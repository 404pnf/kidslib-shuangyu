"在亚瑟王朝廷里的康涅狄格州美国人","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"
"第一章　卡米洛","CHAPTER 1 Camelot"
"“卡米洛——卡米洛，”我自言自语道,“我好像从来没听说过。可能是那个疯人院的名字吧。”","“CAMELOT—Camelot,” said I to myself.“I don’t seem to remember hearing of it before.Name of the asylum, likely.”"
"这里的夏日风光柔和恬静，如梦境般可爱，如礼拜日般冷清。空气中弥漫着花的芬芳，昆虫的鸣叫，鸟儿的呢喃。这里没有人，没有车，没有生活的躁动，什么都没有。脚下的路大部分都弯弯曲曲，路上有蹄印，两边的草丛还时不时出现车轮模糊的痕迹，很明显那些车轮有巴掌宽。","It was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream, and as lonesome as Sunday.The air was full of the smell of flowers, and the buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds, and there were no people, no wagons, there was no stir of life, nothing going on.The road was mainly a winding path with hoof-prints in it, and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in the grass—wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one’s hand."
"不一会儿走来一位漂亮苗条的小姑娘，年纪在十岁上下，金发如瀑布般披在肩上。她头上戴着火红的罂粟花冠。这是我见过的最甜美的打扮，目前为止。她慢悠悠地走着，心境平和，而这平和又显露在她纯真无邪的脸上。那个马戏团的人没有注意到她，甚至好像压根就没看到她。而她——她对他那奇异的装束并没有大吃一惊，而是表现得好像在她日常生活中对他那副样子司空见惯了。她漠不关心地走了过去，就像从两头牛身边经过；但她无意中看到了我，情形突然发生了变化！她扬起双手，好像突然变成了石头，一动不动，大张着嘴巴，眼睛瞪得圆圆的，眼神中流露出胆怯，一副吃惊和好奇中夹杂着害怕的样子。　她站在那里目不转睛地看着，失去了意识般着迷地看着，直到我们转过树林的那个弯，看不到了为止。她见到我如此大吃一惊，而对那个人熟视无睹，真让我受不了，我对此简直是摸不着头脑。她好像把我当作一种奇观来看，而全然忘记了自己在这方面的优势，这又令我纳闷。她小小年纪就能显现出如此宽广的胸襟，真是让人意外。这点很耐人寻味。我向前走着，如在梦中。","Presently a fair slip of a girl, about ten years old, with a cataract of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders, came along.Around her head she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies.It was as sweet an outfit as ever I saw, what there was of it.She walked indolently along, with a mind at rest, its peace reflected in her innocent face.The circus man paid no attention to her; didn’t even seem to see her.And she—she was no more startled at his fantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day of her life.She was going by as indifferently as she might have gone by a couple of cows; but when she happened to notice me, THEN there was a change!Up went her hands, and she was turned to stone; her mouth dropped open, her eyes stared wide and timorously, she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear.And there she stood gazing, in a sort of stupefied fascination, till we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view.That she should be startled at me instead of at the other man, was too many for me; I couldn’t make head or tail of it .And that she should seem to consider me a spectacle, and totally overlook her own merits in that respect, was another puzzling thing, and a display of magnanimity, too, that was surprising in one so young.There was food for thought here.I moved along as one in a dream."
"随着我们靠近那个城镇，生活的迹象开始出现了。我们时不时会路过破烂的小茅草屋，四周是小片小片荒芜的田地和菜园。当然，还有人：男人们身体健壮，头发不梳，又长又乱，垂下来盖住了脸，这使他们看起来像野兽一般。这些男人和女人，大都穿着过膝的粗亚麻袍子，做工粗糙的草鞋，还有许多人脖子上戴着铁圈。小孩子无论男女一律光着身子，但是好像没有人意识到这点。所有人都盯着我，议论我，跑进小屋把全家喊出来目瞪口呆地看着我，但是对于我身边的那个家伙却毫不关注，他们只是向他谦恭地行礼，而那个家伙却对他们所做的努力毫无反应。","As we approached the town, signs of life began to appear.At intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation.There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse, uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look like animals.They and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse tow-linen robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort of sandal, and many wore an iron collar.The small boys and girls were always naked; but nobody seemed to know it.All of these people stared at me, talked about me, ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed that other fellow, except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains."
"镇上有些坚固的石头房子，没有窗户，错落分布在大片的茅草屋间；所谓的街道只不过是弯弯曲曲、没有铺过的小巷。狗儿们和赤身裸体的孩子们都在阳光下玩耍，嘈杂而又充满活力；几头猪四处闲逛，安然地用鼻子拱来拱去找食吃，其中一头躺在大街中央臭烘烘的泥坑里，奶它的小猪崽。突然间远处传来了嘹亮的军乐，越来越近，越来越近，很快一群器宇轩昂的骑兵就逶迤而行，进入我们的视线。他们头戴插着羽毛的头盔，身着闪闪发光的铠甲，旌旗随风飘扬，加上华丽的紧身衣、马鞍毯和镀金的枪尖，真是好不威风；他们雄赳赳地走过污泥和母猪，走过赤身裸体的顽童、活蹦乱跳的狗儿和破烂不堪的茅屋，我们紧随其后。我们随着他们穿过一条又一条蜿蜒的小巷——还是向高处爬呀爬呀——最终我们登上了微风习习的居高点，那里矗立着一座宏伟的城堡。两边用军号声交流了一下，接着墙内的人提出了和谈。城墙内的人全副武装：身着锁子甲，头戴高顶盔，肩抗长戟，来回巡逻，头上旌旗招展，旗上还有简陋的龙形图案。一会儿城门大开，吊桥放了下来，骑兵队长从肃穆的拱门下昂首前行，我们跟在后面。不久我们就来到一处石砖铺就的宽敞院落，四周塔楼高耸入云。我们周围的人纷纷下马，互相行礼问候，跑来跑去，到处是人头攒动，色彩交错，一片欢乐景象；骚动、喧哗与混乱相互交织，令人愉悦。","In the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins; the streets were mere crooked alleys, and unpaved; troops of dogs and nude children played in the sun and made life and noise; hogs roamed and rooted contentedly about, and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family.Presently there was a distant blare of military music; it came nearer, still nearer, and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view, glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners and rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded spearheads; and through the muck and swine, and naked brats, and joyous dogs, and shabby huts, it took its gallant way, and in its wake we followed.Followed through one winding alley and then another,—and climbing, always climbing—till at last we gained the breezy height where the huge castle stood.There was an exchange of bugle blasts; then a parley from the walls, where men-at-arms, in hauberk and morion, marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder under flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon them; and then the great gates were flung open, the drawbridge was lowered, and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under the frowning arches; and we, following, soon found ourselves in a great paved court, with towers and turrets stretching up into the blue air on all the four sides; and all about us the dismount was going on, and much greeting and ceremony, and running to and fro, and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors, and an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion."
"第二章　亚瑟朝廷","CHAPTER 2 King Arthur’s Court"
"我一逮着机会，就偷偷溜到一边，拍拍一个相貌古朴、长相平平的人的肩头，用讨好而亲密的语气说：","THE moment I got a chance I slipped aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said, in an insinuating, confidential way:"
"“朋友，劳驾。你是这个疯人院的，还是只是来参观什么的呢？”","“Friend, do me a kindness.Do you belong to the asylum, or are you just on a visit or something like that?”"
"他傻乎乎地打量着我，说：","He looked me over stupidly, and said:"
"“哎呀，尊敬的阁下，在下似乎——”","“Marry, fair sir, me seemeth—”"
"“这就够了，”我说，“我估摸你是个病人。”","“That will do,” I said; “I reckon you are a patient.”"
"我沉思着走开了，边走还边留神找机会看能不能有一个神志清醒的人碰巧走过来为我指点迷津。不久我判断自己找到了一位。我把他拉到一边，贴着他的耳朵说：","I moved away, cogitating, and at the same time keeping an eye out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come along and give me some light.I judged I had found one, presently; so I drew him aside and said in his ear:"
"“我能不能见见这里的看护长——只要一分钟——”","“If I could see the head keeper a minute—only just a minute—”"
"“请别挡着我。”","“Prithee do not let me.”"
"“挡着你什么？”","“Let you WHAT?”"
"“妨碍我，如果你更中意这个词的话。”然后他又接着说他是个帮厨，不能停下来闲扯，尽管他乐意另找时间谈谈，因为他很想满足一下自己的好奇心，弄清楚我是从哪里搞到这身衣服的。他边走边指着说那边有个人正好闲着，要问就问那个人好了，再说那个人肯定也在找我。那是一个快活的小伙子，身材细长，穿一身虾米色的紧身衣裤，这使他看起来像一根分叉的胡萝卜；他其余的行头就是蓝色绸衫，镶着花哨的蕾丝边和皱褶；他满头长长的黄色卷发，戴着饰有羽毛的粉色缎帽，得意洋洋地斜挂在耳朵上。从长相上看，他脾气不错；从他的步伐看，他对自己是颇为满意。他漂亮得简直可以装到相框里。他走过来，笑眯眯地，还带着点鲁莽的好奇，把我上上下下一番打量，说他是来找我的，还告诉我他是一名侍童。","“HINDER me, then, if the word please thee better.”Then he went on to say he was an under-cook and could not stop to gossip, though he would like it another time; for it would comfort his very liver to know where I got my clothes.As he started away he pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose, and was seeking me besides, no doubt.This was an airy slim boy in shrimp-colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot, the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles; and he had long yellow curls, and wore a plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over his ear. By his look, he was good-natured; by his gait, he was satisfied with himself.He was pretty enough to frame.He arrived, looked me over with a smiling and impudent curiosity; said he had come for me, and informed me that he was a page."
"“一边去，”我说，“你不过是个尿壶。”","“Go ’long,” I said; “you ain’t more than a paragraph.”"
"这话的确相当尖刻，但我真是很生气。但这句话并没有惹急那个小伙子；他似乎没意识到我在损他。我们俩朝前走去，他有说有笑，高高兴兴，说话不经大脑，孩子气十足，立马和我宛若故交。他问我各种各样的问题，关于我自己的，关于我的衣服的，但还没等我回答就一路自己叽里咕噜说了下去，好像他不知道自己问了问题，也并不指望任何答复似的，直到最后他碰巧提到他是五一三年年初出生的。","It was pretty severe, but I was nettled.However, it never phazed him; he didn’t appear to know he was hurt.He began to talk and laugh, in happy, thoughtless, boyish fashion, as we walked along, and made himself old friends with me at once; asked me all sorts of questions about myself and about my clothes, but never waited for an answer—always chattered straight ahead, as if he didn’t know he had asked a question and wasn’t expecting any reply, until at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year 513."
"这句话使我浑身打了个冷颤！我停下脚，用微弱的声音说：","It made the cold chills creep over me!I stopped and said, a little faintly:"
"“也许是我听错了。你再说一遍——慢点说。哪年来着？”","“Maybe I didn’t hear you just right.Say it again—and say it slow.What year was it?”"
"“五一三年。”","“513.”"
"“五一三年！你看起来可不像！行了，孩子，我初来乍到，无朋无友，你可得对我诚实点，尊重我。你脑子没有毛病吧？”","“513!You don’t look it!Come, my boy, I am a stranger and friendless; be honest and honorable with me. Are you in your right mind?”"
"他说没有。","He said he was."
"“这里其他人脑子都没毛病吧？”","“Are these other people in their right minds?”"
"他说他们都没有毛病。","He said they were."
"“那这里不是疯人院吗？我是说，这难道不是他们治疗疯子的地方吗？”","“And this isn’t an asylum?I mean, it isn’t a place where they cure crazy people?”"
"他说不是。","He said it wasn’t."
"“哦，那么，”我说，“要么我是个疯子，要么就是发生了可怕的事。现在告诉我，老老实实地讲真话，我到底在哪儿？”","“Well, then,” I said, “either I am a lunatic, or something just as awful has happened.Now tell me, honest and true, where am I?”"
"“在亚瑟王庭。”","“IN KING ARTHUR’S COURT.”"
"我等了一分钟，好让这句话直达心底，令我不寒而栗，然后我说：","I waited a minute, to let that idea shudder its way home, and then said:"
"“那么照你的意思，现在是哪一年？”","“And according to your notions, what year is it now?”"
"“五二八年——六月十九日。”","“528—nineteenth of June.”"
"我感觉心里一沉，很是悲哀，嘟嘟囔囔地说：“我再也见不到我的朋友了——永远，永远也见不到了。他们还得等一千三百多年才能出生呢。”","I felt a mournful sinking at the heart, and muttered: “I shall never see my friends again—never, never again.They will not be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet.”"
"我似乎很相信这个小伙子，不知为什么。我内心似乎有某种东西相信了他——你也许会说是我的意识；但是我的理智并不相信。我的理智立即开始大声抗议，这是很自然的。我不知道如何做才能让它满意，因为我明白人的证词是起不了作用的——我的理智会说他们都是疯子，把他们的证据都扔得远远的。但忽然之间，纯粹是凭运气，我碰巧找到了方法。我知道六世纪前叶唯一的一次日全食发生在旧历的公元五二八年六月二十一日，正午十二点零三分开始。我还知道，在对我来说的几年，即一八七九年，没有发生过一次日全食。所以，如果我能忍住焦躁和好奇心，忍耐四十八小时，我就能确定这个小伙子是不是在对我讲真话。","I seemed to believe the boy, I didn’t know why.SOMETHING in me seemed to believe him—my consciousness, as you may say; but my reason didn’t.My reason straightway began to clamor; that was natural.I didn’t know how to go about satisfying it, because I knew that the testimony of men wouldn’t serve—my reason would say they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence.But all of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing, just by luck.I knew that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the sixth century occurred on the 21st of June, A. D. 528, O.S., and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon.I also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to ME was the present year—i.e., 1879.So, if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours, I should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not."
"为此，作为一个很讲究实际的康涅狄格州人，现在我把这个问题完全置之脑后，直到它该发生的那天、那个时刻到来，以便我可以把所有的注意力都集中到目前的情况上来，能够心思敏捷，随时准备尽可能搞清楚状况。一时专一事，这是我的座右铭——把事情做到尽善尽美，哪怕它是只有一副对子和一个钩的烂牌。我下定决心要做两件事：如果现在还是在十九世纪，我身处疯子群中，我会要么马上统治这个疯人院，要么找到在这儿的理由；另一方面，如果现在真是六世纪，好吧，我也不会客气：我会在三个月内统治整个国家，因为我断定，凭着那实实在在的一千三百多年，我在这个王国里就是受过最好教育的人。　我是这样的人，一旦下定决心，手头有了事干，就决不浪费时间。于是我对那个侍童说：","Wherefore, being a practical Connecticut man, I now shoved this whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour should come, in order that I might turn all my attention to the circumstances of the present moment, and be alert and ready to make the most out of them that could be made.One thing at a time, is my motto—and just play that thing for all it is worth, even if it’s only two pair and a jack.I made up my mind to two things: if it was still the nineteenth century and I was among lunatics and couldn’t get away, I would presently boss that asylum or know the reason why; and if, on the other hand, it was really the sixth century, all right, I didn’t want any softer thing: I would boss the whole country inside of three months; for I judged I would have the start of the best-educated man in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upward.I’m not a man to waste time after my mind’s made up and there’s work on hand; so I said to the page:"
"“喂，克拉伦斯，我的孩子——如果碰巧你就叫这个名字的话——要是你不介意的话我想跟你打听点事情。把我带到这里的那个幽灵叫什么名字？”","“Now, Clarence, my boy—if that might happen to be your name—I’ll get you to post me up a little if you don’t mind.What is the name of that apparition that brought me here?”"
"“你是说你我的主人？那可是位优秀的骑士，了不起的凯爵士，兼任大总管，咱们国王的同奶兄弟。”","“My master and thine?That is the good knight and great lord Sir Kay the Seneschal, foster brother to our liege the king.”"
"“很好，继续，把所有的事情都告诉我。”","“Very good; go on, tell me everything.”"
"他啰啰嗦嗦长篇大论起来，不过立即引起我兴趣的是这一点：他说我是凯爵士的囚犯，按照惯例我迟早会被投入地牢，扔在那里，缺衣少食，直到我的朋友来赎我——除非我恰巧先烂在狱里了。我明白千钧一发的时刻是最露脸的，不过我并没有浪费时间为此而烦恼：时间太宝贵了。这位侍童又说，这个时候大厅里的晚宴也差不多该结束了，等社交活动和豪饮一开始，凯爵士就会把我带进去，在亚瑟王和他那些声名显赫的圆桌骑士们面前展示，吹嘘他将我一举擒获的赫赫战功，也许还会稍微夸大事实，但我要是纠正他，那就不成体统，而且也不安全。在我被展览完后，我就该回到地牢了，不过他，克莱伦斯，会想法儿时不时来看我，给我打打气，帮我给我的朋友带话。","He made a long story of it; but the part that had immediate interest for me was this: He said I was Sir Kay’s prisoner, and that in the due course of custom I would be flung into a dungeon and left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me—unless I chanced to rot, first.I saw that the last chance had the best show, but I didn’t waste any bother about that; time was too precious.The page said, further, that dinner was about ended in the great hall by this time, and that as soon as the sociability and the heavy drinking should begin, Sir Kay would have me in and exhibit me before King Arthur and his illustrious knights seated at the Table Round, and would brag about his exploit in capturing me, and would probably exaggerate the facts a little, but it wouldn’t be good form for me to correct him, and not over safe, either; and when I was done being exhibited, then ho for the dungeon; but he, Clarence, would find a way to come and see me every now and then, and cheer me up, and help me get word to my friends."
"给我的朋友带话！我向他表示感谢，这可不能不谢。恰在此时一个仆人走来说要我进去，于是克莱伦斯把我领进去，带到一边，在我身旁坐了下来。","Get word to my friends!I thanked him; I couldn’t do less; and about this time a lackey came to say I was wanted; so Clarence led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me."
"啊，这可真是一副奇妙的景象，而且非常有趣。这个地方很大，有点光秃秃的——是的，并且充满了巨大的反差。大厅非常非常之高，高得那些挂在拱梁上的旌旗飘扬起来，如在暮色里般朦胧。两端石栏围就的走廊高高耸立，一边坐的是乐师，一边坐的是身穿艳丽华服的女士。地面铺的是大石板，黑白相间，四四方方，由于年头已久，几经踩踏，破旧不堪，有待修理。至于装饰，严格说来，根本就没有，尽管墙上挂着些巨幅挂毯，可能收税时能被当作艺术品来算吧。挂毯上都是些战争场面，上面的马看起来形如小孩子剪的纸马或者姜饼上的图案，骑在马上的人穿着鳞甲，鳞片由一个个圆窟窿代表——为此整个人的衣服看起来似乎是用饼干压模机压出来的。那里有一个很大的壁炉，大得足以在里面扎营；壁炉突出的边缘和炉盖皆是石头雕刻而成，由柱子支撑，看起来好似大教堂的门。沿墙站着圣骑兵，穿着胸甲，戴着高顶盔，戟是他们唯一的武器——一个个僵硬得好似雕像——他们看上去就是这个样子。","Well, it was a curious kind of spectacle, and interesting.It was an immense place, and rather naked—yes, and full of loud contrasts.It was very, very lofty; so lofty that the banners depending from the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight; there was a stone-railed gallery at each end, high up, with musicians in the one, and women, clothed in stunning colors, in the other.The floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares, rather battered by age and use, and needing repair.As to ornament, there wasn’t any, strictly speaking; though on the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed as works of art; battle-pieces, they were, with horses shaped like those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread; with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by round holes—so that the man’s coat looks as if it had been done with a biscuit-punch.There was a fireplace big enough to camp in; and its projecting sides and hood, of carved and pillared stonework, had the look of a cathedral door.Along the walls stood men-at-arms, in breastplate and morion, with halberds for their only weapon—rigid as statues; and that is what they looked like."
"在有着交叉状拱形圆顶的公共广场正中央放了一张橡木桌子，他们称之为“圆桌”。它有马戏场那么大，四周围坐着一大群人，他们身上的衣服五彩斑斓，颜色如此之绚烂，以至于看了眼睛都要刺伤了。这些人始终戴着饰有羽毛的帽子，除了直接和国王讲话的时候，才在刚要开口时将帽子稍微掀起一点点。","In the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken table which they called the Table Round.It was as large as a circus ring; and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various and splendid colors that it hurt one’s eyes to look at them.They wore their plumed hats, right along, except that whenever one addressed himself directly to the king, he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark."
"他们大多都在喝酒——用整根牛角喝；不过还有几位在嚼着面包或者啃着牛骨头。平均下来每个人身边都有两只狗，满怀期待地坐在一边，等有啃完的骨头扔过来，那时它们就成群结队，一哄而上，一场战争就此打响，狗头狗身向里猛冲，狗尾巴乱摇一气，激烈的咆哮狂吠一时把所有的说话声都压了下去。不过没关系，因为狗儿打架无论如何也比他们的谈话有趣。有时人们会站起来，以便看得更真切，押押宝；女士和乐师从栏杆里探出身来，目的也是一样。大家时不时爆发出阵阵欢呼。　最终，得胜的那只狗舒舒服服地趴下，两只爪子捧着骨头，对着一阵乱吠，接着一通啃咬，弄得一地油腻，正如其它五十只已抢着骨头的狗儿所为；宫廷里的人们也重操旧业，继续取乐。","Mainly they were drinking—from entire ox horns; but a few were still munching bread or gnawing beef bones.There was about an average of two dogs to one man; and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them, and then they went for it by brigades and divisions, with a rush, and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails, and the storm of howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time; but that was no matter, for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest anyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe it the better and bet on it, and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their balusters with the same object; and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time.In the end, the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws, and proceeded to growl over it, and gnaw it, and grease the floor with it, just as fifty others were already doing; and the rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments."
"通常，这些人的言谈举止落落大方，谦恭有节；我还注意只要有人讲话时他们会认真严肃地倾听——我是说在狗儿没有打架的空隙。而且，显而易见，他们犹如孩童，天真无邪，说谎时也用最堂而皇之的方式，加上最温文尔雅、最能打动人心的纯真之气；他们随时愿意聆听别人的谎言，并深信不疑。你很难把他们和残忍、恐怖的事物联系起来，然而他们用相当坦率的口吻讲充满血腥与折磨的故事，让我几乎都忘记了颤抖。","As a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and courtly; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners when anybody was telling anything—I mean in a dog-fightless interval.And plainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot; telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning naivety, and ready and willing to listen to anybody else’s lie, and believe it, too.It was hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful; and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder."
"在场的阶下囚不止我一个。那里还有二十个，或者还要多。可怜的家伙们，许多都被连砍带剁，打伤致残，令人发指；他们的头发、脸上和衣服上都凝结着已经变黑结块、层层浸透的斑斑血迹。当然，他们正忍受着肉体上的剧烈疼痛，无疑，还有疲惫和饥渴；至少没人让他们洗洗舒服舒服，甚至于没人稍微慈悲一下给他们点药水洗洗伤口；但你绝不会听到他们叹息一声，呻吟一下，或者看到他们流露出任何不安的迹象，或抱怨的意图。我不由得想：“这帮恶棍——在他们得势的时候曾这样对待过别人，现在终于轮到他们自己了，所以他们也不指望比这更好的待遇；因此他们处之泰然的忍耐并不是由于受过精神方面的训练，具有理性的坚毅隐忍，和能够推理分析的结果，而仅仅是通过动物般训练得来的；他们是白种印第安人。”","I was not the only prisoner present.There were twenty or more.Poor devils, many of them were maimed, hacked, carved, in a frightful way; and their hair, their faces, their clothing, were caked with black and stiffened drenchings of blood.They were suffering sharp physical pain, of course; and weariness, and hunger and thirst, no doubt; and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash, or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds; yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan, or saw them show any sign of restlessness, or any disposition to complain.The thought was forced upon me: “The rascals—THEY have served other people so in their day; it being their own turn, now, they were not expecting any better treatment than this; so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome of mental training, intellectual fortitude, reasoning; it is mere animal training; they are white Indians.”"
"第三章　圆桌骑士","CHAPTER 3 Knights of the Table Round"
"圆桌会谈主要都是个人的长篇大论——讲述冒险的经历，这些俘虏是如何俘获的，如何杀死他们的朋友和支持者，如何掠走他们的战马和盔甲。大致说来——就我所能了解到的——这些杀人行凶的历险并不是曾饱受残害，为了报仇雪恨而进行攻击，也不是为了平息由来已久的争端或突如其来的决裂；不，通常仅仅是萍水相逢的人之间的决斗——那些在此之前素未谋面，远日无冤近日无仇的人之间的决斗。多少次了，我看到几个孩子，互相根本不认识，偶然碰到，就同时喊：“我要揍你！”便当场打了起来。然而直到现在我一直以为这种事只有小孩子才做得出来，只是孩提时代的标志，但偏偏这里就有这样的大傻瓜，很显然早已成年，岁数不小了，还爱干这样的事，并以此为荣。不过这些显贵的心地单纯的家伙身上也有相当动人之处，迷人而可爱。可以说，把这整间育儿室里的脑子挂在一个鱼钩上当鱼饵好像都不够；不过一会儿你似乎就不会介意了，因为你会很快明白在这样的社会里是不需要脑子的，而且有脑子甚至还会损害这个社会，妨碍它，破坏它的和谐——也许还让它根本无法存在。","MAINLY the Round Table talk was monologues—narrative accounts of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor.As a general thing—as far as I could make out—these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simply duels between strangers—duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.Many a time I had seen a couple of boys, strangers, meet by chance, and say simultaneously, “I can lick you,” and go at it on the spot; but I had always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond.Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and lovable.There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fish-hook with; but you didn’t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and indeed would have marred it, hindered it, spoiled its symmetry—perhaps rendered its existence impossible."
"在每张脸上几乎都可以看到刚毅的男子气概，某些人脸上更有崇高善良的神情，会驳斥你贬低性的批判，让批判声归于沉静。在他们称之为加拉哈德爵士的人脸上，显示着极为高贵仁慈、纯洁无瑕的神情，国王脸上也是如此，而湖中爵士兰斯洛特高大魁梧的身躯更是显现出伟大与威严。","There was a fine manliness observable in almost every face; and in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your belittling criticisms and stilled them.A most noble benignity and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called Sir Galahad, and likewise in the king’s also; and there was majesty and greatness in the giant frame and high bearing of Sir Launcelot of the Lake."
"紧接着发生了一件事，让大家把兴趣都集中到了兰斯洛特爵士身上。一个貌似司仪的人发出了一个信号，然后六名或是八名俘虏就站了起来，一齐走向前，跪在地上，朝着女士们所在的长廊举起手来，恳求王后出言宽恕。这位最为引人瞩目的女士在花团锦簇的美人堆中微微颔首，表示同意，于是俘虏代表就把自己和同伴都交予王后手里，表示无论是无条件赦免、付赎金赎回、囚禁还是处死，都听由她兴致所至随意发落；而这，据他说，是遵从大总管凯爵士的命令所为；他们是凯爵士的俘虏，是凯爵士在战场上单枪匹马，凭自己的英勇神武征服的。","There was presently an incident which centered the general interest upon this Sir Launcelot.At a sign from a sort of master of ceremonies, six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward the ladies’ gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen.The most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bed of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent, and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his fellows into her hands for free pardon, ransom, captivity, or death, as she in her good pleasure might elect; and this, as he said, he was doing by command of Sir Kay the Seneschal, whose prisoners they were, he having vanquished them by his single might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field."
"屋内的人都面面相觑，为之诧异；一听到凯爵士的名字，王后脸上那欣慰的笑容渐渐褪去，看上去很失望；那名侍童附在我的耳边，无论说话的语气还是方式都表现得过分含讥带讽，悄声说：","Surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the house; the queen’s gratified smile faded out at the name of Sir Kay, and she looked disappointed; and the page whispered in my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision—"
"“凯爵士，千真万确！噢，喊我的昵称吧，最最亲爱的，喊我大兵吧！即使再过两千年，邪恶的人类再怎么苦苦争斗，也生不出能撒如此弥天大谎的家伙！”","“Sir KAY, forsooth!Oh, call me pet names, dearest, call me a marine!In twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie!”"
"所有人都目不转睛紧紧盯着凯爵士，眼神中满是疑问。不过凯爵士本人却是处之泰然。他站起身来，犹如无敌高手般耍起了手腕——真是用尽诡计。他声称自己会如实禀告，决不添枝加叶，妄加评论。“到时候，”他说，“如果诸位断定光辉荣耀应物归其主，请归之于为基督而战的队伍中，那位或挺盾抵挡、或拔剑杀敌的力大无穷的勇士——而他本人现也在座！”他指向兰斯洛特爵士。哈，他这下可扭转了大家的想法，这可真是出色的一招。接下来他继续往下讲到，兰斯洛特爵士寻求历险，在转瞬间挥剑一拂斩杀七名巨人，又释放了一百四十二名囚禁的年轻女子，然后继续前行，仍旧寻找历险，发现他（凯爵士）正与九名异国骑士决一死战，立即挺身独揽战局，将九名骑士全部制服；那夜兰斯洛特爵士悄然起身，穿上凯爵士的盔甲，骑上凯爵士的战马，赶往诸多遥远的地方，在一次针锋相对的激战中制服了十六名骑士，又在另一次征服了三十四名；他逼着这些加上前面提到的九名发誓，说在圣灵降临节前后他们会骑马赶到亚瑟王的宫廷，作为大管家凯爵士的俘虏，作为英勇无敌的骑士的手下败将，将自己交到桂乃芬王后的手里；现在这些是其中的半打儿，余下的待到重伤痊愈便即刻赶来。","Every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon Sir Kay.But he was equal to the occasion.He got up and played his hand like a major—and took every trick.He said he would state the case exactly according to the facts; he would tell the simple straightforward tale, without comment of his own; “and then,” said he, “if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto him who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or strake with sword in the ranks of Christian battle—even him that sitteth there!” and he pointed to Sir Launcelot.Ah, he fetched them; it was a rattling good stroke.Then he went on and told how Sir Launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by, killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundred and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, still seeking adventures, and found him (Sir Kay) fighting a desperate fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night Sir Launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in Sir Kay’s armor and took Sir Kay’s horse and gat him away into distant lands, and vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear that about Whitsuntide they would ride to Arthur’s court and yield them to Queen Guenever’s hands as captives of Sir Kay the Seneschal, spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen, and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds."
"啊，看上去真是让人心神荡漾啊，王后面浮红晕，微微一笑，看上去略带害羞而又满怀欣喜，朝着兰斯洛特爵士偷偷瞥去，这要是在阿肯色州，他铁定要被枪毙。","Well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at Sir Launcelot that would have got him shot in Arkansas, to a dead certainty."
"大家纷纷夸赞兰斯洛特爵士的英勇高尚；至于我，我可是十分吃惊：一个人，单枪匹马，竟然能打败擒获如此成群结队训练有素的战士。我如实跟克拉伦斯说了，但是这个爱挖苦人的蠢货只是说：","Everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of Sir Launcelot; and as for me, I was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself, should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions of practiced fighters.I said as much to Clarence; but this mocking featherhead only said:"
"“若凯爵士有时间再喝一袋酸酒，你准会看到这个数目再翻一番。”","“An Sir Kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him, ye had seen the accompt doubled.”"
"我悲哀地看着这个小伙子；看着看着，但见他的脸上浮起一团发自心底的沮丧愁云。我顺着他的目光看去，看到一位胡子花白、老态龙钟的老者，身着飘逸的黑色长袍，起身站在桌边，两腿站立不稳，虚弱地摇着他那老迈的头颅，用他那婆娑泪眼恍恍惚惚地巡视着这帮人。周围每个人都脸上都可以看到像侍童一样受苦受难的神情——是那些不会说话的动物的表情，这些动物知道自己必须默默忍受，不能诉苦呻吟。","I looked at the boy in sorrow; and as I looked I saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance.I followed the direction of his eye, and saw that a very old and white-bearded man, clothed in a flowing black gown, had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs, and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye.The same suffering look that was in the page’s face was observable in all the faces around—the look of dumb creatures who know that they must endure and make no moan."
"“老天，又来了，”小伙子叹口气说，“又要讲那烦人的老掉牙的故事，他都用同样的话讲了一千遍了，他还会一直讲下去至死方休。每次喝满一肚子酒，感觉他那夸大事实的磨坊又开动了，他就要讲一通。让我撞见这样的日子，老天还不如让我死了算了！”","“Marry, we shall have it a again,” sighed the boy; “that same old weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words, and that he WILL tell till he dieth, every time he hath gotten his barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working.Would God I had died or I saw this day!”"
"“那人是谁啊？”","“Who is it?”"
"“默林，超级撒谎精、魔法师，愿地狱之火把他烧焦！老是讲同一个故事烦死人！不过那些人都很惧怕他，因为他能使暴雨、闪电和地狱里的魔鬼都听从他的召唤和驱使；不然，他们多少年前就把他的肠子挖出来，找出那个故事，把它碾个粉碎。他总是用第三人称来讲，假装自己谦虚之极，不会颂扬自己——愿诅咒降临在他的头上，霉运常伴他左右！好兄弟，晚祷时劳驾喊我一声。”","“Merlin, the mighty liar and magician, perdition singe him for the weariness he worketh with his one tale!But that men fear him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the devils that be in hell at his beck and call, they would have dug his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and squelch it.He telleth it always in the third person, making believe he is too modest to glorify himself—maledictions light upon him, misfortune be his dole!Good friend, prithee call me for evensong.”"
"这小伙子偎依在我肩头，假装要睡觉。那老头开始讲他的故事了，不一会儿这小伙子果真睡着了，狗儿们也睡着了，无论是达官贵人，还是奴仆杂役，还有一排排的士兵，都睡着了。那让人昏昏欲睡的单调声音继续嗡嗡下去，四周响起一片柔和的鼾声，如同深沉轻缓的管乐器，为这个声音伴奏。有人将头趴在交叉的胳膊上，有人向后仰着，嘴巴张得大大的，发出无意识的音乐；苍蝇嗡嗡飞着，乱叮一气，没人干扰，成群的耗子从上百个窟窿里悄悄出来，嗒嗒乱跑，把哪儿都当自己家，毫不客气；有一只还坐在了国王的头上，像松鼠般，两只爪子捧着一块奶酪小口啃着，天真无邪而又傲慢无耻地将渣子洒在国王脸上。这真是一个宁静的场景，倒可以让人那困乏的双眼和疲惫的精神得到放松休息。","The boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go to sleep.The old man began his tale; and presently the lad was asleep in reality; so also were the dogs, and the court, the lackeys, and the files of men-at-arms.The droning voice droned on; a soft snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind instruments.Some heads were bowed upon folded arms, some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and made themselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the king’s head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king’s face with naive and impudent irreverence.It was a tranquil scene, and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit."
"以下就是这老头子的故事。他讲道：","This was the old man’s tale.He said:"
"“国王与默林遂启程，见一隐士，乃一虔诚信徒兼妙手神医。乃查其伤口，并赠良药；国王在此小驻三天，至伤口愈合，且能乘骑，遂告辞离开。二人乘马行于路上，亚瑟王言道，朕无剑。无碍*（*此处为马克吐温的脚注，指没有关系），默林曰，乃有宝剑一柄，君必得之，臣愿效力。","“Right so the king and Merlin departed, and went until an hermit that was a good man and a great leech.So the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go, and so departed.And as they rode, Arthur said, I have no sword.No force *, said Merlin, (hereby is a * Footnote from M.T.: no matter. )sword that shall be yours and I may."
"于是二人骑马前行，乃见一湖，碧波万顷，美不胜收；亚瑟王遥见湖心有手臂一只，白色锦缎裹就，宝剑一口，擎于手中。瞧，默林说，彼处即为臣提及之宝剑。随之二人见一女子行于湖面。该女子何许人也？亚瑟王问道。","So they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.Lo, said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I spake of.With that they saw a damsel going upon the lake.What damsel is that? said Arthur."
"此乃湖中夫人是也，默林答道，湖中立一巨石，美轮美奂，观之富丽堂皇，不亚陆地；此女子顷刻即来见驾，我主可稍加谀辞，使伊献剑于圣上。说话之间该女子就来到了亚瑟王身前，行礼问候，亚瑟王还礼。女士，亚瑟王问道，远处水面上手臂所擎是何剑？寡人无剑，愿得此剑。亚瑟陛下，该女子言道，此剑乃奴家之物，如圣上能依奴家所求施以小礼，奴家自当奉上。朕敢以名誉担保，亚瑟王回道，无论所求何物，朕定当应允。既然如此，女子说道，请陛下移驾到远处舟上，自行划至剑旁，连同剑鞘一同取下，到时奴家必当告知所要之物。于是亚瑟王与默林翻身下马，将马栓于两棵树上，登舟行至擎剑手臂之处，亚瑟王提起剑柄将剑取走。那只手臂连同手掌沉入了水中；君臣二人弃舟登岸，继续骑马前行。不久亚瑟王即见一华丽帐营。远处出现帐营是为何故？此乃一骑士之帐，默林答道，即上回陛下与之交手之培利诺爵士，现出帐未归；他与圣上麾下的一位骑士，名叫埃格拉姆的，起了纷争，二人战作一团，末了埃格拉姆落荒而逃，不然定会丧命；培利诺骑士直追至卡利恩。吾等少顷便可于大路上与之相遇。此言甚是，亚瑟王言道，今寡人一剑在手，大可举而攻之，报仇雪耻。陛下，万万不可，默林道，那位骑士一路厮杀追逐，已疲惫不堪，陛下如此时交手，胜之不武；更兼当今骑士能轻易与之匹敌者绝无一人，因此以臣愚见，放他一马，此卿不久即将为陛下尽忠效力，其身后子子孙孙也必当如此。且此时指日可待，陛下当将御妹欣然许配于他。见到此人，寡人必依卿所言，亚瑟王说道。亚瑟王细观宝剑，越看越爱不释手。陛下哪个爱之更甚，默林问道，是宝剑还是剑鞘？寡人更中意宝剑，亚瑟王答道。陛下此乃不智之举，默林说道，剑鞘所值胜于剑身十倍，况剑鞘在手陛下永免受伤流血之痛；因此，请您好好保管，使之片刻不离君身。君臣二人骑马前往卡利恩，路上遇到了培利诺爵士；但默林施了魔法，培利诺看不到亚瑟王，默默走了过去。　朕十分诧异，亚瑟王说道，这位骑士竟一言不发。陛下，默林答道，他看不到你，如被他看到，陛下岂能如此轻易脱身。二人遂来到卡利恩，亚瑟王手下众骑士来往见到，皆十分欣喜。当众骑士闻听亚瑟王奇遇，皆对亚瑟王如此只身履险甚为诧异。然有德之士皆曰，得首领如此，乃乐事一桩，愿如其他穷苦骑士之所为，投身历险，为之效劳。”","That is the Lady of the lake, said Merlin; and within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth, and richly beseen, and this damsel will come to you anon, and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.Anon withal came the damsel unto Arthur and saluted him, and he her again.Damsel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the arm holdeth above the water?I would it were mine, for I have no sword.Sir Arthur King, said the damsel, that sword is mine, and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it.By my faith, said Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask.Well, said the damsel, go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I see my time.So Sir Arthur and Merlin alight, and tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him.And the arm and the hand went under the water; and so they came unto the land and rode forth.And then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion.What signifieth yonder pavilion?It is the knight’s pavilion, said Merlin, that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore, but he is out, he is not there; he hath ado with a knight of yours, that hight Egglame, and they have fought together, but at the last Egglame fled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased him even to Carlion, and we shall meet with him anon in the highway.That is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword, now will I wage battle with him, and be avenged on him.Sir, ye shall not so, said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also, he will not lightly be matched of one knight living; and therefore it is my counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short time, and his sons, after his days.Also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed. When I see him, I will do as ye advise me, said Arthur.Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.Whether liketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard?Me liketh better the sword, said Arthur.Ye are more unwise, said Merlin, for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword, for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded; therefore, keep well the scabbard always with you.So they rode into Carlion, and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done such a craft that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed by without any words.I marvel, said Arthur, that the knight would not speak.Sir, said Merlin, he saw you not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed.So they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad.And when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would jeopard his person so alone.But all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did.”"
"第四章　幽默大师丁纳丹爵士","CHAPTER 4 Sir Dinadan the Humorist"
"在我看来，这番离奇的谎话讲得最为简单明了，美妙非常。但那时我只听了一遍，这就造成了很大的不同。毫无疑问，在头一回听这个故事的时候，别人也觉得很有趣。","IT seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully told; but then I had heard it only once, and that makes a difference; it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh, no doubt."
"第一个醒来的是幽默大师丁纳丹爵士。他搞了个很无聊的恶作剧，很快把大家都吵醒了。他把几个金属杯子拴在一只狗的尾巴上，然后放开狗儿，那只狗就吓疯了似的绕着一个地方转圈，其他的狗追着它汪汪乱叫，横冲直撞，才不管是什么挡着道，于是乎闹闹哄哄，嘈杂不堪，吵得人耳朵都要聋了；在场的男男女女笑得眼泪都流出来了，更有甚者笑得从椅子上栽了下来，乐得满地打滚。这可真像是一群孩子。丁纳丹爵士对于自己的杰作甚为得意，以至于忍不住将自己如何碰巧想出这个绝招讲了一遍又一遍，讲到令人厌烦。而且正如他同类的幽默家一样，直到大家都笑够了他还在笑个不停。他讲得是如此起劲以至于决心要发表一篇演说——当然是幽默的演说。我感觉自己平生从未听过这么多老掉牙的笑话凑在一起。他简直比吟游诗人还要差劲，比马戏团的小丑还要糟糕。现在坐在这里似乎特别悲惨，在距我出生还有一千三百年的时候，又一次听那差劲而又无味、被虫子蛀空了的笑话，而这些笑话在一千三百年后作为孩子的我听起来都会肚子疼。这几乎让我确信，世上压根就不可能有诸如新笑话之类的东西。当时，人人都为这些老古董笑话哈哈大笑——不过他们一向如此；我在几个世纪后就注意到这点了。然而，那个爱挖苦人的家伙无疑没有笑——我是说那个男孩。没错，他在讽刺挖苦；这世上就没有一件事他不挖苦讽刺的。他说丁纳丹爵士的笑话大都烂透了，其余的都变成化石了。我说“变成化石”这个说法不错；我本人也相信，要将那些有了年纪的笑话分类，地质年代是唯一适合的途径。但是我这个绝佳的想法可把小伙子给搞懵了，因为那时地质学还没发明出来呢。不过，我还是将那句话记了下来，要是我能渡过这关，我打算提高全国人民的教育，好让他们都领会它。仅因市场尚未成熟就丢弃好东西，这样做可没什么好处。","Sir Dinadan the Humorist was the first to awake, and he soon roused the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality.He tied some metal mugs to a dog’s tail and turned him loose, and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright, with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and turmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed till the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs and wallowed on the floor in ecstasy.It was just like so many children.Sir Dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling over and over again, to weariness, how the immortal idea happened to occur to him; and as is the way with humorists of his breed, he was still laughing at it after everybody else had got through.He was so set up that he concluded to make a speech—of course a humorous speech.I think I never heard so many old played-out jokes strung together in my life.He was worse than the minstrels, worse than the clown in the circus.It seemed peculiarly sad to sit here, thirteen hundred years before I was born, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that had given me the dry gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards.It about convinced me that there isn’t any such thing as a new joke possible.Everybody laughed at these antiquities—but then they always do; I had noticed that, centuries later.However, of course the scoffer didn’t laugh—I mean the boy.No, he scoffed; there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t scoff at.He said the most of Sir Dinadan’s jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified.I said “petrified” was good; as I believed, myself, that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by geologic periods.But that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn’t been invented yet. However, I made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate the commonwealth up to it if I pulled through.It is no use to throw a good thing away merely because the market isn’t ripe yet."
"这时凯爵士站起身来，将我当作燃料，开始发动起他那历史的机器。是时候该我感觉不妙了，而我确实感觉不妙。凯爵士讲述他如何在一个遥远的野蛮人国度遇到了我，那些野蛮人都像我一样穿着荒诞可笑的衣服——那衣服是由魔法制成，穿上它，普通人是无法加害于你的。话虽如此，他还是依靠祈祷的力量破了这个魔法，经过三个小时的战斗，杀死了我方十三名骑士，俘获了我，并免我一死，为得就是能将我这个稀罕物展示给国王和文武百官，让大家啧啧称奇，赞赏不已。他自始至终都用最乏味的口吻谈论我，称我为“这位非凡的巨人”，或是“这位可怕的摩天怪物”，还有“这位獠牙利爪的食人妖怪”，大家也都天真之极地对这番胡话信以为真，没有一个人会心一笑，或发现我和这些掺假的数据间有着怎样的出入。他还讲到，为了逃走，我纵身一跃，跳到了一颗两百腕尺高的大树上，但是他用大如牛般的巨石将我砸了下来，由此我几乎全身的骨头都“碎如齑粉”；他还命我对天发誓，说我一定会出现在亚瑟王的宫廷里接受审判。末了，他判我在二十一号中午接受死刑，他对此还真是漠然，在宣布死刑日期之前还停下来打了个哈欠。","Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with me for fuel.It was time for me to feel serious, and I did.Sir Kay told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, who all wore the same ridiculous garb that I did—a garb that was a work of enchantment, and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands.However he had nullified the force of the enchantment by prayer, and had killed my thirteen knights in a three hours’ battle, and taken me prisoner, sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as I was might be exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court.He spoke of me all the time, in the blandest way, as “this prodigious giant,” and “this horrible sky-towering monster,” and “this tusked and taloned man-devouring ogre”, and everybody took in all this bosh in the naivest way, and never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me.He said that in trying to escape from him I sprang into the top of a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound, but he dislodged me with a stone the size of a cow, which “all-to brast” the most of my bones, and then swore me to appear at Arthur’s court for sentence.He ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st; and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named the date."
"此时我满心凄凉，甚至心里乱到都听不明白他们在争论怎样用最好的办法杀死我，因为有人担心我衣服上有魔法而杀不死我。其实那只不过是从服装店花十五美元买来的普普通通的衣服。说归说，我神智还算清醒，注意到了这样一个细节，即这一大群国内最上等的淑女绅士用最平铺直叙的语气说出来的许多字眼是会让科曼奇人面红耳赤的。用“粗俗”一词来形容简直就太委婉了。不过，我读过《汤姆·琼斯》和《罗得里克·兰登》等诸如此类的书，所以我很清楚，一百多年前英国最高贵最上等的淑女绅士在谈吐上或者谈吐中折射的道德和举止方面也还是那么不干不净；事实上，直到我们身处的十九世纪——在这个世纪，大概说来，在英国历史上，或者说欧洲历史上，就此而言，我们能够发现的最早的真正淑女和真正绅士的榜样才崭露头角。假如瓦尔特·司各特爵士不是编好了对话送入他笔下人物的嘴里，而是容许他们自己来说，会怎样？那样丽贝卡，艾凡赫和温柔的罗伊纳女士就会说出让今天的流浪大军听了都害臊的话语了。话说回来，对于那些根本意识不到有伤大雅的人来说，一切皆是无伤大雅。亚瑟王的子民们意识不到自己有失体面，而我也留了个心眼儿，对此只字不提。","I was in a dismal state by this time; indeed, I was hardly enough in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to how I had better be killed, the possibility of the killing being doubted by some, because of the enchantment in my clothes.And yet it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slopshops.Still, I was sane enough to notice this detail, to wit: many of the terms used in the most matter-off-act way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would have made a Comanche blush.Indelicacy is too mild a term to convey the idea.However, I had read “Tom Jones,” and “Roderick Random,” and other books of that kind, and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in England had remained little or no cleaner in their talk, and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies, clear up to a hundred years ago; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century—in which century, broadly speaking, the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable in English history—or in European history, for that matter—may be said to have made their appearance.Suppose Sir Walter, instead of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters, had allowed the characters to speak for themselves?We should have had talk from Rebecca and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena which would embarrass a tramp in our day. However, to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate.King Arthur’s people were not aware that they were indecent and I had presence of mind enough not to mention it."
"他们为我那具有魔法的衣服苦恼不已，后来还是老家伙默林说了一句只不过是常识的话，才扫清了障碍，让大家如释重负。他问他们为何如此之蠢，怎么就想不到扒光我的衣服。才半分钟的时间我就赤条条好似一对火钳了。而且，哎呀，想想吧，我是在场唯一一个感到难为情的人！人人都在议论我，议论起来还事不关己的样子，好似我是一颗白菜。桂乃芬王后也和大家一样天真烂漫地兴趣盎然，还说她以前从未看到有谁长着像我那样的双腿。这是我得到的唯一恭维——如果这也能算作是恭维的话。","They were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved, at last, when old Merlin swept the difficulty away for them with a common-sense hint.He asked them why they were so dull—why didn’t it occur to them to strip me.In half a minute I was as naked as a pair of tongs!And dear, dear, to think of it: I was the only embarrassed person there.Everybody discussed me; and did it as unconcernedly as if I had been a cabbage.Queen Guenever was as naively interested as the rest, and said she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before.It was the only compliment I got—if it was a compliment."
"最终我和我那危险的衣服分头被带走了。我被推进地牢的一间黑暗狭小的小屋里，少得可怜的残羹冷炙就是我的饭食，床则是发霉的稻草，还有无穷无尽的耗子与我做伴。","Finally I was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothes in another.I was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon, with some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed, and no end of rats for company."
"第五章　灵光乍现","CHAPTER 5 An Inspiration"
"我已是精疲力尽，尽管万分恐惧，还是没撑多久就睡过去了。","I WAS so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long."
"当我醒来时，感觉似乎睡了好久了。我的第一个念头就是：“哎呀，我做了个多奇怪的梦啊！估摸我醒得正及时，还没被人绞死、淹死、烧死什么的……还是再打个盹儿吧，等到汽笛响起，就到兵工厂去和赫尔克里士一决雌雄。”","When I next came to myself, I seemed to have been asleep a very long time.My first thought was, “Well, what an astonishing dream I’ve had!I reckon I’ve waked only just in time to keep from being hanged or drowned or burned or something....I’ll nap again till the whistle blows, and then I’ll go down to the arms factory and have it out with Hercules.”"
"可就在这个当儿，我听到生锈锁链和门闩发出的刺耳声音，接着眼前亮光一闪，那只花蝴蝶，克拉伦斯，站到了我面前！我惊奇地倒抽了一口气，呼吸几乎都停止了。","But just then I heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts, a light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, Clarence, stood before me!I gasped with surprise; my breath almost got away from me."
"“怎么！”我说道，“你还在这儿？赶紧和我余下的梦一起走开吧！解散！”","“What!” I said, “you here yet?Go along with the rest of the dream! scatter!”"
"但他只是大笑，以他一贯没心没肺的方式，开始拿我的悲惨境遇取笑。","But he only laughed, in his light-hearted way, and fell to making fun of my sorry plight."
"“好吧，”我无可奈何地说，“让梦继续吧，反正我也不急。”","“All right,” I said resignedly, “let the dream go on; I’m in no hurry.”"
"“敢问是什么梦？”","“Prithee what dream?”"
"“什么梦？哎，就是我在亚瑟王宫廷里的梦——那个人根本就不存在，梦到我和你说话，而你只不过是想象中的人物。”","“What dream?Why, the dream that I am in Arthur’s court—a person who never existed; and that I am talking to you, who are nothing but a work of the imagination.”"
"“啊呀，的确！那你明天就要被烧死了也是个梦吗？哈哈——看你怎么回答我！”","“Oh, la, indeed!and is it a dream that you’re to be burned to-morrow?Ho-ho—answer me that!”"
"我被吓得浑身打了个激灵，心情无比沮丧。此时我开始推断，无论是不是梦，我的境况都严峻到了极点；因为我凭过去的经验知道生活和梦境极其相似，被烧死，即使在梦里，也不是闹着玩的，也要拼命避开，无论用什么方法，只要能想到，都要千方百计避免。于是我恳求道：","The shock that went through me was distressing.I now began to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious, dream or no dream; for I knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity of dreams, that to be burned to death, even in a dream, would be very far from being a jest, and was a thing to be avoided, by any means, fair or foul, that I could contrive.So I said beseechingly:"
"“啊，克拉伦斯，好孩子，我唯一的朋友——因为你的确是我的朋友，是吧？——你可不能辜负我；帮我想个办法从这个地方逃出去吧！”","“Ah, Clarence, good boy, only friend I’ve got,—for you ARE my friend, aren’t you?—don’t fail me; help me to devise some way of escaping from this place!”"
"“你听听自己都在说什么话！逃走？哎，老哥，过道里都有士兵把守着呢。”","“Now do but hear thyself!Escape? Why, man, the corridors are in guard and keep of men-at-arms.”"
"“那是，那是。可是有多少守卫，克拉伦斯？不太多吧，但愿？”","“No doubt, no doubt.But how many, Clarence?Not many, I hope?”"
"“整整二十名。谁也别想逃出去。”　他顿了一下，犹犹豫豫地说：“而且还有其他的原因——更重要的原因。”","“Full a score.One may not hope to escape.”　After a pause—hesitatingly: “and there be other reasons—and weightier.”"
"“别的原因？什么呀？”","“Other ones?What are they?”"
"“哦，他们说——哦，我不敢说，真的不敢说！”","“Well, they say—oh, but I daren’t, indeed daren’t!”"
"“喂，可怜的孩子，到底是什么事？你为什么畏畏缩缩的？怎么抖成这样？”","“Why, poor lad, what is the matter?Why do you blench?Why do you tremble so?”"
"“哎呀，实不相瞒，这也由不得我！我倒是想告诉你来着，不过——”","“Oh, in sooth, there is need!I do want to tell you, but—”"
"“来吧，来吧，勇敢点，像个男子汉——说出来，才是好孩子！”","“Come, come, be brave, be a man—speak out, there’s a good lad!”"
"他迟疑不决，想说又不敢说，接着偷偷跑到门口瞥了几眼，听了听，最后蹑手蹑脚凑到我跟前，嘴对着我的耳朵，悄声告诉我那可怕的消息，他一副畏畏缩缩胆怯的样子，好像正身临险境，只要话一出口就有杀身之祸似的。","He hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear; then he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finally crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news in a whisper, and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very mention might be freighted with death."
"“默林，心肠太歹毒，已经对这个地牢下了咒语，方圆诸国有哪个不要命的敢企图与你跨越它的界限！啊呀上帝可怜可怜我吧，我还是说了！啊，行行好吧，我对您是一片好心，您对我也发发慈悲吧；您要是出卖了我我可就完蛋了！”","“Merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, and there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate enough to essay to cross its lines with you!Now God pity me, I have told it!Ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy who means thee well; for an thou betray me I am lost!”"
"这回我可是真正舒心地笑了一把，好久以来都没这么笑过了，我高声喊道：","I laughed the only really refreshing laugh I had had for some time; and shouted:"
"“默林下咒语了！默林，老天！那个一钱不值的老骗子，那个唠唠叨叨的老傻驴？屁话，纯粹是屁话，世上最最愚蠢的屁话！哼，在我看来，从古至今所有的迷信，无论多么幼稚可笑，愚昧无知，没头没脑，胆小如鼠，也没有——哦，该死的默林！”","“Merlin has wrought a spell!MERLIN, forsooth!That cheap old humbug, that maundering old ass?Bosh, pure bosh, the silliest bosh in the world!Why, it does seem to me that of all the childish, idiotic, chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions that ev—oh, damn Merlin!”"
"但是我还没说完克拉伦斯就扑通跪倒在地，吓得简直要疯了。","But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half finished, and he was like to go out of his mind with fright."
"“噢，大意不得！你这些话太可怕了！你要是说这样的话，周围的墙随时都会轰然倒下压扁我们的。赶紧收回你的话吧，趁现在还为时未晚！”","“Oh, beware!These are awful words!Any moment these walls may crumble upon us if you say such things.Oh call them back before it is too late!”"
"此时这怪异的举止表现反而让我有了个好主意，使我动起脑筋来。要是这里人人都和克拉伦斯一样，如此打心底里惧怕默林那装腔作势的魔法，那么像我这么优秀的人，应该足够机灵，想出好办法来好好利用一下目前的情形。我一路想了下去，就想出了一个方案。然后我说道：","Now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to thinking.If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid of Merlin’s pretended magic as Clarence was, certainly a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to take advantage of such a state of things.I went on thinking, and worked out a plan.Then I said:"
"“起来。打起精神来，看着我的眼睛。你知道我为什么笑吗？”","“Get up. Pull yourself together; look me in the eye.Do you know why I laughed?”"
"“不知道——但看在圣母的份上，不要再笑了。”","“No—but for our blessed Lady’s sake, do it no more.”"
"“那么，我告诉你我为什么笑。因为我本人就是一位魔法师。”","“Well, I’ll tell you why I laughed.Because I’m a magician myself.”"
"“你！”　那孩子倒退了一步，屏住了呼吸，因为这事对他来说太突然了，不过他表现出来的态度倒是非常非常恭敬。我立刻注意到了这点，这说明在这个疯人院里骗子不需要有什么名望；即使没有名望，人们照样会言听计从。我接着说下去。","“Thou!” 　The boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, for the thing hit him rather sudden; but the aspect which he took on was very, very respectful.I took quick note of that; it indicated that a humbug didn’t need to have a reputation in this asylum; people stood ready to take him at his word, without that.I resumed."
"“我认识默林有七百年了，而他——”","“I’ve know Merlin seven hundred years, and he—”"
"“七百——”","“Seven hun—”"
"“别打岔。他死而复活，活而又死，来来回回有十三次了，他每次闯荡都换个新名字：史密斯，琼斯，鲁滨逊，杰克逊，彼得斯，哈斯金斯，默林——露一次面，换一个新化名。三百年前我在埃及认识过他，五百年前我在印度认识过他——不论我到哪儿，都会碰到他在胡说八道，我都烦透了。作为魔法师，他连菜鸟都不够格，只知晓几个老套的戏法，从来没出学徒期，一辈子也甭想出。跑跑外省，演演夜场什么的，他还能对付过去，你明白的——可是，老天，他可不该冒充行家呀——反正有真正的行家在场的时候他可不该逞能。现在听我说，克拉伦斯，我打算永远做你的朋友，马上，而作为回报你也必须做我的朋友。我要你帮个忙。我要你帮我递个话给国王，说我也是个魔法师——还是至尊无敌重量级大人物，业界泰斗；我要让他明白我正在这里暗中策划一个小小的灾难，凯爵士的计划如果实施，伤着我一点，我就会闹得举国不宁，鸡飞狗跳。你能帮我把这些话带给国王吗？”","“Don’t interrupt me.He has died and come alive again thirteen times, and traveled under a new name every time: Smith, Jones, Robinson, Jackson, Peters, Haskins, Merlin—a new alias every time he turns up.I knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago; I knew him in India five hundred years ago—he is always blethering around in my way, everywhere I go; he makes me tired.He don’t amount to shucks, as a magician; knows some of the old common tricks, but has never got beyond the rudiments, and never will.He is well enough for the provinces—one-night stands and that sort of thing, you know—but dear me, HE oughtn’t to set up for an expert—anyway not where there’s a real artist.Now look here, Clarence, I am going to stand your friend, right along, and in return you must be mine.I want you to do me a favor.I want you to get word to the king that I am a magician myself—and the Supreme Grand High-yu-Muckamuck and head of the tribe, at that; and I want him to be made to understand that I am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these realms if Sir Kay’s project is carried out and any harm comes to me.Will you get that to the king for me?”"
"那个可怜孩子处于如此的情形，简直无法回答我的问话。看到一个大活人这样惊恐万分，这样灰心丧气，这样斗志全无，真是可怜啊。不过，他还是一切都答应我了；而我这方面，他则要求我一遍遍发誓我会永远做他的朋友，永不对他翻脸或是对他施加魔法。然后他才手扶着墙强撑着慢慢走了出去，好似一个病人。","The poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me.It was pitiful to see a creature so terrified, so unnerved, so demoralized.But he promised everything; and on my side he made me promise over and over again that I would remain his friend, and never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him.Then he worked his way out, staying himself with his hand along the wall, like a sick person."
"霎时我突然想到：我怎么那么粗心啊！那个孩子冷静下来，会纳闷为何像我这样的大魔法师会去求他那样的孩子来帮我摆脱这个地方；他把这两件事放一块儿一想，就会明白我是个骗子。","Presently this thought occurred to me: how heedless I have been!When the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place; he will put this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug."
"我为自己粗心大意酿成的大错整整焦躁了一个小时，同时把自己骂了个狗血喷头。可是最后我突然想到，这些动物根本不会推理；他们才不会把两件事联系到一起想想呢；他们的言谈处处表明他们遇到自相矛盾的情形也压根不知道。这样我心里可就踏实了。","I worried over that heedless blunder for an hour, and called myself a great many hard names, meantime.But finally it occurred to me all of a sudden that these animals didn’t reason; that THEY never put this and that together; that all their talk showed that they didn’t know a discrepancy when they saw it.I was at rest, then."
"然而在这个世上，人心里刚一踏实，就会为别的事而烦恼。我突然想到自己还犯了一个错误：我打发那个孩子通过一个恐吓来向他的长官们发出警告——我打算抽空制造一场灾难；而那些最易于相信奇迹，最急于相信奇迹，最乐于相信奇迹的人，就是那些最急切看到你来展示奇迹的人；如果有人要我做出个样子看看，怎么办？如果有人要我给我造的灾难立个名目，怎么办？的确，我犯了个错误；我应该先制造出灾难来。“我该如何是好？我该说点什么来为自己赢得点时间呢？”　我再一次陷入麻烦了；最麻烦的麻烦：……“有脚步声！——他们来了。要是我还有一点点时间来思索……有了，我有主意了。这下好了。”","But as soon as one is at rest, in this world, off he goes on something else to worry about.It occurred to me that I had made another blunder: I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat—I intending to invent a calamity at my leisure; now the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you perform them; suppose I should be called on for a sample?Suppose I should be asked to name my calamity?Yes, I had made a blunder; I ought to have invented my calamity first.“What shall I do? what can I say, to gain a little time?”I was in trouble again; in the deepest kind of trouble:... “There’s a footstep!—they’re coming.If I had only just a moment to think....Good, I’ve got it. I’m all right.”"
"你瞧，我想到的正是日蚀。在这千钧一发之时，我突然想起来了，哥伦布，也许是科尔特斯，反正是这类人中的一员，就曾对着一群野人把日蚀当救命王牌来耍，我可瞧见我的机会了。现在我也可以耍一把了，而且这可不能算作是剽窃，因为我这可比他们差不多早了一千年呢。","You see, it was the eclipse.It came into my mind in the nick of time, how Columbus, or Cortez, or one of those people, played an eclipse as a saving trump once, on some savages, and I saw my chance.I could play it myself, now, and it wouldn’t be any plagiarism, either, because I should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties."
"克拉伦斯进来了，垂头丧气，愁眉苦脸，说道：","Clarence came in, subdued, distressed, and said:"
"“小人十万火急地将消息通告国王陛下，陛下即刻宣我觐见。他吓得魂不附体，有意立即命人将你释放，赐你锦衣华服，所居之处也当依贵人之礼；哪知默林来了，把事情搞砸了；他劝谏国王陛下，说你疯疯癫癫，胡言乱语；他还说你的威胁只不过是头脑发昏，瞎说闲扯。君臣二人争论良久，末了，默林含讥带讽地说：‘那厮缘何不说明是何灾祸？定然是他说不出来。’这番言语使国王顿时哑口无言，无言以对，于是心不甘情不愿，只能将你怠慢，事已至此，陛下还请你多加体谅他的窘境，并阐明灾祸名目——若果真如此，请你讲明灾祸是何性质，何时到来。啊，请不要拖延；你已经深陷罗网，此时拖延无异于要增加两倍甚至三倍的危险。啊，放聪明点吧——说出灾难的名目吧！”","“I hasted the message to our liege the king, and straightway he had me to his presence.He was frighted even to the marrow, and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement, and that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great; but then came Merlin and spoiled all; for he persuaded the king that you are mad, and know not whereof you speak; and said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing.They disputed long, but in the end, Merlin, scoffing, said, ‘Wherefore hath he not NAMED his brave calamity?Verily it is because he cannot.’ This thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king’s mouth, and he could offer naught to turn the argument; and so, reluctant, and full loth to do you the discourtesy, he yet prayeth you to consider his perplexed case, as noting how the matter stands, and name the calamity—if so be you have determined the nature of it and the time of its coming.Oh, prithee delay not; to delay at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already compass thee about.Oh, be thou wise—name the calamity!”"
"我沉默了一会儿，攒足了威风劲儿，然后才开口道：","I allowed silence to accumulate while I got my impressiveness together, and then said:"
"“我被关在这个窟窿里多久了？”","“How long have I been shut up in this hole?”"
"“昨天黄昏时分你被关进来的。现在是早上九点。”","“Ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent. It is 9 of the morning now.”"
"“不！那么我一定是睡得很熟。现在都是上午九点了！黑咕隆咚的，就是半夜三更的样子。那今天是二十号了？”","“No!Then I have slept well, sure enough.Nine in the morning now!And yet it is the very complexion of midnight, to a shade.This is the 20th, then?”"
"“二十号——是的。”","“The 20th—yes.”"
"“而我明天就要被活活烧死了。”　那孩子浑身哆嗦起来。","“And I am to be burned alive to-morrow.” 　The boy shuddered."
"“几时啊？”","“At what hour?”"
"“正午。”","“At high noon.”"
"“那好，我告诉你该怎么说。”我顿了一下，盯着那个畏畏缩缩的小伙子足有一分钟一言不发，让人毛骨悚然；然后，我用低沉的声音，用不急不缓的、厄运重重的语气讲了起来，而且我的音调越升越高，直至最大的高潮，我平生从未讲得如此令人赞叹，卓越非凡：“回去禀告国王，说在那个时辰我会将整个世界都笼罩在半夜三更的黑暗里；我会遮住太阳，让它永世不再发光；大地上的果实会由于缺少阳光和温暖而腐烂，而地球上的人类则会饥饿而死，直至死光！”","“Now then, I will tell you what to say.” I paused, and stood over that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence; then, in a voice deep, measured, charged with doom, I began, and rose by dramatically graded stages to my colossal climax, which I delivered in as sublime and noble a way as ever I did such a thing in my life: “Go back and tell the king that at that hour I will smother the whole world in the dead blackness of midnight; I will blot out the sun, and he shall never shine again; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack of light and warmth, and the peoples of the earth shall famish and die, to the last man!”"
"我只得自己把那个孩子架了出去，他已经瘫倒在地了。我把他交给了卫兵，然后就回来了。","I had to carry the boy out myself, he sunk into such a collapse.I handed him over to the soldiers, and went back."
"第六章　日蚀","CHAPTER 6 The Eclipse"
"在寂静与黑暗中，对于现实的认知会很快弥补知识的不足。仅仅知道一个事实是苍白无力的，但是当你意识到了你的事实，它马上就有了色彩。那就是听说一个人被捅死和亲眼目睹一个人被捅死的差别。在寂静与黑暗中，我对于身处致命危险这一事实的认知在不断加深着自己的意义。一种对现实的认识一英寸一英寸地爬进我的血管，使我浑身冰冷。","IN the stillness and the darkness, realization soon began to supplement knowledge.The mere knowledge of a fact is pale; but when you come to REALIZE your fact, it takes on color.It is all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to the heart, and seeing it done.In the stillness and the darkness, the knowledge that I was in deadly danger took to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the time; a something which was realization crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold."
"不过大自然拥有一条造福于人的法则，在这种时候，一个人的水银柱跌落到一个定点，就会马上回升，那他就回复元气了。希望突然冒出来，喜悦也随之而来，接着人就有精神去为自己做点事，如果有事可做的话。我恢复起来简直就是一跃而起。我心里想，我的日蚀一定能救我的命，而且把我变成全国最伟大的人物。我的水银柱立即就升到了玻璃管的顶端，满腹忧虑登时烟消云散了。我是世界上最快乐的人了。我甚至等不及明天的到来了，我满心巴望着能获得那个伟大的胜利，成为全国人民好奇与敬仰的中心。此外，从生意经上来看，这还能使我一举成名，我深谙其道。","But it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these, as soon as a man’s mercury has got down to a certain point there comes a revulsion, and he rallies.Hope springs up, and cheerfulness along with it, and then he is in good shape to do something for himself, if anything can be done.When my rally came, it came with a bound.I said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me, and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides; and straightway my mercury went up to the top of the tube, and my solicitudes all vanished.I was as happy a man as there was in the world.I was even impatient for tomorrow to come, I so wanted to gather in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation’s wonder and reverence.Besides, in a business way it would be the making of me; I knew that."
"同时我还把一件事搁在心里，位置稍稍靠后。那就是，我已有五分相信，一旦那些迷信的人得到报告，得知我打算制造一场怎样的灾难，那消息会有这样一种效果，他们想要让步。于是，过了一会儿当我听到脚步声时，这个想法重回我的脑海，我对自己说：“没错，来讲和了。哼，如果条件不错，好吧，我就接受；但如果不好，我打算寸步不让，斗争到底。”","Meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background of my mind.That was the halfconviction that when the nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious people, it would have such an effect that they would want to compromise.So, by and by when I heard footsteps coming, that thought was recalled to me, and I said to myself, “As sure as anything, it’s the compromise.Well, if it is good, all right, I will accept; but if it isn’t, I mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it is worth.”"
"门开了，几名士兵走了进来。为首的那位说道：","The door opened, and some men-at-arms appeared.The leader said:"
"“火刑柱准备好了。走吧！”","“The stake is ready.Come!”"
"火刑柱！我全身没有一点力气，差点儿摔倒。在这个当儿，我的喉咙噎住了，冷气倒抽，要想呼吸一下都困难；但是，一旦我能说出话来，我就说道：","The stake!The strength went out of me, and I almost fell down.It is hard to get one’s breath at such a time, such lumps come into one’s throat, and such gaspings; but as soon as I could speak, I said:"
"“一定是弄错了——行刑是在明天。”","“But this is a mistake—the execution is tomorrow.”"
"“命令改了，提前了一天。　麻利点，你！”","“Order changed; been set forward a day. 　Haste thee!”"
"我完了。我没救了。我不知所措，一片茫然。我的身体都不听使唤了，只是像丢了魂儿似的瞎转悠。于是士兵抓住我，拖着我跟他们走出了牢房，沿着迷宫般的地下通道，最终来到了日光强烈刺眼的地面上。刚走进城堡那个四面围墙的大院子里，我就吓了一跳，我一眼就瞅见那个火刑柱立在中央，旁边堆着干柴，还站着一位僧侣。院子四周坐满了人，一排比一排高，构成了一层层色彩斑斓的倾斜的梯田。国王和王后坐在宝座上，自然是最引人注目的人物。","I was lost.There was no help for me.I was dazed, stupefied; I had no command over myself, I only wandered purposely about, like one out of his mind; so the soldiers took hold of me, and pulled me along with them, out of the cell and along the maze of underground corridors, and finally into the fierce glare of daylight and the upper world.As we stepped into the vast enclosed court of the castle I got a shock; for the first thing I saw was the stake, standing in the center, and near it the piled fagots and a monk.On all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank above rank, forming sloping terraces that were rich with color.The king and the queen sat in their thrones, the most conspicuous figures there, of course."
"看完这些，只花了一秒的时间。第二秒钟，克拉伦斯不知从哪个藏身之处蹦了出来，喋喋不休地向我耳朵里灌着新闻，眼里闪烁着胜利和喜悦。他说：","To note all this, occupied but a second.The next second Clarence had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news into my ear, his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness.He said:"
"“多亏了我，才改过来了！为了这个，我可是费了好大劲呢。可是当我告诉他们即将发生的灾祸时，瞧见由此产生的巨大恐慌，我就马上明白该出手了！因此我卖劲地装模作样，东扯西扯，说得到明日你对付太阳的法力才能达到极致；所以要想拯救太阳，拯救世界，必须趁今天你的魔法还在酝酿中，法力不足的时候就把你杀掉。呜哩哇啦，只不过是一通无聊鬼话，最离谱的瞎编乱造，但他们却吓得惊慌失措，把谎言当作上天降下的救星，全盘接受，信以为真，你可真该瞧瞧他们那副模样；这期间我就一会儿偷偷发笑，笑他们这么容易就上当了，一会儿又赞美上帝，感谢他肯借他造物中最卑微的人之手来拯救您的性命。啊，事情进展得可真是顺心！您就无需加害于太阳了——啊，可别忘了，千万记住！只要弄黑一丁点儿——只要最微小的一丁点儿，就打住吧，切记。那便足矣。他们都会认为我所言有误——认为小人愚昧无知——而随着第一抹黑暗的阴影降临，您就瞧吧，他们定会吓得发疯，马上将您释放，尊为上人！时辰已到，愿旗开得胜！只是望您谨记——啊，好朋友，我恳请您记住我的祈求，千万不要加害那神圣的太阳。看在您真诚的朋友的份上。”","“’Tis through ME the change was wrought!And main hard have I worked to do it, too.But when I revealed to them the calamity in store, and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender, then saw I also that this was the time to strike!Wherefore I diligently pretended, unto this and that and the other one, that your power against the sun could not reach its full until the morrow; and so if any would save the sun and the world, you must be slain to-day, while your enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency.Odsbodikins, it was but a dull lie, a most indifferent invention, but you should have seen them seize it and swallow it, in the frenzy of their fright, as it were salvation sent from heaven; and all the while was I laughing in my sleeve the one moment, to see them so cheaply deceived, and glorifying God the next, that He was content to let the meanest of His creatures be His instrument to the saving of thy life.Ah how happy has the matter sped!You will not need to do the sun a REAL hurt—ah, forget not that, on your soul forget it not!Only make a little darkness—only the littlest little darkness, mind, and cease with that.It will be sufficient.They will see that I spoke falsely,—being ignorant, as they will fancy—and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear; and they will set you free and make you great!Go to thy triumph, now!But remember—ah, good friend, I implore thee remember my supplication, and do the blessed sun no hurt.For MY sake, thy true friend.”"
"我心中满是悲伤凄凉，哽咽着挤出几个字，也就是我不会为难太阳；那孩子一听，看着我，眼睛散发出充满了爱戴的深切感激之情，我真不忍心告诉他，他那好心办成的傻事害了我，把我送上了死路。","I choked out some words through my grief and misery; as much as to say I would spare the sun; for which the lad’s eyes paid me back with such deep and loving gratitude that I had not the heart to tell him his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death."
"士兵们架着我穿过庭院，此时四周一片寂静，要是蒙上眼睛，我准以为自己是孤身一人，而不是身边团团围了四千人。成群的人当中一点动静也没有，大家身体僵直，面色灰白，仿佛是石头人，每个人的脸色都透着恐惧。我被锁到火刑柱上时，依然是一片肃静。他们把柴火小心翼翼、没完没了地从我的脚踝堆到膝盖，堆到大腿，堆到全身时，四周依然鸦雀无声。然后他们停了一下，四周更寂静了，如果还能更寂静的话；一人手持熊熊火把屈膝跪在我脚下，众人都向前探出身子，目不转睛，身体稍稍离开座位却盲然不知；那位僧侣将双手举过我的头顶，眼望蓝天，用拉丁语祈祷起来；他就这样嗡嗡说着，说了一会儿，然后停了下来。我等了两三分钟，随后抬头望去，只见他站在那里，好像变成了石头。大家不约而同地慢慢站起身来，凝视着天空。我随着他们的目光看去，千真万确，我的日蚀开始了！此刻我热血沸腾，生机勃勃，与刚才判若两人！黑色的圆环缓慢地向太阳中心推进，我的心也跳得越来越厉害，而那帮人和那位教士则盯着天空，一动不动。我知道这注视随后就会转到我的身上。当它转过来时，我也有了准备。我摆出平生最有气派的姿态，展开上臂直指太阳。 那效果可真盖了。你可以瞧见人群中如波浪涌过，抖成一片。两声喊叫突然响起，一声紧随一声：","As the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was so profound that if I had been blindfold I should have supposed I was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people.There was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity; they were as rigid as stone images, and as pale; and dread sat upon every countenance.This hush continued while I was being chained to the stake; it still continued while the fagots were carefully and tediously piled about my ankles, my knees, my thighs, my body.Then there was a pause, and a deeper hush, if possible, and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch; the multitude strained forward, gazing, and parting slightly from their seats without knowing it; the monk raised his hands above my head, and his eyes toward the blue sky, and began some words in Latin; in this attitude he droned on and on, a little while, and then stopped.I waited two or three moments; then looked up; he was standing there petrified.With a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and stared into the sky.I followed their eyes, as sure as guns, there was my eclipse beginning!The life went boiling through my veins; I was a new man!The rim of black spread slowly into the sun’s disk, my heart beat higher and higher, and still the assemblage and the priest stared into the sky, motionless.I knew that this gaze would be turned upon me, next.When it was, l was ready.I was in one of the most grand attitudes I ever struck, with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun.  It was a noble effect. You could SEE the shudder sweep the mass like a wave.Two shouts rang out, one close upon the heels of the other:"
"“点火！”","“Apply the torch!”"
"“给我住手！”","“I forbid it!”"
"前一声来自默林，而另一声发自国王。默林从座位上起身——我断定他是要亲自点火。我说：","The one was from Merlin, the other from the king.Merlin started from his place—to apply the torch himself, I judged.I said:"
"“都呆着别动。要是未经我的准许有人动了——即使是国王本人——我照样会用天雷将其劈死，用闪电将其烧成灰烬！”","“Stay where you are. If any man moves—even the king—before I give him leave, I will blast him with thunder, I will consume him with lightnings!”"
"大家都乖乖坐了回去，不出我所料。默林迟疑了一两分钟，这让我犹如芒刺在背。接着他坐了下来，我这才好好松了口气，此刻我明白局面尽在我的掌握之中了。国王说：","The multitude sank meekly into their seats, and I was just expecting they would.Merlin hesitated a moment or two, and I was on pins and needles during that little while.Then he sat down, and I took a good breath; for I knew I was master of the situation now.The king said:"
"“阁下，请以慈悲为怀，莫要企图再次加深危难之事，以免灾祸随之而来。先前有报传来，称阁下的法力要到明日才到达极致，不过——”","“Be merciful, fair sir, and essay no further in this perilous matter, lest disaster follow.It was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow; but—”"
"“陛下以为那是一派谎言？的确如此。”","“Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie?It WAS a lie.”"
"此话一出，掀起轩然大波；四面八方的人都举手欢呼，国王被淹没在暴风雨般的祈求声里，要他不惜一切代价收买我，将灾祸拒之门外。国王也急于应允。他说：","That made an immense effect; up went appealing hands everywhere, and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that I might be bought off at any price, and the calamity stayed.The king was eager to comply.He said:"
"“尊敬的阁下，请您随意提出条件，即使是平分寡人江山亦可；但万万请您消灾祛祸，万勿加害太阳！”","“Name any terms, reverend sir, even to the halving of my kingdom; but banish this calamity, spare the sun!”"
"这下我算是大功告成了。我原可一分钟之内就接受他的祈求，但我可阻挡不了日蚀；这事可是无能为力。因此我请他给我点时间容我考虑考虑。国王说：","My fortune was made.I would have taken him up in a minute, but I couldn’t stop an eclipse; the thing was out of the question.So I asked time to consider.The king said:"
"“几时——但不知要几时，好心的阁下？请发发慈悲吧；瞧，天色已愈来愈黑，一刻暗似一刻了。敢问还要几时？”","“How long—ah, how long, good sir?Be merciful; look, it groweth darker, moment by moment.Prithee how long?”"
"“用不了多久。半个小时——也许一个小时。”","“Not long.Half an hour—maybe an hour.”"
"数以千计的人提出令人怜悯的抗议，不过我却无法缩短，因为我记不得日蚀全程要持续多长时间了。反正我是满心迷茫，需要好好想想。这次日蚀有点问题，情况很让人不安。这次日蚀要不是我想要的那个，我该如何知道这是在六世纪，还是只不过是个梦呢？老天，我要是能证明是后者就好了！我有了令人高兴的新希望了。如果那个孩子日子没弄错，这就一定是二十世纪，而不是六世纪。我兴奋万分地去拉那位僧侣的袖子，问他今天是几号。","There were a thousand pathetic protests, but I couldn’t shorten up any, for I couldn’t remember how long a total eclipse lasts.I was in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think.Something was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling.If this wasn’t the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream?Dear me, if I could only prove it was the latter!Here was a glad new hope.If the boy was right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it WASN’T the sixth century.I reached for the monk’s sleeve, in considerable excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was."
"天杀的，他说今天是二十一号！我听了后凉了半截。我求他不要把日子弄错了，但他很肯定，他知道今天是二十一号。如此说来，那个没脑子的孩子又把一切都搞砸了！日蚀的时辰正对；刚开始的时候，从旁边的日晷上我亲眼看到的。不错，我是在亚瑟王的朝廷里，我不妨就顺水推舟。","Hang him, he said it was the TWENTY-FIRST!It made me turn cold to hear him.I begged him not to make any mistake about it; but he was sure; he knew it was the 21st.So, that feather-headed boy had botched things again!The time of the day was right for the eclipse; I had seen that for myself, in the beginning, by the dial that was near by.Yes, I was in King Arthur’s court, and I might as well make the most out of it I could."
"天是越来越黑了，人们也变得越来越苦恼。这时我说：","The darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more and more distressed.I now said:"
"“我考虑了一下，国王陛下。为了教训你们一下，我会让黑暗继续下去，让整个世界笼罩在黑夜里；不过我是永远遮住太阳，还是恢复它的光芒，那就看你们的了。这就是我的条件：您还当您的国王，君临天下，四方景仰，君威永享；但您要任我为您的终身宰相，掌管国政，增加国库收入，使之高于目前指数，一旦见效，请以我为国家创造财富之百分之一为我的酬劳。　如果我不能凭这个糊口，也不会找谁去要求提高数目。陛下对此是否满意？”","“I have reflected, Sir King.For a lesson, I will let this darkness proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether I blot out the sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you.These are the terms, to wit: You shall remain king over all your dominions, and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship; but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive, and give me for my services one percent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeed in creating for the state.  If I can’t live on that, I sha’n’t ask anybody to give me a lift.Is it satisfactory?”"
"顿时掌声雷动，其间国王提高声音，说：","There was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midst of it the king’s voice rose, saying:"
"“给他松绑，放了他！尔等无论尊卑贵贱，皆要向其参拜；此卿今已为本王重臣，重权相倾，其位仅居本王之下！望扫清茫茫潜入之夜色，回复光明，重获欢欣，到时人人会为爱卿祈福。”","“Away with his bonds, and set him free! and do him homage, high and low, rich and poor, for he is become the king’s right hand, is clothed with power and authority, and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne!Now sweep away this creeping night, and bring the light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee.”"
"我却说道：","But I said:"
"“要是一个普通人在万众面前受辱，那倒不算什么；可是，如果眼见一国之相赤身露体而无法得以雪耻，那国王未免颜面无光。我可否请求将衣服还我——”","“That a common man should be shamed before the world, is nothing; but it were dishonor to the KING if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame.If I might ask that my clothes be brought again—”"
"“那些衣服有碍观瞻，”国王插嘴说道，“快取锦衣华服，将他装束得犹如王公贵族！”","“They are not meet,” the king broke in.　“Fetch raiment of another sort; clothe him like a prince!”"
"我的算盘成功了。我想保持现状，直至太阳达到全蚀，否则他们还会请我驱走黑暗，而我当然是办不到了。派人取衣服为我赢得了一点拖延时间，但还不够。于是我不得不另找借口。我说，国王一时激动所做之事，过后改变主意而反悔，那也是很自然的事情；因此我要让这黑暗再长一会儿，要是相当一段时间过去之后，国王仍未变卦，那我再驱散黑暗。不管是国王还是其他人都对这个安排不满，但是我必须坚持到底。","My idea worked.I wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness, and of course I couldn’t do it.Sending for the clothes gained some delay, but not enough.So I had to make another excuse.I said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while, and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same, the darkness should be dismissed.Neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement, but I had to stick to my point."
"天变得越来越暗，越来越黑，这个当儿我正手忙脚乱地穿那套蹩脚的六世纪服装。最后天终于变得一片漆黑，大家感觉到诡异的晚风习习吹过，星斗也出现在天空，闪闪烁烁，不禁毛骨悚然，一片哀叫。太阳终于全蚀了，我是非常高兴的，不过其他人可就痛苦了；这也是很自然的。我说：","It grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker, while I struggled with those awkward sixth-century clothes.It got to be pitch dark, at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky. At last the eclipse was total, and I was very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; which was quite natural.I said:"
"“国王陛下未置一词，那就是还遵守诺言了。”　　随后我举起双手——就这样站了片刻——然后用极度严肃的口吻说：“魔法解除吧，不带一丝伤害地消失吧！”","“The king, by his silence, still stands to the terms.” 　Then I lifted up my hands—stood just so a moment—then I said, with the most awful solemnity: “Let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away!”"
"片刻之间，没有一点儿变化，天还是黑漆漆的，四周像墓地般安静。可是过了一两分钟，当太阳的银边跃然而出时，大家发出阵阵欢呼，并用祝福与感激如洪水般将我淹没了；当然，克拉伦斯此时岂能甘居人后。","There was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush.But when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude; and Clarence was not the last of the wash, to be sure."
"第七章　默林的塔楼","CHAPTER 7 Merlin’s Tower"
"既然我如今成了国内第二号人物，就政治权力和威信而言，我发生了很大的变化。我穿的是绫罗绸缎、天鹅绒和金丝线，因此看起来华丽无比，也很不舒服。不过不久我就会习以为常了，对此我很清楚。我住的房间是整个城堡中最讲究的一套，仅次于国王的。房间里挂满了颜色华丽的丝绸帷幔，金碧辉煌；然而石头地面上却只铺着灯心草，权当地毯，那些灯心草长势杂乱，铺在地上有点不像样。至于便利，确切地说，压根儿就没有。我指的是小小的便利；正是那小小的便利才给生活带来真正的舒适。大橡木椅子上刻着简陋的雕刻，还算不错，但仅此而已。这里没有肥皂，没有火柴，没有镜子——除了一面金属镜子，其照人效果相当于一桶水。而且，没有多彩石印画。多少年来我已经习惯了生活中有多彩石印画，如今我才明白，不知不觉中对艺术的热爱已深深植入我的骨髓，成为我自身的一部分。在这花哨俗气而又毫无温情的荒蛮之地，四下看看，不由得勾起了我的思乡之情；记得在东哈特佛，我们家里虽然朴实无华，但无论走进哪个屋子你都会发现一张保险公司的石印画，或者至少是一张三色“上帝保佑我家”贴在门上，而客厅里我们贴了九张。但在这里，即使是在我那气派的王室府邸，没有一样能被称为图画的，除了一幅被子大的东西，也不知是编的还是织的（上面还有几块补丁），要色没色，要形没形；谈到各部分的比例，即使拉斐尔本人也绝不会搞得更惨不忍睹；那家伙在搞了一大堆能让人做噩梦的东西之后他的作品竟被人称为是“大名鼎鼎的汉普顿宫廷画稿”。　拉斐尔是个怪胎。我们有几张他的多彩石印画；一张是他的“捕鱼神迹图”，在那张画上他自己造了个奇迹——一只独木舟，即使放一只狗也会翻掉，他竟然放了三个人上去。我一向喜欢研究拉斐尔的艺术，那真是让人耳目一新，不落俗套。","INASMUCH as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far as political power and authority were concerned, much was made of me.My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold, and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.But habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that.I was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after the king’s.They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings, but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet, and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed.As for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren’t any. I mean LITTLE conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life.The big oaken chairs, graced with rude carvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place.There was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass—except a metal one, about as powerful as a pail of water.And not a chromo.I had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my being, and was become a part of me.It made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending as it was, you couldn’t go into a room but you would find an insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home over the door; and in the parlor we had nine.But here, even in my grand room of state, there wasn’t anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions, even Raphael himself couldn’t have botched them more formidably, after all his practice on those nightmares they call his “celebrated Hampton Court cartoons.” Raphael was a bird. We had several of his chromos; one was his “Miraculous Draught of Fishes,” where he puts in a miracle of his own—puts three men into a canoe which wouldn’t have held a dog without upsetting.I always admired to study R.’s art, it was so fresh and unconventional."
"城堡中甚至连电铃或者传话筒都没有。我手底下有很多仆人，当班时都无所事事地呆在前厅；要是需要人，我得自己跑去喊。　这里没有煤气，没有蜡烛；一只青铜盘子，装着半盘公寓里用的那种黄油，漂着块点着了的破布，发出的光就是所谓的灯光了。像破布一样的灯还有很多，在墙上一溜儿挂着，修饰了一下黑暗，使它恰好显得阴森森的。你要是晚上外出，得要仆人拿着火把。这儿没有书，没有笔墨纸张，在他们认作窗户的那些开口上也没有玻璃。那本来是个小东西——我说的是玻璃——到了没有玻璃的时候，玻璃就变成大东西了。不过，最糟糕的也许就是，无论是糖、咖啡、茶还是烟草，这里是一点都没有。我看出来了，我就是另一个漂流到无人荒岛上的鲁滨逊·克鲁索，身旁没有同类，只有或多或少几只驯化的动物，要是我打算让日子过得下去，我就得像他那样做——发明，策划，创造，重新安排组织，让手脑都动起来，不让它们闲着。嗯，这才是我该做的呢。","There wasn’t even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle.I had a great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him.  There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full of boarding -house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light. A lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it down enough to make it dismal.If you went out at night, your servants carried torches.There were no books, pens, paper or ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows.It is a little thing—glass is—until it is absent, then it becomes a big thing.But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn’t any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco.I saw that I was just another Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life bearable I must do as he did—invent, contrive, create, reorganize things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy.Well, that was in my line."
"起初有件事一直困扰着我——那就是大家都对我太感兴趣了。显然全国的人都想瞧瞧我。不久我就得知，那场日蚀把全英国的人都吓得差点死掉了；日蚀时，全国从这头到那头，都是惊恐万状，可怜得很，而教堂、修道院和庙宇里挤满了可怜虫，以为世界末日来临，在那儿痛哭祈祷。接着有消息传来，说制造这可怕事件的是个外来者，亚瑟王宫廷的大法师，他能像吹灭一支蜡烛一样吹灭太阳；正当他打算这么做时，被人疏通，大发慈悲，解除了魔法，而今被万人尊崇，认定他单枪匹马，凭一人之力使地球免于毁灭，使人类免于灭绝。此刻如果你能想想，这个消息谁都相信，不但相信，甚至连做梦都不会怀疑，那你就很容易明白，整个英国没有一个人不想走五十里的路来看我一眼。当然所有的话题都是围绕我——其他话题早就没人提起，乃至国王也恶名立减，没有以前那么让人感兴趣了。不出二十四小时，代表团就开始来到了，而从这时起一直有两个周，来人还是络绎不绝。不光是村里，整个乡下都挤满了人。我一天得出去十好几次，将自己展示给那群毕恭毕敬、战战兢兢的人看。这事既费时又麻烦，成了很大的负担，话说回来，同时能够享有盛名，受人景仰，自然也稍稍补偿了一下，让人舒坦。这可让默林老哥嫉妒不已，愤愤不平，脸都气绿了，可真叫我开心。不过有一件事我还不太明白——没有一个人请我签名。我为此问了克拉伦斯。苍天啊！我还得跟他解释什么是亲笔签名。而后他说本国除了十几位牧师外，就没有人能读书写字的。天哪！真是不可思议。","One thing troubled me along at first—the immense interest which people took in me. Apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me. It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country, from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come.Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur’s court; that he could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going to do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction.Now if you consider that everybody believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me. Of course I was all the talk—all other subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety.Within twentyfour hours the delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming.The village was crowded, and all the countryside.I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe-stricken multitudes.It came to be a great burden, as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage.It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which was a great satisfaction to me.  But there was one thing I couldn’t understand—nobody had asked for an autograph.I spoke to Clarence about it.By George!I had to explain to him what it was.Then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests.Land! think of that."
"还有一件事也多少让我苦恼。那一大帮子人不久就开始闹着要再显一回神通。这也没什么奇怪的。要是能将这份牛皮带回遥远的家乡，说自己亲眼见到那位连驰骋天际的太阳都得乖乖听他支使的大法师，那左邻右舍肯定会把他们看成了不起的大人物，全都得眼红呢；而要是还能再说自己亲眼看到那位魔法师显灵——哎呀，那大家就该大老远地跑来看他们啦。　压力变得相当大了。将来还会有一次月蚀，我也知道日期和时间，不过有点太遥远了。两年之后。要是能使它加速到来，马上派上用场，我愿意付出很大代价来获得这个许可，趁着目前行情不错。如此白白浪费，真是太可惜了，等到没人需要了，再磨磨蹭蹭地来了，那简直跟不来一样。要是预定到一个月后交货，我还能短期卖空；可是，照目前的情况，我看来是想不出任何办法让它对我有利了，于是我只好放弃尝试的念头。紧接着，克拉伦斯发现默林那老家伙正忙着在那些人中暗地捣鬼。他散布消息说我是个骗子，而我之所以不顺应大家的要求显个神通，是因为我根本就不会。我明白自己必须做点什么了。很快我就想出了个计策。","There was another thing that troubled me a little.Those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle.That was natural.To be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they had seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the heavens, and be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors, and envied by them all; but to be able to also say they had seen him work a miracle themselves—why, people would come a distance to see THEM.The pressure got to be pretty strong.There was going to be an eclipse of the moon, and I knew the date and hour, but it was too far away.Two years.I would have given a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was a big market for it.It seemed a great pity to have it wasted so, and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn’t have any use for it, as like as not. If it had been booked for only a month away, I could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, I couldn’t seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so I gave up trying.Next, Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself busy on the sly among those people.He was spreading a report that I was a humbug, and that the reason I didn’t accommodate the people with a miracle was because I couldn’t.I saw that I must do something.I presently thought out a plan."
"凭着我身居宰相要职的权力，我把默林投入了监狱——就关在我原来住过的那间牢房。接着我派传令官用号角来通告公众，说我两个周内都会忙着处理国家事务，两周一过，我将抽空用天火把默林的石头塔楼给炸了。与此同时，谁要是听信了诋毁我的流言蜚语，那可得当心了。再者，我这次施展的魔法仅此一个，不再多行；要是有人还不满意，私下嘀嘀咕咕，我就要把他们变成马，让他们派点用场。此言一出，马上平静了。","By my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison—the same cell I had occupied myself.Then I gave public notice by herald and trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for a fortnight, but about the end of that time I would take a moment’s leisure and blow up Merlin’s stone tower by fires from heaven; in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him beware.Furthermore, I would perform but this one miracle at this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured, I would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.Quiet ensued."
"在一定程度上，我把克拉伦斯当成了我的心腹，暗暗进行起来。我对他说这次显灵需要稍作准备，而即使是向任何人提起这些准备工作，也会登时身亡。这下可就把他的嘴封得严严实实了。我们秘密地造了好几蒲式耳的头等炸药，我又监督指挥手下的兵器匠建造了一个避雷针和一些铁丝。这座古老的石头塔楼非常宏伟——受损也相当严重，因为是罗马时期建的，有四百年历史。不错，还相当美观大方，风格粗犷，从塔基到塔顶都爬满了常春藤，好似披着一身鱼鳞软甲。它耸立在一片孤零零的高地上，离这儿大约有半英里远，从城堡看去，一目了然。","I took Clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we went to work privately.I told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.That made his mouth safe enough.Clandestinely we made a few bushels of first-rate blasting powder, and I superintended my armorers while they constructed a lightningrod and some wires.This old stone tower was very massive—and rather ruinous, too, for it was Roman, and four hundred years old.Yes, and handsome, after a rude fashion, and clothed with ivy from base to summit, as with a shirt of scale mail.It stood on a lonely eminence, in good view from the castle, and about half a mile away."
"我们在夜里工作，把火药填到塔楼里——从墙里面把石头挖出来，然后将火药埋到墙体里，塔基的墙有十五英尺厚。我们一次放一培克（注：培克为英美计量单位，约合三十六公升）炸药，放在十几个地方。那些炸药都够炸毁伦敦塔了。到了第十三天的晚上，我们安装避雷针，将它插在一堆火药里，然后用铁丝将它与各堆火药连接起来。自我发布公告之日起大家都对塔楼敬而远之，但到了第十四日的早上我觉得最好还是通过传令官警告大家，躲得远远的——躲到四分之一英里外。此后根据我的命令，又加了一句，说在二十四小时内我将会施展魔法，但事先会简要通报一下；如果是在白天，就在城堡上竖起旗帜，如果是在晚上，就在城堡上挂出火笼。","Working by night, we stowed the powder in the tower—dug stones out, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves, which were fifteen feet thick at the base.We put in a peck at a time, in a dozen places.We could have blown up the Tower of London with these charges.When the thirteenth night was come we put up our lightning-rod, bedded it in one of the batches of powder, and ran wires from it to the other batches.Everybody had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation, but on the morning of the fourteenth I thought best to warn the people, through the heralds, to keep clear away—a quarter of a mile away.Then added, by command, that at some time during the twenty-four hours I would consummate the miracle, but would first give a brief notice; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime, by torch-baskets in the same places if at night."
"这些日子，雷阵雨还算常见，因此我倒不担心会失败；而且，拖后一两天我也不太在乎；我可以解释说自己还在忙于国家大事，大家必须再等等。","Thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and I was not much afraid of a failure; still, I shouldn’t have cared for a delay of a day or two; I should have explained that I was busy with affairs of state yet, and the people must wait."
"当然，我们赶上了一个艳阳天——三个星期以来万里无云还是头一回；事情总是如此。我闭门不出，密切观察着天气。克拉伦斯时不时跑进来说公众的激动情绪一直在高涨，从城垛上放眼望去，整个郊区都挤满了人，人山人海的。终于起风了，云彩也飘了过来——时间正好，正好是傍晚时分。我观望了一会儿，看远方那片云扩展开来，越变越黑，随后我断定到了我该出场的时刻了。我吩咐点上火笼，放出默林并带他来见我。十五分钟后我登上胸墙，发现国王和满朝文武都已聚在那里，在黑暗中远远望着默林的塔楼。暮色已深，看不清远处；人群和那些古老的角楼，一半浸没在黑漆漆的阴影里，一半笼罩在头顶巨大火笼发出的红光里，构成了好一幅画面。","Of course, we had a blazing sunny day—almost the first one without a cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.I kept secluded, and watched the weather.Clarence dropped in from time to time and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the time, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far as one could see from the battlements.At last the wind sprang up and a cloud appeared—in the right quarter, too, and just at nightfall.For a little while I watched that distant cloud spread and blacken, then I judged it was time for me to appear.I ordered the torch-baskets to be lit, and Merlin liberated and sent to me.A quarter of an hour later I ascended the parapet and there found the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness toward Merlin’s Tower.Already the darkness was so heavy that one could not see far; these people and the old turrets, being partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great torch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture."
"默林垂头丧气地来了。我说：","Merlin arrived in a gloomy mood.I said:"
"“当初我无意伤害于你的时候你却要将我活活烧死，后来还企图毁坏我的职业声誉。因此我要召下天火，炸毁你的塔楼，但是只有给你一次机会才算公平；现在如果你认为你能破了我的魔法，挡住天火，那就出招吧，就看你的了。”","“You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm, and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional reputation.Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up your tower, but it is only fair to give you a chance; now if you think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires, step to the bat, it’s your innings.”"
"“吾可出招，阁下，且吾定出招。足下不必多疑。”","“I can, fair sir, and I will.Doubt it not.”"
"他在屋顶的石头上虚虚地画了个圈，在圈内点了一小撮粉末状的东西，冒出一小团带香味的烟雾，闻了后人人都向后退，开始画起了十字，并且觉得浑身不舒服。随之他开始嘴里念念有词，双手在空中挥来挥去。他慢慢进入了状态，逐渐变得癫狂起来，两只胳膊抡得滴溜乱转，仿佛磨坊的风车。当时暴风雨就要来到我们这片了；阵阵狂风吹着火把，火光摇曳不止，影子也飘飘忽忽，大大的雨点已经开始往下掉，四处一片漆黑，天上开始不时打起闪来。当然了，我的避雷针现在也应该把电引下来了。实际上，事情迫在眉睫。因此我说：","He drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnt a pinch of powder in it, which sent up a small cloud of aromatic smoke, whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves and get uncomfortable.Then he began to mutter and make passes in the air with his hands.He worked himself up slowly and gradually into a sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing around with his arms like the sails of a windmill.By this time the storm had about reached us; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and making the shadows swash about, the first heavy drops of rain were falling, the world abroad was black as pitch, the lightning began to wink fitfully.Of course, my rod would be loading itself now. In fact, things were imminent.So I said:"
"“你用的时间够长了。我已经让你占尽先机，也没有打扰你。很显然你的魔法不灵。现在轮到我了，这才公平。”","“You have had time enough.I have given you every advantage, and not interfered.It is plain your magic is weak.It is only fair that I begin now.”"
"我在空中比划了三下，紧接着轰隆一声巨响，那座古老的塔楼顿成炸成碎片飞上了天，随之而来的是火山爆发般冲天的火焰，把夜空照得犹如白昼，足足有一千亩地面上的人都趴在地上，吓得魂飞魄散，神志不清。那个周剩下的几天砖头瓦块一直像下雨般往下落。这是报告上来的，可能跟事实有所出入。","I made about three passes in the air, and then there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday, and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground in a general collapse of consternation.Well, it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week.This was the report; but probably the facts would have modified it."
"这次显灵真有效果。那一大帮子令人非常讨厌的暂住人口消失了。第二天早上，泥浆里遍布着好几千双脚印，不过都是向外跑的方向。假如我公开宣传说我要再显一次神通，即使是郡长来了也招不来一个观众。","It was an effective miracle.The great bothersome temporary population vanished.There were a good many thousand tracks in the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.If I had advertised another miracle I couldn’t have raised an audience with a sheriff."
"默林的台柱算是倒了。国王想要停他的薪水；他甚至想要赶他走，但是我插手了。我说要他去报报天气或者管些诸如此类的琐事，还是派得上用场的，而且他那蹩脚的小客厅把戏跟他过不去的时候我也会不时帮帮他。他的塔楼连块碎片也没剩下，但我让政府为他重建了一座，还建议他招些房客，不过他心高气傲，拒绝了。而至于感谢呢，他连句谢谢都没说过。无论你怎么看，他都是一副苦命相；不过一个人倒霉成这样，你还期望他能温柔和蔼，那也太不现实了。","Merlin’s stock was flat.The king wanted to stop his wages; he even wanted to banish him, but I interfered.I said he would be useful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that, and I would give him a lift now and then when his poor little parlormagic soured on him.There wasn’t a rag of his tower left, but I had the government rebuild it for him, and advised him to take boarders; but he was too hightoned for that.And as for being grateful, he never even said thank you.He was a rather hard lot, take him how you might; but then you couldn’t fairly expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so."
"第八章　头子","CHAPTER 8 The Boss"
"大权在握是件好事，不过要是旁观的世人都对此毫无异议那就更妙了。塔楼事件巩固了我的权力，使它更不可动摇了。若说之前还有人嫉妒我，对我挑三拣四的话，现如今他们可都改变心意了。举国上下，没有任何人认为干涉我的事情是什么明智之举。","TO be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing; but to have the on-looking world consent to it is a finer.The tower episode solidified my power, and made it impregnable.If any were perchance disposed to be jealous and critical before that, they experienced a change of heart, now.There was not any one in the kingdom who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters."
"我很快就适应了我的地位和环境。有段时间，我早上醒来，为自己的“梦”而微微一笑，听听科尔特工厂的汽笛响了没有；不过这种事情慢慢地就淡化了，最后我彻底认识到我真的是生活在六世纪，生活在亚瑟王的朝廷里，而不是在疯人院。从此，我就变得非常自在了，换个其他世纪也不过如此；要说有什么偏好的话，我可不会拿它去换二十世纪。你瞧，一位集知识、智慧、勇气和抱负于一身的人，能和这个国家一起扬帆远航，一起成长，那该是多好的机会啊。这是前所未有的最为广阔的天地，而且都为我所有，没有一个竞争者；在我面前比学识比能力人人都是娃娃级的；反过来，在二十世纪我能有什么出息？我也就能在工厂里当个工头罢了，仅此而已；无论哪天，拖个渔网在大街上随便一拉，就能逮到一百个比我强的人。","I was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances.For a time, I used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my “dream,” and listen for the Colt’s factory whistle; but that sort of thing played itself out, gradually, and at last I was fully able to realize that I was actually living in the sixth century, and in Arthur’s court, not a lunatic asylum.After that, I was just as much at home in that century as I could have been in any other; and as for preference, I wouldn’t have traded it for the twentieth.Look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains, pluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country.The grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor; not a man who wasn’t a baby to me in acquirements and capacities; whereas, what would I amount to in the twentieth century?I should be foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seine down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself."
"我这不是平步青云么！我没法儿不去想，不去琢磨这件事，就跟一个人挖出了石油似的。在我之前，没有一个人能望其项背，除了约瑟夫以外；就是约瑟夫，也只能算勉强接近，并不能并驾齐驱。因为从道理上来讲，约瑟夫那无以伦比的理财天赋只给国王一人带来好处，公众一定对他颇为不满，而我则造福百姓，保全了太阳，为此深得民心。","What a jump I had made!I couldn’t keep from thinking about it, and contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil. There was nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might be Joseph’s case; and Joseph’s only approached it, it didn’t equal it, quite.For it stands to reason that as Joseph’s splendid financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king, the general public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas I had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was popular by reason of it."
"我不是国王的影子，我是实实在在的国王，国王本人才是影子。我真可以说是大权在握，而且不是通常那种徒有虚名的，而是名副其实的权力。我正站在世界史上第二伟大时期的发源地，看到涓涓历史之流渐渐汇聚在一起，渐深渐广，汇成强大的激流奔向未来世纪；而且我还记下了在历代君王的庇护之下，不断涌现出来的许多像我这样的冒险家：德·蒙特福特，盖维斯通，莫蒂默，维利尔斯，还有法国那几位制造战争并指挥战役的荡妇，还有查理二世那几个篡权乱政的淫妇，而这些人跟我比起来，没有一位不相形见绌的。我是独一无二的，而且让人开心的是，毫无疑问，要过一千三百年这个事实才能被人推翻或有人质疑。不错，就权力来说我等同于国王。与此同时还有一种权力，比我们俩的合在一起还稍稍大点。那就是教会。我没想掩盖这个事实。即使我想那么做，也办不到。不过目前还不必操心这个；以后，在适当的时机，它自然会出现的。起初它并没有给我带来任何麻烦——至少没造成任何严重的后果。","I was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king himself was the shadow.My power was colossal; and it was not a mere name, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine article.I stood here, at the very spring and source of the second great period of the world’s history; and could see the trickling stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden, and roll its mighty tides down the far centuries; and I could note the upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long array of thrones: De Montforts, Gavestons, Mortimers, Villierses; the war-making, campaign-directing wantons of France, and Charles the Second’s scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in the procession was my fullsized fellow visible.I was a Unique; and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half, for sure.Yes, in power I was equal to the king.At the same time there was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put together.That was the Church.I do not wish to disguise that fact.I couldn’t, if I wanted to.But never mind about that, now; it will show up, in its proper place, later on. It didn’t cause me any trouble in the beginning—at least any of consequence."
"哈，这真是个怪异的国家，也很有趣。还有这儿的人民！他们是最稀奇古怪、最心地单纯、最偏听轻信的种族；哼，他们就是一群兔子。真是太可怜了，作为生长在健康自由环境下的人来说，还得听他们卑躬屈膝而又满心真诚地倾诉对国王、教会和贵族的耿耿忠心；好像比起奴隶敬爱鞭子或狗儿敬爱踢它的陌生人，他们热爱敬仰国王和教会的理由要多一些似的。啊呀，老天，任何一种王权，无论怎样加以修饰，任何一种贵族，无论怎样约束，都是十足的对人的侮辱；可是，如果你是在这种制度里出生长大，也许你自己永远不会了解，而且别人告诉你你也绝不会相信。一想到这，足以让人为自己的种族羞惭不已，让一个废物占着王位，没有任何权力或者任何理由，而且那些第七流的人总是把自己奉为贵族——这群君主和贵族，通常说来，假如让他们自食其力，像那些比他们强的人那样，那他们就只能落得个一贫如洗，默默无闻。","Well, it was a curious country, and full of interest.And the people!They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race; why, they were nothing but rabbits.It was pitiful for a person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and Church and nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor king and Church and noble than a slave has to love and honor the lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him!Why, dear me, ANY kind of royalty, howsoever modified, ANY kind of aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself, and don’t believe it when somebody else tells you.It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people that have always figured as its aristocracies—a company of monarchs and nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions."
"亚瑟王统治下的大部分英国人民都是奴隶，纯粹是奴隶，别人也这么叫他们，脖子上还戴着铁圈；其余的实际上也是奴隶，不过没人这么称呼他们；他们自认为是人，是自由人，而且也这么称呼自己。事实是，整个民族在这个世界上活着是为了同一个目标，而且只为这一个目标：在国王、教会和贵族面前卑躬屈膝；做他们的奴隶，为他们流血流汗，忍饥挨饿，只为了他们能够吃饱，辛苦劳作，只为了他们能够尽情玩乐，自己吃尽苦头，只为了他们能够开心幸福，自己赤身露体，只为了能让他们可以遍身绫罗绸缎，穿金戴银，自己缴纳赋税，只为了让他们不用破费，一辈子阿谀奉承，奴颜卑膝，只为了让他们可以趾高气扬，当自己是这个世界的神灵。尽管如此，他们得到的感谢却是打骂和白眼；而他们还如此没有志气，甚至把这种待遇当成荣幸。","The most of King Arthur’s British nation were slaves, pure and simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their necks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name; they imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselves so.The truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for one object, and one only: to grovel before king and Church and noble; to slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs that they might be happy, go naked that they might wear silks and jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them, be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves the gods of this world.And for all this, the thanks they got were cuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor."
"从祖辈继承的观念是很稀奇古怪的东西，观察研究起来很有意思。我有我这样的观念，国王和他的子民也有他们的。无论是哪方，那些观念日积月累，习惯成自然，会变得越来越根深蒂固，而谁要打算通过说理辩论来改变他们，那他手头上可得准备一份长长的清单了。比如说，所有人秉承了这样的观念，但凡没有头衔、没有长长的家谱的人，无论有没有了不起的天赋或成就，都只不过被看成像是不足挂齿的生物，像许许多多的动物或者昆虫一样；然而我秉承的观念却是，那些像寒鸦的人，他们甘心将世袭的爵位和不劳而获的头衔当做孔雀的翎羽来装饰自己，这样的人才毫不足取，该成为笑柄。大家看我的眼神是奇怪的，不过这也很自然。你知道管理员和公众是如何看动物园里的大象的吧，是的，就是那样。他们对它庞大的身躯和惊人的力量艳羡不已；他们总是得意洋洋地提起这样的事实，它能做一百种远远超出自己能力的惊人之举；他们还同样得意地说，它一旦发起怒来，能撵着一千人跑。但是这样它就能成为他们当中的一员了吗？不会的，即使连坐在最后排，衣衫最破烂不堪的流浪汉都会笑话这个想法的。他是无法理解、无法接受的，甚至无论如何连想也不会想到的。不错，对于国王、贵族，对于全国人民，直至奴隶和流浪汉，我就是那样一只大象，别无二致。大家对我是既羡慕又害怕，但就像羡慕和害怕一只动物一样。动物是不会被尊崇的，我也一样，甚至连受尊重也谈不上。我没有家世，没有世袭的头衔，所以在国王和那些贵族眼里我只不过是一粒尘埃；平民看我时心怀好奇与恐惧，但其中绝对不带一点敬意。由于继承而来的观念力量强大，他们无法想象除了家世和贵族的身份以外还有什么值得尊崇的。从这儿你可以看到罗马天主教会那股可怕的势力。短短的二三百年时间它就将一整国的人变成了一整国的蠕虫。在教会获得世间至高无上的权力之前，人还是人，高昂着头颅，心怀作为人应有的自豪、气魄和独立品格，而一个人无论取得怎样的丰功伟业和地位，主要都是凭借成就，而不是凭借出身。可接下来教会占据了重要地位，还居心叵测；教会非常聪明狡猾，无论是剥猫的皮还是人民的皮都知道不止一种方法；它发明了“君权神授”，还一步步地用耶稣的“福音”到处支持这个说法——歪曲了其中的善良动机，利用它来构筑一个邪恶的目的；它宣扬（对平民宣扬）要谦卑恭谨，服从尊长，自我牺牲的美德；它宣扬（对平民宣扬）受了凌辱也要温柔和顺，宣扬（还是对平民宣扬，总是对平民）忍耐，自我贬低，面对压迫也不要抵抗；它还引入了世袭爵位和贵族头衔，还教导全世界的基督教徒对之顶礼膜拜。甚至到了我出生的那个世纪，这种流毒还存在于基督徒的血液里，而且即使是英国最优秀的平民也都情愿看到比自己差劲的人厚颜无耻地继续占据着许多职位，诸如贵族、君主等等，因为本国稀奇古怪的法律不容他有非分之想；事实上，他不仅对此等怪现状毫无疑义，甚至能说服自己对此引以为豪。这似乎可以说明，世界上没有你忍受不了的事情，只要你生于斯长于斯。当然这种毛病，这种崇拜身份头衔的毛病，也曾存在于我们美国人的血液里——这我明白；不过当我离开美国时它已经消失了——至少从重要方面是看不到了。那点病根仅仅在那些纨绔公子小姐身上才找得到。当病症减退到那种程度，就尽可以说是不足为虑了。","Inherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observe and examine.I had mine, the king and his people had theirs.In both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit, and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument would have had a long contract on his hands.For instance, those people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or hadn’t, were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams of inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good but to be laughed at.The way I was looked upon was odd, but it was natural.You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie: well, that is the idea.They are full of admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; they speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him.But does that make him one of THEM?No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at the idea.He couldn’t comprehend it; couldn’t take it in; couldn’t in any remote way conceive of it.Well, to the king, the nobles, and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was just that kind of an elephant, and nothing more.I was admired, also feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared.The animal is not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even respected.I had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king’s and nobles’ eyes I was mere dirt; the people regarded me with wonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship.There you see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic Church.In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms.Before the day of the Church’s supremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up, and had a man’s pride and spirit and independence; and what of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement, not by birth.But then the Church came to the front, with an axe to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way to skin a cat—or a nation; she invented “divine right of kings,” and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes—wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the commoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner, always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance under oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of the earth to bow down to them and worship them.Even down to my birth-century that poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors impudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as lordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it.It seems to show that there isn’t anything you can’t stand, if you are only born and bred to it.Of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been in our American blood, too—I know that; but when I left America it had disappeared—at least to all intents and purposes.The remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.When a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly be said to be out of the system."
"不过还是回过头来谈谈我在亚瑟王国里那不伦不类的地位吧。我就是这个样子，侏儒当中的巨人，孩子当中的大人，傻子当中的智者：用所有合情合理的标准衡量都是全英国独一无二、货真价实的伟大人物；然而，在那时那地，正如多年之后我出生时的英国一样，傻头傻脑的伯爵只要声称自己是哪个国王情人的几世几世子孙，即使那情人是国王从伦敦贫民窟里捡来的二手货，他也就比我强。这样的人物在亚瑟王国中是受到百般讨好、人人敬仰的，尽管他的性情像他的智力一样平庸，他的品德和他的血统一般低下。有的时候国王在场他能就座，而我就不可以。我本可以相当容易就搞个头衔，这样就能提高我在大家眼中的地位，甚至连国王，赐给我头衔的人，都会高看我一眼。但是我都没请求一下，而且要赐予我的时候我还谢绝了。依我的理念我是不会喜欢这种东西的；而且反正那也不是什么光明正大的事，因为就我追根溯源的结果显示，我们宗族从来没出过私生子。　我对于任何头衔都不会真正感到心满意足并引以为豪，得意洋洋，除非这个头衔是来自于全国人民这一唯一合法渠道；这才是我希望赢得的头衔；经过数年诚实光荣的努力，我真得到了它，而且顶着它还扬眉吐气，问心无愧呢。这个头衔是某天在某个村庄从某位铁匠嘴里偶然说出来的，大家一听都认为很不错，于是哈哈笑着口口相传，得到了一致肯定；不出十天这头衔就风靡全国，变得和国王的名字一样尽人皆知了。在此之后，我就只此一个头衔，不论是平民百姓拉家常，还是国王和群臣郑重其事地讨论国家大事，提起我都不用别的称呼了。这个头衔，要是翻译成现代语言，就是“我们的头子”。这是全国人民选出来的。它很适合我。并且这是个相当高贵的头衔。带“我们”的头衔实在不多，而我的就是其中之一。如果你提起公爵、伯爵、主教，谁知道你指的是哪一个？可是如果你提起“我们的国王”，“我们的王后”，或者“我们的头子”，那就不一样了。","But to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur’s kingdom.Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world; and yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my birth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent from a king’s leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of London, was a better man than I was.Such a personage was fawned upon in Arthur’s realm and reverently looked up to by everybody, even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence, and his morals as base as his lineage.There were times when HE could sit down in the king’s presence, but I couldn’t.I could have got a title easily enough, and that would have raised me a large step in everybody’s eyes; even in the king’s, the giver of it.But I didn’t ask for it; and I declined it when it was offered.I couldn’t have enjoyed such a thing with my notions; and it wouldn’t have been fair, anyway, because as far back as I could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister.I couldn’t have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation itself, the only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win; and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride.This title fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village, was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had swept the kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king’s name.I was never known by any other designation afterward, whether in the nation’s talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the council-board of the sovereign.This title, translated into modern speech, would be THE BOSS.Elected by the nation.That suited me.And it was a pretty high title.There were very few THE’S, and I was one of them.If you spoke of the duke, or the earl, or the bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant?But if you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was different."
"不错，我很喜欢国王，他身为一国之君，我还很尊重他——尊重他的职位，至少和我尊重其他不劳而获的至高权位一样尊重；不过将他当作人来看，我鄙视他和他的那些贵族——当然是私下里。他和他那些贵族也喜欢我，很尊重我的职务；不过将我当作一只动物，没有家世或者虚假头衔，他们看不起我——当然并不刻意掩饰。我对他们的意见都是免费赠送，他们对我的意见也是分文不取：账目两清，收支平衡，皆大欢喜。","Well, I liked the king, and as king I respected him—respected the office; at least respected it as much as I was capable of respecting any unearned supremacy; but as MEN I looked down upon him and his nobles—privately.And he and they liked me, and respected my office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title, they looked down upon me—and were not particularly private about it, either.I didn’t charge for my opinion about them, and they didn’t charge for their opinion about me: the account was square, the books balanced, everybody was satisfied."
"第九章　比武大会","CHAPTER 9 The Tournament"
"他们总在卡米洛那个地方举行盛大的比武大会；那些以人充牛的斗牛比赛热闹非凡，有趣而又滑稽可笑，不过在一个务实的人看来，未免有点无聊。尽管如此，我一般都在场，为了两个原因：一个人要是想讨别人喜欢，就不能对自己的朋友和周围人心爱的东西避而远之——尤其是作为一个政客；并且身为生意人和政客，我想要研究一下这比武大会，看看我是否能把它改进改进。这让我想到，有件事要顺便提一下，在任期内我做的第一项政绩——也是在我上任的头一天——就是创办一个专利局；因为我明白一个国家要是没有专利局和良好的专利法，就会像是一只螃蟹，哪里也去不了，除了往旁边走或者向后退。","THEY were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot; and very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights they were, too, but just a little wearisome to the practical mind.However, I was generally on hand—for two reasons: a man must not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he would be liked—especially as a statesman; and both as business man and statesman I wanted to study the tournament and see if I couldn’t invent an improvement on it.That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first official thing I did, in my administration—and it was on the very first day of it, too—was to start a patent office; for I knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab, and couldn’t travel any way but sideways or backways."
"事情一如既往，几乎每周都有比武大会；而且时不时的小伙子们还要我也参加——我说的是兰斯洛特爵士那些人——不过我说以后我慢慢会参加的，先不用着急，这庞大的国家还有待加油添料，调整之后方可运转。","Things ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then the boys used to want me to take a hand—I mean Sir Launcelot and the rest—but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going."
"其中一届比武大会每天都进行，一直持续了一个多星期，从头到尾有多达五百名骑士参加。他们要好几周才能聚齐。他们是从四面八方骑马赶来的，有的来自边远地区，有的甚至来自海外；许多人还携女士们同行，大家全都带着侍从和成群的奴仆。这大队人马衣着华美艳丽，真正是那个国家和那个时代的特色，情绪高昂犹如动物撒欢儿，言谈粗鄙无知，放荡不羁，毫无道德廉耻。每天从早到晚，不是比武，就是看别人比武；每天晚上都要唱歌、赌钱、跳舞，狂欢作乐到深更半夜。他们过得真是无比逍遥快活。你肯定从来没见过这样的人。那一排排美丽的女士们，浓妆艳抹犹如野蛮人，艳光四射；看着竞技场里的骑士被像你脚踝那么粗的长矛杆扎了个穿心透，鲜血直喷，滚下马来，她们绝不会晕倒，反倒鼓掌喝彩，推来搡去以便看得更真切些；只是时而有个把女士会把脸埋在手绢里，招摇地做出一副肝肠寸断的样子，此时你可以放心跟人打赌，二赔一，这里面准有段风流韵事，而她唯恐大家还没有发现。","We had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part in it, from first to last.They were weeks gathering.They came on horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country, and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and all brought squires and troops of servants.It was a most gaudy and gorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and very characteristic of the country and the time, in the way of high animal spirits, innocent indecencies of language, and happy-hearted indifference to morals.It was fight or look on, all day and every day; and sing, gamble, dance, carouse half the night every night.They had a most noble good time.You never saw such people.Those banks of beautiful ladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a knight sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a better view; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief, and look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public hadn’t found it out."
"要是平时，夜里那些噪音准会让我觉得讨厌，可是在目前的情况下我却不怎么介意，因为它使我听不到那些江湖郎中把白天受伤的人胳膊腿儿卸下来的声音了。他们弄坏了我那把特别好使而且用了多年的大锯，还把锯架也给弄断了，不过我也懒得计较。至于我那柄斧头——哼，我可是下定决心了，下次我要再借斧头给外科医生，我可得挑我的世纪。","The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, but I didn’t mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day’s cripples.They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me, and broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass.And as for my axe—well, I made up my mind that the next time I lent an axe to a surgeon I would pick my century."
"我不仅天天看比武大会，还从我那公众道德与农业部派了一位足智多谋的神父，命令他将所见所闻一一写成报道；因为我有个打算，慢慢的等我将全国人民的知识水平提高到一定程度，就办份报纸。在一个新的国度里，你想要的头一件东西就是专利局；其次是一步步建立你的学校体制；而后，就是出你的报纸。报纸当然有报纸的毛病，而且还不少，不过不要紧，它可是能把一个死气沉沉的国家从坟墓里唤醒的，这你可别忘了。没有报纸是做不到这一点的，除此之外别无他法。所以我想取些样品，好在需要新闻的时候，能够弄清楚自己从六世纪能搜寻出什么样的报道材料来。","I not only watched this tournament from day to day, but detailed an intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and Agriculture, and ordered him to report it; for it was my purpose by and by, when I should have gotten the people along far enough, to start a newspaper.The first thing you want in a new country, is a patent office; then work up your school system; and after that, out with your paper.A newspaper has its faults, and plenty of them, but no matter, it’s hark from the tomb for a dead nation, and don’t you forget it.You can’t resurrect a dead nation without it; there isn’t any way. So I wanted to sample things, and be finding out what sort of reportermaterial I might be able to rake together out of the sixth century when I should come to need it."
"平心而论，这位神父干得相当不错。他搞来了所有的细节，这在地方新闻里可是很不错的事情：你瞧，他年纪尚轻时曾在教堂殡仪部管过账，那里，你知道，钱款名目繁多；名目越多，油水越多：杠夫，雇来送丧的，蜡烛，祈祷——每样都要花钱；而如果丧家付的祷告费不够多，你可以用双叉铅笔记蜡烛账，而你的账单看起来还会毫无问题。而且他还有手绝活，能东拉西扯想办法去恭维一位有可能来登广告的骑士——不对，我是说一位有影响的骑士；他还极具天赋善于夸大其词，因为他在年轻时曾给一位虔诚的隐士看过门，那位隐士身居腌臜之地，却能屡显神迹。","Well, the priest did very well, considering.He got in all the details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see, he had kept books for the undertaker department of his church when he was younger, and there, you know, the money’s in the details; the more details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers—everything counts; and if the bereaved don’t buy prayers enough you mark up your candles with a forked pencil, and your bill shows up all right.And he had a good knack at getting in the complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely to advertise—no, I mean a knight that had influence; and he also had a neat gift of exaggeration, for in his time he had kept door for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles."
"当然，这位新手的报告声势不足，缺少令人毛骨悚然的描写，因此还不够地道；不过那古雅的措辞倒是蛮有趣，可爱又质朴，弥漫着那个时代的气息，这些小小的优点也算在一定程度上弥补了那些重大的缺憾。这是从中节选的一段：","Of course this novice’s report lacked whoop and crash and lurid description, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique wording was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances and flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure for its more important lacks.Here is an extract from it:"
"随后两位城堡骑士，群岛的布赖恩爵士和格拉默·格拉默萨姆爵士，迎战阿格洛瓦爵士和托尔爵士，托尔爵士将格拉默·格拉默萨姆爵士重重一击，打倒在地。随之而来的是城堡骑士忧伤塔楼的卡拉多斯爵士和蒂尔坎爵士，他们在那里迎战两兄弟加利的珀西瓦尔爵士和加利的拉莫拉克爵士；珀西瓦尔爵士与卡拉多斯爵士刚一过招，手中长矛便双双折断；蒂尔坎爵士和拉莫拉克爵士交手，两人都被连人带马撅翻在地，双方又将对手救起，扶上马来再战。而城堡骑士阿诺德爵士和高特爵士则与布兰德莱斯爵士和凯爵士交战，四位爵士大战一场，手中长矛纷纷折断。后来佩托洛普爵士也从城堡赶来，和莱昂内尔爵士展开激战，佩托洛普爵士这位绿骑士将莱昂内尔爵士，兰斯洛特之手足，撅下马来。所有这些，谁表现最佳，姓甚名谁，都被御前传令官一一记下。接着布里奥巴瑞斯爵士手执长矛直刺加雷思爵士，然而一击之下布里奥巴瑞斯爵士自己却翻身坠地。加里霍定爵士见此情形，高声向加里思爵士挑战，而加里思爵士也将他打翻在地。加里胡德爵士挺枪上前为弟报仇，加雷思爵士也同样将其撅翻在地，丁纳丹爵士与其兄弟拉科特·马勒·泰勒、热心的萨格拉默爵士、野蛮的多迪纳斯爵士，都被他的一支长矛一一摆平。爱尔兰国王阿斯威萨斯一见之下，大为吃惊，加里思爵士武艺如此高强，变幻莫测，一忽儿似乎是绿色的，一忽儿冲出来仿佛又变成了蓝色。由此每个回合他驰来往去都要变换颜色，直教得国王与骑士们无法辨认。随后爱尔兰国王阿斯威萨斯爵士与加里思爵士展开鏖战，被加里思爵士连人带马鞍击落在地。苏格兰的卡拉多斯国王也随即杀来，被加里思爵士杀得人仰马翻。戈尔国王于里安斯也同样被他打翻在地。随后出战的是巴吉马库斯爵士，加里思爵士也将他连人带马打倒在地。巴吉马库斯之子梅里加鲁斯豪气顿起，奋力挺起长矛朝加里思爵士杀来，长矛折为两段。贵为亲王的加拉赫特爵士当即振声高呼道：“颜色变幻多端的骑士啊，阁下端的是武艺高强；且稍待片刻，我来会会阁下。”加里思爵士一听此言，挺起手中巨矛，二人战作一团，亲王的长矛折为两段；却说加里思爵士朝他头盔左侧击来，打得他左摇右晃，若不是手下出手相救早已滚下马来。“果真，”亚瑟王说道，“这位颜色多变之骑士果真非同凡响！”因此国王召兰斯洛特爵士上前，恳请他迎战那位骑士。“陛下，”兰斯洛特言道，“臣满心以为此时当放他一马，今日他已苦战多时，在一位出色的骑士大展身手之际，任他取得应得荣誉乃优秀骑士之本分，也就是，当他眼见一位骑士如此辛苦劳顿之后。”“或许，”兰斯洛特接着说，“今日他厮杀于此 ，恐怕芸芸众骑士中这位夫人独钟情于他，微臣深省此君不辞劳苦，硬是要取得丰功伟业，因此，”兰斯洛特爵士顿道，“臣以为，今日荣誉理当归于此君；臣虽能凭己之力阻挠其功，然非臣之所愿也。”","Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum, knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale and Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummorsum to the earth.Then came Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle, and there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren, and there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other, horse and all, to the earth, and either parties rescued other and horsed them again.And Sir Arnold, and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four knights encountered mightily, and brake their spears to their hands.Then came Sir Pertolope from the castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel, and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot.All this was marked by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth.When Sir Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him, and Sir Gareth smote him to the earth.Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and Sir Dodinas le Savage; all these he bare down with one spear.When King Aswisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time seemed green, and another time, at his again coming, he seemed blue.And thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his color, so that there might neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from his horse, saddle and all.And then came King Carados of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man.And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the land of Gore.And then there came in Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man to the earth.And Bagdemagus’s son Meliganus brake a spear upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly.And then Sir Galahault the noble prince cried on high, Knight with the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee ready that I may just with thee.Sir Gareth heard him, and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir Gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not his men recovered him.Truly, said King Arthur, that knight with the many colors is a good knight.Wherefore the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and prayed him to encounter with that knight.Sir, said Launcelot, I may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is no good knight’s part to let him of his worship, and, namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be here, for I see well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he shall have the honour; though it lay in my power to put him from it, I would not."
"那天发生了点不愉快的小插曲，鉴于种种重要原因，我把它从神父的报告里删掉了。你一定注意到了，加里在这次比赛中真所谓战绩斐然。我口中的加里，指的是加里思爵士。加里是我私下里对他的昵称；这表明我对他情深意重，事实正是如此。不过这仅仅是私下里叫的昵称，从来没有大声对谁喊出来，更不要提当着他的面了；他身为贵族肯定不能容忍像我这样的人对他这样没大没小。好了，言归正传：作为国王的重臣，我坐在单单为我而设的私人包厢里。而丁纳丹爵士，在等着进比武场的当儿，走了进来，往那儿一坐，就开始讲了起来。他总是跟我套近乎，因为我是新来的，而他喜欢为他的笑话开拓新的市场，那些笑话早已老掉牙了，只有讲故事的人自己笑来笑去，听故事的人都露出厌倦的表情。我总是尽量对他的努力有所回应，对他个人也抱有真真切切的深情厚谊，原因在于，我一生当中听得最频繁、最最憎恨厌恶的那个笑话，即使老天满怀恶毒让他知道了，他至少没对我讲过。那个笑话，只要是踏上了美国国土的有点幽默感的人，从哥伦布到阿蒂默斯·沃德，我都听到人家把它归功于自己。那笑话讲的是，一个幽默的演说家对着一群愚昧无知的听众滔滔不绝地讲了一个小时最能笑死人的笑话，自始至终却没人发笑；后来等他要走的时候，几个头发花白的老傻瓜却拉住他的手感激涕零地说这是他们听过的最有趣的笑话了，“要不是他们都憋住了，大家早就在会场里笑出来了。”　　那个笑话搁在什么时候也不值得一提，可是我却坐在那里听人家讲了上百遍，上千遍，上百万遍，上亿遍了，每次我都从头到尾嚷个不停，骂个没完。能指望谁来明白我的感受呢，又听这个满身铠甲的蠢驴重新讲一遍，在这沉沉暮色般的传统下，在历史黎明到来之前，在即使是提起拉克坦修斯都要称之为“最近去世的拉克坦修斯，”而十字军还要五百年才能出世的时刻呢？他刚刚讲完，唤他上场的人就到了，于是，他一边哈哈笑着，跟个魔鬼似的，一边叮叮当当地像一筐破铜烂铁似的往外走，其余的我就什么都不知道了。过了几分钟我才醒过来，睁眼睁得正是时候，正好看到加里思爵士狠狠地给了他一下，我下意识地祈祷起来：“但愿老天让他死了算了！”但我运气太差，话还没说到一半，加里思爵士就朝快乐的萨格拉摩爵士扑了过去，把他从马屁股上轰隆一声掀了下来，萨格拉摩爵士正好听到了我的话，以为我说的是他呢。","There was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons of state I struck out of my priest’s report.You will have noticed that Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.When I say Garry I mean Sir Gareth.Garry was my private pet name for him; it suggests that I had a deep affection for him, and that was the case.But it was a private pet name only, and never spoken aloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not have endured a familiarity like that from me.Well, to proceed: I sat in the private box set apart for me as the king’s minister.While Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists, he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was always making up to me, because I was a stranger and he liked to have a fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while the other person looks sick.I had always responded to his efforts as well as I could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him, too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me.It was one which I had heard attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on American soil, from Columbus down to Artemus Ward.It was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; and then when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever heard, and “it was all they could do to keep from laughin’ right out in meetin’.”  That anecdote never saw the day that it was worth the telling; and yet i had sat under the telling of it hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times, and cried and cursed all the way through. Then who can hope to know what my feelings were, to hear this armorplated ass start in on it again, in the murky twilight of tradition, before the dawn of history, while even Lactantius might be referred to as “the late Lactantius,” and the Crusades wouldn’t be born for five hundred years yet?Just as he finished, the call-boy came; so, haw-hawing like a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of loose castings, and I knew nothing more.It was some minutes before I came to, and then I opened my eyes just in time to see Sir Gareth fetch him an awful welt, and I unconsciously out with the prayer, “I hope to gracious he’s killed!” But by ill-luck, before I had got half through with the words, Sir Gareth crashed into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over his horse’s crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought I meant it for HIM."
"唉，无论什么时候，一旦有件事钻进了这帮人的脑子，那是无论如何也拔不出来了。我深知这一点，所以省了番口舌，没做任何解释。萨格拉摩爵士刚养好了伤，就通知我说我们俩之间有点小账要算，他还指定了三四年后的某个日子，地点也定了，就在我冒犯他的那个比武场。我说等他回来了我随时奉陪。你瞧，他正要去寻找圣杯呢。这些小伙子时不时的就要出去碰碰运气，寻找圣杯。一去可就是好几年。他们每次出去这么久，都是探头探脑四处乱转，十分卖力的样子，尽管没有一个人知道圣杯到底在哪里，而且我也认为他们压根儿就没指望能找到，或者碰巧找到了也不知道该拿它做什么。你瞧，那就是当时的西北航道，你可以这么说，就是这么回事。年年都有人长途跋涉去寻找圣杯，来年又有新增的远征队伍出去寻找他们。这事能让人名扬四海，但发财就没指望了。啊哈，他们还真想让我也卷进去呢！哼，我一笑置之。","Well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head, there was no getting it out again.I knew that, so I saved my breath, and offered no explanations.As soon as Sir Sagramor got well, he notified me that there was a little account to settle between us, and he named a day three or four years in the future; place of settlement, the lists where the offense had been given.I said I would be ready when he got back.You see, he was going for the Holy Grail.The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then.It was a several years’ cruise.They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don’t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he HAD run across it.You see, it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may say; that was all.Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for THEM.There was worlds of reputation in it, but no money.Why, they actually wanted ME to put in!Well, I should smile."
"第十章　文明的起始","CHAPTER 10 Beginnings of Civilization"
"很快挑战的消息就传到了“圆桌”那里，当然也激起了热烈的讨论，因为那群小子们对这类事情是相当感兴趣的。国王认为我如今该动身去历险了，这样我才可能扬名立万，才能更有资格在几年之后与萨格拉摩爵士交手。眼下我还是推脱了，我说我还得花三四年时间把事情都搞定，让一切顺利进行下去；到那时我随时可以出发；很可能三四年后萨格拉摩爵士还在外面寻找圣杯，所以往后推一下也不会浪费什么宝贵时光；那时我应该任职六七年了，我建立的系统机制应该已经运行顺利，我休几天假也不会有什么妨碍的。","THE Round Table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it was a good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys.The king thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures, so that I might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet Sir Sagramor when the several years should have rolled away.I excused myself for the present; I said it would take me three or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly; then I should be ready; all the chances were that at the end of that time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing, so no valuable time would be lost by the postponement; I should then have been in office six or seven years, and I believed my system and machinery would be so well developed that I could take a holiday without its working any harm."
"对于目前我已经取得的成就我十分满意。在许多偏远僻静的地方我已经为各类实业奠定了基础——未来大工厂的核心，我那未来文明的钢铁使者。在这些地方汇聚了我所能网罗到的最聪明的年轻人，而且我还一直派专人到全国各地去物色更多的人才。我正在将一群无知民众训练成行家——各种手艺活和科学技术的行家。我这些培养工作平稳而隐秘地进行着，在那些穷乡僻壤没人打扰，因为没有特别批准，不允许任何人进入那些区域——我怕的是教会。","I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished.In various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all sorts of industries under way—nuclei of future vast factories, the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization.In these were gathered together the brightest young minds I could find, and I kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time.I was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts—experts in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.These nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without a special permit—for I was afraid of the Church."
"我首先开办了一所教师培训厂和许多所主日学校；因此，现在在那些地方我拥有了体系卓越的各级学校，开得热热闹闹，还有一整套新教礼拜会，欣欣向荣，蒸蒸日上。人人都可以想当哪种基督教徒就当哪种，在这件事情上大家都是完全自由的。不过我只限于让教会和主日学校向公众传授宗教，其余那些教育机构都不允许。我本可以优先照顾一下我那一派，毫不费力就能把大家都变成长老会教徒，不过那样一来就有违人类的天性了：人类在精神层面的需要和本能，跟人类肉体的欲望、肤色和五官长相一样，各不相同；一个人要展现道德的最佳风貌，唯有配以合适的宗教外衣，它的颜色、外形和型号最为巧妙地与穿着者精神上的肤色、体型、个头相匹配；此外，我还对统一的教会心怀恐惧，它能衍生强大的权力，想要多大就有多大，而随后它就会渐渐落入自私自利的人手中，这是必然的，到那个时候就意味着人类自由要灭亡，人类思想要瘫痪了。","I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sundayschools the first thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded schools in full blast in those places, and also a complete variety of Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition.Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted to; there was perfect freedom in that matter.But I confined public religious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting nothing of it in my other educational buildings.I could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian without any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion, angularities, and stature of the individual who wears it; and, besides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power, the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought."
"所有的矿藏都是王室产业，为数还不少。以前这些矿山都是用野蛮人采矿的方法进行的——在地上打些洞，矿石装在牛皮袋子里用手提上来，一天能产一吨；但我却尽早地采用科学的方法采矿了。","All mines were royal property, and there were a good many of them.They had formerly been worked as savages always work mines—holes grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand, at the rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put the mining on a scientific basis as early as I could."
"不错，当萨格拉摩爵士忽然向我提出挑战的时候，我已经取得了相当可观的进展了。","Yes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor’s challenge struck me."
"四年一晃而过——到那时，哼！那情形你绝对想象不到。无尽的权力掌握在可靠的人手里是再完美不过了。只有天堂里的专制统治才是完全没有瑕疵的统治。人间的专制统治要想完美无缺，情形就要和天上一致，也就是说，专制君主必须是人类最完美的人物，而且还能长生不老。但是作为凡人，完美无缺的人也必定会死，将他的专制统治交到一个不完美的继承人手里；人世间的专制统治不仅仅是一种糟糕的统治，它简直就是糟糕得没法再糟糕的统治。","Four years rolled by—and then!Well, you would never imagine it in the world.Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands.The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government.An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government, if the conditions were the same, namely, the despot the perfectest individual of the human race, and his lease of life perpetual.But as a perishable perfect man must die, and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor, an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government, it is the worst form that is possible."
"我的政绩表明了一个独裁者在掌握了一国资源之后会取得怎样的成就。丝毫没有引起这个黑暗国度的怀疑，我竟然让十九世纪的文明在它的鼻子底下繁荣起来了！虽然被从公众视线下遮挡了起来，不过它就在那儿，作为顶天立地不容质疑的事实——并且早晚会被世人所知，如果我还活着，运气还不坏的话。它就在那儿，千真万确，实实在在，就好像沉睡的火山，无辜地矗立在那儿，没有冒烟的顶峰直入蓝天，完全没有迹象显示它的肚子里正酝酿着地狱之火。四年前，我那些学校和教会还都是孩子，如今它们都长大了，当年的作坊也变成了大型工厂；当年我拥有十几个受过训练的人的地方，如今有一千人了；当年只有一位行家的地方，如今达到五十位了。可以说，我站在那儿，手放在龙头上，准备随时启动，用光明照亮那还处于黑夜的世界。不过我不打算搞得这么突然。　这不是我的策略。人们会承受不了，再说，已成为国教的罗马天主教会该马上报复我了。","My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a kingdom at his command.Unsuspected by this dark land, I had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose!It was fenced away from the public view, but there it was, a gigantic and unassailable fact—and to be heard from, yet, if I lived and had luck.There it was, as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels.My schools and churches were children four years before; they were grown-up now; my shops of that day were vast factories now; where I had a dozen trained men then, I had a thousand now; where I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty now.I stood with my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and flood the midnight world with light at any moment.But I was not going to do the thing in that sudden way. 　It was not my policy.The people could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have had the Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute."
"不行，我一直以来都很小心谨慎。我时不时地派心腹潜入全国各地，任务是在不让人觉察的情况下破坏骑士地位，并且一点点地消除别的迷信，这样一来就可以逐步为建立更好的社会秩序铺平道路。我每次释放的光明就犹如一支烛火那么大，而且打算继续这样做下去。","No, I had been going cautiously all the while.I had had confidential agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw a little at this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things.I was turning on my light one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so."
"我将几所分校秘密散布到全国各地，运转得相当不错。如果不发生什么让我恐惧的事情，随着时间的流逝，我打算将这桩生意继续做下去。我隐藏最深的秘密之一就是我的西点——我的军事学校。我精心地将它掩藏了起来，不让别人看见；在边远的海港我还建了一所海军学校，也同样隐蔽得很好。两处学校都越来越兴旺，令我十分满意。","I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom, and they were doing very well.I meant to work this racket more and more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me. One of my deepest secrets was my West Point—my military academy.I kept that most jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my naval academy which I had established at a remote seaport.Both were prospering to my satisfaction."
"如今克拉伦斯二十二岁了，是我手下位置最高的管理人员，我的左膀右臂。他可真是个宝贝，干什么都能胜任，这世上就没有他干不了的事。最近我正在着手对他进行新闻方面的训练，因为创办报纸似乎正是时候。不用太大，小小的周刊足矣，在我那些文明培养所里试发行一下。他干这个简直如鱼得水，没错，他天生就是个干编辑的料。他已经是一身二用了，说六世纪的话，写十九世纪的文章。他写新闻报道的文风正稳步提升，已经赶上阿拉巴马州那种落后地区的标准了，无论从内容上还是从品味上都与那个地方的主编大作毫无二致。","Clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right hand.He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn’t anything he couldn’t turn his hand to.Of late I had been training him for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start in the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for experimental circulation in my civilization nurseries.He took to it like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure.Already he had doubled himself in one way; he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth.His journalistic style was climbing, steadily; it was already up to the back settlement Alabama mark, and couldn’t be told from the editorial output of that region either by matter or flavor."
"我们手头上还有一项大工程。那就是电报和电话，我们在这行当的第一次风险经营。这些线路还仅限于私人使用，不到时机成熟不能公开。我们派出一队人马，主要在夜间工作。他们正在铺设地下线路；我们不敢立杆子，怕招来太多查问。无论是电报还是电话，地下线路就够好了，因为我的电线都是用我自己发明的方法绝缘的，万无一失。我命令手下人从乡村穿过去，避开大路，只要看到灯火闪烁，发现规模还算可以的城镇，就连接上电线，留下专业人士管理。无论你想到这个国家的哪个地方，都没有人能够告诉你该怎么走，因为谁都不会特意到哪个地方去，而是悠悠荡荡偶然走哪儿就是哪儿，离开的时候一般也不会想到问问那个地方的名字。我们还时不时派出地形勘探队，对全国的地形进行勘察，不过那些神父总是进行干涉，来找麻烦。因此我们暂时只好作罢；要跟教会对着干可不是明智之举。","We had another large departure on hand, too.This was a telegraph and a telephone; our first venture in this line.These wires were for private service only, as yet, and must be kept private until a riper day should come.We had a gang of men on the road, working mainly by night.They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid to put up poles, for they would attract too much inquiry.Ground wires were good enough, in both instances, for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect.My men had orders to strike across country, avoiding roads, and establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights betrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge.Nobody could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom, for nobody ever went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by accident in his wanderings, and then generally left it without thinking to inquire what its name was.At one time and another we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the kingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble.So we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor wisdom to antagonize the Church."
"至于国内的大体情况，基本上跟我刚来的时候一样。我是做了些变革，不过只是些必要的轻微变革，不会引人注意。目前为止，我甚至连税收问题都没干预过，除了为王室提供财政收入的那些税收以外。我对那些进行了系统整顿，使这项业务有效而又公平。由此，这些财政收入已经翻了四番了，而负担分摊却比从前还均衡，全国上下都感觉如释重负，对我的政绩也都由衷地赞叹。","As for the general condition of the country, it was as it had been when I arrived in it, to all intents and purposes.I had made changes, but they were necessarily slight, and they were not noticeable.Thus far, I had not even meddled with taxation, outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues.I had systematized those, and put the service on an effective and righteous basis.As a result, these revenues were already quadrupled, and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than before, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises of my administration were hearty and general."
"就个人而言，我现在碰到了点岔子，不过我可不放在心上，这时候来再好不过了。要是早点儿的话肯定会让我烦恼的，而现在一切掌握在可靠的人手里，进展也很顺利。国王后来几次三番提醒我，说我四年前请求宽限的日期如今已经快到了。这是暗示我该启程去寻求历险奇遇，博得盛名，好够得上与萨格拉摩爵士决斗的资格。他如今还在外面寻找圣杯，不过各路增派的远征军也正在找他，说不定哪年就把他找到了。所以你瞧，这次打岔正在意料之中，我并没有大吃一惊。","Personally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it, it could not have happened at a better time.Earlier it could have annoyed me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming right along.The king had reminded me several times, of late, that the postponement I had asked for, four years before, had about run out now.It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy of the honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor, who was still out grailing, but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions, and might be found any year, now.So you see I was expecting this interruption; it did not take me by surprise."
"第十一章　寻求冒险的美国人","CHAPTER 11 The Yankee in Search of Adventures"
"从来也没有哪个国家有这么多东游西荡的骗子，男女都有。没有哪个月不来几个这样的走江湖的，还都揣着一段传说，说某位公主什么的被一个无法无天的恶棍，通常是个巨人，抓去囚禁在遥远的城堡里，等待有人去解救。你一定会想，在听完素昧平生的人讲完这么一段拙劣的故事之后国王肯定会首先要他拿出点证明来——是呀，对城堡的位置略指一二啦，到城堡去的最佳路线啦，诸如此类。　可是这么简单的事情，很普通的常识，竟然都没人想到过。确实没有，所有人都把这些人的谎言囫囵吞了下去，从未提过任何问题。有一天，我正好不在，来了一个这样的人——这次是个女的——也按着老套路讲了这么一个故事。她那位女主人被囚禁在一个阴森森的大城堡里，同在一起的还有四十四位年轻貌美的女子，几乎都是公主；她们备受煎熬，在这残酷的囚禁中度过了二十六个春秋；城堡的主人是巨人三兄弟，都长着四只胳膊，一只眼睛——眼睛长在脑门正中央，像水果那么大。是什么样的水果她可没提；这班人在数据方面向来都是这样含含糊糊的。","THERE never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were of both sexes.Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant.Now you would think that the first thing the king would do after listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger, would be to ask for credentials—yes, and a pointer or two as to locality of castle, best route to it, and so on. 　But nobody ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing at that.No, everybody swallowed these people’s lies whole, and never asked a question of any sort or about anything.Well, one day when I was not around, one of these people came along—it was a she one, this time—and told a tale of the usual pattern.Her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other young and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses; they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six years; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers, each with four arms and one eye—the eye in the center of the forehead, and as big as a fruit.Sort of fruit not mentioned; their usual slovenliness in statistics."
"你能相信吗？国王和全体圆桌骑士一听到有这么个荒唐离奇的冒险机会，无不欣喜若狂。圆桌骑士个个都蹿起来抢这个机会，请求把这个机会赏给他们；然而让他们愤怒恼火的是，国王却把机会赏给了压根儿就没提出要求的我。","Would you believe it?The king and the whole Round Table were in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure.Every knight of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it; but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me, who had not asked for it at all."
"当克拉伦斯把这个消息告诉我的时候，我费了好大劲儿才没有喜形于色。而他——他可憋不住。他的嘴跟开了闸似的，滔滔不绝地讲着高兴和感激的话——高兴的是我时来运转，感激的是国王对我如此恩宠有加。他的腿和身子忍不住动来动去，用脚尖原地打着转，高兴得忘乎所以。","By an effort, I contained my joy when Clarence brought me the news.But he—he could not contain his.His mouth gushed delight and gratitude in a steady discharge—delight in my good fortune, gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me.He could keep neither his legs nor his body still, but pirouetted about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness."
"而我这方面，受到这样的恩宠，我倒是想对这好意一通咒骂呢，不过出于策略上的考虑，我还是压住了自己的恼怒，尽量装得高兴些。事实上，我声称自己很高兴。在某种程度上真是这样，一个人被剥了头皮的时候有多高兴，我就有多高兴。","On my side, I could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon me this benefaction, but I kept my vexation under the surface for policy’s sake, and did what I could to let on to be glad.Indeed, I SAID I was glad.And in a way it was true; I was as glad as a person is when he is scalped."
"是呀，人必须随遇而安，而不是把时间浪费在无济于事的苦恼上，应该着手干点正事，看看有什么补救措施。正如一堆麦糠中总能挑出几粒麦子，所有的谎言中总夹杂着几句真话；这回我非得挑出那几颗麦粒不可；于是我派人去请那位女士，她就来了。她长得相当标致，也很温柔端庄，不过，你要是示意她干点什么，她简直还不如一块女表明白呢。我说：","Well, one must make the best of things, and not waste time with useless fretting, but get down to business and see what can be done.In all lies there is wheat among the chaff; I must get at the wheat in this case: so I sent for the girl and she came.She was a comely enough creature, and soft and modest, but, if signs went for anything, she didn’t know as much as a lady’s watch.I said:"
"“亲爱的，有人问过你的详细情况没有啊？”","“My dear, have you been questioned as to particulars?”"
"她说没有。","She said she hadn’t."
"“哦，我早就料到没有了，不过我觉得我该问问，好放心；我打小就这样。现在你不要见怪，我要提醒你，因为我们不认识你，所以要慢慢来。当然你这个人也许没什么问题，我们也希望如此；不过做事可不能凭想当然。你应该明白这一点。我得问你几个问题；只要老老实实回答就行了，不用害怕。你在老家的时候住在哪儿？”","“Well, I didn’t expect you had, but I thought I would ask, to make sure; it’s the way I’ve been raised.Now you mustn’t take it unkindly if I remind you that as we don’t know you, we must go a little slow.You may be all right, of course, and we’ll hope that you are; but to take it for granted isn’t business.YOU understand that.I’m obliged to ask you a few questions; just answer up fair and square, and don’t be afraid.Where do you live, when you are at home?”"
"“在莫德，尊敬的阁下。”","“In the land of Moder, fair sir.”"
"“莫德。我不记得以前听说过这个地方。父母健在？”","“Land of Moder.I don’t remember hearing of it before.Parents living?”"
"“关于此事，奴家已被关在城堡多年，不知是否依然健在。”","“As to that, I know not if they be yet on live, sith it is many years that I have lain shut up in the castle.”"
"“请问你叫什么名字？”","“Your name, please?”"
"“回禀大人，奴家名叫阿丽桑德•拉卡特萝丝小姐。”","“I hight the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise, an it please you.”"
"“你认不认识这里的什么人能证明你的身份？”","“Do you know anybody here who can identify you?”"
"“这不大可能，尊敬的阁下，奴家可是初来乍到。”","“That were not likely, fair lord, I being come hither now for the first time.”"
"“那你带没带书信——任何凭证都成——有什么能证明你这人诚实可靠吗？”","“Have you brought any letters—any documents—any proofs that you are trustworthy and truthful?”"
"“真的不曾带，没带；我带那些干什么？”我是没带舌头吗，难道我自己不能说话吗？”","“Of a surety, no; and wherefore should I?Have I not a tongue, and cannot I say all that myself?”"
"“不过自己说的只有自己知道，这跟别人说的，是两回事。”","“But YOUR saying it, you know, and somebody else’s saying it, is different.”"
"“两回事？这从何说起？恐怕奴家难解其意。”","“Different?How might that be?I fear me I do not understand.”"
"“难解其意？那个——哎呀，你瞧——你瞧——哎呀，天呀，好家伙，你连这么点小事都不懂吗？难道你不明白这两回事的区别是——啊呀你怎么看起来这么天真、白痴啊！”","“Don’t UNDERSTAND?Land of—why, you see—you see—why, great Scott, can’t you understand a little thing like that?Can’t you understand the difference between your—WHY do you look so innocent and idiotic!”"
"“奴家？奴家确实不知，也许是上帝的旨意。”","“I?In truth I know not, but an it were the will of God.”"
"“是呀，是呀，我估摸也是那么回事。我有点激动，不要介意；我不是那意思。我们换个话题吧。现在说到城堡，里面有四十五位公主吧，还有三个吃人的妖怪管着，告诉我——这个后宫在什么地方？”","“Yes, yes, I reckon that’s about the size of it.Don’t mind my seeming excited; I’m not.Let us change the subject.Now as to this castle, with fortyfive princesses in it, and three ogres at the head of it, tell me—where is this harem?”"
"“后宫？”","“Harem?”"
"“这座城堡，你明白吧，城堡在哪儿？”","“The CASTLE, you understand; where is the castle?”"
"“哦，那个呀，城堡相当了得，高大雄伟，坚实牢固，而且远在异国他乡。是的，有无数里格之遥呢。”","“Oh, as to that, it is great, and strong, and well beseen, and lieth in a far country.Yes, it is many leagues.”"
"“多少里格？”","“HOW many?”"
"“啊呀，大人啊，真是累煞人也难说清啊，端的是无数里格，层叠交错，还都做成一个模样，涂成一个颜色，直教人难分彼此，无法数清，除非一一拆开，然此事得借上帝之力，非人力所为；大人您一去便知——”","“Ah, fair sir, it were woundily hard to tell, they are so many, and do so lap the one upon the other, and being made all in the same image and tincted with the same color, one may not know the one league from its fellow, nor how to count them except they be taken apart, and ye wit well it were God’s work to do that, being not within man’s capacity; for ye will note—”"
"“等等，等等，别管距离了，城堡到底在哪儿？从这儿往哪个方向走？”","“Hold on, hold on, never mind about the distance; WHEREABOUTS does the castle lie?What’s the direction from here?”"
"“啊，大人呀，从这里的东南西北都不是；因为去那儿的路不是直直的，却是东拐西弯；由此城堡之地并无一定方向，时而天南，时而地北，你自要当心，若见其在东，随之而行，必见这路兜了大半圈又折了回来，这等怪事屡屡发生，必让你心生悲伤，自己曾凭虚荣之心想要违拗天意，然老天若非乐意，定不会给城堡以方位；若老天一不顺心，会教全部城堡连同方位一并从地球上消失，将他们所居之处化为一片荒凉，渺无人烟，以此警告人类，上帝所欲必自为之，上帝之所不欲——”","“Ah, please you sir, it hath no direction from here; by reason that the road lieth not straight, but turneth evermore; wherefore the direction of its place abideth not, but is some time under the one sky and anon under another, whereso if ye be minded that it is in the east, and wend thitherward, ye shall observe that the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space of half a circle, and this marvel happing again and yet again and still again, it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of Him that giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth Him, and if it please Him not, will the rather that even all castles and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth, leaving the places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant, so warning His creatures that where He will He will, and where He will not He—”"
"“哦，好啦，好啦，咱们还是歇一会儿吧。别管什么方向了，让方向见鬼去吧——我向你说对不起，我向你说一千次对不起，我今天不大舒服，我自言自语时请不要在意，那是我的老毛病啦，很坏的老毛病了。要是吃些从自己出生之前就已经喂养了不知多久的东西，就会引起消化紊乱，这时要改那毛病还真是不易。苍天啊！吃下的童子鸡都有一千三百岁了，人体功能怎么还能保持正常呢。不过，嗐——别管那个了；咱们还是——你有没有那个地方的地图之类的？要知道好的地图——”","“Oh, that’s all right, that’s all right, give us a rest; never mind about the direction, HANG the direction—I beg pardon, I beg a thousand pardons, I am not well to-day; pay no attention when I soliloquize, it is an old habit, an old, bad habit, and hard to get rid of when one’s digestion is all disordered with eating food that was raised forever and ever before he was born; good land!A man can’t keep his functions regular on spring chickens thirteen hundred years old.But come—never mind about that; let’s—have you got such a thing as a map of that region about you?Now a good map—”"
"“莫非是今日那些异教徒从海外带回的那件事物，在油中炸过，辅以洋葱和盐，是——”","“Is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers have brought from over the great seas, which, being boiled in oil, and an onion and salt added thereto, doth—”"
"“什么，那是地图？你在说什么呀？你知道什么是地图吗？哦，哦，不要紧，不要解释，我讨厌解释，一解释事情就更云遮雾罩让人弄不清楚了。快去吧，亲爱的，日安了，带她出去，克拉伦斯。”","“What, a map?What are you talking about?Don’t you know what a map is?There, there, never mind, don’t explain, I hate explanations; they fog a thing up so that you can’t tell anything about it. Run along, dear; good-day; show her the way, Clarence.”"
"哦，好了，这下就很清楚了，那些傻瓜们为什么不对这些骗子们刨根问底。那个姑娘的心里在哪儿也许有点真事，不过我可不信你能用液压泵给它冲出来，哪怕用早些时候的爆破法也炸不出来，这次得用甘油炸药才成。哼，她是个十足的傻瓜；可是国王和他的骑士们却对她洗耳恭听，好像她是一页福音书呢。这帮人是什么样的就可想而知了。而且想想这个宫廷各方面是多么简单：这么个走江湖的乡下妞儿，竟然能不费吹灰之力就出入宫廷接近国王，比在我那个时代那个国家进入贫民院还容易。事实上，国王还很乐意接见她，很乐意听她讲故事；她将那次冒险献了出来，由此大受欢迎，如同尸体遇到了验尸官。","Oh, well, it was reasonably plain, now, why these donkeys didn’t prospect these liars for details.It may be that this girl had a fact in her somewhere, but I don’t believe you could have sluiced it out with a hydraulic; nor got it with the earlier forms of blasting, even; it was a case for dynamite.Why, she was a perfect ass; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel.It kind of sizes up the whole party.And think of the simple ways of this court: this wandering wench hadn’t any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country.In fact, he was glad to see her, glad to hear her tale; with that adventure of hers to offer, she was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner."
"我刚要停止东想西想，克拉伦斯回来了。我讲了自己如何对那姑娘努力半天却一无所获，没得到一丁点能帮我找到那个城堡的线索。小伙子看起来有点吃惊，或是纳闷，或是别的什么，他委婉地说，自己早就暗暗奇怪我为什么要问那姑娘那些问题。","Just as I was ending-up these reflections, Clarence came back.I remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl; hadn’t got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle.The youth looked a little surprised, or puzzled, or something, and intimated that he had been wondering to himself what I had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for."
"“哎呀，祖宗啊，”我说，“我难道不想去找那个城堡吗？不然我打听它干什么？”","“Why, great guns,” I said, “don’t I want to find the castle?And how else would I go about it?”"
"“啊，我的大老爷啊，小人认为这个问题很好回答。她会跟你一起走。他们总是这么做。她和你一起骑着马去。”","“La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween.She will go with thee.They always do. She will ride with thee.”"
"“和我骑着马去？胡说！”","“Ride with me?Nonsense!”"
"“可是她真的会去。她会骑马和你一起去。你等着瞧吧。”","“But of a truth she will.She will ride with thee.Thou shalt see.”"
"“什么？她和我一同翻山越岭——单身一人——而我则几乎是订了婚要结婚的人？呀，那可太不成体统了。想想那成什么样子。”","“What?She browse around the hills and scour the woods with me—alone—and I as good as engaged to be married?Why, it’s scandalous.Think how it would look.”"
"啊，那可爱的脸在我眼前冒了出来！那小家伙急巴巴地想知道这段风流韵事。我逼他发誓要保密，这才悄悄说出她的名字——“俏丫头芙兰娜甘”。　他看上去有点失望，说他不记得有这么位伯爵小姐。这个小马屁精自然想给她安个头衔。他问我她住哪儿。","My, the dear face that rose before me!The boy was eager to know all about this tender matter.I swore him to secresy and then whispered her name—“Puss Flanagan.” He looked disappointed, and said he didn’t remember the countess.How natural it was for the little courtier to give her a rank.He asked me where she lived."
"“在东哈——”我突然回过神来，打住了，脑子有点乱。一会儿，我又说道：“现在别管这个了，以后再告诉你。”","“In East Har—” I came to myself and stopped, a little confused; then I said, “Never mind, now; I’ll tell you some time.”"
"那他能见到她吗？某天我能让他见见她吗？","And might he see her?Would I let him see her some day?"
"答应他不过是小事一桩——约莫等一千三百年吧——他还那么着急见；于是我就说了声行。然而我还是叹了口气，忍不住叹了口气。不过叹气没有任何意义，她还没出生呢。可是，我们生来如此，要是动了感情，就不会推理了，光会动情了。","It was but a little thing to promise—thirteen hundred years or so—and he so eager; so I said Yes.But I sighed; I couldn’t help it.　And yet there was no sense in sighing, for she wasn’t born yet.But that is the way we are made: we don’t reason, where we feel; we just feel."
"那一天一夜大家不谈别的，光谈我的远征了，而那些小伙子们对我相当客气，对我很尊崇，好像把自己的烦恼与失望都抛在脑后，而来为我着急，让我把那些吃人恶魔一窝端了，把那些熟过头的老处女放出来，就好像是他们接了这个差事似的。对，他们是好孩子——不过仅仅是孩子，如此而已。他们还没完没了地指点我该如何搜寻巨人，如何降伏他们；他们告诉我各种破解魔法的咒语，还给了我些药膏和其他乱七八糟的东西，好让我抹在伤口上。可是他们谁也没想过，我要真是我装出来的那个了不起的巫师，我就没必要用什么药膏，或要别人指点，或用咒语破解魔法，尤其是在无论什么样的袭击下都不需要兵器铠甲——甚至对抗喷火的巨龙和刚从地狱中跑出来的魔鬼也不需要，更何况我要收拾的这种可怜的对手，只不过是从穷乡僻壤来的平常妖怪呢。","My expedition was all the talk that day and that night, and the boys were very good to me, and made much of me, and seemed to have forgotten their vexation and disappointment, and come to be as anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins loose as if it were themselves that had the contract.Well, they WERE good children—but just children, that is all.And they gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants, and how to scoop them in; and they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments, and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my wounds.But it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if I was such a wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be, I ought not to need salves or instructions, or charms against enchantments, and, least of all, arms and armor, on a foray of any kind—even against fire-spouting dragons, and devils hot from perdition, let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after, these commonplace ogres of the back settlements."
"我要早点吃完早饭，破晓就动身，因为这是例行的规矩；不过我不知费了他妈多长时间才把铠甲穿好，因此耽搁了一会儿。要穿上它可真够麻烦的，而且讲究太多了。首先你得用一到两层毯子把身体裹起来，垫着好隔开冰冷的铁甲；随后你要穿上袖子和锁子甲胸衣——这是用小巧的铁环编在一起做成的，弹性十足，往地上一扔，它就会瘪成一堆，像湿淋淋的渔网；这家伙还很沉，几乎相当于把世上所有最让人难受的材料堆在一起做成的睡衣，可是却有不少人为这个而穿它——税收官，改革家，还有那些全部家当只有一匹马却顶着空头衔的国王，反正都是这样的人；接着你要穿上鞋——像个平底船似的，上面罩着交织在一起的钢片——还要把那笨重的马刺旋着塞进后跟。下一步你要将护胫甲穿在小腿上，将腿甲穿在大腿上，一一扣好；随后是背甲和胸甲，这会儿你就会开始觉得有点憋得慌了；接下来将那半截裙甲挂在胸甲上，这裙甲是由许多宽钢片层叠在一起做成的，身前耷拉着，身后做成扇形，这样就可以坐得下；论外观，穿着，或者拿来擦手，它还不如一个倒过来的煤斗好用；往下就是挂上佩剑，将炉筒子套在胳膊上，将铁手套套在手上，铁捕鼠夹戴在脑袋上，还有一片破布似的铁网，耷拉在脖子后面——这就成了，就像蜡烛在蜡烛模子里般严丝合缝。这会儿跳舞可不行。对，一个人要是这么包起来，就像个不值得嗑开的干果一般，你费劲儿咬开，却发现和那外皮比起来，果肉少得可怜。","I was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was the usual way; but I had the demon’s own time with my armor, and this delayed me a little.It is troublesome to get into, and there is so much detail.First you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail—these are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt, yet plenty used it for that—tax collectors, and reformers, and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of people; then you put on your shoes—flat-boats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel—and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels.Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate, and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down, and isn’t any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt on your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms, your iron gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your head, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neck—and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould.This is no time to dance.Well, a man that is packed away like that is a nut that isn’t worth the cracking, there is so little of the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell."
"那帮小伙子帮了我一把，不然我这辈子也甭想穿上。我们刚刚穿好，贝迪维尔爵士碰巧来访，我发现自己选的这套行头对于出远门来讲不是最合适的。他看上去是多么庄严高贵啊，高大魁梧，威仪凛然。他头顶着锥形钢盔，刚到耳际，面甲仅仅是一根窄窄的钢条，向下延伸到上唇，护住他的鼻子；全身余下的部分，从脖子到脚跟，都是柔韧的锁子甲，无论是裤子还是别的什么。他差不多整个人都藏在外衣里面，外衣正如我提到的，当然也是锁子甲做的，从肩膀直垂到脚踝；从腰部往下，前后都是分叉的，这样他就能骑马，任由下摆垂在两侧。他正要动身寻找圣杯，而这行头也正合适。我倒是想花大价钱把这件宽松的长大衣搞到手，不过现在时候不早了，不能再磨蹭了。旭日初升，国王和群臣都到场为我送行，祝我好运。我要是再磨蹭就未免有点失礼了。靠自己可上不了马；可不是，你要是试试就准得失望。你得让他们抬上去，就好像把中暑的人抬到药店去一样，把你搁上去，帮你弄妥了，把你的双脚固定在马镫上；这功夫你会感觉很奇怪，憋得慌，好像不是自己了——像突然结婚了，或者被雷电劈过什么的，还没完全醒过神来，有点木木的，连东南西北也分不清了。接着他们竖起那杆他们称之为长矛的桅杆，插在我左脚边的托座里，让我用手抓住；最后他们把盾牌挂在我脖子上，这下子我可是万事俱备，只待起锚出海了。　大家对我是要多好有多好，还有一位宫女亲手献上了上马酒。现在没别的事，就等着那位少女爬上我背后的马鞍了，她果然就这么做了，还伸出一只胳膊搂着我，好稳着点。","The boys helped me, or I never could have got in.Just as we finished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as not I hadn’t chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip.How stately he looked; and tall and broad and grand.He had on his head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears, and for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his upper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of him, from neck to heel, was flexible chain mail, trousers and all.But pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment, which of course was of chain mail, as I said, and hung straight from his shoulders to his ankles; and from his middle to the bottom, both before and behind, was divided, so that he could ride and let the skirts hang down on each side.He was going grailing, and it was just the outfit for it, too.I would have given a good deal for that ulster, but it was too late now to be fooling around.The sun was just up, the king and the court were all on hand to see me off and wish me luck; so it wouldn’t be etiquette for me to tarry.You don’t get on your horse yourself; no, if you tried it you would get disappointed.They carry you out, just as they carry a sun-struck man to the drug store, and put you on, and help get you to rights, and fix your feet in the stirrups; and all the while you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else—like somebody that has been married on a sudden, or struck by lightning, or something like that, and hasn’t quite fetched around yet, and is sort of numb, and can’t just get his bearings.Then they stood up the mast they called a spear, in its socket by my left foot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield around my neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea. 　Everybody was as good to me as they could be, and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self.There was nothing more to do now, but for that damsel to get up behind me on a pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around me to hold on."
"于是我们就出发了，大家都挥着手绢或者头盔跟我们道别。我们顺着山坡下去，穿过一个村庄，遇到的人对我们都非常尊敬，只有几个穿得破破烂烂的小孩例外。他们喊道：","And so we started, and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their handkerchiefs or helmets.And everybody we met, going down the hill and through the village was respectful to us, except some shabby little boys on the outskirts.They said:"
"“哎，瞧那个家伙！”　还往我们身上扔土块。","“Oh, what a guy!” And hove clods at us."
"根据我的经验，从古至今男孩子们都是一路货色。他们什么都不尊重，什么事什么人都不在乎。在那远古时代，有位先知好好走着自己的路，没招谁惹谁，可他们会喊：“过来，秃头！”在中世纪这个神圣的黑暗世界里，他们对我粗鲁无礼，在布坎南总统执政期间，我也见过他们这么做。我记得这个，因为我就在当场，还帮忙来着。那位先知有他的熊帮忙，跟那些孩子算账了；我也想下马和他们算算帐，但是这可不行，因为我下去就再也上不来了。我憎恨没有起重机的国家。","In my experience boys are the same in all ages.They don’t respect anything, they don’t care for anything or anybody.They say “Go up, baldhead” to the prophet going his unoffending way in the gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy gloom of the Middle Ages; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan’s administration; I remember, because I was there and helped.The prophet had his bears and settled with his boys; and I wanted to get down and settle with mine, but it wouldn’t answer, because I couldn’t have got up again.I hate a country without a derrick."
"第十二章　缓慢的煎熬","CHAPTER 12 Slow Torture"
"转眼间我们就来到了乡下。在初秋凉爽的清晨，穿行于寂静的山林，真是无比惬意。从山顶望去，我们看到下面苍翠碧绿的山谷绵延开来，溪水蜿蜒其间，四处都是小岛般的树丛，还有高大孤独的橡树零星散落着，投下点点阴影；越过山谷我们看到了层层山脉笼罩在蓝色的薄雾里，如波浪般起伏延展，直指天际，浪尖上相隔很远的地方有着模模糊糊的白色或灰色斑点，我们知道那是城堡。我们穿过片片宽阔的天然草地，草地上还闪烁着点点露珠，而我们如幽灵般行走，脚下有草皮垫着，没有一点声音；我们如梦幻般穿过林中空地，空地上方树叶在阳光的浸润下将薄雾染成了绿色，我们脚旁的小溪清澈之极，冰冷无比，一路欢快地犹如窃窃私语般从礁石上流过，奏出轻柔的乐曲，悦耳动听；不时我们会把这个世界抛在身后，进入到肃穆阴森的森林深处，那些怕人的野生动物急匆匆跑过，在你还没弄明白声音从何而来就无影无踪了。这里只有起得最早的鸟儿出来了，忙忙碌碌，这儿唱一句，那儿吵一声；在密不可穿的遥远的树林里，不知从哪儿传来了神秘的叮叮咚咚声，原来是鸟儿在啄树干找虫子。而不久我们又会晃晃悠悠走到太阳地里去。","STRAIGHT off, we were in the country.It was most lovely and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn.From hilltops we saw fair green valleys lying spread out below, with streams winding through them, and island groves of trees here and there, and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade; and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills, blue with haze, stretching away in billowy perspective to the horizon, with at wide intervals a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit, which we knew was a castle.We crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew, and we moved like spirits, the cushioned turf giving out no sound of footfall; we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green light that got its tint from the sun-drenched roof of leaves overhead, and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of whispering music, comfortable to hear; and at times we left the world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich gloom of the forest, where furtive wild things whisked and scurried by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place where the noise was; and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious faroff hammering and drumming for worms on a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of the woods.And by and by out we would swing again into the glare."
"在约莫第三次，第四次还是第五次我们走到太阳地里的时候——大致就是这么个数，大约在太阳升起来两个小时以后——就变得没原来那么舒服了。天开始热了起来。这点非常明显。这次走出林子后，我们长途跋涉了半天，也没碰到任何荫凉。真是奇怪，小小的烦恼，一旦开了头，就会不断增长，成倍增加。一开始我压根就不在乎的东西，现在开始在乎起来——而且是越来越在乎，无时不刻不在乎。头十次或十五次我需要手绢时还似乎满不在乎；我继续走着，对自己说无所谓，那也不是多大个事儿，就把它抛之脑后。可是这会儿不一样了。我无时无刻不想要它，这家伙在我耳边唠唠叨叨，一刻也不安宁。我没法将它从脑袋里撵走。因此最后我终于大发脾气，心想，真要绞死那个人，造出这样的盔甲，连个口袋都没有。你瞧，我的手绢，还有别的东西，都放在头盔里，而这种头盔你自己根本拿不下来。我把东西放进里面的时候根本没想过这个，事实上我也不知道。我还以为放那儿会特别方便呢。所以现在，一想到它就在那儿，就在手边，离得如此之近，可就是够不到，这让人感觉更加糟糕，更无法忍受。是呀，十有八九你得不到的东西就是你想要的，大家都注意过这事儿。好啦，这下我脑子里别的什么也不想了，都忘得一干二净，光琢磨我的头盔了。走了一英里又一英里，这个念头挥之不去，我在心里想象着那块手绢，回忆着它的样子，任那咸咸的汗水不断地淌到眼睛里，而我又够不到手绢，这真让人恼火。写在纸上，看起来就是小事一桩，但这事儿可绝对不小，这是切切实实的悲惨苦难。要不是这样我才不会说呢。我打定主意下次一定随身带个小手提袋，爱看起来像什么样就像什么样吧，人们爱怎么说就怎么说吧。当然了，那些穿着铁皮的“圆桌”花花公子们会觉得这太不象话了，说不定还会为此闹个天翻地覆，但是对我而言，舒适是第一位的，派头要靠后站。就这样我们磨磨蹭蹭地向前走着，时不时还会踢起大片的尘土，一团团腾空而起，钻进我的鼻子里，呛得我直打喷嚏，哇哇乱叫。当然我说了些不该说的话，这我不否认。我比别人强不到哪儿去。","About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glare—it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours or so after sun-up—it wasn’t as pleasant as it had been.It was beginning to get hot. This was quite noticeable.We had a very long pull, after that, without any shade.Now it is curious how progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get a start.Things which I didn’t mind at all, at first, I began to mind now—and more and more, too, all the time.The first ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief I didn’t seem to care; I got along, and said never mind, it isn’t any matter, and dropped it out of my mind.But now it was different; I wanted it all the time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest; I couldn’t get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my temper and said hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it.You see I had my handkerchief in my helmet; and some other things; but it was that kind of a helmet that you can’t take off by yourself.That hadn’t occurred to me when I put it there; and in fact I didn’t know it.I supposed it would be particularly convenient there.And so now, the thought of its being there, so handy and close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all the worse and the harder to bear.Yes, the thing that you can’t get is the thing that you want, mainly; every one has noticed that.Well, it took my mind off from everything else; took it clear off, and centered it in my helmet; and mile after mile, there it stayed, imagining the handkerchief, picturing the handkerchief; and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes, and I couldn’t get at it.It seems like a little thing, on paper, but it was not a little thing at all; it was the most real kind of misery.I would not say it if it was not so.I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next time, let it look how it might, and people say what they would.Of course these iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was scandalous, and maybe raise Sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfort first, and style afterwards.So we jogged along, and now and then we struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course I said things I oughtn’t to have said, I don’t deny that.I am not better than others."
"在人烟稀少的英国，我们似乎碰不到什么人，连妖怪也没有一个；以我当时的心情，没碰到，对于妖怪来说那是福气，我是说，对于一个带着手绢的妖怪。大多数骑士见了妖怪，什么也不多想，只想要他的盔甲，而我只要他的大花手帕，他尽可留着他那些铁器，就我而言。","We couldn’t seem to meet anybody in this lonesome Britain, not even an ogre; and, in the mood I was in then, it was well for the ogre; that is, an ogre with a handkerchief.Most knights would have thought of nothing but getting his armor; but so I got his bandanna, he could keep his hardware, for all of me."
"同时，天越来越热了。你瞧，太阳直射下来，不停地将这些铁器晒得越来越热。唉，你要是那么热，任什么小事也能把你惹毛。我走得快了，就会像一堆碟子一样哐啷哐啷响，这真让我抓狂；再加上那盾牌在我身上碰来撞去，乒乓乱响，一会儿在胸前，一会儿在后背，让我受不了；要是我走得慢点儿，关节就吱吱嘎嘎作响，乱叫一气，就像一辆独轮车似的，烦死人了；而且因为我们以这种步伐带不出一丝微风，我简直就跟在炉子里炸了一样；此外，你越是安安静静地走，压在身上的钢铁就越沉，每一分钟你身上就好像增加了好几吨。而且你还得不停地换手，把长矛从这只脚边换到那只脚边，长时间用一只手擎着可够人受的。","Meantime, it was getting hotter and hotter in there.You see, the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more all the time.Well, when you are hot, that way, every little thing irritates you.When I trotted, I rattled like a crate of dishes, and that annoyed me; and moreover I couldn’t seem to stand that shield slatting and banging, now about my breast, now around my back; and if I dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does, and as we didn’t create any breeze at that gait, I was like to get fried in that stove; and besides, the quieter you went the heavier the iron settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh every minute.And you had to be always changing hands, and passing your spear over to the other foot, it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a time."
"唉，你知道的，要是你流汗流成这样，跟河水似的，早晚你都会——你都会——唉，你都会痒痒。你身子在里面，手在外面，所以啦，你就成了这样：中间除了铁皮，什么也没有。这可不是轻描淡写的事情，别以为听起来不算什么。　起初是一处痒痒，接着又来一处，接着好多处，而且还不断扩散开来，最后占领全部地盘，你感觉有多糟糕，有多难受，没人能想象出来。最厉害的时候，我眼看就支撑不住了，正在这时一只苍蝇从面甲栅栏的缝里钻了进来，落在我的鼻子上，而面甲上的铁条又粘住了，不能用。我没法把脸甲掀起来，只能晃动那已经烤得滚热的脑袋，而这只苍蝇——唉，你知道，要是一只苍蝇吃定了你，它会怎么做——我晃动脑袋只让它从鼻子挪到嘴唇上，从嘴唇挪到耳朵，在那儿到处嗡嗡飞，还不停落下来叮我，我本来就已经痛苦不堪了，这下可扛不住了。于是我屈服了，请阿丽桑德替我把头盔卸了下来，让我从里面解放了出来。接着她倒出里面的东西，舀了满满一头盔水，我喝了后站了起来，她将剩下的水都倒在我的盔甲里。这有多舒服，你绝对想象不出来。她继续舀水来倒进去，直到我都泡透了，全身都舒服了为止。","Well, you know, when you perspire that way, in rivers, there comes a time when you—when you—well, when you itch.You are inside, your hands are outside; so there you are; nothing but iron between.It is not a light thing, let it sound as it may.　First it is one place; then another; then some more; and it goes on spreading and spreading, and at last the territory is all occupied, and nobody can imagine what you feel like, nor how unpleasant it is.And when it had got to the worst, and it seemed to me that I could not stand anything more, a fly got in through the bars and settled on my nose, and the bars were stuck and wouldn’t work, and I couldn’t get the visor up; and I could only shake my head, which was baking hot by this time, and the fly—well, you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty—he only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz all around in there, and keep on lighting and biting, in a way that a person, already so distressed as I was, simply could not stand.So I gave in, and got Alisande to unship the helmet and relieve me of it.Then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water, and I drank and then stood up, and she poured the rest down inside the armor.One cannot think how refreshing it was.She continued to fetch and pour until I was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable."
"能休息一下，安静一会儿，真是不错。但人生在世，无论什么时候，都不会事事如意。前一阵子我做了一个烟斗，还有些相当不错的烟草；不是真正的烟草，而是印第安人抽的那种：就是柳树里层的皮，晾干了。这些让人舒坦的东西就放在头盔里，现在又在我手里了，可是没有火柴。","It was good to have a rest—and peace.But nothing is quite perfect in this life, at any time.I had made a pipe a while back, and also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but what some of the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow, dried.These comforts had been in the helmet, and now I had them again, but no matches."
"随着时间的流逝，我渐渐意识到一个令人烦恼的事实——那就是我们都被天气捆绑住了。一个穿上盔甲的新手，要是没有别人帮助，还要不小的帮助，是上不了马的。桑迪一个人帮忙是不够的，反正对我来说肯定不够。我们不得不一直等到有人过来。等着，静静地等着，本来倒也相当让人愉快，因为我正好有满肚子事需要考虑考虑，想找个机会来想想。我想试着弄明白，为什么考虑到有这么多不便，那些理性的或有点理性的人还是学会了穿盔甲；我今天遭的罪很明显是他们一生中每天都在遭受的，那他们怎么还能代代相传保持这种方式。我很想想通这点；而且我还要想出点办法来将这个恶习革除，劝大家让这愚蠢的风尚自行消亡；但在这种情形下思考简直是不可能的。有桑迪在，你就没法思考。","Gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was borne in upon my understanding—that we were weather-bound.An armed novice cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it.Sandy was not enough; not enough for me, anyway.We had to wait until somebody should come along.Waiting, in silence, would have been agreeable enough, for I was full of matter for reflection, and wanted to give it a chance to work.I wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or even half-rational men could ever have learned to wear armor, considering its inconveniences; and how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain that what I had suffered to-day they had had to suffer all the days of their lives.I wanted to think that out; and moreover I wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but thinking was out of the question in the circumstances.You couldn’t think, where Sandy was."
"她倒是相当听话，心眼儿也好，不过滔滔不绝地说起话来就像磨盘一样无休无止，像城里的货车和四轮车一样让人头疼。她要是有个塞子，还能让人舒服点。但你还不能给塞起来，因为这东西塞住了会死掉的。　她一天到晚都噼里啪啦讲个不停，你会认为她的零件早晚会出毛病。可是不会的，他们永远不会出故障，而且她永远也不会因为没话说而慢下来。她能整个整个礼拜地磨面，抽水，搅拌，而不用停下来加加油放放气。而结果呢，只不过是放屁。她从来就没什么想法，比一团雾气好不到哪儿去。　她就是个十足的废话篓子。我的意思是，她讲来讲去，喋喋不休，但她也就能这样了。　那天早上，因为我已经有了老大一堆别的麻烦，就没在意她这座磨坊；但是到了下午，有好几次我不得不说：","She was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted, but she had a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill, and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a city.If she had had a cork she would have been a comfort.But you can’t cork that kind; they would die. Her clack was going all day, and you would think something would surely happen to her works, by and by; but no, they never got out of order; and she never had to slack up for words.She could grind, and pump, and churn, and buzz by the week, and never stop to oil up or blow out.And yet the result was just nothing but wind.She never had any ideas, any more than a fog has. 　She was a perfect blatherskite; I mean for jaw, jaw, jaw, talk, talk, talk, jabber, jabber, jabber; but just as good as she could be. I hadn’t minded her mill that morning, on account of having that hornets’ nest of other troubles; but more than once in the afternoon I had to say:"
"“歇一会儿吧，孩子，你把国内的空气都这么用光了，明天国家就得进口了，没这码子事国库就够空的了。”","“Take a rest, child; the way you are using up all the domestic air, the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to-morrow, and it’s a low enough treasury without that.”"
"第十三章　自由人","CHAPTER 13 Freemen"
"唉，真奇怪，一个人心满意足的时候是如此短暂。刚才我还在骑着马受着罪的时候，要是能够在流水潺潺的小河旁，在与世隔绝的阴凉角落里，享受这份安静，这份悠闲，这份美妙的安宁，我还可以时不时往盔甲里倒点水，让自己自始至终都浑身舒坦，这简直就像天堂；然而没过一会儿我就感到不满了，一定程度上是由于我点不着烟斗——因为，尽管我早就开办了一个火柴厂，我却忘了随身带火柴——另一方面是因为我们什么吃的也没有。　这是另一个证明，这个时代的人们像孩子似的目光短浅。穿着盔甲的人上路时在自己的食物方面总是凭运气，而对于要他在长矛旁边挂上一篮子三明治的想法总是反感之极。整个“圆桌”骑士团体中的任何一位，估计都宁愿去死也不愿意被人看见自己在旗杆上挂这么个东西。可是这主意再明智不过了。我打算在头盔里偷偷带几个三明治，但是此举被人阻止了，我不得不找了个借口放在一边，结果被一只狗吃了。","YES, it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be contented.Only a little while back, when I was riding and suffering, what a heaven this peace, this rest, this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have seemed, where I could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then; yet already I was getting dissatisfied; partly because I could not light my pipe—for, although I had long ago started a match factory, I had forgotten to bring matches with me—and partly because we had nothing to eat. Here was another illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age and people.A man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey, and would have been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear.There was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff.And yet there could not be anything more sensible.It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet, but I was interrupted in the act, and had to make an excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them."
"夜幕降临了，随之而来的是一场暴雨。天黑得很快。不用说我们必须得扎营了。我为那位姑娘在一块岩石下找到了不错的庇护所，接着给自己也找了一处。可是我不得不穿着铠甲，因为我自己脱不下来，还不能请阿丽桑德来帮忙，因为那样看起来就像在众人面前宽衣解带。事实上还算不上脱衣服，因为里面我还穿着衣服。但是人从小就养成的成见不是一下子就能够消除的，我知道，等到脱掉那件短尾巴铁裙子的时候我就该难为情了。","Night approached, and with it a storm.The darkness came on fast.We must camp, of course.I found a good shelter for the demoiselle under a rock, and went off and found another for myself.But I was obliged to remain in my armor, because I could not get it off by myself and yet could not allow Alisande to help, because it would have seemed so like undressing before folk.It would not have amounted to that in reality, because I had clothes on underneath; but the prejudices of one’s breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump, and I knew that when it came to stripping off that bob-tailed iron petticoat I should be embarrassed."
"暴风雨一来，天气就变了；风刮得越来越猛，雨下得越来越大，天气变得越来越冷。不久，各种昆虫、蚂蚁和虫子什么的就都成群结队地从雨地里爬进我的铠甲来取暖了。虽然有些老老实实的，蜷在我的衣服里就不动弹了，可大多数都属于不怎么安分、不让人舒服的东西，一刻也不安宁，总是四处乱爬不知道在找些什么。特别是那些蚂蚁，排成令人讨厌的一队，从我的头顶爬到脚底，一个小时一个小时地爬个没完，让我痒得不行，这些东西，我一辈子都不要再和它们睡在一起了。有人要是也身处这种境况，我一定会奉劝他千万别摇晃或者翻身，因为这样就会激起各种各样动物的兴趣，弄得它们每一个都想出来瞧瞧出了什么事，那样一来就会把事情弄得更糟，自然也就让你骂得更厉害，假如还能骂得更厉害的话。　可是，如果一个人不摇晃，不翻身，那他还不如死掉。所以也许怎么做都一样，并没有真正的选择权。即使我冻得硬梆梆了也依然能够分辨出那种痒痒的感觉，就好像死尸接受电击疗法一样。　我决定在这次旅行后再也不穿铠甲了。","With the storm came a change of weather; and the stronger the wind blew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and colder it got.Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough, and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majority were of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still, but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what; especially the ants, which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and are a kind of creatures which I never wish to sleep with again.It would be my advice to persons situated in this way, to not roll or thrash around, because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on, and this makes things worse than they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder, too, if you can.　Still, if one did not roll and thrash around he would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other; there is no real choice.Even after I was frozen solid I could still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment.I said I would never wear armor after this trip."
"在倍受煎熬的几个小时里，我冻得浑身冰凉，一面又置身于烈火焚烧之中，都是托那群爬虫的福，同时我那疲惫的脑子里还总萦绕着同一个解不开的问题：这么倒霉的铠甲，人们怎么受得了呢？他们怎么还能一代代忍受下来呢？担心第二天还要受这样的罪，他们晚上怎么睡得着呢？","All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living fire, as you may say, on account of that swarm of crawlers, that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head: How do people stand this miserable armor?How have they managed to stand it all these generations?How can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day?"
"好不容易到了早上，我的情形要多糟有多糟：因为缺觉，憔悴不堪，昏昏欲睡，精疲力尽；一晚上辗转反侧，所以搞得疲惫不堪，长时间没有进食，饿得要死；想洗澡想得要命，好彻底摆脱这些动物；还得了风湿病，成了瘸子。而那位出身高贵、顶着贵族头衔的阿丽桑德·拉卡特萝丝小姐又是怎样呢？噢，她可是跟松鼠一样活蹦乱跳呢；她睡得跟个死人一样；至于洗澡，估计在这片国土上无论是她还是其他贵族从来就没洗过，所以她也没盼望过。按现代的标准衡量，他们，那些家伙，只能算是稍稍开化的野蛮人。这位尊贵的淑女丝毫没有流露出急着吃早餐的意思——这也带有野蛮人的味道。　那些不列颠人在路上习惯于长时间禁食，懂得如何忍饥挨饿；他们还懂得如何效仿印第安人和南美洲蟒蛇，在动身之前把肚子装满，以防路上没东西吃。桑迪肚子里装的东西大概能让她顶三天呢。","When the morning came at last, I was in a bad enough plight: seedy, drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing around, famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid of the animals; and crippled with rheumatism.And how had it fared with the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise?Why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had slept like the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any other noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was not missing it.Measured by modern standards, they were merely modified savages, those people.This noble lady showed no impatience to get to breakfast—and that smacks of the savage, too. 　On their journeys those Britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them; and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting, after the style of the Indian and the anaconda.As like as not, Sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch."
"太阳出来之前我们就动身了，桑迪骑着马，我一瘸一拐地跟在后面。过了半个钟头我们遇到了一群衣衫褴褛的家伙，聚在一起修理那条算不上路的路。他们对我就像动物般俯首帖耳；我提出要跟他们共用早餐，他们就受宠若惊，我这非同一般的屈尊让他们不知所措，一开始他们简直不能相信我是认真的。与我同行的那位淑女轻蔑地把小嘴一撅，闪到一旁；她用他们都能听得到的声音说，与其如此她宁愿和别的牲口一块儿吃——这话让这些可怜虫们十分尴尬，仅仅因为这话是在说他们，而不是因为侮辱或冒犯了他们，因为他们没有那种感觉。他们毕竟不是奴隶，不是谁的私有财产。讽刺的是，按照法律和一般说法，他们是自由人。这个国家十分之七的自由人口都是这个阶层，这个地位的：“独立的”小农户，手艺人，等等。也就是说，这些人就是这个国家的国民，是真正的国民；他们才是有用的，值得保存的，或者真正值得尊敬的，除去他们，整个国家就全没了，只剩下那些人渣，那些垃圾，披着国王、贵族和绅士的外衣，游手好闲，不事劳作，只会浪费和破坏，在任何结构合理的社会里都没有一丁点用处。然而，由于手腕高明，这一小撮镀了金的人，不仅没有呆在本属于自己的队伍末尾，反而昂首挺胸，高举大旗，在前面领路；这些人还把自己推选为整个国家的代表，而那些数不胜数的人却不发一言，对此听之任之，天长日久居然将此事奉为真理；不仅如此，他们还觉得这一贯正确，本该如此，牧师曾对这些自由人的父辈还有他们本人说，这种讽刺的令人啼笑皆非的状态都是上帝定的；于是，他们也不想想上帝怎么可能拿讽刺来寻开心，尤其是像这样显而易见容易戳穿的讽刺，就接受了这件事，毕恭毕敬，一声不吭了。","We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along behind.In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road.They were as humble as animals to me; and when I proposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest.My lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side; she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle—a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them, and not because it insulted or offended them, for it didn’t.And yet they were not slaves, not chattels.By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen.Seven-tenths of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree: small “independent” farmers, artisans, etc.; which is to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy, and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation and leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king, nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world.And yet, by ingenious contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged, was marching head up and banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself to be the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not only that, but to believe it right and as it should be.The priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how unlike God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especially such poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet."
"对于我这个从前的美国人来说，这些温顺的家伙说出来的话听起来很是奇怪。　　他们是自由人，但是未经允许不得离开领主或者主教的田宅；他们不能自己做面包，而必须在领主或主教的磨坊和烘焙房里磨面粉烤面包，同样还得付相当多的费用；要是他们想卖一份自己的产业，还得从收益中拿出相当可观的数目付给他，要买一份别人的产业，也必须用现金作为谢礼才能得到这份权利；他们还得免费为他收割庄稼，要随叫随到，哪怕自己家的庄稼眼看就要毁于风雨，也要扔下不管；他们不得不任他在自己家地里种果树，而当领主派那些毫不留心的人来摘水果，肆意践踏树周围的庄稼时，他们只能忍气吞声；领主出去打猎，大队人马从他们的土地上疾驰而过，糟蹋了他们千辛万苦种出来的庄稼，他们也只能强压怒火；他们不允许养鸽子，可是当成群的鸽子从领主大人的鸽舍飞出来，落到他们的庄稼上，他们可不能发火，一只也杀不得，要不严惩不贷；好不容易收获了庄稼，又来了一大队强盗来强取豪夺：首先是教会用大车拉走了它应得的十分之一，接着国王派来税官又抽走二十分之一，后来领主的人又吞噬了剩下的一大部分，最后，这些被层层剥皮的自由人才有自由将剩下的收进粮仓，如果还值得找这个麻烦的话；到处都是税，税，税，更多的税，这个税那个税——都加在这个独立自由的穷人头上，而没有加在他的领主或主教头上，也没加在挥霍无度的贵族和无所不贪的教会头上；要是男爵想清静地睡个觉，自由人即使辛苦劳作一天也得整晚不睡，用鞭子抽打池塘让青蛙保持安静；要是自由人的女儿——可是，唉，这是君主专制政府最臭名昭著的事情了，没法儿写出来；最终，如果这个自由人对所受的折磨感到绝望，觉得自己的人生在这种情况下令人无法忍受，决定牺牲性命，奔向死亡去寻求怜悯和庇护，仁慈的教会就罚他永受地狱之火的焚烧，温柔的法律则将他半夜埋在十字路口，背上还插着根木桩，而他的主人男爵或主教就会没收他的全部财产，将他的寡妇孤儿都撵出家门。","The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly American ear. 　　They were freemen, but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his permission; they could not prepare their own bread, but must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery, and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds, nor buy a piece of somebody else’s without remembering him in cash for the privilege; they had to harvest his grain for him gratis, and be ready to come at a moment’s notice, leaving their own crop to destruction by the threatened storm; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields, and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grain around the trees; they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves, and when the swarms from my lord’s dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose their temper and kill a bird, for awful would the penalty be; when the harvest was at last gathered, then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it: first the Church carted off its fat tenth, then the king’s commissioner took his twentieth, then my lord’s people made a mighty inroad upon the remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had liberty to bestow the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble; there were taxes, and taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes again, and yet other taxes -- upon this free and independent pauper, but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the wasteful nobility or the all-devouring Church; if the baron would sleep unvexed, the freeman must sit up all night after his day’s work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman’s daughter -- but no, that last infamy of monarchical government is unprintable; and finally, if the freeman, grown desperate with his tortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions, and sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentle Church condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle law buried him at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back, and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors. "
"现在这些自由人大清早就在这里集合，为他们的领主和主教修路，每人三天——免费的；每户的父兄子弟，免费干三天，他们的仆人还得加上一两天。唉，真像在书里读过的法国和法国人民的情形，在那场值得永久纪念与歌颂的大革命中，凭着一波潮水般鲜血的洗礼，将千年的罪恶一扫而光——仅此一次，那漫长的一千年里，所有的谬误、屈辱和苦难，只有地狱才可与之比肩，而这个民族所受的折磨，慢慢压榨出的每一桶鲜血，却只用半滴来偿还，就把那旧账一笔勾销了。总共有过两次“恐怖时代”，要是我们还没忘记，还能好好想想的话；一次是激情引起的杀人，一次是冷血无情的杀戮；前者仅仅持续了一个月，而后者却延续了千年；前者导致了一万人的丧生，而后者却害死了一亿人；而能让我们不寒而栗的“惨状”，却都是那次较小规模的恐怖所带来的，也就是说，那次短暂的恐怖所带来的；但是，瞬间死于斧头之下，与一生受尽饥饿、寒冷、凌辱、残忍和心碎之苦相比，又算得了什么惨状呢？刹那间被雷劈死，与在火刑柱上慢慢烧死比起来，算得了什么？死于那个短暂恐怖事件的人，一个市级公墓就可以容得下他们的棺材，而我们曾反复受过的教育让我们一想起他们就会心惊胆战，悲痛无比；可是死于更为久远更为真实的恐怖事件中的人，整个法兰西也难以装下他们的棺材——这次恐怖事件有说不出来的痛苦和恐惧，可是没有人教我们去看清它那巨大的力量或者它应得的悲悯。","And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishop’s road three days each—gratis; every head of a family, and every son of a family, three days each, gratis, and a day or so added for their servants.Why, it was like reading about France and the French, before the ever memorable and blessed Revolution, which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood—one: a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell.There were two “Reigns of Terror,” if we would but remember it and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are all for the “horrors” of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break?What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake?A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror—that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves."
"这些与我一起吃早餐，一起聊天的可怜虫们，这些表面上自由的人，对他们的国王、教会和贵族真是卑躬屈膝，毕恭毕敬，就算是最恨他们的对头看了也会心满意足的。这事可真让人可怜又滑稽荒唐。我问他们想没想过世上有这样一个民族，人人都有选举权，却选出这样一个家族，世世代代，无论贤愚，来永久统治这个国家，而把其他所有家族，包括选举人的，都排除在外；他们会不会还选出一百个家族，抬举到让人目眩的高位，赋予咄咄逼人的世袭荣誉和特权，而把这个国家其他的家庭都排除在外——包括选举人自己的。","These poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast and their talk with me, were as full of humble reverence for their king and Church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire.There was something pitifully ludicrous about it.I asked them if they supposed a nation of people ever existed, who, with a free vote in every man’s hand, would elect that a single family and its descendants should reign over it forever, whether gifted or boobies, to the exclusion of all other families—including the voter’s; and would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of rank, and clothed on with offensive transmissible glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nation’s families—INCLUDING HIS OWN."
"他们看上去都茫然无知，说不知道，以前从来没有考虑过这个问题，他们也从来不会想到在一个国家里人人都能参与国家大事。我说我就见到过这样一个国家——这个国家一直持续到有了国教为止。他们又一次都茫然了——乍听之下。　不过不久就有个人抬起头来，请我把刚才的话再说一遍，说慢点，好让他慢慢领悟话里的意思。我照做了，过了一会儿，他恍然大悟，拳头往下一砸，说他根本不信会有这么一个国家，大家都有选举权，却甘愿活得如此卑微，窃取民心民意肯定是犯罪，而且是头等大罪。我心里想：","They all looked unhit, and said they didn’t know; that they had never thought about it before, and it hadn’t ever occurred to them that a nation could be so situated that every man COULD have a say in the government.I said I had seen one—and that it would last until it had an Established Church.Again they were all unhit—at first.But presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again; and state it slowly, so it could soak into his understanding.I did it; and after a little he had the idea, and he brought his fist down and said HE didn’t believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way; and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes.I said to myself:"
"“这才是个人。要是我能得到足够多这种人的支持，我就能为这个国家的繁荣做出一番事业，通过全面改变国家机制来证明我才是这个国家最忠诚的公民。”","“This one’s a man. If I were backed by enough of his sort, I would make a strike for the welfare of this country, and try to prove myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its system of government.”"
"你瞧，我所谓的忠诚是对国家的忠诚，而不是对国家制度或者当权者的忠诚。国家才是真实的东西，实实在在的东西，永恒的东西；国家才是应该受到照看与呵护，并对其忠诚的东西；制度是外在的，只不过是层外衣，而衣服是会穿破的，会变得破破烂烂，穿着不再舒服，不再能让身体免于寒冬、疾病和死亡。对破衣烂衫忠诚，对它呐喊，对它顶礼膜拜，为它鞠躬尽瘁——这是愚忠，是动物的行为；它属于君主专制，由君主专制体制发明的，还是由君主专制自己留着吧。我来自康涅狄格州，这个州的宪法宣称“一切政治权力都来自于人民，一切自由政府都要以人民的意志为基础，为人民的利益而建立；无论何时人民都有不可否认、不可剥夺的权力，以他们认为合适的方式，来改变政体的形式。”","You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one’s country, not to its institutions or its office-holders.The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death.To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags—that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented by monarchy; let monarchy keep it.I was from Connecticut, whose Constitution declares “that all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit; and that they have AT ALL TIMES an undeniable and indefeasible right to ALTER THEIR FORM OF GOVERNMENT in such a manner as they may think expedient.”"
"本着这一原则，如果哪位公民觉得国家的政治外衣已经破烂了，而依然保持沉默，不鼓动国家换一件新的，那么他就是不忠了，他就是一个叛国贼。虽然可能他是唯一一个看到这种腐败的，但这并不能为他开脱；无论如何他有义务去鼓动，而别人也有义务来否决他，如果他们跟他的看法不一样的话。","Under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth’s political clothes are worn out, and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is a traitor.That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate anyway, and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does."
"而我现在呆在这样一个国家里，每一千个人里，仅有六人对国家如何管理有发言权。那九百九十四个，要是对现有制度表示不满，提议要改革，那六个人就得不约而同浑身打颤，认为这是如此的叛逆不忠，如此的厚颜无耻，简直就是万恶该死的叛国之罪。可以说，我好像成了一家公司的股东，公司里九百九十四位员工出了所有的本钱，做了所有的工作，而还有六位却毛遂自荐，将自己推举出来组成永久的董事会，篡取所有的红利。在我看来，那九百九十四个傻瓜需要的是一次重新洗牌。这件事情一定能最大程度发挥我天性中爱热闹的一面，辞去老板一职，发动一场起义，并将其演变成一场革命；但是我知道，如果不先将这些革命的原料教育好，达到能进行革命的程度，那就只能像杰克·凯德或者华特·泰勒一样一败涂地了。尽管有点自夸自卖，但我还从来没有一败涂地过呢。因此，这次在我心里酝酿成形的“洗牌”活动，跟凯德、泰勒的那种完全不同。","And now here I was, in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population.For the nine hundred and ninety-four to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose to change it, would have made the whole six shudder as one man, it would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid black treason.So to speak, I was become a stockholder in a corporation where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all the money and did all the work, and the other six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends.It seemed to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was a new deal.The thing that would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution; but I knew that the Jack Cade or the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely certain to get left.I had never been accustomed to getting left, even if I do say it myself.Wherefore, the “deal” which had been for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the Cade-Tyler sort."
"所以，我就没有跟那个人谈到流血和起义，他坐在那儿和那群饱受虐待愚弄的绵羊们坐在一起，嚼着黑面包，我把他拉到一边，跟他讲了点别的事。讲完之后，我让他从他的血管里借一滴血作墨水，用这滴墨水和一片木屑，我在树皮上写到——把他放到“造人工厂”里去——之后把这交给他，说道：","So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him.After I had finished, I got him to lend me a little ink from his veins; and with this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark—Put him in the Man-factory—and gave it to him, and said:"
"“把它送到卡米洛，交到阿米亚斯·勒·保雷手里，我管他叫克拉伦斯，他会明白的。”","“Take it to the palace at Camelot and give it into the hands of Amyas le Poulet, whom I call Clarence, and he will understand.”"
"“那他是个牧师喽。”这家伙说，脸上的热情退却了几分。","“He is a priest, then,” said the man, and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face."
"“怎么了——牧师怎么了？我不是告诉过你，不论是教会的牛马，还是教皇或主教的不带镣铐的奴隶，都不能进入到我的造人工厂吗？我不是告诉过你，你的宗教信仰，无论是何信仰，除非是你的自由选择，否则你也不能进入吗？","“How—a priest?Didn’t I tell you that no chattel of the Church, no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my Man-Factory?Didn’t I tell you that YOU couldn’t enter unless your religion, whatever it might be, was your own free property?”"
"“啊呀，是这样啊，这我就开心了；不过乍一听有个牧师在那儿，倒教我顿生不快，满心怀疑。”","“Marry, it is so, and for that I was glad; wherefore it liked me not, and bred in me a cold doubt, to hear of this priest being there.”"
"“不过我跟你说，他可不是牧师。”","“But he isn’t a priest, I tell you.”"
"那家伙看起来却还不满意。他说：","The man looked far from satisfied.He said:"
"“他不是牧师，怎么还识字呢？”","“He is not a priest, and yet can read?”"
"“他不是牧师，可是识字——对呀，不但识字，还会写呢。我亲自教他的。”那家伙脸上明朗起来。“而且你自己到了那个工厂，第一件要学的事情也是这个——”","“He is not a priest and yet can read—yes, and write, too, for that matter.I taught him myself.” The man’s face cleared.“And it is the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that Factory—”"
"“我？我情愿将心血沥干来学习此事。 啊，我甘愿做你的奴隶，你的——”","“I?I would give blood out of my heart to know that art.  Why, I will be your slave, your—”"

"我为这顿早饭付了三便士，这个价钱可也真够贵的，因为用这些钱都可以请十几个人吃顿早饭了。不过这会儿我感觉还不错，而且我一向都大手大脚惯了，况且这些人自己还食不果腹，却要请我白吃他们的，所以为了着重表达我的感激和真诚的感谢之情而慷慨解囊，这也是乐事一桩，而且那些钱给了他们可比放在我头盔里强多了，因为，这些便士是铁的，分量十足，半个美元的重量对于我来说就是好大的负担了。没错，那些日子我花起钱来也太随意了；不过这是有原因的，我在英国逗留了这么久，却还是没能完全调整过来衡量事物的尺度——还没有完全意识到亚瑟王国家里的一便士和康涅狄格州的两美元差不多完全相等：在购买力方面，可以说是一奶同胞。如果我从卡米洛晚几天出发的话，就能拿我们自己造币厂出产的漂亮的新硬币付给这些人了，那我该多高兴啊，而且这些人也会跟我一样高兴的。我全盘照搬了美国的币值。再过一两个周，一分的硬币，五分的镍币，一角的银币，两角五分和五角的银币，还有少量金币，就会如涓涓细流般在整个王国的商业血脉中流通起来，而我正盼望这股新鲜血液能让这个国家恢复生机。","I PAID three pennies for my breakfast, and a most extravagant price it was, too, seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that money; but I was feeling good by this time, and I had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway; and then these people had wanted to give me the food for nothing, scant as their provision was, and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial lift where the money would do so much more good than it would in my helmet, where, these pennies being made of iron and not stinted in weight, my half-dollar’s worth was a good deal of a burden to me.I spent money rather too freely in those days, it is true; but one reason for it was that I hadn’t got the proportions of things entirely adjusted, even yet, after so long a sojourn in Britain—hadn’t got along to where I was able to absolutely realize that a penny in Arthur’s land and a couple of dollars in Connecticut were about one and the same thing: just twins, as you may say, in purchasing power.If my start from Camelot could have been delayed a very few days I could have paid these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint, and that would have pleased me; and them, too, not less.I had adopted the American values exclusively.In a week or two now, cents, nickels, dimes, quarters, and half-dollars, and also a trifle of gold, would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through the commercial veins of the kingdom, and I looked to see this new blood freshen up its life."
"那几个农户为了报答我的慷慨大方，非要送我点什么东西，不管我愿不愿意，因此我就让他们送我副火石火镰，他们一把我和桑迪舒舒服服安顿上了马，我就马上点上了烟斗。当第一缕烟从我的头盔缝里冒出来时，那帮人都逃到了树林里，桑迪则身子后仰咕咚一声摔到了地上。他们以为我是会喷火的毒龙，就是他们从那些骑士和职业骗子口中经常听到的那种。我费了好大周折才劝得那些人壮起胆子往回走了两步，走到能听到解释的地方。然后我跟他们讲，这只是个小小的魔法，只会伤害我的敌人，对他们没什么影响。我还把手放在胸口上承诺，凡是对我没有敌意的人，只要走上前来，从我面前经过，大家就会看到只有那些留在后面的人才会被劈死。这大队人马很快就动了起来。没有伤亡报告，因为没人有那份好奇心留在后面看看到底会发生什么。","The farmers were bound to throw in something, to sort of offset my liberality, whether I would or no; so I let them give me a flint and steel; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed Sandy and me on our horse, I lit my pipe.When the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet, all those people broke for the woods, and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud.They thought I was one of those fire-belching dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars.I had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance.Then I told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies.And I promised, with my hand on my heart, that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead.The procession moved with a good deal of promptness.There were no casualties to report, for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen."
"这样一来我就耽误了不少时间，因为这些大孩子们恐惧退却之后就琢磨起我那让人敬畏的烟火来，他们是如此着迷我只好呆在那儿抽了两袋子烟，他们才肯放我走。　不过耽误这会儿功夫也不是一点收获没有，你知道，桑迪离我的烟火那么近，要让她完全适应这个新玩意儿，还真得费些功夫。而且这还堵上了她磨盘般的话匣子，堵上好一会儿呢，这也是一大收获。不过最大的好处是，我长了见识。现在无论来什么样的巨人或妖怪我都不怕了。","I lost some time, now, for these big children, their fears gone, became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling fireworks that I had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they would let me go. 　Still the delay was not wholly unproductive, for it took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing, she being so close to it, you know.It plugged up her conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, and that was a gain.But above all other benefits accruing, I had learned something.I was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along, now."
"那天晚上我们住在一位虔诚的隐士家里，到了第二天下午过半的时候我的机会来了。我们正抄近路穿过一片宽阔的草地，而我漫无目的地想着心事，什么也没听到没看到，正在这时，桑迪突然停下了从早上说到现在的话，大喊了一声：","We tarried with a holy hermit, that night, and my opportunity came about the middle of the next afternoon.We were crossing a vast meadow by way of short-cut, and I was musing absently, hearing nothing, seeing nothing, when Sandy suddenly interrupted a remark which she had begun that morning, with the cry:"
"“大人请防备！前面有生命危险！”","“Defend thee, lord!—peril of life is toward!”"
"她滑下马来，跑了几步，又停住了。我抬头望去，只见远处树荫下立着六七个全副武装的骑士和他们的侍从；刹那间他们就忙乱起来，勒紧马肚带，翻身上马。我的烟斗早就准备好了，要不是我走神了，净想着怎样才能在这个国家里解除压迫，在不得罪任何人的情况下将被窃取的权力和做人的资格归还于人民。我马上点着了烟斗，等我蓄足了满满一斗烟，他们就来了。他们还是一拥而上；没有一个像书上写的那样，彬彬有礼，慷慨高尚——一次过来一个彬彬有礼的无赖，其余的都站在一旁，看着双方公平竞争。不，他们要上就全体出动，呼啦啦冲了上来，就像一排炮弹一起发射一样；他们低着头，盔缨飘在后面，挺着长矛一致前进。场面很壮观，真是美不胜收——对于一个在树上的人来讲。我放下长矛，在那儿等着，心嗵嗵直跳，等到这波钢铁的波浪要冲到我身上了，才从头盔的缝隙里喷出一股白烟来。你真该看看这波人是如何七零八落，四处奔逃的！这可比刚才那场面好看多了。","And she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood.I looked up and saw, far off in the shade of a tree, half a dozen armed knights and their squires; and straightway there was bustle among them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount.My pipe was ready and would have been lit, if I had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging anybody.I lit up at once, and by the time I had got a good head of reserved steam on, here they came.All together, too; none of those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about—one courtly rascal at a time, and the rest standing by to see fair play.No, they came in a body, they came with a whirr and a rush, they came like a volley from a battery; came with heads low down, plumes streaming out behind, lances advanced at a level.It was a handsome sight, a beautiful sight—for a man up a tree.I laid my lance in rest and waited, with my heart beating, till the iron wave was just ready to break over me, then spouted a column of white smoke through the bars of my helmet.You should have seen the wave go to pieces and scatter!This was a finer sight than the other one."
"然而这些人跑了二三百码就停了下来，这弄得我很是烦恼。　我的高兴劲一下子垮掉了，取而代之的是恐惧，我断定我输了。　可是桑迪却容光焕发，还打算长篇大论呢——然而我阻止了她，告诉她我的魔法不知怎么搞的不灵了，她必须赶快上马，我们得骑马逃命去。不，她偏不上。她说我的法术已经让那些骑士失去了战斗力；他们不骑马跑，是因为他们办不到；等着吧，他们马上就会滚下马鞍，他们的坐骑和鞍辔就归我们了。我不忍心欺骗这个容易轻信头脑简单的家伙，所以我就说搞错了，我的烟火只要是能置人死地，那就会让他们顷刻之间毙命的；可是，这些人没死，说明我的设备出了问题，我也不知道怎么回事，不过我们必须抓紧时间逃跑，因为那些人再过一分钟就又会攻打我们了。桑迪笑了，说道：","But these people stopped, two or three hundred yards away, and this troubled me. 　My satisfaction collapsed, and fear came; I judged I was a lost man. 　But Sandy was radiant; and was going to be eloquent—but I stopped her, and told her my magic had miscarried, somehow or other, and she must mount, with all despatch, and we must ride for life.No, she wouldn’t.She said that my enchantment had disabled those knights; they were not riding on, because they couldn’t; wait, they would drop out of their saddles presently, and we would get their horses and harness.I could not deceive such trusting simplicity, so I said it was a mistake; that when my fireworks killed at all, they killed instantly; no, the men would not die, there was something wrong about my apparatus, I couldn’t tell what; but we must hurry and get away, for those people would attack us again, in a minute.Sandy laughed, and said:"
"“哎呦，大人，他们才不是那块料呢！兰斯洛特爵士能向毒龙挑战，等毒龙来了，反复战斗，直到他得胜，将他们杀得片甲不留；培利诺爵士，阿格洛瓦爵士，卡拉多斯爵士同样也能，不过其他人都没胆量试，就让那帮闲汉爱说什么就说什么吧。哎呀，至于远处那些小毛贼，大人觉得他们还没吃尽苦头，还敢来讨打吗？”","“Lack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed!Sir Launcelot will give battle to dragons, and will abide by them, and will assail them again, and yet again, and still again, until he do conquer and destroy them; and so likewise will Sir Pellinore and Sir Aglovale and Sir Carados, and mayhap others, but there be none else that will venture it, let the idle say what the idle will.And, la, as to yonder base rufflers, think ye they have not their fill, but yet desire more?”"
"“哦，那么他们在等什么呢？他们为什么不走开？没人拦着他们。我的天，我倒是乐意既往不咎，真的。”","“Well, then, what are they waiting for?Why don’t they leave?Nobody’s hindering.Good land, I’m willing to let bygones be bygones, I’m sure.”"
"“走开？哎呀，对此大人尽管放宽心。他们做梦也不敢，真的，他们可不敢。他们在等着投降呢。”","“Leave, is it?Oh, give thyself easement as to that.They dream not of it, no, not they.They wait to yield them.”"
"“哦——真的，‘端的’——用你们的话说？他们要想投降，干嘛不来投降呢？”","“Come—really, is that ’sooth’—as you people say?If they want to, why don’t they?”"
"“他们巴不得呢，不过您要知道毒龙的厉害，您就不会责怪他们了。他们吓得不敢过来了。”","“It would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed, ye would not hold them blamable.They fear to come.”"
"“哦，那么，假如换我过去找他们，那——”","“Well, then, suppose I go to them instead, and—”"
"“啊，若大人过去他们如何担当得起。让小的过去就是了。”","“Ah, wit ye well they would not abide your coming.I will go.”"
"她就过去了。要是带她去抓差办案还真是方便。换我自己，对这趟差事肯定感到拿不准。很快我就看到那帮骑士骑着马走了，桑迪也往回走了。这下让人松了口气。我断定她不知怎么的没抢尽先机——我是说在谈话方面，否则这场面谈时间不能这么短。可是结果证明实际上她办事办得不错，简直好极了。她说她一告诉那群人我就是“我们的头子”，就给了他们致命一击，用她的话来说就是“唬得他们魂飞魄散恐惧万分”；接下来他们就对她言听计从，一切都按她的要求来了。因此她让他们发誓，说两天之内带上全副鞍马到亚瑟王的宫廷投降，从此之后成为我手下的骑士，听从我的差遣。这件事她办得可比我能办到的强多啦！她真是个活宝。","And she did.She was a handy person to have along on a raid.I would have considered this a doubtful errand, myself.I presently saw the knights riding away, and Sandy coming back.That was a relief.I judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings—I mean in the conversation; otherwise the interview wouldn’t have been so short.But it turned out that she had managed the business well; in fact, admirably.She said that when she told those people I was The Boss, it hit them where they lived: “smote them sore with fear and dread” was her word; and then they were ready to put up with anything she might require.So she swore them to appear at Arthur’s court within two days and yield them, with horse and harness, and be my knights henceforth, and subject to my command.How much better she managed that thing than I should have done it myself!She was a daisy."
"第十五章　桑迪的故事","CHAPTER 15 Sandy’s Tale"
"“如此一来我可是好些骑士的主人了，”我们骑马离开时我说道，“谁能想到这类人才会归到我的手下呢？我真不知道该怎么处置他们，除非我用他们举行抽奖卖了。　有多少名来着，桑迪？”","“AND so I’m proprietor of some knights,”said I, as we rode off. 　“Who would ever have supposed that I should live to list up assets of that sort.I shan’t know what to do with them; unless I raffle them off. 　How many of them are there, Sandy?”"
"“回大人，有七名，不算仆人。”","“Seven, please you, sir, and their squires.”"
"“还真不少。都是些什么人啊？都在哪儿闲混呀？”","“It is a good haul.Who are they?Where do they hang out?”"
"“都在哪儿闲混？”","“Where do they hang out?”"
"“是呀，都住在哪里呀？”","“Yes, where do they live?”"
"“啊呀，小女子一时未解大人之意。且容我随即道来。”　　接着她边沉思冥想，边娓娓道来，将那几个词在舌尖巧妙地绕来绕去：“闲混——闲混——在哪儿闲——他们在哪儿闲混；哦，对了，他们在哪儿闲混。此言当真措辞考究，字字珠玑，优雅动听。闲暇之余小女定当重复千次万次，兴许还能学得一二也未可知。他们在哪儿闲混。千真万确！我已经脱口而出了，鉴于——”","“Ah, I understood thee not. That will I tell eftsoons.” 　Then she said musingly, and softly, turning the words daintily over her tongue: “Hang they out—hang they out—where hang—where do they hang out; eh, right so; where do they hang out.Of a truth the phrase hath a fair and winsome grace, and is prettily worded withal.I will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse, whereby I may peradventure learn it.Where do they hang out.Even so! already it falleth trippingly from my tongue, and forasmuch as—”"
"“别忘了那些牛仔，桑迪。”","“Don’t forget the cowboys, Sandy.”"
"“牛仔？”","“Cowboys?”"
"“对呀，那些骑士，你明白的，你不是要跟我讲讲他们的事情吗？你还记得不，就刚才。打个比方，比赛要开始了。”","“Yes; the knights, you know: You were going to tell me about them.A while back, you remember.Figuratively speaking, game’s called.”"
"“比赛——”","“Game—”"
"“对呀对呀！站到球手的位置吧。我是说，开始一五一十讲讲吧，点个火别费这么多柴火。跟我讲讲那些骑士的事情。”","“Yes, yes, yes!Go to the bat.I mean, get to work on your statistics, and don’t burn so much kindling getting your fire started.Tell me about the knights.”"
"“小女乐于从命，马上一一道来。且说二人上马起程，来到一片茂密的森林里。接着——”","“I will well, and lightly will begin.So they two departed and rode into a great forest.And—”"
"“天哪！”","“Great Scott!”"
"你看，我马上就意识到了自己的错误。我又打开了她的话匣子，这都怪我自己，她得扯上三十天才能扯到正事上去。而且她大多时候开始也没个开场白，结尾也没个交代。要是你打断她，她要么一个劲儿讲下去，压根儿不理你，要么敷衍两句，又回到原来的话题，从头再说一遍。所以，打断她的话有害无益；而我为了保命，非得打断她不可，还得时不时打断一下；如果任由她整天在耳边重复千篇一律的话，准得送了命。","You see, I recognized my mistake at once.I had set her works a-going; it was my own fault; she would be thirty days getting down to those facts.And she generally began without a preface and finished without a result.If you interrupted her she would either go right along without noticing, or answer with a couple of words, and go back and say the sentence over again.So, interruptions only did harm; and yet I had to interrupt, and interrupt pretty frequently, too, in order to save my life; a person would die if he let her monotony drip on him right along all day."
"“天啊！”我痛苦地喊了一声。她又倒了回去，从头开始讲：","“Great Scott!”I said in my distress.She went right back and began over again:"
"“且说二人上马起程，来到一片茂密的树林里。接着——”","“So they two departed and rode into a great forest.And—”"
"“哪二人？”","“WHICH two?”"
"“高文爵士和尤文爵士。接着他们来到一座住着修士的修道院，美美地住了一晚。次日拂晓，在修道院听完了弥撒，他们随即又上马起程，来到了一片茂密的森林；高文爵士忽然看见山谷里有一座塔楼，还有十二名美丽的少女，有两名骑士全身披挂，骑着高头大马，而少女们在一棵树旁走来走去。高文爵士随之又看到在那棵树上挂着一面白色盾牌，众少女走到盾牌前都会朝它吐一口，还有人往盾牌上扔泥巴——”","“Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine.And so they came to an abbey of monks, and there were well lodged.So on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey, and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret, of twelve fair damsels, and two knights armed on great horses, and the damsels went to and fro by a tree.And then was Sir Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon the shield—”"
"“哎，要不是我在这个国家亲眼见过这样的事，桑迪，我才不会相信你说的话呢。但是我曾见过，现在我仿佛就能看到那些家伙在盾牌前耀武扬威，做出上述种种。这儿的女人做什么都跟鬼迷心窍似的。没错，我说的就是你们最拔尖的女人，上层社会里千挑万选出来的。顺着电话线一万英里范围内最不起眼的接线女孩也有资格教导亚瑟王庭里最高贵的公爵夫人什么是温和、耐心、谦虚和礼貌。”","“Now, if I hadn’t seen the like myself in this country, Sandy, I wouldn’t believe it.But I’ve seen it, and I can just see those creatures now, parading before that shield and acting like that.The women here do certainly act like all possessed.Yes, and I mean your best, too, society’s very choicest brands.The humblest hello-girl along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness, patience, modesty, manners, to the highest duchess in Arthur’s land.”"
"“接线女孩？”","“Hello-girl?”"
"“不错，不过别让我解释啦；这种女孩过去没有；你们这儿没有这种女孩；她们一点错没有的时候人们也常常冲她们发火，在一千三百年里你都会感到过意不去，羞惭不已，感到这种行为真是太丢人了，太卑鄙了，毫无道理；实际上，绅士是不会这么做的——尽管我——唉，我自己，如果非得坦白的话——”","“Yes, but don’t you ask me to explain; it’s a new kind of a girl; they don’t have them here; one often speaks sharply to them when they are not the least in fault, and he can’t get over feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years, it’s such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked; the fact is, no gentleman ever does it—though I—well, I myself, if I’ve got to confess—”"
"“或许她——”","“Peradventure she—”"
"“别管她了，别管她了；告诉你，我怎么解释你也不会懂的。”","“Never mind her; never mind her; I tell you I couldn’t ever explain her so you would understand.”"
"“大人既然执意如此，小女只好作罢。接着高文爵士与尤文爵士走上前去，躬身行礼，问他们为何如此鄙视那块盾牌。‘二位爵士，’少女们回答，‘且容小女们一一道来。此盾牌乃本国一骑士所有，此人端的是武艺过人，只是凡是淑女闺秀他无不憎恶，因此我等才拿这盾牌撒气。’‘以在下愚见，’高文爵士言道，‘堂堂骑士断无憎恶淑女闺秀之理，许是事出有因，许是此君与别处名媛淑女两情相悦也未可知，况如尔等所言，此君乃堂堂勇士——’”","“Even so be it, sith ye are so minded.Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked them why they did that despite to the shield.Sirs, said the damsels, we shall tell you.There is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield, and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all ladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to the shield.I will say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause, and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of—”"
"“堂堂勇士——不错，勇士才讨她们喜欢呢，桑迪。而有谋之士——这她们就从来也想不到啦。汤姆·索耶——约翰·希南——约翰·劳·沙利文——可惜你们不能到这儿来。你们要是来了，不出二十四小时，就能坐到“圆桌”旁，名字前面加上“爵士”头衔；再有二十四小时，你们还能让宫里已婚的公主和伯爵夫人们移情别恋。事实上，宫里只不过是些精心打扮过的科曼契人，这里的哪个女人不是随时在等待暗号，一看哪个小子腰带上挂的头皮多就跟哪个跑？”","“Man of prowess—yes, that is the man to please them, Sandy.Man of brains—that is a thing they never think of.Tom Sayers—John Heenan—John L. Sullivan—pity but you could be here.You would have your legs under the Round Table and a ’Sir’ in front of your names within the twenty-four hours; and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses of the Court in another twenty-four.The fact is, it is just a sort of polished-up court of Comanches, and there isn’t a squaw in it who doesn’t stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt.”"
"“‘——况如尔等所言，此君乃堂堂勇士’，高文爵士说道，‘敢问他姓甚名谁？’‘阁下，’众少女回道，‘此人乃国王之子爱尔兰王子马霍斯。’","“—and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of, said Sir Gawaine.Now, what is his name?Sir, said they, his name is Marhaus the king’s son of Ireland.”"
"“你是说爱尔兰国王的儿子吧；你那样说是听不出什么意思的。当心，抓紧了，咱们得跳过这道沟……好啦，这下好啦。这匹马是马戏团的吧，他可真是生不逢时。”","“Son of the king of Ireland, you mean; the other form doesn’t mean anything.And look out and hold on tight, now, we must jump this gully....There, we are all right now.This horse belongs in the circus; he is born before his time.”"
"‘吾熟知此人，’尤文爵士言道，‘此君乃当世之英勇骑士。’”","“I know him well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as any is on live.”"
"“当世。桑迪，要说你这人真有什么毛病的话，那就是你有点迂腐。不过不要紧。”","“ON LIVE.If you’ve got a fault in the world, Sandy, it is that you are a shade too archaic.But it isn’t any matter.”"
"“‘——一日，众骑士济济一堂，吾曾目睹此人大显奇能，无人能敌。’‘啊，’高文爵士言道，‘众位女士，这就是你们的不是了，在下认为，他把盾牌挂在这里，不日即回，待他回来，教众骑士与之马上比武，岂不比此举更能为尔等添彩；眼见骑士盾牌受此侮辱，吾再也无法袖手旁观。’随之，尤文爵士和高文爵士策马离去，行不多远，但见马霍斯爵士骑着高头大马，直奔他们而来。那十二名少女一见马霍斯爵士便乱作一团，逃进了塔楼，有几个路上还摔倒了。一位塔楼骑士见状，举起盾牌，高声喝道：‘马霍斯爵士，接招吧。’于是二人策马而来战在一起，那骑士对着马霍斯一枪刺去，长矛断作两截，而马霍斯爵士则朝他猛地一击，打断了他的脖颈，连同马背——”","“—for I saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were gathered, and that time there might no man withstand him.Ah, said Sir Gawaine, damsels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom, and then may those knights match him on horseback, and that is more your worship than thus; for I will abide no longer to see a knight’s shield dishonored.And therewith Sir Uwaine and Sir Gawaine departed a little from them, and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them.And when the twelve damsels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild, so that some of them fell by the way. Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield, and said on high, Sir Marhaus defend thee.And so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus, and Sir Marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse’s back—”"
"“唉，这事儿真是不好，毁了多少马匹啊。”","“Well, that is just the trouble about this state of things, it ruins so many horses.”"
"“另一位塔楼骑士一见之下，直取马霍斯，二人战作一团，转眼间塔楼骑士又被击下马来，连人带马，直挺挺死掉——”","“That saw the other knight of the turret, and dressed him toward Marhaus, and they went so eagerly together, that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down, horse and man, stark dead—”"
"“又一匹马死了，我跟你说，这个风俗早就该破除了。我不懂，但凡是有点感情的人，怎么会为此鼓掌喝彩，支持赞成。”","“ANOTHER horse gone; I tell you it is a custom that ought to be broken up. I don’t see how people with any feeling can applaud and support it.”"
"……","...."
"“于是这两位骑士飞也似一起赶上前来——”","“So these two knights came together with great random—”"
"我明白，自己刚才睡着了，错过了一章，但我没吱声。我推断这次该轮到那位爱尔兰骑士与两位客人打起来了，事情果真如此。","I saw that I had been asleep and missed a chapter, but I didn’t say anything.I judged that the Irish knight was in trouble with the visitors by this time, and this turned out to be the case."
"“——尤文爵士朝马霍斯爵士挺枪刺去，长矛刺在盾牌上，断为两截，而马霍斯爵士也拼命朝他刺去，连人带马撅倒在地，伤了尤文爵士左肋——”","“—that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth, and hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side—"
"“说真的，阿丽桑德，这些古香古色的词也太简单了点，词汇也太有限了，结果呢，描述就缺乏变化了；这些词用得太频繁了，结果就如撒哈拉大沙漠般枯燥无味，缺乏生动细腻的描述，这就使人有单调乏味的感觉。事实上所有的战争都差不多：老是二人飞也似的策马而战——‘飞也似’是个好词，这么说来‘诠释’也是个好词，还有‘燔祭’，‘盗用公款’，‘用益权’，还有百十个其他的好词，可是，天呐！总该有点区分吧——他们飞也似的战作一团，一支长矛折断，一方的盾牌被刺破，另一方连人带马被打倒在地，倒在马后，折断了脖子，接着下一位候补人又飞也似地直奔过来，折断了长矛，另一位盾牌被刺破，然后也连人带马被打倒在地，倒在马后，折断了脖子，随后又挑一个上来，一个接着一个，直到嘴里的材料通通用完为止；而当你统计战果的时候，根本就分不清哪场战斗是哪场，分不清谁输谁赢；还说描绘出了活生生的，狂风暴雨般的，吼声震天的战斗，切！嗨，那么苍白无力，连一点声响都没有——只不过是些鬼影在雾里扭来打去。","“The truth is, Alisande, these archaics are a little TOO simple; the vocabulary is too limited, and so, by consequence, descriptions suffer in the matter of variety; they run too much to level Saharas of fact, and not enough to picturesque detail; this throws about them a certain air of the monotonous; in fact the fights are all alike: a couple of people come together with great random—random is a good word, and so is exegesis, for that matter, and so is holocaust, and defalcation, and usufruct and a hundred others, but land! a body ought to discriminate—they come together with great random, and a spear is brast, and one party brake his shield and the other one goes down, horse and man, over his horse-tail and brake his neck, and then the next candidate comes randoming in, and brast HIS spear, and the other man brast his shield, and down HE goes, horse and man, over his horse-tail, and brake HIS neck, and then there’s another elected, and another and another and still another, till the material is all used up; and when you come to figure up results, you can’t tell one fight from another, nor who whipped; and as a PICTURE, of living, raging, roaring battle, sho! why, it’s pale and noiseless—just ghosts scuffling in a fog."
"我的妈呀，就算是最壮观的场面，用这些贫乏的词汇又能描述出什么名堂来——就拿尼禄时代火烧罗马这个例子来说吧。哼，那还不说成是，‘城烧毁了；没有保险；孩子打破了窗户，消防员折断了脖子！’　哼，这可不能算是生动的描绘！”","Dear me, what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest spectacle?—the burning of Rome in Nero’s time, for instance?Why, it would merely say,‘Town burned down; no insurance; boy brast a window, fireman brake his neck!’ Why, THAT ain’t a picture!”"
"我以为这次算是好好给桑迪上了一课，谁知压根就没触动她，连根羽毛都没动。我刚把盖子揭开，她的蒸汽就又源源不断地往外冒了：","It was a good deal of a lecture, I thought, but it didn’t disturb Sandy, didn’t turn a feather; her steam soared steadily up again, the minute I took off the lid:"
"“然后，马霍斯爵士掉转马头，手执长矛朝着高文爵士冲去。高文爵士见此情形，也举盾迎上，二人各自挺起长矛，纵马相交，奋力刺向彼此的盾牌，可是，高文爵士的长矛折断了——”","“Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with his spear.And when Sir Gawaine saw that, he dressed his shield, and they aventred their spears, and they came together with all the might of their horses, that either knight smote other so hard in the midst of their shields, but Sir Gawaine’s spear brake—”"
"“我就知道会这样。”","“I knew it would.”"
"“——不过，马霍斯爵士仍是握矛在手；高文爵士随即连人带马滚落在地——”","“—but Sir Marhaus’s spear held; and therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth—”"
"“就是这样——还摔断了脊柱。”——“高文爵士挺身而起，拔出剑来，徒步直取马霍斯爵士，二人又奋起激战，挥剑猛砍，盾牌碎成片片，四处乱飞，头盔和锁子甲也都破损了，两人都挂了彩。但是从九点之后，三个小时过去了，高文爵士却越战越勇。他的力气增长了三倍之多。马霍斯爵士一切都看在眼里，不禁诧异为何他的气力还能增长，苦战良久，两人都身受重伤，接着等到时近正午——”","“Just so—and brake his back.?—“and lightly Sir Gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out his sword, and dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and therewith either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their swords, that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and their hauberks, and wounded either other.But Sir Gawaine, fro it passed nine of the clock, waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and stronger.And thrice his might was increased.All this espied Sir Marhaus, and had great wonder how his might increased, and so they wounded other passing sore; and then when it was come noon—”"
"她声调平缓单调，如雨打芭蕉，将我童年时的景象和声音带上前来：","The pelting sing-song of it carried me forward to scenes and sounds of my boyhood days:"
"“纽——黑文——到了！停车休息十分钟——列车员提前两分钟打铃上车——去滨海线旅行的旅客请上后面那辆车，这辆不往前开了——苹——果，橘子，香蕉，三——明治，爆——米花咧！”——“过了响午，已近黄昏。","“N-e-e-ew Haven! ten minutes for refreshments—knductr’ll strike the gong-bell two minutes before train leaves—passengers for the Shore line please take seats in the rear k’yar, this k’yar don’t go no furder—AHH pls, AW-rnjz, b‘NANners, S-A-N-D’ches, p—OP-corn!?—“and waxed past noon and drew toward evensong."
"高文爵士气力衰退，渐渐变得虚弱，力不能支，而马霍斯爵士却越战越强——”","Sir Gawaine’s strength feebled and waxed passing faint, that unnethes he might dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger—”"
"“当然，那还不得把铠甲撑破啦；不过那班人是不会把这种小事放在心上的。”——“于是，马霍斯爵士说道：‘这位骑士，与阁下厮杀半日，得知阁下武艺端的了得，力气盈满时无人能出其右；你我之争乃为区区小事，况吾觉察阁下气力渐衰，若为此伤你岂非憾事？’‘啊，’高文爵士回道，‘尊贵的骑士，足下之言恰如出自吾口。’于是二人摘下头盔，互吻一下，并立誓以后亲如兄弟，情同手足——”","“Which strained his armor, of course; and yet little would one of these people mind a small thing like that.?—“and so, Sir Knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well felt that ye are a passing good knight, and a marvelous man of might as ever I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and therefore it were a pity to do you hurt, for I feel you are passing feeble.Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word that I should say.And therewith they took off their helms and either kissed other, and there they swore together either to love other as brethren—”"
"但是到了这儿我没跟上故事的线索，打着盹儿要睡过去了，心里还想着像这样孔武有力的人，穿着极其沉重的铁衣，大汗淋漓，还能站立着，向对方一连猛砍猛打六个小时，真是力大无比——可惜他们生不逢时，不能用这力气干点有用的事情。就拿叫驴来说吧：叫驴也有那么大的力气，而且用它来干点有益的事情，因此对这世界来讲它是有价值的，也因为它就是头叫驴；但是一个贵族可不能因为是头叫驴而有价值。这两样东西搅在一起可不怎么样，而且你首先就不该有这样的想法。然而，错误一旦开了头，麻烦可就落下了，你根本就不会知道能惹出什么事来。","But I lost the thread there, and dozed off to slumber, thinking about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength—strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration, and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretch—should not have been born at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose.Take a jackass, for instance: a jackass has that kind of strength, and puts it to a useful purpose, and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass.It is a mixture that is always ineffectual, and should never have been attempted in the first place.And yet, once you start a mistake, the trouble is done and you never know what is going to come of it."
"当我再次醒来开始听的时候，我发现又漏听了一章，阿丽桑德已经跟她的那些人物不知道跑到哪里去了。","When I came to myself again and began to listen, I perceived that I had lost another chapter, and that Alisande had wandered a long way off with her people."
"“于是，他们骑着马来到一片山石遍立的山谷，山谷近旁有一条清澈的小溪，山谷尽头乃是小溪之源，好一池泉水，泉水旁坐着三位少女。‘在这个国家，’马霍斯爵士说道，‘自国人皈依基督教以来，凡有骑士来此，定有一番奇遇——’”","“And so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones, and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was the head of the stream, a fair fountain, and three damsels sitting thereby.In this country, said Sir Marhaus, came never knight since it was christened, but he found strange adventures—”"
"“这样说不好，阿丽桑德。马霍斯爵士，作为爱尔兰王之子，说起话来怎么和其他人别无二致；你应该给他弄点土腔土调，至少整点口头禅什么的；这样一来只要他一开口，不用提名道姓的，人家也能认出他来了。大文豪都使用这种文学手段。你该让他说，‘在这个国家，叽里咕噜，自国人皈依基督教以来，凡有骑士来此，定有奇遇，叽里咕噜。’　","“This is not good form, Alisande.Sir Marhaus the king’s son of Ireland talks like all the rest; you ought to give him a brogue, or at least a characteristic expletive; by this means one would recognize him as soon as he spoke, without his ever being named.It is a common literary device with the great authors.You should make him say, ‘In this country, be jabers, came never knight since it was christened, but he found strange adventures, be jabers.’"
"你瞧这样听起来就好多了。”——“凡有骑士来此，定有奇遇，叽里咕噜。还真是那么回事，我的大人，尽管说起来有点费劲，不过或许多说几遍就不会这么结结巴巴了，会越说越顺溜的。接着他们骑着马朝那三位少女走去，互相行礼问候，年纪最大的那位少女头戴黄金花冠，在人世度过了六十余载——”","You see how much better that sounds.”—“came never knight but he found strange adventures, be jabers.Of a truth it doth indeed, fair lord, albeit ’tis passing hard to say, though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed with usage.And then they rode to the damsels, and either saluted other, and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head, and she was threescore winter of age or more—”"
"“那位‘少女’？”","“The DAMSEL was?”"
"“即便如此，大人——她花冠下白发苍苍——”","“Even so, dear lord—and her hair was white under the garland—”"
"“肯定还有满嘴赛璐珞的假牙，九块钱一副——松垮垮的那种，吃起东西来上下活动，跟吊闸似的，大笑时还会掉下来。”","“Celluloid teeth, nine dollars a set, as like as not—the loose-fit kind, that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat, and fall out when you laugh.”"
"“第二位少女三十左右年纪，头戴纤巧的金环。第三位少女年方十五——”","“The second damsel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold about her head.The third damsel was but fifteen year of age—”"
"一时间万千思绪如波涛般涌上我的心头，耳边的话语渐渐都听不到了！","Billows of thought came rolling over my soul, and the voice faded out of my hearing!"
"十五岁！碎了——我的心！噢，我那不见了的心肝儿！正是这般年纪, 温柔又可爱, 她是我的全部, 但我却再也见不到她了！一想到她，我的记忆就如同穿越过茫茫大海，来到好多好多世纪之后，那模糊的时代，那欢乐的时代，在夏日的清晨，风和日丽，我刚刚告别了充满她甜美倩影的梦境，一觉醒来，就喊一声：“喂，总机！”就为了听她用那可爱的嗓音令人消魂地回我一声：“喂，汉克！”这对于我那着魔的耳朵来讲无异于天籁之音。　她一周能赚到三块钱，她也确实值那些钱。","Fifteen!Break—my heart!oh, my lost darling!Just her age who was so gentle, and lovely, and all the world to me, and whom I shall never see again!How the thought of her carries me back over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time, a happy time, so many, many centuries hence, when I used to wake in the soft summer mornings, out of sweet dreams of her, and say “Hello, Central!” just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a “Hello, Hank!” that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear. 　She got three dollars a week, but she was worth it."
"此时阿丽桑德再怎么解释我们俘虏的那些骑士是何许人，我也听不进去了——我是说万一她还能解释一下的话。我已经兴趣全无，心不在焉，愁绪满怀。　桑迪讲述的故事在我耳边飘过，我偶尔听听，只抓住了只言片语，只是模模糊糊注意到，那三位骑士一人一个将那三位少女抱上马来，放在身后，一位骑着马向北走，一位向东，还有一位向南去了，去寻找奇遇去了，等过了一年零一天，再次相聚，大扯其谎。一年零一天——没有行李。这个国家的民风是多么淳朴，由此可见一斑。","I could not follow Alisande’s further explanation of who our captured knights were, now—I mean in case she should ever get to explaining who they were.My interest was gone, my thoughts were far away, and sad. 　By fitful glimpses of the drifting tale, caught here and there and now and then, I merely noted in a vague way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels up behind him on his horse, and one rode north, another east, the other south, to seek adventures, and meet again and lie, after year and day.Year and day—and without baggage.It was of a piece with the general simplicity of the country."
"此时太阳就要落山了，下午三点左右阿丽桑德就开始跟我讲那些牛仔是谁了，因此讲到现在她的故事有了很大的进展——对她而言不小了。毫无疑问她迟早都会讲完，不过她这人可是催不得。","The sun was now setting.It was about three in the afternoon when Alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were; so she had made pretty good progress with it—for her.She would arrive some time or other, no doubt, but she was not a person who could be hurried."
"我们走近了一座矗立在高坡上的城堡，这座建筑巨大而坚固，有年头了，灰色的塔楼和女墙上都爬满了常青藤，整个宏伟的建筑都沐浴在落日的余辉下，通体辉煌。这么大的城堡我们还是头一遭见到，我想这就是我们要找的那座吧，但是桑迪却说不是。　她也不清楚谁是城堡的主人，她说自己以前去卡米洛的时候曾经经过这里，但是没有进去拜访。","We were approaching a castle which stood on high ground; a huge, strong, venerable structure, whose gray towers and battlements were charmingly draped with ivy, and whose whole majestic mass was drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun. 　It was the largest castle we had seen, and so I thought it might be the one we were after, but Sandy said no.　She did not know who owned it; she said she had passed it without calling, when she went down to Camelot."
"第十六章　小仙女嫫干","CHAPTER 16 Morgan Le Fay"
"如果你相信游侠骑士的话，那么并不是所有的城堡都适合借宿歇脚的。而事实上，游侠骑士根本就不是值得信赖的人——要是照现在的标准来衡量的话；然而，要照他们自己时代的标准衡量，再适当增减，你就得到了真相。方法很简单：把他们的话打个折扣，扣除百分之九十七，剩下的即为事实。现在打这个折扣之后，剩下的事实就是，在摁门铃之前——我的意思是在招呼门卫之前，我要是能先打听打听城堡的情况，那才是明智之举。　因此当我看到有人正骑着马从城堡蜿蜒而下的那条路上拐最后一个弯时，我高兴坏了。","IF knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable places to seek hospitality in.As a matter of fact, knights errant were NOT persons to be believed—that is, measured by modern standards of veracity; yet, measured by the standards of their own time, and scaled accordingly, you got the truth.It was very simple: you discounted a statement ninetyseven percent; the rest was fact.Now after making this allowance, the truth remained that if I could find out something about a castle before ringing the doorbell—I mean hailing the warders—it was the sensible thing to do.　So I was pleased when I saw in the distance a horseman making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle."
"当我们来到彼此跟前时，我才看到他戴着一顶插有羽毛的头盔，也穿着铁甲，但似乎有点不太一样，还带着个额外的稀奇古怪的东西——一件硬硬的方方正正的衣服，就好像传令官的官服一样。可是，当我走近了，却不由得笑自己太健忘了，但见他官服上写着这样一条标语：","As we approached each other, I saw that he wore a plumed helmet, and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel, but bore a curious addition also—a stiff square garment like a herald’s tabard.However, I had to smile at my own forgetfulness when I got nearer and read this sign on his tabard:"
"“泼西蒙氏肥皂——名士之选。”","“Persimmon’s Soap—All the Prime-Donna Use It.”"
"这是我自己想出来的一个小点子，此举对于开化和提高整个国民素质有着几大好处。首先，这可以偷偷地，暗中打击那可笑的游侠骑士之风，尽管除了我之外没人质疑这点。　我已经派出了不少这样的人——都是我能物色到的最勇敢的骑士——每位都像块三明治似的夹在两块这样或那样的广告牌间，我断定等他们的数量渐渐达到一定程度，一定会显得很可笑；然后，那些光穿着铁甲，没夹广告牌的傻瓜就会开始显得可笑了，因为他已经落伍了。","That was a little idea of my own, and had several wholesome purposes in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation.In the first place, it was a furtive, underhand blow at this nonsense of knight errantry, though nobody suspected that but me. 　I had started a number of these people out—the bravest knights I could get—each sandwiched between bulletin-boards bearing one device or another, and I judged that by and by when they got to be numerous enough they would begin to look ridiculous; and then, even the steel-clad ass that HADN’T any board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he was out of the fashion."
"其次，这些文明传播者会逐步在贵族中间养成基本的卫生习惯，而又不引起怀疑或者恐慌，然后只要牧师能够保持缄默，就从贵族开始推广到平民。这样一来就会削弱教会的力量。我的意思是，会朝着这个方向迈进。接下来就是教育了——然后是自由——那时教会就该垮掉了。我坚信任何国立的教会都是一桩国立的罪恶，一个国立的奴隶牢圈，因此我毫不犹豫，愿意采取一切能伤害到它的方法和武器来攻击它。唉，想当年——在仍孕育在时间长河的那些遥远的世纪里——有些英国人总以为他们出生在一个自由的国度里，一个“自治体法案”和“宣誓法案”仍在实施的“自由”国度——这两个法案剥夺了人民的自由，玷污了人民的良心，撑起了一个国立的谬误时代。","Secondly, these missionaries would gradually, and without creating suspicion or exciting alarm, introduce a rudimentary cleanliness among the nobility, and from them it would work down to the people, if the priests could be kept quiet.This would undermine the Church.I mean would be a step toward that.Next, education—next, freedom—and then she would begin to crumble.It being my conviction that any Established Church is an established crime, an established slave-pen, I had no scruples, but was willing to assail it in any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it.Why, in my own former day—in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of time—there were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free country: a “free” country with the Corporation Act and the Test still in force in it—timbers propped against men’s liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an Established Anachronism with."
"我的那些文明传播者都经过训练，知道如何拼写他们官服上的金字——弄得金碧辉煌是个妙招，我可以让国王也穿上这么一块广告牌，就凭它那俗里俗气、金光闪闪的劲儿——他们会把这些广告念出来，然后给那些贵族男女解释肥皂是什么东西；如果那些贵族男女还是害怕，就先让他们在狗身上试试。 下一步文明传播者们要做的就是把贵族一家老小都请出来，然后在自己身上做试验；他什么试验都得做，无论这试验多么疯狂。只要能让那些贵族相信肥皂没有害处就行；如果贵族们到了最后还是不太相信，使者就得去抓个隐士来——树林里有的是，他们管自个儿叫“圣徒”，大家也的确相信他们就是圣徒。 他们神圣得难以言表，会各种法术，人人见了都敬畏三分。如果隐士洗完了也没死，可是公爵还是不能相信，那就放弃他吧，随他去好了。","My missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their tabards—the showy gilding was a neat idea, I could have got the king to wear a bulletin-board for the sake of that barbaric splendor—they were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies what soap was; and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it, get them to try it on a dog.  The missionary’s next move was to get the family together and try it on himself; he was to stop at no experiment, however desperate.That could convince the nobility that soap was harmless; if any final doubt remained, he must catch a hermit—the woods were full of them; saints they called themselves, and saints they were believed to be.  They were unspeakably holy, and worked miracles, and everybody stood in awe of them.If a hermit could survive a wash, and that failed to convince a duke, give him up, let him alone."
"每当我的文明传播者在路上征服了一位游侠骑士，他们就给他洗一番，等到他好了以后，就让他发誓，也去弄一块广告牌，余生也将以传播推广肥皂和文明为己任。结果呢，这个行业的从业人员逐渐增多了，改革也稳步推广开来。我的肥皂工厂老早就感到生产压力了。起初我只有两个人手，但在我出门之前已经雇了十五个人了，还得夜以继日地干；这对大气环境造成的影响是如此显著以至国王走路时老是要晕倒，喘不上气来，还说他觉得自己再也撑不下去了，而兰斯洛特爵士则熏得几乎什么事也不能做，只能在房顶走来走去，骂骂咧咧，尽管我告诉过他在那上面空气比哪儿都糟，但他非说他要多呼吸点空气；他还总抱怨说无论如何王宫也不是开肥皂厂的地方，还说要是有人胆敢在他家开一个，他要是不把那人勒死，就是狗娘养的。当时还有女士在场呢，但这些人可不在乎这个。当工厂开工，风朝着他们的方向刮时，他们当着孩子的面也骂骂咧咧的。","Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road they washed him, and when he got well they swore him to go and get a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest of his days.As a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading.My soap factory felt the strain early.At first I had only two hands; but before I had left home I was already employing fifteen, and running night and day; and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer, and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up and down the roof and swear, although I told him it was worse up there than anywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house he would be damned if he wouldn’t strangle him.There were ladies present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory was going."
"这位充当文明传播者的骑士名叫拉科特·马勒·泰勒，他说城堡里住着亚瑟王的妹妹，也就是攸连斯王的妻子，小仙女嫫干。这位国王手里的领土大小只相当于哥伦比亚区大小——你站在中间能把砖头扔到邻国去。“国王”和“王国”在英国遍地都是，就跟约书亚时代小小的巴勒斯坦一样，人们必须睡觉时必须得蜷起膝盖，因为一伸腿就得用护照了。","This missionary knight’s name was La Cote Male Taile, and he said that this castle was the abode of Morgan le Fay, sister of King Arthur, and wife of King Uriens.Monarch of a realm about as big as the District of Columbia—you could stand in the middle of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom.“Kings” and “Kingdoms” were as thick in Britain as they had been in little Palestine in Joshua’s time, when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up because they couldn’t stretch out without a passport."
"拉科特非常沮丧，因为这是他从事推广活动以来最失败的一次。他一块也没卖出去，可是这行所有的招他都尝试过了，甚至连隐士都洗了，可是，隐士死掉了。这真是失败透顶了，因为那个畜生这样以来就会被追加为殉道者，会在罗马圣徒名册上占一席之地了。所以可怜的拉科特·马勒·泰勒爵士为此叫苦连天，悲痛万分。这么一来我也心如刀割，不由得对他好言相劝。因此我说道：","La Cote was much depressed, for he had scored here the worst failure of his campaign.He had not worked off a cake; yet he had tried all the tricks of the trade, even to the washing of a hermit; but the hermit died.This was, indeed, a bad failure, for this animal would now be dubbed a martyr, and would take his place among the saints of the Roman calendar.Thus made he his moan, this poor Sir La Cote Male Taile, and sorrowed passing sore.And so my heart bled for him, and I was moved to comfort and stay him.Wherefore I said:"
"“请勿烦恼，骑士阁下，这算不上什么失败。你和我都是有脑子的人，对于有脑子的人来说没有失败只有成功。瞧瞧咱们是如何将这个表面上的灾难变成一则广告的吧，变成推广我们肥皂的广告，还要做成别人想都没想过的最大的广告，这个广告会把华盛顿山的失败变成马特峰的胜利。我们还要在你的广告牌上写上‘上帝选民之选’几个字。你觉得这主意怎么样？”","“Forbear to grieve, fair knight, for this is not a defeat.We have brains, you and I; and for such as have brains there are no defeats, but only victories.Observe how we will turn this seeming disaster into an advertisement; an advertisement for our soap; and the biggest one, to draw, that was ever thought of; an advertisement that will transform that Mount Washington defeat into a Matterhorn victory.We will put on your bulletin-board, ‘PATRONIZED BY THE ELECT.’ How does that strike you?”"
"“妙哉！此计甚妙！”","“Verily, it is wonderly bethought!”"
"“嘿, 就简简单单加这么一小行广告词, 任谁见了都得承认绝了。”","“Well, a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little one-line ad., it’s a corker.”"
"于是这个可怜的文明传播者顿时愁云一扫而光。这家伙还是很勇敢的，想当年也曾屡建奇功。他之所以远近闻名，主要是因为像我这次一样，出了几次远门，经历了些事情，有一次还带了位少女一起出行，那位少女名叫马尔迪莎，舌头和桑迪一样好使，尽管讲话内容不太一样，因为她舌头搅来搅去净说些辱骂人的话，而桑迪的音乐则要柔和得多。我很熟悉拉科特的事，因此当他跟我告别时脸上露出同情的神色，我可都看懂了。他猜想我正处于水深火热之中呢。","So the poor colporteur’s griefs vanished away.He was a brave fellow, and had done mighty feats of arms in his time.His chief celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one of mine, which he had once made with a damsel named Maledisant, who was as handy with her tongue as was Sandy, though in a different way, for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult, whereas Sandy’s music was of a kindlier sort.I knew his story well, and so I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell.He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it."
"我和桑迪一边骑马往前走，一边讨论他的事情，桑迪说拉科特打那次旅行一开头就开始走霉运了，头一天国王的弄臣就把他打翻在地，这种情况下按照惯例姑娘肯定会跟获胜一方跑掉，但是马尔迪莎却没这么做，后来无论哪次拉科特输了，她都始终坚定不移地跟着他。“不过，”我说，“要是胜利者拒绝接受他的战利品呢？”桑迪说那可不行——他非要不可。他不能拒绝；这不合规矩。我记下了这点。如果哪回桑迪的音乐太招人烦了，我就让个骑士把我打败，好让桑迪跟他跑掉。","Sandy and I discussed his story, as we rode along, and she said that La Cote’s bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that trip; for the king’s fool had overthrown him on the first day, and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the conqueror, but Maledisant didn’t do it; and also persisted afterward in sticking to him, after all his defeats.But, said I, suppose the victor should decline to accept his spoil?She said that that wouldn’t answer—he must.He couldn’t decline; it wouldn’t be regular.I made a note of that.If Sandy’s music got to be too burdensome, some time, I would let a knight defeat me, on the chance that she would desert to him."
"到了城堡墙下，守在城墙上的卫兵盘问了我们一会儿，经过一番会谈把我们放进去了。对于那次造访我没什么高兴的事可讲。不过，也算不上令人失望，因为我久闻小仙女大名，压根儿就没指望能碰上什么高兴事。全国上下没有不怕她的，因为她早已让大家都相信她是一个神通广大的女巫。她手段歹毒，蛇蝎心肠。她满肚子坏水，连眼皮上都溢出来了。她的过去黑压压的全是罪恶，在她的诸多罪恶中，杀人乃是家常便饭。我最巴不得见的人就是她了，就是见撒旦也不过如此好奇。出乎意料的是，她居然是个美人。黑心眼并没有使她的表情令人憎恶，岁月也没有在她那绸缎般的肌肤上留下皱纹，她的肌肤依然如花蕊初绽，没有受到一丝损害。她简直可以当老攸连斯国王的孙女了，或者被人误认为是自己儿子的姐妹。","In due time we were challenged by the warders, from the castle walls, and after a parley admitted.I have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit.But it was not a disappointment, for I knew Mrs. le Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant.She was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody believe she was a great sorceress.All her ways were wicked, all her instincts devilish.She was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice.All her history was black with crime; and among her crimes murder was common.I was most curious to see her; as curious as I could have been to see Satan.To my surprise she was beautiful; black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive, age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness.She could have passed for old Uriens’ granddaughter, she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son."
"我们刚走进城堡的大门，就有人命令我们去晋见王后。攸连斯国王也在场，他是个慈眉善目的老头，还有点低眉顺眼的。他的儿子，白手的攸文爵士也在，我对他当然很感兴趣，因为他曾与三十位骑士交过手，还跟高文爵士和马霍斯爵士一同闯荡过，这事桑迪跟我唠唠叨叨地讲过。不过小仙女嫫干才是大家关注的焦点，才是最出众的人物，很显而易见，她才是一家之主。她招呼我们就座后，就开始风度优雅，温柔大方地询问起我问题来。天啊，她讲起话来犹如鸟儿在歌唱，又如笛子或别的什么乐器在吹弹。我此时相信有关这个女人的事情都是误传，或是胡编乱造。她如鸟儿呢喃般说着，说着，正在这时一位英俊的年轻侍从，身穿彩虹般斑斓的衣服，举止从容不迫，波澜不惊，用托盘托着东西走上前来跪倒，正要把东西呈给王后，结果优雅摆过了头，失去平衡摔倒了，轻微碰到了王后的膝盖。她将一柄短剑插进他的身体，不动声色，就好像别人用叉子叉老鼠一样。","As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence.King Uriens was there, a kind-faced old man with a subdued look; and also the son, Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, in whom I was, of course, interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights, and also on account of his trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus, which Sandy had been aging me with.But Morgan was the main attraction, the conspicuous personality here; she was head chief of this household, that was plain.She caused us to be seated, and then she began, with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses, to ask me questions.Dear me, it was like a bird or a flute, or something, talking.I felt persuaded that this woman must have been misrepresented, lied about.She trilled along, and trilled along, and presently a handsome young page, clothed like the rainbow, and as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave, came with something on a golden salver, and, kneeling to present it to her, overdid his graces and lost his balance, and so fell lightly against her knee.She slipped a dirk into him in as matter-of-course a way as another person would have harpooned a rat!"
"可怜的孩子！他砰然倒地，裹着凌罗绸缎的四肢蜷成一团，痛苦地抽搐了几下，就死掉了。老国王见此情形，心生恻隐，不禁“啊呀”一声。可是一瞥见王后的脸色，他就猛地打住，活生生将后半截感叹咽了回去。攸文爵士在母亲的示意下，到前厅喊了几个下人，而与此同时这位夫人还继续用泉水叮咚般动听的声音讲着话。","Poor child! he slumped to the floor, twisted his silken limbs in one great straining contortion of pain, and was dead.Out of the old king was wrung an involuntary “O-h!” of compassion.The look he got, made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens in it.Sir Uwaine, at a sign from his mother, went to the anteroom and called some servants, and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly along with her talk."
"我看得出来她是个好主妇，因为她在说话时还用眼角瞄着那些下人，怕他们在挪动那具尸体好抬出去的时候出什么岔子。他们拿来几块干净的毛巾，她又让他们去换别的来。当他们擦完地板要出去时，她指着地上眼泪那么大的一小块红色斑点，说他们眼睛不管用，给漏掉了。很显然，拉科特·马勒·泰勒肯定没看到这家的女主人。通常，摆在人们面前的证据虽然不会说话，但声音却比任何会说话的舌头都要响亮清晰。","I saw that she was a good housekeeper, for while she talked she kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made no balks in handling the body and getting it out; when they came with fresh clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and when they had finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked.It was plain to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed to see the mistress of the house.Often, how louder and clearer than any tongue, does dumb circumstantial evidence speak."
"小仙女嫫干还在用她那音乐般动听的声音讲着话。她真是位了不起的女人。她的目光是多么犀利啊，那责备的目光往那些下人身上一扫，他们就吓得畏畏缩缩，就好像胆小的人见到云层里打出的闪电一样。换做是我，我也会养成这种习惯。那位可怜的攸连斯老哥也是如此，他总是这么提心吊胆，甚至夫人还没朝他转过身来他就吓得往后退了。","Morgan le Fay rippled along as musically as ever.Marvelous woman.And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the lightning flashes out of a cloud.I could have got the habit myself.It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he was always on the ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn toward him but he winced."
"谈着谈着，我就忘了这个女人有多恨她哥哥了，竟然说了一句称赞亚瑟王的话。这一句称赞的话就够了。她脸上马上乌云密布，就如暴风雨要来的架势。她喊来卫兵，说道：","In the midst of the talk I let drop a complimentary word about King Arthur, forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her brother.That one little compliment was enough.She clouded up like storm; she called for her guards, and said:"
"“将这两个贼子打入地牢。”","“Hale me these varlets to the dungeons.”"
"一听这话，我耳朵都凉了，因为她的地牢早已名声在外。我想不出该说点或做点什么。　但桑迪可不一样。就在卫兵把手放在我身上的一刹那，她泰然自若，不慌不忙地说道：","That struck cold on my ears, for her dungeons had a reputation.Nothing occurred to me to say—or do. 　But not so with Sandy.As the guard laid a hand upon me, she piped up with the tranquilest confidence, and said:"
"“苍天在上，汝等疯汉莫非要自取灭亡不成？这位是我们的‘头子’！”","“God’s wounds, dost thou covet destruction, thou maniac?It is The Boss!”"
"瞧这主意多妙！还非常简单，但我永远也想不出这样的点子来。　我生来就很谦虚，尽管不是事事如此，但有些方面是这样，这次就是其中之一。","Now what a happy idea that was!—and so simple; yet it would never have occurred to me. 　I was born modest; not all over, but in spots; and this was one of the spots."
"夫人一听此言，如同遭了电击一般。她马上多云转晴，满脸堆笑，刚才那种迷人的优雅和殷勤劲儿又回来了。可是她无论如何也掩盖不住这个事实，她已吓得魂飞魄散了。她说：","The effect upon madame was electrical.It cleared her countenance and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and blandishments; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright.She said:"
"“啊呀，您的侍女怎恁地说话！如您这般神通广大，制服了默林的人，我这等法力平平之人怎敢如此放肆，勿要玩笑了。我掐指一算，料到阁下即将大驾光临，方才您刚进得门来，我便知是您不假。吾施此雕虫小技，只为引得大人您一惊之下大显神通，必将发出神火烧死那些卫兵，将他们当场化为灰烬，这等神通吾等望尘莫及，然吾童心未泯，悬望已久，但求一窥。”","“La, but do list to thine handmaid! as if one gifted with powers like to mine might say the thing which I have said unto one who has vanquished Merlin, and not be jesting.By mine enchantments I foresaw your coming, and by them I knew you when you entered here.I did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you into some display of your art, as not doubting you would blast the guards with occult fires, consuming them to ashes on the spot, a marvel much beyond mine own ability, yet one which I have long been childishly curious to see.”"
"那些卫兵可没那么好奇，一得到准许马上就退了出去。","The guards were less curious, and got out as soon as they got permission."
"第十七章　御宴","CHAPTER 17 A Royal Banquet"
"那位夫人见我心平气和，毫无怨愤，便确定我已被她那番话支吾过去了。她的恐惧劲儿一过，就得寸进尺地要求我展示一下魔法，杀个把人给她瞧瞧，这事可让我为了难。不过，很快就有人来请我们去做祷告，这下才给我解了围。这里我得为那些贵族说句话：尽管他们残暴不仁，杀人掳掠，道德败坏，可是对于宗教却是笃信不疑，虔诚之至。对于教会规定的种种仪式，他们总是按部就班、坚定不移地完成，没有什么事情能扰乱他们。我不止一次看到，一个贵族已经将敌人制服了，却还要停下来先祷告一番再割断敌人的喉咙。我还不止一次看到一个贵族伏击并杀死了敌人，连尸体上的东西都等不及拿，就退到离路边最近的神龛去，毕恭毕敬地感谢上帝去了。即使是一千年以后那位强硬的圣徒，班维努图·切利尼，终其一生也没做出比这更漂亮更可爱的事来。不列颠所有的贵族，连同他们的家人，一早一晚都要到他们自家的小礼拜堂做两回礼拜，更有甚者，除此之外还在家一天另做五六回礼拜。这应该完全归功于教会。尽管我对天主教会没什么好感，可是还是得承认这点。而且，我发现自己经常会不知不觉地说：“要是这个国家没有教会会成个什么样子？”","MADAME, seeing me pacific and unresentful, no doubt judged that I was deceived by her excuse; for her fright dissolved away, and she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill somebody, that the thing grew to be embarrassing.However, to my relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers.I will say this much for the nobility: that, tyrannical, murderous, rapacious, and morally rotten as they were, they were deeply and enthusiastically religious.Nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the Church.More than once I had seen a noble who had gotten his enemy at a disadvantage, stop to pray before cutting his throat; more than once I had seen a noble, after ambushing and despatching his enemy, retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give thanks, without even waiting to rob the body.There was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even Benvenuto Cellini, that rough-hewn saint, ten centuries later.All the nobles of Britain, with their families, attended divine service morning and night daily, in their private chapels, and even the worst of them had family worship five or six times a day besides.The credit of this belonged entirely to the Church.Although I was no friend to that Catholic Church, I was obliged to admit this.And often, in spite of me, I found myself saying, “What would this country be without the Church?”"
"祷告之后我们来到一处大宴会厅用餐，树百盏油灯把大厅照得灯火通明，厅内之物无不精美绝伦，华美奢侈，富丽堂皇，以求与主人的皇室风范相称。在大厅尽头的高台上，摆放着国王与王后，还有他们的儿子攸文王子的餐桌。从这里往外，大厅的地上摆放着大家用餐的餐桌。这张餐桌上，坐上首的是来访的贵族及他们已成年的家眷，男女都有——其实就是常驻的朝臣——共有六十一人；坐在下首的是王室的小官和他们主要的下属：共有一百一十八人，差不多还有同样数目的穿制服的仆人站在他们的椅子后面，伺候这个伺候那个。那场面可真够壮观的。走廊里有支乐队，敲钹的敲钹，吹号的吹号，弹竖琴的弹竖琴，还有种种别的恐怖玩意，它们的演奏宣告了用餐的开始；几百年后有支哀号般的曲子叫“在那甜美的未来”，他们演奏的音乐就好像是这支曲子的初稿，或是开始的那段痛苦哀号。　不过这是新曲子，还应该再彩排几次。不知因为什么缘故，在用餐后王后命人将这曲子的作曲家绞死了。","After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was lighted by hundreds of grease-jets, and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the hosts.At the head of the hall, on a dais, was the table of the king, queen, and their son, Prince Uwaine.Stretching down the hall from this, was the general table, on the floor.At this, above the salt, sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families, of both sexes,—the resident Court, in effect—sixty-one persons; below the salt sat minor officers of the household, with their principal subordinates: altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting, and about as many liveried servants standing behind their chairs, or serving in one capacity or another.It was a very fine show.In a gallery a band with cymbals, horns, harps, and other horrors, opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as “In the Sweet Bye and Bye.”　It was new, and ought to have been rehearsed a little more.For some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged, after dinner."
"音乐过后，站在国王餐桌后的那位牧师站了起来，用似是而非的拉丁语说了一大段堂而皇之的餐前祷告。接着大队的侍从纷纷离开站的地方，穿梭般跑来飞去，端东运西，盛宴就此开始了。谁也没有说话，大家都忙着干正事了。一排排牙床一开一合，整齐划一，那声音听起来就跟地下机器发出的沉闷的嗡嗡声一样。","After this music, the priest who stood behind the royal table said a noble long grace in ostensible Latin.Then the battalion of waiters broke away from their posts, and darted, rushed, flew, fetched and carried, and the mighty feeding began; no words anywhere, but absorbing attention to business.The rows of chops opened and shut in vast unison, and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean machinery."
"这场浩劫持续了一个半钟头，毁灭掉的东西真是超乎想象。宴席的主菜——一只大野猪，刚开始时四腿伸着趴在那儿，多肥实，多壮观——现在什么都没了，光剩个空架子，跟鲸鱼骨裙撑似的。这头猪的命运就代表了其他菜的命运，看看它就知道其他菜什么样了。","The havoc continued an hour and a half, and unimaginable was the destruction of substantials.Of the chief feature of the feast—the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start—nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop-skirt; and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes."
"点心之类一上来，大家就开始狂饮了——还有交谈。一加仑一加仑的葡萄酒和蜂蜜酒都喝光了，大家都喝得舒舒服服，越喝越高兴，越喝越乐得满面红光——无论男女——渐渐开始吵闹起来了。男人们讲着不堪入耳的奇闻轶事，可没人脸红，讲到关键之处的时候，这群乌合之众就发出轰然大笑，把城堡震得直晃。女士们也不甘示弱，讲的野史就连纳瓦拉国的玛格丽特女王，甚至于英国伟大的伊丽莎白女王听了几乎都会用手绢遮住脸，可是这儿却没人遮，只是哈哈大笑——也可以说是鬼哭狼嚎。　　在这些可怕的故事里，几乎所有胆大包天的主角都是神职人员，但那位神甫却满不在乎，还跟着大家一起笑；这还不算，他还应邀吼了一支曲子，要论大胆不比那晚任何一支逊色。","With the pastries and so on, the heavy drinking began—and the talk.Gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared, and everybody got comfortable, then happy, then sparklingly joyous—both sexes,—and by and by pretty noisy.Men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear, but nobody blushed; and when the nub was sprung, the assemblage let go with a horse-laugh that shook the fortress.Ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made Queen Margaret of Navarre or even the great Elizabeth of England hide behind a handkerchief, but nobody hid here, but only laughed—howled, you may say. 　In pretty much all of these dreadful stories, ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes, but that didn’t worry the chaplain any, he had his laugh with the rest; more than that, upon invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was sung that night."
"到了半夜，大家都精疲力尽，笑得肚子都疼了，而且跟往常一样喝得酩酊大醉：有的哭哭啼啼，有的亲亲热热，有的疯疯癫癫，有的吵吵闹闹，还有的不省人事，倒在桌子底下。女士中洋相出最大的当数一位年轻漂亮的伯爵小姐了，她明天就要结婚了，今晚的确是丢人现眼，毫无疑问。就她那副模样，简直可以坐在那里，提前画张像，充当奥尔良摄政王的女儿。那是在法国大革命前那令人怀念、一去不返的好时光里，因为他女儿在一次有名的宴会上醉得一塌糊涂，满嘴胡言乱语，凡事不能自主，只好由人抬到了婚床上。　","By midnight everybody was fagged out, and sore with laughing; and, as a rule, drunk: some weepingly, some affectionately, some hilariously, some quarrelsomely, some dead and under the table.Of the ladies, the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess, whose wedding-eve this was; and indeed she was a spectacle, sure enough.Just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the Regent d’Orleans, at the famous dinner whence she was carried, foul-mouthed, intoxicated, and helpless, to her bed, in the lost and lamented days of the Ancient Regime."
"正当牧师举起双手，那些还有意识的人都低着脑袋，正在等待祈福的时候，突然间大厅那头的拱门处来了一位弯腰驼背，白发苍苍的老妇人，拄着根拐杖。只见她举起拐杖，用它指着王后，大喊：","Suddenly, even while the priest was lifting his hands, and all conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming blessing, there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white-haired lady, leaning upon a crutch-stick; and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the queen and cried out:"
"“愿上帝将怒火和诅咒降到你身上，你这没人性的婆娘，杀了我那无辜的孙儿，我风烛残年，无亲无友，无依无靠，在这个世上只有他了，你却杀了他！”","“The wrath and curse of God fall upon you, woman without pity, who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick, nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him!”"
"大家吓得毛骨悚然，纷纷划着十字，他们这些人最怕诅咒了。可是王后却威风凛凛地站起身来，眼中杀气腾腾，下达了这样一道冷酷无情的指令：","Everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright, for a curse was an awful thing to those people; but the queen rose up majestic, with the death-light in her eye, and flung back this ruthless command:"
"“将她拿下！火刑伺候！”","“Lay hands on her!To the stake with her!”"
"卫兵们奉命起身。这真让人不耻，看起来太残忍了。有什么办法呢？桑迪瞅了我一眼，我知道她又有灵感了。我说道：","The guards left their posts to obey.It was a shame; it was a cruel thing to see.What could be done?Sandy gave me a look; I knew she had another inspiration.I said:"
"“你看着办。”","“Do what you choose.”"
"她马上就站了起来，脸朝着王后。她指着我，说道：","She was up and facing toward the queen in a moment.She indicated me, and said:"
"“夫人，‘头子’说此事不妥。　请收回成命，否则他定将城堡化为齑粉，犹如一场梦一样都变为乌有！”　","“Madame, HE saith this may not be. 　Recall the commandment, or he will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable fabric of a dream!”"
"这个糊涂虫，给我揽了个多荒唐的事情呀！如果王后——","Confound it, what a crazy contract to pledge a person to!What if the queen—"
"可是刚想到这里，我却惊魂消退，恐慌也过去了，因为王后整个吓瘫了，她毫无抵抗，做了个取消命令的手势，就瘫倒在座位上了。她坐下之后才清醒过来。其他人也都清醒了。这一大群人纷纷站起身来，将礼节都抛到了九霄云外，就跟一帮乌合之众似的冲向门口。椅子碰翻了，杯盘摔得粉碎，拉拉扯扯，争先恐后，推推搡搡，挤做一团——只要能逃出去就行，惟恐我改变主意，将城堡一口气吹到那虚无缥缈的太空去。唉，唉，唉，他们可真是帮迷信的家伙。　你得费好大劲才能想得到呢。","But my consternation subsided there, and my panic passed off; for the queen, all in a collapse, made no show of resistance but gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat.When she reached it she was sober.So were many of the others.The assemblage rose, whiffed ceremony to the winds, and rushed for the door like a mob; overturning chairs, smashing crockery, tugging, struggling, shouldering, crowding—anything to get out before I should change my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of space.Well, well, well, they WERE a superstitious lot.　It is all a body can do to conceive of it."
"可怜的王后吓成那样，威风扫地，甚至不先征求一下我的意见，连那个作曲家都不敢绞死。　我真替她难过——真的，谁都会替她难过的，因为她是真遭罪；因此只要合情合理，什么事情我都乐意去做，我可不想做得太绝，搞到荒唐的地步。因此我把事情仔细考虑了一番，最终让他们把那些乐师带到大家面前，再演奏一次“甜美的未来”，他们照做了。　结果我意识到王后是对的，就允许她将整个乐队都绞死。我这里稍微宽容了一点，在王后身上就收到了很好的效果。政治家要是不分场合滥用高压政策，往往收效甚微，因为这样一来会伤了他手下的自尊，结果就可能削弱他的力量。在无伤大雅的情况下，不时做点小小的让步，这才是明智之举。","The poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid to hang the composer without first consulting me. 　I was very sorry for her—indeed, any one would have been, for she was really suffering; so I was willing to do anything that was reasonable, and had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities.I therefore considered the matter thoughtfully, and ended by having the musicians ordered into our presence to play that Sweet Bye and Bye again, which they did. 　　Then I saw that she was right, and gave her permission to hang the whole band.This little relaxation of sternness had a good effect upon the queen.A statesman gains little by the arbitrary exercise of iron-clad authority upon all occasions that offer, for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates, and thus tends to undermine his strength.A little concession, now and then, where it can do no harm, is the wiser policy."
"王后既然心里又踏实了，还有几分高兴，她喝的酒自然而然要再次发作起来，这让她有点管不住自己了。我是说，酒让她那音乐又开始了——她那银铃般的舌头。天呐，她可真太会说啦。要我来提醒她，天色已晚，我又困又累，还不大合适。我真希望自己趁刚才有机会的时候就跑去上床睡觉了。可现在我还得挺着，没别的办法。于是她就叮叮咚咚讲来讲去，整个城堡都睡着了，万籁惧寂，阴森森的。过了一会儿，远远地传来一种声音，好像从我们脚底下的地下深处发出来的，好像是低沉的叫声——带着股痛苦的意味，我听了直起鸡皮疙瘩。王后停了下来，两眼乐得发亮；她歪着那优雅的头，就像只小鸟一样听着。那声音又冲破寂静传了过来。","Now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more, and measurably happy, her wine naturally began to assert itself again, and it got a little the start of her.I mean it set her music going—her silver bell of a tongue.Dear me, she was a master talker.It would not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that I was a tired man and very sleepy.I wished I had gone off to bed when I had the chance.Now I must stick it out; there was no other way.So she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek—with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl.The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; she tilted her graceful head as a bird does when it listens.The sound bored its way up through the stillness again."
"“什么声音？”我问道。","“What is it?” I said."
"“真乃顽固不化之人，竟熬了许久。迄今已过了这许多时辰。”","“It is truly a stubborn soul, and endureth long.It is many hours now.”"
"“熬什么？”","“Endureth what?”"
"“严刑拷打。来吧——煞是好看。若如今他还不肯招认，定叫你眼见他受分尸之苦。”","“The rack.Come—ye shall see a blithe sight.An he yield not his secret now, ye shall see him torn asunder.”"
"好个笑里藏刀的魔鬼，那么气定神闲，而我因为同情那人受的苦，腿上没一根筋不疼的。穿盔甲的卫兵手持熊熊火把在前面带路，我们迈着沉重的脚步向前走，穿过条条带回音的长廊，走下几级石阶，石阶阴冷潮湿，滴着水，还由于常年不见天日发着霉味——这趟走来真是冰冷刺骨，诡异异常，显得十分漫长，即使是那妖女的话也没让这旅途变短或欢快一点，她谈论的都是那个受苦的人和他的罪行。他是被一个匿名的告密者告发的，说他曾在皇家禁苑杀死了一头雄鹿。我说：","What a silky smooth hellion she was; and so composed and serene, when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that man’s pain.Conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches, we tramped along echoing corridors, and down stone stairways dank and dripping, and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night—a chill, uncanny journey and a long one, and not made the shorter or the cheerier by the sorceress’s talk, which was about this sufferer and his crime.He had been accused by an anonymous informer, of having killed a stag in the royal preserves.I said:"
"“匿名者的证词可靠不住，陛下。要被告原告一同对质方显公平。”","“Anonymous testimony isn’t just the right thing, your Highness.It were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser.”"
"“对不对质影响甚微，因此吾未予考虑。不过即便让其对质，也是无法为之，因为原告趁夜幕而来，告知守林官后转身即去，因此守林官也未能认出他来。”","“I had not thought of that, it being but of small consequence.But an I would, I could not, for that the accuser came masked by night, and told the forester, and straightway got him hence again, and so the forester knoweth him not.”"
"“那么只有这个无名氏看见雄鹿被杀吗？”","“Then is this Unknown the only person who saw the stag killed?”"
"“哎呀，杀鹿之事无人瞧见，只是这位无名氏瞧见死鹿旁只有那抵死不招的混蛋，遂出于忠义之心将他告于守林官。”","“Marry, NO man SAW the killing, but this Unknown saw this hardy wretch near to the spot where the stag lay, and came with right loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester.”"
"“既然如此，这位无名氏岂不是也在死鹿身旁？难道不可能是他自己杀了那头鹿吗？他的忠义之心——遮遮掩掩的——看起来有点让人起疑。可是陛下为何拷问这个囚犯呢？这样做有何益处？”","“So the Unknown was near the dead stag, too?Isn’t it just possible that he did the killing himself?His loyal zeal—in a mask—looks just a shade suspicious.But what is your highness’s idea for racking the prisoner?Where is the profit?”"
"“不拷问他怎能招认，不招认则灵魂万劫不复。他犯了罪，当依法处死——吾定教他以命来偿！然若教那厮未曾招认未曾悔罪便死去，岂不危及吾之灵魂。吾若为成全那厮而将自己投身地狱，岂不是愚蠢之至。”","“He will not confess, else; and then were his soul lost.For his crime his life is forfeited by the law—and of a surety will I see that he payeth it!—but it were peril to my own soul to let him die unconfessed and unabsolved.Nay, I were a fool to fling me into hell for HIS accommodation.”"
"“可是，陛下，假如他无可招供呢？”","“But, your Highness, suppose he has nothing to confess?”"
"“这点嘛，稍等片刻即见分晓。若拷打至死他仍未肯招认，许是他真的无罪可招——你道此理可通？　如此以来，一未曾招认之人无罪可招，吾也不必遭到诅咒——为此，吾便无灾无祸了。”","“As to that, we shall see, anon.An I rack him to death and he confess not, it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught to confess—ye will grant that that is sooth?Then shall I not be damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess—wherefore, I shall be safe.”"
"那个时代就是如此顽固不化，不可理喻。跟她争论一点用也没有。在僵化的教育面前，讲理就如同靠波浪来冲击悬崖，获胜的机会微乎其微。何况她所受的教育，和当时其他人受的教育都是一样的。即使把这个国家最聪明的人找出来，也挑不出来她的见解有什么问题。","It was the stubborn unreasoning of the time.It was useless to argue with her.Arguments have no chance against petrified training; they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff.And her training was everybody’s.The brightest intellect in the land would not have been able to see that her position was defective."
"踏进刑讯室，我看到了一幅永远也忘不了的画面，虽然我希望能忘掉。一个个子高高的当地人，三十岁上下，四肢被拉伸开来，脸朝上躺在架子上，手腕脚腕都被绳子捆着，绳子绕在轱辘的两头。　他面无血色，五官都扭曲僵住了，脑门上挂满了汗珠。他两侧各站一位牧师，都弯腰对着他，刽子手站在一旁，卫兵也都各就各位，靠墙的旮旯里点着一支支冒烟的火把，墙角蜷缩着一个可怜的年轻女人，脸痛苦地扭曲着，两眼露出半疯半巅，走投无路的神情，腿上还躺着一个睡着的婴儿。我们刚跨近门槛，刽子手就轻轻转动了一下机器，弄得那个囚犯和那个女人都喊叫了一声。可是我大吼了一声，那个刽子手还没等到看清是谁吼的就忙松了手。我再也无法任由这种恐怖的事情继续下去了；要再看下去非要了我的命不可。我请求王后把这里的人都清出去，我要私下里和那位囚犯谈谈。她刚要反对，我就压低声音对她说我不想在她的侍卫跟前吵闹，可是必须照我说的做，因为我是亚瑟王的代表，我说的话就等于是口传圣旨。她明白自己不屈服不行了。我请她把我给大家介绍一下，然后就留我自己，都出去。她有些不高兴，不过她咽下不悦照办了，甚至还比我要求的多走了一步。我本来只要凭仗她的势力为我撑腰，但她却说：","As we entered the rack-cell I caught a picture that will not go from me; I wish it would.A native young giant of thirty or thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back, with his wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either end. 　There was no color in him; his features were contorted and set, and sweat-drops stood upon his forehead.A priest bent over him on each side; the executioner stood by; guards were on duty; smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls; in a corner crouched a poor young creature, her face drawn with anguish, a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes, and in her lap lay a little child asleep.Just as we stepped across the threshold the executioner gave his machine a slight turn, which wrung a cry from both the prisoner and the woman; but I shouted, and the executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke.I could not let this horror go on; it would have killed me to see it.I asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak to the prisoner privately; and when she was going to object I spoke in a low voice and said I did not want to make a scene before her servants, but I must have my way; for I was King Arthur’s representative, and was speaking in his name.She saw she had to yield.I asked her to indorse me to these people, and then leave me.It was not pleasant for her, but she took the pill; and even went further than I was meaning to require.I only wanted the backing of her own authority; but she said:"
"“尔等诸多事宜须听这位大人指挥。这位是我们的‘头子’”。","“Ye will do in all things as this lord shall command.It is The Boss.”"
"“头子”这个词用来装神弄鬼还真不错：看看这些动起来的大老鼠你就明白了。王后的卫兵们站好队，簇拥着王后，和那些拿火把的人齐刷刷走开了，离去的脚步步调整齐，在深深的巷道里激起阵阵回音。我吩咐将那个囚犯从刑架上解下来，把他安置在床上，用药物处理了一下他的伤口，还给他喝了点酒。那个女人爬了过来，看着他，目光急切而又充满了爱怜，不过还带着点胆怯——就好像怕被拒绝似的；没错，当她试着偷偷摸他的额头，我无意中转过脸来时，她就往后一跳，露出害怕的样子。　看起来真是可怜。","It was certainly a good word to conjure with: you could see it by the squirming of these rats.The queen’s guards fell into line, and she and they marched away, with their torch-bearers, and woke the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating footfalls.I had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his bed, and medicaments applied to his hurts, and wine given him to drink.The woman crept near and looked on, eagerly, lovingly, but timorously,—like one who fears a repulse; indeed, she tried furtively to touch the man’s forehead, and jumped back, the picture of fright, when I turned unconsciously toward her.　It was pitiful to see."
"“老天，”我说道，“摸摸他吧，姑娘，想摸就摸吧。想干什么就干什么吧，不用管我。”","“Lord,” I said, “stroke him, lass, if you want to.Do anything you’re a mind to; don’t mind me.”"
"哎呀，她眼神中的感激之情，就如同你对小动物发了善心，它意识到了后发出的目光一样。马上，她就把孩子放到了一边，将脸颊贴到了那个男人的脸上。她的手抚摩着他的头发，喜极而泣。那个男人醒了过来，因为无法爱抚她的妻子，只好用眼睛深情地望着她。我觉得现在应该把这个洞穴里的人都打发出去了，于是我就把所有的人都清了出去，只留下那家人和我自己。然后我说道：","Why, her eyes were as grateful as an animal’s, when you do it a kindness that it understands.The baby was out of her way and she had her cheek against the man’s in a minute.and her hands fondling his hair, and her happy tears running down.The man revived and caressed his wife with his eyes, which was all he could do.I judged I might clear the den, now, and I did; cleared it of all but the family and myself.Then I said:"
"“朋友，现在你给我讲讲是怎么回事吧，对方的说法我已经都知道了。”","“Now, my friend, tell me your side of this matter; I know the other side.”"
"那个男人摇摇头表示拒绝。可是那个女人看起来很高兴——在我看来是这样——对我的建议感到十分高兴。我继续说道：","The man moved his head in sign of refusal.But the woman looked pleased—as it seemed to me—pleased with my suggestion.I went on—"
"“你知道我是谁吗？”","“You know of me?”"
"“是的。在亚瑟王的国土上，还有谁不认识你。”","“Yes.All do, in Arthur’s realms.”"
"“要是我的名声传到你们的耳朵里还没走样的话，你就不该不敢开口。”","“If my reputation has come to you right and straight, you should not be afraid to speak.”"
"那个女人急忙插了句话：","The woman broke in, eagerly:"
"“啊，我的大人，请您劝劝他吧！您若相劝，定能劝得通。唉，他遭了这么多罪，都是因为我——因为我！教我如何受得起？我宁愿看他死去——甜甜美美的，快点死了；哦，我的雨果，这样我可真受不了！”","“Ah, fair my lord, do thou persuade him!Thou canst an thou wilt.Ah, he suffereth so; and it is for me—for ME!And how can I bear it?I would I might see him die—a sweet, swift death; oh, my Hugo, I cannot bear this one!”"
"她抽抽搭搭哭着，趴在我的脚边一直恳求我。求什么呢？让那个男人死？我有点摸不着头脑了。但是雨果打断了她，说道：","And she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet, and still imploring.Imploring what?The man’s death?I could not quite get the bearings of the thing.But Hugo interrupted her and said:"
"“闭嘴！休要胡言乱语。　难道我要让自己的爱人挨饿受冻，只为自己死得舒服么？我以为你很清楚我的为人。”","“Peace!Ye wit not what ye ask. 　Shall I starve whom I love, to win a gentle death?I wend thou knewest me better.”"
"“哦，”我说，“我有点不大明白。听起来真让人糊涂。那个——”","“Well,” I said, “I can’t quite make this out.It is a puzzle.Now—”"
"“啊，我的大人，请您务必劝劝他！他备受折磨，可不叫我肝肠寸断，望大人体恤则个！唉，他还总是不肯说！可是若他能快乐地速死，还可减轻痛苦，安慰奴家则个——”","“Ah, dear my lord, an ye will but persuade him!Consider how these his tortures wound me!Oh, and he will not speak!—whereas, the healing, the solace that lie in a blessed swift death—”"
"“你胡扯些什么？他会获得自由，太太平平地从这里出去的——他不会死的。”","“What ARE you maundering about?He’s going out from here a free man and whole—he’s not going to die.”"
"那个男人苍白的脸上突然焕发了光彩，而那女人则欣喜若狂，突然间扑到我的面前，喊到：","The man’s white face lit up, and the woman flung herself at me in a most surprising explosion of joy, and cried out:"
"“他有救了！这可是从国王大臣口中传达的圣旨——亚瑟王可是金口玉言！”","“He is saved!—for it is the king’s word by the mouth of the king’s servant—Arthur, the king whose word is gold!”"
"“哦，那么你们终于相信我是可以信赖的了。你们以前为什么不呢？”","“Well, then you do believe I can be trusted, after all.Why didn’t you before?”"
"“谁不相信了？不是我，千真万确，也不是她。”","“Who doubted?Not I, indeed; and not she.”"
"“哦，那为何不跟我讲讲你的事情呢？”","“Well, why wouldn’t you tell me your story, then?”"
"“您还没有发誓；否则我早就讲了。”","“Ye had made no promise; else had it been otherwise.”"
"“我明白啦，明白啦……不过毕竟我还是有点不太明白。　你忍住折磨，拒不招认，就连最笨的人也看得出来你没什么可招供的——”","“I see, I see....And yet I believe I don’t quite see, after all. 　You stood the torture and refused to confess; which shows plain enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing to confess—”"
"“我没什么招供的，大人？怎么会呢？鹿是我杀的！”","“I, my lord?How so?It was I that killed the deer!”"
"“你杀的？哦，天呐，这是我有生以来碰到的最让人糊涂的事情——”","“You DID?Oh, dear, this is the most mixed-up business that ever—”"
"“我的大人，是我双膝跪地求他招供的，不过——”","“Dear lord, I begged him on my knees to confess, but—”"
"“你求他！真是越来越让人糊涂了。你求他招供是为了什么？”","“You DID!It gets thicker and thicker.What did you want him to do that for?”"
"“但求他能够速死，免受酷刑之苦。”","“Sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this cruel pain.”"
"“哦——对，这样也有点道理。但他可不想速死。”","“Well—yes, there is reason in that.But HE didn’t want the quick death.”"
"“他？咳，他巴不得呢。”","“He?Why, of a surety he DID.”"
"“哦，那么他到底为什么还不肯招供呢？”","“Well, then, why in the world DIDN’T he confess?”"
"“啊，可爱的先生呀，难道我能留下自己的老婆孩子挨饿受冻不成？”","“Ah, sweet sir, and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter?”"
"“哦，真是金子般的心啊，现在我明白了！按照严酷的法律，一旦判定一个人有罪，就会收走他的所有家产，让他的妻儿流落街头。他们可以把你折磨死，但是只要没定罪或招供，他们就没法将家产从你的妻儿手里抢走。你一直守护着他们，真是条汉子；而你——也是位真正的妻子，真正的女人——你宁可自己慢慢饿死，也要将他从痛苦中解脱出来——哦，谈到自我牺牲，你们女流之辈真是让人自惭形秽啊。我要约你们到我的领地去，你们会喜欢那里的，那是一个工厂，我要用它来将那些只会埋头干活、不会思考的机器人变成真正的人。”","“Oh, heart of gold, now I see it!The bitter law takes the convicted man’s estate and beggars his widow and his orphans.They could torture you to death, but without conviction or confession they could not rob your wife and baby.You stood by them like a man; and YOU—true wife and the woman that you are—you would have bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow starvation and death—well, it humbles a body to think what your sex can do when it comes to self-sacrifice.I’ll book you both for my colony; you’ll like it there; it’s a Factory where I’m going to turn groping and grubbing automata into MEN.”"
"第十八章　在王后的地牢里","CHAPTER 18 In The Queen’s Dungeons"
"好了，我把一切都安排妥当了，并派人把那个男人送回了家。我真想给那个刽子手也上上刑，倒不是因为他是个好官，自己很能吃苦，也很能让别人吃苦——他尽职尽责地履行自己的职责，这肯定没错——而是因为这个人太不检点，总打那女人耳光，要么就变着法来折磨她。这都是牧师们告诉我的，他们还强烈要求办他的罪。像这类让人不快的事情总时不时冒出来几件。我的意思是，这些事情表明不是所有的牧师都是骗子和自私鬼，他们中的许多人，甚至大多数，都是跟普普通通的老百姓打成一片的，他们待人真诚，为人正直，一心要减轻世人的烦恼和痛苦。唉，这也是免不了的事，所以我也很少为之烦恼，就是烦恼起来也就一小会儿，对于无能为力的事情，我从来就懒得多操心。可是，我确实不喜欢这类事情，因为这样就会让人对国教妥协。我们必须有个宗教——这是无须说的——但是我的想法是，把它砍成四十个独立的部分，这样它们就会互相制约，就像我那个时代的美国那样。把权力都集中在一个政治机器上可不好，而国教也不过是个政治机器，它就是为了这个目的而被发明出来，为了这个目的受到呵护、培养并被保存的。它是人类自由的敌人，它所做的一切善事，如果是在四分五裂的分散状态下，都会做得更好。这不是法律，也不是福音，它只是个意见——我的意见，而我只是个人，千千万万个人中的一个人，所以绝不会比教皇的意见更有价值——或者说也不会更没价值。","WELL, I arranged all that; and I had the man sent to his home.I had a great desire to rack the executioner; not because he was a good, painstaking and paingiving official,—for surely it was not to his discredit that he performed his functions well—but to pay him back for wantonly cuffing and otherwise distressing that young woman.The priests told me about this, and were generously hot to have him punished.Something of this disagreeable sort was turning up every now and then.I mean, episodes that showed that not all priests were frauds and self-seekers, but that many, even the great majority, of these that were down on the ground among the common people, were sincere and right-hearted, and devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings.Well, it was a thing which could not be helped, so I seldom fretted about it, and never many minutes at a time; it has never been my way to bother much about things which you can’t cure.But I did not like it, for it was just the sort of thing to keep people reconciled to an Established Church.We MUST have a religion—it goes without saying—but my idea is, to have it cut up into forty free sects, so that they will police each other, as had been the case in the United States in my time.Concentration of power in a political machine is bad; and an Established Church is only a political machine; it was invented for that; it is nursed, cradled, preserved for that; it is an enemy to human liberty, and does no good which it could not better do in a split-up and scattered condition.That wasn’t law; it wasn’t gospel: it was only an opinion—my opinion, and I was only a man, one man: so it wasn’t worth any more than the pope’s—or any less, for that matter."
"我不能给那个刽子手上刑，但也不能忽略牧师们公正的控告。不管怎么说这个人必须受到惩罚，因此我降了他的职，让他当了那个乐队的队长——一个新的乐队就要组建起来了。他苦苦哀求我，说他不会演奏乐器——这借口听起来似乎有理，但实际站不住脚：这个国家所有的音乐家没一个会演奏的。","Well, I couldn’t rack the executioner, neither would I overlook the just complaint of the priests.The man must be punished somehow or other, so I degraded him from his office and made him leader of the band—the new one that was to be started.He begged hard, and said he couldn’t play—a plausible excuse, but too thin; there wasn’t a musician in the country that could."
"第二天早上，当王后发现自己既要不了雨果的性命也要不了他的家产的时候，不禁勃然大怒。但是我跟她讲，这点委屈她非受不可。当然无论按照法律还是惯例她完全有权把这个男人的性命和财产都拿去，可是有些情况是罪有可恕的，因此我以亚瑟王的名义赦免了他。　那头鹿正在糟蹋那个男人的地时，那男人一时兴起杀了它，并不是为了贪财，他把鹿运到皇家禁苑来，是想让人无法发现杀死鹿的人是谁。这可把她搞糊涂了，我怎么也不能让她明白，因为一时兴起而杀死一头鹿——或者一个人——是情有可原的，于是我就放弃解释，就让她自己郁闷去好了。我居然以为提到她自己因一时兴起杀死侍从那件事，她就会明白什么叫罪有可恕。　","The queen was a good deal outraged, next morning when she found she was going to have neither Hugo’s life nor his property.But I told her she must bear this cross; that while by law and custom she certainly was entitled to both the man’s life and his property, there were extenuating circumstances, and so in Arthur the king’s name I had pardoned him. 　The deer was ravaging the man’s fields, and he had killed it in sudden passion, and not for gain; and he had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make detection of the misdoer impossible.Confound her, I couldn’t make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance in the killing of venison—or of a person—so I gave it up and let her sulk it out. I DID think I was going to make her see it by remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page modified that crime."
"“罪！”她大喊起来。“你说什么呢！罪，老天！嗨，我杀他可是要赔钱的！”","“Crime!” she exclaimed.“How thou talkest!Crime, forsooth!Man, I am going to PAY for him!”"
"唉，跟她讲理简直是白费唇舌。　熏陶——熏陶就是一切，熏陶对于一个人就是一切。我们常常谈及天性，简直是愚蠢，压根就没天性这种东西，我们用这个误导人的词所称为的东西，只不过是遗传和熏陶罢了。我们没有自己的思想，自己的意见，那些思想意见都是别人传给、灌输给我们的。我们身上所有原汁原味的东西，无论是给我们增光还是丢脸的，用一根绣花针的针尖就能盖住，其余的那些统统都是由老祖先贡献出来的原子，由我们继承而来的，可以追溯到十亿年前世界上的头一个蛤蜊，蚂蚱，或者猴子，我们人类经历了漫长的历程从这些东西装模作地、费力不讨好地演化而来。对于我来讲，我在这惨淡的人生旅途上蹒跚而行，在悠悠天地间漂泊不定，就是为了能小心翼翼、谦恭谨慎地过一种纯洁而又高尚，无可指摘的生活，好保留住我身上那个肉眼看不见的小颗粒，那个能代表真我的小颗粒：余下的就是下了地狱我也不管。","Oh, it was no use to waste sense on her. 　Training—training is everything; training is all there is TO a person.We speak of nature; it is folly; there is no such thing as nature; what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training.We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they are transmitted to us, trained into us.All that is original in us, and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest being atoms contributed by, and inherited from, a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed.And as for me, all that I think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage, this pathetic drift between the eternities, is to look out and humbly live a pure and high and blameless life, and save that one microscopic atom in me that is truly ME: the rest may land in Sheol and welcome for all I care."
"嗨，这个糊涂的女人，她的智力还不错，脑子也够用，可是她所受的教育将她变成了笨蛋——就是说，用许多世纪后的观点来看的话。杀死那个侍从算不上什么罪过——那是她的权力；而她就仗着她的权力，若无其事，没有意识到自己犯了罪。她之所以这个样子，就是因为祖祖辈辈的熏陶，他们都不容质疑地相信，容许她随心所欲杀死子民的法律是完全正确，极其正当的。","No, confound her, her intellect was good, she had brains enough, but her training made her an ass—that is, from a many-centuries-later point of view.To kill the page was no crime—it was her right; and upon her right she stood, serenely and unconscious of offense.She was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one."
"唉，就是撒旦，我们也得公平对待啊。　她倒是有一点值得称赞的地方，我也想赞扬一下来着，可是话到嘴边却说不出来。她有权杀死那个孩子，可是她绝对没有赔偿他的义务。对于其他人按法律是要赔偿的，可对她来说就不一样了。　她深知，赔偿那个小伙子就是自己宽宏大量了，因此我应该出于公道说几句堂而皇之的话，可是我办不到——我的嘴拒绝说话。我一闭眼，就不由得看到可怜的老祖母，心都碎了，看到那个俊美的年轻小伙子尸横刀下，小小的虚荣浮华如今被鲜血浸染，宛如丝绸上点缀的金花。她如何赔偿！她能赔偿给谁？因此，尽管深知受了那样熏陶的女人能够这样，值得称赞，甚至奉承，但依我受过的熏陶，我还是说不出口。充其量我只能从别的地方借来句话恭维她——可惜的是，这话说的还都是真的：","Well, we must give even Satan his due. 　She deserved a compliment for one thing; and I tried to pay it, but the words stuck in my throat.She had a right to kill the boy, but she was in no wise obliged to pay for him.That was law for some other people, but not for her. 　She knew quite well that she was doing a large and generous thing to pay for that lad, and that I ought in common fairness to come out with something handsome about it, but I couldn’t—my mouth refused.I couldn’t help seeing, in my fancy, that poor old grandma with the broken heart, and that fair young creature lying butchered, his little silken pomps and vanities laced with his golden blood.How could she PAY for him!WHOM could she pay?And so, well knowing that this woman, trained as she had been, deserved praise, even adulation, I was yet not able to utter it, trained as I had been.The best I could do was to fish up a compliment from outside, so to speak—and the pity of it was, that it was true:"
"“夫人，为此您的子民对您是万分爱戴。”","“Madame, your people will adore you for this.”"
"虽然是真的，可是我真想哪天把她绞死，如果我还能活到那天的话。有些法律真是糟透了，简直糟糕透顶。平白无故，当主人的就能把他的奴隶杀死——仅仅是为了撒气，出于恶意，或者为了打发时间——正如我们曾见到的那样，头戴王冠的人能平白无故杀死自己的奴隶，也就是说，杀死任何人。绅士可以杀死自由的平民，给点赔偿就行——给点现金或者可以换钱的菜蔬。贵族杀死贵族，就法律而言不需要任何代价，不过这样一来会带来冤冤相报。人人都可以杀人，只有平民百姓和奴隶不能，他们没有任何特权。如果他们杀了人，那就是蓄意杀人了，而蓄意杀人是违法的。如果谁以身试法，就会被砍头——而且如果他杀死的人属于带有装饰性头衔的贵族，那他一家老小也要跟着人头落地。若平民百姓跟达米安似的把贵族挠了一下，不要说死了，就连伤都没伤，他也得一点不少的受到达米安那样的惩罚，被几匹马拉得四分五裂，全世界的人还都要来看热闹，逗趣寻开心。那位有趣的卡萨诺瓦曾经在书中记载下了路易十五是如何将他那可怜而蠢笨的敌人五马分尸的，而在场的最上等的人，也曾做过和路易十五一样残暴，一样罄竹难书的事情。","Quite true, but I meant to hang her for it some day if I lived.Some of those laws were too bad, altogether too bad.A master might kill his slave for nothing—for mere spite, malice, or to pass the time—just as we have seen that the crowned head could do it with HIS slave, that is to say, anybody.A gentleman could kill a free commoner, and pay for him—cash or garden-truck.A noble could kill a noble without expense, as far as the law was concerned, but reprisals in kind were to be expected.ANYbody could kill SOME-body, except the commoner and the slave; these had no privileges.If they killed, it was murder, and the law wouldn’t stand murder.It made short work of the experimenter—and of his family, too, if he murdered somebody who belonged up among the ornamental ranks.If a commoner gave a noble even so much as a Damiens-scratch which didn’t kill or even hurt, he got Damiens’ dose for it just the same; they pulled him to rags and tatters with horses, and all the world came to see the show, and crack jokes, and have a good time; and some of the performances of the best people present were as tough, and as properly unprintable, as any that have been printed by the pleasant Casanova in his chapter about the dismemberment of Louis XV.’s poor awkward enemy."
"到了此时，我真是受够了这个可怕的鬼地方了，想要走，可是还走不开，因为我心里有事，良心老是戳着我，让我怎么也放不下。我要是重新造人，一定让他没有一丁点良心。良心在人身上是顶顶讨厌的东西，尽管它也有许许多多好处。可是从长远来看，还是划不来。好处少一点，舒服多一点，这样才好。话说回来，这只是我个人的观点，而我只不过是个人；别人经历得少一点，也许看法就不一样。他们有权保留他们的观点。我只坚持一点：很多年前我就注意到自己的良心了，还很明白它比我从娘胎带来的任何东西都要麻烦，都要让人烦恼。我认为，在一开始我是很珍惜它的，就像我们珍惜任何属于自己的东西一样；可是这是多么愚蠢的想法呀。如果我们换个角度看，我们就会明白这有多荒谬了：要是我肚子里有个铁砧，我难道也要当成宝贝吗？当然不会了。但你如果仔细想想，就会发现良心和砧板没什么差别——我是说在让人不舒服方面。这点我已经观察过上千回了。若你再也受不了那个砧板，你可以用盐酸把它溶解掉，可是你不能这样处理掉你的良心——至少没法斩草除根；反正我是没听说过。","I had had enough of this grisly place by this time, and wanted to leave, but I couldn’t, because I had something on my mind that my conscience kept prodding me about, and wouldn’t let me forget.If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn’t have any conscience.It is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person; and although it certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot be said to pay, in the long run; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort.Still, this is only my opinion, and I am only one man; others, with less experience, may think differently.They have a right to their view.I only stand to this: I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started with.I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we prize anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so.If we look at it in another way, we see how absurd it is: if I had an anvil in me would I prize it?Of course not.And yet when you come to think, there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil—I mean for comfort.I have noticed it a thousand times.And you could dissolve an anvil with acids, when you couldn’t stand it any longer; but there isn’t any way that you can work off a conscience—at least so it will stay worked off; not that I know of, anyway."
"在走之前，我想做点事，但是这事挺招人烦的，我真讨厌着手去做。唉，为这事我烦恼了一整个上午。我本可以跟老国王说说，可那有什么用？——他是座死活山，想当年也曾活跃过，可眼下早已熄火了，只是堆看起来挺唬人的死灰。对我而言，他够温和，够好心，可是毫无疑问，一点用处没有。这个所谓的国王，什么也不是：王后才是这里唯一大权在握的人。她是维苏威火山。作为恩惠，她也许会替你加热一串麻雀，可是接着她或许会趁此机会发发威，把一座城池给埋了。不过，我又转念一想，很多时候你要是做好了最坏的打算，那么结果无论怎样，毕竟也没有那么糟糕。","There was something I wanted to do before leaving, but it was a disagreeable matter, and I hated to go at it.Well, it bothered me all the morning.I could have mentioned it to the old king, but what would be the use?—he was but an extinct volcano; he had been active in his time, but his fire was out, this good while, he was only a stately ash-pile now; gentle enough, and kindly enough for my purpose, without doubt, but not usable.He was nothing, this so-called king: the queen was the only power there.And she was a Vesuvius.As a favor, she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you, but then she might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city.However, I reflected that as often as any other way, when you are expecting the worst, you get something that is not so bad, after all."
"因此，我鼓起勇气，将事情禀告给了王后陛下。我说，我在卡米洛和周围的城堡曾大赦囚犯，如果她恩准，我想看看她那些收藏品，她那些小玩意儿——就是说，她的那些囚犯。她说什么也不准，不过我早料到会那样。不过最后她还是同意了。这点我也料到了，不过没想到这么快。这让我的不快一扫而光。她喊来卫兵，吩咐带上火把，然后我们就一同下到了地牢。这些地牢都建在城堡的地基下，大都是些在天然岩石上凿出来的小房间。有些小房间完全没有一丝光亮。　在其中一间，有个女人，穿着脏兮兮的破衣服，坐在地上一言不发，问什么也不回答，只是偶尔抬起头来，透过蜘蛛网般绞在一起的头发瞅我们两眼，好像看看到底发生了什么意外，哪里来的声音和光线，打乱了那已成为她生活的毫无意义而又平淡乏味的梦。瞅完了，她又低头坐着，两只满是污垢的手交叉起来，懒洋洋地放在大腿上，再也没有别的表示了。表面上看来这堆可怜的骨头架子是个中年妇女，不过也只是表面上看来。她已经在这里呆了九年了，进来的时候只有十八岁。她是个平民，在新婚之夜被勃勒斯·桑辟泰爵士，附近的一位领主，送到这里来的。她父亲是爵士的属下，她不但拒绝领主行使被称为“初夜权”的那种权力，还以暴制暴，居然使领主流了半吉耳几乎能称为神圣的血液。","So I braced up and placed my matter before her royal Highness.I said I had been having a general jail-delivery at Camelot and among neighboring castles, and with her permission I would like to examine her collection, her bric-a-brac—that is to say, her prisoners.She resisted; but I was expecting that.But she finally consented.I was expecting that, too, but not so soon.That about ended my discomfort.She called her guards and torches, and we went down into the dungeons.These were down under the castle’s foundations, and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living rock.Some of these cells had no light at all. 　In one of them was a woman, in foul rags, who sat on the ground, and would not answer a question or speak a word, but only looked up at us once or twice, through a cobweb of tangled hair, as if to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life; after that, she sat bowed, with her dirt-caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap, and gave no further sign.This poor rack of bones was a woman of middle age, apparently; but only apparently; she had been there nine years, and was eighteen when she entered.She was a commoner, and had been sent here on her bridal night by Sir Breuse Sance Pite, a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was, and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du seigneur, and, moreover, had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood."
"这时那位年轻的丈夫也出来干涉，他惟恐新娘性命难保，就把那个贵族揪到客厅，扔在那些出身卑微、瑟瑟发抖的宾客堆里，那位领主躺在那里，因为受到如此奇怪的待遇而目瞪口呆，和那对新婚夫妇结下了不解之仇。　那位领主家里地牢太挤，因此就请求王后代为收容那两位罪犯，自此他们就再也没离开过这个监狱；确实，就在此地，就在他们犯罪后不到一个钟头，他们就进来了，而且从那以后彼此再也没见过面。他们就在这里，就像深深藏在同一块岩石里的两只蟾蜍。他们就这样度过了九年暗无天日的日子，彼此相离不过五十英尺，却不知对方是死是活。在头几年里，他们老是问一个问题——苦苦哀求，流着眼泪，就是石头早晚也许都能为之感动，可是人心不是石头：“他还活着吗？”　“她还活着吗？”　但是他们得不到任何回答。最终他们不再打听这件事了——什么事也不打听了。","The young husband had interfered at that point, believing the bride’s life in danger, and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests, in the parlor, and left him there astonished at this strange treatment, and implacably embittered against both bride and groom.The said lord being cramped for dungeon-room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals, and here in her bastile they had been ever since; hither, indeed, they had come before their crime was an hour old, and had never seen each other since.Here they were, kenneled like toads in the same rock; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet of each other, yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not.All the first years, their only question had been—asked with beseechings and tears that might have moved stones, in time, perhaps, but hearts are not stones: “Is he alive?” “Is she alive?” But they had never got an answer; and at last that question was not asked any more—or any other."
"听了这一切，我很想见见那个男人。他才三十四岁，可看起来有六十了。他坐在一块方方的石头上，垂着头，前臂放在膝盖上，长长的头发像刘海一样垂在脸上，嘴里嘟嘟囔囔自言自语着。他仰起下巴，慢吞吞地打量了我们一番，没精打采，目光呆滞，因为受不了火把的照射而眨着眼睛，然后他又垂下头来，继续嘟嘟囔囔，再也不理会我们了。有些东西，虽然不能说话，却能充当见证，引人遐想，叫人同情。在他的手腕和脚腕上，到处都是疤痕，长平了的旧疤痕。他坐的那块石头上栓着条铁链，连着一副手铐和脚镣。可是这套刑具扔在地上没用，生了厚厚的锈。囚犯的精神一垮，铁链也就用不着了。","I wanted to see the man, after hearing all this.He was thirty-four years old, and looked sixty.He sat upon a squared block of stone, with his head bent down, his forearms resting on his knees, his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face, and he was muttering to himself.He raised his chin and looked us slowly over, in a listless dull way, blinking with the distress of the torchlight, then dropped his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us.There were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present.On his wrists and ankles were cicatrices, old smooth scars, and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached; but this apparatus lay idle on the ground, and was thick with rust.Chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner."
"我怎么也唤不醒那个人，于是我就说把他带到那女人面前，看看能不能清醒——想当年那位新娘在他眼里曾是全世界最美丽的——对他来讲那是用玫瑰、珍珠和露珠做成的躯体，是奇迹，是大自然的杰作：眼睛比谁的都好看，声音比谁的都动听，那么纯净，那么柔嫩，那么优雅，只有梦中仙女才拥有如此的美丽——他是这么想的——别人谁也不配。见到她，他那凝滞的血液就会跳动起来，见到她——","I could not rouse the man; so I said we would take him to her, and see—to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him, once—roses, pearls, and dew made flesh, for him; a wonder-work, the master-work of nature: with eyes like no other eyes, and voice like no other voice, and a freshness, and lithe young grace, and beauty, that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams—as he thought—and to no other.The sight of her would set his stagnant blood leaping; the sight of her—"
"可是结果让人大失所望。他们一起坐在地上，用略带奇怪的眼神互相瞅了一会儿彼此的脸，带着点动物的好奇，接着他们就忘了彼此的存在，眼皮耷拉下来，你能看出他们又走神了，进入虚无缥缈的梦境，不知游荡到哪个不为我们所知的遥远国度去了。","But it was a disappointment.They sat together on the ground and looked dimly wondering into each other’s faces a while, with a sort of weak animal curiosity; then forgot each other’s presence, and dropped their eyes, and you saw that they were away again and wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about."
"我命人将他们带了出来，送到他们的朋友那里。王后对此不大赞成。倒不是她觉得此事对她个人有什么不好，而是因为她觉得这样对勃勒斯·桑辟泰爵士大不敬。不过，我向她保证，如果爵士觉得受不了的话，我就修理修理他，让他受得了。","I had them taken out and sent to their friends.The queen did not like it much.Not that she felt any personal interest in the matter, but she thought it disrespectful to Sir Breuse Sance Pite.However, I assured her that if he found he couldn’t stand it I would fix him so that he could."
"我从这可怕的老鼠洞里放出了四十七名囚犯，只剩一个关在里面。他是个领主，把另外一个领主给杀了，那人跟王后沾亲带故。那位领主曾经埋伏起来要暗杀他，可是却让这位占了上风，割断了喉咙。不过，我并不是为了这个原因才把他留在监狱里的，而是因为他恶意毁坏了他的一个穷村庄里的唯一一口水井。王后因为此人杀死了皇亲国戚，定要绞死他，可是我却不准：杀死暗杀自己的人，算什么犯罪。可是我说我愿意让她因为毁坏水井罪来绞死他，因此她决定这样也能凑合，总比不治罪强。","I set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat-holes, and left only one in captivity.He was a lord, and had killed another lord, a sort of kinsman of the queen.That other lord had ambushed him to assassinate him, but this fellow had got the best of him and cut his throat.However, it was not for that that I left him jailed, but for maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched villages.The queen was bound to hang him for killing her kinsman, but I would not allow it: it was no crime to kill an assassin.But I said I was willing to let her hang him for destroying the well; so she concluded to put up with that, as it was better than nothing."
"老天，那四十七个男男女女被关在那里，大多都是为了多么微不足道的小罪啊！真的，有些人根本不是因为犯了罪才被关进来的，之所以被关进来只不过是为了给某人泄泄愤，而且泄的不都是王后的愤，有些是王后的朋友的。最后进来的那个囚犯所犯的罪，只不过是说了一句话。他说自己认为所有人都差不多，要是剥了衣服，这个人和那个人没什么区别。他说他认为若把全国的人都剥得赤条条的，找个生人在人群中辨认，那人肯定分不出来谁是国王，谁是江湖郎中，也分不出来谁是公爵，谁是旅馆服务员。显而易见，这里还有这么个人，脑子还没因为白痴的熏陶而变成一堆没用的豆腐渣。我把他放了出来，送他去我的工厂。","Dear me, for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven men and women were shut up there!Indeed, some were there for no distinct offense at all, but only to gratify somebody’s spite; and not always the queen’s by any means, but a friend’s.The newest prisoner’s crime was a mere remark which he had made.He said he believed that men were about all alike, and one man as good as another, barring clothes.He said he believed that if you were to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd, he couldn’t tell the king from a quack doctor, nor a duke from a hotel clerk.Apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training.I set him loose and sent him to the Factory."
"有些凿在天然岩石上的小屋正好在那悬崖峭壁的后面，每间小屋都向外凿通一个箭头状的小口，好透进光线来，关在里面的人也能见到一小缕阳光，算是慰藉。这些可怜的家伙当中有个人特别悲惨。他那黑咕隆咚如燕子窝般大小的牢房凿在一块巨大的天然岩石壁上，通过那个箭头状的小孔他能看到远处山谷里他自己的家；二十二年来他就天天通过那小孔望着它，满是心痛，满是思念。夜里，他能看见灯火闪烁，白天，他能看到有人进进出出——那准是他的老婆和孩子，准是他们几个，尽管距离太远他看不真切。年复一年，他见到家里办了好几桩喜事，自己也想欢喜来着，还猜想他们到底是在办婚礼还是别的什么。他也看到了葬礼，让他心如刀绞。他能认出棺材，但他判断不了有多大，因此无从知晓是他妻子的还是孩子的。他能看到送葬的队伍，有牧师，有送葬的人，庄重肃穆地走远了，把秘密也一起带走了。他身后留下了五个孩子和一个妻子；十九年来他共看到过五次葬礼，哪次都很隆重，不像是为仆人而办。因此他已经失去了五个珍爱的人了，那必定还剩下一个——这一个如今可是要多珍贵就有多珍贵——但是是哪个呢？妻子，还是孩子？这个问题一直折磨着他，无论白天还是黑夜，无论是睡着还是醒着。唉，在地牢里，要是还有点什么兴趣，有半缕光线，就能极好地支撑人的身体和保存人的神智。这个人状态还相当不错。　听他给我讲完他的悲惨故事，我心里的滋味呀，要是你也有普通人的好奇心，你心里的滋味准得和我的一样，也就是说，我跟他一样心急火燎，很想知道剩下的那个家里人是谁。因此我就亲自把他送回了家，这个惊喜派对可真是奇妙无比——大家的狂喜犹如阵阵飓风，欢乐的泪水犹如尼亚加拉大瀑布！哎呀天呐！我们发现以前那个年轻的主妇已经头发花白，差不多临近五十，孩子们也都长大成人了，还有的已经结婚了，并且也为人父母了——整个家族一个人也没死！想想那位王后简直坏透了：她特别憎恨这个囚犯，所以就自己搞出那些葬礼，来烤灼他的心；整个事情中最绝的那招就是让那家所有人都奔赴阴曹，单单留一个人让他耗尽那点可怜的精神猜来猜去。　　要不是我，他永远也甭想出来。小仙女嫫干恨他恨到骨子里了，一辈子也不会对他心慈手软。然而他犯的罪，与其说是有意为非作歹，不如说是无心之过。他对人说她长着红头发。唉，她确实是红头发，不过可千万不能这么说。　如果一个人社会地位高了，那么红头发就是红褐色的。","Some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the face of the precipice, and in each of these an arrow-slit had been pierced outward to the daylight, and so the captive had a thin ray from the blessed sun for his comfort.The case of one of these poor fellows was particularly hard.From his dusky swallow’s hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out through the arrow-slit and see his own home off yonder in the valley; and for twenty-two years he had watched it, with heartache and longing, through that crack.He could see the lights shine there at night, and in the daytime he could see figures go in and come out—his wife and children, some of them, no doubt, though he could not make out at that distance.In the course of years he noted festivities there, and tried to rejoice, and wondered if they were weddings or what they might be.And he noted funerals; and they wrung his heart.He could make out the coffin, but he could not determine its size, and so could not tell whether it was wife or child.He could see the procession form, with priests and mourners, and move solemnly away, bearing the secret with them.He had left behind him five children and a wife; and in nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue, and none of them humble enough in pomp to denote a servant.So he had lost five of his treasures; there must still be one remaining—one now infinitely, unspeakably precious,—but WHICH one? wife, or child?That was the question that tortured him, by night and by day, asleep and awake.Well, to have an interest, of some sort, and half a ray of light, when you are in a dungeon, is a great support to the body and preserver of the intellect.This man was in pretty good condition yet. 　By the time he had finished telling me his distressful tale, I was in the same state of mind that you would have been in yourself, if you have got average human curiosity; that is to say, I was as burning up as he was to find out which member of the family it was that was left.So I took him over home myself; and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was, too—typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy, and whole Niagaras of happy tears; and by George!we found the aforetime young matron graying toward the imminent verge of her half century, and the babies all men and women, and some of them married and experimenting familywise themselves—for not a soul of the tribe was dead!Conceive of the ingenious devilishness of that queen: she had a special hatred for this prisoner, and she had INVENTED all those funerals herself, to scorch his heart with; and the sublimest stroke of genius of the whole thing was leaving the family-invoice a funeral SHORT, so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing.But for me, he never would have got out.Morgan le Fay hated him with her whole heart, and she never would have softened toward him.And yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than deliberate depravity.He had said she had red hair.Well, she had; but that was no way to speak of it. 　When redheaded people are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn."
"想想吧，这四十七个囚犯中有五位姓甚名谁，犯了什么罪，哪天关进来的，都已经没有人知道了。一个女人，四个男人——都是弯腰驼背，满脸皱纹，已经成了心如死灰的老朽之人了。他们自己早已忘记了这些细节；至少他们只记得个大概，每次说起来都一次一个样子，次次都不同。不断有牧师来到这里，主要职责就是天天跟那些囚犯一起祷告，提醒他们，上帝派他们来到这里有其圣明的目的，还告诉他们，上帝喜欢看到下等人能够忍辱负重，卑躬屈膝，逆来顺受；关于这些可怜的老废物，这些牧师倒是也知道点传说，可也只是传说而已。这些传说也没什么用处，因为都仅仅是关于关押时间长短的，没提到罪名。即使是有了这些传说，唯一能够证明的就是有三十五年这五个人谁也没见过天日：至于这之前还有多久没见天日已经无从猜测了。国王和王后对于这些可怜虫是一无所知，光知道这些人是祖传下来的，是从先前的产业随着王位一起继承来的资产。他们的历史一点也没有随着人一起传下来，因此这些继承财产的人认为他们毫无价值，对他们也毫无兴趣。我对王后说到：","Consider it: among these forty-seven captives there were five whose names, offenses, and dates of incarceration were no longer known!One woman and four men—all bent, and wrinkled, and mind-extinguished patriarchs.They themselves had long ago forgotten these details; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them, nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same way.The succession of priests whose office it had been to pray daily with the captives and remind them that God had put them there, for some wise purpose or other, and teach them that patience, humbleness, and submission to oppression was what He loved to see in parties of a subordinate rank, had traditions about these poor old human ruins, but nothing more.These traditions went but little way, for they concerned the length of the incarceration only, and not the names of the offenses.And even by the help of tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years: how much longer this privation has lasted was not guessable.The king and the queen knew nothing about these poor creatures, except that they were heirlooms, assets inherited, along with the throne, from the former firm.Nothing of their history had been transmitted with their persons, and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no value, and had felt no interest in them.I said to the queen:"
"“那么你为什么不放了他们呢？”","“Then why in the world didn’t you set them free?”"
"这个问题把她问住了。她不明白自己为什么没放，她心里从来没想过这个问题。于是她这么一来，就准确预言了未来迪夫堡囚犯的历史，她自己却浑然不觉。这下我似乎明白了，根据她受的熏陶，这些继承来的囚犯只不过是种财产——不多也不少。唉，当我们继承了财产，就不会想要扔掉了，即使觉得没什么价值。","The question was a puzzler.She didn’t know WHY she hadn’t, the thing had never come up in her mind.So here she was, forecasting the veritable history of future prisoners of the Castle d’If, without knowing it.It seemed plain to me now, that with her training, those inherited prisoners were merely property—nothing more, nothing less.Well, when we inherit property, it does not occur to us to throw it away, even when we do not value it."
"我把那队变得跟蝙蝠似的人带到了光天化日之下，午后的阳光很是晃眼——因为他们的眼睛已经许久不见亮光，所以怕他们受不了提前给他们的眼睛蒙上了——这帮人可真有的瞧。　一个个像骷髅，像稻草人，像妖怪，像可怜的丑八怪；他们都是得到上帝和国教的恩准，由君主立宪产生的最合法的子女。我随口咕哝一句：","When I brought my procession of human bats up into the open world and the glare of the afternoon sun—previously blindfolding them, in charity for eyes so long untortured by light—they were a spectacle to look at. 　Skeletons, scarecrows, goblins, pathetic frights, every one; legitimatest possible children of Monarchy by the Grace of God and the Established Church.I muttered absently:"
"“真希望能用相机把他们拍下来！”","“I WISH I could photograph them!”"
"你肯定见过这种人，遇到唬人的新词，明明不懂什么意思，却死活不肯承认。　真是可怜，他们越是无知，就越要装出一副你不是在对牛弹琴的样子。王后就是这种人，她总是闹出最最愚蠢的笑话来。她迟疑了一下，接着脸上就浮现出恍然大悟的神情，说她替我去办。","You have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they don’t know the meaning of a new big word.The more ignorant they are, the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you haven’t shot over their heads.The queen was just one of that sort, and was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it.She hesitated a moment; then her face brightened up with sudden comprehension, and she said she would do it for me."
"我心想：就她？哼，她懂什么照相？不过当时却不容你多想。我四下里一看，发现她手拿斧子直奔那队人而去！","I thought to myself: She?why what can she know about photography?But it was a poor time to be thinking.When I looked around, she was moving on the procession with an axe!"
"唉，她的确是个稀罕物，这个小仙女嫫干。当年各式各样的女人我也见过不少，可论变化多端，没一个能与她匹敌。这个小插曲多么深刻地显露了她的本性。对于给那队人拍照，她懂的不比一匹马多，可是虽然没有把握，却还是拿起斧子就来，这才是她的本色呢。","Well, she certainly was a curious one, was Morgan le Fay.I have seen a good many kinds of women in my time, but she laid over them all for variety.And how sharply characteristic of her this episode was.She had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph a procession; but being in doubt, it was just like her to try to do it with an axe."

"第二天一大早，我和桑迪就又上路了。那古老的秃鹫巢穴里散发着精神和物质两方面的恶臭，让人无法忍受，我们在那里呆了两天两夜，身体和精神都被熏得喘不过气来，现在又能打开肺腑，大口大口呼吸上帝恩赐的空气，那空气纯净无比，带着露珠的清新和树林的芬芳。我是说，这是对我而言：桑迪这辈子过惯了上等人的生活，对她来说那地方当然很不错，够舒服。","SANDY and I were on the road again, next morning, bright and early.It was so good to open up one’s lungs and take in whole luscious barrels-ful of the blessed God’s untainted, dew-fashioned, woodlandscented air once more, after suffocating body and mind for two days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable old buzzard-roost!mean, for me: of course the place was all right and agreeable enough for Sandy, for she had been used to high life all her days."
"可怜的姑娘，她的嘴巴早已歇了一会儿，歇得让她不耐烦了，我已准备好了承受后果。我是对的，不过她在城堡时曾站在我这边，帮了我很大的忙，用百分之百的愚蠢有力地支持了我，增援了我，在那种情形下她那百分之百的愚蠢比百分之二百的聪明还有用，因此我觉得，只要她乐意，她有权打开一会儿她的话匣子，所以当她真打开时我感觉也没那么痛苦了。","Poor girl, her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while, and I was expecting to get the consequences.I was right; but she had stood by me most helpfully in the castle, and had mightily supported and reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were worth more for the occasion than wisdoms double their size; so I thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while, if she wanted to, and I felt not a pang when she started it up:"

"“如今话说马霍斯爵士，带着那位年方三十的少女，骑马南下。他们来到一片茂密的森林，不料天色已晚，骑马艰难前行，终于来到南陲公爵所在的庄园，遂上前投宿。次日早上，公爵派人来请马霍斯爵士，吩咐他快快准备停当。于是马霍斯爵士起身披挂停当，听人在面前唱完弥撒，用过早膳，遂来到城堡院中，翻身上马，就在此地准备开战。公爵早已骑在马上等候多时，全身披挂，六个儿子侍立一旁，个个手执长矛，于是双方交手，公爵和他两个儿子的长矛都纷纷折断，而马霍斯爵士却收起长矛，没动他们一根毫毛。随后那四个儿子也两两放马上前，又两两折断长矛。自始至终马霍斯爵士都未曾出手。随后，马霍斯爵士直取公爵，连人带马将其戳翻在地。他又如法炮制，撅翻其余六子。随后马霍斯爵士下得马来，吩咐公爵快快投降，否则定取其性命。这时有几子挣扎着起来，欲取马霍斯爵士。马霍斯爵士随即对公爵发话道：‘快快喝住你的儿子，否则定叫你父子遭殃。’公爵明白难逃一死，遂喝住儿子，命他们向马霍斯爵士投降。于是诸子纷纷下跪，将剑柄倒转呈上，马霍斯爵士一一收下。随后他们扶起老父，同声向马霍斯爵士保证永不与亚瑟王为敌，到降灵节之日，父子定会自行投首，乞求国王恩典。*","“Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty winter of age southward.And so they came into a deep forest, and by fortune they were nighted, and rode along in a deep way, and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke of South Marches, and there they asked harbour.And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus, and bad him make him ready.And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and there was a mass sung afore him, and he brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle, there they should do the battle.So there was the duke already on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons by him, and every each had a spear in his hand, and so they encountered, whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them.Then came the four sons by couples, and two of them brake their spears, and so did the other two.And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them not.Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth.And so he served his sons.And then Sir Marhaus alight down, and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him.And then some of his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir Marhaus.Then Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or else I will do the uttermost to you all.When the duke saw he might not escape the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them to Sir Marhaus.And they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the knight, and so he received them.And then they holp up their father, and so by their common assent promised unto Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after, to come he and his sons, and put them in the king’s grace.*"

"此事经过正是如此，尊敬的大人。现今大人您可晓得，那公爵及其六子正是几日前大人您制服并送与亚瑟王宫廷之人！”","Even so standeth the history, fair Sir Boss.Now ye shall wit that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you also did overcome and send to Arthur’s court!”"
"“啊，桑迪，你说的不是真的吧！”","“Why, Sandy, you can’t mean it!”"
"“若有半点虚言，天诛地灭。”","“An I speak not sooth, let it be the worse for me.”"
"“好家伙，好家伙——这事谁能想得到呢？一个大公爵加上六个小公爵，好家伙，桑迪，这回收获可不小呢。游侠骑士这种行当是顶顶愚蠢的傻瓜才干的，还劳神费力，不过我开始看出点门道来了，这里面有利可图，如果你点子正的话。这并不是说我要把它当正事来干，我才不会呢。光靠投机可干不成正当合法的营生。干游侠骑士这一行当确实能猛的一下火了——可是撇开那些没用的东西，看看冰冷的现实，还剩下什么呢？不过是囤积了些猪肉罢了，没别的，除此之外你什么也得不到。你是有钱了——对——突然暴富——一天之间，也许一周之间。然后别人也对你垄断市场，你那个投机倒把的小店一下子就倒了，是不是这样，桑迪？”","“Well, well, well,—now who would ever have thought it?One whole duke and six dukelets; why, Sandy, it was an elegant haul.Knight-errantry is a most chuckle-headed trade, and it is tedious hard work, too, but I begin to see that there IS money in it, after all, if you have luck.Not that I would ever engage in it as a business, for I wouldn’t.No sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of speculation.A successful whirl in the knight-errantry line—now what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts?It’s just a corner in pork, that’s all, and you can’t make anything else out of it.You’re rich—yes,—suddenly rich—for about a day, maybe a week; then somebody corners the market on YOU, and down goes your bucketshop; ain’t that so, Sandy?”"
"“敢是小女子脑子出了问题，简单言语听上去缘何颠三倒四不知所云——”","“Whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth, bewraying simple language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong and overthwart—”"
"“转弯抹角，顾左右而言他，这都没用，桑迪，事情就是这样，就像我说的这样。　我知道的事实就是如此。而且，要是追根到底，游侠骑士还不如囤积猪肉呢，无论发生什么事，猪肉还能留下来，总有人会得到好处；可是游侠生意中，市场一旦崩溃，手里的骑士一个个都玩完了，你还有什么资产？就剩下一堆垃圾似的碎皮烂肉和一两桶废铜烂铁罢了。你能管那些叫资产？无论什么时候我都要猪肉。我说的对吧？”","“There’s no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around it that way, Sandy, it’s SO, just as I say. 　I KNOW it’s so.And, moreover, when you come right down to the bedrock, knight-errantry is WORSE than pork; for whatever happens, the pork’s left, and so somebody’s benefited anyway; but when the market breaks, in a knight-errantry whirl, and every knight in the pool passes in his checks, what have you got for assets?Just a rubbish-pile of battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware.Can you call THOSE assets?Give me pork, every time.Am I right?”"
"“啊，许是小女子头脑不清了，近日琐事繁多，真真叫人头昏眼花，非小女子一个，也非大人您一个，咱们二人，都——”","“Ah, peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and fortunings whereby not I alone nor you alone, but every each of us, meseemeth—”"
"“不对，不是你头脑的问题，桑迪。就头脑来说，你的头脑没问题，但是你对这行当一窍不通，这才是麻烦所在。你不适合去争论什么买卖不买卖，可你总要去争，这就不对了。可是，这点姑且不论，反正收获还是很大的，在亚瑟王的朝廷里准得让我们声名大震。至于那些牛仔，这个国家真古怪，那些男男女女怎么从来都不会老呢。看看小仙女嫫干，那么娇嫩，那么年轻，怎么瞧都跟瓦萨尔的小母鸡似的；再瞧瞧那位南陲老公爵，一大把年纪了，儿孙满堂，仍能舞刀弄枪。就我所知，盖文爵士已经杀死了他的七个儿子，可是他还有六个儿子留下来等马霍斯爵士和我捉拿归营。此外还有那度过了六十寒暑的少女，还能在她那满是白霜的花季四处游荡——你多大了，桑迪？”","“No, it’s not your head, Sandy.Your head’s all right, as far as it goes, but you don’t know business; that’s where the trouble is.It unfits you to argue about business, and you’re wrong to be always trying.However, that aside, it was a good haul, anyway, and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in Arthur’s court.And speaking of the cowboys, what a curious country this is for women and men that never get old.Now there’s Morgan le Fay, as fresh and young as a Vassar pullet, to all appearances, and here is this old duke of the South Marches still slashing away with sword and lance at his time of life, after raising such a family as he has raised.As I understand it, Sir Gawaine killed seven of his sons, and still he had six left for Sir Marhaus and me to take into camp.And then there was that damsel of sixty winter of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom—How old are you, Sandy?”"
"这还是头一次我见她哑巴了。磨房可能是关闭了要维修吧，或者别的什么。","It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her.The mill had shut down for repairs, or something."
"第二十章　妖怪的城堡","CHAPTER 20 The Ogre’s Castle"
"从六点走到九点，我们走了十英里，这对于一匹以一当三的马——驮着一个男人，一个女人和一副铠甲——已经够不错了。后来，我们来到了一条清澈的小溪旁，在几棵树下停住，好好地休息了一大中午。","BETWEEN six and nine we made ten miles, which was plenty for a horse carrying triple—man, woman, and armor; then we stopped for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook."
"此时，一位骑士骑着马走了过来，走近时嘴里还哀愁地哼哼着，从字句中我听出来他是在诅咒骂人。尽管如此，见他来我还是很高兴，因为我见他带着一块广告牌，上面用闪闪的金字写着：","Right so came by and by a knight riding; and as he drew near he made dolorous moan, and by the words of it I perceived that he was cursing and swearing; yet nevertheless was I glad of his coming, for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ:"
"“请用彼得森氏防病牙刷——风靡全国。”","“USE PETERSON S PROPHYLACTIC TOOTH-BRUSH—ALL THE GO.”"
"见他来了我很高兴，因为单凭他那块招牌我就知道他是我手下的骑士。来者乃山中马铎克爵士，这家伙高大魁梧，最主要的功绩便是有一次险些把兰斯洛特爵士打下马来。只要有生人在场，挺不了多长时间他就会自己没话找话把这个伟大事迹讲出来。但还有一件事，和这个差不多，人家若是不问，他从来也不说，可要是问起来，他也绝不隐瞒：那就是，他之所以未能得手，乃是因为半路上他自己被人家打落下马。这个天真的傻大个儿看不出这两个事实之间有任何差别。我喜欢他，因为他干活认真，是个可用之材。而且他看上去也仪表堂堂，穿着盔甲的肩膀非常宽阔，头盔上插着羽毛，象狮子般威风凛凛，巨大的盾牌上绘着怪有趣的图案，那是一只手，戴着铁护手，抓着一支防病牙刷，上面写有标语一行：“请用‘牙不痛’。”　　这是我引进推广的一种刷牙水。","I was glad of his coming, for even by this token I knew him for knight of mine.It was Sir Madok de la Montaine, a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse-tail once.He was never long in a stranger’s presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact.But there was another fact of nearly the same size, which he never pushed upon anybody unasked, and yet never withheld when asked: that was, that the reason he didn’t quite succeed was, that he was interrupted and sent down over horse-tail himself.This innocent vast lubber did not see any particular difference between the two facts.I liked him, for he was earnest in his work, and very valuable.And he was so fine to look at, with his broad mailed shoulders, and the grand leonine set of his plumed head, and his big shield with its quaint device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush, with motto: “Try Noyoudont.” 　This was a tooth-wash that I was introducing."
"他说自己已经精疲力尽了，看起来也的确如此，不过他却不肯下马。他说自己正找那个推销刷炉粉的呢，说着说着他又咒骂起来。那位推销员指得是塞卢斯的欧赛斯爵士，是位勇敢的骑士，颇有些名气，因为他曾经跟盖赫黎斯那样的大人物比试过武艺——只不过没有得胜罢了。他生性乐天，整日嘻嘻哈哈，对他来讲这世上没什么大不了的事。就为这，我才选中了他来培养人们对于刷炉粉的好感。当时还没有炉子呢，因此刷炉粉一事也纯属闹着玩。经销人员所要做的只是巧妙地、一步一步地让人们为那伟大的变革作好准备，在炉子登上历史舞台之前先养成爱清洁的好习惯。","He was aweary, he said, and indeed he looked it; but he would not alight.He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew.The bulletin-boarder referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once, with no less a Mogul that Sir Gaheris himself—although not successfully.He was of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious.It was for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish sentiment.There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing serious about stove-polish.All that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change, and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage."
"马铎克爵士一肚子怒火，又咒骂起来。他说自己骂得已经口干舌燥了，可在找到欧赛斯爵士，跟他算清这笔帐之前，他是不会下马的，也不会休息，别人怎么劝慰也绝不会听从的。我把他说得那些支离破碎的污言秽语拼到一起，听出他似乎是说，那天早上他偶然碰到了欧赛斯爵士，欧赛斯爵士告诉他说如果他抄近道，穿过那些田野和沼泽，越过那些山峦和林中空地，就能堵截到一队旅客，对于防病药水和刷牙水来讲，他们可是千载难逢的好主顾呢。以他那特有的热情，马铎克爵士马上就投身到了这场探寻之中，在跋山涉水奔波了三个小时后终于赶上了他的猎物。可一瞧，竟然是头天晚上刚从地牢里放出来的那五位老者！这些可怜的老家伙，整整二十年了，谁嘴里还有零星半点的牙齿，还有半点有牙的感觉？","Sir Madok was very bitter, and brake out anew with cursings.He said he had cursed his soul to rags; and yet he would not get down from his horse, neither would he take any rest, or listen to any comfort, until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this account.It appeared, by what I could piece together of the unprofane fragments of his statement, that he had chanced upon Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning, and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and glades, he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics and tooth-wash.With characteristic zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest, and after three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game.And behold, it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before!Poor old creatures, it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth."
"“直娘贼，”马铎克爵士说，“我若寻着他，定要用刷炉粉刷他，瞧我的吧。今日我立此重誓，管他是叫欧赛斯还是别的什么名字，胆敢消遣我，定教他拿命来。”","“Blank-blank-blank him,” said Sir Madok, “an I do not stove-polish him an I may find him, leave it to me; for never no knight that hight Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide on live, an I may find him, the which I have thereunto sworn a great oath this day.”"
"说完这些，还说了点别的，他就立即提枪而去。下午过半的时候，在接近一个穷村子时，我们自己也碰到了一位上文刚提过的老者。他正沐浴在亲友的关爱之中，他们已经五十年未曾见面了。围绕着他、亲吻着他的还有他自己的子孙们，都是今天头回见到，可是在他看来他们都是陌生人，因为他早已丧失了记忆，头脑变得迟钝了。一个人像老鼠一样被关在黑洞里，竟然能挺过半个世纪之久，真是难以置信，可是他的老伴和几个老朋友都在这里给他作证呢。他们还记得，在他还年轻力壮的时候，他吻了吻孩子，把孩子交到了孩子他娘手里，就一去不复返，杳无音讯了。不用个一二十年，城堡里的人就已经算不出来那人被关了多久，为了个没有记录，也无人记得的罪名；可是这位老伴就记得，他那上了岁数的孩子也记得，那孩子就站在自己也已经成了家的一群儿女当中，拼命想认出自己的父亲，活了大半辈子，父亲对于她只是个名字，一个念头，一个模糊的影子，一个传说，现在突然活生生地站在了她的面前。","And with these words and others, he lightly took his spear and gat him thence.In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves, in the edge of a poor village.He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years; and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now; but to him these were all strangers, his memory was gone, his mind was stagnant.It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat, but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it.They could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood, when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother’s hands and went away into that long oblivion.The people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense; but this old wife knew; and so did her old child, who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name, a thought, a formless image, a tradition, all her life, and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh and blood and set before her face."
"这场面可真够稀奇的，不过我匀出篇幅来描写它，并不是为了这个缘故，而是因为还有一桩更叫我稀奇的事情。那就是，这桩可怕的事件并没能让这些被践踏的人民爆发出对于压迫者的愤怒。他们世世代代受惯了这种残酷和压迫，除了仁慈，什么事他们都见怪不怪了。是的，这确实是件新鲜事，能让人看出这个民族陷入奴役有多深。他们整个人都已经沦落到一种单调而毫无生气的状态，逆来顺受，听天由命，忍气吞声，无论什么降临到头上都默默接受。他们的想象力早已死去了。我估摸，要能这样说一个人，他可真是沉到底了，再也没法往下沉了。","It was a curious situation; yet it is not on that account that I have made room for it here, but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious.To wit, that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against these oppressors.They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness.Yes, here was a curious revelation, indeed, of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery.Their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience, resignation, dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life.Their very imagination was dead.When you can say that of a man, he has struck bottom, I reckon; there is no lower deep for him."
"我真希望当初走别的路就好了。对于一个心里正策划一场和平变革的政治家来说，这种经历可不大合适。因为它免不了会带来一个这样无法回避的事实，那就是，不管怎样满嘴仁义道德和空谈说教，世上没有任何民族是靠着仁义说教和道德说服获取自由的：任何革命要取得成功必须先以流血开始，无论以后会发生什么，这是亘古不变的法则。如果说历史教会了我们点什么，这就是了。所以，这个民族所需要的是暴政的统治，是断头台，对于他们来说我不太合适。","I rather wished I had gone some other road.This was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind.For it could not help bringing up the unget-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion: it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must BEGIN in blood, whatever may answer afterward.If history teaches anything, it teaches that.What this folk needed, then, was a Reign of Terror and a guillotine, and I was the wrong man for them."
"两天以后，接近中午时，桑迪开始显得有点兴奋，热切地期待着什么。她说我们正在接近妖怪的城堡。我吃了一惊，心里不大舒服。此次寻访的目标本来已被我忘在脑后了，它的突然苏醒让它片刻之间变得相当真实，惊心动魄，反倒激起我强烈的兴趣。桑迪的兴奋劲越来越高涨，我也是，因为这种事情是有传染性的。我的心砰砰跳起来。你不能跟你的心说理，它有自己的法则，理智上鄙视的东西它偏偏会砰砰乱跳。不一会儿，桑迪从马上溜了下来，打手势让我停下来，接着她神神秘秘地猫着腰，朝斜坡跟前的一丛灌木走去，头向下弯着几乎都贴到膝盖上了，我的心也越跳越猛，越跳越快。当她一边用眼睛溜着那斜坡，一边靠近躲藏地时，我的心跳得更快了。当我跪着爬到她的身边时，我的心更是跳个不停。这时她两眼放光，用手指着，气喘吁吁地小声说到：","Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy.She said we were approaching the ogre’s castle.I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock.The object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest.Sandy’s excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort of thing is catching.My heart got to thumping.You can’t reason with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which the intellect scorns.Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse, motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker.And they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity; and also while I was creeping to her side on my knees.Her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her finger, and said in a panting whisper:"
"“那个城堡！那个城堡！瞧，就在那里耸立着！”","“The castle!The castle!Lo, where it looms!”"
"我真是又失望又高兴！我说：","What a welcome disappointment I experienced!I said:"
"“城堡？那不过是个猪圈，一个四周围着篱笆的猪圈。”","“Castle?It is nothing but a pigsty; a pigsty with a wattled fence around it.”"
"她看上去很是吃惊，大为沮丧。她脸上的勃勃生气褪去了，好一会儿工夫她都心事重重，一言不发。后来她说：","She looked surprised and distressed.The animation faded out of her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent.Then:"
"“先前这城堡还没被人施魔法呀。”她说这话一副若有所思的样子，仿佛是自言自语，“这等奇事真是太怪异了，太恐怖了——在一个人看来，它被施了魔法，呈现龌龊可耻之态；而在另一个人眼里，它却未受魔法之害，依然如旧，巍峨耸立，坚固如初，四周城壕围绕，塔楼上旗帜映着蓝天随风飘舞。上帝保佑，与那些亲爱的俘虏们再次重逢，目睹她们甜美的面容再舔愁绪，怎能让人不心痛不已！我们一路耽搁，实在当责。”","“It was not enchanted aforetime,” she said in a musing fashion, as if to herself.“And how strange is this marvel, and how awful—that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base and shameful aspect; yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted, hath suffered no change, but stands firm and stately still, girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers.And God shield us, how it pricks the heart to see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces!We have tarried along, and are to blame.”"
"这可把我点醒了。这城堡对我来讲是施了魔法了，而对她来说却不是如此。要把她从错觉中拉出来，纯是浪费时间，也根本不可能，我必须顺着她的话说。于是我说到：","I saw my cue.The castle was enchanted to ME, not to her.It would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn’t be done; I must just humor it.So I said:"
"“这是常有的事——一件东西，对一个人显出施过魔法的样子，而对另一个人还保留它原有的样子。你以前肯定也曾听说过，桑迪，尽管你还没碰巧碰到过。不过这样没什么害处。事实上，这样还是咱们的造化呢。若这些美人在谁眼里都是猪，在她们自己眼里也是猪，那就有必要去破解这个魔法了，而除非能找到这个魔法的诀窍，否则根本不可能。而且这样也很危险，要是没找到真正的诀窍就试图破解魔法，你就很可能会出错，将猪变成狗，将狗变成猫，将猫变成老鼠，等等等等，最终将你手里的东西变成乌有，或者变成你追也追不上的一股无味的气体——当然，那还不是一样。不过，幸运的是，除了我，谁的眼睛也没受魔法的影响，因此破不破它也就没什么影响了。这些美人在你眼里还是美人，对她们自己，对任何人，都是；同时我的错觉也不会给她们带来任何不快，因为我知道表面上看起来是猪，实际上是个美人，这就够了，我就知道该怎么对待她了。”","“This is a common case—the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another.You have heard of it before, Sandy, though you haven’t happened to experience it.But no harm is done.In fact, it is lucky the way it is.If these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves, it would be necessary to break the enchantment, and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment.And hazardous, too; for in attempting a disenchantment without the true key, you are liable to err, and turn your hogs into dogs, and the dogs into cats, the cats into rats, and so on, and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally, or to an odorless gas which you can’t follow—which, of course, amounts to the same thing.But here, by good luck, no one’s eyes but mine are under the enchantment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it.These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to everybody else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion, for when I know that an ostensible hog is a lady, that is enough for me, I know how to treat her.”"
"“啊呀，多谢了，我的大人，您说起话来真真如天使一般。小的知道大人您定会解救她们的，皆因大人您有着侠义心肠，乃是武艺高强的骑士，敢做敢为，堪称举世无双。”","“Thanks, oh, sweet my lord, thou talkest like an angel.And I know that thou wilt deliver them, for that thou art minded to great deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will and to do, as any that is on live.”"
"“桑迪，我是不会任由一位公主呆在猪圈里的。远处那三位在我这出了毛病的眼里是三个瘦骨嶙峋的猪倌——”","“I will not leave a princess in the sty, Sandy.Are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine-herds—”"
"“那些妖怪，他们也变了模样？那可奇怪之极。这倒叫小的心生恐惧了。他们堂堂九腕尺之躯，有五腕尺大人是瞧不到的，那大人如何能确保一击即中呢？啊呀，此行需小心，大人。此次非同小可，实出小人所料。”","“The ogres, Are THEY changed also?It is most wonderful.Now am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible?Ah, go warily, fair sir; this is a mightier emprise than I wend.”"
"“放宽心，桑迪。我只需要知道一个妖怪看不到的部分有多少，然后我就知道如何找到他的致命之处了。别怕，我一下子就能把这些骗子都收拾了。你呆那儿别动。”","“You be easy, Sandy.All I need to know is, how MUCH of an ogre is invisible; then I know how to locate his vitals.Don’t you be afraid, I will make short work of these bunco-steerers.Stay where you are.”"
"桑迪在那儿跪着，面如死尸，不过还有点胆量，满怀希望。我把她留在那里，自己骑着马来到猪圈，跟那几个猪倌做了笔买卖。我总共花了十六便士，将他们所有的猪全买了下来，这让他们感激不尽，这比最近的市场价可高出不少呢。我下手正及时，因为再过一天，教会，领主，还有别的那些收租敛税的，都会随之而来，将大部分家畜一扫而光，留下猪倌没有猪放，桑迪没有公主看。可是，如今收税的人来了，可以给他们现金，除此之外还会有点剩余做投资。这些猪倌当中有个人，有十个孩子，他说去年有个牧师来了，要将他家十口猪中最肥的那头牵走抵什一税，他妻子一下子火冒三丈，将一个孩子塞给他，说道：","I left Sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful, and rode down to the pigsty, and struck up a trade with the swine-herds.I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest quotations.I was just in time; for the Church, the lord of the manor, and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock, leaving the swine-herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses.But now the tax people could be paid in cash, and there would be a stake left besides.One of the men had ten children; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the fattest one for tithes, the wife burst out upon him, and offered him a child and said:"
"“你这黑了心肝的禽兽，我就靠这猪喂养孩子，你拿走了，留下我孩儿做甚？”","“Thou beast without bowels of mercy, why leave me my child, yet rob me of the wherewithal to feed it?”"
"真是奇怪。同样的事情，在我那个时代的威尔士也发生过，同样也是在国教的统治下，许多人还以为国教不会换汤不换药呢。","How curious.The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day, under this same old Established Church, which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise."
"我把这三个人打发走了，接着打开猪圈门，招手让桑迪过来——桑迪就过来了，而且不是悠哉悠哉走过来的，而是跟燎原之火一样蹿过来的。她扑到那些猪身上，高兴得泪流满面，还紧紧将那些猪抱在怀里，又是亲吻又是抚摸，毕恭毕敬地用显赫的公主名字称呼它们，我瞧见了，不禁替她感到害臊，替全人类感到害臊。","I sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and beckoned Sandy to come—which she did; and not leisurely, but with the rush of a prairie fire.And when I saw her fling herself upon those hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them to her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them reverently by grand princely names, I was ashamed of her, ashamed of the human race."
"我们必须把这些猪赶回家去——十英里呢；而且世上再没有女人比这些更任性随心，更固执难拗的了。它们不肯走在大道上，小路也不行，而偏要穿过那些灌木从往四面八方跑，不管东西南北四处游荡，跳过岩石，翻过小山，专捡最难走的地方走。它们还打不得，粗声粗气骂一声也不行，桑迪才不会眼睁睁看着它们受到与它们社会地位不相符的待遇呢。这帮老母猪里最讨厌的那个，你还得称它为“夫人”、“殿下”，跟其余那些一样。身上穿着铠甲还要追在猪屁股后头东奔西跑，真是顶顶讨厌，顶顶困难的了。有一个小小的伯爵小姐，鼻拱上拴了个铁环，背上光秃秃的没长毛，脾气却是犟得不得了。她让我跟她赛跑了一个钟头，跑遍了各个地方，后来却回到了我们的出发点，连一箭之地都没走出去。最后我抓住了她的尾巴，她吱吱尖叫着被我一路拖来。当我撵上桑迪时她吓坏了，说我拖着伯爵小姐的裙摆走，那真是无礼之极。","We had to drive those hogs home—ten miles; and no ladies were ever more fickle-minded or contrary.They would stay in no road, no path; they broke out through the brush on all sides, and flowed away in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest places they could find.And they must not be struck, or roughly accosted; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank.The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my Lady, and your Highness, like the rest.It is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs, in armor.There was one small countess, with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back, that was the devil for perversity.She gave me a race of an hour, over all sorts of country, and then we were right where we had started from, having made not a rod of real progress.I seized her at last by the tail, and brought her along squealing.When I overtook Sandy she was horrified, and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train."
"天刚黑我们就把猪，应该说大部分猪，赶回了家。就是摩根诺的内娄文公主不见了，还有她的两个侍女：也就是，安吉拉·波亨小姐和伊兰·科特曼小姐，前者是头年轻的黑母猪，脑门上有块白斑，后者是棕色的，细腿儿，右侧的前腿稍微有点瘸——赶起这对要命鬼来是要多费劲就有多费劲，我是见识了。　失踪者里头还有几个仅仅是男爵小姐——我倒想让它们永远失踪下去，可是不行，这些做香肠的肉料必须都得找到。于是我们就打发仆人，带上火把，树林里，山岗上，到处搜寻。","We got the hogs home just at dark—most of them.The princess Nerovens de Morganore was missing, and two of her ladies in waiting: namely, Miss Angela Bohun, and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains, the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star in her forehead, and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side—a couple of the tryingest blisters to drive that I ever saw. 　Also among the missing were several mere baronesses—and I wanted them to stay missing; but no, all that sausage-meat had to be found; so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end."
"自然，所有的猪都被安置在家里，哎呀，我的妈！——咳，我从来没见过这样的事。我也从没听说过。从来连嗅都没嗅到过。这就像煤气罐里造反一样。","Of course, the whole drove was housed in the house, and, great guns!— well, I never saw anything like it. 　Nor ever heard anything like it. 　And never smelt anything like it. 　It was like an insurrection in a gasometer."
"第二十一章　朝圣者","CHAPTER 21 The Pilgrims"
"当我最后终于上床睡觉时，我感到无法形容的累，伸伸胳膊腿儿，放松放松紧绷了好久的肌肉，多么舒服，多么惬意！但我也只能做到这个地步了——眼下想睡个觉那是绝对办不到。那帮贵族老是在大厅和走廊里上窜下跳，互相拉扯撕咬，吱哇乱叫，就像群魔再次来到人间，让我半点都睡不着。睡不着，我自然就会想东想西，主要想的是桑迪那些稀奇古怪的幻觉。你瞧她，就像生在这个国家的其他人一样精神正常，可是，从我的角度看，她一举一动就像个疯女人。天啊，灌输的力量！熏陶的力量！教育的力量！那能让一个人变得什么都相信。我得让自己站在桑迪的位置上才能意识到她不是个疯子。是的，她也得站在我的位置上，才能证明一个人，要是没受过你所受的教育，是多么容易把你看成一个疯子。要是告诉桑迪，我见过一辆货车，没有任何魔法相助，一小时能飞跑五十英里；我见过一个人，没有任何魔力，钻进篮子里能蹿上云端，无影无踪；没有任何魔法师的帮忙，我就听到了几百里以外的人说话，桑迪就不仅仅会猜测我是疯子了，她会认准我就是。她周围的人都相信魔法，没人有一丝怀疑；要是怀疑城堡会变成猪圈，里面的人会变成猪，那就如同全康涅狄格州就我一个怀疑电话和电话带来的奇迹是实际存在的东西一样——这两种情形里都有脑子不健全，精神错乱的铁证。是的，桑迪精神很正常，这点不承认不行。如果我也要正常点——对于桑迪来说——我就得让没施魔法也不是奇迹的火车头、热气球和电话等这些我自己的迷信埋在心里不说。此外，我还相信世界不是扁平的，没有柱子在底下托着，也没有罩子把上面满是水的宇宙给隔开了；但是因为在这个国度里就我一个人有毛病，怀有这等不恭不敬、罪大恶极的想法，我意识到这个问题我最好也保持沉默，如果我不希望大家忽地一下子都把我当疯子，见到我就避之不及的话，这才是最明智的做法。","WHEN I did get to bed at last I was unspeakably tired; the stretching out, and the relaxing of the long-tense muscles, how luxurious, how delicious!but that was as far as I could get—sleep was out of the question for the present.The ripping and tearing and squealing of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium come again, and kept me broad awake.Being awake, my thoughts were busy, of course; and mainly they busied themselves with Sandy’s curious delusion.Here she was, as sane a person as the kingdom could produce; and yet, from my point of view she was acting like a crazy woman.My land, the power of training! of influence! of education!It can bring a body up to believe anything.I had to put myself in Sandy’s place to realize that she was not a lunatic.Yes, and put her in mine, to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught.If I had told Sandy I had seen a wagon, uninfluenced by enchantment, spin along fifty miles an hour; had seen a man, unequipped with magic powers, get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds; and had listened, without any necromancer’s help, to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles away, Sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy, she would have thought she knew it.Everybody around her believed in enchantments; nobody had any doubts; to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty, and its occupants into hogs, would have been the same as my doubting among Connecticut people the actuality of the telephone and its wonders,—and in both cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind, an unsettled reason.Yes, Sandy was sane; that must be admitted.If I also would be sane—to Sandy—I must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous locomotives, balloons, and telephones, to myself.Also, I believed that the world was not flat, and hadn’t pillars under it to support it, nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that occupied all space above; but as I was the only person in the kingdom afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions, I recognized that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter, too, if I did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman."
"第二天桑迪将那群猪都集合到饭厅，给它们吃早饭，亲自伺候它们，一举一动无不显示出深为敬重的态度，就如这个岛国的人，从古到今，都敬重有地位的人一样，不管容貌美丑，不管智力高低，人好人坏。　我的出身要是跟我的官位差不多一样高，我就可以和那些猪一起用餐了，可是我没那样的出身，不免受此冷遇，因此也就认了，不发什么牢骚了。我和桑迪在另外一张桌子上吃饭。这家人都出去了。我说道：","The next morning Sandy assembled the swine in the dining-room and gave them their breakfast, waiting upon them personally and manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her island, ancient and modern, have always felt for rank, let its outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may. 　I could have eaten with the hogs if I had had birth approaching my lofty official rank; but I hadn’t, and so accepted the unavoidable slight and made no complaint.Sandy and I had our breakfast at the second table.The family were not at home.I said:"
"“这家有几口人呀，桑迪，他们都住在哪儿呀？”","“How many are in the family, Sandy, and where do they keep themselves?”"
"“这家？”","“Family?”"
"“对呀。”","“Yes.”"
"“哪家呀，我的大人？”","“Which family, good my lord?”"
"“咳，就是这家，你自己家。”","“Why, this family; your own family.”"
"“大人见谅，小的不明白。我没有家。”","“Sooth to say, I understand you not.I have no family.”"
"“没家？咳，桑迪，这难道不是你家吗？”","“No family?Why, Sandy, isn’t this your home?”"
"“这到底是怎么一回事？我没有家。”","“Now how indeed might that be?I have no home.”"
"“哦，那么，这房子是谁的？”","“Well, then, whose house is this?”"
"“啊，请大人明察，要是小的知道，怎会不告诉大人呢。”","“Ah, wit you well I would tell you an I knew myself.”"
"“咳——你连认识都不认识这家人？那是谁请我们来的呢？”","“Come—you don’t even know these people?Then who invited us here?”"
"“没人请我们。　我们不请自来，仅此而已。”","“None invited us. 　We but came; that is all.”"
"“啊呀，你这个女人，这样做太荒唐了。脸皮厚成这样也真让人敬佩。咱们大模大样地走到人家家里，将人家的屋子塞满那些有史以来唯一有真正价值的贵族，结果，我们连人家姓甚名谁都不清楚。你怎么能这么胆大妄为，无法无天？我还以为这自然是你家了。人家会怎么说？”","“Why, woman, this is a most extraordinary performance.The effrontery of it is beyond admiration.We blandly march into a man’s house, and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility the sun has yet discovered in the earth, and then it turns out that we don’t even know the man’s name.How did you ever venture to take this extravagant liberty?I supposed, of course, it was your home.What will the man say?”"
"“他会怎么说？除了说谢谢他还能说甚？”","“What will he say?Forsooth what can he say but give thanks?”"
"“谢什么呢？”","“Thanks for what?”"
"她很吃惊，脸上露出迷惑不解的神情。","Her face was filled with a puzzled surprise:"
"“大人言语甚是奇怪，端的叫小的难解其意。大人敢是做梦哩，咱们带来这等贵客，教他蓬荜生辉，在他有生之年难道还会有此荣幸吗？”","“Verily, thou troublest mine understanding with strange words.Do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace his house withal?”"
"“哦，不错——你要是这么一说。不错，没准儿这还是他头一回受到如此待遇呢。”","“Well, no—when you come to that.No, it’s an even bet that this is the first time he has had a treat like this.”"
"“那就让他千恩万谢，还得谦卑恭敬，致以感激之辞；若不如此，他便是猪狗，祖宗子孙都是猪狗。”","“Then let him be thankful, and manifest the same by grateful speech and due humility; he were a dog, else, and the heir and ancestor of dogs.”"
"在我看来，这个情形可真让人别扭。也许还会让人更别扭。　把那些猪都赶到一起继续往前走也许是个好主意。　于是我说：","To my mind, the situation was uncomfortable.It might become more so.　It might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on. 　So I said:"
"“天色不早了，桑迪。该把那些贵族都聚到一起赶路了。”","“The day is wasting, Sandy.It is time to get the nobility together and be moving.”"
"“这是为何，尊贵的头子大人？”","“Wherefore, fair sir and Boss?”"
"“我们不是要将她们送回家吗？”","“We want to take them to their home, don’t we?”"
"“老天，听听他都说些什么！她们可是来自天南海北，全国各地！每人必须分头送往各自家中；人生何其短暂，你我要是真送，估计人生都要在旅途中度过了；上帝赋予人生命，同时也赋予人死亡，皆是由亚当而起，那厮听从他同伙的劝诱，犯下了原罪；那同伙被人类之大敌所蛊惑蒙骗；那大敌乃是一条巨蟒名唤撒旦，早先也曾被奉为神圣，后却因心中妒火中烧满腔愤恨而离经叛道，做下这等邪恶之事，端的是狼子野心，致使那洁白无暇的天性枯萎霉变，想当年，在那神光万丈的极乐天国，与众兄弟一同嬉戏于芳草地，树荫间，好不快活，生于那富饶极乐之地——”","“La, but list to him!They be of all the regions of the earth!Each must hie to her own home; wend you we might do all these journeys in one so brief life as He hath appointed that created life, and thereto death likewise with help of Adam, who by sin done through persuasion of his helpmeet, she being wrought upon and bewrayed by the beguilements of the great enemy of man, that serpent hight Satan, aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that evil work by overmastering spite and envy begotten in his heart through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature erst so white and pure whenso it hove with the shining multitudes its brethren-born in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein all such as native be to that rich estate and—”"
"“我的天啊！”","“Great Scott!”"
"“大人怎么了？”","“My lord?”"
"“咳，你要知道我们没工夫来这套。你还不明白吗，有那个等你解释我们为什么不能送的工夫，我们早跑遍全世界，把她们一个个送回家了。现在咱们不能光说了，咱们得行动起来。你可得小心点，在这种时候可别再这样满嘴跑舌头了。现在谈点正事吧——简短点说。谁来把这些贵族们送回家呢？”","“Well, you know we haven’t got time for this sort of thing.Don’t you see, we could distribute these people around the earth in less time than it is going to take you to explain that we can’t.We mustn’t talk now, we must act.You want to be careful; you mustn’t let your mill get the start of you that way, at a time like this.To business now—and sharp’s the word.Who is to take the aristocracy home?”"
"“他们还有朋友。这些朋友会从天涯海角赶过来的。”","“Even their friends.These will come for them from the far parts of the earth.”"
"这简直是晴天霹雳，太出人意料了，就像囚犯遇到了大赦一般让人如释重负。她自然是要留下来交接货物了。","This was lightning from a clear sky, for unexpectedness; and the relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner.She would remain to deliver the goods, of course."
"“好了，桑迪，既然我们的事业已经圆满成功了，那么我就能回家去报告了，万一要有别的人——”","“Well, then, Sandy, as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully ended, I will go home and report; and if ever another one—”"
"“小的也准备好了；我同大人一起去。”","“I also am ready; I will go with thee.”"
"这下可把大赦给撤回去了。","This was recalling the pardon."
"“什么？你同我一起走？为什么要跟我走？”","“How?You will go with me?Why should you?”"
"“大人认为小的会做我家骑士的叛徒吗？此乃可耻之行为。小的决不会离开大人的，除非另有骑士与大人场上比武，赢了大人，要带小的走。　小的若想着这等事情发生，岂不是罪过。”","“Will I be traitor to my knight, dost think?That were dishonor.I may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me. 　I were to blame an I thought that that might ever hap.”"
"“这次当选，任期可就长了，”我叹着气自言自语道，“我还是尽力而为吧。”　　于是我提高嗓门说：","“Elected for the long term,” I sighed to myself.“I may as well make the best of it.” 　So then I spoke up and said:"
"“好吧，我们动身吧。”","“All right; let us make a start.”"
"她跟那群猪哭别去了，我趁此机会将这帮贵族都交给了那些仆人。我还要他们拿个鸡毛掸子把那些贵族睡过觉，散过步的主要几个地方都掸掸，但他们却认为这样做有点犯不上，并且太出格了，因此会招来闲话的。出格——那就没什么话说了，这个民族什么罪都能犯，就是不能犯出格的罪。仆人们说他们得守规矩，这规矩自古就有，神圣不可侵犯。他们会在所有的房间和大厅里都撒上新鲜的灯芯草，这样一来就看不到贵族来过的痕迹了。这是对大自然的讽刺：这本是科学家的方法，地质学家的方法，它是把一家子的历史一层一层地存积下来，考古学家可以一层层挖开，通过每个时期留下来的东西来判断这个家庭一百年来在饮食方面有什么变化。","While she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork, I gave that whole peerage away to the servants.And I asked them to take a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged and promenaded; but they considered that that would be hardly worth while, and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom, and therefore likely to make talk.A departure from custom—that settled it; it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that.The servants said they would follow the fashion, a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance; they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls, and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible.It was a kind of satire on Nature: it was the scientific method, the geologic method; it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record; and the antiquary could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years."
"我们当天遇到的头一样东西就是一队朝圣者。他们本不跟我们一路，但是我们还是加入了他们的队伍。如今我常常想，要是我想治国有方，就必须体察民情，不是靠别人，而是亲自观察，细细考察。","The first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims.It was not going our way, but we joined it, nevertheless; for it was hourly being borne in upon me now, that if I would govern this country wisely, I must be posted in the details of its life, and not at second hand, but by personal observation and scrutiny."
"这群朝圣者和乔叟笔下的有点像：几乎代表了那个国家里所有的上等职业和行业，穿着符合各自职业和行业的衣服。这些人有男有女，有老有少，有的活泼有的严肃。他们有的骑着骡子，有的骑着马，上面都没有横鞍，因为要等九百年后英国才会有这种特殊的玩意呢。","This company of pilgrims resembled Chaucer’s in this: that it had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the country could show, and a corresponding variety of costume.There were young men and old men, young women and old women, lively folk and grave folk.They rode upon mules and horses, and there was not a side-saddle in the party; for this specialty was to remain unknown in England for nine hundred years yet."
"这些人待人和气，为人友善，很好相处。他们都很虔诚，开心快乐，行为粗俗却又浑然不觉，言语粗鄙却又天真烂漫。他们来来回回讲那些他们自己当作笑话的东西，一点也不感到难为情，而即使十二个世纪之后英国最上流的人士估计也不过如此。这一长队，一会儿这一个，一会儿那一个，时不时冒出来个只有十九世纪头二十五年那帮才子才能想出来的恶作剧，大家都乐得直喝彩。时不时队伍这头有人说出个俏皮话，就有人往那头传，只见俏皮话如离弦之箭，一路前行，激起一波波哄然大笑，而一头头驴子都羞得面红耳赤。","It was a pleasant, friendly, sociable herd; pious, happy, merry and full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies.What they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best English society twelve centuries later.Practical jokes worthy of the English wits of the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century were sprung here and there and yonder along the line, and compelled the delightedest applause; and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward the other, you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along; and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake."
"桑迪知道这群朝圣者的目的和用意，于是就告诉了我。　她说：","Sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage, and she posted me. 　She said:"
"“他们是奔圣洁谷而来，为了从神圣的隐士那里得到保佑，并喝到神泉水，洗去罪恶。”","“They journey to the Valley of Holiness, for to be blessed of the godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleased from sin.”"
"“那泉水在哪里呢？”","“Where is this watering place?”"
"“此去还得两天路程，就在一个名叫杜鹃国的国境边界处。”","“It lieth a two-day journey hence, by the borders of the land that hight the Cuckoo Kingdom.”"
"“给我讲讲。那是个有名的地方吗？”","“Tell me about it.Is it a celebrated place?”"
"“哦，确实如此，有名。　无人能及。古时便有一位修道院院长带着众修道士居于此地。普天之下也许没有人比这些修道士更为圣洁了，因为他们潜心研读经书，彼此不交一言，也不与外人搭话，除了枯腐的草药什么也不吃，很少睡觉，整天祈祷，从不洗浴；一件衣衫不到年久烂掉，自行从身体脱落，决不更换。全仗着如此虔诚苦修他们才闻名天下，世人不论贫富皆来造访，无不肃然起敬。”","“Oh, of a truth, yes. 　There be none more so.Of old time there lived there an abbot and his monks.Belike were none in the world more holy than these; for they gave themselves to study of pious books, and spoke not the one to the other, or indeed to any, and ate decayed herbs and naught thereto, and slept hard, and prayed much, and washed never; also they wore the same garment until it fell from their bodies through age and decay.Right so came they to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities, and visited by rich and poor, and reverenced.”"
"“接着说。”","“Proceed.”"
"“只是谷中一直缺水。一日，那位神圣的修道院院长朝天祈祷，果然有应，一大股清泉奇迹般从那不毛之地霍然喷出。谁知那些修道士意志不坚，被魔鬼所诱，不断缠着院长苦苦哀求，定要院长建个浴池；院长被磨不过，无法拒绝，只得说就如你们所愿吧，然后就依了他们。您瞧，这岂不是违拗天意，摒弃世俗之礼。众修道士进入浴池，洗得洁白如雪；正在这时，上帝突然显灵惩戒众人！而那受了污染的泉水不再流淌，完全消失了。”","“But always there was lack of water there.Whereas, upon a time, the holy abbot prayed, and for answer a great stream of clear water burst forth by miracle in a desert place.Now were the fickle monks tempted of the Fiend, and they wrought with their abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct a bath; and when he was become aweary and might not resist more, he said have ye your will, then, and granted that they asked.Now mark thou what ’tis to forsake the ways of purity the which He loveth, and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense.These monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as white as snow; and lo, in that moment His sign appeared, in miraculous rebuke! for His insulted waters ceased to flow, and utterly vanished away.”"
"“太便宜他们了，桑迪，想想看吧，在这个国家洗澡可不是小罪过。”","“They fared mildly, Sandy, considering how that kind of crime is regarded in this country.”"
"“兴许是吧，不过此系初犯，众修道士多年以来一直品行完美无暇，与天使无异。他们祷告，哭泣，折磨自己的肉体，无论做什么都是徒劳，泉水再也不会流出。甚至于列队巡行，甚至于焚香祭祀，甚至于向圣母燃烛许愿，都无济于事；举国上下无不啧啧称奇。”","“Belike; but it was their first sin; and they had been of perfect life for long, and differing in naught from the angels.Prayers, tears, torturings of the flesh, all was vain to beguile that water to flow again.Even processions; even burnt-offerings; even votive candles to the Virgin, did fail every each of them; and all in the land did marvel.”"
"“多么奇怪啊，就连这样的产业也会有金融恐慌，有时候还要眼睁睁看着土地券和美元变成废纸，百业不兴。继续，桑迪。”","“How odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics, and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero, and everything come to a standstill.Go on, Sandy.”"
"“一天天过去了，春去冬来，有一天，那位有德行的长老终于恭顺地屈服了，毁掉了浴池。瞧，此刻上帝的怒火立即平息了，泉水再度汩汩地涌了出来，直到如今还一如既往地喷涌着。”","“And so upon a time, after year and day, the good abbot made humble surrender and destroyed the bath.And behold, His anger was in that moment appeased, and the waters gushed richly forth again, and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure.”"
"“那么，我猜从那之后再也没人洗澡了吧。”","“Then I take it nobody has washed since.”"
"“凡有敢来洗浴者，绳索伺候，对，立即拿下，决不拖延。”","“He that would essay it could have his halter free; yes, and swiftly would he need it, too.”"
"“修道院从此就昌盛了吧？”","“The community has prospered since?”"
"“就从当天起。　奇迹声名远播，传遍四面八方。修道士从全国各地赶来相聚，他们如鱼群般成团结队而来；修道院不断修建房屋，盖了又盖，展开双臂，一一收纳。修女们也来了，来了一批又一批。于是在山谷那边，正对着男修道院，也盖起了房屋，盖了又盖，把女修道院建得煞是宏伟壮观。修道士与修女甚为交好，齐心合力，一同在山谷之间建造了一所宏大的育婴堂。”","“Even from that very day. 　The fame of the miracle went abroad into all lands.From every land came monks to join; they came even as the fishes come, in shoals; and the monastery added building to building, and yet others to these, and so spread wide its arms and took them in.And nuns came, also; and more again, and yet more; and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the vale, and added building to building, until mighty was that nunnery.And these were friendly unto those, and they joined their loving labors together, and together they built a fair great foundling asylum midway of the valley between.”"
"“你刚才不是提到几位隐士来着，桑迪。”","“You spoke of some hermits, Sandy.”"
"“他们从天涯海角来到那里。哪里有成群的朝圣者，哪里的隐士就增加得最为迅速。那里的隐士形形色色，什么样的都有。谁要是说起哪类隐士是世间罕见，只有在有些偏远奇异之地方可寻得，就让他来到这圣洁谷旁，将沿线的大小山洞沼泽扒拉扒拉，无论是何等出身，怀有何等技能，一定能在那儿找出个样品来。”","“These have gathered there from the ends of the earth.A hermit thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims.Ye shall not find no hermit of no sort wanting.If any shall mention a hermit of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far strange land, let him but scratch among the holes and caves and swamps that line that Valley of Holiness, and whatsoever be his breed, it skills not, he shall find a sample of it there.”"
"我身边有个壮汉，胖乎乎的脸，脾气很好的样子，我凑了上去，想套套近乎，再从他那里打听出点什么来；可我刚跟他搭上话，他就迫不及待而又笨嘴拙腮地掉转话头，像祖祖辈辈一样，要把话朝那个老掉牙的故事上引——就是狄纳丹爵士给我讲的那个，我还因为萨格拉摩爵士硬要给我讲这个故事而和他有了过节，结果他还向我挑战。　我赶紧找个借口躲到了队伍的末尾，满心悲伤，真想远离这烦恼的人生，脱离这苦海，短短人生，却不见安宁，只见乌云密布，暴雨狂风，屡屡奋挣，却总以失败告终；可是一想改变，却又未免退缩，因为想起来生漫漫，而无数讲那故事的人也早已先我而去了。","I closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored face, purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further crumbs of fact; but I had hardly more than scraped acquaintance with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up, in the immemorial way, to that same old anecdote—the one Sir Dinadan told me, what time I got into trouble with Sir Sagramor and was challenged of him on account of it. 　I excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession, sad at heart, willing to go hence from this troubled life, this vale of tears, this brief day of broken rest, of cloud and storm, of weary struggle and monotonous defeat; and yet shrinking from the change, as remembering how long eternity is, and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote."
"刚过中午，我们就撵上了另一队朝圣者，可这一队无论老少，没一个高兴的，没一个说笑话的，没有人嘻嘻哈哈，打打闹闹，也没人乐昏了头。不过这队人也是有老有少；有头发灰白的老头子老太婆，有身强力壮的中年男女，有年轻的小夫妻，有小男孩小女孩，还有三个抱在怀里吃奶的孩子。就连小孩子都没半点笑脸；这五十个人里头没有一个不是拉着个脸，顶着一副绝望的表情，一看就是饱经苦难，早就心灰意冷的人。他们都是奴隶。他们戴着脚镣手铐，腰间拴着一根鞋底皮做的皮带子，脚镣手铐和皮带用铁链子拴在一起；除了孩子，所有人都用一根套在脖子上的铁链拴成一串，彼此间隔六英尺。他们都是步行，十八天走了三百英里，吃得都是残汤剩菜，而且还吃不饱。每天晚上他们都要带着这些锁链睡觉，像猪似的被捆在一起。他们身上挂了些破布，但那根本不能算是衣服。他们的脚腕被脚镣蹭破了皮，都已经溃烂成疮，甚至都生了蛆。光着的脚受了伤，没有一个人走起道来不一瘸一拐的。原先这群苦命人有一百来个，但途中卖了一半。管他们的那个奴隶贩子骑在马上，手持一条短把的鞭子，鞭梢又长又沉，末端还分了几个叉，打着疙瘩。谁要是累得痛得站不稳了，他就用那根鞭子抽那人的肩膀，叫他站直了。他不说话，他也不用说话，鞭子就可以替他传情达意。我们骑马走过的时候，这群可怜虫没一个抬头看看我们的，他们像是根本就没意识到我们的存在。他们只发出一种声音，那就是沉重而可怕的哐啷哐啷的铁链声，长长的一大队，从头到尾，四十三双带着铁镣的脚整齐划一地抬起落下。这一队人走在自己制造的云雾之中。","Early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims; but in this one was no merriment, no jokes, no laughter, no playful ways, nor any happy giddiness, whether of youth or age.Yet both were here, both age and youth; gray old men and women, strong men and women of middle age, young husbands, young wives, little boys and girls, and three babies at the breast.Even the children were smileless; there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down, and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair.They were slaves.Chains led from their fettered feet and their manacled hands to a sole-leather belt about their waists; and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart, by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line.They were on foot, and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days, upon the cheapest odds and ends of food, and stingy rations of that.They had slept in these chains every night, bundled together like swine.They had upon their bodies some poor rags, but they could not be said to be clothed.Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were ulcerated and wormy.Their naked feet were torn, and none walked without a limp.Originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates, but about half had been sold on the trip.The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end.With this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain, and straightened them up.He did not speak; the whip conveyed his desire without that.None of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by; they showed no consciousness of our presence.And they made no sound but one; that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file, as forty-three burdened feet rose and fell in unison.The file moved in a cloud of its own making."
"人人脸上都是灰的，罩着一层灰尘。在没人住的房子里，你一定见过家具上也有这样一层灰，还闲着没事用指头在上面写过字呢。一看到那几个妇女的脸，我就想起这事来了，年轻的妈妈怀抱着奄奄一息，即将获得解脱的孩子，满怀的心事就写在她们脸上的灰尘里，明明白白，天啊，再明白不过了！因为那是泪水的痕迹。这些年轻的母亲里，有一个还是个小姑娘呢，看到她脸上的泪痕，我就心疼，不由得想到，这么个孩子，照理还不懂得人世的艰辛，还正处在生命的清晨，怎么会从她的肺腑之中流露出这样的感触，而且毫无疑问——","All these faces were gray with a coating of dust.One has seen the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses, and has written his idle thought in it with his finger.I was reminded of this when I noticed the faces of some of those women, young mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom, how a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their faces, plain to see, and lord, how plain to read! for it was the track of tears.One of these young mothers was but a girl, and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing, and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child, a breast that ought not to know trouble yet, but only the gladness of the morning of life; and no doubt—"
"正在这时，她累得头晕眼花，一个踉跄，立刻鞭子就抽了过来，从她光着的肩膀上揭下一层皮。这一鞭刺痛了我，就好像抽在我身上一样。那个主人要那队人停下，自己从马上跳了下来。他大发雷霆，咒骂着这个女孩，说她偷懒耍滑，真是烦死人了，还说以后再不会有机会了，还是现在就把帐清了吧。　那女孩扑通跪下，举起双手，连哭带喊，苦苦哀求，吓得魂不附体，可是那个主人也一点也不为所动。他一把从她怀里夺走了孩子，又叫拴在她身前和身后的男奴隶把她推倒在地，按住了她，把衣服掀起来；接着他就疯子似地用鞭子狠命抽打，直到把她的后背抽得皮开肉绽，真是可怜，姑娘给抽得连声尖叫，苦苦挣扎。有个按住她的男人掉过了脸去，就为了这份慈悲心肠，他也挨了顿鞭打和臭骂。","She reeled just then, giddy with fatigue, and down came the lash and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder.It stung me as if I had been hit instead.The master halted the file and jumped from his horse.He stormed and swore at this girl, and said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness, and as this was the last chance he should have, he would settle the account now. 　She dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg, and cry, and implore, in a passion of terror, but the master gave no attention.He snatched the child from her, and then made the men-slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body; and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed, she shrieking and struggling the while piteously.One of the men who was holding her turned away his face, and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged."
"所有的朝圣者都在一旁观看，品头论足——评论这条鞭子运用得是多么纯熟。他们自出世以来就跟奴隶制度朝夕相处，司空见惯，心肠早就变硬了，看不出这场表演除了“纯熟”之外还有什么可评论的。将人类情感中能称为优秀的部分都给僵化掉，这就是奴隶制度所为，因为这些朝圣者都是些心地善良的人，要有人这么对待他们的马匹，他们才不会答应呢。","All our pilgrims looked on and commented—on the expert way in which the whip was handled.They were too much hardened by lifelong everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything else in the exhibition that invited comment.This was what slavery could do, in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior lobe of human feeling; for these pilgrims were kind-hearted people, and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that."
"我想要制止这件事，并把奴隶都放了，不过这样可不成。　我不能干涉太多，落下个凌驾国家法律和公民权力的名声。要是我还有口气，混得还不错，我定会要了奴隶制的命，我已经下定了决心。不过我一定要把事情安排妥当，要由全国人民一齐下令再去办它的死罪。","I wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free, but that would not do. 　I must not interfere too much and get myself a name for riding over the country’s laws and the citizen’s rights roughshod.If I lived and prospered I would be the death of slavery, that I was resolved upon; but I would try to fix it so that when I became its executioner it should be by command of the nation."
"就在那路旁有个铁匠铺，在离这个地方还有好几英里的时候，有个地主买下了这个姑娘，说好在这里交货，为的是能在这儿把铁链摘下来。　铁链摘下来了，这位绅士又和货主起了争执，为的是谁来付铁匠钱。铁链一摘下来，这姑娘就猛然扑到了刚才她受鞭打时把脸扭过去的那个男人的怀里，发疯似地哭成了个泪人。他将她搂在怀里，密不透风地吻着她和孩子的脸，泪如雨下，冲刷着他们。我觉得有点可疑。我就去询问了一下。果然，我猜对了，他们是夫妻俩。他们靠生拉硬拽才被分开，那姑娘是被拖走的，一路像疯了似的挣扎撕打，高声尖叫，直到拐了个弯才看不见了。过了好一会儿，虽然尖叫声渐渐远去，我们依然能够听出里面的哀怨。妻子和孩子走了，那位当丈夫和父亲的，今生今世是不是再也看不到他们了呢？——唉，我实在不忍心看他的模样，只好转过头去，但是我明白自己再也无法将他的影子从心中抹去了，直到今天，只要一想起来，我的心就一阵绞痛。","Just here was the wayside shop of a smith; and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back, deliverable here where her irons could be taken off.　They were removed; then there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith.The moment the girl was delivered from her irons, she flung herself, all tears and frantic sobbings, into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped.He strained her to his breast, and smothered her face and the child’s with kisses, and washed them with the rain of his tears.I suspected.I inquired.Yes, I was right; it was husband and wife.They had to be torn apart by force; the girl had to be dragged away, and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight; and even after that, we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding shrieks.And the husband and father, with his wife and child gone, never to be seen by him again in life?—well, the look of him one might not bear at all, and so I turned away; but I knew I should never get his picture out of my mind again, and there it is to this day, to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it."
"夜幕刚刚降临，我们就住进了村子里的一家小旅馆。第二天早上，当我起了床，放眼一望，看到一位骑士披着金灿灿的朝霞，策马而来，我认出他是我手下的骑士——旷世硬汉奥扎纳爵士。他做的是男士服饰生意，专门使命就是推销帽子。他全身上下都裹着钢铁，穿着当时最漂亮的铠甲——一直穿到该戴头盔的地方，不过他没戴头盔，而是戴了一顶闪闪发光的烟囱式的帽子，那场面要多搞笑就有多搞笑。　这是我的另一项秘密计划，为了消灭骑士制度，让他们显得奇形怪状、荒谬之极。奥扎纳爵士的马鞍上挂满了装帽子的皮革盒子，每次只要他征服了一个游侠骑士，他就逼人家发誓为我效犬马之劳，还给人家做顶帽子戴上。我穿上衣服跑了出去，迎接奥扎纳爵士，听听他带来的消息。","We put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall, and when I rose next morning and looked abroad, I was ware where a knight came riding in the golden glory of the new day, and recognized him for knight of mine—Sir Ozana le Cure Hardy.He was in the gentlemen’s furnishing line, and his missionarying specialty was plug hats.He was clothed all in steel, in the beautifulest armor of the time—up to where his helmet ought to have been; but he hadn’t any helmet, he wore a shiny stove-pipe hat, and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see.　It was another of my surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd.Sir Ozana’s saddle was hung about with leather hat boxes, and every time he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made him wear it.I dressed and ran down to welcome Sir Ozana and get his news."
"“生意怎么样？”我问道。","“How is trade?” I asked."
"“大人您看，只剩这四顶了，从卡米洛出发的时候我可是带了十六顶呢。”","“Ye will note that I have but these four left; yet were they sixteen whenas I got me from Camelot.”"
"“哎呀，你干得可真不赖，奥扎纳爵士。最近你在什么地方发财来着？”","“Why, you have certainly done nobly, Sir Ozana.Where have you been foraging of late?”"
"“启禀大人，我刚刚从圣洁谷来。”　","“I am but now come from the Valley of Holiness, please you sir.”"
"“我也正要到那里走一趟。修道院里有什么非同寻常的事情发生吗？”","“I am pointed for that place myself.Is there anything stirring in the monkery, more than common?”"
"“端的不消问得！……伙计，快好好喂喂我的马，若有不周，仔细你的脑袋。马上去马厩，按我吩咐的做……大人，小的带来一条不祥的消息，而且——这些人都是来朝圣的吗？那再好不过了，诸位请聚拢过来，一起听我叙说其详，因为这也与诸位相关，此行一去，诸位定是白跑一趟，一无所获，小的所言可用性命担保，且听我一一道来：二百年前，圣洁谷曾祸从天降，人人都道是空前绝后，谁知如今又灾难重降，上天为了训诫我等，事非偶然——”","“By the mass ye may not question it!....Give him good feed, boy, and stint it not, an thou valuest thy crown; so get ye lightly to the stable and do even as I bid....Sir, it is parlous news I bring, and—be these pilgrims?Then ye may not do better, good folk, than gather and hear the tale I have to tell, sith it concerneth you, forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find, and seek that ye will seek in vain, my life being hostage for my word, and my word and message being these, namely: That a hap has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years, which was the first and last time that that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by commandment of the Most High whereto by reasons just and causes thereunto contributing, wherein the matter—”"
"“神泉的水又不流了！”二十位朝圣者异口同声地叫了起来。","“The miraculous fount hath ceased to flow!” This shout burst from twenty pilgrim mouths at once."
"“诸位所言极是。我正要讲，却被你们一语道破。”","“Ye say well, good people.I was verging to it, even when ye spake.”　"
"“敢是又有人洗澡了？”","“Has somebody been washing again?”"
"“非也，有些怀疑，但谁也不信。想来必是有别的什么罪孽，只是无人知晓罢了。”","“Nay, it is suspected, but none believe it.It is thought to be some other sin, but none wit what.”"
"“对此灾难大家有何感触？”","“How are they feeling about the calamity?”"
"“无人能用言语说个明白。泉水已经干涸九天了。　从那时祷告便开始了，大家披麻撒灰，痛哭哀伤，巡行瞻礼，日日夜夜不曾停息。修道士和那些修女弃婴们俱已精疲力尽，只得将祷文写在羊皮纸上张挂起来，因为众人连提声说话的力气都没有了。最后大家只好派人来找您了，请头子施展魔法。如果大人您不能前往，就要派使者请默林了，如今他已到了有三日了，他声言自己定要召来神泉，即使天崩地裂，国破家亡也在所不惜。他施起法术来甚是勇猛，召出天魔地煞前来相助，可惜他没日没夜辛苦操劳，除却自己流得那桶臭汗，却连一丝湿气也没生出来，便是拿面铜镜来，也不会教它起一点水气。大人若是——”","“None may describe it in words.The fount is these nine days dry. 　The prayers that did begin then, and the lamentations in sackcloth and ashes, and the holy processions, none of these have ceased nor night nor day; and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings be all exhausted, and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment, sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice.And at last they sent for thee, Sir Boss, to try magic and enchantment; and if you could not come, then was the messenger to fetch Merlin, and he is there these three days now, and saith he will fetch that water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish it; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his hellions to hie them hither and help, but not a whiff of moisture hath he started yet, even so much as might qualify as mist upon a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task; and if ye—”"
"早饭准备好了。一吃完早饭，我就给奥扎纳爵士看我写在他帽子里面的几个字：化学部，实验室分理处，G.Pxxp部门。 送两个头号的，两个三号的，六个四号的，连同一应配件——再把我那些训练有素的助手派两位来。然后我又说：","Breakfast was ready.As soon as it was over I showed to Sir Ozana these words which I had written on the inside of his hat: Chemical Department, Laboratory extension, Section G. Pxxp.  Send two of first size, two of No. 3, and six of No. 4, together with the proper complementary details—and two of my trained assistants. And I said:"
"“现在你赶紧飞速赶往卡米洛，勇敢的骑士，把这给克拉伦斯瞧瞧，告诉他把我要的东西火速送到圣洁谷。”","“Now get you to Camelot as fast as you can fly, brave knight, and show the writing to Clarence, and tell him to have these required matters in the Valley of Holiness with all possible dispatch.”"
"“好的，头子。”他说着就离开了。","“I will well, Sir Boss,” and he was off."

"周六中午我到井边看了一会儿。默林还在那里烧着冒烟的药末儿，两手在空中乱抓一气，嘴里还和以前一样卖力地叽叽咕咕念着咒语，不过看起来却很是灰心丧气，当然了，因为他到目前为止还没有从井里变出一丝水汽来。　最终我开口说道：","SATURDAY noon I went to the well and looked on a while.Merlin was still burning smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and muttering gibberish as hard as ever, but looking pretty down-hearted, for of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet. 　Finally I said:"
"“到现在事情成功的希望有多大，伙计？”","“How does the thing promise by this time, partner?”"
"“你瞧，我正努力施法呢，施的是东方玄妙大法师最厉害的法术,要是这还不成，那就无计可施了。别说话，等我施完。”","“Behold, I am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands of the East; an it fail me, naught can avail.Peace, until I finish.”"
"这次他搞出一股烟雾来，把这一带都弄得天昏地暗，而且没准儿还让那些隐士觉得不舒服了，因为风是朝他们那边吹的，卷着滚滚的浓烟，朝着他们的洞穴刮去。　与此同时他还嘴里滔滔不绝念个不停，身子扭来扭去，两手在空中夸张地胡乱比划着。二十分钟后，他气喘吁吁地停了下来，精疲力尽。此时，修道院院长带着几百位修道士和修女赶了过来，后面还跟着成群的朝圣者和黑压压一片的弃儿，都是被那遮天蔽日的黑烟吸引来的，个个都兴奋的不得了。修道院院长急忙打听结果如何。默林说道：","He raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region, and must have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits, for the wind was their way, and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and billowy fog. 　He poured out volumes of speech to match, and contorted his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary way.At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting, and about exhausted.Now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks and nuns, and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of acres of foundlings, all drawn by the prodigious smoke, and all in a grand state of excitement.The abbot inquired anxiously for results.Merlin said:"
"“如果束缚泉水的魔咒真的能为人力所破，那我刚才所为早就能破了它。　不过未能奏效。因此我现在终于明白以前所虑之事果然是真的。这次失败表明，东方大法师能够识别的那个最厉害的妖怪，那个谁提起他的名字就要没命的妖怪，正是他对这口井下了魔咒。知道破这个魔咒口诀的人，不但现在没有，将来也不会有，而没有这个口诀就没人能破这魔咒。　泉水永远也不会再流了，神父大人。我已经使尽人间招数。就放我走吧。”","“If any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these waters, this which I have but just essayed had done it. 　It has failed; whereby I do now know that that which I had feared is a truth established; the sign of this failure is, that the most potent spirit known to the magicians of the East, and whose name none may utter and live, has laid his spell upon this well.The mortal does not breathe, nor ever will, who can penetrate the secret of that spell, and without that secret none can break it. 　The water will flow no more forever, good Father.I have done what man could.Suffer me to go.”"
"当然了，这使得修道院院长惊慌失措。他朝我转过头来，满脸惊慌，对我说：","Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation.He turned to me with the signs of it in his face, and said:"
"“您都听到了吧。这是真的吗？”","“Ye have heard him.Is it true?”"
"“有些话是真的。”","“Part of it is.”"
"“那么，就是说不全是了，不全是！哪句是真的呢？”","“Not all, then, not all!What part is true?”"
"“就是那句，说顶着个俄语名字的妖怪给这口井下了魔咒。”","“That that spirit with the Russian name has put his spell upon the well.”"
"“老天保佑，那么我们就没救了！”","“God’s wownds, then are we ruined!”"
"“也许吧。”","“Possibly.”"
"“不过不是一定没救？您的意思是，不是一定没救？”","“But not certainly?Ye mean, not certainly?”"
"“没错。”","“That is it.”"
"“因此，当他说没人能破这个魔咒时，您的意思是——”","“Wherefore, ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell—”"
"“不错，他那么说，也不一定就是真的。有些情况下，只要努力破咒还是有希望的——也就是说，有一点点，一丝丝希望——成功。”","“Yes, when he says that, he says what isn’t necessarily true.There are conditions under which an effort to break it may have some chance—that is, some small, some trifling chance—of success.”"
"“有些情况是——”","“The conditions—”"
"“哦，这没什么难办的。只要做到这几样：今天日落之后，这口井及其方圆半英里以内，不准任何人进入，直到我解除禁令为止——而且未经我的同意，任何人不得走过这个地方。”","“Oh, they are nothing difficult.Only these: I want the well and the surroundings for the space of half a mile, entirely to myself from sunset to-day until I remove the ban—and nobody allowed to cross the ground but by my authority.”"
"“就这些吗？”","“Are these all?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“你对这次尝试毫不畏惧？”","“And you have no fear to try?”"
"“哦，不害怕。当然，谁都有可能失败；不过，谁也都有可能成功。试试总可以，我准备去碰碰运气。　你能答应我的条件吗？”","“Oh, none.One may fail, of course; and one may also succeed.One can try, and I am ready to chance it. 　I have my conditions?”"
"“别说这几件，多少件也依你。我一定下令照办。”","“These and all others ye may name.I will issue commandment to that effect.”"
"“等等，”默林说道，脸上露出一抹邪恶的笑容，“要破除这个魔咒，必须知道那妖怪的名字，你可知道？”","“Wait,” said Merlin, with an evil smile.“Ye wit that he that would break this spell must know that spirit’s name?”"
"“不错，我知道他的名字。”","“Yes, I know his name.”"
"“那你可否明白，光知道名字还不成，还得能说出来？哈哈！这个你知道吗？”","“And wit you also that to know it skills not of itself, but ye must likewise pronounce it?Ha-ha! Knew ye that?”"
"“是的，这个我也知道。”","“Yes, I knew that, too.”"
"“这个你也知晓！难不成你是个傻瓜？你难道想说出名字来送死吗？”","“You had that knowledge!Art a fool?Are ye minded to utter that name and die?”"
"“说出来？嗨，那是当然了。即使是个威尔士名字，我也会说出来的。”","“Utter it?Why certainly.I would utter it if it was Welsh.”"
"“那么，你必死无疑了，我要去禀告亚瑟王。”","“Ye are even a dead man, then; and I go to tell Arthur.”"
"“行啊。你赶紧拎包走人吧。你应该马上回家，干预报天气的行当，约翰·威·默林。”","“That’s all right.Take your gripsack and get along.The thing for YOU to do is to go home and work the weather, John W. Merlin.”"
"这下子可戳中默林的要害了，弄得他直皱眉头，因为全国就数他预测天气最不准了。只要他下命令在海边打起危险信号，保准这一个周都风平浪静，而每次他预报天气晴朗，老天又会下起瓢泼大雨。可是我依然一直把他留在气象局，为的是毁坏他的声誉。可是，我这么一说，激得他肝火上升，反倒不动身回家给我报丧了，他说自己就呆在这儿看我出丑。","It was a home shot, and it made him wince; for he was the worst weather-failure in the kingdom.Whenever he ordered up the danger-signals along the coast there was a week’s dead calm, sure, and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats.But I kept him in the weather bureau right along, to undermine his reputation.However, that shot raised his bile, and instead of starting home to report my death, he said he would remain and enjoy it."
"晚上我的那两位专家到了，两人因为日夜兼程赶路，都累坏了。他们随行带着骡子，把我需要的东西都驮来了——各种工具，水泵，铅管，希腊火，一捆捆大火箭，罗马烟火筒，彩色喷火器，电动装备，还有一大堆杂七杂八的玩意儿——创造最为壮观的奇迹所需要的一切都准备好了。他们吃完晚饭，小睡了一会儿，到了夜半时分，我们就出发了，四周空无一人，万籁俱寂，甚至都超出了我要求的条件。我们占据了水井和井周围的地方。我的那些小伙子们都是行家里手，从砌井到制造数学仪器，方方面面都是。太阳升起的前一个钟头，我们用补船的方法把漏水的地方修好了，水开始流了出来。接着我们在小教堂里藏了焰火，锁上门，就回家睡觉了。","My two experts arrived in the evening, and pretty well fagged, for they had traveled double tides.They had pack-mules along, and had brought everything I needed—tools, pump, lead pipe, Greek fire, sheaves of big rockets, roman candles, colored fire sprays, electric apparatus, and a lot of sundries—everything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle.They got their supper and a nap, and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions.We took possession of the well and its surroundings.My boys were experts in all sorts of things, from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument.An hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in ship-shape fashion, and the water began to rise.Then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel, locked up the place, and went home to bed."
"中午弥撒还没做完，我们就又回到了井边，因为还有事情要做呢，而且从做生意的角度出发，我决定在午夜前施展那个奇迹：因为，如果说在平常日子为教会弄个奇迹是桩好买卖的话，那么你要是在礼拜日干，那价值就能翻上六倍。用了九个小时井水就升到了往常的高度——也就是说，离井口还有不到二十三英尺。　我们往井里放了一根小小的铁质水泵，那是京城附近我的那家工厂出产的第一批水泵；接着我们在水井小屋墙外的石头水池里凿了个洞，插进一段铅管，长度正好到小礼拜堂的门口，从门槛底下伸出来。我是这么打算的，在这个神圣的小山包前有片平地，到时候准有能占二百五十公顷地的人到场，泉水一从那儿涌出来，他们就可以看得清清楚楚。","Before the noon mass was over, we were at the well again; for there was a deal to do yet, and I was determined to spring the miracle before midnight, for business reasons: for whereas a miracle worked for the Church on a week-day is worth a good deal, it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a Sunday.In nine hours the water had risen to its customary level—that is to say, it was within twenty-three feet of the top. 　We put in a little iron pump, one of the first turned out by my works near the capital; we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the well-chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold, where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people I was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time."
"我们把一个大空桶的上部分敲掉，然后将它吊在小礼拜堂的平屋顶上，固定紧，往桶底倒火药，松松的一层，有一英寸厚，接着我们往桶里插火箭，插得密密实实，但又互相不挨着，各种各样的火箭都有。我可以告诉你，那一大把火箭粗粗壮壮，壮观极了。　我们又在火药里插了根小电池的电线，在屋顶的每一个角里都放了一整筒希腊火——一个角放蓝色的，一个角放绿色的，一个角放红色的，最后一个角放紫色的——每个角还都插了一根电线。","We knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel, where we clamped it down fast, poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom, then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could loosely stand, all the different breeds of rockets there are; and they made a portly and imposing sheaf, I can tell you. 　We grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder, we placed a whole magazine of Greek fire on each corner of the roof—blue on one corner, green on another, red on another, and purple on the last—and grounded a wire in each."
"在离门口二百码远的平地上，我们用木头搭建了一个围栏，有四英尺高，上面铺上木板，搭起了一个看台。我们还专门借了些漂亮的花毯铺在上面，再把修道院院长的宝座往上一放。当你要在一个无知的种族面前卖弄神通的时候，总是想要把每个细节都用上，你想要所有的道具在观众眼里都十分震撼，你想要让你的首席嘉宾舒舒服服的，那样你就可以放开手脚，尽情发挥了。我很了解这些事情的价值，因为我熟悉人的秉性。在显神通的时候就应该尽力铺排。这样是有点费神费力，有时还费钱，不过末了还是有回报的。　我们把电线从小教堂的屋顶引下来，然后从地下引到看台，将电池藏在看台上。我们接着又用一根绳子将看台方圆一百英尺围了起来，将平民百姓都挡在外面，这样我们就算完工了。我的想法是，十点半开门，十一点二十五分准时开演。我很想卖门票，可是这当然不成。我吩咐我的伙计们十点就要来到小教堂，赶在人都没来之前做好准备，时辰一到就操纵水泵搞它个翻江倒海。　然后我们就回家吃晚饭去了。","About two hundred yards off, in the flat, we built a pen of scantlings, about four feet high, and laid planks on it, and so made a platform.We covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion, and topped it off with the abbot’s own throne.When you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race, you want to get in every detail that will count; you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye; you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest; then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth.I know the value of these things, for I know human nature.You can’t throw too much style into a miracle.It costs trouble, and work, and sometimes money; but it pays in the end. 　Well, we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel, and then brought them under the ground to the platform, and hid the batteries there.We put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude, and that finished the work.My idea was, doors open at 10:30, performance to begin at 11:25 sharp.I wished I could charge admission, but of course that wouldn’t answer.I instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10, before anybody was around, and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time, and make the fur fly. 　Then we went home to supper."
"此时，关于水井要遭难的消息已是远近皆知；这两三天，人们犹如持续的雪崩般不断涌进山谷。山谷低洼那头已经成了一片巨大的露营地，我们准会卖个满座，毫无疑问。天刚擦黑，我就派人四处吆喝，说我马上就要大显神通了，这个消息让大家都心跳加快，热血沸腾。那些吆喝的人还通知大家说，修道院院长和他的随从人员会在十点半大驾光临，在看台就座，在那之前所有我下了禁令的地方都不得有人进入，院长就座后，钟声就会停止，这个信号表示平民百姓可以一拥而入，占据他们的位置了。","The news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time; and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been pouring into the valley.The lower end of the valley was become one huge camp; we should have a good house, no question about that.Criers went the rounds early in the evening and announced the coming attempt, which put every pulse up to fever heat.They gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and occupy the platform at 10:30, up to which time all the region which was under my ban must be clear; the bells would then cease from tolling, and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and take their places."
"我在看台上一心一意要接驾，可修道院院长一行人前呼后拥已经来到我的眼前——那天晚上连个星星也没有，黑漆漆一片，而且也不允许用火把，所以他们都快到绳子围着的地方我才看到。默林也跟在后面来了，还在看台前排坐下了，这次他可是说话算话了。那些被禁令隔在外面的民众，我们是看不到的，不过不用看也知道他们就在那儿。钟声一停，那些隔在外面的人群就呼啦啦散开，象一大片黑色的潮水般涌过了警戒线，这股人潮持续了半个小时之久才慢慢平静下来，人头攒动，仿佛铺成了一条人行道，你可以在上面走——嘿，走好几英里。","I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbot’s solemn procession hove in sight—which it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence, because it was a starless black night and no torches permitted.With it came Merlin, and took a front seat on the platform; he was as good as his word for once.One could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban, but they were there, just the same.The moment the bells stopped, those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave, and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow, and then it solidified itself, and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to—well, miles."
"此时，我们先来了个二十分钟左右的冷场——我靠着这个来产生效果，吊吊观众的胃口总是没什么坏处的。最终，一支拉丁语圣歌打破了寂静——都是男人的声音——那曲调庄严宏伟，如潮水般划破了夜空，一路涌来，翻腾不已。这也是我事先安排好的，是我所创造的效果最好的一次。歌声一停下来，我就从看台上站起身来，向两边伸出双手，同时仰起脸来——这样总能让大家鸦雀无声——接着我慢慢用吓人的声音念出那可怕的咒语，让成百上千的人都浑身颤抖，还有很多女人都晕了过去：","We had a solemn stage-wait, now, for about twenty minutes—a thing I had counted on for effect; it is always good to let your audience have a chance to work up its expectancy.At length, out of the silence a noble Latin chant—men’s voices—broke and swelled up and rolled away into the night, a majestic tide of melody.I had put that up, too, and it was one of the best effects I ever invented.When it was finished I stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad, for two minutes, with my face uplifted—that always produces a dead hush—and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble, and many women to faint:"
"“君士坦丁诺坡利坦尼斯哥丢戴尔萨克斯普菲芬马彻尔斯哥赛尔斯加夫特！”","“Constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft!”"
"我一边哼哼着这段咒语的结尾几个词，一边摁了一下电门，那片黑压压的人群一下子就暴露在可怕而耀眼的蓝色光芒下！这效果真是巨大啊！许多人发出尖叫，女人们则抱头四处逃窜，成群结队的弃儿们瘫倒在地。修道院院长与修道士们都纷纷用手飞快地划着十字，嘴唇颤个不停，一个劲儿地祷告。默林还沉得住气，不过他也从头到脚吓了一跳，以前他可从未看过这样的开场。现在是时候把效果一股脑儿地抖出来了。我举起手来，哼哼出这个咒语——好像很痛苦的样子：","Just as I was moaning out the closing hunks of that word, I touched off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare!It was immense—that effect!Lots of people shrieked, women curled up and quit in every direction, foundlings collapsed by platoons.The abbot and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers.Merlin held his grip, but he was astonished clear down to his corns; he had never seen anything to begin with that, before.Now was the time to pile in the effects.I lifted my hands and groaned out this word—as it were in agony:"
"“尼亥利森戴纳米忒艾特凯斯琛普尔”——随即我又摁出了红色火焰！","“Nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen!?—and turned on the red fire!"
"当那深红色的地狱之火与蓝色魔光交织在一起的时候，犹如大西洋般一望无际的人群就发出了痛苦的呻吟和嚎叫，可惜你没听到！过了六十秒钟，我又喊道：","You should have heard that Atlantic of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue!After sixty seconds I shouted:"
"“德兰士瓦尔图盆忒盆德兰士波特忒拉姆珀西尔特拉波尔德拉翁斯斯拉恩忒拉戈迪！”——接着我又点燃了绿色的火焰！","“Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenentragoedie!?—and lit up the green fire!"
"这次只等了四十秒钟，我就展开双臂，雷鸣般吼出了咒语之王中那几个毁灭性的字眼儿：","After waiting only forty seconds this time, I spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating syllables of this word of words:"
"“麦卡穆斯曼恁马森门琛摩尔德摩仁姆特尔马摩尔莫努门特马彻！”——随后紫色的魔光就像旋风般射了出来！","“Mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher!?—and whirled on the purple glare!"
"现在，红的，蓝的，绿的，紫的，四种颜色，一齐发射，交相辉映！——仿佛四座火山，喷出大团大团的烟火，四射腾空，五彩缤纷，无所不在，把整个山谷都照得如同令人目眩的正午。你可以看到远处柱子上那个家伙倚天而立，一动不动，二十年来他的拉锯运动头一回停了下来。我知道那些小伙子们此时正在水泵边上，一切就绪了。于是我对修道院院长说道：","There they were, all going at once, red, blue, green, purple!—four furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft, and spreading a blinding rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley.In the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid against the background of sky, his seesaw stopped for the first time in twenty years.I knew the boys were at the pump now and ready.So I said to the abbot:"
"“时辰到了，神父。我马上就要念出那可怕的名字，让咒语化为乌有。你得打起精神来，扶着点什么东西才成。”　　随后我就对着人群喊道：“注意，再过一分钟咒语就该破了，要是破不了，那就不是凡人能够办到的了。要是破了，大家都会看到的，因为你们能看到圣水从教堂门口喷出来！”","“The time is come, Father.I am about to pronounce the dread name and command the spell to dissolve.You want to brace up, and take hold of something.” 　Then I shouted to the people: “Behold, in another minute the spell will be broken, or no mortal can break it.If it break, all will know it, for you will see the sacred water gush from the chapel door!”"
"我站了一会儿，好让那些听到的人将我的话传给那些没听到的，一直传到最远的那排，然后我又格外卖力地装模作样，比比划划，嘴里喊着：","I stood a few moments, to let the hearers have a chance to spread my announcement to those who couldn’t hear, and so convey it to the furthest ranks, then I made a grand exhibition of extra posturing and gesturing, and shouted:"
"“请看，我要命令那占据圣泉的恶妖现在将他体内残留的地狱之火悉数吐入空中，马上解除他的咒语，逃回地狱去，在那里我要镇他一千年。我用他自己的可怕名字来发布命令——柏格乌力吉克克克！”","“Lo, I command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain to now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still remain in him, and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence to the pit, there to lie bound a thousand years.By his own dread name I command it—BGWJJILLIGKKK!”"
"随后我就点燃了那一大桶火箭，一束束火焰象是巨大的喷泉，又有如一杆杆金光闪闪的长矛，射向苍穹，嘶嘶作响，在半空爆裂，仿佛下了一场光芒四射的宝石雨！人海中发出了一阵恐怖的呻吟，地动山摇——接着突然又发出了欣喜若狂的赞美上帝的声音——因为借着那可怕的魔光，他们分明看到解放了的泉水奔流而出！老修道院长一个字也说不出来，因为他已经老泪纵横，气噎喉头，他一声不响地将我搂在怀里，都快把我挤碎了。这一下胜过千言万语。而且也很难恢复，因为在这个国家，连值一个破镍币的医生都很难找得出来。","Then I touched off the hogshead of rockets, and a vast fountain of dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a hissing rush, and burst in mid-sky into a storm of flashing jewels!One mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people—then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joy—for there, fair and plain in the uncanny glare, they saw the freed water leaping forth!The old abbot could not speak a word, for tears and the chokings in his throat; without utterance of any sort, he folded me in his arms and mashed me.It was more eloquent than speech.And harder to get over, too, in a country where there were really no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel."
"你真该看看，那漫山遍野的人投身到泉水中，将泉水亲了又亲，摩挲着它，爱抚着它，还将它当个人似的跟它说话，用对自己心爱之人的称呼喊着它，欢迎它回来，就好像它是失散多年的老朋友，如今又回来了。哎，这可真值得一看，而且还让我改变了以前对他们的看法。","You should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it; kiss it, and pet it, and fondle it, and talk to it as if it were alive, and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings, just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost, and was come home again.Yes, it was pretty to see, and made me think more of them than I had done before."
"我派人用一块窗板将默林送回家去。在我念出那个骇人名字的那一刻，他就崩溃了，像山体崩塌一样瘫倒在地，再也没有苏醒。他以前从未听过这个名字——我也没听过——不过在他听来我说得丝毫不差。　随便胡诌个名字都不会错的。　他后来承认，就连妖怪的亲妈来念那个名字也不会比我念得更好。他一辈子都不会明白，为什么我说出那个名字后还能不死，我也没告诉他。只有那些乳臭未干的魔法师才会将秘密这样泄露出去呢。默林花了三个月的时间，大施魔法，想要找出如何才能念出名字而又不死的秘诀。可是他始终没达到目的。","I sent Merlin home on a shutter.He had caved in and gone down like a landslide when I pronounced that fearful name, and had never come to since.He never had heard that name before,—neither had I—but to him it was the right one. 　Any jumble would have been the right one. 　He admitted, afterward, that that spirit’s own mother could not have pronounced that name better than I did.He never could understand how I survived it, and I didn’t tell him.It is only young magicians that give away a secret like that.Merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it.But he didn’t arrive."
"当我朝着小教堂走去的时候，老百姓们纷纷脱下帽子，恭恭敬敬地闪到一边，为我让出一条大路来，就好像我是个活神仙似的——我也的确是个活神仙。我意识到了这点。我带了一帮修道士去值夜班，将水泵的奥妙教给了他们，吩咐他们抽水，因为很显然外头那帮人大多数都会守着泉水整夜不睡，为此让他们如愿以偿也是理所应当的。对于那些修道士来说，水泵本身就是个奇迹，他们对此充满了好奇；水泵用起来效力斐然，也令他们赞不绝口。","When I started to the chapel, the populace uncovered and fell back reverently to make a wide way for me, as if I had been some kind of a superior being—and I was.I was aware of that.I took along a night shift of monks, and taught them the mystery of the pump, and set them to work, for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were going to sit up with the water all night, consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted of it.To those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle itself, and they were full of wonder over it; and of admiration, too, of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance."
"这个夜晚真是非比寻常，惊天动地。我也算是一夜成名。　为此我欣喜若狂，辗转难眠。","It was a great night, an immense night.There was reputation in it.　I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it."
"第二十四章　魔法师对手","CHAPTER 24 A Rival Magician"
"如今我在圣洁谷的影响力可谓如日中天。要是能借助它去做点有益的事情，似乎值得一试。我是在第二天早上想到这点的，当我看到我的一位推销肥皂的骑士骑着马走了过来，就计上心来。据史料记载，两百年前这个地方的修道士六根还未清净，还想洗澡来着。生出这种邪念的引子也许还在。于是我探了探一位弟兄的口气，说道：","MY influence in the Valley of Holiness was something prodigious now.It seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable account.The thought came to me the next morning, and was suggested by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come riding in.According to history, the monks of this place two centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash.It might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still remaining.So I sounded a Brother:"
"“你不想洗个澡吗？”","“Wouldn’t you like a bath?”"
"一想到洗澡——一想到洗澡会给那眼井带来的风险——他就颤抖起来——不过他还是很动情地说：","He shuddered at the thought—the thought of the peril of it to the well—but he said with feeling:"
"“此事不消得问，可怜我等自从孩提之时便从未经历这等爽心乐事。　上帝如果应允，小的定要洗浴一番！可是不成啊，大人，此系戒律，不要引诱小的。”","“One needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy. 　Would God I might wash me!but it may not be, fair sir, tempt me not; it is forbidden.”"
"随后他一声长叹，无限悲伤，于是我就下定决心，定要把他身上的不动产洗掉一层，哪怕搭上我所有的影响力，哪怕倾家荡产。因此我就到修道院院长那里，为这位老兄求情。他一听这个主意，吓得脸都白了——我不是说你能看到他的脸变白了，因为除非你把他的脸刮一刮，否则根本看不到，而我才不想费劲儿去刮呢，不过我知道刮不刮都一样，那层白色就在那儿，上面的表皮有书皮那么厚——不但变白了，还哆嗦着呢。他说道：","And then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that I was resolved he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed, if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile.So I went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this Brother.He blenched at the idea—I don’t mean that you could see him blench, for of course you couldn’t see it without you scraped him, and I didn’t care enough about it to scrape him, but I knew the blench was there, just the same, and within a book-cover’s thickness of the surface, too—blenched, and trembled.He said:"
"“啊呀，我的孩子，你还是提点别的要求吧，你只要说，都依你，我等定会知恩图报的——但是这个要求，噢，偏偏是这个要求！难不成你想让圣水又断流吗？”","“Ah, son, ask aught else thou wilt, and it is thine, and freely granted out of a grateful heart—but this, oh, this!Would you drive away the blessed water again?”"
"“不是的，神父，我不是想让它断流。自有天机教我得知上次搞错了，不是大家认为的那样，泉水不流是因为修建浴池之故。”　这位老人家的脸上开始流露出非常感兴趣的表情。“那天机告诉我，浴池对于那场灾祸是无辜的，是另一桩罪恶引发了灾祸。”","“No, Father, I will not drive it away.I have mysterious knowledge which teaches me that there was an error that other time when it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain.” 　A large interest began to show up in the old man’s face.“My knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune, which was caused by quite another sort of sin.”"
"“这番话可真够狂妄的——不过——不过如果确实如此，那倒是求之不得了。”","“These are brave words—but—but right welcome, if they be true.”"
"“确实如此，千真万确。神父，让我把浴池重建起来吧。让我把它重建起来，而泉水也会世世代代流下去的。”","“They are true, indeed.Let me build the bath again, Father.Let me build it again, and the fountain shall flow forever.”"
"“你能保证？——你真能保证？这话你再说一遍——说你能保证！”","“You promise this?—you promise it?Say the word—say you promise it!”"
"“我的确能够保证。”","“I do promise it.”"
"“那么我要第一个给自己洗洗！去吧——赶快开工吧。不要耽搁了，不要耽搁了，赶紧走吧。”","“Then will I have the first bath myself!Go—get ye to your work.Tarry not, tarry not, but go.”"
"我和我的伙计们马上就开干起来。旧浴池的那些拆下来的材料都还堆在修道院的地窖里，一块石头也没少。一代又一代，那些石头就这样堆着，大家都把它们当成不祥之物，唯恐避之不及。我们用了两天就完工了，水也放了进来——宽阔的水池里满是清澈见底的泉水，简直可以在里面游泳了。而且，还是活水呢。水通过那旧水管流进来，又通过旧水管流出去。老院长也没有食言，第一个下去尝试。他下去时，浑身乌黑，哆哆嗦嗦，让上面那群也是遍体乌黑的人忧心忡忡，提心吊胆，心里满是不祥的预感。但是老院长上来时回身雪白，喜笑颜开，战争胜利了！我又打了次胜仗。","I and my boys were at work, straight off.The ruins of the old bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery, not a stone missing.They had been left just so, all these lifetimes, and avoided with a pious fear, as things accursed.In two days we had it all done and the water in—a spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in.It was running water, too.It came in, and went out, through the ancient pipes.The old abbot kept his word, and was the first to try it.He went down black and shaky, leaving the whole black community above troubled and worried and full of bodings; but he came back white and joyful, and the game was made! another triumph scored."
"圣洁谷这一仗我们打得漂亮，我非常满意，现在准备继续上路了，可是却碰到了一件扫兴的事。我得了重感冒，引发了早就潜藏的老风湿。当然了，这次风湿找到了我身体最虚弱的部位，就在那儿扎根了。这个部位就是老院长用胳膊搂着我挤压的地方，就是那次他为了表达感激之情拥抱我的地方。","It was a good campaign that we made in that Valley of Holiness, and I was very well satisfied, and ready to move on now, but I struck a disappointment.I caught a heavy cold, and it started up an old lurking rheumatism of mine.Of course the rheumatism hunted up my weakest place and located itself there.This was the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me, what time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace."
"当我终于死里逃生时，我瘦得只剩个影子了。不过人人对我都殷勤备至，亲切友好，这又让我的生活快乐起来，而这也正是帮助病人早日康复并恢复体力的良药，于是我很快就康复了。","When at last I got out, I was a shadow.But everybody was full of attentions and kindnesses, and these brought cheer back into my life, and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again; so I gained fast."
"桑迪因为照顾我早已疲惫不堪，因此我打定主意要一个人出去游历一番，将她留在修女院里好好休息休息。我的想法是把自己装扮成一个农民阶层的自由人，徒步在这个国家游荡一两个周。这样我就有机会和最底层、最贫苦的自由公民同吃同住，平等相处。不然，没有其他方式能让我彻底了解他们的日常生活和约束着他们生活的法律。　如果我作为一个绅士行走于他们之中，就会有种种限制和传统习俗制约着，使我无法了解他们心中的快乐和苦恼，我就只能接触到表层的一些东西了。","Sandy was worn out with nursing; so I made up my mind to turn out and go a cruise alone, leaving her at the nunnery to rest up.My idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree and wander through the country a week or two on foot.This would give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest class of free citizens on equal terms.There was no other way to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation of the laws upon it. 　If I went among them as a gentleman, there would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out from their private joys and troubles, and I should get no further than the outside shell."
"一天早上，为了强身健体，为下次旅行做准备，我溜了好长一个弯，爬上了靠近最北边山谷的那个山梁，突然发现在一处不很高的悬崖壁上有个人工凿成的洞，根据洞的位置我认出来了，那就是曾有人远远指给我看的那个洞，里面住着那位因蓬头垢面、苦心修行而闻名的隐士。我知道最近有人在大撒哈拉沙漠给他找了个位置，那里的狮子和沙蝇会使他的隐士生活格外有意思，也格外艰难，他已经到非洲上任去了，所以我就想进去看看，瞧瞧这个洞穴的情况跟外面传言的是不是一样。","One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip, and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley, when I came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice, and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity.I knew he had lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara, where lions and sandflies made the hermit-life peculiarly attractive and difficult, and had gone to Africa to take possession, so I thought I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation."
"我可是大吃一惊：这个地方刚被打扫冲洗过。接着我又吓了一跳。在这黑咕隆咚的山洞后面，我听到了铃声在叮当作响，然后就是这样的喊声：","My surprise was great: the place was newly swept and scoured.Then there was another surprise.Back in the gloom of the cavern I heard the clink of a little bell, and then this exclamation:"
"“喂，总机！是你吗，卡米洛？瞧呀，你要是相信奇迹总是伪装成出人意料的样子，而且无处不在的话，一定会乐开了怀——咱们尊贵的头子本人就站在我面前，你还能亲耳听到他说话呢！”","“Hello Central!Is this you, Camelot?Behold, thou mayst glad thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible places—here standeth in the flesh his mightiness The Boss, and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak!”"
"现在，好一个乾坤大逆转，完全不搭边的东西都搅合到一起来了，这才是异想天开，把势同水火、完全不相容的东西都扯到一块儿了——一直生产冒牌奇迹的地方居然产出了真正的奇迹，一个中世纪隐士的洞穴变成了电话局！","Now what a radical reversal of things this was; what a jumbling together of extravagant incongruities; what a fantastic conjunction of opposites and irreconcilables—the home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one, the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office!"
"这位接线员走到亮处，我才认出来他是我手下的一个年轻小伙子。我说道：","The telephone clerk stepped into the light, and I recognized one of my young fellows.I said:"
"“这个电话局建在这儿多久了，尤尔福斯？”","“How long has this office been established here, Ulfius?”"
"“回禀头子大人，今天半夜刚建起来。　我们瞧见这个山谷里灯火通明，因此断定此地适合设置营业所，这里灯火既然如此之多，说明这个城镇规模一定不小。”","“But since midnight, fair Sir Boss, an it please you. 　We saw many lights in the valley, and so judged it well to make a station, for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size.”"
"“非常正确。这不是一般意义上的城镇，不过不管怎么说，它也是个不错的戏台子。你知道自己现在身在何处吗？”","“Quite right.It isn’t a town in the customary sense, but it’s a good stand, anyway.Do you know where you are?”"
"“这个我还没来得及问，因为我的同伴都去干活去了，将这里交给我负责。我因为身体疲倦，想休息一下，等睡醒了再去打听，将地名上报给卡米洛，以便登记备案。”","“Of that I have had no time to make inquiry; for whenas my comradeship moved hence upon their labors, leaving me in charge, I got me to needed rest, purposing to inquire when I waked, and report the place’s name to Camelot for record.”"
"“哦，这里是圣洁谷。”","“Well, this is the Valley of Holiness.”"
"这话却没什么效果，我是说，他听到这个名字并没有吓一跳，而我还以为他能大吃一惊呢。他只是说：","It didn’t take; I mean, he didn’t start at the name, as I had supposed he would.He merely said:"
"“我就这么报上去了。”","“I will so report it.”"
"“啊呀，最近这里发生的奇迹早就轰动四方了！你都没听说吗？”","“Why, the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late wonders that have happened here!You didn’t hear of them?”"
"“啊，大人您应该记得吧，我们都是夜间行动，也不与人搭话。　除了通过电话从卡米洛得到点消息外，其他一概不知。”","“Ah, ye will remember we move by night, and avoid speech with all. 　We learn naught but that we get by the telephone from Camelot.”"
"“啊呀，这事他们可知道得一清二楚。有一个圣泉泉水复流了，这么大个奇迹他们一点都没跟你提起吗？”","“Why THEY know all about this thing.Haven’t they told you anything about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain?”"
"“哦，那个呀？确实提起过。　不过这个山谷的名字可跟那个的名字不一样，简直是天壤之别——”","“Oh, THAT?Indeed yes. 　But the name of THIS valley doth woundily differ from the name of THAT one; indeed to differ wider were not pos—”"
"“那么，那个山谷叫什么名字呢？”","“What was that name, then?”"
"“欠洁谷。”","“The Valley of Hellishness.”"
"“这下就清楚了。　不过还是要骂一下电话。该死的电话，传个发音差不多的字，意思却差了十万八千里，超乎想象。不过不要紧，你现在还是知道这个地方的名字了。给卡米洛打个电话。”","“THAT explains it.　Confound a telephone, anyway.It is the very demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of divergence from similarity of sense.But no matter, you know the name of the place now.Call up Camelot.”"
"他就打了，把克拉伦斯喊来了。能再一次听到我那小伙计的声音真是不错。就好像回到家里一样。我们彼此亲亲热热地问候了几句，讲了讲我最近得病的事，然后我就问道：","He did it, and had Clarence sent for.It was good to hear my boy’s voice again.It was like being home.After some affectionate interchanges, and some account of my late illness, I said:"
"“有什么新闻吗？”","“What is new?”"
"“此时，国王携王后和众朝臣正要动身去你那个山谷，对你恢复流水的那个圣泉进行膜拜，洗去他们的罪恶，还要瞧瞧那个恶魔将真正的地狱之火喷入云端的地方——要是你仔细听，你也许能听出我在眨眼睛，而且还能听出我在笑呢，因为是我亲自从存货里挑选出那些焰火，并按您的命令派人送去的。”","“The king and queen and many of the court do start even in this hour, to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have restored, and cleanse themselves of sin, and see the place where the infernal spirit spouted true hell-flames to the clouds—an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile, sith ’twas I that made selection of those flames from out our stock and sent them by your order.”"
"“国王认得来这里的路吗？”","“Does the king know the way to this place?”"
"“国王？——不认得，恐怕去他国土任何地方的路都不认得；不过助你施展魔法的小伙子会给他当向导，为他引路，还会指定正午在哪里休息，晚上在哪里投宿。”","“The king?—no, nor to any other in his realms, mayhap; but the lads that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way, and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night.”"
"“这么一来他们就能到这儿了——什么时候来？”","“This will bring them here—when?”"
"“后天吧，下半响，或者再晚点。”","“Mid-afternoon, or later, the third day.”"
"“还有什么别的新闻吗？”","“Anything else in the way of news?”"
"“根据你的建议，国王已经开始招募常备军了，已经招满了一个团，军官也指定好了。”","“The king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested to him; one regiment is complete and officered.”"
"“胡闹！那件事我打算自己来主持的。这个国家有资格当正规军军官的人可不多。”","“The mischief!I wanted a main hand in that myself.There is only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a regular army.”"
"“不错——而且你一定会奇怪的，那个兵团里一个西点军校出身的都没有。”","“Yes—and now ye will marvel to know there’s not so much as one West Pointer in that regiment.”"
"“你说什么？此话当真？”","“What are you talking about?Are you in earnest?”"
"“句句属实。”","“It is truly as I have said.”"
"“啊呀，这可真让我大为不安。都选了谁，怎么选的？通过竞争考核？”","“Why, this makes me uneasy.Who were chosen, and what was the method?Competitive examination?”"
"“我确实不知道怎么选的。我只知道这点——这些军官都出自贵族家庭，生来就是——你管它叫什么来着？——傻瓜蛋。”","“Indeed, I know naught of the method.I but know this—these officers be all of noble family, and are born—what is it you call it?—chuckleheads.”"
"“事情不大对头，克拉伦斯。”","“There’s something wrong, Clarence.”　　"
"“大人权且放宽心，因为有两位中尉候选人也要跟国王一同前来——都是年轻的贵族——您只要在这儿等着，就能听到他们怎样面试了。”","“Comfort yourself, then; for two candidates for a lieutenancy do travel hence with the king—young nobles both—and if you but wait where you are you will hear them questioned.”"
"“这才是我要的新闻。无论如何我也要安插个西点军校的进去。找个人骑上马到那个学校送个信，如若必要，马跑死几匹都行，但是在天黑前要他务必赶到那里，叫他说——”","“That is news to the purpose.I will get one West Pointer in, anyway.Mount a man and send him to that school with a message; let him kill horses, if necessary, but he must be there before sunset to-night and say—”"
"“大可不必。我早已将电线从地下接到了那个学校。待小的将电话与你接通便是了。”","“There is no need.I have laid a ground wire to the school.Prithee let me connect you with it.”"
"这话听起来真是舒心！能用上电话，刹那间就和远在千里的人通话，在这种氛围之下我憋屈了许久的心现在终于可以重新呼吸到生活的气息了。紧接着我就意识到，这些年来，这个国家对我而言是多么令人毛骨悚然，多么单调沉闷，缺乏生气，多么令人恐惧，而我的心灵长期处于窒息的环境下，逐渐对此习以为常，几乎都没有能力注意到这点了。","It sounded good!In this atmosphere of telephones and lightning communication with distant regions, I was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation.I realized, then, what a creepy, dull, inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years, and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it."
"我亲自给军校的主管下了命令。我要他给我带些纸，一支自来水笔和一两盒安全火柴。我有点受够了没有这些小便利而将就的日子。如今我可以随身带着它们了，因为我眼下不用穿铠甲，因此就可以够得着衣服口袋了。","I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally.I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches.I was getting tired of doing without these conveniences.I could have them now, as I wasn’t going to wear armor any more at present, and therefore could get at my pockets."
"我回到修道院时，正赶上一件有趣的事儿。院长和众修道士都聚集在大厅里，看着一位新来的魔法师表演，大家都毕恭毕敬，像孩子一样好奇。这位魔法师的穿着极为稀奇古怪，那件东西花里胡哨，十分可笑，就好像驱邪治病的印第安巫医穿的那样。他正皱着个眉头，嘴里咕咕哝哝，指手画脚，一会儿朝天一会儿指地，划着鬼符——这你也知道，还是老一套。他是个来自亚洲的赫赫有名的人物——这是据他自己所说的，这就足够了。这类证据就跟金子一样好用，走到哪儿都行得通。","When I got back to the monastery, I found a thing of interest going on.The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall, observing with childish wonder and faith the performances of a new magician, a fresh arrival.His dress was the extreme of the fantastic; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian medicine-man wears.He was mowing, and mumbling, and gesticulating, and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor,—the regular thing, you know.He was a celebrity from Asia—so he said, and that was enough.That sort of evidence was as good as gold, and passed current everywhere."
"要按照这个家伙定的条件，当个大魔法师也太容易，太不值钱了。他的拿手好戏就是告诉你，地球上的某个人此刻正在做什么，过去的什么时候他做过什么，将来的某个时刻他要做什么。他问大家有没有人想知道东方的皇帝此时正在干什么？大伙儿一个个都眼睛发亮，兴奋地摩拳擦掌，这就是最有力的回答——这群可敬的人当然都想知道那位君主此时此刻正在做什么。这个骗子又表演了几出可笑的把戏，然后一本正经地宣布道：","How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow’s terms.His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment; and what he had done at any time in the past, and what he would do at any time in the future.He asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of the East was doing now?The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer—this reverend crowd WOULD like to know what that monarch was at, just as this moment.The fraud went through some more mummery, and then made grave announcement:"
"“此时此刻，那位至高无上的东方皇帝正将钱放入一个虔诚的化缘修士手中——一枚，两枚，三枚，全都是银币。”","“The high and mighty Emperor of the East doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friar—one, two, three pieces, and they be all of silver.”"
"四周响起了一片赞叹声：","A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out, all around:"
"“端的奇妙！”　“太神奇了！”　　“不知怎样的勤学苦练才能成就如此之神力！”","“It is marvelous!”　“Wonderful!”　“What study, what labor, to have acquired a so amazing power as this!”"
"想不想知道印度尼西亚的君主正在做什么？不错。　他就告诉他们印度尼西亚的君主正在干什么。接着他又告诉他们埃及的苏丹正在干什么，还有远海的国王正在干什么。如此这般，他每抖搂一件这般不可思议的事，大家就越惊奇，他为何能如此料事如神。大伙儿觉得他早晚会在不知哪个地方卡壳，可是没有，他没有一丝犹豫，没有不知道的，而且总是说得丝毫不差。我看出来，事情照这样发展下去，我至高无上的地位可就保不住了，这个家伙准会把我的追随者都抢走，留我一个人坐冷板凳。我必须阻住他前进的车轮，还得马上。　于是我说道：","Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing?Yes. 　He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing.Then he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at; also what the King of the Remote Seas was about.And so on and so on; and with each new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher.They thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time; but no, he never had to hesitate, he always knew, and always with unerring precision.I saw that if this thing went on I should lose my supremacy, this fellow would capture my following, I should be left out in the cold.I must put a cog in his wheel, and do it right away, too.　I said:"
"“如果可以请教，我很想知道有个人眼下在做什么。”","“If I might ask, I should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing.”"
"“说吧，但说不妨。我会告诉你的。”","“Speak, and freely.I will tell you.”"
"“这可有点难——几乎不太可能。”","“It will be difficult—perhaps impossible.”"
"“我法术无边，无所不晓。越是难以揭晓，越是预料准确。”","“My art knoweth not that word.The more difficult it is, the more certainly will I reveal it to you.”"
"你瞧，我就要激起大家的兴致来了。大家此时也的确兴致勃勃，你看那周围的人一个个都伸长了脖子，大气也不出。于是我此时趁机将大家的兴致推向高潮：","You see, I was working up the interest.It was getting pretty high, too; you could see that by the craning necks all around, and the half-suspended breathing.So now I climaxed it:"
"“要是你不出什么错的话——要是你真能把我想知道的事情说出来——我就送你两百银便士。”","“If you make no mistake—if you tell me truly what I want to know—I will give you two hundred silver pennies.”"
"“那笔钱是我的了！你想知道什么我都告诉你。”","“The fortune is mine!I will tell you what you would know.”"
"“那么请告诉我，我的右手现在正在做什么。”","“Then tell me what I am doing with my right hand.”"
"“啊呀！”　　大家都倒抽一口冷气，纷纷惊叫起来。这帮人从未想过——这么简单的招数，不是打听千里之外的人，而是身边的人，在干什么。这下可给了那位魔法师当头一棒，他以前从没碰到过这么紧急的情况，这可把他难住了，不知道该如何接招儿。他看起来惊呆了，很是迷惑，一个字也说不出来。“说呀，”我说道，“你在等什么？世上可能有这样的事吗，问你地球那边的人在干什么，你能立即就回答出来，而问你不到三码远的人在干什么，你却说不出来？站在我身后的人都知道我的右手在干什么——你要是说对了，他们可以作证。”　　他还是一言不发。“很好，我来告诉你为什么你不开口说话吧，因为你压根就不知道。你也算是个魔法师！各位朋友，这个流浪汉只不过是个骗子，是个撒谎精。”","“Ah-h!” 　There was a general gasp of surprise.It had not occurred to anybody in the crowd—that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who wasn’t ten thousand miles away.The magician was hit hard; it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before, and it corked him; he didn’t know how to meet it.He looked stunned, confused; he couldn’t say a word.“Come,” I said, “what are you waiting for?Is it possible you can answer up, right off, and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing, and yet can’t tell what a person is doing who isn’t three yards from you?Persons behind me know what I am doing with my right hand—they will indorse you if you tell correctly.” 　He was still dumb.“Very well, I’ll tell you why you don’t speak up and tell; it is because you don’t know.YOU a magician!Good friends, this tramp is a mere fraud and liar.”"
"那些修道士一听此言，吓得惊慌失措，魂飞魄散。这等了不起的人物也会挨骂，他们还不大适应，也不知道骂完了会有什么后果。此时这里一片寂静，人人都感觉凶多吉少。那位魔法师开始回过神来了，不一会儿脸上就露出了满不在乎而又若无其事的微笑，让大家大大地松了口气，因为这说明他的心情还没有糟糕透顶。他说道：","This distressed the monks and terrified them.They were not used to hearing these awful beings called names, and they did not know what might be the consequence.There was a dead silence now; superstitious bodings were in every mind.The magician began to pull his wits together, and when he presently smiled an easy, nonchalant smile, it spread a mighty relief around; for it indicated that his mood was not destructive.He said:"
"“这厮的狂妄之言真让我无语了。诸位如果还有人不知道的话，请听清楚了，像我这等大法师，除却天子帝王这类显贵之人，是不屑于过问其他人的事情的。你要是问我伟大的国王亚瑟在做什么，那就是另一码事了，我定会告知于你；但是区区子民的所作所为我可不感兴趣。”","“It hath struck me speechless, the frivolity of this person’s speech.Let all know, if perchance there be any who know it not, that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of any but kings, princes, emperors, them that be born in the purple and them only.Had ye asked me what Arthur the great king is doing, it were another matter, and I had told ye; but the doings of a subject interest me not.”"
"“哦，我误会你了。我以为你说的是‘任何人’，所以我推测‘任何人’就包括——嗐，就是任何人，也就是说，每一个人。”","“Oh, I misunderstood you.I thought you said ‘anybody,’ and so I supposed ‘anybody’ included—well, anybody; that is, everybody.”"
"“正是——任何出身高贵的人；若是皇家血脉就更好了。”","“It doth—anybody that is of lofty birth; and the better if he be royal.”"
"“那个，依本人愚见，此言有理，”修道院院长一看有机会缓和气氛，避祸消灾，就开口说话了，“上天降此奇才，绝不可能是为揭示那些生于贵人之下的低等草民之事。吾王亚瑟——”","“That, it meseemeth, might well be,” said the abbot, who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster, “for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness.Our Arthur the king—”"
"“你想知道关于他的事情？”那个魔法师插嘴说到。","“Would you know of him?” broke in the enchanter."
"“非常乐意，如蒙赐教，不胜感激。”","“Most gladly, yea, and gratefully.”"
"马上大家就充满了敬畏，兴致也上来了，这群无可救药的白痴。他们全神贯注地看着他念咒，还瞅了我一眼，露出“那么现在你还有什么话可说？”的神态，只听得法师宣告道：","Everybody was full of awe and interest again right away, the incorrigible idiots.They watched the incantations absorbingly, and looked at me with a “There, now, what can you say to that?” air, when the announcement came:"
"“国王因狩猎龙体困倦，正在宫中安睡，酣然无梦，已经两个小时了。”","“The king is weary with the chase, and lieth in his palace these two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep.”"
"“愿上帝赐福于他！”修道院院长喊道，还划着十字，“愿这睡眠能让陛下身心舒展，龙体大安。”","“God’s benison upon him!” said the abbot, and crossed himself; “may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul.”"
"“他要真是在睡觉的话，也许能吧，”　我说道，“不过国王可没在睡觉，他在骑马呢。”","“And so it might be, if he were sleeping,” I said, “but the king is not sleeping, the king rides.”"
"这下麻烦又来了——两个权威起了冲突。谁也不知道该信哪一个，我还没有完全名声扫地。那个魔法师起了藐视之心，说道：","Here was trouble again—a conflict of authority.Nobody knew which of us to believe; I still had some reputation left.The magician’s scorn was stirred, and he said:"
"“瞧，神通广大的占卜师、预言家和魔法师本人生平见过不少了，但是还没有一个能悠哉悠哉地坐着不动，不靠念咒相助就能看穿一切的。”","“Lo, I have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and magicians in my life days, but none before that could sit idle and see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help.”"
"“你一直呆在山林里，吃了大亏了。　我自己也用咒语来着，这班好弟兄都知道——不过只在特定的时刻。”","“You have lived in the woods, and lost much by it.　I use incantations myself, as this good brotherhood are aware—but only on occasions of moment.”"
"要论冷嘲热讽，我觉得还能跟人拼一拼。　那一番话刺得这家伙很是不自在。院长紧跟着又打听王后和众大臣的消息，得到这样的答复：","When it comes to sarcasming, I reckon I know how to keep my end up. 　That jab made this fellow squirm.The abbot inquired after the queen and the court, and got this information:"
"“和国王一样，他们都累倒了，正在睡觉呢。”","“They be all on sleep, being overcome by fatigue, like as to the king.”"
"我说道：","I said:"
"“这纯粹又是胡扯。　他们当中有半数在找乐子，王后和其余那些人也不是在睡觉，而是在骑马。现在也许你能展开点本领，告诉我们国王和王后以及随从众人此时正骑着马往哪儿走呢？”","“That is merely another lie.　Half of them are about their amusements, the queen and the other half are not sleeping, they ride.Now perhaps you can spread yourself a little, and tell us where the king and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going?”"
"“我刚才说过，他们此时正在睡觉；不过明日他们就会骑马出行，赶往海边。”","“They sleep now, as I said; but on the morrow they will ride, for they go a journey toward the sea.”"
"“那后天晚祷的时候他们会到哪里呢？”","“And where will they be the day after to-morrow at vespers?”"
"“远至卡米洛之北，行程过半。”","“Far to the north of Camelot, and half their journey will be done.”"
"“这又是胡扯，跟事实相差一百五十英里。他们不是行程过半，而是全都走完了，而且他们会来到这里，来到这个山谷。”","“That is another lie, by the space of a hundred and fifty miles.Their journey will not be merely half done, it will be all done, and they will be HERE, in this valley.”"
"这炮打得漂亮！这下把院长和众修道士搅得激动万分，而那位大法师则被震得连站都站不稳了。我紧跟着又来一句：","THAT was a noble shot!It set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement, and it rocked the enchanter to his base.I followed the thing right up:"
"“要是国王不来，我甘受骑棍之刑；要是他来了，我就要你骑在棍子上。”","“If the king does not arrive, I will have myself ridden on a rail: if he does I will ride you on a rail instead.”"
"第二天我去了电话局，发现国王一路赶来，已经过了两个城镇了。第三天我用同样的方法探明了国王的行程。　这些事情我谁也没告诉。第三天的那些报告显示，如果他保持这个速度，下午四点就会到了。这里仍然没有任何迹象表明有人对他的到来感兴趣；好像没人去做接驾的准备，说真的，这可有点奇怪。只有一个解释：那就是另一位魔法师抢了我的生意，准没错。事实果真如此。关于这事我问了我的一位修道士朋友，他说，没错，那位魔法师又额外施魔法，发现朝廷已经决定哪里也不去了，就呆在宫里。你瞧瞧！瞧瞧在这个国家名声到底值多少钱吧。这帮人早已亲眼目睹我施展了有史以来最为漂亮的魔法，而且是他们记忆中唯一真正有价值的一套，可是你瞧他们现在这个样子，只不过碰上了个光会空口说大话，却拿不出任何证据来证明自己法力的冒险家，就奉若神明了。","Next day I went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line.I spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way.　I kept these matters to myself.The third day’s reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon.There was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming; there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state; a strange thing, truly.Only one thing could explain this: that other magician had been cutting under me, sure.This was true.I asked a friend of mine, a monk, about it, and he said, yes, the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all, but stay at home.Think of that!Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country.These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in history, and the only one within their memory that had a positive value, and yet here they were, ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word."
"不过，让国王就这么驾到，一点声势也不造，这可不是什么好权术，因此我就走下山岗，招来了一队朝圣者，还用烟将一群隐士从洞里熏了出来，叫他们在两点钟的时候动身去迎接圣驾。国王到来的时候就是这么个状态。我把修道院院长带到露台上，请他看看，一国之君就要到来，却没有一个修道士到场欢迎，连点响动都没有，更没有喜庆的钟声来让龙颜大悦，院长一见之下火冒三丈，颜面顿失，显得很无助。他只看了一眼就飞奔而去，去召集他的大队人马。只隔了一分钟就响起了激荡的钟声，修道士和修女们从各种房屋里冒了出来，一窝蜂地冲向迎面而来的队伍；跟着冲出来的还有那位魔法师——而且是骑着木棍儿去的，这是院长下的命令；这下他算是名声扫地了，而我的名声却又上了天。不错，一个人在这样的国家倒是可以保住自己的牌子，可是要坐着不动就难保了，他必须随时做好准备，时时刻刻都要关注他的生意才行。","However, it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all, so I went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two o’clock to meet him.And that was the sort of state he arrived in.The abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when I brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome, and no stir of life or clang of joy-bell to glad his spirit.He took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces.The next minute the bells were dinning furiously, and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns, who went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession; and with them went that magician—and he was on a rail, too, by the abbot’s order; and his reputation was in the mud, and mine was in the sky again.Yes, a man can keep his trademark current in such a country, but he can’t sit around and do it; he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along."
"第二十五章　竞争考核","CHAPTER 25 A Competitive Examination"
"每当国王想换换空气，或者要摆驾出行，或者驾临一位远方贵族之家，想让他为了接驾而倾家荡产，都会有那么一些官员跟随左右。　这是当时的风尚。因此军官招考委员会的各位委员也随国王一起来到了山谷，虽然他们在家里一样可以处理公务。尽管国王这次远行严格说来只能算是假日出游，他还是照样在某些方面继续办公。和往常一样，他用手摸的方法给人治病；太阳升起时他在大门口支起法庭审案，因为他本人就是英国高等法院的大法官。","WHEN the king traveled for change of air, or made a progress, or visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep, part of the administration moved with him. 　It was a fashion of the time.The Commission charged with the examination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the Valley, whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home.And although this expedition was strictly a holiday excursion for the king, he kept some of his business functions going just the same.He touched for the evil, as usual; he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases, for he was himself Chief Justice of the King’s Bench."
"他在这个职位上干得还不错。作为法官，他很英明，也很有人情味，而且很显然他是想竭尽全力，秉公执法——按照他自己的标准。这就有很大的局限性了。他的标准——我指的是他所受的培养教育——往往会使他在做决断时带有偏见。只要贵族或者绅士跟地位低的人起了纷争，无论他自己觉没觉察到，国王都会偏向前者，同情前者。　事情绝不可能是另外的样子。天底下的人都知道并且都承认，奴隶制使奴隶主感觉麻木，是非不分；而所谓的特权阶层，所谓的贵族，只不过是一群奴隶主，不过换了个名字而已。这话听起来有点刺耳，可是任谁听了都不会生气——即使是贵族本人——除非事实本身令人生气：因为这话不过是阐明了一个事实而已。奴隶制让人反感之处在于事实本身，而不是它的名字。你只要一听就能听出来，贵族说起身份比自己低的人时——虽然稍稍加了点掩饰——那神气，那口吻，和真正的奴隶主别无二致。在这神气和口吻背后，正体现了奴隶主的精神和其麻木不仁的感情。贵族也好，奴隶主也罢，都同出一源：长久以来有种根深蒂固的习俗，占有者总认为自己高人一等。国王断案经常不公正，不过这也只能怪他受到的熏陶，怪他那与生俱来而且无法改变的同情心。让他断案是非常不适合的，这就好比在饥荒之年随便找个妈妈来将牛奶分给饥饿的孩子们，她自己的孩子自然要比其他孩子多沾点光了。","He shone very well in this latter office.He was a wise and humane judge, and he clearly did his honest best and fairest,—according to his lights.That is a large reservation.His lights—I mean his rearing—often colored his decisions.Whenever there was a dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree, the king’s leanings and sympathies were for the former class always, whether he suspected it or not.It was impossible that this should be otherwise.The blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholder’s moral perceptions are known and conceded, the world over; and a privileged class, an aristocracy, is but a band of slaveholders under another name.This has a harsh sound, and yet should not be offensive to any—even to the noble himself—unless the fact itself be an offense: for the statement simply formulates a fact.The repulsive feature of slavery is the THING, not its name.One needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognize—and in but indifferently modified measure—the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder; and behind these are the slaveholder’s spirit, the slaveholder’s blunted feeling.They are the result of the same cause in both cases: the possessor’s old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being.The king’s judgments wrought frequent injustices, but it was merely the fault of his training, his natural and unalterable sympathies.He was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother for the position of milk-distributor to starving children in famine-time; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest."
"有一桩离奇的官司打到了国王这儿来。有一位年轻的姑娘，无父无母，有一笔丰厚的财产，嫁给了一个身无分文的穷帅小伙。这位姑娘的产业在教会所管辖的一片领地范围之内。这个教区的主教出身名门贵族，傲慢自大，要霸占那姑娘的产业，找了个借口，说那姑娘不该私自结婚，欺瞒教会，侵犯了教会作为这片领地领主的权利——就是前文提到过的“领主权”。拒绝或规避领主权，就要受到没收财产的惩罚。那位姑娘辩护说，这块领地的领主权归主教所有，而此案所涉及的这项特权是不可转让的，只能由主教本人来行使，要么就只能闲置；同时，还有一条更古老的法律，是教会自己制定的，严令禁止主教行使这项权利。　这案子可真够古怪的。","One very curious case came before the king.A young girl, an orphan, who had a considerable estate, married a fine young fellow who had nothing.The girl’s property was within a seigniory held by the Church.The bishop of the diocese, an arrogant scion of the great nobility, claimed the girl’s estate on the ground that she had married privately, and thus had cheated the Church out of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory—the one heretofore referred to as le droit du seigneur.The penalty of refusal or avoidance was confiscation.The girl’s defense was, that the lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop, and the particular right here involved was not transferable, but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated; and that an older law, of the Church itself, strictly barred the bishop from exercising it.　It was a very odd case, indeed."
"这让我回想起年轻时从书上看到过伦敦市议员如何奇思妙想筹集钱款来建造市长官邸的事情。如果没有按照英国国教仪式宣过誓，谁也没有资格成为伦敦行政司法长官的候选人。　因此，那些非国教人士就都不合格，请他们竞选他们也没有资格，选上了也当不成。那些市议员，毫无疑问，都是美国人假扮的，灵光一闪想出来这样一个好主意：他们通过了一条地方法案，规定无论谁拒绝当行政司法官的候选人，都要处以400镑的罚款，而如果当选了却不肯上任，则处以600镑的罚款。接着他们又开始行动，前前后后选举出许多非国教人士，直到罚款达到15000镑才作罢。直到今天，那座富丽堂皇的市长官邸还屹立在那里，让市民面红耳赤，想起在那久已逝去、令人缅怀的岁月里，有那么一群美国人潜入伦敦，玩起阴谋诡计，他们曾借着这样的诡计在世界上所有真正善良圣洁的民族中落了个独一无二的不清不白的名声。　","It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money that built the Mansion House.A person who had not taken the Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of London.Thus Dissenters were ineligible; they could not run if asked, they could not serve if elected.The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise, hit upon this neat device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine of L400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff, and a fine of L600 upon any person who, after being elected sheriff, refused to serve.Then they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and kept it up until they had collected L15,000 in fines; and there stands the stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth."
"照我看来，那位姑娘似乎很有理，那位主教也一样有理。　我看不出国王该怎样摆脱这个困境。可是他竟然摆脱了。以下就是他的判决：","The girl’s case seemed strong to me; the bishop’s case was just as strong.I did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole.But he got out.I append his decision:"
"此案依朕看来实在不难了断，易如儿戏。若这位年轻新娘早早通知封地领主，即作为合法主人和保护者的主教，此乃本分，她定不会蒙受丝毫损失，因为这位主教可以获得特许，临时大开方便之门，使他有权行使上述之权力，由此这位女子也将保住所有家产。　然而，这位女子既然没有履行第一项职责，便无法履行所有职责；无论是谁抓住绳子，只要割断了双手上方的绳索，必定会跌落下来；再为自己辩护，说其余的绳子完好无损，也无济于事，他会发现自己断不可能幸免于祸。唔，这位女子的案子从一开始就输定了。本庭判决，她所有财产悉数没收，归上述主教所有，分文不留，并罚其支付所有诉讼费用。下一个！”","“Truly I find small difficulty here, the matter being even a child’s affair for simpleness.An the young bride had conveyed notice, as in duty bound, to her feudal lord and proper master and protector the bishop, she had suffered no loss, for the said bishop could have got a dispensation making him, for temporary conveniency, eligible to the exercise of his said right, and thus would she have kept all she had.Whereas, failing in her first duty, she hath by that failure failed in all; for whoso, clinging to a rope, severeth it above his hands, must fall; it being no defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound, neither any deliverance from his peril, as he shall find.Pardy, the woman’s case is rotten at the source.It is the decree of the court that she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods, even to the last farthing that she doth possess, and be thereto mulcted in the costs.Next!”"
"新婚燕尔，甜蜜的时光还没过三个月，就落得个如此悲惨的下场。　可怜的小两口！三个月来他们尝到了人间的欢乐。他们的穿戴极尽华美，能做到这样可要绞尽脑汁来规避禁奢令对于他们这样地位的人的约束。穿着如此精美的衣服，女的趴在男的肩头哭哭啼啼，而男的安慰着她，嘴里说着满怀希望的话语，却带着绝望的腔调，两人一起走出了公堂，走进那天地之间，没有房子住，没有床睡，没有饭吃。哼，就是路边的叫花子也比他们富有呢。","Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old.　Poor young creatures!They had lived these three months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts.These clothes and trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree; and in these pretty clothes, she crying on his shoulder, and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair, they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless, bedless, breadless; why, the very beggars by the roadsides were not so poor as they."
"嗨，国王反正是摆脱了困境；毫无疑问，他用的是让教会和其他贵族都满意的方式。人们常常写些溢美之辞花言巧语来为君主制辩护，而事实还是如此，如果国家每个人都有选举权的话，残暴的法律根本不可能产生。要建立一个共和国，亚瑟王庭的人民根本就不是那块料，因为他们被君主制践踏得太久了。可是即使是他们，如果是在全体自由的投票方式下，即使再傻他们也会马上废止国王刚才执行的那条法律的。有一句话，由于大家常挂在嘴边，仿佛都有了意义——说出来仿佛就有了言外之意，这就是说，当提起这个或那个民族可能有“自治能力”的时候，言外之意就是说，不定在哪个地方，哪个朝代，还有那么一个民族缺乏这种能力——这个民族无法实行自治，不如某些自封的专家管理得好，或者可能管理得好。古往今来，无论哪个民族的谋略之士都大量来自于人民大众，而且只能来自人民大众——而不是来自于特权阶级；因此，无论这个民族的智力水平如何，无论是高是低，它的大部分能力都蕴藏于无数默默无闻的贫苦民众之间，所以，民族自治所需的人才永远都是取之不竭的。这就申明了一件总是不证自明的事实：只要是君主制，即使治理得最好，最自由，最开明，也仍比不上民族自治所能达到的最佳状态；至于那些次等的君主政体，直至最差的，都是如此。","Well, the king was out of the hole; and on terms satisfactory to the Church and the rest of the aristocracy, no doubt.Men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy, but the fact remains that where every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.Arthur’s people were of course poor material for a republic, because they had been debased so long by monarchy; and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote.There is a phrase which has grown so common in the world’s mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaning—the sense and meaning implied when it is used; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being “capable of selfgovernment”; and the implied sense of it is, that there has been a nation somewhere, some time or other which WASN’T capable of it—wasn’t as able to govern itself as some self-appointed specialists were or would be to govern it.The master minds of all nations, in all ages, have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation, and from the mass of the nation only—not from its privileged classes; and so, no matter what the nation’s intellectual grade was; whether high or low, the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor, and so it never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself.Which is to assert an always self-proven fact: that even the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition attainable by its people; and that the same is true of kindred governments of lower grades, all the way down to the lowest."
"亚瑟王加快了招募军队的速度，实在出乎我的意料。我没想到他会在我外出时就着手此事，因此我还没来得及制订出选定军官的标准。我只不过提了一下，说最好对每一个候选人都进行严格仔细的考查。而且私下里我还打算整理出一套招考的军事资格，除了我的军校学生，谁也达不到。我出发之前本该把这件事办妥的，因为国王对于常备军这个主意太痴迷了，所以等不及了，要马上就着手干，而且还发明出一套招考方案来，就他那脑筋而言已经不错了。","King Arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations.I had not supposed he would move in the matter while I was away; and so I had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers; I had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination; and privately I meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my West Pointers.That ought to have been attended to before I left; for the king was so taken with the idea of a standing army that he couldn’t wait but must get about it at once, and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could invent out of his own head."
"我急切地想知道这个方案的内容；而且，我还急于炫耀一番，向考官们展示，我那个方案要更出色。　我委婉地向国王暗示了一下，他的好奇心一下子就被勾了起来。 　当考官们都到齐了之后，我也随着国王进去，身后跟着那些候考的人。　其中有一个来投考的人是我的军校学生，英俊年少，跟着他的还有我手下的两个军校教授。　","I was impatient to see what this was; and to show, too, how much more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining Board.I intimated this, gently, to the king, and it fired his curiosity.  When the Board was assembled, I followed him in; and behind us came the candidates.One of these candidates was a bright young West Pointer of mine, and with him were a couple of my West Point professors."
"一见到那些考官，我真是哭笑不得。担任主考官的官员就是后世称之为“纹章院”的纹章官！其余两位都是他那个部门的局长，自然，这三位都是神职人员。所有能读书写字的官员都是神职人员。　","When I saw the Board, I did not know whether to cry or to laugh.The head of it was the officer known to later centuries as Norroy King-at-Arms!The two other members were chiefs of bureaus in his department; and all three were priests, of course; all officials who had to know how to read and write were priests."
"为了对我表示敬意，他们头一个把我的学生喊了进来，主考官一本正经地开始问起话来：","My candidate was called first, out of courtesy to me, and the head of the Board opened on him with official solemnity:"
"“姓名？”","“Name?”"
"“莫里斯。”","“Mal-ease.”"
"“父姓？”","“Son of?”"
"“韦伯斯特。”","“Webster.”"
"“韦伯斯特——韦伯斯特。唔——我——我记不得有这么个姓了。出身？”","“Webster—Webster.H’m—I—my memory faileth to recall the name.Condition?”"
"“织工。”","“Weaver.”"
"“织工！上帝保佑！”","“Weaver!God keep us!”"
"国王从头到脚，彻底震惊了，有一个书记员晕倒了，其余几位也差不多少。 主考官定了定神，气冲冲地说道：","The king was staggered, from his summit to his foundations; one clerk fainted, and the others came near it.  The chairman pulled himself together, and said indignantly:"
"“够了。给我下去吧。”","“It is sufficient.Get you hence.”"
"但是我去恳求国王。　我请求让我的考生有机会考试。　国王倒是乐意，可是那些出身高贵的考官们苦苦哀求国王，别让他们受这种侮辱，去考核织工之子。 我知道他们本来就懂得不多，反正也考不了他，所以我帮着他们一起恳求，国王就把这项任务交给了我的教授了。　我早就准备了一块黑板，现在把它挂上，好戏就开始了。　那小伙子讲起军事学来如数家珍，真是娓娓动听，什么进攻与围攻啦，什么供给与运输啦，什么布雷与扫雷啦，什么重大战略、大战略与小战略啦，信号、步兵、骑兵、炮兵，还有什么攻城炮、野战炮、加特林机关枪、来复枪、滑膛枪、滑膛枪演习、左轮手枪演习，说得头头是道——可是这些鲶鱼般的家伙们是彻头彻尾一个字都听不懂，你明白的——看那小伙子拿粉笔在黑板上演算那些可怕的数学公式，多赏心悦目呀，那是连天使都会被难住的公式，可他写起来易如反掌——都是些关于日食月食、彗星、冬至夏至、星座、平均太阳时、恒星时、吃饭时、睡觉时诸如此类以及其他一切凡是你能想到的，不管天上地下的，只要能折磨敌人，吓唬敌人，让敌人后悔来这儿就行——那小伙子最终行了个军礼，站到了一旁，此时我真是太得意了，恨不得搂住他，而其他人都茫然了，一半是惶恐不已，一半是如痴如醉，全都陷入其中，被唬住了。　我料定这块蛋糕就是我们的了，而且是以多数票获胜。","But I appealed to the king.I begged that my candidate might be examined.The king was willing, but the Board, who were all well-born folk, implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weaver’s son. I knew they didn’t know enough to examine him anyway, so I joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors.I had had a blackboard prepared, and it was put up now, and the circus began.It was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war, and wallow in details of battle and siege, of supply, transportation, mining and countermining, grand tactics, big strategy and little strategy, signal service, infantry, cavalry, artillery, and all about siege guns, field guns, gatling guns, rifled guns, smooth bores, musket practice, revolver practice—and not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of, you understand—and it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the blackboard that would stump the angels themselves, and do it like nothing, too—all about eclipses, and comets, and solstices, and constellations, and mean time, and sidereal time, and dinner time, and bedtime, and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make him wish he hadn’t come—and when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last, I was proud enough to hug him, and all those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified, partly drunk, and wholly caught out and snowed under. I judged that the cake was ours, and by a large majority.I judged that the cake was ours, and by a large majority."
"教育的力量可真伟大。这就是那个小伙子，刚到军校时还愚昧无知，当我问他：“在战场上如果一个将领的马中弹倒地了，该怎么办？”他很天真地回答道：","Education is a great thing.This was the same youth who had come to West Point so ignorant that when I asked him, “If a general officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle, what ought he to do?” answered up naively and said:"
"“爬起来，拍打拍打身上。”","“Get up and brush himself.”"
"这时叫进来一位年轻的贵族。我觉得该亲自问他几句。我说：","One of the young nobles was called up now.I thought I would question him a little myself.I said:"
"“阁下念过书吗？”","“Can your lordship read?”"
"他气得满脸通红，朝我发火道：","His face flushed indignantly, and he fired this at me:"
"“你以为我是小职员吗？以我的血统，怎么能——”","“Takest me for a clerk?I trow I am not of a blood that—”"
"“请回答问题！”","“Answer the question!”"
"他强压怒火，勉强挤出一句“没有。”","He crowded his wrath down and made out to answer “No.”"
"“那你会写字吗？”","“Can you write?”"
"他一听又要发火，可是我说：","He wanted to resent this, too, but I said:"
"“你只需回答问题，不要牵三扯四。你来这里不是来卖弄血统或家世的，不准提及此类话题。你会写字吗？”","“You will confine yourself to the questions, and make no comments.You are not here to air your blood or your graces, and nothing of the sort will be permitted.Can you write?”"
"“不会。”","“No.”"
"“你懂不懂九九乘法表？”","“Do you know the multiplication table?”"
"“不知大人所言何物。”","“I wit not what ye refer to.”"
"“9乘以6得多少？”","“How much is 9 times 6?”"
"“对本人而言，此乃不解之谜，皆因本人有生以来，从未遇到如此紧急之事需要解此奥秘的，既然无需知道此物，无怪本人一无所知。”","“It is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life-days occurred, and so, not having no need to know this thing, I abide barren of the knowledge.”"
"“甲拿价值两便士一蒲式耳的洋葱一桶，跟乙去换价值四便士的羊一只和价值一便士的狗一只，可是狗还没到甲手里就被丙给杀了，因为狗把丙错认成丁给咬了，那么，乙欠甲多少钱，哪方该赔狗钱，丙还是丁，赔的狗钱该给谁？如果给甲，一便士够吗？甲该不该索要额外的钱来补偿由此带来的损失呢？因为狗还可能为他带来收益，这笔收益可以算作所得增值，也就是收益权。”","“If A trade a barrel of onions to B, worth 2 pence the bushel, in exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a penny, and C kill the dog before delivery, because bitten by the same, who mistook him for D, what sum is still due to A from B, and which party pays for the dog, C or D, and who gets the money?If A, is the penny sufficient, or may he claim consequential damages in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit which might have inured from the dog, and classifiable as earned increment, that is to say, usufruct?”"
"“千真万确，我主神通广大，神机妙算，天道莫测，本人从未遇到这种问题，问得人心神俱乱，思绪如麻。因此，虽然我不能出手帮忙，还是恳请大人放过那些狗和洋葱，还有那些名字稀奇古怪的人吧，让他们自己拯救自己，度过那可怜而又蹊跷的难关，我若出手相助，只能越帮越忙，恐怕还没见到他们的悲惨命运就自己先丢了性命。”","“Verily, in the all-wise and unknowable providence of God, who moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform, have I never heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and congestion of the ducts of thought.Wherefore I beseech you let the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless names work out their several salvations from their piteous and wonderful difficulties without help of mine, for indeed their trouble is sufficient as it is, whereas an I tried to help I should but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself to see the desolation wrought.”"

"主考官继续进行考试，说道：","The chairman resumed as follows:"
"“请问你祖上对于君主和国家有何战功，使得他能够跻身显贵，光宗耀祖？","“By what illustrious achievement for the honor of the Throne and State did the founder of your great line lift himself to the sacred dignity of the British nobility?”"
"“他建造了一家啤酒厂。”","“He built a brewery.”"
"“大人，愚等考官认为此考生完全符合军中将领的要求和条件，待到其竞争对手考核完毕，即可裁定录取。”","“Sire, the Board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements and qualifications for military command, and doth hold his case open for decision after due examination of his competitor.”"
"而那位竞争对手走上前来，亲身证明自己也恰是四代贵族的后代。于是到此时为止，在军官资格上两人打成了平手。","The competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations of nobility himself.So there was a tie in military qualifications that far."
"他站到一旁等着，泼提普尔爵士继续接受询问：","He stood aside a moment, and Sir Pertipole was questioned further:"
"“您家始祖所娶之妻如何？”","“Of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line?”"
"“是头等乡绅之女，可惜并非贵族，她仁慈宽厚，纯洁无瑕，慈悲为怀，德行无可指摘，便是那天下第一名媛淑女，也无出左右。”","“She came of the highest landed gentry, yet she was not noble; she was gracious and pure and charitable, of a blameless life and character, insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the best lady in the land.”"
"“足矣。退下吧。”　　他又把刚才那个竞争的小少爷喊了过来，问道：　“你那光耀门庭的高曾祖母是何等身份，何等出身啊？”","“That will do. Stand down.”　He called up the competing lordling again, and asked: 　“What was the rank and condition of the great-grandmother who conferred British nobility upon your great house?”"
"“她曾是一位国王的情妇，出身低微，全靠自身美德才爬上高位，荣被圣泽。”","“She was a king’s leman and did climb to that splendid eminence by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born.”"
"“啊，这才是货真价实的名门贵族，这才是珠联璧合。尊敬的大人，中尉一职是您的了。承蒙不弃，还望笑纳。此等职位虽然卑微，却能助您步步高升，断不会辱没祖上声名。”","“Ah, this, indeed, is true nobility, this is the right and perfect intermixture.The lieutenancy is yours, fair lord.Hold it not in contempt; it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine.”"
"我真是颜面扫地，仿佛跌落到万丈深渊。我还自以为轻而易举就能取得顶天的胜利，可却落得个如此下场！","I was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation.I had promised myself an easy and zenith-scouring triumph, and this was the outcome!"
"那可怜的学员一脸的失望，我几乎都没脸看他了。我告诉他回家耐心等待，这事儿还没完呢。","I was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the face.I told him to go home and be patient, this wasn’t the end."
"我私下觐见了国王，给他出了个主意。　我说任命贵族当军团的军官，真是太正确了，再英明不过了。不过再增加五百个军官，这主意也不错；实际上，只要国家有多少贵族和贵族亲戚，就增加多少军官哪怕最终军官的数量比士兵多五倍呢；由此一来，就可以组成一流的兵团，让人眼热的兵团，属于国王自己的兵团，打起仗来，自成一路，想打到哪儿就打到哪儿，想怎么打就怎么打，强大无比，不受人制约。这样一来，所有的贵族都会一心加入这个兵团，并且个个心满意足，欢天喜地。随后，我们可以用普通人来组建其余的常备军，任用没有头衔的普通人来当军官，这正合适——选派那些普通人的标准就是任人唯贤——而且我们还得叫这个兵团完全听从指挥，不能像那班贵族那样无拘无束；并且我们还要强迫他们不停努力干活儿，不得松懈，为的是一旦国王专属的军团累了，想出去换换空气，搜妖寻魔游荡一番，消遣消遣，就可以放心出发了，因为他们明白身后有放心的人手来接管，事情还会像以往一样继续进行。　国王对这个点子很是着迷。　","I had a private audience with the king, and made a proposition.I said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities, and he couldn’t have done a wiser thing.It would also be a good idea to add five hundred officers to it; in fact, add as many officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the country, even if there should finally be five times as many officers as privates in it; and thus make it the crack regiment, the envied regiment, the King’s Own regiment, and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way, and go whither it would and come when it pleased, in time of war, and be utterly swell and independent.This would make that regiment the heart’s desire of all the nobility, and they would all be satisfied and happy.Then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace materials, and officer it with nobodies, as was proper—nobodies selected on a basis of mere efficiency—and we would make this regiment toe the line, allow it no aristocratic freedom from restraint, and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering, to the end that whenever the King’s Own was tired and wanted to go off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good time, it could go without uneasiness, knowing that matters were in safe hands behind it, and business going to be continued at the old stand, same as usual.The king was charmed with the idea."
"我注意到了这点，这对我可是颇有价值。我觉得可算是找到解决老大难问题的方法了。你瞧，“龙首”王室这支血脉可谓是多子多孙，绵延不绝。每当这一族又添一丁——这事常常发生——举国上下嘴里都欢欣不已，心中却是万分悲痛。那份欢喜很值得商榷，悲痛却是货真价实的。因为这样一来又要征收一份王室补助金了。这些王室成员多得难以计数，对于国家财政是持续增长的沉重负担，对于王位也是一种威胁。然而亚瑟王怎么也不肯相信后一点，我曾提出各种各样的计划来找东西代替王室补助金，可他一条也听不进去。　我要是能劝说他自掏腰包时不时补助一下这些远族宗亲，那倒能让我大张旗鼓宣扬一下，也能在全国带来好的影响；可是他不干，他连听都不要听。他对王室补助金有着宗教般的狂热；他似乎把这笔钱当成了神圣不可侵犯的东西，谁要想惹火他，没有比攻击那个不堪一击的制度见效更快的了。要是我壮着胆子拐弯抹角地向他暗示，说整个英国没有其他任何一个体面的家族愿意放下身架拿着帽子去化缘——可是，我每次最多只能说到这里；他总是刚到这儿就把我打断，而且不容分说。","When I noticed that, it gave me a valuable notion.I thought I saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last.You see, the royalties of the Pendragon stock were a long-lived race and very fruitful.Whenever a child was born to any of these—and it was pretty often—there was wild joy in the nation’s mouth, and piteous sorrow in the nation’s heart.The joy was questionable, but the grief was honest.Because the event meant another call for a Royal Grant.Long was the list of these royalties, and they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown.Yet Arthur could not believe this latter fact, and he would not listen to any of my various projects for substituting something in the place of the royal grants.If I could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for one of these outlying scions from his own pocket, I could have made a grand to-do over it, and it would have had a good effect with the nation; but no, he wouldn’t hear of such a thing.He had something like a religious passion for royal grant; he seemed to look upon it as a sort of sacred swag, and one could not irritate him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution.If I ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable family in England that would humble itself to hold out the hat—however, that is as far as I ever got; he always cut me short there, and peremptorily, too."
"但我相信机会终于到来了。我可以只招募军官来组建这个一流的军团——一个士兵也不要。军队的一半由贵族组成，少将及其以下的官职都由他们来担任，不过没有报酬，得自己承担自己的费用；只要他们知道军团剩下的那半人都是王室子孙的话，他们肯定不会不乐意的。这些王室子孙担任的官职从中将到陆军元帅不等，由国家发放丰厚的俸禄，配以精良的装备，供给精美的伙食。而且——这才是杀手锏呢——还应该颁布法令，称呼这些王公显贵们时都要冠以大得吓人的华丽丽的头衔（这些头衔我马上就能发明出来），并且全英国只有他们才能被这样称呼。最后，所有的王室子孙都可以自由选择，是加入那个兵团，获得那个伟大的头衔，同时声明放弃王室补助金呢，还是不加入兵团，继续享受这笔补助金。更妙的一招是：那些将要出生还未出生的王室子孙可以生在兵团里，来个开门红，一下子就拿高薪，占据高位，只需要父母预先通知一下。","But I believed I saw my chance at last.I would form this crack regiment out of officers alone—not a single private.Half of it should consist of nobles, who should fill all the places up to Major-General, and serve gratis and pay their own expenses; and they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood.These princes of the blood should range in rank from Lieutenant-General up to Field Marshal, and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and fed by the state.Moreover—and this was the master stroke—it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe-compelling title (which I would presently invent), and they and they only in all England should be so addressed.Finally, all princes of the blood should have free choice; join that regiment, get that great title, and renounce the royal grant, or stay out and receive a grant.Neatest touch of all: unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be BORN into the regiment, and start fair, with good wages and a permanent situation, upon due notice from the parents."
"每个孩子都会加入的，这个我敢打保票；因此，所有现行的补助金都会被放弃；那些新出生的呢，我敢同样保证，都会来加入的。不出六十天，这项稀奇古怪，有悖常规的东西，王室补助金，就不再是活生生的存在了，而会加入到老古董的队伍中去了。","All the boys would join, I was sure of that; so, all existing grants would be relinquished; that the newly born would always join was equally certain.Within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly, the Royal Grant, would cease to be a living fact, and take its place among the curiosities of the past."
"第二十六章　第一份报纸","CHAPTER 26 The First Newspaper"
"我告诉国王我要装扮成一个小自由民四处逛逛，熟悉一下百姓的卑微生活。国王一听，觉得这个主意很新奇，兴致一下子就上来了，定要抓住这个机会亲自去冒险——什么也拦不住他——他要撇下一切跟我走——多少天来他还是头一次碰到这么妙的主意呢。　他想偷偷从后门溜出去立刻就上路，可是我告诉他这可行不通。你瞧，海报都贴出来了，他要治瘰疬——我的意思是他要摸一摸患者来治病——让大家失望就不好了，而且再另改时间也不值得，毕竟只要一个晚上就足够了。而且我认为他要走怎么也该跟王后打声招呼。他一听这话顿时阴下脸来，满面悲伤。　我真后悔跟他提这话，尤其是他还悲悲戚戚地说：","WHEN I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life of the people, he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute, and was bound to take a chance in the adventure himself—nothing should stop him—he would drop everything and go along—it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many a day. 　He wanted to glide out the back way and start at once; but I showed him that that wouldn’t answer.You see, he was billed for the king’s-evil—to touch for it, I mean—and it wouldn’t be right to disappoint the house and it wouldn’t make a delay worth considering, anyway, it was only a one-night stand.And I thought he ought to tell the queen he was going away.He clouded up at that and looked sad. 　I was sorry I had spoken, especially when he said mournfully:"
"“你忘了兰斯洛特在这儿，只要兰斯洛特在，王后才不会理会本王几时出门，几时归来呢。”","“Thou forgettest that Launcelot is here; and where Launcelot is, she noteth not the going forth of the king, nor what day he returneth.”"
"当然，我马上就转移了话题。不错，管妮薇是很美丽，一点不假，可是总体看来她还真够差劲。我从不插手这些事，也不关我的事，可是我就是看不惯，就是要这么说。好几次了，王后都问我“头子大人见到兰斯洛特不曾？”就算她曾有过这样的时刻，心急火燎四处打听国王的下落，我也没赶上。","Of course, I changed the Subject.Yes, Guenever was beautiful, it is true, but take her all around she was pretty slack.I never meddled in these matters, they weren’t my affair, but I did hate to see the way things were going on, and I don’t mind saying that much.Many’s the time she had asked me, “Sir Boss, hast seen Sir Launcelot about?” but if ever she went fretting around for the king I didn’t happen to be around at the time."
"这“国王治病”的场面布置得相当不错——非常整齐，真实可信。国王端坐于御盖之下，一大群全副披挂的牧师前簇后拥。穿着最惹眼的衣服，站在最惹眼位置的那个人是玛莱耐尔，他既是隐士也是江湖医生，负责引见病人。从宽敞的大厅一直到门口都密密麻麻挤满了长瘰疬的人，有躺着的，有坐着的，到处灯火通明。这简直就是戏剧般的画面，实际上从哪儿看都像要演舞台剧，尽管这真的不是在演戏。到场的病人有八百人之多。工作进展缓慢，我对此早就没有新鲜感了，因为我以前看过太多这样的仪式了，没一会儿我就感到腻歪了，可出于礼节不得不硬撑到底。医生也到场了，因为成群的病人当中总有些人的病仅是凭空想象出来的，还有许多明知自己很健康，非要跟国王的肉体接触一下，以此为终身的荣耀，另外还有部分人装病是为了得到国王触摸时附带的那枚钱币。在此之前，发的都是非常小巧的一块金币，值三分之一美元左右。想想在当时当地，这笔钱能买多少东西，而只要人在有生之年得个瘰疬病又是多么的寻常，你就会明白，每年国王治瘰疬占用的款项给国家财政造成的负担，相当于那个政府的“河港治理草案”，会把所有的盈余都搜刮一空。所以我暗自决定要治一治国家财政这个瘰疬。从卡米洛动身闯荡前一周，我就把那笔款项的七分之六交给国库，下令把剩下的七分之一涨涨价格，做成五分一枚的镍币，交到瘰疬治疗部的主管秘书手里；你瞧，用一枚镍币来替代一枚金币，让镍币来干金币的活。这样未免有点委屈了镍币，但我觉得它还能忍受。一般说来，我不赞成货币掺水，可是这回我觉得不失公平，因为反正就是个礼物。你想给礼物掺多少水分就掺多少，而且我就常常这么干。这个国家那些古老的金币和银币通常都是些老古董了，年代大都无法考证，不过有些是古罗马时期的，他们的形状都不大好，比满月后一个周的新月圆不了多少。这些硬币是人工打造的，不是铸造的，因为用得太旧了，上面的图案跟燎泡一样难以辨认，别说，看起来还真像燎泡。我断定，一枚轮廓清晰、铮亮的新镍币，一面印有顶呱呱的国王像，一面印有管妮薇的像，还有一句虔诚而又正受欢迎的格言，保准能在治疗瘰疬病的时候跟比它高贵的硬币一样好用，而且那些长瘰疬的病人也会更喜欢它。我确实没有猜错。今天这批人是头一批试用镍币的，用起来真是效果如神。节省的开支也是理财效果显著。你看看这些数字就能明白了：八百个病人，我们治了七百多个。按照以前的标准，政府要花大约二百四十美元，而按照新标准我们花三十五元就能打发了，如此一来一下子就能节省二百美元。为了更好的体会此举带来的巨大效应，请再看看另外这些数字：一个国家政府每年的开支，相当于本国人口每人贡献出三天的平均工资，还要假设每个人都是成年男子。　拿一个人口六千万的国家来说，假设平均工资是一天两美元，每人缴三天的工资，加起来有三亿六千万美元供政府支出。在我那个时代，我自己的国家里，这笔钱都是收关税收来的，公民以为是外国进口商出的钱，这样一想他心里就很舒坦；可是实际上，这笔钱是由美国人民支付的，因为分配均匀，丝毫不差，所以无论是亿万富翁还是计时工家里吃奶的孩子，每年的负担都是一样的——都是每人要付六美元。我估计世上没有比这更公平的了吧。好嘛，苏格兰和爱尔兰都要对亚瑟王进贡，不列颠三岛的人口加起来有差不多快一百万了。一个工匠的平均日工资是三分钱，要是不管饭的话。照这样一算，国家政府的开支就是一年九万美元，或者说一天二百五十美元左右。因此，通过在治瘰疬日用镍币代替金币，我不仅没伤害到任何人，惹谁不满，反而让各方相关人士皆大欢喜，顺带着还把那天的国家开支节省了五分之四——这要是搁美国我那个年代，相当于节省了八十万美元。做这种替换我可是借鉴了一种非常古老的智慧——是我儿时的智慧——因为一个真正的政治家是不会藐视任何智慧的，无论这种智慧的起源是多么低微：孩提时代遇到外来的传教团，我就会用纽扣代替钱捐出去，从而省下硬币。对于那些什么都不懂的野蛮人来说，钮扣和硬币都是一样的，而对于我来说，硬币比钮扣有用。这样皆大欢喜，谁也没吃亏。","There was a very good lay-out for the king’s-evil business—very tidy and creditable.The king sat under a canopy of state; about him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals.Conspicuous, both for location and personal outfit, stood Marinel, a hermit of the quack-doctor species, to introduce the sick.All abroad over the spacious floor, and clear down to the doors, in a thick jumble, lay or sat the scrofulous, under a strong light.It was as good as a tableau; in fact, it had all the look of being gotten up for that, though it wasn’t.There were eight hundred sick people present.The work was slow; it lacked the interest of novelty for me, because I had seen the ceremonies before; the thing soon became tedious, but the proprieties required me to stick it out.The doctor was there for the reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was the matter with them, and many who were consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king, and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with the touch.Up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar.When you consider how much that amount of money would buy, in that age and country, and how usual it was to be scrofulous, when not dead, you would understand that the annual king’s-evil appropriation was just the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus.So I had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the king’s-evil.I covered six sevenths of the appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on my adventures, and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into fivecent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the King’s Evil Department; a nickel to take the place of each gold coin, you see, and do its work for it.It might strain the nickel some, but I judged it could stand it.As a rule, I do not approve of watering stock, but I considered it square enough in this case, for it was just a gift, anyway.Of course, you can water a gift as much as you want to; and I generally do.The old gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin, as a rule, but some of them were Roman; they were ill-shapen, and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; they were hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and looked like them.I judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with a first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever on the other, and a blooming pious motto, would take the tuck out of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous fancy more; and I was right.This batch was the first it was tried on, and it worked to a charm.The saving in expense was a notable economy.You will see that by these figures: We touched a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this would have cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulled through for about $35, thus saving upward of $200 at one swoop.To appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke, consider these other figures: the annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of a contribution of three days‘ average wages of every individual of the population, counting every individual as if he were a man.　If you take a nation of 60,000,000, where average wages are $2 per day, three days’ wages taken from each individual will provide $360,000,000 and pay the government’s expenses.In my day, in my own country, this money was collected from imposts, and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it, and it made him comfortable to think so; whereas, in fact, it was paid by the American people, and was so equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the 100-millionaire and the annual cost to the sucking child of the day-laborer was precisely the same—each paid $6.Nothing could be equaler than that, I reckon.Well, Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur, and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to something less than 1,000,000.A mechanic’s average wage was 3 cents a day, when he paid his own keep.By this rule the national government’s expenses were $90,000 a year, or about $250 a day.Thus, by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king’s-evil day, I not only injured no one, dissatisfied no one, but pleased all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day’s national expense into the bargain—a saving which would have been the equivalent of $800,000 in my day in America.In making this substitution I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source—the wisdom of my boyhood—for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom, howsoever lowly may be its origin: in my boyhood I had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause.The buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin, the coin would answer me better than the buttons; all hands were happy and nobody hurt."
"病人来一个玛莱纳尔就接待一个。他要检验一下候诊人，如果候诊人不符合条件，就斥责他们走开；如果符合条件，就把他移交给国王。一位牧师念道：“手触病人，病即痊愈。”　　随之牧师一边念，国王一边用手摸摸溃疡处。最后，病人算是毕业了，领了镍币——国王亲自给他挂在脖子上——就被打发走了。你认为这能治什么病吗？确实能治。只要病人坚信不疑，什么鬼把戏都能治病。　在阿斯托勒特附近有座教堂，在那儿圣母曾向一个放鹅姑娘显过灵——那姑娘自己那么说的——于是他们就在那个地方建了这座教堂，还挂了一幅圣母显灵的画——那幅画你要看了准会觉得有病之人不宜靠近，太危险。可是恰恰相反，每年都有成千上万的人，瘸的瘸，病的病，来到画前祈祷，离开的时候身轻体健；即使是身体强健的人看了也照样活得好好的。当然，我听说这些事的时候根本就不相信，但是当我去了那里亲眼看到之后我才信服了。我亲眼看到了治疗效果。还真能治病，一点不带掺假的。我在卡米洛看到过几个拄拐多年的瘸子，他们来到这里在画前祈祷，就能扔掉拐棍，离开时一点也不瘸了。那些人临走时把拐棍丢在那儿留作证明，一堆一堆的。","Marinel took the patients as they came.He examined the candidate; if he couldn’t qualify he was warned off; if he could he was passed along to the king.A priest pronounced the words, “They shall lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.” 　Then the king stroked the ulcers, while the reading continued; finally, the patient graduated and got his nickel—the king hanging it around his neck himself—and was dismissed.Would you think that that would cure?It certainly did.Any mummery will cure if the patient’s faith is strong in it.Up by Astolat there was a chapel where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd geese around there—the girl said so herself—and they built the chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the occurrence—a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to approach; whereas, on the contrary, thousands of the lame and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound; and even the well could look upon it and live.Of course, when I was told these things I did not believe them; but when I went there and saw them I had to succumb.I saw the cures effected myself; and they were real cures and not questionable.I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for years on crutches, arrive and pray before that picture, and put down their crutches and walk off without a limp.There were piles of crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony."
"在别的地方治病就靠病人的心理作用，不用对病人说一句话就能治愈。还有些地方，专家把病人们都聚集到一个屋子里，对他们祈祷，借助病人的信仰来治病，那些病人也都痊愈而去。不论在哪儿，要是你发现国王治愈不了瘰疬，你就可以断定那最能支撑王位的迷信——就是子民相信君权神授这件事——已经失灵了。在我年轻的时候，英国的君主们已经不再用触摸来治瘰疬了，可是也不必如此缺乏自信：五十次他们至少可以治好四十九次。","In other places people operated on a patient’s mind, without saying a word to him, and cured him.In others, experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and those patients went away cured.Wherever you find a king who can’t cure the king’s-evil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his throne—the subject’s belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign—has passed away.In my youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil, but there was no occasion for this diffidence: they could have cured it forty-nine times in fifty."
"唉，牧师已经哼哼了三个钟头了，那位好心的国王也不断地擦拭着他圣明的证据，而病人还在跟以前一样不停地向前涌，此时我感觉烦透了。我就坐在离御盖不远的地方，靠着一扇敞开的窗户。这已经是第五百次了，病人往前一站，请国王摸他那令人恶心的地方。那些词语又一次哼哼嗡嗡响了起来：“手触病人”——正在这个当口，外面响起了清脆得像喇叭一样的声音，把我的魂都勾走了，还把那十三个毫无价值的世纪从我耳边赶走了：“卡米洛《欢呼与文艺火山周刊》！——最新发行——只要两分钱——全部是关于圣洁谷大法术的新闻！”　　比国王更伟大的人降临了——那就是报童。可是那一大帮人里除了我，谁也不会明白这个伟大的诞生意味着什么，也不会明白这位威力无比的魔法师来到这个世上到底要做什么。","Well, when the priest had been droning for three hours, and the good king polishing the evidences, and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored.I was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state.For the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his repulsivenesses stroked; again those words were being droned out: “they shall lay their hands on the sick”—when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: “Camelot WEEKLY HOSANNAH AND LITERARY VOLCANO!—latest irruption—only two cents—all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!” 　One greater than kings had arrived—the newsboy.But I was the only person in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth, and what this imperial magician was come into the world to do."
"我向窗外丢了一枚镍币要了一份报纸；这位像亚当一样新鲜的报童跑到街角去给我换零钱找零去了，直到现在还在街角没回来呢。能再次看到报纸心里甭提多美了，不过我的眼睛刚落到报纸第一行用大字排的标题上，我心里就暗暗吃了一惊。很久以来我都生活在粘粘糊糊无法摆脱的氛围里，人人对我都毕恭毕敬，唯唯诺诺，因此这个标题仿佛将一股小小的寒流注入我的体内，我不禁哆嗦了一下：","I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper; the Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change; is around the corner yet.It was delicious to see a newspaper again, yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display head-lines.I had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence, respect, deference, so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave through me:"

"的确，这也太花哨了点。要是在以前我兴许还很欣赏，看不出来有什么不对头的地方，可是现在听起来却这么的刺耳。要是作为阿肯色州的新闻风格这还不错，可惜这里不是阿肯色州。并且，倒数第二行没准会惹恼那些隐士，他们也许不会找我们打广告了。真的，整份报纸从头到尾都油腔滑调，轻飘飘的。很显然我自己不知不觉也发生了巨大的转变。我发现自己讨厌起这种没规没矩不恭不敬的调调来了，要搁以前我还觉得非常得体，说话就要这样带着点俏皮的优雅。下面这种新闻满报纸都是，让我很不舒服：","Yes, it was too loud.Once I could have enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it, but now its note was discordant.It was good Arkansas journalism, but this was not Arkansas.Moreover, the next to the last line was calculated to give offense to the hermits, and perhaps lose us their advertising.Indeed, there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through the paper.It was plain I had undergone a considerable change without noticing it.I found myself unpleasantly affected by pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life.There was an abundance of the following breed of items, and they discomforted me:"

"当然，在刚开始报纸办成这样就算不错了；我很明白这点，不过还是有点让人失望。我更喜欢《宫廷简报》，说真的，在看了那些狎昵放肆的陈词滥调之后，它简单质朴而又中规中矩的笔调明显让我耳目一新。不过，即使这样它仍有需要改进的地方。不管怎么折腾，宫廷简报很难搞出点变化来，这点我承认。它叙述起事实来过于单调平淡，任你再怎么努力给它们平添点生气和激情，也只会把自己难住，败下阵来。最好的处理方法——实际上也是唯一明智的方法——就是运用不同的形式来掩盖内容上的重复：每次都把事实层层剥皮，然后再给它包上一张语言的新皮。它能骗过你的眼睛，你会觉得这是新的事实，它能让你认为皇宫里进行的事情和外面的一样，这就能使你情绪激动，非常有胃口吞下整个专栏，而且可能永远不会发觉这一大桶豆子汤只是由一粒豆子熬出来的。克拉伦斯的法子不错，既简单又体面，直截了当，有条有理；我想说的只是，这不是最佳的方法：","Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning; I knew that quite well, and yet it was somehow disappointing.The “Court Circular” pleased me better; indeed, its simple and dignified respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful familiarities.But even it could have been improved.Do what one may, there is no getting an air of variety into a court circular, I acknowledge that.There is a profound monotonousness about its facts that baffles and defeats one’s sincerest efforts to make them sparkle and enthuse.The best way to manage—in fact, the only sensible way—is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under variety of form: skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle of words.It deceives the eye; you think it is a new fact; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything; this excites you, and you drain the whole column, with a good appetite, and perhaps never notice that it’s a barrel of soup made out of a single bean.Clarence’s way was good, it was simple, it was dignified, it was direct and business-like; all I say is, it was not the best way:"

"不过，从整体来看来，我对这份简报还是非常满意的。时不时还是能看到小小的排版疏漏，不过还不算太多，不至于出什么事，而且就阿肯色州的校对水平而言就够不错的了，比起亚瑟王那个时代那个国家要高不少。总体说来，语法方面有些纰漏，句子结构也有点蹩脚；不过我不大在意这些。这些缺点在我自己身上也随处可见，要是自己都站不直，就没必要再批评别人了。","However, take the paper by and large, I was vastly pleased with it.Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and there, but there were not enough of them to amount to anything, and it was good enough Arkansas proof-reading, anyhow, and better than was needed in Arthur’s day and realm.As a rule, the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame; but I did not much mind these things.They are common defects of my own, and one mustn’t criticise other people on grounds where he can’t stand perpendicular himself."
"我急于要读书看报，恨不得一口气就把这份报纸读完，饱餐一顿，哪知道刚咬了几口，就不得不停了下来，因为身边那群修道士们围着我急切地问长问短：这个怪怪的东西是什么呀？做什么用的？这是块手绢吗？——是马鞍毯？——是一片衬衫布？这是什么材料做成的呀？这东西多薄呀，很精致，也不结实，还哗啦哗啦响。你觉得能耐用吗，下雨不能淋坏吗？上面显示的那些是字，还是仅仅是装饰呀？他们怀疑是字，因为其中有些人认得拉丁文，对希腊语也略知一二，因此认出了其中几个字母，但是都凑在一起他们就猜不出是什么了。我尽可能用最简单的方式来讲解给他们听：","I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal, but I got only a few bites, and then had to postpone, because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions: What is this curious thing?What is it for?Is it a handkerchief?—saddle blanket?—part of a shirt?What is it made of?How thin it is, and how dainty and frail; and how it rattles.Will it wear, do you think, and won’t the rain injure it?Is it writing that appears on it, or is it only ornamentation?They suspected it was writing, because those among them who knew how to read Latin and had a smattering of Greek, recognized some of the letters, but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole.I put my information in the simplest form I could:"
"“这是一份公共刊物；至于什么是刊物，我下回再解释。这个不是布的，是纸做的；等有机会我再解释纸是什么东西。上面一行一行的就是要读的内容；不是手写的，而是印上去的；我会慢慢解释什么是印刷。这片纸一共印了一千张，都是一模一样的，丝毫不差——一点区别都没有。”　他们一听啧啧称赞，大声惊呼：","“It is a public journal; I will explain what that is, another time.It is not cloth, it is made of paper; some time I will explain what paper is.The lines on it are reading matter; and not written by hand, but printed; by and by I will explain what printing is.A thousand of these sheets have been made, all exactly like this, in every minute detail—they can’t be told apart.” 　Then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration:"
"“一千份！　果真工程巨大——要许多人干上一年吧。”","“A thousand!Verily a mighty work—a year’s work for many men.”"
"“不是——只不过一个成年人加一个小孩，一天就完成了。”","“No—merely a day’s work for a man and a boy.”"
"他们在胸前划着十字，轻轻祈祷一两句求上帝保佑。","They crossed themselves, and whiffed out a protective prayer or two."
"“啊——奇哉，妙哉！真乃鬼斧神工。”","“Ah-h—a miracle, a wonder!Dark work of enchantment.”"
"我任由他们大呼小叫。随后我开始低声念报纸，那些剃过的光头都一个劲地往前凑，凑到能听到的距离，我就把自己让泉水重流的那个神迹读了一段，从头到尾都夹杂着他们又是惊奇又是敬佩的喊叫：“啊呀！”“分毫不差！”　“妙哉，妙哉！”　“简直如临其境，一模一样，太神奇了！”他们问可不可以让他们把这怪东西放到手里，摸一摸，看一看？——他们一定会特别当心的。可以。　于是他们接过去，小心翼翼，心虔意诚，就仿佛是捧着个来自天界的神圣之物；他们轻轻抚摸感受着它的质地，不断摩挲着，抚弄它光滑舒适的表面，用着迷的眼神扫着那些充满神秘色彩的字。他们凑成一堆，低着头，这些个着了魔的面孔，会说话的眼睛——在我看来真是妙不可言！　难道这不是我的宝贝吗，修道士们那无声的惊奇，对它表现出来的兴趣和膜拜，不就是对它最有力的颂扬和最衷心的恭维吗？","I let it go at that.Then I read in a low voice, to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance, part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well, and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through: “Ah-h-h!” “How true!” “Amazing, amazing!” “These be the very haps as they happened, in marvelous exactness!” And might they take this strange thing in their hands, and feel of it and examine it?—they would be very careful.Yes. 　So they took it, handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region; and gently felt of its texture, caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch, and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes.These grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these speaking eyes—how beautiful to me!For was not this my darling, and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and unforced compliment to it?"
"此时我明白了一个母亲的感受，当女人们，无论是陌生人还是好友，接过她刚出生的婴儿，一下子激动地围住它，低着头，喜欢得不知怎么好，好像一时之间把周围的世界全都忘却了，好像别的根本就不存在似的。","I knew, then, how a mother feels when women, whether strangers or friends, take her new baby, and close themselves about it with one eager impulse, and bend their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consicousness and be as if it were not, for that time."
"我了解她的感受，无论是国王的，征服者的，抑或诗人的被满足的野心，还达不到她那宁静高远的欢乐顶峰的一半，也产生不了一半那绝妙的心满意足的感觉。","I knew how she feels, and that there is no other satisfied ambition, whether of king, conqueror, or poet, that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment."
"一直到这出拜神会结束，我的报纸从一群人手里跑到另一群人手里，在宽敞的大厅里传过来传过去，我那幸福的眼神一直追随着它，而我坐在那里纹丝不动，沉浸在满足中，陶醉在喜悦里。不错，这就是天堂，也许我再也体验不了了，不过我至少曾体验过一回。","During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye was upon it always, and I sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction, drunk with enjoyment.Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once, if I might never taste it more."
"第二十七章 美国人和国王匿名出行","CHAPTER 27 The Yankee and the King Travel Incognito"
"到了上床睡觉时，我把国王带到我个人的住处，给他理了发，帮他穿上他要穿的那身下等人的衣服。上等人前面的头发要剪齐覆额，四周的头发要垂到肩膀，而地位低一等的平民就要把前后头发都剪齐。奴隶则前后都不剪，任由头发自由生长。因此我把一只碗扣到他的头上，把垂在碗下面的头发都给剪掉。我还给他修剪了络腮胡和小胡子，剪到只有半英寸左右，我还努力把它弄得乱七八糟，很是成功。这简直是把人给毁容了。等到他穿上那双粗笨的草鞋，披上棕色粗亚麻布缝制的长袍，长袍从脖子一直拖到脚踝，他就不再是全国第一美男子，而是成为最难看、最普通、最不招人喜欢的男人之一了。我俩的穿着打扮一模一样，头发胡子也剪得一模一样，可以被当作小农场主，农场管家，放羊的，或者车把式，不错，还可以当成村里的手艺人，只要我们愿意，因为我们的衣服很耐穿，也非常便宜，穷人个个都穿这样的衣服。我不是指它对赤贫的人而言也很便宜，而是指对于男装而言它确实是最便宜的了——你明白，我说的是加工出来的衣料。","ABOUT bedtime I took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear.The high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around, whereas the lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both; the slaves were bangless, and allowed their hair free growth.So I inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it.I also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a half-inch long; and tried to do it inartistically, and succeeded.It was a villainous disfigurement.When he got his lubberly sandals on, and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth, which hung straight from his neck to his ankle-bones, he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom, but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive.We were dressed and barbered alike, and could pass for small farmers, or farm bailiffs, or shepherds, or carters; yes, or for village artisans, if we chose, our costume being in effect universal among the poor, because of its strength and cheapness.I don’t mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person, but I do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire—manufactured material, you understand."
"还有一个钟头天才亮，我俩就偷偷溜了出去，等到天大亮时，我们已经走了八九里路，来到一片人烟稀少的村落。我背的背包相当沉重，里面装着的都是食物——这些食物都是为国王准备的，好让他的饭量逐渐减少，直到他能吃了乡下的粗茶淡饭而不伤身子为止。","We slipped away an hour before dawn, and by broad sun-up had made eight or ten miles, and were in the midst of a sparsely settled country.I had a pretty heavy knapsack; it was laden with provisions—provisions for the king to taper down on, till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage."
"我在路边找个了舒服的地方请国王坐下，然后给了他一两口食物充饥。接着，我说我去给他找点水来，就走开了。我的目的之一是找个他看不着的地方坐下来，自个儿也歇一会儿。只要他在场我就老是站着，即使在商议国家大事的时候也是如此，只有偶尔几次，因为开会时间太长，一开几个小时，才让坐下；随后就给我个连靠背都没有的小东西，就像一截翻过来的阴沟，坐在上面那股舒服劲儿就跟牙痛一个样。我不想猛地一下子就把国王训练好，而是要一步一步来。有人在场的时候我俩不得不坐在一起，否则别人就会发现点什么；可是没有必要的时候，如果也和他平起平坐，那就不是什么上策。","I found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside, and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with.Then I said I would find some water for him, and strolled away.Part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself.It had always been my custom to stand when in his presence; even at the council board, except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one, extending over hours; then I had a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache.I didn’t want to break him in suddenly, but do it by degrees.We should have to sit together now when in company, or people would notice; but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it."
"我在三百码外找到了水，休息了有二十分钟，这时突然听到有人说话。应该没什么事吧，我想——准是农民上工去，没有别人会起得这么早。谁知顷刻之间，这些人就拐过路口，一路叮叮当当过来了——都是些衣着讲究的上等人，后面还跟着拉行李的骡子和仆人！我像箭一般嗖地跑开了，穿过灌木丛，抄了条近道。　有一阵我觉得这群人在我到达之前肯定会经过国王身边的，可是你知道，绝望能让人生出翅膀来，所以我向前探着身子，挺起胸脯，憋足气飞奔。我居然赶到了。而且时间还很充裕呢。","I found the water some three hundred yards away, and had been resting about twenty minutes, when I heard voices.That is all right, I thought—peasants going to work; nobody else likely to be stirring this early.But the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road—smartly clad people of quality, with luggage-mules and servants in their train!I was off like a shot, through the bushes, by the shortest cut. 　For a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before I could get to him; but desperation gives you wings, you know, and I canted my body forward, inflated my breast, and held my breath and flew.I arrived.And in plenty good enough time, too."
"“陛下请恕罪，不过没时间讲究礼节了——快起来！快站起来——有上等人来了！”","“Pardon, my king, but it’s no time for ceremony—jump!Jump to your feet—some quality are coming!”"
"“这有什么大惊小怪的？就让他们来好了。”","“Is that a marvel?Let them come.”"
"“可是，我的陛下呀！你可不能让他们看到坐在这儿。起来！——而且，在他们经过的时候你站的姿势还得谦卑点儿。要知道你现在可是个农民。”","“But my liege!You must not be seen sitting.Rise!—and stand in humble posture while they pass.You are a peasant, you know.”"
"“对呀——我都忘了，因为我正忙着计划大举进攻高卢国呢”——话说着他就站了起来，可是房地产市场行情见涨的时候一片农场都能比他起来得快——“正在此时，突然心生一念，阻碍了这伟大的梦想，这梦想——”","“True—I had forgot it, so lost was I in planning of a huge war with Gaul”—he was up by this time, but a farm could have got up quicker, if there was any kind of a boom in real estate—“and right-so a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream the which—”"
"“态度再谦卑点，我的陛下——快点！低下头！——再低点！——还要低！——耷拉下头！”","“A humbler attitude, my lord the king—and quick!Duck your head!—more!—still more!—droop it!”"
"他也算是尽力了，可是老天爷，也没见多大个效果。他那谦卑的态度看上去就跟比萨斜塔一样。你顶天也就只能这么说了。确实，成效之差劲令人乍舌，使那队人马经过时个个面带怒色，很是奇怪，队尾还有个衣着华丽的男仆把鞭子都扬起来了，不过我及时一纵身，在鞭子落下之前正好挡住了，这群人紧跟着发出一阵粗俗的笑声，在笑声的掩护下，我厉声警告国王叫他别理会。当时他控制住了，不过恨得咬牙切齿，他真想把那队人都生吞活剥了。我说：","He did his honest best, but lord, it was no great things.He looked as humble as the leaning tower at Pisa.It is the most you could say of it.Indeed, it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering scowls all along the line, and a gorgeous flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip; but I jumped in time and was under it when it fell; and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed, I spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice.He mastered himself for the moment, but it was a sore tax; he wanted to eat up the procession.I said:"
"“这样一来咱们的冒险事业刚开始就要告吹了，而且我们手无寸铁，也对付不了这群有刀有枪的家伙。要想成就功业，我们不仅得外表像农民，还得一举一动也跟农民一样。”","“It would end our adventures at the very start; and we, being without weapons, could do nothing with that armed gang.If we are going to succeed in our emprise, we must not only look the peasant but act the peasant.”"
"“此乃明智之举，无可厚非。继续上路吧，头子大人。我会多加留心，多多学习，尽力而为的。”","“It is wisdom; none can gainsay it. 　Let us go on, Sir Boss.I will take note and learn, and do the best I may.”"
"他果然说到做到。他尽了最大的努力，可结果怎样我心里再清楚不过了。如果你见过这样的孩子，鲁莽好动，闲不住，整天就琢磨变着法儿捣蛋，害得当妈的片刻不离跟在屁股后头，心焦火燎，仅仅能使他免于被水淹死或者玩什么新花样时把脖子扭断，你就等于看到国王和我了。","He kept his word.He did the best he could, but I’ve seen better.If you have ever seen an active, heedless, enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long, and an anxious mother at its heels all the while, and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment, you’ve seen the king and me."
"要是我早就预料到后果，我就该这么说了，哼，谁想靠把国王打扮成农民来展览混口饭吃，就让他折腾好了，我还不如去弄个巡回动物园，还能多活几天。而且，头三天我根本就没让他走进一间草屋或者别的什么住人的地方。在他见习初期，他的表现能过得去的地方就是小旅店和路上了；因此我们的活动场所就限于这种地方。不错，他确实是尽了力了，但是结果怎样呢？就我能看到的，他一点长进也没有。","If I could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like, I should have said, No, if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant, let him take the layout; I can do better with a menagerie, and last longer.And yet, during the first three days I never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling.If he could pass muster anywhere during his early novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road; so to these places we confined ourselves.Yes, he certainly did the best he could, but what of that?He didn’t improve a bit that I could see."
"他总是吓我一跳，总是在出人意料的新地方冷不丁地来个惊人之举。在第二天天快黑的时候，谁也想不到他竟然泰然自若地从袍子里摸出把匕首来！　","He was always frightening me, always breaking out with fresh astonishers, in new and unexpected places.Toward evening on the second day, what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside his robe!"
"“啊呀，我的陛下，您从哪里搞来这个？”","“Great guns, my liege, where did you get that?”"
"“在旅店从一个贩私货的那里弄来的，就昨晚。”","“From a smuggler at the inn, yester eve.”"
"“是什么让你鬼迷心窍买了这个？”","“What in the world possessed you to buy it?”"
"“你我屡次遇险，皆能凭借智谋化险为夷——是你的智谋——只是朕以为，要是朕能随身带件武器，岂不是更为保险。　紧急关头你也未必灵光。”","“We have escaped divers dangers by wit—thy wit—but I have bethought me that it were but prudence if I bore a weapon, too. 　Thine might fail thee in some pinch.”"
"“可是以咱们现在这种地位，是不允许携带武器的。领主会怎么说——不错，无论是什么身份的其他人——要是发现一个农民暴发户身上带着匕首，会怎么说？”","“But people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms.What would a lord say—yes, or any other person of whatever condition—if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person?”"
"当时没人经过，算我们幸运。我劝他把匕首扔掉，这简直就跟劝一个孩子放弃刚想出来的新把戏，别断送了自己的小命一样。我们向前走着，都不说话，各想心事。最终国王发话了：","It was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then.I persuaded him to throw the dirk away; and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself.We walked along, silent and thinking.Finally the king said:"
"“你明知道朕寻思出一件不妥之事，且有风险，为何不加以劝阻？”","“When ye know that I meditate a thing inconvenient, or that hath a peril in it, why do you not warn me to cease from that project?”"
"这问题让我大吃一惊，摸不着头脑。我不太明白该怎么接这句话，也不知道该说点什么，于是，我当然就顺嘴说了：","It was a startling question, and a puzzler.I didn’t quite know how to take hold of it, or what to say, and so, of course, I ended by saying the natural thing:"
"“可是，陛下，我如何能知道您心中所想呢？”","“But, sire, how can I know what your thoughts are?”"
"国王突然停住脚步，眼睛瞪着我。","The king stopped dead in his tracks, and stared at me."
"“朕原以为你比默林厉害，当然你在法术上确实如此。不过能预知事情要比法术更胜一筹。默林可是位预言家。”","“I believed thou wert greater than Merlin; and truly in magic thou art.But prophecy is greater than magic.Merlin is a prophet.”"
"我明白刚才说错话了。我必须收复失地。在一番深思熟虑和精心谋划之后，我说道：","I saw I had made a blunder.I must get back my lost ground.After a deep reflection and careful planning, I said:"
"“陛下误会了。容臣稍作说明。预言分两种。一种是预测马上就要发生的事情。一种是预测好多年好多世纪以后的事情。陛下认为哪种能力更了不起呢？”","“Sire, I have been misunderstood.I will explain.There are two kinds of prophecy.One is the gift to foretell things that are but a little way off, the other is the gift to foretell things that are whole ages and centuries away.Which is the mightier gift, do you think?”"
"“哦，自然是后者啦！”","“Oh, the last, most surely!”"
"“不错。那默林具备这能力吗？”","“True.Does Merlin possess it?”"
"“有几分吧。二十年前他预测出朕要出世并会继承王位这一天机。”","“Partly, yes.He foretold mysteries about my birth and future kingship that were twenty years away.”"
"“那他预测过超出这个范围的吗？”","“Has he ever gone beyond that?”"
"“朕以为他不会夸此海口的。”","“He would not claim more, I think.”"
"“或许这就是他的极限了。所有的预言师都有自己的极限。有些了不起的预言师，他们的极限是一百年。”","“It is probably his limit.All prophets have their limit.The limit of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years.”"
"“依朕看来，这等预言师定是凤毛麟角。”","“These are few, I ween.”"
"“还有两位更伟大的预言师，一位限度是四百年，一位是六百年，还有一位的限度甚至超过七百二十年。”","“There have been two still greater ones, whose limit was four hundred and six hundred years, and one whose limit compassed even seven hundred and twenty.”"
"“天啊，那可真是旷世少有！”","“Gramercy, it is marvelous!”"
"“可是跟我一比算得了什么？都不足挂齿。”","“But what are these in comparison with me?They are nothing.”"
"“什么？你真的能预知如此久远之后的事情，即使是远在——”","“What?Canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of time as—”"
"“七百年？陛下，我那能预测的眼睛洞察起差不多一千五百年间的事情来，都能跟老鹰的眼睛一样一清二楚，昭然若揭！”","“Seven hundred years?My liege, as clear as the vision of an eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half!”"
"老天爷，你真该看看，国王双眼慢慢越瞪越大，能把地球上空的大气层都顶起一英寸高！默林老哥就此完蛋了。跟这些人打交道，你根本就用不着去证明什么事实，你只需要把事实讲出来就够了。他们谁也不会去怀疑你说的话。","My land, you should have seen the king’s eyes spread slowly open, and lift the earth’s entire atmosphere as much as an inch!That settled Brer Merlin.One never had any occasion to prove his facts, with these people; all he had to do was to state them.It never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement."
"“好啦，那么，”我接着说道，“我这两种预言都会——预言很久之后和不久之后的事情——只要我不怕麻烦，勤练练就成，可是我一般除了预测很久以后的事情，很少预言别的，因为那样太掉价了。对于默林之流倒是更合适——用我们的行话来讲，就是那些秃尾巴预言师。当然，我一时来了兴致偶尔也会做个小小的预测，不过不常这么干——实际上几乎从不。陛下记得否，当陛下驾临圣洁谷时，大家都在纷纷议论，说我在两三天前就预知了圣上要大驾光临，并且还预测出驾临的准确时刻。”","“Now, then,” I continued, “I COULD work both kinds of prophecy—the long and the short—if I chose to take the trouble to keep in practice; but I seldom exercise any but the long kind, because the other is beneath my dignity.It is properer to Merlin’s sort—stump-tail prophets, as we call them in the profession.Of course, I whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy, but not often—hardly ever, in fact.You will remember that there was great talk, when you reached the Valley of Holiness, about my having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival, two or three days beforehand.”"
"“不错，嗯，朕记起来了。”","“Indeed, yes, I mind it now.”"
"“唉，要是换成五百年后，而不是两三天后的事情，我预测起来就会得心应手至少四十倍，另外细节上还要更考究一千倍呢。”","“Well, I could have done it as much as forty times easier, and piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain, if it had been five hundred years away instead of two or three days.”"
"“如此端的奇妙至极！”","“How amazing that it should be so!”"
"“对呀，只要是货真价实的行家，预测起五百年的事情来都要比预测五百秒不到的事情要简单的多。”","“Yes, a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five hundred years away easier than he can a thing that’s only five hundred seconds off.”"
"“可是按理说事实应该正好相反；预测后者本该比预测前者容易五百倍，因为后者离我们如此之近，即使是普通人也差不多能看明白。说真的，预言之法有悖常理，直教难者易，易者难。”","“And yet in reason it should clearly be the other way; it should be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first, for, indeed, it is so close by that one uninspired might almost see it.In truth, the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods, most strangely making the difficult easy, and the easy difficult.”"
"这脑袋瓜倒不坏。一顶农民的帽子要想把它遮起来根本不够；即使是戴着潜水帽，只要你能听到它动脑子的声音，你就能猜出来它是个国王的脑瓜。","It was a wise head.A peasant’s cap was no safe disguise for it; you could know it for a king’s under a diving-bell, if you could hear it work its intellect."
"现在我可有事做了，而且其中还是千头万绪呢。对于接下来的一千三百年里所发生的每一件事，国王都急于弄清楚，好像真以为自己还能活到那么久。从那时起，我为了满足他的需求，预测来预测去，忙得脑袋都秃了。想当年我也做过几件冒冒失失的事，然而冒充预言师算是最失策的了。不过，也不是一点好处也没有。预言师不需要动脑子。如果生活中遇到一般的急事，当然还是有点头脑好，可是在专职工作中就一点用处没有了。这是世上最悠闲自在的职业。当预言的魂魄附着到你身上的时候，你只需要把你的智慧都冻结起来，放到凉快的地方歇着，然后把下巴一卸，随它去，它就能自顾自地工作起来：产生的结果就是预言了。","I had a new trade now, and plenty of business in it.The king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them.From that time out, I prophesied myself bald-headed trying to supply the demand.I have done some indiscreet things in my day, but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst.Still, it had its ameliorations.A prophet doesn’t have to have any brains.They are good to have, of course, for the ordinary exigencies of life, but they are no use in professional work.It is the restfulest vocation there is.When the spirit of prophecy comes upon you, you merely cake your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave it alone; it will work itself: the result is prophecy."
"每天都有个把游侠骑士路过，每次一见到他们，国王的武士精神就会被点燃。他必定会忘记了自己的身份而去跟人家搭话，说话的口吻与他伪装的身份不符，惹人生疑，因此我总是及时把他从路上拉到一边去。这个时候他就会站在那儿，双目圆睁，眼中闪烁着傲慢的光芒，鼻孔也使劲张合着，跟战马一般，我知道他是想和人家大战一场呢。第三天晌午，我在路上停下来要采取点防护措施，两天前鞭子落到身上时我就想起了这茬，可那之后我并没有采取这个措施，心里实在是不乐意弄，可现在又出了一码子事再次提醒了我：我迈着大步朝前走，什么也没在意，嘴巴大张着，脑子闲置起来了，正忙着预言呢，正在此时，我脚下一绊，摔了个四脚朝天。当时我面色惨白，脑子都僵住了，很快我小心翼翼慢慢爬了起来，解下了背包。背包里有一枚炸弹，用羊毛包着，装在一个盒子里。随身带着炸弹挺好，说不定哪天我就能用它来制造个宝贵的奇迹，不过随身带着它也让我紧张，而我又不想让国王带着。可是我只能选择扔了它，或者想出个安全的法子来跟它和平相处。我把它拿出来，悄悄塞进我随身的小袋子里，可就在这时，过来了几个骑士。国王站在那儿跟雕像一般，直勾勾盯着他们——当然是又忘了自己此时的身份了——我还没来得及警告他一声，他就闪开了，也幸亏他闪开了。　他还以为人家能闪到一旁呢。人家闪到一旁免得踩到泥腿子农民吗？他自己何曾闪到一边过——或是说他何曾能有机会闪，要是农民见了他或者其他贵族骑士见了，定会及时果断闪开，谁还会让他找这个麻烦？骑士们压根就没有注意到国王这个人，国王身处这个位置，他就该自己留点神，他要不是躲开了肯定会被人家若无其事地撞倒了，还要在一旁大笑一番。","Every day a knight-errant or so came along, and the sight of them fired the king’s martial spirit every time.He would have forgotten himself, sure, and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree, and so I always got him well out of the road in time.Then he would stand and look with all his eyes; and a proud light would flash from them, and his nostrils would inflate like a war-horse’s, and I knew he was longing for a brush with them.But about noon of the third day I had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the whip-stroke that had fallen to my share two days before; a precaution which I had afterward decided to leave untaken, I was so loath to institute it; but now I had just had a fresh reminder: while striding heedlessly along, with jaw spread and intellect at rest, for I was prophesying, I stubbed my toe and fell sprawling.I was so pale I couldn’t think for a moment; then I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack.I had that dynamite bomb in it, done up in wool in a box. It was a good thing to have along; the time would come when I could do a valuable miracle with it, maybe, but it was a nervous thing to have about me, and I didn’t like to ask the king to carry it.Yet I must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society.I got it out and slipped it into my scrip, and just then here came a couple of knights.The king stood, stately as a statue, gazing toward them—had forgotten himself again, of course—and before I could get a word of warning out, it was time for him to skip, and well that he did it, too. 　He supposed they would turn aside.Turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot?When had he ever turned aside himself—or ever had the chance to do it, if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble?The knights paid no attention to the king at all; it was his place to look out himself, and if he hadn’t skipped he would have been placidly ridden down, and laughed at besides."
"国王怒火中烧，发出挑战，使出天下头一号的劲儿来破口大骂。此时骑士们已经走出去一段路了。　他们停了下来，大为震惊，勒住马鞍回头望着，好像在考虑像我们这样的卑贱小人物值不值得他们费事。　随后他们调转马头朝我们奔来。此时刻不容缓。我朝他们奔去。我飞快地跑着，一边跑一边骂，骂得人头发倒立，烈火焚心，前前后后骂了十三节，让国王那点可怜的努力相形见绌。这骂人话我是从人人都会骂人的十九世纪拿来的。　他们冲得太猛，快到国王跟前才听清，他们随即气得发疯，勒得马后腿站立，转了个圈，下一秒他们一字排开，朝这儿奔来。那时我正在七十码开外，正在爬上路边的一块大石头。在离我还有三十码远时，他们把长矛往下一顿，戴着头盔的脑袋往下一低，由此头上的马鬃盔缨在脑后高高飘扬，看起来煞是英武，他们就这样风驰电掣般朝我冲了过来！他们离我不到十五码时，我瞅准目标扔出了炸弹，正好扔在马鼻子底下。","The king was in a flaming fury, and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most royal vigor.The knights were some little distance by now. 　They halted, greatly surprised, and turned in their saddles and looked back, as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we.　Then they wheeled and started for us.Not a moment must be lost.I started for THEM.I passed them at a rattling gait, and as I went by I flung out a hair-lifting soulscorching thirteen-jointed insult which made the king’s effort poor and cheap by comparison.I got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how. 　They had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up; then, frantic with rage, they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around, and the next moment here they came, breast to breast.I was seventy yards off, then, and scrambling up a great bowlder at the roadside.When they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level, depressed their mailed heads, and so, with their horse-hair plumes streaming straight out behind, most gallant to see, this lightning express came tearing for me!When they were within fifteen yards, I sent that bomb with a sure aim, and it struck the ground just under the horses’ noses."
"不错，这招很干净，不仅干净还很有看头呢。　这就像一艘轮船在密西西比河上爆炸了一样，接下来的十五分钟里我们俩就站在下个不停的毛毛肉雨里，下得都是肉眼都看不到的碎末，是炸飞了的骑士及其马和装备。我说的是我们俩，因为国王刚能喘口气，就顺理成章地过来看热闹了。地上还留下了个大洞，够所有的当地人持续忙活好多年——我的意思是说忙活解释它的来历；至于填平它，这项工作相比较而言就很快了，会落在被选出来的几个人头上——就是那片领地的农民头上；而且他们肯定也得不到任何报酬。","Yes, it was a neat thing, very neat and pretty to see. 　It resembled a steamboat explosion on the Mississippi; and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and horse-flesh.I say we, for the king joined the audience, of course, as soon as he had got his breath again.There was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come—in trying to explain it, I mean; as for filling it up, that service would be comparatively prompt, and would fall to the lot of a select few—peasants of that seignory; and they wouldn’t get anything for it, either."
"可是我亲自给国王解说了一番。我说这是炸弹炸出来的，这消息对他没有任何损害，因为听完后他还和以前一样聪明。然而，在他眼里这可是了不起的奇迹，而且对于默林又是一个打击。我觉得不妨说这个奇迹非比寻常，一定要大气条件刚刚好时才能实施。否则只要我们一有好目标他就会求我施展一下，那样一来就会非常不便，因为我身上没有别的炸弹了。","But I explained it to the king myself.I said it was done with a dynamite bomb, This information did him no damage, because it left him as intelligent as he was before.However, it was a noble miracle, in his eyes, and was another settler for Merlin.I thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it couldn’t be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right.Otherwise he would be encoring it every time we had a good subject, and that would be inconvenient, because I hadn’t any more bombs along."
"第二十八章　训练国王","CHAPTER 28 Drilling the King"
"第四天清晨，太阳刚刚升起，我们已经在寒冷的清晨跋涉了一个钟头，此时我做了个决定：国王必须要训练一下。这样下去可不行，国王必须严加管教，必须要按部就班一丝不苟地训练他，否则我们就永远也不敢走进住人的地方了，就连人家家里的猫都看得出来，这位乔装打扮的人不是个农民，而是个冒牌货。因此我让他停下来，说道：","ON the morning of the fourth day, when it was just sunrise, and we had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn, I came to a resolution: the king MUST be drilled; things could not go on so, he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled, or we couldn’t ever venture to enter a dwelling; the very cats would know this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant.So I called a halt and said:"
"“陛下，就衣着和相貌而言，您没有问题，两者没什么不匹配的。可是在您的衣着和您的态度之间，就不大对头了，两者完全不搭调。您英武的步伐，不凡的气度——这些都不行。您站得太直，看起来又过于高傲，过于自信了。治理天下的人，不会佝偻着肩膀，耷拉着下巴，也不会压低那高远的目光，他们不会将疑虑和恐惧憋在心里，走起路来不会猫腰缩步，跟挂着幌子似的。只有那些出身低微、为生计担忧的人，才会这么做。您得找着窍门。贫穷，不幸，压迫，羞辱，还有其他种种屡见不鲜惨无人道的待遇，吸光了一个人的男子汉气概，将他变成一个忠心耿耿、中规中矩、百依百顺的属民，成了让主人满意的奴仆，所有的这些招牌品质您都要模仿，否则就连两三岁的孩子都知道您是假冒的，那样在我们还没踏进第一间茅草屋就玩完了。请试着这样走路。”","“Sire, as between clothes and countenance, you are all right, there is no discrepancy; but as between your clothes and your bearing, you are all wrong, there is a most noticeable discrepancy.Your soldierly stride, your lordly port—these will not do.You stand too straight, your looks are too high, too confident.The cares of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders, they do not droop the chin, they do not depress the high level of the eye-glance, they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them in slouching body and unsure step.It is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things.You must learn the trick; you must imitate the trademarks of poverty, misery, oppression, insult, and the other several and common inhumanities that sap the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters, or the very infants will know you for better than your disguise, and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at.Pray try to walk like this.”"
"国王仔细观察了观察，然后就学着走了一下。","The king took careful note, and then tried an imitation."
"“相当不错——相当不错。请再把下巴放低一点——对，不错。眼睛抬太高了，请不要看着天边，看着地面，看到你前面十步左右。啊——强多了，这次相当不错。请等一下，您显露出过多的精神头了，也太有决断了，您还得再拖着点脚走。请看着我——要这样做……您这次做对了，就是这样——至少，有点接近了……对，相当不错。且慢！还是缺了点重要的东西，我还没想明白是什么。请走三十码远，好让我判断一下……好，就那儿——头没有问题，速度也对，肩膀没问题，眼睛没问题，下巴没问题，步伐、姿态、总体的风范都没问题——一切都没有问题！　可总的来说还是不对劲。结果总是不和谐。请再来一遍……现在我有点明白是什么了。不错，我明白了。您瞧，您缺少真正无精打采的样子，这就是症结所在。整个就像业余演员——死板的细节都做得不错，几乎丝毫不差，骗人的方方面面都没得挑，就是骗不了人。”","“Pretty fair—pretty fair.Chin a little lower, please—there, very good.Eyes too high; pray don’t look at the horizon, look at the ground, ten steps in front of you.Ah—that is better, that is very good.Wait, please; you betray too much vigor, too much decision; you want more of a shamble.Look at me, please—this is what I mean....Now you are getting it; that is the idea—at least, it sort of approaches it....Yes, that is pretty fair.BUT! There is a great big something wanting, I don’t quite know what it is.Please walk thirty yards, so that I can get a perspective on the thing....Now, then—your head’s right, speed’s right, shoulders right, eyes right, chin right, gait, carriage, general style right—everything’s right!And yet the fact remains, the aggregate’s wrong.The account don’t balance.Do it again, please....NOW I think I begin to see what it is.Yes, I’ve struck it.You see, the genuine spiritlessness is wanting; that’s what’s the trouble.It’s all AMATUEUR—mechanical details all right, almost to a hair; everything about the delusion perfect, except that it don’t delude.”"
"“那么，该怎么做才能成功呢？”","“What, then, must one do, to prevail?”"
"“让我想想……我好像也想不出什么招来。实话说，除了练习，也没有什么补救的法子。这个地方用来练习就很好：地面上那么多树根和石头能打乱你英武的步伐，这地方也没人来打搅，能看得见的只有一片天地和一间茅屋，离得还很远，那儿的人根本不会看到我们的。咱们不妨离开大路，花一整天来训练一下您，陛下。”","“Let me think....I can’t seem to quite get at it.In fact, there isn’t anything that can right the matter but practice.This is a good place for it: roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait, a region not liable to interruption, only one field and one hut in sight, and they so far away that nobody could see us from there.It will be well to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you, sire.”"
"在练了一会儿之后，我说：","After the drill had gone on a little while, I said:"
"“陛下，现在假想一下我们来到远处那间茅屋的门口，面前有那一家子人。　请往下练习——和那家的一家之长打招呼。”","“Now, sire, imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder, and the family are before us. 　Proceed, please—accost the head of the house.”"
"国王不知不觉就挺直了身体，活像个纪念塔，冷若冰霜地说道：","The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument, and said, with frozen austerity:"
"“来人，搬个座位来，有什么好吃的尽管呈上来。”","“Varlet, bring a seat; and serve to me what cheer ye have.”"
"“啊呀，陛下，这可不对。”","“Ah, your grace, that is not well done.”"
"“有甚不当之处？”","“In what lacketh it?”"
"“这些人不会称呼对方为下人的。”","“These people do not call EACH OTHER varlets.”"
"“呀，果真如此？”","“Nay, is that true?”"
"“是呀，只有比他们地位高的人才那样称呼他们。”","“Yes; only those above them call them so.”"
"“那朕还得再来一遍。朕这次管他叫做奴隶。”","“Then must I try again.I will call him villein.”"
"“不行不行，也许他还是个自由民呢。”","“No-no; for he may be a freeman.”"
"“啊——这样啊。那我也许该称他为户主。”","“Ah—so. Then peradventure I should call him goodman.”"
"“这样也行，陛下，不过您要是能喊一声朋友或者老兄，就更好了。”","“That would answer, your grace, but it would be still better if you said friend, or brother.”"
"“老兄！——就这等草芥之人？”","“Brother!—to dirt like that?”"
"“啊，不过我们不也在假装是这等草芥之人吗。”","“Ah, but WE are pretending to be dirt like that, too.”"
"“那可也对。我就这么说吧。　老兄，搬个座位来，有什么好吃的尽管呈上来。现在对了吧。”","“It is even true.I will say it. 　Brother, bring a seat, and thereto what cheer ye have, withal.Now ’tis right.”"
"“不太对，还不完全正确。你光让他伺候一个人，而不是我们俩——是一个人，不是两个，饭食是为一个人，座位是为一个人。”","“Not quite, not wholly right.You have asked for one, not US—for one, not both; food for one, a seat for one.”"
"国王看起来有点迷糊了——他那小脑瓜并没有多沉。他的头脑就像个沙漏，倒是能装进去想法，可是一次只能装一点，不能一下子把整个想法都塞进去。","The king looked puzzled—he wasn’t a very heavy weight, intellectually.His head was an hour-glass; it could stow an idea, but it had to do it a grain at a time, not the whole idea at once."
"“你也要个座位——还要坐下？”","“Would YOU have a seat also—and sit?”"
"“要是我不坐下，那个人就会觉察我们是在假装平等了——还会发现我们骗人的把戏太拙劣了。”","“If I did not sit, the man would perceive that we were only pretending to be equals—and playing the deception pretty poorly, too.”"
"“说得太好了，太对了！无论形式怎样出人意料，真理说出来是何等美妙！不错，他须得为你我二人搬出座位，呈上饮食，服侍你我二人之时即使是递上洗手壶与餐巾也不能厚此薄彼。”","“It is well and truly said!How wonderful is truth, come it in whatsoever unexpected form it may!Yes, he must bring out seats and food for both, and in serving us present not ewer and napkin with more show of respect to the one than to the other.”"
"“还有一个小细节需要纠正。他无须把东西搬出去；我们要进去——来到草芥之人中间，也许还有别的什么让人反感的东西，混在一起——与那家人一起吃饭，遵循人家家里的规矩，要平起平坐，除非那家是农奴，最后，那儿不会有什么洗手壶和餐巾，无论他是农奴或是自由民。请再走两步，陛下。好——强多了——比哪回都强，不过还不是尽善尽美。您的双肩除了铁铠甲并没有挑过什么不体面的担子，因此不会拱肩缩背。”","“And there is even yet a detail that needs correcting.He must bring nothing outside; we will go in—in among the dirt, and possibly other repulsive things,—and take the food with the household, and after the fashion of the house, and all on equal terms, except the man be of the serf class; and finally, there will be no ewer and no napkin, whether he be serf or free.Please walk again, my liege.There—it is better—it is the best yet; but not perfect.The shoulders have known no ignobler burden than iron mail, and they will not stoop.”"
"“那就把行囊给朕吧。朕会学习那种肩负不体面担子时的精神状态。朕认为，那种拱肩缩背的精神状态，不是因为所担重量，因为铠甲也很沉，可披起来却很是自豪，披着的人莫不挺身而立……咄，勿得多言，休得反对。把那物件给朕。缚在朕背上。”","“Give me, then, the bag.I will learn the spirit that goeth with burdens that have not honor.It is the spirit that stoopeth the shoulders, I ween, and not the weight; for armor is heavy, yet it is a proud burden, and a man standeth straight in it....Nay, but me no buts, offer me no objections.I will have the thing.Strap it upon my back.”"
"背上了那个包袱，他现在可算是完整了，看上去比我见过的任何人都更不像个国王。可是他那双肩膀可真够倔的，那副弓着背的样子怎么学看上去都不自然。训练继续，我不时提醒修正一下。","He was complete now with that knapsack on, and looked as little like a king as any man I had ever seen.But it was an obstinate pair of shoulders; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness.The drill went on, I prompting and correcting:"
"“现在，假装你欠了一屁股债，被咬住不放的债主们纠缠不休，你还丢了工作——且说是钉马掌的吧——而且找不到事做，你的老婆又病了，孩子们饿得哇哇大哭——”","“Now, make believe you are in debt, and eaten up by relentless creditors; you are out of work—which is horse-shoeing, let us say—and can get none; and your wife is sick, your children are crying because they are hungry—”"
"诸如此类，等等等等。我训练他轮流代表各种各样时运不济、遭受极端困苦与不幸的人。可是，那就是说说而已，白费唇舌——对他来讲一点意义也没有，我还不如吹口哨呢。除非你亲身经历了，否则对你来说用言语来描述的事情怎么也不会真真切切，活灵活现。有些有识之士谈论起“工人阶级”来那真是头头是道，洋洋自得，还哄自己说一天辛苦的脑力劳作要比一天辛苦的体力劳作累得多，因此所得报酬理应要多得多。　哼，你知道，他们还真是这么想的，因为他们只了解一种工作，而另一种他们试都没试过。可是两种工作我都了解，就我而言，就算把世上的钱都给我，也不能支使我去抡三十天的镐头，可是脑力劳动再辛苦，即使你克扣工钱，相当于白干，我也乐意干——而且我还很满足呢。","And so on, and so on.I drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes.But lord, it was only just words, words—they meant nothing in the world to him, I might just as well have whistled.Words realize nothing, vivify nothing to you, unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe.There are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about “the working classes,” and satisfy themselves that a day’s hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day’s hard manual toil, and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay. 　Why, they really think that, you know, because they know all about the one, but haven’t tried the other.But I know all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there isn’t money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days, but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down—and I will be satisfied, too."
"脑力“劳动”这个词不对，这是一种乐趣，一种消遣，本身就是最高的回报。报酬最低的建筑家、工程师、将军、作家、雕刻家、画家、演说家、律师、立法者、演员、传道者和歌唱家，只要工作起来就等于在天堂了；至于手里握着琴弓的音乐家，坐在一大群管弦乐队中间，沐浴在此起彼伏的美妙音乐中——咳，的确，他是在劳动，要是你非得管这叫劳动的话，可是老天，说这话简直就是在讽刺他。劳动的法则看起来一点也不公平——可是事情就是这样，没法改变：劳动的人干活时获得的乐趣回报越高，挣得的金钱报酬也就越高。而且，那些显而易见的骗子，世袭的王公贵族，不都是遵循这个法则吗？","Intellectual “work” is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation, and is its own highest reward.The poorest paid architect, engineer, general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator, actor, preacher, singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work; and as for the musician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him—why, certainly, he is at work, if you wish to call it that, but lord, it’s a sarcasm just the same.The law of work does seem utterly unfair—but there it is, and nothing can change it: the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher shall be his pay in cash, also.And it’s also the very law of those transparent swindles, transmissible nobility and kingship."
"第二十九章　天花茅屋","CHAPTER 29 The Smallpox Hut"
"下午三点来钟，我们到了那间茅草屋，却没看到一点点生气。周围田地里的庄稼早就拔得精光，因为收割得太彻底了，看起来就跟剥了皮似的。篱笆，窝棚，都是一片荒芜景象，清清楚楚地展示着贫穷。周围连一只动物也找不到，眼前看不到活物。这儿一片沉寂，死一般的寂静。那小屋就一层，屋顶茅草因为天长日久都变黑了，因为疏于修缮而破败不堪。","WHEN we arrived at that hut at mid-afternoon, we saw no signs of life about it.The field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before, and had a skinned look, so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned.Fences, sheds, everything had a ruined look, and were eloquent of poverty.No animal was around anywhere, no living thing in sight.The stillness was awful, it was like the stillness of death.The cabin was a one-story one, whose thatch was black with age, and ragged from lack of repair."
"门是虚掩着的。我们蹑手蹑脚地靠近过去——踮着脚尖，屏住呼吸——因为在这种时刻你会感觉就该如此行事。国王敲了敲门。我们等了等。没人答应。再敲。还是没人答应。我轻轻把门推开往里瞧了瞧。　我隐约看到了几个身影，此时一个女人从地上站起来瞪着我，就好像刚从睡梦中醒来。很快她就开口说话了：","The door stood a trifle ajar.We approached it stealthily—on tiptoe and at half-breath—for that is the way one’s feeling makes him do, at such a time.The king knocked.We waited.No answer.Knocked again.No answer.I pushed the door softly open and looked in.　I made out some dim forms, and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me, as one does who is wakened from sleep.Presently she found her voice:"
"“发发善心吧！”她恳求道，“都拿走了，什么也留下。”","“Have mercy!” she pleaded.“All is taken, nothing is left.”"
"“我不是来拿你东西的，可怜的女人。","“I have not come to take anything, poor woman.”"
"“你不是神父吗？”","“You are not a priest?”"
"“不是。”","“No.”"
"“也不是奉采邑领主之命来的？”","“Nor come not from the lord of the manor?”"
"“不是，我是从外面来的。”","“No, I am a stranger.”"
"“噢，那么，你难道不怕上帝吗，他降下灾祸和死亡，连无罪之人也不能幸免，别在这儿逗留了，快快离去！这个地方遭了他的诅咒了——还有他那教会的诅咒。”","“Oh, then, for the fear of God, who visits with misery and death such as be harmless, tarry not here, but fly!This place is under his curse—and his Church’s.”"
"“让我进去帮你一把——你都病了，还遭了难。”","“Let me come in and help you—you are sick and in trouble.”"
"此时我有点习惯了那昏暗的光线。我能看到她那凹陷的双眼正盯着我。　我能看出来她是多么的憔悴。","I was better used to the dim light now.I could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me. 　I could see how emaciated she was."
"“我告诉你吧，这个地方已经被教会给封了。　逃命去吧——快走，免得被闲散人等看到，报告给教会。”","“I tell you the place is under the Church’s ban. 　Save yourself—and go, before some straggler see thee here, and report it.”"
"“别担心我，我才不担心被教会诅咒呢。让我帮帮你吧。”","“Give yourself no trouble about me; I don’t care anything for the Church’s curse.Let me help you.”"
"“愿所有圣明的神灵——假如真有这样的神灵——保佑说这话的您吧。苍天啊，我多想喝口水啊！——可是打住，打住，忘了我刚才所说的，赶紧离开吧，因为在这儿即便不怕教会，你也当有所畏惧：我们一家人皆死于此病。　不要管我们了，行侠仗义的外地好心人，我虽然身遭天谴，还是全心全意真心祝福您一路顺风。”","“Now all good spirits—if there be any such—bless thee for that word.Would God I had a sup of water!—but hold, hold, forget I said it, and fly; for there is that here that even he that feareth not the Church must fear: this disease whereof we die. 　Leave us, thou brave, good stranger, and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give.”"
"但她话还没说完，我就抄起个木碗，经过国王身边，朝着小溪跑去。小溪在十码之外。当我回来走进小屋时，国王已经在里面了，正打开窗板把空气和光线从窗眼放进来。这个地方臭烘烘的。我把碗递到那个女人唇边，她急忙用瘦骨嶙峋的手死死抓住，正在这时窗板打开了，一束亮光照在她的脸上。是天花！","But before this I had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the brook.It was ten yards away.When I got back and entered, the king was within, and was opening the shutter that closed the window-hole, to let in air and light.The place was full of a foul stench.I put the bowl to the woman’s lips, and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face.Smallpox!"
"我跳到国王身边，附耳说道：","I sprang to the king, and said in his ear:"
"“陛下，快出去！这个女人得了一种病快死了，这病在两年前曾让卡米洛四郊一片荒凉。”","“Out of the door on the instant, sire!the woman is dying of that disease that wasted the skirts of Camelot two years ago.”"
"他不为所动。","He did not budge."
"“说真的，朕该留下来——而且还要施以援手。”","“Of a truth I shall remain—and likewise help.”"
"我又小声说了一遍：","I whispered again:"
"“陛下，您不能这样做。　您必须离开。”","“King, it must not be. 　You must go.”"
"“你是出于好心，说的话也不是没有道理。可是身为一国之君，岂能心怀畏惧，况且遇到这等需要帮助之人，却甩手不管，对于系着荣誉绶带的骑士来说岂不是奇耻大辱。住嘴，朕决不离开。　你才应该离开呢。　教会的禁令管不住朕，可是能禁止你来此地，若是得知你私闯禁地，教会将严惩不贷。”","“Ye mean well, and ye speak not unwisely.But it were shame that a king should know fear, and shame that belted knight should withhold his hand where be such as need succor.Peace, I will not go. 　It is you who must go. 　The Church’s ban is not upon me, but it forbiddeth you to be here, and she will deal with you with a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass.”"
"他在这个地方呆着可太危险了，说不定会丢了性命，可是跟他争论也没有用。他如果认为眼下需要捍卫他的骑士荣誉，那就不用争论了，他会留下来，什么也挡不住，我很明白这点。因此我就不提这事了。那个女人说话了：","It was a desperate place for him to be in, and might cost him his life, but it was no use to argue with him.If he considered his knightly honor at stake here, that was the end of argument; he would stay, and nothing could prevent it; I was aware of that.And so I dropped the subject.The woman spoke:"
"“尊敬的先生，能否好心爬上那边的梯子，把看到的情形说与我听听？看到什么不要有顾虑，尽管告诉我，到了一定时候，即使是当妈的也不会心碎——因为心早就碎完了。”","“Fair sir, of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there, and bring me news of what ye find?Be not afraid to report, for times can come when even a mother’s heart is past breaking—being already broke.”"
"“且慢，”国王说道，“给这个女人点吃的。我去。”　随后他把背囊解了下来。","“Abide,” said the king, “and give the woman to eat.I will go.” And he put down the knapsack."
"我转过身要走，可是国王已经先动身了。他突然止住，低头看着一个男人躺在微弱的光线下，始终没注意到我们，或者说没有说话。","I turned to start, but the king had already started.He halted, and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light, and had not noticed us thus far, or spoken."
"“此人是你丈夫？”国王问道。","“Is it your husband?” the king asked."
"“不错。”","“Yes.”"
"“他睡着了？”","“Is he asleep?”"
"“感谢上帝怜悯，是的——三个小时了。这等大恩教我如何报答！他能安然入睡，我心里真是不胜感激。”","“God be thanked for that one charity, yes—these three hours.Where shall I pay to the full, my gratitude! for my heart is bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now.”"
"我说道：","I said:"
"“我们会当心的。不会吵醒他。”","“We will be careful.We will not wake him.”"
"“啊，不，你们不用当心了，因为他已经死了。”","“Ah, no, that ye will not, for he is dead.”"
"“死了？”","“Dead?”"
"“不错，得知此事让我好不欢欣！再也没人能伤害他，再羞辱他了。他现在去了天堂，好不快活；或是没去天堂，那他一定在地狱，也会心满意足；因为在地狱里既没有修道院院长也没有主教。我俩从小青梅竹马，又做了二十五年夫妻，直到临死也没分开过。　我们恩恩爱爱，同甘共苦，真是天长地久。今天早上他就神志不清了，胡思乱想，认为我俩又回到了孩童时代，欢快地在田野里游荡；两人说着些童言稚语，边走边谈，他越走越远，还在轻声聊着，直到进入那未知的世界，天人相隔，再也见不到了。因此我俩从未分离，在他的想象里我一直跟随着他；他只道我跟随着他，手拉着手——是我年轻时柔软的小手，而不是这只干瘪的爪子。啊，是的，走了，也不知道分离的滋味；要分离了，也不知道；人如何能如此安然而逝——有比这更安然的吗？他一生默默熬尽悲苦，这也算是对他的补偿吧。”","“Yes, what triumph it is to know it!None can harm him, none insult him more.He is in heaven now, and happy; or if not there, he bides in hell and is content; for in that place he will find neither abbot nor yet bishop.We were boy and girl together; we were man and wife these five and twenty years, and never separated till this day. 　Think how long that is to love and suffer together.This morning was he out of his mind, and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields; and so in that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther, still lightly gossiping, and entered into those other fields we know not of, and was shut away from mortal sight.And so there was no parting, for in his fancy I went with him; he knew not but I went with him, my hand in his—my young soft hand, not this withered claw.Ah, yes, to go, and know it not; to separate and know it not; how could one go peace—fuller than that?It was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne.”"
"从昏暗的角落里，就是梯子那边传来轻微的声响。那是国王正在走下梯子。我能看出他一只手扶着梯子，另一只胳膊里抱着什么东西。　他来到亮点的地方，在他怀里躺着个十五岁的苗条姑娘。她得的是天花，已经奄奄一息，人事不省了。这种英雄气概真可谓前无古人后无来者，登峰造极；这是赤手空拳公开挑战死神，没有一分胜算，赢了也没有任何报酬，也不会有身着绫罗绸缎、披金挂银的观众啧啧称赞，瞩目喝彩；可是国王的神态沉静英勇，和平常比赛中的骑士们势均力敌，身上还披着有保护作用的钢甲一样。他现在真是伟大，伟大绝顶。他王宫里陈列的那些粗劣的祖宗雕像应该再添一尊——我会负责这件事的；不是加一尊全身披挂的国王杀死巨人或巨蟒的像，和其他雕像那样，而是一位平民打扮的国王，怀抱着死神，为得是让一位农民母亲最后再看一眼孩子，略得慰藉。","There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was.It was the king descending.I could see that he was bearing something in one arm, and assisting himself with the other.He came forward into the light; upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen.She was but half conscious; she was dying of smallpox.Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility, its utmost summit; this was challenging death in the open field unarmed, with all the odds against the challenger, no reward set upon the contest, and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud; and yet the king’s bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel.He was great now; sublimely great.The rude statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an addition—I would see to that; and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon, like the rest, it would be a king in commoner’s garb bearing death in his arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and be comforted."
"他把姑娘放到她母亲的身边，那位母亲爱子心切，又是亲吻又是抚摸，只见那孩子的眼睛微微闪了几下，然后就没有反应了。　母亲扑在她身上，亲吻她，抚摸她，恳求她开口说话，可是她的嘴唇只是动了动，没发出声来。我从背囊里一把掏出酒瓶来，可是那个女人拦住了我，说道：","He laid the girl down by her mother, who poured out endearments and caresses from an overflowing heart, and one could detect a flickering faint light of response in the child’s eyes, but that was all. 　The mother hung over her, kissing her, petting her, and imploring her to speak, but the lips only moved and no sound came.I snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack, but the woman forbade me, and said:"
"“不——她不会遭罪了，这样更好。酒会让她再活过来的。您这等好心之人，如此仁慈，定不会忍心伤害她。因为您瞧瞧——活着还有什么意思？她的兄弟们都死了，父亲死了，母亲早晚也要死了，教会还要降罚于她，即使她躺在路边，慢慢死去，也不会有人收留她或帮她一把的。她已是孤苦伶仃了。我还没问您呢，好心人，她妹妹可还活着，她就在上边；其实我也无需再问，要是还活着，您肯定能回去一趟，不会扔下那可怜的孩子不管——”","“No—she does not suffer; it is better so.It might bring her back to life.None that be so good and kind as ye are would do her that cruel hurt.For look you—what is left to live for?Her brothers are gone, her father is gone, her mother goeth, the Church’s curse is upon her, and none may shelter or befriend her even though she lay perishing in the road.She is desolate.I have not asked you, good heart, if her sister be still on live, here overhead; I had no need; ye had gone back, else, and not left the poor thing forsaken—”"
"“她已经安息了。”国王插了句嘴，声音低沉。","“She lieth at peace,” interrupted the king, in a subdued voice."
"“这样最好了。　今天真是福星高照！啊，我的安妮丝，你很快就能和妹妹团聚了——你已经上路了，这两位仁慈的朋友不会阻拦你的。”","“I would not change it. 　How rich is this day in happiness!Ah, my Annis, thou shalt join thy sister soon—thou’rt on thy way, and these be merciful friends that will not hinder.”"
"随后她又趴下对着那姑娘嘀嘀咕咕，轻声软语，温柔地抚摸着姑娘的脸和头发，亲吻着她，心肝宝贝地叫着；可是如今那双慢慢暗淡下来的眼睛再也没有一点反应了。我瞧见眼泪从国王眼眶里涌了出来，一滴一滴淌落脸颊。那个女人也注意到了，说道：","And so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again, and softly stroking her face and hair, and kissing her and calling her by endearing names; but there was scarcely sign of response now in the glazing eyes.I saw tears well from the king’s eyes, and trickle down his face.The woman noticed them, too, and said:"
"“啊，这个我明白了：你一定也有妻子在家，可怜的家伙，你和她屡屡饿着肚子就上床睡觉了，为了省下那一星半点粮食给小崽子们吃；你知道贫穷的滋味，比你地位高的人天天羞辱你，教会和国王也对你痛下重手。”","“Ah, I know that sign: thou’st a wife at home, poor soul, and you and she have gone hungry to bed, many’s the time, that the little ones might have your crust; you know what poverty is, and the daily insults of your betters, and the heavy hand of the Church and the king.”"
"这无意说出的话碰到了国王的痛处，他眨了眨眼睛，不过没有出声。他正学着扮演他的角色，而且对于一个甚是愚笨的初学者来说演得还不错。我岔开了话题。我给那女人拿了点食物和酒，不过她两样都拒绝了。她一心只想死掉，早点解脱，根本不允许什么东西来插一杠子。随后我偷偷溜开，把那个死去的孩子从上面搬了下来，放到她身边。这让她再次陷入崩溃，又是一副伤心欲绝的场面。过了一会儿我又一次转移她的注意力，哄她讲讲她的故事。","The king winced under this accidental home-shot, but kept still; he was learning his part; and he was playing it well, too, for a pretty dull beginner.I struck up a diversion.I offered the woman food and liquor, but she refused both.She would allow nothing to come between her and the release of death.Then I slipped away and brought the dead child from aloft, and laid it by her.This broke her down again, and there was another scene that was full of heartbreak.By and by I made another diversion, and beguiled her to sketch her story."
"“您二位也都是受过苦的人，肯定也都很明白——因为全英国像我们这等地位的人谁能逃得了呢。这个故事都老掉牙了。我们奋力抗争，苦苦挣扎，终于获得了成功。我说成功，是指我们终于活了下来，没有死掉，其余的事情哪敢奢望。无论什么大灾小难，我们还是存活了下来，直到今年，灾祸频降，而且可以说是接踵而至，一下子把我们压垮了。　多年以前采邑的领主曾在我们的田庄上栽了些果树，而且是在最好的田庄上——荒唐透顶，无耻之极——”","“Ye know it well yourselves, having suffered it—for truly none of our condition in Britain escape it.It is the old, weary tale.We fought and struggled and succeeded; meaning by success, that we lived and did not die; more than that is not to be claimed.No troubles came that we could not outlive, till this year brought them; then came they all at once, as one might say, and overwhelmed us. 　Years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm; in the best part of it, too—a grievous wrong and shame—”"
"“不过他有那个权力。”国王插嘴道。","“But it was his right,” interrupted the king."
"“的确，没人敢说不是；而且依法而论，领主的是领主的，我们的也是领主的。我们的田庄是租来的，因此同样也是他的，他想拿它干嘛就干嘛。前不久，这些果树有三棵不知被谁砍倒了。　我那三个已经成年的儿子吓坏了，急忙跑去报案。唉，他们却被关进了领主的土牢里，领主说要是他们不招供，就一直在那儿躺着，直到烂掉。要他们招个什么，他们可是清白的，因此他们要一直呆在里面，直到死。　我想您二位也都很清楚其中情形吧。二位想想，这样一来给我们留下的烂摊子：夫妻二人加两个孩子，要收割许多劳力耕种下的庄稼，不错，还要日夜看护以防鸽子和其他四处觅食的禽畜，这些动物都被视为神明，我等伤害不得。等领主家的庄稼熟了要收割时，我们家的也熟了；领主铃儿一响，召唤我们去他家地里收割庄稼，分文不给，而且还不许我和我那两个女孩儿顶替被抓的三个儿子，只准顶替两个，因此因为缺个人我们每天还得被罚款。在此期间我们自己的庄稼由于没人管理一天天荒废了，因此神父和领主也要罚我们款，因为他们应得的那份也受到了损失。最终罚款把粮食都罚光了——他们把粮食都拿走了，他们都拿走了，还要我们给他们收割，不给钱也不管饭，我们忍饥挨饿。随后最糟糕的事情发生了，我饿的不行，又失去了儿子，还得眼睁睁看着自己的丈夫和小女儿们衣衫褴褛，悲苦绝望，因此有点失心疯，说了句大为不敬的话——哦！说一千遍才好呢！——咒骂教会和教会的诸多行径。那是十天前的事了。我身染此疾，病倒了，神父来责骂我，说我在上帝降罚时不够谦卑，因此我就骂了他。他就将我的罪过呈报了上去，我死不认错。因此，不久之后罗马就降罪到我和我至亲骨肉的头上了。","“None denieth that, indeed; an the law mean anything, what is the lord’s is his, and what is mine is his also.Our farm was ours by lease, therefore ’twas likewise his, to do with it as he would.Some little time ago, three of those trees were found hewn down.Our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime.Well, in his lordship’s dungeon there they lie, who saith there shall they lie and rot till they confess.They have naught to confess, being innocent, wherefore there will they remain until they die. 　Ye know that right well, I ween.Think how this left us; a man, a woman and two children, to gather a crop that was planted by so much greater force, yes, and protect it night and day from pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt by any of our sort.When my lord’s crop was nearly ready for the harvest, so also was ours; when his bell rang to call us to his fields to harvest his crop for nothing, he would not allow that I and my two girls should count for our three captive sons, but for only two of them; so, for the lacking one were we daily fined.All this time our own crop was perishing through neglect; and so both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares of it were suffering through damage.In the end the fines ate up our crop—and they took it all; they took it all and made us harvest it for them, without pay or food, and we starving.Then the worst came when I, being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys, and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery and despair, uttered a deep blasphemy—oh! a thousand of them!—against the Church and the Church’s ways.It was ten days ago.I had fallen sick with this disease, and it was to the priest I said the words, for he was come to chide me for lack of due humility under the chastening hand of God.He carried my trespass to his betters; I was stubborn; wherefore, presently upon my head and upon all heads that were dear to me, fell the curse of Rome."
"从那时起，人人对我们都惶恐不已，唯恐避之不及。没人来茅屋看看我们是死是活。家里其他人都病倒了。因此我只得强打精神爬了起来，作为妻子和母亲只能这样做。无论如何，他们也吃不下去东西，其实也没有什么东西给他们吃。不过这儿还有水，因此我就喂他们水喝。他们多么想喝水呀！上帝保佑他们还有水喝！然而昨日万事皆休，我没有力气了。昨天是最后一天，我见到自己的丈夫和小女儿还活着。我躺在这里这些个钟头——也可以说是这些个世纪——一直在听着，听上面有没有什么动静——”","Since that day we are avoided, shunned with horror.None has come near this hut to know whether we live or not.The rest of us were taken down.Then I roused me and got up, as wife and mother will.It was little they could have eaten in any case; it was less than little they had to eat.But there was water, and I gave them that.How they craved it!and how they blessed it!But the end came yesterday; my strength broke down.Yesterday was the last time I ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive.I have lain here all these hours—these ages, ye may say—listening, listening for any sound up there that—”"
"她突然飞快地扫了一眼自己的大女儿，随即大喊一声“啊呀，我的宝贝！”，有气无力地把慢慢僵硬的尸体揽入自己的怀里。她听出了人临死前的喉鸣声。","She gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter, then cried out, “Oh, my darling!” and feebly gathered the stiffening form to her sheltering arms.She had recognized the death-rattle."
"第三十章　庄园的悲剧","CHAPTER 30 The Tragedy of the Manor-House"
"午夜时分，一切都结束了，我们坐在那儿，面对着四具尸体。我俩好不容易找了点破布把尸体盖住，就关上门离开了。　他们的房子只能做他们的坟墓了，因为他们不能举行基督教的葬礼，也不能被允许埋到神圣的基督教墓地里。他们就像狗，像野兽，像麻风病人一样，人见人骂，人人喊打，为世人所遗弃，任他是谁，只要还把获得永生当回事，就决不会多管这家人的闲事。","AT midnight all was over, and we sat in the presence of four corpses.We covered them with such rags as we could find, and started away, fastening the door behind us. 　　Their home must be these people’s grave, for they could not have Christian burial, or be admitted to consecrated ground.They were as dogs, wild beasts, lepers, and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and smitten outcasts."
"我们走出还没有四步远，就听到有人在石子路上走动的声音。我的心都跳到嗓子眼儿了。我们可不能让人看见从这个屋子走出去。我拉了拉国王的袍子，我俩就退了回去，躲在小屋的角落里。","We had not moved four steps when I caught a sound as of footsteps upon gravel.My heart flew to my throat.We must not be seen coming from that house.I plucked at the king’s robe and we drew back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin."
"“现在我们安全了，” 我说道，“不过也是千钧一发——可以这么说。要不是夜里天黑，他一定早就看到我们了，他好像离我们很近。”","“Now we are safe,” I said, “but it was a close call—so to speak.If the night had been lighter he might have seen us, no doubt, he seemed to be so near.”"
"“也许就是只野兽，压根就不是人。”","“Mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all.”"
"不错。不过无论是人是兽，我们还是在这儿呆一会儿，让它走过去，总没错。”","“True.But man or beast, it will be wise to stay here a minute and let it get by and out of the way.”"
"“听！它走过来了。”","“Hark!It cometh hither.”"
"这回也没错。脚步冲着我们来了——直奔这间茅屋。肯定是头野兽，那么，我们就用不着这样恐惧了。我正要迈脚出去，国王却一把拽住了我的胳膊。片刻的寂静过后，我们听到有人在轻轻地敲小屋的门。我吓得直哆嗦。不一会儿那人又敲了一次，接着我们就听到一个谨慎的声音说道：","True again.The step was coming toward us—straight toward the hut.It must be a beast, then, and we might as well have saved our trepidation.I was going to step out, but the king laid his hand upon my arm.There was a moment of silence, then we heard a soft knock on the cabin door.It made me shiver.Presently the knock was repeated, and then we heard these words in a guarded voice:"
"“娘！爹！ 开门——我们出来了，你们听到我们带来的消息必定会吓得脸色煞白，但心里必定会很欢喜；我们不能再留在这里了，必须马上离开！而且——怎么没人回答。娘！爹！——”","“Mother!Father! Open—we have got free, and we bring news to pale your cheeks but glad your hearts; and we may not tarry, but must fly!And—but they answer not.Mother! father!—”"
"我把国王拉到小屋那头，悄声说道：","I drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered:"
"“来——如今我们可以到大路上走了。”","“Come—now we can get to the road.”"
"国王犹豫了一下，正要反对，可就在此时我们听到门开了，知道那几个可怜的人已经来到了他们死去的亲人面前。","The king hesitated, was going to demur; but just then we heard the door give way, and knew that those desolate men were in the presence of their dead."
"“快点，陛下！他们马上就会点个亮儿，然后就会响起令你心碎的声音了。”","“Come, my liege!in a moment they will strike a light, and then will follow that which it would break your heart to hear.”"
"这次他没有犹豫。一上了大路我就跑了起来,不一会儿国王也放下架子，跟着我跑起来。我不愿去想茅屋里现在正发生着怎样的事情——我不忍心想,我只想把这事从脑子里赶出去,所以我一下子想起来在我心底除了这个问题之外最让我挂念的事情：","He did not hesitate this time.The moment we were in the road I ran; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed.I did not want to think of what was happening in the hut—I couldn’t bear it; I wanted to drive it out of my mind; so I struck into the first subject that lay under that one in my mind:"
"“要了那些人性命的那种疾病，我也曾得过，因此用不着害怕；可是您不曾得过，却还——”","“I have had the disease those people died of, and so have nothing to fear; but if you have not had it also—”"
"国王突然打断我，说他现在很烦恼，他的良心在不断折磨着他：","He broke in upon me to say he was in trouble, and it was his conscience that was troubling him:"
"“那几个小伙子说自己出来了——可是怎么出来的？不可能是领主把他们释放了。”","“These young men have got free, they say—but HOW?It is not likely that their lord hath set them free.”"
"“哦，不能，我敢肯定他们是逃出来的。”","“Oh, no, I make no doubt they escaped.”"
"“这就是让朕烦恼的地方,朕一直担心他们是越狱出来的，而你的疑虑也证实了这点，你我担心之事如出一辙。”","“That is my trouble; I have a fear that this is so, and your suspicion doth confirm it, you having the same fear.”"
"“可是我才不会那么说呢。我确实怀疑他们是逃出来的，但是如果属实，我可不会感到遗憾，真的。”","“I should not call it by that name though.I do suspect that they escaped, but if they did, I am not sorry, certainly.”"
"“我也不是感到遗憾，我认为——可是——”","“I am not sorry, I THINK—but—”"
"“怎么了？您到底为什么而烦恼呢？”","“What is it?What is there for one to be troubled about?”"
"“若他们的确是逃出来的，我们责无旁贷要把他们抓住移送到他们领主手中，以领主如此尊贵身份却遇到这等低贱之人傲慢专横的暴行，未免有失体统。”","“IF they did escape, then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon them and deliver them again to their lord; for it is not seemly that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed outrage from persons of their base degree.”"
"又来了。他就只能看到事物的一面。那样的出身，那样的教育，让他的血管里流动着老祖先的血液，那是野蛮残忍却浑然不觉的腐朽血液，由他的祖先代代相传，每位列祖列宗的心脏都贡献出了自己的一份力量，给他的血脉添了点毒。毫无证据就可以把这些人监禁起来，把他们的亲人都饿死，并不碍什么事，因为他们不过是农民，任由他们的领主处置，领主想怎样就怎样，乐意怎样就怎样，不管采取怎样可怕的方式都行；可是这些人要是从非法拘禁的地方逃出来，就是对领主的侮辱，就是暴行，那些对自己神圣的阶级尽职尽责的人，只要还有良心，就决不能姑息纵容。","There it was again.He could see only one side of it.He was born so, educated so, his veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality, brought down by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done its share toward poisoning the stream.To imprison these men without proof, and starve their kindred, was no harm, for they were merely peasants and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord, no matter what fearful form it might take; but for these men to break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage, and a thing not to be countenanced by any conscientious person who knew his duty to his sacred caste."
"我费了半个多小时才让他换了个话题——而且还是靠着外来的力量。　当我们爬到一个小山包的山顶时，我们看到了个什么东西——一道红光，在很远的地方。","I worked more than half an hour before I got him to change the subject—and even then an outside matter did it for me. 　This was a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small hill—a red glow, a good way off."
"“是着火了吧。”我说道。","“That’s a fire,” said I."
"我对火灾相当感兴趣，因为我已经开展了大量的保险业务，而且还训练了许多马匹，建造了蒸汽救火车，还准备渐渐着手组建带薪消防队。那些神父们既反对我的火灾保险，又反对我的人寿保险，理由是，这样做就是对上帝大不敬，就是企图违抗天意；而你要指出这样根本不会有违上帝旨意，只不过是保了险，而且运气不错的话，会改变一下那悲惨的后果，他们又该反驳你了，说你这是投机冒险来违抗上帝旨意，还不是一样恶劣。　因此他们多多少少还是给这项产业带来些损失，不过我又从意外伤害保险上给补齐了。骑士十有八九都是笨蛋，有时甚至是个浑虫，因此不管那些传播迷信的人说得有多离谱，他们总是毫不犹豫一头就扎了进去，可是即使是这样的人偶尔也能识点实务。因此，在近期的比武大赛中，你要是打扫战场，把比武剩下的那堆东西堆到一起，无论在哪个头盔里都能发现一张我的那种意外伤害保险单。","Fires interested me considerably, because I was getting a good deal of an insurance business started, and was also training some horses and building some steam fire-engines, with an eye to a paid fire department by and by.The priests opposed both my fire and life insurance, on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of God; and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least, but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck, they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of God, and was just as bad. 　So they managed to damage those industries more or less, but I got even on my Accident business.As a rule, a knight is a lummox, and some times even a labrick, and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger, but even HE could see the practical side of a thing once in a while; and so of late you couldn’t clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet."
"四周一片漆黑和寂静，我们在那儿站了一会儿，看着远处那片模模糊糊的红光，听到远处传来一阵低柔的声音，在夜色中忽高忽低，断断续续，我们很想弄明白这是什么声音。有时这声音扬了起来，一时间好像没那么远了，可是当我们因此满怀希望以为能发现它的来源一探究竟时，它又突然模糊起来，越来越低，把它的秘密也带走了。我们追随着声音的方向动身朝山下走去，曲折蜿蜒的山路又把我们领入了几乎凝固的黑暗之中——两边的树林仿佛两道高墙，里面被这黑暗塞得满满当当。我们摸索着往下走了也许有半里地，此时那模糊的声音变得越来越清晰了。即将到来的暴风雨也越逼越近，时不时就刮起一阵微风，或是打起一阵隐隐约约的闪电，还有远远传来轰隆隆的闷雷声。我走在头里。突然间我撞上了什么东西——那东西很软很沉，在我一撞之下稍微晃动了一点。正在此时一道闪电闪过，就在我面前一英尺的地方闪现出一张痛苦扭曲着的人脸来，那人是吊在树枝上的！　就是说，这张脸似乎是痛苦地扭曲着，实际上并没有动。　看上去可真让人毛骨悚然。紧接着打了一个震耳欲聋的大惊雷，仿佛天翻了个个儿，瓢泼大雨滂沱而下。不管这些，我们必须得把这个人放下来，万一他还有气呢，你说是不是？此时闪电来得又快又猛，把这个地方一会儿照成了白昼，一会儿变成了黑夜。上一秒强光一照，那个吊着的人就闪现在我面前，下一秒他又被黑暗淹没，消失在黑暗之中。我跟国王说我们必须把他放下来。国王一听马上反对。","We stood there awhile, in the thick darkness and stillness, looking toward the red blur in the distance, and trying to make out the meaning of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night.Sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote; but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature, it dulled and sank again, carrying its mystery with it.We started down the hill in its direction, and the winding road plunged us at once into almost solid darkness—darkness that was packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls.We groped along down for half a mile, perhaps, that murmur growing more and more distinct all the time.The coming storm threatening more and more, with now and then a little shiver of wind, a faint show of lightning, and dull grumblings of distant thunder.I was in the lead.I ran against something—a soft heavy something which gave, slightly, to the impulse of my weight; at the same moment the lightning glared out, and within a foot of my face was the writhing face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree!That is, it seemed to be writhing, but it was not. 　It was a grewsome sight.Straightway there was an earsplitting explosion of thunder, and the bottom of heaven fell out; the rain poured down in a deluge.No matter, we must try to cut this man down, on the chance that there might be life in him yet, mustn’t we?The lightning came quick and sharp now, and the place was alternately noonday and midnight.One moment the man would be hanging before me in an intense light, and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness.I told the king we must cut him down.The king at once objected."
"“他如果是自己上吊死的，那就是情愿让他的领主来抄没家产了，因此由他去吧。　要是别人把他吊死的，也许他们有权这么做——就让他吊着吧。”","“If he hanged himself, he was willing to lose him property to his lord; so let him be.　If others hanged him, belike they had the right—let him hang.”"
"“不过——”","“But—”"
"“不过什么不过，就不要管他了。　而且还有个缘故。等闪电再来的时候——来了，看看四周。”","“But me no buts, but even leave him as he is. 　And for yet another reason.When the lightning cometh again—there, look abroad.”"
"还有两个也吊着呢，离我们还不到五十码！","Two others hanging, within fifty yards of us!"
"“人都死了，帮他们有什么用？他们也不会跟你说声谢谢。走吧——在此逗留也无益。”","“It is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk.They are past thanking you.Come—it is unprofitable to tarry here.”"
"他说的也有点道理，因此我们又往前走。　走出还不到一里地，趁着闪电的亮光我们又发现了六具吊着的尸体，这一路上可真够吓人的。那低沉的声音也不再低沉，而成了吼声，众人的吼声。此时突然有一个人从黑暗之中隐隐约约飞奔出来，后面还有个人在追赶他。他们不见了。很快这样的事情又接二连三地发生了。随即路峰突转，把我们带到了火光面前——着火的是一座大庄园，烧得几乎不剩下什么了——处处都有人在飞奔，后面的人怒气冲冲地追赶。","There was reason in what he said, so we moved on. 　Within the next mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning, and altogether it was a grisly excursion.That murmur was a murmur no longer, it was a roar; a roar of men’s voices.A man came flying by now, dimly through the darkness, and other men chasing him.They disappeared.Presently another case of the kind occurred, and then another and another.Then a sudden turn of the road brought us in sight of that fire—it was a large manorhouse, and little or nothing was left of it—and everywhere men were flying and other men raging after them in pursuit."
"我提醒国王这个地方对于外来的人来说不太安全。我们最好躲着点亮光，等情况好点再出来。我们往后退了几步，藏进了树林边上。从这个藏身之地我们看到有几个男人女人正被愤怒的人群追赶着。这种可怕的场面一直持续到快天亮。这时候，火也灭了，暴风雨也过去了，喧闹的人声和飞奔的脚步声也很快停息了，一切又回归到黑暗和寂静之中。","I warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers.We would better get away from the light, until matters should improve.We stepped back a little, and hid in the edge of the wood.From this hiding-place we saw both men and women hunted by the mob.The fearful work went on until nearly dawn.Then, the fire being out and the storm spent, the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased, and darkness and stillness reigned again."
"我们大着胆子走出树林，急忙小心离开了，尽管又困又累，我们还是继续赶路，直到走出了几英里，将这个地方远远地抛在身后才作罢。　后来我们来到一位好心的烧炭工家借宿，人家可是有什么拿什么，尽情款待。一个女人已经起床忙活了，不过那男人还在睡觉，睡在泥地上铺着的稻草上。　那个女人似乎有点紧张，直到我跟她解释说我们是旅客，迷了路，在森林里转悠了一整夜。很快她的话就多了起来，问我们有没有听说发生在阿勃拉骚尔庄园的可怕的事。不错，我们是听说了，可现在我们最需要的是休息和睡眠。国王突然插嘴说：","We ventured out, and hurried cautiously away; and although we were worn out and sleepy, we kept on until we had put this place some miles behind us. 　Then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal burner, and got what was to be had.A woman was up and about, but the man was still asleep, on a straw shake-down, on the clay floor.The woman seemed uneasy until I explained that we were travelers and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night.She became talkative, then, and asked if we had heard of the terrible goings-on at the manor-house of Abblasoure.Yes, we had heard of them, but what we wanted now was rest and sleep.The king broke in:"
"“把房子卖与我们，你们赶紧离开吧，因为我们刚刚从死于痘疹的人家来，接触我们很危险。”","“Sell us the house and take yourselves away, for we be perilous company, being late come from people that died of the Spotted Death.”"
"他倒是一片好心，可是没有必要。这个国家最常见的装饰就是蛋奶烘烤模子般的脸了。我早就注意到了，这个女人和她丈夫就顶着这样的装饰。她十分热情地欢迎我们，一点也不害怕了。很显然她是被国王的提议深深打动了，因为，当然了，遇到一个像国王这样相貌打扮都很卑微的人，为了住上一夜就要把人家的房子买下来，这种事情她一辈子也难得遇上几回。她由此对我们肃然起敬，把小茅屋里能搜出来的东西都给了我们，尽量让我们舒服点。","It was good of him, but unnecessary.One of the commonest decorations of the nation was the waffleiron face.I had early noticed that the woman and her husband were both so decorated.She made us entirely welcome, and had no fears; and plainly she was immensely impressed by the king’s proposition; for, of course, it was a good deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the king’s humble appearance who was ready to buy a man’s house for the sake of a night’s lodging.It gave her a large respect for us, and she strained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make us comfortable."
"我们一直睡到大下午，起来以后饿坏了，以至于国王吃起农家饭来都是津津有味，尤其是饭菜还不够，吃起来就更香了。饭菜也没几样，只不过是洋葱、盐，还有那种全国人都吃的黑面包，是用喂马的粮食做的。那女人给我们讲述了昨晚上发生的事情。夜里，也不知是十点还是十一点，大家都上床睡觉了，庄园的房子突然着了火。街坊四邻都涌过来救火，全家人都救了出来，只除了一个人，庄园主。他不见了。大家找不到他急得发疯，有两个勇敢的自耕农在着火的房子里搜寻这位大人物，把命都丢了。不过过了一阵他还是被找到了——活人是没找到——是他的尸体。他的尸体躺在离那儿三百码的小树林里，被捆着，嘴里塞着东西，全身被捅了十几刀。","We slept till far into the afternoon, and then got up hungry enough to make cotter fare quite palatable to the king, the more particularly as it was scant in quantity.And also in variety; it consisted solely of onions, salt, and the national black breadÃmade out of horsefeed.The woman told us about the affair of the evening before.At ten or eleven at night, when everybody was in bed, the manor-house burst into flames.The country-side swarmed to the rescue, and the family were saved, with one exception, the master.He did not appear.Everybody was frantic over this loss, and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the burning house seeking that valuable personage.But after a while he was found—what was left of him—which was his corpse.It was in a copse three hundred yards away, bound, gagged, stabbed in a dozen places."
"事情到底是谁干的？杀人的嫌疑落到了邻家一个贫寒人家头上，不久前男爵曾对这家人特别严酷。对这些人的怀疑又很自然地牵扯到了他们的亲朋好友身上。有怀疑就足够了，领主大人手下那些身着制服的侍从立即开始讨伐这些人，周围的居民也纷纷加入。那个女人的丈夫也跟着那群人跑来跑去，直到天快亮了才回家。现在他又出去了，去打听大概的结果如何。就在我们说话的当儿他打听回来了。他报告的结果令人发指。有十八个人不是被吊死，就是被残杀了，还有两个自耕农和十三名犯人都葬身火海了。","Who had done this?Suspicion fell upon a humble family in the neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by the baron; and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself to their relatives and familiars.A suspicion was enough; my lord’s liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people, and were promptly joined by the community in general.The woman’s husband had been active with the mob, and had not returned home until nearly dawn.He was gone now to find out what the general result had been.While we were still talking he came back from his quest.His report was revolting enough.Eighteen persons hanged or butchered, and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire."
"“地窖中共有多少名犯人？”","“And how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults?”"
"“有十三名。”","“Thirteen.”"
"“那么他们都被烧死了吗？”","“Then every one of them was lost?”"
"“是的，全部死了。”","“Yes, all.”"
"“可是大家不是及时赶到救了那家人吗，为什么一个囚犯也没有救出来呢？”","“But the people arrived in time to save the family; how is it they could save none of the prisoners?”"
"那个男人一脸纳闷，说道：","The man looked puzzled, and said:"
"“那种时刻怎么能打开地窖呢？天啊，那样会有人逃跑的。”","“Would one unlock the vaults at such a time?Marry, some would have escaped.”"
"“那你的意思是没人去打开地窖了？”","“Then you mean that nobody DID unlock them?”"
"“不管是开着还是锁着，反正没人靠近地窖。明摆着，门都是闩上的，因此只需派人看守便可，即使有人越狱也逃不脱，必定被擒获。并没有人被抓到。”","“None went near them, either to lock or unlock.It standeth to reason that the bolts were fast; wherefore it was only needful to establish a watch, so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape, but be taken.None were taken.”"
"“虽然如此，还是有三人逃脱了，”国王说道，“尔等应四处告知，将他们追踪缉拿，因为是这几个人杀了男爵，烧毁房屋。”","“Natheless, three did escape,” said the king, “and ye will do well to publish it and set justice upon their track, for these murthered the baron and fired the house.”"
"我就知道国王会语惊四座。刚开始那会儿那个男人和他妻子对这个消息似乎很感兴趣，恨不得马上出去传播开来。随即，他们脸上忽然不由自主地流露出别的神情，开始问起问题来。我亲自回答了问题，同时密切关注回答所产生的效果。在知道这三名囚犯是谁之后，气氛明显转变了，这使我很欣慰。我们的主人还是那么急切地要出去传播消息，可是现在不过是装模作样而已，并非真心。国王没有注意到这个变化，我对此很高兴。我设法让话题围绕着昨天夜里发生的其他事情，同时注意到这些人在谈到这些话题时如释重负。","I was just expecting he would come out with that.For a moment the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience to go out and spread it; then a sudden something else betrayed itself in their faces, and they began to ask questions.I answered the questions myself, and narrowly watched the effects produced.I was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere; that our hosts’ continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only pretended and not real.The king did not notice the change, and I was glad of that.I worked the conversation around toward other details of the night’s proceedings, and noted that these people were relieved to have it take that direction."
"整个事件中最让人痛苦的莫过于亲眼看到，这个受压迫的群体为了维护同一个压迫者的利益，毫不迟疑地对和自己同一阶层的人痛下毒手。这对夫妻似乎感觉，当他们同阶层的人和他的领主发生了争执，那个倒霉蛋所在的整个阶级都应该站在主人一边，替他卖命，根本用不着问什么是非曲直，这简直太合情合理、顺理成章了。这家男人也曾出去帮忙吊死过自己的邻居，而且还干得满腔热情，然而心里也意识到没有什么能指控他们有罪，仅仅是怀疑罢了，哪里有什么能称之为证据的，可是无论是他还是他妻子似乎都没看出整件事情有什么令人反感之处。","The painful thing observable about all this business was the alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common oppressor.This man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of their own class and his lord, it was the natural and proper and rightful thing for that poor devil’s whole caste to side with the master and fight his battle for him, without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter.This man had been out helping to hang his neighbors, and had done his work with zeal, and yet was aware that there was nothing against them but a mere suspicion, with nothing back of it describable as evidence, still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything horrible about it."
"这真令人沮丧——对于一个梦想着要建立共和国的人来说。它让我想起了一千三百年之后的事情，当时我们南方的“白种穷人”一直受到周围那些奴隶主的鄙视，还常常遭受欺辱，而他们之所以落到这等田地，仅仅是因为中间横着那么个奴隶制。可是无论哪场政治运动，只要是支持和维护奴隶制的，他们都会胆怯起来，情愿站到奴隶主那边，最后还真的扛起毛瑟枪去战斗，为了那个让他们蒙受屈辱的制度避免走向灭亡而断送了性命。那段可悲的历史只有一点还不算是无可救药，那就是，暗地里那些“白种穷人”还是憎恨奴隶主的，也觉得自己这样做很可耻。这种感受并没有表现出来，不过事实是它确实存在着，只要环境适宜总会表现出来，不可轻视——实际上，这就足够了。因为这表明毕竟人在本质上还算是个人，即使外表没有表露出来。","This was depressing—to a man with the dream of a republic in his head.It reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away, when the “poor whites” of our South who were always despised and frequently insulted by the slave-lords around them, and who owed their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their midst, were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slave-lords in all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating of slavery, and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very institution which degraded them.And there was only one redeeming feature connected with that pitiful piece of history; and that was, that secretly the “poor white” did detest the slave-lord, and did feel his own shame.That feeling was not brought to the surface, but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out, under favoring circumstances, was something—in fact, it was enough; for it showed that a man is at bottom a man, after all, even if it doesn’t show on the outside."
"嗨，果不其然，这位烧炭工不过是多年以后那些南方“白种穷人”的孪生兄弟。国王很快就不耐烦了，说道：","Well, as it turned out, this charcoal burner was just the twin of the Southern “poor white” of the far future.The king presently showed impatience, and said:"
"“尔等整日在此喋喋不休，正义如何得以伸张。你们难道以为那些罪犯会在他们父亲的房子里呆着吗？他们早就逃跑了，可不会傻等你们。尔等快快派人骑马追赶才是。”","“An ye prattle here all the day, justice will miscarry.Think ye the criminals will abide in their father’s house?They are fleeing, they are not waiting.You should look to it that a party of horse be set upon their track.”"
"那个女人脸色变得苍白，虽然只是微微一变，还是能看得出来，那个男人则看上去有点慌张，有点犹疑。我说道：","The woman paled slightly, but quite perceptibly, and the man looked flustered and irresolute.I said:"
"“走吧，朋友，我会陪你走一段，告诉你我认为他们会往哪个方向走。要是他们仅仅是抵抗盐税或者其他荒诞不经之事，我定会保护他们，不让他们被捕，可是如果谁杀害了地位比他们高的人，而且还烧毁了人家的房子，那就另当别论了。”","“Come, friend, I will walk a little way with you, and explain which direction I think they would try to take.If they were merely resisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity I would try to protect them from capture; but when men murder a person of high degree and likewise burn his house, that is another matter.”"
"最后一句话是说给国王听的——为了封住他的嘴。　上了路，那个男人下定了决心，开始迈着坚定的步伐往前走，但是一点也没有急切的意思。 过了一会儿我说道：","The last remark was for the king—to quiet him.　On the road the man pulled his resolution together, and began the march with a steady gait, but there was no eagerness in it.  By and by I said:"
"“这些人是你什么人——堂兄弟？”","“What relation were these men to you—cousins?”"
"要不是有那层煤灰盖着，他的脸不知变得多白，他停下来，浑身发抖。","He turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him, and stopped, trembling."
"“啊呀，上帝，你是怎么知道的？”","“Ah, my God, how know ye that?”"
"“我原本不知道，只不过是随便猜猜。”","“I didn’t know it; it was a chance guess.”"
"“可怜的家伙们，这下可完了。他们以前也是些不错的小伙子。”","“Poor lads, they are lost.And good lads they were, too.”"
"“你当真要告发他们吗？”","“Were you actually going yonder to tell on them?”"
"他对该如何回答这句话有点拿不准；不过他还是吞吞吐吐地说：","He didn’t quite know how to take that; but he said, hesitatingly:"
"“是——的。”","“Ye-s.”"
"“那你他妈的真是个混蛋！”","“Then I think you are a damned scoundrel!”"
"这一骂让他很是开心，就跟我喊他是天使似的。","It made him as glad as if I had called him an angel."
"“老兄，把这句中听的话再说一遍！你的意思果真是说，如果我没有尽到职责，你也不会告发我吗？”","“Say the good words again, brother!for surely ye mean that ye would not betray me an I failed of my duty.”"
"“职责？没什么职责，除了要保持沉默，让那些人走掉。他们所做的事是正义的。”","“Duty?There is no duty in the matter, except the duty to keep still and let those men get away.They’ve done a righteous deed.”"
"他看上去很高兴，高兴吧，同时还带着那么点害怕。他朝着路上前后望了望，见没人来，才小心翼翼地说：","He looked pleased; pleased, and touched with apprehension at the same time.He looked up and down the road to see that no one was coming, and then said in a cautious voice:"
"“老兄，你从哪来的，敢说如此危险的话，还面无惧色？”","“From what land come you, brother, that you speak such perilous words, and seem not to be afraid?”"
"“我认为说给和我同一战线的人听，这话就不算危险了。 你不会告诉谁我说过这话吧？”","“They are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste, I take it.  You would not tell anybody I said them?”"
"“我？就是野马分尸我也不会说的。”","“I?I would be drawn asunder by wild horses first.”"
"“噢，那么，我就说说心里话吧。我不怕你去学舌告诉别人。 在我看来，昨晚那样对待那些无辜可怜的人，真是惨无人道。那个老男爵是罪有应得。若是我能说了算，管教他那样的人都落得同样的下场。”　恐惧和沮丧从那个人身上一扫而光，取而代之的是感激和一股勇敢劲儿：","“Well, then, let me say my say.I have no fears of your repeating it.  I think devil’s work has been done last night upon those innocent poor people.That old baron got only what he deserved.If I had my way, all his kind should have the same luck.”　Fear and depression vanished from the man’s manner, and gratefulness and a brave animation took their place:"
"“即使你是个奸细，你说这话是为了要陷害我，我听着也舒心，要是能再听你说这么几句，就是上断头台我也是欢欢喜喜的，就好比饿了一辈子总算吃上顿大餐。如今我也要说说心里话，你若想告发也随你。我之所以去帮忙吊死邻居，是因为若我对主人的事情不够热心，而落入别人眼里，那我自己的性命就难保了，而其他人去帮忙也都是为了这个原因。今天他死掉了，大家都拍手称快，可是在外面行走还要装出悲痛的样子，流着假心假意的眼泪，因为只有这么做才能保命。我说出来了，我终于说出来了！有生以来就这几句话说得痛快，能享得这般滋味，此生足矣。　随你把我带到哪里，即使去绞刑架，我也甘心前往。”","“Even though you be a spy, and your words a trap for my undoing, yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others like to them, I would go to the gallows happy, as having had one good feast at least in a starved life.And I will say my say now, and ye may report it if ye be so minded.I helped to hang my neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the master’s cause; the others helped for none other reason.All rejoice today that he is dead, but all do go about seemingly sorrowing, and shedding the hypocrite’s tear, for in that lies safety.I have said the words, I have said the words! the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth, and the reward of that taste is sufficient.Lead on, an ye will, be it even to the scaffold, for I am ready.”"
"就是这样，你瞧。归根结底，人终归是人。千百年的虐待与压迫不可能把人性剥离得一干二净。　谁要认为这话错了，那就是他自己错了。不错，史上最卑微下贱的人民，也不缺乏构成共和国的好材料——即使是俄罗斯人也行；也不会缺乏男子气概——即使是德国人也不例外——只要你能把它从它那懦弱多疑的内心深处逼出来，就能将古往今来所有确立的王权，所有支持王权的贵族，都推翻了，踩在脚下。我们肯定会看到这样的事情发生的，让我们满怀希望，坚信不疑吧。首先，在亚瑟王统治结束之前，先改革一下君主立宪制，之后，捣毁王权，取消贵族，让每一个贵族都去从事一门有用的手艺，建立普选制度，将整个政权交到这个国家所有的男人和女人手中。　是的，我的梦想一时半会儿还没有理由放弃。","There it was, you see.A man is a man, at bottom.Whole ages of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him. 　Whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken.Yes, there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded people that ever existed—even the Russians; plenty of manhood in them—even in the Germans—if one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it.We should see certain things yet, let us hope and believe.First, a modified monarchy, till Arthur’s days were done, then the destruction of the throne, nobility abolished, every member of it bound out to some useful trade, universal suffrage instituted, and the whole government placed in the hands of the men and women of the nation there to remain.Yes, there was no occasion to give up my dream yet a while."
"第三十一章　马可","CHAPTER 31 Marco"
"此刻我俩一路慢慢悠悠、不慌不忙地走着，边走边聊。去那个小村庄阿勃拉骚尔抓捕那些杀人犯，然后再到回家，我们要算算用多久，然后必须把这一来一回需要的时间都消磨掉。同时，我还顺带着满足了一下我的兴趣，这个兴趣自从我来到亚瑟王的国家之后就没有减弱，也没有失去新鲜感：那就是大家对待彼此的态度——人们生来就分等级，清清楚楚，明明白白，在路上偶然相逢彼此态度也有所不同。要是个剃了发的修道士，吭哧吭哧走着，僧帽耷拉在脑后，汗顺着那胖双下巴颏儿往下淌，这位烧炭工准是毕恭毕敬的；要是碰到个绅士，他就卑躬屈膝；要碰到的是小农或是有手艺的自由人，他就亲亲热热，非常健谈；而过路的如果是个恭敬谦卑的奴隶，他的鼻子就翘上了天——看都不会看一眼。唉，有些时候真想把人类全都绞死，结束这场闹剧。很快我们就碰到了意外的事。　一小群人，都是些衣不蔽体的孩子，有男有女，从树林里冲了出来，惊慌失措，尖叫不已。他们中最大的也就不过十二三岁。　他们向我们求助，可吓得精神错乱，弄得我们也搞不清到底发生了什么事。不过，我们还是一头扎进了树林里，他们急忙在前面带路，很快我们就明白出了什么乱子：他们把一个小家伙用一根树皮做的绳子吊了起来，那小家伙一阵乱蹬，狠命挣扎，差点就要上不来气死了。我们把他解了下来，把他救活了。这又是人性的体现，这些小家伙们羡慕大人的所作所为，就模仿了一下。他们假扮暴民玩，扮得太成功，结果比他们想象的要严重得多。","WE strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now, and talked.We must dispose of about the amount of time it ought to take to go to the little hamlet of Abblasoure and put justice on the track of those murderers and get back home again.And meantime I had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet, never lost its novelty for me since I had been in Arthur’s kingdom: the behavior—born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste—of chance passers-by toward each other.Toward the shaven monk who trudged along with his cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his fat jowls, the coal-burner was deeply reverent; to the gentleman he was abject; with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was cordial and gossipy; and when a slave passed by with a countenance respectfully lowered, this chap’s nose was in the air—he couldn’t even see him.Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.Presently we struck an incident.A small mob of half-naked boys and girls came tearing out of the woods, scared and shrieking.The eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years old. 　They implored help, but they were so beside themselves that we couldn’t make out what the matter was.However, we plunged into the wood, they skurrying in the lead, and the trouble was quickly revealed: they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope, and he was kicking and struggling, in the process of choking to death.We rescued him, and fetched him around.It was some more human nature; the admiring little folk imitating their elders; they were playing mob, and had achieved a success which promised to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for."
"走这一趟对我来说还不算乏味。我想法设法把时间消磨得很不错。我认识了形形色色的人，又借着是个外来的，想问多少问题就问多少。作为一位政治家，我自然就对工资问题比较感兴趣。整个下午我尽力搜集了许多这样的信息。缺乏经验的人，同时也不爱动脑子，往往会只根据一般的工资标准来判断那个国家是否繁荣：如果工资高，这个国家就繁荣；如果低，就不繁荣。这是错误的。重要的不是你能拿到多少钱，而是你能用这些钱买多少东西，这才是关键所在，也正是这点才能说明你的工资是真高还是只是名义上很高。我还记得十九世纪我们伟大的内战时期的情形。在北方，一个木匠一天能赚三元，是金币；在南方他能赚五十元——是用南部联盟那种纸币支付的，一蒲式耳才值一美元。在北方一套工装卖三元——相当于一天的工资；在南方卖七十五元——相当于两天的工资。其他东西也以此类推。结果，北方的工资相当于南方的两倍高，因为前者的购买力比后者的高出那么多。","It was not a dull excursion for me.I managed to put in the time very well.I made various acquaintanceships, and in my quality of stranger was able to ask as many questions as I wanted to.A thing which naturally interested me, as a statesman, was the matter of wages.I picked up what I could under that head during the afternoon.A man who hasn’t had much experience, and doesn’t think, is apt to measure a nation’s prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of the prevailing wages; if the wages be high, the nation is prosperous; if low, it isn’t.Which is an error.It isn’t what sum you get, it’s how much you can buy with it, that’s the important thing; and it’s that that tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name.I could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century.In the North a carpenter got three dollars a day, gold valuation; in the South he got fifty—payable in Confederate shinplasters worth a dollar a bushel.In the North a suit of overalls cost three dollars—a day’s wages; in the South it cost seventyfive—which was two days’ wages.Other things were in proportion.Consequently, wages were twice as high in the North as they were in the South, because the one wage had that much more purchasing power than the other had."
"不错，我在这个小村庄认识了形形色色的人，而且，还有一件事让我很得意，那就是发现我们的新硬币流通起来了——那么多密尔雷，那么多密尔，那么多分币，还有很多镍币，一些银币；所有的这些货币都在工匠和平民百姓中流通开来了。不错，就连金币都有——不过是在银行里，也就是金店那里。我去的时候正赶上马可的儿子，也叫马可，正为了四分之一磅的盐和店主讨价还价，而我要兑换一枚二十元的金币。他们倒是给换了——就是说，他们先咬了咬这枚金币，然后在柜台上摔了摔，听听声音，又弄上点酸试试成色，接着又问我从哪儿弄的，我是谁，来自哪里，要去何方，估计什么时候能到，还有许多别的问题，大概能有几百个。他们都问完了，我还继续说着，主动给他们提供了许多信息：我告诉他们我养了一条狗，名叫沃奇；我的第一任妻子是自由浸礼会信徒，她祖父是禁酒党会员；我认识一个人，他每只手都有两个大拇指，上嘴唇里面还长了个痦子，他临死前还盼望自己能光荣复活，如此这般，等等等等，直到即使那么爱打听事的村民都听够了，甚至还有点恼了。不过他对我这么财力雄厚的人还不得不尊敬点，因此才没跟我顶嘴，可是我看到他拿手底下的人撒气了，这也非常正常。是的，他们是把我那二十元的金币给兑换了，可是我断定这样一来银行就有点吃紧了，这也在意料之中，因为这就好像在十九世纪突然闯到一个乡村小店，让老板给你破一张两千元面额的钞票一样。他也许能破开，可是同时他也会奇怪一个小农民兜里怎么会带那么多钱，这也许正是这位金匠心里所想，因为他一直跟我到门口，站在那里等着我走远，满脸又是尊敬又是羡慕。","Yes, I made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation—lots of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels, and some silver; all this among the artisans and commonalty generally; yes, and even some gold—but that was at the bank, that is to say, the goldsmith’s.I dropped in there while Marco, the son of Marco, was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt, and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold piece.They furnished it—that is, after they had chewed the piece, and rung it on the counter, and tried acid on it, and asked me where I got it, and who I was, and where I was from, and where I was going to, and when I expected to get there, and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions; and when they got aground, I went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily; told them I owned a dog, and his name was Watch, and my first wife was a Free Will Baptist, and her grandfather was a Prohibitionist, and I used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection, and so on, and so on, and so on, till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied, and also a shade put out; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength, and so he didn’t give me any lip, but I noticed he took it out of his underlings, which was a perfectly natural thing to do.Yes, they changed my twenty, but I judged it strained the bank a little, which was a thing to be expected, for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two thousand-dollar bill for you all of a sudden.He could do it, maybe; but at the same time he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket; which was probably this goldsmith’s thought, too; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration."
"我们的新币不光在大量流通，它那套语言也已经被熟练应用了。也就是说，人们不再使用以前那套货币的名称，现在说起什么东西来都是值多少多少元，多少多少分，或者多少密尔，多少密尔雷。这真让人高兴。我们正在取得进展，这点可以肯定。　","Our new money was not only handsomely circulating, but its language was already glibly in use; that is to say, people had dropped the names of the former moneys, and spoke of things as being worth so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now.It was very gratifying.We were progressing, that was sure."
"我认识了几个技艺高超的工匠，不过其中最有趣的家伙当属铁匠道利。他这家伙生龙活虎，快人快语，手下有两个帮工，三个学徒，生意做得红红火火。事实上，他正大把大把地挣钱，也很受人尊敬。马可有这样的人做朋友，很是得意。他带我去那儿，表面上是让我看看那家买了他那么多炭的大商铺，实际上却是让我瞧瞧他和这位大人物交往时多么随随便便，熟不拘礼。道利和我一见如故，在科尔特兵工厂时在我手下也曾有几个精挑细选的出色的家伙。我一定要多跟他见几次面，因此我邀请他周日到马可家与我们一起用餐。　马可吓了一跳，大气都不敢喘，而当这位显贵接受了邀请时，他感激涕零，几乎忘了对这份屈尊大惊小怪了。","I got to know several master mechanics, but about the most interesting fellow among them was the blacksmith, Dowley.He was a live man and a brisk talker, and had two journeymen and three apprentices, and was doing a raging business.In fact, he was getting rich, hand over fist, and was vastly respected.Marco was very proud of having such a man for a friend.He had taken me there ostensibly to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his charcoal, but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar terms he was on with this great man.Dowley and I fraternized at once; I had had just such picked men, splendid fellows, under me in the Colt Arms Factory.I was bound to see more of him, so I invited him to come out to Marco’s Sunday, and dine with us. 　Marco was appalled, and held his breath; and when the grandee accepted, he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished at the condescension."
"马可乐得手舞足蹈——不过，只高兴了一会儿，很快他就陷入了沉思，随即愁眉不展。而当他听我告诉道利说还要请石匠头子狄肯和车匠头子斯马格也一同前往，他脸上的煤灰就变成了惨白色，控制不住自己了。不过我知道他是怎么回事，是因为开销问题。他觉得自己要破产了，他判断自己还有钱的日子屈指可数了。但是，在去邀请其他人的路上，我说道：","Marco’s joy was exuberant—but only for a moment; then he grew thoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell Dowley I should have Dickon, the boss mason, and Smug, the boss wheelwright, out there, too, the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk, and he lost his grip.But I knew what was the matter with him; it was the expense.He saw ruin before him; he judged that his financial days were numbered.However, on our way to invite the others, I said:"
"“你一定要让我请这几位朋友来，而且你还得让我来出钱。”","“You must allow me to have these friends come; and you must also allow me to pay the costs.”"
"他脸上乌云一扫而光，说话也有精神了：","His face cleared, and he said with spirit:"
"“不过钱不能全让你出，不能全让你出。你一个人也负担不了这么多钱。”","“But not all of it, not all of it.Ye cannot well bear a burden like to this alone.”"
"我拦住了他，说道：","I stopped him, and said:"
"“现在让我们彼此了解一下吧，老朋友。不错，我只是个农庄上管事的，但是，不管怎么说，还不算太穷。今年我可是走了运了——你要听说我是怎样发家的，一定会吓一大跳。我跟你说实话吧，就这样的酒席，我可以一挥霍就摆上十几桌，而不用去在乎什么开销！”说着，我还打了个响指。我能看到自己在马可心目中一尺一尺地增高了，而当我说出最后那几句话时我整个儿变成了一座高塔了。“所以你瞧，你一定要听我的。　这次宴请你不用出一分钱，就这么定了。”","“Now let’s understand each other on the spot, old friend.I am only a farm bailiff, it is true; but I am not poor, nevertheless.I have been very fortunate this year—you would be astonished to know how I have thriven.I tell you the honest truth when I say I could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care THAT for the expense!” and I snapped my fingers.I could see myself rise a foot at a time in Marco’s estimation, and when I fetched out those last words I was become a very tower for style and altitude.“So you see, you must let me have my way. 　You can’t contribute a cent to this orgy, that’s SETTLED.”"
"“您如此大方体恤——”","“It’s grand and good of you—”"
"“哪里哪里。你也曾慷慨无比，敞开大门招待我和琼斯，琼斯今天还跟我提这话来着，就在你刚从村里回来之前。尽管他不大可能亲自跟你说这话——因为琼斯不是个爱说话的人，有点腼腆怕人——他心地不坏，知道感恩，别人待他好他也懂得感激。不错，你和你妻子都曾热情款待我俩——”","“No, it isn’t.You’ve opened your house to Jones and me in the most generous way; Jones was remarking upon it to-day, just before you came back from the village; for although he wouldn’t be likely to say such a thing to you—because Jones isn’t a talker, and is diffident in society—he has a good heart and a grateful, and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated; yes, you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us—”"
"“啊呀，老兄，这不值一提——这哪是款待！”","“Ah, brother, ’tis nothing—SUCH hospitality!”"
"“可是这很值得一提；一个人把他最好的东西，不计回报，给了别人，这怎能说是不值一提，即使是君主之流也莫过于此——因为即使是君主也只能尽力而为了。因此现在咱们就四处采办东西，把酒席准备好，你就不要再担心开销问题了。我可是古今少有的挥霍高手呢。喂，你知道不，有时仅仅一个星期我就花了——不过别管这个了——反正你也不会相信的。”","“But it IS something; the best a man has, freely given, is always something, and is as good as a prince can do, and ranks right along beside it—for even a prince can but do his best.And so we’ll shop around and get up this layout now, and don’t you worry about the expense.I’m one of the worst spendthrifts that ever was born.Why, do you know, sometimes in a single week I spend—but never mind about that—you’d never believe it anyway.”"
"于是我们就继续溜溜达达往前走，这家停停那家看看，讲讲价钱，跟店主们聊聊昨晚的暴乱，时不时还能碰到几个可怜的孩子，更让人想起那茬事来，人人都躲着他们，眼泪汪汪，无家可归，家都让人抄没了，父母不是被残杀就是被吊死了。马可两口子身上的衣服，一件是粗麻布的，一件是麻毛混纺的，都跟城镇地图似的，上面全是补丁，五六年来，一块摞一块，添一个小镇又一个小镇，直到衣服原来的样子只能露出巴掌大的一块了。如今因为要有贵客临门，所以我就想给他俩添置两套新衣服，不过不知道该怎么着手办——办妥贴点，到后来我突然想到，刚才我已经编了篇谎话，替国王感谢他两口子了，现在正好再用点实实在在的东西来证明一下，于是我就说道：","And so we went gadding along, dropping in here and there, pricing things, and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot, and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it, in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged.The raiment of Marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and linsey-woolsey respectively, and resembled township maps, it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added, township by township, in the course of five or six years, until hardly a hand’s-breadth of the original garments was surviving and present.Now I wanted to fit these people out with new suits, on account of that swell company, and I didn’t know just how to get at it—with delicacy, until at last it struck me that as I had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king, it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort; so I said:"
"“马可呀，还有一件事你也得答应我——是为了琼斯——因为我知道你不想得罪他。他急于找到一个方法来证明一下他的感激之情，可是又太羞怯了，自己不敢冒昧去做，因此他求我代他买点东西给你和你夫人菲利斯，他来付钱，还不能让你们知道是他送的——你也明白一个脸皮薄的人在这种事情上的感受——因此我就说就这么办吧，咱俩谁也别说出去。　嗯，他的意思是给你们两口子各置一套新衣服——”","“And Marco, there’s another thing which you must permit—out of kindness for Jones—because you wouldn’t want to offend him.He was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way, but he is so diffident he couldn’t venture it himself, and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and Dame Phyllis and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him—you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing—and so I said I would, and we would keep mum. 　Well, his idea was, a new outfit of clothes for you both—”"
"“啊呀，那太浪费了！这可不行，老兄，这可不行。想想这得花多少钱——”","“Oh, it is wastefulness!It may not be, brother, it may not be.Consider the vastness of the sum—”"
"“去他妈的多少钱！安静一会儿，看能把你怎么样，简直让人插不上话，你的话也太多了。马可，你真该改改这毛病。这样不好，你也明白，而且如果你不改正就会越来越严重。对了，现在咱俩进这家问问价钱吧——千万别忘了，不要在琼斯面前说漏了嘴，说你知道这事儿跟他有什么关系。你想不到，他这人敏感到让人奇怪，还心高气傲。　他是个农场主——家境颇为不错的农场主——而我是他的管家，可是——那家伙太能胡思乱想了！　唉，有时他忘乎所以吹起牛来，你会以为他是世上什么了不起的人物呢。你听他说上一百年也不会把他当成个农场主的——尤其是当他谈起种地的时候。他以为自己是农场主里的阎罗王，以为自己是老资格里的老资格；可是，也就咱俩私下里说说，他对于种地的了解还不如对于如何治理国家懂得的多呢——虽然如此，不管他说什么，你都得张大嘴巴听着，就好像你有生以来从没听过这么不可思议的至理名言，而且还生怕自己还没听够就一命呜乎了。这样就能取悦琼斯了。”","“Hang the vastness of the sum!Try to keep quiet for a moment, and see how it would seem; a body can’t get in a word edgeways, you talk so much.You ought to cure that, Marco; it isn’t good form, you know, and it will grow on you if you don’t check it.Yes, we’ll step in here now and price this man’s stuff—and don’t forget to remember to not let on to Jones that you know he had anything to do with it.You can’t think how curiously sensitive and proud he is. 　He’s a farmer—pretty fairly well-to-do farmer—an I’m his bailiff; BUT—the imagination of that man!Why, sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off, you’d think he was one of the swells of the earth; and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer—especially if he talked agriculture.He THINKS he’s a Sheol of a farmer; thinks he’s old Grayback from Wayback; but between you and me privately he don’t know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdom—still, whatever he talks about, you want to drop your underjaw and listen, the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before, and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it.That will please Jones.”"
"听到有这么古怪的性格，可把马可打心底里逗乐了，不过我这么说是为了给他打剂预防针。根据我的经验，和国王一起出行，他虽然装成不是国王的样子，可是有一大半时间都记不住这事，那你可得小心了，怎么小心也不为过。","It tickled Marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character; but it also prepared him for accidents; and in my experience when you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and can’t remember it more than about half the time, you can’t take too many precautions."
"这是迄今为止我俩到过的最好的铺子了，里面什么都有，虽然数量不多，从砧板到布匹，一直到鱼和假珠宝。我断定在这儿能把所要的东西全都买齐，就不用再四处打听价钱了。因此我把马可支开，派他去邀请石匠和车匠，好给我腾出地儿来大施拳脚。因为我这人办事不喜欢不声不响的，必须要热热闹闹的，要不然我就觉得趣味索然。我漫不经心地把一大把钱都显摆了出来，好骗得店主对我的尊敬，接着我把想买的东西列了张清单，递给店主看看他能否看懂。他看得懂，还很得意地向人展示他能看懂。他说曾有一位神父教过他，所以他读书写字都行。他从头看到尾，很满意，说这个单子列出的东西可真不少。嗯，确实不少，对于他那么个小买卖来说。我不仅要置办一场盛宴，还要额外买点零碎东西。我吩咐他用车把货装好送到马可的儿子，名字也叫马可的人家，周六晚上之前送到，周日午饭时把帐单给我。他说请我放心，他保证及时送到，毫无差错，这是他店里的规矩。他还提出说要额外免费赠送马可家两支钱枪——如今人人都在用。他对这个精巧玩意儿赞不绝口。我说：","This was the best store we had come across yet; it had everything in it, in small quantities, from anvils and drygoods all the way down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry.I concluded I would bunch my whole invoice right here, and not go pricing around any more.So I got rid of Marco, by sending him off to invite the mason and the wheelwright, which left the field free to me.For I never care to do a thing in a quiet way; it’s got to be theatrical or I don’t take any interest in it.I showed up money enough, in a careless way, to corral the shopkeeper’s respect, and then I wrote down a list of the things I wanted, and handed it to him to see if he could read it.He could, and was proud to show that he could.He said he had been educated by a priest, and could both read and write.He ran it through, and remarked with satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy bill.Well, and so it was, for a little concern like that.I was not only providing a swell dinner, but some odds and ends of extras.I ordered that the things be carted out and delivered at the dwelling of Marco, the son of Marco, by Saturday evening, and send me the bill at dinner-time Sunday.He said I could depend upon his promptness and exactitude, it was the rule of the house.He also observed that he would throw in a couple of miller-guns for the Marcos gratis—that everybody was using them now. He had a mighty opinion of that clever device.I said:"
"“还请你把它们装上，装一半，这也记到我帐上。”","“And please fill them up to the middle mark, too; and add that to the bill.”"
"他答应了，乐意之极。他装上后我带走了。　我没敢告诉他，钱枪是我自己的一个小小发明，而且是我正式下令本国所有的店主都要备这种货，并且按官价出售——那价钱跟白送差不多，卖的钱归店主所有，国家分文不取。我们对此是无偿供应。","He would, with pleasure.He filled them, and I took them with me. 　I couldn’t venture to tell him that the miller-gun was a little invention of my own, and that I had officially ordered that every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them at government price—which was the merest trifle, and the shopkeeper got that, not the government.We furnished them for nothing."
"天黑时我们才回去，国王根本就没怎么想我们。他早早就掉进自己的梦境中，梦到举全国之力大肆进攻高卢国，一下午的时间就这样不知不觉地溜走了，他一次也没回过神来。","The king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall.He had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of Gaul with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back, and the afternoon had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again."
"第三十二章　道利丢脸","CHAPTER 32 Dowley’s Humiliation"
"周六下午太阳快落山时货物送到了，我好一顿忙活才没让马可一家吓晕过去。他们断定我和琼斯这下可是倾家荡产，没救了，他们还责怪自己对这次破产推波助澜。你瞧，准备酒席的材料要花的钱已经是数目相当可观了，可除此之外我还额外买了许多东西，好让这个家庭将来的生活能舒服点：比如说，我买了一大堆麦子，因为对于他们这个阶层，小麦就是珍馐美味，很少出现在饭桌上，就好比一个隐士也很少能见到冰淇淋一样；我又买了一张大松木饭桌；另外我还买了整整两磅盐，在他们眼里，这又是挥霍无度了；此外还有些坛坛罐罐、工具、衣服，一小桶啤酒，等等等等。我吩咐马可两口子不要把这个大排场声张出去，好给我个机会来让那些客人大吃一惊，显摆一下。说起那些新衣服，心地单纯的两口子就跟小孩子似的。他们一整夜躺下又起来，来回折腾，看看天是不是快亮了，好让他们穿上新衣服，结果还有一个钟头天才亮，他们就把新衣服穿上了。　那时他们的快乐——姑且不要称之为发神经了——看起来是如此新颖别致，虽然我被折腾得一夜没睡好，也是非常值得的了。国王睡得还和以往一样——跟死人似的。马可一家不能为了那些衣服向国王道谢，因为我不让那么做。不过他们还是想尽一切办法来让国王明白他们有多感激。结果是白费力气：国王根本没察觉有什么不一样的地方。　","WELL, when that cargo arrived toward sunset, Saturday afternoon, I had my hands full to keep the Marcos from fainting.They were sure Jones and I were ruined past help, and they blamed themselves as accessories to this bankruptcy.You see, in addition to the dinner-materials, which called for a sufficiently round sum, I had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family: for instance, a big lot of wheat, a delicacy as rare to the tables of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit’s; also a sizeable deal dinner-table; also two entire pounds of salt, which was another piece of extravagance in those people’s eyes; also crockery, stools, the clothes, a small cask of beer, and so on.I instructed the Marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to give me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little.Concerning the new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they were up and down, all night, to see if it wasn’t nearly daylight, so that they could put them on, and they were into them at last as much as an hour before dawn was due. 　Then their pleasure—not to say delirium—was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered.The king had slept just as usual—like the dead.The Marcos could not thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden; but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were.Which all went for nothing: he didn’t notice any change."
"那天正赶上少见的好天气，虽然在秋季，却像六月天，不过没那么热，刚好适合户外活动，如在天堂一般。快到中午时客人都到了，我们聚在一棵大树下，不一会儿就有说有笑，一见如故了。就连国王也不那么矜持了，虽然刚开始时别人喊他琼斯他还有点转不过弯来，还费点劲。我早就要他使劲记着点，别忘了自己是个农场主，可是为了谨慎起见，我又让他点到为止，千万别做过火了。　因为他这种人，你要是不提醒他，他准能把小事都给你搞砸了，这点你不用怀疑，他的舌头那么灵巧，精神上那么积极，他的信息又那么靠不住。","It turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is just a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors.Toward noon the guests arrived, and we assembled under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances.Even the king’s reserve melted a little, though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at first.I had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer; but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that, and not elaborate it any. 　Because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you didn’t warn him, his tongue was so handy, and his spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain."
"道利可算是露了脸了，我老早就叫他开了言，接着又巧妙地用话勾他，让他长篇大论讲开了自己的历史，把自己讲成个大英雄，这时我们就可以坐在那里，听他哼哼哈哈，感觉真好。　他这人是白手起家的，你知道。这种人最能说会道了。不错，他们比其他类型的人更值得赞扬，真的；而且他们也是最先发现这点的。　他讲到当年他无父无母，身无分文，也没有朋友可依靠，就这样开始闯生活；讲到自己如何在最吝啬的主人手下过着奴隶般的生活；讲到他一天要干十六个甚至十八个小时，挣的钱只够买黑面包，还只能吃个半饱；讲到他如何靠锲而不舍的努力最终吸引了一位好心铁匠的注意，突然主动提出要收他为徒，为期九年，管吃管穿，还教给他手艺——或者说“奥秘”，按照道利的说法；这片好心完全出乎他的意料，差点把他激动死。那是他头一次飞黄腾达，头一次鸿运当头。你瞧，他现在说起来，还是滔滔不绝，又惊又喜，这样金光闪闪的提拔机会竟然落到他这样一个普通人身上。在学徒期间他没有穿过一件新衣服，可是出徒那天他的师傅用粗麻布作成的崭新的衣服把他包裹了起来，他感到说不出的阔气，说不出的好看。","Dowley was in fine feather, and I early got him started, and then adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and himself for a hero, and then it was good to sit there and hear him hum. 　Self-made man, you know.They know how to talk.They do deserve more credit than any other breed of men, yes, that is true; and they are among the very first to find it out, too. 　He told how he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends able to help him; how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest master lived; how his day’s work was from sixteen to eighteen hours long, and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a half-fed condition; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted the attention of a good blacksmith, who came near knocking him dead with kindness by suddenly offering, when he was totally unprepared, to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade—or “mystery” as Dowley called it.That was his first great rise, his first gorgeous stroke of fortune; and you saw that he couldn’t yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human being.He got no new clothing during his apprenticeship, but on his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang-new tow-linens and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine."
"“那天我还记得！”车匠激动地喊道。","“I remember me of that day!” the wheelwright sang out, with enthusiasm."
"“我也同样记得！”石匠也喊道，“我简直不敢相信那是你自己的衣服，其实我确实也不相信。”","“And I likewise!” cried the mason.“I would not believe they were thine own; in faith I could not.”"
"“谁能相信呢！”道利大喊道，两眼闪着光芒，“我险些坏了自己的名声，左邻右舍都以为我许是偷来的哩。那天真是个大日子，大日子，这样的日子叫人终身难忘。”","“Nor other!” shouted Dowley, with sparkling eyes.“I was like to lose my character, the neighbors wending I had mayhap been stealing.It was a great day, a great day; one forgetteth not days like that.”"
"不错，而且他的师傅人不错，家境殷实，一年中总要大摆两次宴席，大块吃肉，而且还有白面包吃，真正的小麦面包。说真的，过的是贵族般的日子，可以这么说。后来道利娶了铁匠的女儿，继承了他的买卖。","Yes, and his master was a fine man, and prosperous, and always had a great feast of meat twice in the year, and with it white bread, true wheaten bread; in fact, lived like a lord, so to speak.And in time Dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter."
"“再想想如今的光景，”道利神采飞扬地说道，“每月两次，饭桌上都有鲜肉吃。”　他说道这儿顿了一下，好让大家细细品味一下，然后又加了半句——“还要吃八回腌肉。”","“And now consider what is come to pass,” said he, impressively.“Two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table.” He made a pause here, to let that fact sink home, then added—“and eight times salt meat.”"
"“这话不假。”车匠屏息静气地说道。","“It is even true,” said the wheelwright, with bated breath."
"“据我所知也是如此。”石匠也说道，也是一副恭恭敬敬的态度。","“I know it of mine own knowledge,” said the mason, in the same reverent fashion."
"“一年之中每到礼拜日我家饭桌上都有白面包。”铁匠师傅一本正经地加了一句，“各位朋友，凭良心说，这可是实情？”","“On my table appeareth white bread every Sunday in the year,” added the master smith, with solemnity.“I leave it to your own consciences, friends, if this is not also true?”"
"“我以颈上人头发誓，是的。”石匠喊道。","“By my head, yes,” cried the mason."
"“我可以作证——我也乐意作证。”车匠说道。","“I can testify it—and I do,” said the wheelwright."
"“至于家具，你们自己说说我到底有多少家伙。”　　他把手一挥，做了个漂亮的手势，意思是让大家实话实说，畅所欲言，而且还加了一句：　“心里想啥就说啥，有话就说，就当我不在场。”","“And as to furniture, ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment is. ” 　He waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and unhampered freedom of speech, and added: 　“Speak as ye are moved; speak as ye would speak; an I were not here.”"
"“虽然你家只有三口人，可凳子就有五条，还都是做工最精良的。”车匠说道，一脸敬意。","“Ye have five stools, and of the sweetest workmanship at that, albeit your family is but three,” said the wheelwright, with deep respect."
"“还有六只木制高脚杯，六只大木盘子，两只锡盘，皆供饮食之用。”石匠眉飞色舞地说，“而且我说这话，皆因知道人终有一死，无论所言是虚是实，待到世界末日都要接受上帝的审判。”","“And six wooden goblets, and six platters of wood and two of pewter to eat and drink from withal,” said the mason, impressively.“And I say it as knowing God is my judge, and we tarry not here alway, but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body, be they false or be they sooth.”"
"“琼斯老兄，如今你可明白我是何许人了吧，”铁匠道利说道，一副和颜悦色，降贵屈尊的样子，“不消得怀疑，你定会以为我是个特别看重别人尊敬的人，见到生人不弄准对方的身份地位断不会倾心相付，可是对于这点你大可不必担心；你若细细观察便可得知，我这人对于事情从不放在心上，只要这人心地善良，无论家产如何微薄，我都乐意平等相待，兄弟相称。我可以与你握手为证；我亲口所言，咱俩平起平坐——平起平坐”——他面带微笑环顾众人，志满意得，就好像他就是上帝，正在施舍恩惠，自己心里还很清楚这点似的。","“Now ye know what manner of man I am, brother Jones,” said the smith, with a fine and friendly condescension, “and doubtless ye would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and but sparing of outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be assured, but trouble yourself not, as concerning that; wit ye well ye shall find me a man that regardeth not these matters but is willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that carrieth a right heart in his body, be his worldly estate howsoever modest.And in token of it, here is my hand; and I say with my own mouth we are equals—equals ”—and he smiled around on the company with the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious thing and is quite well aware of it."
"国王接过这只手来，那份勉勉强强的神气怎么也掩盖不住，而且很乐于丢开它，就跟一位淑女丢掉手里的活鱼一样。这一切效果还不错，因为大家误以为他是因为受了大人物的垂青，所以很自然地感到窘迫不安呢。","The king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance, and let go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish; all of which had a good effect, for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural to one who was being called upon by greatness."
"此时女主人把那张桌子搬了出来，摆在树下。这桌子马上就引起了一阵明显的骚动，人人都很吃惊，桌子崭新崭新的，还是松木的，十分奢华。女主人慢慢展开一块切切实实、地地道道的桌布，并把它铺开来，浑身每个毛孔都透着股满不在乎的劲儿，可是眼里却燃烧着虚荣的火焰，把一切都暴露无遗，这下子人们可就比刚才更加吃惊了。这可比铁匠家的排场更胜一筹了，让铁匠大受打击，你能看出来这点。然而马可却是如在天堂，这点你也能看出来。随后女主人又拿出来两条漂亮的新凳子——哟！那可真是举座皆惊，你能从每个客人的眼神里看出来。接着她又搬出两条——尽量装作很淡定。又引起了轰动——还夹杂着惊叹的交谈。她又搬出两条来——她仿佛走在云端，得意洋洋。客人们都惊呆了，石匠嘀咕道：","The dame brought out the table now, and set it under the tree.It caused a visible stir of surprise, it being brand new and a sumptuous article of deal.But the surprise rose higher still when the dame, with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore, but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity, slowly unfolded an actual simon-pure tablecloth and spread it.That was a notch above even the blacksmith’s domestic grandeurs, and it hit him hard; you could see it.But Marco was in Paradise; you could see that, too. 　Then the dame brought two fine new stools—whew!that was a sensation; it was visible in the eyes of every guest.Then she brought two more—as calmly as she could.Sensation again—with awed murmurs.Again she brought two—walking on air, she was so proud.The guests were petrified, and the mason muttered:"
"“世间竟有这等排场，怎能让人不五体投地。”","“There is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence.”"
"就在女主人转身要离开时，马可忍不住想要趁热打铁，把场面推向高潮。因此他就发话了，虽然想做出慢悠悠的样子，可惜不太像：","As the dame turned away, Marco couldn’t help slapping on the climax while the thing was hot; so he said with what was meant for a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it:"
"“这些就够了，其余的就不用拿出来了。”","“These suffice; leave the rest.”"
"那就是还有更多呢！　这手太漂亮了。就是我亲自来演，也不能做得更好了。","So there were more yet!It was a fine effect.I couldn’t have played the hand better myself."
"在此之上，女主人又以迅雷不及掩耳之势将大家的惊奇推向了新的高峰，大家虽然在阴凉里，那份惊奇却被烧到了一百五十度，同时表情也呆滞了，只能倒抽着气在那儿“噢”“啊”地叫唤，张着手，抬着眼，话都说不出来了。她拿来了陶器——新的，还不少；拿来的还有新木制高脚杯，以及其他桌上用品；还有啤酒，鱼，嫩鸡，一只鹅，鸡蛋，烤牛肉，烤羊肉，一只火腿，一只烤乳猪，和一大堆货真价实的白小麦面包。总而言之，面对着这桌酒席，那些人以前见过的一切都黯然失色。他们坐在那儿，傻呆呆的，又是惊诧又是敬畏，就在这个当口，我貌似无心地一挥手，商店老板的儿子就从天而降，说他来收帐来了。","From this out, the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the shade, and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to gasped “Oh’s” and “Ah’s,” and mute upliftings of hands and eyes.She fetched crockery—new, and plenty of it; new wooden goblets and other table furniture; and beer, fish, chicken, a goose, eggs, roast beef, roast mutton, a ham, a small roast pig, and a wealth of genuine white wheaten bread.Take it by and large, that spread laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before.And while they sat there just simply stupefied with wonder and awe, I sort of waved my hand as if by accident, and the storekeeper’s son emerged from space and said he had come to collect."
"“好吧，”我漫不经心地说，“多少钱？一样一样报给我们听听。”","“That’s all right,” I said, indifferently.“What is the amount?Give us the items.”"
"随后他就把帐单读了一遍，那三个人吃惊地听着，而我心头则涌起了得意之情，马可则是一会儿害怕，一会儿羡慕：","Then he read off this bill, while those three amazed men listened, and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate waves of terror and admiration surged over Marco’s:"

"他停了下来。全场静悄悄的，静得吓人。连动动胳膊腿儿的人都没有。连出长气的鼻孔都没有一只。","He ceased.There was a pale and awful silence.Not a limb stirred.Not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath."
"“就这些吗？”我问道，声音平静得不得了。","“Is that all?” I asked, in a voice of the most perfect calmness."
"“就这些了，尊敬的先生，那些无足轻重的东西也都列入杂项一栏了。若您嫌不够细，我会分——”","“All, fair sir, save that certain matters of light moment are placed together under a head hight sundries.If it would like you, I will sepa—”"
"“没有关系，”我边说边做了个压根就不在乎的手势，“请给我个总数。”","“It is of no consequence,” I said, accompanying the words with a gesture of the most utter indifference; “give me the grand total, please.”"
"那个伙计斜靠在一棵树上稳住了自己，才说道：","The clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself, and said:"
"“三万九千一百五十密尔雷！”","“Thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays!”"
"车匠从凳子上摔了下来，其他人也纷纷抓住桌子免得摔倒，大家压低嗓门纷纷感叹道：","The wheelwright fell off his stool, the others grabbed the table to save themselves, and there was a deep and general ejaculation of:"
"“灾祸降临，老天保佑！”","“God be with us in the day of disaster!”"
"那伙计赶紧说：","The clerk hastened to say:"
"“家父嘱咐我转告您，若要您一次付清，未免不是君子所为，因此只请您——”","“My father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you to pay it all at this time, and therefore only prayeth you—”"
"我把它当作一阵耳旁风，压根就没有理会，而是摆出满不在乎甚至有点厌烦的神气，掏出钱来，抽出四元放到桌上。啊，你真该看看他们瞪大眼睛的样子！ ","I paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze, but, with an air of indifference amounting almost to weariness, got out my money and tossed four dollars on to the table.Ah, you should have seen them stare!"
"那伙计又惊又喜。他求我留下一块钱做押金，等他回到镇上去——我打断了他：","The clerk was astonished and charmed.He asked me to retain one of the dollars as security, until he could go to town and—I interrupted:"
"“什么，去取九分钱回来吗？别胡扯了！都拿走。不用找零了。”","“What, and fetch back nine cents?Nonsense! Take the whole.Keep the change.”"
"大家又惊奇地嘀咕起来，说道：","There was an amazed murmur to this effect:"
"“这人真是钱堆的吧！ 简直是挥金如土。”","“Verily this being is MADE of money!He throweth it away even as if it were dirt.”"
"那位铁匠的脸算是丢光了。","The blacksmith was a crushed man."
"那伙计接了钱，大笔财富在手，像喝醉了一样踉踉跄跄离开了。我对马可和他妻子说道：","The clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune.I said to Marco and his wife:"
"“好乡亲，略备薄礼，望笑纳”——随后把钱枪递给了他们，仿佛不当回事似的，虽然每个里面都装着十五分钱，那可是实实在在的现钱。两个可怜的家伙又是吃惊又是感激，都快承受不了了，此时我又转身对其他人发话了，语气平静得仿佛是在问时间：","“Good folk, here is a little trifle for you”—handing the miller-guns as if it were a matter of no consequence, though each of them contained fifteen cents in solid cash; and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude, I turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day:"
"“嗯，要是大家都准备好了，我觉得该开饭了。来吧，请。”","“Well, if we are all ready, I judge the dinner is. 　Come, fall to.”"
"好嘛，场面真够宏大的；嗯，这可真了不起。我从来不知道自己还能利用现有的材料把场面搞得这么精彩，能制造出如此不凡的效果。那个铁匠——唉，他简直是一败涂地。老天爷！无论如何，我也不愿尝尝他现在的滋味。方才他还在大肆吹嘘，自己一年要办两回酒席，一月吃两次鲜肉，一周吃两次腌肉，还有成年到头每逢礼拜日都要吃白面包——还只是一家三口吃；一年总共的开销也不过六十九点二六（六十九分，两密尔加六密尔雷），而突然之间来了这么一个人，只大摆一次筵席就挥霍了将近四元，不但如此，举手投足之间还流露出花这么点小钱不值得费事的神气来。嗯，道利这下可算蔫了，瘪了，垮掉了；他就好像是一个尿泡做的气球被牛踩过一般。","Ah, well, it was immense; yes, it was a daisy.I don’t know that I ever put a situation together better, or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available.The blacksmith—well, he was simply mashed.Land! I wouldn’t have felt what that man was feeling, for anything in the world.Here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand meat-feast twice a year, and his fresh meat twice a month, and his salt meat twice a week, and his white bread every Sunday the year round—all for a family of three; the entire cost for the year not above 69.2.6 (sixty-nine cents, two mills and six milrays), and all of a sudden here comes along a man who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out; and not only that, but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small sums.Yes, Dowley was a good deal wilted, and shrunk-up and collapsed; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that’s been stepped on by a cow."
"第三十三章　六世纪的政治经济学","CHAPTER 33 Sixth Century Political Economy"
"不过，我还是死盯住他不放，筵席还没进行到三分之一，我又让他高高兴兴的了。这很容易——在一个划分等级阶层的国家里。你瞧，在一个国家，要是把人们分出等级和阶层，那人就不再是人了，只是人的一部分，他永远也发育不完全。你只要能证明自己在地位、头衔或者财富上比他略胜一筹，那就行了——他就服软了。从此以后你再也羞辱不了他了。不，我的意思不是说完全羞辱不了，你当然可以羞辱他了，我只是说要费点劲。因此，除非你手上有大把空闲时间，要不然真不值得一试。如今我已经赢得了铁匠对我的尊敬，因为很显然我财力雄厚，非常富有。我要是再有个华而不实的贵族小头衔，他就能崇拜我了。不仅是铁匠，这个国家里任何一个普通老百姓都会崇拜我，尽管他在智力、价值和人品方面都是亘古少有，而我这三者一样也不占。只要英国还在地球上存在着，情况就不会改变。有了这种预言的魔力，我就可以展望未来，看到这个国家树碑立像，来纪念那些令人难以启齿的乔治们和其他顶着皇室贵族头衔的空架子们，而把那些创造了世界的人——在上帝之后——古登堡、瓦特、阿克赖特、惠特尼、摩斯、斯蒂芬森和贝尔都晾在一边。","HOWEVER, I made a dead set at him, and before the first third of the dinner was reached, I had him happy again.It was easy to do—in a country of ranks and castes.You see, in a country where they have ranks and castes, a man isn’t ever a man, he is only part of a man, he can’t ever get his full growth.You prove your superiority over him in station, or rank, or fortune, and that’s the end of it—he knuckles down.You can’t insult him after that.No, I don’t mean quite that; of course you CAN insult him, I only mean it’s difficult; and so, unless you’ve got a lot of useless time on your hands it doesn’t pay to try.　I had the smith’s reverence now, because I was apparently immensely prosperous and rich; I could have had his adoration if I had had some little gimcrack title of nobility.And not only his, but any commoner’s in the land, though he were the mightiest production of all the ages, in intellect, worth, and character, and I bankrupt in all three.This was to remain so, as long as England should exist in the earth.With the spirit of prophecy upon me, I could look into the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable Georges and other royal and noble clothes-horses, and leave unhonored the creators of this world—after God—Gutenburg, Watt, Arkwright, Whitney, Morse, Stephenson, Bell."
"国王吃了个肠满肚圆，随后，听到话题没转到征战或是身着铠甲决斗之类的话题上来，他觉得很沉闷，昏昏欲睡，躲到一边打盹去了。马可太太把桌子收拾了，把那桶啤酒放到够得着的地方，然后就躲到没人看到的角落去吃她的残羹剩饭去了，留下我们闲聊，聊着聊着话题就慢慢跑到我们关心的问题上来了——不用说，就是生意和工资了。乍一看，与我自己国家的情况相比，这个还要向别国进贡的小国家——国王名叫巴格狄马格斯——看起来是极其繁荣的。他们的“保护”机制正全面实行，而我们正在向着自由贸易的目标前进，顺顺当当，现在走了半截了。不久，就剩下道利和我在说话了，其他人都在如饥似渴地听着。道利越说越起劲，嗅到有机可乘，就开始把他认为能让我难堪的问题都抛了出来，这些问题看上去也确实如此：","The king got his cargo aboard, and then, the talk not turning upon battle, conquest, or iron-clad duel, he dulled down to drowsiness and went off to take a nap. 　Mrs. Marco cleared the table, placed the beer keg handy, and went away to eat her dinner of leavings in humble privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to the hearts of our sort—business and wages, of course.At a first glance, things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary kingdom—whose lord was King Bagdemagus—as compared with the state of things in my own region.They had the “protection” system in full force here, whereas we were working along down toward free-trade, by easy stages, and were now about half way. 　Before long, Dowley and I were doing all the talking, the others hungrily listening.Dowley warmed to his work, snuffed an advantage in the air, and began to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me, and they did have something of that look:"
"“老兄，在你们国家，能干的管事、有本事的农夫、车夫、放羊人和放猪人一天能挣多少钱？”","“In your country, brother, what is the wage of a master bailiff, master hind, carter, shepherd, swineherd?”"
"“一天二十五密尔雷；也就是说，四分之一分钱。”","“Twenty-five milrays a day; that is to say, a quarter of a cent.”"
"铁匠乐得眉开眼笑。他说道：","The smith’s face beamed with joy.He said:"
"“在我们这儿他们挣的能翻一番呢！那手艺人能挣多少——就是木匠、泥瓦匠、石匠、油漆匠、铁匠和车夫之类的人？”","“With us they are allowed the double of it!And what may a mechanic get—carpenter, dauber, mason, painter, blacksmith, wheelwright, and the like?”"
"“平均说来，五十密尔雷；一天半分钱。”","“On the average, fifty milrays; half a cent a day.”"
"“呵呵！我们这儿一天能挣一百！在我们这儿无论哪个能干的手艺人一天都能挣一分钱！　我没把裁缝算在内，不过其他都是如此——他们一天都能挣一分，赶活的时候挣的还多呢——嗯，一天能达到一百一十甚至于一百一十五密尔雷。这个星期我自己就付了一百一十五出去。保护主义万岁——叫自由贸易见鬼去吧！”","“Ho-ho!With us they are allowed a hundred!With us any good mechanic is allowed a cent a day!I count out the tailor, but not the others—they are all allowed a cent a day, and in driving times they get more—yes, up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen milrays a day.I’ve paid a hundred and fifteen myself, within the week.’Rah for protection—to Sheol with free-trade!”"
"他面对着大家，脸上如拨云见日般灿烂。不过我可没被他唬住。我匆匆发动了我的打桩机，给我自己十五分钟把他打进地里去——把他完完全全打进去——直打得他连一丝脑袋瓜都看不到了才算数。我是这么整他的。我问道：","And his face shone upon the company like a sunburst.But I didn’t scare at all.I rigged up my pile-driver, and allowed myself fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth—drive him ALL in—drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show above ground.Here is the way I started in on him.I asked:"
"“你们一磅盐要多少钱？”","“What do you pay a pound for salt?”"
"“一百密尔雷。”","“A hundred milrays.”"
"“我们付五十就行。你们牛肉和羊肉要多少钱——买的时候？”这一下直中要害，他的脸变了颜色。","“We pay forty.What do you pay for beef and mutton—when you buy it?” 　That was a neat hit; it made the color come."
"“各处稍有差异，不过没差多少；大概七十五密尔雷一磅。”","“It varieth somewhat, but not much; one may say 75 milrays the pound.”"
"“我们要三十三。你们的鸡蛋要多少钱？”","“WE pay 33.What do you pay for eggs?”"
"“五十密尔雷一打”","“Fifty milrays the dozen.”"
"“我们要二十。啤酒多少钱？”","“We pay 20.What do you pay for beer?”"
"“一品脱要八个半密尔雷。”","“It costeth us 8 1/2 milrays the pint.”"
"“我们要四个，一分钱二十五瓶。你们小麦多少钱？”","“We get it for 4; 25 bottles for a cent.What do you pay for wheat?”"
"“九百密尔雷一蒲式耳。”","“At the rate of 900 milrays the bushel.”"
"“我们是四百。你们男式粗麻布衣服一套卖多少钱？”","“We pay 400.What do you pay for a man’s towlinen suit?”"
"“十三分钱”","“Thirteen cents.”"
"“我们卖六分。“体力劳动者和手艺人的老婆所穿的毛料女装你们一套要多少钱？”","“We pay 6.What do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the laborer or the mechanic?”"
"“我们卖八分四厘。”","“We pay 8.4.0.”"
"“嗯，瞧瞧这差距吧：你们付八分四密尔，我们只要付四分。”现在我准备对他发难了。我说：“瞧瞧，亲爱的朋友，你几分钟前吹嘘的高收入现在怎么样了呢？”——说着我环视了众人一遍，微微有些得意，因为你瞧，我一步一步诱他犯错，束缚得他没法施展拳脚，而他压根儿还没发现自己被束缚住了。“你们那了不起的高收入究竟怎么样了呢？——在我看来，我似乎让它们都一蹶不振了。”","“Well, observe the difference: you pay eight cents and four mills, we pay only four cents.” 　I prepared now to sock it to him.l said: “Look here, dear friend, WHAT’S BECOME OF YOUR HIGH WAGES YOU WERE BRAGGING SO ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO?”—and I looked around on the company with placid satisfaction, for I had slipped up on him gradually and tied him hand and foot, you see, without his ever noticing that he was being tied at all.“What’s become of those noble high wages of yours?—I seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them, it appears to me.”"
"可是你肯定不会相信，他只是看上去有点吃惊，别的什么也没有了！　他根本就没弄清楚状况，还不知道自己已经走进了陷阱，没有发现自己就在陷阱里。就冲着这份恼怒，我真想一枪崩了他。他眼神迷离，想了半天才说出了这番话：","But if you will believe me, he merely looked surprised, that is all!He didn’t grasp the situation at all, didn’t know he had walked into a trap, didn’t discover that he was IN a trap.I could have shot him, from sheer vexation.With cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out:"
"“哎呀，我似乎弄不太懂。明摆着我们的工钱是你们的两倍；怎么一会儿又成了你让它们一蹶不振了呢？——但愿这个稀罕词儿我没说错，因为上帝保佑，我还是头一次听说呢。”","“Marry, I seem not to understand.It is PROVED that our wages be double thine; how then may it be that thou’st knocked therefrom the stuffing?—an miscall not the wonderly word, this being the first time under grace and providence of God it hath been granted me to hear it.”"
"我顿时愕然了。一半是因为他这人笨得非比寻常，一半是因为他那些伙伴们竟公然支持他，脑子想的和他的一样——如果你能称之为脑子的话。我的观点已经够简单，够明了了；还能怎么再简单点呢？不过，我必须试上一试：","Well, I was stunned; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on his part, and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mind—if you might call it mind.My position was simple enough, plain enough; how could it ever be simplified more?However, I must try:"
"“哎，你瞧瞧，道利老兄，你还不明白吗？你们的收入只不过是名义上比我们的高，实际上并不高。”","“Why, look here, brother Dowley, don’t you see?Your wages are merely higher than ours in NAME, not in FACT.”"
"“听听他说的话！我们的不是你们的两倍吗——你自己也承认了。”","“Hear him!They are the DOUBLE—ye have confessed it yourself.”"
"“不错不错，这点我绝不否认。可是那是两码子事；收入的数目是用钱币来衡量的，而给钱币起名字只不过是为了记住它们，没什么意义，和那不是一回事。关键是，你能用你的收入买多少东西？——这才是问题所在。虽然说得不错，你们一个不错的手艺人一年能挣三块半，而我们的一年只能挣一块零七十五——”","“Yes-yes, I don’t deny that at all. 　But that’s got nothing to do with it; the AMOUNT of the wages in mere coins, with meaningless names attached to them to know them by, has got nothing to do with it.The thing is, how much can you BUY with your wages?—that’s the idea.While it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year, and with us only about a dollar and seventy-five—”"
"“你看——你又承认了，你又承认了！”","“There—ye’re confessing it again, ye’re confessing it again!”"
"“去他妈的，我从来没否认过，我告诉你！　我说的是这意思。我们半块钱买的东西比你们一块钱买的多——因此说我们的收入比你们的高，这不是很合理吗，是最浅显最符合常理的了。”","“Confound it, I’ve never denied it, I tell you!What I say is this.With us HALF a dollar buys more than a DOLLAR buys with you—and THEREFORE it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common-sense, that our wages are HIGHER than yours.”"
"他看起来很茫然，绝望地喊道：","He looked dazed, and said, despairingly:"
"“我真搞不懂啦。你刚说我们的更高，可话音还没落又改口了。”","“Verily, I cannot make it out. 　Ye’ve just said ours are the higher, and with the same breath ye take it back.”"
"“噢，我的妈呀，就这么简单点事，你怎么可能就搞不懂呢？啊呀——让我给你讲讲吧。我们买一件女式毛料长袍要四分钱，你们要八分四厘，比我们的贵了一倍还多四密尔。在田里劳作的妇女你们付多少钱？”","“Oh, great Scott, isn’t it possible to get such a simple thing through your head?Now look here—let me illustrate.We pay four cents for a woman’s stuff gown, you pay 8.4.0, which is four mills more than DOUBLE.What do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm?”"
"“两厘一天。”","“Two mills a day.”"
"“很好；我们只付你们的一半；我们付给她一厘一天；而且——”","“Very good; we allow but half as much; we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day; and—”"
"“你又承认了——”","“Again ye’re conf—”"
"“别忙！现在，你瞧，问题很简单了；这回你就能明白了。举个例子，你们的妇女一天挣两厘，要花四十二天赚到一件长袍钱——相当于七个工作周；可是我们的妇女花四十天就能赚到她的——还差两天才算七个工作周。你们的妇女有了长袍，可是整整七个周的收入就没了；我们的有了长袍，还有两天的工资剩下来，好买点别的什么。瞧——现在你懂了吧！”","“Wait!Now, you see, the thing is very simple; this time you’ll understand it.For instance, it takes your woman 42 days to earn her gown, at 2 mills a day—7 weeks’ work; but ours earns hers in forty days—two days SHORT of 7 weeks.Your woman has a gown, and her whole seven weeks wages are gone; ours has a gown, and two days’ wages left, to buy something else with.There—NOW you understand it!”"
"他看起来——唉，他看起来仅仅是半信半疑的样子，我最多能这么说了；其他人也是一样。我等着——等着我的话起效用。道利最后还是说话了——这下露了底，才知道他根本就没从他那根深蒂固的迷糊想法里挣脱出来。他稍微有点迟疑地说道：","He looked—well, he merely looked dubious, it’s the most I can say; so did the others.I waited—to let the thing work.Dowley spoke at last—and betrayed the fact that he actually hadn’t gotten away from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet.He said, with a trifle of hesitancy:"
"“可是——可是——你不能否认两厘一天总比一厘强吧。”","“But—but—ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better than one.”"
"呸！唉，当然了，我绝不会放弃。因此，我又使出一招。","Shucks!Well, of course, I hated to give it up. 　So I chanced another flyer:"
"“让我们打这么个比方吧。假设你手下的短工出门买了以下物品：","“Let us suppose a case.Suppose one of your journeymen goes out and buys the following articles:"
"一磅盐，一大鸡蛋，十二品脱啤酒，一蒲式耳小麦，一件粗麻衣服，五磅牛肉和五磅羊肉。　","1 pound of salt; 1 dozen eggs; 1 dozen pints of beer; 1 bushel of wheat; 1 tow-linen suit; 5 pounds of beef; 5 pounds of mutton."
"这些要花去他三十二分钱。他要用三十二个工作日来挣这些钱——五周零两天。若让他到我们那儿，以一半的工资干上三十二天；他可以花不到十四分半就可以买到所有那些东西；花了还不到二十九天干活挣的钱，还能剩下半个星期的工资。按一年来算，他每两个月就可以省下一个星期的工资，而你们的人什么也剩不下；他一年能省下五六个星期的工资，你们的一分都没有。此时我觉得你该懂了吧，‘高收入’和‘低收入’只是些没有意义的词语，除非你能弄明白它们谁能买到更多的东西！”","The lot will cost him 32 cents.It takes him 32 working days to earn the money—5 weeks and 2 days.Let him come to us and work 32 days at HALF the wages; he can buy all those things for a shade under 14 1/2 cents; they will cost him a shade under 29 days‘ work, and he will have about half a week’s wages over.Carry it through the year; he would save nearly a week’s wages every two months, YOUR man nothing; thus saving five or six weeks’ wages in a year, your man not a cent.NOW I reckon you understand that ‘high wages’ and ‘low wages’ are phrases that don’t mean anything in the world until you find out which of them will BUY the most!”"
"这可是杀手锏！　","It was a crusher."
"可是，老天！　杀手锏也没杀了谁。唉，我不得不认输了。那些人看重的只是高收入；至于高收入能不能买来什么东西，似乎根本就无关紧要。他们赞成“保护政策”，迷信“保护政策”，这也可以理解，因为相关利益集团哄他们相信，正是保护政策创造了他们的高收入。我向他们证明，二十五年来，他们的工资涨了只有百分之三十，而生活成本却涨了一倍；而对于我们来说，还不到二十五年，工资涨了百分之四十，而生活成本却在不断下降。可是这也没什么用。什么也消除不了他们那些奇怪的信仰。","But, alas!it didn’t crush.No, I had to give it up.What those people valued was HIGH WAGES; it didn’t seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not.They stood for “protection”, and swore by it, which was reasonable enough, because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages.I proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent., while the cost of living had gone up 100; and that with us, in a shorter time, wages had advanced 40 per cent. while the cost of living had gone steadily down.But it didn’t do any good.Nothing could unseat their strange beliefs."
"唉，我心中充满了失败感，太痛苦了。本不该失败的，可又能怎样？那一点也缓解不了我的痛苦。而且想想当时的情形！当代第一政治家，最能干的人，全球最博学的人，最高贵的无冕之王，千年以来历经政坛风云，如今却坐在这儿，与一群无知的乡下铁匠争辩，显然是败下阵来的！而且我还看出，其他人也都在为我难过呢——这让我脸都烧红了，仿佛都能闻到胡子烧焦的味道。你设身处地想想看，体验一下我糟糕的处境，无地自容的感觉——你难道不会想暗地里报复一下，扯平一下吗？不错，你会这样；这不过是人性使然。嗯，我就是这么做的。我不是为了给自己开脱；我只是说我已经疯了，换谁都会这么干的。","Well, I was smarting under a sense of defeat.Undeserved defeat, but what of that?That didn’t soften the smart any.And to think of the circumstances!The first statesman of the age, the capablest man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith!And I could see that those others were sorry for me—which made me blush till I could smell my whiskers scorching.Put yourself in my place; feel as mean as I did, as ashamed as I felt—wouldn’t YOU have struck below the belt to get even?Yes, you would; it is simply human nature.Well, that is what I did.I am not trying to justify it; I’m only saying that I was mad, and ANYBODY would have done it."
"哼，要是我下定决心要揍谁，就绝不会准备轻轻爱抚几下就完；不，这不是我的做法，只要我打算揍了，我就会揍扁他。而且我也不会猛地扑过去，以免过于浮躁而功亏一篑；不，我会远远躲到一边，一步一步算计他，因此他绝不会怀疑我竟然会揍他；然后，一眨眼的功夫，他就会四脚朝天，而且直到死他也不会明白这是怎么发生的。我就是这么收拾道利老兄的。我开始说起话来，懒懒散散，悠哉游哉，好像我只是为了打发时间而聊聊天。全世界最老练的人也猜不透我的用意何在，猜不出我要干什么：","Well, when I make up my mind to hit a man, I don’t plan out a love-tap; no, that isn’t my way; as long as I’m going to hit him at all, I’m going to hit him a lifter.And I don’t jump at him all of a sudden, and risk making a blundering half-way business of it; no, I get away off yonder to one side, and work up on him gradually, so that he never suspects that I’m going to hit him at all; and by and by, all in a flash, he’s flat on his back, and he can’t tell for the life of him how it all happened.That is the way I went for brother Dowley.I started to talking lazy and comfortable, as if I was just talking to pass the time; and the oldest man in the world couldn’t have taken the bearings of my starting place and guessed where I was going to fetch up:"
"“伙计们，只要你们留心就会发现，诸如法律、习俗、习惯之类，还有人类意见和行为的变迁，都是千奇百怪，无奇不有。我们有成文的法律——它们会消失；然而我们那些不成文的法律——它们会永恒不朽。就拿工资这条不成文的法律来说吧：它说工资会一点一点上涨，涨上一个又一个世纪。看看它是怎么起作用的。我们现在知道工资多少了，无论是这儿，那儿还是更远的地方；我们取个平均值，就算是现在的工资了。我们知道一百年前的工资是多少，两百年前的工资是多少。我们最远只能算到这儿了，不过也足够了，足够我们掌握发展的规则，掌握每个时期工资增长的幅度和速率了。所以，即使没有文献支持，我们也能大概推测出三四百年、四五百年前的工资了。目前为止，还不错。难道我们就要在这儿打住了吗？不会的。我们不会再向后看，我们会向前看，运用这个法则来看看将来。朋友们，无论你们想知道未来哪一天的工资多少，甚至几百年之后的，我都能告诉你们。”","“Boys, there’s a good many curious things about law, and custom, and usage, and all that sort of thing, when you come to look at it; yes, and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement, too. 　　There are written laws—they perish; but there are also unwritten laws—THEY are eternal.Take the unwritten law of wages: it says they’ve got to advance, little by little, straight through the centuries.And notice how it works.We know what wages are now, here and there and yonder; we strike an average, and say that’s the wages of to-day.We know what the wages were a hundred years ago, and what they were two hundred years ago; that’s as far back as we can get, but it suffices to give us the law of progress, the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation; and so, without a document to help us, we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago.Good, so far.Do we stop there?No. We stop looking backward; we face around and apply the law to the future.My friends, I can tell you what people’s wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know, for hundreds and hundreds of years.”"
"“真的吗，先生，当真！”","“What, goodman, what!”"
"“是的。七百年后工资会涨到现在的六倍，在你们这儿，农场工人一天能挣三分钱，手艺人能挣六分。”","“Yes.In seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times what they are now, here in your region, and farm hands will be allowed 3 cents a day, and mechanics 6.”"
"“我真希望自己现在死掉，好托生在那个时候！”车匠斯玛格插了一句，眼睛里闪着贪婪的光芒。","“I would’t I might die now and live then!” interrupted Smug, the wheelwright, with a fine avaricious glow in his eye."
"“不仅如此，除了工钱，还包食宿——就和现在差不多：饿不死也撑不死。二百五十年之后——现在请注意——一个手艺人的工钱会是——请注意，这是根据法则推算的，不是瞎猜，一个手艺人的工钱将会是一天二十分钱！”","“And that isn’t all; they’ll get their board besides—such as it is: it won’t bloat them.Two hundred and fifty years later—pay attention now—a mechanic’s wages will be—mind you, this is law, not guesswork; a mechanic’s wages will then be TWENTY cents a day!”"
"大家都又惊又怕，大喘着气；石匠狄肯翻着眼，举着手，低声嘀咕道：","There was a general gasp of awed astonishment, Dickon the mason murmured, with raised eyes and hands:"
"“干一天活能挣三个周的工钱还多哩！”","“More than three weeks’ pay for one day’s work!”"
"“发大财了！——真的，发大财了！”马可咕哝道，激动得呼吸都急促了。","“Riches!—of a truth, yes, riches!” muttered Marco, his breath coming quick and short, with excitement."
"“工资会持续上涨，一点一点，一点一点，就好像树木一样不停长高，最后，过了三百四十多年，至少会有一个国家的手艺人平均工资达到一天两百分！”","“Wages will keep on rising, little by little, little by little, as steadily as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and forty years more there’ll be at least ONE country where the mechanic’s average wage will be TWO HUNDRED cents a day!”"
"这下震得他们一句话也说不出来了！　接下来有两分钟他们没有一个人能喘过气来。随后烧炭工用祈祷的口气说道：","It knocked them absolutely dumb!Not a man of them could get his breath for upwards of two minutes.Then the coal-burner said prayerfully:"
"“但愿能活到那一天！”","“Might I but live to see it!”"
"“伯爵的收入也不过如此！”斯玛格说到。","“It is the income of an earl!” said Smug."
"“你说的是伯爵吗？”道利说，“即便说点头衔更高的也不算说谎；在巴格狄玛格斯王国，没有一个伯爵能有这么高的收入。伯爵的收入——切！这是天使的收入！”","“An earl, say ye?” said Dowley; “ye could say more than that and speak no lie; there’s no earl in the realm of Bagdemagus that hath an income like to that.Income of an earl—mf!It’s the income of an angel!”"
"“好了，那么，关于工资将来就是这样的。在遥远的将来，有那么一天，人只要干一个星期的活，买到的东西就相当于你们干五十多个星期的活买到的。此外，还会发生其他让你们大为震惊的事情。道利老兄，每年春天，是谁来决定本年度各种手艺人、工人和仆人的具体工资数目呢？”","“Now, then, that is what is going to happen as regards wages.In that remote day, that man will earn, with ONE week’s work, that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of FIFTY weeks to earn now. 　Some other pretty surprising things are going to happen, too. 　Brother Dowley, who is it that determines, every spring, what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic, laborer, and servant shall be for that year?”"
"“有时是法院，有时是市议会，不过大多时候都是地方行政官。总而言之，你可以说是地方行政官最终定工资的。”","“Sometimes the courts, sometimes the town council; but most of all, the magistrate.Ye may say, in general terms, it is the magistrate that fixes the wages.”"
"“那他会从这些穷鬼中找个人帮他定他们的工资，是不是呢？”","“Doesn’t ask any of those poor devils to HELP him fix their wages for them, does he?”"
"“哼！倒真敢想！出工钱的是雇主，理所当然是他和这件事有关了，你还看不出来。”","“Hm!That WERE an idea!The master that’s to pay him the money is the one that’s rightly concerned in that matter, ye will notice ”"
"“说得对——不过我还是认为那个拿工钱的人和此事也该稍微有点利害关系；甚至于他的老婆孩子，那些可怜的家伙们，也该有。雇主不外乎是这些人：贵族，富翁，总的来说就是有钱人。这些不干活的人，为数不多，却决定着广大劳动人民的工资数目。你明白了吧？他们是个联合体——套用个新词，就是工会——他们靠工会勾结在一起，来逼迫比自己地位低的兄弟们接受他们出的工钱。一千三百年之后——根据那个不成文的法则——这个联合体就会变成另外一个样子，那时这些上等人的子孙面对横行霸道的工会，会怒火中烧，烦躁不安，外加咬牙切齿！不错，就是这样！地方行政官从现在到十九世纪都能平平静静地制定工资；然后，突然之间挣工钱的人会觉得这种单方面说了算的事情进行了几千年，真是受够了；他就会奋起反抗，自己制定自己的工资。啊，他饱尝辛酸，受了那么长时间的虐待和屈辱，这笔老账可够他算的。”","“Yes—but I thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it, too; and even his wife and children, poor creatures.The masters are these: nobles, rich men, the prosperous generally.These few, who do no work, determine what pay the vast hive shall have who DO work.You see?They’re a ‘combine’—a trade union, to coin a new phrase—who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give.Thirteen hundred years hence—so says the unwritten law—the ‘combine’ will be the other way, and then how these fine people’s posterity will fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions!Yes, indeed!The magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century; and then all of a sudden the wage-earner will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this one-sided sort of thing; and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself.Ah, he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle.”"
"“你真的相信——”","“Do ye believe—”"
"“相信他真的会插手定自己的工资？是的，不错。而且到那时他一定是非常强大，非常能干了。”","“That he actually will help to fix his own wages?Yes, indeed.And he will be strong and able, then.”"
"“新时代，新时代，说真的！”有钱的铁匠冷笑道。","“Brave times, brave times, of a truth!” sneered the prosperous smith."
"“哦——还有一件小事。那时，要是雇主要雇人，只能一次雇一天，或者一星期，或者一个月。”","“Oh,—and there’s another detail.In that day, a master may hire a man for only just one day, or one week, or one month at a time, if he wants to.”"
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“这是真的。而且，地方行政官不会再不管人家愿不愿意，都逼迫人家为雇主连续干一年的活了。”","“It’s true.Moreover, a magistrate won’t be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not.”"
"“那个时候难道就没有王法，不讲道理了吗？”","“Will there be NO law or sense in that day?”"
"“不是没有王法，不讲道理了，道利。到那时人人都是自己的主人，而不是市长和雇主的财产。而且如果工钱不合适，他想离开城里就离开，只要他乐意！——他们不能为这让人家戴枷示众。”","“Both of them, Dowley.In that day a man will be his own property, not the property of magistrate and master.And he can leave town whenever he wants to, if the wages don’t suit him!—and they can’t put him in the pillory for it.”"
"“如此世道，让它灭亡吧！”道利怒气冲冲地大喊，“猪狗不如的世道，个个欺君罔上，目无尊长！木枷——”","“Perdition catch such an age!” shouted Dowley, in strong indignation.“An age of dogs, an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority!The pillory—”"
"“噢，且慢，老兄；不要再为那个制度说好话了。我认为木枷早就该废除了。”","“Oh, wait, brother; say no good word for that institution.I think the pillory ought to be abolished.”"
"“想法甚为古怪！却是为何？”","“A most strange idea.Why?”"
"“咳，让我来告诉你为什么吧。一个人被投进木枷里是因为他犯了什么滔天大罪吗？”","“Well, I’ll tell you why.Is a man ever put in the pillory for a capital crime?”"
"“不是。”","“No.”"
"“那因为一个人犯了点小罪，判他轻微受点处罚，结果却要了他的命，这合理吗？”","“Is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small offense and then kill him?”"
"没有回应。我赢得了第一分！头一次，这位铁匠不再是那么情绪激昂，反应敏捷了。大家都注意到了。好极了。","There was no answer.I had scored my first point!For the first time, the smith wasn’t up and ready.The company noticed it.　Good effect."
"“你怎么不回答了，老兄。刚才你不是还要歌颂木枷，还要对未来没有木枷的年代惋惜不已。我觉得木枷就该废除。可怜的家伙，因为小小的罪过，其实压根也算不了什么，就要戴枷示众，通常是个什么情形？那些暴民会拿他取乐，是不是？”","“You don’t answer, brother.You were about to glorify the pillory a while ago, and shed some pity on a future age that isn’t going to use it.　I think the pillory ought to be abolished.What usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some little offense that didn’t amount to anything in the world?The mob try to have some fun with him, don’t they?”"
"“不错。”","“Yes.”"
"“他们开始拿土块砸他，而当他躲避不迭被砸中时，他们是不是都笑开了花？”","“They begin by clodding him; and they laugh themselves to pieces to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“接着他们又朝他扔死猫，是不是？”","“Then they throw dead cats at him, don’t they?”"
"“对。”","“Yes.”"
"“嗯，那么，假设这群暴民中有跟他有私仇的对头，或者一两个暗地里对他怀恨在心的男人或女人——特别是，再想想他在邻里之间不大招人喜欢，因为太自傲了，混得太好了，或者别的什么——那么石头和砖头立马就会取代土块和死猫了，是不是？”","“Well, then, suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against him—and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community, for his pride, or his prosperity, or one thing or another—stones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently, don’t they?”"
"“毋庸置疑。”","“There is no doubt of it.”"
"“通常说来他这辈子就算残废，是不是？——是不是下巴也折了，牙也打掉了？——或是腿也打折了，得了坏疽，不久还得锯掉？——或是一只眼也给砸了出来，也许两只眼都是？”","“As a rule he is crippled for life, isn’t he?—jaws broken, teeth smashed out?—or legs mutilated, gangrened, presently cut off?—or an eye knocked out, maybe both eyes?”"
"“的确如此，上帝明鉴。”","“It is true, God knoweth it.”"
"“而如果他不招人待见，他就只能呆在木枷里死掉，是不是？”","“And if he is unpopular he can depend on DYING, right there in the stocks, can’t he?”"
"“他必定会的！谁也不会否认。”","“He surely can!One may not deny it.”"
"“我想你们当中没谁不招人待见吧——都不是那种傲慢无礼，或是超级招风，或是有什么让村里那些下流种子眼红而起了坏心的吧？你们不会认为要是有机会在木枷里呆一下会很冒险吧？”","“I take it none of YOU are unpopular—by reason of pride or insolence, or conspicuous prosperity, or any of those things that excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village?YOU wouldn’t think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks?”"
"道利的脸很明显地抽动了一下。我断定他是受了重创了。不过他没有说出来。而其他人则直接情绪激昂地说了出来。他们说看到过太多木枷了，知道要是关在木枷里会是个什么滋味，要是能通融通融，他们宁愿被绞死，死得痛快点，也不要进到木枷里去。","Dowley winced, visibly.I judged he was hit.But he didn’t betray it by any spoken word.As for the others, they spoke out plainly, and with strong feeling.They said they had seen enough of the stocks to know what a man’s chance in them was, and they would never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick death by hanging."
"“哦，还是换个话题吧——因为我觉得我的观点已经很明了了，木枷应该被废除。我认为我们的法律很不公正。比如说，若我犯了点什么事，该戴枷示众，你们知道我的所做所为而仍然保持沉默不去报告，如果有人告发你们，你们就会受木枷之刑。”","“Well, to change the subject—for I think I’ve established my point that the stocks ought to be abolished.I think some of our laws are pretty unfair.For instance, if I do a thing which ought to deliver me to the stocks, and you know I did it and yet keep still and don’t report me, YOU will get the stocks if anybody informs on you.”"
"“啊，不过你也是罪有应得，”道利说，“因为你必须去告发。法律就是这么规定的。”","“Ah, but that would serve you but right,” said Dowley, “for you MUST inform.So saith the law.”"
"其他人也纷纷附和。","The others coincided."
"“唉，好吧，那就不说了，既然你们把我否决了。不过还有一件事肯定是不公平的。比如说地方行政官把手艺人的工钱定为一天一分钱。法律规定，任何一位雇主，无论生意上多么缺人手，要是胆敢付多于一分钱一天的工钱，哪怕只是一天，也会被罚款，还要戴枷示众；而那些知情的人如果不告发，也会被罚款和戴枷示众。现在我觉得很不公平，道利，而且我还认为大家都处于致命的危险，因为你刚才无意中泄露，本周之内你就曾付过一分十五厘一天——”","“Well, all right, let it go, since you vote me down.But there’s one thing which certainly isn’t fair.The magistrate fixes a mechanic’s wage at 1 cent a day, for instance.The law says that if any master shall venture, even under utmost press of business, to pay anything OVER that cent a day, even for a single day, he shall be both fined and pilloried for it; and whoever knows he did it and doesn’t inform, they also shall be fined and pilloried.Now it seems to me unfair, Dowley, and a deadly peril to all of us, that because you thoughtlessly confessed, a while ago, that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil—”"
"哈，告诉你吧，这招可算是重拳出击！　真可惜你没看到那一大帮子人被打击得支离破碎的样子。我满脸笑容，不慌不忙，轻手轻脚地靠近那个可怜的道利，他一直是笑呵呵的，洋洋自得，根本没有疑心会有什么事发生，直到我突然一击把他打倒在地，打成了碎片。","Oh, I tell YOU it was a smasher!You ought to have seen them to go to pieces, the whole gang.I had just slipped up on poor smiling and complacent Dowley so nice and easy and softly, that he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow came crashing down and knocked him all to rags."
"干得漂亮。事实上，虽然没时间容我多想，我从来没干得这么漂亮。","A fine effect.In fact, as fine as any I ever produced, with so little time to work it up in."
"不过我马上就意识到有点做过头了。我是打算吓唬一下他们，但是没打算把他们吓死。可是他们差点就被吓死了。你瞧，他们穷其一生都在学习欣赏木枷的妙处；可是他们也不可避免地要戴上木枷，而且每个人的命显然都握在我，一个外来者的手里，如果我选择去告发他们——唉，真是太可怕了，他们吓得魂儿都没了，再也振作不起来了。是不是面如死灰，浑身颤抖，哑口无言，可怜兮兮？　嗨，他们比死人强不了多少。看着真让人难受。　我想当然认为他们会求我缄口勿言，然后我们就握个手，拿酒干上一圈，笑两声，事情就算过去了。可是，没有；你瞧，我是个生人，而他们这个民族被残酷地压迫着，戒心很强，并且总是因为软弱无助被人欺负，除了自己的家人和至亲好友，从没指望谁会对自己公正一点，好一点。还能求我对他们和善公正，慷慨大方吗？当然，他们想是想了，可是他们哪敢。","But I saw in a moment that I had overdone the thing a little.I was expecting to scare them, but I wasn’t expecting to scare them to death.They were mighty near it, though.You see they had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory; and to have that thing staring them in the face, and every one of them distinctly at the mercy of me, a stranger, if I chose to go and report—well, it was awful, and they couldn’t seem to recover from the shock, they couldn’t seem to pull themselves together.Pale, shaky, dumb, pitiful?Why, they weren’t any better than so many dead men. 　It was very uncomfortable.Of course, I thought they would appeal to me to keep mum, and then we would shake hands, and take a drink all round, and laugh it off, and there an end. 　But no; you see I was an unknown person, among a cruelly oppressed and suspicious people, a people always accustomed to having advantage taken of their helplessness, and never expecting just or kind treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates.Appeal to ME to be gentle, to be fair, to be generous?Of course, they wanted to, but they couldn’t dare."
"第三十四章　美国人与国王被卖为奴","CHAPTER 34 The Yankee and the King Sold as Slaves"
"嗯，我该怎么办才好呢？当然，千万不能着急。我必须想个法子转移一下注意力,找件事能让我一边干着一边想点事，与此同时还让这些可怜的家伙们有机会缓过神来。马可坐在那儿吓呆了，还保持着琢磨那支钱枪机关的姿势——变成了石头，就跟我的打桩机落下来时的姿势一模一样，那个玩具还在他已经失去知觉的手里握着呢。所以我就把它从他手里拿了过来，打算解释一下其中的奥妙。奥妙！　就这么个简单的小东西，可是对于那个种族，那个时代，还确实是够玄妙的。","WELL, what had I better do?Nothing in a hurry, sure.I must get up a diversion; anything to employ me while I could think, and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life again.There sat Marco, petrified in the act of trying to get the hang of his miller-gun—turned to stone, just in the attitude he was in when my pile-driver fell, the toy still gripped in his unconscious fingers.So I took it from him and proposed to explain its mystery.Mystery!　Ａ simple little thing like that; and yet it was mysterious enough, for that race and that age."
"我从没见过摆弄起机器来能如此笨拙的人，你瞧，他们根本就用不惯。　所谓钱枪就是一个小小的双筒硬玻璃管，里面装着个巧妙的弹簧小机关，一按就有一粒子弹弹出来。不过这个子弹不会伤人，它只是落到你的手里而已。　枪里装两个型号的子弹——一种是小一点的，像芥子那么大的子弹，另一种要比它大上几倍。它们都是钱。芥子大小的子弹代表密尔雷，大一点的是密尔。因此一管枪就是一个钱包，还很方便，就是在黑暗中你也能分毫不差地付钱。你可以把它叼在嘴里，或者放在背心口袋里，如果你有背心的话。　我造了好几个型号的钱枪——大号的能装相当于一块钱的子弹。对于政府来说用子弹来当钱是个好事，那些金属花不了多少钱，而且这种钱也无法伪造，因为在这个国家我是唯一知道怎么用塔楼来造子弹的。“付子弹”很快就成为人人都说的词语了。　不错，我就知道大家会众口相传，一直传到十九世纪，却没人知晓这个词从何而来，什么时候产生的。","I never saw such an awkward people, with machinery; you see, they were totally unused to it.The miller-gun was a little double-barreled tube of toughened glass, with a neat little trick of a spring to it, which upon pressure would let a shot escape.But the shot wouldn’t hurt anybody, it would only drop into your hand.In the gun were two sizes—wee mustardseed shot, and another sort that were several times larger.They were money.The mustard-seed shot represented milrays, the larger ones mills.So the gun was a purse; and very handy, too; you could pay out money in the dark with it, with accuracy; and you could carry it in your mouth; or in your vest pocket, if you had one.I made them of several sizes—one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar.Using shot for money was a good thing for the government; the metal cost nothing, and the money couldn’t be counterfeited, for I was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower.“Paying the shot” soon came to be a common phrase.Yes, and I knew it would still be passing men’s lips, away down in the nineteenth century, yet none would suspect how and when it originated."
"国王此时也加入了我们，他刚刚打了个盹儿，感觉不错。现在什么事都能让我紧张，我是如此焦虑不安——因为我们现在命悬一线。因此当我发现国王眼中闪过一丝沾沾自喜的神色，仿佛是踌躇满志准备要露一手时，我真是捏了一把汗，去他妈的，他非得挑这么个时候吗？","The king joined us, about this time, mightily refreshed by his nap, and feeling good.Anything could make me nervous now, I was so uneasy—for our lives were in danger; and so it worried me to detect a complacent something in the king’s eye which seemed to indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other; confound it, why must he go and choose such a time as this?"
"我猜的没错。他一开口就径直把话题往种地上引，用的手法还极其小儿科，极其露骨，愚蠢无比。我全身直冒冷汗。我很想对着他的耳朵小声说：“喂，咱们的处境很危险！在重新赢得这些人的信任之前，分分秒秒都价值连城，不要浪费宝贵的时间。”不过我当然不能这么做。跟他低语？别人会以为我俩在搞什么阴谋呢。因此我只得假装很平静很愉快地坐在那儿，而国王则站在那个地雷上，一通闲扯，侃些洋葱之类见鬼的玩意儿。刚开始我脑子里乱糟糟的，危险的信号招致脑子中各路思绪都纷纷赶来救援，挤成一团，狂呼乱叫，一片混乱，吹笛击鼓，以至于我一个字也没听进去；　不过不一会儿我为了想出方案而变得乱哄哄的思绪就开始明朗起来，各就各位，摆好了阵式，变得井然有序，开始平静下来，这下我终于听清了国王那轰鸣的炮声，仿佛从远处传了过来：","I was right.He began, straight off, in the most innocently artful, and transparent, and lubberly way, to lead up to the subject of agriculture.The cold sweat broke out all over me. 　I wanted to whisper in his ear, “Man, we are in awful danger!Every moment is worth a principality till we get back these men’s confidence; DON’T waste any of this golden time.”  But of course I couldn’t do it.  Whisper to him?It would look as if we were conspiring.So I had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his damned onions and things.At first the tumult of my own thoughts, summoned by the danger-signal and swarming to the rescue from every quarter of my skull, kept up such a hurrah and confusion and fifing and drumming that I couldn’t take in a word; but presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize and fall into position and form line of battle, a sort of order and quiet ensued and I caught the boom of the king’s batteries, as if out of remote distance:"
"“——我认为不是最好的方法，尽管无可否认权威人士对这点各持己见，有人声称若早早从树上打落，洋葱还是未成熟的浆果——”","“—were not the best way, methinks, albeit it is not to be denied that authorities differ as concerning this point, some contending that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early from the tree—”"
"听着的人总算是有了点活气，面面相觑，又是吃惊又是困惑。","The audience showed signs of life, and sought each other’s eyes in a surprised and troubled way."
"“——然而其他人还是据理力争，认为此说未必妥当，并举例说明，像李子和其他谷物都是不待成熟便从地里挖出——”","“—whileas others do yet maintain, with much show of reason, that this is not of necessity the case, instancing that plums and other like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state—”"
"那些听众明显流露出痛苦的神情；是的，还有恐惧。","The audience exhibited distinct distress; yes, and also fear."
"“——然而他们显然是对人体有益的，尤其是当你为了缓解其酸涩之性而加入具有清心降火功效的硬白菜汁——”","“—yet are they clearly wholesome, the more especially when one doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage—”"
"这些人个个眼睛发亮，闪着恐惧的光芒，其中一个还咕哝道：“全然不对，没一句对的——这个农户的脑子一定是让上帝给砸烂了。”我真是提心吊胆，痛苦不堪，如坐针毡。","The wild light of terror began to glow in these men’s eyes, and one of them muttered, “These be errors, every one—God hath surely smitten the mind of this farmer.” I was in miserable apprehension; I sat upon thorns."
"“——再举一例众所周知的事实，动物中也是幼者为佳，可以称作是动物中的青涩果实，普遍承认山羊成熟后，毛皮过于厚热，累得肉体酸痛，当然再加上还有其他恶习和令人作呕的喜好，目无神明，暴躁易怒，品行不端——”","“—and further instancing the known truth that in the case of animals, the young, which may be called the green fruit of the creature, is the better, all confessing that when a goat is ripe, his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh, the which defect, taken in connection with his several rancid habits, and fulsome appetites, and godless attitudes of mind, and bilious quality of morals—”"
"他们起身要揍他！还伴着一声怒吼：“一个要告发我们，另一个疯掉了！　杀死他们！　杀死他们！”他们朝我俩扑了过来。国王的眼中燃起了喜悦的火焰！　关于种地他是不大在行，不过这种事正对他的胃口。他好久没过瘾，早就想大战一场了。　他朝着铁匠的下巴重重一拳，打得铁匠两脚腾空，摔了个仰面朝天。“圣乔治保佑大不列颠！”他又打倒了车匠。石匠是个大块头，不过我不费吹灰之力就把他放倒了。　他们仨又挣扎着起来，再次冲了过来；又被打倒了；再冲过来；如此反复，尽显英国英雄本色，直到他们被打得稀巴烂，精疲力尽，站都站不稳，眼前发黑，都分不出我俩谁是谁了；然而他们还是接着往上上，拼尽最后一丝力气连打带踢。他们成了互相打斗——因为我们已经闪到一边，看着他们扭成一团，互相搏斗，连抠带挖，连打带咬，专心致志，一声不吭，就跟一大群斗牛狗似的。我们在一旁看着，一点也不担心，因为他们很快就会耗尽力气，没办法去搬救兵来对付我们了，而且战斗场地离大路太远，因此不会有人闯进来。","They rose and went for him!With a fierce shout, “The one would betray us, the other is mad!Kill them!Kill them!” They flung themselves upon us.What joy flamed up in the king’s eye!He might be lame in agriculture, but this kind of thing was just in his line.He had been fasting long, he was hungry for a fight.He hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear off his feet and stretched him flat on his back.“St. George for Britain!” and he downed the wheelwright.The mason was big, but I laid him out like nothing.The three gathered themselves up and came again; went down again; came again; and kept on repeating this, with native British pluck, until they were battered to jelly, reeling with exhaustion, and so blind that they couldn’t tell us from each other; and yet they kept right on, hammering away with what might was left in them.Hammering each other—for we stepped aside and looked on while they rolled, and struggled, and gouged, and pounded, and bit, with the strict and wordless attention to business of so many bulldogs.We looked on without apprehension, for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us, and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe from intrusion."
"唉，就在他们就要打完的时候，我突然想到马可现在怎么样了。　我四下一看，马可不见了。啊呀，这可不妙！我一拉国王的袖子，我俩溜了出来，朝那间小屋冲去。马可不在那儿，菲丽斯也不在！　他们肯定是跑到大路上搬救兵去了。　我告诉国王赶紧撒丫子开跑，稍后我再给他解释为什么。我们飞快地跑过一块空地，准备冲进树林躲起来，这时我转头一瞥，看到一群情绪激动的农民蜂拥而至，带头的正是马可和他老婆。他们吵吵嚷嚷沸反盈天，可是害不着谁；树林茂密，只要我们进到树林深处，就可以躲到树上，让他们空忙一场。　啊呀，可是紧接着就传来了另一种声音——是狗！　唉，这可就是另一回事了。困难放大了——我们必须找到流动的水。","Well, while they were gradually playing out, it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what had become of Marco.I looked around; he was nowhere to be seen.Oh, but this was ominous!I pulled the king’s sleeve, and we glided away and rushed for the hut.　No Marco there, no Phyllis there!They had gone to the road for help, sure.I told the king to give his heels wings, and I would explain later.We made good time across the open ground, and as we darted into the shelter of the wood I glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants swarm into view, with Marco and his wife at their head.They were making a world of noise, but that couldn’t hurt anybody; the wood was dense, and as soon as we were well into its depths we would take to a tree and let them whistle.Ah, but then came another sound—dogs!Yes, that was quite another matter.It magnified our contract—we must find running water."
"我们大步流星，一路逛奔，那些声音很快就被远远抛在了身后，低沉了下去。我们碰到一条小溪就一头扎了进去。　就着树林微弱的光线，我们顺流而下，蹚过三百码后碰到了一棵橡树，树上一根大树枝横过水面。我们爬上了树枝，开始往树干爬去；此时声音听得清楚些了，暴民们已经发现了我们的踪迹。有一阵子声音靠近得很快。随后一阵又没声了。毫无疑问狗已经发现了我们刚才踏进小溪的地方，现在正在两岸绕来绕去，试图再次找到我们的踪迹。","We tore along at a good gait, and soon left the sounds far behind and modified to a murmur.We struck a stream and darted into it.We waded swiftly down it, in the dim forest light, for as much as three hundred yards, and then came across an oak with a great bough sticking out over the water.We climbed up on this bough, and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree; now we began to hear those sounds more plainly; so the mob had struck our trail.For a while the sounds approached pretty fast.And then for another while they didn’t.No doubt the dogs had found the place where we had entered the stream, and were now waltzing up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again."
"我们舒舒服服地蜷在树上，茂密的树叶把我们遮了起来，国王很是满意，可我却不太放心。我觉得我们能沿着一根树枝爬到另一棵树上去，而且断定值得一试。我们就试了一试，居然成功了，尽管国王在两树交叉的地方滑了一下，差点掉下去。在树叶严密的遮蔽下，我们舒舒服服，心满意足，藏在树上无事可干，就剩下听听追赶我们的声音了。","When we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage, the king was satisfied, but I was doubtful.I believed we could crawl along a branch and get into the next tree, and I judged it worth while to try. 　We tried it, and made a success of it, though the king slipped, at the junction, and came near failing to connect.We got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among the foliage, and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt."
"很快我们就听到他们来到了——而且来势凶猛；不错，从河两岸抄了过来。声音大了——更大了——瞬时间人吼声，狗叫声，脚步声，声声交织，震天动地，仿佛一阵旋风般掠了过去。","Presently we heard it coming—and coming on the jump, too; yes, and down both sides of the stream.Louder—louder—next minute it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings, barkings, tramplings, and swept by like a cyclone."
"“我还担心那根横在上面的树枝能让他们想起点什么呢，”我说道，“不过他们没想起来我也不介意。来吧，陛下，我们最好抓紧点时间。我们已经在他们的侧面了。天马上就要黑了。如果我们能蹚过这条河，快跑几步，还能从谁家农场里借两匹马骑骑，跑上几个小时我们就安全了。”","“I was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something to them,” said I, “but I don’t mind the disappointment.Come, my liege, it were well that we make good use of our time.We’ve flanked them.Dark is coming on, presently.If we can cross the stream and get a good start, and borrow a couple of horses from somebody’s pasture to use for a few hours, we shall be safe enough.”"
"我俩开始从树上下来，还没下到最底下那根树枝时就听到追踪我们的人又回来了。我们停下来听了听。","We started down, and got nearly to the lowest limb, when we seemed to hear the hunt returning.We stopped to listen."
"“嗯，”我说，“他们给搞懵了，已经放弃，准备打道回府了。我们还是爬回老窝，等他们过去吧。”","“Yes,” said I, “they’re baffled, they’ve given it up, they’re on their way home.We will climb back to our roost again, and let them go by.”"
"于是我们又爬了回去。国王听了一会儿，说道：","So we climbed back.The king listened a moment and said:"
"“他们还在搜索——朕一听便知。我们最好还是等会儿。”","“They still search—I wit the sign.We did best to abide.”"
"他说的没错。关于狩围打猎他比我懂得多。声音慢慢靠近了，但来势不是很猛。国王说道：　","He was right.He knew more about hunting than I did.The noise approached steadily, but not with a rush.The king said:"
"“他们推断我们逃出不久，不难捕获，而且因为我俩是步行，不会离下水处太远。”","“They reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them, and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took the water.”"
"“正是，陛下，恐怕事情正是如此，尽管我没料到会如此糟糕。”","“Yes, sire, that is about it, I am afraid, though I was hoping better things.”"
"嘈杂声越来越近，转眼间先头部队就从河两岸包抄了过来在我们下面缓缓而行。一个声音从对岸传了过来，喊他们停住，说道：","The noise drew nearer and nearer, and soon the van was drifting under us, on both sides of the water.A voice called a halt from the other bank, and said:"
"“他们如此有头脑，有树枝横于水面，他们必定会通过这树枝爬到树上，离开地面。你们最好派人上去看看。”","“An they were so minded, they could get to yon tree by this branch that overhangs, and yet not touch ground.Ye will do well to send a man up it.”"
"“老天，我们就这么做吧！”","“Marry, that we will do!”"
"我不得不佩服自己的聪明才智，能够料事如神，换了棵树，打败了他们。可是，你知不知道，这世上还有能打败聪明才智和深谋远虑的？笨拙和愚蠢就能。世间第一剑客用不着害怕第二剑客；不，他该怕的反而是那种一窍不通的对手，以前连剑都没碰过的人；那样的人，该做的不做，却干些内行怎么也无法预料的事情，不该做的反而做了；内行十有八九会被那种人打个措手不及，当场结果了性命。唉，像我这么足智多谋的人，怎么能防备到这个近视眼加斗鸡眼还一脑袋糨糊的蠢货，竟然能爬错了树而歪打正着呢？他正是这么做的。他冲着本不该爬的这颗树来了，然而歪打正着就对了，马上开始爬了起来。","I was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing and swapping trees to beat it.But, don’t you know, there are some things that can beat smartness and foresight?Awkwardness and stupidity can.The best swordsman in the world doesn’t need to fear the second best swordsman in the world; no, the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before; he doesn’t do the thing he ought to do, and so the expert isn’t prepared for him; he does the thing he ought not to do; and often it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot.Well, how could I, with all my gifts, make any valuable preparation against a near-sighted, cross-eyed, pudding-headed clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right one?And that is what he did. 　He went for the wrong tree, which was, of course, the right one by mistake, and up he started."
"如今事态严重了。我们呆着一动不动，静观事态发展。　那个农民艰难地往上爬着。国王爬起身来，站在上面；他准备了一条腿，来者的脑袋刚刚能到他腿够得着的地方，就听见砰的一声闷响，那人就手脚乱抓摔下了地面。底下一顿愤怒的狂呼乱叫，暴民们从四面八方涌了过来，现在我们被困在树上，成了笼中之鸟。又一个人开始往上爬；他们发现了那个搭作桥梁的树枝，于是又有人自告奋勇往搭桥的那棵树上爬。国王命我扮演霍雷休斯，守住桥梁。有一阵子敌人来得又多又快；不过不要紧，每队打头的那个人刚爬到我们够得着的地方，就被重重一脚踢了下去。国王的兴致来了，高兴得要命。他说只要不出什么意外，我们今晚可以安然度过了，因为凭这种打法，即使周围乡村的人都来了，我们也能守住这棵树。","Matters were serious now.We remained still, and awaited developments.The peasant toiled his difficult way up.The king raised himself up and stood; he made a leg ready, and when the comer’s head arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud, and down went the man floundering to the ground.There was a wild outbreak of anger below, and the mob swarmed in from all around, and there we were treed, and prisoners.Another man started up; the bridging bough was detected, and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge.The king ordered me to play Horatius and keep the bridge.For a while the enemy came thick and fast; but no matter, the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came in reach.The king’s spirits rose, his joy was limitless.He said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful night, for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the whole country-side."
"可是，那群暴民很快也得出了这个结论；因此他们停止了进攻，开始讨论制定其他方案。他们没有武器，可是满地都是石头，也许能派上用场。我们倒也不反对。　也许偶尔能有那么一半块石头会打到我们，不过不大可能；有树枝树叶把我们挡得严严实实，无论从哪个角度瞄准也看不到我们。　他们要是扔石头扔上半小时，夜幕就会降临来帮忙了。我们此时感觉很是得意。我们可以笑了，几乎能开怀大笑。","However, the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves; wherefore they called off the assault and began to debate other plans.They had no weapons, but there were plenty of stones, and stones might answer.We had no objections.A stone might possibly penetrate to us once in a while, but it wasn’t very likely; we were well protected by boughs and foliage, and were not visible from any good aiming point.If they would but waste half an hour in stonethrowing, the dark would come to our help.We were feeling very well satisfied.We could smile; almost laugh."
"可是我们没笑；幸亏没笑，因为笑了也要被打断了。石头从树叶间呼啸而过，又从树干上弹了回去，可这情形持续了还不到一刻钟，我们就闻到了一股气味。只要闻几下就知道怎么回事了——是烟！这下我们完蛋了。　我们意识到了这点。只要烟来请你，不动身也不行。他们把干柴湿草越堆越高，看到浓烟滚滚把树都罩住了，他们发出了阵阵雷鸣般的欢呼。我好不容易喘了口气，说：","But we didn’t; which was just as well, for we should have been interrupted.Before the stones had been raging through the leaves and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes, we began to notice a smell.A couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation—it was smoke!Our game was up at last.We recognized that.When smoke invites you, you have to come.They raised their pile of dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher, and when they saw the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree, they broke out in a storm of joy-clamors.I got enough breath to say:"
"“请先走吧，陛下，按照礼节我应该随在您身后。”","“Proceed, my liege; after you is manners.”"
"国王喘着气说道：","The king gasped:"
"“随朕下去，然后背靠大树，你占据树干一边，朕在另一边。随后我们就开打。准教他们死得其法，尸堆成山。”","“Follow me down, and then back thyself against one side of the trunk, and leave me the other.Then will we fight.Let each pile his dead according to his own fashion and taste.”"
"说完他连呛带咳地下了树，我紧随其后。国王前脚刚够着地面，我后脚就到了，我们各就各位，开始全力拼杀。顿时喊声震天，乱作一团，拳脚如雨点般落下，直杀得敌我难分，天昏地暗。突然间几个骑马的人冲入了人群，有人大喊道：","Then he descended, barking and coughing, and I followed.I struck the ground an instant after him; we sprang to our appointed places, and began to give and take with all our might.The powwow and racket were prodigious; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and thick-falling blows.Suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of the crowd, and a voice shouted:"
"“住手——否则你们都死定了！”","“Hold—or ye are dead men!”"
"这一声真是太妙了！　发话的人怎么看都像是个绅士：衣着光鲜考究，颐指气使，面色冷峻，只是由于沉湎于酒色而导致肤色面容大为受损。这群暴民如哈巴狗一般，毕恭毕敬地退在一边。这位绅士上下打量了我们一番，随后厉声对那群农民喝道：","How good it sounded!The owner of the voice bore all the marks of a gentleman: picturesque and costly raiment, the aspect of command, a hard countenance, with complexion and features marred by dissipation.The mob fell humbly back, like so many spaniels.The gentleman inspected us critically, then said sharply to the peasants:"
"“尔等对这二人意欲为何？”","“What are ye doing to these people?”"
"“尊敬的大人在上，此二人皆是疯子，不知从何而来，而且——”","“They be madmen, worshipful sir, that have come wandering we know not whence, and—”"
"“不知从何而来？　你们是不是假装不认识他俩？”","“Ye know not whence?Do ye pretend ye know them not?”"
"“最最尊贵的大人，小的所言句句属实。他们确是外乡人，本地无人识得；而且他们凶残无比，嗜血成性，疯疯癫癫，简直是前所未——”","“Most honored sir, we speak but the truth.They are strangers and unknown to any in this region; and they be the most violent and bloodthirsty madmen that ever—”"
"“住嘴！　休得胡言。他们不是疯子。尔等何人？何方人氏？快讲。”","“Peace!Ye know not what ye say.They are not mad.Who are ye?And whence are ye?Explain.”"
"“我们不过是老实巴交的外乡人，大人，”我说到，“出门要办点自己的事。我们远道而来，此地一个人也不认识。我们决无恶意；多亏您挺身而出，出手干预和保护，否则这些人早就将我俩杀死了。大人高见，我等并不是疯子，也不曾凶残无比，嗜血成性。”","“We are but peaceful strangers, sir,” I said, “and traveling upon our own concerns.We are from a far country, and unacquainted here.We have purposed no harm; and yet but for your brave interference and protection these people would have killed us. 　As you have divined, sir, we are not mad; neither are we violent or bloodthirsty.”"
"这位绅士扭头对随从冷冷地说：“用鞭子把这些畜牲都赶回窝里去！”","The gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly: “Lash me these animals to their kennels!”"
"那群暴民立刻就跑得无影无踪了；骑着马的人追赶着他们，挥起鞭子一顿猛揍，有些人没有脑子，不往树丛里钻，继续在大路上跑，结果被无情的马蹄给踩倒了。尖叫声，哀求声，很快消失在远方，不久那些骑马的人也陆陆续续回来了。在此期间，那位绅士一直在盘问我们，问得比刚才还仔细，不过什么也没问出来。承蒙他对我们出手相救，我们自是不胜感激，不过我们没有多透露一点，只说自己是远道而来的外乡人，在此地无亲无友。所有的护卫都回来了，那位绅士对手下一仆人说道：","The mob vanished in an instant; and after them plunged the horsemen, laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the bush.The shrieks and supplications presently died away in the distance, and soon the horsemen began to straggle back.Meantime the gentleman had been questioning us more closely, but had dug no particulars out of us.We were lavish of recognition of the service he was doing us, but we revealed nothing more than that we were friendless strangers from a far country.When the escort were all returned, the gentleman said to one of his servants:"
"“把那两匹没人骑的马牵来，给这两人骑上。”","“Bring the led-horses and mount these people.”"
"“遵命，大人。”","“Yes, my lord.”"
"我们被安排和那些仆人一起走在后面。　我们行进得很快，天刚黑不一会儿我们在路边一个小客栈勒住了马，此地离刚才出事的地方有十一二里远了。那位大人在点了晚饭后径直去了自己的房间，此后我们再也没见到他。第二天一大早，我们就用过早饭准备出发了。　","We were placed toward the rear, among the servants.We traveled pretty fast, and finally drew rein some time after dark at a roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our troubles.My lord went immediately to his room, after ordering his supper, and we saw no more of him.At dawn in the morning we breakfasted and made ready to start."
"此时那位大人为首的侍者慢悠悠踱着步过来了，懒洋洋地说道：","My lord’s chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with indolent grace, and said:"
"“你二人说要沿着这条路继续前行，正好我们同路；因此我家大人，葛利普伯爵下令，你等可继续骑马走，派我等随你们一同走，直送到二十里外一个名叫坎班纳特的集镇，那时你们就脱险了。”","“Ye have said ye should continue upon this road, which is our direction likewise; wherefore my lord, the earl Grip, hath given commandment that ye retain the horses and ride, and that certain of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight Cambenet, whenso ye shall be out of peril.”"
"我们别无选择，只好接受这份美意，还要千恩万谢。我们一行六人溜溜达达，不紧不慢，悠哉游哉地往前走着，交谈中得知那位葛利普大人在本乡本土还是位了不起的大人物呢，过了堪班纳特走一天的路就是他的地盘了。我们老这么晃晃荡荡地走，都快半上午了才走到了那个城镇的集市广场。我们下得马来，请他们再次代我们感谢那位大人，随后就走向广场中心，那儿聚集了一大群人，我俩想瞧瞧是什么这么让大家感兴趣。原来是先前那队奴隶，经过了长途跋涉卖剩下的！也就是说这么长时间以来，他们就一直拖着那些铁链子到处走。那位可怜的丈夫，还有其他许多人都不见了，队伍里又添了几个新买的奴隶。国王对此不感兴趣，想要继续往前走，不过我却被吸引住了，满怀同情。我无法把眼睛从这些人身上挪开，他们精疲力尽，瘦骨嶙峋，简直都没人形了。　他们坐在那儿，在地上瘫成一团，一言不发，没有抱怨，只是耷拉着脑袋，看上去可怜极了。就在离他们不到三十步远的地方，有那么一个蹩脚的演说家，正在对着另一群人发表演讲，正厚颜无耻地鼓吹“属于我们辉煌的英国的自由”，两相对照，令人作呕！","We could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the offer.We jogged along, six in the party, at a moderate and comfortable gait, and in conversation learned that my lord Grip was a very great personage in his own region, which lay a day’s journey beyond Cambenet.We loitered to such a degree that it was near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square of the town.We dismounted, and left our thanks once more for my lord, and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square, to see what might be the object of interest.It was the remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves!So they had been dragging their chains about, all this weary time.That poor husband was gone, and also many others; and some few purchases had been added to the gang.The king was not interested, and wanted to move along, but I was absorbed, and full of pity.I could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity.There they sat, grounded upon the ground, silent, uncomplaining, with bowed heads, a pathetic sight.And by hideous contrast, a redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away, in fulsome laudation of “our glorious British liberties!”"
"我不由得怒火翻腾。我已经忘记了自己的平民身份，只记得自己是个人。不管付出什么代价，我都要登上台子——","I was boiling.I had forgotten I was a plebeian, I was remembering I was a man.Cost what it might, I would mount that rostrum and—"
"咔哒！　国王和我被铐在了一起！　正是我们的伙伴，那几个仆人干的，那位大人葛利普在一旁看着。国王勃然大怒，喊道：","Click!The king and I were handcuffed together!Our companions, those servants, had done it; my lord Grip stood looking on. 　The king burst out in a fury, and said:"
"“不得无礼！开什么玩笑？”","“What meaneth this ill-mannered jest?”"
"那位大人只不过冷冷地对为首的那个恶棍说：","My lord merely said to his head miscreant, coolly:"
"“把这两个奴隶拉去卖掉！”","“Put up the slaves and sell them!”"
"奴隶！　这个词听起来与以往不同——可怕得无法形容！国王举起手铐，用力往下一砸；可是还没等砸到那位大人就躲到了一边。随即一下子跳上来十几个那恶棍的家仆，转眼间我们就一筹莫展，手都被绑到了身后。　我们大声疾呼，非常恳切地声称我们都是自由人，这下把刚才那位满嘴自由的演说家和他那群爱国人士都吸引了过来，他们围着我俩，态度十分坚决。演说家讲道：","SLAVES!The word had a new sound—and how unspeakably awful!The king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force; but my lord was out of the way when they arrived.A dozen of the rascal’s servants sprang forward, and in a moment we were helpless, with our hands bound behind us.We so loudly and so earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen, that we got the interested attention of that liberty-mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd, and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude.The orator said:"
"“若你们真的是自由人，你们就没有理由害怕——大不列颠那上帝赐予的自由与你们同在，会保佑你们的！（掌声。）你们很快就能明白。拿出证据来。”","“If, indeed, ye are freemen, ye have nought to fear—the God-given liberties of Britain are about ye for your shield and shelter!(Applause.)Ye shall soon see.Bring forth your proofs.”"
"“什么证据？”","“What proofs?”"
"“证明你们是自由人的证据。”","“Proof that ye are freemen.”"
"啊呀——我想起来了！　我醒悟了过来，一句话也不说了。可是国王却大发雷霆，大吼道：","Ah—I remembered!I came to myself; I said nothing.But the king stormed out:"
"“你们这些家伙脑子都有病。让这等贼子恶棍来证明我们不是自由人，岂不是更妙，更合情理。”","“Thou’rt insane, man.　It were better, and more in reason, that this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are NOT freemen.”"
"你瞧，对于他自己制定的法律，国王所知一点不比其他人知道得少；不过只是就文字而不是效果而言。当你要把它们应用到自己身上时，这些文字就有了意义，活生生的意义。","You see, he knew his own laws just as other people so often know the laws; by words, not by effects.They take a MEANING, and get to be very vivid, when you come to apply them to yourself."
"所有人都晃着脑袋，看起来很失望；有些人失去了兴趣，转身走开了。那位演说家又开口了——这次是就事论事的语气，不带感情色彩：","All hands shook their heads and looked disappointed; some turned away, no longer interested.The orator said—and this time in the tones of business, not of sentiment:"
"“你们要是不懂得自己国家的法律，现在就该学习学习。你们都是外乡人，这点你们不会否认吧。你们也许是自由人，这点我们也无法否认，可是你们也可能是奴隶。法律规定得很清楚：原告无需证明你们是奴隶，你们需要证明自己不是奴隶。”","“An ye do not know your country’s laws, it were time ye learned them.Ye are strangers to us; ye will not deny that.Ye may be freemen, we do not deny that; but also ye may be slaves.The law is clear: it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves, it requireth you to prove ye are not.”"
"我说道：","I said:"
"“亲爱的先生，只需稍给我们点时间，派人去阿斯托勒特，或是去圣洁谷打听打听——”","“Dear sir, give us only time to send to Astolat; or give us only time to send to the Valley of Holiness—”"
"“住嘴吧，好伙计，这等要求乃非分之想，休得奢望能有人应允。这样不仅耗费时间，还会给你们的主人带来不必要的麻烦——”","“Peace, good man, these are extraordinary requests, and you may not hope to have them granted.It would cost much time, and would unwarrantably inconvenience your master—”"
"“主人？白痴！”国王怒吼道，“我没有主人，我就是自己的主——”","“MASTER, idiot!” stormed the king.“I have no master, I myself am the m—”"
"“别说了，看在上帝的份上！”","“Silence, for God’s sake!”"
"我及时出言阻止了国王。我们现在的情形已经够麻烦了，要是再让这些人认为我们是疯子，对我们也没有任何好处。","I got the words out in time to stop the king.We were in trouble enough already; it could not help us any to give these people the notion that we were lunatics."
"详细情形毋庸赘言。那位伯爵把我们推上台去，拍卖掉了。这条该死的法律，在我自己那个时代，也就是一千三百多年后，在南方也曾存在过；依照这条法律，成百成百的自由人因为无法证明自己是自由人，都被卖为终生的奴隶，这种情形却没有给我留下任何特殊的印象；然而当我亲身体验了这条微不足道的法律和拍卖台时，一件本来只是有点不妥的事情现在却突然变得如地狱般可怕。唉，我们生性就是如此呀。","There is no use in stringing out the details.The earl put us up and sold us at auction.This same infernal law had existed in our own South in my own time, more than thirteen hundred years later, and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without the circumstance making any particular impression upon me; but the minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience, a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly hellish.Well, that’s the way we are made."
"是的，我们被拍卖掉了，像两头母猪一样。要是在大城镇，买卖比较兴隆，我们也许能卖个好价钱；可是这个地方极其萧条，因此我们卖出的价钱每次想起来都让自己感到羞耻，英国的一国之君卖了七元，而他的首相则卖了九元；可是国王应该很容易就能卖出十二元的价钱，我随便也值十五元。不过事情一贯如此，如果市场疲软时你非要卖出，我不管你卖的是什么，你准卖不出好价钱，这事你还是认了吧。如果这位伯爵有足够的头脑——","Yes, we were sold at auction, like swine.In a big town and an active market we should have brought a good price; but this place was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed, every time I think of it. 　The King of England brought seven dollars, and his prime minister nine; whereas the king was easily worth twelve dollars and I as easily worth fifteen.But that is the way things always go; if you force a sale on a dull market, I don’t care what the property is, you are going to make a poor business of it, and you can make up your mind to it. 　If the earl had had wit enough to—"
"不过，现在可不是我替他操心的时候。目前就由他去吧，我可以说是看透他了。","However, there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up on his account.Let him go, for the present; I took his number, so to speak."
"奴隶贩子把我俩都买了下来，用他条长链子把我俩都拴上，我们就成了那支队伍尾部的两员。正午时分，我们继续沿着行军路线前行，离开了坎班纳特；有件事让我觉得有种说不出的怪异，英国的国王和他的首相，戴着脚镣手铐，被人管制着，行走在奴隶护送队中，路过各式各样的闲散男女，头顶的窗户上还坐着美女佳人，可是没有一人投以好奇的目光，也没有人评论上一句话。哎呀，哎呀，这只能证明，归根结底，国王比起乞丐来也没神圣到哪里去。如果你不知道他是国王，他就只是个一钱不值、徒有虚名的货色。可是一把身分亮出来，啊呀老天爷，瞅一眼就能吓得你气儿都不敢出。我琢磨着，我们都是傻瓜蛋。　天生就是，毫无疑问。","The slave-dealer bought us both, and hitched us onto that long chain of his, and we constituted the rear of his procession.We took up our line of march and passed out of Cambenet at noon; and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the King of England and his chief minister, marching manacled and fettered and yoked, in a slave convoy, could move by all manner of idle men and women, and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely, and yet never attract a curious eye, never provoke a single remark.Dear, dear, it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king than there is about a tramp, after all.He is just a cheap and hollow artificiality when you don’t know he is a king.But reveal his quality, and dear me it takes your very breath away to look at him. 　I reckon we are all fools.Born so, no doubt."
"第三十五章　令人心酸的意外事件","CHAPTER 35 A Pitiful Incident"
"世上之事无奇不有。国王闷闷不乐，这也没什么可奇怪的。你会说，他为什么闷闷不乐呢？唉，当然是为了他那不同凡响的陨落了——从世上最高点跌落到了最低点；从世上最耀眼的地位跌落到最默默无闻的地位；从人类最荣耀的职业跌落到最卑微的职业。不是，我敢发誓，最让他恼怒的，首当其冲肯定不是这个，而是他被卖出的那个价钱！　他似乎怎么也过不了七块钱这个坎儿。嗯，我刚发现这点时大吃一惊，简直不能相信，这太不合情理了。不过我脑子一清醒，清楚地审视一番之后，我就明白我错了，这很合情理。原因如下：国王本来只不过是人造出来的东西，因此一个国王的感情，就像一个机器娃娃的动作，都是人造的；不过作为一个人，他是真实存在的，他作为人的感情也是真实的，而不是幻影。一个普通人也会因为别人对自己估价过低而感到丢脸，而国王也不比普通人强到哪儿去，没准还不如普通人呢。","IT’S a world of surprises.The king brooded; this was natural.What would he brood about, should you say?Why, about the prodigious nature of his fall, of course—from the loftiest place in the world to the lowest; from the most illustrious station in the world to the obscurest; from the grandest vocation among men to the basest.No, I take my oath that the thing that graveled him most, to start with, was not this, but the price he had fetched!He couldn’t seem to get over that seven dollars.Well, it stunned me so, when I first found it out, that I couldn’t believe it; it didn’t seem natural.But as soon as my mental sight cleared and I got a right focus on it, I saw I was mistaken; it WAS natural.For this reason: a king is a mere artificiality, and so a king’s feelings, like the impulses of an automatic doll, are mere artificialities; but as a man, he is a reality, and his feelings, as a man, are real, not phantoms.It shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his worth, and the king certainly wasn’t anything more than an average man, if he was up that high."
"去他妈的，他一个劲儿地用各种论点来证明，在公平交易的市场里他一定能卖出二十五元——明摆着就是胡说八道，赤裸裸的狂妄自大；我自己都不值那么多钱。不过我可不想硬跟他争论。实际上，我只能避开争论而来点外交手腕。我不得不把良心抛到一边，厚着脸皮承认他是应该能卖到二十五元的；可是我心里很清楚，无论在哪个时代，世上从没有一个国王能值这一半的钱，而在接下来的一千三百年里，连值这价四分之一的都没有一个。是的，他把我烦死了。如果他开口谈谈庄稼啦，或是最近的天气啦，或是政局啦，哪怕是谈谈狗呀猫呀，道德啦，神学啦——无论谈点什么——我都会叹气，因为我知道接下来会是什么，他总会借此缓解一下那烦死人的七元钱买卖。只要我们在人多的地方停下来，他就会看我一眼，那意思很明显：“如果这事现在从头再来一次，换作这帮人，你就能看到不同的结果了。”唉，他刚一被卖的时候，见他被卖了七元钱，我还偷偷笑他来着；可是看到他满头大汗，操心上火，我真希望他当初是卖了一百元。这事看来是不可能有个了结了，因为每天，无论在什么地方，那些可能买我们的买主都会把我俩上下打量一番，他们对于国王的评论大致都是这样：","Confound him, he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars, sure—a thing which was plainly nonsense, and full or the baldest conceit; I wasn’t worth it myself.But it was tender ground for me to argue on.In fact, I had to simply shirk argument and do the diplomatic instead.I had to throw conscience aside, and brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars; whereas I was quite well aware that in all the ages, the world had never seen a king that was worth half the money, and during the next thirteen centuries wouldn’t see one that was worth the fourth of it.Yes, he tired me.If he began to talk about the crops; or about the recent weather; or about the condition of politics; or about dogs, or cats, or morals, or theology—no matter what—I sighed, for I knew what was coming; he was going to get out of it a palliation of that tiresome seven-dollar sale.Wherever we halted where there was a crowd, he would give me a look which said plainly: “if that thing could be tried over again now, with this kind of folk, you would see a different result.” 　Well, when he was first sold, it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven dollars; but before he was done with his sweating and worrying I wished he had fetched a hundred.The thing never got a chance to die, for every day, at one place or another, possible purchasers looked us over, and, as often as any other way, their comment on the king was something like this:"
"“这个值两块半的傻大个倒有着值三十块的派头。可惜了，这派头却卖不出去。”","“Here’s a two-dollar-and-a-half chump with a thirtydollar style.Pity but style was marketable.”"
"最终这等评论结出了恶果。我们的主人是个讲究实际的人，他觉得要想给国王找个买主，就必须改掉这个缺点。　于是他就开始着手改掉这位真命天子的那份派头。我本来可以给这家伙提点宝贵建议，可是我没那么做；除非你想摧毁自己所拥护的事业，否则就不要自告奋勇给奴隶主提什么建议。我发现，要把国王的派头降低到农民的派头，即使国王自己乐意学，急于要学，也是件困难十足的工作；好嘛，要把国王的派头降低到奴隶的派头——还得用强制手段——去他的！　这可真是工程浩大。细节就不必在意了——我还是省省事，由你自己去想象吧。我只想说一件事，一周之后，有充分的证据证明，皮鞭、棍棒和拳头的效果不错；国王的身体有够瞧的——让人掉眼泪；可是至于他的精神呢？——唉，没一点改变。就连那个迟钝的傻瓜奴隶贩子都看得出来，世上真有这种奴隶，宁死也要做人；你可以打断他的骨头，但打不碎他的男子汉精神。这家伙发现，从一开始的努力直到最后，他都近不了国王的身，而国王却随时准备扑向他，还真做到过。所以末了他只得放弃，任由国王保持自己的派头，毫发无损。事实上，国王不止是个国王，他还是个人；而当人还是人的时候，任你怎么折腾他也还是个人。","At last this sort of remark produced an evil result.Our owner was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king.So he went to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty.I could have given the man some valuable advice, but I didn’t; you mustn’t volunteer advice to a slave-driver unless you want to damage the cause you are arguing for.I had found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the king’s style to a peasant’s style, even when he was a willing and anxious pupil; now then, to undertake to reduce the king’s style to a slave’s style—and by force—go to!It was a stately contract.Never mind the details—it will save me trouble to let you imagine them.I will only remark that at the end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist had done their work well; the king’s body was a sight to see—and to weep over; but his spirit?—why, it wasn’t even phased.Even that dull clod of a slave-driver was able to see that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man till he dies; whose bones you can break, but whose manhood you can’t.This man found that from his first effort down to his latest, he couldn’t ever come within reach of the king, but the king was ready to plunge for him, and did it.So he gave up at last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired.The fact is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he was a man; and when a man is a man, you can’t knock it out of him."
"这一个月我们吃尽苦头，在世间来回跋涉，遭受磨难。而此时哪位英国佬对奴隶制问题最感兴趣呢？　正是国王陛下本人！　一点没错，他原本对此最漠不关心，如今却变成最感兴趣了。我从未见过像他这么痛恨这个制度的人。多年前我曾经问过一个问题，得到的回答却尖锐无比，以至于我觉得还是当心点，不要多管闲事了，此时我壮起胆子把这个问题又提了出来。他会废除奴隶制吗？","We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth, and suffering.And what Englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time?His grace the king!Yes; from being the most indifferent, he was become the most interested.He was become the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever heard talk.And so I ventured to ask once more a question which I had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further.Would he abolish slavery?"
"他的回答还是和以前一样尖厉，不过这次听起来却仿佛音乐一般；我听了之后无比开心，尽管那些诅咒发誓实在不怎么地，都是生拼硬凑，那些本该放在句末的感叹词几乎都出现在正当中。　","His answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time; I shouldn’t ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanity was not good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word almost in the middle instead of at the end, where, of course, it ought to have been."
"我已经准备好了，巴不得现在就逃出去，我从没想过要这么快就逃出去。不，这样说也不全对。我也曾想过，只不过没想过要不顾一切，而且还把国王同样的念头给打消了。　可是如今——啊呀，情况不一样了！　无论付出多大的代价，自由都是值得争取的。我制定了一个方案，并且马上就对它着迷了。　不错，这个方案需要大量的时间和耐心。更快捷的方法也不是想不出来，而且一样有把握；可是没有一个能和这个这样活灵活现，富有戏剧性。因此我不打算放弃这个方案。也许它会耽误我们好几个月的时间，不过没关系，我一定会执行到底，不然就搞砸了。","I was ready and willing to get free now; I hadn’t wanted to get free any sooner.No, I cannot quite say that.I had wanted to, but I had not been willing to take desperate chances, and had always dissuaded the king from them.But now—ah, it was a new atmosphere!Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now.I set about a plan, and was straightway charmed with it.It would require time, yes, and patience, too, a great deal of both.One could invent quicker ways, and fully as sure ones; but none that would be as picturesque as this; none that could be made so dramatic.And so I was not going to give this one up.　It might delay us months, but no matter, I would carry it out or break something."
"我们时不时就会遇险。一天晚上，我们遇上了暴风雪，当时离我们要去的村子还有一里地。几乎眨眼之间我们就像被浓雾罩住了一样，漫天飞雪遮天蔽日。什么也看不见了，我们很快就迷失了方向。奴隶贩子拼命地拿鞭子抽我们，因为他看出自己就要破产了，可是他的鞭打只能让情况变得更糟，这样一来就把我们赶得离大路越来越远，得救的可能性也就越来越小了。所以最后我们不得不停了下来，倒在雪地里。暴风雪一直持续到半夜才停住。截止此时，已有两个身体较弱的男奴隶和三个女奴隶死掉了，其他的也都动弹不得，离死不远了。我们的主人已经快发疯了。他把那些还活着的人都鼓动起来，让我们站起来，跳一跳，拍打拍打身子，好让血液重新循环起来，他还极力用鞭子来帮我们的忙。","Now and then we had an adventure.One night we were overtaken by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for.Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving snow was so thick.You couldn’t see a thing, and we were soon lost.The slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin before him, but his lashings only made matters worse, for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor.So we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we were.The storm continued until toward midnight, then ceased.By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead, and others past moving and threatened with death.Our master was nearly beside himself.He stirred up the living, and made us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our circulation, and he helped as well as he could with his whip."
"此时发生的一件事转移了我们的注意力。我们听到阵阵尖叫狂喊，不久一个女人边哭边朝这边跑过来；一见到我们这群人，她就朝我们当中扑了过来，乞求保护。一群暴民紧跟在她身后跑了过来，有的手里还举着火把，他们说她是个女巫，在化身成一只黑猫的魔鬼帮助下施行法术，搞得好几头牛都得怪病死掉了。这个可怜的女人被人用石头砸得都没有人形了，浑身是伤，血迹斑斑。这群暴民还要烧死她。　","Now came a diversion.We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a woman came running and crying; and seeing our group, she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection.A mob of people came tearing after her, some with torches, and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease, and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat. 　　This poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human, she was so battered and bloody.The mob wanted to burn her."
"嗯，好吧，你猜我们的主人是怎么做的？我们刚把这可怜的家伙围起来要保护她，他就看出自己的机会来了。他说要么就地烧死她，要么谁也别想把她弄走。谁能想得到！　他们都乐意。他们把她绑到了一根柱子上，然后拿些木柴堆在她周围，用火把点上，此时她把两个年幼的女儿都搂在胸前，尖叫着，苦苦哀求着；而我们那个禽兽，一心只想赚钱，用鞭子抽打我们，把我们赶到那根柱子旁，好让那堆火把我们烤暖和了活过来，保住我们的商业价值；也正是这堆火，把那可怜的无辜的母亲给活活烧死了。我们的主人就是这样的人。我算是把他看透了。那场暴风雪断送了他九个奴隶；此后他对我们比以往更加残忍了，因为好多天来他都对自己的损失狂怒不已。","Well, now, what do you suppose our master did?When we closed around this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance.He said, burn her here, or they shouldn’t have her at all. 　Imagine that!They were willing.They fastened her to a post; they brought wood and piled it about her; they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast; and our brute, with a heart solely for business, lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother.That was the sort of master we had. 　I took HIS number.That snow-storm cost him nine of his flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for many days together, he was so enraged over his loss."
"一路上险事不断。一天，我们碰到了一支行进的队伍。这是怎样一支队伍呀！　它几乎囊括了全国所有的地痞流氓加酒鬼。前面是一辆货车，拉着一个棺材，棺材上坐着一个年轻漂亮的姑娘，十八岁上下，还奶着一个孩子，她隔一会儿就满怀怜爱地把它往胸前搂搂，眼睛里溢出的泪水如雨滴般落到孩子脸上，再隔一会儿就擦擦；而那个傻呼呼的小东西总是仰脸冲她笑，快乐而满足，用它那长着小肉窝的胖手按按她的乳房，而她心都碎了却还要把这小手拍了又拍，摸了又摸。","We had adventures all along.One day we ran into a procession.And such a procession!All the riffraff of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it; and all drunk at that.In the van was a cart with a coffin in it, and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby, which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while, and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her, happy and content, kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand, which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart."
"男男女女，姑娘小伙，在这辆车旁或车后快步走着，大喊大笑，嘴里嚷着不干不净猥亵下流的话，唱着一段段淫词艳曲，连蹦带跳，手舞足蹈——这场面仿佛是地狱狂欢，令人作呕。我们已经到了伦敦郊区，到了城墙外了，而这就是伦敦社会的一个缩影。我们的主人给我们在绞刑架附近找了个好位置。到场的有一位牧师，他扶那位姑娘爬了上去，说了几句安慰话，又让那位行刑官给她拿个凳子来。然后他就挨着那个姑娘站在绞刑架上，低头看了一阵子聚集在他脚底下仰着脸的人群，随后又放眼四周，人头密密麻麻，上面简直都可以走人了，四面延伸开来，填满了远近所有的空隙，然后他开始讲述起案情来。他的声音里透着一丝怜悯——在那个无知野蛮的国度里能听到这种声音是多么非比寻常啊！　我记得他讲的每一个细节，不过原话不记得了；所以我就用自己的话讲了：","Men and women, boys and girls, trotted along beside or after the cart, hooting, shouting profane and ribald remarks, singing snatches of foul song, skipping, dancing—a very holiday of hellions, a sickening sight.We had struck a suburb of London, outside the walls, and this was a sample of one sort of London society.Our master secured a good place for us near the gallows.A priest was in attendance, and he helped the girl climb up, and said comforting words to her, and made the under-sheriff provide a stool for her.Then he stood there by her on the gallows, and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet, then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near, and then began to tell the story of the case.And there was pity in his voice—how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land!I remember every detail of what he said, except the words he said it in; and so I change it into my own words:"
"“法律本意为维护公正。有时候也会失败。这也不可避免。　对此我们只能满怀悲痛，听之任之，对那个在法律铁臂下受到不公正对待的灵魂，我们只能为他祈祷，并且祈祷这样的人不要太多。　法律判定这个可怜的小家伙死罪——这没有什么不对。不过正是另一条法律把她推到了如此的地步，要么犯罪，要么就和她的孩子一起饿死——上帝明鉴，她犯了罪，还要死得如此丢人现眼，法律是负有责任的！　","“Law is intended to meet out justice.Sometimes it fails.This cannot be helped.We can only grieve, and be resigned, and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law, and that his fellows may be few.A law sends this poor young thing to death—and it is right.But another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her child—and before God that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death!"
"不久之前，这位年轻的姑娘，十八岁的孩子，还是一位英国随处可见的幸福妻子和母亲；她的唇间总飘荡着幸福的歌声，那是发自内心的快乐与纯真之语。她丈夫和她一样欢乐；因为他尽职尽责，早起上工，晚上做手艺活，每份面包都是清清白白挣来的，生意也越来越兴旺，他让全家人都衣食有靠，他还为国家的财富尽了绵薄之力。可是在一条阴险邪恶的法律纵容之下，飞来横祸降临到了这个圣洁的家庭头上，一切荡然无存！　那位年轻的丈夫在路上被人强行拉走，被强迫出海了。而妻子对此一无所知。她四处找他，她苦苦哀求的泪水，绝望中断断续续的诉说，就连最硬的心肠都被打动了。一个礼拜又一个礼拜地捱着，她望着，等着，盼着，在不幸的负荷下她的精神慢慢地崩溃了。渐渐的，为了活命，她那为数不多的家产都典卖一光。当她无力再付房租时，他们把她赶出了家门。在她还有力气时她就到处乞讨；最后她快饿死了，也没有奶了，她就偷了一块亚麻布，能值四分之一分吧，想要把它卖掉，救救她的孩子。可是她被布的主人发现了。她就被投进了监狱，接受了审判。那人证明一切属实。他又为她求情，把她那不幸的身世讲了一遍。经过批准，她也开口说话了，说她确实偷了那块布，不过那是因为近来烦恼太多，心神俱乱，而且因为饿得不行了，所有的行为不管是不是犯罪，在她脑海里都飘飘忽忽，毫无意义，除了饥饿，她什么都不知道。一时间大家无不为之动容，倾向于对她法外施恩，鉴于她尚且年幼，无依无靠，而且她的案子又如此令人同情，都是那条法律害得她无依无靠，这是她犯罪的头一个也是唯一一个原因；然而检察官却回答说，尽管这些都是实情，无比让人同情，可是这些日子小偷小摸太多，在错误的时机开恩会危及大家的财产——噢，我的上帝呀，难道那些被毁了的家庭，失去父母的婴儿，和那些破碎的心灵就没有英国法律认为是珍贵的财产吗！——因此他一定要法办。","A little while ago this young thing, this child of eighteen years, was as happy a wife and mother as any in England; and her lips were blithe with song, which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts.Her young husband was as happy as she; for he was doing his whole duty, he worked early and late at his handicraft, his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned, he was prospering, he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family, he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation.By consent of a treacherous law, instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away!That young husband was waylaid and impressed, and sent to sea. 　The wife knew nothing of it.She sought him everywhere, she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears, the broken eloquence of her despair.Weeks dragged by, she watching, waiting, hoping, her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery.Little by little all her small possessions went for food.When she could no longer pay her rent, they turned her out of doors.She begged, while she had strength; when she was starving at last, and her milk failing, she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent, thinking to sell it and save her child.But she was seen by the owner of the cloth.She was put in jail and brought to trial.The man testified to the facts.A plea was made for her, and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf.She spoke, too, by permission, and said she did steal the cloth, but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts, criminal or other, swam meaningless through her brain and she knew nothing rightly, except that she was so hungry!For a moment all were touched, and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her, seeing that she was so young and friendless, and her case so piteous, and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true, and most pitiful as well, still there was much small theft in these days, and mistimed mercy here would be a danger to property—oh, my God, is there no property in ruined homes, and orphaned babes, and broken hearts that British law holds precious!—and so he must require sentence."
"“这时法官戴上了黑帽子，被偷那块布的物主哆哆嗦嗦站了起来，嘴唇颤抖，面如死灰；可怕的判词一出，他就大喊起来，‘噢，可怜的孩子，可怜的孩子，我哪里知道是死罪！’随后就跟树一样直挺挺倒下了。等他们把他扶了起来，他已经神志尽失了，太阳还没落山，他就寻了短见。真是个好心肠的人，他打心眼儿里就不是个邪恶的人；把这条人命和眼下就要被害的人命加在一起，该算到谁头上就算到谁头上——就是那些统治者和严酷的英国法律。时辰到了，我的孩子，让我对着你祈祷吧——不是为你，亲爱的孩子，饱受虐待、可怜无辜的孩子，而是为他们，那些害得你家破人亡的有罪之人，他们需要多多的祈祷。”","“When the judge put on his black cap, the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up, his lip quivering, his face as gray as ashes; and when the awful words came, he cried out, ‘Oh, poor child, poor child, I did not know it was death!’ and fell as a tree falls.When they lifted him up his reason was gone; before the sun was set, he had taken his own life.A kindly man; a man whose heart was right, at bottom; add his murder to this that is to be now done here; and charge them both where they belong—to the rulers and the bitter laws of Britain.The time is come, my child; let me pray over thee—not FOR thee, dear abused poor heart and innocent, but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death, who need it more.”"
"他祈祷完了，他们就把绳套套在那姑娘的脖子上，费了好大劲儿才把耳朵下面的绳结调整好，因为她始终像是要把婴儿吞掉似的，疯狂地亲着它，把它紧紧地抓住贴在自己的脸上和胸前，泪水都把它打湿了，从头到尾又是呻吟又是尖叫，而那个婴儿则叫着，笑着，小脚丫欢快地又蹬又踢，还当是逗它玩呢。就连刽子手都不忍心看了，只得转过脸去。一切都准备好了，那位牧师轻轻地连拉带拽，强行把孩子从母亲的臂弯里拿走，快步走到她够不到的地方；可是她紧握着双手，尖叫着，猛地朝他扑了过去；可是被绳子——还有行刑官——给拦住了。随后她扑通跪倒，伸着双手哭喊道：","After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl’s neck, and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear, because she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it, and snatching it to her face and her breast, and drenching it with tears, and half moaning, half shrieking all the while, and the baby crowing, and laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play.Even the hangman couldn’t stand it, but turned away.When all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mother’s arms, and stepped quickly out of her reach; but she clasped her hands, and made a wild spring toward him, with a shriek; but the rope—and the under-sheriff—held her short.Then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried:"
"“让我再亲亲吧——噢，我的上帝，再亲亲，再亲亲吧——看在快死的人份上，求你了！”","“One more kiss—oh, my God, one more, one more,—it is the dying that begs it!”"
"她得到了允许，她差点把那小东西给闷死。而当他们再次把它带走时，她大喊道：","She got it; she almost smothered the little thing.And when they got it away again, she cried out:"
"“噢，我的孩子，我的宝贝，它就要死了！　它没有家，没有爸爸，没有朋友，也没有妈妈——”","“Oh, my child, my darling, it will die!It has no home, it has no father, no friend, no mother—”"
"“这些它都有！”那位好心的牧师说，“这些它都会有的，直到我死了才罢。”","“It has them all!” said that good priest.“All these will I be to it till I die.”"
"此时你真该看看她的脸！　感激？　老天，你以为这是用语言能够形容的吗？　语言不过是画出来的火焰；表情才是火焰的本源。她露出那个表情，然后带着这个表情走了，带到天堂的宝库去了，一切神圣的东西都属于那个地方。","You should have seen her face then!Gratitude? 　Lord, what do you want with words to express that?Words are only painted fire; a look is the fire itself.She gave that look, and carried it away to the treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong."
"第三十六章　黑暗中的遭遇","CHAPTER 36 An Encounter in the Dark"
"伦敦——对于一个奴隶来说——是个相当有趣的地方。它只不过是个大村庄，建筑大都是由泥土和茅草建成的。街上一片泥泞，弯弯曲曲，没有铺石板。那些平民百姓总是成群结队，一群群东游西荡，有的衣衫褴褛，有的锦衣华服，有的盔缨飘飘，甲胄生光。国王在那里有行宫，他如今只能在外面观赏。他不由得唉声叹气，不错，还骂了两句，用公元六世纪那可怜而幼稚的方式。我们看见几位我们认识的骑士和贵族，不过我们穿着破衣烂衫，灰头土脸，满身鞭痕瘀青，他们都不认识我们了，就是我们跟他们打招呼他们也认不出来我们是谁，也不会停下来答话的，因为跟拴在链子上的奴隶讲话是违反法律的。桑迪骑着骡子从我身边不到十码远的地方经过——我想她一定是在找我。可是发生了一件事，真真叫我心碎，这事就发生在我们老营地前面的广场上，当时我们正从头到尾眼睁睁看着一个人因为伪造小额钱币被投入油锅里炸死。就在这时我看到了一个报童——可是我却接近不了他！不过，我还是有点欣慰——这证明克拉伦斯还活着，还在轰轰烈烈地做事。我打算不久之后就和他会合，一想到这点我满心欢喜。","LONDON—to a slave—was a sufficiently interesting place.It was merely a great big village; and mainly mud and thatch.The streets were muddy, crooked, unpaved.The populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes and shining armor.The king had a palace there; he saw the outside of it.It made him sigh; yes, and swear a little, in a poor juvenile sixth century way. 　We saw knights and grandees whom we knew, but they didn’t know us in our rags and dirt and raw welts and bruises, and wouldn’t have recognized us if we had hailed them, nor stopped to answer, either, it being unlawful to speak with slaves on a chain.Sandy passed within ten yards of me on a mule—hunting for me, I imagined.But the thing which clean broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square, while we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies.It was the sight of a newsboy—and I couldn’t get at him!Still, I had one comfort—here was proof that Clarence was still alive and banging away.I meant to be with him before long; the thought was full of cheer."
"一天，我无意间瞥见了另一件东西，使我大为振奋。那是一根从一个屋顶扯到另一个屋顶的电线。毫无疑问，不是电报就是电话的。我真希望我手里有那么一小段。我正需要这个，好让我开展我的出逃方案。我的想法是，趁晚上和国王一同脱身，然后把我们的主人给捆起来，把嘴堵上，和他换了衣服，再把他揍得任谁也认不出来，拴到拴奴隶的链子上，把这份财产据为己有，朝卡米洛进发，还要——","I had one little glimpse of another thing, one day, which gave me a great uplift.It was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop.Telegraph or telephone, sure.I did very much wish I had a little piece of it. 　It was just what I needed, in order to carry out my project of escape.My idea was to get loose some night, along with the king, then gag and bind our master, change clothes with him, batter him into the aspect of a stranger, hitch him to the slave-chain, assume possession of the property, march to Camelot, and—"
"不过你已经明白我的意思了吧，瞧着吧，等我回到王宫后搞出来的那戏剧性的一幕才让人目瞪口呆，啧啧称奇呢。一切都是切实可行的，只要我能搞到一小块铁片，给它做成一把万能钥匙。随后我就能找到时机打开那个锁着我们链子的笨重大锁。可是我一直运气不佳，这东西我一直没碰见。不过，我的机会最终还是来了。　有那么一位绅士，曾两度要买我，却一直未果，或者说离有结果还远着呢，他又来了。我压根儿就没期望能跟了他，因为从当初我成为奴隶到如今，我的要价就高得离谱，总是惹人生气，或遭人奚落，可是我们的主人死挺这个价钱——二十二元。他一分钱都不让。国王倒是大受赞赏，因为他体格健硕，可是他那国王的派头却对他不利，让他卖不出去，没人会想要这种奴隶。我觉得，我过高的价格使得我不可能与他分离。　不，我才不想归刚才提过的那位绅士所有呢，不过我倒希望他的某件东西能最终归我所有，只要他多来看我们几次。　那是钢铁做的，上面有一根长针，是他用来将长外套别在身前的东西。这东西一共有三个。前两次他都让我失望了，因为他离我不够近，使得我的计划实行起来不够安全。不过这次我成功了，我把三个当中最底下那个弄到手了，等他发现不见了时他会以为是丢在路上了。","But you get my idea; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise I would wind up with at the palace.It was all feasible, if I could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could shape into a lock-pick.I could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our chains were fastened, whenever I might choose.But I never had any luck; no such thing ever happened to fall in my way. 　However, my chance came at last.A gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for me, without result, or indeed any approach to a result, came again.I was far from expecting ever to belong to him, for the price asked for me from the time I was first enslaved was exorbitant, and always provoked either anger or derision, yet my master stuck stubbornly to it—twenty-two dollars.He wouldn’t bate a cent.The king was greatly admired, because of his grand physique, but his kingly style was against him, and he wasn’t salable; nobody wanted that kind of a slave.I considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price.No, I was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom I have spoken of, but he had something which I expected would belong to me eventually, if he would but visit us often enough.It was a steel thing with a long pin to it, with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front.There were three of them.He had disappointed me twice, because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe; but this time I succeeded; I captured the lower clasp of the three, and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way."
"我刚有机会高兴了一分钟，悲伤的机会就再次接踵而至了。正当买卖和往常一样就要告吹的时候，主人突然开口了，说了以下这番话——用现代英语就是：","I had a chance to be glad about a minute, then straightway a chance to be sad again.For when the purchase was about to fail, as usual, the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus—in modern English:"
"“我告诉你我要怎么办吧。老是白白供养着这两个家伙，我受够了。给二十二元，这个拿走，另外那个我白搭给你。”","“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. 　I’m tired supporting these two for no good.Give me twenty-two dollars for this one, and I’ll throw the other one in.”"
"国王愤怒得连气都喘不上来了。他这边气凝语噎，那边主人和那位绅士走到一边商量去了。","The king couldn’t get his breath, he was in such a fury.He began to choke and gag, and meantime the master and the gentleman moved away discussing."
"“你这个报价能不能容我考虑考虑——”“最晚到明天这个时辰。”","“An ye will keep the offer open—”“’Tis open till the morrow at this hour.”"
"“那我到时再给你答复。”那位绅士说道，然后就不见了，主人也跟随他一起不见了。","“Then I will answer you at that time,” said the gentleman, and disappeared, the master following him."
"我花了好长时间才让国王冷静下来，不管怎样我总算成功了。我对着他耳语，说了如下几句话：","I had a time of it to cool the king down, but I managed it.I whispered in his ear, to this effect:"
"“陛下此行不会有什么损失的，不过是换个方式罢了。我也是。今晚我们两个都能自由了。”","“Your grace WILL go for nothing, but after another fashion.And so shall I. 　To-night we shall both be free.”"
"“啊呀！　此言怎讲？”","“Ah!How is that?”"
"“今晚，用我偷来的这个东西我就能打开这几把锁，把这些铁链都扔掉。当他九点半左右过来查夜时，我们就抓住他，把他的嘴塞住，揍他一顿，明天一大早我们就成了这群奴隶的所有人，大摇大摆地走出城去。”","“With this thing which I have stolen, I will unlock these locks and cast off these chains to-night.When he comes about nine-thirty to inspect us for the night, we will seize him, gag him, batter him, and early in the morning we will march out of this town, proprietors of this caravan of slaves.”"
"我就说了这么多，不过国王对此很是喜欢，非常满意。那晚我们耐心地等我们那些奴隶伙伴们睡着，要和平日睡着的迹象一致为准，因为还是尽量不要寄希望于这帮家伙。自己的秘密还是保护好为好。毫无疑问他们也没比平常更辗转不宁，可是在我看来却不是这样。在我看来他们离平常那么打鼾总是差着一步。随着时间一点一点过去，我变得有点紧张，害怕剩下的时间不够我们用，于是我就草草试探了几次，结果更耽误事了；因为在黑暗中我只要碰到了挂锁，就免不了会弄得丁当作响，吵醒个把人，他一翻身还不得不吵醒更多的人。","That was as far as I went, but the king was charmed and satisfied.That evening we waited patiently for our fellow-slaves to get to sleep and signify it by the usual sign, for you must not take many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it.It is best to keep your own secrets.No doubt they fidgeted only about as usual, but it didn’t seem so to me.It seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring.As the time dragged on I got nervously afraid we shouldn’t have enough of it left for our needs; so I made several premature attempts, and merely delayed things by it; for I couldn’t seem to touch a padlock, there in the dark, without starting a rattle out of it which interrupted somebody’s sleep and made him turn over and wake some more of the gang."
"不过最终我还是把身上最后一根铁链解了下来，再次成为了自由人。我好好松了口气，把手伸向国王的铁链。太迟了！　主人进来了，一手举着灯，一手拎着他那根沉甸甸的手杖。我紧紧地偎倚着那帮睡得鼾声如雷东倒西歪的家伙们，尽量不让人发现我身上已经没有铁链了，我还密切关注着，只要他朝我一弯腰我就准备跳起来。","But finally I did get my last iron off, and was a free man once more.I took a good breath of relief, and reached for the king’s irons.Too late!In comes the master, with a light in one hand and his heavy walkingstaff in the other.I snuggled close among the wallow of snorers, to conceal as nearly as possible that I was naked of irons; and I kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he should bend over me."
"不过他并没有靠近。他停了一停，漫不经心地朝我们这群黑压压的人看了有一分钟，明显心里在想着别的事情；接着他放下手里的灯，若有所思地朝门口走去，在你还没想明白他接下来要做什么，他已经出了门，把门随后关上了。","But he didn’t approach.He stopped, gazed absently toward our dusky mass a minute, evidently thinking about something else; then set down his light, moved musingly toward the door, and before a body could imagine what he was going to do, he was out of the door and had closed it behind him."
"“快！”国王说，　“把他抓回来！”","“Quick!” said the king.“Fetch him back!”"
"自然，这正是该干的事，我立刻起身出去了。可是，老天，那时候可没有灯，而那天夜又那么黑。不过我还是隐约看见几步开外有个模模糊糊的人影。我冲了过去，朝他身上一扑，紧接着事情可就热闹了！　我俩扭来打去，打成一团，很快就招来了一大群人。　他们对这场混战显示出了极大的兴趣，竭尽所能为我们打气，说真的，就算是他们自己打架，他们也不会比这更开心更热衷了。不久我们身后传来一阵大吵大嚷的声音，那群观众有一半忽地跑开了，跑到那边去凑热闹了。灯笼从四面八方涌了过来，那是远近的守夜人聚集过来了。过了不一会儿，一根画戟架到了我的后背上，这是个提醒，我明白它什么意思。我被捕了。我的对头也不例外。我俩一边一个看守，被押着朝监狱走去。祸从天降，好端端的计划顿时化成了泡影！　我使劲想了想，当主人发现是我和他打架时事情会怎样，如果他们按照惯例，把我俩一起关在普通牢房里，和那些因打架斗殴或犯了轻微罪行的人关在一起，会怎么样——","Of course, it was the thing to do, and I was up and out in a moment.But, dear me, there were no lamps in those days, and it was a dark night.But I glimpsed a dim figure a few steps away.I darted for it, threw myself upon it, and then there was a state of things and lively!We fought and scuffled and struggled, and drew a crowd in no time.They took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they could, and, in fact, couldn’t have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own fight.Then a tremendous row broke out behind us, and as much as half of our audience left us, with a rush, to invest some sympathy in that.Lanterns began to swing in all directions; it was the watch gathering from far and near.Presently a halberd fell across my back, as a reminder, and I knew what it meant.I was in custody.So was my adversary.We were marched off toward prison, one on each side of the watchman.Here was disaster, here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction!I tried to imagine what would happen when the master should discover that it was I who had been fighting him; and what would happen if they jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and petty law-breakers, as was the custom; and what might—"
"正在此时我的对手朝我的方向转过脸来，守夜人手里的洋铁灯笼发出斑斑点点的光，正照在他脸上，噢，老天，我弄错人了！　","Just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction, the freckled light from the watchman’s tin lantern fell on it, and, by George, he was the wrong man!"
"第三十七章　可怕的困境","CHAPTER 37 An Awful Predicament"
"睡觉？　这是不可能的。在那令人恶心的牢房里，那些多如疥癣般的无赖之徒，喝得醉醺醺的，吵吵嚷嚷，唱着歌，要睡觉自然是不可能。再加上我把事情搞砸了，简直让人难以忍受，因此我更急不可耐地要离开这个地方，去看看那个奴隶营地里到底会出什么大乱子，这样一来睡眠就变得更遥不可及了。　","SLEEP?It was impossible.It would naturally have been impossible in that noisome cavern of a jail, with its mangy crowd of drunken, quarrelsome, and song-singing rapscallions.But the thing that made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of, was my racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole size of what might have happened yonder in the slave-quarters in consequence of that intolerable miscarriage of mine."
"这一夜特别漫长，不过黎明最终还是到来了。　我向法庭原原本本从头至尾解释了一通。我说我是个奴隶，是葛利普男爵大人的财产，那位大人昨晚天刚黑就到了河对岸村里的徽章酒店，忽然得了很奇怪的病，并且病得很重，不得已在那里停留了一晚。我奉命赶紧过河去对岸城里把最好的医生找来，我尽力去办，自然是尽我所能飞奔而去了。由于天太黑了，我跟这个普通人撞了个满怀，他一把揪住我的脖子就打，虽然我告诉他我有事要办，而且恳求他看在我的主人的面上，男爵大人危在旦夕——","It was a long night, but the morning got around at last.I made a full and frank explanation to the court.I said I was a slave, the property of the great Earl Grip, who had arrived just after dark at the Tabard inn in the village on the other side of the water, and had stopped there over night, by compulsion, he being taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder.I had been ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best physician; I was doing my best; naturally I was running with all my might; the night was dark, I ran against this common person here, who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me, although I told him my errand, and implored him, for the sake of the great earl my master’s mortal peril—"
"那个普通人突然打断我，说我是一派胡言；他正打算说明我是如何突然冲向他，一言不发就拳打脚踢——","The common person interrupted and said it was a lie; and was going to explain how I rushed upon him and attacked him without a word—"
"“闭嘴，小子！”庭上喝道，“带他下去，给他几鞭子，好让他下次知道该怎样换种方式对待绅士的仆人。退堂！”","“Silence, sirrah!” from the court.“Take him hence and give him a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of a nobleman after a different fashion another time.Go!”"
"接着法官又乞求我的原谅，希望我一定要向我家大人说明，发生这种事情不是法官的过错。我说我定会办妥，然后就告辞了。我告辞的正是时候，他正开口问我为什么我在被捕的时候没有说出实情。我说我要是想到这点肯定早就说了——这个不假——不过当时我被那人揍得脑子都不好用了——等等等等，我抽身走开了，嘴里还在咕哝着。我来不及吃早饭了。我脚下生风地往回跑。很快我就跑回了那个奴隶营地。空无一人——全都撤走了！　就是说，所有人都不见了，除了一具尸体——那位奴隶主人的。它横在地上，被人打成了肉酱，周围的一切都显示出这里曾有一场恶战。门口停着一辆马车，车上放着一口粗糙的木板棺材，工人们在警察的协助下从那些张着大嘴旁观的人群中挤出一条窄路来，好让他们把棺材搬进去。","Then the court begged my pardon, and hoped I would not fail to tell his lordship it was in no wise the court’s fault that this high-handed thing had happened.I said I would make it all right, and so took my leave.Took it just in time, too; he was starting to ask me why I didn’t fetch out these facts the moment I was arrested.I said I would if I had thought of it—which was true—but that I was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked out of me—and so forth and so on, and got myself away, still mumbling.I didn’t wait for breakfast.No grass grew under my feet.I was soon at the slave quarters.Empty—everybody gone!That is, everybody except one body—the slave-master’s.It lay there all battered to pulp; and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight.There was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door, and workmen, assisted by the police, were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in."
"我从中挑了一个身份足够卑微的人，免得人家不屑于屈尊跟我这样衣衫褴褛的人讲话，我跟他打听了事情原委。","I picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk with one so shabby as I, and got his account of the matter."
"“这儿有十六个奴隶。昨天晚上他们造起反来反抗他们的主人，结果如何你都看到了。”","“There were sixteen slaves here.They rose against their master in the night, and thou seest how it ended.”"
"“是的。那是怎么引起的呢？”","“Yes.How did it begin?”"
"“在场的除了那些奴隶，没有一个目击者。他们说有个最值钱的奴隶不知怎么挣脱了锁链跑掉了——定是借助妖术，因为他既无钥匙，锁也不曾打开或有任何损害。当主人发现人不见了，急得发疯，用沉甸甸的大棍朝那群人一顿乱打，他们奋起反抗，拳脚相加，不一会儿就揍得他遍体鳞伤，一命呜呼了。”","“There was no witness but the slaves.They said the slave that was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange way—by magic arts ’twas thought, by reason that he had no key, and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured.When the master discovered his loss, he was mad with despair, and threw himself upon his people with his heavy stick, who resisted and brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him swiftly to his end.”"
"“太可怕了。那些奴隶在审判时下场一定很惨，毫无疑问。”","“This is dreadful.It will go hard with the slaves, no doubt, upon the trial.”"
"“啊呀，审判已经结束了。”","“Marry, the trial is over.”"
"“结束了！”","“Over!”"
"“难道你认为他们要审一个礼拜——就这么简单点事儿？他们用了不到半刻钟就完事了。”","“Would they be a week, think you—and the matter so simple?They were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it.”"
"“噢，我可搞不懂他们如何能在这么短的时间内就确认哪几个有罪。”","“Why, I don’t see how they could determine which were the guilty ones in so short a time.”"
"“哪几个有罪？　千真万确，他们可没想那么细。他们把那帮人全都定了罪。你难道不懂法律吗？——听人说这都是罗马人走时留下的——说如果有一个奴隶杀死了他的主人，那主人手下所有的奴隶都得受死。”","“WHICH ones?Indeed, they considered not particulars like to that.They condemned them in a body.Wit ye not the law?—which men say the Romans left behind them here when they went—that if one slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it.”"
"“不错。我都忘了。那这些人什么时候处死？”","“True.I had forgotten.And when will these die?”"
"“可能是二十四小时之内吧，不过也有人说他们会等上几天，要是他们能找到失踪的那个再一起处决。”","“Belike within a four and twenty hours; albeit some say they will wait a pair of days more, if peradventure they may find the missing one meantime.”"
"失踪的那个！　我听了心里感觉很不舒服。","The missing one!It made me feel uncomfortable."
"“他们能找到他吗？”","“Is it likely they will find him?”"
"“在天黑之前——能吧。他们到处搜寻他。他们站在各个城门口，还带上几个认识他的奴隶，如果他来了就指给他们看，而凡是要出城都要先接受检查。”","“Before the day is spent—yes.　　They seek him everywhere.They stand at the gates of the town, with certain of the slaves who will discover him to them if he cometh, and none can pass out but he will be first examined.”"
"“那其他那些人关押的地方可以看看吗？”","“Might one see the place where the rest are confined?”"
"“外面嘛——可以吧。里面嘛——不过你不会想看里面的。”","“The outside of it—yes. 　The inside of it—but ye will not want to see that.”"
"我把那个监狱的地址记了下来，以备日后查用，然后就信步走开了。走过一条偏僻的小巷，我就在经过的头一间估衣铺买了件粗布衣服，这衣服很适合冷天出海的普通海员穿着，然后我把自己的脸用绷带绑了起来，有人问就说牙疼。这样就把那些最重的伤痕都藏了起来。这是一场大变身。我和之前自己的模样大不相同了。接着我奔向那根电线，找到它之后就顺藤摸瓜来到了它的老窝。那是一间小小的屋子，在一家肉铺的楼上——这说明电报这门行业还不是很兴旺。管事的那个小伙子正趴在桌子上打盹。我把门锁上，把那把大钥匙往怀里一揣。这下把那小伙子吓醒了，他刚要出声，我就说道：","I took the address of that prison for future reference and then sauntered off.At the first second-hand clothing shop I came to, up a back street, I got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be going on a cold voyage, and bound up my face with a liberal bandage, saying I had a toothache.This concealed my worst bruises.It was a transformation.I no longer resembled my former self.Then I struck out for that wire, found it and followed it to its den.It was a little room over a butcher’s shop—which meant that business wasn’t very brisk in the telegraphic line.The young chap in charge was drowsing at his table.I locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom.This alarmed the young fellow, and he was going to make a noise; but I said:"
"“别出声，只要一开口你就死定了。准备好设备。喂，别发呆了！给我叫卡米洛。”","“Save your wind; if you open your mouth you are dead, sure.Tackle your instrument.Lively, now!Call Camelot.”"
"“太让人奇怪了！　你这种人怎么会知道这么多——”","“This doth amaze me!How should such as you know aught of such matters as—”"
"“叫卡米洛！　我现在可是个亡命之徒。叫卡米洛，否则就从机器上滚开，我自己来。”","“Call Camelot!I am a desperate man. 　Call Camelot, or get away from the instrument and I will do it myself.”"
"“什么——你？”","“What—you?”"
"“不错——一点不错。别罗嗦了。给我接王宫。”","“Yes—certainly.Stop gabbling.Call the palace.”"
"他接通了。","He made the call."
"“好啦，叫克拉伦斯。”","“Now, then, call Clarence.”"
"“克拉伦斯姓什么？”","“Clarence WHO?”"
"“不要管克拉伦斯姓什么了。只要说你要找克拉伦斯，就会有人接的。”","“Never mind Clarence who.Say you want Clarence; you’ll get an answer.”"
"他照办了。　我俩神经绷得紧紧的，等了五分钟——十分钟——时间显得多么漫长！——随即咔哒一声响，听起来就跟人的声音一样熟悉，因为克拉伦斯可是我自己教出来的学生。　","He did so. 　We waited five nerve-straining minutes—ten minutes—how long it did seem!—and then came a click that was as familiar to me as a human voice; for Clarence had been my own pupil."
"“喂，小伙子，让地方！我刚才没自己动手，是怕他们也许会认出是我，让你叫比较保险；不过现在没事了。”　","“Now, my lad, vacate!They would have known MY touch, maybe, and so your call was surest; but I’m all right now.”"
"他把地方腾了出来，支楞着耳朵听——不过没听成。我用了密码。我顾不得浪费时间跟克拉伦斯寒暄，而是挺起胸脯，直奔主题——是这样的：","He vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen—but it didn’t win.I used a cipher.I didn’t waste any time in sociabilities with Clarence, but squared away for business, straight-off—thus:"
"“国王在此地，正处于危险之中。我们被抓了起来，当成奴隶给带到了此地。我们无法显露身份——事实上，我连尝试一下的机会都没有。请从王宫往这儿打份能说服他们的电报。”","“The king is here and in danger.We were captured and brought here as slaves.We should not be able to prove our identity—and the fact is, I am not in a position to try.　Send a telegram for the palace here which will carry conviction with it.”"
"他的答复马上就打了回来：","His answer came straight back:"
"“他们对电报这东西一无所知；他们还没有这方面的经验，因为到伦敦的线刚拉上。最好别冒那个险。他们会绞死你的。想想别的招吧。”","“They don’t know anything about the telegraph; they haven’t had any experience yet, the line to London is so new.Better not venture that.They might hang you.Think up something else.”"
"会绞死我们！　他根本不知道自己说得几乎句句都是实情。此刻我什么办法也想不出来。过了一会儿，我突然想到个主意，马上就传了过去：","Might hang us!Little he knew how closely he was crowding the facts.I couldn’t think up anything for the moment.Then an idea struck me, and I started it along:"
"“挑选五百名骑士，派兰斯洛特带队，马上派他们来。让他们从西南门进城，找一个右胳膊上缠块白布的人。”","“Send five hundred picked knights with Launcelot in the lead; and send them on the jump.Let them enter by the southwest gate, and look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm.”"
"回复立马就过来了：","The answer was prompt:"
"“他们半个小时内出发。”","“They shall start in half an hour.”"
"“好的，克拉伦斯，现在告诉这儿的小伙子，我是你的朋友，是你们一伙的；要他务必谨慎，不要把我来这儿的事情透露出去。”","“All right, Clarence; now tell this lad here that I’m a friend of yours and a dead-head; and that he must be discreet and say nothing about this visit of mine.”"
"机器开始跟那个小伙子说话，我急忙离开了。我开始核计。再过半小时就是九点。骑士和马匹都披着重甲，走不了那么快。他们会全力赶路，既然路况不错，没有雪，也不泥泞，他们一个小时大概能走七里路，再加上还得换两次马，他们六点或者稍晚一点能到，那时天还足够亮，他们能看到我右胳膊上绑着的白布，那时我就可以发号施令了。我们会将那个监狱包围，顷刻间就把国王救出来。尽管我还是倾向于时间定在中午，因为那样就更像是场大戏了，不过把方方面面都考虑进来，这样已经够引人注目，够有看头的了。","The instrument began to talk to the youth and I hurried away.I fell to ciphering.In half an hour it would be nine o’clock.Knights and horses in heavy armor couldn’t travel very fast.These would make the best time they could, and now that the ground was in good condition, and no snow or mud, they would probably make a seven-mile gait; they would have to change horses a couple of times; they would arrive about six, or a little after; it would still be plenty light enough; they would see the white cloth which I should tie around my right arm, and I would take command.We would surround that prison and have the king out in no time.It would be showy and picturesque enough, all things considered, though I would have preferred noonday, on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have."
"好啦，为了保险我还有一手准备，我认为自己该找到几个先前我认出来的那些人，叫他们认出我是谁。这样即使不靠那些骑士也能帮我们脱险了。不过我得小心谨慎地进行，因为这可是件有风险的事情。我必须套上华丽的行头，还不能急于一下子套上。不，我得一步一步来，在一个铺子里买套衣服，再跑到离得很远的另一家铺子再买一套，每次换一回漂亮一点，直到最后我全身都是丝绸和天鹅绒，就可以开展我的计划了。于是我行动起来。","Now, then, in order to increase the strings to my bow, I thought I would look up some of those people whom I had formerly recognized, and make myself known.That would help us out of our scrape, without the knights.But I must proceed cautiously, for it was a risky business.I must get into sumptuous raiment, and it wouldn’t do to run and jump into it.No, I must work up to it by degrees, buying suit after suit of clothes, in shops wide apart, and getting a little finer article with each change, until I should finally reach silk and velvet, and be ready for my project.So I started."
"可是计划转眼成了泡影！我刚拐过第一道弯，就迎面碰上了我们那群奴隶中的一个，正跟着一个看守四处窥探。这时我咳嗽了一声，他突然瞅了我一眼，看得我直凉到了心底。我猜他想起来以前听过这样的咳嗽了。我立即转身进了一家店铺，沿着柜台慢慢往里走，边打听价钱边用眼角扫着外面。那两人停住了脚步，一边交谈一边往门里瞧。我决定从后门出去，如果这里有后门的话，于是我就问老板娘我能不能从后门出去，去寻找一个逃跑的奴隶，有人说他就藏在那一带，还说我是个穿便衣的公差，我的同伴就在门口那边，押着那些凶手之一，能不能有劳她走过去告诉他不用等我了，最好能马上赶到后边小巷的那头，等我把那罪犯赶出去，他就迎头拦住。","But the scheme fell through like scat!The first corner I turned, I came plump upon one of our slaves, snooping around with a watchman.I coughed at the moment, and he gave me a sudden look that bit right into my marrow.I judge he thought he had heard that cough before.I turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter, pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye. 　Those people had stopped, and were talking together and looking in at the door.I made up my mind to get out the back way, if there was a back way, and I asked the shopwoman if I could step out there and look for the escaped slave, who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere, and said I was an officer in disguise, and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in charge, and would she be good enough to step there and tell him he needn’t wait, but had better go at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him off when I rousted him out."
"她一听能见到那些早已闻名遐迩的凶犯，顿时心急火燎，两眼放光，马上执行任务去了。我偷偷从后门溜了出去，随手把门锁上，把钥匙放到兜里，拔腿就跑，心里还暗自偷笑，美得不得了。","She was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers, and she started on the errand at once.I slipped out the back way, locked the door behind me, put the key in my pocket and started off, chuckling to myself and comfortable."
"咳，这次我又办砸了，犯了另外一个错误。事实上还是错上加错。要摆脱那个公差，有好多种既简单又可行的方法，可是我都不选，非要挑个独特有趣的，这是我性格上很大一个缺点。而按当时我设定的程序，这位公差既然是人，很自然就会这么做的；然而你越是没料到，那人就越会时不时干点按常理不会干的事情来。在这件事中，这个公差按理该紧跟在我脚后；他会找到一扇笨重的橡树门，严严实实地锁在我俩之间；他还没把门砸开，我应该已经跑得远远的了，忙着一连串地换一套又一套衣服，搞得人眼花缭乱，认不出我是谁，在英国，要想避免那些法律走狗来骚扰，这套衣服要比单靠人品的清白纯洁更为保险。可是那个公差没有按常理出牌，反而听从了我的话，按照指令做了起来。因此，当我信步往那条死胡同外走，对自己的聪明机智正洋洋得意呢，他就拐了过来，我正好自投罗网，被套上了手铐。要是我早知道那是条死胡同——可是，犯了这么愚蠢的错误，还有什么可说的，随它去吧。就把它记在收支帐上吧。","Well, I had gone and spoiled it again, made another mistake.A double one, in fact.There were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device, but no, I must pick out a picturesque one; it is the crying defect of my character.And then, I had ordered my procedure upon what the officer, being human, would NATURALLY do; whereas when you are least expecting it, a man will now and then go and do the very thing which it’s NOT natural for him to do.The natural thing for the officer to do, in this case, was to follow straight on my heels; he would find a stout oaken door, securely locked, between him and me; before he could break it down, I should be far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling law-dogs in Britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity of character.But instead of doing the natural thing, the officer took me at my word, and followed my instructions.And so, as I came trotting out of that cul de sac, full of satisfaction with my own cleverness, he turned the corner and I walked right into his handcuffs.If I had known it was a cul de sac—however, there isn’t any excusing a blunder like that, let it go.Charge it up to profit and loss."
"当然，我满腔愤怒，诅咒发誓说自己是远渡重洋而来，刚上岸不久，所有诸如此类的话——就是为了瞧瞧，你明白啦，看看能不能骗过那个奴隶。可是没奏效。他认识我。随后我责怪他出卖了我。他没有伤心，而是很吃惊。他把眼睛睁得大大地说道：","Of course, I was indignant, and swore I had just come ashore from a long voyage, and all that sort of thing—just to see, you know, if it would deceive that slave.But it didn’t.He knew me. 　Then I reproached him for betraying me. 　He was more surprised than hurt.He stretched his eyes wide, and said:"
"“什么，我们要被绞死，都是你一手造成的，你难道要叫我放了你，不和大家一起受死吗？滚吧！”","“What, wouldst have me let thee, of all men, escape and not hang with us, when thou’rt the very CAUSE of our hanging?Go to!”"
"“滚吧”在他们说来就跟“真可笑！”或是“我喜欢！”一样。那些人说起话来真奇怪。","“Go to” was their way of saying “I should smile!” or “I like that!” 　　Queer talkers, those people."
"唉，他在这件事的看法上还真有点混蛋道理，因此我就把这件事搁下不提了。如果你靠争论不能化解灾祸，争论又有什么好处呢？　这不是我的风格。因此我只是说：","Well, there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case, and so I dropped the matter.When you can’t cure a disaster by argument, what is the use to argue?It isn’t my way. 　So I only said:"
"“你不会被绞死的。我们谁也不会。”","“You’re not going to be hanged.None of us are.”"
"那两个人都笑了，那位奴隶说道：","Both men laughed, and the slave said:"
"你不能算作个傻瓜——之前。你最好能保全自己的名声，鉴于要保持的时间也不会太长了。”","“Ye have not ranked as a fool—before.You might better keep your reputation, seeing the strain would not be for long.”"
"“我觉得会保全的。不用明天我们就能出狱了，而且我们自由了，想去哪儿就去哪儿。”","“It will stand it, I reckon.Before to-morrow we shall be out of prison, and free to go where we will, besides.”"
"那位风趣的公差用大拇指顶顶左耳朵，喉咙里发出刺耳的声音，说道：","The witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb, made a rasping noise in his throat, and said:"
"“出狱——不错——你说得一点不假。你想去哪儿就去哪儿，只不过是游荡在魔鬼陛下那炎热的国土之上。”","“Out of prison—yes—ye say true.And free likewise to go where ye will, so ye wander not out of his grace the Devil’s sultry realm.”"
"我忍住怒火，冷冷地说：","I kept my temper, and said, indifferently:"
"“那么我猜你真认为我们会在一两天内就被绞死了。”","“Now I suppose you really think we are going to hang within a day or two.”"
"“没多少分钟之前我是这么想的，然后事情就定了下来，公之于众了。”","“I thought it not many minutes ago, for so the thing was decided and proclaimed.”"
"“啊，然后你又改变想法了，是不是？”　","“Ah, then you’ve changed your mind, is that it?”"
"“即便这样。那时我只是想到了，如今我知道了。”","“Even that.I only THOUGHT, then; I KNOW, now.”"
"我觉得该挖苦一下，因此就说：","I felt sarcastical, so I said:"
"“噢，圣明的法律公仆，那么能不能屈尊一下，把您知道的都告诉我们。”","“Oh, sapient servant of the law, condescend to tell us, then, what you KNOW.”"
"“你们今天下午过半就会被绞死！　呃嗬！　一下子就回老家了！　靠在我身上。”","“That ye will all be hanged TO-DAY, at mid-afternoon!Oho!  That shot hit home!Lean upon me.”"
"事实上我确实需要找个人靠着。我的骑士们不能及时赶到。他们要晚到三个小时。世上没有什么能够挽救英国国王了，更为要紧的是也挽救不了我。我说更为要紧，不仅仅指我，而是对于整个国家来说——地球上唯一一个万事俱备，马上就要开出文明的花朵的国家。我很不舒服。我不再说话，也没有什么话可说了。我明白这个人的意思，如果那个失踪的奴隶找到了，缓刑就取消了，今天就要行刑。唉，那个失踪的奴隶找到了。","The fact is I did need to lean upon somebody.My knights couldn’t arrive in time.They would be as much as three hours too late.Nothing in the world could save the King of England; nor me, which was more important.More important, not merely to me, but to the nation—the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom into civilization.I was sick.I said no more, there wasn’t anything to say.I knew what the man meant; that if the missing slave was found, the postponement would be revoked, the execution take place to-day.Well, the missing slave was found."
"第三十八章　兰斯洛特爵士和众骑士前来营救","CHAPTER 38 Sir Launcelot and Knights to the Rescue"
"快到下午四点了。刑场就在伦敦城外，城墙根下。天气凉爽宜人，阳光灿烂，再好不过了，这样的天气只会让人想活，而不想死。到场观众多得吓人，一眼望不到头。可是在人群之中我们十五个可怜虫一个朋友也没有。不管你怎么看，一想到这个就会让人心痛。我们坐在那儿，坐在高高的绞刑架上，成了那些充满敌意的人仇恨和嘲笑的靶子。我们被当成了节日的盛景。他们搭了一个大看台，专门为那些带着女眷倾城而出的贵族和绅士而准备。他们当中的许多人我俩都认识。","NEARING four in the afternoon.The scene was just outside the walls of London.A cool, comfortable, superb day, with a brilliant sun; the kind of day to make one want to live, not die.The multitude was prodigious and far-reaching; and yet we fifteen poor devils hadn’t a friend in it.There was something painful in that thought, look at it how you might.There we sat, on our tall scaffold, the butt of the hate and mockery of all those enemies.We were being made a holiday spectacle.They had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry, and these were there in full force, with their ladies.We recognized a good many of them."
"那群人从国王身上找到了乐子，虽然时间不长，不过却出人意料，冲劲十足。我们刚被除去镣铐，他就一跃而起，穿着他那古怪的破衣烂衫，脸上满是伤痕，让人怎么也认不出他是谁，他声称自己就是亚瑟王，英国国王，还宣称若是他那神圣的脑袋上有一根毛发被人动了，在场的每一个人都将以叛国罪被处以严厉的惩罚。那群人爆发出一阵大笑，国王听了吓了一跳，很是意外。这下伤了他的尊严，他闭上嘴再也不说话了。随后，尽管那群人求他继续说下去，为了逗他开口，还发出阵阵尖叫声，嘲笑声，还有人大喊道：","The crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the king.The moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up, in his fantastic rags, with face bruised out of all recognition, and proclaimed himself Arthur, King of Britain, and denounced the awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were touched.It startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter.It wounded his dignity, and he locked himself up in silence.Then, although the crowd begged him to go on, and tried to provoke him to it by catcalls, jeers, and shouts of"
"“让他说话！　国王！　国王！　至贤至圣，衣不蔽体的国王，卑微的臣民正如饥似渴地等着他们的主人开金口吐玉言呢！”","“Let him speak!The king!The king!His humble subjects hunger and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his Serene and Sacred Raggedness!”"
"可是这都没用。他端起国王的架子来，坐在如雨点般落下的挑衅和侮辱之中纹丝不动。他当然有他伟大的一面。我漫不经心地把那条白色绷带拆下来，缠到了右胳膊上。那群人注意到了这点，开始冲着我来了。他们说道：","But it went for nothing.He put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of contempt and insult unmoved.He certainly was great in his way.  Absently, I had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right arm.When the crowd noticed this, they began upon me.　They said:"
"“毫无疑问，这位水手就是他的首相了——瞧那名贵的勋章！”","“Doubtless this sailor-man is his minister—observe his costly badge of office!”"
"我让他们说下去，直到他们说累了，然后我才说道：","I let them go on until they got tired, and then I said:"
"“不错，我就是他的首相，头子大人。明天你们就能从卡米洛那里听说——”","“Yes, I am his minister, The Boss; and to-morrow you will hear that from Camelot which—”"
"我说不下去了。他们用兴高采烈的嘲笑把我淹没了。可是马上就静了下来；因为伦敦的行政司法官们身着官袍，带着他们的属下出来了，引起一阵骚动，说明事情马上就要开场了。在接下来的一阵寂静中，我们的罪行被陈述了一遍，宣读了死刑判决书，随后人人都摘下帽子，听牧师做祷告。","I got no further.They drowned me out with joyous derision.But presently there was silence; for the sheriffs of London, in their official robes, with their subordinates, began to make a stir which indicated that business was about to begin.In the hush which followed, our crime was recited, the death warrant read, then everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer."
"接着一个奴隶被蒙住了眼睛，刽子手放下了绳子。在我们下面就是一条光溜溜的大路，我们在路这端，路那端挤满了狂呼乱叫的观众——路上相当清净，有警察把守，路上没人——要是能看到我那五百骑士一路呼啸而来该多么美妙啊！　可是，唉，根本就没这种可能。　我顺着路延伸的方向向远处望去——路上一个骑士也没有，连个影子都没有。","Then a slave was blindfolded; the hangman unslung his rope.There lay the smooth road below us, we upon one side of it, the banked multitude wailing its other side—a good clear road, and kept free by the police—how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing down it!But no, it was out of the possibilities.I followed its receding thread out into the distance—not a horseman on it, or sign of one."
"绳子突然一拉，那个奴隶就吊起来了，晃来晃去，一边晃着一边吓人地扭动着身子，因为他的四肢并没有被捆起来。","There was a jerk, and the slave hung dangling; dangling and hideously squirming, for his limbs were not tied."
"第二根绳子也松开了，瞬时间另一个奴隶也在晃来晃去了。","A second rope was unslung, in a moment another slave was dangling."
"不出一分钟，第三个奴隶也挣扎在半空了。太可怕了。我扭过了头去，过了一会儿，等我转过头来时我找不到国王了！　　他们正在蒙他的眼睛！　我一下子瘫了，我动弹不得，喉咙也哽住了，舌头也僵住了。他们蒙好了他的眼睛，就把他领到了绳子下面。那种浑身无力的感觉如蛆附骨，我怎么也摆脱不掉。可是当我看到他们把绞索套在他的脖子上时，这一切好像都不存在了，我纵身一跳，上去搭救——就在这个当儿我四处扫了一眼——我的老天！　他们来了，挺着长矛而来！——五百名骑士，全身披挂，骑着自行车来了！","In a minute a third slave was struggling in the air. 　It was dreadful.I turned away my head a moment, and when I turned back I missed the king!They were blindfolding him!I was paralyzed; I couldn’t move, I was choking, my tongue was petrified.They finished blindfolding him, they led him under the rope.I couldn’t shake off that clinging impotence.But when I saw them put the noose around his neck, then everything let go in me and I made a spring to the rescue—and as I made it I shot one more glance abroad—by George!Here they came, a-tilting!—five hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles!"
"这可真是盛况空前。老天，盔缨迎风飘舞，自行车队一眼望不到头，那蛛网般的车轮在阳光下闪闪发光！","The grandest sight that ever was seen.Lord, how the plumes streamed, how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of webby wheels!"
"一见兰斯洛特飞驰而来，我就挥起了右臂——他认出了我那块布——我一把扯下绞索和绷带，大喊道：","I waved my right arm as Launcelot swept in—he recognized my rag—I tore away noose and bandage, and shouted:"
"“都给我跪下，你们这些恶棍，向国王行礼！谁敢不从，就叫他今晚下地狱！”","“On your knees, every rascal of you, and salute the king!Who fails shall sup in hell to-night!”"
"每当我要制造那种高潮的效果时我总是用这种高昂的姿态。瞧，兰斯洛特和那些小伙子们蜂拥而上，把绞刑台上那些行政官之流都扔下台去，看起来真是妙不可言。而那些吓坏了的人群纷纷跪下，求他们刚才还在嘲笑羞辱的国王饶命，看起来也相当不错。国王独自站在那里，还穿着破衣烂衫，接受朝拜，此时我心里暗想，归根结底，国王到底是国王，举手投足之间自有股与众不同的威仪。","I always use that high style when I’m climaxing an effect.Well, it was noble to see Launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard.And it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting.And as he stood apart there, receiving this homage in rags, I thought to myself, well, really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king, after all."
"我十分满意。纵观全局，这算是我平生发起的事件效果最花哨的一次了。","I was immensely satisfied.Take the whole situation all around, it was one of the gaudiest effects I ever instigated."
"不一会儿，克拉伦斯走了过来，不是他是谁！他眨了眨眼，非常摩登地说：","And presently up comes Clarence, his own self!And winks, and says, very modernly:"
"“大吃一惊，是不是？我就知道你喜欢这样。我让那些小伙子偷偷练了好些日子了，简直都等不及找个机会露一手了。”","“Good deal of a surprise, wasn’t it?I knew you’d like it.I’ve had the boys practicing this long time, privately; and just hungry for a chance to show off.”"

"直到比赛那天，英国举国上下谈论的话题只有这场决斗，别无其他。其他话题都变得毫无意义，没人去想，也没人感兴趣。并不是因为比武大赛是件了不起的大事，也不是因为萨格拉摩爵士找到了圣杯，因为他根本没找到，他失败了；也不是因为决斗的一方是国内第二（官方）人物；不，所有的这些特点都太平淡无奇。而这场即将到来的决斗之所以能营造出如此超乎寻常的兴趣，理由倒也是十分充足的。这是基于一个事实，一个举国皆知的事实，可以说这绝不仅仅是两个人之间的决斗，而是两个伟大的魔法师之间的决斗；不是斗蛮力，而是斗智力，不是比人类的技能，而是比超人力的法术与技巧；这是本世纪两位大师级的魔法师之间为了争夺霸权的最终较量。大家都意识到，即使是最有名的骑士所取得的最辉煌的战绩，都不堪与此等盛况相提并论；与这等神秘而可怕的诸神之战相比，那些不过是小孩子的玩艺。不错，全世界都知道，这实际上是默林和我之间的决斗，是我俩各显神通一较高下。众所周知，默林不分昼夜忙着往萨格拉摩爵士的武器和铠甲上灌输神力，使之无坚不摧而又刀枪不入，他还从天上神仙那里为他借来了一张羊毛般的面纱，戴上它之后能让对手看不到他，而其他人还能看到。面对着拥有如此武装和护身的萨格拉摩爵士，就是一千个骑士也拿他无可奈何，世上所有的魔法也战胜不了他。这些事实都是千真万确；人们对于它们没有任何怀疑，也没有理由去怀疑。只有一个问题：会不会还有一种法术，一种默林所不知道的法术，能让我看透萨格拉摩爵士的面纱，能让他那施了魔法的盔甲在我的武器下不再坚不可摧？这是要留到竞技场上见分晓的问题。　在此之前，大家只好悬着这颗心。","Up to the day set, there was no talk in all Britain of anything but this combat.All other topics sank into insignificance and passed out of men’s thoughts and interest.It was not because a tournament was a great matter, it was not because Sir Sagramor had found the Holy Grail, for he had not, but had failed; it was not because the second (official) personage in the kingdom was one of the duellists; no, all these features were commonplace.Yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating.It was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men, so to speak, but a duel between two mighty magicians; a duel not of muscle but of mind, not of human skill but of superhuman art and craft; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master enchanters of the age. 　It was realized that the most prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this; they could be but child’s play, contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods.Yes, all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel between Merlin and me, a measuring of his magic powers against mine.It was known that Merlin had been busy whole days and nights together, imbuing Sir Sagramor’s arms and armor with supernal powers of offense and defense, and that he had procured for him from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other men.Against Sir Sagramor, so weaponed and protected, a thousand knights could accomplish nothing; against him no known enchantments could prevail.These facts were sure; regarding them there was no doubt, no reason for doubt.There was but one question: might there be still other enchantments, UNKNOWN to Merlin, which could render Sir Sagramor’s veil transparent to me, and make his enchanted mail vulnerable to my weapons?This was the one thing to be decided in the lists.Until then the world must remain in suspense."
"因此大家都认为这儿要发生生死攸关的大事了，他们是正确的，不过并不是他们心中所想的那件事。不，还有比这已成定局之事更为重大的：骑士制度的存亡。我是一名斗士，这点不假，不过不是为那轻浮的妖术魔法而战，而是为那坚实的、不带任何感情色彩的常识和理智而战。我进比武场，要么摧毁骑士制度，要么就被它摧毁。","So the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here, and the world was right, but it was not the one they had in their minds.No, a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die: THE LIFE OF KNIGHT-ERRANTRY.I was a champion, it was true, but not the champion of the frivolous black arts, I was the champion of hard unsentimental common-sense and reason.I was entering the lists to either destroy knight-errantry or be its victim."
"十六号上午十点，虽然比武场地很大，但是场外已经连一点空地都没有了。巨大的看台上插满了旗帜、旗幡和色彩艳丽的绣帷，还挤满了那些称臣纳贡的小国君主和他们的随从，还有那些英国贵族，足足占了几公顷；而我们自己的皇室成员占据了主要位置，人人都穿着绚丽耀眼的华丽丝绸或是天鹅绒——哎，除了密西西比河的日落和北极光之间的斗法，我还从没看过一开场就这么好看的较量。另一处好看的景观在比武场的一端，有一座大营，插满了旗帜，支着花花绿绿的帐篷，每个门口都一动不动站着个哨兵，身上挂着亮闪闪的盾牌，随时准备接受挑战。你瞧，只要有点抱负或有点阶级感情的骑士都到场了，既然我对于他们那个阶级的感情也不是什么秘密了，因此他们的机会来了。要是我打赢了萨格拉摩爵士，其他人就有权叫我的号，前提是我愿意应战。","Vast as the show-grounds were, there were no vacant spaces in them outside of the lists, at ten o’clock on the morning of the 16th.The mammoth grand-stand was clothed in flags, streamers, and rich tapestries, and packed with several acres of small-fry tributary kings, their suites, and the British aristocracy; with our own royal gang in the chief place, and each and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvets—well, I never saw anything to begin with it but a fight between an Upper Mississippi sunset and the aurora borealis.The huge camp of beflagged and gaycolored tents at one end of the lists, with a stiffstanding sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for challenge, was another fine sight.You see, every knight was there who had any ambition or any caste feeling; for my feeling toward their order was not much of a secret, and so here was their chance.If I won my fight with Sir Sagramor, others would have the right to call me out as long as I might be willing to respond."
"在我们这端只有两顶帐篷，一顶是我的，一顶是我的仆人的。到了指定的时辰，国王做了个手势，传令官就出现了，身着官服，宣读了决斗者的名字，陈明了争端的缘由。停了一小会儿，接着军号响了起来，这是要我们出场的信号。所有的观众都屏住了呼吸，每个人脸上都闪过了热切而好奇的表情。","Down at our end there were but two tents; one for me, and another for my servants.At the appointed hour the king made a sign, and the heralds, in their tabards, appeared and made proclamation, naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel.There was a pause, then a ringing bugle-blast, which was the signal for us to come forth.All the multitude caught their breath, and an eager curiosity flashed into every face."
"从帐篷内冲出了伟大的萨格拉摩爵士，整个就是座雄伟的黑铁塔，威仪堂堂，刚强不屈，巨大的长矛竖直插在枪托里，攥在他那强有力的手中，他那匹高头大马的脸部和胸部都罩着钢甲，马身裹着色彩绚烂的马饰，几乎都拖到地上了——噢，好一幅高贵的画像。顿时响起了巨大的呼喊声，既是欢迎也是赞美。","Out from his tent rode great Sir Sagramor, an imposing tower of iron, stately and rigid, his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand, his grand horse’s face and breast cased in steel, his body clothed in rich trappings that almost dragged the ground—oh, a most noble picture.A great shout went up, of welcome and admiration."
"紧接着我也出场了。可是我没得到一声欢呼。一阵沉默，意味深长的沉默，大家都在纳闷呢，随后一阵大笑如波浪般横扫过人海，不过受了一声军号的警告，戛然而止了。我穿着最简单最舒适的运动员服装——一身从脖子到脚跟的肉色紧身衣，腰间缀着蓝色丝绸腰带，没戴帽子。我的坐骑个子不过中等，可是非常机灵，细长的腿儿，肌肉跟钟表弹簧一样富有弹性，简直可以充当猎犬使唤。它漂亮极了，像丝绸般光滑，身上除了缰绳和骑马用的马鞍之外光溜溜的，就跟刚出生时一样。","And then out I came.But I didn’t get any shout.There was a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment, then a great wave of laughter began to sweep along that human sea, but a warning bugle-blast cut its career short.I was in the simplest and comfortablest of gymnast costumes—flesh-colored tights from neck to heel, with blue silk puffings about my loins, and bareheaded.My horse was not above medium size, but he was alert, slender-limbed, muscled with watchsprings, and just a greyhound to go.　He was a beauty, glossy as silk, and naked as he was when he was born, except for bridle and ranger-saddle."
"那座铁塔及华丽的被子从比武场那端迈着芭蕾舞步过来了，虽然有点笨重，不过还算优雅，而我们则轻快地迎了上去。我们都停了下来；铁塔冲我行礼，我也回礼了；接着我俩就调转马头，并排骑向大看台，面对国王和王后一一行礼。王后惊呼道：","The iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously but gracefully pirouetting down the lists, and we tripped lightly up to meet them.We halted; the tower saluted, I responded; then we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand-stand and faced our king and queen, to whom we made obeisance.The queen exclaimed:"
"“啊呀，头子大人，你难道要赤身上阵，也不用长矛，不用刀剑，不用——”","“Alack, Sir Boss, wilt fight naked, and without lance or sword or—”"
"可是国王止住了她的话头，用非常客气的三言两语告诉她，这不关她的事。军号又响了起来，我俩分开来，骑马走到比武场的两端，按位置站好。此时老默林出现了，把一张精心织就的薄网往萨格拉摩爵士头上一抛，就把他变成哈姆雷特的幽灵了；国王打了个手势，军号吹响，萨格拉摩爵士将长矛一架，下一秒他就沿着跑道雷鸣电掣般冲了过来，面纱随风飘在脑后，而我则像离弦的箭一样呼啸着迎了上去——一边还支楞着耳朵，就好像不是通过眼睛看，而是通过耳朵听来判断这位隐身骑士的位置和进程似的。一阵喊叫声一齐响了起来，为他打气，还有一个胆大的也为我喊了一句助威——说道：","But the king checked her and made her understand, with a polite phrase or two, that this was none of her business.The bugles rang again; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists, and took position.Now old Merlin stepped into view and cast a dainty web of gossamer threads over Sir Sagramor which turned him into Hamlet’s ghost; the king made a sign, the bugles blew, Sir Sagramor laid his great lance in rest, and the next moment here he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind, and I went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him—cocking my ear the while, as if noting the invisible knight’s position and progress by hearing, not sight.A chorus of encouraging shouts burst out for him, and one brave voice flung out a heartening word for me—said:"
"“上啊，苗条的吉姆！”","“Go it, slim Jim!”"
"有可能是克拉伦斯指使他帮我这个忙——还把那话也教给了他。当那令人生畏的矛尖离我的前胸不过一码半的时候，我把马向旁边一转，没费半点力气，那位大骑士从旁边冲了过去，扑了个空。这次我赢得了大片掌声。我俩转过身来，重整旗鼓，再次交手。那位骑士又扑了个空，而我又赢得了如雷的掌声。同样的事情又重复了一次，引起旋风般的喝彩，萨格拉摩爵士这下可发火了，立刻改变了战术，转为在我身后追击。嗨，他在这方面根本不会出什么风头，这种捉迷藏的游戏，所有的优势都在我这边，每次只要我愿意，就可以轻轻松松地躲开他，还有一次我溜到他后面，从背后拍了他一巴掌。最终我把追赶权掌握到了自己手中；从那以后，他转来扭去，无论怎么做都无法再跑到我身后了；他使尽了招数，却发现自己总是在我前面。于是他放弃了档子事，退到比武场他自己那端。此时他的脾气完全无法控制了，忘记了自己的身份，朝我骂了句难听的话，一下子把我的火也勾上来了。我从鞍桥上取下套索，把它紧紧攥在右手里。这时你真该看看他是怎么过来的！——千真万确，这可不是闹着玩的，从他跑过来的姿势就可以看得出来他是急红了眼了。　我悠闲自在地坐在马上，把那套索的大绳圈在头顶上抡来抡去，抡成大圈。他一出动，我就朝他奔去。当我们之间的距离缩小到四十英尺时，我把盘蛇一样的绳子朝空中一撒，紧接着闪到一边，勒住马头，叫我那训练有素的马儿立刻停住，四蹄站稳，准备出击。霎时间绳子就抖搂起来，一把将萨格拉摩爵士从马鞍上拽了下去！我的老天，瞧瞧是多么轰动呀！","It was an even bet that Clarence had procured that favor for me—and furnished the language, too. 　When that formidable lance-point was within a yard and a half of my breast I twitched my horse aside without an effort, and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank.I got plenty of applause that time.We turned, braced up, and down we came again.Another blank for the knight, a roar of applause for me.This same thing was repeated once more; and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that Sir Sagramor lost his temper, and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down.Why, he hadn’t any show in the world at that; it was a game of tag, with all the advantage on my side; I whirled out of his path with ease whenever I chose, and once I slapped him on the back as I went to the rear.Finally I took the chase into my own hands; and after that, turn, or twist, or do what he would, he was never able to get behind me again; he found himself always in front at the end of his maneuver.So he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists.His temper was clear gone now, and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine.I slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle, and grasped the coil in my right hand.This time you should have seen him come!—it was a business trip, sure; by his gait there was blood in his eye. 　I was sitting my horse at ease, and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head; the moment he was under way, I started for him; when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet, I sent the snaky spirals of the rope a-cleaving through the air, then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge.The next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked Sir Sagramor out of the saddle!Great Scott, but there was a sensation!"
"毋庸置疑，在这个世上新鲜事最受欢迎了。这些人以前从未见识过牛仔的行当，这下可把他们乐得连蹦带跳。四面八方处处响起了这样的喊声：","Unquestionably, the popular thing in this world is novelty.These people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before, and it carried them clear off their feet with delight.From all around and everywhere, the shout went up:"
"“安可！安可！”","“Encore!Encore!”"
"我纳闷他们从哪儿学来的这词，不过此时也没空去想些语言方面的问题，因为整个骑士游侠的大蜂窝正嗡嗡作响，我的生意前景空前的好。套索一解下来，萨格拉摩爵士就被架到他的帐篷里去了，我把抖搂开的绳索收了回来，站在原地，又开始把绳圈在头顶抡来抡去。我敢断定，一旦他们选出来一个接替萨格拉摩的人，我就得用它了，而这花不了多长时间，因为有那么多急巴巴的候选人等着呢。他们的确马上就选出了一个——狂欢的赫维斯爵士。","I wondered where they got the word, but there was no time to cipher on philological matters, because the whole knight-errantry hive was just humming now, and my prospect for trade couldn’t have been better.The moment my lasso was released and Sir Sagramor had been assisted to his tent, I hauled in the slack, took my station and began to swing my loop around my head again.I was sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for Sir Sagramor, and that couldn’t take long where there were so many hungry candidates.Indeed, they elected one straight off—Sir Hervis de Revel."
"噗嗤！ 他过来了，像着了火的房子。我闪到一边：他像闪电般冲了过去，我用那盘马尾绳套套住了他的脖子，也就一两秒钟，唰！他的马鞍上就没人了。","BZZ!Here he came, like a house afire; I dodged: he passed like a flash, with my horse-hair coils settling around his neck; a second or so later, FST!His saddle was empty."
"又有人让我再来一个，又来一个，还来一个，继续来一个。等到我把五个人都拉下了马，那些铁皮人感觉事态有点严重了，就停了下来，凑在一起商议起来。结果呢，他们决定，此时该放下礼节，派他们武艺最高强的出来和我对战。让这个小圈子大吃一惊的是，我将加利的拉莫拉克爵士用套索套了下来，随后又将加拉哈德爵士也如法炮制。所以，你瞧，他们无计可施了，只好打出了他们的王牌——将超级无敌中最超级无敌的，力大无比中最力大无比的，伟大的兰斯洛特爵士本人推了出来！","I got another encore; and another, and another, and still another.When I had snaked five men out, things began to look serious to the ironclads, and they stopped and consulted together.As a result, they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send their greatest and best against me. 　To the astonishment of that little world, I lassoed Sir Lamorak de Galis, and after him Sir Galahad.So you see there was simply nothing to be done now, but play their right bower—bring out the superbest of the superb, the mightiest of the mighty, the great Sir Launcelot himself!"
"此时是不是我该得意一下呢？　按理说本该如此。远处就是英国的一国之君，亚瑟王和桂乃芬王后；不错，还有全体异邦小国的国君们；在那边搭着帐篷的营盘里，有来自各地的知名骑士；同样，还有骑士届赫赫有名的精英，圆桌骑士，在基督教界声名最为显赫；而最显著的事实是，他们光芒四射的体系中那轮太阳正在那边挺着长矛，集四万崇拜的眼神于一身；而这边就我自己一个人，正准备收拾他。我心头突然闪过西哈福德一位接线员姑娘的倩影，此时她要是能瞧见我就好了。正在这时，那位天下无敌的骑士就来了，像旋风一般冲了过来——那些高贵的人士全都站了起来，向前探着身子——夺命的绳套在空中盘旋着，还来不及眨眼，兰斯洛特爵士就仰面朝天被我拖着围着赛场走，此时欢声雷动，挥舞的手帕如暴风骤雨，大家纷纷朝我致意，而我则把手举到嘴边，向他们送吻。","A proud moment for me?I should think so.   Yonder was Arthur, King of Britain; yonder was Guenever; yes, and whole tribes of little provincial kings and kinglets; and in the tented camp yonder, renowned knights from many lands; and likewise the selectest body known to chivalry, the Knights of the Table Round, the most illustrious in Christendom; and biggest fact of all, the very sun of their shining system was yonder couching his lance, the focal point of forty thousand adoring eyes; and all by myself, here was I laying for him.  Across my mind flitted the dear image of a certain hello-girl of West Hartford, and I wished she could see me now. 　In that moment, down came the Invincible, with the rush of a whirlwind—the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward—the fateful coils went circling through the air, and before you could wink I was towing Sir Launcelot across the field on his back, and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and the thunder-crash of applause that greeted me!"
"我将绳索卷起来，挂在鞍桥上，然后坐在那儿，陶醉在胜利之中，心中还暗想：“赢得太彻底了——再没人敢来对抗我了——骑士制度算是完蛋了。”此时想想我有多吃惊吧——别人也一样——当我听到那独特的号角声再次响起，宣告另一位竞争者马上就要进入比武场！这事儿让人摸不着头脑，我说不清到底怎么回事。随后，我注意到默林正从我身边偷偷溜走，接着，我又发现我的套索不见了！肯定是这位手法老练的行家给偷了去，塞到了自己袍子底下。","Said I to myself, as I coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle-horn, and sat there drunk with glory, “The victory is perfect—no other will venture against me—knight-errantry is dead.”　Now imagine my astonishment—and everybody else’s, too—to hear the peculiar bugle-call which announces that another competitor is about to enter the lists!There was a mystery here; I couldn’t account for this thing.Next, I noticed Merlin gliding away from me; and then I noticed that my lasso was gone!The old sleight-of-hand expert had stolen it, sure, and slipped it under his robe."
"号角再次吹响。我放眼一望，萨格拉摩骑着马卷土重来，他身上的尘土都已拍打掉了，面纱也端端正正地重新戴好。我一溜小跑迎上前去，假装只能靠听他的马蹄声来判断他的位置。他说道：","The bugle blew again.I looked, and down came Sagramor riding again, with his dust brushed off and is veil nicely re-arranged.I trotted up to meet him, and pretended to find him by the sound of his horse’s hoofs.He said:"
"“你的耳朵倒是挺好使，不过这次也救不了你了！”说着他碰了碰那柄巨大的宝剑剑柄。　“有了这面纱的作用，可惜你看不到了，不然定教你知道这不是什么笨重的长矛，而是一把宝剑——量你这次断然逃不过它。”","“Thou’rt quick of ear, but it will not save thee from this!” and he touched the hilt of his great sword .“An ye are not able to see it, because of the influence of the veil, know that it is no cumbrous lance, but a sword—and I ween ye will not be able to avoid it.”"
"他的面甲没放下来，你能看得到他笑容里的杀气。很显然，无论如何我都躲不过他手中的宝剑了。这次一定有人要送命了。若是他先发制人，我准知道横尸沙场的是谁。我俩一起骑马上前，向国王王后行礼。这次国王有点不安了。他说道：","His visor was up; there was death in his smile.I should never be able to dodge his sword, that was plain.Somebody was going to die this time.If he got the drop on me, I could name the corpse.We rode forward together, and saluted the royalties.This time the king was disturbed.He said:"
"“你那古怪的武器哪里去了？”","“Where is thy strange weapon?”"
"“被人偷走了，陛下。”","“It is stolen, sire.”"
"“那你身边再没有了吗？”","“Hast another at hand?”"
"“没有了，陛下，我只带了那一件。”","“No, sire, I brought only the one.”"
"此时默林插嘴道：","Then Merlin mixed in:"
"“他只带了这一件是因为仅有一件可带。世上仅此一件。那本是海魔王的宝物。这家伙是个骗子加白痴，否则他早该知道，这件武器只能用八次，然后就消失了，再次回它海底老家去了。”","“He brought but the one because there was but the one to bring.There exists none other but that one.It belongeth to the king of the Demons of the Sea.This man is a pretender, and ignorant, else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts only, and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea.”"
"“那么他就要赤手空拳了，”国王说，“萨格拉摩爵士，你容他去借个吧。”","“Then is he weaponless,” said the king.“Sir Sagramore, ye will grant him leave to borrow.”"
"“我借给他！”兰斯洛特爵士一瘸一拐地走上前来说道，“他身手不凡，勇不可挡，当今骑士无人能出其右，因此他可以用我的武器。”","“And I will lend!” said Sir Launcelot, limping up.  “He is as brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live, and he shall have mine.”"
"他刚要伸手拔剑，萨格拉摩爵士却说道：","He put his hand on his sword to draw it, but Sir Sagramor said:"
"“且慢，这可使不得。他必须用自己的武器来比武，选什么武器带着，那是他的权力。要是出了差错，那就拿命来抵吧。”","“Stay, it may not be.He shall fight with his own weapons; it was his privilege to choose them and bring them.If he has erred, on his head be it.”"
"“骑士呀！”国王说道，“你是不是情绪过于激动，心乱神迷了。你难道连手无寸铁之人都要杀吗？”","“Knight!” said the king.“Thou’rt overwrought with passion; it disorders thy mind.Wouldst kill a naked man?”"
"“他若如此行事，就要跟我说个清楚。”兰斯洛特爵士说道。","“An he do it, he shall answer it to me,” said Sir Launcelot."
"“说个清楚就说个清楚！”萨格拉摩爵士气冲冲地还嘴道。","“I will answer it to any he that desireth!” retorted Sir Sagramor hotly."
"默林搓着手，脸上带着他那最下作的幸灾乐祸的笑容，插嘴说：","Merlin broke in, rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest smile of malicious gratification:"
"“说得好，说得真好！商讨已久，无须多言，请吾王陛下降旨，开始比武吧。”","“‘Tis well said, right well said!And ’tis enough of parleying, let my lord the king deliver the battle signal.”"
"国王只得让步了。号角响起，我们转身离开，骑马走到各自的位置上。我俩就这么站着，相隔一百码，彼此面对面，身体笔直，纹丝不动，就像是骑着马的雕像。于是我们就这么呆了足有一分钟，没人出声，一片寂静，大家都瞪大了眼睛，一动不动。国王看上去似乎不忍心发出号令。不过，他最终还是举起手来，军号那嘹亮的音符接踵而来，萨格拉摩爵士那长长的剑锋在空中划出了闪亮的弧线，冲了过来，威猛之极。我坐在那里没动。他冲过来了。我还是没动。人们都开始激动起来，朝我大喊道：","The king had to yield.The bugle made proclamation, and we turned apart and rode to our stations.There we stood, a hundred yards apart, facing each other, rigid and motionless, like horsed statues.And so we remained, in a soundless hush, as much as a full minute, everybody gazing, nobody stirring.It seemed as if the king could not take heart to give the signal.But at last he lifted his hand, the clear note of the bugle followed, Sir Sagramor’s long blade described a flashing curve in the air, and it was superb to see him come.I sat still.On he came.I did not move.People got so excited that they shouted to me:"
"“快逃，快逃！保命要紧！　这下要杀人了！”","“Fly, fly!Save thyself!This is murther!”"
"我一直寸步不动，直到那滚雷般的幽灵离我不到十五步了，这时我从枪套里掏出一把重骑兵手枪来，只见火光一闪，轰然一响，还没等人弄明白发生了什么事情，我已经把手枪塞回了枪套。","I never budged so much as an inch till that thunderng apparition had got within fifteen paces of me; then I snatched a dragoon revolver out of my holster, there was a flash and a roar, and the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell what had happened."
"没了人骑的马从我身边冲了过去，而萨格拉摩爵士躺在那里，已经死了。","Here was a riderless horse plunging by, and yonder lay Sir Sagramor, stone dead."
"有人跑去一看，吓得呆若木鸡，因为看到他实际上已经断气了，可是却死得不明不白，身上也没受伤，一个伤口都没有。他的锁子甲胸前倒是有个洞，可是他们是不会注意这么点小事的；因为子弹留下的伤口流不了多少血，而且铠甲底下还有衣服和裹着的布，一点血也看不出来。尸体被人拖走了，好去给台上的国王和那些显贵们看看。果不其然，他们也被吓呆了。他们请我过去，将这个神迹说个明白。可是我却呆在原地，像个雕像一样一动不动，说道：","The people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible, no hurt upon his body, nothing like a wound.There was a hole through the breast of his chain-mail, but they attached no importance to a little thing like that; and as a bullet wound there produces but little blood, none came in sight because of the clothing and swaddlings under the armor.The body was dragged over to let the king and the swells look down upon it.They were stupefied with astonishment naturally.I was requested to come and explain the miracle.But I remained in my tracks, like a statue, and said:"
"“要是命令的话，我就过去，可是国王陛下明鉴，按比赛规则，只要还有人想来挑战我，我就只能留在原地不动。”","“If it is a command, I will come, but my lord the king knows that I am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire to come against me.”"
"我等了等。没人上前挑战。于是我说道：","I waited.Nobody challenged.Then I said:"
"“我已经赢得了这场比赛，而且赢得光明正大，谁要是对此质疑，我不等他们来向我挑战，我自会挑战他们。”","“If there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won, I do not wait for them to challenge me, I challenge them.”"
"“这等叫阵果真英勇，”国王说到，“而且很符合你的身份。那你会先点谁的名来开战呢？”","“It is a gallant offer,” said the king, “and well beseems you.Whom will you name first?”"
"“我谁的名也不点，我向所有人挑战！我就站在这儿，敢问英国的骑士们哪个敢过来跟我对战——不用一个一个来，而是一起上！”","“I name none, I challenge all!Here I stand, and dare the chivalry of England to come against me—not by individuals, but in mass!”"
"“什么！”十几个骑士一起喊道。","“What!” shouted a score of knights."
"“你们都听见叫阵了吧。要么接受，要么我就宣布你们这些骑士都是胆小鬼，是我手下败将，谁也不例外！”","“You have heard the challenge.Take it, or I proclaim you recreant knights and vanquished, every one!”"
"你明白，我这都是“唬人”。在这种时候，只要你厚起脸皮，硬要把一说成一百，这做法准奏效。五十次有四十九次没人敢“叫牌”，你就等着划拉筹码吧。可是只有这一次——咳，事情有点不对劲！霎那间，五百骑士纷纷翻身上马，你还没来得及眨下眼，那一大片散开的人就出动了，马蹄嗒嗒朝我奔了过来。我把枪套里的两支手枪都拿了出来，开始目测距离，计算准头。","It was a “bluff” you know.At such a time it is sound judgment to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what it is worth; forty-nine times out of fifty nobody dares to “call,” and you rake in the chips.But just this once—well, things looked squally!In just no time, five hundred knights were scrambling into their saddles, and before you could wink a widely scattering drove were under way and clattering down upon me. 　I snatched both revolvers from the holsters and began to measure distances and calculate chances."
"砰！一个马鞍上人没了。砰！又是一个。砰——砰，我杀了两个。嗯，我们可谓是势均力敌，我很清楚这点。要是我打了十一枪还没有镇住他们，第十二个人必定会杀了我。所以当我第九次将他们的人放倒时，发现人群开始动摇起来，眼看就要慌乱了，此时我真是前所未有的开心。如今我只要耽误一刻，最后的机会可就没了。不过我可没有耽误。我两把枪都举了起来，瞄准了他们——那队忽然停住了的人马只不过挺了一分钟，就四散奔逃了。","Bang!One saddle empty.Bang! 　Another one.Bang—bang, and I bagged two.Well, it was nip and tuck with us, and I knew it.If I spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people, the twelfth man would kill me, sure.And so I never did feel so happy as I did when my ninth downed its man and I detected the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic.An instant lost now could knock out my last chance.But I didn’t lose it.I raised both revolvers and pointed them—the halted host stood their ground just about one good square moment, then broke and fled."
"胜利是属于我的了。骑士制度已经是在劫难逃了。文明进行曲已经奏响了。我心中感觉怎样呢？啊，你压根儿就想像不到。","The day was mine.Knight-errantry was a doomed institution.The march of civilization was begun.How did I feel?Ah, you never could imagine it."
"那默林老哥呢？他再一次垮台了。　不管怎么，只要耍鬼把戏的魔法想和科学的魔法一较高下，没有一次不是耍鬼把戏的魔法败下阵来的。","And Brer Merlin?His stock was flat again.Somehow, every time the magic of fol-de-rol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of fol-de-rol got left."
"第四十章　三年以后","CHAPTER 40 Three Years Later"
"自从那时骑士制度被我打倒以来，我就觉得再没那个必要偷偷摸摸干了。因此，第二天我就把我那些隐蔽起来的学校、矿场，还有我那体系庞大的秘密工厂和作坊，都公之于众，让全世界都大吃一惊。也就是说，我把十九世纪摆到了公元六世纪的审视之下。","WHEN I broke the back of knight-errantry that time, I no longer felt obliged to work in secret.So, the very next day I exposed my hidden schools, my mines, and my vast system of clandestine factories and workshops to an astonished world.That is to say, I exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth."
"嗯，乘胜追击这个方法准没错。骑士们暂时算是倒下了，可是要他们永远这样，我只能把他们都弄瘫痪——差一点儿也不成。你瞧，上次在比武场上我是在“虚张声势”，要是我给他们机会，他们自然能想明白这点。因此我不能给他们时机，我也没给他们。","Well, it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly.The knights were temporarily down, but if I would keep them so I must just simply paralyze them—nothing short of that would answer.You see, I was “bluffing” that last time in the field; it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion, if I gave them a chance.So I must not give them time; and I didn’t."
"我重新提出了挑战，把它刻在了铜牌上，张贴在那些有牧师能读给他们听的地方，而且还刊登在了报纸的广告栏中。","I renewed my challenge, engraved it on brass, posted it up where any priest could read it to them, and also kept it standing in the advertising columns of the paper."
"我不仅重新提出了挑战，还增加了它的分量。我在战书中说，定个日子，我只带五十名帮手，就算是全世界的骑士都一拥而上，我也能抵抗得了，将其歼灭。","I not only renewed it, but added to its proportions.I said, name the day, and I would take fifty assistants and stand up AGAINST THE MASSED CHIVALRY OF THE WHOLE EARTH AND DESTROY IT."
"这次我可不是虚张声势。我可不是开玩笑，我说到做到。挑战书上的话说得明明白白，没有会引起人误解的地方。即使是最愚笨的骑士也能感觉到，这次直截了当，就是“要么抵抗，要么闭嘴”。他们可不傻，选择了后者。在接下来的三年中他们没给我惹什么大麻烦。","I was not bluffing this time.I meant what I said; I could do what I promised.There wasn’t any way to misunderstand the language of that challenge.Even the dullest of the chivalry perceived that this was a plain case of “put up, or shut up.” 　They were wise and did the latter.In all the next three years they gave me no trouble worth mentioning."
"想想这三年过得真快啊。现在看看英国是什么样的吧。一片欢乐而繁荣，这个国家变得让人都认不出来了。学校遍地都是，还有几所大学，相当不错的报纸也有几家。就连写书这码子事都开始起步了；幽默家丁纳丹爵士第一个涉足了这个行业，写了一卷白发苍苍的笑话，那些笑话在一千三百年以来我都听烂了。要是他没把关于演说家的那个腐臭的老笑话写进去，我也就不说什么了，可我就是容忍不了那个笑话。我把这本书封了，把作者绞死了。","Consider the three years sped.Now look around on England.A happy and prosperous country, and strangely altered.Schools everywhere, and several colleges; a number of pretty good newspapers.Even authorship was taking a start; Sir Dinadan the Humorist was first in the field, with a volume of gray-headed jokes which I had been familiar with during thirteen centuries.If he had left out that old rancid one about the lecturer I wouldn’t have said anything; but I couldn’t stand that one.I suppressed the book and hanged the author."
"奴隶制已经灭亡了，烟消云散了；法律面前人人平等了；税收也均等了。电报、电话、留声机、打字机和缝纫机，以及上千种利用蒸汽和电力的能为我们所用的东西，既听使唤，用起来也很方便，渐渐地流行开了。我们在泰晤士河上有一两艘轮船，还有几艘蒸汽战舰，商业舰队也初具规模；我正准备派出一支探险队去发现美洲。","Slavery was dead and gone; all men were equal before the law; taxation had been equalized.The telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the typewriter, the sewing-machine, and all the thousand willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their way into favor.We had a steamboat or two on the Thames, we had steam warships, and the beginnings of a steam commercial marine; I was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover America."
"我们正在建造几条铁路，从卡米洛到伦敦的那条已经竣工投入使用了。我很明智，提高所有与旅客服务相关部门人员的地位，提到很高很显要的位置。我的想法是借此吸引骑士和贵族，把他们变成有用之才，让他们别捣乱。这个计划进展顺利，这些岗位的竞争非常火热。四点三十三分快车的列车员是位公爵，这条铁路线上的列车管理员没有一位的爵位在伯爵以下。他们个个都不错，可是有两个缺点我却无法纠正，因此只能睁一只眼闭一只眼：一个是他们不肯脱去身上的铠甲，一个是他们还要把车费“杀杀价”——我是说抢劫公司。","We were building several lines of railway, and our line from Camelot to London was already finished and in operation.I was shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger service places of high and distinguished honor.My idea was to attract the chivalry and nobility, and make them useful and keep them out of mischief.The plan worked very well, the competition for the places was hot.  The conductor of the 4.33 express was a duke; there wasn’t a passenger conductor on the line below the degree of earl.They were good men, every one, but they had two defects which I couldn’t cure, and so had to wink at: they wouldn’t lay aside their armor, and they would “knock down” fare—I mean rob the company."
"全国上下，几乎所有的骑士都在从事一项有用的职业。他们在全国各地东游西荡，用不同的方式行使着有利于民的传道者身份；他们对于游荡生活的热爱，以及他们在这方面的经验，使他们成为我们所拥有的最有效的文明传播者。他们总是穿着钢甲，配上刀剑、长矛和战斧到处游走，向人家推销可以分期付款的缝纫机啦，风琴啦，带铁刺的铁丝网啦，或是宣传禁酒的杂志啦，或是上千种诸如此类的玩意儿中任意一种，若是推销不成，他们就把人家除掉，然后继续上路。　","There was hardly a knight in all the land who wasn’t in some useful employment.They were going from end to end of the country in all manner of useful missionary capacities; their penchant for wandering, and their experience in it, made them altogether the most effective spreaders of civilization we had. 　They went clothed in steel and equipped with sword and lance and battle-axe, and if they couldn’t persuade a person to try a sewing-machine on the installment plan, or a melodeon, or a barbed-wire fence, or a prohibition journal, or any of the other thousand and one things they canvassed for, they removed him and passed on."
"我非常开心。事情正稳定地朝着我暗地里盼望的方向发展。你瞧，在我头脑中有两套计划，在我所有计划当中就数这两个最宏大了。一个是推翻天主教会，在它的废墟上建立国教——不是那种已经确立的国教，而是任由你加入退出的教会；另一个计划是很快让国王颁布一道政令，命令在亚瑟王驾崩之后全国采取普选制度，不论男女——不管怎样至少是全体成年男子，无论聪明愚钝，还有那些中年妇女，只要能和自己二十一岁的儿子懂得的东西不差上下的，都可以。亚瑟王还有三十年的好日子，他和我的岁数差不多——也就是说，四十岁——我相信在这段时间里我能轻而易举地使这个国家人口中积极的那部分人愿意并急于投身到世界史上破天荒的一个事件当中——一场全面彻底而且不用流血的政体改革。目的就是要建立一个共和国。　嗯，我还是招了吧，尽管一想起来就觉得害臊：我开始有了一种卑鄙的想法，就是想自己当第一任总统。是呀，我身上也多多少少有点人性，我发现了这点。","I was very happy.Things were working steadily toward a secretly longed-for point.You see, I had two schemes in my head which were the vastest of all my projects.The one was to overthrow the Catholic Church and set up the Protestant faith on its ruins—not as an Established Church, but a go-as-you-please one; and the other project was to get a decree issued by and by, commanding that upon Arthur’s death unlimited suffrage should be introduced, and given to men and women alike—at any rate to all men, wise or unwise, and to all mothers who at middle age should be found to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty-one.Arthur was good for thirty years yet, he being about my own age—that is to say, forty—and I believed that in that time I could easily have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history of the world—a rounded and complete governmental revolution without bloodshed.The result to be a republic.Well, I may as well confess, though I do feel ashamed when I think of it: I was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president myself.Yes, there was more or less human nature in me; I found that out."
"克拉伦斯在革命方面和我意见基本一致，不过略为温和。他的想法是建立一个共和国，没有特权阶级，不过还由世袭的王室担任国家元首，而不是由选举出来的首席官员担当。他认为凡是体验过王室崇拜乐趣的国家，一旦被剥夺了这种快乐，无一例外都会变得萎靡不振，忧郁而死。我强调说国王们可是很危险的。他说，那就用猫好了。他敢肯定猫族王室一定会有求必应。他们会像其他王室一样有用，懂的都差不多，拥有相同的美德，同样阴险狡诈，他们拥有同样的品性，喜欢跟其他王室猫咪们吵吵闹闹，他们虚荣荒唐得可笑而自己却浑然不知，他们完全没什么价值；最后，他们还会和其他王室一样拥有天授神权，而那些普通的公猫，穿上紧身衣，当了国王，头上冠以“上帝保佑的汤姆七世，或是汤姆十一世，或汤姆十六世”的头衔，听起来一样的像模像样。","Clarence was with me as concerned the revolution, but in a modified way. 　His idea was a republic, without privileged orders, but with a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective chief magistrate.He believed that no nation that had ever known the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it and not fade away and die of melancholy.I urged that kings were dangerous.He said, then have cats.He was sure that a royal family of cats would answer every purpose.They would be as useful as any other royal family, they would know as much, they would have the same virtues and the same treacheries, the same disposition to get up shindies with other royal cats, they would be laughably vain and absurd and never know it, they would be wholly inexpensive; finally, they would have as sound a divine right as any other royal house, and “Tom VII., or Tom XI., or Tom XIV. by the grace of God King,” would sound as well as it would when applied to the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on . "
"“通常说来，”他用利落的现代英语说道，“这些猫们的性格会比普通国王的性格好很多，这对一个国家来讲是巨大的道德优势，因为一个国家总是会模仿它的君主的道德。既然对王室的崇拜都是基于非理性的，那么这些优雅而又无害的猫们就可以轻而易举地和其他王室一样神圣，说真的，也许还能更神圣点，因为你很快就会发现，它们不会把谁绞死，或砍谁的头，或者把谁关到监狱里去，或是做下任何残忍狠毒、不仁不义的事情，因此它们比按传统由人担当的君主更值得人去热爱和尊敬，而且一定会赢得这种热爱和尊敬。饱受折磨的世界人民很快就会把目光都聚集在这种仁慈高尚的体制上，而像屠夫一样的王室很快就会逐渐消失；他们的属民就会用小猫们来填补我们自己王室家族的空缺；我们会变成工厂，供应全世界的国王，不出四十年整个欧洲就会由猫来统治，而我们负责猫的供给。到那时，世界和平的时代就开始了， 再也不会结束，直到永远…喵喵呜呜呜呜——噗嗤！——呜嗷！”","“And as a rule,” said he, in his neat modern English, “the character of these cats would be considerably above the character of the average king, and this would be an immense moral advantage to the nation, for the reason that a nation always models its morals after its monarch’s.The worship of royalty being founded in unreason, these graceful and harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties, and indeed more so, because it would presently be noticed that they hanged nobody, beheaded nobody, imprisoned nobody, inflicted no cruelties or injustices of any sort, and so must be worthy of a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king, and would certainly get it.The eyes of the whole harried world would soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system, and royal butchers would presently begin to disappear; their subjects would fill the vacancies with catlings from our own royal house; we should become a factory; we should supply the thrones of the world; within forty years all Europe would be governed by cats, and we should furnish the cats.The reign of universal peace would begin then, to end no more forever......Me-e-e-yow-ow-ow-ow—fzt!—wow!”"
"该死的家伙，我本来还以为他是认真的呢，差点就被他说服了，直到他发出这声猫叫，吓得我差点从自己的衣服里蹦出来。可他就没有认真的时候。他自己都不知道自己在说什么。　他明明已经描绘出一幅清晰的君主立宪改良版的画面，完全合情合理，切实可行，可是他太愚蠢了，对此浑然不知，而且也毫不关心。　我正打算骂他一顿，可正在这时桑迪飞奔了过来，吓得魂不附体，哭得抽抽嗒嗒，一时间话都说不出来了。我跑过去把她搂在怀里，一个劲地抚摸着她，恳求她道：","Hang him, I supposed he was in earnest, and was beginning to be persuaded by him, until he exploded that cat-howl and startled me almost out of my clothes.But he never could be in earnest.He didn’t know what it was.He had pictured a distinct and perfectly rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy, but he was too feather-headed to know it, or care anything about it, either.I was going to give him a scolding, but Sandy came flying in at that moment, wild with terror, and so choked with sobs that for a minute she could not get her voice.I ran and took her in my arms, and lavished caresses upon her and said, beseechingly:"
"“说话，亲爱的，说话呀！怎么回事？”","“Speak, darling, speak!What is it?”"
"她把脑袋耷拉在我怀里，大口喘着气，用几乎让人听不到的声音说：","Her head fell limp upon my bosom, and she gasped, almost inaudibly:"
"“总机！”(注：这是桑迪和头子的孩子的名字)","“HELLO-CENTRAL!”"
"“快！”我朝克拉伦斯喊到，“快打电话把国王的同种疗法医师请来！”","“Quick!” I shouted to Clarence; “telephone the king’s homeopath to come!”"
"两分钟不到我已经跪在了孩子的摇篮旁，而桑迪打发仆人这儿那儿地满皇宫乱跑。我几乎是一眼就看出了怎么回事——喉膜炎！我弯下身去，悄声说：","In two minutes I was kneeling by the child’s crib, and Sandy was dispatching servants here, there, and everywhere, all over the palace.I took in the situation almost at a glance—membranous croup!I bent down and whispered:"
"“醒醒，宝贝！总机！”","“Wake up, sweetheart!Hello-Central”"
"她无精打采地睁开那温柔的眼睛，勉强说了声：","She opened her soft eyes languidly, and made out to say:"
"“爸爸。”","“Papa.”"
"这真是个安慰。她离死还远着呢。　我派人去准备硫磺，又亲自去把喉炎药锅找了出来。每当桑迪或是孩子生病的时候，我决不会干坐着等医生。我知道如何看护她俩，我有这方面的经验。　小家伙从生下来到现在这短短的几年时间大部分都是在我怀中度过，经常我只要哄哄她就什么事都没有了，她母亲还在那儿哭，她却透过挂着泪珠的睫毛笑了。　","That was a comfort.She was far from dead yet.I sent for preparations of sulphur, I rousted out the croup-kettle myself; for I don’t sit down and wait for doctors when Sandy or the child is sick.I knew how to nurse both of them, and had had experience.This little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life, and often I could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh through the tear-dews on its eyelashes when even its mother couldn’t."
"兰斯洛特爵士身着他最华丽的铠甲，正沿着大厅朝证券委员会大步走来；他是证券委员会主席，占据着他从加拉哈德爵士手里买来的那个“催命椅”。由于证券委员会是由圆桌骑士们组成的，因此他们现在用圆桌来进行交易。圆桌的座位值多少钱——咳，反正你也不会相信这个数字的，说了也没用。　　兰斯洛特爵士是卖空的人，已经把新股票中的一支一路杀跌，今天正打算去“杀空头”呢，可是那又怎么样？　他还是原先那个兰斯洛特，打门口过时他往里瞥了一眼，发现他的小宝贝病了，这对他就足够了。什么多头空头，让它们自己杀个明白去吧，他才不管呢，他要马上到这儿来，竭尽所能照顾小“总机”。他就是这样做的。他把头盔往角落里一扔，半分钟不到他就给酒精灯换了根新灯芯，开始给喉炎药锅点火。此时桑迪已经在摇篮上用毯子搭了个篷帐，一切就绪。","Sir Launcelot, in his richest armor, came striding along the great hall now on his way to the stockboard; he was president of the stock-board, and occupied the Siege Perilous, which he had bought of Sir Galahad; for the stock-board consisted of the Knights of the Round Table, and they used the Round Table for business purposes now.Seats at it were worth—well, you would never believe the figure, so it is no use to state it.Sir Launcelot was a bear, and he had put up a corner in one of the new lines, and was just getting ready to squeeze the shorts to-day; but what of that?He was the same old Launcelot, and when he glanced in as he was passing the door and found out that his pet was sick, that was enough for him; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all him, he would come right in here and stand by little Hello-Central for all he was worth.And that was what he did. 　He shied his helmet into the corner, and in half a minute he had a new wick in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup-kettle.By this time Sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib, and everything was ready."
"兰斯洛特爵士越干越起劲，他和我在锅里装上生石灰和碳酸，在此基础上又加了点乳酸，接着把锅里装满水，把出气的壶嘴插在篷帐底下。现在一切都井然有序，我俩分坐在摇篮两边，负责守护。桑迪很是感激，而且也大受安慰，所以就给两杆长陶土烟斗装上柳树皮和黄烟叶，递给我们俩，告诉我们想抽多少就抽多少，反正也进不到篷帐底下去，她也已经习惯烟味了，因为她可是本国内第一个见识过吞云吐雾的女士呢。嗯，看到兰斯洛特爵士穿着他华贵的铠甲，叼着一码来长雪白的长烟斗，神态舒适而平和，看起来真是赏心悦目，让人舒坦极了。他是个美男子，人很可爱，满心打算的都是如何让老婆孩子高兴。　不过，当然了，桂乃芬——可是，木已成舟，后悔也没用了。","Sir Launcelot got up steam, he and I loaded up the kettle with unslaked lime and carbolic acid, with a touch of lactic acid added thereto, then filled the thing up with water and inserted the steam-spout under the canopy.Everything was ship-shape now, and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch.Sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple of church-wardens with willow-bark and sumach-tobacco for us, and told us to smoke as much as we pleased, it couldn’t get under the canopy, and she was used to smoke, being the first lady in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown.Well, there couldn’t be a more contented or comfortable sight than Sir Launcelot in his noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard of snowy church-warden.He was a beautiful man, a lovely man, and was just intended to make a wife and children happy.But, of course Guenever—however, it’s no use to cry over what’s done and can’t be helped."
"嗯，他和我轮班守护着，一直看守了三天三夜，直到孩子脱离了危险才罢；那时他把孩子抱在自己宽广的怀抱里，亲了亲她，盔缨垂到了她的金发上，然后他把孩子轻轻放回桑迪的怀里，庄重而威严地走向宽阔的大厅，在列队两边的军士和奴仆钦佩的目光中走过，然后就不见了。我的直觉没有任何预警，在这个世界里我再也看不到他了！老天，多么让人心碎的世界呀。","Well, he stood watch-and-watch with me, right straight through, for three days and nights, till the child was out of danger; then he took her up in his great arms and kissed her, with his plumes falling about her golden head, then laid her softly in Sandy’s lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall, between the ranks of admiring men-at-arms and menials, and so disappeared.And no instinct warned me that I should never look upon him again in this world!Lord, what a world of heart-break it is."
"大夫们说我们要想把孩子调养得身强体壮，就必须带她离开这里。而且她必须得呼吸点海上的空气。于是我们登上了一艘军舰，带了二百六十名随从，出海远航，两个礼拜后我们在法国海岸登陆了，大夫们认为在那里小住几天是个不错的主意。当地的小国之君要尽地主之谊，我们欣然接受了。要是他提供的便利和他不能提供的一样多，我们也能觉得够舒服了；即使是这样，我们在他那古怪的老城堡里还是凭借着从船上拿来的舒适品和奢侈品，凑合凑合也过得不错。","The doctors said we must take the child away, if we would coax her back to health and strength again.And she must have sea-air.So we took a man-of-war, and a suite of two hundred and sixty persons, and went cruising about, and after a fortnight of this we stepped ashore on the French coast, and the doctors thought it would be a good idea to make something of a stay there.The little king of that region offered us his hospitalities, and we were glad to accept.If he had had as many conveniences as he lacked, we should have been plenty comfortable enough; even as it was, we made out very well, in his queer old castle, by the help of comforts and luxuries from the ship."
"过了一个月，我打发那搜船回国，装些新鲜的供给，顺便带点新闻回来。我们预期它三四天就能回来。除了其他新闻，它还该带回来我刚开始的一项实验结果。这是我的一个计划，要找个什么东西来代替比武大会，从而能够给那些骑士们过剩的精力提供个发泄口，即让那些小伙子们娱乐娱乐，不胡闹惹事，同时也能保存他们身上最大的优点，那就是他们百折不挠的竞争精神。我从他们当中精心挑选了一批，秘密训练了一段日子了，现在他们首次公开表演的日期眼看就要到了。","At the end of a month I sent the vessel home for fresh supplies, and for news.We expected her back in three or four days.She would bring me, along with other news, the result of a certain experiment which I had been starting.It was a project of mine to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an escape for the extra steam of the chivalry, keep those bucks entertained and out of mischief, and at the same time preserve the best thing in them, which was their hardy spirit of emulation.I had had a choice band of them in private training for some time, and the date was now arriving for their first public effort."
"这项实验就是打棒球。为了让这玩意儿从一开始就受人欢迎，避免受到批评，我是凭爵位而不是凭能力来挑选我的队员。两队中没有哪个骑士不是大权在握的君主。至于这类材料，亚瑟王周围向来都是资源过剩。你随便朝哪个方向扔块砖头，都会砸瘸一个君主。当然了，让这些家伙脱去铠甲我可办不到，即使是洗澡的时候他们都不肯脱下。他们同意在铠甲上两支队伍有所不同，免得分不出哪队是哪队，不过顶多也就是这样了。于是，一队穿上锁子甲长战袍，一队则穿着我新研发的“贝西默”钢制成的板甲。他们在场地练习的时候，奇妙无比，真是前所未见。因为有铠甲护身，他们从来不跳开去躲球，而是一动不动站在那里，随球怎么打都行。当一名穿贝西默钢甲的球员进攻时被球打中了，球有时能弹出一百五十码远。而要是谁正在跑垒，身子趴在地上，闷着头往前跑，看起来真像是一艘铁甲船进港了。一开始我任命没有爵位的人来担任裁判员，可是后来这么做继续不下去了。这些人还不如其他队员好伺候呢。这种裁判员的第一个裁定通常也就是他的最后一个；他们会用球棒把他揍成两截，他的朋友会把他用窗板抬回家去。等到人人都注意到没有裁判员能活着挺过一场球赛，裁判员可就没人爱当了。因此我不得不任命个能有高官显位当挡箭牌的家伙了。","This experiment was baseball.In order to give the thing vogue from the start, and place it out of the reach of criticism, I chose my nines by rank, not capacity.There wasn’t a knight in either team who wasn’t a sceptered sovereign.As for material of this sort, there was a glut of it always around Arthur.You couldn’t throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king.Of course, I couldn’t get these people to leave off their armor; they wouldn’t do that when they bathed.They consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other, but that was the most they would do.So, one of the teams wore chain-mail ulsters, and the other wore platearmor made of my new Bessemer steel.Their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing I ever saw.Being ball-proof, they never skipped out of the way, but stood still and took the result; when a Bessemer was at the bat and a ball hit him, it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes.And when a man was running, and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base, it was like an iron-clad coming into port.At first I appointed men of no rank to act as umpires, but I had to discontinue that.These people were no easier to please than other nines.The umpire’s first decision was usually his last; they broke him in two with a bat, and his friends toted him home on a shutter.When it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game, umpiring got to be unpopular.So I was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him."
"以下就是两队队员名单：","Here are the names of the nines:"
"贝西默　阿尔斯特","BESSEMERS ULSTERS"
"亚瑟王卢修斯帝王","KING ARTHUR.EMPEROR LUCIUS."
"洛西恩的洛特王洛格里斯王","KING LOT OF LOTHIAN.KING LOGRIS."

"第一次公开赛必定能引来五万名观众，为了这切切实实的乐趣，就算是环游地球来看也是值得的。事事都能助上一臂之力，此时正是春天，风和日丽，大自然也从头到脚都换上了新装。","The first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people; and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see.　Everything would be favorable; it was balmy and beautiful spring weather now, and Nature was all tailored out in her new clothes."
"第四十一章　禁行圣事令","CHAPTER 41 The Interdict"
"可是，我的注意力突然被从这件事上挪走了；我们的孩子病情再度恶化，我们只得不分白昼看护她，她的病情很严重。　这件事让谁来代劳我们也于心不忍，于是就我俩轮流交替，没日没夜地守护着。啊呀，桑迪这个人心肠多好啊，多么单纯，多么真诚，真是个可人儿！作为妻子，作为母亲，她都是无可指摘的；不过我娶了她却不为别的，只因为按照骑士传统，如果没有哪位骑士在比武场上将我打败，她就一直是属于我的财产。为了找到我她寻遍了全英国，然后在伦敦城外要被绞死的奴隶里头发现了我，而且马上就重归原位，陪在我身边，而且态度还无比宁静坦然，就好像是她的权利似的。我是新英格兰人，在我看来，她老这么陪着我，总有一天会损害到她的名誉。她还不大明白是怎么回事，不过我来了个长话短说，直接跟她举行了婚礼。","HOWEVER, my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters; our child began to lose ground again, and we had to go to sitting up with her, her case became so serious.We couldn’t bear to allow anybody to help in this service, so we two stood watch-and-watch, day in and day out.　Ah, Sandy, what a right heart she had, how simple, and genuine, and good she was!She was a flawless wife and mother; and yet I had married her for no other particular reasons, except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property until some knight should win her from me in the field.She had hunted Britain over for me; had found me at the hanging-bout outside of London, and had straightway resumed her old place at my side in the placidest way and as of right.I was a New Englander, and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her, sooner or later.She couldn’t see how, but I cut argument short and we had a wedding."
"当时我还不知道自己中了头彩，不过我确实是中了。一年不到，我就成了她的崇拜者；我们之间的情谊亲密无间，和和美美，古来少有。人们总是谈论同性间的美好友谊。可是跟夫妻间的友谊相比，跟夫妻间这种最美好的冲动与最高的理想合二为一的情谊相比，又算得了什么？这两种情谊之间根本没有可比性；一种是人间的，一种是天上的。","Now I didn’t know I was drawing a prize, yet that was what I did draw.Within the twelvemonth I became her worshiper; and ours was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was.People talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same sex. 　What is the best of that sort, as compared with the friendship of man and wife, where the best impulses and highest ideals of both are the same?There is no place for comparison between the two friendships; the one is earthly, the other divine."
"刚一开始，我在梦中仍然会游荡在一千三百年之后，我那永不满足的灵魂四处呼喊着，倾听着，在一个已经消失了的世界里游来荡去，却没有回应。桑迪有好几次在我睡觉的时候从我嘴里听到了这种哀求的哭喊。出于非同一般的宽宏之心，她将那哭喊归于我们的孩子头上，以为那是我一个丢失了的宝贝的名字。这下把我感动得直掉泪，而当她冲着我的脸笑，想得到她应得的回报，冷不防说出她那古怪有趣的想法时，差点没把我吓得跳起来：","In my dreams, along at first, I still wandered thirteen centuries away, and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world.Many a time Sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep.With a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our child, conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine.It touched me to tears, and it also nearly knocked me off my feet, too, when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward, and played her quaint and pretty surprise upon me:"
"“你那宝贝的名字已经被我保存下来了，变得很神圣，它那音乐会永远回荡在你我耳边。你现在知道了我要给孩子起什么名字，还不亲亲我。”","“The name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved, here made holy, and the music of it will abide alway in our ears.Now thou’lt kiss me, as knowing the name I have given the child.”"
"可是尽管如此，我依然还不明白。　我根本摸不着头脑，可是要坦白说出来，又怕扫了她的兴，那也太残忍了。于是我就没表露出来，而是说：","But I didn’t know it, all the same.I hadn’t an idea in the world; but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game; so I never let on, but said:"
"“不错，我知道了，亲爱的——你真是太好了！可是我还是希望能听到先从你嘴里说出来，你的也就是我的——那样的话这音乐也就完美了。”","“Yes, I know, sweetheart—how dear and good it is of you, too!But I want to hear these lips of yours, which are also mine, utter it first—then its music will be perfect.”"
"她乐到了心窝里了，柔声说道：","Pleased to the marrow, she murmured:"
"“总机！”","“HELLO-CENTRAL!”"
"我没有笑——我至今仍对此感到庆幸——可这一憋却把我搞得身上每一寸软骨都断开了，过了好几个礼拜我走路时还能听见骨头啪嗒作响的声音。她一直没有发现自己犯了什么错误。她头一次听到打电话的这么说，还有点吃惊，不大高兴；不过我告诉她是我下令这么说的：从今往后，无论何时，打电话一开头都得用那种虔诚礼拜的仪式，用以永久地尊敬和纪念我那找不到了的朋友和与她名字一样的小宝贝儿。这不是真的。不过很管用。","I didn’t laugh—I am always thankful for that—but the strain ruptured every cartilage in me, and for weeks afterward I could hear my bones clack when I walked.She never found out her mistake.The first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised, and not pleased; but I told her I had given order for it: that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality, in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake.This was not true.But it answered."
"嗯，有两个半礼拜我们一直守护在摇篮旁，深为焦虑，根本没意识到病房之外发生了些什么。不久我们就得到了回报：宇宙的中心终于转危为安，开始康复起来。感激涕零？　这话不太对。世上就没有什么话能表达出来这种感受的。要是你也曾经眼睁睁看着自己的孩子穿过那死亡之谷，又看着它活了过来，那用一只手就可以盖住的小脸上露出一抹笑容，能扫尽世间的黑夜，照亮一切，你肯定就能明白这感受。","Well, during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib, and in our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of that sick-room.Then our reward came: the center of the universe turned the corner and began to mend.Grateful?　It isn’t the term.There ISN’T any term for it.You know that yourself, if you’ve watched your child through the Valley of the Shadow and seen it come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one all-illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand."
"噢，霎那间我们又回到了这个世界！接着我们四目相对，从对方脸上同时读出了吓人一跳的想法；两个多周过去了，那艘船却还没回来！","Why, we were back in this world in one instant!Then we looked the same startled thought into each other’s eyes at the same moment; more than two weeks gone, and that ship not back yet!"
"不到一分钟我就出现在了我那帮随从面前。这些天来他们一直忧心忡忡，疑神疑鬼——从他们脸上就能看得出来。我喊来一名护卫，我俩飞奔了五里路，跑到一个山顶俯瞰大海。前不久，我那巨大的商船队还像白色翅膀一样将波光粼粼的广阔大海装点得熙熙攘攘，美丽无比，如今它们到哪里去了？都消失了，一艘也不见了！四下里一片帆也没有，一柱黑烟也见不到——只剩下一片死气沉沉、空空荡荡的寂静，代替了往日忙忙碌碌、生机盎然的景象。","In another minute I appeared in the presence of my train.They had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time—their faces showed it.　I called an escort and we galloped five miles to a hilltop overlooking the sea. 　Where was my great commerce that so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful with its white-winged flocks?Vanished, every one!Not a sail, from verge to verge, not a smoke-bank—just a dead and empty solitude, in place of all that brisk and breezy life."
"我飞快地赶了回来，对谁也没说一个字。我只把这可怕的消息告诉了桑迪。我们怎么也想不出个原因来解释这件事。有外敌入侵？发生了地震？还是瘟疫？整个国家都已经不复存在了吗？可是怎么猜也没有用。我必须去一趟——马上。我借来了国王的海军——一艘跟汽艇一样大的“战舰”——很快就准备完毕。","I went swiftly back, saying not a word to anybody.I told Sandy this ghastly news.We could imagine no explanation that would begin to explain.Had there been an invasion?An earthquake?A pestilence?Had the nation been swept out of existence?But guessing was profitless.I must go—at once.I borrowed the king’s navy—a “ship” no bigger than a steam launch—and was soon ready."
"离别——啊，不错，这可是难分难舍。我正不停地吻着孩子，怎么吻也吻不够似的，它突然变得活跃起来，把会说的话都咿咿呀呀说了出来！——两个多礼拜了，这还是头一回，这下我俩都乐傻了。孩童时代这种错误的发音是多么可爱呀！——啊呀天呐，没有什么音乐比这更动听了；等它随着时间一天天过去，发音变得正确了，你就会伤心不已，明白自己再也享不到这种耳福了。嗨，能把这份珍贵的记忆随着带走，对我来说是多么美妙啊！","The parting—ah, yes, that was hard.As I was devouring the child with last kisses, it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary!—the first time in more than two weeks, and it made fools of us for joy.　The darling mispronunciations of childhood!—dear me, there’s no music that can touch it; and how one grieves when it wastes away and dissolves into correctness, knowing it will never visit his bereaved ear again.Well, how good it was to be able to carry that gracious memory away with me!"
"第二天一早我就离英国不远了，那一大片宽阔的盐水大路上只有我一个人。在多佛也有船停在港口，不过它们都光秃秃的没有张帆，甚至连个人影都没有。那天是礼拜天；可是就连坎特伯雷的街上都空空荡荡的；最让人奇怪的是，一个教士也看不到，也没有一声钟声落入我的耳朵。到处都是死气沉沉。我真是搞不明白了。最后我在城那头看到一小队出殡的——跟在棺材后头的只有死者的家属和几个朋友——没有一位牧师；这场葬礼没有什么仪式；附近就有一座教堂，可是他们却一路哭哭啼啼地走了过去，门都没进；我抬头看了一眼钟塔，钟挂在那儿，罩着黑布，钟舌绑了起来。这下我明白了！这下我终于明白，一场巨大的灾难降临到了英国头上。外敌入侵？　比起它来，外敌入侵不过是小菜一碟。这是禁行圣事！","I approached England the next morning, with the wide highway of salt water all to myself.There were ships in the harbor, at Dover, but they were naked as to sails, and there was no sign of life about them.It was Sunday; yet at Canterbury the streets were empty; strangest of all, there was not even a priest in sight, and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear. 　The mournfulness of death was everywhere.I couldn’t understand it.At last, in the further edge of that town I saw a small funeral procession—just a family and a few friends following a coffin—no priest; a funeral without bell, book, or candle; there was a church there close at hand, but they passed it by weeping, and did not enter it; I glanced up at the belfry, and there hung the bell, shrouded in black, and its tongue tied back.Now I knew!Now I understood the stupendous calamity that had overtaken England.Invasion? 　Invasion is a triviality to it.It was the INTERDICT!"
"我什么也没问；我也不需要问了。教会已经下手了，我能做的就是改头换面，小心翼翼地离开。手下的一个仆人给了我一套衣服，等我们安全出城后我就把它们换上，从那时起我就独自旅行了，我不能冒那个险，和别人搭伴儿太让我为难了。","I asked no questions; I didn’t need to ask any. 　The Church had struck; the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise, and go warily.One of my servants gave me a suit of clothes, and when we were safe beyond the town I put them on, and from that time I traveled alone; I could not risk the embarrassment of company."
"这一路可真够悲惨的。到处都是一片凄冷，一片寂静。即便是伦敦也是如此。交通早已停止了，人们不苟言笑，也没有三五成群的，甚至两人结伴的都没有。他们漫无目的地走着，形单影只，耷拉个脑袋，心里只有悲伤和恐惧。从伦敦塔上可以看到战争的痕迹。千真万确，最近必定发生了好多事情。","A miserable journey.A desolate silence everywhere.Even in London itself.Traffic had ceased; men did not talk or laugh, or go in groups, or even in couples; they moved aimlessly about, each man by himself, with his head down, and woe and terror at his heart.The Tower showed recent war-scars.Verily, much had been happening."
"当然，我本来打算乘火车赶往卡米洛。火车！唉，火车站早就像山洞一样空空如也。我继续往前走。去卡米洛这一路上，只不过是把我刚才所见所闻又经历了一遍。周一和周二这两天和周日没什么两样。　我于深夜到达了卡米洛。它本来是本国电力照明最好的城市，你肯定从未见过比它更像一轮侧卧的太阳的城市了，而如今它仅仅成了一个点——黑暗之中的一个点——也就是说，它比周围的黑暗还要漆黑，还要厚实，因此你能更清楚地看到它；这让我感觉它是有象征意义的——象征着教会此刻就要占上风，把我那美丽的文明都像这样给扼杀掉。我在那些阴沉沉的街道上没发现任何生命活动的迹象。我怀着沉重的心情一路摸索着往前走。巨大的城堡黑咕隆咚地蹲在山顶，若隐若现，里面看不到一丝光亮。吊桥是放着的，宽大的城门敞开着，我畅通无阻地走了进去，耳边只有我自己脚后跟发出的声音——走在那些空旷的院子里，真像走在坟墓中一样。","Of course, I meant to take the train for Camelot.Train! 　Why, the station was as vacant as a cavern.I moved on. 　The journey to Camelot was a repetition of what I had already seen.The Monday and the Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday.I arrived far in the night.From being the best electric-lighted town in the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw, it was become simply a blot—a blot upon darkness—that is to say, it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness, and so you could see it a little better; it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical—a sort of sign that the Church was going to KEEP the upper hand now, and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that.I found no life stirring in the somber streets.I groped my way with a heavy heart.The vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop, not a spark visible about it.The drawbridge was down, the great gate stood wide, I entered without challenge, my own heels making the only sound I heard—and it was sepulchral enough, in those huge vacant courts."
"第四十二章　战争！","CHAPTER 42 War!"
"第四十三章　沙脊带之战","CHAPTER 43 The Battle of the Sand Belt"
"在默林的山洞里——有克拉伦斯，我，和五十二名年轻的英国男孩，他们朝气蓬勃，聪明伶俐，受过良好的教育，心地纯洁。天刚亮，我就向各工厂和我们的各大工事下达了命令：停止运营，将人员转移到安全地带，因为所有的一切都将被秘密地雷给炸飞，“而且说不定在什么时刻——因此，马上撤离。”这些人都很了解我，对我的话深信不疑。他们会立刻搬空，连头发都来不及分，而我则可以有充分的时间来确定爆炸的日期了。即使过了一百年，只要爆炸还没发生，你要花钱雇他们当中任何一个回来都不可能。","IN Merlin’s Cave—Clarence and I and fifty-two fresh, bright, well-educated, clean-minded young British boys.At dawn I sent an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop operations and remove all life to a safe distance, as everything was going to be blown up by secret mines, “AND NO TELLING AT WHAT MOMENT—THEREFORE, VACATE AT ONCE.” 　These people knew me, and had confidence in my word.They would clear out without waiting to part their hair, and I could take my own time about dating the explosion.You couldn’t hire one of them to go back during the century, if the explosion was still impending."
"我们等了一个礼拜。这段时间我倒没感觉乏味，因为我一直在写东西。在头三天，我把原来的日记改写成了这种叙述形式，只差一两章就可以写到最近发生的事情了。我用这个礼拜其余的几天给我妻子写信。我一直保持着每天给桑迪写信的习惯，只要我俩不在一起我就写，现在我仍保持这个习惯，是因为我爱上了写信，当然也因为爱她，尽管我写这些信什么用也没有，尽管这样，我还是要写。不过你瞧，这样还是可以打发时间，而且几乎跟交谈一样；简直就像我正在说，“桑迪，如果你和总机都在这个山洞里，而不是只有你们的照片，那我们该多么开心啊！”而且，你知道，我还能想象出来小宝宝把小手放在嘴里，仰面躺在妈妈怀里，咿咿呀呀不知说了些什么来回答我，而当妈的则笑个不停，对她又是爱恋又是崇拜，时不时还胳肢一下孩子的下巴颏儿，让她咯咯笑个不停，然后也许自己还蹦出三言两语来回应我——等等等等——嗯，你知道吗，我可以坐在山洞里，拿着笔，就这样跟她们谈上几个钟头。嗨，这不跟我们一家子团聚差不了多少嘛。","We had a week of waiting.It was not dull for me, because I was writing all the time.During the first three days, I finished turning my old diary into this narrative form; it only required a chapter or so to bring it down to date.The rest of the week I took up in writing letters to my wife.It was always my habit to write to Sandy every day, whenever we were separate, and now I kept up the habit for love of it, and of her, though I couldn’t do anything with the letters, of course, after I had written them.But it put in the time, you see, and was almost like talking; it was almost as if I was saying, “Sandy, if you and Hello-Central were here in the cave, instead of only your photographs, what good times we could have!” 　And then, you know, I could imagine the baby googooing something out in reply, with its fists in its mouth and itself stretched across its mother’s lap on its back, and she a-laughing and admiring and worshiping, and now and then tickling under the baby’s chin to set it cackling, and then maybe throwing in a word of answer to me herself—and so on and so on—well, don’t you know, I could sit there in the cave with my pen, and keep it up, that way, by the hour with them.Why, it was almost like having us all together again."
"当然，每天晚上我都派探子出去打探消息。一份份报告让事情看起来越来越震撼人心了。大队人马正不断地聚集，聚集；在英国的大路小道上到处都是骑士们策马而行，还有教士跟他们一起，为了鼓舞这些最初的十字军们，因为这是为教会而战。所有的贵族，不论大小，都上路了，还有全部的绅士。这正是我们所期待的。我们应该把这类人都清理干净，这样一来人民就可以什么都不用做，只需要大步走上前来，站到他们的共和国一边，然后——","I had spies out every night, of course, to get news.Every report made things look more and more impressive.The hosts were gathering, gathering; down all the roads and paths of England the knights were riding, and priests rode with them, to hearten these original Crusaders, this being the Church’s war. 　All the nobilities, big and little, were on their way, and all the gentry.This was all as was expected.We should thin out this sort of folk to such a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step to the front with their republic and—"
"啊呀，我真是个笨蛋！一个礼拜都快过去了我才开始如梦方醒，从头脑中理清这样一个重大的事实：全国的人民大众曾挥舞着帽子，为共和国而欢呼，只不过一天，就结束了！教会，贵族和绅士们紧接着就耍起好大威风，对他们不满地皱起眉头，一下子让他们都缩起头来，都变成了绵羊！从那刻起，绵羊们就开始往羊圈里聚集——也就是说，营地里——还主动将他们不值钱的生命和值钱的羊毛来献给那“正义的事业。”唉，甚至还有那些刚刚从奴隶身份中解脱出来的人，也加入了这“正义的事业”，并为此而颂扬祈祷，讲得有声有色，唾沫四溅，就跟其他平民没什么不同。想想吧，天底下怎么会有这种人渣，想想这份愚蠢吧！","Ah, what a donkey I was!Toward the end of the week I began to get this large and disenchanting fact through my head: that the mass of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for about one day, and there an end!The Church, the nobles, and the gentry then turned one grand, alldisapproving frown upon them and shriveled them into sheep!From that moment the sheep had begun to gather to the fold—that is to say, the camps—and offer their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the “righteous cause.” 　Why, even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the “righteous cause,” and glorifying it, praying for it, sentimentally slabbering over it, just like all the other commoners.Imagine such human muck as this; conceive of this folly!"
"对了，现在是到处都是“打倒共和！”——根本没有不同的声音。整个英国都在讨伐我们！说真的，事情发展到这样，完全出乎我的意料。","Yes, it was now “Death to the Republic!” everywhere—not a dissenting voice.All England was marching against us!Truly, this was more than I had bargained for."
"我密切关注着那五十二个孩子，关注他们的脸庞，他们的步伐，他们无意中流露的神态：因为所有的这些都是一种语言——是一种上天有意赋予我们的语言，在我们有秘密要保守时，让我们在关键时刻露了马脚。我很清楚，在他们脑海中，心底里，那种想法在反反复复念叨，整个英国都在讨伐我们！每重复一次，都显得更加紧迫，更要去关注，每重复一次，在他们的想象中它就变得更清晰，直到就连睡觉的时候他们也摆脱不了它，总是能听到有些模模糊糊飘忽不定的幻影在说话，整个英国——整个英国！——都在讨伐你们！我就知道早晚得这样，我就知道最终压力会大到让他们受不了，非得把话说出来，因此，我必须在那之前准备好答复——这个答复要恰当，还得能安定人心。","I watched my fifty-two boys narrowly; watched their faces, their walk, their unconscious attitudes: for all these are a language—a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency, when we have secrets which we want to keep.I knew that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again in their minds and hearts, ALL ENGLAND IS MARCHING AGAINST US! and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition, ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations, until even in their sleep they would find no rest from it, but hear the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say, ALL ENGLAND—ALL ENGLAND!—IS MARCHING AGAINST YOU!I knew all this would happen; I knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great that it would compel utterance; therefore, I must be ready with an answer at that time—an answer well chosen and tranquilizing."
"我果然做对了。这个时刻到来了。他们终于说话了。可怜的孩子们面色苍白，形容憔悴，烦躁不安，瞧着真让人不忍。起初他们的发言人几乎都发不出声音，说不出话来，不过过了一小会儿他就能言能语了。这就是他说的——而且他用的还是从我学校中学到的干净利落的现代英语：","I was right.The time came.They HAD to speak.Poor lads, it was pitiful to see, they were so pale, so worn, so troubled.At first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words; but he presently got both.This is what he said—and he put it in the neat modern English taught him in my schools:"
"“我们曾经努力要忘记自己是什么人——忘记自己是英国的孩子！我们曾经努力将理智置于情感之前，将责任置于爱情之前，我们的头脑赞成这样，可是我们的心却在责备我们。本来明摆着只有那些贵族、绅士和那两万五到三万从近来这些战争中存活下来的骑士们，而我们同德同心，没有丝毫怀疑；这五十二个少年，谁都能站在面前，说：‘他们自己选择的——那是他们自己的事。’可是想想吧！——事情发生了变化——整个英国都在讨伐我们！噢，大人，想想吧！——反省吧！——这些人难道不是我们自己的人民，不是我们的骨肉同胞吗，我们爱他们——不要让我们去毁灭自己的国家！”","“We have tried to forget what we are—English boys!We have tried to put reason before sentiment, duty before love; our minds approve, but our hearts reproach us.While apparently it was only the nobility, only the gentry, only the twenty-five or thirty thousand knights left alive out of the late wars, we were of one mind, and undisturbed by any troubling doubt; each and every one of these fifty-two lads who stand here before you, said, ‘They have chosen—it is their affair.’ 　But think!—the matter is altered—ALL ENG- LAND IS MARCHING AGAINST US!Oh, sir, consider!—reflect!—these people are our people, they are bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh, we love them—do not ask us to destroy our nation!”"
"嗯，这下子可显出未雨绸缪，有备无患的好处了。要是我没有预见到这件事，提前准备好，那个孩子可就能把我难倒了！——那样我就会无言以对了。不过我早准备好了。我说道：　","Well, it shows the value of looking ahead, and being ready for a thing when it happens.If I hadn’t foreseen this thing and been fixed, that boy would have had me!—I couldn’t have said a word.But I was fixed.I said:"
"“我的孩子们，你们说得有理，想法和做法都值得尊敬。你们现在是英国的孩子，你们还可以继续做英国的孩子，你们永远不会玷污这个名字。请不要再为此揪心了，把心放安稳吧。想想这个：当整个英国都在讨伐我们的时候，是谁打头阵？按照最普通的战争规则，是谁走在最前面？回答我。”","“My boys, your hearts are in the right place, you have thought the worthy thought, you have done the worthy thing.You are English boys, you will remain English boys, and you will keep that name unsmirched.Give yourselves no further concern, let your minds be at peace.Consider this: while all England is marching against us, who is in the van?Who, by the commonest rules of war, will march in the front?Answer me.”"
"“那些身穿铠甲、骑着马的骑士们。”","“The mounted host of mailed knights.”"
"“不错。他们有三万之多。他们行军起来不知要占多少亩地呢。如今，请注意：除了他们之外，谁也碰不到那片沙脊带！随后就会发生一段插曲！紧接着，后面那一大群老百姓就会撤退，退到别的地方该干什么干什么去了。除了贵族和绅士，别人谁也当不了骑士，在插曲之后也只有这些人能留下来随着我们的乐曲跳舞。除了这三万骑士，我们用不着再跟别人战斗，这点确定无疑。现在你们说吧，而且也应该由你们来决定。我们难道应该逃避战争，从战场上撤退吗？“","“True.They are 30,000 strong.Acres deep they will march.Now, observe: none but THEY will ever strike the sand-belt!Then there will be an episode!Immediately after, the civilian multitude in the rear will retire, to meet business engagements elsewhere.None but nobles and gentry are knights, and NONE BUT THESE will remain to dance to our music after that episode.It is absolutely true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights.Now speak, and it shall be as you decide.Shall we avoid the battle, retire from the field?”"
"“不！！！”","“NO!!!”"
"这喊声异口同声，发自肺腑。","The shout was unanimous and hearty."
"“那你们——你们——嗯，你们难道还怕这三万骑士吗？”　","“Are you—are you—well, afraid of these thirty thousand knights?”"
"这个笑话惹得大家哄堂大笑，这些孩子的烦忧烟消云散，开开心心地回到各自的位置上去了。啊，他们可真是五十二个小宝贝！而且都像小姑娘一样漂亮。","That joke brought out a good laugh, the boys’ troubles vanished away, and they went gaily to their posts.Ah, they were a darling fifty-two!As pretty as girls, too."
"如今我已经做好了应敌准备。就让那一天天临近的伟大时刻到来吧——来了就会发现我们早就准备好了等着呢。","I was ready for the enemy now.Let the approaching big day come along—it would find us on deck."
"那伟大的日子如期而至。天刚亮，在围栏那里放哨的哨兵就跑进洞里，汇报说天边有一大堆黑压压的人群正朝这边移动，还伴着一阵隐隐约约的声音，他觉得可能是军乐。早饭正好准备好了，我们就坐下来用餐。","The big day arrived on time.At dawn the sentry on watch in the corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the horizon, and a faint sound which he thought to be military music.Breakfast was just ready; we sat down and ate it."
"吃完饭，我对那些孩子们简单说了几句，然后就派了一队人去把守机关枪阵地，由克拉伦斯来指挥。","This over, I made the boys a little speech, and then sent out a detail to man the battery, with Clarence in command of it."
"不一会儿太阳升起来了，光芒四射，无可抵挡，照亮了这片土地，我们看到一支浩浩荡荡的队伍朝我们慢慢移动着，前排排成一行，如海浪般有节奏地朝前涌动着。队伍越来越近，看上去也越来越显得威武壮观了；不错，显然全英国的人都来了。很快我们就能看到数不清的旗帜在招展，随后太阳照在海洋般的铠甲上，金光闪闪。不错，真是一片美好的景象，我从没见过比这个还好看的。","The sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land, and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us, with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea.Nearer and nearer it came, and more and more sublimely imposing became its aspect; yes, all England was there, apparently.Soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering, and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash.Yes, it was a fine sight; I hadn’t ever seen anything to beat it."
"我们终于能看个真切了。前面那几排，说不清能占多少亩地，全是骑兵——头戴盔缨身穿铠甲的骑士。突然间我们听到一阵号角声，本来的慢步前进突然变成了疾速狂奔，然后——噢，看上去真够绝了！马蹄如惊涛骇浪般卷土而来——离那片沙脊带不远了——我的呼吸都停止了；越来越近，越来越近——绿色草地与黄色沙土之间那条长带也越来越窄——越来越窄——变成了马匹跟前的一根丝带——接着就消失在马蹄之下了。啊呀天哪！前面的人马随着一声霹雳巨响，全都冲向了天空，卷起一阵由破布和尸体碎片组成的旋风，沿着地面燃起了滚滚浓烟，像一堵墙一样把剩下的人群从我们眼前挡了起来。","At last we could make out details.All the front ranks, no telling how many acres deep, were horsemen—plumed knights in armor.Suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets; the slow walk burst into a gallop, and then—well, it was wonderful to see!Down swept that vast horse-shoe wave—it approached the sand-belt—my breath stood still; nearer, nearer—the strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt grew narrow—narrower still—became a mere ribbon in front of the horses—then disappeared under their hoofs.Great Scott!Why, the whole front of that host shot into the sky with a thunder-crash, and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments; and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude from our sight."
"实行第二步作战计划的时刻到了！我按了一个按钮，就把英国震得骨头和脊梁分了家！","Time for the second step in the plan of campaign!I touched a button, and shook the bones of England loose from her spine!"
"在爆炸中我们所有珍贵的文明工厂都飞上天，从地球上消失了。真是可惜，不过也是情非得已。我们不能让敌人用我们的武器反过来对付我们。","In that explosion all our noble civilization-factories went up in the air and disappeared from the earth.It was a pity, but it was necessary.We could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us."
"现在我人生要忍受的最乏味的一刻钟到来了。我们在一圈圈铁丝和铁丝外那层浓烟包围下等待着，默不作声，一片寂静。我们无法从那墙壁般的浓雾上看过去，也无法透过它看见什么。不过它最终还是懒洋洋地散开了，又一刻钟之后，地面也清楚了，我们的好奇心自然也就能够得到满足了。眼前一个活物也没有！此时我们注意到，我们的防御工事里多了点东西。炸药炸出了一条一百英尺宽的沟，又在沟的两侧各堆积出二十五英尺高的堤坝。而炸死的活物就更让人吃惊了。而且也无法估计。当然，死人我们是数不过来的，因为他们都不是以单个形式存在的，而只是些同类原生质，里面掺杂着铁片和纽扣。","Now ensued one of the dullest quarter-hours I had ever endured.We waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire, and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these.We couldn’t see over the wall of smoke, and we couldn’t see through it.But at last it began to shred away lazily, and by the end of another quarter-hour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled to satisfy itself.No living creature was in sight!We now perceived that additions had been made to our defenses.The dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide, all around us, and cast up an embankment some twenty-five feet high on both borders of it.As to destruction of life, it was amazing.Moreover, it was beyond estimate.Of course, we could not COUNT the dead, because they did not exist as individuals, but merely as homogeneous protoplasm, with alloys of iron and buttons."
"眼前一个活物也没有，不过不可避免的在后排肯定有些受了伤的，借着墙一般的浓烟被人抬下了战场，其余的人也会有些得病的——在这样的插曲之后这种事情是在所难免的。可是增援是不会有的，这是英国骑士制度的最后一战了，经历了最近几场毁灭性的战争，这个阶层就剩下这么多人了。因此我敢打包票，今后能派来对付我们的人不会太多了，我是说骑士。因此我发表了一个公告，向我的军队祝捷，内容如下：","No life was in sight, but necessarily there must have been some wounded in the rear ranks, who were carried off the field under cover of the wall of smoke; there would be sickness among the others—there always is, after an episode like that.But there would be no reinforcements; this was the last stand of the chivalry of England; it was all that was left of the order, after the recent annihilating wars.So I felt quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future be brought against us would be but small; that is, of knights.I therefore issued a congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words:"
"战士们，人类自由和平等的斗士们：你们的将军向你们表示祝贺！傲慢的敌人自负强大，威震天下，竟然前来攻打你们。而你们早已严阵以待。斗争非常短暂，荣耀是属于你们的。这次伟大的胜利，我方毫发无损，堪称史无前例。只要日月星辰还继续按照它们的轨道转动，这场沙带之战就永远不会从人类的记忆中消失。","SOLDIERS, CHAMPIONS OF HUMAN LIBERTY AND EQUALITY: Your General congratulates you!In the pride of his strength and the vanity of his renown, an arrogant enemy came against you.You were ready.The conflict was brief; on your side, glorious.This mighty victory, having been achieved utterly without loss, stands without example in history.So long as the planets shall continue to move in their orbits, the BATTLE OF THE SAND-BELT will not perish out of the memories of men."
"头子。","THE BOSS."
"我朗朗读了一遍，得到的掌声使我很满足。接着我又以这番话作为结束语：　","I read it well, and the applause I got was very gratifying to me. 　I then wound up with these remarks:"
"“与英国民族的战争，就整个民族而言，已然告一段落。这个民族已经从战场上，从战争中，退却了。等不到它被劝说要卷土重来，战争已经不复存在了。这一仗是唯一要打的一仗。这仗会很短暂——空前绝后的短暂。而且从死伤和作战人数比例的角度来讲，这仗也是最具杀伤性的。我们和这个民族已经没有关系了；从此以后我们只要对付那些骑士就行了。英国的骑士能够被杀死，但不会被征服。我们很清楚摆在我们面前的形势。只要这些人中有一个人还活着，我们的任务就不会结束，战争就不会停止。我们要把他们斩尽杀绝。”　（经久不衰的掌声。）","“The war with the English nation, as a nation, is at an end.The nation has retired from the field and the war.Before it can be persuaded to return, war will have ceased.This campaign is the only one that is going to be fought.It will be brief—the briefest in history.Also the most destructive to life, considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to numbers engaged.We are done with the nation; henceforth we deal only with the knights.English knights can be killed, but they cannot be conquered.We know what is before us. 　While one of these men remains alive, our task is not finished, the war is not ended.We will kill them all.” 　[Loud and long continued applause.]"
"我派了个纠察队去防线周围被炸药炸出的那两条大堤坝上巡逻——只不过是找了几个孩子，叫他们只要一看到敌人再次露面就告诉我。","I picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by the dynamite explosion—merely a lookout of a couple of boys to announce the enemy when he should appear again."
"随即，我又派了一位工程师带领四十人去南边我们防线的一个地方，去将那里的山涧改个方向，让它流入我们的防线，好听从我们的指挥，如此这般将它安排好，在紧急时刻我可以马上加以利用。那四十人被分做两班，二十人一班，两个钟头一换班。用了十个小时工程就完成了。","Next, I sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our lines on the south, to turn a mountain brook that was there, and bring it within our lines and under our command, arranging it in such a way that I could make instant use of it in an emergency.The forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each, and were to relieve each other every two hours.In ten hours the work was accomplished."
"此刻夜幕已经降临了，我把哨兵也撤了回来。在北边放哨的那个报告说看到了一处军营，不过用望远镜才能看清。他还报告说有几个骑士曾经试探着朝我们走来，还把几头牛赶进了我们的防线，不过他们自己却没有靠近。一切都不出我所料。你明白吧，他们在试探我们，他们想知道我们会不会再对他们发动那种赤色恐怖。也许到了夜里他们的胆子就会大起来了。我敢说他们有什么企图我是一清二楚，因为事情再简单不过了，换做我在他们的处境下，也和他们一样白痴，我也会那么做的。我把这点跟克拉伦斯说了。","It was nightfall now, and I withdrew my pickets.The one who had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight, but visible with the glass only.He also reported that a few knights had been feeling their way toward us, and had driven some cattle across our lines, but that the knights themselves had not come very near.That was what I had been expecting.They were feeling us, you see; they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror on them again.They would grow bolder in the night, perhaps.I believed I knew what project they would attempt, because it was plainly the thing I would attempt myself if I were in their places and as ignorant as they were.I mentioned it to Clarence."
"“我认为你想得很对，”他说，“他们明摆着是要试一试。”","“I think you are right,” said he; “it is the obvious thing for them to try.”"
"“嗯，那就好，”我说道，“要是敢试他们就死定了。”　","“Well, then,” I said, “if they do it they are doomed.”　"
"“那是当然。”","“Certainly.”"
"“他们甭想再在这个世界露上一面了。”","“They won’t have the slightest show in the world.”"
"“当然露不了了。”","“Of course they won’t.”"
"“太可怕了，克拉伦斯。好像太可怜了。”","“It’s dreadful, Clarence.It seems an awful pity.”"
"这件事搞得我七上八下，心里一刻不得安宁，因为老是惦记着，老是为了它担忧。因此，到最后为了安定一下我的良心，我起草了这样一个致众骑士的通牒：","The thing disturbed me so that I couldn’t get any peace of mind for thinking of it and worrying over it.So, at last, to quiet my conscience, I framed this message to the knights:"
"谋反叛乱的英国骑士司令官阁下：你们的战斗是徒劳的。我们很清楚你们的兵力——如果那也能称作是兵力的话。我们知道你们能够调动的兵力最多也就两万五千骑士。因此，你们没有机会了——什么机会也没有了。想想看吧，我们装备精良，堡垒坚固，我们还有五十四个之多。五十四个什么？人？不，是头脑——世上最精干的头脑，就凭你们那些野兽的蛮力还想和这股力量抗争，取胜的希望简直和懒洋洋的海浪要跟英国花岗岩海岸抗争的希望差不多。听从劝告吧。我们会饶你们不死，为了你们的家人着想，不要拒绝这份恩赐。我们给你们一次机会，这可是最后一次了：扔下你们的武器，向共和国无条件投降，一切既往不咎。","TO THE HONORABLE THE COMMANDER OF THE INSURGENT CHIVALRY OF ENGLAND: YOU fight in vain.We know your strength—if one may call it by that name.We know that at the utmost you cannot bring against us above five and twenty thousand knights.Therefore, you have no chance—none whatever.Reflect: we are well equipped, well fortified, we number 54.Fifty-four what?Men? 　No, MINDS—the capablest in the world; a force against which mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than may the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail against the granite barriers of England.Be advised.We offer you your lives; for the sake of your families, do not reject the gift.We offer you this chance, and it is the last: throw down your arms; surrender unconditionally to the Republic, and all will be forgiven."
"（签名）头子　","(Signed) THE BOSS."
"我把它念给克拉伦斯听，说我打算派人打着休战旗给送过去。他露出天生那付讥讽的笑容，笑着说道：","I read it to Clarence, and said I proposed to send it by a flag of truce.He laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with, and said:"
"“不知怎么，要让你彻底明白这些贵族都是什么样的人，似乎不大可能。现在我们就省点时间，少找点麻烦吧。你就当我是那些骑士的司令官好了。嗯，好吧，你就是扛着休战旗的人，你走过来，把通牒递交给我，我会给你答复的。”","“Somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what these nobilities are.Now let us save a little time and trouble.Consider me the commander of the knights yonder.Now, then, you are the flag of truce; approach and deliver me your message, and I will give you your answer.”"
"我顺从了他的主意。我想象着自己在戒备森严的敌营，走上前来，拿出我的通牒，从头到尾念了一遍。作为答复，克拉伦斯一把将我手中的通牒打落在地，撅起嘴唇，连讥带讽，目中无人，不屑一顾地说道：","I humored the idea.I came forward under an imaginary guard of the enemy’s soldiers, produced my paper, and read it through.For answer, Clarence struck the paper out of my hand, pursed up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain:"
"“把这个畜生给我剁成八瓣，装到篮子里，交还给派他来的那个出身卑贱的恶棍，别的回话一概没有！”","“Dismember me this animal, and return him in a basket to the base-born knave who sent him; other answer have I none!”"
"在事实面前理论是多么空洞！而这就是事实，不是别的。这种事情肯定会发生的，甭想绕开。我将那张纸一把撕碎，让我那份不合时宜的软心肠永远地歇着去了。","How empty is theory in presence of fact!And this was just fact, and nothing else.It was the thing that would have happened, there was no getting around that.I tore up the paper and granted my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest."
"接下来该办正事了。我检测了一下从机关枪阵地通到山洞的那些电子信号，确保它们一切正常；我还反复测试了一下控制铁丝网的那些信号——通过这些信号我可以切断或者接通每一片铁丝网的电流，而不用管其他的铁丝网。我派了三个最优秀的小伙子去看守和监管那条小溪上的接头，他们两个小时一轮班，彻夜看守，只等我一声令下，他们会马上遵从我的信号——左轮手枪连发三枪。晚上的哨兵也撤掉了，栅栏那边空无一人。我还下令山洞里也不要出声，电灯都调暗，只发出微弱的光。","Then, to business.I tested the electric signals from the gatling platform to the cave, and made sure that they were all right; I tested and retested those which commanded the fences—these were signals whereby I could break and renew the electric current in each fence independently of the others at will.I placed the brook-connection under the guard and authority of three of my best boys, who would alternate in two-hour watches all night and promptly obey my signal, if I should have occasion to give it—three revolvershots in quick succession.Sentry-duty was discarded for the night, and the corral left empty of life; I ordered that quiet be maintained in the cave, and the electric lights turned down to a glimmer."
"天刚黑透，我就将所有铁丝网的电流都给掐掉了，然后摸着黑走到靠我们这边的大堤坝上，就是上次炸出来的那个大沟边上。我爬上了坝顶，躺在一片狼藉的斜坡上，开始守望。不过天太黑了，什么也看不见。至于声音，也是一点也听不见。死一般的寂静。不错，乡村平时夜里的声音还是有的——夜里鸟儿拍打翅膀的声音，昆虫嗡嗡的叫声，还有远处汪汪狗叫，牛儿低沉的哞声——可是这些声音并没有打破这寂静，反而使它愈加加剧了，还给这次交手增添了令人毛骨悚然的凄凉意味。","As soon as it was good and dark, I shut off the current from all the fences, and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering our side of the great dynamite ditch.I crept to the top of it and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch.But it was too dark to see anything.As for sounds, there were none.The stillness was deathlike.True, there were the usual night-sounds of the country—the whir of nightbirds, the buzzing of insects, the barking of distant dogs, the mellow lowing of far-off kine—but these didn’t seem to break the stillness, they only intensified it, and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain."
"很快我就放弃了瞭望，夜幕降临，一片漆黑，什么也看不见，不过我支棱着耳朵，一点可疑的声音也不放过，此时我断定，只要等下去，总不会让我失望的。然而，这一等时间可够长的。我最终还是听到了，听到了勉强能称之为声音，一闪就不见了的那种，是沉闷的金属声音。我支棱起耳朵，接着又屏住了呼吸，我等待的就是这个。声音变得沉重起来，越来越近了——是从北面传来的。不久我就听出来，声音来到了和我同一高度的地方——对面堤坝的坝梁上，离这儿大约一百多英尺远。接着，我好像看到了有一排黑点沿着坝梁出现了——是人的脑袋？我说不上来，也许什么都不是；一个人若是想象力发散开来，眼睛也就靠不住了。不过问题很快就解决了。我听到那金属声往下走了，进了大壕沟。声音在快速扩大，在沟底扩散开来，毋庸置疑它要告诉我这样一个事实：一支全副武装的军队正在沟底安营扎寨呢。不错，这些人正在安排为我们准备个惊喜派对呢。天亮时分我们就有的乐了，也许还能更早一点。","I presently gave up looking, the night shut down so black, but I kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound, for I judged I had only to wait, and I shouldn’t be disappointed.However, I had to wait a long time.At last I caught what you may call in distinct glimpses of sound, a dulled metallic sound.I pricked up my ears, then, and held my breath, for this was the sort of thing I had been waiting for.This sound thickened, and approached—from toward the north.Presently, I heard it at my own level—the ridge-top of the opposite embankment, a hundred feet or more away.Then I seemed to see a row of black dots appear along that ridge—human heads?I couldn’t tell; it mightn’t be anything at all; you can’t depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.However, the question was soon settled.I heard that metallic noise descending into the great ditch.It augmented fast, it spread all along, and it unmistakably furnished me this fact: an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch.Yes, these people were arranging a little surprise party for us. 　We could expect entertainment about dawn, possibly earlier."
"此时我又摸索着回到了栅栏处，我看得足够了。我来到高台上，发出信号，让他们将电流接到里面的两圈铁丝网上。随后我又进到山洞里，发现一切都令人满意——除了值班的人外，大家都在睡觉。我把克拉伦斯叫醒，告诉他壕沟里现在全是人，而且我相信那帮骑士肯定是倾巢出动，都朝我们来了。在我看来，只要天一亮，埋伏在壕沟里的千军万马就会蜂拥而出，越过堤坝，发动进攻，其他的大军也会马上随后而至。","I groped my way back to the corral now; I had seen enough.I went to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two inner fences.Then I went into the cave, and found everything satisfactory there—nobody awake but the working-watch.I woke Clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men, and that I believed all the knights were coming for us in a body.It was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect the ditch’s ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment and make an assault, and be followed immediately by the rest of their army."
"克拉伦斯说道：","Clarence said:"
"“天不亮他们就会派一两个侦察兵过来预先勘察一番。为什么不把外围的铁丝网都撤了电，给他们个机会呢？”","“They will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make preliminary observations.Why not take the lightning off the outer fences, and give them a chance?”"
"“我已经那么做了，克拉伦斯。你什么时候看到过我不热情好客了？”　","“I’ve already done it, Clarence.Did you ever know me to be inhospitable?”"
"“没有，你一直都是好心肠。我想去——”","“No, you are a good heart.I want to go and—”"
"“当个招待委员？我也去。”","“Be a reception committee?I will go, too.”"
"我们穿过了栅栏，在里层的两道铁丝网之间一起躺了下来。即使是山洞里传来的微弱光线，也或多或少干扰了我们的视线，不过我们的视力马上就进行了自我调整，很快就适应了目前的环境。之前我们还得摸着走路，现在能看清铁丝网的桩子了。我们开始小声谈了起来，突然间克拉伦斯煞住话头，说道：","We crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside fences.Even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight somewhat, but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and soon it was adjusted for present circumstances.We had had to feel our way before, but we could make out to see the fence posts now. 　We started a whispered conversation, but suddenly Clarence broke off and said:"
"“那是什么？”","“What is that?”"
"“什么是什么？”","“What is what?”"
"“远处那个东西。”","“That thing yonder.”"
"“什么东西——在哪儿？”","“What thing—where?”"
"“就在离你不远的地方——黑乎乎的一个东西——形状不大清楚——就靠着第二层铁丝网。”","“There beyond you a little piece—dark something—a dull shape of some kind—against the second fence.”"
"我盯着看，他也盯着看。我说道：","I gazed and he gazed.I said:"
"“不会是个人吧，克拉伦斯？”","“Could it be a man, Clarence?”"
"“不会，我不这么认为。你要是注意看，它有点——啊呀，真是个人！——靠在铁丝网上。”","“No, I think not. 　If you notice, it looks a lit—why, it IS a man!—leaning on the fence.”"
"“我敢肯定那是个人，我们过去看看吧。”","“I certainly believe it is; let us go and see.”"
"我们手脚并用向前爬着走，一直爬到很近了，才抬头望去。不错，那正是个人——一个模模糊糊的高大身影，穿着铠甲，直挺挺站着，双手都抓在上面的铁丝上——当然啦，还伴有一股肉烧焦了的味道。可怜的家伙，死得跟个门钉似的，永远也不会明白自己是怎么送的命。他站在那儿，像尊雕像——纹丝不动，只有盔缨在夜风中微微飘动，嗖嗖作响。我们站起身来，透过他的面盔望过去，不过还是无法辨认我们是否认识这个人——五官因为太昏暗而模糊不清。","We crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close, and then looked up.Yes, it was a man—a dim great figure in armor, standing erect, with both hands on the upper wire—and, of course, there was a smell of burning flesh.Poor fellow, dead as a door-nail, and never knew what hurt him.He stood there like a statue—no motion about him, except that his plumes swished about a little in the night wind.We rose up and looked in through the bars of his visor, but couldn’t make out whether we knew him or not—features too dim and shadowed."
"我们听到那低沉的声音慢慢逼近了，于是原地蹲了下来。我们影影绰绰看到另一位骑士，他蹑手蹑脚，探着路过来了。此时他离我们很近了，我们能看到他伸出一只手来，摸着上面一根铁丝，接着弯下腰，从上下两根铁丝间钻了过去。这时他来到了第一位骑士身边——看到后者时他稍微有点吃惊。他站了一会儿——肯定是在纳闷，为什么那人不往前走了呢。随后他低声说道：“你怎么在这儿做起梦来了，亲爱的爵士玛——”接着他把手放到了尸体的肩膀上——只发出一声微弱的呻吟，然后就倒地身亡。你瞧，被死人给杀死了——事实上，是被死去的朋友给杀死了。想想真可怕。","We heard muffled sounds approaching, and we sank down to the ground where we were.We made out another knight vaguely; he was coming very stealthily, and feeling his way. 　He was near enough now for us to see him put out a hand, find an upper wire, then bend and step under it and over the lower one.Now he arrived at the first knight—and started slightly when he discovered him.He stood a moment—no doubt wondering why the other one didn’t move on; then he said, in a low voice, “Why dreamest thou here, good Sir Mar—” then he laid his hand on the corpse’s shoulder—and just uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead.Killed by a dead man, you see—killed by a dead friend, in fact.There was something awful about it."
"这些早起的鸟儿们一个接着一个，陆陆续续来了，半小时之内，每隔五分钟就有一个来到我们附近。他们除了长剑之外什么进攻武器也没带，无一例外，他们都会提早将长剑握在手里，将它往前一伸来探铁丝。我们时不时会看到蓝色火花，而那位弄出火花的骑士离我们却远着呢，根本看不到。不过我们清楚发生了什么，都一样，可怜的家伙，他拿剑去碰带电的铁丝，算是被死神选中了。他一倒地，身上的铁甲就会发出哐啷哐啷的声音，这可怜而有规律的声音之后便是短暂阴森的寂静。这样的一而再，再而三，在这黑咕隆咚、空无一人的地方，格外让人不寒而栗，毛骨悚然。","These early birds came scattering along after each other, about one every five minutes in our vicinity, during half an hour.They brought no armor of offense but their swords; as a rule, they carried the sword ready in the hand, and put it forward and found the wires with it.We would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us; but we knew what had happened, all the same; poor fellow, he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been elected.We had brief intervals of grim stillness, interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron-clad; and this sort of thing was going on, right along, and was very creepy there in the dark and lonesomeness."
"我们决定在里面的铁丝网之间巡游一番。为了方便起见，我们选择直起身来走；我们想，一旦被发现了，别人也会当我们是自己人，而不是敌人，无论在什么情况下我们只要呆在剑够不着的地方就行了，反正这些绅士们大概也不会随身带着长矛。嗯，这趟旅行很有趣。走到哪儿都能看到死尸躺在第二层铁丝网外——虽然看不大清楚，不过仍能看得到；我们数了数，这种可怜的雕像一共有十五尊——都是僵死的骑士，站在那里，手放在上边的铁丝上。","We concluded to make a tour between the inner fences.We elected to walk upright, for convenience’s sake; we argued that if discerned, we should be taken for friends rather than enemies, and in any case we should be out of reach of swords, and these gentry did not seem to have any spears along.Well, it was a curious trip.Everywhere dead men were lying outside the second fence—not plainly visible, but still visible; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic statues—dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire."
"有一件事似乎得到了充分的证明：我们的电流如此之巨大，还没等这些受害者喊出声来，就将他们给杀死了。不一会儿我们就察觉到有一种低缓而沉重的声音传来，紧接着我们就猜出是怎么回事了。突袭大部队来了！我悄声示意克拉伦斯去把军队唤醒，并通知他们在山洞里保持安静，等待进一步命令。没过多久他就回来了，我们站在里面那层铁丝网那儿，等着看那无声的闪电对蜂拥而至的大军来施展它的威力。谁要是想看仔细是不大可能的，不过还是能看到黑压压一大群人正在第二层铁丝网外不断堆积着。那持续增长的一大堆都是死人！我们的营地被一堵密不透风的死人墙给围了起来——你可以说它是一道堡垒，一堵胸墙，由尸体堆积而成。这件事最可怕的地方在于，没有一点人类的声音；没有欢呼，没有战争的哀号；因为一心要搞突然袭击，这班人行进起来尽量不发出一点声响；回回都是这样，前排的人接近了目标，觉得时机合适，正准备开始喊，就自然而然地碰到了那条致命的防线，还没来得及跟别人证明一下就倒下死掉了。","One thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated: our current was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out.Pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound, and next moment we guessed what it was.It was a surprise in force coming!I whispered Clarence to go and wake the army, and notify it to wait in silence in the cave for further orders.He was soon back, and we stood by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful work upon that swarming host.One could make out but little of detail; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up beyond the second fence.That swelling bulk was dead men!Our camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead—a bulwark, a breastwork, of corpses, you may say. 　One terrible thing about this thing was the absence of human voices; there were no cheers, no war cries; being intent upon a surprise, these men moved as noiselessly as they could; and always when the front rank was near enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get a shout ready, of course they struck the fatal line and went down without testifying."
"我现在将第三层铁丝网也通上了电流；紧接着又是第四层，第五层，那些空缺填补得也太快了。我坚信此刻正是我推出高潮的时刻，我坚信整个大部队都在我们的圈套之内了。不管怎么说，是时候查看一番了。因此我摁下一个按钮，五十盏电灯如太阳般在悬崖顶上大放光明。","I sent a current through the third fence now; and almost immediately through the fourth and fifth, so quickly were the gaps filled up. 　I believed the time was come now for my climax; I believed that that whole army was in our trap.Anyway, it was high time to find out.So I touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame on the top of our precipice."
"老天，这是怎样一番景象啊！我们被足足三层死人墙给围了起来！其余的铁丝网里也都几乎装满了活人，他们正偷偷摸摸穿过铁丝网朝前走。突如其来的亮光让这队人都僵住了，简直可以说是大吃一惊、呆若木鸡了，要利用他们这种动弹不得的境况，只容我有一眨眼的瞬间，而我也没有错失良机。你瞧，再一眨眼他们又会都复活，接着顿时齐声欢呼，冲过来，到时候我那些铁丝就会倒了。不过他们错失了这一瞬间，可就把机会永远错过了，这短暂的瞬间还没过去，我就让电流通过了所有的铁丝网，把整支大军当场击毙了！这下你可听见了，是一片呻吟声！它道出了一万一千人临死前的痛苦。夜空里弥漫着可怕的哀怨声。","Land, what a sight!We were enclosed in three walls of dead men!All the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living, who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires.The sudden glare paralyzed this host, petrified them, you may say, with astonishment; there was just one instant for me to utilize their immobility in, and I didn’t lose the chance.You see, in another instant they would have recovered their faculties, then they’d have burst into a cheer and made a rush, and my wires would have gone down before it; but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever; while even that slight fragment of time was still unspent, I shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks!THERE was a groan you could HEAR!It voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand men.It swelled out on the night with awful pathos."
"一瞥之下，就能看到其余的敌人——或许有一万多人吧——正位于我们和环绕我们的壕沟之间，正蜂拥向前要来攻击我们。结果呢，我们把他们全网罗住了！而且让他们孤立无援了。悲剧最后一幕的时间到了。我将左轮手枪按预定方案放了三枪——那就是说：","A glance showed that the rest of the enemy—perhaps ten thousand strong—were between us and the encircling ditch, and pressing forward to the assault.Consequently we had them ALL! and had them past help.Time for the last act of the tragedy.I fired the three appointed revolver shots—which meant:"
"“放水！”","“Turn on the water!”"
"顿时间一片汹涌咆哮，不出一分钟，那条山涧就涌入了大壕沟，行成了一条一百英尺宽、二十五英尺深的大河。","There was a sudden rush and roar, and in a minute the mountain brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twentyfive deep."
"“准备好枪，兄弟们！开火！”","“Stand to your guns, men!Open fire!”"
"十三挺格林机关枪开始朝那在劫难逃的一万人吐出死亡之弹。他们停住了，迎着摧枯拉朽的枪林弹雨在原地只挺了一分钟，紧接着就四散奔逃，转过头去向壕沟那边游去，就跟大风吹过的谷壳似的。足足有四分之一的兵力没有爬上那高高的大坝顶端；剩下的四分之三爬上去了，然后一头跳下去——都淹死了。","The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand.They halted, they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire, then they broke, faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale.A full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment; the three-fourths reached it and plunged over—to death by drowning."
"我们开火之后不过短短的十分钟，武装抵抗就全部被消灭了，战争结束了，我们五十四个人成了英国的主人。而我们周围有两万五千人躺在那里，死掉了。","Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistance was totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we fifty-four were masters of England.Twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us."
"可是命运也太反复无常了！就过了一小会儿——能有一个小时——发生了一件事情，是我的过错，那是——可是我没心情写这个了。就让记录在这里结束吧。","But how treacherous is fortune!In a little while—say an hour—happened a thing, by my own fault, which—but I have no heart to write that.Let the record end here."
"第四十四章　克拉伦斯的后记","CHAPTER 44 A Postscript by Clarence"
"我，克拉伦斯，不得不替他写。他提议我俩出去看看，看那些受伤的是不是还有救。我竭力反对这个计划。我说如果他们受伤人很多，我们也帮不了什么忙，而且无论如何我们大着胆子跑到他们当中去也不是个明智的主意。可是他一旦打定了主意，很少能拉回头，于是我们就将铁丝网的电流都关掉，带了一支护卫队，爬过那圈由死去的骑士堆成的堡垒，朝外边的战地走了过去。第一个向我们求助的伤员坐在那里，背靠着一个死去的同伴。当头子弯下腰来，对那人开口说话时，那人认出了头子，一剑捅了过去。那位骑士是梅利阿格朗斯爵士，我把他的头盔摘下来发现是他。他再也不会呼救了。","I, CLARENCE, must write it for him.He proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded.I was strenuous against the project.I said that if there were many, we could do but little for them; and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them, anyway.But he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed; so we shut off the electric current from the fences, took an escort along, climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights, and moved out upon the field.The first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade.When The Boss bent over him and spoke to him, the man recognized him and stabbed him.That knight was Sir Meliagraunce, as I found out by tearing off his helmet.He will not ask for help any more."
"我们把头子抬回了山洞，竭尽所能照顾他，好在他伤得不算重。照顾时默林也来搭了把手，尽管我们毫不知情。他伪装成个女人，看上去就是个心地单纯的老农妇。靠着这伪装，染成棕色的脸，胡子剃得光光的，他在头子受伤后没几天就出现了，主动提出来给我们做饭，说她家里的人都去参加敌人正在组建的新阵营去了，她都快饿死了。头子伤势恢复得很好，为了自己找点乐子，正在写他那记录的最后一部分。","We carried The Boss to the cave and gave his wound, which was not very serious, the best care we could.In this service we had the help of Merlin, though we did not know it. 　He was disguised as a woman, and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife.In this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth shaven, he had appeared a few days after The Boss was hurt and offered to cook for us, saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming, and that she was starving.The Boss had been getting along very well, and had amused himself with finishing up his record."
"我们很高兴地接纳了这个女人，因为我们正缺人手呢。你瞧，我们现在可是中了圈套了——而且还是我们自己造的圈套。要是我们呆在原地，那些死人也会要了我们的命；但要是我们搬出防御工事，我们就不再是天下无敌了。我们战胜了别人，反过来我们也被别人给战胜了。头子意识到了这点，我们全都意识到了。如果我们能到那些新营地当中的一个去走走，跟敌人探讨出和谈的条件——不错，不过头子去不了，我也去不了，因为我是头一个得病的，就是被那成千上万的死人产生的毒气给熏倒的。其他人也都陆陆续续病倒了。明天——","We were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed.We were in a trap, you see—a trap of our own making.If we stayed where we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our defenses, we should no longer be invincible.We had conquered; in turn we were conquered.The Boss recognized this; we all recognized it. 　If we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy—yes, but The Boss could not go, and neither could I, for I was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands.Others were taken down, and still others.To-morrow—"
"明天。明天到了。一切都该结束了。半夜时分我醒了，看见那个丑老太婆正在头子的头上和脸上晃来晃去做着怪手势，不禁纳闷那是什么意思。除了看守发电机的人，大家都在酣睡当中，周围一点声音也没有。那女人停下了她装神弄鬼的动作，踮着脚尖往门外走去。我大喝一声：","TO-MORROW.It is here.And with it the end.About midnight I awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about The Boss’s head and face, and wondered what it meant.Everybody but the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound.The woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing toward the door.I called out:"
"“站住！你干了些什么？”","“Stop!What have you been doing?”"
"她停住了，用不怀好意而又得意洋洋的口气说道：","She halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:"
"“你们过去还是征服者，现在你们被征服了！你们那些人都会死掉——你也不例外。你们会死在这个地方——人人都是——除了他。他现在睡着了——而且一睡就是一千三百年。我是默林！”","“Ye were conquerors; ye are conquered!These others are perishing—you also.Ye shall all die in this place—every one—except HIM.He sleepeth now—and shall sleep thirteen centuries.I am Merlin!”"
"随即他开始胡言乱语，傻笑不已，像个醉汉似的摇摇晃晃走开了，不一会儿就撞上了一根我们的铁丝。他的嘴还在张着，很显然他还在笑呢。我猜想他的脸会一直保持这种石化的笑容，直到他的尸体变成灰尘为止。","Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one of our wires.His mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still laughing.I suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust."
"头子再也没动一下——睡得像块石头。要是他今天还没醒，我们就明白是什么样的睡眠了，他的身体会被抬到山洞深处一个隐蔽的地方，谁也不会发现，不会被祸害。至于我们这些人——嗯，大家一致同意，如果我们当中有人能活着从这个地方逃出去，就要把这儿的实况写下来，并要忠诚地将手稿与我们的头子，我们亲爱的好头领，一起藏起来，因为不管他是活着还是死了，这都是他的财产。","The Boss has never stirred—sleeps like a stone.If he does not wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it.As for the rest of us—well, it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place, he will write the fact here, and loyally hide this Manuscript with The Boss, our dear good chief, whose property it is, be he alive or dead."
"手稿终","THE END OF THE MANUSCRIPT"
"卷末附言马克·吐温","FINAL P.S.BY M.T."
"等我把手稿放到一边的时候，天都亮了。雨差不多停住了，世界灰蒙蒙的，充满了悲伤，精疲力竭的暴风雨叹息着，呜咽着，渐渐停息了。我来到那个外乡人的房间外，门虚掩着，我在门口听了一下。我能听到他的声音，于是就敲了敲门。没人回应，不过我仍能听到声音。我朝里面探头望去。那人仰面朝天躺在床上，话说得时断时续，不过精神洋溢，还用胳膊打着拍子，抡来抡去，躁动不安，就好像病人说胡话一样。我轻轻溜了进去，弯腰去看他。他还在继续咕哝着，还突然大叫几声。我开口了——只说了一句话，好引起他的注意。他那呆滞的眼睛和苍白的脸颊顿时明亮起来，又是高兴，又是感激，又是快乐，又是欢迎：","THE dawn was come when I laid the Manuscript aside.The rain had almost ceased, the world was gray and sad, the exhausted storm was sighing and sobbing itself to rest.I went to the stranger’s room, and listened at his door, which was slightly ajar.I could hear his voice, and so I knocked.There was no answer, but I still heard the voice.I peeped in.The man lay on his back in bed, talking brokenly but with spirit, and punctuating with his arms, which he thrashed about, restlessly, as sick people do in delirium.I slipped in softly and bent over him.His mutterings and ejaculations went on.I spoke—merely a word, to call his attention.His glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with pleasure, gratitude, gladness, welcome:"
"“噢，桑迪，你终于来了——我多想你呀！坐在我身边——不要离开我——不要再离开我了，桑迪，永远不要。你的手在哪儿呢？——把它给我，亲爱的，让我握住它——放那儿——现在一切都好了，都平安了，我也又开心了——我们又快活了，不是吗，桑迪？你看起来那么飘渺，那么模糊，就像是一团雾，一朵云，可是你在这儿呢，有这份福气就足够了；我还握着你的手，不要拿走——就一小会儿，我不会握太久的……孩子在哪儿？……总机！……她怎么不回答。或许是在睡觉吧？她醒了就把她带过来吧，让我摸摸她的小手，她的小脸，她的头发，跟她说声再见……桑迪！不错，你还在这儿呢。我刚才失去了意识，以为你走了呢……我病了很长时间了吗？一定是这样，我感觉有好几个月了。还有那些梦！那是些怎样奇怪而可怕的梦呀，桑迪！那些梦就跟真的一样——当然都是发昏，不过那么真实！唉，我以为国王死掉了，以为你在高卢，回不了家了，我以为这儿发生了革命；在这些异想天开狂乱激动的梦里，我梦见我和克拉伦斯还有几个军校学生跟全英国的骑士开战，把他们都消灭了！不过这还不算是最奇怪的。我似乎是来自一个遥远的时代，未来的时代，好几百年之后的时代，就连这个也和其他事情一样真实！不错，我似乎从那个时代飞回了咱们这个时代，然后又飞过去了，孤身一人降临到了那个奇怪的英国，谁也不认识，在你我之间横亘着一千三百年的深渊！在我和我的家，和我的朋友之间！在我和我所珍爱的一切之间，和所有让我不虚此生的一切之间！真是太可怕了——你都想象不到有多可怕，桑迪。啊，守在我身边，桑迪——守着我，片刻不离——不要让我再失去神智；死算不了什么，就让它来好了，可是不要那些梦，不要那些可怕的梦再来折磨我——我实在受不了……桑迪？……”","“Oh, Sandy, you are come at last—how I have longed for you!Sit by me—do not leave me—never leave me again, Sandy, never again.Where is your hand?—give it me, dear, let me hold it—there—now all is well, all is peace, and I am happy again—WE are happy again, isn’t it so, Sandy?You are so dim, so vague, you are but a mist, a cloud, but you are HERE, and that is blessedness sufficient; and I have your hand; don’t take it away—it is for only a little while, I shall not require it long....Was that the child?....Hello-Central!......she doesn’t answer.Asleep, perhaps?Bring her when she wakes, and let me touch her hands, her face, her hair, and tell her good-bye....Sandy! 　Yes, you are there.I lost myself a moment, and I thought you were gone....Have I been sick long?It must be so; it seems months to me.And such dreams!Such strange and awful dreams, Sandy!Dreams that were as real as reality—delirium, of course, but SO real!Why, I thought the king was dead, I thought you were in Gaul and couldn’t get home, I thought there was a revolution; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams, I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of England!But even that was not the strangest.I seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age, centuries hence, and even THAT was as real as the rest!Yes, I seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours, and then forward to it again, and was set down, a stranger and forlorn in that strange England, with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you! between me and my home and my friends! between me and all that is dear to me, all that could make life worth the living!It was awful—awfuler than you can ever imagine, Sandy.Ah, watch by me, Sandy—stay by me every moment—DON’T let me go out of my mind again; death is nothing, let it come, but not with those dreams, not with the torture of those hideous dreams—I cannot endure THAT again....Sandy?....”"
"他躺在那儿，前言不搭后语地嘟囔了一会儿；随后有那么一会儿他躺在那里不言语了，看得出他正一步步朝死亡走去。过了不久他的手指开始在床单上乱抓一气，看这个我就知道他快走向生命终点了，喉咙里也像人快死时那样发出咯咯的响声，他像受了点什么惊吓似的，撑起身来好像要听见点什么，随后他说道：","He lay muttering incoherently some little time; then for a time he lay silent, and apparently sinking away toward death.Presently his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet, and by that sign I knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the death-rattle in his throat he started up slightly, and seemed to listen: then he said:"
"“号角声？是国王！放下吊桥，快！人都到城垛上去！——放出来——”","“A bugle?....It is the king!The drawbridge, there!Man the battlements!—turn out the—”"
"他这是在准备他最后的“效果”，可是他永远也完成不了了。","He was getting up his last “effect”; but he never finished it."
