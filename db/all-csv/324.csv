"那一整天酷热难耐。","All that day the heat was terrible."
"风压着地面，紧贴着生草丛，沿着道路呼呼地刮着。扬起的白色粉尘打着转地打到我们脸上，纷纷扬扬地落了我们一身，仿佛皮肤生长时那种干燥瘙痒的感觉。几匹马跌跌撞撞，边走边喘。那匹驮马病怏怏的，肚子下擦伤了一大块，还裂着口子。那母马时不时地突然停下来，回头望着我们，像是要哭一样，发出一声长嘶。成百上千只云雀聒噪地叫着；天空呈现出板岩般的暗蓝灰色，云雀的叫声让我想起石笔刮过石板发出的刺耳之声。放眼望去，只看到一浪接一浪的生草丛，其间夹杂着紫色的兰花和挂着厚厚蛛网的麦卢卡树丛。","The wind blew close to the ground; it rooted among the tussock grass, slithered along the road, so that the white pumice dust swirled in our faces, settled and sifted over us and was like a dry-skin itching for growth on our bodies.The horses stumbled along, coughing and chuffing.The pack horse was sick—with a big, open sore rubbed under the belly.Now and again she stopped short, threw back her head, looked at us as though she were going to cry, and whinnied.Hundreds of larks shrilled; the sky was slate colour, and the sound of the larks reminded me of slate pencils scraping over its surface.There was nothing to be seen but wave after wave of tussock grass, patched with purple orchids and manuka bushes covered with thick spider webs."
"乔在前面骑着马。他穿着蓝色条纹棉布衬衫，灯芯绒裤子和一双马靴。一条白底红点的方巾——那红色的圆点看起来就像是他的鼻血滴到上面了似的——系在他的脖子上。几缕白色头发从他的宽檐帽下散落出来——胡子和眉毛也近乎白色——他没精打采地坐在马鞍上，嘴里嘟囔着什么。那天他一次也没唱起过那句：","Jo rode ahead.He wore a blue galatea shirt, corduroy trousers and riding boots.A white handkerchief, spotted with red—it looked as though his nose had been bleeding on it—was knotted round his throat.Wisps of white hair straggled from under his wideawake—his moustache and eyebrows were called white—he slouched in the saddle, grunting.Not once that day had he sung:"
"“我不在乎，难道你没看见，","“I don’t care, for don’t you see,"
"我的丈母娘就在我前面！”","My wife’s mother was in front of me!”"
"这可是一个月以来我们第一天没听到这首歌。此时此刻，他安静中带了些许神秘。吉姆骑着马和我并排而行，浑身白乎乎的像个小丑；他的黑眼睛闪耀着光芒，还不停地伸出舌头舔润嘴唇。他穿着一件纯毛背心，一条蓝色帆布裤子，腰上系着一根带褶的皮带。从天亮开始我们就没怎么说过话。中午我们在布满沼泽的小河边吃了午餐，吃的是夹心饼干和杏子。","It was the first day we had been without it for a month, and now there seemed something uncanny in his silence.Jim rode beside me, white as a clown; his black eyes glittered, and he kept shooting out his tongue and moistening his lips.He was dressed in a Jaeger vest, and a pair of blue duck trousers, fastened round the waist with a plaited leather belt.We had hardly spoken since dawn.At noon we had lunched off fly biscuits and apricots by the side of a swampy creek."
"“我的胃感觉像鸡嗉子一样。”乔说。“喂，吉姆，你在我们几个里算聪明的——你一直念叨的那个店在哪里呢？你总说：‘啊，是啊，我知道一个不错的店铺，有个放马的围场，一条小溪从它中间流过，店主是我的一个朋友，这人还没握手就会先送你一瓶威士忌。’我想去那个地方看看——仅仅是出于好奇心——并不是怀疑你说的话——这点你是再清楚不过了——可是……”","“My stomach feels like the crop of a hen,” said Jo.“Now then, Jim, you’re the bright boy of the party—where’s this ’ere store you kep’ on talking about.‘Oh, yes,’ you says, ‘I know a fine store, with a paddock for the horses and a creek runnin’ through, owned by a friend of mine who’ll give yer a bottle of whisky before ‘e shakes hands with yer.’I’d like ter see that place—merely as a matter of curiosity—not that I’d ever doubt yer word—as yer know very well—but...”"
"吉姆笑了。“你别忘了那儿还有个女人呢，乔，她有着蓝眼睛和黄头发，还没跟你握手就会答应你点什么。你仔细想想吧。”","Jim laughed.“Don’t forget there’s a woman too, Jo, with blue eyes and yellow hair, who’ll promise you something else before she shakes hands with you.Put that in your pipe and smoke it.”"
"“这天气热得快让人发疯。”乔说道。但他的膝盖仍牢牢地夹着马肚子。我们继续颠簸着前进。我快要睡着了，似乎还做了个不安的梦。梦里，马群一动也不动——突然我又坐在一个木马上，我的老母亲正在训斥我，说我玩木马把客厅地毯上的灰都搅起来了。我还听见她说：“你把地毯上的图案都给磨掉了。”并且感觉到她拽了一下我手中的缰绳。我啜泣着惊醒了，发现吉姆歪着身子，朝我坏坏地笑着。","“The heat’s making you balmy,” said Jo.But he dug his knees into the horse.We shambled on.I half fell asleep, and had a sort of uneasy dream that the horses were not moving forward at all—then that I was on a rocking-horse, and my old mother was scolding me for raising such a fearful dust from the drawing-room carpet.“You’ve entirely worn off the pattern of the carpet,” I heard her saying, and she gave the reins a tug.I snivelled and woke to find Jim leaning over me, maliciously smiling."
"“人人都会发生这种情况。可是，”他说，“我只是碰巧看到了你的而已。怎么了？梦到对谁依依不舍啦？”","“That was a case of all but,” said he.“I just caught you.What’sup?Been bye-bye?”"
"“才不是！”我扬起头。“感谢上帝，我们总算到了个有人烟的地方。”","“No!” I raised my head.“Thank the Lord we’re arriving somewhere.”"
"我们在山顶上，底下是一座房子，屋顶上铺着铁瓦楞。房子坐落在一个花园里，离大路很远——对面是个大围场，一条小溪从中穿过，溪边点缀着一丛丛小柳树。房顶上的烟囱里一缕淡淡的蓝烟笔直地向上飘出。正当我看着这一切，一个女人从屋子里走出来，身后跟着一个小孩和一条牧羊犬——女人手里拿着的好像是个黑棍子。她向我们做了个手势。","We were on the brow of the hill, and below us there was a whare roofed with corrugated iron.It stood in a garden, rather far back from the road—a big paddock opposite, and a creek and a clump of young willow trees.A thin line of blue smoke stood up straight from the chimney of the whare; and as I looked a woman came out, followed by a child and a sheep dog—the woman carrying what appeared to me a black stick.She made gestures at us."
"马奋力最后一冲，乔摘下宽檐帽，挺起胸膛呼喊，开始唱道：“我不在乎，难道你没看见……”太阳透过暗淡的云层，让一切景物染上一层明艳的光芒。阳光照耀着女人的黄头发，光芒挥洒在她那飘扬的围裙和来福枪上。孩子躲在她的身后，那只脏兮兮的黄狗也夹着尾巴匆忙地逃回了屋里。我们勒住缰绳下了马。","The horses put on a final spurt, Jo took off his wideawake, shouted, threw out his chest, and began singing, “I don’t care, for don’t you see...”The sun pushed through the pale clouds and shed a vivid light over the scene.It gleamed on the woman’s yellow hair, over her flapping pinafore and the rifle she was carrying.The child hid behind her, and the yellow dog, a mangy beast, scuttled back into the whare, his tail between his legs.We drew rein and dismounted."
"“喂，”女人尖声叫道，“我还以为你们是三只鹰呢。我孩子刚刚跑来告诉我。她说：‘妈妈，有三个褐色的东西正从山上过来。’跟你们说吧，我立马就跑了出来。‘肯定是鹰。’我跟她说。哦，你们或许不信，鹰老在这附近转悠。”","“Hallo,” screamed the woman.“I thought you was three’ awks.My kid comes runnin’ in ter me.‘Mumma,’ says she, ‘there’s three brown things comin’ over the ‘ill,’ says she.An’ I comes out smart, I can tell yer.‘They’ll be’ awks,’ I says to her.Oh, the’ awks about ’ere, yer wouldn’t believe.”"
"“孩子”在女人的围裙后打量了我们一眼——又把头缩了回去。","The “kid” gave us the benefit of one eye from behind the woman’s pinafore—then retired again."
"“你丈夫呢？”吉姆问。","“Where’s your old man?” asked Jim."
"女人飞快地眨了眨眼，皱着张脸。","The woman blinked rapidly, screwing up her face."
"“剪羊毛去了。走了都有一个月了。我想你们不会在此逗留，对吧？暴风雨快来了。”","“Away shearin’.Bin away a month.I suppose yer not goin’ to stop, are yer?There’s a storm comin’ up.”"
"“我们当然要留下来啰。”乔说，“太太，这么说你一个人很寂寞了吧？”","“You bet we are,” said Jo.“So you’re on your lonely, missus?”"
"她站在那儿，一边摆弄着围裙的褶边，一边像饥饿的大鸟般将我们每个人都扫视了一遍。我想起刚刚吉姆还拿这女人来逗乔，便笑了起来。没错，她倒是蓝眼睛、黄头发，却并不好看。她的形象实在是滑稽得很。你看看她，感觉围裙下面就只剩一副棍棒和电线做的骨头架子了——门牙掉光了，手又红又肿，脚上还套了双脏乎乎的半统靴。","She stood, pleating the frills of her pinafore, and glancing from one to the other of us, like a hungry bird.I smiled at the thought of how Jim had pulled Jo’s leg about her.Certainly her eyes were blue, and what hair she had was yellow, but ugly.She was a figure of fun.Looking at her, you felt there was nothing but sticks and wires under that pinafore—her front teeth were knocked out, she had red pulpy hands, and she wore on her feet a pair of dirty Bluchers."
"“我骑马转悠转悠去。”吉姆说。","“I’ll go and turn out the horses,” said Jim."
"“涂药了吗？波尔的擦伤太严重了！”","“Got any embrocation?Poi’s rubbed herself to hell!”"
"“等等！”女人沉默地站了一会儿，呼吸时鼻翼一张一阖。突然她咆哮起来。“我宁愿你们没停下……你们不能停留下来，没有任何商量的余地。我再不会把围场租出去了。你们走吧，我什么也没有！”","“Arf a mo!”The woman stood silent a moment, her nostrils expanding as she breathed.Then she shouted violently.“I’d rather you didn’t stop...You can’t, and there’s the end of it.I don’t let out that paddock any more.You’ll have to go on; I ain’t got nothing!”"
"“看看，我多走运！”乔加重语气说道。他把我拉到一旁。“离她远点。”他小声说，“她是太寂寞了，你知道的。”他别有深意地说道，“同情同情她，她会想通的。”","“Well, I’m blest!” said Jo, heavily.He pulled me aside.“Gone a bit off’er dot,” he whispered.“Too much alone, you know” very significantly.“Turn the sympathetic tap on’ er, she’ll come round all right.”"
"可是用不着了——她已经自己想明白了。","But there was no need—she had come round by herself."
"“想留下就留下吧！”她耸着肩膀嘟哝着。“你过来，我给你涂药。”她对我说道。","“Stop if yer like!” she muttered, shrugging her shoulders.To me—“I’ll give yer the embrocation if yer come along.”"
"“好嘞，我给他们拿药去。”我们一起走上花园小道。小道两侧都种着卷心菜。闻起来就像是馊了的洗碗水。还有一些双瓣罂粟花和石竹。有一小块地被帕瓦贝壳隔开——想必是那孩子的——因为她从母亲身边跑开，用破衣夹在上面刨起土来。那只黄狗横躺在门阶上，捉着虱子；女人用脚把它踢开。","“Right-o, I’ll take it down to them.”We walked together up the garden path.It was planted on both sides with cabbages.They smelled like stale dish-water.Of flowers there were double poppies and sweet-williams.One little patch was divided off by pawa shells—presumably it belonged to the child—for she ran from her mother and began to grub in it with a broken clothes-peg.The yellow dog lay across the doorstep, biting fleas; the woman kicked him away."
"“快滚开，你这畜生，这地方不干净。我今天没时间收拾——在熨衣服呢。进来。”","“Gar-r, get away, you beast the place ain’t tidy.I ‘aven’t ‘ad time ter fix things today—been ironing.Come right in.”"
"这是一个大房间，墙上贴满了废旧的英语杂志。维多利亚女王的《周年纪念刊》看起来要算最近一期的了。有一张桌子，上面放着熨衣板和盥洗盆，还有一些木板凳，一张黑色马毛沙发，靠墙有几把破藤椅。火炉上的壁炉台用粉色的纸包裹着，还用干草、蕨叶和理查德·塞登的水彩画点缀其中。里面有四扇门——一扇，从气味判断是通往“店铺”的，一扇通往“后院”，从第三扇可以看到卧室。苍蝇绕着天花板嗡嗡乱叫，粘蝇糖浆纸和几束干苜蓿被别在窗帘上。","It was a large room, the walls plastered with old pages of English periodicals.Queen Victoria’s Jubilee appeared to be the most recent number.A table with an ironing board and wash tub on it, some wooden forms, a black horsehair sofa, and some broken cane chairs pushed against the walls.The mantelpiece above the stove was draped in pink paper, further ornamented with dried grasses and ferns and a coloured print of Richard Seddon.There were four doors—one, judging from the smell, let into the “Store,” one on to the “backyard,” through a third I saw the bedroom.Flies buzzed in circles round the ceiling, and treacle papers and bundles of dried clover were pinned to the window curtains."
"我一个人在房间里；她去店铺里拿涂擦药了。我听见她走来走去，嘴里咕哝着：“明明有啊，我把瓶子放哪儿去了？”“在泡菜后面，不，不在那儿。”我在桌子上腾出个地方坐下来，摇晃着双腿。我听到乔在围场下面唱歌，还有吉姆用锤子捶打帐篷桩的声音。太阳下山了。在我们新西兰，是没有黄昏的，但有那么令人称奇的半小时——一切看起来光怪陆离——就像是乡下的孤魂野鬼到处游荡，看到什么都要冷笑一番。我一个人坐在阴暗的房子里，有点害怕。女人在隔壁屋里找东西找了好久。她在那里干嘛呀？一次我好像听见她用手猛拍柜台，还有一次哼了几声，又咳了起来，清清嗓子。我想大喊一句“快点！”但我什么也没说。","I was alone in the room; she had gone into the store for the embrocation.I heard her stamping about and muttering to herself: “I got some, now where did I put that bottle?It’s behind the pickles no, it ain’t.”I cleared a place on the table and sat there, swinging my legs.Down in the paddock I could hear Jo singing and the sound of hammer strokes as Jim drove in the tent pegs.It was sunset.There is no twilight in our New Zealand days, but a curious half-hour when everything appears grotesque—it frightens—as though the savage spirit of the country walked abroad and sneered at what it saw.Sitting alone in the hideous room I grew afraid.The woman next door was a long time finding that stuff.What was she doing in there?Once I thought I heard her bang her hands down on the counter, and once she half moaned, turning it into a cough and clearing her throat.I wanted to shout “Buck up!” but I kept silent."
"“天啊，这算什么生活！”我想。“在这种地方一天天过下去，还带着一个像小老鼠一样的孩子和一条脏兮兮的狗，简直让人难以想象。还要不停地熨衣服。疯了，她一定是疯了！我想知道她在这儿呆了多长时间——还想知道能不能跟她谈谈。”","“Good Lord, what a life!” I thought.“Imagine being here day in, day out, with that rat of a child and a mangy dog.Imagine bothering about ironing.Mad, of course she’s mad!Wonder how long she’s been here—wonder if I could get her to talk.”"
"这时她从门里探出头来。","At that moment she poked her head round the door."
"“你要的是什么呀？”她问道。","“Wot was it yer wanted?” she asked."
"“涂擦药。”","“Embrocation.”"
"“哦，我给忘了。找到了，在泡菜缸前面。”","“Oh, I forgot.I got it, it was in front of the pickle jars.”"
"她递给我瓶子。","She handed me the bottle."
"“嘿，你们看起来很累，确实累了！我弄点烤饼，做晚饭吧！店铺里还有点猪舌，如果你们喜欢的话，我还可以给你们做道卷心菜。”","“My, you do look tired, you do!Shall I knock yer up a few scones for supper!There’s some tongue in the store, too, and I’ll cook yer a cabbage if you fancy it.”"
"“好啊。”我对她笑了笑，“到我们围场那里喝茶吧，把孩子也带去。”","“Right-o.” I smiled at her.“Come down to the paddock and bring the kid for tea.”"
"她撅着嘴，摇了摇头。","She shook her head, pursing up her mouth."
"“哦，算了吧。我不想喝。我会让孩子把食物和一罐牛奶送过去。要不我多做一些烤饼，你们明天带着路上吃吧？”","“Oh no.I don’t fancy it.I’ll send the kid down with the things and a billy of milk.Shall I knock up a few extry scones to take with yer ter-morrow?”"
"“谢谢了。”","“Thanks.”"
"她走到门口站着。","She came and stood by the door."
"“这孩子几岁了？”","“How old is the kid?”"
"“六岁了——到明年圣诞节的时候。她总有这样那样的麻烦。出生一个月，我还没有奶给她吃，她病得像头牛。”","“Six—come next Christmas.I’ad a bit of trouble with ‘er one way an’ another.I ‘adn’t any milk till a month after she was born and she sickened like a cow.”"
"“她不太像你———像她父亲吗？”","“She’s not like you—takes after her father?”"
"接着女人就向我大声吼叫，就像刚才她拒绝我们一样。","Just as the woman had shouted her refusal at us before, she shouted at me then."
"“不，不像！她跟我一模一样。傻子都看得出来。进来，埃尔丝，不要弄得一身泥了。”","“No, she don’t!She’s the dead spit of me.Any fool could see that.Come on in now, Else, you stop messing in the dirt.”"
"我碰见乔翻过围墙的栅栏。","I met Jo climbing over the paddock fence."
"“那个老娘儿们的铺子里都有什么呀？”他问道。","“What’s the old bitch got in the store?” he asked."
"“不知道——没看。”","“Don’t know—didn’t look.”"
"“哎，都是废物。吉姆在骂你呢。这么长时间你都在干嘛呀？”","“Well, of all the fools.Jim’s slanging you.What have you been doing all the time?”"
"“她找不到药。噢，就你聪明！”","“She couldn’t find this stuff.Oh, my shakes, you are smart!”"
"乔洗完头，将湿发顺着前额一线梳好，在衬衫外穿了件外套，还扣好了扣子。他咧开嘴笑了。","Jo had washed, combed his wet hair in a line across his forehead, and buttoned a coat over his shirt.He grinned."
"吉姆从我手中抢过涂擦药。我走到围场尽头的柳树丛那儿，在小溪中洗澡。溪水清澈见底，丝软如油。河岸被草丛覆盖，上面飘着一层肥皂泡。我躺在水中，向上看着柳树，它们一会儿稳稳不动，不久又微微颤动，而后又恢复静止。空气中能闻到快下雨的味道。回到帐篷后，我才想起那女人和孩子。吉姆躺在火旁，看着牛奶煮着。","Jim snatched the embrocation from me.I went to the end of the paddock where the willows grew and bathed in the creek.The water was clear and soft as oil.Along the edges held by the grass and rushes, white foam tumbled and bubbled.I lay in the water and looked up at the trees that were still a moment, then quivered lightly, and again were still.The air smelt of rain.I forgot about the woman and the kid until I came back to the tent.Jim lay by the fire, watching the billy boil."
"我问他乔在哪里，还有那个小孩有没有给我们送来晚餐。","I asked where Jo was, and if the kid had brought our supper."
"“呸，”吉姆说着，翻过身望着天空，“你没看到乔在怎么梳妆打扮吗？他去那房子之前对我说道：‘该死的！在夜光下她会好看些——不管怎么说，宝贝，她很肉感。’”","“Pooh,” said Jim, rolling over and looking up at the sky.“Didn’t you see how Jo had been titivating?He said to me before he went up to the whare, ‘Dang it!she’ll look better by night light—at any rate, my buck, she’s female flesh!’”"
"“关于她的长相，你欺骗了乔——你把我也骗了。”","“You had Jo about her looks—you had me, too.”"
"“才不是的——听我说。我不明白。四年前我经过这里，在这里停留了两天。她丈夫曾在西岸当过矿工——是一个大个子，人很好，说话声音如号角般洪亮。她在岸边当过酒吧招待员——像个蜡娃娃一样漂亮。铁路通到纳皮尔以前，马车两周过来一次，那时她终日寻欢作乐。有次她偷偷告诉我她懂得一百二十五种不同的接吻方式！”","“No—look here.I can’t make it out.It’s four years since I came past this way, and I stopped here two days.The husband was a pal of mine once, down the West Coast—a fine, big chap, with a voice on him like a trombone.She’d been barmaid down the Coast—as pretty as a wax doll.The coach used to come this way then once a fortnight, that was before they opened the railway up Napier way, and she had no end of a time!Told me once in a confidential moment that she knew one hundred and twenty-five different ways of kissing!”"
"“哦，吉姆，说下去！她和以前不一样了！”","“Oh, go on, Jim!She isn’t the same woman!”"
"“她当然没变，只是我不太明白。我觉得可能是她丈夫走了，把她丢在这里：我对剪羊毛就是这么看的。甜蜜的生活！现在经过这里的只有毛利人和行脚客了！”","“Course she is I can’t make it out.What I think is the old man’s cleared out and left her: that’s all my eye about shearing.Sweet life!The only people who come through now are Maoris and sundowners!”"
"夜色中我们看到孩子的围裙闪亮。她缓慢走到我们身边，一手提着篮子，一手拿着奶罐。我把篮子里的东西拿出来，孩子在一旁站着。","Through the dark we saw the gleam of the kid’s pinafore.She trailed over to us with a basket in her hand, the milk billy in the other.I unpacked the basket, the child standing by."
"“到这边来。”吉姆打了个响指招呼她。","“Come over here,” said Jim, snapping his fingers at her."
"她走了过来，帐篷里射出来的灯光照亮了她的脸。一个瘦弱的小鬼，头发发白，双眼无神。她挺着肚子，两脚叉开站着。","She went, the lamp from the inside of the tent cast a bright light over her.A mean, undersized brat, with whitish hair, and weak eyes.She stood, legs wide apart and her stomach protruding."
"“你一整天都做些什么？”吉姆问她。","“What do you do all day?” asked Jim."
"她用小小的手指擦掉一滴泪水，看了看，说道：“画画。”","She scraped out one tear with her little finger, looked at the result and said, “Draw.”"
"“嗬！你画些什么啊？别抠耳朵了！”","“Huh! What do you draw?Leave your ears alone!”"
"“画图。”","“Pictures.”"
"“拿什么画啊？”","“What on?”"
"“用我妈妈的铅笔画在小片包黄油的纸上。”","“Bits of butter paper an’ a pencil of my Mumma’s.”"
"“罢了！一次说这么多话！”吉姆转眼看着她,“画的小羊小牛？”","“Boh!What a lot of words at one time!” Jim rolled his eyes at her.“Baa-lambs and moo-cows?”"
"“不是，我什么都画。你们走后，我会把你们都画下来，你们的马，帐篷，还有那个”——她对我指着——“光着身子在小溪里洗澡的人。我在她看不到我的地方注视她。”","“No, everything.I’ll draw all of you when you’re gone, and your horses and the tent, and that one”—she pointed to me—“with no clothes on in the creek.I looked at her where she couldn’t see me from.”"
"“很谢谢你。你真是机灵。”吉姆说道，“你爸爸在哪里？”","“Thanks very much.How ripping of you,” said Jim.“Where’s Dad?”"
"那孩子撅起嘴巴。“我不会告诉你，因为我不喜欢你这张脸！”她又开始抠另一只耳朵。","The kid pouted.“I won’t tell you because I don’t like yer face!”She started operations on the other ear."
"“过来。”我说，“拿着篮子回家，告诉另一个人晚饭准备好了。”","“Here,” I said.“Take the basket, get along home and tell the other man supper’s ready.”"
"“我不想去。”","“I don’t want to.”"
"“你要是不去的话我会揍你的。”吉姆蛮横地说道。","“I’ll give you a box on the ear if you don’t,” said Jim, savagely."
"“哼！我要去告诉妈妈。我要去告诉妈妈。那孩子跑走了。","“Hie! I’ll tell Mumma. I’ll tell Mumma.”The kid fled."
"我们吃饱后，开始抽烟了乔才回来。他手里拿着瓶威士忌，洋洋得意的样子。","We ate until we were full, and had arrived at the smoke stage before Jo came back, very flushed and jaunty, a whisky bottle in his hand."
"“喝一杯吧，你们俩！”他喊着，并喝令我们：“呃，把杯子推过来。”","“‘Ave a drink—you two!” he shouted, carrying off matters with a high hand.“‘Ere, shove along the cups.”"
"“一百二十五种方式。”我小声对吉姆说。","“One hundred and twenty-five different ways,” I murmured to Jim."
"“什么呀？哦！收起那套吧！”乔说。","“What’s that? Oh! stow it!” said Jo."
"“你干嘛老跟我过不去。你这家伙跟主日学校吃大餐的孩子一样。她想要我们今晚到上面去，好好聊聊。“我”——他轻轻挥手——“我把她收服了。”","“Why ‘ave you always got your knife into me.You gas like a kid at a Sunday School beano.She wants us to go up there to-night, and have a comfortable chat.“I”—he waved his hand airily—“I got ‘er round.”"
"“信你一次，”吉姆笑着说，“但是她没告诉你她丈夫去哪里了吗？”","“Trust you for that,” laughed Jim.“But did she tell you where the old man’s got to?”"
"乔抬起头。“剪羊毛去了啊！你也听到她说了啊，傻瓜！”","Jo looked up.“Shearing!You ‘eard ‘er, you fool!”"
"女人把屋子收好了，还在桌子上摆了束淡雅的石竹。我和她坐在桌子一边，乔和吉姆在另一边。我们中间放了盏油灯、威士忌酒瓶、酒杯和一壶水。孩子跪靠着长凳，在包黄油的纸上画画；我挺担心她是不是在画河边洗澡的那幅。然而乔所说的关于夜晚时分的话倒是真的。女人的头发凌乱——两颊绯红——双眼明亮——我们明白他俩的脚正在桌子底下接着吻呢。她脱下了蓝色围裙，换了白棉布夹克和黑裙子——孩子的头发上别了个蓝色的棉缎蝴蝶结，算是打扮了一下。屋子很闷，苍蝇在天花板上嗡嗡乱窜，有的还掉到了桌子上，我们都有些醉了。","The woman had fixed up the room, even to a light bouquet of sweet-williams on the table.She and I sat one side of the table, Jo and Jim the other.An oil lamp was set between us, the whisky bottle and glasses, and a jug of water.The kid knelt against one of the forms, drawing on butter paper; I wondered, grimly, if she was attempting the creek episode.But Jo had been right about night time.The woman’s hair was tumbled—two red spots burned in her cheeks—her eyes shone—and we knew that they were kissing feet under the table.She had changed the blue pinafore for a white calico dressing jacket and a black skirt—the kid was decorated to the extent of a blue sateen hair ribbon.In the stifling room, with the flies buzzing against the ceiling and dropping on to the table, we got slowly drunk."
"“现在听我说，”女人大叫道，在桌子上重重地锤了一下。“我结婚六年，流产了四次。我跟他说，我说，你觉得我在这儿干的什么事儿啊？要是你回到海岸老家，我一定叫人给你定一个谋害孩子的罪名。我一遍遍地告诉他——你摧残了我的意志，毁了我的容貌，图的是什么——我就图这个。”她双手挠了挠头，把我们挨个看了一遍。她急声说道：“哦，有些日子了——好几个月了——那几个字总是浮现在我的脑海中——图什么！”但有时候我煮土豆，揭开锅盖搅拌几下，就会突然听见，‘图什么！’哦！我不是只图土豆和孩子——我是说——我是说，”她打了个嗝——“你懂我的意思，乔先生。”","“Now listen to me,” shouted the woman, banging her fist on the table.“It’s six years since I was married, and four miscarriages.I says to ’im, I says, what do you think I’m doin’ up ’ere?If you was back at the coast, I’d ‘ave you lynched for child murder.Over and over I tells ’im—you’ve broken my spirit and spoiled my looks, and wot for—that’s wot I’m driving at.”She clutched her head with her hands and stared round at us.Speaking rapidly, “Oh, some days—an’ months of them—I ‘ear them two words knockin’ inside me all the time—‘Wot for!’ but sometimes I’ll be cooking the spuds an’ I lifts the lid off to give ’em a prong and I ‘ears, quite suddin again, ‘Wot for!’Oh! I don’t mean only the spuds and the kid—I mean—I mean,” she hiccoughed—“you know what I mean, Mr. Jo.”"
"“我懂。”乔说，一面挠了挠头。","“I know,” said Jo, scratching his head."
"“问题是，”她趴在桌子上，“他让我一个人孤独太久了。车不过来的时候，他有时连着几天不回家，有时好几个星期不回家，留我一个人在这里照看店铺。偶尔回来一趟——高兴得不得了。‘哦，你好。’他说，‘这几天过得怎样？过来亲一个。’有时我脾气不大好，他又走了，但是要是我装作一副若无其事的样子，他就会多呆几天，直到我对他言听计从，他便会说，‘好了，再见，我要走了。’你说我还能留着他吗？我不能！”","“Trouble with me is,” she leaned across the table, “he left me too much alone.When the coach stopped coming, sometimes he’d go away days, sometimes he’d go away weeks, and leave me ter look after the store.Back ‘e’d come—pleased as Punch.‘Oh, ‘allo, ‘e’d say.‘Ow are you gettin’ on.Come and give us a kiss.’Sometimes I’d turn a bit nasty, and then ‘e’d go off again, and if I took it all right, ‘e’d wait till ‘e could twist me round ‘is finger, then ‘e’d say, ‘Well, so long, I’m off,’ and do you think I could keep ’im?—not me!”"
"“妈妈，”孩子叫道，“我画了幅画，他们在山上，我和你，还有小狗在下面。”","“Mumma,” bleated the kid, “I made a picture of them on the ‘ill, an’ you an’ me, an’ the dog down below.”"
"“闭嘴！”女人说。","“Shut your mouth!” said the woman."
"一束亮光在房间里闪过——我们听见了轰轰的雷声。","A vivid flash of lightning played over the room—we heard the mutter of thunder."
"“好在下了点雨啊，”乔说，“我盼了三天了。”","“Good thing that’s broke loose,” said Jo.“I’ve ‘ad it in me ‘ead for three days.”"
"“你的丈夫现在在哪儿啊？”吉姆不紧不慢地问道。","“Where’s your old man now?” asked Jim, slowly."
"女人哇哇大哭起来，一头倒在桌子上。“吉姆，他去剪羊毛了又剩下我独自一人。”她哭诉着。","The woman blubbered and dropped her head on to the table.“Jim, ‘e’s gone shearin’ and left me alone again,” she wailed."
"“呃，小心玻璃杯。”乔说，“高兴点吧，再喝点。丈夫走了哭也没用！吉姆，都怪你！”","“‘Ere, look out for the glasses,” said Jo.“Cheer-o, ‘ave another drop.No good cryin’ over spilt ‘usbands!You Jim, you blasted cuckoo!”"
"“乔先生，”女人说着，一面用衣角擦干了眼泪，“你是个绅士，如果我是个从事秘密工作的女人，我也会一股脑告诉你我所有的秘密。我不介意为此干上一杯。”","“Mr. Jo,” said the woman, drying her eyes on her jacket frill, “you’re a gent, an’ if I was a secret woman, I’d place any confidence in your ‘ands.I don’t mind if I do ‘ave a glass on that.”"
"闪电光线渐强，雷声不断逼近。吉姆和我沉默了——小孩一直坐在板凳上，没有离开过。她吐出舌头，对着她的画吹了吹。","Every moment the lightning grew more vivid and the thunder sounded nearer.Jim and I were silent—the kid never moved from her bench.She poked her tongue out and blew on her paper as she drew."
"“好寂寞，”女人对乔说道——他含情脉脉地看着她——“像只抱窝的母鸡被困在这里。”他隔着桌子伸出手去拉着她的手，尽管这个姿势对于递水递酒不方便，但他俩的手紧紧黏在一起，像涂了胶水似的。我推开椅子走到孩子跟前，她一屁股坐在那些杰作上，还朝我做了个鬼脸。","“It’s the loneliness,” said the woman, addressing Jo—he made sheep’s eyes at her—“and bein’ shut up ’ere like a broody ‘en.”He reached his hand across the table and held hers, and though the position looked most uncomfortable when they wanted to pass the water and whisky, their hands stuck together as though glued.I pushed back my chair and went over to the kid, who immediately sat flat down on her artistic achievements and made a face at me."
"“不给你看。”她说。","“You’re not to look,” said she."
"“噢，来吧，别这么坏！”吉姆朝我们走来，我们带着几分醉意哄着孩子给我们看了一眼。她的画非同一般，庸俗至极。完全是凭着一个疯子的聪明才智画出来的疯狂画作。毋庸置疑，这孩子的头脑不正常。当她把画给我们看的时候，她几乎沉浸在狂喜之中，笑声不断，还不住地颤抖，展开双臂。","“Oh, come on, don’t be nasty!”Jim came over to us, and we were just drunk enough to wheedle the kid into showing us.And those drawings of hers were extraordinary and repulsively vulgar.The creations of a lunatic with a lunatic’s cleverness.There was no doubt about it, the kid’s mind was diseased.While she showed them to us, she worked herself up into a mad excitement, laughing and trembling, and shooting out her arms."
"“妈妈，”她扯着嗓子叫道，“我要给他们画那些你以前不让我画的——现在我可以画了。”","“Mumma,” she yelled.“Now I’m going to draw them what you told me I never was to—now I am.”"
"女人从桌旁冲过去，在孩子的头上狠狠地拍了一巴掌。","The woman rushed from the table and beat the child’s head with the flat of her hand."
"“你要是再敢这样说，我就掀起你的衣服揍你。”她咆哮起来。","“I’ll smack you with yer clothes turned up if yer dare say that again,” she bawled."
"乔喝醉了没有注意到，可吉姆拉住了她的胳膊。孩子没哭一声。她跑到窗边，在粘蝇纸上捡苍蝇去了。","Jo was too drunk to notice, but Jim caught her by the arm.The kid did not utter a cry.She drifted over to the window and began picking flies from the treacle paper."
"我们回到桌边——吉姆和我坐在一边，女人和乔肩并着肩坐在另一边。我们听着雷声，随口乱说道：“这声很近，”“又来了一声。”乔在一声响雷之后说：“现在我们出发了，”“刹车了，坐稳了。”后来真下了雨，雨点像炮弹打在铁皮屋顶上。","We returned to the table—Jim and I sitting one side, the woman and Jo, touching shoulders, the other.We listened to the thunder, saying stupidly, “That was a near one,” “There it goes again,” and Jo, at a heavy hit, “Now we’re off,” “Steady on the brake,” until rain began to fall, sharp as cannon shot on the iron roof."
"“你们暂住一宿吧。”女人说。","“You’d better doss here for the night,” said the woman."
"“好的。”乔附和说，很明显他知道女人会这样说。","“That’s right,” assented Jo, evidently in the know about this move."
"“把帐篷里的东西拿过来。”你们二人可以和孩子呆在店里——她常常睡在那里，不会介意的。”","“Bring up yer things from the tent.You two can doss in the store along with the kid—she’s used to sleep in there and won’t mind you.”"
"“妈妈，我从没在那睡过。”孩子插嘴说。","“Oh Mumma, I never did,” interrupted the kid."
"“别说谎了！而且乔先生可以住在这里。”","“Shut yer lies!An’ Mr. Jo can ‘ave this room.”"
"这样安排有点荒唐，但拦了也没用，他们已经走远了。女人大致计划了一下，乔坐在一旁异常正经，满脸通红，双眼发肿，不停地捋着胡子。","It sounded a ridiculous arrangement, but it was useless to attempt to cross them, they were too far gone.While the woman sketched the plan of action, Jo sat, abnormally solemn and red, his eyes bulging, and pulling at his moustache."
"“拿个灯笼过来。”吉姆说，“我去围场转转。”我们俩一起去了。雨点打在我们脸上，地面发亮，像是大火蔓延开来。我们好似两个探险时走散的孩子，对着彼此大笑大叫，回到屋子时，发现孩子已经铺好被褥躺在店里柜台上了。","“Give us a lantern,” said Jim, “I’ll go down to the paddock.”We two went together.Rain whipped in our faces, the land was light as though a bush fire was raging.We behaved like two children let loose in the thick of an adventure, laughed and shouted to each other, and came back to the whare to find the kid already bedded in the counter of the store."
"女人给我们拿了盏灯。乔从吉姆那接过铺盖，关上了房门。","The woman brought us a lamp.Jo took his bundle from Jim, the door was shut."
"“大家晚安。”乔大声说。","“Good-night all,” shouted Jo."
"吉姆和我坐在两大袋土豆上。我们一直忍不住大笑。天花板上挂着一串串洋葱和半根火腿——不论我们看哪里，都有“速溶咖啡”和肉类罐头的广告。我们指着广告，试图大声朗读——希望止住大笑，不再打嗝。柜台上的孩子瞪了我们一会。她掀开毯子，爬到地板上，穿着灰色法兰绒睡衣站着，两条腿相互磨蹭着。我们没理她。","Jim and I sat on two sacks of potatoes.For the life of us we could not stop laughing.Strings of onions and half-hams dangled from the ceiling—wherever we looked there were advertisements for “Camp Coffee” and tinned meats.We pointed at them, tried to read them aloud—overcome with laughter and hiccoughs.The kid in the counter stared at us.She threw off her blanket and scrambled to the floor, where she stood in her grey flannel night-gown, rubbing one leg against the other.We paid no attention to her."
"“你们在笑什么？”她不安地问。","“Wot are you laughing at?” she said, uneasily."
"“笑你啊！”吉姆大叫，“你们红种人，我的孩子。”","“You!” shouted Jim.“The red tribe of you, my child.”"
"她勃然大怒，用手打自己。“不许你们笑我，你们这些坏蛋——你们。”他向下一扑，压到孩子身上，把她推到了柜台上。","She flew into a rage and beat herself with her hands.“I won’t be laughed at, you curs—you.”He swooped down upon the child and swung her on to the counter."
"“快去睡觉吧，俊小姐——要不画画——这有铅笔——你可以用你妈妈的账本画。”","“Go to sleep, Miss Smarty—or make a drawing—here’s a pencil—you can use Mumma’s account book.”"
"透过雨声，我们听到了乔在隔壁的响声——门开了——又关了。","Through the rain we heard Jo creak over the boarding of the next room—the sound of a door being opened—then shut to."
"“太寂寞了。”吉姆轻声说道。","“It’s the loneliness,” whispered Jim."
"“一百二十五种花样——哎！我可怜的弟兄！”","“One hundred and twenty-five different ways—alas! my poor brother!”"
"孩子撕了一页纸扔向我。","The kid tore out a page and flung it at me."
"“给你。”她说，“我想气气我妈妈，因为她把我关在这里跟你们两个睡。我只是画了她从不让我画的画。她说要是我画了就会揍我，可我还是画了。谁在乎啊！谁在乎！”","“There you are,” she said.“Now I done it ter spite Mumma for shutting me up ’ere with you two.I done the one she told me I never ought to.I done the one she told me she’d shoot me if I did.Don’t care!Don’t care!”"
"孩子画了幅画，一个女人用来福枪杀了一个男人，然后挖了个坑把他埋了。","The kid had drawn the picture of the woman shooting at a man with a rook rifle and then digging a hole to bury him in."
"她从柜台上跳下，一边啃着手指一边在地板上来回翻滚。","She jumped off the counter and squirmed about on the floor biting her nails."
"吉姆和我坐在画旁，直到天亮。雨停了，小孩也睡着了，重重地呼吸着。我们起身，偷偷溜出屋子，来到了围场。白云飘浮在粉色的天空——一阵凉风袭来，空气中弥漫着湿草的芳香。我们正要跨上马鞍，乔从屋子里走出来——他示意让我们先上路。","Jim and I sat till dawn with the drawing beside us.The rain ceased, the little kid fell asleep, breathing loudly.We got up, stole out of the whare, down into the paddock.White clouds floated over a pink sky—a chill wind blew; the air smelled of wet grass.Just as we swung into the saddle Jo came out of the whare—he motioned to us to ride on."
"“我一会就赶上你们。”他大声喊道。","“I’ll pick you up later,” he shouted."
"拐过了一个弯，整个屋子连影都不见了。","A bend in the road, and the whole place disappeared."
