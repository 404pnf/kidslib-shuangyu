"胆小鬼，内戈雷","Negore, the Coward"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"他顺着他奔逃族人的足迹走了十一天了，他的追赶本身就是一种逃跑；因为他清楚地知道在他身后是可怕的俄国人，他们正艰难地穿过沼泽低地，爬过陡峭的分水岭，铁定心要消灭他所有的族人。他轻装上路。一件兔皮睡袍、一杆前装式的步枪，和几磅晒干的鲑鱼构成了他的装备。如果不是知道有恐惧在驱使着他们，他可能会对所有人——女人、孩子和老人——能走得如此之快感到惊讶。","He had followed the trail of his fleeing people for eleven days, and his pursuit had been in itself a flight; for behind him he knew full well were the dreaded Russians, toiling through the swampy lowlands and over the steep divides, bent on no less than the extermination of all his people.He was travelling light.A rabbit-skin sleeping-robe, a muzzle-loading rifle, and a few pounds of sun-dried salmon constituted his outfit.He would have marvelled that a whole people—women and children and aged—could travel so swiftly, had he not known the terror that drove them on."
"这发生在从前俄国人占领阿拉斯加州的时候，当时十九世纪已经过半。内戈尔飞奔着追赶他逃跑的部落，在这个夏夜于皮莱特河上游碰到了他们。尽管已接近午夜时分，他穿过宿营的疲倦人群时，天还大亮着。很多人看到了他，所有人都认识他，但是很少有人跟他打招呼，即使有也是冷冷的问候。","It was in the old days of the Russian occupancy of Alaska, when the nineteenth century had run but half its course, that Negore fled after his fleeing tribe and came upon it this summer night by the head waters of the Pee-lat.Though near the midnight hour, it was bright day as he passed through the weary camp.Many saw him, all knew him, but few and cold were the greetings he received."
"“胆小鬼，内戈雷。”他听到伊利哈，一个年轻女人，笑了，还有他妹妹的女儿森妮，跟她一起笑了。","“Negore, the Coward,” he heard Illiha, a young woman, laugh, and Sun-ne, his sister’s daughter, laughed with her."
"极度的怒火啃噬着他的心，但他没有表现出来，从营火之间穿了过去，直到他来到一个老人坐着的地方。一个年轻女人正在用灵巧的手指揉捏他腿上疲劳的肌肉。内戈雷的脚踢到一根枯枝，劈啪作响，老人看不见，抬起头专心地听着。","Black anger ate at his heart; but he gave no sign, threading his way among the camp-fires until he came to one where sat an old man.A young woman was kneading with skilful fingers the tired muscles of his legs.He raised a sightless face and listened intently as Negore’s foot crackled a dead twig."
"“谁来了？”他问道，声音微弱颤抖。","“Who comes?” he queried in a thin, tremulous voice."
"“内戈雷。”年轻女人说道，几乎没停下手里的工作，抬头去看他。","“Negore,” said the young woman, scarcely looking up from her task."
"内戈雷面无表情。他站在那等了好长时间。老人的头又垂到了胸前。年轻女人压压戳戳萎缩的肌肉，把整个身体靠在膝盖上，低垂的头藏在了如云浓密的黑发里。内戈雷注视着这灵活的身躯，像猞猁一样能够弯到臀部，像小柳枝一样柔韧，此外，也像年轻人那样强壮。他看着，意识到一种极大的渴望，那感觉类似于生理上的饥饿。终于，他说话了：","Negore’s face was expressionless.For many minutes he stood and waited.The old man’s head had sunk back upon his chest.The young woman pressed and prodded the wasted muscles, resting her body on her knees, her bowed head hidden as in a cloud by her black wealth of hair.Negore watched the supple body, bending at the hips as a lynx’s body might bend, pliant as a young willow stalk, and, withal, strong as only youth is strong.He looked, and was aware of a great yearning, akin in sensation to physical hunger.At last he spoke, saying:"
"“没有人问候一下内戈雷吗？他离开了那么久，可是现在又回来了。”","“Is there no greeting for Negore, who has been long gone and has but now come back?”"
"她抬头冷冷地看看他。那个老人咯咯笑了起来，以一个老人的方式。","She looked up at him with cold eyes.The old man chuckled to himself after the manner of the old."
"“你是我的女人，乌纳。”内戈雷说，口气强硬，有点儿威胁的意味。","“Thou art my woman, Oona,” Negore said, his tones dominant and conveying a hint of menace."
"她像猫一样灵活、迅速地起身站直了，眼睛里闪着光，鼻孔像鹿的一样翕动着。","She arose with catlike ease and suddenness to her full height, her eyes flashing, her nostrils quivering like a deer’s."
"“我将是你的女人，内戈雷，但你是一个胆小鬼，老基努斯的女儿不会嫁给一个胆小鬼的！”","“I was thy woman to be, Negore, but thou art a coward; the daughter of Old Kinoos mates not with a coward!”"
"当他要开口争辩时，她用一个专横的手势让他住口了。","She silenced him with an imperious gesture as he strove to speak."
"“老基努斯和我从异地他乡来到你们中间。你的人民接纳了我们，用他们的火给我们取暖，既没问我们从何处来也没问我们为什么流浪。他们认为老基努斯由于年龄大了失明了；老基努斯没有否认，作为他女儿的我也没有。老基努斯是一个勇敢的人，但他从不是一个自夸的人。现在，我告诉你他是怎么失明的，毫无疑问,你就会知道，基努斯的女儿不会成为胆小鬼的孩子的母亲，像你——内戈雷——一样的胆小鬼。”","“Old Kinoos and I came among you from a strange land.Thy people took us in by their fires and made us warm, nor asked whence or why we wandered.It was their thought that Old Kinoos had lost the sight of his eyes from age; nor did Old Kinoos say otherwise, nor did I, his daughter.Old Kinoos is a brave man, but Old Kinoos was never a boaster.And now, when I tell thee of how his blindness came to be, thou wilt know, beyond question, that the daughter of Kinoos cannot mother the children of a coward such as thou art, Negore.”"
"她又一次压制了他冲到嘴边的话。","Again she silenced the speech that rushed up to his tongue."
"“看，内戈雷，即使把你在这片土地的所有旅行都加在一起，你也不会到达大盐海边陌生的锡特卡。那个地方有很多俄国人，他们的统治是严酷的。老基努斯那时还年轻，从锡特卡带着我——他怀里的婴儿——沿着海中央的岛屿逃跑了。由于他犯了错，母亲受到牵连被一个俄国人杀死了，为了给母亲报仇，他刺死了那个俄国人，长矛穿透了他的胸膛。”","“Know, Negore, if journey be added unto journey of all thy journeyings through this land, thou wouldst not come to the unknown Sitka on the Great Salt Sea.In that place there be many Russian folk, and their rule is harsh.And from Sitka, Old Kinoos, who was Young Kinoos in those days, fled away with me, a babe in his arms, along the islands in the midst of the sea.My mother dead tells the tale of his wrong; a Russian, dead with a spear through breast and back, tells the tale of the vengeance of Kinoos."
"“但无论我们逃到哪儿，逃得多远，我们总是能发现讨厌的俄国人。基努斯无所畏惧，但看到他们就是对他双眼的一个伤害；所以我们继续逃离，时光荏苒，我们越过一片片海洋，直到我们来到了大雾海，内戈雷，就是你听说过，但从来没看到过的那个地方。我们和很多人生活在一起，我长成为一个女人，但基努斯也渐渐变老了，他没有再娶任何其他女人，我也没有嫁给任何人。”","“But wherever we fled, and however far we fled, always did we find the hated Russian folk.Kinoos was unafraid, but the sight of them was a hurt to his eyes; so we fled on and on, through the seas and years, till we came to the Great Fog Sea, Negore, of which thou hast heard, but which thou hast never seen.We lived among many peoples, and I grew to be a woman; but Kinoos, growing old, took to him no other woman, nor did I take a man."
"“终于，我们来到了帕斯特利克，育空河在那里汇入大雾海。我们在这里的海边上住了很久，这里的人们都十分痛恨俄国人。但有时，这些俄国人会乘着大船到这儿，让帕斯特利克的人给他们带路，穿过河口众多的育空河上那些数不清的岛屿。有时被他们抓去带路的人一去不返，终于有一天，那里的人民愤怒了，制定了一个大计划。”","“At last we came to Pastolik, which is where the Yukon drowns itself in the Great Fog Sea.Here we lived long, on the rim of the sea, among a people by whom the Russians were well hated.But sometimes they came, these Russians, in great ships, and made the people of Pastolik show them the way through the islands uncountable of the many-mouthed Yukon.And sometimes the men they took to show them the way never came back, till the people became angry and planned a great plan."
"“所以，当有船来了，老基努斯就走上前说他要带路。那时他老了，头发也白了，但他无所畏惧。他很狡猾，因为他把船带到了海湾处，白色的海浪拍打着罗曼诺夫山。白浪拍打着将船卷入大海中，船撞在岩石上，船帮就破开了。然后帕斯特利克的所有人（计划就是如此）带着打仗用的长矛、弓箭和一些枪冲出来。但一开始，俄国人就挖了老基努斯的双眼，这样他就永远不能再带路了，然后他们在白浪拍打的地方，和帕斯特利克的人民并肩作战。”","“So, when there came a ship, Old Kinoos stepped forward and said he would show the way.He was an old man then, and his hair was white; but he was unafraid.And he was cunning, for he took the ship to where the sea sucks in to the land and the waves beat white on the mountain called Romanoff.The sea sucked the ship in to where the waves beat white, and it ground upon the rocks and broke open its sides.Then came all the people of Pastolik, (for this was the plan), with their war-spears, and arrows, and some few guns.But first the Russians put out the eyes of Old Kinoos that he might never show the way again, and then they fought, where the waves beat white, with the people of Pastolik."
"“现在这些俄国人的首领叫伊凡。就是他，用他的两个大拇指，挖去了基努斯的双眼。就是他，穿过激流杀出一条路，带着仅剩的两个人，沿着大雾海边逃到了北部。基努斯是英明的。他再也看不到了，像个孩子一样无助。所以他逃离大海，向陌生的大育空上游走，甚至到了鲁那托，我和他一起逃离。”","“Now the head-man of these Russians was Ivan.He it was, with his two thumbs, who drove out the eyes of Kinoos.He it was who fought his way through the white water, with two men left of all his men, and went away along the rim of the Great Fog Sea into the north.Kinoos was wise.He could see no more and was helpless as a child.So he fled away from the sea, up the great, strange Yukon, even to Nulato, and I fled with him."
"“这就是我父亲基努斯，一个老人的所为。但年轻人内戈雷是怎么做的？”","“This was the deed my father did, Kinoos, an old man.But how did the young man, Negore?”"
"她再一次没让他说话。","Once again she silenced him."
"“但是几天前，在鲁那托大堡垒的门前，我亲眼看到了。我看到那个俄国人伊凡，挖出我父亲眼睛的那个人，用他的狗鞭抽打你，就像在打一条狗。我看到了，知道了你就是一个胆小鬼。但那晚，当你所有的人民——是的，甚至还不是猎手的男孩们——袭击俄国人，并宰杀他们所有人的时候，我没有看到你。”","“With my own eyes I saw, at Nulato, before the gates of the great fort, and but few days gone.I saw the Russian, Ivan, who thrust out my father’s eyes, lay the lash of his dog-whip upon thee and beat thee like a dog.This I saw, and knew thee for a coward.But I saw thee not, that night, when all thy people—yea, even the boys not yet hunters—fell upon the Russians and slew them all.”"
"“不是伊凡，”内戈雷静静地说，“即使到现在，他还对我们紧追不舍，很多俄国人跟着他一起从海上冒出来。”","“Not Ivan,” said Negore, quietly.“Even now is he on our heels, and with him many Russians fresh up from the sea.”"
"伊凡没死，乌纳没有试图隐藏她对此的惊讶和懊恼，而是继续说：","Oona made no effort to hide her surprise and chagrin that Ivan was not dead, but went on:"
"“白天，我看到你是一个胆小鬼；晚上，当所有人在战斗，甚至还不是猎手的男孩们都在内，我没有看到你，我更加认为你是一个胆小鬼。”","“In the day I saw thee a coward; in the night, when all men fought, even the boys not yet hunters, I saw thee not and knew thee doubly a coward.”"
"“你说完了吗？都说完了？”内戈雷问道。","“Thou art done?All done?” Negore asked."
"她点点头，轻蔑地看着他，对他竟然还有话要说表示惊讶。","She nodded her head and looked at him askance, as though astonished that he should have aught to say."
"“要知道那个内戈雷不是胆小鬼。”他说，他的声音很低很轻，“要知道我还是一个孩子的时候，就独自旅行到育空河汇入大雾海的地方。我甚至到了帕斯特利克，甚至越过那里，沿着海边到了北部。还是孩子的时候，我就这样做过，所以我不是胆小鬼。我年轻时也不是一个胆小鬼，从育空河向上独自旅行，到达比人类曾经到过的地方还要远的地方，那么远以至于我到了另一个白皮肤的民族，居住在大堡垒里面，说着和俄国人不一样的话。我还杀死了塔纳纳河的一只大熊，我的人民没有一个人曾经到过那里。我还与遥远地区的努克鲁凯特人、卡尔塔格人和斯迪克人打过架，而且我是独自一人。没有人知道这些事情，我只能为自己辩护。让我的人民替我说那些他们知道的我做过的事情吧。他们不会说内戈雷是一个胆小鬼。”","“Know then that Negore is no coward,” he said; and his speech was very low and quiet.“Know that when I was yet a boy I journeyed alone down to the place where the Yukon drowns itself in the Great Fog Sea.Even to Pastolik I journeyed, and even beyond, into the north, along the rim of the sea.This I did when I was a boy, and I was no coward.Nor was I coward when I journeyed, a young man and alone, up the Yukon farther than man had ever been, so far that I came to another folk, with white faces, who live in a great fort and talk speech other than that the Russians talk.Also have I killed the great bear of the Tanana country, where no one of my people hath ever been.And I have fought with the Nuklukyets, and the Kaltags, and the Sticks in far regions, even I, and alone.These deeds, whereof no man knows, I speak for myself.Let my people speak for me of things I have done which they know.They will not say Negore is a coward.”"
"他自豪地说完了，自豪地等待着。","He finished proudly, and proudly waited."
"“这些是我来到这片土地之前发生的事情，”她说，“我不知道这些事。我只知道那些我知道的事情，我知道，白天我看到你像狗一样被人抽打；晚上，当大堡垒被烧得通红，人们相互厮杀时，我没看到你。而且，你的人民的确称呼你内戈雷为胆小鬼。现在这就是你的名字，内戈雷，胆小鬼。”","“These be things which happened before I came into the land,” she said, “and I know not of them.Only do I know what I know, and I know I saw thee lashed like a dog in the day; and in the night, when the great fort flamed red and the men killed and were killed, I saw thee not.Also, thy people do call thee Negore, the Coward.It is thy name now, Negore, the Coward.”"
"“这不是一个好名字。”老基努斯轻声笑了。","“It is not a good name,” Old Kinoos chuckled."
"“你不明白，基努斯，”内戈雷柔声说道,“但我会让你明白的。”要知道我离开是和我母亲的儿子加茂塔赫，一起去猎熊了。而且加茂塔赫和一只大熊打起来了。我们三天没有吃肉，加茂塔赫的胳膊不强壮，腿脚也不敏捷。那只大熊就那么攻击了他，直到他的骨头像枯树枝一样被折断。至此，我发现他病得很重，躺在地上呻吟。没有肉，我又杀不了什么能给病人吃的东西。”","“Thou dost not understand, Kinoos,” Negore said gently.“But I shall make thee understand.Know that I was away on the hunt of the bear, with Kamo-tah, my mother’s son.And Kamo-tah fought with a great bear.We had no meat for three days, and Kamo-tah was not strong of arm nor swift of foot.And the great bear crushed him, so, till his bones cracked like dry sticks.Thus I found him, very sick and groaning upon the ground.And there was no meat, nor could I kill aught that the sick man might eat."
"“所以我说，‘我要回到鲁那托，带些食物给你，再带一些强壮的人来抬你到营地。’加茂塔赫说：‘去鲁那托拿食物吧，但是对于发生在我身上的事情，一个字都不要提。当我吃完东西，伤好了有力了，我要杀死那只熊。那时，我会光荣地回到鲁那托，没有人会嘲笑并且说‘加茂塔赫被一只熊击败了。’”","“So I said, ‘I will go to Nulato and bring thee food, also strong men to carry thee to camp.’ And Kamo-tah said, ‘Go thou to Nulato and get food, but say no word of what has befallen me.And when I have eaten, and am grown well and strong, I will kill this bear.Then will I return in honor to Nulato, and no man may laugh and say Kamo-tah was undone by a bear.’”"
"所以我把我兄弟的话记在心里；当我回到鲁那托时，那个俄国人，伊凡将他的狗鞭抽打在我的身上，我知道我决不能抗争。因为没有人知道加茂塔赫，病了饿着肚子呻吟着；如果我和伊凡作战死掉了，那我的弟弟也会死去。乌纳，这就是你看到的，我像一条狗似的被人打。”","So I gave heed to my brother’s words; and when I was come to Nulato, and the Russian, Ivan, laid the lash of his dog-whip upon me, I knew I must not fight.For no man knew of Kamo-tah, sick and groaning and hungry; and did I fight with Ivan, and die, then would my brother die, too.So it was, Oona, that thou sawest me beaten like a dog."
"“那时，我听到了巫医和酋长的谈话，俄国人将怪病带给我们，杀死男人，掳掠女人，而且这片土地必须被清理干净。正如我所说，我听到了那次谈话，知道那是会带来极好结果的谈话，知道那晚俄国人将被杀死。但我的弟弟，加茂塔赫，病了，呻吟着，还没有肉吃；所以我不能留下来，同人民和还不是猎手的男孩们一起作战。”","“Then I heard the talk of the shamans and chiefs that the Russians had brought strange sicknesses upon the people, and killed our men, and stolen our women, and that the land must be made clean.As I say, I heard the talk, and I knew it for good talk, and I knew that in the night the Russians were to be killed.But there was my brother, Kamo-tah, sick and groaning and with no meat; so I could not stay and fight with the men and the boys not yet hunters."
"“我带着肉和鱼，以及伊凡打我的鞭痕回去，却发现加茂塔赫不再呻吟了，他死了。然后我回到鲁那托，看到鲁那托不复存在——大堡垒矗立的地方只有灰烬和很多尸体。我看到俄国人乘着船沿育空河而上，很多俄国人刚出海；我看到伊凡从他躲藏的地方爬出来，和他们说话。第二天，我看到伊凡带领着他们，追踪部落的踪迹。直到现在，他们仍在追踪部落的踪迹，我，内戈雷，在这儿，但不是胆小鬼。”","“And I took with me meat and fish, and the lash-marks of Ivan, and I found Kamo-tah no longer groaning, but dead.Then I went back to Nulato, and, behold, there was no Nulato—only ashes where the great fort had stood, and the bodies of many men.And I saw the Russians come up the Yukon in boats, fresh from the sea, many Russians; and I saw Ivan creep forth from where he lay hid and make talk with them.And the next day I saw Ivan lead them upon the trail of the tribe.Even now are they upon the trail, and I am here, Negore, but no coward.”"
"“这只是你的一面之词，”乌纳说，尽管她的声音比先前温柔了些，“加茂塔赫死了，不能为你说话，我只知道那些我知道的事情，我必须亲眼看到你不是胆小鬼。”","“This is a tale I hear,” said Oona, though her voice was gentler than before.“Kamo-tah is dead and cannot speak for thee, and I know only what I know, and I must know thee of my own eyes for no coward.”"
"内戈雷做了一个不耐烦的手势。","Negore made an impatient gesture."
"“有各种办法来证明你不是，”她补充说，“你愿意做不亚于老基努斯做过的事情吗？”","“There be ways and ways,” she added.“Art thou willing to do no less than what Old Kinoos hath done?”"
"他点点头，等着。","He nodded his head, and waited."
"“正如你所说，这些俄国人现在还在找我们。内戈雷，你去给他们带路，就像老基努斯给他们带路那样，那样他们来的时候就会毫无防备，把他们带到岩石上的一条通道里，我们在那里等着他们。你很清楚那个地方，那里的墙虽说塌了，但还是很高。那时我们就能消灭他们，甚至能将伊凡消灭。当他们像苍蝇一样爬上墙，离墙顶和墙根一样近时，我们的人将用长矛、弓箭和枪支从上面和下面袭击他们。女人和孩子从上面松开大岩石，砸向他们。那会是个好日子，因为俄国人会被杀死，这块土地就干净了，伊凡，甚至挖出我父亲眼睛，用狗鞭抽打你的伊凡，都将会被杀死。他会像条疯狗似的死去，在岩石下吐出最后一口气。当战斗开始，你，内戈雷，就要悄悄地爬开，那样你就不会被杀死。”","“As thou hast said, they seek for us even now, these Russians.Show them the way, Negore, even as Old Kinoos showed them the way, so that they come, unprepared, to where we wait for them, in a passage up the rocks.Thou knowest the place, where the wall is broken and high.Then will we destroy them, even Ivan.When they cling like flies to the wall, and top is no less near than bottom, our men shall fall upon them from above and either side, with spears, and arrows, and guns.And the women and children, from above, shall loosen the great rocks and hurl them down upon them.It will be a great day, for the Russians will be killed, the land will be made clean, and Ivan, even Ivan who thrust out my father’s eyes and laid the lash of his dog-whip upon thee, will be killed.Like a dog gone mad will he die, his breath crushed out of him beneath the rocks.And when the fighting begins, it is for thee, Negore, to crawl secretly away so that thou be not slain.”"
"“即使被杀死，”他回答道，“内戈雷也会给他们带路。然后呢？”","“Even so,” he answered.“Negore will show them the way.And then?”"
"“然后我会成为你的女人，内戈雷的女人，勇敢男人的女人。到时你为我和老基努斯去打猎，我为你做饭，为你缝制温暖而坚韧的皮制大衣，用我们族民的方法给你做一双鹿皮鞋，这方法比你们的要好。正如我说的，我会是你的女人，内戈雷，永远是你的女人。我会使你的生活愉悦，让你的日子里都是欢声笑语，你就会知道，乌纳这个女人跟其他所有女人不一样，因为她曾旅行到过很远的地方，在陌生的地方生活过，跟男人一样聪明，能让你同他们一样快乐。当你老了，她仍然会使你感到快活，你对她年轻时的回忆会是甜蜜的，因为你一直都知道，对你来说她就是安逸、安宁和轻松，她对你来说，超过了其他男人拥有的所有女人。”","“And then I shall be thy woman, Negore’s woman, the brave man’s woman.And thou shalt hunt meat for me and Old Kinoos, and I shall cook thy food, and sew thee warm parkas and strong, and make thee moccasins after the way of my people, which is a better way than thy people’s way.And as I say, I shall be thy woman, Negore, always thy woman.And I shall make thy life glad for thee, so that all thy days will be a song and laughter, and thou wilt know the woman Oona as unlike all other women, for she has journeyed far, and lived in strange places, and is wise in the ways of men and in the ways they may be made glad.And in thine old age will she still make thee glad, and thy memory of her in the days of thy strength will be sweet, for thou wilt know always that she was ease to thee, and peace, and rest, and that beyond all women to other men has she been woman to thee.”"
"“即使这样。”内戈雷说，对她的那种渴望困扰着他的心，他的手伸向了她，就像一个饥饿的人伸手去拿食物。","“Even so,” said Negore, and the hunger for her ate at his heart, and his arms went out for her as a hungry man’s arms might go out for food."
"“等你带完路，内戈雷。”她责备道，但她的目光柔和而温暖，他知道她看他的方式，以前从来没有女人那样看过他。","“When thou hast shown the way, Negore,” she chided him; but her eyes were soft, and warm, and he knew she looked upon him as woman had never looked before."
"“好的。”他说着，毅然转过身，“我现在去和酋长谈谈，他们就会知道，我要去给俄国人带路。”","“It is well”, he said, turning resolutely on his heel.“I go now to make talk with the chiefs, so that they may know I am gone to show the Russians the way.”"
"“哦，内戈雷，我的男人！我的男人！”看着他离开，她自言自语着，但她的声音太轻了，就连老基努斯都没有听到，尽管失明，他的耳朵却相当灵敏。","“Oh, Negore, my man! my man!” she said to herself, as she watched him go, but she said it so softly that even Old Kinoos did not hear, and his ears were over keen, what of his blindness."
"三天后，巧妙地暴露了他的藏身之所，内戈雷像只老鼠似的被拉到伊凡面前——“伊凡，那个可怕的人”跟在他后面的人都知道他。内戈雷带着一个令人难受的刺骨长矛，兔皮长袍紧紧地裹在身上，虽然天气暖和，但他却像得了疟疾似的颤抖着。他摇摇头，表示没有明白伊凡对他说的话，并且看上去他很疲惫，生病了，他只希望坐下休息一会儿，同时指指他的肚子表示他病了，并猛烈地颤抖着。但是伊凡带着一个从帕斯特利克来的人，他说内戈雷的语言，他们问内戈雷有关他部落的许多问题都是徒劳，直到那个来自帕斯特利克叫卡杜克的人，说道：","Three days later, having with craft ill-concealed his hiding-place, Negore was dragged forth like a rat and brought before Ivan—“Ivan the Terrible” he was known by the men who marched at his back.Negore was armed with a miserable bone-barbed spear, and he kept his rabbit-skin robe wrapped closely about him, and though the day was warm he shivered as with an ague.He shook his head that he did not understand the speech Ivan put at him, and made that he was very weary and sick, and wished only to sit down and rest, pointing the while to his stomach in sign of his sickness, and shivering fiercely.But Ivan had with him a man from Pastolik who talked the speech of Negore, and many and vain were the questions they asked him concerning his tribe, till the man from Pastolik, who was called Karduk, said:"
"“这是伊凡的命令，如果你不说话，你会被鞭打到死。要知道，陌生的兄弟，在我告诉你伊凡的话就是法律时，我是你的朋友，而不是伊凡的。因为我不愿意从我海边的国家来到这里，而且我极度渴望活下去；因此我服从我主人的意愿——陌生的兄弟，如果你聪明，也想要活下去，你就会服从的。”","“It is the word of Ivan that thou shalt be lashed till thou diest if thou dost not speak.And know, strange brother, when I tell thee the word of Ivan is the law, that I am thy friend and no friend of Ivan.For I come not willingly from my country by the sea, and I desire greatly to live; wherefore I obey the will of my master—as thou wilt obey, strange brother, if thou art wise, and wouldst live.”"
"“不，陌生的兄弟。”内戈雷答道，“我不知道我的族民所走的路线，因为我病了，而他们走得太快，我的双腿筋疲力尽，我就掉队了。”","“Nay, strange brother,” Negore answered, “I know not the way my people are gone, for I was sick, and they fled so fast my legs gave out from under me, and I fell behind.”"
"当卡杜克跟伊凡说话的时候，内戈雷等着。然后内戈雷看到伊凡的脸阴了下来，他看着两个人走到他两边，啪啪地甩着他们的鞭子。因此他被吓坏了，大声喊着说他病了，什么都不知道，但他会将他知道的事情说出来。他说出这个意愿后，伊凡对他的人下令行军，内戈雷的两边都跟着拿着鞭子的人，这样他就不能逃跑。他由于生病太虚弱了，东倒西歪地走着，远不如他们走得快，他们就用鞭子抽打他，直到他痛苦地尖叫，迸发出新的力气。卡杜克告诉他，当他们追上他的部落时，他就能享福了，他问：“那时我就可以休息，不用再动了？”","Negore waited while Karduk talked with Ivan.Then Negore saw the Russian’s face go dark, and he saw the men step to either side of him, snapping the lashes of their whips.Whereupon he betrayed a great fright, and cried aloud that he was a sick man and knew nothing, but would tell what he knew.And to such purpose did he tell, that Ivan gave the word to his men to march, and on either side of Negore marched the men with the whips, that he might not run away.And when he made that he was weak of his sickness, and stumbled and walked not so fast as they walked, they laid their lashes upon him till he screamed with pain and discovered new strength.And when Karduk told him all would be well with him when they had overtaken his tribe, he asked, “And then may I rest and move not?”"
"他继续问道：“那时我就可以休息，不用再动了？”","Continually he asked, “And then may I rest and move not?”"
"他看起来病得非常严重，无神的眼睛环顾四周，他注意到了伊凡的人的战斗力，并为伊凡没有认出他就是在堡垒前被他鞭打的那个人而感到满意。他无神的眼睛看到的是一批奇怪的追随者。有斯拉夫尼亚猎人，皮肤白皙，肌肉强健；有矮胖的芬兰人，长着扁扁的鼻子、圆圆的脸；有混血的西伯利亚人，他们的鼻子更像是鹰嘴；瘦瘦的斜眼的人，他们的血管里流着蒙古人、鞑靼人和斯拉夫人的血液。他们是来自白令海那边的遥远地方的野外探险家、侵略者和破坏者，他们用火和剑摧毁了新的未知世界，贪婪地攫取皮毛和兽皮等财富。内戈雷满意地看着他们，在他的脑海里，他看到在岩石上的通道上，他们被压扁，都没命了。他曾看到乌纳的脸和身形，她在岩石上的通道里正等着他呢，他曾在耳畔听到她的声音，感受到了她柔和、温暖的目光。但他从没有忘记发抖，也没有忘记跌倒在高低不平的地方，没忘记鞭子一打在身上就大声喊叫。并且他怕卡杜克，因为他知道，他不是一个真正的男人。他有一只假眼，容易上当受骗——他判断，太容易好骗的人说实话都会觉得尴尬。","And while he appeared very sick and looked about him with dull eyes, he noted the fighting strength of Ivan’s men, and noted with satisfaction that Ivan did not recognize him as the man he had beaten before the gates of the fort.It was a strange following his dull eyes saw.There were Slavonian hunters, fair-skinned and mighty-muscled; short, squat Finns, with flat noses and round faces; Siberian half-breeds, whose noses were more like eagle- beaks; and lean, slant-eyed men, who bore in their veins the Mongol and Tartar blood as well as the blood of the Slav.Wild adventurers they were, forayers and destroyers from the far lands beyond the Sea of Bering, who blasted the new and unknown world with fire and sword and clutched greedily for its wealth of fur and hide.Negore looked upon them with satisfaction, and in his mind’s eye he saw them crushed and lifeless at the passage up the rocks.And ever he saw, waiting for him at the passage up the rocks, the face and the form of Oona, and ever he heard her voice in his ears and felt the soft, warm glow of her eyes.But never did he forget to shiver, nor to stumble where the footing was rough, nor to cry aloud at the bite of the lash.Also, he was afraid of Karduk, for he knew him for no true man.His was a false eye, and an easy tongue—a tongue too easy, he judged, for the awkwardness of honest speech."
"他们一整天都在行军。第二天，当卡杜克受伊凡命令问他时，他说他猜想明天之前可能会遇到他的部落。但是伊凡，曾让老基努斯带过路，发现那条路通向激流和致命的一战，不再相信任何话。因此当他们来到岩石上的通道时，他让四十个人都停下来，让卡杜克去问问这条路是否安全。","All that day they marched.And on the next, when Karduk asked him at command of Ivan, he said he doubted they would meet with his tribe till the morrow.But Ivan, who had once been shown the way by Old Kinoos, and had found that way to lead through the white water and a deadly fight, believed no more in anything.So when they came to a passage up the rocks, he halted his forty men, and through Karduk demanded if the way were clear."
"内戈雷短促又漫不经心地看了一下。一个巨大的山崩毁坏了直直的崖壁，上面长满了灌木丛和蔓生植物，那儿可能已经藏好了几个部落的人。","Negore looked at it shortly and carelessly.It was a vast slide that broke the straight wall of a cliff, and was overrun with brush and creeping plants, where a score of tribes could have lain well hidden."
"他摇摇头。“不，那里什么都没有，”他说，“这条路是安全的。”","He shook his head.“Nay, there be nothing there,” he said.“The way is clear.”"
"伊凡又跟卡杜克说话了，然后卡杜克说：","Again Ivan spoke to Karduk, and Karduk said:"
"“要知道，陌生的兄弟，如果你说的不准，如果你的人拦住了路，袭击伊凡和他的人，你就会马上没命。”","“Know, strange brother, if thy talk be not straight, and if thy people block the way and fall upon Ivan and his men, that thou shalt die, and at once.”"
"“我说的是实话。”内戈雷说，“这条路是安全的。”","“My talk is straight,” Negore said.“The way is clear.”"
"伊凡还是不相信，他命令两个斯拉夫猎人独自登上去。他命另外两个人走到内戈雷的旁边。他们把枪抵在他的胸口上，等待着。所有人都等着。内戈雷知道，如果有一只箭飞出，或者有一杆矛挥动，那么他的死期就到了。两个斯拉夫猎人费劲地爬上去，他们变得越来越小，当他们到达山顶，挥舞着帽子示意什么事都没有时，在天空的映衬下，他们就像黑色的斑点。","Still Ivan doubted, and ordered two of his Slavonian hunters to go up alone.Two other men he ordered to the side of Negore.They placed their guns against his breast and waited.All waited.And Negore knew, should one arrow fly, or one spear be flung, that his death would come upon him.The two Slavonian hunters toiled upward till they grew small and smaller, and when they reached the top and waved their hats that all was well, they were like black specks against the sky."
"内戈雷胸前的枪被放了下来，伊凡命令他的手下走在前面。伊凡沉默不语，陷入了沉思。他行进了一个小时，似乎迷惑了，然后通过卡杜克的翻译，他对内戈雷说：","The guns were lowered from Negore’s breast and Ivan gave the order for his men to go forward.Ivan was silent, lost in thought.For an hour he marched, as though puzzled, and then, through Karduk’s mouth, he said to Negore:"
"“你只是简单地看了一下，怎么就知道这条路是安全的呢？”","“How didst thou know the way was clear when thou didst look so briefly upon it?”"
"内戈雷想起他看到过那些栖息在岩石间和灌木上的小鸟，然后他笑了，就这么简单，但他耸耸肩膀没有回答。因为他同样在想，他们马上就要到达岩石上的另一条通道了，那里的小鸟大概都飞走了。他很高兴卡杜克来自大雾海，那里没y有树,也没有灌木丛，那里的人们学习的是水上技艺，而不是陆地和森林技艺。","Negore thought of the little birds he had seen perched among the rocks and upon the bushes, and smiled, it was so simple; but he shrugged his shoulders and made no answer.For he was thinking, likewise, of another passage up the rocks, to which they would soon come, and where the little birds would all be gone.And he was glad that Karduk came from the Great Fog Sea, where there were no trees or bushes, and where men learned water-craft instead of land- craft and wood-craft."
"三个小时后，当太阳升到头顶，他们来到岩石上的另一条通道，卡杜克说：","Three hours later, when the sun rode overhead, they came to another passage up the rocks, and Karduk said:"
"“用你的双眼看看，陌生的兄弟，看这条路是否安全，因为这次人们走上去之前，伊凡不介意等候。”","“Look with all thine eyes, strange brother, and see if the way be clear, for Ivan is not minded this time to wait while men go up before.”"
"内戈雷看了看，看的时候有两个人站在他两侧，用枪抵着他的胸口。他看到小鸟全飞走了，他一度看到了步枪枪管上闪过的阳光。他想起了乌纳和她说的话：“当战斗开始，内戈雷，你要悄悄地爬开，那样你就不会被杀死了。”","Negore looked, and he looked with two men by his side, their guns resting against his breast.He saw that the little birds were all gone, and once he saw the glint of sunlight on a rifle-barrel.And he thought of Oona, and of her words: “And when the fighting begins, it is for thee, Negore, to crawl secretly away so that thou be not slain.”"
"他感到两杆枪抵在他的胸口。这不是她计划的方式。不可能秘密地爬开。当战斗开始，他将是第一个死去的人。但他仍然假装用呆滞的目光看了看，假装是由于生病而颤抖，然后坚定地说道：","He felt the two guns pressing on his breast.This was not the way she had planned.There would be no crawling secretly away.He would be the first to die when the fighting began.But he said, and his voice was steady, and he still feigned to see with dull eyes and to shiver from his sickness:"
"“这条路是安全的。”","“The way is clear.”"
"伊凡和来自白令海峡以外遥远地区的那四十个人开始前进。还有来自帕斯特利克的卡杜克以及总被两杆枪抵着的内戈雷。这是一次漫长的攀登，他们无法走得很快；但对于内戈雷来说却非常快了，他们似乎靠近了中点，那里距离墙顶和墙根一样近。","And they started up, Ivan and his forty men from the far lands beyond the Sea of Bering.And there was Karduk, the man from Pastolik, and Negore, with the two guns always upon him.It was a long climb, and they could not go fast; but very fast to Negore they seemed to approach the midway point where top was no less near than bottom."
"右边岩石间的一杆枪发出劈啪声，内戈雷听到了他所有部落成员的战争叫喊声，瞬间看到岩石和灌木都直立了起来，其间挤满了人。然后一股灼热的火焰穿过他的身体，他觉得自己被扯碎了，随着他倒下，他懂得了当生命猛扭肉体要获得自由的时候那剧烈的疼痛。","A gun cracked among the rocks to the right, and Negore heard the war-yell of all his tribe, and for an instant saw the rocks and bushes bristle alive with his kinfolk.Then he felt torn asunder by a burst of flame hot through his being, and as he fell he knew the sharp pangs of life as it wrenches at the flesh to be free."
"但他像一个吝啬鬼似的，紧紧抓住生命不放。他仍然呼吸着空气，空气以一种痛苦的甜蜜刺激着他的肺；短时间的失明和失聪后，他又朦胧地看到了闪现的情景，又听到了声音，其中他看到伊凡的猎人开始死去，他自己的兄弟们正在点火射击进行大屠杀，空气因他们的叫喊和武器的声音而一片混乱，女人和孩子们高高在上，松开大岩石。","But he gripped his life with a miser’s clutch and would not let it go.He still breathed the air, which bit his lungs with a painful sweetness; and dimly he saw and heard, with passing spells of blindness and deafness, the flashes of sight and sound again wherein he saw the hunters of Ivan falling to their deaths, and his own brothers fringing the carnage and filling the air with the tumult of their cries and weapons, and, far above, the women and children loosing the great rocks that leaped like things alive and thundered down."
"太阳在他头上的天空中跳动着，巨大的墙壁旋转摇晃着，他仍然能朦胧地听到、看到。当高贵的伊凡别着腿倒下，猛摔在那里断了气，又被猛冲下来的岩石压碎的时候，他想起了老基努斯瞎了的眼睛，心里非常高兴。","The sun danced above him in the sky, the huge walls reeled and swung, and still he heard and saw dimly.And when the great Ivan fell across his legs, hurled there lifeless and crushed by a down- rushing rock, he remembered the blind eyes of Old Kinoos and was glad."
"然后声音逐渐消失，岩石不再像巨雷般滚过，他看到他部落的人民爬得越来越近，边靠近边刺杀受伤的人。在他附近，他听到一个强壮的斯拉夫猎手的扭打声，不愿死去，直起的半身被渴望杀戮的长矛击倒了。","Then the sounds died down, and the rocks no longer thundered past, and he saw his tribespeople creeping close and closer, spearing the wounded as they came.And near to him he heard the scuffle of a mighty Slavonian hunter, loath to die, and, half uprisen, borne back and down by the thirsty spears."
"然后在他上方，他看到了乌纳的脸，感觉到了乌纳的手臂；一会儿太阳停下不动了，高墙挺立着一动不动。","Then he saw above him the face of Oona, and felt about him the arms of Oona; and for a moment the sun steadied and stood still, and the great walls were upright and moved not."
"“你是一个勇敢的人，内戈雷。”他听到她在他耳畔说，“你是我的男人，内戈雷。”","“Thou art a brave man, Negore,” he heard her say in his ear; “thou art my man, Negore.”"
"在那一刻，他过上了她说过的愉快生活，生活里都是欢声笑语，当太阳离开了他上方的天空，当他老去，他知道有关她的回忆是甜蜜的。回忆变得逐渐模糊，消失在他周围的黑暗里，他知道她许诺给他的所有的轻松和安逸在她的怀里实现了。随着黑夜吞没了他，他的头靠在她的胸前，他感到极大的安宁包围着他，他察觉到了很多黄昏的静寂和无声的奥秘。","And in that moment he lived all the life of gladness of which she had told him, and the laughter and the song, and as the sun went out of the sky above him, as in his old age, he knew the memory of her was sweet.And as even the memories dimmed and died in the darkness that fell upon him, he knew in her arms the fulfilment of all the ease and rest she had promised him.And as black night wrapped around him, his head upon her breast, he felt a great peace steal about him, and he was aware of the hush of many twilights and the mystery of silence."
