"警察与赞美诗","The Cop and the Anthem"
"作者：欧·亨利","By O Henry"
"索比在麦迪逊广场的长椅上坐卧不宁，很不自在。每当群雁鸣唱高歌黑夜时，每当没有海豹皮衣的女人对丈夫变得亲热时，每当索比在公园的长椅上坐卧不宁时，你也许就会知道，冬天已经近在眼前了。 ","On his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily.When wild geese honk high of nights, and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands, and when Soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park, you may know that winter is near at hand."
"一片枯叶落在索比的大腿上。那是杰克·弗罗斯特的名片。杰克对麦迪逊广场的常住居民很友善，每年造访前，他都会发出公正的警告。他会在四条大街的转角处，把自己的名片交给所有户外宅第的仆从北风，好让那里的居民们有所准备。 ","A dead leaf fell in Soapy’s lap.That was Jack Frost’s card.Jack is kind to the regular denizens of Madison Square, and gives fair warning of his annual call.At the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the North Wind, footman of the mansion of All Outdoors, so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready."
"索比想明白了，是时候下定决心组成一个单人的财务委员会了，以便为即将来临的严寒做好准备。正因为如此，他才会在长椅上坐卧不宁。","Soapy’s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular Committee of Ways and Means to provide against the coming rigour.And therefore he moved uneasily on his bench."
"索比对过冬的抱负并不高。他既没想过去地中海巡游，也没想过在南部那令人犯困的天空下漂流维苏威海湾。能在那个岛上呆三个月就是他梦寐以求的了。三个月伙食不愁，床位无忧，有意气相投的同伴，还能免受北风之神和警察的骚扰，这些似乎再令索比满意不过了。","The hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest.In them there were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of soporific Southern skies drifting in the Vesuvian Bay.Three months on the Island was what his soul craved.Three months of assured board and bed and congenial company, safe from Boreas and bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable."
"多年来，好客的布莱克韦尔岛的监狱就是索比冬天的住处。正像比他幸运的纽约同胞每年冬天买票去棕榈滩和里维埃拉一样，索比也要为他一年一度跑到岛上的逃亡做些简单的安排。而现在是时候了。前一天晚上，他睡在古老广场上离喷泉不远的长椅上，把三份安息日的报纸一份垫在外套的下面、一份包着脚踝、一份盖着大腿，但还是没能驱走寒冷。因此，岛屿的样子又适时而鲜明地浮现在索比的脑海中。那些以慈善的名义为城市里的弱势群体提供的供给他都不屑一顾。在索比看来，法律比慈善更为仁义。市政府和慈善机构办了数不清的组织，他可以从这些地方开始，蹭吃蹭住，简单过活。但对于像索比这样有着高傲灵魂的人而言，接受慈善机构的馈赠是一种拖累。从慈善机构的手里收到的每一份救济，你即使不用钱支付，也必须以灵魂蒙羞为代价。正如恺撒接待布鲁特斯一样，慈善机构给你一张床睡，你就一定得付出洗澡的代价；慈善机构给你一片面包吃，你就必须得先接受有关个人隐私的调查。因此做法律的客人更好，虽然要照章办事，但法律不会过分地干涉绅士的私事。 ","For years the hospitable Blackwell’s had been his winter quarters.Just as his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach and the Riviera each winter, so Soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the Island.And now the time was come.On the previous night three Sabbath newspapers, distributed beneath his coat, about his ankles and over his lap, had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square.So the Island loomed big and timely in Soapy’s mind.He scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city’s dependents.In Soapy’s opinion the Law was more benign than Philanthropy.There was an endless round of institutions, municipal and eleemosynary, on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life.But to one of Soapy’s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered.If not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy.As Caesar had his Brutus, every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath, every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition.Wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law, which though conducted by rules, does not meddle unduly with a gentleman’s private affairs."
"索比既然已经决定去布莱克韦尔岛，就立刻着手实现自己的愿望。做到这一点，有很多简便的办法。其中最惬意的莫过于在某家高档的餐馆奢侈地吃一顿，然后再宣布无力支付，接着就会被悄无声息地交给警察。乐于助人的治安法官会把其他一切事情都处理好的。","Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his desire.There were many easy ways of doing this.The pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant; and then, after declaring insolvency, be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman.An accommodating magistrate would do the rest."
"索比离开长椅，漫步走出广场，穿过百老汇大街和第五大街交汇处的那片平坦的柏油马路。他转弯来到百老汇大街，停在一家灯火辉煌的咖啡馆门前，每天晚上葡萄、蚕丝和原生质的精选制品都会聚集在这里。 ","Soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt, where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow together.Up Broadway he turned, and halted at a glittering cafe, where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape, the silkworm and the protoplasm."
"索比对自己马甲最下面那颗纽扣以上的部分都有信心。他刮净了胡子，上衣也穿得很得体，整洁的黑领带打着活结，是感恩节那天一位女传教士送给他的。如果他在走到餐馆一个餐桌的过程中没有引起别人的怀疑，那么成功就属于他了。他在餐桌以上露出的部分绝不会让侍者生疑。索比想，一只烤野鸭估计就足够了，另加一瓶夏布利酒，还有卡门贝干酪，一小杯清咖啡和一只雪茄烟。雪茄一美元的就够了。总的花费不能太高，以免引起餐馆管理人员过于激烈的报复；但这顿饭也要足以让他心满意足、开开心心地踏上他的冬季避难旅程。 ","Soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward.He was shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, ready-tied four-in-hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on Thanksgiving Day.If he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his.The portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter’s mind.A roasted mallard duck, thought Soapy, would be about the thing—with a bottle of Chablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse and a cigar.One dollar for the cigar would be enough.The total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management; and yet the meal would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge."
"然而，索比刚踏进餐馆的大门，侍者领班的目光便落在了他那磨破的裤子和不像样的鞋子上。强壮的双手随即推他转了个身，安静又迅速地打发他回到人行道上，使那只险遭威胁的野鸭逃脱了卑微的命运。","But as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter’s eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes.Strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard."
"索比转弯离开了百老汇。靠一顿美餐踏上梦寐以求的岛屿似乎是实现不了了。要进监狱必须得另寻其他途径了。 ","Soapy turned off Broadway.It seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one.Some other way of entering limbo must be thought of."
"在第六大街的转角处，厚玻璃板后面的电灯和巧妙陈列的商品使商店的橱窗很抢眼。索比捡起一块鹅卵石，朝玻璃窗狠狠地砸去。人们从转角跑来，领头的就是一名警察。索比一动不动地站着，双手插在口袋里，看到黄铜纽扣的时候马上微笑起来。","At a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous.Soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass.People came running around the corner, a policeman in the lead.Soapy stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of brass buttons."
"“肇事的小子在哪儿？”警官激动地询问。 ","“Where’s the man that done that?” inquired the officer excitedly."
"“难道你不觉得我和这事儿有关系吗？”索比不无讽刺、但友好地说，就像一个人交上了好运似的。","“Don’t you figure out that I might have had something to do with it?” said Soapy, not without sarcasm, but friendly, as one greets good fortune."
"警察根本不相信索比的话，甚至觉得这连条线索都算不上。打碎橱窗的人是不会留下来和法律的奴才谈判的。他们早就溜了。警察看到在离自己半个街区外有一个人正跑着追一辆汽车。他拿着抽出的警棍就加入了追捕当中。索比心里很反感，继续沿着街游荡，两次他都失败了。","The policeman’s mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue.Men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law’s minions.They take to their heels.The policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car.With drawn club he joined in the pursuit.Soapy, with disgust in his heart, loafed along, twice unsuccessful."
"在街道对面有一家不太起眼的餐馆。这个餐馆正迎合了那些胃口大、钱包瘪的人。那里的陶制餐具粗笨、空气污浊、汤水很稀、餐巾很薄。索比穿着揭发真相的鞋子和暴露实情的裤子走了进去，并没有遭到任何人的怀疑。他在一个餐桌前坐了下来，大口吃完了牛排、烙饼、炸面圈和馅饼。然后，他向侍者道出了事实，他本人连面值最小的钱币也没见过。","On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions.It catered to large appetites and modest purses.Its crockery and atmosphere were thick; its soup and napery thin.Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge.At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flapjacks, doughnuts and pie.And then to the waiter he betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers."
"“现在，赶紧叫警察吧。”索比说，“不要让一位绅士等得太久。”","“Now, get busy and call a cop,” said Soapy.“And don’t keep a gentleman waiting.”"
"“对付你这种人根本用不着警察。”侍者说，声音腻得像抹了黄油的蛋糕，眼睛红得像曼哈顿鸡尾酒里的樱桃。“喂，康！”","“No cop for youse,” said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail.“Hey, Con!”"
"索比左耳着地，干净利落地被两个侍者扔到了硬邦邦的人行道上。索比就像木匠的折尺被打开一样慢慢地站起来，拍了拍衣服上的尘土。被捕仿佛只是个美梦。那个岛屿好像非常遥远。一名警察站在距离那里两个店面远的一家药店门前，他笑了笑、沿着街道走开了。","Neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched Soapy.He arose, joint by joint, as a carpenter’s rule opens, and beat the dust from his clothes.Arrest seemed but a rosy dream.The Island seemed very far away.A policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street."
"索比走过五个街区，才又一次鼓起设法被捕的勇气。这回摆在他面前的时机让他愚蠢地以为这一次能万无一失。一位衣着朴素、招人喜欢的年轻女子正站在橱窗前，兴致勃勃地盯着里面陈列的刮脸用的大杯子和墨水瓶。两码之外，一位身材魁梧、表情严肃的警察正斜靠在防火栓上。","Five blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again.This time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a “cinch.”A young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug."
"索比打算扮演成卑鄙可憎的“调戏妇女”的角色。他的受害者长相文雅娴静，临近又有一名恪尽职守的警察，这次他相信，警察很快就会抓住自己的手臂，这多么令人愉快啊，他的冬季保证能在小得恰到好处的岛上度过了。","It was Soapy’s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated “masher.”The refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little, tight little isle."
"索比把女传教士给他系好的领带弄直，把缩进去的袖口拽出来，把帽子歪戴得差点掉下来，然后就偷偷地侧着身子朝那位年轻女子走去。他对她抛媚眼，突然咳嗽清嗓子，还摆出一副傻乎乎嬉皮笑脸的样子，把调戏妇女那一套都厚颜无耻地表演了一遍，既无礼又卑鄙。他一眼就瞥到那个警察正死死地盯着他。那位年轻女子挪开几步，又把注意力全都转移到那些刮脸用的大杯子上。索比跟过去，大胆地走到她身边，拿起帽子，说：“啊，比德莉亚！你不想来我的院子里玩玩吗？”","Soapy straightened the lady missionary’s readymade tie, dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open, set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman.He made eyes at her, was taken with sudden coughs and “hems,” smiled, smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the “masher.”With half an eye Soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly.The young woman moved away a few steps, and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs.Soapy followed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his hat and said: “Ah there, Bedelia!Don’t you want to come and play in my yard?”"
"那名警察仍然看着。受害的年轻女子只要用手指示意一下，索比事实上就踏上去小岛避难所的旅程了。他已经想象他能感觉到警察局那令人惬意的温暖了。那位年轻女子面冲着他，伸出一只手抓住了索比的外套袖子。","The policeman was still looking.The persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven.Already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station-house.The young woman faced him and, stretching out a hand, caught Soapy’s coat sleeve."
"“当然了，迈克，”她兴致勃勃地说，“只要你愿意破费给我买一桶啤酒。我早就和你搭话了，可那个警察一直盯着这儿看。”","“Sure, Mike,” she said joyfully, “if you’ll blow me to a pail of suds.I’d have spoke to you sooner, but the cop was watching.”"
"那个年轻女子像常春藤一样攀附着他这棵橡树，索比从警察的旁边走过，沮丧极了。似乎命中注定他就该自由。","With the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak Soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom.He seemed doomed to liberty."
"在下一个转角处，他甩开他的同伴跑掉了。接着他在一个地方停了下来，那里的夜晚有最明亮的街道、最轻松的心情、最轻浮的誓言和最欢快的歌剧。穿着皮衣的女士和套着厚外套的男士在寒冷的空气中快乐地穿行。索比突然感到一阵恐惧，某种可怕的魔法已经使他对被捕免疫了。这个念头使他有点发慌。但是，当他又看到警察在灯火辉煌的剧院前大摇大摆地闲逛时，他立刻抓住了“扰乱治安”这根稻草。 ","At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran.He halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets, hearts, vows and librettos.Women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air.A sudden fear seized Soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest.The thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of “disorderly conduct.”"
"索比在人行道上用他那刺耳的嗓音使劲喊，像喝醉一般胡言乱语。他手舞足蹈、大吼大叫、胡言乱语，还用其他方法来搅乱这片天空。","On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice.He danced, howled, raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin."
"警察迅速旋转着警棍，转身背对着索比，对一位市民解释说：“这个耶鲁小子正在庆祝他们让哈特福德学院吃了个鸭蛋呢。是有些吵，但也无妨。我们已经接到指示，可以不管他们。” ","The policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and remarked to a citizen: “‘Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin’the goose egg they give to the Hartford College.Noisy; but no harm.We’ve instructions to leave them be.”"
"真郁闷，索比停止了白费力气的吵闹。难道警察永远不抓他了吗？他幻想中的小岛仿佛成了无法企及的阿卡狄亚。他扣紧单薄的外套，以抵挡刺骨的寒风。 ","Disconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket.Would never a policeman lay hands on him?In his fancy the Island seemed an unattainable Arcadia.He buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind."
"在一家雪茄店里，他看到一位穿着讲究的男士正对着摇曳的火苗点雪茄。他一进店就把他的丝绸雨伞搁在门边了。索比走进店里，拿住伞然后慢悠悠地走开了。点雪茄的那位男士慌忙地跟了上来。 ","In a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light.His silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering.Soapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly.The man at the cigar light followed hastily."
"“那是我的伞。”他厉声说道。","“My umbrella,” he said, sternly."
"“哦，是吗？”索比冷笑着说，轻微盗窃罪再加侮辱罪，“那么，那你为什么不叫警察呢？我就把它拿走了。你的伞！你为什么不叫警察呢？街角就站着一个呢。” ","“Oh, is it?” sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny.“Well, why don’t you call a policeman?I took it.Your umbrella!Why don’t you call a cop?There stands one on the corner.”"
"雨伞的主人放慢了脚步。索比也慢了下来，他有一种预感，好运又要背他而去了。那位警察好奇地看着这两个人。","The umbrella owner slowed his steps.Soapy did likewise, with a presentiment that luck would again run against him.The policeman looked at the two curiously."
"“当然，”雨伞的主人说：“就是说——您知道的，这类误会时有发生——我——如果那是您的伞，我希望您能原谅我——它是我今天早上在一个餐馆捡的——如果您认出那是您的伞，那么——我希望您——” ","“Of course,” said the umbrella man—“that is—well, you know how these mistakes occur—I—if it’s your umbrella I hope you’ll excuse me—I picked it up this morning in a restaurant—If you recognise it as yours, why—I hope you’ll—”"
"“这当然是我的伞了。”索比凶巴巴地说。 ","“Of course it’s mine,” said Soapy, viciously."
"雨伞的“前主人”走开了。那名警察赶紧去帮一位身披夜礼服斗篷、金发高个子的女人过马路，以免两街区之外正往这边驶来的街车撞到她。","The ex-umbrella man retreated.The policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away."
"索比穿过一条因翻修而变得坑洼不平的街道，向东走去。他愤怒地把那把雨伞往坑里一扔。他小声地抱怨那些戴头盔、拿警棍的家伙。因为他想落入他们的手中，而他们似乎把他看作是不会犯错的国王。","Soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements.He hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation.He muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs.Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong."
"最后，索比来到通往东区的一条大街上，这里的灯光昏暗，吵闹声也时有时无。他顺着街道走向麦迪逊广场，这是出于想回家的本能，即使这个家只是公园里的一把长椅。 ","At length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint.He set his face down this toward Madison Square, for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench."
"但是，在一个异常宁静的转角处，索比慢慢停了下来。这里有一座古老的教堂，外观古朴，上面蔓生着植物，还带有山形外墙。一扇紫色窗玻璃里透出一缕柔和的光，很显然，风琴师正在那里悠然地拨弄着琴键，确保把安息日的赞美诗练熟。那甜美的音乐飘进索比的耳朵，把他吸引住了，他把身子紧紧地贴在那盘旋形的铁栅栏上。","But on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill.Here was an old church, quaint and rambling and gabled.Through one violet-stained window a soft light glowed, where, no doubt, the organist loitered over the keys, making sure of his mastery of the coming Sabbath anthem.For there drifted out to Soapy’s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence."
"月亮高悬，明亮清澈，车辆和行人都很稀少，屋檐下的麻雀困倦地叫着——一时间，这景象犹如乡村的教堂墓地。风琴手弹奏的赞美诗把索比牢牢地粘在铁栅栏上，因为在他的生活拥有这些东西的时候，譬如母爱、玫瑰、抱负、朋友，以及纯洁的思想和干净的衣领，他曾经对赞美诗非常熟悉。 ","The moon was above, lustrous and serene; vehicles and pedestrians were few; sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves—for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard.And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars."
"索比富于感受的心境和古老教堂产生的影响交织在一起，使他的灵魂突然发生了奇妙的变化。他惊恐地幡然醒悟，他已经坠入了深渊，那些堕落的日子、可耻的欲望、破灭的希望、被毁掉的才能和卑鄙的动机就是他从前生活的全部。 ","The conjunction of Soapy’s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul.He viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled, the degraded days, unworthy desires, dead hopes, wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence."
"而他的内心立即激动地回应着这种异常的情绪。一股突如其来而又强烈的冲动激励他和令人绝望的命运进行抗争。他要把自己拉出泥潭，他要重新做人，他要战胜控制着自己的邪恶。现在还有时间，他还算年轻，他要重拾自己早年的热切抱负，并坚定地去追求它们。那些庄严而又甜美的风琴音符已经在他脑中引发了一场革命。明天，他就去繁华的商业区找工作。有个毛皮进口商曾经主动请他当司机。明天他就去找他，请求得到那个职位。他要做这世界上的大人物。他要——","And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood.An instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate.He would pull himself out of the mire; he would make a man of himself again; he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him.There was time; he was comparatively young yet; he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering.Those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him.To-morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work.A fur importer had once offered him a place as driver.He would find him tomorrow and ask for the position.He would be somebody in the world.He would—"
"索比感到有一只手压在他的手臂上。他很快转过头，看到一个长着宽脸的警察。 ","Soapy felt a hand laid on his arm.He looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman."
"“你在这儿干什么呢？”警官问。 ","“What are you doin’ here?” asked the officer."
"“什么也没干。”索比说。 ","“Nothin’,” said Soapy."
"“那就跟我来吧。”那名警察说。 ","“Then come along,” said the policeman."
"第二天上午，治安法庭的法官判决说：“布莱克韦尔岛，三个月监禁。” ","“Three months on the Island,” said the Magistrate in the Police Court the next morning."
