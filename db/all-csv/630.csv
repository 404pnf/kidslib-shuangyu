"白化士兵","The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier"
"我朋友华生虽然想法不多，仅有的想法却都顽固得出奇。长期以来，他一直在苦苦纠缠，逼着我自己写一篇讲述以往经历的文字。这兴许是我自讨苦吃，因为我经常都得指出他的毛病，说他写的那些故事如何如何肤浅，还说他只知道迎合大众的口味，不懂得严格地遵循事实和数据。“你自个儿试试好了，福尔摩斯！”这就是他的反驳。不容否认的是，提起笔来之后，我自己确实有所体会，既然是写故事，那就必须写成读者爱看的样子。下面这个案子读者肯定爱看，因为它是我那份记录当中最离奇的案子之一，只不过碰巧被华生漏掉了而已。既然说到了我这位老朋友兼传记作者，我不妨趁机补充一点，侦办各种区区小案的时候，我之所以要不辞辛苦地拖上一名同伴，并不是因为我感情用事，也不是因为我突发奇想，而是因为华生确实有他的独到之处，只不过他性情谦退，光顾着过甚其词地吹捧我的事迹，没有留意到他自己的优点。如果你的同伴能够预见你的结论和行动方略，那样的同伴只能说是非常危险，反过来，如果他自始至终都对事态的变化感到惊诧莫名，自始至终都对未来一片茫然，那倒可以算是一位不折不扣的理想助手。","The ideas of my friend Watson,though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own.Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to  popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. “Try it yourself,Holmes!” he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand,I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader.The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection,though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity toremark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which inhis modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances.A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closedbook, is indeed an ideal helpmate."
"按照我记事本里的记录，詹姆斯·M. 多德先生登门造访的时间是一九零三年一月，也就是布尔战[^1]刚刚打完的时候。多德先生是一位魁梧挺拔、朝气蓬勃的英国公民，皮肤被太阳晒得黝黑。那阵子，华生老兄已经做下了我记忆之中唯一的一件只顾自己不顾交情的勾当，抛下我去讨了一个老婆。多德先生上门的时候，屋里只有我一个人。","I find from my notebook that it was in January ,1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War,that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife,the only selfish action which I can recall in our The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier8zw2.indd 321 2013.1.10 2:13:25 PM 322 THE CASE-BOOK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES association. I was alone."
"我的习惯是自己坐在背对窗子的位置，把我对面的椅子留给客人，好让他们完全暴露在天光之下。詹姆斯·M. 多德先生似乎是不知道怎么开口，而我也没有帮助他打破沉默，原因是我可以借此机会多观察他一会儿。我早就已经发现，明智的做法是一上来就让主顾领教一下我的本事，到这会儿，我便把一部分的观察结论说了出来。","It is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls fullupon them. Mr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a losshow to begin the interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions."
"“据我看，先生，您一定是从南非回来的。”","“From South Africa, sir, I perceive.”"
"“是的，先生。”他多少有点儿诧异地回答道。","“Yes, sir,” he answered, with some surprise."
"“以前是在帝国义勇骑兵部队，[^2]应该没错。”","“Imperial Yeomanry , I fancy.”"
"“没错。”","“Exactly.”"
"“米德尔塞克斯义勇骑兵团，毫无疑问。”","“Middlesex Corps, no doubt.”"
"“确实是这样。福尔摩斯先生，您简直跟巫师一样灵。”","“That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.”"
"看到他迷惑不解的表情，我不由得笑了起来。","I smiled at his bewildered expression."
"“一位英武的先生走进我的房间，脸上带着英国太阳晒不出的那种黝黑颜色，手帕又塞在袖子里，没有揣进口袋[^3]，看到这些情况，这位先生来自何方并不是一个很难推测的问题。短短的胡须说明您并不属于正规部队，您的仪态则表明了骑兵的身份。至于米德尔塞克斯嘛，您的名片写得明明白白，您在索格莫顿街做股票生意，既然如此，您当初加入的还能是哪个团呢？”[^4]","“When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a ridingman. As to Middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would you join?”"
"“什么都让您看见啦。”","“You see everything.”"
"“我看见的东西并不比您多，只不过我对自己进行过一番训练，能够确确实实地留意到自己看见的东西。好啦，多德先生，今早您来找我，肯定不是为了探讨观察的艺术。说吧，塔克斯伯里老庄园出了什么事呢？”","“I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park?”"
"“福尔摩斯先生——！”","“Mr. Holmes—!”"
"“亲爱的先生，这里面可没有什么玄虚啊。您那封信的抬头上就有这个地名，还有啊，您这么火急火燎地约我见面，显然是遇上了严重的突发事件。”","“My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred.”"
"“是的，确实是这样。可我的信是昨天下午写的，写完之后又发生了很多事情。如果埃姆斯沃思上校没把我撵出来的话——”","“Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out—”"
"“把您撵出来！”","“Kicked you out!”"
"“呃，事情确实发展到了这种地步。他硬得跟钉子似的，埃姆斯沃思上校就是这么个人。当年他就是陆军当中最厉害的老古板，他那个年代又不讲什么客气。要不是为了戈弗雷，我才不会去招惹他呢。”","“Well, that was what it amounted to. He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. I couldn’t have stuck the colonel if it had not been for Godfrey’s sake.”"
"我点起烟斗，往椅子背上一靠。","I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair."
"“麻烦您解释一下，您到底在说什么。”","“Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.”"
"我的主顾咧开嘴，顽皮地笑了笑。","My client grinned mischievously."
"“我已经习惯成自然，以为您什么都知道，用不着我来说了。”他说道。“好了，我这就把事情的经过告诉您，但愿您能告诉我，这到底是怎么回事。昨晚我没有睡觉，翻来覆去地想了一宿，越想越觉得莫名其妙。","“I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told,” said he. “But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. I’ve been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become."
"“一九○一年一月，也就是整整两年之前，我加入了年青的戈弗雷·埃姆斯沃思所在的那个中队。他是埃姆斯沃思上校的独子，上校在克里米亚战争当中赢得过维多利亚十字勋章[^5]。他身上流着战士的血液，参加义勇军也是理所当然的事情。我们那个团里再没有比他更出色的小伙子啦。我俩慢慢地有了交情，这样的交情只有同舟共济、同甘共苦的朋友才能有。他是我的伙伴，在军队当中，‘伙伴’可是个了不得的字眼。我俩打了一年的恶仗，是好是歹都在一起。后来呢，我们在比勒陀利亚外面的钻石山附近执行任务，敌人用猎象枪打中了他。他从开普敦的医院写了封信给我，又从南安普敦写了一封[^6]，再后来就一个字也没有了——一个字都没有，福尔摩斯先生，到现在已经大半年了，亏他还是我最好的伙伴呢。","“When I joined up in January , 1901—just two years ago— young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth’s only son—Emsworth, the Crimean V. C.—and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regiment. We formed a friendship—the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate—and that means a good deal in the Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from South Hampton. Since then not a word— not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal."
"“战争结束之后，我们都回了国。于是我写信给戈弗雷的父亲，跟他打听戈弗雷的下落，可他没有答复我。我等了一段时间，然后又写信去问。这一次倒是有了答复，只可惜又简短又生硬。他只是说戈弗雷坐船环游世界去了，一年之内都不会回来，别的就没有了。","“Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back fora year. That was all."
"“我可不能就此罢休，福尔摩斯先生，在我看来，整件事情都古怪得要命。戈弗雷是个好小伙儿，绝不会就这么扔下一个老朋友。他不会这么干的。再者说，我碰巧知道他是一大笔遗产的继承人，还知道他和他父亲并不总是那么合拍。老爷子有时候喜欢欺负人，年青的戈弗雷又是个暴脾气，不乐意逆来顺受。不成，我绝不能就此罢休，于是就决定把这件事情追查到底。不巧的是，我刚刚在国外待了两年，自个儿也有一大堆事情需要清理，所以呢，一直到这个星期，我才有工夫回头调查戈弗雷的事情。不过，既然我已经开始调查，那就一定会放下所有的事情，查清楚才能算数。”","“I wasn’t satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn’t satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years’ absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey’s case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.”"
"看样子，遇上了詹姆斯·M.多德先生这样的人，你最好是跟他交朋友，不要与他为敌。说话的时候，他那双蓝色的眼睛一瞬不瞬，方正的下巴也绷得紧紧的。","Mr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke."
"“那么，您是怎么调查的呢？”我问道。","“Well, what have you done?” I asked."
"“他的家是贝德福德[^7]附近的塔克斯伯里老庄园，我的第一步打算就是到那里去一趟，亲眼看看目前的形势。这么着，我给他母亲写了封信——因为我已经受够了他那个脾气乖戾的老父亲——直接发起了正面进攻：戈弗雷是我的好朋友，我很想跟她讲讲我俩的共同经历，我刚好要去附近的地方，能不能顺便拜访一下呢？如此等等。她给我回了一封相当亲切的信，还说我当晚可以住他们家。收到她的回信之后，我就在周一去了那里。","“My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother, therefore—I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father—and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. That was what took me down on Monday ."
"“塔克斯伯里老宅是个非常偏僻的所在，方圆五英里[^8]之内没有城镇。火车站没有马车可坐，所以我只好拎着箱子走路去，天快黑的时候才走到。这是座枝枝蔓蔓的大宅子，周围是一个巨大的庭园。按我看，这座宅子简直是历朝历代各种建筑风格拼成的一盘大杂烩，最老的是伊丽莎白式的砖木屋基，最新的则是维多利亚式的柱廊[^9]。宅子内部全都是镶板、挂毯和模糊褪色的古画，整个儿的气氛又阴沉又神秘。宅子里有个管家，名字叫做拉尔夫，岁数似乎跟宅子一样大，还有管家的老婆，岁数兴许比宅子还要大。她以前是戈弗雷的保姆，而我听戈弗雷说过，除了他母亲之外，就数这个保姆跟他最亲。所以呢，虽然她长得古怪，我还是对她产生了好感。他的母亲我也喜欢，她温和可亲，像只小白鼠似的。让我受不了的只有上校本人。","“Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible—five miles from anywhere. There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery . There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house, and there was his wife, who might have been older. She had been Godfrey’s nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The mother I liked also—a gentle little white mouse of a woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I barred."
"“刚一见面，我俩就吵了一架，当时我真想扭头就往车站走，转念一想，我要是这么做的话，没准儿会正中他的下怀哩。我到了之后，仆人直接把我领进了他的书房。他坐在他那张乱七八糟的写字台后面，身材高大，弯腰驼背，皮肤跟用烟熏过一样，花白的胡子乱作一团，红筋绽露的高鼻子好似鹰嘴，浓密的眉毛下面是一双凶巴巴的灰色眼睛，正在恶狠狠地瞪着我。戈弗雷很少说到他的父亲，这下我可知道原因在哪儿啦。","“We had a bit of barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. I was shown straight into his study , and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling gray beard, seated behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture’s beak, and two fierce gray eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father."
"“‘呃，先生，’他粗声粗气地说，‘我倒想问一问，你这次来的真正目的是什么。’","“ ‘Well, sir,’ said he in a rasping voice, ‘I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.’"
"“我告诉他，我已经在给他妻子的信里说明了来意。","“I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife."
"“‘是啊，是啊，你说你和戈弗雷是在非洲认识的。当然喽，这只是你自个儿的说法，并没有什么佐证。 ’ ","“ ‘Yes, yes, you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word for that.’"
"“‘我兜里还装着他写给我的信呢。’","“ ‘I have his letters to me in my pocket.’"
"“‘那就麻烦你给我看看吧。’","“ ‘Kindly let me see them.’"
"“我把那两封信递给了他，他大概扫了一眼，又把信扔给了我。","“He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back."
"“‘好吧，你想怎么样？’他问我。","“ ‘Well, what then?’ he asked."
"“‘我很喜欢您的儿子戈弗雷，先生。许许多多的纽带和回忆把我俩连在了一起。他突然断了音讯，所以我觉得很奇怪，想要知道他的下落，这不是很自然的吗？’","“ ‘I was fond of your son Godfrey , sir. Many ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?’"
"“‘我似乎记得，先生，我已经写过信给你，还把他的下落告诉了你。他坐船环游世界去了，因为他在非洲搞坏了身体，我和他妈妈都觉得他需要彻底地休养休养，换换环境。要是还有别的朋友问起这件事情的话，你就按我的话告诉他们好了。’","“ ‘I have some recollections, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. He has gone upon a voyage round the world. His health was in a poor way after his African experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.’"
"“‘没问题，’我这么回答。‘可我想请您告诉我，他坐的是哪艘船，走的是哪条航线，航程又是怎么安排的。依我看，我肯定能把信寄到他的手里。’","“ ‘Certainly ,’ I answered. ‘But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him.’"
"“听了我的请求，主人似乎又窘又怒，浓密的眉毛低低地压住了眼睛，手指则很不耐烦地敲打着桌子。到最后，他抬起眼睛看着我，神情活像是看到棋盘上的对手走出了一步杀着，并且已经想好了应手。","“My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. His great eyebrows came down over his eyes, and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it."
"“‘你这么没完没了，多德先生，’他说，‘肯定会让很多人生气上火，觉得你已经执拗到了无理取闹的程度。’ ","“ ‘Many people, Mr. Dodd,’ said he, ‘would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.’"
"“‘您一定得理解，先生，这只是因为我打心眼儿里喜欢您的儿子。’","“ ‘You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.’"
"“‘没错，就是因为这层考虑，我才对你一忍再忍。不过，我必须请你停止追问这些事情。家家都有自己的内情、自己的打算，并不总是方便告诉外人，哪怕是最善意的外人。我妻子很想听听戈弗雷过去的事情，你正好可以给她讲讲，可我想请你把现在和将来的事情撇在一边。打听这些事情不光是毫无益处，先生，还会让我们非常为难。’","“ ‘Exactly . I have already made every allowance upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however wellintentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey’s past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone. Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.’"
"“这样一来，福尔摩斯先生，我等于是一头撞进了死胡同，没办法再往下问了。我只好装出一副安于现状的样子，心里却暗暗发誓，不查清我朋友的下落绝不罢休。当晚的气氛十分惨淡，我和上校夫妻俩坐在一个阴沉古旧的房间里，无精打采地吃着晚饭。老夫人急切地向我打听儿子的事情，老爷子却显得闷闷不乐，沮丧不已。整个儿的过程没劲透了，以致我在礼节允许的范围之内早早地托词告退，回到了自个儿的房间里。他们把我安排在底楼，宽敞的房间空空荡荡，跟宅子里的其他地方一样阴沉，不过，福尔摩斯先生，要是在南非的大草原上住过一年的话，你也就不会太挑剔住处啦。我拉开窗帘，往花园里看了看，夜色晴朗，半个月亮明晃晃地挂在天上。这之后，我在呼呼作响的炉火旁边坐了下来，借着身旁的台灯读小说，拼命地想把自己的心思转移到小说里去。可是，老管家拉尔夫进来加炭，打断了我的阅读。","“So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend’s fate had been cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly , the three of us, in a gloomy faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one’s quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals."
"“‘我担心您房间里的炭烧不了一宿，先生。天气严寒，这些房间都冷得要命。’","“ ‘I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.’"
"“临走的时候，他有点儿犹犹豫豫，于是我转过头去，发现他面朝着我站在那里，满是皱纹的脸上带着一种愁肠百结的表情。","“He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face."
"“‘您多包涵，先生，可我不小心听到了您在晚餐桌上谈论戈弗雷少爷的事情。您得知道，先生，我妻子是他的保姆，所以呢，我可以算是他的养父。我俩都很关心他，这也是自然而然的事情。您说他表现得很不错，是这样吗，先生？’","“ ‘Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. It’s natural we should take an interest. And you say he carried himself well, sir?’"
"“‘团里再没有比他更勇敢的战士了。以前有一次，就是他把我从布尔人的枪口之下救了出来，要不然，我可就到不了这儿啦。’","“ ‘There was never a braver man in the regiment. He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.’"
"“老管家开始揉搓他那双皮包骨头的手。","“The old butler rubbed his skinny hands."
"“‘是啊，先生，是啊，戈弗雷少爷就是这个样子，总是充满了勇气。告诉您吧，先生，这园子里没有哪棵树他没上去过。他什么都不怕。他以前是个好小伙子——噢，先生，以前他可真是个好小伙子。’","“ ‘Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. He was always courageous. There’s not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing would stop him. He was a fine boy—and oh, sir, he was a fine man.’"
"“我一下子跳了起来。","“I sprang to my feet."
"“‘听着！’我大叫一声。‘你说他以前是个好小伙子，听上去就跟他已经死了一样。你们干吗要搞得这么神神秘秘？戈弗雷·埃姆斯沃思到底出了什么事情？’","“ ‘Look here!’ I cried. ‘You say he *was*. You speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery? What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?’"
"“我抓住老管家的肩膀，他闪身挣脱了我。","“I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away."
"“‘我听不懂您在说什么，先生。要知道戈弗雷少爷的事情，您就去问老爷吧。他知道这些事情，轮不到我来插手。’","“ ‘I don’t know what you mean, sir. Ask the master about Master Godfrey . He knows. It is not for me to interfere.’"
"“他打算往外走，可我抓住了他的胳膊。","“He was leaving the room, but I held his arm."
"“‘听着，’我说。‘出去之前，你一定得回答我最后一个问题，不然的话，我一整夜都不会松手。戈弗雷死了吗？’","“ ‘Listen,’ I said. ‘You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. Is Godfrey dead?’"
"“他不敢面对我的目光，看上去就跟中了催眠术一样。接下来，他千辛万苦地挤出了一个回答，一个出人意料的可怕回答。","“He could not face my eyes. He was like a man hypnotized.The answer was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one."
"“‘死了倒好！’他大叫一声，挣脱我的掌握，飞也似地冲出了房间。","“ ‘I wish to God he was!’ he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed from the room."
"“可想而知，福尔摩斯先生，坐回椅子上的时候，我的心情说不上特别地愉快。在我看来，老管家的话只能有一种含义。我那个倒霉的朋友显然是卷进了某种犯罪活动，退一万步说也是卷进了某种有损家声的可耻勾当。为了防止丑闻曝光，作风严厉的老爷子已经把儿子打发到了别处，不让他在社会上抛头露面。戈弗雷是个天不怕地不怕的家伙，很容易受身边众人的影响。毫无疑问，他一定是交友不慎，被人引上了身败名裂的歧途。真是那样的话，那可就太让人惋惜了。即便如此，我仍然有责任找到他，看看我能不能帮上他的忙。我正在心急火燎地盘算这件事情，无意中抬头一看，戈弗雷·埃姆斯沃思就站在我的眼前。”","“You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old man’s words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or, at the least, disreputable transaction which touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden himfrom the world lest some scandal should come to light. Godfrey was areckless fellow. He was easily influenced by those around him. No doubthe had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me.”"
"我的主顾突然打住了话头，看样子是激动得不行。","My client had paused as one in deep emotion."
"“接着讲吧。”我说道。“从某些方面来说，您这件案子还真是很不寻常哩。”","“Pray continue,” I said. “Your problem presents some very unusual features.”"
"“他站在窗子外面，福尔摩斯先生，还把脸贴在了窗玻璃上。刚才我跟您说了，当晚我曾经拉开窗帘往外看。看完之后，我并没有把窗帘拉严实。到这会儿，他的身影就出现在了窗帘的缝隙之中。窗子是落地式的，所以我可以看见他的全身，可我顾不上看别的，只知道直勾勾地盯着他的脸。他的脸白得跟死人一样，我从来没见过白成那样的人。依我看，只有鬼魂才会是那种模样，可他的眼睛迎上了我的眼睛，那双眼睛分明属于一个活着的人。他发现我正在看他，于是就往后一蹿，消失在了黑暗当中。","“He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly pale—never have Iseen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness."
"“他的样子着实让人惊骇，福尔摩斯先生。这不仅仅是因为他的脸在黑暗之中闪着奶酪一般的白光，看起来形同鬼魅，还因为他那种不易察觉的神色，那是一种偷偷摸摸、鬼鬼祟祟、做贼心虚的神色，跟我以前认识的那个坦率阳刚的小伙子大不相同。看到他如此模样，我觉得毛骨悚然。","“There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn’t merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that— something slinking, something furtive, something guilty— something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind."
"“不过，如果你当过一两年兵，成天都在跟布尔兄弟玩游戏，那你肯定能学会处变不惊，果断行事。这么着，戈弗雷的身影还没消失，我已经冲到了窗子跟前。窗闩很不灵便，我费了点儿工夫才把它弄开。接下来，我急匆匆地跑上花园里的小径，朝着我估计他逃走的方向追了过去。","“But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken."
"“小径很长，光线也不太好，可我还是隐约看到前面有东西在动。我边跑边喊他的名字，只可惜没有任何用处。小径的尽头出现了几条方向各不相同的岔路，分别通往庭园各处的几座小屋。我正在那里犹豫不决，耳边却清清楚楚地传来了关门的声音。声音不是来自我身后的宅子，而是来自前方的暗处。这声音足以让我断定，福尔摩斯先生，刚才我看见的并不是一个幻影。戈弗雷确实从我眼前逃了开去，并且跑进了某座小屋，关上了小屋的门。这些都是铁板钉钉的事实。","“It was a long path and the light was not very good, but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain."
"“我已经无计可施，只好转身回房，心神不宁地过了一夜，翻来覆去地掂量着这件事情，想找到一个足以涵盖所有事实的解释。到了第二天，我发现上校的态度好了许多。这一来，等他妻子提到附近有几处名胜的时候，我赶紧抓住机会问了一句，方不方便留我再住一宿。老爷子勉勉强强地表示默许，我由此赢得了一整天的时间，可以好好地观察观察。我已经确切地知道戈弗雷藏在附近，不知道的则是他具体藏在哪里，为什么要藏起来。","“There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. Next day I found the colonel rather more conciliatory , and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved."
"“他家的宅子大得要命，格局也乱得要命，就算藏了一个团的人也不会被人发现。秘密如果是藏在宅子里的话，打探起来自然是非常费劲。还好，我听见的关门声肯定不是从宅子里来的。如此说来，我必须把花园搜查一遍，看看能有什么样的发现。这方面倒没有什么障碍，因为老人家也有自个儿的事情要忙，我可以自行其是。","“The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. If the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. I must explore the garden and see what I could find. There was no difficulty in the way , for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices."
"“庭园里的几座屋子都很小，花园的尽头却有一座略具规模的独立建筑，大得可以充当花匠或者猎场看守的住所。难不成，关门的声音就是从这儿来的吗？我摆出一副在庭园里随意闲逛的架势，溜溜达达地走到了屋子跟前。就在这时，一个身材矮小、动作麻利的大胡子男人从屋里走了出来。他穿着一件黑色的大衣，戴着一顶圆顶礼帽，样子跟那些当花匠的完全不同。出乎我意料的是，他一出来就锁上了门，还把钥匙装进了衣兜。看到我的时候，他显得有点儿惊讶。","“There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size— large enough for a gardener’s or a gamekeeper’s residence. Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? I approached it in a careless fashion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat—not at all the gardener type—came out of the door. To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face."
"“‘您是这儿的客人吗？’他问我。“我告诉他，我确实是这儿的客人，同时告诉他，我还是戈弗雷的朋友。","“ ‘ Are you a visitor here?’ he asked."
"“‘真是不凑巧，他居然旅游去了，因为他肯定很想跟我见面。 ’我补充了一句。","“I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey’s."
"“‘是啊，确实不凑巧。’他的口气听着有点儿内疚。‘当然喽，您可以挑个更合适的时间再来一趟。’他从我身边走了过去，可是，等到我转过身去的时候，却发现他站在花园远端的月桂树丛里，探出了半个身子，正在观察我的动静。","“ ‘What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,’ I continued."
"“从那座小屋旁边走过的时候，我看得非常仔细，只可惜小屋拉着厚厚的窗帘，怎么看也只是一座空屋。表现得太过鲁莽的话，我没准儿会亲手毁掉自己的计划，甚至可能被他们扫地出门，因为我仍然感觉得到，有人在监视我的行动。想到这里，我溜达着走回了宅子，到晚上才再次展开调查。夜黑人静的时候，我从窗子溜了出去，径直奔向那座神秘的小屋，尽量不发出任何声音。","“ ‘Quite so. Exactly ,’ said he with a rather guilty air. ‘No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.’ He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden."
"“刚才我只是说小屋拉着厚厚的窗帘，眼下我才发现，它那些窗子还上着窗板。还好，有一扇窗子透着一点儿灯光，于是我一门心思地盯上了这扇窗子。算我走运，这扇窗子的窗帘没拉严实，窗板上又有一道裂缝，所以我可以看到屋里的情形。屋里的气氛相当欢快，灯光明亮，炉火熊熊。我早上见过的那个矮小男人坐在正对着我的位置，一边抽烟斗，一边阅读报刊。”","“I had a good look at that little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry . When all was dark and quiet I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge."
"“什么报刊？”我问道。","“I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter, so that I could see the inside of the room. It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper.”"
"我这么一打岔，我的主顾似乎不太高兴。","“What paper?” I asked. My client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative."
"“这有什么要紧的呢？”他问道。","“Can it matter?” he asked."
"“再要紧不过了。”","“It is most essential.”"
"“我真的没注意。”","“I really took no notice.”"
"“可您多半能注意到，它的开本是跟大报一样大，还是像周刊那么小。”","“Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies.”"
"“您这么一说，我倒是想起来了，他手里的报刊确实不大，兴许是《旁观者》杂志[^10]吧。话说回来，当时我真的顾不上研究这样的细节，因为屋里还有个背对窗子坐着的人，而我可以发誓，这个人就是戈弗雷。我虽然看不见他的脸，可我认得他肩膀倾斜的线条。他用一只手支着脑袋，一副痛心疾首的架势，身子则对着炉火。我正在琢磨接下来该怎么办，肩膀上就重重地挨了一下，转头一看，埃姆斯沃思上校已经站在了我的身旁。","“Now that you mention it, it was not large. It might have been the *Spectator*. However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy , his body turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me."
"“‘这边请，先生！’他低声说了一句。他一声不吭地走向宅子，我只好跟在后面，一直走进了我自个儿的卧室。他手里有一本列车时刻表，是他从大厅里拿来的。","“ ‘This way , sir!’ said he in a low voice. He walked in silence to the house, and I followed him into my own bedroom. He had picked up a timetable in the hall."
"“‘明早八点半有一班去伦敦的火车，’他说。‘八点钟的时候，马车会到门口来接你。’","“ ‘There is a train to London at 8:30,’ said he. ‘The trap will be at the door at eight.’"
"“他气得脸都白了，说实在的，我自个儿也觉得无地自容，只能结结巴巴地一边道歉，一边竭力强调，我这么做都是因为我担心朋友的安危。","“He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend."
"“‘这件事情没有商量的余地。’他突然打断了我。‘你这么刺探我们家的隐私，实在是可恶之极。你到我们这儿来作客，眼下却干起了间谍的勾当。我已经无话可说，先生，只剩下最后一句，我再也不想见到你。’","“ ‘The matter will not bear discussion,’ said he abruptly. ‘You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family . You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.’"
"“听了这句话，福尔摩斯先生，我一下子怒不可遏，言辞也变得激烈起来。","“At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth."
"“‘我已经看见了您的儿子，而我深信不疑，您不让他接触社会，完全是出于您自个儿的考虑。我虽然不知道您为什么要用这种方法来禁锢他，可我肯定他已经丧失了人身自由。我警告您，埃姆斯沃思上校，除非我确知我朋友平安无事，否则我绝不会半途而废，一定要把这件谜案查个水落石出！还有啊，我绝不会胆怯收手，不管您怎么说，怎么做。’","“ ‘I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.’"
"“老家伙露出了恶魔似的凶相，我真以为他打算跟我动手哩。我说过他是个瘦削凶暴的老巨人，所以呢，尽管我并不是什么弱不禁风的软蛋，对付他也不是那么容易。不过，他只是火冒三丈地瞪了我半天，最终还是转过身去，就这么走出了房间。我呢，今早就坐上了他指定的那班火车，一心只想着我在信里跟您约好的这次会面，想着要直接过来找您，寻求您的指教和帮助。”","“The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written.”"
"以上就是客人摆在我面前的问题。机敏的读者肯定已经发现，这个问题一点儿也不难，原因是可能的答案少之又少，稍加筛选就可以求得正解。话说回来，这个问题虽然简单之极，终归也包含着一些新奇有趣的特点，值得我把它记录下来。到这会儿，我便用上了我滚瓜烂熟的逻辑分析方法，开始对可能的答案进行筛选。","Such was the problem which my visitor laid before me. It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions."
"“宅子里的仆人，”我问道，“一共有几个呢？”","“The servants,” I asked; “how many were in the house?”"
"“据我所知是只有老管家夫妇二人。看情形，这家人的生活简单极了。 ”","“To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the simplest fashion.”"
"“如此说来，那座独立的屋子里并没有仆人喽？”","“There was no servant, then, in the detached house?”"
"“没有，除非那个身材矮小的大胡子扮演着仆人的角色。不过，他的地位似乎远在仆人之上。”","“None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person.”"
"“这似乎很能说明问题。您有没有看到过宅子里的人往小屋里送食物呢？”","“That seems very suggestive. Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?”"
"“您的问题倒是提醒了我，我确实看见过老拉尔夫顺着花园小径往小屋的方向走，手里还拎着一个篮子。只不过，当时我并没有往食物那方面想。”","“Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment.”"
"“您有没有找当地人打听打听呢？”","“Did you make any local inquiries?”"
"“有的，我打听过。我跟车站的站长聊过，还有村里的客栈老板。当时我直截了当地问他俩，知不知道我老战友戈弗雷·埃姆斯沃思的情况。他俩都信誓旦旦地告诉我，他坐船环游世界去了。他俩还说，他差不多是刚一回家就踏上了旅程。显而易见，大家都接受了上校的说法。”","“Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. The story was evidently universally accepted.”"
"“您没有跟他们说起您的怀疑吧？”","“You said nothing of your suspicions?”"
"“一个字儿也没说。”","“Nothing.”"
"“您做得非常明智。这件事情确实应该查一查，我打算跟您一起去塔克斯伯里老庄园。”","“That was very wise. The matter should certainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.”"
"“今天吗？”","“Today?”"
"不巧的是，当时我正在做一件案子的扫尾工作，那件案子就是我朋友华生写过的“修院学堂案”，跟格雷敏斯特公爵关联至深[^11]。除此之外，我还接下了土耳其苏丹委办的一件案子，必须立刻采取行动，否则就可能导致极其严重的政治后果。这样一来，按照我日记当中的记录，直到接下来这个星期刚刚开始的时候，我总算是腾出了空闲，可以跟詹姆斯·M.多德先生一起去料理贝德福德郡的这件案子。坐马车前往尤斯顿车站的途中，我们接上了一位面色铁青、神情严峻、沉默寡言的先生，因为我跟这位先生有约在先。","It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-gray aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements."
"“这位是我的老朋友。”我告诉多德。“我请他跟咱们一块儿去，有可能毫无必要，也有可能至关紧要。眼下这个阶段，咱们用不着细究这个问题。”","“This is an old friend,” said I to Dodd. “It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary , and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter.”"
"毫无疑问，华生的记述已经让读者们习惯了一个事实，也就是说，我绝不会为尚在权衡之中的案子浪费唇舌，也不会透露自己的想法。看到有人加入，多德似乎吃了一惊，不过他并没有说什么，我们三个便继续赶路。上了火车之后，我又问了多德一个问题，特意要让同行的这位先生听见。","The narratives of Watson, have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said, and the three of us continued our journey together. In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear."
"“按您的说法，当时您清清楚楚地看到您那位朋友的脸出现在了窗外，清楚得足以确定他的身份，对吗？”","“You say that you saw your friend’s face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?”"
"“这一点我有百分之百的把握。他的鼻子顶到了窗子玻璃，屋里的灯光直直地照亮了他的脸。”","“I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose was pressed against the glass. The lamplight shone full upon him.”"
"“不会是某个长得像他的人吗？”","“It could not have been someone resembling him?”"
"“不会，不会，就是他本人。”","“No, no, it was he.”"
"“可您不是说他样子变了吗？”","“But you say he was changed?”"
"“变了的只是脸色。他的脸——怎么说呢？——他的脸是鱼肚子的那种白色，就跟经过漂白一样。”","“Only in colour. His face was—how shall I describe it?—it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was bleached.”"
"“他的脸白得均匀吗？”","“Was it equally pale all over?”"
"“我的印象是不均匀。我看得最清楚的地方是他的额头，因为他的额头顶在了窗子上。”","“I think not. It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against  the window.”"
"“当时您叫他了吗？”","“Did you call to him?”"
"“当时我十分惊骇，所以就愣了一愣。我跟您说过的，接着我就跑去追他，只可惜没有追到。”","“I was too startled and horrified for the moment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result.”"
"问到这里，破案工作已经接近尾声，再添上一段小小的插曲，案子就算是水落石出。一段漫长的马车旅程之后，我们赶到了我主顾形容过的那座杂乱无章的奇特老宅，替我们开门的则是年迈的管家拉尔夫。马车是我全天包租的，这时我就请我那位年长的朋友继续待在车里，等我们叫他的时候再出来。拉尔夫是个满面皱纹的小老头，穿着一件黑色大衣和一条椒盐色长裤。他这身打扮非常保守，但却有一个古怪的例外，那便是他那双棕色的皮手套。他一看到我们就把手套摘了下来，又在我们进门的时候把它搁在了门厅的桌子上。你们兴许听我朋友华生说过，我拥有一套异常敏锐的感官，到这会儿，我便捕捉到了一缕浅淡却又刺鼻的气味。气味似乎来自门厅的桌子，于是我转过身去，把我的帽子往桌子上一放，又把帽子掀到地上，借着弯腰捡帽子的机会把鼻子凑到了离手套不到一英尺[^12]的地方。错不了，这股奇特的焦油气味的确来自管家的手套。这么着，走进书房的时候，我已经查清了全部的案情。唉，自己动手叙写案件的时候，我竟然不懂得遮遮掩掩，非要写得这么露骨！华生之所以能把结局写得那么哗众取宠，靠的不就是隐藏这一类的演绎环节嘛。","My case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. When, after considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall-table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my case complete. Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales."
"埃姆斯沃思上校不在房里，不过，收到拉尔夫的通报之后，他很快就赶了过来。过道里传来了他迅疾沉重的脚步声，跟着就见他推门冲进房间，须髯贲张，五官纠结，我这辈子再没见过比他更凶恶的老头。他举起我俩的名片，一撕两半，还用脚使劲儿地踩踏落到地上的碎片。","Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph’s message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments."
"“你这个该死的无事忙，我不是警告过你别再来了吗？你可千万别再让我在这儿看见你那张可恶的嘴脸。没有我的允许，你要是再上这儿来的话，那我就有权对你使用武力。我会请你吃枪子儿的，先生！老天作证，我一定会这么干！还有你，先生，”他转头冲着我，“同样的警告也适用于你。我知道你那份可耻的职业，可你只能到别处去显摆你那些据说很了不起的本事，我这里没有你发挥的余地。”","“Have I not told you, you infernal busybody , that you are warned off the premises? Never dare to show your damned face here again. If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. I’ll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir,” turning upon me, “I extend the same warning to you. I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. There is no opening for them here.”"
"“我不能走，”我的主顾斩钉截铁地说道，“除非戈弗雷亲口告诉我，他的自由没有受到限制。”","“I cannot leave here,” said my client firmly , “until I hear from Godfrey’s own lips that he is under no restraint.”"
"不乐意招待我们的主人摁响了唤人铃。","Our involuntary host rang the bell."
"“拉尔夫，”他说道，“打电话给郡里的警局，叫那个督察派两名警员过来，就说有窃贼闯进了我们的宅子。”","“Ralph,” he said, “telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the house.”"
"“等一等。”我说道。“您应该明白，多德先生，埃姆斯沃思上校有权报警，因为咱们无权进入他的住宅。另一方面，他也应该明白，您的举动完全是出于对他儿子的关心。以我愚见，如果能让我跟埃姆斯沃思上校谈五分钟的话，我肯定能改变他对这件事情的看法。”","“One moment,” said I. “You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. On the other hand, he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have five minutes’ conversation with Colonel Emsworth I could certainly alter his view of the matter.”"
"“我的看法没那么容易改变，”年迈的军人说道。“拉尔夫，照我的吩咐去办。你到底在等什么？赶紧去报警！”","“I am not so easily altered,” said the old soldier. “Ralph, do what I have told you. What the devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police!”"
"“那可不行。”我一边说，一边用背脊堵住了门。“警察一来，您担心的那种祸事就会变成现实。”我拿出自己的记事本，在一张散页上草草地写了一个词。“喏，”我把纸片递给了埃姆斯沃思上校，“我们就是为这个来的。”","“Nothing of the sort,” I said, putting my back to the door. “ Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread.” I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. “That,” said I as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, “is what has brought us here.”"
"他直勾勾地盯着我写的东西，满脸都是惊愕，再没有什么别的表情。","He stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished."
"“这你是怎么知道的呢？”他倒吸一口凉气，重重地坐进了椅子。","“How do you know?” he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair."
"“知道各种事情是我的本分，我就是干这个的。”","“It is my business to know things. That is my trade.”"
"他坐在那里沉思了一会儿，瘦骨嶙峋的手捻着蓬乱的胡须。这之后，他做了一个无可奈何的手势。","He sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of resignation."
"“呃，既然你们非要见戈弗雷，那就去见吧。这可不是我自个儿的意思，是你们逼我的。拉尔夫，你去通知一下戈弗雷先生和肯特先生，我们过五分钟就到。”","“Well, if you wish to see Godfrey , you shall. It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them.”"
"五分钟之后，我们已经顺着花园小径走到了小径尽头那座神秘小屋的门口。站在门口的是一个身材矮小的大胡子，脸上带着十分惊讶的表情。","At the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face."
"“这可真是太突然了，埃姆斯沃思上校。”他说道。“这一来，咱们的计划可就全泡汤啦。”","“This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,” said he. “This will disarrange all our plans.”"
"“我也是迫不得已，肯特先生，事情已经由不得咱们作主啦。戈弗雷先生能见我们吗？”","“I can’t help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us?”"
"“可以，他就在屋里等着呢。”他转过身去，把我们领进了一间陈设简朴的宽敞前屋。屋里有个男人，背对炉火站在那里。看到这个人，我的主顾立刻抢上前去，伸出了一只手。","“Yes, he is waiting inside.” He turned and led us into a large, plainly furnished front room. A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand."
"“咳，戈弗雷，老伙计，这可真是太好啦！”","“Why , Godfrey, old man, this is fine!”"
"对方却摆了摆手，不让我的主顾靠近。","But the other waved him back."
"“别碰我，吉米[^13]。你得跟我保持距离。是啊，难怪你看得目瞪口呆！我这副模样确实不太像 B中队那个英俊潇洒的埃姆斯沃思代理班长，对吧？”","“Don’t touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance. Yes, you may well stare! I don’t quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I?”"
"他的模样确实不比寻常。看得出来，以前他的确是个美男子，拥有一张轮廓分明的脸庞，外加非洲太阳赋予的黝黑肤色，眼下呢，一块块古怪的斑痕把他的皮肤涂成了白色，他的脸也变得斑斑驳驳。","His appearance was certainly extraordinary . One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin."
"“这就是我不肯见客的理由。 ”他说道。“我当然愿意见你，吉米，可我并不想见你这位朋友。我相信你这么做也是有原因的，可我还是觉得非常意外。”","“That’s why I don’t court visitors,” said he. “I don’t mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.”"
"“我只是想确定你平安无事，戈弗雷。那天晚上，我看见你在我窗子外面张望，所以就想把这件事情查清楚，要不然就没法安心啊。”","“I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up.”"
"“老拉尔夫跟我说你来了，所以我忍不住想偷偷地看你一眼。我本来以为你发现不了我，可我听见了你开窗子的声音，只好跑回了这个藏身的地洞。”","“Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn’t help taking a peep at you. I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up.”"
"“可是，老天在上，这到底是怎么回事呢？”","“But what in heaven’s name is the matter?”"
"“呃，几句话就可以说清楚。”他一边说，一边点上了一支香烟。“有一天早上，我们在比勒陀利亚外面的巴菲斯普鲁特[^14]打了一仗，就在往东的那条铁道上，这你肯定记得吧？当时我挨了一枪，你应该听说了吧？”","“Well, it’s not a long story to tell,” said he, lighting a cigarette. “You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on the Eastern railway line? You heard I was hit?”"
"“是的，我听说了，可我一直都不知道详细的情况。”","“Yes, I heard that, but I never got particulars.”"
"“当时我们跟其他人走散了，在一起的只有三个人。你肯定记得，那里的地形非常崎岖。跟我一起的有辛普森，就是绰号‘光头辛普森’的那个家伙，此外还有安德森。我们去那里清剿布尔兄弟，可他们躲在暗处，打得我们三个措手不及。他们两个都死了，我的肩膀也吃了一粒猎象枪子弹。还好，我拼死拼活地赖在了马背上，马儿狂奔了几英里之后，我终于失去知觉，滚鞍落马。","“Three of us got separated from the others. It was very broken country, you may remember. There was Simpson—the fellow we called Baldy Simpson—and Anderson, and I. We were clearing brother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. The other two were killed. I got an elephant bullet through my shoulder. I stuck on to my horse, however, and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off the saddle."
"“我醒过来的时候，天已经开始黑了。我挣扎着坐了起来，感觉非常虚弱，非常难受。出乎我意料的是，近旁就有一座相当大的房子，那房子带有一道宽阔的游廊，窗子也很多。天气冷得要命。你肯定记得，入夜的时候，那里的天气往往会冷得让人麻痹，那是一种让人晕眩的酷寒，跟清冷提神的霜冻完全不同。这么着，我觉得奇寒彻骨，看情形，只有躲进那座房子才有活路。我摇摇晃晃地站了起来，几乎是下意识地拖着自个儿的身体往前走。我隐约记得自己慢慢地爬上台阶，穿过大开的房门，走进一个摆着几张床的大房间，然后就欢呼一声，一头扑倒在其中的一张床上。那张床没有收拾过，可我一点儿也没觉得不妥。我用床单盖住瑟瑟发抖的身体，一转眼就睡熟了。","“When I came to myself it was nightfall, and I raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. To my surprise there was a house close beside me, a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows. It was deadly cold. You remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening, a deadly , sickening sort of cold, very different from a crisp healthy frost. Well, I was chilled to the bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house. I staggered to my feet and dragged myself along, hardly conscious of what I did. I have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them. It was unmade, but that troubled me not at all. I drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep."
"“我一觉睡到了第二天早上，然后就发现，我走进的并不是一个健康美好的世界，反倒是一场极其恐怖的梦魇。眼前是一个没有装饰的巨大房间，四壁刷得雪白，非洲的阳光从一扇扇没挂帘子的大窗子倾泻进来，把房间里的一切照得鲜明耀眼。站在我床前的是一个形同侏儒的矮小男人，顶着一颗圆鼓鼓的硕大脑袋，一边激动不已地用荷兰语唠叨着什么，一边挥舞他那双活像褐色海绵的可怕手掌。一群人站在他的身后，似乎是觉得眼前的情景有趣之极，我看到他们呢，感觉却是全身发冷。他们当中连一个健全的人也没有，全都是奇形怪状，有的歪七扭八，有的肿胀变形，还有的面目毁损。听着这些畸形怪物的笑声，实在是让人毛骨悚然。","“It was morning when I wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare. The out African sun flooded through the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear. In front of me was standing a small, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges. Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation, but a chill came over me as I looked at them. Not one of them was a normal human being. Every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way . The laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear."
"“这些人似乎都不会说英语，眼前的形势却必须赶紧澄清，因为大脑袋家伙越说越气，这会儿已经发出了野兽一般的怒吼，正在用他那双残损的手把我往床下拖，我的伤口又开始鲜血横流，可他不管不顾。这个小怪物壮得跟牛一样，幸亏有一位显然是主管人员的长者闻声赶来，如若不然，真不知道他会怎么折腾我呢。长者用荷兰语呵斥了几句，赶走了我的冤家对头，然后就转过身来，万分诧异地端详着我。","“It seemed that none of them could speak English, but the situation wanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry , and, uttering wild-beast cries, he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound. The little monster was as strong as a bull, and I don’t know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub. He said a few stern words in Dutch, and my persecutor shrank away . Then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement."
"“‘老天爷，你究竟是怎么跑到这里来的呢？’他惊讶地问了一句。‘别急着说话！我看你已经筋疲力尽，肩膀上的伤也需要处理一下。我是个医生，很快就可以帮你包扎好。可是，你这个人哪！对你来说，这儿可比战场危险得多呀。你眼下是在麻风病院里，睡的也是麻风病人的床啊。’","“ ‘How in the world did you come here?’ he asked in amazement. ‘Wait a bit! I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after. I am a doctor, and I’ll soon have you tied up. But, man alive! you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield. You are in the Leper Hospital, and you have slept in a leper’s bed.’"
"“后面的事情还用我说吗，吉米？情形似乎是这样的，我跑到那里的前一天，医院里的人眼看战火将临，就把那些可怜的家伙转移到了别的地方。等到英国军队开拔之后，医院的这位主管又把他们领了回来。主管郑重其事地告诉我，尽管他相信自己拥有抵抗麻风的免疫力，可他还是不敢像我这么干。他给我安排了一间单人病房，悉心地治疗我的枪伤，大概一个星期之后，我就转进了比勒陀利亚的普通医院。","“Need I tell you more, Jimmie? It seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before. Then, as the British advanced, they had been brought back by this, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he believed he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never have dared to do what I had done. He put me in a private room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria."
"“这就是我的惨痛经历。本来我还怀着一丝侥幸心理，可是，等我回到家里之后，你眼下看到的这些可怕斑痕终于出现在了我的脸上，让我知道自己在劫难逃。我该怎么办呢？我家的宅子非常偏僻，有两个绝对靠得住的仆人，还有一座可以供我居住的小屋。肯特先生是一位外科医生，他愿意照看我，并且发誓保守秘密。既然有这些条件，事情就显得非常简单。另一种选择只能说是可怕之极，它意味着我会遭到隔离，跟一些陌生人关在一起，一辈子也不会有获得释放的指望。可我们必须严守秘密，不然的话，即便是这样的宁静乡区也会闹得沸沸扬扬，而我就会被强行送进那个恐怖的深渊。就算在你面前，吉米——就算在你面前，我们也不敢吐露实情。这次我父亲为什么会让步，我是一点儿也不明白的。”","“So there you have my tragedy . I hoped against hope, but it was not until I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that I had not escaped. What was I to do? I was in this lonely house. We had two servants whom we could utterly trust. There was a house where I could live. Under pledge of secrecy , Mr. Kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me. It seemed simple enough on those lines. The alternative was a dreadful one—segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release. But absolute secrecy was necessary, or even in this quiet countryside there would have been an outcry , and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom. Even you, Jimmie—even you had to be kept in the dark. Why my father has relented I cannot imagine.”"
"埃姆斯沃思上校指向了我。","Colonel Emsworth pointed to me."
"“逼我让步的就是这位先生。”他展开了我刚才给他的那张纸片，纸片上写的正是“麻风”这个词。“我是这么想的，既然他已经知道了这么多，还是对他和盘托出比较安全。”","“This is the gentleman who forced my hand.” He unfolded the scrap of paper on which I had written the word “Leprosy .” “It seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all.”"
"“您想得没错，”我说道。“这样做没准儿还有好处哩，谁能说得准呢？照我看，诊治过这名病患的只有肯特先生一个人。据我所知，这一类的病症都来自热带或者亚热带地区，既然如此，先生，请允许我冒昧动问，您是这方面的权威人士吗？”","“And so it was,” said I. “Who knows but good may come of it? I understand that only Mr. Kent has seen the patient. May I ask, sir, if you are an authority on such complaints, which are, I understand, tropical or semi-tropical in their nature?”"
"“我是一名受过专业教育的医务人员，常识还是有的。”肯特先生如是回答，口气稍微有点儿生硬。","“I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man,” he observed with some stiffness."
"“先生，您拥有完备的专业资质，这一点我绝不怀疑，可我肯定您会赞成我的看法，也就是说，面对这样的病例，其他专家的意见也是值得听取的。依我看，您没有这么做，无非是担心别人逼迫您隔离病人而已。”","“I have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but I am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable. You have avoided this, I understand, for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient.”"
"“确实是这样。”埃姆斯沃思上校说道。","“That is so,” said Colonel Emsworth."
"“我预见到了这个难题，”我解释道，“所以就带来了一位朋友，他的审慎绝对值得你们的信任。我曾经为他提供过一次专业服务，因此他乐意抛开专家的身份，站在朋友的立场向你们提供建议。他就是詹姆斯·桑德斯爵士。”","“I foresaw this situation,” I explained, “and I have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted. I was able once to do him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist. His name is Sir James Saunders.”"
"听到这个名字，肯特先生露出了无比惊喜的表情，即便是一名刚刚入职的尉官获得了晋见罗伯茨勋爵[^15]的殊荣，惊喜之情也不会比他更甚。","The prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of Mr. Kent."
"“我真的觉得非常荣幸。”他喃喃说道。","“I shall indeed be proud,” he murmured."
"“那好，我马上请詹姆斯爵士过来，眼下他就在门外的那辆马车里面。他诊病的时候，埃姆斯沃思上校，咱们不妨去您的书房坐坐，我好向你们作一点儿必要的解释。”","“Then I will ask Sir James to step this way. He is at present in the carriage outside the door. Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps assemble in your study , where I could give the necessary explanations.”"
"写到这个地方，我才意识到华生对我是多么的重要。我的手艺非常简单，不过是一种系统化的常识，可他总是能通过恰到好处的提问和情不自禁的惊叹把它提升到人间奇迹的高度。轮到我自己叙写故事的时候，这样的帮助就没处找啦。没办法，我还是得把我的演绎过程讲出来，就按我当初的那种讲法，那时我坐在埃姆斯沃思上校的书房里，面对着有限的几名听众，其中也包括戈弗雷的母亲。","And here it is that I miss my Watson. By cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but systematized common sense, into a prodigy. When I tell my own story I have no such aid. And yet I will give my process of thought even as I gave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey’s mother in the study of Colonel Emsworth."
"“我这个演绎过程，”我说道，“立足点就是这样一条准则，也就是说，排除掉所有不可能的解释之后，剩下的解释就必然是事情的真相，不管它有多么匪夷所思。剩下的解释完全可能不只一种，这时你就得反复检验，直到其中的一种解释有了令人信服的佐证为止。好了，咱们不妨运用这条准则来分析眼前的案子。刚刚接到这件案子的时候，我看到了三种可能的解释，都可以说明这位先生为什么会在父亲的庄园小屋里隐居，或者是遭受禁锢。其一，他犯了罪，藏起来是为了逃避制裁；其二，他已经精神失常，家里人又不想把他送进精神病院；其三，他得了某种必须隔离的疾病。在我看来，除了这三种之外，其他的解释都不能自圆其说。接下来，我就得对这三种解释进行筛选和比较。","“That process,” said I, “starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. It may well be that several explanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support. We will now apply this principle to the case in point. As it was first presented to me, there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father’s mansion. There was the explanation, that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some disease which caused his segregation. I could think of no other adequate solutions. These, then, had to be sifted and balanced against each other."
"“负罪隐匿的解释完全经不起推敲。这个地区并没有呈报什么悬而未决的罪案，这一点我非常清楚。要是他犯了什么尚未暴露的罪行的话，符合家族利益的做法显然是送走这个不肖子，打发他去国外，而不是把他藏在家里。犯了罪又藏在家里，这样的举动我可解释不了。","“The criminal solution would not bear inspection. No unsolved crime had been reported from that district. I was sure of that. If it were some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home. I could see no explanation for such a line of conduct."
"“精神失常的解释倒显得比较合理。小屋里既然还有一个人，很可能就是他的看护。看护出门之后就把门锁上，不光为这种解释提供了又一个佐证，还让人联想到了‘禁锢’这个字眼儿。另一方面，小伙子遭受的禁锢应该不严，不然的话，他就不可能跑出来窥视他的朋友。您肯定还记得，多德先生，当时我鸡蛋里面挑骨头，问了您这样那样的问题，其中之一就是，肯特先生读的是什么报刊。要是他读的是《柳叶刀》或者《英国医学杂志》[^16]的话，兴许会对我有所帮助。话说回来，只要能请来合格的陪护人员，适时上报有关当局，把精神病人留在家里就不是一件违法的事情。既然如此，这家人干吗要像这样死守秘密呢？由此看来，这种解释也不符合事实。","“Insanity was more plausible. The presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper. The fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint. On the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend. You will remember, Mr. Dodd, that I felt round for points, asking you, for example, about the paper which Mr. Kent was reading. Had it been the *Lancet*or the *British Medical Journal*it would have helped me. It is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified. Why, then, all this desperate desire for secrecy? Once again I could not get the theory to fit the facts."
"“剩下的只有第三种解释，这种解释虽然离奇怪诞，看上去却可以涵盖所有的事实。麻风病在南非并不罕见，这个小伙子完全可能在某种非比寻常的状况之下受到感染。这样一来，他的亲人就会面临非常艰难的处境，因为他们肯定想帮助他逃脱隔离的厄运。他们必须严守秘密，不然的话，一旦流言四起，当局就会出手干预。只要酬劳适当，找个尽职尽责的医生看护并不是什么难事。天黑之后，他们完全可以允许病人自由活动，不需要有什么顾虑。除此之外，皮肤变白正是麻风病的常见症状。这种解释相当合理——应该说是十分合理，以致我决定据此采取行动，权当它是一个业已证实的结论。刚刚来到这里，我立刻打消了最后的一丝疑虑，因为我注意到，负责送饭的拉尔夫戴了一双浸过消毒水的手套。然后呢，先生，只用了一个词，我就让您认清了秘密曝光的事实，而我之所以要用字条代替言语，正是为了向您表明，我的审慎值得您的信任。”","“There remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely asit was, everything seemed to fit. Leprosy is not uncommon in SouthAfrica. By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it. His people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they would desire to save him from segregation. Great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities. A devoted medical man, if sufficiently paid, would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer. There would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark. Bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease. The case was a strong one—so strong that I determined to act as if it were actually proved. When on arriving here I noticed that Ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants, my last doubts were removed. A single word showed you, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if I wrote rather than said it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted.”"
"我这段小小分析接近尾声的时候，书房的门开了，仆人把那位庄严肃穆的皮肤病权威领了进来。不过，就这么一次，爵士那副高深莫测的刻板面容有所缓和，眼睛里也有了一丝温情脉脉的暖意。他大步走到埃姆斯沃思上校面前，跟上校握了握手。","I was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in. But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes. He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook him by the hand."
"“我通常都只能跟人报忧，很少能有报喜的份儿。”他如是说道。“这一次我赶上的是比较称心的那种情形。他得的不是麻风。”","“It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings and seldom good,” said he. “This occasion is the more welcome. It is not leprosy.”"
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“他得的是典型的假麻风，又叫鱼鳞癣。患者的皮肤会出现状如鱼鳞的病变，影响美观，十分顽固，不过，治愈还是有可能的，传染则是绝无可能。没错，福尔摩斯先生，这件事情确实是巧得出奇。可是，这真的只是一种巧合吗？会不会，这里面有一些我们知之甚少的力量在起作用呢？接触到传染源之后，这个小伙子肯定是寝食难安，谁又敢打包票，不是他的恐惧导致他的身体发生变化，模拟了他所恐惧的那种疾病呢？不管怎么样，我敢拿我的职业声誉来担保——不好，老夫人晕过去了！依我看，肯特先生，您最好守在她的身边，等着她从这次惊喜休克当中恢复过来吧。”","“ A well-marked case of pseudoleprosy or ichthyosis, a scale-like affection of the skin, unsightly , obstinate, but possibly curable, and certainly noninfective. Yes, Mr. Holmes, the coincidence is a remarkable one. But is it coincidence? Are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little? Are we assured that the apprehension from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears? At any rate, I pledge my professional reputation—But the lady has fainted! I think that Mr. Kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock.”"
