"沙漠里的爱情","A Passion in the Desert"
"沙漠里的爱情","A Passion In The Desert"
"作者：巴尔扎克","by Honore de Balzac"
"“整场表演太恐怖了！”她喊着，走出了马丁先生的动物展览馆。她刚才一直在观看那个大胆的艺人——用广告上的话说——就是“与鬣狗共舞”。","“The whole show is dreadful,” she cried coming out of the menagerie of M. Martin.She had just been looking at that daring speculator “working with his hyena,”—to speak in the style of the programme."
"“他用什么方法，”她继续说，“竟能把这些动物驯化得这么好，都能懂得它们的感情了——”","“By what means,” she continued, “can he have tamed these animals to such a point as to be certain of their affection for—”"
"“你觉得奇怪的东西，”我打断她的话说，“其实再自然不过了。”","“What seems to you a problem,” said I, interrupting, “is really quite natural.”"
"“哦！”她喊道，嘴上露出不以为然的笑容。","“Oh!” she cried, letting an incredulous smile wander over her lips."
"“你以为野兽是完全没有情感的吗？”我问她。","“You think that beasts are wholly without passions?” I asked her."
"“恰恰相反，我们可以把我们自己文明形态中所有的恶习教给它们。”","“Quite the reverse; we can communicate to them all the vices arising in our own state of civilization.”"
"她惊讶地看着我。","She looked at me with an air of astonishment."
"“但是，”我继续说，“我承认，第一次看到马丁先生的演出时，我和你一样惊讶地大喊了起来。当时，我发现坐在我身旁的是一位和我一起入场的老兵，他的右腿已经截肢了。他的脸给我留下了很深的印象。他像许许多多的英雄一样，长着这样的脑袋：上面烙着战役的痕迹，也留着拿破仑历次战役的记录。而且，他性格直爽、开朗，这种性格总会给我留下良好的印象。他无疑是那种无所畏惧的士兵，什么事都不会令他惊奇，从同伴临死前的惨状中都能找到笑料。他会很高兴地掩埋同伴的尸体、脱掉同伴的衣服。即使是在枪林弹雨中，他也毫不畏惧。事实上，他做事从不三思，会不假思索地与魔鬼做朋友。动物展览馆的老板从兽房中走了出来，我的同伴对他仔细打量了一番后，就撅起嘴唇，面部极具表现力地扭曲着，显出一丝蔑视和嘲讽的神情。只有高人一等者才会这样意味深长地撅着嘴，说明自己没有上当。所以，当我滔滔不绝地谈论马丁先生是如何有勇气的时候，他一边笑着，一边知情一般地摇着头，说道：‘不稀奇。’","“But,” I continued, “the first time I saw M. Martin, I admit, like you, I did give vent to an exclamation of surprise.I found myself next to an old soldier with the right leg amputated, who had come in with me.His face had struck me.He had one of those heroic heads, stamped with the seal of warfare, and on which the battles of Napoleon are written.Besides, he had that frank, good-humored expression which always impresses me favorably.He was without doubt one of those troopers who are surprised at nothing, who find matter for laughter in the contortions of a dying comrade, who bury or plunder him quite light-heartedly, who stand intrepidly in the way of bullets;—in fact, one of those men who waste no time in deliberation, and would not hesitate to make friends with the devil himself.After looking very attentively at the proprietor of the menagerie getting out of his box, my companion pursed up his lips with an air of mockery and contempt, with that peculiar and expressive twist which superior people assume to show they are not taken in.Then, when I was expatiating on the courage of M. Martin, he smiled, shook his head knowingly, and said,‘Well known.’"
"‘为什么“不稀奇”？’我问道，‘如果你把这个秘密告诉我，我会感激不尽。’","‘How “well known”?’ I said.‘If you would only explain me the mystery, I should be vastly obliged.’"
"“几分钟后，我们就很熟了，之后就一起走进了第一个引起我们注意的餐馆。吃甜食的时候，他喝了一瓶香槟酒，这让他的头脑完全清晰起来，并勾起了对这个古怪老兵的回忆。他向我讲述了他的故事，我明白了当他喊出‘不稀奇’的时候，他是有理由的。”","“After a few minutes, during which we made acquaintance, we went to dine at the first restauranteur’s whose shop caught our eye.At dessert a bottle of champagne completely refreshed and brightened up the memories of this odd old soldier.He told me his story, and I saw that he was right when he exclaimed, ‘Well known.’”"
"回家后，她就一直挑逗我，这实在太有魅力，而且她还承诺了我很多事，我只好答应把那个老士兵的秘密告诉她。第二天她就收到了下面这篇文章，这只是一部史诗中的一段插曲，我们可以将其命名为《法国人在埃及》。","When she got home, she teased me to that extent, was so charming, and made so many promises, that I consented to communicate to her the confidences of the old soldier.Next day she received the following episode of an epic which one might call “The French in Egypt.”"
"故事是这样的：在德塞将军率部远征上埃及时，一个来自普罗旺斯的士兵落入了马格里布人的手中，被这些阿拉伯人带到远离尼罗河瀑布的一处沙漠里。","During the expedition in Upper Egypt under General Desaix, a Provencal soldier fell into the hands of the Maugrabins, and was taken by these Arabs into the deserts beyond the falls of the Nile."
"马格里布人为了与法国军队拉开足够的距离，一路强行军，只有到了夜里才休息。他们在一口被几棵棕榈树掩映的水井周围扎营，树下埋藏着许多他们事先准备好的食物。他们没有想到那个俘虏会产生逃跑的念头，认为绑住他的双手就没事了。于是，他们吃了些枣，给马喂了些粮草后，就睡下了。","In order to place a sufficient distance between themselves and the French army, the Maugrabins made forced marches, and only halted when night was upon them.They camped round a well overshadowed by palm trees under which they had previously concealed a store of provisions.Not surmising that the notion of flight would occur to their prisoner, they contented themselves with binding his hands, and after eating a few dates, and giving provender to their horses, went to sleep."
"勇敢的普罗旺斯人见敌人不再监视他了，就用牙齿偷偷地衔起一把弯刀，用双膝夹住刀刃，切断绑住双手的绳索，立刻就重获自由了。他迅速抓起一支步枪和一把匕首。为了以防万一，他又拿了一袋干枣、一些燕麦、一些火药和子弹。他在腰间系了一把弯刀，跳上一匹马，就朝着他认为能找到法国军队的方向飞奔而去。他回营的心情十分急切，拼命催促早已疲惫不堪的马。最后，可怜的牲畜被他的靴刺扎得两肋俱裂，一命呜呼了，将法国人一人留在了沙漠之中。作为一个逃犯，士兵拿出了所有的勇气。在沙漠里步行一段时间后，他不得不停下，因为天已经黑了。尽管东方的夜空很美，但是他感觉自己再也没有力量继续前进了。幸运的是，他发现了一个小山丘，山丘的顶上长着几棵直冲云霄的棕榈树。远远看去，一片翠绿，这给他的心灵带来了希望和安慰。他太累了，立马躺在了一块形状怪异、很像行军床的花岗岩上。他没有采取任何预防措施来保卫自己，就酣然入睡了。他已经把生命都赌上了。他最后的想法就是后悔。他后悔自己离开那些马格里布人，那些人的游牧生活仿佛正在向他微笑，但他现在离他们那么遥远，得不到一点帮助。他被太阳晒醒，无情的日光强烈地直射在花岗岩上，热得让人难以忍受——他本应该睡在棕榈树那翠绿、高昂的树冠投下的浓密阴影里，但是他睡的方向反了。他望着这些孤零零的树，身体发起抖来——这些树让他回忆起了阿尔勒的大教堂中那优美的柱子。这些柱子顶部装饰着叶子，带着萨拉森圆柱的特色。","When the brave Provencal saw that his enemies were no longer watching him, he made use of his teeth to steal a scimiter, fixed the blade between his knees, and cut the cords which prevented him from using his hands; in a moment he was free.He at once seized a rifle and a dagger, then taking the precautions to provide himself with a sack of dried dates, oats, and powder and shot, and to fasten a scimiter to his waist, he leaped on to a horse, and spurred on vigorously in the direction where he thought to find the French army.So impatient was he to see a bivouac again that he pressed on the already tired courser at such speed, that its flanks were lacerated with his spurs, and at last the poor animal died, leaving the Frenchman alone in the desert.After walking some time in the sand with all the courage of an escaped convict, the soldier was obliged to stop, as the day had already ended.In spite of the beauty of an Oriental sky at night, he felt he had not strength enough to go on.Fortunately he had been able to find a small hill, on the summit of which a few palm trees shot up into the air; it was their verdure seen from afar which had brought hope and consolation to his heart.His fatigue was so great that he lay down upon a rock of granite, capriciously cut out like a camp-bed; there he fell asleep without taking any precaution to defend himself while he slept.He had made the sacrifice of his life.His last thought was one of regret.He repented having left the Maugrabins, whose nomadic life seemed to smile upon him now that he was far from them and without help.He was awakened by the sun, whose pitiless rays fell with all their force on the granite and produced an intolerable heat—for he had had the stupidity to place himself adversely to the shadow thrown by the verdant majestic heads of the palm trees.He looked at the solitary trees and shuddered—they reminded him of the graceful shafts crowned with foliage which characterize the Saracen columns in the cathedral of Arles."
"但是，数完这些棕榈树后，他环顾四周，最恐怖的绝望便袭上心头。他面前的景象有如一望无际的大海。沙漠中深灰色的沙子伸向四面八方，目不可及，在强烈的阳光的照射下，像钢铁那样熠熠生辉。这也许是一片镜子的海洋，或是由许多湖泊融成的一面镜子。火热的蒸汽如巨浪般袭来，在颤动的土地上方不停地旋转。天空具有东方特有的光辉，洁净得让人无法忍受，不给人留下丝毫想象的空间。天空和大地都在燃烧。","But when, after counting the palm trees, he cast his eyes around him, the most horrible despair was infused into his soul.Before him stretched an ocean without limit.The dark sand of the desert spread further than eye could reach in every direction, and glittered like steel struck with bright light.It might have been a sea of looking-glass, or lakes melted together in a mirror.A fiery vapor carried up in surging waves made a perpetual whirlwind over the quivering land.The sky was lit with an Oriental splendor of insupportable purity, leaving naught for the imagination to desire.Heaven and earth were on fire."
"寂静显出野蛮和可怕的威严，让人不寒而栗。苍茫辽阔、无边无垠的世界从四面八方压迫着他的心灵。天空里没有一片云彩，空气里没有一丝微风，沙海上没有一点瑕疵，一切都纹丝不动，没有在沙海上掀起一丝波浪；就像在晴朗的海上一样，他视野的尽头是一道亮光，极为平整，像刀切过一般。","The silence was awful in its wild and terrible majesty.Infinity, immensity, closed in upon the soul from every side.Not a cloud in the sky, not a breath in the air, not a flaw on the bosom of the sand, ever moving in diminutive waves; the horizon ended as at sea on a clear day, with one line of light, definite as the cut of a sword."
"普罗旺斯人伸手抱住一棵棕榈树的树干，就像抱着一个朋友的身体那样。然后，他站在这棵棕榈树投射在花岗岩上的纤细、笔直的阴影下，哭泣起来。他原地坐下，满怀忧伤地望着眼前这片无情的景象，这一切都是他不得不面对的。他放声大喊，好像是在测量这里有多么荒凉。他的声音消失在沙山的凹陷处，听起来十分微弱，没有丝毫的回声——回声在他自己心中。这个普罗旺斯人二十二岁了——他把卡宾枪装上了子弹。","The Provencal threw his arms round the trunk of one of the palm trees, as though it were the body of a friend, and then, in the shelter of the thin, straight shadow that the palm cast upon the granite, he wept.Then sitting down he remained as he was, contemplating with profound sadness the implacable scene, which was all he had to look upon.He cried aloud, to measure the solitude.His voice, lost in the hollows of the hill, sounded faintly, and aroused no echo—the echo was in his own heart.The Provencal was twenty-two years old:—he loaded his carbine."
"“时间会有的。”他自言自语道，放下了能让他得到解脱的武器。","“There’ll be time enough,” he said to himself, laying on the ground the weapon which alone could bring him deliverance."
"士兵一会儿望望深灰色的、辽阔的沙漠，一会儿看看蔚蓝色的、宽广的天空，他想起了法国——他欣喜地闻到了巴黎水沟的气味——他想起了他曾经穿过的城市，回忆起了同伴的脸庞，也记起了生活中最琐碎的事情。很快，他用南方人的想象力，透过广阔无垠的沙漠上空起伏的热气，看到了他亲爱的普罗旺斯的石头。他意识到这些让人伤心的幻想是很危险的，就从山的一边走下去——他昨天是从另一边上来的。这里有片避难所，洞穴里留有地毯的痕迹，这表明有人曾经在这里住过；他看见不远处有几棵挂满枣的棕榈树。于是，人类求生的本能在他心中再次苏醒。他希望自己能够活得足够长，可以看到马格里布人经过此地，或许他能够听到大炮的声音，因为此时此刻，波拿巴正在横越埃及。","Viewing alternately the dark expanse of the desert and the blue expanse of the sky, the soldier dreamed of France—he smelled with delight the gutters of Paris—he remembered the towns through which he had passed, the faces of his comrades, the most minute details of his life.His Southern fancy soon showed him the stones of his beloved Provence, in the play of the heat which undulated above the wide expanse of the desert.Realizing the danger of this cruel mirage, he went down the opposite side of the hill to that by which he had come up the day before.The remains of a rug showed that this place of refuge had at one time been inhabited; at a short distance he saw some palm trees full of dates.Then the instinct which binds us to life awoke again in his heart.He hoped to live long enough to await the passing of some Maugrabins, or perhaps he might hear the sound of cannon; for at this time Bonaparte was traversing Egypt."
"这个想法让他获得了新生。这棕榈树似乎被成熟果实的重量压得有些弯曲了。他摇了一些果实下来。他尝了尝这意想不到的吗哪(《圣经》故事所述,古以色列人经过荒野所得的天赐食物)，他确信这几棵树是以前居住在这里的人栽培的——甜美、新鲜的果肉证明了栽培者的悉心照料。他一下子从极度绝望转为近乎疯狂的喜悦。他再次爬上山顶，把白天剩下的时间都花在砍一棵不结果实的棕榈树上，昨天他还在这树的树阴下睡了一晚。他模模糊糊地想起了沙漠中的动物。岩石下有泉水涌出，接着消失在远处。为了防止动物来泉边喝水，他决定在隐居的洞穴的入口处设置一道栅栏来自卫。","This thought gave him new life.The palm tree seemed to bend with the weight of the ripe fruit.He shook some of it down.When he tasted this unhoped-for manna, he felt sure that the palms had been cultivated by a former inhabitant—the savory, fresh meat of the dates were proof of the care of his predecessor.He passed suddenly from dark despair to an almost insane joy.He went up again to the top of the hill, and spent the rest of the day in cutting down one of the sterile palm trees, which the night before had served him for shelter.A vague memory made him think of the animals of the desert; and in case they might come to drink at the spring, visible from the base of the rocks but lost further down, he resolved to guard himself from their visits by placing a barrier at the entrance of his hermitage."
"尽管他十分努力，又因为担心在睡梦中被动物吞食而有了动力，但他只是把棕榈树砍倒了，没能把它砍成木片。这棵“沙漠之王”在黄昏时候倒下了，倒下时的声响四处回荡，就像是荒僻之地的一声叹息。士兵哆嗦了一下，似乎听到了某种声音在向他预示灾难的来临。","In spite of his diligence, and the strength which the fear of being devoured asleep gave him, he was unable to cut the palm in pieces, though he succeeded in cutting it down.At eventide the king of the desert fell; the sound of its fall resounded far and wide, like a sigh in the solitude; the soldier shuddered as though he had heard some voice predicting woe."
"但是，就像一个继承人不会长久地为一个死去的亲戚痛哭那样，他从这棵美丽的树上砍下了一些又长又宽的绿叶——这些树叶是棕榈树富有诗意的装饰品——他用这些叶子来修补席子，准备睡在上面。","But like an heir who does not long bewail a deceased relative, he tore off from this beautiful tree the tall broad green leaves which are its poetic adornment, and used them to mend the mat on which he was to sleep."
"炙热的天气和劳作让他十分疲惫，他很快就在潮湿的洞穴里的红色石壁下睡着了。","Fatigued by the heat and his work, he fell asleep under the red curtains of his wet cave."
"半夜时分，他被一种奇怪的声音吵醒。他坐了起来。在周围的死寂中，他能够听到一起一伏的呼吸声，人类的呼吸不可能散发出如此凶悍的力量。","In the middle of the night his sleep was troubled by an extraordinary noise; he sat up, and the deep silence around allowed him to distinguish the alternative accents of a respiration whose savage energy could not belong to a human creature."
"黑暗、寂静和他惊醒时的幻觉加深了他极度的恐惧，让他的心像结了冰一样。他竭力睁大眼睛，透过阴影看到了两束微弱的黄光。这让他感到头发都竖起来了。起初，他还以为这些光是自己瞳孔的反光。但是，借着明亮的夜光，他慢慢地分辨出了洞穴中环绕他周围的物体，看到了一只庞大的动物躺在他仅仅两步远的地方。它是狮子、老虎，还是鳄鱼？","A profound terror, increased still further by the darkness, the silence, and his waking images, froze his heart within him.He almost felt his hair stand on end, when by straining his eyes to their utmost he perceived through the shadow two faint yellow lights.At first he attributed these lights to the reflections of his own pupils, but soon the vivid brilliance of the night aided him gradually to distinguish the objects around him in the cave, and he beheld a huge animal lying but two steps from him.Was it a lion, a tiger, or a crocodile?"
"这个普罗旺斯人接受过的教育不够让他明白他的敌人属于哪个物种。但是他此时更多地感到的是恐惧，因为他的无知让他脑海里一下子充满了各种恐惧。他忍受着残酷的折磨，注意着附近那呼吸的每一次起伏，一动都不敢动。一种刺鼻的气味充满了整个洞穴，这气味像是狐狸的气味，却要更为刺鼻、更为浓厚一些。当普罗旺斯人意识到这一点，他的恐惧变得无以复加。因为他不用再怀疑身边是否有只可怕的伙伴，而他却在它的“王宫”里避难。","The Provencal was not sufficiently educated to know under what species his enemy ought to be classed; but his fright was all the greater, as his ignorance led him to imagine all terrors at once; he endured a cruel torture, noting every variation of the breathing close to him without daring to make the slightest movement.An odor, pungent like that of a fox, but more penetrating, more profound,—so to speak,—filled the cave, and when the Provencal became sensible of this, his terror reached its height, for he could no longer doubt the proximity of a terrible companion, whose royal dwelling served him for a shelter."
"不一会儿，正在向地平线缓缓下沉的月亮的光芒照亮了兽穴，一只豹子那长满花斑的、华丽的皮毛渐渐显露出来。","Presently the reflection of the moon descending on the horizon lit up the den, rendering gradually visible and resplendent the spotted skin of a panther."
"这只埃及的“雄狮”睡着了，宛如一只在大公馆门口的豪华狗舍里安详地蜷缩着的大狗。它的眼睛忽而睁开，忽而闭上，脸朝着法国人。法国人的脑袋里闪过千百种混乱的想法。最初，他想一枪打死它。可是他发现自己与目标的距离不够，子弹会脱靶。而且，要是它醒了怎么办！一想到这儿，他四肢都僵硬了。他在寂静中倾听自己心跳的声音，咒骂自己的血流让自己的脉搏跳得太猛烈，怕万一把这畜生吵醒，就没有时间思考逃跑的办法了。","This lion of Egypt slept, curled up like a big dog, the peaceful possessor of a sumptuous niche at the gate of a hotel; its eyes opened for a moment and closed again; its face was turned towards the man.A thousand confused thoughts passed through the Frenchman’s mind; first he thought of killing it with a bullet from his gun, but he saw there was not enough distance between them for him to take proper aim—the shot would miss the mark.And if it were to wake!—the thought made his limbs rigid.He listened to his own heart beating in the midst of the silence, and cursed the too violent pulsations which the flow of blood brought on, fearing to disturb that sleep which allowed him time to think of some means of escape."
"他两次把手按在弯刀上，想砍下敌人的头。但是，那硬邦邦的短毛很难砍透，他不得不放弃这个大胆的计划。砍歪就无异于死亡，他这样想到。他更喜欢在公平拼搏时捕捉机会。于是，他下定决心一直等到天亮。他没等多久，天就亮了。","Twice he placed his hand on his scimiter, intending to cut off the head of his enemy; but the difficulty of cutting the stiff short hair compelled him to abandon this daring project.To miss would be to die for CERTAIN, he thought; he preferred the chances of fair fight, and made up his mind to wait till morning; the morning did not leave him long to wait."
"他现在可以好好打量这个豹子了：它的鼻口还留着血迹。","He could now examine the panther at ease; its muzzle was smeared with blood."
"“她吃了一顿美餐。”他想，完全没有想她是不是饱享了一顿人肉大餐。“她起来的时候就不会饿了。”","“She’s had a good dinner,” he thought, without troubling himself as to whether her feast might have been on human flesh.“She won’t be hungry when she gets up.”"
"这是一只母豹。她肚子和两侧的毛发闪着白光；很多天鹅绒般的小斑点绕在她脚上，像漂亮的镯子一样；她弯弯的尾巴也是白色的，尾梢带有几个黑环；她背部的皮毛像铮亮的黄金，轻盈而柔软，上面点缀着特有的玫瑰状斑点——这正是豹子与其他猫科动物的区别所在。","It was a female.The fur on her belly and flanks was glistening white; many small marks like velvet formed beautiful bracelets round her feet; her sinuous tail was also white, ending with black rings; the overpart of her dress, yellow like burnished gold, very lissome and soft, had the characteristic blotches in the form of rosettes, which distinguish the panther from every other feline species."
"这位安详却又强大的女主人打着呼噜，姿态像一只躺在坐垫上的猫一般优雅。她沾满血迹的爪子强健有力、装备精良，伸在她的头前面。她的头搭在爪上，几根笔直的长须像银丝一样从面部发散出来。","This tranquil and formidable hostess snored in an attitude as graceful as that of a cat lying on a cushion.Her blood-stained paws, nervous and well armed, were stretched out before her face, which rested upon them, and from which radiated her straight slender whiskers, like threads of silver."
"如果这豹子是在笼子里，普罗旺斯人无疑会欣赏她的优雅，羡慕她身上对比明显的鲜亮色彩，这些颜色使她的长袍拥有皇族的华丽。可是，当时他只看得到她凶恶的外表。","If she had been like that in a cage, the Provencal would doubtless have admired the grace of the animal, and the vigorous contrasts of vivid color which gave her robe an imperial splendor; but just then his sight was troubled by her sinister appearance."
"虽然这只豹子正在沉睡，但她的存在对他的影响就像传说中毒蛇的眼睛对夜莺产生的效果一样。","The presence of the panther, even asleep, could not fail to produce the effect which the magnetic eyes of the serpent are said to have on the nightingale."
"面临这样的危险，士兵一度丧失了勇气。虽然在上了膛的炮口前，他一定会充满勇气。然而，一个大胆的想法给他的内心带来了一丝光亮，堵住了恐惧之源，让他额头上不再冒冷汗了。人在走投无路的时候，往往会藐视死亡，与对方同归于尽，他就是这样。他将所有的一切仅看作是一场悲剧，决心演好自己的角色，体面地演完这出戏。","For a moment the courage of the soldier began to fail before this danger, though no doubt it would have risen at the mouth of a cannon charged with shell.Nevertheless, a bold thought brought daylight to his soul and sealed up the source of the cold sweat which sprang forth on his brow.Like men driven to bay, who defy death and offer their body to the smiter, so he, seeing in this merely a tragic episode, resolved to play his part with honor to the last."
"“也许前天阿拉伯人应该把我杀了。”他说道，把自己视作已经死去的人。因此，他内心满怀好奇，勇敢地等待着敌人的醒来。","“The day before yesterday the Arabs would have killed me, perhaps,” he said; so considering himself as good as dead already, he waited bravely, with excited curiosity, the awakening of his enemy."
"当太阳升起，豹子突然睁开了眼睛。接着，她用力地伸开爪子，似乎要舒筋活骨。最后，她打了一个哈欠，露出那令人畏惧的牙齿和那尖锐的、锉刀般粗糙的舌头。","When the sun appeared, the panther suddenly opened her eyes; then she put out her paws with energy, as if to stretch them and get rid of cramp.At last she yawned, showing the formidable apparatus of her teeth and pointed tongue, rough as a file."
"法国人看着她温柔而娇媚地打滚，想道：“简直是个娇小的情妇。”她舔去粘在爪子和鼻口上的血迹，反复地挠着脑袋，动作很优美。“好把，稍微梳洗一下。”法国人自言自语道，他心情也开朗了，勇气也恢复了，“我们现在要互相问候早安了。”他抓住了先前从马格里布人那里得到的短小匕首。","“A regular petite maitresse,” thought the Frenchman, seeing her roll herself about so softly and coquettishly.She licked off the blood which stained her paws and muzzle, and scratched her head with reiterated gestures full of prettiness.“All right, make a little toilet,” the Frenchman said to himself, beginning to recover his gaiety with his courage; “we’ll say good morning to each other presently;” and he seized the small, short dagger which he had taken from the Maugrabins."
"此时此刻，豹子将头转向法国人，一动不动地盯着他。她的眼睛如金属般刚硬，射出让人无法忍受的光芒，这使得他发起抖来，特别是当那动物向他走来的时候。但是，他用爱抚的眼神看着她，直视她的双眼，好吸引她，让她静静地靠近自己；然后他用温柔、亲昵的动作，像爱抚一个绝世佳人那样抚摸她。他用手来回抚摸着她整个身体，从头到尾，抓着她金色脊背中间那灵活的椎骨。这只动物风骚地摇了摇尾巴，眼睛也变得柔和了。当法国人第三次这样特意献媚时，她就像猫表示快乐那样发出阵阵的呼噜声。不过她的喉咙发出的声音洪亮而深沉，在洞穴中回响着，就像教堂里的管风琴发出的最后的鸣响。普罗斯旺人知道抚摸的重要性，就反复做着这个动作，为的是迷惑和麻痹眼前这位骄横的交际花。幸运的是，昨天她就填饱了胃口。当他确信扑灭了这个任性的伙伴的残暴之后，他站起来，走出了洞穴。豹子任由他走了出去。可是当他到达山顶的时候，她像一只从一个树枝跳往另一个树枝的麻雀一般轻盈地跳来，用身躯磨蹭他的腿，像所有种类的猫那般弓起背来。然后，她看着她的客人，眼睛里射出的光芒柔和了些。她发出了一声狂野的吼声，自然学家将这吼声比作拉锯声。","At this moment the panther turned her head toward the man and looked at him fixedly without moving.The rigidity of her metallic eyes and their insupportable luster made him shudder, especially when the animal walked towards him.But he looked at her caressingly, staring into her eyes in order to magnetize her, and let her come quite close to him; then with a movement both gentle and amorous, as though he were caressing the most beautiful of women, he passed his hand over her whole body, from the head to the tail, scratching the flexible vertebrae which divided the panther’s yellow back.The animal waved her tail voluptuously, and her eyes grew gentle; and when for the third time the Frenchman accomplished this interesting flattery, she gave forth one of those purrings by which cats express their pleasure; but this murmur issued from a throat so powerful and so deep that it resounded through the cave like the last vibrations of an organ in a church.The man, understanding the importance of his caresses, redoubled them in such a way as to surprise and stupefy his imperious courtesan.When he felt sure of having extinguished the ferocity of his capricious companion, whose hunger had so fortunately been satisfied the day before, he got up to go out of the cave; the panther let him go out, but when he had reached the summit of the hill she sprang with the lightness of a sparrow hopping from twig to twig, and rubbed herself against his legs, putting up her back after the manner of all the race of cats.Then regarding her guest with eyes whose glare had softened a little, she gave vent to that wild cry which naturalists compare to the grating of a saw."
"“她倒在要求了。”法国人微笑着说。","“She is exacting,” said the Frenchman, smilingly."
"他大胆地玩弄着她的耳朵，抚摸她的肚子，还用尽力气去挠她的头。他发现这样做很成功，于是就用匕首的尖端给她的脑壳挠痒，寻找着适当的机会来杀死她，但是她的骨头很硬，这让他有些担忧，害怕无法成功。","He was bold enough to play with her ears; he caressed her belly and scratched her head as hard as he could.When he saw that he was successful, he tickled her skull with the point of his dagger, watching for the right moment to kill her, but the hardness of her bones made him tremble for his success."
"沙漠王后对她的奴隶表示亲切。她抬起头，伸长脖子，用恬静的态度表现她内心的喜悦。士兵突然意识到，要想让这个残暴的王后一刀毙命，就必须把匕首扎进她的喉咙。","The sultana of the desert showed herself gracious to her slave; she lifted her head, stretched out her neck and manifested her delight by the tranquility of her attitude.It suddenly occurred to the soldier that to kill this savage princess with one blow he must poniard her in the throat."
"他举起了匕首，这时豹子很是满足，优雅地躺在他脚边，不时抬眼看他，尽管她生性凶猛，目光中却夹杂着一丝善意。可怜的普罗旺斯人背靠在一棵棕榈树上，吃着枣，眼睛一会儿看着沙漠，寻找可以解救他的人，一会儿看看他可怕的伙伴，好提防她那不可靠的仁慈。","He raised the blade, when the panther, satisfied no doubt, laid herself gracefully at his feet, and cast up at him glances in which, in spite of their natural fierceness, was mingled confusedly a kind of good will.The poor Provencal ate his dates, leaning against one of the palm trees, and casting his eyes alternately on the desert in quest of some liberator and on his terrible companion to watch her uncertain clemency."
"他每次扔下一颗枣核，豹子就看一下椰枣核落下的地方，她眼中展现出极度的怀疑。","The panther looked at the place where the date stones fell, and every time that he threw one down her eyes expressed an incredible mistrust."
"她像商人一般谨慎地打量着这个人。但是，她的打量对法国人来说是有利的。因为当他吃完简陋的早餐时，她就用她粗糙有力的舌头去舔他的皮靴，就连夹在褶缝里的泥都被她用非凡的技巧舔干净了。","She examined the man with an almost commercial prudence.However, this examination was favorable to him, for when he had finished his meager meal she licked his boots with her powerful rough tongue, brushing off with marvelous skill the dust gathered in the creases."
"“嗯，要是她肚子饿了该怎么办！”法国人想。尽管士兵为自己的这种想法而发抖，他还是开始好奇地目测豹子的体型，他确信她是同类中美丽的典范。不算尾巴在内，她有三英尺高，四英尺长。尾巴是有力的武器，像根圆木棒，接近三尺长。她的头与母狮的头一般大小，不同的是她那罕见的、细腻的表情。诚然，她的表情主要还是带着老虎般的冷酷和残忍，但同时也和性感的女人的脸有些相似。实际上，这位孤独王后的脸上带着尼禄皇帝醉酒的快乐神情：她已经喝血喝饱了，想玩耍了。","“Ah, but when she’s really hungry!” thought the Frenchman.In spite of the shudder this thought caused him, the soldier began to measure curiously the proportions of the panther, certainly one of the most splendid specimens of its race.She was three feet high and four feet long without counting her tail; this powerful weapon, rounded like a cudgel, was nearly three feet long.The head, large as that of a lioness, was distinguished by a rare expression of refinement.The cold cruelty of a tiger was dominant, it was true, but there was also a vague resemblance to the face of a sensual woman.Indeed, the face of this solitary queen had something of the gaiety of a drunken Nero: she had satiated herself with blood, and she wanted to play."
"士兵尝试着看看能不能走来走去，结果豹子并不反对，只是满足于用眼睛跟随着他转动。这样子不像一只忠诚的狗，而是更像一只大安哥拉猫，时刻注意着主人的一举一动。","The soldier tried if he might walk up and down, and the panther left him free, contenting herself with following him with her eyes, less like a faithful dog than a big Angora cat, observing everything and every movement of her master."
"他环顾四周时，看见自己的马的残骸就在泉水边。豹子一直把马的尸体拖到这里，已经吃掉了有三分之二。这一情景让他更加坚定了自己的决定。","When he looked around, he saw, by the spring, the remains of his horse; the panther had dragged the carcass all that way; about two thirds of it had been devoured already.The sight reassured him."
"这就好理解为什么豹子当时不在洞穴了，也好理解为什么她在他睡觉时对他不伤分毫。有了第一次的幸运，法国人胆子就大了些，他想试探一下将来的运气，他有了一个疯狂的想法，就是整天都和豹子友好相处，想尽办法来驯服她，赢得她的恩宠。","It was easy to explain the panther’s absence, and the respect she had had for him while he slept.The first piece of good luck emboldened him to tempt the future, and he conceived the wild hope of continuing on good terms with the panther during the entire day, neglecting no means of taming her, and remaining in her good graces."
"他回到她跟前，看到她用一种几乎无法察觉的动作摇了摇尾巴，他心里有种说不出的喜悦。他毫无畏惧地坐在她的身旁，和她玩了起来。他拽她的爪子和鼻口，拉她的耳朵，把她翻过来，挠她那温暖、纤细的两肋。她任他摆弄，当士兵想要抚摸她脚上的毛时，她小心地收回了利爪。","He returned to her, and had the unspeakable joy of seeing her wag her tail with an almost imperceptible movement at his approach.He sat down then, without fear, by her side, and they began to play together; he took her paws and muzzle, pulled her ears, rolled her over on her back, stroked her warm, delicate flanks.She let him do what ever he liked, and when he began to stroke the hair on her feet she drew her claws in carefully."
"这个法国人，一只手握着匕首，想要直接把它插入这只轻信于人的豹子的腹部，可是他又担心自己会立马被她的垂死反扑而扼杀。而且，他感到心中有种自责，告诉他要尊重一个从未伤害过自己的动物。他觉得自己在无边无际的沙漠里找到了朋友。他不由自主地想到了他的第一个情人，他昵称那个情人为“娇娘”，不过这是反话，因为她的嫉妒之心十分恶劣。在他们相爱的日子里，她总是拿着刀子威胁他，这让他很害怕。","The man, keeping the dagger in one hand, thought to plunge it into the belly of the too confiding panther, but he was afraid that he would be immediately strangled in her last convulsive struggle; besides, he felt in his heart a sort of remorse which bid him respect a creature that had done him no harm.He seemed to have found a friend, in a boundless desert; half unconsciously he thought of his first sweetheart, whom he had nicknamed “Mignonne” by way of contrast, because she was so atrociously jealous that all the time of their love he was in fear of the knife with which she had always threatened him."
"过去的回忆让他想用这个昵称来称呼这只年轻的豹子。现在他开始欣赏她的敏捷、顺从和温柔了，而不再像先前那样恐惧了。夜幕将至，他已经习惯了自己危险的处境，现在他几乎喜欢上了这种痛苦的感觉。最后，他的伙伴也形成了一个习惯：每当他用假音喊道“娇娘”的时候，她就会抬头望着他。","This memory of his early days suggested to him the idea of making the young panther answer to this name, now that he began to admire with less terror her swiftness, suppleness, and softness.Toward the end of the day he had familiarized himself with his perilous position; he now almost liked the painfulness of it.At last his companion had got into the habit of looking up at him whenever he cried in a falsetto voice, “Mignonne.”"
"太阳下山之时，娇娘跑着发出了好几声深沉而又忧郁的吼声。“她很有教养。”轻松愉快的士兵说，“她还会祈祷呢。”不过，只有在她的同伴保持安静的态度时，他才会在心里开这种玩笑。“过来，我的金发美女，我让你先睡。”他对她说道，等着她一入睡就开溜，一路拔腿狂奔，重新寻找蔽身之处过夜。","At the setting of the sun Mignonne gave, several times running, a profound melancholy cry.“She’s been well brought up,” said the lighthearted soldier; “she says her prayers.”But this mental joke only occurred to him when he noticed what a pacific attitude his companion remained in.“Come, ma petite blonde, I’ll let you go to bed first,” he said to her, counting on the activity of his own legs to run away as quickly as possible, directly she was asleep, and seek another shelter for the night."
"士兵不耐烦地等待着逃跑的时刻。这一刻来临了，他就拼命地朝着尼罗河的方向走去。但是，他在沙漠中还没走到四分之一里格，就听到豹子在后面跳跃着追赶他的声音，豹子还发出拉锯般的吼声，那是一种比她跳跃的声响更恐怖的吼声。","The soldier waited with impatience the hour of his flight, and when it had arrived he walked vigorously in the direction of the Nile; but hardly had he made a quarter of a league in the sand when he heard the panther bounding after him, crying with that saw-like cry more dreadful even than the sound of her leaping."
"“啊！”他说，“她已经喜欢上我了，她以前从未遇见过任何人，得到她的初恋真是让人很愉快。”突然，法国人一下子陷入了一片流沙中，对旅游者来说，流沙是极为恐怖的，一旦陷入就不可能自救。他感觉自己已经陷进去了，发出了一声求救的尖叫。豹子用牙齿咬住他的衣领，用力往后一拔，神奇地将他拖出了旋转的沙子。","“Ah!” he said, “then she’s taken a fancy to me, she has never met anyone before, and it is really quite flattering to have her first love.”That instant the man fell into one of those movable quicksands so terrible to travelers and from which it is impossible to save oneself.Feeling himself caught, he gave a shriek of alarm; the panther seized him with her teeth by the collar, and, springing vigorously backwards, drew him as if by magic out of the whirling sand."
"“啊，娇娘！”士兵一边哭喊，一边热切地抚摸着她，“记住，从这一刻起，我和你生死与共，决不失言！”之后他就从原路返回。","“Ah, Mignonne!” cried the soldier, caressing her enthusiastically; “we’re bound together for life and death but no jokes, mind!” and he retraced his steps."
"从那时候起，这个沙漠似乎就有了人烟。这里居住着一只生物，法国人可以和她说话，她那凶猛的脾气让他给驯得温柔了，虽然他自己也不能解释为什么他们之间会产生奇异的友谊。尽管士兵竭力想保持戒备，可是他还是睡着了。","From that time the desert seemed inhabited.It contained a being to whom the man could talk, and whose ferocity was rendered gentle by him, though he could not explain to himself the reason for their strange friendship.Great as was the soldier’s desire to stay upon guard, he slept."
"他醒来时，发现娇娘不见了。他登上山顶，看见娇娘从远处跳跃着向他这边过来，跳跃是这些动物的习惯，由于他们的脊柱非常柔软，所以他们不能奔跑。娇娘来到他身旁，嘴边沾有血迹。她接受了同伴一贯的抚摸，用几声呼噜声表示她有多幸福。她的眼睛充满了疲惫，却用比昨日更加温柔的目光转过来望着普罗旺斯人，普罗旺斯人和她说话的语气就像在和一只驯服的动物说话一样。","On awakening he could not find Mignonne; he mounted the hill, and in the distance saw her springing toward him after the habit of these animals, who cannot run on account of the extreme flexibility of the vertebral column.Mignonne arrived, her jaws covered with blood; she received the wonted caress of her companion, showing with much purring how happy it made her.Her eyes, full of languor, turned still more gently than the day before toward the Provencal, who talked to her as one would to a tame animal."
"“啊！姑娘，你真是一个好姑娘，不是吗？看！我们都喜欢让人抚爱，对吧？你不感到羞愧吗？你已经吃了一些阿拉伯人或其他人，是吧？这无关紧要。他们和你一样都是动物；可是不许你吃法国人，否则我就不再喜欢你了。”","“Ah! mademoiselle, you are a nice girl, aren’t you?Just look at that!So we like to be made much of, don’t we?Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?So you have been eating some Arab or other, have you?That doesn’t matter.They’re animals just the same as you are; but don’t you take to eating Frenchmen, or I shan’t like you any longer.”"
"她像一只同主人玩耍的狗，任凭自己被交替地推翻、推打或轻抚。有时，她自己会主动伸出爪子，摆出请求的姿势挑逗士兵。","She played like a dog with its master, letting herself be rolled over, knocked about, and stroked, alternately; sometimes she herself would provoke the soldier, putting up her paw with a soliciting gesture."
"好几天就这样过去了。有娇娘的陪伴，普罗旺斯人可以欣赏沙漠壮丽的景色。此刻，他有了可以思念的生物，有时感到恐惧，有时感到平静。他有了很多吃的东西，心里充满了矛盾，他的生活开始多姿多彩起来。","Some days passed in this manner.This companionship permitted the Provencal to appreciate the sublime beauty of the desert; now that he had a living thing to think about, alternations of fear and quiet, and plenty to eat, his mind became filled with contrast and his life began to be diversified."
"孤独向他展现了它所有的秘密，并用它的快乐包裹着他。他发现了世人都不曾见过的日出和日落的景象。每当他听到偶尔飞过头顶的鸟儿那嘶嘶的振翅声，或者看到相互交融的云朵——云朵千变万化，犹如穿着各色彩衣的旅人——他都会战栗。夜里，他研究月光照射在沙海上的效果。干热风让这里变得波浪起伏、变幻无穷。他同东方人一样生活，惊叹这里的壮丽；有时，他陶醉于观看平原上刮起的飓风，只见流沙回转，形成红色的、干燥的迷雾和使人致命的云朵；观看了这些景象之后，他会满怀喜悦地迎接夜晚的到来，因为他可以享受满天星光给他带来的健康的清新感，还可以聆听想象中的天籁之音。此外，孤独还教会他去发掘梦想的宝库。他花了很多时间去回忆零碎的琐事，将过去的生活和现在的生活作对比。","Solitude revealed to him all her secrets, and enveloped him in her delights.He discovered in the rising and setting of the sun sights unknown to the world.He knew what it was to tremble when he heard over his head the hiss of a bird’s wing, so rarely did they pass, or when he saw the clouds, changing and many colored travelers, melt one into another.He studied in the night time the effect of the moon upon the ocean of sand, where the simoom made waves swift of movement and rapid in their change.He lived the life of the Eastern day, marveling at its wonderful pomp; then, after having reveled in the sight of a hurricane over the plain where the whirling sands made red, dry mists and death-bearing clouds, he would welcome the night with joy, for then fell the healthful freshness of the stars, and he listened to imaginary music in the skies.Then solitude taught him to unroll the treasures of dreams.He passed whole hours in remembering mere nothings, and comparing his present life with his past."
"最后，他对豹子有了浓厚的感情，因为感情对他来说是必需的。","At last he grew passionately fond of the panther; for some sort of affection was a necessity."
"也许是由于同伴的性格被他的意志有力地改变了，也许是因为她在沙漠捕食的远足中找到了丰富的食物，她尊重着法国人的生命。法国人看她如此驯良，也不再害怕她了。","Whether it was that his will powerfully projected had modified the character of his companion, or whether, because she found abundant food in her predatory excursions in the desert, she respected the man’s life, he began to fear for it no longer, seeing her so well tamed."
"他大部分时间都在睡觉，但是他不得不保持警惕，就像蜘蛛网上的蜘蛛一样，害怕万一地平线上有人路过，稍一走神就会失去获救的机会。他已经牺牲了他的衬衫来做了一面旗子，他将这面旗子挂在一棵棕榈树的顶端，树叶被他剥光了。他觉得有必要找到办法把旗子展开，便把旗子拴在一些小木棍上。因为当路过的旅人在沙漠里张望时，可能恰好没有风。","He devoted the greater part of his time to sleep, but he was obliged to watch like a spider in its web that the moment of his deliverance might not escape him, if anyone should pass the line marked by the horizon.He had sacrificed his shirt to make a flag with, which he hung at the top of a palm tree, whose foliage he had torn off.Taught by necessity, he found the means of keeping it spread out, by fastening it with little sticks; for the wind might not be blowing at the moment when the passing traveler was looking through the desert."
"正是在这些漫长的时间里，当他已经不抱希望的时候，他就会和豹子一起玩耍。他已经学会辨别她不同的喊声和不同的眼神，他已经看懂了她金色袍子上变幻莫测的斑点。当他抓住她尾巴末端的一簇毛想数一下上面的环时，娇娘并没有生气，这些优美的装饰在太阳光下像珠宝似的闪闪发光。他乐意欣赏她优美而柔和的线条、白色的肚子，还有她头部那优美的姿势。他尤其喜欢在她玩耍时看着她：她十分敏捷、动作轻盈，显得十分年轻，这些给了他一个个的惊喜；她跳跃、爬行、清洗身体、整理毛发、蜷下身来、准备跳跃，其动作之灵敏，让他惊叹不已。不管她跳得有多迅速，不管她站的石头有多滑，只要听到“娇娘”二字，她总会停下来。","It was during the long hours, when he had abandoned hope, that he amused himself with the panther.He had come to learn the different inflections of her voice, the expressions of her eyes; he had studied the capricious patterns of all the rosettes which marked the gold of her robe.Mignonne was not even angry when he took hold of the tuft at the end of her tail to count her rings, those graceful ornaments which glittered in the sun like jewelry.It gave him pleasure to contemplate the supple, fine outlines of her form, the whiteness of her belly, the graceful pose of her head.But it was especially when she was playing that he felt most pleasure in looking at her; the agility and youthful lightness of her movements were a continual surprise to him; he wondered at the supple way in which she jumped and climbed, washed herself and arranged her fur, crouched down and prepared to spring.However rapid her spring might be, however slippery the stone she was on, she would always stop short at the word “Mignonne.”"
"一天，阳光明媚，一只巨大的鸟在空中盘旋。法国人离开豹子，独自看着他新来的客人；但是片刻之后，遭到抛弃的王后便低声咆哮起来。","One day, in a bright midday sun, an enormous bird coursed through the air.The man left his panther to look at his new guest; but after waiting a moment the deserted sultana growled deeply."
"“天哪！她一定是嫉妒了。”看到她的双眼再次变得强硬，他喊道，“毫无疑问，维尔日妮的灵魂已经附到她身上了。”","“My goodness! I do believe she’s jealous,” he cried, seeing her eyes become hard again; “the soul of Virginie has passed into her body; that’s certain.”"
"当士兵欣赏豹子那弯曲的轮廓时，那只鹰早已消失在空中。","The eagle disappeared into the air, while the soldier admired the curved contour of the panther."
"但是，她的体态是那样年轻，那样优雅！她简直像女人那样美！她金袍子上的毛皮与两肋浅浅的白色相得益彰。","But there was such youth and grace in her form! she was beautiful as a woman! the blond fur of her robe mingled well with the delicate tints of faint white which marked her flanks."
"充足的阳光投射下来，使得她身上鲜亮的金色和这些褐色的斑点熊熊燃烧，产生了无法形容的吸引力。","The profuse light cast down by the sun made this living gold, these russet markings, to burn in a way to give them an indefinable attraction."
"普罗旺斯人和豹子深情地对望了一眼，当她感觉她的朋友拍打着她的脑袋时，多情的女郎战栗了一下，她的眼睛射出闪电般的光芒，然后又紧紧闭上了。","The man and the panther looked at one another with a look full of meaning; the coquette quivered when she felt her friend stroke her head; her eyes flashed like lightning—then she shut them tightly."
"“她有灵魂。”看着这个安静的沙漠王后，他说道。她像沙子般金黄，像沙子般雪白，像沙子般孤独，又像沙子般灼热。","“She has a soul,” he said, looking at the stillness of this queen of the sands, golden like them, white like them, solitary and burning like them."
"“很好，”她说，“我已经读了那篇你为野兽做辩护的文章。可是，他俩是如此理解彼此，又怎会结束呢？”","“Well,” she said, “I have read your plea in favor of beasts; but how did two so well adapted to understand each other end?”"
"“噢，是这样的！你知道，就像一切伟大的爱情的结局一样，他们之所以结束也是出于误会。出于某种原因，双方都认为对方不忠。但出于傲慢他们都不愿做出解释，他们会争吵，他们分手完全是因为固执。”","“Ah, well! you see, they ended as all great passions do end—by a misunderstanding.For some reason ONE suspects the other of treason; they don’t come to an explanation through pride, and quarrel and part from sheer obstinacy.”"
"“其实有时候，在最恰当的时刻，一句话或一道目光就够了。但是，不管怎样，还是继续讲你的故事吧。”","“Yet sometimes at the best moments a single word or a look is enough—but anyhow go on with your story.”"
"“这相当困难，不过当你听完这个老兵喝完香槟酒后所讲的话，你就会明白整个故事。他说：‘我不知道有没有伤着她，但是她转过身，好像怒了，用她锋利的牙齿咬住我的腿——我敢说，动作很轻。可是我，我以为她要吃我，就把匕首刺进了她的喉咙。她在地上打滚，发出了一声怒吼，让我的心都凉了。我看到她在垂死挣扎，眼睛看着我，却没有愤怒。我真想奉献我的一切——包括我当时还没拿到手的十字勋章——让她重新活过来。我感觉像是谋杀了一个活生生的人。看见我的旗子的那些士兵过来帮助我，他们发现我泪流满面。’","“It’s horribly difficult, but you will understand, after what the old villain told me over his champagne.He said—‘I don’t know if I hurt her, but she turned round, as if enraged, and with her sharp teeth caught hold of my leg—gently, I daresay; but I, thinking she would devour me, plunged my dagger into her throat.She rolled over, giving a cry that froze my heart; and I saw her dying, still looking at me without anger.I would have given all the world—my cross even, which I had not got then—to have brought her to life again.It was as though I had murdered a real person; and the soldiers who had seen my flag, and were come to my assistance, found me in tears.’"
"“‘就这些，先生。’沉默片刻后，他说，‘从那以后，我在德国、西班牙、俄国和法国打过仗。我确实行尸走肉般地去过很多地方，却从来没有见过像沙漠那样的地方。啊！是的，沙漠太美了！’","“‘Well sir,’ he said, after a moment of silence, ‘since then I have been in war in Germany, in Spain, in Russia, in France; I’ve certainly carried my carcase about a good deal, but never have I seen anything like the desert.Ah! yes, it is very beautiful!’"
"“‘你在那里感觉怎样？’我问他。","“‘What did you feel there?’ I asked him."
"“‘哦！年轻人，这是无以言状的！","“‘Oh! that can’t be described, young man!"
"再说了，我不会总是为那些棕榈树和我的豹子而感到惋惜。我只在心情极度忧郁的时候才想起这些。要知道，在沙漠里，什么都有，又什么都没有。’","Besides, I am not always regretting my palm trees and my panther.I should have to be very melancholy for that.In the desert, you see, there is everything and nothing.’"
"“‘是啊，但请解释一下——’","“‘Yes, but explain—’"
"“‘嗯，’他一边做了一个不耐烦的手势，一边说，‘只有上帝，没有人类。’”","“‘Well,’ he said, with an impatient gesture, ‘it is God without mankind.’”"
