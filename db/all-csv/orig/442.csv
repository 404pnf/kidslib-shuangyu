"Habogi","哈博基"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there lived two peasants who had three daughters, and, as generally happens, the youngest was the most beautiful and the best tempered, and when her sisters wanted to go out she was always ready to stay at home and do their work.","从前，有一对农民夫妇，他们有三个女儿。一般来说，最小的女儿是最美丽、最乖巧的，这家也不例外。当她的姐姐们想要出去玩时，小女儿总是甘愿留在家里，替她们干活。"
"Years passed quickly with the whole family, and one day the parents suddenly perceived that all three girls were grown up, and that very soon they would be thinking of marriage.","一年年飞快地过去了，有一天，夫妇俩忽然意识到，三个女儿都已经长大成人，并且很快就该谈婚论嫁了。"
"‘Have you decided what your husband’s name is to be?’ said the father, laughingly, to his eldest daughter, one evening when they were all sitting at the door of their cottage.","一天傍晚，当全家人都坐在屋门口时，父亲笑着问大女儿：“你想好你未来丈夫的名字了吗？"
"‘You know that is a very important point!’","你知道这可是相当重要的！”"
"‘Yes; I will never wed any man who is not called Sigmund,’ answered she.","“我已经想好了，我只嫁给叫西格蒙德的人。”大女儿回答。"
"‘Well, it is lucky for you that there are a great many Sigmunds in this part of the world,’ replied her father, ‘so that you can take your choice!","“嗯，那你很幸运，咱们这儿有很多叫西格蒙德的，”父亲回答道，“所以你可以随便挑！"
"And what do YOU say?’ he added, turning to the second.","那你呢？”他转向二女儿，又接着问道。"
"‘Oh, I think that there is no name so beautiful as Sigurd,’ cried she.","“噢，我认为再没有比西格德更美的名字了。”她喊道。"
"‘Then you won’t be an old maid either,’ answered he.","“那么你也不用担心嫁不出去，”他回答，"
"‘There are seven Sigurds in the next village alone!","“光邻村就有七个叫西格德的！"
"And you, Helga?’","那么你呢，赫尔格？”"
"Helga, who was still the prettiest of the three, looked up.","赫尔格抬起头来，她现在仍然是三姐妹中最漂亮的一个。"
"She also had her favourite name, but, just as she was going to say it, she seemed to hear a voice whisper: ‘Marry no one who is not called Habogi.’","她也有自己最喜欢的名字，但是，正当她准备说出来时，她似乎听到一个声音低声说：“非哈博基不嫁。”"
"The girl had never heard of such a name, and did not like it, so she determined to pay no attention; but as she opened her mouth to tell her father that her husband must be called Njal, she found herself answering instead: ‘If I do marry it will be to no one except Habogi.’","小女儿从未听说过这个名字，而且并不喜欢它，因此她决定不理会。但是，当她开口要告诉父亲，她的丈夫一定要叫尼雅尔时，她却发现自己回答道：“如果我要结婚的话，我只会嫁给哈博基。”"
"‘Who IS Habogi?’ asked her father and sisters; ‘We never heard of such a person.’","“谁是哈博基？”她的父亲和姐姐们问道，“我们从未听过这个人。”"
"‘All I can tell you is that he will be my husband, if ever I have one,’ returned Helga; and that was all she would say.","“我唯一能告诉你们的是，如果我以后有丈夫的话，就一定是他。”赫尔格答道，并且执意不改口。"
"Before very long the young men who lived in the neighbouring villages or on the sides of the mountains, had heard of this talk of the three girls, and Sigmunds and Sigurds in scores came to visit the little cottage.","没过多久，住在邻村和山坡上的年轻小伙子们都听说了三姐妹的这次谈话。叫西格蒙德和西格德的小伙子纷纷登门求亲。"
"There were other young men too, who bore different names, though not one of them was called ‘Habogi,’ and these thought that they might perhaps gain the heart of the youngest.","还有其他的年轻人前来，他们的名字五花八门，却没有一个叫“哈博基”的。这些人都想要碰碰运气，获得小女儿的芳心。"
"But though there was more than one ‘Njal’ amongst them, Helga’s eyes seemed always turned another way.","尽管他们中有不止一个人叫尼雅尔，赫尔格却似乎总是瞧也不瞧一眼。"
"At length the two elder sisters made their choice from out of the Sigurds and the Sigmunds, and it was decided that both weddings should take place at the same time.","最后，两个姐姐从叫西格德和西格蒙德的人里选出了她们的丈夫，并且决定同时举行婚礼。"
"Invitations were sent out to the friends and relations, and when, on the morning of the great day, they were all assembled, a rough, coarse old peasant left the crowd and came up to the brides’ father.","亲朋好友们都收到了请柬。在婚礼当天早上，当大家聚在一起时，人群中走出一个相貌丑陋、外表粗俗的老农，他来到新娘们的父亲跟前。"
"‘My name is Habogi, and Helga must be my wife,’ was all he said.","他只说道：“我的名字叫哈博基，我必须娶赫尔格为妻。”"
"And though Helga stood pale and trembling with surprise, she did not try to run away.","尽管赫尔格大惊失色，浑身颤抖，却并没有试图逃走。"
"‘I cannot talk of such things just now,’ answered the father, who could not bear the thought of giving his favourite daughter to this horrible old man, and hoped, by putting it off, that something might happen.","“我眼下还不能谈论这些事情。”父亲回答。他不忍心将自己最宠爱的小女儿嫁给这样一个相貌丑陋的老头，于是找借口推脱，希望事情能出现转机。"
"But the sisters, who had always been rather jealous of Helga, were secretly pleased that their bridegrooms should outshine hers.","可是，两个姐姐从小就十分嫉妒赫尔格，看到自己的新郎比她的强，心里都暗自得意。"
"When the feast was over, Habogi led up a beautiful horse from a field where he had left it to graze, and bade Helga jump up on its splendid saddle, all embroidered in scarlet and gold.","婚宴结束后，哈博基牵来了一匹原先放在牧场吃草的骏马，然后招呼赫尔格跃上马背，坐在绣着红色和金色图案的华丽鞍座上。"
"‘You shall come back again,’ said he; ‘but now you must see the house that you are to live in.’","“你会再回来的，”哈博基说，“但是现在，你必须去看看你将居住的新房。”"
" And though Helga was very unwilling to go, something inside her forced her to obey.","尽管赫尔格非常不情愿去，她身体里却有种东西迫使她顺从。"
"The old man settled her comfortably, then sprang up in front of her as easily as if he had been a boy, and, shaking the reins, they were soon out of sight.","老人将她扶上马背坐稳，然后自己跃上马背，坐到姑娘前面，动作轻松敏捷，如同小伙子一般。他抖动缰绳，很快，他们就消失在了众人的视野之中。"
"After some miles they rode through a meadow with grass so green that Helga’s eyes felt quite dazzled; and feeding on the grass were a quantity of large fat sheep, with the curliest and whitest wool in the world.","奔驰了几英里后，他们来到一片草原，牧草绿澄澄的，油亮得令赫尔格头晕目眩；草原上有成群的大肥羊在吃草，它们有着世界上最卷、最白的绒毛。"
"‘What lovely sheep! whose are they?’ cried Helga.","“多可爱的绵羊啊！是谁家的？”赫尔格惊呼道。"
"‘Your Habogi’s,’ answered he, ‘all that you see belongs to him; but the finest sheep in the whole herd, which has little golden bells hanging between its horns, you shall have for yourself.’","“是你的哈博基的，”他回答，“你所看到的一切都属于他；整个羊群里最好的羊，就是羊角间挂着小金铃铛的那只，是属于你的。”"
"This pleased Helga very much, for she had never had anything of her own; and she smiled quite happily as she thanked Habogi for his present.","这让赫尔格非常高兴，因为她还从未有过真正属于自己的东西。她开心极了，微笑着感谢哈博基的礼物。"
"They soon left the sheep behind them, and entered a large field with a river running through it, where a number of beautiful grey cows were standing by a gate waiting for a milk-maid to come and milk them.","他们很快就将羊群甩在了后面，进入了一片辽阔的牧场，还有一条河从牧场穿过，牧场里一大群漂亮的灰色奶牛站在一个栅栏门口，等着女工前来挤奶。"
"‘Oh, what lovely cows!’ cried Helga again; ‘I am sure their milk must be sweeter than any other cows.","“啊，多可爱的奶牛啊！”赫尔格又喊道，“我敢肯定，它们挤出的奶一定是最香甜的。"
"How I should like to have some!","我真想喝上几口！"
"I wonder to whom they belong?’","我想知道它们是谁的？”"
"‘To your Habogi,’ replied he; ‘and some day you shall have as much milk as you like, but we cannot stop now.","“属于你的哈博基的，”他回答，“而且总有一天，你能喝上它们的奶，要多少有多少，不过现在我们还不能停下来。"
"Do you see that big grey one, with the silver bells between her horns?","你看到犄角间挂着银铃铛的那头大灰牛了吗？"
"That is to be yours, and you can have her milked every morning the moment you wake.’","它将是你的，而且每天早上你一睁眼，你就能让人去挤它的奶。”"
"And Helga’s eyes shone, and though she did not say anything, she thought that she would learn to milk the cow herself.","赫尔格兴奋得两眼发光，尽管嘴里没说什么，心里却想要自己学会亲手挤奶。"
"A mile further on they came to a wide common, with short, springy turf, where horses of all colours, with skins of satin, were kicking up their heels in play.","他们又骑了一英里，来到了一片广阔的公共牧场，这里的牧草松软矮小，还有五颜六色的骏马在腾跳嬉戏，它们的皮毛如绸缎般光亮。"
"The sight of them so delighted Helga that she nearly sprang from her saddle with a shriek of joy.","看到它们，赫尔格欢喜得大叫一声，差点儿从马背上跳下来。"
"‘Whose are they?’","“它们是谁家的？"
" Oh! whose are they?’ she asked.","噢！到底是谁家的？”她问道，"
"‘How happy any man must be who is the master of such lovely creatures!’","“这些可爱的家伙们的主人真是太幸福了！”"
"‘They are your Habogi’s,’ replied he, ‘and the one which you think the most beautiful of all you shall have for yourself, and learn to ride him.’","“它们是你的哈博基的，”他回答，“而且你可以拥有你认为最漂亮的一匹，然后学习骑它。”"
"At this Helga quite forgot the sheep and the cow.","听到这里，赫尔格早就将绵羊和奶牛抛到了脑后。"
"‘A horse of my own!’ said she.","“一匹我自己的马！”她喊道，"
"‘Oh, stop one moment, and let me see which I will choose.","“噢，快停下来让我挑挑，就一会儿。"
"The white one?","白色的那匹？"
"No.","不好。"
"The chestnut?","栗色的？"
"No.","也不好。"
"I think, after all, I like the coal-black one best, with the little white star on his forehead.","我觉得还是墨黑色的那匹最讨人喜欢，它额头上还带着小小的白色星形印记呢。"
"Oh, do stop, just for a minute.’","哎呀，你倒是停一下嘛，就一会儿。”"
"But Habogi would not stop or listen.","但是哈博基并没有听从，也没有停下来。"
"‘When you are married you will have plenty of time to choose one,’ was all he answered, and they rode on two or three miles further.","“等你嫁给我后，你有的是时间挑选。”他只答道。随后，他们又骑了两三英里地。"
"At length Habogi drew rein before a small house, very ugly and mean-looking, and that seemed on the point of tumbling to pieces.","最终，哈博基在一间小屋前收住了缰绳。这间小屋破旧寒酸、丑陋不堪，似乎随时都会倾塌成一堆瓦砾。"
"‘This is my house, and is to be yours,’ said Habogi, as he jumped down and held out his arms to lift Helga from the horse.","“这就是我的房子，也将是你的。”说着，哈博基跳下马，伸出手臂将赫尔格扶了下来。"
"The girl’s heart sank a little, as she thought that the man who possessed such wonderful sheep, and cows, and horses, might have built himself a prettier place to live in; but she did not say so.","姑娘的心微微一沉，觉得这个人拥有这么多上好的牛羊和骏马，本可以给他自己建一个更加漂亮的居所，但她并没有说出口。"
"And, taking her arm, he led her up the steps.","然后，哈博基挽着她，踏上了门前的台阶。"
"But when she got inside, she stood quite bewildered at the beauty of all around her.","但当她走进屋子，看到四周精美的摆设，不觉惊呆了。"
"None of her friends owned such things, not even the miller, who was the richest man she knew.","她的朋友中没有一个人拥有这些东西，就连她所知道的最有钱的磨坊主都没有。"
"There were carpets everywhere, thick and soft, and of deep rich colours; and the cushions were of silk, and made you sleepy even to look at them; and curious little figures in china were scattered about.","地上到处铺满了绚丽华贵的毛毯，既厚实又松软；垫子都是丝绸面料，让人光是看着就有了睡意；四周还摆满了珍奇的小瓷器雕像。"
"Helga felt as if it would take her all her life to see everything properly, and it only seemed a second since she had entered the house, when Habogi came up to her.","赫尔格觉得，她得花一辈子的时间，才能将每样东西都仔仔细细地看个够。但似乎她刚进屋没一会儿，哈博基就凑了过来。"
"‘I must begin the preparations for our wedding at once,’ he said; ‘but my foster-brother will take you home, as I promised.","“我必须立刻开始筹备我们的婚礼了，”他说道，“但正如我先前承诺的，我那个没有血缘的兄弟会送你回家。"
"In three days he will bring you back here, with your parents and sisters, and any guests you may invite, in your company.","三天后，他会再把你接回来，让你的父母、姐姐们和你想邀请的任何宾客陪你一起来。"
"By that time the feast will be ready.’","到那时，婚宴也准备好了。”"
"Helga had so much to think about, that the ride home appeared very short.","一路上，赫尔格思前想后，不知不觉就回到了家。"
"Her father and mother were delighted to see her, as they did not feel sure that so ugly and cross-looking a man as Habogi might not have played her some cruel trick.","她的父母看到她非常高兴，因为他们一直不放心，生怕像哈博基这样一个看起来丑陋乖戾的人会对她耍什么狠毒的花招。"
"And after they had given her some supper they begged her to tell them all she had done.","招呼女儿吃过晚饭后，他们央求她告诉他们她都做了些什么。"
"But Helga only told them that they should see for themselves on the third day, when they would come to her wedding.","但是赫尔格只跟他们说，到第三天去参加她的婚礼时，他们可以自己去看。"
"It was very early in the morning when the party set out, and Helga’s two sisters grew green with envy as they passed the flocks of sheep, and cows, and horses, and heard that the best of each was given to Helga herself; but when they caught sight of the poor little house which was to be her home their hearts grew light again.","婚礼当天，送亲队伍一大早就出发了，当赫尔格的两个姐姐穿过成群的牛羊和骏马，又听说其中最好的都送给了赫尔格时，心里别提多妒忌了。但是，当她们看到妹妹的新房又破又小时，心里又暗自开心起来。"
"‘I should be ashamed of living in such a place,’ whispered each to the other; and the eldest sister spoke of the carved stone over HER doorway, and the second boasted of the number of rooms SHE had.","“我要是住在这种地方，一定感觉很丢人。”两个姐姐相互窃窃私语。随后，大女儿夸耀起自家门口的雕花大石，二女儿吹嘘自家宅院有很多的房间。"
"But the moment they went inside they were struck dumb with rage at the splendour of everything, and their faces grew white and cold with fury when they saw the dress which Habogi had prepared for his bride—a dress that glittered like sunbeams dancing upon ice.","但是，她们一进屋，屋内华丽的景象便使她们气得说不出话来，而当看到哈博基为新娘准备的礼服——一件如冰面上跃动的阳光般绚丽的婚纱时，她们的脸更是气得煞白、冰冷。"
"‘She SHALL not look so much finer than us,’ they cried passionately to each other as soon as they were alone; and when night came they stole out of their rooms, and taking out the wedding-dress, they laid it in the ash-pit, and heaped ashes upon it.","“说什么也不能让她比我们风光这么多。”她们一独处，就相互激动地嚷了起来。到了晚上，她俩偷偷溜出房间，将婚纱偷拿出来，把它放进灰坑，然后往上堆灰。"
"But Habogi, who knew a little magic, and had guessed what they would do, changed the ashes into roses, and cast a spell over the sisters, so that they could not leave the spot for a whole day, and every one who passed by mocked at them.","但是哈博基懂一点儿魔法，而且早就料到她们要干的事，于是将灰尘变成朵朵玫瑰，并对两个姐姐施咒语，让她们一整天都不能离开灰坑，路过的每一个人也都嘲笑她们。"
"The next morning when they all awoke the ugly tumble-down house had disappeared, and in its place stood a splendid palace.","第二天早上，当所有的人醒来时，丑陋不堪、摇摇欲坠的房子消失了，取而代之的是一座富丽堂皇的宫殿。"
"The guests’ eyes sought in vain for the bridegroom, but could only see a handsome young man, with a coat of blue velvet and silver and a gold crown upon his head.","宾客们左顾右盼，到处找不到新郎的身影，却只看见一个英俊的年轻人，身穿镶银的蓝色天鹅绒外套，头戴金色王冠。"
"‘Who is that?’ they asked Helga.","“那是谁？”他们问赫尔格。"
"‘That is my Habogi,’ said she.","“那是我的哈博基。”她回答。"
