"The Bunyip","沼泽怪兽"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Long, long ago, far, far away on the other side of the world, some young men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and children.","很久很久以前，在世界另一端遥远的地方，一些年轻人离开了他们居住的营地，去为他们的妻子和孩子们寻找食物。"
"The sun was hot, but they liked heat, and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest, or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang, which always returns to the thrower.","太阳很晒，但是他们喜欢高温，在行进的过程中他们比赛跑步，比赛谁可以把矛抢投掷得最远，或者谁可以灵巧地投掷一种叫做回旋镖的奇怪武器，这种武器总是在飞出去以后回到掷镖人那里。"
"They did not get on very fast at this rate, but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water, but was now, in the height of summer, only a set of pools, each surrounded with a fringe of plants, with bulrushes standing in the inside of all.","以这种速度，他们走得并不快，但不久他们就来到了一块平坦的地方。如果是在洪水季节，这里就会积满水，而现在，在夏季的高温下，这里只有几个池塘，每个池塘外围都长满植物，池塘里长满香蒲。"
"In that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes, which they think as good as onions, and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp.","在那个国度，人们都喜食香蒲根。他们认为它是和洋葱一样优质的食物，并且一个年轻人说，他们最好可以采集一些香蒲根带回营地。"
"It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket, and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out: ‘After all, why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children?","没花多长时间，他们就用水柳枝梢编成了一个篮子，当他们正准备涉水去拔香蒲根的时候，一个年轻人突然喊道：“我们到底为什么要浪费时间去做那些只适合妇人和小孩做的事呢？"
"Let them come and get the roots for themselves; but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get.’","让她们过来采集这些香蒲根，而我们就可以去捉些鳗鱼，或者去抓些别的我们可以捕获的东西。”"
"This delighted the rest of the party, and they all began to arrange their fishing lines, made from the bark of the yellow mimosa, and to search for bait for their hooks.","这样一说，其他人都很高兴，于是他们开始装鱼线，鱼线是用含羞草的茎做成的，然后他们去寻找挂在鱼钩上的鱼饵。"
"Most of them used worms, but one, who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet, cut off a little bit and baited his line with it, unseen by his companions.","大多数人都是用蠕虫做鱼饵，但有一个人在毛皮夹子里面放了一块用来做晚餐的生肉。他把肉切下来一点儿挂在线上做鱼饵，其他人都没有看到。"
"For a long time they cast patiently, without receiving a single bite; the sun had grown low in the sky, and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed, not even with a basket of roots to show; when the youth, who had baited his hook with raw meat, suddenly saw his line disappear under the water.","他们耐心地抛撒鱼饵，过了很长时间，也没有一条鱼来咬，太阳慢慢地落下，看来他们得空手而回了，甚至连一篮香蒲根都没有带回去。这时，那个鱼钩上面挂着生肉的年轻人突然看到他的鱼线消失在水底。"
"Something, a very heavy fish he supposed, was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet, and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool.","有东西上钩，他想，可能是一条很重的鱼。鱼钩那端拉扯的力气很大，几乎都让他站不住脚，僵持了几分钟后，看起来他不得不放开鱼线，否则他就会被拉进池塘的。"
"He cried to his friends to help him, and at last, trembling with fright at what they were going to see, they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal, but something of both, with a long, broad tail.","他大声呼喊他的朋友们过来帮忙，最后他们看到的东西却让他们吓得发抖，他们设法把这个动物弄上岸。它看起来既不像小牛也不像海豹，而是介于两者之间，长着长而宽大的尾巴。"
"They looked at each other with horror, cold shivers running down their spines; for though they had never beheld it, there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was—the cub of the awful Bunyip!","他们面面相觑，惊恐不已，后背阵阵寒意，因为他们从来没见过这种动物，他们中没有一个人知道这种动物是什么——这是可怕的沼泽怪兽的幼兽！"
"All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail, answered by another from the other side of the pool, as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them, rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes.","突然，一阵低沉的号啕声打破了沉默，从池塘的另一端传来一声回应，幼兽的母亲从兽穴中起身朝他们走来，它可怕的黄色眼睛中迸射出愤怒的光芒。"
"‘Let it go! let it go!’ whispered the young men to each other; but the captor declared that he had caught it, and was going to keep it.","“把它放了！把它放了！”这些年轻人互相小声说，但是抓获它的人说，他已经抓住它了，他是不会放它的。"
"‘He had promised his sweetheart,’ he said, ‘that he would bring back enough meat for her father’s house to feast on for three days, and though they could not eat the little Bunyip, her brothers and sisters should have it to play with.’","“他对他的小女儿许诺过，”他说，“爸爸会带足够吃三天的肉回家，尽管他们可能不会吃这个沼泽怪兽，她的兄弟姐妹可以跟它一起玩。”"
" So, flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back, he threw the little Bunyip on to his shoulders, and set out for the camp, never heeding the poor mother’s cries of distress.","于是，他向怪兽妈妈投掷矛箭让它后退，然后把这只小怪兽扔上肩膀，返回营地，完全没留意可怜的怪兽妈妈痛苦的哀嚎。"
"By this time it was getting near sunset, and the plain was in shadow, though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright.","此时，太阳快要落山了，平原笼罩在一片阴影中，虽然山尖仍然很明亮。"
"The youths had all ceased to be afraid, when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them, and, looking round, saw that the pool was slowly rising, and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered.","这些年轻人都不再害怕了。听到身后一阵低沉的奔跑声时，他们都震惊了，回过头看到池塘的水正在慢慢上涨，他们捉到怪兽的那个地方已经被淹没了。"
"‘What could it be?’ they asked one of another; ‘there was not a cloud in the sky, yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it do before.’","“那会是什么呢？”他们互相问道，“天空没有一丝云彩，但是水却已上涨到他们以前所知道的高度。”"
" For an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen, then they turned and ran with all their might, the man with the Bunyip running faster than all.","有一刻他们如同被定住身一样，站在那里观看，然后他们转身，开始以最快的速度奔跑，那个背着小怪兽的年轻人跑得最快。"
"When he reached a high peak over-looking all the plain he stopped to take breath, and turned to see if he was safe yet.","当他到一个可以俯瞰整个平原的高地的时候，他停下来喘了一口气，回头看看他是否已经安全。"
"Safe! why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of water, and these were fast disappearing.","安全！为什么只有树梢露在这一片汪洋大海上，一切都快速地消失。"
"They must run fast indeed if they were to escape.","他们想要逃脱此地确实需要跑得很快。"
"So on they flew, scarcely feeling the ground as they went, till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes scooped out of the earth where they had all been born.","因此他们继续飞奔着，几乎连脚下的地面都感觉不到了，直到他们来到洞穴前的平地上，洞穴是从土里面铲出来的，这里是他们出生的地方。"
"The old men were sitting in front, the children were playing, and the women chattering together, when the little Bunyip fell into their midst, and there was scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible was upon them.","老人们坐在前面，小孩子们正在玩耍，妇女们成群地在聊天，当这只小怪兽被放到这群人中间时，这些小孩还完全不知道可怕的事情正降临在他们身上。"
"‘The water! the water!’ gasped one of the young men; and there it was, slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself.","“水来了！水来了！”一位年轻人上气不接下气地喊道。确实如此，水正缓慢而平稳地漫过山脊。"
"Parents and children clung together, as if by that means they could drive back the advancing flood; and the youth who had caused all this terrible catastrophe, seized his sweetheart, and cried: ‘I will climb with you to the top of that tree, and there no waters can reach us.’","父母和孩子紧紧地抱在一起，似乎这样他们就可以把涌来的水赶回去。造成这场可怕灾难的年轻人抓住他的小女儿喊道：“我们一起爬上树顶，这样水就淹不到我们了。”"
" But, as he spoke, something cold touched him, and quickly he glanced down at his feet.","但是，他正说着，有个冰凉的东西碰到了他，他匆匆向下看了一眼自己的双脚。"
"Then with a shudder he saw that they were feet no longer, but bird’s claws.","然后他打了一个冷战，发现自己的双脚不见了，变成了鸟类的爪子。"
"He looked at the girl he was clasping, and beheld a great black bird standing at his side; he turned to his friends, but a flock of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place He put up his hands to cover his face, but they were no more hands, only the ends of wings; and when he tried to speak, a noise such as he had never heard before seemed to come from his throat, which had suddenly become narrow and slender.","他看着他紧紧抱住的小女儿，然后又看到一只黑色的大鸟站在他旁边，他向他的朋友们求救，但是只有一群巨大的、可怕的动物站在他们所在的地方拍打着翅膀；他抬起手来遮住脸部，他的手不见了，变成了翅膀尖端；当他正想要说话时，一种他从来没有听过的声音似乎从他的嗓子中发出，他的声音突然变得很尖很细。"
"Already the water had risen to his waist, and he found himself sitting easily upon it, while its surface reflected back the image of a black swan, one of many.","水已经淹没到他的腰部，他发现自己很轻松地坐在水上面，这时水面倒映出一只黑天鹅的影子，当然水面上还有很多天鹅。"
"Never again did the swans become men; but they are still different from other swans, for in the night-time those who listen can hear them talk in a language that is certainly not swan’s language; and there are even sounds of laughing and talking, unlike any noise made by the swans whom we know.","这些黑天鹅再也没有变成人，但是它们和别的天鹅不同。在晚上时候，人们可以听到它们用一种不属于天鹅的语言交谈，甚至还有笑声和说话声，这些声音不像任何一种我们所知道的天鹅发出的声音。"
"The little Bunyip was carried home by its mother, and after that the waters sank back to their own channels.","这只小沼泽怪兽被它妈妈带回了家，然后水沿着之前的渠道退了下去。"
"The side of the pool where she lives is always shunned by everyone, as nobody knows when she may suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws.","每个人通常会避开怪兽居住的池塘的那一边，因为没有人知道怪兽什么时候会把头伸出来，把人拖进它那大大的嘴巴里。"
"But people say that underneath the black waters of the pool she has a house filled with beautiful things, such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no idea of.","但是人们说在池塘黑压压的水面下，有一个怪兽的房子，里面装满了美好的东西，但是这些是居住在地面上的凡人所不知道的。"
"Though how they know I cannot tell you, as nobody has ever seen it.","不过他们是怎么知道的，我没法告诉你，因为从来没有人看见它。"
