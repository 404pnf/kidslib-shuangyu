"Again she was lifted on the bull’s back, and after she had ridden far, and farer than I can tell, they came in sight o’ a far bonnier castle, and far farther awa’ than the last.","她再一次被举上了牛背，之后不知道走了多远，远处出现了一座漂亮的城堡，比第一座更漂亮，也比第一座更远。"
"Says the bull till her: “Yonder we maun be the night, for my second brither lives yonder”; and they were at the place directly.","公牛对她说：“我们今晚必须在那里过夜，因为我的第二个兄弟住在那里。”很快他们就到了城堡。"

"At last she rase and gaed awa’, she kedna whaur till.","最终，她起身离开，四处游荡。"
"On she wandered till she came to a great hill o’ glass, that she tried a’ she could to climb, bat wasna able.","她一直游荡，直到走到了一座巨大的玻璃山前，她尝试着想爬上去，可是却失败了。"
"Round the bottom o’ the hill she gaed, sabbing and seeking a passage owre, till at last she came to a smith’s house; and the smith promised, if she wad serve him seven years, he wad make her iron shoon, wherewi’ she could climb owre the glassy hill.","她沿着山脚走，一边哭一边寻找上山的路，直到最后她来到一座铁匠的房子，铁匠承诺，如果她能够为他干七年活，他就为她做一双铁鞋，让她能够爬过那座玻璃山。"
"At seven years’ end she got her iron shoon, clamb the glassy hill, and chanced to come to the auld washerwife’s habitation.","七年后她得到了那双铁鞋，她爬上玻璃山，偶然到了一个洗衣妇的住所。"
"There she was telled of a gallant young knight that had given in some bluidy sarks to wash, and whaever washed thae sarks was to be his wife.","在那里，她听说有一个勇敢的骑士拿了一件带血渍的衬衣来洗，说谁能洗掉这些血渍就可以成为他的妻子。"
"The auld wife had washed till she was tired, and then she set to her dochter, and baith washed, and they washed, and they better washed, in hopes of getting the young knight; but a’ they could do they couldna bring out a stain.","老妇人直洗到自己疲惫不堪，她叫来她的女儿跟她一起洗，她们洗啊洗啊，越洗越卖力，希望可以得到那个年轻的骑士，但她们根本洗不掉一个污点。"
"At length they set the stranger damosel to wark; and whenever she began the stains came out pure and clean, but the auld wife made the knight believe it was her dochter had washed the sarks.","最后她们让这个陌生少女去洗那件衬衣，她一开始洗，所有的污点就都消失了，衬衫变得干净洁白，但老妇人告诉骑士是她的女儿把那件衬衫洗干净了。"
"So the knight and the eldest dochter were to be married, and the stranger damosel was distracted at the thought of it, for she was deeply in love wi’ him.","于是骑士和妇人的大女儿准备结婚，一想到这个消息，少女就心烦意乱，因为她已经深深爱上了骑士。"
"So she bethought her of her apple, and breaking it, found it filled with gold and precious jewelry, the richest she had ever seen.","她想起了她的苹果，便把它切开，发现里面装满了她从未见过的金子和珍稀的珠宝，价值连城。"
"“All these,” she said to the eldest dochter, “I will give you, on condition that you put off your marriage for ae day, and allow me to go into his room alone at night.”","“所有这些，”她对老妇人的大女儿说，“我都给你，只要你能够把婚期推迟一天，然后允许我晚上独自一人进到骑士的房间。”"
"So the lady consented; but meanwhile the auld wife had prepared a sleeping-drink, and given it to the knight, wha drank it, and never wakened till next morning.","大女儿同意了这个交易，但是老妇人事先准备了安眠药给骑士，一旦喝下这种安眠药，就会一直昏睡到第二天早上。"
"The lee-lang night ther damosel sabbed and sang:","在那个漫长的夜晚，少女哭着唱道："
"“Seven lang years I served for thee,","“为了你，七年来我拼命把活干，"
"The glassy hill I clamb for thee,","为了你，我爬过玻璃山，"

"She then brak the pear, and found it filled wi’ jewelry far richer than the contents o’ the apple.","于是她切开了那个梨子，发现里面满是比苹果里更昂贵的珠宝。"

"“Seven lang years I served for thee,” &c.","“为了你，七年来我拼命把活干，为了你，我翻过玻璃山，为了你，我洗净沾满血渍的衬衫，你为何不醒来把我看？”"
"Still he sleepit, and she nearly lost hope a’thegither.","他仍然睡着，她几乎绝望了。"
"But that day when he was out at the hunting, somebody asked him what noise and moaning was yon they heard all last night in his bedchamber.","第二天骑士出去打猎的时候，有人告诉他，昨天夜里从他房间一直传出呜咽声。"
"He said he heardna ony noise.","他说他什么都没听到。"
"But they assured him there was sae; and he resolved to keep waking that night to try what he could hear.","但他们向骑士保证确有其事，骑士决心在夜里保持清醒，看看他能听到什么。"
"That being the third night, and the damosel being between hope and despair, she brak her plum, and it held far the richest jewelry of the three.","那是第三晚，少女又憧憬又绝望，她切开了那只李子，里面的珠宝是三个里最昂贵的。"
"She bargained as before; and the auld wife, as before, took in the sleeping-drink to the young knight’s chamber; but he telled her he couldna drink it that night without sweetening.","她像之前一样请求，老妇人也像之前一样，拿着安眠药去了骑士的房间，但骑士告诉老妇人，他需要一些甜的东西才能把它喝下去。"
"And when she gaed awa’ for some honey to sweeten it wi’, he poured out the drink, and sae made the auld wife think he had drunk it.","趁老妇人去拿蜂蜜的时候，骑士倒掉了药，让老妇人以为他已经喝下去了。"
"They a’ went to bed again, and the damosel began, as before, singing:","大家都睡觉了，像之前一样，少女又开始唱歌："
"“Seven lang years I served for thee,","“为了你，七年来我拼命把活干，"
"The glassy hill I clamb for thee,","为了你，我爬过玻璃山，"
"The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee;","为了你，我洗净满是血渍的衬衫，"
"And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me?”","你为何不醒来把我看？”"
"He heard, and turned to her.","骑士听了便转过身来。"
