"A Mother of Monsters","怪物之母"
"by Guy de Maupassant","作者：莫泊桑"
"I recalled this horrible story, the events of which occurred long ago, and this horrible woman, the other day at a fashionable seaside resort, where I saw on the beach a well-known young, elegant and charming Parisienne, adored and respected by everyone.","前几天，我在一个富人们常去的海滨胜地的沙滩上，看到了一位年轻漂亮、举止优雅、颇有名气的巴黎妇人，所有人都崇拜敬仰她，这不禁让我想到了很久以前发生的一个恐怖的故事和那个恐怖的女人。"
"I had been invited by a friend to pay him a visit in a little provincial town.","我曾经应邀到外省的一个小镇上的朋友家去住过几天。"
"He took me about in all directions to do the honors of the place, showed me noted scenes, chateaux, industries, ruins.","为尽地主之谊，他带我到处逛了逛，我们看了些负有盛名的风景、古堡、工厂和废墟。"
"He pointed out monuments, churches, old carved doorways, enormous or distorted trees, the oak of St. Andrew, and the yew tree of Roqueboise.","他指给我看了一些纪念碑、教堂、古老的雕花大门、高大雄伟或者奇形怪状的树，如圣安德鲁的橡树和罗克布瓦斯的紫杉。"
"When I had exhausted my admiration and enthusiasm over all the sights, my friend said with a distressed expression on his face, that there was nothing left to look at.","当我对所有的名胜古迹用尽了自己的赞美和热情之后，我的朋友一脸沮丧地告诉我说，剩下就没什么可看的了。"
"I breathed freely.","我倒长长地舒了口气。"
"I would now be able to rest under the shade of the trees.","我总算可以在树阴下歇息会儿了。"
"But, all at once, he uttered an exclamation:","但是，他突然叫了一声："
"“Oh, yes!","“啊，对了！"
"We have the ‘Mother of Monsters’; I must take you to see her.”","我们这儿有一位‘怪物之母’，我必须带你去看看。”"
"“Who is that, the ‘Mother of Monsters’?” I asked.","“‘怪物之母’是谁？”我问道。"
"“She is an abominable woman,” he replied, “a regular demon, a being who voluntarily brings into the world deformed, hideous, frightful children, monstrosities, in fact, and then sells them to showmen who exhibit such things.","“她是一个令人恶心的女人，”他回答道，“是一个彻彻底底的魔鬼，她每年都故意生一些畸形、难看、吓人的孩子，简直就是一些妖怪，然后拿来卖给那些走江湖玩杂耍的人。"
"“These exploiters of freaks come from time to time to find out if she has any fresh monstrosity, and if it meets with their approval they carry it away with them, paying the mother a compensation.","“那些到处收罗怪物的人时不时地到她家去看看她有没有制造出新的怪物来，如果有看中的，就付给她一笔报酬，然后把那怪物带走。"
"“She has eleven of this description.","“她现在有了十一个这样的怪物。"
"She is rich.","她可发财了。"
"“You think I am joking, romancing, exaggerating.","“你觉得我是在说笑，在编故事，在夸大其辞。"
"No, my friend; I am telling you the truth, the exact truth.","不，朋友；我说的是实话，千真万确。"
"“Let us go and see this woman.","“我们先去看看这个女人。"
"Then I will tell you her history.”","然后我再告诉你她的故事。”"
"He took me into one of the suburbs.","他把我领到了郊外。"
"The woman lived in a pretty little house by the side of the road.","那女人住在路旁的一所漂亮的小房子里。"
"It was attractive and well kept.","房子很漂亮，打理得也很好。"
"The garden was filled with fragrant flowers.","花园里开满了鲜花，香气扑鼻。"
"One might have supposed it to be the residence of a retired lawyer.","谁见了都会以为是一个退休律师的住宅。"
"A maid ushered us into a sort of little country parlor, and the wretch appeared.","一个女仆把我们领到了一间带有乡村风格的小客厅，然后那个卑鄙的人就出来了。"
"She was about forty.","她约摸四十来岁。"
"She was a tall, big woman with hard features, but well formed, vigorous and healthy, the true type of a robust peasant woman, half animal, and half woman.","她是那种健壮的乡下女人的典型：大高个，但体格很好，健康、壮硕，一半像人，一半像牲口。"
"She was aware of her reputation and received everyone with a humility that smacked of hatred.","她知道自己的名声不好，所以接待客人的时候总是带着一种压抑着愤怒的卑躬屈膝的态度。"
"“What do the gentlemen wish?” she asked.","她问我们：“两位有什么事？”"
"“They tell me that your last child is just like an ordinary child, that he does not resemble his brothers at all,” replied my friend.","“听说你最小的一个孩子长得跟正常人一样，一点儿不像他那几个哥哥。”我朋友答道，"
"“I wanted to be sure of that.","“我想来确认一下。"
"Is it true?”","是真的吗？”"
"She cast on us a malicious and furious look as she said:","她用恶毒而愤怒的眼光瞧了我们一下，说道："
"“Oh, no, oh, no, my poor sir!","“哦，不，哦，不，我可怜的先生！"
"He is perhaps even uglier than the rest.","他比那几个或许更难看呢。"
"I have no luck, no luck!","我运气太坏了，太坏了！"
"“They are all like that, it is heartbreaking!","“他们全都是那样的，这真叫人伤心！"
"How can the good God be so hard on a poor woman who is all alone in the world, how can He?” She spoke hurriedly, her eyes cast down, with a deprecating air as of a wild beast who is afraid.","大慈大悲的上帝怎么能对一个在这个世界上孤苦伶仃地生活的女人如此狠心呢？他怎么能这样？”她说得很快，低着头，她假心假意的控诉显得她就像一头受惊的野兽。"
"Her harsh voice became soft, and it seemed strange to hear those tearful falsetto tones issuing from that big, bony frame, of unusual strength and with coarse outlines, which seemed fitted for violent action, and made to utter howls like a wolf.","她把她刺耳的嗓音尽量变得温和，但是听见那带着哭腔的声音从她那样高大魁梧、骨骼强健、身强力壮和粗野的躯体轮廓中发出来的时候，真叫人吃了一惊，因为那身体似乎是为做出粗暴的举动和发出像狼一样的嚎叫而生的。"
"“We should like to see your little one,” said my friend.","我的朋友提出了要求：“我们想看看你那个最小的孩子。”"
"I fancied she colored up. I may have been deceived.","我觉得她的脸色好像变了，或许是我弄错了。"
"After a few moments of silence, she said in a louder tone:","她沉默了一会儿，提高了嗓音说道："
"“What good will that do you?”","“这对于你们有什么好处？”"
"“Why do you not wish to show it to us?” replied my friend.","“为什么你不愿把他给我们看？”我的朋友反问道，"
"“There are many people to whom you will show it; you know whom I mean.”","“你会把他给很多人看，你知道我指的是哪些人。”"
"She gave a start, and resuming her natural voice, and giving free play to her anger, she screamed:","她跳了起来，放开了嗓门，肆意地发泄着她的怒火，她尖叫道："
"“Was that why you came here?","“你们就是为了这个来的？"
"To insult me?","为了来侮辱我？"
"Because my children are like animals, tell me?","因为我的孩子长得像畜生，对不对？"
"You shall not see him, no, no, you shall not see him!","我不会让你们看到他的，不，不，我不会让你们看到他的！"
"Go away, go away!","滚，滚！"
"I do not know why you all try to torment me like that.”","我不知道为什么你们都要这样折磨我。”"
"She walked over toward us, her hands on her hips.","她双手叉腰，向我们逼过来。"
"At the brutal tone of her voice, a sort of moaning, or rather a mewing, the lamentable cry of an idiot, came from the adjoining room.","透过她粗暴的叫声，我们听到一种呻吟，或者不如说是一种猫叫声，或者是傻子的哀号，这声音从隔壁的屋子里传过来。"
"I shivered to the marrow of my bones.","我吓得浑身直哆嗦。"
"We retreated before her.","我们在她面前一步步往后退。"
"“Take care, Devil” (they called her the Devil); said my friend, “take care; some day you will get yourself into trouble through this.”","我的朋友厉声说道：“当心点儿吧，你个恶魔（他们都叫她恶魔），你当心点儿，总有一天你会遭报应的。”"
"She began to tremble, beside herself with fury, shaking her fist and roaring:","她气得浑身发抖，挥着拳头咆哮道："
"“Be off with you!","“你们给我滚！"
"What will get me into trouble?","我会为什么事遭报应？"
"Be off with you, miscreants!”","你们给我滚，一群混账东西！”"
"She was about to attack us, but we fled, saddened at what we had seen.","眼看她要向我们扑过来，我们就逃了出来，看到的那些场景让人心里憋屈得很。"
"When we got outside, my friend said:","我们一走出来，我的朋友就问我："
"“Well, you have seen her, what do you think of her?”","“好吧，你看到了这人，你觉得她怎么样？”"
"“Tell me the story of this brute,” I replied.","“告诉我关于这个畜生的故事。”我回应道。"
"And this is what he told me as we walked along the white high road, with ripe crops on either side of it which rippled like the sea in the light breeze that passed over them.","当时我们沿着白色的大路往市区走去，路的两边是成熟的庄稼，微风吹过，如海面上泛起的阵阵涟漪，我的朋友告诉了我这样一个故事："
"“This woman was one a servant on a farm.","“这个女人是一个农场里的女工。"
"She was an honest girl, steady and economical.","她为人诚实，做事踏实，生活节俭。"
"She was never known to have an admirer, and never suspected of any frailty.","谁都不知道她是否有什么情人，谁都没想过她会有什么弱点。"
"But she went astray, as so many do.","但是她还是走向了堕落，就像很多人一样。"
"“She soon found herself in trouble, and was tortured with fear and shame.","“很快，她发现自己怀孕了，她因觉得害怕和羞辱而备受煎熬。"
"Wishing to conceal her misfortune, she bound her body tightly with a corset of her own invention, made of boards and cord.","为了不让别人发现她有了孩子，她就自己用木板和布带做成了紧身衣，紧紧地把自己捆着。"
"The more she developed, the more she bound herself with this instrument of torture, suffering martyrdom, but brave in her sorrow, not allowing anyone to see, or suspect, anything.","她的肚子越变越大，她就用这种工具把自己绑得越紧，虽然痛不欲生，但是她都在悲伤中勇敢地挺过来了，她绝不能让任何人看到，绝不能让他们有任何的猜想。"
"She maimed the little unborn being, cramping it with that frightful corset, and made a monster of it.","她就用那恐怖的紧身衣把还未出世的孩子给勒残废了，然后就生出了一个怪物。"
"Its head was squeezed and elongated to a point, and its large eyes seemed popping out of its head.","他的头被挤压成尖长型，两只大眼睛从额头上突出来。"
"Its limbs, exaggeratedly long, and twisted like the stalk of a vine, terminated in fingers like the claws of a spider.","他的四肢长得夸张，就像藤蔓一样扭曲，在藤蔓的末端，长着像蜘蛛的脚一样的指头．"
"Its trunk was tiny, and round as a nut.","他的身子很小，就像核桃一样圆圆的。"
"“The child was born in an open field, and when the weeders saw it, they fled away, screaming, and the report spread that she had given birth to a demon.","“这个孩子就在田野里出生了，除草的人发现了他，尖叫着跑开了，这个消息就这样传开了，说她生了一个恶魔。"
"From that time on, she was called ‘the Devil.’","从那以后，她就被叫做‘魔鬼’。"
"“She was driven from the farm, and lived on charity, under a cloud.","“她被赶出了农场，靠救济生存，生活一片昏暗。"
"She brought up the monster, whom she hated with a savage hatred, and would have strangled, perhaps, if the priest had not threatened her with arrest.","她把那个怪物抚养长大了，却很恨他，带着一种野蛮的仇恨，如果不是神父怕她犯罪，用逮捕来威胁她，说不定，她早把他掐死了。"
"“One day some travelling showmen heard about the frightful creature, and asked to see it, so that if it pleased them they might take it away.","“一天，几个走江湖的卖艺人听说了这个吓人的怪物，就要求去看看，如果他们中意的话，就把他带走。"
"They were pleased, and counted out five hundred francs to the mother.","结果，他们非常满意，就付给那母亲500法郎。"
"At first, she had refused to let them see the little animal, as she was ashamed; but when she discovered it had a money value, and that these people were anxious to get it, she began to haggle with them, raising her price with all a peasant’s persistence.","起初，她因为觉得羞愧，不让那些人看那个怪物，但后来她发现有钱可挣，那些人也急切地想带走他，她就开始跟他们讨价还价，她以一个庄稼人的执著抬高了价格。"
"“She made them draw up a paper, in which they promised to pay her four hundred francs a year besides, as though they had taken this deformity into their employ.","“她还让他们签了合同，合同规定他们每年额外地付给她400法郎，就好像那个畸形的孩子已经在为他们工作似的。"
"“Incited by the greed of gain, she continued to produce these phenomena, so as to have an assured income like a bourgeoise.","“这笔意外之财使她发了狂，她继续生出了这样一些怪物，以便能像一个中产阶级的妇人一样收入有保障。"
"“Some of them were long, some short, some like crabs-all bodies-others like lizards.","“有些孩子长得长，有些孩子长得短，有些全身看起来像螃蟹，有些长得像蜥蜴。"
"Several died, and she was heartbroken.","有些死了，这着实让她伤心了一阵。"
"“The law tried to interfere, but as they had no proof they let her continue to produce her freaks.","“司法机关设法干涉，但是他们没有确凿的证据，只能让她继续生产着她的怪物。"
"“She has at this moment eleven alive, and they bring in, on an average, counting good and bad years, from five to six thousand francs a year.","“她目前已经有了11个这样的孩子，无论好坏，他们平均每年可以给她带来五六千法郎的进账。"
"One, alone, is not placed, the one she was unwilling to show us. But she will not keep it long, for she is known to all the showmen in the world, who come from time to time to see if she has anything new.","还有一个没有安排，就是她不愿意给我们看的那个。不过她不会长留他，因为全世界的跑江湖的人都认识她，他们时不时地到这儿来看看，看看她有没有生出什么新玩意儿。"
"“She even gets bids from them when the monster is valuable.”","“当她生出的怪物值得讨价还价的时候，她甚至让他们竞价投标。”"
"My friend was silent.","我的朋友不说话了。"
"A profound disgust stirred my heart, and a feeling of rage, of regret, to think that I had not strangled this brute when I had the opportunity.","一阵深深的恶心感在我心里翻滚，我很愤怒，真后悔刚刚遇见她的时候没把她给掐死。"
"I had forgotten this story, when I saw on the beach of a fashionable resort the other day, an elegant, charming, dainty woman, surrounded by men who paid her respect as well as admiration.","前几天，我在一个有钱人常去的海滨看到一位优雅、迷人、讲究的妇人被一群敬仰她的男人围着的时候，我并没有想起这个故事。"
"I was walking along the beach, arm in arm with a friend, the resident physician.","当时，我正和当地的一位医生朋友手挽手沿着沙滩散步。"
"Ten minutes later, I saw a nursemaid with three children, who were rolling in the sand.","十分钟后，我看到一个保姆和三个在沙滩上打滚的小孩．"
"A pair of little crutches lay on the ground, and touched my sympathy.","一副放在地上的小拐杖，让我感到一阵同情。"
"I then noticed that these three children were all deformed, humpbacked, or crooked; and hideous.","接着，我发现那三个孩子都长得很畸形、驼背，或者身材变形，丑陋不堪。"
"“Those are the offspring of that charming woman you saw just now,” said the doctor.","“这些就是你刚刚看到的那个迷人的妇女的孩子。”那个医生说道。"
"I was filled with pity for her, as well as for them, and exclaimed: “Oh, the poor mother!","我对她和她的孩子们深表同情，感叹道：“哦，可怜的母亲！"
"How can she ever laugh!”","她怎么还能笑得出来！”"
"“Do not pity her, my friend.","“朋友，不必可怜她。"
"Pity the poor children,” replied the doctor.","应该可怜的是这些孩子们，”医生接着说道，"
"“This is the consequence of preserving a slender figure up to the last.","“这就是为了直到临产还要保持苗条身段的结果。"
"These little deformities were made by the corset.","这些孩子都是被紧身衣给绑得畸形的。"
"She knows very well that she is risking her life at this game.","她明明知道这样做是在冒着生命危险。"
"But what does she care, as long as he can be beautiful and have admirers!”","但她才不管呢，只要她看起来漂亮迷人就行了！”"
"And then I recalled that other woman, the peasant, the “Devil,” who sold her children, her monsters.","然后，我就想起了那个乡下女人，那个出售她长得像怪物的孩子的“魔鬼”。"
