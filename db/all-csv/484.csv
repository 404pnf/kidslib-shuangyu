"钟的传记","A Bell’s Biography"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"仔细听听我们这位长着铁舌头的邻居说了什么吧。我坐在那里看着一大页书写纸沉思的时候，他气势如虹地通报时间，声音大得全镇人都能听见。尽管，毫无疑问,他肯定只是想温和地提醒我赶紧开始为他写传记，别再继续浪费这个晚上了。当然，这样一位身处高位，又能在世上发出如此巨大声音的名流，是完全有权要求传记家为他服务的。在他数不胜数的家族成员中，他是最具代表性、也是最卓越的一位。这个家族的特征是舌头，而他们的唯一使命就是靠大声呐喊来为公众服务。在我们这个由舌头统治的民主社会里，他的任何一位喧闹的同胞倘若羡慕我赋予他的优越地位，他们大可以把自己挂得和他一样高，我完全没有异议。说到他的历史，请读者不要担心我只会空洞地重复他那叮当的钟声。在这美妙的兴衰变幻中，他是个消极被动的主人公，我偶然间了解了这些变迁，或许就是从他自己的口中得知的；那些粗心大意的人们却以为他只是在报告当天的时间，提醒他们去吃饭或上教堂，或催促瞌睡的人上床睡觉，或让垂死的人进入坟墓。他命中注定要经历很多次革命，而且始终如一地会发出震耳欲聋的响声。无论他是否把自己的回忆告诉了我，至少有一点是可以肯定的：我越是研究他那浑厚低沉的话语，我就越能在其中发现更多的智慧、情感和灵魂。","Hearken to our neighbor with the iron tongue.While I sit musing over my sheet of foolscap, he emphatically tells the hour, in tones loud enough for all the town to hear, though doubtless intended only as a gentle hint to myself, that I may begin his biography before the evening shall be further wasted.Unquestionably, a personage in such an elevated position, and making so great a noise in the world, has a fair claim to the services of a biographer.He is the representative and most illustrious member of that innumerable class, whose characteristic feature is the tongue, and whose sole business, to clamor for the public good.If any of his noisy brethren, in our tongue-governed democracy, be envious of the superiority which I have assigned him, they have my free consent to hang themselves as high as he.And, for his history, let not the reader apprehend an empty repetition of ding-dong-bell.He has been the passive hero of wonderful vicissitudes, with which I have chanced to become acquainted, possibly from his own mouth; while the careless multitude supposed him to be talking merely of the time of day, or calling them to dinner or to church, or bidding drowsy people go bedward, or the dead to their graves.Many a revolution has it been his fate to go through, and invariably with a prodigious uproar.And whether or no he have told me his reminiscences, this at least is true, that the more I study his deep-toned language, the more sense, and sentiment, and soul, do I discover in it."
"这只钟——因为我们不必再使用有趣的拟人化称谓了——是一只原产自法国的古董钟，钟上的十字形符号表明它本应悬挂在一座天主教的教堂之上。住在这一带的老人有个传说，说铸造这只钟的大部分金属来自一门铜大炮，那是路易十四在一次完胜西班牙人的战役中得来的战利品，波旁王朝的一位公主还把她的金十字架扔进了那团熔化的金属里。他们还说，一位主教还给这口钟进行了洗礼和祈福，祈求它的钟声能给人们带来天堂的感应。所有仪式举行完毕之后，伟大的君主便把它作为礼物赠给了耶稣会——还有什么能比它更响亮地传播耶稣的善行呢——当时耶稣会正在说服美国印第安人改变信仰，皈依教皇。于是这只钟——就是我们说的这只钟，我们在街上时刻能听见它熟悉的声音——就是这只钟被悬挂在了一座圆木搭建的小教堂的塔楼上，教堂位于尚普兰湖的西侧，浩瀚的圣劳伦斯河附近。它就是在这里敲响了自己的第一下钟声。这座小教堂被称为“森林圣母教堂”。钟声阵阵，仿佛要拯救那片未开化的荒野，让它变得圣洁。在灌木丛中秘密潜行的狼听到钟声后发出阵阵咆哮；令人生畏的熊转过身，阴沉着脸一声不响地走开了；受惊的母鹿跳了起来，把它的孩子带去了更僻静的地方。印第安人不禁好奇：那风中是什么可怕的声音咆哮着穿过树梢。于是，他们虔诚地回应它的召唤。当他们走近那座顶上竖立着十字架的小教堂时，穿黑袍的神父为他们祝福。很快，每个黑黝黝的胸膛上都挂着一个十字架。印第安人跪在低矮的屋檐下做礼拜，就像在圣彼得大教堂的巨大穹顶下，教皇在君王们面前做大弥撒的情景一样。每逢宗教节日，高耸的大教堂就钟声齐鸣，森林圣母教堂的钟声也会随之响起来。每当巴黎市民走上街头庆祝波旁国王的生辰，或是法国在欧洲的某个战场上打了胜仗时，荒野的钟声就会高声响起，欢庆地为之伴奏。这里时常会举行某个印第安酋长的葬礼。每当此时，忧伤的丧钟就会响起，连肃穆的森林也会为之悲伤，就像厚厚堆积的落叶会从这块处女地上被清扫掉一样频繁。","This bell—for we may as well drop our quaint personification—is of antique French manufacture, and the symbol of the cross betokens that it was meant to be suspended in the belfry of a Romish place of worship.The old people hereabout have a tradition, that a considerable part of the metal was supplied by a brass cannon, captured in one of the victories of Louis the Fourteenth over the Spaniards, and that a Bourbon princess threw her golden crucifix into the molten mass.It is said, likewise, that a bishop baptized and blessed the bell, and prayed that a heavenly influence might mingle with its tones.When all due ceremonies had been performed, the Grand Monarque bestowed the gift—than which none could resound his beneficence more loudly—on the Jesuits, who were then converting the American Indians to the spiritual dominion of the Pope.So the bell,—our self-same bell, whose familiar voice we may hear at all hours, in the streets,—this very bell sent forth its first-born accents from the tower of a log-built chapel, westward of Lake Champlain, and near the mighty stream of the St. Lawrence.It was called Our Lady’s Chapel of the Forest.The peal went forth as if to redeem and consecrate the heathen wilderness.The wolf growled at the sound, as he prowled stealthily through the underbrush; the grim bear turned his back, and stalked sullenly away; the startled doe leaped up, and led her fawn into a deeper solitude.The red men wondered what awful voice was speaking amid the wind that roared through the tree-tops; and, following reverentially its summons, the dark-robed fathers blessed them, as they drew near the cross-crowned chapel.In a little time, there was a crucifix on every dusky bosom.The Indians knelt beneath the lowly roof, worshipping in the same forms that were observed under the vast dome of St. Peter’s, when the Pope performed high mass in the presence of kneeling princes.All the religious festivals, that awoke the chiming bells of lofty cathedrals, called forth a peal from Our Lady’s Chapel of the Forest.Loudly rang the bell of the wilderness while the streets of Paris echoed with rejoicings for the birthday of the Bourbon, or whenever France had triumphed on some European battle-field.And the solemn woods were saddened with a melancholy knell, as often as the thick-strewn leaves were swept away from the virgin soil, for the burial of an Indian chief."
"同时，每逢安息日和布道日，在波士顿和其他信仰清教的小镇，那些怀有敌意和敌对信仰的人也敲响了大钟。它们的回声消失在圣母教堂东南面几百英里外的地方。但是，侦察兵穿过横亘在两地中间的无路可通的沙漠，躲在巨大的树干后面仔细观察，发现印第安人一听到钟声的召唤就会聚集到一起。有的人腰间还挂着头皮，上面还长着亚麻色的头发，好像要把这些血腥的战利品供到圣母的神坛前。据说罗马教皇和法国国王在森林里修建这座小教堂是为了鼓动印第安人发动一场对英国移民的讨伐战。整个新英格兰都流传着这一说法，人们也对此深信不疑。英国移民采取了有力措施，捍卫他们的宗教和生命。在天主教会特殊斋戒日的前夜，当低沉的钟声响起，神父们吟唱起悲哀的诗句时，一支新英格兰突击队从周围的丛林里冲了出来。小教堂里顿时陷入一片惨烈的喊叫声和火枪的噼啪声中。主持仪式的神父们扑倒在圣坛前，但还是被杀死在圣坛的台阶上。如果像古老传说所讲述的，殉难者鲜血染红的地方会寸草不生的话，那么直到今天，那个被亵渎了的圣坛周围都会是一片光秃秃的荒地。","Meantime, the bells of a hostile people and a hostile faith were ringing on Sabbaths and lecture-days, at Boston and other Puritan towns.Their echoes died away hundreds of miles southeastward of Our Lady’s Chapel.But scouts had threaded the pathless desert that lay between, and, from behind the huge tree-trunks, perceived the Indians assembling at the summons of the bell.Some bore flaxen-haired scalps at their girdles, as if to lay those bloody trophies on Our Lady’s altar.It was reported, and believed, all through New England, that the Pope of Rome, and the King of France, had established this little chapel in the forest, for the purpose of stirring up the red men to a crusade against the English settlers.The latter took energetic measures to secure their religion and their lives.On the eve of an especial fast of the Romish Church, while the bell tolled dismally, and the priests were chanting a doleful stave, a band of New England rangers rushed from the surrounding woods.Fierce shouts, and the report of musketry, pealed suddenly within the chapel.The ministering priests threw themselves before the altar, and were slain even on its steps.If, as antique traditions tell us, no grass will grow where the blood of martyrs has been shed, there should be a barren spot, to this very day, on the site of that desecrated altar."
"鲜血还在沿着一级级台阶流淌，突击队的首领抓起一支火把，点燃了神龛的帷幔。火焰和烟雾升起，好似火祭一般，照亮了教堂的同时，也让教堂的整个内部变得模糊不清——时而将死去的神父们掩藏在黑色的尸衣中，时而又用一阵巨大的火光照亮这些死者以及屠杀他们的凶手。有的人已经开始祈祷，希望圣坛上的浓烟会遮盖这场屠杀，不让上帝看见。但其中一名突击队员——看上去面容圣洁，实则双手沾满了鲜血——走到了队长面前。","While the blood was still plashing from step to step, the leader of the rangers seized a torch, and applied it to the drapery of the shrine.The flame and smoke arose, as from a burnt-sacrifice, at once illuminating and obscuring the whole interior of the chapel,—now hiding the dead priests in a sable shroud, now revealing them and their slayers in one terrific glare.Some already wished that the altar-smoke could cover the deed from the sight of Heaven.But one of the rangers—a man of sanctified aspect, though his hands were bloody—approached the captain."
"“先生，”他说道，“我们村的礼拜堂正好缺一口钟，一直以来，我们都只得靠击鼓来召集善良的人们去做礼拜。我请求您，看在虔诚的罗杰斯先生的份上，把这口天主教的钟赐给我。自我们开始行军以来，他肯定是在礼拜会上为我们祈了福。谁知道我们今晚的大获全胜是这位圣人在上帝面前争取了多久的结果呢？”","“Sir,” said he, “our village meeting-house lacks a bell, and hitherto we have been fain to summon the good people to worship by beat of drum.Give me, I pray you, the bell of this popish chapel, for the sake of the godly Mr. Rogers, who doubtless hath remembered us in the prayers of the congregation, ever since we began our march.Who can tell what share of this night’s good success we owe to that holy man’s wrestling with the Lord?”"
"“唔，那么，”队长答道，“如果善良的罗杰斯先生果真帮了我们的忙，那么战利品也该算他一份。把钟拿去吧，不用客气，劳森执事，只要你不嫌搬回家麻烦。在此之前，它一直说着天主教那套语言，而且还是法语或含混不清的印第安语。不过，我敢保证，如果罗杰斯先生重新圣化它，它一定会好好说话的，就像其他规规矩矩的英国新教钟那样。”","“Nay, then,” answered the captain, “if good Mr. Rogers hath holpen our enterprise, it is right that he should share the spoil.Take the bell and welcome, Deacon Lawson, if you will be at the trouble of carrying it home.Hitherto it hath spoken nothing but papistry, and that too in the French or Indian gibberish; but I warrant me, if Mr. Rogers consecrate it anew, it will talk like a good English and Protestant bell.”"
"于是，劳森执事和十个同镇的老乡一起卸下那口钟，把它系在一根长杆上，用强壮的肩膀扛着它走了。他们打算把它搬到尚普兰湖边，再从水路把它运回家去。透过树林，远远地就能看到圣母教堂的熊熊火焰在成簇的叶子下投射出奇形怪状的影子，在从未被阳光照耀过的溪水上闪烁。当突击队员们肩负着沉重的担子，蹒跚着穿过午夜时的森林时，钟的舌簧多次发出巨大的撞击声——当，当，当！——钟声极度忧伤悲戚，仿佛是在为被屠杀的神父们和被烧毁的小教堂敲响丧钟。劳森执事和他的镇民们根本没有想到，这会是他们自己的丧钟。一队印第安武士听见了火枪声，看见了教堂的火光，现在正跟在突击队后面；他们在这钟声的悲伤低语的召唤下，聚到一起，前去复仇。在一片很深的沼泽地中，他们突袭了正在撤退的敌人。优秀的劳森执事进行了激烈的反抗，但还是被一斧头劈开了脑袋，倒在了泥淖里，那只沉重的钟压在了他的身上。此后许多年里，无论是在做礼拜的时候，还是在节日庆典或葬礼上，我们都再也听不见这位主人公的声音了。","So Deacon Lawson and half a score of his townsmen took down the bell, suspended it on a pole, and bore it away on their sturdy shoulders, meaning to carry it to the shore of Lake Champlain, and thence homeward by water.Far through the woods gleamed the flames of Our Lady’s Chapel, flinging fantastic shadows from the clustered foliage, and glancing on brooks that had never caught the sunlight.As the rangers traversed the midnight forest, staggering under their heavy burden, the tongue of the bell gave many a tremendous stroke,—clang, clang, clang!—a most doleful sound, as if it were tolling for the slaughter of the priests and the ruin of the chapel.Little dreamed Deacon Lawson and his townsmen that it was their own funeral knell.A war-party of Indians had heard the report of musketry, and seen the blaze of the chapel, and now were on the track of the rangers, summoned to vengeance by the bell’s dismal murmurs.In the midst of a deep swamp, they made a sudden onset on the retreating foe.Good Deacon Lawson battled stoutly, but had his skull cloven by a tomahawk, and sank into the depths of the morass, with the ponderous bell above him.And, for many a year thereafter, our hero’s voice was heard no more on earth, neither at the hour of worship, nor at festivals nor funerals."
"他是否依旧被埋葬在那无名的坟墓里？绝不会这样的，亲爱的读者。听！此时此刻我们都能清楚地听见他的声音。这位时间的发言人正在宣布现在的时间——晚上九点！因此，我们大可得出一个结论：某种机缘巧合，让他重新回到了高空。","And is he still buried in that unknown grave?Scarcely so, dear reader.Hark!How plainly we hear him at this moment, the spokesman of Time, proclaiming that it is nine o’clock at night!We may therefore safely conclude that some happy chance has restored him to upper air."
"但是，那只钟已静静地在地下躺了许多年。令人惊奇的是，它并没有在那里躺上一个世纪或是十几个世纪，直到人们可能不仅忘了它的声音，也忘了整个钟家族的声音。当救活它的人听到它那铁舌头发出的第一个音符时，他们该有多吃惊啊！但它命中注定不会成为未来考古学家讨论的话题。乔治国王战争即将结束时，在布拉德斯特里特上校的队伍前往安大略湖之前，有一队新英格兰伐木工人正在一片沼泽中建造一座木桥。其中一个伐木工人打下一段桩子，感觉它碰上了一样坚硬平滑的东西。他叫来同伴，在他们的共同努力下，钟的顶部终于露出了地面；他们在钟上牢牢地系上一根绳子，然后把绳子套在一根横着的树枝上。使劲拉啊！他们把战利品拽了上来，它还滴着水，上面挂满了嫩绿的水草。拓荒者们把钟的底部从沼泽里抬出来的时候，发现一具骷髅用只剩下枯骨的手指紧紧攥着钟舌，但是钟一被抬起，它就立刻无力地放开手，重新陷入了死水中。随后，那只钟发出了一声阴沉的响声。怪不得它急着要说话，它都已经沉默这么久了！拓荒者们使劲摇晃钟，使它响亮地轰鸣起来，钟声响遍整个森林，传到布拉德斯特里特上校和他的三千名士兵耳朵里。正在行进的士兵停了下来。一种宗教的情感融合着思乡之情深深打动了这群硬汉的心；每个人都仿佛听见了老教堂的钟声，他们从小就熟悉这钟声，它曾在他们所有祖辈的葬礼上敲响过。是什么样的魔力使这神圣的声音越过无边无际、流水潺潺的海洋，并在武器的碰撞声中，在大炮碾过崎岖不平的荒野小道时发出的轰隆声中，在狂风吹过树枝发出的阴郁的呼啸声中变得如此清晰？","But there lay the bell, for many silent years; and the wonder is, that he did not lie silent there a century, or perhaps a dozen centuries, till the world should have forgotten not only his voice, but the voices of the whole brotherhood of bells.How would the first accent of his iron tongue have startled his resurrectionists!But he was not fated to be a subject of discussion among the antiquaries of far posterity.Near the close of the Old French War, a party of New England axe-men, who preceded the march of Colonel Bradstreet toward Lake Ontario, were building a bridge of logs through a swamp.Plunging down a stake, one of these pioneers felt it graze against some hard, smooth substance.He called his comrades, and, by their united efforts, the top of the bell was raised to the surface, a rope made fast to it, and thence passed over the horizontal limb of a tree.Heave ho! up they hoisted their prize, dripping with moisture, and festooned with verdant water-moss.As the base of the bell emerged from the swamp, the pioneers perceived that a skeleton was clinging with its bony fingers to the clapper, but immediately relaxing its nerveless grasp, sank back into the stagnant water.The bell then gave forth a sullen clang.No wonder that he was in haste to speak, after holding his tongue for such a length of time!The pioneers shoved the bell to and fro, thus ringing a loud and heavy peal, which echoed widely through the forest, and reached the ears of Colonel Bradstreet, and his three thousand men.The soldiers paused on their march; a feeling of religion, mingled with borne-tenderness, overpowered their rude hearts; each seemed to hear the clangor of the old church-bell, which had been familiar to hint from infancy, and had tolled at the funerals of all his forefathers.By what magic had that holy sound strayed over the wide-murmuring ocean, and become audible amid the clash of arms, the loud crashing of the artillery over the rough wilderness-path, and the melancholy roar of the wind among the boughs?"
"新英格兰人把战利品藏在一个幽暗的隐蔽之处，在一块灰色巨石和一棵树的树根中间，这棵树已经倒下了，树根上沾满了泥土。行军结束之后，他们把这口钟运到了波士顿，在国王街的人行道上公开拍卖。它被暂时用滑车吊在了空中，晃来晃去，发出响亮而清脆的叮当声，充分证明了自己的价值，根本用不着拍卖人为其美言。出价最高的是我们镇上一位富有的老人。他虔诚地把钟赠予了礼拜堂；半个世纪以来他都在这所教堂做礼拜。这位善良的人得到了回报。钟被挂到教堂的钟楼上之后，第一次履行的职责便是为这位老人敲响葬礼的丧钟，这真是奇妙的巧合。不过，没多久，丧钟悲伤的回声便被庆祝魁北克投降的钟声淹没了。","The New–Englanders hid their prize in a shadowy nook, betwixt a large gray stone and the earthy roots of an overthrown tree; and when the campaign was ended, they conveyed our friend to Boston, and put him up at auction on the sidewalk of King Street.He was suspended, for the nonce, by a block and tackle, and being swung backward and forward, gave such loud and clear testimony to his own merits, that the auctioneer had no need to say a word.The highest bidder was a rich old representative from our town, who piously bestowed the bell on the meeting-house where he had been a worshipper for half a century.The good man had his reward.By a strange coincidence, the very first duty of the sexton, after the bell had been hoisted into the belfry, was to toll the funeral knell of the donor.Soon, however, those doleful echoes were drowned by a triumphant peal for the surrender of Quebec."
"从那个时期开始，我们的主人公就一直占据着那个崇高的位置，对所有国内、军事或宗教方面的重要公共事务都发表了自己的看法。当它俯视的那条街上传来美国宣布独立的消息时，它发出了一声鸣响。很多人认为这钟声里透着不详和的恐惧，而不是胜利的喜悦。不过，60年来，它一直讲述着同样的故事，现在再也没人会误解它的意思了。当华盛顿意气风发地走过洒满鲜花的街道时，是它用钟声为国父奏响迎宾曲！拉斐德前来接受人们对他50年丰功伟绩的感谢时，同样的钟声再次响起。同时，它俯视的世界也正在发生着巨变。它的声音曾经飘浮在偏狭的小海港的上空，如今却在砖瓦堆砌的大厦中回响，透过城市的嘈杂与喧嚣传入人们的耳中。在旧时的安息日那天，响应钟声召唤的是形形色色、别具一格的一群人：体面的绅士们穿着紫色天鹅绒大衣、刺绣马甲，带着白色假发和镶着金色花边的帽子，彬彬有礼地走在夫人小姐旁边。夫人小姐们则穿着大花缎子的长袍和带裙撑的衬裙。她们后面会跟着一个穿制服的奴隶或农奴，这人手里托着一本赞美诗或给女主人暖脚用的小炉子。在礼拜堂门口，衣着朴素的平民百姓总会让地位高的人先进去，仿佛承认即使在上帝眼里，人还是有贵贱之分的。然而，当他们的棺材一个接一个被抬过街道时，钟声为所有人敲响安魂曲。棺盖上有没有银制的纹章盾牌又有什么关系呢？“敞开您的胸怀吧，大地母亲！”钟声如是说，“您的又一个孩子即将长眠。把他拥入怀中，让他安息吧。”钟声如是说，于是大地母亲接纳了她的孩子。如今的一代人将在大钟同样的语调中被送到他们母亲的怀抱里，大地母亲也会一如既往地接受她的孩子。两个世纪以来，你的悲鸣没有停息，你的舌头是否已经疲倦？噢，丧钟啊！难道你就不会被自己悲伤的钟声所震撼吗？是的，一声号角能唤醒长眠的人，但是你沉重的钟声却再也不能叫醒他们了！","Ever since that period, our hero has occupied the same elevated station, and has put in his word on all matters of public importance, civil, military, or religious.On the day when Independence was first proclaimed in the street beneath, he uttered a peal which many deemed ominous and fearful, rather than triumphant.But he has told the same story these sixty years, and none mistake his meaning now.When Washington, in the fulness of his glory, rode through our flower-strewn streets, this was the tongue that bade the Father of his Country welcome!Again the same voice was heard, when La Fayette came to gather in his half-century’s harvest of gratitude.Meantime, vast changes have been going on below.His voice, which once floated over a little provincial seaport, is now reverberated between brick edifices, and strikes the ear amid the buzz and tumult of a city.On the Sabbaths of olden time, the summons of the bell was obeyed by a picturesque and varied throng; stately gentlemen in purple velvet coats, embroidered waistcoats, white wigs, and gold-laced hats, stepping with grave courtesy beside ladies in flowered satin gowns, and hoop-petticoats of majestic circumference; while behind followed a liveried slave or bondsman, bearing the psalm-book, and a stove for his mistress’s feet.The commonalty, clad in homely garb, gave precedence to their betters at the door of the meetinghouse, as if admitting that there were distinctions between them, even in the sight of God.Yet, as their coffins were borne one after another through the street, the bell has tolled a requiem for all alike.What mattered it, whether or no there were a silver scutcheon on the coffin-lid?“Open thy bosom, Mother Earth!”Thus spake the bell.“Another of thy children is coming to his long rest.Take him to thy bosom, and let him slumber in peace.”Thus spake the bell, and Mother Earth received her child.With the self-same tones will the present generation be ushered to the embraces of their mother; and Mother Earth will still receive her children.Is not thy tongue a weary, mournful talker of two centuries?O funeral bell! wilt thou never be shattered with thine own melancholy strokes?Yea, and a trumpet-call shall arouse the sleepers, whom thy heavy clang could awake no more!"
"一下——又一下，你的钟声提醒着我，我在浪费“午夜的灯油”。在我孤独的幻想里，我很难相信别人也听到了你的声音，很难相信这钟声除了在我隐秘的灵魂深处以外，还会在别的地方响起。但是，你对许多人倾诉过。焦躁的人们在无眠的枕边听见你的声音，又重新操心起明天的事来。每隔一小段时间便会失眠的辛劳的人们，听见你的声音说道：“难道我们安静的睡眠时间已经过去这么多了吗？——清晨就要来临了吗？”犯罪的人听见你的声音，喃喃自语：“时候到了！”绝望的人回答你：“这样令人厌倦的人生已经过了大半辈子！”年轻的母亲在她的床上悲喜交加地数着你回荡的钟声，计算着她第一个婴儿在世上的时光和身后的荣誉。新郎和新娘倾听着，感到他们的心醉神迷的夜晚好似梦一样飞逝而去。你的声音模模糊糊地传到垂死的人耳边，警告他说，下一次钟声敲响的时候，他的灵魂将会进入时间之声永远无法到达的地方。唉，为即将离去的人叹息吧，如果你的声音——那飞逝的时间之声——没有教会他永生的任何教训！","Again—again thy voice, reminding me that I am wasting the “midnight oil.”In my lonely fantasy, I can scarce believe that other mortals have caught the sound, or that it vibrates elsewhere than in my secret soul.But to many hast thou spoken.Anxious men have heard thee on their sleepless pillows, and bethought themselves anew of tomorrow’s care.In a brief interval of wakefulness, the sons of toil have heard thee, and say, “Is so much of our quiet slumber spent?—is the morning so near at hand?”Crime has heard thee, and mutters, “Now is the very hour!”Despair answers thee, “Thus much of this weary life is gone!”The young mother, on her bed of pain and ecstasy, has counted thy echoing strokes, and dates from them her first-born’s share of life and immortality.The bridegroom and the bride have listened, and feel that their night of rapture flits like a dream away.Thine accents have fallen faintly on the ear of the dying man, and warned him that, ere thou speakest again, his spirit shall have passed whither no voice of time can ever reach.Alas for the departing traveller, if thy voice—the voice of fleeting time—have taught him no lessons for Eternity!"
