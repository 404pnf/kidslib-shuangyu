"在帕多瓦的一个炎热的傍晚，他们把他抬到了屋顶上。他可以眺望到整个城镇的上方。天空中飞着些烟囱刺尾雨燕。过了一会儿，天黑了，探照灯亮了起来。其他人带着酒瓶下去了。他和卢芝可以听见他们在下面的阳台上。卢芝坐在床上。在炎热的夜晚，卢芝却感到凉快清爽。","One hot evening in Padua they carried him up onto the roof and he could look out over the top of the town.There were chimney swifts in the sky.After a while it got dark and the searchlights came out.The others went down and took the bottles with them.He and Luz could hear them below on the balcony.Luz sat on the bed.She was cool and fresh in the hot night."
"卢芝值了三个月的夜班。他们很乐意让她做。他们给他动手术的时候，她为他准备手术台；他们讲了一个“是朋友还是灌肠剂”的笑话。他虽打上了麻药，但还硬撑着，免得在失去知觉、话多的时候说漏了嘴。他用上拐杖后，就常常自己去量体温，这样卢芝就不用非得起床了。只有几个病人，他们都知道这件事。他们都喜欢卢芝。当他沿走廊走回去时，他一直想着在他床上的卢芝。","Luz stayed on night duty for three months.They were glad to let her.When they operated on him she prepared him for the operating table; and they had a joke about friend or enema.He went under the anesthetic holding tight on to himself so he would not blab about anything during the silly, talky time.After he got on crutches he used to take the temperatures so Luz would not have to get up from the bed.There were only a few patients and they all knew about it.They all liked Luz. As he walked back along the halls he thought of Luz in his bed."
"他回前线之前，他们去了大教堂祈祷。教堂里昏暗而且安静，还有些其他在祈祷的人。他们想结婚，但没有足够的时间让教堂公布结婚预告，而且他们两个都没有出生证。他们感觉好像结了婚似的，但他们想让所有人都知道这件事。把这事情办成，这样他们就不会让它泡汤了。","Before he went back to the front they went into the Duomo and prayed.It was dim and quiet, and there were other people praying.They wanted to get married, but there was not enough time for the banns, and neither of them had birth certificates.They felt as though they were married, but they wanted every one to know about it, and to make it so they could not lose it."
"卢芝给他写了好多封信，直到停战时他才收到。十五封信被扎成一捆寄到了前线。他按日期整理好，从头读到尾。信的内容都是关于医院的，还写着她是多么爱他，没有他她根本过不下去，以及她夜里是多么地思念他。","Luz wrote him many letters that he never got until after the armistice.Fifteen came in a bunch to the front and he sorted them by the dates and read them all straight through.They were all about the hospital, and how much she loved him and how it was impossible to get along without him and how terrible it was missing him at night."
"停战后，他们认为他该回国找份工作，这样他们就可以结婚了。除非他有了份好工作，可以来纽约接她了，卢芝才会回国。不用说，他不会去喝酒，也不想见国内的朋友或任何人。他只是想找份工作然后结婚。在从帕多瓦开往米兰的火车上，他们为她不愿意马上回国吵了架。在米兰车站不得不说再见的时候，他们吻别了，但争吵并未结束。他对这样说告别感到难过。","After the armistice they agreed he should go home to get a job so they might be married.Luz would not come home until he had a good job and could come to New York to meet her.It was understood he would not drink, and he did not want to see his friends or any one in the States.Only to get a job and be married.On the train from Padua to Milan they quarrelled about her not being willing to come home at once.When they had to say good-bye, in the station at Milan, they kissed good-bye, but were not finished with the quarrel.He felt sick about saying good-bye like that."
"他从热那亚乘船去了美国。卢芝回到波代诺内开了一家医院。那里偏僻多雨，有一营冲锋队驻扎在镇上。在这个泥泞多雨的城镇的冬天，营部少校向卢芝求爱了，而她从前根本不认识意大利人。最终，她写信到美国说他们的感情仅仅是少男少女之间的爱罢了。她很抱歉，知道他大概不能理解，但总有一天他可能会原谅她并感激她的。完全出人意料的是，她预定在春天结婚。她一如既往地爱着他，但是现在她意识到过去只是少男少女之间的爱而已。她希望他能有一番伟大的事业，而且完全相信他的能力。她知道这样是最好的了。","He went to America on a boat from Genoa.Luz went back to Pordenone to open a hospital.It was lonely and rainy there, and there was a battalion of arditi quartered in the town.Living in the muddy, rainy town in the winter, the major of the battalion made love to Luz, and she had never known Italians before, and finally wrote to the States that theirs had been only a boy and girl affair.She was sorry, and she knew he would probably not be able to understand, but might some day forgive her, and be grateful to her, and she expected, absolutely unexpectedly, to be married in the spring.She loved him as always, but she realized now it was only a boy and girl love.She hoped he would have a great career, and believed in him absolutely.She knew it was for the best."
"无论是那个春天，还是其他任何时候，少校都没有和她结婚。卢芝寄到芝加哥去的信也没有得到他的答复。不久之后，当他开着出租车经过林肯公园时，在闹市区一家百货商店的售货女郎那里染上了淋病。","The major did not marry her in the spring, or any other time.Luz never got an answer to the letter to Chicago about it.A short time after he contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl in a loop department store while riding in a taxicab through Lincoln Park."
