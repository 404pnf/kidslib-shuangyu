"Story of Wali Dad the Simple-Hearted","纯朴真诚的瓦利·戴德的故事"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there lived a poor old man whose name was Wali Dad Gunjay, or Wali Dad the Bald.","从前有一个贫穷的老人，他的名字叫瓦利·戴德·冈杰，又名秃头瓦利·戴德。"
"He had no relations, but lived all by himself in a little mud hut some distance from any town, and made his living by cutting grass in the jungle, and selling it as fodder for horses.","他没有亲戚，而是独自居住在离城镇有一段距离的一间小土屋里，靠割丛林里的草和把它作为马匹的草料出售为生。"
"He only earned by this five halfpence a day; but he was a simple old man, and needed so little out of it, that he saved up one halfpenny daily, and spent the rest upon such food and clothing as he required.","他只能一天靠它赚两个半便士。但是他是个简朴的老人，没什么奢求，他每天都能节省一个便士，把剩下的钱花费在他需要的食物和衣服上。"
"In this way he lived for many years until, one night, he thought that he would count the money he had hidden away in the great earthen pot under the floor of his hut.","他像这样生活了很多年，直到有一天夜晚，他想他应该数数他藏起来的钱了，那些钱就埋在小屋地底下的瓦罐里。"
"So he set to work, and with much trouble he pulled the bag out on to the floor, and sat gazing in astonishment at the heap of coins which tumbled out of it.","因此，他开始行动，费了好大的劲才把袋子拉到地面上来。他坐下来，惊奇地凝视着这堆从袋子里滚落出来的钱币。"
"What should he do with them all? he wondered.","他应该拿它们来做什么呢？他不知道。"
"But he never thought of spending the money on himself, because he was content to pass the rest of his days as he had been doing for ever so long, and he really had no desire for any greater comfort or luxury.","但是他从没有想过把钱花在自己身上，因为他很乐意像之前一直生活的那样继续生活下去，他真的不渴望追求更舒适更奢侈的生活。"
"At last he threw all the money into an old sack, which he pushed under his bead, and then, rolled in his ragged old blanket, he went off to sleep.","最后他把所有的钱扔进一个旧的麻布袋，把它推到床下。然后，裹上破烂不堪的旧毛毯，他起身去睡觉了。"
"Early next morning he staggered off with his sack of money to the shop of a jeweller, whom he knew in the town, and bargained with him for a beautiful little gold bracelet.","第二天初晨，他背着钱麻袋，步履蹒跚地走到一个他在镇上认识的珠宝商店里，一番讨价还价后，他买下了一个漂亮的小金手镯。"
"With this carefully wrapped up in his cotton waistband he went to the house of a rich friend, who was a travelling merchant, and used to wander about with his camels and merchandise through many countries.","他把它小心翼翼地包在他棉制的腰带里后，到了一个富有的朋友家里去。他是一个旅行商人，常常带着他的骆驼和货物漫游在许多国家之间。"
"Wali Dad was lucky enough to find him at home, so he sat down, and after a little talk he asked the merchant who was the most virtuous and beautiful lady he had ever met with.","瓦利·戴德足够幸运，他的朋友正好在家，因此他坐了下来。在一个简短的谈话之后，他问商人曾经遇见过的最贤惠、最漂亮的女人是谁。"
"The merchant replied that the princess of Khaistan was renowned everywhere as well for the beauty of her person as for the kindness and generosity of her disposition.","商人回复说，海斯坦的公主世人皆知，她不仅外表美丽，而且拥有心地善良、慷慨大方的品质。"
"‘Then,’ said Wali Dad, ‘next time you go that way, give her this little bracelet, with the respectful compliments of one who admires virtue far more than he desires wealth.’","“那么，”瓦利·戴德说，“下回你去那里，给她这个小手镯，向她致以我最崇高的敬意，我对她美德的赞赏远胜于对财富的渴望。”"
"With that he pulled the bracelet from his waistband, and handed it to his friend.","他边说边把手镯从腰带里拉出来，把它递给他的朋友。"
"The merchant was naturally much astonished, but said nothing, and made no objection to carrying out his friend’s plan.","当然，商人感到很吃惊，但没说什么，并没有反对去实行他朋友的计划。"
"Time passed by, and at length the merchant arrived in the course of his travels at the capital of Khaistan.","时光流逝，最终商人在他的旅途期间到达了海斯坦的首都。"
"As soon as he had opportunity he presented himself at the palace, and sent in the bracelet, neatly packed in a little perfumed box provided by himself, giving at the same time the message entrusted to him by Wali Dad.","他瞅准机会来到宫殿上，将手镯放在他另备的一个充满香气的小盒子里，并把手镯呈了上去，同时捎上瓦利·戴德委托的口信。"
"The princess could not think who could have bestowed this present on her, but she bade her servant to tell the merchant that if he would return, after he had finished his business in the city, she would give him her reply.","公主想不出是谁赠与了她这个礼物，但她吩咐她的仆人去告诉商人，在这个城市做完他的事后，如果他会回来，她就将给他答复。"
"In a few days, therefore, the merchant came back, and received from the princess a return present in the shape of a camel-load or rich silks, besides a present of money for himself.","因此，几天之后，商人回来了，除了给他自己的一些赏钱之外，还获得了公主回赠的一头骆驼才能装载的礼物和珍贵的丝绸。"
"With these he set out on his journey.","带着这些东西，他开始了自己的行程。"
"Some months later he got home again from his journeyings, and proceeded to take Wali Dad the princess’s present.","几个月后，他结束旅途，再次回到家乡，给瓦利·戴德送去了公主赠送的礼物。"
"Great was the perplexity of the good man to find a camel-load of silks tumbled at his door!","这个好人发现那些骆驼才能驮起的丝绸滚落在他的门口，困惑至极！"
"What was he to do with these costly things?","他用这些昂贵的东西做什么呢？"
"But, presently, after much thought, he begged the merchant to consider whether he did not know of some young prince to whom such treasures might be useful.","但是不久，经过认真思考，他请求商人想想看，他是否了解这些珍宝对某个年轻的王子来说有没有用。"
"‘Of course,’ cried the merchant, greatly amused; ‘from Delhi to Baghdad, and from Constantinople to Lucknow, I know them all; and there lives none worthier than the gallant and wealthy young prince of Nekabad.’","“当然有用啊，”商人感到非常好笑，大声喊道，“从德里到巴格达，从君士坦丁堡到勒克瑙，我都了解。那儿没有比尼科百德的年轻王子更英勇、更富有的杰出人物了。”"
"‘Very well, then, take the silks to him, with the blessing of an old man,’ said Wali Dad, much relieved to be rid of them.","“很好，那么，把这些丝绸给他，并带上一个老人的祝福。”瓦利·戴德说道，丢掉它们使他轻松多了。"
"So, the next time that the merchant journeyed that way he carried the silks with him, and in due course arrived at Nekabad, and sought an audience of the prince.","于是，下次商人像那样旅行时，随身携带着丝绸，并及时地到达了尼科百德，寻找到了王子的一名随从。"
"When he was shown into his presence he produced the beautiful gift of silks that Wali Dad had sent, and begged the young man to accept them as a humble tribute to his worth and greatness.","当他被领进他的大殿时，他献上了瓦利·戴德送来的那些漂亮的丝绸，请求年轻的王子收下它们，作为对显达尊贵、功绩显赫的王子的一点儿卑微的贡品。"
"The prince was much touched by the generosity of the giver, and ordered, as a return present, twelve of the finest breed of horses for which his country was famous to be delivered over to the merchant, to whom also, before he took his leave, he gave a munificent reward for his services.","王子对赠与者的慷慨行为非常感动，下令在以马而闻名的本国挑出十二匹品种最优良的马给商人作为回馈的礼物，在商人离开之前，王子看他不辞辛劳，还给了商人丰厚的赏钱。"
"As before, the merchant at last arrived at home; and next day, he set out for Wali Dad’s house with the twelve horses.","像以前一样，最后商人回到了家。第二天，他带着这十二匹马出发到瓦利·戴德的家里去。"
"When the old man saw them coming in the distance he said to himself: ‘Here’s luck! a troop of horses coming!","当老人在远处看到他们过来了，他自言自语说道：“好运来了！来了一群马儿！"
"They are sure to want quantities of grass, and I shall sell all I have without having to drag it to market.’","它们必定想要很多草，我应该卖掉所有的草，不能让市场断货。”"
" Thereupon he rushed off and cut grass as fast he could.","随即，他冲出门去，以他尽可能快的速度去割草。"
"When he got back, with as much grass as he could possibly carry, he was greatly discomfited to find that the horses were all for himself.","当他携带着尽可能多携带的草返回时，他发现这些马都是给他的，他感到很惶恐不安。"
"At first he could not think what to do with them, but, after a little, a brilliant idea struck him!","起初他不知道用它们做什么，但是，一会儿之后，一个绝妙的想法闪现出来。"
"He gave two to the merchant, and begged him to take the rest to the princess of Khaistan, who was clearly the fittest person to possess such beautiful animals.","他把两匹马给了商人，并请求他把余下的带给海斯坦的公主，显然公主是拥有这些漂亮动物的最合适人选。"
"The merchant departed, laughing.","商人笑着离开了。"
"But, true to his old friend’s request, he took the horses with him on his next journey, and eventually presented them safely to the princess.","但是，应允他老朋友的要求，他带着这些马又一次踏上了旅程，最终把它们安全地呈献给了公主。"
"This time the princess sent for the merchant, and questioned him about the giver.","这次公主派人请来商人，问他关于赠与者的情况。"
"Now, the merchant was usually a most honest man, but he did not quite like to describe Wali Dad in his true light as an old man whose income was five halfpence a day, and who had hardly clothes to cover him.","平常，商人是一个相当诚实的人，但是此时，他非常不愿意去描绘瓦利·戴德的真实情况：他是个老人，一天的收入是两个半便士，几乎衣不遮体。"
"So he told her that his friend had heard stories of her beauty and goodness, and had longed to lay the best he had at her feet.","所以，他告诉她，说是他的朋友听说了关于她的美丽和善良的故事，渴望把他拥有的最好的东西放置在她的脚下。"
"The princess then took her father into her confidence, and begged him to advise her what courtesy she might return to one who persisted in making her such presents.","然后，公主向她的父亲吐露了心中的秘密，乞求他给予她建议，到底要回赠一个坚持不懈赠与她如此丰厚礼物的人什么才是礼貌。"
"‘Well,’ said the king, ‘you cannot refuse them; so the best thing you can do is to send this unknown friend at once a present so magnificent that he is not likely to be able to send you anything better, and so will be ashamed to send anything at all!’","“好吧，”国王说，“你不能拒收它们。你能做的最妙的方法是马上给予这个陌生的朋友一个华丽的礼物，以至于他不可能再送你更好的东西了，所以他不管送你什么都会彻底地感到羞愧了！”"
" Then he ordered that, in place of each of the ten horses, two mules laden with silver should be returned by her.","于是他下令，她应该回赠能载满银币的两头骡子，来交换那十匹马中的两匹。"
"Thus, in a few hours, the merchant found himself in charge of a splendid caravan; and he had to hire a number of armed men to defend it on the road against the robbers, and he was glad indeed to find himself back again in Wali Dad’s hut.","由此，在几个小时之后，商人发现自己负责掌管着一支雄伟的商队。他不得不雇用一些武装人员在路上保护它以预防劫匪，他的确很高兴自己又返回到了瓦利·戴德的小屋。"
"‘Well, now,’ cried Wali Dad, as he viewed all the wealth laid at his door, ‘I can well repay that kind prince for his magnificent present of horses; but to be sure you have been put to great expenses!","“那好吧，现在，”当他看着所有的财富堆放在门口，瓦利·戴德喊道，“我会好好地报答把马作为丰厚礼物送给我的那位善良的王子。但是当然了，你也开销不少。"
"Still, if you will accept six mules and their loads, and will take the rest straight to Nekabad, I shall thank you heartily.’","尽管如此，如果你将接受六匹骡子和它们的负载物品，然后把剩余的物品直接带到尼科百德，我会衷心地感谢你。”"
"The merchant felt handsomely repaid for his trouble, and wondered greatly how the matter would turn out.","商人在很大程度上感到他又陷入了麻烦，他想知道这件事会发展成什么样子。"
"So he made no difficulty about it; and as soon as he could get things ready, he set out for Nekabad with this new and princely gift.","于是，他没有对此提出任何异议。他一准备好东西，就带着这份新而高贵的礼物，动身前往尼科百德。"
"This time the prince, too, was embarrassed, and questioned the merchant closely.","这次，王子也感到为难，就一个劲地询问商人。"
"The merchant felt that his credit was at stake, and whilst inwardly determining that he would not carry the joke any further, could not help describing Wali Dad in such glowing terms that the old man would never have known himself had he heard them.","商人感到他的信誉已岌岌可危，同时暗暗下定决心不再继续开这个玩笑了，他禁不住用那些热情洋溢之词来描绘瓦利·戴德，所以这个老人将不会知道别人口中的自己了。"
"The prince, like the king of Khaistan, determined that he would send in return a gift that would be truly royal, and which would perhaps prevent the unknown giver sending him anything more.","这位王子——像海斯坦的国王一样——决定将送出一份真正高贵的回馈礼物，这也许将会阻止那位陌生赠与者再送给他任何东西了。"
"So he made up a caravan on twenty splendid horses caparisoned in gold embroidered cloths, with fine morocco saddles and silver bridles and stirrups, also twenty camels of the best breed, which had the speed of race-horses, and could swing along at a trot all day without getting tired; and, lastly, twenty elephants, with magnificent silver howdahs and coverings of silk embroidered with pearls.","因此，他组建了一支大商队：二十匹的好马，它们用金色刺绣衣、摩洛哥皮革材质的马鞍和银色的缰绳以及马镫做装饰；二十头最好品种的骆驼，它们拥有着赛马的速度，能一整天小跑转向而不感到累；最后，还有二十头大象，大象身上放着华丽的银色象轿和铺着绣有珍珠的丝绸毯子。"
"To take care of these animals the merchant hired a little army of men; and the troop made a great show as they travelled along.","为了照顾好这些动物，商人雇用了一小队武装人员。当他们一路前行时，这队人马出尽了风头。"
"When Wali Dad from a distance saw the cloud of dust which the caravan made, and the glitter of its appointments, he said to himself: ‘By Allah! here’s a grand crowd coming!","当瓦利·戴德在不远处看到这支商队扬起的漫天尘埃和装饰设备的闪闪发光，他自言自语道：“真主阿拉，这儿来了一队盛大的人马啊！"
"Elephants, too!","还有大象！"
"Grass will be selling well to-day!’","今天草会卖得很好的！”"
" And with that he hurried off to the jungle and cut grass as fast as he could.","紧接着，他匆忙跑到丛林，以他尽可能快的速度去割草。"
"As soon as he got back he found the caravan had stopped at his door, and the merchant was waiting, a little anxiously, to tell him the news and to congratulate him upon his riches.","一回来，他就发现商队已经停在了他家门口，商人有点儿着急，正等着去告诉他这个消息，并祝贺他的万贯财富。"
"‘Riches!’ cried Wali Dad, ‘what has an old man like me with one foot in the grave to do with riches?","“财富！”瓦利·戴德嚷道，“像我这样行将就木的人要这些财富做什么呢？"
"That beautiful young princess, now!","现在，那位美丽的年轻公主，"
"She’d be the one to enjoy all these fine things!","她应该是享有这些美好东西的人！"
"Do you take for yourself two horses, two camels, and two elephants, with all their trappings, and present the rest to her.’","你自己拿走两匹马，两头骆驼和两头大象，还有所有的装饰物，剩下的赠送给她。”"
"The merchant at first objected to these remarks, and pointed out to Wali Dad that he was beginning to feel these embassies a little awkward.","起初，商人反对这些话，并向瓦利·戴德指出，他开始感到这些使命有点儿难处理了。"
"Of course he was himself richly repaid, so far as expenses went; but still he did not like going so often, and he was getting nervous.","当然，他自己得到了远远超过开销费用的丰厚的回报；然而他不想如此频繁地出行了，他开始紧张起来了。"
"At length, however he consented to go once more, but he promised himself never to embark on another such enterprise.","最后，尽管他同意再次出行，但是他向自己保证，再也不会做另一件像这样的事了。"
"So, after a few days’ rest, the caravan started off once more for Khaistan.","于是，在休息了几天后，大商队再次向海斯坦出发。"
"The moment the king of Khaistan saw the gorgeous train of men and beasts entering his palace courtyard, he was so amazed that he hurried down in person to inquire about it, and became dumb when he heard that these also were a present from the princely Wali Dad, and were for the princess, his daughter.","海斯坦的国王一看到这队壮观的人和牲畜进入了他的宫殿庭院，他惊讶万分，于是亲自跑下来去询问情况，当他听说这些也是来自高贵的瓦利·戴德送来的礼物，并是送给他女儿——公主的礼物时，他变得哑口无言了。"
"He went hastily off to her apartments, and said to her: ‘I tell you what it is, my dear, this man wants to marry you; that is the meaning of all these presents!","他急忙跑到她的闺房，对她说：“亲爱的，我来告诉你发生了什么，这个人想娶你，那就是所有这些礼物的用意！"
"There is nothing for it but that we go and pay him a visit in person.","我们去亲自拜访他，除此以外，别无他法。"
"He must be a man of immense wealth, and as he is so devoted to you, perhaps you might do worse than marry him!’","他一定是个集万千财富于一身的人，既然他如此中意于你，你最好还是嫁给他。”"
"The princess agreed with all that her father said, and orders were issued for vast numbers of elephants and camels, and gorgeous tents and flags, and litters for the ladies, and horses for the men, to be prepared without delay, as the king and princess were going to pay a visit to the great and munificent prince Wali Dad.","公主赞同他父亲所说的一切，因为国王和公主要拜访那位伟大而慷慨的王子——瓦利·戴德，于是他们下达命令，立即去准备许多大象、骆驼、华丽的帐篷和旗帜，还有女士们坐的轿子和男人们骑的马。"
"The merchant, the king declared, was to guide the party.","国王宣布，就由商人带领这队人马。"
"The feelings of the poor merchant in this sore dilemma can hardly be imagined.","这个可怜的商人处于进退两难的境地，这种痛楚几乎是不能想象的。"
"Willingly would he have run away; but he was treated with so much hospitality as Wali Dad’s representative, that he hardly got an instant’s real peace, and never any opportunity of slipping away.","他真想一跑了之，但是作为瓦利·戴德的代表，他被招待得如此周到，以至于他几乎得不到片刻的安宁，永远没有任何悄悄溜走的机会。"
"In fact, after a few days, despair possessed him to such a degree that he made up his mind that all that happened was fate, and that escape was impossible; but he hoped devoutly some turn of fortune would reveal to him a way out of the difficulties which he had, with the best intentions, drawn upon himself.","实际上，几天之后，他失望至极，以至于他觉得所有发生的一切都是命运，逃跑是不可能的。但是他衷心地希望某个命运的转变会指引一条让他脱离困境的路，并为自己构造出最好的计划蓝图。"
"On the seventh day they all started, amidst thunderous salutes from the ramparts of the city, and much dust, and cheering, and blaring of trumpets.","第七天，在来自城邦壁垒雷鸣般的致敬声中夹杂着尘土、欢呼声和号角声，他们出发了。"
"Day after day they moved on, and every day the poor merchant felt more ill and miserable.","日复一日，他们继续前进，这个可怜的商人每天都感到更不舒服、更痛苦。"
"He wondered what kind of death the king would invent for him, and went through almost as much torture, as he lay awake nearly the whole of every night thinking over the situation, as he would have suffered if the king’s executioners were already setting to work upon his neck.","他想知道国王会对他实行什么样的死刑，他会受尽足够的酷刑折磨，因为整个夜晚他睁着眼，躺在床上想象着这种情形，如果国王的刽子手已经准备去在他的脖子上动刀，他定会遭受痛苦。"
"At last they were only one day’s march from Wali Dad’s little mud home.","终于，他们离瓦利·戴德的土房子只有一天的行程了。"
"Here a great encampment was made, and the merchant was sent on to tell Wali Dad that the King and Princess of Khaistan had arrived and were seeking an interview.","他们在这里建了个大营地，商人被派遣去告诉瓦利·戴德，海斯坦的国王和公主已经来了，想和他见见。"
"When the merchant arrived he found the poor old man eating his evening meal of onions and dry bread, and when he told him of all that had happened he had not the heart to proceed to load him with the reproaches which rose to his tongue.","当商人到达时，他发现这个可怜的老人正在吃晚饭——洋葱和干面包，当他告诉他发生的一切时，他没有勇气继续对他说出已到嘴边的责备。"
"For Wali Dad was overwhelmed with grief and shame for himself, for his friend, and for the name and honour of the princess; and he wept and plucked at his beard, and groaned most piteously.","至于瓦利·戴德，他不知所措，他对自己、对他的朋友以及对公主的名义和尊严充满悲伤和羞愧。他哭了，拨弄着他的胡须，非常可怜地呻吟着。"
"With tears he begged the merchant to detain them for one day by any kind of excuse he could think of, and to come in the morning to discuss what they should do.","他哭着恳求商人用他能想到的任何借口去拖延他们一天，并让他早上过来商量他们应该怎么做。"
"As soon as the merchant was gone Wali Dad made up his mind that there was only one honourable way out of the shame and distress that he had created by his foolishness, and that was—to kill himself.","商人一离开，瓦利·戴德就决定要从他自己由于愚蠢而创造的羞愧和痛苦中摆脱出来，他只能想到一个体面的方法——自杀。"
"So, without stopping to ask any one’s advice, he went off in the middle of the night to a place where the river wound along at the base of steep rocky cliffs of great height, and determined to throw himself down and put an end to his life.","至此，他没有停下来去询问任何人的建议，就在半夜时离开了，到达了一个地方，那里河流环绕着很高而陡峭的岩石悬崖的底部，他决定去纵身一跃，结束自己的生命。"
"When he got to the place he drew back a few paces, took a little run, and at the very edge of that dreadful black gulf he stopped short!","当他到达那个地方时，他回退了几步，一阵小跑，在即将接近那可怕的黑色深渊的边缘时，他突然停了下来。"
"He COULD not do it!","他不能这样做！"
"From below, unseen in the blackness of the deep night shadows, the water roared and boiled round the jagged rocks—he could picture the place as he knew it, only ten times more pitiless and forbidding in the visionless darkness; the wind soughed through the gorge with fearsome sighs, and rustlings and whisperings, and the bushes and grasses that grew in the ledges of the cliffs seemed to him like living creatures that danced and beckoned, shadowy and indistinct.","从下面，在深夜一片漆黑的影子里什么也看不见，河水环绕着参差不齐的岩石咆哮翻滚着——他能描绘出这个他熟悉的地方，那里只有超过十倍的冷酷无情的、令人生畏的无尽的黑暗。风穿过峡谷，伴随着呼啸声、瑟瑟声和沙沙声飒飒作响。那些生长在悬崖边缘的灌木和杂草，在他看来像有生命的生物。"
"An owl laughed ‘Hoo! hoo!’ almost in his face, as he peered over the edge of the gulf, and the old man threw himself back in a perspiration of horror.","一只猫头鹰嘲笑他：“呼！呼！”当他望着深渊的边缘，老人向后退回去了，害怕得直冒冷汗。"
"He was afraid!","他害怕了！"
"He drew back shuddering, and covering his face in his hands he wept aloud.","他颤抖着，退了回去，把他的脸埋在他的双手里，大声地哭起来。"
"Presently he was aware of a gentle radiance that shed itself before him.","不久，他意识到一束柔光在他面前散布开来。"
"Surely morning was not already coming to hasten and reveal his disgrace!","当然，早晨还没有去为了加速暴露他的这份耻辱而提前来临。"
"He took his hands from before his face, and saw before him two lovely beings whom his instinct told him were not mortal, but were Peris from Paradise.","他把手从脸前拿开，看到他面前有两个可爱的人，他的直觉告诉他，他们不是凡人，而是从天堂来的精灵。"
"‘Why do you weep, old man?’ said one, in a voice as clear and musical as that of the bulbul.","“你为什么哭泣啊，老爷爷？”一个精灵用如同夜莺般清脆悦耳的声音说道。"
"‘I weep for shame,’ replied he.","“我由于羞愧而哭泣。”他回答。"
"‘What do you here?’ questioned the other.","“你在这做什么？”另一个精灵问。"
"‘I came here to die,’ said Wali Dad.","“我来这里寻死的。”瓦利·戴德说。"
"And as they questioned him, he confessed all his story.","当他们问他时，他袒露了他的整个故事。"
"Then the first stepped forward and laid a hand upon his shoulder, and Wali Dad began to feel that something strange—what, he did not know—was happening to him.","那时，第一个精灵向前迈了出来，把一只手放到了他的肩膀上，瓦利·戴德开始感到奇妙的事——什么，他不知道——正发生在他的身上。"
"His old cotton rags of clothes were changed to beautiful linen and embroidered cloth; on his hard, bare feet were warm, soft shoes, and on his head a great jewelled turban.","他的棉质破旧衣衫变成了漂亮的亚麻刺绣衣服；他粗糙、光秃的双脚上穿着一双温暖、柔软的鞋子；他的头上戴着一个漂亮的、镶有宝石的头巾。"
"Round his neck there lay a heavy golden chain, and the little old bent sickle, which he cut grass with, and which hung in his waistband, had turned into a gorgeous scimetar, whose ivory hilt gleamed in the pale light like snow in moonlight.","他的脖子挂着一条大的金链子，那个他用来割草的、挂在他腰带上的小而旧的镰刀已经变成了一个绚丽的钩镰，它的象牙材质的刀把在暗淡的灯光下微微闪烁，就像月光下的白雪。"
"As he stood wondering, like a man in a dream, the other peri waved her hand and bade him turn and see; and, lo! before him a noble gateway stood open.","正当他站着觉得惊奇，像个梦幻中的人时，另外一个精灵挥挥她的手，命令他转过身去看。天啊，看！在他前面一扇宏伟的大门敞开了。"
"And up an avenue of giant place trees the peris led him, dumb with amazement.","在一条有大树的街道上面，精灵们引领着他，他惊讶得哑口无言。"
"At the end of the avenue, on the very spot where his hut had stood, a gorgeous palace appeared, ablaze with myriads of lights.","在街道的尽头，就在他的小屋坐落的地方，一座金碧辉煌的宫殿出现了，闪耀着无数的灯光。"
"Its great porticoes and verandahs were occupied by hurrying servants, and guards paced to and fro and saluted him respectfully as he drew near, along mossy walks and through sweeping grassy lawns where fountains were playing and flowers scented the air.","宏伟的门廊和走廊被匆忙的仆人占据了，守卫们在来回走动，当他走近时，他们尊敬地向他行礼，沿着长满青苔的小路，通过被打扫干净的草坪，那里喷泉在喷射，空中散发着鲜花的香味。"
"Wali Dad stood stunned and helpless.","瓦利·戴德站在那里，目瞪口呆，无能为力。"
"‘Fear not,’ said one of the peris; ‘go to your house, and learn that God rewards the simple-hearted.’","“不要害怕，”一个精灵说，“走进你的房子，就会知道是上帝奖赏纯朴真诚的人的。”"
"With these words they both disappeared and left him.","说完这些话，两个精灵消失了，离开了他。"
"He walked on, thinking still that he must be dreaming.","他继续行走，一直在想，他一定是在做梦。"
"Very soon he retired to rest in a splendid room, far grander than anything he had ever dreamed of.","不久，他离开了，去一个豪华的房间休息，这比他曾经梦想过的任何房间要豪华得多。"
"When morning dawned he woke, and found that the palace, and himself, and his servants were all real, and that he was not dreaming after all!","当天破晓，他醒来时，他发现宫殿、他自己和他的仆人们都是真实的，他竟然不是在做梦！"
"If he was dumbfounded, the merchant, who was ushered into his presence soon after sunrise, was much more so.","如果他震惊得目瞪口呆，那个在日出后不久被招待出席的商人感到更加不可思议。"
"He told Wali Dad that he had not slept all night, and by the first streak of daylight had started to seek out his friend.","他告诉瓦利·戴德，他整夜没睡，天刚一亮，他就起床去找他的朋友了。"
"And what a search he had had!","他找到了什么啊！"
"A great stretch of wild jungle country had, in the night, been changed into parks and gardens; and if it had not been for some of Wali Dad’s new servants, who found him and brought him to the palace, he would have fled away under the impression that his trouble had sent him crazy, and that all he saw was only imagination.","在夜晚，一大片蔓延的野生丛林变成了公园和花园。如果不是一些瓦利·戴德的新仆人发现他，把他带到宫殿，他本该逃跑了，在他的印象中，他被烦恼逼得发疯了，他所看到的一切只是幻觉。"
"Then Wali Dad told the merchant all that had happened.","然后，瓦利·戴德告诉商人那些已经发生的一切。"
"By his advice he sent an invitation to the king and princess of Khaistan to come and be his guests, together with all their retinue and servants, down to the very humblest in the camp.","通过他的建议，他向海斯坦的国王和公主发出一份邀请，让他们来做他的客人，并连同所有他们的随从、仆人们以及露营中最卑微的人。"
"For three nights and days a great feast was held in honour of the royal guests.","为了对高贵的客人表示敬意，他举办了一个盛大的宴会，并持续了三天三夜。"
"Every evening the king and his nobles were served on golden plates and from golden cups; and the smaller people on silver plates and from silver cups; and each evening each guest was requested to keep the places and cups that they had used as a remembrance of the occasion.","每天晚上，国王和他的贵族们被招待使用金盘子和金杯子；身份低些的人使用银盘子和银杯子。每个晚上，每个客人被要求去把他们用过的盘子和杯子保留下来，作为这个场合使用的纪念品。"
"Never had anything so splendid been seen.","从没有人看过如此奢华的场面。"
"Besides the great dinners, there were sports and hunting, and dances, and amusements of all sorts.","除了盛大的晚宴之外，那里还有体育运动和打猎、舞蹈和各式各样的消遣活动。"
"On the fourth day the king of Khaistan took his host aside, and asked him whether it was true, as he had suspected, that he wished to marry his daughter.","第四天，海斯坦的国王把主人拉到一边，问他希望去娶他的女儿是否是真的，因为他很怀疑。"
"But Wali Dad, after thanking him very much for the compliment, said that he had never dreamed of so great an honour, and that he was far too old and ugly for so fair a lady; but he begged the king to stay with him until he could send for the Prince of Nekabad, who was a most excellent, brave, and honourable young man, and would surely be delighted to try to win the hand of the beautiful princess.","但是瓦利·戴德，在对其赞美之词表示衷心的感谢后说，他从来没有梦想过获得如此大的荣誉，对于如此美丽的一位小姐，他太老了、太丑了。然而，他乞求国王留在这，直到他派人去请尼科百德的王子，他是个最优秀、最勇敢和最值得尊敬的年轻人，他一定会很高兴地设法去赢得漂亮公主的芳心。"
"To this the king agreed, and Wali Dad sent the merchant to Nekabad, with a number of attendants, and with such handsome presents that the prince came at once, fell head over ears in love with the princess, and married her at Wali Dad’s palace amidst a fresh outburst of rejoicings.","对此，国王同意了，瓦利·戴德派商人去尼科百德，马上，王子来了，连同许多侍者和漂亮的礼物，他深深地爱上了公主，在纯真的欢欣庆祝声中，他在瓦利·戴德的宫殿里娶了公主。"
"And now the King of Khaistan and the Prince and Princess of Nekabad, each went back to their own country; and Wali Dad lived to a good old age, befriending all who were in trouble and preserving, in his prosperity, the simple-hearted and generous nature that he had when he was only Wali Dad Gunjay, the grass cutter.","现在，海斯坦的国王、尼科百德的王子和王妃，每个人返回到了他们自己的国家。瓦利·戴德活了很久，他帮助所有陷入困境的人，在他辉煌的一生中，他一直保留着当他只是瓦利·戴德·冈杰——割草人时所拥有的纯朴真诚和慷慨大方的本性。"
