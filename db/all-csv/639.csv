"红发俱乐部[^1]","The Red-Headed League"
"去年的一个秋日，我去探望我朋友歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生，发现他正在聚精会神地跟人聊天，对方是一个健硕异常、面色红润的老先生，头发如火焰一般鲜红耀眼。我为自己的冒昧打扰道了声歉，正打算就此离去，福尔摩斯却猛一把将我拽进房间，跟着就关上了门。","I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me."
"“你来得再巧不过了，亲爱的华生，”他恳切地说道。","“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he said cordially."
"“要我看，你现在有事情吧。”","“I was afraid that you were engaged.”"
"“我确实有事情，事情还非常多。”","“So I am. Very much so.”"
"“那我到隔壁去等你好了。”","“Then I can wait in the next room.”"
"“完全不用。威尔逊先生，您眼前的这位先生曾经跟我一起办过许多最为成功的案子，还给过我莫大的帮助，我完全肯定，在您的这件案子当中，他也能给我同样的帮助。”","“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”"
"身形健硕的老先生从椅子上抬起半个身子，略微表示了一下问候，还用肿泡泡的小眼睛飞快地扫了我一眼，眼神里带着疑问。","The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small, fat-encircled eyes."
"“你坐那把长椅吧，”福尔摩斯一边说，一边倒进自己的扶手椅，双手的手指拢在了一起。每当他进入慎思明辨的状态，总是会摆出这么一副架势。“我知道，亲爱的华生，你我都是同道中人，都喜欢那些离奇古怪、超越日常生活陈腔滥调的事物。你之好奇爱异，证据就是你身上的那股热情，正是那股热情驱使你从我本人的小小事迹当中搜罗了那么多东西，对它们进行记录，甚而至于，恕我直言，进行夸大和粉饰。”","“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.”"
"“我的确对你那些案子非常地感兴趣，”我说道。","“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I observed."
"“你应该还记得吧，就在咱们着手调查玛丽·萨瑟兰小姐[^2]委托的那件极其简单的案子之前，我曾经对你说过，要想寻找离奇的现象和非凡的因果，咱们只能投入生活本身，原因在于，生活比人们的任何想象都要惊人得多。”","“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”"
"“你这个看法，当时我还不揣冒昧地提出了质疑呢。”","“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”"
"“当时的情形的确如此，医生，不过，现在你一定得转变立场，要不然，我就会把一堆又一堆的事实压到你的身上，直到压垮你的那些逻辑、迫使你承认我说得对为止。好了，今天早上，这位杰贝兹·威尔逊先生赏脸光临，开始给我讲一个故事，我敢肯定，他接下来的叙述将会成为我好些日子以来听到的最奇特的事情。我跟你说过，最离奇、最独特的那些东西通常与大案无关，往往都会在那些比较小的罪案当中出现，偶尔呢，说实在话，还会出现在一些连有没有罪案都成问题的场合。听到现在，我仍然无从判断，眼前的这件事情是不是一宗罪案，不过，事情的经过无疑是我这辈子最奇特的见闻之一。威尔逊先生，能不能麻烦您多多费心，把您的故事从头到尾再讲一遍。我这个不情之请，并不只是因为我朋友华生医生没有赶上故事的开头部分，也因为您的故事实在是非比寻常，以致我非常想从您嘴里听到尽可能多的细节。一般来说，如果能从事情的经过当中听出一丁点儿小小的提示，我就可以回想起成千上万的类似案例，由此找到方向。可是，就目前这个案子而言，我不得不承认，所有的事实，在我所知道的的范围之内，都称得上独一无二。”","“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever l istened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.” "
"听了他的话，身形肥硕的主顾挺起胸膛，神态之中带上了一点儿小小的自豪，接着就从大衣内兜里掏出了一张又脏又皱的报纸。他把报纸摊在自己的膝盖上，脑袋前倾，眼睛在报纸的启事栏里搜寻。趁着这段工夫，我把他好好地打量了一番，努力地模仿我朋友的方法，想要从他的衣装或者长相当中看出一些名堂来。","The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance."
"不过，我这番观察并没有带来多少收获。我们这位客人从头到脚都是个普普通通的英国商贩，肥胖、虚荣、反应迟钝。他穿着一条鼓鼓囊囊的棋盘格灰色长裤，以及一件算不上十分干净的黑色长礼服，礼服的前襟敞着，露出一件土黄色的马甲，马甲上吊着一根沉甸甸的阿尔伯特黄铜表链[^3]，链子上有一块穿了方孔的金属饰品，正在那里甩来甩去。他身边的椅子上放着一顶磨秃了的高顶礼帽，还有一件褪了色的棕褐大衣，大衣的丝绒领子已经起了皱。总体说来，不管我怎么看，除了火红的头发和极度懊丧不满的表情之外，眼前的这个人再没有什么能让人多看一眼的地方了。","I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features."
"我的举动没有逃过歇洛克·福尔摩斯那双锐利的眼睛，看到我询问的眼神，他微笑着摇了摇头。“他以前干过一段时间体力活，有吸鼻烟的习惯，是共济会的会员，曾经去过中国，近来还做过不少写字的工作，除了这些显而易见的事实之外，我也看不出什么别的了。”","Sherlock Holmes’s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”"
"杰贝兹·威尔逊先生在自己的椅子上打了个激灵，食指依然点着报纸，目光却落在了我同伴的身上。","Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion."
"“老天在上，这些事情您都是怎么知道的，福尔摩斯先生？”他问道。“比方说，您怎么知道我以前干过体力活儿呢？这件事情跟上帝的福音一样真实，因为我的第一份工作就是船上的木匠。”","“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour? It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”"
"“您的手告诉我的，亲爱的先生。您的右手比左手大得多，因为您老是用右手干活，右手的肌肉就比左手发达一些。”","“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”"
"“好吧，那么，鼻烟和共济会又是怎么回事呢？”","“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”"
"“我不想告诉您我是怎么看出来的，那样等于是侮辱您的智力，更何况，您还不顾您那个组织的严格规章，把一枚圆规加量角器图案的胸针别在了身上[^4]。”","“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.”"
"“噢，当然，我倒把这东西给忘了。可是，写字的工作又是怎么回事呢？”","“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”"
"“您右边的袖口有一截已经磨得油光锃亮，宽度足足有五英寸，左边袖子的胳膊肘附近也有一块磨秃了的地方，说明您经常把左胳膊肘架在书桌上，您说说，这些迹象还能代表别的什么事情吗？”","“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?”"
"“好吧，中国的事情呢？”","“Well, but China?”"
"“您右边手腕往上一点儿的地方刺着一条鱼，那样的刺青只可能来自中国。我对刺青图案作过一点儿小小的研究，甚至还为这个主题的相关文献增添了一点儿内容。您手腕上那种用轻柔粉色晕染鱼鳞的技艺基本上是中国的专利。再者说，既然您的表链上还吊着一枚中国的铜钱，事情就更加一目了然了。”","“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”"
"杰贝兹·威尔逊先生大声地笑了起来。“噢，真没想到！”他说道。“我一开始还觉得您神机妙算，眼下我才知道，说到底，这里面也没有什么了不起的东西。”","Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all.”"
"“我禁不住觉得，华生，”福尔摩斯说道，“我这番解释完全是个错误。‘莫测才是高深[^5]’，你明白吧，我这点儿名声本来就微不足道，再这样什么都不藏着的话，那就该什么也不剩了。您究竟能不能找到那则启事啊，威尔逊先生？”","“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in explaining. ‘*Omne ignotum pro magnifico*,’ you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”"
"“找到了，现在已经找到了，”他回答道，又粗又红的手指停在了启事栏的中央。“就在这儿。所有事情都是从这儿开始的。您自个儿看吧，先生。”","“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.”"
"我从他手里接过了报纸，启事内容如下：","I took the paper from him and read as follows:"
"> 致红发俱乐部全体会员：","> TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE:"
"> 谨奉美国宾夕法尼亚州黎巴嫩城埃兹基亚·霍普金斯遗赠，现有一新增职位空缺供俱乐部会员应选，周薪四镑，无需工作，挂名即可。年满二十一周岁、身体健康、心智健全之红发男性皆具应选资格。如欲应选，请于周一上午十一点亲身前往舰队街教皇巷[^6]7号红发俱乐部办公室，联系人：邓肯·罗斯。","> On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street."
"“这到底是什么意思？”我把这则非同一般的启事读了两遍，不由得脱口问了出来。","“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement."
"福尔摩斯吃吃地笑了起来，身子在椅子上扭来扭去。兴致高昂的时候，他总是这副样子。“这跟那些老一套的玩意儿有点儿不同，对吧？”他说道，“好了，威尔逊先生，您可以从头开始讲了，给我们讲讲您自个儿、您屋里的人，还有这则启事对您的生活造成的影响。医生，你先把报纸的名称和日期记下来吧。”","Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.”"
"“是一八九〇年四月二十七日的《纪事晨报》，离现在刚好两个月。”","“It is *The Morning Chronicle*of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”"
"“很好。可以开始了吗，威尔逊先生？”","“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”"
"“呃，就像我刚才跟您说的那样，歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生，”杰贝兹 ·威尔逊一边说，一边擦拭自己的额头，“我在故城[^7]附近的萨克斯-科伯格广场开了间小当铺，生意不大，近年来无非是勉强糊口而已。以前我还请得起两个伙计，现在却只有一个了。就这一个伙计我本来也是请不起的，还好他甘愿只领一半的工钱，说是为了跟我学做生意。”","“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.”"
"“这个好心肠的小伙子叫什么名字呢？”歇洛克·福尔摩斯问道。","“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes."
"“他的名字叫文森特·斯波尔丁，不过，他也算不上什么小伙子了。看不出他到底多大年纪。比他还要能干的伙计可不好找，福尔摩斯先生。我心里清楚得很，他完全可以另攀高枝，挣到比我这里高一倍的工钱。可是，不管怎么样，既然他自个儿都没什么意见，我又干吗要跟他提这个醒呢？”","“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?”"
"“是啊，干吗呢？能够按照低于行情的价钱请到伙计，真算是您的运气啊。这年月，能有您这种经历的东家可不常见。要我说，您这个伙计也不一般，就跟您看到的这则启事一样。”","“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.”"
"“哦，他也有他的毛病，”威尔逊先生说道，“从来都没有谁像他那么爱照相。该学东西的时候，他却拿着相机东拍西拍，然后就一头扎到地下室里去洗相片，就跟兔子进了洞似的。他最大的毛病就是这个，话又说回来，他总体上还算是个好伙计，没有什么坏心眼儿。”","“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”"
"“依我看，他现在还跟您住在一起吧？”","“He is still with you, I presume?”"
"“是的，先生。他，还有一个十四岁的小姑娘，小姑娘负责做点儿简单的伙食，另外还得打扫房间。我屋里就这么些人，因为我是个老光棍儿，从来都没有成过家。我们的生活很平静，先生，我们三个人。别的虽然干不了，我们总还有个安身的地方，该还的债也能还得上。","“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more."
"“给我们添乱的第一件事情就是这则启事。八个星期之前，就是报纸上写的这一天，斯波尔丁跑到办公室来找我，手里拿的就是这张报纸。当时他跟我说：","“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks ago, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:"
"“‘我真想祈求上帝，威尔逊先生，让他把我变成一个红头发的人。’","“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’"
"“‘为什么呢？’我问他。","“‘Why that?’ I asks."
"“‘是这样，’他说，‘红发俱乐部又有了一个空缺，只要能得到那个空缺，你就能小小地发一笔财。我听说，那儿的空缺很多，人却不够，所以啊，那些掌管基金的理事已经没了主意，不知道该拿手里的钱怎么办了。我的头发要能变变颜色该多好啊，那份儿小小的白食就在那儿摆着，只等着我去吃哩。’","“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-Headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’"
"“‘是吗，那么，到底是什么样的白食呢？’我问他。您瞧，福尔摩斯先生，我这个人特别喜欢待在家里，我的生意也是等人上门，用不着我去跑，所以呢，我经常连着几个星期都不跨出门槛一步。这样一来，我就不怎么了解外面的事情，每次听到点儿什么新闻，我心里也总是挺高兴的。","“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news."
"“‘难道说，您从来都没听说过红发俱乐部吗？’他瞪大了眼睛问我。 ","“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-Headed Men?’ he asked with his eyes open."
"“‘从来没听过。’","“‘Never.’"
"“‘是吗，那可真是怪了，您自个儿就有资格去申请他们的空缺啊。’ ","“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’"
"“‘他们的空缺值多少钱呢？’我问他。","“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked."
"“‘哦，一年两百镑而已，好就好在工作非常轻松，即便你还有其他的工作要干，也不会受到多大的影响。’","“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’"
"“呃，你们一想就知道，听了他的话，我耳朵都支了起来。这些年以来，铺子的生意一直不怎么好，要是能挣上两百镑的外快，倒真是一场及时雨呢。","“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy."
"“‘你从头到尾给我讲讲吧，’我这么说。","“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I."
"“‘喏，’他一边说，一边把启事拿给我看，‘您自个儿看看吧，俱乐部眼下就有一个空缺，启事里有他们的地址，具体的事情您应该上那儿去了解。我只知道，这个俱乐部的创始人是美国的一个百万富翁，名叫埃兹基亚·霍普金斯，行事非常古怪。他自己就长着一头红发，而且对其他的红发男人很有感情。他死了以后，大家发现他把偌大的家产托付给了一些理事，并且指示他们，要用这笔钱的收益来为红头发的男人安排一点儿轻松的差使。照我听说的情况来看，他们给的差使钱很多，要干的事情却很少。’","“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’"
"“‘可是，’我说，‘跑去申请的红头发男人可能得有几百万呢。’","“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.’"
"“‘没您想的那么多，’他这么回答。‘您瞧，这个差使实际上是只给伦敦人的，而且得是成年的男人。那个美国人年青的时候是在伦敦起的家，所以就想给这座老城办点儿好事儿。还有啊，我听说，要想去申请的话，头发的红颜色浅了不行，深了也不行，只有那种地地道道、鲜明耀眼的火红色才行。您瞧，如果您想去申请的话，威尔逊先生，直接去就行了。当然喽，就为了这么区区几百镑，兴许也不值得您去跑一趟。’","“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’"
"“好了，先生们，你们自个儿也看见了，我的头发确实是红得饱满、红得鲜艳，所以我就想，如果需要跟别人竞争的话，我中选的机会也不比我所见过的任何人差。文森特·斯波尔丁似乎对这件事情特别了解，我觉得他没准儿能帮上忙，于是就直接命令他上好窗板，停业一天，马上跟我一起出发。他倒是巴不得能有一天的假期，这么着，我俩就关上店门，往启事上登的那个地址去了。","“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement."
"“要我说，福尔摩斯先生，那样的景象我这辈子是再也见不到啦。四面八方的男的，但凡头发上有那么一丁点儿红色，全都噼里啪啦跑到城里应征来了。整条舰队街都让红头发的伙计堵得水泄不通，教皇巷看着就像一辆卖橘子的手推车。一条启事竟然从全国招来这么多红头发，我可真没想到。麦秸色、柠檬色、橙色、砖红色、爱尔兰红毛猎狗色、肝红色、黏土色，什么颜色的头发都有，不过，就像斯波尔丁说的那样，地道鲜明的火红色确实不多。看到有那么多的人在等着，我一下子泄了气，准备打道回府，斯波尔丁却死活不肯答应。他是怎么办到的我不知道，反正他生拉活拽，还拿脑袋当撞槌使，硬是拖着我挤过人群，走到了办公室门口的台阶上。办公室的楼梯上有两股人潮，一股满怀希望地往上涌，另一股垂头丧气地往下淌。我俩竭尽全力楔到人潮里面，不一会儿就走进了办公室。”","“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”"
"“您的经历真是太有趣了，”福尔摩斯插了一句，因为他的主顾暂时停止了讲述，挖了一大撮鼻烟来唤醒往日的回忆。“您这个故事真有意思，麻烦您接着讲吧。”","“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. “Pray continue your very interesting statement.”"
"“办公室里啥也没有，只有两把木头椅子和一张简陋的松木桌子，桌子后面坐着一个小个子男人，头发的颜色比我的还要红。他跟每一个走到近前的应征者都简单地交谈了几句，总是能从他们身上找出一点儿不合格的地方。说到底，想弄到人家提供的空缺，毕竟不是什么轻松便宜的事情。不过，轮到我俩上去的时候，小个子男人的确对我格外高看，待我的态度比待其他人都要好。我俩进去之后，他立刻关上了房门，为的是跟我俩私下聊聊。","“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us."
"“‘这位是杰贝兹·威尔逊先生，’我的伙计说，‘他打算应征俱乐部的空缺。’","“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’"
"“‘而他也特别适合填补这个空缺，’对方这么回答。‘所有条件他都具备。按我的记忆，这么漂亮的红头发，以前我还真没见过呢。’他往后退了一步，歪着脑袋盯住我的头发看了半天，看得我都不好意思了。这之后，他突然冲了过来，紧紧地握住我的手，热情地表示祝贺，祝贺我申请成功。","“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success."
"“‘我要是再犹豫不决的话，那就是对你不公道了，’他说，‘不过，照我看，你肯定能够理解，我必须采取一个最最基本的预防措施。’说完之后，他就用双手抓住我的头发，使劲儿地扯了起来，一直扯到我疼得大喊大叫为止。‘你眼泪都流出来了，’他放开了我，这么说了一句。‘我看得出你的头发没什么蹊跷，可我们没法不多加小心，因为我们已经被假发骗了两回，还上过一回颜料的当。我可以跟你讲一些用鞋蜡作假的故事，一准儿能让你觉得人性非常丑陋。’接下来，他走到窗子跟前，铆足了劲儿冲外面喊，说空缺已经有人填上了。下面传来了一阵失望的抱怨，人群轰然四散，到最后，除了我和那个管事的脑袋之外，所有的红脑袋都不见了。","“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager."
"“‘我名叫邓肯·罗斯，’他说，‘本身也是多亏了我们那位高贵的恩主，靠他那笔基金的收益过活。你结婚了吗，威尔逊先生？你有家庭吗？’","“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’"
"“我回答说我没有。","“I answered that I had not."
"“他的脸一下子沉了下来。","“His face fell immediately."
"“‘天哪！’他语气沉重地说，‘这事情可真是太严重了！听你这么说，我真是替你遗憾。天经地义，基金的宗旨不光是帮助红头发的人维持生计，还要帮助他们繁衍兴旺、开枝散叶。可你居然是个单身汉，这实在是太不走运了。’","“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’"
"“听了他的话，我的脸一下子拉得老长，福尔摩斯先生，因为我意识到，自己终归还是得不到那个空缺。不过，想了几分钟之后，他又改口跟我说，这事情没有什么问题。","“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right."
"“‘换作是别人的话，’他说，‘这样的缺陷可以说是无法容忍，不过，你的头发长得这么好，我们多少得给你通融一下。你什么时候能走上新的岗位呢？’","“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’"
"“‘呃，说起来有点儿不好意思，可我自己已经有了一桩买卖，’我说。","“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I."
"“‘噢，这个您用不着担心，威尔逊先生！’文森特·斯波尔丁说。‘我会替您把买卖看好的。’","“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that for you.’"
"“‘上班时间是怎么安排的呢？’我问。","“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked."
"“‘上午十点到下午两点。’","“‘Ten to two.’"
"“是这样，福尔摩斯先生，当铺的生意大多数都集中在晚上，尤其是周六发薪水之前，周四和周五的晚上。所以呢，上午去挣点儿外快，对我来说非常合适。除此之外，我知道我这个伙计非常能干，就算有什么事情，他也可以替我应付。","“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up."
"“‘这对我来说非常合适，’我说，‘薪水呢？’","“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’"
"“‘一周四镑。’ ","“‘Is four pounds a week.’"
"“‘工作是什么呢？’ ","“‘And the work?’"
"“‘挂名而已。’","“‘Is purely nominal.’"
"“‘您说的‘挂名而已’是什么意思？’","“‘What do you call purely nominal?’"
"“‘是这样，上班期间，你必须得一直待在办公室里，至少也得待在这座楼里。走开的话，你就会永远地失去这个职位。霍普金斯先生在遗嘱里把这一点说得特别清楚。如果你上班时间偷偷溜号的话，那就是违反了遗嘱里的要求。’","“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’"
"“‘一天不过四个小时，我不会想要溜号的，’我说。","“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I."
"“‘什么事情都不能成为借口，’邓肯·罗斯先生说，‘不管你是生了病，是生意忙，还是有什么别的理由。你必须在办公室里待着，否则就会丢掉这个工作。’","“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.’"
"“‘具体是干什么呢？’","“‘And the work?’"
"“‘抄写《大英百科全书》。书的第一卷就在那个立柜里，墨水、羽毛笔和吸墨纸你得自己带，不过我们会把这张桌子和这把椅子留给你。你明天就能来吗？’","“‘Is to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?’"
"“‘没问题，’我一口答应。","“‘Certainly,’ I answered."
"“‘很好，再见，杰贝兹 ·威尔逊先生，我要再一次表示祝贺，祝贺你幸运地获得了这么个重要职位。’说完之后，他点头示意我离开房间。这么着，我和伙计一起回了家，心里觉得无比庆幸，都不知道该说什么该做什么才好了。","“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.’ He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune."
"“这之后，我翻来覆去地想了一整天，到晚上就开始沮丧起来，因为我几乎已经断定，整件事情一定是一个巨大的骗局或者圈套，只不过我琢磨不透，他们究竟想骗什么。按我看，根本就不可能会有人留下这样的遗嘱，也不可能会有人为抄写《大英百科全书》这样的简单工作付这么高的薪水，这样的事情叫人完全无法相信。文森特·斯波尔丁竭力劝我往好处想，不过，临到上床睡觉的时候，我已经说服了自己，不要再跟这件事情搅在一起。可是，到了第二天早上，我还是决定，好歹也去那里看一看。于是我花一个便士买了瓶墨水，再带上一支羽毛笔和七张大页书写纸[^8]，就这么上教皇巷去了。","“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope’s Court."
"“到了之后，我又惊又喜地发现，一切情形都很正常。桌子已经替我预备好了，邓肯 ·罗斯先生也等在了那里，为的是确保我顺利地投入工作。他吩咐我从A字头开始抄，然后就走开了。不过，他时不时都会进来看一看，以便确定我还在正常工作。下午两点的时候，他跟我道了日安，还夸奖了一番我抄写的数量。我走出办公室之后，他就把门给锁上了。","“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me."
"“日子就这么一天一天地过，福尔摩斯先生，到了周六，罗斯先生走进办公室，往桌子上扔了四个金镑，作为我一周的薪水。第二个星期也是这样，第三个星期还是这样。每天我都是上午十点去，下午两点走。渐渐地，邓肯 ·罗斯先生来得越来越少，后来就变成每天上午只来一次，又过了一段时间，他压根儿就不来了。当然喽，我仍然不敢离开办公室一步，因为我不知道他什么时候又会来。这份工作这么好，又这么适合我的情况，我可不想把它丢掉。","“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it."
"“就这样过了八个星期，我已经抄完了‘方丈’、‘箭术’、‘盔甲’、‘建筑学’和‘阿提卡’等等词条[^9]，并且暗自期望，如果我加倍努力的话，兴许用不了多久就可以向B字头进军。我为大页书写纸花了不少的钱，我抄写的东西也几乎堆满了整整一个架子。可是，突然之间，整件事情就结束了。”","“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”"
"“结束了？”","“To an end?”"
"“结束了，先生。不在别的什么时候，恰恰就在今天早上。今天我跟平常一样，早上十点去上班，结果却发现办公室的门关着，而且上了锁，门板中央用大头钉钉着一块小小的方形卡片。卡片就在这儿，你们可以自个儿瞧瞧。”","“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.”"
"他举起了一张白色的卡片，卡片跟一张信纸差不多大，上面写的是：","He held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:"
"> 红发俱乐部","> THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE "
"> 业已","> Is "
"> 宣告解散","> DISSOLVED. "
"> 一八九〇年十月九日","> OCTOBER 9, 1890."
"歇洛克·福尔摩斯和我一会儿瞧瞧这则言简意赅的声明，一会儿又瞧瞧声明背后那张写满懊恼的面孔，到最后，整件事情当中的喜剧色彩终于彻底压过了其他的一切考虑，让我俩纵声狂笑起来。","Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter."
"“我看不出这里面有什么特别好笑的地方，”我们的主顾忿然叫道，一张脸红到了脖子根儿上。“你们俩要是光知道取笑我的话，我还是上别处去好了。”","“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”"
"“别，别走，”福尔摩斯一边大叫，一边把身子起了一半的主顾摁回了椅子上。“我说什么也不能错过您这件案子，因为它真是非同凡响，简直让人耳目一新。不过，您别介意我这么说，这事情的确有那么一点点好笑。麻烦您接着讲，发现门上的卡片之后，您是怎么做的呢？”","“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?”"
"“我惊得打了个趔趄，先生，不知道该怎么办才好。接下来，我去找了在周围上班的一些职员，可他们好像都对这事情一无所知。到最后，我跑到了房东那里，房东是个会计，就住在同一座楼的底层。我问他知不知道红发俱乐部出了什么事情，他说他从来没听说过这么个组织。然后我又问他，邓肯·罗斯先生到底是干什么的，他的回答是，这名字他还是头一次听说。","“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-Headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him."
"“‘那么，’我说，‘你总认识4号房的那位先生吧。’","“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’"
"“‘什么，你是说那个红头发的人吗？’ ","“‘What, the red-headed man?’"
"“‘没错。’ ","“‘Yes.’"
"“‘噢，’他说，‘他名叫威廉·莫里斯，是个法律顾问。他只是暂时租用我的房间，因为他的新办公室还没弄好。他昨天搬走的。’ ","“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’"
"“‘我该上哪儿去找他呢？’","“‘Where could I find him?’"
"“‘还能是哪儿，去他的新办公室呗。他倒是跟我说过他的新地址，没错，新地址是爱德华王大街 17号，就在圣保罗大教堂附近。’","“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’"
"“我马上就往那里赶，福尔摩斯先生，可是，找到那个地址之后，我发现那是家生产人工膝关节的工厂，厂里没人听说过威廉·莫里斯先生，也没人听说过邓肯·罗斯先生。”","“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”"
"“接下来您又是怎么做的呢？”福尔摩斯问道。","“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes."
"“我回到了萨克斯-科伯格广场的家里，想听听我那个伙计的意见。可是，他一点儿也帮不上我的忙，就知道劝我等一等，说他们应该会写信来。干等着可算不上什么特别好的法子，福尔摩斯先生。这么好的一个职位，我怎么也得挣扎挣扎才能放弃，所以呢，听说您心肠好，愿意给需要帮助的可怜人出主意，我就直接上您这儿来了。”","“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”"
"“您这么做非常明智，”福尔摩斯说道，“您这件案子极其特别，我十分乐意展开调查。根据您刚才说的情况，我估计，这里面多半有更加严重的内情，并不像乍一看那么简单。”","“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.”"
"“已经是够严重的了！”杰贝兹·威尔逊先生说道，“不是吗，我每周都少了四镑的收入啊。”","“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pounds a week.”"
"“从您个人的角度来看，”福尔摩斯说道，“我觉得您没有理由抱怨这家非同一般的俱乐部。恰恰相反，如果我没理解错的话，您挣到了大概三十镑，更别说还掌握了A字头所有词条所包含的详尽知识。他们可没给您什么亏吃啊。”","“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some thirty pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”"
"“确实没有，先生。可我还是想找到他们，想知道他们究竟是干什么的，同时也想问问他们，干吗要跟我开这么个玩笑，我的意思是，如果他们确实是在开玩笑的话。对他们来说，这个玩笑可开得有点儿贵啊，花了整整三十二镑呢。”","“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.”"
"“我们会努力帮您解答这些疑问的。这样吧，我首先要问您一两个问题，威尔逊先生。刚开始的时候，是您那个伙计让您注意到了报上的启事——那个时候，他在您那里干了多久了呢？”","“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”"
"“一个月左右。” ","“About a month then.”"
"“怎么开始的呢？” ","“How did he come?”"
"“他来应征我登的启事。”","“In answer to an advertisement.”"
"“只有他一个人来应征吗？” ","“Was he the only applicant?”"
"“不是，一共有十几个。” ","“No, I had a dozen.”"
"“您为什么选他呢？”","“Why did you pick him?”"
"“因为他手脚麻利，要价也便宜。” ","“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”"
"“只要一半的工钱，准确说的话。” ","“At half-wages, in fact.”"
"“没错。”","“Yes.”"
"“这个文森特·斯波尔丁长什么样呢？”","“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”"
"“小个子，体格健壮，手脚非常利索，脸蛋光光的，年纪却肯定在三十开外。额头上有一块酸液溅出的白斑。”","“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.”"
"听到这里，福尔摩斯非常兴奋地坐直了身子。“果然不出我的意料，”他说道，“他两只耳朵都穿了戴耳环的耳洞，您注意到了吗？”","Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?”"
"“是的，先生。他跟我说，那是他少年时候一个吉卜赛人帮他穿的。”","“Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a lad.”"
"“嗯！”福尔摩斯靠回椅子背上，沉思了一会儿。“眼下他还在您那里吗？”","“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with you?”"
"“哦，是的，先生。我来的时候他还在呢。”","“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”"
"“您不在的时候，他把您的生意照看得好吗？”","“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”"
"“没什么可挑剔的，先生。上午本来也没多少生意。”","“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a morning.”"
"“我问完了，威尔逊先生。关于这件事情，我非常乐意在一两天之内向您提供一点儿意见。今天是周六，据我看，我们应该能在周一之前拿出一个结论。”","“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. Today is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”"
"“好了，华生，”客人走了之后，福尔摩斯说道，“这些事情你怎么看呢？”","“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you make of it all?”"
"“我什么看法都没有，”我坦白招认。“这案子实在是太神秘了。”","“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious business.”"
"“一般说来，”福尔摩斯说道，“一件事情越是古怪，到头来就越不神秘。真正让人摸不着头脑的恰恰是那些普普通通、毫无特征的罪案，道理就跟普普通通的面孔最不好认一样。话说回来，这件事情刻不容缓，我必须立刻采取行动。”","“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your common-place, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”"
"“那么，你打算采取什么行动呢？”我问道。","“What are you going to do, then?” I asked."
"“抽点儿烟，”他回答道，“像这样的问题，怎么也得抽上三斗烟才行，还有啊，我得跟你告个假，五十分钟之内，你不要和我说话。”紧接着，他在椅子上蜷了起来，瘦骨伶仃的膝盖几乎顶到了他那个鹰钩鼻子。他就这么坐在那里，闭着眼睛，黑陶烟斗支棱在嘴巴外面，活像是某种异鸟的长喙。到后来，我断定他已经睡着了，自己也开始打起盹儿来，可他突然从椅子上蹦了起来，摆出一副斩钉截铁的架势，跟着就把烟斗搁到了壁炉台上。","“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece."
"“今天下午，圣詹姆斯音乐厅有萨拉萨蒂[^11]的演奏会，”他说道，“你觉得怎么样，华生？你那些病人能准你几个小时假吗？”","“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”"
"“今天我没什么事儿。我的日程一向都不算太满。”","“I have nothing to do today. My practice is never very absorbing.”"
"“那你就戴上帽子，跟我一块儿去吧。我打算先在故城里转一圈儿，路上还可以顺便吃个午饭。我发现，演奏会的节目单上有许多德国音乐，德国音乐可远比意大利或是法国音乐更对我的胃口。德国音乐有一种内省的特质，而我正需要好好地内省一下。走吧！”","“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”"
"我俩上了地铁[^12]，一直坐到阿尔德斯大门站，跟着就步行一小段，走到了萨克斯-科伯格广场，也就是我俩早上听说的那个离奇故事的发生地点。这是个狭窄拥挤、假充上流的小地方，四排烟熏火染的两层砖房俯瞰着一小块围了栏杆的空地，空地里是一片乱草横生的草坪和几丛凋萎的月桂，正在与烟雾腾腾、不甚可心的周遭环境进行殊死的搏斗。街角的一座房子上悬着三个镀金的圆球[^13]，还有一块写着“杰贝兹·威尔逊”几个白字的褐色招牌，标明了我们那位红头发主顾开展业务的处所。歇洛克·福尔摩斯在房门前停了下来，侧着脑袋把房子仔仔细细地打量了一遍，眯缝的眼睛里闪着明亮的光芒。接下来，他慢慢地顺着街道往上走，然后又倒回原来的街角，眼睛仍然死死地盯着街上的那些房子。到最后，他走回当铺跟前，用自己的手杖在人行道上使劲儿地敲打了两三次，这才走上前去敲了敲门。房门应声开启，一个长相伶俐、脸刮得干干净净的年轻人出现在了门口，还把他往屋里让。","We travelled by the underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JAbez WIlson” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in."
"“谢谢，”福尔摩斯说道，“我只是想问一问，从这儿到斯特兰街该怎么走。”","“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.”"
"“第三个路口右转，之后第四个路口左转，”伙计应答如响，跟着就关上了房门。","“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door."
"“精明哪，这个家伙，”我俩举步离去的时候，福尔摩斯赞叹了一声。“按我的评判，他是全伦敦第四精明的人，要说胆大嘛，我觉得他应该有资格排到第三。我以前就领教过他的厉害。”","“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”"
"“很显然，”我说道，“威尔逊先生的伙计在这件红发俱乐部谜案当中起了很大的作用。我敢打包票，你刚才问路只是为了看他一眼。”","“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-Headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”"
"“不是为了看他。”","“Not him.”"
"“那又是为了看什么？”","“What then?”"
"“为了看他裤子的膝盖部位。”","“The knees of his trousers.”"
"“那你看见了什么呢？”","“And what did you see?”"
"“看见了我预计会看见的东西。”","“What I expected to see.”"
"“你干吗敲打人行道呢？”","“Why did you beat the pavement?”"
"“亲爱的医生，眼下这个时间是用来观察，不是用来聊天的。咱们这会儿可是在敌人的土地上搞间谍活动呢。好了，咱们已经对萨克斯-科伯格广场有所了解，接下来该看看它背面的那些地方了。”","“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”"
"我们离开了僻静的萨克斯-科伯格广场，转过街角之后，大路上的景象跟刚才那个地方形成了极其强烈的对比，如同一幅油画的正面与反面。这是从故城通往北区和西区的一条交通要道，浩浩荡荡的商旅河流之中涌起进城出城的两股大潮，街心的路面为之壅塞不通，两边的人行道上也挤满了行色匆匆的路人，望过去只是黑压压的一片。看着路边那一列装潢精美的店铺和富丽堂皇的商业建筑，我俩简直不敢相信，在这些东西的背面，真的就是我俩刚刚走出的那个凋敝零落、死气沉沉的广场。","The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inwards and outwards, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted."
"“让我琢磨琢磨，”福尔摩斯站在街角，顺着路边那列房子往前张望，“我想要记住这些房子的排列次序，我的嗜好之一就是努力搜集关于伦敦的准确知识。这儿有莫蒂默咖啡馆、一家烟具店、一间小报亭、城畿银行的科伯格分行、一家素食餐厅，还有麦克法兰马车制造厂，厂房一直延伸到了前面的一个街区。好了，医生，咱们的正事已经办完，应该去找点儿乐子了。咱们不妨去吃一块三明治，再来杯咖啡，然后就前往小提琴的世界，那里只有甜美、精致与和谐，绝不会有什么红头发的主顾拿着谜语来打搅咱们。”","“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”"
"我这位朋友是个热情很高的音乐家，不光具有高超的演奏水平，作曲的本领也不能等闲视之。这一天，他在音乐厅的前排座位坐了整整一个下午，全身上下都洋溢着无比的喜悦，他那纤长的手指和着音乐的节奏轻轻摇动，那张笑意吟吟的脸庞和那双慵倦蒙眬的眼睛更是比想象范围之内的任何事物都更不像福尔摩斯，不像那个警犬附身的福尔摩斯，不像那个心如铁石、机警敏锐、手到擒来的罪犯天敌。这样的双重特质在他独一无二的个性之中交替显现，而我也常常觉得，他那种极端的严谨与机敏实际上是一种自然的反应，为的是跟偶尔主宰他心灵的诗意与浮想形成制衡。大开大阖的性情让他可以从瘫软如泥的状态之中瞬间爆发出无可阻遏的力量，也让我深切地体会到，如果他一连几天窝在扶手椅上、靠即兴创作的曲子和哥特字体[^14]的旧书消磨光阴，才算是真正进入了他最为强大、最为可怕的状态。接下来，追猎的渴望就会在突然之间将他攫住，而他无与伦比的演绎本领也会上升为一种不假思索的直觉，致使那些对他的方法缺乏认识的人目瞪口呆地仰望着他，如同仰望一个拥有超凡力量的妖巫。这天下午，看到他如此专注地沉浸在圣詹姆斯音乐厅的乐声之中，我不由得心中暗想，对于他正在追猎的那些家伙来说，不祥的结局已经迫在眉睫。","My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes, the sleuthhound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down."
"“你肯定是打算回家了吧，医生，”我俩从音乐厅出来的时候，他说道。","“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged."
"“是啊，该回家了。”","“Yes, it would be as well.”"
"“我手头还有些事情，需要几个钟头的时间才能办完。科伯格广场的这件案子十分严重。”","“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.”"
"“为什么严重呢？”","“Why serious?”"
"“有人正在策划一起严重的罪案。当然，我有充分的理由相信，咱们应该来得及加以制止。可是，考虑到今天是周六，事情就显得比较复杂了。今天晚上，我得借重你的帮助。”","“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”"
"“什么时间？”","“At what time?”"
"“十点钟吧，不能再早了。”","“Ten will be early enough.”"
"“那我就十点钟到贝克街。”","“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”"
"“很好。还有啊，听我说，医生，到时候可能会有一点儿小小的危险，你最好把你当兵时用的那把左轮手枪揣在兜里。”他挥了挥手，跟着就转过身去，即刻消失在了人群之中。","“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd."
"按我自己的感觉，我并不比周围的人们鲁钝，可是，跟歇洛克·福尔摩斯打交道的时候，我总是会意识到自己的愚笨，由此觉得沮丧不已。就拿今天的事情来说吧，他听到的我都听到了，他看见的我也都看见了，可是，他那些话显然已经表明，他不光清楚地知道之前发生了什么事情，还知道接下来将要发生什么事情，我呢，却还是觉得整件事情离奇诡异、无从索解。坐车回肯辛顿街区我自己家的路上，我从头到尾想了想今天的事情，想到那个红头发《大英百科全书》抄写员的奇特故事，想到我和福尔摩斯的萨克斯-科伯格广场之行，又想到他临走时那些预示着危险的话语。稍后的夜间冒险到底是怎么回事，他为什么要我带上武器？我们要去的地方是哪里，去那里做什么？福尔摩斯倒是提醒过我，那个脸蛋光光的当铺伙计是个非常可怕的人，兴许还正在策划一场阴谋。我试着解开这些谜团，最终却还是在绝望之中选择放弃，暂且放下了这件事情，无论如何，晚上就会有答案了吧。","I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation."
"九点一刻，我从家里出发。我走的是穿过公园的那条路，最后就从牛津街转进了贝克街，看到福尔摩斯家的门口停着两辆双轮双座马车。刚走进楼下的过道，我就听见楼上有说话的声音。踏进他的房间之后，我发现他正和两个男人聊得热火朝天，其中一个我认识，是警方探员彼得·琼斯，另一个则身材瘦高、面容哀戚，礼帽打理得熠熠生辉，长礼服气派得让人敬而远之。","It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat."
"“哈！咱们的人到齐了，”福尔摩斯一边说，一边扣上自己的双排扣粗呢上衣，还把搁在架子上的那根沉重猎鞭[^15]拿了下来。“华生，苏格兰场[^16]的琼斯先生你应该认识吧？我来给你介绍一下这位梅里韦瑟先生，他也会加入今天晚上的冒险旅程。”","“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”"
"“您瞧，咱们又要并肩打猎了，医生，”琼斯的口吻还是那么自命不凡。“咱俩的这位朋友可真是擅长组织狩猎活动啊。这一次，他又找了我这条老猎犬来帮他扑倒猎物。”","“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”"
"“我只是希望，咱们追的不会是什么子虚乌有的猎物，”梅里韦瑟先生闷闷不乐地说道。","“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily."
"“您应该对福尔摩斯先生抱有百倍的信心，先生，”探员趾高气扬地说道，“他有他自个儿的一套小小办法，只可惜，希望他听了不要介意，那些方法稍微有一点点稀奇古怪、纸上谈兵。当然，侦探的天赋他还是有的。不过分地说，之前的一两件案子当中，比如那件牵涉到阿格拉宝藏的舒尔托谋杀案[^17]，他的判断的确比警方更接近事实。”","“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.”"
"“哦，琼斯先生，既然您都这么说，那我就放心了，”陌生人对琼斯的话表示尊重。“不过，说老实话，我还是挺惦记我的桥牌比赛的。整整二十七年当中，周六晚上打不成桥牌的经历对我来说还是头一回呢。”","“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”"
"“依我看，您马上就会发现，”歇洛克·福尔摩斯说道，“今晚的彩头比您以往的任何一次牌局都要大，所以呢，这一次的游戏肯定会更加刺激。对您来说，梅里韦瑟先生，今晚的彩头大概有三万镑，你呢，琼斯，你的彩头就是你一直想抓的那个家伙。”","“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some thirty thousand pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.”"
"“约翰·克莱，杀人、偷盗、印钞票、造假货，无所不为。虽然他年纪还轻，梅里韦瑟先生，但却已经成了他那个行当里数一数二的人物，全伦敦的罪犯之中，我最想拿铐子铐上的就是他。说实在的，约翰·克莱这小子还真是不一般。他祖父是王室的一位公爵，他自个儿也在伊顿公学[^18]和牛津大学待过。他手脚利落，脑子也跟手脚一样灵活，我们虽然一次又一次地看到他留下的蛛丝马迹，他本人却始终不见踪影。他头一个星期刚在苏格兰砸烂了一张婴儿床，下一个星期没准儿又会在康沃尔[^19]出现，为兴办孤儿院的事情筹集资金。我追踪了他好些年，但却从来没有亲眼看到过他。”","“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”"
"“我希望，今晚我就能得到把他介绍给你的荣幸。我也跟约翰·克莱先生打过一两次交道，完全同意你的看法，他的确是他那个行当里数一数二的人物。不过，眼下已经十点多了，咱们还是赶紧出发吧。你们俩坐第一辆马车好了，我和华生在后面跟着。”","“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight. I’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.”"
"这段路虽然很长，歇洛克·福尔摩斯却没怎么开口说话，只是自顾自地倚在车座上，嘴里哼着今天下午刚刚听过的那些曲调。点着煤气路灯的一条条街道宛如一座没有尽头的迷宫，我们的马车就在这座迷宫里辚辚驶过，一直跑到了法灵顿街。","Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street."
"“咱们就要到了，”我朋友开了口。“这个梅里韦瑟是一名银行董事，这事情关系到他的切身利益。后来我又觉得，把琼斯一块儿叫上也不错。他这人不坏，只不过办案的时候完全是个低能儿。他只有一样好处，那就是勇敢得像只牛头犬，同时又犟得跟龙虾一样，钳子一夹到谁就再也不会松开。好啦，咱们已经到了，他俩在等咱们呢。”","“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”"
"脚下的这条通衢我俩上午刚刚来过，此时也跟上午一样人潮汹涌。我们打发走了马车，然后就跟着梅里韦瑟先生穿过一条狭窄的过道，走进了他为我们打开的一道侧门。门里面有一条狭窄的走廊，走廊尽头是一道巨大的铁门。铁门开了之后，我们走下一段曲折的石头台阶，台阶尽头是又一道无比坚固的大门。梅里韦瑟先生停了一停，点起一盏提灯，然后就领着我们走进了一条散发着泥土气息的黑暗过道。这么着，打开第三道大门之后，我们就进入了一个巨大的保险库或者地下室，身边堆满了板条箱，还有一些硕大的盒子。","We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes."
"“从上方下手的话，你们这儿还是不太容易攻破的，”福尔摩斯一边说，一边举着提灯四处张望。","“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him."
"“下方也一样，”梅里韦瑟先生说道，说着就用自己的手杖敲了敲铺在地上的石板。“怎么回事，天哪，听声音，下面好像是空的啊！”说完之后，他惊愕地抬起了头。","“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise."
"“我真的要请您安静一点儿！”福尔摩斯的口气十分严厉。“您已经给我们的行动带来了彻底失败的危险。麻烦您行行好，找个箱子坐下，别再管这件事情，行吗？”","“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”"
"庄重威严的梅里韦瑟先生在一只板条箱上坐了下来，脸上是一副伤得不轻的表情。与此同时，福尔摩斯跪到地上，开始用提灯和放大镜仔细检查石板之间的缝隙。短短几秒钟之内，他得到了满意的结果，于是便一跃而起，把放大镜放回了兜里。","The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket."
"“咱们至少还有一个钟头的时间，”他说道，“不等到那位实心眼儿的当铺掌柜安然就寝，他们是不会采取任何行动的。那之后，他们就会争分夺秒地立刻动手，因为收工越早，逃跑的时间也就越充裕。眼下呢，医生，你肯定也猜到了，咱们是在伦敦一家大银行的故城分行，在他们的地下室里。梅里韦瑟先生是这家银行的董事会主席，让他给你解释一下吧，目前这个时候，伦敦那些胆子比较大的罪犯为什么会对这个地下室产生这么大的兴趣。”","“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”"
"“他们是冲我们的法国黄金来的，”董事先生低声说道，“我们已经接到了几次警告，说有人可能会打它的主意。”","“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”"
"“你们的法国黄金？”","“Your French gold?”"
"“是的。几个月之前，我们需要充实自己的资金储备，因此就从法兰西银行借来了三万枚拿破仑金币。到后来，消息传了出去，大家都知道我们始终没有动用这笔资金，知道这些金币仍然放在我们的地下室里。我现在坐的这只板条箱里就装着二千枚拿破仑金币，中间还垫着一层层锡箔。这个分行目前存放的黄金远远超过了一间分行通常的储备量，董事们一直都很担心这件事情。”","“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose thirty thousand napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains two thousand napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”"
"“你们的担心完全有理有据，”福尔摩斯说道，“好了，咱们该制订一个小小的作战计划了。据我估计，一个钟头之内，千钧一发的时刻就会来临。对了，梅里韦瑟先生，咱们必须得把这盏提灯的挡板放下来。”","“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “ And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime, Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”"
"“那不就得坐在黑暗里了吗？”","“And sit in the dark?”"
"“我看是只能如此。其实我带了一副牌在身上，本来是这么想的，既然咱们四个刚好可以凑成两对[^20]，您兴许终归可以打上桥牌。可是，我发现敌人的准备十分周详，咱们不能冒险让他们瞧见光亮。好了，咱们要办的第一件事情就是找好各人的位置。那些人可都是胆大包天，咱们虽然可以打他们一个措手不及，不留神的话也会伤在他们手里。我准备站在这只板条箱后面，你们就躲在那堆箱子背后。然后呢，一旦我把灯光投到他们身上，你们就赶紧围上来。要是他们开火的话，华生，你就用枪把他们撂倒，可不要觉得过意不去。”","“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a *partie carrée*, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”"
"我蜷在一只木箱背后，拉开左轮手枪的保险，把枪架在了箱子上。福尔摩斯把提灯前端的挡板拉了下来，周围立刻变得漆黑一片。这么彻底的黑暗，我以前还没有见识过。不过，金属受热所散发的气味依然在告诉我们，灯光并没有熄灭，瞬间的动作就可以把它释放出来。我的神经已经被等待的焦灼搞得异常兴奋，此时就禁不住产生了一种沉重压抑的感觉，一方面是因为这种突如其来的黑暗，一方面是因为地下室里的阴冷空气。","I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault."
"“他们只有一条退路，”福尔摩斯悄声说道，“那就是从这里倒回去，通过那座房子逃进萨克斯-科伯格广场。你应该已经按我的要求安排好了吧，琼斯？”","“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?”"
"“我派了一名督察[^21]和两名警员在房子的前门守着。”","“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”"
"“这么说，咱们已经封死了所有的洞口。好了，咱们都别说话，就这么等着。”","“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”"
"时间可真是漫长！后来我们对了一下表，发现我们只等了一小时十五分钟，可是，我当时的感觉却是这个夜晚就要过去、外面的天恐怕都开始亮了。我不敢改变姿势，结果就把自己的手脚弄得又乏又僵；与此同时，我的神经却达到了极度兴奋的状态，听觉也变得无比敏锐，不但可以听到同伴们轻微的呼吸，还可以听出呼吸之间的区别，略显深沉粗重的吸气声来自身材健硕的琼斯，叹息一般的纤细声响则来自那位银行董事。躲在目前的这个位置，我可以从箱子顶上往地板的方向张望。突然之间，我眼前出现了一点亮光。","What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the  glint of a light."
"刚开始，那只是石头地板上的一点诡异火星。接下来，火星越拉越长，变成了一条黄色的亮线，再下来，没有任何征兆，也没有任何声响，地板上已经凭空多出了一道裂缝，一只手出现在了裂缝里。那是一只白得有点儿脂粉气的手，在那片小小光亮的中央探来探去，手指还不停地扭动。至少过了一分钟的时间，那只手的高度才超过了地板。紧接着，那只手缩了回去，跟出现的时候一样突然，眼前又变得漆黑一片，剩下的只有那个从石头罅隙里透出来的诡异火星。","At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones."
"不过，这样的情形只持续了短短的片刻。只听得一声震耳的巨响，地上那些白色的大石板有一块突然翻了个个儿，露出一个深深的方形洞口，提灯的光线从洞口涌了上来。一张刮得干干净净、带着几分孩子气的脸探到洞口外面，仔仔细细地张望了一番。紧接着，两只手分别搭到了洞的两边，这张脸便越升越高，渐渐露出了下面的肩头和腰身，到最后，一只膝盖搁到了洞口边缘。转眼之间，来人已经站在了洞口，后面还跟了一个同伴。同伴跟他本人一样灵活瘦小，长着一张苍白的脸和一头十分鲜艳的红发。","Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair."
"“一切正常，”来人低声说道，“你的凿子和袋子呢？糟了！快跑，阿奇，快跑，死罪由我来顶着！”","“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”"
"说时迟那时快，歇洛克·福尔摩斯已经跳了出去，一把揪住了来人的衣领。另一名闯入者纵身跳进地洞，琼斯连忙抓住那人的衣服下摆，我立刻听到了衣服撕裂的声音。灯光映出一把左轮手枪的枪管，可福尔摩斯的猎鞭已经抽到了来人的手腕，“咣当”一声，手枪砸在了石头地板上。","Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes’s hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor."
"“没用的，约翰·克莱，”福尔摩斯温和地说道，“你根本就没有逃跑的机会。”","“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”"
"“我也看出来了，”对方的口气平静得无以复加。“可我知道，我的伙伴已经安全了，虽然我看得见，他的衣角落在了你们手里。”","“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coattails.”"
"“有三个人在那边的门口等他呢，”福尔摩斯说道。","“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes."
"“噢，真的啊！你们这件事情还办得挺仔细的嘛，我得夸夸你们。”","“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.”"
"“彼此彼此，”福尔摩斯回答道，“你那个红头发的点子非常新颖，效果也相当不错。”","“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.”"
"“你很快就能见到你的伙伴，”琼斯说道，“因为他钻地洞的速度可比我快多了。把手伸出来，我好给你戴上镯子。”","“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”"
"“麻烦你，别把你那双脏手伸到我身上，”手铐“咔嗒”一声合上的时候，我们的犯人说道，“你们兴许还不知道吧，我身上可流着王室的血液呢。麻烦你们，跟我说话的时候，一定不能忘了加上‘阁下’和‘请’。”","“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’ ”"
"“好吧，”琼斯先是瞪了他一眼，跟着又吃吃地笑了一笑。“那么，阁下，请您移驾上楼，好让我们找辆马车送阁下去警局，可以吗？”","“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry Your Highness to the police-station?”"
"“这还差不多，”约翰·克莱泰然自若地说道。他飞快地冲我们三人稍稍鞠了个躬，然后就默不作声地在探员的押送之下走了出去。","“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective."
"“说真的，福尔摩斯先生，”我们三人跟着他俩走出地下室的时候，梅里韦瑟先生说道，“我真不知道我们的银行该怎样感谢您，又该怎样酬报您的功劳。您刚刚以一种滴水不漏的方式查明并挫败了一起险恶程度前所罕有的银行劫案，确实让我心服口服。”","“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.”"
"“即便没有这件事情，我自己也有一两笔小账要跟约翰·克莱先生算一算，”“办这件案子产生了一点小小的费用，福尔摩斯说道,我希望银行方面可以报销，其他就不必了，我有了一次在诸多方面都堪称独一无二的经历，又听到了关于红发俱乐部的那个非凡故事，由此已经得到了极大的回报。”","“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-Headed League.”"
"“你得明白，华生，”凌晨时分，我俩正在贝克街喝威士忌加苏打水，福尔摩斯开始向我解释。“这案子从一开始就非常明显，红发俱乐部的启事也好，抄写《大英百科全书》的工作也罢，这些事情虽然相当古怪，目的却只可能有一个，就是让那位脑子不算特别灵光的当铺掌柜每天离开几个小时，免得挡了别人的道。这种支开障碍的招数确实很不寻常，不过，说实在话，更好的招数还真是不容易找。毫无疑问，脑子非常好使的克莱之所以能够想到这种招数，肯定也是受了同伙头发颜色的启发。开出四镑的周薪，当铺老板就必然会上钩，再者说，这些家伙做的是成千上万的买卖，这点钱对他们来说又算得了什么呢？这么着，两个无赖登出启事，一个无赖待在临时租来的办公室里，另一个无赖撺掇当铺老板去应征，两个无赖再合力保证他每个工作日的上午都不在家里。一听说那个伙计只要一半的工钱，我就清楚地意识到，他如此急于得到这个职位，一定有什么相当重大的图谋。”","“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopedia, must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The four pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”"
"“可是，他们的图谋具体是什么，你是怎么猜出来的呢？”","“But how could you guess what the motive was?”"
"“要是当铺里有女人的话，我多半会觉得，这仅仅是一起格调低下的桃色事件。可是，事实证明这种可能性并不存在。当铺的生意非常小，铺子里的哪一件东西也不值得他们如此大费周章、还赔上这许多的费用。如此说来，他们想要的玩意儿一定是在房子外面。究竟是什么玩意儿呢？我想起了这个伙计的照相嗜好，还有他老在地下室里赖着的那套把戏。没错，就是地下室！这团乱麻的线头就在这里。这之后，我问了几个关于这个神秘伙计的问题，结果就发现，我需要对付的竟然是全伦敦头脑最冷静、胆量最惊人的罪犯之一。他肯定是在地下室里搞某种玩意儿，某种需要他每天花上许多个小时、连续搞上几个月的玩意儿。那么，我们再问一次，究竟是什么玩意儿呢？我只能想出一个答案，也就是说，他打算挖一条通往其他建筑的地道。","“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building."
"“咱们去勘查现场的时候，我已经知道了上面说的这些事情。看见我用手杖敲打人行道的时候，你还觉得非常惊讶哩。实际呢，当时我只是想检验一下，地下室在房子下面往外延伸，究竟是向前还是向后。检验的结果是，它并没有向房子的前方延伸。于是我拉响门铃，然后呢，如我所愿，当铺的伙计出来开了门。以前我跟他小小地较量过几次，但却从来没有跟他打过照面。他开门之后，我基本上没看他的脸，他的膝盖则正好符合我的预期。当时你一定也注意到了，他裤子的膝盖部位有多少的磨损痕迹、多少的褶皱，又有多少的污渍，这些东西全都在诉说他无数个钟头的挖掘工作。好了，现在只剩下一个问题，也就是说，他这些挖掘工作为的是什么。我转过街角，看到城畿银行正好在我们主顾那间铺子的背面，于是就觉得，我的问题已经有了答案。听完演奏会之后，你坐车回了家，我却跑去拜访了一下苏格兰场，然后又拜访了一下银行的董事会主席，结果嘛，你已经亲眼看到了。”","“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”"
"“那么，你凭什么确定他们会在昨天夜里动手呢？”","“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I asked."
"“这个嘛，他们既然关掉了俱乐部的办公室，说明他们已经不再关心杰贝兹·威尔逊先生是否在家。换句话说，他们已经挖通了地道。对他们来说，至关重要的事情就是赶紧让地道派上用场，因为地道可能会被人发现，黄金也可能被转移到别的地方。周六比其他任何日子都更加适合他们，原因是这样一来，他们就有两天的逃跑时间。所有这些理由都让我断定，他们会在昨天夜里动手。”","“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence— in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”"
"“你这番演绎真是妙极了，”我击节叫好，心里也佩服得五体投地。“这么长的一根链条，每个环节却都是无懈可击。”","“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”"
"“它可以让我摆脱无聊，”他打着哈欠回答道，“唉！说着说着，我已经又开始觉得无聊了。我的人生就是一场漫长的逃亡，为的是摆脱平淡庸碌的存在状态。就这个方面来说，这些小小的问题对我不无裨益。”","“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”"
"“而你却有益于整个人类，”我说道。","“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I."
"他耸了耸肩。“呃，也许吧，说到底，我的人生多少还是有点儿用的，”他如是说道。“古斯塔夫·福楼拜在给乔治·桑的信中说得好，‘作者毫无意义——作品意义无穷’。[^22]”","He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked. “‘*L’homme c’est rien*—*l’œuvre c’est tout*,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”"
