"缆车又颠簸了一下，然后停了下来。缆车开不过去了，大雪结结实实地堆积在车道上。席卷高山裸露表层的狂风把表面的雪刮成了一层挡风板似的硬壳。尼克正在行李车厢里给他的滑雪板打蜡，他把靴子塞进靴尖铁夹里，然后牢牢地扣上了夹子。他斜着从车厢跳到坚硬的雪壳上，做了一个弹跳旋转，然后弯腰屈膝，撑着滑雪杖迅速滑下了山坡。","The funicular car bucked once more and then stopped.It could not go farther, the snow drifted solidly across the track.The gale scouring the exposed surface of the mountain had swept the snow surface into a wind-board crust.Nick, waxing his skis in the baggage car, pushed his boots into the toe irons and shut the clamp tight.He jumped from the car sideways onto the hard wind-board, made a jump turn and crouching and trailing his sticks slipped in a rush down the slope."
"乔治在下面的白雪中起起落落，然后就不见踪影了。当尼克在起伏很大的山的一侧滑下去时，那急速和突然的猛冲使得尼克忘却了一切，只觉得身体有种奇妙的飞翔和下坠的感觉。他挺起身来了个稍微上滑的姿势，然后他往下滑，往下滑，越滑越快，越滑越快，冲到最后一个陡峭的长坡时，雪似乎从他的脚下掉落了。他向下蹲伏，几乎坐在了滑雪板上，为的是尽量降低重心，而积雪就像沙尘暴一样迎面飞过，他意识到他的速度太快了。但他控制住了速度。他不会失手摔下去的。然而一团被风刮进坑里的松软的雪将他绊倒了。在滑雪板的撞击中，他连翻了几个跟头，感觉自己就像被枪击中的兔子一样。接着便动弹不得了，双腿交叉着，滑雪板朝上竖起，鼻子和耳朵里全是雪。","On the white below George dipped and rose and dipped out of sight.The rush and the sudden swoop as he dropped down a steep undulation in the mountain side plucked Nick’s mind out and left him only the wonderful flying, dropping sensation in his body.He rose to a slight up-run and then the snow seemed to drop out from under him as he went down, down, faster and faster in a rush down the last, long steep slope.Crouching so he was almost sitting back on his skis, trying to keep the center of gravity low, the snow driving like a sand-storm, he knew the pace was too much.But he held it.He would not let go and spill.Then a patch of soft snow, left in a hollow by the wind, spilled him and he went over and over in a clashing of skis, feeling like a shot rabbit, then stuck, his legs crossed, his skis sticking straight up and his nose and ears jammed full of snow."
"乔治在斜坡上稍远的地方，用力拍打着防风衣上的雪。","George stood a little farther down the slope, knocking the snow from his wind jacket with big slaps."
"“你的动作真漂亮，尼克。”他朝尼克喊道，“那糟糕的软绵绵的雪。它同样绊了我一跤。”","“You took a beauty, Nick,” he called to Nick.“That’s lousy soft snow.It bagged me the same way.”"
"“在峡谷滑雪会是怎样的呢？”尼克躺着，将滑雪板踢来踢去，然后站了起来。","“What’s it like over the khud?”Nick kicked his skis around as he lay on his back and stood up."
"“你得靠左滑。因为谷底有栅栏，快速冲下去时得来个高速制动转弯。”","“You’ve got to keep to your left.It’s a good fast drop with a Christy at the bottom on account of a fence.”"
"“等一下，咱们一起去滑。”","“Wait a sec and we’ll take it together.”"
"“不，你快点先去滑。我想看看你滑下峡谷。”","“No, you come on and go first.I like to see you take the khuds.”"
"尼克·亚当斯赶超过了乔治，他宽大的背部和金黄的头发上仍隐约沾着雪，然后他的滑雪板开始侧滑，之后往下猛冲，在晶莹的粉末状雪上发出咝咝声。他在如波浪般起伏的峡谷滑上滑下，就像浮上来又沉下去一样。他一直靠左滑，最后，当他冲向栅栏时，双膝紧紧并拢，像拧螺丝似的旋转身体，把滑雪板猛地转向右侧，擦起一片积雪；而后，他慢慢减速，和山坡和铁丝栅栏平行滑行。","Nick Adams came up past George, big back and blond head still faintly snowy, then his skis started slipping at the edge and he swooped down, hissing in the crystalline powder snow and seeming to float up and drop down as he went up and down the billowing khuds.He held to his left and at the end, as he rushed toward the fence, keeping his knees locked tight together and turning his body like tightening a screw brought his skis sharply around to the right in a smother of snow and slowed into a loss of speed parallel to the hillside and the wire fence."
"他望了望山上。乔治正屈膝，用弓步式转弯的姿势滑下来；一条腿在前面弯着，另一条腿拖在后面；滑雪杖像某种昆虫的细腿一样在悬在空中，碰到地面时，则掀起阵阵雪花；最终，保持着一条腿屈膝而另一条腿拖地的乔治整个身子以漂亮的右弧线绕了过来。他蹲伏着，双腿一前一后，身体前倾，以避免旋转，两支滑雪杖像两个光点把弧线衬托得更加明显，这一切都笼罩在一阵暴雪中。","He looked up the hill.George was coming down in telemark position, kneeling; one leg forward and bent, the other trailing; his sticks hanging like some insect’s thin legs, kicking up puffs of snow as they touched the surface and finally the whole kneeling, trailing figure coming around in a beautiful right curve, crouching, the legs shot forward and back, the body leaning out against the swing, the sticks accenting the curve like points of light, all in a wild cloud of snow."
"“我就怕制动转弯。”乔治说道，“雪太深了。你干得很漂亮。”","“I was afraid to Christy,” George said, “the snow was too deep.You made a beauty.”"
"“我的腿也做不了弓步式转弯。”尼克说道。","“I can’t telemark with my leg,” Nick said."
"尼克用滑雪板压低了铁丝栅栏上端的铁丝，乔治滑了过来。尼克跟着他来到大路上。他们沿着大路屈膝快速滑进一片松树林。路上结着光亮的冰层，冰层被运送原木的车队沾染得一片橙红，一片烟黄的。两个滑雪的人一直沿着路边的一片雪地滑行。大路陡直地通向小溪，然后又直通向山坡。透过林子，他们看到一座长长的、饱经风吹雨打的低屋檐建筑。透过树林看，房子已泛黄。近一些看，窗框被漆成了绿色。上面的油漆在脱落。尼克用一支滑雪杖敲松了滑雪板的夹子，然后踢下了滑雪板。","Nick held down the top strand of the wire fence with his ski and George slid over.Nick followed him down to the road.They thrust bent-kneed along the road into a pine forest.The road became polished ice, stained orange and a tobacco yellow from the teams hauling logs.The skiers kept to the stretch of snow along the side.The road dipped sharply to a stream and then ran straight up-hill.Through the woods they could see a long, low-eaved, weather-beaten building.Through the trees it was a faded yellow.Closer the window frames were painted green.The paint was peeling.Nick knocked his clamps loose with one of his ski sticks and kicked off the skis."
"“咱们还是带着滑雪板上去好。”他说道。","“We might as well carry them up here,” he said."
"他肩上扛着滑雪板，一边爬着陡峭的路，一边把靴跟的脚钉踢进脚下结着冰的路面。他听到乔治在他后面一边喘息，一边踢着脚跟。他们把滑雪板堆在客栈的墙边，拍打掉彼此裤子上的雪，跺干净靴子后进去了。","He climbed the steep road with the skis on his shoulder, kicking his heel nails into the icy footing.He heard George breathing and kicking in his heels just behind him.They stacked the skis against the side of the inn and slapped the snow off each other’s trousers, stamped their boots clean, and went in."
"客栈里面十分昏暗。一个大瓷炉子在屋子的角落里透着光。天花板很低。房间四周带着酒渍的暗黑色桌子后都摆着光滑的长凳。两个瑞士人坐在炉边，一边抽烟斗，一边喝着两杯浑浊的新酒。尼克和乔治脱掉夹克衫，靠墙坐在炉子的另一边。隔壁屋子唱歌的声音停住了，一个系着蓝色围裙的姑娘从门口走进来看看他们有什么想喝的。","Inside it was quite dark.A big porcelain stove shone in the corner of the room.There was a low ceiling.Smooth benches back of dark, wine-stained tables were along each side of the rooms.Two Swiss sat over their pipes and two decies of cloudy new wine next to the stove.The boys took off their jackets and sat against the wall on the other side of the stove.A voice in the next room stopped singing and a girl in a blue apron came in through the door to see what they wanted to drink."
"“一瓶锡永酒。”尼克说道。“行吗，吉奇？”","“A bottle of Sion,” Nick said.“Is that all right, Gidge?”"
"“当然可以。”乔治说道。“对于酒你比我懂得多。我什么酒都喜欢。”","“Sure,” said George.“You know more about wine than I do.I like any of it.”"
"那姑娘出去了。","The girl went out."
"“没有什么真正比得上滑雪的，是不是呀？”尼克说道，“当你滑了好长一段路，头一回停下来的时候就是这种感觉。”","“There’s nothing really can touch skiing, is there?” Nick said.“The way it feels when you first drop off on a long run.”"
"“哈。”乔治说道，“真是棒得无法形容。”","“Huh,” said George.“It’s too swell to talk about.”"
"那姑娘拿来了酒，但他们怎么也打不开瓶塞。最终尼克打开了它。那姑娘出去了，他们听到她在隔壁房间唱德语歌。","The girl brought the wine in and they had trouble with the cork.Nick finally opened it.The girl went out and they heard her singing in German in the next room."
"“酒里的这些瓶塞末没关系的。”尼克说道。","“Those specks of cork in it don’t matter,” said Nick."
"“我在想她这儿是否有糕点。”","“I wonder if she’s got any cake.”"
"“咱们问问。”","“Let’s find out.”"
"那姑娘进来了，尼克注意到她的围裙高高隆起，遮着大肚子。她刚进来时我怎么没看见，他想。","The girl came in and Nick noticed that her apron covered swellingly her pregnancy.I wonder why I didn’t see that when she first came in, he thought."
"“你刚才在唱什么？”他问她。","“What were you singing?” he asked her."
"“歌剧，德国歌剧。”她不想谈论这个话题。“如果你们需要，我们有苹果馅卷饼。”","“Opera, German opera.”She did not care to discuss the subject.“We have some apple strudel if you want it.”"
"“她不是很热情，是吧？”乔治说道。","“She isn’t so cordial, is she?” said George."
"“哦，算了。她不认识咱们，可能她认为咱们要拿她唱歌开玩笑呢。她很可能来自说德语的地方，呆在这里让她脾气变坏，而且她没结婚就怀了孩子，脾气变得暴躁。","“Oh, well.She doesn’t know us and she thought we were going to kid her about her singing, maybe.She’s from up where they speak German probably and she’s touchy about being here and then she’s got that baby coming without being married and she’s touchy.”"
"“你怎么知道她没结婚？”","“How do you know she isn’t married?”"
"“她没戴戒指。该死，这儿的姑娘都是被搞大了肚子才结婚。”","“No ring.Hell, no girls get married around here till they’re knocked up.”"
"门开了，一帮伐木工人从大路那边进来了，他们在屋里跺着靴子，身上冒着水汽。女侍者给这帮人拿来了三升新酒，他们分坐了两桌，摘掉帽子，默默地抽着烟，有的背靠着墙，有的则伏在桌子上。屋外，拉木雪橇的马偶尔一仰脖，就将脖子上的铃铛晃得叮当作响。","The door came open and a gang of woodcutters from up the road came in, stamping their boots and steaming in the room.The waitress brought in three litres of new wine for the gang and they sat at the two tables, smoking and quiet, with their hats off, leaning back against the wall or forward on the table.Outside the horses on the wood sledges made an occasional sharp jangle of bells as they tossed their heads."
"乔治和尼克很高兴。他们喜欢彼此。他们知道要回家就得跑一段路了。","George and Nick were happy.They were fond of each other.They knew they had the run back home ahead of them."
"“你什么时候得回学校呀？”尼克问道。","“When have you got to go back to school?” Nick asked."
"“今晚。”乔治回答道，“我得赶十点四十分从蒙特勒来的车。”","“Tonight,” George answered.“I’ve got to get the ten-forty from Montreux.”"
"“我希望你能留下，这样咱们明天就能滑雪了。”","“I wish you could stick over and we could do the Dent du Lys tomorrow.”"
"“我得上学呀。”乔治说道，“哎呀，尼克，难道你不希望咱们能在一起闲逛吗？带上咱们的滑雪板，乘火车去好的滑雪处,再继续上路，投宿在客栈，然后穿越奥伯朗特，到瓦莱州，再穿遍恩加丁，帆布背包里就只带着修理工具和换洗的毛衣和睡衣，学校或其他的事才不管它呢。”“是呀，就那样穿越黑林山。哎呀，很棒的地方。”","“I got to get educated,” George said.“Gee, Nick, don’t you wish we could just bum together?Take our skis and go on the train to where there was good running and then go on and put up at pubs and go right across the Oberland and up the Valais and all through the Engadine and just take repair kit and extra sweaters and pyjamas in our rucksacks and not give a damn about school or anything.”“Yes, and go through the Schwarzwald that way.Gee, the swell places.”"
"“那是你去年夏天钓鱼的地方，不是吗？”","“That’s where you went fishing last summer, isn’t it?”"
"“是呀。”","“Yes.”"
"他们吃着苹果馅卷饼，喝着剩下的酒。","They ate the strudel and drank the rest of the wine."
"乔治背靠着墙，闭上了眼睛。","George leaned back against the wall and shut his eyes."
"“酒总给我这种感觉。”他说道。","“Wine always makes me feel this way,” he said."
"“感觉不好吗？”尼克说道。","“Feel bad?” Nick asked."
"“不。我感觉挺好，就是怪怪的。","“No.I feel good, but funny.”"
"“我知道。”尼克说道。","“I know,” Nick said."
"“当然。”乔治说道。","“Sure,” said George."
"“咱们再来一瓶怎样？”尼克问道。","“Should we have another bottle?” Nick asked."
"“我不要了。”乔治说道。","“Not for me,” George said."
"他们坐在那里，尼克把胳膊肘撑在桌子上，乔治靠墙团坐着。","They sat there, Nick leaning his elbows on the table, George slumped back against the wall."
"“海伦要生孩子了吧？”乔治说道，从墙边凑到桌边。","“Is Helen going to have a baby?”George said, coming down to the table from the wall."
"“是呀。”","“Yes.”"
"“什么时候呢？”","“When?”"
"“明年夏末。”","“Late next summer.”"
"“你高兴吗？”","“Are you glad?”"
"“高兴。现在。”","“Yes.Now.”"
"“你打算回美国吗？”","“Will you go back to the States?”"
"“我想会的。”","“I guess so.”"
"“你想回吗？”","“Do you want to?”"
"“不想。”","“No.”"
"“海伦呢？”","“Does Helen?”"
"“不想。”","“No.”"
"乔治默不作声地坐着。他看着空酒瓶和空酒杯。","George sat silent.He looked at the empty bottle and the empty glasses."
"“糟透了，不是吗？”他说道。","“It’s hell, isn’t it?” he said."
"“不。还说不上。”尼克说道。","“No.Not exactly,” Nick said."
"“为什么不呢？”","“Why not?”"
"“我不知道。”尼克说道。","“I don’t know,” Nick said."
"“在美国你们会一起滑雪吗?”乔治说道。","“Will you ever go skiing together in the States?” George said."
"“我不知道。”尼克说道。","“I don’t know,” said Nick."
"“山不多。”乔治说道。","“The mountains aren’t many,” George said."
"“不是。”尼克说道。“岩石太多。树木也太多，而且太远。”","“No,” said Nick.“They’re too rocky.There’s too much timber and they’re too far away.”"
"“是呀，”乔治说道，“加利福尼亚就是这样。”","“Yes,” said George, “that’s the way it is in California.”"
"“是的，”尼克说道，“我到过的地方都是这样。”","“Yes,” Nick said, “that’s the way it is everywhere I’ve ever been.”"
"“是呀，”乔治说道，“就是这样。”","“Yes,” said George, “that’s the way it is.”"
"瑞士人站起来，付了钱，走了出去。","The Swiss got up and paid and went out."
"“我真希望咱们是瑞士人。”乔治说道。","“I wish we were Swiss,” George said."
"“他们都得大脖子病。”尼克说道。","“They’ve all got goiter,” said Nick."
"“我不相信。”乔治说道。","“I don’t believe it,” George said."
"“我也不信。”尼克说道。","“Neither do I,” said Nick."
"他们大笑起来。","They laughed."
"“也许咱们再也不会滑雪了，尼克。”乔治说道。","“Maybe we’ll never go skiing again, Nick,” George said."
"“咱们一定得滑。”尼克说道，“要是不能滑，就没有意义了。”","“We’ve got to,” said Nick.“It isn’t worth while if you can’t.”"
"“咱们会滑的，没错。”乔治说道。","“We’ll go, all right,” George said."
"“咱们一定得滑。”尼克表示同意。","“We’ve got to,” Nick agreed."
"“我希望咱们能就此许诺。”乔治说道。","“I wish we could make a promise about it,” George said."
"尼克站起身。他把防风衣扣紧。他朝乔治弯下身子，拎起靠墙的两支滑雪杖。他把一支滑雪杖插在地上。","Nick stood up.He buckled his wind jacket tight.He leaned over George and picked up the two ski poles from against the wall.He stuck one of the ski poles into the floor."
"“许诺没什么好处。”他说道。","“There isn’t any good in promising,” he said."
"他们打开门出去了。天气很冷。雪上结了坚硬的冰。道路从山上通向松树林。","They opened the door and went out.It was very cold.The snow had crusted hard.The road ran up the hill into the pine trees."
"他们拿起放在客栈墙边的滑雪板。尼克戴上手套。乔治已经上路了，肩上扛着滑雪板。现在他们要一起跑回家了。","They took down their skis from where they leaned against the wall in the inn.Nick put on his gloves.George was already started up the road, his skis on his shoulder.Now they would have the run home together."
