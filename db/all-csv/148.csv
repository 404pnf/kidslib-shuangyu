"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"从刊登于波士顿《广告人》报纸的一篇文章里,我节选了下面这段话：","I take the following paragraph from an article in the Boston ADVERTISER:"
"“‘研究马克·吐温的一位英国评论家。’","AN ENGLISH CRITIC ON MARK TWAIN"
"或许马克·吐温那些最成功的幽默灵感就源于他对那些根本不欣赏他幽默的人群的描述。我们熟知加利福尼亚人，他们会对马克·吐温以滑稽讽刺的口吻模仿报刊记者讲述故事的方式感到惊恐。我们也听说过宾夕法尼亚州的牧师伤心地将他的《傻瓜国外旅行记》还给书商时说：“能在亚当墓前流泪的人肯定是个傻瓜。”但是现在，马克·吐温可能会在他一系列佳作之后，再添一部更值得称颂的作品。十月八号的《星期六评论》中，他的游记受到了细致的评价。这本书已于英国再版。我们可以想象得到这位幽默家读到他人对自己能力的称赞时那种愉悦的心情。有趣的是，他所能做到的仅仅是在自己下个月的备忘录里完整再现这篇文章。”","Perhaps the most successful flights of humor of Mark Twain have been descriptions of the persons who did not appreciate his humor at all.We have become familiar with the Californians who were thrilled with terror by his burlesque of a newspaper reporter’s way of telling a story, and we have heard of the Pennsylvania clergyman who sadly returned his INNOCENTS ABROAD to the book-agent with the remark that “the man who could shed tears over the tomb of Adam must be an idiot.”But Mark Twain may now add a much more glorious instance to his string of trophies.The SATURDAY REVIEW, in its number of October 8th, reviews his book of travels, which has been republished in England, and reviews it seriously.We can imagine the delight of the humorist in reading this tribute to his power; and indeed it is so amusing in itself that he can hardly do better than reproduce the article in full in his next monthly Memoranda."
"（上面这段话的发表，让我有权力在本文中全文再现《星期六评论》中的那篇文章。我非常希望能够这样做，因为我自己是写不出哪怕只抵得上它一半好的文章来的。如果我有条铁狗在读了这篇英国的评论后还能继续保持严肃，我将会把它赶出门去。）","(Publishing the above paragraph thus, gives me a sort of authority for reproducing the SATURDAY REVIEW’S article in full in these pages.I dearly wanted to do it, for I cannot write anything half so delicious myself.If I had a cast-iron dog that could read this English criticism and preserve his austerity, I would drive him off the door-step.)"
"（摘自伦敦《星期六评论》）","(From the London “Saturday Review.”)"
"《新书评论》","REVIEWS OF NEW BOOKS"
"《傻瓜国外旅行记》一本游记马克·吐温著伦敦：霍尔顿出版公司，1870年出版。","THE INNOCENTS ABROAD.A Book of Travels.By Mark Twain.London: Hotten, publisher. 1870."
"麦考利勋爵去世过早。我们从未如此深刻地意识到这一点，直到我们读完上文中提到过的那本夸张的作品的最后一章。麦考利勋爵去世过早。因为除他之外，没有人能够彻底全面地评价这本书作者那根深蒂固的严重无知，傲慢、无礼、自以为是和虚伪。","Lord Macaulay died too soon.We never felt this so deeply as when we finished the last chapter of the above-named extravagant work.Macaulay died too soon—for none but he could mete out complete and comprehensive justice to the insolence, the impertinence, the presumption, the mendacity, and, above all, the majestic ignorance of this author."
"若要说《傻瓜国外旅行记》是本奇特的书，那是指作者用了最苍白无力的语言——比如用“纯粹的高度”来形容马特洪峰，或是用“不错”或“美丽”来形容尼亚加拉瀑布。“奇特”这个词过于平淡，不足以表现这部作品中那些让人印象深刻的极端愚蠢的部分。没有一个词的内涵足够宽广、意义足够深远到能够描述那种愚蠢。因此，让我们来快速地回看一下这本书及其作者，剩下的就相信读者自己的判断吧！请这位对人性有研究的英国学生想象一下马克·吐温是一个能做出以下行为的人。并且，他不仅仅能做出那些行为，他还能以令人难以置信的天真无知，平静自如地将其行为写进书里。比如：","To say that the INNOCENTS ABROAD is a curious book, would be to use the faintest language—would be to speak of the Matterhorn as a neat elevation or of Niagara as being “nice” or “pretty.”“Curious” is too tame a word wherewith to describe the imposing insanity of this work.There is no word that is large enough or long enough.Let us, therefore, photograph a passing glimpse of book and author, and trust the rest to the reader.Let the cultivated English student of human nature picture to himself this Mark Twain as a person capable of doing the following-described things—and not only doing them, but with incredible innocence PRINTING THEM calmly and tranquilly in a book.For instance:"
"他讲述到他曾去巴黎一家理发店剃胡须，理发师“剃”第一下就让他的“头皮”松弛下来，并且从椅子上跳了起来。","He states that he entered a hair-dresser’s in Paris to get shaved, and the first “rake” the barber gave him with his razor it LOOSENED HIS “HIDE” and LIFTED HIM OUT OF THE CHAIR."
"毫无疑问，这是夸张。在佛罗伦萨他对乞丐的骚扰很恼火，所以他假装自己处于一种想要报复的发疯状态，逮住并吃掉了一个乞丐。当然，这不是真的。他详细地介绍了一部十七或十八世纪前的戏剧剧本，并声称是在古罗马斗兽场的尘土、模具和垃圾中发现它的。有一句对以上这种说法的很有力的评论：即使是铁铸的剧本也不可能在那种环境中幸存这么久。在希腊，有一次他明显表现出恐惧，并想要逃跑，但他却厚颜无耻地将逃跑平淡地掩饰为：“我们向比雷埃夫斯港缓缓而行。”“缓缓而行”，一点没错！他毫不犹豫地透露在以弗所时，当他的骡子偏离了正确的方向时，他从骡子上下来，把它夹在胳膊下面，重新带回公路，指给它正确的方向，再骑上去，心满意足地睡去，直到再次需要将骡子带回正确的方向时才醒来。他说与他同船的乘客中有个正长身体的年轻人，经常习惯在正餐之间吃肥皂和麻絮充饥。他提到：在巴勒斯坦，蚂蚁会自带食物，爬行十一英里到沙漠过夏天。然而从他对这个国家的描述可知，这种事情是不可能发生的。他说道，并且说得好像是最平常的事一样，在耶路撒冷，光天化日之下，他在大路上用戈弗雷·德布永的剑把一个穆斯林教徒剁成了两半。如果那穆斯林教徒想要死在自己的墓地里，他就会流更多的血。这些叙述丝毫不值得令人注意。吐温先生或是其他任何一个外国人如果在耶路撒冷做出这种事，一定会遭到围攻，并因此而丧命。但为什么不停下来？为什么还喋喋不休地说出更多厚颜无耻令人恼火的谎话呢？我们看看这段话：他申明“在君士坦丁堡的圣·索菲亚清真寺，我的双脚陷入了混有树胶、泥浆和其他脏东西的泥沼里。那晚我用坏了两千多双脱靴器才把靴子脱了下来。那时，有些基督教徒甚至会私自将脱落的部分带走。”真是骇人听闻啊。这样的话肯定是谎话——再无其他可能。权威人士告诉我们《傻瓜国外旅行记》这本充斥着过多的谎言，并且是数不清的弥天大谎的书籍，事实上却被采用为几个州的中学和大学教科书！当我们告诉读者这一切时，他们会对美国普遍存在的极端愚昧震惊许久吧？","This is unquestionably exaggerated.In Florence he was so annoyed by beggars that he pretends to have seized and eaten one in a frantic spirit of revenge.There is, of course, no truth in this.He gives at full length a theatrical program seventeen or eighteen hundred years old, which he professes to have found in the ruins of the Coliseum, among the dirt and mold and rubbish.It is a sufficient comment upon this statement to remark that even a cast-iron program would not have lasted so long under such circumstances.In Greece he plainly betrays both fright and flight upon one occasion, but with frozen effrontery puts the latter in this falsely tamed form: “We SIDLED toward the Piraeus.”“Sidled,” indeed!He does not hesitate to intimate that at Ephesus, when his mule strayed from the proper course, he got down, took him under his arm, carried him to the road again, pointed him right, remounted, and went to sleep contentedly till it was time to restore the beast to the path once more.He states that a growing youth among his ship’s passengers was in the constant habit of appeasing his hunger with soap and oakum between meals.In Palestine he tells of ants that came eleven miles to spend the summer in the desert and brought their provisions with them; yet he shows by his description of the country that the feat was an impossibility.He mentions, as if it were the most commonplace of matters, that he cut a Moslem in two in broad daylight in Jerusalem, with Godfrey de Bouillon’s sword, and would have shed more blood IF HE HAD HAD A GRAVEYARD OF HIS OWN.These statements are unworthy a moment’s attention.Mr. Twain or any other foreigner who did such a thing in Jerusalem would be mobbed, and would infallibly lose his life.But why go on?Why repeat more of his audacious and exasperating falsehoods?Let us close fittingly with this one: he affirms that “in the mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople I got my feet so stuck up with a complication of gums, slime, and general impurity, that I wore out more than two thousand pair of bootjacks getting my boots off that night, and even then some Christian hide peeled off with them.”It is monstrous.Such statements are simply lies—there is no other name for them.Will the reader longer marvel at the brutal ignorance that pervades the American nation when we tell him that we are informed upon perfectly good authority that this extravagant compilation of falsehoods, this exhaustless mine of stupendous lies, this INNOCENTS ABROAD, has actually been adopted by the schools and colleges of several of the states as a text-book!"
"但是，如果说他的谎言令人恼火的话，那么他的愚昧无知就足以让读者烧掉他的作品，鄙视那个作者。在某个地方，他惊骇地看到月光下有一个被谋杀的人。他吓得跳出窗户，跨过窗框和所有的障碍，然后如孩子般天真地说自己“不害怕，只是非常焦虑”。耗光耐心，我们不得不指出这个傻瓜根本没意识到卢克丽霞·博尔吉亚已经永远离开舞台！他不懂任何外语，却毫不避讳地批评意大利人讲话的方式。他说他们这样拼写伟大的画家之名“Vinci，但却读成Vinchy”——然后天真地补充道，“外国人的拼写比发音好。”结果只能表明他无可救药的无知。在另外一个地方，他极度荒唐可笑地让意大利人说“tare an ouns”这个短语。在罗马，他坚定地相信圣菲利普·尼里的心里由于充满神圣的爱，以致胀裂肋骨的传说——他这样坚定地相信是因为有位拥有一连串大学学位的作者支持这个传说——“否则的话，”这位优雅的傻瓜说，“我应该会很好奇菲利普晚饭到底吃了什么才能把肋骨撑破。”我们的作家长途跋涉，旅途劳顿地跑到意大利的狗洞地区，要在狗身上做毒性实验——他精心做了实验准备，最后却发现自己没有实验用的狗。明智的人会对此事守口如瓶，但若是无知的人，一切都会流传天下。他在被发掘出的两千年前庞贝古城的一个车辙里扭伤了脚。然后，他注视着相邻广场中一具焦炭般的尸体，想象这可能是古代街道长官的遗体，他的恐惧马上就转化为对现状的快活满足。在大马士革，他在参观了三千年历史的亚拿尼亚水井后，像孩子一样既惊讶又兴奋。因为他发现水井的水“纯净新鲜得好像这水井是昨天才挖好的一样。”在圣地，他沮丧地面对拗口的阿拉伯人和希伯来人的名字不知该怎么念，最后决定叫他们为威廉斯堡，鲍德温城等等，他解释说“为了拼写的方便。”","But if his falsehoods are distressing, his innocence and his ignorance are enough to make one burn the book and despise the author.In one place he was so appalled at the sudden spectacle of a murdered man, unveiled by the moonlight, that he jumped out of the window, going through sash and all, and then remarks with the most childlike simplicity that he “was not scared, but was considerably agitated.”It puts us out of patience to note that the simpleton is densely unconscious that Lucretia Borgia ever existed off the stage.He is vulgarly ignorant of all foreign languages, but is frank enough to criticize, the Italians’ use of their own tongue.He says they spell the name of their great painter “Vinci, but pronounce it Vinchy”— and then adds with a naivet’e possible only to helpless ignorance, “foreigners always spell better than they pronounce.”In another place he commits the bald absurdity of putting the phrase “tare an ouns” into an Italian’s mouth.In Rome he unhesitatingly believes the legend that St. Philip Neri’s heart was so inflamed with divine love that it burst his ribs—believes it wholly because an author with a learned list of university degrees strung after his name endorses it—“otherwise,” says this gentle idiot, “I should have felt a curiosity to know what Philip had for dinner.”Our author makes a long, fatiguing journey to the Grotto del Cane on purpose to test its poisoning powers on a dog—got elaborately ready for the experiment, and then discovered that he had no dog.A wiser person would have kept such a thing discreetly to himself, but with this harmless creature everything comes out.He hurts his foot in a rut two thousand years old in exhumed Pompeii, and presently, when staring at one of the cinder-like corpses unearthed in the next square, conceives the idea that maybe it is the remains of the ancient Street Commissioner, and straightway his horror softens down to a sort of chirpy contentment with the condition of things.In Damascus he visits the well of Ananias, three thousand years old, and is as surprised and delighted as a child to find that the water is “as pure and fresh as if the well had been dug yesterday.”In the Holy Land he gags desperately at the hard Arabic and Hebrew Biblical names, and finally concludes to call them Baldwinsville, Williamsburgh, and so on, “for convenience of spelling.”"
"因此，我们可以坦率地谈论此人令人瞠目结舌的朴素天真，但无法同样坦率地谈论他的愚昧无知。我们不知道从何谈起。即使我们知道从何谈起，也不知道什么时候才能说完。我们仅举一个例子，一个就好。直到他到达罗马，他才知道米开朗基罗已经去世。然后，他并没有悄悄离开以掩饰自己丢脸的愚蠢，却进而由衷地感慨：他去世了，终于摆脱了所有的麻烦！","We have thus spoken freely of this man’s stupefying simplicity and innocence, but we cannot deal similarly with his colossal ignorance.We do not know where to begin.And if we knew where to begin, we certainly would not know where to leave off.We will give one specimen, and one only.He did not know, until he got to Rome, that Michael Angelo was dead!And then, instead of crawling away and hiding his shameful ignorance somewhere, he proceeds to express a pious, grateful sort of satisfaction that he is gone and out of his troubles!"
"不，读者可以自己找出作者出尽洋相的地方。这本书绝对是危险的。因为里面有大量各种各样的错误陈述，而做出陈述的人却言之凿凿。然而它却是美国学校里的教科书。","No, the reader may seek out the author’s exhibition of his uncultivation for himself.The book is absolutely dangerous, considering the magnitude and variety of its misstatements, and the convincing confidence with which they are made.And yet it is a text-book in the schools of America."
"这个身处古代大师们伟大杰作中的可怜的糊涂虫，试图掌握高超的艺术知识。他认为对于一个旅行者来说自己摸索理解出的艺术知识是值得炫耀的。但他用什么方法学习呢？他获得了什么心得呢？对意大利的名画有多少了解，又能欣赏到何种程度呢？请阅读以下部分：","The poor blunderer mouses among the sublime creations of the Old Masters, trying to acquire the elegant proficiency in art-knowledge, which he has a groping sort of comprehension is a proper thing for a traveled man to be able to display.But what is the manner of his study?And what is the progress he achieves?To what extent does he familiarize himself with the great pictures of Italy, and what degree of appreciation does he arrive at?Read:"
"“当看见一位修道士与一头狮子为伴，并仰望天空时，我们就知道那是圣·马克。当看见一位修道士拿着一本书和一支笔，平静地仰望天空，用心思考，我们就知道那是圣·马修。当看见一位修道士坐在岩石上，平静地仰望着天空，身旁除了一个人类的头骨，再无其他的行李，我们就知道那是圣·杰尔姆。因为我们知道他总是轻装出行。当看见其他的修道士平静地仰望天空，但没有什么特征时，我们总是想知道他们是谁。这样做是因为我们想要谦逊地学习。”","“When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking up into heaven, we know that that is St. Mark.When we see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew.When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome.Because we know that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage.When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are.We do this because we humbly wish to learn.”"
"然后他列出他看过的那几幅画的众多复本，一惯天真地补充说自己受到了鼓舞，认为如果自己能再多看一些复本，再有更广泛一些经历，最终“一定会对这些作品产生兴趣的”——真是个庸俗的粗人。","He then enumerates the thousands and thousands of copies of these several pictures which he has seen, and adds with accustomed simplicity that he feels encouraged to believe that when he has seen “Some More” of each, and had a larger experience, he will eventually “begin to take an absorbing interest in them”—the vulgar boor."
"我们展示这些是为了说明这是一本奇特的书，相信没有人会否认这一点。相信我们也已经表明，这本书在天真无知的人手里，就是一本有害的书。这本书是一个有病态思想的人蓄意写出的谎话连篇的作品，这一点在书中的每一页都有所体现。以上这些评论都将被如实地记录下来。最后，我们还是应该宽容一些地表示即使是这样的书，也是有一些可取之处的。可见每当作者说起自己的国家而不谈欧洲时，他从来都妙语连珠，不仅风趣，还令读者得到启发。每位读者都能从书中部分的章节段落中受益：有关在加利福尼亚和内华达的金银矿区的生活，有关在美国西部平原和沙漠地区生活的印第安人和他们嗜食人肉的恶习，有关在两三匙海鸟粪的帮助下就能在火药桶里培育蔬菜的方法，有关夜间在手推车贩卖的四处避税的小型武器，有关亨博尔特矿区的母牛和骡子，晚上它们竟顺着烟囱爬下来打扰人类的奇事。这些事情不只新奇，而且非常值得了解。可惜作者没有记述更多类似的事情。这本书写得很好，很有趣，而且刚好不贵。","That we have shown this to be a remarkable book, we think no one will deny.That is a pernicious book to place in the hands of the confiding and uniformed, we think we have also shown.That the book is a deliberate and wicked creation of a diseased mind, is apparent upon every page.Having placed our judgment thus upon record, let us close with what charity we can, by remarking that even in this volume there is some good to be found; for whenever the author talks of his own country and lets Europe alone, he never fails to make himself interesting, and not only interesting but instructive.No one can read without benefit his occasional chapters and paragraphs, about life in the gold and silver mines of California and Nevada; about the Indians of the plains and deserts of the West, and their cannibalism; about the raising of vegetables in kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three teaspoons of guano; about the moving of small arms from place to place at night in wheelbarrows to avoid taxes; and about a sort of cows and mules in the Humboldt mines, that climb down chimneys and disturb the people at night.These matters are not only new, but are well worth knowing.It is a pity the author did not put in more of the same kind.His book is well written and is exceedingly entertaining, and so it just barely escaped being quite valuable also."
"（一个月之后）","(One month later)"
"最近我收到几封信，看到许多报纸上的文章。它们都是关于一个话题的，意思也大致相同。在这里我列出几段原文给大家看看。一段是来自纽约的一家报纸，一段是来自一位老友的来信，还有一段选自我并不认识的纽约出版商的来信。我努力谦恭地尽量使这些零碎的意见更中听些。但我要声明的是他们赞扬的那篇文章（刊登在十二月的《银河》，在伦敦《星期六评论》中发表的对《傻瓜国外旅行记》的批评）是我自己写的，每一行都是。","Latterly I have received several letters, and see a number of newspaper paragraphs, all upon a certain subject, and all of about the same tenor.I here give honest specimens.One is from a New York paper, one is from a letter from an old friend, and one is from a letter from a New York publisher who is a stranger to me.I humbly endeavor to make these bits toothsome with the remark that the article they are praising (which appeared in the December GALAXY, and PRETENDED to be a criticism from the London SATURDAY REVIEW on my INNOCENTS ABROAD) WAS WRITTEN BY MYSELF, EVERY LINE OF IT:"
"《先驱报》说伦敦《星期六评论》对马克·吐温《傻瓜国外旅行记》的“严肃批评”再精彩不过。读这本书之前我们猜想它会像人们说的那样，是本很“严肃的”书，我们甚至准备好可能会感动到流泪。但仔细读过之后，必须承认这是在马克·吐温继《跳蛙》之后的这段时间内，我们读到的最具幽默讽刺性的作品。","The HERALD says the richest thing out is the “serious critique” in the London SATURDAY REVIEW, on Mark Twain’s INNOCENTS ABROAD.We thought before we read it that it must be “serious,” as everybody said so, and were even ready to shed a few tears; but since perusing it, we are bound to confess that next to Mark Twain’s “Jumping Frog” it’s the finest bit of humor and sarcasm that we’ve come across in many a day."
"（我并非每天都能得到那样的称赞。）","(I do not get a compliment like that every day.)"
"过去我认为你的作品都非常好看，但看过《银河》转载伦敦《星期六评论》中对你新书的批评之后，我才发现自己以前有多傻。若你征求我的建议，那我的建议就是，只要你不怕你的幽默比不上那篇批评的话，就把那篇文章作为特别的一章加进下一版的《傻瓜国外旅行记》里。那是我读过的最精彩的文章了。","I used to think that your writings were pretty good, but after reading the criticism in THE GALAXY from the LONDON REVIEW, have discovered what an ass I must have been.If suggestions are in order, mine is, that you put that article in your next edition of the INNOCENTS, as an extra chapter, if you are not afraid to put your own humor in competition with it.It is as rich a thing as I ever read."
"（这是一位图书出版商的大力推荐之词。）","(Which is strong commendation from a book publisher.)"
"我的朋友，伦敦《星期六评论》的书评作家，他不是表面上表现的那样愚蠢或“严肃”的人，正相反，他非常喜欢及欣赏你的书。当我读到《银河》上的那篇文章时，我可以想象得到他由衷地放声大笑的样子。但是他为天主教和英国国教的教徒写作。他高调、陈旧、保守有礼，而当他假装严肃地摇头时，却从让你感到震惊中而获得乐趣。他自己就是一个非常棒的幽默大师。","The London Reviewer, my friend, is not the stupid, “serious” creature he pretends to be, I think; but, on the contrary, has a keep appreciation and enjoyment of your book.As I read his article in THE GALAXY, I could imagine him giving vent to many a hearty laugh.But he is writing for Catholics and Established Church people, and high-toned, antiquated, conservative gentility, whom it is a delight to him to help you shock, while he pretends to shake his head with owlish density.He is a magnificent humorist himself."
"（既然我举止高雅，长相俊美，那么我会脱帽，双脚并立，手放心口向我永远的朋友和伙伴致敬，并用阿拉巴马的方言告诉他：“我不胜荣幸。”）","(Now that is graceful and handsome.I take off my hat to my life-long friend and comrade, and with my feet together and my fingers spread over my heart, I say, in the language of Alabama, “You do me proud.”)"
"身为这篇文章的作者，我感到惭愧，但我并无冒犯之意。在波士顿《广告人》中的一则新闻里，我获悉对我英文版作品的正式的严肃的批评刊登在《星期六邮报》上。冷漠沉闷的英国佬用羽毛笔写的文学早餐，对于天生道德感薄弱的人来说难以接受。于是我回家，模仿它的讽刺腔调，可以说我陶醉于这种模仿之中。在我的模仿评论写成并寄给印刷厂之后，我才亲眼看到《星期六邮报》上的那篇文章。当我拿到那篇评论时，我觉得它粗俗，文笔拙劣，歪曲事实，通篇生硬死板。之前引用的报纸上那段话的作者并未受到评论特点的误导。","I stand guilty of the authorship of the article, but I did not mean any harm.I saw by an item in the Boston ADVERTISER that a solemn, serious critique on the English edition of my book had appeared in the London SATURDAY REVIEW, and the idea of SUCH a literary breakfast by a stolid, ponderous British ogre of the quill was too much for a naturally weak virtue, and I went home and burlesqued it— reveled in it, I may say.I never saw a copy of the real SATURDAY REVIEW criticism until after my burlesque was written and mailed to the printer.But when I did get hold of a copy, I found it to be vulgar, awkwardly written, ill-natured, and entirely serious and in earnest.The gentleman who wrote the newspaper paragraph above quoted had not been misled as to its character."
"如果现在有人怀疑我的话，我会杀了他。不，我不会杀他，我会赢走他的钱。我要跟他以二十比一的赌率打赌，让任何一位纽约出版人下注，就赌关于上面文章的著作权，我的说法是完全真实的。或许我会因此而发财，我愿意参加有关于此问题的所有赌局，假如有人想要更大的投注率，我也会完全同意。但是，他应该查明我是否在赌一件“有把握”的事情，或在拿出钱冒险之前，他可以去公共图书馆查阅一下十月八日的伦敦《星期六评论》，那里面有真正的书评。","If any man doubts my word now, I will kill him.No, I will not kill him; I will win his money.I will bet him twenty to one, and let any New York publisher hold the stakes, that the statements I have above made as to the authorship of the article in question are entirely true.Perhaps I may get wealthy at this, for I am willing to take all the bets that offer; and if a man wants larger odds, I will give him all he requires.But he ought to find out whether I am betting on what is termed “a sure thing” or not before he ventures his money, and he can do that by going to a public library and examining the London SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th, which contains the real critique."
"天哪！有人以为我才是“被出卖”的人！","Bless me, some people thought that I was the “sold” person!"
"注：我无法抑制对如此有趣的事情发表评论的欲望——这篇简单、得体、富有哲理、体现着作者乐观与自信的评论，摘自《辛辛那提问询报》。","P.S.—I cannot resist the temptation to toss in this most savory thing of all—this easy, graceful, philosophical disquisition, with his happy, chirping confidence.It is from the Cincinnati ENQUIRER:"
"没有什么比一支好雪茄的价值更难以确定的了。如果不知道帕特加雪茄的价格，十分之九的吸烟者会更喜欢普通的国产雪茄，而不是五十五美分的帕特加雪茄。帕特加雪茄的味道对于习惯了康涅狄格州烟叶口味的人来说太淡了。这也很幽默。品质越好，不受认可的危险性就越大。就连马克·吐温都被一篇关于他的作品《傻瓜国外旅行记》的英语评论否定了。马克·吐温绝不是粗俗的幽默家。但英国人的幽默比起他的来太委婉，以致他误把这种幽默当作死板和“过分乏味”。","Nothing is more uncertain than the value of a fine cigar.Nine smokers out of ten would prefer an ordinary domestic article, three for a quarter, to fifty-cent Partaga, if kept in ignorance of the cost of the latter.The flavor of the Partaga is too delicate for palates that have been accustomed to Connecticut seed leaf.So it is with humor.The finer it is in quality, the more danger of its not being recognized at all.Even Mark Twain has been taken in by an English review of his INNOCENTS ABROAD.Mark Twain is by no means a coarse humorist, but the Englishman’s humor is so much finer than his, that he mistakes it for solid earnest, and “lafts most consumedly.”"
"不学习的人只会困住自己。以后，当我写出一篇自己觉得不错的文章时，我有理由担心它的某些部分看起来并不像是美国人写的，我将断言它的作者是英国人，并且它抄袭于一家伦敦的期刊。我会在后排占个座位，享受那热烈的掌声。","A man who cannot learn stands in his own light.Hereafter, when I write an article which I know to be good, but which I may have reason to fear will not, in some quarters, be considered to amount to much, coming from an American, I will aver that an Englishman wrote it and that it is copied from a London journal.And then I will occupy a back seat and enjoy the cordial applause."
"（再后来）","(Still later)"
"马克·吐温最终知道了《星期六评论》上对《傻瓜国外旅行记》的批评不是认真的。他非常懊悔自己曾经有过被恶意出卖的想法。他只得用最后的办法，在上期《银河》上声明是他自己写的那篇评论，然后发表在《银河》上卖给大众。这很有创意，但不幸的是这不是真的。如果有读者不嫌麻烦来办公室询问，我们会给他们看刊登在十月八号《星期六评论》上的原文。比较之下，他们会发现此评论跟《银河》上的那篇一模一样。对于马克来说，最好的做法就是承认他被出卖，并且不再提及此事。","Mark Twain at last sees that the SATURDAY REVIEW’S criticism of his INNOCENTS ABROAD was not serious, and he is intensely mortified at the thought of having been so badly sold.He takes the only course left him, and in the last GALAXY claims that HE wrote the criticism himself, and published it in THE GALAXY to sell the public.This is ingenious, but unfortunately it is not true.If any of our readers will take the trouble to call at this office we sill show them the original article in the SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th, which, on comparison, will be found to be identical with the one published in THE GALAXY.The best thing for Mark to do will be to admit that he was sold, and say no more about it."
"以上摘自《辛辛那提问询报》，且都不是真的。来看看证据。如果《辛辛那提问询报》的人，能通过任一中介在《银河》办公室里弄到十月八号伦敦《星期六评论》上的那篇书评，比较后与《银河》上的评论一模一样的话，我愿付给那家中介五百美元。此外，在任意指定时间，要是我在同一个地方无法写出十月八号伦敦《星期六评论》中的文章，包括《傻瓜国外旅行记》的长篇书论，并且任一段任一行与我在《银河》上发表的文章完全不同的话，我愿再付给《辛辛那提问询报》五百美元。位于纽约百老汇大街500号的谢尔登出版公司是我的“支持者”。有《辛辛那提问询报》授权的纽约的任何一个人都会立即收到此消息。对于《辛辛那提问询报》的人来说，证明他们在上述言论中没有可耻地故意说谎，就可以轻松挣到钱。他们会尴尬地承认这些谎话，还是会派个代理人去《银河》办公室呢？我想《辛辛那提问询报》的编辑们一定是群小孩子。","The above is from the Cincinnati ENQUIRER, and is a falsehood.Come to the proof.If the ENQUIRER people, through any agent, will produce at THE GALAXY office a London SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th, containing an “article which, on comparison, will be found to be identical with the one published in THE GALAXY, I will pay to that agent five hundred dollars cash.Moreover, if at any specified time I fail to produce at the same place a copy of the London SATURDAY REVIEW of October 8th, containing a lengthy criticism upon the INNOCENTS ABROAD, entirely different, in every paragraph and sentence, from the one I published in THE GALAXY, I will pay to the ENQUIRER agent another five hundred dollars cash.I offer Sheldon & Co., publishers, 500 Broadway, New York, as my “backers.”Any one in New York, authorized by the ENQUIRER, will receive prompt attention.It is an easy and profitable way for the ENQUIRER people to prove that they have not uttered a pitiful, deliberate falsehood in the above paragraphs.Will they swallow that falsehood ignominiously, or will they send an agent to THE GALAXY office.I think the Cincinnati ENQUIRER must be edited by children."
