"作者：埃德加·艾伦·坡《快报》，诺福克惊人消息！三天飞越大西洋！这标志蒙克·梅森先生的飞行器获巨大成功！梅森先生、罗伯特·霍兰先生、亨森先生、哈里森·安斯沃思先生与另外四人乘坐操舵气球“维多利亚号”，经过75小时的越洋飞行，降落在南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿港附近的沙利文岛！请看这次航行的全部细节！","by Edgar Allan PoeASTOUNDING NEWS BY EXPRESS, VIA NORFOLK!—The Atlantic Crossed in Three Days!—Signal Triumph of Mr. Monck Mason’s Flying Machine!—Arrival at Sullivan’s Island, near Charleston, S. C., of Mr. Mason, Mr. Robert Holland, Mr. Henson, Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, and four others, in the Steering Balloon, Victoria, after a Passage of Seventy-five Hours from Land to Land!Full Particulars of the Voyage!"
"这篇冠以显眼的大标题和充满了溢美之辞的妙文，实际上最初发表于日报《纽约太阳报》上，在两份查尔斯顿邮件送达的几小时间隔里，该日报充分达到了为那些爱打听小道消息的人们制造难以消化的食物的目的。人们纷纷抢购这份“具有新闻独家报道的报纸”，景象甚至超过了惊人的消息本身。事实上，如果（正如某些人断言）“维多利亚号”根本没有完成所报道的航行，要为它找到一个没完成航行的理由还颇为困难。等气压这一重要问题终于被解决！","The subjoined jeu d’esprit with the preceding heading in magnificent capitals, well interspersed with notes of admiration, was originally published, as matter of fact, in the@New York Sun@, a daily newspaper, and therein fully subserved the purpose of creating indigestible aliment for the quidnuncs during the few hours intervening between a couple of the Charleston mails.The rush for the “sole paper which had the news” was something beyond even the prodigious; and, in fact, if (as some assert) the Victoria did not absolutely accomplish the voyage recorded it will be difficult to assign a reason why she should not have accomplished it.E. A. P. THE GREAT problem is at length solved!"
"天空就像陆地和海洋一样，也被科学所征服，而且将成为一种人类所常用的便捷路线。人类竟然已经乘坐气球飞越了大西洋！而且这次飞越轻而易举——没有任何明显的、重大的危险——机器一直在控制之下——而且从大洋的此岸到彼岸只用了短得难以置信的75小时！","The air, as well as the earth and the ocean, has been subdued by science, and will become a common and convenient highway for mankind.The Atlantic has been actually crossed in a Balloon! and this too without difficulty—without any great apparent danger—with thorough control of the machine—and in the inconceivably brief period of seventy-five hours from shore to shore!"
"凭着我们在南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿港的一位代理人的努力，我们得以首先向公众提供这次非凡航行的详细报道。这次航行始于本月6日星期六上午11时，终于本月9日星期二下午2时。参加者有埃弗拉德·布林赫斯特爵士、本廷克勋爵的侄子奥斯本先生、著名的气球驾驶员蒙克·梅森先生和罗伯特·霍兰先生、《杰克·谢泼德》一书的作者哈里森·安斯沃思先生等人和最近失败的飞行器策划者亨森先生——以及来自伍利奇的两位海员——一共八人。下文提供的细节描述从各方面来看可算是真实准确的，除了个别的小例外，这些描述均逐字抄自蒙克·梅森先生和哈里森·安斯沃思先生合写的航行日记。我们的代理人对这两位先生心怀感激，他们向他礼貌地口述了很多关于气球本身的情况，包括气球构造和其他有趣的事情。我们对收到的手稿所做的仅有的改动是为了把我们的代理人福赛思先生匆匆写就的报道加工成通顺易懂的文章。","By the energy of an agent at Charleston, S. C., we are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage, which was performed between Saturday, the 6th instant, at 11 A.M. and 2 P.M., on Tuesday, the 9th instant, by Sir Everard Bringhurst; Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck’s; Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known aeronauts; Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, author of @Jack Sheppard@,etc.; and Mr. Henson the projector of the late unsuccessful flying machine—with two seamen from Woolwich—in all, eight persons.The particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect, as, with a slight exception, they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself, its construction, and other matters of interest.The only alteration in the MS. received, has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a connected and intelligible form."
"气球","The Balloon"
"最近两次明显的失败——亨森先生和乔治·凯利爵士的失败——大大降低了公众对空中航行这一话题的兴趣。亨森先生的方案（一开始连科学家们都认为是切实可行的）是建立在斜面原理的基础上，飞行器在高处受外力而运动，并由空气冲击叶片的旋转转动来维持动力，这些叶片的形状和数量都与风车的轮片相像。但是，人们在阿德莱德展览会场进行的几次模型试验中发现，这些扇叶的转动非但没有推动机器运转，实际上反而阻碍了它的飞行。机器所显示出的唯一推动力仅仅是从斜面降落所获得的，这一推动力使得飞行器在叶片静止时比叶片运转时飞得更远——这一事实充分证明这些叶片毫无用处。倘若失去了同时也是支撑力的推动力，整个装置必将坠落。正是这种考虑使得乔治·凯利爵士想只把一个推动装置运用于某种本身就具有独立承载力的机器——简言之，把推动器用于一只气球。不过，只有乔治先生考虑将这种设想付诸实践时，才可以说这种想法是新颖独特、别出心裁的。他在理工学院展示了他这项发明的一个模型。在该模型里，推动原理，又称推动力，还被应用于使分隔的翼面或者说叶片旋转。共有四枚叶片，但人们发现它们完全无助于推动气球，也无助于增加气球的上升力。因此整个设计彻底失败。","Two very decided failures, of late,—those of Mr. Henson and Sir George Cayley,—had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation.Mr. Henson’s scheme (which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill.But, in all the experiments made with models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight.The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane, and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they were in motion—a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility, and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the sustaining power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend.This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support—in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice.He exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution.The propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution.These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power.The whole project was thus a complete failure."
"正是在这个时候，蒙克·梅森先生（他于1837年驾驶“纳索号”气球从多佛飞抵韦尔堡，轰动一时）想到了用阿基米德螺旋原理从空气中获取推动力——他恰当地将亨森先生和乔治·凯利先生的失败归因于他们将翼面分隔成单独的叶片。他的第一次公开实验在威利斯实验室进行，但后来他把模型搬到了阿德莱德展览会场。","It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover to Weilburg in the balloon Nassau occasioned so much excitement in 1837) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the air—rightly attributing the failure of Mr. Henson’s scheme, and of Sir George Cayley’s to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes.He made the first public experiment at Willis’s Rooms, but afterward removed his model to the Adelaide Gallery."
"像乔治·凯利爵士的气球一样，他的气球也是椭圆形的。气球长为13英尺6英寸——高为6英尺8英寸。气球可容纳320立方英尺的气体，如果气体是纯氢气，在气球刚刚充满气，气体还没发生化学反应或泄漏的时候，它能够承载21英磅的重量。整个机器装置重达17英磅——还余下4英磅的承载能力。气球的正下方是一个约9英尺长的轻木框架，框架以常用的方式采用绳网安装在气球上。框架上悬挂着一个柳条筐，或称吊舱。","Like Sir George Cayley’s balloon, his own was an ellipsoid.Its length was 13 feet 6 inches—height, 6 feet 8 inches.It contained about 320 cubic feet of gas, which, if pure hydrogen, would support 21 pounds upon its first inflation, before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape.The weight of the whole machine and apparatus was 17 pounds—leaving about 4 pounds to spare.Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light wood, about 9 feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with a net-work in the customary manner.From this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car."
"螺旋装置的中轴是由一根长为18英寸的空心黄铜管做成的，轴心穿过一组倾斜15度的半螺旋形的钢丝辐条，长为2英尺，中轴两边各伸出1英尺。这些辐条的外端用两根扁平的金属线相互连接。螺旋装置的整体框架就是通过这种方式构成的。螺旋装置上面盖着一块被裁成三角形的浸油绸布，将绸布绷紧，这使得表面差不多光滑均匀。螺旋装置的中轴两端均由从环箍上伸下来的空心黄铜管支撑。这些黄铜管的下端有些孔眼，轴枢就在这些孔眼中旋转。从中轴靠近吊舱的一端伸出一根钢制长杆，长杆把螺旋装置和固定在吊舱上的一个弹簧装置的小齿轮连在一起。通过操纵这个弹簧装置，螺旋装置就会以极快的速度旋转起来，并以此带动整个飞行器向前运动。通过对方向舵的操作，机器可以自如地转换任何方向。相比其尺寸，弹簧装置的动力是巨大的。拧一圈直径4英尺的弹簧就能产生45磅的拉力，并且拉力会随着弹簧的收紧越来越大。弹簧装置一共重8磅6盎司。方向舵是一个蒙着绸布的轻巧的藤条架，形状有点像板羽球的球板，长约3英尺，最宽处1英尺。方向舵重约2盎司。它可以平置，可以上下左右任意转动调整，这使得气球驾驶员能够把飞行中保持倾斜位置时必然产生的的阻力转移到他所希望的任何一边，这样就能在相反的方向操纵气球。","The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, 18 inches in length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at 15 degrees, pass a series of steel-wire radii, 2 feet long, and thus projecting a foot on either side.These radii are connected at the outer extremities by 2 bands of flattened wire; the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface.At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop.In the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve.From the end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car.By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole.By means of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction.The spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of raising 45 pounds upon a barrel of 4 inches diameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound up.It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces.The rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a battledoor, and was about 3 feet long, and at the widest, one foot.Its weight was about 2 ounces.It could be turned flat, and directed upward or downward, as well as to the right or left, and thus enabled the aeronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he might desire to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction."
"这个模型（由于时间有限，我们只能用这种不尽完善的方式来描述）在阿德莱德展览会场投入飞行，达到了时速5英里。尽管如此，但是说来奇怪，与之前亨森先生的那个结构复杂的机器相比，这个模型没有引起公众多大兴趣——这个世界对任何貌似简单的东西是如此断然地轻视。人们普遍认为，要实现迫切需要的空中航行，必须根据某种异常深奥的动力学原理制造出某种极其复杂的装置。","This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery, where it accomplished a velocity of 5 miles per hour; although, strange to say, it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of Mr. Henson—so resolute is the world to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity.To accomplish the great desideratum of aerial navigation, it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in dynamics."
"然而，梅森先生坚信他的发明将获得最后的成功，他做出这个决定：只要可能，就立刻着手制造一个容量够大的气球，用一次距离较长的飞行来验证这个问题。最初的计划是像以前的“纳索号”气球一样飞越英吉利海峡。为了实现他的想法，他请求埃弗拉德·布林赫斯特爵士和奥斯本先生帮忙，并获得了资助。这两位先生均以科学知识渊博而闻名，尤其因对改进气球驾驶法感兴趣而出名。应奥斯本先生的请求，这项计划对公众严格保密——唯一了解这个设计的人是那些实际参加机器制造的人。飞行器是在（在梅森先生、霍兰先生、埃弗拉德·布林赫斯特爵士和奥斯本先生的监督之下）威尔士彭斯特拉索尔附近奥斯本先生的别墅里制造的。亨森先生在他的朋友安斯沃思先生的陪同下，于上周六被允许能亲眼目睹了气球。彼时这两位先生最终商定参加这次冒险航行。没人告诉我们为何那两位海员也被包括在内——但一两天内，我们将让读者了解到有关这次非凡航行的所有细节。","So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate success of his invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible, a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extent; the original design being to cross the British Channel, as before, in the Nassau balloon.To carry out his views, he solicited and obtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of aerostation.The project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the public—the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine, which was built (under the superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne) at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in Wales.Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted to a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last; when the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure.We are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party—but in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage."
"气球用绸布制成，上面涂了液体弹性橡胶。它体积巨大，可容纳的气体超过40000立方英尺。但由于用煤气取代了价格昂贵且不便掌握的氢气，气球的承载能力在完全充气后不超过2500磅。煤气不仅价格更加便宜，而且更容易获得和控制。","The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc.It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when fully inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about 2500 pounds.The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily procured and managed."
"我们应该感谢查尔斯·格林先生将煤气引进并广泛用于气球驾驶法。在他的发现之前，充气的过程不仅极为昂贵，而且不稳定。人们花费两三天来制造足够充满一只气球氢气的努力经常归于徒劳，由于氢元素十分活泼，并与周围的空气有亲和力，氢气极易从气球里漏出。一只性能良好的气球能把球内煤气的质量和数量保持六个月不变，却不能将等量的氢气纯度保持六个星期。","For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we are indebted to Mr. Charles Green.Up to his discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain.Two and even three days have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere.In a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coal gas unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks."
"气球的承载能力大约是2500磅，而航行人员的体重总和只有1200磅，在剩下的1300磅中，有1200磅由压舱物占据，都是一些大小不等的沙袋，上面标明各自的重量——还有绳索、气压表、望远镜、装有两周干粮的木桶、水桶、斗篷、毛毡旅行袋和其他各种必需品，这包括一个能用熟石灰热咖啡的咖啡壶，它能完全避免在气球上用火，这种做法是很谨慎的。除了压舱物和几件零碎物品，所有这些东西都挂在头顶的环箍上。与模型上的吊舱相比，这个吊舱在比例上要小巧、轻便得多。它由质地轻柔的柳条制成，这对于看似那么脆弱的机器来说，它显得格外牢固结实。吊舱大约4英尺深。方向舵在比例上也比模型上的舵大很多，而螺旋装置却小了很多。此外，气球上还备有一个铁锚和一根导绳。后者极为重要，不可或缺。在此有必要为那些不熟悉气球驾驶法细节的读者们作一番简要说明。","The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them—by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if it should be judged prudent to do so.All these articles, with the exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop overhead.The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one appended to the model.It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully strong for so frail looking a machine.Its rim is about 4 feet deep.The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller.The balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope, which latter is of the most indispensable importance.A few words, in explanation, will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation."
"气球一离开地面，便会受到许多可能改变其重量的情况的影响，会增加或减轻气球的上升力。例如，露水可能会凝结在绸布面上，重量甚至可达数百磅。这样就必须扔掉压舱物，否则机器会下降。压舱物扔掉以后，明媚的阳光使露水蒸发，同时使得气球里的气体膨胀，这时整个机器又会急速上升。要抑制这种上升，唯一的措施是（或者准确地说在格林先生发明导绳之前曾经是）打开阀门放气。但是气球放出气体也就相应地损失上升力。因此在相对较短的时间里，即使是结构最为完善的气球也必然会消耗掉其所有能源，降到地面上。这是远距离航行中的一个显著的障碍。","As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power.For example, there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even, of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the machine may descend.This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk, the whole will again rapidly ascend.To check this ascent, the only recourse is (or rather was, until Mr. Green’s invention of the guide-rope) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in the loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth.This was the great obstacle to voyages of length."
"导绳用人们所能想象得到的最简单的方式解决了这一难题。导绳只是一根从吊舱里悬下来的长绳，它的作用是防止气球的水平状态发生任何实质性的改变。比如，当绸布面上开始聚集水汽，并且机器因此开始下降时，就没必要扔掉压舱物以消除所增加的重量。因为可以通过按恰当比例把所需长度的导绳放回地面的方法来消除或抵消这种重量。另一方面，任何因素，如果造成气球重量过轻而随之上升，都可以立刻通过从地面收回导绳所增加的重量来抵消。因此，气球既不会上升也不会下降，除了在很小幅度内，并且其能源——无论是煤气还是压舱物，也相对地不受损失。当飞越大面积水域时，有必要使用一些铜制或木制的小桶，桶里面要装满密度比水小的液体压舱物。这些桶漂浮在水面上，起到了仅用导绳在地面上所起的全部作用。导绳的另一个极其重要的功能就是指明气球的方向。气球离地后，无论是在陆地还是在海上，导绳都拖拽在气球后面。不论如何行进，气球总是处于导绳前方。因此，通过指南针比较气球和导绳二者的相对位置，就始终能确定航线。同样，导绳和机器的垂直轴所构成的夹角可以指示出速度。当角度为零时——换句话说，当导绳悬垂着时，整个装置是静止的。而夹角越大，也就是说，气球在导绳末梢前方的距离越远，气球速度就越快，反之则越慢。","The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable.It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree.If, for example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon, the silk, and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary.If, on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth.Thus, the balloon can neither ascend nor descend, except within very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired.When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water.These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land.Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the direction of the balloon.The rope drags, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is made, a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two objects, will always indicate the course.In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates the velocity.When there is no angle—in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse."
"由于原计划是飞越英吉利海峡，在尽可能靠近巴黎的地方降落，所以航行者们已经预先准备好了出入欧洲大陆各国的护照，并像上次“纳索号”航行一样特别注明了本次航行的性质，使航行者们有权免除通常的正式手续。然而，一些意外事件却使这些护照变得多余。","As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent, specifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau voyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office; unexpected events, however, rendered these passports superfluous."
"本月六日星期六早晨，天刚破晓，充气工作在位于威尔士北部离彭斯特拉索尔约一英里的奥斯本先生的宅邸维尔沃尔别墅的庭院里悄然开始。十一点零七分，出发前一切准备就绪，气球升空，缓慢而平稳地朝着偏南的方向飘升。在最初的半小时里，没用到螺旋装置和方向舵。现在，我们将利用福赛思先生抄录的蒙克·梅森先生和安斯沃思先生合写的航行日记手稿继续报道。下面所引的日记正文出自梅森先生的手稿，每天的日记后面跟着一则附记，为安斯沃思先生所写。安斯沃思先生正在准备，并且不久将为公众提供有关这次航行的更加详尽的报道。该报道无疑会是一则扣人心弦的、趣味横生的航行报道。","The inflation was commenced very quietly at day-break, on Saturday morning, the 6th instant in the courtyard of Wheal-Vor House, Mr. Osborne’s seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7 minutes past 11, everything being ready for departure, the balloon was set free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no use being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the rudder.We proceed now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth from the joint MSS. of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Ainsworth.The body of the journal, as given, is in the handwriting of Mr. Mason, and a P. S. is appended, each day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in preparation, and will shortly give the public a more minute and, no doubt, a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage."
"日记","The Journal"
"4月6日，星期六——对于每一项可能带来麻烦的准备工作，我们都在前一夜完成了，今天拂晓时分，我们就开始充气。但是由于浓雾弥漫，妨碍了绸布面褶皱处的舒展，这使得充气工作很难控制，在将近十一点时我们才完成充气。接着，大家兴高采烈地割断缆绳，气球平稳地缓缓上升，借着微微的北风，我们朝布里斯托尔湾的方向飘去。我们发现上升的力量比预想的要大。我们越升越高，摆脱了悬崖，处于更强的太阳光之中，上升速度变得非常快。但是，我不希望航行刚刚开始就消耗煤气，所以决定随它现在这样继续上升。我们很快就收完了导绳。可是，即使在把导绳完全收离地面后，我们仍然急速上升。气球异常地平稳，看上去很漂亮。出发后大约10分钟，气压表显示出的高度为15000英尺。天气格外晴朗，下面的田园景色——无论从任何角度看都极为浪漫——此刻显得极为壮观。无数个幽深的峡谷由于盛满了浓雾，看上去就像是一个个湖泊，东南面那些重峦叠嶂的山峰峭壁，像极了东方传说里的古城巨堡。我们迅速地接近南面的山脉，而我们气球所处的高度足够让我们平安地飞越那些山峰。几分钟后，我们气派地翱翔于群山之上。安斯沃斯先生和两位海员吃惊地发现，从吊舱俯视，那些山脉貌似缺乏高度，气球迅速的上升趋势使下面的地面的起伏看上去接近平面。11点半，我们继续朝偏南方向航行，终于看到了布里斯托尔湾。15分钟后，海边浪花拍岸的轮廓立刻出现在我们身下，我们已经完全处于海面之上了。这时我们决定放掉足够量的煤气，以便使栓着浮桶的导绳浮在海面。这一决定立即被执行，然后我们开始逐渐下降。大约20分钟后，第一个浮桶触及海面，在第二个浮桶紧跟着触及海面后，我们就保持高度不变了。这时，我们都迫切地想试试方向舵和螺旋装置的功效，为使我们前进的方向更加偏东，与巴黎成一条直线，我们立刻将二者投入使用。借助于方向舵，我们的方向立刻得到了必要的调整，使得我们的航向与风向几乎成了直角。当启动螺旋装置上的弹簧时，我们欣喜地发现它正如所期盼的那样顺利地为我们提供推动力。为此我们由衷地欢呼了九声，并把一个装着一卷羊皮纸的漂流瓶扔进了大海，纸上简单叙述了这项发明的原理。然而，我们的欢呼尚未结束，一件意料之外的事情便发生了，这使得我们沮丧不已。连接弹簧和推动器的钢条突然从靠近吊舱的那端滑落出来，（因为我们带上的两个海员中的一个在吊舱里走动，引起吊舱晃动），钢条从螺旋装置的轴枢里掉出来，瞬间悬挂在了我们够不到的地方。当我们全神贯注地努力把它取回来时，从东面刮来一阵强风把我们卷入其中，让我们烦恼的是，这股风以急速增长的力量把我们吹向大西洋。我们很快发现气球正以每小时绝对不低于50或60英里的速度飘向大洋，以至于在我们固定好钢条，有时间来考虑该怎么办之前，便发现克利尔海角已经在我们北方约40英里处了。就在这时侯，安斯沃思先生提出了一个不同寻常，但在我看来绝对不是不切实际、异想天开的建议，而且这个建议立刻得到了霍兰先生的赞同，这个建议就是：我们应该利用这股烦人的强风，尝试着飞向北美海岸，以取代逆风飞往巴黎。经过片刻考虑，我欣然同意了这一大胆的提议，（说来奇怪）只有那两位海员表示反对。然而由于赞成的人占大多数，我们否定了他们的担忧，并且坚定不移地保持着我们的航向。我们朝正西航行。但是浮桶的拖拽实际上阻碍了我们的前进，并且无论是上升还是下降，气球已完全在我们的掌控之中，所以我们就先扔掉了50磅的压舱物，然后（用一个绞盘）收起一定长度的导绳，使其完全离开海面。这一措施的效果立刻显现出来，我们前进的速度大大增加了。随着风势，我们以几乎难以置信的速度飞行着。导绳飘曳在吊舱后面，就像是船上的长幡。不用说，转眼之间我们就看不到海岸了。我们从各式各样不尽其数的船只上飘过，少数船只正乘风破浪地前进着，但是大多数船只都是逆风不动的。我们让船只上的人们都兴奋不已——这也使我们乐在其中，尤其是那两个海员，此时，他们在少量杜松子酒的作用下，似乎决心让所顾虑或担心随风而去。许多船只鸣放了信号枪。所有人都高声欢呼（在我们听起来这些声音清晰得令人惊讶），并且挥动帽子和手帕向我们致意。整个白天我们始终以这样的方式航行，没有遇到重大事故，当夜色笼罩的时候，我们大致估算了一下航行的距离。航程绝对不会少于500英里，而且可能会更多。推动器一直在运转，这无疑为我们的行进提供了重大的帮助。随着夕阳西下，风力加强，疾风变成了一场真正的暴风，下面的海洋由于磷光现象清晰可见。东风刮了一整夜，显著地预示着我们的成功。我们遭受寒冷，潮湿的空气也使人极不舒服。幸好吊舱里有充足的地方让我们躺下，靠着斗篷和几条毯子，我们感觉还不错。","Saturday, April the 6th.—Every preparation likely to embarrass us having been made overnight, we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak; but owing to a thick fog which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before nearly eleven o’clock.Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction of the Bristol Channel.Found the ascending force greater than we had expected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and more in the sun’s rays, our ascent became very rapid.I did not wish, however, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so concluded to ascend for the present.We soon ran out our guide-rope; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very rapidly.The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully.In about 10 minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet.The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the subjacent country—a most romantic one when seen from any point—was now especially sublime.The numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they were filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in inextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of Eastern fable.We were rapidly approaching the mountains in the South, but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety.In a few minutes we soared over them in fine style; and Mr. Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly a dead level.At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen minutes afterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea.We now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys affixed, into the water.This was immediately done, and we commenced a gradual descent.In about 20 minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the touch of the second soon afterward, we remained stationary as to elevation.We were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we put them both into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris.By means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired.Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and dropped in the sea a bottle, inclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention.Hardly, however, had we done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree.The steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car end, (by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up,) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach, from the pivot of the axis of the screw.While we were endeavoring to regain it, our attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong current of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing force, toward the Atlantic.We soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less, certainly, than 50 or 60 miles an hour, so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some 40 miles to our North, before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about.It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary but, to my fancy, a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he was instantly seconded by Mr. Holland-viz.: that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America.After slight reflection, I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which (strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only.As the stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely upon our course.We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea.We perceived the effect of this manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress; and, as the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the guide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel.It is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast.We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of which were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to.We occasioned the greatest excitement on board all—an excitement greatly relished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or fear, to the wind.Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all we were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising distinctness) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs.We kept on in this manner throughout the day with no material incident, and, as the shades of night closed around us, we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed.It could not have been less than 500 miles, and was probably much more.The propeller was kept in constant operation, and, no doubt, aided our progress materially.As the sun went down, the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence.The wind was from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of success.We suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down, and by means of cloaks and a few blankets we did sufficiently well."
"附记（安斯沃思先生所记）：毫无疑问，刚刚过去的九个小时是我一生中最激动的时刻。我想象不出还有什么比这次奇异、危险、新颖的冒险更能使人升华。愿上帝保佑我们成功！我祈求成功不是为了微不足道的个人安全，而是为了人类的知识——为了胜利的伟大。然而，这项壮举竟是如此地明显可行，唯一使我感到惊讶的是为什么人们之前一直犹豫着不去尝试。只要有一股像此刻帮助我们的大风——让这样的一场大风吹着一只气球飘行四五天（这些大风经常能够持续更长时间），就可以在这段时间里轻而易举地把航行者从大洋此岸运送到彼岸。对于这样一场大风来说，辽阔的大西洋仅仅是一个湖泊而已。此时此刻，尽管海面波涛汹涌，但我们身下那海上征服一切的寂静比呈现在眼前的其他所有景象更令我震惊。水面的声音丝毫没有传到天空。辽阔澎湃的大海翻腾着，毫无怨言地忍受着煎熬。如山脉般的惊涛骇浪使人联想到无数个哑然无声的巨魔在徒劳地痛苦挣扎。对我来说，人在这样一个夜晚活着——胜过平平淡淡地活上整个世纪——我也不愿意为了能够庸庸碌碌地活上一百年而放弃这份令人着迷的狂喜。","P.S. (by Mr. Ainsworth.) The last nine hours have been unquestionably the most exciting of my life.I can conceive nothing more sublimating than the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this.May God grant that we succeed!I ask not success for mere safety to my insignificant person, but for the sake of human knowledge and—for the vastness of the triumph.And yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder is why men have scrupled to attempt it before.One single gale such as now befriends us—let such a tempest whirl forward a balloon for 4 or 5 days (these gales often last longer) and the voyager will be easily borne, in that period, from coast to coast.In view of such a gale the broad Atlantic becomes a mere lake.I am more struck, just now, with the supreme silence which reigns in the sea beneath us, notwithstanding its agitation, than with any other phenomenon presenting itself.The waters give up no voice to the Heavens.The immense flaming ocean writhes and is tortured uncomplainingly.The mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony.In a night such as is this to me, a man lives—lives a whole century of ordinary life—nor would I forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence."
"4月7日，星期日（梅森先生的手稿）今天上午十点左右，大风减弱至八九级微风（对海面上的船只而言），大概以每小时30英里或更快的速度推动我们前进。但是，风向已大大偏北。此刻，夕阳西下，我们主要利用螺旋装置和方向舵保持正西航向，它们都出色得满足了需要。我认为这项计划十分成功，在空中朝任意方向随意航行（只要不是正好迎面逆风）已经不再是问题了。我们不可能顶着昨天那样的强风前行，但是如果必要，我们可以通过升高气球来摆脱大风的影响。对于一般的微风，我确信我们能够凭借推动器保持航行。今天中午，我们靠抛弃压舱物上升到约25000英尺（大约是科托帕希火山的高度）的高空。我们这么做的目的是为了寻找更加顺风的气流，但是没有发现比我们目前所乘的风更为有利的了。我们有足够的煤气飞越这个小小的池塘，即便此次航行持续三个星期也没关系。我丝毫不担忧结果。人们一直在不可思议地夸张和误解航行的困难。如果发现所有的气流都对我不利，我可以自己选择气流，我可以通过操纵推动器维持尚且不错的航向。没有什么事件值得我们记录。夜色预示着晴朗的天气。","Sunday, the 7th.(Mr. Mason’s MS.) This morning the gale, by 10, had subsided to an eight—or nine—knot breeze (for a vessel at sea), and bears us, perhaps, 30 miles per hour, or more.It has veered, however, very considerably to the North; and now, at sundown, we are holding our course due West, principally by the screw and rudder, which answer their purposes to admiration.I regard the project as thoroughly successful, and the easy navigation of the air in any direction (not exactly in the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical.We could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday, but, by ascending, we might have got out of its influence, if requisite.Against a pretty stiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our way with the propeller.At noon, today, ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet, (about the height of Cotopaxi) by discharging ballast.Did this to search for a more direct current, but found none so favorable as the one we are now in.We have an abundance of gas to take us across this small pond, even should the voyage last 3 weeks.I have not the slightest fear for the result.The difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended.I can choose my current, and should I find all currents against me, I can make very tolerable headway with the propeller.We have had no incidents worth recording.The night promises fair."
"附记（安斯沃思先生所记）：我没有什么可记录的，除了这件（对我来说十分吃惊的）事情，在相当于科托帕希火山的海拔高度上，我既没有感到极端寒冷，也没有感到头痛或呼吸困难。我发现梅森先生、霍兰先生和埃弗拉德先生也没有这些感觉。奥斯本先生曾抱怨说胸闷——但是这种感觉很快就消失了。白天我们以非常快的速度飘行，飞越大西洋的航行我们肯定已经完成一半多了。我们飞过二三十艘各式各样的船只，船上的人们都显得又惊又喜。乘坐气球跨越海洋根本不是一件很难完成的壮举。未知的事物总被认为是宏伟的。备忘：在25000英尺的高度，天空看上去几乎一团漆黑，而星星清晰可见。海面看起来并不（像人们所推测的那样）是凸面的，而是完全地、明确地呈现凹面。","P.S. (By Mr. Ainsworth.) I have little to record, except the fact (to me quite a surprising one) that, at an elevation equal to that of Cotopaxi, I experienced neither very intense cold, nor headache, nor difficulty of breathing; neither, I find, did Mr. Mason, nor Mr. Holland, nor Sir Everard.Mr. Osborne complained of constriction of the chest—but this soon wore off.We have flown at a great rate during the day, and we must be more than half way across the Atlantic.We have passed over some 20 or 30 vessels of various kinds, and all seem to be delightfully astonished.Crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a feat after all.Omne ignotum pro magnifico.Mem.: at 25,000 feet elevation the sky appears nearly black, and the stars are distinctly visible; while the sea does not seem convex (as one might suppose) but absolutely and most unequivocally concave."
"4月8日，星期一（梅森先生的手稿）今天早上推动器的拉杆又出了点儿麻烦，拉杆务必加以全面改造，以免造成严重事故——我指的是那根钢拉杆，不是叶片。叶片是无法改良的。整个白天一直刮着平稳有力的东北风。到目前为止，命运似乎一直很关照我们。天亮前，气球发出一些奇怪的声音并震动起来，整个飞行器也随之明显地迅速下沉，这使我们多少都有些惊恐。这种现象得以产生是由于空气温度升高，气球里的煤气膨胀，结果崩裂了夜里凝结在气球框架上的小冰粒。我们朝下面的船只扔了几只瓶子。我们看见其中一只被一艘大船捞了起来——好像是一艘纽约航线上的邮船。我们努力辨认船名，但是不能确定。借助奥斯本先生的望远镜我们看出似乎是“亚特兰大号”。此刻是午夜12点，我们仍朝偏西的方向以极快的速度航行。海面发出特有的磷光。","Monday, the 8th.(Mr. Mason’s MS.) This morning we had again some little trouble with the rod of the propeller, which must be entirely remodelled, for fear of serious accident—I mean the steel rod, not the vanes.The latter could not be improved.The wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the North-East all day; and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us.Just before day, we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon, accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine.These phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in the atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night.Threw down several bottles to the vessels below.Saw one of them picked up by a large ship—seemingly one of the New York line packets.Endeavored to make out her name, but could not be sure of it.Mr. Osbornes telescope made it out something like “Atalanta.”It is now 12 at night, and we are still going nearly West, at a rapid pace.The sea is peculiarly phosphorescent."
"附记（安斯沃思先生所记）：现在是凌晨2点钟，海面非常平静，我可以判定——但是这点很难确定，因为我们完全是在借风航行。自从离开威尔沃尔后我就没有睡觉，但是我再也撑不住了，必须得打个盹。我们不会距离美洲海岸太远了。","P.S. (By Mr. Ainsworth.) It is now 2 A.M., and nearly calm, as well as I can judge—but it is very difficult to determine this point since we move with the air so completely.I have not slept since quitting Wheal-Vor, but can stand it no longer, and must take a nap.We cannot be far from the American coast."
"4月9日，星期二（安斯沃思先生的手稿）下午1点，我们把下方南卡罗来纳海岸尽收眼底。这道巨大难题已被解决了。我们飞越了大西洋——驾驶一只气球轻而易举地、顺顺利利地飞越了大西洋！感谢上帝！从此以后谁还能说有什么事情是不可能办到的呢？","Tuesday, the 9th.(Mr. Ainsworth’s MS.) One, P.M. We are in full view of the low coast of South Carolina.The great problem is accomplished.We have crossed the Atlantic—fairly and easily crossed it in a balloon!God be praised!Who shall say that anything is impossible hereafter?"
"日记到此结束。但是，安斯沃思先生对福赛思先生讲了一些降落时的细节。当航行者们第一眼看到海岸线时，几乎已经是风平浪静了，两个海员和奥斯本先生当即就认出了下面的海岸。由于奥斯本先生在莫尔特里要塞有一些熟人，所以我们立即决定在其附近降落。我们操纵气球来到海滩上空（潮水刚刚退去，沙滩坚硬、平坦，刚好适宜降落），铁锚抛下去之后就立刻固定住了。岛上和要塞里的居民蜂拥而至，当然是为了看气球。但是，他们相信这次实实在在的航行——飞越大西洋——是极其困难的。铁锚触地的时间恰好是下午2点整，因此，完成整个航行用时75小时。如果只计算海岸到海岸所花的时间将会更短。没有任何重大事故发生。整个期间没有感觉到任何真正的危险。我们给气球排气，并捆扎收好，这毫不费事。当这篇叙述性报道的手稿被编辑好从查尔斯顿发出之时，航行者们还呆在莫尔特里要塞。他们的接下来的计划尚未确定。但是，本报有信心向读者保证：在星期一，或最迟星期二就能读到进一步消息。","The Journal here ceases.Some particulars of the descent were communicated, however, by Mr. Ainsworth to Mr. Forsyth.It was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast, which was immediately recognized by both the seamen, and by Mr. Osborne.The latter gentleman having acquaintances at Fort Moultrie, it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity.The balloon was brought over the beach (the tide being out and the sand hard, smooth, and admirably adapted for a descent), and the grapnel let go, which took firm hold at once.The inhabitants of the Island, and of the Fort, thronged out, of course, to see the balloon; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyage—the crossing of the Atlantic.The grapnel caught at 2 P.M. precisely; and thus the whole voyage was completed in 75 hours; or rather less, counting from shore to shore.No serious accident occurred.No real danger was at any time apprehended.The balloon was exhausted and secured without trouble; and when the MS. from which this narrative is compiled was despatched from Charleston, the party were still at Fort Moultrie.Their further intentions were not ascertained; but we can safely promise our readers some additional information either on Monday or in the course of the next day, at furthest."
"这无疑是人类迄今为止所完成的、乃至所尝试的最惊人、最有趣、最重要的壮举。接下来将会有什么重大事件发生，现在做断言是毫无意义的。","This is unquestionably the most stupendous, the most interesting, and the most important undertaking ever accomplished or even attempted by man.What magnificent events may ensue, it would be useless now to think of determining."
