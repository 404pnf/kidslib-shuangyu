"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London "
"“那么我必须，那么我必须，现在离开这个城镇吗？——而你，我的爱，留在这儿？”——施瓦宾民歌。","“Must I, then, must I, then, now leave this town—And you, my love, stay here?”—Schwabian Folk-song."
"这个歌手脸庞干净，眼睛明亮。他弯腰给锅里炖着的豆子添水，然后直起身来，手里握着一根柴火，将围着餐盒和烹饪用具打转的狗儿从那儿赶开。他那蓝色的眼睛、金黄色的长发，以及他那精力充沛、朝气蓬勃的样子，让人看着就心情愉快。在生长密集、冰雪覆盖着的那一溜儿松树的白松顶上，一轮新月洒落一角暗淡的光辉，松树环绕着营地，将它与整个世界隔绝开来。头顶的星空如此清冷，星星快速地、有规律地闪动着。东南方，浅绿色的光晕逐渐消散，预示着北极光带来的狂欢要开始了。在最近的一块显眼的地方，有两个人躺在熊皮上，以此为床。在熊皮和光秃秃的雪之间是一层六英寸厚的松树枝。毯子被卷起来了。在他们背后，有一块帆布——一块挂在两棵树之间被扯成四十五度的帆布，作为保护屏障。帆布留住火焰辐射开来的热量并反射回到熊皮上。另一个人坐在雪橇上，靠近火焰，正修补着鹿皮鞋。右边，一堆冻结的碎石和一个简陋的绞盘表明他们每天在沼泽地艰难地寻找富矿脉。左边，立着四双雪地鞋表明了他们在离开营地那踩平的雪后所使用的行走工具。","The singer, clean-faced and cheery-eyed, bent over and added water to a pot of simmering beans, and then, rising, a stick of firewood in hand, drove back the circling dogs from the grub-box and cooking-gear.He was blue of eye, and his long hair was golden, and it was a pleasure to look upon his lusty freshness.A new moon was thrusting a dim horn above the white line of close-packed snow-capped pines which ringed the camp and segregated it from all the world.Overhead, so clear it was and cold, the stars danced with quick, pulsating movements.To the southeast an evanescent greenish glow heralded the opening revels of the aurora borealis.Two men, in the immediate foreground, lay upon the bearskin which was their bed.Between the skin and naked snow was a six-inch layer of pine boughs.The blankets were rolled back.For shelter, there was a fly at their backs,—a sheet of canvas stretched between two trees and angling at forty-five degrees.This caught the radiating heat from the fire and flung it down upon the skin.Another man sat on a sled, drawn close to the blaze, mending moccasins.To the right, a heap of frozen gravel and a rude windlass denoted where they toiled each day in dismal groping for the pay-streak.To the left, four pairs of snowshoes stood erect, showing the mode of travel which obtained when the stamped snow of the camp was left behind."
"施瓦宾民歌在寒冷的北部星空下听起来不可思议地悲哀，对辛苦了一天在火焰旁消磨时间的人没有任何益处。这让他们的心隐隐作痛，带来了一种类似腹中饥饿的渴望，使得他们的灵魂向南探索着，越过了分水岭到达阳光地带。","That Schwabian folk-song sounded strangely pathetic under the cold northern stars, and did not do the men good who lounged about the fire after the toil of the day.It put a dull ache into their hearts, and a yearning which was akin to belly-hunger, and sent their souls questing southward across the divides to the sun-lands."
"“看在上帝的分上，西格蒙德，闭嘴！”其中的一个人告诫道。他痛苦地紧握着双手，但却将双手藏在身下的熊皮褶皱里。","“For the love of God, Sigmund, shut up!” expostulated one of the men.His hands were clenched painfully, but he hid them from sight in the folds of the bearskin upon which he lay."
"“为什么，戴夫·沃茨？”西格蒙德问，“我心里快活时，为什么不能唱歌？”","“And what for, Dave Wertz?”Sigmund demanded.“Why shall I not sing when the heart is glad?”"
"“因为没人叫你唱，这就是原因。看看你，兄弟，想想过去的十二个月里我们用来糟蹋我们身体的食物，想想我们像牲畜一样的生活和劳作方式！”","“Because you’ve got no call to, that’s why.Look about you, man, and think of the grub we’ve been defiling our bodies with for the last twelvemonth, and the way we’ve lived and worked like beasts!”"
"金发的西格蒙德因此只得放弃歌唱，他四周环顾，打量着快被严寒冻坏的狼狗和大家呼出的白气。“为什么心里会不快活呢？”他笑了，“很好；都很好。至于食物嘛——”他弯起胳膊，抚摸着隆起的二头肌，“若说我们生活和工作得像野兽一样，那我们领工钱时不也像国王一样？二十美元到了盆地矿脉就运转起来，我们知道那将会有八英尺厚。又一个克朗代克——我们知道它——那边的吉姆·霍斯，你胳膊肘旁的那个人，他也知道这个的，他可没抱怨。还有希契科克！他像个老妇人一样缝着鹿皮鞋，听候着时间的流逝。只有你等不及了，不想工作到春天洗矿精矿的时候了。那时我们全都会富有，跟国王一样富有，只有你等不及了。你想要回到美国去。我也是，我出生在那里，但我能够等，等到洼地里的金矿每天就像搅乳里的黄油一样显露出来。你想要你的美好时光，但你现在却像个孩子一样吵着要。呸！为什么我不能歌唱：","Thus abjured, Sigmund, the golden-haired, surveyed it all, and the frost-rimmed wolf-dogs and the vapor breaths of the men.“And why shall not the heart be glad?” he laughed.“It is good; it is all good.As for the grub—” He doubled up his arm and caressed the swelling biceps.“And if we have lived and worked like beasts, have we not been paid like kings?Twenty dollars to the pan the streak is running, and we know it to be eight feet thick.It is another Klondike—and we know it—Jim Hawes there, by your elbow, knows it and complains not.And there’s Hitchcock!He sews moccasins like an old woman, and waits against the time.Only you can’t wait and work until the wash-up in the spring.Then we shall all be rich, rich as kings, only you cannot wait.You want to go back to the States.So do I, and I was born there, but I can wait, when each day the gold in the pan shows up yellow as butter in the churning.But you want your good time, and, like a child, you cry for it now.Bah!Why shall I not sing:"
"“一年以后，一年以后，当葡萄成熟时，我将不再离开。那时如果你的感情依旧真切，我的爱，那将是我们结婚的日子。一年以后，一年以后，若你的感情已不再，那时我将永远地生活在你的爱里面。那时如果你的感情依旧真切，我的爱，那将是我们结婚的日子。”","“In a year, in a year, when the grapes are ripe, I shall stay no more away.Then if you still are true, my love, It will be our wedding day.In a year, in a year, when my time is past, Then I’ll live in your love for aye.Then if you still are true, my love, It will be our wedding day.”"
"那些狗，毛发竖立，咆哮着，越来越靠近火光。这时传来了雪鞋踩在雪地上发出的那种单调的嘎吱嘎吱声，这嘎吱声中间，还夹杂着拖着鞋跟行走发出的像筛糖一样的声响。西格蒙德突然停止了歌唱，破口大骂起来，将柴火扔向动物们。接着火光被一个穿着毛皮的身影隔开，一个印第安女孩脱掉雪鞋，拉下她松鼠皮质风雪大衣的兜帽，站在他们中间。西格蒙德和坐在熊皮上的人们用惯常的“你好”问候她，把她称呼为“赛普苏”，但希契科克给她在雪橇上腾出了地儿，那样她可以坐在他旁边。","The dogs, bristling and growling, drew in closer to the firelight.There was a monotonous crunch-crunch of webbed shoes, and between each crunch the dragging forward of the heel of the shoe like the sound of sifting sugar.Sigmund broke off from his song to hurl oaths and firewood at the animals.Then the light was parted by a fur-clad figure, and an Indian girl slipped out of the webs, threw back the hood of her squirrel-skin parka, and stood in their midst.Sigmund and the men on the bearskin greeted her as “Sipsu,” with the customary “Hello,” but Hitchcock made room on the sled that she might sit beside him."
"“近来怎样，赛普苏？”他问道，按她的方式，用蹩脚的英语混杂着不标准的切努克语谈话，“营地里的饥饿依然很严重吗？巫医已经找到猎物稀少和这片土地没有驼鹿的原因了吗？”","“And how goes it, Sipsu?” he asked, talking, after her fashion, in broken English and bastard Chinook.“Is the hunger still mighty in the camp? and has the witch doctor yet found the cause wherefore game is scarce and no moose in the land?”"
"“是的，虽然如此。野味也几乎没了，我们准备吃狗。巫医也找出了所有这些罪恶的根源，明天他将会做祭品，净化营地。”","“Yes; even so.There is little game, and we prepare to eat the dogs.Also has the witch doctor found the cause of all this evil, and to-morrow will he make sacrifice and cleanse the camp.”"
"“祭品可能是什么呢？——一个新生婴儿，还是某个年迈体衰的可怜女人？因为这女人是部落的麻烦，所以最好处置掉？”","“And what does the sacrifice chance to be?—a new-born babe or some poor devil of a squaw, old and shaky, who is a care to the tribe and better out of the way?”"
"“碰巧没那么明智，因为需求很大，他选的不是别人，正是首领的女儿；不是别人正是我，赛普苏。”","“It chanced not that wise; for the need was great, and he chose none other than the chief’s daughter; none other than I, Sipsu.”"
"“该死！”这句话慢慢溜到了希契科克的嘴边，说了出来，声音圆润深沉，说话的方式表明了他的惊愕和关心。","“Hell!”The word rose slowly to Hitchcock’s lips, and brimmed over full and deep, in a way which bespoke wonder and consideration."
"“因此我们，你和我，站在了小径的岔路口，”她平静地继续说着，“我来是为了我们可以再见彼此一面，仅仅一面。”","“Wherefore we stand by a forking of the trail, you and I,” she went on calmly, “and I have come that we may look once more upon each other, and once more only.”"
"她生来就有原始人的血统，原始已经成为她的习惯和她的生活；所以她坚忍地对待生活，认为人类作为祭品是自然秩序的一部分。统治着白天黑夜、洪水霜冻、蓓蕾绽放和叶子枯萎的力量愤怒了，需要抚慰。它们用很多方式索取——恶水区的死亡、暗藏危险的冰壳、被灰熊抓住，或者使一种消耗性疾病降临在一个独居的男人身上，直到他咳嗽得肺在他的口鼻间失去了活力。这些力量也收到了祭品。这都一样。那个巫医通晓那些力量的思想，作出正确的抉择。那是很自然的。死亡以多种方式呈现，但最终结果都一样——全能和神秘的一种表现方式。","She was born of primitive stock, and primitive had been her traditions and her days; so she regarded life stoically, and human sacrifice as part of the natural order.The powers which ruled the day-light and the dark, the flood and the frost, the bursting of the bud and the withering of the leaf, were angry and in need of propitiation.This they exacted in many ways,—death in the bad water, through the treacherous ice-crust, by the grip of the grizzly, or a wasting sickness which fell upon a man in his own lodge till he coughed, and the life of his lungs went out through his mouth and nostrils.Likewise did the powers receive sacrifice.It was all one.And the witch doctor was versed in the thoughts of the powers and chose unerringly.It was very natural.Death came by many ways, yet was it all one after all,—a manifestation of the all-powerful and inscrutable."
"但希契科克出身于一个后起的人类血统。他的传统没那具体，毫无敬畏，他说：“不是这样的，赛普苏。你还年轻，还没有完全享受生活的乐趣。那个巫医是个傻瓜，他的抉择很邪恶。这件事情不能这样解决。”","But Hitchcock came of a later world-breed.His traditions were less concrete and without reverence, and he said, “Not so, Sipsu.You are young, and yet in the full joy of life.The witch doctor is a fool, and his choice is evil.This thing shall not be.”"
"她微笑着回答：“由于许多原因，生活并不友好。首先，它使我们俩一个是白种人而另一个是印第安人，这很糟糕。然后它使我们的道路相交，现在又将它们分开；而我们无能为力。以前有一次，众神发怒时，你的同胞们来到了营地。他们有三个人，都是大个子白人，他们说这件事情不能这样解决。但他们很快就死掉了，结果就是这样。”","She smiled and answered, “Life is not kind, and for many reasons.First, it made of us twain the one white and the other Indian, which is bad.Then it crossed our trails, and now it parts them again; and we can do nothing.Once before, when the gods were angry, did your brothers come to the camp.They were three, big men and white, and they said the thing shall not be.But they died quickly, and the thing was.”"
"希契科克点点头表示他听说了，半转过身，提高了声音：“听着，伙计们！营地里正发生着很多蠢事，他们准备谋杀赛普苏。你们怎么说？”","Hitchcock nodded that he heard, half-turned, and lifted his voice.“Look here, you fellows!There’s a lot of foolery going on over to the camp, and they’re getting ready to murder Sipsu.What d’ye say?”"
"沃茨看看霍斯，霍斯也看看他，但是两个人都没说话。西格蒙德低下头，轻抚他膝间的牧羊犬。他将这只牧羊犬从外面带进来，非常看重这个动物。事实上，有个女孩，占据了他的思绪，他胸前小盒子里她的照片经常激发他歌唱，当他们吻别，他开始去北部地带探索的时候，她给了他这条狗连同她的祝福。","Wertz looked at Hawes, and Hawes looked back, but neither spoke.Sigmund dropped his head, and petted the shepherd dog between his knees.He had brought Shep in with him from the outside, and thought a great deal of the animal.In fact, a certain girl, who was much in his thoughts, and whose picture in the little locket on his breast often inspired him to sing, had given him the dog and her blessing when they kissed good-bye and he started on his Northland quest."
"“你们怎么说？”希契科克重复了一遍。","“What d’ye say?”Hitchcock repeated."
"“或许没有这么严重，”霍斯深思熟虑后回答道，“极有可能这仅仅是一个女孩的谎话。”","“Mebbe it’s not so serious,” Hawes answered with deliberation.“Most likely it’s only a girl’s story.”"
"“那不是重点！”希契科克觉察到了他们明显的不情愿，一股怒火掠过了他的心头。“问题是，如果是这样呢，我们就容忍它吗？我们要做什么？”","“That isn’t the point!”Hitchcock felt a hot flush of anger sweep over him at their evident reluctance.“The question is, if it is so, are we going to stand it?What are we going to do?”"
"“我觉得没必要介入，”沃茨说话了，“如果是这样，是这样的话，就让它这样好了。这就是这些人做事的方式。是他们的宗教信仰，不关我们的事。我们关心的是得到金粉，离开这片被上帝所抛弃的土地。这里不是只适合野兽吗？那除了野兽，这些黑色恶魔是什么？况且，这会是一个非常低劣的手段。”","“I don’t see any call to interfere,” spoke up Wertz.“If it is so, it is so, and that’s all there is about it.It’s a way these people have of doing.It’s their religion, and it’s no concern of ours.Our concern is to get the dust and then get out of this God-forsaken land.’T isn’t fit for naught else but beasts?And what are these black devils but beasts?Besides, it’d be damn poor policy.”"
"“这正是我所说的，”霍斯插话道，“我们在这里，我们只有四个人，距离育空河或另一个白人有三百英里。我们能做什么去反对五十个印第安人呢？如果跟他们吵架，我们就只能溜走；如果跟他们打架，我们就会被消灭。此外，我们的工资会受到影响，神可作证！我，就个人而言，要忠于它！”","“That’s what I say,” chimed in Hawes.“Here we are, four of us, three hundred miles from the Yukon or a white face.And what can we do against half-a-hundred Indians?If we quarrel with them, we have to vamose; if we fight, we are wiped out.Further, we’ve struck pay, and, by God!I, for one, am going to stick by it!”"
"“我同意。”沃茨补充道。","“Ditto here,” supplemented Wertz."
"希契科克急躁地转过身对着西格蒙德，他正轻声歌唱：","Hitchcock turned impatiently to Sigmund, who was softly singing,—"
"“一年以后，一年以后，葡萄成熟时，我将不再离开。”","“In a year, in a year, when the grapes are ripe, I shall stay no more away.”"
"“好吧，是这样的，希契科克，”他最后说道，“我和其余的人面临同样的处境。如果那六十个印第安人都下定决心杀死那个女孩，哎呀，我们无能为力。一次鲁莽行动，然后我们就会从这片风景中被清除。那样做有什么好处？他们会仍然会杀死那个女孩。反对一个民族的风俗是没用的，除非你有力量。”","“Well, it’s this way, Hitchcock,” he finally said, “I’m in the same boat with the rest.If three-score bucks have made up their mind to kill the girl, why, we can’t help it.One rush, and we’d be wiped off the landscape.And what good’d that be?They’d still have the girl.There’s no use in going against the customs of a people except you’re in force.”"
"“但是我们有力量！”希契科克打断了他的话，“四个白人敌得过一百倍多的印第安人。想想那个女孩！”","“But we are in force!”Hitchcock broke in.“Four whites are a match for a hundred times as many Indians.And think of the girl!”"
"西格蒙德抚摸着那条狗，陷入了沉思。“但我的确想着那个女孩呢。她的眼睛如夏天的天空一样蓝，笑声如夏季的海洋，头发是黄色的，像我的一样,编成的辫子跟一个高个子男人的胳膊一样长。她正等着我呢，就在那里，一个更美好的地方。她等了很久，现在我的大笔钱财在望，我不会抛弃它的。”","Sigmund stroked the dog meditatively.“But I do think of the girl.And her eyes are blue like summer skies, and laughing like summer seas, and her hair is yellow, like mine, and braided in ropes the size of a big man’s arms.She’s waiting for me, out there, in a better land.And she’s waited long, and now my pile’s in sight I’m not going to throw it away.”"
"“我直视那个女孩蓝色的眼睛，想起双手沾满那个黑色眼睛的女孩的鲜血时，我会觉得羞愧的。”希契科克冷笑道,因为他生来就正直勇敢，只是就事做事，不会停下来掂量权衡。","“And shamed I would be to look into the girl’s blue eyes and remember the black ones of the girl whose blood was on my hands,” Hitchcock sneered; for he was born to honor and championship, and to do the thing for the thing’s sake, nor stop to weigh or measure."
"西格蒙德摇摇头。“你不能逼疯我，希契科克，我也不会因你的疯狂去做傻事。这是一个冷酷的交易提议和现实问题。我不是为了我的健康来到这个国家的，此外，我们不可能帮得上忙的。如果是这样的话，对这个女孩来说太糟糕了，仅此而已。那是她的民族的一种方式，只是碰巧这次我们在场。他们几千年来一直这么做，他们现在会这样做，将来也会继续这么做的。况且，他们跟我们不是同一种族。那个女孩也不是。不，我跟沃茨和霍斯是一个立场，而——”","Sigmund shook his head.“You can’t make me mad, Hitchcock, nor do mad things because of your madness.It’s a cold business proposition and a question of facts.I didn’t come to this country for my health, and, further, it’s impossible for us to raise a hand.If it is so, it is too bad for the girl, that’s all.It’s a way of her people, and it just happens we’re on the spot this one time.They’ve done the same for a thousand-thousand years, and they’re going to do it now, and they’ll go on doing it for all time to come.Besides, they’re not our kind.Nor’s the girl.No, I take my stand with Wertz and Hawes, and—”"
"但那些狗咆哮着靠近了，他突然停下来，听到了许多雪鞋的嘎吱声。印第安人一个跟一个地高视阔步走入火光，高大而冷酷，穿着毛皮沉默不语，他们的影子在雪地上古怪地舞动着。一个人，那个巫医，粗声粗气地和赛普苏说话。他的脸上涂抹着原始的油漆斑点，肩上披着狼皮，狼白森森的牙齿和让人看着难受的大鼻子覆盖在他的头上。其他什么话都没有说。探矿者保持平静。赛普苏站起身穿上雪鞋。","But the dogs snarled and drew in, and he broke off, listening to the crunch-crunch of many snowshoes.Indian after Indian stalked into the firelight, tall and grim, fur-clad and silent, their shadows dancing grotesquely on the snow.One, the witch doctor, spoke gutturally to Sipsu.His face was daubed with savage paint blotches, and over his shoulders was drawn a wolfskin, the gleaming teeth and cruel snout surmounting his head.No other word was spoken.The prospectors held the peace.Sipsu arose and slipped into her snowshoes."
"“再见，哦，我的男人。”她对希契科克说。但雪橇上坐在她旁边的那个男人没做任何反应，当他们排成纵队进入大雪覆盖的森林时，他也没抬头。","“Good-by, O my man,” she said to Hitchcock.But the man who had sat beside her on the sled gave no sign, nor lifted his head as they filed away into the white forest."
"跟很多男人不同，他的适应能力，尽管很强，却从来想到过与北部地区的女人联盟的权宜之计。他广泛的世界大同主义从来没有萌生过与本地出生的女人订立婚约的冲动。如果有过，他的生活哲学就不会居于两者之间。但并不是这么简单。赛普苏？他很高兴跟她在营火旁聊天，不是作为一个将他自己看做男人而将她看做女人的男人，而是作为一个可能有小孩的男人，作为一个只是为了改变单调生活方式的乏味性而形成的男人。仅此而已。但他的体内流淌着某种骑士般兴奋的热血，尽管他有美国佬的血统和新英格兰的教养，他这种特质使他生命中商业的那方面经常看似无意义，并跟他更深的冲动相矛盾。","Unlike many men, his faculty of adaptation, while large, had never suggested the expediency of an alliance with the women of the Northland.His broad cosmopolitanism had never impelled toward covenanting in marriage with the daughters of the soil.If it had, his philosophy of life would not have stood between.But it simply had not.Sipsu?He had pleasured in camp-fire chats with her, not as a man who knew himself to be man and she woman, but as a man might with a child, and as a man of his make certainly would if for no other reason than to vary the tedium of a bleak existence.That was all.But there was a certain chivalric thrill of warm blood in him, despite his Yankee ancestry and New England upbringing, and he was so made that the commercial aspect of life often seemed meaningless and bore contradiction to his deeper impulses."
"所以他沉默不语地坐在那里，头前倾着，比他自身更强大的一种生物力量，跟他的种族一样强大，在他体内发挥着作用。沃茨和霍斯不时地横眼看看他，举止中有种微弱但能察觉得到的的惶恐。西格蒙德也感觉到了这一点。希契科克很强壮，在他们不稳定的生活中的很多事情上，他的力量给他们留下了很深印象。对于他采取行动时会怎么做，他们处于某种明确的敬畏和好奇状态。","So he sat silent, with head bowed forward, an organic force, greater than himself, as great as his race, at work within him.Wertz and Hawes looked askance at him from time to time, a faint but perceptible trepidation in their manner.Sigmund also felt this.Hitchcock was strong, and his strength had been impressed upon them in the course of many an event in their precarious life.So they stood in a certain definite awe and curiosity as to what his conduct would be when he moved to action."
"但他沉默了很长时间，火都快灭了，这时沃茨伸展双臂打着哈欠，打算去睡觉了。那时，希契科克站了起来，站得笔直。","But his silence was long, and the fire nigh out, when Wertz stretched his arms and yawned, and thought he’d go to bed.Then Hitchcock stood up his full height."
"“愿上帝罚你们的灵魂下最深的地狱，你们这些软弱的胆小鬼！我要和你们断交！”他相当冷静地说着，但他说出的每个音节、每个声调的力量都表明了他的意图。“来吧，”他继续着，“分配一下，你们想怎么分就怎么分。这些物品中我拥有四分之一；我们的合同说明了这点。试验洼地的麻布袋里有二十五或三十盎司。拿出天平。我们现在就分。而你，西格蒙德，称出四分之一的食物给我，把它分开。其中有四条狗是我的，我想额外再要四条。我用我那部分营地装备和采矿工具来跟你们换狗。我会放弃六、七盎司和45到90的备用品来换弹药。你们怎么说？”","“May God damn your souls to the deepest hells, you chicken-hearted cowards!I’m done with you!”He said it calmly enough, but his strength spoke in every syllable, and every intonation was advertisement of intention.“Come on,” he continued, “whack up, and in whatever way suits you best.I own a quarter-interest in the claims; our contracts show that.There’re twenty-five or thirty ounces in the sack from the test pans.Fetch out the scales.We’ll divide that now.And you, Sigmund, measure me my quarter-share of the grub and set it apart.Four of the dogs are mine, and I want four more.I’ll trade you my share in the camp outfit and mining-gear for the dogs.And I’ll throw in my six or seven ounces and the spare 45-90 with the ammunition.What d’ye say?”"
"三个人到一边商量去了。他们回来了，西格蒙德担当发言人的角色。“我们要跟你平均分配，希契科克。每样东西你都会得到四分之一，不多也不少；你可以带走或留下它。但我们也和你一样非常想要那些狗，所以给你四条，就这么定了。如果你不想要你那份装备和工具，咳，那是你自己的事。如果你要，就带走它；如果你不要，就将它留下。”","The three men drew apart and conferred.When they returned, Sigmund acted as spokesman.“We’ll whack up fair with you, Hitchcock.In everything you’ll get your quarter-share, neither more nor less; and you can take it or leave it.But we want the dogs as bad as you do, so you get four, and that’s all.If you don’t want to take your share of the outfit and gear, why, that’s your lookout.If you want it, you can have it; if you don’t, leave it.”"
"“法律条文，”希契科克冷笑道，“就这样吧。我愿意。快点儿。我迫不及待地要离开这个营地，远离这里的败类。”","“The letter of the law,” Hitchcock sneered.“But go ahead.I’m willing.And hurry up.I can’t get out of this camp and away from its vermin any too quick.”"
"分配生效，没有异议。他将少得可怜的物品捆扎到其中一个雪橇上，牵着他的四条狗，给它们套上挽具。他没有碰他那份装备和工具，但他将六条狗的挽具扔到了雪橇上，眼睛瞪着他们使他们不敢干涉。但他们耸耸肩膀，注视着他消失在森林里。","The division was effected without further comment.He lashed his meagre belongings upon one of the sleds, rounded in his four dogs, and harnessed up.His portion of outfit and gear he did not touch, though he threw onto the sled half a dozen dog harnesses, and challenged them with his eyes to interfere.But they shrugged their shoulders and watched him disappear in the forest."
"一个男人匍匐着爬过雪地。四周隐约可见营地的鹿皮小屋。各处都有一条痛苦的狗对着邻近他的人或嚎叫或咆哮。一次，其中一条靠近那个爬行的男人，而他就一动不动了。那条狗靠近一些，闻着，靠得更近了，直到它的鼻子碰到了那个陌生的物体，但夜幕降临时，那陌生物体就不在那里了。然后希契科克，因为那就是希契科克，突然站起来，挥出一只没戴手套的手掐住那畜生毛茸茸的喉咙。那条狗知道它死在那只手上了。那个男人继续前行，星空下留下了一条被扭断了脖子的狗。希契科克用这种方式到达了首领的小屋。他在雪地里躺了很久，既没听听居住者说话，也没有努力去找赛普苏。很明显帐篷里有很多人，从声音里能听出他们处于高度的兴奋中。最后他听到了那个女孩的声音，于是爬到另一面，这样他们之间只隔着鹿皮。接着他在雪里打了个洞，头和肩膀在底部慢慢蠕动着。室内的温暖空气扑面而来，他停下来等待着，他的腿和大部分身体仍然在室外。他什么都看不到，也不敢抬头。他的一侧是一个皮包。他能闻到气味，但他仔细地摸摸来确认一下。另一侧他的脸刚刚碰到一个皮毛外衣，他知道里面裹着一个人。这一定是赛普苏。尽管他希望她会再次说话，他决心冒次险。","A man crawled upon his belly through the snow.On every hand loomed the moose-hide lodges of the camp.Here and there a miserable dog howled or snarled abuse upon his neighbor.Once, one of them approached the creeping man, but the man became motionless.The dog came closer and sniffed, and came yet closer, till its nose touched the strange object which had not been there when darkness fell.Then Hitchcock, for it was Hitchcock, upreared suddenly, shooting an unmittened hand out to the brute’s shaggy throat.And the dog knew its death in that clutch, and when the man moved on, was left broken-necked under the stars.In this manner Hitchcock made the chief’s lodge.For long he lay in the snow without, listening to the voices of the occupants and striving to locate Sipsu.Evidently there were many in the tent, and from the sounds they were in high excitement.At last he heard the girl’s voice, and crawled around so that only the moose-hide divided them.Then burrowing in the snow, he slowly wormed his head and shoulders underneath.When the warm inner air smote his face, he stopped and waited, his legs and the greater part of his body still on the outside.He could see nothing, nor did he dare lift his head.On one side of him was a skin bale.He could smell it, though he carefully felt to be certain.On the other side his face barely touched a furry garment which he knew clothed a body.This must be Sipsu.Though he wished she would speak again, he resolved to risk it."
"他能听到首领和巫医高声谈论着，在远处的角落里，某个饥饿的孩子抽泣着要睡觉。他侧身蠕动，小心地抬起头，仍然只是碰到了那件毛皮外衣。他听着呼吸声。那是一个女人的呼吸声；他要冒次险。","He could hear the chief and the witch doctor talking high, and in a far corner some hungry child whimpering to sleep.Squirming over on his side, he carefully raised his head, still just touching the furry garment.He listened to the breathing.It was a woman’s breathing; he would chance it."
"他温柔但坚定地压在她的一侧，感觉一碰她，她吓了一跳。他再次等着，直到一只探寻的手滑过他的头顶，停在了他的卷发里。接着那只手温柔地抬起他的脸，他凝望着赛普苏的眼睛。","He pressed against her side softly but firmly, and felt her start at the contact.Again he waited, till a questioning hand slipped down upon his head and paused among the curls.The next instant the hand turned his face gently upward, and he was gazing into Sipsu’s eyes."
"她相当镇定。她若无其事地换了位置，将胳膊肘放在皮包上，身体靠在上面，整理了一下她的风雪大衣。这样他就完全被盖住了。然后，她仍然非常随意地斜倚在他身上，以便他能在她的胳膊和胸脯之间呼吸，她低头时，耳朵轻轻地压在他的嘴唇上。","She was quite collected.Changing her position casually, she threw an elbow well over on the skin bale, rested her body upon it, and arranged her parka.In this way he was completely concealed.Then, and still most casually, she reclined across him, so that he could breathe between her arm and breast, and when she lowered her head her ear pressed lightly against his lips."
"“时机合适的时候，你就走,”他低语道，“离开小屋穿过雪地，顺风而下到小河弯道的那片加拿大短叶松那里去。在那里你会找到我的狗和雪橇，上路的东西已经打包好了。今晚我们去育空河；既然我们要走快点儿，你要向靠近你的狗下手，抓住它们的颈背，将它们拉到在小河弯道处的雪橇那里。”","“When the time suits, go thou,” he whispered, “out of the lodge and across the snow, down the wind to the bunch of jackpine in the curve of the creek.There wilt thou find my dogs and my sled, packed for the trail.This night we go down to the Yukon; and since we go fast, lay thou hands upon what dogs come nigh thee, by the scruff of the neck, and drag them to the sled in the curve of the creek.”"
"赛普苏摇摇头表示不同意；但她的眼睛闪着愉悦的光辉，为这个男人表现出的对她的喜爱之情而感到骄傲。但她，跟她民族中的所有女人一样，生来就要服从男人的意愿，当希契科克有权威地重复道“走！”时，虽然她没做回答，但他知道他的意愿就是法律。","Sipsu shook her head in dissent; but her eyes glistened with gladness, and she was proud that this man had shown toward her such favor.But she, like the women of all her race, was born to obey the will masculine, and when Hitchcock repeated “Go!” he did it with authority, and though she made no answer he knew that his will was law."
"“不要管狗的挽具，”他补充道，并准备着出发，“我要等会儿。但不会浪费时间。白天赶走夜晚，它也不会为男人的欢愉而逗留。”","“And never mind harness for the dogs,” he added, preparing to go.“I shall wait.But waste no time.The day chaseth the night alway, nor does it linger for man’s pleasure.”"
"半小时后，在雪橇旁跺着脚摆动着胳膊的他，看到她来了，每只手上都有一条乖戾的狗儿。当他们靠近时，他自己的狗变得越来越好战，他用鞭柄那端爱抚着它们，直到它们安静下来。他逆着风向靠近营地，声响是最可怕的，那能暴露他的行踪。","Half an hour later, stamping his feet and swinging his arms by the sled, he saw her coming, a surly dog in either hand.At the approach of these his own animals waxed truculent, and he favored them with the butt of his whip till they quieted.He had approached the camp up the wind, and sound was the thing to be most feared in making his presence known."
"“把它们放到雪橇上。”她给那两条狗系上挽具后，他命令道，“我想让我的头领狗在前面。”","“Put them into the sled,” he ordered when she had got the harness on the two dogs.“I want my leaders to the fore.”"
"但当她做完这些，被取代了位置的动物向这些陌生动物扑去。尽管希契科克在它们中间插入棍状步枪，但一阵嘈杂声起，横越沉睡的营地。","But when she had done this, the displaced animals pitched upon the aliens.Though Hitchcock plunged among them with clubbed rifle, a riot of sound went up and across the sleeping camp."
"“现在我们就有充足的狗了，”他严肃地说着，从雪橇捆扎物里抽出一把斧头，“你要把我扔给你的每样东西都绑上，偶尔保护一下这个团队。”","“Now we shall have dogs, and in plenty,” he remarked grimly, slipping an axe from the sled lashings.“Do thou harness whichever I fling thee, and betweenwhiles protect the team.”"
"他向前迈一步，在两棵松树间等着。营地里的狗叫声打破了夜晚的宁静，而他则等待着它们的到来。一个黑点，迅速变大，借着广阔雪地的昏暗光线变得明显。它是一群狗的前锋，利落地跳着，用狼的方式，朝着它的伙伴叫着。希契科克站在暗处。它跳过去的时候，他伸出手，抓住它还未落地的前腿，将它旋转着甩向地面。接着在耳朵下方给了它恰当的一击，将它扔给了赛普苏。当她在挽具上鼓掌时，他，拿着他的斧子，就守住树木间的过道，直到一大批白牙和闪光的眼睛蜂拥而至，多到简直抓不过来。赛普苏快速劳作着。当她完工时，他跳向前，抓住了另一条将其打昏，扔给了她。他又重复了三次，这时雪橇队有十条狗咆哮着，他喊道，“够了！”","He stepped a space in advance and waited between two pines.The dogs of the camp were disturbing the night with their jangle, and he watched for their coming.A dark spot, growing rapidly, took form upon the dim white expanse of snow.It was a forerunner of the pack, leaping cleanly, and, after the wolf fashion, singing direction to its brothers.Hitchcock stood in the shadow.As it sprang past, he reached out, gripped its forelegs in mid-career, and sent it whirling earthward.Then he struck it a well-judged blow beneath the ear, and flung it to Sipsu.And while she clapped on the harness, he, with his axe, held the passage between the trees, till a shaggy flood of white teeth and glistening eyes surged and crested just beyond reach.Sipsu worked rapidly.When she had finished, he leaped forward, seized and stunned a second, and flung it to her.This he repeated thrice again, and when the sled team stood snarling in a string of ten, he called, “Enough!”"
"但这时，一个年轻的印第安人，部落的前锋，动作敏捷，左右拍打着，艰难地穿过狗群，企图穿过过道。希契科克步枪的枪柄打在他的膝盖上，由此他侧身摔倒了。那个巫医，精力充沛地跑着，看到了这一猛击。","But at this instant a young buck, the forerunner of the tribe, and swift of limb, wading through the dogs and cuffing right and left, attempted the passage.The butt of Hitchcock’s rifle drove him to his knees, whence he toppled over sideways.The witch doctor, running lustily, saw the blow fall."
"希契科克向赛普苏喊着快跑。她尖叫一声“驾！”，发狂的野兽们飞速向前奔跑，而雪橇猛烈地弹跳着，她差点儿就从上面摔下来。那些力量很明显对巫医很生气，因为这时他们将他猛地冲撞到了小径上。领头的狗缠住了他的雪鞋，把他绊倒在地，随后的九条狗将他踩在脚下，雪橇也从他身上冲过。但他很快就站了起来，这个夜晚可能会有所不同，如果赛普苏没有用长长的狗鞭向后打在他的眼睛上给他眩目一击的话。当巫医在小路中央痛苦地摇晃时，希契科克，急着要赶上她，撞向了他。就这样，这个原始的空头理论家回到首领的小屋时，他的智慧增长了很多，就白种男人拳头的效力而言。因此，那时在委员会里演说时，那时那刻，他对所有白人感到很是愤怒。","Hitchcock called to Sipsu to pull out.At her shrill “Chook!” the maddened brutes shot straight ahead, and the sled, bounding mightily, just missed unseating her.The powers were evidently angry with the witch doctor, for at this moment they plunged him upon the trail.The lead-dog fouled his snowshoes and tripped him up, and the nine succeeding dogs trod him under foot and the sled bumped over him.But he was quick to his feet, and the night might have turned out differently had not Sipsu struck backward with the long dog-whip and smitten him a blinding blow across the eyes.Hitchcock, hurrying to overtake her, collided against him as he swayed with pain in the middle of the trail.Thus it was, when this primitive theologian got back to the chief’s lodge, that his wisdom had been increased in so far as concerns the efficacy of the white man’s fist.So, when he orated then and there in the council, he was wroth against all white men."
"“滚出来，你们这些浪子！滚出来！在你穿上鞋袜之前食物就准备好了！”","“Tumble out, you loafers!Tumble out!Grub’ll be ready before you get into your footgear!”"
"戴夫·沃茨扔掉熊皮，坐起来，打了个哈欠。","Dave Wertz threw off the bearskin, sat up, and yawned."
"霍斯舒展了一下身子，发现胳膊上一块肌肉僵痛，便懒散地揉搓起来。“想知道希契科克昨晚在哪儿睡的吗？”他问道，伸手去取他的鹿皮鞋。它们冻僵了，他穿着袜子小心翼翼地走到火焰旁给它们解冻。“他的离开对我们来说是福气，”他补充说，“尽管他是一个强有力的好工人。”","Hawes stretched, discovered a lame muscle in his arm, and rubbed it sleepily.“Wonder where Hitchcock bunked last night?” he queried, reaching for his moccasins.They were stiff, and he walked gingerly in his socks to the fire to thaw them out.“It’s a blessing he’s gone,” he added, “though he was a mighty good worker.”"
"“是的。太专横了。那是他的不幸。对赛普苏来说太糟了。认为他很关心她？”","“Yep.Too masterful.That was his trouble.Too bad for Sipsu.Think he cared for her much?”"
"“我不这样认为。仅仅是原则问题。仅此而已。他认为那是不对的——而且，当然，那不对——但我们没有理由介入，在我们的时代到来之前为不和忙来忙去。”","“Don’t think so.Just principle.That’s all.He thought it wasn’t right—and, of course, it wasn’t,—but that was no reason for us to interfere and get hustled over the divide before our time.”"
"“原则就是原则，就它本身来说是好的，但当你去阿拉斯加时，那最好留在家里。嗯？”","“Principle is principle, and it’s good in its place, but it’s best left to home when you go to Alaska. Eh?”"
"沃茨加入了他的伙伴，两个人都正忙着软化他们冻僵的鹿皮鞋。“认为我们应该帮忙吗？”","Wertz had joined his mate, and both were working pliability into their frozen moccasins.“Think we ought to have taken a hand?”"
"西格蒙德摇摇头。他非常忙。巧克力色的水沫从咖啡壶里升起，咸肉需要翻面了。况且，他正想着那个笑起来眼睛如夏日海洋的女孩呢，他温柔地哼唱着。","Sigmund shook his head.He was very busy.A scud of chocolate-colored foam was rising in the coffee-pot, and the bacon needed turning.Also, he was thinking about the girl with laughing eyes like summer seas, and he was humming softly."
"他的伙伴对着彼此笑了起来，停止了谈话。虽然已经过了七点，离天亮还有三个小时呢。北极光滑过天空，营地是沉沉黑夜中一片光的绿洲。在这片光亮中，三个人的轮廓非常清晰。寂静增加了勇气，西格蒙德提高嗓音唱起了老歌最后一节——","His mates chuckled to each other and ceased talking.Though it was past seven, daybreak was still three hours distant.The aurora borealis had passed out of the sky, and the camp was an oasis of light in the midst of deep darkness.And in this light the forms of the three men were sharply defined.Emboldened by the silence, Sigmund raised his voice and opened the last stanza of the old song:—"
"“一年以后，一年以后，当葡萄成熟时——”","“In a year, in a year, when the grapes are ripe—”"
"这时夜晚突然被一连串齐发的步枪咔嗒声劈开了。霍斯叹了口气，努力想挺直身体，却倒下了。沃茨低垂着头用肘部前移。他有点儿哽住了，一种深色液体从他嘴里流出。而西格蒙德，那个金黄色头发的人，他的喉咙咯咯地唱着歌，扬起胳膊砸在火焰上。","Then the night was split with a rattling volley of rifle-shots.Hawes sighed, made an effort to straighten himself, and collapsed.Wertz went over on an elbow with drooping head.He choked a little, and a dark stream flowed from his mouth.And Sigmund, the Golden-Haired, his throat a-gurgle with the song, threw up his arms and pitched across the fire."
"巫医的眼睛完全看不见了，他的脾气不太好，因为他就沃茨步枪的所有权跟首领吵了起来，而且他拿的豆子比分给他的那部分要多。巫医的眼睛完全看不见了，他的脾气不太好，因为他就沃茨步枪的所有权跟首领吵了起来，而且他拿的豆子比分给他的那部分要多。最后，他试图杀死女孩送给西格蒙德的那条狗，但那条狗逃跑了，而他掉进了矿井，肩膀撞在水桶上脱臼了。营地被抢劫完毕，他们回到各自的小屋，女人们举行了盛大的庆祝。此外，一群驼鹿在南部分水岭处走散了，死在了猎人面前，因此巫医得到了更大的荣誉，人们背后议论说他在委员会里和众神说过话。","The witch doctor’s eyes were well blackened, and his temper none of the best; for he quarrelled with the chief over the possession of Wertz’s rifle, and took more than his share of the part-sack of beans.Also he appropriated the bearskin, and caused grumbling among the tribesmen.And finally, he tried to kill Sigmund’s dog, which the girl had given him, but the dog ran away, while he fell into the shaft and dislocated his shoulder on the bucket.When the camp was well looted they went back to their own lodges, and there was a great rejoicing among the women.Further, a band of moose strayed over the south divide and fell before the hunters, so the witch doctor attained yet greater honor, and the people whispered among themselves that he spoke in council with the gods."
"但后来，当所有都消失后，牧羊犬爬回了废弃的营地，一整夜和整个白天都在为那些死去的人恸哭。之后它消失了，但没过几年，印第安猎人注意到大灰狼品种的一个变化，出现了以前的狼没有的亮色横杠和杂色标记。","But later, when all were gone, the shepherd dog crept back to the deserted camp, and all the night long and a day it wailed the dead.After that it disappeared, though the years were not many before the Indian hunters noted a change in the breed of timber wolves, and there were dashes of bright color and variegated markings such as no wolf bore before."
