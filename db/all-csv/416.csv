"The Stolen White Elephant","被偷的白象"
"by Mark Twain","作者：马克·吐温"
"I","一"
"[Left out of A Tramp Abroad, because it was feared that some of the particulars had been exaggerated, and that others were not true.","[略去了一段在国外流浪的经历，这是因为担心有些细节会被认为是夸张了的，或者另外细节是子虚乌有的。"
"Before these suspicions had been proven groundless, the book had gone to press.","在这些疑点未被证实之前，这本书就被送去出版了。"
"—M. T.]","——马克·吐温]"
"The following curious history was related to me by a chance railway acquaintance.","下面这个奇特的故事是一个在火车上偶然认识的人讲给我听的。"
"He was a gentleman more than seventy years of age, and his thoroughly good and gentle face and earnest and sincere manner imprinted the unmistakable stamp of truth upon every statement which fell from his lips.","他是一位年过七旬的绅士。他看上去面善得很，温文尔雅的脸庞以及认真诚恳的态度使得所有从他嘴里说出来的话都让人深信不疑。"
"He said:","他说："
"You know in what reverence the royal white elephant of Siam is held by the people of that country.","你知道在暹罗，皇室的白象是何等地受国民发尊崇吗？"
"You know it is sacred to kings, only kings may possess it, and that it is, indeed, in a measure even superior to kings, since it receives not merely honor but worship.","它对国王们来说是很神圣的，只有国王才可能会拥有它。因为它不仅仅受到尊敬，还受到敬仰，所以在一定程度上来说，它确实甚至比国王的地位还要高。"
"Very well; five years ago, when the troubles concerning the frontier line arose between Great Britain and Siam, it was presently manifest that Siam had been in the wrong.","好啦，话说那是五年前，大不列颠和暹罗起了边界纠纷，不久就证实是暹罗这一方有错，应承担责任。"
"Therefore every reparation was quickly made, and the British representative stated that he was satisfied and the past should be forgotten.","于是很快全部的赔偿手续都已办妥。英国代表表示他很满意，过去的一切都将一笔勾销。"
"This greatly relieved the King of Siam, and partly as a token of gratitude, partly also, perhaps, to wipe out any little remaining vestige of unpleasantness which England might feel toward him, he wished to send the Queen a present—the sole sure way of propitiating an enemy, according to Oriental ideas.","这让暹罗国王大大地松了一口气，一方面是为了表示感激，另一方面或许是为了消除英国对他残余的哪怕一点点的不愉快，他想送给英国女王一件礼物——按照东方人的观念，这是与敌人冰释前嫌唯一可靠的办法。"
"This present ought not only to be a royal one, but transcendently royal.","这件礼物不仅应当高贵，而且还应当特别高贵。"
"Wherefore, what offering could be so meet as that of a white elephant?","因此，还有什么比白象更为适合的呢？"
"My position in the Indian civil service was such that I was deemed peculiarly worthy of the honor of conveying the present to her Majesty.","我当时在印度的行政部门任职，所以大家认为我特别配得上把这个礼物送到女王陛下手上的荣誉。"
"A ship was fitted out for me and my servants and the officers and attendants of the elephant, and in due time I arrived in New York harbor and placed my royal charge in admirable quarters in Jersey City.","出行的船为我准备好了，随行的仆人、士兵以及为白象服务的侍从们也为我安排了。我按时抵达了纽约港，并且把这个皇家委托物安置在了泽西城中一个极好的地方。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　"
"It was necessary to remain awhile in order to recruit the animal’s health before resuming the voyage.","在再次起航之前，为了让白象恢复健康，停下来休整一段时间是很有必要的。"
"All went well during a fortnight—then my calamities began.","两周过去了，一切情况良好——然后我的灾难就开始了。"
"The white elephant was stolen!","这头白象被偷走了！"
"I was called up at dead of night and informed of this fearful misfortune.","我在深更半夜被人叫醒，然后就得知了这个可怕的噩耗。"
"For some moments I was beside myself with terror and anxiety; I was helpless.","有那么个一时半会儿，我恐惧焦躁到了极点，我感到很无助。"
"Then I grew calmer and collected my faculties.","后来我渐渐冷静下来，开始绞尽脑汁地想法子。"
"I soon saw my course—for, indeed, there was but the one course for an intelligent man to pursue.","很快我便想到了一个办法——因为聪明人实际上都只会想到这一个办法。"
"Late as it was, I flew to New York and got a policeman to conduct me to the headquarters of the detective force.","尽管已经很晚了，但是我还是搭飞机去了纽约，找到一个警察，让他带我去侦查队的总部。"
"Fortunately I arrived in time, though the chief of the force, the celebrated Inspector Blunt was just on the point of leaving for his home.","幸运的是，我到得很及时。当时侦察队的头领，也就是大名鼎鼎的督察长布伦特先生正打算回家。"
"He was a man of middle size and compact frame, and when he was thinking deeply he had a way of kniting his brows and tapping his forehead reflectively with his finger, which impressed you at once with the conviction that you stood in the presence of a person of no common order.","他身材中等，体格结实。陷入沉思的时候，他会不自觉地皱起眉头，还用手指轻敲前额。那动作让人立马就觉得，站在面前的这位绝对不是等闲之辈。"
"The very sight of him gave me confidence and made me hopeful.","一见到他，我就有了信心，感觉到了希望。"
"I stated my errand.","我说出了此行的使命。"
"It did not flurry him in the least; it had no more visible effect upon his iron self-possession than if I had told him somebody had stolen my dog.","他却丝毫不慌张，就像现在我告诉他的是我的狗被偷了那般泰然自若，丝毫不受影响。"
"He motioned me to a seat, and said, calmly:","他示意让我坐下，然后很镇定地说："
"“Allow me to think a moment, please.”","“请允许我思考一会儿。”"
"So saying, he sat down at his office table and leaned his head upon his hand.","说着，他就在自己的办公桌旁边坐了下来，用一只手托起脑袋。"
"Several clerks were at work at the other end of the room; the scratching of their pens was all the sound I heard during the next six or seven minutes.","房间的另一头，有几个职员在那里工作。在接下来的六七分钟里，我只听到了他们笔头划出的沙沙声。"
"Meantime the inspector sat there, buried in thought.","这期间，那位督察长就一直坐在那里，陷入沉思之中。"
"Finally he raised his head, and there was that in the firm lines of his face which showed me that his brain had done its work and his plan was made.","终于他抬起了头，脸上的坚定神情告诉我，他已经思考完毕，并且想好了计划。"
"Said he—and his voice was low and impressive:","他说——声音低沉而威严："
"“This is no ordinary case.","“这不是件普通的案子。"
"Every step must be warily taken; each step must be made sure before the next is ventured.","每一步都必须要小心谨慎，在冒险走下一步之前，每一步都一定要做到有把握。"
"And secrecy must be observed—secrecy profound and absolute.","同时要注意保密——要彻底、绝对保密。"
"Speak to no one about the matter, not even the reporters.","不要对任何人提起此事，就算是记者也不行。"
"I will take care of them; I will see that they get only what it may suit my ends to let them know.”","我来招呼他们，我保证，他们只会得到符合我目的的信息。”"
"He touched a bell; a youth appeared.","他按了一下铃，一个年轻人就出现了。"
"“Alaric, tell the reporters to remain for the present.”","“阿拉里克，去叫那些记者们暂时先留下。”"
"The boy retired.","那个年轻人就出去了。"
"“Now let us proceed to business—and systematically.","“现在我们就进入正题吧——要很系统地谈。"
"Nothing can be accomplished in this trade of mine without strict and minute method.”","干我们这行的，如果不严格细致地去处理事情，那么肯定是什么也办不成的。”"
"He took a pen and some paper.","他拿出一支笔和一些纸。"
"“Now—name of the elephant?”","“那么——这头象叫什么？”"
"“Hassan Ben Ali Ben Selim Abdallah Mohammed Moist Alhammal Jamsetjejeebhoy Dhuleep Sultan Ebu Bhudpoor.”","“哈桑·本·阿里·本·塞利姆·阿布达拉·穆罕默德·莫伊兹·阿尔罕穆尔·贾母舍杰吉布荷伊·杜利普·苏丹·埃布·布德普尔。”"
"“Very well.","“很好。"
"Given name?”","常用名字呢？”"
"“Jumbo.”","“金宝。”"
"“Very well.","“很好。"
"Place of birth?”","出生地？”"
"“The capital city of Siam.”","“暹罗的首都。”"
"“Parents living?”","“双亲还在吗？”"
"“No—dead.”","“不在——都死了。”"
"“Had they any other issue besides this one?”","“除了这头，它们还生过别的象没？”"
"“None.","“没有。"
"He was an only child.”","它是独生子。”"
"“Very well.","“很好。"
"These matters are sufficient under that head.","在这个部分，有这几点就足够了。"
"Now please describe the elephant, and leave out no particular, however insignificant—that is, insignificant from your point of view.","现在就请你跟我具体说说这头象吧，不要漏掉任何一个细节，不管那个细节多么微小——这么说吧，微小那是你所认为的。"
"To me in my profession there are no insignificant particulars; they do not exist.”","对于干我们这行的来说，没有微不足道的细节，那根本不存在。”"
"I described he wrote.","于是，我说他写。"
"When I was done, he said:","等我描述完毕，他说："
"“Now listen.","“听着。"
"If I have made any mistakes, correct me.”","如果我记错了一些地方，请帮我更正。”"
"He read as follows:","他念了如下的记录："
"“Height, 19 feet; length from apex of forehead insertion of tail, 26 feet; length of trunk, 16 feet; length of tail, 6 feet; total length, including trunk, and tail, 48 feet; length of tusks, 9 feet; ears keeping with these dimensions; footprint resembles the mark left when one up-ends a barrel in the snow; the color of the elephant, a dull white; has a hole the size of a plate in each ear for the insertion of jewelry and possesses the habit in a remarkable degree of squirting water upon spectators and of maltreating with his trunk not only such persons as he is acquainted with, but even entire strangers; limps slightly with his right hind leg, and has a small scar in his left armpit caused by a former boil; had on, when stolen, a castle containing seats for fifteen persons, and a gold-cloth saddle-blanket the size of an ordinary carpet.”","“高，十九英尺；从额尖到尾部的着生处，长二十六英尺；鼻长，十六英尺；尾长，六英尺；总长，包括鼻子、尾巴，四十八英尺；牙长，九英尺；耳朵与这些尺寸相称；脚印跟桶在雪地上印下的痕迹很相似；体色，暗白；每个耳朵上都有个碟子大小的耳洞，那是用来戴首饰的；有向旁人喷水的嗜好，总是用它的鼻子粗暴地耍弄人，不只是熟人，就连完全陌生的人也不放过；右后腿稍微有点儿跛，左腋窝里有个因烫伤留下的小伤疤；被偷时背上背着个可坐十五人的塔楼，身上披着一块由金布织成的普通地毯大小的鞍毯。”"
"There were no mistakes.","没有一点儿错误。"
"The inspector touched the bell, handed the description to Alaric, and said:","然后这位督察长又按了一下铃，把这张记录交给了阿拉里克，说："
"“Have fifty thousand copies of this printed at once and mailed to every detective office and pawnbroker’s shop on the continent.”","“马上去把这个复印五万份，然后邮寄给全美洲所有的警探机关和典当铺。”"
"Alaric retired.","阿拉里克出去了。"
"“There—so far, so good.","“那么——迄今为止，一切都挺好的。"
"Next, I must have a photograph of the property.”","然后，我还得要一张那家伙的照片。”"
"I gave him one.","我给了他一张。"
"He examined it critically, and said:","他挑剔地看着照片，说："
"“It must do, since we can do no better; but he has his trunk curled up and tucked into his mouth.","“也只能用这张了，因为我们找不到更好的了。可是它把鼻子卷起来，塞进了嘴里。"
"That is unfortunate, and is calculated to mislead, for of course he does not usually have it in that position.”","这样效果很不好，会误导大家的，因为它平常肯定不是这样的。”"
"He touched his bell.","他又按了一下铃。"
"“Alaric, have fifty thousand copies of this photograph made the first thing in the morning, and mail them with the descriptive circulars.”","“阿拉里克，明天早上，第一件事就是把这张照片复印五万份，然后连同那份记述文件一并寄出去。”"
"Alaric retired to execute his orders.","阿拉里克退出去执行命令去了。"
"The inspector said:","这位督察长接着说："
"“It will be necessary to offer a reward, of course.","“当然，设立悬赏金也是很有必要的。"
"Now as to the amount?”","那么数目多少才合适呢？”"
"“What sum would you suggest?”","“你觉得呢？”"
"“To begin with, I should say—well, twenty-five thousand dollars.","“一开始，我认为大概——唔，要两万五千美元。"
"It is an intricate and difficult business; there are a thousand avenues of escape and opportunities of concealment.","这是件复杂又难办的案子，有太多逃跑的路线和藏匿的机会。"
"These thieves have friends and pals everywhere—”","这些盗贼到处都有朋友和同伙——”"
"“Bless me, do you know who they are?”","“天啊，你知道他们都是哪些人吗？”"
"The wary face, practised in concealing the thoughts and feelings within, gave me no token, nor yet the replying words, so quietly uttered:","他那张惯于隐藏自己想法和感觉的脸很是谨慎，没有给我任何暗示，也没有任何回应之词，他只是很平静地说："
"“Never mind about that.","“你先别管这些。"
"I may, and I may not.","我可能知道，也可能不知道。"
"We generally gather a pretty shrewd inkling of who our man is by the manner of his work and the size of the game he goes after.","我们通常都会根据盗贼的作案手段以及他所弄到手的东西大小，来搜集一些相当微妙的蛛丝马迹，从而推断出此人是谁。"
"We are not dealing with a pickpocket or a hall thief now, make up your mind to that.","我们现在不是在抓一个扒手或是入室盗窃的小偷，请你弄清楚这一点。"
"This property was not ‘lifted’ by a novice.","那个宝贝可不是被一个新手给弄走的。"
"But, as I was saying, considering the amount of travel which will have to be done, and the diligence with which the thieves will cover up their traces as they move along, twenty-five thousand may be too small a sum to offer, yet I think it worth while to start with that.”","但是正如我说过的，考虑到这次行动中要走很多路程，同时盗贼们还会一路掩藏他们的行踪，所以两万五千美元这个数目可能太少了。然而我觉得，我们最开始是可以开这个价的。”"
"So we determined upon that figure as a beginning.","于是我们就决定以这个数目起价作为悬赏金。"
"Then this man, whom nothing escaped which could by any possibility be made to serve as a clue, said:","接着，这个不放过一切可能线索的人说："
"“There are cases in detective history to show that criminals have been detected through peculiarities, in their appetites.","“在侦查史上有过很多这样的案例，就是通过罪犯们在饮食方面的嗜好抓到他们。"
"Now, what does this elephant eat, and how much?”","对了，这头大象平常都吃些什么，一次要吃多少？”"
"“Well, as to what he eats—he will eat anything.","“唔，至于它吃什么——它什么都吃。"
"He will eat a man, he will eat a Bible—he will eat anything between a man and a Bible.”","它吃人，它还吃《圣经》——处于人与《圣经》之间的所有东西它都吃。”"
"“Good very good, indeed, but too general.","“好，很好，不过这个范围确实太宽泛了。"
"Details are necessary—details are the only valuable things in our trade.","有必要说些具体的——具体的东西才是我们这个行当中唯一有价值的东西。"
"Very well—as to men.","这样吧——就拿人来说吧。"
"At one meal—or, if you prefer, during one day—how man men will he eat, if fresh?”","一顿饭——或者，你更愿意说一天——它可以吃几个人，如果是新鲜的话？”"
"“He would not care whether they were fresh or not; at a single meal he would eat five ordinary men.”","“它才不在乎那是不是新鲜的，它一顿要吃五个普通人。”"
"“Very good; five men; we will put that down.","“很好，五个人，这个要记下来。"
"What nationalities would he prefer?”","它更喜欢吃哪个国家的人呢？”"
"“He is indifferent about nationalities.","“它对国籍没有什么要求。"
"He prefers acquaintances, but is not prejudiced against strangers.”","它更喜欢吃熟悉的人，但也不排斥陌生人。”"
"“Very good.","“很好。"
"Now, as to Bibles.","那么，说到《圣经》。"
"How many Bibles would he eat at a meal?”","它一顿会吃掉多少本呢？”"
"“He would eat an entire edition.”","“它能吃掉一整个版本。”"
"“It is hardly succinct enough.","“你说的不够简洁。"
"Do you mean the ordinary octavo, or the family illustrated?”","你是指普通的八开本呢，还是家庭用有插图的那种啊？”"
"“I think he would be indifferent to illustrations that is, I think he would not value illustrations above simple letterpress.”","“我想它不会在意那上面的插图。也就是说，我觉得比起简单的正文，它不会更看重那些插图。”"
"“No, you do not get my idea.","“不是，你没有听懂我的意思。"
"I refer to bulk.","我是指体积。"
"The ordinary octavo Bible weighs about two pound; and a half, while the great quarto with the illustrations weighs ten or twelve.","普通八开本的那种大约重两磅半，而那种有插图的大四开本重十磅或十二磅。"
"How many Dore Bibles would he eat at a meal?”","它一顿要吃多少本多尔插图版的《圣经》呢？”"
"“If you knew this elephant, you could not ask.","“如果你见识过这头象，你就不会这么问了。"
"He would take what they had.”","它是有多少就吃多少。”"
"“Well, put it in dollars and cents, then.","“哦，那就折合成钱算吧。"
"We must get at it somehow.","我们总得设法把它搞清楚。"
"The Dore costs a hundred dollars a copy, Russia leather, beveled.”","多尔插图版的《圣经》每册要一百美元——用俄罗斯皮革装订、斜书角的那种。”"
"“He would require about fifty thousand dollars worth—say an edition of five hundred copies.”","“那它大概要吃价值五万美元的书才够——如果说是那种一个版本有五百册的。”"
"“Now that is more exact.","“这就准确多了。"
"I will put that down.","我要记下来。"
"Very well; he likes men and Bibles; so far, so good.","很好，它喜欢吃人和《圣经》。到现在为止，一切情况都挺好的。"
"What else will he eat?","它还吃别的什么吗？"
"I want particulars.”","我想知道细节。”"
"“He will leave Bibles to eat bricks, he will leave bricks to eat bottles, he will leave bottles to eat clothing, he will leave clothing to eat cats, he will leave cats to eat oysters, he will leave oysters to eat ham, he will leave ham to eat sugar, he will leave sugar to eat pie, he will leave pie to eat potatoes, he will leave potatoes to eat bran; he will leave bran to eat hay, he will leave hay to eat oats, he will leave oats to eat rice, for he was mainly raised on it.","“它会丢下《圣经》去吃砖块，会丢下砖块去吃瓶子，会丢下瓶子去吃衣物，会丢下衣物去吃猫，会丢下猫去吃牡蛎，会丢下牡蛎去吃火腿，会丢下火腿去吃糖，会丢下糖去吃馅饼，会丢下馅饼去吃土豆，会丢下土豆去吃麸皮，会丢下麸皮去吃干草，会丢下干草去吃燕麦，会丢下燕麦去吃米饭，因为它主要就是靠米饭养大的。"
"There is nothing whatever that he will not eat but European butter, and he would eat that if he could taste it.”","没有什么是它不吃的，除了欧洲的黄油，但是如果它能尝一下那东西的话，它也会吃的。”"
"“Very good.","“很好。"
"General quantity at a meal—say about—”","那它吃一顿的总食量呢——说个大概吧——”"
"“Well, anywhere from a quarter to half a ton.”","“唔，大约在四分之一吨到半吨之间。”"
"“And he drinks—”","“它喝的是——”"
"“Everything that is fluid.","“所有是液体的东西。"
"Milk, water, whisky, molasses, castor oil, camphene, carbolic acid—it is no use to go into particulars; whatever fluid occurs to you set it down.","牛奶、水、威士忌、糖浆、蓖麻油、樟脑油、石炭酸——真的没必要这样细数下去"
"，你就记下所有你能想到的是液体的东西吧。"
"He will drink anything that is fluid, except European coffee.”","除了欧式咖啡，它真是会喝任何是液体的东西。”"
"“Very good.","“很好。"
"As to quantity?”","那么总量呢？”"
"“Put it down five to fifteen barrels—his thirst varies; his other appetites do not.”","“你就写五到十五桶吧——它口渴时的饮量时有变化，而在其他胃口方面是不变的。”　"
"“These things are unusual.","“这些都很不寻常。"
"They ought to furnish quite good clues toward tracing him.”","它们应该可以为追查这头大象提供很好的线索。”"
"He touched the bell.","他又按了一下铃。"
"“Alaric; summon Captain Burns.”","“阿拉里克，去把伯恩斯队长叫来。”"
"Burns appeared.","然后伯恩斯队长就来了。"
"Inspector Blunt unfolded the whole matter to him, detail by detail.","接着布伦特督察长很详细地跟他说明了这整件事，没有漏过任何一个细节。"
"Then he said in the clear, decisive tones of a man whose plans are clearly defined in his head and who is accustomed to command:","这个人已经在头脑里清楚地想好了计划，而且他是个习惯于下命令的人。然后他以明确、坚定的语气说："
"“Captain Burns, detail Detectives Jones, Davis, Halsey, Bates, and Hackett to shadow the elephant.”","“伯恩斯队长派琼斯、戴维斯、哈尔西、贝茨和哈克特这几位警探去追踪这头象。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Detail Detectives Moses, Dakin, Murphy, Rogers, Tupper, Higgins, and Bartholomew to shadow the thieves.”","“派警探摩西、戴金、墨菲、罗杰斯、塔珀、希金斯和巴塞洛缪去追捕这些盗贼。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Place a strong guard—A guard of thirty picked men, with a relief of thirty—over the place from whence the elephant was stolen, to keep strict watch there night and day, and allow none to approach—except reporters—without written authority from me.”","“派一支强大的护卫队——要三十个精挑细选的人，还要安排三十个人去换班——日夜坚守在大象被偷的地方，没我的手谕——除了记者——任何人不得靠近。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Place detectives in plain clothes in the railway; steamship, and ferry depots, and upon all roadways leading out of Jersey City, with orders to search all suspicious persons.”","“在火车上、轮船上、渡口的候船室以及所有通往泽西城外面的道路上，给我安排一些便衣警察，命令他们要搜查所有可疑的人。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Furnish all these men with photograph and accompanying description of the elephant, and instruct them to search all trains and outgoing ferryboats and other vessels.”","“给所有这些人都发一张大象的照片和所附的说明材料，命令他们要搜索所有的火车和外出渡船以及其他船只。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“If the elephant should be found, let him be seized, and the information forwarded to me by telegraph.”","“如果找到这头大象了，要捆住它，然后发电报告诉我这个消息。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Let me be informed at once if any clues should be found footprints of the animal, or anything of that kind.”","“如果找到任何一点儿线索，显示它的足迹或者类似足迹，也一定要马上报告给我。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Get an order commanding the harbor police to patrol the frontages vigilantly.”","“命令下去，让港口警察要注意巡视临街地界，要保持警惕。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Despatch detectives in plain clothes over all the railways, north as far as Canada, west as far as Ohio, south as far as Washington.”","“火速派遣便衣警探赶往所有的铁道站，往北去的最远要到加拿大，往西去的最远要到俄亥俄，往南去的最远要到华盛顿。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Place experts in all the telegraph offices to listen in to all messages; and let them require that all cipher despatches be interpreted to them.”","“派些专家到所有的电报局去监听一切信息，让电报局的人把所有的密码电报都解读给他们听。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Let all these things be done with the utmost’s secrecy—mind, the most impenetrable secrecy.”","“这些事情都要在极度保密的情况下进行——注意，不能透一点儿风。”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是,长官。”"
"“Report to me promptly at the usual hour.”","“平常的时候要准时向我报告。”"
"“Yes, Sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"“Go!”","“现在开始行动！”"
"“Yes, sir.”","“是，长官。”"
"He was gone.","于是他就走了。"
"Inspector Blunt was silent and thoughtful a moment, while the fire in his eye cooled down and faded out.","然后布伦特督察长沉默着思考了一会儿，眼睛里火一般的光芒冷却下来，并渐渐消失了。"
"Then he turned to me and said in a placid voice:","接着他转向我，用一种平和的语气说："
"“I am not given to boasting, it is not my habit; but—we shall find the elephant.”","“我不是个喜欢吹嘘的人，那不是我的习惯。但是——我们一定会找到这头象。”"
"I shook him warmly by the hand and thanked him; and I felt my thanks, too.","我激动地和他握了手，向他表示了感激。而且我真的是从心底里感激他。"
"The more I had seen of the man the more I liked him and the more I admired him and marveled over the mysterious wonders of his profession.","我越看他，就越喜欢他，也越为他和他职业方面不可思议的神秘而叹服。"
"Then we parted for the night, and I went home with a far happier heart than I had carried with me to his office.","然后那晚我们就分开了。我回到家，心里比之前去他办公室的时候要舒坦多了。"
"II","二"
"Next morning it was all in the newspapers, in the minutest detail.","第二天早晨，报纸上就把这件事的一切细节刊登了出来。"
"It even had additions—consisting of Detective This, Detective That, and Detective The Other’s “Theory” as to how the robbery was done, who the robbers were, and whither they had flown with their booty.","内容甚至还有所增加——包括这个警探、那个警探，还有另外某个警探对整个作案过程、作案人员以及他们带着赃物已经逃到何处所作出的推断。"
"There were eleven of these theories, and they covered all the possibilities; and this single fact shows what independent thinkers detectives are.","共有十一种推断，它们涵盖了所有的可能性。单单这一事实就告诉我们，什么才叫具有独立思考能力的警探。"
"No two theories were alike, or even much resembled each other, save in one striking particular, and in that one all the other eleven theories were absolutely agreed.","没有哪两种推断是相同的，甚至连很相似的都没有，但在一个很突出的点上，这十一种推断都完全一致。"
"That was, that although the rear of my building was torn out and the only door remained locked, the elephant had not been removed through the rent, but by some other (undiscovered) outlet.","那就是，尽管那房子的后面被打开了一个口子，唯一的门没被撬开，但是这头象绝不是从那个破洞被弄出去的，一定是从某个别的出口（未被发现）出去的。"
"All agreed that the robbers had made that rent only to mislead the detectives.","所有的人都认为，那些盗贼之所以要弄那个破洞，只是为了误导警探。"
"That never would have occurred to me or to any other layman, perhaps, but it had not deceived the detectives for a moment.","或许，我们这些外行从来都不会想到这一点。但是当警探的，一眼就能识破这个骗局。"
"Thus, what I had supposed was the only thing that had no mystery about it was in fact the very thing I had gone furthest astray in.","就这样，唯一一个我自以为没有什么玄机的地方，实际上就是最让我陷入迷途的地方。"
"The eleven theories all named the supposed robbers, but no two named the same robbers; the total number of suspected persons was thirty-seven.","十一种推断中还都指明了有嫌疑的盗贼，但是没有哪两种说了同一个人。总共有三十七个犯罪嫌疑人。"
"The various newspaper accounts all closed with the most important opinion of all—that of Chief Inspector Blunt.","所有的报道都是以最重要的意见结束的——那就是布伦特督察长的意见。"
"A portion of this statement read as follows:","以下是其中一部分言论："
"The chief knows who the two principals are, namely, “Brick” Daffy and “Red” McFadden.","督察长知道这两位主犯是谁，他们分别是“好汉”达菲和“赤发”麦克法登。"
"Ten days before the robbery was achieved he was already aware that it was to be attempted, and had quietly proceeded to shadow these two noted villains; but unfortunately on the night in question their track was lost, and before it could be found again the bird was flown—that is, the elephant.","在这起盗窃案发生的前十天，他就已经意识到他们有所图谋，并暗中着手去跟踪这两个臭名昭著的恶棍。但遗憾的是，在事发当晚，这两个恶棍就失去了踪影，而且在再次发现他们之前，那家伙——就是这头大象就已经不翼而飞了。"
"Daffy and McFadden are the boldest scoundrels in the profession; the chief has reasons for believing that they are the men who stole the stove out of the detective headquarters on a bitter night last winter—in consequence of which the chief and every detective present were in the hands of the physicians before morning, some with frozen feet, others with frozen fingers, ears, and other members.","达菲和麦克法登是那个行当里最敢冒险的两个恶棍。督察长完全有理由相信，就是这两个人，在去年冬天一个寒风刺骨的晚上，偷走了警察总部里的火炉——结果让他和所有在那里的警探因为冻伤脚、手指、耳朵或其他部位而去就医。"
"When I read the first half of that I was more astonished than ever at the wonderful sagacity of this strange man.","看到前半段的时候，我真为这个奇异的人所拥有的令人惊奇的睿智而感到惊讶至极。"
"He not only saw everything in the present with a clear eye, but even the future could not be hidden from him.","他不仅能清楚地认识到现在所有的一切，而且甚至能够预知未来。"
"I was soon at his office, and said I could not help wishing he had had those men arrested, and so prevented the trouble and loss; but his reply was simple and unanswerable:","我立刻就去了他的办公室，跟他说，我真希望他之前就把那些人拘留了，这样就能防止发生这次的麻烦和损失。但他的回答却是简单而又不可辩驳："
"“It is not our province to prevent crime, but to punish it.","“我们的职责不是阻止犯罪，而是惩罚犯罪。"
"We cannot punish it until it is committed.”","只有当它发生了，我们才能行使职权。”"
"I remarked that the secrecy with which we had begun had been marred by the newspapers; not only all our facts but all our plans and purposes had been revealed; even all the suspected persons had been named; these would doubtless disguise themselves now, or go into hiding.","我说，开始我们说好要保密，现在却全被报纸给曝光了。不仅是这整件事，还有我们的计划和目标都被揭露了，甚至所有的嫌疑人名单都出来了，这些毫无疑问会让那些罪犯乔装打扮或者躲藏起来。"
"“Let them.","“随他们去吧。"
"They will find that when I am ready for them my hand will descend upon them, in their secret places, as unerringly as the hand of fate.","他们会知道，等我准备好抓他们，我会在他们的秘密地点给他们来个突然袭击，就像命运之神的手那样准确地把他们揪出来。"
"As to the newspapers, we must keep in with them.","至于各家报纸，我们得跟它们搞好关系。"
"Fame, reputation, constant public mention—these are the detective’s bread and butter.","名誉、声望以及报纸上经常性的提名表扬——这些是作为警探赖以谋生的东西。"
"He must publish his facts, else he will be supposed to have none; he must publish his theory, for nothing is so strange or striking as a detective’s theory, or brings him so much wonderful respect; we must publish our plans, for these the journals insist upon having, and we could not deny them without offending.","他必须公布他所掌握的事实，否则会被认为一无所知。他也必须公开发表对此作出的推断，因为没有什么比警探的推断更离奇惊人，也没有什么能让他得到公众如此多的尊重。我们也必须公布我们的计划，因为这些是新闻报纸上必须要有的，如果我们拒给，是会得罪人的。"
"We must constantly show the public what we are doing, or they will believe we are doing nothing.","我们还必须经常向公众说明我们正在做的工作，不然他们会觉得我们什么也没干。"
"It is much pleasanter to have a newspaper say, ‘Inspector Blunt’s ingenious and extraordinary theory is as follows,’ than to have it say some harsh thing, or, worse still, some sarcastic one.”","与其让那些报纸说些难听的话，或者甚至是一些挖苦的话，不如让他们说‘布伦特督察长巧妙非凡的推断是如何如何’，这样听起来要愉快得多。”"
"“I see the force of what you say.","“我明白你说这些话的分量。"
"But I noticed that in one part of your remarks in the papers this morning you refused to reveal your opinion upon a certain minor point.”","可是在今天早晨的报纸上，我注意到你的一部分言论，你拒绝对某个次要问题透露意见。”"
"“Yes, we always do that; it has a good effect.","“是的，我们一直是那么做的，那样做效果很好。"
"Besides, I had not formed any opinion on that point, anyway.”","而且不管怎么说，当时我对那个问题还没有形成什么看法。”"
"I deposited a considerable sum of money with the inspector, to meet current expenses, and sat down to wait for news.","我给了那个督察长一大笔钱，以此作为日常开支，然后就坐下来等消息。"
"We were expecting the telegrams to begin to arrive at any moment now.","现在，我们期盼着随时都有电报发过来。"
"Meantime I reread the newspapers and also our descriptive circular, and observed that our twenty-five thousand dollars reward seemed to be offered only to detectives.","期间我重新读了一下报纸和我们的说明传单，注意到似乎我们的那笔两万五千美元悬赏金只是专门奖给警探的。"
"I said I thought it ought to be offered to anybody who would catch the elephant.","我说我觉得它应该用来奖给所有能抓到这头大象的人。"
"The inspector said:","这位督察长就说："
"“It is the detectives who will find the elephant; hence the reward will go to the right place.","“找到这头大象的一定会是警探，因此这笔奖金必然会是用对了地方的。"
"If other people found the animal, it would only be by watching the detectives and taking advantage of clues and indications stolen from them, and that would entitle the detectives to the reward, after all.","就算是其他人找到这头象，那也只是因为他们留心观察了警探们的行动，利用了窥探来的线索和提示，所以这笔奖金终究还是应该奖给警探们。"
"The proper office of a reward is to stimulate the men who deliver up their time and their trained sagacities to this sort of work, and not to confer benefits upon chance citizens who stumble upon a capture without having earned the benefits by their own merits and labors.”","奖金的正当作用是用来激励那些花时间、并凭借训练出来的智慧来做这行工作的人，而不是把这种利益授予那些碰运气的人，他们只是偶然发现了一个捕获物，并不是靠自己的能力和劳动赢得的。”"
"This was reasonable enough, certainly.","这话说得的确合情合理。"
"Now the telegraphic machine in the corner began to click, and the following despatch was the result:","这时角落里的电报机开始咔哒咔哒地响起来，结果就收到了下面的这封急电："
"FLOWER STATION, N. Y., 7.30 A.M.","上午七点半在纽约弗劳尔车站"

"At least, unassisted.”","至少单吃那个是吃不饱的。”"

"Before I could make a comment upon this extraordinary episode, the following despatch carried my thoughts into another and very distressing channel:","我还没来得及对这个特别事件发表意见，接着来的一份急件又让我陷入了悲伤："
"BOLIVIA, N. Y., 12.50.","十二时五十分，纽约，玻利维亚。"
"Elephant arrived here from the south and passed through toward the forest at 11.50, dispersing a funeral on the way, and diminishing the mourners by two.","象由南来，十一时五十分经此通往森林，驱散路上一送葬队，两名送葬者被杀。"
"Citizens fired some small cannon-balls into him, and they fled.","人们朝其开若干炮后逃走。"
"Detective Burke and I arrived ten minutes later, from the north, but mistook some excavations for footprints, and so lost a good deal of time; but at last we struck the right trail and followed it to the woods.","伯克警探和我十分钟后由北抵此。因误将某些洞眼当成象之足迹，故误时良久。然卒获其足迹，遂追随至林中。"
"We then got down on our hands and knees and continued to keep a sharp eye on the track, and so shadowed it into the brush.","后吾等匍匐前行仔细搜寻其足迹，至一灌木林。"
"Burke was in advance.","伯克在前。"
"Unfortunately the animal had stopped to rest; therefore, Burke having his head down, intent upon the track, butted up against the elephant’s hind legs before he was aware of his vicinity.","很不幸，此象已停下歇息,而伯克只顾低头专注于搜寻足迹，头已碰到象后腿，却未注意到自己已在象近旁。"
"Burke instantly arose to his feet, seized the tail, and exclaimed joyfully, “I claim the re—” but got no further, for a single blow of the huge trunk laid the brave fellow’s fragments low in death.","伯克立即站起，抓住象尾，欢呼大叫：“我要去领……”话音未了，即遭象巨鼻猛力一击而粉身碎骨，倒地而死。"
"I fled rearward, and the elephant turned and shadowed me to the edge of the wood, making tremendous speed, and I should inevitably have been lost, but that the remains of the funeral providentially intervened again and diverted his attention.","我向后逃走，象转而对我穷追不舍，直至森林边缘，且速度飞快。我本必死无疑，未料前送葬队又出现，象遂转移注意力，舍我而他追。"
"I have just learned that nothing of that funeral is now left; but this is no loss, for there is abundance of material for another.","现闻该送葬队无一人幸免，然此不足为虑，因尚有众多人可另组织一队。"
"Meantime, the elephant has disappeared again.","此间象又失踪。"
"MULROONEY, Detective.","警探马尔罗尼。"
"We heard no news except from the diligent and confident detectives scattered about New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia—who were all following fresh and encouraging clues—until shortly after 2 P.M., when this telegram came:","后来，我们只从遍布在新泽西州、宾夕法尼亚州、特拉华州和弗吉尼亚州的警探们那里得到了消息。他们勤干而信心十足，尾随着一些振奋人心的新线索在追踪，─直到刚过两点，下面这份电报来了："
"BAXTER CENTER, 2.15.","二时十五分，巴克斯特中心"
"Elephant been here, plastered over with circus-bills, any broke up a revival, striking down and damaging many who were on the point of entering upon a better life.","象曾到此，周身贴满马戏团海报，搅乱一信仰复兴会，数名正准备开始新生之会众死伤。"
"Citizens penned him up and established a guard.","人们囚其于栏内，着人看守。"
"When Detective Brown and I arrived, some time after, we entered inclosure and proceeded to identify elephant by photograph and description.","后布朗警探及吾抵此，遂入栏据照片与说明进行鉴定。"
"All masks tallied exactly except one, which we could not see—the boil-scar under armpit.","所有特征均完全符合，唯难见腋下之烫伤疤。"
"To make sure, Brown crept under to look, and was immediately brained—that is, head crushed and destroyed, though nothing issued from debris.","为确认，布朗匍匐行至象腹下查看，随即脑部遭象重击而破裂，且颅内空无一物。"
"All fled so did elephant, striking right and left with much effect.","众皆逃。象亦逃，左右攻击，死伤无数。"

"This lasted all night.","雾持续了一整夜。"
"The ferry-boats and even the omnibuses had to stop running.","渡船，甚至公共汽车，均被迫停开。"
"III","三"
"Next morning the papers were as full of detective theories as before; they had all our tragic facts in detail also, and a great many more which they had received from their telegraphic correspondents.","第二天早晨，报纸上和先前一样，满版都是警探们的推断。它们还详细刊登了所有不幸的消息以及从电报通讯员那得来的更多消息。"
"Column after column was occupied, a third of its way down, with glaring head-lines, which it made my heart sick to read.","这些消息一个专栏接着一个专栏地刊登，占了版面的三分之一，还配上了醒目的大标题，让我看了心里很不舒服。"
"Their general tone was like this:","这些标题的调子大多是这样的："
"THE WHITE ELEPHANT AT LARGE!","白象仍未捕获！　"
"HE MOVES UPON HIS FATAL MARCH WHOLE VILLAGES DESERTED BY THEIR FRIGHT-STRICKEN OCCUPANTS!","白象所到之处，灾祸迭起！村民受惊逃离，村庄荒芜！"
"PALE TERROR GOES BEFORE HIM, DEATH AND DEVASTATION FOLLOW AFTER!","白色恐怖在前，死亡与荒废随后！"
"AFTER THESE, THE DETECTIVES!","诸般之后，则为警探！"
"BARNS DESTROYED, FACTORIES GUTTED, HARVESTS DEVOURED, PUBLIC ASSEMBLAGES DISPERSED, ACCOMPANIED BY SCENES OF CARNAGE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE!","粮仓被破，工厂被毁，庄稼被吃光，公共集会被驱散，更有无法形容之残杀情景！"
"THEORIES OF THIRTY-FOUR OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED DETECTIVES ON THE FORCES!","警探队三十四位最杰出警探之推断！"
"THEORY OF CHIEF BLUNT!","督察长布伦特之推断！"
"“There!” said Inspector Blunt, almost betrayed into excitement, “this is magnificent!","“你瞧！”布伦特督察长几乎露出激动的神情说，“真是了不起啊！"
"This is the greatest windfall that any detective organization ever had.","这对于任何一个警察机构来说，都是从未有过的意外收获。"
"The fame of it will travel to the ends of the earth, and endure to the end of time, and my name with it.”","这名声将传遍世界各地，流芳千古，我的名字也在其中呢。”"
"But there was no joy for me.","但这于我，却是没什么高兴可言的。"
"I felt as if I had committed all those red crimes, and that the elephant was only my irresponsible agent.","我感觉这些血腥的罪行全是我犯下的，而这头象仅仅是我一个不负责任的代理人而已。"
"And how the list had grown!","受害人的名单增加得是如此之快！"
"In one place he had “interfered with an election and killed five repeaters.”","在一个地方，它“扰乱了一次选举大会，杀死了五名重复投票的选民”。"
"He had followed this act with the destruction of two pool fellows, named O’Donohue and McFlannigan, who had “found a refuge in the home of the oppressed of all lands only the day before, and were in the act of exercising for the first time the noble right of American citizens at the polls, when stricken down by the relentless hand of the Scourge of Siam.”","接着，它又杀死了两个可怜的人，他们是奥多诺霍和麦克弗兰尼刚。这两位“前一天才在这个全世界被压迫之家找到一个庇护所，正要第一次履行美国公民投票的神圣权利，却就在此时死于这个无情的暹罗杀手之手。”"
"In another, he had “found a crazy sensation-preacher preparing his next season’s heroic attacks on the dance, the theater, and other things which can’t strike back, and had stepped on him.”","在另一个地方，它“发现了一个狂热的、善于煽动人群的传教士正准备他下一季对舞蹈、戏剧以及其他无法还击的东西要进行的大胆攻击，便一脚就踩死了他。”"
"And in still another place he had “killed a lightning-rod agent.”","接着又在另一个地方，它“杀害了一个避雷针代理商”。"
"And so the list went on, growing redder and redder, and more and more heartbreaking.","受害者的人数就那样不断地在增加，越来越血腥，越来越令人悲痛欲绝。"
"Sixty persons had been killed, and two hundred and forty wounded.","到最后共有六十人死亡，两百四十人受伤。"
"All the accounts bore just testimony to the activity and devotion of the detectives, and all closed with the remark that “three hundred thousand citizen; and four detectives saw the dread creature, and two of the latter he destroyed.”","而所有这些记录只是证明了警探们的活动以及他们的献身精神。所有的报道都是这样结尾的：三十万市民和四名警探都看到了这个可怕的家伙，而警探中有两个已遇害。"
"I dreaded to hear the telegraphic instrument begin to click again.","我真害怕那个电报机又开始响起来。"
"By and by the messages began to pour in, but I was happily disappointed in they nature.","不久，消息又开始络绎不绝地来了。接到这些，我真是又高兴又失望。"
"It was soon apparent that all trace of the elephant was lost.","很快就弄清楚了，原来象已不知去向。"
"The fog had enabled him to search out a good hiding-place unobserved.","雾的笼罩使它得以寻到一个不被人发觉的绝佳藏匿地。"
"Telegrams from the most absurdly distant points reported that a dim vast mass had been glimpsed there through the fog at such and such an hour, and was “undoubtedly the elephant.”","从一些遥远得荒唐无比的地方来的电报称，有人在某某时间透过大雾，瞥见一庞然大物模糊的影子，那“无疑就是那头大象”。"
"This dim vast mass had been glimpsed in New Haven, in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania, in interior New York, in Brooklyn, and even in the city of New York itself!","这个模糊的庞然大物，曾在纽黑文、新泽西、宾夕法尼亚、纽约州内地、布鲁克林，甚至在纽约市都被人瞥见过！"
"But in all cases the dim vast mass had vanished quickly and left no trace.","但不管是怎样的情况，那个庞然大物都是一闪而过，没有留下任何痕迹。"
"Every detective of the large force scattered over this huge extent of country sent his hourly report, and each and every one of them had a clue, and was shadowing something, and was hot upon the heels of it.","警探大队派往广大地区的每个警探都频繁发来电报，每个人都说自己掌握了线索，都在跟踪某物，步步尾随。"
"But the day passed without other result.","可是一天过去了，没有新的结果出来。"
"The next day the same.","第二天也是一样。"
"The next just the same.","再过一天也还是一样。"
"The newspaper reports began to grow monotonous with facts that amounted to nothing, clues which led to nothing, and theories which had nearly exhausted the elements which surprise and delight and dazzle.","报纸开始报道一些令人乏味、毫无意义的事实，各种线索也都没追查出什么结果，各种推断也几乎只是挖空心思想出来让人惊奇、高兴和感到茫然的东西。"
"By advice of the inspector I doubled the reward.","在督察长的建议下，我把悬赏金抬高了一倍。"
"Four more dull days followed.","接下来又是枯燥的四天。"
"Then came a bitter blow to the poor, hard-working detectives—the journalists declined to print their theories, and coldly said, “Give us a rest.”","然后，这些可怜的、辛苦工作的警探们就迎来了一次狠狠的打击——记者们拒绝刊登他们的推断，还冷冷地说：“给我们一点儿时间休息吧。”"
"Two weeks after the elephant’s disappearance I raised the reward to seventy-five thousand dollars by the inspector’s advice.","在大象消失两周后，我依照督察长的建议把奖金抬高到了七万五千美元。"
"It was a great sum, but I felt that I would rather sacrifice my whole private fortune than lose my credit with my government.","这是一大笔钱。但是我宁可搭上我所有的个人财产，也不愿失去我的政府对我的信任。"
"Now that the detectives were in adversity, the newspapers turned upon them, and began to fling the most stinging sarcasms at them.","现在警探们的工作正处于艰难时期，于是报纸就转而开始攻击他们，拿最难听的话来讽刺他们。"
"This gave the minstrels an idea, and they dressed themselves as detectives and hunted the elephant on the stage in the most extravagant way.","这一切给了滑稽说唱团的演员们“灵感”，他们扮演成警探，在舞台上上演最夸张的寻象经历。"
"The caricaturists made pictures of detectives scanning the country with spy-glasses, while the elephant, at their backs, stole apples out of their pockets.","漫画家们也以此画了一些漫画，画上面的警探们拿着间谍眼镜，在乡间仔细搜寻着大象，而大象却在他们的背后从他们的袋子里偷苹果吃。"
"And they made all sorts of ridiculous pictures of the detective badge—you have seen that badge printed in gold on the back of detective novels, no doubt it is a wide-staring eye, with the legend, “WE NEVER SLEEP.”","他们还将警探们佩戴的徽章画成各种荒谬可笑的漫画——就是那种你见过的印在侦探小说封底的金色徽章，毫无疑问，那上面是一只睁大的眼睛，还配有“我们时刻警醒”的说明。"
"When detectives called for a drink, the would-be facetious barkeeper resurrected an obsolete form of expression and said, “Will you have an eye-opener?”","碰上警探们去酒店喝酒，那个自命滑稽的酒店主就会引用一句早已过时的话说：“你们要不要来杯开眼酒啊？”"
"All the air was thick with sarcasms.","那神情完全充满了讽刺。"
"But there was one man who moved calm, untouched, unaffected, through it all.","但有一个人对这所有的情况依然保持冷静、淡定、不受影响。"
"It was that heart of oak, the chief inspector.","他就是勇敢坚强的督察长。"
"His brave eye never drooped, his serene confidence never wavered.","他那双充满无畏的眼睛永远不会下垂，他那坚定的信心永远不会动摇。"
"He always said:","他一直说："
"“Let them rail on; he laughs best who laughs last.”","“让他们嘲笑吧，谁笑到最后，谁才笑得最好。”"
"My admiration for the man grew into a species of worship.","于是我对他的敬佩上升成了一种崇拜。"
"I was at his side always.","我一直和他呆在一起。"
"His office had become an unpleasant place to me, and now became daily more and more so.","他的办公室已经成了一个让我厌恶的地方，日复一日，现在真的越来越讨厌。"
"Yet if he could endure it I meant to do so also—at least, as long as I could.","然而如果他能忍受得了，我就也得忍下去——至少要做到能忍多久是多久。"
"So I came regularly, and stayed—the only outsider who seemed to be capable of it.","所以我还是定期去他那里，然后留在那里——我似乎是唯一一个可以忍受得了这种局面的局外人。"
"Everybody wondered how I could; and often it seemed to me that I must desert, but at such times I looked into that calm and apparently unconscious face, and held my ground.","每个人都很好奇我是怎么忍受得了的。似乎很多时候我都想逃开，但当我看到那张冷静并且明显不为所动的脸庞时，我就又会坚定自己的立场。"
"About three weeks after the elephant’s disappearance I was about to say, one morning, that I should have to strike my colors and retire, when the great detective arrested the thought by proposing one more superb and masterly move.","大象失踪大约三周后的一天早晨，我正打算偃旗息鼓，撤销搜寻大象的计划时，这位了不起的警探却提出了一个极好的、巧妙的行动计划，于是我的打算就此作罢。"
"This was to compromise with the robbers.","这个计划就是向窃贼妥协。"
"The fertility of this man’s invention exceeded anything I have ever seen, and I have had a wide intercourse with the world’s finest minds.","此人是如此聪明，主意多得无人能及，虽然我曾经和世界上的顶尖人物也有过广泛的接触，但那些人确实都无法望其项背。"
"He said he was confident he could compromise for one hundred thousand dollars and recover the elephant.","他说他有把握可以用十万美元向对方妥协从而找回大象。"
"I said I believed I could scrape the amount together, but what would become of the poor detectives who had worked so faithfully?","我说我相信我可以凑齐这笔钱，但是那些可怜的、卖力工作的警探们该怎么办呢？"
"He said:","他说："
"“In compromises they always get half.”","“如果按妥协的办法来，他们通常会得到一半的好处。”"
"This removed my only objection.","这就消除了我唯一的异议。"
"So the inspector wrote two notes, in this form:","于是，这位督察长就写了两张便条，形式如下："
"DEAR MADAM,—Your husband can make a large sum of money (and be entirely protected from the law) by making an immediate, appointment with me.","亲爱的夫人——只要你的丈夫能立即跟我会面一次，即可得到一大笔钱（并保证完全受到法律保护）。"
"Chief BLUNT.","警探队头领布伦特。"
"He sent one of these by his confidential messenger to the “reputed wife” of Brick Duffy, and the other to the reputed wife of Red McFadden.","他派他的心腹信使将其中一张便条送给了“好汉”达菲所谓的妻子，另一张送给了“赤发”麦克法登所谓的妻子。"
"Within the hour these offensive answers came:","不到一个钟头，便来了如下这些无礼的答复："
"YE OWLD FOOL: brick Duffys bin ded 2 yere.","老蠢蛋：“好汉”达菲已经死了两年了。"
"BRIDGET MAHONEY.","布丽奇特·马奥尼。"
"CHIEF BAT,—Red McFadden is hung and in heving 18 month.","瞎头领——“赤发”麦克法登早在一年半以前就被绞死了。"
"Any Ass but a detective know that.","除了当警探的，任何笨蛋都知道这事。"
"MARY O’HOOLIGAN.","玛丽·奥胡丽甘。"
"“I had long suspected these facts,” said the inspector; “this testimony proves the unerring accuracy of my instinct.”","“我早就料到这些了，”督察长说，“这些事实证明我的直觉是准确无误的。”"
"The moment one resource failed him he was ready with another.","这个办法以失败告终，马上他又想好了一个。"
"He immediately wrote an advertisement for the morning papers, and I kept a copy of it:","他很快写了一则广告去晨报上刊登，我抄了一份下来："
"A.—xWhlv. 242 ht.","阿——星沃尔维。242亨特。"
"Tjnd—fz328wmlg.","特接那得——附兹328哇姆律格。"
"Ozpo,—2 m! 2m!.","奥扎帕奥，——２姆！２姆！"
"M! ogw.","姆！奥格乌。"
"He said that if the thief was alive this would bring him to the usual rendezvous.","他说如果那个盗贼还活着，那么这则广告就会将他带到约会的老地方去。"
"He further explained that the usual rendezvous was a glare where all business affairs between detectives and criminals were conducted.","他还进一步解释说，这个约会的老地方是一直以来警探与罪犯就所有事务展开谈判的地方。"
"This meeting would take place at twelve the next night.","这次会面将于明晚十二点举行。"
"We could do nothing till then, and I lost no time in getting out of the office, and was grateful indeed for the privilege.","在那之前我们无事可做，于是我以最快的速度离开了办公室，心中对自己能有这样的优待很是感激。"
"At eleven the next night I brought one hundred thousand dollars in bank-notes and put them into the chief’s hands, and shortly afterward he took his leave, with the brave old undimmed confidence in his eye.","第二天晚上十一点，我带了十万美元现金，把它交到了督察长手里。不久他就去赴约了，眼里闪耀着往日那勇敢明朗的自信。"
"An almost intolerable hour dragged to a close; then I heard his welcome tread, and rose gasping and tottered to meet him.","几乎难以忍受的一个钟头硬是给熬过去了。接着我听到了他欢快的脚步声，于是我气喘吁吁、踉踉跄跄地上前去迎接他。"
"How his fine eyes flamed with triumph!","他明亮的眼睛里闪耀着何等得意的神采啊！"
"He said:","他说："
"“We’ve compromised!","“我们已经私下了结了！"
"The jokers will sing a different tune to-morrow!","那些看我们笑话的家伙们明天就要变个调子在那儿嚷嚷啦！"
"Follow me!”","跟我来！”"
"He took a lighted candle and strode down into the vast vaulted basement where sixty detectives always slept, and where a score were now playing cards to while the time.","他手持一根点燃的蜡烛，大步走进一个很大的拱顶地下室。平常那儿是六十个警探睡觉的地方，此时只有二十个人在那里打牌消磨时间。"
"I followed close after him.","我紧紧地跟在他后面。"
"He walked swiftly down to the dim and remote end of the place, and just as I succumbed to the pangs of suffocation and was swooning away he stumbled and fell over the outlying members of a mighty object, and I heard him exclaim as he went down:","他迅速地朝地下室阴暗、偏僻的那头走去，当我正被闷得快要晕过去时，他也被绊倒了，跌在一个庞然大物伸开的肢体上。我听见他在倒下去的时候大喊："
"“Our noble profession is vindicated.","“我们这行的脸面还是给捡回来了。"
"Here is your elephant!”","你的那头大象在这儿呢！”"
"I was carried to the office above and restored with carbolic acid.","我被抬到上面的办公室，人们用石炭酸使我苏醒过来。"
"The whole detective force swarmed in, and such another season of triumphant rejoicing ensued as I had never witnessed before.","然后整个警探队蜂拥而入，接着就举行了胜利狂欢会，那种热闹场面是我之前从未目睹过的。"
"The reporters were called, baskets of champagne were opened, toasts were drunk, the handshakings and congratulations were continuous and enthusiastic.","他们还请来了记者，开了一箱又一箱的香槟。大家举杯祝酒，不停地、激动地握手祝贺。"
"Naturally the chief was the hero of the hour, and his happiness was so complete and had been so patiently and worthily and bravely won that it made me happy to see it, though I stood there a homeless beggar, my priceless charge dead, and my position in my country’s service lost to me through what would always seem my fatally careless execution of a great trust.","此时督察长当然是我们的英雄。他开心到了极点，一直以来是他如此耐心、如此可敬、如此勇敢才笑到了最后。我看了也很高兴，尽管我像一个无家可归的乞丐那样站在那里，委托给我的无价之宝死了，为国家服务的职位也因我对一项重大使命似乎是严重的掉以轻心而失去了。"
"Many an eloquent eye testified its deep admiration for the chief, and many a detective’s voice murmured, “Look at him—just the king of the profession; only give him a clue, it’s all he wants, and there ain’t anything hid that he can’t find.”","许多人意味深长地望着头领，表达他们对他深深的钦佩，还有许多警探低声在说，“瞧他——真可以在我们这行里称王。只要给他一点儿线索，他也只需要这一点儿线索，那就没有什么隐藏的东西是他找不出来的。”"
"The dividing of the fifty thousand dollars made great pleasure; when it was finished the chief made a little speech while he put his share in his pocket, in which he said, “Enjoy it, boys, for you’ve earned it; and, more than that, you’ve earned for the detective profession undying fame.”","分五万元奖金的时候，大家欣喜万分。分配完毕，督察长把自己的那份放进腰包，并简短地发了言。他说：“伙计们，用它好好享受一下吧，这是你们挣来的；而且不仅如此，你们还为警探这一行赢得了不朽之名声。”"
"A telegram arrived, which read:","接着来了一份电报，说："
"MONROE, MICH., 10 P.M.","下午十点，密歇根州，门罗镇."
"First time I’ve struck a telegraph office in over three weeks.","三周来首次遇一电报局。"
"Have followed those footprints, horseback, through the woods, a thousand miles to here, and they get stronger and bigger and fresher every day.","骑马循足迹越森林，历一千英里抵此，足迹日益深、大、鲜明。"
"Don’t worry-inside of another week I’ll have the elephant.","勿虑,下周内必获此象。"
"This is dead sure.","万保无虞。"
"DARLEY, Detective.","警探达。。"
"The chief ordered three cheers for “Darley, one of the finest minds on the force,” and then commanded that he be telegraphed to come home and receive his share of the reward.","督察长命令大家为“该队最出色警探之一的达利”欢呼三声，然后吩咐人去发电报让达利归队，并来领他那份奖金。"
"So ended that marvelous episode of the stolen elephant.","于是白象被偷这一非同寻常事件就此结束。"
"The newspapers were pleasant with praises once more, the next day, with one contemptible exception.","第二天，报纸上又是一片赞美声，只有一家不值得一提的报纸例外。"
"This sheet said, “Great is the detective!","这份报纸上说:“警探真是了不起！"
"He may be a little slow in finding a little thing like a mislaid elephant he may hunt him all day and sleep with his rotting carcass all night for three weeks, but he will find him at last if he can get the man who mislaid him to show him the place!”","他在寻找大象这种丢失了的小小的东西时手脚可能慢了一点儿。三周以来，他白天外出寻找它，晚上却和它慢慢腐烂的尸体睡在一起，但是他最终还是会找到它的——只要他能找到那个把它放错了地方的人，让他说出那个地方就可以了！”"
"Poor Hassan was lost to me forever.","我永远地失去了可怜的哈桑。"
"The cannonshots had wounded him fatally, he had crept to that unfriendly place in the fog, and there, surrounded by his enemies and in constant danger of detection, he had wasted away with hunger and suffering till death gave him peace.","炮弹使它受了致命伤，它在浓雾中爬到了那个于它不利的地方——那里被它的敌人包围着，随时有被发觉的危险。它在饥饿与伤痛的折磨中日渐衰弱，直到死亡使它平静。"
"The compromise cost me one hundred thousand dollars; my detective expenses were forty-two thousand dollars more; I never applied for a place again under my government; I am a ruined man and a wanderer on the earth but my admiration for that man, whom I believe to be the greatest detective the world has ever produced, remains undimmed to this day, and will so remain unto the end.","那次妥协花掉我十万美元，雇警探的费用又另花掉我四万二千美元；我没有再向我的政府申请职位；我破产了，成了世上的一个流浪汉；但是我对那个我认为是世界上最了不起的大警探的钦佩之情至今从未削减，而且会一直持续到我人生结束的那一天。"
