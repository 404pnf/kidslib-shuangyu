"治安法官贝内加·威德普坐在办公室门口，抽着他的接骨木杆烟斗。坎伯兰山脉高耸入云，山腰被午后的薄雾笼罩着，呈现出灰蓝色。一只花母鸡大摇大摆地走在“殖民地”的大街上，傻乎乎地咯咯叫着。","Justice-Of-The-Peace Benaja Widdup sat in the door of his office smoking his elder-stem pipe.Halfway to the zenith the Cumberland range rose blue-gray in the afternoon haze.A speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the “settlement,” cackling foolishly."
"路的另一头传来嘎吱嘎吱的车轴声，紧接着，在缓缓升起的尘土中，一辆牛车载着兰西·比尔布罗和他的老婆来了。牛车停在法官门前，两个人爬了下来。兰西瘦瘦的，身高约六英尺，黄头发，皮肤呈黄褐色。高山般的冷峻如同一副盔甲，披在他的身上。那个女人穿着印花棉布衣服，佝偻着身子，牙被鼻烟熏得发黄，莫可名状的渴望将她折磨得精疲力尽。这一切都隐约流露出她的不满，怨这个男人在不知不觉间骗走了自己的青春。","Up the road came a sound of creaking axles, and then a slow cloud of dust, and then a bull-cart bearing Ransie Bilbro and his wife.The cart stopped at the Justice’s door, and the two climbed down.Ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair.The imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour.The woman was calicoed, angled, snuff-brushed, and weary with unknown desires.Through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss."
"为了显示威严，治安法官迅速将脚塞入鞋子，挪开身让他们俩进来。","The Justice of the Peace slipped his feet into his shoes, for the sake of dignity, and moved to let them enter."
"“我们俩，”女人说，声音像风吹过松树枝，“想离婚。”她看着兰西，看他能否在她对两人来意的叙述中发掘出任何瑕疵、含糊、隐瞒、偏见或私心。","“We-all,” said the woman, in a voice like the wind blowing through pine boughs, “wants a divo’ce.”She looked at Ransie to see if he noted any flaw or ambiguity or evasion or partiality or self-partisanship in her statement of their business."
"“离婚，”兰西一脸严肃地重复道，“我俩过不下去了。就算一个男人和一个女人相亲相爱，住在大山里也够冷清的。更何况，在小木屋里，她要么像野猫那样撒野，要么跟森鸮似的沉着脸，男人还有什么必要跟她过下去。”","“A divo’ce,” repeated Ransie, with a solemn Dod.“We-all can’t git along together nohow.It’s lonesome enough fur to live in the mount’ins when a man and a woman keers fur one another.But when she’s a-spittin’ like a wildcat or a-sullenin’ like a hoot-owl in the cabin, a man ain’t got no call to live with her.”"
"“他是个没用的混混，”女人说，“对啥都不上心，就知道跟一帮无赖和酒贩子鬼混，躺在床上喝玉米威士忌，还养一群烦人的饿狗让我喂！”","“When he’s a no-’count varmint,” said the woman, “without any especial warmth, a-traipsin’ along of scalawags and moonshiners and a-layin’ on his back pizen ’ith co’n whiskey, and a-pesterin’ folks with a pack o’ hungry, triflin’ houn’s to feed!”"
"“她老摔锅盖，”兰西反唇相讥，“把滚烫的水浇到坎伯兰最好的猎浣熊狗身上，总不给男人弄吃的，整晚因为些破事数落男人，弄得人睡不成觉！＂","“When she keeps a-throwin’ skillet lids,” came Ransie’s antiphony, “and slings b’ilin’ water on the best coon-dog in the Cumberlands, and sets herself agin’ cookin’ a man’s victuals, and keeps him awake o’ nights accusin’ him of a sight of doin’s!”"
"”他老不交税，在山里落了个吝啬鬼的坏名声，谁夜里能睡着？“","“When he’s al’ays a-fightin’ the revenues, and gits a hard name in the mount’ins fur a mean man, who’s gwine to be able fur to sleep o’ nights?”"
"治安法官开始认真地履行起他的职责来。他给他的当事人一把椅子和一条木凳。接着，他翻开桌上的法典，开始浏览索引。一会儿，他又擦擦眼镜，挪挪墨水瓶。","The Justice of the Peace stirred deliberately to his duties.He placed his one chair and a wooden stool for his petitioners.He opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned the index.Presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand."
"“法律法规中，”他说，“就本庭的司法权而言，没有提到离婚的问题。”但根据衡平法、宪法还有为人准则，有买有卖才不亏本。如果一个治安法官能让一对男女结婚，显然也有权让他们离婚。本庭将判决离婚，并由最高法院核准其法律效力。“","“The law and the statutes,” said he, “air silent on the subjeck of divo’ce as fur as the jurisdiction of this co’t air concerned.But, accordin’ to equity and the Constitution and the golden rule, it’s a bad barg’in that can’t run both ways.If a justice of the peace can marry a couple, it’s plain that he is bound to be able to divo’ce ’em.This here office will issue a decree of divo’ce and abide by the decision of the Supreme Co’t to hold it good.”"
"兰西·比尔布罗从裤兜里掏出一只小烟袋。他从里面抖出一张五美元的钞票，让它落在桌上。“我卖了一张熊皮和两张狐狸皮，才赚来这钱。”他声明，“这是我们所有的钱。”","Ransie Bilbro drew a small tobacco-bag from his trousers pocket.Out of this he shook upon the table a five-dollar note.“Sold a b’arskin and two foxes fur that,” he remarked.“It’s all the money we got.”"
"“本庭受理离婚的固定价格，”法官说，“是五美元。”他装作漫不经心地把钱塞进手织背心的口袋里。承受着极大的肉体痛苦和精神折磨，他在半张大页纸上写下了判决令，又在另外半张纸上抄了一份。兰西·比尔布罗和他老婆听治安法官宣读了那即将赋予他们自由的文件：","“The regular price of a divo’ce in this co’t,” said the Justice, “air five dollars.”He stuffed the bill into the pocket of his homespun vest with a deceptive air of indifference.With much bodily toil and mental travail he wrote the decree upon half a sheet of foolscap, and then copied it upon the other.Ransie Bilbro and his wife listened to his reading of the document that was to give them freedom:"
"“双方当事人兰西·比尔布罗及其妻阿里娜·比尔布罗，今日亲自到场，承诺从今以后，无论祸福，不再互敬互爱，彼此依顺。当事人神志清醒，身体健康。考虑到本州的安宁与尊严，准予离婚。判决即刻生效，上帝保佑你们。贝内加·威德普，田纳西州皮德蒙特县治安法官。”","“Know all men by these presents that Ransie Bilbro and his wife, Ariela Bilbro, this day personally appeared before me and promises that hereinafter they will neither love, honour, nor obey each other, neither for better nor worse, being of sound mind and body, and accept summons for divorce according to the peace and dignity of the State.Herein fail not, so help you God.Benaja Widdup, justice of the peace in and for the county of Piedmont, State of Tennessee.”"
"法官正要把其中的一份文件递给兰西。听到阿里娜开口说话，他便暂时没动。两个男人都看着她。由于男人天生的愚钝，他们根本没料到这女人会突然来这么一手。","The Justice was about to hand one of the documents to Ransie.The voice of Ariela delayed the transfer.Both men looked at her.Their dull masculinity was confronted by something sudden and unexpected in the woman."
"“法官，先别给他那张纸。事情还没了结呢。我得先维护一下我的权利。我应该得到一笔赡养费。男人和老婆离了婚，一分钱也不给她，那可行不通。我现在什么都没有了，准备搬到霍格巴克山上埃德兄弟家去。我得有双鞋，一些鼻烟，加上其他一些东西。兰西既然付得起离婚的钱，就让他给我赡养费。”","“Judge, don’t you give him that air paper yit.’Tain’t all settled, nohow.I got to have my rights first.I got to have my ali-money.’Tain’t no kind of a way to do fur a man to divo’ce his wife ’thout her havin’ a cent fur to do with.I’m a-layin’ off to be a-goin’ up to brother Ed’s up on Hogback Mount’in.I’m bound fur to hev a pa’r of shoes and some snuff and things besides.Ef Rance kin affo’d a divo’ce, let him pay me ali-money.”"
"兰西·比尔布罗惊呆了，不知所措。她从前只字未提赡养费的事。女人总能生出些意外的事端，让人大吃一惊。","Ransie Bilbro was stricken to dumb perplexity.There had been no previous hint of alimony.Women were always bringing up startling and unlooked-for issues."
"贝内加·威德普法官觉得法庭需要就此事作出裁决。当地的法律法规中也没提到赡养费的问题。但这个女人光着脚。而去霍格巴克山的小路布满燧石，十分崎岖。","Justice Benaja Widdup felt that the point demanded judicial decision.The authorities were also silent on the subject of alimony.But the woman’s feet were bare.The trail to Hogback Mountain was steep and flinty."
"“阿里娜·比尔布罗，”他打着官腔问，“你认为本案中赡养费应为多少，才算合情合理？”","“Ariela Bilbro,” he asked, in official tones, “how much did you ’low would be good and sufficient ali-money in the case befo’ the co’t.”"
"“我认为，”她答道，“买鞋还有其他东西，得要五美元。这笔赡养费不多，但我想应该够我到埃德兄弟家了。”","“I ’lowed,” she answered, “fur the shoes and all, to say five dollars.That ain’t much fur ali-money, but I reckon that’ll git me to up brother Ed’s.”"
"“这个数目，”法官说，“也不是不合理。兰西·比尔布罗，本庭命令你先支付给原告五美元，然后再发离婚证。”","“The amount,” said the Justice, “air not onreasonable.Ransie Bilbro, you air ordered by the co’t to pay the plaintiff the sum of five dollars befo’ the decree of divo’ce air issued.”"
"“我没钱了，”兰西喘着粗气说，“我所有的钱都付给你了。”","“I hain’t no mo’ money,” breathed Ransie, heavily.“I done paid you all I had.”"
"“如果拒不服从，”法官从镜片上方朝兰西投去严厉的目光，“你就是藐视法庭。”","“Otherwise,” said the Justice, looking severely over his spectacles, “you air in contempt of co’t.”"
"“我想，如果容我明天再付，”这位丈夫请求道，“我一定能设法搞到这笔钱。我根本没想到要付赡养费。”","“I reckon if you gimme till to-morrow,” pleaded the husband, “I mout be able to rake or scrape it up somewhars.I never looked for to be a-payin’ no alimoney.”"
"“本案休庭，”贝内加·威德普说，“明日你们两人到庭，接受本庭宣判。然后发给你们离婚证书。”他在门口坐下，开始解鞋带。","“The case air adjourned,” said Benaja Widdup, “till to-morrow, when you-all will present yo’selves and obey the order of the co’t.Followin’ of which the decrees of divo’ce will be delivered.”He sat down in the door and began to loosen a shoestring."
"“我们不妨下山到齐亚叔叔家去，”兰西说，“在他家过夜。”他从一侧爬到车上，阿里娜从另一侧爬上去。他缰绳一抖，小红牛慢慢转过弯，上了路；牛车在车轮扬起的尘土中缓缓离去了。","“We mout as well go down to Uncle Ziah’s,” decided Ransie, “and spend the night.”He climbed into the cart on one side, and Ariela climbed in on the other.Obeying the flap of his rope, the little red bull slowly came around on a tack, and the cart crawled away in the nimbus arising from its wheels."
"治安法官贝内加·威德普抽起了他的接骨木杆烟斗。傍晚，他收到了周报，一直读到暮色降临，报上的字再也看不清。 于是，他在桌子上点起一根油蜡，接着读到月亮升起。吃晚饭的时间到了。他住在山坡上的一座双层木屋里，不远处有一棵剥了皮的杨树。回家吃晚饭的途中，他穿过一条掩映在月桂树丛中的小岔道。 一个黑影从月桂树丛中跳出来，用一把步枪抵住了他的胸膛。那人的帽子拉得很低，大半张脸都被什么东西遮住了。","Justice-of-the-peace Benaja Widdup smoked his elderstem pipe.Late in the afternoon he got his weekly paper, and read it until the twilight dimmed its lines.Then he lit the tallow candle on his table, and read until the moon rose, marking the time for supper.He lived in the double log cabin on the slope near the girdled poplar.Going home to supper he crossed a little branch darkened by a laurel thicket.The dark figure of a man stepped from the laurels and pointed a rifle at his breast.His hat was pulled down low, and something covered most of his face."
"“把你的钱交出来，”那黑影说，“废话少说。我的脾气要上来了，随时都可能扣动扳机。”","“I want yo’ money,” said the figure, “’thout any talk.I’m gettin’ nervous, and my finger’s a-wabblin’ on this here trigger.”"
"“我只有五——五——五美元。”法官说着，从背心口袋里摸出那张钞票。","“I’ve only got f-f-five dollars,” said the Justice, producing it from his vest pocket."
"“把它卷起来，”那人命令道，“然后塞进枪口。”","“Roll it up,” came the order, “and stick it in the end of this here gun-bar’l.”"
"这是张崭新的票子。尽管法官笨拙的手指在瑟瑟发抖，却还是没费多大劲就把钱卷成筒，塞进了枪口（虽然这个动作没有前一个动作那么从容）。","The bill was crisp and new.Even fingers that were clumsy and trembling found little difficulty in making a spill of it and inserting it (this with less ease) into the muzzle of the rifle."
"“现在，我想你可以走了。”强盗说。","“Now I reckon you kin be goin’ along,” said the robber."
"法官一溜烟地跑了。","The Justice lingered not on his way."
"第二天，小红牛拉着车来到法庭门口。因为知道有人要来，贝内加·威德普早就穿好了鞋子。当着法官的面，兰西比尔·布罗给了他妻子一张五美元的票子。法官锐利的目光扫过那张钞票。那票子看上去皱皱巴巴的，仿佛曾被卷起来塞进枪口。但法官强忍着没说话。别的票子也很容易被弄皱，这是事实。他递给两人每人一张离婚证书。两人尴尬地站在那里，谁也不说话，只是慢慢折起那自由的保证书。那女人局促而羞怯地瞥了兰西一眼。","The next day came the little red bull, drawing the cart to the office door.Justice Benaja Widdup had his shoes on, for he was expecting the visit.In his presence Ransie Bilbro handed to his wife a five-dollar bill.The official’s eye sharply viewed it.It seemed to curl up as though it had been rolled and inserted into the end of a gun-barrel.But the Justice refrained from comment.It is true that other bills might be inclined to curl.He handed each one a decree of divorce.Each stood awkwardly silent, slowly folding the guarantee of freedom.The woman cast a shy glance full of constraint at Ransie."
"“我想你要回小木屋了。”她站在牛车旁说，“隔板上的罐头盒里有面包。我把咸肉放在烧水壶里了，免得狗偷吃。今晚别忘了给钟上发条。”","“I reckon you’ll be goin’ back up to the cabin,” she said, along ’ith the bull-cart.There’s bread in the tin box settin’ on the shelf.I put the bacon in the b’ilin’-pot to keep the hounds from gittin’ it.Don’t forget to wind the clock to-night.”"
"“你要去你埃德兄弟家？”兰西问，摆出一副漠不关心的样子。","“You air a-goin’ to your brother Ed’s?” asked Ransie, with fine unconcern."
"“天黑前我应该能赶到那儿。我根本就没指望他们欢迎我，但我没别的地方可去。路很远，我想我最好现在就走。我得说再见了，兰西——再见，如果你也愿意说再见的话。”","“I was ’lowin’ to get along up thar afore night.I ain’t sayin’ as they’ll pester theyselves any to make me welcome, but I hain’t nowhar else fur to go.It’s a right smart ways, and I reckon I better be goin’.I’ll be a-sayin’ good-bye, Ranse—that is, if you keer fur to say so.”"
"“哪有人连再见也不愿意说的，”兰西的语气活像个殉道者，“那不成了癞皮狗啦——除非你急着走，不想让我说了。”　","“I don’t know as anybody’s a hound dog,” said Ransie, in a martyr’s voice, “fur to not want to say good-bye—’less you air so anxious to git away that you don’t want me to say it.”"
"阿里娜没说话。她把那张五美元的票子和离婚证书仔细折好，揣在怀里。贝内加·威德普透过眼镜片，用悲伤的眼神望着那张票子消失。","Ariela was silent.She folded the five-dollar bill and her decree carefully, and placed them in the bosom of her dress.Benaja Widdup watched the money disappear with mournful eyes behind his spectacles."
"接着，兰西嘴里蹦出一句话（正是他思绪联翩的脑子里所想的），这句话听上去有点像世上数不胜数的慈悲者在仰天长叹，又有点像少之又少的金融大鳄在大发感慨。","And then with his next words he achieved rank (as his thoughts ran) with either the great crowd of the world’s sympathizers or the little crowd of its great financiers."
"“今晚的小破屋将会有点冷清兰斯。”他说。","“Be kind o’ lonesome in the old cabin to-night, Ranse,” he said."
"兰西·比尔布罗望着坎伯兰山脉；澄净的阳光下，群山一片蔚蓝。他没有看阿里娜。","Ransie Bilbro stared out at the Cumberlands, clear blue now in the sunlight.He did not look at Ariela."
"“会很冷清的，我知道。”他说，“但是有人疯了，非要离婚，你留不住呀。”","“I ’low it might be lonesome,” he said; “but when folks gits mad and wants a divo’ce, you can’t make folks stay.”"
"“有人正想离呢。”阿里娜仿佛在跟木凳说话，“而且，也没人想留我呀。”","“There’s others wanted a divo’ce,” said Ariela, speaking to the wooden stool.“Besides, nobody don’t want nobody to stay.”"
" “没人说不想留你。”","“Nobody never said they didn’t.”"
"“也没人说想留我呀。我想我最好现在就动身去埃德兄弟家。”","“Nobody never said they did.I reckon I better start on now to brother Ed’s.”"
"“没人给那老钟上发条了。”","“Nobody can’t wind that old clock.”"
"“想让我跟你坐车回去，给钟上发条吗，兰西？”","“Want me to go back along ’ith you in the cart and wind it fur you, Ranse?”"
"山里人的脸从不流露任何情感。但他伸出宽大的手掌，握住了阿里娜又黑又瘦的手。她冷漠的脸上突然闪过一丝热情，她的面容变得那么神圣。","The mountaineer’s countenance was proof against emotion.But he reached out a big hand and enclosed Ariela’s thin brown one.Her soul peeped out once through her impassive face, hallowing it."
"“那些猎狗再也不会烦你了。”兰西说，“我想我从前是太刻薄、太没出息了。你给那钟上发条吧，阿里娜。”","“Them hounds shan’t pester you no more,” said Ransie.“I reckon I been mean and low down.You wind that clock, Ariela.”"
"“我的心一直留在那小屋里呢，兰西，”她低声说，“留在你身边。我再也不会发疯了。让我们上路吧，兰西，好赶在日落前到家。”他们往门口走去，早已忘了治安法官贝内加·威德普的存在；这时，他拦住了他们。","“My heart hit’s in that cabin, Ranse,” she whispered, “along ’ith you.I ai’nt a-goin’ to git mad no more.Le’s be startin’, Ranse, so’s we kin git home by sundown.”Justice-of-the-peace Benaja Widdup interposed as they started for the door, forgetting his presence."
"“以田纳西州的名义，”他说，“我禁止你们违反本州的法律法规。本庭很乐意、也很高兴看到不和与误解的乌云从两颗相爱的心中飘走，但是本庭有责任维护本州的道德规范与法律公正。本庭提醒你们，你们不再是夫妻，你们的离婚已经过正式判决，因此，你们不再享有夫妻权益。“","“In the name of the State of Tennessee,” he said, “I forbid you-all to be a-defyin’ of its laws and statutes.This co’t is mo’ than willin’ and full of joy to see the clouds of discord and misunderstandin’ rollin’ away from two lovin’ hearts, but it air the duty of the co’t to p’eserve the morals and integrity of the State.The co’t reminds you that you air no longer man and wife, but air divo’ced by regular decree, and as such air not entitled to the benefits and ’purtenances of the mattermonal estate.”"
"阿里娜抓住兰西的胳膊。难道这些话意味着，在他们刚刚从生活中得到教训之时，她却必须要失去他？","Ariela caught Ransie’s arm.Did those words mean that she must lose him now when they had just learned the lesson of life?"
"”但是，”法官接着说，“本庭准备移除离婚判决造成的障碍。本庭随时可为本案双方举行庄重的结婚仪式，使他们修补裂痕，重新结合，恢复他们所渴求的光荣高尚的婚姻。就本案而言，承办仪式的费用，为五美元。”","“But the co’t air prepared,” went on the Justice, “fur to remove the disabilities set up by the decree of divo’ce.The co’t air on hand to perform the solemn ceremony of marri’ge, thus fixin’ things up and enablin’ the parties in the case to resume the honour’ble and elevatin’ state of mattermony which they desires.The fee fur performin’ said ceremony will be, in this case, to wit, five dollars.”"
" 阿里娜抓住了他话中的一线希望。她迅速把手伸向怀中。 那票子如同一只鸽子，飞落到法官的桌子上。当她和兰西手拉手站着，听法官宣告他们重新结为夫妻时，她灰黄的脸上泛起了血色。","Aricla caught the gleam of promise in his words.Swiftly her hand went to her bosom.Freely as an alighting dove the bill fluttered to the Justice’s table.Her sallow cheek coloured as she stood hand in hand with Ransie and listened to the reuniting words."
"兰西扶她上了车，自己也爬上去，坐在她身边。小红牛又一次掉头上路；他们紧紧握住彼此的手，朝着大山出发了。","Ransie helped her into the cart, and climbed in beside her.The little red bull turned once more, and they set out, hand-clasped, for the mountains."
"治安法官贝内加·威德普坐在门口，脱掉他的鞋子。他又用手摸了摸塞在背心口袋里的那张钞票。他又抽起了他的接骨木杆烟斗。而那只花母鸡，又大摇大摆地走在“殖民地”的大街上，傻乎乎地咯咯叫着。","Justice-of-the-peace Benaja Widdup sat in his door and took off his shoes.Once again he fingered the bill tucked down in his vest pocket.Once again he smoked his elder-stem pipe.Once again the speck-led hen swaggered down the main street of the “settlement,” cackling foolishly."
