		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >主席先生，女士们，先生们：感谢诸位刚才对我的夸赞，为了表达我的感激之情，我尽量少说几句，以免诸位生厌。很高兴能在我们的故土之上，以这样一种和平的方式庆祝一个实验的周年纪念日。很久以前，正是在这片土地上酝酿了一个关于两国战争的实验，而在我们的祖先艰苦卓绝的斗争之下，这个实验演变成了一个成功的话题。美英两国花了近百年的时间才建立起这种友善、彼此尊重的关系。但我相信，如今我们终于实现了上述目标。最近的两起争端，两国采用仲裁方式进行解决而不再选用大炮进行对峙，这是向前迈了一大步。当英国采用我们的缝纫机而不再像以前那样宣称这是他们的发明时，这又向前迈了一大步。不久前，英国还从我国进口了一种卧铺车厢，这就再次向前迈了一步。就在昨天，我亲眼看见一位英国朋友完全出于他本人意愿点了一份美国冰雪利酒，不仅如此，他还极其内行并且冷静地提醒吧台服务员别忘记加草莓。这一场景温暖了我，难以言表。共同的祖先，共同的语言，共同的文学，共同的信仰，以及共同的饮料，我们还需要什么来永葆两国之间的兄弟情谊呢？</td>
		<td class="en">MR. CHAIRMAN AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I thank you for the compliment which has just been tendered me, and to show my appreciation of it I will not afflict you with many words.It is pleasant to celebrate in this peaceful way, upon this old mother soil, the anniversary of an experiment which was born of war with this same land so long ago, and wrought out to a successful issue by the devotion of our ancestors.It has taken nearly a hundred years to bring the English and Americans into kindly and mutually appreciative relations, but I believe it has been accomplished at last.It was a great step when the two last misunderstandings were settled by arbitration instead of cannon.It is another great step when England adopts our sewing-machines without claiming the invention—as usual.It was another when they imported one of our sleeping-cars the other day.And it warmed my heart more than I can tell, yesterday, when I witnessed the spectacle of an Englishman ordering an American sherry cobbler of his own free will and accord—and not only that but with a great brain and a level head reminding the barkeeper not to forget the strawberries.With a common origin, a common language, a common literature, a common religion and—common drinks, what is longer needful to the cementing of the two nations together in a permanent bond of brotherhood?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们处在一个进步的时代，我们的国家是一个进步的国家。一个伟大而光荣的国度——它培养了华盛顿、富兰克林、威廉·M. 特威德、朗费罗、莫特利、杰伊·古尔德、塞缪尔·C. 波默罗伊，刚刚创立了无与伦比的（在某些方面）国会，缔造了一支优秀的美利坚合众国军队，曾耗用8个月时间耐心降服60名印第安人——上帝知道这可比野蛮的大屠杀文明多了。此外我们拥有优于世界上任何国家的刑事陪审团制度；影响该制度效率的唯一难题就是每天要找到12个一无所知、目不识丁的人。另外，我还注意到我们有一则对精神病人的辩护，连谋杀罪行都能赦免。我想我可以说，而且想骄傲地说，与世界上其他的立法机构相比，我们的立法机构带来更高的费用。</td>
		<td class="en">This is an age of progress, and ours is a progressive land.A great and glorious land, too—a land which has developed a Washington, a Franklin, a William M. Tweed, a Longfellow, a Motley, a Jay Gould, a Samuel C. Pomeroy, a recent Congress which has never had its equal (in some respects), and a United States Army which conquered sixty Indians in eight months by tiring them out—which is much better than uncivilized slaughter, God knows.We have a criminal jury system which is superior to any in the world; and its efficiency is only marred by the difficulty of finding twelve men every day who don’t know anything and can’t read.And I may observe that we have an insanity plea that would have saved Cain.I think I can say,—and say with pride, that we have some legislatures that bring higher prices than any in the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在提到我们的铁路系统时，我是热情满满的。它让我们活着，但它也可能做相反的事情——变成我们的主人。去年，铁路系统出现撞车事故，只造成了3,070人次死亡而已，此外27,260个路人因穿铁路时粗心大意而丧生。铁路公司为这30,000人的丧生深感懊悔，以至于决定对其中一些人进行赔付——当然这是出于公司自愿，因为即便是我们当中最卑鄙的人也不会宣称我们的法院会乘机敲诈铁路公司。不过，感谢上天，铁路公司通常都会自发地做些正确的善事，不需外界强迫。我记得有件事当时让我深深触动。一次事故后，铁路公司把我亲爱的远房老亲戚的遗体用筐运回家，还附言：“请您开出赔偿的价码——顺便把筐还回。”瞧，不可能有比这更友善的吧？</td>
		<td class="en">I refer with effusion to our railway system, which consents to let us live, though it might do the opposite, being our owners.It only destroyed three thousand and seventy lives last year by collisions, and twenty-seven thousand two hundred and sixty by running over heedless and unnecessary people at crossings.The companies seriously regretted the killing of these thirty thousand people, and went so far as to pay for some of them—voluntarily, of course, for the meanest of us would not claim that we possess a court treacherous enough to enforce a law against a railway company.But, thank Heaven, the railway companies are generally disposed to do the right and kindly thing without compulsion.I know of an instance which greatly touched me at the time.After an accident the company sent home the remains of a dear distant old relative of mine in a basket, with the remark, “Please state what figure you hold him at—and return the basket.”Now there couldn’t be anything friendlier than that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过我绝对不会站在这里吹嘘一晚上。我想各位也不会介意一个人在7月4日国庆时夸几句他的祖国吧。这可是让美利坚鹰旗飘扬的好时候。我就再说一句自夸的话——一句充满希望的话。那就是：我们的政府给予每个人公平的机会，对谁都无偏袒。我们之中没有人生来就有权利看不起或蔑视他的邻居。让我们这些不是公爵的人从中找到慰藉吧。我们能够充满希望地迎接未来，因为事实是：尽管当今我国的政治道德状况不令人满意，但英国的状况更为糟糕。自从查理一世授予他的情妇贵族头衔后，全部政治职位只不过是讨价还价的交易筹码。我们仍有希望。</td>
		<td class="en">But I must not stand here and brag all night.However, you won’t mind a body bragging a little about his country on the fourth of July.It is a fair and legitimate time to fly the eagle.I will say only one more word of brag—and a hopeful one.It is this.We have a form of government which gives each man a fair chance and no favor.With us no individual is born with a right to look down upon his neighbor and hold him in contempt.Let such of us as are not dukes find our consolation in that.And we may find hope for the future in the fact that as unhappy as is the condition of our political morality to-day, England has risen up out of a far fouler since the days when Charles I. ennobled courtesans and all political place was a matter of bargain and sale.There is hope for us yet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（至少上文是我原计划现场演说的。但我们的公使申克将军主持大会，祈祷之后，他起身发表一通很长的极度无聊的高谈阔论，要结束的时候说既然演讲好像不能激发宾客的热情，那就取消当晚所有其他的演讲，我们就坐着和自己身边的朋友私下聊聊天，度过一段愉快的社交时光吧。众所周知，他那句话造成的后果是致使44篇完美的演说胎死腹中。此后，死气沉沉、忧郁、肃穆的气氛笼罩着晚餐，成为当晚许多与会嘉宾永恒的记忆。因为那句轻率的话，申克将军在英国失去了44位密友。当天晚上不止一个人说：“想不到就是派这种人代表我们去伟大的友邦帝国做使节！”）</td>
		<td class="en">[At least the above is the speech which I was going to make, but our minister, General Schenck, presided, and after the blessing, got up and made a great long inconceivably dull harangue, and wound up by saying that inasmuch as speech-making did not seem to exhilarate the guests much, all further oratory would be dispensed with during the evening, and we could just sit and talk privately to our elbow-neighbors and have a good sociable time.It is known that in consequence of that remark forty-four perfected speeches died in the womb.The depression, the gloom, the solemnity that reigned over the banquet from that time forth will be a lasting memory with many that were there.By that one thoughtless remark General Schenck lost forty-four of the best friends he had in England.More than one said that night, “And this is the sort of person that is sent to represent us in a great sister empire!”] </td></tr>
