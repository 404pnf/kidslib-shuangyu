		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我爸爸是一条圣伯纳狗，我妈妈是一条柯利牧羊狗，而我却是条长老会教友狗。我妈妈是这样告诉我的，而我自己不知道这些微妙的区别。对我而言，这些冠冕堂皇的词语毫无意义。我妈妈喜欢这样，她喜欢说这些，喜欢看别的狗听她说话时又惊讶又嫉妒的样子。他们还会好奇她怎么会受过这么多教育。但是，老实说，这并不是真正的知识，只是一种炫耀而已。有人在饭厅和客厅里谈话时，她就在旁边听，而且她还跟孩子们一起去主日学校听课，因此学会了这些词。每当她听到一个“大词”，就会默念很多次，将它记下来。之后在附近有讲教义的聚会时，她就将其搬出来。其他的狗，从小狗到大驯犬都会对此感到吃惊和苦恼，这样她所花的功夫就值得了。如果是只陌生狗的话，他几乎都会产生怀疑。当他喘息初定后，他就会问她那是什么意思。她总是能够回答上来。他没料到情况会是这样。他以为自己能够难倒她，让她感到羞愧。然而，当她把意思告诉他的时候，反而是他显得不好意思了。别的狗都在等着这个结局，大家都为此而高兴，为她感到自豪。他们都知道事情会发展成这样，因为他们都有经验。当她把一个“大词”的意思告诉人家时，他们都对她佩服得五体投地；从来没有哪只狗对她的解释有所怀疑。这是很自然的。首先因为她回答得十分快，就像字典在说话一样。另外，他们根本不知道去哪儿才能弄清楚这到底是对还是错。因为她是唯一一只有学问的狗。很快，我就长大了。有一次，她记住了“非理智”这个词。整整一周，她在各种集会上都拼命地卖弄，让其他狗又伤心又沮丧。就在那一次，我发现在一个星期里的八个不同集会上，她都被问到这个词的意思，每一次她都能很快说出一个新解释。这让我看出，与其说她是有文化，倒不如说她沉着镇定。不过，我当然什么也没有说。她总是有一个备用的词，就像救生圈一样。当她有被冲下船的危险时，她就会将它套在头上来救急——这个词就是“同义词”。当她碰巧搬出几星期前卖弄过的一个很长的单词，而且把之前准备好的解释忘得一干二净时，要是有陌生的客人在场，这肯定会把他弄得晕头转向好几分钟。当他清醒过来，她却调转方向，顺着风的另一个方向跑了，没有想过会出现任何问题。所以当他跟她打招呼，请她讲清楚的时候，我（唯一一只清楚她的把戏的狗）看见她的帆布抖动了一下——只是一下——然后又鼓满绷紧了。她像夏天一样平静地说：“它与‘额外工作’是同义词。”或者说出了一个类似的邪恶的长单词，她边说边平静地走动着，然后迅速滑向下一个方向，离开了。她看起来非常平静，而那位生客却显得很无知、很尴尬。其他对此已经司空见惯的狗一致往地上猛拍尾巴，并且脸上露出了快乐的神情。</td>
		<td class="en">My father was a St. Bernard, my mother was a collie, but I am a Presbyterian.This is what my mother told me, I do not know these nice distinctions myself.To me they are only fine large words meaning nothing.My mother had a fondness for such; she liked to say them, and see other dogs look surprised and envious, as wondering how she got so much education.But, indeed, it was not real education; it was only show: she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room when there was company, and by going with the children to Sunday-school and listening there; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over to herself many times, and so was able to keep it until there was a dogmatic gathering in the neighborhood, then she would get it off, and surprise and distress them all, from pocket-pup to mastiff, which rewarded her for all her trouble.If there was a stranger he was nearly sure to be suspicious, and when he got his breath again he would ask her what it meant.And she always told him.He was never expecting this but thought he would catch her; so when she told him, he was the one that looked ashamed, whereas he had thought it was going to be she.The others were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her, for they knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience.When she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right one; and that was natural, because, for one thing, she answered up so promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking, and for another thing, where could they find out whether it was right or not?For she was the only cultivated dog there was.By and by, when I was older, she brought home the word Unintellectual, one time, and worked it pretty hard all the week at different gatherings, making much unhappiness and despondency; and it was at this time that I noticed that during that week she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages, and flashed out a fresh definition every time, which showed me that she had more presence of mind than culture, though I said nothing, of course.She had one word which she always kept on hand, and ready, like a life-preserver, a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed overboard in a sudden way—that was the word Synonymous.When she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and its prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile, if there was a stranger there of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes, then he would come to, and by that time she would be away down wind on another tack, and not expecting anything; so when he’d hail and ask her to cash in, I (the only dog on the inside of her game) could see her canvas flicker a moment—but only just a moment—then it would belly out taut and full, and she would say, as calm as a summer’s day, “It’s synonymous with supererogation,” or some godless long reptile of a word like that, and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack, perfectly comfortable, you know, and leave that stranger looking profane and embarrassed, and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于短语也是这样。她会将一个听起来很不错的短语整个拖回家，然后在六个夜场和两个日场中表演。每次她都会给出全新的解释——她不得不这样做，因为她只关心那个短语，对它的意思却不感兴趣。而且她知道，无论如何，其他狗都无法挑出她的毛病。是的，她很棒！有了这个本领，她什么都不怕了。她相信，其他狗都很愚昧无知。她甚至把主人和客人在饭桌上笑谈的逸闻趣事记下来，而且照例将一个陈旧笑话的精彩之处嫁接到另一个笑话上去。当然这并不合适，也就没有什么可笑之处。当她讲笑话时，她发疯一般在地上打滚，大笑大叫，而我却看得出她在想为什么她说的笑话没有当初听到的那么有趣。然而这也无关紧要。其他的狗也在地上打起滚来，汪汪大叫。他们都暗自为自己没听懂而羞愧，从来没有想过错并不在自己身上，以及她讲的笑话并没有可笑之处。</td>
		<td class="en">And it was the same with phrases.She would drag home a whole phrase, if it had a grand sound, and play it six nights and two matinees, and explain it in a new way every time—which she had to, for all she cared for was the phrase; she wasn’t interested in what it meant, and knew those dogs hadn’t wit enough to catch her, anyway.Yes, she was a daisy!She got so she wasn’t afraid of anything, she had such confidence in the ignorance of those creatures.She even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut, where, of course, it didn’t fit and hadn’t any point; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering to herself why it didn’t seem as funny as it did when she first heard it.But no harm was done; the others rolled and barked too, privately ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point, and never suspecting that the fault was not with them and there wasn’t any to see.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由此，你可以看出她相当爱慕虚荣，而且很肤浅。不过，她也有优点。我觉得那些优点足以弥补她的缺点。她心胸宽广，和蔼友善。即使别人伤害了她，她也不记仇，总是坦然待之，很快就忘了。她教孩子们学习她友善的优点，而且从她身上，我们还学会了在危险时应该勇敢和灵敏，不逃跑。无论是朋友还是陌生人遇到危险，我们都要尽力去帮助，不要考虑自己会付出多大的代价。她对我们的教育不仅是言传，而且是身教。这是最好的方法，同时也是最有效持久的。嘿，她那些勇敢的事迹都是很光荣的。她可以说是一个战士，而且她对此表现得很谦虚——嗯，你不得不佩服她，也不得不效仿她。即使是查理士王小猎犬跟她在一起，也会相形见绌。因此，正如你所见，她拥有的不仅仅是学识。</td>
		<td class="en">You can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous character; still, she had virtues, and enough to make up, I think.She had a kind heart and gentle ways, and never harbored resentments for injuries done her, but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them; and she taught her children her kindly way, and from her we learned also to be brave and prompt in time of danger, and not to run away, but face the peril that threatened friend or stranger, and help him the best we could without stopping to think what the cost might be to us.And she taught us not by words only, but by example, and that is the best way and the surest and the most lasting.Why, the brave things she did, the splendid things!she was just a soldier; and so modest about it—well, you couldn’t help admiring her, and you couldn’t help imitating her; not even a King Charles spaniel could remain entirely despicable in her society.So, as you see, there was more to her than her education.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二章</td>
		<td class="en">Chapter II</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我终于长大了，然后被卖出去，让人带走了。之后我再也没见过她了。她很伤心，我也非常难过。我们都哭了，但是她尽力安慰我，说我们来到这个世界是为了一个明智而高尚的目的，我们必须尽自己的义务，不抱怨，而且要随遇而安。我们活着就要努力为他人造福，不要去计较结果，那不是我们该关心的事。她说，这样做的人不久就会在另一个世界里得到崇高美好的回报。我们动物虽然不会到另一个世界去，可是多做好事，不求报酬，就会给我们短暂的生命带来价值和尊严，而这些本身就是一种回报。这些道理是她每次跟孩子们去主日学校时学来的。她认真地将这些记下来，比记下其他的单词短语更加用心。为了她自己和我们，她认真地钻研过这些道理。从这里可以看出，她虽然很虚荣和轻浮，但是确实聪明体贴。</td>
		<td class="en">When I was well grown, at last, I was sold and taken away, and I never saw her again.She was broken-hearted, and so was I, and we cried; but she comforted me as well as she could, and said we were sent into this world for a wise and good purpose, and must do our duties without repining, take our life as we might find it, live it for the best good of others, and never mind about the results; they were not our affair.She said men who did like this would have a noble and beautiful reward by and by in another world, and although we animals would not go there, to do well and right without reward would give to our brief lives a worthiness and dignity which in itself would be a reward.She had gathered these things from time to time when she had gone to the Sunday-school with the children, and had laid them up in her memory more carefully than she had done with those other words and phrases; and she had studied them deeply, for her good and ours.One may see by this that she had a wise and thoughtful head, for all there was so much lightness and vanity in it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，我们互相道别，含着泪看了对方最后一眼。然后她说了最后一句话——我觉得她放在最后说是想让我记得更清楚些：“为了纪念我，当别人有危险的时候，不要只顾你自己，想想你的母亲，照她的做法去做。”</td>
		<td class="en">So we said our farewells, and looked our last upon each other through our tears; and the last thing she said—keeping it for the last to make me remember it the better, I think—was, “In memory of me, when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your mother, and do as she would do.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你觉得我能忘记那句话吗？不能。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的新家非常漂亮：一栋高大豪华的房子，里面有图画、精致的装饰品和高档的家具。没有一处是阴暗的，阳光倾泻下来，照耀着各种颜色的色彩，熠熠生辉。房子周围的场地很宽敞，还有一个大花园——啊，茵茵草地，参天大树，朵朵鲜花，真是说不完。我就像是他们家里的一个成员。他们都很喜欢我，宠爱我。而且他们没有给我取新名字，仍然我的那个旧名字——艾琳·马弗琳。这个名字对我来说很宝贵，因为这是我妈妈给我起的。她是从一首歌里面得知这个名字的。格雷夫妇也知道这首歌，而且说这是个美丽的名字。</td>
		<td class="en">It was such a charming home!—my new one; a fine great house, with pictures, and delicate decorations, and rich furniture, and no gloom anywhere, but all the wilderness of dainty colors lit up with flooding sunshine; and the spacious grounds around it, and the great garden—oh, greensward, and noble trees, and flowers, no end!And I was the same as a member of the family; and they loved me, and petted me, and did not give me a new name, but called me by my old one that was dear to me because my mother had given it me—Aileen Mavoureen.She got it out of a song; and the Grays knew that song, and said it was a beautiful name.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格雷太太三十岁，她那温柔可爱的样子简直难以想象。萨迪十岁，很像她妈妈，简直就是妈妈的微型翻版，很可爱。她背上垂着一条赤褐色的小辫子，穿着短短的连衣裙。还有一个一岁大的婴儿，长得胖嘟嘟的，还有酒窝。它很喜欢我，总是喜欢拽我的尾巴、拥抱我。它的笑声中洋溢着天真无邪的快乐。格雷先生三十八岁，身材修长，又高又帅，前额有点秃。他很机灵，动作敏捷，做事有条不紊，迅速果断，而且很冷静。他那轮廓分明的脸上好像闪现着一种严肃的机智。他是一位很有声望的科学家。我不知道“科学家”这个词是什么意思，但是我妈妈会知道怎么使用它，如何让其行之有效。她知道如何用它使一只捕鼠犬感到沮丧，让一只哈巴狗后悔自己的到来。但那还不是最好的词，最好的词是“实验室”。如果有实验室可以把所有狗脖子上表示缴税的颈圈取下来，那么我妈妈就可以组织一个托拉斯来办个实验室。实验室不是一本书或者一幅画，也不是大学校长的狗所说的那样，是一个让人洗手的地方——不对，那叫盥洗室。实验室是很不一样的，那里面堆满了罐子、瓶子、电器、电线和奇怪的机器。每个星期都有别的科学家过来，坐在那里，使用那些机器，进行讨论，做他们所谓的实验和发现。我也经常去那里，站在旁边听他们讲，试图学点东西。我这么做是为了我妈妈，为了纪念她。这对我而言是一种折磨，因为我意识到妈妈生活中失去的东西，意识到自己什么也没学到。尽管我很努力，我也不可能有所作为。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Gray was thirty, and so sweet and so lovely, you cannot imagine it; and Sadie was ten, and just like her mother, just a darling slender little copy of her, with auburn tails down her back, and short frocks; and the baby was a year old, and plump and dimpled, and fond of me, and never could get enough of hauling on my tail, and hugging me, and laughing out its innocent happiness; and Mr. Gray was thirty-eight, and tall and slender and handsome, a little bald in front, alert, quick in his movements, business-like, prompt, decided, unsentimental, and with that kind of trim-chiseled face that just seems to glint and sparkle with frosty intellectuality!He was a renowned scientist.I do not know what the word means, but my mother would know how to use it and get effects.She would know how to depress a rat-terrier with it and make a lap-dog look sorry he came.But that is not the best one; the best one was Laboratory.My mother could organize a Trust on that one that would skin the tax-collars off the whole herd.The laboratory was not a book, or a picture, or a place to wash your hands in, as the college president’s dog said—no, that is the lavatory; the laboratory is quite different, and is filled with jars, and bottles, and electrics, and wires, and strange machines; and every week other scientists came there and sat in the place, and used the machines, and discussed, and made what they called experiments and discoveries; and often I came, too, and stood around and listened, and tried to learn, for the sake of my mother, and in loving memory of her, although it was a pain to me, as realizing what she was losing out of her life and I gaining nothing at all; for try as I might, I was never able to make anything out of it at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时我趴在女主人工作室的地板上睡觉，她温柔地把我当做踏凳，知道这会让我开心，因为这也是一种爱抚。有时我在育儿室呆上一个小时，孩子们把我的毛弄得乱蓬蓬的，我也很开心。有时婴儿睡着了，而保姆要出去办事，我就在婴儿的床边看守一下。有时我跟萨迪在空地或者花园嬉戏玩耍，我们都累了时，我就在树阴下的草地上睡觉，而她就在那里看书。有时我去看望邻居的狗——因为在主人家不远处有几只非常不错的狗。其中有一只很帅、很客气、很优雅，那是一只叫罗宾·阿代尔的爱尔兰卷毛赛特猎犬，他跟我一样是长老会教友狗，他的主人是苏格兰牧师。</td>
		<td class="en">Other times I lay on the floor in the mistress’s work-room and slept, she gently using me for a foot-stool, knowing it pleased me, for it was a caress; other times I spent an hour in the nursery, and got well tousled and made happy; other times I watched by the crib there, when the baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby’s affairs; other times I romped and raced through the grounds and the garden with Sadie till we were tired out, then slumbered on the grass in the shade of a tree while she read her book; other times I went visiting among the neighbor dogs—for there were some most pleasant ones not far away, and one very handsome and courteous and graceful one, a curly-haired Irish setter by the name of Robin Adair, who was a Presbyterian like me, and belonged to the Scotch minister.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们家的仆人都对我很好，很喜欢我。因此，你可以看出，我的生活是很快乐的。世界上不会有比我更加快乐或者更懂得感恩的狗了。我敢这么说，因为这是事实。我竭尽全力做好我该做的事，以对得起妈妈对我的教导，尽最大的努力获得来到我身边的快乐。</td>
		<td class="en">The servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me, and so, as you see, mine was a pleasant life.There could not be a happier dog that I was, nor a gratefuler one.I will say this for myself, for it is only the truth: I tried in all ways to do well and right, and honor my mother’s memory and her teachings, and earn the happiness that had come to me, as best I could.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >过了不久，我生了只小狗。我高兴极了，我是幸福美满的。它是个可爱的小东西，走起路来摇摇摆摆；身上的毛又光滑又柔软，像天鹅绒一般；笨拙的小爪子长得很可爱，眼睛充满感情，脸蛋天真无邪。看见孩子们和他们的妈妈都喜欢它，宠爱它，为它的每一个小动作而欢呼，我感到很自豪。生活对于我来说，似乎太美好了。</td>
		<td class="en">By and by came my little puppy, and then my cup was full, my happiness was perfect.It was the dearest little waddling thing, and so smooth and soft and velvety, and had such cunning little awkward paws, and such affectionate eyes, and such a sweet and innocent face; and it made me so proud to see how the children and their mother adored it, and fondled it, and exclaimed over every little wonderful thing it did.It did seem to me that life was just too lovely to—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冬天来了。有一天，我在育儿室里看守着。也就是说，我在床上睡着了。婴儿也在小床上睡着了。小床和大床并排放在壁炉的旁边。小床的上面高高挂着一个半透明的罗纱帐子，你可以一眼看到里面。保姆出去了，只有我们俩在睡觉。一个火花从燃烧着的柴火中迸发出来，落在帐子的斜面上。我觉得那之后应该有过一阵平静的间歇，随后婴儿发出的尖叫声把我吵醒了。那时，火焰已经冲上了天花板。我来不及思考就吓得跳到地上，一秒钟之内就跑到门口了。可是在紧接着的半秒里，妈妈的离别教导在我的耳边响起，于是我又回到了床上。我把头伸进火焰中，衔住婴儿的腰带，用力将它拖了出去。我们俩在一片烟雾中跌倒在地上。我换个地方将它衔着，拖着尖叫的小家伙往门外跑，过了门道的转弯处，还继续拖着她跑。我又激动又快活又自豪，直到主人大叫了起来：</td>
		<td class="en">Then came the winter.One day I was standing a watch in the nursery.That is to say, I was asleep on the bed.The baby was asleep in the crib, which was alongside the bed, on the side next the fireplace.It was the kind of crib that has a lofty tent over it made of gauzy stuff that you can see through.The nurse was out, and we two sleepers were alone.A spark from the wood-fire was shot out, and it lit on the slope of the tent.I suppose a quiet interval followed, then a scream from the baby awoke me, and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling!Before I could think, I sprang to the floor in my fright, and in a second was half-way to the door; but in the next half-second my mother’s farewell was sounding in my ears, and I was back on the bed again.　I reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the waist-band, and tugged it along, and we fell to the floor together in a cloud of smoke; I snatched a new hold, and dragged the screaming little creature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall, and was still tugging away, all excited and happy and proud, when the master’s voice shouted:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“滚，你这该死的畜生！”我跳开来保护自己，但是他盛怒之下，动作非常快，追上我后就用他的手杖狠狠地打我。我惊恐地躲来躲去，最后，左前腿上挨了重重一棍。我尖叫着跌倒在地。在那一刻，我十分无助。另一棍又准备打下来，可是没有落下来，因为保姆拼命地叫了起来：“育儿室失火了！”然后主人就朝那边飞奔过去。我的其余骨头因此才得以保全下来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Begone you cursed beast!” and I jumped to save myself; but he was furiously quick, and chased me up, striking furiously at me with his cane, I dodging this way and that, in terror, and at last a strong blow fell upon my left foreleg, which made me shriek and fall, for the moment, helpless; the cane went up for another blow, but never descended, for the nurse’s voice rang wildly out, “The nursery’s on fire!” and the master rushed away in that direction, and my other bones were saved.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我真是痛极了。可是，没办法，我一分钟都不能浪费。主人随时可能回来，所以我瘸着三条腿，走到过道的另一头，那里有条黑黑的小楼梯通向阁楼。我听说阁楼上放着一些旧箱子之类的东西，而且很少有人去那儿。我设法爬到阁楼里，然后在黑暗中摸索着穿过一堆堆东西，藏在我能够找到的最隐秘的地方。在那里还害怕就太傻了，但是我还是很害怕，连呜咽也不敢，只能强忍着，虽然呜咽一下会很舒服，因为那样会减轻一点伤痛。但是我可以舔我的腿，那对我有一些帮助。</td>
		<td class="en">The pain was cruel, but, no matter, I must not lose any time; he might come back at any moment; so I limped on three legs to the other end of the hall, where there was a dark little stairway leading up into a garret where old boxes and such things were kept, as I had heard say, and where people seldom went.I managed to climb up there, then I searched my way through the dark among the piles of things, and hid in the secretest place I could find.It was foolish to be afraid there, yet still I was; so afraid that I held in and hardly even whimpered, though it would have been such a comfort to whimper, because that eases the pain, you know.But I could lick my leg, and that did some good.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >楼下吵闹了有半个小时，有叫喊的声音，有飞快的跑步声，然后又安静了下来。安静了好几分钟，这对我的精神很有帮助，因为我的恐惧情绪开始稳定下来。恐惧比伤痛更加糟糕——唉，糟糕得多。然后又传来一阵声音，把我吓得愣住了。他们在叫我——喊我的名字——在搜寻我。</td>
		<td class="en">For half an hour there was a commotion downstairs, and shoutings, and rushing footsteps, and then there was quiet again.Quiet for some minutes, and that was grateful to my spirit, for then my fears began to go down; and fears are worse than pains—oh, much worse.Then came a sound that froze me.They were calling me—calling me by name—hunting for me!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于距离关系，那声音变得有点低沉。但那并没有消除声音里的恐怖成分，这是我听过的最恐怖的声音。那些声音传到每个地方，沿着过道，传入所有的房间，传遍了两层楼以及地下室和地窖，又传到外面，越传越远——然后又传了回来，在整栋房子里又传一遍，我觉得它是永远不会停止的。但是最后，它终于停了。那时，漆黑的夜幕笼罩着顶楼的模糊光线好几个小时了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was muffled by distance, but that could not take the terror out of it, and it was the most dreadful sound to me that I had ever heard.It went all about, everywhere, down there: along the halls, through all the rooms, in both stories, and in the basement and the cellar; then outside, and farther and farther away—then back, and all about the house again, and I thought it would never, never stop.But at last it did, hours and hours after the vague twilight of the garret had long ago been blotted out by black darkness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在幸福的平静中，我的恐惧感渐渐消除了，然后我安心地睡着了。我睡得很好，但是在天亮之前我就醒了。我觉得很舒服，这时我可以想出个好主意了。我想到一个很好的主意，那就是从后面的楼梯爬下去，躲在地窖的门后面。黎明时分送冰人来了，当他在地窖里面往冰箱装冰时,我就趁机溜出去逃跑。然后我又整天躲着，天黑的时候再开始往前走。我可以到任何地方去，只要那里的人认不出我，不会把我交给我的主人。我现在几乎感到很高兴了，可是我突然间想起我的小狗崽，没有它的日子我该怎么过啊？</td>
		<td class="en">Then in that blessed stillness my terrors fell little by little away, and I was at peace and slept.It was a good rest I had, but I woke before the twilight had come again.I was feeling fairly comfortable, and I could think out a plan now.I made a very good one; which was, to creep down, all the way down the back stairs, and hide behind the cellar door, and slip out and escape when the iceman came at dawn, while he was inside filling the refrigerator; then I would hide all day, and start on my journey when night came; my journey to—well, anywhere where they would not know me and betray me to the master.I was feeling almost cheerful now; then suddenly I thought: Why, what would life be without my puppy!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那很令人失望。我意识到，我无计可施，还是得留下来：留下来，等着承受未知的一切——这轮不到我选择。这就是生活——正如我妈妈所说的。过了一会——唉，那叫喊声又响起了。我所有的担忧又回来了。我心里想着，主人是不会放过我的。我不知道自己到底做了什么让他对我充满怨恨，不肯饶恕我。我估计那应该是狗所不能理解而人却看得很清楚、很可怕的事吧。</td>
		<td class="en">That was despair.There was no plan for me; I saw that; I must stay where I was; stay, and wait, and take what might come—it was not my affair; that was what life is—my mother had said it.Then—well, then the calling began again!All my sorrows came back.I said to myself, the master will never forgive.I did not know what I had done to make him so bitter and so unforgiving, yet I judged it was something a dog could not understand, but which was clear to a man and dreadful.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们不停地喊——我觉得，就像喊了几天几夜似的。过了这么久，我又饥又渴，快被逼得发疯了，而且我知道我变得越来越虚弱。通常到了这种时候就会长时间睡觉，我便是这样。有一次我吓得醒了过来——那叫喊声就像在这阁楼里似的。那是真的，是萨迪的声音。她一边哭一边断断续续地喊我的名字。可怜的孩子。当我听到她说的那些话时，我高兴得不敢相信自己的耳朵。“回来我们这里吧——啊，回来我们这里吧，请原谅——没有你，我们实在太伤心了。”</td>
		<td class="en">They called and called—days and nights, it seemed to me.So long that the hunger and thirst near drove me mad, and I recognized that I was getting very weak.When you are this way you sleep a great deal, and I did.Once I woke in an awful fright—it seemed to me that the calling was right there in the garret!And so it was: it was Sadie’s voice, and she was crying; my name was falling from her lips all broken, poor thing, and I could not believe my ears for the joy of it when I heard her say:“Come back to us—oh, come back to us, and forgive-it is all so sad without our—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我感激得不禁叫了一声，接着萨迪便跌跌撞撞地穿过黑暗和废物堆，大声对家人喊道：“找到她了，找到她了！”</td>
		<td class="en">I broke in with SUCH a grateful little yelp, and the next moment Sadie was plunging and stumbling through the darkness and the lumber and shouting for the family to hear, “She’s found, she’s found!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来的日子，他们都对我好极了。萨迪和她妈妈还有仆人们——嘿，他们简直崇拜我了。他们似乎总是觉得给我铺的床不够好。至于食物，他们非要给我弄些野味和还不到时令的食物才觉得满意。每天都有朋友和邻居们过来听他们讲我的英勇事迹——他们是这样称呼那件事的，意思跟“农业”一样。我记得我妈妈有一次把这个词拖到狗窝里去，她就是那样解释的，但是她没有说农业是什么，只说那跟“壁内热”是同义词。格雷太太和萨迪给新来的客人讲我的英勇事迹，每天要讲十几遍，她们说我冒着生命危险救了婴儿的生命，我们俩身上的烧伤可作证明，于是客人们轮着抱我，抚摸我，称赞我。你可以看到萨迪和她妈妈眼里的那种自豪。当别人问起我的腿为什么会瘸了时，她们就会显得不好意思，并且赶快转换话题。有时候人家一直追问这个问题，我觉得她们好像快要哭了似的。</td>
		<td class="en">The days that followed—well, they were wonderful.The mother and Sadie and the servants—why, they just seemed to worship me.They couldn’t seem to make me a bed that was fine enough; and as for food, they couldn’t be satisfied with anything but game and delicacies that were out of season; and every day the friends and neighbors flocked in to hear about my heroism—that was the name they called it by, and it means agriculture.I remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once, and explaining it in that way, but didn’t say what agriculture was, except that it was synonymous with intramural incandescence; and a dozen times a day Mrs. Gray and Sadie would tell the tale to new-comers, and say I risked my life to save the baby’s, and both of us had burns to prove it, and then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about me, and you could see the pride in the eyes of Sadie and her mother; and when the people wanted to know what made me limp, they looked ashamed and changed the subject, and sometimes when people hunted them this way and that way with questions about it, it looked to me as if they were going to cry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这还不是我的全部荣耀，不是的。主人的朋友们来了，整整二十个最出色的人。他们把我带到实验室里去讨论，好像我是一种新发现似的。其中一个人说，一个不会说话的牲畜竟然能够这样做，真是了不起，这是他们所知道的本能的最好表现。但是我的主人激动地说：“这比本能高尚得多，这是理性。许多人虽然因为有理性，可能特许得到解救，和你我一起进入一个更好的世界，但是他们的理性比不上这只注定得不到永生的可怜的四足动物”；然后他又笑着说：“唉，你们瞧我——真是个讽刺！天啊，你们看我满肚子学问，可是我当时唯一的想法就是这只狗疯了，要把我的孩子弄死。要不是这只狗急中生智——这是理性，我告诉你们——我的孩子早就完蛋了！”</td>
		<td class="en">And this was not all the glory; no, the master’s friends came, a whole twenty of the most distinguished people, and had me in the laboratory, and discussed me as if I was a kind of discovery; and some of them said it was wonderful in a dumb beast, the finest exhibition of instinct they could call to mind; but the master said, with vehemence, “It’s far above instinct; it’s REASON, and many a man, privileged to be saved and go with you and me to a better world by right of its possession, has less of it than this poor silly quadruped that’s foreordained to perish”; and then he laughed, and said: “Why, look at me—I’m a sarcasm!bless you, with all my grand intelligence, the only think I inferred was that the dog had gone mad and was destroying the child, whereas but for the beast’s intelligence—it’s REASON, I tell you!—the child would have perished!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们不停地争论，而我就是他们争论的焦点。我希望我妈妈能够知道我得到了这种了不起的荣耀，这会使她很自豪的。</td>
		<td class="en">They disputed and disputed, and  I was the very center of subject of it all, and I wished my mother could know that this grand honor had come to me; it would have made her proud.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他们又讨论光学，他们是这样说的。他们讨论脑子受到一定程度的伤害是否会导致失明，但是大家的意见不一致，于是就说必须马上通过实验来证明。接下来他们又讨论植物，这让我很感兴趣，因为在夏天的时候，萨迪和我种过一些种子——你知道，我还帮她挖过坑呢。过了一些日子，那儿就会长出一株小灌木或一朵花。我不知道那是怎么发生的，可是它确实发生了，我希望我能够讲话——这样我便可以把这个告诉别人，让他们知道我懂得很多，而且我对这个问题很感兴趣。不过我对光学并不感兴趣，它很枯燥。当他们又回到这个话题上的时候，我觉得很无聊，于是睡着了。</td>
		<td class="en">Then they discussed optics, as they called it, and whether a certain injury to the brain would produce blindness or not, but they could not agree about it, and said they must test it by experiment by and by; and next they discussed plants, and that interested me, because in the summer Sadie and I had planted seeds—I helped her dig the holes, you know—and after days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there, and it was a wonder how that could happen; but it did, and I wished I could talk—I would have told those people about it and shown them how much I knew, and been all alive with the subject; but I didn’t care for the optics; it was dull, and when they came back to it again it bored me, and I went to sleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >春天很快就到了，阳光明媚，舒适而且可爱。那位亲切的妈妈和孩子们抚摸着我和小狗崽，跟我们道别，然后出门拜访亲戚去了。男主人没有陪我们一起玩，但是我们母子俩一起玩，而且玩得很开心。仆人们都很善良友好，因此 我们相处得很愉快，每天计算着日子等待女主人和孩子们的回来。</td>
		<td class="en">Pretty soon it was spring, and sunny and pleasant and lovely, and the sweet mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-by, and went away on a journey and a visit to their kin, and the master wasn’t any company for us, but we played together and had good times, and the servants were kind and friendly, so we got along quite happily and counted the days and waited for the family.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一天，那些人又来了，说现在要做实验，于是他们把小狗崽带到实验室去，我也瘸着三条腿跟过去。我觉得很自豪，因为小狗崽受人关注，我肯定很高兴。他们边讨论边做实验。小狗崽突然尖叫一声，他们把它放在地上，它便摇摇晃晃地走着，满头是血。主人拍着手大叫起来：</td>
		<td class="en">And one day those men came again, and said, now for the test, and they took the puppy to the laboratory, and I limped three-leggedly along, too, feeling proud, for any attention shown to the puppy was a pleasure to me, of course.They discussed and experimented, and then suddenly the puppy shrieked, and they set him on the floor, and he went staggering around, with his head all bloody, and the master clapped his hands and shouted:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看，我赢了——认输吧你们！它就像蝙蝠一样瞎！”</td>
		<td class="en">“There, I’ve won—confess it!He’s as blind as a bat!”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“确实如此——你证实了你的理论。从此，受苦的人类应该感谢你。”他们围着他，热情地握着他的手，感谢他，称赞他。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s so—you’ve proved your theory, and suffering humanity owes you a great debt from henceforth,” and they crowded around him, and wrung his hand cordially and thankfully, and praised him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是我几乎什么也没看到，什么也没听到，因为我马上朝我的小宝贝跑过去，紧紧地依偎着它，舔它的血。它把头靠在我头上，轻声地呜咽着。我知道，虽然它看不见我，但是对于痛苦万分的它来说，能感觉到妈妈的抚摸，是一种安慰。不久它就倒了下去，柔软的小鼻子伏在地面上。它安安静静的，再也没有动弹了。</td>
		<td class="en">But I hardly saw or heard these things, for I ran at once to my little darling, and snuggled close to it where it lay, and licked the blood, and it put its head against mine, whimpering softly, and I knew in my heart it was a comfort to it in its pain and trouble to feel its mother’s touch, though it could not see me.Then it dropped down, presently, and its little velvet nose rested upon the floor, and it was still, and did not move any more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >主人很快就停止了讨论，按铃叫男仆进来，说：“把它埋在花园那头的角落里。”说完又继续讨论。我一路跟着男仆小跑过去，心里很高兴，很感激，因为我知道，我的小狗崽已经不痛了，因为它睡着了。我们一直走到花园最远的那一头。夏天的时候，我曾经和孩子们、保姆还有我的小狗崽在大榆树的树荫下玩耍。男仆在那儿挖了个坑，我知道他准备把小狗崽种在坑里。我很高兴，因为我知道它还会长出来的，长成一条很英俊的狗，就像罗宾·阿代尔那样。女主人和孩子们回来后，会大吃一惊的。因此我尽力帮他挖，但是我那瘸腿很僵硬，帮不上什么忙。你知道，你得有两条腿才能帮忙，不然就毫无用处。男仆挖好坑，埋好了小罗宾后，拍了拍我的头，眼里含着泪说：“可怜的小狗，你可是救过他的孩子啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">Soon the master stopped discussing a moment, and rang in the footman, and said, “Bury it in the far corner of the garden,” and then went on with the discussion, and I trotted after the footman, very happy and grateful, for I knew the puppy was out of its pain now, because it was asleep.We went far down the garden to the farthest end, where the children and the nurse and the puppy and I used to play in the summer in the shade of a great elm, and there the footman dug a hole, and I saw he was going to plant the puppy, and I was glad, because it would grow and come up a fine handsome dog, like Robin Adair, and be a beautiful surprise for the family when they came home; so I tried to help him dig, but my lame leg was no good, being stiff, you know, and you have to have two, or it is no use.When the footman had finished and covered little Robin up, he patted my head, and there were tears in his eyes, and he said: “Poor little doggie, you saved HIS child!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我观察了整整两个星期，可是他并没有长出来。在第二个星期里，一种恐惧感偷偷袭上我的心头。我觉得事情有点可怕。我不知道到底发生了什么事，可是这种恐惧让我很不安。即使仆人们拿最好的食物给我吃，我也吃不下。他们爱抚着我，甚至晚上也过来，哭着说，“可怜的小狗——别守在这里了，回去吧；别让我们难受了！”这些话更加把我吓坏了，让我更加确定有事情发生了。我虚弱极了。从昨天开始，我就再也站不起来了。一小时之前，仆人们望着正在西下的夕阳，夜里的寒气悄然袭来。他们说了些我听不懂的话，但是那些话却让我感到心寒。</td>
		<td class="en">I have watched two whole weeks, and he doesn’t come up!This last week a fright has been stealing upon me.I think there is something terrible about this.I do not know what it is, but the fear makes me sick, and I cannot eat, though the servants bring me the best of food; and they pet me so, and even come in the night, and cry, and say, “Poor doggie—do give it up and come home; DON’t break our hearts!” and all this terrifies me the more, and makes me sure something has happened.And I am so weak; since yesterday I cannot stand on my feet anymore.And within this hour the servants, looking toward the sun where it was sinking out of sight and the night chill coming on, said things I could not understand, but they carried something cold to my heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那几个可怜的人啊！他们没料想到。他们明天早上就回家了，到时肯定会问起那只表现勇敢的小狗。我们当中有谁敢对他们说出真相啊：‘那个卑微的小东西去了畜生们不能得到永生的地方。’”</td>
