"千块皮","Allerleirauh"
"很久很久以前，有一位国王，他的妻子长着一头金黄色的头发，她是那么的美丽，举世无双。可是，她突然病倒了。她感到自己快要不行了，便把国王叫到身边，说：“我死后，如果你要再娶一位王后的话，不能娶没我漂亮的女人，她得长着一头像我这样的金发才行，这一点你必须答应我。”国王答应她之后，王后便合上双眼去世了。","There was once on a time a King who had a wife with golden hair, and she was so beautiful that her equal was not to be found on earth.It came to pass that she lay ill, and as she felt that she must soon die, she called the King and said, “If thou wishest to marry again after my death, take no one who is not quite as beautiful as I am, and who has not just such golden hair as I have: this thou must promise me.”And after the King had promised her this she closed her eyes and died."
"此后很长时间国王都沉浸在悲痛中，他也没有考虑再娶一位王后的问题。最后，国王的大臣们说：“这样可不行啊。国王必须得结婚，这样，我们才能有位王后。”国王派人四处去寻找一位姑娘，她要和死去的王后一样漂亮。然而，他们找不到那样的姑娘，即使有人和王后一样漂亮，可她的头发又不是金黄色的。使者们只得无功而返。","For a long time the King could not be comforted, and had no thought of taking another wife.At length his councillors said, “There is no help for it, the King must marry again, that we may have a Queen.”And now messengers were sent about far and wide, to seek a bride who equalled the late Queen in beauty.In the whole world, however, none was to be found, and even if one had been found, still there would have been no one who had such golden hair.So the messengers came home as they went."
"国王有一个女儿，她和她死去的母亲一样漂亮，也长着同样的金黄色头发。当女孩长大后，有一次，国王打量着她，发现她和他死去的妻子一模一样，国王忽然对她产生了强烈的爱意。于是，王国对大臣们说：“我要娶我的女儿为妻，只有她才和死去的王后一样美丽。不然，我找不到像死去的王后一样美丽的新娘了。”听到这话，大臣们都震惊了，他们说：“上帝禁止父亲娶女儿为妻。你若犯下这等罪孽，不会有好结果，我们的王国也会跟着遭到毁灭。”","Now the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had the same golden hair.When she was grown up the King looked at her one day, and saw that in every respect she was like his late wife, and suddenly felt a violent love for her.Then he spoke to his councillors, “I will marry my daughter, for she is the counterpart of my late wife, otherwise I can find no bride who resembles her.”When the councillors heard that, they were shocked, and said, “God has forbidden a father to marry his daughter, no good can come from such a crime, and the kingdom will be involved in the ruin.”"
"公主知道父亲的决定后，更加震惊，但她希望能改变父亲的想法。于是，公主对国王说：“在我完成你的心愿前，我要三件衣裳：一件要如太阳般金光灿灿，一件要如月亮般皎洁如银，一件要如星星般璀璨明亮。除此之外，我还要一件斗篷，它要用一千块不同种类的动物皮毛缝制而成，我们国家的每种动物都要献出一块皮子。”公主心想：“这不可能做得到，只有这样，我才能阻止父亲的这种不良企图。”然而，国王并没有就此罢休。他命全国最手巧的女子缝制这三件衣裳：一件如太阳般金光灿灿，一件如月亮般皎洁如银，一件如星星般璀璨明亮。他还命猎手们把全国的每种动物都捉一只来，从它们身上取下一块皮，用这些皮制成一件千块皮的斗篷。最后，一切都准备妥当，国王命人拿来斗篷，把它放在公主面前，说：“我们明天举行婚礼。”","The daughter was still more shocked when she became aware of her father’s resolution, but hoped to turn him from his design.Then she said to him, “Before I fulfil your wish, I must have three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars; besides this, I wish for a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur and hair joined together, and one of every kind of animal in your kingdom must give a piece of his skin for it.”But she thought, “To get that will be quite impossible, and thus I shall divert my father from his wicked intentions.”The King, however, did not give it up, and the cleverest maidens in his kingdom had to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars, and his huntsmen had to catch one of every kind of animal in the whole of his kingdom, and take from it a piece of its skin, and out of these was made a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur.At length, when all was ready, the King caused the mantle to be brought, spread it out before her, and said, “The wedding shall be tomorrow.”"
"公主看到没希望改变国王的心意后，便决定离家出走。夜里，所有人都睡着了，公主起身，取出三件宝贝：一枚金戒指、一个金制的小纺轮和一架金制卷线车。她把那三件如太阳、月亮和星星般的衣裳装进一个坚果壳里，穿上那件用各种兽皮制成的斗篷，然后又用烟灰涂黑了脸和双手。她做完祷告后，就出发了。她整整走了一晚上，终于来到一片大森林里。公主很疲惫，便钻进一个树洞里睡着了。","When, therefore, the King’s daughter saw that there was no longer any hope of turning her father’s heart, she resolved to run away from him.In the night whilst every one was asleep, she got up, and took three different things from her treasures, a golden ring, a golden spinning-wheel, and a golden reel.The three dresses of the sun, moon, and stars she put into a nutshell, put on her mantle of all kinds of fur, and blackened her face and hands with soot.Then she commended herself to God, and went away, and walked the whole night until she reached a great forest.And as she was tired, she got into a hollow tree, and fell asleep."
"太阳升起来了，公主还在睡觉。正午时分公主仍然没醒。碰巧，森林的主人——当地的国王，来森林里狩猎。国王的猎狗来到这棵树前，它们嗅了嗅，便围着树又跑又叫。国王对猎人们说：“去看看树洞里藏着什么野兽。”猎人们照国王吩咐的做了。他们回来报告说：“树洞里躺着一只特别漂亮的动物，我们以前从未见过这种动物。它的皮是由一千块各种各样的兽皮组成的，它还在睡觉呢。”国王说：“你们要活捉它，然后把它绑到车上带回去。”公主被猎人们抓住后就醒了，她惊恐极了，朝他们喊：“我是一个可怜的女孩，父母抛弃了我，你们可怜可怜我，带我一起走吧。”他们说道：“千块皮，你可以到御膳房去帮忙。跟我们走吧，你就在那儿打扫打扫卫生吧。”他们把公主放在车上，把她带回了宫殿。他们朝她指了指楼梯下的一间小屋，那小屋黑漆漆的不见天日。他们对她说：“小毛孩，你就住在这里吧。”然后女孩被领进御膳房。她在那儿挑柴提水、打扫壁炉、褪鸡毛、择菜、扫灰，所有的脏活她都干。","The sun rose, and she slept on, and she was still sleeping when it was full day.Then it so happened that the King to whom this forest belonged, was hunting in it.When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran barking round about it.The King said to the huntsmen, “Just see what kind of wild beast has hidden itself in there.”The huntsmen obeyed his order, and when they came back they said, “A wondrous beast is lying in the hollow tree; we have never before seen one like it.Its skin is fur of a thousand different kinds, but it is lying asleep.”Said the King, “See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the carriage, and we will take it with us.”When the huntsmen laid hold of the maiden, she awoke full of terror, and cried to them, “I am a poor child, deserted by father and mother; have pity on me, and take me with you.”Then said they, “Allerleirauh, thou wilt be useful in the kitchen, come with us, and thou canst sweep up the ashes.”So they put her in the carriage, and took her home to the royal palace.There they pointed out to her a closet under the stairs, where no daylight entered, and said, “Hairy animal, there canst thou live and sleep.”Then she was sent into the kitchen, and there she carried wood and water, swept the hearth, plucked the fowls, picked the vegetables, raked the ashes, and did all the dirty work."
"“千块皮”在那里生活了很长时间，她的处境很悲惨。唉，漂亮的公主，你现在怎么变成这样！一天，王宫举行宴会，女孩对厨子说：“我可以到楼上去看看吗？我就呆在门外。”厨子答道：“可以，你去吧。但你得在半小时内回来打扫壁炉。”于是，女孩带着油灯回到她的小屋里。她脱下兽皮，洗掉脸上和手上的烟灰，她全部的美丽又露了出来。然后，她打开坚果，拿出那件像太阳一样金光闪闪的衣裳。她穿上那件衣裳就上楼出席宴会了。大家都为她让路，没人认识她，大家都觉得她是位公主。国王走上前来，拉住她的手，同她翩翩起舞，心里暗想：“我从来没见过这么漂亮的姑娘！”舞跳完了，女孩对国王行了屈膝礼。国王四处找她时，她已消失不见了，没人知道她去哪了。国王叫来王宫门前站岗的守卫问话，可他们都没见过她。","Allerleirauh lived there for a long time in great wretchedness.Alas, fair princess, what is to become of thee now!It happened, however, that one day a feast was held in the palace, and she said to the cook, “May I go up stairs for a while, and look on?I will place myself outside the door.”The cook answered, “Yes, go, but you must be back here in half-an-hour to sweep the hearth.”Then she took her oil-lamp, went into her den, put off her fur-dress, and washed the soot off her face and hands, so that her full beauty once more came to light.And she opened the nut, and took out her dress which shone like the sun, and when she had done that she went up to the festival, and every one made way for her, for no one knew her, and thought no otherwise than that she was a king’s daughter.The King came to meet her, gave his hand to her, and danced with her, and thought in his heart, “My eyes have never yet seen any one so beautiful!”When the dance was over she curtsied, and when the King looked round again she had vanished, and none knew whither.The guards who stood outside the palace were called and questioned, but no one had seen her."
"女孩跑进小屋里，迅速脱下衣裳，又在脸上和手上抹上烟灰，穿上那件兽皮斗篷，她又变成了“千块皮”。公主回到御膳房，正要打扫灰尘，厨子说：“那个活明天再做吧，帮我给国王做碗汤，我也上楼去看看。不过，不要把头发掉到汤里，否则，你以后就没饭吃了。”厨子走后，“千块皮”便为国王准备汤，她尽最大努力为国王做了一锅面包汤。汤做好后，她从小屋里拿来那枚金戒指，放进给国王做的那碗汤里。舞会结束后，国王命人把汤端来。国王很喜欢喝，他觉得自己从来没喝过这么好喝的汤。可是，汤喝光后，国王看到碗底有一枚金戒指，他想不出戒指是怎么跑到碗里的。于是，他命厨子过来见他。听到命令后，厨子很害怕，他对“千块皮”说：“你一定是把头发掉进汤里了。要真是这样，我非收拾你一顿。”厨子来到国王面前，国王问他，这碗汤是谁做的？厨子答道：“是我做的。”国王说：“不可能，这汤比平时的好喝多了，做法也不一样。”厨子说：“我如实招了，这汤不是我做的，是千块皮做的。”国王说：“去叫她来见我。”","She had, however, run into her little den, had quickly taken off her dress, made her face and hands black again, put on the fur-mantle, and again was Allerleirauh.And now when she went into the kitchen, and was about to get to her work and sweep up the ashes, the cook said, “Leave that alone till morning, and make me the soup for the King; I, too, will go upstairs awhile, and take a look; but let no hairs fall in, or in future thou shalt have nothing to eat.”So the cook went away, and Allerleirauh made the soup for the king, and made bread soup and the best she could, and when it was ready she fetched her golden ring from her little den, and put it in the bowl in which the soup was served.When the dancing was over, the King had his soup brought and ate it, and he liked it so much that it seemed to him he had never tasted better.But when he came to the bottom of the bowl, he saw a golden ring lying, and could not conceive how it could have got there.Then he ordered the cook to appear before him.The cook was terrified when he heard the order, and said to Allerleirauh, “Thou hast certainly let a hair fall into the soup, and if thou hast, thou shalt be beaten for it.”When he came before the King the latter asked who had made the soup?The cook replied, “I made it.”But the King said, “That is not true, for it was much better than usual, and cooked differently.”He answered, “I must acknowledge that I did not make it, it was made by the rough animal.”The King said, “Go and bid it come up here.”"
"“千块皮”来到国王面前，国王问道：“你是谁？”“我是一个没爹没娘的可怜的女孩。”国王继续问道：“你在王宫里做什么？”公主答到：“我什么也不擅长，只是被人呼来喝去。”国王又问：“碗里的那枚戒指你从哪儿弄来的？”女孩答道：“我不知道戒指的事情。”国王没问出什么东西，只得放她回去了。","When Allerleirauh came, the King said, “Who art thou?”“I am a poor girl who no longer has any father or mother.”He asked further, “Of what use art thou in my palace?”She answered, “I am good for nothing but to have boots thrown at my head.”He continued, “Where didst thou get the ring which was in the soup?”She answered, “I know nothing about the ring.”So the King could learn nothing, and had to send her away again."
"不久，王宫又举行宴会，“千块皮”还是像上次一样，恳请厨子让她去看看。厨子答道：“好的，不过你要在半小时之内回来，再给国王做一碗他很爱喝的面包汤。”于是，公主跑回小屋，匆忙地洗干净脸和手，然后从坚果壳里拿出那件皎洁如银的衣裳，把它穿在身上。然后，她走到楼上，好像一位公主。国王走上前来，很高兴能再次看到她。舞会一开始，他们就一起跳了起来。可是，舞会一结束，她又快速消失了，国王不知道她去哪了。她迅速跑回小屋，又打扮成毛孩的模样，然后她回到御膳房给国王准备面包汤。厨子上楼去后，她拿来金制小纺轮，把它放到碗里，汤盖住了小纺轮。汤端到了国王面前。跟上次一样，国王很喜欢喝这碗汤，于是他命人叫来厨子。跟上次一样，厨子不得不承认，这碗汤是“千块皮”做的。“千块皮”又来到国王面前，可她依然说自己什么也不擅长，只是被呼来喝去，还说她不知道小纺轮的事情。","After a while, there was another festival, and then, as before, Allerleirauh begged the cook for leave to go and look on.He answered, “Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour, and make the King the bread soup which he so much likes.”Then she ran into her den, washed herself quickly, and took out of the nut the dress which was as silvery as the moon, and put it on.Then she went up and was like a princess, and the King stepped forward to meet her, and rejoiced to see her once more, and as the dance was just beginning they danced it together.But when it was ended, she again disappeared so quickly that the King could not observe where she went.She, however, sprang into her den, and once more made herself a hairy animal, and went into the kitchen to prepare the bread soup.When the cook had gone up stairs, she fetched the little golden spinning-wheel, and put it in the bowl so that the soup covered it.Then it was taken to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as before, and had the cook brought, who this time likewise was forced to confess that Allerleirauh had prepared the soup.Allerleirauh again came before the King, but she answered that she was good for nothing else but to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all about the little golden spinning-wheel."

"从前，有一位年轻的猎人，他去森林里埋伏着等待猎物。他精神饱满、心情愉悦，正当他一路上用树叶吹着小曲，渐行渐远的时候，偶遇一位长相丑陋、干瘪的老太婆，老太婆对他说：“你好啊，亲爱的猎人，你真的好快乐、好满足呀，可我正忍饥挨饿呢，施舍点啥给我吧。”猎人很同情这个可怜的老人，摸了摸口袋，把能给的东西都给了她。他正打算继续赶路，老太婆却拦住了他，说道：“亲爱的猎人，你听我说，你这么善良，我要送你一件礼物作为回报。你只管继续赶路，不久就会看到一棵大树，树上有九只小鸟，小鸟们用爪子抓着一件披风，互相争抢，你拿猎枪朝它们中间开一枪，它们就会把披风掉落给你，其中一只鸟儿会被击中，坠地而死。你带走那披风，它是件许愿披风，当你披上它时，只需想想要去的地方，一眨眼的功夫你就到那儿了。挖出那只死鸟儿的心，整个地吞下去，那样的话你每天一早起床后，都会发现枕头下面有一块金条。”猎人谢过睿智的老太太，心想：“如果真能实现的话，她许诺的可都是大美事啊。”                                                  猎人走了大约一百步，当真听到在他头顶上方的树枝之间，鸟儿叽叽喳喳地尖叫个不停，他抬头一望，只见一群小鸟正用鸟喙、爪子撕扯着一块布，它们边拽那布，边互相打斗，好像个个都想独占它。猎人喊道：“哈，这太好了，还真说来就来啊，跟老太婆所预言的一样啊！”于是，他拿下肩上的猎枪，瞄准它们后朝当中开了一枪，顿时羽毛四处纷飞。鸟儿们立即尖叫着飞走了，可是有一只坠下来死掉了，那件披风也同时落了下来。然后猎人就按老太婆指导的做了，切开鸟儿，找到心脏，一口吞了下去，并把披风拿回了家。","There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in wait.He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither, whistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him and said, “Good day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and contented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an alms.”The huntsman had compassion on the poor old creature, felt in his pocket, and gave her what he could afford.He was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and said, “Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you; I will make you a present in return for your kindness.Go on your way now, but in a little while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting which have a cloak in their claws, and are plucking at it; take your gun and shoot into the midst of them, they will let the cloak fall down to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down dead.Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing cloak; when you throw it over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain place, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye.Take out the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning early, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your pillow.”The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself, “Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come true.”And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard in the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he looked up and saw there a crowd of birds who were tearing a piece of cloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as if each wanted to have it all to himself.“Well,” said the huntsman, “this is wonderful, it has really come to pass just as the old wife foretold!” and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about.The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time.Then the huntsman did as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the heart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him."
"第二天早上，猎人醒来时想到了老太婆说的话，便想看看是否真的实现了。当他抬起枕头，一块金灿灿的金条映入眼帘，接下来的清晨他又得到了一块金子，以后的每天清晨他起床后都是如此。他慢慢收集了成堆的金子，可最后他心想：“我要是就这样呆在家里的话，有这么多金子又有什么用呢？我要出去见见世面。”","Next morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he wished to see if it also had been fulfilled.When he lifted up the pillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found another, and so it went on, every time he got up.He gathered together a heap of gold, but at last he thought, “Of what use is all my gold to me if I stay at home? I will go forth and see the world.”"
"于是，他辞别了父母，背上包袱、扛上猎枪就去闯世界了。一天，他穿过一片茂密的森林，走到森林尽头时，映入眼帘的是平原上矗立着的一座宏伟的城堡。一个老太太和一个美丽得令人惊讶的少女正站在那里朝窗外张望。这老太太其实是个巫婆，她对姑娘说：“从森林里走出来的那个人，身上有件奇异的宝贝，我们要把它偷来，我亲爱的女儿，那宝贝与我们才更相配呢。他曾吃了一颗鸟心，因此每天清晨他的枕头下面都会出现一块金条。”老巫婆告诉女儿要怎样做才可以拿到，哪部分需要她做，最后露出凶狠的目光威胁她道：“要是你敢不按我说的做，我就让你好看。”当猎人走近后，一下就看到了那位少女，他自言自语道：“我已经走了这么久的路，真该休息一下了，到那座漂亮的宫殿里去吧。反正我有的是钱。”","He then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman’s pouch and gun, and went out into the world.It came to pass, that one day he travelled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him stood a fine castle.An old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of the windows.The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the maiden, “There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his body, we must filch it from him, my dear daughter, it is more suitable for us than for him.He has a bird’s heart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning under his pillow.”She told her what she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with angry eyes, “And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the worse for you.”Now when the huntsman came nearer he descried the maiden, and said to himself, “I have travelled about for such a long time, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle. I have certainly money enough.”"
"但是，猎人想进入宫殿的真正原因，是他被那位漂亮的姑娘迷住了。","Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of the pretty girl."
"他走进这座大房子，受到了热情而又礼貌的接待。很快他就深深爱上了这个小巫女，从此不再想其他事情，眼里只有她关注的东西，只做她要求做的事情。于是，老巫婆说：“现在我们得把鸟心取出来了，他永远都不会想念它的。”她配制了一种药水，准备妥当后，倒进杯子里，让女儿端到猎人面前。姑娘照做了，说道：“噢，亲爱的，为我喝干了它吧。”因此，猎人拿起杯子一饮而尽，随后吐出了鸟心。姑娘不得不悄悄地拿走鸟心，吞了下去，因为是老巫婆吩咐她这么做的。自那以后，猎人再也没在枕头下面找到过金子，取而代之的是金子跑到姑娘的枕头下面了，老巫婆每天清晨都会从她那儿把金子取走。可由于猎人被爱情冲昏了头，他就什么都没多想，只想着能和姑娘共度时光。","He entered the house, and was well received and courteously entertained.Before long he was so much in love with the young witch that he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as she saw them, and did what she desired.The old woman then said, “Now we must have the bird’s heart, he will never miss it.”She prepared a drink, and when it was ready, poured it into a cup and gave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the huntsman.She did so, saying, “Now, my dearest, drink to me.”So he took the cup, and when he had swallowed the draught, he brought up the heart of the bird.The girl had to take it away secretly and swallow it herself, for the old woman would have it so.Thence forward he found no more gold under his pillow, but it lay instead under that of the maiden, from whence the old woman fetched it away every morning; but he was so much in love and so befooled, that he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with the girl."
"老巫婆又说：“我们拥有鸟心了，但是我们还必须把他那件许愿披风拿来。”姑娘答道：“我们就把披风留给他吧，他都已经失去钱财了啊。”老巫婆很生气，说道：“这件披风可是件了不起的宝贝呀，全世界都很罕见。我一定要得到它！”","Then the old witch said, “We have the bird’s heart, but we must also take the wishing cloak away from him.”The girl answered, “We will leave him that, he has lost his wealth.”The old woman was angry and said, “Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found in this world. I must and will have it！”"
"她打了女孩几下，还警告她说，如果她不服从会遭殃的。于是，姑娘按老巫婆的命令行事，她站到窗前，望向遥远的国度，看起来特别伤心。猎人问道：“你为什么这么伤心地站在那儿啊？”姑娘回答说：“唉，亲爱的，远处那边有一座石榴石山，山上有很多珍贵的宝石。我渴望得到那些宝石，以至于每当想起来就感到很伤心，可谁又能得到呢？只有鸟儿才行，它们能飞到那里去，任何人类都做不到啊。”猎人说：“除此之外，你没别的事情感到伤心了吧？我很快就能帮你解除心结。”","She gave the girl several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with her.So she did the old woman’s bidding, placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful.The huntsman asked, “Why dost thou stand there so sorrowfully?”“Ah, my beloved,” was her answer, “over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain, where the precious stones grow.I long for them so much that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them?Only the birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.”“Hast thou nothing else to complain of?” said the huntsman, “I will soon remove that burden from heart.”"
"说完，他将姑娘拉到他的披风下面，许愿到石榴石山去，一眨眼的功夫他们就到了石榴石山上。宝石周边闪闪发光，怎么看都让人觉得是种享受，他们聚攒了其中很多最好最贵的宝石。这时，老巫婆施起了巫术，使猎人感觉眼皮越来越沉，昏昏欲睡起来。他对姑娘说：“我们坐下来休息一会儿吧，我很疲惫，都站不稳了。”于是他们坐下来，他将头靠在姑娘的双腿上，很快就睡着了。猎人正睡着的时候，姑娘从他身上解下披风，裹在自己身上，拿起石榴石和宝石，就许愿回家了。","With that he drew her under his mantle, wished himself on the Garnet Mountain, and in the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together.Precious stones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see them, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them.Now, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the eyes of the huntsman should become heavy.He said to the maiden, “We will sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer stand on my feet.”Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap, and fell asleep.When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle from his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets and stones, and wished herself back at home with them."
"猎人睡醒后，发现心上人背叛了他，把他独自一人留在这荒山野岭上。他叹道：“唉，世上竟有这么背信弃义的事情！”猎人既担心又伤心地坐在那里，不知如何是好。可是，这石榴石山的主人其实是一些可怕野蛮的巨人，他们就在这山上居住和生活，猎人才刚坐了一会儿就看到三个巨人朝他走过来，于是他躺在地上，假装正在沉睡的样子。巨人们走到猎人面前，第一个巨人用脚踢踢他，说：“是什么东西蜷缩在这里？”第二个巨人说：“用脚踩死他。”可第三个巨人却说：“那还真不值得费那个劲啊；放过他吧，他不会留在这儿的；等他爬得再高一点，爬到山顶上，云彩会把他卷住带走的。”这么说着，三个巨人从他身边走了过去。可猎人却留心听到了他们的谈话，巨人们刚一走开，他就爬起来，向山顶攀登。当他到了山顶刚坐了一会儿，一朵云彩就向他飘来，卷起猎人将他带走了，在天上漂游了很久。后来，云彩越来越低，飘落在四面围墙的一大片圆白菜园里，这样猎人就缓缓地落在长着圆白菜之类蔬菜的地上了。猎人四处张望了一下，说：“要是有点东西吃就好了！我太饿了，过段时间还会更饿。可我看这里既没有苹果也没有梨子，什么水果都没有，除了圆白菜还是圆白菜。”最后，他心想：“必要时我就吃些菜叶子吧，虽然味道不怎么样，可至少能充饥呀。”想到这里，他挑了一个长得不错的圆白菜吃起来，可没等咽下几口，他就觉得很奇怪，感觉自己和以前大不相同了。他身上长出了四条腿，一个大大的脑袋和两只厚耳朵，他惊骇地发现，自己变成了一头毛驴。他的饥饿感仍随着每一分钟而增长，因为他现在是只毛驴，多汁的菜叶子正合他的胃口，他便津津有味地大吃起来。最后，他碰到了一种不同的圆白菜，刚一吃下去，他再次感到自己发生了变化，他又恢复了之前人的模样。","But when the huntsman had had his sleep out and awoke, and perceived that his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild mountain, he said, “Oh, what treachery there is in the world!” and sat down there in care and sorrow, not knowing what to do.But the mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt thereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long before he saw three of them coming towards him, so he lay down as if he were sunk in a deep sleep.Then the giants came up, and the first kicked him with his foot and said, “What sort of an earthworm is lying curled up here?""The second said, “Step upon him and kill him.”But the third said, “That would indeed be worth your while; just let him live, he cannot remain here; and when he climbs higher, toward the summit of of the mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him and bear him away.”So saying they passed by.But the huntsman had paid heed to their words, and as soon as they were gone, he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain, and when he had sat there a while, a cloud floated towards him, caught him up, carried him away, and travelled about for a long time in the heavens.Then it sank lower, and let itself down on a great cabbage garden, girt round by walls, so that he came softly to the ground on cabbages and vegetables.Then the huntsman looked about him and said, “If I had but something to eat!I am so hungry, and my hunger will increase in course of time; but I see here neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort of fruit, everywhere nothing but cabbages,” but at length he thought, “At a pinch I can eat some of the leaves, they do not taste particularly good, but they will refresh me.”With that he picked himself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it, but scarcely had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite different.Four legs grew on him, a large head and two thick ears, and he saw with horror that he was changed into an ass.Still as his hunger increased every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his present nature, he went on eating with great zest.At last he arrived at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had swallowed it, he again felt a change, and reassumed his former human shape."
"于是猎人躺下来，他要睡一觉以恢复体力。第二天早上醒来时，他摘下一头坏圆白菜和另外一头好圆白菜，暗自心想：“这可以帮我拿回自己的东西，还能惩罚她们的欺骗。”于是，他带上圆白菜爬过了围墙，上路去寻找他心上人居住的城堡了。走了大约两三天，他终于幸运地找到了那座城堡。他把脸涂黑，就算是自己的母亲也认不出他来，随后便到城堡去恳求借宿一夜：“我累得一步都走不动了。”巫婆问道：“乡下人，你是谁呀，你是干什么的呢？”“我是一个国王的信使，被派去寻找天底下最美味的蔬菜。我很幸运地找到了它，正随身带着呢。可火辣辣的太阳让这美味的圆白菜快要枯萎了，我都不知道能不能把它再带走远一步了。”老巫婆听说了如此精致的蔬菜后，立即贪吃起来，便说道：“亲爱的乡下人，让我尝一下这美妙的蔬菜吧。”他答道：“为什么不呢？我带了两棵呢，可以给你一棵。”他打开包袱，把那棵坏圆白菜递给了老巫婆。老巫婆错误地一点儿也没有起疑心，她看着美味的蔬菜直流口水，赶紧拿去厨房，亲自调制了一下。当调制好了以后，她已等不及把菜摆到桌子上，而是立刻拿了几片叶子，放到嘴里，几乎还没等她吞下那叶子，她就没了人形，变成一头毛驴冲到了院子里。这时，巫婆的女仆也来到了厨房，她看到菜已调制好了，便要端过来，但是在路上，想尝一尝的欲望促使她习惯性地偷吃了几口菜叶。魔力立刻显现出来，女仆也同样变成一头毛驴蹿了出去，跑向老巫婆那里，盛着沙拉菜的盘子掉落到地上。此时时刻，信使正坐在那个漂亮姑娘的身边，因为没人送来沙拉，而姑娘又十分想尝一尝，便说道：“不知道菜做得怎么样了呢。”猎人心想：“圆白菜一定已经发挥了魔力。”他说：“我到厨房去问一问。”他来到楼下后，看到两头毛驴在院子里跑来跑去，而圆白菜也洒落一地。猎人说：“太好了，这两位已经遭到报应了。”他拾起地上的菜叶，放回到盘子里，端到了姑娘面前。他说道：“我亲自把美味的蔬菜给你端来了，这样你就不用再多等了。”于是，姑娘吃了蔬菜，像老巫婆和女仆一样，她也立即失去人形，变成一头毛驴跑到了院子里。随后，猎人把脸洗干净，以便那变形后的三只毛驴能认出他来，他来到院子里，说道：“现在你们该为自己的背叛付出代价了。”他用一根绳子把三头驴绑到一起，把它们一直赶到了一座磨坊前。他敲了敲窗户，磨坊主探出脑袋，问他有什么事情。猎人答道：“我有三头不听话的毛驴，不想再养了。只要你能收下它们，给它们食粮和草棚，按我说的管教它们，你要多少钱我就给你多少。”磨坊主说：“为什么不呢？可我要怎么管教它们呢？”","Then the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue.When he awoke next morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another of the good ones, and thought to himself, “This shall help me to get my own again and punish treachery.”Then he took the cabbages with him, climbed over the wall, and went forth to seek for the castle of his sweetheart.After wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky enough to find it again.He dyed his face brown, so that his own mother would not have known him; and begged for shelter: “I am so tired,” said he, “that I can go no further.”The witch asked, “Who are you, countryman, and what is your business?”“I am a King’s messenger, and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which grows beneath the sun.I have even been so fortunate as to find it, and am carrying it about with me; but the heat of the sun is so intense that the delicate cabbage threatens to wither, and I do not know if I can carry it any further.”When the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and said, “Dear countryman, let me just taste this wonderful salad.”“Why not?” answered he, “I have brought two heads with me, and will give you one of them,” and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage.The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so for this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed it.When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the table, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her mouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her human shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an ass.Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad standing there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up; but on the way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste, and she ate a couple of leaves.Instantly the magic power showed itself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman, and the dish of salad fell to the ground.Meantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, “I don’t know what has become of the salad.”The huntsman thought, “The salad must have already taken effect,” and said, “I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it.”As he went down he saw the two asses running about in the courtyard; the salad, however, was lying on the ground.“All right,” said he, “the two have taken their portion,” and he picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried them to the maiden.“I bring you the delicate food myself,” said he, “in order that you may not have to wait longer.”Then she ate of it, and was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and ran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass.After the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones could recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said, “Now you shall receive the wages of your treachery,” and bound them together, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came to a mill.He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head, and asked what he wanted.“I have three unmanageable beasts,” answered he, “which I don’t want to keep any longer.Will you take them in, and give them food and stable room, and manage them as I tell you, and then I will pay you what you ask.”The miller said, “Why not? But how am I to manage them?”"
"猎人便吩咐说，每天打那头老驴三次，喂它一次，因为它原来是个老巫婆；每天打那个小一些的驴一次，喂它三次，它以前只是个女仆而已；至于那头最小的驴，原来是那位少女，不要打它，每天喂它三次，猎人舍不得她被打啊。之后，猎人回到了城堡里，在那里，他找到了所有自己需要的东西。","The huntsman then said that he was to give three beatings and one meal daily to the old donkey, and that was the witch; one beating and three meals to the younger one, which was the servant girl; and to the youngest, which was the maiden, no beatings and three meals, for he could not bring himself to have the maiden beaten.After that he went back into the castle, and found therein everything he needed."
"几天后，磨坊主来了，说他必须通知他，那头每天遭三顿打、只能吃一顿饭的老驴已经死掉了。他又继续说：“另外两头驴虽然每天吃三顿饭，并没有死，可是它们太伤心了，恐怕也挺不了多久了。”猎人忍不住同情起它们，将气愤抛到脑后，让磨坊主把那两头毛驴赶了回来。两头毛驴回来后，猎人给它们吃了一些好菜叶子，它们就又恢复了人形。漂亮姑娘双膝跪在猎人面前，说：“啊，亲爱的，原谅我对你犯下的罪行吧，是我母亲强迫我那么做的。我并不情愿那样对你，因为我深爱着你。你的许愿披风挂在橱柜里，至于鸟心，我会服一剂药吐给你。”可猎人的想法却不同，他说：“留着鸟心吧，给我给你都一样，因为我要娶你为妻。”于是，猎人和姑娘举行了婚礼，从此一生都幸福地生活在一起。","After a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him that the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal daily was dead; “the two others,” he continued, “are certainly not dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they cannot last much longer.”The huntsman was moved to pity, put away his anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him.And when they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they became human again.The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him, and said, “Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you; my mother drove me to it; it was done against my will, for I love you dearly.Your wishing cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the bird’s heart I will take a vomiting potion.”But he thought otherwise, and said, “Keep it; it is all the same, for I will take thee for my true wife.”So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily together until their death."
"忠诚的费迪南德","Ferdinand the Faithful"
"从前有一对夫妇，他们生活富裕的时候一直都没有孩子，可穷困之时却生下了一个小男孩。然而，他们没能给儿子找位教父，于是丈夫说他要去其他地方看看能否给儿子找到一位。他正赶路的时候，遇到了一位穷人，穷人问他要到哪里去。他说他要去看看能否给儿子找一位教父。因为生活拮据，所以没人愿意给儿子做教父。那位穷人说：“噢，你贫困，我也贫困；我愿意做你儿子的教父，不过我这么困难，就不能给孩子什么礼物了。回家告诉产妇，把孩子带到教堂去吧。”","Once on a time lived a man and a woman who so long as they were rich had no children, but when they were poor they had a little boy.They could, however, find no godfather for him, so the man said he would just go to another place to see if he could get one there.As he went, a poor man met him, who asked him where he was going.He said he was going to see if he could get a godfather, that he was poor, so no one would stand as godfather for him.“Oh,” said the poor man, “you are poor, and I am poor; I will be godfather for you, but I am so ill off I can give the child nothing.Go home and tell the nurse that she is to come to the church with the child.”"
"当夫妇俩赶到教堂的时候，那个乞丐已经等在那里了，他给孩子取了一个名字：忠诚的费迪南德。","When they all got to the church together, the beggar was already there, and he gave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful."
"走出教堂后，乞丐说道：“现在回家去吧，我不能给你们什么，你们同样也不需要给我什么。”但他还是给了孩子的母亲一把钥匙，并告诉她，到家以后把钥匙交给孩子的父亲，由父亲一直保管到孩子十四岁。那时要让孩子前往一片荒野，荒野上有一座城堡，用这把钥匙可以进入城堡，那城堡里的一切就都归孩子所有了。现在孩子已经七岁了，个头儿长得很大。一次和其他几个男孩玩耍的时候，大家都吹嘘教父给自己的礼物最多；可他却什么也说不出，为此很烦恼地回到家，问父亲：“教父什么都没有送给我吗？”父亲答道：“噢，送了的，他送给你一把钥匙，如果荒野上有一座城堡的话，你就可以到那里打开城堡。”于是男孩便去了，可并没有看到城堡，也没有听人说起过。","When he was going out of the church, the beggar said, “Now go home, I can give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing.”But he gave a key to the nurse, and told her when she got home she was to give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child was fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where there was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was therein should belong to him.Now when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he once went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that he had got more from his godfather than the other; but the child could say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his father, “Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?”“Oh, yes,” said the father, “thou hadst a key if there is a castle standing on the heath, just go to it and open it.”Then the boy went thither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of."
"又过了七年，那时他已经十四岁了，又一次来到那里，城堡果真矗立在那儿。他打开了大门，里面除了一匹白色的马之外什么都没有。男孩为自己拥有了一匹马而满心欢喜，他骑上马，飞奔回父亲那里去。他说：“我现在有一匹白马了，我要周游世界去啦。”于是他便动身了。正赶路时，他看到路上有一支鹅毛笔。起初他想捡起来，可后来又暗自想：“我还是别管它了；要是需要笔的话，我会在途经的地方轻易找到一支的。”他正骑马离开的时候，身后传来了一个声音：“忠诚的费迪南德，带上这支笔吧。”他四周张望了一下，却没看到一个人影，于是又回去捡起了笔。他骑马又行了一段路后，路经一片湖泊，岸堤上躺着一条鱼，正气喘吁吁地挣扎着，他便说：“等等，可怜的小鱼，我帮你回到水里去。”于是他提起鱼尾巴，把它丢进了水里。小鱼将头昂出水面，说道：“既然你帮我摆脱了污泥，我要送你一把长笛；你需要帮助的时候就吹响笛子，我会去帮你的，要是你把什么东西掉进了水里，也吹一下笛子，我也会去帮助你。”他骑着马继续赶路，遇到了一个人，这人问他要到哪里去。“噢，去附近的一个地方。”这人又问他叫什么名字。“忠诚的费迪南德。”“啊！这么说我们的名字几乎一样啊，我叫不忠诚的费迪南德。”于是他们俩一起动身赶往最近的一家旅馆。","After seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went thither, and there stood the castle.When he had opened it, there was nothing within but a horse, a white one.Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father.“Now I have a white horse, and I will travel,” said he.So he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road.At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, “Thou shouldst leave it lying there; thou wilt easily find a pen where thou art going, if thou hast need of one.”As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, “Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with thee.”He looked around, but saw no one, then he went back again and picked it up.When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, “Wait, my dear fish, I will help thee get into the water,” and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake.Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, “As thou hast helped me out of the mud I will give thee a flute; when thou art in any need, play on it, and then I will help thee, and if ever thou lettest anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to thee.”Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going.“Oh, to the next place.”Then what his name was?“Ferdinand the Faithful.”“So!then we have got almost the same name, I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful.”And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place."
"这真不幸，因为不忠诚的费迪南德知道对方的所有想法以及想要做的所有事情；他是通过各种邪恶的魔法了解到的。旅馆里又来了一位诚实的姑娘，她面目清秀，举止可爱。她因为忠诚的费迪南德潇洒俊秀而爱上了他，她问他要到哪里去。他说：“噢，我就是到处走走。”于是她劝说他应该留下来，因为这个国家的国王正需要一位卫士或者开路骑士，他应该去为国王效力。他回答说，他不好意思到国王那样的人面前毛遂自荐。姑娘便说：“噢，我会马上代你去说的。”于是她径直来到国王面前，告诉他她认识一位可以给他当卫士的绝佳人选。国王为此很高兴，叫人把忠诚的费迪南德请来，要让他来为自己效力。然而，他更希望当一名开路骑士，因为他想和自己的白马在一起，于是国王便让他做了开路骑士。当不忠诚的费迪南德了解到这些情况后，对姑娘说：“什么？你帮了他却不帮我？”姑娘说：“噢，我也会帮你的。”她心想：“这人不可信，我可不能惹他。”于是她又去拜见国王，向国王推荐他当卫士，国王也欣然接受了。","Now it was unfortunate that Ferdinand the Unfaithful knew everything that the other had ever thought and everything he was about to do; he knew it by means of all kinds of wicked arts.There was, however, in the inn an honest girl, who had a bright face and behaved very prettily.She fell in love with Ferdinand the Faithful because he was a handsome man, and she asked him whither he was going.“Oh, I am just travelling round about,” said he.Then she said he ought to stay there, for the King of that country wanted an attendant or an outrider, and he ought to enter his service.He answered he could not very well go to any one like that and offer himself.Then said the maiden, “Oh, but I will soon do that for you.”And so she went straight to the King, and told him that she knew of an excellent servant for him.He was well pleased with that, and had Ferdinand the Faithful brought to him, and wanted to make him his servant.He, however, liked better to be an outrider, for where his horse was, there he also wanted to be, so the King made him an outrider.When Ferdinand the Unfaithful learnt that, he said to the girl, “What!Dost thou help him and not me?”“Oh,” said the girl, “I will help thee too.”She thought, “I must keep friends with that man, for he is not to be trusted.”She went to the King, and offered him as a servant, and the King was willing."
"现在，每当国王早晨见臣子的时候，总是会遗憾地说：“唉，要是我的爱人陪伴着我就好了。”然而，不忠诚的费迪南德却一直对忠诚的费迪南德心怀不满。因此，国王又一次如此抱怨的时候，他便说：“你不是有一位开路骑士吗，派他去把她带来吧，要是他不去办，就砍下他的脑袋。”于是国王便派人去叫来忠诚的费迪南德，对他说，在某个地方有一位他爱着的姑娘，他要把她带来，不去的话就要被斩首。","Now when the King met his lords in the morning, he always lamented and said, “Oh, if I had but my love with me.”Ferdinand the Unfaithful was, however, always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful.So once, when the King was complaining thus, he said, “You have the outrider, send him away to get her, and if he does not do it, his head must be struck off.”Then the King sent for Ferdinand the Faithful, and told him that there was, in this place or in that place, a girl he loved, and that he was to bring her to him, and if he did not do it he should die."
"忠诚的费迪南德来到马棚里的白马跟前，悲伤地诉苦道：“啊，我多么不幸啊！”这时，他身后有人喊道：“忠诚的费迪南德，你为什么悲叹啊？”他四处看了看，却没看到任何人，便继续诉苦：“噢，我亲爱的小白马，我现在不得不离开你了；我就要死了。”这时，又有人喊道：“忠诚的费迪南德，你为什么悲叹？”忽然，他第一次意识到，询问他的正是他的小白马。“你会说话吗，我的小白马；你会说话吗？”他又说道：“我要去某个地方寻找国王的心上人；你能告诉我该怎么办吗？”小白马回答道：“你去见国王，跟他说，如果他能给你你需要的东西，你就去把他的心上人带来。要是他能给你一艘满载肉和一艘满载面包的船只的话，你就能做到了。湖上有一些巨人，如果你没有肉给他们，他们就会把你撕成碎片，还有一些大鸟，如果你不给它们面包，它们就会抠出你的眼睛来。”于是国王命令全国的屠夫杀猪宰羊，面包师烘烤面包，以便装满两艘船只。船只都装满后，小白马对忠诚的费迪南德说：“现在骑上我，和我一起到船上去，等巨人来的时候，就照这样说：‘安静，安静，我亲爱的小巨人，我已经为你们考虑过了。","Ferdinand the Faithful went into the stable to his white horse, and complained and lamented, “Oh, what an unhappy man I am!”Then someone behind him cried, “Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?”He looked round but saw no one, and went on lamenting; “Oh, my dear little white horse, now must I leave thee; now must I die.”Then some one cried once more, “Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?”Then for the first time he was aware that it was his little white horse who was putting that question.“Dost thou speak, my little white horse; canst thou do that?”And again, he said, “I am to go to this place and to that, and am to bring the bride; canst thou tell me how I am to set about it?”Then answered the little white horse, “Go thou to the King, and say if he will give thou what thou must have, thou wilt get her for him.If he will give thee a ship full of meat, and a ship full of bread, it will succeed.Great giants dwell on the lake, and if thou takest no meat with thee for them, they will tear thee to pieces, and there are the large birds which would pick the eyes out of thy head if thou hadst no bread for them.”Then the King made all the butchers in the land kill, and all the bakers bake, that the ships might be filled.When they were full, the little white horse said to Ferdinand the Faithful, “Now mount me, and go with me into the ship, and then when the giants come, say,‘Peace, peace, my dear little giants, I have had thought of ye,"
"我已为你们带来了食物。’","Something I have brought for ye;’"
"大鸟飞来的时候，你就说：","and when the birds come, thou shalt again say,"
"‘安静，安静，我亲爱的小鸟，我已经为你们考虑过了。","“Peace, peace, my dear little birds, I have had thought of ye,"
"我已为你们带来了食物。’","Something I have brought for ye;”"
"那样他们就不会对你怎么样了，你到达城堡的时候，巨人们还会帮助你的。然后你就带上几个巨人一起走进城堡。那里躺着一位正熟睡的公主；然而，你不能吵醒她，但巨人一定要把她连同床抬起来，送到船上去。”事情按小白马所说的逐一进行着，忠诚的费迪南德把带来的食物分给了巨人和大鸟，巨人也心甘情愿地将公主抬到了国王面前。当公主来到国王面前的时候，却说，如果没有了她的那些落在城堡中的文件，她就活不成了。国王受到不忠诚的费迪南德的煽动，又叫来忠诚的费迪南德，告诉他去把城堡中的那些文件拿来，不然就杀了他。他再一次来到马棚前，悲叹道：“唉，我亲爱的小白马啊，现在我又要离开了，我该怎么办呢？”小白马告诉他只需要再次去把船只装满食物。于是，所有事情又如同先前那般进展着，巨人和大鸟也很满意，因食物而变得很温顺。当他们来到城堡时，白马告诉忠诚的费迪南德，他必须要进去，那些文件就放在公主卧室的桌子上。忠诚的费迪南德便进去取出了文件。他们在湖上时，他的笔落到了水里，白马说：“这我可帮不了你了。”可他还记得他的长笛，便吹起来，小鱼闻声，嘴里衔着笔就游来了，把笔交给了他。所以他把文件带回了王宫，宫里正在为国王的婚礼进行庆祝。","then they will do nothing to thee, and when thou comest to the castle, the giants will help thee.Then go up to the castle, and take a couple of giants with thee.There the princess lies sleeping; thou must, however, not awaken her, but the giants must lift her up, and carry her in her bed to the ship.”And now everything took place as the little white horse had said, and Ferdinand the Faithful gave the giants and the birds what he had brought with him for them, and that made the giants willing, and they carried the princess in her bed to the King.And when she came to the King, she said she could not live, she must have her writings, they had been left in her castle.Then by the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, Ferdinand the Faithful was called, and the King told him he must fetch the writings from the castle, or he should die.Then he went once more into the stable, and bemoaned himself and said, “Oh, my dear little white horse, now I am to go away again, how am I to do it?”Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again.So it happened again as it had happened before, and the giants and the birds were satisfied, and made gentle by the meat.When they came to the castle, the white horse told Ferdinand the Faithful that he must go in, and that on the table in the princess’s bed-room lay the writings.And Ferdinand the Faithful went in, and fetched them.When they were on the lake, he let his pen fall into the water; then said the white horse, “Now I cannot help thee at all.”But he remembered his flute, and began to play on it, and the fish came with the pen in its mouth, and gave it to him.So he took the writings to the castle, where the wedding was celebrated."
"可是，王后并不喜欢国王，因为国王没有鼻子。她深深喜欢的人是忠诚的费迪南德。因此，当宫中大臣再一次聚集到一起的时候，王后说，她会魔法，能砍下人头再把它接好，应该让人来试一试。但是没人愿意最先尝试，因此，在不忠诚的费迪南德的怂恿下，忠诚的费迪南德同意最先尝试一下。于是她砍下了他的头，而后又为他接好了，伤口立即就愈合了，看起来就像脖子上绕了一条红线。国王问道：“亲爱的，你从哪里学的这魔法啊？”她说：“是的，我懂魔法啊；我能给你也试一下吗？”他说：“噢，好的。”可是，她砍下他的头后，却不再为他接上；而是假装她怎样都接不好。于是国王便被埋葬了，而她嫁给了忠诚的费迪南德。","The Queen, however, did not love the King because he had no nose, but she would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful.Once, therefore, when all the lords of the court were together, the Queen said she could do feats of magic, that she could cut off any one’s head and put it on again, and that one of them ought just to try it.But none of them would be the first, so Ferdinand the Faithful, again at the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, undertook it and she hewed off his head, and put it on again for him, and it healed together directly, so that it looked as if he had a red thread round his throat.Then the King said to her, “My child, and where hast thou learnt that?”“Yes,” she said, “I understand the art; shall I just try it on thee also?”“Oh, yes,” said he.But she cut off his head, and did not put it on again; but pretended that she could not get it on, and that it would not keep fixed.Then the King was buried, but she married Ferdinand the Faithful."
"他仍旧总是骑着他的那匹白马。一次他正骑在马上时，白马让他到他所熟悉的那片荒野去，绕着那里飞奔三圈。他做完这一切后，白马便用后腿站立起来，变成了一个王子。","He, however, always rode on his white horse, and once when he was seated on it, it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he knew, and gallop three times round it.And when he had done that, the white horse stood up on its hind legs, and was changed into a King’s son."

"从前，有一个精通各种手艺的人，他曾参加过战争，而且表现得十分勇猛。可是战争结束后，他便被打发回家，只拿到三法新的路费。他说：“走着瞧，我不会就此满足。只要我能遇到合适的人手，连国王都得把全国的钱财送给我。”他满腹怒气地走进了森林，看到有一个人站在那里，把六棵大树连根拔，就像拔玉米的叶片一样轻松。他对那人说：“你愿意为我效力，跟着我走吗？”那人答道：“我愿意。不过，我要先把这一小捆柴背回家给我母亲。”他用一棵树捆起另外五棵树，扛到肩上就走了。然后他返回来，和退伍老兵一同上路。老兵说：“咱俩肯定能闯遍世界，无往而不胜。”他们走了一会儿，碰到一个猎人，他跪在地上，肩上扛着一把枪，正要射击。老兵问他：“猎手，你要射什么呀？”猎人答道：“离这两英里远的一棵橡树上有一只苍蝇，我要射它的左眼。”老兵说：“噢，跟我走吧。如果我们三个结伴而行，一定能闯遍世界，无往而不胜！”猎人心甘情愿地跟他一块走了。他们遇到七架风车，风车转得飞快，可四面八方却没有一丝风，树叶也纹丝不动。于是老兵说：“一丝风也没有，不知道是什么推动风车转的。”他与仆人继续赶路，大约走了两英里，他们看到树上坐着一个人，他正堵住一个鼻孔，用另一个往外吹气。“天啊！你坐在那里做什么呢？”","There was once a man who understood all kinds of arts; he served in war, and behaved well and bravely, but when the war was over he received his dismissal, and three farthings for his expenses on the way.“Stop,” said he, “I shall not be content with this.If I can only meet with the right people, the King will yet have to give me all the treasure of the country.”Then full of anger he went into the forest, and saw a man standing therein who had plucked up six trees as if they were blades of corn.He said to him, “Wilt thou be my servant and go with me?”“Yes,” he answered, “but, first, I will take this little bundle of sticks home to my mother,” and he took one of the trees, and wrapped it round the five others, lifted the bundle on his back, and carried it away.Then he returned and went with his master, who said, “We two ought to be able to get through the world very well,” and when they had walked on for a short while they found a huntsman who was kneeling, had shouldered his gun, and was about to fire.The master said to him, “Huntsman, what art thou going to shoot?”He answered, “Two miles from here a fly is sitting on the branch of an oak-tree, and I want to shoot its left eye out.”“Oh, come with me,” said the man, “if we three are together, we certainly ought to be able to get on in the world!”The huntsman was ready, and went with him, and they came to seven windmills whose sails were turning round with great speed, and yet no wind was blowing either on the right or the left, and no leaf was stirring.Then said the man, “I know not what is driving the windmills, not a breath of air is stirring,” and he went onwards with his servants, and when they had walked two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree who was shutting one nostril, and blowing out of the other.“Good gracious! What are you doing up there?”"
"他答道：“离这儿两英里远的地方有七架风车。你看，我正吹气让它们转起来呢。”老兵说：“噢，跟我走吧。”“要是我们四个结伴而行，我们一定所向披靡！”于是，用鼻孔吹气的人爬下树，与他一起上路了。走了一会儿，他们又看到一个人，只用一条腿站立，另一条腿被拆了下来，放在旁边。于是，老兵说：“你这样安排，休息起来可真舒服啊。”他答道：“我是个跑步高手，为了不让自己跑得太快，我拆下了一条腿，因为我要是用两条腿跑步的话，那比任何鸟儿飞得都快。”“噢，跟我走吧。要是我们五个人结伴而行的话，我们就能所向披靡。”于是跑步高手加入了他们的队伍。不久，他们又遇到一个戴帽子的人，整顶帽子都扣在一只耳朵上。老兵对他说：“斯文点，斯文点，别把帽子扣在一只耳朵上，你看起来就像个傻子！”他说：“我不能那样戴。要是我把帽子戴正的话，就会有一场严重的霜冻，所有的鸟儿都会被冻死，掉到地上。”老兵说：“噢，跟我走吧。”“如果我们六个人结伴而行的话，我们就能所向披靡。”现在，他们六人来到一座城镇。国王宣布说，如果谁和公主赛跑能胜过公主的话，他就把公主嫁给他，否则他就要掉脑袋。于是，老兵自告奋勇地说：“我能，但是，我要让我的同伴替我赛跑。”国王答道：“那他的生命也要拿来做赌注，这样的话，你俩的脑袋都是赌注了。”双方商量好后，老兵给跑步高手装上了另一条腿，对他说：“跑快点，你要帮我们取胜。”双方约定，谁第一个从远处的井里打回水来，谁就是胜利者。跑步高手和公主手中各提着一把壶，他们同时起跑。可公主才刚刚跑了一小段路，跑步高手刹那间就跑出了旁观者的视线，好像是一阵风刮过一样。跑步高手很快就跑到了井边。给壶装满水后，他便往回跑。可是，他在半路上就累得不得了。于是他放下水壶，躺在地上睡着了。他用地上的一个马的头盖骨作枕头，这样他就不会枕得太舒服，很快就能醒过来。这时，那个凡人中算得上跑步高手的公主也到达了井边，她给壶装满水后便匆匆地往回跑。当她看到跑步高手躺在那里睡着了，她很高兴，说：“对手落在我的手上了。”她把跑步高手壶里的水倒掉，然后继续往回跑。要不是目光敏锐的猎人，站在城堡顶部，看到了这一切，否则就全完了。猎人说道：“不能让公主领先。”他给枪装好子弹，精准地射中了跑步高手枕着的马头骨，马头骨被射飞了，而跑步高手却丝毫没有受到伤害。跑步高手被惊醒了，他跳了起来，发现水壶空了，而公主已远远领先于他。然而，他并没有灰心丧气，他拿着壶跑回井边，又给水壶装满水，而且比公主早十分钟到达终点。他说：“看，我现在才是甩开了步子跑步，以前根本不叫跑。”可是，让公主要嫁给这样一个平凡的退伍老兵，国王很苦恼，公主更是如此。于是他俩商量着怎样才能摆脱老兵和他的同伴。国王对公主说：“我想出了一个办法。不要怕，他们回不来了。”国王对他们说：“你们该好好吃喝一顿，乐呵一下了。”他把他们带到一间有铁制地板的屋子里，房门也是铁做的，连窗户上也安着铁栏杆。屋内的桌子上摆满了可口的食物。国王对他们说：“大家进去尽情享用吧。”他们都进去后，国王命人从外面锁上所有的房门。然后国王叫来厨师，命令他在屋子底下生火，直到把地板烧红。厨师照做了。六个好汉围坐在桌旁吃饭，感到有些热。一开始，他们以为是吃饭的缘故。可是，屋里越来越热，他们就都想到屋外去，却发现，门窗都上了锁。他们这才明白，王国没怀好意，想要置他们于死地。歪戴帽子的人说：“他不会得逞的。”“我要叫来严寒，大火在它面前也会羞愧难当，悄悄溜走的。”于是，他把帽子戴正，严寒立即就来了。所有的热气即刻消失不见，盘中的食物也都开始结冰。过了一两个小时，国王以为他们早被热死了，便命人打开房门，他要亲眼看看他们。可是，当房门打开后，那六个好汉都活泼而健康地站在那里。他们都说要到屋外暖和一下，屋里太冷了，碗里的食物很快就被冻住了。国王满腹怒气地去找厨师，责骂他，并质问他为什么没按吩咐去做。厨师答道：“铁板已经够热了，你可以亲自去看看。”国王看到屋子下面确实燃着熊熊大火，他意识到这个办法制服不了那六个人。国王又开始想办法，怎样才能摆脱这几个不讨他喜欢的家伙。他叫来退伍老兵，对他说：“要是你肯收下金子，不娶我的女儿，你想拿多少金子都可以。”老兵答道：“噢，好的，陛下，要是我的同伴能搬多少你就给多少的话，我就不娶公主了。”听到这些话，国王很满意。老兵继续说：“十四天后，我来取金子。”于是，老兵召集来全国的裁缝，让他们用十四天的时间缝制一个大口袋。口袋缝好后，那个能轻易拔起大树的壮汉把口袋搭在肩上，便去找国王了。国王问：“那个壮汉是谁啊？身上的袋子跟房子一样大。”国王很惊讶，说：“他能搬走多少金子啊！”国王命人搬来一吨金子。十六个最有劲的人才把这些金子搬了来，可壮汉只用一只手就把这些金子抓进口袋，说：“为什么不多拿些来呢？这些连袋子底儿都盖不住呢！”于是，国王命人一点一点地把他所有的金子都搬了过来，壮汉把这些金子都放进口袋，可袋子连一半都没装满。他喊道：“再搬些过来，这么一点哪儿够装满袋子啊。”于是，全国范围内又聚集来了七千辆卡车的金子，壮汉将车带牛全都装进了口袋里。他说：“我也不挑拣了，你们拿什么我就装什么，直到袋子装满为止。”所有的东西都被装进去后，袋子里还有很大的空间，壮汉便说：“就这样吧，虽然袋子还没装满，我还是把袋子口扎起来吧。”然后他把袋子扛到背上，和同伴们一起走了。国王看到一个壮汉就拿走了全国的财产，他很愤怒，命令骑兵去追赶那六个人，并下令要抢回壮汉的袋子。两团骑兵很快就追上了这六个人，冲他们喊道：“你们都被捕了，放下装金子的口袋，不然就把你们剁成肉泥！”用鼻孔吹气的人说：“你们说什么？我们被捕了？这怎么可能呢？不过我倒是要让你们飞到天上去。”他堵住一个鼻孔，用另一个鼻孔对着这两团骑兵吹气。他们立即就被吹散了，飞上蓝天，穿越高山，落得这里一个，那里一个。一个上士大喊救命，他身上有九处伤。上士是个英勇的人，不该受此对待。用鼻孔吹气的人停了下来，上士安全地落到地面上。吹气的人对他说：“回去见你们的国王吧，告诉他，最好再派些骑兵来，我会把他们都吹上天的。”国王听到这些话后，说：“放走那些无赖吧。他们都不简单啊。”于是，六条好汉带着金子回家了。他们平分了金子，一辈子都过得很快乐。","He answered, “Two miles from here are seven windmills; look, I am blowing them till they turn round.”“Oh, come with me,” said the man.“If we four are together, we shall carry the whole world before us!”Then the blower came down and went with him, and after a while they saw a man who was standing on one leg and had taken off the other, and laid it beside him.Then the master said, “You have arranged things very comfortably to have a rest.”“I am a runner,” he replied, “and to stop myself running far too fast, I have taken off one of my legs, for if I run with both, I go quicker than any bird can fly.”“Oh, go with me.If we five are together, we shall carry the whole world before us.”So he went with them, and it was not long before they met a man who wore a cap, but had put it quite on one ear.Then the master said to him, “Gracefully, gracefully, don’t stick your cap on one ear, you look just like a tom-fool!”“I must not wear it otherwise,” said he, “for if I set my hat straight, a terrible frost comes on, and all the birds in the air are frozen, and drop dead on the ground.”“Oh, come with me,” said the master.“If we six are together, we can carry the whole world before us.”Now the six came to a town where the King had proclaimed that whosoever ran a race with his daughter and won the victory, should be her husband, but whosoever lost it, must lose his head.Then the man presented himself and said, “I will, however, let my servant run for me.”The King replied, “Then his life also must be staked, so that his head and thine are both set on the victory.”When that was settled and made secure, the man buckled the other leg on the runner, and said to him, “Now be nimble, and help us to win.”It was fixed that the one who was first to bring some water from a far distant well was to be the victor.The runner received a pitcher, and the King’s daughter one too, and they began to run at the same time, but in an instant, when the King’s daughter had got a very little way, the people who were looking on could see no more of the runner, and it was just as if the wind had whistled by.In a short time he reached the well, filled his pitcher with water, and turned back.Half-way home, however, he was overcome with fatigue, and set his pitcher down, lay down himself, and fell asleep.He had, however, made a pillow of a horse’s skull which was lying on the ground, in order that he might lie uncomfortably, and soon wake up again.In the meantime the King’s daughter, who could also run very well quite as well as any ordinary mortal can had reached the well, and was hurrying back with her pitcher full of water, and when she saw the runner lying there asleep, she was glad and said, “My enemy is delivered over into my hands,” emptied his pitcher, and ran on.And now all would have been lost if by good luck the huntsman had not been standing at the top of the castle, and had not seen everything with his sharp eyes.Then said he, “The King’s daughter shall still not prevail against us;” and he loaded his gun, and shot so cleverly, that he shot the horse’s skull away from under the runner’s head without hurting him.Then the runner awoke, leapt up, and saw that his pitcher was empty, and that the King’s daughter was already far in advance.He did not lose heart, however, but ran back to the well with his pitcher, again drew some water, and was at home again, ten minutes before the King’s daughter.“Behold!” said he, “I have not bestirred myself till now, it did not deserve to be called running before.”But it pained the King, and still more his daughter, that she should be carried off by a common disbanded soldier like that; so they took counsel with each other how to get rid of him and his companions.Then said the King to her, “I have thought of a way; don’t be afraid, they shall not come back again.”And he said to them, “You shall now make merry together, and eat and drink,” and he conducted them to a room which had a floor of iron, and the doors also were of iron, and the windows were guarded with iron bars.There was a table in the room covered with delicious food, and the King said to them, “Go in, and enjoy yourselves.”And when they were inside, he ordered the doors to be shut and bolted.Then he sent for the cook, and commanded him to make a fire under the room until the iron became red-hot.This the cook did, and the six who were sitting at table began to feel quite warm, and they thought the heat was caused by the food; but as it became still greater, and they wanted to get out, and found that the doors and windows were bolted, they became aware that the King must have an evil intention, and wanted to suffocate them.“He shall not succeed, however,” said the one with the cap.“I will cause a frost to come, before which the fire shall be ashamed, and creep away.”Then he put his cap on straight, and immediately there came such a frost that all heat disappeared, and the food on the dishes began to freeze.When an hour or two had passed by, and the King believed that they had perished in the heat, he had the doors opened to behold them himself.But when the doors were opened, all six were standing there, alive and well, and said that they should very much like to get out to warm themselves, for the very food was fast frozen to the dishes with the cold.Then, full of anger, the King went down to the cook, scolded him, and asked why he had not done what he had been ordered to do.But the cook replied, “There is heat enough there, just look yourself.”Then the King saw that a fierce fire was burning under the iron room, and perceived that there was no getting the better of the six in this way.Again the King considered how to get rid of his unpleasant guests, and caused their chief to be brought and said, “If thou wilt take gold and renounce my daughter, thou shalt have as much as thou wilt.”“Oh, yes, Lord King,” he answered, “give me as much as my servant can carry, and I will not ask for your daughter.”On this the King was satisfied, and the other continued, “In fourteen days, I will come and fetch it.”Thereupon he summoned together all the tailors in the whole kingdom, and they were to sit for fourteen days and sew a sack.And when it was ready, the strong one who could tear up trees had to take it on his back, and go with it to the King.Then said the King, “Who can that strong fellow be who is carrying a bundle of linen on his back that is as big as a house?” and he was alarmed and said, “What a lot of gold he can carry away!”Then he commanded a ton of gold to be brought; it took sixteen of his strongest men to carry it, but the strong one snatched it up in one hand, put it in his sack, and said, “Why don’t you bring more at the same time?That hardly covers the bottom!”Then, little by little, the King caused all his treasure to be brought thither, and the strong one pushed it into the sack, and still the sack was not half full with it.“Bring more,” cried he, “these few crumbs don’t fill it.”Then seven thousand carts with gold had to be gathered together in the whole kingdom, and the strong one thrust them and the oxen harnessed to them into his sack.“I will examine it no longer,” said he, “but will just take what comes, so long as the sack is but full.”When all that was inside, there was still room for a great deal more; Then he said, “I will just make an end of the thing; people do sometimes tie up a sack even when it is not full.”So he took it on his back, and went away with his comrades.When the King now saw how one single man was carrying away the entire wealth of the country, he became enraged, and bade his horsemen mount and pursue the six, and ordered them to take the sack away from the strong one.Two regiments speedily overtook the six, and called out, “You are prisoners, put down the sack with the gold, or you will all be cut to pieces!”“What say you?” cried the blower, “that we are prisoners!Rather than that should happen, all of you shall dance about in the air.”And he closed one nostril, and with the other blew on the two regiments.Then they were driven away from each other, and carried into the blue sky over all the mountains one here, the other there.One sergeant cried for mercy; he had nine wounds, and was a brave fellow who did not deserve ill treatment.The blower stopped a little so that he came down without injury, and then the blower said to him, “Now go home to thy King, and tell him he had better send some more horsemen, and I will blow them all into the air.”When the King was informed of this he said, “Let the rascals go.They have the best of it.”Then the six conveyed the riches home, divided it amongst them, and lived in content until their death."
"白雪公主","Little Snow-White"
"很久以前，正值隆冬季节，雪花像羽毛般从空中飘落。有个王后正坐在黑檀木窗前缝衣裳。她正缝补着衣服，一面抬头看看窗外的雪花，手指便被针扎破了。三滴鲜血落到了雪地上。鲜血在白雪上显得分外娇美。于是，王后就在心里想着：“如果我有个孩子皮肤白皙似雪，脸色红润如血，头发能像窗框上的木头那样乌黑，该多好。”","Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black ebony.And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow.And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, “Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame.”"
"不久之后，她有了一个女儿，她的皮肤白皙如雪，脸色红润如血，头发如黑檀木般乌黑。因此被称作“小白雪公主”。生下女儿后，王后就离开了人世。","Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony; and she was therefore called Little Snow-white.And when the child was born, the Queen died."
"一年以后，国王又娶了一个新的王后。她非常漂亮，但自负高傲，她无法忍受有其他人比她更漂亮。她有一面魔镜，当她站在镜子面前，看着镜中的自己时，便说道：","After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife.She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty.She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it, and said-"
"“墙上的魔镜，魔镜，谁是这个世界上最漂亮的女人？”","“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?”"
"魔镜总会回答：","the looking-glass answered-"
"“您，噢，王后，是世界上最漂亮的女人！”","“Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all!”"
"于是王后心满意足，因为她知道，魔镜从不撒谎。","Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth."
"但是，随着白雪公主一天天地长大，她变得越来越美。当白雪公主七岁时，她已经美若天仙，比王后更漂亮了。有一天，王后再次问魔镜：","But Snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the Queen herself.And once when the Queen asked her looking-glass -"
"“墙上的魔镜，魔镜，告诉我，谁是这个世界上最漂亮的女人？”","“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?”"
"魔镜回答：","it answered-"
"“王后，您的美貌超过这里的所有人。但是，我认为，更美丽的还是白雪公主。”","“Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen.”But more beautiful still is Snow-white, as I ween.”"
"王后听罢，大为吃惊。嫉妒之情溢于言表。从那时起，王后一见到白雪公主便怒火中烧，她太嫉恨这个女孩了。","Then the Queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy.From that hour, whenever she looked at Snow-white, her heart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much."
"随着嫉妒和骄傲在她心中如杂草般蔓延开来，她几乎终日不得安宁。她叫来了一个猎人，说：“把那个孩子带进森林里，我再也不想看见她。把她杀掉，把她的心带回来作为证明。”这个猎人遵守了王后的指令，将白雪公主带走。但是，正当他拔出刀子，准备刺向白雪公主纯洁的心脏时，白雪公主开始哭泣，说道：“您就饶了我的命吧，亲爱的猎人！我会跑进荒野的森林，永远不会回家。”","And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had no peace day or night.She called a huntsman, and said, “Take the child away into the forest; I will no longer have her in my sight.Kill her, and bring me back her heart as a token.”The huntsman obeyed, and took her away; but when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce Snow-white’s innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, “Ah dear huntsman, leave me my life!I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.”"
"由于白雪公主实在是太美了，猎人对她产生了同情，说道：“可怜的孩子，那你就快跑吧。”猎人心中暗暗寻思：“反正林里的猛兽也迟早会吃掉你。”同时，不需要杀她，仿佛使他心头的一块大石滚落下来，如释重负。这时，正好有一只野猪跑过，他刺死了它，切下它的心脏，带到王后面前作为那个孩子已经死去的证据。大厨必须将这颗心脏用盐腌上，然后邪恶的王后将其吃掉，她还以为自己吃掉了白雪公主的心脏呢。","And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, “Run away, then, you poor child.”“The wild beasts will soon have devoured you,” thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her.And as a young boar just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its heart and took it to the Queen as proof that the child was dead.The cook had to salt this, and the wicked Queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the heart of Snow-white."
"而现在，苦命的白雪公主只能孤身一人待在偌大的森林里了。她心里惊恐万分，看遍了每一棵树上的每一片叶子，茫然不知所措。随后，她开始奔跑，跑过了锋利的石子，穿过了荆棘，野兽从她的身边跑过，但并没有伤害她。","But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not know what to do.Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm."
"只要腿脚还跑得动，她便一直跑下去，直到夜幕降临，她看到了一间小农舍，便进去歇歇脚。农舍中的所有东西都小巧玲珑，却整洁干净得无以言表。农舍中有一张铺着白桌布的台子，七只小碟子，每只碟子上都有一支小汤匙。另外，还有七副小刀叉，和七只小酒杯。紧靠着墙壁，七张小床一字排开，每张小床都有雪白的床单盖着。","She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening; then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself.Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told.There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon; moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs.Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes."
"白雪公主实在太饿太渴了，她从每只小碟子里吃了一些蔬菜和面包，又从每只杯子里喝了一点酒，因为她不想吃完一套餐具中的食物和酒。吃完以后，白雪公主感到精疲力尽，便躺在一张小床上，可是没有一张床适合她，不是这张床太长，就是那张床太短。最后，她发现第七张床正合适，于是躺在了这张床上，做完祷告，就睡去了。","Little Snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of them suited her; one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep."
"当天色已经相当黑的时候，农舍的主人们回来了。他们是七个在大山里挖掘采矿的小矮人。他们点起了七根蜡烛，现在农舍里亮了起来，他们发现房间有人来过，因为所有物品的摆放位置和他们离开前不同了。","When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back; they were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore.They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within the cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything was not in the same order in which they had left it."
"第一个小矮人问道：“谁坐过了我的椅子？”","The first said, “Who has been sitting on my chair?”"
"第二个小矮人问道：“谁吃了我盘里的食物？”","The second, “Who has been eating off my plate?”"
"第三个小矮人问道：“谁吃了我的一点面包？”","The third, “Who has been taking some of my bread?”"
"第四个小矮人问道：“谁吃了我的蔬菜？”","The fourth, “Who has been eating my vegetables?”"
"第五个小矮人问道：“谁用过我的叉子？”","The fifth, “Who has been using my fork?”"
"第六个小矮人问道：“谁用我的刀子切东西了？”","The sixth, “Who has been cutting with my knife?”"
"第七个小矮人问道：“谁从我的杯子里喝过酒？”","The seventh, “Who has been drinking out of my mug?”"
"第一个小矮人往四周看了看，然后发现自己的床上有一块凹陷下去，便说道：“谁在我的床上躺过？”其他的小矮人们都围拢了上来，每个人都喊道：“我的床也有人躺过了。”然而，当第七个小矮人看到自己的床时，他看到了躺在床上、已经进入梦乡的白雪公主。于是，他便招呼其他的小矮人过来，他们惊讶地叫出声来，把七支小蜡烛聚拢在一起，并让光亮照在白雪公主身上。“哦，我的天呐！哦，我的老天！”他们喊道，“这个孩子多可爱啊！”他们非常高兴，因为他们没有把白雪公主吵醒，于是让她继续在床上睡下去。这第七个小矮人和他的伙伴们睡在一起，一个小时换一张床，就这样，一个晚上过去了。","Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his bed, and he said, “Who has been getting into my bed?”The others came up and each called out, “Somebody has been lying in my bed too.”But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snow-white, who was lying asleep therein.And he called the others, who came running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow-white.“Oh, heavens!oh, heavens!” cried they, “what a lovely child!” and they were so glad that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed.And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through the night."
"第二天早上，当白雪公主醒来，发现七个小矮人时，她十分害怕。但是这七个小矮人对她非常友好，问她叫什么名字。“我的名字叫白雪公主。”她回答。小矮人们说：“你是怎么来到我们房子的呢？”于是，白雪公主便向他们诉说了自己的经历，她告诉他们自己的继母是如何想派人杀了她，猎人是如何放了她的，她如何在林里跑了一整天，最后找到他们房子的经过。小矮人们说道：“如果你能照看我们的房子、烧饭、铺床、洗衣服、缝缝补补，并且把房子打扫得干净整洁，你就可以与我们同住，你就什么都不缺了。”“好的，我会全心全意的。”白雪公主说道。于是，她便住了下来，和小矮人们一起生活。白雪公主为小矮人把农舍收拾整齐。小矮人们每天早晨外出，到山里去寻找铜和金，晚上回到家时，白雪公主必须做好他们的晚餐。由于白雪公主白天都独自一人在家，所以小矮人们便好心地警告她说：“小心你的继母，不久她便会知道你在这里。一定不要让任何人进来。”","When it was morning little Snow-white awoke, and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs.But they were friendly and asked her what her name was.“My name is Snow-white,” she answered.“How have you come to our house?” said the dwarfs.Then she told them that her step-mother had wished to have her killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run for the whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.The dwarfs said, “If you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and clean, you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing.”“Yes,” said Snow-white, “with all my heart,” and she stayed with them.She kept the house in order for them; in the mornings they went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready.The girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her and said, “Beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you are here; be sure to let no one come in.”"
"然而，那个王后相信自己已经吞下了白雪公主的心脏，想当然地认为自己又成为了世界上最美丽的女人。于是她来到魔镜前，说道：","But the Queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-white’s heart, could not but think that she was again the first and most beautiful of all; and she went to her looking-glass and said,"
"“墙上的魔镜，魔镜，谁是这个世界上最漂亮的女人？” 镜子回答道：","“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?” and the glass answered,"
"“噢，女王，依我所见，您是世界上最美丽的女人。可是，白雪公主还好好地活着，住在群山之后七个小矮人的房子里。","“Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well,"
"她的美丽无人能比。”","And none is so fair as she.”"
"听罢，王后非常震惊，因为她知道魔镜从不说谎。于是她知道那个猎人已经背叛了她，而小白雪公主依然活着。","Then she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass never spoke falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, and that little Snow-white was still alive."
"于是她再三寻思该如何除掉白雪公主。因为只要自己不是世界上最美丽的女人，她就会嫉妒得不得安宁。她终于想到该做什么了。她化了装，假扮成一个卖东西的老妪，没有人能认得出她。她乔装成这副模样翻越了七座大山，来到了七个小矮人的家门前。她敲了敲门，喊道：“卖好货了，很便宜，很便宜。”小白雪公主向窗外看去，喊道：“早上好，我善良的女士，你卖什么呢？”王后回答道：“都是好东西、漂亮的东西；各种颜色的丝巾。”说话间，她便拿出一条颜色鲜亮的丝巾。白雪公主寻思：“或许我可以让这个可敬的老婆婆进来。”于是，她便拉开了门闩，并且买下了这条漂亮的丝巾。老妪又说道：“孩子，瞧你吓成什么样了。来，我马上帮你系上丝巾。”白雪公主没有起任何疑心，只是站在这个老妪面前，让她帮自己系上了丝巾。但是老妪系得太快、太紧，于是白雪公主没有了呼吸，倒在地上，好像死去了一样。王后喃喃自语道：“现在，我是世界上最漂亮的女人了。”然后便逃跑了。","And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her have no rest.And when she had at last thought of something to do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old pedler-woman, and no one could have known her.In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, “Pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap.”Little Snow-white looked out of the window and called out, “Good-day my good woman, what have you to sell?”“Good things, pretty things,” she answered; “stay-laces of all colours,” and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk.“I may let the worthy old woman in,” thought Snow-white, and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.“Child,” said the old woman, “what a fright you look; come, I will lace you properly for once.”Snow-white had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself be laced with the new laces.But the old woman laced so quickly and so tightly that Snow-white lost her breath and fell down as if dead.“Now I am the most beautiful,” said the Queen to herself, and ran away."
"没过多久，就到了晚上，七个小矮人回到家，然而当看到他们亲爱的小白雪公主躺在地上，一动不动，看上去就像死了一样时，感到极为震惊。他们把她扶了起来，发现是因为丝巾系得太紧了，于是他们便剪断了丝巾。这才使白雪公主喘过气来，慢慢地恢复清醒了。当小矮人们听说发生的事情后，说道：“这个卖东西的老妪不是别人，正是那个邪恶的王后。你要当心，我们不在家时不要让任何人进来。”","Not long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home, but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little Snow-white lying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to be dead.They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces; then she began to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again.When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, “The old pedler-woman was no one else than the wicked Queen; take care and let no one come in when we are not with you.”"
"但是，当这个邪恶的女人回到家，来到魔镜前，问道：","But the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the glass and asked,"
"“墙上的魔镜，魔镜，谁是这个世界上最漂亮的女人？”","“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?”"
"而魔镜也一如既往地回答道：","and it answered as before-"
"“噢，女王，依我看来，您是世界上最美丽的女人。可是，白雪公主还好好地活着，住在群山之后七个小矮人的房子里。","“Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well,"
"她的美丽无人能比。”","And none is so fair as she.”"
"王后听完这番话，出于恐惧，浑身的血液都涌向了心头，因为她清楚地看到小白雪公主依然活着。她说道：“现在，我要想办法把你彻底除掉。”通过自己掌握的巫术，她做了一把有毒的梳子。随后，她把自己乔装打扮成另一个老妪的模样。就这样，她翻越七座大山，来到了七个小矮人的住所，敲敲门，喊道：“卖好货，便宜卖了，便宜卖了！”小白雪公主向外望去，说道：“走开，我不能让任何人进来。”“我认为你可以先看看再说。”老妪说，取出那把有毒的梳子，高高地举着。白雪公主特别喜欢这把梳子，于是就又上当受骗了，她打开了门。买卖成交后，老妪说道：“我来帮你好好地梳一下头发吧。”可怜的小白雪公主没有任何疑心，让老妪如其所愿地为她梳头发。但是，梳子刚碰到她的头发，毒性便发作了，于是白雪公主昏倒在地。邪恶的女人说道：“你真是个美人胚子，这一回你该没命了吧。”说罢，便离开了。","When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she saw plainly that little Snow-white was again alive.“But now,” she said, “I will think of something that shall put an end to you,” and by the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb.Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman.So she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door, and cried, “Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!”Little Snow-white looked out and said, “Go away; I cannot let any one come in.”“I suppose you can look,” said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up.It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door.When they had made a bargain the old woman said, “Now I will comb you properly for once.”Poor little Snow-white had no suspicion, and let the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl fell down senseless.“You paragon of beauty,” said the wicked woman, “you are done for now,” and she went away."
"幸运的是，天很快就黑了，七个小矮人也回到了家。当他们看到白雪公主躺在地上，就像死了一样，立刻怀疑是她的继母干的，他们看了看，便找到了那把有毒的梳子。他们刚取下梳子，白雪公主便醒了过来。并且告诉他们发生了什么。于是七个小矮人便又告诉她不要放松警惕，不要为任何人开门。","But fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs came home.When they saw Snow-white lying as if dead upon the ground they at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked and found the poisoned comb.Scarcely had they taken it out when Snow-white came to herself, and told them what had happened.Then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one."
"回到宫里，王后又来到了魔镜前，问道：","The Queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said-"
"“墙上的魔镜，魔镜，谁是这个世界上最漂亮的女人？”","“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?”"
"而魔镜像以前一样回答道：","then it answered as before-"
"“噢，女王，依我所见，您是世界上最美丽的女人。可是，白雪公主还好好地活着，住在群山之后七个小矮人的房子里。","“Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well,"
"她的美丽无人能比。”","And none is so fair as she.”"
"听完魔镜说完这句话，她浑身颤抖起来，气急败坏，又怒又惊。她喊道：“就算搭上我的性命，也要除掉白雪公主！”","When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage.“Snow-white shall die,” she cried, “even if it costs me my life!”"
"她随即走进了一间非常隐秘、无人知晓的房间，从未有人来过，在那儿，她做了一个带有剧毒的苹果。在外表看来，这个苹果非常漂亮，白里透红，引得每个看到它的人都想尝一口。但是，任何人只要吃上一小口，就必死无疑。","Thereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no one ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple.Outside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that everyone who saw it longed for it; but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die."
"苹果准备好了之后，她化了装，假扮成一名村妇，翻越七座高山，来到了七个小矮人的住所。她敲了敲门。白雪公主从窗口里探出头来，并且说道：“我不能让任何人进来，七个小矮人不让我开门。”妇人说道：“对我来说都一样，我的苹果很快就能卖完。来，这个我就送给你吧。”","When the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself up as a country-woman, and so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs.She knocked at the door.Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, “I cannot let any one in; the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.”“It is all the same to me,” answered the woman, “I shall soon get rid of my apples.There, I will give you one.”"
"白雪公主回答道：“不，我不敢拿别人的任何东西。”“你是怕这个苹果有毒吗？”老妇人问道，“看，我把苹果切成两半，你吃红的那半，我吃白的那半。”王后十分狡猾地把苹果做成只有红色的那一半有毒。白雪公主想要这个漂亮的苹果，当她看到这个女人吃了一些之后，便再不拒绝，伸出手去，拿来了那半个有毒的苹果。但是，她刚咬了一小口，便倒在地上死去了。于是王后面相狰狞地看着白雪公主，放声大笑，说道：“倒真是个皮肤像雪一样白皙、脸如血色般红润、头发和黑檀木一样乌黑的美人！小矮人们再也不能叫醒你了。”","“No,” said Snow-white, “I dare not take anything.”“Are you afraid of poison?” said the old woman; “look, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.”The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned.Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half.But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead.Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said, “White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood!this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again.”"
"回到宫里，她便问魔镜：","And when she asked of the Looking-glass at home-"
"“墙上的魔镜，魔镜，谁是这个世界上最漂亮的女人？”","“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?”"
"终于，魔镜回答道：","it answered at last-"
"“噢，王后，您是这片土地上最美的女人。”","“Oh, Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all.”"
"于是，她那颗嫉妒的心终于彻底平息下来。","Then her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can have rest."
"晚上，当小矮人们回到家时，发现白雪公主躺在地上，没有了呼吸，已经死去了。他们把白雪公主抬起来，仔细寻找看能不能找到有毒的东西。他们解开她的丝巾，为她梳了头发，还用水和酒为她擦洗。但这一切都无济于事。可怜的孩子已经死了，再也不能复活了。他们把她放在棺材里，七个人围坐在旁边，痛哭流涕，整整哭了三天三夜。","The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying upon the ground; she breathed no longer and was dead.They lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use; the poor child was dead, and remained dead.They laid her upon a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days long."
"然后，他们打算埋葬白雪公主，可是，白雪公主看起来仿佛还活着，她的脸颊依然红润美丽。他们说道：“我们不能把她埋在黑暗的地下。”于是他们让人打造了一副透明的水晶棺材，这样他们可以从各个角度看到她。他们将白雪公主放了进去，在棺材上用金字写上她的名字，还写明这是一位国王的女儿。他们将棺材抬到了高山上，并且始终留一个人照看着她的灵柩。鸟儿也来哭祭白雪公主，首先来的是一只猫头鹰，然后是一只乌鸦，最后是一只鸽子。","Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were living, and still had her pretty red cheeks.They said, “We could not bury her in the dark ground,” and they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king’s daughter.Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always stayed by it and watched it.And birds came too, and wept for Snow-white; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove."
"现在，白雪公主在棺材里躺了很长很长一段时间，她的容貌没有改变，看起来好像是睡着了一样，因为她的皮肤还是像雪一样白皙，脸色还是像血色一般红润，头发还是像黑檀木一样乌黑。","And now Snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she did not change, but looked as if she were asleep; for she was as white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony."
"然而，有一天，一个王子来到了森林里，在小矮人的家里住了一夜。他看到了高山上的棺材，见到了躺在里面美若天仙的白雪公主，也看到了上面的金字。然后，他对小矮人说道：“你们把这副棺材给我，作为回报，你们想要什么我都可以给你们。”但是七个小矮人回答道：“就算你把世界上所有的黄金给我们，我们都不会和它分离。”于是王子说道：“那你们把它作为礼物送给我吧。看不到白雪公主，我就活不下去了。我会尊重她、珍惜她，将她当成我最亲爱的人。”小矮人们听了王子这番话，不禁可怜起他来，于是便将棺材送给了他。","It happened, however, that a king’s son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs’ house to spend the night.He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters.Then he said to the dwarfs, “Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.”But the dwarfs answered, “We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.”Then he said, “Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white.I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession.”As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin."
"于是，王子让仆人们将棺材抬在肩膀上带走了。在途中，他们被一棵树桩绊了一下，棺材猛然一晃，于是，白雪公主吞下的那口毒苹果竟然从她的喉咙里呛了出来。不久，白雪公主便睁开眼睛，掀开了棺材盖子，坐了起来。她又活过来了。“哦，老天，我在哪里啊？”她喊道。王子大为高兴，说道：“你现在和我在一起。”随即告诉她发生了什么，并且说道：“在这世上，我最爱的就是你，嫁给我吧，让我带你回我父王的宫殿，你将会成为我的妻子。”","And now the King’s son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders.And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat.And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive.“Oh, heavens, where am I?” she cried.The King’s son, full of joy, said, “You are with me,” and told her what had happened, and said, “I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father’s palace, you shall be my wife.”"
"白雪公主欣然应允，和王子一起走了，两人举办了盛大辉煌的婚礼。白雪公主那邪恶的继母也受邀前去参加婚礼。她穿上一套漂亮的衣服，来到镜子前，说道：","And Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour.But Snow-white’s wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the Looking-glass, and said-"
"“墙上的魔镜，魔镜，谁是这个世界上最漂亮的女人？”","“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?”"
"魔镜回答道：","the glass answered-"
"“噢，王后，您是这个国家最美丽的女人。但是，我认为那位年轻的王后更美丽。”","“Oh, Queen, of all here the fairest art thou, But the young Queen is fairer by far as I trow.”"
"听完，这个邪恶的女人开始口吐诅咒，她非常沮丧，沮丧到了极点，手足无措。起初，她打算根本就不去参加婚礼，却又不得安宁，一定要去看看这位年轻的王后。她刚进入王宫，便认出了白雪公主，她僵在那里，又气愤、又害怕，一时动弹不得。这时，一双铁便鞋已经被放在了火上，仆人用铁钳将它夹到她面前。她被迫穿上灼热的铁鞋跳舞，直到她倒在地上死去。","Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly wretched, that she knew not what to do.At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young Queen.And when she went in she knew Snow-white; and she stood still with rage and fear, and could not stir.But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before her.Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance until she dropped down dead."
"玛琳姑娘","Maid Maleen"
"从前有一个国王，他的一个儿子想要娶一个大国的公主，公主名叫玛琳，长得非常美丽。因为玛琳的父亲打算将女儿嫁给另一个人，便拒绝了王子。可是，由于俩人彼此真心相爱，他们不愿意就此放弃对方，少女玛琳就对父亲说：“我不会也不想嫁给别人。”于是国王发怒了，他命人建起一座黑暗的高塔，日光和月光统统无法进去。高塔建好后，他说：“你将会被关在这里七年，到时候我再来看你是不是还是这么固执。”高塔内准备了足够她们七年生活的饮食，然后玛琳和她的侍女便被带了进去。四周都围起了墙，完全把她们和外界隔开了。她们坐在漆黑的塔里，分不清白天黑夜。王子常常在高塔周围转来转去，喊着她们的名字，可是声音却穿不透厚厚的墙壁。除了悲叹和怨恨，她们还能做什么呢？时间慢慢流逝，随着食物日渐减少，她们知道七年快要过去了。她们以为自己获救的时刻就要到了。可是，她们既听不到击锤的声音，也看不到有石头落下，少女玛琳感觉父亲好像已经把她忘记了。后来，她们的食物就只够维持一小段时间了，死亡在等待着她们。少女玛琳说：“我们必须做最后的尝试，看能不能打通墙壁。”她拿起切面包的刀子，用劲儿挖石头缝中的灰泥。她挖累了，就由侍女继续干。费了好大的力气，她们终于挖掉了一块石头，接着挖掉了第二块、第三块。三天过后，漆黑的塔里迎来了第一缕阳光。最后，墙壁的洞大到她们都能看到外面了。天空蓝蓝的，清风吹拂着她们的面颊。可是，周围的一切看起来真令人悲伤！她父亲的王宫已化作一片废墟，能够望得到的城镇和村庄也都毁于大火，广袤的田地变成了荒地，一个人影也看不到。等到洞口大到足够让她们钻出来时，侍女先跳了出来，接着是少女玛琳。可是，她们能去哪里呢？敌人毁灭了整个王国，赶走了国王，杀死了所有的百姓。她们向前赶路，想找到其他王国，可是到处都找不到一个可以安身的地方，也找不到一个可以给她们一点面包的人。她们饿极了，只得用荨麻树叶充饥。走了很长的路之后，她们终于来到了另一个王国，就四处找活干。可是，她们每敲开一家门，就会被打发走，没人同情她们。最后，她们走到一座大城市，来到了王宫。王宫的人也要赶她们走，可最后厨师收留了她们，让她们在厨房帮忙。","There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King; she was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful.As her father wished to give her to another, the prince was rejected; but as they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.”Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter.When it was finished, he said, “Therein shalt thou be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if thy perverse spirit is broken.”Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower, and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth.There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began.The King’s son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls.What else could they do but lament and complain?Meanwhile the time passed, and by the diminution of the food and drink they knew that the seven years were coming to an end.They thought the moment of their deliverance was come; but no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her.As they only had food for a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.”She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn.With great labour they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second, and a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out.The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around!Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible.When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed.But where were they to go?The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants.They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettles.When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere; but wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them.At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace.There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions."
"然而，那座王宫的王子正是和少女玛琳相爱的那个人。他的父亲已为他选择了另一位新娘，她不仅相貌丑陋，连心肠也一样狠毒邪恶。婚期已定了下来，新娘也到了。可是因为她长得实在太难看，便将自己关在房间里，不允许任何人看到她。少女玛琳只得把饭菜从厨房里端给她。新郎新娘去教堂成婚的日子到了，可新娘为自己的丑陋感到难为情，她担心露面后会受到百姓的讽刺和嘲笑。于是，她对少女玛琳说：“你走了大好运了。我扭伤了脚，不能走路。你就穿上我的婚纱，代替我去吧。这可是你最大的荣幸了！”可是，少女玛琳拒绝了她，说道：“不是我的荣耀我不想要。”新娘又拿金子给她，可也是徒劳。最后，她气愤地说：“你要是不服从我，我就要了你的命。我只需要说句话，你的人头就会落地。”于是，玛琳只好屈从了。她穿上新娘的华丽婚纱，戴上了她的所有珠宝首饰。当她步入王宫大厅时，所有人都被她的美貌惊呆了。国王对他的儿子说：“这就是我给你选的新娘，你带着她去教堂吧。”新郎也很震惊，他心想：“她真像我的玛琳啊，我真觉得她是玛琳，可玛琳已在塔里关了很久，也许已经死了。”他牵起她的手，领着她去了教堂。路边有一堆荨麻，玛琳说话了。","The son of the King in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen.His father had chosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked.The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already arrived; but because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen.When the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people.Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen thee.I have sprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets; thou shalt put on my wedding-clothes and take my place; a greater honour than that thou canst not have!”Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honour which is not suitable for me.”It was in vain, too, that the bride offered her gold.At last she said angrily, “If thou dost not obey me, it shall cost thee thy life.I have but to speak the word, and thy head will lie at thy feet.”Then she was forced to obey, and put on the bride’s magnificent clothes and all her jewels.When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the bride whom I have chosen for thee, and whom thou must lead to church.”The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.”He took her by the hand and led her to church.On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said,"
"“噢，荨麻草啊，小小的荨麻草，你怎么独自生长在这里？我还记得过去饥饿难耐时，我曾生吃了你，既没蒸也没炒。”","“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"王子问道：“你在说什么呢？”她回答说：“没什么，我只是想起了玛琳姑娘。”他很惊讶新娘竟认识玛琳，但没再说什么。当他们走到墓地旁边的小桥那里时，她又说话了。","“What art thou saying?” asked the King’s son.“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence.When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said,"
"“小桥啊，不要断，我是个假冒的新娘啊。”","“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"王子又问：“你在说什么呢？”她答道：“没什么，我只是想起了玛琳姑娘。”“你认识玛琳姑娘吗？”她回答说：“不认识，我怎么会认识她呢？我只是听说过她。”他们走到教堂门口时，她又开始说话。","“What art thou saying there?” asked the King’s son.“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”“Dost thou know Maid Maleen?”“No,” she answered, “how should I know her; I have only heard of her.”When they came to the church-door, she said once more,"
"“教堂的门梁啊，不要断裂，我是个假冒的新娘啊。”","“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"他问道：“你在说什么呢？”她回答说：“啊，我只是想起了玛琳姑娘。”这时，王子拿出一条珍贵的项链，戴在了新娘的脖子上，然后把搭扣扣好。接着，他们步入了教堂，在圣坛前，牧师将他们的手放在一起，为他们主持了婚礼。王子带着新娘回宫去，可一路上新娘一句话也没有说。当他们返回王宫后，她匆匆跑到新娘的房间里，脱下了华丽的婚纱，也摘下了所有的珠宝首饰，重新穿上自己的灰色外衣，只留下了那条新郎送给她的项链。","“What art thou saying there?” asked he.“Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp.Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them.He led her home, but she did not speak a single word the whole way.When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the bride’s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the bridegroom."
"夜幕降临了，新娘被领进新郎的房间里，她脸上蒙着面纱，以免新郎看穿她的诡计。所有人都离开后，他对她说：“你对路边的荨麻草说了什么？”","When the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince’s apartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception.As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What didst thou say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”"
"她问道：“对荨麻草？我不对荨麻草说话。”王子说：“要是你没有，那你就不是真正的新娘。”她想了一下，说道：“我得去找我的侍女，她记着我所有的事。”","“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”“If thou didst not do it, then thou art not the true bride,” said he.So she bethought herself, and said, “I must go out unto my maid, who keeps my thoughts for me.”"
"于是她便出去找到了少女玛琳。“死丫头，你对着荨麻草说了些什么？”“没说什么，只说了‘噢，荨麻草啊，小小的荨麻草，你怎么独自生长在这里？","She went out and sought Maid Maleen.“Girl, what hast thou been saying to the nettle?”“I said nothing but, Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"我还记得过去饥饿难耐时，我曾生吃了你，既没蒸也没炒。’”","I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"新娘赶忙跑回房间，说道：“我现在知道我对荨麻草说了些什么了。”于是她重复说了一遍刚刚听到的话。王子问道：“那我们过桥的时候你对小桥又说了些什么呢？”她答道：“对小桥？”“我没跟小桥说话啊。”“那你就不是真正的新娘。”","The bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard.“But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?” asked the King’s son.“To the foot-bridge?” she answered.“I don’t talk to foot-bridges.”“Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"于是她又说道：“我得去找我的侍女，她记得我的一切事情。”","She again said, “I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me,”"
"她跑出去找到少女玛琳：“死丫头，你对小桥说了些什么啊？”","And ran out and found Maid Maleen, “Girl, what didst thou say to the foot—bridge?”"
"“没说什么，只说了‘小桥啊，不要断，我是个假冒的新娘啊。’”","“I said nothing but, Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"新娘喊道：“你真该死！”但她还是匆匆跑回了房间，说：“我现在知道我对小桥说了些什么了。”她重复了一遍。“那你在教堂门口又说了些什么呢？”她回答说：“在教堂门口？我没在那里讲什么啊。”“那你就不是真正的新娘。”","“That costs thee thy life!” cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words.“But what didst thou say to the church-door?”“To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.”“Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"她又出去找到玛琳姑娘，说道：“死丫头，你在教堂门口说了些什么？”","She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?”"
"“没说什么，只说了‘教堂的门梁啊，不要断裂，我是个假冒的新娘啊。’”","“I said nothing but, Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"新娘喊道：“我真想拧断你的脖子！”她非常生气，但还是急忙回到了房间，说：“我知道我在教堂门口说了些什么。”她又重复了一遍。“我在教堂门口送给你的那条项链哪去了呢？”她答道：“什么项链？你没给我项链啊。”“我亲自给你戴上的，亲自扣紧了搭扣。你要是不知道这件事的话，你就不是真正的新娘。”王子一下子从她脸上扯掉了面纱，当看到她非常丑陋的面貌时，王子吓得向后退去，说道：“你怎么在这里？你是什么人？”","“That will break thy neck for thee!” cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words.“But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?”“What jewel?” she answered; “thou didst not give me any jewel.”“I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.”He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How comest thou here? Who art thou?”"
"“我是你的新娘，可是我怕人们看到我后会嘲笑我，就命令厨房的洗碗女仆穿上我的婚纱，代替我去教堂了。”王子问：“那个女孩在哪儿？我想见她，去把她带到这里来。”新娘出去后，告诉下人们那个洗碗女仆是个骗子，命令他们将她带到庭院，砍下她的头。下人们抓住了玛琳姑娘，想要把她拖出去。可玛琳声嘶力竭地呼喊救命，王子听到了她的声音，他匆忙跑出房间，命令他们立即放了这个女孩。下人们点上蜡烛，王子便看到女孩脖子上正戴着他在教堂门口送给她的项链。王子说：“你才是真正的新娘，是你和我去的教堂，跟我到房间里来。”等只剩下他们两个人的时候，王子说：“在去教堂的路上你提起了玛琳姑娘，她是我过去的心上人。要是我相信这一切都是真的，我觉得她就站在我面前，你和她简直一模一样。”她答道：“我就是玛琳姑娘，为了你，我在黑暗里被囚禁了七年，长久地忍受着饥渴，历尽了千辛万苦。然而，今天我终于重见天日了。我和你在教堂成了婚，我是你的合法妻子了。”于是，他们互相亲吻，一生过着幸福的生活。那个丑陋的新娘因所作所为被砍掉了头颅。","“I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.”“Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.”She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the courtyard and strike off her head.The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly.Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door.“Thou art the true bride, said he, “who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.”When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.”She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty.Today, however, the sun is shining on me once more.I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.”Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives.The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off."
"少女玛琳曾经被囚禁的那座高塔在那里又矗立了很长时间，孩子们经过时，都会唱一首歌。","The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,"
"“叮铃，叮铃，叮铃铃。是谁关在了高塔里？是一位公主，她坐在塔内，我无法见到，塔墙裂不了，石头穿不透。小汉斯啊，穿着你的小花衣，快一点，跟随我，跟随我。”","“Kling, klang, gloria.Who sits within this tower?A King’s daughter, she sits within, A sight of her I cannot win, The wall it will not break, The stone cannot be pierced.Little Hans, with your coat so gay, Follow me, follow me, fast as you may.”"

"白雪和红玫","Snow-White and Rose-Red"
"曾经，有一个贫穷的寡妇住在一间孤零零的小农舍里。在农舍前面，有一个花园，花园里种着两株玫瑰，一株开白玫瑰，一株开红玫瑰。寡妇有两个孩子，就像两株玫瑰一样，她们中一个名为白雪，另一个则叫红玫。和世界上所有的姐妹一样，她们心地善良，无忧无虑，忙碌而有活力。只不过，相较红玫，白雪显得更安静，更温和。红玫更喜欢在草地和田野上奔跑，找找鲜花，捉捉蝴蝶；而白雪呢，则会坐在家里陪妈妈，帮她做做家务，没事做时，就读书给妈妈听。","There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage.In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses.She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red.Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do."
"两个孩子特别要好，出去玩的时候总是手拉手。要是白雪说：“我们永远不会分开。”红玫就会回应道：“我们要一生一世在一起。”这时，她们的母亲也会补充道：“你们有什么东西要相互分享。”","The two children were so fond of each another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said, “We will not leave each other,” Rose-red answered, “Never so long as we live,” and their mother would add, “What one has she must share with the other.”"
"她们常常独自跑到森林里摘红浆果，没有一只野兽伤害她们，反而非常信任地接近她们。小野兔吃她们手里的菜叶，狍在她们身边啃青草，小鹿在他们身旁快乐地蹦跳，小鸟坐在树枝上，纵情欢唱。","They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully.The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew."
"她们从来没有发生过意外。如果她们在森林里玩得太晚，黑夜降临了，她们就会相依躺在青苔上，睡到第二天早晨。妈妈知道她们不会有危险，并不为她们担心。","No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account."
"一次，她们又在森林里过夜，当黎明将她们叫醒时，她们看到自己身边坐着一个穿着闪亮、洁白的衣服的漂亮小孩。小孩站起身来，非常友好地看着她们。但是一句话也没有说，就走进了森林里。她们往四周看了看，发现她们睡在离悬崖很近的地方，如果在昨夜的黑暗中多走几步的话，她们一定会掉下悬崖的。她们的妈妈告诉她们，那一定是一个保护好孩子的天使。","Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed.He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest.And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further.And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children."
"白雪和红玫把她们妈妈的小农舍打扫得十分干净，让人看了就觉得舒服。夏天，红玫负责打扫房子。每天早上，在妈妈醒来以前，她都从每一株玫瑰上摘下一支玫瑰花，并把花环放在妈妈的床边。冬天，白雪会生上火，并将水壶挂在炉子上。水壶是由铜打造的，如金子般泛着光，擦拭得十分明亮。夜晚，当雪花纷飞时，妈妈会说：“去，白雪，把门闩上。”随后，一家人围坐在火炉边，妈妈戴上眼镜，捧起一本很厚的书大声朗读，两个孩子坐在旁边纺线、聆听。一只羊羔卧在靠近她们的地上，她们身后的栖木上停着一只白鸽，它把头藏在了翅膀下。","Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it.In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree.In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin.The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished.In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, “Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,” and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and span.And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings."
"一个傍晚，她们还是像往常一样舒适地坐在一起，忽然有人敲门，似乎是想要进来。妈妈说道：“快，红玫，去开门，一定是个旅客，正在找地方过夜。”红玫走过去，打开了门闩，心想一定是个穷人，但不是，而是一只探着黑色大脑袋的熊。","One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in.The mother said, “Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.”Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door."
"红玫尖叫起来，立刻向后跳开，羊羔咩咩地叫，鸽子拍着翅膀，白雪藏到了妈妈的床下。然而，熊开口说道：“别怕，我不会伤害你们！我冻坏了，只想在你们身旁暖暖身子。”","Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed.But the bear began to speak and said, “Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm!I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.”"
"妈妈说道：“可怜的熊，在火边躺一会儿，只是要当心不要烧着你的皮毛。”随后她喊道：“白雪，红玫，出来吧，这只熊不会伤害你们，他没有恶意。”于是，她们便都出来了，羊羔和鸽子慢慢地接近熊，不再害怕他了。熊说：“这里，孩子们，帮我把皮毛上的雪扫掉吧。”于是，她们拿来了扫帚，帮熊把皮毛打扫干净，然后熊便躺在火堆旁，既满足又舒服地嗥叫。不久她们就和熊混熟了，开始和这位笨拙的客人玩起了把戏。她们用双手拽住熊的毛，拿脚踩在熊的背上，让熊翻过来滚过去，或用榛树条打熊，当熊嗥叫的时候，姐妹俩就大笑起来。但是熊一点儿也不生气，只有当她们太使劲的时候，他会叫道：“饶了我吧，孩子们。","“Poor bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.”Then she cried, “Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.”So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him.The bear said, “Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little;” so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably.It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest.They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed.But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, “Leave me alive, children,"
"白雪，红玫，你们会这样打死爱你们的人吗？”","Snowy-white, Rosy-red, Will you beat your lover dead?”"
"等到睡觉的时候，其他人都去睡了，妈妈对熊说道：“你可以躺在火炉边，这样就能免受严寒之苦了。”刚刚拂晓，两个孩子便放熊出去去，熊踏着白雪走进了森林里。","When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear, “You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.”As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest."
"从此以后，熊每天晚上都在同一时刻过来，躺倒在火炉边，任由两个孩子拿他开心，她们习惯了熊的陪伴，只要她们那长着黑毛的朋友还没到，就不会闩门。","Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived."
"春天来了，室外的一切都是绿色的。一天早上，黑熊告诉白雪：“我现在必须离开了，整个夏天，我都不能回来。”“亲爱的熊，你要去哪里呢？”白雪问。“我必须到森林里去，保卫我的宝藏，以防被邪恶的侏儒偷走。冬季天寒地冻，他们没办法到地面上来，只能在地下呆着。可是现在，太阳融化了冰雪，大地回暖，他们就钻出地面，出来刺探、偷盗东西。但凡他们偷到手、并且抬回洞穴的东西，都很难重见天日。”","When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white, “Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.”“Where are you going, then, dear bear?” asked Snow-white.“I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs.In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.”"
"熊要走了，白雪非常难过，她刚为熊打开门，熊便急匆匆地走出去，他的皮毛被门闩钩住，撕扯开来，白雪仿佛看见皮毛里面有金子在闪闪发光，但她不确定。熊飞快地跑开，不久就消失在树林里了。","Snow-white was quite sorry for his going away, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it.The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees."
"不久以后，妈妈让两个孩子去森林拾柴火。她们在森林里发现一棵倒在地上的大树，有什么东西在树干旁边的草地上蹦来蹦去，但是她们看不清是什么。她们走过去，看到那是一个小矮人，有一张干枯的脸和一尺长的雪白胡子。他的胡子尖夹在了树的裂缝里，小家伙只能像拴了绳子的狗一样蹦来蹦去，不知道该怎么办。","A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get fire-wood.There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was.When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long.The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping backwards and forwards like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do."
"他用炯炯有神的红眼睛瞪着两个女孩儿，叫道：“你们站在那里干什么？就不能过来帮我个忙吗？”红玫问道：“你在那里干什么，小矮人？”“你这个好打听的笨蛋！”小矮人回答道，“我本想劈开这棵大树，用小木头烧饭。如果用那么厚的木头烧饭，我们每个人所需的那一丁点食物早就糊了，我们可不像你们这些粗鲁贪婪的家伙要吞进去那么多东西。我刚把楔子安全地钉进去，一切都如我所愿，可是这块烂木头太滑了，突然断碎裂开来，树干迅速合起来，我来不及拔出漂亮的白胡子，现在树干夹得很紧，我走不了了，而你们这两个愚蠢、光滑的小白脸还在那里笑！啊！你们太可恶了！”","He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried, “Why do you stand there?Can you not come here and help me?”“What are you about there, little man?” asked Rose-red.“You stupid, prying goose!” answered the dwarf; “I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.The little bit of food that one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk.I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the wretched wood was too smooth and suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight in and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh!Ugh!how odious you are!”"
"两个孩子竭尽全力，还是没能将小矮人的胡子拔出来，胡子被夹得太紧了。“我去叫个人来。”红玫说。“你这个木讷的笨蛋！”小矮人咆哮道，“你为什么要去叫人？就你们两个对我来说已经太多了，你们就想不出更好的办法吗？”“别不耐烦。”白雪说道，“我来帮你。”她从口袋里拿出一把剪刀，把小矮人的胡子尖给剪掉了。","The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast.“I will run and fetch some one,” said Rose-red.“You senseless goose!” snarled the dwarf; why should you fetch some one?You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?”“Don’t be impatient,” said Snow-white, “I will help you,” and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard."
"小矮人刚刚获救，就从树根旁拎起一个装满金子的包，对自己咕哝道：“两个粗野的家伙，把我漂亮的胡子剪掉一截。我咒你们噩运连连！”然后他把包搭在背上，看也不看两个孩子就走了。","As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself, “Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard.Bad luck to you!” and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children."
"过了一段时间，白雪和红玫想去钓一条鱼来做菜。她们来到小河边，她们看到一个像大蚂蚱一样的东西朝水边跳去，好像要跳进去一样。她们跑过去，发现正是那个小矮人。“你要去哪里？”红玫说，“你该不会是要下水吧？”“我又不是傻瓜！”小矮人叫道，“你没看到这条该死的鱼想把我拽下去吗？”小矮人正坐在那里钓鱼，不幸一阵风吹过，把他的胡子和鱼线缠在了一起，这时，恰好有一条大鱼咬了诱饵，这弱小的家伙没有力气把鱼拉出来，鱼占了上风，把小矮人拉向自己。他抓住所有的芦苇和草，但无济于事，他被迫听任鱼的摆布，马上就要有被拖下水的危险。","Some time after that Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish.As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.They ran to it and found it was the dwarf.“Where are you going?” said Rose-red; “you surely don’t want to go into the water?”“I am not such a fool!” cried the dwarf; don’t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?”The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had twisted his beard with the fishing-line; just then a big fish bit, and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him.He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water."
"两个女孩恰好在这时赶到，她们紧紧地抓住小矮人，想把他的胡子从鱼线上拆开，但无济于事，胡子和鱼线紧紧地缠在一起了。她们无能为力，只好拿出剪刀，剪去了小矮人的一截胡子，于是小矮人的胡子又短了一小截。小矮人见状尖叫道：“你们两个没用的东西，给人毁容，还讲不讲礼貌？把我的胡子尖剪掉还不够吗？现在你们把我胡子最好的部分剪掉了。我还怎么见人啊。我希望你们赶快给我滚，滚得连鞋子也丢掉才好！”然后他拿出一袋放在灌木丛里的珍珠，一句话也不多说，便拖着袋子走了，消失在一块石头后面。","The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together.Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost.When the dwarf saw that he screamed out, “Is that civil, you toad-stool, to disfigure one’s face?Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard?Now you have cut off the best part of it.I cannot let myself be seen by my people.I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!”Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without saying a word more he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone."
"这事发生不久之后，妈妈让两个孩子去镇上买针和线、蕾丝和丝带。她们走啊走，走到了一片散布着巨石的荒地。她们注意到有一只大鸟在空中盘旋着，慢悠悠地在她们的头上飞了一圈又一圈，它越飞越低，最后停在了不远处的一块岩石上。紧接着，她们就听到一声响亮、可怜的叫喊。她们跑过去，惊恐地看见老鹰抓住了她们的老相识小矮人，正准备把他带走。","It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons.The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn here and there.Now they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far off.Directly afterwards they heard a loud, piteous cry.They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off."
"两个孩子十分可怜小矮人，立即上前紧紧抱住他，拽住老鹰很长时间不放手，最终老鹰放开了它的猎物。小矮人这次被吓得不轻，可是，当他稍有缓和，他便用尖锐的嗓音叫道：“你们就不能当心一点吗！你们拽着我的棕色外套，把它拽得破破烂烂，全都是洞，你们这两个无药可救、笨手笨脚的东西！”随后，他便拿起一个装满宝石的袋子，滑进了岩石下自己的洞里。两个女孩这时已经对小矮人毫无谢意的态度习以为常了，她们继续走自己的路，去镇子上买东西。","The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice, “Could you not have done it more carefully!You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you helpless clumsy creatures!”Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole.The girls, who by this time were used to his thanklessness, went on their way and did their business in the town."
"当她们回家再次路过这块荒地时，小矮人正在把袋子里的宝石往一块干净的地方倒，他非常惊讶，因为他没有想到那么晚了还会有人路过这里。傍晚的夕阳照在这些漂亮的宝石上，闪闪发光、五颜六色，煞是好看，两个女孩儿看着它们，一动不动。小矮人那灰白的脸色被气得通红，他大声喊道：“你们为什么瞪眼站在那里？”小矮人还在那里骂个不休，这时，从森林里传来一声怒吼，随即便又一只黑熊向他们扑过来。小矮人吓得跳起来，可是他来不及回到自己的洞穴了，因为黑熊已经近在咫尺。小矮人从心底里感到恐惧，喊道：“亲爱的熊先生，求你饶了我，我把我所有的财宝都给你，看，就是地上的这些漂亮珠宝！饶我一命，像我这样瘦小干枯的家伙，您能得到什么呢？我还不够您塞牙缝儿呢。来，你吃那两个恶毒的女孩吧，她们是您的两小份佳肴，肥得像小鹌鹑一样。看在老天的份上，吃了她们吧！”黑熊丝毫不理会他的话，给了这个恶毒的家伙一巴掌，小矮人便一动不动了。","As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late.The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colors so beautifully that the children stood still and looked at them.“Why do you stand gaping there?” cried the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage.He was going on with his bad words when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest.The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not get to his cave, for the bear was already close.Then in the dread of his heart he cried, “Dear Mr. Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there!Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I?you would not feel me between your teeth.Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!”The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again."
"两个女孩已经跑掉了，但黑熊冲她们叫道：“白雪和红玫，不要害怕，等一等，我要和你们一起走。”白雪和红玫听出了他的声音，便等着他，当黑熊追上她们的时候，他的熊皮突然掉在了地上，站在那里的是一个穿着一身金色衣服的英俊男子。他说道：“我是王子，被那个恶毒的小矮人施了魔法，他偷走了我的宝藏，还把我变成一只野蛮的熊，在森林里跑来跑去，只有他死了，我才能重获自由。现在他遭到了应有的惩罚。”","The girls had run away, but the bear called to them, “Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.”Then they knew his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there, a handsome man, clothed all in gold.“I am a King’s son,” he said, “and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death.Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.”"
"白雪嫁给了王子，而红玫嫁给了王子的弟弟，他们平分了小矮人藏在自己洞里的大宝藏。老妈妈和她的孩子们一起安宁幸福地生活了许多年。她把两株玫瑰带着，种在自己的窗前。每年，它们都会绽放出最美丽的红玫瑰和白玫瑰。","Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave.The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years.She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red."
"爱人罗兰","Sweetheart Roland"
"从前有个女人，她是个不折不扣的女巫。女巫有两个女儿；一个丑陋邪恶，女巫很是喜欢，因为是她亲生的女儿，一个美丽善良，女巫却心存厌恶，因为那是她的养女。养女有一条漂亮的围裙，这让另一个女儿又羡慕又嫉妒。她便告诉母亲她一定要得到那条围裙不可。“小声点儿，我的孩子，”老妇人说，“你肯定会拥有它的。你那位姐姐早就该死了，趁她今晚睡着了，我就去把她的头砍下来。只是留心你要睡在床里边，推她睡在床沿。”若不是那时可怜的女孩正好站在角落，听到了所有的事情，她一定会死的。","There was once on a time a woman who was a real witch and had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated, because she was her step-daughter.The step-daughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron.“Be quiet, my child,” said the old woman, “and thou shalt have it.Thy step-sister has long deserved death, to-night when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off.Only be careful that thou art at the far-side of the bed, and push her well to the front.”It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything."
"她一整天都不敢出门，到了该睡觉的时候，女巫的亲生女儿为了要睡在床里边，抢先上了床，但是等她睡着了，养女轻轻将她推到床沿，自己睡在里面那个位置，紧贴着墙壁。夜里，老妇人右手提了柄斧头蹑手蹑脚地潜进屋子，用左手摸了摸看床沿上是否有人躺着，随即双手握紧斧头，砍下了她亲生女儿的头。","All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bed-time had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall.In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone was lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s head off."
"女巫走后，女孩起来去找她的爱人罗兰，敲他家的门。他一出来，她就对他说：“听我说，亲爱的罗兰，我们必须赶快逃走；我的继母想要杀我，却误杀了她的亲生女儿。天亮了以后，她见到自己所做的事，我们就完了。”“但是，”罗兰说，“我劝你拿走她的魔杖，否则她要是追我们，我们肯定逃不掉。”少女取了魔杖，还拿了死去女孩的头在地上滴了三滴血，一滴滴在床前，一滴滴在厨房，还有一滴滴在了楼梯上。然后她便同她心爱的人逃走了。第二天早上，老巫婆醒来后便叫她的亲生女儿，想要给她那条围裙，可是亲生女儿没有出现。女巫大叫：“你在哪里呀？”“这儿，在楼梯上，我正扫地呢。”第一滴血回答。老妇人走出来，但是没看见有人在楼梯上，又叫道：“你在哪里呀？”“在厨房里，我正取暖呢。”第二滴血喊。她走进厨房，但是没找到人。她便又大叫：“你在哪里呀？”“哎，在床上，我正睡着呢。”第三滴血喊道。她走进房间，来到床前。她在那里看见了什么？她的亲生孩子，头已被她砍去，浸在血泊之中。女巫暴跳如雷，一跃到了窗前，由于她可以看到很远的地方，于是便看到了她的养女正同爱人罗兰一起匆匆地离去。“逃也没有用。”她喊道，“就算你们已经先走了很远，也逃不出我的手心。”她穿上她那一步千里的魔靴，跨一步就相当于走了一个小时的路程，很快就追上了他们。然而，女孩见老妇正大步流星地朝她赶来，便用她的魔杖将她的爱人罗兰变作一泊湖水，自己变作在湖心游动的鸭子。女巫在岸边站定，向湖里投面包屑，千方百计引诱鸭子；不过鸭子并不上钩，到了晚上，老妇只好一无所成地回了家。女巫一走，女孩和她的爱人罗兰就变回了他们原来的样子，走了整整一夜，直至天明。女孩继而将自己化作一朵美丽的花朵，盛开在欧石南篱笆中，她的爱人罗兰则变为一个小提琴手。不久，女巫就大步赶上了他们，向乐师说道：“亲爱的乐师，我能否摘下那朵美丽的鲜花？”“啊，可以。”他答道，“你摘的时候，我来给你演奏。”她清楚地知道那朵花是谁，正着急地蹑手蹑脚走进篱笆里去摘花，乐师就演奏起来，而不管她自己愿不愿意，女巫都不由自主地跳起舞来，原来那是种魔舞。他弹奏得越快，她就跳得越猛，棘刺刮破了她身上的衣服，刺进她的肉里，扎得她鲜血直流，因为乐师没有停止音乐，她只有跳到倒在地上死了为止。","When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who was called Roland, and knocked at his door.When he came out, she said to him, “Hear me, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my step-mother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child.When daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.”“But,” said Roland, “I counsel thee first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us.”The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs.Then she hurried away with her lover.When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come.Then the witch cried, “Where art thou?”“Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,” answered the first drop of blood.The old woman went out, but saw no one on the stairs, and cried again, “Where art thou?”“Here in the kitchen, I am warming myself,” cried the second drop of blood.She went into the kitchen, but found no one.Then she cried again, “Where art thou?”“Ah, here in the bed, I am sleeping.” cried the third drop of blood.She went into the room to the bed.What did she see there?Her own child, whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood.The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her step-daughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland.“That shall not serve you,” cried she, “even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.”She put on her many league boots, in which went an hour’s walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook them.The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it.The witch placed herself on the shore, threw bread-crumbs in, and gave herself every possible trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come.On this the girl and her sweetheart Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole night until daybreak.Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart Roland into a fiddler.It was not long before the witch came striding up towards them, and said to the musician, “Dear musician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?”“Oh, yes,” he replied, “I will play to you while you do it.”As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, for she well knew who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance.The quicker he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground."
"他们得救后，罗兰说：“现在我就去我父亲那儿，安排我们的婚礼。”“那么，这段时间里，我就呆在这儿等你。”女孩说，“我会把自己变成一块红色的石头路标，那样就没人认得出我了。”然后罗兰离开了，女孩站在田野里变成一块红色的路标，等待她的爱人。但是当罗兰到了家，他却中了别的女人的圈套，劝诱得他完全忘了少女。可怜的女孩在那里等了很久很久，但是最终，由于罗兰始终没有回来，女孩伤心欲绝，将自己变作一朵花，想道：“一定会有人走这条路，把我踩死。”","When they were delivered, Roland said, “Now I will go to my father and arrange for the wedding.”“Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for thee,” said the girl, “and that no one may recognize me, I will change myself into a red stone land-mark.”Then Roland went away, and the girl stood like a red land-mark in the field and waited for her beloved.But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who prevailed on him so far that he forgot the maiden.The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought, “Some one will surely come this way, and trample me down.”"
"可是发生了这么件事，一个牧羊人在这片田野里放羊，看到了那朵花，因为它实在太美，便摘下来，随身带着，把它放进他的箱子里。从那时起，怪事便一件件在牧羊人的家里发生了。当他清早起身，所有的工作都已做毕：房间打扫过了，桌子和长凳擦干净了，壁炉里的火生好了，水也打好了；中午，他回到家的时候，碗筷已然摆齐，桌上备好了一顿丰盛的午餐。他难以想象这些事怎么会发生，因为他从来不见家里有半个人影，况且这房子也没人能藏得下。他当然对这样悉心的照料甚是高兴，可依然还是觉得非常害怕，便去找一个女先知求解。女先知说：“有魔法在作用，找一天大清早，你听听房间里是不是有东西在动，若是你看到什么，不要管它，只要扔块白布罩在它上面，魔法就会失效。”","It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field, and saw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and laid it away in his chest.From that time forth, strange things happened in the shepherd’s house.When he arose in the morning, all the work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire on the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served.He could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it.He was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice.The wise woman said, “There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is moving in the room, and if thou seest anything, let it be what it may, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.”"
"牧羊人照她说的做了，第二天，天刚破晓，他就看见箱子打开，那朵花出来了。他迅速朝花儿跳过去，扔了块白布将它盖住。幻化之术旋即失了灵，站在他面前的是个美丽的女孩，女孩向牧羊人承认自己就是那朵花，在此之前她一直为他收拾房子。她向牧羊人讲了自己的故事，牧羊人喜欢她，便问她愿不愿意嫁给他，但女孩答道：“不行。”因为女孩还想由始至终忠于她的爱人罗兰，尽管罗兰已经抛弃了她，不过女孩还是答应牧羊人不离开，将来还为他料理家务。","The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned, he saw the chest open, and the flower come out.Swiftly he sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it.Instantly the transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who owned to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this time she had attended to his housekeeping.She told him her story, and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she answered, “No,” for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart Roland, although he had deserted her, but she promised not to go away, but to keep house for the shepherd for the future."
"庆祝罗兰婚礼的日子就快到了，根据那个村庄的传统习俗，宣布所有的姑娘都要出席婚礼，为新人歌唱祝福。忠贞的少女听闻，难过得心都要碎了，她不愿到那儿去，可是其他女孩过来，把她带走了。轮到她唱歌时，她就向后退，直到最后，她成了唯一一个还没有唱歌的人，不能推辞了。她唱起了歌，歌声传到了罗兰的耳朵里，他跳起来惊呼：“我认得这声音，那才是真正的新娘，我再也不要其他人了！”所有种种他忘却的，从他记忆里消失的，都一下子重新回到了他心里。就这样忠贞的少女同她心爱的罗兰举行了婚礼，熬过痛苦过上了幸福的日子。","And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated, and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the bridal pair.When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls came and took her.When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse.But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s ears, he sprang up and cried, “I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!”Everything he had forgotten, and which had vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart.Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began."
"不来梅镇的音乐家","The Bremen Town-Musicians"
"从前有个人养了一头驴子，多年来，驴子总是不知疲倦地把装满玉米的麻袋背去磨坊。但渐渐地，他的体力衰退，变得越来越不适合干活了。此时，主人开始考虑如何节省开支，但是驴子一见大势不妙，便向不来梅镇逃去。“在那里，”他想，“我一定可以成为小镇的音乐家。”走了一阵后，驴子看到一只猎狗正躺在路边，喘着粗气，好像已经跑得精疲力尽了。“你喘什么呢，大家伙？”驴子问道。","A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn-sacks to the mill indefatigably for many a long year; but his strength was going, and he was growing more and more unfit for work.Then his master began to consider how he might best save his keep; but the donkey, seeing that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out on the road to Bremen.“There,” he thought, “I can surely be town-musician.”When he had walked some distance, he found a hound lying on the road, gasping like one who had run till he was tired.“What are you gasping so for, you big fellow?” asked the donkey."
"“啊，”猎狗回答说，“我年纪大了，一天比一天虚弱，再也无法捕猎了，我的主人想要杀掉我，所以我逃了出来，可是我要靠什么为生呢？”","“Ah,” replied the hound, “as I am old, and daily grow weaker, and no longer can hunt, my master wanted to kill me, so I took to flight; but now how am I to earn my bread?”"
"“让我来告诉你，”驴子说道，“我打算去不来梅镇，想到那儿做个小镇音乐家。你和我一起去吧，也当个音乐家。我来演奏鲁特琴，你来敲铜鼓。”","“I tell you what,” said the donkey, “I am going to Bremen, and shall be town-musician there; go with me and engage yourself also as a musician.I will play the lute, and you shall beat the kettledrum.”"
"猎狗同意了，于是两人便一起上路了。","The hound agreed, and on they went."
"不久，他们碰到了一只猫，猫坐在路上，脸上满是忧愁。“喂，老家伙，发生什么事了？”驴子问道。","Before long they came to a cat, sitting on the path, with a face like three rainy days!“Now then, old shaver, what has gone askew with you?” asked the donkey."
"“死到临头谁还能高兴得起来？”猫回答说。“因为我现在越来越老了，牙齿也不锋利了，比起到处抓老鼠，我更愿在火炉边坐坐或转转，我的女主人想要淹死我，我便逃了出来。但现今却没有好的建议。我该到哪里去呢？”","“Who can be merry when his neck is in danger?” answered the cat.“Because I am now getting old, and my teeth are worn to stumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about after mice, my mistress wanted to drown me, so I ran away.But now good advice is scarce.Where am I to go?”"
"“和我们一起去不来梅吧。你了解夜曲，你可以做一个小镇音乐家。”","“Go with us to Bremen.You understand night-music.You can be a town-musician.”"
"猫觉得这个主意不错，便和他们一起上路了。之后，三个逃亡者来到了一座农家庭院前，在那里，一只公鸡正坐在大门上，用尽浑身力气啼叫着。“你的叫声从始至终都没停过。”驴子说道，“发生什么事了啊？”","The cat thought well of it, and went with them.After this the three fugitives came to a farm-yard, where the cock was sitting upon the gate, crowing with all his might.“Your crow goes through and through one,” said the donkey.“What is the matter?”"
"“我一直在预言好天气，因为今天是圣母清洗小耶稣衬衫并要烘干它们的日子。”公鸡说道，“但是星期天客人们要到家里来，所以主妇毫无怜悯之意，吩咐厨师她打算明天用我来烧汤，今天晚上我的头就要被切下来了。”现在趁我还叫得出来，我要叫出最高音。”","“I have been foretelling fine weather, because it is the day on which Our Lady washes the Christ-child’s little shirts, and wants to dry them,” said the cock; “but guests are coming for Sunday, so the housewife has no pity, and has told the cook that she intends to eat me in the soup to-morrow, and this evening I am to have my head cut off.Now I am crowing at full pitch while I can.”"
"“噢，顶红冠的朋友，”驴子说道，“跟我们一起远走高飞吧。我们要去不来梅镇。不论在什么地方，你都能找到比死亡好得多的东西：你有一副好嗓音，如果我们一同演奏音乐，一定会非常棒！”","“Ah, but red-comb,” said the donkey, “you had better come away with us.We are going to Bremen; you can find something better than death everywhere: you have a good voice, and if we make music together it must have some quality!”"
"公鸡同意了这个计划，于是他们四个便一同上路了。但是一天之内，他们可没有办法赶到不来梅镇，夜幕降临时，他们来到了一片森林，打算在这里过夜。驴子和猎狗躺在一棵大树下，猫和公鸡则睡在树枝上，但公鸡飞到了树顶上，他在那里最安全。睡觉前，他环顾四周，发现远方有一点闪亮的小火光，他叫醒了他的伙伴，告诉他们他看到了灯光，不远处一定有房子。驴子说道：“如果是这样，我们最好起来继续赶路，住在这里实在不怎么样。”猎狗则想着能有几根带肉的骨头。","The cock agreed to this plan, and all four went on together.They could not, however, reach the city of Bremen in one day, and in the evening they came to a forest where they meant to pass the night.The donkey and the hound laid themselves down under a large tree, the cat and the cock settled themselves in the branches; but the cock flew right to the top, where he was most safe.Before he went to sleep he looked round on all four sides, and thought he saw in the distance a little spark burning; so he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, for he saw a light.The donkey said, “If so, we had better get up and go on, for the shelter here is bad.”The hound thought that a few bones with some meat on would do him good too!"
"于是他们朝着亮着灯光的地方走去，很快，灯光越来越亮、越来越大，他们来到了一幢灯火通明的强盗的屋子跟前。驴子最为高大，便走向窗边向里张望。","So they made their way to the place where the light was, and soon saw it shine brighter and grow larger, until they came to a well-lighted robber’s house.The donkey, as the biggest, went to the window and looked in."
"“你看见了什么，我的灰马？”公鸡问道。“我看见了什么？”驴子回道，“一张桌子上放满了好吃好喝的东西，强盗们正坐在桌边尽情享用呢。”“那正是为我们准备的。”公鸡说。“是的，是的。啊，我多希望我们能在那里啊！”驴子说道。","“What do you see, my grey-horse?” asked the cock.“What do I see?” answered the donkey; “a table covered with good things to eat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.”“That would be the sort of thing for us,” said the cock.“Yes, yes; ah, how I wish we were there!” said the donkey."
"接着，动物们开始一起商量要怎么把强盗们赶出房子，最后，他们想出了一个计策。驴子要把他的前蹄搁在窗台上，猎狗则要跳到驴子的背上，猫要爬到猎狗的身上，最后公鸡要飞上来，坐在猫的头上。","Then the animals took counsel together how they should manage to drive away the robbers, and at last they thought of a plan.The donkey was to place himself with his fore-feet upon the window-ledge, the hound was to jump on the donkey’s back, the cat was to climb upon the dog, and lastly the cock was to fly up and perch upon the head of the cat."
"一切准备就绪，一声令下，他们开始共同演奏他们的乐曲：驴嘶、狗吠、猫叫、公鸡打鸣，接着他们从窗户外闯进屋里，玻璃被撞得哗啦作响。听到这可怕的嘈杂声，强盗们都跳了起来，心想一定是鬼来了，吓得要命，向森林里逃去。现在，四个同伴坐在桌边，心满意足地吃着剩下的食物，仿佛接下来的一个月都要斋戒一样。","When this was done, at a given signal, they began to perform their music together: the donkey brayed, the hound barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed; then they burst through the window into the room, so that the glass clattered!At this horrible din, the robbers sprang up, thinking no otherwise than that a ghost had come in, and fled in a great fright out into the forest.The four companions now sat down at the table, well content with what was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a month."
"吃完了晚饭后，这四个游方艺人便熄灭了灯，各自根据自己的习性找了个适合的地方睡下了。驴子躺在院子里的草堆上，猎狗睡在门后，猫蜷缩在炉灰旁的壁炉旁，公鸡则栖身于房梁上。长途跋涉让他们都疲惫不堪，所以很快就睡着了。","As soon as the four minstrels had done, they put out the light, and each sought for himself a sleeping-place according to his nature and to what suited him.The donkey laid himself down upon some straw in the yard, the hound behind the door, the cat upon the hearth near the warm ashes, and the cock perched himself upon a beam of the roof; and being tired from their long walk, they soon went to sleep."
"午夜过后，强盗们远远地看见他们屋子里的灯光已经熄灭了，一切都显得很平静，强盗头子便说：“我们不应该被吓得这样魂不附体。”于是就命令其中一个强盗前去检查屋子的情况。","When it was past midnight, and the robbers saw from afar that the light was no longer burning in their house, and all appeared quiet, the captain said, “We ought not to have let ourselves be frightened out of our wits;” and ordered one of them to go and examine the house."
"打探情况的人发现一切都很平静，便走进厨房想点根蜡烛，看到猫那亮晶晶、闪着火光的眼睛，他还以为是燃烧着的煤球，就拿着火柴准备去点火。然而猫可不明白这个玩笑，跳到强盗的脸上，又是吐唾沫又是挠。强盗被吓坏了，连忙跑去后门，但是躺在那里的狗跳了起来，一口咬在他的腿上；而当他跑过院子时，经过了稻草堆，稻草堆里的驴子用后蹄迅速踢了他一脚。公鸡也被这喧闹声吵醒了，变得十分兴奋，在房梁上向下高喊：“喔喔喔！”","The messenger finding all still, went into the kitchen to light a candle, and, taking the glistening fiery eyes of the cat for live coals, he held a lucifer-match to them to light it.But the cat did not understand the joke, and flew in his face, spitting and scratching.He was dreadfully frightened, and ran to the back-door, but the dog, who lay there sprang up and bit his leg; and as he ran across the yard by the straw-heap, the donkey gave him a smart kick with its hind foot.The cock, too, who had been awakened by the noise, and had become lively, cried down from the beam, “Cock-a-doodle-doo!”"
"接着，强盗以他最快的速度逃了回去，向强盗头子汇报说：“啊，屋子里坐着一个恐怖的巫婆，她把唾沫吐在我脸上，还用长长的爪子抓我的脸；在门旁站着一个带刀的男人，把我的腿刺伤了；院子里躺着一只黑乎乎的怪兽，他用木棍打我；而在屋顶上坐着一个法官，他喊道：‘把那个恶棍带到我这里来！’所以我用最快的速度逃了出来。”","Then the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain, and said, “Ah, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, who spat on me and scratched my face with her long claws; and by the door stands a man with a knife, who stabbed me in the leg; and in the yard there lies a black monster, who beat me with a wooden club; and above, upon the roof, sits the judge, who called out, ‘Bring the rogue here to me!’ so I got away as well as I could.”"
"从此以后，强盗们再也不敢回到那幢房子里去了，而对于不来梅镇的四个音乐家来说，这房子再适合不过，他们再也不想离开这里了。到现在，这个故事还在被人们口口相传。","After this the robbers did not trust themselves in the house again; but it suited the four musicians of Bremen so well that they did not care to leave it any more.And the mouth of him who last told this story is still warm."

"曾经有一个贫穷的女人，生下了一个男孩。男孩生来便有一块胎记，因而有人预言，当这个男孩长到十四岁时，便会娶公主为妻。不久之后，国王恰好来到这个村庄。但是没有人知道他是国王。当他问起这里有什么新鲜事时，村民们回答道：“这里刚添了一个带有胎记的男婴，凡是有此胎记的孩子命都很好。同时也有人预言说这个孩子在十四岁的时候会娶公主为妻。”","There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son; and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the King’s daughter for his wife.It happened that soon afterwards the King came into the village, and no one knew that he was the King, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, “A child has just been born with a caul on; whatever any one so born undertakes turns out well.It is prophesied, too, that in his fourteenth year he will have the King’s daughter for his wife.”"
"这个国王心肠非常狠毒，并且对这个预言非常愤懑。他装出一副和蔼可亲的样子来到孩子的父母面前，假惺惺地说道：“可怜的人啊，把你们的孩子交给我抚养，我一定会好好照顾他的。”起初，孩子的父母拒绝了他的请求，但是这个陌生人为这个孩子开出了一大笔的黄金作为交换条件。孩子的父母心想：“这个孩子真是好运气，一切都会对他有利的。”最终，他们同意了这个陌生人的请求，并把孩子交给了他。","The King, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, “You poor people, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.”At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought, “It is a luck-child, and everything must turn out well for it,” they at last consented, and gave him the child."
"国王把这个孩子放进了一只箱子里，带着它来到了河边，河水很深，随即把箱子扔进了水里，心想：“我的女儿可以不用嫁给这个不是自己看中的未婚夫了。”","The King put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water; then he threw the box into it and thought, “I have freed my daughter from her unlooked-for suitor.”"
"然而，这只箱子并没有沉到水底，而是像船一样漂浮在水面上。甚至没有一滴水渗进箱子里去。距离国王统治国度的首都两英里的地方有一个磨坊，这只箱子就在磨坊的堤坝处被卡住了。一个磨坊工人恰好站在那里，他注意到了这个箱子，以为箱子里会有财宝，便用钩子将它打捞上来。但是，当他打开箱子时，发现里面有一个非常活泼的新生儿。他把男婴带回去给磨坊主夫妇看，由于磨坊主夫妇没有孩子，见到男婴非常高兴，说：“这真是上天的恩赐啊！”这个弃婴在他们的精心呵护照料下成长，变得十分善良。","The box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it.And it floated to within two miles of the King’s chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a stand-still at the mill-dam.A miller’s boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively.He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said, “God has given him to us.”They took great care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness."
"有一天风暴来袭，国王恰好来到这个磨坊里。他询问磨坊主夫妇那个高个子的年轻人是否是他们的儿子。“不是的，”他们回答，“他是一个弃婴。十四年前，他被装在一个箱子里漂到了磨坊堤坝下，是磨坊工人把他从水里救上来的。”","It happened that once in a storm, the King went into the mill, and he asked the mill-folk if the tall youth was their son.“No,” answered they, “he’s a foundling.Fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water.”"
"国王立刻意识到这不是别人，正是自己以前扔进水里的幸运男孩，他说道：“好心的人们，可以让这个年轻人给王后送一封信吗？作为回报，我愿赏他两枚金币。”磨坊夫妇回答道：“愿意听从国王陛下的吩咐。”于是，他们便让这个男孩准备好。于是，国王提笔给王后写信，信中写道：“这个男孩一旦把信送到，便让人把他杀了，并且埋葬好。这些都必须在我回来前做好。”","Then the King knew that it was none other than the luck-child which he had thrown into the water, and he said, “My good people, could not the youth take a letter to the Queen; I will give him two gold pieces as a reward?”“Just as the King commands,” answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness.Then the King wrote a letter to the Queen, wherein he said, “As soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be killed and buried, and all must be done before I come home.”"
"男孩拿了信便出发了，但是他迷路了，到了傍晚，他来到了一片大森林中。在黑暗里，他看到了一点微弱的亮光，于是他朝灯光走过去，并找到了一间农舍。他走进农舍，看到有位老妇人独自坐在火堆边。看到这个男孩，老妇人一惊，说道：“你从哪里来，到哪里去？”“我从磨坊来，”男孩回答，“想要到王后那里去，我带了一封信给她。但是因为我在森林里迷路了，我想在这里借宿一晚。”“可怜的孩子，”老妇人说，“你走进了恶人的贼窝里，等他们回来，会杀了你的。”“让他们过来。”男孩说，“我不怕。但是我现在非常疲惫，再也走不动了。”说完，他往一张板凳上一躺，便睡着了。","The boy set out with this letter; but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest.In the darkness he saw a small light; he went towards it and reached a cottage.When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone.She started when she saw the boy, and said, “Whence do you come, and whither are you going?”“I come from the mill,” he answered, “and wish to go to the Queen, to whom I am taking a letter; but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.”“You poor boy,” said the woman, “you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you.”“Let them come,” said the boy, “I am not afraid; but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther:” and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep."
"没过多久，就来了几个强盗，他们恶狠狠地询问躺在那里的陌生男孩是谁。“啊，”老妇人说，“这是一个在森林里迷路了的无辜的孩子。因为可怜他，我才让他进来。他必须去给王后送一封信。”强盗拆开那封信读了一遍，信上写着这个男孩一旦到达就必须被处死。这些狠心的强盗也开始可怜起这个男孩。于是，他们的首领撕掉了这封信，写了另外一封信。信中写道，男孩一旦到达，就立即娶公主为妻。然后，他们让这个男孩在板凳上安心睡到了第二天早晨。等他醒来后，他们把第二封信交给了他，并为他指明了正确的道路。","Soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there?“Ah,” said the old woman, “it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in; he has to take a letter to the Queen.”The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death.Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the King’s daughter.Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way."
"当王后收到这封信，并且读过后，便遵照信里所说的，筹备了一场豪华的婚宴，将国王的女儿嫁给了幸运的男孩，并且因为这个男孩英俊潇洒、通情达理，公主和他生活得既快乐又满足。","And the Queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the King’s daughter was married to the luck-child, and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment."
"过了一段时间，国王回到了自己的宫殿，看到预言实现了，这个幸运男孩真的娶了自己的女儿。“这是怎么回事？”国王说，“我在信里给了一个截然不同的命令。”","After some time the King returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the luck-child married to his daughter.“How has that come to pass?” said he; “I gave quite another order in my letter.”"
"于是，王后把信交给他，说让他自己看看信中是怎么写的。国王读了这封信，十分清楚自己的命令被调换成了另一个。国王质问这个年轻人把自己托付给他的信怎么样了，为什么他带来的是另一封信。“我什么都不知道。”男孩回答，“一定是我在森林里睡着的那一晚被更换的。”国王非常气愤，说道：“不能凡事都随着你自己的心愿，要娶我女儿的人都必须到去地狱去，从魔鬼的头上拔下三根金色头发。如果你能拿回我想要的东西，你就可以和我女儿在一起。”国王希望通过这个方法永远摆脱这个年轻人。但是这个幸运男孩回答道：“我会带回金色头发的，我不怕魔鬼！”随即告别了国王和公主，踏上了自己的旅途。","So the Queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for himself what was written in it.The King read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it.“I know nothing about it,” answered he; “it must have been changed in the night, when I slept in the forest.”The King said in a passion, “You shall not have everything quite so much your own way; whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from the head of the devil; bring me what I want, and you shall keep my daughter.”In this way the King hoped to be rid of him for ever.But the luck-child answered, “I will fetch the golden hairs, I am not afraid of the Devil;” thereupon he took leave of them and began his journey."
"这个年轻人沿路来到了一个大城镇上，城门前的守卫问他是干什么的，知道些什么。“我无所不知。”幸运的男孩说。“那你帮我们一个忙，”守卫说，“如果你能告诉我们为什么市场上的喷泉，原来流的都是美酒，现在干涸了，甚至连水都不再流出来了？”“你们会知道的，”幸运的男孩说，“只要等我回来。”","The road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.“I know everything,” answered the luck-child.“Then you can do us a favour,” said the watchman, “if you will tell us why our market-fountain, which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water?”“That you shall know,” answered he; “only wait until I come back.”"
"之后，他继续向前走，来到另一个城镇。城门上的守卫也问他是干什么的，知道些什么。“我无所不知。”男孩说。“那你可以帮我们一个忙，告诉我们为什么镇上的一棵树，以前可以结金苹果，而现在却连树叶都没有了？”“你们会知道的，”男孩回答，“只要等我回来。”","Then he went farther and came to another town, and there also the gatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew.“I know everything,” answered he.“Then you can do us a favour and tell us why a tree in our town which once bore golden apples now does not even put forth leaves?”“You shall know that,” answered he; “only wait until I come back.”"
"之后，他又继续往前赶，来到了一条宽大的河流面前，他必须渡过这条河。渡船工问他是干什么的，知道些什么。“我无所不知。”男孩回答。“那你可以帮我一个忙。”渡船工说，“告诉我为什么我必须不停地来回摆渡，从不停歇？”“你会知道的。”男孩回答，“只要等我回来。”","Then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go.The ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.“I know everything,” answered he.“Then you can do me a favour,” said the ferryman, “and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards and forwards, and am never set free?”“You shall know that,” answered he; “only wait until I come back.”"
"他渡过河，就发现了地狱的入口。里面一片漆黑，烟雾缭绕，魔鬼不在家，但魔鬼的外婆坐在一张硕大的扶手椅上。“你想要什么？”魔鬼的外婆对男孩说，她的表情看上去并不那么邪恶。“我想要魔鬼头上的三根金色头发。”男孩说，“否则我就要失去我的妻子了。”“你要得太多了，”她说，“如果魔鬼回到家，发现了你，你就没命了。但是我很同情你，让我看看我能否帮你一把。”","When he had crossed the water he found the entrance to Hell.It was black and sooty within, and the Devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.“What do you want?” said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked.“I should like to have three golden hairs from the devil’s head,” answered he, “else I cannot keep my wife.”“That is a good deal to ask for,” said she; “if the devil comes home and finds you, it will cost you your life; but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot help you.”"
"她把男孩变成了一只蚂蚁，说道：“爬到我衣服的褶皱里，在那里，你会很安全的。”“好的。”男孩说，“现在看来一切都很顺利。但除此之外，我还想问三件事：为什么原先流淌着酒的喷泉现在干涸了，甚至连水都流不出来？为什么曾经结金苹果的树现在连叶子也不长了？为什么渡船工必须来回渡河，从不停歇？”","She changed him into an ant and said, “Creep into the folds of my dress, you will be safe there.”“Yes,” answered he, “so far, so good; but there are three things besides that I want to know: why a fountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water; why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth leaves; and why a ferry-man must always be going backwards and forwards, and is never set free?”"
"“这些问题很难呀。”她回答，“你别出声，等我拔下魔鬼的三根头发，你注意听他怎么说就是了。”","“Those are difficult questions,” answered she, “but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs.”"
"夜幕降临，魔鬼回来了。他一进家门就发现气味不对。“我闻到了人的气味。”他说，“这里有点不对劲儿。”然后他开始到处窥探，每一个角落都不放过，但是他什么也没有找到。魔鬼的外婆骂了他。“我刚刚把这里打扫了。”她说，“把所有的东西都摆放整齐。现在你又把这里弄乱了，你鼻子老是闻得到人味。赶紧坐下，吃你的晚饭。”","As the evening came on, the devil returned home.No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.“I smell man’s flesh,” said he; “all is not right here.”Then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything.His grandmother scolded him.“It has just been swept,” said she, “and everything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again; you have always got man’s flesh in your nose.Sit down and eat your supper.”"
"魔鬼吃饱喝足后十分疲惫，把头枕在他外婆的大腿上，没过多久就睡着了，呼噜声和喘息声很大。这时，老妇人抓住魔鬼的一根金头发，拔了下来，并把头发放在自己的身边。“噢！”魔鬼喊道，“你在干什么？”“我刚才做了一个噩梦。”外婆回答，“于是我抓住了你的头发。”“那你梦到了什么呢？”魔鬼问道。“我梦见在市场上有一个喷泉，以前流淌着美酒，现在干涸了，甚至连水都流不出来，你知道这是为什么吗？”“噢！啊！只是他们不知道。”魔鬼回答道，“在井里的大石头下坐着一只癞蛤蟆，如果他们把它杀掉，美酒就会重新流出来了。”","When he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in his grandmother’s lap, and before long he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing heavily.Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down near her.“Oh!” cried the devil, “what are you doing?”“I have had a bad dream,” answered the grandmother, “so I seized hold of your hair.”“What did you dream then?” said the devil.“I dreamed that a fountain in a market-place from which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water would flow out of it; what is the cause of it?”“Oh, ho!if they did but know it,” answered the devil; “there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well; if they killed it, the wine would flow again.”"
"他再次进入了梦乡，鼾声如雷，直将窗户震得发抖。这时，魔鬼的外婆揪下了魔鬼的第二根头发。“啊！你干什么？”魔鬼生气地喊道。“不要生气。”外婆说，“我是梦中揪了你的头发。”“这次你又梦见了什么？”魔鬼问。“我梦见在某个王国里，有一棵结金苹果的树，但是现在连叶子都不长了。你觉得这是为什么呢？”“噢！只是他们不知道。”魔鬼回答道，“有一只老鼠在啃树根，如果他们杀了那只老鼠，果树就会重新结金苹果。但是如果这只老鼠继续啃下去，树就会彻底枯死了。但是你做噩梦不许再折腾我了。如果你再把我吵醒，我就扇你耳光！”","He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook.Then she pulled the second hair out.“Ha!what are you doing?” cried the devil angrily.“Do not take it ill,” said she, “I did it in a dream.”“What have you dreamt this time?” asked he.“I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there stood an apple tree which had once borne golden apples, but now would not even bear leaves.What, think you, was the reason?”“Oh!if they did but know,” answered the devil.“A mouse is gnawing at the root; if they killed this they would have golden apples again, but if it gnaws much longer the tree will wither altogether.But leave me alone with your dreams: if you disturb me in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear.”"
"外婆好声好气地哄他，直到他又睡着了，打起呼噜来。这时，她揪住第三根金头发，并把它拔了下来。这个魔鬼一跃而起，大声吼叫，要不是他的外婆再一次让他安静下来，他可能就要打外婆了，外婆说：“谁能保证不做噩梦呢？”“这一次，你的噩梦又是什么呢？”魔鬼非常好奇地问道。“我梦见一个摆渡工，他抱怨自己必须一直来回摆渡，永不停歇。这是为什么呢？”“啊！那个傻瓜。”魔鬼回答道，“假如有人过去，想要渡河，摆渡工必须把船桨塞给他，往后那个人就必须划渡船，摆渡工就自由了。”由于外婆已经拔出了三根头发，也得到了三个问题的答案，便不再打扰魔鬼，他一直睡到天亮。","The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored.Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out.The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said, “Who can help bad dreams?”“What was the dream, then?” asked he, and was quite curious.“I dreamt of a ferry-man who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other, and was never released.What is the cause of it?”“Ah!The fool,” answered the devil; “when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free.”As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old serpent alone, and he slept until daybreak."
"当魔鬼再次出门时，老妇人将蚂蚁从自己衣服的褶皱里放出来，并且将它恢复成了幸运的男孩的原形。“这是给你的三根头发。”老妇人说，“我想你已经听到魔鬼是怎么回答你的三个问题了？”“是的，”男孩回答，“我听到了，而且会用心记住的。”“你已经得到你想要的东西了。”老妇人说，“现在你可以上路了。”他感谢老妇人帮助他得到了所需的东西，然后离开了地狱，为所有事都迎刃而解感到心满意足。","When the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant out of the folds of her dress, and gave the luck-child his human shape again.“There are the three golden hairs for you,” said she.“What the Devil said to your three questions, I suppose you heard?”“Yes,” answered he, “I heard, and will take care to remember.”“You have what you want,” said she, “and now you can go your way.”He thanked the old woman for helping him in his need, and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately."
"当他来到摆渡工面前时，摆渡工期待着他承诺的答案。“先把我渡过去。”幸运男孩说，“之后我会告诉你如何获得自由。”当他到达对岸后，他把魔鬼的建议告诉了船夫：“下一次有人过来，想要渡河，你就把船桨塞到他手里。”","When he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer.“Ferry me across first,” said the luck-child, “and then I will tell you how you can be set free,” and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil’s advice: “Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand.”"
"他继续走，来到了那个有不结果的大树的小镇上，那里的守卫也盼望着得到答案。于是，他便把从魔鬼那里听来的话告诉了他：“把啃树根的老鼠杀掉，这棵树就会重新结金苹果了。”守卫感谢了他，作为酬劳，送给了这个男孩两头驮着金子的驴，跟着他一起回去。","He went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer.So he told him what he had heard from the devil: “Kill the mouse which is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden apples.”Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him."
"最后，他来到了井干涸的那个城镇。他把魔鬼说的话告诉了守卫：“在井里的大石头下有一只癞蛤蟆，你必须找到它，并且杀死它，井里就会重新流淌出大量的美酒。”守卫感谢他，又送给他两头驮着金子的驴。","At last he came to the town whose well was dry.He told the watchman what the devil had said: “A toad is in the well beneath a stone; you must find it and kill it, and the well will again give wine in plenty.”The watchman thanked him, and also gave him two asses laden with gold."
"最后，这个幸运的孩子回家见到妻子，妻子再次见到他、听说他无往不利，十分高兴。他带来国王要求的三根魔鬼的金头发。当看到四头驮着金子的驴之后，国王非常满意，于是说道：“现在所有的条件都满足了，我的女儿是你的了。但是告诉我，亲爱的女婿，这些金子是哪里来的？这可是一笔大钱啊！”“有人把我摆渡过一条河，”他回答，“我在那里得到了这些金子，河岸上全是金子，而不是沙子。”“我也可以去拿一些回来吗？”国王如饥似渴地问道。“你想要多少就拿多少。”他回答，“河边有个摆渡工，让他把你摆渡过河，在河的那一边，你就可以一麻袋一麻袋装金子了。”贪婪的国王急忙出发了。他来到河边，召唤摆渡工把自己送过河。摆渡工来了，让国王上船。当他们到达对岸时，摆渡工将船桨塞进国王的手里，自己跳下了船。从此国王不得不在河上撑船，这是他罪有应得。或许他现在还在渡船？如果真是这样，那也是因为再没有人接过他手里的船桨了。","At last the luck-child got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything.To the King he took what he had asked for, the devil’s three golden hairs, and when the King saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said, “Now all the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter.But tell me, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from?this is tremendous wealth!”“I was rowed across a river,” answered he, “and got it there; it lies on the shore instead of sand.”“Can I too fetch some of it?” said the King; and he was quite eager about it.“As much as you like,” answered he.“There is a ferry-man on the river; let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side.”The greedy King set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferry-man to put him across.The ferry-man came and bade him get in, and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang out.But from this time forth the King had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins.Perhaps he is ferrying still?If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him."
"青蛙王子","The Frog-King, or Iron Henry"
"很久以前，人们的愿望还能实现。有一位国王，他的女儿们长得都很漂亮，但最小的女儿长得最漂亮，连太阳都深深地被她吸引了。每次太阳看见她，都对她的美貌感到惊诧。离国王的宫殿不远处，有一片幽暗的大森林。森林里有一棵老菩提树，树下有一口井。天气热的时候，小公主就会到森林里去，坐在清凉的泉水旁。当她无聊时，她就会拿出一个金球，抛向空中再接住。这个球是她最喜爱的玩具。","In old times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face.Close by the King’s castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King’s child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything."
"有一次，金球并没有落到小公主伸出的小手上，而是掉到远处，径直滚到了井里。小公主眼睁睁地看着金球滚到井里，消失了。井水很深，深得看不见底。为此，小公主哭了起来，哭声越来越大，怎样都止不住。正当她痛哭时，听到有人说：“你有什么烦恼啊，小公主？连石头都被你的哭声打动了。”她朝着声音传来的方向望去，看到一只青蛙，从水里探出了它那又大又丑陋的脑袋。","Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess’s golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.The King’s daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.On this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted.And as she thus lamented some one said to her, “What ails thee, King’s daughter?Thou weepest so that even a stone would show pity.”She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its thick, ugly head from the water."
"小公主说道：“啊，游泳健将，是你吗？我哭是因为我的金球掉进井里了。”","“Ah! old water-splasher, is it thou?” said she; “I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.”"
"青蛙回答说：“安静些，别哭了。我能帮你。不过，我要是给你取回了玩具，你拿什么报答我呢？”小公主说：“亲爱的青蛙，你想要什么都可以——我的衣裳、我的珠宝，甚至我戴着的这顶金冠。”","“Be quiet, and do not weep,” answered the frog, “I can help thee, but what wilt thou give me if I bring thy plaything up again?”“Whatever thou wilt have, dear frog,” said she—“My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.”"
"青蛙答道：“我不在乎你的衣裳、珠宝或是金冠。但是，如果你肯喜欢我，让我做你的玩伴，和你一起坐在你的小桌前，用你的小金盘子吃饭，用你的小杯子喝水，还要在你的小床上睡觉——要是你答应了，我就下去帮你取回金球。”","The frog answered, “I do not care for thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, or thy golden crown, but if thou wilt love me and let me be thy companion and play-fellow, and sit by thee at thy little table, and eat off thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy little cup, and sleep in thy little bed—if thou wilt promise me this I will go down below, and bring thee thy golden ball up again.”"
"小公主说：“噢，行。只要你能帮我把球拿回来，我会满足你所有的愿望。”小公主心想：“这只蠢青蛙在胡说八道什么啊！它应该生活在水里，和其他青蛙一起呱呱叫。它怎么可能和人类做朋友！”","“Oh yes,” said she, “I promise thee all thou wishest, if thou wilt but bring me my ball back again.”She, however, thought, “How the silly frog does talk!He lives in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and can be no companion to any human being!”"
"听到小公主的承诺，青蛙便一头扎进水里。不一会儿，青蛙游出了水面，嘴里衔着金球。它把球扔到了草地上。又看到心爱的玩具，小公主很开心。她捡起金球就跑开了。青蛙喊道：“等等，等等。带着我啊。我跑得没你快。”可是，无论青蛙怎样大声叫喊，都无济于事。小公主根本不听它喊叫。她跑回王宫，很快就把这只可怜的青蛙忘了。青蛙只得再回到井里去。","But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.The King’s daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it.“Wait, wait,” said the frog.“Take me with thee.I can’t run as thou canst.”But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could?She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again."
"第二天，小公主和国王以及大臣们一起坐在桌旁吃饭。当她吃她小金盘里的饭菜时，有一个东西顺着大理石楼梯，扑哧扑哧地爬了上来。爬到顶部后，它敲了敲门，喊道：“小公主，小公主，替我打开门。”小公主跑过去，想看看是谁在外面。可是，她打开门后，却看到一只青蛙坐在门前。她砰的一声，飞快地关上了门。然后，她又坐回桌旁，可心里却很害怕。国王清楚地看出小公主很慌张，他问道：“我的孩子，你为什么这么害怕啊？难道外面有个巨人，要抓走你吗？”小公主答道：“啊，没有。外面没有巨人，只有一只让人厌恶的青蛙。”","The next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, “Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.”She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it.Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened.The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, “My child, what art thou so afraid of?Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry thee away?”“Ah, no,” replied she.“It is no giant but a disgusting frog.”"
"“青蛙来找你做什么呢？”“啊，亲爱的父亲，昨天我坐在森林里的井边玩耍时，我的金球掉进了井里。我为此大哭起来，那只青蛙便帮我取回了金球。在它的一再要求下，我答应让它做我的玩伴。我没想到它竟然能从井里爬出来！现在它就在门外，想进来找我。”","“What does a frog want with thee?”“Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water.And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water!And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.”"
"这时，青蛙又敲起门来，喊道：","In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,"
"“小公主！小公主啊！","“Princess!youngest princess!"
"替我打开门！","Open the door for me!"
"你难道忘了","Dost thou not know what thou saidst to me"
"昨天你在清凉的泉水旁许下的承诺了吗？","Yesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?"
"小公主，小公主啊！","Princess, youngest princess!"
"替我打开门！”","Open the door for me!”"
"国王听后，说：“你一定要履行自己许下的诺言。去把它带进来吧。”小公主走过去打开了门，青蛙一跃就跳了进来。它跟随着小公主，一步一步地来到了她的椅子前。它蹲在那儿，说道：“把我抱上去，坐在你身旁。”小公主磨磨蹭蹭的，最后国王命令她把青蛙抱上去。青蛙被抱到椅子上之后，它又想要到桌子上。到了桌子上后，它说：“把你的小金盘子移过一点来，这样，我们就能一起进餐了。”小公主照做了。但很显然，她并不是心甘情愿这么做的。青蛙享受着美食，可小公主却都觉得，几乎每一口都难以下咽。最后，青蛙说：“我吃饱了，也满足了。我现在累了，带我去你的小房间里吧。铺好你柔软的小床，我们一起躺下睡觉吧。”","Then said the King, “That which thou hast promised must thou perform.Go and let him in.”She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair.There he sat and cried, “Lift me up beside thee.”She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it.When the frog was once on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, “Now, push thy little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.”She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her.At length he said, “I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into thy little room and make thy little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.”"
"小公主哭了起来。她害怕这只冰冷的青蛙，也不想碰它。可现在，它却要在自己那漂亮、干净的小床上睡觉。国王生气了，说：“在你遇到困难时，它帮助了你，你不应该过后就瞧不起它。”于是，小公主用两根手指拎起青蛙，带它到了楼上，放到一个角落里。可是，当小公主躺到床上时，青蛙跳到她跟前，说：“我累了，我要和你一样睡一觉。把我抱上床，不然我就去告诉国王。”小公主非常生气，她抓起青蛙，狠狠地朝墙上扔去。她说：“闭嘴，你这只可恶的青蛙。”可是，当青蛙落到地上时，它忽然变成了一位王子，长着一双漂亮眼睛。按照国王的旨意，他成了小公主亲爱的伴侣和丈夫。他告诉小公主，他被一个邪恶的女巫施了魔法，除了小公主外，没人能把它从井里救出来。明天，他们就一起前往他的王国。然后，他们一起睡了。第二天早上，当太阳唤醒他们时，一辆由八匹白马拉着的马车来到了王宫。白马头上点缀着白色的鸵鸟毛，身上套着金链子。车后站着王子忠诚的随从亨利。主人变成青蛙后，忠诚的亨利就一直伤心不已。他让人在胸前安上了三个铁箍，以免太过悲伤而心碎。马车要带着王子回到他的王国。忠诚的亨利把王子和公主扶进车内，他自己又回到车后面。主人得救了，他满心欢喜。他们赶了一段路，王子听到身后传来爆裂声，好像有什么东西破裂了。他转过头，喊道：“亨利，马车出问题了。”","The King’s daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed.But the King grew angry and said, “He who helped thee when thou wert in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by thee.”So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner.But when she was in bed he crept to her and said, “I am tired, I want to sleep as well as thou, lift me up or I will tell thy father.”Then she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall.“Now, thou wilt be quiet, odious frog,” said she.But when he fell down he was no frog but a King’s son with beautiful kind eyes.He by her father’s will was now her dear companion and husband.Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that tomorrow they would go together into his kingdom.Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King’s servant Faithful Henry.Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness.The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom.Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance.And when they had driven a part of the way the King’s son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken.So he turned round and cried, “Henry, the carriage is breaking.”"
"“不，主人，不是马车。是我胸前的一个铁箍发出的声音。你被变成了青蛙，囚禁在井里，我太难过了，就在胸前安装了铁箍。”在他们回去的途中，又传来两声东西破裂的声音。每次王子都以为是马车出问题了。其实是忠诚的亨利崩断胸前的铁箍发出的声音，因为他的主人获救了，而且还找到了幸福。","“No, master, it is not the carriage.It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.”Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King’s son thought the carriage was breaking; but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy."
"没有双手的姑娘","The Girl Without Hands"
"从前有一个磨坊主，他的家业逐渐败落了，除了磨坊和磨坊后面的一棵大苹果树之外，家里什么也没有了。一次，他去森林里砍柴，一个他陌生老人朝他走过来，说：“你何必那么辛苦地打柴呀？我能让你变成富翁，条件是你把磨坊后面的东西送给我。”磨坊主想：“那里除了我的苹果树外就没有什么了吧？”他便说：“好的。”还给那个陌生老人写了一份承诺书。可老人却嘲讽地笑了，说道：“三年后我就来带走属于我的东西。”然后就离开了。磨坊主回家后，他的妻子走过来问：“开磨坊的，告诉我家里忽然从哪儿来的这么一笔横财啊？所有的箱子和柜子都一下子装满了钱；可没人给我们送钱来啊，我不知道这一切是怎么回事。”他答道：“这些钱是我在森林里遇到的一个陌生人给的，他答应给我一大笔钱。我呢，作为回报，就答应给他磨坊后的东西；我们当然可以把那棵大苹果树给他啊。”“啊，我的丈夫啊！”妻子听后大惊失色，说道：“他一定是个魔鬼！他指的不是苹果树，而是我们的女儿啊，她当时正在磨坊后面扫院子呢。”","A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and had nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind it.Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an old man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and said, “Why dost thou plague thyself with cutting wood, I will make thee rich, if thou wilt promise me what is standing behind thy mill?”“What can that be but my apple-tree?” thought the miller, and said, “Yes,” and gave a written promise to the stranger.He, however, laughed mockingly and said, “When three years have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me,” and then he went.When the miller got home, his wife came to meet him and said, “Tell me, miller, from whence comes this sudden wealth into our house?All at once every box and chest was filled; no one brought it in, and I know not how it happened.”He answered, “It comes from a stranger who met me in the forest, and promised me great treasure.I, in return, have promised him what stands behind the mill; we can very well give him the big apple-tree for it.”“Ah, husband,” said the terrified wife, “that must have been the devil!He did not mean the apple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill sweeping the yard.”"
"磨坊主的女儿不仅漂亮而且是个虔诚的教徒，她三年的时间里一直笃信上帝，没有违犯任何戒律。三年过去了，魔鬼来领走她的日子到了，她将自己沐浴得干干净净，还用粉笔在自己周围画了一个圈。魔鬼早早地就来了，但他却无法靠近她。他气愤地对磨坊主说：“把水都拿走，让她没办法再沐浴，不然我就拿她没办法了。”磨坊主很害怕，便照做了。第二天早上魔鬼又来了，可姑娘的双手早已被泪水冲洗干净了。魔鬼又无法靠近她，非常气愤地说：“砍下她的双手，否则我就制服不了她了。”磨坊主很震惊，回答说：“我怎么能砍下自己孩子的双手呢？”于是魔鬼威胁他，说道：“如果你不照做，你就是我的了，我会把你抓走的。”父亲很惊恐，便答应照他说的做。于是他走到女儿跟前，说：“我的孩子啊，我要是不砍下你的双手，魔鬼就要把我带走了，我很害怕，就答应了他。帮我度过难关吧，原谅我伤害你。”她答道：“亲爱的父亲，你按意愿做吧，我是你的孩子。”于是，她伸出了双手，让父亲砍下来。魔鬼第三天又来了，但姑娘已经哭了许久，残肢处满是泪水，所以还是很干净。于是，他只得放弃，对她无计可施。","The miller’s daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived through the three years in the fear of God and without sin.When therefore the time was over, and the day came when the Evil-one was to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle round herself with chalk.The devil appeared quite early, but he could not come near to her.Angrily, he said to the miller, “Take all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to wash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her.”The miller was afraid, and did so.The next morning the devil came again, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite clean.Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to the miller, “Cut her hands off, or else I cannot get the better of her.”The miller was shocked and answered, “How could I cut off my own child’s hands?”Then the Evil-one threatened him and said, “If thou dost not do it thou art mine, and I will take thee thyself.”The father became alarmed, and promised to obey him.So he went to the girl and said, “My child, if I do not cut off both thine hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror I have promised to do it.Help me in my need, and forgive me the harm I do thee.”She replied, “Dear father, do with me what you will, I am your child.”Thereupon she laid down both her hands, and let them be cut off.The devil came for the third time, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that after all they were quite clean.Then he had to give in, and had lost all right over her."
"磨坊主对女儿说：“我因为你才得到了这么多钱财，我会好好照顾你一辈子的。”但是她却答道：“我不能呆在家里，我要离开这儿，善良的人们会在我需要的时候帮助我的。”于是，她让人把断手绑在后背上，一大早就动身上路了，她走了一整天，一直走到了天黑。后来，她来到了国王的御花园前，借着月亮的光线她看见了很多长着漂亮果实的大树，但她进不去，因为花园四周围绕着一条河。因为她走了一整天，又什么都没吃，便感到饥饿难耐，姑娘心想：“啊，我要是能到花园里吃点水果该多好啊，不然我真要饿死了！”于是她双膝跪下，向上帝祈祷起来。忽然，一个天使出现了，在水中筑了一座堤坝，壕沟里的水便渐渐变干了，这样姑娘就能走过去了。天使陪伴她一起走进了花园。她看到一棵树上结着好看的梨子，可这些梨是有数的。她走近梨树，实在忍不住饥饿，便张嘴吃了树上的一个梨，只吃了一个。可花匠还是看到了，由于天使站在姑娘身边，花匠便有些害怕，他心想姑娘是个神灵吧，就没有出声，既不敢喊叫，也不敢和她说话。姑娘吃完梨子就心满意足了，然后走到树丛中藏了起来。花园的主人国王第二天早上来到了这里，他一数梨子，发现少了一个，梨子也没落在树下，而是不见了，国王便问花匠怎么回事。花匠答道：“昨晚来了一个神灵，她没有双手，张嘴吃掉了一个梨子。”国王说：“这神灵是怎么渡水过来的呀，她吃完梨子又到哪里去了呢？”花匠回答说：“一个身穿雪白色衣服的人从天而降，筑了一座水坝，这样神灵就能走过去了。因为那人肯定是个天使，我就有些害怕，什么也不敢问，也没出声。神灵吃完梨子后就走了。”国王说：“要是真像你说的那样，今晚我就和你一起看守。”","The miller said to her, “I have by means of thee received such great wealth that I will keep thee most delicately as long as thou livest.”But she replied, “Here I cannot stay, I will go forth, compassionate people will give me as much as I require.”Thereupon she caused her maimed arms to be bound to her back, and by sunrise she set out on her way, and walked the whole day until night fell.Then she came to a royal garden, and by the shimmering of the moon she saw that trees covered with beautiful fruits grew in it, but she could not enter, for there was much water round about it.And as she had walked the whole day and not eaten one mouthful, and hunger tormented her, she thought, “Ah, if I were but inside, that I might eat of the fruit, else must I die of hunger!”Then she knelt down, called on God the Lord, and prayed.And suddenly an angel came towards her, who made a dam in the water, so that the moat became dry and she could walk through it.And now she went into the garden and the angel went with her.She saw a tree covered with beautiful pears, but they were all counted.Then she went to them, and to still her hunger, ate one with her mouth from the tree, but no more.The gardener was watching; but as the angel was standing by, he was afraid and thought the maiden was a spirit, and was silent, neither did he dare to cry out, or to speak to the spirit.When she had eaten the pear, she was satisfied, and went and concealed herself among the bushes.The King to whom the garden belonged, came down to it next morning, and counted, and saw that one of the pears was missing, and asked the gardener what had become of it, as it was not lying beneath the tree, but was gone.Then answered the gardener, “Last night, a spirit came in, who had no hands, and ate off one of the pears with its mouth.”The King said, “How did the spirit get over the water, and where did it go after it had eaten the pear?”The gardener answered, “Some one came in a snow-white garment from heaven who made a dam, and kept back the water, that the spirit might walk through the moat.And as it must have been an angel, I was afraid, and asked no questions, and did not cry out.When the spirit had eaten the pear, it went back again.”The King said, “If it be as thou sayest, I will watch with thee to-night.”"
"夜幕降临后，国王便来到了花园，他还带来了一位能通灵的神父。三人一起坐在树下看守着。午夜时分姑娘爬出了树丛，她走到树前，又张嘴吃了一个梨子，身旁还是站着白衣天使。这时，神父朝他们走去，说：“你来自天堂还是人间呢？你是个神灵还是个凡人呢？”姑娘答道：“我不是神灵，而是一个不幸的凡人，除了上帝，所有人都抛弃了我。”国王说：“哪怕全世界都抛弃了你，我也不会抛弃你的。”他带着姑娘来到了王宫，因为姑娘既美丽又善良，国王真心地爱上了她，命人为她做了一双银制的手，还娶她为妻。","When it grew dark the King came into the garden and brought a priest with him, who was to speak to the spirit.All three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched.At midnight the maiden came creeping out of the thicket, went to the tree, and again ate one pear off it with her mouth, and beside her stood the angel in white garments.Then the priest went out to them and said, “Comest thou from heaven or from earth?Art thou a spirit, or a human being?”She replied, “I am no spirit, but an unhappy mortal deserted by all but God.”The King said, “If thou art forsaken by all the world, yet will I not forsake thee.”He took her with him into his royal palace, and as she was so beautiful and good, he loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her, and took her to wife."
"一年后，国王要外出作战了，他拜托母亲照顾好年轻的王后，他说：“如果王后要生育了，好好照顾她、看护她，也要马上派人送信告诉我。”后来，王后生下了一个漂亮的男孩。于是，老母亲立即写信，把这个好消息告诉了国王。可是，信使途中在河边休息的时候，因为长途跋涉实在劳累，所以睡着了。这时魔鬼来了，他一直伺机要伤害善良的王后，便把信调换了，信中说王后生了一个妖怪。国王看到信后既震惊又苦恼，但他还是回信嘱咐他们要好好照顾、看护王后，直到他回到宫中。信使带着信往回赶路，可又在同一地点休息，而且又睡着了。这时，魔鬼又来了，他把信调换了，信中说要处死王后和她的孩子。老母亲收到信后很是惊讶，实在不敢相信。她再次给国王写了一封信，却得到了一样的回复，因为魔鬼每次都把信对调了，最后一封信里甚至还写道，要留下王后的舌头和眼睛以证明她的确被行刑了。","After a year the King had to take the field, so he commended his young Queen to the care of his mother and said, “If she is brought to bed take care of her, nurse her well, and tell me of it at once in a letter.”Then she gave birth to a fine boy.So the old mother made haste to write and announce the joyful news to him.But the messenger rested by a brook on the way, and as he was fatigued by the great distance, he fell asleep.Then came the Devil, who was always seeking to injure the good Queen, and exchanged the letter for another, in which was written that the Queen had brought a monster into the world.When the King read the letter he was shocked and much troubled, but he wrote in answer that they were to take great care of the Queen and nurse her well until his arrival.The messenger went back with the letter, but rested at the same place and again fell asleep.Then came the Devil once more, and put a different letter in his pocket, in which it was written that they were to put the Queen and her child to death.The old mother was terribly shocked when she received the letter, and could not believe it.She wrote back again to the King, but received no other answer, because each time the Devil substituted a false letter, and in the last letter it was also written that she was to preserve the Queen’s tongue and eyes as a token that she had obeyed."
"可是，老母亲一想到要杀死这个无辜的人便忍不住落泪，她命人夜里牵来一头雌鹿，割下了它的舌头，挖出了它的眼睛，保存起来。然后她对王后说：“我不能按国王的吩咐杀了你，可你不能继续呆在这里了。带着你的孩子远走高飞吧，永远别再回来。”可怜的王后把孩子绑在背上，满眼泪水地离开了。她走到了一片荒凉的大森林里，双膝跪下，向上帝祷告起来，天使忽然出现在她面前，带她来到一间小屋前，门前写着“每个人都可免费居住”的标牌。一个白衣姑娘从屋里走出来，说：“欢迎你，王后陛下。”然后将王后领进屋去。他们从王后背上解下小男孩，把他抱到王后跟前给他喂奶，又把孩子放在了一张漂亮的小床上。可怜的王后说：“你怎么知道我是王后呢？”白衣姑娘答道：“我是上帝派来的一位天使，是来照顾你和你的孩子的。”王后在小屋里住了七年，受到了很好的照顾，由于她笃信上帝，双手也因上帝的恩典重新长了出来。","But the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to be shed, and had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue and eyes, and kept them.Then said she to the Queen, “I cannot have thee killed as the King commands, but here thou mayst stay no longer.Go forth into the wide world with thy child, and never come here again.”The poor woman tied her child on her back, and went away with eyes full of tears.She came into a great wild forest, and then she fell on her knees and prayed to God, and the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a little house on which was a sign with the words, “Here all dwell free.”A snow-white maiden came out of the little house and said, ‘Welcome, Lady Queen,” and conducted her inside.Then they unbound the little boy from her back, and held him to her breast that he might feed, and laid him in a beautifully-made little bed.Then said the poor woman, “From whence knowest thou that I was a queen?”The white maiden answered, “I am an angel sent by God, to watch over thee and thy child.”The Queen stayed seven years in the little house, and was well cared for, and by God’s grace, because of her piety, her hands which had been cut off, grew once more."
"最终，国王打完仗回来了，他的第一个心愿就是看一看自己的妻子和孩子。老母亲忍不住痛哭起来，说道：“你这个邪恶的人，你为什么写信让我杀了这两个无辜的人啊？”她把那两封魔鬼伪造的信拿给国王看，接着说：“我按你的吩咐做了。”接着，她把物证——王后的舌头和眼睛交给了国王。国王为他可怜的妻子和孩子而大哭起来，比老母亲哭得还要伤心，老母亲可怜他，便说道：“放心吧，她还活着呢；我偷偷地让人杀了一头雌鹿，这些物证就是从鹿身上取来的；但我把孩子绑在你妻子的背上，让他们离开了，还让她保证永远不再回来，因为你那时那么生她的气。”接着，国王说：“只要他们没有被杀，没有被饿死，我宁愿不吃不喝地走到天边，直到我找到我亲爱的妻子和孩子。”","At last the King came home again from the war, and his first wish was to see his wife and the child.Then his aged mother began to weep and said, “Thou wicked man, why didst thou write to me that I was to take those two innocent lives?” and she showed him the two letters which the Evil-one had forged, and then continued, “I did as thou badest me,” and she showed the tokens, the tongue and eyes.Then the King began to weep for his poor wife and his little son so much more bitterly than she was doing, that the aged mother had compassion on him and said, “Be at peace, she still lives; I secretly caused a hind to be killed, and took these tokens from it; but I bound the child to thy wife’s back and bade her go forth into the wide world, and made her promise never to come back here again, because thou wert so angry with her.”Then spoke the King, “I will go as far as the sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have found again my dear wife and my child, if in the meantime they have not been killed, or died of hunger.”"
"于是，国王一直四处寻找了七年，他找遍了岩石的每一处裂缝，也找遍了每一个山洞，却一无所获，国王心想她也许已经饿死了。这七年时间里，他不吃不喝，然而上帝让他撑了下来。最终，他走进了一片大森林里，发现那里有一间带有“每个人都可免费居住”标牌的小屋。白衣少女走了出来，握住他的手，带他走进了屋里，天使说道：“欢迎你，国王陛下。”她还询问国王从哪里来。国王答道：“我七年来四处寻找我的妻子和孩子，可找不到他们。”天使给他准备了食物和水，可国王什么也不要，只想稍微休息一下。于是他便躺下睡着了，在脸上蒙了一块手帕。","Thereupon the King travelled about for seven long years, and sought her in every cleft of the rocks and in every cave, but he found her not, and thought she had died of want.During the whole of this time he neither ate nor drank, but God supported him.At length he came into a great forest, and found therein the little house whose sign was, “Here all dwell free.”Then forth came the white maiden, took him by the hand, led him in, and said, “Welcome, Lord King,” and asked him from whence he came.He answered, “Soon shall I have travelled about for the space of seven years, and I seek my wife and her child, but cannot find them.”The angel offered him meat and drink, but he did not take anything, and only wished to rest a little.Then he lay down to sleep, and put a handkerchief over his face."
"天使走进王后和孩子所在的房间里，这个孩子经常被母亲叫做“可悲”。天使对王后说：“带着孩子出去吧，你的丈夫来了。”于是，她来到国王躺着的地方，发现手帕从他脸上滑落下来。王后说：“可悲，为你父亲捡起手帕，再盖到他的脸上。”孩子捡起手帕，又盖到父亲脸上。国王在睡梦中听到了一些，便故意又让手帕滑落下去。可孩子不耐烦了，他说：“亲爱的妈妈，我没有父亲，又怎么能给父亲盖上手帕呢？我总是祈祷说：‘我们的天父。’你曾经告诉过我，我的父亲在天堂，就是那善良的上帝，我怎么能叫这个野人父亲呢？他不是我的父亲。”国王听到这些话后，便坐起身来，询问他们是什么人。她说：“我是你的妻子啊，这是你的儿子，他叫可悲。”国王看到她灵活的双手，说道：“我妻子的双手是银制的。”王后回答说：“仁慈的上帝让我重新长出了双手。”天使到里面的房间里拿出了银制的双手，给国王看。于是，国王确信，这真的是他亲爱的妻子和儿子，他十分高兴地亲吻他们，说：“我心里的一块大石头终于落地了。”天使和他们一起吃了饭，之后，他们就返回王宫，回到了国王的老母亲身边。王宫里充满着欢乐，国王和王后又重新举行了婚礼，幸福美满地过完了一生。","Thereupon the angel went into the chamber where the Queen sat with her son, whom she usually called “Sorrowful,” and said to her, “Go out with thy child, thy husband hath come.”So she went to the place where he lay, and the handkerchief fell from his face.Then said she, “Sorrowful, pick up thy father’s handkerchief, and cover his face again.”The child picked it up, and put it over his face again.The King in his sleep heard what passed, and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief fall once more.But the child grew impatient, and said, “Dear mother, how can I cover my father’s face when I have no father in this world?I have learnt to say the prayer, ‘Our Father, which art in Heaven,’ thou hast told me that my father was in Heaven, and was the good God, and how can I know a wild man like this?He is not my father.”When the King heard that, he got up, and asked who they were.Then said she, “I am thy wife, and that is thy son, Sorrowful.”And he saw her living hands, and said, “My wife had silver hands.”She answered, “The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again;” and the angel went into the inner room, and brought the silver hands, and showed them to him.Hereupon he knew for a certainty that it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed them, and was glad, and said, “A heavy stone has fallen from off mine heart.”Then the angel of God gave them one meal with her, and after that they went home to the King’s aged mother.There were great rejoicings everywhere, and the King and Queen were married again, and lived contentedly to their happy end."
"玻璃棺材","The Glass Coffin"
"永远不要说穷裁缝成不了大事、得不到很高的荣誉；只要他进对铺子一样能成功，最重要的是，他必须要有好运气。有一回，一个谦恭有礼、聪明机敏的裁缝学徒外出旅行，行至一片大森林，因不知去路，迷失了方向。夜幕降临，他什么也做不了，只能在一片清冷孤寂中寻个睡处。苔草柔软自是良好的眠床，可是对野兽的恐惧令他无法在草上休息，最后他不得不下决心在树上度过这一晚。他找了一棵高高的橡树，爬到树顶，谢天谢地他还带着他的弯柄熨斗，不然吹过树顶的大风定要把他刮走。","Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things and win high honors; all that is needed is that he should go to the right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he should have good luck.A civil, adroit tailor’s apprentice once went out travelling, and came into a great forest, and, as he did not know the way, he lost himself.Night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude.He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree.He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it, and thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away."
"在黑暗中呆了几个小时，他既是害怕、又是发抖，却见有亮光闪烁近在咫尺，他心想也许有人住在那里，借宿在那里一定比呆在树枝上舒服，就小心翼翼地下来，朝亮光处走去。亮光指引他来到一个用芦苇和灯心草结成的小茅屋前。他大胆地敲门，门开了，借着亮光他看到一个花白头发的小老头，穿着由五颜六色小布片缝成的外套。“你是谁，你想要什么？”老头咕哝了一声。“我是个穷裁缝，”他回答，“因为天黑在这荒郊野外迷了路，我诚心请求您让我在您的茅屋里呆到天亮。”“走开。”老人粗声粗气地回答道，“我不招待流浪汉，到别处找地方去。”他说罢这几句话就要再回茅屋里去时，但裁缝紧紧地抓住他外套的衣角，祈求得甚是哀婉，这老头本也不是他想表现出来的那般凶恶，最终心软下来，带他进了茅屋，给他些吃的，让他睡在角落里一张十分舒适的床上。","After he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light.It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes.He knocked boldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw a little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored stuff sewn together.“Who are you, and what do you want?” asked the man in a grumbling voice.“I am a poor tailor,” he answered, “whom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning.”“Go your way,” replied the old man in a surly voice, “I will have nothing to do with runagates; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere.”After these words he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then pointed out to him a very good bed in a corner."
"疲惫的裁缝不需要摇篮，香香甜甜一觉睡到早上，若不是一声巨响，他都没想到要起来。一阵尖叫和咆哮的喧闹声穿过茅屋那薄薄的墙壁。裁缝呢，倒是出乎意料地勇敢，一跃而起，匆匆穿上衣服，急忙跑了出去。就在茅屋近处，他看到一头庞大的黑色公牛和一头漂亮的雄鹿正准备着打一场恶战。他们朝对方冲过去，怒不可遏，连大地都被它们踏得摇撼起来，空中回荡着他们的怒吼。过了许久，都不能确定它们之中谁获胜了；最后雄鹿用它的角刺进对手的身体，公牛发出一声恐怖的嚎叫，瘫倒在地，雄鹿又刺了几下，公牛彻底死了。","The weary tailor needed no rocking; but slept sweetly till morning, but even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had not been aroused by a great noise.A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut.The tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes on in haste, and hurried out.Then close by the hut, he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just preparing for a violent struggle.They rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling, and the air resounded with their cries.For a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory; at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary’s body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was thoroughly despatched by a few strokes from the stag."
"裁缝看到这场战斗惊愕不已，正呆立着一动不动，那雄鹿却跳将起来向他猛冲，裁缝还来不及逃走，就被鹿的大角挑了起来。他没多少时间整理思绪，因为雄鹿飞快地掠过畜群，跳过石堆，翻高山越溪谷，穿树林过草地。他双手抓住鹿的角尖，听天由命。他觉得自己简直就像在飞一样。最后，雄鹿在一堵石墙前停了下来，轻轻地放裁缝下来。裁缝已经半死不活了，过了很长一段时间才缓过神来。当裁缝稍稍恢复过来的时候，一直站在他旁边的雄鹿用它的鹿角使劲推石头里的一扇门，门猛地打开了。火舌灼灼，喷涌而出，接着是一大团浓烟，雄鹿便隐于其中，消失在裁缝的视线里。裁缝不知道该做些什么，也不知道该向哪边转，才能从这荒漠中逃脱，再次回到人世间。正当他站在那里一点头绪都没有的时候，一个声音从石头里传出来，向他喊道：“无畏地进来吧，没有邪恶的力量会加害于你。”他犹豫未决，却由一股神秘的力量驱使，听从那个声音，穿过铁门进入一间宽敞的大厅，大厅的天花板、墙壁还有地板都是由抛光的方形石头做成，闪闪发亮，每块石头上面都刻着他不懂的字母。他满是钦羡地欣赏着每一样东西，正要走出去，又听到那声音对他说：“站到大厅中央的石头上去，一大笔宝藏在等待着你。”","The tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns.He had not much time to collect his thoughts, for it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and valley, wood and meadow.He held with both hands to the tops of the horns, and resigned himself to his fate.It seemed, however, to him just as if he were flying away.At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor down.The tailor, more dead than alive, required a longer time than that to come to himself.When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door which was in the rock, that it sprang open.Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight.The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again.Whilst he was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock, which cried to him, “Enter without fear, no evil shall befall you thee.”He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were cut letters which were unknown to him.He looked at everything full of admiration, and was on the point of going out again, when he once more heard the voice which said to him, “Step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune awaits thee.”"
"他已经勇气倍增，便服从了指令。他脚下的石头降了下去，慢慢陷入地底深处。等到一切重新稳固后，裁缝四下看看，他发现自己在一个大小和先前差不多的大厅里。不过，这里却有更多的东西供他欣赏、让他艳羡。墙壁被挖出一个个洞，洞里摆着透明玻璃花瓶，里面装着五颜六色的美酒和氤氲发蓝的蒸汽。大厅的地板上两个大玻璃箱子相对而立，立刻激起了他的好奇心。他走向其中一个，看到里面装着一个漂亮的模型，像是一座城堡，周围环绕着农舍、马厩和谷仓，还有其他许许多多好东西。每一件东西都很小，但是却做得极其精巧细致，好像是由一双灵巧的手雕刻而成，做得极为精巧。","His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order.The stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down into the depths.When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked round, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former.Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire.Hollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of transparent glass which were filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapour.On the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity.When he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure like a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns, and a quantity of other good things.Everything was small, but exceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be cut out by a dexterous hand with the greatest exactitude."
"若是没有再次听到那声音，他的眼睛可能久久不会从这些稀罕物上移开。那声音叫他转过身来去看放在另一边的玻璃箱子。他看到箱子里躺着一个美丽无比的少女，更增添几分歆羡赞慕之情。她像是睡着了一般地躺着，长而美丽的秀发像一件珍贵的斗篷似的裹在身上。她双目紧闭，可是她那泛着光彩的肌肤以及随着呼吸一起一伏的丝带毫无疑问地表明她是活着的。裁缝看着美丽的少女，心脏怦怦直跳，她却突然睁开眼睛，见到他便突然跳起，又惊又喜。“万能的上帝！”她叫道，“我脱离苦海的日子到啦！快，快，帮我离开我的牢笼；若是你把这玻璃棺材的插销拔出来，我就能自由啦。”裁缝立即照做，她马上就抬起玻璃盖出来，急急忙忙跑到大厅的角落，披上一件大披风。然后她坐在一块石头上，命令年轻人来到自己身边来，在年轻人的唇上印了友好的一吻，说道：“我期盼已久的拯救者啊，是仁慈的上帝指引你来到我这里，并且结束我的不幸。我的苦难结束之日，即你的幸福开始之时。你是上帝为我挑选的夫君，你将会快乐地度过此生，我会爱你不渝，你还会拥有人世间所有财富珍宝。你坐好，来听听我的故事：","He might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration of this rarity for some time, if the voice had not once more made itself heard.It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite.How his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty!She lay as if asleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a precious mantle.Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to and fro, left no doubt that she was alive.The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror.“Just Heaven!” cried she, “my deliverance is at hand!Quick, quick, help me out of my prison; if thou pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.”The tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up the glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall, where she covered herself with a large cloak.Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, “My long-desired deliverer, kind Heaven has guided thee to me, and put an end to my sorrows.On the self-same day when they end, shall thy happiness begin.Thou art the husband chosen for me by Heaven, and shalt pass thy life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession.Seat thyself, and listen to the story of my life:"
"“我是一名富有的伯爵的女儿。我父母在我年纪还很小的时候便死了，在他们的遗嘱里将我托付给我的哥哥，我便由我哥哥带大。我们彼此相亲相爱，无论是想法还是喜好，我们俩都极其相似，于是我们便相互约定永不嫁娶，彼此相伴一生。我们的房子永远不会寂寞，邻里、朋友常来探望，我们对每个人都热情款待。直到有一天，一个陌生人骑马来到我们的城堡，借口无法继续赶路，请求在我们这里借宿一晚。我们非常有礼貌地答应了他的请求，晚餐间他谈笑风生，说了许多故事，令我们非常愉快。我哥哥非常喜欢这个陌生人，就请求他和我们共住几日，他迟疑了一下后，同意了。我们在桌边坐到夜深了方才散去，把陌生人送去他的房间，我因疲惫也赶快躺在了我柔软的床上。我刚睡着没多久，就被一阵微弱而愉悦的音乐声叫醒了。我不知道这声音是从什么地方飘进来的，便想唤醒睡在隔壁房的女仆，可是我却惊异地发现自己的声音被一种未知的力量夺走了。我感到胸口像压了一座大山似的，一刻重似一刻地往下沉，连极小的声音都发不了。这时，由夜灯的光照着，我看到陌生人经由两扇门闩紧紧插好的门进了我的房间。他走到我面前说，他施了魔法，让那动人的音乐把我唤醒，现在他硬是冲破所有封锁，只想把他的身心交付于我。然而我对他的魔法极为反感，没有给他任何答复。他一动不动地站了一会儿，显然是想等待一个合他心意的决定，不过我一直保持沉默，他便愤怒地宣称他要为自己复仇，要找个法子来惩罚我的骄傲，说罢离开了房间。我忐忑不安了一个晚上，快到早晨的时候才睡去。我一醒来就匆匆去找我哥哥，但他不在自己的房间里，随从告诉我，他黎明时分就同陌生人一起去打猎了。","“I am the daughter of a rich count.My parents died when I was still in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will to my elder brother, by whom I was brought up.We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives.In our house there was no lack of company; neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one.So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night.We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories.My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented.We did not rise from table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in my soft bed.Hardly had I slept for a short time, when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me.As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force.I felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make the very slightest sound.In the meantime, by the light of my night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted.He came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart.My repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that I vouchsafed him no answer.He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room.I passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and only fell asleep towards morning.When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase by daybreak."
"“我马上觉得不会是好事。我便迅速穿好衣服，又下令将我的驯马套好马鞍，只由一名仆人陪同，策马飞驰进了森林。仆人连人带马摔了一跤，马儿的蹄子摔断了，不能再跟随我。我只好马不停蹄地赶路，没几分钟的时间就看见那个陌生人向我走来，手里用绳子牵了一头漂亮的雄鹿。我问他把哥哥丢在哪儿了，他又是怎么会牵头鹿来的，我看到鹿的大眼睛里留出了泪水。陌生人不回答，却放声大笑起来。见他这样我盛怒不止，便掏出手枪朝这禽兽开枪，可是子弹却从他胸膛上弹了回来，打进了我那匹马的头部。我倒在地上，那陌生人口中念念有词，我便失去了意识。","“I at once suspected nothing good.I dressed myself quickly, ordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one servant, rode full gallop to the forest.The servant fell with his horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its foot.I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes I saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which he led by a cord.I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing.Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly.I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse’s head.I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness."
"“当我再度恢复神智的时候，就发现自己在这个地下洞穴里，躺在玻璃棺材中。魔法师再次出现的时候，他告诉我说他已经把我哥哥变作雄鹿，把我的城堡和里面所有的器物都用魔法缩小，关在另一个玻璃箱子里，而我的家人，都已化作烟雾被囚禁在玻璃瓶里。他告诉我只要我顺从他的心愿，把所有东西变回原样简直是小事一桩，只要打开那些器皿，所有东西就会变回原来的样子。我像第一次一样对他只字未吐。他消失了，把我关在囚笼里，我也在那里沉沉睡去。在我梦里所有的情景中，最为欣慰的便是一个年轻人过来将我放出来，我今天睁开眼睛看到了你，亲眼见到我的梦境成真了。帮我一一实现发生在梦里其他的事情吧。第一件便是把装着城堡的玻璃箱子搬起来，放到那块大石头上去。”","“When I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin.The magician appeared once again, and said he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all that belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had shut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all turned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles.He told me that if I would now comply with his wish, it was an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as he had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would return once more to its natural form.I answered him as little as I had done the first time.He vanished and left me in my prison, in which a deep sleep came on me.Amongst the visions which passed before my eyes, that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw thee, and beheld my dream fulfilled.Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions.The first is that we lift the glass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone.”"
"石头刚一承重，就开始带着少女和年轻人高高升起，从天花板开口处一直升到上面的大厅，他们从那儿到户外很是容易。少女便在这里打开盖子，神奇的事情发生了，装在里面的城堡、屋宇、农舍都以最快的速度伸展扩大，变回它们实际的大小。然后，少女和裁缝又回到地下的洞穴，拿着装着烟雾的器皿，让石头给带上去。少女刚刚打开瓶子，蓝烟就一涌而出，变成一个个大活人，她一一认出了她的仆人和家人。当她看到变回人形的哥哥从森林里走出来，已经杀死了化作公牛的魔法师，更是欣喜万分。就在这一天，少女遵守她的承诺，在圣坛前与幸运的裁缝牵手交托终身。","As soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air.Here the maiden opened the lid, and it was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and the farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity.After this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone.The maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people.Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor."
"林间小屋","The Hut in the Forest"
"在荒凉的森林边上有一间小屋，住着一个贫穷的打柴人和他的妻子，还有三个女儿。一天早上，他正要去打柴的时候，对妻子说：“让大女儿把午饭给我送到林子里去吧，不然我会饿得干不完活了。为了不让她迷路，”他又补充道，“我会随身带一袋小米，在路上撒些米粒。”因此，当太阳爬到了林子中央的上空时，大女儿便带着一锅汤出发了。可田野和林子里的鸟儿，像麻雀啊、云雀啊、燕雀啊，还有山鸟等等，早就把那些小米啄食光了，于是女孩找不到路。因此她便想要碰碰运气，于是便继续赶路，可一直走到了太阳落山，夜幕降临。树木在漆黑的夜里沙沙作响，猫头鹰也低叫着，女孩感到害怕了。这时，她看到远处有一点灯光在树丛之间摇曳着。她心想：“那里应该是住着人家的，或许能让我进去过一夜吧。”于是便朝灯光的方向走去。不一会儿，她就来到了一间屋子前，小屋的窗户都被灯光映亮了。她敲敲门，里面传出了粗鲁的喊声：“进来。”女孩便走进黑漆漆的前厅，又敲了敲房间的门。那个声音喊道：“进来吧。”当她打开门时，看到一个头发灰白的老头坐在桌旁，他双手托腮，白胡子拖过桌子，几乎快着地了。有三只动物正趴在火炉旁边，一只母鸡，一只公鸡，还有一头花斑奶牛。女孩向老头讲述了她的遭遇，恳请他能让自己借宿一夜。老头说：","A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the edge of a lonely forest.One morning as he was about to go to his work, he said to his wife, “Let my dinner be brought into the forest to me by my eldest daughter, or I shall never get my work done, and in order that she may not miss her way,” he added, “I will take a bag of millet with me and strew the seeds on the path.”When, therefore, the sun was just above the center of the forest, the girl set out on her way with a bowl of soup, but the field-sparrows, and wood-sparrows, larks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked up the millet long before, and the girl could not find the track.Then trusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and night began to fall.The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and she began to be afraid.Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the trees.“There ought to be some people living there, who can take me in for the night,” thought she, and went up to the light.It was not long before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up.She knocked, and a rough voice from inside cried, “Come in.”The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of the room.“Just come in,” cried the voice, and when she opened the door, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the table, supporting his face with both hands, and his white beard fell down over the table almost as far as the ground.By the stove lay three animals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow.The girl told her story to the old man, and begged for shelter for the night.The man said,"
"“漂亮的小母鸡，漂亮的小公鸡，还有漂亮的花奶牛，你们觉得怎样呢？”","“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And pretty brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"动物们答道：“嘟嘟嘟。”那意思一定是说：“我们愿意。”因为老头随即说：“你可以留在这里用餐过夜了，去点上火，给我们准备点晚餐吧。”女孩看到厨房里真是应有尽有啊，她做了一顿丰盛的晚餐，却没有考虑到给小动物们做些吃的。她把盛满饭菜的碗碟都端到了桌子上，挨着白发老头坐下来，饱餐了一顿。酒足饭饱后，她说道：“我现在好累啊，哪里有床能让我躺下来睡一觉呢？”动物们回答道：","“Duks,” answered the animals, and that must have meant, “We are willing,” for the old man said, “Here you shall have shelter and food, go to the fire, and cook us our supper.”The girl found in the kitchen abundance of everything, and cooked a good supper, but had no thought of the animals.She carried the full dishes to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man, ate and satisfied her hunger.When she had had enough, she said, “But now I am tired, where is there a bed in which I can lie down, and sleep?”The animals replied,"
"“你和他一起吃饱了，你和他一起喝足了，却根本没有考虑过我们，所以你自己找地方过夜去吧。”","“Thou hast eaten with him, Thou hast drunk with him, Thou hast had no thought for us, So find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night.”"
"这时，老头说道：“到楼上去吧，那里有间房，里面摆着两张床，你把床整理一下，铺上白色亚麻床单，我过一会儿也要过去休息的。”女孩上楼了，她打扫好两张床，铺上干净的床单后，并没有等老头上楼来就躺下了。过了一会儿，白发老头上楼了，他拿着蜡烛看看女孩，然后摇了摇头。他看女孩睡熟了，便打开地板上的一扇暗门，把女孩放进了地窖里。","Then said the old man, “Just go upstairs, and thou wilt find a room with two beds, shake them up, and put white linen on them, and then I, too, will come and lie down to sleep.”The girl went up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets on, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for the old man.After some time, however, the gray-haired man came, took his candle, looked at the girl and shook his head.When he saw that she had fallen into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her down into the cellar."
"打柴人很晚才回到家，他埋怨妻子让他饿了一整天。妻子答道：“不是我的错啊，大女儿带着饭去了呀，她一定是迷路了，但她明天会回来的。”打柴人第二天天不亮就起床了，他去林子前嘱咐二女儿去给他送饭。他说：“我随身带一袋扁豆，扁豆粒比小米粒大，女儿也会看得更清楚，就不会迷路了。”因此，到了吃饭时间，女孩带着食物上路了，可扁豆不见了。原来，林子里的鸟儿又像先前那样把扁豆也啄食光了，一粒都不剩。女孩在林子里四处徘徊，一直到了晚上，然后她也来到了老头家，老头让她进屋，她恳求老头给她些食物，并能留宿一晚。白胡子老头又询问那些动物们：","Late at night the wood-cutter came home, and reproached his wife for leaving him to hunger all day.“It is not my fault,” she replied, “the girl went out with your dinner, and must have lost herself, but she is sure to come back tomorrow.”The wood-cutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the forest, and requested that the second daughter should take him his dinner that day.“I will take a bag with lentils,” said he; “the seeds are larger than millet, the girl will see them better, and can’t lose her way.”At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took out the food, but the lentils had disappeared.The birds of the forest had picked them up as they had done the day before, and had left none.The girl wandered about in the forest until night, and then she too reached the house of the old man, was told to go in, and begged for food and a bed.The man with the white beard again asked the animals,"
"“漂亮的小母鸡，漂亮的小公鸡，还有漂亮的花奶牛，你们觉得怎样呢？”","“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And pretty brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"动物们又回答道：“嘟嘟嘟。”所有事情都和昨天发生的一样。女孩做了一顿丰盛的晚餐，和老头吃饱喝足了，却也忘记了考虑动物们。当她询问休息的地方时，动物们回答道：","The animals again replied “Duks,” and everything happened just as it had happened the day before.The girl cooked a good meal, ate and drank with the old man, and did not concern herself about the animals, and when she inquired about her bed they answered,"
"“你和他一起吃饱了，你和他一起喝足了，却没有为我们考虑，那就自己去找过夜的地方吧。”","“Thou hast eaten with him, Thou hast drunk with him, Thou hast had no thought for us, To find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night.”"
"老头上楼时，女孩已经睡熟了。他看看她，摇了摇头，也把她放到了地窖里。","When she was asleep the old man came, looked at her, shook his head, and let her down into the cellar."
"第三天早晨，打柴人对妻子说：“今天让小女儿去给我送饭吧，她一直都是又善良又温顺，会找对路的，不会像她姐姐们那样追着野蜂四处乱跑。”妻子却不同意了，她说：“我难道还要失去最疼爱的小女儿吗？”","On the third morning the wood-cutter said to his wife, “Send our youngest child out with my dinner today, she has always been good and obedient, and will stay in the right path, and not run about after every wild humble-bee, as her sisters did.”The mother did not want to do it, and said, “Am I to lose my dearest child, as well?”"
"他答道：“别怕，小女儿不会迷路的，她谨慎又聪明；另外我也会带上一些豌豆把它们撒在路上。豌豆比扁豆还要大呢，能给她带路的。”可是，当女孩挎着篮子出去的时候，林子里的鸽子早已把豌豆吃掉了，她也找不到该走哪条路了。她满心悲伤，不停地想父亲该有多饥饿啊，要是自己回不去家的话，她善良的母亲又会有多伤心啊。最后，天色暗下来，她看到了一丝灯光，便也来到了那间林间小屋跟前。她很有礼貌地请求老头允许她在那里过一夜，白胡子老头再一次询问了他的动物们：","“Have no fear,’ he replied, “the girl will not go astray; she is too prudent and sensible; besides I will take some peas with me, and strew them about.They are still larger than lentils, and will show her the way.”But when the girl went out with her basket on her arm, the wood-pigeons had already got all the peas in their crops, and she did not know which way she was to turn.She was full of sorrow and never ceased to think how hungry her father would be, and how her good mother would grieve, if she did not go home.At length when it grew dark, she saw the light and came to the house in the forest.She begged quite prettily to be allowed to spend the night there, and the man with the white beard once more asked his animals,"
"“漂亮的小母鸡，漂亮的小公鸡，还有漂亮的花奶牛，你们觉得怎样呢？”","“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And beautiful brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"它们答道：“嘟嘟嘟。”于是女孩走到火炉旁，动物们都躺在那里，她用手轻轻抚摸着公鸡和母鸡光滑的羽毛，还抚摸花奶牛两角之间的地方。她按老头的吩咐准备了美味的晚餐，当把碗端到桌上后，她说道：“我怎么能自己尽情享用晚餐，却看着这些乖巧的动物们挨饿呢？外面有很多吃的呢，我先去照顾一下它们吧。”于是她拿了一些大麦，撒给公鸡和母鸡，又抱了一大束散发着清香味的干草给花奶牛享用。她说：“可爱的动物们，希望你们会喜欢，要是你们口渴了，还有新鲜的水喝。”于是，她又提来一桶水，小公鸡和小母鸡便跳到了桶沿上，把嘴伸进桶里喝起来，然后像小鸟喝水时一样昂起头来。花奶牛也痛痛快快地畅饮了一番。喂好动物后，女孩便靠着老头在桌旁坐下了，吃了一些老头剩下的饭菜。不久后，小公鸡和小母鸡就泛起了睡意，他们把头伸到了翅膀下，花奶牛也一样有些睁不开眼了。于是女孩问：“我们是不是该睡觉了呢？”","“Duks,” said they.Then the girl went to the stove where the animals were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked their smooth feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled cow between her horns, and when, in obedience to the old man’s orders, she had made ready some good soup, and the bowl was placed upon the table, she said, “Am I to eat as much as I want, and the good animals to have nothing?Outside is food in plenty, I will look after them first.”So she went and brought some barley and stewed it for the cock and hen, and a whole armful of sweet—smelling hay for the cow.“I hope you will like it, dear animals,” said she, “and you shall have a refreshing draught in case you are thirsty.”Then she fetched in a bucketful of water, and the cock and hen jumped on to the edge of it and dipped their beaks in, and then held up their heads as the birds do when they drink, and the brindled cow also took a hearty draught.When the animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by the old man, and ate what he had left.It was not long before the cock and the hen began to thrust their heads beneath their wings, and the eyes of the cow likewise began to blink.Then said the girl, “Ought we not to go to bed?”"
"“漂亮的小母鸡，漂亮的小公鸡，还有漂亮的花奶牛，你们觉得呢？”","“Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And pretty brindled cow, What say ye to that?”"
"动物们答道：“嘟嘟嘟。”","The animals answered “Duks,”"
"“你和我们一起吃饭，也和我们一起喝水，你为我们考虑得很周到，我们祝你晚安。”","“Thou hast eaten with us, Thou hast drunk with us, Thou hast had kind thought for all of us, We wish thee good-night.”"
"于是女孩上楼去了，她打扫了两张床，都铺上了干净的床单。她做完这些时，老头上来了躺到一张床上，他的白胡子长得都到脚跟了。女孩躺到另一张床上，做过祷告之后便入睡了。","Then the maiden went upstairs, shook the feather-beds, and laid clean sheets on them, and when she had done it the old man came and lay down on one of the beds, and his white beard reached down to his feet.The girl lay down on the other, said her prayers, and fell asleep."
"她一直安睡到午夜，忽然被小屋里的一阵噪声吵醒了。屋子四处传来噼里啪啦的响声，房门都被弹开了，又打到了墙上。屋梁也发出了仿佛被撕扯而断裂的声音，楼梯好像也塌了下来，最后传来一声巨响，就像整个房顶都塌陷了一样。然而，一切最终又都安静下来了，女孩安然无恙。她仍旧安静地躺在原来的地方，又渐渐睡着了。可是早上她在明媚的阳光照耀下醒来时，呈现在眼前的是什么景象啊？她正躺在一间宽敞的大厅里，周围的所有东西都闪耀着金色的光芒；墙壁上也挂着由绿色缎面衬托着的金色花朵，象牙白颜色的床上是红色的天鹅绒顶篷，靠床的椅子上还摆放着一双缀有珍珠的鞋子。女孩以为自己是在做梦呢，可是却进来了三个衣着华丽的侍者，他们问女孩有没有什么吩咐。她答道：“你们出去吧，我要马上起床，给老人家准备早餐，再去喂一喂那漂亮的小母鸡、小公鸡和漂亮的花奶牛。”她心想老头已经起床了，转过头去看了看他的床；可床上躺着的不是老头，而是一个陌生人。她盯着那个人看，发觉他既年轻又英俊。他醒了，坐在床上，说道：“我是一个王子，曾被可恶的巫婆施了魔法；她把我变成了一个花白头发的老头囚禁在森林里；谁也不能靠近我，除了我的三个侍从，她们被变成了小公鸡、小母鸡和花奶牛。只有一个不仅对人充满爱心、也一样善待动物的女孩来到我们身边的时候，咒语才能被解除——你就是这样一个女孩，因为你，我们在午夜重获自由了，森林里的这间小屋也变回了我的宫殿。”他们都起床后，王子便命令他的三个侍从去把女孩的父母接来，参加他们的婚礼盛宴。女孩问道：“可是，我的两个姐姐在哪里呢？”“我把她们锁在了地窖里，明天她们就会被带到森林去，给一个烧炭工当仆人，直到她们变得善良了，不会再让可怜的动物们忍饥挨饿，才算完事。”","She slept quietly till midnight, and then there was such a noise in the house that she awoke.There was a sound of cracking and splitting in every corner, and the doors sprang open, and beat against the walls.The beams groaned as if they were being torn out of their joints, it seemed as if the staircase were falling down, and at length there was a crash as if the entire roof had fallen in.As, however, all grew quiet once more, and the girl was not hurt, she stayed quietly lying where she was, and fell asleep again.But when she woke up in the morning with the brilliancy of the sunshine, what did her eyes behold?She was lying in a vast hall, and everything around her shone with royal splendor; on the walls, golden flowers grew up on a ground of green silk, the bed was of ivory, and the canopy of red velvet, and on a chair close by, was a pair of shoes embroidered with pearls.The girl believed that she was in a dream, but three richly clad attendants came in, and asked what orders she would like to give.“If you will go,” she replied, “I will get up at once and make ready some soup for the old man, and then I will feed the pretty little hen, and the cock, and the beautiful brindled cow.”She thought the old man was up already, and looked round at his bed; he, however, was not lying in it, but a stranger.And while she was looking at him, and becoming aware that he was young and handsome, he awoke, sat up in bed, and said, “I am a King’s son, and was bewitched by a wicked witch, and made to live in this forest, as an old gray-haired man; no one was allowed to be with me but my three attendants in the form of a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow.The spell was not to be broken until a girl came to us whose heart was so good that she showed herself full of love, not only towards mankind, but towards animals—and that thou hast done, and by thee at midnight we were set free, and the old hut in the forest was changed back again into my royal palace.”And when they had arisen, the King’s son ordered the three attendants to set out and fetch the father and mother of the girl to the marriage feast.“But where are my two sisters?” inquired the maiden.“I have locked them in the cellar, and tomorrow they shall be led into the forest, and shall live as servants to a charcoal-burner, until they have grown kinder, and do not leave poor animals to suffer hunger.”"
"大铁炉","The Iron Stove"
"在愿望还能成为现实的岁月里，有一位王子，被一个老女巫施了魔法，关在森林中的一个铁炉里。他在那里生活了很多年，没有人能救他。后来，有一位公主来到森林里，她迷路了，无法回到她父亲的王国。她四处徘徊了九天，最后来到这个铁炉前。这时，铁炉里传出了声音，问她：“你从哪里来，要到哪里去？”她答道：“我找不到父亲的王国，回不了家了。”铁炉里的声音又说道：“如果你答应我一件事，我就帮你回家，你很快就能回到家。我是另一位国王的儿子，他比你父亲还高贵，你要嫁给我。”","In the days when wishing was still of some use, a King’s son was bewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest.There he passed many years, and no one could deliver him.Then a King’s daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could not find her father’s kingdom again.After she had wandered about for nine days, she at length came to the iron stove.Then a voice came forth from it, and asked her, “Whence comest thou, and whither goest, thou?”She answered, “I have lost my father’s kingdom, and cannot get home again.”Then a voice inside the iron stove said, “I will help thee to get home again, and that indeed most swiftly, if thou wilt promise to do what I desire of thee.I am the son of a far greater King than thy father, and I will marry thee.”"
"公主听后很害怕，心想：“仁慈的上帝啊！我要这个铁炉干什么啊？”可是她太想回到父亲身边了，便答应了他的要求。他说：“你要带着一把刀子回到这里来，并在铁炉上刮出一个洞。”于是，他给她找来一位同伴。那人走到公主跟前，却一言不发，不到两个小时他就将公主带回了家。公主回宫后，整个王宫都充满了欢乐的气氛。老国王搂住女儿，亲吻着她。可公主却十分烦恼，她说道：“亲爱的父亲，我吃了很多苦！要是我没遇到那个个铁炉，我就只能呆在大森林里，永远也回不来了。可是我被迫向他承诺，我要回去救他，还要和他成亲。”老国王听后很害怕，他差一点就晕倒了，他只有这一个女儿啊。于是他们决定，把磨坊主的女儿送到森林里去，她长得也很漂亮，让她代替公主。他们把磨坊主的女儿带到森林里，给了她一把刀子，并告诉她要在铁炉上刮出一个洞。磨坊主的女儿刮了一天一夜，可是一点东西也没有刮下来。天亮后，炉子里有个声音说道：“我觉得外面好像天亮了。”磨坊主的女儿回答说：“我觉得也是。我好像听到父亲磨坊里的声音了。”","Then was she afraid, and thought, “Good heavens!What can I do with an iron stove?”But as she much wished to get home to her father, she promised to do as he desired.But he said, “Thou shalt return here, and bring a knife with thee, and scrape a hole in the iron.”Then he gave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, but in two hours he took her home; there was great joy in the castle when the King’s daughter came home, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her.She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, “Dear father, what I have suffered!I should never have got home again from the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I have been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it free, and marry it.”Then the old King was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he had but this one daughter.They therefore resolved they would send, in her place, the miller’s daughter, who was very beautiful.They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the iron stove.So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but could not bring off the least morsel of it.When day dawned, a voice in the stove said, “It seems to me it is day outside.”Then she answered, “It seems so to me too; I fancy I hear the noise of my father’s mill.”"
"“这么说你是个磨坊主的女儿！你马上回去，让公主到这里来。”磨坊主的女儿立即离开了。她告诉老国王，铁炉里的那个人不喜欢她，他叫公主过去。然而，还有一个养猪人的女儿，她比磨坊主的女儿还漂亮。他们决定给她一枚金币，让她代替公主到铁炉那里去。养猪人的女儿被带到铁炉旁，她也用刀子刮了一天一夜。可她什么也没有刮掉。天亮后，炉子里有个声音说道：“我觉得外面好像天亮了！”养猪人的女儿答道：“我觉得也是。我好像听到父亲吹响放猪号的声音了。”","“So thou art a miller’s daughter!Then go thy way at once, and let the King’s daughter come here.”Then she went away at once, and told the old King that the man outside there, would have none of her he wanted the King’s daughter.They, however, still had a swine-herd’s daughter, who was even prettier than the miller’s daughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the King’s daughter.So she was taken thither, and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours.She, however, made nothing of it.When day broke, a voice inside the stove cried, “It seems to me it is day outside!”Then answered she, “So it seems to me also; I fancy I hear my father’s horn blowing.”"
"“这么说你是放猪人的女儿！你马上回去，叫公主到这里来，告诉她，必须按她承诺的做。如果她不来，整个王国都要毁灭，所有房屋都要倒塌。”公主闻言后哭了起来。现在，她除了履行承诺外也别无选择。公主向父亲辞别，并在口袋里装了一把刀子，来到森林里的铁炉前。她到那儿后就开始刮铁炉，铁屑居然落了下来。公主用了两个小时就刮出了一个小洞。公主偷偷朝里看了看，看到一个英俊的年轻人，身上满是璀璨的金子和珍贵的珠宝，公主高兴不已。于是，她继续刮铁炉，直到洞口大到王子能够爬出来。王子说：“你属于我，我也属于你。你是我的新娘，你救了我。”王子想带公主回他的王宫，公主恳求王子让她再回去见见父亲，王子答应了。可公主最多只能和父亲说三句话，然后就要立即回来。公主回去了，可她说了不止三句话，铁炉立即消失了，被带到了很远处的玻璃山和锋利的宝剑那里。但王子已被解救出来，不再关在铁炉里了。公主辞别父亲，带了不多的一点钱回到大森林里，她到处找铁炉，却怎么也找不到。公主找了九天，肚子饿得受不了了，她不知道该怎么办，就要活不下去了。夜晚降临后，她坐在一棵小树上，决定就在那里呆一晚，因为她害怕下面有野兽。半夜时分，她看到远处有一点亮光，心想：“啊，我终于有救了！”她爬下树，朝亮光走去，她在路上不停地祈祷。最后，她走到了一栋小旧屋前，屋子周围长满了野草，屋前还放着一小堆柴火。公主心想：“啊，我怎样才能进去呢？”她透过窗户朝里望了望，看到里面只有一群大大小小的蛤蟆，还有一张桌子，上面摆放着酒和烤肉，盘子和杯子都是银制的。于是，公主鼓起勇气敲了敲门。一只胖蛤蟆说道：","“Then thou art a swine-herd’s daughter!Go away at once, and tell the King’s daughter to come, and tell her all must be done as promised, and if she does not come, everything in the kingdom shall be ruined and destroyed, and not one stone be left standing on another.”When the King’s daughter heard that she began to weep, but now there was nothing for it but to keep her promise.So she took leave of her father, put a knife in her pocket, and went forth to the iron stove in the forest.When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron gave way, and when two hours were over, she had already scraped a small hole.Then she peeped in, and saw a youth so handsome, and so brilliant with gold and with precious jewels, that her very soul was delighted.Now, therefore, she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that he was able to get out.Then said he, “Thou art mine, and I am thine; thou art my bride, and hast released me.”He wanted to take her away with him to his kingdom, but she entreated him to let her go once again to her father, and the King’s son allowed her to do so, but she was not to say more to her father than three words, and then she was to come back again.So she went home, but she spoke more than three words, and instantly the iron stove disappeared, and was taken far away over glass mountains and piercing swords; but the King’s son was set free, and no longer shut up in it.After this she bade good-bye to her father, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the great forest, and looked for the iron stove, but it was nowhere to be found.For nine days she sought it, and then her hunger grew so great that she did not know what to do, for she could no longer live.When it was evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up her mind to spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts.When midnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light, and thought, “Ah, there I should be saved!”She got down from the tree, and went towards the light, but on the way she prayed.Then she came to a little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a small heap of wood lay in front of it.She thought, “Ah, whither have I come,” and peeped in through the window, but she saw nothing inside but toads, big and little, except a table well covered with wine and roast meat, and the plates and glasses were of silver.Then she took courage, and knocked at the door.The fat toad cried,"
"“绿色的小姑娘，盘膝的小姑娘，盘腿儿的小狗啊，跳来又跳去，","“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither,"
"快去看看，谁在门外呢。”","And quickly see who is without:”"
"一只小蛤蟆跳过来，给公主打开了门。她进去后，蛤蟆们都欢迎她，还请她坐下。它们问道：“你从哪里来，要到哪里去？”她便向它们讲述了自己的遭遇，说她没遵守说话不能超过三句的诺言，所以，铁炉和王子都消失不见了。现在，她要翻山越岭去寻找王子，直到找到他为止。那只胖蛤蟆说：","and a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her.When she entered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to sit down.They asked, “Where hast thou come from, and whither art thou going?”Then she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had transgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than three words, the stove, and the King’s son also, had disappeared, and now she was about to seek him over hill and dale until she found him.Then the old fat one said,"
"“绿色的小姑娘，盘膝的小姑娘，盘腿儿的小狗啊，跳来又跳去，","“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither,"
"把大盒子拿过来！”","And bring me the great box.”"
"那只小蛤蟆跳过去，把盒子拿了来。之后，它们给公主拿来吃的喝的，又带她来到一张用丝绸和天鹅绒铺着的精致床上，公主躺在床上，安心地睡着了。天亮后，公主起床了。胖蛤蟆从大盒子里拿出三根针送给公主，让她带在身边，公主会用得着它们的，因为公主要翻越一座玻璃山，穿过三把利剑，还要渡过一个大湖泊。如果她能克服这些障碍，就能找回自己的心上人了。接着，胖蛤蟆给了她三样需要好好保管的东西：三根大针、一个犁铧轮和三个坚果。公主带着这些东西继续赶路。她来到玻璃山前，可是玻璃山太光滑了，于是公主将三根针钉在鞋子前后，她就这样翻过了玻璃山。翻过山后，她把三根针藏在了一个地方，并细心地做了标记。之后，她来到那三把锋利的宝剑前，她坐在犁铧轮上，滚过了利剑。最后，她来到大湖泊前，渡过湖后，她就来到了一座又大又漂亮的宫殿前。她走进宫里，要找个活做。她说自己是个穷苦姑娘，想叫人家雇用她。她清楚地知道，她从森林中的铁炉里救出来的王子就在这座宫殿里。她被留下在洗涤室做杂活儿，工钱很少。可是，王子身边已有了另一位姑娘，王子要娶她为妻，因为王子以为公主早已不在人世了。","Then the little one went and brought the box.After this they gave her meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like silk and velvet, and she laid herself therein, in God’s name, and slept.When morning came she arose, and the old toad gave her three needles out of the great box which she was to take with her; they would be needed by her, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, and go over three piercing swords and a great lake.If she did all this she would get her lover back again.Then she gave her three things, which she was to take the greatest care of, namely, three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts.With these she travelled onwards, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first behind her feet and then before them, and so got over it, and when she was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully.After this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated herself on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them.At last she arrived in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she came to a large and beautiful castle.She went and asked for a place; she was a poor girl, she said, and would like to be hired.She knew, however, that the King’s son whom she had released from the iron stove in the great forest was in the castle.Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages.But, already the King’s son had another maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry, for he thought that she had long been dead."
"晚上，公主做完清洗碗盘的工作后，她把手插进口袋里，碰到了老蛤蟆送给她的那三个坚果。她用牙齿咬开一个，准备吃掉果仁，可一瞧，里面竟是一件贵族穿的华丽衣裳。王子的未婚妻听说这件事后，便过来要那件衣裳，想把它买下来，她说：“这不是给婢女穿的衣裳。”可公主拒绝卖给她，除非新娘答应她一个条件，那就是让她在王子的房中过一晚。新娘同意了，因为那件衣裳很漂亮，她以前从没穿过这么漂亮的衣裳。天黑后，她对王子说：“那个傻姑娘要在你房里睡一晚。”王子说：“你要是同意的话，我也没意见。”她给王子喝了一杯酒，她在酒里掺了安眠药。于是，王子和公主共同来到他的房间。可王子睡得很香，公主叫不醒他。","In the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her.She cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel when lo and behold there was a stately royal garment in it!But when the bride heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to buy it, and said, “It is not a dress for a servant-girl.”But she said no, she would not sell it, but if the bride would grant her one thing she should have it, and that was, leave to sleep one night in her bridegroom’s chamber.The bride gave her permission because the dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it.When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, “That silly girl will sleep in thy room.”“If thou art willing so am I,” said he.She, however, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught.So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to sleep in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken him."
"公主哭了整整一夜，她哭着说道：“你被困在森林中的铁炉里，是我救了你。我翻过一座玻璃山，越过三把利剑，又渡过一个大湖泊，终于找到了你，可你却不听我的倾诉！”","She wept the whole night and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!”"
"仆人坐在门口，听到了公主夜里的哭诉。第二天早晨，他把这一切告诉了王子。第二天晚上，公主清洗完碗盘后，打开了第二个坚果，里面是一件更加华丽的衣裳，新娘看到后又想买下来。公主并不想要她的钱，她恳求让新娘，让她在王子的房里再睡一夜。新娘又给王子吃了安眠药，王子又酣睡了一夜，什么也没听到。公主又哭了整整一晚，她哭着说道：“你被困在森林中铁炉里，是我救了你。我翻过一座玻璃山，越过三把利剑，又渡过一个大湖泊，终于找到了你，可你却不听我的倾诉！”仆人坐在门口，又听到了公主夜里的哭诉。第二天早晨，他又把这些告诉了王子。第三天晚上，公主清洗完碗盘后，打开了第三个坚果，坚果里是一件比前两件还要漂亮的衣裳，上面缀着纯金。新娘看到后，想据为己有。可只有新娘允许公主再在王子房里睡一晚，公主才会把衣裳送给她。这次，王子警惕起来，他倒掉了安眠药。公主开始哭诉：“我亲爱的恋人，你被困在可怕的森林里的铁炉里，是我救了你。”王子听到后一跃而起，说道：“你才是我要娶的人。你属于我，我也属于你。”当天晚上，王子和公主就上了一辆马车。他们带走了假新娘的衣服，让她无法下床。他们来到大湖泊边，乘船渡过了湖，来到三把利剑前，坐上犁铧轮滚了过去，又来到玻璃山前，他们插上了那三根针，最后，他们来到那间小旧屋前。可是，当他们走进去时，小屋变成了一座大宫殿，蛤蟆们也被解除了魔法，他们都是国王的子女，大家都兴奋不已。随后，王子和公主举行了婚礼。他俩都住在这座宫殿里，这座宫殿要比他们父亲的大得多。老国王一个人很痛苦。于是，他们便把老国王接了过来，同他们一起生活，这样，他们就拥有了两个王国，从此过着幸福的婚姻生活。","The servants sat by the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the whole night through, and in the morning they told it to their lord.And the next evening when she had washed up, she opened the second nut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it, and when the bride beheld it, she wished to buy that also.But the girl would not take money, and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom’s chamber.The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-drink, and he slept so soundly that he could hear nothing.But the scullery-maid wept the whole night long, and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and over three sharp swords and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!”The servants sat by the chamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through, and in the morning informed their lord of it.And on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the third nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was stiff with pure gold.When the bride saw that she wanted to have it, but the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the third time sleep in the bridegroom’s apartment.The King’s son was, however, on his guard, and threw the sleeping-draught away.Now, therefore, when she began to weep and to cry, “Dearest love, I set thee free when thou wert in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest,” the King’s son leapt up and said, “Thou art the true one, thou art mine, and I am thine.”Thereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took away the false bride’s clothes so that she could not get up.When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and when they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated themselves on the plough-wheel, and when they got to the glass mountain they thrust the three needles in it, and so at length they got to the little old house; but when they went inside that, it was a great castle, and the toads were all disenchanted, and were King’s children, and full of happiness.Then the wedding was celebrated, and the King’s son and the princess remained in the castle, which was much larger than the castles of their fathers.As, however, the old King grieved at being left alone, they fetched him away, and brought him to live with them, and they had two kingdoms, and lived in happy wedlock."

"在很久很久以前，住着三兄弟，他们的生活每况愈下，最后竟然穷得吃不上、喝不上，只能饿着肚子。于是，三个人商量道：“我们可不能再这样下去了啊，应该到外面的世界碰碰运气。”就这样，兄弟三人出发了，他们长途跋涉，走过了一片又一片草地，但始终都没有碰上好运气。一天，他们来到了一片大森林，森林的中间有一座小山，走近一瞧，才发现居然是座银山。老大马上说道：“我已经找到了我梦寐以求的好运气，我再也没有别的奢望了！”他取了尽可能多的银子，一直到搬不动，这才转身回家去了。而他的两个兄弟却说：“银山还不能让我们满足呢，我们要比这更好的运气。”他们连碰也没有碰一下银山，便又上路了。他们马不停蹄地又赶了两天的路，来到了一座金山跟前。老二停下了脚步，他暗暗思量，犹豫不决。“我该怎么做呢？”他说道，“是带走足够的金子让我丰衣足食度过余生，还是继续往前走呢？”最后，他终于下定了决心，在口袋里塞满了金子，一直到塞不下为止，与弟弟告别，也向家走去。但是老三还是坚持道：“金子和银子都不能让我心动，我可不会放弃我的财运，说不定还有更好的东西等着我呢！”他又接着向前赶路，三天之后，他来到了一片森林前，这比之前的那座还要大，宽广无边，怎么走也走不到尽头。但在林子里却找不到一点能充饥解渴的东西，此时他几乎是精疲力尽了。他爬上一棵大树，想看看林子的尽头在哪里，可是映入眼帘的除了树梢之外什么都没有。于是他又从树上爬了下来，但阵阵饥饿又向他袭来，他心想：“要是能饱餐一顿该有多好啊！”他刚一落地，就惊讶地发现树下有一张桌子，上面摆放着丰盛的佳肴，散发着阵阵热气。“这一次，我的愿望在最关键的时刻得到了满足。”老三说道。他坐到桌边，也没有问这些美食是谁带来的、是谁做的，就开始大块朵颐，直到把肚子填得饱饱的。酒足饭饱之后，他想：“把这么漂亮的小桌布留在森林里糟蹋掉实在是太可惜了。”于是他便把桌布折得整整齐齐的，放进了口袋里。他接着向前赶路。到了晚上，他感到肚子又饿了，便想拿他的小桌布来试试。他一边展开桌布一边说道：“我真希望能再有一桌子美味佳肴。”话音刚落，就看见桌上到处摆满了精致的饭菜。“这下我总算知道，”他说道，“我的这些美食是从哪儿来的了。金山也好，银山也罢，我都不稀罕了，你比它们都要宝贵。”因为他清楚地认识到，这是一块能帮人实现愿望的桌布。然而，仅仅凭这一小块桌布，并不能让他安逸地坐在家中，他还要继续四处闯荡，碰碰自己的运气。","There were once three brothers who had fallen deeper and deeper into poverty, and at last their need was so great that they had to endure hunger, and had nothing to eat or drink.Then said they, “We cannot go on thus, we had better go into the world and seek our fortune.”They therefore set out, and had already walked over many a long road and many a blade of grass, but had not yet met with good luck.One day they arrived in a great forest, and in the midst of it was a hill, and when they came nearer they saw that the hill was all silver.Then spoke the eldest, “Now I have found the good luck I wished for, and I desire nothing more.”He took as much of the silver as he could possibly carry, and then turned back and went home again.But the two others said, “We want something more from good luck than mere silver,” and did not touch it, but went onwards.After they had walked for two days longer without stopping, they came to a hill which was all gold.The second brother stopped, took thought with himself, and was undecided.“What shall I do?” said he; “shall I take for myself so much of this gold, that I have sufficient for all the rest of my life, or shall I go farther?”At length he made a decision, and putting as much into his pockets as would go in, said farewell to his brother, and went home.But the third said, “Silver and gold do not move me, I will not renounce my chance of fortune, perhaps something better still will be given me.”He journeyed onwards, and when he had walked for three days, he got into a forest which was still larger than the one before, and never would come to an end, and as he found nothing to eat or to drink, he was all but exhausted.Then he climbed up a high tree to find out if up there he could see the end of the forest, but so far as his eye could pierce he saw nothing but the tops of trees.Then he began to descend the tree again, but hunger tormented him, and he thought to himself, “If I could but eat my fill once more!”When he got down he saw with astonishment a table beneath the tree richly spread with food, the steam of which rose up to meet him.“This time,” said he, “my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment.”And without inquiring who had brought the food, or who had cooked it, he approached the table, and ate with enjoyment until he had appeased his hunger.When he was done, he thought, “It would after all be a pity if the pretty little table-cloth were to be spoilt in the forest here,” and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket.Then he went onwards, and in the evening, when hunger once more made itself felt, he wanted to make a trial of his little cloth, and spread it out and said, “I wish thee to be covered with good cheer again,” and scarcely had the wish crossed his lips than as many dishes with the most exquisite food on them stood on the table as there was room for.“Now I perceive,” said he, “in what kitchen my cooking is done.Thou shalt be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold.”For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth.The cloth, however, was still not enough to enable him to sit down quietly at home; he preferred to wander about the world and pursue his fortune farther."
"一天晚上，在僻静的小树林里他遇到了一个满身尘土、皮肤黝黑的烧炭工。那烧炭工正烧着木炭，烤着晚餐吃的土豆。“晚上好，黑乌鸦！”年轻人说道，“你一个人生活不寂寞么？”","One night he met, in a lonely wood, a dusty, black charcoal-burner, who was burning charcoal there, and had some potatoes by the fire, on which he was going to make a meal.“Good evening, blackbird!” said the youth.“How dost thou get on in thy solitude?”"
"烧炭工回答说：“每天都是这样，每天晚上吃的都是土豆！有没有兴趣做我的客人品尝一下呢？”“太感谢你了。”旅行者答道，“但我不能霸占你的晚餐，你事先也没想到会有访客啊。不过如果你不嫌弃，我想请你和我共进晚餐。”","“One day is like another,” replied the charcoal-burner, “and every night potatoes!Hast thou a mind to have some, and wilt thou be my guest?”“Many thanks,” replied the traveler, “I won’t rob thee of thy supper; thou didst not reckon on a visitor, but if thou wilt put up with what I have, thou shalt have an invitation.”"
"“那谁来为你准备呢？”烧炭工问道，“我看你什么都没有带，而且这方圆两小时路程内也没有人会为你送吃的来。”年轻人回答说：“即便如此，我们依然能吃到晚餐，而且是你从未品尝过的美味佳肴。”接着，他便从他的背包中拿出桌布，把它铺在地上，说道：“小桌布，请摆满佳肴吧。”瞬间，各式煮肉和烤肉摆满了整块桌布，热腾腾的食物就好像刚从厨房端出来的一样。烧炭工惊讶地在一旁目不转睛地看着，还没等他的客人邀请，便抓起食物，大块大块地往他黑黑的嘴里塞。当他们吃完所有的美味后，烧炭工心满意足地笑了起来，并说：“瞧，我很喜欢你的桌布，在这森林里，从来没有人给我做过什么好吃的，这块桌布对我来说太有用了。我想要用其他东西与你交换。你看，在那个角落里有个战士用的背囊，虽然它又旧又简陋，但它蕴藏了神奇的魔力。反正我也不怎么用得着了，不如用它来交换你的桌布。”","“Who is to prepare it for thee?” said the charcoal-burner.“I see that thou hast nothing with thee, and there is no one within a two hours’ walk who could give thee anything.”“And yet there shall be a meal,” answered the youth, “and better than any thou hast ever tasted.”Thereupon he brought his cloth out of his knapsack, spread it on the ground, and said, “Little cloth, cover thyself,” and instantly boiled meat and baked meat stood there, and as hot as if it had just come out of the kitchen.The charcoal-burner stared, but did not require much pressing; he fell to, and thrust larger and larger mouthfuls into his black mouth.When they had eaten everything, the charcoal-burner smiled contentedly, and said, “Hark thee, thy table-cloth has my approval; it would be a fine thing for me in this forest, where no one ever cooks me anything good.I will propose an exchange to thee; there in the corner hangs a soldier’s knapsack, which is certainly old and shabby, but in it lie concealed wonderful powers; but, as I no longer use it, I will give it to thee for the table-cloth.”"
"“那我要先知道它到底有什么神奇的魔力。”年轻人回答道。","“I must first know what these wonderful powers are,” answered the youth."
"“让我来告诉你吧。”烧炭工答道，“每当你拍打这个背囊时，就会出来一个下士和六个战士，他们全部都全副武装，并且会按照你的命令办事。”年轻人听完后说道：“在我看来，如果没别的什么条件，那我们就交换吧。”说着便把桌布给了烧炭工，又从钩子上取下背囊背上后，辞别了烧炭工。走了一阵子，他便想试试这个背囊的魔力，于是用手拍了拍。霎时间，七个勇士出现在他面前，下士说道：“有什么能为老爷效劳的？”","“That will I tell thee,” replied the charcoal-burner; “every time thou tappest it with thy hand, a corporal comes with six men armed from head to foot, and they do whatsoever thou commandest them.”“So far as I am concerned,” said the youth, “if nothing else can be done, we will exchange,” and he gave the charcoal-burner the cloth, took the knapsack from the hook, put it on, and bade farewell.When he had walked a while, he wished to make a trial of the magical powers of his knapsack and tapped it.Immediately the seven warriors stepped up to him, and the corporal said, “What does my lord and ruler wish for?”"
"“全速向烧炭工进发，把我那小桌布带回来。”士兵也没有多问便向左跑去，不一会儿工夫便从烧炭工那儿取回了桌布。年轻人吩咐他们全都退下，自己接着赶路，心里想着能有更好的运气。太阳下山时，他又遇见了另外一个烧炭工，那烧炭工正烧着火准备晚饭。“如果你愿意和我一起尝尝这盐煮的土豆，就来我身边坐下吧，不过没有油水。”那浑身沾满炭灰的家伙说道。","“March with all speed to the charcoal-burner, and demand my wishing-cloth back.”They faced to the left, and it was not long before they brought what he required, and had taken it from the charcoal-burner without asking many questions.The young man bade them retire, went onwards, and hoped fortune would shine yet more brightly on him.By sunset he came to another charcoal-burner, who was making his supper ready by the fire.“If thou wilt eat some potatoes with salt, but with no dripping, come and sit down with me,” said the sooty fellow."
"“不了，”老三回答说，“这回我做东。”说着便铺开他的桌布，上面立即摆满了最棒的菜肴。两个人又吃又喝，非常地尽兴。吃完饭后，烧炭工开口说道：“那个架子上有个破烂不堪的帽子，不过它可有着独特的性能，任何人只要带上它，在头上转动一下，大炮就会开火，好似十二门炮齐齐发射，它能炸毁一切，没有人能抵挡得住它的威力。这帽子对我来说已经没有用了，我想用它来换你的桌布。”","“No, he replied, this time thou shalt be my guest,” and he spread out his cloth, which was instantly covered with the most beautiful dishes.They ate and drank together, and enjoyed themselves heartily.After the meal was over, the charcoal-burner said, “Up there on that shelf lies a little old worn-out hat which has strange properties: when any one puts it on, and turns it round on his head, the cannons go off as if twelve were fired all together, and they shoot down everything so that no one can withstand them.The hat is of no use to me, and I will willingly give it for thy table-cloth.”"
"“那很合我心意。”老三回答说，于是他便带上了帽子，把桌布留给了烧炭工。然而，还没走远，他便拍了拍他的背囊，士兵们又替他取回了桌布。他心里想：“这真是锦上添花，我觉得我的好运还会源源不断的。”他的想法果然很快应验了。赶了整整一天的路，他遇到了第三个烧炭工，与之前一样，烧炭工邀请他吃没有放油的土豆。但他依然和烧炭工一起享用了桌布上的美食。烧炭工非常喜欢这块桌布，便提出要用一个号角与他交换，这个号角的用途和帽子大不一样。只要有人一吹号角，所有的城墙和堡垒都会倒塌，而城镇和村庄也会化成一片废墟。毫无疑问，老三用桌布换下了号角，可是不一会，他便又命令士兵们把它拿了回来。于是到了最后，背囊、帽子和号角这三件宝物都成了他的囊中之物。“是时候了，”他说，“我已经是个成功的人了，我要回去看看我的哥哥们过得怎么样了。”","“That suits me very well,” he answered, took the hat, put it on, and left his table-cloth behind him.Hardly, however, had he walked away than he tapped on his knapsack, and his soldiers had to fetch the cloth back again.“One thing comes on the top of another,” thought he, “and I feel as if my luck had not yet come to an end.”Neither had his thoughts deceived him.After he had walked on for the whole of one day, he came to a third charcoal-burner, who like the previous ones, invited him to potatoes without dripping.But he let him also dine with him from his wishing-cloth, and the charcoal-burner liked it so well, that at last he offered him a horn for it, which had very different properties from those of the hat.When any one blew it all the walls and fortifications fell down, and all towns and villages became ruins.He certainly gave the charcoal-burner the cloth for it, but he afterwards sent his soldiers to demand it back again, so that at length he had the knapsack, hat and horn, all three.“Now,” said he, “I am a made man, and it is time for me to go home and see how my brothers are getting on.”"
"回到家时，他发现两个哥哥已经用那些金子和银子盖起了气派的房子，过着舒适富裕的生活。当他走过去看他们时，因为衣衫褴褛，又戴着破破烂烂的帽子，身上还背着陈旧的背囊，他的哥哥都不愿承认他是自己的弟弟。他们嘲笑他道：“你居然说自己是我们的弟弟，他可是对金子和银子都嗤之以鼻，一心渴望更好的东西。他一定会像趾高气昂的国王那样，乘着马车，一身华丽地回到这里，怎么会和乞丐一样呢。”说着便把他赶出了家门。老三勃然大怒，他不停地拍打他的背囊，直到一百五十个全副武装的士兵排列在他面前。他命令士兵们将哥哥的屋子团团围住，其中两个人手拿榛树棍，狠狠抽打着他那傲慢无礼的哥哥，直到他们认出他为止。这阵剧烈的骚乱很快引来了周围的人们，他们想把那两个可怜的家伙救出来，可是面对那些士兵却又都无能为力了。终于，消息传到了国王耳朵里，国王听后勃然大怒，马上命令一名上尉带着他的部队前往，把破坏宁静的闹事者驱逐出小镇。但是这个背着背囊的年轻人很快召集了更多的士兵，击败了上尉和他的部队，上尉和他的部队被打得落花流水，只好撤退。国王说道：“这个流浪汉太不守纪律了。”第二天便派出了更为强大的部队去对付老三，但这支部队更惨，收效甚微。老三召集了更多的士兵来进行还击，为了让战争尽快结束，他把脑袋上的帽子转了两转，于是那些大炮开始猛烈地攻击，打得国王的军队抱头鼠窜。他接着说：“除非国王把公主嫁给我，并让我代表他统治国家，不然我绝对不会讲和。”他派人把这番话传达给国王，国王听后，便对公主说：“这着实是个棘手的问题，但除了满足他的要求，我还能做什么呢？　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　如果想要和平并保住我头上的王冠，只能把你献出去了。”","When he reached home, his brothers had built themselves a handsome house with their silver and gold, and were living in clover.He went to see them, but as he came in a ragged coat, with his shabby hat on his head, and his old knapsack on his back, they would not acknowledge him as their brother.They mocked and said, “Thou givest out that thou art our brother who despised silver and gold, and craved for something still better for himself.He will come in his carriage in full splendour like a mighty king, not like a beggar,” and they drove him out of doors.Then he fell into a rage, and tapped his knapsack until a hundred and fifty men stood before him armed from head to foot.He commanded them to surround his brothers’ house, and two of them were to take hazel-sticks with them, and beat the two insolent men until they knew who he was.A violent disturbance arose, people ran together, and wanted to lend the two some help in their need, but against the soldiers they could do nothing.News of this at length came to the King, who was very angry, and ordered a captain to march out with his troop, and drive this disturber of the peace out of the town; but the man with the knapsack soon got a greater body of men together, who repulsed the captain and his men, so that they were forced to retire with bloody noses.The King said, “This vagabond is not brought to order yet,” and next day sent a still larger troop against him, but they could do even less.The youth set still more men against them, and in order to be done the sooner, he turned his hat twice round on his head, and heavy guns began to play, and the king’s men were beaten and put to flight.“And now,” said he, “I will not make peace until the King gives me his daughter to wife, and I govern the whole kingdom in his name.”He caused this to be announced to the King, and the latter said to his daughter, “Necessity is a hard nut to crack, what remains to me but to do what he desires?If I want peace and to keep the crown on my head, I must give thee away.”"
"就这样，老三和公主举行了婚礼，但公主却很是苦恼，他的丈夫不仅是个普通人，还戴着破帽、背着旧背囊。她特别想摆脱这个人，日日夜夜都寻思着怎样才能赶走他。她突然想到：“他奇异的魔力莫非就藏在他的背囊里？”于是她开始假意讨好他，等到他心一软，便说：“要是你能把这个丑陋的背囊放在一边多好，它让你显得太难看了，我不禁为你感到羞愧呢。”“亲爱的，”她丈夫说道，“这个背囊可是我最珍贵的宝贝，只要我有了它，世上就没有什么能让我惧怕的了。”接着他便把背囊的神奇魔力透露给了公主。公主投入他的怀抱，装出要吻他的样子，但却敏捷地从他肩上取下了背囊逃跑了。当她跑到没人的地方后，她立刻拍了拍背囊，指挥那些士兵把他们从前的主人捉起来，并把他赶出皇宫。士兵们奉命而去，这个不忠诚的妻子又派了更多的人去，要把他赶出这个国家。要是没有头上的帽子，他肯定就完蛋了。他的双手刚刚获得自由，他便立马把帽子转动了两圈。瞬间，炮声隆隆，炸毁了所有的一切，公主被迫前来求饶。公主的恳求是那样情真意切，并且发誓一定改过，他被说服了，答应和她讲和。公主装出一副友好的样子，表现得好像非常爱他，不多久便把他愚弄了。他又向他的妻子吐露了秘密，即使有人拿走了他的背囊，只要他那破旧的帽子还在，就没人能对付他。得知了这一切，公主便趁他睡着时，偷走了他的帽子，并把它扔到了大街上。可是号角还在他身上，一怒之下，他使劲全身力气吹响了号角。转眼之间，城墙、堡垒、城市和村庄都纷纷倒下，而国王和公主都被压死了。要是他没有放下号角，再多吹那么一小会，所有的一切都会变成废墟，再也看不到两块能叠在一起的石块了。从此以后，再也没有人与他对着干了，他便成为了统治整个国家的国王。","So the wedding was celebrated, but the King’s daughter was vexed that her husband should be a common man, who wore a shabby hat, and put on an old knapsack.She wished much to get rid of him, and night and day studied how she could accomplished this.Then she thought to herself, “Is it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the knapsack?” and she dissembled and caressed him, and when his heart was softened, she said, “If thou wouldst but lay aside that ugly knapsack, it makes disfigures thee so, that I can’t help being ashamed of thee.”“Dear child,” said he, “this knapsack is my greatest treasure; as long as I have it, there is no power on earth that I am afraid of.”And he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was endowed.Then she threw herself in his arms as if she were going to kiss him, but dexterously took the knapsack off his shoulders, and ran away with it.As soon as she was alone she tapped it, and commanded the warriors to seize their former master, and take him out of the royal palace.They obeyed, and the false wife sent still more men after him, who were to drive him quite out of the country.Then he would have been ruined if he had not had the little hat.But his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned it twice.Immediately the cannon began to thunder, and struck down everything, and the King’s daughter herself was forced to come and beg for mercy.As she entreated in such moving terms, and promised amendment, he allowed himself to be persuaded and granted her peace.She behaved in a friendly manner to him, and acted as if she loved him very much, and after some time managed so to befool him, that he confided to her that even if someone got the knapsack into his power, he could do nothing against him so long as the old hat was still his.When she knew the secret, she waited until he was asleep, and then she took the hat away from him, and had it thrown out into the street.But the horn still remained to him, and in great anger he blew it with all his strength.Instantly all walls, fortifications, towns, and villages, toppled down, and crushed the King and his daughter to death.And had he not put down the horn and had blown just a little longer, everything would have been in ruins, and not one stone would have been left standing on another.Then no one opposed him any longer, and he made himself King of the whole country."
"矮人的礼物","The Little Folks’ Presents"
"裁缝和金匠结伴一同旅行。一天傍晚，当太阳落山之后，他们听到从远处传来了阵阵音乐，并且越来越清晰。这乐声听上去有些奇特，但却格外悠扬愉悦，让他们忘记了一路的疲倦，快速地向前走去。走着走着，他们来到了一座小山丘前，这时，月亮已经高高升起。在那里，他们看到了一群小矮人，男男女女手拉着手，兴高采烈地围成一圈，旋转着跳舞。","A tailor and a goldsmith were travelling together, and one evening when the sun had sunk behind the mountains, they heard the sound of distant music, which became more and more distinct.It sounded strange, but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly onwards.The moon had already arisen when they reached a hill on which they saw a crowd of little men and women, who had taken each other’s hands, and were whirling round in the dance with the greatest pleasure and delight."
"矮人们伴着音乐唱歌。这悦耳的旋律正是两位旅行者听到过的。在他们中间坐着一位老人，个子比其他人都要高些。他穿着一件色彩斑斓的大衣，铁灰色的胡子长长地垂到了胸前。两个旅行者万分惊奇，一动不动地站在那儿看着矮人们跳舞。老人向他们示意，让他们进去，于是矮人们热情地打开了圆圈，为他们让路。金匠是一个驼背，正如所有的驼背一样，胆子够大，就走了进去。而裁缝，一开始有些害怕，踌躇着不敢上前，但当他看到所有人都非常欢乐时，便也鼓起勇气跟了进去。矮人们很快又围起了一个圈，载歌载舞，热情奔放。然而老人却从腰带上取下一把大刀开始磨，直到把它磨得足够锋利，接着他转过头来看着两位陌生人。两个人吓坏了，可还没来得及想要怎么办，说时迟那时快，金匠已经被老人一把抓住，他的头发和胡子都被剃光了，而裁缝也没能幸免。但是他们的恐惧很快就烟消云散了，在剃完他们的毛发后，老人友好地拍了拍他们的肩膀，仿佛在说，他们表现得很好，服服帖帖，没有反抗。接着，老人用手指了指身边的一堆煤，向两个旅行者做了手势，示意他们在口袋里装满煤。虽然不知道这些煤对他们有什么用，两人还是都照着老人的话做了，随后他们便继续赶路，想要找个地方过夜。他们走进山谷时，邻近修道院的钟声正好敲响了十二下，歌声停止了。顷刻间，一切都消失不见了，只剩下那座小山丘，在月光下独自耸立。","They sang to it most charmingly, and that was the music which the travellers had heard.In the midst of them sat an old man who was rather taller than the rest.He wore a parti-coloured coat, and his iron-grey beard hung down over his breast.The two remained standing full of astonishment, and watched the dance.The old man made a sign that they should enter, and the little folks willingly opened their circle.The goldsmith, who had a hump, and like all hunchbacks was brave enough, stepped in; the tailor felt a little afraid at first, and held back, but when he saw how merrily all was going, he plucked up his courage, and followed.The circle closed again directly, and the little folks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps.The old man, however, took a large knife which hung to his girdle, whetted it, and when it was sufficiently sharpened, he looked round at the strangers.They were terrified, but they had not much time for reflection, for the old man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed, shaved the hair of his head clean off, and then the same thing happened to the tailor.But their fear left them when, after he had finished his work, the old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a friendly manner, as much as to say, they had behaved well to let all that be done to them willingly, and without any struggle.He pointed with his finger to a heap of coals which lay at one side, and signified to the travellers by his gestures that they were to fill their pockets with them.Both of them obeyed, although they did not know of what use the coals would be to them, and then they went on their way to seek a shelter for the night.When they had got into the valley, the clock of the neighbouring monastery struck twelve, and the song ceased.In a moment all had vanished, and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight."
"两个旅行者找到了一家小旅店，盖着衣服躺在草铺上，然而由于实在是疲惫不堪，他们忘了把口袋里的煤先取出来再躺下。压在他们四肢上沉重的分量使他们醒得比平时都早。他们摸了摸自己的口袋，发现里面装的不是煤而是纯金，这让他们简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。同样令他们高兴的是，他们的头发和胡子都长出来了，而且和从前一样浓密。","The two travellers found an inn, and covered themselves up on their straw-beds with their coats, but in their weariness forgot to take the coals out of them before doing so.A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual.They felt in the pockets, and could not believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with coals, but with pure gold; happily, too, the hair of their heads and beards was there again as thick as ever."
"现在，他们已经是两个有钱人了，而金匠生性贪婪，他把口袋装得更满，足足是裁缝的两倍。一个贪婪的人，即使拥有许多，也还想要更多。于是金匠便向裁缝提议再呆一天，等到晚上再出去一次，这样他们就能从山上的老人那儿得到更多的财宝。裁缝拒绝了，他说：“我有的已经够多了，我心满意足了。现在我可以做师傅了，还能和我亲爱的东西（他如此称呼他的爱人）结婚，我真是个幸福的男人。”但是为了不让金匠扫兴，他还是多呆了一天。晚上，为了能贮藏大量的金子，金匠在肩上又多背了两个口袋，接着便向小山丘进发。和前一晚一样，他又看到了又唱又跳的小矮人们，老人依然剃光了他的头发和胡子，示意他把煤带走。金匠没有半点迟疑，尽可能多地往袋子里塞着煤，然后欣喜若狂地回去，用他的大衣把自己盖上。“即使金子非常重，”他说，“我也心甘情愿地忍受。”最后他进入了甜甜的梦乡，期盼着早上醒来时，自己能变成一个大富翁。","They had now become rich folks, but the goldsmith, who, in accordance with his greedy disposition, had filled his pockets better, was as rich again as the tailor.A greedy man, even if he has much, still wishes to have more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they should wait another day, and go out again in the evening in order to bring back still greater treasures from the old man on the hill.The tailor refused, and said, “I have enough and am content; now I shall be a master, and marry my dear object (for so he called his sweetheart), and I am a happy man.”But he stayed another day to please him.In the evening the goldsmith hung a couple of bags over his shoulders that he might be able to stow away a great deal, and took the road to the hill.He found, as on the night before, the little folks at their singing and dancing, and the old man again shaved him clean, and signed to him to take some coal away with him.He was not slow about sticking as much into his bags as would go, went back quite delighted, and covered himself over with his coat.“Even if the gold does weigh heavily,” said he, “I will gladly bear that,” and at last he fell asleep with the sweet anticipation of waking in the morning an enormously rich man."
"当他睁开眼睛时，便迫不及待地去检查自己的袋子。但令他惊讶的是，无论他掏多少次，口袋里除了黑黑的煤块外，什么也没有。“我前天晚上得到的金子一定还在。”他边思索，边走过去，把金子取出来，可让他震惊的是，那些金子也一样再次变成了煤。他用满是煤灰、黑乎乎的手重重地拍打自己的脑袋，这才发现整个脑袋都是光秃秃的，以前长着胡子的地方也是光秃秃的。但是他的不幸还远远不止这些。他第一次注意到，除了驼背外，自己的胸前也隆起了一个同样大小的包。此时，他意识到了这是在惩罚自己贪得无厌，便开始放声大哭起来。善良的裁缝被金匠的哭声吵醒了，他竭力安慰着倒霉的同伴，说道：“你一直是我旅途中的伙伴，你就留在我的身边，一同分享我的财富吧。”裁缝遵守自己的诺言，而可怜的金匠却必须终身背着两个驼峰，还要用帽子来遮盖自己那光秃秃的脑袋。","When he opened his eyes, he got up in haste to examine his pockets, but how amazed he was when he drew nothing out of them but black coals, and that howsoever often he put his hands in them.“The gold I got the night before is still there for me,” thought he, and went and brought it out, but how shocked he was when he saw that it likewise had again turned into coal.He smote his forehead with his dusty black hand, and then he felt that his whole head was bald and smooth, as was also the place where his beard should have been.But his misfortunes were not yet over; he now remarked for the first time that in addition to the hump on his back, a second, just as large, had grown in front on his breast.Then he recognized the punishment of his greediness, and began to weep aloud.The good tailor, who was wakened by this, comforted the unhappy fellow as well as he could, and said, “Thou hast been my comrade in my travelling time; thou shalt stay with me and share in my wealth.”He kept his word, but the poor goldsmith was obliged to carry the two humps as long as he lived, and to cover his bald head with a cap."
"布拉克尔家的女儿","The Maid of Brakel"
"一次，布拉克尔家的一个女孩来到希内恩堡脚下的圣安妮小教堂。由于她希望能有一个丈夫，又以为四下里没有人，于是便唱道：","A girl from Brakel once went to St. Anne’s Chapel at the foot of the Hinnenberg, and as she wanted to have a husband, and thought there was no one else in the chapel, she sang,"
"“哦，神圣的圣安妮！赶快保佑我有个丈夫吧。您非常了解他，他就住在苏特美门外，有着一头金黄的头发，您非常了解他。”","“Oh, holy Saint Anne!Help me soon to a man.Thou know’st him right well, By Suttmer gate does he dwell, His hair it is golden, Thou know’st him right well.”"
"不过，有一位执事正站在祭坛后，听到了她的祷告，便用粗哑的嗓音说道：“你不会得到他！你不会得到他！”这个女孩还以为此话出自站在母亲安妮身边的小玛丽，她气得喊了起来：“哎呦哟，你这自负的小丫头，快住嘴，让你妈说！” ","The clerk, however, was standing behind the altar and heard that, so he cried in a very gruff voice, “Thou shalt not have him!Thou shalt not have him!”The maiden thought that the child Mary who stood by her mother Anne had called out that to her, and was angry, and cried, “Fiddle de dee, conceited thing, hold your tongue, and let your mother speak!”"
"钉子","The Nail"
"有位商人在一次交易会上生意很好，把所有的货物都卖完了，钱袋里装满了金币银币。于是他打算往家走了，想在傍晚前赶回家里。他把钱装进行李箱里，绑在马背上，骑着马就走了。","A merchant had done good business at the fair; he had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver.Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall.So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away."
"中午的时候，他在一个小镇上休息，正当他要继续赶路时，马童把马拉了出来，说：“先生，您需要一颗钉子，马左后蹄上的蹄铁上少了颗钉子。”“少就少吧，”商人回答，“那蹄铁肯定能坚持得住六英里路，我得赶紧走了。”","At noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said, “A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left hind foot.”“Let it be wanting,” answered the merchant; “the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go.I am in a hurry.”"
"下午，当他再次下马休息，让马童喂马时，马童走进房间对他说：“先生，马左后蹄上的蹄铁丢了。要我把马拉到铁匠那儿去吗？”“丢就丢吧，”商人回答，“只剩几英里路了，马可以顶得住，我着急赶路呢。”","In the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said, “Sir, a shoe is missing from your horse’s left hind foot.Shall I take him to the blacksmith?”“Let it still be wanting,” answered the man; “the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain.I am in haste.”"
"他又继续前行，但没过多久，马就开始一瘸一拐了。这样没走多久，马开始磕磕绊绊起来，没过一会儿，马跌倒在地，折断了腿。商人没办法只好把马留在原地，卸下行李箱扛在自己背上，走着回去了。直到深夜，他才走回了家。“都怪那倒霉的钉子，”他自言自语道，“惹出这么多麻烦。”","He rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp.It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg.The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot.And there he did not arrive until quite late at night.“And that unlucky nail,” said he to himself, “has caused all this disaster.”"
"真是欲速则不达啊。","Hasten slowly."
"七个斯瓦比亚人","The Seven Swabians"
"从前，有七个斯瓦比亚人生活在一起。他们是：老大马斯特·舒尔茨、老二雅克利、老三马利、老四耶格利、老五米夏尔、老六汉斯、老七法伊特利。他们七个都立志要到世界各地去探险，成就一番伟业。但是，为了行路安全，他们手里得有武器，他们认为最好带上一根又长又结实的长矛。矛造好后，他们七人一起抬着这个长矛；最英勇无畏的老大马斯特·舒尔茨走在最前面，其余的人站成一排跟在后面，法伊特利走在最后。七月的一天，正值割晒牧草的时节，他们已经走了很长一段路了，但依然离准备过夜的村庄很远。天色渐渐暗了下来，他们走在一片草地上，一只大甲虫或是黄蜂突然从后面的灌木丛中向他们嗡嗡地袭来，极具威胁性。马斯特·舒尔茨吓得差点儿丢掉了手中的长矛，全身直冒冷汗。“听！听！”他对着他的伙伴们大叫道，“天啊！我听到一阵鼓声。”站在他身后抬着矛的雅克利闻到了某种气味，说道：“肯定发生什么事了，因为我闻到了一股火药和火柴的味道。”一听到这些话，马斯特·舒尔茨调头就跑，一转眼就跨过了树篱，但他正好跳到了刚晒完草被扔在一边的耙子的齿上。耙子柄打在他的脸上，给了他狠狠一击。“哦，天啊！哦，天啊！”马斯特·舒尔茨大叫了起来。“我愿意当俘虏，我投降！我投降！”其余六个也全跳了起来，一个比一个大声地叫道：“你投降，我也投降！你投降，我也投降！”过了很长一段时间，没有敌人将他们捆绑带走，他们才意识到自己搞错了。为了不让这个事情泄露出去，让别人觉得他们很蠢、很荒诞，他们相互发誓死守秘密，直到其中一个人不小心说漏了嘴为止。于是，他们继续前行。他们侥幸逃脱的第二次危险比这次要险恶得多。几天以后，他们沿路走进了一片休耕地，一只兔子正蹲坐在太阳下睡觉。它的耳朵高高竖起，玻璃球般的眼睛睁得大大的。看到这只恐怖的野兽，他们都害怕极了，便一起商量着怎样做才能让危险降至最低。因为，如果逃跑的话，他们认为那只怪物会紧追上来把他们囫囵吞掉。于是，他们说：“我们必须进行殊死一搏。敢于冒险就算成功一半了。”于是七个人一起抬起长矛，马斯特·舒尔茨在前，法伊特利在后。马斯特·舒尔茨总是将矛往后缩，但后面的法伊特利却变得异常勇敢，总想往前冲，还大叫着：","Seven Swabians were once together.The first was Master Schulz; the second, Jackli; the third, Marli; the fourth, Jergli; the fifth, Michal; the sixth, Hans; the seventh, Veitli: all seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures, and perform great deeds.But in order that they might go in security and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them.This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once; in front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was Master Schulz; all the others followed in a row, and Veitli was the last.Then it came to pass one day in the hay-making month (July), when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner.Master Schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold perspiration broke out over his whole body.“Hark! hark!” cried he to his comrades, “Good heavens! I hear a drum.”Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and who perceived some kind of a smell, said, “Something is most certainly going on, for I taste powder and matches.”At these words Master Schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow.“Oh dear! Oh dear!” screamed Master Schulz.“Take me prisoner; I surrender! I surrender!”The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, “If you surrender, I surrender too!If you surrender, I surrender too!”At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them accidentally spoke of it.Then they journeyed onwards.The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first.Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun.Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open.All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do.For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole.So they said, “We must go through a great and dangerous struggle.Boldly ventured, is half won,” and all seven grasped the spear, Master Schulz in front, and Veitli behind.Master Schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but Veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried,"
"“冲啊，以全体斯瓦比亚人的名义，否则我会诅咒你们变成跛子。”","“Strike home, in every Swabian’s name, or else I wish ye may be lame.”"
"但汉斯清楚怎么应对，说道：","But Hans knew how to meet this, and said,"
"“你光打雷不下雨，老是穷嚷嚷，一动真格的，你就落后。”　","“Thunder and lightning, it’s fine to prate, but for dragon-hunting thou’rt aye too late.”"
"米夏尔叫到：","Michal cried,"
"“千真万确，分毫不差，他就是个不折不扣的魔鬼。”","“Nothing is wanting, not even a hair, be sure the Devil himself is there.”"
"然后，轮到耶格利说话了：","Then it was Jergli’s turn to speak,"
"“就算他不是魔鬼，也至少是魔鬼的儿子，或是魔鬼同父异母的兄弟。”","“If it be not, it’s at least his mother, or else it’s the Devil’s own step-brother.”"
"突然，马利灵机一动，对法伊特利说：","And now Marli had a bright thought, and said to Veitli,"
"“往前冲，法伊特利，往前冲，往前冲，我在后面会握住长矛的。”","“Advance, Veitli, advance, advance, and I behind will hold the lance.”"
"但法伊特利并没有听马利的话，于是耶格利接着说：","Veitli, however, did not attend to that, and Jackli said,"
"“舒尔茨应该站在最前面，除了他之外，没有人配得上这样的荣誉。”","“Tis Schulz’s place the first to be, no one deserves that honor but he.”"
"于是，舒尔茨鼓足勇气，神情凝重地说：","Then Master Schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,"
"“那就让我们勇敢地向前冲，开始战斗吧，这样才能展现出我们的勇猛和威力。”","“Then let us boldly advance to the fight, and thus we shall show our valour and might.”"
"于是，他们一起向恶魔发起了进攻。马斯特·舒尔茨在胸前画了十字架以祈求上帝的帮助，但是这一切似乎都无济于事。他一边向敌人靠近，一边痛苦万分地尖叫着：“哎哟！哎哟！啊！啊！啊！”叫声惊动了野兔，它吓了一大跳，飞快逃跑了。看到野兔飞速逃离了战场，马斯特·舒尔茨高兴地大叫了起来：","Hereupon they all together set on the dragon.Master Schulz crossed himself and prayed for God’s assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed “Oho! oho! ho! ho! ho!” in the greatest anguish.This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away.When Master Schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy."
"“快，法伊特利，快，看那里，那里，那怪兽只不过是只野兔！”","“Quick, Veitli, quick, look there, look there, the monster’s nothing but a hare!”"
"但随后，这几个斯瓦比亚人还继续寻找新的冒险。他们到了摩泽尔河，那是一条幽静的、布满青苔的深河，河上几乎没有桥，因此在很多地方，人们都需要乘船过河。由于七个斯瓦比亚人并不知道这些，便问正在河对岸干活的人怎样才能过河。因为两岸距离太远，他们又听不懂彼此的语言，河对岸的那个人无法理解他们到底需要什么，那个人用特里尔附近的语言问道：“什么？什么？”","But the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats.As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across.The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said “What? what?” in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves."
"马斯特·舒尔茨还以为他在说：“趟过来，趟水过来。”因为他排在最前头，所以他第一个踏入了摩泽尔河。不一会儿，他就陷入烂泥里了，河里的大浪击打着他，但他的帽子被风吹到了对岸，一只青蛙蹲在帽子旁边“呱呱呱”地叫着。河岸这边的六个人听到这叫声，便说：“哎哟，朋友们，马斯特·舒尔茨正在叫我们呢，如果他能趟过去，我们为什么不能呢？”于是，他们六人一起慌忙地跳进了水中，结果全都被淹死了。就这样，一只青蛙要了六条人命，这几个斯瓦比亚人没有一个活着回家的。","Master Schulz thought he was saying, “Wade, wade through the water,” and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle.It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked “Wat, wat, wat.”The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, “Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?”So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again."
"能歌善舞的百灵鸟","The Singing, Springing Lark"
"从前有一个人，他要动身去很远很远的地方。出发之前，他问他的三个女儿，她们想要他带回什么东西。大女儿想要珍珠，二女儿想要钻石，而小女儿却说：“亲爱的父亲，我想要一只能歌善舞的百灵鸟。”父亲说：“好的，要是我能找到那种百灵鸟的话，我一定会给你的。”他吻别三个女儿，然后便出发了。等他快回家时，他给大女儿和二女儿带了珍珠和钻石，可他四处寻找，却没能找到一只能歌善舞的百灵鸟送给小女儿。为此他感到很沮丧，因为小女儿是她最喜爱的孩子。后来，他穿过一片森林，森林中有一座宏伟的宫殿，宫殿旁长着一棵树。他看到，就在树顶上，有一只能歌善舞的百灵鸟。他说道：“啊，你出现得正是时候！”他很兴奋，让随从爬到树上去抓那只小百灵鸟。随从刚靠近那棵树，一头狮子就从树下跳了出来，狮子咆哮着，震得树叶都颤抖起来。他喊道：“谁偷我能歌善舞的百灵鸟，我就吃了谁。”小女孩的父亲说：“我不知道这只百灵鸟是你的。我为我的错误行为道歉，只要你能饶了我，我愿意给你一大笔钱作为补偿。”狮子说：“什么都救不了你，除非你答应，把你回家后第一眼见到的东西送给我。你要是同意了，我就饶你一命，你还可以把这只百灵鸟带给你女儿。”父亲却犹豫了，他说道：“那很可能是我的小女儿啊，她最爱我，总是在我回家的时候跑出来迎接我。”可是，随从很害怕，说：“你第一眼看到的就一定是你小女儿吗？也许是一只猫，或一条狗呢？”那位父亲就这样被说服了。他把百灵鸟带走了，而且答应，不论他回家后第一眼看见什么东西，都会送给狮子。","There was once on a time a man who was about to set out on a long journey, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should bring back with him for them.Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, “Dear father, I should like a singing, soaring lark.”The father said, “Yes, if I can get it, you shall have it,” kissed all three, and set out.Now when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he had brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and he was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child.Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid castle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the tree, he saw a singing, soaring lark.“Aha, you come just at the right moment!” he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature.But as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook himself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled.“He who tries to steal my singing, soaring lark,” he cried, “will I devour.”Then the man said, “I did not know that the bird belonged to thee.I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a large sum of money, only spare my life.”The lion said, “Nothing can save thee, unless thou wilt promise to give me for mine own what first meets thee on thy return home; and if thou wilt do that, I will grant thee thy life, and thou shalt have the bird for thy daughter, into the bargain.”But the man hesitated and said, “That might be my youngest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on my return home.”The servant, however, was terrified and said, “Why should your daughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog?”Then the man allowed himself to be over-persuaded, took the singing, soaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first meet him on his return home."
"他回到家，刚走进家门，第一个出来迎接他的恰恰是他最喜爱的小女儿。她跑上前，亲吻并拥抱她的父亲。当她看到父亲真给她带回一只能歌善舞的百灵鸟后，简直乐坏了。可父亲不但不高兴，反而抽泣起来，他说：“我最喜爱的女儿啊，我花了很大代价才弄到了这只百灵鸟。为了弄到它，我被迫答应一头凶猛的狮子，把你送给它作为交换。它得到你后会把你撕成碎片吃掉的。”他把这一切都如实地告诉了小女儿，叮嘱她，不管发生什么事情，千万不要到狮子那里去。小女儿却安慰他说：“亲爱的父亲，你答应的事情一定要做到啊。我会到狮子那里去，想办法感化它，这样我就能安然无恙地回到你身边了。”第二天早上，她让父亲指给她路，然后便出发了。她毫不畏惧地朝森林走去。狮子其实是一位被施了魔法的王子。白天，他和随从们就变成狮子，到晚上，他们又会恢复人的模样。女孩来到后，受到热烈的欢迎，她被领进了宫殿。夜幕降临，狮子变成一个英俊的男子。他和女孩举行了隆重的婚礼。他们一起过着幸福的生活，晚上活动，白天睡觉。一天，王子来到女孩面前说：“明天你父亲家里要举行一场盛宴，你大姐要出嫁了。要是你想去的话，我让狮子们领着你去。”女孩说：“好的，我也真想见见我的父亲了。”女孩便在狮子们的陪伴下去了父亲家。女孩到来后，大家都很惊喜。他们以为女孩早就被狮子撕成碎片吃掉了。女孩告诉他们，她嫁给了一位英俊的王子，过着幸福的生活。她和大家一起享用了盛宴，之后就返回森林里去了。当她二姐要出嫁时，女孩又收到邀请去参加婚礼。她对狮子说：“这次我不想独自回去了，你要陪我一起去。”可狮子却说，这对他来说太危险了。一旦蜡烛的光线照射到他，他就会变成一只鸽子。在将来七年的时间里，只能和其他的鸽子一起四处飞翔。她说：“哎，你还是跟我一起去吧。我会好好照顾你的，绝不让任何光线照射到你。”于是他们带着他们的小孩子一起出发了。她让人在父亲家建了一间屋子。那间屋子十分结实，墙壁也很厚实，没有光线能够透进来。当婚宴的蜡烛被点燃时，王子便可以把自己关在那间屋里了。然而，房门是用一块有点变形的生材做的。门上有一道小缝隙，但没有一个人注意到。婚礼很热闹，可是，当一行人举着蜡烛和火把从教堂回来，经过那间屋子时，头发丝一样细的一缕光线照到了王子身上，王子瞬间变成了一只鸽子。女孩进屋找他，却找不到，她只看见一只白色的鸽子坐在那里。鸽子对她说：“在这七年的时间里，我必须到处飞行。但你每走七步，我就会洒下一滴鲜红的血，留下一根白色的羽毛，它们会为你指路。只要你循着它们的痕迹走，你就能救我。”说完，鸽子飞出了屋子。女孩跟随着他，每走七步，就会有一滴鲜红的血和一根小的白色羽毛落下来，给她指路。","When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up, kissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with him a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy.The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, “My dearest child, I have bought the little bird dear.In return for it, I have been obliged to promise thee to a savage lion, and when he has thee he will tear thee in pieces and devour thee,” and he told her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what might.But she consoled him and said, “Dearest father, indeed your promise must be fulfilled.I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I may return to thee safely.”Next morning she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest.The lion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all his people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes.On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle.When night came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was celebrated with great magnificence.They lived happily together, remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime.One day he came and said, “Tomorrow there is a feast in thy father’s house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if thou art inclined to go there, my lions shall conduct thee.”She said, “Yes, I should very much like to see my father again,” and went thither, accompanied by the lions.There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that she had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live.But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was, remained with them while the wedding feast lasted, and then went back again to the forest.When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion, “This time I will not be alone, thou must come with me.”The lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle fell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the doves.She said, “Ah, but do come with me, I will take great care of thee, and guard thee from all light.”So they went away together, and took with them their little child as well.She had a chamber built there, so strong and thick that no ray could pierce through it; in this he was to shut himself up when the candles were lit for the wedding feast.But the door was made of green wood which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed.The wedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession with all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by this apartment, a ray about the bredth of a hair fell on the King’s son, and when this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant, and when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a white dove was sitting there.The dove said to her, “For seven years must I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I will let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will show thee the way, and if thou followest the trace thou canst release me.”Thereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and at every seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather fell down and showed her the way."
"于是，女孩在茫茫的世上不停地走啊走，越走越远。她从不四处张望，也不停下来休息，七年终于快过去了。女孩高兴极了，心想他们很快就获救了。然而，他们隔那一天还挺远。一天，他们仍继续向前走，可既没有羽毛也没有鲜血落下来。女孩抬起头来仰望，鸽子已不见了踪影。女孩心想：“这下没人能帮我了。”她找到太阳，对太阳说：“你能照进每一条裂缝，照到每一处山峰的顶端，你见过一只飞翔的白鸽吗？”太阳答道：“没有，我没见过。不过我可以给你一个匣子，在你最需要的时候打开它。”女孩谢过太阳后就继续赶路了，一直走到夜幕降临，月亮出来了。女孩便问月亮：“你照亮整个夜晚，光辉洒满田野和森林，你看见过一只飞翔的白鸽吗？”月亮答道：“没有，我没看见过白鸽。不过，我可以给你一个蛋，在你最需要的时候敲碎它。”女孩谢过月亮继续赶路。后来晚风刮了起来，于是她便对晚风说：“你吹过每一棵树木，拂过每一片叶子，你看见过一只飞翔的白鸽吗？”晚风答道：“没有，我没有见过白鸽。不过我可以帮你问问其他三种风，也许它们见过呢。”东风和西风来了，可它们什么也没看见，而南风却说：“我见过白鸽。它飞到了红海，在那里又变回了狮子，因为七年的时间已经过去了。他正和一条龙搏斗呢。那条龙是一位被施了魔法的公主。”晚风对她说：“我想出了个办法。你到红海去。在右堤岸上有一些高高的芦苇，你拔下第十一棵芦苇，用它抽打那条龙，那样狮子就能制服它了。他俩也都会恢复人形。然后，你看看周围，就会看到红海边站着一只狮身鹰首兽。你和王子赶紧爬到它背上，它会带你们飞越红海，把你们带回家。我给你一个坚果。当你们飞到红海中央时，就把坚果抛下去。它会迅速生长，在水中长成一棵高大的坚果树。狮身鹰首兽就可以在树上休息了。如果它不能休息，就没有力气把你们送过红海了。但如果你忘记了扔下那个坚果，它就会把你们丢到海里去。”","So she went continually further and further in the wide world, never looking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past; then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and yet they were so far from it!Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the dove had disappeared.And as she thought to herself, “In this no man can help thee,” she climbed up to the sun, and said to him, “Thou shinest into every crevice, and over every peak, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?”“No,” said the sun, “I have seen none, but I present thee with a casket, open it when thou art in sorest need.”Then she thanked the sun, and went on until evening came and the moon appeared; she then asked her, “Thou shinest the whole night through, and on every field and forest, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?”“No,” said the moon, “I have seen no dove, but here I give thee an egg, break it when thou art in great need.”She thanked the moon, and went on until the night wind came up and blew on her, then she said to it, “Thou blowest over every tree and under every leaf, hast thou not seen a white dove flying?”“No,” said the night wind, “I have seen none, but I will ask the three other winds, perhaps they have seen it.”The east wind and the west wind came, and had seen nothing, but the south wind said, “I have seen the white dove, it has flown to the Red Sea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven years are over, and the lion is there fighting with a dragon; the dragon, however, is an enchanted princess.”The night wind then said to her, “I will advise thee; go to the Red Sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds, count them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon with it, then the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will regain their human form.After that, look round and thou wilt see the griffin which is by the Red Sea; swing thyself, with thy beloved, on to his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own home.Here is a nut for thee, when thou are above the center of the sea, let the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest; for if he cannot rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across, and if thou forgettest to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea.”"
"女孩来到红海，发现一切跟晚风所描述的一样。她数了数岸边的芦苇，拔下第十一棵，用它抽打那条龙，狮子战胜了龙。狮子和龙立即恢复了人形。可是，那条龙被解除魔法变回公主后，便挽起王子的胳膊，和王子一起坐到狮身鹰首兽背上，飞走了。可怜的女孩站在那里，她跋涉了那么远，现在却被抛弃了。女孩坐下哭了起来，最后，她鼓起勇气，说道：“我要继续走，凡是风能吹得到的地方，凡是有公鸡鸣叫的地方，我都要去，直到找到他。”女孩走了很远很远，最后终于来到公主和王子居住的宫殿。她听说，他们很快就要举行一场盛宴，庆祝公主和王子的婚礼。女孩说：“上帝会帮助我的，”她打开了太阳送给她的那只匣子。匣子里放着一条如太阳般光彩照人的裙子。女孩拿出裙子穿上，来到了宫殿里。所有人，甚至连新娘本人，都吃惊地望着她。新娘非常喜欢这条裙子，想用它作婚纱，便问女孩卖不卖这条裙子。女孩答道：“金钱土地换不到，但是可以用肉与血来交换。”新娘问女孩说这话是什么意思，女孩说：“让我在新郎的睡房里睡一夜。”新娘虽不情愿，可由于太想要那条裙子，最后便同意了。佣人奉命给王子吃了一些安眠药。晚上，王子睡熟后，女孩便被领到了王子的房间。她坐在床边，对王子说道：“我跟随着你长途跋涉了七年。我曾去找太阳、月亮和四方的风，只为打听到你的下落，我曾帮你制服那条龙。难道你真的忘记我了吗？”可王子睡得太香，女孩的话对王子来说，就像风吹过外面的冷杉林发出的沙沙声。天亮后，女孩被领出房间，她只得把那条金色的裙子送了出去。由于这个办法不管用，女孩很伤心，她来到外面的草地上，坐在那哭了起来。她正坐在那时，忽然想起月亮送给她的那个蛋。她敲碎蛋，从里面蹦出一只咯咯叫的老母鸡和十二只金色的小鸡。它们鸣叫着四处跑开，又不时钻到老母鸡的翅膀下。世界上没有什么比这景象更美的了！于是女孩站起身，轰赶着鸡群穿过草地，直到新娘透过窗户看到它们。新娘非常喜欢这些小鸡，她立即跑下来问女孩，那些小鸡卖不卖。“金钱土地换不到，但是可以用肉和血来交换。让我在新郎的睡房里睡一夜。”新娘答道：“行。”她打算像昨晚一样蒙骗女孩。可是，当王子上床时，他问随从昨晚的沙沙声是怎么回事。随从把一切如实地告诉了王子。他说他奉命给王子吃安眠药，因为有一个可怜的女孩要在王子房间里秘密地睡一夜。今晚，公主还要他给王子吃安眠药。王子说：“把药放在床边吧。”晚上，女孩又被带了进来。当她开始讲述自己的不幸遭遇时，听到她的声音，王子立即认出她正是自己亲爱的妻子。他跳起来，喊道：“现在我真的得救了！我过去一直像是在做梦。那个陌生的公主对我施了魔法，我被迫忘了你。可是上帝在这个恰当的时间为我破解了符咒，我得救了。”由于害怕公主那个巫士父亲，他们二人连夜悄悄离开了宫殿。他们坐到那只狮身鹰首兽背上，它带着他们飞越红海。当它飞到红海中央时，女孩扔下了那颗坚果。一棵高大的坚果树立即长了出来。狮身鹰首兽在树上稍稍休息后，就带他们飞回了家。到家后，他们见到了自己的孩子，他已经长成高大英俊的小伙子了。从那以后，他们一辈子都过着幸福的生活。","Then she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had said.She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the dragon therewith, whereupon the lion overcame it, and immediately both of them regained their human shapes.But when the princess, who had before been the dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the youth by the arm, seated herself on the griffin, and carried him off with her.There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again forsaken.She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and said, “Still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the cock crows, until I find him,” and she went forth by long, long roads, until at last she came to the castle where both of them were living together; there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which they would celebrate their wedding, but she said, “God still helps me,” and opened the casket that the sun had given her.A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself.So she took it out and put it on, and went up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her with astonishment.The dress pleased the bride so well that she thought it might do for her wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale?“Not for money or land,” answered she, “but for flesh and blood.”The bride asked her what she meant by that, so she said, “Let me sleep a night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.”The bride would not, yet wanted very much to have the dress; at last she consented, but the page was to give the prince a sleeping-draught.When it was night, therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into the chamber; she seated herself on the bed and said, “I have followed after thee for seven years.I have been to the sun and the moon, and the four winds, and have enquired for thee, and have helped thee against the dragon; wilt thou, then quite forget me?”But the prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees.When therefore day broke, she was led out again, and had to give up the golden dress.And as that even had been of no avail, she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept.While she was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her; she opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens all of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the old hen’s wings; nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world!Then she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until the bride looked out of the window.The little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale.“Not for money or land, but for flesh and blood; let me sleep another night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.”The bride said, “Yes,” intending to cheat her as on the former evening.But when the prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been．On this the page told all; that he had been forced to give him a sleeping-draught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in the chamber, and that he was to give him another that night.The prince said, “Pour out the draught by the bed-side.”At night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill all had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by her voice, sprang up and cried, “Now I really am released!I have been as it were in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me so that I have been compelled to forget thee, but God has delivered me from the spell at the right time.”Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared the father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated themselves on the griffin which bore them across the Red Sea, and when they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut.Immediately a tall nut tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home, where they found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful, and they lived thenceforth happily until their death."
"六个仆人","The Six Servants"
"从前，有一位年老的王后，她精通巫术。她的女儿算是天底下最漂亮的姑娘了。老巫婆一门心思算计人。当有人向她女儿求婚时，她便说，不管谁想娶她女儿，都要先完成一项任务，否则就得送命。许多人都为姑娘的美丽所倾倒，纷纷前来冒险，可没人能完成老巫婆吩咐的任务。他们也没得到任何怜悯，只得双膝跪地，让人砍下头颅。有位王子也听说了公主的美貌，便对父亲说：“让我也去吧，我想娶她为妻。”国王回答道：“不行，你去了也一样会送命的。”为此，王子一病不起，卧病在床七年，没有医生能治得好他。国王意识到没有希望了，他怀着沉重的心情对王子说：“去吧，去碰碰运气，别的方法根本治不好你。”听到这些话，王子从床上坐起，病也痊愈了，他高高兴兴地上路了。王子骑着马经过一片荒野，远远地看到地面上好像有一堆干草。走近才看清，原来是一个人的肚子。他躺在那里，肚子像一座小山似的。看到王子，胖子站了起来，说道：“要是你需要人手的话，就让我为你效力吧。”王子答道：“我带着你这样一个胖子能做什么呢？”胖子说：“噢，这不算什么啊，我要是伸展一下的话，能比现在大三千倍呢。”王子说：“要是那样的话，说不定我能用得着你。跟我走吧。”胖子就这样追随了王子。走了一会儿，他们看到了一个人，躺在地上，耳朵贴着草地。王子问道：“你干什么呢？”他回答：“我在听呢。”“你在听什么呢，听得那么认真？”“我在听现在世界上发生的事情。没有任何事情能逃得过我的耳朵，我甚至能听到小草生长的声音。”王子问：“那你告诉我，在那个有位漂亮女儿的老巫婆的皇宫中，你听到了什么？”他答道：“我听到刀剑挥舞的搜搜声，那是一个求婚者被砍去头颅。”王子说：“我能用得着你，跟我走吧。”他们继续赶路，突然看到一双脚，还有一截腿，却看不到身体的其他部分。他们紧接着走了挺远一段路，才看到躯干，又走了一会，才看到脑袋。王子说：“呀，多棒的高竿子啊！”高个子回答道：“噢，这还不算什么，我要是把四肢伸展开的话，会高出三千倍，比世界上最高的山还要高。如果你愿意带着我，我很高兴为你效力。”王子说：“跟我走吧，我能用得着你。”他们继续赶路，看到路边坐着一个蒙着眼睛的人。王子对他说：“是不是你视力不好，不敢见阳光？”那人回答道：“不是。我不能扯掉那块绷带，否则，我所看到的东西都会变成碎片。我的眼光有非凡的能量。如果你用得上我，我很愿意为你效力。”王子答道：“跟我走吧，我能用得着你。”他们又上路了，看到一个人躺在火辣辣的太阳下，却浑身发抖，身上没有一处不动的。王子说：“阳光这么暖和，你怎么还是瑟瑟发抖呢？”他答道：“唉，我天生与人不一样。天气越热，我就越觉得冷，寒冷都渗进我骨头里了。天气越冷，我越觉得暖和。要是我呆在冰里，我会热得不行。要是我呆在火里，我会冷得要命。”王子说：“你真是个怪人。如果你愿意为我效力的话，那就跟我们一块走吧。”他们继续赶路，看到前方站着一个人，伸长脖子四处张望，能一直望到高山的背面。王子说：“你这么急切地看什么呢？”那人回答说：“我眼光很犀利，能看透世界上所有的森林、田野、山脉和峡谷。”王子说：“你要是愿意，就跟我走吧。我需要像你这样的人。”","In former times there lived an aged Queen who was a sorceress, and her daughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun.The old woman, however, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to destruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever wished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die.Many had been dazzled by the daughter’s beauty, and had actually risked this, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined them to do, and then no mercy was shown; they had to kneel down, and their heads were struck off.A certain King’s son who had also heard of the maiden’s beauty, said to his father, “Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage.”“Never,” answered the King; “if you were to go, it would be going to your death.”On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and for seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him.When the father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he said to him, “Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other means of curing you.”When the son heard that, he rose from his bed and was well again, and joyfully set out on his way.And it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from afar something like a great heap of hay lying on the ground, and when he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man, who had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small mountain.When the fat man saw the traveller, he stood up and said, “If you are in need of any one, take me into your service.”The prince answered, “What can I do with such a great big man?”“Oh,” said the Stout One, “this is nothing, when I stretch myself out well, I am three thousand times fatter.”“If that’s the case,” said the prince, “I can make use of thee, come with me.”So the Stout One followed the prince, and after a while they found another man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the turf.“What art thou doing there?” asked the King’s son.“I am listening,” replied the man.“What art thou listening to so attentively?”“I am listening to what is just going on in the world, for nothing escapes my ears; I even hear the grass growing.”“Tell me,” said the prince, “what thou hearest at the court of the old Queen who has the beautiful daughter.”Then he answered, “I hear the whizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer’s head.”The King’s son said, “I can make use of thee, come with me.”They went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a pair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body.When they had walked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to the head also.“Why,” said the prince, “what a tall rascal thou art!”“Oh,” replied the Tall One, “that is nothing at all yet; when I really stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and taller than the highest mountain on earth.I will gladly enter your service, if you will take me.”“Come with me,” said the prince, “I can make use of thee.”They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes.The prince said to him, “Hast thou weak eyes, that thou canst not look at the light?”“No,” replied the man, “but I must not remove the bandage, for whatsoever I look at with my eyes, splits to pieces, my glance is so powerful.If you can use that, I shall be glad to serve you.”“Come with me,” replied the King’s son, “I can make use of thee.”They journeyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot sunshine, trembling and shivering all over his body, so that not a limb was still.“How canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm?” said the King’s son.“Alack,” replied the man, “I am of quite a different nature.The hotter it is, the colder I am, and the frost pierces through all my bones; and the colder it is, the hotter I am.In the midst of ice, I cannot endure the heat, nor in the midst of fire, the cold.”“Thou art a strange fellow,” said the prince, “but if thou wilt enter my service, follow me.”They travelled onwards, and saw a man standing who made a long neck and looked about him, and could see over all the mountains.“What art thou looking at so eagerly?” said the King’s son.The man replied, “I have such sharp eyes that I can see into every forest and field, and hill and valley, all over the world.”The prince said, “Come with me if thou wilt, for I am still in want of such an one.”"
"就这样，王子和他的六个手下来到了老巫婆居住的王宫。他没有告诉老巫婆自己是谁，而是说：“如果你能把漂亮的女儿嫁给我，你有什么任务我都会替你完成。”有这样一位英俊的年轻人中计，老巫婆很高兴，她说：“我会交给你三个任务，如果你都能完成，那你就可以娶我女儿，还可以支配她。”“第一个任务是什么？”“我的戒指掉进了红海里，你去给我捡回来。”王子找到他的手下说：“第一个任务很难办。我们要去红海里找一枚戒指。抓紧点，想想有什么办法。”有着犀利眼光的人说：“我来看看戒指掉到哪了。”他望向海底，说：“戒指落在一块尖尖的礁石上了。”高个子把他们背到了那里，说：“只要能看清楚，我很快就能把戒指取出来。”胖子喊道：“噢，这好办！”他俯下身，把嘴贴在水面上，海水如同漩涡般被他吸进了嘴里。他喝干了所有的海水，大海干得像块草地。高个子微微弯下腰，用手取出了戒指。王子拿到戒指后很高兴，他把戒指交给了老巫婆。老巫婆很吃惊，说：“没错，就是这枚戒指。你安全完成了第一个任务，现在是第二个任务。你看到王宫前的那块牧场了吗？那里喂有三百头肥牛，你要把这些都吃了，包括毛发、骨头和牛角。在我的地窖里有三百桶酒，你要把它们喝光。如果剩下一根牛毛或一滴酒，那你就得送命了。”王子问道：“我可以请人来吃吗？没人陪伴，吃什么也不香啊。”老巫婆恶毒地笑起来，回答道：“你只可以请一个人作伴，不能再多了。”王子去找手下，对胖子说：“今天你是我的客人，我请你饱餐一顿。”于是，胖子鼓起大肚子，吃掉了三百头牛，一根牛毛都没剩下。他还问，除了早饭，还有什么可以吃的。他不用杯子，直接拿起桶把那300桶酒喝光了，指甲上的最后一滴酒也被他添光了。吃完后，王子来到老巫婆跟前，告诉她第二个任务也完成了。她很吃惊，说：“还从来没有人能完成这么多任务。你还有一个任务。”她暗自想：“你逃不掉的，我要让你人头落地！”她说：“今晚我会把女儿带到你房间，你要用手抱住她，你俩就这样一起坐着，当心别睡着了。十二点的时候，我会过来。那时她要是不在你身边，我就杀了你。”王子心想：“这个任务很简单，我努力瞪大眼睛就行了。”可他还是叫来了手下，把老巫婆吩咐的任务告诉他们，王子说：“谁知道这背后暗藏什么阴谋呢？盯紧点没坏处，注意别让她女儿逃出房间。”夜幕降临，老巫婆把她女儿带来了，并让王子抱住她女儿。高个子将身体蜷成一个蜷，把俩人围在了里面。胖子则守住门口，没人能钻进来。俩人坐在那里，姑娘一句话也不说。月光透过窗户照在她的脸上，王子终于看到了她的美貌。他什么也不做，只是满怀爱意和幸福地望着她，也不觉得眼睛累。他们就这样一直坐着。十一点钟的时候，老巫婆给所有人施了魔法。大家都睡着了，与此同时，姑娘逃了出去。他们一直酣睡到了十一点四十五分。这时魔力消失了，大家都醒了过来。王子喊道：“噢，太倒霉了！这下我完了！”王子忠诚的手下也开始悲叹起来，可顺风耳却说：“安静点，让我听听。”他听了一会儿，说道：“她在一个山洞里，离这有三百里格，她正为自己的命运痛苦呢。高个子，只有你才能帮她了。你要是站直了，几步路就走到那里。”高个子答道：“好的，但是眼光犀利的朋友要和我一同去，那样我们才能让岩石裂开。”于是，高个子背起用绷带蒙着眼睛的朋友，一眨眼的功夫就来到被施了魔法的岩石前。高个子立即摘去了伙伴的蒙眼绷带，他只是四处看了看，岩石就裂成了碎块。高个子抱起姑娘，转眼间就把她送了回来。他又同样迅速地带回了他的同伴。十二点之前他们又都像以前一样坐着，个个都很高兴。当十二点的钟声敲响时，老巫婆溜了进来，她满脸都是恶毒的神情，好像在说：“现在他任由我处置了！”因为她以为女儿还在三百里格外的山洞里呢。可是，当她看到女儿还在王子的怀里时，她非常害怕，说道：“这个人懂的比我多！”她不敢再反对，迫不得已把女儿嫁给了王子。但是，她悄悄在女儿耳边说道：“你没能选择一个自己心爱的丈夫，却要服从一个平民，真是不光彩啊。”听到这话，高傲的公主满腔愤怒，她计划着要报复。第二天早上，公主命人堆集起三百大捆木柴，对王子说，虽然他已经完成了那三个任务，可她还不能嫁给他，除非有一个人甘愿坐在柴火中间忍受大火。她心想，没有哪个手下会愿意代替王子被焚烧。出于对她的爱，王子会坐上去，那样她就自由了。但手下们却说：“除了那位不怕热的朋友之外，我们都出了份力，轮到他出场了。”他们把他放到柴堆上，并点起了火。大火燃烧起来，烧了三天才烧完了所有的柴火。火焰熄灭时，那位朋友站在灰烬里，颤抖得像一片白杨树叶，他说：“我一辈子都没有感到这么冷过。要是再烧一会儿的话，我就要冻得失去知觉了。”漂亮的姑娘再也找不到借口，只得嫁给这位陌生的年轻人。可是，他们赶往教堂成婚时，老巫婆却说：“我受不了这耻辱。”她派士兵去追杀他们，并下令杀死所有敌对者，把她女儿带回来。可顺风耳已竖起耳朵，听到了老巫婆下的密令。他对胖子说：“我们该怎么办呢？”胖子有办法。他向马车后面吐了一两口先前喝过的海水，一片大海立马出现了。士兵都被困在里面淹死了。老巫婆得知这一情况后，又派去了他的铁甲骑兵。顺风耳听到铁甲的碰撞声，他解开了眼光犀利的朋友的蒙眼绷带，那人死死盯住敌人的队伍看了一会儿，铁甲像玻璃一样，瞬间都变成了碎片。这时王子和公主才能安心地继续赶路，当他们在教堂举行完婚礼后，那六位手下便向王子告辞。他们对主人说：“现在你已经完成了自己的心愿，不再需要我们了。我们要接着旅行，看看有没有好运气。”在距离王子父亲的宫殿半里格远的地方，有一个小村庄，一位养猪人正在照看猪群。他们走到那里的时候，王子对妻子说：“你知道我是谁吗？我不是王子，而是一个养猪的，那边那个照看猪群的人就是我父亲。咱俩也要开始干活了，得帮他喂猪。”然后，王子领着她来到一家小客栈，还悄悄告诉店主，让店主在夜里拿走她的漂亮衣物。结果，她第二天早上起床时，什么穿的也没有了。店主的妻子给了她一件旧衣服，还有一双破长袜。店主妻子摆出的那副神情好像是给了她多大的礼物似的，说：“要不是看在你丈夫的面子上，我才不会给你这些东西呢！”公主相信他的确是个养猪的，和他一起照看着猪群。她暗自想：“我以前那么傲慢，沦落到这个地步也活该。”公主喂猪喂了一个星期，她终于忍受不住了，脚都磨破了。这时进来了几个人，问她知不知道她丈夫是谁。她回答说：“我知道，他是一个养猪的，刚出去做绳线的买卖了。”那几个人说：“跟我们走吧，我们带你到他那里去。”他们把她带进王宫。公主进去时，她丈夫正站在那里，穿着华丽的衣服。可是，直到他抱住她、亲吻她的时候，公主才认出她的丈夫。她丈夫说：“我为你经历了很多磨难，现在你也为我吃了那么多苦。”随后，他们举行了婚礼。讲述这个故事的人希望自己也能受邀参加他们的婚礼。","And now the King’s son and his six servants came to the town where the aged Queen dwelt.He did not tell her who he was, but said, “If you will give me your beautiful daughter, I will perform any task you set me.”The sorceress was delighted to get such a handsome youth as this into her net, and said, “I will set thee three tasks, and if thou art able to perform them all, thou shalt be husband and master of my daughter.”“What is the first to be?”“Thou shalt fetch me my ring which I have dropped into the Red Sea.”So the King’s son went home to his servants and said, “The first task is not easy.A ring is to be got out of the Red Sea.Come, find some way of doing it.”Then the man with the sharp sight said, “I will see where it is lying,” and looked down into the water and said, “It is sticking there, on a pointed stone.”The Tall One carried them thither, and said, “I would soon get it out, if I could only see it.”“Oh, is that all!” cried the Stout One, and lay down and put his mouth to the water, on which all the waves fell into it just as if it had been a whirlpool, and he drank up the whole sea till it was as dry as a meadow.The Tall One stooped down a little, and brought out the ring with his hand.Then the King’s son rejoiced when he had the ring, and took it to the old Queen.She was astonished, and said, “Yes, it is the right ring.Thou hast safely performed the first task, but now comes the second.Dost thou see the meadow in front of my palace?Three hundred fat oxen are feeding there, and these must thou eat, skin, hair, bones, horns and all, and down below in my cellar lie three hundred casks of wine, and these thou must drink up as well, and if one hair of the oxen, or one little drop of the wine is left, thy life will be forfeited to me.”“May I invite no guests to this repast?” inquired the prince, “no dinner is good without some company.”The old woman laughed maliciously, and replied, “Thou mayst invite one for the sake of companionship, but no more.”The King’s son went to his servants and said to the Stout One, “Thou shalt be my guest today, and shalt eat thy fill.”Hereupon the Stout One stretched himself out and ate the three hundred oxen without leaving one single hair, and then he asked if he was to have nothing but his breakfast.He drank the wine straight from the casks without feeling any need of a glass, and he licked the last drop from his finger-nails.When the meal was over, the prince went to the old woman, and told her that the second task also was performed.She wondered at this and said, “No one has ever done so much before, but one task still remains,” and she thought to herself, “Thou shalt not escape me, and wilt not keep thy head on thy shoulders!This night,” said she, “I will bring my daughter to thee in thy chamber, and thou shalt put thine arms round her, but when you are sitting there together, beware of falling asleep.When twelve o’clock is striking, I will come, and if she is then no longer in thine arms, thou art lost.”The prince thought, “The task is easy, I will most certainly keep my eyes open.”Nevertheless he called his servants, told them what the old woman had said, and remarked, “Who knows what treachery lurks behind this?Foresight is a good thing keep watch, and take care that the maiden does not go out of my room again.”When night fell, the old woman came with her daughter, and gave her into the princes’s arms, and then the Tall One wound himself round the two in a circle, and the Stout One placed himself by the door, so that no living creature could enter.There the two sat, and the maiden spake never a word, but the moon shone through the window on her face, and the prince could behold her wondrous beauty.He did nothing but gaze at her, and was filled with love and happiness, and his eyes never felt weary.This lasted until eleven o’clock, when the old woman cast such a spell over all of them that they fell asleep, and at the self-same moment the maiden was carried away.Then they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve, when the magic lost its power, and all awoke again.“Oh, misery and misfortune!” cried the prince, “now I am lost!”The faithful servants also began to lament, but the Listener said, “Be quiet, I want to listen.”Then he listened for an instant and said, “She is on a rock, three hundred leagues from hence, bewailing her fate.Thou alone, Tall One, canst help her; if thou wilt stand up, thou wilt be there in a couple of steps.”“Yes,” answered the Tall One, “but the one with the sharp eyes must go with me, that we may destroy the rock.”Then the Tall One took the one with bandaged eyes on his back, and in the twinkling of an eye they were on the enchanted rock.The Tall One immediately took the bandage from the other’s eyes, and he did but look round, and the rock shivered into a thousand pieces.Then the Tall One took the maiden in his arms, carried her back in a second, then fetched his companion with the same rapidity, and before it struck twelve they were all sitting as they had sat before, quite merrily and happily.When twelve struck, the aged sorceress came stealing in with a malicious face, which seemed to say, “Now he is mine!” for she believed that her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off.But when she saw her in the prince’s arms, she was alarmed, and said, “Here is one who knows more than I do!”She dared not make any opposition, and was forced to give him her daughter.But she whispered in her ear, “It is a disgrace to thee to have to obey common people, and that thou art not allowed to choose a husband to thine own liking.”On this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger, and she meditated revenge.Next morning she caused three hundred great bundles of wood to be got together, and said to the prince that though the three tasks were performed, she would still not be his wife until some one was ready to seat himself in the midst of the wood, and bear the fire.She thought that none of his servants would let themselves be burnt for him, and that out of love for her, he himself would place himself upon it, and then she would be free.But the servants said, “Every one of us has done something except the Frosty One, he must set to work,” and they put him in the middle of the pile, and set fire to it.Then the fire began to burn, and burnt for three days until all the wood was consumed, and when the flames had burnt out, the Frosty One was standing amid the ashes, trembling like an aspen leaf, and saying, “I never felt such a frost during the whole course of my life; if it had lasted much longer, I should have been benumbed!”As no other pretext was to be found, the beautiful maiden was now forced to take the unknown youth as a husband.But when they drove away to church, the old woman said, “I cannot endure the disgrace,” and sent her warriors after them with orders to cut down all who opposed them, and bring back her daughter.But the Listener had sharpened his ears, and heard the secret discourse of the old woman.“What shall we do?” said he to the Stout One.But he knew what to do, and spat out once or twice behind the carriage some of the sea-water which he had drunk, and a great sea arose in which the warriors were caught and drowned.When the sorceress perceived that, she sent her mailed knights; but the Listener heard the rattling of their armour, and undid the bandage from one eye of Sharp-eyes, who looked for a while rather fixedly at the enemy’s troops, on which they all sprang to pieces like glass.Then the youth and the maiden went on their way undisturbed, and when the two had been blessed in church, the six servants took leave, and said to their master, “Your wishes are now satisfied, you need us no longer, we will go our way and seek our fortunes.”Half a league from the palace of the prince’s father was a village near which a swineherd tended his herd, and when they came thither the prince said to his wife, “Do you know who I really am?I am no prince, but a herder of swine, and the man who is there with that herd, is my father.We two shall have to set to work also, and help him.”Then he alighted with her at the inn, and secretly told the innkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night.So when she awoke in the morning, she had nothing to put on, and the innkeeper’s wife gave her an old gown and a pair of worsted stockings, and at the same time seemed to consider it a great present, and said, “If it were not for the sake of your husband I should have given you nothing at all!”Then the princess believed that he really was a swineherd, and tended the herd with him, and thought to herself, “I have deserved this for my haughtiness and pride.”This lasted for a week, and then she could endure it no longer, for she had sores on her feet.And now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was.“Yes,” she answered, “he is a swineherd, and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive a little bargain.”But they said, “Just come with us, and we will take you to him,” and they took her up to the palace, and when she entered the hall, there stood her husband in kingly raiment.But she did not recognize him until he took her in his arms, kissed her, and said, “I suffered much for thee and now thou, too, hast had to suffer for me.”And then the wedding was celebrated, and he who has told you all this, wishes that he, too, had been present at it."
"六只天鹅","The Six Swans"
"很久很久以前，有位国王在一个大森林里打猎，他那么急切地追赶着一只野兽，随从们都被抛在了后面。夜幕降临，他停下来四处张望，这时他才意识到自己迷路了。他试图寻找一条出去的路，可怎样也找不到。这时，他看到一位老妇人朝他走来，老妇人不断地点头，她其实是个女巫。国王对她说：“老太太，你能告诉我怎么走出森林吗？”她答道：“噢，好的，国王陛下，我肯定能做到，但我有个条件，要是你不答应的话，你就永远走不出森林，直到饿死在这里。”国王问道：“什么条件？”女巫说：“我有个女儿，长得很漂亮，肯定配得上你，你要是能让她当皇后的话，我就告诉你怎么走出森林。”尽管国王心里很痛苦，但他还是同意了。女巫将国王带到她的小屋里，她的女儿正坐在火旁取暖。她起身欢迎国王的到来，好像等待了很久一样。国王觉得她的确很美，可还是不称他的心意，一看到她就有种恐惧感。国王把女孩抱到马上后，女巫才指给他出去的路。国王再次回到王宫后就和女孩结婚了。国王曾经结过一次婚，前妻给他生了七个孩子，六个男孩一个女孩，他爱自己的孩子胜过世界上的一切。他担心继母对孩子们不好，甚至会伤害他们，便把他们送到森林深处一座宫殿里居住。宫殿的位置非常隐蔽，通往宫殿的路也很难找，若不是一个女星相家送给他一个神奇的线团，连国王自己也找不到。每当国王把线团扔在面前时，线团就会自动散开，给国王指引方向。国王如此频繁地去看望孩子们，王后发现国王经常不在宫中。她很好奇，想弄清楚国王到底一个人到森林里去做什么。她重金贿赂国王的随从，随从们便把秘密告诉了她，包括那个能指路的神秘线团。王后再也安不下心来，直到她找到了国王藏起来的那个线团。后来，她用丝绸做了几件白衬衫，把从母亲那里学到的巫术也缝到了里面。有一天，国王外出打猎，她便拿出小衬衫，让线团领路，走进了森林。孩子们远远地看到有人来了，都以为是他们亲爱的父亲来看他们了，满心欢喜地跑去迎接他。这时，王后朝每个孩子扔了一件衬衫，孩子们一碰到衬衫，就纷纷化作天鹅，从森林里飞走了。王后很高兴地回家了，心想她终于摆脱了这些孩子，但女孩并没有和她的哥哥们一起跑出来迎接，王后对此一无所知。国王第二天又来看他的孩子们，可他只见到了女儿。国王问她：“你的哥哥们呢？”她答道：“哎呀，亲爱的父王，他们都飞走了，就剩下我一个人！”女孩告诉国王，她从小窗户里看到哥哥们变成天鹅飞过森林，她把他们掉在院子里的羽毛捡了起来，拿给父亲看。国王很痛心，可他完全没想到这是王后做的。他害怕会失去女儿，便想把女儿带在身边。但女孩害怕她的继母，便恳求父亲让他再在森林的宫殿里呆最后一晚。可怜的女孩心想：“我不能再住在这里了。我要去寻找我的哥哥们。”天黑以后，她便向森林里跑去。她走了一整夜，第二天也一直不停地走，直到累得再也走不动了。这时，她看到一个猎人的小屋，就走了进去。她看到屋里摆着六张小床，可她又不敢到床上去，于是钻到了一张床底下，躺在硬硬的地上，打算就这样过一夜。太阳要下山时，她听到一阵沙沙声，接着就看到六只天鹅从窗外飞了进来。它们落地后互相吹气，把所有的羽毛都吹掉了，天鹅皮就像衬衫一样脱落了。女孩看着它们，认出是哥哥们，女孩很高兴，从床底下爬了出来。哥哥们看到妹妹后也同样高兴，可只过了一小会儿，他们的兴奋劲儿就消失了。他们对她说：“你不能呆在这里。”“这是强盗的地方，要是他们回来发现了你，会杀了你的。”妹妹问道：“你们难道不能保护我吗？”他们回答说：“不，我们每晚只有十五分钟的时间脱去羽毛，恢复人形。之后，我们就又变回天鹅了。”妹妹哭泣着说：“难道你们不能摆脱魔法吗？”他们答道：“唉，不行，条件太苛刻了！你要在六年间既不说也不笑，同时还要用紫菀给我们缝制六件衬衫。一旦你开口，所有的努力就都白费了。”哥哥们说完这些话，十五分钟的期限也到了，他们又变成天鹅，向窗外飞去。然而，女孩下定决心要救她的哥哥们，哪怕是付出生命。她离开小屋，走到森林里，坐在树上过了一夜。第二天早上，她去采摘紫菀，开始缝制衬衣。她不能和任何人说话，而且她也不想笑。她坐在那里，除了手中的工作，什么也不看。过了很长时间，当地的国王去森林里狩猎，猎人们来到了女孩坐着的树前。他们朝女孩喊道：“你是谁？”女孩默不作声。他们又说：“你下来吧。”“我们绝不会伤害你的。”她只是摇了摇头。他们又继续问问题，女孩便把她的金项链扔给他们，心想这下他们该满足了。然而，他们还是不罢休，她便把腰带扔了下去，可这仍不管用，女孩又把袜带扔了下去，渐渐地，女孩扔掉了身上所有能扔的东西，最后只剩下衬衣了。但是，猎人们不肯就此离去，他们爬到树上抱下女孩，把她带到国王面前。国王问道：“你是谁？你在树上做什么呢？”她还是不回答。他用自己懂得的所有语言又把这个问题问了一遍，女孩依旧默不作声。女孩很美丽，国王动心了，对她产生了浓浓爱意。国王为她披上自己的斗篷，又把她抱到马上，让她坐在自己身前，带着女孩去了王宫。然后，他命人给女孩换上华丽的衣服。女孩就如同明亮的阳光一般光彩照人，但她还是一言不发。国王把她拉到桌旁，坐在自己身边，女孩优雅得体的举止让国王很是称心，他说：“她就是那个我要娶的人，我不会再爱别的女人了。”几天后，他们便结婚了。然而，国王有位心肠邪恶的母亲，她对这桩婚姻很不满意，到处说王后的坏话。她说：“谁知道这个不会说话的女人是哪儿来的呢？她配不上国王！”一年后，王后生下了第一个孩子。老太婆偷偷带走孩子，还趁王后熟睡时往她的嘴唇上抹了些鲜血。然后，她到国王那去诬陷王后，说王后是个食人的妖怪。国王并不相信，也不允许任何人伤害王后。然而，王后还是继续缝制衬衣，对其他事情全然不管不问。后来，王后又生了一个漂亮的男孩，可恶的老太婆又故技重施，可国王仍旧不相信她的话。他说：“她那么纯洁善良，不会做那种事情的。她是个哑巴，不能为自己辩护，否则，她就能证明自己的清白。”王后生下了第三个孩子，老太婆又偷走了婴儿，然后诬陷王后。王后没有为自己辩护，国王也只好把她送去审判。王后被判火刑。行刑那天正好是她六年中不能说不能笑的最后一天。她亲爱的哥哥们已经摆脱了巫术，重获自由。除了第六套的左袖子还没做好，六套衬衫基本都做好了。当她被押上邢台时，她手里还拿着那六套衬衫。她站到高处，大火正要被点燃。她四处张望了一下，看到空中有六只天鹅朝她飞来。她知道自己就要获救了，心兴奋得怦怦直跳。天鹅纷纷落在她身边，以便她能把衬衫扔过去。天鹅一碰到衬衫，就立即就脱去羽毛，恢复了先前的模样，个个都既精神又英俊。只有最小的哥哥左臂还是天鹅的翅膀。他们彼此拥抱亲吻，国王也深受感动。王后走过去，对王国说：“亲爱的夫君，现在我终于可以说话了。我要告诉你，我是无辜的，是被冤枉的。”于是，王后向国王讲述了婆婆的伎俩，告诉他是婆婆偷走了三个孩子，并把他们藏了起来。三个孩子都找到了，国王很高兴。那个邪恶的老太婆也受到了惩罚，被押上火刑架，烧成了灰。从此，国王和王后以及她的六个哥哥，一起快乐平静地生活了很多年。","Once upon a time, a certain King was hunting in a great forest, and he chased a wild beast so eagerly that none of his attendants could follow him.When evening drew near he stopped and looked around him, and then he saw that he had lost his way.He sought a way out, but could find none.Then he perceived an aged woman with a head which nodded perpetually, who came towards him, but she was a witch.“Good woman,” said he to her, “Can you not show me the way through the forest?”“Oh, yes, Lord King,” she answered, “that I certainly can, but on one condition, and if you do not fulfil that, you will never get out of the forest, and will die of hunger in it.”“What kind of condition is it?” asked the King.“I have a daughter,” said the old woman, “who is as beautiful as any one in the world, and well deserves to be your consort, and if you will make her your Queen, I will show you the way out of the forest.”In the anguish of his heart the King consented, and the old woman led him to her little hut, where her daughter was sitting by the fire.She received the King as if she had been expecting him, and he saw that she was very beautiful, but still she did not please him, and he could not look at her without secret horror.After he had taken the maiden up on his horse, the old woman showed him the way, and the King reached his royal palace again, where the wedding was celebrated.The King had already been married once, and had by his first wife, seven children, six boys and a girl, whom he loved better than anything else in the world.As he now feared that the stepmother might not treat them well, and even do them some injury, he took them to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest.It lay so concealed, and the way was so difficult to find that he himself would not have found it, if a wise woman had not given him a ball of yarn with wonderful properties.When he threw it down before him, it unrolled itself and showed him his path.The King, however, went so frequently away to his dear children that the Queen observed his absence; she was curious and wanted to know what he did when he was quite alone in the forest.She gave a great deal of money to his servants, and they betrayed the secret to her, and told her likewise of the ball which alone could point out the way.And now she knew no rest until she had learnt where the King kept the ball of yarn, and then she made little shirts of white silk, and as she had learnt the art of witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a charm inside them.And once when the King had ridden forth to hunt, she took the little shirts and went into the forest, and the ball showed her the way.The children, who saw from a distance that some one was approaching, thought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of joy, ran to meet him.Then she threw one of the little shirts over each of them, and no sooner had the shirts touched their bodies than they were changed into swans, and flew away over the forest.The Queen went home quite delighted, and thought she had got rid of her step-children, but the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the Queen knew nothing about her.Next day the King went to visit his children, but he found no one but the little girl.“Where are thy brothers?’ asked the King.“Alas, dear father,” she answered, “they have gone away and left me alone!” and she told him that she had seen from her little window how her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers, which they had let fall in the courtyard, and which she had picked up.The King mourned, but he did not think that the Queen had done this wicked deed, and as he feared that the girl would also be stolen away from him, he wanted to take her away with him.But she was afraid of her stepmother, and entreated the King to let her stay just this one night more in the forest castle.The poor girl thought, “I can no longer stay here.I will go and seek my brothers.”And when night came, she ran away, and went straight into the forest.She walked the whole night long, and next day also without stopping, until she could go no farther for weariness.Then she saw a forest-hut, and went into it, and found a room with six little beds, but she did not venture to get into one of them, but crept under one, and lay down on the hard ground, intending to pass the night there.Just before sunset, however, she heard a rustling, and saw six swans come flying in at the window.They alighted on the ground and blew at each other, and blew all the feathers off, and their swan’s skins stripped off like a shirt.Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed.The brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was of short duration.“Here canst thou not abide,” they said to her.“This is a shelter for robbers, if they come home and find thee, they will kill thee.”“But can you not protect me?” asked the little sister.“No,” they replied, “only for one quarter of an hour each evening can we lay aside our swan’s skins and have during that time our human form; after that, we are once more turned into swans.”The little sister wept and said, “Can you not be set free?”“Alas, no,” they answered, “the conditions are too hard!For six years thou mayst neither speak nor laugh, and in that time thou must sew together six little shirts of starwort for us.And if one single word falls from thy lips, all thy work will be lost.”And when the brothers had said this, the quarter of an hour was over, and they flew out of the window again as swans.The maiden, however, firmly resolved to deliver her brothers, even if it should cost her life.She left the hut, went into the midst of the forest, seated herself on a tree, and there passed the night.Next morning she went out and gathered starwort and began to sew.She could not speak to any one, and she had no inclination to laugh; she sat there and looked at nothing but her work.When she had already spent a long time there it came to pass that the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen came to the tree on which the maiden was sitting.They called to her and said, “Who art thou?”But she made no answer.“Come down to us,” said they.“We will not do thee any harm.”She only shook her head.As they pressed her further with questions she threw her golden necklace down to them, and thought to content them thus.They, however, did not cease, and then she threw her girdle down to them, and as this also was to no purpose, her garters, and by degrees everything that she had on that she could do without until she had nothing left but her shift.The huntsmen, however, did not let themselves be turned aside by that, but climbed the tree and fetched the maiden down and led her before the King.The King asked, “Who art thou?What art thou doing on the tree?”But she did not answer.He put the question in every language that he knew, but she remained as mute as a fish.As she was so beautiful, the King’s heart was touched, and he was smitten with a great love for her.He put his mantle on her, took her before him on his horse, and carried her to his castle.Then he caused her to be dressed in rich garments, and she shone in her beauty like bright daylight, but no word could be drawn from her.He placed her by his side at table, and her modest bearing and courtesy pleased him so much that he said, “She is the one whom I wish to marry, and no other woman in the world.”And after some days he united himself to her.The King, however, had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young Queen.“Who knows,” said she, “from whence the creature who can’t speak, comes?She is not worthy of a king!”After a year had passed, when the Queen brought her first child into the world, the old woman took it away from her, and smeared her mouth with blood as she slept.Then she went to the King and accused the Queen of being a man-eater.The King would not believe it, and would not suffer any one to do her any injury.She, however, sat continually sewing at the shirts, and cared for nothing else.The next time, when she again bore a beautiful boy, the false step-mother used the same treachery, but the King could not bring himself to give credit to her words.He said, “She is too pious and good to do anything of that kind; if she were not dumb, and could defend herself, her innocence would come to light.”But when the old woman stole away the newly-born child for the third time, and accused the Queen, who did not utter one word of defence, the King could do no otherwise than deliver her over to justice, and she was sentenced to suffer death by fire.When the day came for the sentence to be executed, it was the last day of the six years during which she was not to speak or laugh, and she had delivered her dear brothers from the power of the enchantment.The six shirts were ready, only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting.When, therefore, she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her arm, and when she stood on high and the fire was just going to be lighted, she looked around and six swans came flying through the air towards her.Then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart leapt with joy.The swans swept towards her and sank down so that she could throw the shirts over them, and as they were touched by them, their swan’s skins fell off, and her brothers stood in their own bodily form before her, and were vigorous and handsome.The youngest only lacked his left arm, and had in the place of it a swan’s wing on his shoulder.They embraced and kissed each other, and the Queen went to the King, who was greatly moved, and she began to speak and said, “Dearest husband, now I may speak and declare to thee that I am innocent, and falsely accused.”And she told him of the treachery of the old woman who had taken away her three children and hidden them.Then to the great joy of the King they were brought thither, and as a punishment, the wicked stepmother was bound to the stake, and burnt to ashes.But the King and the Queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace."
"三个军医","The Three Army-Surgeons"
"有三个自以为很懂医术的军医环游世界，他们来到了一家小旅馆，打算在那里过夜。那个店主问他们从哪里来，要到哪里去？“我们在环游世界，行医济世。”“那就给我展现一下你们的技艺吧。”店主说。第一个军医说他可以砍掉自己的手，然后在第二天早晨接上；第二个军医说，他可以把自己的心挖出来，第二天早上再放回去；第三个军医说他可以挖掉自己的眼睛，再在第二天早晨治愈。“如果你们可以做到那些，”店主说，“你们的医术就十分精湛了。”原来，他们有一种药膏，把药膏涂在受伤的地方，就能把受伤的部分连起来。他们把药膏装在一个小瓶子里，随身携带。然后，他们像之前所说的那样砍掉手、挖出心，掏出眼睛，然后将它们都放在一个盘子里，给了旅店老板。旅店老板把盘子给了一个女仆，女仆将把它放在橱柜里并负责好好保存它们。然而，这个女孩有一个秘密的恋人，是个士兵。当旅店老板和三个军医以及房间里其他人都睡着时，那个士兵来了，想吃点东西。女孩打开橱柜，拿了些食物给他，她沉浸在爱恋中，竟忘了关橱柜的门。她和恋人坐在桌子旁边，聊起了天。女孩惬意地坐在那里，根本没想到会有厄运到来。猫悄悄潜入，发现橱柜的门是开的，就叼着三个军医的手、心脏和眼睛跑了。士兵吃完之后，女孩收拾好东西、准备关上橱柜的门时，发现旅店老板让她保存的盘子空了。她惊恐地告诉她的恋人：“啊，我太命苦了，我该怎么办呢？手、心脏和眼睛都不见了，明早我怎么交差呢？”“别担心，”她的恋人说，“我会帮你摆脱困境的。有个小偷在绞刑架上吊着呢，我去把他的手砍下来。哪只手呢？”“右手。”女孩给了他一把锋利的刀。他去砍掉了那个可怜的犯人的右手，交给了女孩。之后，他又抓住一只猫，挖出了它的眼睛，现在就只差心脏了。“你们不是刚杀了几头猪放在地下室了吗？”他问到。“嗯，是啊！”女孩回答到。“那太好了。”士兵说，他去了地窖，取了一头猪的心脏回来。女孩把所有的东西放在盘子里，又把盘子放进了橱柜里。做完这一切之后，她的恋人就离开了，她静静地上床睡觉去了。","Three army-surgeons who thought they knew their art perfectly, were travelling about the world, and they came to an inn where they wanted to pass the night.The host asked whence they came, and whither they were going?“We are roaming about the world and practising our art.”“Just show me for once in a way what you can do,” said the host.Then the first said he would cut off his hand, and put it on again early next morning; the second said he would tear out his heart, and replace it next morning; the third said he would cut out his eyes and heal them again next morning.“If you can do that,” said the innkeeper, “you have learnt everything.”They, however, had a salve, with which they rubbed themselves, which joined parts together, and they carried the little bottle in which it was, constantly with them.Then they cut the hand, heart and eyes from their bodies as they had said they would, and laid them all together on a plate, and gave it to the innkeeper.The innkeeper gave it to a servant who was to set it in the cupboard, and take good care of it.The girl, however, had a lover in secret, who was a soldier.When therefore the innkeeper, the three army-surgeons, and everyone else in the house were asleep, the soldier came and wanted something to eat.The girl opened the cupboard and brought him some food, and in her love forgot to shut the cupboard-door again; She seated herself at the table by her lover, and they chattered away together.While she sat so contentedly there, thinking of no ill luck, the cat came creeping in, found the cupboard open, took the hand and heart and eyes of the three army-surgeons, and ran off with them.When the soldier had done eating, and the girl was taking away the things and going to shut the cupboard she saw that the plate which the innkeeper had given her to take care of, was empty.Then she said in a fright to her lover, “Ah, miserable girl, what shall I do?The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what will become of me in the morning?”“Be easy,” said he, “I will help thee out of thy trouble there is a thief hanging outside on the gallows, I will cut off his hand.Which hand was it?”“The right one.”Then the girl gave him a sharp knife, and he went and cut the poor sinner’s right hand off, and brought it to her.After this he caught the cat and cut its eyes out, and now nothing but the heart was wanting.“Have you not been killing, and are not the dead pigs in the cellar?” said he.“Yes,” said the girl.“That’s well,” said the soldier, and he went down and fetched a pig’s heart.The girl placed all together on the plate, and put it in the cupboard, and when after this her lover took leave of her, she went quietly to bed."
"清晨，三个军医起床后，让女孩把盛有手、心脏和眼睛的盘子拿出来。女孩把盘子从橱柜里取了出来。第一个军医把药膏涂在小偷的手上，再把手放在自己的手臂上，手立即长在了手臂上。第二个军医把猫的眼睛放在了自己的脸上。第三个军医把猪的心脏固定在自己的胸膛里。旅店老板站在旁边很是钦佩他们的技艺，并说他从来没有见过这样的事。他逢人便夸赞他们的技艺。之后，三个军医付了账，又继续前行。","In the morning when the three army-surgeons got up, they told the girl she was to bring them the plate on which the hand, heart, and eyes were lying.Then she brought it out of the cupboard, and the first fixed the thief’s hand on and smeared it with his salve, and it grew to his arm directly.The second took the cat’s eyes and put them in his own head.The third fixed the pig’s heart firm in the place where his own had been, and the innkeeper stood by, admired their skill, and said he had never yet seen such a thing as that done, and would sing their praises and recommend them to everyone.Then they paid their bill, and travelled farther."
"前行的途中，装有猪的心脏的军医并不和另外两个军医一起，而是哪里有角落他就跑向哪里，像猪一样用鼻子探寻角落。另外两个人不管怎么拉他的衣服，也不顶用。他总是挣开，跑到那最脏的地方去。第二个军医的行为也很奇怪，他总是揉着眼睛，对其他的人说：“朋友们，我这是怎么了？我什么都看不到呢。你们能不能拉着我，别让我跌倒了。”就这样，他们三个人非常困难地往前走，直到傍晚，才到了另一家旅馆。刚一进大厅，就看到有一个有钱人正坐在角落的饭桌边数钱呢。安有小偷手的军医在富人旁边转悠，两次用手臂突然动了一下，最后在那有钱人转身的时候，他把手伸到钱堆里去，抓了一大笔钱。有一个军医看见了，问他：“老兄，你在干嘛呢？你不能偷东西，这多么可耻啊！”“嗯，”他说，“可是我控制不住自己啊？我的手抖个不停，虽然我的心不想偷，可我的手不听从指挥。”","As they were on their way, the one with the pig’s heart did not stay with them at all, but wherever there was a corner he ran to it, and rooted about in it with his nose as pigs do.The others wanted to hold him back by the tail of his coat, but that did no good; he tore himself loose, and ran wherever the dirt was thickest.The second also behaved very strangely; he rubbed his eyes, and said to the others, “Comrades, what is the matter?I don’t see at all.Will one of you lead me, so that I do not fall.”Then with difficulty they travelled on till evening, when they reached another inn.They went into the bar together, and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money.The one with the thief’s hand walked round about him, made a sudden movement twice with his arm, and at last when the stranger turned away, he snatched at the pile of money, and took a handful from it.One of them saw this, and said, “Comrade, what art thou about?Thou must not steal shame on thee!”“Eh,” said he, “but how can I stop myself?My hand twitches, and I am forced to snatch things whether I will or not.”"
"后来他们去睡觉了。那时候天已经漆黑了，伸手不见五指。突然，有猫眼睛的军医醒了，他叫醒其他的人，说：“伙计们，快看啊！有好多老鼠在那里乱跑呢，看见了吗？”两个军医坐起来，却什么也没看见。有猫眼睛的军医说：“不对，我们没有拿回自己的东西。我们必须回去找那个旅店老板，他欺骗了我们。”于是，他们第二天一早就赶回那个旅馆，告诉老板，他们没有拿到自己的手、眼睛和心脏：第一个军医拿到的是小偷的手，第二个军医拿到的是猫的眼睛，第三个军医拿到的是猪的心脏。老板说，这一定是女佣的错。于是，他想把她叫过来。但是女佣人一看到他们三人回来，就从后门逃跑了，再也没有回来。于是，那三个军医说除非旅店老板给他们很多钱，否则他们就放火烧了他的房子。旅店老板交出了他所有的钱，三个军医带着这些钱离开了。尽管这些钱已经足够他们下半生的生活，但是他们宁愿要回属于自己的器官。","After this, they lay down to sleep, and while they were lying there it was so dark that no one could see his own hand.All at once the one with the cat’s eyes awoke, aroused the others, and said.“Brothers, just look up, do you see the white mice running about there?”The two sat up, but could see nothing.Then said he, “Things are not right with us, we have not got back again what is ours.We must return to the innkeeper, he has deceived us.”They went back therefore, the next morning, and told the host they had not got what was their own again; that the first had a thief’s hand, the second cat’s eyes, and the third a pig’s heart.The innkeeper said that the girl must be to blame for that, and was going to call her, but when she had seen the three coming, she had run out by the backdoor, and not come back.Then the three said he must give them a great deal of money, or they would set his house on fire.He gave them what he had, and whatever he could get together, and the three went away with it.It was enough for the rest of their lives, but they would rather have had their own proper organs."
"十二王子","The Twelve Brothers"
"很久很久以前，有一对生活幸福的国王和王后，他们膝下有十二个孩子，可都是男孩。于是，国王对王后说：“如果你生下的第十三个孩子是个女孩的话，我就把十二个儿子都杀掉，那样我们的财产就都是女儿的了，日后也由她来继承王位。”他命人做了十二副一样的棺材，在里面装满了锯末，还各放上一个供死人用的枕头，然后把它们锁进了密室里。国王把密室钥匙交给王后，告诫她不要跟任何人提及此事。可是，王后自那以后便每日唉声叹气。她参照《圣经》给自己的小儿子取名叫本杰明，一天，这个总是陪伴着她的小儿子问道：“亲爱的妈妈，你为什么总是这么难过呢？”王后答道：“我最爱的孩子啊，我不能告诉你。”可是，小王子一直缠着王后不放，王后便打开了密室的门，指给他看那十二副装满锯末的棺材。王后说道：“我最爱的本杰明啊，你父王命人为你和你的十一个哥哥做了这十二副棺材。因为，如果我生下一个女孩的话，他就要处死你们，把你们放到这些棺材里。”王后边哭边说，小王子安慰她道：“不要哭了，亲爱的妈妈，我们会有办法逃走保住性命的。”可王后却说：“和你的十一个哥哥逃往森林里去吧，其中一人坐到你们能找到的最高树上看守着，要注视着王宫里的灯塔。要是我生下的是个男孩，就会挂起一面白旗，那样你们就再回来；可我要是生下了女孩，就在塔上挂起一面红旗，那样的话你们能逃多快就逃多快，愿上帝保佑你们。我每个晚上都会起来为你们祈祷——冬天时，愿你们有火堆取暖；夏天时，愿你们不会中暑。”","There were once on a time a king and a queen who lived happily together and had twelve children, but they were all boys.Then said the King to his wife, “If the thirteenth child which thou art about to bring into the world, is a girl, the twelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great, and that the kingdom may fall to her alone.”He caused likewise twelve coffins to be made, which were already filled with shavings, and in each lay the little pillow for the dead, and he had them taken into a locked up room, and then he gave the Queen the key of it, and bade her not to speak of this to any one.The mother, however, now sat and lamented all day long, until the youngest son, who was always with her, and whom she had named Benjamin, from the Bible, said to her, “Dear mother, why art thou so sad?”“Dearest child,” she answered, “I may not tell thee.”But he let her have no rest until she went and unlocked the room, and showed him the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings.Then she said,  “my dearest Benjamin, thy father has had these coffins made for thee and for thy eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into the world, you are all to be killed and buried in them.”And as she wept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, “Weep not, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence.”But she said, “Go forth into the forest with thy eleven brothers, and let one sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep watch, looking towards the tower here in the castle.If I give birth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may venture to come back, but if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red flag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the good God protect you.And every night I will rise up and pray for you—in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and in summer that you may not faint away in the heat.”"
"王后为儿子们祈祷后，十二王子便逃进森林里了。他们轮流坐在一棵最高的橡树上观察着王宫的灯塔。十一天过去后，轮到本杰明看守了，他看到灯塔上面挂起了一面旗。可是，那不是白旗，而是宣告他们要被处死的红旗。哥哥们知道后，非常气愤，说道：“我们难道真要因为一个女婴而遭受死亡的厄运吗？我们发誓要给自己报仇！以后不管在哪儿，遇到一个女孩，我们就要杀了她。”","After she had blessed her sons therefore, they went forth into the forest.They each kept watch in turn, and sat on the highest oak and looked towards the tower.When eleven days had passed and the turn came to Benjamin, he saw that a flag was being raised.It was, however, not the white, but the blood-red flag which announced that they were all to die.When the brothers heard that, they were very angry and said, “Are we all to suffer death for the sake of a girl?We swear that we will avenge ourselves!—wheresoever we find a girl, her red blood shall flow.”"
"于是，十二王子逃到森林深处去了，在森林里最幽暗的地方，他们看到一个被施了魔法的小空房子。他们说道：“我们就住在这里吧，本杰明，你是年龄最小的，身体也最虚弱，你就负责呆在家里看门吧，我们出去找点吃的。”于是，哥哥们去了森林里，他们猎杀野兔、野鹿、鸟儿、鸽子，还有其他可以吃的东西。他们把猎物交给本杰明，本杰明只得煮好，让大家得以果腹。十二王子在小房子里一住就是十年，倒也不觉得时间太难熬。","Thereupon they went deeper into the forest, and in the midst of it, where it was the darkest, they found a little bewitched hut, which was standing empty.Then said they, “Here we will dwell, and thou Benjamin, who art the youngest and weakest, thou shalt stay at home and keep house, we others will go out and get food.”Then they went into the forest and shot hares, wild deer, birds and pigeons, and whatsoever there was to eat; this they took to Benjamin, who had to dress it for them in order that they might appease their hunger.They lived together ten years in the little hut, and the time did not appear long to them."
"王后生下的女孩现在也已长大了，她既善良又漂亮，额头前还长着一颗金色的星星。一次，小公主在一大堆洗过的衣服中间看到了十二件男式衬衫，她便问王后：“这十二件衬衫是谁的呢？父王可穿不上这么小的衣服呀。”于是，王后难过地答道：“亲爱的孩子啊，这些衬衫是你的十二个哥哥的。”小公主问：“我的十二个哥哥在哪儿呢？我从来没听说过他们呀。”王后回答说：“只有上帝才知道他们现在在哪里呀，他们在世界上到处流浪呢。”王后打开密室，指给小公主看那十二副装着锯末和枕头的棺材。她说：“这些棺材是为你的哥哥们准备的，不过他们在你出生之前悄悄逃走了。”王后向小公主讲述了一切。小公主听后，说道：“亲爱的妈妈，不要哭，我要去找我的哥哥们。”","The little daughter which their mother the Queen had given birth to, was now grown up; she was good of heart, and fair of face, and had a golden star on her forehead.Once, when it was the great washing, she saw twelve men’s shirts among the things, and asked her mother, “To whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far too small for father?”Then the Queen answered with a heavy heart, “Dear child, these belong to thy twelve brothers.”Said the maiden, “Where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard of them?”She replied, “God knows where they are, they are wandering about the world.”Then she took the maiden and opened the chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the shavings, and pillows for the head.“These coffins,” said she, “were destined for thy brothers, but they went away secretly before thou wert born,” and she related to her how everything had happened; then said the maiden, “Dear mother, weep not, I will go and seek my brothers.”"
"于是，她带上十二件衬衫出发了，直接走进了森林里。她走了一整天，夜幕降临时，小公主来到了那座被施了魔法的小房子。她走进去，看到一个少年，少年问她：“你从哪里来，要到哪里去呢？”女孩非常漂亮，穿着华丽的衣裳，额头前还有一颗金星，这让少年十分惊讶。女孩答道：“我是一个国王的女儿，要去寻找我的十二个哥哥。哪怕要走到天涯海角，我也要找到他们。”她说完便拿出哥哥们十二件衬衫给少年看。本杰明知道她就是自己的妹妹，说道：“我是本杰明，你最小的哥哥。”女孩兴奋地哭起来，本杰明也忍不住流出泪水，他们充满爱意地相拥亲吻。后来，本杰明说：“亲爱的妹妹，我们还有一件困难的事。我们曾发誓要杀掉我们遇到的每一个少女，因为我们是为了一个女孩的缘故而被迫离家的。”女孩说：“如果这样能救了我的十二个哥哥，我宁愿死。”本杰明答道：“不，你不能死，你躲到桶下等哥哥们回来吧，我很快会和他们商量好的。”","So she took the twelve shirts and went forth, and straight into the great forest.She walked the whole day, and in the evening she came to the bewitched hut.Then she entered it and found a young boy, who asked, “From whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?” and was astonished that she was so beautiful, and wore royal garments, and had a star on her forehead.And she answered, “I am a king’s daughter, and am seeking my twelve brothers, and I will walk as far as the sky is blue until I find them.”She likewise showed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.Then Benjamin saw that she was his sister, and said, “I am Benjamin, thy youngest brother.”And she began to weep for joy, and Benjamin wept also, and they kissed and embraced each other with the greatest love.But after this he said, “Dear sister, there is still one difficulty.We have agreed that every maiden whom we meet shall die, because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on account of a girl.”Then said she, “I will willingly die, if by so doing I can deliver my twelve brothers.”“No,” answered he, “thou shalt not die, seat thyself beneath this tub until our eleven brothers come, and then I will soon come to an agreement with them.”"
"小公主照做了，到了晚上，哥哥们打猎回来了，晚饭也已准备好了。他们都围桌坐下开始用餐了，问道：“今天有什么新鲜事吗？”本杰明说：“你们难道没什么新鲜事吗？”他们答道：“没有。”本杰明继续说道：“你们到森林里打猎，我呆在家里，可我知道的事情可比你们多啊。”哥哥们喊道：“那就快告诉我们吧。”他答道：“但你们要答应我，不处死我们遇到的第一个少女。”他们又喊道：“好吧，我们放过她，你快讲吧。”","She did so, and when it was night the others came from hunting, and their dinner was ready.And as they were sitting at table, and eating, they asked, “What news is there?”Said Benjamin, “Don’t you know anything?”“No,” they answered.He continued, “You have been in the forest and I have stayed at home, and yet I know more than you do.”“Tell us then,” they cried.He answered, “But promise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed.”“Yes,” they all cried, “she shall have mercy, only do tell us.”"
"于是，本杰明说：“我们的妹妹到这里来了。”他提起桶，小公主从下面钻了出来，她穿着华丽的衣裳，额头上长着一颗金星，是那么的美丽、温柔。他们都很高兴，搂着她的脖子亲吻着，从心底里疼爱她。此后，小公主便呆在家里帮本杰明做家务。其他十一个哥哥到森林里去打猎，他们能抓来野味、各种鸟儿还有林鸽等当食物，小公主和本杰明就负责做饭。小公主拾柴火、采野菜，她把锅放到火堆上，总是在哥哥们回来时就已准备好饭菜。她还把房间打扫得整整齐齐，在小床上铺上洁白漂亮的床单，哥哥们十分满意，和她和睦地相处。","Then said he, “Our sister is here,” and he lifted up the tub, and the King’s daughter came forth in her royal garments with the golden star on her forehead, and she was beautiful, delicate and fair.Then they were all rejoiced, and fell on her neck, and kissed and loved her with all their hearts.Now she stayed at home with Benjamin and helped him with the work.The eleven went into the forest and caught game, and deer, and birds, and wood pigeons that they might have food, and the little sister and Benjamin took care to make it ready for them.She sought for the wood for cooking and herbs for vegetables, and put the pans on the fire so that the dinner was always ready when the eleven came.She likewise kept order in the little house, and put beautifully white clean coverings on the little beds, and the brothers were always contented and lived in great harmony with her."
"有一次，小公主和本杰明在家里准备了一桌丰盛的晚餐，哥哥们回来后便坐下，高兴地大吃大喝起来。这座被施了魔法的小房子附近还有一个小花园，小花园里长着十二朵百合花，又叫做“冬生百合”。小公主想让哥哥们高兴，便采下了这十二朵百合花，她心想，她可以在哥哥们吃饭时送给他们每人一朵。可就在她采下这些花的同时，她的哥哥们忽然变成十二只乌鸦飞出了森林，这座小房子和小花园也随之一起消失了。可怜的小公主被独自留在了森林里，她四下张望，看到一位老太太正站在她身边，老太太说：“我的孩子，你都干了些什么呀？你为什么不让那十二朵花继续生长了啊？它们就是你的哥哥们，以后却只能永远做乌鸦了。”小公主哭起来，问道：“就没有办法救他们了吗？”老太太回答说：“没有，世界上只有一个办法可以救他们，但这太难了你办不到的。因为你在七年的时间里既不能说话也不能笑。一旦你张口说一个字，哪怕只差一小时就到七年了，你所有的努力也都将付之东流，你的哥哥们也会因你说出的这一个字而死。”小公主听后，坚定地说：“我一定要救哥哥们。”她找到一棵高树坐上去纺线，不说话也不笑。一天，碰巧一个国王到森林里打猎，他有一条大猎狗，猎狗跑到小公主坐着的树下，围着大树跳来跳去，还朝小公主吠个不停。之后，国王来到树下，他看到额头长着金星的漂亮小公主，被她的美丽所倾倒，便问小公主是否愿意嫁给他。小公主没做声，但却微微点了点头。因此，国王亲自爬到树上，把她抱下来放到马背上，带着小公主一起回宫了。宫中举行了隆重的婚礼，可新娘却还是既不说也不笑。他们一起幸福地生活了几年，可国王的母亲是个心肠狠毒的人，她开始中伤年轻的王后了，便对国王说：“你娶进门的是个普通的要饭女。谁知道她背地里耍什么鬼把戏呢！就算她是个哑巴不能说话，可她也该笑一笑啊，那些从不笑的人一定都没安好心。”国王起初并不相信她的话，可她不停地怂恿国王，说王后干过很多坏事，最后国王也被说服了，便赐死王后。","Once on a time the two at home had prepared a beautiful entertainment, and when they were all together, they sat down and ate and drank and were full of gladness.There was, however, a little garden belonging to the bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily flowers, which are likewise called students.She wished to give her brothers pleasure, and plucked the twelve flowers, and thought she would present each brother with one while at dinner.But at the self-same moment that she plucked the flowers the twelve brothers were changed into twelve ravens, and flew away over the forest, and the house and garden vanished likewise.And now the poor maiden was alone in the wild forest, and when she looked around, an old woman was standing near her who said, “My child, what hast thou done?Why didst thou not leave the twelve white flowers growing?They were thy brothers, who are now for evermore changed into ravens.”The maiden said, weeping, “Is there no way of delivering them?”“No,” said the woman, “there is but one in the whole world, and that is so hard that thou wilt not deliver them by it, for thou must be dumb for seven years, and mayst not speak or laugh, and if thou speakest one single word, and only an hour of the seven years is wanting, all is in vain, and thy brothers will be killed by the one word.”Then said the maiden in her heart, “I know with certainty that I shall set my brothers free,” and went and sought a high tree and seated herself in it and span, and neither spoke nor laughed.Now it so happened that a king was hunting in the forest, who had a great greyhound which ran to the tree on which the maiden was sitting, and sprang about it, whining, and barking at her.Then the King came by and saw the beautiful King’s daughter with the golden star on her brow, and was so charmed with her beauty that he called to ask her if she would be his wife.She made no answer, but nodded a little with her head.So he climbed up the tree himself, carried her down, placed her on his horse, and bore her home.Then the wedding was solemnized with great magnificence and rejoicing, but the bride neither spoke nor smiled.When they had lived happily together for a few years, the King’s mother, who was a wicked woman, began to slander the young Queen, and said to the King, “This is a common beggar girl whom thou hast brought back with thee.Who knows what impious tricks she practises secretly!Even if she be dumb, and not able to speak, she still might laugh for once; but those who do not laugh have bad consciences.”At first the King would not believe it, but the old woman urged this so long, and accused her of so many evil things, that at last the King let himself be persuaded and sentenced her to death."
"皇宫大院里生起了一堆大火，王后要在这里被烧死了，国王站在窗前看着，满眼泪花，因为他依然深爱着王后。当王后被紧紧绑在柱子上，大火的红舌开始舔舐她的衣裳，七年的时间终于到了。空中忽然传来一阵呱呱声，十二只乌鸦朝着这里飞过来，它们纷纷落下来，脚一着地就变成了王后的十二个哥哥，王后终于救了他们。他们拨开火堆扑灭了大火，把妹妹救了出来，亲吻、拥抱她。此时，王后能够张口说话了，她告诉国王为什么自己不能说话不能笑。了解到王后是无辜的之后，国王很是高兴，他们从此一生都过着幸福的生活。那位狠毒的后母则被带去问罪，她被扔到一口装满热油和毒蛇的大桶里，悲惨地死去了。","And now a great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she was to be burnt, and the King stood above at the window and looked on with tearful eyes, because he still loved her so much.And when she was bound fast to the stake, and the fire was licking at her clothes with its red tongue, the last instant of the seven years expired.Then a whirring sound was heard in the air, and twelve ravens came flying towards the place, and sank downwards, and when they touched the earth they were her twelve brothers, whom she had delivered.They tore the fire asunder, extinguished the flames, set their dear sister free, and kissed and embraced her.And now as she dared to open her mouth and speak, she told the King why she had been dumb, and had never laughed.The King rejoiced when he heard that she was innocent, and they all lived in great unity until their death.The wicked step-mother was taken before the judge, and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous snakes, and died an evil death."
"十二个猎户","The Twelve Huntsmen"
"从前有一个王子，他与他深爱的少女订了婚。然而，有一次，就在他高高兴兴地坐在那个少女身边时，传来了他父王病危的噩耗，他父王想在临终前再见他一面。于是他对心爱的少女说：“我现在必须离开你回去见父王了，我把这枚戒指给你作为信物。等我当了国王，就回来接你。”于是他骑着马飞奔而去，等他赶到父王身边时，国王已经病入膏肓、奄奄一息了。国王对他说：“亲爱的儿子，我想在死前再见你一面。请你答应我按照我的意愿结婚。”国王指明让他娶一位公主。王子十分悲痛，不假思索地答应道：“好的，亲爱的父王，我会遵从您的意愿去做的。”就在那时国王闭上了眼睛，仙逝了。","There was once a King’s son who was betrothed to a maiden whom he loved very much.And when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.Then he said to his beloved, “I must now go and leave thee, I give thee a ring as a remembrance of me.When I am King, I will return and fetch thee.”So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death.He said to him, “Dear son, I wished to see thee once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,” and he named a certain King’s daughter who was to be his wife.The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said, “Yes, dear father, your will shall be done,” and thereupon the King shut his eyes, and died."
"后来，王子继承了王位。过了他父王的悼念期之后，他便不得不履行自己对父王的承诺。于是他向那个公主提了亲，那个公主也答应了。已与他订婚的那个女孩听说了这件事，为他的不忠伤心至极，差点死掉。她父亲问她：“亲爱的孩儿，你为何如此伤心呢？你想要什么，我都会给你。”她想了想，回答道：“亲爱的父亲，我想要十一个和我无论是脸蛋、体型还是身高，都一模一样的女孩。”她父亲说道：“如果可能的话，我会帮你满足这个愿望的。”于是，他派人到全国各地去找，直到找到了十一个和他女儿脸蛋、体型和身高都完全一致的女孩。","When therefore the son had been proclaimed King, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the King’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was promised to him.His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithlessness that she nearly died.Then her father said to her, “Dearest child, why art thou so sad?Thou shalt have whatsoever thou wilt.”She thought for a moment and said, “Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.”The father said, “If it be possible, thy desire shall be fulfilled,” and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size."
"等她们来到这位公主跟前时，她已经找人做好了十二套相同的猎装。她命令她们穿上猎装，她自己也穿上了一套。然后她离开了自己的父亲，和那十一个女孩骑马远去，来到了她先前的未婚夫、那个她深爱着的男人的宫殿前。她问他是否需要猎人，能否让她们十二个都为他服务。国王看了看她，并没有认出她来。她们都是那么的俊俏，他便答道：“可以。”他愿意收留她们，从此她们就成了这个国王的十二个猎人了。","When they came to the King’s daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.Thereupon she took leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.Then she inquired if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take the whole of them into his service.The King looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said, “Yes,” and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the King’s twelve huntsmen."
"可是，这个国王有一头狮子，有着非凡的能力：它能识破所有隐藏的和秘密的事情。一天晚上，他对那国王说：“您真以为您有十二个猎人吗？”“是的，”国王说道，“他们是十二个猎人。”狮子接着说道：“您错啦，她们是十二个女孩。”国王说：“不可能啊！你能证明给我看吗？”“噢，只要在门廊上撒些豌豆，”狮子回答道，“然后您很快就会知道真相了。男人的步伐稳健，他们走到了豌豆上时不会打滑。但是女孩走路轻巧，还会拖着脚走，豌豆就会到处乱滚。”国王非常满意，于是命人在门廊上撒了豌豆。","The King, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things.It came to pass that one evening he said to the King, “Thou thinkest thou hast twelve huntsmen?”“Yes,” said the King, “they are twelve huntsmen.”The lion continued, “Thou art mistaken, they are twelve girls.”The King said, “That cannot be true!How wilt thou prove that to me?”“Oh, just let some peas be strewn in thy ante-chamber,” answered the lion, “and then thou wilt soon see it.Men have a firm step, and when they walk over the peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.”The King was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn."
"但是国王的一个仆人跟猎人们很要好，当他听说要考验她们时，就把一切都告诉了她们，并说道：“那头狮子想向国王证明你们是女孩。”然后公主很感激，对其他女孩说：“你们要鼓足力气，步伐稳健地踏过豌豆。”第二天早上，国王差人召唤十二个猎人到他面前。他们踏进了撒有豌豆的门廊时，走得如此坚定有力，以至于豌豆既没有滚动也没有挪动一下。她们离开后，国王便对狮子厉声道：“你骗了我，他们走得跟男人一样。”狮子说：“他们之前知道了自己将要经受测验，假装很有力量。哪天就在门廊里放十二台纺车，她们一定会走上前去并且十分开心，而那是任何一个男人都不会做的。”国王很喜欢这个建议，就在门廊里放了十二台纺车。","There was, however, a servant of the King’s who favored the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said, “The lion wants to make the King believe that you are girls.”Then the King’s daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens, “Put on some strength, and step firmly on the peas.”So next morning when the King had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred.Then they went away again, and the King said to the lion, “Thou hast lied to me, they walk just like men.”The lion said, “They have got to know that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength.Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber some day, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.”The King liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber."
"但是那个仆人又跑去告诉了她们这个计划。等只剩下她们的时候，公主对她的十一个女孩说：“你们要克制住自己，不要一直看那些纺车。”第二天早上，国王又召集那十二个猎人。她们走过门廊时，看都没看那些纺车。于是国王呵斥狮子道：“你欺骗了我，他们是男人，因为他们看都没看纺车一眼。”狮子回答说：“她们已经知道要被测验，所以克制了自己。”然而国王再也不相信那头狮子了。","But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and disclosed the project.Then when they were alone the King’s daughter said to her eleven girls, “Put some constraint on yourselves, and do not look round at the spinning-wheels.”And next morning when the King had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning wheels.Then the King again said to the lion, “Thou hast deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.”The lion replied, “They have learnt that they were going to be put to the test, and have restrained themselves.”The King, however, would no longer believe the lion."
"十二个猎人经常跟随国王狩猎，国王对她们的喜爱与日俱增。后来有一次，在他们正外出打猎的时候，有消息说国王的未婚妻要来了。那个真正的未婚妻听了这消息心碎欲绝，晕在地上不省人事了。国王心想，他心爱的猎人一定是发生了什么事，便跑上前去想要帮帮他，结果把她的手套拉掉了。他看到了那枚给他第一个未婚妻的戒指，他再看看她的脸庞，便认出了她。他的心被深深地触动了，便吻了她，她睁开眼时对他说：“你是我的，我是你的，世界上没有人可以改变这些。”国王便派了一个信使去另一个未婚妻那里，乞求她回到自己的王国，因为他已经有一个妻子了。一个人要是已经有了一盘菜，是不再需要一盘新菜的。他们随即举办了婚礼，而那头狮子也再度被宠信了，因为毕竟，之前他说的都是实话。","The twelve huntsmen always followed the King to the chase, and his liking for them continually increased.Now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting, news came that the King’s betrothed was approaching.When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground.The King thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off.Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he recognized her.Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said, “Thou art mine, and I am thine, and no one in the world can alter that.”He sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and a man who had just found an old dish did not require a new one.Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth."
"十二个懒长工","The Twelve Idle Servants"
"有十二个懒长工，白天不努力干活，晚上更是什么都不做，每天只是躺在草坪上，各自吹嘘自己是如何的懒惰。第一个说：“你们的懒惰对我来说算什么？我有我自己的懒法。首先，我得养好身体，我吃的不少，喝的更多。我每天吃四顿饭，间隔期间我什么也不吃，等又饿了我才吃，那样胃口特别好。我从不早起，快到中午的时候，我就已经找好了休息的地方了。如果东家叫我，我完全当没听见，如果他叫了第二次，我还要磨蹭一会儿才起身，慢腾腾地去找他。这样的生活还算凑合。”","Twelve servants who had done nothing all the day would not exert themselves at night either, but laid themselves on the grass and boasted of their idleness.The first said, “What is your laziness to me, I have to concern myself about mine own?The care of my body is my principal work, I eat not a little and drink still more.When I have had four meals, I fast a short time until I feel hunger again, and that suits me best.To rise betimes is not for me; when it is getting near mid—day, I already seek out a resting-place for myself.If the master call, I do exactly as if I had not heard him, and if he call for the second time, I wait awhile before I get up, and go to him very slowly.In this way life is endurable.”"
"第二个说：“我需要照看一匹马，可我老用马嚼子塞住它的嘴，不高兴就根本不喂它，但会和东家说，它已经吃过啦。我自己呢，则躺进燕麦堆里睡了四个钟头。睡醒了之后，我伸出一只脚在马身上蹭几下，这样就算给马梳洗过了。谁会花心思在那上面啊？更何况对我来说，这工作太麻烦了。”","The second said, “I have a horse to look after, but I leave the bit in his mouth, and if I do not want to do it, I give him no food, and I say he has had it already.I, however, lay myself in the oat-chest and sleep for four hours.After this I stretch out one foot and move it a couple of times over the horse’s body, and then he is combed and cleaned.Who is going to make a great business of that?Nevertheless service is too toilsome for me.”"
"第三个说：“为什么要辛苦自己干活儿呢？一点意思都没有！我躺在阳光下，开始睡觉。天开始下起小雨了，但我为什么要起来呢？上帝保佑，就让雨下吧。最后雨下大了，下得噼里啪啦，竟然打断了我的头发冲走了，还在头上留下了一块大疤，我贴了一块药膏在上面，就不管它了。我已经有好几处这样的伤疤了。”","The third said, “Why plague oneself with work?Nothing comes of it!I laid myself in the sun, and fell asleep.It began to rain a little, but why should I get up?I let it rain on in God’s name.At last came a splashing shower, so heavy indeed, that it pulled the hair out of my head and washed it away, and I got a hole in the skull; I put a plaster on it, and then it was all right.I have already had several injuries of that kind.”"
"第四个说：“如果我要我干一样活儿，我首先要拖一个小时，以养足精力。然后我才慢悠悠地动身，问一问有没有帮手。如有帮手，我就把主要的活儿给他们干，自己只在一旁瞧着。要知道，这对我来说还是太难了。”","The fourth said, “If I am to undertake a piece of work, I first loiter about for an hour that I may save up my strength.After that I begin quite slowly, and ask if no one is there who could help me.Then I let him do the chief of the work, and in reality only look on; but that also is still too much for me.”"
"第五个说：“这算什么呀！你们想想，我要给马厩除粪，还有把粪装上马车。我慢条斯理地做，要是粪耙上有东西了，就叉起一点点，只抬到一半高的地方就先休息一刻钟，才扔到车上去。就算我一天装满一车，也还会剩下许多。我才不会拼死拼活地干呢。”","The fifth said, “What does that matter?Just think, I am to take away the manure from the horse’s stable, and load the cart with it.I let it go on slowly, and if I have taken anything on the fork, I only half-raise it up, and then I rest just a quarter of an hour until I quite throw it in.It is enough and to spare if I take out a cartful in the day.I have no fancy for killing myself with work.”"
"第六个说：“真为你们感到羞耻，我才不怕干活呢，但是我睡三星期觉都懒得脱一次衣服。系鞋带有什么用呢？鞋要掉就让它掉吧，有什么关系呢。如果我要上楼，一只脚迈上第一个台阶后，我再慢慢抬另一只脚。然后数数还剩多少台阶，这样我就能知道我得在哪儿休息。”","The sixth said, “Shame on ye; I am afraid of no work, but I lie down for three weeks, and never once take my clothes off.What is the use of buckling your shoes on?For aught I care they may fall off my feet, it is no matter.If I am going up some steps, I drag one foot slowly after the other on to the first step, and then I count the rest of them that I may know where I must rest."
"第七个说：“我可不能这样，我东家要在旁边盯着我干活，除非他一整天都不在家。但我什么都不耽误，别人爬的时候，我却在尽可能地跑。要想让我向前走，非得要四个大汉用尽他们的力气推我才行。我去的地方，一张木板床上并排躺着六个人睡觉。我依然能挤在他们身边睡觉。我一睡着就再叫不醒。要是他们想让我回家，就得抬我。”","The seventh said, “That will not do with me; my master looks after my work, only he is not at home the whole day.But I neglect nothing, I run as fast as it is possible to do when one crawls.If I am to get on, four sturdy men must push me with all their might.I came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other.I lay down by them and slept too.There was no wakening me again, and when they wanted to have me home, they had to carry me.”"
"第八个说：“看来就我还算是个最爱动的人了。如果有一块石头在我面前，我才不会麻烦地抬腿跨过去。我就躺在地上，如果身上湿了还沾上了泥土，我就一直躺在那里，直到太阳出来把身上晒干。最多我就翻个身，好让太阳晒着我。”","The eighth said, “I see plainly that I am the only active fellow; if a stone lie before me, I do not give myself the trouble to raise my legs and step over it.I lay myself down on the ground, and if I am wet and covered with mud and dirt, I stay lying until the sun has dried me again.At the very most, I only turn myself so that it can shine on me.”"
"第九个说：“这算得了什么！今天面包就放在我面前，但我懒得去吃它，差点饿死了！而且边上还有只水壶，但我嫌它太大太重了，不想提起它，我宁肯渴着。对我来说，翻身都太困难了，我一整天就想根木头一样躺着。”","The ninth said, “That is the right way!To-day the bread was before me, but I was too idle to take it, and nearly died of hunger!Moreover a jug stood by it, but it was so big and heavy that I did not like to lift it up, and preferred bearing thirst.Just to turn myself round was too much for me, I remained lying like a log the whole day.”"
"第十个说：“懒惰给我带来了不幸，一条腿断了，另一条小腿也肿了。我们有三个人躺在路上，我伸着我的腿。有个人驾着辆马车过来了，轮子从我身上碾了过去。也许，我的确应该收回腿，但是我真没听到马车过来了，因为蚊虫在我耳边嗡嗡地叫，从我鼻子爬进去，又从我嘴里跑出来，谁愿意惹麻烦把这虫子赶走呢？”","The tenth said, “Laziness has brought misfortune on me, a broken leg and swollen calf.Three of us were lying in the road, and I had my legs stretched out.Some one came with a cart, and the wheels went over me.I might indeed have drawn my legs back, but I did not hear the cart coming, for the midges were humming about my ears, and creeping in at my nose and out again at my mouth; who can take the trouble to drive the vermin away?”"
"第十一个说：“我昨天就辞工不干了。我才没兴趣给东家把那厚重的书搬来搬去的。整天干都干不完。但说句实话，是东家辞退了我，他不愿意再雇用我了，因为我让他的衣服蒙上了灰，让蛀虫咬得稀烂，但这事让我很高兴。”","The eleventh said, “I gave up my place yesterday.I had no fancy for carrying the heavy books to my master any longer or fetching them away again.There was no end of it all day long.But to tell the truth, he gave me my dismissal, and would not keep me any longer, for his clothes, which I had left lying in the dust, were all moth-eaten, and I am very glad of it.”"
"第十二个说：“今天派我赶车去地里，可我自己在车上铺了点草，美美地睡了一觉。当我醒了的时候，缰绳已经从我手里挣掉了，马儿也已经扯松了，马具丢了，拴马用的绳子也不见了，项圈、马缰和马嚼子都不见了。有人路过，把这些都捡走了。而且，马车很快又陷在一块沼泽里卡住了。我就让它停在原地，自己照样躺在稻草上。最后东家自己过来，把马车拖了上来，要是他不来，我就不会在这里，而是在沼泽里，安稳地睡觉呢。”","The twelfth said, “To-day I had to drive the cart into the country, and made myself a bed of straw on it, and had a good sleep.The reins slipped out of my hand, and when I awoke, the horse had nearly torn itself loose, the harness was gone, the strap which fastened the horse to the shafts was gone, and so were the collar, the bridle and bit.Some one had come by, who had carried all off.Besides this, the cart had got into a quagmire and stuck fast.I left it standing, and stretched myself on the straw again.At last the master came himself, and pushed the cart out, and if he had not come I should not be lying here but there, and sleeping in full tranquillity.”"
"两个国王的孩子","The Two Kings’ Children"
"很久很久以前，有一个国王，他有一位小王子，小王子被预言在十六岁的时候会被牡鹿杀死。当他长到十六岁后，有一次和几个猎人同去打猎。王子在森林里和其他猎人走散了，他忽然看到一只大牡鹿，便想要射它，却失手了。最后，他追逐着牡鹿跑了很远，跑出了森林。这时牡鹿忽然不见了，一个大个头的巨人站在了他的面前，说道：“太好了，我找到你了。我为了追赶你已经跑坏了六双玻璃溜冰鞋，却一直没能赶上你。”然后，他带走了王子，拖着他渡过了一个大湖，来到一座宏伟的宫殿。在那宫殿里，王子不得不坐在桌前同他一起用餐。吃过之后，国王说道：“我有三个女儿，你得守护我的大女儿一晚，也就是从晚上九点一直守护到早上六点，每次钟响的时候，我会亲自来叫你，你要是没应声，明早我就会处死你，但是，你如果每次都回应的话，就可以娶我的大女儿为妻了。”","There was once on a time a King who had a little boy of whom it had been foretold that he should be killed by a stag when he was sixteen years of age, and when he had reached that age the huntsmen once went hunting with him.In the forest, the King’s son was separated from the others, and all at once he saw a great stag which he wanted to shoot, but could not hit.At length he chased the stag so far that they were quite out of the forest, and then suddenly a great tall man was standing there instead of the stag, and said, “It is well that I have thee.I have already ruined six pairs of glass skates with running after thee, and have not been able to get thee.”Then he took the King’s son with him, and dragged him through a great lake to a great palace, and then he had to sit down to table with him and eat something.When they had eaten something together the King said, “I have three daughters, thou must keep watch over the eldest for one night, from nine in the evening till six in the morning, and every time the clock strikes, I will come myself and call, and if thou then givest me no answer, tomorrow morning thou shall be put to death, but if thou always givest me an answer, thou shalt have her to wife.”"
"两个年轻人走进了睡房，那里立着一尊圣克里斯托弗的石像。大公主对石像说：“我的父亲会在九点钟的时候过来，之后在钟敲三点之前每小时都来一次；他来的时候，你代替王子回答一声吧。”于是，石像很快地点了点头，然后速度越来越慢，直到最后纹丝不动了。第二天早上，国王对他说：“你做得很好，可我还不能把女儿交给你。你现在得守护我的二女儿一晚，然后我会考虑你能否娶我的大女儿为妻。我会每小时亲自来一趟，我叫你的话，你要答应，若是我叫你你却没有反应的话，你就等着送命吧。”于是，他们俩走进了睡房，那里有一尊更大的圣克里斯托弗的石像。二公主对石像说：“如果我父亲来叫王子，你就代王子答应一声吧。”大石像又快速地点了点头，然后逐渐慢下来，直到最后又一动不动了。王子躺在门边上，头枕着双手睡着了。第二天早晨，国王对他说：“虽然你做得很不错，可我还是不能把女儿交给你；你得再守护小公主一晚，然后我会考虑你能否娶二公主为妻。我每小时会亲自来一趟的，我叫你的时候就回答我，如果我叫你，你却没有应声的话，你还是要送命。”","When the young folks went to the bed-room there stood a stone image of St. Christopher, and the King’s daughter said to it, “My father will come at nine o’clock, and every hour till it strikes three; when he calls, give him an answer instead of the King’s son.”Then the stone image of St. Christopher nodded its head quite quickly, and then more and more slowly till at last it stood still.The next morning the King said to him, “Thou hast done the business well, but I cannot give my daughter away.Thou must now watch a night by my second daughter, and then I will consider with myself, whether thou canst have my eldest daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee, answer me, and if I call thee and thou dost not reply, thy blood shall flow.”Then they both went into the sleeping-room, and there stood a still larger stone image of St. Christopher, and the King’s daughter said to it, “If my father calls, do you answer him.”Then the great stone image of St. Christopher again nodded its head quite quickly and then more and more slowly, until at last it stood still again.And the King’s son lay down on the threshold, put his hand under his head and slept.The next morning the King said to him, “Thou hast done the business really well, but I cannot give my daughter away; thou must now watch a night by the youngest princess, and then I will consider with myself whether thou canst have my second daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee answer me, and if I call thee and thou answerest not, thy blood shall flow for me.”"
"于是，他们又一次一起进入了睡房，那里立着一尊比前两尊更大更高的圣克里斯托弗石像。小公主对石像说：“我父亲来叫王子的时候，你就代王子答应一下吧。”大石像点头点了有半个小时，直到最后才慢慢停了下来。王子又躺在门边上睡着了。第二天早晨，国王说：“你守护得的确很好，可我现在不能把女儿交给你；我有一大片森林，要是你能在今天早六点到晚六点之间把树都砍倒的话，我会考虑一下你们的婚事。”于是国王给了他一把玻璃斧头，一把玻璃楔子和一把玻璃锤。他走到森林后，立即开始砍树，可斧头却断成了两半，他便拿起楔子，用锤头刚一敲，楔子就变得如同沙粒般大小了。于是，他不安起来，认定自己会被处死，便坐下哭了起来。","Then they once more went to the sleeping-room together, and there was a much greater and much taller image of St. Christopher than the two first had been.The King’s daughter said to it, “When my father calls, do thou answer.”Then the great tall stone image of St. Christopher nodded quite half an hour with its head, until at length the head stood still again.And the King’s son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept.The next morning the King said, “Thou hast indeed watched well, but I cannot give thee my daughter now; I have a great forest, if thou cuttest it down for me between six o’clock this morning and six at night, I will think about it.”Then he gave him a glass axe, a glass wedge, and a glass mallet.When he got into the wood, he began at once to cut, but the axe broke in two, then he took the wedge, and struck it once with the mallet, and it became as short and as small as sand.Then he was much troubled and believed he would have to die, and sat down and wept."
"到了中午时分，国王说：“你们姐妹哪个人得给他送点吃的东西去。”大公主和二公主都说：“不去，我们不去给他送饭；他最后守护的那个人才应该去。”于是，小公主被迫去给他送些吃的。她来到森林后便问他砍树砍得怎么样了。他说道：“唉，进展得很不顺利。”于是她让他过来先吃一点东西。他说：“不了，我完不成任务，反正早晚都得死，什么也不吃了。”于是小公主变得温柔起来，劝说他过来尝一尝，他这才去吃了一点东西。他吃了些东西之后，小公主说：“我给你梳会儿头发吧，你心情就会好一些的。”","Now when it was noon the King said, “One of you girls must take him something to eat.”“No,” said the two eldest, “We will not take it to him; the one by whom he last watched, can take him something.”Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat.When she got into the forest, she asked him how he was getting on?“Oh,” said he, “I am getting on very badly.”Then she said he was to come and just eat a little.“Nay,” said he, “I cannot do that, I shall still have to die, so I will eat no more.”Then she spoke so kindly to him and begged him just to try, that he came and ate something.When he had eaten something she said, “I will comb thy hair a while, and then thou wilt feel happier.”"
"小公主便给他梳起头发来。他很疲劳，一会儿就睡着了。这时小公主拿出她的手帕，打了一个结，在地上敲打了三次，并说道：“土地精灵，出来吧。”刚说完，就有很多土地精灵出现了，问公主有什么吩咐。小公主便说：“你们要在三个小时之内把森林里的树都砍倒，还要把所有的木头堆成堆。”于是小土地精灵们便四处散开去把各自的所有亲戚朋友召集起来，一起帮忙完成工作。他们立刻就动手干起来，三个小时过去了，所有的工作也完成了，他们回到小公主跟前向她报告。小公主于是又拿起她的白手帕，说道：“土地精灵，回家吧。”话音刚落，他们就都消失不见了。当王子醒来时，满心欢喜，小公主说：“六点钟的时候你就回去吧。”他照着公主的话做了，国王问他：“你把整片森林都砍倒了吗？”王子答道：“是的。”当他们绕桌坐下的时候，国王说：“我还是不能把女儿嫁给你，为了她你还要做件事情。”于是王子问是什么事。国王说：“我有一个大池塘。你明天一早就去那里，把池塘里的所有污泥都清除掉，让它如同镜子一样清澈，然后把各种各样的鱼放在里面。”第二天早晨，国王给了他一把玻璃铲，并说道：“池塘的工作必须在六点前完成。”于是他出发了。到达池塘后，他把铲子向泥浆里一插，铲子断成了两半，他只能将铲头再插进去，可是也断开了。他很难过。到了中午，小公主又给他带来一些吃的，并问他工作进展得怎么样了。王子说，所有的事情都很糟糕，他必死无疑了。“我的工具又断裂了。”她说：“噢，你还是过来吃点东西吧，那样你就会换种心情的。”他说：“不，我不吃，我实在没心情吃东西。”于是她劝了他很长时间，终于劝通他吃了一些东西。小公主又给他梳起头发来，他又睡着了。小公主便再次拿出她的手帕，打了一个结，用结在地上敲了三下，说道：“土地精灵，出来吧。”一眨眼的功夫便有很多小土地精灵出现了，问她有什么吩咐。她告诉他们在三小时之内把整个池塘清理干净，要干净到人们能在水中看到自己的倒影才行，还要在池塘里放入各种各样的鱼。小土地精灵就四处召唤亲戚朋友来帮助他们，两个小时的功夫就完成了工作。于是他们又回到公主身边，说道：“我们按你的吩咐都做好了。”小公主拿出手帕，再次在地上敲打了三下，说：“土地精灵，回家吧。”精灵们便又消失不见了。","So she combed his hair, and he became weary and fell asleep, and then she took her handkerchief and made a knot in it, and struck it three times on the earth, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth.”In a moment, numbers of little earth-men came forth, and asked what the King’s daughter commanded?Then said she, “In three hours’ time the great forest must be cut down, and the whole of the wood laid in heaps.”So the little earth-men went about and got together the whole of their kindred to help them with the work.They began at once, and when the three hours were over, all was done, and they came back to the King’s daughter and told her so.Then she took her white handkerchief again and said, “Earth-workers, go home.”On this they all disappeared.When the King’s son awoke, he was delighted, and she said, “Come home when it has struck six o’clock.”He did as she told him, and then the King asked, “Hast thou made away with the forest?”“Yes,” said the King’s son.When they were sitting at table, the King said, “I cannot yet give thee my daughter to wife, thou must still do something more for her sake.”So he asked what it was to be, then?“I have a great fish-pond,” said the King.“Thou must go to it tomorrow morning and clear it of all mud until it is as bright as a mirror, and fill it with every kind of fish.”The next morning the King gave him a glass shovel and said, “The fish-pond must be done by six o’clock.”So he went away, and when he came to the fish-pond he stuck his shovel in the mud and it broke in two, then he stuck his hoe in the mud, and broke it also.Then he was much troubled.At noon the youngest daughter brought him something to eat, and asked him how he was getting on?So the King’s son said everything was going very ill with him, and he would certainly have to lose his head.“My tools have broken to pieces again.”“Oh,” said she, “thou must just come and eat something, and then thou wilt be in another frame of mind.”“No,” said he, “I cannot eat, I am far too unhappy for that!”Then she gave him many good words until at last he came and ate something.Then she combed his hair again, and he fell asleep, so once more she took her handkerchief, tied a knot in it, and struck the ground thrice with the knot, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth.”In a moment a great many little earth-men came and asked what she desired, and she told them that in three hours’ time, they must have the fish-pond entirely cleaned out, and it must be so clear that people could see themselves reflected in it, and every kind of fish must be in it.The little earth-men went away and summoned all their kindred to help them, and in two hours it was done.Then they returned to her and said, “We have done as thou hast commanded.”The King’s daughter took the handkerchief and once more struck thrice on the ground with it, and said, “Earth-workers, go home again.”Then they all went away."
"王子醒来的时候，池塘已经清理得干干净净了。公主也该离开了，她告诉他在六点的时候回城堡去。他回去后，国王问道：“你把池塘清理干净了吗？”王子说：“是的。”“那真不错。”","When the King’s son awoke the fish-pond was done.Then the King’s daughter went away also, and told him that when it was six he was to come to the house.When he arrived at the house the King asked, “Hast thou got the fish-pond done?”“Yes,” said the King’s son.That was very good."
"当他们再次围坐在桌旁时，国王说：“尽管你把池塘也打扫干净了，可我还是不能把女儿嫁给你；你还需要做最后一件事。”王子问道：“是什么事呢？”国王说他有一座大山，山上布满荆棘，需要王子全部砍光，而且他要王子在山顶上建一座大城堡，要和人们想象得一样牢固，并且要在城堡里放好一座城堡该有的所有家具摆设。第二天早上王子醒来时，国王给了他一把玻璃斧子和一把玻璃手钻，他要在六点前完成所有的工作。他刚用斧子去砍第一株荆棘，斧子就碎了，小小的碎片飞得到处都是。同样，他也没办法用手钻干活。他非常痛苦，等待着小公主过来，看她是否能帮他解决。中午的时候她来了，给他带来一些食物。他走过去，告诉了公主这一切。吃了一些东西后，公主又为他梳头发，而他又睡着了。公主又一次拿出手帕打上结，敲敲地面，说道：“土地精灵，出来吧。”许多土地精灵立刻出现了，问公主需要他们做什么。她说：“你们要在三个小时之内砍掉所有的荆棘，再在山顶建一座城堡，人们能够想象到有多牢固，这座城堡就要有多牢固，还要在城堡里放上所有该有的家具摆设。”他们散开，又找来自己的亲友帮忙。时间到了，工作也完成了。于是他们来到公主面前，向她报告，小公主拿出手帕，在地面上敲了三下，说道：“土地精灵，回家吧。”话音刚落，精灵们又都消失得无影无踪了。因此，王子醒来后，看到所有的活儿都做完了，他高兴得如同天空中的鸟儿。","When they were again sitting at table the King said, “Thou hast certainly done the fish-pond, but I cannot give thee my daughter yet; thou must just do one thing more.”“What is that, then?” asked the King’s son.The King said he had a great mountain on which there was nothing but briars which must all be cut down, and at the top of it the youth must build up a great castle, which must be as strong as could be conceived, and all the furniture and fittings belonging to a castle must be inside it.And when he arose next morning the King gave him a glass axe and a glass gimlet with him, and he was to have all done by six o’clock.As he was cutting down the first briar with the axe, it broke off short, and so small that the pieces flew all round about, and he could not use the gimlet either.Then he was quite miserable, and waited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his need.When it was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat.He went to meet her and told her all, and ate something, and let her comb his hair and fell asleep.Then she once more took the knot and struck the earth with it, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth!”Then came once again numbers of earth-men, and asked what her desire was.Then said she, “In the space of three hours you must cut down the whole of the briars, and a castle must be built on the top of the mountain that must be as strong as any one could conceive, and all the furniture that pertains to a castle must be inside it.”They went away, and summoned their kindred to help them and when the time was come, all was ready.Then they came to the King’s daughter and told her so, and the King’s daughter took her handkerchief and struck thrice on the earth with it, and said, “Earth-workers, go home,” on which they all disappeared.When therefore the King’s son awoke and saw everything done, he was as happy as a bird in air."
"钟敲打了六下的时候，他们便一起回家了。于是国王便问道：“城堡建好了吗？”王子说：“是的。”他们围着桌子坐下后，国王说：“直到我的两个大女儿结婚了，我才能让小女儿嫁给你。”王子和小公主为此很烦恼，可王子也毫无办法。但是，他在夜里来到了公主的房间，和她一起逃走了。他们刚逃出一段距离，公主回头一看，发现她父亲就在后面。她说：“呀，我们要怎么办？我父亲要追上来了，他会把我们抓回去的。我马上把你变成荆棘吧，把自己变成玫瑰，我就在荆棘中躲起来。”国王追上的时候，那里立着一丛荆棘，荆棘中间有枝玫瑰花，于是他便要摘下那枝玫瑰，这时荆棘冒了出来，戳破了他的手指，国王只得被迫回去了。王后问他，为什么没把他们的女儿带回来呢？国王说，他就要追上他们的时候，他们忽然就不见了，地上只有一丛荆棘，中间有一支玫瑰花。","When it had struck six, they went home together.Then said the King, “Is the castle ready?”“Yes,” said the King’s son.When they sat down to table, the King said, “I cannot give away my youngest daughter until the two eldest are married.”Then the King’s son and the King’s daughter were quite troubled, and the King’s son had no idea what to do.But he went by night to the King’s daughter and ran away with her.When they had got a little distance away, the King’s daughter peeped round and saw her father behind her.“Oh,” said she, “what are we to do?My father is behind us, and will take us back with him.I will at once change thee into a briar, and myself into a rose, and I will shelter myself in the midst of the bush.”When the father reached the place, there stood a briar with one rose on it, then he was about to gather the rose, when the thorn came and pricked his finger so that he was forced to go home again.His wife asked why he had not brought their daughter back with him?So he said he had nearly got up to her, but that all at once he had lost sight of her, and a briar with one rose was growing on the spot."
"王后说道：“要是你只摘下了那支玫瑰，荆棘也一定会跟来的。”于是，他又返回去摘玫瑰，可那时他们俩人已经跑远了，国王只得再次追赶。公主又回头看，发现他父亲追来了，说：“呀，我们该怎么办？我立刻把你变成一座教堂吧，我化作一位牧师，我就站到讲道坛上去布道。”国王赶上来时，看到那里矗立着一座教堂，还有一位牧师站在讲道坛上布道。他便听了一会儿布道，又回去了。","Then said the Queen, “If thou hadst but gathered the rose, the briar would have been forced to come too.”So he went back again to fetch the rose, but in the meantime the two were already far over the plain, and the King ran after them.Then the daughter once more looked round and saw her father coming, and said, “Oh, what shall we do now?I will instantly change thee into a church and myself into a priest, and I will stand up in the pulpit, and preach.”When the King got to the place, there stood a church, and in the pulpit was a priest preaching.So he listened to the sermon, and then went home again."
"王后问他为什么还是没把女儿带回来，他答道：“唉，我追着她跑了很久，我以为自己就要赶上她的时候，面前却出现了一座教堂，还有一位牧师在讲道坛上布道。”王后说：“你该把牧师带回来啊。那么教堂也很快会跟来的。派你去真没用，我得亲自去了。”王后赶了一段时间后，能够看到远处他俩的身影了，公主回头一看，看到她母亲要追上来了，便说道：“我们现在还不能松懈，我母亲亲自赶来了；我立即把你变成一个池塘，我就变成一条鱼儿吧。”","Then the Queen asked why he had not brought their daughter with him, and he said, “Nay, I ran a long time after her, and just as I thought I should soon overtake her, a church was standing there and a priest was in the pulpit preaching.”“Thou shouldst just have brought the priest,” said his wife, “and then the church would soon have come.It is no use to send thee, I must go there myself.”When she had walked for some time, and could see the two in the distance, the King’s daughter peeped round and saw her mother coming, and said, ""Now we are undone, for my mother is coming herself: I will immediately change thee into a fish-pond and myself into a fish."""
"王后赶到这里时，面前是一口大池塘，一条鱼儿在池塘里畅游着，还向池塘边张望着，十分快活。她想要抓住那条鱼，却怎样都抓不住。她发起怒来，为了抓住那鱼喝干了整口池塘里的水，可她却为此感到非常难受，想要呕吐，最终把所有的水又吐了出来。她叫喊道：“我很清楚，现在什么也做不了。”她又劝说他们现在跟她回去。于是，小公主又回去了，王后赐给她三个胡桃，说：“带上这三个胡桃，你就能在有紧急情况的时候帮助自己了。”因此，这两个年轻人再一次一起出发了。他们走了足足十英里，来到了王子所住的城堡，城堡附近是一座小村庄。他们到达村庄后，王子说：“亲爱的，你在这儿等着我，我到城堡里去一下，然后驾着马车、带着侍从来迎接你。”","When the mother came to the place, there was a large fish-pond, and in the midst of it a fish was leaping about and peeping out of the water, and it was quite merry.She wanted to catch the fish, but she could not.Then she was very angry, and drank up the whole pond in order to catch the fish, but it made her so ill that she was forced to vomit, and vomited the whole pond out again.Then she cried, “I see very well that nothing can be done now,” and said that now they might come back to her.Then the King’s daughter went back again, and the Queen gave her daughter three walnuts, and said, “With these thou canst help thyself when thou art in thy greatest need.”So the young folks went once more away together.And when they had walked quite ten miles, they arrived at the castle from whence the King’s son came, and close by it was a village.When they reached it, the King’s son said, “Stay here, my dearest, I will just go to the castle, and then will I come with a carriage and with attendants to fetch thee.”"
"他回到城堡后，大家都为王子归来而兴奋不已，他告诉大家他的新娘现在正在村庄里等着他，并吩咐他们马上备好马车去接她。于是大家立即备好马，很多侍从都坐在了马车外。王子正要上车的时候，他的母亲吻了他一下，他忽然就忘记了发生的所有事情，也忘记了自己要去做什么。王后命人把马匹再牵回去，所有人都回到了城堡里。公主坐在村庄里不停地张望着，她心想他会回来接她的，可没人过来。于是，公主便在归城堡管辖的一个磨坊里做起了活儿，不得不每天下午坐在池塘边清洗水桶。","When he got to the castle they all rejoiced greatly at having the King’s son back again, and he told them he had a bride who was now in the village, and they must go with the carriage to fetch her.Then they harnessed the horses at once, and many attendants seated themselves outside the carriage.When the King’s son was about to get in, his mother gave him a kiss, and he forgot everything which had happened, and also what he was about to do.On this his mother ordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage again, and everyone went back into the house.But the maiden sat in the village and watched and watched, and thought he would come and fetch her, but no one came.Then the King’s daughter took service in the mill which belonged to the castle, and was obliged to sit by the pond every afternoon and clean the tubs."
"一天，王后走出城堡，沿着池塘边散步，她看到了这位长相清秀的姑娘坐在那里，说道：“这个姑娘多漂亮啊！她正合我心意啊！”于是她和所有的随从都看着这个姑娘，却没人认识她。公主诚心实意地在磨坊里做了很长时间。这段时间，王后为儿子挑选了一位妻子，她来自很遥远的一个地方。当新娘来后，他们就要立即结婚了。很多人匆忙地聚集过来，都想要看看热闹。于是公主恳请磨坊主能好心地让她也去凑凑热闹。磨坊主说：“好的，你去吧。”她正要去的时候，打开了一个胡桃，胡桃里面有一条非常漂亮的裙子。她穿上裙子走进了教堂，站在靠近祭坛的地方。这时，新郎和新娘进来了，就坐在祭坛的前面，牧师将要开始主持仪式的时候，新娘向周围稍微张望了一下，她一眼看到了站在那里的公主。于是她站起来说，除非她也有一条像那位姑娘的一样漂亮的裙子，不然她就不和王子结婚了。于是他们又回到城堡里，派人去问问公主是否能把裙子卖给他们。姑娘说不卖但是可以做个交换。于是新娘便问她要怎么做。公主说，如果她能在王子的门外睡一晚的话，新娘就可以得到她想要的东西。新娘便说：“好的，我愿意交换。”可仆人们奉命给王子喝了安眠药，公主躺在门前痛苦了一整夜。她曾帮他砍倒了整片森林，她曾帮他清理干净了池塘，她曾帮他建了一座城堡，她曾把他变作一丛荆棘，变作一座教堂，也变作过一口池塘，他却这么快地就忘掉了她。王子什么也没有听到，但仆人们却被吵醒了，并且听到了公主的话，可他们都不知道这些话是什么意思。第二天早上，他们都醒来后，新娘便穿上了那条裙子，和新郎一起去了教堂。这时，公主打开了第二个胡桃，胡桃里面有一条更为漂亮的裙子。她穿上裙子去了教堂，站在祭坛的旁边，上次发生的事又一次上演了。公主又一次躺在王子睡房的门外，仆人又奉命要给王子喝安眠药。然而，仆人这次却给了他一些保持清醒的东西，然后王子上床了。为磨坊主做工的公主像昨晚一样在门口悲叹起来，诉说着她所做的一切。这次王子都听到了，他非常难过，慢慢记起了过去的事情。于是他想到公主那里去，可他母亲却已把房门锁了起来。第二天早上，他立即去见他的心上人，告诉了她发生在自己身上的所有事情，恳求她不要因自己忘了她而生气。公主这时打开了第三个胡桃，里面是一条更加华丽的裙子，她穿上裙子，和她的新郎一起走向教堂，很多孩子都来给他们献花，在他们脚下铺起一条条的彩带，牧师也为他们祈福，婚礼的气氛十分愉悦。那位假坏王后和新娘只得离开了。最后一个讲述这个故事的人现在还活在世上呢。","And the Queen came one day on foot from the castle, and went walking by the pond, and saw the well-grown maiden sitting there, and said, “What a fine strong girl that is!She pleases me well!”Then she and all with her looked at the maid, but no one knew her.So a long time passed by during which the maiden served the miller honorably and faithfully.In the meantime, the Queen had sought a wife for her son, who came from quite a distant part of the world.When the bride came, they were at once to be married.And many people hurried together, all of whom wanted to see everything.Then the girl said to the miller that he might be so good as to give her leave to go also.So the miller said, “Yes, do go there.”When she was about to go, she opened one of the three walnuts, and a beautiful dress lay inside it.She put it on, and went into the church and stood by the altar.Suddenly came the bride and bridegroom, and seated themselves before the altar, and when the priest was just going to bless them, the bride peeped half round and saw the maiden standing there.Then she stood up again, and said she would not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that lady there.So they went back to the house again, and sent to ask the lady if she would sell that dress.No, she would not sell it, but the bride might perhaps earn it.Then the bride asked her how she was to do this?Then the maiden said if she might sleep one night outside the King’s son’s door, the bride might have what she wanted.So the bride said, “Yes, she was willing to do that.”But the servants were ordered to give the King’s son a sleeping-drink, and then the maiden laid herself down on the threshold and lamented all night long.She had had the forest cut down for him, she had had the fish-pond cleaned out for him, she had had the castle built for him, she had changed him into a briar, and then into a church, and at last into a fish-pond, and yet he had forgotten her so quickly.The King’s son did not hear one word of it, but the servants had been awakened, and had listened to it, and had not known what it could mean.The next morning when they were all up, the bride put on the dress, and went away to the church with the bridegroom.In the meantime the maiden opened the second walnut, and a still more beautiful dress was inside it.She put it on, and went and stood by the altar in the church, and everything happened as it had happened the time before.And the maiden again lay all night on the threshold which led to the chamber of the King’s son, and the servant was once more to give him a sleeping-drink.The servant, however, went to him and gave him something to keep him awake, and then the King’s son went to bed, and the miller’s maiden bemoaned herself as before on the threshold of the door, and told of all that she had done.All this the King’s son heard, and was sore troubled, and what was past came back to him.Then he wanted to go to her, but his mother had locked the door.The next morning, however, he went at once to his beloved, and told her everything which had happened to him, and prayed her not to be angry with him for having forgotten her.Then the King’s daughter opened the third walnut, and within it was a still more magnificent dress, which she put on, and went with her bridegroom to church, and numbers of children came who gave them flowers, and offered them gay ribbons to bind about their feet, and they were blessed by the priest, and had a merry wedding.But the false mother and the bride had to depart.And the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm."

"从前有一个男人，他的妻子去世了，留下了一个女儿。还有一个女人，她的丈夫去世了，也留下了一个女儿。两个女孩彼此熟悉，一次结伴出去散步，走到了那个寡妇的家中。寡妇对男人的女儿说：“你听着，回去告诉你父亲，我愿意做他的妻子，那样的话你每天早晨都可以用牛奶沐浴，喝葡萄酒解渴，而我的女儿只能用水沐浴，喝水解渴。”女孩回到家中，把寡妇的话如实告诉了父亲。男人说：“我该怎么办呢？婚姻有乐也有苦啊。”最终他还是没能作出决定，于是脱下皮靴，说道：“拿着这只靴子，靴底有一个洞。拿到阁楼上去，把它挂在大钉子上，然后往里灌上水。要是水不流出的话，我就娶她为妻；要是水流了出来，我就不再娶了。”女孩按父亲的吩咐去做了，水使靴底的皮子膨胀开来堵住了洞，水一直灌到了靴顶。她把结果告诉了父亲。于是，男人亲自上楼去看一看，他发现女儿说的真是事实，便来到寡妇家中向她求婚，于是两人结了婚。","There was once a man whose wife died, and a woman whose husband died, and the man had a daughter, and the woman also had a daughter.The girls were acquainted with each other, and went out walking together, and afterwards came to the woman in her house.Then said she to the man’s daughter, “Listen, tell thy father that I would like to marry him, and then thou shalt wash thyself in milk every morning, and drink wine, but my own daughter shall wash herself in water and drink water.”The girl went home, and told her father what the woman had said.The man said, “What shall I do?Marriage is a joy and also a torment.”At length as he could come to no decision, he pulled off his boot, and said, “Take this boot, it has a hole in the sole of it.Go with it up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into it.If it hold the water, then I will again take a wife, but if it run through, I will not.”The girl did as she was ordered, but the water drew the hole together, and the boot became full to the top.She informed her father how it had turned out.Then he himself went up, and when he saw that she was right, he went to the widow and wooed her, and the wedding was celebrated."
"第一天早上，两个女孩起床后，摆在男人女儿面前的是用来洗漱的牛奶和要喝的葡萄酒，而摆在女人女儿面前的却是洗漱用的水和要喝的水。第二天早上，两个女孩面前摆放的就都是洗漱的水和喝的水了。第三天早上，男人的女儿面前摆放着洗漱用水和喝的水，而寡妇的女儿面前摆放的却是洗漱用的牛奶和喝的葡萄酒。之后，这种情况就一直持续了下去。寡妇变得对继女十分刻薄，一日胜过一日地折磨她。因为继女既相貌美丽又惹人疼爱，而自己的女儿却不仅长相丑陋还令人讨厌，因此她心里很是妒忌。","The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the man’s daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink, but before the woman’s daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking.On the second morning, stood water for washing and water for drinking before the man’s daughter as well as before the woman’s daughter.And on the third morning stood water for washing and water for drinking before the man’s daughter, and milk for washing and wine for drinking, before the woman’s daughter, and so it continued.The woman became bitterly unkind to her step-daughter, and day by day did her best to treat her still worse.She was also envious because her step-daughter was beautiful and lovable, and her own daughter ugly and repulsive."
"寒冬里的一天，所有的东西都被冻得如同石头一样坚硬，山谷也覆盖着一层白雪，寡妇用纸做了一件衣裳，叫来继女，说道：“穿上这件衣裳，到森林去给我摘满一篮子草莓回来，我想吃了。”女孩说：“上帝啊！冬天怎么可能会长草莓呀！地上都结了冰，大雪还把万物都覆盖住了。你为什么让我穿着纸衣裳出去呀？外面冷得连呼出的气都能冻住！大风会吹透这纸衣裳的，荆棘也能将它划破。”继母说道：“你还要跟我顶嘴吗？快去，采不到一篮子草莓你就再也别回来！”然后，她塞给女孩一点硬面包，说：“这够你撑一天的了。”后母心想：“你会又饥又冷死在外面的，我再也不用看到你了。”","Once, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone, and hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock of paper, called her step-daughter, and said, “Here, put on this dress and go out into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of strawberries,—I have a fancy for some.”“Good heavens!” said the girl, “no strawberries grow in winter!The ground is frozen, and besides the snow has covered everything.And why am I to go in this paper frock?It is so cold outside that one’s very breath freezes!The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns will tear it off my body.”“Wilt thou contradict me again?” said the stepmother, “See that thou goest, and do not show thy face again until thou hast the basketful of strawberries!”Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said, “This will last thee the day,” and thought, “Thou wilt die of cold and hunger outside, and wilt never be seen again by me.”"
"于是，女孩只好屈从，她穿好纸衣裳，挎着篮子出门了。一望无际的大地上除了积雪什么都没有，连一棵青草都见不到。来到森林后，女孩看到了一座小房子，有三个小矮人正从房子里向外张望。她向小矮人们问好，然后轻轻地敲了敲门。他们喊道：“进来。”女孩走进屋里，坐到火炉旁的椅子上，边烤着火取暖边吃早饭。小矮人们说道：“也给我们分一点吃的吧。”女孩答道：“好啊。”便把那块小面包分成两半，给了小矮人一半。他们问道：“天气这么冷，你穿得这么单薄到森林里做什么呢？”女孩回答说：“唉，我要来采一篮子草莓，只有采到了草莓才能回家去。”她吃完饭后，小矮人们递给她一把扫帚，说：“去把后门的雪扫走吧。”女孩走出去后，三个小矮人商量道：“她这么善良，还同我们分享面包，我们该怎样回报她呢？”第一个小矮人说：“我要让她越来越漂亮。”第二个小矮人说：“我要让她每次张口说话，口中就会吐出一锭金子来。”第三个小矮人说：“我要让她嫁给一位国王。”","Then the maiden was obedient, and put on the paper frock, and went out with the basket.Far and wide there was nothing but snow, and not a green blade to be seen.When she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped three dwarfs.She wished them good day, and knocked modestly at the door.They cried, “Come in,” and she entered the room and seated herself on the bench by the stove, where she began to warm herself and eat her breakfast.The elves said, “Give us, too, some of it.”“Willingly,” she said, and divided her bit of bread in two and gave them the half.They asked, “What dost thou here in the forest in the winter time, in thy thin dress?”“Ah,” she answered, “I am to look for a basketful of strawberries, and am not to go home until I can take them with me.”When she had eaten her bread, they gave her a broom and said, “Sweep away the snow at the back door with it.”But when she was outside, the three little men said to each other, “What shall we give her as she is so good, and has shared her bread with us?”Then said the first, “My gift is, that she shall every day grow more beautiful.”The second said, “My gift is, that gold pieces shall fall out of her mouth every time she speaks.”The third said, “My gift is, that a king shall come and take her to wife.”"
"女孩按小矮人们的吩咐用扫帚扫走了小房子后面的积雪，她竟发现了熟透的草莓，那些暗红的草莓全从积雪下面冒了出来。女孩满心欢喜地采满了一篮子草莓，她谢过小矮人们，又和他们一一握手告别，之后就飞奔回家，把继母想要的草莓交给了她。她进门后，刚道了一声晚上好，一块金子就从她的嘴里落下来。接着，女孩讲述了她在森林中的奇遇，只是她每说一句话就会吐出一块金子，直到整间屋子都被黄金塞满了。寡妇的女儿喊道：“看看她现在多傲慢啊，竟这样把金子吐得到处都是！”其实她心中很嫉妒女孩，也想到森林中去寻找草莓。她母亲说：“不行啊，我亲爱的小女儿，外面太冷了，你会被冻死的。”可是，由于她嚷嚷着坚持要去，她母亲只得屈服了，用兽皮给她做了一件华丽的衣裳，强迫她穿上，还为她准备了黄油面包和蛋糕。","The girl, however, did as the little men had bidden her, swept away the snow behind the little house with the broom, and what did she find but real ripe strawberries, which came up quite dark-red out of the snow!In her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the little men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much.When she went in and said good-evening, a piece of gold at once fell from her mouth.Thereupon she related what had happened to her in the wood, but with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell from her mouth, until very soon the whole room was covered with them.“Now look at her arrogance,” cried the step-sister, “to throw about gold in that way!” but she was secretly envious of it, and wanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries.The mother said, “No, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, thou mightest die of cold.”However, as her daughter let her have no peace, the mother at last yielded, made her a magnificent dress of fur, which she was obliged to put on, and gave her bread-and-butter and cake with her."
"女孩走进森林里，径直来到那座小房子前。三个小矮人又在向外张望，但她根本没有问候，既不看他们也不跟他们打招呼，愣头愣脑地就走进屋去，然后靠着火炉坐下，吃起黄油面包和蛋糕来。三个小矮人说：“分给我们一点吃的吧。”可她却答道：“我自己都不够吃的呢，怎么可能分给别人？”她吃完后，小矮人们说：“给你一把扫帚，去扫扫后门外面的积雪吧。”","The girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house.The three little elves peeped out again, but she did not greet them, and without looking round at them and without speaking to them, she went awkwardly into the room, seated herself by the stove, and began to eat her bread-and-butter and cake.“Give us some of it,” cried the little men; but she replied, “There is not enough for myself, so how can I give it away to other people?”When she had done eating, they said, “There is a broom for thee, sweep all clean for us outside by the back-door.”"
"“哼！你们自己去扫吧，”女孩回答说，“我可不是你们的仆人。”她发现他们并不给她什么礼物，便走出屋去。小矮人们又商量道：“她真是没规矩，心肠也坏，妒心也重，不愿助人，我们该送她点什么呢？”第一个小矮人说：“我要她越来越丑。”第二个小矮人说：“我要她每次张口说话就会吐出一只癞蛤蟆。”第三个小矮人说：“我要让她饱受煎熬，慢慢死去。”女孩到外面去寻找草莓，可一个都没有找到，只好生气地回家了。她张开嘴巴，想要告诉她母亲自己在林中的遭遇，可她每说一个字就会吐出一只癞蛤蟆，每个人都被她吓呆了。","“Humph！Sweep for yourselves,” she answered, “I am not your servant.”When she saw that they were not going to give her anything, she went out by the door.Then the little men said to each other, “What shall we give her as she is so naughty, and has a wicked envious heart, that will never let her do a good turn to any one?”The first said, “I grant that she may grow uglier every day.”The second said, “I grant that at every word she says, a toad shall spring out of her mouth.”The third said, “I grant that she may die a miserable death.”The maiden looked for strawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home.And when she opened her mouth, and was about to tell her mother what had happened to her in the wood, with every word she said, a toad sprang out of her mouth, so that every one was seized with horror of her."
"后母更加气愤，她满心只想着怎样对付男人那越长越漂亮的女儿。后来，后母拿来一只大锅，她把锅放在火炉上，又把纱线放到锅中煮着。水沸后，她将纱线搭在可怜的女孩的肩膀上，又递给她一把斧子，让她去结了冰的河上凿出一个洞，来清洗纱线。女孩服从了后母，到河边去凿洞，她正凿洞的时候，一辆华丽的马车驶过来，车里坐着一位国王。马车停了下来，国王问道：“小姑娘，你是谁呀，在这里做什么呢？”“我是个苦命的女孩，在这里清洗纱线。”国王很同情她，又看到女孩那么漂亮，便对她说：“你愿意和我一起走吗？”女孩答道：“啊，当然了，我很愿意。”因为她很高兴能远离自己的后母和后母的女儿。","Then the step-mother was still more enraged, and thought of nothing but how to do every possible injury to the man’s daughter, whose beauty, however, grew daily greater.At length she took a cauldron, set it on the fire, and boiled yarn in it.When it was boiled, she flung it on the poor girl’s shoulder, and gave her an axe in order that she might go on the frozen river, cut a hole in the ice, and rinse the yarn.She was obedient, went thither and cut a hole in the ice; and while she was in the midst of her cutting, a splendid carriage came driving up, in which sat the King.The carriage stopped, and the King asked, “My child, who are thou, and what art thou doing here?”“I am a poor girl, and I am rinsing yarn.”Then the King felt compassion, and when he saw that she was so very beautiful, he said to her, “Wilt thou go away with me?”“Ah, yes, with all my heart,” she answered, for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister."
"于是，她坐上马车同国王一起离开了，他们来到王宫后，便如小矮人祝愿的那样，隆重地举行了婚礼。一年过去了，年轻的王后生下了一个男孩，她的后母听说了女孩的好运气后，便带着女儿来到了王宫，假装是来看望她。然而，一天国王出宫了，也没有其他人在场，狠毒的后母和她的女儿便分别抓住王后的头和脚，把她从窗户上扔向了外面的小河。然后，那个丑女孩躺到王后的床上，她的母亲用被子蒙住了女孩的头。国王回来后，想和妻子说说话，可后母却嚷道：“安静，安静，现在别说话，她正躺着不停地冒汗呢；今天就让她休息一下吧。”国王并没有起疑心，直到第二天早上才再回来。他与假王后说起话来，假王后每次回答的时候就会从口中吐出一只癞蛤蟆，以前吐的可是金子啊。于是，他问这是怎么一回事，后母回答说是因为王后流汗太多引起的，很快就会恢复了。夜里，国王厨房里的仆人看到一只鸭子沿着排水沟游了上来，鸭子说：","So she got into the carriage and drove away with the King, and when they arrived at his palace, the wedding was celebrated with great pomp, as the little men had granted to the maiden.When a year was over, the young Queen bore a son, and as the step-mother had heard of her great good-fortune, she came with her daughter to the palace and pretended that she wanted to pay her a visit.Once, however, when the King had gone out, and no one else was present, the wicked woman seized the Queen by the head, and her daughter seized her by the feet, and they lifted her out of the bed, and threw her out of the window into the stream which flowed by.Then the ugly daughter laid herself in the bed, and the old woman covered her up over her head.When the King came home again and wanted to speak to his wife, the old woman cried, “Hush, hush, that can’t be now, she is lying in a violent perspiration; you must let her rest to-day.”The King suspected no evil, and did not come back again till next morning; and as he talked with his wife and she answered him, with every word a toad leaped out, whereas formerly a piece of gold had fallen out.Then he asked what that could be, but the old woman said that she had got that from the violent perspiration, and would soon lose it again.During the night, however, the scullion saw a duck come swimming up the gutter, and it said,"
"“国王，你在做什么啊？睡着了还是醒着呢？”","“King, what art thou doing now?Sleepest thou, or wakest thou?”"
"仆人没说话，鸭子又说：","And as he returned no answer, it said,"
"“我的后母和她的女儿在做什么呢？”","“And my guests, What may they do?”"
"仆人说：“他们正在酣睡呢。”","The scullion said, “They are sleeping soundly, too.”"
"于是鸭子又问道：","Then it asked again,"
"“我的小宝宝在干什么呢？”","“What does little baby mine?”"
"仆人回答说：","He answered,"
"“他在摇篮里睡得正香。”","“Sleepeth in his cradle fine.”"
"然后，她变回王后的样子，回到楼上去给婴儿喂奶，摇了摇他的小床，给他盖好被子，然后又变成鸭子沿着排水沟游走了。她这样来了两个晚上，第三天晚上的时候，她对仆人说：“你去告诉国王，把他的宝剑拿出来，一开始就在我头上晃三下。”于是，仆人便跑去向国王报告，国王带来宝剑，在她的头上晃了三下，当他晃动第三下的时候，她的妻子忽然就出现在了他的面前，还像以前一样生气勃勃，健康又美丽。国王高兴极了，但他把王后藏在了一个屋子里，直到星期天给婴儿施洗礼。婴儿接受完洗礼后，他问道：“一个将别人拽下床又扔到河里的人应该收到什么处罚？”后母回答说：“这种人就该把他装进满是钉子的桶里，然后把圆桶推下山，让它一直滚到水里。”国王说：“那就是给你的惩罚。”他命人拿来一个满是钉子的圆桶，将后母和她的女儿都装进了桶里，还将桶盖钉得紧紧的，然后让桶顺着山坡一直滚进了河里。","Then she went upstairs in the form of the Queen, nursed the baby, shook up its little bed, covered it over, and then swam away again down the gutter in the shape of a duck.She came thus for two nights; on the third, she said to the scullion, “Go and tell the King to take his sword and swing it three times over me on the threshold.”Then the scullion ran and told this to the King, who came with his sword and swung it thrice over the spirit, and at the third time, his wife stood before him strong, living, and healthy as she had been before.Thereupon the King was full of great joy, but he kept the Queen hidden in a chamber until the Sunday, when the baby was to be christened.And when it was christened he said, “What does a person deserve who drags another out of bed and throws him in the water?”“The wretch deserves nothing better,” answered the old woman, “than to be taken and put in a barrel stuck full of nails, and rolled down hill into the water.”“Then,” said the King, “Thou hast pronounced thine own sentence;” and he ordered such a barrel to be brought, and the old woman to be put into it with her daughter, and then the top was hammered on, and the barrel rolled down hill until it went into the river."
