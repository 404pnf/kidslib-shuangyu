"第五个车轮","The Fifth Wheel"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"天气很冷，排队等候床铺过夜的人群更加紧密地挤在一起。他们便是纽约第五大街和百老汇交界的三角地带里，被生活的洪流冲刷出来的沉淀物。排队的人跺着冻僵了的双脚，望着麦迪逊广场上因为严寒而无法继续露宿的空荡荡的长椅，用混乱的语言相互喃喃地交谈着。熨斗大厦突兀地、穿云驾雾般耸立在路对面的三角洲上，将蒙眬不清的阴影投在他们身上。这大厦有可能代表了巴别塔，由此，说着不同语言的、无家可归的人们便被代表上帝的天使召唤而来。","The ranks of the Bed Line moved closer together; for it was cold.They were alluvial deposit of the stream of life lodged in the delta of Fifth Avenue and Broadway.The Bed Liners stamped their freezing feet, looked at the empty benches in Madison Square whence Jack Frost had evicted them, and muttered to one another in a confusion of tongues.The Flatiron Building, with its impious, cloud-piercing architecture looming mistily above them on the opposite delta, might well have stood for the tower of Babel, whence these polyglot idlers had been called by the winged walking delegate of the Lord."
"牧师站在比羊群高出一头的松木箱上，教诲着所有由北风送来的过往行人和不断变换的听众。这像一个奴隶市场。只要花15分钱，你就能买到一个人。你把他立契转让给睡神，负责记录的天使便会为你记上一功。","Standing on a pine box a head higher than his flock of goats, the Preacher exhorted whatever transient and shifting audience the north wind doled out to him.It was a slave market.Fifteen cents bought you a man.You deeded him to Morpheus; and the recording angel gave you credit."
"牧师认真地讲述着，不知疲倦，真令人难以置信。他查看了能为这些同胞做的一系列事情，并且承担了一项任务，就是在周三和周日的晚上，安顿所有可能到他的临时演讲台那儿申请铺位的人。剩下的五个夜晚，就由别的慈善家来处理。如果他们同样负责好自己的工作，那么这个邪恶的城市或许已经成为了一个巨大的田园牧歌似的居住区。在那儿，所有人都能打盹，在鼾声中打发快乐的时光，让问题剧、收房租的人和各种生计都见鬼去吧。","The preacher was incredibly earnest and unwearied.He had looked over the list of things one may do for one’s fellow man, and had assumed for himself the task of putting to bed all who might apply at his soap box on the nights of Wednesday and Sunday.That left but five nights for other philanthropists to handle; and had they done their part as well, this wicked city might have become a vast Arcadian dormitory where all might snooze and snore the happy hours away, letting problem plays and the rent man and business go to the deuce."
"刚过了八点钟，一小群黑压压的观望者，像可采矿石一样，聚集在沃思将军纪念碑的阴影下。时不时地，会有一些人，或是羞涩地，或是招摇地，或是漫不经心地，亦或是小心精准地走过来，捐给牧师小额钞票或是银币。然后，一个拥有着斯堪的纳维亚人外表及热情的中尉，就会把这一小队被救赎的人带到寄宿处去。牧师始终劝诫着人群，措辞中巧妙地避免了华丽的修辞，只是死气沉沉地、客观地、千篇一律地陈述着真理。在排队等候床铺的人群慢慢消散前，你必须听牧师讲的一句话——也就是他那晚劝诫的主题。这句话值得印在全世界所有的白色缎带上。","The hour of eight was but a little while past; sightseers in a small, dark mass of pay ore were gathered in the shadow of General Worth’s monument.Now and then, shyly, ostentatiously, carelessly, or with conscientious exactness one would step forward and bestow upon the Preacher small bills or silver.Then a lieutenant of Scandinavian coloring and enthusiasm would march away to a lodging house with a squad of the redeemed.All the while the Preacher exhorted the crowd in terms beautifully devoid of eloquence—splendid with the deadly, accusative monotony of truth.Before the picture of the Bed Liners fades you must hear one phrase of the Preacher’s—the one that formed his theme that night.It is worthy of being stenciled on all the white ribbons in the world."
"“没有人想要为五分钱的威士忌酒而当个醉汉。”","@“No man ever learned to be a drunkard on five-cent whisky.”@"
"想想吧，酒鬼。这句话的范围很广，从出芽的黑麦地一直覆盖到义冢地。","Think of it, tippler.It covers the ground from the sprouting rye to the Potter’s Field."
"一个外表干净、身板儿笔直的年轻人站在等候床铺队伍的后排，他像水龟一样，把头深深地缩在如龟壳一般的衣领里。他穿着剪裁精良的花呢外套；裤子上仍然有被熨斗熨烫过的痕迹。但是从良心上讲，我一定要警告正在读这篇故事的女帽店学徒，如果期待看到一个像雷金纳德·蒙特雷索那样的落魄公子的故事，就不必再看下去了。因为这个年轻人不过是托马斯·麦奎德，一个月前因为醉酒而被解雇的马车夫，现在落魄到排在脏兮兮的等待过夜床铺的队伍里。","A clean-profiled, erect young man in the rear rank of the bedless emulated the terrapin, drawing his head far down into the shell of his coat collar.It was a well-cut tweed coat; and the trousers still showed signs of having flattened themselves beneath the compelling goose.But, conscientiously, I must warn the milliner’s apprentice who reads this, expecting a Reginald Montressor in straits, to peruse no further.The young man was no other than Thomas McQuade, ex-coachman, discharged for drunkenness one month before, and now reduced to the grimy ranks of the one-night bed seekers."
"如果你生活在较小的纽约城，你一定知道范斯迈思家那辆由两匹1500磅重的、100比1都能获胜的栗色快马拉着的马车。马车的形状就像一个浴盆。范斯迈思老夫人会斜倚在车厢这端或那端，拿着一把黑色遮阳伞，伞只有除夕夜的羽毛拂那么大。败落之前，托马斯·麦奎德曾驾驶过范斯迈思家栗色快马拉的马车，而他则受范斯迈思夫人的女佣安妮驱使。但是，鞋子太小，手头拮据或是牙疼，都会使丘比特的崇拜者一时叛逆，这是罗曼史里最令人伤心的事了。并且，托马斯身体上的问题还不少。因此，与和夫人的女佣分手相比，对一些本不存在的事情的幻想给他带来了更大的困扰：他紧张的神经几乎使他相信他在柏油路上，在这个凄凉的、排队等候床铺的队伍周围和上空飞行、舞蹈、爬行、蠕动。大概四周的纯威士忌，以及仅限于由饼干、腊肠和泡菜构成的饮食，通常会造成某种心理动物学后果。因此，他绝望、寒冷、愤怒，仿佛被幽灵困扰，他感觉自己需要人类的同情和交流。","If you live in smaller New York you must know the Van Smuythe family carriage, drawn by the two 1,500-pound, 100 to 1-shot bays.The carriage is shaped like a bath-tub.In each end of it reclines an old lady Van Smuythe holding a black sunshade the size of a New Year’s Eve feather tickler.Before his downfall Thomas McQuade drove the Van Smuythe bays and was himself driven by Annie, the Van Smuythe lady’s maid.But it is one of the saddest things about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a temporary heretic of any Cupid-worshiper.And Thomas’s physical troubles were not few.Therefore, his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost lady’s maid than it was by the fancied presence of certain non-existent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him were flying, dancing, crawling, and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around the dismal campus of the Bed Line army.Nearly four weeks of straight whisky and a diet limited to crackers, bologna, and pickles often guarantees a psycho-zoological sequel.Thus desperate, freezing, angry, beset by phantoms as he was, he felt the need of human sympathy and intercourse."
"排在他右边的是一个与他年龄相仿的年轻人，衣着破旧却整洁。","The Bed Liner standing at his right was a young man of about his own age, shabby but neat."
"“你怎么了，老弟？”托马斯用同为受诅咒者的惺惺相惜的口吻亲切地问道：“因为酗酒吗？那就和我一样了。你看起来不像个乞丐。我也不是。一个月前，我还驾着两匹最棒的佩尔什栗色马在第五大街上飞驰，每英里只需要两分八秒五。现在再看看我！说吧，你是如何来到这个特价床位义卖会的？”","“What’s the diagnosis of your case, Freddy?” asked Thomas, with the freemasonic familiarity of the damned—“Booze?That’s mine.You don’t look like a panhandler.Neither am I.A month ago I was pushing the lines over the backs of the finest team of Percheron buffaloes that ever made their mile down Fifth Avenue in 2.85.And look at me now!Say; how do you come to be at this bed bargain-counter rummage sale.”"
"另一个年轻人似乎欢迎爱幻想的前马车夫的搭讪。","The other young man seemed to welcome the advances of the airy ex-coachman."
"“不，”他说，“我当然不是因为酗酒。除非我们允许丘比特当酒保。在那些不谅解我的亲戚看来，我的婚结得很不明智。因为不会干活我已经失业一年了，而且我又生病了，在贝尔维和别的医院住了好几个月的院。我的妻子和孩子不得不回娘家去。昨天我被医院赶出来了。我现在身无分文。这就是我悲剧性的故事。”","“No,” said he, “mine isn’t exactly a case of drink.Unless we allow that Cupid is a bartender.I married unwisely, according to the opinion of my unforgiving relatives.I’ve been out of work for a year because I don’t know how to work; and I’ve been sick in Bellevue and other hospitals for months.My wife and kid had to go back to her mother.I was turned out of the hospital yesterday.And I haven’t a cent.That’s my tale of woe.”"
"“真不幸，”托马斯说，“要是光棍一个还对付得过去。但是我不愿意看见女人和孩子受累。”","“Tough luck,” said Thomas.“A man alone can pull through all right.But I hate to see the women and kids get the worst of it.”"
"就在这时，第五大街上响起了汽车的嗡嗡声，那是一辆豪华轿车，颜色鲜红，跑得顺畅，娴熟地打破限速规定，甚至引起了这些无精打彩的排队等床位的人的关注。车左侧挂着一个备用胎。","Just then there hummed up Fifth Avenue a motor car so splendid, so red, so smoothly running, so craftily demolishing the speed regulations that it drew the attention even of the listless Bed Liners.Suspended and pinioned on its left side was an extra tire."
"当汽车从这群不幸的人对面开过时，备用胎的栓扣松了。轮胎掉在柏油路上，弹起，紧紧地跟在飞驰的车子后面快速滚动。","When opposite the unfortunate company the fastenings of this tire became loosed.It fell to the asphalt, bounded and rolled rapidly in the wake of the flying car."
"托马斯·麦奎德嗅到了机会的气味，从牧师的羊群中冲了出去。仅仅在三十秒内，他便抓到了滚动的轮胎，把它扛在肩上，跟在车后一路小跑。大街两边的人们叫喊着，吹着口哨，向那红色的车摇着藤条，指着那个有魄力的、扛着掉下来的轮胎追赶汽车的托马斯。","Thomas McQuade, scenting an opportunity, darted from his place among the Preacher’s goats.In thirty seconds he had caught the rolling tire, swung it over his shoulder, and was trotting smartly after the car.On both sides of the avenue people were shouting, whistling, and waving canes at the red car, pointing to the enterprising Thomas coming up with the lost tire."
"托马斯估计，那个坐汽车的有钱人至少也得给他一美元作为服务的报酬，这样也挽救了自己的面子。","One dollar, Thomas had estimated, was the smallest guerdon that so grand an automobilist could offer for the service he had rendered, and save his pride."
"车子在两个街区外停了下来。司机是一个长着棕色皮肤的小个子，他把自己裹在衣帽里面；后排坐着一位仪表堂堂的绅士，身穿一件昂贵的海豹皮大衣，头戴一顶丝绸帽子。","Two blocks away the car had stopped.There was a little, brown, muffled chauffeur driving, and an imposing gentleman wearing a magnificent sealskin coat and a silk hat on a rear seat."
"前马车夫托马斯极为毕恭毕敬地奉上了刚刚获得的轮胎，他猩红色眼睛里的一抹明亮表情有意暗示着他想要得到一个或两个硬币，或是对方可以接受的更高的金额。","Thomas proffered the captured tire with his best ex-coachman manner and a look in the brighter of his reddened eyes that was meant to be suggestive to the extent of a silver coin or two and receptive up to higher denominations."
"但这表情并没有被如此理解。穿着海豹皮衣的绅士接过轮胎，把它放在车里，专注地盯着这个前马车夫，喃喃自语地说着一些难以理解的话。","But the look was not so construed.The sealskinned gentleman received the tire, placed it inside the car, gazed intently at the ex-coachman, and muttered to himself inscrutable words."
"“奇怪——奇怪！”他说，“曾经有那么一两次，甚至连我自己都以为占星术有用。那可能吗？”","“Strange—strange!” said he.“Once or twice even I, myself, have fancied that the Chaldean Chiroscope has availed.Could it be possible?”"
"然后，他对正满怀希望等待着的托马斯说了些比较容易理解的话。","Then he addressed less mysterious words to the waiting and hopeful Thomas."
"“先生，我很感激您善意地救了我的轮胎。如果可以，我想问您一个问题。您认识住在华盛顿广场北部的范斯迈思一家么？”","“Sir, I thank you for your kind rescue of my tire.And I would ask you, if I may, a question.Do you know the family of Van Smuythes living in Washington Square North?”"
"“我怎么可能不知道？”托马斯回答，“我曾经住在那儿。我多希望现在仍住在那儿。”","“Oughtn’t I to?” replied Thomas.“I lived there.Wish I did yet.”"
"穿海豹皮衣的绅士打开了车门。","The sealskinned gentleman opened a door of the car."
"“请上车吧。”他说，“我们正等您呢。”","“Step in please,” he said.“You have been expected.”"
"虽然有些惊讶，托马斯·麦奎德还是毫不犹豫地上了车。在汽车里坐着，总好过在排床的队伍里站着。但是当他卷起及膝的长袍，当汽车上路飞驰之后，他开始在心里琢磨着这次特殊的邀请。","Thomas McQuade obeyed with surprise but without hesitation.A seat in a motor car seemed better than standing room in the Bed Line.But after the lap-robe had been tucked about him and the auto had sped on its course, the peculiarity of the invitation lingered in his mind."
"“或许这个人没带零钱，”他这样判断，“很多这样放荡挥霍的人都不带现金。我猜，一旦他到了能弄到现金的地方，就会把我打发走。不管怎样，我肯定已经结束了抢占床位的露天集会。”","“Maybe the guy hasn’t got any change,” was his diagnosis.“Lots of these swell rounders don’t lug about any ready money.Guess he’ll dump me out when he gets to some joint where he can get cash on his mug.Anyhow, it’s a cinch that I’ve got that open-air bed convention beat to a finish.”"
"埋进自己的大外套，神秘的汽车绅士自己似乎也对生活中的意外发现感到诧异。“太好了！太神奇了！太奇怪了！”他不断地对自己重复着这句话。","Submerged in his greatcoat, the mysterious automobilist seemed, himself, to marvel at the surprises of life.“Wonderful! Amazing! Strange!” he repeated to himself constantly."
"当汽车已经平稳地进入穿过市区的70号大街时，它又摇晃着向东边行驶了半个街区，在一排高门廊的褐砂石房屋前停了下来。","When the car had well entered the crosstown Seventies it swung eastward a half block and stopped before a row of high-stooped, brownstone-front houses."
"“请与我一同进屋。”下车后，穿海豹皮衣的绅士说。“他一定是要给我钱。”托马斯这样想着，跟了进去。","“Be kind enough to enter my house with me,” said the sealskinned gentleman when they had alighted.“He’s going to dig up, sure,” reflected Thomas, following him inside."
"大厅里光线很暗。主人领他进入左边的一扇门，从他身后关上门，他们就被留在了完全的黑暗中。突然，一个装饰奇异的夜光球在巨大的房间中心微弱地发着光。对托马斯来说，这个场景比他在舞台上见过的或在童话里读到的任何事物都要美。","There was a dim light in the hall.His host conducted him through a door to the left, closing it after him and leaving them in absolute darkness.Suddenly a luminous globe, strangely decorated, shone faintly in the centre of an immense room that seemed to Thomas more splendidly appointed than any he had ever seen on the stage or read of in fairy tales."
"墙壁隐藏在美丽的、绣有金色绝美图案的红色挂饰后面。房间的后方挂着暗淡的金门帘，门帘上闪烁着银色新月和星星。家具是最昂贵、最稀有的款式。前马车夫的双脚陷入了如同雪堆般柔软而深厚的毛皮地毯里。三四张形状古怪的看台或桌子被黑天鹅绒帷帐盖着。","The walls were hidden by gorgeous red hangings embroidered with fantastic gold figures.At the rear end of the room were draped portieres of dull gold spangled with silver crescents and stars.The furniture was of the costliest and rarest styles.The ex-coachman’s feet sank into rugs as fleecy and deep as snowdrifts.There were three or four oddly shaped stands or tables covered with black velvet drapery."
"托马斯·麦奎德用一只眼睛观赏着这所宫殿似的寓所里的奇观。另一只眼睛则寻找着威风凛凛的领路人——却发现他已经消失不见。","Thomas McQuade took in the splendors of this palatial apartment with one eye.With the other he looked for his imposing conductor—to find that he had disappeared."
"“天哪！”托马斯喃喃地说，“这看起来像一家鬼店。我简直怀疑这就是书上提到的摩拉维亚之夜的冒险。不知那个穿着皮衣的家伙怎么样了。”","“B’gee!” muttered Thomas, “this listens like a spook shop.Shouldn’t wonder if it ain’t one of these Moravian Nights’ adventures that you read about.Wonder what became of the furry guy.”"
"突然，站在光球旁边黑檀栖木上面的猫头鹰标本缓慢地抬起了翅膀，它的双眼里发出明亮的电光。","Suddenly a stuffed owl that stood on an ebony perch near the illuminated globe slowly raised his wings and emitted from his eyes a brilliant electric glow."
"托马斯吓得咒骂起来，抓起旁边橱柜里的一尊赫柏青铜雕像，用尽全力猛地朝那可怕的、让人忍无可忍的鸟砸去。猫头鹰和他的栖木被撞倒在地。伴随着这个声响，咔嗒一声，光线从墙上、天花板上那些原本黯然无光的球体里涌射进屋子。金色门帘散开又合起，神秘的汽车乘客进了屋。他个子很高，穿着剪裁精良、非常得体的晚礼服。光滑的金棕色范戴克式胡须，相当长且像波浪一样的头发，均匀分开、又大又有吸引力的东方式的神秘双眼，这些给了他最吸引人、最出众的外表。如果你能想象出俄罗斯大公在首领觐见室前去迎接来访的皇帝时的情景，你便能体会到从他的举止中透出的威严。但是托马斯·麦奎德几乎是得了震颤性谵妄症，这使他忘记了礼数。当他看到了这奢华优雅又有点恐怖的主人时，他模糊地想起了牙医。","With a fright-born imprecation, Thomas seized a bronze statuette of Hebe from a cabinet near by and hurled it with all his might at the terrifying and impossible fowl.The owl and his perch went over with a crash.With the sound there was a click, and the room was flooded with light from a dozen frosted globes along the walls and ceiling.The gold loriaes parted and closed, and the mysterious automobilist entered the room.He was tall and wore evening dress of perfect cut and accurate taste.A Vandyke beard of glossy, golden brown, rather long and wavy hair, smoothly parted, and large, magnetic, orientally occult eyes gave him a most impressive and striking appearance.If you can conceive a Russian Grand Duke in a Rajah’s throne-room advancing to greet a visiting Emperor, you will gather something of the majesty of his manner.But Thomas McQuade was too near his d t’s to be mindful of his p’s and q’s.When he viewed this silken, polished, and somewhat terrifying host he thought vaguely of dentists."
"“说吧，医生，”他有些厌恶地说，“你养的鸟可真够厉害的。希望我没有打坏任何东西。当它朝我亮起32支光的灯泡时，我被吓得魂飞魄散，就抓起站在餐具柜上的小黄铜熨斗女孩儿给它拍了张快照。”","“Say, doc,” said he resentfully, “that’s a hot bird you keep on tap.I hope I didn’t break anything.But I’ve nearly got the williwalloos, and when he threw them 32-candle-power lamps of his on me, I took a snap-shot at him with that little brass Flatiron Girl that stood on the sideboard.”"
"“那只是一个机械玩具。”绅士一边招手，一边说，“我能请你坐一坐么？我会解释为什么带你来我的房子。或许你不会理解，也不会同情促使我这样做的心理原因。因此，我冒昧地、直截了当地谈谈你承认自己知道华盛顿广场北部的范斯迈思家这件事。”","“That is merely a mechanical toy,” said the gentleman with a wave of his hand.“May I ask you to be seated while I explain why I brought you to my house.Perhaps you would not understand nor be in sympathy with the psychological prompting that caused me to do so.So I will come to the point at once by venturing to refer to your admission that you know the Van Smuythe family, of Washington Square North.”"
"“丢银器了么？”托马斯尖刻地问，“珠宝不见了吗？我当然知道他们家的事。老夫人的遮阳伞不见了吗？是的，我知道他们。那又怎样？”","“Any silver missing?” asked Thomas tartly.“Any joolry displaced?Of course I know ’em.Any of the old ladies’ sunshades disappeared?Well, I know ’em.And then what?”"
"大公两只白皙的手合在一起轻轻地搓着。","The Grand Duke rubbed his white hands together softly."
"“太好了！”他喃喃地说，“太好了！我能开始相信迦勒底占星术么？我向你保证，”他继续说，“你没什么可害怕的。相反，我觉得我能保证，好运正等着你呢。等着瞧吧。”","“Wonderful!” he murmured.“Wonderful!Shall I come to believe in the Chaldean Chiroscope myself?Let me assure you,” he continued, “that there is nothing for you to fear.Instead, I think I can promise you that very good fortune awaits you.We will see.”"
"“他们想要我回去么？”托马斯问，口气里有一些曾为职业马车夫的骄傲。“如果他们愿意再次雇用我，我保证不再酗酒并做好该做的事。但是你怎么变得这么有见识，医生？天哪，这是我见过的最好的职业介绍所了，这里还有闪光的猫头鹰等东西。”","“Do they want me back?” asked Thomas, with something of his old professional pride in his voice.“I’ll promise to cut out the booze and do the right thing if they’ll try me again.But how did you get wise, doc?B’gee, it’s the swellest employment agency I was ever in, with its flashlight owls and so forth.”"
"露出宽容的微笑，和蔼的主人请求离开两分钟。他出门走到人行道，向在车里待命的司机下了指令。回到神秘的公寓，他在客人旁坐下，开始和他用诙谐、亲切的口吻交谈，并很好地招待他。这可怜的排床人，几乎忘记了寒冷的街头，虽然他刚刚才从那儿被莫名其妙地解救出来。仆人拿来一些嫩禽肉和茶点，还有一杯神奇的酒；托马斯感觉到阿拉伯的魅力包裹着他。因此，半小时很快过去，然后门口传来返回的汽车的喇叭声。大公突然站起来，又一次礼貌地请求暂时离开。","With an indulgent smile the gracious host begged to be excused for two minutes.He went out to the sidewalk and gave an order to the chauffeur, who still waited with the car.Returning to the mysterious apartment, he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so well by his witty and genial converse that the poor Bed Liner almost forgot the cold streets from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued.A servant brought some tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine; and Thomas felt the glamour of Arabia envelop him.Thus half an hour sped quickly; and then the honk of the returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the Grand Duke to his feet, with another soft petition for a brief absence."
"在寒冷中裹得很严实的两个女人从前门进入。房主温和地引领她们通过大厅，穿过另一道门往左转，进入一个小房间。小房间与前面更大的房间被沉重的双层门帘分隔开来。这里的陈设与其他房间里的相比，更加讲究，更加精致优雅。一张镶金的紫檀桌上，散放着白纸单及一个奇怪的三角形乐器或是玩具，它显然是金子的，下面还有小轮子。","Two women, well muffled against the cold, were admitted at the front door and suavely conducted by the master of the house down the hall through another door to the left and into a smaller room, which was screened and segregated from the larger front room by heavy, double loriaes.Here the furnishings were even more elegant and exquisitely tasteful than in the other.On a gold-inlaid rosewood table were scattered sheets of white paper and a queer, triangular instrument or toy, apparently of gold, standing on little wheels."
"高一点的女人揭开黑色面纱，解开了外衣。她50岁模样，一张悲伤的脸上长满了皱纹。另一位女士年轻、丰满，她在稍远的地方向后拉开一张椅子，很像服务员或侍者。","The taller woman threw back her black veil and loosened her cloak.She was fifty, with a wrinkled and sad face.The other, young and plump, took a chair a little distance away and to the rear as a servant or an attendant might have done."
"“你派人去叫我，凯鲁布斯克教授，”年长的女子不耐烦地说，“我希望你有比平时更有把握的事情可以说。对你的法术，我已失去了原本就不多的信心。要不是我妹妹坚持，我今晚就不会来了。”","“You sent for me, Professor Cherubusco,” said the elder woman, wearily.“I hope you have something more definite than usual to say.I’ve about lost the little faith I had in your art.I would not have responded to your call this evening if my sister had not insisted upon it.”"
"“女士，”教授说着，露出他最高贵的微笑，“真正的法术是不会失败的。寻找真正的通灵术以及潜在的巫术分支有时需要一些时间。我承认我们用卡片、水晶、星星、扎拉辛的魔法配方都没能成功，波河神谕也不行。但是我们最终还是发现了真正的通灵途径。迦勒底占星已经在我们的探寻中成功。”","“Madam,” said the professor, with his princeliest smile, “the true Art cannot fail.To find the true psychic and potential branch sometimes requires time.We have not succeeded, I admit, with the cards, the crystal, the stars, the magic formulæ of Zarazin, nor the Oracle of Po.But we have at last discovered the true psychic route.The Chaldean Chiroscope has been successful in our search.”"
"教授说话的口气似乎表明他非常肯定自己的话。年长的女子看着他，稍微有了点兴趣。","The professor’s voice had a ring that seemed to proclaim his belief in his own words.The elderly lady looked at him with a little more interest."
"“为什么我亲手写的字占出来没有任何意义，”她说，“你是什么意思？”","“Why, there was no sense in those words that it wrote with my hands on it,” she said.“What do you mean?”"
"“真正占出来的字是，”凯鲁布斯克的嗓门提到了最高，“四轮马车有第五个轮子时，他就会出现。”","“The words were these,” said Professor Cherubusco, rising to his full magnificent height: “‘@By the fifth wheel of the chariot he shall come.@’”"
"“我见过很多马车，”夫人说，“但是我也从来没见过有五个轮子的。”","“I haven’t seen many chariots,” said the lady, “but I never saw one with five wheels.”"
"“进步，”教授说，“科学和机械的进步已经实现了这一点——虽然，准确地说，它只是一个备用轮胎。超自然艺术相应地发展。女士，我要再说一次，迦勒底占星已经成功。我不仅能回答你提出的问题，我还能让你看到证据。”","“Progress,” said the professor—“progress in science and mechanics has accomplished it—though, to be exact, we may speak of it only as an extra tire.Progress in occult art has advanced in proportion.Madam, I repeat that the Chaldean Chiroscope has succeeded.I can not only answer the question that you have propounded, but I can produce before your eyes the proof thereof.”"
"现在，这位女士同时被自己的怀疑和镇定扰乱。","And now the lady was disturbed both in her disbelief and in her poise."
"“哦，教授！”她不安地喊，“什么时候？——在哪儿？找到他了么？不要让我担心。”","“O professor!” she cried anxiously—“When?—where?Has he been found?Do not keep me in suspense.”"
"“我请求您允许我失陪几分钟，”凯鲁布斯克教授说，“我想我能向您展示真正的法术的功效。”","“I beg you will excuse me for a very few minutes,” said Professor Cherubusco, “and I think I can demonstrate to you the efficacy of the true Art.”"
"托马斯正满足地咀嚼着最后的面包屑和禽肉，这时，巫师突然出现在他的身边。","Thomas was contentedly munching the last crumbs of the bread and fowl when the enchanter appeared suddenly at his side."
"“如果有人保证欢迎你并且给你恢复原职来帮助你，你愿意回到原来的家么？”他殷勤而礼貌地笑着问。","“Are you willing to return to your old home if you are assured of a welcome and restoration to favor?” he asked, with his courteous, royal smile."
"“我看起来疯狂吗？”托马斯回答，“我已经受够了流浪汉的苦头。但是他们还会用我么？那老夫人对于她自己想法的坚持，就像新斧子上的螺丝那般牢固。”","“Do I look bughouse?” answered Thomas.“Enough of the footback life for me.But will they have me again?The old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut on a new axle.”"
"“我亲爱的年轻人，”另一个人说，“她已经在到处找你了。”","“My dear young man,” said the other, “she has been searching for you everywhere.”"
"“太好了！”托马斯说，“这工作我干定了。他们称作马的那两头患了水肿病的单峰骆驼，像我这样的一流车夫也觉得头疼，但是我一定会接受这份工作的，医生。他们是容易相处的人。”","“Great!” said Thomas.“I’m on the job.That team of dropsical dromedaries they call horses is a handicap for a first-class coachman like myself; but I’ll take the job back, sure, doc.They’re good people to be with.”"
"现在，巴格达的哈里发温柔的面容上出现了变化。他看着前马车夫，敏锐的眼神中带有一丝怀疑。","And now a change came o’er the suave countenance of the Caliph of Bagdad.He looked keenly and suspiciously at the ex-coachman."
"“我能问问你的名字么？”他简短地说。","“May I ask what your name is?” he said shortly."
"“你一直在找我，”托马斯说，“不知道我的名字么？你真是个滑稽的侦探。你一定是中心局的警察吧。我当然是托马斯·麦奎德，我曾经在范斯迈思家给那两头大象当了一年的车夫。一周前他们解雇了我，因为——好吧，医生，你都看到了我对你的老猫头鹰做了什么了。我因为酗酒而破产，当我看见轮胎从你跑得飞快的车上掉下来的时候，我正站在沃思将军纪念碑旁的流浪汉队伍里，等着一个免费的床位。现在，我回答了您所有的问题，有没有什么对最佳答案的奖励？”","“You’ve been looking for me,” said Thomas, “and don’t know my name?You’re a funny kind of sleuth.You must be one of the Central Office gumshoers.I’m Thomas McQuade, of course; and I’ve been chauffeur of the Van Smuythe elephant team for a year.They fired me a month ago for—well, doc, you saw what I did to your old owl.I went broke on booze, and when I saw the tire drop off your whiz wagon I was standing in that squad of hoboes at the Worth monument waiting for a free bed.Now, what’s the prize for the best answer to all this?”"
"使托马斯非常惊讶的是，连一句解释都没有，教授提起他的衣领，把他拖到门口。门被打开了，教授用他那只巨大的阿拉伯鞋子使劲儿地把他踢下台阶，力量很大，彻底打破了他的幻想，并让他觉得颜面尽失。","To his intense surprise Thomas felt himself lifted by the collar and dragged, without a word of explanation, to the front door.This was opened, and he was kicked forcibly down the steps with one heavy, disillusionizing, humiliating impact of the stupendous Arabian’s shoe."
"前马车夫重新站起来，整理了思绪后便尽可能快地向东边的百老汇跑去。","As soon as the ex-coachman had recovered his feet and his wits he hastened as fast as he could eastward toward Broadway."
"“疯子，”他这样评价那个神秘的车主，“我猜，他只是想开个有趣的玩笑。不管怎么说，他至少应该给我一美元。我得加快脚步回到排床的流浪汉队伍里，在他们听着说教去睡觉前。”","“Crazy guy,” was his estimate of the mysterious automobilist.“Just wanted to have some fun kiddin’, I guess.He might have dug up a dollar, anyhow.Now I’ve got to hurry up and get back to that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep.”"
"当托马斯结束了两英里的路程后，他发现流浪者的数量减少到每组八或十个人。在后排左末端新来的人旁边，他找到了一个合适的位置。纵列里，站在他前面的是那个告诉了他有关医院和他妻子孩子的一些事的人。","When Thomas reached the end of his two-mile walk he found the ranks of the homeless reduced to a squad of perhaps eight or ten.He took the proper place of a newcomer at the left end of the rear rank.In a file in front of him was the young man who had spoken to him of hospitals and something of a wife and child."
"“很遗憾看见你又回来了，”年轻人转过来对他说，我本来希望你碰上比这更好的事呢。”","“Sorry to see you back again,” said the young man, turning to speak to him.“I hoped you had struck something better than this.”"
"“我？”托马斯说，“哦，我只是在这大厦周围跑一圈取暖！我看今晚捐钱的人不太踊跃。”","“Me?” said Thomas.“Oh, I just took a run around the block to keep warm!I see the public ain’t lending to the Lord very fast to-night.”"
"“在这样的季节，”年轻人说，“慈善也用这句谚语了，从家里开始，在家里结束。”","“In this kind of weather,” said the young man, “charity avails itself of the proverb, and both begins and ends at home.”"
"牧师和他热忱的中尉长向上帝和人民唱起最后的赞歌。排床铺的队伍里，那些气管温度还在零摄氏度以上的人，也绝望地、不入调地唱了起来。","And the Preacher and his vehement lieutenant struck up a last hymn of petition to Providence and man.Those of the Bed Liners whose windpipes still registered above 32 degrees hopelessly and tunelessly joined in."
"第二章诗篇念到一半的时候，托马斯看到一个强健的女孩拿着被风晃动的帷幔，逆着风，从对面的人行道上径直走来。“安妮！”他喊着，向她跑去。","In the middle of the second verse Thomas saw a sturdy girl with wind-tossed drapery battling against the breeze and coming straight toward him from the opposite sidewalk.“Annie!” he yelled, and ran toward her."
"“你个傻瓜，你个傻瓜！”她喊着，哭着，大笑着，搂住他的脖子，“你为什么做这样的事？”","“You fool, you fool!” she cried, weeping and laughing, and hanging upon his neck, “why did you do it?”"
"“那玩意儿，”托马斯简单地解释，“你知道。但是以后再也不喝了。一滴都不喝了。”他领她来到路边。“你是怎么看到我的？”","“The Stuff,” explained Thomas briefly.“You know.But subsequently nit.Not a drop.”He led her to the curb.“How did you happen to see me?”"
"“我特意来找你，”安妮紧紧地抓着他的袖子说，“哦，你这个大傻瓜！凯鲁布斯克教授告诉我们可以在这儿找到你。”","“I came to find you,” said Annie, holding tight to his sleeve.“Oh, you big fool!Professor Cherubusco told us that we might find you here.”"
"“凯什么教授——不认识这个人。他在哪家酒吧干活？”","“Professor Ch—Don’t know the guy.What saloon does he work in?”"
"“他是一个“千里眼”，托马斯，世界上最了不起的“千里眼”。他说他用迦勒底望远镜找到你的。”","“He’s a clairvoyant, Thomas; the greatest in the world.He found you with the Chaldean telescope, he said.”"
"“他是一个骗子，”托马斯说，“我从来就没有望远镜。他也从来没看到我用任何人的望远镜。”","“He’s a liar,” said Thomas.“I never had it.He never saw me have anybody’s telescope.”"
"“并且他说你是驾着五轮马车来的。”","“And he said you came in a chariot with five wheels or something.”"
"“安妮，”托马斯热切地说，“你现在正在给我轮子。如果我有一辆马车，我早就住在里面了。那样就不用唱赞美诗，也不用为了免于露宿街头而听牧师的说教了。”","“Annie,” said Thoms solicitously, “you’re giving me the wheels now.If I had a chariot I’d have gone to bed in it long ago.And without any singing and preaching for a nightcap, either.”"
"“听着，你这个大笨蛋。夫人说她会让你回去。我求她答应的。但是你一定要好好表现。你今晚就可以回去，你以前在马厩上面的房间已经准备好了。”","“Listen, you big fool.The Missis says she’ll take you back.I begged her to.But you must behave.And you can go up to the house to-night; and your old room over the stable is ready.”"
"“太好了！”托马斯真挚地说，“你真好，安妮。但这些惊人的事是什么时候发生的？”","“Great!” said Thomas earnestly.“You are It, Annie.But when did these stunts happen?”"
"“今晚在凯鲁布斯克教授的家。他派车去接夫人，夫人把我带上了。我曾经和她一起去过。”","“To-night at Professor Cherubusco’s.He sent his automobile for the Missis, and she took me along.I’ve been there with her before.”"
"“教授的职业是什么？”","“What’s the professor’s line?”"
"“他是一个“千里眼”，是一个巫师。夫人向他求教。他什么都知道。虽然夫人已经付给了他几百美元，可他一直没帮上夫人的忙。但是他告诉我们，从星象上来看，我们可以在这里找到你。”","“He’s a clearvoyant and a witch.The Missis consults him.He knows everything.But he hasn’t done the Missis any good yet, though she’s paid him hundreds of dollars.But he told us that the stars told him we could find you here.”"
"“那老夫人想要这个家伙做什么？”","“What’s the old lady want this cherry-buster to do?”"
"“这是一个家族秘密，”安妮说，“你问的问题够多了。回家吧，你这个大笨蛋。”","“That’s a family secret,” said Annie.“And now you’ve asked enough questions.Come on home, you big fool.”"
"他们离开了几步，托马斯又停下来。","They had moved but a little way up the street when Thomas stopped."
"“安妮，你带钱了么？”他问。","“Got any dough with you, Annie?” he asked."
"安妮严厉地看着他。","Annie looked at him sharply."
"“哦，我知道这样的表情是什么意思，”托马斯说，“你错了。我再也不喝酒了。但是那儿有个人，在排床队伍里一直站在我旁边，他的身体状况很糟糕。他是那么友善，还有妻儿，但是他还生着病。我不会再酗酒了。如果你能找到半块钱给他，他就能得到一个相当好的床位，我只是想要这样。”","“Oh, I know what that look means,” said Thomas.“You’re wrong.Not another drop.But there’s a guy that was standing next to me in the bed line over there that’s in bad shape.He’s the right kind, and he’s got wives or kids or something, and he’s on the sick list.No booze.If you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed I’d like it.”"
"安妮的手指开始在钱包里翻弄。","Annie’s fingers began to wiggle in her purse."
"“当然，我带了钱，”她说，“有很多。12美元。”带着女人根深蒂固的、对那些以做好事为借口来骗钱的人的怀疑，她又说：“带他到我这儿来，让我先见见他。”","“Sure, I’ve got money,” said she.“Lots of it.Twelve dollars.”And then she added, with woman’s ineradicable suspicion of vicarious benevolence:“Bring him here and let me see him first.”"
"托马斯照她的话办了。面无血色的排床人欣然前来。他们俩走近时，看着钱包的安妮抬起头，尖叫道：“沃尔特先生——哦——沃尔特先生！”","Thomas went on his mission.The wan Bed Liner came readily enough.As the two drew near, Annie looked up from her purse and screamed,""Mr. Walter—Oh—Mr.  Walter!"""
"“是你么，安妮？”年轻人温顺地问。","“Is that you, Annie?” said the young man meekly."
"“哦，沃尔特先生！——夫人一直在苦苦地寻找你！”","“Oh, Mr. Walter!—and the Missis hunting high and low for you!”"
"“妈妈想要见我么？”他问道，苍白的脸颊上现出一丝红晕。","“Does mother want to see me?” he asked, with a flush coming out on his pale cheek."
"“她一直在苦苦地寻找你。当然，她想要见到你。她想让你回家。她试着找警察、到太平间查资料、雇律师、登广告、请侦探、悬赏，一切能用的手段都用了。然后她请了巫师。你马上就会回家，是不是，沃尔特先生？”","“She’s been hunting for you high and low.Sure, she wants to see you.She wants you to come home.She’s tried police and morgues and lawyers and advertising and detectives and rewards and everything.And then she took up clearvoyants.You’ll go right home, won’t you, Mr. Walter?”"
"“如果她想让我回去，我很乐意，”年轻人说，“三年是漫长的时光。但我想我不得不走着去，除非街上的汽车肯让我搭便车。我过去常常比那两匹拉车的老栗色马走得还快。它们现在还在么？”","“Gladly, if she wants me,” said the young man.“Three years is a long time.I suppose I’ll have to walk up, though, unless the street cars are giving free rides.I used to walk and beat that old plug team of bays we used to drive to the carriage.Have they got them yet?”"
"“还在，”托马斯激动地说，“再过十年他们还会在。皇家象马的寿命是149年。我是那个马车夫。五分钟前才得到允许重新回去就职。我们打车走吧——就是说——呃——如果安妮可以付车费。”","“They have,” said Thomas, feelingly.“And they’ll have ’em ten years from now.The life of the royal elephantibus truckhorseibus is one hundred and forty-nine years.I’m the coachman.Just got my reappointment five minutes ago.Let’s all ride up in a surface car—that is—er—if Annie will pay the fares.”"
"在百老汇的车上，安妮递给这两个浪子每人一个镍币付给司机。","On the Broadway car Annie handed each one of the prodigals a nickel to pay the conductor."
"“在我看来，你好像不顾后果地扔了一大笔钱。”托马斯挖苦道。","“Seems to me you are mighty reckless the way you throw large sums of money around,” said Thomas sarcastically."
"“钱包里，”安妮果断地说，“准确地说有11块8毛5分钱。我明天将会把这每一分钱都给凯鲁布斯克教授，他是这个世界上最伟大的人。”","“In that purse,” said Annie decidedly, “is exactly $11.85.I shall take every cent of it to-morrow and give it to professor Cherubusco, the greatest man in the world.”"
"“好，”托马斯说，“我猜他一定是个很好的侦探，按照自己的独特方式处理事情。我很高兴他的鬼魂告诉他你可以在哪里找到我。如果你给我他的地址，某天我会去他那儿，和他握握手。”","“Well,” said Thomas, “I guess he must be a pretty fly guy to pipe off things the way he does.I’m glad his spooks told him where you could find me.If you’ll give me his address, some day I’ll go up there, myself, and shake his hand.”"
"托马斯试着在自己的位置上扭动着身体，感觉到膝盖和肘部有几处擦伤。","Presently Thomas moved tentatively in his seat, and thoughtfully felt an abrasion or two on his knees and his elbows."
"“说吧，安妮，”他悄悄地说，“或许这是最后一次醉酒的幻觉，但是，我已经回忆起和一个挥霍者坐在一辆汽车里，他带我到一个充满了鹰和弧光灯的房子。他让我吃饼干，跟我吹牛，然后把我从台阶上踢下去。倘若是震颤性谵妄的话，我为什么会如此酸痛呢？”","“Say, Annie,” said he confidentially, “maybe it’s one of the last dreams of booze, but I’ve a kind of a recollection of riding in an automobile with a swell guy that took me to a house full of eagles and arc lights.He fed me on biscuits and hot air, and then kicked me down the front steps.If it was the d t’s, why am I so sore?”"
"“闭嘴，你这个混蛋。”安妮说。","“Shut up, you fool,” said Annie."
"“如果我能找到那个滑稽的人的房子，”托马斯总结性地说，“总有一天我会去那儿，一拳打在他的鼻子上。”","“If I could find that funny guy’s house,” said Thomas, in conclusion, “I’d go up there some day and punch his nose for him.”"
