"办公室的讨厌鬼","The Office Bore"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain"
"他每天早上到办公室的时间，就像钟表敲响九点一样规律。有时他甚至比编辑到得还早，大楼管理员只能放下手头工作，爬两三层楼去开“圣所”的门，让他进去。他点燃办公室里的一只烟斗——也没有考虑，编辑可能也是“高傲”的人，他们这些人会立马找人把他的烟斗换成牙刷。接着，他开始懒洋洋地靠在一边——因为一个愿意让自己无用的生命消耗在可耻的懒惰中的人，是没有力气挺直腰板坐正的。他一会儿全身舒展地躺在沙发上，一会儿又蜷缩起来，只有刚才的一半长；接着他坐到椅子上，头往后仰，双臂伸展，双腿伸直，直到他鞋子的后跟边缘抵到地上；渐渐地他又坐直，身体前倾，一条腿或两条腿搭在椅子的扶手上。不过，很显然，无论他怎么变换姿势，他从来就没想要摆出一副正直或假正经的模样。他时而打打哈欠，伸伸懒腰，安静地挠挠痒，享受着污秽的生活，时而嘴里咕哝几声，声音中带着沉闷，很像动物吃得太饱而发出的满足声。然而，长时间休息时，他也会长长地叹气，像是在做秘密忏悔时的慷慨陈词，即“我是个废物，是个讨厌鬼，是地球上的累赘。”这个讨厌鬼和他的同仁——因为不管白天还是晚上，总有两到四个人在边上——在有人来找编辑谈公事时，就会凑一起谈话；他们在一起会闹哄哄地谈论，特别是讨论政治，还有其他一切普通的话题——即使有时是勉强的话前热身，他们也看似对自己谈论的事情很感兴趣。他们会无忌惮地打扰正在工作的编辑，比如冒出一句：“史密斯，你在《公报》上看过这个吗？”接着就把那段话读了出来，遭殃的编辑只能止住他不耐烦的笔，听他们瞎扯；而他们通常一小时又一小时地懒洋洋地躺卧在办公室里，相互闲扯着各种趣闻轶事，以及自己的奇特经历——像死里逃生、邂逅名人、选举往事、稀奇古怪的人的事情等等。而在这些时间里，他们似乎从未意识到，他们的闲扯不但抢走了编辑们宝贵的时间，还降低了公众第二天在报纸上读到的新闻的质量。在其他时候，他们会打打瞌睡，或是朦胧地钻研刚才的交流，又或者是耷拉着脑袋，沉思地在椅子的扶手上靠上一个钟头。这严肃的沉默，对于编辑来说，只是短暂的休息，因为也许接下来讨厌鬼会让人站在他后面看着他，可能还会让这些编辑们静静地坐着，听他的钢笔在纸上划过的沙沙声，让人很不舒服。如果有人想跟某一位编辑谈私事，他必须得把编辑叫到外面去，因为只有用炸药或硝化甘油才能避免被那些讨厌鬼听见，没有其他更温和的暗示手段了。一天又一天坐在办公室里，忍受讨厌鬼的存在；一听见他上楼梯的脚步声，原本愉悦的情绪就开始跌落，等到他那看着就让人冒火的身影走进办公室时，好心情就彻底消失了；不断遭到他所谓的趣闻的折磨，慢慢在他没完没了的往事回忆中变得麻木不堪；只要他在，就觉得拘束不堪；绝望地期盼着，能有一天是完全属于自己的；没过多久，又惊恐地发现，即使假想着他的葬礼也不能够减轻痛苦，即使幻想着他在古代宗教法庭上遭受严刑拷打也无法解气泄恨，就算是诅咒他下数百万米深的地狱，也只能换来片刻的欢愉。这样日复一日、周复一周、月复一月地忍受一切，远远超过了人所能承受的其他痛苦。身体上的痛苦仅是消遣，绞死他才是快乐的旅行。","He arrives just as regularly as the clock strikes nine in the morning.And so he even beats the editor sometimes, and the porter must leave his work and climb two or three pairs of stairs to unlock the “Sanctum” door and let him in.He lights one of the office pipes—not reflecting, perhaps, that the editor may be one of those “stuck-up” people who would as soon have a stranger defile his tooth-brush as his pipe-stem.Then he begins to loll—for a person who can consent to loaf his useless life away in ignominious indolence has not the energy to sit up straight.He stretches full length on the sofa awhile; then draws up to half length; then gets into a chair, hangs his head back and his arms abroad, and stretches his legs till the rims of his boot-heels rest upon the floor; by and by sits up and leans forward, with one leg or both over the arm of the chair.But it is still observable that with all his changes of position, he never assumes the upright or a fraudful affectation of dignity.From time to time he yawns, and stretches, and scratches himself with a tranquil, mangy enjoyment, and now and then he grunts a kind of stuffy, overfed grunt, which is full of animal contentment.At rare and long intervals, however, he sighs a sigh that is the eloquent expression of a secret confession, to wit “I am useless and a nuisance, a cumberer of the earth.”The bore and his comrades—for there are usually from two to four on hand, day and night—mix into the conversation when men come in to see the editors for a moment on business; they hold noisy talks among themselves about politics in particular, and all other subjects in general—even warming up, after a fashion, sometimes, and seeming to take almost a real interest in what they are discussing.They ruthlessly call an editor from his work with such a remark as: “Did you see this, Smith, in the Gazette?” and proceed to read the paragraph while the sufferer reins in his impatient pen and listens; they often loll and sprawl round the office hour after hour, swapping anecdotes and relating personal experiences to each other—hairbreadth escapes, social encounters with distinguished men, election reminiscences, sketches of odd characters, etc.And through all those hours they never seem to comprehend that they are robbing the editors of their time, and the public of journalistic excellence in next day’s paper.At other times they drowse, or dreamily pore over exchanges, or droop limp and pensive over the chair-arms for an hour.Even this solemn silence is small respite to the editor, for the next uncomfortable thing to having people look over his shoulders, perhaps, is to have them sit by in silence and listen to the scratching of his pen.If a body desires to talk private business with one of the editors, he must call him outside, for no hint milder than blasting-powder or nitroglycerin would be likely to move the bores out of listening-distance.To have to sit and endure the presence of a bore day after day; to feel your cheerful spirits begin to sink as his footstep sounds on the stair, and utterly vanish away as his tiresome form enters the door; to suffer through his anecdotes and die slowly to his reminiscences; to feel always the fetters of his clogging presence; to long hopelessly for one single day’s privacy; to note with a shudder, by and by, that to contemplate his funeral in fancy has ceased to soothe, to imagine him undergoing in strict and fearful detail the tortures of the ancient Inquisition has lost its power to satisfy the heart, and that even to wish him millions and millions and millions of miles in Tophet is able to bring only a fitful gleam of joy; to have to endure all this, day after day, and week after week, and month after month, is an affliction that transcends any other that men suffer.Physical pain is pastime to it, and hanging a pleasure excursion."
