"这两个年轻人来到莫斯科河边，沿河岸走着。河面上吹来一阵新鲜的风，水波轻微的荡漾声缓缓摩挲着他们的耳膜。","The young men went down to the river Moskva and walked along its bank.There was a breath of freshness from the water, and the soft plash of tiny waves caressed the ear."
"“我又想游泳了，”舒宾说，“只是我怕会迟到。看那河水，它好像在召唤我们呢。古希腊人相信每条河中都有一个女神。但我们不是希腊人，哦，我的女神！我们是粗鲁的西塞亚人。”","‘I would have another bathe,’ said Shubin, ‘only I’m afraid of being late.Look at the river; it seems to beckon us.The ancient Greeks would have beheld a nymph in it.But we are not Greeks, O nymph!we are thick-skinned Scythians.’"
"“但我们有美人鱼啊。”别尔谢涅夫讲道。","‘We have roussalkas,’ observed Bersenyev."
"“算了吧，还美人鱼呢！那些满脑袋都是冰冷恐怖幻想的孩子，那些在漆黑冬夜中沉闷的小木屋里幻想出来的形象，对于我——一个雕塑家——能有什么用呢？我想要的是光线，空间……博爱的上帝啊，我什么时候才能去意大利啊？什么时候？”","‘Get along with your roussalkas!What’s the use to me—a sculptor—of those children of a cold, terror-stricken fancy, those shapes begotten in the stifling hut, in the dark of winter nights?I want light, space….Good God, when shall I go to Italy?When—’"
"“我想你的意思是说要去小俄罗斯？”","‘To Little Russia, I suppose you mean?’"
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇，你是不好意思当面指责我粗心大意吧，就算你不说，我也已经为自己的愚蠢懊悔不已。哦，是的，我简直就是个傻瓜，以前安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜曾好心资助我去意大利，但我却跑去小俄罗斯吃饺子，然后——”","‘For shame, Andrei Petrovitch, to reproach me for an act of unpremeditated folly, which I have repented bitterly enough without that.Oh, of course, I behaved like a fool; Anna Vassilyevna most kindly gave me the money for an expedition to Italy, and I went off to the Little Russians to eat dumplings and—’"
"“算了，请你别再接着说了。”别尔谢涅夫打断了他的话。","‘Don’t let me have the rest, please,’ interposed Bersenyev."
"“不过，我还是要说，那些钱并没有被浪费掉。我在那里见到了许多不同的事物，尤其是女人……当然，我知道，如果不去意大利的话，人就永远得不到救赎！”","‘Yet still, I will say, the money was not spent in vain.I saw there such types, especially of women….Of course, I know; there is no salvation to be found outside of Italy!’"
"“就算你去了意大利，”别尔谢涅夫说着，看都没看他一眼，“你也不会有什么成就。你只会不停地拍打着翅膀，却永远都飞不起来。我们太了解你啦！”","‘You will go to Italy,’ said Bersenyev, without turning towards him, ‘and will do nothing.You will always be pluming your wings and never take flight.We know you!’"
"“斯塔瓦瑟尔倒是飞起来了，而且他不是唯一能飞起来的那个人。如果我飞不起来，那只能说明我是海里的一只企鹅，没有翅膀而已。呆在这里我简直就要闷死了，我想去意大利，”舒宾接着说道，“那里有阳光，那里有美女。”","‘Stavasser has taken flight….And he’s not the only one.If I don’t fly, it will prove that I’m a sea penguin, and have no wings.I am stifled here, I want to be in Italy,’pursued Shubin, ‘there is sunshine, there is beauty.’"
"此时，一个头戴大草帽，肩上抵着粉色太阳伞的少女出现在他们视野里，走在他们所在的小径上。","A young girl in a large straw hat, with a pink parasol on her shoulder, came into sight at that instant, in the little path along which the friends were walking."
"“瞧，我看到什么了？即便在这里，也有美女——她朝我们这边走过来了！美丽的卓娅小姐，一个谦卑的艺术家向你致敬！”舒宾立刻叫了起来，滑稽地挥了挥他的帽子。","‘But what do I see?Even here, there is beauty—coming to meet us!A humble artist’s compliments to the enchanting Zoya!’Shubin cried at once, with a theatrical flourish of his hat."
"那个女孩停了下来，用手指指着大喊的舒宾，等到他俩走近时，她用银铃般的声音说道：","The young girl to whom this exclamation referred, stopped, threatening him with her finger, and, waiting for the two friends to come up to her, she said in a ringing voice:"
"“怎么回事，先生们，你们怎么不去吃饭？饭都已经准备好了。”","‘Why is it, gentlemen, you don’t come in to dinner?It is on the table.’"
"“我听到了什么？”舒宾举起了他的胳膊，说，“难道你，迷人的卓娅，顶着大太阳出门就是来找我们吗？我可以这样理解你的意思吗？告诉我，可以吗？或者，等一下，请你不要告诉我真是这样的，不然我就要后悔死了。”","‘What do I hear?’ said Shubin, throwing his arms up.‘Can it be that you, bewitching Zoya, faced such heat to come and look for us?Dare I think that is the meaning of your words?Tell me, can it be so?Or no, do not utter that word; I shall die of regret on the spot.’"
"“哦，不要这样，帕维尔·雅克夫利奇，”那个少女有些懊恼地说，“你为什么就不能正经些和我说话呢？我可要生气啦。”她有点儿轻佻地做着鬼脸，还撅着嘴巴。","‘Oh, do leave off, Pavel Yakovlitch,’ replied the young girl with some annoyance.‘Why will you never talk to me seriously?I shall be angry,’ she added with a little coquettish grimace, and she pouted."
"“你可别生我气呀，完美的卓娅·尼基季什娜，你千万别让我陷入到绝望的深渊里。我本来就是个放荡不羁的人，所以才常与你开玩笑。”","‘You will not be angry with me, ideal Zoya Nikitishna; you would not drive me to the dark depths of hopeless despair.And I can’t talk to you seriously, because I’m not a serious person.’"
"少女耸了耸肩，转向别尔谢涅夫。","The young girl shrugged her shoulders, and turned to Bersenyev."
"“你看，他一直都是那样，他总是把我当成小孩子，可我都十八岁了。现在我已经是大人了。”","‘There, he’s always like that; he treats me like a child; and I am eighteen.I am grown-up now.’"
"“哦，上帝！”舒宾叹了口气，翻了个白眼，而别尔谢涅夫则轻轻地笑了。","‘O Lord!’ groaned Shubin, rolling his eyes upwards; and Bersenyev smiled quietly."
"少女使劲地跺了跺她的小脚。","The girl stamped with her little foot."
"“帕维尔·雅克夫利奇，我可真要生气啦！埃琳娜本来要和我一起的，”她说，“但后来她却去花园了。她很怕热，但我却不怕。走吧。”","‘Pavel Yakovlitch, I shall be angry!Helene was coming with me,’ she went on, ‘but she stopped in the garden.The heat frightened her, but I am not afraid of the heat.Come along.’"
"她沿着小径向前走去，每挪一步，那纤细的身体都会轻轻地摇摆一下，还不时用戴着黑色手套的小手把挡在脸上、柔顺卷曲的长发拨到后面去。","She moved forward along the path, slightly swaying her slender figure at each step, and with a pretty black-mittened little hand pushing her long soft curls back from her face."
"两个年轻人跟在她的后面（舒宾先是一言不发地把双手用力地按在胸前，接着又把它们举过头顶），没过多久他们就来到了一幢别墅前，这座房子位于孔佐沃周边的别墅区里。在花园中间，坐落着一幢带有顶楼的木制小房子，墙被刷成了粉色，看上去它就像躲在绿树林后面无辜地窥探着外面的世界。卓娅第一个打开了大门，她跑到花园里，大声叫道：“我把那两个出去闲逛的人带回来了！”一个面色苍白却表情丰富的少女从小路旁边的一个长椅上站了起来，在房门口，一个身穿紫色丝绸连衣裙的夫人站在那里，用一条麻布绣花手绢放在额头上挡太阳，面色疲倦地笑着。","The friends walked after her (Shubin first pressed his hands, without speaking, to his heart, and then flung them higher than his head), and in a few instants they came out in front of one of the numerous country villas with which Kuntsovo is surrounded.A small wooden house with a gable, painted a pink colour, stood in the middle of the garden, and seemed to be peeping out innocently from behind the green trees.Zoya was the first to open the gate; she ran into the garden, crying: ‘I have brought the wanderers!’A young girl, with a pale and expressive face, rose from a garden bench near the little path, and in the doorway of the house appeared a lady in a lilac silk dress, holding an embroidered cambric handkerchief over her head to screen it from the sun, and smiling with a weary and listless air."
"第三章","CHAPTER III"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜·斯塔霍夫——没出嫁前姓舒宾——七岁时就成了一个孤儿，继承了一笔相当丰厚的遗产。她既有些富亲戚，也有些穷亲戚。父亲那边的亲戚都很穷，母亲那边的则很富有——包括参议员沃尔金和齐库拉索夫公爵一家。阿尔达里翁·齐库拉索夫公爵被指定为她的法定监护人，他把她送到了莫斯科最好的寄宿学校，在她毕业后，带她回自己家生活。他经常在冬天里广邀宾客，频繁地举办各种舞会。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇·斯塔霍夫，也就是安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜后来的丈夫，就是在一次这样的舞会上获得了她的芳心。那次她穿了件迷人的玫瑰色长礼服，头上还带着由小玫瑰花编成的花环。她一生都十分喜欢那种花环。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇·斯塔霍夫的父亲是一个已经退役的上校，他在1812年的卫国战争中受了伤，然后被安排在彼得堡一个待遇很好的职位工作。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇在十六岁的时候进入军校，毕业后加入了禁卫军。他英俊潇洒，体格健壮，在他经常出现的中产阶级的舞会上，几乎被公认为最耀眼的美男子。当时，他还没能进入上流社会。从小他就有两个愿望：成为一名皇家警卫员，娶一个富有的老婆，前一个愿望他很快就放弃了；但对后一个愿望，他倒是越来越努力，正因为如此，他每年冬天都要来莫斯科。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇法语说得很流利，还获得了哲学家的头衔，因为他不放纵自己。当他还是个少尉时，他就很喜欢固执地和别人讨论一些问题，比如说一个人在一生中有没有可能环游世界，或是人们有没有可能知道海底世界到底是什么样子。他总认为这些事情都是不可能做到的。","Anna Vassilyevna Stahov—her maiden name was Shubin—had been left, at seven years old, an orphan and heiress of a pretty considerable property.She had very rich and also very poor relations; the poor relations were on her father’s, the rich on her mother’s side; the latter including the senator Volgin and the Princes Tchikurasov.Prince Ardalion Tchikurasov, who had been appointed her guardian, placed her in the best Moscow boarding-school, and when she left school, took her into his own home.He kept open house, and gave balls in the winter.Anna Vassilyevna’s future husband, Nikolai Artemyevitch Stahov, captured her heart at one of these balls when she was arrayed in a charming rose-coloured gown, with a wreath of tiny roses.She had treasured that wreath all her life.Nikolai Artemyevitch Stahov was the son of a retired captain, who had been wounded in 1812, and had received a lucrative post in Petersburg.Nikolai Artemyevitch entered the School of Cadets at sixteen, and left to go into the Guards.He was a handsome, well-made fellow, and reckoned almost the most dashing beau at evening parties of the middling sort, which were those he frequented for the most part; he had not gained a footing in the best society.From his youth he had been absorbed by two ideals: to get into the Imperial adjutants, and to make a good marriage; the first ideal he soon discarded, but he clung all the more closely to the second, and it was with that object that he went every winter to Moscow.Nikolai Artemyevitch spoke French fairly, and passed for being a philosopher, because he was not a rake.Even while he was no more than an ensign, he was given to discussing, persistently, such questions as whether it is possible for a man to visit the whole of the globe in the course of his whole lifetime, whether it is possible for a man to know what is happening at the bottom of the sea; and he always maintained the view that these things were impossible."
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇“钓”上安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的时候二十五岁，之后他就退役，到乡下来打理产业。他很快就厌倦了乡村生活，由于当时乡下已改为只收农民的代役租了，所以他很轻松地离开了庄园，住在了他妻子莫斯科的房子里。年轻时他从不打牌，但现在却迷上了罗托，当不能玩罗托的时候，他又迷上了惠斯特。他在家里觉得很无聊，所以就勾搭上了一个带有德国血统的寡妇，而且几乎所有时间都和她在一起。1853年他没有和其他人一起搬去孔佐沃，他留在了莫斯科，表面上说是想利用这里的矿泉水，事实上，他是不想离开他的那个寡妇。然而，他却跟她没多少话说，谈论的也多是像“人能否预知天气”这样的问题。有次有人说他是个反对党，他还很喜欢那个称呼。“是的，”他琢磨着，得意地翘了翘嘴巴，并晃了晃脑袋，“我可不好惹，你别想骗我。”不过，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的这种反叛也只是在嘴上说说而已，比如，当他听到神经这个词语的时候，他会问：“你说的这个词是什么意思？”或者是当有人跟他提及天文学发现时，他就会问：“你相信天文学吗？”当他想要完全压倒对方观点时，他就会说：“其实那只不过是些毫无意义的话而已。”确实，对不少人来说，这些话语是很难被反驳的（似乎到现在还是这样）。但是，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇怎么也不会想到，奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂安诺夫娜会在写给堂妹西奥多琳娜·彼得济柳斯的信中竟然称他为“我的小傻瓜”。","Nikolai Artemyevitch was twenty-five years old when he ‘hooked’ Anna Vassilyevna; he retired from the service and went into the country to manage the property.He was soon tired of country life, and as the peasants’ labour was all commuted for rent he could easily leave the estate; he settled in Moscow in his wife’s house.In his youth he had played no games of any kind, but now he developed a passion for loto, and, when loto was prohibited, for whist.At home he was bored; he formed a connection with a widow of German extraction, and spent almost all his time with her.In the year 1853 he had not moved to Kuntsovo; he stopped at Moscow, ostensibly to take advantage of the mineral waters; in reality, he did not want to part from his widow.He did not, however, have much conversation with her, but argued more than ever as to whether one can foretell the weather and such questions.Some one had once called him a frondeur; he was greatly delighted with that name.‘Yes,’ he thought, letting the corners of his mouth drop complacently and shaking his head, ‘I am not easily satisfied; you won’t take me in.’Nikolai Artemyevitch’s frondeurism consisted in saying, for instance, when he heard the word nerves: ‘And what do you mean by nerves?’ or if some one alluded in his presence to the discoveries of astronomy, asking: ‘And do you believe in astronomy?’When he wanted to overwhelm his opponent completely, he said: ‘All that is nothing but words.’It must be admitted that to many persons remarks of that kind seemed (and still seem) irrefutable arguments.But Nikolai Artemyevitch never suspected that Augustina Christianovna, in letters to her cousin, Theodolina Peterzelius, called him Mein Pinselchen."
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的妻子，是一个身型瘦小，五官精致，有点儿情绪化，又有点儿忧郁的女人。在上学的时候，她很喜欢听音乐和看小说，毕业后就把这些爱好全部抛弃了。接着她又喜欢上了漂亮的衣服，不过后来也放弃了这个爱好。曾经有段时间她自己负责女儿的教育，不过后来她又厌倦了，之后请来一个女家庭教师接替这一工作。此后，她整天伤春悲秋，敏感忧郁。生完埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜以后，她的身体就越来越差，以至于以后都不可能再有孩子了。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇也总是不断地向别人暗示这件事情，以便为他和奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂安诺夫娜的亲密交往找一个正当的理由。丈夫的不忠让安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜心里很受伤，而更让她难过的是有一次他竟偷偷摸摸地把她（安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜）马场里的两匹灰马送给了他的那个德国女人。她并没有当面指责他，但私底下却不断地给家里的人甚至她的女儿抱怨这件事情。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜不喜欢到外面去，她只喜欢客人们到家里来坐着陪她聊天，当她一个人的时候，她的情绪就会立刻崩溃。她非常温柔而且善良，生活很快耗尽了她的精力。","Nikolai Artemyevitch’s wife, Anna Vassilyevna, was a thin, little woman with delicate features, and a tendency to be emotional and melancholy.At school, she had devoted herself to music and reading novels; afterwards she abandoned all that.She began to be absorbed in dress, and that, too, she gave up.She did, for a time, undertake her daughter’s education, but she got tired of that too, and handed her over to a governess.She ended by spending her whole time in sentimental brooding and tender melancholy.The birth of Elena Nikolaevna had ruined her health, and she could never have another child.Nikolai Artemyevitch used to hint at this fact in justification of his intimacy with Augustina Christianovna.Her husband’s infidelity wounded Anna Vassilyevna deeply; she had been specially hurt by his once giving his German woman, on the sly, a pair of grey horses out of her (Anna Vassilyevna’s) own stable.She had never reproached him to his face, but she complained of him secretly to every one in the house in turn, even to her daughter.Anna Vassilyevna did not care for going out, she liked visitors to come and sit with her and talk to her; she collapsed at once when she was left alone.She had a very tender and loving heart; life had soon crushed her."
"帕维尔·雅克夫利奇·舒宾恰巧是她的一个远房亲戚。他的父亲曾在莫斯科的一个政府机构上班。他的哥哥们都进了军校，他年龄最小，母亲又十分疼爱他，再加上他身体虚弱，所以就一直呆在家里。家里人打算供他读完大学，千方百计地让他锻炼身体。从小他就显示出对雕塑的喜爱。有一天，那个肥胖的沃尔金参议员在他姑姑的房间里发现了他做的一个小雕像——他那时才十六岁——然后他就宣布他打算担保这个年轻的天才以后的发展。但是舒宾的父亲去世了，这几乎完全改变了这个年轻人的未来。那个参议员，天才的担保人，只给了舒宾一尊荷马的半身塑像做礼物，之后就再无消息。但安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜却资助了他，十九岁那年，他的分数擦边进了大学的医学院。帕维尔不是很喜欢学医，但碍于学校制定的名额限制，他不可能再转到其他的院系。此外，他也很想学习解剖学。但是，他却没有学完解剖学的课程，第一学年期末，他没参加考试就离开了学校，投入到他喜欢的塑造雕塑的工作中了。他工作努力，但却三天打渔，两天晒网。他经常到莫斯科郊外闲逛，为一些乡下姑娘画些素描，并认识了各种各样的人，有年纪轻轻的，也有白发苍苍的，有上流社会的，也有下层阶级的，有意大利模特，也有俄国艺术家。他不愿去学院里学习，也没有拜谁为师。他拥有无与伦比的才华，他的名声开始在莫斯科传播开来。他的母亲来自于巴黎的一个富有家庭，是位善良聪明的女人，她认真地教他法语，日日夜夜为他着想，为他操劳。她为他感到骄傲，但在她还很年轻的时候，她就患肺病去世了，死前她恳求安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜照料帮她照顾舒宾。那时他已经二十一岁了。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜兑现了她之前的承诺，把乡间别墅门房的一个小房间给他住。","Pavel Yakovlitch Shubin happened to be a distant cousin of hers.His father had been a government official in Moscow.His brothers had entered cadets’ corps; he was the youngest, his mother’s darling, and of delicate constitution; he stopped at home.They intended him for the university, and strained every effort to keep him at the gymnasium.From his early years he began to show an inclination for sculpture.The ponderous senator, Volgin, saw a statuette of his one day at his aunt’s—he was then sixteen—and declared that he intended to protect this youthful genius.The sudden death of Shubin’s father very nearly effected a complete transformation in the young man’s future.The senator, the patron of genius, made him a present of a bust of Homer in plaster, and did nothing more.But Anna Vassilyevna helped him with money, and at nineteen he scraped through into the university in the faculty of medicine.Pavel felt no inclination for medical science, but, as the university was then constituted, it was impossible for him to enter in any other faculty.Besides, he looked forward to studying anatomy.But he did not complete his anatomical studies; at the end of the first year, and before the examination, he left the university to devote himself exclusively to his vocation.He worked zealously, but by fits and starts; he used to stroll about the country round Moscow sketching and modelling portraits of peasant girls, and striking up acquaintance with all sorts of people, young and old, of high and low degree, Italian models and Russian artists.He would not hear of the Academy, and recognised no one as a teacher.He was possessed of unmistakeable talent; it began to be talked about in Moscow.His mother, who came of a good Parisian family, a kind-hearted and clever woman, had taught him French thoroughly and had toiled and thought for him day and night.She was proud of him, and when, while still young in years, she died of consumption, she entreated Anna Vassilyevna to take him under her care.He was at that time twenty-one.Anna Vassilyevna carried out her last wish; a small room in the lodge of the country villa was given up to him."
"第四章","CHAPTER IV"
"“过来吃饭吧，大家都过来。”女主人说道，声音中透着悲伤。大家都跟着她走进餐厅，“和我坐在一起，卓娅，”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜说，“埃琳娜，你招呼客人；而你，保罗，别再淘气去捉弄卓娅了。我今天头疼。”","‘Come to dinner, come along,’ said the lady of the house in a plaintive voice, and they all went into the dining-room.‘Sit beside me, Zoe,’ added Anna Vassilyevna, ‘and you, Helene, take our guest; and you, Paul, please don’t be naughty and tease Zoe.My head aches today.’"
"舒宾又翻了翻白眼。卓娅浅笑了一下。说到卓娅，或者更准确地说，卓娅·尼基季什娜·米勒，是一个满头金发、俄德混血的漂亮女孩。她的小嘴红红的，鼻子也小，鼻头却很宽。她的俄罗斯民歌唱得很好，还能用钢琴弹上几曲，无论是快乐还是悲伤的曲调，她都能弹奏得很好。她穿衣服很讲究，然而却总选择一些小孩子喜欢的款式，更准确地说，有时甚至会是一些特别幼稚的款式。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜本来是打算让她来给女儿做伴的，但后来却总是让她呆在自己身边。埃琳娜对此毫无怨言，因为当她和卓娅偶尔被单独留在一起时，她根本不知道能跟卓娅聊些什么。","Shubin again turned his eyes up to the ceiling; Zoe responded with a half-smile.This Zoe, or, to speak more precisely, Zoya Nikitishna Mueller, was a pretty, fair-haired, half-Russian German girl, with a little nose rather wide at the end, and tiny red lips.She sang Russian ballads fairly well and could play various pieces, both lively and sentimental, very correctly on the piano.She dressed with taste, but in a rather childish style, and even over precisely.Anna Vassilyevna had taken her as a companion for her daughter, and she kept her almost constantly at her side.Elena did not complain of that; she was absolutely at a loss what to say to Zoya when she happened to be left alone with her."
"这顿饭真是花了很长时间，别尔谢涅夫跟埃琳娜谈论着他的大学生活，他自己的计划和梦想。舒宾则只是听着，没有说话，吃饭的时候总是故意做出一副夸张的馋鬼样，并不时用透着失望的滑稽眼神瞥向卓娅，而卓娅总是那样淡淡地笑着回应他。饭后，埃琳娜、别尔谢涅夫和舒宾去了花园，卓娅看着他们的背影，微微地耸了耸肩，坐下来弹钢琴。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜说：“你怎么不和他们一起出去走走？”然而，不等卓娅回答，她就继续说道：“给我弹个悲伤一些的曲子吧。”","The dinner lasted rather a long time; Bersenyev talked with Elena about university life, and his own plans and hopes; Shubin listened without speaking, ate with an exaggerated show of greediness, and now and then threw comic glances of despair at Zoya, who responded always with the same phlegmatic smile.After dinner, Elena with Bersenyev and Shubin went into the garden; Zoya looked after them, and, with a slight shrug of her shoulders, sat down to the piano.Anna Vassilyevna began: ‘Why don’t you go for a walk, too?’ but, without waiting for a reply, she added: ‘Play me something melancholy.’"
"“那我弹韦伯的《最后的思索》怎么样？”卓娅建议道。","‘La derniere pensee de Weber?’ suggested Zoya."
"“好的，就韦伯的曲子吧。”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜回答说。她陷进一把安乐椅里听着，睫毛上开始挂上了泪珠。","‘Ah, yes, Weber,’ replied Anna Vassilyevna.She sank into an easy chair, and the tears started on to her eyelashes."
"与此同时，埃琳娜带着那两个年轻人来到了金合欢树下的一个凉亭里，凉亭中间摆着一个小木桌子，周围放着几个凳子。舒宾朝四周看了看，随后低声说：“稍等一下！”然后就跑开了，他悄悄地跑进自己的房间，拿了一块黏土回来，开始做起卓娅的半身塑像来，边做边摇着脑袋，喃喃自语，面带笑意。","Meanwhile, Elena led the two friends to an arbour of acacias, with a little wooden table in the middle, and seats round.Shubin looked round, and, whispering ‘Wait a minute!’ he ran off, skipping and hopping to his own room, brought back a piece of clay, and began modelling a bust of Zoya, shaking his head and muttering and laughing to himself."
"“还是以前的那些把戏。”埃琳娜看了一眼他的作品，说道。接着，她转向了别尔谢涅夫，继续谈论他们在餐桌上交流过的话题。","‘At his old tricks again,’ observed Elena, glancing at his work.She turned to Bersenyev, with whom she was continuing the conversation begun at dinner."
"“还是以前的那些把戏！”舒宾重复道，“雕塑真是令人百用不厌啊！尤其是今天，她令我失去了所有的耐心。”","‘My old tricks!’ repeated Shubin.‘It’s a subject that’s simply inexhaustible!Today, particularly, she drove me out of all patience.’"
"“此话怎讲？”埃琳娜问，“别人还会以为你是在说某个心怀怨恨、让人讨厌的老太婆呢。她可是个年轻漂亮的姑娘啊。”","‘Why so?’ inquired Elena.‘One would think you were speaking of some spiteful, disagreeable old woman.She is a pretty young girl.’"
"“当然，”舒宾插嘴说，“她很漂亮，非常漂亮。我十分肯定只要是见过她的人都会这样想：我绝对应该邀请她跳一曲波尔卡舞。我也十分肯定她自己知道这些而且还很高兴……但是，她那些故作谦虚的假笑和谨慎小心的举止又是为了什么呢？算了，你肯定知道我是什么意思，”他含含糊糊地说，“但现在你的心思已经飘到别的地方去了。”","‘Of course,’ Shubin broke in, ‘she is pretty, very pretty; I am sure that no one who meets her could fail to think: that’s some one I should like to—dance a polka with; I’m sure, too, that she knows that, and is pleased….Else, what’s the meaning of those modest simpers, that discreet air?There, you know what I mean,’ he muttered between his teeth.‘But now you’re absorbed in something else.’"
"弄坏了卓娅的塑像，舒宾急忙又有点儿焦躁地重新和泥塑模。","And breaking up the bust of Zoya, Shubin set hastily to modelling and kneading the clay again with an air of vexation."
"“那么，你以后希望去当老师？”埃琳娜问别尔谢涅夫。","‘So it is your wish to be a professor?’ said Elena to Bersenyev."
"“是的，”他一边说着一边把双手夹在两膝之间，“那是我一直梦寐以求的。当然，我很清楚梦想和现实之间还有着很大的差距——若是想要成为一位好老师——我的意思是指我的各个方面都还有待完善，但是目前我希望能够出国进修或游学，如果需要的话，我准备那样在国外呆个三四年，到那时——”","‘Yes,’ he answered, squeezing his red hands between his knees.‘That’s my cherished dream.Of course I know very well how far I fall short of being—to be worthy of such a high—I mean that I am too little prepared, but I hope to get permission for a course of travel abroad; I shall pass three or four years in that way, if necessary, and then—’"
"他停了下来，闭上双眼，然后又猛地睁开，他不好意思地笑了，理了理头发。当别尔谢涅夫跟女人说话的时候，他说得就更慢了，而且更加咬字不清。","He stopped, dropped his eyes, then quickly raising them again, he gave an embarrassed smile and smoothed his hair.When Bersenyev was talking to a woman, his words came out more slowly, and he lisped more than ever."
"“你想成为一位历史老师吗？”埃琳娜问。","‘You want to be a professor of history?’ inquired Elena."
"“是的，或者是哲学老师，”他低声说，“如果可能的话。”","‘Yes, or of philosophy,’ he added, in a lower voice—‘if that is possible.’"
"“他已经在哲学方面很有研究了，”舒宾边看着塑像边说，用指甲在黏土上划了几道深深的线条，“他还要出国去干嘛呢？”","‘He’s a perfect devil at philosophy already,’ observed Shubin, making deep lines in the clay with his nail.‘What does he want to go abroad for?’"
"“那你以后会完全满足于当老师的生活吗？”埃琳娜把下巴支在胳膊肘上，盯着他的脸问。","‘And will you be perfectly contented with such a position?’ asked Elena, leaning on her elbow and looking him straight in the face."
"“我会完全满足的，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，完全满足。有什么职业能比得过当老师呢？也许，我可以追随季莫费·尼古拉耶维奇的脚步前进……一想到能当老师，我的内心就充满了快乐和困惑……是的，困惑……那是由于我自身的不足引起的。我父亲很支持我做这项事业……我永远都不会忘记他临终前所说的话。”","‘Perfectly, Elena Nikolaevna, perfectly.What could be a finer vocation?To follow, perhaps, in the steps of Timofay Nikolaevitch … The very thought of such work fills me with delight and confusion … yes, confusion… which comes from a sense of my own deficiency.My dear father consecrated me to this work… I shall never forget his last words.’…"
"“你父亲是上个冬天去世的吗？”","‘Your father died last winter?’"
"“是的，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，他是二月份去世的。”","‘Yes, Elena Nikolaevna, in February.’"
"“他们都说，”埃琳娜继续说道，“你父亲生前留下了一部优秀著作的原稿，这是真的吗？”","‘They say,’ Elena went on, ‘that he left a remarkable work in manuscript; is it true?’"
"“是的。他是个令人钦佩的人。你应该会很喜欢他的，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜。”","‘Yes.He was a wonderful man.You would have loved him, Elena Nikolaevna.’"
"“我想我会的。那本著作是写什么的？”","‘I am sure I should.And what was the subject of the work?’"
"“关于那本书的内容，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，如果要我用几句话就把它讲清楚，可能会有点儿困难。我父亲是个很有学问的人，追随谢林学派，他经常会用一些令人难以理解的词汇——”","‘To give you an idea of the subject of the work in few words, Elena Nikolaevna, would be somewhat difficult.My father was a learned man, a Schellingist; he used terms which were not always very clear—’"
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇，”埃琳娜打断他的话说，“不好意思，请原谅我的无知，什么是谢林学派？”","‘Andrei Petrovitch,’ interrupted Elena, ‘excuse my ignorance, what does that mean, a Schellingist?’"
"别尔谢涅夫轻轻笑了笑。","Bersenyev smiled slightly."
"“谢林学派，是指追随德国哲学家谢林的学者组织，谢林的哲学思想是——”","‘A Schellingist means a follower of Schelling, a German philosopher; and what the philosophy of Schelling consists in—’"
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇！”舒宾突然叫了起来，“看在上帝的份上，别说了！你肯定不是要给埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜上一堂介绍谢林学派的课吧？可怜可怜她吧！”","‘Andrei Petrovitch!’ cried Shubin suddenly, ‘for mercy’s sake!Surely you don’t mean to give Elena Nikolaevna a lecture on Schelling?Have pity on her!’"
"“哪里是上什么课，”别尔谢涅夫脸色通红地嘀咕道，“我是想说——”","‘Not a lecture at all,’ murmured Bersenyev, turning crimson.‘I meant—’"
"“为什么不是上课呢？”埃琳娜说，“你和我都应该好好听听的，帕维尔·雅克夫利奇。”","‘And why not a lecture?’ put in Elena.‘You and I are in need of lectures, Pavel Yakovlitch.’"
"舒宾盯着她看了一会儿，然后突然哈哈大笑起来。","Shubin stared at her, and suddenly burst out laughing."
"“你在笑什么？”她用冷冰冰且几近严厉的语气说道。","‘What are you laughing at?’ she said coldly, and almost sharply."
"舒宾没有回答她。","Shubin did not answer."
"“好了，不要生气了，”他停了一会儿说，“对不起。但依我之见，在这样的天气里，在这样的树下，谈论一些哲学问题实在是有点儿怪怪的。我们应该聊聊夜莺和玫瑰，或是年轻的眼睛和笑容。”","‘Come, don’t be angry,’ he said, after a short pause.‘I am sorry.But really it’s a strange taste, upon my word, to discuss philosophy in weather like this under these trees.Let us rather talk of nightingales and roses, youthful eyes and smiles.’"
"“没错，还有法国小说，女人的穿着打扮。”埃琳娜说道。","‘Yes; and of French novels, and of feminine frills and fal-lals,’ Elena went on."
"“好吧，也谈谈女人的服饰，”舒宾回答说，“如果是些漂亮的衣服的话。”","‘Fal-lals, too, of course,’ rejoined Shubin, ‘if they’re pretty.’"
"“当然了，若是我们不想谈论服饰呢？你总吹嘘自己是一个自由的艺术家，那你为何还总是妨碍他人的自由呢？请允许我再问一下，如果你已经有了这种想法，为什么还要捉弄卓娅呢？和她谈女人的穿着打扮和玫瑰应该是再合适不过了？”","‘Of course.But suppose we don’t want to talk of frills?You are always boasting of being a free artist; why do you encroach on the freedom of others?And allow me to inquire, if that’s your bent of mind, why do you attack Zoya?With her it would be peculiarly suitable to talk of frills and roses?’"
"舒宾突然生气地从花园里的凳子上站了起来。“那么，你就想说这个吗？”他紧张地说道，“我现在才明白你的暗示，你想让我到她那边去吧，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜。换句话说，我在这里不受欢迎。”","Shubin suddenly fired up, and rose from the garden seat.‘So that’s it?’ he began in a nervous voice.‘I understand your hint; you want to send me away to her, Elena Nikolaevna.In other words, I’m not wanted here.’"
"“我从没想过让你离开这里。”","‘I never thought of sending you away from here.’"
"“那你是想说，”舒宾激动地说，“我不配和其他人交往，我跟那个令人讨厌的德国小妞一样，整天只顾漂亮、愚蠢无知吗？是吗？”","‘Do you mean to say,’ Shubin continued passionately, ‘that I am not worthy of other society, that I am her equal; that I am as vain, and silly and petty as that mawkish German girl?Is that it?’"
"埃琳娜皱着眉头。“你还从来没有这样数落过她呢，帕维尔·雅克夫利奇。”她回答说。","Elena frowned.‘You did not always speak like that of her, Pavel Yakovlitch,’ she remarked."
"“哦！你责怪我吧！现在就责备我吧！”舒宾喊了起来，“好吧，我承认曾经是有过一阵子——确切地说是一小段时间，当她那清新却又庸俗的脸蛋……但假如我想跟你争辩的话，就会让你知道……算了，再见了，”他突然说道，“我觉得自己要说蠢话了。”","‘Ah!reproaches! reproaches now!’ cried Shubin.‘Well, then I don’t deny there was a moment—one moment precisely, when those fresh, vulgar cheeks of hers…But if I wanted to repay you with reproaches and remind you…Good-bye,’ he added suddenly, ‘I feel I shall say something silly.’"
"举起拳头朝已经捏好的头部塑像狠狠地打了一下，舒宾跑着离开了凉亭，进了自己的房间里。","And with a blow on the clay moulded into the shape of a head, he ran out of the arbour and went off to his room."
"“真像个小孩子。”埃琳娜看着他的背影说。","‘What a baby,’ said Elena, looking after him."
"“他是个艺术家，”别尔谢涅夫浅笑着说，“所有的艺术家都这样。人们都应该习惯他们的反复无常。那可是他们的特权。”","‘He’s an artist,’ observed Bersenyev with a quiet smile.‘All artists are like that.One must forgive them their caprices.That is their privilege.’"
"“是的，”埃琳娜接着说，“但帕维尔到现在也没做出什么好作品，能让他像艺术家那样使用那项特权。迄今为止他做了什么呢？让我挽着你的胳膊，我们去林阴道上走走吧。他刚才打断了我们的谈话。我们正谈到你父亲的著作呢。”","‘Yes,’ replied Elena; ‘but Pavel has not so far justified his claim to that privilege in any way.What has he done so far?Give me your arm, and let us go along the avenue.He was in our way.We were talking of your father’s works.’"
"别尔谢涅夫拉着埃琳娜的手臂，跟她在花园里面闲逛，但他们并没有继续聊刚才被打断的话题。别尔谢涅夫又重新聊起了自己对老师这个职业的看法和对以后工作的打算。他和埃琳娜慢慢地走着，局促不安地挽着她的胳膊，他的肩膀有时也会无意中碰到她，可他却从未看她一眼，但他说话却越来越轻松了，尽管还不是那么流利。他说话言简意赅，他的眼睛里充满丰富的情感与含蓄的热情，目光缓缓从树干上、小路旁的沙堆和青草上滑过，然而从他那平静的声音中可以听出一个人在自己喜欢的人面前成功表达自己的喜悦。埃琳娜认真地听他讲着，侧转向他，目不转睛地看着他的脸，凝视着他那有点儿防卫但又温柔亲切的眼睛，虽然他一直在避免直视她的眼睛。她已经在心里渐渐地接受了他，内心深处充满了一种柔软的、神圣的和令人沉醉的感情，这种感情让她的心一半沉醉，一半激动。","Bersenyev took Elena’s arm in his, and walked beside her through the garden; but the conversation prematurely broken off was not renewed.Bersenyev began again unfolding his views on the vocation of a professor, and on his own future career.He walked slowly beside Elena, moving awkwardly, awkwardly holding her arm, sometimes jostling his shoulder against her, and not once looking at her; but his talk flowed more easily, even if not perfectly freely; he spoke simply and genuinely, and his eyes, as they strayed slowly over the trunks of the trees, the sand of the path and the grass, were bright with the quiet ardour of generous emotions, while in his soothed voice there was heard the delight of a man who feels that he is succeeding in expressing himself to one very dear to him.Elena listened to him very attentively, and turning half towards him, did not take her eyes off his face, which had grown a little paler off his eyes, which were soft and affectionate, though they avoided meeting her eyes.Her soul expanded; and something tender, holy, and good seemed half sinking into her heart, half springing up within it."
"第五章","CHAPTER V"
"在夜幕降临之前，舒宾一直把自己关在屋里。那时天已经完全黑了，月亮——还不是很圆——高高地悬挂在空中，银河闪闪发亮，星星缀满了整个天空，别尔谢涅夫在跟安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜、埃琳娜和卓娅道别之后，来到了舒宾房门前。他发现门被锁上了。他敲了敲门。","Shubin did not leave his room before night.It was already quite dark; the moon—not yet at the full—stood high in the sky, the milky way shone white, and the stars spotted the heavens, when Bersenyev, after taking leave of Anna Vassilyevna, Elena, and Zoya, went up to his friend’s door.He found it locked.He knocked."
"“谁在外面？”有人问道，听上去像舒宾的声音。","‘Who is there?’ sounded Shubin’s voice."
"“我。”别尔谢涅夫答道。","‘I,’ answered Bersenyev."
"“你来做什么？”","‘What do you want?’"
"“让我进去，帕维尔，不要再生气了，你难道一点儿都不感到惭愧吗？”","‘Let me in, Pavel; don’t be sulky; aren’t you ashamed of yourself?’"
"“我没有生气，我在睡觉呢，而且还梦到了卓娅。”","‘I am not sulky; I’m asleep and dreaming about Zoya.’"
"“得了吧，你已经不是小孩子了。让我进去。我想跟你谈谈。”","‘Do stop that, please; you’re not a baby.Let me in.I want to talk to you.’"
"“你还没跟埃琳娜聊够吗？”","‘Haven’t you had talk enough with Elena?’"
"“快点儿，快点儿，让我进去！”舒宾用假装的呼噜声回答他。","‘Come, come; let me in!’Shubin responded by a pretended snore."
"别尔谢涅夫耸了耸肩，转身回去了。","Bersenyev shrugged his shoulders and turned homewards."
"这天晚上温度适中，周围异常安静，好像所有事物都在聆听着，盼望着什么。走在这宁静夜色中的别尔谢涅夫不由自主地停下了脚步，也心怀期待地聆听着什么。在附近的树顶处，时不时地传来一阵窸窸窣窣的响声，就像女人裙子摆动时沙沙的声音，这声音令他心头涌起一种既甜蜜又痛苦的感觉，这是一种近乎恐怖的感觉。他感到脸上有些痛，双眼也因为突然涌上的泪水而冰冷，他本想悄无声息地离开，隐秘地偷偷溜走。一阵风突然从他身边吹过，他打了个寒战，他的心似乎也静止了。一只昏昏欲睡的甲虫从细枝上掉了下来，砰的一声落在了地上，别尔谢涅夫小声叫了叫道：“啊！”然后他停下了脚步。然而，他突然间想起了埃琳娜，这时，所有的恐惧或其他感觉都立刻消失了，剩下的仅仅是夜晚的清新和晚间散步的愉悦，他整个脑袋里都是埃琳娜美丽的身影。别尔谢涅夫低头走着，回想着她说过的话和她提过的问题。他好像听到身后传来急促的脚步声。他仔细听了听，有人在飞奔着，正朝着他的方向赶来，他听到了大口喘气声，忽然间，舒宾从一株大树投下的黑色圆形影子里跳出到他的面前，月光照得他脸色发白，一头卷发乱糟糟的，也没有戴帽子。","The night was warm and seemed strangely still, as though everything were listening and expectant; and Bersenyev, enfolded in the still darkness, stopped involuntarily; and he, too, listened expectant.On the tree-tops near there was a faint stir, like the rustle of a woman’s dress, awaking in him a feeling half-sweet, half-painful, a feeling almost of fright.He felt a tingling in his cheeks, his eyes were chill with momentary tears; he would have liked to move quite noiselessly, to steal along in secret.A cross gust of wind blew suddenly on him; he almost shuddered, and his heart stood still; a drowsy beetle fell off a twig and dropped with a thud on the path; Bersenyev uttered a subdued ‘Ah!’ and again stopped.But he began to think of Elena, and all these passing sensations vanished at once; there remained only the reviving sense of the night freshness, of the walk by night; his whole soul was absorbed by the image of the young girl.Bersenyev walked with bent head, recalling her words, her questions.He fancied he heard the tramp of quick steps behind.He listened: some one was running, some one was overtaking him; he heard panting, and suddenly from a black circle of shadow cast by a huge tree Shubin sprang out before him, quite pale in the light of the moon, with no cap on his disordered curls."
"“我很高兴你走了这条小路，”他喘着气说，“如果我没有赶上你，恐怕今晚就睡不着觉了。把手给我。你现在是要回家吗？”","‘I am glad you came along this path,’ he said with an effort.‘I should not have slept all night, if I had not overtaken you.Give me your hand.Are you going home?’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“那我送你回去吧。”","‘I will see you home then.’"
"“你怎么没戴帽子就过来了？”","‘But why have you come without a cap on?’"
"“没关系。我也没戴围巾。现在天气很暖和的。”","‘That doesn’t matter.I took off my neckerchief too.It is quite warm.’"
"两个年轻人向前走了几步。","The friends walked a few paces."
"“我今天很愚蠢，是吗？”舒宾突然问道。","‘I was very stupid today, wasn’t I?’ Shubin asked suddenly."
"“说实话，是的。我实在是很不理解。我以前从没见你这样过。你到底为什么生气？就为那些琐事！”","‘To speak frankly, you were.I couldn’t make you out.I have never seen you like that before.And what were you angry about really?Such trifles!’"
"“哼，”舒宾小声咕哝着，“你认为是小事，但对我来说，那些并不是小事。你要明白，”他继续说着，“我应该跟你讲清楚，我——无论你怎样看我——我——好吧！我爱上了埃琳娜。”","‘H’m,’ muttered Shubin.‘That’s how you put it; but they were not trifles to me.You see,’ he went on, ‘I ought to point out to you that I—that—you may think what you please of me—I—well there!I’m in love with Elena.’"
"“你爱上了埃琳娜！”别尔谢涅夫重复了一遍，呆呆地停下了。","‘You in love with Elena!’ repeated Bersenyev, standing still."
"“是的，”舒宾装作毫不介意地说道，“吓到你了吗？我再告诉你一件事吧。直到今天傍晚，我仍然傻乎乎地相信她总有一天会爱上我的。但是今天我才意识到这是不可能的了。她已经喜欢上别人了。”","‘Yes,’ pursued Shubin with affected carelessness.‘Does that astonish you?I will tell you something else.Till this evening I still had hopes that she might come to love me in time.But today I have seen for certain that there is no hope for me.She is in love with some one else.’"
"“别人？谁啊？”","‘Some one else?Whom?’"
"“谁？你啊！”舒宾叫了起来，打了一下别尔谢涅夫的肩膀。","‘Whom?You!’ cried Shubin, slapping Bersenyev on the shoulder."
"“我！”","‘Me!’"
"“是你。”舒宾重复了一遍。","‘You,’ repeated Shubin."
"别尔谢涅夫向后退了几步，一动不动地停在了那里。舒宾专注地看着他。","Bersenyev stepped back a pace, and stood motionless.Shubin looked intently at him."
"“你对此感到很意外吗？你是个谦逊的年轻人。但她喜欢你。对此你可以完全相信。”","‘And does that astonish you?You are a modest youth.But she loves you.You can make your mind easy on that score.’"
"“你在胡说些什么！”别尔谢涅夫最后懊恼地否认道。","‘What nonsense you talk!’Bersenyev protested at last with an air of vexation."
"“不，这并不是无稽之谈。不过我们为何要停下来呢？继续走啊。边走边说，这样更轻松些。我认识她很久了，而且我非常了解她。我不会弄错的。你已经赢得了她的芳心。曾经有一阵子她还觉得我挺不错的，但是，对于她来说，首先，我是个太轻率的年轻人，而你却是个严肃认真的人，你的品德或体魄都修养得很好，你——等一下，我还没说完——你还是个热情积极的人，是那些真正为科学献身的人，是那些——不，不是那些——是俄国中产阶级贵族真正引以为荣的人！还有，埃琳娜前几天还看到我在亲吻卓娅的手臂！”","‘No, it’s not nonsense.But why are we standing still?Let us go on.It’s easier to talk as we walk.I have known her a long while, and I know her well.I cannot be mistaken.You are a man after her own heart.There was a time when she found me agreeable; but, in the first place, I am too frivolous a young man for her, while you are a serious person, you are a morally and physically well-regulated person, you—hush, I have not finished, you are a conscientiously disposed enthusiast, a genuine type of those devotees of science, of whom—no not of whom—whereof the middle class of Russian gentry are so justly proud!And, secondly, Elena caught me the other day kissing Zoya’s arms!’"
"“卓娅的手臂？”","‘Zoya’s?’"
"“是的，卓娅的手臂。我能怎么办呢？她的双肩是如此地美丽。”","‘Yes, Zoya’s.What would you have?She has such fine shoulders.’"
"“双肩？”","‘Shoulders?’"
"“对呀，双肩和胳膊难道有区别吗？埃琳娜是在用餐后看到我那不由自主的行为的，而在用餐前，我还曾当着她的面骂过卓娅。遗憾的是埃琳娜竟不明白我这种前后矛盾的表现是很自然的。而这个时候你恰好出现了，你信仰——你信仰的是什么来着？你会脸红，你会看起来很困惑，你会跟她讲席勒和谢林（她总是想要了解那些杰出的人们），你就这样俘获了她的芳心，而我呢，一个可怜的失败者，只能试着开开玩笑——可事实上——”","‘Well there, shoulders and arms, isn’t it all the same?Elena caught me in this unconstrained proceeding after dinner, and before dinner I had been abusing Zoya in her hearing.Elena unfortunately doesn’t understand how natural such contradictions are. Then you came on the scene, you have faith in—what the deuce is it you have faith in?…You blush and look confused, you discuss Schiller and Schelling (she’s always on the look-out for remarkable men), and so you have won the day, and I, poor wretch, try to joke—and all the while—’"
"舒宾突然哭了起来，转过身去，蹲在地上紧紧抓住自己的头发。","Shubin suddenly burst into tears, turned away, and dropping upon the ground clutched at his hair."
"别尔谢涅夫走到他的面前。","Bersenyev went up to him."
"“帕维尔，”别尔谢涅夫说，“你怎么还这么幼稚！说真的！你今天到底是怎么回事？谁知道你那脑子里整天在想着什么，怎么还哭呢。依我看，你就是在装腔作势。”","‘Pavel,’ he began, ‘what childishness this is!Really! what’s the matter with you today?God knows what nonsense you have got into your head, and you are crying.Upon my word, I believe you must be putting it on.’"
"舒宾抬起头。他脸庞上的泪水在月光下闪闪发亮，表情却是笑着的。","Shubin lifted up his head.The tears shone bright on his cheeks in the moonlight, but there was a smile on his face."
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇，”他说，“你怎么想我都可以。我甚至已经准备好对你承认我现在有些歇斯底里，但是，我向上帝发誓，我是真的爱埃琳娜，但她爱上的却是你。然而我答应过要送你回家，我一定会履行诺言的。”","‘Andrei Petrovitch,’ he said, ‘you may think what you please about me.I am even ready to agree with you that I’m hysterical now, but, by God, I’m in love with Elena, and Elena loves you.I promised, though, to see you home, and I will keep my promise.’"
"他站起身来。","He got up."
"“多美的夜晚啊！银色的月光，黑色的充满活力的夜空！对那些恋爱中的人来说，这是个多么迷人的晚上啊！不睡觉对他们来说多么甜蜜啊！你想睡觉吗，安德烈·别尔谢涅夫？”","‘What a night! silvery, dark, youthful!How sweet it must be tonight for men who are loved!How sweet for them not to sleep!Will you sleep, Andrei Petrovitch?’"
"别尔谢涅夫什么也没说，只是加快了脚步。","Bersenyev made no answer, and quickened his pace."
"“你急着去哪里啊？”舒宾继续问道，“相信我，像这样美丽的夜晚你以后恐怕是再也不会遇到了，但你家里，谢林的作品却会一直在那里。没错，谢林的思想今天确实帮了你不少，但你也不用这样着急啊。唱吧，如果你会唱歌，就大声地唱吧，如果不会的话，你就拿掉帽子，抬起头来，对着星星笑吧。它们都在盯着你看，而且只盯着你。星星们仅钟爱于那些陷入爱情里的人们——这就是它们如此迷人的原因。我想你已经恋爱了，安德烈·彼得罗维奇？你不回答我……你为什么不回答我呢？”舒宾接着说道：“哦，如果你感觉开心的话，请你不要说出来，默不作声吧！我一直在不停地唠叨，是因为我是个穷鬼，没有人喜欢我，我就是个小丑，是个搞艺术的，是个十足的大傻瓜，但是，如果我知道某个人爱上了我，那么，在这星光下的夜风里，我将会陷入无以言喻的喜悦之中！别尔谢涅夫，你感觉开心吗？”","‘Where are you hurrying to?’Shubin went on.‘Trust my words, a night like this will never come again in your life, and at home, Schelling will keep.It’s true he did you good service today; but you need not hurry for all that.Sing, if you can sing, sing louder than ever; if you can’t sing, take off your hat, throw up your head, and smile to the stars.They are all looking at you, at you alone; the stars never do anything but look down upon lovers—that’s why they are so charming.You are in love, I suppose, Andrei Petrovitch?…You don’t answer me… why don’t you answer?’Shubin began again: ‘Oh, if you feel happy, be quiet, be quiet!I chatter because I am a poor devil, unloved, I am a jester, an artist, a buffoon; but what unutterable ecstasy would I quaff in the night wind under the stars, if I knew that I were loved!…Bersenyev, are you happy?’"
"别尔谢涅夫还是像刚才那样不说话，只是在平坦地小路上大步狂奔。前方，一丝丝的灯光从树林里显现出来，那是他所居住的那个村子里的灯光，那个村子由大约十二幢小别墅组成，是为夏天来度假的游客们准备的。在村口小路的右边，一个小商店位于两棵枝繁叶茂的白桦树下，商店的窗户已经关上了，但从那扇敞开的门里，灯光透出来，在门口已被踩平的草地上印出一片扇形的光影。光线在树干处向上弯折，清晰地映出树上浓密枝叶白色的背面。一个看起来像是仆人的女孩站在商店里，背靠着门边，和店主在讨价还价，她的头上围着一条红色的围巾，她用手把它紧紧地按在下巴上，在那下面，我们只能看到她那圆圆的脸蛋和细长的脖子。两个年轻人走进小店门口的光线里，舒宾朝店里看了看，停了一会儿，喊道：“安努什卡！”那女孩很快转过身来。他们看见一张美丽的脸庞。她脸型略宽，但长相甜美，面色红润，眉毛乌黑浓密，棕色的眼睛十分生动。“安努什卡！”舒宾重复了一遍。那女孩看见是他，面色变得惊慌失措、羞涩不安。她还没买完东西就急匆匆地跑下了台阶，从他们身旁快速跑过，头也不回地沿着小路向左跑去了。小店老板长得白白胖胖，任何事都惊动不了他；跟所有其他的乡下老板一样，看到这些他只是张嘴打了个哈欠，这时舒宾转头对别尔谢涅夫说：“那个……你看……我认识住在这里的一家人……所以呢，他们的房子里……你可别以为……”话没说完，他就急急忙忙去追那个刚才跑掉的女孩。","Bersenyev was silent as before, and walked quickly along the smooth path.In front, between the trees, glimmered the lights of the little village in which he was staying; it consisted of about a dozen small villas for summer visitors.At the very beginning of the village, to the right of the road, a little shop stood under two spreading birch-trees; its windows were all closed already, but a wide patch of light fell fan-shaped from the open door upon the trodden grass, and was cast upwards on the trees, showing up sharply the whitish undersides of the thick growing leaves.A girl, who looked like a maid-servant, was standing in the shop with her back against the doorpost, bargaining with the shopkeeper; from beneath the red kerchief which she had wrapped round her head, and held with bare hand under her chin, could just be seen her round cheek and slender throat.The young men stepped into the patch of light; Shubin looked into the shop, stopped short, and cried ‘Annushka!’The girl turned round quickly.They saw a nice-looking, rather broad but fresh face, with merry brown eyes and black eyebrows.‘Annushka!’ repeated Shubin.The girl saw him, looked scared and shamefaced, and without finishing her purchases, she hurried down the steps, slipped quickly past, and, hardly looking round, went along the road to the left.The shopkeeper, a puffy man, unmoved by anything in the world, like all country shopkeepers gasped and gaped after her, while Shubin turned to Bersenyev with the words: ‘That’s… you see… there’s a family here I know… so at their house… you mustn’t imagine’… and, without finishing his speech, he ran after the retreating girl."
"“你最好把脸上的眼泪擦掉。”别尔谢涅夫在他背后喊道，禁不住笑了起来。但是，当他回到家里，脸上却没了刚才那开心的表情，他笑不出来了。他压根就不相信刚才舒宾告诉他的那些话，但那些话却深深地印在了他的脑海里。","‘You’d better at least wipe your tears away,’ Bersenyev shouted after him, and he could not refrain from laughing.But when he got home, his face had not a mirthful expression; he laughed no longer.He had not for a single instant believed what Shubin had told him, but the words he had uttered had sunk deep into his soul."
"“帕维尔是在拿我寻开心的吧，”他想着，“……但她终有一天会恋爱……她以后会爱上谁呢？”","‘Pavel was making a fool of me,’ he thought; ‘… but she will love one day… whom will she love?’"
"在别尔谢涅夫的房间里，有一架小钢琴，虽然很旧，但弹起来声音柔和悦耳，虽然这音质已没有以前那样完美了。别尔谢涅夫挨着钢琴坐下，开始敲击琴键。和那些出身良好的俄国人一样，他从小就开始学习音乐，但也像几乎所有的俄国绅士那样，他的钢琴弹得很糟，但他却打心眼里热爱音乐。严格来说，他喜欢的并不是音乐这门艺术，也不是音乐的表现形式（交响乐、奏鸣曲甚至是歌剧都让他觉得厌烦），他喜爱的只是音乐本身所包含的那种意境，他喜爱那种通过悠扬的旋律浸入听者灵魂的朦胧甜蜜、无拘无束和无处不在的感觉。一个多小时过去了，他还坐在钢琴旁边，重复地弹着同样的曲子，笨拙地演奏着新的曲目，然而他总会在七音阶的地方停下，陷入沉思。他内心痛苦，眼睛里一次次地充满了泪水。但他并没有因此而感到羞愧，在这夜色里，他任眼泪尽情地流淌。“帕维尔说得对，”他寻思着，“我也觉得，这样迷人的夜晚不会再有了。”最后，他起身点了一根蜡烛，穿上外袍，从书架上拿了本历史学家劳默尔所著的《霍亨斯托芬历史》第二卷，叹了两口气，认认真真地读了起来。","In Bersenyev’s room there was a piano, small, and by no means new, but of a soft and sweet tone, though not perfectly in tune.Bersenyev sat down to it, and began to strike some chords.Like all Russians of good birth, he had studied music in his childhood, and like almost all Russian gentlemen, he played very badly; but he loved music passionately.Strictly speaking, he did not love the art, the forms in which music is expressed (symphonies and sonatas, even operas wearied him), but he loved the poetry of music: he loved those vague and sweet, shapeless, and all-embracing emotions which are stirred in the soul by the combinations and successions of sounds.For more than an hour, he did not move from the piano, repeating many times the same chords, awkwardly picking out new ones, pausing and melting over the minor sevenths.His heart ached, and his eyes more than once filled with tears.He was not ashamed of them; he let them flow in the darkness.‘Pavel was right,’ he thought, ‘I feel it; this evening will not come again.’At last he got up, lighted a candle, put on his dressing-gown, took down from the bookshelf the second volume of Raumer’s History of the Hohenstaufen, and sighing twice, he set to work diligently to read it."
"第六章","CHAPTER VI"
"他们分手后，埃琳娜回到自己的房间，双手撑头坐在开着的窗户旁边。每天晚上，她都习惯地在卧室的窗边坐上十几分钟。她会在这段时间里反思自己，接着回想当天的事情。不久之前，她刚过了二十岁的生日。她个头很高，脸色苍白，肤色较深，弯弯的眉毛下有一双灰色的大眼睛，眼睛旁边还长了些细微的小雀斑，前额和鼻子长得都很端正，双唇紧闭，下巴瘦削。一头栗色的秀发披在细长的脖颈后。她的性格、脸上的表情、明亮多变的眼神、看上去有些僵硬的笑容和都那温柔尖细的声音里都透着坚决和一丝丝羞怯，夹杂着一种令人紧张、任性又急切、仿佛令人触电的特质，事实上，这种特质永远无法吸引每一个人，甚至会让某些人厌烦。","Meanwhile, Elena had gone to her room, and sat down at the open window, her head resting on her hands.To spend about a quarter of an hour every evening at her bedroom window had become a habit with her.At this time she held converse with herself, and passed in review the preceding day.She had not long reached her twentieth year.She was tall, and had a pale and dark face, large grey eyes under arching brows, covered with tiny freckles, a perfectly regular forehead and nose, tightly compressed lips, and a rather sharp chin.Her hair, of a chestnut shade, fell low on her slender neck.In her whole personality, in the expression of her face, intent and a little timorous, in her clear but changing glance, in her smile, which was, as it were, intense, in her soft and uneven voice, there was something nervous, electric, something impulsive and hurried, something, in fact, which could never be attractive to every one, which even repelled some."
"她十指修长，肤色红润，双脚细长，走起路来轻巧敏捷，步子很急，身体略微前倾。她成长的轨迹非常奇怪，起先她很崇拜她的父亲，然后又转而很喜欢母亲，后来变得对父母都很冷淡，尤其是对她的父亲。最近这几年，她对母亲就像对待一位虚弱的祖母一样；在她还小时，他爸爸曾认为她很特别，并以她为傲，而她长大之后，她爸爸竟变得害怕起她来，说她就是一个狂热的共和党人——谁也说不清她的这种性格是怎样形成的。懦弱让她厌恶至极，愚蠢让她怒不可遏，而对于欺骗，她则完全不能接受。无论遇到什么困难，她都会义无反顾地坚持下去，甚至在祷告的时候，她都会经常想起一些训诫的话语。一旦她认为某个人不值得她尊重时——她会很快地，经常是飞速地表达自己的观点——那个人对她来说已经不存在了。她把所有的感情都深深地埋在心里，生活对她来说是很郑重的。","Her hands were slender and rosy, with long fingers; her feet were slender; she walked swiftly, almost impetuously, her figure bent a little forward.She had grown up very strangely; first she idolised her father, then she became passionately devoted to her mother, and had grown cold to both of them, especially to her father.Of late years she had behaved to her mother as to a sick grandmother; while her father, who had been proud of her while she had been regarded as an exceptional child, had come to be afraid of her when she was grown up, and said of her that she was a sort of enthusiastic republican—no one could say where she got it from.Weakness revolted her, stupidity made her angry, and deceit she could never, never pardon.She was exacting beyond all bounds, even her prayers had more than once been mingled with reproaches.When once a person had lost her respect—and she passed judgment quickly, often too quickly—he ceased to exist for her.All impressions cut deeply into her heart; life was bitter earnest for her."
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜信任并聘请来负责女儿学习的那位女家庭教师——可我们看到这位整天无精打采的夫人甚至从未教导过埃琳娜的学习——是个俄国人，她来自一个破产的官员家庭，毕业于一所公立寄宿学校，是一个感情强烈、内心温柔却虚伪的女人。她一生都在恋爱，可直到五十岁时（埃琳娜当时十七岁），她才跟一名小官员结了婚，但婚后不久就被抛弃了。这位女教师很喜欢文学，常会自己写一些诗歌，她启发埃琳娜喜爱上了阅读，但是光阅读并不能满足埃琳娜；她从小就盼望着能做些实事，参加一些积极的慈善活动——那些贫穷的、挨饿的和患病的人们，无不牵动着她的心，烦扰着她，让她的心情变得很沉重；她也会经常梦到他们，会不时向身边的朋友打听一些他们的事情，她细心地帮助他们，带着她满腔的热情，潜意识中认真平等地对待他们。各种受伤的小动物，干瘦如柴的小狗，奄奄一息的小猫，掉出鸟巢的小麻雀，甚至昆虫和爬行动物都会得到埃琳娜的关心与保护，她给他们喂吃的，从来都不会嫌弃它们。母亲从来都不干涉她的这些举动，但她父亲却对此经常感到愤怒不己，因为——照他的话说——她这只是粗俗的好心而已，而且他还时常说，因为家里收留了小猫小狗，结果连个挪脚的地方都没有了。“列诺奇卡，”他会常常向她喊道，“快点儿过来，这里有只蜘蛛在吃苍蝇呢，赶快来救救这只可怜的小家伙吧！”然后列诺奇卡就会急急忙忙地跑过去，解开它被蛛网紧缠的腿脚。“哦，既然你如此地好心，那就让蜘蛛咬你一小口吧。”她父亲会反讽她说，但她却不理会父亲说的话。十岁的时候，埃琳娜和一个小乞丐卡佳做了朋友，常会偷偷地跑到花园里找她，给她带点儿好吃的，送她一些小手帕和硬币——卡佳不要玩具。她们会一起坐在荨麻丛后那片灌木林中的土地上，埃琳娜会带着谦逊的感觉，一边嚼着卡佳的旧面包，一边听着她的故事。卡佳有一个姑姑，她是个恶毒的老女人，经常打骂卡佳。卡佳打心眼里恨这个老女人，总是在讲她将如何从姑姑那逃脱出来，然后过上“上帝般自由自在”的生活。带着崇拜与敬畏，埃琳娜仔细地听着那些陌生的词语，专注地盯着卡佳和她的一切——她那好像动物一般黑色灵活的眼睛，被晒伤的双手，沙哑的声音，甚至她那破旧的衣服——似乎对埃琳娜来说，都是如此地特别，如此地与众不同，几乎神圣。埃琳娜回到家里，一直都在想着乞丐的生活和卡佳所说的那种“上帝般自由自在”。她甚至打算也去弄根榛木棍子，背上行囊跟卡佳一起逃走，想象着她会头戴矢车菊做的花环在大路上流浪，就像她曾见卡佳做过的那样。这个时候，如果有家人进到屋子里，她就会羞怯地走开。有一天，她冒着大雨去见卡佳，把裙子弄得脏兮兮的；她父亲看到她，说她是又懒惰又土气的乡下姑娘。卡佳老是哼着一首有关士兵的有点儿暴力的歌曲，这让埃琳娜觉得全身发热，她的心中又恐惧又兴奋。她也跟着卡佳学会了这首曲子……安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜发现她在唱这样的曲子后非常生气。","The governess to whom Anna Vassilyevna had entrusted the finishing of her daughter’s education—an education, we may remark in parenthesis, which had not even been begun by the languid lady—was a Russian, the daughter of a ruined official, educated at a government boarding school, a very emotional, soft-hearted, and deceitful creature; she was for ever falling in love, and ended in her fiftieth year (when Elena was seventeen) by marrying an officer of some sort, who deserted her without loss of time.This governess was very fond of literature, and wrote verses herself; she inspired Elena with a love of reading, but reading alone did not satisfy the girl; from childhood she thirsted for action, for active well-doing—the poor, the hungry, and the sick absorbed her thoughts, tormented her, and made her heart heavy; she used to dream of them, and to ply all her friends with questions about them; she gave alms carefully, with unconscious solemnity, almost with a thrill of emotion.All ill-used creatures, starved dogs, cats condemned to death, sparrows fallen out of the nest, even insects and reptiles found a champion and protector in Elena; she fed them herself, and felt no repugnance for them.Her mother did not interfere with her; but her father used to be very indignant with his daughter, for her—as he called it—vulgar soft-heartedness, and declared there was not room to move for the cats and dogs in the house.‘Lenotchka,’ he would shout to her, ‘come quickly, here’s a spider eating a fly; come and save the poor wretch!’And Lenotchka, all excitement, would run up, set the fly free, and disentangle its legs.‘Well, now let it bite you a little, since you are so kind,’ her father would say ironically; but she did not hear him.At ten years old Elena made friends with a little beggar-girl, Katya, and used to go secretly to meet her in the garden, took her nice things to eat, and presented her with handkerchiefs and pennies; playthings Katya would not take.She would sit beside her on the dry earth among the bushes behind a thick growth of nettles; with a feeling of delicious humility she ate her stale bread and listened to her stories.Katya had an aunt, an ill-natured old woman, who often beat her; Katya hated her, and was always talking of how she would run away from her aunt and live in ‘God’s full freedom’; with secret respect and awe Elena drank in these new unknown words, stared intently at Katya and everything about her—her quick black, almost animal eyes, her sun-burnt hands, her hoarse voice, even her ragged clothes—seemed to Elena at such times something particular and distinguished, almost holy.Elena went back home, and for long after dreamed of beggars and God’s freedom; she would dream over plans of how she would cut herself a hazel stick, and put on a wallet and run away with Katya; how she would wander about the roads in a wreath of corn-flowers; she had seen Katya one day in just such a wreath.If, at such times, any one of her family came into the room, she would shun them and look shy.One day she ran out in the rain to meet Katya, and made her frock muddy; her father saw her, and called her a slut and a peasant-wench.She grew hot all over, and there was something of terror and rapture in her heart Katya often sang some half-brutal soldier’s song.Elena learnt this song from her….Anna Vassilyevna overheard her singing it, and was very indignant."
"“你是从哪学到这样恐怖的曲子的？”她问女儿。","‘Where did you pick up such horrors?’ she asked her daughter."
"埃琳娜只是看着她母亲，一言不发，她宁愿让父母把自己撕成碎片，也不会说出自己的秘密，她心里再次感到恐惧和兴奋。然而，她和卡佳之间的友谊并没能持续很久，那个可怜的小姑娘患上了风热病，没过几天就死掉了。","Elena only looked at her mother, and would not say a word; she felt that she would let them tear her to pieces sooner than betray her secret, and again there was a terror and sweetness in her heart.Her friendship with Katya, however, did not last long; the poor little girl fell sick of fever, and in a few days she was dead."
"听到卡佳去世的消息，埃琳娜十分伤心，很长一段时间的晚上她都无法入睡。小乞丐和她说的最后那些话一直在她耳边回荡，她幻想卡佳正在召唤她……","Elena was greatly distressed, and spent sleepless nights for long after she heard of Katya’s death.The last words of the little beggar-girl were constantly ringing in her ears, and she fancied that she was being called…."
"一年又一年过去了，时光飞逝，悄无声息，如雪下涌动的水一般，埃琳娜的青春也渐渐地逝去。她表面上看起来很平静，但内心却交织着矛盾复杂的情感。她没有朋友，也没有结交来斯塔霍夫家做客的任何一个女孩子。父母的管束从来都没让她感到过什么压力，十六岁那年她完全独立了，她开始过着自己的生活，虽然这种生活很孤独。她的内心激情澎湃，但这种激情很快就在孤独中消失殆尽了，她像被关在笼子里的鸟那样挣扎着，但事实上她生活中并没有笼子，没有人压迫她，也没有人限制她，但她心里仍觉得难过而且烦闷。有时她也不理解自己，甚至有点儿害怕自己。周围的一切对她来说要么没有什么意义，要么不太能理解。“没有爱的话，要怎样活呢？但没有人值得我去爱呀！”她想，接着她又为自己有这样的想法、这样的感受而感到恐惧。十八岁的时候，她差点儿死于恶性热病，她的身体——天生强健，精力旺盛——整体上受到了重创，很长时间都没有完全恢复，身体最终养好后，她的父亲还不厌其烦地说她的“神经”出了点儿问题。有时她会认为，她想要的东西是任何人都不曾追求过的，甚至是所有俄罗斯人都不曾想到过的。然后她就会平静下来，甚至还觉得自己有点儿好笑，一天天碌碌无为地活着。但是，突然间一股控制不住、难以言明的力量在她的身体里奔涌，仿佛叫嚣着要寻找一个出口。情绪风暴过后，她的心灵之翼就停止了飞翔，但这些情绪风暴真的耗费了她太多心力。尽管她竭尽全力不暴露自己的真实想法，但她心里备受煎熬的苦闷还是在她平静的外表下暴露无遗，不过她的父母总是吃惊地耸耸肩，不能理解她那些“古怪的行径”。","The years passed and passed; swiftly and noiselessly, like waters running under the snow, Elena’s youth glided by, outwardly uneventful, inwardly in conflict and emotion.She had no friend; she did not get on with any one of all the girls who visited the Stahovs’ house.Her parents’ authority had never weighed heavily on Elena, and from her sixteenth year she became absolutely independent; she began to live a life of her own, but it was a life of solitude.Her soul glowed, and the fire died away again in solitude; she struggled like a bird in a cage, and cage there was none; no one oppressed her, no one restrained her, while she was torn, and fretted within.Sometimes she did not understand herself, was even frightened of herself.Everything that surrounded her seemed to her half-senseless, half-incomprehensible.‘How live without love? and there’s no one to love!’ she thought; and she felt terror again at these thoughts, these sensations.At eighteen, she nearly died of malignant fever; her whole constitution—naturally healthy and vigorous—was seriously affected, and it was long before it could perfectly recover; the last traces of the illness disappeared at last, but Elena Nikolaevna’s father was never tired of talking with some spitefulness of her ‘nerves.’Sometimes she fancied that she wanted something which no one wanted, of which no one in all Russia dreamed.Then she would grow calmer, and even laugh at herself, and pass day after day unconcernedly; but suddenly some over-mastering, nameless force would surge up within her, and seem to clamour for an outlet.The storm passed over, and the wings of her soul drooped without flight; but these tempests of feeling cost her much.However she might strive not to betray what was passing within her, the suffering of the tormented spirit was expressed in her even external tranquillity, and her parents were often justified in shrugging their shoulders in astonishment, and failing to understand her ‘queer ways.’"
"在我们的故事开始的那天，埃琳娜在窗边坐了很久，比以往的任何一次时间都长。她想着别尔谢涅夫，想着与他之间的谈话。她很喜欢他，她认为他的感情很温暖，他的目标很纯粹。他还从来没有像那天那样跟她交谈过。她想起了他那害羞的眼神，他的笑容——然后自己也笑了，接着她又陷入思考，但已经不是在想别尔谢涅夫了。她顺着打开的窗户看向外面的夜空。她盯着那漆黑低矮的夜空看了好久，然后起身，将面前的头发甩到脑后，接着不由自主地将露在外面冰凉的手臂伸出窗外，伸向天空，随后她放下手臂，坐在床边，把脸埋在枕头上，尽管她极力地压抑着内心的奔涌的情感，流下奇怪的、难解又滚烫的泪水。","On the day with which our story began, Elena did not leave the window till later than usual.She thought much of Bersenyev, and of her conversation with him.She liked him; she believed in the warmth of his feelings, and the purity of his aims.He had never before talked to her as on that evening.She recalled the expression of his timid eyes, his smiles—and she smiled herself and fell to musing, but not of him.She began to look out into the night from the open window.For a long time she gazed at the dark, low-hanging sky; then she got up, flung back her hair from her face with a shake of her head, and, herself not knowing why, she stretched out to it—to that sky—her bare chilled arms; then she dropped them, fell on her knees beside her bed, pressed her face into the pillow, and, in spite of all her efforts not to yield to the passion overwhelming her, she burst into strange, uncomprehending, burning tears."
"第七章","CHAPTER VII"
"第二天中午十二点时，别尔谢涅夫乘马车出发返回莫斯科。他得去邮局取点儿钱，买些书，还想再借这次返回莫斯科的机会去拜访一下因萨罗夫，和他好好谈一谈。在他和舒宾的最后一次谈话时，别尔谢涅夫就产生了这样的想法，他准备邀请因萨罗夫去他在郊外的公寓里同住。但他并没能很快找到因萨罗夫，因为因萨罗夫已经从之前的住处搬了出来，要找到他新的住址并不容易，那个地址在阿尔巴特路和波瓦尔斯基街之间，在一座带有彼得堡风格、肮脏的石头房屋后面的院子里。别尔谢涅夫找遍一层层房间，先问一个看门人，然后又向一个路人打听，但都徒劳无功。就算在彼得堡，那些门卫都会尽可能地避开游客的目光，而在莫斯科，这种情况就更屡见不鲜了。没人理会别尔谢涅夫的询问，只有一个爱管闲事的裁缝，戴着袖套，肩上扛着一卷灰色的丝线，从高高地窗户里伸出他那肮脏、呆滞、胡子拉碴、瞎了一只眼睛的脸，还有一只黑色的无角山羊，费力地爬上一座肥料堆，转过头抱怨地叫了一声，然后更加卖力地嚼着反刍上来的食物。最后，一个身穿旧外套、脚蹬已磨损了鞋跟的皮鞋的女人同情别尔谢涅夫，给他指了指因萨罗夫的住所。别尔谢涅夫发现他刚好在家。他的房东，正好就是刚才那个从窗户里探出头来、漠不关心地看着到处打听朋友住址的陌生人的裁缝。他租的屋子又大又空，有着深绿色的墙壁和三个正方形的窗户，一个角落里放着一张小床，另外一个角落里放着一张很小的皮沙发，房顶上还挂着一只鸟笼，里面曾经养过一只夜莺。看到别尔谢涅夫来了，因萨罗夫迎出门来，但他并没有寒暄说“啊，是您啊！”或是“天啊，什么风儿把您给吹来了？”他甚至也没说“您好”，只是简单地握了下手，请他坐到屋里唯一的一把椅子上。","The next day at twelve o’ clock, Bersenyev set off in a return coach to Moscow.He had to get some money from the post-office, to buy some books, and he wanted to seize the opportunity to see Insarov and have some conversation with him.The idea had occurred to Bersenyev, in the course of his last conversation with Shubin, to invite Insarov to stay with him at his country lodgings.But it was some time before he found him out; from his former lodging he had moved to another, which it was not easy to discover; it was in the court at the back of a squalid stone house, built in the Petersburg style, between Arbaty Road and Povarsky Street.In vain Bersenyev wandered from one dirty staircase to another, in vain he called first to a doorkeeper, then to a passer-by.Porters even in Petersburg try to avoid the eyes of visitors, and in Moscow much more so; no one answered Bersenyev’s call; only an inquisitive tailor, in his shirt sleeves, with a skein of grey thread on his shoulder, thrust out from a high casement window a dirty, dull, unshorn face, with a blackened eye; and a black and hornless goat, clambering up on to a dung heap, turned round, bleated plaintively, and went on chewing the cud faster than before.A woman in an old cloak, and shoes trodden down at heel, took pity at last on Bersenyev and pointed out Insarov’s lodging to him.Bersenyev found him at home.He had taken a room with the very tailor who had stared down so indifferently at the perplexity of a wandering stranger; a large, almost empty room, with dark green walls, three square windows, a tiny bedstead in one corner, a little leather sofa in another, and a huge cage hung up to the very ceiling; in this cage there had once lived a nightingale.Insarov came to meet Bersenyev directly he crossed the threshold, but he did not exclaim, ‘Ah, it’s you!’ or ‘Good Heavens, what happy chance has brought you?’He did not even say, ‘How do you do?’ but simply pressed his hand and led him up to the solitary chair in the room."
"“请坐。”他说，然后自己靠在桌边上。","‘Sit down,’ he said, and he seated himself on the edge of the table."
"“看，我这里还乱糟糟的没有收拾呢，”因萨罗夫指着地上的一摞书本和文件说道，“我还没能按计划完全安顿下来。我一直都没时间。”","‘I am, as you see, still in disorder,’ added Insarov, pointing to a pile of papers and books on the floor, ‘I haven’t got settled in as I ought.I have not had time yet.’"
"因萨罗夫的俄语很好，每一个单词都发得既准确又纯正，然而他那浓厚的却又好听的嗓音，听起来不怎么像俄国人。因萨罗夫的外国血统（他出生于保加利亚）在外貌上表现得更加突出，他今年二十五岁，身形瘦削，强壮有力，有些弓背，指关节突出，五官分明，鼻尖似鹰钩，头发蓝黑，前额窄小，两眼不大，眼窝很深，眉毛很浓；当他笑起来的时候，那一排整齐洁白的牙齿会马上从那细薄、有力、线条过分分明的双唇下露出来。他穿着一件很旧却很整洁的外套，衣服上的扣子一直扣到喉咙下面。","Insarov spoke Russian perfectly correctly, pronouncing every word fully and purely; but his guttural though pleasant voice sounded somehow not Russian.Insarov’s foreign extraction (he was a Bulgarian by birth) was still more clearly marked in his appearance; he was a young man of five-and-twenty, spare and sinewy, with a hollow chest and knotted fingers; he had sharp features, a hooked nose, blue-black hair, a low forehead, small, intent-looking, deep-set eyes, and bushy eyebrows; when he smiled, splendid white teeth gleamed for an instant between his thin, hard, over-defined lips.He was in a rather old but tidy coat, buttoned up to the throat."
"“你为什么要从以前的房子里搬出来呢？”别尔谢涅夫问他。","‘Why did you leave your old lodging?’Bersenyev asked him."
"“这里租金便宜些，而且离学校也更近。”","‘This is cheaper, and nearer to the university.’"
"“但是现在是假期啊……到了夏天，你何必还要继续呆在城里！如果你一定要搬，也应该选一个乡下的公寓啊。”","‘But now it’s vacation….And what could induce you to stay in the town in summer!You should have taken a country cottage if you were determined to move.’"
"因萨罗夫没有回答他，只是递给别尔谢涅夫一个烟斗，然后对他说：“实在抱歉，我这里既没有香烟也没有雪茄。”","Insarov made no reply to this remark, and offered Bersenyev a pipe, adding: ‘Excuse me, I have no cigarettes or cigars.’"
"别尔谢涅夫拿着烟斗抽了起来。","Bersenyev began smoking the pipe."
"“我啊，”别尔谢涅夫接着说道，“在孔佐沃附近租了一个小公寓，既便宜又宽敞。事实上楼上还空着一个房间。”","‘Here have I,’ he went on, ‘taken a little house near Kuntsovo, very cheap and very roomy.In fact there is a room to spare upstairs.’"
"因萨罗夫仍旧沉默不语。","Insarov again made no answer."
"别尔谢涅夫吸了一口烟，说：“我甚至在想，”他一边说着，一边吐出了一口薄烟，“如果能找到一个人——比如说你，我是这样想的——如果他乐意，如果他愿意住在我的楼上，那该有多好啊！你认为呢，德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇？”","Bersenyev drew at the pipe: ‘I have even been thinking,’ he began again, blowing out the smoke in a thin cloud, ‘that if any one could be found—you, for instance, I thought of—who would care, who would consent to establish himself there upstairs, how nice it would be!What do you think, Dmitri Nikanorovitch?’"
"因萨罗夫朝他看了看。“你是建议我去你在乡下的公寓里同住吗？”","Insarov turned his little eyes on him.‘You propose my staying in your country house?’"
"“是的，我楼上还有个房间空着。”","‘Yes; I have a room to spare there upstairs.’"
"“谢谢你的邀请，安德烈·彼得罗维奇，但我想我现在的经济状况不允许我那么做。”","‘Thanks very much, Andrei Petrovitch; but I expect my means would not allow of it.’"
"“什么意思？”","‘How do you mean?’"
"“我是说我现在的经济状况是住不起乡村别墅的。我没有能力同时租下两处房子。”","‘My means would not allow of my living in a country house.It’s impossible for me to keep two lodgings.’"
"“但是，我当然——”别尔谢涅夫说到这里，又停了下来，“这样并不会让你有更多的支出，”他继续讲道，“让我们好好想想，你这个房间仍然保留，但那边的东西都很便宜，我们甚至可以这样安排，比如，搭伙做饭。”","‘But of course I’—Bersenyev was beginning, but he stopped short.‘You would have no extra expense in that way,’ he went on.‘Your lodging here would remain for you, let us suppose; but then everything there is very cheap; we could even arrange so as to dine, for instance, together.’"
"因萨罗夫还是一言不发。别尔谢涅夫开始觉得有点儿为难了。","Insarov said nothing.Bersenyev began to feel awkward."
"“至少你可以去我那里看看，”停了一会儿，他又说道，“离我家不远的地方有一户人家，我很想把你介绍给他们认识。那里有一位才华横溢的女孩，因萨罗夫，假如你能认识她，那该有多好啊！我在那里还有一个要好的朋友，他很聪明，我敢肯定你们一定会合得来的。（俄国人崇尚热情好客——如果他们没有什么东西来待客，就会向客人推荐自己的好朋友们。）真的，你一定要来。请你一定来和我住在一起，这样最好。我们可以一起工作，一起读书……你知道的，我现在正在研究历史和哲学。对这些，你一定会感兴趣的。我还有好多书。”","‘You might at least pay me a visit sometime,’ he began, after a short pause.‘A few steps from me there’s a family living with whom I want very much to make you acquainted.If only you knew, Insarov, what a marvellous girl there is there!There is an intimate friend of mine staying there too, a man of great talent; I am sure you would get on with him.[The Russian loves to be hospitable—of his friends if he can offer nothing else.]Really, you must come.And what would be better still, come and stay with me, do.We could work and read together….I am busy, as you know, with history and philosophy.All that would interest you.I have a lot of books.’"
"因萨罗夫站起来在屋里走来走去。“我想知道，”他说，“你的别墅每月租金多少钱？”","Insarov got up and walked about the room.‘Let me know,’ he said, ‘how much do you pay for your cottage?’"
"“一百银卢布。”","‘A hundred silver roubles.’"
"“那里有几个房间呢？”","‘And how many rooms are there?’"
"“五个。”","‘Five.’"
"“那就是说每个房间的月租是二十卢布？”","‘Then one may reckon that one room costs twenty roubles?’"
"“是的，可以这么说……但事实上我完全不考虑租金的问题。它空着也是空着。”","‘Yes, one may reckon so….But really it’s utterly unnecessary for me.It simply stands empty.’"
"“也许吧，但是你听我说，”因萨罗夫讲道，果断优雅地转了转头，“只有你同意收取我的房租，我才能接受你的好意。既然像你说的那样，我在那里能节省不少钱，那我就能尽快给你二十卢布。”","‘Perhaps so; but listen,’ added Insarov, with a decided, but at the same time good-natured movement of his head: ‘I can only take advantage of your offer if you agree to take the sum we have reckoned.Twenty roubles I am able to give, the more easily, since, as you say, I shall be economising there in other things.’"
"“当然会了，不过这让我很不好意思。”","‘Of course; but really I am ashamed to take it.’"
"“不这样的话我可就拒绝你的提议了，安德烈·彼得罗维奇。”","‘Otherwise it’s impossible, Andrei Petrovitch.’"
"“好啦，就这样吧，但你可真是个固执的家伙！”","‘Well, as you like; but what an obstinate fellow you are!’"
"因萨罗夫又一次不再回答他。","Insarov again made no reply."
"接着他们就订好了因萨罗夫搬去乡间别墅的日期。他们约因萨罗夫的房东见面。起初房东派自己七岁的女儿去见他们，她头上围着块很大的条纹头巾，认真并有点儿害怕地听完因萨罗夫所讲的话，然后什么也没说，一声不响地跑掉了。后来，她已近临产的母亲过来了，头上也围了条头巾，但她母亲的头巾却很小。因萨罗夫跟她讲他准备到孔佐沃附近的乡间别墅里住一阵子，但这个房间他还会继续租，请房东照看好自己的东西。裁缝的妻子听到这些话以后看上去也有些害怕，马上离开了。最后，那个裁缝亲自过来了，他看上去似乎从一开始就对这一切了如指掌，只是沮丧地说道：“在孔佐沃附近吗？”然后他突然打开房门，吼道：“那你还租这个房子吗？”因萨罗夫再次让他消除了疑虑。“当然，这是一定要确认的。”裁缝离开时，闷闷不乐地重复道。","The young men made arrangements as to the day on which Insarov was to move.They called the landlord; at first he sent his daughter, a little girl of seven, with a large striped kerchief on her head; she listened attentively, almost with awe, to all Insarov said to her, and went away without speaking; after her, her mother, a woman far gone with child, made her appearance, also wearing a kerchief on her head, but a very diminutive one.Insarov informed her that he was going to stay at a cottage near Kuntsovo, but should keep on his lodging and leave all his things in their keeping; the tailor’s wife too seemed scared and went away.At last the man himself came in: he seemed to understand everything from the first, and only said gloomily: ‘Near Kuntsovo?’ then all at once he opened the door and shouted: ‘Are you going to keep the lodgings then?’Insarov reassured him.‘Well, one must know,’ repeated the tailor morosely, as he disappeared."
"别尔谢涅夫走的时候，很高兴自己的提议被接受了。因萨罗夫热诚有礼地把他送到门口，俄国人很少这么做。当因萨罗夫自己在家时，他小心地脱下外套，开始整理那些散乱的文件。","Bersenyev returned home, well content with the success of his proposal.Insarov escorted him to the door with cordial good manners, not common in Russia; and, when he was left alone, carefully took off his coat, and set to work upon sorting his papers."

"还是那一天的傍晚，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜坐在客厅里，快要哭了出来。除她以外，她的丈夫和一个叫尤瓦·伊万诺维奇·斯塔霍夫的人也坐在客厅里，斯塔霍夫是尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的一个远房表亲，他是个六十岁的复员骑兵掌旗官，他胖得几乎都无法移动，肥胖的黄色脸庞上长着一双无精打采的淡黄色眼睛和一对苍白的厚嘴唇。自从退役后，他就一直呆在莫斯科，靠一笔小额资金的利息生活。这笔钱是他那来自一个小店店主家庭、已去世的妻子留给他的。他什么也不做，或许连思考都不会，如果他真会思考的话，那他想了些什么恐怕也就他一个人知道了。他这一生仅仅激动过那一次，显出了些生气。那次他在报纸上看到伦敦国际博览会上展出了一款新乐器，叫做“复样低音大号”，他特别想自己也能有一件，甚至曾到处打听该如何付款、通过哪里购买。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇穿着一件宽松的黄褐色外套，戴着白色的领结，习惯每天吃很多的食物；每当他感到特别为难时，也就是说当他需要发表意见的时候，他就会一边思索着在空中挥舞着右手手指，一边从大拇指晃动到小指，然后再从小指晃回大拇指，同时努力说着：“确实……应该这样……从某种方面来讲。”","On the evening of the same day, Anna Vassilyevna was sitting in her drawing-room and was on the verge of weeping.There were also in the room her husband and a certain Uvar Ivanovitch Stahov, a distant cousin of Nikolai Artemyevitch, a retired cornet of sixty years old, a man corpulent to the point of immobility, with sleepy yellowish eyes, and colourless thick lips in a puffy yellow face.Ever since he had retired, he had lived in Moscow on the interest of a small capital left him by a wife who came of a shopkeeper’s family.He did nothing, and it is doubtful whether he thought of anything; if he did think, he kept his thoughts to himself.Once only in his life he had been thrown into a state of excitement and shown signs of animation, and that was when he read in the newspapers of a new instrument at the Universal Exhibition in London, the ‘contro-bombardon,’ and became very anxious to order this instrument for himself, and even made inquiries as to where to send the money and through what office.Uvar Ivanovitch wore a loose snuff-coloured coat and a white neckcloth, used to eat often and much, and in moments of great perplexity, that is to say when it happened to him to express some opinion, he would flourish the fingers of his right hand meditatively in the air, with a convulsive spasm from the first finger to the little finger, and back from the little finger to the first finger, while he articulated with effort, ‘to be sure… there ought to… in some sort of a way.’"
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇坐在靠窗的安乐椅上，呼吸粗重，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇则将手塞在衣袋中，迈着大步在屋里来回走着，脸上满是愤怒的表情。","Uvar Ivanovitch was sitting in an easy chair by the window, breathing heavily; Nikolai Artemyevitch was pacing with long strides up and down the room, his hands thrust into his pockets; his face expressed dissatisfaction."
"最后他停了下来，摇了摇头。“是的，”他开口说道，“在我们那个年代里，年轻人受到的教育可是不同的。他们不会允许自己不尊重老人的。可是如今，我却只有看着和吃惊的份儿。或许，是我搞错了，他们是对的，或许……但是我仍坚持自己的观点，我生来并不是个傻瓜。你怎样看这件事呢，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇？”","He stood still at last and shook his head.‘Yes;’ he began, ‘in our day young men were brought up differently.Young men did not permit themselves to be lacking in respect to their elders.And nowadays, I can only look on and wonder.Possibly, I am all wrong, and they are quite right; possibly.But still I have my own views of things; I was not born a fool.What do you think about it, Uvar Ivanovitch?’"
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇只是瞧了瞧他，然后晃了晃手指。","Uvar Ivanovitch could only look at him and work his fingers."
"“就拿埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜举例来说吧，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇继续说着，“我一直都无法理解埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜。对她来讲，我不够高尚。她的内心是如此地广阔，以至于能够接受整个大自然，甚至包括最小的蜘蛛或是青蛙，但是却无法接受她的父亲。好吧，这也不是大问题，我明白这一点，所以也就不会去自寻烦恼。不管她是精神紊乱也好，满腹经纶也罢，或是理想崇高，这些都不关我什么事情。但是，舒宾先生……就算他是个杰出的艺术家吧——非常特别的艺术家——对此我不反对，可他竟然对长辈无礼，不管怎样，都可以说他在这方面特别欠缺，说实话，在我的常识里，我实在不能忍受这种行为。我天生不是个苛刻的人，但是凡事都要有个限度。”","‘Elena Nikolaevna, for instance,’ pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch, ‘Elena Nikolaevna I don’t pretend to understand.I am not elevated enough for her.Her heart is so large that it embraces all nature down to the least spider or frog, everything in fact except her own father.Well, that’s all very well; I know it, and I don’t trouble myself about it.For that’s nerves and education and lofty aspirations, and all that is not in my line.But Mr. Shubin… admitting he’s a wonderful artist—quite exceptional—that, I don’t dispute; to show want of respect to his elder, a man to whom, at any rate, one may say he is under great obligation; that I confess, dans mon gros bon sens, I cannot pass over.I am not exacting by nature, no, but there is a limit to everything.’"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜发抖着按了按铃。一个年轻仆人走了过来。","Anna Vassilyevna rang the bell in a tremor.A little page came in."
"“为什么帕维尔·雅克夫利奇还没过来？”她问道，“这是什么意思，我请他，他却不来？”","‘Why is it Pavel Yakovlitch does not come?’ she said, ‘what does it mean; I call him, and he doesn’t come?’"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇耸了耸肩。","Nikolai Artemyevitch shrugged his shoulders."
"“我能问一下你让他来这里做什么吗？我一点儿也不希望你这样做，我甚至不想见到他！”","‘And what is the object, may I ask, of your wanting to send for him?I don’t expect that at all, I don’t wish it even!’"
"“什么‘叫他来这里做什么吗’，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇？他已经打扰了你，或许已经妨碍到了你的康复。我就想弄明白。他到底做了什么让你如此生气。”","‘What’s the object, Nikolai Artemyevitch?He has disturbed you; very likely he has checked the progress of your cure.I want to have an explanation with him.I want to know how he has dared to annoy you.’"
"“我再和你说一遍，我一点儿也不在乎那件事。你有什么好奇的呢……在仆人跟前！”","‘I tell you again, that I do not ask that.And what can induce you … devant les domestiques!’"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的脸有点儿红了起来。“你不用那样说，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇。我从没……在仆人跟前……费久什卡，立刻去把帕维尔·雅克夫利奇喊过来。”","Anna Vassilyevna flushed a little.‘You need not say that, Nikolai Artemyevitch.I never… devant les domestiques…Fedushka, go and see you bring Pavel Yakovlitch here at once.’"
"那个年轻仆人马上就去叫他了。","The little page went off."
"“完全没有这个必要，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇嘴里嘟囔着，然后又开始在屋里走来走去，“我说这些并没有要让他过来的意思。”","‘And that’s absolutely unnecessary,’ muttered Nikolai Artemyevitch between his teeth, and he began again pacing up and down the room.‘I did not bring up the subject with that object.’"
"“那怎么行，保罗必须过来向你道歉。”","‘Good Heavens, Paul must apologise to you.’"
"“得了吧，他要向我道什么歉？你觉得道歉又有什么用呢？道歉全是废话。”","‘Good Heavens, what are his apologies to me?And what do you mean by apologies?That’s all words.’"
"“哎，必须有人纠正他。”","‘Why, he must be corrected.’"
"“那好吧，你自己纠正他吧。和我比起来，他更听你的话。我对他可没有什么恶意。”","‘Well, you can correct him yourself.He will listen to you sooner than to me.For my part I bear him no grudge.’"
"“不，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇，你今天一进门我就发现你跟以往不太一样。我看着你最近瘦了好多。我担心治疗对你没起多大作用。”","‘No, Nikolai Artemyevitch, you’ve not been yourself ever since you arrived.You have even to my eyes grown thinner lately.I am afraid your treatment is doing you no good.’"
"“治疗是一定要坚持下去的，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇说，“我的肝脏有点儿问题。”","‘The treatment is quite indispensable,’ observed Nikolai Artemyevitch, ‘my liver is affected.’"
"正在这时，舒宾走了进来。他看上去很疲惫。一丝轻微的、近乎讽刺的笑意挂在他的唇边。","At that instant Shubin came in.He looked tired.A slight almost ironical smile played on his lips."
"“你叫我吗，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜？”他问道。","‘You asked for me, Anna Vassilyevna?’ he observed."
"“是的，是我喊你过来的。说真的，保罗，你的行为糟透了。我对你很失望。你怎么能不尊重尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇呢？”","‘Yes, certainly I asked for you.Really, Paul, this is dreadful.I am very much displeased with you.How could you be wanting in respect to Nikolai Artemyevitch?’"
"“是尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇跟你抱怨的吧？”舒宾问道，看了看斯塔霍夫，嘴角又挂着一丝嘲讽的笑意。斯塔霍夫转过身去，视线低垂。","‘Nikolai Artemyevitch has complained of me to you?’ inquired Shubin, and with the same smile on his lips he looked at Stahov.The latter turned away, dropping his eyes."
"“是的，他是在抱怨你。我不知道你到底做错了什么，但你应该马上向他道歉，因为他现在的健康状况特别糟糕，并且，我们年轻时都应尊重帮助过自己的人。”","‘Yes, he complains of you.I don’t know what you have done amiss, but you ought to apologise at once, because his health is very much deranged just now, and indeed we all ought when we are young to treat our benefactors with respect.’"
"“啊，这是什么逻辑！”舒宾想着，然后转向斯塔霍夫说，“我诚心诚意跟你道歉，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇，”他礼貌性地弓着身子，“如果我真的得罪了你的话。”","‘Ah, what logic!’ thought Shubin, and he turned to Stahov.‘I am ready to apologise to you, Nikolai Artemyevitch,’ he said with a polite half-bow, ‘if I have really offended you in any way.’"
"“我可没那样想过，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇回答说，他还是像刚才一样避免与舒宾对视，“不管怎样，我还是会原谅你的，你知道的，我并不是一个苛刻的人。”","‘I did not at all… with that idea,’ rejoined Nikolai Artemyevitch, still as before avoiding Shubin’s eyes.‘However, I will readily forgive you, for, as you know, I am not an exacting person.’"
"“哦，那是当然了！”舒宾说，“但是我还得请教一下，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜，你知道其实我哪方面做错了吗？”","‘Oh, that admits of no doubt!’ said Shubin.‘But allow me to be inquisitive; is Anna Vassilyevna aware precisely what constituted my offence?’"
"“不，我也不知道。”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜说，期待地伸着脖子。","‘No, I know nothing,’ observed Anna Vassilyevna, craning forward her head expectantly."
"“哦，老天！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇急忙喊道，“我已经祈祷恳求很多次了，也重复说过许多次，我讨厌这些场景和解释！当一个人在外面呆了很长时间，回到家里就希望能够好好休息一下——谈谈家里的事，家里的人，做一个男主人——不过现在却遇到了这样令人不快的情况。简直让人片刻不得安宁。非要把人逼到俱乐部……或是，或者是别处。一个活生生的人，他是有肉体的，这种特质也有特别的需求，但是现在——”","‘O Good Lord!’ exclaimed Nikolai Artemyevitch hurriedly, ‘how often have I prayed and besought, how often have I said how I hate these scenes and explanations!When one’s been away an age, and comes home hoping for rest—talk of the family circle, interieur, being a family man—and here one finds scenes and unpleasantnesses.There’s not a minute of peace.One’s positively driven to the club… or, or elsewhere.A man is alive, he has a physical side, and it has its claims, but here—’"
"还没说完这句话，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇就快速地走了出去，狠狠地摔上了大门。","And without concluding his sentence Nikolai Artemyevitch went quickly out, slamming the door."
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜在后面看着他。“去俱乐部！”她苦涩地嘟囔着，“你不会去那里吧，花花公子？那里可没有值得让你奉送好马的人——从我的马场选出的马——而且竟然是那两匹灰色的！我最喜欢的颜色。是的，没错，一个三心二意的混蛋，”接着她提高音量说，“你可不会去什么俱乐部的，而帕维尔你呢，”她边说边站了起来，“你怎么没觉到不好意思呢。我原以为你已经不那么幼稚了。看，我的头又开始疼了。你知道卓娅在哪里吗？”","Anna Vassilyevna looked after him.‘To the club!’ she muttered bitterly: ‘you are not going to the club, profligate?You’ve no one at the club to give away my horses to—horses from my own stable—and the grey ones too!My favourite colour.Yes, yes, fickle-hearted man,’ she went on raising her voice, ‘you are not going to the club, As for you, Paul,’ she pursued, getting up, ‘I wonder you’re not ashamed.I should have thought you would not be so childish.And now my head has begun to ache.Where is Zoya, do you know?’"
"“我想她应该在楼上自己的房间里吧。聪明的小狐狸总会在遇到暴风雨时躲进自己的洞里。”","‘I think she’s upstairs in her room.The wise little fox always hides in her hole when there’s a storm in the air.’"
"“好吧，算了，算了！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜开始在自己身上找什么东西。“你见过我那装有辣根的分格玻璃杯吗？保罗，你以后要好好的，不要再惹我生气了。”","‘Come, please, please!’Anna Vassilyevna began searching about her.‘Haven’t you seen my little glass of grated horse-radish?Paul, be so good as not to make me angry for the future.’"
"“我怎么能惹你生气啊，姑姑？把手给我，让我亲你一下。我记得你那个杯子放在你房间的小桌子上。”","‘How make you angry, auntie?Give me your little hand to kiss.Your horse-radish I saw on the little table in the boudoir.’"
"“达尔娅老是忘记把它放在哪里了。”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜说，然后就走了出去，裙子摆动，发出沙沙的声音。","‘Darya always leaves it about somewhere,’ said Anna Vassilyevna, and she walked away with a rustle of silk skirts."
"舒宾原想着要跟她一起出去的，但他听到身后尤瓦·伊万诺维奇那慢吞吞的说话声，就停了下来。","Shubin was about to follow her, but he stopped on hearing Uvar Ivanovitch’s drawling voice behind him."
"“我可不该……就这样放过你……小兔崽子。”那个退役的掌旗官喘着气说。","‘I would… have given it you… young puppy,’ the retired cornet brought out in gasps."
"舒宾上前一步走近他。“那么，我做错了什么呢，伟大的尤瓦·伊万诺维奇？”","Shubin went up to him.‘And what have I done, then, most venerable Uvar Ivanovitch?’"
"“怎么！你是年轻人，就应该尊敬别人。是的。”","‘How!you are young, be respectful.Yes indeed.’"
"“尊敬谁？”","‘Respectful to whom?’"
"“谁？你知道应该尊敬谁。唉，你竟然还在笑。”","‘To whom?You know whom.Ay, grin away.’"
"舒宾双手抱胸站着。","Shubin crossed his arms on his breast."
"“哎，你可是戏剧里的主角，”他大声说，“你就是土地上那最原始的力量，社会结构中的支柱！”","‘Ah, you type of the choice element in drama,’ he exclaimed, ‘you primeval force of the black earth, cornerstone of the social fabric!’"
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇的手指又开始晃了起来。“行了，行了，你这个小混蛋，不要再激怒我了。”","Uvar Ivanovitch’s fingers began to work.‘There, there, my boy, don’t provoke me.’"
"“瞧，”舒宾继续说着，“这位绅士，看上去已经不年轻了，但他竟然还有着如此快乐单纯的想法！尊敬！你这个原始人，你知不知道今天尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇为何会对我这样生气？那是因为我今天早上跟他一起呆在他那个德国情人家里，我们三个一起唱了一首歌——《不要离开我》。如果你听到的话——肯定会被感动的。我们唱啊唱，尊敬的先生——好吧，我觉得很无聊，我感觉到事情有点儿不对劲，气氛有点儿暧昧。然后我就开始取笑他们。我的嘲笑收到了很好的效果。起先她很生我的气，然后就开始对他不满，接着他也开始生她的气，告诉她说，他只有在家里是开心的，家对他来说就是天堂，然后她就骂他没有良心，我用德语朝她咕哝了句“啊呸！”后来他走了出去，而我还呆在原地，他回到了家里，回到了他口中所说的天堂，但他很快又厌倦了天堂，所以他就开始抱怨。好了，现在你觉得这件事该怪谁？”","‘Here,’ pursued Shubin, ‘is a gentleman, not young to judge by appearances, but what blissful, child-like faith is still hidden in him!Respect!And do you know, you primitive creature, what Nikolai Artemyevitch was in a rage with me for?Why I spent the whole of this morning with him at his German woman’s; we were singing the three of us—“Do not leave me.”You should have heard us—that would have moved you.We sang and sang, my dear sir—and well, I got bored; I could see something was wrong, there was an alarming tenderness in the air.And I began to tease them both.I was very successful.First she was angry with me, then with him; and then he got angry with her, and told her that he was never happy except at home, and he had a paradise there; and she told him he had no morals; and I murmured “Ach!” to her in German.He walked off and I stayed behind; he came here, to his paradise that’s to say, and he was soon sick of paradise, so he set to grumbling.Well now, who do you consider was to blame?’"
"“当然是你。”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇回答说。","‘You, of course,’ replied Uvar Ivanovitch."
"舒宾盯着他。“我可以冒昧地问一句吗，最勇敢的侠客，”他开始用一种谄媚的语气说，“你说的这些莫名其妙的话，是你思维能力锻炼的结果呢，还是处于一种瞬间必需的影响，开始一种被叫做声音的在空气中的震动呢？”","Shubin stared at him.‘May I venture to ask you, most reverend knight-errant,’ he began in an obsequious voice, ‘these enigmatical words you have deigned to utter as the result of some exercise of your reflecting faculties, or under the influence of a momentary necessity to start the vibration in the air known as sound?’"
"“我告诉你，千万不要惹我。”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇哼了一声。","‘Don’t tempt me, I tell you,’ groaned Uvar Ivanovitch."
"舒宾笑了笑，然后就跑开了。“喂，”一刻钟过后，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇喊道，“你……给我倒杯酒来。”","Shubin laughed and ran away.‘Hi,’ shouted Uvar Ivanovitch a quarter of an hour later, ‘you there… a glass of spirits.’"
"一个年轻仆人用托盘端来了一杯酒和一些咸鱼。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇慢慢地从托盘里端起酒杯，盯着它仔细地看了很长时间，就好像他不太能理解他手里拿的是什么似的。然后他看了看那仆人，问他说：“他的名字不是瓦西卡吗？”随后他装出一副无可奈何的神情，喝掉了那杯酒，大嚼着那些鲱鱼，缓缓地从口袋里掏出了自己的手绢。但是那个仆人早就收拾起了托盘和细颈玻璃酒瓶，吃掉了剩下的咸鱼，蜷缩在主人的长大衣中，甜蜜地进入了梦乡。但尤瓦·伊万诺维奇却还用着那手指捏着自己的手绢，放在面前，一会儿专注地盯着窗户，一会儿专注地盯着地板和墙壁。","A little page brought the glass of spirits and some salt fish on a tray.Uvar Ivanovitch slowly took the glass from the tray and gazed a long while with intense attention at it, as though he could not quite understand what it was he had in his hand.Then he looked at the page and asked him, ‘Wasn’t his name Vaska?’Then he assumed an air of resignation, drank off the spirit, munched the herring and was slowly proceeding to get his handkerchief out of his pocket.But the page had long ago carried off and put away the tray and the decanter, eaten up the remains of the herring and had time to go off to sleep, curled up in a great-coat of his master’s, while Uvar Ivanovitch still continued to hold the handkerchief before him in his opened fingers, and with the same intense attention gazed now at the window, now at the floor and walls."
"第九章","CHAPTER IX"
"舒宾回到了自己的小屋，刚打开一本书来读，这时尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的男仆小心地走进他房里，交给他一个折了三折的小纸条，纸条顶部被一个厚重的纹章封住了。“我期望，”他看到纸条上写着，“你是一个高尚的人，你不会透露一丁点儿有关早上我们说过的那张期票的消息。你很清楚我的地位和我做事的原则，你也知道那笔钱和另外那件事对我来说无足轻重。最后，为了大家好，还有一些家庭秘密必须被尊重，保持家庭里的平静是神圣的，只有那些没心没肺的人（当然，我并没任何原因将你也算在这些人中）才会去破坏它！（阅后请退回。）——尼·斯”","Shubin went back to his room in the lodge and was just opening a book, when Nikolai Artemyevitch’s valet came cautiously into his room and handed him a small triangular note, sealed with a thick heraldic crest.‘I hope,’ he found in the note, ‘that you as a man of honour will not allow yourself to hint by so much as a single word at a certain promissory note which was talked of this morning.You are acquainted with my position and my rules, the insignificance of the sum in itself and the other circumstances; there are, in fine, family secrets which must be respected, and family tranquillity is something so sacred that only etres sans cour (among whom I have no reason to reckon you) would repudiate it!Give this note back to me.—N.S.’"
"舒宾用铅笔在纸条下面潦草写道：“你别激动，我还不是个喜欢告密的人。”然后把纸条还给那个佣人，接着又读起书来。然而，那本书突然从他手里滑了下去。他看了看红彤彤的天空，又看了看树林中孤立在那里的两棵高大挺拔的新栽不久的松树，想着：“白天里，那些松树都是浅蓝色的，但一到了晚上，它们竟会变成如此美丽的青翠色。”然后，他出门走进花园，心里暗暗希望能在那里见到埃琳娜。他的猜测并没有错。在他前面那条灌木丛中的小径上，他瞥见了她的衣服。他追了上去，等到和她并肩走着的时候，他说：","Shubin scribbled below in pencil: ‘Don’t excite yourself, I’m not quite a sneak yet,’ and gave the note back to the man, and again began upon the book.But it soon slipped out of his hands.He looked at the reddening-sky, at the two mighty young pines standing apart from the other trees, thought ‘by day pines are bluish, but how magnificently green they are in the evening,’ and went out into the garden, in the secret hope of meeting Elena there.He was not mistaken.Before him on a path between the bushes he caught a glimpse of her dress.He went after her, and when he was abreast with her, remarked:"
"“不要朝我这里看，我可不值得你看啊。”","‘Don’t look in my direction, I’m not worth it.’"
"她匆匆扫了他一眼，然后大笑了起来，接着向花园深处走去。舒宾跟在她后面。","She gave him a cursory glance, smiled cursorily, and walked on further into the depths of the garden.Shubin went after her."
"“我求你不要看我，”他说，“但是我想跟你谈谈，我知道这样很前后矛盾。不过这又有什么关系呢？我已经不是第一次这样自相矛盾了。我刚想起来，我还没对昨天我那愚蠢的行为向你道歉呢。你不生我的气吧，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜？或者你还在生我的气？”","‘I beg you not to look at me,’ he began, ‘and then I address you; flagrant contradiction.But what of that? it’s not the first time I’ve contradicted myself.I have just recollected that I have never begged your pardon as I ought for my stupid behaviour yesterday.You are not angry with me, Elena Nikolaevna, are you?’"
"她静静站着，没有立即回答他——不是因为她还在生气，而是因为她的心思已经跑远了。","She stood still and did not answer him at once—not because she was angry, but because her thoughts were far away."
"“没有，”最后她说道，“我一点儿也没生气。”舒宾咬了咬嘴唇。","‘No,’ she said at last, ‘I am not in the least angry.’Shubin bit his lip."
"“多么吸引人……却又冷淡的面孔啊！”他嘟囔着，“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”他提高音量说，“我来给你说个小笑话吧。我有个朋友，而我这个朋友又有个朋友，那个人起初是个正儿八经的绅士，但后来却变成了个酒鬼。一天早上，我朋友在街上遇到了他（注意，那个时候，他们已经不再来往了），看到他醉醺醺的。我朋友竟然转过身背对着他。然而他那个朋友却跑过去对他说，‘我不会生气的，’他说，‘如果你拒绝认出我的话，但你为何要转过身去不看我呢？或许是我今天运气太差了。愿我死后能安息吧！’”","‘What an absorbed… and what an indifferent face!’ he muttered.‘Elena Nikolaevna,’ he continued, raising his voice, ‘allow me to tell you a little anecdote.I had a friend, and this friend also had a friend, who at first conducted himself as befits a gentleman but afterwards took to drink.So one day early in the morning, my friend meets him in the street (and by that time, note, the acquaintance has been completely dropped) meets him and sees he is drunk.My friend went and turned his back on him.But he ran up and said, “I would not be angry,” says he, “if you refused to recognise me, but why should you turn your back on me?Perhaps I have been brought to this through grief.Peace to my ashes!”’"
"舒宾停了下来。","Shubin paused."
"“就这些吗？”埃琳娜问。","‘And is that all?’ inquired Elena."
"“是的，就这些。”","‘Yes that’s all.’"
"“我实在不明白。你到底在暗示什么？是你刚才对我说，让我不要看你的。”","‘I don’t understand you.What are you hinting at?You told me just now not to look your way.’"
"“是的，但是我现在告诉你：你转身背对我让我感觉很难过。”","‘Yes, and now I have told you that it’s too bad to turn your back on me.’"
"“但是，我有那样过吗？”埃琳娜开口说道。","‘But did I?’ began Elena."
"“难道你没有那样吗？”","‘Did you not?’"
"埃琳娜的脸微微泛红了，她把手伸向舒宾。他亲切地握着她的手。","Elena flushed slightly and held out her hand to Shubin.He pressed it warmly."
"“你好像真的认为我很讨厌你，”埃琳娜说，“但是你的猜测并不正确。我甚至都没有想过要躲着你。”","‘Here you seem to have convicted me of a bad feeling,’ said Elena, ‘but your suspicion is unjust.I was not even thinking of Avoiding you.’"
"“哪能啊，哪能啊。但是你必须承认，就算那时你脑海里有上千个想法，你也不会告诉我其中任何一个吧。嗯？我说的是事实吧？我没说错吧？”","‘Granted, granted.But you must acknowledge that at that minute you had a thousand ideas in your head of which you would not confide one to me.Eh? I’ve spoken the truth, I’m quite sure?’"
"“或许是这样吧。”","‘Perhaps so.’"
"“但是，这是为什么呢？为什么？”","‘And why is it?why?’"
"“我也不清楚自己的想法。”埃琳娜说。","‘My ideas are not clear to myself,’ said Elena."
"“那么现在正是和别人说说这些想法的时候。”舒宾接着说，“但是，我会告诉你其实是怎么回事。你对我印象不好。”","‘Then it’s just the time for confiding them to some one else,’ put in Shubin.‘But I will tell you what it really is.You have a bad opinion of me.’"
"“我？”","‘I?’"
"“是的，你。你总觉得我这个人的一切都不真实，只因为我是个艺术家。你认为我不但什么也做不了——因为你很可能是对的——而且也总是虚情假意，你甚至都觉得我连哭都是故意装出来的，认为我是个爱传闲话和诽谤别人的人——所有的这些都只是因为我是个艺术家。我们这些艺术家真是不幸的、被上帝抛弃的可怜虫，总是被人那样想！就拿你举例来说，我喜欢你，但你根本就不相信我能悔改。”","‘Yes you; you imagine that everything in me is half-humbug because I am an artist, that I am incapable not only of doing anything—in that you are very likely right—but even of any genuine deep feeling; you think that I am not capable even of weeping sincerely, that I’m a gossip and a slanderer—and all because I’m an artist.What luckless, God-forsaken wretches we artists are after that!You, for instance, I am ready to adore, and you don’t believe in my repentance.’"
"“不是的，帕维尔·雅克夫利奇，我一直都相信你能悔改，我也相信你的眼泪。不过我总觉得你的悔改和眼泪都是用来令你自己安心用的。”","‘No, Pavel Yakovlitch, I believe in your repentance and I believe in your tears.But it seems to me that even your repentance amuses you—yes and your tears too.’"
"舒宾哆嗦了一下。","Shubin shuddered."
"“好了，我明白了，这就是医生常说的那种无药可医的疾病。没办法，我只能低头屈服了。可同时，天啊，当一个如此崇高的灵魂生活在我身边时，难道我还能如此自私吗？难道我能真的这样做吗?我也明白，其他人永远都不可能看穿这个灵魂，永远都不会理解它为何会苦恼，为何会快乐，它究竟在想些什么，追求些什么——准备到哪里去……告诉我，”他沉默了一会儿说道，“在任何情况下你都不会喜欢上一个艺术家吗？”","‘Well, I see this is, as the doctors say, a hopeless case, casus incurabilis.There is nothing left but to bow the head and submit.And meanwhile, good Heavens, can it be true, can I possibly be absorbed in my own egoism when there is a soul like this living at my side?And to know that one will never penetrate into that soul, never will know why it grieves and why it rejoices, what is working within it, what it desires—whither it is going…Tell me,’ he said after a short silence, ‘could you never under any circumstances love an artist?’"
"埃琳娜直视着他的眼睛。","Elena looked straight into his eyes."
"“我想不会的，帕维尔·雅克夫利奇，不会的。”","‘I don’t think so, Pavel Yakovlitch; no.’"
"“我只想证实一下。”舒宾滑稽又沮丧地说道，“我想以后你一个人散步的时候，我最好还是不要打扰你吧。如果是一个教授，他会问你为什么回答说‘不会’。虽然我不是个教授，而且依据你的观点，我还是个长不大的小孩，但是你要记住，即使是在小孩面前，人们也不会转身背向他的。再见！愿我死后安息！”","‘Which was to be proved,’ said Shubin with comical dejection.‘After which I suppose it would be more seemly for me not to intrude on your solitary walk.A professor would ask you on what data you founded your answer no.I’m not a professor though, but a baby according to your ideas; but one does not turn one’s back on a baby, remember.Good-bye!Peace to my ashes!’"
"埃琳娜刚想挽留他，但想了一下，她也说道：","Elena was on the point of stopping him, but after a moment’s thought she too said:"
"“再见。”","‘Good-bye.’"
"舒宾从院子里走了出来。在离斯塔霍夫房子不远的地方，他看到了别尔谢涅夫。他正急匆匆地走着，低着头，帽子向后掀到了脖子上。","Shubin went out of the courtyard.At a short distance from the Stahov’s house he was met by Bersenyev.He was walking with hurried steps, his head bent and his hat pushed back on his neck."
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇！”舒宾喊道。","‘Andrei Petrovitch!’ cried Shubin."
"他停下了脚步。","He stopped."
"“快走吧，快走吧，”舒宾继续说着，“我只想喊一下你，我可不想耽误你的时间——你最好直接去花园——埃琳娜也在那里，我想她是在等你吧……不管怎样，她是在等人的……你理解这些话的意思吧，她在等你呢！我亲爱的朋友，你知道这是多么令人意外的情况吗？你想想看，到现在为止，我跟她在同一个房子里共同生活了两年，我爱上了她，可是就在刚才，在那几分钟里，我才真正见到她是什么样的，虽然我还不能理解她。我见到真实的她以后太惊讶了，才会放开她的手。请你不要带着那种虚假讽刺的笑容看着我，这可一点儿都不符合你沉稳冷静的风格。好了，现在，我猜你想要提醒我关于安努什卡的事。那又怎么样呢？我不会否认的。安努什卡跟我一样可怜。所有的安努什卡，所有的卓娅，甚至所有的奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂安诺夫娜万岁！你现在去见埃琳娜吧，我则会去——你认为我会去见安努什卡吧？不，亲爱的朋友，比见她还糟糕些，我要去找齐库拉索夫公爵。他被认为是喀山鞑靼人中的米西纳斯，跟沃尔金差不多。你看看这邀请函，看看这些字母：R.S.V.P.？即使来到乡下，我也片刻不得安宁。再见！”别尔谢涅夫静静地听着舒宾的长篇大论，看上去似乎有些为他感到难为情。然后他就走进斯塔霍夫家的庭院里。而舒宾则真去找齐库拉索夫公爵了。那位公爵面带一副极热忱的神情，却说了许多十分无礼的话。那个喀山鞑靼人的米西纳斯微笑着，米西纳斯的宾客们也都附和着哈哈大笑，然而没有一个人真正觉得高兴，宴会结束后，每个人的心情都很不好。因此，当两个不太熟悉的先生在涅瓦大街偶遇之后，可能会见到对方瞬间龇牙咧嘴地笑起来，眼睛、鼻子和脸蛋都皱在一起，然后，他们快速地离开对方，恢复到之前那种冷漠的或是常常交织着虚弱病态的表情。","‘Go on, go on,’ continued Shubin, ‘I only shouted, I won’t detain you—and you’d better slip straight into the garden—you’ll find Elena there, I fancy she’s waiting for you… she’s waiting for some one anyway….Do you understand the force of those words: she is waiting!And do you know, my dear boy, an astonishing circumstance?Imagine, it’s two years now that I have been living in the same house with her, I’m in love with her, and it’s only just now, this minute, that I’ve, not understood, but really seen her.I have seen her and I lifted up my hands in amazement.Don’t look at me, please, with that sham sarcastic smile, which does not suit your sober features.Well, now, I suppose you want to remind me of Annushka.What of it?I don’t deny it.Annushkas are on my poor level.And long life to all Annushkas and Zoyas and even Augustina Christianovnas!You go to Elena now, and I will make my way to—Annushka, you fancy?No, my dear fellow, worse than that; to Prince Tchikurasov.He is a Maecenas of a Kazan-Tartar stock, after the style of Volgin.Do you see this note of invitation, these letters, R.S.V.P.?Even in the country there’s no peace for me.Addio!’Bersenyev listened to Shubin’s tirade in silence, looking as though he were just a little ashamed of him.Then he went into the courtyard of the Stahovs’ house.And Shubin did really go to Prince Tchikurasov, to whom with the most cordial air he began saying the most insulting things.The Maecenas of the Tartars of Kazan chuckled; the Maecenas’s guests laughed, but no one felt merry, and every one was in a bad temper when the party broke up.So two gentlemen slightly acquainted may be seen when they meet on the Nevsky Prospect suddenly grinning at one another and pursing up their eyes and noses and cheeks, and then, directly they have passed one another, they resume their former indifferent, often cross, and generally sickly, expression."
"第十章","CHAPTER X"
"埃琳娜见到别尔谢涅夫后很热情，不过他们不是在花园里遇到的，而是在会客厅里。他们一见面，埃琳娜就立刻而且几乎是按捺不住地与他聊起前一天未结束的谈话。刚才会客厅里只有她一个人，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇已经悄悄地离开了。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜则顶着一条湿毛巾在楼上躺着。卓娅坐在她身边，仔细地理了理自己的裙子，两只小手紧紧地抱着膝盖。而尤瓦·伊万诺维奇此时正躺在顶楼一个被称为“赛尔号”或是“酣睡者”的又大又舒适的长沙发上睡着了。别尔谢涅夫又提起了自己的父亲，他很珍惜这段记忆。那么，让我们也稍微了解一下他的父亲吧。","Elena met Bersenyev cordially, though not in the garden, but the drawing-room, and at once, almost impatiently, renewed the conversation of the previous day.She was alone; Nikolai Artemyevitch had quietly slipped away.Anna Vassilyevna was lying down upstairs with a wet bandage on her head.Zoya was sitting by her, the folds of her skirt arranged precisely about her, and her little hands clasped on her knees.Uvar Ivanovitch was reposing in the attic on a wide and comfortable divan, known as a ‘samo-son’ or ‘dozer.’Bersenyev again mentioned his father; he held his memory sacred.Let us, too, say a few words about him."
"别尔谢涅夫的父亲共有八十二个农奴，但在他去世之前他把他们放了；他毕业于老哥廷根大学，是“光照会”的一员，还是《论世界中精神的转化或象征》这本著作的作者——在这本书里，谢林的哲学观、瑞典堡主义和共产主义被别出心裁地融合在了一起。别尔谢涅夫的母亲去世之后，父亲就立刻把还是小孩子的他带到了莫斯科，并立即亲自负责起对他的教育。他认真地准备每一节课，虽然倾尽全力，但还是完全失败了：因为他是一个梦想家，一个书虫，一个神秘主义者；他嗓音低沉，说话犹豫，经常用一些晦涩难懂、拐弯抹角的语言来表达自己，他也喜欢说一些隐喻性的话语，而且，即使在自己疼爱的儿子面前也会害羞。所以，儿子对父亲所讲的课困惑不解，而且学习上停滞不前也就不足令人为奇了。老人（他当时已差不多五十岁了，他结婚很晚）最终料想事情进行得并不顺利，就把安德烈送进了一所学校。安德烈开始在学校学习了，但他还是没有摆脱父亲的监督。父亲经常会到学校看望他，就连校长也对他的教导和谈话烦到了极点；老师们也很讨厌他的突然来访；他还总是带给他们一些书，就像他们所说的那样，都是些勉强算得上关于教育的书。看到这位老先生那黝黑的、布满麻点的脸孔，细长的手指，还有他那总是裹在身上的窄小的灰色外套，甚至连学生们都会感到尴尬。那时孩子们都没有料到，这个威严、长鼻子、像鹤一样迈着大步的老先生心里会像对待自己儿子那样关心和记挂着所有的学生。有一次，他想到要跟学生们讲讲华盛顿的故事。“充满朝气的同学们，”他开始讲道，但一听到他那奇怪的声音，充满朝气的同学们就全都跑掉了。这位优秀的老哥廷根学生并没有生活在安乐窝里；历史年轮的滚动让他感到颓丧，各种各样的问题和看法让他感到心情沉重。当年少的别尔谢涅夫进入大学后，父亲总是让他去听一些讲座，但他父亲自己的身体却是越来越不好了。1848年发生的事件彻底震撼了别尔谢涅夫的父亲（令他必须完全重写他的书），然而他却在1853年的冬天去世了，当时他的儿子还没有大学毕业，但他已经提前祝贺他获得学位，并鼓励他投身到科学事业当中。“我把火炬传给你，”在去世前两小时，他对儿子说道，“当我有能力时我一直在拿着它，你也一样，千万不能在你生命结束之前让火炬之火变得暗淡。”","The owner of eighty-two serfs, whom he set free before his death, an old Gottingen student, and disciple of the ‘Illuminati,’ the author of a manuscript work on ‘transformations or typifications of the spirit in the world’—a work in which Schelling’s philosophy, Swedenborgianism and republicanism were mingled in the most original fashion—Bersenyev’s father brought him, while still a boy, to Moscow immediately after his mother’s death, and at once himself undertook his education.He prepared himself for each lesson, exerted himself with extraordinary conscientiousness and absolute lack of success: he was a dreamer, a bookworm, and a mystic; he spoke in a dull, hesitating voice, used obscure and roundabout expressions, metaphorical by preference, and was shy even of his son, whom he loved passionately.It was not surprising that his son was simply bewildered at his lessons, and did not advance in the least.The old man (he was almost fifty, he had married late in life) surmised at last that things were not going quite right, and he placed his Andrei in a school.Andrei began to learn, but he was not removed from his father’s supervision; his father visited him unceasingly, wearying the schoolmaster to death with his instructions and conversation; the teachers, too, were bored by his uninvited visits; he was for ever bringing them some, as they said, far-fetched books on education.Even the schoolboys were embarrassed at the sight of the old man’s swarthy, pockmarked face, his lank figure, invariably clothed in a sort of scanty grey dresscoat.The boys did not suspect then that this grim, unsmiling old gentleman, with his crane-like gait and his long nose, was at heart troubling and yearning over each one of them almost as over his own son.He once conceived the idea of talking to them about Washington: ‘My young nurslings,’ he began, but at the first sounds of his strange voice the young nurslings ran away.The good old Gottingen student did not lie on a bed of roses; he was for ever weighed down by the march of history, by questions and ideas of every kind.When young Bersenyev entered the university, his father used to drive with him to the lectures, but his health was already beginning to break up.The events of the year 1848 shook him to the foundation (it necessitated the re-writing of his whole book), and he died in the winter of 1853, before his son’s time at the university was over, but he was able beforehand to congratulate him on his degree, and to consecrate him to the service of science.‘I pass on the torch to you,’ he said to him two hours before his death.‘I held it while I could; you, too, must not let the light grow dim before the end.’"
"别尔谢涅夫跟埃琳娜谈了很久关于他父亲的事情。他在她面前那种尴尬的感觉现在也消失不见了，说话的时候也流利了很多。之后，交谈的话题转移到了大学上。","Bersenyev talked a long while to Elena of his father.The embarrassment he had felt in her presence disappeared, and his lisp was less marked.The conversation passed on to the university."
"“告诉我，”埃琳娜问他，“在你的同学里面，有没有那种十分优秀的人？”","‘Tell me,’ Elena asked him, ‘were there any remarkable men among your comrades?’"
"别尔谢涅夫再次想起了舒宾所说的话。","Bersenyev was again reminded of Shubin’s words."
"“没有，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，实话跟你说吧，我们之中一个优秀的人都没有。而且确实是这样的，到哪里去找这样的人啊！听说，莫斯科大学曾经也是很辉煌的！但它现在却不再辉煌。现在，它只是一所学校，而不是一所大学。和我的同学在一起，我一点儿也不快乐。”他接着又低声说道。","‘No, Elena Nikolaevna, to tell you the truth, there was not a single remarkable man among us.And, indeed, where are such to be found!There was, they say, a good time once in the Moscow university!But not now.Now it’s a school, not a university.I was not happy with my comrades,’ he added, dropping his voice."
"“不快乐，”埃琳娜咕哝着说。","‘Not happy,’ murmured Elena."
"“不过，”别尔谢涅夫继续说着，“却有一个例外。我认识一个同学——他跟我不是一个院系的——但他倒是一个十分优秀的人。”","‘But I ought,’ continued Bersenyev, ‘to make an exception.I know one student—it’s true he is not in the same faculty—he is certainly a remarkable man.’"
"“他叫什么？”埃琳娜充满兴趣地问道。","‘What is his name?’Elena inquired with interest."
"“他叫德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇·因萨罗夫。是个保加利亚人。”","‘Insarov Dmitri Nikanorovitch.He is a Bulgarian.’"
"“不是俄国人吗？”","‘Not a Russian?’"
"“嗯，他不是俄国人。”","‘No, he is not a Russian,’"
"“那他为何会住在莫斯科呢？”","‘Why is he living in Moscow, then?’"
"“他来这边是为了学习。你知道他学习的目的是什么吗？他只有一个梦想，那就是解放他的祖国。他的经历也十分地与众不同。他的父亲是一个十分成功的商人，来自图尔诺沃。图尔诺沃现在是一个很小的城市，但在过去，当保加利亚还是个独立的国家时，它曾是保加利亚的首都。他父亲的生意都在索非亚，和俄国也有些关系。他的妹妹，即因萨罗夫的姑妈，仍然住在基辅，嫁给了当地一所高级中学里的历史老师。1835年，也就是说在十八年前，发生了一件十分可怕的事情：因萨罗夫的母亲突然失踪了，没有留下一点儿踪迹，一个星期之后，她的尸体被发现，是被人谋杀的。”","‘He came here to study.And do you know with what aim he is studying?He has a single idea: the liberation of his country.And his story is an exceptional one.His father was a fairly well-to-do merchant; he came from Tirnova.Tirnova is now a small town, but it was the capital of Bulgaria in the old days when Bulgaria was still an independent state.He traded with Sophia, and had relations with Russia; his sister, Insarov’s aunt, is still living in Kiev, married to a senior history teacher in the gymnasium there.In 1835, that is to say eighteen years ago, a terrible crime was committed; Insarov’s mother suddenly disappeared without leaving a trace behind; a week later she was found murdered.’"
"埃琳娜哆嗦了一下。别尔谢涅夫停了下来。","Elena shuddered.Bersenyev stopped."
"“继续说，继续说。”她说道。","‘Go on, go on,’ she said."
"“谣言说，她是被一个土耳其官员侮辱后杀死的，她的丈夫，也就是因萨罗夫的父亲，查到真相之后，试图为妻子报仇，但仅仅用匕首扎伤了那个官员……然后他的父亲就被枪决了。”","‘There were rumours that she had been outraged and murdered by a Turkish aga; her husband, Insarov’s father, found out the truth, tried to avenge her, but only succeeded in wounding the aga with his poniard….He was shot.’"
"“枪决了？都没有审讯？”","‘Shot, and without a trial?’"
"“是的。那个时候因萨罗夫才刚刚八岁。他靠邻居的接济活了下来。她的姑妈听到哥哥家中的变故之后，就准备把侄子接过去跟她一起生活。他们把他带到了奥德萨市，然后从那里去了基辅。他在基辅整整生活了十二年。所以他的俄语说得很好。”","‘Yes.Insarov was just eight years old at the time.He remained in the hands of neighbours.The sister heard of the fate of her brother’s family, and wanted to take the nephew to live with her.They got him to Odessa, and from there to Kiev.At Kiev he lived twelve whole years.That’s how it is he speaks Russian so well.’"
"“他会说俄语？”","‘He speaks Russian?’"
"“和我们差不多。当他二十岁时（也就是1848年春），他开始想回到自己的祖国。他去了索非亚和图尔诺沃，走遍了保加利亚的各个角落，在那里住了两年，重新学会了家乡的语言。土耳其政府一直都在迫害他，可想而知，他在那两年里碰到了多少危险，我曾在他的脖子上看到了一块很大的伤疤，毫无疑问，曾经是个伤口，但他却不愿意谈这件事情。他也一直以自己的方式有所保留。我曾试着问他以往的事，但却一无所获。他总是笼统地回答我。他非常顽固。他1850年又回到了俄国，回到了莫斯科，打算在这里完成自己的学业，并开始和俄国人交朋友，当他大学毕业之后——”","‘Just as we do.When he was twenty (that was at the beginning of the year 1848) he began to want to return to his country.He stayed in Sophia and Tirnova, and travelled through the length and breadth of Bulgaria, spending two years there, and learning his mother tongue over again.The Turkish Government persecuted him, and he was certainly exposed to great dangers during those two years; I once caught sight of a broad scar on his neck, from a wound, no doubt; but he does not like to talk about it.He is reserved, too, in his own way.I have tried to question him about everything, but I could get nothing out of him.He answers by generalities.He’s awfully obstinate.He returned to Russia again in 1850, to Moscow, with the intention of educating himself thoroughly, getting intimate with Russians, and then when he leaves the university—’"
"“之后会怎样？”埃琳娜打断他的话说。","‘What then?’ broke in Elena."
"“那就要看上帝如何安排了。将来的事情是很难预见的。”","‘What God wills.It’s hard to forecast the future.’"
"埃琳娜好一会儿都目不转睛地盯着别尔谢涅夫。","For a while Elena did not take her eyes off Bersenyev."
"“你所说的话令我很感兴趣，”她说，“他长得怎样呢，你的这位朋友，你怎么称呼他，是叫他因萨罗夫吗？”","‘You have greatly interested me by what you have told me,’ she said.‘What is he like, this friend of yours; what did you call him, Insarov?’"
"“怎么跟你说好呢？在我眼里，他长得十分英俊。但你很快就能见到他了。”","‘What shall I say?To my mind, he’s good-looking.But you will see him for yourself.’"
"“为什么这么说呢？”","‘How so?’"
"“我会把他带过来见你的。他后天就会来到这个地方，然后就跟我住在同一所房子里。”","‘I will bring him here to see you.He is coming to our little village the day after tomorrow, and is going to live with me in the same lodging.’"
"“真的吗？他真的愿意来看我们吗？”","‘Really?But will he care to come to see us?’"
"“我想他会愿意的。他一定会很高兴的。”","‘I should think so.He will be delighted.’"
"“这么说他不是个骄傲的人了？”","‘He isn’t proud, then?’"
"“一点儿也不。我想说的是，看你怎样想了，如果你认为他自负，他确实有点儿骄傲，但并不是你想象中的那种骄傲。比方说，他从不向任何人借钱。”","‘Not the least.That’s to say, he is proud if you like, only not in the sense you mean.He will never, for instance, borrow money from any one.’"
"“他很穷吗？”","‘Is he poor?’"
"“是的，他并不富有。他去保加利亚的时候，继承了父亲留下来的一点儿遗产，他的姑妈也会资助他，但这些钱都很少的。”","‘Yes, he isn’t rich.When he went to Bulgaria he collected some relics left of his father’s property, and his aunt helps him; but it all comes to very little.’"
"“他肯定是个十分坚强的人。”埃琳娜说道。","‘He must have a great deal of character,’ observed Elena."
"“是的，他有着钢铁一般的意志。同时，你也会看到，当他注意力集中的时候，甚至是在拘谨的时候，有一种纯真、直率的特质会从他的身上散发出来。没错，他的坦诚不是我们通常所说的那种做作的坦诚——而是那种人们完全无法掩饰的坦诚……不过，我会带他来见你的，你就耐心地等着吧。”","‘Yes.He is a man of iron.And at the same time you will see there is something childlike and frank, with all his concentration and even his reserve.It’s true, his frankness is not our poor sort of frankness—the frankness of people who have absolutely nothing to conceal….But there, I will bring him to see you; wait a little.’"
"“他不会害羞吗？”埃琳娜又问。","‘And isn’t he shy?’ asked Elena again."
"“不，他不会害羞的。只有那些虚荣的人才会害羞。”","‘No, he’s not shy.It’s only vain people who are shy.’"
"“为什么这么说，那你虚荣吗？”","‘Why, are you vain?’"
"他变得不知所措起来，无奈地摊了摊手。","He was confused and made a vague gesture with his hands."
"“你让我变得好奇起来，”埃琳娜继续说道，“不过告诉我，他没找那个土耳其官员报仇吗？”","‘You excite my curiosity,’ pursued Elena.‘But tell me, has he not taken vengeance on that Turkish aga?’"
"别尔谢涅夫笑了。","Bersenyev smiled."
"“报仇只是在小说中才会出现的情节，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，况且，现在已经过了十二年了，那个官员恐怕早就死了。”","‘Revenge is only to be found in novels, Elena Nikolaevna; and, besides, in twelve years that aga may well be dead.’"
"“尽管如此，因萨罗夫先生什么都没跟你讲吗，关于这件事情的？”","‘Mr. Insarov has never said anything, though, to you about it?’"
"“是的，从来都没讲过。”","‘No, never.’"
"“那他为什么还要去索非亚？”","‘Why did he go to Sophia?’"
"“他的父亲以前在那里住过。”","‘His father used to live there.’"
"埃琳娜陷入沉思。","Elena grew thoughtful."
"“寻求国家的解放！”她说，“这些话是如此地伟大，甚至将它们说出来都令人感到害怕。”","‘To liberate one’s country!’ she said.‘It is terrible even to utter those words, they are so grand.’"
"正在此时，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜走了进来，打断了他们的谈话。","At that instant Anna Vassilyevna came into the room, and the conversation stopped."
"那天晚上，当别尔谢涅夫回到房间的时候，一股莫名的情绪让他感到烦躁不堪。他并不后悔把因萨罗夫介绍给埃琳娜，他觉得他对这个保加利亚年轻人的讲述会给埃琳娜留下很深的印象是一件很正常的事情……如果他自己没有试图去加深这个印象的话！然而，一股模糊、无法言明的感觉隐秘地潜藏在他的心中，他感到一阵悲伤，而且这悲伤之中并无任何高尚的成分。然而，这阵悲伤却没有让他停止阅读《霍亨斯陶芬王朝史》这本书，他拿起书，接着昨晚看到的地方读了下去。","Bersenyev was stirred by strange emotions when he returned home that evening.He did not regret his plan of making Elena acquainted with Insarov, he felt the deep impression made on her by his account of the young Bulgarian very natural… had he not himself tried to deepen that impression!But a vague, unfathomable emotion lurked secretly in his heart; he was sad with a sadness that had nothing noble in it.This sadness did not prevent him, however, from setting to work on the History of the Hohenstaufen, and beginning to read it at the very page at which he had left off the evening before."
"第十一章","CHAPTER XI"
"两天后，因萨罗夫按照约定时间拿着行李来到了别尔谢涅夫的住处。他没有仆人，但不用任何人帮忙，他自己就把房间收拾好了，家具摆好了，灰尘擦掉了，地板也拖干净了。但他在放写字台的时候遇到了一点点麻烦，那桌子怎么都挤不进墙角的空地，但是，因萨罗夫凭借着那倔强的性格和坚持不懈的努力，最后总算把它成功挤进去了。一切弄妥之后，他首先付给了别尔谢涅夫十卢布，然后拿着一根粗棍子防身，出发查看自己新搬到的这个村子周围的环境。三个小时后，他回到了住所。别尔谢涅夫邀请他一起用餐，他说他不会拒绝今天跟他一起用餐，但他已经告诉女房东，请她以后将给自己的饭送到房间里去。","Two days later, Insarov in accordance with his promise arrived at Bersenyev’s with his luggage.He had no servant; but without any assistance he put his room to rights, arranged the furniture, dusted and swept the floor.He had special trouble with the writing table, which would not fit into the recess in the wall assigned for it; but Insarov, with the silent persistence peculiar to him succeeded in getting his own way with it.When he had settled in, he asked Bersenyev to let him pay him ten roubles in advance, and arming himself with a thick stick, set off to inspect the country surrounding his new abode.He returned three hours later; and in response to Bersenyev’s invitation to share his repast, he said that he would not refuse to dine with him that day, but that he had already spoken to the woman of the house, and would get her to send him up his meals for the future."
"“我敢保证！”别尔谢涅夫说，“你不会吃得很好的，那个老女人根本就不会做饭。你为什么不和我一起吃饭呢，我们可以平摊伙食费的。”","‘Upon my word!’ said Bersenyev, ‘you will fare very badly; that old body can’t cook a bit.Why don’t you dine with me, we would go halves over the cost.’"
"“我那点儿钱根本就不够让我跟你吃的一样。”因萨罗夫静静地笑着回答。","‘My means don’t allow me to dine as you do,’ Insarov replied with a tranquil smile."
"那笑容中夹杂着一种让对方无法坚持的力量，别尔谢涅夫没有再说什么。吃完饭，别尔谢涅夫打算带因萨罗夫去拜访斯塔霍夫一家，但因萨罗夫说他当天晚上准备给那些保加利亚的朋友们写信，因此，他请别尔谢涅夫把去斯塔霍夫家的拜访推迟到第二天。别尔谢涅夫早已十分清楚因萨罗夫的个性，但只有在现在，当他们住在一起的时候，他才完全意识到，无论怎样因萨罗夫都不会改变自己的决定，就像别尔谢涅夫自己无论如何都要履行自己所许下的诺言一样，对别尔谢涅夫——一个地地道道的俄国人来说——这种比德国人还要严谨的个性似乎很古怪，甚至有点儿荒唐可笑，但他很快就适应了这一点儿，后来他还发现——如果这种个性不能获得尊敬的话——至少能使大家的交流方便一些。","There was something in that smile which forbade further insistence; Bersenyev did not add a word.After dinner he proposed to Insarov that he should take him to the Stahovs; but he replied that he had intended to devote the evening to correspondence with his Bulgarians, and so he would ask him to put off the visit to the Stahovs till next day.Bersenyev was already familiar with Insarov’s unbending will; but it was only now when he was under the same roof with him, that he fully realised at last that Insarov would never alter any decision, just in the same way as he would never fail to carry out a promise he had given; to Bersenyev—a Russian to his fingertips—this more than German exactitude seemed at first odd, and even rather ludicrous; but he soon got used to it, and ended by finding it—if not deserving of respect—at least very convenient."
"搬来的第二天的早晨，因萨罗夫四点钟就起床了，逛遍了整个孔佐沃，在河里游了泳，喝下一杯凉牛奶之后，他就开始工作了。他有很多事情要做，他现在正在研究俄国历史、法律和政治经济学，翻译保加利亚民谣和史册，收集一些关于东方问题方面的资料，编纂一本供保加利亚人使用的俄语语法书籍和一本供俄国人使用的保加利亚语语法书籍。别尔谢涅夫来到了他的房间，跟他讨论了一阵子费尔巴哈。因萨罗夫认认真真地听着，有时还会发表一些见解，但句句切中要害，从他的见解里我们可以看出，他正在试图得出一个结论，就是他究竟是需要研究费尔巴哈的理论，还是不研究他也可以。然后，别尔谢涅夫转移了话题，他谈到因萨罗夫的工作，并问因萨罗夫是否可以在他面前展示一下。因萨罗夫给他读了自己翻译的两三首保加利亚民谣，然后就焦急地等待着他的评论。别尔谢涅夫认为译文很忠于原文，但没有足够的激情。因萨罗夫很仔细地听取了她的批评。从那些歌谣里，别尔谢涅夫又将话题转移到了保加利亚现在的局势，就在这时，他第一次发现，当一提到因萨罗夫的祖国时，因萨罗夫自身就产生了一种很大的变化，不是脸红或是音量加大——不是的！一股坚强有力的力量和勇往直前的动力在他周身散发开来，他嘴角的线条变得更加坚定，更加柔韧，双眼中闪耀着一丝模糊的、顽强不息的光芒。因萨罗夫不喜欢回忆他在祖国的一些经历，但如果是关于保加利亚的一些事情，他总是会跟每一个人滔滔不绝地讲着。他能够详细地介绍那些土耳其人，谈他们的压迫，谈保加利亚人民的灾难和不幸，同时也谈他们的希望，在他说的每句话中，都能够令人感到到一种聚精会神的思考和一种独特的、强烈的激情。","The second day after his arrival, Insarov got up at four o’clock in the morning, made a round of almost all Kuntsovo, bathed in the river, drank a glass of cold milk, and then set to work.And he had plenty of work to do; he was studying Russian history and law, and political economy, translating the Bulgarian ballads and chronicles, collecting materials on the Eastern Question, and compiling a Russian grammar for the use of Bulgarians, and a Bulgarian grammar for the use of Russians.Bersenyev went up to him and began to discuss Feuerbach.Insarov listened attentively, made few remarks, but to the point; it was clear from his observations that he was trying to arrive at a conclusion as to whether he need study Feuerbach, or whether he could get on without him.Bersenyev turned the conversation on to his pursuits, and asked him if he could not show him anything.Insarov read him his translation of two or three Bulgarian ballads, and was anxious to hear his opinion of them.Bersenyev thought the translation a faithful one, but not sufficiently spirited.Insarov paid close attention to his criticism.From the ballads Bersenyev passed on to the present position of Bulgaria, and then for the first time he noticed what a change came over Insarov at the mere mention of his country: not that his face flushed nor his voice grew louder—no! but at once a sense of force and intense onward striving was expressed in his whole personality, the lines of his mouth grew harder and less flexible, and a dull persistent fire glowed in the depths of his eyes.Insarov did not care to enlarge on his own travels in his country; but of Bulgaria in general he talked readily with any one.He talked at length of the Turks, of their oppression, of the sorrows and disasters of his countrymen, and of their hopes: concentrated meditation on a single ruling passion could be heard in every word he uttered."
"“啊，没错，”别尔谢涅夫在心里仔细考虑着，“试想一下，那个杀害他父母的土耳其官员可能已经得到了惩罚。”","‘Ah, well, there’s no mistake about it,’ Bersenyev was reflecting meanwhile, ‘that Turkish aga, I venture to think, has been punished for his father’s and mother’s death.’"
"因萨罗夫还没有讲完要说的话，门突然被打开了，舒宾走了进来。","Insarov had not had time to say all he wanted to say, when the door opened and Shubin made his appearance."
"他带着一种过分悠闲、和善的神态走进了房间里，了解他个性的别尔谢涅夫立刻就看出来，他又被一些事情刺激到了。","He came into the room with an almost exaggerated air of ease and good-humour; Bersenyev, who knew him well, could see at once that something had been jarring on him."
"“我随便地介绍下自己，”他带着一种既兴奋又真诚的表情说道，“我叫舒宾，是这个年轻人的朋友（他指着别尔谢涅夫）。”“你应该就是因萨罗夫先生了吧？”","‘I will introduce myself without ceremony,’ he began with a bright and open expression on his face.‘My name is Shubin; I’m a friend of this young man here’ (he indicated Bersenyev).‘You are Mr. Insarov, of course, aren’t you?’"
"“没错，我是因萨罗夫。”","‘I am Insarov.’"
"“那让我们握个手认识一下吧。我不知道别尔谢涅夫是否在你面前提起过我，但他却经常跟我谈起你的事情。你要住在这里吗？太好了！请你不要介意我这样盯着你看。我是个雕刻家，我想不久的将来我一定会请你允许我给你塑头像的。”","‘Then give me your hand and let us be friends.I don’t know if Bersenyev has talked to you about me, but he has told me a great deal about you.You are staying here?Capital!Don’t be offended at my staring at you so.I’m a sculptor by trade, and I foresee I shall in a little time be begging your permission to model your head.’"
"“我很乐意。”因萨罗夫说道。","‘My head’s at your service,’ said Insarov."
"“那我们今天做什么呢，嗯？”舒宾说着，突然坐进了一张矮小的椅子里，双腿分开，手臂支在上面，“安德烈·彼得罗维奇，能请问你今天有什么计划吗？今天天气很好，到处都弥漫着干草和干草莓的芬芳，就好像人们为了治感冒而喝的草莓果茶。我们应该出去玩一玩。让我们领着孔佐沃的新住户去欣赏欣赏那数不尽的美景吧。”（肯定有什么事让他心烦意乱了，别尔谢涅夫一直想着。）“哎，你怎么不说话啊，霍雷肖？你就发表点儿意见吧。我们是应该到外面走走呢，还是不出去好？”","‘What shall we do to-day, eh?’ began Shubin, sitting down suddenly on a low chair, with his knees apart and his elbows propped on them.‘Andrei Petrovitch, has your honour any kind of plan for to-day?It’s glorious weather; there’s a scent of hay and dried strawberries as if one were drinking strawberry-tea for a cold.We ought to get up some kind of a spree.Let us show the new inhabitant of Kuntsov all its numerous beauties.’ (Something has certainly upset him, Bersenyev kept thinking to himself.)‘Well, why are thou silent, friend Horatio?Open your prophetic lips.Shall we go off on a spree, or not?’"
"“我不知道因萨罗夫觉得怎么样，”别尔谢涅夫说道，“我想他会呆在这里工作吧。”","‘I don’t know how Insarov feels,’ observed Bersenyev.‘He is just getting to work, I fancy.’"
"舒宾从椅子上转过身来。","Shubin turned round on his chair."
"“你准备工作吗？”他用一种谦逊的语气问道。","‘You want to work?’ he inquired, in a somewhat condescending voice."
"“没有，”因萨罗夫回答说，“今天我可以出去走走。”","‘No,’ answered Insarov; ‘to-day I could give up to walking.’"
"“啊！”舒宾说道，“这简直太好了。快走，我的朋友，安德烈·彼得罗维奇，把帽子扣到你那聪明的脑袋上，看到哪里就走到哪里吧。我们的眼睛里充满朝气——它会引领着我们走向远方。我知道有一家令人讨厌的小餐馆，我们就去那里随便吃一顿糟糕的便饭吧，不过我们会过得很高兴的。走吧。”","‘Ah!’ commented Shubin.‘Well, that’s delightful.Run along, my friend, Andrei Petrovitch, put a hat on your learned head, and let us go where our eyes lead us.Our eyes are young—they may lead us far.I know a very repulsive little restaurant, where they will give us a very beastly little dinner; but we shall be very jolly.Come along.’"
"半小时之后，他们三个来到了莫斯科河岸边散步。因萨罗夫扣着一顶十分奇怪的带有帽沿的帽子，舒宾瞧了瞧那顶帽子，不自然地笑了笑。而因萨罗夫则泰然自若地迈着步子观赏着周围美丽的景色，平静地呼吸着，说笑着，他今天是专门出来放松的，而且玩得相当开心。“懂事的小伙子，只有在星期天才会出来走走的。”舒宾低声在别尔谢涅夫的耳边说道。舒宾自己玩得非常开心，他一直跑在前面，摆出各种著名雕像的造型，并在草地上来回翻着跟头，因萨罗夫的安静并没有让他感到别扭，而是促使他不断地做出一些滑稽可笑的动作。“真是个坐立不安的法国佬！”别尔谢涅夫两次都对他说，“没错，我就是法国人，半个法国人，”舒宾答道，“正像一个佣人曾经跟我说的那样，我是介于享乐和严肃之间的一个人。”三个小伙子在河边改变了路线，他们沿着一条又深又窄的小路走了下去，小路两旁满是高高的、金黄色的黑麦，一个浅蓝色的阴影从黑麦的一侧照在他们身上，那闪烁的阳光仿佛从耳朵的上沿滑过，云雀在歌唱，鹌鹑在欢叫，到处都显现出一片青草的新绿，微风轻轻地吹动着草叶，摇曳着花朵。一阵漫长的散步、休息和交谈之后（舒宾甚至都想跟他们碰到的那个已经掉光牙齿的老农民玩蛙跳游戏，那个老人什么都不说，只是在一旁傻笑着，舒宾让他做什么他就做什么），三个年轻人来到了那个“令人讨厌”的小餐馆，侍者们忙乱地几乎要撞到他们，并且的确给他们上了一顿十分糟糕的便饭，拿给他们的是一种巴尔干酒，然而这些并没有破坏他们的兴致，正如舒宾刚才所说的那样，但是，虽然舒宾的欢笑声最大，但内心的快乐却是最少的。他为不太令人理解、但却伟大的韦涅林的健康干杯，为保加利亚国王库玛和差不多跟亚当同一个时代的赫玛或赫罗玛的健康干杯。","Half an hour later they were all three walking along the bank of the Moskva.Insarov had a rather queer cap with flaps, over which Shubin fell into not very spontaneous raptures.Insarov walked without haste, and looked about, breathing, talking, and smiling with the same tranquillity; he was giving this day up to pleasure, and enjoying it to the utmost.‘Just as well-behaved boys walk out on Sundays,’ Shubin whispered in Bersenyev’s ear.Shubin himself played the fool a great deal, ran in front, threw himself into the attitudes of famous statues, and turned somersaults on the grass; Insarov’s tranquillity did not exactly irritate him, but it spurred him on to playing antics.‘What a fidget you are, Frenchman!’Bersenyev said twice to him.‘Yes, I am French, half French,’ Shubin answered, ‘and you hold the happy medium between jest and earnest, as a waiter once said to me.’The young men turned away from the river and went along a deep and narrow ravine between two walls of tall golden rye; a bluish shadow was cast on them from the rye on one side; the flashing sunlight seemed to glide over the tops of the ears; the larks were singing, the quails were calling: on all sides was the brilliant green of the grass; a warm breeze stirred and lifted the leaves and shook the heads of the flowers.After prolonged wanderings, with rest and chat between (Shubin had even tried to play leap-frog with a toothless peasant they met, who did nothing but laugh, whatever the gentlemen might do to him), the young men reached the ‘repulsive little’ restaurant: the waiter almost knocked each of them over, and did really provide them with a very bad dinner with a sort of Balkan wine, which did not, however, prevent them from being very jolly, as Shubin had foretold; he himself was the loudest and the least jolly.He drank to the health of the incomprehensible but great Venelin, the health of the Bulgarian king Kuma, Huma, or Hroma, who lived somewhere about the time of Adam."
"“那是在九世纪。”因萨罗夫纠正他说。","‘In the ninth century,’ Insarov corrected him."
"“在九世纪吗？”舒宾叫道，“啊，多么地令人愉快啊！”","‘In the ninth century?’ cried Shubin.‘Oh, how delightful!’"
"别尔谢涅夫注意到，在舒宾那些玩笑和胡闹中，他好像在不停地考验着因萨罗夫，他想试探试探他，内心里十分兴奋，但因萨罗夫还是跟往常一样，平静而又直率。","Bersenyev noticed that among all his pranks, and jests and gaiety, Shubin was constantly, as it were, examining Insarov; he was sounding him and was in inward excitement, but Insarov remained as before, calm and straightforward."
"最后他们回到了家里，换了衣服，就按照上午的原计划，准备去拜访斯塔霍夫一家。舒宾跑在前面去报信。","At last they returned home, changed their dress, and resolved to finish the day as they had begun it, by going that evening to the Stahovs.Shubin ran on before them to announce their arrival."
"第十二章","CHAPTER XII"
"“伟大的因萨罗夫马上就要过来了！”他得意洋洋地喊着，跑进了斯塔霍夫家的客厅里，恰巧那时只有埃琳娜和卓娅呆在那里。","‘The conquering hero Insarov will be here directly!’ he shouted triumphantly, going into the Stahovs’ drawing-room, where there happened at the instant to be only Elena and Zoya."
"“他是谁？”卓娅用德语问道。当碰到突发状况时，她经常会说自己的母语。埃琳娜挺直了身体。舒宾带着一丝戏谑的笑意看了看她。她感到有些生气，但却没说什么。","‘Wer?’ inquired Zoya in German.When she was taken unawares she always used her native language.Elena drew herself up.Shubin looked at her with a playful smile on his lips.She felt annoyed, but said nothing."
"“你听到了吗？”舒宾重复道，“因萨罗夫先生马上就要过来了。”","‘You heard,’ he repeated, ‘Mr. Insarov is coming here.’"
"“我知道了，”她回答说，“我也听到了你是怎样称呼他的。我真是觉得奇怪。因萨罗夫先生还没踏进这里，你就已经十分随便地在这里嘲弄他了。”","‘I heard,’ she replied; ‘and I heard how you spoke of him.I am surprised at you, indeed.Mr. Insarov has not yet set foot in the house, and you already think fit to turn him into ridicule.’"
"舒宾立刻变得十分沮丧。","Shubin was crestfallen at once."
"“你说得对，你永远都对，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”他咕哝着说，“但我可以保证，我并没有别的意思。我们今天跟他逛了一整天，我敢说，他是个十分杰出的年轻人。”","‘You are right, you are always right, Elena Nikolaevna,’ he muttered; ‘but I meant nothing, on my honour.We have been walking together with him the whole day, and he’s a capital fellow, I assure you.’"
"“我并没有问你对他的看法。”埃琳娜站起来说。","‘I didn’t ask your opinion about that,’ commented Elena, getting up."
"“因萨罗夫年轻吗？”卓娅问道。","‘Is Mr. Insarov a young man?’ asked Zoya."
"“他已经一百四十四岁了。”舒宾恼火地说。","‘He is a hundred and forty-four,’ replied Shubin with an air of vexation."
"这时，一个男佣人跑过来说那两位先生已经到了。他们走了进来。别尔谢涅夫介绍了下因萨罗夫。埃琳娜安排他们坐下，随后自己也入座了，而卓娅则跑到了楼上，她要去告诉安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜他们来了。跟所有人第一次见面一样，他们谈了些无关紧要的话题。舒宾安静地呆着角落里打量着，但却没什么好看的。在埃琳娜身上，他发现她对他——舒宾——有一种压抑着的厌烦和失望的迹象，仅此而已。然后他又看了看别尔谢涅夫和因萨罗夫，从一个雕塑家的角度来比较着他们的脸孔。“他们都称不上很帅，”他思索着，“那个保加利亚人的脸孔很有特色，线条分明——现在正散发着动人的光彩，而这个俄国人的脸孔倒适合画油彩画，脸上没有线条，只有表情。但是我敢说，一个人可能会爱上他们其中一个的。她现在还没有恋爱，但她一定会爱上别尔谢涅夫的。”他肯定地对自己说。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜走进客厅后，谈话的风格就变为典型的别墅式的——不是乡村房屋式的，而是彻头彻尾的夏季别墅式的谈话。交谈的主题涉及了方方面面，但每隔两三分钟，谈话就会被一股令人窒息的、无聊的沉默所取代。在其中的一次沉默中，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜瞧了瞧卓娅。舒宾明白了她的暗示，朝她做了个大大的鬼脸，而此时卓娅则坐到钢琴前，边弹边唱地展现着她会唱的所有歌曲。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇在门口站了片刻，但他只是拉了拉手指，然后就跑掉了。随后，下午茶准备好了，大家都到了花园里……外面，天色渐渐地暗了，客人们离开了。","The page announced the arrival of the two friends.They came in.Bersenyev introduced Insarov.Elena asked them to sit down, and sat down herself, while Zoya went off upstairs; she had to inform Anna Vassilyevna of their arrival.A conversation was begun of a rather insignificant kind, like all first conversations.Shubin was silently watching from a corner, but there was nothing to watch.In Elena he detected signs of repressed annoyance against him—Shubin—and that was all.He looked at Bersenyev and at Insarov, and compared their faces from a sculptor’s point of view.‘They are neither of them good-looking,’ he thought, ‘the Bulgarian has a characteristic face—there now it’s in a good light; the Great-Russian is better adapted for painting; there are no lines, there’s expression.But, I dare say, one might fall in love with either of them.She is not in love yet, but she will fall in love with Bersenyev,’ he decided to himself.Anna Vassilyevna made her appearance in the drawing-room, and the conversation took the tone peculiar to summer villas—not the country-house tone but the peculiar summer visitor tone.It was a conversation diversified by plenty of subjects; but broken by short rather wearisome pauses every three minutes.In one of these pauses Anna Vassilyevna turned to Zoya.Shubin understood her silent hint, and drew a long face, while Zoya sat down to the piano, and played and sang all her pieces through.Uvar Ivanovitch showed himself for an instant in the doorway, but he beat a retreat, convulsively twitching his fingers.Then tea was served; and then the whole party went out into the garden….It began to grow dark outside, and the guests took leave."
"因萨罗夫留给埃琳娜的印象并没有她想象中那样深，或者可以这样说，他留给她的印象并不是她期待中的那样。她喜欢他的直率、他的沉着冷静和他的外观，但因萨罗夫的整体性格——他那平静的倔强和家常的纯真——并不符合她脑海中那通过别尔谢涅夫的叙述而形成的他的形象。埃琳娜想着他肯定会遇见更加重大的事情，对此她一点儿都不怀疑。“然而，”她不断思索着，“今天他的话很少，这也怪我，我都没怎么问他，下次再说吧……不过他的眼神还挺真诚的。”她觉得自己并没有迷恋他的倾向，仅仅只是想跟他做个朋友，她现在很迷茫，她不知道自己的意中人到底是不是跟因萨罗夫一样，“伟大的人”。最后几个字让她想起了舒宾，她躺在床上面，脸色绯红，生起气来。","Insarov had really made less impression on Elena than she had expected, or, speaking more exactly, he had not made the impression she had expected.She liked his directness and unconstraint, and she liked his face; but the whole character of Insarov—with his calm firmness and everyday simplicity—did not somehow accord with the image formed in her brain by Bersenyev’s account of him.Elena, though she did not herself suspect it, had anticipated something more fateful.‘But,’ she reflected, ‘he spoke very little to-day, and I am myself to blame for it; I did not question him, we must have patience till next time… and his eyes are expressive, honest eyes.’She felt that she had no disposition to humble herself before him, but rather to hold out her hand to him in friendly equality, and she was puzzled; this was not how she had fancied men, like Insarov, ‘heroes.’This last word reminded her of Shubin, and she grew hot and angry, as she lay in her bed."
"“你觉得今天认识的朋友怎么样？”别尔谢涅夫在回家的路上问因萨罗夫。","‘How did you like your new acquaintances?’Bersenyev inquired of Insarov on their way home."
"“我很喜欢他们，”因萨罗夫回答说，“尤其是他们的女儿。她绝对是个好姑娘。她的情绪变化无常，但这种情绪化在她身上则表现得恰到好处。”","‘I liked them very much,’ answered Insarov, ‘especially the daughter.She must be a nice girl.She is excitable, but in her it’s a fine kind of excitability.’"
"“你以后应该多接近接近他们。”别尔谢涅夫说。","‘You must go and see them a little oftener,’ observed Bersenyev."
"“是的。”因萨罗夫说道，此后便一言不发了。回到家后，他立刻就把自己关在屋子里，屋里的灯光一直持续到午夜。","‘Yes, I must,’ said Insarov; and he said nothing more all the way home.He at once shut himself up in his room, but his candle was burning long after midnight."
"刚读完一页劳默尔的著作，别尔谢涅夫就发现有一把小石子打在了他的玻璃窗上。他禁不住站了起来，打开玻璃窗子，看到面色惨白的舒宾正站在外面。","Bersenyev had had time to read a page of Raumer, when a handful of fine gravel came rattling on his window-pane.He could not help starting; opening the window he saw Shubin as white as a sheet."
"“你真是个不可理喻的家伙，你简直就是个夜蛾子——”别尔谢涅夫开口说道。","‘What an irrepressible fellow you are, you night moth—’ Bersenyev was beginning."
"“嘘——”舒宾打断他的话，“我就是想偷偷来看看你，就像马克思见阿加莎似的，我有些话必须要和你单独谈。”","‘Sh—’ Shubin cut him short; ‘I have come to you in secret, as Max went to Agatha I absolutely must say a few words to you alone.’"
"“那你进来吧。”","‘Come into the room then.’"
"“不了，没那个必要，”舒宾回答说，并将胳膊斜靠在窗台上，“这样会更有趣些，好像我们是在西班牙似的。首先，我要祝贺你，你现在形象极佳。而你高度赞扬的那个杰出的人却失利了。这点我敢肯定。公平起见，你可要听好了——下面就是我对因萨罗夫先生的总结和认识。没有天资，一点儿也没有，没有才情，工作努力，记忆力很强，悟性不高也没有特色，但深刻机敏，单调乏味，固执倔强，当关于保加利亚的话题——在我们之间被提起时——他的口才还是很不错的。怎样！你觉得我的评价客观吗？此外，你永远都不可能称呼他的教名，而且也从来没有人这样称呼过他。当然，我一个搞雕塑的，他很不屑一顾，但我却很自豪。乏味，乏味，不过他却可以把我们大家挤成粉末。他忠于自己的国家——不像我们这些碌碌无为的人们，只会奉承民众说，请把生命之水洒向我们吧！但是显而易见，他的任务更加明确，也就很容易让人理解，他的唯一任务就是解放祖国，驱逐土耳其人。然而这些东西对于女人来说，感谢上帝，她们是不屑一顾的。这样的人没有魅力，没有吸引力，跟我们一点儿都不一样。”","‘No, that’s not necessary,’ replied Shubin, and he leaned his elbows on the window-sill, ‘it’s better fun like this, more as if we were in Spain.To begin with, I congratulate you, you’re at a premium now.Your belauded, exceptional man has quite missed fire.That I’ll guarantee.And to prove my impartiality, listen—here’s the sum and substance of Mr. Insarov.No talents, none, no poetry, any amount of capacity for work, an immense memory, an intellect not deep nor varied, but sound and quick, dry as dust, and force, and even the gift of the gab when the talk’s about his—between ourselves let it be said—tedious Bulgaria.What! do you say I am unjust?One remark more: you’ll never come to Christian names with him, and none ever has been on such terms with him.I, of course, as an artist, am hateful to him; and I am proud of it.Dry as dust, dry as dust, but he can crush all of us to powder.He’s devoted to his country—not like our empty patriots who fawn on the people; pour into us, they say, thou living water!But, of course, his problem is easier, more intelligible: he has only to drive the Turks out, a mighty task.But all these qualities, thank God, don’t please women.There’s no fascination, no charm about them, as there is about you and me.’"
"“干嘛要把我给扯进来？”别尔谢涅夫抱怨地说，“而且其他方面你也搞错了，他一点儿也不讨厌你，而且，他跟他的同胞都一直以教名相称——这些我都是知道的。”","‘Why do you bring me in?’ muttered Bersenyev.‘And you are wrong in all the rest; you are not in the least hateful to him, and with his own countrymen he is on Christian name terms—that I know.’"
"“这可不是一回事！在他们眼里，他就是个不折不扣的英雄，但是，坦白地说，我对英雄有着不同的见解，一个真正的英雄用不着能言善辩，他要能像公牛似的咆哮，不过，若当它用角顶的时候，墙壁都会为之震动。他也不必明白为什么自己要去顶撞这个东西，而只是仅仅去顶撞它而已。然而，当今我们可能需要不同类型的英雄。”","‘That’s a different matter!For them he’s a hero; but, to make a confession, I have a very different idea of a hero; a hero ought not to be able to talk; a hero should roar like a bull, but when he butts with his horns, the walls shake.He ought not to know himself why he butts at things, but just to butt at them.But, perhaps, in our days heroes of a different stamp are needed.’"
"“你为何会对因萨罗夫如此感兴趣？”别尔谢涅夫问道，“你来这里仅仅就只是为了告诉我你对他的看法吗？”","‘Why are you so taken up with Insarov?’ asked Bersenyev.‘Can you have run here only to describe his character to me?’"
"“我来你这里，”舒宾开口说道，“是因为呆在家里我心里会很难受。”","‘I came here,’ began Shubin, ‘because I was very miserable at home.’"
"“哦，是这样啊！你不是想再哭一场吧？”","‘Oh, that’s it!Don’t you want to have a cry again?’"
"“你就嘲笑我吧！我来这里是因为我已经毫无办法了，我被失望、苦闷和妒忌给包围了。”","‘You may laugh!I came here because I’m at my wits’ end, because I am devoured by despair, anger, jealousy.’"
"“妒忌？妒忌谁啊？”","‘Jealousy?of whom?’"
"“妒忌你，妒忌他，妒忌每一个人。如果我能早一点儿了解她，如果我知道该怎么处理好这件事情，那么我现在也就不用受这些折磨了——但现在说这些还有什么用呢！最终，我只能一直保持着微笑，做着各种滑稽的动作去逗乐别人，正如她说的那样，一直都在装模作样，我真想把自己勒死算了。”","‘Of you and him and every one.I’m tortured by the thought that if I had understood her sooner, if I had set to work cleverly—But what’s the use of talking!It must end by my always laughing, playing the fool, turning things into ridicule as she says, and then setting to and strangling myself.’"
"“得了吧，你才不会勒死自己呢。”别尔谢涅夫说道。","’Stuff, you won’t strangle yourself,’ observed Bersenyev."
"“在这样一个美丽的夜晚，那是肯定不会的了，不过先让我活到秋天再说吧。在这样的夜晚肯定也会有人去世的，但只会是因为幸福而逝。啊，幸福！每一个从树上投到小路上的阴影都好像在窃窃私语地说：“我知道幸福在哪里……你想知道吗？”我想邀请你出去散散步，然而你现在却沉浸在这优美的散文里。赶快去睡吧，希望你会梦到一些有用的数字！我的心都要碎了。你们，这些尊敬的绅士，看见一个人在哈哈大笑，就会认为他心情很愉悦，你们可以向他证明他若不高兴其实是自寻烦恼，也就是说，他并不苦闷……上帝保佑你！”","‘On such a night, of course not; but only let me live on till the autumn.On such a night people do die too, but only of happiness.Ah, happiness!Every shadow that stretches across the road from every tree seems whispering now: “I know where there is happiness… shall I tell you?”I would ask you to come for a walk, only now you’re under the influence of prose.Go to sleep, and may your dreams be visited by mathematical figures!My heart is breaking.You, worthy gentlemen, see a man laughing, and that means to your notions he’s all right; you can prove to him that he’s humbugging himself, that’s to say, he is not suffering….God bless you!’"
"舒宾突然离开了窗口。“安纽——什卡！”别尔谢涅夫很想在他后面这样叫，但他忍住没有那样做。舒宾现在情绪真的有点儿激动。两分钟后，别尔谢涅夫甚至听到了一阵哭泣声，他忍不住站起身来打开了窗户，外面一片寂静，仅仅听到一个人在远处某个地方——大概是一个经过的农夫吧——在低声哼唱着《莫兹多克大草原》这首歌。","Shubin abruptly left the window.‘Annu-shka!’Bersenyev felt an impulse to shout after him, but he restrained himself; Shubin had really been white with emotion.Two minutes later, Bersenyev even caught the sound of sobbing; he got up and opened the window; everything was still, only somewhere in the distance some one—a passing peasant, probably—was humming ‘The Plain of Mozdok.’"
"第十三章","CHAPTER XIII"
"在因萨罗夫搬来孔佐沃的前两个礼拜里，他仅仅拜访了斯塔霍夫家四五次，而别尔谢涅夫则天天过去。埃琳娜见到他总是很高兴，他们之间总是会有一些生动有趣的谈话。但是一回到家里，他就会变得愁眉苦脸。舒宾把自己关了起来，他发疯似的沉浸在他的艺术当中，有时还把自己反锁在屋里，身穿宽松工作服，浑身上下都沾着泥土；或者是在莫斯科的工作室里呆上几天，一些模特和意大利的雕刻家们，还有他的朋友和老师们过去总是去那里看望他。埃琳娜一直都没能像她想象中那样跟因萨罗夫好好聊聊，他不在时，她总是准备好想要问他的问题，但当他真的过来时，她却怎样也不好意思开口。因萨罗夫的安静始终让她觉得紧张，她觉得自己没有权利强迫他回答问题，所以她打算以后再问。尽管如此，她还是觉得随着他的一次次拜访，她越来越关心他了，不管他们之间到底谈了些什么，然而她却一直都没找到机会跟他单独谈谈——若是一个人很想去亲近另一个人，至少也要单独和对方聊一次天吧。她和别尔谢涅夫谈了很多关于因萨罗夫的事情。别尔谢涅夫意识到埃琳娜的思绪已经深深地被因萨罗夫吸引住了，而且感到高兴的是他的朋友并没有像舒宾说的那样“失利”了。他如实跟埃琳娜讲着他所了解的因萨罗夫的各个方面，事无巨细（当我们想极力讨好某人时，我们会经常把自己的朋友带入到谈话当中，而且几乎从不怀疑，这样可以顺便夸耀一下自己）。只要埃琳娜那白净的脸上染上一丝绯红，两眼圆睁，透露着兴奋的光芒时，别尔谢涅夫的心里就会感到一阵刺痛，就像他以前感到过的那样。","During the first fortnight of Insarov’s stay in the Kuntsovo neighbourhood, he did not visit the Stahovs more than four or five times; Bersenyev went to see them every day.Elena was always pleased to see him, lively and interesting talk always sprang up between them, and yet he often went home with a gloomy face.Shubin scarcely showed himself; he was working with feverish energy at his art; he either stayed locked up in his room, from which he would emerge in a blouse, smeared all over with clay, or else he spent days in Moscow where he had a studio, to which models and Italian sculptors, his friends and teachers, used to come to see him.Elena did not once succeed in talking with Insarov, as she would have liked to do; in his absence she prepared questions to ask him about many things, but when he came she felt ashamed of her plans.Insarov’s very tranquillity embarrassed her; it seemed to her that she had not the right to force him to speak out; and she resolved to wait; for all that, she felt that at every visit however trivial might be the words that passed between them, he attracted her more and more; but she never happened to be left alone with him—and to grow intimate with any one, one must have at least one conversation alone with him.She talked a great deal about him to Bersenyev.Bersenyev realised that Elena’s imagination had been struck by Insarov, and was glad that his friend had not ‘missed fire’ as Shubin had asserted.He told her cordially all he knew of him down to the minutest details (we often, when we want to please some one, bring our friends into our conversation, hardly ever suspecting that we are praising ourselves in that way), and only at times, when Elena’s pale cheeks flushed a little and her eyes grew bright and wide, he felt a pang in his heart of that evil pain which he had felt before."
"一天，别尔谢涅夫上午十一点钟就来到了斯塔霍夫家，与往常的拜访时间不同。埃琳娜下楼来在客厅里招待他。","One day Bersenyev came to the Stahovs, not at the customary time, but at eleven o’clock in the morning.Elena came down to him in the parlour."
"“你想象一下，”他带着一丝不自然的笑容说道，“我们的因萨罗夫不见了。”","‘Fancy,’ he began with a constrained smile, ‘our Insarov has disappeared.’"
"“不见了？”埃琳娜说。","‘Disappeared?’ said Elena."
"“是的，他不见了。前天他就出去了，到现在还没有回来。”","‘He has disappeared.The day before yesterday he went off somewhere and nothing has been seen of him since.’"
"“他没告诉你他要去哪里吗？”","‘He did not tell you where he was going?’"
"“没有。”","‘No.’"
"埃琳娜将身子陷进椅子里。","Elena sank into a chair."
"“他很有可能去莫斯科了。”她喃喃地说道，而且尽量使自己表现得平静一点儿，但同时她又为自己尽量表现平静的举动感到十分地诧异。","‘He has most likely gone to Moscow,’ she commented, trying to seem indifferent and at the same time wondering that she should try to seem indifferent."
"“我可不认为是这样，”别尔谢涅夫反驳说，“他不是一个人离开的。”","‘I don’t think so,’ rejoined Bersenyev.‘He did not go alone.’"
"“那他是和谁一起离开的呢？”","‘With whom then?’"
"“有两个不认识的人——很有可能是他的同乡——在前天吃饭前过来找他。”","‘Two people of some sort—his countrymen they must have been—came to him the day before yesterday, before dinner.’"
"“保加利亚人！你怎么会想到他们？”","‘Bulgarians!what makes you think so?’"
"“这是因为我听到他们在用一种我不懂的语言交谈，但是我知道那种语言是属于斯拉夫语系的……埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，你一直都说因萨罗夫没有什么神秘感可言，还有什么比这个拜访更让人觉得神秘呢？你好好想想，他们来找他——然后就开始激烈地喊叫、争吵，而且是如此粗鲁愤怒的争吵……他也大叫了起来。”","‘Why as far as I could hear, they talked to him in some language I did not know, but Slavonic…You are always saying, Elena Nikolaevna, that there’s so little mystery about Insarov; what could be more mysterious than this visit?Imagine, they came to him—and then there was shouting and quarrelling, and such savage, angry disputing….And he shouted too.’"
"“他也叫了吗？”","‘He shouted too?’"
"“没错。他朝他们喊了起来。他们貌似在相互责备。你要是能见一眼那两个来客就知道了。他们肤色黝黑，脸色凝重，颧骨高突，鼻子很弯，两个人大概都四十岁左右，穿得破破烂烂地，满身灰尘，大汗淋漓，看起来像是工人一样——不是工人，也不是绅士——谁知道他们到底是干什么的。”","‘Yes.He shouted at them.They seemed to be accusing each other.And if you could have had a peep at these visitors.They had swarthy, heavy faces with high cheek bones and hook noses, both about forty years old, shabbily dressed, hot and dusty, looking like workmen—not workmen, and not gentlemen—goodness knows what sort of people they were.’"
"“他跟他们一起走的吗？”","‘And he went away with them?’"
"“没错。他给他们拿了些吃的东西，然后就一起走掉了。那个女房东告诉我说他们两个人竟然吃了整整一大罐麦片粥。而且还说，他们简直就像饿狼似的，争先恐后地吃着东西。”","‘Yes.He gave them something to eat and went off with them.The woman of the house told me they ate a whole huge pot of porridge between the two of them.They outdid one another, she said, and gobbled it up like wolves.’"
"埃琳娜淡淡地笑了笑。","Elena gave a faint smile."
"“你以后就会发现，”她说道，“这些事情都很平常。”","‘You will see,’ she said, ‘all this will be explained into something very prosaic.’"
"“但愿是这样吧。不过你不需要用那个字眼。关于因萨罗夫，他可没有一件事情是平常的，虽然舒宾一直坚持说——”","‘I hope it may!But you need not use that word.There is nothing prosaic about Insarov, though Shubin does maintain—’"
"“舒宾！”埃琳娜打断他的话说，耸了耸肩膀，“但是你得承认他们两个也在喝麦片粥生活——”","‘Shubin!’Elena broke in, shrugging her shoulders.‘But you must confess these two good men gobbling up porridge—’"
"“就连费密斯托克耳在萨拉米斯战争的前夜也吃了晚餐呢。”别尔谢涅夫面带笑意地说。","‘Even Themistocles had his supper on the eve of Salamis,’ observed Bersenyev with a smile."
"“是的，不过第二天就开始打仗了。不管怎么样，如果他回来了，还是请你告诉我一声吧。”埃琳娜继续说道，她准备改变话题，但他们的谈话却被打断了。卓娅来到了客厅，踮着脚尖在屋里来回地走着，这也就在说明安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜还在睡觉。","‘Yes; but then there was a battle next day.Any way you will let me know when he comes back,’ said Elena, and she tried to change the subject, but the conversation made little progress.Zoya made her appearance and began walking about the room on tip-toe, giving them thereby to understand that Anna Vassilyevna was not yet awake."
"然后别尔谢涅夫就离开了。","Bersenyev went away."
"那天晚上，他给埃琳娜送来一个纸条。“他已经回来了，”他给她写道，“脸被晒黑了，浑身脏兮兮地，但他到底去了哪里，做了些什么，我却不清楚，你想不想知道？”","In the evening of the same day a note from him was brought to Elena.‘He has come back,’ he wrote to her, ’sunburnt and dusty to his very eyebrows; but where and why he went I don’t know; won’t you find out?’"
"“你想不想知道！”埃琳娜低声说着，“貌似他想跟我谈谈！”","‘Won’t you find out!’Elena whispered, ‘as though he talked to me!’"
"第十四章","CHAPTER XIV"
"第二天下午两点时，埃琳娜正站在花园里一个小狗屋前，她在这里养了两只可爱的小狗。（一位园丁在树篱下面发现了这两只被遗弃的小动物，因为他曾听那些洗衣女工们讲过，埃琳娜小姐喜欢各种各样的小动物，所以就将那两只小狗送给了她。他这样做一点儿都没错。埃琳娜给了他二十五卢布。）她朝那个狗屋里看了看，确认这两只小狗都活蹦乱跳的，而且窝里也已垫上了新鲜的稻草，这才转过身来，接着她几乎叫出声来，因萨罗夫正一个人沿着小路朝她走来。","The next day, at two o’clock, Elena was standing in the garden before a small kennel, where she was rearing two puppies.(A gardener had found them deserted under a hedge, and brought them to the young mistress, being told by the laundry-maids that she took pity on beasts of all sorts.He was not wrong in his reckoning.Elena had given him a quarter-rouble.)She looked into the kennel, assured herself that the puppies were alive and well, and that they had been provided with fresh straw, turned round, and almost uttered a cry; down an alley straight towards her was walking Insarov, alone."
"“早上好。”他说着，走到她的身边，拿掉帽子。她发现，他在刚过去的这三天里的确被晒黑了很多。“我本来准备和安德烈·彼得罗维奇一起过来的，但他起床洗漱实在太慢，所以我就自己跑来了。你家房子里一个人都没有，他们都在睡觉或者根本就没回家，所以我就来这里了。”","‘Good-morning,’ he said, coming up to her and taking off his cap.She noticed that he certainly had got much sunburnt during the last three days.‘I meant to have come here with Andrei Petrovitch, but he was rather slow in starting; so here I am without him.There is no one in your house; they are all asleep or out of doors, so I came on here.’"
"“你好像在道歉似的，”埃琳娜回答说，“这就大可不必了。我们大家都很喜欢经常见到你。我们就坐在树阴下的长凳上吧。”","‘You seem to be apologising,’ replied Elena.‘There’s no need to do that.We are always very glad to see you.Let us sit here on the bench in the shade.’"
"她自己坐了下来。因萨罗夫就在她旁边坐着。","She seated herself.Insarov sat down near her."
"“我想你前些日子没在家吧？”她开口说道。","‘You have not been at home these last days, I think?’ she began."
"“是的，”他回答说，“我出去了几天。是安德烈·彼得罗维奇告诉你的吧？”","‘No,’ he answered.‘I went away.Did Andrei Petrovitch tell you?’"
"因萨罗夫看着她笑了笑，然后就开始摆弄手里的帽子。当他笑起来时，眼睛里就会闪闪发光，嘴角也向上翘起，这让他看起来很亲切。","Insarov looked at her, smiled, and began playing with his cap.When he smiled, his eyes blinked, and his lips puckered up, which gave him a very good-humoured appearance."
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇可能也告诉过你我是和一些不起眼的人一起离开的吧。”他仍旧笑着说。","‘Andrei Petrovitch most likely told you too that I went away with some—unattractive people,’ he said, still smiling."
"埃琳娜感到有点儿尴尬，但她很快就觉得她应该跟因萨罗夫说实话。","Elena was a little confused, but she felt at once that Insarov must always be told the truth."
"“是的。”她直接说道。","‘Yes,’ she said decisively."
"“那你觉得我这个人怎么样呢？”他突然问道。","‘What did you think of me?’ he asked her suddenly."
"埃琳娜抬眼看着他。","Elena raised her eyes to him."
"“我觉得，”她说，“我觉得你一直都很清楚自己在做什么，而且你从来都不会做坏事。”","‘I thought,’ she said, ‘I thought that you always know what you’re doing, and you are incapable of doing anything wrong.’"
"“哦——谢谢你这么夸我。你知道吗，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”他说道，亲密地向她靠了靠，“我有一些同胞在这边，当中有些人并没有读过多少书，但我们却都衷心坚持着同一个梦想。令人遗憾的是，大家相处总会产生矛盾，而他们都认识我，信任我，所以就让我过去解决纠纷。我就去了。”","‘Well—thanks for that.You see, Elena Nikolaevna,’ he began, coming closer to her in a confidential way, ‘there is a little family of our people here; among us there are men of little culture; but all are warmly devoted to the common cause.Unluckily, one can never get on without dissensions, and they all know me, and trust me; so they sent for me to settle a dispute.I went.’"
"“那地方离这里很远吗？”","‘Was it far from here?’"
"“我走了大概有五十多英里路才到达特罗伊茨克区。我们有一些同胞住在那里的修道院附近。不管怎样，我没有白跑这一趟，我顺利地解决了纠纷。”","‘I went about fifty miles, to the Troitsky district.There, near the monastery, there are some of our people.At any rate, my trouble was not thrown away; I settled the matter.’"
"“你遇到困难了吗？”","‘And had you much difficulty?’"
"“没错。有一个人实在太固执了。他不愿意退钱。”","‘Yes.One was obstinate through everything.He did not want to give back the money.’"
"“什么？你们是因为钱吵起来的吗？”","‘What?Was the dispute over money?’"
"“是的，只是为一小笔钱而已。那你以为是什么呢？”","‘Yes; and a small sum of money too.What did you suppose?’"
"“你就因为这点儿小事跑了五十多英里路啊？还浪费了三天时间？”","‘And you travelled over fifty miles for such trifling matters?Wasted three days?’"
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，当关系到我的同胞们时，那些事情对我来说就不是小事情了。在这种状况下，如果我拒绝就太不厚道了。我看到连遗弃的小狗你都会去帮助它们，你真的是很善良。至于我花掉的时间，那没什么的，我以后会把它们补回来。我们的时间并不是属于我们自己的。”","‘They are not trifling matters, Elena Nikolaevna, when my countrymen are involved.It would be wicked to refuse in such cases.I see here that you don’t refuse help even to puppies, and I think well of you for it.And as for the time I have lost, that’s no great harm; I will make it up later.Our time does not belong to us.’"
"“那是属于谁的？”","‘To whom does it belong then?’"
"“啊，当然是属于那些需要我们帮助的人们。我一时冲动把事情都告诉了你，因为我很在乎你的看法。我能想象到安德烈·彼得罗维奇说的话让你对此有多好奇！”","‘Why, to all who need us.I have told you all this on the spur of the moment, because I value your good opinion.I can fancy how Andrei Petrovitch must have made you wonder!’"
"“在乎我的看法，”埃琳娜低声说，“为什么呢？”","‘You value my good opinion,’ said Elena, in an undertone, ‘why?’"
"因萨罗夫又笑了笑。","Insarov smiled again."
"“因为你是一位好女孩，没有一点儿贵族架子……就是这些。”","‘Because you are a good young lady, not an aristocrat… that’s all.’"
"接着两人陷入了短暂的沉默。","A short silence followed."
"“德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇，”埃琳娜说，“你知道这是你第一次对我如此坦诚吗？”","‘Dmitri Nikanorovitch,’ said Elena, ’do you know that this is the first time you have been so unreserved with me?’"
"“此话怎讲？我觉得在你面前，我一直都是怎么想就怎么说。”","‘How’s that?I think I have always said everything I thought to you.’"
"“不，这可是第一次，我很高兴，我准备以后也要坦诚地面对你。我可以吗？”","‘No, this is the first time, and I am very glad, and I too want to be open with you. May I?’"
"因萨罗夫笑着说：”当然可以。“","Insarov began to laugh and said: ‘You may.’"
"“我警告你哦，我的好奇心可是很强的。”","‘I warn you I am very inquisitive.’"
"“没事，你就问吧。”","‘Never mind, tell me.’"
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇给我讲了好多关于你的事情，还包括你小时候的事情。我知道有一件事，一件很可怕的事情……我知道后来你又回到了自己的祖国……如果你觉得我的问题冒犯了你，看在上帝的份上，你就不要回答我了，不过有一个问题一直困扰着我……告诉我，你有没有见到那个人？”","‘Andrei Petrovitch has told me a great deal of your life, of your youth.I know of one event, one awful event….I know you travelled afterwards in your own country….Don’t answer me for goodness sake, if you think my question indiscreet, but I am fretted by one idea….Tell me, did you meet that man?’"
"埃琳娜差点儿喘不上气来。她为自己的鲁莽感到羞愧和惊慌。因萨罗夫目不转睛地看着她，微微皱了皱眉，并用手指摩挲着下巴。","Elena caught her breath.She felt both shame and dismay at her own audacity.Insarov looked at her intently, slightly knitting his brows, and stroking his chin with his fingers."
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”他最后开口说道，声音比往日低沉了许多，这让埃琳娜感到十分恐怖，“我知道你说的那人是指谁。没有，我没有见到他，感谢上帝没有让我碰到他！我也没有试图去找他。我没去找他，不是因为我觉得自己没有权利杀掉他——我可以毫不犹豫地杀掉他——而是因为现在还不到时机，现在不是讲个人恩怨的时候，我们要顾全大局，从整个民族的利益出发——或者这样讲也不是很准确——我们现在要考虑的是民族的解放。一个是会妨碍另一个的。时机到了的时候，那个也会实现的……那个也会实现的。”他重复着，并且晃着脑袋。","‘Elena Nikolaevna,’ he began at last, and his voice was much lower than usual, which almost frightened Elena, ‘I understand what man you are referring to.No, I did not meet him, and thank God I did not!I did not try to find him.I did not try to find him: not because I did not think I had a right to kill him—I would kill him with a very easy conscience—but because now is not the time for private revenge, when we are concerned with the general national vengeance—or no, that is not the right word—when we are concerned with the liberation of a people.The one would be a hindrance to the other.In its own time that, too, will come… that too will come,’ he repeated, and he shook his head."
"埃琳娜从侧面看了看他。","Elena looked at him from the side."
"“你很爱自己的祖国吗？”她谨慎地问道。","‘You love your country very dearly?’ she articulated timidly."
"“这还需要时间来证明，”他回答说，“当我们中间有人为祖国而牺牲时，那么这人才真正算得上热爱自己的祖国。”","‘That remains to be shown,’ he answered.‘When one of us dies for her, then one can say he loved his country.’"
"“所以说，如果你以后回不了保加利亚了，”埃琳娜继续说道，“那你在俄国应该会很不开心吧？”","‘So that, if you were cut off all chance of returning to Bulgaria,’ continued Elena, ‘would you be very unhappy in Russia?’"
"因萨罗夫低下了头。","Insarov looked down."
"“我想我会崩溃的。”他说。","‘I think I could not bear that,’ he said."
"“告诉我，”埃琳娜又开口说道，“保加利亚语很难学吗？”","‘Tell me,’ Elena began again, ‘is it difficult to learn Bulgarian?’"
"“一点儿都不。如果一个俄国人不会讲保加利亚语，那么这就是一件令他丢脸的事。一个俄国人应该了解所有斯拉夫语系的方言。我给你拿点儿保加利亚的书籍吧？你就会发现保加利亚语其实是很简单的。我们有许多好听的民谣！差不多和塞尔维亚歌谣一样。稍等片刻，我翻译一首给你听听。这首是关于……但是，你至少了解过一些我们的历史吧？”","‘Not at all.It’s a disgrace to a Russian not to know Bulgarian.A Russian ought to know all the Slavonic dialects.Would you like me to bring you some Bulgarian books?You will see how easy it is.What ballads we have! equal to the Servian.But stop a minute, I will translate to you one of them.It is about…But you know a little of our history at least, don’t you?’"
"“不，我什么都不知道。”埃琳娜回答说。","‘No, I know nothing of it,’ answered Elena."
"“你等我一下，我给你拿本书过来。你至少可以从那本书里了解一些比较重大的历史事件。现在请听这首民谣……不过我最好还是给你一篇译文吧。我敢肯定你一定会喜欢上我们的，因为你同情所有那些被压迫的人们。如果你知道我们的土地是何等富饶那该多好啊！但是，它现在已经饱受摧残，饱经掠夺，”他一边说着，一边不由自主地挥动手臂，脸色沉了下来，“他们掠夺了我们所有的东西，所有的：我们的教堂，我们的法律，我们的土地，禽兽不如的土耳其人像驱逐牲口似的对待我们，残害我们——”","‘Wait a little and I will bring you a book.You will learn the principal facts at least from it.Listen to the ballad then….But I had better bring you a written translation, though.I am sure you will love us, you love all the oppressed.If you knew what a land of plenty ours is!And, meanwhile, it has been downtrodden, it has been ravaged,’ he went on, with an involuntary movement of his arm, and his face darkened; ‘we have been robbed of everything; everything, our churches, our laws, our lands; the unclean Turks drive us like cattle, butcher us—’"
"“德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇！”埃琳娜叫了起来。","‘Dmitri Nikanorovitch!’ cried Elena."
"他停了下来。","He stopped."
"“对不起。一谈起这些，我就冷静不下来。但是你刚才问我是否热爱自己的祖国。除此之外，一个人还有什么可热爱的呢？还有什么能让我们坚定目标，还有什么能让我们排除万难，还有什么能让我们——除了上帝——坚持自己的信念？而且还是在祖国需要我们的时候。……你想想，在保加利亚，即使是最贫穷的农民，最可怜的乞丐，都和我一样拥有一个共同的希望。我们都有一个共同的目标。你以后会明白这将给我们带来多大的力量，多大的信心！”","‘I beg your pardon.I can’t speak of this coolly.But you asked me just now whether I love my country.What else can one love on earth?What is the one thing unchanging, what is above all doubts, what is it—next to God—one must believe in?And when that country needs.… Think; the poorest peasant, the poorest beggar in Bulgaria, and I have the same desire.All of us have one aim.You can understand what strength, what confidence that gives!’"
"因萨罗夫沉默了一小会儿，又开始谈起了保加利亚。埃琳娜专心致志、心情沉重地听着他的诉说。当他停下来之后，她再次问了他：","Insarov was silent for an instant; then he began again to talk of Bulgaria.Elena listened to him with absorbed, profound, and mournful attention.When he had finished, she asked him once more:"
"“无论如何你都不会留在俄国吗？”","‘Then you would not stay in Russia for anything?’"
"当他离开的时候，她盯着他的背影看了很长时间。就在那天，他在她眼里彻底地脱胎换骨了。当她跟着他穿过花园回去的时候，他已经不是她两个小时之前见到的那个因萨罗夫了。","And when he went away, for a long time she gazed after him.On that day he had become a different man for her.When she walked back with him through the garden, he was no longer the man she had met two hours before."
"那天过后，他过来的次数就越来越多了，而别尔谢涅夫则只是偶尔过来一次。一种莫名的感情开始在他们之间滋长，他们两个都意识到了这种感情，但他们却没有声张，他们害怕去面对这种感情。就这样，一个月过去了。","From that day he began to come more and more often, and Bersenyev less and less often.A strange feeling began to grow up between the two friends, of which they were both conscious, but to which they could not give a name, and which they feared to analyse.In this way a month passed."
"第十五章","CHAPTER XV"
"就像读者您早已经知道的那样，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜喜欢呆在家里，不过有时她会冒出一些让人很稀奇古怪的想法：一些不同寻常的快乐之事，越是惹麻烦，需要做的准备和安排越多，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜也就越激动，她获得的快乐也越多。如果她在冬天产生这种想法，她就会提前预定好两三个排在一起的包厢，然后邀请所有熟人去看戏或者是去参加假面舞会，假如是在夏天，她就会驾车到城外去游玩，走得越远越好。到了第二天，她就会抱怨说自己头疼，呻吟着，一直躺在床上，但两个月过后，她脑海里就会又蹦出一些“稀奇古怪”的想法来。现在的情况就是这样。她无意中听人说察里津诺的景色很迷人，然后就立马决定后天要去察里津诺游玩。全家人都陷入了忙碌中；一个信使飞奔去莫斯科接尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇；和他同去的还有去买酒、馅饼和其他粮食的管家；舒宾被派去租一辆敞篷马车——单单一辆四轮马车是不够用的，而且还要预备几匹备用的马；一封信被两次送到了别尔谢涅夫和因萨罗夫的别墅，那是卓娅写的请帖，第一次是用俄语写的，第二次是用法语写的；安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜自己则忙着准备她和女儿旅行用的服饰。在此期间，这件快乐之事差点儿成了一场悲剧。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇从莫斯科回来之后就一直精神不振，脾气乖戾，行为异常。他还在和奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂安诺夫娜生气，当他得知出游的计划时，他断然拒绝前往，还说从孔佐沃到莫斯科，然后再从莫斯科到察里津诺，最后再原路返回简直就是一出闹剧。“事实上，”他继续说道，“只要有人能让我信服，在地球上，有一个地方就是比另一个地方让人快乐，那样的话我就去。”当然，谁也没法跟他保证这点，没有了丈夫的陪同，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜就准备要放弃这次出游的计划，但她突然想到了尤瓦·伊万诺维奇，所以就悲伤地让人把他请过来，口中说着：“即使快被淹死，也要抓住最后一根稻草。”他们把他喊了起来，他来到楼下安静地听完安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的建议，动了动手指，竟然同意了。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜亲了亲他的脸颊，直呼他为亲爱的，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇则轻蔑地笑着说：“真是愚蠢！”（他喜欢偶尔说几句时髦的法语。）第二天一大早，坐满乘客的大马车和那个敞篷的四轮马车就从斯塔霍夫家的院子里浩浩荡荡地出发了。小姐们、别尔谢涅夫，还有一个女仆坐在那个大马车上，因萨罗夫坐在前面赶车的位置上，而尤瓦·伊万诺维奇和舒宾则坐在了敞篷马车上。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇示意让舒宾坐到自己身边，他知道舒宾一路上会取笑他，然而，这个“老古董”和这个年轻艺术家之间存在一种奇怪的吸引，一种无所顾忌的直率。但是，这次，舒宾却没有取笑过他那胖胖的朋友，他看上去不知在想什么，沉默不语，表现得很绅士。","Anna Vassilyevna, as the reader knows already, liked staying at home; but at times she manifested, quite unexpectedly, an irresistible longing for something out of the common, some extraordinary partie du plaisir, and the more troublesome the partie du plaisir was, the more preparations and arrangements it required, and the greater Anna Vassilyevna’s own agitation over it, the more pleasure it gave her.If this mood came upon her in winter, she would order two or three boxes to be taken side by side, and, inviting all her acquaintances, would set off to the theatre or even to a masquerade; in summer she would drive for a trip out of town to some spot as far off as possible.The next day she would complain of a headache, groan and keep her bed; but within two months the same craving for something ‘out of the common’ would break out in her again.That was just what happened now.Some one chanced to refer to the beautiful scenery of Tsaritsino before her, and Anna Vassilyevna suddenly announced an intention of driving to Tsaritsino the day after tomorrow.The household was thrown into a state of bustle; a messenger galloped off to Moscow for Nikolai Artemyevitch; with him galloped the butler to buy wines, pies, and all sorts of provisions; Shubin was commissioned to hire an open carriage—the coach alone was not enough—and to order relays of horses to be ready; a page was twice despatched to Bersenyev and Insarov with two different notes of invitation, written by Zoya, the first in Russian, the second in French; Anna Vassilyevna herself was busy over the dresses of the young ladies for the expedition.Meanwhile the partie du plaisir was very near coming to grief.Nikolai Artemyevitch arrived from Moscow in a sour, ill-natured, frondeurish frame of mind.He was still sulky with Augustina Christianovna; and when he heard what the plan was, he flatly declared that he would not go; that to go trotting from Kuntsovo to Moscow and from Moscow to Tsaritsino, and then from Tsaritsino again to Moscow, from Moscow again to Kuntsovo, was a piece of folly; and, ‘in fact,’ he added, ‘let them first prove to my satisfaction, that one can be merrier on one spot of the globe than another spot, and I will go.’This, of course, no one could prove to his satisfaction, and Anna Vassilyevna was ready to throw up the partie du plaisir for lack of a solid escort; but she recollected Uvar Ivanovitch, and in her distress she sent to his room for him, saying: ‘a drowning man catches at straws.’They waked him up; he came down, listened in silence to Anna Vassilyevna’s proposition, and, to the general astonishment, with a flourish of his fingers, he consented to go.Anna Vassilyevna kissed him on the cheek, and called him a darling; Nikolai Artemyevitch smiled contemptuously and said: quelle bourde!(he liked on occasions to make use of a ‘smart’ French word); and the following morning the coach and the open carriage, well-packed, rolled out of the Stahovs’ court-yard.In the coach were the ladies, a maid, and Bersenyev; Insarov was seated on the box; and in the open carriage were Uvar Ivanovitch and Shubin.Uvar Ivanovitch had himself beckoned Shubin to him; he knew that he would tease him the whole way, but there existed a queer sort of attachment, marked by abusive candour, between the ‘primeval force’ and the young artist.On this occasion, however, Shubin left his fat friend in peace; he was absent-minded, silent, and gentle."
"当马车赶到察里津诺古堡的废墟前时，太阳已经高高地挂在万里无云的蓝天中了，即使是在中午，那个古堡看起来还是一样地阴森可怕。所有人都下车走到草地上，接着就立刻朝公园方向走去。埃琳娜、卓娅和因萨罗夫走在了前面，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜则挽着尤瓦·伊万诺维奇的手臂，一脸幸福地跟在他们的后面。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇喘着粗气步履蹒跚地走着，脑袋被一顶新草帽磨痛，双脚在靴子里感到一阵阵的刺痛，但他却十分开心。舒宾和别尔谢涅夫走在了后面。“小伙子，我们就像退伍军人一样，很快就会成为预备军了，”舒宾低声对别尔谢涅夫说道，“那里现在是保加利亚的了！”他继续说着，并朝埃琳娜方向挑了挑眉。","The sun stood high in a cloudless blue sky when the carriage drove up to the ruins of Tsaritsino Castle, which looked gloomy and menacing, even at mid-day.The whole party stepped out on to the grass, and at once made a move towards the garden.In front went Elena and Zoya with Insarov; Anna Vassilyevna, with an expression of perfect happiness on her face, walked behind them, leaning on the arm of Uvar Ivanovitch.He waddled along panting, his new straw hat cut his forehead, and his feet twinged in his boots, but he was content; Shubin and Bersenyev brought up the rear.‘We will form the reserve, my dear boy, like veterans,’ whispered Shubin to Bersenyev.‘Bulgaria’s in it now!’ he added, indicating Elena with his eyebrows."
"天气真是太好了。周围鲜花怒放，蜂飞蝶舞，百鸟争鸣，远处的湖水波光粼粼，所有的人的心情都十分轻松欢快。“哦，实在是太美了，哦，太美了！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜不停地惊呼着，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇也不住地点头赞同她的观点，甚至有一次还开口说道：“确实是这样！确实是这样！”埃琳娜时不时地跟因萨罗夫聊上几句，卓娅则用两根纤细的手指轻轻地扶着头上那顶大草帽的帽檐，从粉红色的巴雷格纱裙下的浅灰色圆头鞋子里偷偷伸出长着圆圆脚趾的小脚，她不断地张望着，一会儿朝旁边看看，一会儿朝后面看看。“唉！”舒宾突然低声喊道，“卓娅·尼基季什娜好像在四处寻人呢。我要去她那边。现在埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜看不起我，但对于你，安德烈·彼得罗维奇，她还是很敬重你的，不过说到底还是一样的。我要过去了，我不想再让自己这么烦。我建议你啊，我亲爱的朋友，应该多去研究研究植物，就你目前的状况而言，这是最好的选择，而且从科学的观点来说，这对你的学习也是很有帮助的。再会！”舒宾跑到卓娅那里，伸出手臂说：“小姐，请伸出手来。”然后，他就牵着她的手朝前方走去。埃琳娜停了下来，把别尔谢涅夫喊到了自己的身旁，挽起了他的手臂，但仍然在和因萨罗夫聊天。她问他铃兰花、苜蓿、橡树和椴树等等用保加利亚语怎么说……“彻底被保加利亚占领了！”可怜的安德烈·彼得罗维奇暗自想着。","The weather was glorious.Everything around was flowering, humming, singing; in the distance shone the waters of the lakes; a light-hearted holiday mood took possession of all.‘Oh, how beautiful; oh, how beautiful!’Anna Vassilyevna repeated incessantly; Uvar Ivanovitch kept nodding his head approvingly in response to her enthusiastic exclamations, and once even articulated: ‘To be sure!to be sure!’From time to time Elena exchanged a few words with Insarov; Zoya held the brim of her large hat with two fingers while her little feet, shod in light grey shoes with rounded toes, peeped coquettishly out from under her pink barege dress; she kept looking to each side and then behind her.‘Hey!’ cried Shubin suddenly in a low voice, ‘Zoya Nikitishna is on the lookout, it seems.I will go to her.Elena Nikolaevna despises me now, while you, Andrei Petrovitch, she esteems, which comes to the same thing.I am going; I’m tired of being glum.I should advise you, my dear fellow, to do some botanising; that’s the best thing you could hit on in your position; it might be useful, too, from a scientific point of view.Farewell!’Shubin ran up to Zoya, offered her his arm, and saying: ‘Ihre Hand, Madame’ caught hold of her hand, and pushed on ahead with her.Elena stopped, called to Bersenyev, and also took his arm, but continued talking to Insarov.She asked him the words for lily-of-the-valley, clover, oak, lime, and so on in his language…‘Bulgaria’s in it!’ thought poor Andrei Petrovitch."
"突然前面传来了一阵尖叫声，大家都朝那边看去。舒宾的香烟盒子被卓娅扔到灌木丛中了。“等一下，我一定会找你算账的！”他一边喊着，一边钻进了灌木丛里，找到香烟盒后，他正要回到了卓娅那里，但还没走到她的身边，那盒子又被扔到了路的对面。这个动作又被重复了四遍，他就这样一直笑嘻嘻地威胁她，但卓娅只是俏皮地笑了笑，然后就像小猫似的蜷缩在一起。后来他抓住了她的手指，用力地捏了一下，然后她就立刻尖叫了起来，过后还假装生气，不停地吹着那被捏的手指，而舒宾则在她耳边低声说着什么。","Suddenly a shriek was heard in front; every one looked up.Shubin’s cigar-case fell into a bush, flung by Zoya’s hand.‘Wait a minute, I’ll pay you out!’ he shouted, as he crept into the bushes; he found his cigar-case, and was returning to Zoya; but he had hardly reached her side when again his cigar-case was sent flying across the road.Five times this trick was repeated, he kept laughing and threatening her, but Zoya only smiled slyly and drew herself together, like a little cat.At last he snatched her fingers, and squeezed them so tightly that she shrieked, and for a long time afterwards breathed on her hand, pretending to be angry, while he murmured something in her ears."
"“这些年轻人真是淘气。”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜心情愉悦地对尤瓦·伊万诺维奇说道。","‘Mischievous things, young people,’ Anna Vassilyevna observed gaily to Uvar Ivanovitch."
"他听后，只是动了动手指。","He flourished his fingers in reply."
"“卓娅·尼基季什娜真是个小女孩！”别尔谢涅夫对埃琳娜说。","‘What a girl Zoya Nikitishna is!’ said Bersenyev to Elena."
"“那舒宾呢？他又如何呢？”她回答说。","‘And Shubin?What of him?’ she answered."
"此时，大家都已经来到了凉亭里，这里是欣赏景物的最佳地点，所以大家都纷纷停下脚步观赏察里津诺湖那迷人的风光。这些湖泊连绵数十英里，周围被一大片浓密的树林包围。一大片青翠色的草地覆盖在最那片大湖泊前面的斜坡上，在水中显现出一种绿翡翠般的色彩。湖水一片沉寂，甚至连湖边也没有一丝浪花。远远看去，就好像是一块坚硬无比的大玻璃笨重地、闪闪发亮地横躺在一个硕大的洗礼盘中，天空也仿佛沉到了它的底部，郁郁葱葱的树林也在静静地注视着自己在水里的倒影。所有人都沉浸在这安静迷人的景色当中，就连舒宾也变得一言不发，卓娅也完全被吸引住了。后来，所有人都准备去水面上游玩。舒宾、因萨罗夫和别尔谢涅夫纷纷从草地上跑了下来。他们找到了一条刷过漆的大船，然后又雇了两个船夫，这才把那群小姐夫人喊了过来。女士们纷纷坐进了船里，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇则小心翼翼地跟在她们后面钻了进去。当他在船上坐好后，所有人都哈哈大笑起来。“小心点儿，我的大老爷，千万不要把船给弄翻了。”其中一个船夫说道，他穿着一件鲜艳的印花衬衫，鼻子短翘。“得了吧，你话真多！”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇回答说。船终于出发了。几个年轻人都拿起了木浆，但只有因萨罗夫才懂得如何划船。舒宾建议大家合唱一首俄罗斯民谣，并起头唱道：“奔腾的伏尔加河……”然后，别尔谢涅夫、卓娅甚至是安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜也一起唱了起来——因萨罗夫不知道该怎么唱——但是其他人也唱得不怎么整齐，到第三部分的时候，大家就完全唱错了。只有别尔谢涅夫还在用低音继续唱着，“波涛中什么东西也看不到。”然而他也很快就坚持不下去了。那两个船夫相互看了看对方，咧着嘴悄悄笑了起来。","Meanwhile the whole party went into the arbour, well known as Pleasant View arbour, and stopped to admire the view of the Tsaritsino lakes.They stretched one behind the other for several miles, overshadowed by thick woods.The bright green grass, which covered the hill sloping down to the largest lake, gave the water itself an extraordinarily vivid emerald colour.Even at the water’s edge not a ripple stirred the smooth surface.One might fancy it a solid mass of glass lying heavy and shining in a huge font; the sky seemed to drop into its depths, while the leafy trees gazed motionless into its transparent bosom.All were absorbed in long and silent admiration of the view; even Shubin was still; even Zoya was impressed.At last, all with one mind, began to wish to go upon the water.Shubin, Insarov, and Bersenyev raced each other over the grass.They succeeded in finding a large painted boat and two boatmen, and beckoned to the ladies.The ladies stepped into the boat; Uvar Ivanovitch cautiously lowered himself into it after them.Great was the mirth while he got in and took his seat.‘Look out, master, don’t drown us,’ observed one of the boatmen, a snubnosed young fellow in a gay print shirt.‘Get along, you swell!’ said Uvar Ivanovitch.The boat pushed off.The young men took up the oars, but Insarov was the only one of them who could row.Shubin suggested that they should sing some Russian song in chorus, and struck up: ‘Down the river Volga’… Bersenyev, Zoya, and even Anna Vassilyevna, joined in—Insarov could not sing—but they did not keep together; at the third verse the singers were all wrong.Only Bersenyev tried to go on in the bass, ‘Nothing on the waves is seen,’ but he, too, was soon in difficulties.The boatmen looked at one another and grinned in silence."
"“嗯？”舒宾转向他们问道，“你们觉得我们不会唱歌吗？”那个穿着印花衬衣的年轻人只是摇了摇头。“等着看吧，翘鼻子，”舒宾反驳说，“我们给你来一曲。卓娅·尼基季什娜，请给我们唱首尼德迈耶尔的名曲《湖泊》吧。不要再划啦！”几只湿漉漉的木浆停了下来，像翅膀一样指向了天空，桨上的水滴有节奏地往下落着，船又向前划了一段，然后就停在了那里，像一只天鹅似的在水里轻轻摇摆着。刚开始，卓娅还假装推辞……“唱啊。”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜温柔地说……然后，卓娅就拿掉了草帽，放声唱了起来：“哦，湖泊，一年才刚刚过去！”","‘Eh?’ said Shubin, turning to them, ‘the gentlefolks can’t sing, you say?’The boy in the print shirt only shook his head.‘Wait a little snubnose,’ retorted Shubin, ‘we will show you.Zoya Nikitishna, sing us Le lac of Niedermeyer.Stop rowing!’The wet oars stood still, lifted in the air like wings, and their splash died away with a tuneful drip; the boat drifted on a little, then stood still, rocking lightly on the water like a swan.Zoya affected to refuse at first….‘Allons’ said Anna Vassilyevna genially….Zoya took off her hat and began to sing: ‘O lac, l’annee a peine a fini sa carriere!’"
"她那轻微但纯洁的声音漂浮在湖面上，每一个词语都回荡在远处的树林中，仿佛在那里也有一个人在歌唱，声音听起来既神秘又超凡脱俗。当卓娅唱完的时候，一阵喝彩声从岸边的一个凉亭里传了出来，那里有几个来察里津诺游玩的红脸德国佬。他们中有好几个人都没有穿大衣，也没有系领带，甚至连背心也没有穿，他们一直在狂喊着“再来一曲”，无奈之下，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜只好让船夫尽快将船靠到湖的另一边。然而，在船还没有靠岸的时候，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇再次把大家给震住了，他注意到在树林的某一个地方，有一个回声特别地清晰，然后他就突然学着鹌鹑叫了起来。起先大家都吓了一跳，但是很快便开心地听了起来，尤其是在尤瓦·伊万诺维奇模仿的叫声栩栩如生的时候。受到鼓舞之后，他又试图模仿猫叫，但这次却没有成功，接着又模仿了一次鹌鹑的叫声后，他瞅了瞅大家，然后停了下来。舒宾挤过去要亲他一下，但却被他推开了。就在这个时候，船靠到了岸边，所有人都走下船来，朝岸上走去。","Her small, but pure voice, seemed to dart over the surface of the lake; every word echoed far off in the woods; it sounded as though some one were singing there, too, in a distinct, but mysterious and unearthly voice.When Zoya finished, a loud bravo was heard from an arbour near the bank, from which emerged several red-faced Germans who were picnicking at Tsaritsino.Several of them had their coats off, their ties, and even their waistcoats; and they shouted ‘bis!’ with such unmannerly insistence that Anna Vassilyevna told the boatmen to row as quickly as possible to the other end of the lake.But before the boat reached the bank, Uvar Ivanovitch once more succeeded in surprising his friends; having noticed that in one part of the wood the echo repeated every sound with peculiar distinctness, he suddenly began to call like a quail.At first every one was startled, but they listened directly with real pleasure, especially as Uvar Ivanovitch imitated the quail’s cry with great correctness.Spurred on by this, he tried mewing like a cat; but this did not go off so well; and after one more quail-call, he looked at them all and stopped.Shubin threw himself on him to kiss him; he pushed him off.At that instant the boat touched the bank, and all the party got out and went on shore."
"这时，车夫、一个男仆和一个女仆从马车里端出了篮子，在老菩提树下的草地上摆好了午餐。他们围着一块桌布坐了下来，津津有味地品尝着各种各样的馅饼和其他的食品。他们的胃口都很好，但安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜还是不住地劝宾客们多吃点儿，并对他们说没有什么东西能比在美景中野餐更有营养了。她甚至将这些话讲给了尤瓦·伊万诺维奇听。“不用担心我！”他张着那塞满食物的嘴巴含糊不清地说道，“如此美好的天气，简直就是上帝送给我们的礼物！”她不停地重复着。人们好像从没见过她似的，她看起来仿佛小了二十岁。别尔谢涅夫把这些告诉了她。“是的，是的，”她说道，“年轻的时候，我的相貌可是数一数二的。”舒宾紧挨着卓娅坐着，不停地给她添酒，虽然卓娅拒绝，但舒宾却执拗地让她把酒喝掉，结果，他每喝完一杯，就逼着卓娅也干一杯，他甚至说他很想把头靠在她的膝盖上，但是，不管怎样她都决不会让他“如此随便”的。埃琳娜恐怕是这一群中最严肃的一个，但是她的内心却十分地平静，这种感觉她很长时间都没有体会过了。她觉得自己充满了善意和仁慈，因此，她常常想着要把因萨罗夫和别尔谢涅夫都留在自己的身边……安德烈·彼得罗维奇朦胧地感觉到了这些，所以暗自叹了口气。","Meanwhile the coachman, with the groom and the maid, had brought the baskets out of the coach, and made dinner ready on the grass under the old lime-trees.They sat down round the outspread tablecloth, and fell upon the pies and other dainties.They all had excellent appetites, while Anna Vassilyevna, with unflagging hospitality, kept urging the guests to eat more, assuring them that nothing was more wholesome than eating in the open air.She even encouraged Uvar Ivanovitch with such assurances.‘Don’t trouble about me!’ he grunted with his mouth full.‘Such a lovely day is a God-send, indeed!’she repeated constantly.One would not have known her; she seemed fully twenty years younger.Bersenyev said as much to her.‘Yes, yes.’she said; ‘I could hold my own with any one in my day.’Shubin attached himself to Zoya, and kept pouring her out wine; she refused it, he pressed her, and finished by drinking the glass himself, and again pressing her to take another; he also declared that he longed to lay his head on her knee; she would on no account permit him ‘such a liberty.’Elena seemed the most serious of the party, but in her heart there was a wonderful sense of peace, such as she had not known for long.She felt filled with boundless goodwill and kindness, and wanted to keep not only Insarov, but Bersenyev too, always at her side….Andrei Petrovitch dimly understood what this meant, and secretly he sighed."
"几个小时很快就过去了，此时，夜幕已经降临。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜突然变得急躁起来。“啊，我亲爱的朋友们，怎么这么晚了！”她喊道，“再美好的事情也有结束的时候，现在我们该回家了。”她开始慌乱起来，此时大家也都急急忙忙地站起身来朝古堡那边的马车走去。当路过那片湖泊时，他们再次停下了脚步，最后一次欣赏着察里津诺那迷人的风景。周围的一切都笼罩在那傍晚鲜艳的色调中，整个天空一片火红，树上的叶子被渐起的风吹起时，反射出各种各样的颜色，远处的湖面上金光流动，那些坐落在公园里的红色塔楼和凉亭，在青绿色树林的环绕下，既鲜明又清晰。“再见了，察里津诺，我们不会忘记这一天的！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜喃喃说道……但是，就在这个时候，好像要验证她所说的话似的，突然发生了一件奇怪的事情，这件事的确是不会让人忘记的。","The hours flew by; the evening was coming on.Anna Vassilyevna suddenly took alarm.‘Ah, my dear friends, how late it is!’ she cried.‘All good things must have an end; it’s time to go home.’She began bustling about, and they all hastened to get up and walk towards the castle, where the carriages were.As they walked past the lakes, they stopped to admire Tsaritsino for the last time.The landscape on all sides was glowing with the vivid hues of early evening; the sky was red, the leaves were flashing with changing colours as they stirred in the rising wind; the distant waters shone in liquid gold; the reddish turrets and arbours scattered about the garden stood out sharply against the dark green of the trees.‘Farewell, Tsaritsino, we shall not forget to-day’s excursion!’ observed Anna Vassilyevna….But at that instant, and as though in confirmation of her words, a strange incident occurred, which certainly was not likely to be forgotten."
"事情是这样的。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜还没有跟察里津诺告别完，一阵欢呼声和吵闹声就突然地从她身旁几步远的丁香丛中传了出来，接着，一伙穿戴不齐的年轻人，也就是刚才朝卓娅欢呼的那群德国人，突然跳到了路中间。这群喜欢音乐的年轻人看起来像是喝醉了。他们一看到女士就停下了脚步，但是，他们中间一个个头很高的小伙子从人群中走了出来，那人长着公牛一般的粗脖子和大眼睛，他笨拙地拿掉帽子，摇摇晃晃地来到已经吓呆了的安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜身边。","This was what happened.Anna Vassilyevna had hardly sent her farewell greeting to Tsaritsino, when suddenly, a few paces from her, behind a high bush of lilac, were heard confused exclamations, shouts, and laughter; and a whole mob of disorderly men, the same devotees of song who had so energetically applauded Zoya, burst out on the path.These musical gentlemen seemed excessively elevated.They stopped at the sight of the ladies; but one of them, a man of immense height, with a bull neck and a bull’s goggle eyes, separated from his companions, and, bowing clumsily and staggering unsteadily in his gait, approached Anna Vassilyevna, who was petrified with alarm."
"“您好，夫人，”他用憨厚的声音说道，“你还好吗？”","‘Bonzhoor, madame,’ he said thickly, ‘how are you?’"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜后退了几步。","Anna Vassilyevna started back."
"“你怎么了，”那个高个子用不太娴熟的俄语问道，“我们当时高呼着请你们再唱一首，你为何要拒绝呢？”","‘Why wouldn’t you,’ continued the giant in vile Russian, ’sing again when our party shouted bis, and bravo?’"
"“没错，为什么啊？”他的同伴也一起叫嚷着。","‘Yes, why?’ came from the ranks of his comrades."
"因萨罗夫准备走上前去，但舒宾却拦住了他，他自己挡在了安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的前面。","Insarov was about to step forward, but Shubin stopped him, and himself screened Anna Vassilyevna."
"“让我来，”他说，“尊贵的朋友们，你们的行为让我们感到十分诧异。我可以看出，你们应该是高加索民族撒克逊人的后代，那么，我们就有理由相信，你们肯定会熟知一些交往的礼仪和规范，然而这位朋友，你还没有介绍自己，就这样贸然地跟这位夫人搭起讪来。你要知道，假如是在其他场合，我会很乐意来交你这个朋友，因为我看到你身体十分强壮，二头肌、三头肌和三角肌都很发达，作为一个雕塑家，我会很乐意邀请你去给我当模特的，但是现在，你就不要再打扰我们了。”","‘Allow me,’ he began, ‘honoured stranger, to express to you the heartfelt amazement, into which you have thrown all of us by your conduct.You belong, as far as I can judge, to the Saxon branch of the Caucasian race; consequently we are bound to assume your acquaintance with the customs of society, yet you address a lady to whom you have not been introduced.I assure you that I individually should be delighted another time to make your acquaintance, since I observe in you a phenomenal development of the muscles, biceps, triceps and deltoid, so that, as a sculptor, I should esteem it a genuine happiness to have you for a model; but on this occasion kindly leave us alone.’"
"那位“尊贵的朋友”听了之后，满不在乎地将头偏在一边，两手叉腰站在那里。","The ‘honoured stranger’ listened to Shubin’s speech, his head held contemptuously on one side and his arms akimbo."
"“我不明白你在说什么，”他最后开口说道，“你不会认为我是个补鞋匠或是个修表工吧？喂！我可是个官员，一个当官的。知道吗！”","‘I don’t understand what you say,’ he commented at last.‘Do you suppose I’m a cobbler or a watchmaker?Hey!I’m an officer, an official, so there.’"
"“这点我不否认——”舒宾说着。","‘I don’t doubt that—’ Shubin was beginning."
"“我所说的是这样，”那个官员继续说着，并用那结实的双手将他推到旁边，就好像在踢开路上的树枝一样——“当我们叫好的时候，你为什么不再唱一首呢？我会马上离开，只要这位小姐，不是那位夫人，不，不是她，而是这位小姐或者是那位（他指了指埃琳娜和卓娅），能够亲吻一下我的脸颊，没错，用德语讲就是亲我一下，怎么样？这可一点儿都不过分啊。”","‘What I say is,’ continued the stranger, putting him aside with his powerful arm, like a twig out of the path—‘why didn’t you sing again when we shouted bis?And I’ll go away directly, this minute, only I tell you what I want, this fraulein, not that madam, no, not her, but this one or that one (he pointed to Elena and Zoya) must give me einen Kuss, as we say in German, a kiss, in fact; eh?That’s not much to ask.’"
"“亲一下没什么大不了的。”他的同伴再次叫嚷了起来，“嘿！这下有意思了！”一个略带醉意的德国人说着，笑得前仰后合。","‘Einen Kuss, that’s not much,’ came again from the ranks of his companions, ‘Ih!der Stakramenter!’ cried one tipsy German, bursting with laughter."
"卓娅抓住了因萨罗夫的手臂，但他却挣脱开来，直冲到那个无礼的高个子身边。","Zoya clutched at Insarov’s arm, but he broke away from her, and stood directly facing the insolent giant."
"“识相的话快滚开。”他低声说道，但听起来却很严厉。","‘You will please to move off,’ he said in a voice not loud but sharp."
"那个德国人大笑了起来，“滚开？不过我就喜欢这样。难道我不会走路吗？滚开？为什么我要滚开？”","The German gave a heavy laugh, ‘Move off ?Well, I like that.Can’t I walk where I please?Move off?Why should I move off?’"
"“因为你冒犯了这位夫人，”因萨罗夫说着，脸色突然变得苍白起来，“因为你喝醉了。”","‘Because you have dared to annoy a lady,’ said Insarov, and suddenly he turned white, ‘because you’re drunk.’"
"“嗯？我喝醉了？听听他说的话。你懂了吗，医生？我可是个当官的，而他竟然……现在我要得到满足。她必须得亲我一下。”","‘Eh?me drunk?Hear what he says.Horen Sie das, Herr Provisor?I’m an officer, and he dares…Now I demand satisfaction.Einen Kuss will ich.’"
"“如果你胆敢向前一步——”因萨罗夫说道。","‘If you come another step nearer—’ began Insarov."
"“哦？那又怎样？”","‘Well?What then’"
"“我就将你扔到水里去！”","‘I’ll throw you in the water!’"
"“扔到水里？先生们！就这样吗？好吧，那就让大伙儿瞧瞧，那肯定很好玩。”","‘In the water?Herr Je!Is that all?Well, let us see that, that would be very curious, too.’"
"那个官员握起拳头，向前挪了一步，但猛然间，一件令人惊奇的事情发生了。他尖叫了一声，随后整个笨重的身体就被抬了起来，双腿在空中胡乱地踢着，接着，在女士们还没来得及尖叫出来、大家还不知道怎么回事的时候，随着一声巨响，那官员肥胖的身体就被扔了出去，并很快地消失在了漩涡中。","The officer lifted his fists and moved forward, but suddenly something extraordinary happened.He uttered an exclamation, his whole bulky person staggered, rose from the ground, his legs kicking in the air, and before the ladies had time to shriek, before any one had time to realise how it had happened, the officer’s massive figure went plop with a heavy splash, and at once disappeared under the eddying water."
"“哦！”女士们异口同声地尖叫了起来。“老天啊！”另一边的人也在喊着。没过多久……一个圆圆的、满头是水的脑袋从水里钻了出来，口里在不停地吐着水泡，两手在嘴边胡乱地挣扎着。“他会被淹死的，快去救救他！救救他！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜朝因萨罗夫喊道，他此时正站在岸边，双脚分开，喘着粗气。","‘Oh!’ screamed the ladies with one voice.‘Mein Gott!’ was heard from the other side.An instant passed… and a round head, all plastered over with wet hair, showed above water, it was blowing bubbles, this head; and floundering with two hands just at its very lips.‘He will be drowned, save him!save him!’ cried Anna Vassilyevna to Insarov, who was standing with his legs apart on the bank, breathing heavily."
"“他会游上来的，”因萨罗夫回答说，夹杂着不屑和冷淡的语气，“我们出发吧，”他挽起安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的手臂说道，“走吧，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜。”","‘He will swim out,’ he answered with contemptuous and unsympathetic indifference.‘Let us go on,’ he added, taking Anna Vassilyevna by the arm.‘Come, Uvar Ivanovitch, Elena Nikolaevna.’"
"“啊——啊——哦——哦！”那个不幸的德国人此刻正痛苦地呻吟着，他刚抓住了岸边的灯芯草。","‘A—a—o—o’ was heard at that instant, the plaint of the hapless German who had managed to get hold of the rushes on the bank."
"大家都尾随在因萨罗夫的后面，从那群人的身边经过。不过，没了领头人，这群横行霸道的德国人立马变得谦逊起来，大气都不敢吭一声，但其中一个比较胆大的德国人摇着头喃喃自语着：“好吧……这个简直太……你们就等着瞧吧。”而另一个人却恭敬地甚至摘掉了帽子。对他们而言，因萨罗夫是难以对付的，他的脸上刻着一种仇恨、危险的神态。那群德国人急冲冲地去拉自己的同伴，刚一上岸，那个家伙就泪流满面地朝这些“俄国无赖们”辱骂了起来，口口声声地说着要去起诉他们，还要去见冯基泽里茨伯爵等等。","They all followed Insarov, and had to pass close by the party.But, deprived of their leader, the rowdies were subdued and did not utter a word; but one, the boldest of them, muttered, shaking his head menacingly: ‘All right… we shall see though… after that’; but one of the others even took his hat off.Insarov struck them as formidable, and rightly so; something evil, something dangerous could be seen in his face.The Germans hastened to pull out their comrade, who, directly he had his feet on dry ground, broke into tearful abuse and shouted after the ‘Russian scoundrels,’ that he would make a complaint, that he would go to Count Von Kizerits himself, and so on."
"但这些“俄国无赖们”并没有把他的话放在心上，只是尽可能地加快脚步朝古堡走去。穿过公园的时候，大家谁都没有说话，只有安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜轻轻地叹了口气。然而，当他们走到马车旁停下来的时候，大家都抑制不住地开怀大笑起来。舒宾带头狂笑出声，简直就跟疯了一样，别尔谢涅夫也跟着他咯咯地笑了起来，而卓娅也发出了银铃般的笑声，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜也猛地笑出声来，就连埃琳娜也忍住不地微笑着，最后，因萨罗夫也终于撑不住笑了。然而，谁都没有尤瓦·伊万诺维奇笑得更大声、更持久、更猛烈，他一直笑到肚子发疼，呼吸急促，喷嚏连连。他安静了好一会儿后，在笑出的泪花里低声说着：“我——一直在想——怎么会有一声巨响——那里——原来是他——被扔到水里了。”好不容易将最后一句话说完，他又开始狂笑了起来，整个身体随着笑声不断地颤抖着。卓娅趁机推波助澜。“我看到了他的双腿，”她说，“在空中胡乱地踢着。”“是的，是的，”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇随声附和着，“他的双腿，他的双腿——然后就是砰的一声！他整个人都被扔到水里了！”","But the ‘Russian scoundrels’ paid no attention to his vociferations, and hurried on as fast as they could to the castle.They were all silent, as they walked through the garden, though Anna Vassilyevna sighed a little.But when they reached the carriages and stood still, they broke into an irrepressible, irresistible fit of Homeric laughter.First Shubin exploded, shrieking as if he were mad, Bersenyev followed with his gurgling guffaw, then Zoya fell into thin tinkling little trills, Anna Vassilyevna too suddenly broke down, Elena could not help smiling, and even Insarov at last could not resist it.But the loudest, longest, most persistent laugh was Uvar Ivanovitch’s; he laughed till his sides ached, till he choked and panted.He would calm down a little, then would murmur through his tears: ‘I—thought—what’s that splash—and there—he—went plop.’And with the last word, forced out with convulsive effort, his whole frame was shaking with another burst of laughter.Zoya made him worse.‘I saw his legs,’ she said, ‘kicking in the air.’‘Yes, yes,’ gasped Uvar Ivanovitch, ‘his legs, his legs—and then splash!—there he plopped in!’"
"“因萨罗夫到底是怎么办到的？那个德国人看起来不是比他壮实很多吗？”卓娅问道。","‘And how did Mr. Insarov manage it?why the German was three times his size?’ said Zoya."
"“让我来告诉你吧，”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇一边说着，一边不停地抹着眼泪，“我当时看到了，他的一只胳膊环绕在他的腰间，并用脚狠狠地绊了他一下，然后他就掉进水里了！我听到——扑通一声巨响——他就被扔了出去。”","‘I’ll tell you,’ answered Uvar Ivanovitch, rubbing his eyes, ‘I saw; with one arm about his waist, he tripped him up, and he went plop!I heard—a splash—there he went.’"
"两辆马车渐渐地远去，此时已经赶了很长时间的路了，察里津诺古堡也逐渐地消失在了眼帘里，而尤瓦·伊万诺维奇却依旧控制不住自己的情绪。后来，跟他坐在一起的舒宾忍不住地嘲笑起他来。","Long after the carriages had started, long after the castle of Tsaritsino was out of sight, Uvar Ivanovitch was still unable to regain his composure.Shubin, who was again with him in the carriage, began to cry shame on him at last."
"然而，因萨罗夫却觉得很不好意思。他正对着埃琳娜坐在马车里（别尔谢涅夫坐在赶车的位置上），一句话都不说，而她也是沉默不语。他猜想，她肯定是在心里责备自己刚才的鲁莽，但是她却没有责备他。她从一开始比较害怕，后来他脸上的神情让她感到十分惊奇，接着她就一直在思索着。她本人也不清楚自己到底在思索着什么。白天她所经历的情感现在都已消失殆尽，她也意识到了这点，此刻，这种情感已被另一种她也说不清楚的感觉代替了。这次游玩结束得太晚，转眼间夜幕已降临。两辆马车在路上疾驶着，有时路过成熟的庄稼田地，那里的空气里充满了小麦的芬芳，有时会路过宽阔的草地，一阵阵新鲜的空气就会迎面扑来。此时，整个天空就好像一层烟雾笼罩在地平线上。最后，月亮升了起来，暗淡而又鲜红。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜此刻已经闭上了眼睛，而卓娅则把脑袋探出窗外，呆呆地望着外面的大路。埃琳娜终于意识到，她已经有一个多小时没有跟因萨罗夫说过话了。于是她请教了他一个无关痛痒的问题，他立刻高兴地回答了她。空气中传来了一阵模糊不清的声音，就好像是远处的各种声响被夹杂在了一起，他们已经离莫斯科很近了。远处的灯光若隐若现，渐渐地，那些光线便强了起来，终于，他们来到了铺有鹅卵石的路面上了。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜醒了过来，大家在马车里也都开始说起话来，尽管都听不清楚对方在讲着什么，所有的声音都被车轮声和马蹄声给淹没了。从莫斯科到孔佐沃的路程仿佛变得既遥远又疲惫，大家要么已经睡着，要么就是沉默不语，都把脑袋靠在各自的角落里，埃琳娜睁着眼睛，她一直在凝视着因萨罗夫那朦胧的身影。一股悲伤的情绪萦绕在舒宾的心中，微风吹过他的眼睛，也会刺激到他，他拢了拢大衣领子，眼眶里充满了泪水。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇平静地打着鼾睡着了，身体在不停地晃悠着。马车终于停了下来。两个仆人把安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜搀了下来，此刻她已经精疲力尽了，和大家分别时，她声称自己快“累死了”，大家都纷纷向她表示感谢，但她却一直在重复着“累死了”。埃琳娜在分别时第一次握了下因萨罗夫的手掌，接着就在窗前坐了很长时间，舒宾趁机对别尔谢涅夫低声说道：","Insarov felt ashamed.He sat in the coach facing Elena (Bersenyev had taken his seat on the box), and he said nothing; she too was silent.He thought that she was condemning his action; but she did not condemn him.She had been scared at the first minute; then the expression of his face had impressed her; afterwards she pondered on it all.It was not quite clear to her what the nature of her reflections was.The emotion she had felt during the day had passed away; that she realised; but its place had been taken by another feeling which she did not yet fully understand.The partie de plaisir had been prolonged too late; insensibly evening passed into night.The carriage rolled swiftly along, now beside ripening cornfields, where the air was heavy and fragrant with the smell of wheat; now beside wide meadows, from which a sudden wave of freshness blew lightly in the face.The sky seemed to lie like smoke over the horizon.At last the moon rose, dark and red.Anna Vassilyevna was dozing; Zoya had poked her head out of window and was staring at the road.It occurred to Elena at last that she had not spoken to Insarov for more than an hour.She turned to him with a trifling question; he at once answered her, delighted.Dim sounds began stirring indistinctly in the air, as though thousands of voices were talking in the distance; Moscow was coming to meet them.Lights twinkled afar off; they grew more and more frequent; at last there was the grating of the cobbles under their wheels.Anna Vassilyevna awoke, every one in the carriage began talking, though no one could hear what was said; everything was drowned in the rattle of the cobbles under the two carriages, and the hoofs of the eight horses.Long and wearisome seemed the journey from Moscow to Kuntsovo; all the party were asleep or silent, leaning with their heads pressed into their respective corners; Elena did not close her eyes; she kept them fixed on Insarov’s dimly-outlined figure.A mood of sadness had come upon Shubin; the breeze was blowing into his eyes and irritating him; he retired into the collar of his cloak and was on the point of tears.Uvar Ivanovitch was snoring blissfully, rocking from side to side.The carriages came to a standstill at last.Two men-servants lifted Anna Vassilyevna out of the carriage; she was all to pieces, and at parting from her fellow travellers, announced that she was ‘nearly dead’; they began thanking her, but she only repeated, ‘nearly dead.’ Elena for the first time pressed Insarov’s hand at parting, and for a long while she sat at her window before undressing; Shubin seized an opportunity to whisper to Bersenyev:"
"“瞧，他可真是个大英雄，他竟然可以把喝醉了的德国人扔进水里去！”","‘There, isn’t he a hero; he can pitch drunken Germans into the river!’"
"“然而你却办不到。”别尔谢涅夫反驳道，然后就和因萨罗夫一起回去了。","‘While you didn’t even do that,’ retorted Bersenyev, and he started homewards with Insarov."
"当这两个年轻人回到别墅的时候，天空已经露出了白肚皮。此刻，太阳还没有出来，但是空气中已经传来了阵阵凉意，灰白色的露水出现在了草地上，早起的一群云雀在朦胧辽阔的天空中大声叫着，那里还有最后一颗星星挂在空中，像一只独眼似的俯瞰着整个大地。","The dawn was already showing in the sky when the two friends reached their lodging.The sun had not yet risen, but already the chill of daybreak was in the air, a grey dew covered the grass, and the first larks were trilling high, high up in the shadowy infinity of air, whence like a solitary eye looked out the great, last star."
"第十六章","CHAPTER XVI"
"和因萨罗夫熟识之后，埃琳娜（第五次或者是第六次）开始写日记了。下面的内容节选自她的日记：","Soon after her acquaintance with Insarov, Elena (for the fifth or sixth time) began a diary.Here are some extracts from it:"
"“六月……安德烈·彼得罗维奇拿了几本书给我，但我却读不下去。我不好意思跟他讲实话，但我又不想在还书的时候骗他说我已看过了。我觉得那样会伤害到他。他一直都很关心我。看起来他可能有点儿喜欢我吧。他真是个好人，安德烈·彼得罗维奇……我在想些什么啊？为什么我心里会感到这样地沉重，这样地压抑？为什么我看到飞过的小鸟时会感到嫉妒？我感觉到，我很希望跟它们一起翱翔在空中，去哪里我不知道，但一定要远离这个地方。我这种想法难道不邪恶吗？我的父母，我的家庭全在这边。难道我不爱他们了吗？是的，我现在已经不像我所希望的那样爱他们了。要承认这一点真得很可怕，但这却是事实。或许我天生就是个充满罪恶感的人，或许这就是我内心伤感和不安的原因吧。好像有一只无形的手抓住了我，把我摁倒，我好像被关在了一个监狱里，四周的墙壁马上就要朝我这边倒来。为什么别人没有这种感觉呢？如果我对自己的双亲都冷漠不语，那我还会爱谁呢？很明显，父亲是对的，他老是责备我说除了小猫小狗，我就不会爱别人了。这点我要好好想想。我很少祈祷的，但我现在应该去祷告一下……啊，我觉得我是知道怎样去爱的！当和因萨罗夫先生在一起的时候，我还是感觉很害羞。我不知道这是为什么，我觉得我已经不是个小女孩了，他是如此地坦诚，如此地友好。有时，他也会摆出一副严肃的样子。他没有过多的时间来看望我们。我感觉到了这些，也就不好意思再去占用他的时间了。而安德烈·彼得罗维奇则恰恰相反。我可以跟他聊一整天。但他总是在说因萨罗夫。总是告诉我一些关于他的可怕的事情！昨晚我还看到他出现在我梦里，手里拿着一把匕首。好像在对我说：‘我要杀了你，然后再杀掉我自己！’这简直太荒谬了！","‘June….Andrei Petrovitch brings me books, but I can’t read them.I’m ashamed to confess it to him; but I don’t like to give back the books, tell lies, say I have read them.I feel that would mortify him.He is always watching me.He seems devoted to me.A very good man, Andrei Petrovitch….What is it I want?Why is my heart so heavy, so oppressed?Why do I watch the birds with envy as they fly past?I feel that I could fly with them, fly, where I don’t know, but far from here.And isn’t that desire sinful?I have here mother, father, home.Don’t I love them?No, I don’t love them, as I should like to love.It’s dreadful to put that in words, but it’s the truth.Perhaps I am a great sinner; perhaps that is why I am so sad, why I have no peace.Some hand seems laid on me, weighing me down, as though I were in prison, and the walls would fall on me directly.Why is it others don’t feel this?Whom shall I love, if I am cold to my own people?It’s clear, papa is right; he reproaches me for loving nothing but cats and dogs.I must think about that.I pray very little; I must pray…. Ah, I think I should know how to love!…I am still shy with Mr. Insarov.I don’t know why; I believe I’m not schoolgirlish generally, and he is so simple and kind.Sometimes he has a very serious face.He can’t give much thought to us.I feel that, and am ashamed in a way to take up his time.With Andrei Petrovitch it’s quite a different thing.I am ready to chat with him the whole day long.But he too always talks of Insarov.And such terrible facts he tells me about him!I saw him in a dream last night with a dagger in his hand.And he seemed to say to me, “I will kill you and I will kill myself!”What silliness!"
"“啊，如果有人这样对我说：‘你必须这样做！’要有一颗善心——这还不够，要多做善事……是的，这才是人生中最重要的事情。但是，要怎样做善事呢？哦，如果我能学会控制自己该多好啊！我不知道我为什么老是想起因萨罗夫先生。当他过来拜访，坐下来认真地听着时，他自己一点儿都不紧张，泰然自若，我看着他心里就会觉得很高兴，就是这样而已，当他离开以后，我会一直琢磨着他刚才所说的话，不断地埋怨着自己，甚至会感到失落。我不知道这是为什么。（他法语说得不好，但却并没有觉得不好意思——我很喜欢他这点。）然而，我总是对新结交的朋友想得很多。每次跟他讲话时，我就会突然想起我们的男管家，瓦西里，他曾从一个着火的茅草屋里救出一个上了年纪的瘸子，而自己也差点儿丢了性命。父亲夸他是个勇敢的人，母亲奖励了他五卢布，而我对他则佩服得五体投地。他有一张极其平凡的面孔——甚至看起来有点儿愚蠢——后来他却嗜酒如命……","‘Oh, if some one would say to me: “There, that’s what you must do!”Being good—isn’t much; doing good… yes, that’s the great thing in life.But how is one to do good?Oh, if I could learn to control myself!I don’t know why I am so often thinking of Mr. Insarov.When he comes and sits and listens intently, but makes no effort, no exertion himself, I look at him, and feel pleased, and that’s all, and when he goes, I always go over his words, and feel vexed with myself, and upset even.I can’t tell why.(He speaks French badly and isn’t ashamed of it—I like that.)I always think a lot about new people, though.As I talked to him, I suddenly was reminded of our butler, Vassily, who rescued an old cripple out of a hut that was on fire, and was almost killed himself.Papa called him a brave fellow, mamma gave him five roubles, and I felt as though I could fall at his feet.And he had a simple face—stupid-looking even—and he took to drink later on…."
"“今天我给了一个女乞丐一便士，她对我说：‘你怎么看起来这样伤心？’我从来没想到我看起来会伤感。我猜想这可能是因为孤独的原因吧，不管我是善良还是邪恶，都是一样地孤单！没有人朝我伸出手来。那些靠近我的人，都不是我想要的，而我想接近的人——却一个个都离我远去。","‘I gave a penny to-day to a beggar woman, and she said to me, “Why are you so sorrowful?”I never suspected I looked sorrowful.I think it must come from being alone, always alone, for better, for worse!There is no one to stretch out a hand to me.Those who come to me, I don’t want; and those I would choose—pass me by."
"“……我不知道今天是怎么回事，我脑中十分混乱，我想跪在地上请求宽恕。我不知道是谁又如何让我这样难过，但我清楚我现在已经饱受折磨，我在心里叛逆地呐喊着，我泪流满面，内心无法平静……哦，我的上帝，请制止住我内心的这些纷乱吧！只有你才能挽救我，其他的都没有用，我那微不足道的施舍也好，那满腹经纶的学问也罢，所有的这一切都无法帮助我。我很想去某个地方当个佣人，真的，这样我就不会再难受了。","‘…I don’t know what’s the matter with me to-day; my head is confused, I want to fall on my knees and beg and pray for mercy.I don’t know by whom or how, but I feel as if I were being tortured, and inwardly I am shrieking in revolt; I weep and can’t be quiet….O my God, subdue these outbreaks in me!Thou alone canst aid me, all else is useless; my miserable alms-giving, my studies can do nothing, nothing, nothing to help me.I should like to go out as a servant somewhere, really; that would do me good."
"“我的青春应该怎样度过，我为何而活，我的灵魂该寄放在哪里，这一切都是为了什么？","‘What is my youth for, what am I living for, why have I a soul, what is it all for?"
"“……因萨罗夫，因萨罗夫先生——真的，我不知道该如何下笔——他一直都让我好奇，我很想知道，他内心里到底在想些什么？他看起来很坦诚、一副很容易交往的样子，但我却一点儿都不了解他。有时他会用那种探究的目光看着我——还是这只是我的猜想而已？保罗一直取笑我。我很不喜欢他。他到底想做什么？他爱上了我……但他的爱对我无益。他也爱上了卓娅。我不爱他，这对他不公平，昨天他还跟我说我从来都没喜欢过他……确实是这样。真是糟糕透顶了。","‘… Insarov, Mr. Insarov—upon my word I don’t know how to write—still interests me, I should like to know what he has within, in his soul?He seems so open, so easy to talk to, but I can see nothing.Sometimes he looks at me with such searching eyes—or is that my fancy?Paul keeps teasing me.I am angry with Paul.What does he want?He’s in love with me… but his love’s no good to me.He’s in love with Zoya too.I’m unjust to him; he told me yesterday I didn’t know how to be unjust by halves… that’s true.It’s very horrid."
"“啊，我觉得每个人都需要感受一下不幸、贫穷或是痛苦，否则我们很快就会自以为是的。","‘Ah, I feel one needs unhappiness, or poverty or sickness, or else one gets conceited directly."
"“……今天安德烈·彼得罗维奇为何会跟我讲那两个保加利亚人的事情呢！他好像是故意说给我听的。这跟我和因萨罗夫先生有什么关系呢？我对安德烈·彼得罗维奇的感觉有些复杂。","‘… What made Andrei Petrovitch tell me to-day about those two Bulgarians!He told me it as it were with some intention.What have I to do with Mr. Insarov?I feel cross with Andrei Petrovitch."
"“……我拿起笔却不知道该写些什么。今天实在是太意外了，他竟然在花园里主动跟我聊天！他这个人是多么地友好，多么地让人信赖啊！这件事发生得太突然了！就好像我们以前就已相识，只是刚刚才认出对方而已。我以前怎么没能了解他啊？此刻他跟我是如此地亲近！而这——实在是太美好了——现在我内心里感觉到一种从来没有过的平静。真是可笑，昨天我还生着安德烈·彼得罗维奇的气，对他感到很是不满，甚至我还叫他因萨罗夫先生，可是今天……至少他是一个坦诚的人，一个可以让人信赖的男人。他从来都不骗人，他是我碰到的第一个不会说谎的人，其他的人都在撒谎，说着各种各样的假话。安德烈·彼得罗维奇，他是一个很好的朋友，为什么我要伤害他呢？不！安德烈·彼得罗维奇要比他更加有学问，或许比他还聪明些。然而我不明白的是，他在因萨罗夫旁边竟然看起来那么渺小。当他谈到自己的祖国时，他的形象立马高大了起来，他的脸孔看起来神采奕奕，他的声音听起来如钢铁般坚强，同时……不……彷佛这世上没有人可以将他打倒。他不是只在口头上说说而已……他已付诸了行动，而且将会继续下去，我想问问他……他突然转过头来朝我笑了笑！只有和兄弟之间才有这样的微笑！啊，我实在是太兴奋了！当他第一次前来拜访时，我怎么没有想到我们的关系会发展得如此迅速。现在，我甚至还为我第一次见到他时表现出来的冷淡而感到高兴。冷淡？难道我现在对他不冷淡了吗？很长时间我的内心都没有如此平静了。我感到很平静，很平静。没有什么可写了吗？我经常看到他，仅此而已。还有什么可写的呢？","‘… I take my pen and don’t know how to begin.How unexpectedly he began to talk to me in the garden to-day!How friendly and confiding he was!How quickly it happened!As if we were old, old friends and had only just recognised each other.How could I have not understood him before?How near he is to me now!And—what’s so wonderful—I feel ever so much calmer now.It’s ludicrous; yesterday I was angry with Andrei Petrovitch, and angry with him, I even called him Mr. Insarov, and to-day…Here at last is a true man; some one one may depend upon.He won’t tell lies; he’s the first man I have met who never tells lies; all the others tell lies, everything’s lying.Andrei Petrovitch, dear good friend, why do I wrong you?No! Andrei Petrovitch is more learned than he is, even, perhaps more intellectual.But I don’t know, he seems so small beside him.When he speaks of his country he seems taller, and his face grows handsome, and his voice is like steel, and… no… it seems as though there were no one in the world before whom he would flinch.And he doesn’t only talk…. he has acted and he will act I shall ask him…. How suddenly he turned to me and smiled!…It’s only brothers that smile like that!Ah, how glad I am!When he came the first time, I never dreamt that we should so soon get to know each other.And now I am even pleased that I remained indifferent to him at first.Indifferent? Am I not indifferent then now?…It’s long since I have felt such inward peace.I feel so quiet, so quiet.And there’s nothing to write?I see him often and that’s all.What more is there to write?"
"“……保罗把自己关了起来，安德烈·彼得罗维奇也不经常过来了……可怜的家伙们！我感觉他……然而这是不可能的事情。我喜欢跟安德烈·彼得罗维奇交谈，他总是避免谈自己，经常聊一些切合实际的、有用处的事情。这跟舒宾完全不同。舒宾总是像只蝴蝶似的穿得十分完美，并引以为傲，而蝴蝶们是不会这样做的。然而舒宾和安德烈·彼得罗维奇这两个人……我很清楚我的想法。","‘… Paul shuts himself up, Andrei Petrovitch has taken to coming less often…. poor fellow!I fancy he…But that can never be, though.I like talking to Andrei Petrovitch; never a word of self, always of something sensible, useful.Very different from Shubin.Shubin’s as fine as a butterfly, and admires his own finery; which butterflies don’t do.But both Shubin and Andrei Petrovitch….I know what I mean."
"“……他很喜欢过来拜访我们，我是知道的。但是为什么呢？他从我这里发现了什么？的确，我们志趣相投，我和他两个人都不怎么喜欢诗歌，我们也都不懂艺术。但是，他要比我强许多！他一直都很平静，但我却总是心神不宁，他已经选择了自己的道路，自己的目标——但我呢——我该何去何从？哪里才是我的归宿？他沉着冷静，但是他所有的想法都很遥远。有那么一天，他将会永远地离开我们，越过大海，回到自己的祖国。这该怎么办呢？愿上帝祝福他！然而不管怎样，我还是很高兴能够认识他，很高兴他还在这里。","‘… He enjoys coming to us, I see that.But why?what does he find in me?It’s true our tastes are alike; he and I, both of us don’t care for poetry; neither of us knows anything of art. But how much better he is than I!He is calm, I am in perpetual excitement; he has chosen his path, his aim—while I—where am I going?where is my home?He is calm, but all his thoughts are far away.The time will come, and he will leave us for ever, will go home, there over the sea.Well?God grant he may!Any way I shall be glad that I knew him, while he was here."
"“为什么他不是俄国人呢？不，他怎么可能是俄国人啊。”","‘Why isn’t he a Russian?No, he could not be Russian."
"“母亲也很喜欢他，说他是一位虚心的年轻人。亲爱的母亲！她并不了解他。保罗什么话也不说，他已经猜到了我不喜欢他的暗示，但是他很嫉妒他。令人反感的家伙！不过他为何会这样？难道我曾经……这些事情简直太荒谬了！我怎么会想到这些东西呢？","‘Mamma too likes him; she says: an unassuming young man.Dear mamma!She does not understand him.Paul says nothing; he guessed I didn’t like his hints, but he’s jealous of him.Spiteful boy!And what right has he?Did I ever…All that’s nonsense!What makes all that come into my head?"
"“……然而这是不是有点儿奇怪啊，我现在已经二十岁了，但却从来没有喜欢上一个人！我觉得德（我称呼他为德——我很喜欢德米特里这个名字）内心十分淡定的原因就在于他把自己完完全全地奉献给了自己的事业，自己的理想。这样他还有什么可烦心的事呢？当一个人完完全全地……完完全全地……把自己奉献出去的时候，那么他就没有什么事情可担忧了。如此一来，就不是我想怎么做了，而且它需要我做些什么。顺便说一下，我和他两个人都很喜欢同一种花。今天早上我摘了一朵玫瑰，一片花瓣落在了地上，他就把它捡了起来……然后我就将整朵花送给了他。","‘… Isn’t it strange though, that up till now, up to twenty, I have never loved any one!I believe that the reason why D.’s (I shall call him D.—I like that name Dmitri) soul is so clear, is that he is entirely given up to his work, his ideal.What has he to trouble about?When any one has utterly… utterly… given himself up, he has little sorrow, he is not responsible for anything.It’s not I want, but it wants.By the way, he and I both love the same flowers.I picked a rose this morning, one leaf fell, he picked it up….I gave him the whole rose."
"“……德经常过来拜访我们。昨天整个晚上他都在这里。他想教我保加利亚语。跟他在一起我很快乐，就像在家里一样，比呆在家里还有趣。","‘… D. often comes to us.Yesterday he spent the whole evening.He wants to teach me Bulgarian.I feel happy with him, quite at home, more than at home."
"“……时间过得真快……我很开心，但不知为何内心会感到不满，我很感激上苍，我快要掉泪了。哦，多么热闹、多么美好的日子啊！","‘… The days fly past….I am happy, and somehow discontent and I am thankful to God, and tears are not far off.Oh these hot bright days!"
"“……我还是跟以前那样开心快乐，但偶尔也会觉得有点儿感伤。我很开心。我真的开心吗？","‘… I am still light-hearted as before, and only at times, and only a little, sad.I am happy.Am I happy?"
"“……昨天的远足我会牢记在心的。当他猛地抓住那个巨人，像丢皮球似的把他扔到水里的时候，给我留下了极其奇特、新奇又可怕的印象。我并没有因此而感到害怕……但是他却吓到了我。随后——他的脸色变得十分可怕，几乎达到了残忍的地步！他那样说道：‘他自己会游上来的！’这让我十分震惊。很明显，我还是不了解他。接着，当大家都笑起来的时候，我也跟着笑了，我替他感到难过！他有点儿不好意思，我感觉到他在我面前有点儿难为情。当夜晚降临的时候，他在马车里给我说了这些，当时我试图好好地了解一下他，对他我感到有点儿害怕。是的，千万不能戏弄他，他是个强大的战士。然而，他为何会有那样邪恶的面孔，颤抖的双唇和那眼中的怒火呢？或许，这是不可避免的吧？难道和蔼的人就不能成为一个男子汉，不能成为英雄吗？‘生活是残忍的。’他曾经对我说过。我给安德烈·彼得罗维奇重复了这句话，他没有同意德的说法。他们到底谁对呢？但那一天开始的时候！我很高兴能跟他一起走着，即使不说一句话。……不过，对已经发生过的事情，我感到很高兴。我觉得那是很正常的事情。","‘… It will be long before I forget the expedition yesterday.What strange, new, terrible impressions when he suddenly took that great giant and flung him like a ball into the water.I was not frightened … yet he frightened me.And afterwards—what an angry face, almost cruel!How he said, “He will swim out!”It gave me a shock.So I did not understand him.And afterwards when they all laughed, when I was laughing, how I felt for him!He was ashamed, I felt that he was ashamed before me.He told me so afterwards in the carriage in the dark, when I tried to get a good view of him and was afraid of him.Yes, he is not to be trifled with, and he is a splendid champion.But why that wicked look, those trembling lips, that angry fire in his eyes?Or is it, perhaps, inevitable?Isn’t it possible to be a man, a hero, and to remain soft and gentle?“Life is a coarse business,” he said to me once lately.I repeated that saying to Andrei Petrovitch; he did not agree with D. Which of them is right?But the beginning of that day!How happy I was, walking beside him, even without speaking.… But I am glad of what happened.I see that it was quite as it should be."
"“……心里又开始烦躁了……我感到很不舒服……这几天我一点儿日记都没写，因为我没有写的冲动。我觉得，不管我写什么，都不是我内心里的真实想法。……我心里到底在想些什么呢？有一次我跟他谈了很长时间，让我明白了很多事情。他告诉了我他的梦想（顺便说一下，我直到现在才知道他脖子上为何会有那样的一条伤疤……天哪！我一想到他竟然被判过死刑，然后被救了出来，但却受了重伤……）他预言说战争一触即发，并为此感到愉快。然而，我却从来没有见过德会如此地失落。他怎能……他！……失落什么呢？父亲从城里回来，刚好遇到我们两个。他有些奇怪地看着我们。安德烈·彼得罗维奇也过来了，我发现他这段时间瘦了很多，面色苍白。他曾埋怨过我，责怪我对舒宾太冷淡、太不上心了。我已经完全忘记了保罗的存在。以后若是能遇到他，再慢慢地弥补吧。他现在对我来说可有可无……其他人也一样。安德烈·彼得罗维奇跟我说话的时候带着一股伤感的语调。这意味着什么呢？为什么我周围的一切和我的内心都这样地难以捉摸？我好像感觉到在我的周围及内心里，有一个不可捉摸的谜团正在潜滋暗长，而我正在试图找到谜底……我整夜都无法入眠，我的头很疼。写作有什么好处呢？今天他很快就离开了，而我却想跟他谈谈……他好像在故意躲着我。是的，他在躲着我。","‘… Restlessness again…I am not quite well….All these days I have written nothing in this book, because I have had no wish to write.I felt, whatever I write, it won’t be what is in my heart.… And what is in my heart?I have had a long talk with him, which revealed a great deal.He told me his plan (by the way, I know now how he got the wound in his neck….Good God!when I think he was actually condemned to death, that he was only just saved, that he was wounded…. ) He prophesies war and will be glad of it.And for all that, I never saw D. so depressed.What can he…he!… be depressed by?Papa arrived home from town and came upon us two.He looked rather queerly at us.Andrei Petrovitch came; I noticed he had grown very thin and pale.He reproved me, saying I behave too coldly and inconsiderately to Shubin.I had utterly forgotten Paul’s existence.I will see him, and try to smooth over my offence.He is nothing to me now… nor any one else in the world.Andrei Petrovitch talked to me in a sort of commiserating way.What does it all mean?Why is everything around me and within me so dark?I feel as if about me and within me, something mysterious were happening, for which I want to find the right word….I did not sleep all night; my head aches.What’s the good of writing?He went away so quickly to-day and I wanted to talk to him….He almost seems to avoid me.Yes, he avoids me."
"“……我找到了答案，我终于明白了！哦，上帝，同情同情我吧……我爱上了他！”","‘… The word is found, light has dawned on me!My God, have pity on me….I love him!’"
"第十七章","CHAPTER XVII"
"也就在那一天，当埃琳娜把她生命中最重要的一句话写进日记中的时候，因萨罗夫正坐在别尔谢涅夫的房间里，而别尔谢涅夫则一脸困惑地站在他的面前。因萨罗夫刚和他提到自己打算第二天就回莫斯科的想法。","On the very day on which Elena had written this last fatal line in her diary, Insarov was sitting in Bersenyev’s room, and Bersenyev was standing before him with a look of perplexity on his face.Insarov had just announced his intention of returning to Moscow the next day."
"“听我说！”别尔谢涅夫叫道，“为什么啊，夏天最美好的时光才刚刚开始。你回莫斯科干什么？这决定实在是太突然了！或者是你听到了什么消息？”","‘Upon my word!’ cried Bersenyev.‘Why, the finest part of the summer is just beginning.What will you do in Moscow?What a sudden decision!Or have you had news of some sort?’"
"“我没有听到什么，”因萨罗夫回答说，“然而我考虑再三，我觉得我不适合生活在这里。”","‘I have had no news,’ replied Insarov; ‘but on thinking things over, I find I cannot stop here.’"
"“这怎么可能呢？”","‘How can that be?’"
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇，”因萨罗夫说，“你就行行好吧……请别再坚持了，我很遗憾不能再和你住在一起，但是只能这样了。”","‘Andrei Petrovitch,’ said Insarov, ‘be so kind… don’t insist, please, I am very sorry myself to be leaving you, but it can’t be helped.’"
"别尔谢涅夫目不转睛地盯着他。","Bersenyev looked at him intently."
"“我知道，”他最后说道，“我也不再劝你了。那么，就这样吧。”","‘I know,’ he said at last, ‘there’s no persuading you.And so, it’s a settled matter.’"
"“确定要离开吗？”","‘Is it?’"
"“完全确定。”因萨罗夫回答说，站起身来走了出去。","‘Absolutely settled,’ replied Insarov, getting up and going away."
"别尔谢涅夫在房间里来回走着，然后拿起帽子就朝斯塔霍夫家赶去。","Bersenyev walked about the room, then took his hat and set off for the Stahovs."
"“你想跟我说些什么吧。”当房间里没有别人时，埃琳娜对他说道。","‘You have something to tell me,’ Elena said to him, directly they were left alone."
"“没错，你怎么猜到的？”","‘Yes, how did you guess?’"
"“这不重要，快告诉我发生了什么事情。”","‘Never mind; tell me what it is.’"
"别尔谢涅夫告诉了她因萨罗夫的打算。","Bersenyev told her of Insarov’s intention."
"埃琳娜惊得脸色苍白。","Elena turned white."
"“这是什么意思？”她吃力地说道。","‘What does it mean?’ she articulated with effort."
"“你知道的，”别尔谢涅夫说，“德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇从来不会向别人解释自己的行为的。但是我想……埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，我们先坐下，你看上去不太舒服……我想我已经猜到他突然离去的原因了。”","‘You know,’ observed Bersenyev, ‘Dmitri Nikanorovitch does not care to give reasons for his actions.But I think… let us sit down, Elena Nikolaevna, you don’t seem very well….I fancy I can guess what is the real cause of this sudden departure.’"
"“什么——什么原因？”埃琳娜重复着问，并无意识地用那冰凉的双手紧紧地攥着别尔谢涅夫的手。","‘What—what cause?’ repeated Elena, and unconsciously she gripped tightly Bersenyev’s hand in her chill ringers."
"“你知道的，”别尔谢涅夫开口说道，夹杂着一丝悲哀的笑容，“我怎么给你解释呢？我得从去年春天谈起，那时我跟因萨罗夫的关系刚开始密切起来。有一次，我在一位亲戚家中碰到了他，这位亲戚有一个漂亮的女儿，我感觉到因萨罗夫似乎对她有意思，然后我就把自己的想法说给他听。他听后哈哈大笑，直称我搞错了，还说自己情窦未开，假如碰到了这样的情况，他就会立马走开，因为他不愿意，按他自己的话说，为了感情上的事情而放弃了自己的理想和责任是不对的。“我是一个保加利亚人，”他说道，“我不需要一个俄国人的爱情……”","‘You see,’ began Bersenyev, with a pathetic smile, ’how can I explain to you?I must go back to last spring, to the time when I began to be more intimate with Insarov.I used to meet him then at the house of a relative, who had a daughter, a very pretty girl I thought that Insarov cared for her, and I told him so.He laughed, and answered that I was mistaken, that he was quite heart-whole, but if anything of that sort did happen to him, he should run away directly, as he did not want, in his own words, for the sake of personal feeling, to be false to his cause and his duty.“I am a Bulgarian,” he said, “and I have no need of a Russian love—”"
"“那……这样的话……现在您准备……”埃琳娜耳语到。她无意地转过头，就像一个受到重创的人，但是她依然紧握着她已经抓住的手。","‘Well—so—now you—’ whispered Elena.She involuntarily turned away her head, like a man expecting a blow, but she still held the hand she had clutched."
"“我认为，”他说道，声音渐渐低下去，“我认为我曾猜想的事情真的已经发生了。”","‘I think,’ he said, and his own voice sank, ‘I think that what I fancied then has really happened now.’"
"“那……您认为……不要再折磨我了！”埃琳娜突然说道。","‘That is—you think—don’t torture me!’ broke suddenly from Elena."
"“我觉得，”别尔谢涅夫接着说道，“因萨罗夫现在爱上了一个俄国女孩，因此为了兑现他的诺言，他决心打算要走了。”","‘I think,’ Bersenyev continued hurriedly, ‘that Insarov is in love now with a Russian girl, and he is resolved to go, according to his word.’"
"埃琳娜将他的手握得更紧了，她的头也垂得更低，就像要把她那因羞愧而涨红的脸和脖子都从众人的目光中隐藏起来。","Elena clasped his hand still tighter, and her head drooped still lower, as if she would hide from other eyes the flush of shame which suddenly blazed over her face and neck."
"“安德烈·彼得罗维奇，你真的如天使般善良，”她说，“但是，他还会来跟我们告别吗？”","‘Andrei Petrovitch, you are kind as an angel,’ she said, ‘but will he come to say goodbye?’"
"“是的，我觉得他肯定会来的。他其实不想走……”","‘Yes, I imagine so; he will be sure to come.He wouldn’t like to go away—’"
"“告诉他，告诉他……’","‘Tell him, tell him—’"
"但是现在这个可怜的女孩已经情绪崩溃了，眼泪从眼眶中滑落，她跑了出去。","But here the poor girl broke down; tears rushed streaming from her eyes, and she ran out of the room."
"“她是多么地爱他啊”，别尔谢涅夫一边想着，一边慢慢地向家里走去，“我没有想到是这样的，我没有想到她的感情如此地强烈。她说我很善良，”他回忆着，“谁能告诉我是什么感情让我将这件事情告诉埃琳娜的？肯定不是因为善良，不，肯定不是的。这全是因为我强烈地想确信这把匕首是否真的插在了伤口上。我现在该满意了。他们是那么地相爱，我却利用了他们……未来在科学和俄国公众之间的中间人，舒宾曾这样叫我，现在看来似乎不管天意如何，我都必须要做个中间人了。但是如果我弄错了呢？不，我不会弄错的……”","‘So that’s how she loves him,’ thought Bersenyev, as he walked slowly home.‘I didn’t expect that; I didn’t think she felt so strongly.I am kind, she says.’ he pursued his reflections:… ‘Who can tell what feelings, what impulse drove me to tell Elena all that?It was not kindness; no, not kindness.It was all the accursed desire to make sure whether the dagger is really in the wound.I ought to be content.They love each other, and I have been of use to them….The future go-between between science and the Russian public Shubin calls me; it seems as though it had been decreed at my birth that I should be a go-between.But if I’m mistaken?No, I’m not mistaken—’"
"这令安德烈·彼得罗维奇觉得苦闷，也使得他不会再注意到劳默尔了。","It was bitter for Andrei Petrovitch, and he could not turn his mind to Raumer."
"第二天下午两点，因萨罗夫来到斯塔霍夫家。就像设计好的一样，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的客厅里有位客人，是邻居牧师的太太，一位优秀杰出的女人，尽管她和警察有些不愉快，因为她执意要在一天中最热的时候，到路旁的湖里沐浴，而一位严肃的将军的家眷总是常常经过那里。一位客人的存在起初对于埃琳娜甚至是一种解放，可因为听到了因萨罗夫的脚步声，她脸上变得毫无血色；但是，想到他告别的时候可能没有机会与她单独说话，她的心一沉。他看起来也有些烦躁，逃避着她的眼光。“他一定不会马上就走吧，”埃琳娜暗想。但事实上，因萨罗夫已经转身去跟安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜道别了，埃琳娜急忙站起来，叫他到窗边去。牧师的夫人很意外，她也想转身，但是她被衣服勒得很紧以至于每动一下就发出咯吱咯吱的声音，所以她还是坐在原来的位置上。","The next day at two o’clock Insarov arrived at the Stahovs’.As though by express design, there was a visitor in Anna Vassilyevna’s drawing-room at the time, the wife of a neighbouring chief-priest, an excellent and worthy woman, though she had had a little unpleasantness with the police, because she thought fit, in the hottest part of the day, to bathe in a lake near the road, along which a certain dignified general’s family used often to be passing.The presence of an outside person was at first even a relief to Elena, from whose face every trace of colour vanished, directly she heard Insarov’s step; but her heart sank at the thought that he might go without a word with her alone.He, too, seemed confused, and avoided meeting her eyes.‘Surely he will not go directly,’ thought Elena.Insarov was, in fact, turning to take leave of Anna Vassilyevna; Elena hastily rose and called him aside to the window.The priest’s wife was surprised, and tried to turn round; but she was so tightly laced that her stays creaked at every movement, and she stayed where she was."
"“听着，”埃琳娜急促地说，“我知道你是来干什么的，安德烈·彼得罗维奇已经把你的决定告诉我了，但是我请求你，我请求你今天别跟我们告别，你明天上午早一点，十一点再来吧。我有些话要跟您说。”","‘Listen,’ said Elena hurriedly; ‘I know what you have come for; Andrei Petrovitch told me of your intention, but I beg, I entreat you, do not say good-bye to us to-day, but come here to-morrow rather earlier, at eleven.I must have a few words with you.’"
"因萨罗夫没有说话，只是低下了头。","Insarov bent his head without speaking."
"“我不会强留你的……你能答应我吗？”","‘I will not keep you….You promise me?’"
"因萨罗夫又一次垂下了头，但是还是没说一句话。","Again Insarov bowed, but said nothing."
"“列诺奇卡，快过来，”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜说，“快看看，多漂亮的手提包啊。”","‘Lenotchka, come here,’ said Anna Vassilyevna, ‘look, what a charming reticule.’"
"“这是我自己亲手做的。”牧师夫人回答道。","‘I worked it myself,’ observed the priest’s wife."
"埃琳娜从窗户旁边走过来了。","Elena came away from the window."
"因萨罗夫在斯塔霍夫家还没呆到十五分钟。埃琳娜一直安静地看着他。他坐立不安，显得很拘束。像以前一样，他并不知道该望向哪里，然后突然地离开了，似乎就那么消失不见了。","Insarov did not stay more than a quarter of an hour at the Stahovs’.Elena watched him secretly.He was restless and ill at ease.As before, he did not know where to look, and he went away strangely and suddenly; he seemed to vanish."
"这一天对于埃琳娜来说很漫长，慢慢长夜就更加难熬。埃琳娜坐在她的床上，胳膊搭在膝盖上，垂着头；有时候她来到窗户旁，将滚烫的额头靠在冰冷的玻璃上；翻来覆去想了又想，直到自己精疲力尽。她的心变得如石头般坚硬，只是自己未感觉到，但是她头里的血管却在痛苦地跳动着，头发让她烦闷，嘴唇也很干燥。“他肯定会来的……他还没跟妈妈告别呢……他不会骗我的……难道安德烈·彼得罗维奇是对的吗？不会的……他并没有直接答应我要来……我们此生就不能再相见了吗？”这些想法从未离开过她，周而复始地困扰着她，就像是一团迷雾一直盘旋在她的心中。“他是爱我的！”这个念头突然在她大脑中闪过，点燃了她内心的火焰，她凝视着黑夜，一丝不易察觉的微笑绽放在她的唇边，但她马上又甩了甩头，将双手枕在脑后，之前的那个念头，又似乎烟消云散了。天亮前她才脱下衣服，到床上去，但是她却无法入睡。第一缕阳光射进了她的房间……“哦，假如他是真的爱我呢！”她突然喊道，张开怀抱，让阳光照耀着她，再也不感到害羞。她起床，穿上衣服，走下楼去。家里还没有人起床。她走到花园中，那里很安静，满眼绿色，空气清新，小鸟们欢快地歌唱着，花朵们兴奋地仰着头四处张望，但这一切却无法让她感到欢喜。“哦！”她想着，“如果这是真的，我就会比这些花草更愉快，但是这会是真的吗？”她回到了房间去打发时间，她开始换裙子。但是那些裙子都从她手中滑落，她仍衣衫不整地坐在梳妆镜前，直到佣人叫她下去喝早茶。她走下楼去，母亲注意到她脸色苍白，但只是说道：“你今天很有趣啊，”上下打量着她后，又继续说道，“这套裙子真的很适合你啊，如果想让别人欣赏你，你就应该常常穿着它。”埃琳娜什么都没说，在一个角落里坐下。这个时候，钟敲响了九点钟，距离十一点只有两个小时了。埃琳娜尝试去看书，然后去刺绣，然后又拿起书本，接着她强迫自己在小道上来回走了一百遍；再然后，她耐心地注视着安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜摆牌阵……时而看看钟，还没到十点。舒宾走进了客厅。她想与他交谈，来请求他的原谅，但她自己也不知道她哪里做错了……她说的每一句话都并没有让她感到为难，但却让她自己产生了一种诧异的感觉。舒宾向她弯下腰。她就觉得那是在愚弄她，她的眼前浮现的是一张悲伤而怜悯的脸……她对着这张脸微笑，舒宾也笑了，没有说一句话就安静地走了。她打算挽留他，但却想不起来该怎样称呼他。最后终于到十一点。于是她开始等待，等待，而且竖起耳朵听着。她现在做不了任何别的事，连思考都停止了。她的心又一次躁动，跳得越来越快，令人奇怪的是，时间转瞬即逝。一刻钟过去了，半小时过去了，像埃琳娜想的那样，又几分钟过去了，当她突然站起来时，时钟敲响了，不是十二点，而是下午一点。“他没有来，他没有告别就走了。”这个念头令血液一下子涌进她的大脑里。她觉得自己无法呼吸，仿佛下一刻就要哭出来似的。她冲到自己的房间，躺在床上双手掩面。","Slowly passed that day for Elena; still more slowly dragged on the long, long night.Elena sat on her bed, her arms clasping her knees, and her head laid on them; then she walked to the window, pressed her burning forehead against the cold glass, and thought and thought, going over and over the same thoughts till she was exhausted.Her heart seemed turned to stone, she did not feel it, but the veins in her head throbbed painfully, her hair stifled her, and her lips were dry.‘He will come… he did not say good-bye to mamma… he will not deceive me…Can Andrei Petrovitch have been right?It cannot be…He didn’t promise to come in words…Can I have parted from him for ever—?’ Those were the thoughts that never left her, literally never left her; they did not come and come again; they were for ever turning like a mist moving about in her brain.‘He loves me!’ suddenly flashed through her, setting her whole nature on fire, and she gazed fixedly into the darkness; a secret smile parted her lips, seen by none, but she quickly shook her head, and clasped her hands behind her neck, and again her former thought hung like a mist about her.Before morning she undressed and went to bed, but she could not sleep.The first fiery ray of sunlight fell upon her room…‘Oh, if he loves me!’ she cried suddenly, and unabashed by the light shining on her, she opened wide her arms…She got up, dressed, and went down.No one in the house was awake yet.She went into the garden, but in the garden it was peaceful, green, and fresh; the birds chirped so confidingly, and the flowers peeped out so gaily that she could not bear it.‘Oh!’ she thought, ‘if it is true, no blade of grass is happy as I. But is it true?’She went back to her room and, to kill time, she began changing her dress.But everything slipped out of her hands, and she was still sitting half-dressed before her looking-glass when she was summoned to morning tea.She went down; her mother noticed her pallor, but only said: ‘How interesting you are to-day,’ and taking her in in a glance, she added: ‘How well that dress suits you; you should always put it on when you want to make an impression on any one.’Elena made no reply, and sat down in a corner.Meanwhile it struck nine o’ clock; there were only two hours now till eleven.Elena tried to read, then to sew, then to read again, then she vowed to herself to walk a hundred times up and down one alley, and paced it a hundred times; then for a long time she watched Anna Vassilyevna laying out the cards for patience… and looked at the clock; it was not yet ten.Shubin came into the drawing-room.She tried to talk to him, and begged his pardon, what for she did not know herself….Every word she uttered did not cost her effort exactly, but roused a kind of amazement in herself.Shubin bent over her.She expected ridicule, raised her eyes, and saw before her a sorrowful and sympathetic face….She smiled at this face.Shubin, too, smiled at her without speaking, and gently left her.She tried to keep him, but could not at once remember what to call him.At last it struck eleven.Then she began to wait, to wait, and to listen.She could do nothing now; she ceased even to think.Her heart was stirred into life again, and began beating louder and louder, and strange, to say, the time seemed flying by.A quarter of an hour passed, then half an hour; a few minutes more, as Elena thought, had passed, when suddenly she started; the clock had struck not twelve, but one.‘He is not coming; he is going away without saying good-bye.’… The blood rushed to her head with this thought.She felt that she was gasping for breath, that she was on the point of sobbing….She ran to her own room, and fell with her face in her clasped hands on to the bed."
"整整半个小时她一动不动，眼泪透过手指缝隙流到了枕头上。突然，她坐了起来，一个奇怪的念头划过她的大脑，她的脸色变了，湿润的眼睛也干了，开始发出光芒，眉头紧锁，嘴唇也绷紧了。又半个小时过去了。埃琳娜，最后一次竖起耳朵聆听，那个熟悉的声音会不会再次响起？她站起来，戴上帽子和手套，将披肩围在肩膀上，无声地走出了房间，她快速地走在通往别尔谢涅夫公寓的路上。","For half an hour she lay motionless; the tears flowed through her fingers on to the pillow.Suddenly she raised herself and sat up, something strange was passing in her, her face changed, her wet eyes grew dry and shining, her brows were bent and her lips compressed.Another half-hour passed.Elena, for the last time, strained her ears to listen: was not that the familiar voice floating up to her?She got up, put on her hat and gloves, threw a cape over her shoulders, and, slipping unnoticed out of the house, she went with swift steps along the road leading to Bersenyev’s lodging."
"第十八章","CHAPTER XVIII"
"埃琳娜埋头走着，眼睛直直地盯着前方的路。她什么都不怕，什么都不在乎，只是想再见因萨罗夫一面。她继续走着，没有注意到太阳早已躲进厚厚的乌云后面，不见了；风在树林里咆哮着，将她的连衣裙吹来吹去；尘土猛地被吹起，像云团一般在路上飞来飞去……她甚至都没有注意到天上下起了大滴大滴的雨。但是，雨点越下越大，越下越密，还伴有一道道闪电和一声声雷鸣。埃琳娜静静地站着，看着四周……幸运的是，在一口已经干涸的水井旁有一座年久失修的小教堂，离她遭遇暴雨的地点不远。她跑过去，躲到低矮的屋檐下。大雨如注，天空也完全被乌云所笼罩。埃琳娜注视着如注的雨水，感到无比绝望。想和因萨罗夫见一面的最后心愿越来越渺茫。一个身材矮小、要饭的老太太走进小教堂，抖了抖身上的雨水，行了个礼说：“避避雨吧，好姑娘。”她一边呻吟、叹息，一边坐在了水井旁边的一块岩石上。埃琳娜把一只手伸进口袋里。老太太注意到了这个动作，她那曾经美丽现在却颜色蜡黄、皱纹满面的脸庞上突然有了一道光。“谢谢你了，好心的姑娘。”她开口说道。埃琳娜口袋里刚好没有钱包，但是老太太仍然伸着一只手。","Elena walked with her head bent and her eyes fixed straight before her.She feared nothing, she considered nothing; she wanted to see Insarov once more.She went on, not noticing that the sun had long ago disappeared behind heavy black clouds, that the wind was roaring by gusts in the trees and blowing her dress about her, that the dust had suddenly risen and was flying in a cloud along the road….Large drops of rain were falling, she did not even notice it; but it fell faster and heavier, there were flashes of lightning and peals of thunder.Elena stood still looking round….Fortunately for her, there was a little old broken-down chapel that had been built over a disused well not far from the place where she was overtaken by the storm.She ran to it and got under the low roof.The rain fell in torrents; the sky was completely overcast.In dumb despair Elena stared at the thick network of fast-falling drops.Her last hope of getting a sight of Insarov was vanishing.A little old beggar-woman came into the chapel, shook herself, said with a curtsy: ‘Out of the rain, good lady,’ and with many sighs and groans sat down on a ledge near the well.Elena put her hand into her pocket; the old woman noticed this action and a light came into her face, yellow and wrinkled now, though once handsome.‘Thank you, dear gracious lady,’ she was beginning.There happened to be no purse in Elena’s pocket, but the old woman was still holding out her hand."
"“我没有带钱，老奶奶，”埃琳娜说，“但是，请您拿着这个吧，它会有用的。”","‘I have no money, grannie,’ said Elena, ‘but here, take this, it will be of use for something.’"
"她把自己的手帕给了老太太。","She gave her her handkerchief."
"“哦，可爱的姑娘，”要饭的说道，“你给我你的手帕干什么呢？作为我孙女结婚时给她的结婚礼物吗？上帝会奖励你的善良的！”","‘O-oh, my pretty lady,’ said the beggar, ‘what do you give your handkerchief to me for?For a wedding-present to my grandchild when she’s married?God reward you for your goodness!’"
"一阵雷声响起。","A peal of thunder was heard."
"“我主耶稣基督。”要饭的老太太默念着，在胸前划了三次十字，“咦，我以前见过你。”她顿了顿说道。“你以耶稣之名给过我施舍的，还记得吗？”","‘Lord Jesus Christ,’ muttered the beggar-woman, and she crossed herself three times.‘Why, haven’t I seen you before,’ she added after a brief pause.‘Didn’t you give me alms in Christ’s name?’"
"埃琳娜仔细打量了一下这个老太太，然后认出了她。","Elena looked more attentively at the old woman and recognised her."
"“没错，老奶奶，”她回答道，“您那时是不是还问过我为什么那么伤心？”","‘Yes, grannie,’ she answered, ‘wasn’t it you asked me why I was so sorrowful?’"
"“没错，亲爱的，我问过。我就觉得我认识你。我觉得你还在心痛。你看起来很困扰啊。还有你的手帕，肯定也是被泪水弄湿的。哎，你们这些年轻人都有着同样的伤心事。它确实让人很痛苦。”","‘Yes, darling, yes.I fancied I knew you.And I think you’ve a heart-ache still.You seem in trouble now.Here’s your handkerchief, too, wet from tears to be sure.Oh, you young people, you all have the same sorrow, a terrible woe it is!’"
"“什么样的伤心事，老奶奶？”","‘What sorrow, grannie?’"
"“哎，我的好姑娘，你可骗不了像我这么大岁数的老太太。我知道你为什么而痛苦，大多数人都会经历这种痛苦。当然了，亲爱的，我也曾年轻过。我也曾经遇到过这样的麻烦。没错。看在你对我如此善意的份儿上，我告诉你一些事吧：你已经赢得了一个好男人的心，这爱很深，你只依恋他一个，宁死也要跟着他。如果成了，那就成了——如果不成，那也是上帝的旨意。没错。你为什么疑惑地看着我呢？我是个算命的。现在，我将把你的伤悲和你的手帕一起带走。我会把它们一起带走，一切都结束了。你看，雨下小了，你再等一下吧。这也不是我第一次淋雨了。记住，亲爱的，你有过悲伤，但悲伤已经飞走了，你的记忆里不再有悲伤了。仁慈的上帝啊，请保佑我们吧！”","‘Ah, my good young lady, you can’t deceive an old woman like me.I know what your heart is heavy over; your sorrow’s not an uncommon one.Sure, I have been young too, darling.I have been through that trouble too.Yes.And I’ll tell you something, for your goodness to me; you’ve won a good man, not a light of love, you cling to him alone; cling to him stronger than death.If it comes off, it comes off,—if not, it’s in God’s hands.Yes.Why are you wondering at me?I’m a fortune-teller.There, I’ll carry away your sorrow with your handkerchief.I’ll carry it away, and it’s over.See the rain’s less; you wait a little longer.It’s not the first time I’ve been wet.Remember, darling; you had a sorrow, the sorrow has flown, and there’s no memory of it.Good Lord, have mercy on us!’"
"要饭的老太太从井边站起来，离开小教堂，步履蹒跚地向前走着。埃琳娜充满迷惑地看着她的背影。“这是什么意思呢？”她不自觉地嘟囔着。","The beggar-woman got up from the edge of the well, went out of the chapel, and stole off on her way.Elena stared after her in bewilderment.‘What does this mean?’ she murmured involuntarily."
"雨越下越小，有那么一瞬，太阳也向外瞥了几眼。埃琳娜正准备从避雨的地方走出去……突然，就在离小教堂十步之遥的地方，她看见了因萨罗夫。他披着斗篷，沿着埃琳娜来时的路走着，看起来正在往家里赶。","The rain grew less and less, the sun peeped out for an instant.Elena was just preparing to leave her shelter….Suddenly, ten paces from the chapel, she saw Insarov.Wrapt in a cloak he was walking along the very road by which Elena had come; he seemed to be hurrying home."
"她抓紧台阶的旧栏杆作为支撑，想要叫住他，却叫不出声……因萨罗夫已经埋着头走过去了。","She clasped the old rail of the steps for support, and tried to call to him, but her voice failed her…Insarov had already passed by without raising his head."
"“德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇！”她最后还是叫了一声。","‘Dmitri Nikanorovitch!’ she said at last."
"因萨罗夫猛地停住脚步，扭头一看……一开始他没有认出是埃琳娜，但是他立刻向她走了过来。“你！你在这里！”他叫道。","Insarov stopped abruptly, looked round….For the first minute he did not know Elena, but he went up to her at once.‘You! you here!’ he cried."
"她一声不吭地走回了小教堂。因萨罗夫跟着她。“你在这里？”他重复道。","She walked back in silence into the chapel.Insarov followed Elena.‘You here?’ he repeated."
"她依然未吭一声，只是用一种陌生、缓慢却深情的眼光注视着他。他闭上了眼睛。","She was still silent, and only gazed upon him with a strange, slow, tender look.He dropped his eyes."
"“你从我家过来？”她问道。","‘You have come from our house?’ she asked."
"“不……不是从你家里。”","‘No… not from your house.’"
"“不是？”埃琳娜重复着，她试图微笑，“你就是这样履行诺言的吗？我从早上开始就在等你了。”","‘No?’ repeated Elena, and she tried to smile.‘Is that how you keep your promises?I have been expecting you ever since the morning.’"
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，你应该没有忘记，我昨天并没有许下任何诺言。”","‘I made no promise yesterday, if you remember, Elena Nikolaevna.’"
"埃琳娜又微微一笑，用手擦了一把脸。她的面孔和手都那么苍白。","Again Elena faintly smiled, and she passed her hand over her face.Both face and hands were very white."
"“那么，你是打算不跟我们说一声再见就离开？”","‘You meant, then, to go away without saying good-bye to us?’"
"“是的。”因萨罗夫用确定而厚重的声音回答道。","‘Yes,’ replied Insarov in a surly, thick voice."
"“什么？在我们认识、聊天，在所有的一切发生之后……如果不是我在这里偶然碰到你，”（埃琳娜的声音开始颤抖，她停了一小会儿，）“你就打算这样离开，甚至不最后一次握握手，你就真的一点儿都不在乎？”","‘What?After our friendship, after the talks, after everything….Then if I had not met you here by chance.’ (Elena’s voice began to break, and she paused an instant)… ‘you would have gone away like that, without even shaking hands for the last time, and you would not have cared?’"
"因萨罗夫掉过头去：“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，请不要这样说。我本来就很难过了。相信我，我费了很大的勇气才下了这个决定。如果你知道——”","Insarov turned away.‘Elena Nikolaevnas don’t talk like that, please.I’m not over happy as it is.Believe me, my decision has cost me great effort.If you knew—’"
"“我不想知道，”埃琳娜沮丧地打断了他，“你为什么要走……看来这是很必要的。看来我们必须要分开了。你是不会毫无原因让你的朋友伤心的。但是，有朋友是这样分别的吗？我们是朋友，对吧？”","‘I don’t want to know,’ Elena interposed with dismay, ‘why you are going….It seems it’s necessary.It seems we must part.You would not wound your friends without good reason.But, can friends part like this?And we are friends, aren’t we?’"
"“不是。”因萨罗夫说。","‘No,’ said Insarov."
"“什么？”埃琳娜轻轻说道。她的脸颊上泛起了一层淡淡的红晕。","‘What?’ murmured Elena.Her cheeks were overspread with a faint flush."
"“这正是我要离开的原因——因为我们不是朋友。不要逼我说些我不愿意说，也绝不会说的话。”","‘That’s just why I am going away—because we are not friends.Don’t force me into saying what I don’t want to say, and what I won’t say.’"
"“你曾经跟我无话不谈。”埃琳娜有些怪罪地说，“你还记得吗？”","‘You used to be so open with me,’ said Elena rather reproachfully.‘Do you remember?’"
"“我过去能对你敞开心胸，因为那时我没有什么需要隐瞒的，但是，现在——”","‘I used to be able to be open, then I had nothing to conceal; but now—’"
"“但是现在？”埃琳娜问道。","‘But now?’ queried Elena."
"“但是现在……现在我必须要走了。再见。”","‘But now… now I must go away.Goodbye.’"
"如果在那一瞬间因萨罗夫抬起头看埃琳娜的话，他会发现，自己越是烦恼、痛苦，埃琳娜的脸上就越发开心，但是他一直都盯着地板。","If, at that instant, Insarov had lifted his eyes to Elena, he would have seen that her face grew brighter and brighter as he frowned and looked gloomy; but he kept his eyes obstinately fixed on the ground."
"“好吧，那再见吧，德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇。”她说道，“但是，既然我们遇见了，现在至少把你的手递给我吧。”","‘Well, good-bye, Dmitri Nikanorovitch,’ she began.‘But at least, since we have met, give me your hand now.’"
"因萨罗夫伸出手。“不，就连这我也不能做。”他说着，再次掉过头去。","Insarov was stretching out his hand.‘No, I can’t even do that,’ he said, and turned away again."
"“你做不到？”","‘You can’t?’"
"“是的，我不能。再见吧。”他走到小教堂的入口。","‘No, I can’t.Good-bye.’And he moved away to the entrance of the chapel."
"“请稍等片刻。”埃琳娜说，“你看起来很怕我。但是我比你勇敢。”她说道，全身突然轻轻颤抖了起来，“我能告诉你……我可以吗？你怎么会发现我在这里的？你知道我要去哪里吗？”","‘Wait a little longer,’ said Elena.‘You seem afraid of me.But I am braver than you,’ she added, a faint tremor passing suddenly over her whole body.‘I can tell you… shall I?…how it was you found me here?Do you know where I was going?’"
"因萨罗夫困惑地看着埃琳娜。","Insarov looked in bewilderment at Elena,"
"“我是去找你的。”","‘I was going to you.’"
"“找我？”","‘To me?’"
"埃琳娜低下头。“您这是在逼我说我爱你吗？”她小声说道，“那，我已经说了。”","Elena hid her face.‘You mean to force me to say that I love you,’ she whispered.‘There, I have said it.’"
"“埃琳娜！”因萨罗夫喊道。","‘Elena!’ cried Insarov."
"她握着他的手，看着他，投入了他的怀中。","She took his hands, looked at him, and fell on his breast."
"他紧紧地抱着她，一句话也说不出来。他不需要告诉她他也爱着她。仅仅从那一声呼喊，从他整个人突然间的改变，从她紧紧贴着的起伏的胸膛，从他深情地抚摸着她长发的指尖，埃琳娜可以感受到，他也是爱着她的。他没有说话，她不需要任何言语。“他就在这里，他爱着我……那还需要什么呢？”一种快乐的宁静充斥着她的心。那是一种暴风雨后驶入港湾、到达彼岸的宁静，一种天国般的、能让死亡都变得重大、美丽的宁静。她什么都不想要，因为她什么都有了。“啊！我的兄弟，我的朋友，我最亲爱的人！”她轻轻说道。她不知道是谁的心这么幸福地跳跃着，在她的胸前融化着，是他的还是自己的呢？","He held her close to him, and said nothing.There was no need for him to tell her he loved her.From that cry alone, from the instant transformation of the whole man, from the heaving of the breast to which she clung so confidingly, from the touch of his finger tips in her hair, Elena could feel that she was loved.He did not speak, and she needed no words.‘He is here, he loves me… what need of more?’The peace of perfect bliss, the peace of the harbour reached after storm, of the end attained, that heavenly peace which gives significance and beauty even to death, filled her with its divine flood.She desired nothing, for she had gained all.‘O my brother, my friend, my dear one!’ her lips were whispering, while she did not know whose was this heart, his or her own, which beat so blissfully, and melted against her bosom."
"他静静地站在那里，紧紧地拥抱着这个已经托付给他的年轻生命。他感受到自己怀中这个前所未有的、无比珍贵的负担。一种温柔的激情、一种无法言喻的感激之情已经彻底征服了他那颗无法撼动的心。此刻他的眼角流下了莫名的泪水。","He stood motionless, folding in his strong embrace the young life surrendered to him; he felt against his heart this new, infinitely precious burden; a passion of tenderness, of gratitude unutterable, was crumbling his hard will to dust, and tears unknown till now stood in his eyes."
"她没有流泪，她只是不停地重复：“我的朋友，我的兄弟！”","She did not weep; she could only repeat, ‘O my friend, my brother!’"
"“你会跟我一起浪迹天涯吗？”过了一会儿，他问她，依然把她紧紧地抱在自己的怀里。","’So you will follow me everywhere?’ he said to her, a quarter of an hour later, still enfolding her and keeping her close to him in his arms."
"“我会陪你到天涯海角。你在哪里，我就在哪里。”","‘Everywhere, to the ends of the earth.Where you are, I will be.’"
"“不过，你不要欺骗自己，你知道的，你的父母是不会让我们结婚的。”","‘And you are not deceiving yourself, you know your parents will never consent to our marriage?’"
"“我清楚地知道我没有欺骗自己。”","‘I don’t deceive myself; I know that.’"
"“你知道我很穷——几乎就是一个乞丐。”","‘You know that I’m poor—almost a beggar.’"
"“我知道。”","‘I know.’"
"“我不是俄国人，我不会长久地住在俄国，所以，你将不得不失去所有与你的祖国、人民的联系。”","‘That I’m not a Russian, that it won’t be my fate to live in Russia, that you will have to break all your ties with your country, with your people.’"
"“我知道，我知道。”","‘I know, I know.’"
"“你知道吗？我已经把自己奉献给了一个苦难重重、不求回报的事业，我……我们可能会面对的不仅仅是危险，还有困苦的生活，还会受人欺侮，也许——”","‘Do you know, too, that I have given myself up to a difficult, thankless cause, that I… that we shall have to expose ourselves not to dangers only, but to privation, humiliation, perhaps—’"
"“我知道，这些我都知道——我爱你——”","‘I know, I know all—I love you—’"
"“你要抛弃过去所有的生活习惯，一个人生活在陌生的人群中，可能还要被迫去做工——”","‘That you will have to give up all you are accustomed to, that out there alone among strangers, you will be forced perhaps to work—’"
"她把手放在他的嘴唇上。“我爱你，我最亲爱的。”","She laid her hand on his lips.‘I love you, my dear one.’"
"他开始激烈地亲吻她那修长、红润的手。埃琳娜没有把手从他的嘴边拿开。她带着一种天真的愉悦，微笑着，好奇地看着他先亲吻她的手掌、然后是手指……","He began hotly kissing her slender, rosy hand.Elena did not draw it away from his lips, and with a kind of childish delight, with smiling curiosity, watched how he covered with kisses, first the palm, then the fingers…."
"突然，她的脸刷地一下变得通红，她把头埋进了他的胸膛。","All at once she blushed and hid her face upon his breast."
"他温柔地抬起她的头，久久地凝视着她的眼睛。“那么好吧，欢迎你来到我的身边，我的妻子，让上帝和众人为我们见证！”","He lifted her head tenderly and looked steadily into her eyes.‘Welcome, then, my wife, before God and men!’"
"第十九章","CHAPTER XIX"
"一个小时后，埃琳娜一手拿着帽子，另一只手拿着披肩，缓步走入了别墅的客厅。她的头发稍显凌乱，两颊上还留着小小的、鲜红的吻痕，嘴角依然挂着微笑。她的眼睛几乎闭上，被眼帘遮去了一半，也带着笑意。她疲倦得几乎迈不开步子，但是这种疲倦让她很开心，事实上，所有的一切都让她很开心。在她看来，所有的一切都那么甜蜜和亲切。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇坐在窗边。她走向他，把一只手放在了他的肩膀上，微微伸展，看似不自觉地笑了起来。","An hour later, Elena, with her hat in one hand, her cape in the other, walked slowly into the drawing-room of the villa.Her hair was in slight disorder; on each cheek was to be seen a small bright spot of colour, the smile would not leave her lips, her eyes were nearly shutting and half hidden under the lids; they, too, were smiling.She could scarcely move for weariness, and this weariness was pleasant to her; everything, indeed, was pleasant to her.Everything seemed sweet and friendly to her.Uvar Ivanovitch was sitting at the window; she went up to him, laid her hand on his shoulder, stretched a little, and involuntarily, as it seemed, she laughed."
"“笑什么呢？”他有些惊讶地问道。","‘What is it?’ he inquired, astonished."
"她不知道该说什么。她有种想要亲吻尤瓦·伊万诺维奇的冲动。","She did not know what to say.She felt inclined to kiss Uvar Ivanovitch."
"终于，她解释说：“那人溅了一身的水！”","‘How he splashed!’ she explained at last."
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇却纹丝不动，仍然惊讶地看着埃琳娜。她把她的帽子和披肩放在他身上。","But Uvar Ivanovitch did not stir a muscle, and continued to look with amazement at Elena.She dropped her hat and cape on to him."
"她说：“亲爱的尤瓦·伊万诺维奇，我现在又累又困。”然后再次笑起来，蜷缩进他旁边一张低矮的椅子里。","‘Dear Uvar Ivanovitch,’ she said, ‘I am sleepy and tired,’ and again she laughed and sank into a low chair near him."
"“嗯，”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇一边晃着手指，一边嘟囔着说，“那你应该——对——”","‘H’m,’ grunted Uvar Ivanovitch, flourishing his fingers, ‘then you ought—yes—’"
"埃琳娜看了看自己的周围，想道：“这一切很快就要不属于我了……不可思议的是——我一点儿都不害怕、不迟疑、也不后悔……不，我对不起母亲。”然后，那个小教堂又浮现在她的脑海中，自己的声音再次回荡其中，她感觉被他的双臂拥抱着。她快乐地感到一丝不安，但这不安被舒适的幸福感给压了下去。那个要饭的老太太又浮现在她的脑海里。“她的确带走了我的悲伤。”她想着，“哦，我真的很快乐！这是多么不应该啊！太迅速了！”如果她稍微放纵自己的情绪的话，她将会难以遏止地流下甜蜜的泪水。她只能用欢笑来抑制这泪水。任何一种表情对她来说都是最舒适安逸的。她感觉自己就像躺在摇篮中，缓缓入睡。她的所有动作都那么轻柔和缓慢。她的狼狈，她的急躁都去了哪里？卓娅走了进来，埃琳娜觉得自己从未看到过比这更迷人的脸孔；安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜也走了进来，埃琳娜心中感到一阵剧痛，但她满怀柔情地拥抱了母亲，并且亲吻了母亲那已经有些许白发的前额！然后，她走进自己的房间。那里的一切都在向她微笑！她带着一种害羞的胜利和宁静的心情坐到了自己的床上——仅三个小时之前，她就是坐在这张床上度过了那段苦涩的时光。“尽管，在那时，我就知道他爱着我，”她思索着，“尽管之前……啊，不！这是错误的。你是我的妻子。”她嘴中轻轻地念道，用双手蒙着脸，趴在膝盖上。","Elena was looking round her and thinking, ‘From all this I soon must part… and strange—I have no dread, no doubt, no regret….No, I am sorry for mamma.’Then the little chapel rose again before her mind, again her voice was echoing in it, and she felt his arms about her.Joyously, though faintly, her heart fluttered; weighed down by the languor of happiness.The old beggar-woman recurred to her mind.’She did really bear away my sorrow,‘ she thought.’Oh, how happy I am!how undeservedly!how soon!‘If she had let herself go in the least she would have melted into sweet, endless tears.She could only restrain them by laughing.Whatever attitude she fell into seemed to her the easiest, most comfortable possible; she felt as if she were being rocked to sleep.All her movements were slow and soft; what had become of her awkwardness, her haste?Zoya came in; Elena decided that she had never seen a more charming little face; Anna Vassilyevna came in; Elena felt a pang—but with what tenderness she embraced her mother and kissed her on the forehead near the hair, already slightly grey!Then she went away to her own room; how everything smiled upon her there!With what a sense of shamefaced triumph and tranquillity she sat down on her bed—the very bed on which, only three hours ago, she had spent such bitter moments!‘And yet, even then, I knew he loved me,’ she thought, ‘even before…Ah, no!it’s a sin.You are my wife,’ she whispered, hiding her face in her hands and falling on her knees."
"傍晚时分，她陷入了更深的思索。她一想到无法立刻与因萨罗夫相见，一种悲伤的情绪便向她袭来。要是继续留在别尔谢涅夫那里，他就会引起别人的怀疑，所以他和埃琳娜商量了解决办法。因萨罗夫先回莫斯科，然后在秋天前来看她们两次；她则许诺给他写信，如果条件允许，在孔佐沃附近的某个地方安排与他见一面。她下楼到客厅喝茶，发现全家人和舒宾都在。她一出现，舒宾就直勾勾地仔细打量她。她想同过去一样亲切地跟他聊聊，但又害怕自己在他敏锐的洞察力面前露出破绽。她敢肯定，这两个星期他都没有惹过她是有原因的。不一会儿，别尔谢涅夫到了。他代表因萨罗夫问候了安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜，同时传达了因萨罗夫回莫斯科前没有来向她告别的歉意。这是那天因萨罗夫的名字第一次在埃琳娜面前提起。她觉得自己的脸红了起来。她觉得自己应当为这样一个好朋友的突然离开而表示遗憾，但又无法逼迫自己表现得那么虚伪，于是她继续老老实实、一声不吭地坐着，然而安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜倒是叹了口气，表示惋惜。埃琳娜尽量站在别尔谢涅夫的身边。她并不害怕他，虽然他甚至知道她的一些秘密。她觉得在他的身旁似乎能躲开舒宾一直注视的目光——没有任何嘲弄却充满了关怀。当晚，别尔谢涅夫的心里也感到惶惑，他原以为埃琳娜会更加难过。她很高兴别尔谢涅夫和舒宾就艺术而开始了一场辩论。她走到一旁，听到他们的声音仿佛是从梦中传来的一样。渐渐的，不光是他们，整个房间、她周围的一切都像是在梦中——所有这一切：桌上的茶壶、尤瓦·伊万诺维奇的短背心、卓娅光亮的手指甲、墙上康斯坦丁·帕夫洛维奇大公的油画肖像，全部都在慢慢淡化，仿佛笼罩上了一层薄雾，一切都在逐渐消失。只留下她为他们所感到的悲哀。“他们是为什么而活着呢？”她思索着。","Towards the evening, she grew more thoughtful.Sadness came upon her at the thought that she would not soon see Insarov.He could not without awakening suspicion remain at Bersenyev’s, and so this was what he and Elena had resolved on.Insarov was to return to Moscow and to come over to visit them twice before the autumn; on her side she promised to write him letters, and, if it were possible, to arrange a meeting with him somewhere near Kuntsov.She went down to the drawing-room to tea, and found there all the household and Shubin, who looked at her sharply directly she came in; she tried to talk to him in a friendly way as of old, but she dreaded his penetration, she was afraid of herself.She felt sure that there was good reason for his having left her alone for more than a fortnight.Soon Bersenyev arrived, and gave Insarov’s respects to Anna Vassilyevna with an apology for having gone back to Moscow without calling to take leave of her.Insarov’s name was for the first time during the day pronounced before Elena.She felt that she reddened; she realised at the same time that she ought to express regret at the sudden departure of such a pleasant acquaintance; but she could not force herself to hypocrisy, and continued to sit without stirring or speaking, while Anna Vassilyevna sighed and lamented.Elena tried to keep near Bersenyev; she was not afraid of him, though he even knew part of her secret; she was safe under his wing from Shubin, who still persisted in staring at her—not mockingly but attentively.Bersenyev, too, was thrown into perplexity during the evening: he had expected to see Elena more gloomy.Happily for her, an argument sprang up about art between him and Shubin; she moved apart and heard their voices as it were through a dream.By degrees, not only they, but the whole room, everything surrounding her, seemed like a dream—everything: the samovar on the table, and Uvar Ivanovitch’s short waistcoat, and Zoya’s polished finger-nails, and the portrait in oils of the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovitch on the wall; everything retreated, everything was wrapped in mist, everything ceased to exist.Only she felt sorry for them all.‘What are they living for?’ she thought."
"“你要睡着了么，列诺奇卡？”她母亲问道。她没有听到母亲的询问。","‘Are you sleepy, Lenotchka?’ her mother asked her.She did not hear the question."
"“你是说这是一种半实半虚的影射？”舒宾激烈的言辞突然唤回了埃琳娜的注意力。“其实，”他继续说道，“它的作用就在这里。完全明显的影射让人无法接受——这太粗鲁了——而虚幻的影射又无法提起别人的兴趣——这很愚蠢；但半实半虚的影射就能让人又生气又烦躁。例如，如果我说埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜喜欢上了我们中的一个，这属于哪一种影射呢？”","‘A half untrue insinuation, do you say?’These words, sharply uttered by Shubin, suddenly awakened Elena’s attention.‘Why,’ he continued, ‘the whole sting lies in that.A true insinuation makes one wretched—that’s unchristian—and to an untrue insinuation a man is indifferent—that’s stupid, but at a half true one he feels vexed and impatient.For instance, if I say that Elena Nikolaevna is in love with one of us, what sort of insinuation would that be, eh?’"
"“啊，保罗先生，”埃琳娜说，“我应该对您表示生气，不过我实在是做不到。我太累了。”","‘Ah, Monsieur Paul,’ said Elena, ‘I should like to show myself vexed, but really I can’t.I am so tired.’"
"“你怎么不去休息呢？”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜说道。她自己一到晚上就总觉得昏昏欲睡，因此喜欢催促别人去睡觉。“和我说晚安，上帝会保佑你睡个好觉的，安德烈·彼得罗维奇先生不会生你的气。”","‘Why don’t you go to bed?’ observed Anna Vassilyevna, who was always drowsy in the evening herself, and consequently always eager to send the others to bed.‘Say good-night to me, and go in God’s name; Andrei Petrovitch will excuse you.’"
"埃琳娜亲吻了她的母亲，向大家欠了欠身子就离开了。舒宾陪着她一直走到门口。“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”他在门口悄悄跟她说道，“虽然你伤害了保罗先生，你毫不留情地从他身上踩过，但是保罗先生依然祝福你和你那双小脚，祝福你小脚上穿的拖鞋和那双小拖鞋的鞋底。”","Elena kissed her mother, bowed to all and went away.Shubin accompanied her to the door.‘Elena Nikolaevna,’ he whispered to her in the doorway, ‘you trample on Monsieur Paul, you mercilessly walk over him, but Monsieur Paul blesses you and your little feet, and the slippers on your little feet, and the soles of your little slippers.’"
"埃琳娜耸了耸肩，不情愿地把手伸向了他——不是因萨罗夫亲吻过的那一只——然后走进了自己的房间，马上脱掉衣服，钻进被子里，进入了梦乡。她睡得很沉、很安详，就连小孩子也很少有睡得这么香甜的——只有疾病初愈的小孩才睡得这么香甜，而她的妈妈则守护在摇篮旁边，注视着她，聆听着她的呼吸。","Elena shrugged her shoulders, reluctantly held out her hand to him—not the one Insarov had kissed—and going up to her room, at once undressed, got into bed, and fell asleep.She slept a deep, unstirring sleep, as even children rarely sleep—the sleep of a child convalescent after sickness, when its mother sits near its cradle and watches it, and listens to its breathing."
"第二十章","CHAPTER XX"
"“去我屋里呆一会儿吧，”别尔谢涅夫刚向安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜道过别，舒宾就对他说道，“我有些东西想给你看看。”","‘Come to my room for a minute,’ Shubin said to Bersenyev, directly the latter had taken leave of Anna Vassilyevna: ‘I have something to show you.’"
"他随舒宾来到他的阁楼里。他惊讶地看到许多雕塑作品、小雕像、半身像被湿布包裹着摆放在房间的各个角落。","Bersenyev followed him to his attic.He was surprised to see a number of studies, statuettes, and busts, covered with damp cloths, set about in all the corners of the room."
"“哇，看来你一直在潜心工作。”他对舒宾说。","‘Well I see you have been at work in earnest,’ he observed to Shubin."
"“一个人总要有点儿事做。”舒宾回答道，“如果一件事做不成，一定要试试其他的。然而，正如一个真正的科西嘉人，相比起纯粹的艺术，我更专注于复仇。颤抖吧，彼桑齐亚！”","‘One must do something,’ he answered.‘If one thing doesn’t do, one must try another.However, like a true Corsican, I am more concerned with revenge than with pure art.Trema, Bisanzia!’"
"“我不知道你在说什么。”别尔谢涅夫说。","‘I don’t understand you,’ said Bersenyev."
"“那好，请稍等。朝这边看，我亲爱的朋友和恩人，这是我的头号仇人。”","‘Well, wait a minute.Deign to look this way, gracious friend and benefactor, my vengeance number one.’"
"舒宾揭开了一座雕像，然后别尔谢涅夫看到了一尊惟妙惟肖的因萨罗夫的半身雕像。舒宾把因萨罗夫的面部特征拿捏得细致入微，同时赋予了他很精妙的表情：诚实、慷慨、勇敢。","Shubin uncovered one figure, and Bersenyev saw a capital bust of Insarov, an excellent likeness.The features of the face had been correctly caught by Shubin to the minutest detail, and he had given him a fine expression, honest, generous, and bold."
"别尔谢涅夫看后十分欢喜。","Bersenyev went into raptures over it."
"“太精妙了！”他大声地说，“恭喜你。你一定要把它拿去参展！为什么要把这个优秀的作品称作你的仇人呢？”","‘That’s simply exquisite!’ he cried.‘I congratulate you.You must send it to the exhibition!Why do you call that magnificent work your vengeance?’"
"“那是因为，先生，我要把这个你口中的优秀的作品在埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜命名日的那天送给她。你知道这象征着什么吗？我们都没有瞎，我们都知道周围发生了什么，但是我们是绅士，我亲爱的先生，因此我们要像一个绅士那样来进行报复……但是，看这里，”舒宾接着说，同时掀起盖在另一尊雕像上的布，“根据现代美学的理念，艺术家享有一个令人羡慕的特权，那就是能够把各种丑恶当成是艺术创作的精髓并且在自己的作品中展现出来。我在创作二号作品时，就把仇人看成是一个彻底的无赖，而非绅士。”","‘Because, sir, I intended to offer this magnificent work as you call it to Elena Nikolaevna on her name day.Do you see the allegory?We are not blind, we see what goes on about us, but we are gentlemen, my dear sir, and we take our revenge like gentlemen….But here,’ added Shubin, uncovering another figure, ‘as the artist according to modern aesthetic principles enjoys the enviable privilege of embodying in himself every sort of baseness which he can turn into a gem of creative art, we in the production of this gem, number two, have taken vengeance not as gentlemen, but simply en canaille.’"
"他灵巧地拉下盖布，于是一个有着丹唐风格的、同样是因萨罗夫的小雕像呈现在别尔谢涅夫的眼前。再也无法想象有比这更精明、更刻薄的雕像了。那个年轻的保加利亚人被塑造成一只公羊的形象，后脚蹬地，准备用一对犄角进行冲撞。死板的庄严、挑衅、固执、笨拙、狭隘都呈现在那“母绵羊的配偶”的脸上，而这些表情又的确与因萨罗夫非常相像，这让别尔谢涅夫情不自禁地大笑起来。","He deftly drew off the cloth, and displayed to Bersenyev’s eyes a statuette in Dantan’s style, also of Insarov.Anything cleverer and more spiteful could not be imagined.The young Bulgarian was represented as a ram standing on his hind-legs, butting forward with his horns.Dull solemnity and aggressiveness, obstinacy, clumsiness and narrowness were simply printed on the visage of the ‘sire of the woolly flock,’ and yet the likeness to Insarov was so striking that Bersenyev could not help laughing."
"“怎么样？有趣吗？”舒宾说，“你认出这个英雄了么？你建不建议我把它也送去参展呢？这个，我亲爱的朋友，我打算把它在我的命名日送给我自己……阁下请允许我胡闹一次。”","‘Eh?is it amusing?’ said Shubin.‘Do you recognise the hero?Do you advise me to send it too to the exhibition?That, my dear fellow, I intend as a present for myself on my own name day….Your honour will permit me to play the fool.’"
"于是舒宾连跳三次，脚后跟都踢到了屁股。","And Shubin gave three little leaps, kicking himself behind with his heels."
"别尔谢涅夫从地上捡起盖布——盖到这尊小雕像上。","Bersenyev picked up the cloth off the floor—and threw it over the statuette."
"“啊，你实在是很有雅量。”舒宾说，“历史上到底有没有一个这么有雅量的人呢？嗯，随便说说，别介意！“那么，现在，”他继续说着，带着一种忧伤的胜利之情揭开了第三尊有些巨大的雕像，“你将看到的东西会向你展示出你朋友谦逊、敏感的一面。你将会发现他又一次像一个真正的艺术家一样感受到自我批评的必要性和作用。仔细看！”","‘Ah, you, magnanimous’—began Shubin.‘Who the devil was it in history was so particularly magnanimous?Well, never mind!And now,’ he continued, with melancholy triumph, uncovering a third rather large mass of clay, ‘you shall behold something which will show you the humility and discernment of your friend.You will realise that he, like a true artist again, feels the need and the use of self-castigation.Behold!’"
"盖布被掀开了，别尔涅夫看到了两个头像，它们紧紧靠着，就像长在一起一样……他没有立刻看出这尊雕塑的主人公，但靠近一看，才发现其中一个是安努什卡，另一个是舒宾本人。不过，与其把他们称之为画像，不如称之为讽刺像。安努什卡被塑造成一个健壮丰满的女孩，前额低低的，肥肿的眼皮遮住了眼睛，鼻孔傲慢地朝着天。她那厚厚的嘴唇有一种傲慢的曲线，整个面孔表达出一种肉欲、淡漠和大胆，却不失美好的品性。而舒宾则把自己塑造成了一个削瘦的浪子，两颊内陷，几缕发丝无力地垂在他的脸上，双眼空洞无神，鼻子又尖又薄，跟死人一般。","The cloth was lifted and Bersenyev saw two heads, modelled side by side and close as though growing together….He did not at once know what was the subject, but looking closer, he recognised in one of them Annushka, in the other Shubin himself.They were, however, rather caricatures than portraits.Annushka was represented as a handsome fat girl with a low forehead, eyes lost in layers of fat, and a saucily turned-up nose.Her thick lips had an insolent curve; her whole face expressed sensuality, carelessness, and boldness, not without goodnature.Himself Shubin had modelled as a lean emaciated rake, with sunken cheeks, his thin hair hanging in weak wisps about his face, a meaningless expression in his dim eyes, and his nose sharp and thin as a dead man’s."
"别尔谢涅夫厌恶地转过头去。“很不错的一对儿，不是吗，我亲爱的朋友？”舒宾说，“能有幸让你为它命名么？前两尊雕塑的名字我已经想好了。在半身像上可以刻上“决心解放祖国的英雄”。在小雕像上可以刻上“小心，吃香肠的德国佬！”至于这个雕塑么，你觉得叫“艺术家帕维尔·雅克夫利奇·舒宾的未来”如何？这个可以吗？”","Bersenyev turned away with disgust.‘A nice pair, aren’t they, my dear fellow?’ said Shubin; ‘won’t you graciously compose a suitable title?For the first two I have already thought of titles.On the bust shall be inscribed: “A hero resolving to liberate his country.”On the statuette: “Look out, sausage-eating Germans!”And for this work what do you think of “The future of the artist Pavel Yakovlitch Shubin?”Will that do?’"
"“够了。”别尔谢涅夫说道，“你到底值不值得把时间花在这——”他一时间也找不到一个恰当的词。","‘Leave off,’ replied Bersenyev.‘Was it worth while to waste your time on such a —’ He could not at once fix on a suitable word."
"“你的意思是这是恶心的东西？不，我亲爱的朋友，请原谅我，我认为拿这组作品去参展再合适不过了。”","‘Disgusting thing, you mean?No, my dear fellow, excuse me, if anything ought to go to the exhibition, it’s that group.’"
"“它让人感觉很不舒服。”别尔谢涅夫又说道，“更何况，它毫无意义可言。你肯定不会把自己的品味降低到这种层次。但不幸的是，我们的艺术家们现在经常会有这样的倾向。你这是在糟蹋你自己。”","‘It’s simply disgusting,’ repeated Bersenyev.‘And besides, it’s nonsense.You have absolutely no such degrading tendencies to which, unhappily, our artists have such a frequent bent.You have simply libelled yourself.’"
"“你是这样认为的么？”舒宾有些阴郁地说道，“我没有那些问题，但是如果它们找上我的话，这都得怪一个人。”“你知道吗？”他又说道，眉头揪成一团，一片愁云惨淡，“我最近试着喝酒了。”","‘Do you think so?’ said Shubin gloomily.‘I have none of them, and if they come upon me, the fault is all one person’s.Do you know,’ he added, tragically knitting his brows, ‘that I have been trying drinking?’"
"“胡闹！”","‘Nonsense?’"
"“这是真的，以上帝为证，”舒宾说，然后突然咧开嘴笑起来，满脸放光，“但是我不喜欢喝酒，我亲爱的朋友，它刺痛了我的嗓子，然后我的脑袋就像在敲锣打鼓一样痛了起来。伟大的卢西欣——哈尔兰皮·卢西欣——那个莫斯科乃至整个俄国出了名的酒鬼就曾告诉我说，我喝不了酒。用他的话来说，酒瓶不和我交谈。”","‘Yes, I have, by God,’ rejoined Shubin; and suddenly grinning and brightening,—‘but I didn’t like it, my dear boy, the stuff sticks in my throat, and my head afterwards is a perfect drum.The great Lushtchihin himself—Harlampy Lushtchihin—the greatest drunkard in Moscow, and a Great Russian drunkard too, declared there was nothing to be made of me.In his words, the bottle does not speak to me.’"
"别尔谢涅夫正要向那组雕像砸过去，舒宾阻止了他。","Bersenyev was just going to knock the group over but Shubin stopped him."
"“算了吧，我亲爱的朋友，别砸碎它，它能让我引以为戒，时刻提醒我。”","‘That’ll do, my dear boy, don’t smash it; it will serve as a lesson, a scare-crow.’"
"别尔谢涅夫笑了。","Bersenyev laughed."
"“要真是这样的话，我就不砸它了。”他说。然后他又补充道：“伟大而纯粹的艺术万岁！”","‘If that’s what it is, I will spare your scarecrow then,’ he said.And now, ‘Long live eternal true art!’"
"“纯粹的艺术万岁！”舒宾附和道，“就艺术而言，好的更好，糟糕的也并非一无是处！”","‘Long live true art!’ put in Shubin.‘By art the good is better and the bad is not all loss!’"

"埃琳娜睁开眼睛的第一个感觉是一种开心的错愕。“这可能么？这真的发生了吗？”她问自己，心里感受着幸福带来的眩晕。往事涌上心头……她已深陷其中。不一会儿，她的心又回归于幸福的平静。然而整个上午，埃琳娜变得有些心绪不宁，而在这天接下来的时间中她感觉倦怠、乏味。她真正清楚自己现在想要的究竟是什么，但这并没有让她好过一点儿。那永生难忘的会面让她从原来的生活轨迹中彻底地脱离了出来。她不再停留在过去的位置上，她走远了，然而周遭的一切还是以它们的既定轨道运行着，一切都还是老样子，仿佛没有丝毫的改变。过去的生活仍然以过去的方式继续着，指望着埃琳娜还能像过去一样配合、有兴趣。她试着给因萨罗夫写信，但也失败了。那些文字一到纸上要么变得毫无生气，要么变得虚情假意。她在日记的最后一行文字下画了一道粗线，以此宣告结束。那些都是过去的事情，现在她的所有思绪、她的整个灵魂都面向未来。她心情沉重。对于埃琳娜来说，现在跟毫不知情的母亲坐在一起、听她说话、回答她的问题、与她交谈都是一种邪恶的行为。她感到自己有种做错事的感觉，心里很难受，虽然并没有什么值得自责的。她心里不止一次地跳出一种无法抑制的冲动，想把这一切毫无保留地吐露出来，无论接下来将发生什么。“为什么，”她想道，“德米特里不把我从那个小教堂里带走，去他想去的任何地方呢？他不是在上帝面前宣告过我是他的妻子吗？我为什么要在这里？”她突然开始觉得愧对所有人，甚至包括尤瓦·伊万诺维奇。尤瓦的手指此时晃动得更加厉害。现在，她身边的一切都显得既不甜蜜也不友好，也不像是场梦，但却像梦魇一样挥之不去，压迫着她的心，指责她，对她表示愤慨，而且一点儿也不想去了解她……”“无论如何，你都是属于我们的。”她仿佛听到这么一句话。就连她那些可怜的宠物们，那些遭到虐待的鸟儿们和动物们——至少她是这样认为的——也用一种充满猜疑和敌意的眼光看着她。她深感良心所受到的谴责并且为那些感觉而羞愧。“这里毕竟是我的家，”她思索道，“我的家，我的祖国。”……“不，这里不再是你的祖国，也不再是你的家了。”心里有个声音不停地告诉她。恐怖的感觉淹没了她，她为自己的弱小而恼怒。考验才刚刚开始，她就已经失去了耐心……这就是她曾经的许诺吗？","Elena’s first sensation on awakening was one of happy consternation.‘Is it possible?Is it possible?’ she asked herself, and her heart grew faint with happiness.Recollections came rushing on her… she was overwhelmed by them.Then again she was enfolded by the blissful peace of triumph.But in the course of the morning, Elena gradually became possessed by a spirit of unrest, and for the remainder of the day she felt listless and weary.It was true she knew now what she wanted, but that made it no easier for her.That never-to-be forgotten meeting had cast her for ever out of the old groove; she was no longer at the same standpoint, she was far away, and yet everything went on about her in its accustomed order, everything pursued its own course as though nothing were changed; the old life moved on its old way, reckoning on Elena’s interest and co-operation as of old.She tried to begin a letter to Insarov, but that too was a failure; the words came on to paper either lifeless or false.Her diary she had put an end to by drawing a thick stroke under the last line.That was the past, and every thought, all her soul, was turned now to the future.Her heart was heavy.To sit with her mother who suspected nothing, to listen to her, answer her and talk to her, seemed to Elena something wicked; she felt the presence of a kind of falseness in her, she suffered though she had nothing to blush for; more than once an almost irresistible desire sprang up in her heart to tell everything without reserve, whatever might come of it afterwards.‘Why,’ she thought, ’did not Dmitri take me away then, from that little chapel, wherever he wanted to go?Didn’t he tell me I was his wife before God?What am I here for?‘She suddenly began to feel shy of every one, even of Uvar Ivanovitch, who was flourishing his fingers in more perplexity than ever.Now everything about her seemed neither sweet nor friendly, nor even a dream, but, like a nightmare, lay, an immovable dead load, on her heart; seeming to reproach her and be indignant with her, and not to care to know about her….’‘You are ours in spite of everything,’ she seemed to hear.Even her poor pets, her ill-used birds and animals looked at her—so at least she fancied—with suspicion and hostility.She felt conscience-stricken and ashamed of her feelings.‘This is my home after all,’ she thought, ‘my family, my country.’… ‘No, it’s no longer your country, nor your family,’ another voice affirmed within her.Terror was overmastering her, and she was vexed with her own feebleness.The trial was only beginning and she was losing patience already…Was this what she had promised?"
"她没有立刻控制住自己。不过，一个星期又一个星期过去了……埃琳娜的心里才稍稍平静，开始适应新的处境。她给因萨罗夫写了两封短信，而且亲自到邮局去发信。她无论如何也无法——因为羞愧和自尊——信任佣人来帮她做这件事。她已经开始期待他能出现在自己的面前……但是，在一个风和日丽的早晨，因萨罗夫没有来，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇却到了。","She did not soon gain control of herself.But a week passed and then another….Elena became a little calmer, and grew used to her new position.She wrote two little notes to Insarov, and carried them herself to the post: she could not for anything—through shame and through pride—have brought herself to confide in a maid.She was already beginning to expect him in person….But instead of Insarov, one fine morning Nikolai Artemyevitch made his appearance."
"第二十二章","CHAPTER XXII"
"在退役禁卫军中尉斯塔霍夫家中，还没有人见过他像这一天这样生这么大的气，并且摆出这样一种盛气凌人的架势。他穿着大衣，戴着帽子，悠闲地大步走进客厅，鞋跟踏得地面咚咚响。他走到镜子前，打量了自己很长时间，泰然自若地晃了晃脑袋，咬了咬嘴唇。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜怀着显而易见的激动和暗地里的喜悦看着他（事实上，她每次见到他是都是这幅情形）。他连帽子都没有脱掉，也没有向她打一声招呼，只是静静地把他那带着鹿皮手套的手伸向埃琳娜，让她亲吻。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜开始询问他治疗的状况，他没有理睬她。尤瓦·伊万诺维奇出现了。斯塔霍夫瞥了一眼他，嘴里轻哼了一声。他对待尤瓦·伊万诺维奇的态度一向冷酷、傲慢，尽管他承认尤瓦具有“真正的斯塔霍夫血统”。众所周知，几乎所有的俄国贵族世家都坚信，只有他们才具有那种独有的血统特征。我们不止一次地听到他们在所谓的“自己人中”讨论诸如波德萨拉斯金斯基家的“鼻子”、佩里普列耶夫斯基家的“脖子”之类的事情。卓娅走了过来，正对着尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇坐了下来。他嘴里咕哝了一声，躺在了一张扶椅上，要了一杯咖啡，然后只是脱掉了帽子。咖啡来了，他喝了一杯，然后依次打量了每个人，呲牙咧嘴地说：“请你们都先离开吧，”然后把头转向他的妻子，补充道，“夫人，您呆在这里。”","No one in the house of the retired lieutenant of guards, Stahov, had ever seen him so sour, and at the same time so self-confident and important as on that day.He walked into the drawing-room in his overcoat and hat, with long deliberate stride, stamping with his heels; he approached the looking-glass and took a long look at himself, shaking his head and biting his lips with imperturbable severity.Anna Vassilyevna met him with obvious agitation and secret delight (she never met him otherwise); he did not even take off his hat, nor greet her, and in silence gave Elena his doe-skin glove to kiss.Anna Vassilyevna began questioning him about the progress of his cure; he made her no reply.Uvar Ivanovitch made his appearance; he glanced at him and said, ‘bah!’He usually behaved coldly and haughtily to Uvar Ivanovitch, though he acknowledged in him ‘traces of the true Stahov blood.’Almost all Russian families of the nobility are convinced, as is well known, of the existence of exceptional hereditary characteristics, peculiar to them alone; we have more than once heard discussions ‘among ourselves’ of the Podsalaskinsky ‘noses,’ and the ‘Perepreyevsky’ necks.Zoya came in and sat down facing Nikolai Artemyevitch.He grunted, sank into an armchair, asked for coffee, and only then took off his hat.Coffee was brought him; he drank a cup, and looking at everybody in turn, he growled between his teeth, ’Sortes, s‘il vous plait,’ and turning to his wife he added, ‘et vous, madame, restez, je vous prie.’"
"她们都走出了客厅，只有安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜留在了那里。她的头激动地颤抖了起来。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇严肃的神情让她有些意外。她在想是不是发生了什么大事。","They all left the room, except Anna Vassilyevna.Her head was trembling with agitation.The solemnity of Nikolai Artemyevitch’s preparations impressed her.She was expecting something extraordinary."
"“到底怎么了？”门一关上，她就高声喊道。","‘What is it?’ she cried, directly the door was closed."
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇冷漠地瞟了一眼安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜。","Nikolai Artemyevitch flung an indifferent glance at Anna Vassilyevna."
"“也没什么大不了的事情。你老是一副立马认定自己是受害者的样子！”他开始说道，每说一个字，就会毫无必要地瘪一下嘴，“我只是想要提前告诉你，今天会有一位新朋友到我们家来用餐。”","‘Nothing special; what a way you have of assuming the air of a victim at once!’ he began, quite needlessly dropping the corners of his mouth at every word.‘I only want to forewarn you that we shall have a new guest dining here to-day.’"
"“是谁？”","‘Who is it?’"
"“库尔纳托夫斯基，叶戈尔·安德烈耶维奇。你不认识他。他是枢密院的高级秘书。”","‘Kurnatovsky, Yegor Andreyevitch.You don’t know him.The head secretary in the senate.’"
"“他今天就要来我们家用餐？”","‘He is to dine with us to-day?’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“你让大家都走开就只是想跟我说这个？”","‘And was it only to tell me this that you made every one go away?’"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇又瞟了一眼安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜——目光中带着一丝嘲弄。","Nikolai Artemyevitch again flung a glance—this time one of irony—at Anna Vassilyevna."
"“这就让你吃惊了？你过一会儿再吃惊吧。”","‘Does that surprise you?Defer your surprise a little.’"
"他闭上了嘴巴。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜也安静了一会儿。","He ceased speaking.Anna Vassilyevna too was silent for a little time."
"“我本来以为……”她开口道。","‘I could have wished—’ she was beginning."
"“我知道你一直把我看成一个‘道德败坏’的人。”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇突然说道。","‘I know you have always looked on me as an “immoral” man,’ began Nikolai Artemyevitch suddenly."
"“我！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜带着震惊嘀咕了一句。","‘I!’ muttered Anna Vassilyevna, astounded."
"“可能你是对的。我并不想否认在某些时候确实做了一些让你生气的事（‘我的那些灰马！’安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜突然想起了这件事），但是你自己也得承认，你也清楚，你的身体状况——”","‘And very likely you are right.I don’t wish to deny that I have in fact sometimes given you just grounds for dissatisfaction’ (“my greys!” flashed through Anna Vassilyevna’s head), ‘though you must yourself allow, that in the condition, as you are aware, of your constitution—’"
"“可是我并没有因此而抱怨过啊，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇。”","‘And I make no complaint against you, Nikolai Artemyevitch.’"
"“可能吧。无论如何，我并不是想为自己辩驳。时间会证明我的清白。但是我认为，我有责任向你证明，我很清楚我的责任，而且我也会处理好——那些托付于我的——家庭幸福。”","‘C’est possible.In any case, I have no intention of justifying myself.Time will justify me.But I regard it as my duty to prove to you that I understand my duties, and know how to care for—for the welfare of the family entrusted—entrusted to me.’"
"“说这些是为了什么呢？”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜思索着。（她无论如何也想不到前一天晚上，在一个英国俱乐部的一间休息室的角落里展开过一场有关俄国人没有演讲才华的讨论。“我们中的哪位精于说话之道？请说出一个！”争论者中的一人大声喊道，“好吧，那就斯塔霍夫吧。”另一个人答道，指着那时正站立着、兴奋地快要叫起来的尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇。）","‘What’s the meaning of all this?’Anna Vassilyevna was thinking.(She could not guess that the preceding evening at the English club a discussion had arisen in a corner of the smoking-room as to the incapacity of Russians to make speeches.‘Which of us can speak?Mention any one!’ one of the disputants had exclaimed.‘Well, Stahov, for instance,’ had answered the other, pointing to Nikolai Artemyevitch, who stood up on the spot almost squealing with delight.)"
"“比如说，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇接着说，“我的女儿埃琳娜。你不觉得她是时候该做出人生中的一项重大抉择了么——我是说，她该结婚了。她对知识、慈善这些的追求都很好，但是这些都应该适度、适时而止。现在是时候让她从虚幻中清醒过来，从艺术家、学者和黑山人的圈子中脱离出来，回归一个正常人的生活。”","‘For instance,’ pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch, ’my daughter Elena.Don’t you consider that the time has come for her to take a decisive step along the path—to be married, I mean to say.All these intellectual and philanthropic pursuits are all very well, but only up to a certain point, up to a certain age.It’s time for her to drop her mistiness, to get out of the society of all these artists, scholars, and Montenegrins, and do like everybody else.’"
"“我该如何理解你所说的这些呢？”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜问道。","‘How am I to understand you?’ asked Anna Vassilyevna."
"“好吧，只要你好好听我说，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇说，还是不时地瘪瘪嘴角，“我就不绕圈子、坦白跟你讲。我认识并且熟识了这个叫做库尔纳托夫斯基先生的年轻人，我想让他成为我的女婿。我敢肯定，你见到他后绝不会认为我偏心或者决定下得太过仓促。”（尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇说着，并为自己的口才而洋洋自得。）“他受过良好的教育，曾就读于最高等的法学院，知书达礼，今年33岁，是高级秘书和议员，还获得过一枚斯坦尼斯拉斯勋章。你也知道，我不是那种为了所谓的地位而钻营的贵族，然而你也告诉过我，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜喜欢那种务实的商人。首先，叶戈尔·安德烈耶维奇就是一个商人，另外，我们的女儿特别欣赏慷慨大方的人，那么让我告诉你吧，叶戈尔·安德烈耶维奇一有能力——你明白我的意思——赚钱养活自己之后，就为了兄弟的利益而拒绝了父亲每年对他物质上的援助。”","‘Well, if you will kindly listen,’ answered Nikolai Artemyevitch, still with the same dropping of the corners of his lips, ‘I will tell you plainly, without beating about the bush.I have made acquaintance, I have become intimate with this young man, Mr. Kurnatovsky, in the hope of having him for a son-in-law.I venture to think that when you see him, you will not accuse me of partiality or precipitate judgment.’ (Nikolai Artemyevitch was admiring his own eloquence as he talked.)‘Of excellent education—educated in the highest legal college—excellent manners, thirty-three years old, and upper-secretary, a councillor, and a Stanislas cross on his neck.You, I hope, will do me the justice to allow that I do not belong to the number of those peres de famille who are mad for position; but you yourself told me that Elena Nikolaevna likes practical business men; Yegor Andreyevitch is in the first place a business man; now on the other side, my daughter has a weakness for generous actions; so let me tell you that Yegor Andreyevitch, directly he had attained the possibility—you understand me—the possibility of living without privation on his salary, at once gave up the yearly income assigned him by his father, for the benefit of his brothers.’"
"“他的父亲是？”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜问道。","‘Who is his father?’ inquired Anna Vassilyevna."
"“他的父亲？他的父亲在他的家族中也是个了不起的人物，声望很高，性格坚韧不拔，据我所知好像是个退役的少校，打理着布——伯爵的全部产业。”","‘His father?His father is a man well-known in his own line, of the highest moral character, un vrai stoicien, a retired major, I think, overseer of all the estates of the Count B—’"
"“啊！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜喊了出来。","‘Ah!’ observed Anna Vassilyevna."
"“啊！啊什么？”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇说，“你有什么意见吗？”","‘Ah!why ah?’ interposed Nikolai Artemyevitch.‘Can you be infected with prejudice?’"
"“没有啊，我什么也没说……”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜说。","‘Why, I said nothing—’ Anna Vassilyevna was beginning."
"“不，你说了声，啊！无论如何我都觉得应该让你知道我的想法，而且我认为、希望库尔纳托夫斯基先生能受到热情的款待。他可不是什么黑山的无赖。”","‘No, you said, ah!—However that may be, I have thought it well to acquaint you with my way of thinking; and I venture to think—I venture to hope Mr. Kurnatovsky will be received a bras ouverts.He is no Montenegrin vagrant.’"
"“当然。我只需要把厨师万卡叫来，叫他多做些菜就行了。”","‘Of course; I need only call Vanka the cook and order a few extra dishes.’"
"“你知道我顾不上这些。”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇说道。他站起身来，戴上了帽子，吹着口哨（他曾听别人说过，只有在乡间别墅和马场吹口哨才是得体的行为）去花园里散步了。舒宾从自己房间的小窗户看着他走了出去，暗自朝他吐了吐舌头。","‘You are aware that I will not enter into that,’ said Nikolai Artemyevitch; and he got up, put on his hat, and whistling (he had heard some one say that whistling was only permissible in a country villa and a riding court) went out for a stroll in the garden.Shubin watched him out of the little window of his lodge, and in silence put out his tongue at him."
"差十分四点的时候，一架出租马车停在了斯塔霍夫家别墅的台阶前，一个外表俊朗、穿着简单而优雅的年轻人走下了马车，报了自己的姓名。这就是叶戈尔·安德烈耶维奇·库尔纳托夫斯基。","At ten minutes to four, a hackney-carriage drove up to the steps of the Stahovs’s villa, and a man, still young, of prepossessing appearance, simply and elegantly dressed, stepped out of it and sent up his name.This was Yegor Andreyevitch Kurnatovsky."
"于是，除去其他事情，埃琳娜在次日给因萨罗夫的信中还写道：","This was what, among other things, Elena wrote next day to Insarov:"
"“恭喜我吧，亲爱的德米特里，我有了一个追求者。他昨天和我们一起共进晚餐。我想父亲是在英国俱乐部跟他认识的，并且邀请了他到我家来。当然，他昨天还没有表现出要追求我的意思。但是我好心的母亲知道父亲的期望，悄悄地告诉了我这个客人是谁。他叫叶戈尔·安德烈耶维奇·库尔纳托夫斯基，是枢密院的高级秘书。我先给你说说他的长相吧。他中等个头，比你矮一点儿，身材不错，五官端正，小平头，留着浓浓的络腮胡。他的眼睛不大（跟你一样），棕色，很灵活，嘴巴扁而宽。他的眼睛和嘴永远露出职业化的微笑，就像一直都在上班一样。他的动作简洁，谈吐清晰，整个人都很严谨。他走起路来、笑起来以及吃东西的时候都像在上班一样。你现在可能在想‘她打量得可真仔细啊！’是的，只有这样才能把他清楚地描述给你听啊。更何况，谁不会仔细地观察追求她的人呢！他感觉上很坚韧——同时也很呆板、无趣——很诚恳，他们说他真的非常诚恳。你也是个坚韧的人，但是跟他又不一样。吃饭的时候，他坐在我旁边，舒宾坐在我们对面。一开始，他们在谈论有关商业方面的一些事情。他们说他在商业方面特别有头脑，差点儿就放弃政府职员的工作而去管理一个大型的制造工厂。真可惜他没有这样做！然后舒宾开始谈戏剧。库尔纳托夫斯基先生就声明——我必须承认——他对艺术一窍不通，这绝不是故作谦虚。这让我想起了你，但是随后我又想道，不，德米特里和我所谓的不懂艺术又与他不同。这位先生的意思似乎是‘我对艺术一无所知，而且艺术是多余的，尽管在一个秩序井然的国度，它是受到认可的’。然而，他似乎对彼得堡相当不以为然。他还一度称自己为无产阶级。他说‘我们是劳动者。’我就想，如果是德米特里这样说的话，我会不高兴的，但是他嘛，随便他怎么吹嘘自己好了。他待我时很有礼节，但我一直觉得他就像是一个屈尊来跟我说话的首长。他夸奖别人的时候就会说谁谁谁是一个高尚的人——那是他的口头禅。他看起来很有自信、很努力，而且有自我牺牲精神（看吧，我是很公正的），就是说，他可以牺牲自己的一切利益，但是又很专横。如果被他所左右那可真是一种悲哀！吃饭的时候他们还谈到了行贿的问题。","‘Congratulate me, dear Dmitri, I have a suitor.He dined with us yesterday: papa made his acquaintance at the English club, I fancy, and invited him.Of course he did not come yesterday as a suitor.But good mamma, to whom papa had made known his hopes, whispered in my ear what this guest was.His name is Yegor Andreyevitch Kurnatovsky; he is upper-secretary to the Senate.I will first describe to you his appearance.He is of medium height, shorter than you, and a good figure; his features are regular, he is close-cropped, and wears large whiskers.His eyes are rather small (like yours), brown, and quick; he has a flat wide mouth; in his eyes and on his lips there is a perpetual sort of official smile; it seems to be always on duty there.He behaves very simply and speaks precisely, and everything about him is precise; he moves, laughs, and eats as though he were doing a duty.“How carefully she has studied him!” you are thinking, perhaps, at this minute.Yes; so as to be able to describe him to you.And besides, who wouldn’t study her suitor!There’s something of iron in him—and dull and empty at the same time—and honest; they say he is really very honest.You, too, are made of iron; but not like this man.At dinner he sat next me, and facing us sat Shubin.At first the conversation turned on commercial undertakings; they say he is very clever in business matters, and was almost throwing up his government post to take charge of a large manufacturing business.Pity he didn’t do it!Then Shubin began to talk about the theatre; Mr. Kurnatovsky declared and—I must confess—without false modesty, that he has no ideas about art.That reminded me of you—but I thought; no, Dmitri and I are ignorant of art in a very different way though.This man seemed to mean, “I know nothing of it, and it’s quite superfluous, still it may be admitted in a well-ordered state.”He seems, however, to think very little about Petersburg and comme il faut: he once even called himself one of the proletariat.‘We are working people,’ he said; I thought if Dmitri had said that, I shouldn’t have liked it; but he may talk about himself, he may boast if he likes.With me he is very attentive; but I kept feeling that a very, very condescending superior was talking with me.When he means to praise any one, he says So-and-so is a man of principle—that’s his favourite word.He seems to be self-confident, hardworking, capable of self-sacrifice (you see, I am impartial), that’s to say, of sacrificing his own interest; but he is a great despot.It would be woeful to fall into his power!At dinner they began talking about bribes."
"“他说‘我清楚，在很多情况下，收受贿赂的人是不该受到批评的，他也是无可奈何。但是，他要是被查出来了，就应该受到严惩。’”我叫道‘惩罚一个没有过错的人！’“‘是的，要坚持原则。’”‘什么原则？’舒宾问道。库尔纳托夫斯基看起来不知道是尴尬还是惊讶地说‘这不需要解释吧。’","‘“I know,” he said, “that in many cases the man who accepts a bribe is not to blame; he cannot do otherwise.Still, if he is found out, he must be punished without mercy.”’ I cried, “Punish an innocent man!”‘“Yes; for the sake of principle.” ’“What principle?” asked Shubin.Kurnatovsky seemed annoyed or surprised, and said, “That needs no explanation.”"
"“似乎一直对他很尊重的父亲也附和道‘当然不需要解释。’于是这次谈话在我的恼怒中结束了。晚上，别尔谢涅夫来了，跟他进行了一场非常激烈的辩论。我从来没有发现过我们平易近人的安德烈·彼得罗维奇这么激动过。库尔纳托夫斯基先生也没有完全否定科学、大学等等的作用，但是我充分理解安德烈·彼得罗维奇的愤怒。这个家伙竟然把这一切都看作体操一类的东西。晚饭后，舒宾走到我身边说‘这人和那人（他从不讲出你的名字）都很实际，但是看吧，差别太大了。那人在生活中追寻自己的理想；这人却几乎没有一点儿责任感，只会官场上的那一套，没有任何内涵。’舒宾很聪明，我把他的话记了下来，转达给你，但是在我心里，你们俩没有丝毫的相同之处。你有信仰，但他没有，因为一个人不能仅仅只相信自己。","‘Papa, who seems to worship him, put in “of course not”; and to my vexation the conversation stopped there.In the evening Bersenyev came and got into a terrific argument with him.I have never seen our good Andrei Petrovitch so excited.Mr. Kurnatovsky did not at all deny the utility of science, universities, and so on, but still I understood Andrei Petrovitch’s indignation.The man looks at it all as a sort of gymnastics.Shubin came up to me after dinner, and said, “This fellow here and some one else (he can never bring himself to utter your name) are both practical men, but see what a difference; there’s the real living ideal given to life; and here there’s not even a feeling of duty, simply official honesty and activity without anything inside it.”Shubin is clever, and I remembered his words to tell you; but to my mind there is nothing in common between you.You have faith, and he has not; for a man cannot have faith in himself only."
"他离开时已经很晚了，但母亲还是花时间告诉我说他对我的感觉很好，父亲也非常高兴。我在想，他有没有说我是一个高尚的女人呢？我差一点儿就告诉母亲，很抱歉，我已经是一个有丈夫的人了。为什么父亲这么不喜欢你呢？母亲嘛，我们还可以很快地改变她的观点。","‘He did not go away till late; but mamma had time to inform me that he was pleased with me, and papa is in ecstasies.Did he say, I wonder, that I was a woman of principle?I was almost telling mamma that I was very sorry, but I had a husband already.Why is it papa dislikes you so?Mamma, we could soon manage to bring round."
"哦，亲爱的！我如此细致地向你描述这位先生只是为了减轻我的心痛。离开你，我无法生存。我感觉你一直在我的眼前，对我说话。我期待与你相见——只是不要像你所打算的在我们的家中——试想一下我们会有多么地尴尬和不安！你知道我是在哪儿给你写的信吗——在那片小树林里。哦，亲爱的！我是多么爱你！”","‘Oh, my dear one!I have described this gentleman in such detail to deaden my heartache.I don’t live without you; I am constantly seeing you, hearing you.I look forward to seeing you—only not at our house, as you intended—fancy how wretched and ill at ease we should be!—but you know where I wrote to you—in that wood.Oh, my dear one!How I love you!’"
"第二十三章","CHAPTER XXIII"
"库尔纳托夫斯基初次到访后的第三个星期，让埃琳娜十分高兴的是，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜回到了莫斯科，住进了她那间离普列奇斯坚卡不远的大木屋中。那是一个有着廊柱的房子，所有的窗户上都点缀着白色的七弦琴和花环。房子里有一间阁楼、几间办公室，有一排木栅栏，还有一个巨大的绿草如茵的庭院。庭院中有一口井，井旁边有一个狗舍。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜从没有这么早从乡间别墅搬出来过，但是今年，随着秋天第一场寒潮的降临，她的脸肿了起来。而对于尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇来说，随着他疗程的结束，他也开始思念他的妻子。再者，奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂亚诺夫娜又去了雷瓦尔看望她的表妹。另外，一个名叫“活体雕像”的国外家庭杂技团来到了莫斯科，《莫斯科公报》对他们精彩表演的描述激起了安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜浓烈的兴趣。简而言之，继续在乡间别墅住下去似乎不方便了，而且用尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的话说，甚至将会影响到他完成那个“倍受珍视的计划”了。最后的那两个星期对埃琳娜来说似乎相当漫长。库尔纳托夫斯基在周日来过两次。别的时间他都在忙。他实际上是为了见埃琳娜而来，但却跟卓娅相谈甚欢。卓雅十分欣赏他。“这是个真正的男人！”她一边看着他那充满男人味的脸庞，听着他那自信而又谦逊的言辞，一边默默思考着。在她看来，没有一个人有如此充满磁性的嗓音，没有一个人能把“我有此荣幸——”或者“我很开心——”说得这么动听。因萨罗夫没有来过斯塔霍夫的家中，但是埃琳娜悄悄地在莫斯科湖边的一片小树林中和他见了一面。那个地点是埃琳娜选的。他们相互之间只是短短地说了几句话。舒宾和安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜一起回的莫斯科，而别尔谢涅夫则晚了几天才回去。","Three weeks after Kurnatovsky’s first visit, Anna Vassilyevna, to Elena’s great delight, returned to Moscow, to her large wooden house near Prechistenka; a house with columns, white lyres and wreaths over every window, with an attic, offices, a palisade, a huge green court, a well in the court and a dog’s kennel near the well.Anna Vassilyevna had never left her country villa so early, but this year with the first autumn chills her face swelled; Nikolai Artemyevitch for his part, having finished his cure, began to want his wife; besides, Augustina Christianovna had gone away on a visit to her cousin in Revel; a family of foreigners, known as ‘living statues,’ des poses plastiques, had come to Moscow, and the description of them in the Moscow Gazette had aroused Anna Vassilyevna’s liveliest curiosity.In short, to stay longer at the villa seemed inconvenient, and even, in Nikolai Artemyevitch’s words, incompatible with the fulfilment of his ‘cherished projects.’The last fortnight seemed very long to Elena.Kurnatovsky came over twice on Sundays; on other days he was busy.He came really to see Elena, but talked more to Zoya, who was much pleased with him.‘Das ist ein Mann!’ she thought to herself, as she looked at his full manly face and listened to his self-confident, condescending talk.To her mind, no one had such a wonderful voice, no one could pronounce so nicely, ‘I had the hon-our,’ or, ‘I am most de-lighted.’Insarov did not come to the Stahovs, but Elena saw him once in secret in a little copse by the Moskva river, where she arranged to meet him.They hardly had time to say more than a few words to each other.Shubin returned to Moscow with Anna Vassilyevna; Bersenyev, a few days later."
"因萨罗夫坐在自己的房间里，第三遍看着那些让人从保加利亚带过来的信件。他们不敢让邮局投递这些信件。他被这些信搅得一团糟。东欧各国的局势发展得很迅猛。俄国军队对各公国的侵略让每个人的心都提到了嗓子眼。风暴正在酝酿之中——已经能嗅到一场不可避免的战争即将到来的气息。到处燃起战争的火焰，没有人能够预见它将烧到何方——会在哪里熄灭。过去的纷争，长久以来的美好希望——所有这一切再次蠢蠢欲动了起来。因萨罗夫的心也在狂野地跳动着。他的希望也快要实现了。“可是，这一切是不是来得太快了，不会功亏一篑吧？”他紧紧握住双手，思索着，“我们还没有准备好，但是就这样吧！我必须走！”","Insarov was sitting in his room, and for the third time looking through the letters brought him from Bulgaria by hand; they were afraid to send them by post.He was much disturbed by them.Events were developing rapidly in the East; the occupation of the Principalities by Russian troops had thrown all men’s minds into a ferment; the storm was growing—already could be felt the breath of approaching inevitable war.The fire was kindling all round, and no one could foresee how far it would go—where it would stop.Old wrongs, long cherished hopes—all were astir again.Insarov’s heart throbbed eagerly; his hopes too were being realised.‘But is it not too soon, will it not be in vain?’ he thought, tightly clasping his hands.‘We are not ready, but so be it!I must go.’"
"门外沙沙作响，门飞快地开了，埃琳娜跑进屋里来。","Something rustled lightly at the door, it flew quickly open, and into the room ran Elena."
"因萨罗夫浑身颤抖着奔向她，跪在她的面前，紧紧抱住她的腰，把头用力地靠在上面。","Insarov, all in a tremor, rushed to her, fell on his knees before her, clasped her waist and pressed it close against his head."
"“没有想到我会过来吧？”她上气不接下气地说。她是飞快地跑着上楼梯的。“亲爱的！亲爱的！这就是你住的地方？我轻轻松松就找到你了。你房东的女儿带我来的。我们前天就到了。我本来想给你写信的，但还是觉得自己过来更好。我可以在你这里呆十五分钟。起来，把门关上。”","‘You didn’t expect me?’ she said, hardly able to draw her breath, she had run quickly up the stairs.‘Dear one!dear one!—so this is where you live?I’ve quickly found you.The daughter of your landlord conducted me.We arrived the day before yesterday.I meant to write to you, but I thought I had better come myself.I have come for a quarter of an hour.Get up, shut the door.’"
"他站起身来，赶紧关上门，跑回她身旁，握紧她的双手。他一句话也说不出来，兴奋到无法呼吸。她双眼带笑地看向他的眼睛……他的眼里充满了狂喜……她感到有点儿难为情。","He got up, quickly shut the door, returned to her and took her by the hands.He could not speak; he was choking with delight.She looked with a smile into his eyes… there was such rapture in them… she felt shy."
"“等等，”她说着，温柔地把手从他的手中抽出来，“让我先把帽子脱了。”","‘Stay,’ she said, fondly taking her hand away from him, ‘let me take off my hat.’"
"她解下帽子，丢到一旁，从肩膀上拿下披肩，理了理头发，然后坐到了一张破旧的小沙发上。因萨罗夫注视着她，眼睛一眨不眨，像着了魔一样。","She untied the strings of her hat, flung it down, slipped the cape off her shoulders, tidied her hair, and sat down on the little old sofa.Insarov gazed at her, without stirring, like one enchanted."
"“坐下吧。”她说道，没有抬头看他，用手指了指旁边的位置。","‘Sit down,’ she said, not lifting her eyes to him and motioning him to a place beside her."
"因萨罗夫坐下了，不过没有坐在沙发上，而是坐在了她脚旁边的地板上。","Insarov sat down, not on the sofa, but on the floor at her feet."
"“来吧，帮我把手套脱了。”她含糊地说道。她觉得有点儿害怕。","‘Come, take off my gloves,’ she said in an uncertain voice.She felt afraid."
"他先解开扣子，然后慢慢拽下一只手套，跩到一半，便急切地将自己的双唇印在了那被手套遮住的、纤细、柔软、白皙的手腕上。","He began first to unbutton and then to draw off one glove; he drew it half off and greedily pressed his lips to the slender, soft wrist, which was white under it."
"埃琳娜全身一震，想用另一只手把他推开，但他又开始亲吻她的另一只手。埃琳娜把手缩回来，他抬起头，她看着他的脸，俯下身去，他们的双唇碰到了一起。","Elena shuddered, and would have pushed him back with the other hand; he began kissing the other hand too.Elena drew it away, he threw back his head, she looked into his face, bent above him, and their lips touched."
"过了一会儿，她挣脱开，站起身来，嘴里轻轻地说着：“不，不。”然后快步走到书桌旁边。","An instant passed… she broke away, got up, whispered ‘No, no,’ and went quickly up to the writing-table."
"“我是这里的女主人，所以你不能对我有丝毫的隐瞒。”她说。她试着让自己平静下来，背对着他。“这么多信啊！都写的是什么呢？”","‘I am mistress here, you know, so you ought not to have any secrets from me,’ she said, trying to seem at ease, and standing with her back to him.‘What a lot of papers!what are these letters?’"
"因萨罗夫皱起了眉头。“那些信？”他站起来说，“你可以看看。”","Insarov knitted his brows.‘Those letters?’ he said, getting up, ‘you can read them.’"
"埃琳娜把那些信拿起来看了看。“这么多信，字很清秀，但是我马上就要走了……不管它们啦。它们不是情敌写的吧。嗯？它们不是用俄语写的啊。”她补充道，然后把信随意翻了翻。","Elena turned them over in her hand.‘There are so many of them, and the writing is so fine, and I have to go directly… let them be. They’re not from a rival, eh?…and they’re not in Russian,’ she added, turning over the thin sheets."
"因萨罗夫走到了她的身边，深情地抚摸着她的腰。她立刻朝他转了过来，朝他笑了笑，依偎在他的肩头。","Insarov came close to her and fondly touched her waist.She turned suddenly to him, smiled brightly at him and leant against his shoulder."
"“那些信都是从保加利亚带过来的，埃琳娜。是我朋友写给我的，他们希望我过去。”","‘Those letters are from Bulgaria, Elena; my friends write to me, they want me to come.’"
"“现在？去他们那儿？”","‘Now?To them?’"
"“是的……现在，现在还有时间，也还有可能过去。”","‘Yes… now, while there is still time, while it is still possible to come.’"
"她马上就用双手环抱住他的脖子：“你会带我一起去的，对吗？”","All at once she flung both arms round his neck, ‘You will take me with you, yes?’"
"他紧紧将她拥入胸口。“哦，我的宝贝，我的女英雄，你怎么会这么说呢！但是我这样一个无家可归、无依无靠的单身汉拉着你一起走，我会不会太邪恶、太疯狂了……而且还是去那样的地方！”","He pressed her to his heart.‘O my sweet girl, O my heroine, how you said that!But isn’t it wicked, isn’t it mad for me, a homeless, solitary man, to drag you with me… and out there too!’"
"她捂住他的嘴：“嘘——再这样说我就生气了，再也不来见你了。我们之间的事不是已经定好了，一切都说好了吗？难道我不是你的妻子吗？一个妻子能离开她的丈夫吗？”","She shut his mouth…. ‘Sh—or I shall be angry, and never come to see you again.Why isn’t it all decided, all settled between us?Am I not your wife?Can a wife be parted from her husband?’"
"“妻子们不用冲锋陷阵啊。”他带着些许伤感的微笑说。","‘Wives don’t go into war,’ he said with a half-mournful smile."
"“哦，是的，她们不甘落后的时候我就可以留下来吗？”","‘Oh yes, when they can’t stay behind, and I cannot stay here?’"
"“埃琳娜，我的天使！但是你想想，也许过两个星期我就会被迫离开莫斯科。我顾不上那些大学课程，顾不上继续我的研究课题。”","‘Elena, my angel!..but think, I have, perhaps, to leave Moscow in a fortnight.I can’t think of university lectures, or finishing my work.’"
"“什么！”埃琳娜打断他，“你马上就要走？如果你愿意，我就不回家了，从这一刻起一直留在你身边好不好？我们马上就出发吗？”","‘What!’ interrupted Elena, ‘you have to go soon?If you like, I will stop at once this minute with you for ever, and not go home, shall I?Shall we go at once?’"
"因萨罗夫更加用情地将她搂在自己的双臂里。“如果我做错了，”他喊道，“就让老天来惩罚我吧！从今天起，就让我们永不分离！”","Insarov clasped her in his arms with redoubled warmth.‘May God so reward me then,’ he cried, ‘if I am doing wrong!From to-day, we are one for ever!’"
"“那我就留在这里吗？”埃琳娜问道。","‘Am I to stay?’ asked Elena."
"“不，我的好姑娘。不，我的宝贝。你今天还是要回家，只是你得做好准备，随时出发。这件事不是立刻就能完成的。我们必须慢慢地筹划。我们需要钱、护照……”","‘No, my pure girl; no, my treasure.You shall go back home to-day, only keep yourself in readiness.This is a matter we can’t manage straight off; we must plan it out well.We want money, a passport—’"
"“我有钱！”埃琳娜说道，“有80卢布。”","‘I have money,’ put in Elena.‘Eighty roubles.’"
"“好的，但那还不够，”因萨罗夫说，“但是都用得上。”","‘Well, that’s not much,’ observed Insarov; ‘but everything’s a help.’"
"“我还能拿到更多的钱。我能去借。我可以找母亲要……不，我不能找母亲要任何东西……但我能卖掉我的手表……还有我的耳环、两个手镯……还有蕾丝。”","‘But I can get more.I will borrow.I will ask mamma….No, I won’t ask mamma for any….But I can sell my watch….I have earrings, too, and two bracelets… and lace.’"
"“钱不是关键，埃琳娜，护照，你的护照，这该怎么办？”","‘Money’s not the chief difficulty, Elena; the passport; your passport, how about that?’"
"“是啊，这该怎么弄到呢？一定要护照吗？”","‘Yes, how about it?Is a passport absolutely necessary?’"
"“当然。”","‘Absolutely.’"
"埃琳娜笑了起来：“世事无常啊！我记得我小的时候……我们的一个女佣逃跑了。最后她被抓了回来，我们原谅了她，她跟我们一起生活了很长一段时间……不过，大家还是叫她‘逃跑的塔季扬娜’。我从没想过有一天我也会像她一样跑掉。”","Elena laughed.‘What a queer idea!I remember when I was little… a maid of ours ran away.She was caught, and forgiven, and lived with us a long while… but still every one used to call her Tatyana, the runaway.I never thought then that I too might perhaps be a runaway like her.’"
"“埃琳娜，难道你不觉得惭愧吗？”","‘Elena, aren’t you ashamed?’"
"“为什么？当然，有护照固然是好。但是万一我们弄不到……”","‘Why?Of course it’s better to go with a passport.But if we can’t—’"
"“我们之后再解决这些事情，之后，再等等。”因萨罗夫说，“让我再看看，让我再想想。我们再把所有的事情都想一遍。我也有钱。”","‘We will settle all that later, later, wait a little,’ said Insarov.‘Let me look about; let me think a little.We will talk over everything together thoroughly.I too have money.’"
"埃琳娜撩起他掉在前额的头发。","Elena pushed back the hair that fell over on his forehead."
"“啊，德米特里！我们俩能一起离开了，这真是太好了！”","‘O Dmitri!how glorious it will be for us two to set off together!’"
"“没错，”因萨罗夫说，“不过，我们到那里之后……”","‘Yes,’ said Insarov, ‘but there, when we get there—’"
"“嗯？”埃琳娜说，“就算我们死在一起又有什么不好呢？不，我们为什么要死呢？我们要活着，我们还年轻。你多大了？26？”","‘Well?’ put in Elena, ‘and won’t it be glorious to die together too?but no, why should we die?We will live, we are young.How old are you?Twenty-six?’"
"“是的，我26岁。”","‘Yes, twenty-six.’"
"“我20岁。我们的未来还有很长的时间。啊，你要离我而去吗？你不想和一个俄国女人相爱，你这个玻利维亚佬！现在让我看看你究竟是想怎样甩掉我吧！如果我那时不去找你，我们会变成什么样呢？”","‘And I am twenty.There is plenty of time before us.Ah, you tried to run away from me?You did not want a Russian’s love, you Bulgarian!Let me see you trying to escape from me now!What would have become of us, if I hadn’t come to you then!’"
"“埃琳娜，你知道迫使我离开的原因是什么。”","‘Elena, you know what forced me to go away.’"
"“我当然知道啊。你爱上我了，所以你害怕。但是你那时候肯定猜到了我也同样爱着你吧？”","‘I know; you were in love, and you were afraid.But surely you must have suspected that you were loved?’"
"“我发誓，埃琳娜，我没猜到。”","‘I swear on my honour, Elena, I didn’t.’"
"她出人意料地快速吻了他一下。“这个，我也因为这个而爱你。那……再见了。”","She gave him a quick unexpected kiss.‘There, I love you for that too.And goodbye.’"
"“你不能再多呆一会儿吗？”因萨罗夫问道。","‘You can’t stop longer?’ asked Insarov."
"“不行了，我最亲爱的。你觉得我一个人出来就这么容易吗？十五分钟早过了。”她披上披肩，戴上帽子。“你明天晚上来我们家吧。不，后天吧。虽然我们会觉得无趣、不自在，但我们也无能为力，至少我们能看见对方。再见了。让我走吧。”","‘No, dearest.Do you think it’s easy for me to get out alone?The quarter of an hour was over long ago.’She put on her cape and hat.‘And you come to us to-morrow evening.No, the day after to-morrow.We shall be constrained and dreary, but we can’t help that; at least we shall see each other.Good-bye.Let me go.’"
"他最后一次拥抱了她。“啊，小心点儿，你弄坏了我的表链子。哦，笨拙的孩子！算了，没关系。这样更好。我要去库兹涅茨基桥，把它送那里修一修。要是有人问我，我就说我去库兹涅茨基桥了。”她握着门把手。“顺便跟你说一句，我忘了告诉你了，库尔纳托夫斯基先生这两天会向我求婚。但是我的回答——会是这个——”说着她把左手的大拇指放在鼻尖，剩下的手指头在空中挥了挥。“那在下次见面之前，再见了。现在，我知道路了……而且不会浪费时间了。”","He embraced her for the last time.‘Ah, take care, you have broken my watch-chain.Oh, what a clumsy boy!There, never mind.It’s all the better.I will go to Kuznetsky bridge, and leave it to be mended.If I am asked, I can say I have been to Kuznetsky bridge.’She held the door-handle.‘By-the-way, I forgot to tell you, Monsieur Kurnatovsky will certainly make me an offer in a day or two.But the answer I shall make him—will be this—’ She put the thumb of her left hand to the tip of her nose and flourished the other fingers in the air.‘Good-bye till we see each other again.Now, I know the way…And don’t lose any time.’"
"埃琳娜把门打开了一个缝，听了听，转身向因萨罗夫点了点头，然后快速地溜出了房间。","Elena opened the door a little, listened, turned round to Insarov, nodded her head, and glided out of the room."
"因萨罗夫在关着的门后站了一会儿，也听着门外的声音。他听见楼下院子的门砰地响了一声。他走到沙发旁边，坐了下来，用双手捂住自己的眼睛。这种事情从未在他的身上发生过。“我怎么有资格拥有这样的爱情呢？”他思索着，“这是梦吗？”","For a minute Insarov stood before the closed door, and he too listened.The door downstairs into the court slammed.He went up to the sofa, sat down, and covered his eyes with his hands.Never before had anything like this happened to him.‘What have I done to deserve such love?’ he thought.‘Is it a dream?’"
"但是，留在这破旧昏暗的小屋子里的木犀香水味证明她确实来过。与这香气一起的还有空气中回响着的清脆的嗓音，灵巧的脚步声，还有从那天真无邪的少女身上散发出来的温暖和清新的气息。","But the delicate scent of mignonette left by Elena in his poor dark little room told of her visit.And with it, it seemed that the air was still full of the notes of a young voice, and the sound of a light young tread, and the warmth and freshness of a young girlish body."
"第二十四章","CHAPTER XXIV"
"因萨罗夫决定等待更确切的消息，同时开始着手为离开做准备。困难很大。对他自己来说倒没有什么阻碍。他只需要申请一张护照——但是埃琳娜该怎么办呢？以正当的方式来取得她的护照是不可能实现的。他是不是应该先秘密地跟她结婚，然后去拜见她的父母呢？“那样的话，他们应该会同意我们一起离开，”他思索着，“但是万一他们不同意呢？我们还是要走。但是，如果他们要起诉我……如果……不，无论如何，最好还是帮她弄到一张护照。”","Insarov decided to await more positive news, and began to make preparations for departure.The difficulty was a serious one.For him personally there were no obstacles.He had only to ask for a passport—but how would it be with Elena?To get her a passport in the legal way was impossible.Should he marry her secretly, and should they then go and present themselves to the parents?…‘They would let us go then,’ he thought ‘But if they did not?We would go all the same.But suppose they were to make a complaint… if…No, better try to get a passport somehow.’"
"他决定去请教一个熟人（当然不能透露姓名）。那是一个退休了的又或许是被撤了职的律师，他在办理各种违法事件上的经验非常丰富。这个家伙住在很远的地方。因萨罗夫乘坐着肮脏的无顶四轮马车，颠簸了整整一个小时才到他家，但更糟糕的是，他不在家，而因萨罗夫在回去的路上又遇上一场突如其来的倾盆大雨，被淋成了落汤鸡。第二天一早，因萨罗夫强忍着头痛，第二次去拜访那个退休的律师。退休的律师一边聚精会神地听着因萨罗夫的话，一边从画有一位丰满乳房的美女的鼻烟盒中抽着鼻烟，并且用他那双狡猾的、跟鼻烟壶一样颜色的小眼睛暗自打量着他的客人。他听完了因萨罗夫的话，让因萨罗夫把“所说的实际情况说得更清楚一点儿”。不过他看出因萨罗夫不愿透露详情（事实上因萨罗夫来见他也是很不情愿的），他便只让因萨罗夫准备好最关键的“必需品”，然后再过来。“当你，”他一边从开着的鼻烟盒里吸着鼻烟一边说，“更有自信、不再羞怯的时候再来。”（他用很重的口音说。）“护照嘛，”他仿佛自言自语地说道，“是可以安排好的。比如说，您在外出游时，没有人能分清您到底是玛丽亚·布雷迪欣还是卡罗利娜·沃格尔迈尔？”因萨罗夫突然感到很不舒服，但他还是万分感谢了律师，说自己一两天后就会过来。","He decided to consult (of course mentioning no names) one of his acquaintances, an attorney, retired from practice, or perhaps struck off the rolls, an old and experienced hand at all sorts of clandestine business.This worthy person did not live near; Insarov was a whole hour in getting to him in a very sorry droshky, and, to make matters worse, he did not find him at home; and on his way back got soaked to the skin by a sudden downpour of rain.The next morning, in spite of a rather severe headache, Insarov set off a second time to call on the retired attorney.The retired attorney listened to him attentively, taking snuff from a snuff-box decorated with a picture of a full-bosomed nymph, and glancing stealthily at his visitor with his sly, and also snuff-coloured little eyes; he heard him to the end, and then demanded ‘greater definiteness in the statement of the facts of the case’; and observing that Insarov was unwilling to launch into particulars (it was against the grain that he had come to him at all) he confined himself to the advice to provide himself above all things with ‘the needful,’ and asked him to come to him again, ‘when you have,’ he added, sniffing at the snuff in the open snuff-box, ‘augmented your confidence and decreased your diffidence’ (he talked with a broad accent).‘A passport,’ he added, as though to himself, ‘is a thing that can be arranged; you go a journey, for instance; who’s to tell whether you’re Marya Bredihin or Karolina Vogel-meier?’A feeling of nausea came over Insarov, but he thanked the attorney, and promised to come to him again in a day or two."
"当晚，他去了斯塔霍夫家。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜热情地招待了他，还略带怪罪地说他不应该把他们忘光了。她看见他脸色苍白，还特意询问了他的身体状况。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇一句话也没有对他说，只是带着一种复杂的、无所谓的好奇之情打量着他。舒宾对他十分冷淡，但是埃琳娜却让他吃惊不已。她一直都在等他。她特意为他穿了那件他们第一次在小教堂见面时穿的衣服。她很平静地欢迎了他，很有礼貌，笑得很自然，任何人都看不出这个女孩的命运已经注定，看不出让她光彩照人、举止灵巧动人的仅仅是心底暗藏的那份甜蜜的爱意。她替卓娅为客人倒茶，开着玩笑，闲聊着。她知道舒宾会观察她，而因萨罗夫不会掩饰自己，无法表现得漠不关心，所以她提前做好了准备。她是对的。舒宾的视线从没有离开过她，而因萨罗夫整个晚上都显得沉默、郁郁寡欢。埃琳娜却非常高兴，甚至一度想要去戏弄一下他。","The same evening he went to the Stahovs.Anna Vassilyevna met him cordially, reproached him a little for having quite forgotten them, and, finding him pale, inquired especially after his health.Nikolai Artemyevitch did not say a single word to him; he only stared at him with elaborately careless curiosity; Shubin treated him coldly; but Elena astounded him.She was expecting him; she had put on for him the very dress she wore on the day of their first interview in the chapel; but she welcomed him so calmly, and was so polite and carelessly gay, that no one looking at her could have believed that this girl’s fate was already decided, and that it was only the secret consciousness of happy love that gave fire to her features, lightness and charm to all her gestures.She poured out tea in Zoya’s place, jested, chattered; she knew Shubin would be watching her, that Insarov was incapable of wearing a mask, and incapable of appearing indifferent, and she had prepared herself beforehand.She was not mistaken; Shubin never took his eyes off her, and Insarov was very silent and gloomy the whole evening.Elena was so happy that she even felt an inclination to tease him."
"“哦，顺便问一下，”她突然对他说道，“你的计划一切都还顺利吧？”","‘Oh, by the way,’ she said to him suddenly, ‘is your plan getting on at all?’"
"因萨罗夫一惊。","Insarov was taken aback."
"“什么计划？”他问道。","‘What plan?’ he said."
"“怎么，你忘了吗？”她朝他笑着，只有他才能明白这种幸福的笑，“你给俄国读者编的保加利亚文选啊？”","‘Why, have you forgotten?’ she rejoined, laughing in his face; he alone could tell the meaning of that happy laugh: ‘Your Bulgarian selections for Russian readers?’"
"“荒唐！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇低声嘀咕着。","‘Quelle bourde!’ muttered Nikolai Artemyevitch between his teeth."
"卓娅在钢琴前坐下。埃琳娜轻微地耸了耸肩，向因萨罗夫使了个眼色，暗示他向门口看去。然后她慢慢地用手指头敲了两下桌子，看了看他。他知道她的意思是跟他约定在两天后见面。她看到他清楚了自己的想法，就朝他笑了笑。因萨罗夫起身准备告辞，他感觉很不舒服。库尔纳托夫斯基到了。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇跳了起来，将右手高高抬起过头，然后缓缓放下，握住高级秘书先生的手掌。因萨罗夫本可以再多留一会儿看看他的情敌。埃琳娜轻轻摇了摇头，主人也觉得没有介绍他们两人认识的必要，于是因萨罗夫就离开了，在走之前跟埃琳娜最后一次交换了眼神。舒宾想了又想，干脆以一个自己不懂的法律问题与库尔纳托夫斯基展开了激烈的辩论。","Zoya sat down to the piano.Elena gave a just perceptible shrug of the shoulders, and with her eyes motioned Insarov to the door.Then she twice slowly touched the table with her finger, and looked at him.He understood that she was promising to see him in two days, and she gave him a quick smile when she saw he understood her.Insarov got up and began to take leave; he felt unwell.Kurnatovsky arrived.Nikolai Artemyevitch jumped up, raised his right hand higher than his head, and softly dropped it into the palm of the chief secretary.Insarov would have remained a few minutes longer, to have a look at his rival.Elena shook her head unseen; the host did not think it necessary to introduce them to one another, and Insarov departed, exchanging one last look with Elena.Shubin pondered and pondered, and threw himself into a fierce argument with Kurnatovsky on a legislative question, about which he had not a single idea."
"因萨罗夫辗转难眠了一整夜，到了早上，他觉得很难受，但他还是开始整理文件和写信，可他觉得头昏昏沉沉的。到了晚餐时间，他开始发烧，什么也吃不下去。晚上，他的体温急剧升高，四肢酸痛，头也痛得厉害。因萨罗夫躺在那张埃琳娜不久前刚坐过的小沙发上，思索着：“这真是自作自受，我怎么会去找那个老无赖啊。”他试着让自己睡着……但是病痛此时已经完全地缠上了他。他的脉搏剧烈地跳动着，血液像在燃烧一样，思绪像鸟一样飞来飞去。他已经不省人事了。他像是被人在脸上打了一拳一样躺在那里。突然他似乎听到有人在耳边轻声笑着、窃窃私语，他挣扎着睁开双眼，燃烧的蜡烛发出的光芒像利刃一样刺进了他的眼睛……这是怎么了？老律师站在他的面前，披着一件东方式的丝质长袍，腰带上还别了一块丝绸手帕，就像昨晚看到的那样……“卡罗利娜·沃格尔迈尔。”他那掉光了牙的嘴喃喃地说。因萨罗夫看着他，那个老人变得很宽、很厚、很高，他不再是一个人了，他变成了一棵树……因萨罗夫只能抓着扭曲的树枝往上爬。他紧抱着树枝，却掉了下来，胸口撞在一块尖石头上。卡罗利娜·沃格尔迈尔正蹲在那里，像个女商贩一样，用模糊的声音叫卖着：“馅饼，馅饼，卖馅饼啦。”一旁不断有血液喷涌而出，刀锋也闪耀着寒光……埃琳娜！一切消失于血红色的混沌之中。","Insarov did not sleep all night, and in the morning he felt very ill; he set to work, however, putting his papers into order and writing letters, but his head was heavy and confused.At dinner time he began to be in a fever; he could eat nothing.The fever grew rapidly worse towards evening; he had aching pains in all his limbs, and a terrible headache.Insarov lay down on the very little sofa on which Elena had lately sat; he thought: ‘It serves me right for going to that old rascal,’ and he tried to sleep….But the illness had by now complete mastery of him.His veins were throbbing violently, his blood was on fire, his thoughts were flying round like birds.He sank into forgetfulness.He lay like a man felled by a blow on his face, and suddenly, it seemed to him, some one was softly laughing and whispering over him: he opened his eyes with an effort, the light of the flaring candle smote him like a knife….What was it?the old attorney was before him in an Oriental silk gown belted with a silk handkerchief, as he had seen him the evening before….‘Karolina Vogelmeier,’ muttered his toothless mouth.Insarov stared, and the old man grew wide and thick and tall, he was no longer a man, he was a tree….Insarov had to climb along its gnarled branches.He clung, and fell with his breast on a sharp stone, and Karolina Vogelmeier was sitting on her heels, looking like a pedlar-woman, and lisping: ‘Pies, pies, pies for sale’; and there were streams of blood and swords flashing incessantly….Elena!And everything vanished is a crimson chaos."
"第二十五章","CHAPTER XXV"
"“有个人在外面，看起来像个锁匠之类的。”第二天傍晚，别尔谢涅夫那个举止得体却对他疑神疑鬼的仆人对他说道，“他说是来拜访您的。”","‘There’s some one here looks like a locksmith or something of the sort,’ Bersenyev was informed the following evening by his servant, who was distinguished by a severe deportment and sceptical turn of mind towards his master; ‘he wants to see you.’"
"“让他进来吧。”别尔谢涅夫说。","‘Ask him in,’ said Bersenyev."
"那个“锁匠”走了进来。别尔谢涅夫认出他就是那个裁缝，因萨罗夫的房东。","The ‘locksmith’ entered.Bersenyev recognised in him the tailor, the landlord of Insarov’s lodgings."
"“请问有何贵干？”别尔谢涅夫问道。","‘What do you want?’ he asked him."
"“我是专程来找您的，阁下。”裁缝说，他的两只脚不停地挪动，不时地晃晃用最后三根手指捏着袖口的右手。“我的那个房客，好像病得很重。”","‘I came to your honour,’ began the tailor, shifting from one foot to the other, and at times waving his right hand with his cuff clutched in his three last fingers.‘Our lodger, seemingly, is very ill.’"
"“因萨罗夫？”","‘Insarov?’"
"“是的，我们的房客，肯定是他。他昨天早上还好好的，到了晚上却什么都不想吃，只要了水，我夫人就给他端了水过去，但是到了夜里，他就开始大吼大叫了，我们隔着一堵墙都听得一清二楚，而今天早上，他像跟木头似的躺在那里一动不动，发着高烧。愿主保佑我们！我想，我敢保证，他肯定会死，我想我应该向警察局汇报一声。因为他孤身一人。不过，我妻子说‘你去找找他的那个朋友，那个和我们房客一起住在乡下的人，也许他会告诉你该怎么办，或者他会亲自过来一趟。’所以我就来找阁下您了，我们也没有办法，就是说……”","‘Yes, our lodger, to be sure; yesterday morning he was still on his legs, in the evening he asked for nothing but drink; the missis took him some water, and at night he began talking away; we could hear him through the partition-wall; and this morning he lies without a word like a log, and the fever he’s in, Lord have mercy on us!I thought, upon my word, he’ll die for sure; I ought to send word to the police station, I thought.For he’s so alone; but the missis said: “Go to that gentleman,” she says, “at whose country place our lodger stayed; maybe he’ll tell you what to do, or come himself.” So I’ve come to your honour, for we can’t, so to say—’"
"别尔谢涅夫拽过自己的帽子，给了裁缝一卢布，立马和他一同坐着马车赶往因萨罗夫租住的房间。","Bersenyev snatched up his cap, thrust a rouble into the tailor’s hand, and at once set off with him post haste to Insarov’s lodgings."
"别尔谢涅夫发现因萨罗夫穿着衣服、人事不省地躺在沙发上。他的脸色变得很难看。别尔谢涅夫立刻让房东给他脱了衣服并把他抬到床上，自己则飞奔出去，找了一个医生过来。医生立刻开了水蛭、芥末膏、甘汞，并且给他放血。","He found him lying on the sofa, unconscious and not undressed.His face was terribly changed.Bersenyev at once ordered the people of the house to undress him and put him to bed, while he rushed off himself and returned with a doctor.The doctor prescribed leeches, mustard-poultices, and calomel, and ordered him to be bled."
"“他有生命危险吗？”别尔谢涅夫问道。","‘Is he dangerously ill?’ asked Bersenyev."
"“有的，非常危险。”医生回答道，“是急性肺炎，已经恶化成传染性胸膜炎了，大脑可能已经受到感染，不过好在病人还年轻。他正在与病魔抗争。我到这里的时候就已经太晚了，但是我还是会按照科学的方法来为他治疗、全力以赴。”","‘Yes, very dangerously,’ answered the doctor.‘Severe inflammation of the lungs; peripneumonia fully developed, and the brain perhaps affected, but the patient is young.His very strength is something against him now.I was sent for too late; still we will do all that science dictates.’"
"医生很年轻，也相信科学。","The doctor was young himself, and still believed in science."
"别尔谢涅夫在那里留了一整夜。房东夫妇似乎都是热心肠的人，只要有人吩咐，他们就立刻去做。医生的助手到了，然后开始了治疗。","Bersenyev stayed the night.The people of the house seemed kind, and even prompt directly there was some one to tell them what was to be done.An assistant arrived, and began to carry out the medical measures."
"将近清晨的时候，因萨罗夫醒了一小会儿，认出了别尔谢涅夫，问：“我生病了么？”他用重病患者所有的茫然、无神、困惑的眼光看向别尔谢涅夫周围，然后又昏睡了过去。别尔谢涅夫回了趟家，换了衣服，带了几本书，又回到因萨罗夫租住的房间。他下定决心至少要在那里呆上一段时间。他用屏风把因萨罗夫的床隔开，然后用沙发给自己弄了个休息的地方。这一天过得漫长又乏味。别尔谢涅夫除了用餐以外，其他时间都一直留在房间里面。夜幕降临了。他点上蜡烛，用灯罩罩了起来，然后开始看书。周围一片寂静。透过隔墙可以听见房东夫妇悄悄说话的声音，接着是哈欠声，还有叹息声。有人打了个喷嚏，随后被人小声地咒骂了一句。隔着屏风能听到病人低沉而急促的呼吸声，夹杂着几声短促的呻吟声和头不安地在枕头上磨蹭的声音……一个怪异的场景浮现在别尔谢涅夫眼前。他发现自己如今身处的这个房间的主人命悬一线，他也知道，埃琳娜爱着这个人……他依然记得那个夜晚，舒宾赶上他后清楚地告诉他，埃琳娜爱的是他，是他，别尔谢涅夫！可是现在……“现在我该怎么做呢？”他问着自己，“让埃琳娜知道他生病了？还是等等再说？这件事比以往我跟她讲的任何事都要糟糕。不可思议的是，命运总要让我夹在他们两人之间！”他下定决心过一阵子再跟埃琳娜说。他的目光落在了堆满信纸的桌子上……“他能完成他的梦想吗？”别尔谢涅夫思索着，“这一切会不会成为一场空呢？”他为这个被病魔击倒的年轻人而感到惋惜，他发誓，自己要尽可能地拯救他。","Towards morning Insarov revived for a few minutes, recognised Bersenyev, asked: ‘Am I ill, then?’ looked about him with the vague, listless bewilderment of a man dangerously ill, and again relapsed into unconsciousness.Bersenyev went home, changed his clothes, and, taking a few books along with him, he returned to Insarov’s lodgings.He made up his mind to stay there, at least for a time.He shut in Insarov’s bed with screens, and arranged a little place for himself by the sofa.The day passed slowly and drearily.Bersenyev did not leave the room except to get his dinner.The evening came.He lighted a candle with a shade, and settled down to a book.Everything was still around.Through the partition wall could be heard suppressed whispering in the landlord’s room, then a yawn, and a sigh.Some one sneezed, and was scolded in a whisper; behind the screen was heard the patient’s heavy, uneven breathing, sometimes broken by a short groan, and the uneasy tossing of his head on the pillow….Strange fancies came over Bersenyev.He found himself in the room of a man whose life was hanging on a thread, the man whom, as he knew, Elena loved….He remembered that night when Shubin had overtaken him and declared that she loved him, him, Bersenyev!And now….‘What am I to do now?’ he asked himself.‘Let Elena know of his illness?Wait a little?This would be worse news for her than what I told her once before; strange how fate makes me the go-between between them!’He made up his mind that it was better to wait a little.His eyes fell on the table covered with heaps of papers…‘Will he carry out his dreams?’ thought Bersenyev.‘Can it be that all will come to nothing?’And he was filled with pity for the young life struck down, and he vowed to himself to save it."
"这是个不安之夜。病人说了不少胡话。有几次别尔谢涅夫从小沙发上站起，小心翼翼地走到床的旁边，强忍心中的不安聆听他那断断续续的呓语。只有一次，因萨罗夫突然很清晰地说道：“我不要，我不要，她不能……”别尔谢涅夫吃了一惊，看着因萨罗夫。他的脸看上去非常痛苦，仿佛死人一样，同时又一动不动，他的手无力地放在床上。“我不要。”他用几乎听不到的声音重复着。","The night was an uneasy one.The sick man was very delirious.Several times Bersenyev got up from his little sofa, approached the bed on tip-toe, and listened with a heavy heart to his disconnected muttering.Only once Insarov spoke with sudden distinctness: ‘I won’t, I won’t, she mustn’t….’ Bersenyev started and looked at Insarov; his face, suffering and death-like at the same time, was immovable, and his hands lay powerless.‘I won’t,’ he repeated, scarcely audibly."
"医生第二天一早就来了，摇了摇头，开了一份新的处方。“危险期恐怕还要持续很长时间。”他边说边戴上帽子。","The doctor came in the morning, shook his head and wrote fresh prescriptions.‘The crisis is a long way off still,’ he said, putting on his hat."
"“那过了危险期呢？”别尔谢涅夫问道。","‘And after the crisis?’ asked Bersenyev."
"“过了危险期有两种结果，康复，或者死亡。”","‘The crisis may end in two ways, aut Caesar aut nihil."
"医生说完就离开了。别尔谢涅夫在外面的街道上来回地踱着步，他需要呼吸新鲜空气。他回到房间里，又看起书来。他很早以前就读完了劳默尔的书，现在正在研究格罗特。","The doctor went away.Bersenyev walked a few times up and down the street; he felt in need of fresh air.He went back and took up a book again.Raumer he had finished long ago; he was now making a study of Grote."
"突然，房门咯吱响了一声，房东的女儿小心地露出头来，她像往日一样裹着一块大头巾。","Suddenly the door softly creaked, and the head of the landlord’s daughter, covered as usual with a heavy kerchief, was cautiously thrust into the room."
"“那次给了我一个银币的小姐，”她轻轻说道，“她来了。”","‘Here is the lady,’ she whispered, ‘who gave me a silver piece.’"
"这个小孩子的头一下子就消失了，埃琳娜走了进来。","The child’s head vanished quickly, and in its place appeared Elena."
"别尔谢涅夫像被针刺了一样跳了起来，但是埃琳娜纹丝不动，也没有叫出声来。看样子，她似乎一瞬间什么都清楚了。她的脸色惨白，走到屏风旁边，向后面看了看，抬起手臂，似乎变成了石头。","Bersenyev jumped up as if he had been stung; but Elena did not stir, nor cry out.It seemed as if she understood everything in a single instant.A terrible pallor overspread her face, she went up to the screen, looked behind it, threw up her arms, and seemed turned to stone."
"如果再多看一会儿，她会扑到因萨罗夫身上去，但是别尔谢涅夫阻止了她。“你在做什么？”他低声颤抖着说，“你知不知道这样会害死他的！”","A moment more and she would have flung herself on Insarov, but Bersenyev stopped her.‘What are you doing?’ he said in a trembling whisper, ‘you might be the death of him!’"
"她有些头昏。别尔谢涅夫把她扶到沙发上坐下。","She was reeling.He led her to the sofa, and made her sit down."
"她看了看他的脸，又从头到脚打量了他一遍，然后呆呆地盯着地板。","She looked into his face, then her eyes ran over him from head to foot, then stared at the floor."
"“他会死吗？”她冰冷、平静的语气让别尔谢涅夫一阵毛骨悚然。","‘Will he die?’ she asked so coldly and quietly that Bersenyev was frightened."
"“上帝保佑，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”他说，“你怎么会这样说呢？”“他是病了，而且确实相当严重，但是我们会救他的，我向你保证。”","‘For God’s sake, Elena Nikolaevna,’ he began, ‘what are you saying?He is ill certainly—and rather seriously—but we will save him; I promise you that.’"
"“他已经不省人事了？”她的声音依然冰冷、平静。","‘He is unconscious?’ she asked in the same tone of voice as before."
"“是的，他目前还没有醒过来。这是这种病的初期表现，但是这没什么，没什么——我向你保证。喝点儿水吧。”","‘Yes, he is unconscious at present.That’s always the case at the early stage of these illnesses, but it means nothing, nothing—I assure you.Drink some water.’"
"她把头抬起来看着他，他发现她并没有听到刚才他说了些什么。","She raised her eyes to his, and he saw she had not heard his answer."
"“如果他死了，”她还是用那种声音说，“我也会跟他一起死。”","‘If he dies,’ she said in the same voice,‘ I will die too.’"
"在那一刻因萨罗夫轻轻呻吟了一下。她浑身颤抖起来，抱着头，然后她解开了帽带。","At that instant Insarov uttered a slight moan; she trembled all over, clutched at her head, then began untying the strings of her hat."
"“你想干什么？”别尔谢涅夫问她。","‘What are you doing?’Bersenyev asked her."
"“我要留在这里。”","‘I will stay here.’"
"“你要呆——很久？”","‘You will stay—for long?’"
"“我不知道，也许一天，也许一夜，也许一直——我不知道。”","‘I don’t know, perhaps all day, the night, always—I don’t know.’"
"“上帝保佑，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，你不要激动。我无论如何没有想到你会过来，不过，我还是——觉得你应该只能呆一会儿吧。别忘了你的家人会找你的。”","‘For God’s sake, Elena Nikolaevna, control yourself.I could not of course have any expectation of seeing you here; but still I—assume you have come for a short time.Remember they may miss you at home.’"
"“那又怎么样？”","‘What then?’"
"“他们会到处找你——会找到你——”","‘They will look for you—find you—’"
"“然后呢？”","‘What then?’"
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜！你要知道。他现在不能保护你。”","‘Elena Nikolaevna!You see.He cannot now protect you.’"
"她垂下头，看起来像是在思考，然后把手帕放到嘴边。突然从她的胸口处迸发出不住的抽泣，残暴地撕裂着她。她一头扑到沙发上，尽量忍住哭声，但是她的身体还是像刚被捉住的小鸟一样浑身颤抖着。","She dropped her head, seemed lost in thought, raised a handkerchief to her lips, and convulsive sobs, tearing her by their violence, were suddenly wrung from her breast.She threw herself, face downwards, on the sofa, trying to stifle them, but still her body heaved and throbbed like a captured bird."
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜——上帝保佑。”别尔谢涅夫在她头上重复着。","‘Elena Nikolaevna—for God’s sake,’ Bersenyev was repeating over her."
"“啊！怎么了？”因萨罗夫的声音突然响起。","‘Ah!What is it?’ suddenly sounded the voice of Insarov."
"埃琳娜惊得直起身来，别尔谢涅夫也在原地愣住了。过了片刻，他走到床前。因萨罗夫的头还是像原来那样无力地靠在枕头上，闭着眼睛。","Elena started up, and Bersenyev felt rooted to the spot.After waiting a little, he went up to the bed.Insarov’s head lay on the pillow helpless as before; his eyes were closed."
"“他是在说胡话吗？”埃琳娜轻轻问。","‘Is he delirious?’ whispered Elena."
"“也许吧，”别尔谢涅夫说，“不过这没什么，他总是这样，特别是——”","‘It seems so,’ answered Bersenyev, ‘but that’s nothing; it’s always so, especially if—’"
"“他是什么时候病倒的？”埃琳娜打断他。","‘When was he taken ill?’Elena broke in."
"“前天，我是昨天到这里的。相信我，埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜。我会一直守护着他的，一切都会好的。如果需要的话，我们会进行会诊。”","‘The day before yesterday; I have been here since yesterday.Rely on me, Elena Nikolaevna.I will not leave him; everything shall be done.If necessary, we will have a consultation.’"
"“他会死去，而我不在他身边。”她哭着说，双手用力握着。","‘He will die without me,’ she cried, wringing her hands."
"“我向你保证我会每天告诉你他病情的变化，如果有危险的话——”","‘I give you my word I will let you hear every day how his illness goes on, and if there should be immediate danger—’"
"“请你向我发誓，你会立刻写个纸条给我，不论是白天还是黑夜，直接写个纸条给我，我现在什么都不在乎了。你听见了吗？你能向我保证你会这样做吗？”","’Swear you will send for me at once whenever it may be, day or night, write a note straight to me—I care for nothing now.Do you hear?you promise you will do that?’"
"“我在上帝面前保证。”","‘I promise before God.’"
"“发誓。”","‘Swear it.’"
"“我发誓！”","‘I swear.’"
"她突然抓住他的手，赶在他缩回去之前，弯下腰吻了上去。","She suddenly snatched his hand, and before he had time to pull it away, she had bent and pressed her lips to it."
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，你——”他结结巴巴地说。","‘Elena Nikolaevna, what are you—’ he stammered."
"“不——不——我不要——”因萨罗夫含糊地说，然后痛苦地叹了口气。","‘No—no—I won’t have it—’ Insarov muttered indistinctly, and sighed painfully."
"埃琳娜走到屏风前，咬着手帕，久久地看着那个病人。眼泪静静地从她的脸颊滑落下来。","Elena went up to the screen, her handkerchief pressed between her teeth, and bent a long, long look on the sick man.Silent tears rolled down her cheeks."
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”别尔谢涅夫对她说，“他要是清醒过来看到你的话，天知道，这会不会刺激到他。另外，我一直在等着医生来。”","‘Elena Nikolaevna,’ Bersenyev said to her, ‘he might come to himself and recognise you; there’s no knowing if that wouldn’t do harm.Besides, from hour to hour I expect the doctor.’"
"埃琳娜把帽子从沙发上拿起来戴上，然后静静地站着。她用悲痛的目光扫视了这间屋子。她仿佛想起来什么似的……","Elena took her hat from the sofa, put it on and stood still.Her eyes strayed mournfully over the room.She seemed to be remembering…."
"“我不能走啊！”她最后轻轻地说。","‘I cannot go away,’ she whispered at last."
"别尔谢涅夫抓紧她的手。“你要振作起来，”他说，“平静下来，我会照顾好他的。我今天晚上就去找你。”","Bersenyev pressed her hand: ‘Try to pull yourself together,’ he said, ‘calm yourself; you are leaving him in my care.I will come to you this very evening.’"
"埃琳娜看着他说：“哦，我好心的朋友！”然后便呜咽着跑了出去。","Elena looked at him, said: ‘Oh, my good, kind friend!’ broke into sobs and rushed away."
"别尔谢涅夫靠在墙上。一种难过、苦涩却又奇怪地带点儿欣慰的感觉笼罩了他的心。“我好心的朋友！”他想了想，耸了耸肩。","Bersenyev leaned against the door.A feeling of sorrow and bitterness, not without a kind of strange consolation, overcame him.‘My good, kind friend!’ he thought and shrugged his shoulders."
"“谁在这里？”他听见因萨罗夫的声音。","‘Who is here?’ he heard Insarov’s voice."
"别尔谢涅夫走到他的旁边。“是我在这里，德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇。你还好吗？感觉怎么样？”","Bersenyev went up to him.‘I am here, Dmitri Nikanorovitch.How are you?How do you feel?’"
"“就你一个人吗？”病人问道。","‘Are you alone?’ asked the sick man."
"“是啊。”","‘Yes.’"
"“那她呢？”","‘And she?’"
"“你说的是谁？”别尔谢涅夫有些惊慌地问道。","‘Whom do you mean?’Bersenyev asked almost in dismay."
"因萨罗夫没有回答。“木犀香水味。”他喃喃地说着又闭上了眼睛。","Insarov was silent.‘Mignonette,’ he murmured, and his eyes closed again."
"第二十六章","CHAPTER XXVI"
"因萨罗夫在生与死之间徘徊了八天八夜。医生也不时地过来探望他，像年轻人对待难题时那样兴趣浓厚。舒宾听说了因萨罗夫危险的处境，询问了他的病情。他的同胞们——几个保加利亚人——来了。别尔谢涅夫认出了其中两个奇怪的人，他们就是之前突然到别墅找因萨罗夫，让他感到疑惑的人。他们都对此事表现出了真挚的同情，有些人还表示说要代替别尔谢涅夫在床前照顾因萨罗夫，但是他一直牢记对埃琳娜的承诺因此没有答应。他每天都去找埃琳娜，秘密地——有时直接说给她听，有时写一个字条——向她报告因萨罗夫的详细病情。她每天都急切地期盼他的到来，仔细听他说的话，认真地向他询问。她一直想去亲自探望因萨罗夫，但是别尔谢涅夫请求她不要这样做：这几天因萨罗夫身边总有人。她得知因萨罗夫生病的第一天自己也差点儿病倒了。她一回到家中就把自己关在了房间中，但又被叫去吃晚餐。她出现在餐厅的时候脸色十分可怕，把安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜吓得赶忙让她到床上去休息。无论如何，埃琳娜还是成功地控制住了自己的情绪。“如果他死了，”她重复着，“那我就跟着他一起死。”这个念头让她平静了下来，让她看起来镇静了一些。而且，谁也没去打扰她。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜忙着治疗她那肿胀的脸；舒宾疯狂地埋头于工作之中；卓娅也陷入了哀思之中，读起了《维特》；尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇对别尔谢涅夫“这位学者”的频繁造访非常反感，尤其因为他那与库尔纳托夫斯基有关的“倍受珍视的计划”没有任何进展；务实的高级秘书也十分困扰，等待着合适的时机。埃琳娜甚至没有向别尔谢涅夫致谢。向某些帮助致谢反而是件残酷、可耻的事。只是在他第四次造访时——那天夜里因萨罗夫的情况非常糟糕，医生也暗示需要一次会诊——只是在那时，她才提醒别尔谢涅夫曾许下的诺言。“很好，那我们走吧。”他对她说，她起身正准备穿衣服。“不，”他又决定说，“还是等到明天再去吧。”快到晚上的时候，因萨罗夫的情况有所好转。","For eight whole days Insarov lay between life and death.The doctor was incessantly visiting him, interested as a young man in a difficult case.Shubin heard of Insarov’s critical position, and made inquiries after him.His compatriots—Bulgarians—came; among them Bersenyev recognised the two strange figures, who had puzzled him by their unexpected visit to the cottage; they all showed genuine sympathy, some offered to take Bersenyev’s place by the patient’s bed-side; but he would not consent to that, remembering his promise to Elena.He saw her every day and secretly reported to her—sometimes by word of mouth, sometimes in a brief note—every detail of the illness.With what sinkings of the heart she awaited him, how she listened and questioned him!She was always on the point of hastening to Insarov herself; but Bersenyev begged her not to do this: Insarov was seldom alone.On the first day she knew of his illness she herself had almost fallen ill; directly she got home, she shut herself up in her room; but she was summoned to dinner, and appeared in the dining-room with such a face that Anna Vassilyevna was alarmed, and was anxious to put her to bed.Elena succeeded, however, in controlling herself.‘If he dies,’ she repeated, ‘it will be the end of me too.’This thought tranquillised her, and enabled her to seem indifferent.Besides no one troubled her much; Anna Vassilyevna was taken up with her swollen face; Shubin was working furiously; Zoya was given up to pensiveness, and disposed to read Werther; Nikolai Artemyevitch was much displeased at the frequent visits of ‘the scholar,’ especially as his ‘cherished projects’ in regard to Kurnatovsky were making no way; the practical chief secretary was puzzled and biding his time.Elena did not even thank Bersenyev; there are services for which thanks are cruel and shameful.Only once at her fourth interview with him—Insarov had passed a very bad night, the doctor had hinted at a consultation—only then she reminded him of his promise.‘Very well, then let us go,’ he said to her.She got up and was going to get ready.‘No,’ he decided, ‘let us wait till to-morrow.’Towards evening Insarov was rather better."
"这种折磨足足持续了八天。埃琳娜表面上很平静，但她日不能食，夜不能寐。她感觉四肢麻木，脑子里像充满了一种干燥的烟雾一样。“我的小姐像蜡烛一样越来越削瘦了。”她的女佣这样描述她。","For eight days this torture was prolonged.Elena appeared calm; but she could eat nothing, and did not sleep at night.There was a dull ache in all her limbs; her head seemed full of a sort of dry burning smoke.‘Our young lady’s wasting like a candle,’ her maid said of her."
"到了第九天，病人总算度过了危险期。在客厅中，埃琳娜坐在安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜旁边，给母亲读着《莫斯科公报》，却不知道自己到底在做什么。别尔谢涅夫走了进来。埃琳娜看了他一眼——每次她看他的第一眼都是那么迅速、恐惧、敏锐、战战兢兢——然后立刻就发现，他带来的是好消息。他面带笑容，轻轻朝她点了点头，她站起身来走到他旁边。","At last by the ninth day the crisis was passing over.Elena was sitting in the drawing-room near Anna Vassilyevna, and, without knowing herself what she was doing, was reading her the Moscow Gazette; Bersenyev came in.Elena glanced at him—how rapid, and fearful, and penetrating, and tremulous, was the first glance she turned on him every time—and at once she guessed that he brought good news.He was smiling; he nodded slightly to her, she got up to go and meet him."
"“他已经恢复意识了，命总算是保住了，一个星期内他就能恢复如初了。”他悄悄对她说。","‘He has regained consciousness, he is saved, he will be quite well again in a week,’ he whispered to her."
"埃琳娜像是挡住袭击一样伸开双臂，她一句话都没说，只有嘴唇在轻轻颤抖，脸上流露出美丽的红晕。别尔谢涅夫开始与安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜聊天，而埃琳娜走进自己的房间，跪倒在地，开始祈祷，感谢上帝。晶莹的泪水流过她的脸颊。她突然觉得非常疲倦，便把头放在枕头上，喃喃了一句：“可怜的安德烈·彼得罗维奇！”然后带着湿湿的睫毛和脸颊进入了梦乡。她已经很久没有休息和哭泣过了。","Elena had stretched out her arm as though to ward off a blow, and she said nothing, only her lips trembled and a flush of crimson overspread her whole face.Bersenyev began to talk to Anna Vassilyevna, and Elena went off to her own room, dropped on her knees and fell to praying, to thanking God.Light, shining tears trickled down her cheeks.Suddenly she was conscious of intense weariness, laid her head down on the pillow, whispered ‘poor Andrei Petrovitch!’ and at once fell asleep with wet cheeks and eyelashes.It was long since she had slept or wept."
"第二十七章","CHAPTER XXVII"
"事实证明别尔谢涅夫的话只说对了一部分。因萨罗夫虽然脱离了生命危险，但是身体恢复得非常缓慢，医生说他的整个身体系统都受到了严重的损伤。尽管如此，病人还是从床上爬了起来，开始在屋子里来回走动。别尔谢涅夫也回到自己的家中，但是他每天都会过来看望这位仍然虚弱的朋友，也像往常那样每天把因萨罗夫的身体状况告诉埃琳娜。因萨罗夫不敢写信给她，只是在与别尔谢涅夫的谈话中拐弯抹角地提起她，但是别尔谢涅夫却装作无所谓的样子，告诉因萨罗夫他曾多次拜访斯塔霍夫家，千方百计地让他知道埃琳娜之前有多么难过，而现在已经平静多了。埃琳娜也没有写信给因萨罗夫，她心里已经有了一个计划。","Bersenyev’s words turned out only partly true; the danger was over, but Insarov gained strength slowly, and the doctor talked of a complete undermining of the whole system.The patient left his bed for all that, and began to walk about the room; Bersenyev went home to his own lodging, but he came every day to his still feeble friend; and every day as before he informed Elena of the state of his health.Insarov did not dare to write to her, and only indirectly in his conversations with Bersenyev referred to her; but Bersenyev, with assumed carelessness, told him about his visits to the Stahovs, trying, however, to give him to understand that Elena had been deeply distressed, and that now she was calmer.Elena too did not write to Insarov; she had a plan in her head."
"一天，别尔谢涅夫兴高采烈地来告诉她医生已经允许因萨罗夫吃些肉饼了，也许用不了多久他就能走出房门了，但她看起来却在发愣，头垂得很低。","One day Bersenyev had just informed her with a cheerful face that the doctor had already allowed Insarov to eat a cutlet, and that he would probably soon go out; she seemed absorbed, dropped her eyes."
"“你能猜出我想对你说什么吗？”她说。别尔谢涅夫感到困惑。他知道她在想什么。","‘Guess, what I want to say to you,’ she said.Bersenyev was confused.He understood her."
"“我猜，”他看向别处，说道，“你想说你希望去探望他。”","‘I suppose,’ he answered, looking away, ‘you want to say that you wish to see him.’"
"埃琳娜涨得满脸通红，然后非常小声地说：“是的。”","Elena crimsoned, and scarcely audibly, she breathed, ‘Yes.’"
"“行啊，这有什么问题呢？我想这件事对你来说再简单不过了。”“呃！”他想着，“我的心里怎么会这么不情愿啊！”","‘Well, what then?That, I imagine, you can easily do.’—‘Ugh!’ he thought, ‘what a loath-some feeling there is in my heart!’"
"“你的意思是我已经……”埃琳娜说，“但是我害怕的是——你说过，他房间里经常有人。”","‘You mean that I have already before…’ said Elena.‘But I am afraid—now he is, you say, seldom alone.’"
"“这个问题不难解决。”别尔谢涅夫回答说，仍旧不看向她，“这件事自然不能由我事先提醒他，但你可以写个字条，我帮你给他。谁能阻止你给你关心的好朋友写个字条呢？这无伤大雅。约定——我的意思是，你写个字条告诉他你什么时候到。”","‘That’s not difficult to get over,’ replied Bersenyev, still not looking at her.‘I, of course, cannot prepare him; but give me a note.Who can hinder your writing to him as a good friend, in whom you take an interest?There’s no harm in that.Appoint—I mean, write to him when you will come."
"“我有点儿不好意思。”埃琳娜嘀咕道。","‘I am ashamed,’ whispered Elena."
"“把条子给我吧，我这就拿走。”","‘Give me the note, I will take it.’"
"“倒也不用那样，我只是想请求你——别生我的气，安德烈·彼得罗维奇——明天别去他那里！”","‘There’s no need of that, but I wanted to ask you—don’t be angry with me, Andrei Petrovitch—don’t go to him to-morrow!’"
"别尔谢涅夫咬了咬嘴唇。","Bersenyev bit his lip."
"“啊！是的，我知道，清楚，清楚。”他补充了这两三个字后便赶紧告辞了。","‘Ah! yes, I understand; very well, very well,’ and, adding two or three words more, he quickly took leave."
"“这样更好，这样更好。”他思索着，匆匆回到家里，“我什么都不知道，但是这样更好。我是怎么了，怎么想着把我自己和别人的幸福快乐绑在一起呢？我一点儿也不后悔，我凭着良心做了该做的事，而现在，一切都结束了。随他们去吧！父亲过去跟我说的是对的，‘你和我，我亲爱的小伙子，我们不是纵欲好色之徒，我们也不是达官贵人，我们都不受命运和上天的青睐，我们甚至都不能成为殉道者——我们就只是干活的人，仅此而已。穿上你的皮围裙吧，干活的人，坐到你的工作椅上去，呆在你那昏暗的作坊里，让阳光去照耀别的人吧！即使是我们单调呆板的生活也有它自己的骄傲和快乐啊！’”","‘So much the better, so much the better,’ he thought, as he hurried home.‘I have learnt nothing new, but so much the better.What possessed me to go hanging on to the edge of another man’s happiness?I regret nothing; I have done what my conscience told me; but now it is over.Let them be!My father was right when he used to say to me: “You and I, my dear boy, are not Sybarites, we are not aristocrats, we’re not the spoilt darlings of fortune and nature, we are not even martyrs—we are workmen and nothing more.Put on your leather apron, workman, and take your place at your workman’s bench, in your dark workshop, and let the sun shine on other men!Even our dull life has its own pride, its own happiness!”’"
"第二天一早，邮递员就给因萨罗夫送去一封短信。“等着我吧，”埃琳娜写道，“不要让任何人去看你。A. P. 也不会去。”","The next morning Insarov got a brief note by the post.‘Expect me,’ Elena wrote to him, ‘and give orders for no one to see you.A. P. will not come.’"
"第二十八章","CHAPTER XXVIII"
"因萨罗夫一看完埃琳娜的信就开始着手整理房间。他叫女房东把装药的瓶瓶罐罐收走，自己脱下睡衣，穿上外套。他的头晕乎乎的，心也因为虚弱和喜悦而悸动不已。他的腿颤颤巍巍的。他一屁股坐到沙发上，然后开始看表。“现在十二点还差一刻。”他自言自语道，“她十二点之前肯定来不了，现在还有十五分钟，我得想点别的什么，不然我会崩溃的。在十二点之前她无论如何到不了。”","Insarov read Elena’s note, and at once began to set his room to rights; asked his landlady to take away the medicine-glasses, took off his dressing-gown and put on his coat.His head was swimming and his heart throbbing from weakness and delight.His knees were shaking; he dropped on to the sofa, and began to look at his watch.‘It’s now a quarter to twelve,’ he said to himself.‘She can never come before twelve: I will think of something else for a quarter of an hour, or I shall break down altogether.Before twelve she cannot possibly come.’"
"门被打开了，埃琳娜穿着一袭素色丝质长裙走了进来。她脸色有些苍白，浑身充满了朝气和快乐。她快乐地呢喃了一声便扑进了他的怀里。","The door was opened, and in a light silk gown, all pale, all fresh, young and joyful, Elena came in, and with a faint cry of delight she fell on his breast."
"“你还活着，你是属于我的。”她一遍又一遍地说着，并且用双手紧紧地抱住他的头，抚摸着。面对这样的亲密、这样的浓情蜜意、这样的幸福，他觉得呼吸困难，快要晕厥过去了。","‘You are alive, you are mine,’ she repeated, embracing and stroking his head.He was almost swooning, breathless at such closeness, such caresses, such bliss."
"她坐在他的旁边，紧紧地抱住他，开始用双眼凝视着他，眼神里带着微笑，带着关爱和无限的柔情，这种眼神只能在充满爱意的女人眼里找到。","She sat down near him, holding him fast, and began to gaze at him with that smiling, and caressing, and tender look, only to be seen shining in the eyes of a loving woman."
"她的脸庞突然被忧郁笼罩。","Her face suddenly clouded over."
"“你现在太瘦了，我可怜的德米特里，”她说着用手去抚摸他的脖子，“你的胡子可真长啊。”","‘How thin you have grown, my poor Dmitri,’ she said, passing her hand over his neck; ‘what a beard you have.’"
"“你也瘦了，我可怜的埃琳娜。”他说着把埃琳娜的手贴到了他的嘴唇上。","‘And you have grown thin, my poor Elena,’ he answered, catching her fingers with his lips."
"她开心地甩了甩头发。","She shook her curls gaily."
"“这没什么大不了的。你看着吧，我们很快就能恢复强壮！暴风雨已经过去，就像我们相遇在小教堂那天一样，雨过天晴了。现在，我们要开始我们的生活了。”","‘That’s nothing.You shall see how soon we’ll be strong again!The storm has blown over, just as it blew over and passed away that day when we met in the chapel.Now we are going to live.’"
"他仅以一笑当作回答。","He answered her with a smile only."
"“德米特里，这段时间，这段时间是多么让人痛彻心扉！没有了爱人，人们怎能独活于世呢？我事先都知道安德烈·彼得罗维奇每天会对我说什么，我真的知道，我的生命跟你的一起潮起潮落。你能康复真好，我的德米特里！”","‘Ah, what a time we have had, Dmitri, what a cruel time!How can people outlive those they love?I knew beforehand what Andrei Petrovitch would say to me every day, I did really; my life seemed to ebb and flow with yours.Welcome back, my Dmitri!’"
"他不知道该跟她说些什么。他只想坐在她的脚边。","He did not know what to say to her.He was longing to throw himself at her feet."
"“我还注意到一些事情，”她继续说道，把头发向脑后拢了拢——“在这段闲下来的时间里我发现了好多事情——当一个人非常悲惨的时候，他会傻傻地注意着周围所发生的一切！有些时候，我会盯着一只苍蝇发呆，心里感到非常凄凉和恐惧！但是这一切都过去了，都过去了，不是吗？未来的一切都充满了阳光，不是吗？”","‘Another thing I observed,’ she went on, pushing back his hair—‘I made so many observations all this time in my leisure—when any one is very, very miserable, with what stupid attention he follows everything that’s going on about him!I really sometimes lost myself in gazing at a fly, and all the while such chill and terror in my heart!But that’s all past, all past, isn’t it?Everything’s bright in the future, isn’t it?’"
"“你就是我的未来，”因萨罗夫说，“所以我的未来是光明的。”","‘You are for me in the future,’ answered Insarov, ‘so it is bright for me.’"
"“对我也是一样的！你还记得吗，有一次我到你这里来，不是上一次，对，不是上一次。”她重复了一遍，身体不自觉地打了个寒颤，“我们说话的时候，我提到了死亡，我也不知道为什么会说起这个，我更没有想到，死神已经在旁边注视着我们。但是，你现在康复了，是吗？”","‘And for me too!But do you remember, when I was here, not the last time—no, not the last time,’ she repeated with an involuntary shudder, ‘when we were talking, I spoke of death, I don’t know why; I never suspected then that it was keeping watch on us.But you are well now, aren’t you?’"
"“我现在好多了，我已经快要完全康复了。”","‘I’m much better, I’m nearly well.’"
"“你很好，你还活着。哦，我太高兴了！”","‘You are well, you are not dead.Oh, how happy I am!’"
"随之而来的是一阵沉默。","A short silence followed."
"“埃琳娜？”因萨罗夫说。","‘Elena?’ said Insarov."
"“怎么了，亲爱的？”","‘Well, my dearest?’"
"“告诉我，你有没有想过，这场大病是上天对我们的惩罚？”","‘Tell me, did it never occur to you that this illness was sent us as a punishment?’"
"埃琳娜一脸严肃地看着他。","Elena looked seriously at him."
"“我确实这样想过，德米特里。但是我又想，为什么我要受到惩罚呢？我犯了什么罪，我触怒了哪位神明呢？也许我的良心跟别人不一样，但是我无愧于心，又或许我有愧于你？我是你的绊脚石，我拖了你的后腿。”","‘That idea did come into my head, Dmitri.But I thought: what am I to be punished for?What duty have I transgressed, against whom have I sinned?Perhaps my conscience is not like other people’s, but it was silent; or perhaps I am guilty towards you?I hinder you, I stop you.’"
"“你没有拖我的后腿，埃琳娜，我们将一起走下去。”","‘You don’t stop me, Elena; we will go together.’"
"“好的，德米特里，让我们永远在一起，我将永远追随你……那是我的责任。我爱你……我再没有别的责任。”","‘Yes, Dmitri, let us go together; I will follow you….That is my duty.I love you….I know no other duty.’"
"“哦，埃琳娜！”因萨罗夫说，“你的每一句话都像枷锁一样紧紧地束缚住了我！”","‘O Elena!’ said Insarov, ‘what chains every word of yours fastens on me!’"
"“怎么会是枷锁呢？”埃琳娜打断他，“我们都是没有羁绊的人，你和我。对的。”她眼睛盯着地板，若有所思，一只手依然在抚摸着他的头发，然后继续说道，“这段时间我经历了很多之前不懂的事情！如果以前有人告诉我，一个家教良好的女士，以各式各样编造出来的理由跑出了家，然后去了哪里呢？去了一个年轻男子的家中——我肯定会愤慨不已！现在，这真的成为了现实，但是我却没有一丝一毫的气愤。真的！”她把头转向因萨罗夫补充道。","‘Why talk of chains?’ she interposed.‘We are free people, you and I. Yes,’ she went on, looking musingly on the floor, while with one hand she still stroked his hair, ‘I experienced much lately of which I had never had any idea!If any one had told me beforehand that I, a young lady, well brought up, should go out from home alone on all sorts of made-up excuses, and to go where? to a young man’s lodgings—how indignant I should have been!And that has all come about, and I feel no indignation whatever.Really!’ she added, and turned to Insarov."
"他深情款款地注视着她。埃琳娜禁不住轻柔地把手从因萨罗夫的头发上放了下来，蒙住了他的眼睛。","He looked at her with such an expression of adoration, that she softly dropped her hand from his hair over his eyes."
"“德米特里！”她说，“你肯定不知道，我看到过你躺在这张可怕的床上，看到过你落入死神的手中、毫无知觉。”","‘Dmitri!’ she began again, ‘you don’t know of course, I saw you there in that dreadful bed, I saw you in the clutches of death, unconscious.’"
"“你看到过我？”","‘You saw me?’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"他沉默了一下。“那时别尔谢涅夫也在这里？”","He was silent for a little.‘And Bersenyev was here?’"
"她点了点头。","She nodded."
"因萨罗夫在埃琳娜跟前俯下身。“哦！埃琳娜！”他悄声说着，“我不敢看你了。”","Insarov bowed down before her.‘O Elena!’ he whispered, ‘I don’t dare to look at you.’"
"“为什么？安德烈·彼得罗维奇是个大好人。我不会因为他在而感到难为情。那还有什么可以让我不好意思的呢？我已经打算向大家宣布我是你的了……而我信任安德烈·彼得罗维奇就像信任一个哥哥一样。”","‘Why?Andrei Petrovitch is so good.I was not ashamed before him.And what have I to be ashamed of?I am ready to tell all the world that I am yours….And Andrei Petrovitch I trust like a brother.’"
"“他救了我！”因萨罗夫大声说,“他是这个世界上最高尚、最善良的人！”","‘He saved me!’ cried Insarov.‘He is the noblest, kindest of men!’"
"“是的……你知道吗？我欠他太多太多了。你知不知道是他最先跟我说你爱我的？如果我能告诉你一切……没错，他是个高尚的人。”","‘Yes…And do you know I owe everything to him?Do you know that it was he who first told me that you loved me?And if I could tell you everything….Yes, he is a noble man.’"
"因萨罗夫平静地看着埃琳娜。“他也爱着你，是吧？”","Insarov looked steadily at Elena.‘He is in love with you, isn’t he?’"
"埃琳娜把头垂了下去。“他确实爱过我。”她小声地说。","Elena dropped her eyes.‘He did love me,’ she said in an undertone."
"因萨罗夫温柔地捧起她的手。“哦，你们这些俄国人，”他说，“你们有金子般的心！他，他就这样一直守着我，整夜不合眼。而你，亲爱的，我的天使……你没有责备，毫不犹豫……而这一切都是为了我，为了我啊——”","Insarov pressed her hand warmly.‘Oh you Russians,’ he said, ‘you have hearts of pure gold!And he, he has been waiting on me, he has not slept at night.And you, you, my angel…. No reproaches, no hesitations… and all this for me, for me—’"
"“是的，这一切都是为了你，因为他们爱你，德米特里！真是匪夷所思啊！我想我以前应该给你讲过，但是没关系，我很高兴可以再说一次，你也一定会很想听的。当我第一次遇见你——”","‘Yes, yes, all for you, because they love you, Ah, Dmitri!How strange it is!I think I have talked to you of it before, but it doesn’t matter, I like to repeat it, and you will like to hear it.When I saw you the first time—’"
"“你眼睛里为什么含着泪水呢？”因萨罗夫打断了她。","‘Why are there tears in your eyes?’Insarov interrupted her."
"“眼泪？有吗？”她用手帕把眼泪擦干。“哦，小傻瓜！他不知道人们也会因为幸福而流泪。我想给你说，当我第一次看见你的时候，我并没有从你身上看出什么特别的地方，真的。我记得舒宾给我的印象更深，虽然我并不爱他。至于安德烈·彼得罗维奇嘛——哦，有一瞬间我确实在想，这就是我心中的那个他吗？对你，我没有任何这样的感觉。但是，后来——后来——你突然就偷走了我的心！”","‘Tears?Are there?’She wiped her eyes with her handkerchief.‘Oh, what a silly boy!He doesn’t know yet that people weep from happiness.I wanted to tell you: when I saw you the first time, I saw nothing special in you, really.I remember, Shubin struck me much more at first, though I never loved him, and as for Andrei Petrovitch—oh, there was a moment when I thought: isn’t this he?And with you there was nothing of that sort; but afterwards—afterwards—you took my heart by storm!’"
"“请原谅我。”因萨罗夫说。他想要站起来，但是刚一起身就又跌到沙发上。","‘Have pity on me,’ began Insarov.He tried to get up, but dropped down on to the sofa again at once."
"“你不舒服吗？”埃琳娜焦急地问道。","‘What’s the matter with you?’ inquired Elena anxiously."
"“没什么……我还是很虚弱。我还没办法承受这突如其来的幸福。”","‘Nothing….I am still rather weak.I am not strong enough yet for such happiness.’"
"“那你就安静地坐着。不要乱动，不要太过兴奋。”她用手指威胁他，说道，“你为什么要脱掉你的睡衣呢？你要恢复往日的风采还需要一段时间呢！坐下来，我给你讲故事。你只用静静地听着就好了。话说得太多也不利于你身体的恢复。”","‘Then sit quietly.Don’t dare to move, don’t get excited,’ she added, threatening him with her finger.‘And why have you left off your dressing-gown?It’s too soon to begin to be a dandy!Sit down and I will tell you stories.Listen and be quiet.To talk much is bad for you after your illness.’"
"她开始谈论舒宾，谈论库尔纳托夫斯基，谈论这两个星期她都做了些什么。她说，从报纸上看，战争似乎在所难免，因此他身体一好就必须争分夺秒地安排回国的事情。她就这样坐在他旁边，靠在他的肩膀上，慢慢地说着……","She began to talk to him about Shubin, about Kurnatovsky, and what she had been doing for the last fortnight, of how war seemed, judging from the newspapers, inevitable, and so directly he was perfectly well again, he must, without losing a minute, make arrangements for them to start.All this she told him sitting beside him, leaning on his shoulder…."
"他听着她侃侃而谈，脸色忽白忽红。有时候，他想让她停下来。突然，他坐直了身体。","He listened to her, listened, turning pale and red.Sometimes he tried to stop her; suddenly he drew himself up."
"“埃琳娜，”他用奇怪的声音对她说道，“离开我，快走。”","‘Elena,’ he said to her in a strange, hard voice ‘leave me, go away.’"
"“什么？”她困惑地说，很快又补充道，“你感觉不舒服？”","‘What?’ she replied in bewilderment ‘You feel ill?’ she added quickly."
"“不……我很好……只是，请你现在离开我吧。”","‘No… I’m all right… but, please, leave me now.’"
"“我不明白你的意思。你在赶我走？你在干什么？”她突然说道。他从沙发上俯下身去，几乎都要挨着地了，然后把嘴唇印在了她的脚上。“不要这样，德米特里……德米特里——”","‘I don’t understand you.You drive me away?..What are you doing?’ she said suddenly; he had bent over from the sofa almost to the ground, and was pressing her feet to his lips.‘Don’t do that, Dmitri…. Dmitri—’"
"他站了起来。","He got up."
"“那就离开我吧！你知道的，埃琳娜，我生病的时候，一开始我还没有失去意识，我知道我站在死亡深渊的旁边，甚至是发着高烧、说胡话的时候，我都模模糊糊地感受到死神要把我带走，我觉得我将要失去生命、失去你、失去这所有的一切。我放弃了希望……而这突然的起死回生，这黑暗过后的光明，你——你在我身边，陪着我——你的声音，你的呼吸……这都让我无法承受！我感觉到自己热烈地爱着你，我听到你说你是我的，但是我没有办法回答我自己……你走吧！”","‘Then leave me!You see, Elena, when I was taken ill, I did not lose consciousness at first; I knew I was on the edge of the abyss; even in the fever, in delirium I knew, I felt vaguely that it was death coming to me, I took leave of life, of you, of everything; I gave up hope….And this return to life so suddenly; this light after the darkness, you—you—near me, with me—your voice, your breath….It’s more than I can stand!I feel I love you passionately, I hear you call yourself mine, I cannot answer for myself…You must go!’"
"“德米特里。”埃琳娜把头靠在他的肩膀上，喃喃地说道。直到现在她才明白他的意思。","‘Dmitri,’ whispered Elena, and she nestled her head on his shoulder.Only now she understood him."
"“埃琳娜，”他继续说道，“我爱你，这你是知道的。我已经准备好随时为了你牺牲我自己……为什么你这个时候要在我的身边，在我还很虚弱的时候，在我还没有办法控制自己的时候，在我浑身的血液都像火一样在燃烧的时候……你说，你是我的……你爱我——”","‘Elena,’ he went on, ‘I love you, you know that; I am ready to give my life for you…. Why have you come to me now, when I am weak, when I can’t control myself, when all my blood’s on fire… you are mine, you say… you love me——’"
"“德米特里。”她又叫了一声，脸涨得通红，更用力地靠向他。","‘Dmitri,’ she repeated; she flushed all over, and pressed still closer to him."
"“埃琳娜，可怜可怜我，你快走吧，我感到我快要死了……我无法承受这么炽热的感情……我的整个灵魂都渴望着你……想想，死神差点儿把我们分开……但是现在，你就在这里，你就在我的怀里……”","‘Elena, have pity on me; go away, I feel as if I should die….I can’t stand these violent emotions… my whole soul yearns for you … think, death was almost parting us.. and now you are here, you are in my arms…"
"她浑身上下都颤抖了起来。“那就接受我吧！”她喘息着，用几乎听不到的声音说。","She was trembling all over.‘Take me, then,’ she whispered scarcely above her breath."
"第二十九章","CHAPTER XXIX"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇紧锁眉头，不停地在书房里走来走去。舒宾翘着二郎腿坐在窗户旁边，静静地抽着雪茄。","Nikolai Artemyevitch was walking up and down in his study with a scowl on his face.Shubin was sitting at the window with his legs crossed, tranquilly smoking a cigar."
"“拜托您不要再走来走去了。”他说着，弹了弹雪茄上的烟灰，“我一直在等着您说话，看得我脖子都快扭断了。还有，您这样来回踱步看上去有些不自然、有些夸张。”","‘Leave off tramping from corner to corner, please,’ he observed, knocking the ash off his cigar.‘I keep expecting you to speak; there’s a rick in my neck from watching you.Besides, there’s something artificial, melodramatic in your striding.’"
"“你只会开玩笑。”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇说，“你不是我，你无法感受我的心情。我已经很依赖那个女人了，事实上我无法与她分离，她的离开让我非常痛苦。现在已经十月份了，冬天马上就要来了……她在雷瓦尔干什么呢？”","‘You can never do anything but joke,’ responded Nikolai Artemyevitch.‘You won’t enter into my position, you refuse to realise that I am used to that woman, that I am attached to her in fact, that her absence is bound to distress me.Here it’s October, winter is upon us. … What can she be doing in Revel?’"
"“她想必是在织长袜——给她自己，给她自己——不是给您。”","‘She must be knitting stockings—for herself; for herself—not for you.’"
"“你尽管笑吧，尽管笑。我告诉你，没有一个女人像她那样。她是那样真诚，那样无私。”","‘You may laugh, you may laugh; but I tell you I know no woman like her.Such honesty; such disinterestedness.’"
"“她把那张支票兑现了吗？”舒宾问道。","‘Has she cashed that bill yet?’ inquired Shubin."
"“她是那样地无私。”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇重复道，“这太令人吃惊了。有人告诉我，这个世界上有成千上万的女人，我说，把这些女人给我瞧瞧吧，给我瞧瞧这数不清的女人！可她竟然连封信都不写——这是最让我难以忍受的！”","‘Such disinterestedness,’ repeated Nikolai Artemyevitch; ’it’s astonishing.They tell me there are a million other women in the world, but I say, show me the million; show me the million, I say; ces femmes, qu’on me les montre!And she doesn’t write—that’s what’s killing me!’"
"“您的口才可以跟毕达哥拉斯媲美了。”舒宾说，“但是，您知道我会给你什么样的建议吗？”","‘You’re eloquent as Pythagoras,’ remarked Shubin; ‘but do you know what I would advise you?’"
"“什么样的？”","‘What?’"
"“等到奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂亚诺夫娜回来的时候——您知道我的意思吧？”","‘When Augustina Christianovna comes back—you take my meaning?’"
"“知道，知道，那么，然后呢？”","‘Yes, yes; well, what?’"
"“当您再次看到她的时候——您知道我的意思吗？”","‘When you see her again—you follow the line of my thought?’"
"“是的，是的，当然知道。”","‘Yes, yes, to be sure.’"
"“试着打她一顿，看看会有什么结果。”","‘Try beating her; see what that would do.’"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇怒气冲冲地转过身去。","Nikolai Artemyevitch turned away exasperated."
"“我还以为他能给我一点儿实质上的建议。但是，哦，我怎么能指望他呢！一个艺术家，一个没有原则的人——”","‘I thought he was really going to give me some practical advice.But what can one expect from him!An artist, a man of no principles—’"
"“没有原则！哦，我倒是听说您最喜欢的库尔纳托夫斯基先生，一个有原则的人，昨晚在牌桌上赢了您一百卢布呢！您现在必须承认那种滋味不好受吧。”","‘No principles!By the way, I’m told your favourite Mr. Kurnatovsky, the man of principle, cleaned you out of a hundred roubles last night.That was hardly delicate, you must own now.’"
"“那有什么？我们那会儿玩得很开心。当然，我本来是想——但是这个房间里的人好像不懂得如何欣赏他——”","‘What of it?We were playing high.Of course, I might expect—but they understand so little how to appreciate him in this house—’"
"“所以他就想：那我就尽量地赢钱！”舒宾说，“他是不是我未来的岳父，这谁都说不清楚，但是一百卢布对一个不收受贿赂的人来说可是相当不错啊。”","‘That he thought: get what I can!’ put in Shubin: ‘whether he’s to be my father-in-law or not, is still on the knees of the gods, but a hundred roubles is worth something to a man who doesn’t take bribes.’"
"“岳父！该死的，我怎么会是他的岳父？你在说梦话吧，亲爱的。当然了，谁家的姑娘要有个这样的追求者一定会很高兴的。想想：他精神饱满，才华横溢，拥有一定的社会地位，在两个省供职——”","‘Father-in-law!How the devil am I his father-in-law?Vous revez, mon cher.Of course, any other girl would be delighted with such a suitor.Only consider: a man of spirit and intellect, who has gained a position in the world, served in two provinces—’"
"“其中一个省的省长都得听他的。”舒宾说。","‘Led the governor in one of them by the nose,’ remarked Shubin."
"“很有可能。肯定是这样，就应该如此。他又实际又有经济头脑——”","‘Very likely.To be sure, that’s how it should be.Practical, a business man—’"
"“也是玩牌的老手。”舒宾又评论了一句。","‘And a capital hand at cards,’ Shubin remarked again."
"“的确，他牌玩儿得不错。但是埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜……她在想什么呢？我倒是很想知道谁能猜出她到底在想什么。她高兴一天，难过一天，一会儿骨瘦如柴，让人不忍心看她，然后又突然好了，全然没有任何显而易见的缘由——”","‘To be sure, and a capital hand at cards.But Elena Nikolaevna….Is there any understanding her?I should be glad to know if there is any one who would undertake to make out what it is she wants.One day she’s cheerful, another she’s dull; all of a sudden she’s so thin there’s no looking at her, and then suddenly she’s well again, and all without any apparent reason—’"
"一个长相丑陋的仆人端着一个装有一杯咖啡、一些奶油和糖的盘子走了进来。","A disagreeable-looking man-servant came in with a cup of coffee, cream and sugar on a tray."
"“父亲对来求婚的小伙子很满意，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇掰下一块方糖，接着说道，“但是女儿是怎么想的呢！这要是在以前家长制的时代很好办，但是现在时代变了啊！这一切都变了啊！现在，年轻的姑娘们想跟谁聊天就跟谁聊天，想看什么书就看什么书，她们像在巴黎似的，独自一人就在莫斯科城晃悠，不带新郎，也不带女佣，而这一切都是被允许的。前几天我问‘埃琳娜去哪了？’他们告诉我她出去了。去了哪里？没人知道。这事儿——合适吗？”","‘The father is pleased with a suitor,’ pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch, breaking off a lump of sugar; ‘but what is that to the daughter!That was all very well in the old patriarchal days, but now we have changed all that.Nous avons change tout ca.Nowadays a young girl talks to any one she thinks fit, reads what she thinks fit; she goes about Moscow alone without a groom or a maid, just as in Paris; and all that is permitted.The other day I asked, “Where is Elena Nikolaevna?”I’m told she has gone out.Where?No one knows.Is that—the proper thing?’"
"“把您的咖啡端起来，让仆人下去。”舒宾说，“您自己也说过，有些话不能当着仆人的面说。”他压低声音补充道。","‘Take your coffee, and let the man go,’ said Shubin.‘You say yourself that one ought not devant les domestiques’ he added in an undertone."
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇端起咖啡，加了点儿奶油，拿了几块方糖。仆人则疑惑地看了舒宾一眼。","The servant gave Shubin a dubious look, while Nikolai Artemyevitch took the cup of coffee, added some cream, and seized some ten lumps of sugar."
"“刚刚仆人进来的时候我是想说，我在这屋子里毫无价值。总而言之就是这样。现如今，人们都以貌取人。有的人胸无点墨，但却弄出一副不可一世的表情，人们就会很尊敬他；但是还有些人成竹在胸——本可能脱颖而出，却表现得十分谦逊——”","‘I was just going to say when the servant came in,’ he began, ‘that I count for nothing in this house.That’s the long and short of the matter.For nowadays every one judges from appearances; one man’s an empty-headed fool, but gives himself airs of importance, and he’s respected; while another, very likely, has talents which might—which might gain him great distinction, but through modesty—’"
"“您生来就是个政治家吗？”舒宾调笑着问道。","‘Aren’t you a born statesman?’ asked Shubin in a jeering voice."
"“别再胡闹了！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇气愤地喊道，“你太忘乎所以了！看吧，这再次证明了我在这个屋子里毫无意义，一点儿都没有！”","‘Give over playing the fool!’Nikolai Artemyevitch cried with heat.‘You forget yourself!Here you have another proof that I count for nothing in this house, nothing!’"
"“难怪安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜能在您头上作威作福……可怜的家伙！”舒宾伸了个懒腰说着，“呵，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇，我们俩都有些过分！您最好为安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜准备一份小礼物，过两天就是她的生日了，您知道她多么在乎您对她的关怀，哪怕只有一点儿。”","‘Anna Vassilyevna ill-uses you… poor fellow!’ said Shubin, stretching.‘Ah, Nikolai Artemyevitch, we’re a pair of sinners!You had much better be getting a little present ready for Anna Vassilyevna, It’s her birthday in a day or two, and you know how she appreciates the least attention on your part.’"
"“没错，没错。”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇连忙答道，“谢谢你提醒我。当然，当然，那是肯定的。我有个小玩意儿，一个化妆匣，我前几天在‘玫瑰丛’买的，但是我不知道这个行不行。”","‘Yes, yes,’ answered Nikolai Artemyevitch hastily.‘I’m much obliged to you for reminding me.Of course, of course; to be sure.I have a little thing, a dressing-case, I bought it the other day at Rosenstrauch’s; but I don’t know really if it will do.’"
"“我猜您是买给那个在雷瓦尔的女士的吧？”","‘I suppose you bought it for her, the lady at Revel?’"
"“怎么了，那是当然。我当时是那样想的。”","‘Why, certainly.—I had some idea.’"
"“要是这样的话，肯定没问题。”舒宾从座位上站起来。","‘Well, in that case, it will be sure to do.’Shubin got up from his seat."
"“今天晚上我们出去玩吗，帕维尔·雅克夫利奇，嗯？”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇友善地看了他一眼，问道。","‘Are we going out this evening, Pavel Yakovlitch, eh?’Nikolai Artemyevitch asked with an amicable leer."
"“当然，怎么了，您是要去您的俱乐部吧。”","‘Why yes, you are going to your club.’"
"“俱乐部之后……之后。”","‘After the club… after the club.’"
"舒宾又伸了个懒腰。","Shubin stretched himself again."
"“不，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇，明天我还要工作。下次吧。”说完他便走了出去。","‘No, Nikolai Artemyevitch, I want to work tomorrow.Another time.’And he walked off."
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇皱着眉头，又在房里来来回回走了两圈。他从办公桌的抽屉里拿出来了一个天鹅绒盒子，里面装着那个化妆匣。他看了一会儿匣子，拿出一条丝质手帕来回擦拭着。然后，他在镜子前面坐下，开始仔细地整理他那浓密的黑头发。他带着优雅的表情把头偏向右，再偏向左，舌头紧贴着脸颊，眼睛一动不动地盯着他的分发线。有人在他背后咳嗽了一声。他扭过头去，看见是刚才为他送来咖啡的仆人。","Nikolai Artemyevitch scowled, walked twice up and down the room, took a velvet box with the dressing-case out of the bureau and looked at it a long while, rubbing it with a silk handkerchief.Then he sat down before a looking-glass and began carefully arranging his thick black hair, turning his head to right and to left with a dignified countenance, his tongue pressed into his cheek, never taking his eyes off his parting.Some one coughed behind his back; he looked round and saw the manservant who had brought him in his coffee."
"“你有什么事吗？”他问道。","‘What do you want?’ he asked him."
"“尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇老爷，您是我们的主人。”他郑重其事地说。","‘Nikolai Artemyevitch,’ said the man with a certain solemnity, ‘you are our master?’"
"“这我知道，有别的事吗？”","‘I know that; what next!’"
"“尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇老爷，请别生我的气，但是我从小开始就一直服侍您，我一直忠于您，所以我必须向您汇报——”","‘Nikolai Artemyevitch, graciously do not be angry with me; but I, having been in your honour’s service from a boy, am bound in dutiful devotion to bring you—’"
"“好吧，你说！”","‘Well what is it?’"
"仆人站在那里踌躇了一阵子。","The man shifted uneasily as he stood."
"“老爷，您刚才说，”他说，“您不知道埃琳娜小姐去了什么地方。我知道。”","‘You condescended to say, your honour,’ he began, ‘that your honour did not know where Elena Nikolaevna was pleased to go.I have information about that.’"
"“你在胡说些什么，白痴！”","‘What lies are you telling, idiot?’"
"“老爷您教训的是，不过我三天前看见小姐开心地走进了一座房子里！”","‘That’s as your honour likes, but I saw our young lady three days ago, as she was pleased to go into a house!’"
"“在哪？什么？什么房子？”","‘Where?what? what house?’"
"“波瓦尔斯基附近的一所房子。离这里不远。我还去向看门人打听了一下谁住在那里。”","‘In a house, near Povarsky.Not far from here.I even asked the doorkeeper who were the people living there.’"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇气得直跺脚。","Nikolai Artemyevitch stamped with his feet."
"“住嘴！恶棍！你怎么敢？埃琳娜有着一颗善良的心，她是去看望穷人，而你……滚出去，蠢货！”","‘Silence, scoundrel!How dare you?…Elena Nikolaevna, in the goodness of her heart, goes to visit the poor and you…Be off, fool!’"
"受了惊吓的仆人赶忙向门口窜去。","The terrified servant was rushing to the door."
"“等等！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇喊道，“那个看门的是怎么给你说的？”","‘Stop!’cried Nikolai Artemyevitch.‘What did the doorkeeper say to you?’"
"“哦，没——没什么——他什么也没说——他告诉我——一个学——学生——”","‘Oh no—nothing—he said nothing—He told me—a stu—student—’"
"“闭嘴，混蛋！听着，你这个混蛋，如果你敢说出去一个字，哪怕在梦里——”","‘Silence, scoundrel!Listen, you dirty beast; if you ever breathe a word in your dreams even—’"
"“请宽恕我——”","‘Mercy on us—’"
"“闭嘴！如果你敢说出去——如果任何人——如果让我发现——我就让你连死都无处藏身！听清楚了吗？你可以走了！”","‘Silence!if you blab—if any one—if I find out—you shall find no hiding-place even underground!Do you hear?You can go!’"
"仆人消失了。","The man vanished."
"“仁慈的主，善良的神啊！这说明了什么呢？”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇只身一人的时候思索着，“那个蠢货刚才说什么？嗯？但是我必须找出来是哪栋房子，是谁住在那里。我得亲自去一趟。都已经到这个地步了！狗奴才！太不成体统了！”","‘Good Heavens, merciful powers!what does it mean?’ thought Nikolai Artemyevitch when he was left alone.‘What did that idiot tell me?Eh? I shall have to find out, though, what house it is, and who lives there.I must go myself.Has it come to this!…Un laquais!Quelle humiliation!’"
"他又大声地重复道：“狗奴才！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇把化妆匣放进抽屉里，就去找安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜。他发现她躺在床上，脸用纱布包着。但她痛苦的模样只是让他更加生气，没多久，他就把她弄得眼泪汪汪的了。","And repeating aloud: ‘Un laquais!’Nikolai Artemyevitch shut the dressing-case up in the bureau, and went up to Anna Vassilyevna.He found her in bed with her face tied up.But the sight of her sufferings only irritated him, and he very soon reduced her to tears."
"第三十章","CHAPTER XXX"
"与此同时，一直在东欧酝酿的风暴终于爆发了。土耳其向俄国宣战，规定各公国撤离的期限已经到期，锡诺普大战就在眼前。因萨罗夫最近收到的好几封信都是急切召唤他回国的。他的身体还没有完全康复。他不停地咳嗽，觉得浑身无力，有时候还发低烧，但是他却无法安心呆在家中养病。他的心已经被点燃了，他已经无暇顾及自己的病情。他马不停蹄地在莫斯科各处奔走，秘密地跟各式各样的人会面，整夜整夜地写东西，几天几夜不见人影。他告诉房东说他不久以后就要搬走，已经把自己一些简单的家具送给了房东。埃琳娜也在做着动身前的准备。在一个下着雨的夜里，她在屋子里坐着，一边给手帕缝边，一边听着窗外风的呼啸声，不由得伤感起来。她的仆人来告诉她，她的父亲正在她母亲的房里，让她过去。“您的母亲在哭，”她悄悄地给正准备起身的埃琳娜说，“而您的父亲正大发雷霆。”","Meanwhile the storm gathering in the East was breaking.Turkey had declared war on Russia; the time fixed for the evacuation of the Principalities had already expired, the day of the disaster of Sinope was not far off.The last letters received by Insarov summoned him urgently to his country.His health was not yet restored; he coughed, suffered from weakness and slight attacks of fever, but he was scarcely ever at home.His heart was fired, he no longer thought of his illness.He was for ever rushing about Moscow, having secret interviews with various persons, writing for whole nights, disappearing for whole days; he had informed his landlord that he was going away shortly, and had presented him already with his scanty furniture.Elena too on her side was getting ready for departure.One wet evening she was sitting in her room, and listening with involuntary depression to the sighing of the wind, while she hemmed handkerchiefs.Her maid came in and told her that her father was in her mother’s room and sent for her there.‘Your mamma is crying,’ she whispered after the retreating Elena, ‘and your papa is angry.’"
"埃琳娜轻轻耸了耸肩，走进了她母亲的房间。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇那好心肠的妻子正半靠在一张躺椅子上，捧着一块有香水气味的手帕抽泣。尼古拉则独自一人在壁炉边站着，每颗扣子都扣得好好的，系着一个又高又硬的领结，衣领看上去十分僵硬、呆板，那派头有点儿国会演说家的味道。他用演说者的手势比划着让自己的女儿在一把椅子上坐下，可是他的女儿不明白他手势的意思，带着询问的目光看着他，他便头也不回、严肃地说道：“请您坐下。”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇平日里跟妻子说话是用“您”，但是只在极其特殊的情况下才会对女儿用“您”。","Elena gave a slight shrug and went into Anna Vassflyevna’s room.Nikolai Artemyevitch’s kind-hearted spouse was half lying on a reclining chair, sniffing a handkerchief steeped in eau de Cologne; he himself was standing at the hearth, every button buttoned up, in a high, hard cravat, with a stiffly starched collar; his deportment had a vague suggestion of some parliamentary orator.With an orator’s wave of the arm he motioned his daughter to a chair, and when she, not understanding his gesture, looked inquiringly at him, he brought out with dignity, without turning his head: ‘I beg you to be seated.’Nikolai Artemyevitch always used the formal plural in addressing his wife, but only on extraordinary occasions in addressing his daughter."
"埃琳娜坐了下来。","Elena sat down."
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜眼泪汪汪地清了清鼻子。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇把指头放进了上衣的衣襟里。","Anna Vassilyevna blew her nose tearfully.Nikolai Artemyevitch thrust his fingers between his coat-buttons."
"“埃琳娜·尼古拉耶夫娜，”在经过了一段时间的安静之后他说道，“我把你叫来是要跟你说清楚，或者说是叫你来跟我们说清楚。我对你很不满意——哦，不——这样说太委婉了：你的行为让我——让我和你的母亲——就是现在在你眼前的母亲——很痛苦，很愤怒。”","‘I sent for you, Elena Nikolaevna,’ he began after a protracted silence, ‘in order to have an explanation with you, or rather in order to ask you for an explanation.I am displeased with you—or no—that is too little to say: your behaviour is a pain and an outrage to me—to me and to your mother—your mother whom you see here.’"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇只让自己发出几个低低的声调。埃琳娜静静地看着他，然后又看了看安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜，脸色煞白。","Nikolai Artemyevitch was giving vent only to the few bass notes in his voice.Elena gazed in silence at him, then at Anna Vassilyevna and turned pale."
"“曾经有那么一段时期，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇接着说道，“那时候，女儿们必须尊重她们的父母——父母的威严能让不听话的孩子瑟瑟发抖。令人遗憾的是，那个时期已经不复存在，至少大多数人觉得那个时期已经过去了，但是让我来告诉你，在如今这个社会还是有一些规矩要守的，这些规矩无论如何也不允许——不允许——事实上，这些规矩还是存在的。我请您记住：这些规矩现在还是存在的——”","‘There was a time,’ Nikolai Artemyevitch resumed, ‘when daughters did not allow themselves to look down on their parents—when the parental authority forced the disobedient to tremble.That time has passed, unhappily: so at least many persons imagine; but let me tell you, there are still laws which do not permit—do not permit—in fact there are still laws.I beg you to mark that: there are still laws—’"
"“但是，父亲。”埃琳娜开口道。","‘But, papa,’ Elena was beginning."
"“请您让我把话说完。让我们想想过去发生的那些事。我和你母亲已经履行了我们的职责。我和你母亲为了让你接受良好的教育：不惜力也不惜钱。你从中得到了什么——这是另外一回事，但是我有权利希望——我和你母亲有权利希望你，我们唯一的女儿，至少能守住我们曾经灌输给你的道德原则。我们有权利去希望任何新的‘思想’都不会去触犯它，也可以这样说，它是神圣不可侵犯的。然而我们却发现了什么？我现在要说的并不是你这个年龄的女性在行为上的轻佻，而是你已经忘乎所以了——”","‘I beg you not to interrupt me.Let us turn in thought to the past.I and Anna Vassilyevna have performed our duty.I and Anna Vassilyevna have spared nothing in your education: neither care nor expense.What you have gained from our care—is a different question; but I had the right to expect—I and Anna Vassilyevna had the right to expect that you would at least hold sacred the principles of morality which we have—que nous avons inculques, which we have instilled into you, our only daughter.We had the right to expect that no new “ideas” could touch that, so to speak, holy shrine.And what do we find?I am not now speaking of frivolities characteristic of your sex, and age, but who could have anticipated that you could so far forget yourself—’"
"“父亲，”埃琳娜说，“我知道你要说什么——”","‘Papa,’ said Elena, ‘I know what you are going to say——’"
"“不，你不知道我要说什么！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇尖声叫道，突然失去了演说家的气派、讲话时的庄严以及那低沉的腔调。“你不明白，你这个贱人！”","‘No, you don’t know what I am going to say!’ cried Nikolai Artemyevitch in a falsetto shriek, suddenly losing the majesty of his oratorical pose, the smooth dignity of his speech, and his bass notes.‘You don’t know, vile hussy!’"
"“看在上帝的份上，尼古拉斯，”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜低声抱怨着，“你要逼死我吗？”","‘For mercy’s sake, Nicolas,’ murmured Anna Vassilyevna, ‘vous me faites mourir?’"
"“你别说什么我要逼死你的废话，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜！你永远也想不到你接下来要听到的事情！做好最坏的心理准备，我提醒你！”","‘Don’t tell me que je vous fais mourir, Anna Vassilyevna!You can’t conceive what you will hear directly!Prepare yourself for the worst, I warn you!’"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜似乎愣住了。","Anna Vassilyevna seemed stupefied."
"“不，”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇转向埃琳娜说，“你不知道我要说什么！”","‘No,’ resumed Nikolai Artemyevitch, turning to Elena, ‘you don’t know what I am going to say!’"
"“我真的很抱歉——”她说道。","‘I am to blame towards you—’ she began."
"“啊！你终于承认了！”","‘Ah, at last!’"
"“真的很抱歉，”埃琳娜接着说，“我没能早点儿承认——”","‘I am to blame towards you,’ pursued Elena, ‘for not having long ago confessed—’"
"“你知道吗？”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇打断她说，“我只需要说一个字就能让你恨不得找个地缝钻下去。”","‘But do you know,’ Nikolai Artemyevitch interrupted, ‘that I can crush you with one word?’"
"埃琳娜抬起头，看着他。","Elena raised her eyes to look at him."
"“是的，女士，我只用说一个字！你看着我也没用！”（他双手交叉放在胸前。）“让我问你，你知道不知道波瓦尔斯基旁边的某栋房子？你去过那栋房子吗？”（他跺着脚。）“回答我，不要脸的丫头，不要试图隐瞒真相。有人，人，仆人，小姐，早就有仆人，可恶的仆人看见你去了那里，去你的——”","‘Yes, madam, with one word!It’s useless to look at me!’ (He crossed his arms on his breast.)‘Allow me to ask you, do you know a certain house near Povarsky?Have you visited that house?’ (He stamped.)‘Answer me, worthless girl, and don’t try to hide the truth.People, people, servants, madam, de vils laquais have seen you, as you went in there, to your—’"
"埃琳娜的脸涨得通红，她的眼睛闪耀着光芒。","Elena was crimson, her eyes were blazing."
"“我没什么要隐瞒的。”她义正言辞地说，“是的，我去过那栋房子。”","‘I have no need to hide anything,’ she declared.‘Yes, I have visited that house.’"
"“很好！你听见了吗，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜？那想必你清楚是谁住在那里吧？”","‘Exactly!Do you hear, do you hear, Anna Vassilyevna?And you know, I presume, who lives there?’"
"“是的，我知道，我的丈夫。”","‘Yes, I know; my husband.’"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇顿时目瞪口呆。","Nikolai Artemyevitch’s eyes were starting out of his head."
"“你的——”","‘Your—’"
"“我的丈夫，”埃琳娜重复道，“我已经跟德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇·因萨罗夫结婚了。”","‘My husband,’ repeated Elena; ‘I am married to Dmitri Nikanorovitch Insarov.’"
"“你？结婚了？”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜用尽力气也只能从嘴里吐出这几个字。","‘You?—married?’—was all Anna Vassilyevna could articulate."
"“是的，母亲……请原谅我。两个星期之前，我们秘密地结婚了。”","‘Yes, mamma….Forgive me.A fortnight ago, we were secretly married.’"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜跌坐回椅子里，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇往后退了两步。","Anna Vassilyevna fell back in her chair; Nikolai Artemyevitch stepped two paces back."
"“结婚！跟那个流浪汉，那个黑山佬！没有父母之命，媒妁之言，贵族出身的尼古拉·斯塔霍夫的女儿竟然嫁给了一个什么都不是的流浪汉！你以为我会对这件事置之不理，我不会去诉之于法律，我会容忍你——你——你会被送到修道院里去，而他，他要被关进监狱，去当苦力！安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜，快告诉她，你收回她的继承权！”","‘Married!To that vagrant, that Montenegrin!the daughter of Nikolai Stahov of the higher nobility married to a vagrant, a nobody, without her parents’ sanction!And you imagine I shall let the matter rest, that I shall not make a complaint, that I will allow you—that you—that—To the nunnery with you, and he shall go to prison, to hard labour!Anna Vassilyevna, inform her at once that you will cut off her inheritance!’"
"“尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇，看在上帝的份上。”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜悲惨地喊道。","‘Nikolai Artemyevitch, for God’s sake,’ moaned Anna Vassilyevna."
"“这件事是怎么发生的？在什么时候发生的？谁给你们主持的婚礼？在哪里？如何进行的？上帝啊！我们的朋友们会怎么想，其他人会怎么说这件事啊！还有你，你这个不要脸的伪君子，在做出了这样的事之后还有脸跟你父母住在一起！你就不怕——不怕老天的报应吗？”","‘And when and how was this done?Who married you?where? how?Good God!what will all our friends think, what will the world say!And you, shameless hypocrite, could go on living under your parents’ roof after such an act!Had you no fear of—the wrath of heaven?’"
"“父亲，”埃琳娜说（虽然她的身体不住地颤抖，但是声音却那么坚定），“您想怎么处罚我都行，但是请您不要责备我无耻和虚伪。我本不想这样——我本不想给您带来痛苦，但我原本打算过几天就告诉您的，因为我准备离开了——和我的丈夫一起——我们下周就走。”","‘Papa’ said Elena (she was trembling from head to foot but her voice was steady), ‘you are at liberty to do with me as you please, but you need not accuse me of shamelessness, and hypocrisy.I did not want—to give you pain before, but I should have had to tell you all myself in a few days, because we are going away—my husband and I—from here next week.’"
"“走？去哪儿？”","‘Going away?Where to?’"
"“去他的祖国，去保加利亚。”","‘To his own country, to Bulgaria.’"
"“去土耳其人那儿！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜大声喊道，然后晕了过去。","‘To the Turks!’ cried Anna Vassilyevna and fell into a swoon."
"埃琳娜跑到她母亲身边。","Elena ran to her mother."
"“滚开！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇拉住他女儿的胳膊，大声吼道，“滚！不知廉耻的丫头！”","‘Away!’ clamoured Nikolai Artemyevitch, seizing his daughter by the arm, ‘away, unworthy girl!’"
"然而，就在这个时候，房间的门打开了，一张面色惨白的脸出现在门口，那脸上有一双闪闪发亮的眼睛：那正是舒宾。","But at that instant the door of the room opened, and a pale face with glittering eyes appeared: it was the face of Shubin."
"“尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇！”他用最大的声音叫道，“奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂亚诺夫娜来了，她叫您过去！”","‘Nikolai Artemyevitch!’ he shouted at the top of his voice, ‘Augustina Christianovna is here and is asking for you!’"
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇怒气冲天地转过身去，恐吓似的向舒宾挥了挥拳。他稍稍站定，就向屋外跑去。","Nikolai Artemyevitch turned round infuriated, threatening Shubin with his fist; he stood still a minute and rapidly went out of the room."
"埃琳娜坐倒在她的母亲的脚边，抱住她的膝盖。","Elena fell at her mother’s feet and embraced her knees."
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇正躺在床上。他穿了一件系着大纽扣的无领衬衫，正好将他那肥厚的脖子裹了起来，衬衫的那些宽大的褶皱在他那仿佛女人般的胸部上铺开，能看到他佩戴的柏木十字架和护身符。他硕大的肢体隐藏在轻薄的被单之下。蜡烛在床边的小桌上发出昏黄的光亮，旁边放着一杯克瓦斯啤酒。舒宾无精打采地坐在尤瓦·伊万诺维奇的脚头。","Uvar Ivanovitch was lying on his bed.A shirt without a collar, fastened with a heavy stud enfolded his thick neck and fell in full flowing folds over the almost feminine contours of his chest, leaving visible a large cypress-wood cross and an amulet.His ample limbs were covered with the lightest bedclothes.On the little table by the bedside a candle was burning dimly beside a jug of kvas, and on the bed at Uvar ivanovitch’s feet was sitting Shubin in a dejected pose."
"“的确，”他若有所思地说道，“她已经结婚了，而且已经准备好要离开了。您的侄儿正为了这个家的利益嚎啕大叫，他为了不让人听见，把自己锁在他妻子的房间，但是现在不光是女仆和男仆们，就连马夫们都能听得一清二楚！现在，他正发狂似的破口大骂，差点儿就要给我一拳，摆着父亲的架子谩骂着，跟只极度头痛的熊一样暴躁，但是，这都不重要。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜伤心欲绝，但是跟女儿暗自结婚相比，她更难过的是女儿即将离她远去。”","‘Yes,’ he was saying meditatively, ’she is married and getting ready to go away.Your nephew was bawling and shouting for the benefit of the whole house; he had shut himself up for greater privacy in his wife’s bedroom, but not merely the maids and the footmen, the coachman even could hear it all!Now he’s just tearing and raving round; he all but gave me a thrashing, he’s bringing a father’s curse on the scene now, as cross as a bear with a sore head; but that’s of no importance.Anna Vassilyevna’s crushed, but she’s much more brokenhearted at her daughter leaving her than at her marriage.’"
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇弹了弹手指。","Uvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers."
"“作为一个母亲，”他评论说，“这是肯定的。”","‘A mother,’ he commented, ‘to be sure.’"
"“您的侄儿，”舒宾接着说，“他声称要到大主教、总督和总理大臣那去控告他们，可这些最后还是要以她的离开而告终。没人想置自己的亲生女儿于死地！他发过脾气以后，心情会慢慢平复的。”","‘Your nephew,’ resumed Shubin, ‘threatens to lodge a complaint with the Metropolitan and the General-Governor and the Minister, but it will end by her going.A happy thought to ruin his own daughter!He’ll crow a little and then lower his colours.’"
"“他们没有资格。”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇说道，然后一口把杯子里的克瓦斯啤酒喝完了。","‘They’d no right,’ observed Uvar Ivanovitch, and he drank out of the jug."
"“的确如此。但是，想想吧，一场批评、指责、闲言碎语、蜚短流长的风暴就要在莫斯科掀起来了。她对此毫无畏惧……而且，她一点儿都没把这些放在心上。她就要离开这里了……想到她要去的地方就让人心惊胆战——那么遥远，那么荒凉！未来等着她的是什么啊？我仿佛看见了她在一场零下三十度的暴风雪之中从驿站离开，远赴他乡。她要远离她的祖国，远离她的亲友，但是我理解她为什么这么做。她在这里还放下了哪些人呢？她碰到过哪些人呢？库尔纳托夫斯基和别尔谢涅夫，还有我们这一群人，这些都是和她关系最好的人。这还能有什么放不下的？有一件事情很糟糕。据说她的丈夫——那个魔鬼，这个名字刺得我喉咙痛！因萨罗夫，据说他在咳血，这可是个不好的预兆。我前几天见过他，他的脸——就像布鲁特斯的一样。你知道布鲁特斯是谁吗，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇？”","‘To be sure.But what a storm of criticism, gossip, and comments will be raised in Moscow!She’s not afraid of them….Besides she’s above them.She’s going away… and it’s awful to think where she’s going—to such a distance, such a wilderness!What future awaits her there?I seem to see her setting off from a posting station in a snow-storm with thirty degrees of frost.She’s leaving her country, and her people; but I understand her doing it.Whom is she leaving here behind her?What people has she seen?Kurnatovsky and Bersenyev and our humble selves; and these are the best she’s seen.What is there to regret about it?One thing’s bad; I’m told her husband—the devil, how that word sticks in my throat!—Insarov, I’m told, is spitting blood; that’s a bad lookout.I saw him the other day: his face—you could model Brutus from it straight off.Do you know who Brutus was, Uvar Ivanovitch?’"
"“我上哪里知道去？肯定是一个男人。”","‘What is there to know? a man to be sure.’"
"“说的没错，他确实是个‘男人’。他有着一张完美的面孔，但是他的身体不好，非常不好。”","‘Precisely so: he was a “man.”Yes he’s a wonderful face, but unhealthy, very unhealthy.’"
"“到了战场上……这就没什么区别了。”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇说道。","‘For fighting… it makes no difference,’ observed Uvar Ivanovitch."
"“到了战场上的确是没什么区别了。您今天可是说得相当公正，但是要是生活的话，那可是差之千里啊。而且，你看，她是想要跟他生活上一段时间的。”","‘For fighting it makes no difference, certainly; you are pleased to express yourself with great justice to-day; but for living it makes all the difference.And you see she wants to live with him a little while.’"
"“年轻人的事就是这样。”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇回答道。","‘A youthful affair,’ responded Uvar Ivanovitch."
"“是啊，年轻人的事情，光荣的，勇敢的。死亡、生命、冲突、失败、胜利、爱情、自由、祖国……仁慈的上帝啊，请把这些赐予我们所有人吧！这跟你陷入一个齐脖深的泥沼然后装作若无其事是完全不一样的，可事实上确实没什么差别。这就像你拨弄琴弦，想弹出一个高音，会有两个结果，要不是你把这个音弹出来了，要不就是弦断了！”","‘Yes, a youthful, glorious, bold affair.Death, life, conflict, defeat, triumph, love, freedom, country….Good God, grant as much to all of us!That’s a very different thing from sitting up to one’s neck in a bog, and pretending it’s all the same to you, when in fact it really is all the same.While there—the strings are tuned to the highest pitch, to play to all the world or to break!’"
"舒宾把头深深地埋在胸口。","Shubin’s head sank on to his breast."
"“的确，”在一段沉默后，他接着说道，“因萨罗夫跟她很相配。但是，毫无道理可言啊！没人配得上她……因萨罗夫……因萨罗夫……装出来的谦虚有什么用？我们承认他是一个好人，他自力更生，但是目前为止，他并不比我们这些有罪的可怜人多做了些什么。难道我们就这么一钱不值吗？我真的一无是处吗，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇？难道上帝在各方面都苛责我？他没有赋予我任何的才干、能力吗？谁知道呢，也许，帕维尔·舒宾这个名字将来也会名声大震呢？您看您桌上的那枚法新铜币。天知道哪一天，也许一百年后的后人会带着崇敬之情把它做成一尊帕维尔·舒宾的肖像！”","‘Yes,’ he resumed, after a prolonged silence, ‘Insarov deserves her.What nonsense, though!No one deserves her…Insarov…Insarov … What’s the use of pretended modesty?We’ll own he’s a fine fellow, he stands on his own feet, though up to the present he has done no more than we poor sinners; and are we such absolutely worthless dirt?Am I such dirt, Uvar Ivanovitch?Has God been hard on me in every way?Has He given me no talents, no abilities?Who knows, perhaps, the name of Pavel Shubin will in time be a great name?You see that bronze farthing there lying on your table.Who knows; some day, perhaps in a century, that bronze will go to a statue of Pavel Shubin, raised in his honour by a grateful posterity!’"
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇用胳膊支撑起身体，盯着这个狂热的艺术家。","Uvar Ivanovitch leaned on his elbow and stared at the enthusiastic artist."
"“那是很久之后的事了，”他以惯常的姿势最后说道，“我们在说别人，你怎么扯到你自己身上了？”","‘That’s a long way off,’ he said at last with his usual gesture; ‘we’re speaking of other people, why bring in yourself?’"
"“哦！俄国的伟大哲学家！”舒宾朗声说，“您说的每一句话跟黄金一样价值连城，应该给您立一座塑像，而不是我，我呢，将亲自来做这件事。那里，当您用这个姿势躺在这里，没人知道它蕴涵着什么，是懒惰还是力量！我要将您的这个形象做成铜雕像。您客观公正地指出了我的自我主义和我的虚荣！是的！是的！谈论某个个体是毫无意义的，这只是毫无意义的自夸。我们这里还没有一个人，没人有和你一样的眼光。没有人——不管是小人物，斤斤计较的人，哈姆雷特之流的人，自我感觉良好的人，还是愚蠢的人，不知道天高地厚的人，也或者是一些只会说大话的人和一些自吹自擂的家伙。抑或，还有这样的人：他们对自己了解得极端透彻，感觉非常敏感，不断地告诉自己‘那就是我所感觉到的，那就是我所想的。’这是件既有用又合理的事情。不，如果我们身边只有这些明智的人，那个女孩儿，那个高尚的灵魂就不会离我们而去，就不会像鱼儿入水那样溜走。这到底是为什么，尤瓦·伊万诺维奇？我们的时代何时才能来临？我们身边什么时候才能出现那样有资格的人呢？","‘O great philosopher of the Russian world!’ cried Shubin, ‘every word of yours is worth its weight in gold, and it’s not to me but to you a statue ought to be raised, and I would undertake it.There, as you are lying now, in that pose; one doesn’t know which is uppermost in it, sloth or strength!That’s how I would cast you in bronze.You aimed a just reproach at my egoism and vanity!Yes! yes! it’s useless talking of one’s-self; it’s useless bragging.We have no one yet, no men, look where you will.Everywhere—either small fry, nibblers, Hamlets on a small scale, self-absorbed, or darkness and subterranean chaos, or idle babblers and wooden sticks.Or else they are like this: they study themselves to the most shameful detail, and are for ever feeling the pulse of every sensation and reporting to themselves: “That’s what I feel, that’s what I think.”A useful, rational occupation!No, if we only had some sensible men among us, that girl, that delicate soul, would not have run away from us, would not have slipped off like a fish to the water!What’s the meaning of it, Uvar Ivanovitch?When will our time come?When will men be born among us?’"
"“我们需要时间，”尤瓦·伊万诺维奇回答道，“他们会出现的——”","‘Give us time,’ answered Uvar Ivanovitch; ‘they will be—’"
"“他们会出现？我亲爱祖国的大地啊！你有着无与伦比的力量！您说了，他们会出现的。您看，我要把您所说的记录下来。但是您为什么要熄灭蜡烛呢？”","‘They will be?soil of our country!force of the black earth!thou hast said: they will be.Look, I will write down your words.But why are you putting out the candle?’"
"“我想休息了，再见。”","‘I’m going to sleep; good-bye.’"
"第三十一章","CHAPTER XXXI"
"舒宾所言非虚。埃琳娜意外结婚的消息差点儿让安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜魂归天国。她瘫倒在床上。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇坚持不让她接受女儿的探望。他似乎十分喜欢显示出自己身为一家之主的气魄。他在家中暴跳如雷，对仆人大吼大叫，而且还不停地说：“我要让你们知道，我不是好惹的，你们会知道的，等着瞧吧！”他在家的时候，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜见不着埃琳娜，只能满足于卓娅的陪伴。卓尽心尽力地守候在她的旁边，但心里却在思考：“居然看上了这个因萨罗夫——那舍掉了谁呢？”但是只要尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇一出门（他时常出门，因为奥古斯丁娜真的回来了），埃琳娜便去看望她的母亲。她的母亲时常眼含热泪、一言不发地盯着她。","Shubin had spoken truly.The unexpected news of Elena’s marriage nearly killed Anna Vassilyevna.She took to her bed.Nikolai Artemyevitch insisted on her not admitting her daughter to her presence; he seemed to be enjoying the opportunity of showing himself in the fullest sense the master of the house, with all the authority of the head of the family; he made an incessant uproar in the household, storming at the servants, and constantly saying: ‘I will show you who I am, I will let you know—you wait a little!’While he was in the house, Anna Vassilyevna did not see Elena, and had to be content with Zoya, who waited on her very devotedly, but kept thinking to herself: ‘Diesen Insarof vorziehen—und wem?’But directly Nikolai Artemyevitch went out—and that happened pretty often, Augustina Christianovna had come back in sober earnest—Elena went to her mother, and a long time her mother gazed at her in silence and in tears."
"这种无声的责备，比其他任何一种责备更让埃琳娜感到痛彻心扉，在那一刻她感到的并不是悔恨，而是一种跟悔恨相似的、深深的、无尽的怜惜。","This dumb reproach, more deeply than any other, cut Elena to the heart; at such moments she felt, not remorse, but a deep, boundless pity akin to remorse."
"“母亲，我亲爱的母亲！”她一遍又一遍地重复着，亲吻着她的手，“我该怎么做呢？我没有错，我爱他，无论如何我都会这么做。要怪就只能怪命运，是命运把我和父亲不喜欢的人安排在了一起，并且叫他带我离你而去。”","‘Mamma, dear mamma!’ she would repeat, kissing her hands; ‘what was I to do?I’m not to blame, I loved him, I could not have acted differently.Throw the blame on fate for throwing me with a man whom papa doesn’t like, and who is taking me away from you.’"
"“哎！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜打断了她，“不要让我想起这件事。我一想到你要走，我的心就像要炸掉一样！”","‘Ah!’ Anna Vassilyevna cut her short, ‘don’t remind me of that.When I think where you mean to go, my heart is ready to burst!’"
"“亲爱的母亲，”埃琳娜说，“您放心吧，至少，事情还没有到无法挽回的地步，我还有可能已经死去了呢。”","‘Dear mamma,’ answered Elena, ‘be comforted; at least, it might have been worse; I might have died.’"
"“但是，尽管如此，我也别指望能再见到你了。你要么就是在一个茅草房里终此一生，”在安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的眼里，保加利亚和西伯利亚湿地一样荒凉，“要么就是我死于这无尽的离愁——”","‘But, as it is, I don’t expect to see you again.Either you will end your days there in a tent somewhere’—Anna Vassilyevna pictured Bulgaria as something after the nature of the Siberian swamps,—‘or I shall not survive the separation—’"
"“不要这样说，我最亲爱的母亲，我们还会再见的，上帝保佑。保加利亚也有跟这里一样的城镇。”","‘Don’t say that, mamma dearest, we shall see each other again, please God.There are towns in Bulgaria just as there are here.’"
"“那里哪儿有什么城镇！现在那里是战乱之地。在我看来，不论你去哪里，到处都会有冒着火的大炮……你很快就要启程吗？”","‘Fine towns there, indeed!There is war going on there now; wherever you go, I suppose they are firing cannons off all the while…Are you meaning to set off soon?’"
"“很快……只要父亲。他打算去控告我们，他恐吓着要把我们拆散。”","’Soon… if only papa.He means to appeal to the authorities; he threatens to separate us.’"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜向远处望去。","Anna Vassilyevna turned her eyes heavenwards."
"“不，列诺奇卡，他不会这样做的。就我而言，一开始，我是无论如何不会同意这桩婚事的。我宁可先死掉。但是如今木已成舟，我绝不会让我的女儿蒙羞。”","‘No, Lenotchka, he will not do that.I would not myself have consented to this marriage.I would have died first; but what’s done can’t be undone, and I will not let my daughter be disgraced.’"
"就这样过了几天。一天晚上，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜终于鼓起勇气，把自己和丈夫单独锁在卧室里。整个房子安静得任何一点儿声响都能听到。一开始，一点儿动静也没有，接着尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的声音开始响起，然后又有吵架的声音，叫喊声越来越大，甚至连呻吟声都能听见……舒宾、卓娅和侍女们商量着打算冲进去劝架，但是吵架声渐渐平息了下来，变成了安静的谈话声，最后连谈话声也没有了。只能听见时不时传来的一两声抽泣，然后，这些动静也消失了。有钥匙叮叮当当的声音响了起来，然后是书桌抽屉被拉开的声音……门开了，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇出现在门口。他用严厉的目光扫过他面前的人，然后就去俱乐部了。同时，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜把埃琳娜叫到跟前，紧紧地抱住她，苦涩的泪水划过她的脸颊，她说道：","So passed a few days.At last Anna Vassilyevna plucked up her courage, and one evening she shut herself up alone with her husband in her room.The whole house was hushed to catch every sound.At first nothing was to be heard; then Nikolai Artemyevitch’s voice began to tune up, then a quarrel broke out, shouts were raised, even groans were discerned….Already Shubin was plotting with the maids and Zoya to rush in to the rescue; but the uproar in the bedroom began by degrees to grow less, passed into quiet talk, and ceased.Only from time to time a faint sob was to be heard, and then those, too, were still.There was the jingling of keys, the creak of a bureau being unfastened….The door was opened, and Nikolai Artemyevitch appeared.He looked surlily at every one who met him, and went out to the club; while Anna Vassilyevna sent for Elena, embraced her warmly, and, with bitter tears flowing down her cheeks, she said:"
"“所有的事情都安排好了，他不会把这件事说出去，现在没有任何东西能阻挡你的去路——阻挡你抛弃我们。”","‘Everything is settled, he will not make a scandal, and there is nothing now to hinder you from going—from abandoning us.’"
"“您允许德米特里过来向您表示感谢吗？”待到她的母亲情绪稳定一些之后，埃琳娜乞求她。","‘You will let Dmitri come to thank you?’Elena begged her mother, as soon as the latter had been restored a little."
"“等等，亲爱的，我现在还无法从容面对那个把你从我身边带走的人。你们离开之前我们还有时间。”","‘Wait a little, my darling, I cannot bear yet to see the man who has come between us.We shall have time before you go.’"
"“我们离开之前。”埃琳娜痛苦地重复着。","‘Before we go,’ repeated Elena mournfully."
"尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇同意“不把这件事捅出去”，但是安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜没有告诉她的女儿为此她付出了怎样的代价。她没有告诉女儿，她答应帮他付清所有的欠款，还当即给了他一千卢布。除此之外，他还斩钉截铁地对安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜表示，他不会见那个被他称为“黑山种”的因萨罗夫。他走进俱乐部后毫无缘由地开始向自己玩牌的对家，一个早就退伍的工兵部队的将军，谈起埃琳娜的婚事。“您已经听说了，”他漫不经心地说道，“我那受过高等教育的女儿已经跑去跟一个大学生结婚了。”将军透过眼镜看了他一眼，“嗯”了一声，然后问他要玩多大的。","Nikolai Artemyevitch had consented ‘not to make a scandal,’ but Anna Vassilyevna did not tell her daughter what a price he had put on his consent.She did not tell her that she had promised to pay all his debts, and had given him a thousand roubles down on the spot.Moreover, he had declared decisively to Anna Vassilyevna that he had no wish to meet Insarov, whom he persisted in calling ‘the Montenegrin vagrant,’ and when he got to the club, he began, quite without occasion, talking of Elena’s marriage, to his partner at cards, a retired general of engineers.‘You have heard,’ he observed with a show of carelessness, ’my daughter, through the higher education, has gone and married a student.‘The general looked at him through his spectacles, muttered, ’H’m!’ and asked him what stakes would he play for."
"第三十二章","CHAPTER XXXII"
"离开的日子近了。十一月份已经过去了，到了最晚必须离开的时候了。因萨罗夫很早以前就做好了离开的准备，他已经迫不及待地要离开莫斯科了。医生也催促他尽早离开。“你需要一个温暖的气候，”医生对他说，“你的身体在这里很难好起来。”埃琳娜也是焦急万分，她非常担心因萨罗夫那惨白的脸色和虚弱的身体。他那变了形的面孔时常会让她产生不可抑制的恐惧。她在自己父母家中的境况也让她无法继续心安理得地住下去。母亲总是像悼念死者一样在她面前哭得死去活来，而父亲对她则是熟视无睹，即将到来的分离也让他觉得很心痛，但是他认为作为一个被冒犯的父亲就应该隐藏自己的情感和脆弱。安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜最终表示想要见一见因萨罗夫。他悄悄地从后楼梯上去见她。当他走进她的房间，她很长时间一句话也说不出来，她甚至无法让自己看他一眼。他在她旁边的椅子上坐了下来，满怀尊敬地静静等待着她说第一句话。埃琳娜坐在母亲身边，紧紧地握住母亲的手。终于，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜抬起头说：“上帝将对你进行裁决，德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇。”——她的话就此戛然而止，本来有很多责备的话也吞进了肚子里。“咦，你生病了，”她大声说道，“埃琳娜，你的丈夫生病了！”","The day of departure drew near.November was already over; the latest date for starting had come.Insarov had long ago made his preparations, and was burning with anxiety to get out of Moscow as soon as possible.And the doctor was urging him on.‘You need a warm climate,’ he told him; ‘you will not get well here.’Elena, too, was fretting with impatience; she was worried by Insarov’s pallor, and his emaciation.She often looked with involuntary terror at his changed face.Her position in her parents’ house had become insupportable.Her mother mourned over her, as over the dead, while her father treated her with contemptuous coldness; the approaching separation secretly pained him too, but he regarded it as his duty—the duty of an offended father—to disguise his feelings, his weakness.Anna Vassilyevna at last expressed a wish to see Insarov.He was taken up to her secretly by the back stairs.After he had entered her room, for a long time she could not speak to him, she could not even bring herself to look at him; he sat down near her chair, and waited, with quiet respectfulness, for her first word.Elena sat down close, and held her mother’s hand in hers.At last Anna Vassilyevna raised her eyes, saying: ‘God is your judge, Dmitri Nikanorovitch’—she stopped short: the reproaches died away on her lips.’Why, you are ill,‘ she cried: ’Elena, your husband’s ill!’"
"“我前一阵子生了一场大病，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜，”因萨罗夫回答道，“即使是现在，我也没有完全恢复，但是我希望祖国的水土能让我彻底地好起来。”","‘I have been unwell, Anna Vassilyevna,’ answered Insarov; ‘and even now I am not quite strong yet: but I hope my native air will make me perfectly well again.’"
"“啊——保加利亚！”安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜嘟囔着，暗自想：“上帝啊，一个快要死去的保加利亚人，声音空洞地像是从鼓里传出来的一样，眼窝深陷，瘦骨嶙峋，衣服松松垮垮地挂在肩上，面色蜡黄。她竟然是他的妻子——她爱他——这肯定是一场噩梦。但是——”她立马让自己停下来，说，“德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇，你一定，一定要走吗？”","‘Ah—Bulgaria!’ murmured Anna Vassilyevna, and she thought: ‘Good God, a Bulgarian, and dying; a voice as hollow as a drum; and eyes like saucers, a perfect skeleton; his coat hanging loose on his shoulders, his face as yellow as a guinea, and she’s his wife—she loves him—it must be a bad dream.But—’ she checked herself at once: ‘Dmitri Nikanorovitch,’ she said, ‘are you absolutely, absolutely bound to go away?’"
"“一定要走，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜。”","‘Absolutely, Anna Vassilyevna.’"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜看着他。","Anna Vassilyevna looked at him."
"“啊，德米特里·尼卡诺罗维奇，希望上帝保佑你不会受到我如今所受的痛苦。但是你要向我保证，你一定会好好地照顾她——爱她。在我的有生之年，你们绝不会为贫穷所累！”","‘Ah, Dmitri Nikanorovitch, God grant you never have to go through what I am going through now.But you will promise me to take care of her—to love her.You will not have to face poverty while I am living!’"
"泪水让她哽咽了。她张开了双臂，埃琳娜和因萨罗夫投入了她的怀抱。","Tears choked her voice.She opened her arms, and Elena and Insarov flung themselves into her embrace."
"离开的日子终于到来了。根据安排，埃琳娜要在家跟父母道别，然后从因萨罗夫的公寓开始他们的旅程。出发的时间定在十二点整。在约定出发前的十五分钟，别尔谢涅夫来了。他本来以为会在因萨罗夫那里看到因萨罗夫的同胞来跟他告别，但是他们早已经离开了，包括读者知道的那两个颇为神秘的人物（他们参加了因萨罗夫的婚礼）。裁缝对着这位“善良的绅士”鞠了一躬。他喝了很多酒，也许是因为悲伤，但也可能是因为得到家具的喜悦，他的妻子赶紧过来把他带走了。房间里的所有东西都准备妥当了。地板上放着一只拿绳子系好了的皮箱。别尔谢涅夫陷入沉思，许多回忆喷涌而出。","The fatal day had come at last.It had been arranged that Elena should say good-bye to her parents at home, and should start on the journey from Insarov’s lodgings.The departure was fixed for twelve o’clock.About a quarter of an hour before the appointed time Bersenyev arrived.He had expected to find Insarov’s compatriots at his lodgings, anxious to see him off; but they had already gone before; and with them the two mysterious persons known to the reader (they had been witnesses at Insarov’s wedding).The tailor met the ’kind gentlemen’ with a bow; he, presumably, to drown his grief, but possibly to celebrate his delight at getting the furniture, had been drinking heavily; his wife soon led him away.In the room everything was by this time ready; a trunk, tied up with cord, stood on the floor.Bersenyev sank into thought: many memories came rushing upon him."
"十二点的钟声早已敲响，马夫也已经弄好了马匹，但是那对“新人”始终没有出现。最后，伴随着急促的下楼声，埃琳娜被因萨罗夫和舒宾护送着走了出来。埃琳娜的眼睛通红，她离开的时候母亲正不省人事地躺着。分离的场面特别痛苦。埃琳娜已经有一个多星期没有见过别尔谢涅夫了。这段时间以来，他很少去斯塔霍夫家。她没有想到能见到他，叫道：“是你！谢谢你！”她过去搂住他的脖子，因萨罗夫也走过去，抱住了他。接下来就是一段伤感的沉默。这三个人互相之间能说点儿什么呢？他们的心里有何感触？舒宾发现有必要用几句轻描淡写岔开一切伤感。","Twelve o’clock had long ago struck; and the driver had already brought round the horses, but the ‘young people’ still did not appear.At last hurrying steps were heard on the stairs, and Elena came out escorted by Insarov and Shubin.Elena’s eyes were red; she had left her mother lying unconscious; the parting had been terrible.Elena had not seen Bersenyev for more than a week: he had been seldom of late at the Stahovs’.She had not expected to meet him; and crying, ‘You!thank you!’ she threw herself on his neck; Insarov, too, embraced him.A painful silence followed.What could these three say to one another?what were they feeling in their hearts?Shubin realised the necessity of cutting short everything painful with light words."
"“我们这三重奏又凑到一起了，”他说道，“这是最后一次了，让我们服从命运的安排，感恩地谈论过去吧，以上帝的名义，让我们开始新的生活！上帝保佑，祝你们一路顺风。”他张口吟唱，但又马上停了下来。他突然感到羞愧和尴尬。在死人躺着的地方唱歌是罪大恶极的。在那一刻的那个屋子里，那一段他所说的过往，那一段他们相遇相识的过往正在死去。它的死去为的是在新的生活中重生——这点不用怀疑——但它毕竟死了。","‘Our trio has come together again,’ he began, ‘for the last time.Let us submit to the decrees of fate; speak of the past with kindness; and in God’s name go forward to the new life!In God’s name, on our distant way,’ he began to hum, and stopped short.He felt suddenly ashamed and awkward.It is a sin to sing where the dead are lying: and at that instant, in that room, the past of which he had spoken was dying, the past of the people met together in it.It was dying to be born again in a new life—doubtless—still it was death."
"“走吧，埃琳娜，”因萨罗夫对着他的妻子说道，“我想一切都准备好了。该交的钱都交了，该打包的也已经打包了。一切都已经准备就绪，只需要把这个箱子提下去。”他把房东叫了过来。","‘Come, Elena,’ began Insarov, turning to his wife, ‘I think everything is done?Everything paid, and everything packed.There’s nothing more except to take the box down.’He called his landlord."
"裁缝和他的妻子、女儿一起走进了房间。他有些晕眩地听完因萨罗夫的吩咐，便把皮箱扛到肩上，急急忙忙向楼下走去。他的靴子把楼板踩得咚咚直响。","The tailor came into the room, together with his wife and daughter.He listened, slightly reeling, to Insarov’s instructions, dragged the box up on to his shoulders, and ran quickly down the staircases, tramping heavily with his boots."
"“现在，按照俄罗斯的习俗，我们应该坐下来。”因萨罗夫说道。","‘Now, after the Russian custom, we must sit down,’ observed Insarov."
"他们都坐了下来。别尔谢涅夫坐到那个老旧的沙发上，埃琳娜坐在他旁边，女房东和她的女儿在门廊蹲着。所有人都沉默。大家都勉为其难地干笑着。每个人都想在这离别时候说些什么，但每个人（当然，这不包括女房东和她的女儿，她们只是蹲在那东看看西瞧瞧）都感到在这种时刻只能说些平凡无奇的话语，任何重要的、有道理的甚至是饱含深情的话语都不合时宜，简直是不诚恳。因萨罗夫第一个站了起来，开始在胸前划十字。“再见了，我们的小房子！”他大声说道。","They all sat down; Bersenyev seated himself on the old sofa, Elena sat next him; the landlady and her daughter squatted in the doorway.All were silent; all smiled constrainedly, though no one knew why he was smiling; each of them wanted to say something at parting, and each (except, of course, the landlady and her daughter, they were simply rolling their eyes) felt that at such moments it is only permissible to utter common-places, that any word of importance, of sense, or even of deep feeling, would be somehow out of place, almost insincere.Insarov was the first to get up, and he began crossing himself.‘Farewell, our little room!’ he cried."
"于是大家开始吻别。大声却冰冷的吻别，美好的祝愿——只说了一半——祝愿旅途的顺利，许诺写信联系，最后是几乎让人窒息的永别。","Then came kisses, the sounding but cold kisses of leave-taking, good wishes—half expressed—for the journey, promises to write, the last, half-smothered words of farewell."
"泪流满面的埃琳娜已经在雪橇上坐好了。因萨罗夫细心地用毛毯盖住了她的双腿。人们都站在台阶前面：舒宾，别尔谢涅夫，房东，他的妻子和依然带着头巾的女儿，守门人和一个身穿花纹睡袍的工人。突然，由高大健壮的骏马拉着的一辆豪华雪橇跑进了院子，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇从雪橇上跳下来，拍了拍大衣领上的雪花。","Elena, all in tears, had already taken her seat in the sledge; Insarov had carefully wrapped her feet up in a rug; Shubin, Bersenyev, the landlord, his wife, the little daughter, with the inevitable kerchief on her head, the doorkeeper, a workman in a striped bedgown, were all standing on the steps, when suddenly a splendid sledge, harnessed with spirited horses, flew into the courtyard, and from the sledge, shaking the snow off the collar of his cloak, leapt Nikolai Artemyevitch."
"“感谢上帝，我来得还不算太晚。”他大声说道，跑向他们的雪橇，“埃琳娜，请接受你父亲最后的祝福。”他一边说，一边低下腰，从长礼服的口袋中拿出一个丝绒布袋，里面放着一尊小圣像。他将它戴到埃琳娜的脖子上。她开始抽泣，亲吻他的手。与此同时，雪橇前座的马车夫拿出半瓶香槟和三只高脚杯。","‘I am not too late, thank God,’ he cried, running up to their sledge.‘Here, Elena, is our last parental benediction,’ he said, bending down under the hood, and taking from his pocket a little holy image, sewn in a velvet bag, he put it round her neck.She began to sob, and kiss his hands; and the coachman meantime pulled out of the forepart of the sledge a half bottle of champagne, and three glasses."
"“来吧！”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇说道——他的眼泪滴到大衣的獭皮领上——“让我们举杯——祝福你们旅途顺利——祝福你们——”他开始倒手中的香槟。他的手在发抖，泡沫从杯中溢出，飘落到雪地上。他自己拿起一杯，把另外两杯递给了埃琳娜和因萨罗夫，因萨罗夫这时坐在他的身边。“愿上帝保佑你们——”尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇开始说道，但却无法接着说下去。他一口气把酒喝完了，另外两人也把各自杯中的酒一饮而尽。“先生们，现在轮到你们了。”他对舒宾和别尔谢涅夫说道，但是就在那时，马夫催了催马。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇跑到雪橇旁边，“不要忘了我们，记得给我们写信。”他用那已经沙哑的嗓音说道。埃琳娜把头伸出马车，说道：“再见了，父亲、安德烈·彼得罗维奇、帕维尔·雅克夫利奇。别了，大家，别了，俄罗斯！”说着，她把头缩了回去，重新坐好。马夫挥舞了一下马鞭，吹了一声口哨，雪橇的滑板便在雪地上跑了起来，嘎吱作响。雪橇跑到门口的时候向右一拐，然后消失不见了。","‘Come!’ said Nikolai Artemyevitch—and his own tears were trickling on to the beaver collar of his cloak—‘we must drink to—good journey—good wishes—’ He began pouring out the champagne: his hands were shaking, the foam rose over the edge and fell on to the snow.He took one glass, and gave the other two to Elena and Insarov, who by now was seated beside him ‘God give you—’ began Nikolai Artemyevitch, and he could not go on: he drank off the wine; they, too, drank off their glasses.‘Now you should drink, gentlemen,’ he added, turning to Shubin and Bersenyev, but at that instant the driver started the horses.Nikolai Artemyevitch ran beside the sledge.‘Mind and write to us,’ he said in a broken voice.Elena put out her head, saying: ‘Good-bye, papa, Andrei Petrovitch, Pavel Yakovlitch, good-bye all, good-bye, Russia!’ and dropped back in her place.The driver flourished his whip, and gave a whistle; the sledge, its runners crunching on the snow, turned out of the gates to the right and disappeared."
"第三十三章","CHAPTER XXXIII"
"这是一个明媚的四月天。一条小划船在一片宽广的盐湖上滑行。这片盐湖将威尼斯与一个叫做“利多”的、由海沙淤积而成的狭长滩地相隔开。小划船随着船夫划动竹竿的节奏晃晃悠悠地向前行进着。在小船低低的遮篷下，埃琳娜和因萨罗夫正坐在软皮垫上。","It was a bright April day.On the broad lagoon which separates Venice from the narrow strip of accumulated sea sand, called the Lido, a gondola was gliding—swaying rhythmically at every push made by the gondolier as he leaned on the big pole.Under its low awning, on soft leather cushions, were sitting Elena and Insarov."
"从莫斯科出发以来，埃琳娜的面容没有太大的变化，但是脸上的神情不一样了，变得更加深邃、严肃，眼神看上去更加勇敢。她的身体也变得更加有线条，更加成熟，头发看起来也更浓郁，披散在白皙的额头和红扑扑的脸蛋上。只是她的双唇，在她不笑的时候会有一种不易察觉的轮廓，表现出一种被隐藏起来的、无时不在的担忧。与此恰恰相反的是，因萨罗夫脸上的表情依然不变，但是面容却发生了巨大的变化。他变得更加瘦削、苍老、惨白，还有些驼背。他不时会发出阵阵干咳声，深陷的眼睛焕发出一种异常的光彩。在从俄罗斯动身的路上，因萨罗夫在维也纳病倒了，他在床上躺了近两个月的时间，直到三月底才得以跟妻子一起前往威尼斯。他希望从那里取道扎拉，经塞尔维亚，再到保加利亚，因为其他的道路已经封闭了。战火已经蔓延到了多瑙河。英国和法国也已经向俄国宣战，所有的斯拉夫国家都被唤醒，准备起义。","Elena’s features had not changed much since the day of her departure from Moscow, but their expression was different; it was more thoughtful and more severe, and her eyes had a bolder look.Her whole figure had grown finer and more mature, and the hair seemed to lie in greater thickness and luxuriance along her white brow and her fresh cheeks.Only about her lips, when she was not smiling, a scarcely perceptible line showed the presence of a hidden constant anxiety.In Insarov’s face, on the contrary, the expression had remained the same, but his features had undergone a cruel change.He had grown thin, old, pale and bent; he was constantly coughing a short dry cough, and his sunken eyes shone with a strange brilliance.On the way from Russia, Insarov had lain ill for almost two months at Vienna, and only at the end of March had he been able to come with his wife to Venice; from there he was hoping to make his way through Zara to Servia, to Bulgaria; the other roads were closed.The war was now at its height about the Danube; England and France had declared war on Russia, all the Slavonic countries were roused and were preparing for an uprising."
"小游艇在利多的里岸停靠。埃琳娜和因萨罗夫沿着狭窄的、布满沙子的小道走着，道路两旁栽种着病怏怏的树苗（每年人们都会种些树，但每年这些树都会死掉），他们向着利多的外岸，向着海边走去。","The gondola put in to the inner shore of the Lido.Elena and Insarov walked along the narrow sandy road planted with sickly trees (every year they plant them and every year they die) to the outer shore of the Lido, to the sea."
"他们沿着海滩走着。亚得里亚海在他们面前卷起蓝色的、带着淤泥的海浪。海浪争先恐后地涌向岸边，泛起白色的泡沫，发出哗哗的声音，然后又退回去，在海滩上留下漂亮的贝壳和一片片海藻。","They walked along the beach.The Adriatic rolled its muddy-blue waves before them; they raced into the shore, foaming and hissing, and drew back again, leaving fine shells and fragments of seaweed on the beach."
"“这地方真荒凉啊！”埃琳娜说道，“你在这里可能会有些冷吧，但是我很好奇你为什么到这里来。”","‘What a desolate place!’ observed Elena ‘I’m afraid it’s too cold for you here, but I guess why you wanted to come here.’"
"“冷！”因萨罗夫嘴边立即浮现出一丝苦笑，说道，“我要是怕冷的话，怎么做个优秀的士兵。我到这里来……我这就告诉你是为什么。我望向大海的那一边，我感觉，虽然身处此地但我离我的祖国更近了。她就在那里，你知道吗，”他把手伸向东边，继续说道，“风就是从那边吹过来的。”","‘Cold!’ rejoined Insarov with a rapid and bitter smile, ‘I shall be a fine soldier, if I’m to be afraid of the cold.I came here…I will tell you why.I look across that sea, and I feel as though here, I am nearer my country.It is there, you know,’ he added, stretching out his hand to the East, ‘the wind blows from there.’"
"“这风能吹来你所期盼的那条船吗？”埃琳娜说，“看，那里有只白色的风帆，那是吗？”","‘Will not this wind bring the ship you are expecting?’ said Elena.’See, there is a white sail, is not that it?’"
"因萨罗夫顺着埃琳娜所指的方向，向大海远处看去。","Insarov gazed seaward into the distance to where Elena was pointing."
"“伦迪奇许诺过，一个星期内为我们安排好所有的事情，”他说，“我想，我们可以信任他……你听说过吗，埃琳娜，”他突然激动地说道，“据说穷困的达尔马提亚渔民献出了他们的铅块——你知道，那些铅块跟渔网一块撒入海里，是用来坠网的——来制造子弹！他们没钱，仅仅依靠捕鱼为生，但是却心甘情愿地拿出仅有的财产，现在他们就只能饿肚子了。多么伟大的民族！”","‘Renditch promised to arrange everything for us within a week,’ he said, ‘we can rely on him, I think….Did you hear, Elena,’ he added with sudden animation, ‘they say the poor Dalmatian fishermen have sacrificed their dredging weights—you know the leads they weigh their nets with for letting them down to the bottom—to make bullets!They have no money, they only just live by fishing; but they have joyfully given up their last property, and now are starving.What a nation!’"
"“注意了！”一个傲慢的声音从后面传来。随之而来的是疾驰的马蹄声。一个身穿灰色短军装，带着绿色帽子的奥地利军官骑在马上，从他们的身边飞驰而过——他俩差点儿没有躲开。","‘Aufgepasst!’ shouted a haughty voice behind them.The heavy thud of horse’s hoofs was heard, and an Austrian officer in a short grey tunic and a green cap galloped past them—they had scarcely time to get out of the way."
"因萨罗夫目光深沉地看着他的背影。","Insarov looked darkly after him."
"“别跟他一般见识，”埃琳娜说，“你知道，他们也没有其他可以骑马的地方了。”","‘He was not to blame,’ said Elena, ‘you know, they have no other place where they can ride.’"
"“不和他一般见识，”因萨罗夫说道，“但是，他的喊声、他的小胡子、他的军帽以及他整个装束都让我热血沸腾。我们回去吧。”","‘He was not to blame,’ answered Insarov ‘but he made my blood boil with his shout, his moustaches, his cap, his whole appearance.Let us go back.’"
"“好的，德米特里。我们回去吧。这里真的很冷。你在莫斯科生病之后没有好好调养自己，所以才在维也纳又病倒了。现在你要多加留心了。”","‘Yes, let us go back, Dmitri.It’s really cold here.You did not take care of yourself after your Moscow illness, and you had to pay for that at Vienna.Now you must be more cautious.’"
"因萨罗夫没有答话，但是一丝同样的苦笑又浮现在他的嘴边。","Insarov did not answer, but the same bitter smile passed over his lips."
"“如果你愿意的话，”埃琳娜说，“我们可以去大运河走走。你知道，我们来这里之后还没有好好地欣赏一下威尼斯呢。今晚我们就去剧院，我这里有两张包厢的票。听说有新剧上演。如果你愿意，我们今天可以好好放松一下，我们可以忘掉政治，忘掉战争，忘掉一切，只要记得我们还一起活着，一起呼吸，一起思考。我们永远都在一起——你愿意这样吗？”","‘If you like,’ Elena went on, ‘we will go along to the Canal Grande.We have not seen Venice properly, you know, all the while we have been here.And in the evening we are going to the theatre; I have two tickets for the stalls.They say there’s a new opera being given.If you like, we will give up to-day to one another; we will forget politics and war and everything, we will forget everything but that we are alive, breathing, thinking together; that we are one for ever—would you like that?’"
"“只要你喜欢，埃琳娜，”因萨罗夫回答道，“那么我也会喜欢。”","‘If you would like it, Elena,’ answered Insarov, ‘it follows that I should like it too.’"
"“我知道的，”埃琳娜笑着说道，“走，我们走。”","‘I knew that,’ observed Elena with a smile, ‘come, let us go.’"
"他们回到小船上，坐了下来，告诉船夫沿着大运河慢慢走。","They went back to the gondola, took their seats, told the gondolier to take them without hurry along the Canal Grande."
"没在四月份到过威尼斯的人无法领略这个城市所有的旖旎风光。被温婉的春光所笼罩着的威尼斯，就好比是夏日在艳阳高照下美得无与伦比的热那亚，或是秋日被金色和紫色装点着的伟大古都罗马。威尼斯之美，仿佛春天一样，拨动人的心弦，激起人们内心深处的渴望。它仿佛是承诺着幸福即将到来的诺言，撩拨着纯洁的心灵，神秘却不难捉摸。这里的一切都那么明朗，笼罩在一层沉寂却触手可及的爱情薄雾之中；这里的一切都那么宁静而友善；这里的一切，从名字开始都那么阴柔娇美。众所周知，这是座“美丽之城”。一群群宏伟壮观的宫殿和教堂就像是年轻天使优雅的梦境一般精致美好。运河静淌的流水泛着一层灰绿色的柔软光晕，小船悄无声息地从水面划过，没有了城市的喧嚣、噪杂、碰撞和吵闹，这景致有些许梦幻、些许奇异、些许迷人。“威尼斯已死，威尼斯已经消逝。”居住在这座城市的公民会这样告诉你。但是这最后的魅力——这衰落的魅力——却是她百花盛开、美得不可方物的鼎盛时期所不曾拥有的。没有见过她的人是无法真正了解她的。无论是卡纳莱托还是瓜尔迪（更别说后来的画家了）都无法描绘出这闪着银光的温柔氛围，这如此接近却难以捉摸的地平线，这精致的线条和逐渐融合的色彩之间绝妙的和谐。如果一个人很长寿，或是被生活摧残得心力交瘁，那么他不适合来威尼斯。她会残酷地唤起他早年那些未完成的梦想。但如果是一个活力十足、倍感幸福的人，那么威尼斯对他而言是甜蜜的。他能够在迷人的天空下尽享幸福。不管他的生活多么美妙，威尼斯都会用她无尽的光辉，让他的生活更加金光闪闪。","No one who has not seen Venice in April knows all the unutterable fascinations of that magic town.The softness and mildness of spring harmonise with Venice, just as the glaring sun of summer suits the magnificence of Genoa, and as the gold and purple of autumn suits the grand antiquity of Rome.The beauty of Venice, like the spring, touches the soul and moves it to desire; it frets and tortures the inexperienced heart like the promise of a coming bliss, mysterious but not elusive.Everything in it is bright, and everything is wrapt in a drowsy, tangible mist, as it were, of the hush of love; everything in it is so silent, and everything in it is kindly; everything in it is feminine, from its name upwards.It has well been given the name of ‘the fair city.’Its masses of palaces and churches stand out light and wonderful like the graceful dream of a young god; there is something magical, something strange and bewitching in the greenish-grey light and silken shimmer of the silent water of the canals, in the noiseless gliding of the gondolas, in the absence of the coarse din of a town, the coarse rattling, and crashing, and uproar.‘Venice is dead, Venice is deserted,’ her citizens will tell you, but perhaps this last charm—the charm of decay—was not vouchsafed her in the very heyday of the flower and majesty of her beauty.He who has not seen her, knows her not; neither Canaletto nor Guardi (to say nothing of later painters) has been able to convey the silvery tenderness of the atmosphere, the horizon so close, yet so elusive, the divine harmony of exquisite lines and melting colours.One who has outlived his life, who has been crushed by it, should not visit Venice; she will be cruel to him as the memory of unfulfilled dreams of early days; but sweet to one whose strength is at its full, who is conscious of happiness; let him bring his bliss under her enchanted skies; and however bright it may be, Venice will make it more golden with her unfading splendour."
"因萨罗夫和埃琳娜所乘坐的小船缓缓驶过斯基亚沃尼河的堤岸、总督府和广场，进入到大运河中。两岸全是宏伟的宫殿。它们仿佛从小船两侧慢慢飘过，让人来不及用眼睛去抓住或领略它们的美。埃琳娜感觉自己沉浸在甜蜜的幸福之中。她的天空一片蔚蓝，只有一片乌云——而且离她很远。因萨罗夫那天看起来气色不错。他们在欣赏过里亚尔托桥的形状后，就折返回去了。埃琳娜担心因萨罗夫受不了教堂的阴冷，但她又想起了美术馆，就让船夫朝那个方向划去。他们很快地走遍了这个小博物馆的每个展厅。他们不是鉴赏家，也不故作内行，因此，他们并没有在每一幅画前都停下脚步，不强迫自己。他们感到了一种轻松的愉悦。突然所有东西都看起来那么有趣。（孩子们深深地懂得这种感受。）埃琳娜看见一幅画中，丁托列托画的圣马可像青蛙跳水一般从天上跳下来拯救世间受苦受难的奴隶，她笑得连眼泪都出来了，全然不顾身边三个英国人的嘲笑。同样，一个精神旺盛、身披绿斗篷的男人在提香的《圣母升天图》前面站立着，随着画上的圣母高举双手，他的背和小腿肚子也让因萨罗夫兴奋不已。然而画上的圣母——一个端庄且坚毅的女人，平静地、庄严地朝天父的怀抱中走去——却让因萨罗夫和埃琳娜诧异不已。他们同样也很喜欢老人奇马·达·科内利亚诺那幅朴素却虔诚的画。他们走出美术馆时，看了一眼跟在后面的那几个英国人——那如同兔子一般的长牙和长长的络腮胡子——笑了起来。他们看见自己的船夫穿着那件超短的上衣和短裤——又咧开了嘴。他们还看见一个卖旧衣服的女人满头花白，却挽了个小髻——就笑得更开心了。他们互相看了一眼——又发出一声声爽朗的笑声。他们一在小船上坐定，就彼此用力地紧紧握住对方的手，不再放开。他们回到旅馆，跑进自己的房间，然后让侍者把食物送进来。他们这种愉快的心情一直持续到了晚餐时间。他们劝彼此多吃一点儿，为远在莫斯科的朋友的健康而干杯，为侍者端来的一条鲜美的鱼而鼓掌。他们让侍者上些新鲜的海鲜，侍者耸了耸肩，在地上擦了擦脚，但当他离开他们身边之后，他摇了摇头，有一次甚至还叹了一口气，可怜虫！（可怜的人！）","The gondola in which Insarov and Elena were sitting passed Riva dei Schiavoni, the palace of the Doges, and Piazzetta, and entered the Grand Canal.On both sides stretched marble palaces; they seemed to float softly by, scarcely letting the eye seize or absorb their beauty.Elena felt herself deeply happy; in the perfect blue of her heavens there was only one dark cloud—and it was in the far distance; Insarov was much better that day.They glided as far as the acute angle of the Rialto and turned back.Elena was afraid of the chill of the churches for Insarov; but she remembered the academy delle Belle Arti, and told the gondolier to go towards it.They quickly walked through all the rooms of that little museum.Being neither connoisseurs nor dilettantes, they did not stop before every picture; they put no constraint on themselves; a spirit of light-hearted gaiety came over them.Everything seemed suddenly very entertaining.(Children know this feeling very well.)To the great scandal of three English visitors, Elena laughed till she cried over the St Mark of Tintoretto, skipping down from the sky like a frog into the water, to deliver the tortured slave; Insarov in his turn fell into raptures over the back and legs of the sturdy man in the green cloak, who stands in the foreground of Titian’s Ascension and holds his arms outstretched after the Madonna; but the Madonna—a splendid, powerful woman, calmly and majestically making her way towards the bosom of God the Father—impressed both Insarov and Elena; they liked, too, the austere and reverent painting of the elder Cima da Conegliano.As they were leaving the academy, they took another look at the Englishmen behind them—with their long rabbit-like teeth and drooping whiskers—and laughed; they glanced at their gondolier with his abbreviated jacket and short breeches—and laughed; they caught sight of a woman selling old clothes with a knob of grey hair on the very top of her head—and laughed more than ever; they looked into one another’s face—and went off into peals of laughter, and directly they had sat down in the gondola, they clasped each other’s hand in a close, close grip.They reached their hotel, ran into their room, and ordered dinner to be brought in.Their gaiety did not desert them at dinner.They pressed each other to eat, drank to the health of their friends in Moscow, clapped their hands at the waiter for a delicious dish of fish, and kept asking him for live frutti di mare; the waiter shrugged his shoulders and scraped with his feet, but when he had left them, he shook his head and once even muttered with a sigh, poveretti! (poor things!)"
"用过晚餐，他们又前往剧院。","After dinner they set off for the theatre."
"上演的是威尔第的歌剧。坦率地说，这出歌剧相当通俗，但在欧洲各大剧院的巡回演出却十分成功，在俄罗斯也以《茶花女》的名字家喻户晓。威尼斯的演出季已经过去，每个歌剧演员的水平也非常平庸，只是尽其所能地扯着嗓子大喊。饰演维奥莉塔的那个女演员也是名不见经传。从观众对她的冷淡态度可以看出来，她不得人心，但她却不乏天赋。她是一个年轻却不十分漂亮的女孩，眼睛黑黑的，嗓音不平稳，已经快要破了。她的衣服选得很糟糕，看起来幼稚且俗气，头发被包裹在一个红色的发网中。她身穿一件掉了色的蓝色缎子，整个身体被紧紧地包裹起来，一双做工粗糙的瑞典手套一直戴到尖尖的臂肘上。确实，一个贝加莫牧羊人的女儿怎么会知道巴黎的茶花女是如何打扮的呢！而且她在台上都不知道该如何移动，但她的表演中却处处显露着真诚和毫无修饰的东西。当她演唱时，她的嗓音中有一种只有意大利人才有的表现力和韵律。埃琳娜和因萨罗夫坐在舞台边上一个灯光昏暗的包厢内。他们依然保持着在艺术馆产生的愉悦情绪。那位不幸坠入美色陷阱的年轻人的父亲出场了。他身穿黄色礼服，顶着一头乱蓬蓬的灰白假头套。他还没出声就开始怯场，咧着嘴，只发出一声微弱的低颤音。他们禁不住大笑了起来。……但是，维奥莉塔的演出却深深地震撼了他们。","They were giving an opera of Verdi’s, which though, honestly speaking, rather vulgar, has already succeeded in making the round of all the European theatres, an opera, well-known among Russians, La Traviata.The season in Venice was over, and none of the singers rose above the level of mediocrity; every one shouted to the best of their abilities.The part of Violetta was performed by an artist, of no renown, and judging by the cool reception given her by the public, not a favourite, but she was not destitute of talent.She was a young, and not very pretty, black-eyed girl with an unequal and already overstrained voice.Her dress was ill-chosen and naively gaudy; her hair was hidden in a red net, her dress of faded blue satin was too tight for her, and thick Swedish gloves reached up to her sharp elbows.Indeed, how could she, the daughter of some Bergamese shepherd, know how Parisian dames aux camelias dress!And she did not understand how to move on the stage; but there was much truth and artless simplicity in her acting, and she sang with that passion of expression and rhythm which is only vouchsafed to Italians.Elena and Insarov were sitting alone together in a dark box close to the stage; the mirthful mood which had come upon them in the academy delle Belle Arti had not yet passed off.When the father of the unhappy young man who had fallen into the snares of the enchantress came on to the stage in a yellow frock-coat and a dishevelled white wig, opened his mouth awry, and losing his presence of mind before he had begun, only brought out a faint bass tremolo, they almost burst into laughter.… But Violetta’s acting impressed them."
"“他们几乎没为那个可怜的姑娘鼓掌，”埃琳娜说道，“但是我觉得，她的演出要比那些矫揉造作、哗众取宠、自高自大的二流演员好一千倍。这个女孩的演出就像是完全发自内心的。看，她完全不在意观众的反应。”","‘They hardly clap that poor girl at all,’ said Elena, ‘but I like her a thousand times better than some conceited second-rate celebrity who would grimace and attitudinise all the while for effect.This girl seems as though it were all in earnest; look, she pays no attention to the public.’"
"因萨罗夫靠在包厢的墙上，聚精会神地盯着维奥莉塔。","Insarov bent over the edge of the box, and looked attentively at Violetta."
"“没错，”他赞同地说道，“她很用心，她已经感觉到了自己站在死亡的边缘。”","‘Yes,’ he commented, ’she is in earnest; she’s on the brink of the grave herself.’"
"埃琳娜沉默了。","Elena was mute."
"第三幕开场了。幕布拉起——一看到床、拉开的窗帘、药瓶和带罩的灯，埃琳娜身不由己地颤抖了一下。她想起了不久前的过往。“未来会怎么样？现在又怎么样？”这些念头从她的脑海中闪过。仿佛是在回应她，演员在台上发出了一阵假装的咳嗽声，紧接着传来的是因萨罗夫不折不扣的、沙哑、恐怖的咳嗽声。埃琳娜悄悄瞥了他一眼，然后在脸上表现出一种平静、恬淡的表情。因萨罗夫知道她在想什么。他微笑起来，嘴里轻轻地哼着歌。","The third act began.The curtain rose—Elena shuddered at the sight of the bed, the drawn curtains, the glass of medicine, the shaded lamps.She recalled the near past.‘What of the future?What of the present?’ flashed across her mind.As though in response to her thought, the artist’s mimic cough on the stage was answered in the box by the hoarse, terribly real cough of Insarov.Elena stole a glance at him, and at once gave her features a calm and untroubled expression; Insarov understood her, and he began himself to smile, and softly to hum the tune of the song."
"但是他很快又安静了下来。维奥莉塔的表演变得更加稳定、奔放了。她去掉了一切浮饰，找到了真我。这对于艺术家而言是一种罕见而崇高的快乐。她一下子就越过了难以定义的边界，到达了艺术之美的永恒疆域。观众们都被深深地震撼住了。那个相貌平凡、声音断断续续的姑娘开始把握、掌控了观众的心。她的声音已经不像刚开始那样断断续续了，它变得圆润而有力量。阿尔弗雷多登场了。维奥莉塔兴奋的叫喊声几乎在观众中掀起了一阵狂潮，相比起来，我们这些北方观众的掌声简直不值一提。片刻之后——观众又平静了下来。这出戏剧中的经典，二重唱，开始了。在这个部分中，作曲家成功地将挥霍青春、绝望的最后一搏和没有希望的爱这一系列痛苦表现得淋漓尽致。女歌者深深地抓住了观众的心，引导着他们的情绪，眼里含着艺术家喜悦却痛彻心扉的泪水。她将自己置身于内心的激情风浪之中。她的脸已经扭曲。在各种可怕的、预示着死亡即将到来的征兆面前，她爆发出来的台词：“让我活下去吧——我还这么年轻！”如暴风雨般的祷告升上天堂，令整个剧院充斥着观众们的雷鸣般的掌声和欢快的叫喊声。","But he was soon quiet.Violetta’s acting became steadily better, and freer.She had thrown aside everything subsidiary, everything superfluous, and found herself; a rare, a lofty delight for an artist!She had suddenly crossed the limit, which it is impossible to define, beyond which is the abiding place of beauty.The audience was thrilled and astonished.The plain girl with the broken voice began to get a hold on it, to master it.And the singer’s voice even did not sound broken now; it had gained mellowness and strength.Alfredo made his entrance; Violetta’s cry of happiness almost raised that storm in the audience known as fanatisme, beside which all the applause of our northern audiences is nothing.A brief interval passed—and again the audience were in transports.The duet began, the best thing in the opera, in which the composer has succeeded in expressing all the pathos of the senseless waste of youth, the final struggle of despairing, helpless love.Caught up and carried along by the general sympathy, with tears of artistic delight and real suffering in her eyes, the singer let herself be borne along on the wave of passion within her; her face was transfigured, and in the presence of the threatening signs of fast approaching death, the words: ‘Lascia mi vivero—morir si giovane’ (let me live—to die so young!) burst from her in such a tempest of prayer rising to heaven, that the whole theatre shook with frenzied applause and shouts of delight."
"埃琳娜觉得浑身冰冷。她的手轻柔地找寻着因萨罗夫的手，一找到就紧紧地抓住不放。他同样紧紧地握住她的手。但是他们谁都没有看对方一下。这与几个小时之前他们在小船上互相握住双手的感觉很不同。","Elena felt cold all over.Softly her hand sought Insarov’s, found it, and clasped it tightly.He responded to its pressure; but she did not look at him, nor he at her.Very different was the clasp of hands with which they had greeted each other in the gondola a few hours before."
"然后他们再次乘着小船，沿着大运河向旅店驶去。夜幕降临了，那是一个明朗、柔和的夜。曾经见过的宫殿现在看起来似乎有所不同。这些宫殿被浅黄色的月光笼罩着。在这月光之下，宫殿的阳台和窗户上的装饰和线条似乎消失了。而他们在这群被薄雾笼罩的建筑物之中却越加明显。那些点着小红灯的小船从水面掠过，似乎比以前更安静、快速。它们的钢喙闪着神秘的光辉，船桨在银色小鱼激起的波浪上起起落落。到处都能听到船夫简短、柔和的叫喊声（他们现在已经不唱歌了）。几乎再也听不到其他的声音。因萨罗夫和埃琳娜居住的旅店位于斯基亚沃尼河畔。他们在中途就下了小船，一遍又一遍地绕着圣马可广场溜达，在拱桥下来来回回地走。那里的小咖啡馆前聚集了许多游客。在一个陌生的城市，在一群陌生人中，跟自己所爱的人散步会有一种特别的甜蜜。一切看起来都那么美、那么有意义，所有人看起来都那么善良，和蔼。你希望每个人都能被你满心的幸福所包围。但是埃琳娜现在无论如何都没有办法去体味那种无与伦比的幸福了。她的心在经过刚才的震撼之后，再也无法平复下来，而因萨罗夫从总督府旁边经过时，一言不发地指了指从低拱门下探出的几门奥地利大炮的炮口，然后拉了拉帽子，遮住了眼睛。这会儿他感觉到累了。他最后看了一眼圣马可教堂，看了看那在月光照耀下闪着明亮磷光的蓝色铅板圆屋顶。他们慢慢地走回了住处。","Again they glided along the Canal Grande towards their hotel.Night had set in now, a clear, soft night.The same palaces met them, but they seemed different.Those that were lighted up by the moon shone with pale gold, and in this pale light all details of ornaments and lines of windows and balconies seemed lost; they stood out more clearly in the buildings that were wrapped in a light veil of unbroken shadow.The gondolas, with their little red lamps, seemed to flit past more noiselessly and swiftly than ever; their steel beaks flashed mysteriously, mysteriously their oars rose and fell over the ripples stirred by little silvery fish; here and there was heard the brief, subdued call of a gondolier (they never sing now); scarcely another sound was to be heard.The hotel where Insarov and Elena were staying was on the Riva dei Schiavoni; before they reached it they left the gondola, and walked several times round the Square of St. Mark, under the arches, where numbers of holiday makers were gathered before the tiny cafes.There is a special sweetness in wandering alone with one you love, in a strange city among strangers; everything seems beautiful and full of meaning, you feel peace and goodwill to all men, you wish all the same happiness that fills your heart.But Elena could not now give herself up without a care to the sense of her happiness; her heart could not regain its calm after the emotions that had so lately shaken it; and Insarov, as he walked by the palace of the Doges, pointed without speaking to the mouths of the Austrian cannons, peeping out from the lower arches, and pulled his hat down over his eyes.By now he felt tired, and, with a last glance at the church of St. Mark, at its cupola, where on the bluish lead bright patches of phosphorescent light shone in the rays of the moon, they turned slowly homewards."
"从他们那个小房间的窗子向外望去是一个浅湖。它从斯基亚沃尼河堤一直延伸到朱代卡。那高高耸立的圣乔治尖塔几乎正对着他们所居住的小旅馆。右边是海关大楼金灿灿的球顶，直冲云霄，还有教堂中最漂亮的帕拉迪奥救世主教堂，装扮得像新娘一样；左边是一些帆船漆黑的桅杆、索具和一些汽船的烟囱，有一处挂着一张收拢的帆，像翅膀一样，旗子挂在那纹丝不动。因萨罗夫在窗户旁边坐下欣赏夜景，但是埃琳娜不让他看太久。突然他好像有点儿发烧，一阵虚弱向他袭来。她让他在床上躺下，等到他进入梦乡，她走回到窗户旁边。哦，多么宁静，美好的夜晚，深蓝色的天空中弥漫着像鸽子一样的温柔气息。所有的痛苦、所有的悲伤，在如此明朗的天空下，在如此纯洁、神圣的月光下，都会消失无踪。“上帝啊，”埃琳娜思索着，“为什么要有死亡，为什么要有别离、伤病和眼泪？而为什么又要有这良辰美景，有这甜蜜的希望，有这令人慰藉的避难所，这永恒不变的支持和持久的保护？这带着笑意和祝福的天空，这开心的、沉睡着的大地，又有着怎样的含义？难道这只存在于我们之中，而我们身外就只剩下冷漠和死气沉沉？难道我们所能拥有的就只有孤独……孤独……而所有的一切，在这无法触及的深渊中——没有什么同我们一样，所有，所有这一切对于我们来说都是陌生的，都不属于我们？那么，我们为什么还要有欲望，还要祈祷快乐？”（“年纪轻轻就要离开这个世界”在她心里回荡着。）“这真的不可能吗，不可能去劝解，去避免，去保护……哦，上帝啊！真的不能相信奇迹的降临吗？”她用双手紧紧地蒙住自己的脸。“够了。”她轻轻说道，“真的够了！我有过快乐，不仅仅是一瞬间、几个小时或者短短几天，而是好几个星期。但我有什么权利幸福快乐呢？”想到自己的幸福，她就感到一阵恐惧，“如果不是那个样子？”她思考道，“又假如有可能呢？哎，我拥有过天堂般的幸福……我们这些卑微的凡人，可怜的、有罪的凡人……这么年轻就面临死亡。哦，不祥的征兆，滚开吧！他需要好起来，不仅为了我！”","Their little room looked out on to the lagoon, which stretches from the Riva del Schiavoni to the Giudecca.Almost facing their hotel rose the slender tower of S. George; high against the sky on the right shone the golden ball of the Customs House; and, decked like a bride, stood the loveliest of the churches, the Redentore of Palladio; on the left were the black masts and rigging of ships, the funnels of steamers; a half-furled sail hung in one place like a great wing, and the flags scarcely stirred.Insarov sat down at the window, but Elena did not let him admire the view for long; he seemed suddenly feverish, he was overcome by consuming weakness.She put him to bed, and, waiting till he had fallen asleep, she returned to the window.Oh, how still and kindly was the night, what dovelike softness breathed in the deep-blue air!Every suffering, every sorrow surely must be soothed to slumber under that clear sky, under that pure, holy light!‘O God,’ thought Elena, ‘why must there be death, why is there separation, and disease and tears? or else, why this beauty, this sweet feeling of hope, this soothing sense of an abiding refuge, an unchanging support, an everlasting protection?What is the meaning of this smiling, blessing sky; this happy, sleeping earth?Can it be that all that is only in us, and that outside us is eternal cold and silence?Can it be that we are alone… alone… and there, on all sides, in all those unattainable depths and abysses—nothing is akin to us; all, all is strange and apart from us?Why, then, have we this desire for, this delight in prayer?’ (Morir si giovane was echoing in her heart.)…‘Is it impossible, then, to propitiate, to avert, to save…O God!is it impossible to believe in miracle?’She dropped her head on to her clasped hands.‘Enough,’ she whispered.‘Indeed enough!I have been happy not for moments only, not for hours, not for whole days even, but for whole weeks together.And what right had I to happiness?’She felt terror at the thought of her happiness.‘What, if that cannot be?’ she thought.‘What, if it is not granted for nothing?Why, it has been heaven… and we are mortals, poor sinful mortals….Morir si giovane.Oh, dark omen, away!It’s not only for me his life is needed!"
"“但是，如果这是惩罚，”她又想道，“如果现在就必须为我们的罪过付出全部代价？我的良心一直是宁静的，现在也依然安宁，但是这就是没有过错的证据吗？上帝啊！莫非我们真的罪无可恕！创造了这个夜晚、这片天空的上帝啊，您难道因为我们相爱就要惩罚我们吗？“如果是这样的话，如果他有罪，如果我有罪，”她脱口而出，“那么，就请您让他，让我们俩，至少光彩地死去吧——在那里，在他的祖国，而不是在这间阴暗的屋子里。”","‘But what, if it is a punishment,’ she thought again; ‘what, if we must now pay the penalty of our guilt in full?My conscience was silent, it is silent now, but is that a proof of innocence?O God, can we be so guilty!Canst Thou who hast created this night, this sky, wish to punish us for having loved each other?If it be so, if he has sinned, if I have sinned,’ she added with involuntary force, ’grant that he, O God, grant that we both, may die at least a noble, glorious death—there, on the plains of his country, not here in this dark room."
"“我那可怜孤独的母亲的悲伤该怎么办？”她问自己。她心乱如麻，找不到问题的答案。埃琳娜还不明白每个人的幸福都是建立在其他人的不幸之上，就连一个人的成功和惬意都建立在其他人的失败和难过之上，就如同每个雕像都一定会有它的底座一样。","‘And the grief of my poor, lonely mother?’ she asked herself, and was bewildered, and could find no answer to her question.Elena did not know that every man’s happiness is built on the unhappiness of another, that even his advantage, his comfort, like a statue needs a pedestal, the disadvantage, the discomfort of others."
"“伦迪奇！”熟睡中的因萨罗夫嘟囔着。","‘Renditch!’ muttered Insarov in his sleep."
"埃琳娜轻手轻脚地走到他的跟前，弯下腰，擦拭去他脸上的汗水。他在枕头上翻滚了几下就又不动了。","Elena went up to him on tiptoe, bent over him, and wiped the perspiration from his face.He tossed a little on his pillow, and was still again."
"她又走到窗户旁边，然后思绪又开始蔓延。她开始与自己争论，告诉自己没有什么需要担心的。她甚至开始为她的懦弱而羞愧。“会有危险吗？难道他不会好转了？”她嘟囔着说，“为什么，如果我们今天没有去剧院，这一切都不会在我的脑中出现。”","She went back again to the window, and again her thoughts took possession of her.She began to argue with herself, to assure herself that there was no reason to be afraid.She even began to feel ashamed of her weakness.‘Is there any danger?isn’t he better?’ she murmured.‘Why, if we had not been at the theatre to-day, all this would never have entered my head.’"
"在那一瞬间，她看见水面上空有一只海鸥翱翔而过。它看上去像是刚受了渔夫的惊吓，因为它悄无声息地到处乱飞，像在寻找一个可以落脚的地方。“来吧，如果它飞到这里来，”埃琳娜想道，“这将是一个好兆头。”海鸥在天空盘旋了一圈，收起翅膀，仿佛中了枪似的，发出一声凄厉的叫声，在远处一艘黑漆漆的船后一段距离的地方掉了下来。埃琳娜颤抖着，然后又为自己的颤抖而感到羞愧。她穿着衣服躺到了床上，躺在了呼吸急促并沉重的因萨罗夫身旁。","At that instant she saw high above the water a white sea-gull; some fisherman had scared it, it seemed, for it flew noiselessly with uncertain course, as though seeking a spot where it could alight.‘Come, if it flies here,’ thought Elena, ‘it will be a good omen.’ … The sea-gull flew round in a circle, folded its wings, and, as though it had been shot, dropped with a plaintive cry in the distance behind a dark ship.Elena shuddered; then she was ashamed of having shuddered, and, without undressing, she lay down on the bed beside Insarov, who was breathing quickly and heavily."
"第三十四章","CHAPTER XXXIV"
"因萨罗夫很晚才起来。他起床时头很疼，而且他说感觉全身有种讨厌的虚弱感。但是，他还是起来了。","Insarov waked late with a dull pain in his head, and a feeling, as he expressed it, of disgusting weakness all over.He got up however."
"“伦迪奇还没来吗？”他刚一睡醒就问道。","‘Renditch has not come?’ was his first question."
"“还没来。”埃琳娜回答道，然后递给他最新版的《的里雅斯提诺观察报》。报纸上满版都是关于战争、斯拉夫各地区和各公国的消息。因萨罗夫开始看报纸，而埃琳娜则忙着给他煮咖啡。这时，一阵敲门声传来。","‘Not yet,’ answered Elena, and she handed him the latest number of the Osservatore Triestino, in which there was much upon the war, the Slav Provinces, and the Principalities.Insarov began reading it; she busied herself in getting some coffee ready for him.Some one knocked at the door."
"“伦迪奇。”这是他们的第一反应，但是一句俄语传了进来，“我能进来吗？”埃琳娜和因萨罗夫吃惊地望着对方。他们还没来得及回答，一个衣着得体的年轻人就走进了房间。他有张棱角分明的小脸和一双明亮的小眼睛。他满面笑容，就像刚发了一笔横财或者刚听到一个让人欣喜不已的好消息一样。","‘Renditch,’ both thought at once, but a voice said in Russian, ‘May I come in?’Elena and Insarov looked at each other in astonishment; and without waiting for an answer, an elegantly dressed young man entered the room, with a small sharp-featured face, and bright little eyes.He was beaming all over, as though he had just won a fortune or heard a most delightful piece of news."
"因萨罗夫从椅子上站起身来。","Insarov got up from his seat."
"“您不认得我了吗，”这个陌生人开口说道，并且一点儿也不见外地走到他的面前，很有礼貌地向埃琳娜欠了欠身，“卢波亚罗夫，您还记得吗，以前我们在莫斯科叶——家中见过的。”","‘You don’t recognise me,’ began the stranger, going up to him with an easy air, and bowing politely to Elena, ‘Lupoyarov, do you remember, we met at Moscow at the E—’s.’"
"“是的，是在叶——的家。”因萨罗夫回答道。","‘Yes, at the E—’s,’ replied Insarov."
"“确实是，确实是！麻烦您为我引荐您的夫人。夫人，我一向很敬重德米特里·瓦西里耶维奇,”（他改口）——“是尼卡诺尔 ·瓦西里耶维奇，我非常高兴最终有这个荣幸能够与您相识。猜猜，”他转向因萨罗夫说道，“我是昨晚才知道您住在这里。我也住在这家旅店。这座城市真小！威尼斯就是一首诗——那是能描述她的唯一的词汇！只有一件事情非常糟糕：到处都能遇到该死的奥地利人！啊，这些可恨的奥地利人！对了，您听说了吗，一场决定性的战役已经在多瑙河畔打响了：三百名土耳其军官丧生，锡利斯特拉已经被攻下，塞尔维亚终于宣布独立了。您，作为一个爱国者，应该非常高兴吧，不是吗？即便是我身上流淌着的斯拉夫热血也好像燃烧起来了！但是我还是建议您要多加小心，我确信有人正密切关注着您。这里的间谍非常可恶！一个形迹可疑的人昨天走到我面前，问：‘你是俄国人吗？’我告诉他我是丹麦人。您看起来气色不好，亲爱的尼卡诺尔·瓦西里耶维奇。您应该去找个医生看看。夫人，您应该带您的丈夫去看医生。昨天我近乎疯狂地游览了所有的宫殿和教堂。你们一定去过总督府吧？那里的一切都太壮观了！特别是大厅堂和马里诺·法列罗的位置，上面写着‘因罪而杀头’。我也去了那座著名的监狱。您能想到的，那里让我义愤填膺。我总是，您或许记得，我一直都热衷于研究社会问题，并且始终反对贵族专制——我一直想把那些维护贵族统治的人送到那里去——到那些地牢中去。正如拜伦说的那样：‘我伫立在威尼斯的叹息桥上’，虽然他也是个贵族。我总是在追寻进步——年轻的一代都是进步的拥护者。你觉得英国人和法国人如何？我们就看看他们会不会有所作为，布斯特拉巴和帕默斯顿。您知道，帕默斯顿已经做了首相。不，不论您说什么，俄国人的拳头都不是好惹的。那个布斯特拉巴可真是个让人厌恶的家伙！如果您有兴趣，我可以把维克多·雨果的《惩罚集》借给您——写得太棒了——未来，上帝的宪兵——写得相当大胆，但是充满了力量，充满了力量。维亚泽姆斯基公爵也说得不错：‘欧罗巴一遍又一遍地提到，巴什卡德克拉尔眼睛一动不动地盯着锡诺普。’我喜爱诗歌。我还有蒲鲁东的最新著作——这种书我那里应有尽有。我不知道您是什么感觉，但是我很开心爆发了这场战争。只要我的祖国不需要我回去，我就从这里去佛罗伦萨，再去罗马。我不能去法国——所以我想去西班牙——听说那里的女人，太美了！只是太穷了，而且虫子很多。我有过去加利福尼亚的计划——我们俄国人准备好了去做任何事——但是我答应了一个刊物写一些关于地中海贸易问题的报告。您可能认为这类题目没什么意思，专业性太强了吧，但是这类专家正是我们所需要的。我们的哲学理论已经很深厚了，我们现在需要的是实际，实际。但是您看上去非常不好，尼卡诺尔·瓦西里耶维奇，也许是我让您劳神了，但是我还是要再呆一会儿。”","‘To be sure, to be sure!I beg you to present me to your wife.Madam, I have always had the profoundest respect for Dmitri Vassilyevitch’ (he corrected himself)—‘for Nikanor Vassilyevitch, and am very happy to have the pleasure at last of making your acquaintance.Fancy,’ he continued, turning to Insarov, ‘I only heard yesterday evening that you were here.I am staying at this hotel too.What a city!Venice is poetry—that’s the only word for it!But one thing’s really awful: the cursed Austrians meeting one at every turn!ah, these Austrians!By the way, have you heard, there’s been a decisive battle on the Danube: three hundred Turkish officers killed, Silistria taken; Servia has declared its independence.You, as a patriot, ought to be in transports, oughtn’t you?Even my Slavonic blood’s positively on fire!I advise you to be more careful, though; I’m convinced there’s a watch kept on you.The spies here are something awful!A suspicious-looking man came up to me yesterday and asked: “Are you a Russian?”I told him I was a Dane.But you seem unwell, dear Nikanor Vassilyevitch.You ought to see a doctor; madam, you ought to make your husband see a doctor.Yesterday I ran through the palaces and churches, as though I were crazy.I suppose you’ve been in the palace of the Doges?What magnificence everywhere!Especially that great hall and Marino Faliero’s place: there’s an inscription: decapitati pro criminibus.I’ve been in the famous prisons too; that threw me into indignation, you may fancy.I’ve always, you remember perhaps, taken an interest in social questions, and taken sides against aristocracy—well, that’s where I should like to send the champions of aristocracy—to those dungeons.How well Byron said: I stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs; though he was an aristocrat too.I was always for progress—the younger generation are all for progress.And what do you say to the Anglo-French business?We shall see whether they can do much, Boustrapa and Palmerston.You know Palmerston has been made Prime Minister.No, say what you like, the Russian fist is not to be despised.He’s awfully deep that Boustrapa!If you like I will lend you Les Chatiments de Victor Hugo—it’s marvellous—L’avenir, le gendarme de Dieu—rather boldly written, but what force in it, what force!That was a fine saying, too, of Prince Vyazemsky’s: “Europe repeats: Bash-Kadik-Lar keeping an eye on Sinope.”I adore poetry.I have Proudhon’s last work, too—I have everything.I don’t know how you feel, but I’m glad of the war; only as I’m not required at home, I’m going from here to Florence, and to Rome.France I can’t go to—so I’m thinking of Spain—the women there, I’m told, are marvellous! only such poverty, and so many insects.I would be off to California—we Russians are ready to do anything—but I promised an editor to study the question of the commerce of the Mediterranean in detail.You will say that’s an uninteresting, special subject, but that’s just what we need, specialists; we have philosophised enough, now we need the practical, the practical.But you are very unwell, Nikanor Vassilyevitch, I am tiring you, perhaps, but still I must stay a little longer.’"
"卢波亚罗夫口若悬河地说了半天，临走的时候说还要来拜访。","And for a long time Lupoyarov still babbled on in the same way, and, as he went away, he promised to come again."
"因萨罗夫被这不速之客弄得筋疲力尽，躺在了沙发上。“这就是，”他看了看埃琳娜，心情沉痛地说，“你们的年轻一代！他们喜欢自吹自擂，狂妄自大，但是实际上，他们只是脑袋空空的话篓子而已。”","Worn out by the unexpected visit, Insarov lay down on the sofa.‘So this,’ he said, mournfully looking at Elena, ‘is your younger generation!There are plenty who show off, and give themselves airs, while at heart they are as empty chatterboxes as that worthy.’"
"埃琳娜没有回答她的丈夫。在那一刻，她更关心的是因萨罗夫那虚弱的身体而不是俄国年轻一代的特点。她在他身边坐下，干着手工活。他闭上眼睛，躺在那一动不动，脸色苍白，身体瘦弱。埃琳娜看了一眼他瘦削的侧影，看着他枯瘦的两只手，心里感到一阵害怕。","Elena made no reply to her husband; at that instant she was far more concerned at Insarov’s weakness than at the character of the whole younger generation in Russia.She sat down near him, and took up some work.He closed his eyes, and lay without moving, white and thin.Elena glanced at his sharp profile, at his emaciated hands, and felt a sudden pang of terror."
"“德米特里。”她说道。","‘Dmitri,’ she began."
"他动了动身体。“嗯？伦迪奇来了吗？”","He started.‘Eh? Has Renditch come?’"
"“还没来——但是你感觉怎么样——你在发烧，你的身体真的很不好，我们是不是该去请个医生？”","‘Not yet—but what do you think—you are in a fever, you are really not quite well, shouldn’t we send for a doctor?’"
"“那个话痨把你吓到了吧。没那个必要。我只要休息一会儿，很快就会好的。吃过晚饭我们再出去——到处转转。","‘That wretched gossip has frightened you.There’s no necessity.I will rest a little, and it will pass off.After dinner we will go out again—somewhere.’"
"两个小时过去了。因萨罗夫还是躺在沙发上，但是他没有睡着，虽然他依然闭着眼睛。埃琳娜一直在他身边坐着，她做的活计都掉到膝盖上了，但她却一动不动。","Two hours passed.Insarov still lay on the sofa, but he could not sleep, though he did not open his eyes.Elena did not leave his side; she had dropped her work upon her knee, and did not stir."
"“你怎么还不睡？”她终于开口问他。","‘Why don’t you go to sleep?’ she asked at last."
"“等一下吧。”他拿起她的手，把它放到头下面。“就这样——不错。等到伦迪奇来了就叫我起来。如果他说船准备好了，那我们就立刻动身。我们要先打包。”","‘Wait a little.’He took her hand, and placed it under his head.‘There—that is nice.Wake me at once directly Renditch comes.If he says the ship is ready, we will start at once.We ought to pack everything.’"
"“打包花不了多长时间。”埃琳娜说。","‘Packing won’t take long,’ answered Elena."
"“刚才那人对战争胡吹了一番，提到了塞尔维亚。”过了一小会儿，因萨罗夫说，“我猜想他那是无中生有。但是我们必须，我们必须要启程了。没有时间可以浪费了。要准备好。”","‘That fellow babbled something about a battle, about Servia,’ said Insarov, after a short interval.‘I suppose he made it all up.But we must, we must start.We can’t lose time.Be ready.’"
"他睡着了，屋里的一切都陷入了宁静。","He fell asleep, and everything was still in the room."
"埃琳娜把头靠在椅背上，双眼久久地凝视着窗外。天气变得阴沉。风也刮起来了。天上风起云涌，在很远的地方，一根又细又长的桅杆在风中摇摆不定，一张有着红色十字的长旗不住地颤动，垂下来，然后又颤动起来。古旧的摆钟单调地摆动着，发出一种悲哀的声音。埃琳娜闭上眼睛。她一整晚都没睡好，渐渐地，她也进入了梦乡。","Elena let her head rest against the back of her chair, and gazed a long while out of the window.The weather had changed for the worse; the wind had risen.Great white clouds were scudding over the sky, a slender mast was swaying in the distance, a long streamer, with a red cross on it, kept fluttering, falling, and fluttering again.The pendulum of the old-fashioned clock ticked drearily, with a kind of melancholy whirr.Elena shut her eyes.She had slept badly all night; gradually she, too, fell asleep."
"她做了一个奇怪的梦。她梦见自己跟很多陌生人搭乘一条小船，在察里津诺湖上漂荡。他们都没有出声，一动不动地坐着，没人划桨，小船自己在走。埃琳娜并不害怕，但却觉得郁闷不已。她想知道这些人是谁，自己为何跟他们在一起。她观察着，湖在不断地变宽，湖岸消失了——现在这已经不是湖了，而是汹涌澎湃的大海：悄无声息的蓝色巨浪猛烈地摇动着小船，有一个令人恐惧的东西怒吼着从海底深处向上翻腾，和她一起坐船的陌生人们一下子跳起来，大声呼喊着，挥舞着双臂……埃琳娜看清了他们的脸。她的父亲正在其中。然而，一股白色的旋风袭来，在浪花上面盘旋——所有的一切都开始转动，混成一团。","She had a strange dream.She thought she was floating in a boat on the Tsaritsino lake with some unknown people.They did not speak, but sat motionless, no one was rowing; the boat was moving by itself.Elena was not afraid, but she felt dreary; she wanted to know who were these people, and why she was with them?She looked and the lake grew broader, the banks vanished—now it was not a lake but a stormy sea: immense blue silent waves rocked the boat majestically; something menacing, roaring was rising from the depths; her unknown companions jumped up, shrieking, wringing their hands…Elena recognised their faces; her father was among them.But a kind of white whirlwind came flying over the waves—everything was turning round, everything was confounded together."
"埃琳娜四处打量。周围之前是白茫茫的一片，但现在到处都是雪，雪，漫天的飞雪。此时，她已经不在小船上了，而是像她当时离开莫斯科那样，乘坐在雪橇上。她并不是孤单一人，她身边坐着一个裹着一件破烂大衣的小孩子。埃琳娜仔细地看了看，竟然是她小时候那可怜的女朋友卡佳。埃琳娜开始觉得害怕。“难道她还没有死吗？”她思考着。","Elena looked about her; as before, all around was white; but it was snow, snow, boundless plains of snow.And she was not now in a boat, but travelling, as she had come from Moscow, in a sledge; she was not alone; by her side was sitting a little creature muffled in an old cloak; Elena looked closely; it was Katya, her poor little friend.Elena was seized with terror.‘Why, isn’t she dead?’ she thought."
"“卡佳，我们这是要去哪里啊？”卡佳没有回答，只是把身上的那件大衣裹得更紧了。她冷得发颤。埃琳娜也觉得很冷，她沿路向远方望去。透过这飞舞的雪花，依稀可见一座城池。一些高耸的白塔和闪耀着银色光芒的圆顶……“卡佳，卡佳，这里是莫斯科吗？”“不，”埃琳娜想道，“这里是索洛韦茨基修道院啊，这里有很多像蜂房一样的小房间，又小又不透气——德米特里被囚禁在那里。我得把他救出来。”突然，她的面前突然出现一道巨大的灰色深渊。雪橇滑进了深渊，卡佳却露出了笑意。“埃琳娜，埃琳娜！”深渊中传来一个声音。","‘Katya, where are we going together?’Katya did not answer, and nestled herself closer in her little cloak; she was freezing.Elena too was cold; she looked along the road into the distance; far away a town could be seen through the fine drifting snow.High white towers with silvery cupolas…‘Katya, Katya, is it Moscow?No,’ thought Elena, ‘it is Solovetsky Monastery; it’s full of little narrow cells like a beehive; it’s stifling, cramping there—and Dmitri’s shut up there.I must rescue him.’… Suddenly a grey, yawning abyss opened before her.The sledge was falling, Katya was laughing.‘Elena, Elena!’ came a voice from the abyss."
"“埃琳娜！”她的耳边清清楚楚地传来了叫喊声。她一下子抬起头，转过去，被吓了一跳：因萨罗夫的脸上毫无血色，像雪一样白，那雪的颜色跟梦中的一模一样。他从沙发上略略直起身子，用那双明亮却可怕的大眼睛盯着她。他的头发乱糟糟地散落在额头上，嘴唇怪模怪样地张着。他那突然扭曲的脸上流露出恐惧，还夹杂着一种温柔的痛苦。","‘Elena!’ sounded distinctly in her ears.She raised her head quickly, turned round, and was stupefied: Insarov, white as snow, the snow of her dream, had half risen from the sofa, and was staring at her with large, bright, dreadful eyes.His hair hung in disorder on his forehead and his lips parted strangely.Horror, mingled with an anguish of tenderness, was expressed on his suddenly transfigured face."
"“埃琳娜！”他叫道，“我快不行了。”","‘Elena!’ he articulated, ‘I am dying.’"
"她尖叫一声，跪倒在地，扑到他的胸前。","She fell with a scream on her knees, and clung to his breast."
"“一切都结束了，”因萨罗夫重复道，“我要不行了……再见了，我可怜的女孩！再见了，我的祖国！”然后他又跌落到沙发上。","‘It’s all over,’ repeated Insarov: ‘I’m dying…Good-bye, my poor girl!good-bye, my country!’ and he fell backwards on to the sofa."
"埃琳娜冲出房外，开始大声呼救。一个侍者赶忙跑去叫医生。埃琳娜扑到因萨罗夫身上。","Elena rushed out of the room, began calling for help; a waiter ran for a doctor.Elena clung to Insarov."
"就在那时，门口出现了一个人的身影，他肩膀宽阔，皮肤黝黑，穿着一件肥大的起绒粗呢上衣，头戴着一顶低低的油布帽子。他困惑地站在那里一动不动。","At that instant in the doorway appeared a broad-shouldered, sunburnt man, in a stout frieze coat and a low oil-skin hat.He stood still in bewilderment."
"“伦迪奇！”埃琳娜喊道，“是您！看啊，看在上帝的份上，他病得很重！这到底是为什么？上帝啊！他昨天还出去过，他刚才还在跟我说话！”","‘Renditch!’ cried Elena, ‘it’s you!Look, for God’s sake, he’s ill!What’s wrong?Good God!He went out yesterday, he was talking to me just now.’"
"伦迪奇什么都没说，只是走到一边。一个个子矮小、头戴假发、架着一副眼镜的人从他身边跑过，这是位住在这个旅馆的医生。他朝因萨罗夫跑过去。","Renditch said nothing and only moved on one side.There slipped quickly past him a little figure in a wig and spectacles; it was a doctor living in the same hotel.He went up to Insarov."
"“女士，”很久之后他才说道，“这位国外的先生已经过世了——他已经走了——死因是动脉瘤和肺病并发症。","‘Signora,’ he said, after the lapse of a few minutes, ‘the foreign gentleman is dead—il Signore forestiere e morte—of aneurism in combination with disease of the lungs.’"

"第二天，还是在那个房间，伦迪奇站在窗户旁边。埃琳娜站在他的前面，紧紧地裹着一件披巾。在隔壁的房间中，因萨罗夫躺在灵柩中。埃琳娜的脸上露出恐惧和毫无生气的神色，两条深深的皱纹盘踞在两道眉毛之间，这使得她呆滞的眼神中流露出一种神情紧绷的感觉。窗户上摊着来自安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜的信。她希望自己的女儿能回到莫斯科，哪怕一个月也好。她向埃琳娜诉说着她的生活是多么地孤独，抱怨着尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的不是。她向因萨罗夫问好，询问他的健康状况，并且希望他能允许他的妻子回去。","The next day, in the same room, Renditch was standing at the window; before him, wrapped in a shawl, sat Elena.In the next room, Insarov lay in his coffin.Elena’s face was both scared and lifeless; two lines could be seen on her forehead between her eyebrows; they gave a strained expression to her fixed eyes.In the window lay an open letter from Anna Vassilyevna.She begged her daughter to come to Moscow if only for a month, complained of her loneliness, and of Nikolai Artemyevitch, sent greetings to Insarov, inquired after his health, and begged him to spare his wife."
"伦迪奇是达尔马提亚人，是个海员。因萨罗夫是在自己国家旅行时认识他的，到了威尼斯后，因萨罗夫又找到了他。他是个神情肃穆、脾气火暴、大胆无畏并愿意为斯拉夫民族的事业而献身的人。他瞧不起土耳其人并且憎恨奥地利人。","Renditch was a Dalmatian, a sailor, with whom Insarov had become acquainted during his wanderings in his own country, and whom he had sought out in Venice.He was a dry, gruff man, full of daring and devoted to the Slavonic cause.He despised the Turks and hated the Austrians."
"“您还要在威尼斯呆多久？”埃琳娜用意大利语问他。她的声音如同她的表情一样毫无生气。","‘How long must you remain at Venice?’Elena asked him in Italian.And her voice was as lifeless as her face."
"“因为要装货和避免别人的注意，我会在这里呆一天，然后就直奔扎拉。这个消息肯定会让乡亲们伤心不已。他们都期望他能回去。他们把所有的希望都寄托在他的身上。”","‘One day for freighting and not to rouse suspicions, and then straight to Zara.I shall have sad news for our countrymen.They have long been expecting him; they rested their hopes on him.’"
"“他们把所有的希望都寄托在他的身上。”埃琳娜机械地重复着。","‘They rested their hopes on him,’ Elena repeated mechanically."
"“您什么时候安葬他？”伦迪奇问道。","‘When will you bury him?’ asked Renditch."
"埃琳娜停了一会儿，回答：“明——天吧。”","Elena not at once replied, ‘To-morrow.’"
"“明天？我一定会去的，我要为他的墓地撒上一把土。然后也能帮帮您。但是，能让他长眠于斯拉夫的土地里就更好了。”","‘To-morrow?I will stop; I should like to throw a handful of earth into his grave.And you will want help.But it would have been better for him to lie in Slavonic earth.’"
"埃琳娜看了看伦迪奇。","Elena looked at Renditch."
"“船长，”她说道，“带上我和他，带我们到海的另一边去吧，离开这里。可以吗？”","‘Captain,’ she said, ‘take me and him and carry us across to the other side of the sea, away from here.Isn’t that possible?’"
"伦迪奇考虑了一下，说：“可以是可以，但势必会很艰难。我们要先跟这里那些该死的长官们谈谈。但假如我们把他埋葬在那里，我又怎么把您带回来呢？”","Renditch considered: ‘Possible certainly, but difficult.We shall have to come into collision with the damned authorities here.But supposing we arrange all that and bury him there, how am I to bring you back?’"
"“您不用把我带回来。”","‘You need not bring me back.’"
"“什么？那您要在什么地方安身呢？”","‘What?where will you stop?’"
"“我会为自己找个地方的。只要您带上我们，带上我。”","‘I shall find some place for myself; only take us, take me.’"
"伦迪奇抓了抓自己的后脑勺。","Renditch scratched the back of his head."
"“您最清楚不过了，这是非常困难的。我会去试试的，您在这等我两个小时。”","‘You know best; but it’s all very difficult.I will, I will try; and you expect me here in two hours’ time.’"
"他离开了。埃琳娜走进了隔壁那间屋子，靠在墙上，像石头一样呆呆地站在那里好久。然后她跪倒在地，但是她并没有祈祷。她的心中没有怨恨。她不敢责问上帝，问他为什么不饶恕、不可怜、不庇护，就算她有错，为什么要如此残酷地惩罚她。我们每个人只要活着都有罪。不论是伟大的思想家，还是造福于人民的伟人，都无法奢望自己因为自己的贡献而长生不死……埃琳娜依然没有祈祷，她仿佛化作了一块石头。","He went away.Elena passed into the next room, leaned against the wall, and for a long time stood there as though turned to stone.Then she dropped on her knees, but she could not pray.There was no reproach in her heart; she did not dare to question God’s will, to ask why He had not spared, pitied, saved, why He had punished her beyond her guilt, if she were guilty.Each of us is guilty by the fact that he lives; and there is no one so great a thinker, so great a benefactor of mankind that he might hope to have a right to live for the service he has done….Still Elena could not pray; she was a stone."
"那天夜里，一艘平底船从因萨罗夫住的旅馆离岸。船上坐着埃琳娜和伦迪奇，他们旁边是一个蒙着黑布的大箱子。他们行驶了大概一个小时，终于来到港口处一艘停泊着的双桅小船前面。埃琳娜和伦迪奇走到船上。水手们把灵柩扛了上去。午夜起了一阵暴风，但一大早，船就驶过了利多海湾。一整天，暴风猛烈地咆哮着，劳埃德船运公司那些有经验的水手们都晃着脑袋，预言情况不妙。威尼斯和的里雅斯特间的亚得里亚海和达尔马提亚海岸尤其危险。","The same night a broad-bottomed boat put off from the hotel where the Insarovs lived.In the boat sat Elena with Renditch and beside them stood a long box covered with a black cloth.They rowed for about an hour, and at last reached a small two-masted ship, which was riding at anchor at the very entrance of the harbour.Elena and Renditch got into the ship; the sailors carried in the box.At midnight a storm had arisen, but early in the morning the ship had passed out of the Lido.During the day the storm raged with fearful violence, and experienced seamen in Lloyd’s offices shook their heads and prophesied no good.The Adriatic Sea between Venice, Trieste, and the Dalmatian coast is particularly dangerous."
"埃琳娜从威尼斯离开的三个星期之后，安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜在莫斯科收到了一封信——","Three weeks after Elena’s departure from Vienna, Anna Vassilyevna received the following letter in Moscow:—"
"“我亲爱的父亲母亲——我要和你们说永别了。你们以后再也见不到我了。德米特里昨天过世了。对我来说一切都已经终结。今天我要带着他的遗体启程去扎拉。我要去安葬他，而我究竟会怎么样，我也不知道。但是现在只有德米特里的祖国才是我的祖国。那里的人民正在准备革命，正在为战争作准备。我要去当一个护理人员。我要去照料那些病患和伤员。我不知道我会变成什么样，但是即使德米特里死了，我也要继承他的遗志，完成他此生的事业。我已经会说保加利亚语和塞尔维亚语了。可能我真的没有力气再支撑更久了——这样更好。我已经被带到悬崖的边上，必须掉下去。难怪命运要把我们绑在一起，谁知道呢？也许是我害死了他，现在该他来找我，让我追随他而去了。我追寻幸福，但我找到的——可能是死亡。或许这是注定的结局，或许我有罪……但是死亡能弥补一切，调和一切，不是吗？请原谅我给你们带来的痛苦。我也无可奈何。可是我怎么能回去俄国？我回去干什么呢？","‘My DEAR PARENTS.—I am saying goodbye to you for ever.You will never see me again.Dmitri died yesterday.Everything is over for me.To-day I am setting off with his body to Zara.I will bury him, and what will become of me, I don’t know.But now I have no country but Dmitri’s country.There, they are preparing for revolution, they are getting ready for war.I will join the Sisters of Mercy; I will tend the sick and the wounded.I don’t know what will become of me, but even after Dmitri’s death, I will be faithful to his memory, to the work of his whole life.I have learnt Bulgarian and Servian.Very likely, I shall not have strength to live through it all for long—so much the better.I have been brought to the edge of the precipice and I must fall over.Fate did not bring us together for nothing; who knows?—perhaps I killed him; now it is his turn to draw me after him.I sought happiness, and I shall find—perhaps death.It seems it was to be thus: it seems it was a sin….But death covers all and reconciles all; does it not?Forgive me all the suffering I have caused you; it was not under my control.But how could I return to Russia; What have I to do in Russia?"
"“请接受我最后的亲吻和祝福，不要怪罪我。","‘Accept my last kisses and blessings, and do not condemn me."
"R.”","R.’"
"差不多五年过去了，再也没有埃琳娜的任何音信。所有的信件和问询都没有结果。合约缔结之后，尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇亲自动身去威尼斯和扎拉找她，也是白费功夫。在威尼斯，他了解到的是读者已经知道的那些事，而在扎拉，没有人知道任何关于伦迪奇和那艘船的信息。有不确切的传言说，几年前的一场大风暴之后，一口棺材被海水冲到岸上，里面装着一具男尸……但是根据其他更可信的传闻，这口棺材不是被海水冲上岸的，而是被一个从威尼斯来的外国夫人带来的，而且就埋葬在海岸边。有些人还补充说，他们后来在黑塞哥维那的驻军队伍中看到过这位夫人，他们甚至还仔细地描述了这位夫人的打扮，全身上下都是黑色的衣服。无论如何，埃琳娜的行踪永远彻底地消失了，没有人知道她是不是还活着，或者是隐居于某个地方，又或者是她的人生小剧已经落幕——她失去了生存的动力，被死神带走了。经常有这样的事情：一个人一觉醒来，以一种抑制不住的恐惧感问自己：“我已经三十……四十……五十岁了吗？时间怎么过得这么快？死亡怎么离我如此接近？”死神就如同渔夫，他把鱼捕到网中，然后把它们放回在水中一段时间，鱼仍然在游，但被网包围着，渔夫会把它捞起来——在他觉得适当的时候。","Nearly five years have passed since then, and no further news of Elena has come.All letters and inquiries were fruitless; in vain did Nikolai Artemyevitch himself make a journey to Venice and to Zara after peace was concluded.In Venice he learnt what is already known to the reader, but in Zara no one could give him any positive information about Renditch and the ship he had taken.There were dark rumours that some years back, after a great storm, the sea had thrown up on shore a coffin in which had been found a man’s body…But according to other more trustworthy accounts this coffin had not been thrown up by the sea at all, but had been carried over and buried near the shore by a foreign lady, coming from Venice; some added that they had seen this lady afterwards in Herzegovina, with the forces which were there assembled; they even described her dress, black from head to foot However it was, all trace of Elena had disappeared beyond recovery for ever; and no one knows whether she is still living, whether she is hidden away somewhere, or whether the petty drama of life is over—the little ferment of her existence is at an end; and she has found death in her turn.It happens at times that a man wakes up and asks himself with involuntary horror, ‘Can I be already thirty … forty… fifty?How is it life has passed so soon?How is it death has moved up so close?’Death is like a fisher who catches fish in his net and leaves them for a while in the water; the fish is still swimming but the net is round him, and the fisher will draw him up—when he thinks fit."
"这个故事中的其他人如今怎么样呢？","What became of the other characters of our story?"
"安娜·瓦西里耶夫娜仍然活着。在那次巨大的打击之后，她似乎一下子老了好几岁。她的抱怨少了，但是忧虑却增加了不少。尼古拉·阿尔捷米耶维奇的年纪也大了，头发也变得灰白，与奥古斯丁娜·克里斯蒂亚诺夫娜也彻底地分开了……他现在诅咒一切外国的事物。他的女管家是一个三十岁左右、漂亮的俄国女人，身穿丝绸连衣裙，戴着金戒指和耳环。库尔纳托夫斯基和所有性情激动的黑皮肤男人一样喜欢金发美女。他已经和卓娅结了婚。她对他唯命是从，甚至放弃了用德语思考的习惯。别尔谢涅夫在海德堡。他由政府资助被派到国外学习，曾到过柏林和巴黎。他没有荒废一点儿时间，已经成为了一个博学的教授。他的两篇文章《论古代法律在司法审判上的某些特点》和《论在文明进程中城市的意义》已经引起了很多学者的关注。然而唯一美中不足的是，这两篇文章的语言都比较晦涩难懂，运用外国词汇使文章大为减色。舒宾在罗马。他全身心地投入进艺术创作之中，而且被人们称为是年轻雕塑家中一颗璀璨的新星。一些苛刻的客人认为他对古代雕塑的研究过于浅薄，还没有自己的风格，并把他归类为法兰西学派。他从英国人和美国人那里接到了许多订单。最近一段时间，他的作品《酒神的女祭司》被大为谈论。一个很有名的有钱人，俄国伯爵博博什金，本想以一千斯库多的价钱买下它，结果却将三千斯库多给了一位纯正的法国雕塑家，买下了一组被称为《倒在青春之神的怀里为情自杀的农村少女》的群像。舒宾还时不时地给尤瓦·伊万诺维奇写信。只有尤瓦一点儿变化都没有。“您还记得，”他最近写信给尤瓦说，“我们知道埃琳娜结婚消息的那个晚上，我坐在您的床头跟您聊天时，您对我说的话吗？您还记得我曾经问过您‘我们之中会出现大人物吗？’您回答‘一定会有的。’天，太有远见了！那么现在，我从这个‘诗一般的国度’再次向您发问：‘尤瓦·伊万诺维奇，未来会是什么样子呢？’”","Anna Vassilyevna is still living; she has aged very much since the blow that has fallen on her; is less complaining, but far more wretched.Nikolai Artemyevitch, too, has grown older and greyer, and has parted from Augustina Christianovna…He has taken now to abusing everything foreign.His housekeeper, a handsome woman of thirty, a Russian, wears silk dresses and gold rings and bracelets.Kurnatovsky, like every man of ardent temperament and dark complexion, a devoted admirer of pretty blondes, married Zoya; she is in complete subjection to him and has even given up thinking in German.Bersenyev is in Heidelberg; he has been sent abroad at the expense of government; he has visited Berlin and Paris and is not wasting his time; he has become a thoroughly efficient professor.The attention of the learned public has been caught by his two articles: ‘On some peculiarities of ancient law as regards judicial sentences,’ and ‘On the significance of cities in civilisation.’It is only a pity that both articles are written in rather a heavy style, disfigured by foreign words.Shubin is in Rome; he is completely given up to his art and is reckoned one of the most remarkable and promising of young sculptors.Severe tourists consider that he has not sufficiently studied the antique, that he has ‘no style,’ and reckon him one of the French school; he has had a great many orders from the English and Americans.Of late, there has been much talk about a Bacchante of his; the Russian Count Boboshkin, the well-known millionaire, thought of buying it for one thousand scudi, but decided in preference to give three thousand to another sculptor, French pur sang, for a group entitled, ‘A youthful shepherdess dying for love in the bosom of the Genius of Spring.’Shubin writes from time to time to Uvar Ivanovitch, who alone has remained quite unaltered in all respects.‘Do you remember,’ he wrote to him lately, ‘what you said to me that night, when poor Elena’s marriage was made known, when I was sitting on your bed talking to you?Do you remember I asked you, “Will there ever be men among us?” and you answered “There will be.”O primeval force!And now from here in “my poetic distance,” I will ask you again: “What do you say, Uvar Ivanovitch, will there be?”’"
"尤瓦·伊万诺维奇弹了下手指，望着远方，眼睛里闪耀着谜一般的光芒。","Uvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers and fixed his enigmatical stare into the far distance."
