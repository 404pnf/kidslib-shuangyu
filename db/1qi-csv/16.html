		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在法院大楼里，梅尔文斯基的案子休庭时，法官和公诉人都聚在伊凡·叶果罗维奇·谢贝克的办公室里，开始聊有名的克拉索夫案。费多尔·瓦西里耶维奇坚持认为那不在他们的管辖之下，言辞激烈，伊凡·叶果罗维奇则坚持认为那正是在他们的管辖之下，而一开始并未加入讨论的彼得·伊凡内奇始终一言不发，只是翻阅着刚刚送来的《公报》。</td>
		<td class="en">During an interval in the Melvinski trial in the large building of the Law Courts the members and public prosecutor met in Ivan Egorovich Shebek’s private room, where the conversation turned on the celebrated Krasovski case.Fedor Vasilievich warmly maintained that it was not subject to their jurisdiction, Ivan Egorovich maintained the contrary, while Peter Ivanovich, not having entered into the discussion at the start, took no part in it but looked through the Gazette which had just been handed in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“先生们，”他说，“伊凡·伊里奇死了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Gentlemen,” he said, “Ivan Ilych has died!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不会吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You don’t say so!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这里，你自己来看。”彼得·伊凡内奇回答，把刚从印刷厂出来、墨迹未干的报纸递给费多尔·瓦西里耶维奇。黑框中间是这样一行字：“普拉斯柯菲雅·费多罗夫娜·高洛文娜在此沉痛告知众位亲属及朋友，我敬爱的夫君伊凡·伊里奇·高洛文法官已于一八八二年二月四日辞世。葬礼兹定于本周五下午一时举行。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here, read it yourself,” replied Peter Ivanovich, handing Fedor Vasilievich the paper still damp from the press.Surrounded by a black border were the words: “Praskovya Fedorovna Golovina, with profound sorrow, informs relatives and friends of the demise of her beloved husband Ivan Ilych Golovin, Member of the Court of Justice, which occurred on February the 4th of this year 1882.The funeral will take place on Friday at one o’clock in the afternoon.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伊凡·伊里奇是在座各位先生的同事，受到他们所有人的爱戴。他已经病了几个星期，据说是身患绝症。他的职位还为他保留着，但是大家猜测他死后，阿历克谢耶夫会接替他的位置，而文尼科夫或施塔别尔两人中有一人会接替阿历克谢耶夫的位置。所以，一听到伊凡·伊里奇的死讯，办公室里的各位先生首先想到的是可能发生在自己或熟人身上的人事变动和升迁。</td>
		<td class="en">Ivan Ilych had been a colleague of the gentlemen present and was liked by them all.He had been ill for some weeks with an illness said to be incurable.His post had been kept open for him, but there had been conjectures that in case of his death Alexeev might receive his appointment, and that either Vinnikov or Shtabel would succeed Alexeev.So on receiving the news of Ivan Ilych’s death the first thought of each of the gentlemen in that private room was of the changes and promotions it might occasion among themselves or their acquaintances.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我肯定能升到施塔别尔或文尼科夫的位置上去。”费多尔·瓦西里耶维奇想道，“很久以前就有人向我保证过了，这次要是能升官，就意味着每年除了津贴我还能多挣八百卢布。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I shall be sure to get Shtabel’s place or Vinnikov’s,” thought Fedor Vasilievich.“I was promised that long ago, and the promotion means an extra eight hundred rubles a year for me besides the allowance.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在我得申请把妻弟从卡卢加调过来。”彼得·伊凡内奇想道，“妻子肯定会非常高兴，这下她可再不能说我从来没帮过她家人了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now I must apply for my brother-in-law’s transfer from Kaluga,” thought Peter Ivanovich.“My wife will be very glad, and then she won’t be able to say that I never do anything for her relations.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我已经想到他这一病就再也下不了床了。”彼得·伊凡内奇大声说，“让人痛心疾首。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I thought he would never leave his bed again,” said Peter Ivanovich aloud.“It’s very sad.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是他到底患了什么病？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But what really was the matter with him?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“医生们也说不清——不管怎样，医生倒是说出他患的是什么病了，只是每个医生的说法都不一样。我最后一次见他的时候，还以为他好转了呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The doctors couldn’t say—at least they could, but each of them said something different.When last I saw him I though he was getting better.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“自从放了假我还没去看望过他。我一直都想去来着。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And I haven’t been to see him since the holidays.I always meant to go.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他有财产吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Had he any property?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想他妻子能有点——但有也是杯水车薪。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think his wife had a little—but something quiet trifling.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们得去看望她，可他们住得实在是太远了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“We shall have to go to see her, but they live so terribly far away.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“离你那儿远，你的意思是。你家离哪儿都远。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Far away from you, you mean.Everything’s far away from your place.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你瞧，他总是揪住我住在河对岸这一点不放。”彼得·伊凡内奇说，冲着谢贝克微笑。然后，大家又讨论了一会儿市里各处的远近距离，就回到了法庭上。</td>
		<td class="en">“You see, he never can forgive my living on the other side of the river,” said Peter Ivanovich, smiling at Shebek.Then, still talking of the distances between different parts of the city, they returned to the Court.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了考虑到伊凡·伊里奇的死可能导致的人事调动和升迁，这位大家熟识的同事的死讯，如同往常一样，还激起了听到这一消息的所有人心中沾沾自喜的感觉：“死的人是他不是我。”</td>
		<td class="en">Besides considerations as to the possible transfers and promotions likely to result from Ivan Ilych’s death, the mere fact of the death of a near acquaintance aroused, as usual, in all who heard of it the complacent feeling that, “it is he who is dead and not I.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每一个人或想到或感觉到：“还好，他死了，但是我还活着！”不过那些和伊凡·伊里奇走得更近的熟人，所谓他的朋友们，不禁还想到他们必须得不辞劳苦地参加葬礼、亲自慰问孀妇，这样才合乎礼数。</td>
		<td class="en">Each one thought or felt, “Well, he’s dead but I’m alive!”But the more intimate of Ivan Ilych’s acquaintances, his so-called friends, could not help thinking also that they would now have to fulfill the very tiresome demands of propriety by attending the funeral service and paying a visit of condolence to the widow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >费多尔·瓦西里耶维奇和彼得·伊凡内奇就是和伊凡走得最近的人。彼得·伊凡内奇和伊凡·伊里奇一起攻读法律，他认为自己受过伊凡的恩。</td>
		<td class="en">Fedor Vasilievich and Peter Ivanovich had been his nearest acquaintances.Peter Ivanovich had studied law with Ivan Ilych and had considered himself to be under obligations to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吃饭时，彼得·伊凡内奇告诉了妻子伊凡·伊里奇的死讯，以及有可能把她的弟弟调到他们这个区来的消息。饭后他没有像往常一样小憩，而是穿上礼服，乘着马车去了伊凡·伊里奇家。</td>
		<td class="en">Having told his wife at dinner time of Ivan Ilych’s death, and of his conjecture that it might be possible to get her brother transferred to their circuit, Peter Ivanovich sacrificed his usual nap, put on his evening clothes and drove to Ivan Ilych’s house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伊凡家门口停着一辆私人马车和两辆出租马车。楼下大厅靠近衣帽架的墙边立着一个棺材盖，上面覆着金色的布，饰以金线和金流苏，棺材盖用金属粉末擦得锃亮。两位穿着一身黑衣的女士正脱下她们的毛皮斗篷。彼得·伊凡内奇认出其中一位女士是伊凡·伊里奇的姐姐，但另一位他就不认识了。他的同事施瓦茨从楼上下来，但一看到彼得·伊凡内奇进屋，他就停下脚步，对他使了个眼色，好像在说：“伊凡·伊里奇把事情搞得一团糟——不像你和我。”</td>
		<td class="en">At the entrance stood a carriage and two cabs.Leaning against the wall in the hall downstairs near the cloak-stand was a coffin-lid covered with cloth of gold, ornamented with gold cord and tassels, that had been polished up with metal powder.Two ladies in black were taking off their fur cloaks.Peter Ivanovich recognized one of them as Ivan Ilych’s sister, but the other was a stranger to him.His colleague Schwartz was just coming downstairs, but on seeing Peter Ivanovich enter he stopped and winked at him, as if to say: “Ivan Ilych has made a mess of things—not like you and me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >施瓦茨的脸上留着英式的胡子，他瘦削的身材在礼服中显得优雅而肃穆，和他顽皮的性格形成对比，在这里则显现出一种奇特的滑稽感，反正彼得·伊凡内奇是这么认为的。</td>
		<td class="en">Schwartz’s face with his Piccadilly whiskers, and his slim figure in evening dress, had as usual an air of elegant solemnity which contrasted with the playfulness of his character and had a special piquancy here, or so it seemed to Peter Ivanovich.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得·伊凡内奇请女士们先走，自己慢慢地跟在她们身后上楼。施瓦茨没有下楼而是呆在原地不动，彼得·伊凡内奇立刻明白他是想安排今晚到哪里去打桥牌。女士们上楼进了孀妇的屋子，施瓦茨嘴唇严肃地抿着，两眼中却透出顽皮的神色，他动动眉毛，暗示尸体放置在右边的屋里。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Ivanovich allowed the ladies to precede him and slowly followed them upstairs.Schwartz did not come down but remained where he was, and Peter Ivanovich understood that he wanted to arrange where they should play bridge that evening.The ladies went upstairs to the widow’s room, and Schwartz with seriously compressed lips but a playful look in his eyes, indicated by a twist of his eyebrows the room to the right where the body lay.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这类场合中，彼得·伊凡内奇像其他人一样，进屋时感觉不确定他要做什么。他只知道，在这个时候，画十字是绝对没错的。但他不确定画十字的同时要不要鞠躬。于是他采取了一个折中的办法。一进屋子他就开始画十字，并做了一个细微的、很像鞠躬的动作。与此同时，在头和手臂的动作所允许的情况下，他还环视了屋子。两个年轻男子——似乎是伊凡·伊里奇的侄子，其中一个是高中学生——一面往屋外走，一面画着十字。一位老妪一动不动地站着，一位眉毛弯得厉害的女士正对她低声说着什么。一名精力充沛、决心坚定的诵经士穿着礼服大衣正在大声诵念着什么东西，带着一副不容置疑的表情。男管家的助手盖拉西姆，轻轻走到彼得·伊凡内奇前面，往地板上撒着什么东西。注意到这个，彼得·伊凡内奇立即闻到了一股淡淡的腐尸味。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Ivanovich, like everyone else on such occasions, entered feeling uncertain what he would have to do.All he knew was that at such times it is always safe to cross oneself.But he was not quite sure whether one should make obeisances while doing so.He therefore adopted a middle course.On entering the room he began crossing himself and made a slight movement resembling a bow.At the same time, as far as the motion of his head and arm allowed, he surveyed the room.Two young men—apparently nephews, one of whom was a high-school pupil—were leaving the room, crossing themselves as they did so.An old woman was standing motionless, and a lady with strangely arched eyebrows was saying something to her in a whisper.A vigorous, resolute Church Reader, in a frock-coat, was reading something in a loud voice with an expression that precluded any contradiction.The butler’s assistant, Gerasim, stepping lightly in front of Peter Ivanovich, was strewing something on the floor.Noticing this, Peter Ivanovich was immediately aware of a faint odour of a decomposing body.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上次彼得·伊凡内奇去拜访伊凡·伊里奇，就在书房里看到过盖拉西姆。伊凡·伊里奇尤其喜欢他，他的职责就是照顾生病的伊凡。</td>
		<td class="en">The last time he had called on Ivan Ilych, Peter Ivanovich had seen Gerasim in the study.Ivan Ilych had been particularly fond of him and he was performing the duty of a sick nurse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得·伊凡内奇继续画着十字，向着棺材、诵经士和角落里桌上的圣像之间的方向微微俯首。然后，他觉得手臂画十字的动作已经做了很久，才停下来开始打量尸体。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Ivanovich continued to make the sign of the cross slightly inclining his head in an intermediate direction between the coffin, the Reader, and the icons on the table in a corner of the room.Afterwards, when it seemed to him that this movement of his arm in crossing himself had gone on too long, he stopped and began to look at the corpse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >死人躺着，就像所有的死人那样躺着，沉甸甸的，僵硬的四肢陷进棺材的软垫里，枕在枕头上的头部永远低垂着。蜡黄的前额以死人特有的样子隆起，凹陷的太阳穴附近秃了好几块，凸起的鼻子几乎压住了上嘴唇。跟彼得·伊凡内奇上次见到的他相比，他的模样变化很大，变得更瘦了，但是，就像所有的死人一样，他的脸变得比活着时更好看，最重要的是，他变得比活着时更庄严。他脸上的表情像是在说，该做的他都做了，而且做得很到位。除了这个，他的表情还显示出对活人的责备和警告。这个警告在彼得·伊凡内奇看来不适用，或者至少是不适用于他的。他感到有些不舒服，因此迅速地又画了一个十字，转身走出门去——他意识到自己走得太匆忙、太不顾礼数。</td>
		<td class="en">The dead man lay, as dead men always lie, in a specially heavy way, his rigid limbs sunk in the soft cushions of the coffin, with the head forever bowed on the pillow.His yellow waxen brow with bald patches over his sunken temples was thrust up in the way peculiar to the dead, the protruding nose seeming to press on the upper lip.He was much changed and grown even thinner since Peter Ivanovich had last seen him, but, as is always the case with the dead, his face was handsomer and above all more dignified than when he was alive.The expression on the face said that what was necessary had been accomplished, and accomplished rightly.Besides this there was in that expression a reproach and a warning to the living.—This warning seemed to Peter Ivanovich out of place, or at least not applicable to him.He felt a certain discomfort and so he hurriedly crossed himself once more and turned and went out of the door—too hurriedly and too regardless of propriety, as he himself was aware.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >施瓦茨在隔壁的屋子里等他，两腿叉得很开，两手在背后把玩他的大礼帽。光是看到这个顽皮、衣冠楚楚且优雅的人，彼得·伊凡内奇就觉得精神为之一振。他觉得施瓦茨能够超脱所有这些事件，不会向任何阴郁的影响屈服。他那副神气像是在说，伊凡·伊里奇的丧事不能构成例会中断的理由——换言之，这一事件绝对不能阻止他今晚拆开一副新牌，然后在男仆往桌子上摆放新蜡烛的时候洗牌。事实上，根本就没有任何理由来假设这一事件会妨碍到他们愉快地度过今晚。的确，在彼得·伊凡内奇走过他身旁时，他把这句话低声告诉了彼得，提议他们应该聚在费多尔·瓦西里耶维奇家玩一盘。但是显然彼得·伊凡内奇命里注定今晚玩不了牌。普拉斯柯菲雅·费多罗夫娜是个身材矮胖的女人，尽管尽一切努力想减肥，却自肩膀以下越变越胖，她长着和刚才站在棺材边的女士一样弯得极其厉害的眉毛。她穿着一身黑，头上盖着蕾丝，和其他几位女士从她自己的屋子里走出来，带着她们到停放死尸的房间里，说：“马上就要开始礼拜仪式了。请进吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">Schwartz was waiting for him in the adjoining room with legs spread wide apart and both hands toying with his top-hat behind his back.The mere sight of that playful, well-groomed, and elegant figure refreshed Peter Ivanovich.He felt that Schwartz was above all these happenings and would not surrender to any depressing influences.His very look said that this incident of a church service for Ivan Ilych could not be a sufficient reason for infringing the order of the session—in other words, that it would certainly not prevent his unwrapping a new pack of cards and shuffling them that evening while a footman placed fresh candles on the table: in fact, that there was no reason for supposing that this incident would hinder their spending the evening agreeably.Indeed he said this in a whisper as Peter Ivanovich passed him, proposing that they should meet for a game at Fedor Vasilievich’s.But apparently Peter Ivanovich was not destined to play bridge that evening.Praskovya Fedorovna (a short, fat woman who despite all efforts to the contrary had continued to broaden steadily from her shoulders downwards and who had the same extraordinarily arched eyebrows as the lady who had been standing by the coffin), dressed all in black, her head covered with lace, came out of her own room with some other ladies, conducted them to the room where the dead body lay, and said: “The service will begin immediately.Please go in.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >施瓦茨微微鞠躬，站着不动，显然既不接受邀请，也不拒绝邀请。普拉斯柯菲雅·费多罗夫娜认出了彼得·伊凡内奇，叹了口气，走近他，握着他的手，说：“我知道你是伊凡·伊里奇的挚友……”然后注视着他，等待某种恰当的回应。彼得·伊凡内奇知道，就像刚才在屋子里画十字是正确无误的一样，这里他必须要做的就是握住她的手，叹气，然后说：“相信我……”于是他照做了，这么做的时候他觉得达到了理想的效果：双方都深受感动。</td>
		<td class="en">Schwartz, making an indefinite bow, stood still, evidently neither accepting nor declining this invitation.Praskovya Fedorovna recognizing Peter Ivanovich, sighed, went close up to him, took his hand, and said: “I know you were a true friend to Ivan Ilych...” and looked at him awaiting some suitable response.And Peter Ivanovich knew that, just as it had been the right thing to cross himself in that room, so what he had to do here was to press her hand, sigh, and say, “Believe me...”So he did all this and as he did it felt that the desired result had been achieved: that both he and she were touched.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“随我来。我想在礼拜仪式开始前跟你说点事。”孀妇说，“让我挎着你的手臂。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come with me. I want to speak to you before it begins,” said the widow. “Give me your arm.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得·伊凡内奇让她挎着，两人走进靠里的房间中，路上还碰到施瓦茨，他对彼得·伊凡内奇挤眉弄眼，表示对他的同情。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Ivanovich gave her his arm and they went to the inner rooms, passing Schwartz who winked at Peter Ivanovich compassionately.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们的桥牌玩不成了！要是我们找另外一个人玩牌你可别生气。你能脱身的时候也许还能加入我们。”他那顽皮的表情仿佛在这样说。</td>
		<td class="en">“That does for our bridge!Don’t object if we find another player.Perhaps you can cut in when you do escape,” said his playful look.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得·伊凡内奇叹气叹得更深沉、更沮丧，而普拉斯柯菲雅·费多罗夫娜则感激地抓紧了他的手臂。走到装饰着粉红色印花窗帘、点着昏暗的灯的客厅里，他们在桌旁坐下——她坐在沙发上，而彼得·伊凡内奇坐在一个矮睡榻上，这个睡塌里的弹簧在他的体重压迫下断断续续地弯曲。普拉斯柯菲雅·费多罗夫娜本想警告他换一个椅子坐，但觉得这样的警告与她现在所处的境地不协调，于是改变了主意。一坐到这个睡榻上，彼得·伊凡内奇就回忆起伊凡·伊里奇当初是怎样布置这间屋子的，还就粉色、带绿叶的印花窗帘询问过他的意见。整个房间摆满了家具和小装饰物，在普拉斯柯菲雅·费多罗夫娜向沙发走去的路上，桌子的边缘钩住了她的黑色披肩。彼得·伊凡内奇起身去把披肩从桌边解开，睡榻的弹簧从他的体重中解放出来，也弹起来，崩了他一下。孀妇开始自己解披肩，于是彼得·伊凡内奇又坐下来，把睡榻中反叛的弹簧压在身下。但是孀妇没有完全解开，彼得·伊凡内奇再次起身，睡榻也再次反弹，甚至嘎吱嘎吱地响。等这一切都结束了，她拿出一条干净的麻纱手绢，开始哭泣。披巾和跟睡榻斗争的插曲令彼得·伊凡内奇的感情冷静下来，他坐在那里，脸上一副阴郁的表情。这一尴尬的局面被伊凡·伊里奇的男管家索科洛夫打断，他进来报告说普拉斯柯菲雅·费多罗夫娜选中的那块公墓里的坟地价钱是两百卢布。她停止哭泣，然后用受害者的眼神注视着彼得·伊凡内奇，用法语说她的日子过得很艰难。彼得·伊凡内奇无声地打手势，表示他确信事实的确如此。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Ivanovich sighed still more deeply and despondently, and Praskovya Fedorovna pressed his arm gratefully.When they reached the drawing-room, upholstered in pink cretonne and lighted by a dim lamp, they sat down at the table—she on a sofa and Peter Ivanovich on a low pouffe, the springs of which yielded spasmodically under his weight.Praskovya Fedorovna had been on the point of warning him to take another seat, but felt that such a warning was out of keeping with her present condition and so changed her mind.As he sat down on the pouffe Peter Ivanovich recalled how Ivan Ilych had arranged this room and had consulted him regarding this pink cretonne with green leaves.The whole room was full of furniture and knick-knacks, and on her way to the sofa the lace of the widow’s black shawl caught on the edge of the table.Peter Ivanovich rose to detach it, and the springs of the pouffe, relieved of his weight, rose also and gave him a push.The widow began detaching her shawl herself, and Peter Ivanovich again sat down, suppressing the rebellious springs of the pouffe under him.But the widow had not quite freed herself and Peter Ivanovich got up again, and again the pouffe rebelled and even creaked.When this was all over she took out a clean cambric handkerchief and began to weep.The episode with the shawl and the struggle with the pouffe had cooled Peter Ivanovich’s emotions and he sat there with a sullen look on his face.This awkward situation was interrupted by Sokolov, Ivan Ilych’s butler, who came to report that the plot in the cemetery that Praskovya Fedorovna had chosen would cost two hundred rubles.She stopped weeping and, looking at Peter Ivanovich with the air of a victim, remarked in French that it was very hard for her.Peter Ivanovich made a silent gesture signifying his full conviction that it must indeed be so.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您请吸烟。”她用雅量而又悲伤的声音说，然后转身和索科洛夫讨论坟地的价钱。</td>
		<td class="en">“Please smoke,” she said in a magnanimous yet crushed voice, and turned to discuss with Sokolov the price of the plot for the grave.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得·伊凡内奇一面点上香烟，一面听她事无巨细地询问那座公墓里不同坟地的价钱，最后决定她要买哪一块。这个问题定下来后，她又指示索科洛夫要请到唱诗班。然后索科洛夫离开了房间。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Ivanovich while lighting his cigarette heard her inquiring very circumstantially into the prices of different plots in the cemetery and finally decide which she would take.When that was done she gave instructions about engaging the choir.Sokolov then left the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我现在要照看所有事。”她告诉彼得·伊凡内奇，把放在桌上的签名簿挪到一边。注意到他的烟灰危及到桌子，她立即递给他一个烟灰缸，并说道，“我认为要说我伤心过度，不能处理日常事务，是做作了。正相反，如果有任何事能——不说能安慰我，但是——能让我分心，那也就是打理他身后的所有事了。”她又掏出手绢，好像是要哭，但好像突然又控制住了情绪，她摆脱掉悲伤，开始镇定地说：“但是我想要跟你说点事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I look after everything myself,” she told Peter Ivanovich, shifting the albums that lay on the table; and noticing that the table was endangered by his cigarette-ash, she immediately passed him an ash-tray, saying as she did so: “I consider it an affectation to say that my grief prevents my attending to practical affairs.On the contrary, if anything can—I won’t say console me, but—distract me, it is seeing to everything concerning him.”She again took out her handkerchief as if preparing to cry, but suddenly, as if mastering her feeling, she shook herself and began to speak calmly.“But there is something I want to talk to you about.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得·伊凡内奇欠身鞠躬，尽量控制住睡榻里的弹簧，他一起身，弹簧就立即开始在他的身子下边颤动起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Ivanovich bowed, keeping control of the springs of the pouffe, which immediately began quivering under him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他在生命的最后几天里受了很多罪。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He suffered terribly the last few days.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他受了很多罪？”彼得·伊凡内奇说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did he?” said Peter Ivanovich.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，他可受大罪了！他不停地尖叫，不是一连几分钟不停，而是一连几个小时都不停。最后三天他一刻不停地尖叫。令人难以忍受。我都不知道自己是怎么熬过来的，隔着三间屋子你都能听见他的叫声。哦，我难受极了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, terribly!He screamed unceasingly, not for minutes but for hours.For the last three days he screamed incessantly.It was unendurable.I cannot understand how I bore it; you could hear him three rooms off.Oh, what I have suffered!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是不是一直都清醒着？”彼得·伊凡内奇问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is it possible that he was conscious all that time?” asked Peter Ivanovich.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，”她低声说，“直到最后一刻他都是清醒的。临终前一刻钟，他跟我们道别，还让我们把伏洛嘉带走。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” she whispered.“To the last moment.He took leave of us a quarter of an hour before he died, and asked us to take Volodya away.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他每天早九点起床，喝咖啡、读报纸，然后穿着军便装去法院。那里已经为他备好适合他的“挽具”，他可以立即套在身上：召见请愿者、在大法官法庭处理问题、主持诉讼案，以及出席公开庭和预备庭。在所有这些事中，关键是要排除一切节外生枝的事，这些事总是干预到公务的正常程序，人和人之间只能保持工作关系，并依法办事。举例而言，一个人可能想来打听某些消息。如果这事不在伊凡·伊里奇的管辖范围内，他就不会和这个人发生任何关系；但如果这个人在公务上确实找他有事，这件事又能在正式的公文上写明，他就会倾尽全力帮忙——在工作关系的基础上、在限制范围以内尽全力帮忙，帮忙的同时还维持着友好的人际关系，换言之，要尽到礼数。工作关系一结束，其他的关系也就结束了。伊凡·伊里奇有这种把公务和私生活分得清清楚楚的能力，而且已臻化境，凭借着长时间的历练和与生俱来的能力，他以大师的风范把这种能力发挥到一个相当的高度，甚至能允许他自己把人情和公务混在一起。他之所以允许自己这么做，是因为他感觉自己随时都能把人情扔在一边，恢复严格的公事公办的态度。而且，他做起来轻松、舒服、得体，甚至还很艺术。休庭期间，他抽烟、喝茶，聊点政治、社会热点、纸牌，但主要还是聊官场上的任命。他感觉自己就像是大师——就像首席小提琴师在乐队中精确地扮演好了他的角色——然后疲惫地回到家里，发现他的妻子和女儿出门去拜访别人，或者是别人来拜访她们，他的儿子则去了学校，或者是已经在家教的帮助下做完家庭作业，肯定正在复习高中的课程。一切都井井有条。饭后，如果没有人拜访他们，伊凡·伊里奇有时候会读本时下人们关注的书，然后到了晚上，就专心工作，也就是读读公文，对比证人们的证词，在法典中找到能应用的段落记录下来。这件工作既不无聊，也不有趣。也许他玩桥牌的时候，这件工作是无聊的，但如果玩不了桥牌，那么这件工作无论如何都比无所事事或跟他妻子坐在一起要好。伊凡·伊里奇的主要乐趣就是举办便宴，邀请有社会地位的人士来参加，而且就像他家的客厅和其他人家的客厅没有任何区别一样，他那些愉快的便宴也和其他人家举办的便宴没有任何区别。</td>
		<td class="en">He got up at nine, drank his coffee, read the paper, and then put on his undress uniform and went to the law courts.There the harness in which he worked had already been stretched to fit him and he donned it without a hitch: petitioners, inquiries at the chancery, the chancery itself, and the sittings public and administrative.In all this the thing was to exclude everything fresh and vital, which always disturbs the regular course of official business, and to admit only official relations with people, and then only on official grounds.A man would come, for instance, wanting some information.Ivan Ilych, as one in whose sphere the matter did not lie, would have nothing to do with him: but if the man had some business with him in his official capacity, something that could be expressed on officially stamped paper, he would do everything, positively everything he could within the limits of such relations, and in doing so would maintain the semblance of friendly human relations, that is, would observe the courtesies of life.As soon as the official relations ended, so did everything else.Ivan Ilych possessed this capacity to separate his real life from the official side of affairs and not mix the two, in the highest degree, and by long practice and natural aptitude had brought it to such a pitch that sometimes, in the manner of a virtuoso, he would even allow himself to let the human and official relations mingle.He let himself do this just because he felt that he could at any time he chose resume the strictly official attitude again and drop the human relation.And he did it all easily, pleasantly, correctly, and even artistically.In the intervals between the sessions he smoked, drank tea, chatted a little about politics, a little about general topics, a little about cards, but most of all about official appointments.Tired, but with the feelings of a virtuoso—one of the first violins who has played his part in an orchestra with precision—he would return home to find that his wife and daughter had been out paying calls, or had a visitor, and that his son had been to school, had done his homework with his tutor, and was surely learning what is taught at High Schools.Everything was as it should be.After dinner, if they had no visitors, Ivan Ilych sometimes read a book that was being much discussed at the time, and in the evening settled down to work, that is, read official papers, compared the depositions of witnesses, and noted paragraphs of the Code applying to them.This was neither dull nor amusing.It was dull when he might have been playing bridge, but if no bridge was available it was at any rate better than doing nothing or sitting with his wife.Ivan Ilych’s chief pleasure was giving little dinners to which he invited men and women of good social position, and just as his drawing-room resembled all other drawing-rooms so did his enjoyable little parties resemble all other such parties.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The pleasures connected with his work were pleasures of ambition; his social pleasures were those of vanity; but Ivan Ilych’s greatest pleasure was playing bridge.He acknowledged that whatever disagreeable incident happened in his life, the pleasure that beamed like a ray of light above everything else was to sit down to bridge with good players, not noisy partners, and of course to four-handed bridge (with five players it was annoying to have to stand out, though one pretended not to mind), to play a clever and serious game (when the cards allowed it) and then to have supper and drink a glass of wine.After a game of bridge, especially if he had won a little (to win a large sum was unpleasant), Ivan Ilych went to bed in a specially good humour.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But this discomfort increased and, though not exactly painful, grew into a sense of pressure in his side accompanied by ill humour.And his irritability became worse and worse and began to mar the agreeable, easy, and correct life that had established itself in the Golovin family.Quarrels between husband and wife became more and more frequent, and soon the ease and amenity disappeared and even the decorum was barely maintained.Scenes again became frequent, and very few of those islets remained on which husband and wife could meet without an explosion.Praskovya Fedorovna now had good reason to say that her husband’s temper was trying.With characteristic exaggeration she said he had always had a dreadful temper, and that it had needed all her good nature to put up with it for twenty years.It was true that now the quarrels were started by him.His bursts of temper always came just before dinner, often just as he began to eat his soup.Sometimes he noticed that a plate or dish was chipped, or the food was not right, or his son put his elbow on the table, or his daughter’s hair was not done as he liked it, and for all this he blamed Praskovya Fedorovna.At first she retorted and said disagreeable things to him, but once or twice he fell into such a rage at the beginning of dinner that she realized it was due to some physical derangement brought on by taking food, and so she restrained herself and did not answer, but only hurried to get the dinner over.She regarded this self-restraint as highly praiseworthy.Having come to the conclusion that her husband had a dreadful temper and made her life miserable, she began to feel sorry for herself, and the more she pitied herself the more she hated her husband.She began to wish he would die; yet she did not want him to die because then his salary would cease.And this irritated her against him still more.She considered herself dreadfully unhappy just because not even his death could save her, and though she concealed her exasperation, that hidden exasperation of hers increased his irritation also.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">That month he went to see another celebrity, who told him almost the same as the first had done but put his questions rather differently, and the interview with this celebrity only increased Ivan Ilych’s doubts and fears.A friend of a friend of his, a very good doctor, diagnosed his illness again quite differently from the others, and though he predicted recovery, his questions and suppositions bewildered Ivan Ilych still more and increased his doubts.A homeopathist diagnosed the disease in yet another way, and prescribed medicine which Ivan Ilych took secretly for a week.But after a week, not feeling any improvement and having lost confidence both in the former doctor’s treatment and in this one’s, he became still more despondent.One day a lady acquaintance mentioned a cure effected by a wonder-working icon.Ivan Ilych caught himself listening attentively and beginning to believe that it had occurred.This incident alarmed him.“Has my mind really weakened to such an extent?” he asked himself.“Nonsense!It’s all rubbish.I mustn’t give way to nervous fears but having chosen a doctor must keep strictly to his treatment.That is what I will do.Now it’s all settled.I won’t think about it, but will follow the treatment seriously till summer, and then we shall see.From now there must be no more of this wavering!” this was easy to say but impossible to carry out.The pain in his side oppressed him and seemed to grow worse and more incessant, while the taste in his mouth grew stranger and stranger.It seemed to him that his breath had a disgusting smell, and he was conscious of a loss of appetite and strength.There was no deceiving himself: something terrible, new, and more important than anything before in his life, was taking place within him of which he alone was aware.Those about him did not understand or would not understand it, but thought everything in the world was going on as usual.That tormented Ivan Ilych more than anything.He saw that his household, especially his wife and daughter who were in a perfect whirl of visiting, did not understand anything of it and were annoyed that he was so depressed and so exacting, as if he were to blame for it.Though they tried to disguise it he saw that he was an obstacle in their path, and that his wife had adopted a definite line in regard to his illness and kept to it regardless of anything he said or did.Her attitude was this: “You know,” she would say to her friends, “Ivan Ilych can’t do as other people do, and keep to the treatment prescribed for him.One day he’ll take his drops and keep strictly to his diet and go to bed in good time, but the next day unless I watch him he’ll suddenly forget his medicine, eat sturgeon—which is forbidden—and sit up playing cards till one o’clock in the morning.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了谎言，或者因为这个谎言，伊凡·伊里奇认为，最折磨他的就是没有人能如他所希望的那样去怜悯他。在长期遭受痛苦后的某些时刻里，他最希望（虽然让他承认他会很惭愧）有人能像怜悯一个生病的小孩那样怜悯他。他渴望有人宠他、安慰他。他知道他是一名重要的官员，而且胡须花白，所以他所渴望的事是不可能的，但他依旧渴望得到。而在盖拉西姆对他的态度中，有一些东西和他所希望得到的相似，所以那种态度安慰了他。伊凡·伊里奇想哭泣，想有人宠他，想大哭。这时他的同事谢贝克来了，伊凡·伊里奇不仅没有哭，也不要人宠他，反而佯装成严肃、严厉、深奥的样子，习惯性地表达他对复审决定的意见，还固执地坚持自己的观点。他周围的虚伪和他自己的虚伪比其他任何事都更厉害地荼毒着他最后的日子。</td>
		<td class="en">Apart from this lying, or because of it, what most tormented Ivan Ilych was that no one pitied him as he wished to be pitied.At certain moments after prolonged suffering he wished most of all (though he would have been ashamed to confess it) for someone to pity him as a sick child is pitied.He longed to be petted and comforted.He knew he was an important functionary, that he had a beard turning grey, and that therefore what he longed for was impossible, but still he longed for it.And in Gerasim’s attitude towards him there was something akin to what he wished for, and so that attitude comforted him.Ivan Ilych wanted to weep, wanted to be petted and cried over, and then his colleague Shebek would come, and instead of weeping and being petted, Ivan Ilych would assume a serious, severe, and profound air, and by force of habit would express his opinion on a decision of the Court of Cassation and would stubbornly insist on that view.This falsity around him and within him did more than anything else to poison his last days.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Latterly during the loneliness in which he found himself as he lay facing the back of the sofa, a loneliness in the midst of a populous town and surrounded by numerous acquaintances and relations but that yet could not have been more complete anywhere—either at the bottom of the sea or under the earth—during that terrible loneliness Ivan Ilych had lived only in memories of the past.Pictures of his past rose before him one after another.They always began with what was nearest in time and then went back to what was most remote—to his childhood—and rested there.If he thought of the stewed prunes that had been offered him that day, his mind went back to the raw shrivelled French plums of his childhood, their peculiar flavour and the flow of saliva when he sucked their stones, and along with the memory of that taste came a whole series of memories of those days: his nurse, his brother, and their toys.“No, I mustn’t think of that…It is too painful,” Ivan Ilych said to himself, and brought himself back to the present—to the button on the back of the sofa and the creases in its morocco.“Morocco is expensive, but it does not wear well: there had been a quarrel about it.It was a different kind of quarrel and a different kind of morocco that time when we tore father’s portfolio and were punished, and mamma brought us some tarts…”And again his thoughts dwelt on his childhood, and again it was painful and he tried to banish them and fix his mind on something else.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Then again together with that chain of memories another series passed through his mind—of how his illness had progressed and grown worse.There also the further back he looked the more life there had been.There had been more of what was good in life and more of life itself.The two merged together.“Just as the pain went on getting worse and worse, so my life grew worse and worse,” he thought.“There is one bright spot there at the back, at the beginning of life, and afterwards all becomes blacker and blacker and proceeds more and more rapidly—in inverse ration to the square of the distance from death,” thought Ivan Ilych.And the example of a stone falling downwards with increasing velocity entered his mind.Life, a series of increasing sufferings, flies further and further towards its end—the most terrible suffering.“I am flying…”He shuddered, shifted himself, and tried to resist, but was already aware that resistance was impossible, and again with eyes weary of gazing but unable to cease seeing what was before them, he stared at the back of the sofa and waited—awaiting that dreadful fall and shock and destruction.</td></tr>
