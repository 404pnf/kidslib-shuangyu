		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我再也不觉得斯蒂芬·麦凯是个不错的人了，尽管我过去非常信赖他。我知道在那些日子里，我爱他远胜于爱我自己的兄弟。倘若我再次遇到斯蒂芬·麦凯的话，我可不会对自己的行为负责了。　我实在不明白，一个和我分享食物、同盖一条毯子、一起驾着狗拉的雪橇越过奇尔库特小道的人，竟然做出这种事情。我一直认为史蒂夫是个正直的人，一个友好的伙伴，他的天性中不掺杂一丝仇恨和恶意。我再也不相信自己对人的判断力了。哎，我曾照顾他，使他从伤寒症中痊愈；我们在斯图尔特河的上游一起挨饿；他也在小萨蒙湖救过我的命。而现在，一起相处了这么多年之后，对于斯蒂芬·麦凯，我唯一可说的就是他是我见过的最卑劣的人了。</td>
		<td class="en">I don’t think much of Stephen Mackaye any more, though I used to swear by him.I know that in those days I loved him more than my own brother.If ever I meet Stephen Mackaye again, I shall not be responsible for my actions.It passes beyond me that a man with whom I shared food and blanket, and with whom I mushed over the Chilcoot Trail, should turn out the way he did.I always sized Steve up as a square man, a kindly comrade, without an iota of anything vindictive or malicious in his nature.I shall never trust my judgment in men again.Why, I nursed that man through typhoid fever; we starved together on the headwaters of the Stewart; and he saved my life on the Little Salmon.And now, after the years we were together, all I can say of Stephen Mackaye is that he is the meanest man I ever knew.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们是在1897年秋季淘金潮的时候前往克朗代克的。由于出发得太晚，我们没能在封冻期之前通过奇尔库特关口。走过一段路后，开始下雪了，我们把装备打包背了起来。然后，我们不得不买些雪橇狗，以便在后面的路上用雪橇运这些装备。我们就是这样得到那只斑点狗的。狗的价格很高，我们花了110美金才买下了它。它看起来值这个价。我说“看起来”，是因为它是我见过的最健壮的狗了。它重六十磅，并且拥有优等雪橇狗的所有外形特征。我们从来没弄清它的品种。它不是爱斯基摩犬，不是阿拉斯加雪橇犬，也不是哈德孙湾犬；它看起来具有所有这些狗的特点，然而又不同于它们中的任何一种；此外，它有着白人所饲养的狗的特点，它的身体大部分都是掺着赤色、棕色、黄色的土白色，在身体的一侧，有一片如水桶一样大的墨黑色。　这就是我们叫它斑点狗的原因。</td>
		<td class="en">We started for the Klondike in the fall rush of 1897, and we started too late to get over Chilcoot Pass before the freeze-up.We packed our outfit on our backs part way over, when the snow began to fly, and then we had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way.That was how we came to get that Spot.Dogs were high, and we paid one hundred and ten dollars for him.He looked worth it.I say LOOKED, because he was one of the finest-appearing dogs I ever saw.He weighed sixty pounds, and he had all the lines of a good sled animal.We never could make out his breed.He wasn’t husky, nor Malemute, nor Hudson Bay; he looked like all of them and he didn’t look like any of them; and on top of it all he had some of the white man’s dog in him, for on one side, in the thick of the mixed yellow-brown-red-and-dirty-white that was his prevailing colour, there was a spot of coal-black as big as a water-bucket.That was why we called him Spot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它看上去的确不错。当它状态好的时候，浑身的肌肉都会凸起来。它是我在阿拉斯加见过的最健壮的狗，也是看起来最机灵的。你扫视它一眼，就会觉得它能拉得动三只像自己那么重的狗。估计它拉得动，不过我从没见过。它的聪明可不用在那方面。它偷粮食、藏粮食的本领堪称一流；一旦有了目标，打算偷偷摸摸地行动时，它就展现出极为可怕的预测本能；对于迷路后再次找到路，它非常有灵感。可一到了干活的时候，那些小聪明就从它身上一滴滴地流走，它就只是一块颤巍巍、傻乎乎的浆糊而已，那样子真叫你的心流血。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a good looker all right.When he was in condition his muscles stood out in bunches all over him.And he was the strongest-looking brute I ever saw in Alaska, also the most intelligent-looking.To run your eyes over him, you’d think he could outpull three dogs of his own weight.Maybe he could, but I never saw it.His intelligence didn’t run that way.He could steal and forage to perfection; he had an instinct that was positively gruesome for divining when work was to be done and for making a sneak accordingly; and for getting lost and not staying lost he was nothing short of inspired.But when it came to work, the way that intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of wobbling, stupid jelly would make your heart bleed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可有时候我觉得它并不傻。也许它就像我认识的一些人一样，太聪明了，不想干活。如果说它的小聪明把我们全都骗了的话，我一点儿也不会吃惊。也许它发现并认定了，不干活、不时地挨几下鞭子要比一直干活、不挨鞭子好得多。打这个小算盘，对它来说可是小菜一碟。告诉你吧，我曾坐下来直视那只狗的眼睛，直看得整个脊背直发抖，脊髓像酵母一样蔓延开来。我看见智慧一样的东西从里面照射出来。我说不清楚那是种什么样的智慧。这是语言所难以表达的。我见到过，就是这样。有时，看着这只狗的眼睛就如同凝视一个人的灵魂一样，从这只狗的眼睛里看到的东西使我感到恐惧，并让我想起了各种有关灵魂转世的说法以及其它的一切。告诉你，在那畜生的眼睛里，我觉察到了某种强大的东西。它的眼睛里有种讯息，可是我不够强大，捕捉不到。不管那是什么（我知道我在愚弄我自己)——不管是什么，它都使我感到困惑。我也说不清楚在那畜生眼里看到的到底是什么；那不是光，不是色彩；而是一种来回移动的东西，而眼睛本身却并没有动。我想我并没看见它动，我只是感觉得它在动。只是一种表情——就是如此——这就是我对它的印象。不；它不仅仅是种表情；这其中另有深意。我不知道那是什么，但它却给我一种血缘相同的感觉。哦，不，不是情感上的血缘关系。而是，一种平等的血缘关系。那双眼睛从来不会像鹿的眼睛一样恳求。它们充满挑战。不，还不是挑衅。那不过是一种镇静的对于平等的设想而已。我认为它并不是故意这样的。我相信它是无意识的。那东西在那里，是因为它本身就在那里，不由自主地就从眼睛里照射了出来。不，我不是指发光。它并没有发光，它在移动。我知道我现在满口胡言，但如果你曾像我一样直视那畜生的眼睛，你就会明白了。史蒂夫和我有同感。哎，有一次我试着要杀那只斑点狗——它真是一点用都没有；但我却失败了。我把它引出来带到灌木林里，它慢吞吞地、极不情愿地跟着我走。它知道要发生什么。我在一个合适的地方停了下来，脚踩到绳子上，拔出了我的大科尔特左轮手枪。那只狗坐了下来，看着我。我告诉你,它并没有乞怜。它只是看着你。然后我就看见各种各样令人费解的东西在它那双眼睛里移动，是的，在动，。我并没有真的看见它们在动；我觉得我看到了，是因为，正如我之前所说，我想我只是感觉到了。我现在想说的是，我无法理解那是什么。这就像处死一个神志清醒的勇者，他平静地看着你的枪，好像在说：“谁怕啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">There are times when I think it wasn’t stupidity.Maybe, like some men I know, he was too wise to work.I shouldn’t wonder if he put it all over us with that intelligence of his.Maybe he figured it all out and decided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot better than work all the time and no licking.He was intelligent enough for such a computation.I tell you, I’ve sat and looked into that dog’s eyes till the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like yeast, what of the intelligence I saw shining out.I can’t express myself about that intelligence.It is beyond mere words.I saw it, that’s all.At times it was like gazing into a human soul, to look into his eyes; and what I saw there frightened me and started all sorts of ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest.I tell you I sensed something big in that brute’s eyes; there was a message there, but I wasn’t big enough myself to catch it.Whatever it was (I know I’m making a fool of myself)—whatever it was, it baffled me.I can’t give an inkling of what I saw in that brute’s eyes; it wasn’t light, it wasn’t colour; it was something that moved, away back, when the eyes themselves weren’t moving.And I guess I didn’t see it move either; I only sensed that it moved.It was an expression—that’s what it was—and I got an impression of it.No; it was different from a mere expression; it was more than that.I don’t know what it was, but it gave me a feeling of kinship just the same.Oh, no, not sentimental kinship.It was, rather, a kinship of equality.Those eyes never pleaded like a deer’s eyes.They challenged.No, it wasn’t defiance.It was just a calm assumption of equality.And I don’t think it was deliberate.My belief is that it was unconscious on his part.It was there because it was there, and it couldn’t help shining out.No, I don’t mean shine.It didn’t shine; it MOVED.I know I’m talking rot, but if you’d looked into that animal’s eyes the way I have, you’d understand.Steve was affected the same way I was.Why, I tried to kill that Spot once—he was no good for anything; and I fell down on it.I led him out into the brush, and he came along slow and unwilling.He knew what was going on.I stopped in a likely place, put my foot on the rope, and pulled my big Colt’s.And that dog sat down and looked at me.I tell you he didn’t plead.He just looked.And I saw all kinds of incomprehensible things moving, yes, MOVING, in those eyes of his.I didn’t really see them move; I thought I saw them, for, as I said before, I guess I only sensed them.And I want to tell you right now that it got beyond me.It was like killing a man, a conscious, brave man, who looked calmly into your gun as much as to say, “Who’s afraid?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而且，就在那种讯息离我这么近的时候，我没有迅速扣动扳机，而是停下来看自己是否能够捕捉到那讯息。就在那，就在我的面前，有什么东西在它的那双眼睛里微微地发着光。然而为时已晚。我害怕了。我浑身颤抖，胃里一阵强烈的痉挛，使我恶心难忍。我干脆坐下来，看着那狗，它也看着我，直到我觉得自己快要发疯了。你想知道我做了些什么吗？我扔掉枪、带着心中对上帝的敬畏跑回了营地。史蒂夫嘲笑了我。但我注意到，一个星期后，史蒂夫也带着一样的目的把斑点狗领进了树林。他也独自回来了，过了一会儿，斑点狗也慢悠悠地回来了。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, too, the message seemed so near that, instead of pulling the trigger quick, I stopped to see if I could catch the message.There it was, right before me, glimmering all around in those eyes of his.And then it was too late.I got scared.I was trembly all over, and my stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me seasick.I just sat down and looked at the dog, and he looked at me, till I thought I was going crazy.Do you want to know what I did?I threw down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of God in my heart.Steve laughed at me.But I notice that Steve led Spot into the woods, a week later, for the same purpose, and that Steve came back alone, and a little later Spot drifted back, too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >无论如何，斑点狗都不肯干活。我们在它身上花了110美元，几乎掏空了腰包，它却不肯干活。它甚至连缰绳都不肯拉。我们第一次给它套上挽具的时候，史蒂夫对它说话，它有点发抖，仅此而已。它一步也不迈。它就那样颤抖地、一动不动地站着，像极了一团浆糊。史蒂夫用鞭子抽它。它大叫起来，却仍然一动不动。史蒂夫更用力地又抽了它一下，它嗥叫起来——是那种常见的狼的长嚎声。接着史蒂夫发火了，又抽了它六下，我急忙从帐篷里跑了出来。</td>
		<td class="en">At any rate, Spot wouldn’t work.We paid a hundred and ten dollars for him from the bottom of our sack, and he wouldn’t work.He wouldn’t even tighten the traces.Steve spoke to him the first time we put him in harness, and he sort of shivered, that was all.Not an ounce on the traces.He just stood still and wobbled, like so much jelly.Steve touched him with the whip.He yelped, but not an ounce.Steve touched him again, a bit harder, and he howled—the regular long wolf howl.Then Steve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and I came on the run from the tent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我告诉史蒂夫他对它太野蛮了，我们因此吵了一架——这是我们第一次吵架。他把鞭子扔进雪里便气冲冲地走了。我捡起鞭子，向斑点狗走去。我还没扬起鞭子时，那只斑点狗就颤抖起来，畏缩着。刚挨了第一下，它就像个亡灵一样哀嚎起来。然后它就倒在雪里了。我开始发动其余的狗，我用鞭子抽它的时候，它们就拖着它向前走。它翻着身仰面向上，一路颠簸着前行，四条腿在空中乱扑腾，像是要通过绞肉机似的嚎叫着。史蒂夫回来嘲笑了我，我也为自己说过的话向他道歉。</td>
		<td class="en">I told Steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some words—the first we’d ever had.He threw the whip down in the snow and walked away mad.I picked it up and went to it.That Spot trembled and wobbled and cowered before ever I swung the lash, and with the first bite of it he howled like a lost soul.Next he lay down in the snow.I started the rest of the dogs, and they dragged him along while I threw the whip into him.He rolled over on his back and bumped along, his four legs waving in the air, himself howling as though he was going through a sausage machine.Steve came back and laughed at me, and I apologized for what I’d said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那只斑点狗还是什么活都不干；更要命的是，它是我见过的最贪吃的狗,像猪一样。不仅如此，它还是个最聪明的小偷。这可没冤枉它。许多顿早餐我们吃不到腌肉，是因为斑点狗已经捷足先登了。也是因为它，我们在斯图尔特河上游差点儿饿死。它找到了藏肉的地方，它吃饱了剩下的，也被其余的狗吃了。但它也很公正。每个人它都偷。它是一只不安宁的狗，总是四处窥探，要么就跑到什么地方去。五英里之内的营地，没有它没突袭过的。最糟糕的是，那些人还让我们为它掏伙食费，这地方的法律就是如此；但这对我们来说实在是太残酷了，尤其是我们在奇尔库特的第一个冬天，赔偿那些没吃到嘴的火腿和腌肉，让我们破了产。那只斑点狗还很会打架。它除了干活什么都行。它从没拉过一磅重的东西，却是整个团队的头领。它让那些狗都听从它的办法真是门学问。它欺负它们，常常有一只或几只狗身上有它刚咬过的牙印。但它不仅仅是一个恃强凌弱者。任何四条腿走路的动物它都不怕；我曾见过它在没有受到任何挑衅的情况下，单枪匹马地冲入一支陌生的队伍，把整个队伍搅乱。我是不是说过它很能吃？有次，我撞见它在吃鞭子。这可是真话。它从鞭梢开始，当我撞见它的时候，它已经吃到把手了，而且仍然在吃。</td>
		<td class="en">There was no getting any work out of that Spot; and to make up for it, he was the biggest pig-glutton of a dog I ever saw.On top of that, he was the cleverest thief.There was no circumventing him.Many a breakfast we went without our bacon because Spot had been there first.And it was because of him that we nearly starved to death up the Stewart.He figured out the way to break into our meat-cache, and what he didn’t eat, the rest of the team did.But he was impartial.He stole from everybody.He was a restless dog, always very busy snooping around or going somewhere.And there was never a camp within five miles that he didn’t raid.The worst of it was that they always came back on us to pay his board bill, which was just, being the law of the land; but it was mighty hard on us, especially that first winter on the Chilcoot, when we were busted, paying for whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate.He could fight, too, that Spot.He could do everything but work.He never pulled a pound, but he was the boss of the whole team.The way he made those dogs stand around was an education.He bullied them, and there was always one or more of them fresh-marked with his fangs.But he was more than a bully.He wasn’t afraid of anything that walked on four legs; and I’ve seen him march, single-handed into a strange team, without any provocation whatever, and put the kibosh on the whole outfit.Did I say he could eat?I caught him eating the whip once.That’s straight.He started in at the lash, and when I caught him he was down to the handle, and still going.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但它是只长得不错的狗。第一个星期末，我们以七十五美金的价格把它卖给了骑警队。他们有经验丰富的赶狗人，我们确信，经过六百英里的路程到达道森的时候，它一定会成为一个出色的雪橇狗。我说我们确信，是因为我们只是刚开始了解那只斑点狗。没过多久，我们就不急着知道关于它的事情了。一个星期后的早晨，我们被该死的狗打架的声音吵醒了。是那只斑点狗回来整顿雪橇狗的队伍了。确切地说，我们吃了顿令人沮丧的早餐；但之后我们把它卖给一个往道森送政府快件的公务邮递员时，却高兴了两个小时。仅仅过了三天，那只斑点狗就回来了，而且像往常一样，打闹一通来庆祝它的回归。</td>
		<td class="en">But he was a good looker.At the end of the first week we sold him for seventy-five dollars to the Mounted Police.They had experienced dog-drivers, and we knew that by the time he’d covered the six hundred miles to Dawson he’d be a good sled-dog.I say we KNEW, for we were just getting acquainted with that Spot.A little later we were not brash enough to know anything where he was concerned.A week later we woke up in the morning to the dangdest dog-fight we’d ever heard.It was that Spot come back and knocking the team into shape.We ate a pretty depressing breakfast, I can tell you; but cheered up two hours afterward when we sold him to an official courier, bound in to Dawson with government despatches.That Spot was only three days in coming back, and, as usual, celebrated his arrival with a roughhouse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在冬天和春天的时间里，我们把自己的装备运过关口，又运送了其他人的装备，大赚了一笔。而且，我们从那只斑点狗身上也挣了不少钱。如果我们能卖它一次，就能卖它二十次。它常常跑回来，也没人要回他们的钱。我们并不想要这个钱。谁能从我们手中把它永远领走，我们会慷慨地付上一笔的。我们必须摆脱它，而且不能把它送人，因为那会引起怀疑。但它看起来实在不错，我们总能毫不费力地卖掉它。“完好无损。”我们这么说，那些人愿意为它出任何原价。我们最低卖过25美元，还有一次卖了150美元。那个不寻常的当事人亲自把它送了回来，拒绝拿回自己的钱，还把我们臭骂了一顿。他说花这个价钱跟我们说他是怎么想我们的真是物有所值；我们觉得他说的在理，也就没反驳。直至今日，我还没有完全找回在那人责备我之前自己过去的全部自尊。</td>
		<td class="en">We spent the winter and spring, after our own outfit was across the pass, freighting other people’s outfits; and we made a fat stake.Also, we made money out of Spot.If we sold him once, we sold him twenty times.He always came back, and no one asked for their money.We didn’t want the money.We’d have paid handsomely for any one to take him off our hands for keeps.We had to get rid of him, and we couldn’t give him away, for that would have been suspicious.But he was such a fine looker that we never had any difficulty in selling him.“Unbroke,” we’d say, and they’d pay any old price for him.We sold him as low as twenty-five dollars, and once we got a hundred and fifty for him.That particular party returned him in person, refused to take his money back, and the way he abused us was something awful.He said it was cheap at the price to tell us what he thought of us; and we felt he was so justified that we never talked back.But to this day I’ve never quite regained all the old self-respect that was mine before that man talked to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当湖里和河里的冰融化后，我们把装备放到本尼特湖区的一条船上，动身前往道森。我们有一队很棒的雪橇狗，自然我们把它们赶到了装备上面。那只斑点狗也跟着——这可落不下它；第一天它就在打架的时候好几次把这只或者那只狗撞到水里去。船上狭窄拥挤，它不喜欢挤在一起。</td>
		<td class="en">When the ice cleared out of the lakes and river, we put our outfit in a Lake Bennett boat and started for Dawson.We had a good team of dogs, and of course we piled them on top the outfit.That Spot was along—there was no losing him; and a dozen times, the first day, he knocked one or another of the dogs overboard in the course of fighting with them.It was close quarters, and he didn’t like being crowded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那只狗需要的是空间，”史蒂夫第二天说道，“我们把它放到荒岛上去吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What that dog needs is space,” Steve said the second day.“Let’s maroon him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们确实这么做了，把船停在卡布里渡口，让它跳上岸去。另外两只不错的狗也跟着它上了岸；我们花了整整两天找它们。我们再没见过那两只狗，但得到的安静和宽慰还是让我们觉得物有所值，就像那个拒绝拿回150美金的人一样。几个月以来，我和史蒂夫第一次吹着口哨，连笑带唱的。我们真是高兴极了。黑暗的日子过去了。噩梦被驱散了。那只斑点狗消失了。</td>
		<td class="en">We did, running the boat in at Caribou Crossing for him to jump ashore.Two of the other dogs, good dogs, followed him; and we lost two whole days trying to find them.We never saw those two dogs again; but the quietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide, like the man who refused his hundred and fifty, that it was cheap at the price.For the first time in months Steve and I laughed and whistled and sang.We were as happy as clams.The dark days were over.The nightmare had been lifted.That Spot was gone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >三个星期后的一个早晨，我和史蒂夫站在道森的河岸上。一条从本尼特湖区驶来的小船刚刚到岸。我看见史蒂夫愣了一下，听到他咒骂了一句，而且声音还不小。接着我也看到了，就在那条船的船头上，那只斑点狗竖着耳朵，坐在那儿。我和史蒂夫马上鬼鬼祟祟地溜了，就像被打败了的坏蛋、懦夫或是畏罪潜逃的犯人一样。一位中尉警官看见了我们鬼鬼祟祟的样子，恰恰把我们当成了逃犯。他以为船上有追捕我们的法官。他不等查清真相，就监视起我们，最后在M.& M．酒吧的一角找到了我们。我们花了好半天时间解释我们不想到船上见到那只斑点狗，最后他让另一个警察盯着我们，自己去了那条船。摆脱他之后，我们便回小屋了。当我们到达的时候，那只斑点狗正坐在门廊上等着我们呢。那么它是怎么知道我们住在那儿的呢？那个夏天道森有四万多人，它怎么能从所有的小屋中找出我们的呢？不管怎么说，它怎么知道我们在道森呢？我把这个问题交给你了。但是别忘了我说的它的智慧以及那种我曾在它眼睛里见到过的闪耀着永恒的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">Three weeks later, one morning, Steve and I were standing on the river-bank at Dawson.A small boat was just arriving from Lake Bennett.I saw Steve give a start, and heard him say something that was not nice and that was not under his breath.Then I looked; and there, in the bow of the boat, with ears pricked up, sat Spot.Steve and I sneaked immediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like absconders from justice.It was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he saw us sneaking.He surmised that there were law-officers in the boat who were after us.He didn’t wait to find out, but kept us in sight, and in the M. & M. saloon got us in a corner.We had a merry time explaining, for we refused to go back to the boat and meet Spot; and finally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the boat.After we got clear of him, we started for the cabin, and when we arrived, there was that Spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us.Now how did he know we lived there?There were forty thousand people in Dawson that summer, and how did he savve our cabin out of all the cabins?How did he know we were in Dawson, anyway?I leave it to you.But don’t forget what I said about his intelligence and that immortal something I have seen glimmering in his eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >再也摆脱不掉它了。道森有很多人曾在奇尔库特买下过它，这个故事便流传开来了。有好几次我们把它放到开往育空的汽船上；但它只是第一次登陆的时候肯上岸，并且很快又跑回河岸边了。我们没法卖掉它，我们也不能杀掉它（我和史蒂夫都已经试过了），其他人也杀不了它。它的生命似乎被魔法保护着。我曾看见它在街上冲入一场和五十只狗的混战中。当这些狗被分开时，它全身而退，毫发未损，而另外两只和它打架的狗却躺在地上死了。</td>
		<td class="en">There was no getting rid of him any more.There were too many people in Dawson who had bought him up on Chilcoot, and the story got around.Half a dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down the Yukon; but he merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted back up the bank.We couldn’t sell him, we couldn’t kill him (both Steve and I had tried), and nobody else was able to kill him.He bore a charmed life.I’ve seen him go down in a dogfight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of him, and when they were separated, he’d appear on all his four legs, unharmed, while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would be lying dead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我见过它从丁威迪少校的地窖中偷了一大块驼鹿肉，肉很沉，它距手里拿着一把斧子追它的丁威迪夫人的印第安厨娘仅一步之遥。它跑上了山，印第安女人便放弃了，之后丁威迪少校亲自出来，用他那把温彻斯特式狩猎枪向山上连续射击。他把弹夹打空了两次，却仍然没有击中斑点狗。然后一个警察过来逮捕了他，因为他在城市禁区内开枪射击。丁威迪少校交了罚款，我和史蒂夫则按一美元一英镑肉的价钱，赔偿他全部的驼鹿肉钱，包括骨头什么的都算上。那是他买鹿肉的价钱。那年的肉价很高。</td>
		<td class="en">I saw him steal a chunk of moose-meat from Major Dinwiddie’s cache so heavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of Mrs. Dinwiddie’s squaw cook, who was after him with an axe.As he went up the hill, after the squaw gave up, Major Dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his Winchester into the landscape.He emptied his magazine twice, and never touched that Spot.Then a policeman came along and arrested him for discharging firearms inside the city limits.Major Dinwiddie paid his fine, and Steve and I paid him for the moose-meat at the rate of a dollar a pound, bones and all.That was what he paid for it.Meat was high that year.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我只是在讲我亲眼看到过的事。我再讲一件我亲眼见到的事。我见过那只斑点狗掉进了一个水井里。冰层有三英尺半那么厚，水流把它像根稻草一样卷到了下面。冰层三百码之下，就是一口医院用的大井。斑点狗从医院那口井中爬出来，舔掉身上的水，咬出趾甲间的冰，一路小跑到岸上，还打败了戈尔德长官的一只大纽芬兰犬。</td>
		<td class="en">I am only telling what I saw with my own eyes.And now I’ll tell you something also.I saw that Spot fall through a water-hole.The ice was three and a half feet thick, and the current sucked him under like a straw.Three hundred yards below was the big water-hole used by the hospital.Spot crawled out of the hospital water-hole, licked off the water, bit out the ice that had formed between his toes, trotted up the bank, and whipped a big Newfoundland belonging to the Gold Commissioner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1898年的秋天，我和史蒂夫撑船划过育空河的最后一片水域，前往斯图尔特河。我们带上了所有雪橇狗，除了那只斑点狗。我们认为我们养它的时间够长了。它给我们带来的麻烦，耗费的时间、金钱和食物远大于我们在奇尔库特卖它所得——尤其在耗费的食物方面。所以我和史蒂夫把它拴在了小木屋里就离开了。那晚我们在印第安河口处扎营，我和史蒂夫在摆脱它这件事上开起了玩笑。史蒂夫是个有趣的家伙，当我坐在毯子里笑个不停的时候，一阵龙卷风袭击了营地。斑点狗走进狗群中惩罚它们的方式真是令人毛骨悚然。那它是怎样逃脱的呢？这就交给你们了。我实在是想不出。它又是怎样渡过克朗代克河的呢？这是另一个难题。不管怎样，它怎么知道我们已经去了育空呢？你看，我们走的是水路，它不可能嗅出我们的踪迹。史蒂夫和我开始对那只狗有些迷信了。它也让我们感到很烦；还有，这事就你我知道，我们实在是有点儿怕它。</td>
		<td class="en">In the fall of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the last water, bound for Stewart River.We took the dogs along, all except Spot.We figured we’d been feeding him long enough.He’d cost us more time and trouble and money and grub than we’d got by selling him on the Chilcoot—especially grub.So Steve and I tied him down in the cabin and pulled our freight.We camped that night at the mouth of Indian River, and Steve and I were pretty facetious over having shaken him.Steve was a funny cuss, and I was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing when a tornado hit camp.The way that Spot walked into those dogs and gave them what-for was hair-raising.Now how did he get loose?It’s up to you.I haven’t any theory.And how did he get across the Klondike River?That’s another facer.And anyway, how did he know we had gone up the Yukon?You see, we went by water, and he couldn’t smell our tracks.Steve and I began to get superstitious about that dog.He got on our nerves, too; and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我们到亨德森湾的河口处时，封冻期到来了。我们用这只狗和一队前往怀特河的人换了两袋面粉。如今那整个队伍都失踪了。不论是人、狗、雪橇还是其他东西的任何踪迹或皮毛都无影无踪。他们在视线中彻底消失了。这成了国内的谜团之一。我和史蒂夫坚持不懈地朝着斯图尔特进发，六个星期后，那只斑点狗爬进了帐篷。它成了一具游荡着的骷髅，而且只能拖着脚走，但是它却到那儿了。我想知道的是，谁告诉它我们北上去了斯图尔特呢？我们可能去一千个别的地方啊。它是怎样知道的呢？你先告诉我，我才能告诉你。</td>
		<td class="en">The freeze-up came on when we were at the mouth of Henderson Creek, and we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up White River after copper.Now that whole outfit was lost.Never trace nor hide nor hair of men, dogs, sleds, or anything was ever found.They dropped clean out of sight.It became one of the mysteries of the country.Steve and I plugged away up the Stewart, and six weeks afterward that Spot crawled into camp.He was a perambulating skeleton, and could just drag along; but he got there.And what I want to know is, who told him we were up the Stewart?We could have gone to a thousand other places.How did he know?You tell me, and I’ll tell you.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >怎么也摆脱不掉它了。在梅奥，它同一只印第安狗打了一架。那只狗的年轻主人拿着一把斧子向斑点狗挥去，却没有击中它，而杀死了他自己的狗。说起魔力和避开子弹——举例来说吧，我觉得躲避一个高大的年轻人的斧子要更为难得一见。但是我亲眼见它做到了。那个年轻人并不想杀自己的狗。你给我解释下吧。</td>
		<td class="en">No losing him.At the Mayo he started a row with an Indian dog.The buck who owned the dog took a swing at Spot with an axe, missed him, and killed his own dog.Talk about magic and turning bullets aside—I, for one, consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big buck at the other end of it.And I saw him do it with my own eyes.That buck didn’t want to kill his own dog.You’ve got to show me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我告诉过你斑点狗闯入过我们贮藏肉的地窖。那次差点儿把我们饿死。没有什么能够杀了吃的动物了，而我们只有靠肉才能生存下去。驼鹿已经退回到几百英里开外的地方了，印第安人也在那里。这就是我们的处境。春天来了，我们只能等着河面解冻。当决定以狗为食的时候，我们已经骨瘦如柴了，我们打算先从斑点狗下手。你知道那只狗做了什么吗？它偷偷地溜了。那它又怎么知道我们下定决心要吃了它呢？我们熬夜埋伏等着它，但它却一直没回来，我们只好吃掉其它的狗。我们把整队的狗都吃了。</td>
		<td class="en">I told you about Spot breaking into our meat cache.It was nearly the death of us.There wasn’t any more meat to be killed, and meat was all we had to live on.The moose had gone back several hundred miles and the Indians with them.There we were.Spring was on, and we had to wait for the river to break.We got pretty thin before we decided to eat the dogs, and we decided to eat Spot first.Do you know what that dog did?He sneaked.Now how did he know our minds were made up to eat him?We sat up nights laying for him, but he never came back, and we ate the other dogs.We ate the whole team.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还有个后续。你知道，一条大河解冻时，几十亿吨冰块流动的场景，那些冰块搅在一起，彼此挤压、碾磨着。就在最激烈的时刻，就在斯图尔特河水流湍急、奔腾咆哮着的时候，我们看见斑点狗在河的中央。它试图越过某个地方的时候，陷在了河里。我和史蒂夫又喊又叫，在岸边跑来跑去，帽子也扔上了天。我们不时地停下来互相拥抱，我们是如此地高兴，因为终于看到斑点狗完蛋了。它连百万分之一的机会都没有。它根本没有任何机会。解冻期之后，我们跳进一艘独木舟，向下游的育空划去，然后又去了道森，并在亨德森湾河口处的小木屋里呆了一周补充体力。当我们在道森上岸的时候，斑点狗已经坐在那里等候我们了。它竖起耳朵，摇着尾巴，嘴角微笑着，向我们致以热烈的欢迎。那它又是怎样从冰块中逃脱的呢？它怎么知道我们此时此刻正前往道森，还那么准时，跑到岸边等我们呢？</td>
		<td class="en">And now for the sequel.You know what it is when a big river breaks up and a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and milling and grinding.Just in the thick of it, when the Stewart went out, rumbling and roaring, we sighted Spot out in the middle.He’d got caught as he was trying to cross up above somewhere.Steve and I yelled and shouted and ran up and down the bank, tossing our hats in the air.Sometimes we’d stop and hug each other, we were that boisterous, for we saw Spot’s finish.He didn’t have a chance in a million.He didn’t have any chance at all.After the ice-run, we got into a canoe and paddled down to the Yukon, and down the Yukon to Dawson, stopping to feed up for a week at the cabins at the mouth of Henderson Creek.And as we came in to the bank at Dawson, there sat that Spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked up, his tail wagging, his mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to us.Now how did he get out of that ice?How did he know we were coming to Dawson, to the very hour and minute, to be out there on the bank waiting for us?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >关于那只斑点狗，我想的越多，我就越相信这世界上有很多事情是科学所无法解释的。任何科学依据都无法解释那只斑点狗。我猜想这是超自然现象或者神秘主义，或者那之类的什么东西，加上一大堆通神学的理论。克朗代克是个好地方。要不是斑点狗，我应该已经在那儿成了一名百万富翁了。它让我心烦意乱。我整整忍受了它两年，而且我觉得我筋疲力尽了。我离开的时候，正是1899年的夏天。我什么也没对史蒂夫说。我只是悄悄地走了。但我都安排好了。我给史蒂夫写了张便条，并附上了一包“灭鼠药”，告诉他如何使用。我被那只斑点狗折磨得筋疲力尽、骨瘦如柴。我总是紧张兮兮的，以至于附近没人的时候我都要跳起来，向四处张望一下。但是摆脱了它之后，我以惊人的速度恢复着体力。到达旧金山之前，我已经增了20磅；乘渡船到奥克兰的时候，我就恢复如初了，所以即使我妻子也没看出来我有什么变化。</td>
		<td class="en">The more I think of that Spot, the more I am convinced that there are things in this world that go beyond science.On no scientific grounds can that Spot be explained.It’s psychic phenomena, or mysticism, or something of that sort, I guess, with a lot of Theosophy thrown in.The Klondike is a good country.I might have been there yet, and become a millionaire, if it hadn’t been for Spot.He got on my nerves.I stood him for two years altogether, and then I guess my stamina broke.It was the summer of 1899 when I pulled out.I didn’t say anything to Steve.I just sneaked.But I fixed it up all right.I wrote Steve a note, and enclosed a package of “rough-on-rats,” telling him what to do with it.I was worn down to skin and bone by that Spot, and I was that nervous that I’d jump and look around when there wasn’t anybody within hailing distance.But it was astonishing the way I recuperated when I got quit of him.I got back twenty pounds before I arrived in San Francisco, and by the time I’d crossed the ferry to Oakland I was my old self again, so that even my wife looked in vain for any change in me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >史蒂夫曾给我写过一封信，信中显得很是恼火。他过得不太顺心，因为我把那只斑点狗留给了他。他还说他用了“灭鼠药”，到处都用上了，可是什么效果也没有。一年过去了。我回到了办公室工作，各方面都很有起色——甚至还有点儿发福。接着史蒂夫来了。他并没有来看望我。我在汽船乘客名单上看到了他的名字，很好奇他为什么没来看我。但是我并没有好奇多久。一天早晨起床后，我发现斑点狗被拴在了门柱上，拦住了送奶工的路。就在那天早上，我得知史蒂夫北上去了西雅图。我再也没有胖起来过。妻子让我给它买个项圈和标牌，出于感激，不到一小时，它就把她的宠物波斯猫给弄死了。这下，我是怎样都摆脱不了那只斑点狗了。它会一直跟着我直到我死，因为它永远死不了。自从它来了之后，我的胃口也没那么好了，妻子说我看起来很消瘦。昨晚那只斑点狗跑进了哈维先生的鸡笼里（哈维是我们隔壁的邻居），咬死了十九只品种优良的小鸡。我不得不为它们付款。旁边的邻居们和妻子大吵了一架后，搬了出去。斑点狗是起因。这就是我为什么对斯蒂芬·麦凯非常失望的原因。我不知道他竟是如此卑劣的人。</td>
		<td class="en">Steve wrote to me once, and his letter seemed irritated.He took it kind of hard because I’d left him with Spot.Also, he said he’d used the “rough-on-rats,” per directions, and that there was nothing doing.A year went by.I was back in the office and prospering in all ways—even getting a bit fat.And then Steve arrived.He didn’t look me up.I read his name in the steamer list, and wondered why.But I didn’t wonder long.I got up one morning and found that Spot chained to the gate-post and holding up the milkman.Steve went north to Seattle, I learned, that very morning.I didn’t put on any more weight.My wife made me buy him a collar and tag, and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing her pet Persian cat.There is no getting rid of that Spot.He will be with me until I die, for he’ll never die.My appetite is not so good since he arrived, and my wife says I am looking peaked.Last night that Spot got into Mr. Harvey’s hen-house (Harvey is my next-door neighbour) and killed nineteen of his fancy-bred chickens.I shall have to pay for them.My neighbours on the other side quarrelled with my wife and then moved out.Spot was the cause of it.And that is why I am disappointed in Stephen Mackaye.I had no idea he was so mean a man.</td></tr>
