		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就因为我们得病了，他们就剥夺了我们的自由。我们遵守法律。我们没有做什么不义的事。但他们却要把我们投进监狱，莫洛凯岛是个监狱。大家都知道。那边那个人，纽利，他妹妹七年前就被发配到莫洛凯岛。从那以后，他就再也没见过她，他以后也见不到她了。她会一直被关在那里，直到她死去。这不是她的意愿，也不是纽利的意愿。这是统治这片土地的白人的意愿。那么这些白人是谁呢？</td>
		<td class="en">“Because we are sick they take away our liberty.We have obeyed the law.We have done no wrong.And yet they would put us in prison.Molokai is a prison.That you know.Niuli, there, his sister was sent to Molokai seven years ago.He has not seen her since.Nor will he ever see her.She must stay there until she dies.This is not her will.It is not Niuli’s will.It is the will of the white men who rule the land.And who are these white men?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们知道。这是从我们父辈那里传下来的。他们来的时候就像小羊羔一样，说话轻柔温和。他们说话就得温和点，因为那时我们人多势众，再加上所有的岛屿都是我们的。正如我所说的，他们说话很温和。他们中有两类人。一类征求我们的许可，我们仁慈的许可，来向我们宣传上帝之道。另一类也征求我们的许可，我们仁慈的许可，来跟我们做贸易。那只是个开始。如今所有的岛都是他们的了，所有的土地，所有的牲口——一切都归他们所有了。那些宣传上帝之道的人和那些卖朗姆酒的人碰到一起，变成了大首领。他们住着有很多个房间的房子，过着国王般的生活，还有一大堆仆人侍奉着。曾经的他们一无所有，现在却拥有了一切，如果你、我或者任何一个夏威夷土人挨饿，他们就会冷笑着说：“嗯，你为什么不干活呢？这里有的是种植园。’</td>
		<td class="en">“We know.We have it from our fathers and our fathers’ fathers.They came like lambs, speaking softly.Well might they speak softly, for we were many and strong, and all the islands were ours.As I say, they spoke softly.They were of two kinds.The one kind asked our permission, our gracious permission, to preach to us the word of God.The other kind asked our permission, our gracious permission, to trade with us.That was the beginning.Today all the islands are theirs, all the land, all the cattle—everything is theirs.They that preached the word of God and they that preached the word of Rum have fore-gathered and become great chiefs.They live like kings in houses of many rooms, with multitudes of servants to care for them.They who had nothing have everything, and if you, or I, or any Kanaka be hungry, they sneer and say, ‘Well, why don’t you work?There are the plantations.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >库鲁停顿了一下。他抬起手指粗糙扭曲的那只手，举起了戴在黑发上那色彩鲜艳的芙蓉花环。月光把一切镀成了银色。那是个平静的夜晚，但坐在他周围听他说话的人，看起来都像是经历过战争的磨难似的。他们的脸长得像狮子。脸上长鼻子的地方变成一个裂口，手已经烂掉了，只剩下一截胳膊。他们这三十个男男女女被人排挤在外，已经被印上了野兽的标记。</td>
		<td class="en">Koolau paused.He raised one hand, and with gnarled and twisted fingers lifted up the blazing wreath of hibiscus that crowned his black hair.The moonlight bathed the scene in silver.It was a night of peace, though those who sat about him and listened had all the seeming of battle-wrecks.Their faces were leonine.Here a space yawned in a face where should have been a nose, and there an arm-stump showed where a hand had rotted off.They were men and women beyond the pale, the thirty of them, for upon them had been placed the mark of the beast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这香气沁人、月色明亮的夜晚，他们头戴花环坐在那里，嘴里发出粗鲁的噪声，喉咙里发出刺耳的声音，来表示对库鲁的演讲的赞同。他们也曾经是男人和女人。但他们不再是男人和女人了。他们是怪物——无论是脸还是体形，对于人来说都是怪诞丑陋的。他们的身体残疾、扭曲得叫人害怕，看起来像是在千年炼狱中饱受折磨的怪物。他们还有手的时候，那手看起来就像鸟身女妖的爪子。某位疯狂的神明，玩弄着生命的机关，挤压擦伤他们的脸，把他们弄得丑陋吓人。到处都可以看到被疯狂的神明毁坏了一半的容貌，一个女人的热泪从一双恐怖的小坑里流了出来，那里曾经长着她的眼睛。有的人感到疼痛，胸口里发出呻吟声。有的人咳嗽着，那声音就像在撕扯布片。有两个人是白痴，像是生来就有缺陷的巨猿，哪怕猿是天使也是如此。他们在月光下扮着怪相、喋喋不休地说话，头上戴着发蔫的金黄色的花环。有一个人，他的耳垂肿得像把扇子，拍打着肩膀，他突然抓到一朵非常漂亮的花，是朵橘黄色和猩红色相间的花，用来装饰那随着他的每个动作来回摆动的大耳朵。</td>
		<td class="en">They sat, flower-garlanded, in the perfumed, luminous night, and their lips made uncouth noises and their throats rasped approval of Koolau’s speech.They were creatures who once had been men and women.But they were men and women no longer.They were monsters—in face and form grotesque caricatures of everything human.They were hideously maimed and distorted, and had the seeming of creatures that had been racked in millenniums of hell.Their hands, when they possessed them, were like harpy claws.Their faces were the misfits and slips, crushed and bruised by some mad god at play in the machinery of life.Here and there were features which the mad god had smeared half away, and one woman wept scalding tears from twin pits of horror, where her eyes once had been.Some were in pain and groaned from their chests.Others coughed, making sounds like the tearing of tissue.Two were idiots, more like huge apes marred in the making, until even an ape were an angel.They mowed and gibbered in the moonlight, under crowns of drooping, golden blossoms.One, whose bloated ear-lobe flapped like a fan upon his shoulder, caught up a gorgeous flower of orange and scarlet and with it decorated the monstrous ear that flip-flapped with his every movement.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >库鲁是这个天地的国王。这就是他的王国——一个鲜花丛生的峡谷，周围是悬垂的峭壁和悬崖，从那里传来野山羊咩咩的叫声。三面都直立着令人毛骨悚然的山壁，山壁上面覆盖着奇异的热带植被，还有通向巢穴的入口——那是库鲁臣民的岩石巢穴。第四面的地面陷入一个巨大的深渊，在深渊的下方，可以看见低矮的山峰和峭壁的顶峰，在它们的底部太平洋的波涛撞击起一阵阵泡沫，隆隆作响。天气好的时候，船可以在岩石海滩上着陆，那正是卡拉劳山谷的入口，不过只有在天气非常晴朗的时候才行。一位头脑冷静的登山者也许可以从海滩上爬到卡拉劳山谷的顶部，进入库鲁统治的这块山峰环绕的地区；然而这位登山者的头脑必须非常清醒，还得要非常了解野山羊小径。库鲁的人民，这群身躯残破不全的人们，竟然能够靠着这眼花缭乱的山羊脚印把自己从无助的苦难中解脱出来，来到这个难以到达的地方，真个奇迹。</td>
		<td class="en">And over these things Koolau was king.And this was his kingdom,—a flower-throttled gorge, with beetling cliffs and crags, from which floated the blattings of wild goats.On three sides the grim walls rose, festooned in fantastic draperies of tropic vegetation and pierced by cave-entrances—the rocky lairs of Koolau’s subjects.On the fourth side the earth fell away into a tremendous abyss, and, far below, could be seen the summits of lesser peaks and crags, at whose bases foamed and rumbled the Pacific surge.In fine weather a boat could land on the rocky beach that marked the entrance of Kalalau Valley, but the weather must be very fine.And a cool-headed mountaineer might climb from the beach to the head of Kalalau Valley, to this pocket among the peaks where Koolau ruled; but such a mountaineer must be very cool of head, and he must know the wild-goat trails as well.The marvel was that the mass of human wreckage that constituted Koolau’s people should have been able to drag its helpless misery over the giddy goat-trails to this inaccessible spot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“兄弟们。”库鲁开始说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Brothers,” Koolau began.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那些人面貌丑陋、相貌扭曲、长得像人猿，其中一个疯狂地尖叫了一声，库鲁等待着，尖锐的狂笑声在石壁间回荡，回声穿过这了无生机的夜色传到远处。</td>
		<td class="en">But one of the mowing, apelike travesties emitted a wild shriek of madness, and Koolau waited while the shrill cachination was tossed back and forth among the rocky walls and echoed distantly through the pulseless night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“兄弟们，这不奇怪吗？我们的一切就是这土地，看呀，但这片土地却不是我们的。为了换取这片土地，那些传教的人和做朗姆酒生意的人又给了我们什么？你们中的哪一个人靠这土地拿到过一美元那么多钱的？现在土地是他们的，他们反过来告诉我们，我们可以在这片土地上工作，在他们的土地上，我们辛辛苦苦的劳动成果也成了他们的。然而以前我们无需干活。而且现在，如果我们生病了，他们就剥夺了我们的自由。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Brothers, is it not strange?Ours was the land, and behold, the land is not ours.What did these preachers of the word of God and the word of Rum give us for the land?Have you received one dollar, as much as one dollar, any one of you, for the land?Yet it is theirs, and in return they tell us we can go to work on the land, their land, and that what we produce by our toil shall be theirs.Yet in the old days we did not have to work.Also, when we are sick, they take away our freedom.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是谁带来了这疾病，库鲁？”凯罗利阿纳问道，他瘦长而结实，一张脸酷似笑呵呵的农牧神，人们都觉得他下面应该长着分趾蹄。他的脚是裂开的，这倒是真的，不过，裂开的地方却是严重的溃疡和青灰色的脓包。这就是凯罗利阿纳，他们所有人当中最勇敢的登山者，他了解每一条山羊小径，并带着库鲁和他不幸的追随者们走进卡拉劳的隐蔽处。</td>
		<td class="en">“Who brought the sickness, Koolau?” demanded Kiloliana, a lean and wiry man with a face so like a laughing faun’s that one might expect to see the cloven hoofs under him.They were cloven, it was true, but the cleavages were great ulcers and livid putrefactions.Yet this was Kiloliana, the most daring climber of them all, the man who knew every goat-trail and who had led Koolau and his wretched followers into the recesses of Kalalau.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好，问得好。”库鲁回答，“由于我们不愿在数英里的甘蔗地里工作，那里曾经是我们养马的地方，所以他们从海外带来了中国奴隶。随之而来的还有中国的疾病——就是我们得的这种病，而且就因为这病，他们要把我们监禁在莫洛凯岛。我们在考爱岛出生。我们曾去过其他的岛屿，有这边的也有那边的，瓦胡岛、毛依岛、夏威夷岛、火奴鲁鲁岛。但是我们总会回到考爱岛的。我们为什么要回来呢？肯定是有原因的。因为我们爱考爱岛。我们在这里出生。我们在这里生活。而且我们也会死在这里——除非——除非——我们之中有人缺乏勇气。但这些人不是我们想要的。他们适合去莫洛凯岛。如果有这样的人，让他们离开。明天士兵们就上岸了。让缺乏勇气的人下去找他们吧。他们很快就会被发配到莫洛凯岛。至于我们，会留下来战斗。但是，要知道，我们不会死的。我们有步枪。你们知道那些狭窄的小径，人们只能一个接一个地匍匐爬行通过。我，库鲁，曾经是尼华岛上的一个牛仔，一个人就能把千人抵挡在小径之外。这位是卡佩雷，他以前是个法官，是个品德高尚的人，但他现在却像你我一样，成了被追捕的过街老鼠。听听他的看法。他很聪明。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ay, well questioned,” Koolau answered.“Because we would not work the miles of sugar-cane where once our horses pastured, they brought the Chinese slaves from overseas.And with them came the Chinese sickness—that which we suffer from and because of which they would imprison us on Molokai.We were born on Kauai.We have been to the other islands, some here and some there, to Oahu, to Maui, to Hawaii, to Honolulu.Yet always did we come back to Kauai.Why did we come back?There must be a reason.Because we love Kauai.We were born here.Here we have lived.And here shall we die—unless—unless—there be weak hearts amongst us.Such we do not want.They are fit for Molokai.And if there be such, let them not remain.Tomorrow the soldiers land on the shore.Let the weak hearts go down to them.They will be sent swiftly to Molokai.As for us, we shall stay and fight.But know that we will not die.We have rifles.You know the narrow trails where men must creep, one by one.I, alone, Koolau, who was once a cowboy on Niihau, can hold the trail against a thousand men.Here is Kapalei, who was once a judge over men and a man with honour, but who is now a hunted rat, like you and me.Hear him.He is wise.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡佩雷站起身。他曾经是个法官。他在普纳荷读的大学。他以前同贵族、首领，还有那些保护贸易者和传教士利益的外国势力的高级代表一起吃过饭。这就是以前的卡佩雷。但现在，正如库鲁所说的，他是一只被追捕的老鼠，一个逍遥法外的家伙，深陷于人类恐怖的泥潭之中，他在法律之上，也在法律之下。他脸上没有五官，只剩下开着的口子和光秃秃的眉毛底下那双烧没了眼皮的眼睛。</td>
		<td class="en">Kapalei arose.Once he had been a judge.He had gone to college at Punahou.He had sat at meat with lords and chiefs and the high representatives of alien powers who protected the interests of traders and missionaries.Such had been Kapalei.But now, as Koolau had said, he was a hunted rat, a creature outside the law, sunk so deep in the mire of human horror that he was above the law as well as beneath it.His face was featureless, save for gaping orifices and for the lidless eyes that burned under hairless brows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们不要找麻烦。”他开始说道，“我们要求不受干涉。但是如果他们非要干涉我们，那么就是他们在找麻烦，找罪受。大家都看到了，我没有手指。”他举起双手的残肢，让所有人都看得见。“不过我还有一根大拇指的关节，我能用它拉动扳机，就跟以前用其他手指一样坚稳。我们热爱考爱岛。让我们生在这里，或者死在这里，但是不要让我们去莫洛凯岛的监牢。疾病不属于我们。我们没有罪过。传教的人和做朗姆酒生意的人带来了那些苦力，那些人在偷来的土地上干活，同时也带来了疾病。我一直是个法官。我了解法律和司法制度，我要对你们说，窃取别人的土地，把中国的病毒传染给他，然后还要把这个人投入牢狱、监禁终身，这是不公正的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Let us not make trouble,” he began.“We ask to be left alone.But if they do not leave us alone, then is the trouble theirs and the penalty.My fingers are gone, as you see.”He held up his stumps of hands that all might see.“Yet have I the joint of one thumb left, and it can pull a trigger as firmly as did its lost neighbour in the old days.We love Kauai.Let us live here, or die here, but do not let us go to the prison of Molokai.The sickness is not ours.We have not sinned.The men who preached the word of God and the word of Rum brought the sickness with the coolie slaves who work the stolen land.I have been a judge.I know the law and the justice, and I say to you it is unjust to steal a man’s land, to make that man sick with the Chinese sickness, and then to put that man in prison for life.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“人生很短暂，而就连这些日子也都是充满痛苦，”库鲁说，“让我们喝酒舞蹈，尽情欢乐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Life is short, and the days are filled with pain,” said Koolau.“Let us drink and dance and be happy as we can.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个石穴里长了很多葫芦，人们把这些葫芦传递开来。葫芦里装满了用铁树根部蒸馏出的烈性液体，液体在他们身体里火热地流淌着，上升到脑子里，他们忘记了自己曾经是男人和女人，因为他们再一次成为男人和女人了。女人空空的眼眶里流出热泪，她拨动着四弦琴的琴弦，唱起爱之歌，声音响亮而粗犷，犹如从森林深处的原始世界传来，在这个时候她确实是个充满活力的女人。她轻柔、傲慢，又诱人的声音调动起了气氛。凯罗利阿纳站在垫子上，伴着这个女人唱歌的节奏，跳起舞来。舞步准确无误。他的每个动作都流露着爱，然后接着，一个女人跟他一起在垫子上起舞，这个女人丰满的臀部和饱满的乳房掩盖了她那受疾病侵蚀的脸孔。这是一次活死人的舞会，虽然他们身躯残缺不全，却依然对生命怀有爱和渴望。那个失明的女人，一直流着热泪歌唱着爱；爱的舞者在这温暖的夜里一直跳舞；这葫芦也四处传递，直到他们的脑袋里都爬满记忆和欲望的怪念头。在垫子上，同那个女人一起跳舞的还有个苗条的少女，她脸庞美丽、完好无损，但她上下摆动、扭曲的胳膊却是这疾病的摧残所致。那两个白痴，嘴里叽里咕噜地发出奇怪的声音，他们分开跳舞，滑稽地模仿着，怪诞而奇妙，正如他们自己被生活扭曲着。</td>
		<td class="en">From one of the rocky lairs calabashes were produced and passed round.The calabashes were filled with the fierce distillation of the root of the ti-plant; and as the liquid fire coursed through them and mounted to their brains, they forgot that they had once been men and women, for they were men and women once more.The woman who wept scalding tears from open eye-pits was indeed a woman apulse with life as she plucked the strings of an ukulele and lifted her voice in a barbaric love-call such as might have come from the dark forest-depths of the primeval world.The air tingled with her cry, softly imperious and seductive.Upon a mat, timing his rhythm to the woman’s song Kiloliana danced.It was unmistakable.Love danced in all his movements, and, next, dancing with him on the mat, was a woman whose heavy hips and generous breast gave the lie to her disease-corroded face.It was a dance of the living dead, for in their disintegrating bodies life still loved and longed.Ever the woman whose sightless eyes ran scalding tears chanted her love-cry, ever the dancers of love danced in the warm night, and ever the calabashes went around till in all their brains were maggots crawling of memory and desire.And with the woman on the mat danced a slender maid whose face was beautiful and unmarred, but whose twisted arms that rose and fell marked the disease’s ravage.And the two idiots, gibbering and mouthing strange noises, danced apart, grotesque, fantastic, travestying love as they themselves had been travestied by life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是这个女人的爱之歌唱到一半被打断了，葫芦低了下去，跳舞的人们也停了下来，所有人都凝视着海面上方黑漆漆的一片，在那里一颗火箭弹闪了一下，就像是苍白的幽灵穿过月夜。</td>
		<td class="en">But the woman’s love-cry broke midway, the calabashes were lowered, and the dancers ceased, as all gazed into the abyss above the sea, where a rocket flared like a wan phantom through the moonlit air.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是士兵们放的。”库鲁说，“明天就要战斗了。最好去睡觉，做好准备。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is the soldiers,” said Koolau.“Tomorrow there will be fighting.It is well to sleep and be prepared.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麻风病人们听从命令，都爬到悬崖上他们的穴窝里，只剩下库鲁一个人，在这月色里一动不动地坐着，他把步枪横在两膝之间，往下凝视着远处登陆海滩的船只。</td>
		<td class="en">The lepers obeyed, crawling away to their lairs in the cliff, until only Koolau remained, sitting motionless in the moonlight, his rifle across his knees, as he gazed far down to the boats landing on the beach.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >选择遥远的库拉鲁山谷谷顶作为避难所，是经过仔细斟酌的。只有凯罗利阿纳熟悉陡峭山壁后面的小路，除了他，任何人要想成功到达这个峡谷，就必须通过如刀刃般狭窄的山脊。这个通道有一百码长，至多十二英寸宽。两边都是深渊。一个人向左或者向右一滑都会摔死。但是一旦通过了，他就会发现自己到了人间天堂。这片风景沐浴在植被的海洋中，碧波从一块块崖壁上倾泻而下，大量的藤蔓从山崖尖上垂下，一簇簇蕨类植物和附生植物伸进群集的岩石裂缝处。在库鲁数月的统治中，他和他的追随者们曾与这片植物海洋搏斗。野生的香蕉、橘子和芒果击退了令人窒息的丛林和蔓延滋长的花朵。一块块小空地上种着野竹芋；填满碎泥土的石阶，成了芋头田地和瓜田；有阳光照射的每处空地上，都长着挂满金色果实的番木瓜树。</td>
		<td class="en">The far head of Kalalau Valley had been well chosen as a refuge.Except Kiloliana, who knew back-trails up the precipitous walls, no man could win to the gorge save by advancing across a knife-edged ridge.This passage was a hundred yards in length.At best, it was a scant twelve inches wide.On either side yawned the abyss.A slip, and to right or left the man would fall to his death.But once across he would find himself in an earthly paradise.A sea of vegetation laved the landscape, pouring its green billows from wall to wall, dripping from the cliff-lips in great vine-masses, and flinging a spray of ferns and air-plants in to the multitudinous crevices.During the many months of Koolau’s rule, he and his followers had fought with this vegetable sea.The choking jungle, with its riot of blossoms, had been driven back from the bananas, oranges, and mangoes that grew wild.In little clearings grew the wild arrowroot; on stone terraces, filled with soil scrapings, were the taro patches and the melons; and in every open space where the sunshine penetrated were papaya trees burdened with their golden fruit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >库鲁被驱赶出海滩边的低谷，来到这个避难所。要是他又被驱赶出这个避难所，他也知道几个峡谷，位于隐蔽要塞所处的峰峦间，他可以带着他的百姓到那里避难生活。现在，他躺了下来，把步枪放在身边，透过凌乱的枝叶屏障，凝视着海滩上的士兵。他注意到他们带着大炮，大炮在阳光下像镜子一样反光。他正对着那如刀刃般狭窄的通道。他沿着通往通道的小路往上爬，还能看见变成小点的人。他知道他们不是士兵，而是警察。要是警察失败了，士兵就会参与进来。</td>
		<td class="en">Koolau had been driven to this refuge from the lower valley by the beach.And if he were driven from it in turn, he knew of gorges among the jumbled peaks of the inner fastnesses where he could lead his subjects and live.And now he lay with his rifle beside him, peering down through a tangled screen of foliage at the soldiers on the beach.He noted that they had large guns with them, from which the sunshine flashed as from mirrors.The knife-edged passage lay directly before him.Crawling upward along the trail that led to it he could see tiny specks of men.He knew they were not the soldiers, but the police.When they failed, then the soldiers would enter the game.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他深情地用一只扭曲的手擦拭着他的步枪枪筒，并确保视野清晰。在尼华岛上猎捕野牛的时候，他曾经学过射击，岛上的人都记得他是个神枪手。随着艰难前进的人影越来越近、越来越大，他估测了射程，估计了跟发射线成直角的风向造成的偏斜，并计算脱靶的可能性，因为那些目标远远低于他的水平线。但是他没有开枪。直到他们走到通道口上，他才会让他们知道他的存在。他没有暴露自己，只是在灌木丛里说话。</td>
		<td class="en">He affectionately rubbed a twisted hand along his rifle barrel and made sure that the sights were clean.He had learned to shoot as a wild-cattle hunter on Niihau, and on that island his skill as a marksman was unforgotten.As the toiling specks of men grew nearer and larger, he estimated the range, judged the deflection of the wind that swept at right angles across the line of fire, and calculated the chances of overshooting marks that were so far below his level.But he did not shoot.Not until they reached the beginning of the passage did he make his presence known.He did not disclose himself, but spoke from the thicket.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >库鲁回过头，眼看着他其余的同伙们走了过去。一群可怕的家伙排成一队，哼着声，叹着气，拖拽着可怜的身躯走了过去。这让库鲁感到更加痛苦，因为当他们从他身边经过时，他们大声诅咒、辱骂他，走在队尾那个气喘吁吁的丑婆停下来，伸出鸟身女妖般皮包骨的爪子，左右摇晃着她的那死人头，咆哮着诅咒他。他们一个接着一个从崖边跳了下去，向躲藏的士兵投降。</td>
		<td class="en">Koolau turned and watched the remnant of his band approach.Groaning and sighing, a ghastly procession, it dragged its wretchedness past.It was given to Koolau to taste a deeper bitterness, for they hurled imprecations and insults at him as they went by; and the panting hag who brought up the rear halted, and with skinny, harpy-claws extended, shaking her snarling death’s head from side to side, she laid a curse upon him.One by one they dropped over the lip-edge and surrendered to the hiding soldiers.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上尉从峭壁上滑了过去，滑向他的士兵。接下来，他没有举起休战的旗子，而是把帽子放在枪套上，库鲁开了一枪，一个子弹从帽子上穿了过去。那个下午，他们从海滩向他开炮，他后退到远处高不可及的小块地方后，士兵也跟着他。</td>
		<td class="en">The captain slipped over the cliff to his soldiers.The next moment, and without a flag of truce, he hoisted his hat on his scabbard, and Koolau’s bullet tore through it.That afternoon they shelled him out from the beach, and as he retreated into the high inaccessible pockets beyond, the soldiers followed him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >六个礼拜以来，他们在一个又一个地方追捕他，翻过了火山山顶，走过了山羊小径。当他躲在马缨丹丛中的时候，他们组成了几路狙击手，在马缨丹丛和番石榴丛中追捕他，就像是在追捕一只兔子。但他总是可以转身，加快脚步逃走。他总能绝处逢生。要是他被逼得太紧，他的步枪就肯定能阻挡他们，让他们抬着伤员沿着山羊小径下去，回到海滩上。有几次，他们开枪了，因为灌木丛里闪出了他棕色的身影。有一次，其中的五个人在两块地方之间一段无遮蔽的山羊小径上发现了他。他一瘸一拐地在那惊险的小路上爬，他们一直冲他开枪，直到打光了所有的子弹。后来，他们发现了血迹，知道他受伤了。过了六个礼拜，他们放弃了。士兵和警察返回了火奴鲁鲁，把卡拉鲁山谷留给了他，尽管偶尔还有人冒险来取他的人头，但都是自寻死路。</td>
		<td class="en">For six weeks they hunted him from pocket to pocket, over the volcanic peaks and along the goat-trails.When he hid in the lantana jungle, they formed lines of beaters, and through lantana jungle and guava scrub they drove him like a rabbit.But ever he turned and doubled and eluded.There was no cornering him.When pressed too closely, his sure rifle held them back and they carried their wounded down the goat-trails to the beach.There were times when they did the shooting as his brown body showed for a moment through the underbrush.Once, five of them caught him on an exposed goat-trail between pockets.They emptied their rifles at him as he limped and climbed along his dizzy way.Afterwards they found bloodstains and knew that he was wounded.At the end of six weeks they gave up.The soldiers and police returned to Honolulu, and Kalalau Valley was left to him for his own, though head-hunters ventured after him from time to time and to their own undoing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两年后，库鲁最后一次爬进一个灌木丛里，躺在红铁树叶和野生生姜花丛中。他曾经活得无拘无束，也会死得自由自在。天下起了小雨，他拽过来一张破烂的毯子，盖在自己扭曲变形的残肢上。他身上盖着一件油布外套。他把毛瑟枪横放在胸前，沉思了一会儿，满腹深情地擦拭着枪管上的潮气。他那擦枪的手上，已经没有手指可以用来拉动扳机了。</td>
		<td class="en">Two years later, and for the last time, Koolau crawled into a thicket and lay down among the ti-leaves and wild ginger blossoms.Free he had lived, and free he was dying.A slight drizzle of rain began to fall, and he drew a ragged blanket about the distorted wreck of his limbs.His body was covered with an oilskin coat.Across his chest he laid his Mauser rifle, lingering affectionately for a moment to wipe the dampness from the barrel.The hand with which he wiped had no fingers left upon it with which to pull the trigger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他闭上了眼睛，感觉到身体虚弱，思想模糊混乱，他知道他的生命快要结束了。他爬到一个隐蔽的地方等死，像只野兽一样。他迷迷糊糊、漫无目的、精神恍惚，仿佛回到了他早年在尼华岛的日子。随着他生命的消逝，雨滴的声音在他的耳朵里变得模糊起来，他似乎再一次起劲地驯马，马镫绑在下面，未经调教的小公马要么在他身下翻腾雀跃，要么疯狂地在驯马畜栏里冲来冲去，把来帮忙的牛仔都赶到围栏的另一边去。下一刻，他似乎很自然地发现自己追逐着高地草原上的野牛，用绳索套住它们，然后把它们拉到山谷里去。围栏上的汗水和尘土再一次刺痛了他的双眼和鼻孔。</td>
		<td class="en">He closed his eyes, for, from the weakness in his body and the fuzzy turmoil in his brain, he knew that his end was near.Like a wild animal he had crept into hiding to die.Half-conscious, aimless and wandering, he lived back in his life to his early manhood on Niihau.As life faded and the drip of the rain grew dim in his ears it seemed to him that he was once more in the thick of the horse-breaking, with raw colts rearing and bucking under him, his stirrups tied together beneath, or charging madly about the breaking corral and driving the helping cowboys over the rails.The next instant, and with seeming naturalness, he found himself pursuing the wild bulls of the upland pastures, roping them and leading them down to the valleys.Again the sweat and dust of the branding pen stung his eyes and bit his nostrils.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他回到了精力充沛、身体完好的青春时代，直到即将来临的死亡带来的痛苦把他带回了现实。他举起自己可怕的双手，惊奇地盯着它们。但是如何变成这样的呢？为什么？为什么那个健全、狂野的青年竟变成了这样？然后有那么一会，他又一次想起来，他是麻风病人库鲁。他的眼皮疲倦地闭上，他的耳朵也听不到雨水滴落的声音了。他的身体颤抖了好长时间。然后这种颤抖也停止了。他稍微抬了一下头，又落下去了。接着他睁开眼睛，再也没有闭上。他最后想到的是他的毛瑟枪，他交叠着自己没了手指的双手，把枪贴近了自己的胸口。</td>
		<td class="en">All his lusty, whole-bodied youth was his, until the sharp pangs of impending dissolution brought him back.He lifted his monstrous hands and gazed at them in wonder.But how?Why?Why should the wholeness of that wild youth of his change to this?Then he remembered, and once again, and for a moment, he was Koolau, the leper.His eyelids fluttered wearily down and the drip of the rain ceased in his ears.A prolonged trembling set up in his body.This, too, ceased.He half-lifted his head, but it fell back.Then his eyes opened, and did not close.His last thought was of his Mauser, and he pressed it against his chest with his folded, fingerless hands.</td></tr>
