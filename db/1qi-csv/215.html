		<td class="en">Chapter Three Jackson’s Arm</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我当时根本就没想到，杰克逊的胳膊竟然会在我的一生当中起了决定性的作用。当我找到杰克逊的时候，他本人并没有给我留下什么印象。我在沼泽边缘的港湾附近一所破烂不堪的房子里找到了他。那屋子周围是一些死水塘，水面上盖着一层看起来腐烂了的绿色浮垢，散发出一阵阵令人难以忍受的恶臭。</td>
		<td class="en">Little did I dream the fateful part Jackson’s arm was to play in my life.Jackson himself did not impress me when I hunted him out.I found him in a crazy, ramshackle(1) house down near the bay on the edge of the marsh.Pools of stagnant water stood around the house, their surfaces covered with a green and putrid-looking scum, while the stench that arose from them was intolerable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们还必须向房东付房租。考虑到这种房子本身的价值，这笔房租算是相当高了。我发现杰克逊确实像欧内斯特描述的那样，是一个温顺又低声下气的人。他正做着某种藤器，就连我跟他说话时，他还是麻木地干着他的活。尽管他还是那样温顺而低声下气，但当他对我说出第一句话的时候，我觉得我听出了他埋在心中的怨恨，他说：“不管怎样，他们可以给我个看门的差事。”</td>
		<td class="en">They invariably paid rent, and, considering the value of such houses, enormous rent, to the landlords.I found Jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described.He was making some sort of rattan-work, and he toiled on stolidly while I talked with him.But in spite of his meekness and lowliness, I fancied I caught the first note of a nascent bitterness in him when he said:‘They might a-given me a job as watchman,(2) anyway.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我没有从他身上打听出多少东西。他给我的印象好像为人蠢笨，可是他用一只手干起活来也很灵活，这证明他其实并不笨。这提醒了我一件事。</td>

		<td class="en">‘How did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine?’ I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他慢慢地、若有所思地望着我，然后摇摇头。“我不知道。事情就这样发生了。”</td>
		<td class="en">He looked at me in a slow and pondering way, and shook his head.‘I don’t know.It just happened.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不小心吗？”我提示他说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Carelessness?’ I prompted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，”他说，“我不认为是我不小心。我正在加班，我想那个时候我是累坏了。我在他们的厂里干了十七年了，我留意到大多数事故都发生在快要鸣笛下班时。我敢打赌，在鸣笛之前的一个小时里发生的事故远比在其他时间要多。几个小时干下来，一个人总会不大利索了。我看过太多人给轧过、碾过，绞得稀巴烂。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘No,’ he answered, ‘I ain’t for callin’ it that.I was workin’ overtime, an’ I guess I was tired out some.I worked seventeen years in them mills, an’ I’ve took notice that most of the accidents happens just before whistle-blow.(3)I’m willin’ to bet that more accidents happens in the hour before whistle-blow than in all the rest of the day.A man ain’t so quick after workin’ steady for hours.I’ve seen too many of ‘em cut up an’ gouged an’ chawed not to know.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很多人吗？”我问。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“成千上万啊，还有许多是孩子。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Hundreds an’ hundreds, an’ children, too.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了那些可怕的细节外，杰克逊的意外事件与我所听到的完全相同。当我问他有没有违反机器的操作规程时，他摇了摇头。“我右手扯掉皮带，”他说，“左手去捡那块石头，我没有停下来去瞧一瞧皮带扯下来没有。我以为我的右手已经把它扯掉了，只是并没有。我迅速伸手过去，可皮带并没有完全被扯下来。然后，我的胳膊给轧掉了。”</td>
		<td class="en">With the exception of the terrible details, Jackson’s story of his accident was the same as that I had already heard.When I asked him if he had broken some rule of working the machinery, he shook his head.‘I chucked off the belt with my right hand,’ he said, ‘an’ made a reach for the flint with my left.I didn’t stop to see if the belt was off.I thought my right hand had done it—only it didn’t.I reached quick, and the belt wasn’t all the way off.And then my arm was chewed off.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那一定很痛吧。”我同情地说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘It must have been painful,’ I said sympathetically.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“骨头给轧断的滋味可不好受。”他答道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘The crunchin’ of the bones wasn’t nice,’ was his answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >关于那场索赔诉讼，他已记不清了。只有一件事他非常清楚，那就是他没有得到任何赔偿金。他觉得是工头和管理员的证言让法庭作出了对他不利的判决。据他所说，他们的证言“与事实不符”。因此，我决定去找他们。</td>
		<td class="en">His mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit.Only one thing was clear to him, and that was that he had not got any damages.He had a feeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had brought about the adverse decision of the court.Their testimony, as he put it, ‘wasn’t what it ought to have ben.’ And to them I resolved to go.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一件事很明显，那就是杰克逊的处境很凄惨。他的妻子生病了，而他又失去了赚钱的能力，仅靠卖藤制品还不足以养活全家。他欠着房租，而他的大儿子——一个十一岁的小家伙，已经开始在厂里干活了。</td>
		<td class="en">One thing was plain, Jackson’s situation was wretched.His wife was in ill health, and he was unable to earn, by his rattan-work and peddling, sufficient food for the family.He was back in his rent, and the oldest boy, a lad of eleven, had started to work in the mills.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我走的时候，他说的最后一句话是：“他们该给我个看门的差事。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘They might a-given me that watchman’s job,’ were his last words as I went away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我见到那个受理杰克逊一案的律师和出庭作证的那两个厂里的工头和管理员时，我开始觉得欧内斯特的话有些道理了。</td>
		<td class="en">By the time I had seen the lawyer who had handled Jackson’s case, and the two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had testified, I began to feel that there was something after all in Ernest’s contention.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个律师很软弱，看上去不中用，我一看到他，就明白为什么杰克逊的案子会败诉了。我脑子里闪过的第一念头是，杰克逊请这样一个律师也真是活该。但下一刻，欧内斯特说的两句话在我的脑海里闪过：“公司方面请的是十分能干的律师”，还有“英格拉姆上校是个精明的律师”。我迅速地思考了一下。我想到，公司方面当然比杰克逊那样的工人请得起更高明的律师。但是这只是小细节。我确信，杰克逊的败诉一定还有更重要的原因。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a weak and inefficient-looking man, the lawyer, and at sight of him I did not wonder that Jackson’s case had been lost.But this knowledge stopped with the working class.But the next moment two of Ernest’s statements came flashing into my consciousness: ‘The company employs very efficient lawyers’ and ‘Colonel Ingram is a shrewd lawyer.’I did some rapid thinking.It dawned upon me that of course the company could afford finer legal talent than could a workingman like Jackson.But this was merely a minor detail.There was some very good reason, I was sure, why Jackson’s case had gone against him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你为什么输了官司？”我问。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why did you lose the case?’ I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >律师不知所措，焦虑了好一会儿。我发现自己发自内心地可怜这不幸的家伙。接着，他开始发牢骚。我坚信发牢骚是他的天赋。他生来就是失败者。他哀怨地向我诉说那次作证的经过。目击者们只提供对另一方有利的证据。从他们那里连一个对杰克逊有利的字都得不到。他们清楚谁在养着他们。杰克逊真是个傻瓜。他完全被英格拉姆上校吓唬住了，被弄得晕头转向。英格拉姆上校在对质时尽显才智。他逼得杰克逊频频答错。</td>
		<td class="en">The lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment, and I found it in my heart to pity the wretched little creature.Then he began to whine. I do believe his whine was congenital.He was a man beaten at birth.He whined about the testimony.The witnesses had given only the evidence that helped the other side.Not one word could he get out of them that would have helped Jackson.They knew which side their bread was buttered on.Jackson was a fool.He had been brow-beaten and confused by Colonel Ingram.Colonel Ingram was brilliant at cross-examination.He had made Jackson answer damaging questions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要是道理在他这里，他怎么可能错了呢？”我责问。</td>
		<td class="en">‘How could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his side?’I demanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这跟道理有什么关系？”他反问我。“你瞧这一大堆书，”他用手指向他狭小办公室的墙上的一排排书籍，“我读过、研究过这些书，它们让我明白法律是一回事，道理是另一回事。你可以问任何一位律师。你去主日学校学什么是道理。但是你得读这些书来学……法律。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘What’s right got to do with it?’ he demanded back.‘You see all those books.’ He moved his hand over the array of volumes on the walls of his tiny office.‘All my reading and studying of them has taught me that law is one thing and right is another thing.Ask any lawyer.You go to Sunday-school to learn what is right.But you go to those books to learn...law.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是不是想告诉我，尽管杰克逊有道理，可他还是败诉了？”我试探地问道，“你的意思是说，考德威尔法官的法庭上根本没有公正吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Do you mean to tell me that Jackson had the right on his side and yet was beaten?’ I queried tentatively.‘Do you mean to tell me that there is no justice in Judge Caldwell’s court?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个小律师瞪了我一眼，然后他脸上那富有挑衅意味的神情逐渐消失。“我连公平的机会都没有。”他又开始发牢骚，“他们把杰克逊当傻瓜，也把我当傻瓜。我有什么机会？英格拉姆上校是个了不起的律师。如果他没有能力，怎么能担任西拉纺织厂、厄斯顿地产公司、伯克利联合公司，还有奥克兰、圣莱安德罗、普莱曾顿电力公司等大企业的法律顾问呢？他是大企业的律师，人家花钱请大律师，可不想要大傻瓜啊。单单西拉纺织厂一家每年就给他两万块，你想这是为什么？因为对他们来说，他值一年两万块，这就是原因。我不值那么多。要是我值那么多钱，我也不会在外面跑，成天饿肚子，还要受理像杰克逊这样的案子。要是我帮杰克逊打赢官司，你觉得我能得到什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">The little lawyer glared at me a moment, and then the belligerence faded out of his face.‘I hadn’t a fair chance,’ he began whining again.‘They made a fool out of Jackson and out of me, too.What chance had I?Colonel Ingram is a great lawyer.If he wasn’t great, would he have charge of the law business of the Sierra Mills, of the Erston Land Syndicate, of the Berkeley Consolidated, of the Oakland, San Leandro, and Pleasanton Electric?He’s a corporation lawyer, and corporation lawyers are not paid for being fools.(4)What do you think the Sierra Mills alone give him twenty thousand dollars a year for?Because he’s worth twenty thousand dollars a year to them, that’s what for.I’m not worth that much.If I was, I wouldn’t be on the outside, starving and taking cases like Jackson’s.What do you think I’d have got if I’d won Jackson’s case?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你会敲他一笔钱，很有可能。”我回答。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You’d have robbed him, most probably,’ I answered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然，我会的。”他气愤地叫着，“我也要生活啊，不是吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Of course I would,’ he cried angrily.‘I’ve got to live, haven’t I?’(5)</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他有妻子和孩子啊。”我斥责道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘He has a wife and children,’ I chided.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也有妻儿啊。”他反驳道，“世界上除了我，谁会关心他们有没有饿肚子。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘So have I a wife and children,’ he retorted.‘And there’s not a soul in this world except myself that cares whether they starve or not.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的脸色突然柔和起来。他打开表盖，给我看粘在表盖上的一张小相片，相片上是一个女人和两个小女孩。“这就是她们。你瞧瞧她们。我们的日子真不好过，不好过啊。我原本打算，如果打赢了杰克逊的官司，我就把她们送到乡下去住。在这儿，她们身体不好，可我又没钱把她们送走。”</td>
		<td class="en">His face suddenly softened, and he opened his watch and showed me a small photograph of a woman and two little girls pasted inside the case.‘There they are.Look at them.We’ve had a hard time, a hard time.I had hoped to send them away to the country if I’d won Jackson’s case.They’re not healthy here, but I can’t afford to send them away.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我临走的时候，他又开始牢骚了。</td>
		<td class="en">When I started to leave, he dropped back into his whine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我跟本就没有机会。英格拉姆上校和考德威尔法官颇有交情。我不是说如果我能在对质时从对方证人那里获取些有利证词我就能打赢官司，而是说他们的交情才是决定这场官司成败的关键。但我必须说，考德威尔法官千方百计地阻挠我得到有利证词。为什么，因为考德威尔法官和英格拉姆上校是同一个社团和俱乐部的会员。他们住在同一个住宅区——一个我住不起的地方。而且他们的太太常常互相走动。他们总是轮流举办牌友会什么的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I hadn’t the ghost of a chance.Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell are pretty friendly.I’m not saying that if I’d got the right kind of testimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination, that friendship would have decided the case.And yet I must say that Judge Caldwell did a whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony.Why, Judge Caldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club.They live in the same neighborhood—one I can’t afford.And their wives are always in and out of each other’s houses.They’re always having whist parties and such things back and forth.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是，你还是认为杰克逊是有道理的，对吗？”我在门槛处停了一会儿，问他。</td>
		<td class="en">‘And yet you think Jackson had the right of it?’ I asked, pausing for the moment on the threshold.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不是认为，而是明确地知道。”他回答，“起先，我也觉得他可能有些机会。但是我没有告诉我妻子。我不想让她失望。尽管这很困难，但她还是一心想到乡下去。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I don’t think; I know it,’ was his answer.‘And at first I thought he had some show, too.But I didn’t tell my wife.I didn’t want to disappoint her.She had her heart set on a trip to the country hard enough as it was.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你为什么没有强调杰克逊当时这么做是为了防止机器损坏呢？”我问彼得·唐纳利，他是审讯时出庭作证的工头之一。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why did you not call attention to the fact that Jackson was trying to save the machinery from being injured?’ I asked Peter Donnelly, one of the foremen who had testified at the trial.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他沉思了好一会儿才开口。他不安地四下望了望，说：</td>
		<td class="en">He pondered a long time before replying.Then he cast an anxious look about him and said:</td></tr>

Convention, the Bishop, being a gentle soul, had yielded to the friendly pressure brought to bear upon him, and had gone away on a vacation.But he returned more fixed than ever in his determination to preach the message of the Church.To the consternation of his congregation, his first sermon was quite similar to the address he had given before the Convention.Again he said, and at length and with distressing detail, that the Church had wandered away from the Master’s teaching, and that Mammon had been instated in the place of Christ.</td></tr>
