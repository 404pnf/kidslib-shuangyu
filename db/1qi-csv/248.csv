"英格兰，我的英格兰","England, My England"
"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯","by D. H. Lawrence"
"他正在小溪那边的公地边上干活。这条小溪沿着花园尽头的凹地流淌，把花园的小径从木板桥一直引向了公地。他砍掉了高矮不一的草皮和欧洲蕨，露出灰色的、有点干的泥土。但他无法把这条小径弄直，所以很担心，还皱起了眉头。他已经竖立起了树枝，并在大棵的松树之间瞄了多次，但是不知是什么原因，一切看起来都不对。他又看了一次，睁大他那双敏锐的蓝眼睛，眼里带着一丝北欧海盗的神情。就像透过一扇门一样，透过郁郁葱葱的松树，他看到长满绿草的花园小径从圆木桥旁边的桤木的树阴下向上延伸，直到阳光照耀下的花朵那里。在一片荒野上丛花盛开，其间蜷伏着高大的白紫色耧斗菜和古老的汉普郡小屋的一角。","He was working on the edge of the common, beyond the small brook that ran in the dip at the bottom of the garden, carrying the garden path in continuation from the plank bridge on to the common.He had cut the rough turf and bracken, leaving the grey, dryish soil bare.But he was worried because he could not get the path straight, there was a pleat between his brows.He had set up his sticks, and taken the sights between the big pine trees, but for some reason everything seemed wrong.He looked again, straining his keen blue eyes, that had a touch of the Viking in them, through the shadowy pine trees as through a doorway, at the green-grassed garden-path rising from the shadow of alders by the log bridge up to the sunlit flowers.Tall white and purple columbines, and the butt-end of the old Hampshire cottage that crouched near the earth amid flowers, blossoming in the bit of shaggy wildness round about."
"那边有小孩叫喊声和说话声。是那种高亢而稚气的女孩的声音。只听她带着一点教训的口气，盛气凌人地说：“如果你不快点过来，保姆，我就要跑出去，到有蛇的地方去。”没有人会无动于衷地回答说“那就跑吧，小傻瓜”。人们总会说“不，亲爱的。很好，亲爱的。等一会儿，亲爱的。亲爱的，你必须耐心点”。","There was a sound of children’s voices calling and talking: high, childish, girlish voices, slightly didactic and tinged with domineering: ‘If you don’t come quick, nurse, I shall run out there to where there are snakes.’And nobody had the sangfroid to reply: ‘Run then, little fool.’It was always, ‘No, darling.Very well, darling.In a moment, darling.Darling, you must be patient.’"
"他的心忍受着幻想破灭的痛苦：一种持续的折磨和煎熬。但他继续干活。除了屈服，他还能做什么！","His heart was hard with disillusion: a continual gnawing and resistance.But he worked on.What was there to do but submit!"
"阳光照耀在大地上，植被鲜艳如火，与原始、寂静的公地彻底隔绝开来。很奇怪原始的英格兰是如何一小块一小块地留存下来的：在这里,它留存在这些粗糙蓬松的荆豆公地中,留存在南部丘陵脚下那群蛇聚集的沼泽地里。这地方的精神保留着原始的风格，就像很久以前撒克逊人来的时候那样。","The sunlight blazed down upon the earth, there was a vividness of flamy vegetation, of fierce seclusion amid the savage peace of the commons.Strange how the savage England lingers in patches: as here, amid these shaggy gorse commons, and marshy, snake infested places near the foot of the south downs.The spirit of place lingering on primeval, as when the Saxons came, so long ago."
"啊，他是多么爱它啊！绿色的花园小径、一簇簇花朵、白紫相间的耧斗菜、长着黑萼的大朵东方红罂粟，还有高大的黄色毛蕊花——这个色彩绚烂的花园在一千年前就已经是花园了，它屹立在这块小洼地里，周围则是群蛇聚集的公地。他用篱笆和树木把花园围成了一只阳光灿烂的“杯子”，还在园里种满了绚丽的花朵。这是多么古老，多么古老的一个地方！而今，他已赋予了它新的生命。","Ah, how he had loved it!The green garden path, the tufts of flowers, purple and white columbines, and great oriental red poppies with their black chaps and mulleins tall and yellow, this flamy garden which had been a garden for a thousand years, scooped out in the little hollow among the snake-infested commons.He had made it flame with flowers, in a sun cup under its hedges and trees.So old, so old a place!And yet he had re-created it."
"那些带着倾斜的斗篷状屋顶的木屋已经老旧，早已被人遗忘。它属于古英格兰的小村庄和自耕农。它被孤零零地遗忘在公地的边缘，遗忘在在这条宽阔的、杂草丛生的、橡树遮蔽的荆棘小路的尽头。它对当今的世界一无所知。直到埃格伯特带着他的新娘来到这里，它才重现生机。他逐渐在这里种满了花。","The timbered cottage with its sloping, cloak-like roof was old and forgotten.It belonged to the old England of hamlets and yeomen.Lost all alone on the edge of the common, at the end of a wide, grassy, briar-entangled lane shaded with oak, it had never known the world of today.Not till Egbert came with his bride.And he had come to fill it with flowers."
"屋子很古老、很不舒适。但他不想改变它。啊，到了晚上，当风从头顶呼啸而过，当他亲自砍伐的木材在壁炉里噼啪作响的时候，坐在那宽大而古老的黑壁炉旁边，是多么的美妙啊！他自己坐在角落的一边，威妮弗雷德坐在另一边。","The house was ancient and very uncomfortable.But he did not want to alter it.Ah, marvellous to sit there in the wide, black, time-old chimney, at night when the wind roared overhead, and the wood which he had chopped himself sputtered on the hearth!Himself on one side the angle, and Winifred on the other."
"啊，他多么需要她——威妮弗雷德！她年轻、漂亮、充满活力，像旭日的光芒。她举手投足间充满活力、风度优雅，像一丛开满红花的灌木在翩翩起舞。她似乎也来自古老的英格兰，红润、强健，一丝天然的沉静中透着激情，像山楂树一般坚实。而他，身材高大、体形修长、动作敏捷，有着长而灵巧的双腿和优雅的举止，像一个英格兰弓箭手。她的头发是栗色的，全都呈现出丰盈有力的卷曲状。她的眼睛也是栗色的，和知更鸟的眼睛一样明亮。他皮肤白皙，头发纤细、柔顺，发色比金色略深。他的鼻子微微勾起，带着古老的乡村家族的特征。他们是漂亮的一对。","Ah, how he had wanted her: Winifred!She was young and beautiful and strong with life, like a flame in sunshine.She moved with a slow grace of energy like a blossoming, red-flowered bush in motion.She, too, seemed to come out of the old England, ruddy, strong, with a certain crude, passionate quiescence and a hawthorn robustness.And he, he was tall and slim and agile, like an English archer with his long supple legs and fine movements.Her hair was nut-brown and all in energic curls and tendrils.Her eyes were nut-brown, too, like a robin’s for brightness.And he was white-skinned with fine, silky hair that had darkened from fair, and a slightly arched nose of an old country family.They were a beautiful couple."
"房子是威妮弗雷德的。她父亲也是一个充满活力的人。他家境贫苦，来自北方。现在，他还算得上富裕。他在汉普郡买下了这一大块地，而且花费不多。在这个几乎无人到访的乡村小教堂的不远处，矗立着他的房子。这是一栋宽敞而古老的农舍。房子在路后面，和路之间隔着一块光秃秃的草地。在这个四方院落的一边，是长长的谷仓，或者说是棚子，他已经把它改建成了一间小屋，让小女儿普里西拉居住。在长长的窗户上，你会看见蓝白相间的小方格窗帘。进了屋，抬头就能看到尖顶上用的大块的老木料。这是普里西拉的屋子。五十码开外，有栋漂亮小巧的新屋子，是他为女儿玛格黛伦修建的，它的菜园一直延伸到橡树林。远处，在庭园的草坪和玫瑰树丛外边，有一条小径。它穿过一片野草丛生的空地，朝堤岸上高耸的黑松树岭的方向延伸，再穿过这片松树，越过一片倾斜的小泥地，穿过宽大、寂寥的橡树林，一直通到威妮弗雷德的小屋。这座猛然出现在路前的小屋是如此的孤独，如此的简陋。那是威妮弗雷德自己的房子。花园、那块公地，还有泥泞的斜坡都是她的：她的小领地。差不多在战争爆发十年前，她父亲买下了这块房产。她就是在那时结了婚。所以她才能在与埃格伯特结婚时用这块地当结婚嫁妆。谁更高兴，是他还是她，就难说了。她当时只有二十岁，而他只有二十一岁。他自己每年有一百五十英镑——还有着可观的个人魅力，此外，他便一无所有。他没有职业：他没有薪水。但他谈论文学和音乐。他酷爱古老的民间音乐，还爱收集民间歌曲和舞蹈，热衷于研究莫里斯舞和古老的风俗。当然，他迟早会在这些方面挣钱的。","The house was Winifred’s.Her father was a man of energy, too.He had come from the north poor.Now he was moderately rich.He had bought this fair stretch of inexpensive land, down in Hampshire.Not far from the tiny church of the almost extinct hamlet stood his own house, a commodious old farmhouse standing back from the road across a bare grassed yard.On one side of this quadrangle was the long, long barn or shed which he had made into a cottage for his youngest daughter Priscilla.One saw little blue-and-white check curtains at the long windows, and inside, overhead, the grand old timbers of the high-pitched shed.This was Prissy’s house.Fifty yards away was the pretty little new cottage which he had built for his daughter Magdalen, with the vegetable garden stretching away to the oak copse.And then away beyond the lawns and rose trees of the house-garden went the track across a shaggy, wild grass space, towards the ridge of tall black pines that grew on a dyke-bank, through the pines and above the sloping little bog, under the wide, desolate oak trees, till there was Winifred’s cottage crouching unexpectedly in front, so much alone, and so primitive.It was Winifred’s own house, and the gardens and the bit of common and the boggy slope were hers: her tiny domain.She had married just at the time when her father had bought the estate, about ten years before the war, so she had been able to come to Egbert with this for a marriage portion.And who was more delighted, he or she, it would be hard to say.She was only twenty at the time, and he was only twenty-one.He had about a hundred and fifty pounds a year of his own—and nothing else but his very considerable personal attractions.He had no profession: he earned nothing.But he talked of literature and music, he had a passion for old folk-music, collecting folk-songs and folk-dances, studying the Morris-dance and the old customs.Of course in time he would make money in these ways."
"同时他还有青春、健康、激情和希望。威妮弗雷德的父亲总是很慷慨：不过，他还是一个来自北方的男人，有着精明的头脑和强壮的体格，经受过很多挫折。在家里，他把精明的头脑放在一边，来和他那爱好文学的妻子，还有他那些健壮、活泼的女儿们用诗歌和故事消遣。他是个勇敢的男人，从不抱怨，独自承受着重担。不，他不让世俗过多地侵入他的家庭。他有一个娇柔、敏感的妻子，她的诗作在文人的小圈子里颇有名声。他自己，带着他一贯的顽强而野蛮的斗志，对韵文、甜美的诗歌，以及书香门第常玩的快乐的游戏都心怀一种孩子似的喜爱。他血气方刚，甚至有些粗鄙。但那只会让这个家庭更有生机，更加稳固，更加有欢快的圣诞气息。他身上总是有种圣诞节的欢乐气息。而今，他富裕了。如果晚饭后有诗歌活动，就会有巧克力和坚果，还有其他新奇、好吃的小零食，可以大嚼一通。","Meanwhile youth and health and passion and promise.Winifred’s father was always generous: but still, he was a man from the north with a hard head and a hard skin too, having received a good many knocks.At home he kept the hard head out of sight, and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy, passionate girls.He was a man of courage, not given to complaining, bearing his burdens by himself.No, he did not let the world intrude far into his home.He had a delicate, sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters.He himself, with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit, had an almost child-like delight in verse, in sweet poetry, and in the delightful game of a cultured home.His blood was strong even to coarseness.But that only made the home more vigorous, more robust and Christmassy.There was always a touch of Christmas about him, now he was well off.If there was poetry after dinner, there were also chocolates and nuts, and good little out-of-the-way things to be munching."
"后来，埃格伯特成为了这个家庭的一员。他生来就是另一种类型的人。女孩们和的父亲是四肢强健、血气方刚的人，是真正的英格兰人，正如冬青树和山楂是英格兰的一样。她们的修养是嫁接到她们身上的，就像有人可能会把一枝普通的粉红色玫瑰嫁接到荆棘茎上一样。这种修养开出了很怪异的花，却没有改变她们的血统。","Well then, into this family came Egbert.He was made of quite a different paste.The girls and the father were strong-limbed, thick-blooded people, true English, as holly-trees and hawthorn are English.Their culture was grafted on to them, as one might perhaps graft a common pink rose on to a thornstem.It flowered oddly enough, but it did not alter their blood."
"埃格伯特天生是株玫瑰。长年累月的教化已经在他身上留下了一种令人愉快的、自然流露的情感。他并不聪明，更没什么“文学气息”。是没什么，可是他说话的腔调、灵巧的举止、健美的身材、细腻的皮肤、良好的发质、微翘的鼻子，以及敏锐的蓝眼睛可以轻易地弥补诗意的缺失。威妮弗雷德爱他，爱他这个南方人，把他当成高等人来爱。你要知道，是一个高等人。不是一个低等人。而他也全心全意地爱着她。","And Egbert was a born rose.The age-long breeding had left him with a delightful spontaneous passion.He was not clever, nor even ‘literary’.No, but the intonation of his voice, and the movement of his supple, handsome body, and the fine texture of his flesh and his hair, the slight arch of his nose, the quickness of his blue eyes would easily take the place of poetry.Winifred loved him, loved him, this southerner, as a higher being.A higher being, mind you.Not a deeper.And as for him, he loved her in passion with every fibre of him."
"她就是他生活中温暖的源泉。那时很美好——那些在克罗坎小屋度过的日子，那些最初的日子——除了早上来干活的女佣，只有他俩在一起。在那些绝妙的日子里，她独自享有他全部的青春活力：修长的身躯，灵巧的动作，还有那光滑的肌肤。而他把她变成了一团通红的火焰，他愿投身其中，获得重生。啊，但愿这些永远不会结束，这激情，这婚姻！他们两人身体的烈焰再次燃烧在那间古老的小屋里，那间曾经弥漫着诸多肉欲的小屋。你不可能在那黑暗的房间里呆了一小时还毫无欲念。这间古老的巢穴见证了一代又一代情欲似火的自耕农在此纵欲，在此繁衍。这间屋子黑暗而沉寂，围着厚厚的木墙，摆着巨大的黑火炉，给人一种神秘的感觉。屋子半在地下，低矮的小窗户让屋里显得十分黑暗。对一代代自耕农来说，屋子黑暗得像一个猛兽潜伏和交配的巢穴。度过孤独的夜晚和白天，剩下的只有他们自己和自己的欲望。这似乎在这两个年轻人身上施加了魔法。他们变了。他们周围出现了一种奇妙的神秘光辉，一种莫名的、沉睡的火焰将他们包裹了起来。他们也感觉到自己已经不属于伦敦的世界了。克罗坎改变了他们的血液：当他感觉到那些蛇甚至光天化日下栖息在他们花园里时，就拿起铲子走过去，他会在黑土地上看到一个盘曲的、怪异的棕色物体。这物体会突然惊跳起来，嘶嘶作响，然后迅速游离，一路嘶嘶作响。一天，威妮弗雷德听到一声极其奇怪的尖叫声，那声音来自客厅矮窗下的花坛那边：啊，那是最奇怪的尖叫声，就像是一个在黑暗的过去饱受折磨的幽灵在高声哭喊。她跑出去，看见花坛上有一条褐色的长蛇，在它扁平的嘴里，露出一只青蛙的一条后腿。这青蛙正在挣扎着逃离，同时发出一种奇怪、细小的怒吼声。她看着蛇，而蛇也用它那扁平的深色脑袋固执地看着她。她大喊一声，蛇便松开了青蛙，生气地游开了。","She was the very warm stuff of life to him.Wonderful then, those days at Crockham Cottage, the first days, all alone save for the woman who came to work in the mornings.Marvellous days, when she had all his tall, supple, fine-fleshed youth to herself, for herself, and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation.Ah, that it might never end, this passion, this marriage!The flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage, that was haunted already by so much by-gone, physical desire.You could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you.The hot blood-desire of by-gone yeomen, there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations.The silent house, dark, with thick, timbered walls and the big black chimney-place, and the sense of secrecy.Dark, with low, little windows, sunk into the earth.Dark, like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated, lonely at night and lonely by day, left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations.It seemed to cast a spell on the two young people.They became different.There was a curious secret glow about them, a certain slumbering flame hard to understand, that enveloped them both.They too felt that they did not belong to the London world any more.Crockham had changed their blood: the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden, in the sun, so that he, going forward with the spade, would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil, which suddenly would start up, hiss, and dazzle rapidly away, hissing.One day Winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower-bed under the low window of the living room: ah, the strangest scream, like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud.She ran out, and saw a long brown snake on the flower-bed, and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape, and screaming its strange, tiny, bellowing scream.She looked at the snake, and from its sullen flat head it looked at her, obstinately.She gave a cry, and it released the frog and slid angrily away."
"那就是克罗坎。现代发明的“长矛”并没有刺穿它。它神秘地躺在那里，原始而荒芜，就像撒克逊人刚来的时候一样。而埃格伯特和她被它吸引，远离尘嚣。","That was Crockham.The spear of modern invention had not passed through it, and it lay there secret, primitive, savage as when the Saxons first came.And Egbert and she were caught there, caught out of the world."
"他没有闲着，她也没有。有很多事情要做。工匠们走了以后，他们要对屋子进行最后的修补，要缝制坐垫和窗帘，要开路，要取水并检修水管，还要把土层肥厚、无人照料的花园里的斜坡放平并修葺成阶梯状，再铺上小台阶和小径，并栽满花朵。他不停地干活，只穿着衬衣，整天不停地一会儿做这事，一会儿做那事。而她的内心平静而充实。看着他独自弯腰劳作，她会过来帮他，好与他亲近。他自然很业余——天生就很业余。他干得非常卖力，却没有多少成效，而且他做好的东西都维持不了多久。要是他来把花园修葺成阶梯状的话，他会用几块狭长的木板挡住泥土。可是木板很快就会因为后面的压力而弯曲，很快就会烂穿、折断——根本不需要长年累月的腐蚀——而泥土就会全部重新滑落成堆状，遥遥对着河床。可是你要知道。他并不是从小就学过怎样应付所有事情，而且他也以为那样做会有用。他也不觉得需要做什么别的，只要做一些临时的小装置即可，因为他是如此热爱他那不朽的旧屋子，热爱过去英格兰那些不朽的旧东西。奇怪的是，他是如此钟爱耐久不变的旧东西，而他在现实生活里做东西时却这么业余和粗略。","He was not idle, nor was she.There were plenty of things to be done, the house to be put into final repair after the workmen had gone, cushions and curtains to sew, the paths to make, the water to fetch and attend to, and then the slope of the deep-soiled, neglected garden to level, to terrace with little terraces and paths, and to fill with flowers.He worked away, in his shirt-sleeves, worked all day intermittently doing this thing and the other.And she, quiet and rich in herself, seeing him stooping and labouring away by himself, would come to help him, to be near him.He of course was an amateur—a born amateur.He worked so hard, and did so little, and nothing he ever did would hold together for long.If he terraced the garden, he held up the earth with a couple of long narrow planks that soon began to bend with the pressure from behind, and would not need many years to rot through and break and let the soil slither all down again in a heap towards the stream-bed.But there you are.He had not been brought up to come to grips with anything, and he thought it would do.Nay, he did not think there was anything else except little temporary contrivances possible, he who had such a passion for his old enduring cottage, and for the old enduring things of the bygone England.Curious that the sense of permanency in the past had such a hold over him, whilst in the present he was all amateurish and sketchy."
"威妮弗雷德不会批评他。对于在城市长大的她，这里的一切似乎都很美妙，连挖土和挥铲看起来都那么浪漫。但是埃格伯特和她都还没有意识到干活和浪漫之间的不同。她父亲，戈弗雷·马歇尔，最初对克罗坎小屋的这个小家庭十分满意。他认为埃格伯特很不错，做了很多事。看到这两个年轻人焕发着肉体的激情，他感到很满足。对于这个还在伦敦努力工作好让不多的财产得以保值的人来说，一想到在公地和沼泽深处，若隐若现的丘陵山峦附近的克罗坎小屋里，这对年轻夫妇在苦干不止、互相爱慕，他就好像看到了一篇栩栩如生的浪漫史。","Winifred could not criticize him.Town-bred, everything seemed to her splendid, and the very digging and shovelling itself seemed romantic.But neither Egbert nor she yet realized the difference between work and romance.Godfrey Marshall, her father, was at first perfectly pleased with the menage down at Crockham Cottage.He thought Egbert was wonderful, the many things he accomplished, and he was gratified by the glow of physical passion between the two young people.To the man who in London still worked hard to keep steady his modest fortune, the thought of this young couple digging away and loving one another down at Crockham Cottage, buried deep among the commons and marshes, near the pale-showing bulk of the downs, was like a chapter of living romance."
"而他们也从这位老人身上获得了维系激情之火的燃料。是他在为他们添柴加火。他在为这个想法而暗自得意。威妮弗雷德依旧求助于她父亲，把他当作一切保障、全部生活，以及所有依靠的唯一来源。她深爱着埃格伯特。但在她身后，是她父亲的力量。每当她需要帮助的时候，她总会去寻求她父亲的力量。如果她遇到困难或疑问，她从没想过要去找埃格伯特。没有，在所有重大的事情上，她都依靠她的父亲。","And they drew the sustenance for their fire of passion from him, from the old man.It was he who fed their flame.He triumphed secretly in the thought.And it was to her father that Winifred still turned, as the one source of all surety and life and support.She loved Egbert with passion.But behind her was the power of her father.It was the power of her father she referred to, whenever she needed to refer.It never occurred to her to refer to Egbert, if she were in difficulty or doubt.No, in all the serious matters she depended on her father."
"因为埃格伯特不想去掌控生活。他没什么野心。他来自一个体面的家庭，一个快乐的乡村之家，在愉快的环境中成长。当然，他本应该有个职业的。他本应学习法律或以某种方式进入商界。但他并没这样做——只要他还活着，那不可或缺的一周三英镑就能让他免于挨饿，况且他也不想作茧自缚。他并非无所事事。他总是在以他业余的方式做着点什么。但是他没有入世的愿望，更没有要出去闯荡一番的欲望。不，不，这世界不值得他这样做。他想无视这个世界，走自己的路，就像一个随心所欲的朝圣者，走在无人行走的旁道上。他爱他的妻子，他的小屋和花园。他要在那里过他的日子，做一个安于享乐的隐士。他热爱过去，热爱古英格兰的旧式音乐、舞蹈和习俗。他要努力生活在这样的氛围里，而不是在世俗世界的氛围里。","For Egbert had no intention of coming to grips with life.He had no ambition whatsoever.He came from a decent family, from a pleasant country home, from delightful surroundings.He should, of course, have had a profession.He should have studied law or entered business in some way.But no—that fatal three pounds a week would keep him from starving as long as he lived, and he did not want to give himself into bondage.It was not that he was idle.He was always doing something, in his amateurish way.But he had no desire to give himself to the world, and still less had he any desire to fight his way in the world.No, no, the world wasn’t worth it.He wanted to ignore it, to go his own way apart, like a casual pilgrim down the forsaken sidetracks.He loved his wife, his cottage and garden.He would make his life there, as a sort of epicurean hermit.He loved the past, the old music and dances and customs of old England.He would try and live in the spirit of these, not in the spirit of the world of business."
"但是威妮弗雷德的父亲经常把她叫到伦敦去：因为他喜欢让自己的孩子在身边。所以埃格伯特和她必须在城里有一间小公寓。这对年轻的夫妇必须时不时地从乡下来到城里。在城里，埃格伯特有一大群朋友，他们跟他一样无所事事，整天摆弄艺术、文学、绘画、雕刻和音乐。他并不觉得厌烦。","But often Winifred’s father called her to London: for he loved to have his children round him.So Egbert and she must have a tiny flat in town, and the young couple must transfer themselves from time to time from the country to the city.In town Egbert had plenty of friends, of the same ineffectual sort as himself, tampering with the arts, literature, painting, sculpture, music.He was not bored."
"然而，一周三英镑是无法支付这一切的。这些都是由威妮弗雷德的父亲支付的。他喜欢付钱。尽管他只给她少量的零用钱，但他会时不时地给她十英镑——或者给埃格伯特十英镑。所以他们都把这位老人看作生活的支柱。埃格伯特不介意受人恩惠和资助。只有当他感觉这个家庭由于钱变得有点太卑躬屈膝时，他才开始动怒。","Three pounds a week, however, would not pay for all this.Winifred’s father paid.He liked paying.He made her only a very small allowance, but he often gave her ten pounds—or gave Egbert ten pounds.So they both looked on the old man as the mainstay.Egbert didn’t mind being patronized and paid for.Only when he felt the family was a little too condescending, on account of money, he began to get huffy."
"接着，当然是孩子出生了：一个可爱的金发小女孩，头部如蓟花的冠毛那般轻盈。所有人都非常喜欢这个小孩。她是这个家庭里第一个精致的金色事物。她是一个小不点，有着和她父亲一样白皙、修长、美丽的四肢。随着她慢慢长大，她逐渐显现出了野生小雏菊那般活泼、优美的仪态。难怪马歇尔一家都喜欢这个小孩：他们给她取名叫乔伊斯。他们都有各自的优雅之处，但是那种优雅显得迟缓、相当笨重。他们都四肢粗壮、肤色偏暗、身材矮小。而现在他们中间出现了这样一个如樱草般轻盈的小孩。她本身就像一首小诗。","Then of course children came: a lovely little blonde daughter with a head of thistledown.Everybody adored the child.It was the first exquisite blonde thing that had come into the family, a little mite with the white, slim, beautiful limbs of its father, and as it grew up the dancing, dainty movement of a wild little daisy-spirit.No wonder the Marshalls all loved the child: they called her Joyce.They themselves had their own grace, but it was slow, rather heavy.They had everyone of them strong, heavy limbs and darkish skins, and they were short in stature.And now they had for one of their own this light little cowslip child.She was like a little poem in herself."
"然而，她带来了一个新的难题。威妮弗雷德得给她找个保姆。是的，是的，必须得找个保姆。这是家庭成员共同的决定。谁来支付保姆的费用？是外公——因为父亲自己没有挣钱。是的，外公会支付，就像他支付了所有的分娩费用那样。于是就有了一种手头拮据的感觉。埃格伯特在靠他的岳父过活。","But nevertheless, she brought a new difficulty.Winifred must have a nurse for her.Yes, yes, there must be a nurse.It was the family decree.Who was to pay for the nurse?The grandfather—seeing the father himself earned no money.Yes, the grandfather would pay, as he had paid all the lying-in expenses.There came a slight sense of money-strain.Egbert was living on his father-in-law."
"孩子出生以后，他和威妮弗雷德之间的关系就再也不是从前那样了。这种变化在开始时很难察觉。但是，它的确存在。首先，威妮弗雷德有了一个新的兴趣中心。她不打算溺爱她的孩子。但是她身为一位现代母亲，通常并不是用自然流露的爱来对待孩子，取而代之的是一种强烈的责任感。威妮弗雷德欣赏她心爱的小女儿，觉得自己对她有一种强烈的责任感。奇怪的是，这种责任感居然比她对丈夫的爱还要深刻。但原本就是如此。而且通常就是这样。在威妮弗雷德的心里，身为母亲的责任是首要责任，身为妻子的责任则远远落在后面。","After the child was born, it was never quite the same between him and Winifred.The difference was at first hardly perceptible.But it was there.In the first place Winifred had a new centre of interest.She was not going to adore her child.But she had what the modern mother so often has in the place of spontaneous love: a profound sense of duty towards her child.Winifred appreciated her darling little girl, and felt a deep sense of duty towards her.Strange, that this sense of duty should go deeper than the love for her husband.But so it was.And so it often is.The responsibility of motherhood was the prime responsibility in Winifred’s heart: the responsibility of wifehood came a long way second."
"孩子似乎再一次把她跟她原来的家庭系在了一条道上。她的父母、她自己，以及她的孩子，在她看来就是人类的三位一体。她丈夫？是，她仍然爱他。但是，那就好比游戏。她有一种简直毫无节制的责任感和家庭感。结婚以前，她作为人的首要责任是对他父亲而言的：他是支柱，是生活的来源，是永久的依靠。现在，责任链上新增了一个环节：她父亲、她自己和她的孩子。","Her child seemed to link her up again in a circuit with her own family.Her father and mother, herself, and her child, that was the human trinity for her.Her husband—?Yes, she loved him still.But that was like play.She had an almost barbaric sense of duty and of family.Till she married, her first human duty had been towards her father: he was the pillar, the source of life, the everlasting support.Now another link was added to the chain of duty: her father, herself, and her child."
"埃格伯特被排除在外。什么也没有发生，他却慢慢地、不知不觉地被排除在圈子之外。他的妻子仍然在肉体上爱着他。但是，但是——在性事上，他简直成了多余人。他不能埋怨威妮弗雷德。她仍然对他尽着义务。她仍然对他有肉体的激情，他也会全身心地投入到那种肉体的激情中。但是——但是——","Egbert was out of it.Without anything happening, he was gradually, unconsciously excluded from the circle.His wife still loved him, physically.But, but—he was almost the unnecessary party in the affair.He could not complain of Winifred.She still did her duty towards him.She still had a physical passion for him, that physical passion on which he had put all his life and soul.But—but—"
"在很长一段时间里，“但是”这个词反复出现。接着，第二个孩子出生了。又是一个惹人喜爱的金发小家伙，她不像乔伊斯那么高傲、那么火辣——在安纳贝尔出生后，埃格伯特开始真正意识到是怎么回事了。他的妻子仍然爱他。但是——现在已经出现了无数个“但是”——对她而言，对他肉体上的爱已经退居其次了。它已经变得没那么重要了。毕竟，她拥有这种肉体的激情至今已有两年了。人不是靠这种激情而活着。不，不——还有更严峻、更真实的东西。","It was for a long while an ever-recurring but.And then, after the second child, another blonde, winsome touching little thing, not so proud and flame-like as Joyce—after Annabel came, then Egbert began truly to realize how it was.His wife still loved him.But—and now the but had grown enormous—her physical love for him was of secondary importance to her.It became ever less important.After all, she had had it, this physical passion, for two years now.It was not this that one lived from.No, no—something sterner, realer."
"她开始憎恶自己对埃格伯特的激情——她开始有点鄙视它。可无论如何，他还是那样，还是那么的迷人、可爱，还是那么能勾起人的欲望。但是——但是——噢，这如乌云般挥之不去的、可恶的“但是”！——在她生活的风景里，他并不是像擎天巨柱般坚定地耸立着的力量之塔。不，他就像一只被人养在屋子里的猫，总有一天会消失得无影无踪。他就像花园里的一朵花，在生命之风中颤抖，最后消失，什么也不留下。作为一件配件和饰品而言，他是完美的。很多女人都会喜欢有他相伴一生，把他当做全部财物中最漂亮、最满意的一件。然而威妮弗雷德不是这一类人。","She began to resent her own passion for Egbert—just a little she began to despise it.For after all there he was, he was charming, he was lovable, he was terribly desirable.But—but—oh, the awful looming cloud of that but!—he did not stand firm in the landscape of her life like a tower of strength, like a great pillar of significance.No, he was like a cat one has about the house, which will one day disappear and leave no trace.He was like a flower in the garden, trembling in the wind of life, and then gone, leaving nothing to show.As an adjunct, as an accessory, he was perfect.Many a woman would have adored to have him about her all her life, the most beautiful and desirable of all her possessions.But Winifred belonged to another school."
"年复一年，他并没有更多地掌控生活，反而更加松懈了。他天性细致、敏感、富有激情。但他就是不愿意投身到威妮弗雷德称之为生活的工作中去。不，他不愿意进入俗世，为了钱而工作。不，他就是不愿意。如果威妮弗雷德想要过他们这点收入负担不起的那种生活的话——那么，那就是她自己的事了。","The years went by, and instead of coming more to grips with life, he relaxed more.He was of a subtle, sensitive, passionate nature.But he simply would not give himself to what Winifred called life, Work.No, he would not go into the world and work for money.No, he just would not.If Winifred liked to live beyond their small income—well, it was her look-out."
"而且威妮弗雷德并非真的想要他出去为了钱而工作。哎呀，钱这个词似乎成了他们之间的燧木，点燃了他俩的怒火。不过这么说是因为我们说话时用到了象征手法。威妮弗雷德并非真的在乎钱。她不在乎他挣钱或不挣钱。她只知道她要靠她父亲给她和孩子们提供四分之三的花费，她把那当作她向埃格伯特宣战的借口。","And Winifred did not really want him to go out into the world to work for money.Money became, alas, a word like a firebrand between them, setting them both aflame with anger.But that is because we must talk in symbols.Winifred did not really care about money.She did not care whether he earned or did not earn anything.Only she knew she was dependent on her father for three-fourths of the money spent for herself and her children, that she let that be the @casus belli@, the drawn weapon between herself and Egbert."
"她想要什么——她究竟想要什么？她母亲曾带着明显讥讽的口吻对她说：“唉，亲爱的，如果你命中注定要面对的人像百合花那样既不劳作、也不纺线，那也不过是万千命运中的一种，或许还不是最不好受的那种呢。为什么你要见怪呢，我的孩子？”","What did she want—what did she want?Her mother once said to her, with that characteristic touch of irony: ‘Well, dear, if it is your fate to consider the lilies, that toil not, neither do they spin, that is one destiny among many others, and perhaps not so unpleasant as most.Why do you take it amiss, my child?’"
"母亲的心思比孩子们更细致入微，所以孩子们很少知道该怎么回答她。于是威妮弗雷德只是更困惑了。问题和百合花无关。至少，就算问题和百合花有关的话，那她的孩子们才是那小小的花朵。他们至少在长起来。耶稣不是说“你想野地里的百合花，怎 么长起来”吗？还好，她的孩子们正在长起来。而孩子父亲身为那朵高大、帅气的花，已经完全盛开了，所以她不想把生命花来照顾处在花样年华的他上。","The mother was subtler than her children, they very rarely knew how to answer her.So Winifred was only more confused.It was not a question of lilies.At least, if it were a question of lilies, then her children were the little blossoms.They at least grew.Doesn’t Jesus say: ‘Consider the lilies how they grow.’Good then, she had her growing babies.But as for that other tall, handsome flower of a father of theirs, he was full grown already, so she did not want to spend her life considering him in the flower of his days."
"不，这不是因为他不挣钱。这不是因为他无所事事。他并不是无所事事。他总是在做事，总是在克罗坎不停地干活，干零碎活。但是，噢，天啊，零碎活——花园小径——绚烂的花朵——待修的椅子，待修的旧椅子！","No, it was not that he didn’t earn money.It was not that he was idle.He was not idle.He was always doing something, always working away, down at Crockham, doing little jobs.But, oh dear, the little jobs—the garden paths—the gorgeous flowers—the chairs to mend, old chairs to mend!"
"他就是这样的毫无主张。只要他干点像样的事情，哪怕是失败了，扔了他们的钱也行！哪怕他和什么事情抗争过那么一下子。不但如此，哪怕他是一个坏人、一个浪子，她也会比现在更自在。那样，她至少能有点东西可以抗拒下。浪子还有立场呢，真的。他会说：“不，我不会通过这种追求增长和相互抱团的行当来帮助和支持社会。我会尽我所能，一点点地掀翻社会这辆苹果车。”或者他会说：“不，我不会操心别人的事。就算我有贪欲，那也是我自己的。相比别人的美德，我更喜欢自己的贪欲。”所以，一个浪子、一个流氓，也有某种立场。他会直面反对和最后的苛责：至少在故事书中是这样。","It was that he stood for nothing.If he had done something unsuccessfully, and lost what money they had!If he had but striven with something.Nay, even if he had been wicked, a waster, she would have been more free.She would have had something to resist, at least.A waster stands for something, really.He says: ‘No, I will not aid and abet society in this business of increase and hanging together, I will upset the apple-cart as much as I can, in my small way.’Or else he says: ‘No, I will not bother about others.If I have lusts, they are my own, and I prefer them to other people’s virtues.’So, a waster, a scamp, takes a sort of stand.He exposes himself to opposition and final castigation: at any rate in story-books."
"但埃格伯特！你能对埃格伯特那样的男人怎样？他没有恶习。他真的很善良，而且很慷慨。他也不虚弱。如果他虚弱的话，威妮弗雷德也许会对他好点。但是他甚至连那种慰藉也没有给她。他不虚弱，也不想要她的安慰或者善意。不用，谢谢。他性情有些急躁，而且比她还倔强，这很罕见。他知道这一点，她也知道。所以她只是更加为难，更加生气了，真是个可怜的人。他比她更高等、更优雅，至于身体，不言而喻，也比她更强壮。他玩弄着他的花园、古老的民歌和莫里斯舞，只管玩弄，而让她用自己的心去支撑起未来的栋梁。","But Egbert!What are you to do with a man like Egbert?He had no vices.He was really kind, nay generous.And he was not weak.If he had been weak Winifred could have been kind to him.But he did not even give her that consolation.He was not weak, and he did not want her consolation or her kindness.No, thank you.He was of a fine passionate temper, and of a rarer steel than she.He knew it, and she knew it.Hence she was only the more baffled and maddened, poor thing.He, the higher, the finer, in his way the stronger, played with his garden, and his old folk-songs and Morris-dances, just played, and let her support the pillars of the future on her own heart."
"他开始变得苦闷，一种邪恶的表情开始浮现在他脸上。他没有向她屈服；他不会那样做。在他那修长、苗条、白皙的身体里，住着七个魔鬼。他很健康，过着自制的生活。是的，他甚至主动要把自己鲜活的生命力锁在体内，现在她无法从他身上拿走它了。或者说，现在她只能偶尔拿走它。因为有时她不得不让步。她如此爱他，如此渴望得到他。他对她来说是如此精致。他是个优雅的生物，比她自己更优雅。是的，她呻吟着不得不屈服于自己对他无法熄灭的欲望。然后他又来到她身上——啊，好可怕，啊，好美妙。有时她会想：他俩怎么可能从席卷两人的极度激情中活下来。这对她来说就像真正的闪电，一道又一道，穿透她身体的每根神经，直至熄灭。","And he began to get bitter, and a wicked look began to come on his face.He did not give in to her; not he.There were seven devils inside his long, slim, white body.He was healthy, full of restrained life.Yes, even he himself had to lock up his own vivid life inside himself, now she would not take it from him.Or rather, now that she only took it occasionally.For she had to yield at times.She loved him so, she desired him so, he was so exquisite to her, the fine creature that he was, finer than herself.Yes, with a groan she had to give in to her own unquenched passion for him.And he came to her then—ah, terrible, ah, wonderful, sometimes she wondered how either of them could live after the terror of the passion that swept between them.It was to her as if pure lightning, flash after flash, went through every fibre of her, till extinction came."
"但是，这就是人生，这就是命运。这就好比云的命运，开始时只是一些蒸汽在缓缓聚集，缓缓地聚集，渐渐充满天空、遮蔽整个太阳。","But it is the fate of human beings to live on.And it is the fate of clouds that seem nothing but bits of vapour slowly to pile up, to pile up and fill the heavens and blacken the sun entirely."
"就是这样的。爱回来了，激情的闪电在他们之间猛烈地划过。于是出现了片刻的蓝天和灿烂。接着，仿佛是不可避免地，不可避免地，云又开始缓缓地从地平线上升起，缓缓地，缓缓地在天空聚拢，不时投下一片冰冷、可恶的阴影：缓缓地，缓缓地聚集，充满了整个苍穹。","So it was.The love came back, the lightning of passion flashed tremendously between them.And there was blue sky and gorgeousness for a little while.And then, as inevitably, as inevitably, slowly the clouds began to edge up again above the horizon, slowly, slowly to lurk about the heavens, throwing an occasional cold and hateful shadow: slowly, slowly to congregate, to fill the empyrean space."
"随着时间一年年过去，闪电点亮天空的次数越来越少，天空中的蓝色也越来越少见。渐渐地灰色的盖子罩住了他们，好像以后会永远如此。","And as the years passed, the lightning cleared the sky more and more rarely, less and less the blue showed.Gradually the grey lid sank down upon them, as if it would be permanent."
"那么，为什么埃格伯特不做点什么呢？为什么他不去掌控生活呢？为什么他不像威妮弗雷德的父亲那样，成为社会的栋梁，哪怕是一根纤细、精致的立柱呢？为什么他不去做点工作呢？为什么他不选择哪怕一个方向呢？","Why didn’t Egbert do something, then?Why didn’t he come to grips with life?Why wasn’t he like Winifred’s father, a pillar of society, even if a slender, exquisite column?Why didn’t he go into harness of some sort?Why didn’t he take some direction?"
"唉，你可以把一头驴带到水边，但是你无法强迫它喝水。世界就是那水，而埃格伯特就是那头驴。他一点都不喝。他做不到：他就是做不到。既然生活窘迫没有迫使他为养家糊口而工作，他当然也不会为了工作而工作。你不能让耧斗菜在一月份花枝招展，也不能让布谷鸟在圣诞节的英格兰放声高歌。为什么？那不是他的季节。他不想那样做。而且，他不可能想那样做。","Well, you can bring an ass to the water, but you cannot make him drink.The world was the water and Egbert was the ass.And he wasn’t having any.He couldn’t: he just couldn’t.Since necessity did not force him to work for his bread and butter, he would not work for work’s sake.You can’t make the columbine flowers nod in January, nor make the cuckoo sing in England at Christmas.Why?It isn’t his season.He doesn’t want to.Nay, he can’t want to."
"埃格伯特的情况就是那样。他无法把自己与世俗事务联系起来，因为他连基本的欲望也没有。不但如此，在他心底有一个更为强烈的欲望：超然物外。超然物外。不伤害任何人。只是超然物外。这不是他的季节。","And there it was with Egbert.He couldn’t link up with the world’s work, because the basic desire was absent from him.Nay, at the bottom of him he had an even stronger desire: to hold aloof.To hold aloof.To do nobody any damage.But to hold aloof.It was not his season."
"也许他本来就不应该结婚生子的。但是你无法阻止水的流动。","Perhaps he should not have married and had children.But you can’t stop the waters flowing."
"对威妮弗雷德来说，也是如此。她生来就受不了这种超然。她的家族谱系是一株茁壮的植物，它必须得随风摇曳，必须得信念坚定。她的生活必须朝一个方向走，或朝另一个方向走。在她自己家里，她完全不了解自己在埃格伯特身上发现的懦怯，她对此无法理解，这使她非常沮丧。面对这种可怕的懦怯，她该做什么，她该做什么？","Which held true for Winifred, too.She was not made to endure aloof.Her family tree was a robust vegetation that had to be stirring and believing.In one direction or another her life had to go.In her own home she had known nothing of this diffidence which she found in Egbert, and which she could not understand, and which threw her into such dismay.What was she to do, what was she to do, in face of this terrible diffidence?"
"在她自己家里，一切都不一样。她父亲或许也有过他自己的担忧，但是他把它们都留在心里。大概他并不太相信我们的这个世界，这个我们费尽心机打造，最终却发现我们自己因心机费尽而死的社会。但是戈弗雷•马歇尔性情坚韧而强硬，也不乏有益的、狡黠的品质。对他来说，这是个如何努力奋斗的问题，其他都留给上天定夺。即使他没有看到什么可以感到荣耀的幻象，他还是真的相信上天。他的信仰方式很盲目，从不怀疑。他的信仰就像一种永远不会灭绝的树流出的树汁那样粗野。他的信仰就是这么的盲目而粗野，和树汁一样盲目而粗野，却有助于人的成长和信仰的维持。也许他有些不择手段，但是同样，一棵正在努力向上生长的树也是不择手段的，它要在长满其他树的密林里挤出一条生路。","It was all so different in her own home.Her father may have had his own misgivings, but he kept them to himself.Perhaps he had no very profound belief in this world of ours, this society which we have elaborated with so much effort, only to find ourselves elaborated to death at last.But Godfrey Marshall was of tough, rough fibre, not without a vein of healthy cunning through it all.It was for him a question of winning through, and leaving the rest to heaven.Without having many illusions to grace him, he still did believe in heaven.In a dark and unquestioning way, he had a sort of faith: an acrid faith like the sap of some not-to-be-exterminated tree.Just a blind acrid faith as sap is blind and acrid, and yet pushes on in growth and in faith.Perhaps he was unscrupulous, but only as a striving tree is unscrupulous, pushing its single way in a jungle of others."
"最后，就是这种粗野的、树汁一样的信仰在推动人类不断前进。人类在亲手为自己建立的社会制度的庇护下，会一代又一代地生活下去，就像在一个用墙围住的花园里那样，即使人类突然灭绝，梨树和葡萄丛仍会一季接一季继续结果。但是一点一点地，墙内的果树会逐渐拖垮支撑它们的墙。一点一点地，每种制度都会崩溃，除非活着的人不停地将它重建或修复。","In the end, it is only this robust, sap-like faith which keeps man going.He may live on for many generations inside the shelter of the social establishment which he has erected for himself, as pear-trees and currant bushes would go on bearing fruit for many seasons, inside a walled garden, even if the race of man were suddenly exterminated.But bit by bit the wall-fruit-trees would gradually pull down the very walls that sustained them.Bit by bit every establishment collapses, unless it is renewed or restored by living hands, all the while."
"埃格伯特根本无法让他自己去做这种重建或修复的事情。他没有意识到这一事实：但是不管怎么说，意识到也不会有多大帮助。他就是不能。他继承了他古老、优雅的血统中的禁欲和享乐的品性。然而，他的岳父尽管比埃格伯特傻多了，却认识到：既然我们来到世上，我们就要活下去。所以他投身到他那一小部分社会工作中去，为他的家庭尽最大的努力，其余的就看上天的最高意志了。某种强健的血液使他能够一直走下去。但是有时，连他身上都会突然迸发出一种对世界和世上万物的怨恨。然而——他自己想要成功，这让他坚持了下去。他拒绝问自己成功意味着什么。它意味着汉普郡的房产，他的孩子们什么都不缺，以及他自己在这个世界上的某种重要性：够了！——够了！够了！","Egbert could not bring himself to any more of this restoring or renewing business.He was not aware of the fact: but awareness doesn’t help much, anyhow.He just couldn’t.He had the stoic and epicurean quality of his old, fine breeding.His father-in-law, however, though he was not one bit more of a fool than Egbert, realized that since we are here we may as well live.And so he applied himself to his own tiny section of the social work, and to doing the best for his family, and to leaving the rest to the ultimate will of heaven.A certain robustness of blood made him able to go on.But sometimes even from him spurted a sudden gall of bitterness against the world and its make-up.And yet—he had his own will-to-succeed, and this carried him through.He refused to ask himself what the success would amount to.It amounted to the estate down in Hampshire, and his children lacking for nothing, and himself of some importance in the world: and @basta!—Basta! Basta!@"
"尽管如此，我们不要把他想象成一个平常的奋斗者。他不是。他跟埃格伯特一样知道梦碎意味着什么。也许在他灵魂里，他有着同样的对成功的评价。但是他有某种粗野的勇气，和某种权力欲望。在他自己的小圈子里，他会动用权力——他盲目的自我所拥有的唯一的力量。尽管他总是溺爱他的孩子们，他仍是传统的英格兰父亲。他很明智，没有制定规矩，没有把权力抽象化。但是他很荣幸地彻底支配了孩子的灵魂，维持了传统父权的威望，这非常不可思议。这把象征父亲神权的旧火炬仍在燃烧，在他内心熊熊燃烧。","Nevertheless do not let us imagine that he was a common pusher.He was not.He knew as well as Egbert what disillusion meant.Perhaps in his soul he had the same estimation of success.But he had a certain acrid courage, and a certain will-to-power.In his own small circle he would emanate power, the single power of his own blind self.With all his spoiling of his children, he was still the father of the old English type.He was too wise to make laws and to domineer in the abstract.But he had kept, and all honour to him, a certain primitive dominion over the souls of his children, the old, almost magic prestige of paternity.There it was, still burning in him, the old smoky torch or paternal godhead."
"他的孩子在这把火炬的圣光照耀下成长起来。最后，他给了女儿们所有的自由。但是他从来没真正让她们走出过他的势力范围。而她们，大胆地走进了我们这个没有父亲的世界，在强烈的白光下，学会了用世界的眼光来看问题。她们学会了批评父亲，甚至把世俗的白光当做真理，并由此出发，把父亲看成下等人。但这也只能在大脑中想想。一旦她们忘了她们那批评的把戏，就会再次被他的权威惯有的红光所笼罩。他的光辉是无法遮蔽的。","And in the sacred glare of this torch his children had been brought up.He had given the girls every liberty, at last.But he had never really let them go beyond his power.And they, venturing out into the hard white light of our fatherless world, learned to see with the eyes of the world.They learned to criticize their father, even, from some effulgence of worldly white light, to see him as inferior.But this was all very well in the head.The moment they forgot their tricks of criticism, the old red glow of his authority came over them again.He was not to be quenched."
"让那些精神分析学家去谈什么恋父情结吧。它不过是一个杜撰的词。这个男人让父权的红色火焰从过去一直燃烧到今天。这种父权甚至可以让他像亚伯拉罕一样将孩子用来祭祀上帝。这种父权决定了孩子们的生死：一种巨大的自然力量。无论孩子们愿意与否，戈弗雷·马歇尔都将守护他们，一直到他的女儿们能够置身于其他巨大的权威之下，直到他的儿子们长大成人，自身也成了同样的权力中心，并延续起同样的男性奥秘。","Let the psycho-analyst talk about father complex.It is just a word invented.Here was a man who had kept alive the old red flame of fatherhood, fatherhood that had even the right to sacrifice the child to God, like Isaac.Fatherhood that had life-and-death authority over the children: a great natural power.And till his children could be brought under some other great authority as girls; or could arrive at manhood and become themselves centres of the same power, continuing the same male mystery as men; until such time, willy-nilly, Godfrey Marshall would keep his children."
"曾经有一阵子，他好像会失去威妮弗雷德。威妮弗雷德崇拜她的丈夫，把他尊为奇妙的事物。大概她期待着能在他身上发现另一个巨大的权威，比她父亲的更大、更好的男性权威。由于体验过男性权威的光芒，她不会很轻易地就转到女性独立的冰冷白光中去。她会渴求，终生渴求真正男性力量的温暖和庇护。","It had seemed as if he might lose Winifred.Winifred had adored her husband, and looked up to him as to something wonderful.Perhaps she had expected in him another great authority, a male authority greater, finer than her father’s.For having once known the glow of male power, she would not easily turn to the cold white light of feminine independence.She would hunger, hunger all her life for the warmth and shelter of true male strength."
"她自然会渴求，因为埃格伯特的力量体现在对权力的放弃上。他自己就是对权力活生生的否定。甚至是对责任的否定。因为对权力的否定最终意味着对责任的否定。随着这些事情的发展，他会把自己禁锢起来。他甚至会试着把他的影响力限制在他自己身上。只要可能，他就试图不去承担对孩子应尽的责任，以避免影响他们。《圣经》上不是说“小孩子要牵引它们”吗？那么，他的小孩子也要牵引自己的命运。他会试着不给小孩的成长方式带来任何的影响。他会避免影响它。自由！","And hunger she might, for Egbert’s power lay in the abnegation of power.He was himself the living negative of power.Even of responsibility.For the negation of power at last means the negation of responsibility.As far as these things went, he would confine himself to himself.He would try to confine his own influence even to himself.He would try, as far as possible, to abstain from influencing his children by assuming any responsibility for them.‘A little child shall lead them—’ His child should lead, then.He would try not to make it go in any direction whatever.He would abstain from influencing it.Liberty!—"
"可怜的威妮弗雷德在这种自由中就像一条离开了水的鱼，渴望着能更紧密地包纳她的元素。直到她孩子的到来。然后她知道她必须为它负责，她必须对它有权威。","Poor Winifred was like a fish out of water in this liberty, gasping for the denser element which should contain her.Till her child came.And then she knew that she must be responsible for it, that she must have authority over it."
"但是埃格伯特不声不响，悄然地从这里插了进来。他不声不响，悄然却致命地弱化了她对她孩子们的权威。","But here Egbert silently and negatively stepped in.Silently, negatively, but fatally he neutralized her authority over her children."
"第三个小女孩出生了。在这之后，威妮弗雷德不想再要小孩了。她的灵魂正在变成荒野。","There was a third little girl born.And after this Winifred wanted no more children.Her soul was turning to salt."
"所以她看管孩子们，她们是她的责任。她们花的钱来自她的父亲。她会为她们尽最大努力，掌控着她们的生死。但是不！埃格伯特不会承担责任。他甚至不会给钱。但是他不会让她任意行事。他不允许她有隐秘、沉默、易怒的权威。这是他们之间的斗争，自由与传统家族权威之间的斗争。当然，他赢了。小女孩们爱他，崇敬她。“爸爸！爸爸！”她们可以跟他一起，做她们喜欢的事。她们的母亲则会管束她们。她本来可以激情满满地管束她们，带着痴迷，带着父母权威的古老而隐秘的魔力，那种时隐时现而不容置疑的权威，毕竟，那也是神授的权威：如果我们相信神授权威的话。作为天主教徒，马歇尔一家是相信的。","So she had charge of the children, they were her responsibility.The money for them had come from her father.She would do her very best for them, and have command over their life and death.But no!Egbert would not take the responsibility.He would not even provide the money.But he would not let her have her way.Her dark, silent, passionate authority he would not allow.It was a battle between them, the battle between liberty and the old blood-power.And of course he won.The little girls loved him and adored him.‘Daddy!Daddy!’They could do as they liked with him.Their mother would have ruled them.She would have ruled them passionately, with indulgence, with the old dark magic of parental authority, something looming and unquestioned and, after all, divine: if we believe in divine authority.The Marshalls did, being Catholic."
"而埃格伯特，把她的古老而隐秘的天主教家族权威变成了一种独裁。他不会把她的孩子们留给她。他把她们从她那里偷走，却不承担对她们的责任。在情感和精神上，他把她们从她那里偷走，只让她控制她们的行为。对于一位母亲来说，这是一件费力却不讨好的事。她的孩子们崇敬他，一直崇敬他，却很少知道她们正在为自己准备着空虚的苦痛，那种当她们也长大成人，有了像埃格伯特那样可爱却无用的丈夫时的苦痛。","And Egbert, he turned her old dark, Catholic blood-authority into a sort of tyranny.He would not leave her her children.He stole them from her, and yet without assuming responsibility for them.He stole them from her, in emotion and spirit, and left her only to command their behaviour.A thankless lot for a mother.And her children adored him, adored him, little knowing the empty bitterness they were preparing for themselves when they too grew up to have husbands: husbands such as Egbert, adorable and null."
"乔伊斯这个年龄最大的孩子，仍是他的最爱。她现在六岁了，是个一刻也不安宁的小家伙。巴巴拉最小的孩子现在两岁，还在蹒跚学步。她们大部分时间都在克罗坎度过，因为他想呆在那儿。就连威妮弗雷德也着实喜欢那个地方。但现在，由于她处于沮丧而盲目的状态，那地方对她的孩子们而言充满了威胁。蝰蛇、有毒的浆果、小溪、沼泽、也许不怎么干净的水——一样接一样。在母亲和保姆眼里，她们必须像游击战中的炮火那样不停地发号施令。而这三个不安生的金发小女孩却不服管束，会欢快地到处跑。支持孩子们与母亲和保姆对着干的是这位父亲。事实的确如此。","Joyce, the eldest, was still his favourite.She was now a quicksilver little thing of six years old.Barbara, the youngest, was a toddler of two years.They spent most of their time down at Crockham, because he wanted to be there.And even Winifred loved the place really.But now, in her frustrated and blinded state, it was full of menace for her children.The adders, the poison-berries, the brook, the marsh, the water that might not be pure—one thing and another.From mother and nurse it was a guerilla gunfire of commands, and blithe, quicksilver disobedience from the three blonde, never-still little girls.Behind the girls was the father, against mother and nurse.And so it was."
"“如果你不快点过来，保姆，我就跑出去，到有蛇的地方去。”","‘If you don’t come quick, nurse, I shall run out there to where there are snakes.’"
"“乔伊斯，你必须耐心等等。我正在给安纳贝尔换衣服。”","‘Joyce, you must be patient.I’m just changing Annabel.’"
"你看吧。情况就是那样：总是那样。他正在小溪那边的公地上干活，也听见了。然而他继续干活，跟以往一样。","There you are.There it was: always the same.Working away on the common across the brook he heard it.And he worked on, just the same."
"忽然，他听到一声尖叫。他扔掉铲子，朝桥上跑去，看上去就像一头受惊的鹿。啊，威妮弗雷德在那里——乔伊斯弄伤了自己。他来到花园。","Suddenly he heard a shriek, and he flung the spade from him and started for the bridge, looking up like a startled deer.Ah, there was Winifred—Joyce had hurt herself.He went on up the garden."
"“怎么回事？”","‘What is it?’"
"孩子还在哭喊——现在喊的是——“爸爸！爸爸！噢——噢，爸爸！”母亲不停地说着：","The child was still screaming—now it was—‘Daddy!Daddy!Oh—oh, Daddy!’And the mother was saying:"
"“别害怕，宝贝。让妈妈看看。”","‘Don’t be frightened, darling.Let mother look.’"
"但孩子只是哭喊：","But the child only cried:"
"“噢，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸！”","‘Oh, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!’"
"看到血从自己的膝盖上冒出来的情景，她吓坏了。威妮弗雷德弯下腰，把这六岁大的孩子放在膝上，仔细检查她的膝盖。埃格伯特也弯下腰。","She was terrified by the sight of the blood running from her own knee.Winifred crouched down, with her child of six in her lap, to examine the knee.Egbert bent over also."
"“别喊了，乔伊斯。”他焦躁地说，“她怎么把自己弄伤的？”","‘Don’t make such a noise, Joyce,’ he said irritably.‘How did she do it?’"
"“你除草后把镰刀什么的到处乱扔，她踩到上面，被绊倒了。”威妮弗雷德说着，一边盯着他弯腰凑过来的脸，眼神中带着严厉的责备。","‘She fell on that sickle thing which you left lying about after cutting the grass,’ said Winifred, looking into his face with bitter accusation as he bent near."
"他取出手帕，把它系在孩子的膝盖上。然后，他双手抱起这个还在抽泣的孩子，走进屋子，来到楼上她的床铺。在他怀里，她变得安静了。而他的内心正受着痛苦和内疚的煎熬。他把镰刀丢在草地边，让他如此深爱的大女儿因此受了伤。但是接着一想，这是一个意外——这是一个意外。他为何要感到内疚呢？很可能什么事都没有，过两三天就会好转。为什么要如此在意，为什么要担心呢？他把这事搁到了一边。","He had taken his handkerchief and tied it round the knee.Then he lifted the still sobbing child in his arms, and carried her into the house and upstairs to her bed.In his arms she became quiet.But his heart was burning with pain and with guilt.He had left the sickle there lying on the edge of the grass, and so his first-born child whom he loved so dearly had come to hurt.But then it was an accident—it was an accident.Why should he feel guilty?It would probably be nothing, better in two or three days.Why take it to heart, why worry?He put it aside."
"孩子穿着她的小夏装，躺在床上。经过这场惊吓，她现在脸色苍白。保姆抱着最小的孩子来了：小安纳贝尔站在那儿，抓着裙子。威妮弗雷德显得极其严肃，跟木头似的，正在俯身看女儿的膝盖。她从膝盖上取下了他那块浸染着鲜血的手帕。埃格伯特也俯身向前，脸上比心里显得更加镇定。威妮弗雷德显得一脸的严肃，他也不得不收敛些。孩子呻吟着，呜咽着。","The child lay on the bed in her little summer frock, her face very white now after the shock, Nurse had come carrying the youngest child: and little Annabel stood holding her skirt.Winifred, terribly serious and wooden-seeming, was bending over the knee, from which she had taken his blood-soaked handkerchief.Egbert bent forward, too, keeping more sangfroid in his face than in his heart.Winifred went all of a lump of seriousness, so he had to keep some reserve.The child moaned and whimpered."
"膝盖仍在大量出血——那是一个很深的伤口，正好在关节处。","The knee was still bleeding profusely—it was a deep cut right in the joint."
"“你最好去找个医生，埃格伯特。”威妮弗雷德心痛地说。","‘You’d better go for the doctor, Egbert,’ said Winifred bitterly."
"“噢，不！噢，不！”乔伊斯惊慌地哭喊着。","‘Oh, no!Oh, no!’ cried Joyce in a panic."
"“乔伊斯，我亲爱的，别哭！”威妮弗雷德说着，突然把小女孩搂到胸前，带着一种怪异的悲痛，宛若“痛苦之母”。连孩子都被吓得不敢出声了。埃格伯特看着妻子把孩子搂在胸前那悲哀的样子，转身走开了。只有安纳贝尔突然间大叫起来：“乔伊斯，乔伊斯，别让你的腿流血了！”","‘Joyce, my darling, don’t cry!’ said Winifred, suddenly catching the little girl to her breast in a strange tragic anguish, the @Mater Dolorata@.Even the child was frightened into silence.Egbert looked at the tragic figure of his wife with the child at her breast, and turned away.Only Annabel started suddenly to cry: ‘Joycey, Joycey, don’t have your leg bleeding!’"
"埃格伯特骑了四英里路，去村里找医生。他禁不住觉得威妮弗雷德有点小题大做了。膝盖本身肯定没怎么伤着！肯定没有。这只是一个皮外伤而已。","Egbert rode four miles to the village for the doctor.He could not help feeling that Winifred was laying it on rather.Surely the knee itself wasn’t hurt!Surely not.It was only a surface cut."
"医生出门了。埃格伯特留了口信，又急速地骑车往家里赶。他的心在遭受着焦虑的煎熬。他扔下自行车，汗流浃背地来到屋子里，看起来似乎矮了一截，像一个犯了错的人。威妮弗雷德在楼上，坐在乔伊斯旁边。乔伊斯在床上，看起来脸色苍白，像个地位尊贵的人，正在吃一些木薯布丁。孩子那苍白、小巧、受惊的脸庞让埃格伯特痛彻心扉。","The doctor was out.Egbert left the message and came cycling swiftly home, his heart pinched with anxiety.He dropped sweating off his bicycle and went into the house, looking rather small, like a man who is at fault.Winifred was upstairs sitting by Joyce, who was looking pale and important in bed, and was eating some tapioca pudding.The pale, small, scared face of his child went to Egbert’s heart."
"“温医生不在家。他两点半左右会来这里。”埃格伯特说。","‘Doctor Wing was out.He’ll be here about half past two,’ said Egbert."
"“我不要他来。”乔伊斯啜泣着。","‘I don’t want him to come,’ whimpered Joyce."
"“乔伊斯，亲爱的，你得耐心点、安静点。”威妮弗雷德说，“他不会伤害你的。相反，他会告诉我们怎么做才能让你的膝盖好得更快些。那就是他为什么必须来的原因。”","‘Joyce, dear, you must be patient and quiet,’ said Winifred.‘He won’t hurt you.But he will tell us what to do to make your knee better quickly.That is why he must come.’"
"威妮弗雷德总是仔细地给她的小女孩们解释，而那总是会让她们暂时找不到说话的机会。","Winifred always explained carefully to her little girls: and it always took the words off their lips for the moment."
"“还在流血吗？”埃格伯特说。","‘Does it bleed yet?’ said Egbert."
"威妮弗雷德小心地把被子掀开。","Winifred moved the bedclothes carefully aside."
"“我想没有了。”她说。","‘I think not,’ she said."
"埃格伯特也俯身去看。","Egbert stooped also to look."
"“是的，没有了。”她说。然后他站直身体，面部表情放松了下来。他转向孩子。","‘No, it doesn’t,’ she said.Then he stood up with a relieved look on his face.He turned to the child."
"“吃你的布丁吧，乔伊斯。”他说，“不会有什么事。你只需要安安静静地呆几天。”","‘Eat your pudding, Joyce,’ he said.‘It won’t be anything.You’ve only got to keep still for a few days.’"
"“你还没吃饭，是吧，爸爸？”","‘You haven’t had your dinner, have you, Daddy?’"
"“还没呢。”","‘Not yet.’"
"“保姆会给你准备好。”威妮弗雷德说。","‘Nurse will give it to you,’ said Winifred."
"“你会没事的，乔伊斯。”他说，对孩子微笑着，把她金色的头发从额上拨开。她也乖巧地对着他的脸微笑。","‘You’ll be all right, Joyce,’ he said, smiling to the child and pushing the blonde hair off her brow.She smiled back winsomely into his face."
"他走下楼，一个人吃着饭。保姆在一边侍候着他。","He went downstairs and ate his meal alone.Nurse served him."
"她喜欢侍候他。所有女人都喜欢他，喜欢为他做事。医生来了——一个肥胖的乡村医生，快乐且友善。","She liked waiting on him.All women liked him and liked to do things for him.The doctor came—a fat country practitioner, pleasant and kind."
"“怎么了，小姑娘，跌倒了，是吗？为你这么一位聪明的小女士做事真是快乐！什么！割伤了膝盖！啧—啧—啧！你可有点不够聪明了，那现在呢？没关系，没关系，很快会好的。我们来看一看伤口。不会伤着你。绝对一点都不会。保姆，拿只碗盛点温水来。很快就又好了，很快就好了。”","‘What, little girl, been tumbling down, have you?There’s a thing to be doing, for a smart little lady like you!What!And cutting your knee!Tut-tut-tut!That wasn’t clever of you, now was it?Never mind, never mind, soon be better.Let us look at it.Won’t hurt you.Not the least in life.Bring a bowl with a little warm water, nurse.Soon have it all right again, soon have it all right.’"
"乔伊斯朝他笑着，苍白的笑容里带着一丝优越感。她还不太习惯别人以这种方式跟她说话。","Joyce smiled at him with a pale smile of faint superiority.This was not the way in which she was used to being talked to."
"医生弯下腰，仔细查看孩子那瘦小、受伤的膝盖。埃格伯特俯身在他上面。","He bent down, carefully looking at the little, thin, wounded knee of the child.Egbert bent over him."
"“噢，天哪，噢，天哪！有点深的小伤口。讨厌的小伤口。讨厌的小伤口。不过，没关系。没关系，小女士。我们很快会让它好起来。很快就让它好起来，小女士。你叫什么名字？”","‘Oh, dear, oh, dear!Quite a deep little cut.Nasty little cut.Nasty little cut.But, never mind.Never mind, little lady.We’ll soon have it better.Soon have it better, little lady.What’s your name?’"
"“我叫乔伊斯。”小孩清楚地说道。","‘My name is Joyce,’ said the child distinctly."
"“哦，是嘛！”他回答说，“哦，是嘛！嗯，我觉得那也是个好名字。乔伊斯，啊？——乔伊斯小姐大概多大了？她会告诉我吗？”","‘Oh, really!’ he replied.‘Oh, really!Well, that’s a fine name too, in my opinion.Joyce, eh?—And how old might Miss Joyce be?Can she tell me that?’"
"“我六岁了。”小孩有点被逗乐了，非常有优越感地说。","‘I’m six,’ said the child, slightly amused and very condescending."
"“六岁！那样啊。你能数到六了，是吧？嗯，那才是个聪明的小姑娘，聪明的小姑娘。我保证，要是她必须要喝一勺药，她都不会嘟囔一声。不像某些小姑娘。如何？啊？”","‘Six!There now.Add up and count as far as six, can you?Well, that’s a clever little girl, a clever little girl.And if she has to drink a spoonful of medicine, she won’t make a murmur, I’ll be bound.Not like some little girls.What? Eh?’"
"“如果妈妈要我喝，我会的。”乔伊斯说。","‘I take it if mother wishes me to,’ said Joyce."
"“啊，那样啊！那才像样！那才是我想从一位因为膝盖受伤而躺在床上的小女士那里听到的话。那才像样——”","‘Ah, there now!That’s the style!That’s what I like to hear from a little lady in bed because she’s cut her knee.That’s the style—’"
"这个让人舒服而又喋喋不休的医生处理好膝盖的伤口，然后打上绷带，并建议让小女士卧床休息，吃清淡的食物。他认为一两个星期后就会痊愈。幸好——没有伤及骨头或韧带。只是割破了皮肉。他一两天后会再来。","The comfortable and prolix doctor dressed and bandaged the knee and recommended bed and a light diet for the little lady.He thought a week or a fortnight would put it right.No bones or ligatures damaged—fortunately.Only a flesh cut.He would come again in a day or two."
"于是，乔伊斯放心地躺在床上，还把她所有的玩具都搬到了楼上。她父亲经常陪她玩。第三天，医生来了。他对膝盖的情况相当满意。它正在愈合。它正在愈合——是的——是的。继续让小孩躺在床上。一两天后他会再来。威妮弗雷德有些许不安。从表面看，伤口似乎在愈合，但小孩感觉太痛了。情况看起来不大对劲。她把这一想法给埃格伯特说了。","So Joyce was reassured and stayed in bed and had all her toys up.Her father often played with her.The doctor came the third day.He was fairly pleased with the knee.It was healing.It was healing—yes—yes.Let the child continue in bed.He came again after a day or two.Winifred was a trifle uneasy.The wound seemed to be healing on the top, but it hurt the child too much.It didn’t look quite right.She said so to Egbert."
"“埃格伯特，我肯定乔伊斯的膝盖没有在彻底地愈合。”","‘Egbert, I’m sure Joyce’s knee isn’t healing properly.’"
"“我认为它在。”他说，“我认为它愈合得很好。”","‘I think it is,’ he said.‘I think it’s all right.’"
"“我想请温医生再来一次——我感到不满意。”","‘I’d rather Doctor Wing came again—I don’t feel satisfied.’"
"“你难道不是在试图把事情想象得比实际更糟吗？”","‘Aren’t you trying to imagine it worse than it really is?’"
"“当然，你可以这样说。但我现在要给温医生写一张明信片。”","‘You would say so, of course.But I shall write a post-card to Doctor Wing now.’"
"医生第二天来了。他检查了膝盖。是的，有炎症。是的，可能有一点脓毒——可能有。可能有。孩子有发烧吗？","The doctor came next day.He examined the knee.Yes, there was inflammation.Yes, there might be a little septic poisoning—there might.There might.Was the child feverish?"
"这样两星期过去了，孩子真发烧了，膝盖的炎症更厉害了，变得更糟，而且很痛，很痛。孩子晚上会哭闹，她母亲不得不整夜陪在她身边。埃格伯特仍然坚持认为这没事，真的——它会过去的。但他内心却很焦急。","So a fortnight passed by, and the child was feverish, and the knee was more inflamed and grew worse and was painful, painful.She cried in the night, and her mother had to sit up with her.Egbert still insisted it was nothing, really—it would pass.But in his heart he was anxious."
"威妮弗雷德又给她父亲写信了。星期六，这位老人来了。一看到这个穿着灰色西服的矮壮身影，威妮弗雷德全身便笼罩在一种巨大的渴望中。","Winifred wrote again to her father.On Saturday the elderly man appeared.And no sooner did Winifred see the thick, rather short figure in its grey suit than a great yearning came over her."
"“父亲，我对乔伊斯的情况不满意。我对温医生不满意。”","‘Father, I’m not satisfied with Joyce.I’m not satisfied with Doctor Wing.’"
"“嗯，威妮，亲爱的，如果你不满意，我们就必须找更好的医生，就是这样。”","‘Well, Winnie, dear, if you’re not satisfied we must have further advice, that is all.’"
"这个结实、有力的老人走上楼，他的声音响彻整个屋子，好像刺穿了屋子里紧张的气氛。","The sturdy, powerful, elderly man went upstairs, his voice sounding rather grating through the house, as if it cut upon the tense atmosphere."
"“你怎么样，乔伊斯，宝贝？”他对孩子说，“膝盖痛吗？你感到痛吗，亲爱的？”","‘How are you, Joyce, darling?’ he said to the child.‘Does your knee hurt you?Does it hurt you, dear?’"
"“有时痛。”孩子有点惧怕他，对他很冷淡。","‘It does sometimes.’The child was shy of him, cold towards him."
"“噢，亲爱的，我很难过。我希望你尽量忍着，不要太麻烦你母亲。”","‘Well, dear, I’m sorry for that.I hope you try to bear it, and not trouble mother too much.’"
"没有回答。他看了看膝盖。膝盖又红又僵。","There was no answer.He looked at the knee.It was red and stiff."
"“当然，”他说，“我认为我们必须另找一位医生咨询一下。”如果我们打算这么做，最好马上就做。埃格伯特，你可否骑车到宾厄姆去请韦恩医生来？我发现他在治疗威妮的母亲时很让人满意。","‘Of course,’ he said, ‘I think we must have another doctor’s opinion.And if we’re going to have it, we had better have it at once.Egbert, do you think you might cycle in to Bingham for Doctor Wayne?I found him very satisfactory for Winnie’s mother.’"
"“如果您认为有必要的话，我可以去。”埃格伯特说。","‘I can go if you think it necessary,’ said Egbert."
"“我当然认为有必要。即使没什么事，那我们也可以心安。我当然认为有必要。可能的话，我希望韦恩医生今天晚上就来。”","‘Certainly I think it necessary.Even if there if nothing, we can have peace of mind.Certainly I think it necessary.I should like Doctor Wayne to come this evening if possible.’"
"于是，埃格伯特骑着自行车迎风出发了，就像一个替人跑腿的男孩，留下他岳父去当威妮弗雷德的精神支柱。","So Egbert set off on his bicycle through the wind, like a boy sent on an errand, leaving his father-in-law a pillar of assurance, with Winifred."
"韦恩医生来了，看起来很严肃。是的，膝盖的确在向不好的方向发展。孩子可能终生腿瘸。","Doctor Wayne came, and looked grave.Yes, the knee was certainly taking the wrong way.The child might be lame for life."
"激动、恐惧和愤怒开始在每个人心中燃起。第二天，韦恩医生又来进行了一次正规的检查。是的，膝盖的确已经向坏的方向发展。应该对它进行X光检查。这非常重要。","Up went the fire and fear and anger in every heart.Doctor Wayne came again the next day for a proper examination.And, yes, the knee had really taken bad ways.It should be X-rayed.It was very important."
"戈弗雷•马歇尔和医生在小径上走过来走过去，旁边停着一辆汽车。他们走过来又走过去，进行着商谈。他一生中经历过好多次这样的商谈。","Godfrey Marshall walked up and down the lane with the doctor, beside the standing motor-car: up and down, up and down in one of those consultations of which he had had so many in his life."
"最后，他走进屋里，来到威妮弗雷德面前。","As a result he came indoors to Winifred."
"“嗯，威妮，亲爱的，最好的办法是把乔伊斯带到伦敦去，她会在那里的一个私人疗养院得到正规的治疗。当然，这个膝盖已经由于治疗不佳而恶化了。而且显而易见的是，孩子甚至很可能会失去她的这条腿。你怎么想的，亲爱的？你同意我们把她带到城里，让她得到最好的照料吗？”","‘Well, Winnie, dear, the best thing to do is to take Joyce up to London, to a nursing home where she can have proper treatment.Of course this knee has been allowed to go wrong.And apparently there is a risk that the child may even lose her leg.What do you think, dear?You agree to our taking her up to town and putting her under the best care?’"
"“哦，父亲，你知道我愿意为她做任何事情。”","‘Oh, father, you know I would do anything on earth for her.’"
"“我知道你会，威妮宝贝。遗憾的是已经造成了这不幸的延误。我无法想象温医生都做了些什么。很明显，孩子有失去一条腿的危险。那好，如果你把一切都收拾妥当，明天我们就带她去城里。我将预订丹利疗养院的大救护车，让它十点钟到这里来。埃格伯特，你可以马上去给杰克逊医生发封电报吗？这是一家小型私人疗养院，专门针对小孩和外科病例，离贝克大街不远。我相信乔伊斯会在那里康复的。”","‘I know you would, Winnie darling.The pity is that there has been this unfortunate delay already.I can’t think what Doctor Wing was doing.Apparently the child is in danger of losing her leg.Well then, if you will have everything ready, we will take her up to town tomorrow.I will order the large car from Denley’s to be here at ten.Egbert, will you take a telegram at once to Doctor Jackson?It is a small nursing home for children and for surgical cases, not far from Baker Street.I’m sure Joyce will be all right there.’"
"“噢，父亲，我不能亲自护理她么！”","‘Oh, father, can’t I nurse her myself!’"
"“嗳，宝贝，如果要得到正规的治疗，她最好呆在疗养院里。应该接受X光治疗、电疗，等等需要的治疗。”","‘Well, darling, if she is to have proper treatment, she had best be in a home.The X-ray treatment, and the electric treatment, and whatever is necessary.’"
"“这样会花上一大笔的——”威妮弗雷德说。","‘It will cost a great deal—’ said Winifred."
"“如果孩子的腿——甚至她的生命都有了危险，我们就不能考虑费用问题了。谈费用没用。”老人很不耐烦地说。","‘We can’t think of cost, if the child’s leg is in danger—or even her life.No use speaking of cost,’ said the elder man impatiently."
"事情就这样定了。可怜的乔伊斯，四肢伸展地躺在密闭的大汽车的床上——母亲坐在她头这一边；蓄着短灰胡子、戴着常礼帽的外公坐在她脚这一边，他深感责任在身，心情久久难以平复——他们慢慢地驶离克罗坎，也把埃格伯特留在了身后。他站在那里，光着头，有点被羞辱的感觉。他要去关好房屋，然后第二天带着家里其他人乘火车去城里。","And so it was.Poor Joyce, stretched out on a bed in the big closed motor-car—the mother sitting by her head, the grandfather in his short grey beard and a bowler hat, sitting by her feet, thick, and implacable in his responsibility—they rolled slowly away from Crockham, and from Egbert who stood there bareheaded and a little ignominious, left behind.He was to shut up the house and bring the rest of the family back to town, by train, the next day."
"接下来是一段黑暗而痛苦的日子。这可怜的孩子。这个可怜的、可怜的孩子，在那家疗养院里，受了怎样的痛苦，受了多么久的折磨啊。正是这痛苦的六个星期，永远地改变了威妮弗雷德的灵魂。她坐在床边，看着这个可怜的、饱受折磨的小孩。孩子不仅被膝盖的病痛折磨，更惨的是被这些可怕、但也许必要的现代治疗手段折磨。此时，她感到她的心死了，正在胸中变凉。她的小乔伊斯，她的脆弱、勇敢、美好的小乔伊斯，瘦弱、娇小而又苍白，犹如一朵白色的花！啊，她，威妮弗雷德，怎么敢这么恶毒，这么恶毒，这么不小心，这么纵欲。","Followed a dark and bitter time.The poor child.The poor, poor child, how she suffered, an agony and a long crucifixion in that nursing home.It was a bitter six weeks which changed the soul of Winifred for ever.As she sat by the bed of her poor, tortured little child, tortured with the agony of the knee, and the still worse agony of these diabolic, but perhaps necessary modern treatments, she felt her heart killed and going cold in her breast.Her little Joyce, her frail, brave, wonderful, little Joyce, frail and small and pale as a white flower!Ah, how had she, Winifred, dared to be so wicked, so wicked, so careless, so sensual."
"“让我的心死去吧！让我女人的凡心死去吧！救世主，让我的心死去吧。救救我的孩子。让我的心死去吧，离开这个世界和这个肉体。噢，摧毁我如此任意妄为的心吧。让我高傲的心死去吧。让我的心死去吧。”","‘Let my heart die!Let my woman’s heart of flesh die!Saviour, let my heart die.And save my child.Let my heart die from the world and from the flesh.Oh, destroy my heart that is so wayward.Let my heart of pride die.Let my heart die.’"
"她在孩子的床边这样祈祷着。就像圣母胸前被插上了七把剑，她的高傲和激情之心在她胸中慢慢死去，不停地流着血。它流着血慢慢地死去。为了寻求安慰，她转向教会，转向耶稣，转向圣母，但最主要的是转向那个伟大而不朽的机构，罗马天主教。她退缩到教会的庇护之下。她是一位三个孩子的母亲。但她的灵魂死了，她的高傲、激情和欲望之心已流血而死。她的灵魂属于她的教会，她的身体属于她作为一个母亲的责任。","So she prayed beside the bed of her child.And like the Mother with the seven swords in her breast, slowly her heart of pride and passion died in her breast, bleeding away.Slowly it died, bleeding away, and she turned to the Church for comfort, to Jesus, to the Mother of God, but most of all, to that great and enduring institution, the Roman Catholic Church.She withdrew into the shadow of the Church.She was a mother with three children.But in her soul she died, her heart of pride and passion and desire bled to death, her soul belonged to her church, her body belonged to her duty as a mother."
"她作为一个妻子的责任不在其中。作为一个妻子，她没有责任感，只有对这个男人的某种愤恨。她已经跟这个男人一起，体会了那种肉体的快感和愉悦。她简直就是“痛苦之母”。对这个男人，她像坟墓一样关闭了。","Her duty as a wife did not enter.As a wife she had no sense of duty: only a certain bitterness towards the man with whom she had known such sensuality and distraction.She was purely the @Mater Dolorata@.To the man she was closed as a tomb."
"埃格伯特过来看孩子。但威妮弗雷德似乎总是坐在那里，像是他男权和父权的坟墓。可怜的威妮弗雷德：她仍然年轻，仍然壮实、红润、漂亮，像田野里鲜艳、顽强的花朵一样。奇怪——她那红润、健康的脸庞，如此忧郁；她的壮实、充满活力的身体，如此平静。她简直是一个修女！但她永远不会那样。然而随着一声缓慢、响亮的铿锵声，她的灵魂之门已经在他面前关上了，永远地把他关在了门外。她没有必要去女修道院。她的意志已经做到了这一点。","Egbert came to see his child.But Winifred seemed to be always seated there, like the tomb of his manhood and his fatherhood.Poor Winifred: she was still young, still strong and ruddy and beautiful like a ruddy hard flower of the field.Strange—her ruddy, healthy face, so sombre, and her strong, heavy, full-blooded body, so still.She, a nun!Never.And yet the gates of her heart and soul had shut in his face with a slow, resonant clang, shutting him out for ever.There was no need for her to go into a convent.Her will had done it."
"在这年轻的母亲和年轻的父亲之间，躺着这个瘸腿的孩子，像枕头上的一团浅色的丝绵，映出一张苍白的、饱受病痛折磨的小脸。他无法忍受这情景。他真的无法忍受这情景。他转过身去。他无能为力，只能转过身去。他转过身去，漫无目的地四处走动。他仍然有魅力、讨人喜欢。只是他眉间有了一道皱纹，似乎那里被一把小斧头砍了一刀：刚好砍了进去，在那里留下了永久的印记。","And between this young mother and this young father lay the crippled child, like a bit of pale silk floss on the pillow, and a little white pain-quenched face.He could not bear it.He just could not bear it.He turned aside.There was nothing to do but to turn aside.He turned aside, and went hither and thither, desultory.He was still attractive and desirable.But there was a little frown between his brow as if he had been cleft there with a hatchet: cleft right in, for ever, and that was the stigma."
"孩子的腿保住了，但膝盖被牢牢地固定起来了。目前的担心是小腿会不会萎缩，或者停止生长。必须对它进行长期的按摩和治疗，每天都要治疗，即使孩子不在疗养院时也要这样做。全部费用都是由这位外公承担的。","The child’s leg was saved: but the knee was locked stiff.The fear now was lest the lower leg should wither, or cease to grow.There must be long-continued massage and treatment, daily treatment, even when the child left the nursing home.And the whole of the expense was borne by the grandfather."
"现在，埃格伯特没有真正的家了。威妮弗雷德跟孩子和保姆一起，长期住在伦敦的小公寓里。他不能住那里：他会克制不了自己。小木屋关起来了——或是借给了朋友。他有时去他的花园干活，使那地方保持井然有序。然后，晚上，四周房子都空荡荡的，房间全都空荡荡的，他感到他的心变坏了。挫败感和无能感，像一条缓慢、迟钝的蛇，正慢慢地咬穿他的心。无能、无能：沼泽地般可怕的毒液流过他的血管，把他杀死。","Egbert now had no real home.Winifred with the children and nurse was tied to the little flat in London.He could not live there: he could not contain himself.The cottage was shut-up—or lent to friends.He went down sometimes to work in his garden and keep the place in order.Then with the empty house around him at night, all the empty rooms, he felt his heart go wicked.The sense of frustration and futility, like some slow, torpid snake, slowly bit right through his heart.Futility, futility: the horrible marsh-poison went through his veins and killed him."
"在寂静的白天，当他在花园里干活时，他会试图去听声音。没有声音。没有威妮弗雷德从黑暗的小屋里传来的声音，没有孩子们从空气中、从公地上、从近处传来的说话声。没有一点声音，除了古老而黑暗的沼泽地散发出的毒气以外，什么都没有。于是，他白天断断续续地干些活，到了晚上，就生一堆火，然后一个人做些吃的。","As he worked in the garden in the silence of day he would listen for a sound.No sound.No sound of Winifred from the dark inside of the cottage: no sound of children’s voices from the air, from the common, from the near distance.No sound, nothing but the old dark marsh-venomous atmosphere of the place.So he worked spasmodically through the day, and at night made a fire and cooked some food alone."
"他独自一人。他自己打扫小屋，整理床铺。但针线活他是不做的。当他干活时，他衬衫的肩膀处裂口了，露出了里面白皙的皮肤。他会感觉到空气和雨点打在他裸露的皮肉上。他会再次眺望整块公地。那里，一簇簇黑压压的荆豆正在枯萎、结籽，而一丛丛石南花正在变成粉红色，像零星的祭血。","He was alone.He himself cleaned the cottage and made his bed.But his mending he did not do.His shirts were slit on the shoulders, when he had been working, and the white flesh showed through.He would feel the air and the spots of rain on his exposed flesh.And he would look again across the common, where the dark, tufted gorse was dying to seed, and the bits of cat-heather were coming pink in tufts, like a sprinkling of sacrificial blood."
"他回想起这地方那蛮荒而古老的精神：对古老众神和那些早已逝去的激情的渴望——对嘶嘶作响着从他面前闪过的冷血的蛇的激情，神秘的血祭，所有那些属于这里的原始居民、却早已丧失的炙热激情——这些激情在罗马人到来之前很久便开始在空气中萦绕，一直流传至今。空气中萦绕着一种逝去的、隐秘的激情。还有那躲在暗处的蛇。","His heart went back to the savage old spirit of the place: the desire for old gods, old, lost passions, the passion of the cold-blooded, darting snakes that hissed and shot away from him, the mystery of blood-sacrifices, all the lost, intense sensations of the primeval people of the place, whose passions seethed in the air still, from those long days before the Romans came.The seethe of a lost, dark passion in the air.The presence of unseen snakes."
"他的脸上出现了一种怪异、困惑、半是邪恶的表情。他不会在小屋里呆太长时间。突然，他会觉得必须要蹬上他的自行车，去——随便什么地方。随便什么地方，离开这里就好。他会在原来的家里和母亲呆上几天。他母亲非常爱他，像任何母亲一样为他难过。但是那困惑、半是邪恶的微笑浮现在他脸上，他就突然转意，离开了母亲的牵挂，跟离开一切别的事物一样。","A queer, baffled, half-wicked look came on his face.He could not stay long at the cottage.Suddenly he must swing on to his bicycle and go—anywhere.Anywhere, away from the place.He would stay a few days with his mother in the old home.His mother adored him and grieved as a mother would.But the little, baffled, half-wicked smile curled on his face, and he swung away from his mother’s solicitude as from everything else."
"他总是在走动——从一个地方到另一个地方，从一个朋友到另一个朋友，总是转离别人的同情。只要同情像一只温柔的手那般伸出来要触碰他，他就会马上转向离开，像一条无毒蛇一样从突然转向、转向、转向，离开一只伸出的手。他必须离开。他会定期回到威妮弗雷德身边。","Always moving on—from place to place, friend to friend: and always swinging away from sympathy.As soon as sympathy, like a soft hand, was reached out to touch him, away he swerved, instinctively, as a harmless snake swerves and swerves and swerves away from an outstretched hand.Away he must go.And periodically he went back to Winifred."
"现在，对她来说，他很可怕，像一种诱惑。她全身心都扑在孩子和教会上。乔伊斯又可以站起来了；但是，哎！她瘸了，腿靠有铁支架撑着，还拄着一根小拐杖。奇怪的是她怎么长成了一个身材高挑、面色暗淡、个性野蛮的小家伙。很奇怪，疼痛没有让她变得温柔、听话，反而使这孩子养成了一种狂野、近乎暴怒的脾气。她七岁了，体态修长、皮肤白皙、身材瘦削，但绝不屈服。她浅黄色头发的颜色正在变深。她还要面对长期的痛苦，而且在她孩子的意识里，她知道要忍受腿瘸的缺陷。","He was terrible to her now, like a temptation.She had devoted herself to her children and her church.Joyce was once more on her feet; but, alas! lame, with iron supports to her leg, and a little crutch.It was strange how she had grown into a long, pallid, wild little thing.Strange that the pain had not made her soft and docile, but had brought out a wild, almost maenad temper in the child.She was seven, and long and white and thin, but by no means subdued.Her blonde hair was darkening.She still had long sufferings to face, and, in her own childish consciousness, the stigma of her lameness to bear."
"她忍受了这一点。她拥有几乎近乎狂暴的勇气，仿佛是一件细长、崭新的武器，充满了生气。她感谢母亲对她的所有关爱。她会永远站她母亲一边。但她偶尔也会发现父亲好脾气背后的绝望。","And she bore it.An almost maenad courage seemed to possess her, as if she were a long, thin, young weapon of life.She acknowledged all her mother’s care.She would stand by her mother for ever.But some of her father’s fine-tempered desperation flashed in her."
"当埃格伯特看到他的小女儿可怕地跛着脚走路的时候——不光是跛着脚，简直是在跛着脚、傻里傻气地踉跄，他的心就会再次因为懊恼而变得坚硬，就像回了火的钢一样。他和他的小女儿之间有一种默契：不是我们所谓的爱，而是一种血缘关系，就像士兵和武器之间的关系那样。他对待她的方式带着一丝讥讽的意味，与威妮弗雷德的深沉、直白的牵挂和照顾形成了鲜明的对照。孩子回了他一个带着一丝讥讽和轻率的微笑，这种奇怪的无礼行为反而让威妮弗雷德显得更忧郁、更诚挚了。","When Egbert saw his little girl limping horribly—not only limping but lurching horribly in crippled, childish way, his heart again hardened with chagrin, like steel that is tempered again.There was a tacit understanding between him and his little girl: not what we would call love, but a weapon-like kinship.There was a tiny touch of irony in his manner towards her, contrasting sharply with Winifred’s heavy, unleavened solicitude and care.The child flickered back to him with an answering little smile of irony and recklessness: an odd flippancy which made Winifred only the more sombre and earnest."
"马歇尔一家为孩子想尽了办法，操尽了心，寻求各种方法来挽救她的腿，让她能自由活动。他们不遗余力，不惜金钱，不惜一切意志力量。凭着他们全部的稳健、强大的意志力，他们决意要让乔伊斯保全她的活动的自由，找回她野性、自由的优雅。即使找回这种优雅要花很长时间，也在所不惜。","The Marshalls took endless thought and trouble for the child, searching out every means to save her limb and her active freedom.They spared no effort and no money, they spared no strength of will.With all their slow, heavy power of will they willed that Joyce should save her liberty of movement, should win back her wild, free grace.Even if it took a long time to recover, it should be recovered."
"情况就是如此。乔伊斯忍受了一星期又一星期、一月又一月严酷而痛苦的治疗。她感谢这些为她付出的可敬的努力。但她那像火焰般不顾一切的精神是她父亲给的。是他给了她所有的魅力。他和她就像某个被禁的秘密社团的成员，互相了解，但不一定能认出对方。他们，作为父亲和孩子，有着共同的知识，相同的生活秘密。但是，孩子体面地呆在母亲的阵营里，而父亲却像以实玛利一样在外面游荡，只是有时来到家里的营火边坐上一两个小时，或一两个晚上，像以实玛利一样奇怪地沉默和紧张。模仿着他在沉默中听到的零星话语，完全抛弃了家庭的传统。","So the situation stood.And Joyce submitted, week after week, month after month to the tyranny and pain of the treatment.She acknowledged the honourable effort on her behalf.But her flamy reckless spirit was her father’s.It was he who had all the glamour for her.He and she were like members of some forbidden secret society who know one another but may not recognize one another.Knowledge they had in common, the same secret of life, the father and the child.But the child stayed in the camp of her mother, honourably, and the father wandered outside like Ishmael, only coming sometimes to sit in the home for an hour or two, an evening or two beside the camp fire, like Ishmael, in a curious silence and tension, with the mocking answer of the desert speaking out of his silence, and annulling the whole convention of the domestic home."
"他的出现对威妮弗雷德而言仿佛是极大的痛苦。她祈祷让他离开。他眉宇间的那条小缝，那似附身在他脸上的隐约的、邪恶的微笑，特别是那胜利者的孤独感，都展示着以实玛利的品性。还有他挺拔、柔韧的身躯，就像一个符号。他站立的样子，那么安静，那么有诱惑力，像一个笔直、顺从的生命符号。那生气勃勃的身体面对着她沮丧的灵魂时，对她来说是一种折磨。他像一个顺从的、活生生的偶像，在她眼前晃动，她觉得如果她看了他，她就要倒霉了。","His presence was almost an anguish to Winifred.She prayed against it.That little cleft between his brow, that flickering, wicked, little smile that seemed to haunt his face, and above all, the triumphant loneliness, the Ishmael quality.And then the erectness of his supple body, like a symbol.The very way he stood, so quiet, so insidious, like an erect, supple symbol of life, the living body, confronting her downcast soul, was torture to her.He was like a supple living idol moving before her eyes, and she felt if she watched him she was damned."
"他来了，并且在她的小家里过得舒适、自在。当他在那里，以他自己的方式悄然走动时，她感到她为了生活而选择的整个伟大的舍弃法则仿佛都失效了。正是他的存在让她生活的法则不再有效。他替代了什么呢？啊，她硬起心肠回避这个问题。","And he came and made himself at home in her little home.When he was there, moving in his own quiet way, she felt as if the whole great law of sacrifice, by which she had elected to live, were annulled.He annulled by his very presence the laws of her life.And what did he substitute?Ah, against that question she hardened herself in recoil."
"她只得任由他在跟前四处走——穿着衬衫，用他那嘶哑的男高音跟孩子们讲话，这对她来说太糟糕了。安纳贝尔非常喜欢他，他也会逗这个小女孩玩。那个小不点，巴巴拉，则对他半信半疑。她生来就对他很陌生。但是，即使是保姆看见他那从衬衫裂口处露出的肩膀上的白皙肌肤时，都认为是一种羞耻。","It was awful to her to have to have him about—moving about in his shirt-sleeves, speaking in his tenor, throaty voice to the children.Annabel simply adored him, and he teased the little girl.The baby, Barbara, was not sure of him.She had been born a stranger to him.But even the nurse, when she saw his white shoulder of flesh through the slits of his torn shirt, thought it a shame."
"威妮弗雷德认为那不过是他对付她的又一件武器。","Winifred felt it was only another weapon of his against her."
"“你还有别的衬衫——为什么你要穿这件都破了的旧衣服，埃格伯特？”她说。","‘You have other shirts—why do you wear that old one that is all torn, Egbert?’ she said."
"“我干脆把它穿烂得了。”他机巧地说。","‘I may as well wear it out,’ he said subtly."
"他知道她是不会主动为他补衣服的。她不会补衣服。不，她也不愿意补。难道她没有自己的神要供奉吗？她会背叛他们，去信奉他的巴力和亚斯他录吗？（注：“巴力”和“亚斯他录”为《旧约》中的异邦邪神）对她来说，他剑拔弩张的存在太可怕了。那似乎废除了她和她的信仰，就像另一种启示。他像一个被召来与她作对的闪闪发亮的偶像，一个也许会取胜的、活生生的偶像。","He knew she would not offer to mend it for him.She could not.And no, she would not.Had she not her own gods to honour?And could she betray them, submitting to his Baal and Ashtaroth?And it was terrible to her, his unsheathed presence, that seemed to annul her and her faith, like another revelation.Like a gleaming idol evoked against her, a vivid life-idol that might triumph."
"他来了，又走了——她坚持着。接着，大战爆发了。他不是一个自甘堕落的男人。他不能放任自己。他有着纯正的英国血统，就算别人以性命相要挟，要他作恶，他也不会作恶。","He came and he went—and she persisted.And then the great war broke out.He was a man who could not go to the dogs.He could not dissipate himself.He was pure-bred in his Englishness, and even when he would have killed to be vicious, he could not."
"所以，当战争爆发时，他整个本能就是反对它：反对战争。他没有一丁点要征服外国人或出力杀死他们的想法。他没有“英帝国”的概念，《统治不列颠》（注：《统治不列颠》是一首英国爱国歌曲，歌颂英国海军在海洋上的统治力）对他来说只是一个笑话。他有着纯正的英国血统，来自优良的种族。而当他真正成为自己时，他也不会由于他的英国血统而更具有侵略性，就像一朵玫瑰不会因为它的带刺而具有攻击性一样。","So when the war broke out his whole instinct was against it: against war.He had not the faintest desire to overcome any foreigners or to help in their death.He had no conception of Imperial England, and Rule Britannia was just a joke to him.He was a pure-blooded Englishman, perfect in his race, and when he was truly himself he could no more have been aggressive on the score of his Englishness than a rose can be aggressive on the score of its rosiness."
"不，他不想去贬低德国而抬高英国。对他来说，德国人和英国人之间的区别不是好与坏的区别。而是蓝色的水中花和红色或白色的林间花之间的区别：仅仅是不同而已。就像野猪和野熊之间的不同。一个人是好还是坏取决于他的本性，而不是他的国籍。","No, he had no desire to defy Germany and to exalt England.The distinction between German and English was not for him the distinction between good and bad.It was the distinction between blue water-flowers and red or white bush-blossoms: just difference.The difference between the wild boar and the wild bear.And a man was good or bad according to his nature, not according to his nationality."
"埃格伯特有着良好的教养，这来自他天生的同情心。要去憎恨一整个民族，是完全不合他本性的。某些人他不喜欢，另一些人他喜欢，而对于大多数人，他则一无所知。某些行为他不喜欢，某些行为在他看来似乎很自然，而对于大多数行为，他则没有什么特别的感觉。","Egbert was well-bred, and this was part of his natural understanding.It was merely unnatural to him to hate a nation @en bloc@.Certain individuals he disliked, and others he liked, and the mass he knew nothing about.Certain deeds he disliked, certain deeds seemed natural to him, and about most deeds he had no particular feeling."
"然而，他却有着一种最深刻的、来自纯正血统的本性。他不可避免地拒绝接纳大众强加给他的感觉。他的感觉是他自己的，他的同情是他自己的，而且他永远不愿背弃它们。难道仅仅因为那些乌合之众期望他这么做，一个人就应该放弃他的真知和自我吗？","He had, however, the one deepest pure-bred instinct.He recoiled inevitably from having his feelings dictated to him by the mass feeling.His feelings were his own, his understanding was his own, and he would never go back on either, willingly.Shall a man become inferior to his own true knowledge and self, just because the mob expects it of him?"
"埃格伯特敏锐地感受到了，而且毫无疑问，他岳父也感受到了，不过是以一种粗鄙、更具战斗性的方式。尽管这两个男人有很多不同，他们却是两个真正的英国人，他们有着几乎完全相同的本性。","What Egbert felt subtly and without question, his father-in-law felt also in a rough, more combative way.Different as the two men were, they were two real Englishmen, and their instincts were almost the same."
"戈弗雷•马歇尔认真思考着世界上的事。这些事中包括德国的军事入侵，英国关于自由和“和平征服”的非军事观点——即工业主义。即使在军国主义和工业主义之间进行选择也是一个罪恶的选择，这位老人肯定他必然选择后者。他灵魂因为对权力的直觉而敏锐。","And Godfrey Marshall had the world to reckon with.There was German military aggression, and the English non-military idea of liberty and the ‘conquests of peace’—meaning industrialism.Even if the choice between militarism and industrialism were a choice of evils, the elderly man asserted his choice of the latter, perforce.He whose soul was quick with the instinct of power."
"埃格伯特只是拒绝思考世界上的事。他甚至拒绝在德国军国主义和英国工业主义之间做选择。他两者都不选。至于暴行，他看不起那些犯下暴行的人，把他们归于低等罪犯之类。犯罪不具有民族性。","Egbert just refused to reckon with the world.He just refused even to decide between German militarism and British industrialism.He chose neither.As for atrocities, he despised the people who committed them as inferior criminal types.There was nothing national about crime."
"然而，战争！战争！只是战争！不论正义与否，而只是战争本身。他应该入伍吗？他应该把自己交付给战争吗？这个问题在他脑海里逗留了好几个星期。这不是因为他认为英国是正确的而德国是错误的。也许德国是错误的，但他拒绝做出选择。不是因为他受到了鼓舞。不是。而只是——战争。","And yet, war!War!Just war!Not right or wrong, but just war itself.Should he join?Should he give himself over to war?The question was in his mind for some weeks.Not because he thought England was right and Germany wrong.Probably Germany was wrong, but he refused to make a choice.Not because he felt inspired.No.But just—war."
"他怕入伍会自己置身于他人的权力之下，和一个民主军队的暴民精神的权力之下。他应该把自己交出去吗？他应该把自己的生命和躯体交由某个他明知在精神上比自己更低等的东西控制吗？他应该献身于一种低等控制权吗？他应该这样吗？他应该背叛自我吗？","The deterrent was, the giving himself over into the power of other men, and into the power of the mob-spirit of a democratic army.Should he give himself over?Should he make over his own life and body to the control of something which he knew was inferior, in spirit, to his own self?Should he commit himself into the power of an inferior control?Should he?Should he betray himself?"
"他将置身于比自己更低等的人的权力之下，他明白这一点。他将使自己屈服。他将被那些卑微的士兵们——乃至军官们呼来唤去。他生来自由，成长也是自由的。他应该这样做吗？","He was going to put himself into the power of his inferiors, and he knew it.He was going to subjugate himself.He was going to be ordered about by petty canaille of non-commissioned officers—and even commissioned officers.He who was born and bred free.Should he do it?"
"他找到妻子，跟她谈话。","He went to his wife, to speak to her."
"“我应该去参军吗，威妮弗雷德？”","‘Shall I join up, Winifred?’"
"她沉默着。她本性对此也是完全反对的。然而一种强烈的愤恨之感促使她回答：","She was silent.Her instinct also was dead against it.And yet a certain profound resentment made her answer:"
"“你的三个孩子指望着你。我不知道你是否想过这个问题。”","‘You have three children dependent on you.I don’t know whether you have thought of that.’"
"战争刚爆发三个月不到，旧的战前观点仍然存在。","It was still only the third month of the war, and the old pre-war ideas were still alive."
"“当然。但这对他们的影响不会太大。至少我可以一天挣到一先令。”","‘Of course.But it won’t make much difference to them.I shall be earning a shilling a day, at least.’"
"“我想，你最好跟父亲说说。”她心情沉重地缓缓答道。","‘You’d better speak to father, I think,’ she replied heavily."
"埃格伯特找到他岳父。老人的心里满是愤恨。","Egbert went to his father-in-law.The elderly man’s heart was full of resentment."
"“我应当说，”他很不和气地说，“这是你能做的最好的事情。”","‘I should say,’ he said rather sourly, ‘it is the best thing you could do.’"
"埃格伯特立即就去参军了，当了一名列兵。他被派到了轻型火炮部队。","Egbert went and joined up immediately, as a private soldier.He was drafted into the light artillery."
"威妮弗雷德现在对他有了一个新的责任：对一个在对世界履行责任的丈夫履行妻子的责任。她仍然爱他。她会永远爱他，只要尘世的爱情依然存在。但她现在活着是基于责任。当作为一个士兵的他穿着卡其布军装回来时，作为一个妻子，她顺从他。这是她的责任。然而她再也无法做到完全顺从他的激情。某种东西永远地阻止了她：这也可能是她内心最深处的选择。","Winifred now had a new duty towards him: the duty of a wife towards a husband who is himself performing his duty towards the world.She loved him still.She would always love him, as far as earthly love went.But it was duty she now lived by.When he came back to her in khaki, a soldier, she submitted to him as a wife.It was her duty.But to his passion she could never again fully submit.Something prevented her, for ever: even her own deepest choice."
"他又回到军营。他不适合当一名现代士兵。穿着笨重、粗糙、丑陋的卡其军装，他美好的体格都看不到了，就像他已经死了一般。在军营里可怕的亲密关系中，他那天生就十分优良的敏感性已经降低了。但既然已经选择了，他就得接受。一种令人生厌的微妙表情出现在他脸上，是那种自甘堕落的男人的表情。","He went back again to camp.It did not suit him to be a modern soldier.In the thick, gritty, hideous khaki his subtle physique was extinguished as if he had been killed.In the ugly intimacy of the camp his thoroughbred sensibilities were just degraded.But he had chosen, so he accepted.An ugly little look came on to his face, of a man who has accepted his own degradation."
"早春时候，威妮弗雷德去了克罗坎。那时，那里的报春花正在开放，榛树丛上也缀满了花朵。她有点想跟埃格伯特重归于好了，现在他大多数日子都是被禁锢在军营里。经过在伦敦八九个月的痛苦不堪的生活后，再次看到花园和公地，乔伊斯高兴得不得了。她仍然瘸着腿。她腿上仍有铁支架。虽然敏捷性因为跛腿而下降，她还是疯狂地到处蹒跚而行。","In the early spring Winifred went down to Crockham to be there when primroses were out, and the tassels hanging on the hazel-bushes.She felt something like a reconciliation towards Egbert, now he was a prisoner in camp most of his days.Joyce was wild with delight at seeing the garden and the common again, after the eight or nine months of London and misery.She was still lame.She still had the irons up her leg.But she lurched about with a wild, crippled agility."
"周末时，埃格伯特回来了，穿着他那粗糙、笨重、砂纸似的卡其布军装，打着绑腿，戴着特别难看的军帽。而且，他看起来很糟糕。他脸色有些肮脏，嘴唇有点溃疡，似乎他吃得太多或喝得太多，或是他的血变得不怎么干净了。过着军营生活的他很健康，但却相当难看。那儿不适合他。","Egbert came for a week-end, in his gritty, thick, sand-paper khaki and puttees and the hideous cap.Nay, he looked terrible.And on his face a slightly impure look, a little sore on his lip, as if he had eaten too much or drunk too much or let his blood become a little unclean.He was almost uglily healthy, with the camp life.It did not suit him."
"威妮弗雷德等着他，带着些许责任感和牺牲的激情，愿意为这个士兵服务，如果不是为了这个男人的话。这只会让他内心感到有点更加生厌。周末对他来说是种折磨：对军营的记忆、他在那儿生活的印象、甚至自己腿上穿着那令人憎恶的卡其布的情景都是折磨。他似乎感到那丑得出奇的衣服进入了他的血液，使它变得浑浊、肮脏。还有威妮弗雷德拒绝接受这个男人的同时，却时刻准备着为这个士兵服务。这让他的牙关咬得更紧了。孩子们正在到处跑着、玩耍着、呼喊着，他们很是矫揉造作，颇像来自那些有保姆和女家庭教师的书香门第的孩子们。还有，乔伊斯这么瘸！过上军营生活以后，他感到一切都已经变得不真实了。他的灵魂也正因如此而局促不安。星期一早上天刚亮，他就走了。他很高兴再次回到那真实而粗鄙的军营里去。","Winifred waited for him in a little passion of duty and sacrifice, willing to serve the soldier, if not the man.It only made him feel a little more ugly inside.The week-end was torment to him: the memory of the camp, the knowledge of the life he led there; even the sight of his own legs in that abhorrent khaki.He felt as if the hideous cloth went into his blood and made it gritty and dirty.Then Winifred so ready to serve the soldier, when she repudiated the man.And this made the grit worse between his teeth.And the children running around playing and calling in the rather mincing fashion of children who have nurses and governesses and literature in the family.And Joyce so lame!It had all become unreal to him, after the camp.It only set his soul on edge.He left at dawn on the Monday morning, glad to get back to the realness and vulgarity of the camp."
"威妮弗雷德再也没有在小屋见到他——只是在伦敦见过，那里才是他们的世界。但有时，也许是有朋友在那里的时候，他会独自去克罗坎。那样的话，他会在花园里劳作片刻。这个夏天，这地方仍然盛开着蓝色的牛舌草和大红的罂粟花，毛蕊花在空中摇曳着柔软的、毛绒绒的花枝——他很喜欢毛蕊花；当猫头鹰咕咕叫时，金银花会散发出阵阵香气，如记忆中的一般。然后，他跟朋友们，还有威妮弗雷德的姐妹们坐在火旁一起唱民歌。他穿上薄薄的平民服装，他的魅力、他的帅气，还有他身体柔软的优势，便又焕发出光芒。但威妮弗雷德不在那里。","Winifred would never meet him again at the cottage—only in London, where the world was with them.But sometimes he came alone to Crockham perhaps when friends were staying there.And then he would work awhile in his garden.This summer still it would flame with blue anchusas and big red poppies, the mulleins would sway their soft, downy erections in the air: he loved mulleins: and the honeysuckle would stream out scent like memory, when the owl was whooing.Then he sat by the fire with the friends and with Winifred’s sisters, and they sang the folk-songs.He put on thin civilian clothes and his charm and his beauty and the supple dominancy of his body glowed out again.But Winifred was not there."
"夏天结束的时候，他去佛兰德参加战斗。他似乎已经超脱了生活，超越了生活的羁绊。他几乎记不起他曾经的生活，就像一个正要从高处往下跳的人，只顾盯着他必须着地的地方。","At the end of the summer he went to Flanders, into action.He seemed already to have gone out of life, beyond the pale of life.He hardly remembered his life any more, being like a man who is going to take a jump from a height, and is only looking to where he must land."
"两个月里，他受了两次轻伤。但这不足以让他离开火线超过一天或两天。他们又一次主动撤退，同时阻挡敌人。他是在后卫部队——有三挺机关枪。乡村一切都好，战争还没有践踏它。只是空气似乎被打碎了，大地正等待着死亡。他参加的这次行动规模很小，并不重要。","He was twice slightly wounded, in two months.But not enough to put him off duty for more than a day or two.They were retiring again, holding the enemy back.He was in the rear—three machine-guns.The country was all pleasant, war had not yet trampled it.Only the air seemed shattered, and the land awaiting death.It was a small, unimportant action in which he was engaged."
"机枪就架在村子外面一个长满灌木的小丘上。但偶尔，很难说会从哪个方向传来步枪开火的刺耳爆裂声，以及更远处大炮的隆隆声。这个下午冷得像冬天一样。","The guns were stationed on a little bushy hillock just outside a village.But occasionally, it was difficult to say from which direction, came the sharp crackle of rifle-fire, and beyond, the far-off thud of cannon.The afternoon was wintry and cold."
"一名中尉站在梯子顶端的一个铁制小平台上，一边观测，一边紧张、机械地高声喊出目标的位置。空中传来关于射击方向的厉声喊叫，然后是预警性的倒数，再后来是“开火！”。子弹打了出去，机枪的活塞弹了回来，一声爆炸的巨响传来，空气中留下了一层薄薄的烟雾。接着其他两挺枪也开火了。然后是一段间歇。这位军官没弄清楚敌人的位置。小丘下面浓密的七叶树林里毫无动静。只是在远处，猛烈的交火声在继续，声音很远，让人感觉到安宁。","A lieutenant stood on a little iron platform at the top of the ladders, taking the sights and giving the aim, calling in a high, tense, mechanical voice.Out of the sky came the sharp cry of the directions, then the warning numbers, then ‘Fire!’The shot went, the piston of the gun sprang back, there was a sharp explosion, and a very faint film of smoke in the air.Then the other two guns fired, and there was a lull.The officer was uncertain of the enemy’s position.The thick clump of horse-chestnut trees below was without change.Only in the far distance the sound of heavy firing continued, so far off as to give a sense of peace."
"两旁的荆豆丛都是深色的，只有一些稀稀拉拉的花朵是黄色的。他在间歇时等着，几乎是不知不觉地就注意到了它们。他穿着他的衬衫，空气冰冷地拂过他的手臂。他的衬衫在肩膀处裂开了，皮肉露了出来。他蓬头垢面。但他脸色平静。在我们快要失去意识之前，好多事情会出现在意识里。","The gorse bushes on either hand were dark, but a few sparks of flowers showed yellow.He noticed them almost unconsciously as he waited, in the lull.He was in his shirt-sleeves, and the air came chill on his arms.Again his shirt was slit on the shoulders, and the flesh showed through.He was dirty and unkempt.But his face was quiet.So many things go out of consciousness before we come to the end of consciousness."
"在他的前方，下面是穿行在高高的草丛和荆豆丛之间的大道。他看见了泥泞的路上泛白的足迹和深深的车痕，部队就是从那里撤退的。现在，万籁俱寂。即使有声音传来，也是来自外界。他所处的地方仍然寂静、寒冷而安详。远方树林中的白色教堂看起来仿佛只是存在于想象中。","Before him, below, was the highroad, running between high banks of grass and gorse.He saw the whitish muddy tracks and deep scores in the road, where the part of the regiment had retired.Now all was still.Sounds that came, came from the outside.The place where he stood was still silent, chill, serene: the white church among the trees beyond seemed like a thought only."
"头顶上的军官发出尖声的喊叫，他闪电般迅速地做出了机械式反应。机械动作，纯粹是服从命令而做出的机械性枪击动作。纯粹是机械性枪击动作。它让灵魂没了负担，在黑暗中赤裸裸地沉思。最终，在根本不存在的涌流之上，灵魂独自沉思着，就像一只飞翔在昏暗的海面上的小鸟。","He moved into a lightning-like mechanical response at the sharp cry from the officer overhead.Mechanism, the pure mechanical action of obedience at the guns.Pure mechanical action at the guns.It left the soul unburdened, brooding in dark nakedness.In the end, the soul is alone, brooding on the face of the uncreated flux, as a bird on a dark sea."
"除了那条路、一只被打歪了的十字架和黑黝黝的秋天原野和树林，什么都看不见。在一块耕过的小高地上，出现了三个骑兵，看起来很小的样子。他们是我们这边的人。至于敌人，一个都没有。","Nothing could be seen but the road, and a crucifix knocked slanting and the dark, autumnal fields and woods.There appeared three horsemen on a little eminence, very small, on the crest of a ploughed field.They were our own men.Of the enemy, nothing."
"间歇在继续。然后，突然传来了厉声的命令，机枪指向了一个新的方向，随后是一阵紧张、激烈的开火。然而在最深处，灵魂还是那么孤单、阴郁而冷漠。","The lull continued.Then suddenly came sharp orders, and a new direction of the guns, and an intense, exciting activity.Yet at the centre the soul remained dark and aloof, alone."
"即便如此，灵魂还是听到了新声：那是一杆枪发出的新的、低沉的“啪啪”声，这枪声仿佛正好击打着他的心灵。他不停地快速扣动机关枪，大汗淋漓。但在他灵魂回响着一个新的、深沉的声音，比生命还深沉。他的感觉得到了证实，炮弹那可怕而轻微的声音传来。几乎突然之间，那声音变成一声刺耳、撕裂般的尖叫，要撕开生命的膜皮。","But even so, it was the soul that heard the new sound: the new, deep ‘papp!’ of a gun that seemed to touch right upon the soul.He kept up the rapid activity at the machine-gun, sweating.But in his soul was the echo of the new, deep sound, deeper than life.And in confirmation came the awful faint whistling of a shell, advancing almost suddenly into a piercing, tearing shriek that would tear through the membrane of life."
"他的耳朵听见了那声音，而他的灵魂也在紧张中听见了。当那东西呼啸而过，击落在很远的地方时，大家都松了口气。他听见了炮弹刺耳的爆炸声，还有士兵呼唤战马的声音。但他没有回过头去看。他只注意到一根结着红色浆果的冬青树枝，像一份礼品一样，落在下方的路上。","He heard it in his ears, but he heard it also in his soul, in tension.There was relief when the thing had swung by and struck, away beyond.He heard the hoarseness of its explosion, and the voice of the soldier calling to the horses.But he did not turn round to look.He only noticed a twig of holly with red berries fall like a gift on to the road below."
"不是现在，不是现在。你往哪里去，我也往哪里去（注：本句出自《旧约·路德记》1:16）。他在跟炮弹说话，还是在跟谁说话？你往哪里去，我也往哪里去。接着，又一颗炮弹轻微地呼啸着过来了。他的血流变缓、静止了，等着挨这一炮。它更近了，像某种可怕的风暴；他的血液失去了意识。然而，就在意识暂停的一瞬间，他看见沉重的炮弹猛扑向土地，砸进了右边乱石成堆的灌木丛中，泥土和石头被抛向了天空。似乎他没听到什么声音。泥土、石头还有灌木碎片再次落到地上，然后一切又归于不变的宁静。德国人找到了攻击目标。","Not this time, not this time.Whither thou goest I will go.Did he say it to the shell, or to whom?Whither thou goest I will go.Then, the faint whistling of another shell dawned, and his blood became small and still to receive it.It drew nearer, like some horrible blast of wind; his blood lost consciousness.But in the second of suspension he saw the heavy shell swoop to earth, into the rocky bushes on the right, and earth and stones poured up into the sky.It was as if he heard no sound.The earth and stones and fragments of bush fell to earth again, and there was the same unchanging peace.The Germans had got the aim."
"他们现在要转移吗？他们要撤退吗？是的。撤退前，军官正闪电般疾速地发出最后一道向敌人开火的命令。在快速的行动中，一颗炮弹在不知不觉中袭了过来。接着，在沉默中，在灵魂沉思的一瞬间，一个声音，连同一片黑暗，连同瞬间的剧痛和恐惧，终于炸开了。啊，他看见黑鸟正朝他飞来，这次是朝家里飞。只在一瞬间，生命和永恒就烧毁在极度痛苦的火海之中，然后便是沉甸甸的黑暗。","Would they move now?Would they retire?Yes.The officer was giving the last lightning-rapid orders to fire before withdrawing.A shell passed unnoticed in the rapidity of action.And then, into the silence, into the suspense where the soul brooded, finally crashed a noise and a darkness and a moment’s flaming agony and horror.Ah, he had seen the dark bird flying towards him, flying home this time.In one instant life and eternity went up in a conflagration of agony, then there was a weight of darkness."
"当某种东西开始在黑暗中微弱地挣扎时，他恢复了知觉，感到了巨大的重压和铿锵的声响。知道自己已死到临头！而在死之前，还要被迫回顾一遍。我命如此，连死亡也不例外。","When faintly something began to struggle in the darkness, a consciousness of himself, he was aware of a great load and a clanging sound.To have known the moment of death!And to be forced, before dying, to review it.So, fate, even in death."
"疼痛反复袭来。这似乎是从他的意识之外袭来的：像一只洪钟紧挨在身边铿锵作响。然而他知道那就是他自己。他必须把自己跟它联系起来。经过一次昏厥和一次新的挣扎，他确认痛苦来自头上，那里有片巨大的痛处在铿锵作响、反复发作。到那时为止，他还有自我意识。接着，就昏厥了。","There was a resounding of pain.It seemed to sound from the outside of his consciousness: like a loud bell clanging very near.Yet he knew it was himself.He must associate himself with it.After a lapse and a new effort, he identified a pain in his head, a large pain that clanged and resounded.So far he could identify himself with himself.Then there was a lapse."
"经过一段时间，他似乎又一次醒过来，逐渐醒过来，知道他在前线，而且被杀死了。他没有睁开眼睛。光不再属于他。他头上痛处的铿锵声送走了他仅剩的意识。于是，他从清醒状态中昏厥过去，无可奈何地、极不情愿地放弃了生命。","After a time he seemed to wake up again, and waking, to know that he was at the front, and that he was killed.He did not open his eyes.Light was not yet his.The clanging pain in his head rang out the rest of his consciousness.So he lapsed away from consciousness, in unutterable sick abandon of life."
"像死亡一样的意识渐渐恢复了过来。他被打中了头。开始，这只是一种模糊的推测。然而，随着疼痛的钟摆的左右摇晃，越摇越近，把他撞进意识的痛苦和痛苦的意识之间。他慢慢地有了意识——他一定是被打在了头上——打在左眉上；如果这样，会有血——眉上会有血吗？——他能感觉到左眼上的血吗？然后，那铿锵声似乎要爆开他的脑膜，像死亡一样疯狂。","Bit by bit, like a doom came the necessity to know.He was hit in the head.It was only a vague surmise at first.But in the swinging of the pendulum of pain, swinging ever nearer and nearer, to touch him into an agony of consciousness and a consciousness of agony, gradually the knowledge emerged—he must be hit in the head—hit on the left brow; if so, there would be blood—was there blood?—could he feel blood in his left eye?Then the clanging seemed to burst the membrane of his brain, like death-madness."
"他脸上有血吗？在流着热血吗？或者那是顺着他的面颊凝结的血？他光问这个问题就用了好几个小时：在黑暗中，时间不过是无法计量的痛苦。","Was there blood on his face?Was hot blood flowing?Or was it dry blood congealing down his cheek?It took him hours even to ask the question: time being no more than an agony in darkness, without measurement."
"睁开眼睛以后很长时间，他才知道他看见了什么——什么呢，什么呢，但要回想起是什么，却太费劲了。不，不，别去回想了！","A long time after he had opened his eyes he realized he was seeing something—something, something, but the effort to recall what was too great.No, no; no recall!"
"它们是不是在黑暗的天空中的星星？那可能是在黑暗的天空中的星星吗？星星？世界？啊，不，他不会知道了！对他来说，星星和世界都已经远去了。他闭上了双眼。没有星星，没有天空，没有世界。没有，没有！只有血一般浓稠的黑暗。这应该是一次大的昏厥了，他痛苦地陷入了血一般浓稠的黑暗中。","Were they the stars in the dark sky?Was it possible it was stars in the dark sky?Stars?The world?Ah, no, he could not know it!Stars and the world were gone for him, he closed his eyes.No stars, no sky, no world.No, No!The thick darkness of blood alone.It should be one great lapse into the thick darkness of blood in agony."
"死亡，啊，死亡！满世界都是血，血全都与死亡纠缠在一起。灵魂就像漆黑的血海上的最微弱的光。光在无风的风暴中摇曳着、拍打着、跳动着。希望它会熄灭，然而却做不到。","Death, oh, death!The world all blood, and the blood all writhing with death.The soul like the tiniest little light out on a dark sea, the sea of blood.And the light guttering, beating, pulsing in a windless storm, wishing it could go out, yet unable."
"曾经有过生活。曾经有过威妮弗雷德和他的孩子们。然而，在临死的痛苦之中努力捕捉记忆的点滴、过去生活的点滴，引起了他极大的反感。不，不！没有威妮弗雷德，没有孩子们。没有世界，没有人。宁愿痛苦地面对即将到来的灰飞烟灭，也不要这努力回忆过去引起的反感。宁愿把这可怕的工作继续下去，消亡在这死亡的黑色海洋中，粉身碎骨，也不要去触及过去的生活！忘掉吧！忘掉吧！彻底地，彻底地忘掉，在死亡中全然忘却。打破生命的核心和单元，在伟大的黑暗中消逝。只能如此。打断思绪，与这片黑暗融为一体，没有将来，也没有过去。让死亡的黑色海洋自己去解决将来的问题吧。让人类的意志破灭、停止吧。","There had been life.There had been Winifred and his children.But the frail death-agony effort to catch at straws of memory, straws of life from the past, brought on too great a nausea.No, No!No Winifred, no children.No world, no people.Better the agony of dissolution ahead than the nausea of the effort backwards.Better the terrible work should go forward, the dissolving into the black sea of death, in the extremity of dissolution, than that there should be any reaching back towards life.To forget!To forget!Utterly, utterly to forget, in the great forgetting of death.To break the core and the unit of life, and to lapse out on the great darkness.Only that.To break the clue, and mingle and commingle with the one darkness, without afterwards or forwards.Let the black sea of death itself solve the problem of futurity.Let the will of man break and give up."
"那是什么？亮光！可怕的亮光！那是人的影子吗？那是一条马腿吗？如此庞大——庞大，在他上面：巨大，巨大？","What was that?A light!A terrible light!Was it figures?Was it legs of a horse colossal—colossal above him: huge, huge?"
"德国人听到一声轻微的响动，吃了一惊。接着，在闪光弹的照耀下，在炮弹炸出来的土堆旁，他们看到了这张死去的脸。","The Germans heard a slight noise, and started.Then, in the glare of a light-bomb, by the side of the heap of earth thrown up by the shell, they saw the dead face."
