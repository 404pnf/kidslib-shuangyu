"神灵微笑时","When God Laughs"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"“神灵，神灵更为强大；时间在他们面前失色，所有人都向他们膜拜，所有的祈祷和忏悔都如焚香一样涌向他们；对，因为他们是神灵，费利斯。”","“The gods, the gods are stronger; timeFalls down before them, all men’s kneesBow, all men’s prayers and sorrows climbLike incense toward them; yea, for theseAre gods, Felise.”"
"卡奎奈兹终于放松了下来。他偷偷地瞥了一眼咯咯作响的窗户，抬头看看带着房梁的屋顶，听了一会儿东南风的怒吼，风张开咆哮的大口吞噬了那小屋。然后他把酒杯端在自己和火堆之间，看着这金黄色的酒，快乐地笑了起来。","Carquinez had relaxed finally.He stole a glance at the rattling windows, looked upward at the beamed roof, and listened for a moment to the savage roar of the southeaster as it caught the bungalow in its bellowing jaws.Then he held his glass between him and the fire and laughed for joy through the golden wine."
"“这酒很美，”他说，“真是醇香甜美。这是一个女人酿给穿灰长袍的圣徒们喝的酒。”","“It is beautiful,” he said.“It is sweetly sweet.It is a woman’s wine and it was made for gray-robed saints to drink.”"
"“这是我们在本地温暖的山丘上种的葡萄。”我带着身为加州人的自豪说，这种自豪一点都不为过。“你们昨天路上穿过的葡萄藤就产这种葡萄。”","“We grow it on our own warm hills,” I said, with pardonable California pride.“You rode up yesterday through the vines from which it was made.”"
"让卡奎奈兹放松下来绝对是值得的。直到他感到葡萄藤的温热在他的血液中歌唱时，他才表现出真正的自己。他是个艺术家，真的，他一直是个艺术家。但是，不知怎么地，将那些高调子从他的思维中去除，他很容易变得像英国的星期日一样无趣——他虽然不像其他人那么无趣，但和他真实的自己、活泼风趣的人物蒙特·卡奎奈兹相比，就显得无趣许多。","It was worth while to get Carquinez to loosen up.Nor was he ever really himself until he felt the mellow warmth of the vine singing in his blood. He was an artist, it is true, always an artist; but somehow, sober the high pitch and lilt went out of his thought-processes and he was prone to be as deadly dull as a British Sunday—not dull as other men are dull, but dull when measured by the sprightly wight that Monte Carquinez was when he was really himself."
"但不能单凭这个就推断说我亲爱的朋友、亲密的伙伴卡奎奈兹是个酒鬼。绝不是。他很少犯错。就像我刚才说的，他是个艺术家。他知道自己什么时候就喝够了，对他，喝够了的时候内心就会感到平静——那种在你我清醒之时才能感受到的平静。","From all this it must not be inferred that Carquinez, who is my dear friend and dearer comrade, was a sot.Far from it.He rarely erred.As I have said, he was an artist.He knew when he had enough, and enough, with him, was equilibrium—the equilibrium that is yours and mine when we are sober."
"他与生俱来地懂得明智的节制，这种节制是希腊人特有的气质。但他一点也不像希腊人。“我是阿兹特克人，我是印加人，我是西班牙人。”我听他这样说过。而实际上，他看起来也真的像几个奇怪而古老的种族的混血儿，不管是他黝黑的皮肤还是不对称且有些原始的面部特征，都给人这样的感觉。一对深拱形的眉毛下面两只眼睛离得很远，眼珠黑得有些粗野，眼睛前面永远是一大撮蓬松的黑发，他透过这撮头发看人的样子就好像灌木丛里走出的无赖。他总是穿着一件柔软的法兰绒衬衫，外面披一件天鹅绒和灯芯绒做的夹克，系一条红色的领带。红色代表红旗（他曾与巴黎的社会主义者生活在一起），象征着鲜血和兄弟之情。而且，他的头上向来都只戴一顶皮边墨西哥帽。甚至有传闻说他出生时就戴着这顶奇特的帽子。以我的经验来看，看见这个墨西哥帽在皮卡迪利大街挥手打车，或在纽约上流街区被拥攘的人群挤来挤去，真是太有趣刺激的一件事了。","His was a wise and instinctive temperateness that savored of the Greek.Yet he was far from Greek.“I am Aztec, I am Inca, I am Spaniard,” I have heard him say.And in truth he looked it, a compound of strange and ancient races, what of his swarthy skin and the asymmetry and primitiveness of his features.His eyes, under massively arched brows, were wide apart and black with the blackness that is barbaric, while before them was perpetually falling down a great black mop of hair through which he gazed like a roguish satyr from a thicket.He invariably wore a soft flannel shirt under his velvet-corduroy jacket, and his necktie was red.This latter stood for the red flag (he had once lived with the socialists of Paris), and it symbolized the blood and brotherhood of man.Also, he had never been known to wear anything on his head save a leather-banded sombrero.It was even rumored that he had been born with this particular piece of headgear.And in my experience it was provocative of nothing short of sheer delight to see that Mexican sombrero hailing a cab in Piccadilly or storm-tossed in the crush for the New York Elevated."
"就像我说过的，卡奎奈兹一喝酒就能清醒过来——“就像上帝对粘土吹一口生命之气，黏土就有了生命一样”，他自己就是这么形容的。我坦白：他和上帝亲密得有不敬之嫌；但我必须说明他对上帝绝无任何亵渎之意。他始终都很诚实，而且，由于他是一个矛盾的混合体，因此仍被不了解他的人所深深误解。他有时候像尖声嘶叫的野蛮人一样原始，其他时候他却像少女一样心思细腻，像西班牙人一样敏感。而且——好了，难道他不是阿兹特克人吗？印加人？西班牙人？","As I have said, Carquinez was made quick by wine—“as the clay was made quick when God breathed the breath of life into it,” was his way of saying it.I confess that he was blasphemously intimate with God; and I must add that there was no blasphemy in him.He was at all times honest, and, because he was compounded of paradoxes, greatly misunderstood by those who did not know him.He could be as elementally raw at times as a screaming savage; and at other times as delicate as a maid, as subtle as a Spaniard.And—well, was he not Aztec?Inca?Spaniard?"
"现在，我必须请求您原谅我对他长篇累牍的描述。（他是我的朋友，我很喜欢他。）当他走近火堆、在酒精的作用下对着火堆大笑时，房子正在暴风雨中摇摇晃晃。他看着我，眼睛里闪着光彩，带着机敏，我明白他终于恢复了自己本来的样子。","And now I must ask pardon for the space I have given him.(He is my friend, and I love him.)The house was shaking to the storm, as he drew closer to the fire and laughed at it through his wine.He looked at me, and by the added lustre of his eye, and by the alertness of it, I knew that at last he was pitched in his proper key."
"“这么说，你认为自己已经胜过神了吗？”他问。","“And so you think you’ve won out against the gods?” he demanded."
"“为什么是胜过神？”","“Why the gods?”"
"“除了他们，还有谁的意志给人类餍足感呢？”他大叫。","“Whose will but theirs has put satiety upon man?” he cried."
"“那我心中想要摆脱餍足感的意志呢？”我得意地问。","“And whence the will in me to escape satiety?” I asked triumphantly."
"“还是神给的，”他笑着说，“我们都在玩着他们的游戏。他们洗牌发牌……然后下注。不要以为你从这些疯狂的城市逃走就能摆脱他们。你和你爬满葡萄藤的丘陵，你的日出日落，你的粗茶淡饭，你的普通生活，都不例外！","“Again the gods,” he laughed.“It is their game we play.They deal and shuffle all the cards… and take the stakes.Think not that you have escaped by fleeing from the mad cities.You with your vine-clad hills, your sunsets and your sunrises, your homely fare and simple round of living!"
"“从我来到这里我就在观察你。你没有赢。你投降了。你与敌人达成了协议。你承认自己很累。你举起了疲惫的白旗。你贴出一则告示，大意是自己的生活越来越消沉。你逃避了生活。你耍了一个花招，卑劣的花招。你在游戏面前畏缩不前了。你拒绝玩这个游戏。你把你的牌扔到了桌底下，然后跑开藏了起来，藏在这丘陵里。”","“I’ve watched you ever since I came.You have not won.You have surrendered.You have made terms with the enemy.You have made confession that you are tired.You have flown the white flag of fatigue.You have nailed up a notice to the effect that life is ebbing down in you.You have run away from life.You have played a trick, shabby trick.You have balked at the game.You refuse to play.You have thrown your cards under the table and run away to hide, here amongst your hills.”"
"他眼光闪烁，把挡在眼前的直发向后一甩，手里一直在卷一根长长的棕色的墨西哥烟卷，几乎没有停下来。","He tossed his straight hair back from his flashing eyes, and scarcely interrupted to roll a long, brown, Mexican cigarette."
"“但神知道。这是老招数了。世世代代都有人用这个招数，但都以失败告终。神知道怎么对付你这样的人。追求是为了拥有，而拥有了就会厌烦。　　所以你自以为聪明，拒绝再追求。你选择了停止。很好。你会厌烦停止的。你说你摆脱了餍足感。你只是用它换来了衰老。衰老是餍足的另一种说法。它是餍足的伪装。呸！”","“But the gods know.It is an old trick.All the generations of man have tried it...and lost.The gods know how to deal with such as you.To pursue is to possess, and to possess is to be sated.And so you, in your wisdom, have refused any longer to pursue.You have elected surcease.Very well.You will become sated with surcease.You say you have escaped satiety!You have merely bartered it for senility.And senility is another name for satiety.It is satiety’s masquerade.Bah!”"
"“但是看看我！”我大叫道。","“But look at me!” I cried."
"卡奎奈兹是个魔鬼，他总是把别人的心掏出来揉碎。","Carquinez was ever a demon for haling one’s soul out and making rags and tatters of it."
"他上下打量我，令我浑身不自在。","He looked me witheringly up and down."
"“什么衰老的迹象你都看不到。”我挑衅道。","“You see no signs,” I challenged."
"“腐败隐藏在内，”他反驳道，“你已经熟透了。”","“Decay is insidious,” he retorted.“You are rotten ripe.”"
"我笑了笑，原谅了他的出言不逊。但他拒绝被我原谅。","I laughed and forgave him for his very deviltry.But he refused to be forgiven."
"“难道我不知道吗？”他问，“神总是会赢。我曾见过人类数年来玩着一场看似会赢的游戏。到最后，他们还是输了。”","“Do I not know?” he asked.“The gods always win.I have watched men play for years what seemed a winning game.In the end they lost.”"
"“你从未犯过错吗？”我问。","“Don’t you ever make mistake?” I asked."
"他吐着烟圈，深思良久，然后才回答。","He blew many meditative rings of smoke before replying."
"“当然犯过，有一次，我差点被愚弄了。我来跟你讲讲。他是马文·菲斯克。你记得他吗？他长着但丁式的脸，有一颗诗人的心，唱着凡人的颂歌，还记得吗，就是那个爱的牧师？还有埃塞尔·贝尔德，你一定也记得她吧。”","“Yes, I was nearly fooled, once.Let me tell you.There was Marvin Fiske.You remember him?And his Dantesque face and poet’s soul singing his chant of the flesh, the very priest of Love?And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.”"
"“那个热心的圣徒。”我说。","“A warm saint,” I said."
"“就是她！她像爱一样神圣，但比爱还要甜美！只是个为爱而生的女人，但是——我该怎么说呢——就像你这里弥漫着花香一样，她浑身都散发着神圣感。是的，他们两个结婚了。他们和神玩花样——”","“That is she!Holy as Love, and sweeter!Just a woman, made for love; and yet—how shall I say?—drenched through with holiness as your own air here is with the perfume of flowers.Well, they married.They played a hand with the gods—”"
"“他们赢了，赢得十分光彩！”我插了一句。","“And they won, they gloriously won!” I broke in."
"卡奎奈兹悲悯地看着我，他的声音好像丧钟：","Carquinez looked at me pityingly, and his voice was like a funeral bell."
"“他们输了。彻底惨败。”","“They lost.They supremely, colossally lost.”"
"“但世人不这样认为。”我冷冷地反驳。","“But the world believes otherwise,” I ventured coldly."
"“世人只是妄加揣测。他们只看见了事情的表面。但我知道。你有没有想过她为什么戴上面纱，把自己关进那悲惨的修道院，过活死人的生活？”","“The world conjectures.The world sees only the face of things.But I know.Has it ever entered your mind to wonder why she took the veil, buried herself in that dolorous convent of the living dead?”"
"“那是因为她太爱他了，他死的时候……”","“Because she loved him so, and when he died...”"
"看到卡奎奈兹冷笑，我把到嘴边的话又咽了回去。","Speech was frozen on my lips by Carquinez’s sneer."
"“陈词滥调，”他说，“和机器织出的棉斜纹布一样千篇一律。”世人的判断呀！世人知道的可真多。和你一样，她逃避了生活。她被打败了。她举起了疲惫的白旗。没有哪个被困的城市举旗投降时，像她这样痛苦辛酸、泪水涟涟。","“A pat answer,” he said, “machine-made like a piece of cotton-drill.The world’s judgment!And much the world knows about it.Like you, she fled from life.She was beaten.She flung out the white flag of fatigue.And no beleaguered city ever flew that flag in such bitterness and tears."
"“现在让我来告诉你整个故事，而且你必须相信我，因为我知道原委。他们已经思考过餍足的问题。他们尊崇爱。他们非常清楚爱的价值。他们太热衷于爱了，他们愿意让爱永远地、暖暖地、激动地活在他们心里。他们欢迎爱的到来，同时害怕爱会离开。","“Now I shall tell you the whole tale, and you must believe me, for I know.They had pondered the problem of satiety.They loved Love.They knew to the uttermost farthing the value of Love.They loved him so well that they were fain to keep him always, warm and athrill in their hearts.They welcomed his coming; they feared to have him depart."
"“他们相信，爱是一种欲望，一种甜蜜的煎熬。爱总是在寻找解脱，但当爱找到了它想要的，它就会死去。被拒绝的爱将继续存在，得到回应的爱却会消亡。你听懂了吗？他们明白，渴望自己已经拥有的事物不符合生活的法则。边享用食物边感到饥饿——人类从未实现过这个壮举。餍足的问题。就是这样。在佳肴盛宴的面前，既要想用还要保有饥饿感。这就是他们的难题，因为他们尊崇爱。他们经常讨论这个问题，爱的甜蜜热情在他们的眼中闪耀；爱的鲜血泛上他们的脸颊；爱的音韵时时融入他们的言语，一会儿是他们喉中发出的颤音，一会儿又给他们的语调添上一分妙不可言的轻柔，这种轻柔是爱独有的声音。“我是怎么知道这些的呢？我看到了——很多。我从她的日记里了解了更多。我在里面看到了一段她引自菲奥纳·麦克劳德的话：“确实，那恍惚的声音、那黄昏时的低语、那如露珠般甜美的呼吸、那个以火焰为翼的弹琴人（谁都没见过他，他只乍现于欢欣的虹光中，或是激情迸发时的闪光间），这个我们称为阿莫尔的精致的谜，来了，来到了狂热的梦想者眼里；他没有唱着人人都能听到的歌曲，也没有吹起通俗易懂的轻快弦乐，而是带着欣喜若狂的神情，饱含欲望、沉默不语，却又意味深长。”　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　","“Love was desire, they held, a delicious pain.He was ever seeking easement, and when he found that for which he sought, he died.Love denied was Love alive; Love granted was Love deceased.Do you follow me?They saw it was not the way of life to be hungry for what it has.To eat and still be hungry—man has never accomplished that feat.The problem of satiety.That is it.To have and to keep the sharp famine-edge of appetite at the groaning board.This was their problem, for they loved Love.Often did they discuss it, with all Love’s sweet ardors brimming in their eyes; his ruddy blood spraying their cheeks; his voice playing in and out with their voices, now hiding as a tremolo in their throats, and again shading a tone with that ineffable tenderness which he alone can utter.“How do I know all this?I saw—much.More I learned from her diary.This I found in it, from Fiona Macleod: ‘For, truly, that wandering voice, that twilight-whisper, that breath so dewy-sweet, that flame-winged lute-player whom none sees but for a moment, in a rainbow-shimmer of joy, or a sudden lightning-flare of passion, this exquisite mystery we call Amor, comes, to some rapt visionaries at least, not with a song upon the lips that all may hear, or with blithe viol of public music, but as one wrought by ecstasy, dumbly eloquent with desire.’"
"“如何留住那个以火焰为翼、饱含欲望、沉默无语、却又意味深长的弹琴人呢？满足他就是失去他。他们之间的爱是伟大的。他们的粮仓储备充足，但他们却想保持如饥似渴的感觉，以免他们之间的爱变得乏味。","“How to keep the flame-winged lute-player with his dumb eloquence of desire?To feast him was to lose him.Their love for each other was a great love.Their granaries were overflowing with plenitude; yet they wanted to keep the sharp famine-edge of their love undulled."
"“他们也不是初次陷入爱河的雏鸟，孱弱瘦小，一味空想。他们精力充沛，心智成熟。在相遇之前，他们也曾爱过别人；而在那些日子里，他们的爱抚扼制了爱，他们的亲吻杀死了爱，他们把爱埋葬在了餍足的陷阱之中。","“Nor were they lean little fledglings theorizing on the threshold of Love.They were robust and realized souls.They had loved before, with others, in the days before they met; and in those days they had throttled Love with caresses, and killed him with kisses, and buried him in the pit of satiety."
"“他们不是冷血的幽灵。这个男人和这个女人。他们是有热血的人。他们的血液中丝毫没有撒克逊人的严肃。血液的颜色就像落日一样红。鲜血让他们红光满面。他们在气质上与法国人接近，乐享肉体的欢娱。他们是理想主义者，但他们的理想主义是法式的。他们的血液里没有掺杂着一点冰冷黯淡的液体，而英国人的血管里全是这种液体。他们完全不信奉禁欲主义。他们是美国人，虽然源自英国，但英国人克制和自我克制的精神却不属于他们。","“They were not cold wraiths, this man and woman.They were warm human.They had no Saxon soberness in their blood.The color of it was sunset-red.They glowed with it.Temperamentally theirs was the French joy in the flesh.They were idealists, but their idealism was Gallic.It was not tempered by the chill and sombre fluid that for the English serves as blood.There was no stoicism about them.They were Americans, descended out of the English, and yet the refraining and self-denying of the English spirit-groping were not theirs."
"“他们就像我说的一样，他们是为享乐而活的，不过他们得出了一个概念。该死的概念！他们玩弄逻辑，这就是他们的逻辑。——但是我先和你说说一天晚上我们的谈话吧。那是和戈蒂埃的马德琳·莫平的谈话。你记得那个少女吗？她接过一次吻，只有一次，然后就不肯再接吻。并不是她觉得亲吻不甜蜜，而是害怕亲吻过多会令人生厌。又是餍足！她尝试不下赌注和神来赌一把。这和神自己制定的游戏规则相反。只是规则并不贴在墙上广而告之。人类必须参与游戏，这样才能学习规则。","“They were all this that I have said, and they were made for joy, only they achieved a concept.A curse on concepts!They played with logic, and this was their logic.—But first let me tell you of a talk we had one night.It was of Gautier’s Madeline de Maupin.You remember the maid?She kissed once, and once only, and kisses she would have no more.Not that she found kisses were not sweet, but that she feared with repetition they would cloy.Satiety again!She tried to play without stakes against the gods.Now this is contrary to a rule of the game the gods themselves have made.Only the rules are not posted over the table.Mortals must play in order to learn the rules."
"“那么，说说逻辑。那个男人和那个女人这样争论道：为什么只接一次吻？如果只接一次吻是明智的话，从不接吻不是更明智吗？这样就能让爱情保鲜。禁欲反而能让心保持悸动。","“Well, to the logic.The man and the woman argued thus: Why kiss once only?If to kiss once were wise, was it not wiser to kiss not at all?Thus could they keep Love alive.Fasting, he would knock forever at their hearts."
"“他们得出这种罪恶的结论可能是遗传的缘故。有时候最荒诞的是这个种族会灭绝。因此他们咒骂阿尔比恩是个可耻的荡妇，一个厚颜无耻、会算计又狡猾的荡妇。毕竟我不太清楚。但我知道，正是出于无节制地享乐的目的，他们才放弃享乐。","“Perhaps it was out of their heredity that they achieved this unholy concept.The breed will out, and sometimes most fantastically.Thus in them did cursed Albion array herself a scheming wanton, a bold, cold-calculating, and artful hussy.After all, I do not know.But this I know: it was out of their inordinate desire for joy that they forewent joy."
"“就像他说的（这是很久之后，我在他给她的一封信里看到的）：‘把你抱在我的怀里，很近，但又不那么近。渴望得到你却不占有你，所以能一直拥有你。’她写道：‘因为你总在我恰好够不到的地方。一直想得到你但又从未得到过你，就这样永远持续下去，永远新鲜，永远都像第一次脸红那样兴奋。’","“As he said (I read it long afterward in one of his letters to her): ‘To hold you in my arms, close, and yet not close.To yearn for you, and never to have you, and so always to have you.’ And she: ‘For you to be always just beyond my reach.To be ever attaining you, and yet never attaining you, and for this to last forever, always fresh and new, and always with the first flush upon us.’"
"“他们并不是这么说的。他们爱的哲学从我口中说出已经是面目全非。我又有什么资格来探究他们的心灵世界？我是一只青蛙，在巨大黑暗的阴冷边缘，鼓着眼睛盯着这两个炽热心灵里的神秘与奇迹。","“That is not the way they said it.On my lips their love-philosophy is mangled.And who am I to delve into their soul-stuff?I am a frog, on the dank edge of a great darkness, gazing goggle-eyed at the mystery and wonder of their flaming souls."
"“目前来看，他们是对的。一切都很好……只要没有拥有爱。满足和拥有是死神的马，他们总是并驾齐驱。”","“And they were right, as far as they went.Everything is good… as long as it is unpossessed.Satiety and possession are Death’s horses; they run in span."
"“‘时间只教会我们用习惯发出的余辉来增加欣喜的温度。’","“‘And time could only tutor us to ekeOur rapture’s warmth with custom’s afterglow.’"
"“这是他们艾尔弗雷德·奥斯汀一首十四行诗里的诗行。这首诗叫做《爱的智慧》。诗里说的是马德琳·莫平的一吻。作者是怎么描述的呢？","“They got that from a sonnet of Alfred Austin’s.It was called ‘Love’s Wisdom.’ It was the one kiss of Madeline de Maupin.How did it run?"
"“‘我们吻一下，然后就分开，我们不能再更进一步；如果我们的爱会减少、从高潮到低谷，如果我们的爱会衰退、从坚强变得脆弱，那还不如死去。’","“‘Kiss we and part; no further can we go;And better death than we from high to lowShould dwindle, or decline from strong to weak.’"
"“但他们更明智。他们不会吻一下就分开。他们根本不亲吻，这样一来，他们期望能够停留在爱的顶点。他们结婚了。那时你在英格兰。从没有过这样的婚姻。他们保留着自己的秘诀。我那时并不知道。他们的欢喜狂热还没有冷却。他们的爱越来越炽热。从没有过这样的事。时间流逝，一个月又一个月，一年又一年，那以火焰为翼的弹琴人越来越光彩照人。","“But they were wiser.They would not kiss and part.They would not kiss at all, and thus they planned to stay at Love’s topmost peak.They married.You were in England at the time.And never was there such a marriage.They kept their secret to themselves.I did not know, then.Their rapture’s warmth did not cool.Their love burned with increasing brightness.Never was there anything like it.The time passed, the months, the years, and ever the flame-winged lute-player grew more resplendent."
"“所有人都感到惊讶。他们成为了完美爱人，羡煞旁人。有时候女人们可怜她没有孩子，这是女人表达嫉妒的方式。","“Everybody marvelled.They became the wonderful lovers, and they were greatly envied.Sometimes women pitied her because she was childless; it is the form the envy of such creatures takes."
"“我不知道他们的秘诀。我又是深思又是惊叹。一开始我曾预想，下意识地想象他们之间的爱会消逝。后来我注意到，消逝的是时间，留下来的是爱。所以我变得很好奇。他们的秘诀是什么呢？他们用什么样的魔法绑住了他们的爱？他们是如何抓住这个不通情理的小精灵的呢？他们和古时候的特里斯特拉姆和伊索尔特一样，喝了永葆爱情的神水？又是谁酿造的神水呢？","“And I did not know their secret.I pondered and I marvelled.As first I had expected, subconsciously I imagine, the passing of their love.Then I became aware that it was Time that passed and Love that remained.Then I became curious.What was their secret?What were the magic fetters with which they bound Love to them?How did they hold the graceless elf?What elixir of eternal love had they drunk together as had Tristram and Iseult of old time?And whose hand had brewed the fairy drink?"
"“正如我所说的，我很好奇，所以一直观察他们。他们爱得很疯狂。他们沉迷在爱的狂欢中。他们把爱变得盛大而隆重。他们沉浸在关于爱的艺术和诗歌中。不，他们没有得神经病。他们神智正常、身体健康，而且他们是艺术家。但他们做成了不可能完成的事情。他们获得了不灭的欲望。”","“As I say, I was curious, and I watched them.They were love-mad.They lived in an unending revel of Love.They made a pomp and ceremonial of it.They saturated themselves in the art and poetry of Love.No, they were not neurotics.They were sane and healthy, and they were artists.But they had accomplished the impossible.They had achieved deathless desire.”"
"“而我呢？我目睹了他们太多的事情，见证了他们永恒的爱的奇迹。我迷惑不解、感叹称奇，直到有一天——”","“And I?I saw much of them and their everlasting miracle of Love.I puzzled and wondered, and then one day—”"
"卡奎奈兹忽然停下来，问道：“你读过《爱的等待时光》吗？”","Carquinez broke off abruptly and asked, “Have you ever read, ‘Love’s Waiting Time’?”"
"我摇摇头。","I shook my head."
"“我想是佩奇写的——柯蒂斯·希登·佩奇。嗯，就是这一首小诗给了我线索。一天，在大钢琴旁窗户边上的座位上——你还记得她弹琴的样子么？她过去常常笑，有时候怀疑我是为他们来的还是为音乐来的。有一次她叫我‘音乐酒鬼’，一次还叫我‘贪图声音的家伙’。他的声音多美妙啊！听他唱歌的时候，我会相信有不朽存在，我会对神的态度几乎变成了屈尊俯就，我想出一定可以胜过他们和他们的把戏的办法。","“Page wrote it—Curtis Hidden Page, I think.Well, it was that bit of verse that gave me the clue.One day, in the window-seat near the big piano—you remember how she could play?She used to laugh, sometimes, and doubt whether it was for them I came, or for the music.She called me a ‘music-sot,’ once, a ‘sound-debauchee.’ What a voice he had!When he sang I believed in immortality, my regard for the gods grew almost patronizing, and I devised ways and means whereby I surely could outwit them and their tricks."
"“这是一副为神准备的景象，这对结婚数年的夫妻，唱着恋歌，歌里还蕴含着恋爱初时的清新，更有一种年轻恋人无法了解的成熟和热情。在这对相伴多年的夫妻面前，年轻的恋人都显得苍白而虚弱。看着他们，炽爱如火，柔情似水，保持着令人颤抖的距离，举手投足间，相顾无言时，秋波传送、轻声细语均为爱抚——他们的爱让他们彼此靠近，但他们又像振翅的飞蛾克制自己，彼此都是对方的烛火，还在惊人的飞行轨道上疯狂地绕着彼此旋转！似乎，遵循着某种伟大的物理规律，比重力更强大、更微妙的规律，在我眼前他们一定已经融为一体了。他们被称为完美爱人一点也不奇怪。","“It was a spectacle for God, that man and woman, years married, and singing love-songs with a freshness virginal as new-born Love himself, with a ripeness and wealth of ardor that young lovers can never know.Young lovers were pale and anaemic beside that long-married pair.To see them, all fire and flame and tenderness, at a trembling distance, lavishing caresses of eye and voice with every action, through every silence—their love driving them toward each other, and they withholding like fluttering moths, each to the other a candle-flame, and revolving each about the other in the mad gyrations of an amazing orbit-flight!It seemed, in obedience to some great law of physics, more potent than gravitation and more subtle, that they must corporeally melt each into each there before my very eyes.Small wonder they were called the wonderful lovers."
"“我跑题了。还是回到那首诗。一天我在窗户旁的座位上找到一本诗集。书自己翻开到《爱的等待时光》那页，显然有人经常看这篇。这一页已经因为翻阅得过多而变软，我读着：","“I have wandered.Now to the clue.One day in the window-seat I found a book of verse.It opened of itself, betraying long habit, to ‘Love’s Waiting Time.’ The page was thumbed and limp with overhandling, and there I read:—"
"“‘站在彼此身边是那么甜美，但还是要微微分开，为了更好地了解彼此，保持双方接触爱时那柔软而美好的感觉……哦，爱，还不是时候！……真甜蜜，让我们把爱在圣洁的神秘之中再包裹一会儿。等待未来的秘密，它还没来，时候还未到……某个时候……但还没到……","“‘So sweet it is to stand but just apart,To know each other better, and to keepThe soft, delicious sense of two that touch...O love, not yet!...Sweet, let us keep our loveWrapped round with sacred mystery awhile,Waiting the secret of the coming years,That come not yet, not yet...sometime...not yet..."
"哦，但就一小会儿我们的爱也许就会增长。","Oh, yet a little while our love may grow!"
"当爱全面盛开的时候，爱或许就会消亡。","When it has blossomed it will haply die."
"用无唇之吻养护它，让它安睡，躺在麻木的克制里，但不久……","Feed it with lipless kisses, let it sleep,Bedded in dead denial yet some while..."
"哦，但过一小会儿，过一小会儿。’","Oh, yet a little while, a little while.’"
"“我合上书，静静坐在那里，一动不动地呆了很久。这首诗向我传达出无比清晰的视野，我惊呆了。它是一种启发。它就像上帝照亮地狱的一道闪电。他们会保持住爱这个无常的小精灵，年轻生命的先行者——必须出生的年轻生命啊！","“I folded the book on my thumb and sat there silent and without moving for a long time.I was stunned by the clearness of vision the verse had imparted to me.It was illumination.It was like a bolt of God’s lightning in the Pit.They would keep Love, the fickle sprite, the forerunner of young life—young life that is imperative to be born!"
"“我脑子里反复回想着这几行诗——‘时候还未到，某个时候’——‘哦，爱，还不是时候’——‘用无唇之吻养护它，让它安睡。’我放声大笑，哈！哈！我明明白白地看清了他们无可指摘的心灵。他们是孩子。他们不懂。他们玩着自然之火，还躺在剑刃上。他们嘲笑神。他们要断绝宇宙的元气。他们发明了一个系统，然后把它放在人生的赌桌上，希望能赢。‘小心！’我大喊。‘神灵们就在桌后。他们为每个设计出来的系统制定新规则。你们不可能赢。’","“I conned the lines over in my mind—‘Not yet, sometime’—‘O Love, not yet’—‘Feed it with lipless kisses, let it sleep.’ And I laughed aloud, ha! ha!I saw with white vision their blameless souls.They were children.They did not understand.They played with Nature’s fire and bedded with a naked sword.They laughed at the gods.They would stop the cosmic sap.They had invented a system, and brought it to the gaming-table of life, and expected to win out.‘Beware!’ I cried.‘The gods are behind the table.They make new rules for every system that is devised.You have no chance to win.’"
"“但我没对他们这么喊。我等着。他们会明白他们的系统没有价值，然后把它扔掉。他们会满足于神给予的任何幸福，而不再奋力争取更多。","“But I did not so cry to them.I waited.They would learn that their system was worthless and throw it away.They would be content with whatever happiness the gods gave them and not strive to wrest more away."
"“我看着。我什么也没说。一个月又一个月过去了，他们对爱的渴望更加强烈。他们也从不把爱锁起让爱无趣。他们把爱建立在自我克制上，又用它把爱磨尖，而爱却变得越来越热烈。这种爱继续着，直到我也开始怀疑。神睡觉吗？我想知道。或者他们是死了吗？我笑我自己。这对男女创造了奇迹。他们依靠智慧胜过了上帝。他们让肉体自惭形秽，让和蔼的大地母亲面露不快。他们和大地玩火却没被烧到。他们不受影响。他们自己就是神，能辨善恶，明是非。‘这就是成为神的方法吗？’我问自己。‘我是只青蛙，’我说，‘如果不是我的眼里有泥，我本来会被我目睹的这个奇迹的耀眼光芒弄得眼花缭乱的。我仗着自己的智慧洋洋得意，对神妄加判断。’","“I watched.I said nothing.The months continued to come and go, and still the famine-edge of their love grew the sharper.Never did they dull it with a permitted love-clasp.They ground and whetted it on self-denial, and sharper and sharper it grew.This went on until even I doubted.Did the gods sleep?I wondered.Or were they dead?I laughed to myself.The man and the woman had made a miracle.They had outwitted God.They had shamed the flesh, and blackened the face of the good Earth Mother.They had played with her fire and not been burned.They were immune.They were themselves gods, knowing good from evil and tasting not.‘Was this the way gods came to be?’ I asked myself.‘I am a frog,’ I said.‘But for my mud-ridded eyes I should have been blinded by the brightness of this wonder I have witnessed.I have puffed myself up with my wisdom and passed judgment upon gods.’"
"“但即使这样，在我现在这种智力状态下，我还是错了。他们并不是神。他们是男人和女人——充满着欲望、会叹气、会激动的软黏土，他们有神没有的奇怪的弱点。","“Yet even in this, my latest wisdom, I was wrong.They were not gods.They were man and woman—soft clay that sighed and thrilled shot through with desire, thumbed with strange weaknesses which the gods have not.”"
"卡奎奈兹停了下来，开始卷另一支烟，还放声大笑，笑声很刺耳。他笑得一点也不好看，更像是魔鬼的嘲笑，笑声越来越大，盖住了暴风雨的怒吼，因而外面的嘈杂声变得含糊不清。","Carquinez broke from his narrative to roll another cigarette and to laugh harshly.It was not a pretty laugh; it was like the mockery of a devil, and it rose over and rode the roar of the storm that came muffled to our ears from the crashing outside world."
"“我是只青蛙，”他抱歉地说。“他们怎么能理解呢？”“他们是艺术家，不是生物学家。”他们知道工作室里的黏土，但他们却不知道自己是什么样的黏土造的。可是我要说——他们玩得太过了。以前从没有过这样的游戏，我怀疑以后也不会有这样的游戏。","“I am a frog,” he said apologetically.“How were they to understand?They were artists, not biologists.They knew the clay of the studio, but they did not know the clay of which they themselves were made.But this I will say—they played high.Never was there such a game before, and I doubt me if there will ever be such a game again."
"“从没有恋人像他们这样忘形。他们没用亲吻杀死爱。他们用克制刺激着爱。因为克制，他们让爱充满欲望。那个以火为翼的弹琴人用自己温暖的翅膀给他们扇风，直到他们神魂颠倒。这是爱的谵妄，周驰月遁，他们的爱丝毫没有消减，反而越来越浓厚。","“Never was lovers’ ecstasy like theirs.They had not killed Love with kisses.They had quickened him with denial.And by denial they drove him on till he was all aburst with desire.And the flame-winged luteplayer fanned them with his warm wings till they were all but swooning.It was the very delirium of Love, and it continued undiminished and increasing through the weeks and months."
"“他们渴望着、向往着，经受着爱所有痴情的苦闷和甜蜜的痛苦，他们的渴望是如此的强烈，简直是前无古人，后无来者。","“They longed and yearned, with all the fond pangs and sweet delicious agonies, with an intensity never felt by lovers before nor since."
"“一天，昏睡的神明终于不再打瞌睡了。他们醒来看着这对嘲弄他们的男女。一天早晨，这对夫妻相互对视，明白有些东西已经不复存在。就是那个挥着火焰翅膀的人。夜里他从修道院的木板上悄悄地飞走了。","“And then one day the drowsy gods ceased nodding.They aroused and looked at the man and woman who had made a mock of them.And the man and woman looked into each other’s eyes one morning and knew that something was gone.It was the flame-winged one.He had fled, silently, in the night, from their anchorites’ board."
"“他们彼此对视，知道对方并不在乎。欲望已死。你明白么？欲望已死。而他们从未吻过对方。一次都没有。爱已成往事。他们的内心不会再渴望、再燃烧。对他们来说一切都结束了——再也没有战栗和颤抖，再也没有美妙的苦痛，再也没有悸动和心动，再也没有叹息和歌声。欲望熄灭了。夜里，爱孤单地躺在一张冰冷的床上，死去了；他们并没有亲眼看到爱离去。他们从彼此的眼神中第一次明白了这个事实。","“They looked into each other’s eyes and knew that they did not care.Desire was dead.Do you understand?Desire was dead.And they had never kissed.Not once had they kissed.Love was gone.They would never yearn and burn again.For them there was nothing left—no more tremblings and flutterings and delicious anguishes, no more throbbing and pulsing, and sighing and song.Desire was dead.It had died in the night, on a couch cold and unattended; nor had they witnessed its passing.They learned it for the first time in each other’s eyes."
"“神可能不很友善，但却还算仁慈。他们旋转着小象牙球，收走了桌上的赌注。最后，只有这对男女互相盯着对方冰冷的眼眸。然后他死了。这就是神的慈悲。那周还没结束，马文·菲斯克就去世了——你还记得那个意外吧。过了很久，在她那段时间记的日记里，我看到她引用米切尔·肯纳利的话：——","“The gods may not be kind, but they are often merciful.They had twirled the little ivory ball and swept the stakes from the table.All that remained was the man and woman gazing into each other’s cold eyes.And then he died.That was the mercy.Within the week Marvin Fiske was dead—you remember the accident.And in her diary, written at this time, I long afterward read Mitchell Kennerly’s:—"
"‘能亲吻的每一刻，我们的双唇都贴在一起’","‘There was not a single hour we might have kissed and did not kiss.’"
"“哦，真是讽刺！”我大叫。","“Oh, the irony of it!” I cried out."
"卡奎奈兹穿着天鹅绒大衣，在火光的映衬下简直就是魔鬼，他用他黑色的眼珠直勾勾地盯着我。","And Carquinez, in the firelight a veritable Mephistopheles in velvet jacket, fixed me with his black eyes."
"“你说，他们赢了？世人的判断！我告诉过你，而且我知道。他们的胜利和你在这丘陵里的胜利别无二致。","“And they won, you said?The world’s judgment!I have told you, and I know.They won as you are winning, here in your hills.”"
"“但是你，”我生气地质问他，“你纵情享乐，沉溺于声色犬马之中——你以为自己赢了么？”","“But you,” I demanded hotly; “you with your orgies of sound and sense, with your mad cities and madder frolics—bethink you that you win?”"
"他缓缓地摇了摇头。“因为你和你清醒的乡野生活输了，所以我也没有理由赢。我们从来不会赢。有时候我们认为我们赢了。这是众神开的小玩笑。”","He shook his head slowly.“Because you, with your sober bucolic regime, lose, is no reason that I should win.We never win.Sometimes we think we win.That is a little pleasantry of the gods.”"
