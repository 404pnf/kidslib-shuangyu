		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果说有什么最让他讨厌的事的话，那就是她早晨叫醒他的方式了。当然，她是故意那样做的。那是她发泄当天不满的惯用做法，他才不会让她看出这招有多管用呢！不过说实话，叫醒一个像他那样敏感的人的确是很危险啊！他得需要好几个小时才能醒过神来——真得好几个小时。她扣紧罩衣走进房间，头上还系着一条手绢，以此来证明她自己天刚亮时就起床了，一直像奴隶一样忙到现在。她用一种警告的口气小声喊道：“雷金纳德！”</td>
		<td class="en">If there was one thing that he hated more than another, it was the way she had of waking him in the morning.She did it on purpose, of course.It was her way of establishing her grievance for the day, and he was not going to let her know how successful it was.But really, really, to wake a sensitive person like that was positively dangerous!It took him hours to get over it—simply hours.She came into the room buttoned up in an overall, with a handkerchief over her head—thereby proving that she had been up herself and slaving since dawn—and called in a low, warning voice: “Reginald!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯！干什么！怎么了?出什么事了？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Eh!What!What’s that?What’s the matter?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“该起床了，已经八点半了。”她说完走出了房间，轻轻带上了房门，他猜想，没准她正在为自己的成功得意呢。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s time to get up; it’s half past eight.”And out she went, shutting the door quietly after her, to gloat over her triumph, he supposed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在他的大床上翻腾着，他的心在沉闷地怦怦悸动着，每跳一下他都感觉到精力在离他而去，他的???????——他的一天的灵感正在这悸动下窒息着。似乎她通过剥夺他成为艺术家的权利，把他降低到她自己的那个层次，幸灾乐祸地让他过上比原本更艰难的生活——天知道原本的生活应该是怎样的。她怎么了？她到底想要什么？他现在的学生数量不已经是他们结婚时的三倍了吗？他的收入也是当初的三倍，他们拥有的每一件家当都是他付的钱，而且他已经开始为阿德里安支付上幼儿园的费用了……何况他什么时候责怪过她一分钱都没赚过？从来没说过——也从来没有流露过！事实就是一旦你娶了个老婆，她就会变得无法满足，还有就是对于一个艺术家来说没有什么比结婚更致命的了，除非是上了四十岁，不然无论如何都是如此。他为什么要和她结婚呢?他平均一天要问自己三次这个问题，可是他从来没有找到满意的答案。她是在他意志薄弱的时候把他抓到手的，当时他涉世不深，一时间还迷迷茫茫不知所措。回首往事，他看到了一个让人感到悲哀的年轻的生命，一半像个孩子，一半又像只没有被驯服的野鸟，完全没有能力应对账单和债主们以及所有生活中令人讨厌的琐事。唉——如果能让她有丝毫满足的话，她就会使出浑身解数来剪断他的翅膀。她可以为自己大清早小伎俩的成功庆祝一番了。一个人醒来的时候应该是美滋滋的而且不太情愿的，他一边想着，一边从暖乎乎的床上下了地。他开始想象着一连串让人着迷的场景，最后的情景是他刚收的一个很迷人的学生用她赤裸的、带有香味的胳膊搂着他的脖子，她那长长的、散发着香气的秀发披垂在他的身上。“醒醒，亲爱的！”……</td>
		<td class="en">He rolled over in the big bed, his heart still beating in quick, dull throbs, and with every throb he felt his energy escaping him, his—his inspiration for the day stifling under those thudding blows.It seemed that she took a malicious delight in making life more difficult for him than—Heaven knows—it was, by denying him his rights as an artist, by trying to drag him down to her level.What was the matter with her?What the hell did she want?Hadn’t he have three times as many pupils now as when they were first married, earned three times as much, paid for every stick and stone that they possessed, and now had begun to shell out for Adrian’s kindergarten?...And had he ever reproached her for not having a penny to her name?Never a word—never a sign!The truth was that once you married a woman she became insatiable, and the truth was that nothing was more fatal for an artist than marriage, at any rate until he was well over forty....Why had he married her?He asked himself this question on an average about three times a day, but he never could answer it satisfactorily.She had caught him at a weak moment, when the first plunge into reality had bewildered and overwhelmed him for a time.Looking back, he saw a pathetic, youthful creature, half child, half wild untamed bird, totally incompetent to cope with bills and creditors and all the sordid details of existence.Well—she had done her best to clip his wings, if that was any satisfaction for her, and she could congratulate herself on the success of this early morning trick.One ought to wake exquisitely, reluctantly, he thought, slipping down in the warm bed.He began to imagine a series of enchanting scenes which ended with his latest, most charming pupil putting her bare, scented arms around his neck, and covering him with her long, perfumed hair.“Awake, my love!”...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每天当雷金纳德放洗澡水的时候，他都习惯性地练练嗓子。</td>
		<td class="en">As was his daily habit, while the bath water ran, Reginald Peacock tried his voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每当她母亲在笑着的镜前打扮，系好丝带，绾好发髻，他唱歌的时候，先是轻声唱，听听音质，练练嗓子，直到他唱到第三句：</td>
		<td class="en">When her mother tends her before the laughing mirror, looping up her laces, tying up her hair, he sang, softly at first, listening to the quality, nursing his voice until he came to the third line:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她常常想，要是这个野东西结了婚……</td>
		<td class="en">Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每当唱到“结了婚”这几个字，他都会爆发出胜利的欢呼，震得浴室架子上的刷牙杯直抖，甚至洗澡喷头都好像要下暴雨一样喷出水来表示喝彩。</td>
		<td class="en">and upon the word “wedded” he burst into such a shout of triumph that the tooth-glass on the bathroom shelf trembled and even the bath tap seemed to gush stormy applause.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不错，嗓子没问题，他边想着边跳进浴缸，用一条鱼状的丝瓜络在他柔软粉红的身上涂抹上了香皂。他唱这首歌一定能让科文特花园爆满！“结婚了” ，他又一次高声唱道，摆出一副神气的唱歌剧的姿势，抓起毛巾，一边擦身子一边继续唱着歌，好像他就是被天鹅不小心翻到水里的罗英格林，他得在讨厌的埃尔莎到来之前赶紧把身子擦干……</td>
		<td class="en">Well, there was nothing wrong with his voice, he thought, leaping into the bath and soaping his soft, pink body all over with a loofah shaped like a fish.He could fill Covent Garden with it!“Wedded,” he shouted again, seizing the towel with a magnificent operatic gesture, and went on singing while he rubbed as though he had been Lohengrin tipped out by an unwary Swan and drying himself in the greatest haste before that tiresome Elsa came along along...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >回到卧室后他飞快地卷起窗帘，太阳光照在地毯上，就像一张乳黄色的吸墨纸，他站在这块淡淡的光影之上开始健身了——深呼吸，弯弯腰，仰仰身，像青蛙一样半蹲，然后再伸伸腿——因为要说有哪件事能让他害怕，那就是发胖，更何况干他这一行的都有发胖的可怕趋势。不过眼下他还没有发胖的迹象。他认为自己的身材刚刚好，很匀称。其实啊，每当看到镜子里的自己，身着晨礼服、深灰色裤子、灰色袜子，打着带银线的黑色领带，他都会情不自禁地感到满足。这倒不是因为他爱慕虚荣——他受不了爱慕虚荣的男人——真受不了；看着自己他有一种纯艺术性的满足。“就是好啊！”他说着用一只手捋了下他那光滑锃亮的头发。</td>
		<td class="en">Back in his bedroom, he pulled the blind up with a jerk, and standing upon the pale square of sunlight that lay upon the carpet like a sheet of cream blotting-paper, he began to do his exercises—deep breathing, bending forward and back, squatting like a frog and shooting out his legs—for if there was one thing he had a horror of it was of getting fat, and men in his profession had a dreadful tendency that way.However, there was no sign of it at present.He was, he decided, just right, just in good proportion.In fact, he could not help a thrill of satisfaction when he saw himself in the glass, dressed in a morning coat, dark grey trousers, grey socks, and a black tie with a silver thread in it.Not that he was vain—he couldn’t stand vain men—no; the sight of himself gave him a thrill of purely artistic satisfaction.“Voilá tout!” said he, passing his hand over his sleek hair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那句简单的法语就像一喷烟一样轻盈地从他嘴里脱口而出，这让他想起前一天晚上又有人问他是不是英国人。人们似乎很难相信他没有南欧人的血统。的确，他唱歌时那富于感染力的音质丝毫没有英国人的迹象……门把手咯咯响，转动了一下又一下。阿德里安的头伸了进来。</td>
		<td class="en">That little, easy French phrase, blown so lightly from his lips like a whiff of smoke, reminded him that someone had asked him again, the evening before, if he was English.People seemed to find it impossible to believe that he hadn’t some Southern blood.True, there was an emotional quality in his singing that had nothing of the John Bull in it....The door-handle rattled and turned round and round.Adrian’s head popped through.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“爸爸，妈妈说早餐已经准备好了，您请吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Please, father, mother says breakfast is quite ready, please.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好的。”　雷金纳德说。然后，阿德里安刚要离开，他又喊道：“阿德里安！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Very well,” said Reginald.Then, just as Adrian disappeared: “Adrian!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，爸爸。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, father.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你还没跟我说‘早上好’呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You haven’t said ‘good morning.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几个月前，雷金纳德曾经在一个贵族家庭里过周末，那家的爸爸早晨接待小儿子们的时候还和他们握手呢。雷金纳德认为这么做很有魅力，他想马上在家里推行这种做法，可是阿德里安感觉每天早晨都和自己的爸爸握手真是太无聊了。爸爸为什么总是对着他唱歌而不跟他说话呢……</td>
		<td class="en">A few months ago Reginald had spent a weekend in a very aristocratic family, where the father received his little sons in the morning and shook hands with them.Reginald thought the practice charming, and introduced it immediately, but Adrian felt dreadfully silly at having to shake hands with his own father every morning.And why did his father always sort of sing to him instead of talk?...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >雷金纳德心情特好，他走进餐厅坐了下来，在他面前摆放着一摞信件、一份《泰晤士报》和一个盖着的小盘子。他瞥了一眼那些信件，然后又看了看他的早餐。两片薄薄的熏肉和一个鸡蛋。</td>
		<td class="en">In excellent temper, Reginald walked into the dining-room and sat down before a pile of letters, a copy of the Times, and a little covered dish.He glanced at the letters and then at his breakfast.There were two thin slices of bacon and one egg.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不想要点熏肉吗?”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t you want any bacon?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不想，我宁愿吃个凉的烤苹果。我觉得没必要每天早上吃熏肉。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, I prefer a cold baked apple.I don’t feel the need of bacon every morning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，她的意思是不是说他也没有必要每天早晨吃熏肉，是不是说她厌烦了不得不给他做熏肉呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Now, did she mean that there was no need for him to have bacon every morning, either, and that she grudged having to cook it for him?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果你不想做早餐，”他说，“为什么不雇个佣人呢？你知道我们雇得起佣人，而且你也知道我讨厌看到我老婆干这些活儿。仅仅因为我们过去雇的佣人都不理想，完全搅乱了我的饮食起居，让我几乎没法在家里教学生，所以你就放弃了去试着找个合适的女佣。培训一个佣人不是不可能的，不是吗？我的意思是说，这并不需要天资出众吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“If you don’t want to cook the breakfast,” said he, “why don’t you keep a servant?You know we can afford one, and you know how I loathe to see my wife doing the work.Simply because all the women we have had in the past have been failures, and utterly upset my regime, and made it almost impossible for me to have any pupils here, you’ve given up trying to find a decent woman.It’s not impossible to train a servant—is it?I mean, it doesn’t require genius?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可我宁愿自己做；这样生活就平静多了……快点，阿德里安，宝贝儿子，准备上学了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But I prefer to do the work myself; it makes life so much more peaceful....Run along, Adrian darling, and get ready for school.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，不，不嘛！”雷金纳德假装笑了笑。“你自己做家务，一个特别的原因无外乎是你喜欢让我丢脸。客观上，你也许没有意识到这一点，可是，主观上，事实就是这样。”最后这句话让他如此开心，以至于他很优雅地打开了一个信封，仿佛自己置身在舞台上……</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh no, that’s not it!”Reginald pretended to smile.“You do the work yourself, because, for some extraordinary reason, you love to humiliate me.Objectively, you may not know that, but, subjectively, it’s the case.”This last remark so delighted him that he cut open an envelope as gracefully as if he had been on the stage....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的皮科克先生:</td>
		<td class="en">“DEAR MR. PEACOCK,</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >您今晚的歌唱给我带来了极大的乐趣，我觉得我必须再一次向您表示感谢，否则我会无法入睡的。真是令人难忘啊！您让我好奇地想要知道，而这也是我从小以来第一次这样好奇地想要知道，是否这就是一切。我的意思是说，是否这平凡的世界就是一切。也许，对于我们这些能够理解的人来说，如果我们有勇气去正视至善至美的话，它是否就在等着我们。而且把它变成我们自己的……房子里是如此地安静。我希望您此时此刻就在这里，那我也好当面向您表示感谢。您正在成就一件伟大的事情。您在教世人摆脱人生的烦恼！</td>
		<td class="en">I feel I cannot go to sleep until I have thanked you again for the wonderful joy your singing gave me this evening.Quite unforgettable.You make me wonder, as I have not wondered since I was a girl, if this is all.I mean, if this ordinary world is all.If there is not, perhaps, for those of us who understand, divine beauty and richness awaiting us if we only have the courage to see it.And to make it ours... The house is so quiet.I wish you were here now that I might thank you in person.You are doing a great thing.You are teaching the world to escape from life!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >您最诚挚的，</td>
		<td class="en">Yours, most sincerely,</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伊奥妮·费尔</td>
		<td class="en">ÆNONE FELL.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >附言：这星期我每天下午都在家……”</td>
		<td class="en">P.S.—I am in every afternoon this week....”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这封信是用紫色墨水在很厚的手工制的纸上涂写的。虚荣心，那只欢快的小鸟，又开始拍打它的翅膀了，一直拍啊拍，直到他感觉胸口就要裂开了才停了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">The letter was scrawled in violet ink on thick, handmade paper.Vanity, that bright bird, lifted its wings again, lifted them until he felt his breast would break.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好了，咱们不要再吵了。”他说道，而且竟然还兴冲冲地朝他妻子伸过去一只手。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh well, don’t let us quarrel,” said he, and actually flung out a hand to his wife.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是她却不够大度，居然没什么反应。</td>
		<td class="en">But she was not great enough to respond.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我得赶紧送阿德里安去上学了，”她说。“你的房间已经都收拾好了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I must hurry and take Adrian to school,” said she.“Your room is quite ready for you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好吧——好吧——那就让我们俩公开吵一架吧！不过他就是被吊死也不会再主动跟她和好了！</td>
		<td class="en">Very well—very well—let there be open war between us!But he was hanged if he’d be the first to make it up again!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在自己的房间里走来走去，直到听见他妻子和阿德里安离开后关上大门的声音，他才再次平静下来。当然，如果继续这样下去的话，他得做其他安排了。那是明摆着的。像这样被捆绑和束缚着，他又怎能帮助世人摆脱人生的烦恼呢？他打开钢琴，查看了一下今天上午都有哪几个学生来上课。有贝蒂·布里特尔小姐，威科夫斯卡伯爵小姐和玛丽安·莫罗小姐。她们很娇媚迷人，三个都是如此。</td>
		<td class="en">He walked up and down his room, and was not calm again until he heard the outer door close upon Adrian and his wife.Of course, if this went on, he would have to make some other arrangement.That was obvious.Tied and bound like this, how could he help the world to escape from life?He opened the piano and looked up his pupils for the morning.Miss Betty Brittle, the Countess Wilkowska, and Miss Marian Morrow.They were charming, all three.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >十点半，门铃声准时响起。他前去开门。贝蒂·布里特尔小姐站在门口，身穿白色衣服，手里拿着蓝丝绸的乐谱夹。</td>
		<td class="en">Punctually at half past ten the door-bell rang.He went to the door.Miss Betty Brittle was there, dressed in white, with her music in a blue silk case.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“恐怕我来早了吧。”她说，害羞得脸都红了，她的蓝眼睛睁得大大的。“我来早了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m afraid I’m early,” she said, blushing and shy, and she opened her big blue eyes very wide.“Am I?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一点儿也不早，亲爱的小姐。我真是太高兴了，”雷金纳德说。“快进来吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not at all, dear lady.I am only too charmed,” said Reginald.“Won’t you come in?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真是个美好的早晨。”布里特尔小姐说。“我从公园里穿过。那里的花儿开得美极了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s such a heavenly morning,” said Miss Brittle.“I walked across the park.The flowers were too marvellous.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那好，你练习唱歌的时候就想想那些花吧，”　雷金纳德说着在钢琴前面坐了下来。“这会让你的声音生动又热情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, think about them while you sing your exercises,” said Reginald, sitting down at the piano.“It will give your voice colour and warmth.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，真是个好主意啊！您可真是个天才，皮科克先生。”她张开美丽的双唇，像朵紫罗兰一样唱了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Oh, what an enchanting idea!What a genius Mr. Peacock was.She parted her pretty lips, and began to sing like a pansy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很好，很好，的确很好，”雷金纳德一面说，一面弹着和弦，悠扬的琴声能把一个顽固的罪犯飘送到天堂去。“音符要唱得圆润点。不用害怕。在音符上逗留把玩，让它们就像香水一样通气透香。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Very good, very good, indeed,” said Reginald, playing chords that would waft a hardened criminal to heaven.“Make the notes round.Don’t be afraid.Linger over them, breathe them like a perfume.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她看起来多么漂亮，身着白色连衣裙站在那里，满头金发的小脑袋歪向一边，露出她乳白色的喉部。</td>
		<td class="en">How pretty she looked, standing there in her white frock, her little blonde head tilted, showing her milky throat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在镜子前练习过吗？”雷金纳德问道。“你知道你应该那样练习的，这会让你的双唇更灵活。到这儿来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you ever practise before a glass?” asked Reginald.“You ought to, you know; it makes the lips more flexible.Come over here.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们走到镜子前，并排站在那里。</td>
		<td class="en">They went over to the mirror and stood side by side.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好，唱——莫——厄——科——厄——乌——厄——啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now sing—moo—e—koo—e—oo—e—a!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是她突然停了下来，脸蛋比原先红得更加艳丽了。“哎呀，”她叫道，“我唱不了。这让我感觉很傻。让我想笑。我真的看起来很可笑！”</td>
		<td class="en">But she broke down, and blushed more brightly than ever.“Oh,” she cried, “I can’t.It makes me feel so silly.It makes me want to laugh.I do look so absurd!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，不会的。别害怕。”雷金纳德说，可他也忍不住亲切地笑了。“好了，再试一次！”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, you don’t.Don’t be afraid,” said Reginald, but laughed, too, very kindly.“Now, try again!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这节课时间过得很快，贝蒂·布莱特尔完全战胜了自己的害羞心理。</td>
		<td class="en">The lesson simply flew, and Betty Brittle quite got over her shyness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我什么时候能再来啊？”她问道，同时把她的乐谱重新放回到蓝色丝绸夹里。“我想像现在这样尽可能多地上课。哦，皮科克先生，我真喜欢上您的课。我可以后天来吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“When can I come again?” she asked, tying the music up again in the blue silk case.“I want to take as many lessons as I can just now.Oh, Mr. Peacock, I do enjoy them so much.May I come the day after tomorrow?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的小姐，这样的话，我真是太高兴了。”雷金纳德说着起身把她送了出去。</td>
		<td class="en">“Dear lady, I shall be only too charmed,” said Reginald, bowing her out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好一个漂亮的小姑娘！当他们并排站在镜子前时，她那白色衣袖刚好碰触到他黑色的衣袖。他能够感觉到——是的，他真的能够感觉到一个暖暖的发热的地方，他摸了摸那个地方。她喜欢她的课程。这时他妻子走了进来。</td>
		<td class="en">Glorious girl!And when they had stood in front of the mirror, her white sleeve had just touched his black one.He could feel—yes, he could actually feel a warm glowing spot, and he stroked it.She loved her lessons.His wife came in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“雷金纳德，能给我点钱吗？我得交买牛奶的钱了。还有，你今晚在家吃饭吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Reginald, can you let me have some money?I must pay the dairy.And will you be in for dinner tonight?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在家，你知道我九点半要在廷巴克勋爵府上唱歌。给我做个清淡点的汤，里面打个鸡蛋好吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, you know I’m singing at Lord Timbuck’s at half past nine.Can you make me some clear soup, with an egg in it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好的。钱呢，雷金纳德。总共是八先令六便士。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes.And the money, Reginald.It’s eight and sixpence.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还真是挺多的——不是吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Surely that’s very heavy—isn’t it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，应该就是这么多。况且阿德里安必须得喝牛奶。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, it’s just what it ought to be.And Adrian must have milk.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瞧她——又把话岔开了。这回她搬出阿德里安来和他作对。</td>
		<td class="en">There she was—off again.Now she was standing up for Adrian against him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我压根也没想不让孩子适量地喝些牛奶。”雷金纳德说，“给你十先令。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎呀，”威科夫斯卡伯爵小姐说，“这楼梯，我都喘不过气来了。”她一路把手放在心口上，跟着他进了音乐室。她穿着一身黑色衣服，戴着一顶有漂浮面纱的小黑帽——胸前戴了朵紫罗兰。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh,” said the Countess Wilkowska, “the stairs.I have not a breath.”And she put her hand over her heart as she followed him into the music-room.She was all in black, with a little black hat with a floating veil-violets in her bosom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今天别让我做视唱练习了，”她叫道，用她那种可爱又带有异域风情的方式摆了摆手。“不做练习了，今天，我只想唱歌……我可以摘下我的紫罗兰吗?它们凋谢得太快了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do not make me sing exercises, today,” she cried, throwing out her hands in her delightful foreign way.“No, today, I want only to sing songs....And may I take off my violets?They fade so soon.”</td></tr>
