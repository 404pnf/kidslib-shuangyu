"给小女孩的忠告","Advice to Little Girls"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"好女孩不应该因受到老师的一点轻微批评就朝老师撅起小嘴、扮鬼脸。只有在批评过分的情况下才能使用这种报复手段。","Good little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers for every trifling offense.This retaliation should only be resorted to under peculiarly aggravated circumstances."
"如果你只有一个用锯末填充的布娃娃，而你的一个小伙伴却有个贵重的瓷娃娃。尽管她的家庭条件比你好，你还是要对她表示友善。即使你知道你能强行与她手中的娃娃进行交换，你也不应该企图这样去做，因为这会使你的良心受到谴责。","If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, while one of your more fortunate little playmates has a costly China one, you should treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless.And you ought not to attempt to make a forcible swap with her unless your conscience would justify you in it, and you know you are able to do it."
"你也绝不能野蛮地抢走你弟弟的“口香糖”；更好的方式是想办法哄哄他。你可以先答应他，下次要是在河礁上捡到漂来的两块五美元，一定给他。在他那个简单纯真的年龄，他会觉得这是一桩相当公平的交易。从古到今，这个狡猾高明的伎俩骗得多少懵懂的小家伙倾家荡产。","You ought never to take your little brother’s “chewing-gum” away from him by main force; it is better to rope him in with the promise of the first two dollars and a half you find floating down the river on a grindstone.In the artless simplicity natural to this time of life, he will regard it as a perfectly fair transaction.In all ages of the world this eminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant to financial ruin and disaster."
"任何时候你觉得需要纠正弟弟的不良习性了，都不要通过朝他扔泥巴来纠正他——无论如何不要那么做，那会弄脏他的衣服。烫他一下也许更管用，因为你能得到满意的效果。你既能确保他的注意力马上转移到你苦口婆心的教育上，同时也顺便把他身上的污垢洗掉，只是他可能会被烫破点皮。","If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother, do not correct him with mud—never, on any account, throw mud at him, because it will spoil his clothes.It is better to scald him a little, for then you obtain desirable results.You secure his immediate attention to the lessons you are inculcating, and at the same time your hot water will have a tendency to move impurities from his person, and possibly the skin, in spots."
"要是你妈妈让你去做什么事情，你可不能说你不去。更恰当的做法是你先答应一定按她吩咐的去做，之后你便不动声色，完全自己看着办。","If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to reply that you won’t.It is better and more becoming to intimate that you will do as she bids you, and then afterward act quietly in the matter according to the dictates of your best judgment."
"你应该永远牢记在心：你要感恩和体贴你慈祥的父母，是他们把你养大，是他们在你装病逃学时，特许你呆在家里好好休息。所以你要尊重他们一些小的成见，迁就他们突发奇想的念头，容忍他们身上的小缺点，除非他们对你施加过大的压力。","You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parents that you are indebted for your food, and for the privilege of staying home from school when you let on that you are sick.Therefore you ought to respect their little prejudices, and humor their little whims, and put up with their little foibles until they get to crowding you too much."
"好女孩总是在长辈面前特别听话。你绝不该顶撞长辈，除非他们事先对你出言无理。","Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged.You ought never to “sass” old people unless they “sass” you first."
