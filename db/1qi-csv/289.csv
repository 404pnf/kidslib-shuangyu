"她长着很大却很好看的鹰钩鼻。淡淡的汗毛罩着上唇，可是脸上肤色匀净，皮肤光滑，像象牙，又像乳白色的琥珀。那一头波浪般闪着微光的头发，就像皮蒂画院里阿洛里的《犹滴》。尤其是那双深灰色的美丽眼睛，眸子周边一道黑圈，即使是在恐惧和悲伤让眸子暗淡的此刻，仍带着洋洋得意的眼神……萨宁的思绪不禁飞向了他刚刚离开的那个非凡的国度……可在意大利，他也没见过像她这么漂亮的姑娘！姑娘的呼吸缓慢而不均匀，好像每次呼吸之间都在等着看他弟弟有没有缓过气来。","Her nose was rather large, but handsome, aquiline-shaped; her upper lip was shaded by a light down; but then the colour of her face, smooth, uniform, like ivory or very pale milky amber, the wavering shimmer of her hair, like that of the Judith of Allorio in the Palazzo Pitti; and above all, her eyes, dark-grey, with a black ring round the pupils, splendid, triumphant eyes, even now, when terror and distress dimmed their lustre...Sanin could not help recalling the marvellous country he had just come from...But even in Italy he had never met anything like her!The girl drew slow, uneven breaths; she seemed between each breath to be waiting to see whether her brother would not begin to breathe."
