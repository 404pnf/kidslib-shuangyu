		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >某人不得不自食其言了。我记得自己过去常常声称，或许还写下来过：“一切有可能画的都被画过了，一切有可能用在画布上的画笔的笔触都被用过了。视觉艺术已经走到了死胡同。”然后，四十岁的我突然开始画画，而且还入了迷。</td>
		<td class="en">One has to eat one’s own words.I remember I used to assert, perhaps I even wrote it: “Everything that can possibly be painted has been painted, every brush-stroke that can possibly be laid on canvas has been laid on.The visual arts are at a dead end.”Then suddenly at the age of forty, I begin painting myself and am fascinated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过今年，徜徉在巴黎的画廊里时，我看到了杜飞和基里科等人的画作，还有日本画家伊藤的空洞的裸体画——画里的人物都有着珍珠扣似的双眼，这些都让我感到疲倦。他们都是会在未来有所作为的画家，也都在为此而努力。他们至少没有什么可画的了。在他们的画作当中，弗里叶兹画的典雅的花，或洛朗森在吸墨纸上画的画，似乎称得上是杰作。画里至少还体现了一点儿绘画中的自然表现手法。虽然与那些大画家相比实在不足道，但就其本身而言，仍然极为真实。</td>
		<td class="en">Still, going through the Paris picture shops this year of grace, and seeing the Dufys and Chiricos, etc., and the Japanese Ito with hi wish-wash nudes with pearl-button eyes, the same weariness comes over one.They are all so would-be, they make such efforts.They at least have nothing to paint.In the midst of them a graceful Friesz flower-piece, or a blotting-paper Laurencin, seems a masterpiece.At least here is a bit of natural expression in paint.Trivial enough, when compared to the big painters, but still, as far as they go, real.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，我是怎么回事！我突然开始画画，我到底在干什么？我是一个作家，我应该坚持写作。我已经找到了表达方式，为什么还会在四十岁时突然想尝试另一种方式呢？</td>
		<td class="en">What about myself, then!What am I doing, bursting into paint?I am a writer, I ought to stick to ink.I have found my medium of expression; why, at the age of forty, should I suddenly want to try another?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >事情发生了，我们别无选择。如果玛丽亚·赫胥黎没有乘车来到我们靠近佛罗伦萨的房子，没有给我带来她家中已经丢弃的四块相当大的画布（其中一块还被她弄破了），我可能这辈子也不会开始画一幅真正的画。但那些画布绷得很好，实在是太诱人了。我们曾漆过房子里的门和窗框，所以还留有一点儿油料、松节油和颜料粉，有些是从一个意大利杂货店买来的。还有几把漆房子用的刷子。不知名的主人，已经在其中一块画布上开了个头——一个灰土土的红发男子的雏形。这开头的几笔脏兮兮的，而且很难看。画画的年轻人很不明智，没有继续画下去。他肯定没有什么发自内心的难以抑制的冲动。就画画来说，他内心是一片空白。或者，即使他内心有什么想法，而且这想法停留在了他心里，他画出来的也只是一点儿灰土土的“泥团”。</td>
		<td class="en">Things happen, and we have no choice.If Maria Huxley hadn’t come rolling up to our house near Florence with four rather large canvases, one of which she had busted, and presented them to me because they had been abandoned in her house, I might never have started in on a real picture in my life.But those nice stretched canvases were too tempting.We had been painting doors and window-frames in the house, so there was a little stock of oil, turps and colour in powder, such as one buys from an Italian drogheria.There were several brushes for house-painting.There was a canvas on which the unknown owner had made a start—mud-grey, with beginnings of a red-haired man.It was a grimy and ugly beginning, and the young man who had made it had had unwisely gone no further.He certainly had had no inner compulsion: nothing in him, as far as paint was concerned, or if here was anything in him, it had stayed in, and only a bit of the mud-grey “group” had come out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，纯粹为了从遮住表面、抹去那块灰土土的痕迹中找到乐趣，我坐在地板上，把画布靠在椅子上，用小锅装好漆房子用的刷子和颜料。就这样，我完全沉浸于在画布上作画的工作。对我来说，有一块空白的画布和一把蘸满湿颜料的大刷子，开始忘我地画画，这就是最为激动人心的时刻。这就像是一头扎进池塘，然后开始疯狂地游。就我而言，这就像是在激流中游泳，让人感到相当恐惧、相当兴奋，上气不接下气，用尽全力挣扎。睿智的眼神像针一样尖锐，但画却完全出自本能、直觉和纯粹的身体动作。一旦将本能和直觉融入笔尖，画就产生了，如果这算是一幅画的话。</td>
		<td class="en">So for the sheer fun of covering a surface and obliterating that mud-grey, I sat on the floor with the canvas propped against a chair—and with my house-paint brushes and colours in little casseroles, I disappeared into that canvas.It is to me the most exciting moment—when you have the blank canvas and a big brush full of wet colour, and you plunge.It is just like diving into a pond—then you start frantically to swim.So far as I am concerned, it is like swimming in a baffling current and being rather frightened and very thrilled, gasping and striking out for all you’re worth.The knowing eye watches sharp as a needle; but the picture comes clean out of instinct, intuition and sheer physical action.Once the instinct and intuition gets into the bush-tip, the picture happens, if it is to be a picture at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至少，我的第一幅画就是这样产生的，我给它取名为《神圣的一家》。几个小时里，一切就都有了：男人、女人、孩子、蓝衬衣、红披巾、灰白的房间——虽然一切都很粗糙，但我觉得这是一幅画。难事还在后面。然而，要么在最初的冲动下完成画作，要么什么都画不出来。只有在画作成形之后，画家才能苦苦挣扎，将它一点儿一点儿完善，直至完成。</td>
		<td class="en">At least, so my first picture happened—the one I have called @A Holy Family@.In a couple of hours there it all was, man, woman, child, blue shirt, red shawl, pale room—all in the rough, but, as far as I am concerned, a picture.The struggling comes later.But the picture itself comes in the first rush, or not at all.It is only when the picture has come into being that one struggle and make it grow to completion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们的时代过于理智。我们知道得很多，感受得却很少。我时常与画家们生活在一起，时常穿梭于画室之间，这足以使我的头脑中充斥着各式各样的理论——不管它们是多么地自相矛盾。为了消化一切铜钉铁丝般的现代艺术理论，一个人得像鸵鸟一样拥有一个砂囊。或许所有的理论，那些完全无法消化的理论，就像鸵鸟砂囊里的钉子一样，确实有助于把艺术家灵魂中所有感性的和审美的食粮磨碎，使之容易消化。但是，它们没有其他的功能了。它们甚至连矫正的功能都没有。现代艺术理论不可能造就真正的画作。你得到的只有那些阐释、对绘画的批判，以及不切实际的否定。否定中存在的一点儿幻想——正如在杜飞或基里科的画中那样——恰恰就是那些逃离了理论的束缚，或许还拯救了画作的那点儿幻想。理论化，将你喜欢的一切事物都理论化——但是，一旦开始作画，就请闭上理论的眼睛，依靠你的本能和直觉。</td>
		<td class="en">Ours is an excessively conscious age.We know so much, we feel so little.I have lived enough among painters and around studios to have had all the theories—and how contradictory they are—rammed down my throat.A man has to have a gizzard like an ostrich to digest all the brass-tacks and wire nails of modern art theories.Perhaps all the theories, the utterly indigestible theories, like nails in an ostrich’s gizzard, do indeed help to grind small and make digestible all the emotional and aesthetic pabulum that lies in an artist’s soul.But they can serve no other purpose.Not even corrective.The modern theories of art make real pictures impossible.You only get these expositions, critical ventures in paint, and fantastic negations.And the bit of fantasy that may lie in the negation—as in a Dufy or a Chirico—is just the bit that has escaped theory and perhaps saves the picture.Theorize, theorize all you like—but when you start to paint, shut your theoretic eyes and go for it with instinct and intuition.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于我自己，我一直喜爱绘画，喜爱绘画艺术。我从来没有上过艺术学校，这辈子也只上过一堂真正的美术课。但是，我当然接受过完整的“绘画”训练。比如立体几何类、石膏模型类以及线条类。我认为，立体几何类体现了透视画法的所有基本原理，因而这方面的训练很有价值。然而，线条类和石膏模型光影类的训练却是有害的。因为我一直对石膏模型和线条的轮廓十分反感，所以我很早就断定自己“不会画画”。我不会画画，所以我一个人什么也做不成。当我真正开始临摹《自然》杂志上一罐罐的花朵、面包、土豆，或小路边的村舍时，结果并没有十分令人激动。在我看来，《自然》或多或少像是石膏模型——密涅瓦的石膏模型头像，或《濒死的角斗士》的塑像，都让年轻时候的我望而却步。不管是什么“对象”，一旦坐在它跟前画它，我总会感到一种轻微的反感。于是，我当然就断定自己无法真正地作画了。或许我无法作画。但我真得确信，我能画画，这对我来说至关重要。绘画的艺术存在于作画的过程中——很多艺术家离在画布上完成一幅画还差得很远。</td>
		<td class="en">Myself, I have always loved pictures, the pictorial art.I never went to an art school, I have had only one real lesson in painting in all my life.But of course I was thoroughly drilled in “drawing”.The solid-geometry sort, and the plaster-cast sort, and the pin-wire sort.I think the solid-geometry sort, with all the elementary laws of perspective, was valuable.But the pin-wire sort and the plaster-cast light-and-shade sort was harmful.Plaster-casts and pin-wire outlines were always so repulsive to me, I quite early decided I “couldn’t draw”.I couldn’t draw, so I could never do anything on my own.When I did paint jugs of flowers or bread and potatoes, or cottages in a lane, copying from Nature, the result wasn’t very thrilling.Nature was more or less of a plaster-cast to me—those plaster-cast heads of Minerva or figures of Dying Gladiators which so unnerved me as a youth.The “object”, be it what it might, was always slightly repulsive to me once I sat down in front of it, to paint it.So, of course, I decided I couldn’t really paint.Perhaps I can’t.But I verily believe I can make pictures, which is to me all that matters in this respect.The art of painting consists in making pictures—and so many artists accomplish canvases without coming within miles of painting a picture.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我学习绘画的方式是先临摹其他画作，通常是临摹复制品，有时甚至会临摹照片。我小的时候是多么沉迷于此啊！当时临摹的是某本杂志中一些没有任何价值的风景画复制品。我用几乎快干了的水彩颜料一笔一笔地画，一次涂半平方英寸，每平方英寸都涂得完美无瑕，像马赛克般一块一块地推进，根本没想过一次画上一大片。我连续数小时高度集中注意力，一英寸一英寸地画。虽然这是一种完全错误的方法，但当那些临摹的作品完成时，我总有种欣喜的感觉，因为里面有一种我认为很美的生命的光芒。你向画中注入生命力，画就会活起来。如果你没有赋予其生命力——没有激动，也没有视觉发现带来的快乐或欣喜凝聚其中——那么这幅画就会像众多的画布一样是死的，无论你在上面投入了多么彻底、多么科学的努力。即使你临摹的只是一幅极为平庸的老桥的复制品，然而，对这座老桥或其周围气氛的某种敏锐而喜悦的感受，或老桥在你心中激发的意象，都能在纸上传达出来，给原本平庸的构思增添一丝生气。</td>
		<td class="en">I learnt to paint from copying other pictures—usually reproductions, sometimes even photographs.When I was a boy, how I concentrated over it!Copying some perfectly worthless scene reproduction in some magazine.I worked with almost dry water-colour, stroke by stroke, covering half a square-inch at a time, each square-inch perfect and completed, proceeding in a kind of mosaic advance, with no idea at all of laying on a broad wash.Hours and hours of intense concentration, inch by inch progress, in a method entirely wrong—and yet those copies of mine managed, when they were finished, to have a certain something that delighted me: a certain glow of life, which was beauty to me.A picture lives with the life you put into it.If you put no life into it—no thrill, no concentration of delight or exaltation of visual discovery—then the picture is dead, like so many canvases, no matter how much thorough and scientific work is put into it.Even if you only copy a purely banal reproduction of an old bridge, some sort of keen, delighted awareness of the old bridge or of its atmosphere, or the image it has kindled inside you, can go over on to the paper and give a certain touch of life to a banal conception.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >想成为一名艺术家，无论是什么样的艺术家，都需要拥有纯洁的灵魂。“保佑那些灵魂纯洁的人，因为他们的灵魂就是天国。”这句座右铭应该写在每一所艺术学校的大门之上。但是，我们所说的“灵魂纯洁”就是指灵魂纯洁。一名艺术家也许是一个行为放荡的人，从社会角度看，就是一个无赖。但如果他能画出一个裸女或几个苹果，而且画得活灵活现，那么他的灵魂就是纯洁的，而且他的灵魂在眼下就是天国。无论是视觉的、文学的，还是音乐的艺术，一切艺术的开端都是纯洁的灵魂。它与善良不是一回事。它比善良更难以实现，更接近于神性。神性不仅仅是善良，而是一切。</td>
		<td class="en">It needs a certain purity of spirit to be an artist, of any sort.The motto which should be written over every School of Art is: “Blessed are the pure in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”But by “pure in spirit” we mean pure in spirit.An artist may be a profligate and, from the social point of view, a scoundrel.But if he can paint a nude woman, or a couple of apples, so that they are a living image, then he was pure in spirit, and, for the time being, his was the kingdom of heaven.This is the beginning of all art, visual or literary or musical: be pure in spirit.It isn’t the same as goodness.It is much more difficult and nearer the divine.The divine isn’t only good, it is all things.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有人也许会在自然事物中看到神性，我今天就在巴塞罗那的兰布拉大道上看到了神性。那儿有很多雅致的花摊，里面有一些长在长梗上的小山茶花，花朵十分娇嫩可人。它们与常见的硕大的山茶花不同，更像是形态优美的栀子花，我看它们就像看幻影一样。于是现在，我可以把它们画出来了。但如果我买了一把山茶花，并把它们“从自然中”画下来，那么，我是画不出来的。凝视着它们，我反而画不出来。我是靠经验来学习的。这只是个人经验。有些人只有在凝视得几乎视而不见时才会产生想象，比如塞尚，但凝视却会扼杀我的想象。这就是我在学校无法“作画”的原因。在学校里，你要把凝视的事物画下来。</td>
		<td class="en">One may see the divine in natural objects; I saw it today, in the frail, lovely little camellia flowers on long stems, here on the bushy and splendid flower-stalls of the Ramblas in Barcelona.They were different from the usual fat camellias, more like gardenias, poised delicately, and I saw them like a vision.So now, I could paint them.But if I had bought a handful, and started in to paint them “from nature”, then I should have lost them.By staring at them I should have lost them.I have learnt by experience.It is personal experience only.Some men can only get at a vision by staring themselves blind, as it were: like Cézanne; but staring kills my vision.That’s why I could never “draw” at school.One was supposed to draw what one stared at.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个人唯一能够观察、凝视，并只能从中看到想象的东西，就是想象本身，即想象中的意象。因此，我很高兴自己从未接受过任何训练，而只是摹仿别人的画作进行自我训练而已。随着我的野心越来越强大，我临摹了利德的风景画、弗兰克·布朗温的卡通画，还有彼得·德温特和吉尔丁的水彩画。 我年轻时，画室出版社出版过八册英国水彩画家系列丛书，对此我至今仍觉得万分感激。虽然我只有八册从书中的六册，但它们对我来说却是无价之宝。我欣喜万分地临摹这里面的画，发现一些画极难临摹。当然，我在临摹这些水彩画复制品上花费了极大的精力，与大多数学习现代艺术的学生在多年学习过程中投入的全部精力相当。我从中收获颇丰。我不仅掌握了处理水彩画的大量技巧——任何人只要试着临摹英国水彩画家的作品，从保罗·桑比、彼得·德温特和吉尔丁，到弗兰克·布朗温以及布拉巴宗这样的印象派画家，他就会知道自己需要多少技巧了——还培养了自己想象的意识。我认为，一个人只有通过与想象进行密切接触，才能培养想象意识，即理解画作，理解真正凭想象创作的画作，通过对它们进行思考，真正地深入画作之中。深入到画作之中有一种巨大的快乐。但这需要纯洁的灵魂，需要摒弃庸俗的感受和低俗的趣味，最重要的是摒弃庸俗的事物，很少有人知道如何去做。哦，要是艺术学校只教这些就好了！如果艺术学校的老师不说：这幅画画错了，这样不对，画得太糟糕了等等，而是说：这样画是不是品味低了点儿？会不会略显僵硬？那弧线是不是太死板了，看上去一点儿对生命的敏锐意识都没有？——但是，我们对待艺术的方式完全是错误的。我们似乎把它当作了一门科学，但它并不是科学。艺术是一种宗教形式，不过少了属于社会学领域的十诫。艺术是一种极为敏锐的意识与和谐的形式，意思是一体，即物我合一。但这种伟大的和谐是寓于快乐之中的吗？——反正我从来都只把艺术当作一种快乐。在我的一生中，我总是时不时地回到绘画之中，因为它给我带来了一种文字无法给予我的快乐。文字中的乐趣或许更为深刻，因而也更难察觉。有意识的快乐当然在绘画中更为强烈。我回到绘画中寻找真正的快乐——我所指的绘画，就是临摹，临摹油画或水彩画。在临摹弗拉·安吉里柯的《逃入埃及》和劳伦泽蒂的大幅画作《底拜得》时，我觉得自己得到了最大的快乐。在临摹这些画作的照片时，我自己上了颜色。或许在威尼斯临摹卡帕西奥的一幅画时，我感觉更好些。然后我真正地领悟到，一幅伟大画作中的每一条曲线和每一个动作都拥有着生命力，拥有着强大的生命力。要画出内心的想象，就需要纯洁的灵魂、敏锐的感觉和强烈的渴望，这样自然而然就可以全部画出来了。相比之下，英国的水彩画较为单薄，而法国和弗兰芒的画则有些肤浅。我从来没有尝试过临摹伟大的伦勃朗的画，尽管我曾经比现在还要极度热爱他的画。我也从来没有尝试过临摹鲁本斯的画，虽然我一直都非常喜欢他的画，不过他似乎太过张扬了。但是，我临摹过彼得·德霍赫和凡代克的画，还临摹过一些人的画，他们的名字我不记得了。在临摹像卡尔帕乔这样的意大利画家的作品、国家美术馆里那幅可爱的《普罗克里斯之死》、乌菲季博物馆中那幅画有穿红裤子的人的《婚礼》以及乔托在帕杜阿画的一幅画时，我体会到了前所未有的深深的激动之情。年轻时，我肯定临摹过很多画，并从中得到了无穷的乐趣。</td>
		<td class="en">The only thing one can look into, stare into, and see only vision, is the vision itself: the visionary image.That is why I am glad I never had any training but the self-imposed training of copying other men’s pictures.As I grew more ambitious, I copied Leader’s landscapes, and Frank Brangwyn’s cartoon-like pictures, then Peter de Wint and Girtin water-colours.I can never be sufficiently grateful for the series of English water-colour painters, published by the Studio in eight parts, when I was a youth.I had only six of the eight parts, but they were invaluable to me.I copied them with the greatest joy, and found some of them extremely difficult.Surely I put as much labour into copying from those water-colour reproductions as most modern art students put into all their years of study.And I had enormous profit from it.I not only acquired a considerable technical skill in handling water-colour—let any man try copying the English water-colour artists, from Paul Sandby and Peter de Wint and Girtin, up to Frank Brangwyn and the impressionists like Brabazon, and he will see how much skill he requires—but also I developed my visionary awareness.And I believe one can only develop one’s visionary awareness by close contact with the vision itself: that is, by knowing pictures, real vision pictures, and by dwelling on them, and really dwelling in them.It is a great delight, to dwell in a picture.But it needs a purity of spirit, a sloughing of vulgar sensation and vulgar interest, and above all, vulgar contact, that few people know how to perform.Oh, if art schools only taught that!If, instead of saying: This drawing is wrong, incorrect, badly drawn, etc., they would say: Isn’t this in bad taste? isn’t it insensitive? isn’t that an insentient curve with none of the delicate awareness of life in it?—But art is treated all wrong.It is treated as if it were a science, which it is not.Art is form of religion, minus the Ten Commandment business, which is sociological.Art is a form of supremely delicate awareness and atonement—meaning at-oneness, the state of being at one with the object.But is the great atonement in delight?—for I can never look on art save as a form of delight.All my life I have from time to time gone back to paint, because it gave me a form of delight that words can never give.Perhaps the joy in words goes deeper and is for that reason more unconscious.The conscious delight is certainly stronger in paint.I have gone back to paint for real pleasure—and by paint I mean copying, copying either in oils or waters.I think the greatest pleasure I ever got came from copying Fra Angelica’s @Flight in to Egypt@ and Lorenzetti’s big picture of Thebaid, in each case working from photographs and putting in my own colour; or perhaps even more a Carpaccio picture in Venice.Then I really learned what life, what powerful life has been put into every curve, every motion of a great picture.Purity of spirit, sensitive awareness, intense eagerness to portray an inward vision, how it all comes.The English water-colours are frail in comparison—and the French and the Flemings are shallow.The great Rembrandt I never tried to copy, though I loved him intensely, even more than I do now; and Rubens I never tried, though I always like him so much, only he seemed so spread out.But I have copied Peter de Hooch and Vandyck, and others that I forget.Yet none of them gave me the deep thrill of the Italians, Carpaccio, or the lovely @Death of Procris@ in the National Gallery, or that @Wedding@ with the scarlet legs, in the Uffizi, or a Giotto from Padua.I must have made many copies in my day, and got endless joy out of them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然，我有了一块空白的画布，觉得自己可以亲自创作一幅画。关键在于在一块空白的画布上作画。到了四十岁，我才真正有勇气尝试着作画。之后，作画成了狂欢。</td>
		<td class="en">Then suddenly, by having a blank canvas, I discovered I could make a picture myself.That is the point, to make a picture on a blank canvas.And I was forty before I had the real courage to try.Then it became an orgy, making pictures.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，我已经学会了不用实物，不用模型，不用技巧。有时，我会直接根据模型来画一幅水彩画。但这么做总会把画给毁了。只有当画作完成之后，我才能使用模型。这时，我可以看看模型，发现一些我设想不到的细节，或是对自己觉得不满意却又不明白原因的地方做一些修改。之后，模型也许会给我一点儿启发。但如果一开始就用模型，只会把画给毁了。画作必须完全出自艺术家的内心，出自对形式和轮廓的感知。我们可以称之为记忆，但它又不仅仅是记忆。这是一种存在于我们的意识之中的形象，虽然如同想象一样生动，但却从未被我们认知。我相信，许多人意识中都有一些鲜活的意象，通过呈现出这些意象，他们能够给自己带来最大的乐趣。但是，他们不知道如何处理。教育只会阻碍他们。</td>
		<td class="en">I have learnt now not to work from objects, not to have models, not to have a technique.Sometimes, for a water-colour, I have worked direct from a model.But it always spoils the picture.I can only use a model when the picture is already made; then I can look at the model to get some detail which the vision failed me with, or to modify something which I feel is unsatisfactory and I don’t know why.Then a model may give a suggestion.But at the beginning, a model only spoils the picture.The picture must all come out of the artist’s inside, awareness of forms and figures.We can call it memory, but it is more than memory.It is the image as it lives in the consciousness, alive like a vision, but unknown.I believe many people have, in their consciousness, living images that would give them the greatest joy to bring out.But they don’t know how to go about it.And teaching only hinders them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我认为，一幅画必须蕴含一些令人快乐的东西，否则它就不是画了。在皮埃罗·德拉·弗兰西斯卡、索德玛或戈雅所作的最令人忧伤的画作中，依然有一些难以名状的令人快乐的东西，它们是真正的绘画所具备的东西。虽然现代评论家经常谈论丑陋，但我从来不觉得自己看到的哪一幅真正的画作是丑陋的。画作的主题也许是丑陋的，特性也许是可怕的、压抑的、甚至令人反感的，比如埃尔·格列柯的画。然而，画中蕴含的快乐却会以一种奇怪的方式将这些丑陋之处一扫而空。没有一位艺术家——哪怕是最忧郁的艺术家——在作画过程中不曾感受到这种奇妙无比的快乐。</td>
		<td class="en">To me, a picture has delight in it, or it isn’t a picture.The saddest pictures of Piero della Francesca or Sodoma or Goya, have still that indescribable delight that goes with the real picture.Modern critics talk a lot about ugliness, but I never saw a real picture that seemed to me ugly.The theme may be ugly, there may be a terrifying, distressing, almost repulsive quality, as in El Greco.Yet it is all, in some strange way, swept up in the delight of a picture.No artist, even the gloomiest, ever painted a picture without the curious delight in image-making.</td></tr>
