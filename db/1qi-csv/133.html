		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看看那具尸体，”殡仪员边说边满意地拍拍死者叠放在一起的双手，“那就是一块砖头——你怎样动他，他都是一块砖头。他临终前真是太热心、太谦逊，也太朴实了。朋友们都希望用金属制的棺材——别的一概不行。可我没办法弄到。也没那个时间了——这大伙都能看出来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now that corpse,” said the undertaker, patting the folded hands of deceased approvingly, “was a brick—every way you took him he was a brick.He was so real accommodating, and so modest-like and simple in his last moments.Friends wanted metallic burial-case—nothing else would do.I couldn’t get it.There warn’t going to be time—anybody could see that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“死者说没关系，给他弄个能舒舒服服伸直手脚的盒子就行，他对棺材的外观样式没什么讲究。还说相比样式他更在意空间大小，不管怎样那也是他最后的容身之处。</td>
		<td class="en">“Corpse said never mind, shake him up some kind of a box he could stretch out in comfortable, he wasn’t particular about the general style of it.Said he went more on room than style, anyway in a last final container.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友们希望在棺材上放个银标牌，标出他是谁、从哪里来。你该知道在这样的乡村小镇，一个小人物能上哪里去找来那么花哨的东西？死者怎么说？</td>
		<td class="en">“Friends wanted a silver door-plate on the coffin, signifying who he was and where he was from.Now you know a fellow couldn’t roust out such a gaily thing as that in a little country-town like this.What did corpse say?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“死者说，把他那艘旧独木舟刷成白色，用黑色的毛刷和蜡板刻上他的住址和墓地所在的地方，同时从合适的赞美诗或其他诗歌里选取一节，刻在墓碑上，并将他注明为C. O. D.，然后就任由他自生自灭吧。他并未像你那么沮丧——恰恰相反，他像拉灵车的马一样平静镇定，他认定自己将要去的那个地方的人们会觉得美好的道德品质远比挂着漂亮标牌的整洁的棺材更为引人关注。</td>
		<td class="en">“Corpse said, whitewash his old canoe and dob his address and general destination onto it with a blacking-brush and a stencil-plate, ’long with a verse from some likely hymn or other, and p’int him for the tomb, and mark him C. O. D., and just let him flicker.He warn’t distressed any more than you be—on the contrary, just as calm and collected as a hearse-horse; said he judged that where he was going to a body would find it considerable better to attract attention by a picturesque moral character than a natty burial-case with a swell door-plate on it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是个了不起的人。比起过去七年里接收过的那些死者，我更乐意为这样的死者服务。在埋葬像他这样的人时，我总会产生一种满足感。你会觉得有人真心感激你正在做的事情。上帝保佑你，要是他能在腐烂之前就下葬，他就十分满意了。他说亲戚们本意是好的，非常好，但他们所有的准备肯定会或多或少推迟下葬时间，他可不希望自己老被这么摆在一旁。你从未见过像他这样清晰的头脑——又冷静，又镇定。那不过是一大块大脑——他还是原来的他。真是吓人。那个人的脑袋，从这一侧到另一侧的间距相当完美。他有脑膜炎，还老在那么一块地方发作，其余部分没一丁点儿感觉——简直就像亚利桑那州印第安人暴动时，大西洋沿岸各州未受影响一样。“当然，他的亲戚们想办个大型葬礼，但死者说他已经听够了那些假恭维，也不要什么送葬队伍——送葬的人都挤在灵车上，并用尾缆将他拖在后面。他最讨厌的就是我曾经为所有接收过的遗体办理的那种送葬仪式。他真是个漂亮单纯的人，这一点你不用怀疑。他只是想要让事情按照他设想的那样去办，他也在落实他的小计划的过程中得到实实在在的安慰。他让我从各个方位量了他的身体尺寸，接着又让牧师在一个盖着桌布的长盒子后面站好，以此来代表棺材。然后他就让牧师开始致悼词，说到精彩部分，他就会说：‘好，好！’他还让牧师把所有吹嘘他的大话都给去掉。然后，他让人把唱诗班请上去，帮他们选定自己葬礼中最合适的曲目，最后他选了《啪！黄鼠狼走开》让他们唱，因为每当心情不好时，他就会听这首歌，庄严的歌曲他听了会难过。而当他们含泪演唱时（因为他们都很爱他），亲友们都陷入悲痛之中，他却高高兴兴地躺在那里，还试着跟着音乐打拍子，显出一副无比享受的样子；一会儿，他便变得兴奋起来，想加入进去一起唱，因为，请注意，他可是对自己的歌唱才能相当自豪的；然而他刚张开嘴，准备舒展一下时，他就没气了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Splendid man, he was.I’d rather do for a corpse like that than any I’ve tackled in seven years.There’s some satisfaction in buring a man like that.You feel that what you’re doing is appreciated.Lord bless you, so he got planted before he spoiled, he was perfectly satisfied; said his relations meant well, perfectly well, but all their preparations was bound to delay the thing more or less, and he didn’t wish to be kept laying around.You never see such a clear head as what he had—and so calm and so cool.Jist a hunk of brains—that is what he was.Perfectly awful.It was a ripping distance from one end of that man’s head to the other.Often and over again he’s had brain-fever arraging in one place, and the rest of the pile didn’t know anything about it—didn’t affect it any more than an Injun Insurrection in Arizona affects the Atlantic States.“Well, the relations they wanted a big funeral, but corpse said he was down on flummery—didn’t want any procession—fill the hearse full of mourners, and get out a stern line and tow him behind.He was the most down on style of any remains I ever struck.A beautiful, simpleminded creature it was what he was, you can depend on that.He was just set on having things the way he wanted them, and he took a solid comfort in laying his little plans.He had me measure him and take a whole raft of directions; then he had the minister stand up behind a long box with a table-cloth over it, to represent the coffin, and read his funeral sermon, saying ‘Angcore, angcore!’ at the good places, and making him scratch out every bit of brag about him, and all the hifalutin; and then he made them trot out the choir, so he could help them pick out the tunes for the occasion, and he got them to sing ‘Pop Goes the Weasel,’ because he’d always liked that tune when he was downhearted, and solemn music made him sad; and when they sung that with tears in their eyes (because they all loved him), and his relations grieving around, he just laid there as happy as a bug, and trying to beat time and showing all over how much he enjoyed it; and presently he got worked up and excited, and tried to join in, for, mind you, he was pretty proud of his abilities in the singing line; but the first time he opened his mouth and was just going to spread himself his breath took a walk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我从没见过有人这么突然就断气了。哎呀，这真是个大损失——特别是对这个又穷又小的乡村小镇来说，真是不得了的损失。行了，行了，行了，我可没时间耗在这儿闲扯了，我得去把那棺材钉上，然后带他走；要是你能载我一程，我们就一起把他弄上灵车，在路上接着聊会儿。亲属们一定会这么干——只要他一死，就不管他临死时的指示了。但我要是擅作主张，不好好遵从他的遗愿，把他拖在灵车后面，我会被诅咒的。我认为，死者为了死得舒坦点无论提什么要求都不过分，谁也没有权利骗他或利用他，死者信任我才让我做的事，无论是什么我都会去做，哪怕是要把他做成标本，涂上一身颜色，当纪念品保存起来——你没听错，我真会这么做！”</td>
		<td class="en">“I never see a man snuffed out so sudden.Ah, it was a great loss—a, powerful loss to this poor little one-horse town.Well, well, well, I havn’t got time to be palavering along here—got to nail on the lid and mosey along with him; and if you’ll just give me a lift we’ll skeet him into the hearse and meander along.Relations bound to have it so—don’t pay no attention to dying injunctions, minute a corpse’s gone; but, if I had my way, if I didn’t respect his last wishes and tow him behind the hearse I’ll be cussed.I consider that whatever a corpse wants done for his comfort is little enough matter, and a man hasn’t got no right to deceive him or take advantage of him; and whatever a corpse trusts me to do I’m going to do, you know, even if it’s to stuff him and paint him yaller and keep him for a keepsake—you hear me!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他噼噼啪啪地挥着马鞭，驾着他那辆古旧的灵车缓缓离开了。而我一边继续往前走，一边想着刚学到的宝贵一课——无论干哪一行，保持一种健康向上、有益身心的乐观精神并不是没有可能的。我会永远记得这一课，因为记忆中当时的话语和所经历的场景，不知要花掉多少年月才能忘却。</td>
		<td class="en">He cracked his whip and went lumbering away with his ancient ruin of a hearse, and I continued my walk with a valuable lesson learned—that a healthy and wholesome cheerfulness is not necessarily impossible to any occupation.The lesson is likely to be lasting, for it will take many months to obliterate the memory of the remarks and circumstances that impressed it.</td></tr>
