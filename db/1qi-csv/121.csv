"一次电话交谈","A Telephonic Conversation"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"我认为电话交谈——你只是坐在旁边却根本没有参与谈话——是现代生活中最严肃的奇事之一。昨天在我写一篇关于崇高哲学主题的深奥文章时，有人在房间里进行了这样一次交谈。我发现有人在旁边打电话时，文章总能写得最好。嗯，事情就这样开始了。一位家里的人走进来，要我用家里的电话接通住在闹市区的巴格利先生家。我发现，在很多城市，女性总是不愿意自己给电话总机打电话。不知道为什么，但她们总是这样。所以我拿起了电话，谈话就这样开始了：","Consider that a conversation by telephone—when you are simply siting by and not taking any part in that conversation—is one of the solemnest curiosities of modern life.Yesterday I was writing a deep article on a sublime philosophical subject while such a conversation was going on in the room.I notice that one can always write best when somebody is talking through a telephone close by.Well, the thing began in this way.A member of our household came in and asked me to have our house put into communication with Mr. Bagley’s downtown.I have observed, in many cities, that the sex always shrink from calling up the central office themselves.I don’t know why, but they do.So I touched the bell, and this talk ensued:"
"电话总机：（粗鲁地）喂！","CENTRAL OFFICE. (GRUFFY.) Hello!"
"我：是总机吗？","I. Is it the Central Office?"
"电话总机：当然是了。你要转接到哪里？","C. O. Of course it is.What do you want?"
"我：您能帮我转接到巴格利家吗？","I. Will you switch me on to the Bagleys, please?"
"电话总机。好的。别挂断。","C. O. All right.Just keep your ear to the telephone."
"接着我听到一连串“咔嗒咔嗒咔嗒”的声音！然后听到讨厌的“磨”牙声，最后是一个很尖的女声：喂？（升调）是你找我吗？","Then I heard K-LOOK, K-LOOK, K’LOOK—KLOOK-KLOOK-KLOOK-LOOK-LOOK! then a horrible “gritting” of teeth, and finally a piping female voice: Y-e-s?(RISING INFLECTION.) Did you wish to speak to me?"
"我没有回答，把电话给了要我打电话的人，然后坐了下来。接下来世界上最奇怪的事情发生了——只能听到一端在说话。你能听得到有人问问题，但是听不到回答。你听得到有人发出邀请，但听不到相应的感谢。停顿时你会听到死一般的寂静，然后不知是由于惊喜、悲伤还是沮丧而发出的明显不相干甚至莫名其妙的惊叫。你无法弄清楚他们在谈什么，因为你根本听不到电话线另一端的那个人在说什么。嗯，我听到下面一连串不寻常的谈话，都是一个人说的，并且一直在大呼小叫——因为你从来都不可能劝女性对着电话温柔地讲话：","Without answering, I handed the telephone to the applicant, and sat down.Then followed that queerest of all the queer things in this world—a conversation with only one end of it.You hear questions asked; you don’t hear the answer.You hear invitations given; you hear no thanks in return.You have listening pauses of dead silence, followed by apparently irrelevant and unjustifiable exclamations of glad surprise or sorrow or dismay.You can’t make head or tail of the talk, because you never hear anything that the person at the other end of the wire says.Well, I heard the following remarkable series of observations, all from the one tongue, and all shouted—for you can’t ever persuade the sex to speak gently into a telephone:"
"喂？啊，怎么会发生那种事？","Yes?Why, how did THAT happen?"
"间断。","Pause."
"你说什么？","What did you say?"
"间断。","Pause."
"哦不，我不认为是那样的。","Oh no, I don’t think it was."
"间断。","Pause."
"不！哦不，我不是那个意思。我的意思是，在煮沸的时候放进去——或者要煮沸之前放进去。","NO!Oh no, I didn’t mean THAT.I meant, put it in while it is still boiling—or just before it COMES to a boil."
"间断。","Pause."
"什么？","WHAT?"
"间断。","Pause."
"我把它翻过来，在镶边的边缘倒着缝了一下。","I turned it over with a backstitch on the selvage edge."
"间断。","Pause."
"是的，我也喜欢那样，但我觉得最好用长针缝，缝在瓦朗谢讷花边或者斜纹布上，或者类似的布料上。这样的话特别好看——而且还会吸引别人注意。","Yes, I like that way, too; but I think it’s better to baste it on with Valenciennes or bombazine, or something of that sort.It gives it such an air—and attracts so much noise."
"间断。","Pause."
"那是《申命记》第49章，包括从第64节到97节之间的部分。我觉得我们应该经常读一读。","It’s forty-ninth Deuteronomy, sixty-forth to ninety-seventh inclusive.I think we ought all to read it often."
"间断。","Pause."
"或许吧，我一般用发夹。","Perhaps so; I generally use a hair pin."
"间断。","Pause."
"你说什么？（向一边）孩子们，安静点！","What did you say?(ASIDE.) Children, do be quiet!"
"间断。","Pause"
"哎呀！B栋公寓！天，我以为你说的是猫！","OH!B FLAT!Dear me, I thought you said it was the cat!"
"间断。","Pause."
"从什么时候？","Since WHEN?"
"间断。","Pause."
"哦，我从没听说过。","Why, I never heard of it."
"间断。","Pause."
"你太让我吃惊了！这好像完全不可能！","You astound me!It seems utterly impossible!"
"间断。","Pause."
"谁干的？","WHO did?"
"间断。","Pause."
"天哪！","Good-ness gracious!"
"间断。","Pause."
"哦，这个世界是怎么了？就在教堂里吗？","Well, what IS this world coming to?Was it right in CHURCH?"
"间断。","Pause."
"她妈妈在那吗？","And was her MOTHER there?"
"间断。","Pause."
"哎呀，巴格利太太，我会羞死的！他们都干了什么啊？","Why, Mrs. Bagley, I should have died of humiliation!What did they DO?"
"长长的停顿。","Long pause."
"我不是非常确定，因为我没带笔记，不过我记得差不多这样：特啰哩啰啰，啰啰哩啰啰，哦特哩啰啰哩哩哩哎哆！然后重复，你知道吧。","I can’t be perfectly sure, because I haven’t the notes by me; but I think it goes something like this: te-rolly-loll-loll, loll lolly-loll-loll, O tolly-loll-loll-LEE-LY-LI-I-do!And then REPEAT, you know."
"间断。","Pause."
"是的，我觉得要是你能弹奏好小行板和弱音的话，那么一定很甜美——也很庄重，让人印象深刻。","Yes, I think it IS very sweet—and very solemn and impressive, if you get the andantino and the pianissimo right."
"间断。","Pause."
"哦，橡皮糖，橡皮糖！但我从不让他们吃条纹糖。当然，不管怎么说，他们长牙之前都不能吃。","Oh, gum-drops, gum-drops!But I never allow them to eat striped candy.And of course they CAN’T, till they get their teeth, anyway."
"间断。","Pause."
"什么？","WHAT?"
"间断。","Pause."
"哦，压根没有——继续。他正在这儿写呢——没打扰他。","Oh, not in the least—go right on.He’s here writing—it doesn’t bother HIM."
"间断。","Pause."
"非常好，我能去的话就去。（旁边人说）天哪，拿这个东西这么久，胳膊真累啊！我真希望她——","Very well, I’ll come if I can.(ASIDE.) Dear me, how it does tire a person’s arm to hold this thing up so long!I wish she’d—"
"间断。","Pause."
"哦，不，没关系；我喜欢说话——但是我害怕耽误你的事情。","Oh no, not at all; I LIKE to talk—but I’m afraid I’m keeping you from your affairs."
"间断。","Pause."
"有客人？","Visitors?"
"间断。","Pause."
"不，我们从来不在上面加黄油。","No, we never use butter on them."
"间断。","Pause."
"没错，这样很好；不过所有的烹饪书上都写着，过季的话会很不健康。反正他都不喜欢——特别是罐装的。","Yes, that is a very good way; but all the cook-books say they are very unhealthy when they are out of season.And HE doesn’t like them, anyway—especially canned."
"间断。","Pause."
"哦，我觉得太贵了，我从来没买过超过50美分一束的。","Oh, I think that is too high for them; we have never paid over fifty cents a bunch."
"间断。","Pause."
"你必须要走了吗？好吧，再见。","MUST you go?Well, GOOD-by."
"间断。","Pause."
"是的，我也这么认为。再见。","Yes, I think so.GOOD-by."
"间断。","Pause."
"那就四点钟——我会准备好的。再见。","Four o’clock, then—I’ll be ready.GOOD-by."
"间断。","Pause."
"非常感谢。再见。","Thank you ever so much.GOOD-by."
"间断。","Pause."
"哦，根本没有——还那么新鲜——哪一个？哦，听到你这么说我很高兴。再见。","Oh, not at all!—just as fresh—WHICH?Oh, I’m glad to hear you say that.GOOD-by."
"（挂上电话然后说：“唉，胳膊真累啊！”）","(Hangs up the telephone and says, “Oh, it DOES tire a person’s arm so!”)"
"一个男人会冷冷地说“再见”，然后谈话就结束了。而女性却不是这样——我是用赞美的口吻说的。她们受不了这么唐突的行为。","A man delivers a single brutal “Good-by,” and that is the end of it.Not so with the gentle sex—I say it in their praise; they cannot abide abruptness."
