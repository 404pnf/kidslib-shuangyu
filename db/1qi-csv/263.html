		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她曾以为在所有的婚姻中，这次婚姻将是一场冒险。倒不是那个男人本身对她极具魔力。他是个身材矮小、精瘦、相貌古怪的家伙，大她二十岁，有着棕色的眼睛和日渐灰白的头发。许多年前还是个小男孩时，他就从荷兰来美国了，当时他还是个小流浪儿。后来他从西部的金矿被赶到南部，去了墨西哥。现在他或多或少也算是个有钱人了，在马德雷山脉的荒地中拥有银矿。所以很明显，冒险之处在于他复杂的生活经历，而不是他本人。然而尽管历经磨难，身材矮小的他仍然是个精力充沛的人，他所取得的成就都是靠自己一个人完成的。这也是无法解释的人类奇事之一。</td>
		<td class="en">She had thought that this marriage, of all marriages, would be an adventure.Not that the man himself was exactly magical to her.A little, wiry, twisted fellow, twenty years older than herself, with brown eyes and greying hair, who had come to America a scrap of a wastrel, from Holland, years ago, as a tiny boy, and from the gold-mines of the west had been kicked south into Mexico, and now was more or less rich, owning silver-mines in the wilds of the Sierra Madre: it was obvious that the adventure lay in his circumstances, rather than his person.But he was still a little dynamo of energy, in spite of accidents survived, and what he had accomplished he had accomplished alone.One of those human oddments there is no accounting for.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当她亲眼目睹了他的成就时，不禁心生畏惧。被绿色覆盖的巨大山地和丘陵绵延不绝，而在这荒无人烟的地方，淡粉色的出自银矿的干土堆鲜明地显现了出来。在那些光秃秃的银矿下面是围墙圈着的砖坯平房。房里有个花园，还有个深深的内走廊，两侧爬满了热带攀缘植物。当你从这花丛围满的封闭式院子向上看时，你会看到用银泥废料堆成的巨大的粉红色圆锥体，还有顶天放着的提取设备用的器械。此外，再没别的了。</td>
		<td class="en">When she actually saw what he had accomplished, her heart quailed.Great green-covered, unbroken mountain-hills, and in the midst of the lifeless isolation, the sharp pinkish mounds of the dried mud from the silver-works.Under the nakedness of the works, the walled-in, one-storey adobe house, with its garden inside, and its deep inner verandah with tropical climbers on the sides.And when you looked up from this shut-in flowered patio, you saw the huge pink cone of the silver-mud refuse, and the machinery of the extracting plant against heaven above.No more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，巨大的木门是常开着的。她会站在外面，站在广袤开阔的天地中。她会看着高高的、空旷的、被树木覆盖的山丘，绵延相连，不分首尾。在秋天，山丘是绿色的。而其他一切则是淡粉的、干巴巴的、抽象的。</td>
		<td class="en">To be sure, the great wooden doors were often open.And then she could stand outside, in the vast open world.And see great, void, tree-clad hills piling behind one another, from nowhere into nowhere.They were green in autumn time.For the rest, pinkish, stark dry, and abstract.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的丈夫会开着他破旧的福特车，带她去那个死一般的、极为死气沉沉的、被遗忘在山峦里的西班牙小镇。那里有宏伟的、被太阳晒干了的、了无生趣的教堂，有死寂的大门，有令人绝望的有棚顶的市场。第一次去那里的时候，她看到了一只死狗躺在一个个肉摊和蔬菜摊之间，四仰八叉的，似乎永远都不会有人劳神去把它扔掉。死气中透着死气。</td>
		<td class="en">And in his battered Ford car her husband would take her into the dead, thrice-dead little Spanish town forgotten among the mountains.The great, sundried dead church, the dead portales, the hopeless covered market-place, where, the first time she went, she saw a dead dog lying between the meat stalls and the vegetable array, stretched out as if for ever, nobody troubling to throw it away.Deadness within deadness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每个人都一边无力地谈论着银市，一边给别人看小块的银矿石。但是银市停业了。大战来来去去、变化不断。银市很萧条。她丈夫的银矿关闭了。但是她和他还生活在银矿下的砖坯房里。四周虽花丛围绕，但她却从不觉得繁花似锦。</td>
		<td class="en">Everybody feebly talking silver, and showing bits of ore.But silver was at a standstill.The great war came and went.Silver was a dead market.Her husband’s mines were closed down.But she and he lived on in the adobe house under the works, among the flowers that were never very flowery to her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她有两个孩子，一个男孩，一个女孩。老大是男孩，他快十岁时，她才从那种一直被束缚的麻木中惊醒过来。如今她三十三岁，是个身材高大、蓝眼睛、神情有些恍惚的女人，身材开始发福了。她那身材矮小、精瘦而结实、相貌古怪、棕色眼睛的丈夫已经五十三岁了，身体如电缆一般强硬而坚韧，依旧那么精力充沛，只是因为银市的萧条，以及妻子对自己莫名的隔阂而略显消沉。</td>
		<td class="en">She had two children, a boy and a girl.And her eldest, the boy, was nearly ten years old before she aroused from her stupor of subjected amazement.She was now thirty-three, a large, blue-eyed, dazed woman, beginning to grow stout.Her little, wiry, tough, twisted, brown-eyed husband was fifty-three, a man as tough as wire, tenacious as wire, still full of energy, but dimmed by the lapse of silver from the market, and by some curious inaccessibility on his wife’s part.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他是一个有原则的人，是一个好丈夫。从某种程度上说，他对她宠爱有加。他从未摆脱对她的那种另他神魂颠倒的倾慕之情。但是本质上，他还是个单身汉。十岁的时候，当他还是个小单身汉时，就被遗弃到了这个世界上。他结婚时已经四十多了，已经有钱并结婚生活下去了。但是他的资产完全归一个单身汉自己所有。他掌控着自己的事业，而婚姻是他事业上的最后一环，也是最密切的一环。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a man of principles, and a good husband.In a way, he doted on her.He never quite got over his dazzled admiration of her.But essentially, he was still a bachelor.He had been thrown out on the world, a little bachelor, at the age of ten.When he married he was over forty, and had enough money to marry on.But his capital was all a bachelor’s.He was boss of his own works, and marriage was the last and most intimate bit of his own works.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他对妻子的欣赏举世无双；他欣赏她的身体，她所有的一切。对他而言，她永远都是最初认识时那个耀眼的、来自加州伯克利的女孩。像任何酋长一样，他将她置于奇瓦瓦山脉的保护之中。他小心守护着她，就像护着他的银矿一样：这说明了很多东西。</td>
		<td class="en">He admired his wife to extinction, he admired her body, all her points.And she was to him always the rather dazzling Californian girl from Berkeley, whom he had first known.Like any sheik, he kept her guarded among those mountains of Chihuahua.He was jealous of her as he was of his silver-mine: and that is saying a lot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >三十三岁了，除体形外，在其他方面，她真的还是那个来自伯克利的女孩。她的意识从结婚起就不可思议地不再发展了，完全停滞了。对她而言，她的丈夫从来都不是真实存在的，无论是精神上，还是生理上。尽管他对她有几分迟来的激情，但生理上，他于她而言什么都不是。只是在精神上，他左右着她，压制她，让她绝对地臣服。</td>
		<td class="en">At thirty-three she really was still the girl from Berkeley, in all but physique.Her conscious development had stopped mysteriously with her marriage, completely arrested.Her husband had never become real to her, neither mentally nor physically.In spite of his late sort of passion for her, he never meant anything to her, physically.Only morally he swayed her, downed her, kept her in an invincible slavery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >多少年来，洒满阳光的院子四周围着砖房，上面便是银矿。她丈夫从来都呆不住。当银市歇业时，他就在山下大概二十里开外的地方经营牧场，饲养纯种公猪，一种很好养的牲畜。同时，他又厌恶猪。他是个理想主义者，也是个爱吹毛求疵的流浪儿，他着实痛恨生活中物质的一面。他喜欢工作，工作，工作，喜欢制造东西。他的婚姻，他的孩子们，都是他制造出来的，是他生意的一部分，只不过收益的是情感。</td>
		<td class="en">So the years went by, in the adobe house strung round the sunny patio, with the silver-works overhead.Her husband was never still.When the silver went dead, he ran a ranch lower down, some twenty miles away, and raised pure-bred hogs, splendid creatures.At the same time, he hated pigs.He was a squeamish waif of an idealist, and really hated the physical side of life.He loved work, work, work, and making things.His marriage, his children, were something he was making, part of his business, but with a sentimental income this time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >渐渐地，她的精神方面开始出现问题：她必须走出去。她一定要走出去。所以他带她到埃尔帕索呆了三个月。至少那里还是美国。</td>
		<td class="en">Gradually her nerves began to go wrong: she must get out.She must get out.So he took her to El Paso for three months.And at least it was the United States.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是他束缚她的魔咒还在。三个月结束了，她的人虽然回来了，但和以前一样，还是呆在她的砖房里，呆在常年是绿色或粉褐色的山丘之间。而唯一没有被发现的就是空虚。她教育孩子，管理墨西哥僮仆。有时候他丈夫带客人回来，西班牙人或者墨西哥人，偶尔也有白人。</td>
		<td class="en">But he kept his spell over her.The three months ended: back she was, just the same, in her adobe house among those eternal green or pinky-brown hills, void as only the undiscovered is void.She taught her children, she supervised the Mexican boys who were her servants.And sometimes her husband brought visitors, Spaniards or Mexicans or occasionally white men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他十分喜欢有白人呆在这个地方。尽管他们在的时候，他就没有一刻安宁。他的妻子就好像是他矿里的某种独特的秘密矿脉，没人可以知道，除了他自己。她会被有时来作客的年轻绅士，也就是采矿工程师给迷住。他也被真正的绅士所吸引。但他是个有妻室的守旧矿工，如果有绅士看他的妻子，他就觉得好像自己的矿藏被抢掠了，秘密被探出了一样。</td>
		<td class="en">He really loved to have white men staying on the place.Yet he had not a moment’s peace when they were there.It was as if his wife were some peculiar secret vein of ore in his mines, which no one must be aware of except himself.And she was fascinated by the young gentlemen, mining engineers, who were his guests at times.He, too, was fascinated by a real gentleman.But he was an old-timer miner with a wife, and if a gentleman looked at his wife, he felt as if his mine were being looted, the secrets of it pryed out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这些年轻绅士中，有一位让她有了想法。当时他们正站在院子的高大木门外，看着外面的世界。九月的雨后，亘古不动的山峦满是绿色。除了废弃的矿井，废弃的银矿和一排半废弃的矿工居所外，没有任何其他东西的痕迹了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was one of these young gentlemen who put the idea into her mind.They were all standing outside the great wooden doors of the patio, looking at the outer world.The eternal, motionless hills were all green, it was September, after the rains.There was no sign of anything, save the deserted mine, the deserted works, and a bunch of half-deserted miner’s dwellings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想知道，”那个年轻人说道，“这些荒芜的大山背后是什么。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I wonder,” said the young man, “what there is behind those great blank hills.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“更多的山，”莱德曼说，“如果你朝那边走，是索诺拉河和海岸。朝这边是沙漠——你就是从那里来的——而另一边，是丘陵和高山。”</td>
		<td class="en">“More hills,” said Lederman.“If you go that way, Sonora and the coast.This way is the desert—you came from there—And the other way, hills and mountains.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，但是在那些丘陵和高山里有什么活物呢？肯定有什么奇妙的东西吧？那边看上去完全不像是在地球上，而像是在月球上。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, but what lives in the hills and mountains?Surely there is something wonderful?It looks so like nowhere on earth: like being on the moon.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那里有很多猎物，如果你想打猎的话。还有印第安人，如果你觉得他们奇妙的话。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s plenty of game, if you want to shoot.And Indians, if you call them wonderful.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“野蛮的部落？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wild ones?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是够野蛮的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wild enough.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那友善吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But friendly?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不一定。有些非常野蛮，而且他们不让任何人靠近。他们一看到传教士就杀。而传教士都去不了的地方，就没人能去了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It depends.Some of them are quite wild, and they don’t let anybody near.They kill a missionary at sight.And where a missionary can’t get, nobody can.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那政府是怎么说的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But what does the government say?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“政府就鞭长莫及了，根本不管他们。他们很狡猾。如果他们认为有麻烦，就会派个代表团去奇瓦瓦，正式表示臣服。政府也就乐得如此。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They’re so far from everywhere, the government leaves ‘em alone.And they’re wily; if they think there’ll be trouble, they send a delegation to Chihuahua and make a formal submission.The government is glad to leave it at that.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们就过那种原始的生活，保持他们野蛮人自己的风俗和宗教？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And do they live quite wild, with their own savage customs and religion?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，对呀。他们只用弓箭。我在镇上就见过他们，在集市里面，戴着滑稽的帽子，上面插着花。他们一手拿弓，全身就穿了一件衬衫样的衣服，甚至天冷时也只穿这个——露着他们的野腿到处大步走。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, yes.They use nothing but bows and arrows.I’ve seen them in town, in the Plaza, with funny sort of hats with flowers round them, and a bow in one hand, quite naked except for a sort of shirt, even in cold weather—striding round with their savage’s bare legs.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是，你不觉得这很奇妙吗，呆在山上他们那秘密的村庄里？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But don’t you suppose it’s wonderful, up there in their secret villages?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不觉得。这有什么奇妙的？野蛮人就是野蛮人，所有野蛮人的举止都差不多：下贱、肮脏、不讲卫生，还会耍些花招，挣扎着填饱肚皮。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No. What would there be wonderful about it?Savages are savages, and all savages behave more or less alike: rather low-down and dirty, unsanitary, with a few cunning tricks, and struggling to get enough to eat.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是他们肯定有很古老、很古老的宗教和神秘仪式——一定很奇妙，一定。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But surely they have old, old religions and mysteries—it must be wonderful, surely it must.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不知道那些个神秘仪式——嗷嗷直叫，还有异教徒的一些做法，多少有些不雅。不，我看不出那种东西有什么奇妙的。我真不明白，你曾在伦敦、巴黎或者纽约住过，竟然会——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t know about mysteries—howling and heathen practices, more or less indecent.No, I see nothing wonderful in that kind of stuff.And I wonder that you should, when you have lived in London or Paris or New York—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，每个住在伦敦、巴黎或纽约的人——”那个年轻人说道，好像在和人辩论一样。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah, everybody lives in London or Paris or New York—” said the young man, as if this were an argument.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他对于未知的印第安人那种特别而朦胧的热情在这个女人的心中引起了极强的共鸣。她被一种傻乎乎的浪漫情怀所征服，比少女的还要不真实。她感到命中注定她会陷入对群山里那些永恒、神秘、奇妙的印第安人的秘密思绪之中。</td>
		<td class="en">And his peculiar vague enthusiasm for unknown Indians found a full echo in the woman’s heart.She was overcome by a foolish romanticism more unreal than a girl’s.She felt it was her destiny to wander into the secret haunts of these timeless, mysterious, marvellous Indians of the mountains.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她保守着自己的秘密。那个年轻人要离开了，她的丈夫要和他一道去托雷翁办事——要离开一段日子。不过在离开前，她让丈夫给她讲了讲印第安人：讲游牧部落，这些部落的人很像至今仍在自由游牧的纳瓦霍人，还有索诺拉的雅基族人，以及奇瓦瓦州各个山谷里住着的不同部落。</td>
		<td class="en">She kept her secret.The young man was departing, her husband was going with him down to Torreon, on business:—would be away for some days.But before the departure, she made her husband talk about the Indians: about the wandering tribes, resembling the Navajo, who were still wandering free; and the Yaquis of Sonora: and the different groups in the different valleys of Chihuahua State.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >应该有这么一个部落叫西尔西威部落，生活在南部的大峡谷中，是全印第安人中的神圣部落。摩特祖玛和古阿兹特克的后裔或者托托纳克的国王还和他们住在一起；老祭司们保留着古老的宗教，还保持着人祭的传统——据说是这样。有些科学家去过西尔西威村，由于饱尝饥饿和艰辛，回来时都面容憔悴、疲惫不堪。他们带回了各色古怪的野蛮人崇拜的物件。不过，并没有在这个饥馑荒凉的野蛮人村庄里见到什么特别离奇的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">There was supposed to be one tribe, the Chilchuis, living in a high valley to the south, who were the sacred tribe of all the Indians.The descendants of Montezuma and of the old Aztec or Totonac kings still lived among them, and the old priests still kept up the ancient religion, and offered human sacrifices—so it was said.Some scientists had been to the Chilchui country, and had come back gaunt and exhausted with hunger and bitter privation, bringing various curious, barbaric objects of worship, but having seen nothing extraordinary in the hungry, stark village of savages.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管莱德曼只是随口一讲，但很明显，他谈论古老又神秘的野蛮人时，感受到的是某种粗俗的兴奋。</td>
		<td class="en">Though Lederman talked in this off-hand way, it was obvious he felt some of the vulgar excitement at the idea of ancient and mysterious savages.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们离这里有多远？”她问。</td>
		<td class="en">“How far away are they?” she asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦——骑马三天的路程——穿过库奇提和一个小湖泊，往上走就是。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh—three days on horseback—past Cuchitee and a little lake there is up there.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她丈夫和那个年轻人出发了。女人给自己制订了疯狂的计划。近来，为了改变自己枯燥的生活，她磨着丈夫准许她偶尔和他一起骑在马背上。她从未被准许单独外出过。这里确实不安全，是无法无天的荒蛮之地。</td>
		<td class="en">Her husband and the young man departed.The woman made her crazy plans.Of late, to break the monotony of her life, she had harassed her husband into letting her go riding with him, occasionally, on horseback.She was never allowed to go out alone.The country truly was not safe, lawless and crude.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但她有自己的马，从孩提起，她就梦想着自由自在地徜徉在加州山间。</td>
		<td class="en">But she had her own horse, and she dreamed of being free as she had been as a girl, among the hills of California.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她九岁的女儿当时在五英里外，一个半废弃的西班牙矿区小镇上一家极小的女修道院里。</td>

		<td class="en">“Am I never to be let alone?Not one moment of my life?” she cried, with sudden explosion of energy.And the child, like the servant, shrank into silence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她毫无疑惧地出发了，跨骑着她健壮的杂色马，穿着粗麻骑装，亚麻马裤上套着马裙，白罩衫上配着一条鲜红的领结，头戴黑毡帽。鞍囊里装着食物和装了水的军用水壶，马鞍后面捆了一大张土著人的披毯。她凝视着远处，从家里出发了。曼纽尔和这个小男孩站在门廊目送她离开。她甚至都没有回头向他们挥手告别。</td>
		<td class="en">She set off without a qualm, riding astride on her strong roan horse, and wearing a riding suit of coarse linen, a riding skirt over her linen breeches, a scarlet neck-tie over her white blouse, and a black felt hat on her head.She had food in her saddle-bags, an army canteen with water, and a large, native blanket tied on behind the saddle.Peering into the distance, she set off from her home.Manuel and the little boy stood in the gateway to watch her go.She did not even turn to wave them farewell.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，当她骑了大约一公里后，她没有走大路，而是走了右面的一条小路。这条小路经过陡峭的地区和高大的树木，穿过另一处荒废的矿区，通往另一个山谷。九月里，水在溪涧里自由地流淌，灌满了现已荒废的矿井。她下马去喝了点儿水，也让马饮了水。</td>
		<td class="en">But when she had ridden about a mile, she left the wild road and took a small trail to the right, that led into another valley, over steep places and past great trees, and through another deserted mining-settlement.It was September, the water was running freely in the little stream that had fed the now-abandoned mine.She got down to drink, and let the horse drink too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她看到一些土著人穿过树林，上了斜坡。他们看见她了，正紧紧地盯着她看。她也反过来盯着他们。一共有三个人，两个女人和一个小伙子，正在绕一个大弯儿，以避免离她太近。她毫不在乎。她上了马，马儿一路小跑着向静谧的山谷上奔去，远离银矿，远离所有有矿井踪迹的地方。那里还有一条崎岖不平的小路，穿过岩石和松散的石头，通向远处的山谷。这条小道，她曾经和丈夫骑马走过。除此之外，她知道她必须往南走。</td>
		<td class="en">She saw natives coming through the trees, away up the slope.They had seen her, and were watching her closely.She watched in turn.The three people, two women and a youth, were making a wide detour, so as not to come too close to her.She did not care.Mounting, she trotted ahead up the silent valley, beyond the silver-works, beyond any trace of mining.There was still a rough trail, that led over rocks and loose stones into the valley beyond.This trail she had already ridden, with her husband.Beyond that she knew she must go south.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说来也怪，她并不害怕，尽管这是一个令人害怕的乡村，那沉寂的、看上去要命的山坡，树林里偶尔出现的那些冷漠、多疑、难以捉摸的土著人，还有远处巨大的食腐鸟，像巨型苍蝇一样间或盘旋在某块腐肉、某间牧场主住宅或某排茅舍的上方。</td>
		<td class="en">Curiously she was not afraid, although it was a frightening country, the silent, fatal-seeming mountain-slopes, the occasional distant, suspicious, elusive natives among the trees, the great carrion birds occasionally hovering, like great flies, in the distance, over some carrion or some ranch house or some group of huts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她向上爬着，树木向后退去，小路穿过一个荆棘丛生的低矮灌木丛，上面蔓生着众多蓝色的旋花，间或出现一个粉红色的匍匐植物。然后，这些花木渐渐消失。她接近松树林了。</td>
		<td class="en">As she climbed, the trees shrank and the trail ran through a thorny scrub, that was trailed over with blue convolvulus and an occasional pink creeper.Then these flowers lapsed.She was nearing the pine-trees.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Later, they put a short blue tunic on her and took her to the upper terrace, and presented her to the people.She saw the plaza below her full of dark faces and of glittering eyes.There was no pity: only the curious hard exultance.The people gave a subdued cry when they saw her, and she shuddered.But she hardly cared.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A large drum was slowly pounding, and an old priest was declaring from a housetop.But it was not till noon that a litter came forth, and the people gave that low, animal cry which was so moving.In the sack-like litter sat the old, old cacique, his white hair braided with black braid and large turquoise stones.His face was like a piece of obsidian.He lifted his hand in token, and the litter stopped in front of her.Fixing her with his old eyes, he spoke to her for a few moments, in his hollow voice.No one translated.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Slowly they moved out, and her litter, with its attendance of feathered, lurid, dancing priests, moved after.Everybody danced the tread of the dance-step, even, subtly, the litter-bearers.And out of the plaza they went, past smoking ovens, on the trail to the great cotton-wood trees, that stood like grey-silver lace against the blue sky, bare and exquisite above the snow.The river, diminished, rushed among fangs of ice.The chequer-squares of gardens within fences were all snowy, and the white houses now looked yellowish.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">They were travelling on and on, upwards, across the snow under the trees, past the superb shafts of pale, flaked copper, the rustle and shake and tread of the threading dance, penetrating into the forest, into the mountain.They were following a stream-bed: but the stream was dry, like summer, dried up by the frozenness of the head-waters.There were dark, red-bronze willow bushes with wattles like wild hair, and pallid aspen trees looking like cold flesh against the snow.Then jutting dark rocks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于，她能够分辨出舞者没有再向前移动了。她离鼓声越来越近，像是接近了某种神秘野兽的巢穴。接着她穿过灌木丛，出现在一个奇怪的竞技场中。面对着的是一大堵空心岩壁，它前方的下面悬着一大条下垂的、獠牙般的冰条。冰从上面的悬崖倾泻到这块岩石上，从高空滴下来，然后止住了，几乎要碰到下面的空石头，那下面本来是个水塘。但是，水塘干涸了。</td>
