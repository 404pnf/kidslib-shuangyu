		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我是一名退休的空中机长。也就是说，当我还年轻的时候（不久以前），我是一名热气球驾驶员，在我们周围和我们上方浩瀚的天空中航行。自然这是一个危险的职业，自然我有很多惊心动魄的经历，其中最惊险的，或者至少最紧张的，要数我将要讲述的那次经历了。</td>
		<td class="en">I am a retired captain of the upper sea.That is to say, when I was a younger man (which is not so long ago) I was an aeronaut and navigated that aerial ocean which is all around about us and above us.Naturally it is a hazardous profession, and naturally I have had many thrilling experiences, the most thrilling, or at least the most nerve-racking, being the one I am about to relate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这发生在我从事氢气球飞行工作之前。这些氢气球都是用双层的、有内衬的浸漆丝以及诸如此类的东西制成，适合航行数日，而非仅仅几个小时。“小纳索”（是以很多年前的“大纳索”命名的）是当时我乘坐升空的气球。它是一个中等尺寸、充满热空气的东西，单层厚度，适合一个小时左右的飞行，能够飞到一英里甚至更高的高度。它符合我的需要，因为那时我的表演节目就是要在半英里的高度跳伞，降至游乐园和乡村集市。那时我在奥克兰，加利福尼亚州的一个小镇，整个夏天都在一个有轨电车公司工作。这个公司在城外有一个很大的公园，为其提供噱头当然符合公司的利益，因为这会使得城里人坐上其有轨电车去呼吸一下乡村田园的空气。我的合同要求我每周升空两次，我的表演特别有特点，因为只有我上班的时候能吸引最多的人群。</td>
		<td class="en">It happened before I went in for hydrogen gas balloons, all of varnished silk, doubled and lined, and all that, and fit for voyages of days instead of mere hours.The “Little Nassau” (named after the “Great Nassau” of many years back) was the balloon I was making ascents in at the time.It was a fair-sized, hot-air affair, of single thickness, good for an hour’s flight or so and capable of attaining an altitude of a mile or more.It answered my purpose, for my act at the time was making half-mile parachute jumps at recreation parks and country fairs.I was in Oakland, a California town, filling a summer’s engagement with a street railway company.The company owned a large park outside the city, and of course it was to its interest to provide attractions which would send the townspeople over its line when they went out to get a whiff of country air.My contract called for two ascensions weekly, and my act was an especially taking feature, for it was on my days that the largest crowds were drawn.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在你能理解发生的事情之前，我必须先解释一下关于用来跳伞的热气球的性质。如果你曾经目睹过这样的跳伞，你就会记得降落伞一经割断，气球就会立刻颠倒过来，里面的烟雾和热空气也会放空，降落伞会被拉平，垂直降落，降到地面上。因此整个乡村不会出现追逐一个硕大的废气球长达数英里的情况，由此省去了很多时间和麻烦。这种技巧是通过把长绳末尾的重物系在气球顶端来实现的。驾驶员带着他的降落伞和吊架在气球的下方垂挂着，他要更重些，以保证气球正面朝上。但是当他松手时，附在顶端的重物会立即拖着顶端下落，由于气球的底部是开口的，这样一来，气球就会上升，热空气就会被释放出来。在“小纳索”上实现这个目的的重物是一包沙子。</td>
		<td class="en">Before you can understand what happened, I must first explain a bit about the nature of the hot air balloon which is used for parachute jumping.If you have ever witnessed such a jump, you will remember that directly the parachute was cut loose the balloon turned upside down, emptied itself of its smoke and heated air, flattened out and fell straight down, beating the parachute to the ground.Thus there is no chasing a big deserted bag for miles and miles across the country, and much time, as well as trouble, is thereby saved.This maneuver is accomplished by attaching a weight, at the end of a long rope, to the top of the balloon.The aeronaut, with his parachute and trapeze, hangs to the bottom of the balloon, and, weighing more, keeps it right side down.But when he lets go, the weight attached to the top immediately drags the top down, and the bottom, which is the open mouth, goes up, the heated air pouring out.The weight used for this purpose on the “Little Nassau” was a bag of sand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我记得那天观众出奇得多，警察一直用双手挡着让他们不要靠近。太多的推推搡搡，绳子也因为男人、女人和孩子们带来的压力而凸起来。当我从化妆间走出来的时候，我注意到两个大概分别为14岁和16岁的女孩在绳索外面，一个大约八九岁的小孩在绳索里面。她们抓着他的双手，而他一直在挣扎，兴奋地欢笑着，想挣脱她们。那时我没把这事放在心上——只是小孩子的幼稚把戏，仅此而已；只是鉴于后来发生的事情，这个场景给我留下了清晰的印象。</td>
		<td class="en">On the particular day I have in mind there was an unusually large crowd in attendance, and the police had their hands full keeping the people back.There was much pushing and shoving, and the ropes were bulging with the pressure of men, women and children.As I came down from the dressing room I noticed two girls outside the ropes, of about fourteen and sixteen, and inside the rope a youngster of eight or nine.They were holding him by the hands, and he was struggling, excitedly and half in laughter, to get away from them.I thought nothing of it at the time—just a bit of childish play, no more; and it was only in the light of after events that the scene was impressed vividly upon me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把他们赶出去，乔治！”我冲助理喊道，“我们可不想发生事故。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Keep them cleared out, George!”I called to my assistant.“We don’t want any accidents.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好的，”他回答说，“我会的，查利。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ay,” he answered, “that I will, Charley.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔治·格皮帮助我升空了很多次，正是因为他的冷静、判断力和绝对的可靠性，所以我极其有信心地把我的性命交到他的手上。他的工作就是检查气球的充气，细察关于降落伞的一切是否正常工作。</td>
		<td class="en">George Guppy had helped me in no end of ascents, and because of his coolness, judgment and absolute reliability I had come to trust my life in his hands with the utmost confidence.His business it was to overlook the inflating of the balloon, and to see that everything about the parachute was in perfect working order.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“小纳索”已经充满了气，被几个人用力拉着。降落伞在地面上平躺着，在它那边是吊架。我把大衣丢到一边，站到我的位置上，示意可以升空。如你所知，第一个从地面上的快速升起是很突然的，这时候气球一旦乘风，就会急剧倾侧，恢复平衡所需的时间比一般情况下要长。我向下看着这个熟悉得不能再熟悉的世界正在快速地远离我。有几千人在看，每张脸都安静地向上看着。这沉默令我惊讶，因为这时候拥挤的人群该喘过气来，要爆发出热烈掌声了。但是没有掌声和哨声，只有沉默在呼唤。相反地，乔治的声音，非常清楚地不带丝毫颤抖，通过喇叭传了过来：</td>
		<td class="en">The “Little Nassau” was already filled and straining at the guys.The parachute lay flat along the ground and beyond it the trapeze.I tossed aside my overcoat, took my position, and gave the signal to let go.As you know, the first rush upward from the earth is very sudden, and this time the balloon, when it first caught the wind, heeled violently over and was longer than usual in righting.I looked down at the old familiar sight of the world rushing away from me.And there were the thousands of people, every face silently upturned.And the silence startled me, for, as crowds went, this was the time for them to catch their first breath and send up a roar of applause.But there was no hand-clapping, whistling, cheering-only silence.And instead, clear as a bell and distinct, without the slightest shake or quaver, came George’s voice through the megaphone:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让它下来，查利！让热气球下来！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ride her down, Charley!Ride the balloon down!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >发生了什么事？我挥手示意我听见了他的话，开始琢磨起来。降落伞出问题了吗？为什么我要让气球下去而不是表演几千人正在等着看的跳伞？怎么了？我正困惑时，又一个震惊不期而至。现在距离地面有一千英尺，然而我却听到了一个小孩轻声哭泣的声音，而且似乎离我特别近。虽然“小纳索”正像火箭一般往天上冲，但是哭泣声并没有越来越微弱，然后消失。当我的眼睛下意识地顺着哭泣声传来的地方看的时候，我抬头看见一个男孩跨坐在那个能把“小纳索”带回地面的沙袋上，我承认我几乎吓傻了。他正是我看见和那两个女孩打斗的那个小男孩——后来我才得知，她们是他的姐姐。</td>
		<td class="en">What had happened?I waved my hand to show that I had heard, and began to think.Had something gone wrong with the parachute?Why should I ride the balloon down instead of making the jump which thousands were waiting to see?What was the matter?And as I puzzled, I received another start.The earth was a thousand feet beneath, and yet I heard a child crying softly, and seemingly very close to hand.And though the“ Little Nassau” was shooting skyward like a rocket, the crying did not grow fainter and fainter and die away.I confess I was almost on the edge of a funk, when, unconsciously following up the noise with my eyes, I looked above me and saw a boy astride the sandbag which was to bring the“ Little Nassau” to earth.And it was the same little boy I had seen struggling with the two girls—his sisters, as I afterward learned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他就在那儿，正跨坐在沙袋上，拼命地紧紧抓住绳子。一阵风吹过，气球微微晃了晃，他摇晃着往外移了10或12英尺，接着又荡回去，砰的一声撞到了绷紧的帆布上，这甚至让我都摇晃了一下，气球往下降了至少30英尺。我原以为会看到他因没抓到任何东西而向下猛落，但是他抓紧了，呜咽地哭着。后来他们告诉我，当他们放开气球的时候，那个小家伙挣脱他的姐姐，躲在绳索下面，故意跳上沙袋，跨在上面。他居然没有在第一个冲力中被甩下去，这对我来说一直是一个奇迹。</td>
		<td class="en">There he was, astride the sandbag and holding on to the rope for dear life.A puff of wind heeled the balloon slightly, and he swung out into space for ten or a dozen feet, and back again, fetching up against the tight canvas with a thud which even shook me, thirty feet or more beneath.I thought to see him dashed loose, but he clung on and whimpered.They told me afterward, how, at the moment they were casting off the balloon, the little fellow had torn away from his sisters, ducked under the rope, and deliberately jumped astride the sandbag.It has always been a wonder to me that he was not jerked off in the first rush.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好吧，看着他在那儿时，我浑身感到不舒服。我明白了为什么气球花了那么长的时间才恢复平稳，为什么乔治让我把气球降下来。假如我把降落伞割断，气球就会立刻颠倒过来，排空热气，然后快速下落。唯一的希望就是我把气球降落，而且男孩还得抓得住。我不可能够得到他。没有人能攀上这个又细又封闭的降落伞，即使有人能做到，能够到达气球口，他又能做什么呢？这个男孩在我正上方15英尺的摇晃着的高处挂着，而且这15英尺之间什么都没有。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, I felt sick all over as I looked at him there, and I understood why the balloon had taken longer to right itself, and why George had called after me to ride her down.Should I cut loose with the parachute, the bag would at once turn upside down, empty itself, and begin its swift descent.The only hope lay in my riding her down and in the boy holding on.There was no possible way for me to reach him.No man could climb the slim, closed parachute; and even if a man could, and made the mouth of the balloon, what could he do?Straight out, and fifteen feet away, trailed the boy on his ticklish perch, and those fifteen feet were empty space.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我当时想的比现在讲的快多了，我立即意识到必须把男孩的注意力从他可怕的危险处境上转移开来。我调动起自己所有的自控能力，努力让自己冷静下来，亲切地说道：</td>
		<td class="en">I thought far more quickly than it takes to tell all this, and realized on the instant that the boy’s attention must be called away from his terrible danger.Exercising all the self-control I possessed, and striving to make myself very calm, I said cheerily:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“上面的，你好，你是谁？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hello, up there, who are you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他往下看着我，把眼泪收了回去，露出了高兴的神情，但是，就在那时，气球遇上了逆流，转了半圈，停了下来。这使他来回摇晃，他又撞在帆布上。然后他又开始哭了。“这样不是很棒吗？”我热心地问着，仿佛这是世界上最令人愉快的事情。没等他回答，我又问：“你叫什么名字？”</td>
		<td class="en">He looked down at me, choking back his tears and brightening up, but just then the balloon ran into a cross-current, turned half around and lay over.This set him swinging back and forth, and he fetched the canvas another bump.Then he began to cry again.“Isn’t it great?”I asked heartily, as though it was the most enjoyable thing in the world; and, without waiting for him to answer: “What’s your name?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“汤米·德莫特。”他回答说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Tommy Dermott,” he answered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很高兴认识你，汤米·德莫特。”我继续说，“但是我想知道，是谁说你能跟我一起乘热气球上来的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Glad to make your acquaintance, Tommy Dermott,” I went on.“But I’d like to know who said you could ride up with me?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他笑了，说他乘热气球上来只是觉得好玩。我们就这样继续说着，我心烦意乱，很担心他，同时我也在绞尽脑汁地继续和他交谈。我知道我能做的只有这些，他能否活下来就要看我能否有能力把他的注意力从他危险的处境上引开了。我向他指了指那绵延到天际、4000英尺高空下的壮丽风景。那边的圣弗朗西斯科湾就像一个平静的大湖，整个城市笼罩着一层薄雾，远处的金门海峡、雾气弥漫的海面，以及周围环绕的塔毛利帕斯山，在天空的映衬下轮廓是如此地清晰和分明。在我们正下方，我能看见一辆轻便马车，显然它在慢慢前进，但是以我的经验我知道里面的人在赶着马跟随我们的踪迹。</td>
		<td class="en">He laughed and said he just thought he’d ride up for the fun of it.And so we went on, I sick with fear for him, and cudgeling my brains to keep up the conversation.I knew that it was all I could do, and that his life depended upon my ability to keep his mind off his danger.I pointed out to him the great panorama spreading away to the horizon and four thousand feet beneath us.There lay San Francisco Bay like a great placid lake, the haze of smoke over the city, the Golden Gate, the ocean fog-rim beyond, and Mount Tamalpais over all, clear-cut and sharp against the sky.Directly below us I could see a buggy, apparently crawling, but I knew from experience that the men in it were lashing the horses on our trail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是他厌倦了环顾四周，而且我能看出来他开始感到害怕。</td>
		<td class="en">But he grew tired of looking around, and I could see he was beginning to get frightened.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你愿意从事这项工作吗？”我问。</td>
		<td class="en">“How would you like to go in for the business?” I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他立刻变得愉快起来，问道：“你薪酬高吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">He cheered up at once and asked “Do you get good pay?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是小纳索开始冷却，开始了漫长的下降过程，还遇到了逆流，于是它猛烈地上下颠簸。这使男孩晃得非常剧烈，一度把他重重地撞到了沙袋上。他的嘴唇因此开始发抖，他又哭了起来。我试着说笑话，大笑，但是无济于事。他的勇气在逐渐消失，我随时都准备着看他从我眼前飞落下去。</td>
		<td class="en">But the Little Nassau, beginning to cool, had started on its long descent, and ran into counter currents which bobbed it roughly about.This swung the boy around pretty lively, smashing him into the bag once quite severely.His lip began to tremble at this, and he was crying again.I tried to joke and laugh, but it was no use.His pluck was oozing out, and at any moment I was prepared to see him go shooting past me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我绝望了。接着，我突然想起通过一个恐惧打消另一个恐惧的方法，我冲他皱了皱眉，厉声大喊道：</td>
		<td class="en">I was in despair.Then, suddenly, I remembered how one fright could destroy another fright, and I frowned up at him and shouted sternly:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你只要抓住绳索就行了！如果你不抓住的话，当我把你送到地面上的时候，我会把你打得半死。明白吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You just hold on to that rope!If you don’t I’ll thrash you within an inch of your life when I get you down on the ground!Understand?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好——好——的，先生。”他啜泣着，我知道我说的话奏效了。相比于地面，我距离他更近，所以，相比往下掉，他更害怕我。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ye-ye-yes, sir,” he whimpered, and I saw that the thing had worked.I was nearer to him than the earth, and he was more afraid of me than of falling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，你在那个软软的袋子上已经很舒服了。”我喋喋不休地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, you’ve got a snap up there on that soft bag,” I rattled on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，”我让他放心，“下面这根棒子又硬又窄，坐在上面很痛。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes;” I assured him, “this bar down here is hard and narrow, and it hurts to sit on it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着他突然想起什么，全然忘了自己疼痛的手指。</td>
		<td class="en">Then a thought struck him, and he forgot all about his aching fingers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你什么时候跳伞？”他问，“这才是我到这儿想看的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“When are you going to jump?” he asked.“That’s what I came up to see.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我很抱歉让他失望，可我并不打算跳伞。</td>
		<td class="en">I was sorry to disappoint him, but I wasn’t going to make any jump.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是他反对。“报纸上就是这么说的。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">But he objected to that.“It said so in the papers,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不在乎，”我回答说，“我今天有点儿懒，只是想把气球降落而已。这是我的气球，我想我高兴对它做什么就做什么。总之，我们现在马上要降落了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t care,” I answered.“I’m feeling sort of lazy today, and I’m just going to ride down the balloon.It’s my balloon and I guess I can do as I please about it.And, anyway, we’re almost down now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而且，我们也正在快速下落。</td>
		<td class="en">And we were, too, and sinking fast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >关于我让人们失望是否正确，这个小孩当场就跟我争辩起来，并且强烈要求要我满足他们。我愉快地结束了争辩，用一千种不同的方式为自己辩解，直到我们撞到了桉树丛，下降接触到地面。</td>
		<td class="en">And right there and then that youngster began to argue with me as to whether it was right for me to disappoint the people, and to urge their claims upon me.And it was with a happy heart that I held up my end of it, justifying myself in a thousand different ways, till we shot over a grove of eucalyptus trees and dipped to meet the earth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“抓紧点儿！”我大喊着，借助双手从吊架上摇摇晃晃地下来，这样就可以双脚着地了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hold on tight!”I shouted, swinging down from the trapeze by my hands in order to make a landing on my feet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们掠过了牲口棚，躲开了一堆晾衣绳，吓得牲口棚里的鸡惊慌失措，然后又升起来经过了干草堆——所有的这些发生的比说的还快。然后我们降落到了一个果园里，我的双脚着地时，吊架缠在了一颗苹果树上，我转了几圈才让气球停了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">We skimmed past a barn, missed a mesh of clothesline, frightened the barnyard chickens into a panic, and rose up again clear over a haystack-all this almost quicker than it takes to tell.Then we came down in an orchard, and when my feet had touched the ground I fetched up the balloon by a couple of turns of the trapeze around an apple tree.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的热气球曾在半空中着过火，曾挂在一幢十层房子的檐上，当降落伞还在慢慢打开时，我曾以一颗子弹的速度下降了600英尺。但是当我蹒跚着走向那个毫发未损的男孩，抓住他的手臂时，我感到一阵从未有过的虚弱眩晕。</td>
		<td class="en">I have had my balloon catch fire in mid air, I have hung on the cornice of a ten-story house, I have dropped like a bullet for six hundred feet when a parachute was slow in opening; but never have I felt so weak and faint and sick as when I staggered toward the unscratched boy and gripped him by the arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“汤米·德莫特，”回过来些神时，我说，“汤米·德莫特，我要把你放到我的膝盖上，给你天底下没人经历过的一次毒打。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tommy Dermott,” I said, when I had got my nerves back somewhat.“Tommy Dermott, I’m going to lay you across my knee and give you the greatest thrashing a boy ever got in the world’s history.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，你不能，”他扭来扭去地回答说，“你说过，如果我抓得紧你不会打的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, you don’t,” he answered, squirming around.“You said you wouldn’t if I held on tight.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那好吧，”我说，“但是我会的，就和我说的一样。骑到热气球上面的是坏家伙，是不道德的,我现在要给你个教训，让你远离他们，也远离气球。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s all right,” I said, “but I’m going to, just the same.The fellows who go up in balloons are bad, unprincipled men, and I’m going to give you a lesson right now to make you stay away from them, and from balloons, too.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后我打了他，即便这算不上是世界上最重的痛打，那也是他受过的最重的痛打。</td>
		<td class="en">And then I gave it to him, and if it wasn’t the greatest thrashing in the world, it was the greatest he ever got.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是那次经历让我花尽了全身力气，令我精疲力尽。我取消了有轨电车公司的聘约，从此从事和汽油有关的工作。不管怎么说，汽油更加安全。</td>
		<td class="en">But it took all the grit out of me, left me nerve-broken, that experience.I canceled the engagement with the street railway company, and later on went in for gas.Gas is much the safer, anyway.</td></tr>
