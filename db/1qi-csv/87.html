		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >再也没有圣诞故事可写了。虚构的故事已经用尽，而仅次于它的报刊新闻，是被早早就结了婚的年轻聪明的记者捏造出来的，他们对生活的态度悲观得可爱。因此，为了节日娱乐，我们只好使用两个不靠谱的来源——事实和哲学。我们将用其中之一开始我们的故事——随你怎么称呼它。</td>
		<td class="en">There are no more Christmas stories to write.Fiction is exhausted; and newspaper items, the next best, are manufactured by clever young journalists who have married early and have an engagingly pessimistic view of life.Therefore, for seasonable diversion, we are reduced to very questionable sources—facts and philosophy.We will begin with—whichever you choose to call it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >孩子们像令人厌烦的小动物，我们得在各种手足无措的情况下应对他们。尤其是他们耍小孩子脾气，悲伤不已时，我们就会被弄得束手无策。当我们绞尽脑汁仍不能安慰他们时，就只能打他们一顿，让他们大哭一场，抽泣着入睡。接着，我们匍匐在苍茫大地上，向上帝发问：“为什么会这样？”我们如困兽般绝望地呼喊。除了老女仆、驼背人和牧羊犬之外，没人能理解孩子们。</td>
		<td class="en">Children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope under a bewildering variety of conditions.Especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits’ end.We exhaust our paltry store of consolation; and then beat them, sobbing, to sleep.Then we grovel in the dust of a million years, and ask God why.Thus we call out of the rat-trap.As for the children, no one understands them except old maids, hunchbacks, and shepherd dogs.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Now comes the facts in the case of the Rag-Doll, the Tatterdemalion, and the Twenty-fifth of December.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同月十号，百万富翁孩子的布娃娃丢了。百万富翁的宅第坐落于哈得孙，很多仆人把房子里里外外翻了个遍，还是没找到这个丢失的宝贝。这个小女孩五岁，是众多任性的小怪兽之一，他们经常把注意力放到粗俗廉价的玩具上而无视那些镶有钻石的汽车和敞篷小马车，这着实让他们有钱的父母感到闹心。</td>
		<td class="en">On the tenth of that month the Child of the Millionaire lost her rag-doll.There were many servants in the Millionaire’s palace on the Hudson, and these ransacked the house and grounds, but without finding the lost treasure.The child was a girl of five, and one of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar, inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond-studded automobiles and pony phaetons.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小女孩因宝贝的丢失而着实伤心，这令百万富翁非常费解，他对布娃娃市场就像对马萨诸塞州煤气公司的股票一样并不看好；而孩子的妈妈，举止得体的女主人呢——她几乎是非常得体的，往下看你就知道了。</td>
		<td class="en">The Child grieved sorely and truly, a thing inexplicable to the Millionaire, to whom the rag-doll market was about as interesting as Bay State Gas; and to the Lady, the Child’s mother, who was all form—that is, nearly all, as you shall see.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >孩子整天伤心欲绝地痛哭，眼睛凹陷下去了，打着八字脚连路都走不稳，人瘦得像纺锤似的，在许多别的方面就像科瑞·基尔弗蒂画的那样。百万富翁拍着他的保险箱自信地笑了笑。法国和德国玩具制造商的精选产品通过特快专递火速抵达，但这并没有抚慰雷切尔受伤的心。她依旧为她的布娃娃哭泣，好像支持对所有外国的蠢东西征收高额保护关税。接着，临床态度最好的医生们被邀请来了，还带来了计秒表。他们一个接着一个徒劳无益地聊着养胃补血、安神益脑的药物，或是建议去海上航行来换换环境，直到秒表时间提示他们的钱该到账时，才停止装腔作势。然后，出于成人的理智，他们建议尽快让布娃娃回到它悲痛的小妈妈身边。孩子拒绝治疗，咬着大拇指，哭喊着要她的贝特西。这个时候，圣诞老人发来电报说他很快就会到达，并吩咐我们要展示出真正的基督徒精神，将台球娱乐、汤鼎氏联合养老保险单以及步兵分队制暂且搁置一边，以迎接他的到来。到处都洋溢着圣诞节的气氛。银行停止贷款；当铺助理工人的数量增加了一倍；在街上人们的红色雪橇会时不时碰到你的小腿；你单脚站着等酒时，你面前吧台上的啤酒正冒着泡；商店的橱窗上挂着迎客的冬青枝花环；有裘皮大衣的人穿上了裘皮外套。你几乎不知道哪种球是最好的选择——桌球中的三球，球形高脚酒杯，樟脑球，或者雪球。心肝布娃娃丢得太不是时候了。</td>
		<td class="en">The Child cried inconsolably, and grew hollow-eyed, knock-kneed, spindling, and cory-kilverty in many other respects.The Millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently.The pick of the output of the French and German toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion; but Rachel refused to be comforted.She was weeping for her rag child, and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness.Then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop-watches were called in.One by one they chattered futilely about pepto-manganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop-watches showed that Bill Rendered was under the wire for show or place.Then, as men, they advised that the rag-doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent.The Child sniffed at therapeutics, chewed a thumb, and wailed for her Betsy.And all this time cablegrams were coming from Santa Claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true Christian spirit and let up on the pool-rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome.Everywhere the spirit of Christmas was diffusing itself.The banks were refusing loans, the pawn-brokers had doubled their gang of helpers, people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds, Thomas and Jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot, holly-wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores, they who had ’em were getting their furs.You hardly knew which was the best bet in balls—three, high, moth, or snow.It was no time at which to lose the rag-doll or your heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果沃森医生的侦探朋友被邀请来调查这次的神秘失踪事件，他一定会注意到挂在百万富翁墙上的一幅“吸血鬼”图画仿制品。那会使人快速联想到“破布、骨头和头发”。孩子心目中仅次于布娃娃的苏格兰小猎犬“弗利普”蹦蹦跳跳地穿过大厅。这一卷头发！啊哈！X，这个未知数，代表的正是布娃娃。可骨头会在哪儿呢？好，狗找骨头的时候他们会发现什么呢？——问题解决了！检查弗利普的前爪是件很轻松且富有成效的事情。看，沃森！土——狗爪子缝里有干土。一定是这狗——但福尔摩斯不在这儿。因此问题转移了。但是周围的地形和建筑必需作为参考的因素。</td>
		<td class="en">If Doctor Watson’s investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the Millionaire’s wall a copy of “The Vampire.”That would have quickly suggested, by induction, “A rag and a bone and a hank of hair.”“Flip,” a Scotch terrier, next to the rag-doll in the Child’s heart, frisked through the halls.The hank of hair!Aha! X, the unfound quantity, represented the rag-doll.But, the bone?Well, when dogs find bones they—Done!It were an easy and a fruitful task to examine Flip’s forefeet.Look, Watson!Earth—dried earth between the toes.Of course, the dog—but Sherlock was not there.Therefore it devolves.But topography and architecture must intervene.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >百万富翁的豪宅占地面积很大。房子前面是修剪过的一块儿草坪，草坪的样子就像刮过脸的南爱尔兰男人在两天后又长出来的胡子茬。房子一边面向另一街道的是每一片叶子都修剪过的庭园、车库和马厩。那只苏格兰小狗从育儿室叼走布娃娃，把它拖到草坪的一角，挖了个洞埋起来，就像草草了事的殡葬工那样。疑案就这样解决了，不必给有吗啡瘾的奇才开酬金支票，也不必付给警官五英镑。疲倦的读者们，现在让我们来处理整个事件的核心吧——有关圣诞的故事核心。</td>
		<td class="en">The Millionaire’s palace occupied a lordly space.In front of it was a lawn close-mowed as a South Ireland man’s face two days after a shave.At one side of it, and fronting on another street was a pleasaunce trimmed to a leaf, and the garage and stables.The Scotch pup had ravished the rag-doll from the nursery, dragged it to a corner of the lawn, dug a hole, and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers.There you have the mystery solved, and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard or fi’-pun notes to toss to the sergeant.Then let’s get down to the heart of the thing, tiresome readers—the Christmas heart of the thing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐喝醉了——但不像你我那样一喝醉就闹事，走路摇摇晃晃或胡言乱语，他倒像走霉运的绅士那样得体、举止适当、不寻衅滋事。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy was drunk—not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously, as you or I might get, but decently, appropriately, and inoffensively, as becomes a gentleman down on his luck.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐是个不幸的士兵。马路、干草堆、公园长椅、厨房门口、慈善机构规定的洗过澡才能分配床铺的侮辱人的规矩、能轻易挣得的数量少得可怜的钱和得来不光彩的大城市慷慨救济物——这些都是他生活历史的篇章。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune.The road, the haystack, the park bench, the kitchen door, the bitter round of eleemosynary beds-with-shower-bath-attachment, the petty pickings and ignobly garnered largesse of great cities—these formed the chapters of his history.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐沿着百万富翁房子和庭园外侧的那条街道朝河边走去。他从篱笆一角那不合时宜的“墓穴”上看到了布娃娃贝特西露出的一条腿，像发现了小人国神秘谋杀案的线索一样。他拉出这个受虐待的婴儿，夹在腋下，哼着在安定家庭中成长的布娃娃不应听的流浪汉同胞所唱的马路歌曲继续赶路。幸亏贝特西没有耳朵。还好她除了两个看不到东西的黑圆圈外没有其它眼睛；因为富齐和苏格兰小猎犬的脸像兄弟般相似，没有一个布娃娃的心脏能经受得住两次成为如此可怕怪物的猎物所带来的刺激。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy walked toward the river, down the street that bounded one side of the Millionaire’s house and grounds.He saw a leg of Betsy, the lost rag-doll, protruding, like the clue to a Lilliputian murder mystery, from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence.He dragged forth the maltreated infant, tucked it under his arm, and went on his way crooning a road song of his brethren that no doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should hear.Well for Betsy that she had no ears.And well that she had no eyes save unseeing circles of black; for the faces of Fuzzy and the Scotch terrier were those of brothers, and the heart of no rag-doll could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome monsters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >或许你不知道，格罗根的酒馆就在河流附近，就在富齐所游荡的街道尽头附近。格罗根的酒馆里已经洋溢着圣诞的欢乐气氛。</td>
		<td class="en">Though you may not know it, Grogan’s saloon stands near the river and near the foot of the street down which Fuzzy traveled.In Grogan’s, Christmas cheer was already rampant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐带着他的娃娃走进酒馆。他想，作为太阳神节的滑稽演员或许能从祝酒杯中捞几滴酒喝。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy entered with his doll.He fancied that as a mummer at the feast of Saturn he might earn a few drops from the wassail cup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把贝特西放到吧台上，大声地与她逗趣攀谈，像取悦女朋友似的讲着夸张，谄媚且亲密的话语。周围的游手好闲之辈和酒鬼们觉得这挺滑稽，顿时哄堂大笑。酒吧招待赏给富齐一杯酒。噢，我们当中有很多人带布娃娃来酒吧。</td>
		<td class="en">He set Betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously, seasoning his speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments, as one entertaining his lady friend.The loafers and bibbers around caught the farce of it, and roared.The bartender gave Fuzzy a drink.Oh, many of us carry rag-dolls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“给这位女士也来杯酒？”富齐厚着脸皮建议到，于是另一杯对艺术的捐献下了肚。</td>
		<td class="en">“One for the lady?” suggested Fuzzy impudently, and tucked another contribution to Art beneath his waistcoat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐开始看到贝特西身上可利用的价值。他第一晚的表演就很成功。一个在全镇举行滑稽剧巡回演出的想法出现在他的脑海里。</td>
		<td class="en">He began to see possibilities in Betsy.His first-night had been a success.Visions of a vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >火炉附近坐着一群人，其中有“鸽子”麦卡锡、黑赖利和“一只耳”迈克，他们在顽固的政治选区臭名昭著，把河的左岸搞得乌烟瘴气。他们把一张报纸互相传来传去。每个人用粗壮的食指指出的那条新闻是一则标题为“一百美金酬金”的广告。想要得到酬金的人，必须找回从百万富翁宅第遗失的，走失的或者说失窃的布娃娃。这个过于忠诚的孩子心中的悲痛似乎仍在肆意地蹂躏着她。小猎犬弗利普摇着可笑的胡须在她面前跳跃着，但这也没能转移她的注意力。虽然有一堆来自法国梅布尔和维奥莱特的会走路、会说话、会叫妈妈、会眨眼的布娃娃簇拥着她，但她仍为她的贝特西痛哭。这则广告是最后一招了。</td>
		<td class="en">In a group near the stove sat “Pigeon” McCarthy, Black Riley, and “One-ear” Mike, well and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring district that blackened the left bank of the river.They passed a newspaper back and forth among themselves.The item that each solid and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed “One Hundred Dollars Reward.”To earn it one must return the rag-doll lost, strayed, or stolen from the Millionaire’s mansion.It seemed that grief still ravaged, unchecked, in the bosom of the too faithful Child.Flip, the terrier, capered and shook his absurd whisker before her, powerless to distract.She wailed for her Betsy in the faces of walking, talking, mama-ing, and eye-closing French Mabelles and Violettes.The advertisement was a last resort.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黑赖利从火炉后面绕到富齐身边。</td>
		<td class="en">Black Riley came from behind the stove and approached Fuzzy in his one-sided parabolic way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个圣诞节的滑稽演员激动得面颊发红，他把贝特西一把塞到胳膊下，准备离开去其它地方进行即兴演出。</td>
		<td class="en">The Christmas mummer, flushed with success, had tucked Betsy under his arm, and was about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates elsewhere.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黑赖利操着一口浓重的地方口音对他说：“嘿，老兄，你从哪儿弄到的这个娃娃？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Say, ’Bo,” said Black Riley to him, “where did you cop out dat doll?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个娃娃吗？”富齐问，并且用食指抚摸着贝特西以确定说的就是她。“为什么这么问？这个娃娃是俾路支斯坦皇帝赠予我的。我新港的乡下家里还有700个像这样的娃娃。这个娃娃——”</td>
		<td class="en">“This doll?” asked Fuzzy, touching Betsy with his forefinger to be sure that she was the one referred to.“Why, this doll was presented to me by the Emperor of Beloochistan.I have seven hundred others in my country home in Newport.This doll—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别再逗乐了，”赖利说，“你是在小山岗的房子里偷的或捡的，不过这没关系。如果你想用那破烂儿换五十美分，就赶快拿钱走人。我哥哥正在家里的小孩儿或许想要拿它玩玩。嘿，怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Cheese the funny business,” said Riley.“You swiped it or picked it up at de house on de hill where—but never mind dat.You want to take fifty cents for de rags, and take it quick.Me brother’s kid at home might be wantin’ to play wid it.Hey—what?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他掏出一枚硬币。</td>
		<td class="en">He produced the coin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐满脸酒气，粗野地咯咯笑着。去萨拉·伯恩哈特的经纪人办公室提议抽出一个晚上免除贝特西去塔奇镇文化宫和文学俱乐部的表演吧。你将会听到几乎和富齐一模一样的笑声。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy laughed a gurgling, insolent, alcoholic laugh in his face.Go to the office of Sarah Bernhardt’s manager and propose to him that she be released from a night’s performance to entertain the Tackytown Lyceum and Literary Coterie.You will hear the duplicate of Fuzzy’s laugh.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黑赖利像摔跤运动员那样，用他那蓝莓色的眼睛迅速地打量着富齐。他的手痒痒，想要当一回罗马人，从这个对着天使即兴表演而不自知的滑稽演员手里掳掠来那个布制的萨宾姑娘。但他忍住了。富齐很胖，高大且强壮。三英寸厚的营养良好的脂肪夹在汗衫和裤子之间，靠脏兮兮的亚麻制品抵御冬天的寒风。他衣袖和膝盖上的无数小的圆形皱纹显示出他有着发达的肌肉和强健的骨胳。他的蓝色小眼睛沐浴在利他主义和头脑眩晕的湿润中，他友好地看着你，一副毫不害臊的模样。他留着连鬓胡须，醉醺醺的，又胖得出奇，看着有点害怕。因此，黑赖利没有轻举妄动。</td>
		<td class="en">Black Riley gauged Fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a wrestler does.His hand was itching to play the Roman and wrest the rag Sabine from the extemporaneous merry-andrew who was entertaining an angel unaware.But he refrained.Fuzzy was fat and solid and big.Three inches of well-nourished corporeity, defended from the winter winds by dingy linen, intervened between his vest and trousers.Countless small, circular wrinkles running around his coat-sleeves and knees guaranteed the quality of his bone and muscle.His small, blue eyes, bathed in the moisture of altruism and wooziness, looked upon you kindly, yet without abashment.He was whiskerly, whiskyly, fleshily formidable.So, Black Riley temporized.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“难道你不要拿她换钱吗？”他问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Wot’ll you take for it, den?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“钱，”富齐用沙哑的声音坚定地说，“买不走它。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Money,” said Fuzzy, with husky firmness, “cannot buy her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他正陶醉于艺术家第一次甜蜜的成就感中。他把褪色的沾有泥点的蓝色布娃娃放在吧台上，假装和她谈话。随着赢得的喝彩声他的心起伏跳动，敬赠的免费酒使他喉咙发烫——难道几个臭钱能给他带来这样的成就感吗？你会发现富齐很有个性。</td>
		<td class="en">He was intoxicated with the artist’s first sweet cup of attainment.To set a faded-blue, earth-stained rag-doll on a bar, to hold mimic converse with it, and to find his heart leaping with the sense of plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured in his honor—could base coin buy him from such achievements?You will perceive that Fuzzy had the temperament.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐像一只受过训练的海狮那样迈步走出酒馆，寻找另一家要征服的酒馆。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sea-lion in search of other cafés to conquer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管天色还不算晚，但是灯光犹如深口平底锅里爆炸的玉米花一样开始在城市里闪烁。期盼已久的平安夜初现端倪。几百万人已经为平安夜的庆祝做好了准备。城镇将被映得一片通红。你们自己也已经听到了喇叭声，躲闪着雀跃的狂欢者。</td>
		<td class="en">Though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent, lights were beginning to spangle the city like pop-corn bursting in a deep skillet.Christmas Eve, impatiently expected, was peeping over the brink of the hour.Millions had prepared for its celebration.Towns would be painted red.You, yourself, have heard the horns and dodged the capers of the Saturnalians.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“鸽子”麦卡锡，黑赖利和“一只耳”迈克在格罗根酒馆外进行了一场仓促的谈话。他们都是身材瘦削、脸色苍白的年轻人，虽不是公开的打手，但他们的打斗方式比土耳其人最可怕的打法还要危险。在对阵战中富齐一定能击败他们三个。但在毫无章法的撕斗中，他必败无疑。</td>
		<td class="en">“Pigeon” McCarthy, Black Riley, and “One-ear” Mike held a hasty converse outside Grogan’s.They were narrow-chested, pallid striplings, not fighters in the open, but more dangerous in their ways of warfare than the most terrible of Turks.Fuzzy, in a pitched battle, could have eaten the three of them.In a go-as-you-please encounter he was already doomed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐带着贝特西正进科斯蒂根赌场时，他们追了上来。他们拦住他，把报纸甩到他眼皮底下。富齐识字——并且懂更多。</td>
		<td class="en">They overtook him just as he and Betsy were entering Costigan’s Casino.They deflected him, and shoved the newspaper under his nose.Fuzzy could read—and more.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“100元呢。”富齐若有所思地嘀咕着。</td>
		<td class="en">“A cool hundred,” said Fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“小伙子们，”他说，“你们真够朋友。我去领赏金。表演这一行已不如以前了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Boys,” said he, “you are true friends.I’ll go up and claim the reward.The show business is not what it used to be.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天完全黑了。三人簇拥着他来到百万富翁房子所在的小山脚下。富齐突然恶狠狠地转向他们。</td>
		<td class="en">Night was falling more surely.The three tagged at his sides to the foot of the rise on which stood the Millionaire’s house.There Fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“鸽子”麦卡锡的口袋里揣着一根长八英寸、直径一英寸的煤气管。中间和一端灌了铅。一半用焊锡包裹得紧紧的。作为一名传统的歹徒，黑赖利拿着一根硬头鞭。“一只耳”迈克则戴着一对祖传的铜指虎。</td>
		<td class="en">In “Pigeon” McCarthy’s pocket was a section of one-inch gas-pipe eight inches long.In one end of it and in the middle of it was a lead plug.One-half of it was packed tight with solder.Black Riley carried a slung-shot, being a conventional thug.“One-ear” Mike relied upon a pair of brass knucks—an heirloom in the family.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐走进百万富翁家的大门，沿着曲折的小路朝有柔和亮光的房子入口走去。三个地精恶霸在门口徘徊着，两个守在门的两侧，一个在马路对面。他们胸有成竹地把弄着冰冷的金属和皮革。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy entered the Millionaire’s gate and zigzagged toward the softly glowing entrance of the mansion.The three goblins came up to the gate and lingered—one on each side of it, one beyond the roadway.They fingered their cold metal and leather, confident.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >富齐带着恍惚的神情，傻笑着按响门铃。出于遗传的本能，他伸手去摸右手套的扣子。但他没戴手套，于是尴尬地放下左手。</td>
		<td class="en">Fuzzy rang the door-bell, smiling foolishly and dreamily.An atavistic instinct prompted him to reach for the button of his right glove.But he wore no gloves; so his left hand dropped, embarrassed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >负责开门的势利门仆以前遇到的都是衣冠楚楚的客人，第一眼看到富齐时吃了一惊。但他第二眼瞥到了富齐的通行证，他一定会受欢迎的凭证——在他腋下摇摆的主人女儿丢失的布娃娃。</td>

		<td class="en">Fuzzy stopped at the Millionaire’s door and bethought himself.Like little sprigs of mistletoe on a dead tree, certain living green thoughts and memories began to decorate his confused mind.He was quite drunk, mind you, and the present was beginning to fade.Those wreaths and festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making the great hall gay—where had he seen such things before?Somewhere he had known polished floors and odors of fresh flowers in winter, and—and some one was singing a song in the house that he thought he had heard before.Some one singing and playing a harp.Of course, it was Christmas—Fuzzy though he must have been pretty drunk to have overlooked that.</td></tr>
