"唷！唷！唷！","Yah! Yah! Yah!"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"他是一个狂饮威士忌的苏格兰人，喝威士忌从不加水，每天早上六点他准时喝第一小杯，之后一直到午夜，也就是到他上床睡觉为止，每隔一段时间就会再喝一小杯。他二十四小时内只睡五个小时，在其余的十九个小时中，他都处于醉酒状态，安静而有礼。在乌龙环礁跟他一起度过的八周里，我从没见过他不醉的时候。事实上，他睡觉的时间很少，都没有时间醒酒。那是我曾见过的最优美又平和的常年醉酒状态。","He was a whiskey-guzzling Scotchman, and he downed his whiskey neat, beginning with his first tot punctually at six in the morning, and thereafter repeating it at regular intervals throughout the day till bedtime, which was usually midnight.He slept but five hours out of the twenty-four, and for the remaining nineteen hours he was quietly and decently drunk.During the eight weeks I spent with him on Oolong Atoll, I never saw him draw a sober breath.In fact, his sleep was so short that he never had time to sober up.It was the most beautiful and orderly perennial drunk I have ever observed."
"麦卡利斯特是他的名字。他是一个老人，腿抖得很厉害。他的手像痉挛了一样颤抖，倒威士忌时尤其明显，尽管我知道他从来没有洒过一滴。美拉尼西亚从德属新几内亚延伸到德属所罗门，他在那里住了二十八年，已被那部分世界同化，他会习惯性地说不标准的外国话，叫做“bech-de-mer（法语：海参）”。因此，在跟我的谈话中，“太阳他出来了”意思是日出，“开开他停下”意思是晚饭准备好了，“属于我的肚子走来走去”意思是他的胃里恶心。他是一个小个子男人，一个憔悴的人。他的身体内被烈酒灼烧着，皮肤被骄阳炙烤着。他像一粒煤渣，一个有几分熔渣特征的人，一块还没有完全冷却仍有生气的小渣块，行动时身体不灵活，起步又突然停下，如同一个机器人。一阵狂风就会把他吹走。他体重九十磅。","McAllister was his name.He was an old man, and very shaky on his pins.His hand trembled as with a palsy, especially noticeable when he poured his whiskey, though I never knew him to spill a drop.He had been twenty-eight years in Melanesia, ranging from German New Guinea to the German Solomons, and so thoroughly had he become identified with that portion of the world, that he habitually spoke in that bastard lingo called “bech-de-mer.”Thus, in conversation with me, SUN HE COME UP meant sunrise; KAI-KAI HE STOP meant that dinner was served; and BELLY BELONG ME WALK ABOUT meant that he was sick at his stomach.He was a small man, and a withered one, burned inside and outside by ardent spirits and ardent sun.He was a cinder, a bit of a clinker of a man, a little animated clinker, not yet quite cold, that moved stiffly and by starts and jerks like an automaton.A gust of wind would have blown him away.He weighed ninety pounds."
"但他最厉害的一点就是他统治的能力。乌龙环礁周长一百四十英里。在其环礁湖中，人们可沿罗经航向行驶。岛上居住着五千波利尼西亚人，所有男女都高大健壮，许多人身高六英尺，重达两三百磅。乌龙岛距最近的陆地有两百五十英里。一艘小纵帆船一年到访两次来收购干椰子仁。麦卡利斯特是乌龙岛上唯一的白人，一个小商人，且是个不停地喝酒的酒鬼；他以铁腕统治着乌龙岛和岛上六千野蛮人。他让他们来，他们就来，让他走，他们就走。他们从来没有质疑过他的意愿和裁决。他的脾气很坏，一般只有上了年纪的苏格兰人才会这样，平常还频繁地干涉他们的私事。国王的女儿纽古想嫁给来自环礁岛那头的豪诺，他的父亲同意了，但是麦卡利斯特却说不行，这个婚姻就一直没成功。国王想要从祭司长那里买环礁湖上的一个小岛，麦卡利斯特说不行。国王欠这个公司的债务相当于十八万个椰子的价值，债务还清之前，他不能买别的东西，连买一个椰子的钱都不能花。","But the immense thing about him was the power with which he ruled.Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.One steered by compass course in its lagoon.It was populated by five thousand Polynesians, all strapping men and women, many of them standing six feet in height and weighing a couple of hundred pounds.Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.Twice a year a little schooner called to collect copra.The one white man on Oolong was McAllister, petty trader and unintermittent guzzler; and he ruled Oolong and its six thousand savages with an iron hand.He said come, and they came, go, and they went.They never questioned his will nor judgment.He was cantankerous as only an aged Scotchman can be, and interfered continually in their personal affairs.When Nugu, the king’s daughter, wanted to marry Haunau from the other end of the atoll, her father said yes; but McAllister said no, and the marriage never came off.When the king wanted to buy a certain islet in the lagoon from the chief priest, McAllister said no.The king was in debt to the Company to the tune of 180,000 cocoanuts, and until that was paid he was not to spend a single cocoanut on anything else."
"但是，国王和他的人民并不喜欢麦卡利斯特。事实上，他们非常讨厌他，而且据我所知，全岛居民曾在祭司们的带头下祈祷了三个月，试图诅咒他去死，但是没有成功。他们派去跟着他的恶魔令人畏惧，但因为麦卡利斯特不相信恶魔，所以恶魔对他也无能为力。对常醉酒的苏格兰人来说，任何符号都是没有意义的。他们收集起他嘴唇沾过的食物废料，一个空威士忌酒瓶、一个他喝过的椰子，甚至他的唾沫，对这些东西施加各种各样的妖术。但麦卡利斯特继续活着。他的身体棒极了。他从来没发过烧，也没咳嗽或者感冒过；痢疾回避他；在那种环境下，白人和黑人都患过的恶性溃疡和严重的皮肤病，他却从未被它们纠缠过。他体内一定充满了酒精，抵御了细菌在他身上安家落户。我过去常常猜想，它们一进入弥漫着威士忌气味的范围之中，就会像极小的煤渣如阵雨般那样纷纷坠地了。没有人喜欢他，甚至细菌也不喜欢他，而他只爱威士忌，且仍然活着。","And yet the king and his people did not love McAllister.In truth, they hated him horribly, and, to my knowledge, the whole population, with the priests at the head, tried vainly for three months to pray him to death.The devil-devils they sent after him were awe-inspiring, but since McAllister did not believe in devil-devils, they were without power over him.With drunken Scotchmen all signs fail.They gathered up scraps of food which had touched his lips, an empty whiskey bottle, a cocoanut from which he had drunk, and even his spittle, and performed all kinds of deviltries over them.But McAllister lived on.His health was superb.He never caught fever; nor coughs nor colds; dysentery passed him by; and the malignant ulcers and vile skin diseases that attack blacks and whites alike in that climate never fastened upon him.He must have been so saturated with alcohol as to defy the lodgment of germs.I used to imagine them falling to the ground in showers of microscopic cinders as fast as they entered his whiskey-sodden aura.No one loved him, not even germs, while he loved only whiskey, and still he lived."
"我很困惑。我无法理解六千本地人就这样忍受着那个憔悴矮小的暴君。他没老早就暴卒，真是个奇迹。这里的人不像怯懦的美拉尼西亚人，他们高傲而好战。大墓地里，坟墓的顶端和底端留有过去血腥历史的残存物——鲸脂铲刀、生锈的旧刺刀和短弯刀、铜螺栓、铁质船舵、鱼叉、炸弹火炮，还有很可能是原用以建造鲸油提炼炉的砖头，以及十六世纪生产的证实了有关早期西班牙航海家传说的旧黄铜片。在乌龙岛上遇难的船一艘接一艘。二十多年前，捕鲸船布伦纳戴尔号为修补船只，偶然驶入这个环礁湖，结果全体船员都命丧于此。檀香木商船咖斯凯特的船员有着类似的下场，全都死了。有一艘大的法国三桅帆船图隆号，停在了环礁边，岛民们在与其激烈争斗后，登上这艘船，然后这艘船在利波通道失事了，船长和一小部分水手借着帆船附载的大艇得以逃生。之后，又有西班牙物品的碎片，这些碎片说明了其中一名早期探险家的失败。这些列举出来的船只的一切，都已是历史，将会在“南太平洋航海目录”中被找到。但我知道还有一些没被记录下来的历史。期间，我很困惑，为什么六千原始野蛮人会让一个堕落的苏格兰专制暴君活着。","I was puzzled.I could not understand six thousand natives putting up with that withered shrimp of a tyrant.It was a miracle that he had not died suddenly long since.Unlike the cowardly Melanesians, the people were high-stomached and warlike.In the big graveyard, at head and feet of the graves, were relics of past sanguinary history—blubber-spades, rusty old bayonets and cutlasses, copper bolts, rudder-irons, harpoons, bomb guns, bricks that could have come from nowhere but a whaler’s trying-out furnace, and old brass pieces of the sixteenth century that verified the traditions of the early Spanish navigators.Ship after ship had come to grief on Oolong.Not thirty years before, the whaler BLENNERDALE, running into the lagoon for repair, had been cut off with all hands.In similar fashion had the crew of the GASKET, a sandalwood trader, perished.There was a big French bark, the TOULON, becalmed off the atoll, which the islanders boarded after a sharp tussle and wrecked in the Lipau Passage, the captain and a handful of sailors escaping in the longboat.Then there were the Spanish pieces, which told of the loss of one of the early explorers.All this, of the vessels named, is a matter of history, and is to be found in the SOUTH PACIFIC SAILING DIRECTORY.But that there was other history, unwritten, I was yet to learn.In the meantime I puzzled why six thousand primitive savages let one degenerate Scotch despot live."
"一个炎热的午后，麦卡利斯特和我坐在阳台上眺望环礁湖面，宝石般颜色的湖面简直是奇观。我们背后长约一百码的沙滩上星星点点地种有棕榈树，在沙滩那边，外围的海浪在暗礁上咆哮着。天气极其暖和。我们处于南纬四度的位置上，太阳横穿赤道，几天后继续向南移动，现在就在我们头顶上。一点儿风都没有——连猫掌风都没有。东南信风快要提前结束了，而西北季风还没有开始盛行。","One hot afternoon McAllister and I sat on the veranda looking out over the lagoon, with all its wonder of jeweled colors.At our backs, across the hundred yards of palm-studded sand, the outer surf roared on the reef.It was dreadfully warm.We were in four degree south latitude and the sun was directly overhead, having crossed the Line a few days before on its journey south.There was no wind—not even a catspaw.The season of the southeast trade was drawing to an early close, and the northwest monsoon had not yet begun to blow."
"“他们完全不会跳舞。”麦卡利斯特说。","“They can’t dance worth a damn,” said McAllister."
"我偶然提到玻利尼西亚人的舞蹈要比巴布亚人的好，麦卡利斯特却毫无根据地否认了我的说法，只因他好争吵的性格。但这也不值得争辩，于是我什么都没说。此外，我从没见过乌龙岛人跳舞。","I had happened to mention that the Polynesian dances were superior to the Papuan, and this McAllister had denied, for no other reason than his cantankerousness.But it was too not to argue, and I said nothing.Besides, I had never seen the Oolong people dance."
"“我要向你证明。”他说，同时向那个新汉诺威市黑人男孩招手示意，这男孩是新来的劳工，做厨师和普通房间佣人。“喂，你，小伙子，你告诉国王让他到我这里来。”","“I’ll prove it to you,” he announced, beckoning to the black New Hanover boy, a labor recruit, who served as cook and general house servant.“Hey, you, boy, you tell ’m one fella king come along me.”"
"那男孩离开了，回来的是首相，他心绪不宁，不太自然，喋喋不休地道歉说明。简言之，国王睡着了，不能被打扰。","The boy departed, and back came the prime minister, perturbed, ill at ease, and garrulous with apologetic explanation.In short, the king slept, and was not to be disturbed."
"“国王睡得很香。”是他说的最后一句。","“King he plenty strong fella sleep,” was his final sentence."
"麦卡利斯特非常生气，结果首相不加思考拔腿就跑了回去，和国王一起回来了。他们两个都很高大，尤其是国王，他一定足有六英尺三英寸高。他的相貌有鹰的特性，这种特点通常可以在北美印第安人身上找到。他经过塑造，生来就是统治者。倾听时他眼睛里闪着光，但却完全温顺地遵从麦卡利斯特的命令，从村子里叫来两百个最好的舞者，有男有女。在太阳的炙烤下，他们跳了两个小时，几乎丧命。他们因此不喜欢他，而他不以为意，最后带着辱骂和嘲笑将他们解散。","McAllister was in such a rage that the prime minister incontinently fled, to return with the king himself.They were a magnificent pair, the king especially, who must have been all of six feet three inches in height.His features had the eagle-like quality that is so frequently found in those of the North American Indian.He had been molded and born to rule.His eyes flashed as he listened, but right meekly he obeyed McAllister’s command to fetch a couple of hundred of the best dancers, male and female, in the village.And dance they did, for two mortal hours, under that broiling sun.They did not love him for it, and little he cared, in the end dismissing them with abuse and sneers."
"那些高大野人的卑贱奴性真是令人惊讶。怎么能够这样？他的统治秘诀是什么？随着时间的推移，我越来越来困惑，尽管我不断看到无人对他的统治持有疑议的实例，但却看不到任何线索说明这是如何做到的。","The abject servility of those magnificent savages was terrifying.How could it be?What was the secret of his rule?More and more I puzzled as the days went by, and though I observed perpetual examples of his undisputed sovereignty, never a clew was there as to how it was."
"一天我碰巧提到对没能换得一对漂亮的橘色宝贝螺感到失望。如果这一对在这里值一美分，那在悉尼就得值五磅。我向物主出价两百支香烟，而他坚持要三百支。当我偶然提到这个情况，麦卡利斯特立即派人去找那个物主，从他那里拿走贝壳，转交给我。他允许我只付五十支香烟来买它们。那人接过烟草，似乎为能够如此轻易逃脱惩罚而狂喜。至于我，我决定将来说话不能口无遮拦。我还在仔细思考着麦卡利斯特权力的秘密。","One day I happened to speak of my disappointment in failing to trade for a beautiful pair of orange cowries.The pair was worth five pounds in Sydney if it was worth a cent.I had offered two hundred sticks of tobacco to the owner, who had held out for three hundred.When I casually mentioned the situation, McAllister immediately sent for the man, took the shells from him, and turned them over to me.Fifty sticks were all he permitted me to pay for them.The man accepted the tobacco and seemed overjoyed at getting off so easily.As for me, I resolved to keep a bridle on my tongue in the future.And still I mulled over the secret of McAllister’s power."
"我甚至到了直接问他的程度，但是他所做的一切就只是使个眼色，让自己看上去很有智慧，然后再喝一杯。","I even went to the extent of asking him directly, but all he did was to cock one eye, look wise, and take another drink."
"一天晚上，我和奥蒂外出到环礁湖钓鱼，奥蒂就是宝贝螺遭强取的人。我私下里多给他一百五十支香烟来补偿他，他开始尊重我，几乎到了崇拜的程度，令人稀奇的是，他是一位老人，年龄至少是我的两倍。","One night I was out fishing in the lagoon with Oti, the man who had been mulcted of the cowries.Privily, I had made up to him an additional hundred and fifty sticks, and he had come to regard me with a respect that was almost veneration, which was curious, seeing that he was an old man, twice my age at least."
"“是什么使你们南太平洋岛上的土人都跟黑人小孩似的？”我开始问他。“这个商人就他一个人。你们有足够多的人。你们岛上的土人就像狗一样——都很怕那个商人。他不会吃掉你，伙计。他也没多少牙齿。你们为什么这么害怕？”","“What name you fella kanaka all the same pickaninny?”I began on him.“This fella trader he one fella.You fella kanaka plenty fella too much.You fella kanaka just like ’m dog—plenty fright along that fella trader.He no eat you, fella.He no get ’m teeth along him.What name you too much fright?”"
"“你是不是认为很多岛上土人会杀他？”他问。","“S’pose plenty fella kanaka kill m?” he asked."
"“他就死了，”我反驳道，“很久以前，你们岛上土人杀了很多白人。为什么怕这个白人呢？”","“He die,” I retorted.“You fella kanaka kill ’m plenty fella white man long time before.What name you fright this fella white man?”"
"“是的，我们杀了很多，”他答道，“啊呀！相当多！很久以前。那时，我还太小，有一艘大船停在了外面。没有风。我们很多岛上土人上了独木舟，独木舟也很多，赶上了那艘船。啊呀——我们大打了一仗。两、三个白人拼命射击。而我们无所畏惧。我们并排靠拢，从边上登上船，我们人很多，可能有五十十（五百）个人。一个白人玛丽（女人）是那艘船上的。以前我从来没看到过白人玛丽。不久以后，很多白人都被杀了。有个船长没死。五、六个白人也没死。船长引吭高歌。有个白人还在战斗。有个白人放下小艇。那之后，他们上船离开了。船长将玛丽吊着放下来。之后，他们使劲划船。祖先保佑我，那时他很强壮。他投下一个鱼叉。他将那个鱼叉投向了白人玛丽的一侧。他没有停止。啊呀，他投向玛丽的另一侧。她死了。我没有害怕。很多岛上土人没有畏惧。”","“Yes, we kill ’m plenty,” was his answer.“My word!Any amount!Long time before.One time, me young fella too much, one big fella ship he stop outside.Wind he no blow.Plenty fella kanaka we get ’m canoe, plenty fella canoe, we go catch ’m that fella ship.My word—we catch ’m big fella fight.Two, three white men shoot like hell.We no fright.We come alongside, we go up side, plenty fella, maybe I think fifty-ten (five hundred).One fella white Mary (woman) belong that fella ship.Never before I see ’m white Mary.Bime by plenty white man finish.One fella skipper he no die.Five fella, six fella white man no die.Skipper he sing out.Some fella white man he fight.Some fella white man he lower away boat.After that, all together over the side they go.Skipper he sling white Mary down.After that they washee (row) strong fella plenty too much.Father belong me, that time he strong fella.He throw ’m one fella spear.That fella spear he go in one side that white Mary.He no stop.My word, he go out other side that fella Mary.She finish.Me no fright.Plenty kanaka too much no fright.”"
"老奥蒂的自尊心多少受到了伤害，因为他突然脱去了他的印花短围裙，给我看他身上明显的子弹伤疤。我还没来得及说话，他的鱼线突然跑出来了。他检查一下，努力收线，却发现那条鱼绕着一个珊瑚枝跑来跑去。我让他分心了，因而他向我投来责备的目光，接着他下了船，脚先入水，下去后他就翻倒了，随着鱼线沉到了底。水有十英寻深。随着他的脚把暗淡的磷光搅入朦胧的火光中，我弯下身子看着他的脚的表演，他的脚越来越看不清了。与一个鱼钩和鱼线的价值相比，十英寻，也就是六十英尺，对一个老人来说不算什么。大约五分钟后，尽管不可能再多一分钟，我看到他出来了，泛着白光。他浮出水面，把一条十磅的石斑鱼丢到独木舟里，鱼线和鱼钩完好无损，鱼钩仍然牢牢地被鱼嘴咬着。","Old Oti’s pride had been touched, for he suddenly stripped down his lava-lava and showed me the unmistakable scar of a bullet.Before I could speak, his line ran out suddenly.He checked it and attempted to haul in, but found that the fish had run around a coral branch.Casting a look of reproach at me for having beguiled him from his watchfulness, he went over the side, feet first, turning over after he got under and following his line down to bottom.The water was ten fathoms.I leaned over and watched the play of his feet, growing dim and dimmer, as they stirred the wan phosphorescence into ghostly fires.Ten fathoms—sixty feet—it was nothing to him, an old man, compared with the value of a hook and line.After what seemed five minutes, though it could not have been more than a minute, I saw him flaming whitely upward.He broke surface and dropped a ten pound rock cod into the canoe, the line and hook intact, the latter still fast in the fish’s mouth."
"“那可能，”我说道，没有一点儿自责。“很久以前，你们不害怕。现在，你们非常怕那个商人。”","“It may be,” I said remorselessly.“You no fright long ago.You plenty fright now along that fella trader.”"
"“是的，非常怕。”他承认了，透露出不再考虑这个话题的神情。半个小时里，我们拉出鱼线，又默默地将它们扔出去。小鲨鱼开始咬钩了，每有一个鱼钩不见，我们就收回鱼线，等待鲨鱼们离开。","“Yes, plenty fright,” he confessed, with an air of dismissing the subject.For half an hour we pulled up our lines and flung them out in silence.Then small fish-sharks began to bite, and after losing a hook apiece, we hauled in and waited for the sharks to go their way."
"“我认为你是对的,”奥蒂突然开口说话，“那么你知道我们现在害怕了。”","“I speak you true,” Oti broke into speech, “then you savve we fright now.”"
"我点燃烟斗等着，奥蒂用糟糕且并不标准的外国话给我讲的这个故事，我在这里改成了标准的英语。另外，从讲述的精神和顺序方面来看，这个传说正像从奥蒂的嘴里说出的。","I lighted up my pipe and waited, and the story that Oti told me in atrocious bech-de-mer I here turn into proper English.Otherwise, in spirit and order of narrative, the tale is as it fell from Oti’s lips."
"“那是在我们做了一件让我们非常自豪的事情之后。我们和靠海为生的陌生白人打了很多次仗，我们总是能战胜他们。我们当中有几个人被杀死了，但是和我们在船上找到的成千上万种储存的财富相比，算得了什么呢？然后有一天，可能是二十年或者二十五年前，一艘纵帆船正好通过这个通道，来到了环礁湖。那是有三个桅杆的大纵帆船。船上载有五个白人和大概四十名船员，黑人船员来自新几内亚和新不列颠岛；这艘船是来捕海参的。船从这里穿过环礁湖，在保卢抛锚了，附带的小艇分散到四处，在海滩上扎营熏制海参。他们分开后，力量就变弱了，因为一些人在这里捕海参，一些人在五十英里外保卢的纵帆船上，还有一些人在更远的地方。","“It was after that that we were very proud.We had fought many times with the strange white men who live upon the sea, and always we had beaten them.A few of us were killed, but what was that compared with the stores of wealth of a thousand thousand kinds that we found on the ships?And then one day, maybe twenty years ago, or twenty-five, there came a schooner right through the passage and into the lagoon.It was a large schooner with three masts.She had five white men and maybe forty boat’s crew, black fellows from New Guinea and New Britain; and she had come to fish bêche-de-mer.She lay at anchor across the lagoon from here, at Pauloo, and her boats scattered out everywhere, making camps on the beaches where they cured the bêche-de-mer.This made them weak by dividing them, for those who fished here and those on the schooner at Pauloo were fifty miles apart, and there were others farther away still."
"“我们的国王和首领召开会议，我整个下午和晚上都在围绕环礁湖划船，带话给保卢的居民，我们会在早上袭击捕鱼的营地，他们负责袭击纵帆船。我们这些带话的人，虽然划桨很疲惫，但我们还是参加了进攻。纵帆船上有两个白人，船长和二副，还有六个黑人男孩。我们在岸上抓住了船长和三个男孩，并将他们杀死，但船长用他的两个左轮手枪先杀死了我们的八个人。你知道，我们一起奋战，在附近扭打。","“Our king and headmen held council, and I was one in the canoe that paddled all afternoon and all night across the lagoon, bringing word to the people of Pauloo that in the morning we would attack the fishing camps at the one time and that it was for them to take the schooner.We who brought the word were tired with the paddling, but we took part in the attack.On the schooner were two white men, the skipper and the second mate, with half a dozen black boys.The skipper with three boys we caught on shore and killed, but first eight of us the skipper killed with his two revolvers.We fought close together, you see, at hand grapples."
"我们打斗的声音使二副洞悉了正在发生的事情，他把食物、水和一个帆放到一艘小艇上，小艇很小还不足十二英尺长。我们突然袭击了那艘纵帆船，一千人划着各自的艇分散在环礁湖各个地方。同时，我们吹响海螺壳，唱着战胜的歌曲，用船桨拍打划艇的两侧。一个白人和三个黑人男孩怎么可能跟我们对抗？根本不可能，二副知道这一点。","“The noise of our fighting told the mate what was happening, and he put food and water and a sail in the small dingy, which was so small that it was no more than twelve feet long.We came down upon the schooner, a thousand men, covering the lagoon with our canoes.Also, we were blowing conch shells, singing war songs, and striking the sides of the canoes with our paddles.What chance had one white man and three black boys against us?No chance at all, and the mate knew it."
"“白人是畜牲。我观察他们很久，现在我老了，终于明白了为什么白人把海洋里的所有岛屿都据为己有了。因为他们是畜牲。现在你和我在这个独木舟里。你还只是个小男孩。你还不算知情，虽然每天我告诉你很多你不知道的事。当我是一个黑人小孩时，关于鱼和它们的生活方式，我知道的比你现在知道的要多。我是一个老人，但我游到了环礁湖底，你追不上我。总之，你有什么长处？除了打仗，我什么都不知道了。我从来没看到过你打仗，但我知道你会像你的兄弟们一样勇敢抗争。并且，跟你的兄弟们一样，你是个傻瓜。你不知道什么时候被打败。你会斗争到死，等你被打败时再知道就晚了。","“White men are hell.I have watched them much, and I am an old man now, and I understand at last why the white men have taken to themselves all the islands in the sea.It is because they are hell.Here are you in the canoe with me.You are hardly more than a boy.You are not wise, for each day I tell you many things you do not know.When I was a little pickaninny, I knew more about fish and the ways of fish than you know now.I am an old man, but I swim down to the bottom of the lagoon, and you cannot follow me.What are you good for, anyway?I do not know, except to fight.I have never seen you fight, yet I know that you are like your brothers and that you will fight like hell.Also, you are a fool, like your brothers.You do not know when you are beaten.You will fight until you die, and then it will be too late to know that you are beaten."
"“现在看看这个二副做了什么。追赶他时，船只布满海面，我们吹着海螺，他带着三个黑人男孩，乘着小艇驶离了纵帆船，划向那个通道。瞧，他又犯傻了，因为没有哪个聪明人会乘着那么小的船驶向海面。船的舷侧距水面不足四英寸。二十个划艇在追他，船上载着二百个年轻人。他的黑男孩划出一英寻，我们就划出五英寻。他没任何机会，但他是傻瓜。他拿着步枪在船上站了起来，射击很多次。他不是个好射手，但当我们靠近时，我们当中还是有很多人受伤死掉了。但他仍没有任何机会。","“Now behold what this mate did.As we came down upon him, covering the sea and blowing our conches, he put off from the schooner in the small boat, along with the three black boys, and rowed for the passage.There again he was a fool, for no wise man would put out to sea in so small a boat.The sides of it were not four inches above the water.Twenty canoes went after him, filled with two hundred young men.We paddled five fathoms while his black boys were rowing one fathom.He had no chance, but he was a fool.He stood up in the boat with a rifle, and he shot many times.He was not a good shot, but as we drew close many of us were wounded and killed.But still he had no chance."
"“我记得他一直在吸烟。当我们距他四十英尺远，快速前进时，他扔掉步枪，用雪茄点燃一串炸弹，投向了我们。他点燃一个又一个炸药，快速地将它们投向我们。现在我知道他必须劈开导火线的两端，插入火柴头，因为它们燃烧的太快了。并且，导火线非常短。有时炸药在空中就爆炸了，但大部分都落到了划艇里。每次它们在一个划艇上爆炸，那个划艇就完了。二十个划艇中，有一半被炸得粉碎。我所在的划艇破得厉害，坐在我旁边的两个人也伤得厉害。炸药在他们中间落下。其余的划艇掉头逃跑了。然后那个二副朝我们喊叫着：‘唷！唷！唷！’他再次用步枪射击我们，结果他们逃跑时，很多人都是后背中弹身亡。那几个黑人男孩一直在小艇上，继续划着船。你看，我告诉你实话，那个二副是个畜牲。","“I remember that all the time he was smoking a cigar.When we were forty feet away and coming fast, he dropped the rifle, lighted a stick of dynamite with the cigar, and threw it at us.He lighted another and another, and threw them at us very rapidly, many of them.I know now that he must have split the ends of the fuses and stuck in match heads, because they lighted so quickly.Also, the fuses were very short.Sometimes the dynamite sticks went off in the air, but most of them went off in the canoes.And each time they went off in a canoe, that canoe was finished.Of the twenty canoes, the half were smashed to pieces.The canoe I was in was so smashed, and likewise the two men who sat next to me.The dynamite fell between them.The other canoes turned and ran away.Then that mate yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!’ at us.Also he went at us again with his rifle, so that many were killed through the back as they fled away.And all the time the black boys in the boat went on rowing.You see, I told you true, that mate was hell."
"“那还不是全部。离开纵帆船前，他放火烧了船，整理好所有的火药和炸药，那样它就会同时爆炸。当纵帆船爆炸时，我们有好几百人在船上，从舷边提水，试着扑灭大火。结果我们失去了为之战斗的一切，而且更多的人都死了。有时，甚至现在，我年纪大了，会做恶梦，梦中仍会听到那个二副的呼叫声：‘唷！唷！唷！’他声大如雷，‘唷！唷！唷！’但那个捕鱼营地里的所有人都被杀死了。","“Nor was that all.Before he left the schooner, he set her on fire, and fixed up all the powder and dynamite so that it would go off at one time.There were hundreds of us on board, trying to put out the fire, heaving up water from overside, when the schooner blew up.So that all we had fought for was lost to us, besides many more of us being killed.Sometimes, even now, in my old age, I have bad dreams in which I hear that mate yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!’ In a voice of thunder he yells, Yah! Yah! Yah!’But all those in the fishing camps were killed."
"“那个二副乘着小艇离开了那个通道，我们确定那是他的末路，因为那么小的船载着四个人，怎么可能在海洋里存活？一个月后的一天早上，在两阵暴风雨的间隙，一艘纵帆船驶入我们的通道，在村子前抛锚了。国王和首领们召开了重要会议，同意我们在两三天内袭击那个纵帆船。在此期间，因为友善待人是我们的习俗，所以我们乘着划艇靠近她，带着许多椰子、家禽和猪去交易。但当我们众多划艇停靠旁边，船上的人开始用步枪对我们射击，当我划着离开时，看到了那个乘小艇驶向海洋的二副，他出现在桅杆上，跳着舞呼喊着：‘唷！唷！唷！’","“The mate went out of the passage in his little boat, and that was the end of him we made sure, for how could so small a boat, with four men in it, live on the ocean?A month went by, and then, one morning, between two rain squalls, a schooner sailed in through our passage and dropped anchor before the village.The king and the headmen made big talk, and it was agreed that we would take the schooner in two or three days.In the meantime, as it was our custom always to appear friendly, we went off to her in canoes, bringing strings of cocoanuts, fowls, and pigs, to trade.But when we were alongside, many canoes of us, the men on board began to shoot us with rifles, and as we paddled away I saw the mate who had gone to sea in the little boat spring upon the rail and dance and yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!’"
"“那天下午他们乘着纵帆船的三个小艇登陆，小船上都是白人。他们正穿过村庄，向他们看到的每一个人射击。而且他们也射杀家禽和猪。我们这些没死的人，乘着划艇逃开了，划到了环礁湖里。回头望，我们能看到所有的房子都着火了。傍晚，我们看到很多来自尼黑的划艇，尼黑是东北部靠近尼黑通道的一个村子。他们是所有活下来的人，跟我们一样，他们的村子被穿过尼黑通道的第二艘纵帆船烧光了。","“That afternoon they landed from the schooner in three small boats filled with white men.They went right through the village, shooting every man they saw.Also they shot the fowls and pigs.We who were not killed got away in canoes and paddled out into the lagoon.Looking back, we could see all the houses on fire.Late in the afternoon we saw many canoes coming from Nihi, which is the village near the Nihi Passage in the northeast.They were all that were left, and like us their village had been burned by a second schooner that had come through Nihi Passage."
"“我们在黑暗中继续向西航行到保卢，但是在半夜，我们听到女人们哭号声，然后我们偶然遇到了一大队划艇。他们是保卢所有留下来的人，同样保卢也化为了灰烬，因为第三艘纵帆船穿越了保卢通道。你看，那个二副和他的黑人男孩，没有被淹死。他成功到达了所罗门群岛，在那儿他告诉他的兄弟们我们在乌龙岛的所作所为。他的所有兄弟说他们会来惩罚我们，于是他们就乘着三艘纵帆船来了，我们的三个村子被彻底摧毁了。","“We stood on in the darkness to the westward for Pauloo, but in the middle of the night we heard women wailing and then we ran into a big fleet of canoes.They were all that were left of Pauloo, which likewise was in ashes, for a third schooner had come in through the Pauloo Passage.You see, that mate, with his black boys, had not been drowned.He had made the Solomon Islands, and there told his brothers of what we had done in Oolong.And all his brothers had said they would come and punish us, and there they were in the three schooners, and our three villages were wiped out."
"“我们还能做什么？早上那两艘纵帆船迎着风驶向环礁湖中央的我们。信风才开始吹，他们乘着大量划艇搜索我们。步枪从来没有停过火。我们就像博尼塔前的飞鱼一样分散开了，我们有好多人，大批人通过各种方式逃到了环礁岛边缘的小岛上。","“And what was there for us to do?In the morning the two schooners from windward sailed down upon us in the middle of the lagoon.The trade wind was blowing fresh, and by scores of canoes they ran us down.And the rifles never ceased talking.We scattered like flying fish before the bonita, and there were so many of us that we escaped by thousands, this way and that, to the islands on the rim of the atoll."
"“其后，纵帆船在环礁湖周围追捕我们。夜里我们在他们身边溜过。但第二天，或两三天后，纵帆船会回来，朝环礁湖的另一头搜寻我们。就这样继续着。我们不再数有多少人死去，也记不清多少人死去。真的，我们人多，他们没几个人。但我们能做什么？二十艘划艇载满了人，我在其中一艘上，这些人都不怕死。我们攻击了最小的那个纵帆船。他们成堆地击毙我们。他们向划艇投掷炸药，炸药用完后，他们向我们泼热水。步枪从来没有熄过火。被炸划艇上的人在游走的过程中遭射杀。那个二副在舱顶上下跳着并呼喊着：‘唷！唷！唷！’","“And thereafter the schooners hunted us up and down the lagoon.In the nighttime we slipped past them.But the next day, or in two days or three days, the schooners would be coming back, hunting us toward the other end of the lagoon.And so it went.We no longer counted nor remembered our dead.True, we were many and they were few.But what could we do?I was in one of the twenty canoes filled with men who were not afraid to die.We attacked the smallest schooner.They shot us down in heaps.They threw dynamite into the canoes, and when the dynamite gave out, they threw hot water down upon us.And the rifles never ceased talking.And those whose canoes were smashed were shot as they swam away.And the mate danced up and down upon the cabin top and yelled, “Yah! Yah! Yah!’"
"“每个最小的岛上的每所房屋都被烧光了。没有一头猪或家禽活着。我们的井被死尸污染了，要不然就是用珊瑚岩堆得高高的。在三艘纵帆船来之前，乌龙岛上我们有两万五千人。如今我们有五千人。纵帆船离开后，我们只有三千人，正如你会看到的。","“Every house on every smallest island was burned.Not a pig nor a fowl was left alive.Our wells were defiled with the bodies of the slain, or else heaped high with coral rock.We were twenty-five thousand on Oolong before the three schooners came.Today we are five thousand.After the schooners left, we were but three thousand, as you shall see."
"最后，三艘纵帆船对来回追赶我们失去了兴趣。因此三艘都走了，他们去东北部的尼黑了。然后他们逐步将我们赶到西部。水上他们也有九艘小艇。他们边前行边痛击沿途的每个岛屿。他们日复一日地追赶我们，追赶我们，追赶我们。每天晚上，三艘纵帆船和九只小艇从这边到那边横越环礁湖，警觉地排成一列，那样我们就不能逃回来了。","“At last the three schooners grew tired of chasing us back and forth.So they went, the three of them, to Nihi, in the northeast.And then they drove us steadily to the west.Their nine boats were in the water as well.They beat up every island as they moved along.They drove us, drove us, drove us day by day.And every night the three schooners and the nine boats made a chain of watchfulness that stretched across the lagoon from rim to rim, so that we could not escape back."
"“他们不可能永远以那种方式驱赶我们，因为环礁湖就那么大，最后我们所有活下来的人被赶到西部最后的砂坝上。公海就位于更远处。我们有一万人，占据了整个砂坝，从环礁湖这边到海浪拍打着的另一边。没人能躺下来。没有地方。我们臀对臀肩并肩地站着。他们就那样控制了我们两天，二副会带上索具爬上来嘲笑我们并呼喊，‘唷！唷！唷！’直到我们对一个月前曾经伤害过他或他的纵帆船的事感到非常抱歉为止。我们没有食物，站了两天两夜。小婴儿死了，年老体弱的死了，受伤的死了。最糟糕的是，我们没有水解渴，两天来太阳火辣辣地照晒着我们，没有一点儿阴凉。很多男人和女人费力涉入海里，淹死了，海浪将他们的尸体拍打回沙滩上。来了一群苍蝇。一些人游到纵帆船的船帮处，但他们都被射死了。我们试图在我们状态最好时袭击来捕海参的三桅杆纵帆船，对此我们这些活下来的人感到非常遗憾。","“They could not drive us forever that way, for the lagoon was only so large, and at last all of us that yet lived were driven upon the last sand bank to the west.Beyond lay the open sea.There were ten thousand of us, and we covered the sand bank from the lagoon edge to the pounding surf on the other side.No one could lie down.There was no room.We stood hip to hip and shoulder to shoulder.Two days they kept us there, and the mate would climb up in the rigging to mock us and yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!’ till we were well sorry that we had ever harmed him or his schooner a month before.We had no food, and we stood on our feet two days and nights.The little babies died, and the old and weak died, and the wounded died.And worst of all, we had no water to quench our thirst, and for two days the sun beat down on us, and there was no shade.Many men and women waded out into the ocean and were drowned, the surf casting their bodies back on the beach.And there came a pest of flies.Some men swam to the sides of the schooners, but they were shot to the last one.And we that lived were very sorry that in our pride we tried to take the schooner with the three masts that came to fish for bêche-de-mer."
"“第三天的早上，三艘纵帆船的船长和那个二副乘一个小艇驶来。他们所有人都带着步枪和左轮手枪，谈着话。他们告诉我们，只是因为他们已经厌倦了杀死我们，所以才停手。我们告诉他们，我们很抱歉，再也不会伤害一个白人了，我们把沙子倒在头上，表示投降了。所有女人和孩子开始为水大声哭号，以至于段一时间内没人能听清楚自己在说什么。然后我们得知他们对我们的惩罚。我们必须用椰子仁和海参装满那三艘纵帆船。我们同意了，因为我们需要水，我们的心碎了，我们知道和打起仗来像畜生一般的白人交战，我们像孩子一样。商谈结束时，那个二副站起来嘲笑我们并呼喊着，‘唷！唷！唷！’那之后，我们乘着划艇离开去寻找水源。","“On the morning of the third day came the skippers of the three schooners and that mate in a small boat.They carried rifles, all of them, and revolvers, and they made talk.It was only that they were weary of killing us that they had stopped, they told us.And we told them that we were sorry, that never again would we harm a white man, and in token of our submission we poured sand upon our heads.And all the women and children set up a great wailing for water, so that for some time no man could make himself heard.Then we were told our punishment.We must fill the three schooners with copra and bêche-de-mer.And we agreed, for we wanted water, and our hearts were broken, and we knew that we were children at fighting when we fought with white men who fight like hell.And when all the talk was finished, the mate stood up and mocked us, and yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!’ After that we paddled away in our canoes and sought water."
"“几周来我们辛苦地抓海参并将其腌制，收集椰子将其变为椰子仁。我们在为做错的事情遭受惩罚的时候，乌龙所有岛屿的所有海滩都不分昼夜地有烟雾升起飘向云天。在那些痛苦不堪的日子里，我们所有人的脑子里都被打上了清晰的烙印，明白了伤害一个白人是错误的。","“And for weeks we toiled at catching bêche-de-mer and curing it, in gathering the cocoanuts and turning them into copra.By day and night the smoke rose in clouds from all the beaches of all the islands of Oolong as we paid the penalty of our wrongdoing.For in those days of death it was burned clearly on all our brains that it was very wrong to harm a white man."
"不久，纵帆船载满了椰子仁和海参，而我们的椰子树上都已没椰子了，三个船长和那个二副把我们叫到一起召开了一个重要会议。他们说他们很高兴我们吸取了教训，我们说了无数遍我们很抱歉，不会再那样做了。我们又将沙子倒在了头上。然后船长们说没事了，但是为了表示他们没有忘记我们，他们会派一个我们永远不会忘记的恶棍过来，任何时候我们可能想要伤害一个白人了，我们就总是会记起来。之后，那个二副又一次嘲笑我们并呼喊着，‘唷！唷！唷！’之后我们认为早已死了的我方的六个人从一艘纵帆船上被放到了岸上，然后那些纵帆船扬起帆，穿过通道去所罗门了。”","“By and by, the schooners full of copra and bêche-de-mer and our trees empty of cocoanuts, the three skippers and that mate called us all together for a big talk.And they said they were very glad that we had learned our lesson, and we said for the ten-thousandth time that we were sorry and that we would not do it again.Also, we poured sand upon our heads.Then the skippers said that it was all very well, but just to show us that they did not forget us, they would send a devil-devil that we would never forget and that we would always remember any time we might feel like harming a white man.After that the mate mocked us one more time and yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!’ Then six of our men, whom we thought long dead, were put ashore from one of the schooners, and the schooners hoisted their sails and ran out through the passage for the Solomons."
"“被放到岸上的六个人是继我们之后第一批去抓恶棍而后被船长送回的人。","“The six men who were put ashore were the first to catch the devil-devil the skippers sent back after us.”"
"“一场大病来临了。”我打断了，因为我辨出了这个诡计。纵帆船上有麻疹，六个囚犯被故意接触到它。","“A great sickness came,” I interrupted, for I recognized the trick.The schooner had had measles on board, and the six prisoners had been deliberately exposed to it."
"“是的，一场大病，”奥蒂继续着，“那是一个强大的恶棍。年龄最大的人都从来没听说过类似的病。我们杀死了那些活下来的祭司，因为他们不能制服这个恶棍。疾病蔓延了。我说过我们有一万人臀对臀肩并肩地站在砂坝上。当疾病离我们而去时，只剩三千人还活着。由于我们所有的椰子都被制成了椰子仁，饥荒开始了。","“Yes, a great sickness,” Oti went on.“It was a powerful devil-devil.The oldest man had never heard of the like.Those of our priests that yet lived we killed because they could not overcome the devil-devil.The sickness spread.I have said that there were ten thousand of us that stood hip to hip and shoulder to shoulder on the sandbank.When the sickness left us, there were three thousand yet alive.Also, having made all our cocoanuts into copra, there was a famine."
"“那个商人，”奥蒂总结道，“他非常喜欢污垢。”他喜欢宁静地死去，将肉扣下，让许多变臭。他喜欢的一条狗，一条身上有很多跳蚤的病狗总在他身边。我们怕的不是那个商人。我们害怕因为他是白人。我们相当清楚杀白人没好处。那条病狗兄弟似的跟在他身边，白人喜欢你像畜生一样战斗。我们不怕那个该死的商人。某些时候他让岛上的土人在他身边穿过，岛上的土人想杀死他，岛上的土人认为他是个恶棍，岛上的土人听到那个二副喊道，‘唷！唷！唷！’于是岛上的土人没杀他。”","“That fella trader,” Oti concluded, “he like ’m that much dirt.He like ’m clam he die KAI-KAI (meat) he stop, stink ’m any amount.He like ’m one fella dog, one sick fella dog plenty fleas stop along him.We no fright along that fella trader.We fright because he white man.We savve plenty too much no good kill white man.That one fella sick dog trader he plenty brother stop along him, white men like ’m you fight like hell.We no fright that damn trader.Some time he made kanaka plenty cross along him and kanaka want ’m kill m, kanaka he think devil-devil and kanaka he hear that fella mate sing out, Yah! Yah! Yah!’ and kanaka no kill m.”"
"奥蒂把一片鱿鱼放到鱼钩上做饵，他用牙齿将活着的仍在蠕动的怪物撕裂，鱼钩和鱼饵渗入白色浪花，沉入湖底。","Oti baited his hook with a piece of squid, which he tore with his teeth from the live and squirming monster, and hook and bait sank in white flames to the bottom."
"“鲨鱼转来转去，”他说，“我想我们会抓很多的鱼。”","“Shark walk about he finish,” he said.“I think we catch ’m plenty fella fish.”"
"他的鱼线猛然动了起来。他两手交替迅速地将鱼线拉出，一条喘着气的大石斑鱼落在划艇的甲板上。","His line jerked savagely.He pulled it in rapidly, hand under hand, and landed a big gasping rock cod in the bottom of the canoe."
"“太阳出来了，我去给那个该死的商人送条大鱼做礼物。”奥蒂说。","“Sun he come up, I make ’m that dam fella trader one present big fella fish,” said Oti."
