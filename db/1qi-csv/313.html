		<td class="en">ALTHOUGH Bertha Young was thirty she still had moments like this when she wanted to run instead of walk, to take dancing steps on and off the pavement, to bowl a hoop, to throw something up in the air and catch it again, or to stand still and laugh at—nothing—at nothing, simply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果你也三十岁了，转过你住的那条街的拐角处时，突然感到欣喜若狂——无与伦比的幸福！——仿佛突然间吞下那天下午一片灿烂的阳光，那光在你的胸中燃烧，向你的每个细胞、每根手指和脚趾都散发出一阵火花，你能怎么样呢？……</td>
		<td class="en">What can you do if you are thirty and, turning the corner of your own street, you are overcome, suddenly by a feeling of bliss—absolute bliss!—as though you’d suddenly swallowed a bright piece of that late afternoon sun and it burned in your bosom, sending out a little shower of sparks into every particle, into every finger and toe?...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >噢，除了“陶醉和混乱”，难道你就没有其他方式可以表达这种感受吗？文明社会真是愚蠢啊！如果你必须把这种感受像一把极其极其稀有的提琴一样珍藏在琴盒里，为什么还给你一个身体？</td>
		<td class="en">Oh, is there no way you can express it without being “drunk and disorderly”?How idiotic civilisation is!Why be given a body if you have to keep it shut up in a case like a rare, rare fiddle?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，那个提琴的比喻还不能确切地表达我的意思。”她想着，跑上台阶，在包里摸钥匙——她忘了带了，就像往常一样——于是咔哒咔哒碰响信箱叫开门。“我并不想这样，因为——谢谢你，玛丽”——她走进门厅。“保姆回来了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, that about the fiddle is not quite what I mean,” she thought, running up the steps and feeling in her bag for the key—she’d forgotten it, as usual—and rattling the letter-box.“It’s not what I mean, because—Thank you, Mary”—she went into the hall.“Is nurse back?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was dusky in the dining-room and quite chilly.But all the same Bertha threw off her coat; she could not bear the tight clasp of it another moment, and the cold air fell on her arms.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而她胸中依然有个地方明亮灼热——那阵小火花就从那儿迸发出来。这简直让人难以忍受。她几乎不敢呼吸了，害怕那样会把火扇得更旺，不过还是深深地、深深地吸着气。她几乎不敢照那面冰冷的镜子——但还是照了，镜子里映照出一个容光焕发的女人，微笑着，嘴唇颤动，眼睛又大又黑，那神情似在倾听，等待着什么……神圣的事情发生……她知道那一定会发生的……绝对没错。</td>
		<td class="en">But in her bosom there was still that bright glowing place—that shower of little sparks coming from it.It was almost unbearable.She hardly dared to breathe for fear of fanning it higher, and yet she breathed deeply, deeply.She hardly dared to look into the cold mirror—but she did look, and it gave her back a woman, radiant, with smiling, trembling lips, with big, dark eyes and an air of listening, waiting for something... divine to happen... that she knew must happen... infallibly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛丽用托盘把水果送过来，还拿来一个玻璃碗，一个非常可爱的蓝色盘子，呈现出一种奇妙的光辉，好像那盘子在牛奶里浸泡过一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Mary brought in the fruit on a tray and with it a glass bowl, and a blue dish, very lovely, with a strange sheen on it as though it had been dipped in milk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我打开灯好吗，太太？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Shall I turn on the light, M’m?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不用，谢谢你。我能看清。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, thank you.I can see quite well.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >摆放的水果有橘子，带草莓粉色的苹果，几个黄色的梨，光滑如丝，还有一些覆着一层银白果霜的白葡萄和一大串紫葡萄。这些紫葡萄是她为了与饭厅的新地毯颜色协调才刚刚买的。没错，这听起来有点牵强荒谬，但她确实是因为这个才买的。她在商店时想：“我必须买点紫色的东西，使地毯的颜色与桌上的颜色相配。”而且当时似乎觉得很有道理。</td>
		<td class="en">There were tangerines and apples stained with strawberry pink. Some yellow pears, smooth as silk, some white grapes covered with a silver bloom and a big cluster of purple ones.These last she had bought to tone in with the new dining-room carpet.Yes, that did sound rather far-fetched and absurd, but it was really why she had bought them.She had thought in the shop: “I must have some purple ones to bring the carpet up to the table.”And it had seemed quite sense at the time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她把这些颜色鲜亮、形状圆润的水果摆成两个圆锥形，摆放完毕，站在离桌子远些的地方，看看效果——真是精致极了。因为深色的桌子似乎融进了暗淡的光线里，玻璃盘子和蓝色的碗仿佛浮在空中。这些，当然，以她眼下的心情看，真是美得令人难以置信……她开始笑起来。</td>
		<td class="en">When she had finished with them and had made two pyramids of these bright round shapes, she stood away from the table to get the effect—and it really was most curious.For the dark table seemed to melt into the dusky light and the glass dish and the blue bowl to float in the air.This, of course, in her present mood, was so incredibly beautiful....She began to laugh.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，不行。我太兴奋了。”她抓起包和大衣，跑到楼上的婴儿室。</td>
		<td class="en">“No, no.I’m getting hysterical.”And she seized her bag and coat and ran upstairs to the nursery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >保姆给小贝洗完澡，她正坐在一张矮桌旁，喂小贝吃晚饭。婴儿穿一件白色法兰绒睡袍和一件蓝色羊毛短上衣，纤细的黑头发往上梳起，形成一个逗人发笑的小尖锥。她抬头看见妈妈，开始跳跃起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Nurse sat at a low table giving Little B her supper after her bath.The baby had on a white flannel gown and a blue woollen jacket, and her dark, fine hair was brushed up into a funny little peak.She looked up when she saw her mother and began to jump.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来，宝贝，吃完这点，做个乖女孩。”保姆说。伯莎看到保姆撅嘴的样子，明白这意味着她来婴儿室来得又不是时候。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, my lovey, eat it up like a good girl,” said nurse, setting her lips in a way that Bertha knew, and that meant she had come into the nursery at another wrong moment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她今天乖吗，阿姨？” </td>
		<td class="en">“Has she been good, Nanny?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今天下午她一直都挺讨人喜欢。”保姆小声说。“我们到公园去了，我坐在椅子上，然后我从婴儿车里把她抱出来。一条大狗凑过来，把头靠在我的膝盖上，她就抓住狗耳朵，使劲拽。哎，您要能看到她那样子该多好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“She’s been a little sweet all the afternoon,” whispered Nanny.“We went to the park and I sat down on a chair and took her out of the pram and a big dog came along and put its head on my knee and she clutched its ear, tugged it.Oh, you should have seen her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伯莎想问问，让孩子抓一条陌生的狗的耳朵是否有点危险。不过，她没敢问。她两手垂立，看着她们，像个贫穷的小姑娘站在抱着洋娃娃的富家小姐跟前。</td>
		<td class="en">Bertha wanted to ask if it wasn’t rather dangerous to let her clutch at a strange dog’s ear.But she did not dare to.She stood watching them, her hands by her side, like the poor little girl in front of the rich girl with the doll.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >婴儿又抬起头看她，目不转睛地看着，然后笑了，笑得非常快活，伯莎禁不住大声说：</td>
		<td class="en">The baby looked up at her again, stared, and then smiled so charmingly that Bertha couldn’t help crying:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，阿姨，让我来给她喂饭，你把洗澡的东西收拾好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, Nanny, do let me finish giving her her supper while you put the bath things away.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，太太，她吃饭的时候我们不该换人。”保姆还是那样小声说，“这样会打扰她，她可能会心烦意乱的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, M’m, she oughtn’t to be changed hands while she’s eating,” said Nanny, still whispering.“It unsettles her; it’s very likely to upset her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这多可笑啊。如果非得把孩子放在——不是说像个稀有珍贵的提琴一样放在琴盒里——而是放在另一个女人的怀里，为什么还生个孩子呢？</td>
		<td class="en">How absurd it was.Why have a baby if it has to be kept—not in a case like a rare, rare fiddle—but in another woman’s arms?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，我一定要喂！”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I must!” said she. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >保姆心里很生气，不情愿地把婴儿交给了她。</td>
		<td class="en">Very offended, Nanny handed her over.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那好，吃完饭后别逗她。您知道您爱那样做，太太。事后我可就麻烦了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, don’t excite her after her supper.You know you do, M’m.And I have such a time with her after!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >谢天谢地！保姆拿着浴巾走出了房间。</td>
		<td class="en">Thank heaven!Nanny went out of the room with the bath towels.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在我可把你要回来了，我的小宝贝。”伯莎说，婴儿倚靠着她。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now I’ve got you to myself, my little precious,” said Bertha, as the baby leaned against her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >婴儿高兴地吃着，鼓起嘴唇去接勺子，接着挥动两只小手。她时而抓着勺子不放，时而挥手把伯莎刚舀满的勺子推开，食物撒得四处都是。</td>
		<td class="en">She ate delightfully, holding up her lips for the spoon and then waving her hands.Sometimes she wouldn’t let the spoon go; and sometimes, just as Bertha had filled it, she waved it away to the four winds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >婴儿喝完汤，伯莎转身面对火炉。“乖乖——你真乖！”她一边说，一边亲亲兴高采烈的婴儿。“妈妈喜欢你。妈妈爱你。”</td>
		<td class="en">When the soup was finished Bertha turned round to the fire.“You’re nice—you’re very nice!”“I’m fond of you.I like you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >的确，她太爱小贝了——小家伙俯身向前露出脖子，纤巧的脚趾在炉火的映照下晶莹透亮——那种极端的幸福感又回到她身上，她还是不知道如何表达这种感受——不知拿它怎么办。</td>
		<td class="en">And indeed, she loved Little B so much—her neck as she bent forward, her exquisite toes as they shone transparent in the firelight—that all her feeling of bliss came back again, and again she didn’t know how to express it—what to do with it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您的电话。”保姆得意而归，说着把小贝抱了过来。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re wanted on the telephone,” said Nanny, coming back in triumph and seizing her Little B.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她飞奔而下。是哈里的电话。</td>
		<td class="en">Down she flew.It was Harry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，是你吗，伯莎？听我说。我会晚点到家。我会打的尽快回来，但是，推迟十分钟准备饭——好吗？说好啦？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, is that you, Ber?Look here.I’ll be late.I’ll take a taxi and come along as quickly as I can, but get dinner put back ten minutes—will you?All right?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好，完全可以。噢，哈里！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, perfectly.Oh, Harry!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就这样啦？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她想说什么？没话可说。她只想和他多交流一会儿。她总不能滑稽地大喊：“多么美妙的一天啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">What had she to say?She’d nothing to say.She only wanted to get in touch with him for a moment.She couldn’t absurdly cry: “Hasn’t it been a divine day!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么回事？”电话里突然传来微弱的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is it?” rapped out the little voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没事。一言为定。”伯莎说完挂上话筒，琢磨着，还有什么比文明社会更加荒诞的呢。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nothing.Entendu,” said Bertha, and hung up the receiver, thinking how much more than idiotic civilisation was.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们有客人来吃晚饭。客人有诺曼·奈特夫妇——很有见地的一对——男的正打算开一家戏院，女的很喜欢室内装修。有个年轻小伙，叫埃迪·沃伦，刚刚出版了一本小小的诗集，大家都想邀请他吃饭。还有伯莎“发现”的朋友，名叫珀尔·富尔顿。富尔顿小姐做什么工作，伯莎并不知晓。她们在俱乐部相遇，伯莎一下就喜欢上了她，伯莎总是会喜欢上那些有点奇怪的漂亮女人。</td>
		<td class="en">They had people coming to dinner.The Norman Knights—a very sound couple—he was about to start a theatre, and she was awfully keen on interior decoration, a young man, Eddie Warren, who had just published a little book of poems and whom everybody was asking to dine, and a “find” of Bertha’s called Pearl Fulton.What Miss Fulton did, Bertha didn’t know.They had met at the club and Bertha had fallen in love with her, as she always did fall in love with beautiful women who had something strange about them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >令人不愉快的是，尽管她们常在一块，见过很多次，也真心交流过，但伯莎还是弄不懂她。在某种程度上，富尔顿小姐有着难得的惊人的坦率。不过她有分寸，不会超过那个尺度。</td>
		<td class="en">The provoking thing was that, though they had been about together and met a number of times and really talked, Bertha couldn’t make her out.Up to a certain point Miss Fulton was rarely, wonderfully frank, but the certain point was there, and beyond that she would not go.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有什么事隐藏着呢？哈里说：“没有。”他觉得她有点沉闷,“像所有金发女郎一样冷冰冰的，可能是有点大脑贫血吧。”但是伯莎不同意他的观点，至少现在还没同意。</td>
		<td class="en">Was there anything beyond it?Harry said “No.”Voted her dullish, and “cold like all blonde women, with a touch, perhaps, of anaemia of the brain.”But Bertha wouldn’t agree with him; not yet, at any rate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，她那种坐姿，头侧向一边，面带微笑，背后一定有事。哈里，我一定要弄清楚那到底是什么事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, the way she has of sitting with her head a little on one side, and smiling, has something behind it, Harry, and I must find out what that something is.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很可能就是胃口好饭量大。”哈里回答。</td>
		<td class="en">“Most likely it’s a good stomach,” answered Harry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他顺着伯莎的意思作出类似的回答……“肝冻伤了，我亲爱的”，或者“纯粹胀气”，或者“肾病”等等。</td>
		<td class="en">He made a point of catching Bertha’s heels with replies of that kind... “liver frozen, my dear girl,” or “pure flatulence,” or “kidney disease,”… and so on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >出于某种奇怪的原因，伯莎喜欢他这样，而且可以说对他这点非常赞赏。</td>
		<td class="en">For some strange reason Bertha liked this, and almost admired it in him very much.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她走进客厅，生了火；接着，把玛丽细心摆放好的坐垫一一拎起，又把它们扔回到椅子和长沙发上。这下就大不相同了，屋里立刻有了生气。她正准备把最后一个垫子扔出去，突然激动地、紧紧地抱住了它，让她自己都大吃一惊。但是这并没扑灭她心中的那团火。哎，正好相反！</td>
		<td class="en">She went into the drawing-room and lighted the fire; then, picking up the cushions, one by one, that Mary had disposed so carefully, she threw them back on to the chairs and the couches.That made all the difference; the room came alive at once.As she was about to throw the last one she surprised herself by suddenly hugging it to her, passionately, passionately.But it did not put out the fire in her bosom.Oh, on the contrary!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >客厅的窗户通着阳台，在阳台上可以俯瞰花园。尽头靠墙的地方，有一棵高大、细长的梨树，花儿正开得繁盛；它亭亭玉立，在浅绿色的天空衬托下，仿佛静止不动。尽管望过去距离很远，伯莎还是情不自禁地认为那树上既没有一个花蕾，也没有一片凋落的花瓣。在下面花园的花坛里，开着红色和黄色的郁金香，花朵沉甸甸的，似乎在倚着暮色开放。一只灰猫拖着肚子从草坪爬过，另一只与它形影不离的黑猫尾随其后。看到它们那么专注，那么敏捷，伯莎不禁好奇地颤动了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">The windows of the drawing-room opened on to a balcony overlooking the garden.At the far end, against the wall, there was a tall, slender pear tree in fullest, richest bloom; it stood perfect, as though becalmed against the jade-green sky.Bertha couldn’t help feeling, even from this distance, that it had not a single bud or a faded petal.Down below, in the garden beds, the red and yellow tulips, heavy with flowers, seemed to lean upon the dusk.A grey cat, dragging its belly, crept across the lawn, and a black one, its shadow, trailed after.The sight of them, so intent and so quick, gave Bertha a curious shiver.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“猫是多么恐怖的动物啊！”她结结巴巴地说着，转身离开窗户，开始来回踱步……</td>
		<td class="en">“What creepy things cats are!” she stammered, and she turned away from the window and began walking up and down....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在温暖的房间里，黄水仙散发的香味是那么浓烈。太浓啦？噢，不浓。可是，仿佛被花香熏倒了似的，她突然倒在沙发上，用手蒙住眼睛。</td>
		<td class="en">How strong the jonquils smelled in the warm room.Too strong?Oh, no.And yet, as though overcome, she flung down on a couch and pressed her hands to her eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我太幸福——太幸福了！”她低语。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m too happy—too happy!” she murmured.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她似乎透过自己的眼帘看到了那棵惹人喜爱的梨树，满树花儿盛开，象征着她自己的生命。</td>
		<td class="en">And she seemed to see on her eyelids the lovely pear tree with its wide open blossoms as a symbol of her own life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >的确——的确——她已拥有一切。她年轻。哈里和她还像从前那样相爱，他们琴瑟和谐，真是一对好伴侣。她有一个讨人喜欢的小宝贝。他们不必担心钱的问题。他们的住宅和花园也绝对令人满意。还有朋友们——时尚、令人激动的朋友，他们中有作家、画家、诗人，或者热衷于社会问题的人士——正是他们想要结交的那种类型的朋友。他们还有书和音乐；她还找到一个手艺极佳的小裁缝；夏天他们要去国外；他们的新厨师做的鸡蛋饼好吃极了……</td>
		<td class="en">Really—really—she had everything.She was young.Harry and she were as much in love as ever, and they got on together splendidly and were really good pals.She had an adorable baby.They didn’t have to worry about money.They had this absolutely satisfactory house and garden.And friends—modern, thrilling friends, writers and painters and poets or people keen on social questions—just the kind of friends they wanted.And then there were books, and there was music, and she had found a wonderful little dressmaker, and they were going abroad in the summer, and their new cook made the most superb omelettes....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我真可笑。真可笑！”她坐了起来，但是感觉有点眩晕，像喝醉了酒。肯定是春天的缘故。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m absurd.Absurd!”She sat up; but she felt quite dizzy, quite drunk.It must have been the spring.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >是的，是春天了。现在，她觉得好累，连爬上楼去换衣服的力气都没啦。</td>
		<td class="en">Yes, it was the spring.Now she was so tired she could not drag herself upstairs to dress.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >穿一件白色礼服，戴一串翡翠珠链，配绿色的鞋子和袜子。这也不算刻意打扮。她站在客厅窗口几个小时之前就想到这身搭配了。</td>
		<td class="en">A white dress, a string of jade beads, green shoes and stockings.It wasn’t intentional.She had thought of this scheme hours before she stood at the drawing-room window.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她走进客厅，花瓣式的裙摆发出柔和的沙沙声。她吻了一下诺曼·奈特太太，这位太太正在脱下一件非常有趣的橘色大衣，底边和前身上面印着一排黑色的猴子。</td>
		<td class="en">Her petals rustled softly into the hall, and she kissed Mrs. Norman Knight, who was taking off the most amusing orange coat with a procession of black monkeys round the hem and up the fronts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“……哎呀！哎呀！中产阶级怎么就那么庸俗呢——完全没有一点幽默感！亲爱的，我能来到这儿纯属侥幸——幸亏有诺曼的保护。因为我身上这些可爱的猴子惹得火车上的人都很心烦，有一个男人竟然瞪着眼睛，几乎要把我吃掉。既不笑——也不觉得好笑——我还真希望他能笑能乐呢。不过，他并没那么做，他就那么盯着我——我彻底被烦死了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“... Why!Why!Why is the middle-class so stodgy—so utterly without a sense of humour!My dear, it’s only by a fluke that I am here at all—Norman being the protective fluke.For my darling monkeys so upset the train that it rose to a man and simply ate me with its eyes.Didn’t laugh—wasn’t amused—that I should have loved.No, just stared—and bored me through and through.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“But the cream of it was,” said Norman, pressing a large tortoiseshell-rimmed monocle into his eye, “you don’t mind me telling this, Face, do you?”(In their home and among their friends they called each other Face and Mug.) “The cream of it was when she, being full fed, turned to the woman beside her and said: ‘Haven’t you ever seen a monkey before?’”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Oh, yes!”Mrs. Norman Knight joined in the laughter.“Wasn’t that too absolutely creamy?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >更好笑的是，现在她脱了大衣，看起来还真像一个非常聪明的猴子——甚至她那黄色的丝绸礼服也像剥下来的香蕉皮做的。还有她那对琥珀耳坠，晃来晃去的就像两个小巧可爱的果仁。</td>
		<td class="en">And a funnier thing still was that now her coat was off she did look like a very intelligent monkey—who had even made that yellow silk dress out of scraped banana skins.And her amber ear-rings: they were like little dangling nuts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是一个悲凉的、令人忧愁的秋天！”“鬼脸”说着，停在小贝的儿童车前。“当那辆儿童车推进客厅时——”他挥挥手，没把剩下的半句引言说完。</td>
