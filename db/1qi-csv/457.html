		<td class="en">Antwerp To Boom</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们在安特卫普码头引起了一阵不小的骚动。一名码头装卸工和许多脚夫抬起两艘小艇，跑着将它们送下水。一群孩子跟在后面欢呼。“西格雷特”号扑通一声下了水，划开水面，激起一片泡沫。“阿瑞托莎”号也紧随其后出发了。一艘汽船正从上游驶来，坐在明轮罩上的船员声嘶力竭地呼喊，发出警告，那名装卸工和他的脚夫们也在码头上大声疾呼。只划了一两下，我们的小艇便驶离码头，到了斯凯尔特河中央，把所有的汽船、码头装卸工和沿岸的浮华虚幻都抛在了身后。</td>
		<td class="en">We made a great stir in Antwerp1 Docks. A stevedore and a lot of dock porters took up the two canoes, and ran with them for the slip. A crowd of children followed cheering. The Cigarette went off in a splash and a bubble of small breaking water. Next moment the Arethusa was after her. A steamer was coming down, men on the paddle-box shouted hoarse warnings, the stevedore and his porters were bawling from the quay. But in a stroke or two the canoes were away out in the middle of the Scheldt2, and all steamers, and stevedores, and other ‘long-shore vanities were left behind. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阳光明媚，潮水上涨——我们的船以每小时四英里的速度快活地前进着，风速平稳，偶尔有阵急风。就我而言，我平生从未坐小艇航行过，如今第一次在大河中央航行，要说没点心惊胆战的感觉是不可能的。第一阵风扬起我的小帆时会是什么感觉呢？我想这一定和前往未知地带探险差不多，或是像出版一本处女作，亦或如同结婚。不过我的疑虑并未持续太长时间，五分钟后，我已经拉紧了帆脚索，你最好不要对此大惊小怪。</td>
		<td class="en">The sun shone brightly; the tide was making—four jolly miles an hour; the wind blew steadily, with occasional squalls. For my part, I had never been in a canoe under sail in my life; and my first experiment out in the middle of this big river was not made without some trepidation. What would happen when the wind first caught my little canvas? I suppose it was almost as trying a venture into the regions of the unknown as to publish a first book, or to marry. But my doubts were not of long duration; and in five minutes you will not be surprised to learn that I had tied my sheet. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我承认面对这样的情形自己有点不知所措。当然，和其他同伴出行时，我总是将帆船的帆脚索扣牢。但坐在像小艇这样又小又容易颠覆的玩意儿上，面对来势凶猛的阵阵狂风，我却一反以往惯例；而这也触发了我一些玩世不恭的念头。扣牢帆脚索后再吸烟当然要容易的多；但这之前，我从未在衡量显而易见的风险时考虑过舒舒服服地吸一斗烟，并严肃地决定还是抽斗烟。在亲身体验之前，我们无法给出答案——这是老生常谈。但我们常常会发现自己超乎想象的勇敢和优秀—这种感想并不普遍，但肯定更抚慰人心。我相信人人都有这样的经历：但出于担心自己将来可能辜负自己的期望，人们不敢到处宣扬这一振奋人心的看法。我多么希望在我年轻时有人能给我生活的勇气，告诉我危险如何越远观之，越为凶险，告诉我一个人的良知如何得以出淤泥而不染，且在需要之时很少或绝不离开他，这样就能省去我诸多麻烦。但我们都赞同在文学上轻轻吹奏柔情的长笛，却没有一个人会走到队伍的前头去擂响激昂的战鼓。</td>
		<td class="en">I own I was a little struck by this circumstance myself; of course, in company with the rest of my fellow-men, I had always tied the sheet in a sailing-boat; but in so little and crank a concern as a canoe, and with these charging squalls, I was not prepared to find myself follow the same principle; and it inspired me with some contemptuous views of our regard for life. It is certainly easier to smoke with the sheet fastened; but I had never before weighed a comfortable pipe of tobacco against an obvious risk, and gravely elected for the comfortable pipe. It is a commonplace, that we cannot answer for ourselves before we have been tried. But it is not so common a reflection, and surely more consoling, that we usually find ourselves a great deal braver and better than we thought. I believe this is every one’s experience: but an apprehension that they may belie themselves in the future prevents mankind from trumpeting this cheerful sentiment abroad. I wish sincerely, for it would have saved me much trouble, there had been some one to put me in a good heart about life when I was younger; to tell me how dangers are most portentous on a distant sight; and how the good in a man’s spirit will not suffer itself to be overlaid, and rarely or never deserts him in the hour of need. But we are all for tootling on the sentimental flute in literature; and not a man among us will go to the head of the march to sound the heady drums. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >河上风景宜人。一两艘驳船载着干草经过。芦苇和柳树装点着河流；牛群和一些灰色的老马来到岸边，低下它们柔顺的头喝水。岸边树丛中不时出现美丽的村庄和繁忙的船坞，草地上也到处可见一幢幢乡村别墅。我们顺风航行到斯凯尔特河，接着上了鲁佩尔河。我们正无忧无虑地前行，然后开始可以看到布姆的砖厂了，在右岸排了很长一列。左岸依然绿意盎然，一派田园风光。河堤上绿树成径，到处可见一段段用作渡口的台阶，有时上面会坐着一名妇女，手肘支在膝上；亦或坐着一位年老的绅士，手拄拐杖，戴着银边眼镜。但越往前走，布姆和它的砖厂就显得更加灰暗和破旧；直到看到一座气势宏伟的时钟高悬教堂，一座跨越河流的木桥，我们这才知道已到了这座城镇的中心地段了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was agreeable upon the river. A barge or two went past laden with hay. Reeds and willows bordered the stream; and cattle and grey venerable horses came and hung their mild heads over the embankment. Here and there was a pleasant village among trees, with a noisy shipping-yard; here and there a villa in a lawn. The wind served us well up the Scheldt and thereafter up the Rupel; and we were running pretty free when we began to sight the brickyards of Boom, lying for a long way on the right bank of the river. The left bank was still green and pastoral, with alleys of trees along the embankment, and here and there a flight of steps to serve a ferry, where perhaps there sat a woman with her elbows on her knees, or an old gentleman with a staff and silver spectacles. But Boom and its brickyards grew smokier and shabbier with every minute; until a great church with a clock, and a wooden bridge over the river, indicated the central quarters of the town. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >布姆并不是个迷人的地方，只有一件事值得一提：大多数居民私底下都认为自己能讲英语，但事实并非如此。这使得我们之间的交流有点含混不清。至于航海酒店，我认为是布姆最糟糕的地方了。它自夸有一间铺沙的会客室：其中一头有个酒吧，正对着街道；另一头是铺沙的客厅，较先前那个阴冷些。屋里有一只空鸟笼和一个仅做装饰之用的三色旗捐款箱。在这里，我们凑合着和三个沉默寡言的工程师学徒、一个缄默的行商一起用餐。食物嘛，就像通常会在比利时吃到的那样，就是一般酒席上那种；实际上，在与这些可爱的居民相处时我从未觉察出食物有什么与众不同之处；他们似乎整天以业余美食家的精神啄食和品玩着各种食物：似为法国式的，实则德国式的，或介乎两者之间。</td>
		<td class="en">Boom is not a nice place, and is only remarkable for one thing: that the majority of the inhabitants have a private opinion that they can speak English, which is not justified by fact. This gave a kind of haziness to our intercourse. As for the Hotel de la Navigation, I think it is the worst feature of the place. It boasts of a sanded parlour, with a bar at one end, looking on the street; and another sanded parlour, darker and colder, with an empty bird-cage and a tricolour3 subscription box by way of sole adornment, where we made shift to dine in the company of three uncommunicative engineer apprentices and a silent bagman. The food, as usual in Belgium, was of a nondescript occasional character; indeed I have never been able to detect anything in the nature of a meal among this pleasing people; they seem to peck and trifle with viands all day long in an amateur spirit: tentatively French, truly German, and somehow falling between the two. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个空鸟笼被收拾的干净、漂亮，却没有了昔日爱鸟啼声婉转的踪迹，只是有两根分开的铁丝夹着一块糖，颇有点祭奠的意味。那三个工程师学徒不想和我们攀谈，和那个行商也没什么聊的，只是彼此之间低声交谈，出言谨慎，有时借着煤气灯光扫我们一眼，他们眼镜片的反光便随之闪一下。虽然这几个家伙外表俊朗，但他们都“戴着藤壶壳”（苏格兰语）。</td>
		<td class="en">The empty birdcage, swept and garnished, and with no trace of the old piping favourite, save where two wires had been pushed apart to hold its lump of sugar, carried with it a sort of graveyard cheer. The engineer apprentices would have nothing to say to us, nor indeed to the bagman; but talked low and sparingly to one another, or raked us in the gaslight with a gleam of spectacles. For though handsome lads, they were all (in the Scots phrase) barnacled. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >酒店里有个来自英格兰的女工，她离开英格兰已有相当长一段时间，学会了各种有趣的异域习语和古怪的行事方式，在此就无需赘述了。她用行话很流利地和我们聊天，问及时下英格兰的风俗习惯，而在我们试图回答时，又热心地纠正我们。但由于我们是在和一个女人打交道，或许我们提供的信息不像表面上那样被弃之不顾。女人喜欢打探消息，同时又保持其优越感。这是个明智的办法，在这种情形下也差不多是必需的。如果男人发现一个女人钦佩他，即使仅仅因为他精通地理，他也会立即得意忘形。美女们只有持续不断地冷落我们，才能让我们老老实实地呆着不动。正如豪小姐或哈洛小姐所说，男人“就是爱得寸进尺”。就我而言，我全身心站在女性一边；仅次于一对婚姻幸福的夫妇，人世间最美丽的莫过于狩猎女神的神话。男人逃往山林是没用的；我们知道有这么个人；很久以前圣安东尼就试过这种方法，但据说过得惨不忍睹。但却有一些这样的女性，胜过男人中最杰出的天衣派信徒，她们自力更生，没有男人的支持亦能行走于高寒地带。我声明我绝非不食人间烟火，但令我倾心的并非是芸芸女子那情不自禁的绵绵之吻，而是这类女子崇高的理想境界。没有什么比自力更生的景象更鼓舞人心的了。当我想象苗条可爱的少女随着狄安娜号角的曲调在林中彻夜奔跑，想象如她们一样无拘无束地穿梭于老橡树之间，想象森林中的事物和不受男人那炽热的、混浊的生活所影响的星光——尽管还有许多其他理想值得我追寻——一想到此，我就怦然心动。这是生活中的失败，但失败得如此优雅！没有后悔，失足也就无从谈起。同样——这里自然要提到男人——如不需克服这种蔑视，何来鼓舞人心的爱情之光？</td>
		<td class="en">There was an English maid in the hotel, who had been long enough out of England to pick up all sorts of funny foreign idioms, and all sorts of curious foreign ways, which need not here be specified. She spoke to us very fluently in her jargon, asked us information as to the manners of the present day in England, and obligingly corrected us when we attempted to answer. But as we were dealing with a woman, perhaps our information was not so much thrown away as it appeared. The sex likes to pick up knowledge and yet preserve its superiority. It is good policy, and almost necessary in the circumstances. If a man finds a woman admire him, were it only for his acquaintance with geography, he will begin at once to build upon the admiration. It is only by unintermittent snubbing that the pretty ones can keep us in our place. Men, as Miss Howe or Miss Harlowe4 would have said, “are such encroachers”. For my part, I am body and soul with the women; and after a well-married couple, there is nothing so beautiful in the world as the myth of the divine huntress5. It is no use for a man to take to the woods; we know him; St. Anthony6 tried the same thing long ago, and had a pitiful time of it by all accounts. But there is this about some women, which overtops the best gymnosophist7 among men, that they suffice to themselves, and can walk in a high and cold zone without the countenance of any trousered being. I declare, although the reverse of a professed ascetic, I am more obliged to women for this ideal than I should be to the majority of them, or indeed to any but one, for a spontaneous kiss. There is nothing so encouraging as the spectacle of self-sufficiency. And when I think of the slim and lovely maidens, running the woods all night to the note of Diana’s horn; moving among the old oaks, as fancy-free as they; things of the forest and the starlight, not touched by the commotion of man’s hot and turbid life—although there are plenty other ideals that I should prefer—I find my heart beat at the thought of this one. ‘Tis to fail in life, but to fail with what a grace! That is not lost which is not regretted. And where—here slips out the male—where would be much of the glory of inspiring love, if there were no contempt to overcome?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">On The Willebroek Canal </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天一早，我们从维勒布鲁克运河出发时，下起了大雨，寒气逼人。运河的水温与饮茶的温度差不多；冷雨下，河面上覆盖着一层水气。尽管雨下个不停，但并没对我们造成太大影响。我们还是怀着愉快的心情启程了，每划一次桨，小艇都能很轻松地前行。乌云散去，太阳又探出头来时，我们已不再是那种“还不如呆在家”的心情了。和风阵阵，穿过运河边排排树木，吹起层层树叶，在阳光下摇曳生姿，忽明忽暗。看天色，听风声，这似乎是个适于航行的天气。但风吹过两岸间，吹到我们身上时，则变得微弱并且断断续续，无力推进小艇。航行速度时快时慢，不尽如人意。纤道上一个爱开玩笑的老船夫向我们吆喝道：“你们速度很快，但路还远着呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">Next morning, when we set forth on the Willebroek Canal, the rain began heavy and chill. The water of the canal stood at about the drinking temperature of tea; and under this cold aspersion, the surface was covered with steam. The exhilaration of departure, and the easy motion of the boats under each stroke of the paddles, supported us through this misfortune while it lasted; and when the cloud passed and the sun came out again, our spirits went up above the range of stay-athome humours. A good breeze rustled and shivered in the rows of trees that bordered the canal. The leaves flickered in and out of the light in tumultuous masses. It seemed sailing weather to eye and ear; but down between the banks, the wind reached us only in faint and desultory puffs. There was hardly enough to steer by. Progress was intermittent and unsatisfactory. A jocular person, of marine antecedents, hailed us from the tow-path with a ‘C’est vite, mais c’est long.’ </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >运河上熙熙攘攘，一片繁忙景象。我们不时遇上连在一长串一起的驳船，或从它们旁边超过。这些船的船尾很高，舵柄很大，呈绿色。在方向舵的两端各有一扇窗户，其中一扇窗户上似乎还放着一个水壶或是一个花盆。后面跟着一条救生艇。一名妇女忙着做饭，还要照顾几个小孩。这些驳船用纤绳首尾相连，有二十五至三十艘的样子。一艘构造奇特的汽船在前面领航，带动后面的驳船行进。这艘汽船既无明轮，也无螺旋桨；它有某种传动装置，将河底一根明亮的细链条拉出穿过船首，再从船尾松出链条，环环相扣，拖着后面满载货物的驳船前进——不懂机械的人不易理解这种装置。解开疑问前，驳船的前进让人感到有些严肃和不安，因为它在水中缓慢前进，除了两边并排的漩涡渐渐汇入尾流，没有其他迹象表明它在行进。</td>
		<td class="en">The canal was busy enough. Every now and then we met or overtook a long string of boats, with great green tillers; high sterns with a window on either side of the rudder, and perhaps a jug or a flower-pot in one of the windows; a dinghy following behind; a woman busied about the day’s dinner, and a handful of children. These barges were all tied one behind the other with tow ropes, to the number of twenty-five or thirty; and the line was headed and kept in motion by a steamer of strange construction. It had neither paddle-wheel nor screw; but by some gear not rightly comprehensible to the unmechanical mind, it fetched up over its bow a small bright chain which lay along the bottom of the canal, and paying it out again over the stern, dragged itself forward, link by link, with its whole retinue of loaded skows. Until one had found out the key to the enigma, there was something solemn and uncomfortable in the progress of one of these trains, as it moved gently along the water with nothing to mark its advance but an eddy alongside dying away into the wake. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >迄今为止在商业经营的所有产物当中，运河驳船是最令人愉悦的。它扬帆启航，你会感到它是在树梢和风车之上的高处航行，它驶上高架渠，驶过绿油油的麦田：构成最美的水陆风景画。或是让马拉着纤绳以步行速度沉重缓慢地移动，似乎世上压根儿没有商业这回事儿；船员靠在舵柄上做梦，整天都看到地平线上同一个尖顶。照这样的速度，货物究竟如何能到目的地，真是令人百思不得其解；看到驳船在船闸处排队等待通行，则给我们好好上了一课—告诉我们如何简单地看待世界。驳船的甲板上应该有很多心满意足的人，因为这样的生活既是旅行，也是在家休息。</td>
		<td class="en">Of all the creatures of commercial enterprise, a canal barge is by far the most delightful to consider. It may spread its sails, and then you see it sailing high above the tree-tops and the windmill, sailing on the aqueduct, sailing through the green cornlands: the most picturesque of things amphibious. Or the horse plods along at a foot-pace as if there were no such thing as business in the world; and the man dreaming at the tiller sees the same spire on the horizon all day long. It is a mystery how things ever get to their destination at this rate; and to see the barges waiting their turn at a lock, affords a fine lesson of how easily the world may be taken. There should be many contented spirits on board, for such a life is both to travel and to stay at home. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随船向前，烟囱里冒出了炊烟；运河两岸的景色向沉思者慢慢展现开来；驳船漂过一片片茂密的树林，穿过一座座大城市，饱览城里的公共建筑和灯火阑珊。对船夫而言，在他的水上之家，他“躺在床上旅行”，就像在听别人的故事，或是翻看与自己无关的画册。下午时分，他兴许会漫步于运河两岸陌生的乡村，然后回到家，坐在炉边吃晚餐。</td>
		<td class="en">The chimney smokes for dinner as you go along; the banks of the canal slowly unroll their scenery to contemplative eyes; the barge floats by great forests and through great cities with their public buildings and their lamps at night; and for the bargee, in his floating home, “travelling abed,” it is merely as if he were listening to another man’s story or turning the leaves of a picture-book in which he had no concern. He may take his afternoon walk in some foreign country on the banks of the canal, and then come home to dinner at his own fireside. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以高标准的健康要求来衡量，这样的生活缺乏足够的锻炼，但只有不健康的人才需要高标准的健康要求。懒汉从不生病，当然也不健壮，生活过得波澜不惊，死的时候倒更轻松。</td>

		<td class="en">I am sure I would rather be a bargee than occupy any position under heaven that required attendance at an office. There are few callings, I should say, where a man gives up less of his liberty in return for regular meals. The bargee is on shipboard—he is master in his own ship—he can land whenever he will—he can never be kept beating off a lee-shore a whole frosty night when the sheets are as hard as iron; and so far as I can make out, time stands as nearly still with him as is compatible with the return of bed-time or the dinner-hour. It is not easy to see why a bargee should ever die. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从维勒布鲁克到维勒沃德的中途，有一处河段风光旖旎，犹如地主人家的林荫道，我们在这里上岸吃午饭。“阿瑞托莎”号带了两个鸡蛋、一大块面包和一瓶葡萄酒；“西格雷特”号也带了两个鸡蛋，还有一套小酒精炉炊具。“西格雷特”号的主人在上岸时打碎了一个蛋，他并不沮丧，想着兴许还能裹在纸里煮，便把碎了的蛋用佛兰芒语报纸裹着扔进小酒精炉里煮。我们上岸的那一刻还风和日丽，可在岸上没呆两分钟就狂风大作起来，雨点啪哒啪哒打在肩头。我们尽量紧挨着酒精炉坐；酒精猛烈地燃烧着，每隔一两分钟地上的草就会着火，我们不得不把它踩熄；没过多久，我们的几根手指也烧伤了。但与如此的洋相相比，我们完成的烹饪量并不相称。烧了两次火我们才作罢，那个完好的蛋稍显温热；而裹在纸里的那个蛋，变成了又冷又脏、混着印刷油墨和碎蛋壳的烩蛋块。我们继而烘烤另外两个蛋，把它们凑近燃烧的酒精，这样效果好一些。接着，我们拔去酒瓶的木塞，坐在一条沟渠里，将小艇的挡板架在膝盖上方。瓢泼大雨倾泻下来。如果是真正觉得难受，而不是令人恶心地假装舒服的话，不舒服就成了件非常有趣的事了；人们在户外淋成落汤鸡、一筹莫展的样子，确实令人发笑。这样看来，甚至吃裹在报纸里煮的鸡蛋也无伤大雅，尽可把它当成这件趣事的笑料了。但是这种笑话，尽管能让人一笑了之，却不愿再来一次。打那以后，酒精炉就呆在“西格雷特”号的储物箱里，像绅士一样航行了。</td>
		<td class="en">Half-way between Willebroek and Villevorde, in a beautiful reach of canal like a squire’s avenue, we went ashore to lunch. There were two eggs, a junk of bread, and a bottle of wine on board the Arethusa; and two eggs and an Etna cooking apparatus on board the Cigarette. The master of the latter boat smashed one of the eggs in the course of disembarkation; but observing pleasantly that it might still be cooked à la papier, he dropped it into the Etna, in its covering of Flemish newspaper. We landed in a blink of fine weather; but we had not been two minutes ashore before the wind freshened into half a gale, and the rain began to patter on our shoulders. We sat as close about the Etna as we could. The spirits burned with great ostentation; the grass caught flame every minute or two, and had to be trodden out; and before long, there were several burnt fingers of the party. But the solid quantity of cookery accomplished was out of proportion with so much display; and when we desisted, after two applications of the fire, the sound egg was little more than loo-warm; and as for à la papier, it was a cold and sordid fricassée of printer’s ink and broken egg-shell. We made shift to roast the other two, by putting them close to the burning spirits; and that with better success. And then we uncorked the bottle of wine, and sat down in a ditch with our canoe aprons over our knees. It rained smartly. Discomfort, when it is honestly uncomfortable and makes no nauseous pretensions to the contrary, is a vastly humorous business; and people well steeped and stupefied in the open air are in a good vein for laughter. From this point of view, even egg à la papier offered by way of food may pass muster as a sort of accessory to the fun. But this manner of jest, although it may be taken in good part, does not invite repetition; and from that time forward, the Etna voyaged like a gentleman in the locker of the Cigarette. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >自不必说，当我们吃完午饭、回到船上，扬帆准备继续航行时，风又忽然减弱了。我们继续朝维勒沃德航行，虽然风力太小，我们仍旧挂着船帆；时而借一阵风，时而划一阵桨，我们穿行于两岸整齐的树木中，驶过了一个个船闸。</td>
		<td class="en">It is almost unnecessary to mention that when lunch was over and we got aboard again and made sail, the wind promptly died away. The rest of the journey to Villevorde, we still spread our canvas to the unfavouring air; and with now and then a puff, and now and then a spell of paddling, drifted along from lock to lock, between the orderly trees. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是一幅青翠、富饶的美景；或者更准确地说，仅是一条绿色水路，沿岸是一座连一座的村庄。事物都有了固定的模样，正如长期住人的房子一样。我们从桥下经过时，留着平头的小孩儿，站在桥上朝我们吐唾沫，一副小心谨慎的样子。殊不知更谨慎的是那些钓鱼的人，他们专注于浮标，任我们从旁经过，看都不看一眼。他们沿堤岸的斜坡排开，坐在分水桩和扶墙上，悠然自得。他们漠然冷淡，像一块块毫无生气的木头；他们纹丝不动，像古老的荷兰拓印画里的垂钓者。树叶抖动，河水拍岸，而他们却始终保持一个姿势，如同许多法定修建的教堂。即便在他们单纯的脑袋上打个眼儿，你会发现其中除了盘成一团的鱼线，就没有别的东西了。我并不喜欢那些脚穿橡胶长靴、手拿鲑鱼钓竿、挺胸面对山间急流的壮汉；但我倒真喜欢上眼前这些人，他们静坐在安宁平静、人迹稀少的水边，即使很长时间都毫无成效，却仍乐此不疲。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a fine, green, fat landscape; or rather a mere green water-lane, going on from village to village. Things had a settled look, as in places long lived in. Crop-headed children spat upon us from the bridges as we went below, with a true conservative feeling. But even more conservative were the fishermen, intent upon their floats, who let us go by without one glance. They perched upon sterlings and buttresses and along the slope of the embankment, gently occupied. They were indifferent, like pieces of dead nature. They did not move any more than if they had been fishing in an old Dutch print. The leaves fluttered, the water lapped, but they continued in one stay like so many churches established by law.

Nay, now we found ourselves near the end of the Allée Verte, and on the very threshold of Brussels, we were confronted by a serious difficulty. The shores were closely lined by canal boats waiting their turn at the lock. Nowhere was there any convenient landing-place; nowhere so much as a stable-yard to leave the canoes in for the night. We scrambled ashore and entered an estaminet where some sorry fellows were drinking with the landlord. The landlord was pretty round with us; he knew of no coach-house or stableyard, nothing of the sort; and seeing we had come with no mind to drink, he did not conceal his impatience to be rid of us. One of the sorry fellows came to the rescue.

They were all employed over the frivolous mercantile concerns of Belgium during the day; but in the evening they found some hours for the serious concerns of life. I may have a wrong idea of wisdom, but I think that was a very wise remark. People connected with literature and philosophy are busy all their days in getting rid of secondhand notions and false standards. It is their profession, in the sweat of their brows, by dogged thinking, to recover their old fresh view of life, and distinguish what they really and originally like, from what they have only learned to tolerate perforce. And these Royal Nautical Sportsmen had the distinction still quite legible in their hearts. They had still those clean perceptions of what is nice and nasty, what is interesting and what is dull, which envious old gentlemen refer to as illusions. The nightmare illusion of middle age, the bear’s hug of custom gradually squeezing the life out of a man’s soul, had not yet begun for these happy-starred young Belgians. They still knew that the interest they took in their business was a trifling affair compared to their spontaneous, long-suffering affection for nautical sports. To know what you prefer, instead of humbly saying Amen to what the world tells you you ought to prefer, is to have kept your soul alive. Such a man may be generous; he may be honest in something more than the commercial sense; he may love his friends with an elective, personal sympathy, and not accept them as an adjunct of the station to which he has been called. He may be a man, in short, acting on his own instincts, keeping in his own shape that God made him in; and not a mere crank in the social engine-house, welded on principles that he does not understand, and for purposes that he does not care for. </td></tr>

He durst not own his ignorance for the honour of Old England, and spoke away about English clubs and English oarsmen whose fame had never before come to his ears. Several times, and, once above all, on the question of sliding-seats, he was within an ace of exposure. As for the Cigarette, who has rowed races in the heat of his blood, but now disowns these slips of his wanton youth, his case was still more desperate; for the Royal Nautical proposed that he should take an oar in one of their eights on the morrow, to compare the English with the Belgian stroke. I could see my friend perspiring in his chair whenever that particular topic came up. And there was yet another proposal which had the same effect on both of us. It appeared that the champion canoeist of Europe (as well as most other champions) was a Royal Nautical Sportsman.

Perhaps, in a very short time, you would be one no longer. Gymnosophists go into a wood, with all nature seething around them, with romance on every side; it would be much more to the purpose if they took up their abode in a dull country town, where they should see just so much of humanity as to keep them from desiring more, and only the stale externals of man’s life.

How he longed to be somewhere else, and see the round world before he went into the grave! ‘Here I am,’ said he. ‘I drive to the station. Well. And then I drive back again to the hotel. And so on every day and all the week round. My God, is that life?’ I could not say I thought it was—for him. He pressed me to tell him where I had been, and where I hoped to go; and as he listened, I declare the fellow sighed.

I believe it is the longest village in the world; but I dare say in our predicament every pace counted three times over. We were much cast down when we came to the last auberge; and looking in at the dark door, asked timidly if we could sleep there for the night. A female voice assented in no very friendly tones. We clapped the bags down and found our way to chairs.</td></tr>

We were in a large bare apartment, adorned with two allegorical prints of Music and Painting, and a copy of the law against public drunkenness. On one side, there was a bit of a bar, with some half-a-dozen bottles. Two labourers sat waiting supper, in attitudes of extreme weariness; a plain-looking lass bustled about with a sleepy child of two; and the landlady began to derange the pots upon the stove, and set some beefsteak to grill.</td></tr>

You have only to get far enough out of your beat, and all your accomplished airs will go for nothing. These Hainaulters could see no difference between us and the average pedlar. Indeed we had some grounds for reflection while the steak was getting ready, to see how perfectly they accepted us at their own valuation, and how our best politeness and best efforts at entertainment seemed to fit quite suitably with the character of packmen. At least it seemed a good account of the profession in France, that even before such judges we could not beat them at our own weapons. </td></tr>

The landlady, her son, and the lass aforesaid, took the same. Our meal was quite a banquet by comparison.

It had not before occurred to me that a pedlar was a great man in a labourer’s ale-house; but now that I had to enact the part for an evening, I found that so it was. He has in his hedge quarters somewhat the same pre-eminency as the man who takes a private parlour in an hotel.

He had evidently prospered without any of the favours of education; for he adhered with stern simplicity to the masculine gender, and in the course of the evening passed off some fancy futures in a very florid style of architecture. With him came his wife, a comely young woman with her hair tied in a yellow kerchief, and their son, a little fellow of four, in a blouse and military kèpi. It was notable that the child was many degrees better dressed than either of the parents. We were informed he was already at a boarding-school; but the holidays having just commenced, he was off to spend them with his parents on a cruise. An enchanting holiday occupation, was it not? to travel all day with father and mother in the tilt cart full of countless treasures; the green country rattling by on either side, and the children in all the villages contemplating him with envy and wonder? It is better fun, during the holidays, to be the son of a travelling merchant, than son and heir to the greatest cotton-spinner in creation.

Monsieur kept insisting on his sagacity: how he knew all the children at school by name; and when this utterly failed on trial, how he was cautious and exact to a strange degree, and if asked anything, he would sit and think—and think, and if he did not know it, ‘my faith, he wouldn’t tell you at all—foi, il ne vous le dira pas’: which is certainly a very high degree of caution. At intervals, M. Hector would appeal to his wife, with his mouth full of beefsteak, as to the little fellow’s age at such or such a time when he had said or done something memorable; and I noticed that Madame usually pooh-poohed these inquiries. She herself was not boastful in her vein; but she never had her fill of caressing the child; and she seemed to take a gentle pleasure in recalling all that was fortunate in his little existence. No schoolboy could have talked more of the holidays which were just beginning and less of the black school-time which must inevitably follow after. She showed, with a pride perhaps partly mercantile in origin, his pockets preposterously swollen with tops and whistles and string. When she called at a house in the way of business, it appeared he kept her company; and whenever a sale was made, received a sou out of the profit. Indeed they spoiled him vastly, these two good people. But they had an eye to his manners for all that, and reproved him for some little faults in breeding, which occurred from time to time during supper. </td></tr>

Hector was more at home, indeed, and took a higher tone with the world; but that was explicable on the ground of his driving a donkey-cart, while we poor bodies tramped afoot.

But there were some calm intervals, and one notably, when we were skirting the forest of Mormal, a sinister name to the ear, but a place most gratifying to sight and smell. It looked solemn along the river-side, drooping its boughs into the water, and piling them up aloft into a wall of leaves. What is a forest but a city of nature’s own, full of hardy and innocuous living things, where there is nothing dead and nothing made with the hands, but the citizens themselves are the houses and public monuments? There is nothing so much alive, and yet so quiet, as a woodland; and a pair of people, swinging past in canoes, feel very small and bustling by comparison. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">And surely of all smells in the world, the smell of many trees is the sweetest and most fortifying. The sea has a rude, pistolling sort of odour, that takes you in the nostrils like snuff, and carries with it a fine sentiment of open water and tall ships; but the smell of a forest, which comes nearest to this in tonic quality, surpasses it by many degrees in the quality of softness. Again, the smell of the sea has little variety, but the smell of a forest is infinitely changeful; it varies with the hour of the day, not in strength merely, but in character; and the different sorts of trees, as you go from one zone of the wood to another, seem to live among different kinds of atmosphere. Usually the resin of the fir predominates. But some woods are more coquettish in their habits; and the breath of the forest of Mormal, as it came aboard upon us that showery afternoon, was perfumed with nothing less delicate than sweetbrier. </td></tr>

Heine3 wished to lie like Merlin4 under the oaks of Broceliande. I should not be satisfied with one tree; but if the wood grew together like a banyan grove, I would be buried under the tap-root of the whole; my parts should circulate from oak to oak; and my consciousness should be diffused abroad in all the forest, and give a common heart to that assembly of green spires, so that it also might rejoice in its own loveliness and dignity.

It was odd how the showers began when we had to carry the boats over a lock, and must expose our legs. They always did. This is a sort of thing that readily begets a personal feeling against nature. There seems no reason why the shower should not come five minutes before or five minutes after, unless you suppose an intention to affront you. The Cigarette had a mackintosh which put him more or less above these contrarieties. But I had to bear the brunt uncovered. I began to remember that nature was a woman. My companion, in a rosier temper, listened with great satisfaction to my Jeremiads, and ironically concurred.

He said it was the silliest enterprise that ever he heard of. Why, did I not know, he asked me, that it was nothing but locks, locks, locks, the whole way? not to mention that, at this season of the year, we should find the Oise quite dry? ‘Get into a train, my little young man,’ said he, ‘and go you away home to your parents.’ I was so astounded at the man’s malice, that I could only stare at him in silence. A tree would never have spoken to me like this. At last I got out with some words. We had come from Antwerp already, I told him, which was a good long way; and we should do the rest in spite of him.

We should be seen pottering on deck in all the dignity of years, our white beards falling into our laps.

There should be books in the cabin, and tobacco-jars, and some old Burgundy as red as a November sunset and as odorous as a violet in April. There should be a flageolet, whence the Cigarette, with cunning touch, should draw melting music under the stars; or perhaps, laying that aside, upraise his voice—somewhat thinner than of yore, and with here and there a quaver, or call it a natural grace-note—in rich and solemn psalmody. </td></tr>

It must have been to some such measure that the spinners and the young maids sang, ‘Come away, Death,’ in the Shakespearian Illyria4. There is so often a threatening note, something blatant and metallic, in the voice of bells, that I believe we have fully more pain than pleasure from hearing them; but these, as they sounded abroad, now high, now low, now with a plaintive cadence that caught the ear like the burthen of a popular song, were always moderate and tunable, and seemed to fall in with the spirit of still, rustic places, like the noise of a waterfall or the babble of a rookery in spring. I could have asked the bell-ringer for his blessing, good, sedate old man, who swung the rope so gently to the time of his meditations. I could have blessed the priest or the heritors, or whoever may be concerned with such affairs in France, who had left these sweet old bells to gladden the afternoon, and not held meetings, and made collections, and had their names repeatedly printed in the local paper, to rig up a peal of brand-new, brazen, Birmingham5-hearted substitutes, who should bombard their sides to the provocation of a brand-new bell-ringer, and fill the echoes of the valley with terror and riot. </td></tr>

I had my backboard down in a trice, and aimed for a place where the trunk seemed high enough above the water, and the branches not too thick to let me slip below. When a man has just vowed eternal brotherhood with the universe, he is not in a temper to take great determinations coolly, and this, which might have been a very important determination for me, had not been taken under a happy star. The tree caught me about the chest, and while I was yet struggling to make less of myself and get through, the river took the matter out of my hands, and bereaved me of my boat. The Arethusa swung round broadside on, leaned over, ejected so much of me as still remained on board, and thus disencumbered, whipped under the tree, righted, and went merrily away down stream. </td></tr>

He had offered his services to haul me out, but as I was then already on my elbows, I had declined, and sent him down stream after the truant Arethusa. The stream was too rapid for a man to mount with one canoe, let alone two, upon his hands. So I crawled along the trunk to shore, and proceeded down the meadows by the river-side. I was so cold that my heart was sore. I had now an idea of my own why the reeds so bitterly shivered. I could have given any of them a lesson. The Cigarette remarked facetiously that he thought I was ‘taking exercise’ as I drew near, until he made out for certain that I was only twittering with cold. I had a rub down with a towel, and donned a dry suit from the india-rubber bag. But I was not my own man again for the rest of the voyage. I had a queasy sense that I wore my last dry clothes upon my body. The struggle had tired me; and perhaps, whether I knew it or not, I was a little dashed in spirit. The devouring element in the universe had leaped out against me, in this green valley quickened by a running stream. The bells were all very pretty in their way, but I had heard some of the hollow notes of Pan’s music. Would the wicked river drag me down by the heels, indeed? and look so beautiful all the time?

Side by side with the flippant, rowdy nonsense of the Paris musichalls, there were many pastoral pieces, not without a touch of poetry, I thought, and instinct with the brave independence of the poorer class in France. There you might read how the wood-cutter gloried in his axe, and the gardener scorned to be ashamed of his spade. It was not very well written, this poetry of labour, but the pluck of the sentiment redeemed what was weak or wordy in the expression. The martial and the patriotic pieces, on the other hand, were tearful, womanish productions one and all. The poet had passed under the Caudine Forks3; he sang for an army visiting the tomb of its old renown, with arms reversed; and sang not of victory, but of death. There was a number in the hawker’s collection called ‘Conscrits Francais,’ which may rank among the most dissuasive war-lyrics on record. It would not be possible to fight at all in such a spirit. The bravest conscript would turn pale if such a ditty were struck up beside him on the morning of battle; and whole regiments would pile their arms to its tune. </td></tr>

There is not much of the trumpet note in them, perhaps, to stir a man’s heart in his bosom; they lack the lyrical elation, and move slowly; but they are written in a grave, honourable, stoical spirit, which should carry soldiers far in a good cause. One feels as if one would like to trust Dérouléde with something. It will be happy if he can so far inoculate his fellow-countrymen that they may be trusted with their own future.

Never again shall his kind smile put peace among all races of artistic men, and make the Englishman at home in France. Never more shall the sheep, who were not more innocent at heart than he, sit all unconsciously for his industrious pencil. He died too early, at the very moment when he was beginning to put forth fresh sprouts, and blossom into something worthy of himself; and yet none who knew him will think he lived in vain. I never knew a man so little, for whom yet I had so much affection; and I find it a good test of others, how much they had learned to understand and value him. His was indeed a good influence in life while he was still among us; he had a fresh laugh, it did you good to see him; and however sad he may have been at heart, he always bore a bold and cheerful countenance, and took fortune’s worst as it were the showers of spring.

On the other hand, it is not at all a strong thing to put one’s reliance upon logic; and our own logic particularly, for it is generally wrong.

There is an upright stock in a man’s own heart, that is trustier than any syllogism; and the eyes, and the sympathies and appetites, know a thing or two that have never yet been stated in controversy. Reasons are as plentiful as blackberries; and, like fisticuffs, they serve impartially with all sides. Doctrines do not stand or fall by their proofs, and are only logical in so far as they are cleverly put. An able controversialist no more than an able general demonstrates the justice of his cause.

It ran so fast and merrily, through all the windings of its channel, that I strained my thumb, fighting with the rapids, and had to paddle all the rest of the way with one hand turned up. Sometimes it had to serve mills; and being still a little river, ran very dry and shallow in the meanwhile. We had to put our legs out of the boat, and shove ourselves off the sand of the bottom with our feet. And still it went on its way singing among the poplars, and making a green valley in the world. After a good woman, and a good book, and tobacco, there is nothing so agreeable on earth as a river. I forgave it its attempt on my life; which was after all one part owing to the unruly winds of heaven that had blown down the tree, one part to my own mismanagement, and only a third part to the river itself, and that not out of malice, but from its great preoccupation over its business of getting to the sea. A difficult business, too; for the détours it had to make are not to be counted. The geographers seem to have given up the attempt; for I found no map represent the infinite contortion of its course. A fact will say more than any of them. After we had been some hours, three if I mistake not, flitting by the trees at this smooth, breakneck gallop, when we came upon a hamlet and asked where we were, we had got no farther than four kilometres (say two miles and a half) from Origny. If it were not for the honour of the thing (in the Scots saying), we might almost as well have been standing still. </td></tr>

At that hour, stockbrokers were shouting in Paris Bourse for two or three per cent.; but we minded them as little as the sliding stream, and sacrificed a hecatomb of minutes to the gods of tobacco and digestion.

The landlady was a stout, plain, short-sighted, motherly body, with something not far short of a genius for cookery. She had a guess of her excellence herself. After every dish was sent in, she would come and look on at the dinner for a while, with puckered, blinking eyes. ‘C’est bon, n’est-ce pas?’ she would say; and when she had received a proper answer, she disappeared into the kitchen. That common French dish, partridge and cabbages, became a new thing in my eyes at the Golden Sheep; and many subsequent dinners have bitterly disappointed me in consequence.

		<td class="en">Noyon stands about a mile from the river, in a little plain surrounded by wooded hills, and entirely covers an eminence with its tile roofs, surmounted by a long, straight-backed cathedral with two stiff towers. As we got into the town, the tile roofs seemed to tumble uphill one upon another, in the oddest disorder; but for all their scrambling, they did not attain above the knees of the cathedral, which stood, upright and solemn, over all. As the streets drew near to this presiding genius, through the market-place under the Hôtel de Ville, they grew emptier and more composed. Blank walls and shuttered windows were turned to the great edifice, and grass grew on the white causeway. ‘Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.’ The Hôtel du Nord, nevertheless, lights its secular tapers within a stone-cast of the church; and we had the superb east-end1 before our eyes all morning from the window of our bedroom. I have seldom looked on the east-end of a church with more complete sympathy. As it flanges out in three wide terraces and settles down broadly on the earth, it looks like the poop of some great old battle-ship. Hollow-backed buttresses carry vases, which figure for the stern lanterns. There is a roll in the ground, and the towers just appear above the pitch of the roof, as though the good ship were bowing lazily over an Atlantic swell. At any moment it might be a hundred feet away from you, climbing the next billow. At any moment a window might open, and some old admiral thrust forth a cocked hat, and proceed to take an observation. The old admirals sail the sea no longer; the old ships of battle are all broken up, and live only in pictures; but this, that was a church before ever they were thought upon, is still a church, and makes as brave an appearance by the Oise. The cathedral and the river are probably the two oldest things for miles around; and certainly they have both a grand old age. </td></tr>

		<td class="en"> I find I never weary of great churches. It is my favourite kind of mountain scenery. Mankind was never so happily inspired as when it made a cathedral: a thing as single and specious as a statue to the first glance, and yet, on examination, as lively and interesting as a forest in detail. The height of spires cannot be taken by trigonometry; they measure absurdly short, but how tall they are to the admiring eye! And where we have so many elegant proportions, growing one out of the other, and all together into one, it seems as if proportion transcended itself, and became something different and more imposing. I could never fathom how a man dares to lift up his voice to preach in a cathedral. What is he to say that will not be an anticlimax? For though I have heard a considerable variety of sermons, I never yet heard one that was so expressive as a cathedral. ,Tis the best preacher itself, and preaches day and night; not only telling you of man’s art and aspirations in the past, but convicting your own soul of ardent sympathies; or rather, like all good preachers, it sets you preaching to yourself;—and every man is his own doctor of divinity in the last resort. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">As I sat outside of the hotel in the course of the afternoon, the sweet groaning thunder of the organ floated out of the church like a summons. I was not averse, liking the theatre so well, to sit out an act or two of the play, but I could never rightly make out the nature of the service I beheld. Four or five priests and as many choristers were singing Miserere before the high altar when I went in. There was no congregation but a few old women on chairs and old men kneeling on the pavement. After a while a long train of young girls, walking two and two, each with a lighted taper in her hand, and all dressed in black with a white veil, came from behind the altar, and began to descend the nave; the four first carrying a Virgin and child upon a table. The priests and choristers arose from their knees and followed after, singing ‘Ave Mary’ as they went. In this order they made the circuit of the cathedral, passing twice before me where I leaned against a pillar. The priest who seemed of most consequence was a strange, down-looking old man. He kept mumbling prayers with his lips; but as he looked upon me darkling, it did not seem as if prayer were uppermost in his heart. Two others, who bore the burthen of the chaunt, were stout, brutal, military-looking men of forty, with bold, over-fed eyes; they sang with some lustiness, and trolled forth ‘Ave Mary’ like a garrison catch. The little girls were timid and grave. As they footed slowly up the aisle, each one took a moment’s glance at the Englishman; and the big nun who played marshal fairly stared him out of countenance. As for the choristers, from first to last they misbehaved as only boys can misbehave; and cruelly marred the performance with their antics.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I understood a great deal of the spirit of what went on. Indeed it would be difficult not to understand the "Miserere", which I take to be the composition of an atheist. If it ever be a good thing to take such despondency to heart, the "Miserere" is the right music, and a cathedral a fit scene. So far I am at one with the Catholics:—an odd name for them, after all? But why, in God’s name, these holiday choristers? why these priests who steal wandering looks about the congregation while they feign to be at prayer? why this fat nun, who rudely arranges her procession and shakes delinquent virgins by the elbow? why this spitting, and snuffing, and forgetting of keys, and the thousand and one little misadventures that disturb a frame of mind laboriously edified with chaunts and organings?

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还有一件事让我很沮丧。我最近进行了大量的户外锻炼，因此我能忍受一次祷告曲；但是我希望老人们去别的地方。对于那些经历过多次灾难的男男女女们来说，《祷告曲》并不是适合的音乐，也不是适合的教义，而且，或许他们对生活中的悲剧的部分有着自己的见解。通常上了年纪的人都能为自己唱祷告曲；尽管我注意到，这样的人通常选择《为天主欢呼》作为日常的赞美诗。总的来说，对于那些老人们来说，最具有宗教意义的活动莫过于是唤起他们自己的回忆，许多已故的朋友、人生好多次的希望的破灭、多少次的失败以及许多欢乐的时光；这一切中当然就包含了生动的说教。</td>
		<td class="en">One other circumstance distressed me. I could bear a "Miserere" myself, having had a good deal of open-air exercise of late; but I wished the old people somewhere else. It was neither the right sort of music nor the right sort of divinity for men and women who have come through most accidents by this time, and probably have an opinion of their own upon the tragic element in life. A person up in years can generally do his own Miserere for himself; although I notice that such an one often prefers Jubilate Deo for his ordinary singing. On the whole, the most religious exercise for the aged is probably to recall their own experience; so many friends dead, so many hopes disappointed, so many slips and stumbles, and withal so many bright days and smiling providences; there is surely the matter of a very eloquent sermon in all this. </td></tr>

In the little pictorial map of our whole Inland Voyage, which my fancy still preserves, and sometimes unrolls for the amusement of odd moments, Noyon cathedral figures on a most preposterous scale, and must be nearly as large as a department. I can still see the faces of the priests as if they were at my elbow, and hear Ave Maria, ora pro nobis, sounding through the church. All Noyon is blotted out for me by these superior memories; and I do not care to say more about the place. It was but a stack of brown roofs at the best, where I believe people live very reputably in a quiet way; but the shadow of the church falls upon it when the sun is low, and the five bells are heard in all quarters, telling that the organ has begun.

There is royal arrogance in every line of him; the stirruped foot projects insolently from the frame; the eye is hard and proud; the very horse seems to be treading with gratification over prostrate serfs, and to have the breath of the trumpet in his nostrils.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我有一种感觉，那就是在我们的旅途中迷雾一直陪伴着我们，而且从那个时候开始，它们就经常出现在我的记事本中。在瓦兹河还是一条乡间小河时，它带着我们来到人家门前，河边的田地里，我们与一直生活在那里的人们相谈甚欢。但是，现在的瓦兹河已经变宽了，沿岸的生活景象从我们身边经过时和我们隔着一段距离。其实，这就像是宽阔的公路与在农舍花园里进进出出的乡间小道之间的差别一样。我们现在住在城里，没有人用各种问题来麻烦我们了。我们进入了文明社会，在这个社会里人们从身边走过却不打招呼。在人烟稀少的地方，我们总是竭尽所能与我们遇到的每一个人多聊一些。但是，当我们身处城市里的时候，我们总是保持沉默，除非踩到别人的脚，不然不会吭声。在这片水域上，我们不再是陌生的鸟儿，人们觉得我们不过是从附近的城镇来的。比如，我记得当我们来到利勒亚当的时候，我们看到许多观光船下午时分出城闲逛。除了我的船帆有点破旧以外，在这里根本看不出真正的航行者与业余爱好者的差别。其中一条船上的人们居然把我认成了他们的邻居。还有比这更令人伤心的事吗？所有的冒险故事都只剩下这句轻描淡写。然而在瓦兹河的上游，通常除了鱼儿没有什么东西在河里游，因此，两个划艇者不可能用邻里间出来观光这么庸俗简单的理由解释过去；我们是陌生而独特的入侵者；一路上，从人们的诧异中产生了一种轻快的、一闪即过的亲密感。世上的事除了针锋相对以外，没有别的什么了，尽管有时很难察觉。因为，这些宿怨甚至比我们都老，而且自出现起就从未得到完满的解决。你给别人带去多少乐趣，便从别人那里得到多少。只要我们被当成奇怪的流浪者，被人盯着看，像江湖郎中或商贩那样被人跟着，我们也总能从他们那里得到不少的乐趣；但是一旦我们成了寻常旅客，所有遇见的人们都一样对我们不感兴趣。在无趣的人眼里世界是无趣的，其中有很多原因，这可以算作一条。</td>
		<td class="en">There is a sense in which those mists never rose from off our journey; and from that time forth they lie very densely in my notebook. As long as the Oise was a small rural river, it took us near by people’s doors, and we could hold a conversation with natives in the riparian fields. But now that it had grown so wide, the life along shore passed us by at a distance. It was the same difference as between a great public highway and a country bypath that wanders in and out of cottage gardens. We now lay in towns, where nobody troubled us with questions; we had floated into civilised life, where people pass without salutation. In sparsely inhabited places, we make all we can of each encounter; but when it comes to a city, we keep to ourselves, and never speak unless we have trodden on a man’s toes. In these waters we were no longer strange birds, and nobody supposed we had travelled farther than from the last town. I remember, when we came into L’Isle Adam, for instance, how we met dozens of pleasure-boats outing it for the afternoon, and there was nothing to distinguish the true voyager from the amateur, except, perhaps, the filthy condition of my sail. The company in one boat actually thought they recognised me for a neighbour. Was there ever anything more wounding? All the romance had come down to that. Now, on the upper Oise, where nothing sailed as a general thing but fish, a pair of canoeists could not be thus vulgarly explained away; we were strange and picturesque intruders; and out of people’s wonder sprang a sort of light and passing intimacy all along our route. There is nothing but tit-for-tat in this world, though sometimes it be a little difficult to trace: for the scores are older than we ourselves, and there has never yet been a settling day since things were. You get entertainment pretty much in proportion as you give. As long as we were a sort of odd wanderers, to be stared at and followed like a quack doctor or a caravan, we had no want of amusement in return; but as soon as we sank into commonplace ourselves, all whom we met were similarly disenchanted. And here is one reason of a dozen, why the world is dull to dull persons. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">We ceased reading entirely. Sometimes when I found a newspaper, I took a particular pleasure in reading a single number of the current novel; but I never could bear more than three installments; and even the second was a disappointment. As soon as the tale became in any way perspicuous, it lost all merit in my eyes; only a single scene, or, as is the way with these Feuilletons, half a scene, without antecedent or consequence, like a piece of a dream, had the knack of fixing my interest. The less I saw of the novel, the better I liked it: a pregnant ref lection. But for the most part, as I said, we neither of us read anything in the world, and employed the very little while we were awake between bed and dinner in poring upon maps. I have always been fond of maps, and can voyage in an atlas with the greatest enjoyment. The names of places are singularly inviting; the contour of coasts and rivers is enthralling to the eye; and to hit, in a map, upon some place you have heard of before, makes history a new possession. But we thumbed our charts, on these evenings, with the blankest unconcern. We cared not a fraction for this place or that. We stared at the sheet as children listen to their rattle; and read the names of towns or villages to forget them again at once. We had no romance in the matter; there was nobody so fancy-free. If you had taken the maps away while we were studying them most intently, it is a fair bet whether we might not have continued to study the table with the same delight. </td></tr>

But there is a romance about the matter after all. Probably the table has more devotees than love; and I am sure that food is much more generally entertaining than scenery. Do you give in, as Walt Whitman1 would say, that you are any the less immortal for that? The true materialism is to be ashamed of what we are.

To dip the paddle at the proper inclination, now right, now left; to keep the head down stream; to empty the little pool that gathered in the lap of the apron; to screw up the eyes against the glittering sparkles of sun upon the water; or now and again to pass below the whistling tow-rope of the Deo Gratias of Conde, or the Four Sons of Aymon—there was not much art in that; certain silly muscles managed it between sleep and waking; and meanwhile the brain had a whole holiday, and went to sleep. We took in, at a glance, the larger features of the scene; and beheld, with half an eye, bloused fishers and dabbling washerwomen on the bank. Now and again we might be half-wakened by some church spire, by a leaping fish, or by a trail of river grass that clung about the paddle and had to be plucked off and thrown away. But these luminous intervals were only partially luminous. A little more of us was called into action, but never the whole. The central bureau of nerves, what in some moods we call Ourselves, enjoyed its holiday without disturbance, like a Government Office. The great wheels of intelligence turned idly in the head, like fly-wheels, grinding no grist. I have gone on for half an hour at a time, counting my strokes and forgetting the hundreds. I flatter myself the beasts that perish could not underbid that, as a low form of consciousness. And what a pleasure it was! What a hearty, tolerant temper did it bring about!

What philosophers call me and not-me, ego and non ego, preoccupied me whether I would or no. There was less me and more notme than I was accustomed to expect. I looked on upon somebody else, who managed the paddling; I was aware of somebody else’s feet against the stretcher; my own body seemed to have no more intimate relation to me than the canoe, or the river, or the river banks. Nor this alone: something inside my mind, a part of my brain, a province of my proper being, had thrown off allegiance and set up for itself, or perhaps for the somebody else who did the paddling. I had dwindled into quite a little thing in a corner of myself. I was isolated in my own skull. Thoughts presented themselves unbidden; they were not my thoughts, they were plainly some one else’s; and I considered them like a part of the landscape. I take it, in short, that I was about as near Nirvana as would be convenient in practical life; and if this be so, I make the Buddhists my sincere compliments; 'tis an agreeable state, not very consistent with mental brilliancy, not exactly profitable in a money point of view, but very calm, golden, and incurious, and one that sets a man superior to alarms. It may be best figured by supposing yourself to get dead drunk, and yet keep sober to enjoy it.

		<td class="en">We made our first stage below Compiègne to Pont Sainte Maxence. I was abroad a little after six the next morning. The air was biting, and smelt of frost. In an open place a score of women wrangled together over the day’s market; and the noise of their negotiation sounded thin and querulous like that of sparrows on a winter’s morning. The rare passengers blew into their hands, and shuffled in their wooden shoes to set the blood agog. The streets were full of icy shadow, although the chimneys were smoking overhead in golden sunshine. If you wake early enough at this season of the year, you may get up in December to break your fast in June.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我去了教堂；教堂总是有东西可看，不管是活生生的礼拜者还是死亡者的坟墓。在那里，你会发现极端的真诚和最空洞的虚伪。即使那里没有古老的历史，那也肯定会有一些当前的闲谈。教堂里不像外边那么冷，但是看起来似乎比外边还冷。教堂里的白色中殿看起来简直就是北极；华丽的祭坛则像是大陆，在这孤寂的地方和寒冷的空气中比平时看起来更荒凉。两个牧师坐在高坛上读书，等待着忏悔者。中殿的稍远处，一位年迈的妇人正在虔诚地祈祷。当健康的年轻人在呵手拍胸取暖的时候，她却还能拨弄念珠，真是一个奇迹。尽管这点让我不安，但使我更加沮丧的是她那些举动的性质。她从一个椅子走到另一个椅子，从一个祭坛走到另一个祭坛，围绕教堂一周。在每个神龛前边她都拨动相同数目的念珠，以同样长的时间祷告。如同一个谨慎而又对商业前景有些悲观的资本家一样，她想要把她的祈求分置多处，以求在天国里得到各种各样的安全保证。她不会冒险忽略任何一个代主教。所有的圣人和天使都会以为自己是她为了不受最后的审判而选择的护卫者。她的这种行为在我看来只是一种由于不自觉的怀疑而做出的无知、明显的欺骗。</td>
		<td class="en">I found my way to the church; for there is always something to see about a church, whether living worshippers or dead men’s tombs; you find there the deadliest earnest, and the hollowest deceit; and even where it is not a piece of history, it will be certain to leak out some contemporary gossip. It was scarcely so cold in the church as it was without, but it looked colder. The white nave was positively arctic to the eye; and the tawdriness of a continental altar looked more forlorn than usual in the solitude and the bleak air. Two priests sat in the chancel, reading and waiting penitents; and out in the nave, one very old woman was engaged in her devotions. It was a wonder how she was able to pass her beads when healthy young people were breathing in their palms and slapping their chest; but though this concerned me, I was yet more dispirited by the nature of her exercises. She went from chair to chair, from altar to altar, circumnavigating the church. To each shrine she dedicated an equal number of beads and an equal length of time. Like a prudent capitalist with a somewhat cynical view of the commercial prospect, she desired to place her supplications in a great variety of heavenly securities. She would risk nothing on the credit of any single intercessor. Out of the whole company of saints and angels, not one but was to suppose himself her champion elect against the Great Assize! I could only think of it as a dull, transparent jugglery, based upon unconscious unbelief. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是我见过的最没有生气的老妇人；只是把骨头和皮奇异地放在了一起。她用质询的目光与我对视，那双眼睛里没有一点神色。是否把她称为盲人，这就取决于你对“看见”的定义了。或许，她曾懂得什么叫爱：也许她有过孩子，喂养他们并给他们起过亲昵的名字。但是现在这一切都过去了，那些经历没让她更快乐，也没使她更睿智。她每天早上所能做的就是来到这里，走进冰冷的教堂，骗取天国里的一席之地。我哽咽了一下，匆匆逃到大街去呼吸一下清晨凛冽的空气。清晨？夜晚来临以前她对这个词多么厌倦啊！如果她没休息，那她又会怎么样？幸运的是我们中的大部分人都不用在七十岁时被带到法庭上公开受审为自己的这一生脱罪；幸运的是这么多人在风华正茂时遭遇迎头一击，然后去往他处，独自为其愚蠢受惩罚。要不然，在生病的孩子和不满的老人之间，我们会对生活失去信念。</td>
		<td class="en">She was as dead an old woman as ever I saw; no more than bone and parchment, curiously put together. Her eyes, with which she interrogated mine, were vacant of sense. It depends on what you call seeing, whether you might not call her blind. Perhaps she had known love: perhaps borne children, suckled them and given them pet names. But now that was all gone by, and had left her neither happier nor wiser; and the best she could do with her mornings was to come up here into the cold church and juggle for a slice of heaven. It was not without a gulp that I escaped into the streets and the keen morning air. Morning? why, how tired of it she would be before night! and if she did not sleep, how then? It is fortunate that not many of us are brought up publicly to justify our lives at the bar of threescore years and ten; fortunate that such a number are knocked opportunely on the head in what they call the flower of their years, and go away to suffer for their follies in private somewhere else. Otherwise, between sick children and discontented old folk, we might be put out of all conceit of life. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们在库瑞尔停下来吃午饭，并且把船停放在另一个水上洗衣房旁。时值正午，那里挤满了洗衣妇，她们双手冻的通红，大声地说着话。这些女人以及她们放肆的玩笑几乎是我对这个地方的所有记忆。如果你很想知道的话，我就查查我的历史书，告诉你一两个日期，因为日期在英国的战争史上占有重要地位。但是我更想提一下一所女子寄宿学校，它使我们感兴趣，因为它是一所女子寄宿学校，还因为我们设想自己真的会对它感兴趣。至少——在那里的花园里有女孩子；而在这里的河上有我们；当我们经过的时候，不止一个人向我们挥起手帕。我的内心久久不能平静，如果我们在槌球聚会上已经认识，我和这些女孩们可能早就已经厌倦和鄙视对方了！然而这是我喜爱的一种方式：向我今后可能永远都不会再见的人送去一个飞吻或挥一挥手帕，拿机遇打赌，敲上一个钉子把幻想挂起来。它提醒旅行的人自己并非在任何地方都是一名过客，在实际生活的道路上旅行不过是一段午休。</td>
		<td class="en">At Creil, where we stopped to lunch, we left the canoes in another floating lavatory, which, as it was high noon, was packed with washerwomen, red-handed and loud-voiced; and they and their broad jokes are about all I remember of the place. I could look up my history-books, if you were very anxious, and tell you a date or two; for it figured rather largely in the English wars. But I prefer to mention a girls’ boarding-school, which had an interest for us because it was a girls’ boarding-school, and because we imagined we had rather an interest for it. At least—there were the girls about the garden; and here were we on the river; and there was more than one handkerchief waved as we went by. It caused quite a stir in my heart; and yet how we should have wearied and despised each other, these girls and I, if we had been introduced at a croquet-party! But this is a fashion I love: to kiss the hand or wave a handkerchief to people I shall never see again, to play with possibility, and knock in a peg for fancy to hang upon. It gives the traveller a jog, reminds him that he is not a traveller everywhere, and that his journey is no more than a siesta by the way on the real march of life. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从里面看，库瑞尔的教堂是一个难以名状的地方，耀眼的阳光透过窗户洒进来，还装饰着“苦难历程”圆形浮雕。但是有一样古怪的东西，它带有还愿物的色彩，我非常喜欢：一艘平底船仿真模型从穹顶悬挂下来，上边写着一句祈福的话，意为愿上帝引导库瑞尔的“圣尼古拉斯号”到达安全的港湾。模型制作精良，肯定会使水边的男孩子们大为欢喜。但让我发笑的是设想航程危险的严肃感。你可以悬挂一艘海船模型，并且欢迎：一艘船，它即将环游世界，即将走过赤道或经过两极，将经历种种需要祈祷以求平安度过的危险。但是库瑞尔的“圣尼古拉斯”号，在十几年间被拉车的马匹拖着，行驶于长满水草的运河，白杨树在头顶沙沙作响，船长边吹口哨边掌着舵；它所有的使命都会在草木葱翠的内陆完成，所有的航行都不会离开乡村钟楼的视野范围；怎么，你大概在想是不是有些事可以在没有造物主干涉的情况下完成，这个便是如此！但是可能船长是一个幽默的人，或者可能是一个先知，通过这个荒谬可笑的象征物提醒着人们生活的严肃性。</td>
		<td class="en">The church at Creil was a nondescript place in the inside, splashed with gaudy lights from the windows, and picked out with medallions of the Dolorous Way. But there was one oddity, in the way of an ex voto, which pleased me hugely: a faithful model of a canal boat, swung from the vault, with a written aspiration that God should conduct the Saint Nicolas of Creil to a good haven. The thing was neatly executed, and would have made the delight of a party of boys on the waterside. But what tickled me was the gravity of the peril to be conjured. You might hang up the model of a sea-going ship, and welcome: one that is to plough a furrow round the world, and visit the tropic or the frosty poles, runs dangers that are well worth a candle and a mass. But the Saint Nicolas of Creil, which was to be tugged for some ten years by patient draught-horses, in a weedy canal, with the poplars chattering overhead, and the skipper whistling at the tiller; which was to do all its errands in green inland places, and never get out of sight of a village belfry in all its cruising; why, you would have thought if anything could be done without the intervention of Providence, it would be that! But perhaps the skipper was a humorist: or perhaps a prophet, reminding people of the seriousness of life by this preposterous token. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在库瑞尔，就像在努瓦永一样，圣约瑟似乎在守时这方面受到人们的喜爱。日期和时间都可以详细说明；当祈愿被准时实现时，感恩的人们一定会在还愿匾上写明日期和时间。只要是与时间相关的，圣约瑟就是最好的调解人。看到他在法国如此受欢迎，我感到很高兴，因为这位善良的人在我们国家的宗教里只扮演一个很小的角色。然而，我禁不住害怕，这位圣人如此严格地执行时间会被认为应该感激还愿匾。</td>
		<td class="en">At Creil, as at Noyon, Saint Joseph1 seemed a favourite saint on the score of punctuality. Day and hour can be specified; and grateful people do not fail to specify them on a votive tablet, when prayers have been punctually and neatly answered. Whenever time is a consideration, Saint Joseph is the proper intermediary. I took a sort of pleasure in observing the vogue he had in France, for the good man plays a very small part in my religion at home. Yet I could not help fearing that, where the Saint is so much commanded for exactitude, he will be expected to be very grateful for his tablet. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对我们新教徒来说这是挺愚蠢的；而且不管怎么说都没什么重大意义。对于恩赐的感激，人们是聪明地说出来还是尽心地做出来都是次要的，只要他们心存感激就行。真正的无知是一个人不知道他受到了恩赐而想象是凭自己得到的。毕竟自以为是的人是最可笑的空谈家！赐予混沌一线光明和用一盒专利火柴来点燃大都市里会客厅的煤气灯，有着明显的不同。做我们想做的事，我们手中总是有东西可以利用的，哪怕只是我们的手指头。</td>
		<td class="en">This is foolishness to us Protestants; and not of great importance anyway. Whether people’s gratitude for the good gifts that come to them be wisely conceived or dutifully expressed, is a secondary matter, after all, so long as they feel gratitude. The true ignorance is when a man does not know that he has received a good gift, or begins to imagine that he has got it for himself. The self-made man is the funniest windbag after all! There is a marked difference between decreeing light in chaos, and lighting the gas in a metropolitan back-parlour with a box of patent matches; and do what we will, there is always something made to our hand, if it were only our fingers. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是有一些比愚蠢还糟糕的东西张贴在库瑞尔的教堂里。对此“活玫瑰经社团”（之前我从没听说过）难辞其咎。根据印刷的告示，该组织于1832年1月17日由格里高利十六世教皇下旨建立：根据一幅彩色的浮雕，这个协会又好像是在另一个时间，由于圣母赠送给圣多米尼克的一副串珠，童年的救世主也送给锡耶纳的圣凯瑟琳一副串珠而建立的。格里高利教皇并不是十分令人难忘，但是他的年代比较近。我分辨不清这个组织是只举行宗教仪式还是也从事慈善活动；至少它相当有组织性：当月，每周都有十四位主妇和小姐成为副手，另外由一位已婚妇女担任领衔，代表整个团体的领导人泽拉特里斯。在完成协会的规定仪式后，接下来是全体和部分的免罪仪式。“部分免罪仪式伴随着背诵玫瑰经。”在“朗诵十段规定的祷文”之后，部分免罪仪式随即开始。当人们手持银行存折为天国吟诵的时候，我通常很担心，唯恐他们在与同胞交往的时候，会遵循同样的商业精神，这将会使此生变得可悲又肮脏。</td>
		<td class="en">But there was something worse than foolishness placarded in Creil Church. The Association of the Living Rosary2 (of which I had never previously heard) is responsible for that. This Association was founded, according to the printed advertisement, by a brief of Pope Gregory Sixteenth, on the 17th of January 1832: according to a coloured bas-relief, it seems to have been founded, sometime other, by the Virgin giving one rosary to Saint Dominic, and the Infant Saviour giving another to Saint Catharine of Siena. Pope Gregory is not so imposing, but he is nearer hand. I could not distinctly make out whether the Association was entirely devotional, or had an eye to good works; at least it is highly organised: the names of fourteen matrons and misses were filled in for each week of the month as associates, with one other, generally a married woman, at the top for Zélatrice3: the leader of the band. Indulgences, plenary and partial, follow on the performance of the duties of the Association. ‘The partial indulgences are attached to the recitation of the rosary.’ On ‘the recitation of the required dizaine,’ a partial indulgence promptly follows. When people serve the kingdom of heaven with a passbook in their hands, I should always be afraid lest they should carry the same commercial spirit into their dealings with their fellow-men, which would make a sad and sordid business of this life. </td></tr>

They cannot look so merely ugly and mean to the faithful as they do to me. I see that as clearly as a proposition in Euclid4. For these believers are neither weak nor wicked. They can put up their tablet commanding Saint Joseph for his despatch, as if he were still a village carpenter; they can ‘recite the required dizaine,’ and metaphorically pocket the indulgence, as if they had done a job for Heaven; and then they can go out and look down unabashed upon this wonderful river flowing by, and up without confusion at the pin-point stars, which are themselves great worlds full of flowing rivers greater than the Oise.

		<td class="en">We made Precy about sundown. The plain is rich with tufts of poplar. In a wide, luminous curve, the Oise lay under the hillside. A faint mist began to rise and confound the different distances together. There was not a sound audible but that of the sheep-bells in some meadows by the river, and the creaking of a cart down the long road that descends the hill. The villas in their gardens, the shops along the street, all seemed to have been deserted the day before; and I felt inclined to walk discreetly as one feels in a silent forest. All of a sudden, we came round a corner, and there, in a little green round the church, was a bevy of girls in Parisian costumes playing croquet. Their laughter, and the hollow sound of ball and mallet, made a cheery stir in the neighbourhood; and the look of these slim figures, all corseted and ribboned, produced an answerable disturbance in our hearts. We were within sniff of Paris, it seemed. And here were females of our own species playing croquet, just as if Precy had been a place in real life, instead of a stage in the fairyland of travel. For, to be frank, the peasant woman is scarcely to be counted as a woman at all, and after having passed by such a succession of people in petticoats digging and hoeing and making dinner, this company of coquettes under arms made quite a surprising feature in the landscape, and convinced us at once of being fallible males. </td></tr>

We found pieces of loo-warm pork among the salad, and pieces of unknown yielding substance in the ragout. The butcher entertained us with pictures of Parisian life, with which he professed himself well acquainted; the brother sitting the while on the edge of the billiard-table, toppling precariously, and sucking the stump of a cigar.

		<td class="en">It was the most absurd contention. The show-people had set out a certain number of benches; and all who sat upon them were to pay a couple of sous1 for the accommodation. They were always quite full—a bumper house—as long as nothing was going forward; but let the show-woman appear with an eye to a collection, and at the first rattle of her tambourine the audience slipped off the seats, and stood round on the outside with their hands in their pockets. It certainly would have tried an angel’s temper. The showman roared from the proscenium; he had been all over France, and nowhere, nowhere, ‘not even on the borders of Germany,’ had he met with such misconduct. Such thieves and rogues and rascals, as he called them! And every now and again, the wife issued on another round, and added her shrill quota to the tirade. I remarked here, as elsewhere, how far more copious is the female mind in the material of insult. The audience laughed in high good-humour over the man’s declamations; but they bridled and cried aloud under the woman’s pungent sallies. She picked out the sore points. She had the honour of the village at her mercy. Voices answered her angrily out of the crowd, and received a smarting retort for their trouble. A couple of old ladies beside me, who had duly paid for their seats, waxed very red and indignant, and discoursed to each other audibly about the impudence of these mountebanks; but as soon as the show-woman caught a whisper of this, she was down upon them with a swoop: if mesdames could persuade their neighbours to act with common honesty, the mountebanks, she assured them, would be polite enough: mesdames had probably had their bowl of soup, and perhaps a glass of wine that evening; the mountebanks also had a taste for soup, and did not choose to have their little earnings stolen from them before their eyes.

Any stroller must be dear to the right-thinking heart; if it were only as a living protest against offices and the mercantile spirit, and as something to remind us that life is not by necessity the kind of thing we generally make it. Even a German band, if you see it leaving town in the early morning for a campaign in country places, among trees and meadows, has a romantic flavour for the imagination. There is nobody, under thirty, so dead but his heart will stir a little at sight of a gypsies’ camp. ‘We are not cotton-spinners all’; or, at least, not all through.

But if a man is only so much of an actor that he can stumble through a farce, he is made free of a new order of thoughts. He has something else to think about beside the money-box. He has a pride of his own, and, what is of far more importance, he has an aim before him that he can never quite attain. He has gone upon a pilgrimage that will last him his life long, because there is no end to it short of perfection. He will better upon himself a little day by day; or even if he has given up the attempt, he will always remember that once upon a time he had conceived this high ideal, that once upon a time he had fallen in love with a star. ’Tis better to have loved and lost.’2 Although the moon should have nothing to say to Endymion3, although he should settle down with Audrey4 and feed pigs, do you not think he would move with a better grace, and cherish higher thoughts to the end?

It looked more finished; more of the spirit looked out through it; it had a living, expressive air, and you could see that his eyes took things in. My companion and I wondered greatly who and what he could be.

There was a father and mother; two daughters, brazen, blowsy hussies, who sang and acted, without an idea of how to set about either; and a dark young man, like a tutor, a recalcitrant house-painter, who sang and acted not amiss. The mother was the genius of the party, so far as genius can be spoken of with regard to such a pack of incompetent humbugs; and her husband could not find words to express his admiration for her comic countryman. ‘You should see my old woman,’ said he, and nodded his beery countenance. One night they performed in the stable-yard, with flaring lamps—a wretched exhibition, coldly looked upon by a village audience. Next night, as soon as the lamps were lighted, there came a plump of rain, and they had to sweep away their baggage as fast as possible, and make off to the barn where they harboured, cold, wet, and supperless. In the morning, a dear friend of mine, who has as warm a heart for strollers as I have myself, made a little collection, and sent it by my hands to comfort them for their disappointment.

He was once an actor in the Châtelet5; but he contracted a nervous affection from the heat and glare of the footlights, which unfitted him for the stage. At this crisis Mademoiselle Ferrario, otherwise Mademoiselle Rita of the Alcazar, agreed to share his wandering fortunes. ‘I could never forget the generosity of that lady,’ said he. He wears trousers so tight that it has long been a problem to all who knew him how he manages to get in and out of them. He sketches a little in water-colours; he writes verses; he is the most patient of fishermen, and spent long days at the bottom of the inn-garden fruitlessly dabbling a line in the clear river. </td></tr>

For it was no longer ago than last night, perhaps, that the receipts only amounted to a franc and a half, to cover three francs of railway fare and two of board and lodging. The Maire, a man worth a million of money, sat in the front seat, repeatedly applauding Mlle. Ferrario, and yet gave no more than three sous the whole evening. Local authorities look with such an evil eye upon the strolling artist. Alas! I know it well, who have been myself taken for one, and pitilessly incarcerated on the strength of the misapprehension. Once, M. de Vauversin visited a commissary of police for permission to sing. The commissary, who was smoking at his ease, politely doffed his hat upon the singer’s entrance. ‘Mr. Commissary,’ he began, ‘I am an artist.’ And on went the commissary’s hat again. No courtesy for the companions of Apollo6! ‘They are as degraded as that,’ said M. de Vauversin with a sweep of his cigarette. </td></tr>

Some one said, it would be better to have a million of money down, and Mlle.

I had an art, in which I have done things well—as well as some—better perhaps than others; and now it is closed against me. I must go about the country gathering coppers and singing nonsense. Do you think I regret my life? Do you think I would rather be a fat burgess, like a calf? Not I! I have had moments when I have been applauded on the boards: I think nothing of that; but I have known in my own mind sometimes, when I had not a clap from the whole house, that I had found a true intonation, or an exact and speaking gesture; and then, messieurs, I have known what pleasure was, what it was to do a thing well, what it was to be an artist. And to know what art is, is to have an interest for ever, such as no burgess can find in his petty concerns. Tenez, messieurs, je vais vous le dire—it is like a religion.’ </td></tr>

Nothing particular took place during the two or three acts that I sat out; but you will be pleased to learn that the unities were properly respected, and the whole piece, with one exception, moved in harmony with classical rules. That exception was the comic countryman, a lean marionnette in wooden shoes, who spoke in prose and in a broad patois much appreciated by the audience.

But the villagers of Précy seemed delighted. Indeed, so long as a thing is an exhibition, and you pay to see it, it is nearly certain to amuse.
