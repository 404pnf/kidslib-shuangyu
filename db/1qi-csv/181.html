		<td class="en">by Jack London</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这样，我给六条毯子，暖和的双人毯；六把锉刀，又大又坚硬的锉刀；六把哈得孙湾刀，刀长刃利；两条独木舟，是毛噶生产制造的；十条狗，肩膀厚实，狗具结实；还有三把枪——其中一个扳机坏了，但还是把好枪，肯定能修好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Thus will I give six blankets, warm and double; six files, large and hard; six Hudson Bay knives, keen-edged and long; two canoes, the work of Mogum, The Maker of Things; ten dogs, heavy-shouldered and strong in the harness; and three guns—the trigger of one be broken, but it is a good gun and can doubtless be mended.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基斯停了下来，扫视周围那一张张神情专注的脸庞。正值捕鱼的时节，他向葛诺布出价，想要娶他的女儿苏苏。这里是育空地区的圣乔治教区，各部落都聚集在一起，绵延了数百英里。他们从东西南北聚集而来，甚至托齐卡卡特部落和遥远的塔纳闹部落的人都来了。　　　</td>
		<td class="en">Keesh paused and swept his eyes over the circle of intent faces.It was the time of the Great Fishing, and he was bidding to Gnob for Su-Su his daughter.The place was the St. George Mission by the Yukon, and the tribes had gathered for many a hundred miles.From north, south, east, and west they had come, even from Tozikakat and far Tana-naw.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还有，葛诺布，你是塔纳闹部落的首领，而我基斯，老基斯的儿子，是斯拉盖特部落的首领。　　　因此，当我的后代在你女儿腹中孕育之时，也是我们部落之间的友谊，伟大的友谊建立之日，而将来塔纳闹和斯拉盖特部落会成为血脉相连的兄弟。我说过要去做的事情，我都会做的。那么在这件事情上，葛诺布，你怎么看呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And further, O Gnob, thou art chief of the Tana-naw; and I, Keesh, the son of Keesh, am chief of the Thlunget.Wherefore, when my seed springs from the loins of thy daughter, there shall be a friendship between the tribes, a great friendship, and Tana-naw and Thlunget shall be brothers of the blood in the time to come.What I have said I will do, that will I do.And how is it with you, O Gnob, in this matter?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >葛诺布郑重地点头，他粗糙沧桑的脸高深莫测地掩盖了隐藏在后的心灵。他的小眼睛像两块煤块，透过眼睛的狭缝燃烧了起来，他用非常嘶哑的声音尖声说道：“但这还不够。”</td>
		<td class="en">Gnob nodded his head gravely, his gnarled and age-twisted face inscrutably masking the soul that dwelt behind.His narrow eyes burned like twin coals through their narrow slits, as he piped in a high-cracked voice, “But that is not all.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还要什么？”基斯问，“我提供的东西还不够充足吗？还有别的哪个塔纳闹部落少女值过这个大价钱吗？说出她的名字来！”</td>
		<td class="en">“What more?” Keesh demanded.“Have I not offered full measure?Was there ever yet a Tana-naw maiden who fetched so great a price?Then name her!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人群中传来一阵窃笑，基斯知道自己在这群人面前丢脸了。</td>
		<td class="en">An open snicker passed round the circle, and Keesh knew that he stood in shame before these people.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有，没有，我的好基斯，你没弄明白。”葛诺布做了一个轻抚的手势。“价格公道。这是个好价钱。我也不是对这个坏扳机有疑问。但这还不够。你这个人怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nay, nay, good Keesh, thou dost not understand.”Gnob made a soft, stroking gesture.“The price is fair.It is a good price.Nor do I question the broken trigger.But that is not all.What of the man?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，你这个人怎么样？”人群中传来阵阵咆哮声。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ay, what of the man?” the circle snarled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“据说，”葛诺布发出尖锐的声音，“据说你和老基斯办事套路可不一样。据说你在黑暗中跟着奇怪的神灵游荡，而且你自己也变得很害怕他们。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is said,” Gnob’s shrill voice piped, “it is said that Keesh does not walk in the way of his fathers.It is said that he has wandered into the dark, after strange gods, and that he is become afraid.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基斯的脸色变得难看起来。“那是胡说！”他大声喊道，“我基斯不害怕任何人！”</td>
		<td class="en">The face of Keesh went dark.“It is a lie!” he thundered.“Keesh is afraid of no man!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“据说，”老葛诺布继续说，“你在监狱里听了白人的演讲，还向白人的神灵低头致敬，还有，白人的神灵不喜欢你的血。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is said,” old Gnob piped on, “that he has harkened to the speech of the white man up at the Big House, and that he bends head to the white man’s god, and, moreover, that blood is displeasing to the white man’s god.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基斯低下眼帘，情绪激动地紧紧握着拳。那群野蛮的人嘲笑他，萨满巫师马德万在葛诺布的耳边低语，他是部落里的大祭司，并负责制作药剂。</td>
		<td class="en">Keesh dropped his eyes, and his hands clenched passionately.The savage circle laughed derisively, and in the ear of Gnob whispered Madwan, the shaman, high-priest of the tribe and maker of medicine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >萨满巫师穿过火光边缘的阴影挤了出来，拉起来一个瘦弱的小男孩，让他和基斯面对面，然后往基斯的手里塞了一把刀。</td>
		<td class="en">The shaman poked among the shadows on the rim of the firelight and roused up a slender young boy, whom he brought face to face with Keesh; and in the hand of Keesh he thrust a knife.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >葛诺布向前一倾。“基斯！哦，基斯！难道你不敢杀人吗？看！这是基孜努，一个奴隶。打他，基斯，用你胳膊的力量去打他！”</td>
		<td class="en">Gnob leaned forward.“Keesh!O Keesh!Darest thou to kill a man?Behold!This be Kitz-noo, a slave.Strike, O Keesh, strike with the strength of thy arm!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩浑身颤抖，等着这一击。基斯看着他，布朗先生的高尚情操浮现在他的脑海里，他眼前的景象全是布朗先生地狱之火的独特烙印上那个跳动的火焰。刀子掉在地上，男孩长吁一口气、双膝战栗地走出了火光照亮的地方。葛诺布的脚下趴着一条狼狗，露着闪亮的牙齿，准备扑向男孩。但是萨满巫医把脚伸到这个畜生的身子里，这样做让葛诺布想出了一个主意。</td>
		<td class="en">The boy trembled and waited the stroke.Keesh looked at him, and thoughts of Mr. Brown’s higher morality floated through his mind, and strong upon him was a vision of the leaping flames of Mr. Brown’s particular brand of hell-fire.The knife fell to the ground, and the boy sighed and went out beyond the firelight with shaking knees.At the feet of Gnob sprawled a wolf-dog, which bared its gleaming teeth and prepared to spring after the boy.But the shaman ground his foot into the brute’s body, and so doing, gave Gnob an idea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，基斯，如果有人这样对你，你会怎么办？”——他边说着，边把一段大马哈鱼向狼狗白牙扔去，在狗想要去接的时候，他拿棍子朝它的鼻子狠狠地敲了一棒。“然后呢，基斯，你会这么做吗？”——白牙蜷着身子退回去，向葛诺布的手摇尾乞怜。</td>
		<td class="en">“And then, O Keesh, what wouldst thou do, should a man do this thing to you?”—as he spoke, Gnob held a ribbon of salmon to White Fang, and when the animal attempted to take it, smote him sharply on the nose with a stick.“And afterward, O Keesh, wouldst thou do thus?”—White Fang was cringing back on his belly and fawning to the hand of Gnob.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听着！”倚在马德万胳膊上的葛诺布已经站了起来，“我已经很老了，而正因为我老了，我可以跟你讲讲道理。你的父亲基斯，是个伟大的人。他非常喜欢战争中弓弦的声音，在场的人都曾亲眼看见他把矛刺向敌人，直到对方身首异处。但你不像他。自从你离开乌鸦镇去崇拜狼镇，你就开始变得怕血，于是你部落的人也跟着害怕。这可不好。看啊，当我还是个男孩子时，甚至就像基孜努那么大，这片土地上从来没有白人出现。而后这些白人一个个地来了，直到现在已经有许多了。他们是个不安分的种族，从不满足于填饱肚子在火炉边休息，明天的事明天再操心。看起来他们被下了诅咒，而他们必须历经艰难困苦才能找到破解这个诅咒的方法。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Listen!”—leaning on the arm of Madwan, Gnob had risen to his feet.“I am very old, and because I am very old I will tell thee things.Thy father, Keesh, was a mighty man.And he did love the song of the bowstring in battle, and these eyes have beheld him cast a spear till the head stood out beyond a man’s body.But thou art unlike.Since thou left the Raven to worship the Wolf, thou art become afraid of blood, and thou makest thy people afraid.This is not good.For behold, when I was a boy, even as Kitz-noo there, there was no white man in all the land.But they came, one by one, these white men, till now they are many.And they are a restless breed, never content to rest by the fire with a full belly and let the morrow bring its own meat.A curse was laid upon them, it would seem, and they must work it out in toil and hardship.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基斯震惊了。他模糊地记起布朗先生讲的关于古时候一个叫亚当的人的故事，看来布朗先生讲的都是真的。</td>
		<td class="en">Keesh was startled.A recollection of a hazy story told by Mr. Brown of one Adam, of old time, came to him, and it seemed that Mr. Brown had spoken true.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“所以他们无论看见什么都要插手，这些白人到处走，到处看。他们下一步只会越来越过分，如果我们听之任之，他们会霸占所有的土地，会让乌鸦镇的所有部落都无立足之地。因此我们要和他们交战，直到所有的白人都离开这里。我们只有守住关口和土地，我们的儿女子孙才可能享受繁盛兴旺。如果狼镇和乌鸦镇交战的话，就会有一场恶仗要打，但基斯不会参加战斗，他也不会让他部落的人参加。所以他娶我女儿这事不妥。这就是我葛诺布，塔纳闹部落的首领，要说的内容。”</td>
		<td class="en">“So they lay hands upon all they behold, these white men, and they go everywhere and behold all things.And ever do more follow in their steps, so that if nothing be done they will come to possess all the land and there will be no room for the tribes of the Raven.Wherefore it is meet that we fight with them till none are left.Then will we hold the passes and the land, and perhaps our children and our children’s children shall flourish and grow fat.There is a great struggle to come, when Wolf and Raven shall grapple; but Keesh will not fight, nor will he let his people fight.So it is not well that he should take to him my daughter.Thus have I spoken, I, Gnob, chief of the Tana-naw.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是白人都很和善、很伟大，”基斯答道，“白人教会了我们很多事情。白人给我们毛毯、刀子，还有枪，我们从来没做过这些东西，将来也不可能做出来。我还记得在他们来之前，我们是怎么生活的。那时我还没出生，但我从父亲那里听说了。以前我们打猎时必须偷偷爬到离驼鹿很近的地方，那样把矛扔出去的时候才能扎到它。 现在我们用白人的步枪打猎，射击距离比孩子的哭声传得还要远。我们过去吃鱼、肉和浆果——没有别的可吃——而且我们吃的时候都不加盐。你们这些人当中还有多少人愿意回到吃鱼吃肉不加盐的日子？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But the white men are good and great,” Keesh made answer.“The white men have taught us many things.The white men have given us blankets and knives and guns, such as we have never made and never could make.I remember in what manner we lived before they came.I was unborn then, but I have it from my father.When we went on the hunt we must creep so close to the moose that a spear-cast would cover the distance.To-day we use the white man’s rifle, and farther away than can a child’s cry be heard.We ate fish and meat and berries—there was nothing else to eat—and we ate without salt.How many be there among you who care to go back to the fish and meat without salt?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果不是马德万在全场陷入沉默之前跳了出来，整个气氛就冷到家了。“首先我要问你个问题，基斯。　北部监狱里的白人告诉你杀人是不对的。但谁不知道白人也杀人呢？难道我们忘记科尤库克大战了吗？忘记努克卢克叶托大战中，三个白人杀死了二十个托齐卡卡人了吗？你以为我们不记得白人麦克尔拉思杀死的那三个塔纳闹部落的人了吗？哦，基斯，告诉我，为什么那个巫师布朗教给你打仗是不对的，而他所有的白人兄弟都在打仗呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">It would have sunk home, had not Madwan leaped to his feet ere silence could come.“And first a question to thee, Keesh.The white man up at the Big House tells you that it is wrong to kill.Yet do we not know that the white men kill?Have we forgotten the great fight on the Koyokuk? or the great fight at Nuklukyeto, where three white men killed twenty of the Tozikakats?Do you think we no longer remember the three men of the Tana-naw that the white man Macklewrath killed?Tell me, O Keesh, why does the Shaman Brown teach you that it is wrong to fight, when all his brothers fight?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当基斯还在为这个矛盾挣扎时，葛诺布叫道：“不，不，没必要回答。”“这个问题很简单。大善人布朗紧紧抓着乌鸦镇，而他的兄弟们就来拔乌鸦上的羽毛。”他提高了自己的声音，“但只要塔纳闹部落还有一个男人可以战斗，还有一个女人可以传宗接代，乌鸦镇就不会被欺负！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nay, nay, there is no need to answer,” Gnob piped, while Keesh struggled with the paradox.“It is very simple.The Good Man Brown would hold the Raven tight whilst his brothers pluck the feathers.”He raised his voice.“But so long as there is one Tana-naw to strike a blow, or one maiden to bear a man-child, the Raven shall not be plucked!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >葛诺布转向火堆对面一个健壮的青年。“马卡穆克，你是苏苏的哥哥，你怎么说？”</td>
		<td class="en">Gnob turned to a husky young man across the fire.“And what sayest thou, Makamuk, who art brother to Su-Su?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马卡穆克走上前来。他脸上的长疤牵着他的上唇，所以他看起来总是咧着嘴笑的样子，掩盖了他那灼烈凶狠的眼神。“今天，”他狡猾地岔开了话题，“我是搭商人麦克尔拉思的船来的。在船门内我看见一个小孩在嘲笑太阳。小孩子用商人麦克尔拉思的眼神看着我，那眼神真是可怕。他妈妈向他跑去，让他安静了下来。他的妈妈叫兹斯卡，是斯拉盖特部落的女人。”</td>
		<td class="en">Makamuk came to his feet.A long face-scar lifted his upper lip into a perpetual grin which belied the glowing ferocity of his eyes.“This day,” he began with cunning irrelevance, “I came by the Trader Macklewrath’s cabin.And in the door I saw a child laughing at the sun.And the child looked at me with the Trader Macklewrath’s eyes, and it was frightened.The mother ran to it and quieted it.The mother was Ziska, the Thlunget woman.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人群中爆发出愤怒的咆哮声，淹没了马卡穆克的声音。而他戏剧性地转向基斯，伸出胳膊，手指着基斯，这让人群安静了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">A snarl of rage rose up and drowned his voice, which he stilled by turning dramatically upon Keesh with outstretched arm and accusing finger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“所以呢？你们斯拉盖特部落人把自己的女人给别人，然后再到我们塔纳闹部落来要女人？但是，基斯，我们自己也需要女人，因为我们必须繁衍后代，许多许多后代，为狼镇和乌鸦镇开战的那一天储备兵力。”</td>
		<td class="en">“So?You give your women away, you Thlunget, and come to the Tana-naw for more?But we have need of our women, Keesh; for we must breed men, many men, against the day when the Raven grapples with the Wolf.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >葛诺布的尖叫穿透了人群中爆发的雷鸣般的欢呼声，清晰响亮。“诺萨布克，苏苏最喜欢你这个哥哥了，你的意见呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">Through the storm of applause, Gnob’s voice shrilled clear.“And thou, Nossabok, who art her favorite brother?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个年轻人身材消瘦、风度翩翩，长着坚挺的鹰钩鼻和典型的高挑的眉毛，但因为有些紧张，一只眼的眼皮时不时地低垂，似有暗示地眨着眼睛。即使他抬起眼的时候，眼皮也会低垂，碰着脸颊闭上一会儿。但人们这次并没有如往常那样笑声相迎。每个人都神情凝重。“我也是搭麦克尔拉思商船来的。”他用女孩般轻柔的声音回答说。这声音听着很年轻，也很像他的妹妹。“我看见印第安人的汗水流进眼睛里，他们的膝盖疲惫得直发抖——我是说，我看见印第安人在麦克尔拉思用来建造商店的原木下呻吟。我亲眼看到，为了让巫师布朗的监狱在霜冻的夜里依然暖和，他们不停地劈木柴。这是女人干的活。塔纳闹部落人绝不做这样的事。我们是血脉相连的兄弟，不是女人；你们斯拉盖特部落才都是女人。”　　　</td>
		<td class="en">The young fellow was slender and graceful, with the strong aquiline nose and high brows of his type; but from some nervous affliction the lid of one eye drooped at odd times in a suggestive wink.Even as he arose it so drooped and rested a moment against his cheek.But it was not greeted with the accustomed laughter.Every face was grave.“I, too, passed by the Trader Macklewrath’s cabin,” he rippled in soft, girlish tones, wherein there was much of youth and much of his sister.“And I saw Indians with the sweat running into their eyes and their knees shaking with weariness—I say, I saw Indians groaning under the logs for the store which the Trader Macklewrath is to build.And with my eyes I saw them chopping wood to keep the Shaman Brown’s Big House warm through the frost of the long nights.This be squaw work.Never shall the Tana-naw do the like.We shall be blood brothers to men, not squaws; and the Thlunget be squaws.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >全场鸦雀无声，所有的目光聚集到基斯身上。他故意仔细盯着基斯周围的人看，凝视着这些成年人的脸。“所以，”他冷漠地说，“所以。”他重复道。然后他什么也没再说，抬脚离开了人群，走向了阴暗处。</td>
		<td class="en">A deep silence fell, and all eyes centred on Keesh.He looked about him carefully, deliberately, full into the face of each grown man.“So,” he said passionlessly.And “So,” he repeated.Then turned on his heel without further word and passed out into the darkness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他费力地穿过爬行的婴儿和竖起毛的狼狗，走向大帐，在帐边借着火光他看见一个女人在干活。她用从蔓生的藤条的根部扒下的一股股皮条来编打渔的绳子。有一段时间，他就这么静静地看着她灵巧的双手把一堆杂乱卷曲的纤维编成整齐的鱼线。她很好看，干活的时候身子歪向一边，四肢健硕，胸部丰满，臀部看起来很适合生孩子。她铜色的脸在闪烁的火光映衬下变成金黄色，她的头发是蓝黑色的，眼睛又黑又亮。</td>
		<td class="en">Wading among sprawling babies and bristling wolf-dogs, he threaded the great camp, and on its outskirts came upon a woman at work by the light of a fire.With strings of bark stripped from the long roots of creeping vines, she was braiding rope for the Fishing.For some time, without speech, he watched her deft hands bringing law and order out of the unruly mass of curling fibres.She was good to look upon, swaying there to her task, strong-limbed, deep-chested, and with hips made for motherhood.And the bronze of her face was golden in the flickering light, her hair blue-black, her eyes jet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，苏苏，”他最终还是开口了，“在过去的日子里你对我很好，在以后我们还年轻的日子里——”</td>
		<td class="en">“O Su-Su,” he spoke finally, “thou hast looked upon me kindly in the days that have gone and in the days yet young—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我对你不错是因为你是斯拉盖特部落的首领，”她立马回答说，“还因为你高大强壮。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I looked kindly upon thee for that thou wert chief of the Thlunget,” she answered quickly, “and because thou wert big and strong.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ay—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但那是在过去捕鱼的时候了，”她又急忙补充说，“在巫师布朗来这里、教你邪恶的东西、把你引向歧路之前。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But that was in the old days of the Fishing,” she hastened to add, “before the Shaman Brown came and taught thee ill things and led thy feet on strange trails.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但我告诉你——”</td>
		<td class="en">“But I would tell thee the—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她举起一只手，用这个姿势提醒他她的父亲就在旁边。“不，我已经知道在你喉咙里搅动的言论了，基斯，我现在就能回答你。凑巧的是，水里的鱼和林里的野兽都要繁衍后代。这是好事。同样，女生也要生孩子。女人要繁衍后代，即使是没结婚的姑娘也会感觉到生育的剧痛、胸部的疼痛和缠在脖颈上孩子的小手。当这种感觉变得强烈时，每个少女都会秘密地在自己四周寻找那个人——将来适合做孩子父亲的那个男人。我也是这么想的。我看见你时也是这样，我觉得你高大健壮，狩猎、捕兽、作战都是好手，在我怀孕需要吃两个人的饭时能让我吃饱，在我感到无助的时候让我远离危险。但那都是在巫师布朗来这里之前，他教你——”</td>
		<td class="en">She held up one hand in a gesture which reminded him of her father.“Nay, I know already the speech that stirs in thy throat, O Keesh, and I make answer now.It so happeneth that the fish of the water and the beasts of the forest bring forth after their kind.And this is good.Likewise it happeneth to women.It is for them to bring forth their kind, and even the maiden, while she is yet a maiden, feels the pang of the birth, and the pain of the breast, and the small hands at the neck.And when such feeling is strong, then does each maiden look about her with secret eyes for the man—for the man who shall be fit to father her kind.So have I felt.So did I feel when I looked upon thee and found thee big and strong, a hunter and fighter of beasts and men, well able to win meat when I should eat for two, well able to keep danger afar off when my helplessness drew nigh.But that was before the day the Shaman Brown came into the land and taught thee—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是，苏苏，你说的不对。在这件事上，我必须得说点好话——”</td>
		<td class="en">“But it is not right, Su-Su.I have it on good word—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“杀人是不对的。我知道你要说什么。那就娶你和你同类的人吧，那种不杀人的人，但别再来塔纳闹部族提亲了。因为据说再过不久，乌鸦镇和狼镇就要开战了。我不了解，因为这是男人们的事；但我知道我需要在战争到来之前生孩子。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is not right to kill.I know what thou wouldst say.Then breed thou after thy kind, the kind that does not kill; but come not on such quest among the Tana-naw.For it is said in the time to come, that the Raven shall grapple with the Wolf.I do not know, for this be the affair of men; but I do know that it is for me to bring forth men against that time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“苏苏，”基斯打断了她，“你必须听我说——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Su-Su,” Keesh broke in, “thou must hear me—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真正的男人会拿棍子打我让我听话，”她讥笑地说，“但你……接着！”她把一束皮条塞到他手里，“我不能嫁给你，但这个可以给你。在你手里看起来正合适。这是女人的活，你拿去编完吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A man would beat me with a stick and make me hear,” she sneered.“But thou...here!”She thrust a bunch of bark into his hand.“I cannot give thee myself, but this, yes.It looks fittest in thy hands.It is squaw work, so braid away.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把那皮条猛地一扔，愤怒令他铜色皮肤下的血脉喷张。</td>
		<td class="en">He flung it from him, the angry blood pounding a muddy path under his bronze.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还有一件事，”她接着说，“有一个古老的习俗，你父亲和我父亲都很熟悉。当男人在战场上战败时，他的头皮会被剥下当作战利品。很好。但你由于已经放弃了乌鸦镇，就必须做得更多。你要给我的不是头皮，而是人头，两颗人头，而那时我将给你的不是皮条，而是勇士珠带、刀鞘和俄国长刀。然后我会再次亲切地待你，一切都会好起来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“One thing more,” she went on.“There be an old custom which thy father and mine were not strangers to.When a man falls in battle, his scalp is carried away in token.Very good.But thou, who have forsworn the Raven, must do more.Thou must bring me, not scalps, but heads, two heads, and then will I give thee, not bark, but a brave-beaded belt, and sheath, and long Russian knife.Then will I look kindly upon thee once again, and all will be well.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“所以，”这个男人沉思着，“所以。”然后他转身，走出了光亮的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">“So,” the man pondered.“So.”Then he turned and passed out through the light.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，基斯！”她在后面叫他，“不是两颗人头，最少三个！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nay, O Keesh!” she called after him.“Not two heads, but three at least!”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But Keesh remained true to his conversion, lived uprightly, and made his tribespeople obey the gospel as propounded by the Rev. Jackson Brown.Through all the time of the Fishing he gave no heed to the Tana-naw, nor took notice of the sly things which were said, nor of the laughter of the women of the many tribes.After the Fishing, Gnob and his people, with great store of salmon, sun-dried and smoke-cured, departed for the Hunting on the head reaches of the Tana-naw.Keesh watched them go, but did not fail in his attendance at Mission service, where he prayed regularly and led the singing with his deep bass voice.</td></tr>

Jackson Brown delighted in that deep bass voice, and because of his sterling qualities deemed him the most promising convert.Macklewrath doubted this.He did not believe in the efficacy of the conversion of the heathen, and he was not slow in speaking his mind.But Mr. Brown was a large man, in his way, and he argued it out with such convincingness, all of one long fall night, that the trader, driven from position after position, finally announced in desperation, “Knock out my brains with apples, Brown, if I don’t become a convert myself, if Keesh holds fast, true blue, for two years!”Mr. Brown never lost an opportunity, so he clinched the matter on the spot with a virile hand-grip, and thenceforth the conduct of Keesh was to determine the ultimate abiding-place of Macklewrath’s soul.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">By a fire, before one of the lodges, five pairs of snow-shoes stood on end in their element, and by the fire sat Su-Su.The hood of her squirrel-skin parka was about her hair, and well drawn up around her throat; but her hands were unmittened and nimbly at work with needle and sinew, completing the last fantastic design on a belt of leather faced with bright scarlet cloth.A dog, somewhere at the rear of one of the lodges, raised a short, sharp bark, then ceased as abruptly as it had begun.Once, her father, in the lodge at her back, gurgled and grunted in his sleep.“Bad dreams,” she smiled to herself.“He grows old, and that last joint was too much.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">She placed the last bead, knotted the sinew, and replenished the fire.Then, after gazing long into the flames, she lifted her head to the harsh crunch-crunch of a moccasined foot against the flinty snow granules.Keesh was at her side, bending slightly forward to a load which he bore upon his back.This was wrapped loosely in a soft-tanned moosehide, and he dropped it carelessly into the snow and sat down.They looked at each other long and without speech.</td></tr>

There she paused and took a long look about her, at the rimming forest, at the faint stars in the sky, at the camp, at the snow-shoes in the snow—a last long comprehensive look at life.A light breeze stirred her hair from the side, and for the space of one deep breath she turned her head and followed it around until she met it full-faced.</td></tr>
