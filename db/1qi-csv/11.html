		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天，出门散步是不可能的了。其实，我们早晨还在寸草不生的灌木丛里闲逛了一小时；但自从午饭后（没有客人造访时，里德夫人就会早些用餐），便刮起了冬日的寒风，接着乌云满天，大雨倾盆，户外活动也就此作罢。</td>
		<td class="en">There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.   We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我倒是很高兴。我从来都不喜欢远距离散步，尤其是在寒冷的下午。一想到在阴冷的黄昏回到家，手脚都冻麻了，还要受到保姆贝西的责备，又觉得自己体力不如伊莱扎、约翰和乔治亚娜，心里既难过又惭愧，这情形是很糟的。</td>
		<td class="en">I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，前面提到的伊莱扎、约翰和乔治亚娜正在客厅里，围着他们的妈妈。她则斜靠在火炉边的沙发上，身边是自己的宝贝儿们（他们此时既没争吵也没哭闹），看起来十分幸福。至于我，她批准我不必加入他们。说她很遗憾，不得不让我离得远一点儿。但是，直到她从贝西那里听到并亲眼见到，我在努力认真地培养更加随和、天真的性情，更加活泼、可爱的举止——更轻松、率真、自然，可以这么说——那她就真得剥夺我享受那些只有快乐知足的孩子才配拥有的特权了。</td>
		<td class="en">The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“贝西跟你说我干什么了？”我问。</td>
		<td class="en">“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“简，我不喜欢吹毛求疵或刨根问底的人；而且，一个小孩子这么跟长辈说话，实在让人讨厌。找个地方坐下，不会好好说话就保持沉默。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >客厅隔壁是吃早饭的地方，我便溜了进去。那里有个书柜，我很快就拿了一本，特意挑了一本满是插图的。我爬上窗台，把脚缩起来，像土耳其人那样盘腿坐着；我把红色的波纹窗帘几乎拉严实了，这使我加倍隐蔽。</td>
		<td class="en">A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures.I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我右边，绯红色窗幔的褶皱挡住了我的视线；我的左边则是明亮的玻璃窗，它保护我免受十一月阴沉天气的侵害，又没把我与其隔离开。在我翻书的时候，我会时不时地看看冬日下午的景色。只见远处是一片白茫茫的云雾；近处是一片湿漉漉的草坪和被暴风雨打过的灌木丛。一阵长久而凄厉的狂风，驱赶着无止无息的大雨，横扫而过。</td>
		<td class="en">Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day.At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我又回到了书中——比伊克的《英国鸟类史》。我对书的正文通常不是很感兴趣，但是有几页导言，虽说我只是个孩子，我却不能当作空白页那样一翻而过。书中写到了海鸟的栖息地；写到了只有它们才居住的“孤单的岩石和海岬”；写到了从最南端的林纳斯尼斯或纳斯，到北角都布满岛屿的挪威海岸——</td>
		<td class="en">I returned to my book—Bewick’s @History of British Birds@: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of “the solitary rocks and promontories” by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在那里，北冰洋的巨大漩涡，咆哮在极地荒芜、凄凉的小岛周围；大西洋的巨浪奔涌到狂风暴雨的赫布里底群岛。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我也不能把有些地方忽略过去，那就是书中提到的拉普兰、西伯利亚、斯匹次卑尔根群岛、新地岛、冰岛和格陵兰岛的荒凉海岸。“广袤无垠的北极地带和那些阴森的不毛之地——是冰雪的贮存处，经过几个世纪的冬天的积累，冰层坚固得像阿尔卑斯山的层层高峰，包围着极地，光滑耀眼，把与日俱增的寒冷都聚集到一起。”对于这些死白色的地域，我已有自己的看法，却很朦胧，如同浮现在孩子们头脑中的一些一知半解的念头，模糊，但却出奇地令人难忘。这几页导言中的文字，配合着后面的插图，使得独自矗立在破涛汹涌的大海中的岩石，搁浅在荒凉海岸上的破船，以及那透过云层俯视着沉船的凄冷惨淡的月光，更加意味深长。</td>
		<td class="en">Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children’s brains, but strangely impressive.The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我说不清墓地周围弥漫着一种什么样的情愫。刻有铭文的墓碑、一扇门、两棵树、低低的地平线、环绕四周的残垣断壁，和那一轮刚刚升起的新月，表明正是薄暮时分。</td>
		<td class="en">I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两艘轮船静静地躺在平静的海面上，我以为那是海上的鬼影。</td>
		<td class="en">The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >魔鬼从后面按住窃贼的背包，那情形十分可怕，我迅速翻了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还有那长着黑角的怪物，独坐在岩石上，审视着远处围着绞刑架的一群人，样子也很可怕。</td>
		<td class="en">So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每一张图都讲述了一个故事；由于我理解力不足，欣赏水平不够，它们显得神秘莫测，但却非常生动有趣。和贝西有时在冬夜讲的故事一样有趣，当然得赶上她心情好；每当这时，贝西会把熨衣架搬到保育室的壁炉旁，让我们围着坐下。她一边烫着里德太太的蕾丝饰边，把睡帽的边沿烫出褶皱，一边给我们讲一段段出自古老的神话或其他歌谣的爱情和冒险故事，我们迫不及待地听着。或者（像我后来发现的），有一些出自《帕美拉》和《莫兰伯爵亨利》。</td>
		<td class="en">Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of @Pamela@, and @Henry, Earl of Moreland@.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当时，我的膝头放着比伊克的书，感到非常高兴，至少是自得其乐。我最怕被打扰，但打扰总是来得很快。餐厅的门开了。</td>
		<td class="en">With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘘！忧愁小姐！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Boh! Madam Mope!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰·里德喊道，接着他又打住了，显然发现房间里空无一人。</td>
		<td class="en">cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“见鬼，她到哪儿去了！”他继续说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Where the dickens is she!”he continued.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“丽茜！乔琪！（喊他的姐妹）</td>
		<td class="en">“Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >琼不在这儿，告诉妈妈她跑到雨里去了——这个坏畜生！”</td>
		<td class="en">Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“幸好我拉好了窗帘。”我想，我真希望他找不到我的藏身之处。约翰·里德自己肯定是发现不了的；他眼睛不尖，头脑也不灵光；但是伊莱扎刚在门口探进头来，就立刻喊道：</td>
		<td class="en">“It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她在窗台上呢，肯定的，杰克。”</td>
		<td class="en">“She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是我立刻出来了，因为一想到要被这个杰克拽出来，我就不寒而栗。</td>
		<td class="en">And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么事呀？”我问，既尴尬又不安。</td>
		<td class="en">“What do you want?”I asked, with awkward diffidence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要说‘什么事呀，里德少爷？’”这便是我得到的回答。“我想让你过来。”他坐到扶手椅上，做了个手势，意思是让我走过去站在他面前。</td>
		<td class="en">“Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’” was the answer.“I want you to come here;” and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰·里德是个十四岁的小学生，比我大四岁，而我只有十岁；他长得比同龄人要高大结实，肤色灰暗，一副病相；宽脸盘，五官粗犷，四肢沉重而肥大。他习惯性地暴饮暴食，这使得他肝火很旺，眼睛黯淡迟钝，双颊松弛。他现在本应该在学校，但是“由于身体欠佳”，他妈妈把他领回家住一两个月。他的老师迈尔斯先生断言，如果家里能少送些点心和糖果，他会很好的。但是做母亲的心里讨厌这种刻薄的建议，而倾向于一种更文雅的想法，认为约翰的蜡黄脸色是由于用功过度，或者可能是想家导致的。</td>
		<td class="en">John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities.He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two,“on account of his delicate health.”Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John’s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰对他母亲和姐妹们没有多少感情，对我则很厌恶。他欺负我，虐待我，一周都不只两三次，一天也不只一两次，而是经常如此。我的每根神经都惧怕他，他走近时，我身上的每块肌肉都会收缩起来。有时候我会被他吓得手足无措，因为面对他的威胁和欺负，我无处倾诉。仆人们不愿站在我这边而得罪他们的小主人。里德夫人对此则装聋作哑，她从来都没看到或听到她儿子打骂我，尽管约翰有时当着她的面欺负我，她不在的时候就更变本加厉了。</td>
		<td class="en">John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me.He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions;the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我已经习惯性地顺从于约翰，因此我走到他的椅子前。他用了三分钟朝我猛伸舌头，舌根差点没断了。我知道他马上就要下手，一面担心挨打，一面凝视着这个就要动手的人那张丑恶的、令人生厌的脸。我不知他是否看出了我的心思；因为，突然间，他二话不说，下了狠手。我踉跄了一下，从他椅子跟前往后退了一两步，才又站稳。</td>
		<td class="en">Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it.I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁让你刚才跟妈妈顶嘴，这是给你的教训。”他说，“谁让你偷偷摸摸地躲在窗帘后面，谁让你两分钟前用那种眼神看我，你这只耗子！”</td>
		<td class="en">“That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,” said he,“and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我已经习惯了约翰·里德的辱骂，从来都不愿回应。我在意的是怎样忍受辱骂过后必然随之而来的一顿暴打。</td>
		<td class="en">Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在窗帘后面干什么？” 他问。</td>
		<td class="en">“What were you doing behind the curtain?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我在看书。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I was reading.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把书拿出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Show the book.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我走回窗边把书取来。</td>
		<td class="en">I returned to the window and fetched it thence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你没权利拿我们的书，妈妈说你是个累赘，你没有钱，你爸爸什么都没留给你。你应该去乞讨，而不是跟像我们这样体面人家的孩子一起住在这儿，你不该跟我们吃同样的饭，穿妈妈花钱买的衣服。现在，你乱翻我的书架，我要教训你。这些书都是我的，整个房子都属于我，或者过几年就都是我的了。去站到门边，离镜子和窗户远点儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama’s expense.Now, I’ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they ARE mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years.Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我照他说的做了，起初还不知道他的意图，但当我看到他举起书并拿稳，站起身做好了要扔的姿势时，我一声尖叫，本能地往旁边一闪。但是太晚了，书已经扔了过来，正好打到我。我摔倒了，头撞在门上，磕伤了。伤口磕出了血，疼痛难忍。我的恐惧已经超过了极限，其他情感占了上风。</td>
		<td class="en">“I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it.The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你这个邪恶残忍的孩子！” 我说，“你就像个谋杀犯——像个奴隶监工——像个罗马的暴君！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said. “You are like a murderer—you are like a slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我读过戈德史密斯的《罗马史》，对尼禄、卡利古拉等人已经形成了自己的看法。我曾私下做过对比，但从没想过会这么大声地喊出来。</td>
		<td class="en">I had read Goldsmith’s @History of Rome@, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, &c.Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么！什么！” 他喊道，“那是她对我说的吗？你们听到了吗，伊莱扎、乔治亚娜？我能不去告诉妈妈吗？但是首先——”</td>
		<td class="en">“What! what!” he cried .“Did she say that to me? Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mama? but first—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他径直朝我跑过来，我感到他抓住了我的头发和肩膀，他已经不顾一切了。我发现他真的是个暴君，是个谋杀犯。我感觉到一两滴血从头上流到脖子里，感觉到一阵剧烈的疼痛。这些感觉一时占了上风，我不再害怕，疯狂地和他打了起来。我不太清楚我的双手都干了什么，只听他喊我“耗子！耗子！”，并大声咆哮。他的救兵马上就要到了，伊莱扎和乔治亚娜已经跑去找里德夫人了。里德夫人上楼来到现场，后面跟着贝西和女仆阿博特。我们被拉开，我听到有人说——“哎呀！哎呀！怎么在约翰少爷身上出这么大的气！”“有谁见过发这么大脾气的！”</td>
		<td class="en">He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing.I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me“Rat! Rat!” and bellowed out aloud.Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot.We were parted: I heard the words—“Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!” “Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >紧接着，里德夫人补充道：“把她带到红房子里，锁起来。”有四只手马上按住我，把我带上了楼。</td>

		<td class="en">CHAPTER II</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我一路上都在反抗，对我来说，这还是第一次，因此大大加深了贝西和阿博特小姐对我的厌恶。事实上，我有点失控，或者就像法国人说的，变得不再是自己了。我知道，一时的反抗让我不得不遭受离奇古怪的惩罚。于是，和其他反叛的奴隶一样，我已经下定决心，不顾一切地拼命反抗。</td>
		<td class="en">I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me.The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather OUT of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“抓住她的胳膊，阿博特小姐，她就像一只发疯的猫。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，她们已经把我关进里德太太指定的房间，推搡到一条凳子上，我则冲动地像弹簧一样跳起来，但又立刻被两双手按住了。</td>
		<td class="en">They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“记住别动了。”贝西说。然后当她确定我真的平息了，便松开我。接着，她和阿博特小姐抱着手站着，怀疑地望着我，脸色阴沉，仿佛不相信我是神志清醒的。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她以前从没这样过。”贝西最后转过去对那个女仆说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“She never did so before,” at last said Bessie, turning to the abigail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过她天性如此。”后者回答道，“我经常和太太谈起我对这孩子的看法，太太也同意。她是个阴险的小东西，我从没见过她这个年纪的女孩子这么有心计。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But it was always in her,” was the reply.“I’ve told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.She’s an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.”</td></tr>

That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne?In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">November, December, and half of January passed away.Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted;and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing room door opened and closed.When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stair head to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable.To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally bearing the candle along with her.I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow.It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation.I could not sleep unless it was folded in my nightgown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >等待人群离开的时间似乎很长，我还想听到楼梯上贝西的脚步声。她有时趁着间隙上来找顶针或剪刀，或是可能带点儿东西给我当晚饭——一块小圆面包或是一块乳酪蛋糕——然后她会坐在床边看着我吃。我吃完后，她会为我掖下衣服，亲我两下说：“晚安，简小姐。”在她这么温柔的时候，贝西在我眼中就是世上最优秀、最漂亮、最善良的人，我强烈地渴望她能永远这么和蔼可亲，永远不会像她往常那样无故推我、骂我，或是差遣我。我想贝西·李的确是个天生能干的姑娘，因为她每件事都做得很漂亮，还很有讲故事的天份，至少从她那些在育儿室讲的故事给我的印象中，我相信她是这样的。如果我对她的脸蛋和身材记得没错的话，她也很漂亮。我记得她身材修长，一头乌发，黑眼睛，非常精致的五官，肤色很好，但她脾气暴躁善变，没有原则和公道。尽管如此，在盖茨黑德府，她仍是我最喜欢的人。</td>
		<td class="en">Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a cheesecake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me, and said, “Good night, Miss Jane.”When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do.Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales.She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and person are correct.I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.</td></tr>

Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said, “Will you go in and bid Missis good-bye?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly up the room.I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front;on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue;her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her girdle.Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer book intrusted to me to carry to church.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school.The order was now given “To the garden!”Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.I was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner.When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay.I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday.The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我大部分时间都在房里走来走去。我猜想自己只是为了损失而遗憾，考虑着怎样来弥补，但当思绪结束时，我一抬头，发现整个下午都过去了，暮色渐深。我有了另一个发现，那就是，在这期间我经历了一个转变过程。我的思想已经摆脱了所有从坦普尔小姐那里借来的东西——或者说，她已带走了我在她身边呼吸的那种宁静气息——现在，我恢复了天性，开始感受到往日的情绪在蠢蠢欲动。看起来不像是支柱被抽去，而更像是是没了动力；不是我无力保持平静，只是保持平静的原因不再存在。这些年来，洛伍德便是我的世界，它的规则和体系就是我的经历。而现在，我记起真实世界是广阔的，是个变幻莫测的领域，有着希望和恐惧、感动和兴奋。等待着那些有勇气的人，跨入它的广阔天地，在危险中探寻生命的真谛。</td>
		<td class="en">I walked about the chamber most of the time.I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process;that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more.My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我走到窗前，打开窗向外望去。只见大楼的两个侧翼，种植园，洛伍德的边界，还有山峦起伏的地平线。我的视线掠过所有其他物体，落在远处蔚蓝的山尖上，那正是我渴望战胜的地方。界限以内的岩石和荒野看起来就像监狱和流放地。我追随着那条环绕山脚的白色道路，看它消失在两山间的峡谷中，我多想沿着它走更远啊！我想起自己曾经坐着马车穿过那条路，我仍记得在暮色中下山的情景。自从我第一次来到洛伍德，好像一个世纪一晃而过，从此我不曾离开。我的假期全部在学校度过，里德夫人从没叫人接我回盖茨黑德府，她或她的家人也从未看望过我。我没有用书信或消息与外面的世界联系过。学校的规则、任务、习惯、观念、声音、脸庞、警句、穿着，以及偏好和厌恶——这就是我所知道的生活。现在我觉得这还不够，一个下午过后，我厌倦了八年来循规蹈矩的生活。我渴望自由，热切地渴望，我为自由祈祷，但它似乎飘散在风中，被轻轻吹走。我放弃了这个念头，构造出一个更加谦卑的请求，为了改变，为了刺激，而这个请求好像也被吹向茫茫宇宙。“那么，”我近乎绝望地喊道，“至少给我一种新的苦役吧！”</td>

		<td class="en">The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached.I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give.As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie’s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a “Gytrash,” which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">These pictures were in water-colours.The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land.One gleam of light lifted into relief a half submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon.Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it.Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible.Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.This pale crescent was “the likeness of a kingly crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which shape had none.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him.When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense easy chair at the fireside.“And mind,” he continued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.I sit in the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly lit apartment; the window curtain half hides me.Again the arch yawns; they come.The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young.Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentlemanlike: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a “pere noble de theatre.”Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary’s apathetic and listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来，他终于来了。我并没有看向拱门，但我知道他进来了。我努力把精力集中于针孔，我正编织的网眼钱包——我希望心里想的只有手里的活计，放在腿上的珠子和银线。然而，我清楚地看到了他，自然而然地回忆起我上次见到他时的情景。就在我给了他，他所谓的重要帮助后，他握着我的手，低头看着我的脸，注视着我，眼中流露出满得要溢出的深情，我当时也沉浸在这种感情里。那一刻，我离他有多近呀！但之后又发生了什么，让他和我的相对位置发生了变化？而现在，我们之间又是多么生疏，多么冷淡！这种遥远的距离感使我不期望他走过来与我交谈。我并不奇怪，他看都没看我一眼，就在房间的另一边坐下，开始与一些女士们谈话。“带阿德拉去上床，过了她睡觉的时间了。”我一看到他全身心地聊着，知道可以不引起注意地注视他，我的目光就本能地落到他的脸上。我无法控制，眼皮抬起，眼珠就定格在了他的身上。我看着他，从中体会到了敏锐的快感——一种珍贵而尖刻的快感，如纯金一般，又有着尖刻的痛苦，这种快感就像一个行将渴死的人，虽然他明知自己爬向的是下了毒的泉水，但还是会义无反顾地俯身畅饮这神圣之水。</td>
		<td class="en">He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.I try to concentrate my attention on those netting needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it;just after I had rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.How near had I approached him at that moment!What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my relative positions?Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.“To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime.”No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise, and the irids would fix on him.I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“情人眼里出西施”，的确如此。主人那苍白的、橄榄色的脸，又大又方的额头，宽阔浓黑的眉毛，深沉的眼睛，凸显的五官，坚挺冷酷的嘴——充满了能量、果断、意志——按一般的标准，他的面貌并不帅气；但在我看来，他已经超越了帅气，成了一种可以将我控制的兴趣和影响力——使我无力掌控自己的感情，而是为他的力量所羁绊。我不想爱上他，读者都知道我已经努力将对他的爱之萌芽驱逐出我的灵魂，但现在，当我再见他时的第一眼，那些嫩芽便自动出现，又绿又茁壮！他无须看我一眼，就使我爱上了他。</td>
		<td class="en">Most true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.”My master’s colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision, will,—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me,—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his.I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong!He made me love him without looking at me.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I compared him with his guests.What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,—even the military distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh featured and melancholy looking.I saw them smile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh.I saw Mr. Rochester smile:—his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton.I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved.“He is not to them what he is to me,” I thought: “he is not of their kind.I believe he is of mine;—I am sure he is—I feel akin to him—I understand the language of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster?Blasphemy against nature!Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me.For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:—and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.Its second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.The drawing room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room, appeared a large marble basin—which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗切斯特先生坐在这个盆旁边的地毯上，披着披肩，头上缠着头巾。他深色的眼睛、黝黑的皮肤和异教徒的长相与这身装束颇为相配，看起来很像一位东方世界的酋长，一个执行绞刑者或遭受绞刑者。这时，英格拉姆小姐走上前。她也一副东方人士扮相,一个深红色的围巾缠在腰间当作腰带；刺绣的手绢在太阳穴处打了一个结；她优美的手臂裸露着，一只手优雅地高举过头顶，做托水罐状。她刻画的体型容貌、肤色神态都给人以宗法社会时期某位以色列公主的暗示，这无疑正是她要代表的人物。</td>
		<td class="en">Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.His dark eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.Both her cast of form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know.I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away.Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead.Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful working.I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large.“Good! but not quite the thing,” I thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;” and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success.There, I had a friend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me?I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness.Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty.From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet.The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost.I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion.Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment—not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me.I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一切都办妥的时候已经快到圣诞节了，全国上下休假的日子就要到来了。我已经把莫顿学校关了，并且特别注意不让学生从我这里空手而别。好的财运不但使人心情畅快，而且出手也大方了。把我们得到很多的东西分一些给他人，就是为自己沸腾的情感提供一个宣泄的机会。我早已感觉到许多乡村学生喜欢我，我很高兴，而我们分别的时刻证明了我的感觉是对的。她们对我的感情表现得朴实而强烈。令我深感满意的是，我发现在他们那质朴无邪的心中真有我的一席之地。于是我许诺每个星期都会去看望她们，并且会在学校里给她们上一小时课。</td>
		<td class="en">It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached.I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side.Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations.I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour’s teaching in their school.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >里弗斯先生走过来，看到班级里的六十个女孩子从我面前鱼贯而出。我锁上了教室的门，站在那儿，手里拿着钥匙，正在和六七个最优秀的学生说几句特别的临别之言。这几个女孩子举止得体、值得敬重、谦逊有礼、博学广识，是英国农民阶层中的佼佼者。这已经算是了不起了，因为毕竟英国的农民阶层是欧洲所有的农民中最有教养、最讲礼节、最懂自尊的。从那之后，我见过法国与德国的农妇，在我看来，她们中最好的与我们莫顿的女孩们相比，也显得无知、粗俗和愚笨。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你觉得自己这段时间的努力得到回报了吗？”学生们走后，里弗斯先生问道，“意识到自己在青春时代做了些真正的好事难道不令人感到愉快吗？”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，”我说，“但是我不能一直这样做下去。我愿意培养他人的才能，也渴望发挥自己的才能。而现在我必须发挥自己的才能，别想让我的身心再回到学校上了，我已经摆脱它了，我想好好度个假。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” I said; “but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.I must enjoy them now; don’t recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他接过钥匙。“你兴高采烈地辞去了工作。”他说，“我不太明白你这种轻松愉快的心情，因为我不知道你辞掉这份工作后，又会为自己找什么样的工作。现在你生活的目标、意向和抱负是什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">He took it.“You give it up very gleefully,” said he; “I don’t quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing.What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的首要目标就是‘清扫’（你理解这个词的全部含义吗？）——把荒原小屋从房间到地下室全部清扫干净；其次就是用黄蜡、油和数不清的抹布把房子擦得锃亮；再次，就是以数学的精确度把所有的桌椅、床和地毯摆放妥当；然后我要差不多用尽你的煤和泥炭，给每间屋子都烧好火；最后呢，在你的妹妹们预计要回来之前的那两天，我和汉娜要忙活着拌鸡蛋、拣葡萄干、磨香料、做圣诞饼、剁做肉馅饼用的食材，还要郑重其事地完成其他烹饪仪式。对你这种门外汉，语言是不能充分说清楚我们要做的活儿的。总的来说，我的目的就是在下周四黛安娜和玛丽回来之前，把所有的东西都准备就绪，万无一失；我的雄心就是在她们到来时给她们一个最理想的欢迎。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My first aim will be to CLEAN DOWN (do you comprehend the full force of the expression?)—to CLEAN DOWN Moor House from chamber to cellar; my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision;afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room;and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months’ grace I allow you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with this late-found charm of relationship; but THEN, I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我吃惊地看着他。“圣约翰，”我说，“我觉得你这么说简直是不怀好意。我想要像个女王那样心满意足，而你却想方设法令我心神不宁！你有什么目的？”</td>

		<td class="en">“To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account.Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of that.And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.Don’t cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.Do you hear, Jane?”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在荒原小屋忙得不亦乐乎，汉娜也是如此。她看到我在乱七八糟的房子里忙忙得乐不可支——我是怎样刷洗、除尘、清理，还有烹调，她简直为我着了迷。然而事实上，在一两天最混乱的日子过后，我们逐渐从自己制造的狼藉中理出了头绪，这令人感到高兴。我之前去了一趟S城，购买了一些新家具。我的表哥表姐们全权委托我，让我随自己的意愿对房子进行改动，还拿出了一笔钱专为此用。我大体保持了那普通的起居室和卧室的原貌。因为我知道黛安娜和玛丽再次看到原来那些亲切的桌椅和床铺，会比看到最时髦、新颖的家具更快乐。然而也有必要增加一些新意，好使得她们回来时可以体会到一种我希望可以实现的新鲜感。漂亮的深色新地毯和新窗帘、精心挑选的瓷器和铜器古董摆设、新罩子和梳状台上的镜子和化妆盒，这些都能派上用场：看上去既新鲜又不显得扎眼。还有一间空出来的客厅和卧室，我用旧红木家具和深红色的帷帘重新装饰了一下。在走廊里铺了粗帆布，楼梯上铺了地毯。所有的工作都完成以后，我觉得在冬季这么凄凉、沉寂的外部环境中，荒原小屋的室内完全是亮丽、质朴而温馨的典范。</td>
		<td class="en">Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.I had previously taken a journey to S—to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me CARTE BLANCHE TO effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations.Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring.A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the stairs.When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >意义非凡的星期四终于到来了。她们预计会在天黑时回来，黄昏之前楼上楼下的炉火都生了起来，厨房非常整洁，我和汉娜都穿戴整齐，一切都准备就绪。</td>
		<td class="en">The eventful Thursday at length came.They were expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >圣约翰先到了。我之前已经恳请他在一切都安置好之前不要过来；而且，说真的，光想象一下屋里面一度又脏又乱，一片狼藉的样子，足以吓得他不敢走近了。他在厨房找到我，我正在照管要烘烤的茶点蛋糕。他走近壁炉，问我是不是终于对自己这种女佣的工作感到满意了。作为回答，我邀请他陪我整体视察一下我的劳动成果。我好不容易才让他转遍了整座房子。他仅仅从我打开的房门往里瞧瞧。楼上楼下都溜达了一圈之后，他说我在这么短的时间内就对房子做了这么大的改动，肯定受了不少劳累和麻烦。但他没有用任何言语对自己房间的改变表示出一丝的喜悦。</td>
		<td class="en">St. John arrived first.I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement.He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.Approaching the hearth, he asked, “If I was at last satisfied with housemaid’s work?”I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours.With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the house.He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种沉默真让我扫兴。我以为可能这些改变搅乱了他所珍惜的对于某些往事的联想。我问他是不是这个原因，当然语气有些灰心丧气。</td>
		<td class="en">This silence damped me.I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some old associations he valued.I inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一点也没有。”他说，“正相反，你已经非常小心地考虑到了每一处与过去有关的联想，说实话，恐怕你在这方面花的心思远远超出了它本身的重要性。比如，为了布置这间屋子，你花了多少时间思考啊？顺便问一下，你知道某本书放在哪儿了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth.How many minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?—By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我指给他书架上的那本书，他取了下来，退到他待惯了的窗户凹陷处，开始读起书来。</td>
		<td class="en">I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，读者朋友，我不喜欢他这样。圣约翰是个好人，但是我开始觉得他说自己冷漠无情的时候，说的是实话。生活中的仁爱和舒适对他一点吸引力都没有，生活安宁的享受对他而言没有任何魅力。实际上，他活着只是为了渴求——渴求的当然是优秀、伟大的东西，但是他永远不会安顿下来，也不赞成身边的人满足于安逸。我看着他那高高的额头，像白色的石头一样宁静、苍白，还有他认真读书时英俊的面孔——一时间我明白了他很难成为一个好丈夫，做他的妻子会是件折磨人的事。出于灵感，我仿佛突然明白了他对奥利弗小姐的爱慕之情是什么性质。我同意他的观点，那确实只是一种感官的爱。我理解了他为何会因为自己受到这种狂热的爱慕之情的影响而鄙视自己，为何他希望遏制并摧毁这种感情，为何他不相信这种爱会使他或她得到长久的幸福。我觉得他就是可以被大自然打造成英雄的材料——基督徒或异教徒——立法者、政治家、征服者，是一座可以委以重任的坚固壁垒；但是在家中，他却常常像一根冰冷、笨重的柱子，忧郁沉闷，与周围的环境不协调。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, I did not like this, reader.St. John was a good man; but I began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him—its peaceful enjoyments no charm.Literally, he lived only to aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting round him.As I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife.I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses.I comprehended how he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.I saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian and Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这间客厅不是他的天地，”我想，“喜马拉雅山脉或是南非丛林，甚至瘟疫肆虐的几内亚海岸的沼泽地可能会更适合他。他完全可以逃离安宁的家庭生活，这不适合他。在这种生活中他的才能会停滞不前，它们得不到发展，也发挥不出作用。只有在斗争和危险的环境中，在勇气得到证明、能力得到锻炼、毅力受到考验的地方，他才会说话，才会行动，成为领导者和优胜者。在家里，一个快乐的孩子都要胜他一筹。他选择做一名传教士是正确的——我现在明白了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him better.Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to advantage.It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak and move, the leader and superior.A merry child would have the advantage of him on this hearth.He is right to choose a missionary’s career—I see it now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她们回来了！她们回来了！”汉娜喊道，并一下推开了客厅的门。这时，老卡洛也快乐地叫了起来。我跑了出去。天已经黑了，但可以听到隆隆的车轮声。汉娜很快点燃了一盏提灯。马车在花园小门口停下，车夫打开了车门。先是一个熟悉的身影走下了车，接着是另一个。刹那间，我就把脸扎进她俩的帽子下边了，我先碰碰玛丽柔软的脸颊，再摸摸黛安娜飘逸的卷发。她们笑着吻了吻我，又吻了吻汉娜，拍了拍由于高兴而近乎发狂的老卡洛。她们急切地询问是否一切都好，肯定的答复使她们放了心，这才匆忙地进了屋。</td>
		<td class="en">“They are coming! they are coming!” cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour door.At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.Out I ran.It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.Hannah soon had a lantern lit.The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary’s soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls.They laughed—kissed me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened into the house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从惠特克劳斯到这里的长途颠簸使她们浑身僵硬，晚上的寒气也把她们冻坏了；但是一看到振奋人心的火光，她们亲切的面容便舒展了开来。当车夫和汉娜把箱子搬进来时，她们问起了圣约翰。这时，他从客厅里走了过来。她们俩立刻搂住了他的脖子。他默不作声地各吻了她们一下，低声说了几句欢迎的话，站了一会儿，让她们同他说话，然后说了句估计她们很快就会在客厅和他会面，就逃难似的退回了客厅。</td>
		<td class="en">They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight.While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, they demanded St. John.At this moment he advanced from the parlour.They both threw their arms round his neck at once.He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我为她俩点燃了蜡烛好让她们上楼，可黛安娜得先去嘱咐车夫几句好客的话。完事之后，两人跟着我上了楼。她们很高兴地看到自己房间里的新家具和装饰品：新窗帘、新地毯，还有色彩丰富的瓷花瓶。她们由衷地表达了她们的感激之情。我很高兴我的布置正称她们的心意，我所做的工作为她们愉快的回家之旅增添了生动的魅力。</td>
		<td class="en">I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那晚真是轻松愉快。我的表姐们兴高采烈，她们滔滔不绝地叙述着、议论着，她们的畅谈淹没了圣约翰的沉默。见到妹妹们，他的确很高兴，但是她们洋溢的热情和流动的喜悦却引不起他的共鸣。那天的大事就是黛安娜和玛丽的归来，这令他高兴。但是随之而来的欢乐的喧闹和喋喋不休、热情的接待使他厌烦。我看得出他希望平静的翌日早些到来。喝完茶后大约一小时，我们晚上的欢乐达到了极点，这时却听到一阵敲门声。汉娜走进来说：“来了一个可怜的小伙儿，在这么个不合适的时候请里弗斯先生去看看他的母亲，她快不行了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Sweet was that evening.My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John’s taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.The event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.In the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door.Hannah entered with the intimation that “a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I’m sure, sir, you had better not.It’s the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there’s no track at all over the bog.And then it is such a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt.You had better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但他已经在走廊里披他的斗篷了，然后，没有反对也没有抱怨，他出发了。那时已经九点了。他直到半夜才回来。尽管他又饿又累，但是看起来比出发的时候要高兴多了。他完成了一项职责，付出了一份努力。他感到自己有克己奉献的力量，自我感觉好多了。</td>
		<td class="en">But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he departed.It was then nine o’clock: he did not return till midnight.Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when he set out.He had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms with himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >恐怕接下来的一整周他的耐心都会受到考验。那是圣诞周，我们没什么正经的工作要做，只是在家里嬉闹、消遣。荒原的空气、居家的自由、生活富足的曙光就像使人返老还童的灵丹妙药，作用于黛安娜和玛丽的心灵。她们从早上到中午，从中午到晚上都兴致勃勃的。她们可以不停地谈天说地，她们的话语诙谐、精辟、原汁原味，令我非常着迷。我喜欢聆听她们交谈，并且参与其中，而不愿去做任何其他的事情。圣约翰没有对我们的快活加以指责，但是也不参与其中。他很少在家，他管辖的教区很大，人口分散，他把到不同的地方探望穷困的病人作为每天的例行公事。</td>
		<td class="en">I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation.The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night.They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么罗莎蒙德·奥利弗呢？”玛丽问。这句话仿佛是脱口而出的，因为她刚说完就立刻做了个手势，仿佛想要收回去似的。圣约翰手中拿着一本书——吃饭时读书是他不合群的习惯——他合上书，抬起头来。</td>
		<td class="en">“And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them.St. John had a book in his hand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and looked up,</td></tr>

		<td class="en">You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at the school where he had placed her.Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much.She looked pale and thin: she said she was not happy.I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with me.I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another—my husband needed them all.So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes.I took care she should never want for anything that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.As she grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.By her grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我如今已经结婚十年了。我懂得了全心全意跟自己最爱的人一起活着，为他而活着是多么幸福的事。我自认为太有福气了，这种福气不是言语可以表达的，因为就如同我丈夫完全是我的生命一样，我也完全是他的生命。再没有第二个女人能比我更贴近自己的爱人了，比我更完全地成为他的骨中之骨，肉中之肉了。与我的爱德华相守，我永远不会厌倦，他同我相守也是一样，就像我们不会厌倦各自胸膛里心脏的搏动一样。所以，我们永远相守。对我们来说，相守像独处时一样自由，又像相聚时一样快乐。我感觉我们整天都在交谈，相互交谈不过是另一种更活跃的、有声的思考。我对他无话不说，他对我推心置腹；我们性格完全相投，因此达到了完美的统一。</td>
		<td class="en">I have now been married ten years.I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth.I hold myself supremely blest—blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband’s life as fully is he is mine.No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.I know no weariness of my Edward’s society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking.All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character—perfect concord is the result.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们婚后前两年，罗切斯特先生仍然失明，也许正是这个情况使我们两个得以如此贴近彼此，让我们紧密地交织在一起。因为那时我就是他的眼睛，正如我现在还是他的右手一样。我的确是他的眼珠（他常常这么称呼我）。他通过我看大自然，看书。我永不厌倦地替他观察，然后用语言向他描述田野、树木、城镇、河流、云朵、阳光，我们面前的一切景色，还有周围的天气——用声音使他的耳朵感受眼睛无法通过光线感受到的景象。我还不知厌倦地读书给他听，领他去想去的地方，总之就是做所有他想做的事情。为他服务我感到快乐，虽然有些悲伤，但却充实而微妙——因为他要我帮忙时并不痛苦地感到羞愧，或是沮丧地感到屈辱。他爱我至真至纯，欣然地接受我的照顾，他感觉得到我爱他如此之深，接受我的照顾就是满足我最甜蜜的愿望。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.He saw nature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round us—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye.Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to be done.And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad—because he claimed these services without painful shame or damping humiliation.He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我和他去了趟伦敦。他听从了一位有名的眼科医生的建议，最终恢复了那只眼睛的视力。现在他虽不能看得特别清楚，不能过多地看书或写字，但走路不用再牵着别人的手了。对他来说，天空不再是一片空白，大地也不再是一种空虚。当他的第一个孩子放进他怀里时，他可以看见那孩子继承了他从前的那双眼睛——又大，又亮，又黑。在那一刻，他又一次全心地感激上帝赐予了他怜悯，减轻了惩罚。</td>
		<td class="en">He and I went up to London.He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him—the earth no longer a void.When his firstborn was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once were—large, brilliant, and black.On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.</td></tr>
