		<td class="en">He came to lying on his back with sunlight pouring down into his face and the murmur of running water close by. There was a brilliant ache in his optic nerve, and a steady, painless throbbing at the base of his skull—the distant thunder of an approaching migraine. He rolled onto his side and pushed up into a sitting position, tucking his head between his knees. Sensed the instability of the world long before he opened his eyes, like its axis had been cut loose to teeter. His first deep breath felt like someone driving a steel wedge between the ribs high on his left side, but he groaned through the pain and forced his eyes to open. His left eye must have been badly swollen, because it seemed like he was staring through a slit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The greenest grass he'd ever seen—a forest of long, soft blades—ran down to the bank. The water was clear and swift as it flowed between the boulders that jutted out of the channel. Across the river, a cliff swept up for a thousand feet. Pines grew in clusters along the ledges, and the air was filled with the smell of them and the sweetness of the moving water.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He was dressed in black pants and a black jacket with an Oxford shirt underneath, the white cotton speckled with blood. A black tie hung by the flimsiest knot from his collar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">On his first attempt to get up, his knees buckled and he sat down hard enough to send a vibration of searing pain through his rib cage. His second try succeeded, and he found himself wobbly but standing, the ground a pitching deck beneath his feet. He turned slowly, his feet shuffling and spread wide for balance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">With the river behind him, he stood at the edge of an open field. On the far side, the metal surfaces of swing sets and sliding boards glimmered under an intense, midday sun.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Not another soul around.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Beyond the park, he glimpsed Victorian houses, and farther on, the buildings of a main street. The town was at most a mile across, and it sat in the middle of an amphitheater of stone, enclosed by cliff walls rising several thousand feet on every side and composed of red-banded rock. In the highest, shadowed mountain nooks, pockets of snow lingered, but down here in the valley, it was warm, the sky above a deep and cloudless cobalt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">That he was thirty-seven years old.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And that he needed to get to a hospital.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Outside those facts, the world and his place in it wasn't so much hidden as printed in a foreign nomenclature beyond his comprehension. He could sense the truth hovering on the outskirts of consciousness, but it lay just out of reach.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He walked up a quiet, residential street, studying every car he passed. Did one of them belong to him?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The houses that faced each other were pristine—freshly painted with perfect little squares of bright grass framed by picket fences and each household name stenciled in white block letters on the side of a black mailbox.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">In almost every backyard, he saw a vibrant garden, bursting not only with flowers but vegetables and fruit.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">All the colors so pure and vivid.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Midway through the second block, he winced. The exertion of walking had drawn a deep breath out of him, the pain in his left side stopping him in his tracks. Removing his jacket, he pulled his Oxford out of his waistline, unbuttoned the shirt, and opened it. Looked even worse than it felt—all down his left side stretched a dark purple bruise, bulls-eyed with a swath of jaundiced yellow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Something had hit him. Hard.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He ran his hand lightly over the surface of his skull. The headache was there, becoming more pronounced by the minute, but he didn't feel any signs of severe trauma beyond tenderness on the left side.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He buttoned his shirt back, tucked it into his pants, and continued up the street.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The blaring conclusion was that he'd been involved in some sort of accident.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Maybe a car. Maybe a fall. Maybe he'd been attacked—that could explain why he carried no wallet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He should go to the police first thing. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Unless...</td></tr>

		<td class="en">What if he'd done something wrong? Committed a crime?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Was that possible?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Maybe he should wait, see if anything came back to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Though nothing about this town struck him as remotely familiar, he realized, as he stumbled up the street, that he was reading the name on every mailbox. A subconscious thing? Because down in the recesses of memory he knew that one of these mailboxes would have his name printed across the side? And that seeing it would bring everything back?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The buildings of downtown lifted above the pines several blocks ahead, and he could hear, for the first time, the noise of cars in motion, distant voices, the hum of ventilation systems.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He froze in the middle of the street, involuntarily cocking his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He was staring at a mailbox that belonged to a red and green two-story Victorian.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Staring at the name on the side of it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">No.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The way the word rolled off his tongue, it wasn't natural. Didn't feel like anything that belonged to him. If he was honest, he hated the word, because it conjured up...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Fear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">How strange. For some reason, the word instilled fear.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He walked on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Three more blocks brought him to the corner of Main and 6th Street, where he sat down on a shaded bench and took a slow, careful breath. He looked up and down the street, eyes desperate for anything familiar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Not a chain store in sight.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">**WAYWARD PINES HOTEL**</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The smell of coffee beans pulled him off the bench. He looked up, saw a place called The Steaming Bean halfway up the block that had to be the source.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Hmm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Wasn't necessarily the most useful piece of knowledge, all things considered, but it dawned on him that he loved good coffee. Craved it. Another tiny piece of the puzzle that constituted his identity. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He walked to the coffee shop and pulled open the screened door. The shop was small and quaint, and just by the smell of things, he could tell they brewed great product. A bar down the right side faced espresso machines, grinders, blenders, bottles of flavor shots. Three stools were occupied. A few sofas and chairs lined the opposite wall. A bookshelf of faded paperbacks. Two old timers were at war on a chessboard with mismatched pieces. The walls displayed local artwork—a series of black-and-white self-portraits of some middle-aged woman whose expression never changed from photo to photo. Only the focus of the camera changed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He approached the cash register.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Does she know me?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">In a mirror behind the register he caught his reflection and immediately understood what had prompted her look of disgust—the left side of his face was blanketed in a massive bruise, and his left eye bulged, nearly swollen shut.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">My God. Someone beat the shit out of me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">Aside from his hideous bruise, he wasn't bad-looking. Figured he stood six feet tall, maybe six-one. Short black hair, and a two-day beard coming in like a shadow across the lower half of his face. A solid, muscular build evident in the way his jacket hung on his shoulders and the taut stretch of the Oxford across his chest. He thought he looked like some advertising or marketing exec—probably cut a damn striking profile when he was shaved and polished up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">"What can I get for you?" the barista asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>

		<td class="en">The reemergence into sunlight made his balance falter and cranked his budding headache up a few degrees into the lower range of excruciating. There was no traffic, so he jaywalked to the other side of Main and headed up the block toward 5th Street, passing a young mother and her little boy who whispered something that sounded like, "Mommy, is that him?" </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The woman hushed her son and caught the man's eye with an apologetic frown, said, "I'm sorry about that, he didn't mean to be rude."</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He arrived at the corner of 5th and Main in front of a two-story brownstone with FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF WAYWARD PINES stenciled across the glass double-doors. Around the side of the building, he spotted a phone booth standing near the alleyway.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He limped toward it as fast as he could and closed himself inside the booth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">The phonebook was the slimmest he'd ever seen, and he stood there thumbing through it, hoping for some revelatory breakthrough, but it was just eight pages of several hundred names that, like everything else in this town, held no meaning for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He dropped the phonebook, let it dangle from its metal cord, his forehead resting against the cool glass.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en">He'd call collect, hope to God someone was home—assuming he had a someone. Of course, he wouldn't have a name to give them, not a real one at least, but maybe they'd recognize his voice and accept the call.</td></tr>

Cocked his right arm back fully intending to put his fist through the glass, knuckles be damned, but the pain in his busted ribs blazed through everything and doubled him over onto the floor of the phone booth.</td></tr>
