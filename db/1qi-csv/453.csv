"作者：弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫","by Virginia Woolf "
"达洛维夫人说她要亲自去买些花。","Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself."
"因为露西已有一份合适的工作要做。要把门从铰链上卸下来；昂伯尔梅尔公司的人就要到了。然后，克拉丽莎·达洛维思忖，多惬意的早晨啊——空气清新得仿佛是特意送给海滩上的孩子们似的。","For Lucy had her work cut out for her.The doors would be taken off their hinges; umpelmayer’s men were coming.And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning—fresh as if issued to children on a beach."
"多么动听的百灵！多么迅疾的举动！对她来说过去似乎总是这样，随着合叶轻微的吱吱声，这声音她现在也能听到，她会突然打开落地窗，扎到伯顿的户外。那里清晨的空气多清新、多宁静，自然比眼前的更静谧，宛如浪涛拍打，又像浪花亲吻，冰冷刺骨却又（对当时她这样芳龄十八的姑娘来说）显得肃穆，那时她对着敞开的窗伫立着，预感到某种可怕的事即将发生。她赏着花，凝视着雾霭缭绕的树丛和飞起飞落的白嘴鸭，这样站着凝视着直到听见彼得·沃尔什说：“在蔬菜中冥想吗？”——说了那样的话吗？“我喜欢人胜过花椰菜”——说了那样的话吗？他——彼得·沃尔什一定在一天早晨吃早餐时说了那样的话，那时她已走到外面的阳台了。近日他会从印度归来，是六月还是七月，她忘了，因为他写的信异常乏味。他的话她倒记得。他的双眼、他的折叠刀、他的微笑、他的暴躁，千百万件往事都已如烟消散——真怪！几句如此有关卷心菜的话却浮现出来。","What a lark!What a plunge!For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air.How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said, “Musing among the vegetables?”—was that it?—“I prefer men to cauliflowers”—was that it?He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace—Peter Walsh.He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished—how strange it was!—a few sayings like this about cabbages."
"她站在马路边上的一个大石头旁，稍微挺了挺身子，等达特奈尔公司的运货车开过。真是个迷人的女人，斯克罗普·珀维斯这样认为（他熟悉她就如你了解住在威斯敏斯特区隔壁的人那样）。她有一点鸟的特性，犹如松鸦，青绿、轻快、活泼，尽管她已五十有余，并且患病以来愈显苍白。她倚在马路边上，压根儿没看到他，直立着身子，等着过街。","She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall’s van to pass.A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright."
"在威斯敏斯特区住了——到如今多少年？有二十几年吧——克拉丽莎可以肯定，即使置身于川流不息的大街，亦或夜晚梦醒，你都会觉察出一种特有的静谧，或是肃穆；一种难以名状的停滞；大本钟敲响之前的心神不宁（不过他们说，那或许是由于她的心脏受了流感的影响）。听啊！钟声隆隆地响起来了。开始是预报，悦耳动听；接着是报时，精确无误。如铅般沉重的音波在空气中渐渐消逝。她一边穿过维多利亚大街，一边思忖，我们真是大笨蛋。因为只有天晓得为何人如此热爱生活，怎样看待生活，为之精心构思，围绕自己来构建生活，又将其推翻，每时每刻都在刷新重建；但是即便衣着过时之极的老顽固，坐在门阶上异常懊丧苦恼之辈（酗酒致使他们潦倒）也这般看待生活；她毫不怀疑，正是由于那个原因，即使是议会法案也无可奈何：人们就是热爱生活。在人们眼里，在轻盈的、沉重的、艰难的步履中，在吼叫和喧嚣里，在四轮马车、汽车、公共汽车、有蓬货车、胸前身后都挂有广告牌的脚步沉重、摇摇摆摆的广告员中，铜管乐队，手摇风琴，在庆功的欢呼声和铃儿的叮当声以及头顶上空飞机奇怪的高歌声中，有她热爱的事物。生活、伦敦、这六月的时刻。","For having lived in Westminster—how many years now?over twenty,—one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes.There! Out it boomed.First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable.The leaden circles dissolved in the air.Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street.For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can’t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life.In people’s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June."
"因为时值六月中旬。战事停止了，除了如福克斯克罗夫特夫人一样的人以外，昨晚她在大使馆悲痛欲绝，她的好儿子战死了，如今那座古老的庄园只好归于她侄子名下；还有贝克斯伯勒女士，人们说她主持义卖开幕时，手中还握着电报，通知她最疼的儿子约翰阵亡了。不过战事停止了，感谢主——都停止了。时值六月。国王与王后都待在宫中。虽然时间尚早，四处已响起了有节奏的运动声、马驹奔跑的嗒嗒声、板球拍的轻叩声。洛兹板球场、爱斯科赛马场、拉内拉赫高尔夫俱乐部等所有娱乐场都淹没在柔软的类似网状的蓝灰色晨雾里。当白天一分一秒过去，雾渐消散，欢快的马驹会跑到娱乐场的草地与球场上，前蹄刚着地旋即一跃而起。还有转着圈的小伙子，笑容满面、身着透明纱衫的姑娘，即便此时，彻夜跳舞以后，还带上他们荒诞的毛茸茸的狗出来溜溜。而且即使现在，这样的时刻，那些谨慎的韶华已逝的遗孀们也上了汽车，急急忙忙投身于神秘的差使。店主们正手忙脚乱地在橱窗里摆放人造宝石和钻石，那美丽的古色古香的海绿色胸针镶在十八世纪样式的底座上诱使美国佬来买（但是一定要节俭，不要轻易给伊丽莎白买饰品）。她自己也喜爱这些珠宝，似乎怀着一种荒诞又虔诚的情感，因为她就是其中的一份子，她的先辈曾经是乔治时代的廷臣，她这个晚上也要闪亮辉煌地登场；参加她的聚会。可是一走进公园，那静谧是多么奇怪啊！那薄雾，那嗡嗡声，那悠然游走的欢快的鸭子，那步态摇摆的长有袋囊的鸟，那个迎面而来的人该是谁呢？他身后是政府大楼，完全没错，携带一个盖着皇室纹章的公文派送箱，正是休·惠特布雷德；她的故交休——可敬的休！","For it was the middle of June.The War was over, except for some one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was over; thank Heaven—over.It was June.The King and Queen were at the Palace.And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was a beating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run; and even now, at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery; and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old sea-green brooches in eighteenth-century settings to tempt Americans (but one must economise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth), and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party.But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh—the admirable Hugh!"
"“早安，克拉丽莎！”休煞有介事地问候道，因为他俩儿时便相识了。“你要动身去哪里？”","“Good morning to you, Clarissa!” said Hugh, rather extravagantly, for they had known each other as children.“Where are you off to?”"
"“我喜欢在伦敦步行。”达洛维夫人回答，“的确这胜过在乡村小路上溜达哩。”","“I love walking in London,” said Mrs. Dalloway.“Really it’s better than walking in the country.”"
"他们刚来伦敦——真遗憾——却是来寻医的。其他人到伦敦是想看电影，赏歌剧，把女儿带来开眼界，惠特布雷德一家却是来“看大夫”。克拉丽莎曾多次去护理院探望伊夫琳·惠特布雷德。难道伊夫琳又生病了？伊夫琳身体很不舒服，休说道，一边撅着嘴，挺着穿着考究、透着男子汉气概、英俊非凡、包装极好的身躯（他向来总是过分讲究穿着，不过想想也只能这样，他在宫里有份小差使），暗示他的夫人只得了点内科病，没什么大不了，作为故交，克拉丽莎·达洛维十分了解这些，而无需他具体阐明。　噢不错，她确实了解，这病真烦人。一股姐妹般的情愫油然而生，于此同时她又古灵精怪地注意到自己的帽子。大清早的戴这个帽子不合适，是吧？因为休忙着往前走时，颇为一本正经地向上抬了抬他的帽子，让她总觉得自己像是年方十八的姑娘，另外她今晚的聚会他也肯定会来，这是伊夫琳强烈要求的，只是可能会晚些到，他必须先带上吉姆的一个儿子参加宫廷宴会。和休在一起她总觉得自己有点不像样子，像个中学生。但是又依恋他，一是由于他俩早就相识，而且她的确认为休自有他好的地方，尽管理查德差点被他逼疯了，至于彼得·沃尔什，至今也没有宽恕她对休的爱。","They had just come up—unfortunately—to see doctors.Other people came to see pictures; go to the opera; take their daughters out; the Whitbreads came “to see doctors.”Times without number Clarissa had visited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home.Was Evelyn ill again?Evelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind of pout or swell of his very well-covered, manly, extremely handsome, perfectly upholstered body (he was almost too well dressed always, but presumably had to be, with his little job at Court) that his wife had some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend, Clarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify.Ah yes, she did of course; what a nuisance; and felt very sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat.Not the right hat for the early morning, was that it?For Hugh always made her feel, as he bustled on, raising his hat rather extravagantly and assuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen, and of course he was coming to her party tonight, Evelyn absolutely insisted, only a little late he might be after the party at the Palace to which he had to take one of Jim’s boys,—she always felt a little skimpy beside Hugh; schoolgirlish; but attached to him, partly from having known him always, but she did think him a good sort in his own way, though Richard was nearly driven mad by him, and as for Peter Walsh, he had never to this day forgiven her for liking him."
"伯顿的情景一幕接一幕浮现在她脑际——彼得暴跳如雷；当然，休无论如何也无法和他比，但也决非彼得声称的一个十足的傻瓜，不纯粹是理发师的木制假头。在他年迈的母亲希望他停止打猎或是把她带到巴斯去时，他没说半个不字就那么做了，他确实一点也不自私。至于彼得所讲的，休冷酷无情、没有头脑，有的仅仅是英国绅士的礼节与教养，这仅是她心爱的彼得心情极糟时的言语。他可能会让人无法容忍，使人难以相处，然而如此这般早晨跟他一起走走却是非常惬意的。","She could remember scene after scene at Bourton—Peter furious; Hugh not, of course, his match in any way, but still not a positive imbecile as Peter made out; not a mere barber’s block.When his old mother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to Bath he did it, without a word; he was really unselfish, and as for saying, as Peter did, that he had no heart, no brain, nothing but the manners and breeding of an English gentleman, that was only her dear Peter at his worst; and he could be intolerable; he could be impossible; but adorable to walk with on a morning like this."
"（六月里树木枝繁叶茂。皮姆利科的慈母们在给小孩喂奶。时不时有讯息从舰队街传到海军部。繁华的阿灵顿街和皮卡迪利大街仿佛使公园里热气蒸腾，绚烂的树叶翻飞在活力充沛的气浪上，克拉丽莎深爱这神圣的生命力。跳舞啊，骑马啊，她都喜欢。）","(June had drawn out every leaf on the trees.The mothers of Pimlico gave suck to their young.Messages were passing from the Fleet to the Admiralty.Arlington Street and Piccadilly seemed to chafe the very air in the Park and lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, on waves of that divine vitality which Clarissa loved.To dance, to ride, she had adored all that.)"
"他俩素未谋面也许好几百年了，彼得与她；她从未给他写信，而他的来信也写得干瘪枯燥；但是她冷不防会想起，若此时他在她身边他会说些什么呢？——某些日子、某些情景会让她静静地想起他，昔日的怨尤不复存在，这大概是对关心照顾别人的回报；她又想起一个明媚的早晨，他俩回到圣詹姆斯公园中央的情景——事实也如此。然而彼得——不论日子多么美好，树丛和草地、以及身穿粉红衣衫的小姑娘多么赏心悦目——彼得全都视若无睹。他会戴上眼镜的，要是她吩咐的话；他会瞅瞅。他关注的是世界形势，瓦格纳的音乐，蒲伯的诗，人类永恒的特性，以及她自身灵魂的缺陷。他是那样地斥责她！他俩是那样地争辩！他说她将嫁给首相并伫立在楼梯顶层；他称呼她为完美女主人（她曾在卧室为此哭泣），他说她天生就具有成为完美女主人的潜质。","For they might be parted for hundreds of years, she and Peter; she never wrote a letter and his were dry sticks; but suddenly it would come over her. If he were with me now what would he say?—some days, some sights bringing him back to her calmly, without the old bitterness; which perhaps was the reward of having cared for people; they came back in the middle of St. James’s Park on a fine morning—indeed they did.But Peter—however beautiful the day might be, and the trees and the grass, and the little girl in pink—Peter never saw a thing of all that.He would put on his spectacles, if she told him to; he would look.It was the state of the world that interested him; Wagner, Pope’s poetry, people’s characters eternally, and the defects of her own soul.How he scolded her!How they argued!She would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase; the perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her bedroom), she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said."
"于是她觉得自己还是在圣詹姆斯公园争辩着，还是声称她一直都没错——她也的确没错——没有嫁给他。因为在婚姻这张小小的证书里，同一个屋子天天相伴的夫妇一定要有小小的自主权；理查德给了她这种权利，她也满足了他。（例如他今儿早上去哪了？去某个委员会吧，她从来不问。）可彼得却要分享她的每件事情，而且都要知根知底。真让人无法容忍，而出现了那小巧的花园喷泉旁的场面后，她不得不与他断绝关系，不然他俩都要毁灭，双方都会崩溃，她毫不怀疑；尽管如此，她蒙受了多年如箭穿心的悲戚与苦痛；继而是那恐怖的一刻，有人在一次音乐会上向她透露，彼得已同在去往印度船上结识的一个女人结婚了！这一切她永不会忘却！冷漠、没心没肺、假正经，他如此责怪她。她永远不能明白他百般的关怀。不过那些印度女人可能明白——那傻傻的、俊俏的、娇弱的蠢货们。而她是在浪费自己的同情。因为他要她相信他过得很幸福——非常幸福，即使没做过一件他俩讨论过的事；他整个人生是个失败。这令她更加愤怒。","So she would still find herself arguing in St. James’s Park, still making out that she had been right—and she had too—not to marry him.For in marriage a little licence, a little independence there must be between people living together day in day out in the same house; which Richard gave her, and she him.(Where was he this morning for instance?Some committee, she never asked what.) But with Peter everything had to be shared; everything gone into.And it was intolerable, and when it came to that scene in the little garden by the fountain, she had to break with him or they would have been destroyed, both of them ruined, she was convinced; though she had borne about with her for years like an arrow sticking in her heart the grief, the anguish; and then the horror of the moment when some one told her at a concert that he had married a woman met on the boat going to India!Never should she forget all that!Cold, heartless, a prude, he called her.Never could she understand how he cared.But those Indian women did presumably—silly, pretty, flimsy nincompoops.And she wasted her pity.For he was quite happy, he assured her—perfectly happy, though he had never done a thing that they talked of; his whole life had been a failure.It made her angry still."
"她已走到公园门口了。她站了一会儿，注视着皮卡迪利大街上穿梭的公共汽车。","She had reached the Park gates.She stood for a moment, looking at the omnibuses in Piccadilly."
"如今她不想谈论世上任何人这样那样的是非。她觉得她十分青春，然而又无法形容地衰老。她就像刀一样切入每件事物，却又置身事外、袖手旁观。她观察着来往的出租马车，内心总有一种自己是远远地、远远地独自在海边的感觉；她总觉得即使活上一天也非常、非常危险。倒不是她认为自己聪敏或是不同凡响。她想不明白她是怎样用丹尼尔斯小姐传授的这点浅薄的学识生活下来的。她一无所知，不懂语言，不晓历史。除了在床上看看自传，她现在几乎不看书。可是对她来说有致命吸引力的是眼下的事物，这一切，穿梭的出租马车。她不想谈论彼得，她也不愿意谈论自己，说自己这样或者那样。","She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that.She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on.She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.Not that she thought herself clever, or much out of the ordinary.How she had got through life on the few twigs of knowledge Fraulein Daniels gave them she could not think.She knew nothing; no language, no history; she scarcely read a book now, except memoirs in bed; and yet to her it was absolutely absorbing; all this; the cabs passing; and she would not say of Peter, she would not say of herself, I am this, I am that."
"她仅有的天赋则是几乎能靠直觉识透别人，她沉思着，继续走着。要是让她和谁同处一室，她会如猫一般立即警惕地弓着背；要么她就猫一般得意地传出呜呜的声音。德文郡府邸、巴斯伯爵府、陈列着瓷凤头鹦鹉的宅第，她曾见过它们都灯火辉煌的时候；还记着西尔维娅、弗雷德、萨莉·西顿——如此一大群人，跳了一整夜的舞；四轮马车沉重缓慢地经过，赶往市场；她开车横穿公园回家。她记得曾往公园的瑟彭泰恩湖里投过一先令钱币。但是每个人都记得这样的事；她喜爱的是这一切、此地、此时、就在她面前；坐在出租马车里的丰满女人。那这要紧吗，她问自己，一面走向邦德街，要紧吗，她的生命难免会彻底终结；没有她一切仍会继续；她是否觉得怨恨？或者认为一死了之不也会给人带来一丝慰藉？但是不知何故在伦敦的大街上，在这里、在那里，经历了人世盛衰，她幸存下来了，彼得幸存下来了，活在彼此的心中。她坚信自己是故乡树林的一部分，是那栋丑陋的、破败不堪的房屋的一部分，是那些素未谋面的人们的一部分。她如薄雾一般在最熟悉的人们中间铺散开来，这些人把她擎在他们的枝蔓上，正如她曾见过的树木托着薄雾，而她却蔓延得如此遥远，她的生活、她自身。可她透过哈查德书店陈列窗时在幻想什么？她试图回想什么？当她读到翻开的书上的两行诗时，会构想出白色拂晓的乡村何等的场景？","Her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct, she thought, walking on.If you put her in a room with some one, up went her back like a cat’s; or she purred.Devonshire House, Bath House, the house with the china cockatoo, she had seen them all lit up once; and remembered Sylvia, Fred, Sally Seton—such hosts of people; and dancing all night; and the waggons plodding past to market; and driving home across the Park.She remembered once throwing a shilling into the Serpentine.But every one remembered; what she loved was this, here, now, in front of her; the fat lady in the cab.Did it matter then, she asked herself, walking towards Bond Street, did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely; all this must go on without her; did she resent it; or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely?but that somehow in the streets of London, on the ebb and flow of things, here, there, she survived, Peter survived, lived in each other, she being part, she was positive, of the trees at home; of the house there, ugly, rambling all to bits and pieces as it was; part of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life, herself.But what was she dreaming as she looked into Hatchards’ shop window?What was she trying to recover?What image of white dawn in the country, as she read in the book spread open:"
"不要再怕炎炎骄阳，不要再怕寒冬肆虐。","Fear no more the heat o’ the sun Nor the furious winter’s rages."
"最近世界遭受的一切已使他们全部人的内心，所有男女都泪泉奔涌。泪与悲、勇与忍、刚正不阿与坚韧不拔。譬如，想到她最崇拜的那位女士——贝克斯伯勒女士——她主持义卖开幕式的情景吧。","This late age of the world’s experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears.Tears and sorrows; courage and endurance; a perfectly upright and stoical bearing.Think, for example, of the woman she admired most, Lady Bexborough, opening the bazaar."
"陈列窗里有耶罗克斯的《旅游与欢宴》，还有《浸透肥皂的海绵》以及阿斯奎思夫人的《回忆录》和《尼日利亚射杀大猎物纪行》，都翻开着。那里向来就有很多书，但是看上去没有一本书十分适合给护理院的伊夫琳·惠特布雷德捎去。那个女人枯瘦娇小得无法形容，没有哪一本书能逗她开心，就连克拉丽莎到来时也不能让她显出片刻的热诚；接着他们坐下来开始喋喋不休地谈论妇科病。她多期望如此——人们在她到来时脸上会显露出愉悦的神情，克拉丽莎思索着，转身重新向邦德街走去，颇为不悦，因为为了其他什么原因做事情是很愚蠢的。她更愿自己像理查德一样，做事情只考虑自己。而她呢，她在等待过街时心里想半数时间她做事情并不是为了这些事情本身，而是为了使人这样想或那样想。她知道这是极端愚蠢的（此时警察在举手示意），因为没人受会上当，哪怕一秒钟。哎！要是她的人生可以重来就好了！她一边踏上人行道，一边思索，甚至连长相都不一样呢！","There were Jorrocks’ Jaunts and Jollities; there were Soapy Sponge and Mrs. Asquith’s Memoirs and Big Game Shooting in Nigeria, all spread open.Ever so many books there were; but none that seemed exactly right to take to Evelyn Whitbread in her nursing home.Nothing that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably dried-up little woman look, as Clarissa came in, just for a moment cordial; before they settled down for the usual interminable talk of women’s ailments.How much she wanted it—that people should look pleased as she came in, Clarissa thought and turned and walked back towards Bond Street, annoyed, because it was silly to have other reasons for doing things.Much rather would she have been one of those people like Richard who did things for themselves, whereas, she thought, waiting to cross, half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves; but to make people think this or that; perfect idiocy she knew (and now the policeman held up his hand) for no one was ever for a second taken in.Oh if she could have had her life over again!she thought, stepping on to the pavement, could have looked even differently!"
"首先，她会像贝克斯伯勒女士一般黑，长着褶皱皮革似的皮肤和漂亮的双眸。像贝克斯伯勒女士一样，她从容高贵、身材硕大，像男人一般爱好政治，在乡下有一处住宅，十分庄重，十分诚挚。而她自己的身材却像豌豆杆般瘦小，一张小脸令人发笑，嘴尖如喙。事实上她仪态优雅，手脚秀美，花钱很少却穿着得体。然而如今时不时她披着的这副躯体（她停下来凝视一幅荷兰画作），就是这副躯体，以及它拥有的种种功能好像都不存在了——完全不存在了。她有一种最怪异的感觉，以为自己无影无形、无人能见、无人所知；如今再也不用结婚，再也不用生养孩子，要做的只是这样惊奇又极庄重地与其他人一起往前走，沿邦德街上行。这是达洛维夫人，甚至再不是克拉丽莎，这是理查德·达洛维夫人。","She would have been, in the first place, dark like Lady Bexborough, with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes.She would have been, like Lady Bexborough, slow and stately; rather large; interested in politics like a man; with a country house; very dignified, very sincere.Instead of which she had a narrow pea-stick figure; a ridiculous little face, beaked like a bird’s.That she held herself well was true; and had nice hands and feet; and dressed well, considering that she spent little.But often now this body she wore (she stopped to look at a Dutch picture), this body, with all its capacities, seemed nothing—nothing at all.She had the oddest sense of being herself invisible; unseen; unknown; there being no more marrying, no more having of children now, but only this astonishing and rather solemn progress with the rest of them, up Bond Street, this being Mrs. Dalloway; not even Clarissa any more; this being Mrs. Richard Dalloway."
"邦德街让她着迷。旺季中清早的邦德街，街上旗儿飘飘，店铺，看不见大肆铺张，看不见庸俗炫耀；一卷斜纹软呢陈放在她父亲买衣服达五十年之久的一家店里，几粒珍珠，冰块上放着的大马哈鱼。","Bond Street fascinated her; Bond Street early in the morning in the season; its flags flying; its shops; no splash; no glitter; one roll of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for fifty years; a few pearls; salmon on an iceblock."
"“就是这些。”她说着，一边望着鱼贩的店。“就是这些。”她又说道，在一家手套商店的橱窗前停留片刻。战前，人们在那里能买到上好的手套。她年迈的威廉叔叔过去经常说从穿戴的鞋子和手套就能了解一个女人。战事期间的一个早晨，他在自己的床上逝去。他以前说过：“我经历的已经足够。”说到手套和鞋，她酷爱手套，可她的亲生女儿——她的伊丽莎白——对二者都毫无兴致。","“That is all,” she said, looking at the fishmonger’s.“That is all,” she repeated, pausing for a moment at the window of a glove shop where, before the War, you could buy almost perfect gloves.And her old Uncle William used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves.He had turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the War.He had said, “I have had enough.”Gloves and shoes; she had a passion for gloves; but her own daughter, her Elizabeth, cared not a straw for either of them."
"毫无兴致，她想着，持续沿邦德街上行，走向她每次举行宴会时为她预留鲜花的一个商店。伊丽莎白最在乎的实际上是她的狗。今儿早晨，房屋四处满是焦油味。虽然如此，不幸的小狗格丽泽尔仍胜过基尔曼小姐；犬疫和焦油味以及诸如此类的事情仍好过关在令人窒息的寝室里读一本祈祷书！任何事情都比这强，她几乎要这样说。不过这也许仅仅是一段时期，像理查德所言，诸如每个姑娘都会经历的那样。也许是坠入爱河。可是为何喜爱基尔曼小姐？她确实遭受过虐待，人们须体谅那点。理查德还说她非常有才干，具备真正的历史思维。不管怎么说，她俩是如影随形，伊丽莎白——她亲生的女儿——去参领圣餐了；至于她的着装怎样，她怎样对待前来享用午餐的宾客，她都毫不关心。因为她的经验就是对宗教的痴迷会让人麻木（笃信事业也会这样），让人情感冷漠。因为基尔曼小姐愿为俄国人做一切事情，愿替奥地利人食不果腹。可是私人的事情却给人以极度的折磨，她是如此无情，总披着一件绿色的防水外套。年复一年，她总穿着那件外套；她汗津津的，哪怕是呆在房里五分钟，她准让你感受到她的优越，你的卑微；她那么贫困，你那么殷富；她是怎样住在一个连垫子、床、小块地毯诸如此类都稀缺的贫民窟里啊。她整个灵魂都随根深蒂固的怨恨锈蚀了。战时她遭学校勒令退学——如此可怜的、满腹辛酸的、不幸的人！其实为人所憎的不是她本人，而是她的观点。毋庸置疑，她的想法在很大程度上有悖于她作为基尔曼小姐的本性；她化为了人们夜里与之争斗的幽灵中的一员，那种骑在我们身上吸干我们一半鲜血的幽灵之一，变为主宰者和专制者的一员；因为毫无疑问，若重新投骰，要是黑色而不是白色占上风，她也许会爱上基尔曼小姐！不过在此世不会。绝不。然而，这激怒了她，任这个暴戾的怪物扰乱她的内心！她在她的灵魂——这片枝叶繁茂的森林深处听见了树枝的断裂声、马蹄的踩踏声，永远感觉不到十分地满足或完全地可靠。因为这个暴徒随时都会捣乱，尤其从她生病以来，这仇恨使她有被擦伤、脊骨疼痛之感，使她的肉体感到痛苦，还让她在漂亮、友情、健康、关爱以及打造快乐之家中享受的所有愉悦出现动摇、颤抖和扭曲，好像确实有个怪物在挖掘根基，就像披在心满意足之上的全副铠甲仅仅是自我陶醉一般！这样的仇恨！","Not a straw, she thought, going on up Bond Street to a shop where they kept flowers for her when she gave a party.Elizabeth really cared for her dog most of all.The whole house this morning smelt of tar.Still, better poor Grizzle than Miss Kilman; better distemper and tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer book!Better anything, she was inclined to say.But it might be only a phase, as Richard said, such as all girls go through.It might be falling in love.But why with Miss Kilman?who had been badly treated of course; one must make allowances for that, and Richard said she was very able, had a really historical mind.Anyhow they were inseparable, and Elizabeth, her own daughter, went to Communion; and how she dressed, how she treated people who came to lunch she did not care a bit, it being her experience that the religious ecstasy made people callous (so did causes); dulled their feelings, for Miss Kilman would do anything for the Russians, starved herself for the Austrians, but in private inflicted positive torture, so insensitive was she, dressed in a green mackintosh coat.Year in year out she wore that coat; she perspired; she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her superiority, your inferiority; how poor she was; how rich you were; how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it, her dismissal from school during the War—poor embittered unfortunate creature!For it was not her one hated but the idea of her, which undoubtedly had gathered into itself a great deal that was not Miss Kilman; had become one of those spectres with which one battles in the night; one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our life-blood, dominators and tyrants; for no doubt with another throw of the dice, had the black been uppermost and not the white, she would have loved Miss Kilman!But not in this world. No.It rasped her, though, to have stirring about in her this brutal monster!to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the depths of that leaf-encumbered forest, the soul; never to be content quite, or quite secure, for at any moment the brute would be stirring, this hatred, which, especially since her illness, had power to make her feel scraped, hurt in her spine; gave her physical pain, and made all pleasure in beauty, in friendship, in being well, in being loved and making her home delightful rock, quiver, and bend as if indeed there were a monster grubbing at the roots, as if the whole panoply of content were nothing but self love! this hatred!"
"荒唐、无聊！她朝自己叫喊，同时推动花商马尔伯里店里的旋转门。","Nonsense, nonsense!she cried to herself, pushing through the swing doors of Mulberry’s the florists."
"她向前走去，体态轻盈、身材颀长、腰板笔直，长着一张纽扣般圆脸的皮姆小姐立即前来迎接。她的手永远显出明亮的红色，像是一直擎着花插在冰冷的水中一般。","She advanced, light, tall, very upright, to be greeted at once by button-faced Miss Pym, whose hands were always bright red, as if they had been stood in cold water with the flowers."
"这里鲜花遍地：飞燕草、麝香豌豆花、一扎扎紫丁香以及康乃馨，一大片康乃馨。这里还有玫瑰、鸢尾。啊！真好看——她与受过她恩惠的皮姆小姐站着说话时闻着混着泥土味儿的花园的芳香。皮姆小姐觉得她为人和善，很多年以前就为人和善、十分和善。可她今年看起来老了一些，她在鸢尾、玫瑰丛以及摇曳多姿的一簇簇紫丁香中转来转去，半闭着眼睛，在经历了街市的喧闹后，贪心地吮入这怡人的花香、这沁透心扉的凉爽。继而她睁开眼睛，看上去那玫瑰宛若洗衣店洗净后、置于藤条织篮里镶花边的亚麻布一样清新；红色康乃馨深暗庄重、翘首示意；全部的麝香豌豆花都铺在盘里，浅紫罗兰色、洁白、灰白——似乎眼下即是傍晚时分，女孩们身着薄纱衣裙在明媚的夏日黄昏里外出采集麝香豌豆花和玫瑰，天空近乎墨蓝，飞燕草、康乃馨、海芋遍地皆是；此刻是傍晚六点到七点——玫瑰、康乃馨、鸢尾、紫丁香——所有的花都绚烂盛开；白的、紫的、红的、深橙的；每一朵花好像都在薄雾的苗圃里燃烧自己，那么轻柔、纯粹；她是那样喜爱那只灰白的飞蛾，绕着香水草，绕着报春花旋入旋出！","There were flowers: delphiniums, sweet peas, bunches of lilac; and carnations, masses of carnations.There were roses; there were irises.Ah yes—so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as she stood talking to Miss Pym who owed her help, and thought her kind, for kind she had been years ago; very kind, but she looked older, this year, turning her head from side to side among the irises and roses and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed, snuffing in, after the street uproar, the delicious scent, the exquisite coolness.And then, opening her eyes, how fresh like frilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked; and dark and prim the red carnations, holding their heads up; and all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls, tinged violet, snow white, pale—as if it were the evening and girls in muslin frocks came out to pick sweet peas and roses after the superb summer’s day, with its almost blue-black sky, its delphiniums, its carnations, its arum lilies was over; and it was the moment between six and seven when every flower—roses, carnations, irises, lilac—glows; white, violet, red, deep orange; every flower seems to burn by itself, softly, purely in the misty beds; and how she loved the grey-white moths spinning in and out, over the cherry pie, over the evening primroses!"
"然后她和皮姆小姐开始沿花坛挨个走去，挑挑拣拣，荒唐、无聊，她嘟哝着，声音越来越温柔。似乎这种美、这种香、这种颜色，以及喜欢她、信赖她的皮姆小姐一起形成一阵她任其淹没自己的浪涌，以克服那嫉恨、那怪物、克服一切；这浪涌托着她愈升愈高直到这时——天哪！外边街上传来一声枪响！","And as she began to go with Miss Pym from jar to jar, choosing, nonsense, nonsense, she said to herself, more and more gently, as if this beauty, this scent, this colour, and Miss Pym liking her, trusting her, were a wave which she let flow over her and surmount that hatred, that monster, surmount it all; and it lifted her up and up when—oh!a pistol shot in the street outside!"
"“天哪，那些汽车。”皮姆小姐说着，满手捧着麝香豌豆花去窗边瞧了瞧，又返回来并致以抱歉的一笑，似乎那些汽车、那些漏气车胎都是她的错。","“Dear, those motor cars,” said Miss Pym, going to the window to look, and coming back and smiling apologetically with her hands full of sweet peas, as if those motor cars, those tyres of motor cars, were all HER fault."
"这一剧烈的爆破声吓得达洛维夫人跳了起来。皮姆小姐走到窗边略感歉意，这声巨响来自于刚停在马尔伯里店窗户正对面人行道旁的一辆汽车。路上行人当然皆驻足观望，碰巧瞧见靠在车内鸽灰色座椅上的一位首要人物的脸孔，然后一位男士的手拉下遮帘，除了一片鸽灰色就什么都看不清楚了。","The violent explosion which made Mrs. Dalloway jump and Miss Pym go to the window and apologise came from a motor car which had drawn to the side of the pavement precisely opposite Mulberry’s shop window.Passers-by who, of course, stopped and stared, had just time to see a face of the very greatest importance against the dove-grey upholstery, before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing to be seen except a square of dove grey."
"可是谣传从邦德街中段立即传出来，一头传到了牛津街，另一头传到了阿特金森街的香水店，传得无从察觉、无声无息，犹如一片浮云，迅速移动如纱幔般遮住山峰，的确似浮云般突至的冷静和庄重飘降在前一秒钟还全然混乱无章的人们的脸上。可如今神秘的羽翼轻拂过人们，他们已经聆听了权威的声音，宗教之神灵无处不在，她的双目被紧紧蒙住，双唇大张着。然而无人知晓看到的脸孔是谁。难道这脸孔属于威尔士亲王，属于王后，或属于首相？到底属于谁？无人知晓。","Yet rumours were at once in circulation from the middle of Bond Street to Oxford Street on one side, to Atkinson’s scent shop on the other, passing invisibly, inaudibly, like a cloud, swift, veil-like upon hills, falling indeed with something of a cloud’s sudden sobriety and stillness upon faces which a second before had been utterly disorderly.But now mystery had brushed them with her wing; they had heard the voice of authority; the spirit of religion was abroad with her eyes bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide.But nobody knew whose face had been seen.Was it the Prince of Wales’s, the Queen’s, the Prime Minister’s?Whose face was it?Nobody knew."
"埃德加·J.沃基斯一只手臂上缠着一圈铅管，用能听得见的、当然很滑稽的音调说：“修（首）相的机（汽）车。”","Edgar J. Watkiss, with his roll of lead piping round his arm, said audibly, humorously of course: “The Proime Minister’s kyar.”"
"塞普蒂默斯·沃伦·史密斯发现自己不能通行，听到了他的话。","Septimus Warren Smith, who found himself unable to pass, heard him."
"塞普蒂默斯·沃伦·史密斯年纪大约三十，面色苍白，鹰钩鼻，穿着褐色鞋子和一件破旧的大衣，浅褐色的眸子里那疑惧的神色使完全陌生之人也心生疑惧。世界已经高举鞭子，它将在哪里落下？","Septimus Warren Smith, aged about thirty, pale-faced, beak-nosed, wearing brown shoes and a shabby overcoat, with hazel eyes which had that look of apprehension in them which makes complete strangers apprehensive too.The world has raised its whip; where will it descend?"
"一切都静止下来。汽车引擎的颤动听起来像经过浑身上下不规则跳动的脉搏。由于汽车泊在马尔伯里店窗外，阳光变得格外灼热；几个坐在公共汽车上层的老妇人撑起了黑色的遮阳伞；这里是把绿伞，那里又是把红伞轻轻地啪地一声撑开。达洛维夫人双臂捧着麝香豌豆花走到窗边，皱起娇小的粉红脸颊，疑云满面地朝外望。每个人都注视着这汽车。塞普蒂默斯也注视着。骑在自行车上的男孩们跳下了车。交通拥挤起来。这汽车泊在那里，遮帘拉下了，而遮帘上印着的树状图形真奇怪，塞普蒂默斯这样想着。而这种就在他眼前把一切汇聚到一个中心来，就像某种即将浮现的恐怖转眼就会喷出火焰，令他感到十分恐惧。世界在摇晃颤动，似乎就要熊熊燃烧起来。挡着路的是我，他想。难道他没有在众目睽睽之下受人指斥吗？难道他不是出于某种意图，占着人行道一动也不动吗？可究竟是何种目的？","Everything had come to a standstill.The throb of the motor engines sounded like a pulse irregularly drumming through an entire body.The sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had stopped outside Mulberry’s shop window; old ladies on the tops of omnibuses spread their black parasols; here a green, here a red parasol opened with a little pop.Mrs. Dalloway, coming to the window with her arms full of sweet peas, looked out with her little pink face pursed in enquiry.Every one looked at the motor car.Septimus looked.Boys on bicycles sprang off.Traffic accumulated.And there the motor car stood, with drawn blinds, and upon them a curious pattern like a tree, Septimus thought, and this gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes, as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames, terrified him.The world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames.It is I who am blocking the way, he thought.Was he not being looked at and pointed at; was he not weighted there, rooted to the pavement, for a purpose?But for what purpose?"
"“塞普蒂默斯，我们继续走吧。”他夫人叫他，这是一个娇小的女人，一对大眼睛嵌在土黄的尖脸上，一个意大利女子。","“Let us go on, Septimus,” said his wife, a little woman, with large eyes in a sallow pointed face; an Italian girl."
"可卢克雷齐娅自己不由自主地注视着这汽车和遮帘上的树状图形。难道王后在车里——王后会去购物？","But Lucrezia herself could not help looking at the motor car and the tree pattern on the blinds.Was it the Queen in there—the Queen going shopping?"
"汽车司机一直在忙着打开、旋转、关闭某些部件，此时坐进了驾驶室。","The chauffeur, who had been opening something, turning something, shutting something, got on to the box."
"“快点。”卢克雷齐娅喊道。","“Come on,” said Lucrezia."
"可是和她结婚四五年的丈夫此时吃惊地一跳，生气地说：“行啦！”仿佛她打扰了他。","But her husband, for they had been married four, five years now, jumped, started, and said, “All right!” angrily, as if she had interrupted him."
"人们肯定留意了，人们肯定看到了。人们，她想着，一边看着盯着汽车的群众，英国人，还有他们的小孩、马驹和服装，她对这一切有着某种程度的艳羡。不过此刻他们仅仅是“民众”，因塞普蒂默斯曾说：“我会自杀”。这样说真恐怖。假设别人听到他的话了呢？她注视着人群。救命，救命！她想朝着肉贩的伙计和女人们呼喊。救命！就在上个秋季，塞普蒂默斯与她曾合穿同一件披风站在泰晤士河堤上，塞普蒂默斯没有说话，而是在看报纸，她抢过他的报纸，当着注意到他们的老人的面大笑起来！但人会对挫败进行掩饰。她一定要让他离开这里去一个公园。","People must notice; people must see.People, she thought, looking at the crowd staring at the motor car; the English people, with their children and their horses and their clothes, which she admired in a way; but they were “people” now, because Septimus had said, “I will kill myself”; an awful thing to say.Suppose they had heard him?She looked at the crowd.Help, help!she wanted to cry out to butchers’ boys and women.Help!Only last autumn she and Septimus had stood on the Embankment wrapped in the same cloak and, Septimus reading a paper instead of talking, she had snatched it from him and laughed in the old man’s face who saw them!But failure one conceals.She must take him away into some park."
"“我们现在就过街吧。”她建议道。","“Now we will cross,” she said."
"她有挽着他手臂的权利，即使没有任何感觉。他愿意让她挽着。她那么纯朴、那么冲动，年纪仅二十四岁，在英国没有一个朋友，因他的缘故才离开了意大利，瘦得皮包骨头。","She had a right to his arm, though it was without feeling.He would give her, who was so simple, so impulsive, only twenty-four, without friends in England, who had left Italy for his sake, a piece of bone."
"那挡上遮帘的、神秘莫测的汽车开向了皮卡迪利大街，仍旧受到人们的注视，仍旧激起大街两旁凝视的面庞同样神秘崇敬的表情，而是否是王后、王子还是首相，无人知晓。车里的面孔只有三个人在几秒钟内看到过一次。甚至那是男是女都争执不下。不过无可争议的是坐在车里的是位重要人物。这位重要人物正秘密地驶过邦德街，与普通民众仅一步之遥。这些人或许是第一次也是最后一次与英国君主、与一国永恒的象征近乎面对面的距离。等到以后伦敦成了荒草丛生的田间小径，而本周三早上那所有急急忙忙走在人行道的人们只剩骷髅一堆，还有几颗散在遗骸灰烬中的婚戒和不计其数的腐烂牙齿中的金制填料，到了那时，爱探究的古物学者在岁月的遗迹中审视研究，桥车里的脸才会水落石出。十有八九是王后，达洛维夫人想，拿着花从马尔伯里店走出来。就是王后。这汽车仍用遮帘掩着，从距她仅一英尺远处经过时，她正站在太阳照射下的花店边，而她一刹那就露出无比庄重的神情。王后或是去什么医院，或是要去主持什么义卖会开幕，克拉丽莎寻思着。","The motor car with its blinds drawn and an air of inscrutable reserve proceeded towards Piccadilly, still gazed at, still ruffling the faces on both sides of the street with the same dark breath of veneration whether for Queen, Prince, or Prime Minister nobody knew.The face itself had been seen only once by three people for a few seconds.Even the sex was now in dispute.But there could be no doubt that greatness was seated within; greatness was passing, hidden, down Bond Street, removed only by a hand’s-breadth from ordinary people who might now, for the first and last time, be within speaking distance of the majesty of England, of the enduring symbol of the state which will be known to curious antiquaries, sifting the ruins of time, when London is a grass-grown path and all those hurrying along the pavement this Wednesday morning are but bones with a few wedding rings mixed up in their dust and the gold stoppings of innumerable decayed teeth. The face in the motor car will then be known.It is probably the Queen, thought Mrs. Dalloway, coming out of Mulberry’s with her flowers; the Queen.And for a second she wore a look of extreme dignity standing by the flower shop in the sunlight while the car passed at a foot’s pace, with its blinds drawn.The Queen going to some hospital; the Queen opening some bazaar, thought Clarissa."
"这个时候交通却这般拥堵。是洛兹板球场、爱斯科赛马场、乌林汉姆英国马球总会有比赛，还是什么？她感到奇怪，因为街道非常拥堵。在公共汽车上层两旁坐着的英国中产阶级的人们带着手包和伞。是的，这样的天气还穿着毛皮衣服多荒唐，可笑得难以想象，她这样想着。王后也被堵住了，王后自己也过不去。克拉丽莎在布鲁克街一边被拦住。约翰·巴克赫斯特爵士，这位上了年纪的法官在另一边被拦住，而那车就在他们中间（约翰爵士参与法律制定好些年了且喜爱打扮入时的女子）。此时汽车司机把身子轻微倾斜，向警察说了什么或出示了某样东西，于是警察行礼致意，举起手臂，一甩头让公共汽车移到一边，那辆车便开过去了。　那车缓慢又非常安静地开走了。","The crush was terrific for the time of day.Lords, Ascot, Hurlingham, what was it?she wondered, for the street was blocked.The British middle classes sitting sideways on the tops of omnibuses with parcels and umbrellas, yes, even furs on a day like this, were, she thought, more ridiculous, more unlike anything there has ever been than one could conceive; and the Queen herself held up; the Queen herself unable to pass.Clarissa was suspended on one side of Brook Street; Sir John Buckhurst, the old Judge on the other, with the car between them (Sir John had laid down the law for years and liked a well-dressed woman) when the chauffeur, leaning ever so slightly, said or showed something to the policeman, who saluted and raised his arm and jerked his head and moved the omnibus to the side and the car passed through.Slowly and very silently it took its way."
"克拉丽莎猜对了，克拉丽莎显然清楚，她已看到侍从手中有个白色的、有着魔力的圆盘，上面刻着人名——是王后的，或威尔士亲王的，还是首相的？它借助自身的光芒烧开了一条通道（克拉丽莎眼见那车越来越小，消失了）。那天晚上，它将在白金汉宫异彩纷呈，在巨大的枝状烛台、闪烁的星形勋章、挺拔的挂着橡树叶的胸膛、休·惠特布雷德及所有他的同仁、英格兰的绅士们中间熠熠生辉。而克拉丽莎也要举行宴会。她微微直了直身子，站在她家楼梯的顶层。","Clarissa guessed; Clarissa knew of course; she had seen something white, magical, circular, in the footman’s hand, a disc inscribed with a name,—the Queen’s, the Prince of Wales’s, the Prime Minister’s?—which, by force of its own lustre, burnt its way through (Clarissa saw the car diminishing, disappearing), to blaze among candelabras, glittering stars, breasts stiff with oak leaves, Hugh Whitbread and all his colleagues, the gentlemen of England, that night in Buckingham Palace.And Clarissa, too, gave a party.She stiffened a little; so she would stand at the top of her stairs."
"那车开走了，可它留下了一丝涟漪，穿过了邦德街两旁的手套店、帽店、裁缝店。三十秒钟的时间里所有人的头都朝着一个方向——窗口。正拣选手套的女士们——需要齐肘的或者肘以上的手套，柠檬黄还是淡灰？都停了下来，话音刚落就有事发生。这事独自发生时很不起眼，无论哪种精确仪器，即使能传达发生在中国的地震，也不能记下它的震颤。但是当它聚拢到一起时就产生令人敬畏的力量，能够激起公众的情感。因为所有帽店和裁缝店中的陌生人相互看着，联想到逝者、联想到国旗、联想到大英帝国。后街酒馆中一个殖民地居民出言冒犯了温莎王室，导致口角之争，啤酒玻璃杯打碎了，随之出现一阵骚乱。喧闹声穿过街怪异地回荡在小姐们耳中，她们在替自己的婚礼选购有纯白缎带纹路的白色内衣。经过这里的小汽车引发的表面激动慢慢平静下来，却触动了某种极为深沉的情愫。","The car had gone, but it had left a slight ripple which flowed through glove shops and hat shops and tailors’ shops on both sides of Bond Street.For thirty seconds all heads were inclined the same way—to the window.Choosing a pair of gloves—should they be to the elbow or above it, lemon or pale grey?—ladies stopped; when the sentence was finished something had happened.Something so trifling in single instances that no mathematical instrument, though capable of transmitting shocks in China, could register the vibration; yet in its fulness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional; for in all the hat shops and tailors’ shops strangers looked at each other and thought of the dead; of the flag; of Empire.In a public house in a back street a Colonial insulted the House of Windsor which led to words, broken beer glasses, and a general shindy, which echoed strangely across the way in the ears of girls buying white underlinen threaded with pure white ribbon for their weddings.For the surface agitation of the passing car as it sunk grazed something very profound."
"那车滑过了皮卡迪利大街，拐进了圣詹姆斯大街。高个子男人、体格强健的男人、身穿燕尾服和白裤子又向后梳着头发的、打扮入时的男人，不知什么原因，这时都站在布鲁克斯酒家的凸窗前，双手背在燕尾服后面，向外看去。他们本能地意识到有重要人物正打这里驶过，不朽的伟人散发的微光照在他们身上，就像它刚才照在了克拉丽莎·达洛维身上一样。煞那间，他们挺得更直了，又把手从背后移开，仿佛已做好准备侍奉君王，若有必要，他们会冲到炮口下，正如他们祖先以前所做的那样。背后的白色半身雕像和摆放着《闲谈者》杂志以及苏打水弯管的小桌子好像也在表示赞许，仿佛它们意味着英格兰翻滚的麦浪和庄园房屋，又仿佛把车胎微弱的嗡嗡声反射回去，正如回音廊的墙壁反射声音，借着大教堂的力量，使声音变得高亢响亮。身披围巾的莫尔·普拉特手拿鲜花站在人行道上，祝愿那亲爱的年轻人身体健康（里面一定是威尔士亲王）。要不是看到警察正盯着她，妨碍她这个爱尔兰老妇人一表忠心，她就会出于纯粹的轻松和对贫困的蔑视，将一壶啤酒的钱——一束玫瑰——扔到圣詹姆斯大街上。圣詹姆斯宫殿的哨兵们敬礼示意，亚历山德拉王后的警官表示赞许。","Gliding across Piccadilly, the car turned down St. James’s Street.Tall men, men of robust physique, well-dressed men with their tail-coats and their white slips and their hair raked back who, for reasons difficult to discriminate, were standing in the bow window of Brooks’s with their hands behind the tails of their coats, looking out, perceived instinctively that greatness was passing, and the pale light of the immortal presence fell upon them as it had fallen upon Clarissa Dalloway.At once they stood even straighter, and removed their hands, and seemed ready to attend their Sovereign, if need be, to the cannon’s mouth, as their ancestors had done before them.The white busts and the little tables in the background covered with copies of the Tatler and syphons of soda water seemed to approve; seemed to indicate the flowing corn and the manor houses of England; and to return the frail hum of the motor wheels as the walls of a whispering gallery return a single voice expanded and made sonorous by the might of a whole cathedral.Shawled Moll Pratt with her flowers on the pavement wished the dear boy well (it was the Prince of Wales for certain) and would have tossed the price of a pot of beer—a bunch of roses—into St. James’s Street out of sheer light-heartedness and contempt of poverty had she not seen the constable’s eye upon her, discouraging an old Irishwoman’s loyalty.The sentries at St. James’s saluted; Queen Alexandra’s policeman approved."
"一小队民众此刻已聚拢在白金汉宫门口。他们这些穷人无精打采，又沉着自信地等候着，注视着那旗帜飞扬的宫殿，注视着高台上衣裙飞舞的维多利亚女王，欣赏她周围的层层流水，她的天竺葵。从摩尔街的汽车中一会儿选中这一辆，一会儿又是另一辆。将感情徒劳地赋予驾车的平民。在东一辆西一辆的车驶过时又收回他们的称赞保存起来。整个过程，他们听任谣传在他们血管中聚集，刺激着大腿的神经细胞，想着王室在看着他们。王后在鞠躬行礼，亲王在致敬，想到上帝赐予君王们天国般的日子，想起宫廷侍者和屈膝深深行礼，想到王后以前的玩的玩偶之家，想到玛丽公主与一位英格兰人结婚了，而亲王——啊！亲王！","A small crowd meanwhile had gathered at the gates of Buckingham Palace.Listlessly, yet confidently, poor people all of them, they waited; looked at the Palace itself with the flag flying; at Victoria, billowing on her mound, admired her shelves of running water, her geraniums; singled out from the motor cars in the Mall first this one, then that; bestowed emotion, vainly, upon commoners out for a drive; recalled their tribute to keep it unspent while this car passed and that; and all the time let rumour accumulate in their veins and thrill the nerves in their thighs at the thought of Royalty looking at them; the Queen bowing; the Prince saluting; at the thought of the heavenly life divinely bestowed upon Kings; of the equerries and deep curtsies; of the Queen’s old doll’s house; of Princess Mary married to an Englishman, and the Prince—ah! the Prince!"
"人们说他与老国王爱德华长得极像，不过更加纤细。王子住在圣詹姆斯宫，不过早晨他也许会来看望他的母后。","who took wonderfully, they said, after old King Edward, but was ever so much slimmer.The Prince lived at St. James’s; but he might come along in the morning to visit his mother."
"莎拉·布莱奇利怀抱婴儿这样说的。她不停踮着脚尖，像是在皮姆利科家中壁炉围栏前一样，但她却一直盯着摩尔街，此时埃米莉·科茨环顾着宫殿的窗口，想象着女佣、无数的女佣、卧房、无数的卧房。一位领着一条阿伯丁犬的老绅士，和一些无业游民也加入进来，人越聚越多。鲍利先生个子矮小，在奥尔巴尼市有一套房间。他生命深处的源泉已经被蜡封住了，但见到此情此景——贫穷的、等着目送王后通过的女人——贫穷的女士、乖巧的孩子、孤儿、寡妇、战事——却突然地、不适宜地、伤感地将蜡打开，唏嘘感叹着，他的眼中真的含着泪水。一阵暖融融的微风在稀稀落落的树木中吹过摩尔街，吹过青铜英雄雕像，吹得鲍利先生这个英国人心胸中的旗帜飘扬起来。那车驶入摩尔街时，他脱帽示意，车临近时他高举着帽子，任皮姆利科贫困的母亲们紧压着他，挺得直直的。那车驶过来了。","So Sarah Bletchley said with her baby in her arms, tipping her foot up and down as though she were by her own fender in Pimlico, but keeping her eyes on the Mall, while Emily Coates ranged over the Palace windows and thought of the housemaids, the innumerable housemaids, the bedrooms, the innumerable bedrooms.Joined by an elderly gentleman with an Aberdeen terrier, by men without occupation, the crowd increased.Little Mr. Bowley, who had rooms in the Albany and was sealed with wax over the deeper sources of life but could be unsealed suddenly, inappropriately, sentimentally, by this sort of thing—poor women waiting to see the Queen go past—poor women, nice little children, orphans, widows, the War—tut-tut—actually had tears in his eyes.A breeze flaunting ever so warmly down the Mall through the thin trees, past the bronze heroes, lifted some flag flying in the British breast of Mr. Bowley and he raised his hat as the car turned into the Mall and held it high as the car approached; and let the poor mothers of Pimlico press close to him, and stood very upright.The car came on."
"猛然间科茨夫人抬头向天上望去。飞机那不详的声音刺入人群的耳中。它快飞到树林上方了，机尾冒出白色烟雾，回旋扭转，竟是在写什么！在空中写字！每个人都向上仰望。","Suddenly Mrs. Coates looked up into the sky.The sound of an aeroplane bored ominously into the ears of the crowd.There it was coming over the trees, letting out white smoke from behind, which curled and twisted, actually writing something!Making letters in the sky!Every one looked up."
"飞机陡然下降后直冲云霄，转了一圈，又疾速前进、下坠、升高，然而不管怎么飞，不管飞到哪里，总有一股浓浓的、波纹似的白烟从机尾冒出，在空中回旋缭绕地形成字母。可是写的什么字母？写的A与C吗？一个E，还有一个L？它们在空中定格仅仅是一瞬；接着便飘移、扩散直到在空中没有一丝痕迹，飞机很快飞远了，又一次飞到一片新天地中，着手写个k，一个E，或许再来一个Y？","Dropping dead down the aeroplane soared straight up, curved in a loop, raced, sank, rose, and whatever it did, wherever it went, out fluttered behind it a thick ruffled bar of white smoke which curled and wreathed upon the sky in letters.But what letters?A C was it? an E, then an L?Only for a moment did they lie still; then they moved and melted and were rubbed out up in the sky, and the aeroplane shot further away and again, in a fresh space of sky, began writing a K, an E, a Y perhaps?"
"“Glaxo。”　科茨夫人带着紧张、畏惧的音调念道，同时仰头凝视天空，而她白皙的宝宝一动不动地躺在她的怀中，也抬头望着天。","“Glaxo,” said Mrs. Coates in a strained, awe-stricken voice, gazing straight up, and her baby, lying stiff and white in her arms, gazed straight up."
"“Kreemo。”布莱奇利夫人嘀咕道，就像个梦游者。鲍利先生完全一动不动地用手举着帽子，抬头望着天。整个摩尔街的人都伫立着向天空望去。","“Kreemo,” murmured Mrs. Bletchley, like a sleepwalker.With his hat held out perfectly still in his hand, Mr. Bowley gazed straight up.All down the Mall people were standing and looking up into the sky."
"就在他们抬头仰望时，整个世界变得非常静谧，一队海鸥从空中掠过，起初有一只海鸥领队，随即又有一只，在这异常的静谧和安宁中，在这苍白和纯净中，钟声敲了十一次，余音在海鸥中逐渐消散。","As they looked the whole world became perfectly silent, and a flight of gulls crossed the sky, first one gull leading, then another, and in this extraordinary silence and peace, in this pallor, in this purity, bells struck eleven times, the sound fading up there among the gulls."
"飞机任意地改变方向、急速前行、又陡然下降，迅速敏捷、自由自在，活像一个溜冰员。","The aeroplane turned and raced and swooped exactly where it liked, swiftly, freely, like a skater—"
"“那是E。”布莱奇利夫人说道——或者是一个舞蹈家——","“That’s an E,” said Mrs. Bletchley—or a dancer—"
"“这是toffee。”鲍利先生念叨着——那辆车驶入大门却没人看它，飞机不再喷烟，迅速飞离，愈来愈远，那烟消散开了，积聚在一团团白云周围。","“It’s toffee,” murmured Mr. Bowley—(and the car went in at the gates and nobody looked at it), and shutting off the smoke, away and away it rushed, and the smoke faded and assembled itself round the broad white shapes of the clouds."
"飞机飞走了，消失在云背后。周围阒寂无声。衬托着字母E、G或L的云朵随心所欲地移动着，仿佛注定要从西移到东去完成一项极重大的任务，这又绝不能透露，但的确是这样——一项极重大的任务。一瞬间，飞机像开出隧道的列车，又倏地钻出云端，轰鸣之声响彻摩尔街、格林公园、皮卡迪利大街、摄政街、摄政公园里所有人的耳鼓。机身后冒出一股扭曲的白烟，飞机下坠、上升，相继写出一个个字母——但写出了什么字呢？　","It had gone; it was behind the clouds.There was no sound.The clouds to which the letters E, G, or L had attached themselves moved freely, as if destined to cross from West to East on a mission of the greatest importance which would never be revealed, and yet certainly so it was—a mission of the greatest importance.Then suddenly, as a train comes out of a tunnel, the aeroplane rushed out of the clouds again, the sound boring into the ears of all people in the Mall, in the Green Park, in Piccadilly, in Regent Street, in Regent’s Park, and the bar of smoke curved behind and it dropped down, and it soared up and wrote one letter after another—but what word was it writing?"
"卢克雷齐娅·沃伦·史密斯在摄政公园大道旁的座位上挨着丈夫坐着，抬头看着天。","Lucrezia Warren Smith, sitting by her husband’s side on a seat in Regent’s Park in the Broad Walk, looked up."
"“看那里，看那里，塞普蒂默斯！”她大喊着。因为霍姆斯医生对她说过要使她丈夫（他其实一点病没有，只是心情有些不好）把兴趣放在身外之事上。","“Look, look, Septimus!” she cried.For Dr. Holmes had told her to make her husband (who had nothing whatever seriously the matter with him but was a little out of sorts) take an interest in things outside himself."
"塞普蒂默斯仰望天空，在想原来他们正在向我发送暗号。其实并非是具体的词，也就是说，他还不能理解这语言。但这美、出奇的美再显然不过了。他凝视着天上烟雾组成的字淡化消散时，他的双眼满含热泪，这些字用他们无限的仁慈和笑的善意赐予他一个接一个不可思议的美。而且暗示他，他们的意图让他无偿地、永恒地看到美、更多的美！眼泪从他的脸颊上流了下来。","So, thought Septimus, looking up, they are signalling to me.Not indeed in actual words; that is, he could not read the language yet; but it was plain enough, this beauty, this exquisite beauty, and tears filled his eyes as he looked at the smoke words languishing and melting in the sky and bestowing upon him in their inexhaustible charity and laughing goodness one shape after another of unimaginable beauty and signalling their intention to provide him, for nothing, for ever, for looking merely, with beauty, more beauty!Tears ran down his cheeks."
"那是太妃糖，他们在为太妃糖做广告，一位保姆告诉雷齐娅。她们一齐开始拼着t……o……f……","It was toffee; they were advertising toffee, a nursemaid told Rezia.Together they began to spell t... o... f..."
"“K……R……”保姆说道，塞普蒂默斯听到她念“凯·阿尔”， 她凑近他耳边，音色低沉、轻柔，就像醇美的风琴声。不过她的嗓音中还带有蚂蚱声的粗糙，令人惬意地刺激着他的脊梁，把阵阵声波传至他脑际，产生激烈的震荡和冲击。的确是个惊人的发现——人的声音在一定的大气条件下（因为人必须讲究科学，科学是首要的）可以加速树木的生长！雷齐娅高兴地将她的手重重地放在他的膝上，以便把他压住、钉牢。榆树们兴奋地起伏着，所有枝叶都闪着光，颜色一会儿浅一会儿深，由蓝转为波谷的绿，如马头的鬃毛，似女士所戴的羽饰，它们那么自豪地波动着，那般绝美，还好被她的手压着，不然这些都会令他发狂的。然而他不会发狂。他将合上双眼，他不会再看什么。","“K... R...” said the nursemaid, and Septimus heard her say “Kay Arr” close to his ear, deeply, softly, like a mellow organ, but with a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper’s, which rasped his spine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound which, concussing, broke.A marvellous discovery indeed—that the human voice in certain atmospheric conditions (for one must be scientific, above all scientific) can quicken trees into life!Happily Rezia put her hand with a tremendous weight on his knee so that he was weighted down, transfixed, or the excitement of the elm trees rising and falling, rising and falling with all their leaves alight and the colour thinning and thickening from blue to the green of a hollow wave, like plumes on horses’ heads, feathers on ladies’, so proudly they rose and fell, so superbly, would have sent him mad.But he would not go mad.He would shut his eyes; he would see no more."
"然而它们在招手，树叶是有生命的，树也有生命。叶子通过数百万的纤维与他坐着的身躯相连，上下地扇动着他的身体，当枝条伸展开时，他也同样地表示回应。麻雀在错落有致的喷泉旁振动羽翼，飞起飞落，构成这图案的一部分，白和蓝的背景中，有黑色枝条形成的条纹。声音与冥想相融合，他们之间的间隔与声音一样耐人寻味。一个小孩哭了起来。远处适时吹起了号角。这一切合在一起表明一个新的宗教诞生了——","But they beckoned; leaves were alive; trees were alive.And the leaves being connected by millions of fibres with his own body, there on the seat, fanned it up and down; when the branch stretched he, too, made that statement.The sparrows fluttering, rising, and falling in jagged fountains were part of the pattern; the white and blue, barred with black branches.Sounds made harmonies with premeditation; the spaces between them were as significant as the sounds.A child cried.Rightly far away a horn sounded.All taken together meant the birth of a new religion—"
"“塞普蒂默斯！”雷齐娅喊着。他猛然惊起。人们一定注意到了。“我打算散步到喷泉那里后再返回。”她说道。","“Septimus!” said Rezia.He started violently.People must notice.“I am going to walk to the fountain and back,” she said."
"因为她再也忍不了了。霍姆斯医生可能会说这没什么要紧。她真宁愿他死去！她无法在他身边坐下。他的眼睛瞪那么大却没有看她。这使一切都很糟糕，天空、树木、游戏的孩子、吃力前行的车、吹哨、摔倒，一切都很糟糕。他不愿自杀，而她也不能向谁透露。“塞普蒂默斯工作一直都很辛苦。”——那就是所有她能告诉自己母亲的话。爱一个人使人寂寞，她想。她现在谁也不能透露，甚至是塞普蒂默斯也不行。她转过头，只见他穿着旧大衣，一个人坐在座位上，弯着背，盯着什么。一个男子汉说要自杀意味着怯懦。塞普蒂默斯曾战斗过，他是勇敢的。但他现在已不是以前的塞普蒂默斯了。她戴上了她的蕾丝领。她戴上了新帽子，而他从未留意过，没有她他感到高兴。可没有他任何事都无法让她开心！任何事都不行！他是自私的。男人都这样。他没病。霍姆斯医生说他没什么病。她把手伸在面前。瞧！她的婚戒滑落了——她变得这么瘦了。她忍受着痛苦——但她无人可诉。","For she could stand it no longer.Dr. Holmes might say there was nothing the matter.Far rather would she that he were dead!She could not sit beside him when he stared so and did not see her and made everything terrible; sky and tree, children playing, dragging carts, blowing whistles, falling down; all were terrible.And he would not kill himself; and she could tell no one.“Septimus has been working too hard”—that was all she could say to her own mother.To love makes one solitary, she thought.She could tell nobody, not even Septimus now, and looking back, she saw him sitting in his shabby overcoat alone, on the seat, hunched up, staring.And it was cowardly for a man to say he would kill himself, but Septimus had fought; he was brave; he was not Septimus now.She put on her lace collar.She put on her new hat and he never noticed; and he was happy without her.Nothing could make her happy without him!Nothing!He was selfish.So men are.For he was not ill.Dr. Holmes said there was nothing the matter with him.She spread her hand before her.Look! Her wedding ring slipped—she had grown so thin.It was she who suffered—but she had nobody to tell."
"在遥远的意大利，有些白色宅子，她的姐妹们坐在一间屋里制帽，街上每晚都拥挤着散步和嘻哈大笑的人，和这里半死不活的人一点也不像，他们在轮椅里缩成一团，盯着花盆中栽着的几朵丑陋的花！","Far was Italy and the white houses and the room where her sisters sat making hats, and the streets crowded every evening with people walking, laughing out loud, not half alive like people here, huddled up in Bath chairs, looking at a few ugly flowers stuck in pots!"
"“你应该去参观米兰的公园。”她高声说。不过让谁听啊？","“For you should see the Milan gardens,” she said aloud.But to whom?"
"这里没有人。她的声音在消逝。火箭的消逝也如此。它喷出火花冲向夜空，隐没在夜空中。暗夜来临，笼罩着房舍和塔楼的轮廓，荒凉的山丘柔和了，在夜色中隐没。可是尽管它们都不见了，夜依然蕴蓄着它们；色彩遭吞噬了，窗户看不见了，它们更凝重地存在着，传达出坦然的白昼无法传达的意境——漆黑的夜里，事物的烦扰和悬疑聚拢在一起，在暗夜里拥挤成一团；夜夺去了拂晓带来的慰藉，当晨晖把墙刷得灰白，照亮每扇窗玻璃，使田野的薄雾散去，露出安静地吃着草的棕红色的奶牛，这一切又装扮好了显现在眼前；又恢复了生机。我独自一人，我是孤独的！她哭喊着，站在摄政公园喷泉边（盯着那印度人和他的十字架），像是在午夜，所有的界线都消失了，国家还原成它远古的样子，就像罗马人着陆时看到的一样，万物朦胧模糊，山峦无名，河流迂回不知去向——这就是她心中的黑暗。一瞬间，似乎从哪里冒出一块暗礁，她站上去，说着她是怎样成为他的太太的，多年前与他在米兰结了婚，成了他的太太，她永远、永远不会告诉别人他疯了！她转过身，暗礁就倒下去了，她掉了下去，不住地下沉、下沉。因为他离开了，她思索着——离开了，和他扬言的一样，要去自杀——让自己死在一辆马车下！但没有。他在那里，依旧一个人在座位上坐着，穿着他的破大衣，交叉着腿，目不转睛，高声和自己说话。","There was nobody.Her words faded.So a rocket fades.Its sparks, having grazed their way into the night, surrender to it, dark descends, pours over the outlines of houses and towers; bleak hillsides soften and fall in.But though they are gone, the night is full of them; robbed of colour, blank of windows, they exist more ponderously, give out what the frank daylight fails to transmit—the trouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness; huddled together in the darkness; reft of the relief which dawn brings when, washing the walls white and grey, spotting each window pane, lifting the mist from the fields, showing the red-brown cows peacefully grazing, all is once more decked out to the eye; exists again.I am alone; I am alone!she cried, by the fountain in Regent’s Park (staring at the Indian and his cross), as perhaps at midnight, when all boundaries are lost, the country reverts to its ancient shape, as the Romans saw it, lying cloudy, when they landed, and the hills had no names and rivers wound they knew not where—such was her darkness; when suddenly, as if a shelf were shot forth and she stood on it, she said how she was his wife, married years ago in Milan, his wife, and would never, never tell that he was mad!Turning, the shelf fell; down, down she dropped.For he was gone, she thought—gone, as he threatened, to kill himself—to throw himself under a cart!But no; there he was; still sitting alone on the seat, in his shabby overcoat, his legs crossed, staring, talking aloud."
"人们不能砍伐树木。世间有上帝。（他在信封背面写下这类启示。）它改变了世界。人不能仇杀。让大家都知晓（他写下来了）。他在等。他在听。一只停歇在对面栏杆上的麻雀啁啾地叫着塞普蒂默斯，塞普蒂默斯，四五声后又拖长调子用希腊语唱起来，声音清脆刺耳，唱着世上怎样没有罪行，又有一只麻雀和它一起拉长尖声用希腊语唱着，怎样没有死亡，它们站在河对岸生命之草地的树丛中，那里有亡灵在行走。","Men must not cut down trees.There is a God.(He noted such revelations on the backs of envelopes.) Change the world.No one kills from hatred.Make it known (he wrote it down).He waited.He listened.A sparrow perched on the railing opposite chirped Septimus, Septimus, four or five times over and went on, drawing its notes out, to sing freshly and piercingly in Greek words how there is no crime and, joined by another sparrow, they sang in voices prolonged and piercing in Greek words, from trees in the meadow of life beyond a river where the dead walk, how there is no death."
"他的手在这里，亡灵在那里。白色的东西积聚在对面栏杆后面。可是他不敢瞧一瞧。埃文斯在那栏杆后面！","There was his hand; there the dead.White things were assembling behind the railings opposite.But he dared not look.Evans was behind the railings!"
"“你说什么呢？”雷齐娅坐在他旁边，忽然开口说话。又一次被打断！她老爱来打断。","“What are you saying?” said Rezia suddenly, sitting down by him.Interrupted again!She was always interrupting."
"远离人群——他们必须逃离人群，他说道（跳了起来），即刻就到那里，树下有些椅子，公园里一长段斜坡宛若一条绿缎带向下倾斜。蓝色和粉色的烟雾形成了高高的天蓬，遥远的、参差不齐的房屋在烟雾弥漫中形成一道壁垒，来往车辆在环形道上嗡嗡作响，在右边，深褐色动物将长脖颈伸出了公园栅栏，又吠又嚎。他们坐在那里的一棵树下。","Away from people—they must get away from people, he said (jumping up), right away over there, where there were chairs beneath a tree and the long slope of the park dipped like a length of green stuff with a ceiling cloth of blue and pink smoke high above, and there was a rampart of far irregular houses hazed in smoke, the traffic hummed in a circle, and on the right, dun-coloured animals stretched long necks over the Zoo palings, barking, howling.There they sat down under a tree."
"“看呀。”她乞求道，指向一群拿着板球门柱的男孩，有一个男孩把脚在地上滑来滑去，脚后跟立住打转，又在地上滑来滑去，好像他正在音乐厅演小丑。","“Look,” she implored him, pointing at a little troop of boys carrying cricket stumps, and one shuffled, spun round on his heel and shuffled, as if he were acting a clown at the music hall."
"“看呀。”她乞求道，因为霍姆斯医生告诉过她要使他关注实实在在的事，到音乐厅去，或打打板球——那是个很合适的游戏，霍姆斯医生说，是一个有益的户外游戏，他丈夫最适合了。","“Look,” she implored him, for Dr. Holmes had told her to make him notice real things, go to a music hall, play cricket—that was the very game, Dr. Holmes said, a nice out-of-door game, the very game for her husband."
"“看呀。”她又说道。","“Look,” she repeated."
"幽冥命令他看，那声音此刻就在与他对话，塞普蒂默斯，人类最伟大的一员，最近刚历经生死的考验，是来复兴社会的上帝，他像床单一样躺在那里，又如仅有阳光才能损毁的雪白毛毯，永远不会耗尽，永远受苦受难，如替罪羊，永恒的蒙难者。然而他不想这样，他呻吟着，挥挥手把永恒的苦难、永恒的寂寥撵走了。","Look the unseen bade him, the voice which now communicated with him who was the greatest of mankind, Septimus, lately taken from life to death, the Lord who had come to renew society, who lay like a coverlet, a snow blanket smitten only by the sun, for ever unwasted, suffering for ever, the scapegoat, the eternal sufferer, but he did not want it, he moaned, putting from him with a wave of his hand that eternal suffering, that eternal loneliness."
"“看呀。”她再次说，因为他在外面不应高声自语。","“Look,” she repeated, for he must not talk aloud to himself out of doors."
"“噢看呀。”她向他乞求。但那有什么好看的？有几头羊。就这些。","“Oh look,” she implored him.But what was there to look at?A few sheep.That was all."
"摄政公园地铁站怎么走——人们可以告知她去摄政公园地铁站的路吗——梅茜·约翰逊想知道。两天前她才从爱丁堡来到这里。","The way to Regent’s Park Tube station—could they tell her the way to Regent’s Park Tube station—Maisie Johnson wanted to know.She was only up from Edinburgh two days ago."
"“这路不对——往那里走！”雷齐娅大喊，挥手示意她到一边去，以防她遇见塞普蒂默斯。","“Not this way—over there!”Rezia exclaimed, waving her aside, lest she should see Septimus."
"这一对看来有些奇怪，梅茜·约翰逊心想。每件事都显得很奇怪。她初次来到伦敦，在莱登霍尔街她叔叔的店里工作，早晨她正走过摄政公园时，椅子上这对夫妇令她吃了一惊；那年轻女人看似外国人，男的显得怪异；所以就算她年纪很大了，她还是会记得这一幕，那时记忆里会浮现出五十年前某个明媚的夏季清晨她如何走过摄政公园的情形。因为她仅十九岁，最终如她所愿，来到伦敦。而现在多奇怪呀，她问路的这对夫妇，女人吃惊地猛一摆手，男人——他看来非常怪异；可能他俩在争吵；可能会永远地分离；她清楚一定有事发生；此刻所有这群人（由于她返回大路上了），这些石坛、这些整洁的花、这些上年纪的男人女人，他们中多数是轮椅上的病患——对于从爱丁堡来的她来说，看来都如此奇怪。梅茜·约翰逊加入了那缓慢跋涉、恍惚凝视、和风拂面的人群——松鼠栖息树上舔着身上的毛，麻雀在喷泉边扑闪着翅膀寻觅面包屑，几条狗忙于围着篱笆嬉戏。而暖融融的空气浸润着他们，令他们对生活固执冷漠的注视增添了些许怪诞与平和——梅茜·约翰逊非常肯定她需要大叫一声“噢”！（因为坐在椅子上那个年轻男人令她吃了一惊。什么事要发生了，她知道。）","Both seemed queer, Maisie Johnson thought.Everything seemed very queer.In London for the first time, come to take up a post at her uncle’s in Leadenhall Street, and now walking through Regent’s Park in the morning, this couple on the chairs gave her quite a turn; the young woman seeming foreign, the man looking queer; so that should she be very old she would still remember and make it jangle again among her memories how she had walked through Regent’s Park on a fine summer’s morning fifty years ago.For she was only nineteen and had got her way at last, to come to London; and now how queer it was, this couple she had asked the way of, and the girl started and jerked her hand, and the man—he seemed awfully odd; quarrelling, perhaps; parting for ever, perhaps; something was up, she knew; and now all these people (for she returned to the Broad Walk), the stone basins, the prim flowers, the old men and women, invalids most of them in Bath chairs—all seemed, after Edinburgh, so queer.And Maisie Johnson, as she joined that gently trudging, vaguely gazing, breeze-kissed company—squirrels perching and preening, sparrow fountains fluttering for crumbs, dogs busy with the railings, busy with each other, while the soft warm air washed over them and lent to the fixed unsurprised gaze with which they received life something whimsical and mollified—Maisie Johnson positively felt she must cry Oh!(for that young man on the seat had given her quite a turn.Something was up, she knew.)"
"恐怖！恐怖！她想大叫。（她离开亲人了，他们告诫过她会出什么事的。）","Horror! horror! she wanted to cry.(She had left her people; they had warned her what would happen.)"
"为什么她不呆在家呢？她大叫着，转动了铁栏杆上的球形捏手。那个女孩，登普斯特夫人想（她留下面包屑喂松鼠，还常在摄政公园吃午餐），仍然什么事都不明白。事实上，对她来说结实一些，动作放松一些，期待适度一些还好点。珀西爱喝酒。哦，最好生个男孩，登普斯特夫人这样想。她经历过艰难的日子，忍不住朝着那样的一位姑娘微笑。你会嫁人的，因为你很美，登普斯特夫人这样想着。嫁人，她想，到时你就知道了。噢，那些厨子，等等。每个男人都有着自己的习惯。要是我早能知道，是否会那样选择呢，登普斯特夫人想，她禁不住盼望和梅茜·约翰逊小声说句话；让她沧桑的老脸上起皱下垂的皮肤感觉到同情的一吻。因为生活是辛苦的，登普斯特夫人想着。她还有什么没付出的吗？红润的脸颊、身材和她的双脚。（她收拢了自己裙下粗肿的双腿。）","Why hadn’t she stayed at home? she cried, twisting the knob of the iron railing.That girl, thought Mrs. Dempster (who saved crusts for the squirrels and often ate her lunch in Regent’s Park), don’t know a thing yet; and really it seemed to her better to be a little stout, a little slack, a little moderate in one’s expectations.Percy drank.Well, better to have a son, thought Mrs. Dempster.She had had a hard time of it, and couldn’t help smiling at a girl like that.You’ll get married, for you’re pretty enough, thought Mrs. Dempster.Get married, she thought, and then you’ll know.Oh, the cooks, and so on.Every man has his ways.But whether I’d have chosen quite like that if I could have known, thought Mrs. Dempster, and could not help wishing to whisper a word to Maisie Johnson; to feel on the creased pouch of her worn old face the kiss of pity.For it’s been a hard life, thought Mrs. Dempster.What hadn’t she given to it?Roses; figure; her feet too.(She drew the knobbed lumps beneath her skirt.)"
"红润的脸颊，她讥讽地想道。尽胡说，我亲爱的。因为实际上，鉴于吃、喝、做爱、倒霉和走运的时日，生活有的不仅是玫瑰。此外，让我来告诉你，卡丽·登普斯特不愿与肯第史城的任何一个女人交换她的命运！然而，她乞求道，同情。同情，为了那逝去的红润面颊。她请求得到伫立在风信子花床边的梅茜·约翰逊的同情。","Roses, she thought sardonically.All trash, m’dear.For really, what with eating, drinking, and mating, the bad days and good, life had been no mere matter of roses, and what was more, let me tell you, Carrie Dempster had no wish to change her lot with any woman’s in Kentish Town!But, she implored, pity.Pity, for the loss of roses.Pity she asked of Maisie Johnson, standing by the hyacinth beds."
"啊，可瞧那飞机！登普斯特夫人不是总想看看外国风土吗？她有个侄儿，一个传教士。飞机疾速冲上云霄。她总是去马盖特出海，但始终让陆地出现在视野之内。可她没有耐心忍受怕水的女人。飞机掠过后就往下坠。她的心快要跳出来了。飞机又升起来了。飞机上有个好样的小伙子，登普斯特夫人保证。飞机疾速地越飞越远，慢慢消逝，越来越高，越过格林威治和所有桅杆，越过遍布灰色教堂的一小块区域，其中有圣保罗大教堂和其他教堂，越过伦敦两边。田野延伸开来，茶褐色森林里勇敢的画眉大胆跳跃着，迅速地一瞥，叼住一只蜗牛往石头上击打，一下、两下、三下。","Ah, but that aeroplane!Hadn’t Mrs. Dempster always longed to see foreign parts?She had a nephew, a missionary.It soared and shot.She always went on the sea at Margate, not out o’ sight of land, but she had no patience with women who were afraid of water.It swept and fell.Her stomach was in her mouth.Up again.There’s a fine young feller aboard of it, Mrs. Dempster wagered, and away and away it went, fast and fading, away and away the aeroplane shot; soaring over Greenwich and all the masts; over the little island of grey churches, St. Paul’s and the rest till, on either side of London, fields spread out and dark brown woods where adventurous thrushes hopping boldly, glancing quickly, snatched the snail and tapped him on a stone, once, twice, thrice."
"飞机越飞越远，直到只剩一个亮点。一种渴望，一种凝聚，一种人类灵魂的象征（本特利先生就是这样认为的，他正在格林威治精力旺盛地平整他的一块草皮），一种人类通过思维、爱因斯坦、推测、数学、孟德尔学说超越自身躯体、摆脱居所的决心的象征，本特利先生一边打扫着雪松周围，一边这样思索着——飞机越飞越远。","Away and away the aeroplane shot, till it was nothing but a bright spark; an aspiration; a concentration; a symbol (so it seemed to Mr. Bentley, vigorously rolling his strip of turf at Greenwich) of man’s soul; of his determination, thought Mr. Bentley, sweeping round the cedar tree, to get outside his body, beyond his house, by means of thought, Einstein, speculation, mathematics, the Mendelian theory—away the aeroplane shot."
"此后，一个衣衫破烂、莫名其妙的人拎着一只皮包站在圣保罗大教堂的台阶上，犹豫不决。因为不知道教堂里会有什么样的慰藉，多么热烈的欢迎，多少旗帜飘飘的坟墓，不是战胜敌人的军队的标志，而是战胜了那令人讨厌的寻找真理的精神的标志。他想这精神使我如今境遇堪忧。而且，大教堂提供志同道合的人，他想着，会邀你成为社团的一员。大人物是它的成员，殉道者为之献身。为什么不到里面去，他想着，随后把装满宣传单的皮包放在圣餐桌和十字架前，它象征着一种超越了寻求、探索和言语表达，完完全全成为精神的、脱离了躯体的、幽灵一样的东西——为什么不到里面去呢？他思索着，正当他犹豫之时，飞机出现在拉德盖特环形广场的上空。","Then, while a seedy-looking nondescript man carrying a leather bag stood on the steps of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and hesitated, for within was what balm, how great a welcome, how many tombs with banners waving over them, tokens of victories not over armies, but over, he thought, that plaguy spirit of truth seeking which leaves me at present without a situation, and more than that, the cathedral offers company, he thought, invites you to membership of a society; great men belong to it; martyrs have died for it; why not enter in, he thought, put this leather bag stuffed with pamphlets before an altar, a cross, the symbol of something which has soared beyond seeking and questing and knocking of words together and has become all spirit, disembodied, ghostly—why not enter in?he thought and while he hesitated out flew the aeroplane over Ludgate Circus."
"真是怪异，真是宁静。除了车辆就听不到其他声音了。看起来飞机好似无人驾驶，自由自在地飞翔。此刻，它转着弯越飞越高，青云直上，似乎出于欣喜若狂、纯粹出于喜悦而攀升，机尾冒出环状白烟，书写出字母T、O、F。","It was strange; it was still.Not a sound was to be heard above the traffic.Unguided it seemed; sped of its own free will.And now, curving up and up, straight up, like something mounting in ecstasy, in pure delight, out from behind poured white smoke looping, writing a T, an O, an F."
"“他们在看什么？”克拉丽莎·达洛维向开门的女佣问道。","“What are they looking at?” said Clarissa Dalloway to the maid who opened her door."
"这座宅子的门厅和地下室一样凉快。达洛维夫人将一只手举在眼前，女佣把门关上时，她听到露西裙子的窸窣声，她觉得自己好似与世隔绝的修女，裹着熟悉的修女的头巾，感觉到过去的虔诚得到了回应。厨师在厨房吹口哨。她听到打字机的咔哒声。这是她的生活。她在大厅的桌边埋着头，接受这影响力，感觉获得了祝福和净化。她拿起记有电话信息的便签本时，心中暗想，这种时刻真是生命之树上的花蕾，它们是黑夜之花（似乎有朵可爱的玫瑰只在她眼前绽放）。她一刻也没信仰过上帝。正因为这样，她更应该在日常生活中报答，她拿起便签本，心里想，在对待佣人，是的，对待狗和金丝雀，尤其是对待理查德——她的丈夫，他是生活的根本——那快乐的声音、绿灯光、甚至那吹哨的厨师，因为沃克夫人是爱尔兰人，所以整天吹哨——人必须用这私自贮存的美好时刻来报答，她思索着，一边擎着便签本。露西站在她身旁，试着解释什么。","The hall of the house was cool as a vault.Mrs. Dalloway raised her hand to her eyes, and, as the maid shut the door to, and she heard the swish of Lucy’s skirts, she felt like a nun who has left the world and feels fold round her the familiar veils and the response to old devotions.The cook whistled in the kitchen.She heard the click of the typewriter.It was her life, and, bending her head over the hall table, she bowed beneath the influence, felt blessed and purified, saying to herself, as she took the pad with the telephone message on it, how moments like this are buds on the tree of life, flowers of darkness they are, she thought (as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only); not for a moment did she believe in God; but all the more, she thought, taking up the pad, must one repay in daily life to servants, yes, to dogs and canaries, above all to Richard her husband, who was the foundation of it—of the gay sounds, of the green lights, of the cook even whistling, for Mrs. Walker was Irish and whistled all day long—one must pay back from this secret deposit of exquisite moments, she thought, lifting the pad, while Lucy stood by her, trying to explain how"
"“夫人，达洛维先生——”","“Mr. Dalloway, ma’am”—"
"克拉丽莎读着便签本上的电话留言：“布鲁顿女士想知晓达洛维先生今天能否与她一起吃午饭。”","Clarissa read on the telephone pad, “Lady Bruton wishes to know if Mr. Dalloway will lunch with her today.”"
"“夫人，达洛维先生让我跟您说他会在外面吃午餐。”","“Mr. Dalloway, ma’am, told me to tell you he would be lunching out.”"
"“天啊！”克拉丽莎说，露西如她所愿地感受到了她的沮丧（可并不是悲痛），感受到了她俩间的契合，领会了其间隐含之意，思考着名流们之间的爱情，镇定地为她的将来镀金。露西拿过达洛维夫人的阳伞，像是从战场上胜利归来的女神身上卸下神圣的武器，放在伞架上。","“Dear!” said Clarissa, and Lucy shared as she meant her to her disappointment (but not the pang); felt the concord between them; took the hint; thought how the gentry love; gilded her own future with calm; and, taking Mrs. Dalloway’s parasol, handled it like a sacred weapon which a Goddess, having acquitted herself honourably in the field of battle, sheds, and placed it in the umbrella stand."
"“不要再害怕了。”克拉丽莎说道。不用再怕骄阳的酷热。因为布鲁顿女士邀请理查德而没请她赴午餐，这使得她伫立的那一刻都颤抖了，像是河床上一株植物感受到了桨划过时的震动而随之颤抖。因而她震动，她颤抖。","“Fear no more,” said Clarissa.Fear no more the heat o’ the sun; for the shock of Lady Bruton asking Richard to lunch without her made the moment in which she had stood shiver, as a plant on the river-bed feels the shock of a passing oar and shivers: so she rocked: so she shivered."
"米莉森特·布鲁顿没邀请她，听说她的午宴会格外有意思。没什么俗气的妒忌可以将她与理查德分离。可她怕的是光阴本身，在布鲁顿女士脸上她读出了日渐萎缩的生命，就如无情的石头上刻着的日晷。而一年年过去了，她的生命是怎样被一点点切除，剩下的日子太少，不能再像青春岁月那般延伸，吸取生存的色彩、味道和音调。从前她走进一间房间时，她的存在会立刻充满整个房间。站在客厅门口迟疑的那一刻，她会感到非常不安，就像一个跳水运动员起跳前迟疑不决，海水在他身下忽明忽暗，浪涛似乎快要撞击开来，但只是温柔地拨开水面，用珍珠似的水花掀起水藻，翻滚着，随后把它们遮盖和淹没。","Millicent Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her.No vulgar jealousy could separate her from Richard.But she feared time itself, and read on Lady Bruton’s face, as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone, the dwindling of life; how year by year her share was sliced; how little the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching, of absorbing, as in the youthful years, the colours, salts, tones of existence, so that she filled the room she entered, and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing-room, an exquisite suspense, such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him, and the waves which threaten to break, but only gently split their surface, roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl."
"她将便签本放在了门厅的桌上。她开始缓慢地上楼，手扶着栏杆，仿佛刚参加完一个宴会，那里不时这个朋友、那个朋友令她回想起她的脸庞和声音。仿佛她关上门走出去一个人站着，独自面对这可怕的夜，或者更确切地说，面对这实实在在的六月早上的凝视。她知道这天早上对某些人来说如玫瑰花瓣的光辉一般柔和。当她驻足在打开的楼梯窗边时，她感觉到了这一点。窗外传来了百叶窗轻轻拍打声和狗叫声，传来了白昼的摩擦、锤炼和成熟的声音，她想着想着，便觉得自己瞬间变得枯萎、衰老、胸部干瘪，觉得自己已在门外、在窗外、超越了自己的身躯和此时衰竭的大脑，皆因布鲁顿女士没请她去据称那格外有意思的午宴。","She put the pad on the hall table.She began to go slowly upstairs, with her hand on the bannisters, as if she had left a party, where now this friend now that had flashed back her face, her voice; had shut the door and gone out and stood alone, a single figure against the appalling night, or rather, to be accurate, against the stare of this matter-of-fact June morning; soft with the glow of rose petals for some, she knew, and felt it, as she paused by the open staircase window which let in blinds flapping, dogs barking, let in, she thought, feeling herself suddenly shrivelled, aged, breastless, the grinding, blowing, flowering of the day, out of doors, out of the window, out of her body and brain which now failed, since Lady Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her."
"恰似一个修女归隐，或一个孩子在宝塔探险，她爬上楼，在窗边驻足片刻，走进洗手间。里面铺着绿色油毡，一只龙头滴着水。生活的中心一片空虚，阁楼上的一间屋子。女人必须卸去她们奢华的衣装。她们必须在中午时分退去衣装。她将针插入针垫，将插着羽毛的黄帽子置于床上。床单很整洁，像一条宽宽的白色带子紧紧地绷在床上。她的床将愈来愈窄。蜡烛的一半燃尽了，她曾经很投入地看马尔博男爵的《回忆录》。她在深夜读了莫斯科撤退的内容。由于议会的会议很长，理查德坚持她生病后睡眠一定不能受到打扰。她实际上更喜欢读莫斯科撤退的内容。他知道。所以她在阁楼上的房间里，一张狭小的床，她躺在那里看书，她睡眠不好，她无法驱散虽然生过孩子却仍存在的处女感，像床单一样紧紧地裹着她。少女时代的她很可爱，忽然某个瞬间——比方说在克利夫登森林下的河上——当时，由于这种冷漠性情，她让他失望了。然后在君士坦丁堡，又一次次发生这种事。她能够看到自己的缺陷。不是美丽，也不是头脑。而是某种渗透全身的非常重要的东西，某种温暖的、能冲破表层，使男女之间或女人之间淡漠的关系能够泛起涟漪的东西。对于这一点，她隐约可以觉察到。她憎恨它，对它有说不出的不安，天知道这不安是从哪里来的，或者，像她感觉的那样，是大自然赋予的（大自然向来是充满智慧的）。但有时她抵抗不住女人的吸引力，不是指一个女孩，而是一个忏悔自己的窘况或者愚蠢行为的女人，她们常这样做。是否是因怜悯，或她们的美丽，或她更年长，或某种巧合——比如一股幽幽的香气，或邻屋的小提琴声（有些时候声音的力量是多么地奇特），她的确感受到了男人的感受。仅仅一瞬间的感受，不过这就够了。这是一个突如其来的启示，恰似脸红的滋味，你设法制止，它却蔓延开来，你也只好任其扩展，匆匆跑向最远的角落，在那里颤抖着，感到世界在紧逼，充满了一种令人吃惊的涵义、一种对极度欢喜的压抑，它冲破了薄薄的表皮倾泻出来，极大地缓解了裂口和疼痛。于是，在那个时刻，她看到了光明。一根火柴在一朵番红花里燃烧。一种内在的含义近乎得到了表达。　可是亲近的撤退了，坚硬的软化了。那一刻——结束了。与这些时刻（包括和女人在一起的时刻）相呼应的是（她脱下帽子）那张床、马尔博男爵的书和燃了半截的蜡烛。她醒着躺在床上，地板嘎吱作响。亮着灯的房间忽然变黑了，要是她抬头，便能隐约听到理查德尽可能温柔地松开门把手时发出的咔哒声，他只穿着袜子溜上了楼，然后却常常把热水袋掉到地上，便咒骂着！她笑死了！","Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went upstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom.There was the green linoleum and a tap dripping.There was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room.Women must put off their rich apparel.At midday they must disrobe.She pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow hat on the bed.The sheets were clean, tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side.Narrower and narrower would her bed be.The candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in Baron Marbot’s Memoirs.She had read late at night of the retreat from Moscow.For the House sat so long that Richard insisted, after her illness, that she must sleep undisturbed.And really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow.He knew it.So the room was an attic; the bed narrow; and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet.Lovely in girlhood, suddenly there came a moment—for example on the river beneath the woods at Clieveden—when, through some contraction of this cold spirit, she had failed him.And then at Constantinople, and again and again.She could see what she lacked.It was not beauty; it was not mind.It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.For THAT she could dimly perceive.She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows where, or, as she felt, sent by Nature (who is invariably wise); yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman, not a girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape, some folly.And whether it was pity, or their beauty, or that she was older, or some accident—like a faint scent, or a violin next door (so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments), she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt.Only for a moment; but it was enough.It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores!Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed.But the close withdrew; the hard softened.It was over—the moment.Against such moments (with women too) there contrasted (as she laid her hat down) the bed and Baron Marbot and the candle half-burnt.Lying awake, the floor creaked; the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her head she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his socks and then, as often as not, dropped his hot-water bottle and swore!How she laughed!"
"不过这个爱情问题（她思索着，一边放好了她的大衣），爱上女人的问题。以萨莉·西顿为例，过去她与萨莉·西顿的关系。不管怎样，莫非那不就是爱情吗？","But this question of love (she thought, putting her coat away), this falling in love with women.Take Sally Seton; her relation in the old days with Sally Seton.Had not that, after all, been love?"
"萨莉在地板上坐着——她对萨莉的第一印象就是那样——她双手抱膝坐在地板上，抽着烟。那可能是在什么地方？是曼宁家吗？还是金洛克·琼斯家？是在某次宴会上（在哪里她不能确定），因为她清晰地记得问与她一起的男人：“那是谁？”他告诉了她，又说萨莉的父母之间有些隔阂（那是怎样使她震惊啊——一个人的父母居然要争吵）。可一整晚她的视线都无法从萨莉身上移开。这是她最喜欢的那种非凡的美，黑皮肤，大眼睛，还有她无拘无束的个性，似乎她什么都敢说，什么都敢做。这一点在外国女人身上要比在英国女人身上要普遍得多，由于她自己没有这个特点，因此非常羡慕萨莉。萨莉老是说她有着法国血统，祖上曾有人是玛丽·安托瓦妮特的侍者，他被砍了头，传下一只红宝石戒指。或许就是那个夏天萨莉来伯顿小住过一段时间。有一天晚饭后她出人意料地走了进来，口袋里没有一分钱，可怜的海伦娜姑妈非常烦乱，以至于一直都没有原谅她。萨莉家发生了一场争吵。她来她们家的那晚真的没有一分钱——还是当了一枚胸针才有了路费。她是一气之下冲出门的。她们彻夜未眠地聊。就是萨莉第一次使她感觉到伯顿的生活是多么地未经风雨。她根本不知道什么是性——什么是社会问题。她曾有一回看到一个老人倒在田野里死了——她曾见到刚产下小牛犊的母牛。可海伦娜姑妈从不喜欢谈论任何事情（萨莉把威廉·莫里斯的书给她时，不得不用牛皮纸包起来）。她和萨莉坐在顶楼上她的卧房里，一小时又一小时地聊着，聊生活，聊她俩打算怎样改造世界。她俩计划创办一个废除私有财产的社团，确实也写过一封信，尽管并未寄出。当然，这些都是萨莉的主意——可是不久，她就像萨莉那样兴奋——早饭前在床上读柏拉图，读莫里斯。一个小时接着一个小时地读雪莱。","She sat on the floor—that was her first impression of Sally—she sat on the floor with her arms round her knees, smoking a cigarette.Where could it have been?The Mannings?The Kinloch-Jones’s?At some party (where, she could not be certain), for she had a distinct recollection of saying to the man she was with, “Who is THAT?”And he had told her, and said that Sally’s parents did not get on (how that shocked her—that one’s parents should quarrel!).But all that evening she could not take her eyes off Sally.It was an extraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired, dark, large-eyed, with that quality which, since she hadn’t got it herself, she always envied—a sort of abandonment, as if she could say anything, do anything; a quality much commoner in foreigners than in English women.Sally always said she had French blood in her veins, an ancestor had been with Marie Antoinette, had his head cut off, left a ruby ring.Perhaps that summer she came to stay at Bourton, walking in quite unexpectedly without a penny in her pocket, one night after dinner, and upsetting poor Aunt Helena to such an extent that she never forgave her.There had been some quarrel at home.She literally hadn’t a penny that night when she came to them—had pawned a brooch to come down.She had rushed off in a passion.They sat up till all hours of the night talking.Sally it was who made her feel, for the first time, how sheltered the life at Bourton was.She knew nothing about sex—nothing about social problems.She had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field—she had seen cows just after their calves were born.But Aunt Helena never liked discussion of anything (when Sally gave her William Morris, it had to be wrapped in brown paper).There they sat, hour after hour, talking in her bedroom at the top of the house, talking about life, how they were to reform the world.They meant to found a society to abolish private property, and actually had a letter written, though not sent out.The ideas were Sally’s, of course—but very soon she was just as excited—read Plato in bed before breakfast; read Morris; read Shelley by the hour."
"萨莉的力量令人惊奇，她的天赋，她的个性。例如，她摆放花的习惯。在伯顿，人们老是把呆板的小花瓶在桌子上摆成一排。萨莉外出了，采下蜀葵、大丽花——各类从未见人们放在一起的花——她剪下花朵，让它们浮在碗中的水面上。在日落时分回来吃饭时见到——那效果非比寻常。（当然，海伦娜姑妈认为如此对待花是邪恶的。）还有她忘了拿海绵，就光着身子跑过走廊。那个冷酷的老女仆，埃伦·阿特金斯，到处嘟囔：“假如哪位绅士看到了如何是好？”她的确令人震惊。她不爱干净，父亲说。","Sally’s power was amazing, her gift, her personality.There was her way with flowers, for instance.At Bourton they always had stiff little vases all the way down the table.Sally went out, picked hollyhocks, dahlias—all sorts of flowers that had never been seen together—cut their heads off, and made them swim on the top of water in bowls.The effect was extraordinary—coming in to dinner in the sunset.(Of course Aunt Helena thought it wicked to treat flowers like that.) Then she forgot her sponge, and ran along the passage naked.That grim old housemaid, Ellen Atkins, went about grumbling—“Suppose any of the gentlemen had seen?”Indeed she did shock people.She was untidy, Papa said."
"回顾起来，不可思议的是她对萨莉情感上的纯净和真挚。和对男人的感情不同。它是全然没有私心的，而且，它有一种只能存在于女人之间，存在于刚成年的女人之间的特性。就她而言，这是保护性的情感，来自一种联盟之感，一种她俩必定会被某种东西分离的预感（她俩说起婚姻时，老是把它看作灾难），这就促成了这种骑士精神，和这种保护性的情感，这方面在她身上要比萨莉身上强得多。因为那时萨莉完全不计后果，为了逞能会做出最愚蠢的事情。比如围着露台矮墙蹬自行车，抽雪茄。她真是荒唐——非常荒唐。不过这种吸引力是无法抵抗的，至少对她而言是这样。所以她能记得自己站在顶楼卧房里，手拿暖水瓶高喊：“她就在这个屋子里……她就在这个屋子里！”如今，这些话对她已经完全没有任何意义。对昔日的旧情，她甚至一点反响都找不到了。不过她仍然记得曾兴奋得发冷，带着狂喜梳头发（如今她取出发卡搁在梳妆台上，开始梳头发时，昔日的情感又涌上心头）。白嘴鸭得意地在粉红色的夜幕下飞起飞落。她梳妆完毕，走下楼来，她走过大厅时觉得：“要是现在死去，此刻即是最幸福的。”那即是她的感受——奥赛罗的感受，她感觉到了这一点，她深信自己感觉到的与莎士比亚想让奥赛罗感觉到的一样强烈，这些皆因她身着白色上衣下楼吃饭，去与萨莉·西顿相见！","The strange thing, on looking back, was the purity, the integrity, of her feeling for Sally.It was not like one’s feeling for a man.It was completely disinterested, and besides, it had a quality which could only exist between women, between women just grown up.It was protective, on her side; sprang from a sense of being in league together, a presentiment of something that was bound to part them (they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe), which led to this chivalry, this protective feeling which was much more on her side than Sally’s.For in those days she was completely reckless; did the most idiotic things out of bravado; bicycled round the parapet on the terrace; smoked cigars.Absurd, she was—very absurd.But the charm was overpowering, to her at least, so that she could remember standing in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot-water can in her hands and saying aloud, “She is beneath this roof....She is beneath this roof!”No, the words meant absolutely nothing to her now.She could not even get an echo of her old emotion.But she could remember going cold with excitement, and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy (now the old feeling began to come back to her, as she took out her hairpins, laid them on the dressin table, began to do her hair), with the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light, and dressing, and going downstairs, and feeling as she crossed the hall “if it were now to die ‘twere now to be most happy.”That was her feeling—Othello’s feeling, and she felt it, she was convinced, as strongly as Shakespeare meant Othello to feel it, all because she was coming down to dinner in a white frock to meet Sally Seton!"
"萨莉身着粉红薄纱衣——那可能吗？无论如何，她似乎全身闪耀着光芒，宛如飞进来的一只鸟或气球，在荆棘丛里呆上一会儿。可是人在爱情中时（这不是爱情又是什么），最奇怪的莫过于对其他人的冷漠。海伦娜姑妈吃完晚饭后就出去散步了，父亲读着报纸。彼得·沃尔什或许在那里，上了年纪的卡明斯小姐兴许也在，约瑟夫·布赖特科普夫一定在场，因为每年夏天他都来住上几周，可怜的老人，他装作与她一同朗读德文，但实际上是来弹钢琴，蹩脚地哼唱勃拉姆斯的曲子。","She was wearing pink gauze—was that possible?She SEEMED, anyhow, all light, glowing, like some bird or air ball that has flown in, attached itself for a moment to a bramble.But nothing is so strange when one is in love (and what was this except being in love?) as the complete indifference of other people.Aunt Helena just wandered off after dinner; Papa read the paper.Peter Walsh might have been there, and old Miss Cummings; Joseph Breitkopf certainly was, for he came every summer, poor old man, for weeks and weeks, and pretended to read German with her, but really played the piano and sang Brahms without any voice."
"这一切仅仅是为了陪衬萨莉。她站在火炉边与克拉丽莎的父亲谈话。她那美妙的声音使她谈论的每件事听来如爱抚一般。父亲也禁不住开始被她吸引。他曾借了自己的一本书给她，结果发现它被浸湿在露台上，这事他一直无法释怀。她忽然说道：“呆在屋里多可惜啊！”然后他们都走到外面的露台上，走来走去。彼得·沃尔什与约瑟夫·布赖特科普夫接着谈论瓦格纳。她和萨莉走在后面一点。她们经过一只插着花的石瓮，此时，她一生中最美妙的时刻来到了。萨莉驻足，摘下一株花，亲了亲她的嘴唇。真是天摇地晃！别人都消失了，唯有她和萨莉呆在那里。她觉得自己像是得到了一件包好的礼物，让她保存好，不能看——一颗钻石，无价之宝，包得好好的，在她俩散步时（来来回回，来来回回），她拆开包装，也许是钻石的光芒透射出来，是神启，是笃真的情感！此刻，老约瑟夫与彼得走到她俩跟前。","All this was only a background for Sally.She stood by the fireplace talking, in that beautiful voice which made everything she said sound like a caress, to Papa, who had begun to be attracted rather against his will (he never got over lending her one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace), when suddenly she said, “What a shame to sit indoors!” and they all went out on to the terrace and walked up and down.Peter Walsh and Joseph Breitkopf went on about Wagner.She and Sally fell a little behind.Then came the most exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with flowers in it.Sally stopped; picked a flower; kissed her on the lips.The whole world might have turned upside down!The others disappeared; there she was alone with Sally.And she felt that she had been given a present, wrapped up, and told just to keep it, not to look at it—a diamond, something infinitely precious, wrapped up, which, as they walked (up and down, up and down), she uncovered, or the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling!—when old Joseph and Peter faced them:"
"“呆呆地想什么呢？”彼得说。","“Star-gazing?” said Peter."
"像是脸在黑夜中撞到了花岗岩墙上！太讨厌了！太恐怖了！","It was like running one’s face against a granite wall in the darkness!It was shocking; it was horrible!"
"并非为自己而想。她只是感觉到了萨莉已经受到了粗暴地对待。她感受到了他的敌意，他的嫉妒，他想要插手她俩交情的决心。她看到了这一切，如同有人在闪电的一瞬看见了眼前的风景——而萨莉（她从未如此强烈地爱慕她！）毫不气馁，勇敢地一意孤行。她笑着。她要老约瑟夫告诉她那些星星的名字，这是他喜欢认真去做的事。她站在那里，听着。她听到了那些星星的名字。","Not for herself.She felt only how Sally was being mauled already, maltreated; she felt his hostility; his jealousy; his determination to break into their companionship.All this she saw as one sees a landscape in a flash of lightning—and Sally (never had she admired her so much!) gallantly taking her way unvanquished.She laughed.She made old Joseph tell her the names of the stars, which he liked doing very seriously.She stood there: she listened.She heard the names of the stars."
"“噢，真可怕！”她自言自语，好像她一直就清楚有什么事会来扰乱，会来毁坏她幸福的一刻。","“Oh this horror!” she said to herself, as if she had known all along that something would interrupt, would embitter her moment of happiness."
"但是，毕竟后来她欠了彼得很多情啊。不知为何，她一想起他，总是想起他俩的争吵——大概是因为她太需要他的好评了。他用这些词来评价她：“感伤”、“文明”。她生活的每一天都是以这两个词开始，似乎他在保护着她。一本书是感伤的，一种生活态度是感伤的。也许她老是回想过去也是“感伤的”。她想知道，他回来时他会想什么？","Yet, after all, how much she owed to him later.Always when she thought of him she thought of their quarrels for some reason—because she wanted his good opinion so much, perhaps.She owed him words: “sentimental,” “civilised”; they started up every day of her life as if he guarded her.A book was sentimental; an attitude to life sentimental.“Sentimental,” perhaps she was to be thinking of the past.What would he think, she wondered, when he came back?"
"想她老了吗？他回来了会那样说吗？或者她会觉察到他认为她老了？这是事实。自从患病之后，她的头发近乎全白了。","That she had grown older?Would he say that, or would she see him thinking when he came back, that she had grown older?It was true.Since her illness she had turned almost white."
"她将胸针搁于桌上，忽然间觉得一阵战栗，似乎她冥想时，冷冰冰的爪子已经乘机在她的身上安顿下来。她尚未老去。她刚迈入第五十二个年头。还有好多好多个月要度过呢。六月、七月、八月！每个月仍几乎是完完整整的，而且，似乎为了抓住消逝的一点一滴，克拉丽莎（向梳妆台走去）陷入这一刻的核心里，定在那里——这六月早上的一刻，其他所有早上的压力都聚拢在这里，她重新注视着镜子、梳妆台，和所有瓶子，这些把她全身都聚拢在一点（她照镜子时），只见那晚举办晚宴的女子娇嫩粉红的面庞，是克拉丽莎·达洛维的面庞，她自己的面庞。","Laying her brooch on the table, she had a sudden spasm, as if, while she mused, the icy claws had had the chance to fix in her.She was not old yet.She had just broken into her fifty-second year.Months and months of it were still untouched.June, July, August!Each still remained almost whole, and, as if to catch the falling drop, Clarissa (crossing to the dressing table) plunged into the very heart of the moment, transfixed it, there—the moment of this June morning on which was the pressure of all the other mornings, seeing the glass, the dressing-table, and all the bottles afresh, collecting the whole of her at one point (as she looked into the glass), seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was that very night to give a party; of Clarissa Dalloway; of herself."
"她曾数百万次看到自己的面庞，总是露出不变的难以察觉的收缩！她照镜子时嘟着嘴。让她的脸显得尖些。那就是她自己——尖脸，梭镖似的，确定无疑。那就是她自己，当某种努力、某种让她做自己的召唤将她全身各处聚拢到一点时，唯独她自己知晓这多么不同，多么不一致。只是为了这外部世界才把自己构成一个中心，一颗钻石、一个坐在自己客厅里为大家提供聚会场所的女人。无疑为一些生活枯燥的人带来一点光亮，或许是孤独之人的避风港。她帮助过青年，他们都感激她。她曾试着始终如一，永不显露她所有其他方面的迹象——过错、嫉妒、虚荣、怀疑，就如对于布鲁顿女士没邀请她赴午宴这件事，她想（终于梳头发了），真是极端卑劣的！　哎，她的礼服在哪里呢？","How many million times she had seen her face, and always with the same imperceptible contraction!She pursed her lips when she looked in the glass.It was to give her face point.That was her self—pointed; dartlike; definite.That was her self when some effort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together, she alone knew how different, how incompatible and composed so for the world only into one centre, one diamond, one woman who sat in her drawing-room and made a meeting-point, a radiancy no doubt in some dull lives, a refuge for the lonely to come to, perhaps; she had helped young people, who were grateful to her; had tried to be the same always, never showing a sign of all the other sides of her—faults, jealousies, vanities, suspicions, like this of Lady Bruton not asking her to lunch; which, she thought (combing her hair finally), is utterly base!Now, where was her dress?"
"她的晚礼服挂在衣柜中。克拉丽莎将手插入柔软的衣服里，温柔地取下绿色礼服，把它拿到窗边。她把礼服扯坏了。有人踩到裙子上了。在使馆宴会上，她感觉到裙围顶部褶皱处裂开了。绿色在人造灯下闪闪发光，可如今在阳光下便失去了色彩。她会缝补好它。她的女仆们要做的事够多了。她会在今晚穿上它。她会带上她的丝绒、她的剪刀、还有她的——什么来着？当然，她的顶针，到楼下客厅去，因为她还得写信，还要照看好一切，使得所有事情都大致上准备妥当。","Her evening dresses hung in the cupboard.Clarissa, plunging her hand into the softness, gently detached the green dress and carried it to the window.She had torn it.Some one had trod on the skirt.She had felt it give at the Embassy party at the top among the folds.By artificial light the green shone, but lost its colour now in the sun.She would mend it.Her maids had too much to do.She would wear it tonight.She would take her silks, her scissors, her—what was it?—her thimble, of course, down into the drawing-room, for she must also write, and see that things generally were more or less in order."
"真怪，她想着，一边在楼梯平台停下来。把自己组成那个钻石形状的、独自的一个人，真怪，一个女主人对自己家中的那重大时刻、那特性有如此的了解！微弱的声音沿着楼梯井扶摇直上，是拖把的窸窣声、轻敲声、碰撞声、前门打开时的响声、地下室里一个在重复什么消息的声音、盘子上银器的叮当声，为宴会备好的洁净的银器。全是为了这次宴会。","Strange, she thought, pausing on the landing, and assembling that diamond shape, that single person, strange how a mistress knows the very moment, the very temper of her house!Faint sounds rose in spirals up the well of the stairs; the swish of a mop; tapping; knocking; a loudness when the front door opened; a voice repeating a message in the basement; the chink of silver on a tray; clean silver for the party.All was for the party."
"（而露西托着盘子来到客厅，把巨型烛台放到壁炉架上，银制首饰盒摆在正中，将水晶海豚转向挂钟。　他们会来的，他们会在站在这里，他们会装腔作势地聊天，她也可以模仿那样说话，那些女士先生们。所有人中，她的女主人最可爱了——她是银器、亚麻织物、瓷器的女主人，因为这阳光、银器、脱下合叶的门、昂伯尔梅尔派来的人全部给她一种成就了什么的感觉。此刻，她把裁纸剪刀放到了有镶蚀的桌子上。瞧！瞧！","(And Lucy, coming into the drawing-room with her tray held out, put the giant candlesticks on the mantelpiece, the silver casket in the middle, turned the crystal dolphin towards the clock.They would come; they would stand; they would talk in the mincing tones which she could imitate, ladies and gentlemen.Of all, her mistress was loveliest—mistress of silver, of linen, of china, for the sun, the silver, doors off their hinges, Rumpelmayer’s men, gave her a sense, as she laid the paper-knife on the inlaid table, of something achieved.Behold! Behold!"
"她对面包店里的老朋友们说道，同时窥探玻璃窗，这是她初次在凯特勒姆店做事。她是安杰拉太太，是伺候玛丽公主的。这时，达洛维夫人走了进来。）","she said, speaking to her old friends in the baker’s shop, where she had first seen service at Caterham, prying into the glass.She was Lady Angela, attending Princess Mary, when in came Mrs. Dalloway.)"
"“噢，露西，”她说道，“银器看起来的确很美！”","“Oh Lucy,” she said, “the silver does look nice!”"
"“你觉得，”她说着，一边旋转水晶海豚让其竖立，“昨晚的戏怎么样？”“啊，演出结束前他们就得走！”她说道。“他们必须十点回去！”她说道。“因此他们不清楚发生了什么。”她答道。“那真不走运。”她说道（只要她的仆人们提出来，他们就可以再呆一会儿）。“那真是非常遗憾。”她如是说，拿起沙发中间的一块光秃秃的旧靠枕，塞到露西怀里，轻轻地推了一下她，大声说道，","“And how,” she said, turning the crystal dolphin to stand straight, “how did you enjoy the play last night?”“Oh, they had to go before the end!” she said.“They had to be back at ten!” she said.“So they don’t know what happened,” she said.“That does seem hard luck,” she said (for her servants stayed later, if they asked her).“That does seem rather a shame,” she said, taking the old bald-looking cushion in the middle of the sofa and putting it in Lucy’s arms, and giving her a little push, and crying:"
"“把它拿去！送给沃克夫人并代我问好！把它拿去！”她大声说道。","“Take it away!Give it to Mrs. Walker with my compliments!Take it away!” she cried."
"露西拿着靠枕，在客厅门口停住了，脸微微泛红，十分害羞地问她能否帮忙修补那身礼服？","And Lucy stopped at the drawing-room door, holding the cushion, and said, very shyly, turning a little pink, Couldn’t she help to mend that dress?"
"但是，达洛维夫人说露西自己已有足够的活儿要做，不缝补礼服也够她忙活的了。","But, said Mrs. Dalloway, she had enough on her hands already, quite enough of her own to do without that."
"“但是，谢谢你，露西，噢，谢谢你。”达洛维夫人说，谢谢你，谢谢你，她不停地说着（她坐在沙发上，膝盖上放着礼服、剪刀、丝绸），谢谢你，谢谢你，她继续说着，感激她的仆人们帮她成为现在的她，成为她想要的那样——温柔、宽宏大量。她的仆人们都喜欢她。她的礼服——哪个地方扯坏了？这时要穿针引线了。这是她最喜爱的一件礼服，萨莉·帕克缝制的，差不多是她做的最后一件了。哎，因为萨莉现已退休，在伊灵住，如果我有一刻空闲，克拉丽莎想着（可她再也不会有一刻空闲），我会去伊灵看望她。因为她有个性，克拉丽莎想着，是个真正的艺术家。她想起了萨莉一些古怪的事情，然而她做的衣服从来都不古怪。你能在哈特菲尔德穿这些衣服，在白金汉宫穿也行。她在哈特菲尔德穿过，在白金汉宫也穿过。","“But, thank you, Lucy, oh, thank you,” said Mrs. Dalloway, and thank you, thank you, she went on saying (sitting down on the sofa with her dress over her knees, her scissors, her silks), thank you, thank you, she went on saying in gratitude to her servants generally for helping her to be like this, to be what she wanted, gentle, generous-hearted.Her servants liked her.And then this dress of hers—where was the tear?and now her needle to be threaded.This was a favourite dress, one of Sally Parker’s, the last almost she ever made, alas, for Sally had now retired, living at Ealing, and if ever I have a moment, thought Clarissa (but never would she have a moment any more), I shall go and see her at Ealing.For she was a character, thought Clarissa, a real artist.She thought of little out-of-the-way things; yet her dresses were never queer.You could wear them at Hatfield; at Buckingham Palace.She had worn them at Hatfield; at Buckingham Palace."
"静谧侵袭了她全身，她觉得宁静、满足，手中的针把丝线一针一针地平稳地拉到头，把散开的绿色褶边叠好，轻轻地缝在裙腰上。就如夏日里波浪聚拢、失衡、散落，聚拢来又散落。全世界似乎都在说“就是这样”，那声音越来越沉重，直到连海滩上晒太阳的人也在内心说，就是这样。不用再害怕，那颗心说。不用再害怕，那颗心说，把包袱托付给大海吧，它为所有悲伤叹息，随即复苏、开始、聚拢、任其散落。唯有身躯聆听着飞舞的蜜蜂在鸣唱，波浪在拍打，狗在叫，在遥远的地方不停地叫着。","Quiet descended on her, calm, content, as her needle, drawing the silk smoothly to its gentle pause, collected the green folds together and attached them, very lightly, to the belt.So on a summer’s day waves collect, overbalance, and fall; collect and fall; and the whole world seems to be saying “that is all” more and more ponderously, until even the heart in the body which lies in the sun on the beach says too, That is all.Fear no more, says the heart.Fear no more, says the heart, committing its burden to some sea, which sighs collectively for all sorrows, and renews, begins, collects, lets fall.And the body alone listens to the passing bee; the wave breaking; the dog barking, far away barking and barking."
"“天啊，前门响起了门铃声！”克拉丽莎大声说，停下了手中的针。她被唤醒了，留心听着。","“Heavens, the front-door bell!” exclaimed Clarissa, staying her needle.Roused, she listened."
"“达洛维夫人要见我。”大厅里一名年长的男子说。“噢，是的，她要见我。”他反复说着，十分友善地把露西推到一边，非常迅速地跑上了楼。“是的，是的，是的。”他一边跑一边咕哝着。“她要见我。我在印度呆了五年了，克拉丽莎要见我。”","“Mrs. Dalloway will see me,” said the elderly man in the hall.“Oh yes, she will see ME,” he repeated, putting Lucy aside very benevolently, and running upstairs ever so quickly.“Yes, yes, yes,” he muttered as he ran upstairs.“She will see me.After five years in India, Clarissa will see me.”"
"“会是谁呢？来干什么？”达洛维夫人自言自语道（她觉得这真令人无法容忍，在她举办宴会那天早上十一点，居然会被打扰），她听到了楼梯上的脚步声。她听到有人把手放到门上。她准备要藏起礼服，宛若一位处女维护贞洁，注重隐私。现在铜把手在扭动。这时门开了，走进来一个人——一瞬间她记不得他叫什么名字！看到他时她是多么惊讶、多么欢欣、多么腼腆，彼得·沃尔什早上意外的到来使她完全惊呆了！（她没看他写的信。）","“Who can—what can,” asked Mrs. Dalloway (thinking it was outrageous to be interrupted at eleven o’clock on the morning of the day she was giving a party), hearing a step on the stairs.She heard a hand upon the door.She made to hide her dress, like a virgin protecting chastity, respecting privacy.Now the brass knob slipped.Now the door opened, and in came—for a single second she could not remember what he was called!so surprised she was to see him, so glad, so shy, so utterly taken aback to have Peter Walsh come to her unexpectedly in the morning!(She had not read his letter.)"
"“你过得怎么样？”彼得·沃尔什颤抖地说道，真的在颤抖。他握住她的双手，亲吻她的双手。她变老了些，他想，一边坐了下来。我不应给她讲这个的，他思索着，因为她变老了。她正在看我，他想着，这使他感到一阵突如其来的尴尬，虽然他已经亲吻过她的手。他把一只手伸向袋中，取出一把大折刀，打开了一半。","“And how are you?” said Peter Walsh, positively trembling; taking both her hands; kissing both her hands.She’s grown older, he thought, sitting down.I shan’t tell her anything about it, he thought, for she’s grown older.She’s looking at me, he thought, a sudden embarrassment coming over him, though he had kissed her hands.Putting his hand into his pocket, he took out a large pocket-knife and half opened the blade."
"他和以前一样，克拉丽莎想着。一样的怪异表情，一样的格子套装，脸似乎有点歪，还有点干瘦，可看起来气色很好，完全没变。","Exactly the same, thought Clarissa; the same queer look; the same check suit; a little out of the straight his face is, a little thinner, dryer, perhaps, but he looks awfully well, and just the same."
"“再次看到你真是太好了！”她大声说道。他拿出折刀。他就是这样，她想。","“How heavenly it is to see you again!” she exclaimed.He had his knife out.That’s so like him, she thought."
"他昨晚刚进城，他说道。立刻就得到乡下去。一切都好吗？每个人都好吗？理查德好吗？伊丽莎白好吗？“这些是什么？”他说着，用小刀斜着指向她的绿色礼服。","He had only reached town last night, he said; would have to go down into the country at once; and how was everything, how was everybody—Richard? Elizabeth?“And what’s all this?” he said, tilting his pen-knife towards her green dress."
"他穿戴很讲究，克拉丽莎想，但是他老是批评我。","He’s very well dressed, thought Clarissa; yet he always criticises ME."
"她正在这里补礼服，像平时一样补礼服，他想。我在印度时，她就坐在这里缝补她的礼服，到处闲逛，参加宴会，跑去议会又回来等诸如此类。他想着，越发急躁，越发不安，因为对某些女子来说，世上没什么比婚姻更糟糕的了。还有政治，有一个保守党人做丈夫，比如那令人欣赏的理查德。就是这样，就是这样，他想，啪地一声合上了刀。","Here she is mending her dress; mending her dress as usual, he thought; here she’s been sitting all the time I’ve been in India; mending her dress; playing about; going to parties; running to the House and back and all that, he thought, growing more and more irritated, more and more agitated, for there’s nothing in the world so bad for some women as marriage, he thought; and politics; and having a Conservative husband, like the admirable Richard.So it is, so it is, he thought, shutting his knife with a snap."
"“理查德很好。理查德在委员会有事。”克拉丽莎说道。","“Richard’s very well.Richard’s at a Committee,” said Clarissa."
"她打开剪刀，问他介不介意她缝完她的礼服，因为晚上有个聚会。","And she opened her scissors, and said, did he mind her just finishing what she was doing to her dress, for they had a party that night?"
"“我没想要请你去。”她说道。“我亲爱的彼得！”她说道。","“Which I shan’t ask you to,” she said.“My dear Peter!” she said."
"不过听她那么称呼是很开心的——我亲爱的彼得！实际上，这一切都如此怡人心脾——银器、那些椅子，一切都令人陶醉！","But it was delicious to hear her say that—my dear Peter!Indeed, it was all so delicious—the silver, the chairs; all so delicious!"
"为什么她不想请他参加宴会呢？他问。当然，克拉丽莎想，他很迷人！异常迷人！现在，我想起要我做决定不嫁给他是多么困难——为什么我做了那样的决定？她寻思着，就在那个可怕的夏天。","Why wouldn’t she ask him to her party? he asked.Now of course, thought Clarissa, he’s enchanting!perfectly enchanting!Now I remember how impossible it was ever to make up my mind—and why did I make up my mind—not to marry him?she wondered, that awful summer?"
"“但是你今天早晨来真是太非同寻常了！”她大声说道，双手交叉着，放在礼服上。","“But it’s so extraordinary that you should have come this morning!” she cried, putting her hands, one on top of another, down on her dress."
"“你还记不记得，”她说道，“以前在伯顿时，百叶窗常拍打得啪啪响？”","“Do you remember,” she said, “how the blinds used to flap at Bourton?”"
"“就是。”他说道。于是他又忆起单独和她父亲共进早餐，实在尴尬极了。她父亲过世了。他也没有给克拉丽莎写过信。可是他从未和老帕里融洽相处过，那是位爱抱怨、犹犹豫豫的老人，克拉丽莎的父亲——贾斯廷·帕里。","“They did,” he said; and he remembered breakfasting alone, very awkwardly, with her father; who had died; and he had not written to Clarissa.But he had never got on well with old Parry, that querulous, weak-kneed old man, Clarissa’s father, Justin Parry."
"“我常想要是和你父亲相处得更融洽就好了。”他说道。","“I often wish I’d got on better with your father,” he said."
"“但是他从未喜欢过任何人——我们的朋友。”克拉丽莎说道。她真应咬住自己的舌头，因为如此的话便让彼得忆起他曾想娶她。","“But he never liked any one who—our friends,” said Clarissa; and could have bitten her tongue for thus reminding Peter that he had wanted to marry her."
"当然我想过娶你，彼得心想，这差点让我的心都碎了，沉浸在自己的悲伤中，这悲伤就像从露台上看到的月亮一样慢慢升起，在暮色中显出苍白的美。自那以后我从未如此悲痛过，他想。好像他确实在露台上坐着，侧身向克拉丽莎移了移，伸出手，抬起手，又垂下来。那明月，就悬挂在他们头上。她也好像与他一起在露台上坐着，沉浸在月色中。","Of course I did, thought Peter; it almost broke my heart too, he thought; and was overcome with his own grief, which rose like a moon looked at from a terrace, ghastly beautiful with light from the sunken day.I was more unhappy than I’ve ever been since, he thought.And as if in truth he were sitting there on the terrace he edged a little towards Clarissa; put his hand out; raised it; let it fall.There above them it hung, that moon.She too seemed to be sitting with him on the terrace, in the moonlight."
"“赫伯特现在拥有那地方了。”她说道。“如今我从不去那里。”她说道。","“Herbert has it now,” she said.“I never go there now,” she said."
"此时，就像月光下露台上发生的场景，一个人由于已经感到无聊而开始觉得羞愧，可是另一个人默默地坐着，十分安静，哀伤地望着那明月，不愿说什么，只是动了动脚，清了清喉咙，留心到桌腿上的漩涡形铁饰，动了一下一片树叶，却一声不响——彼得·沃尔什现在就是这样。因为何故要如此回忆过去呢？他想。为何又要他忆起往昔呢？她已如此无情地折磨过他，干嘛还要让他痛苦？为什么？“你还记得那个湖吗？”她突然说道，内心强烈的感情压得她喉咙肌肉变僵，当她说“湖”字时，嘴唇在颤抖。因为她那时候是个小孩，站在她父母中间扔面包给鸭子吃，而同时也是一个成年女人，怀抱着自己的生活来到站在湖畔的父母跟前。她走近他们时，她怀抱着的生活愈发丰满，直到成为一个完整的生活、圆满的生活，她把这生活放到他们身边，说：“这即是我成就的生活！就是这个！”","Then, just as happens on a terrace in the moonlight, when one person begins to feel ashamed that he is already bored, and yet as the other sits silent, very quiet, sadly looking at the moon, does not like to speak, moves his foot, clears his throat, notices some iron scroll on a table leg, stirs a leaf, but says nothing—so Peter Walsh did now.For why go back like this to the past? he thought. Why make him think of it again?Why make him suffer, when she had tortured him so infernally? Why?“Do you remember the lake?” she said, in an abrupt voice, under the pressure of an emotion which caught her heart, made the muscles of her throat stiff, and contracted her lips in a spasm as she said “lake.”For she was a child, throwing bread to the ducks, between her parents, and at the same time a grown woman coming to her parents who stood by the lake, holding her life in her arms which, as she neared them, grew larger and larger in her arms, until it became a whole life, a complete life, which she put down by them and said, “This is what I have made of it! This!”"
"而她成就了什么呢？","And what had she made of it?"
"到底是什么？不过是今早与彼得一起坐在那里缝缝补补。","What, indeed? sitting there sewing this morning with Peter."
"她看着彼得·沃尔什，她的目光穿越了那段时间和那段感情，将信将疑地落在他身上，眼里含着泪水。随即她拾起目光，飘走了。就像一只鸟儿暂落枝头，又飞起来振翼远去。她一点都没有掩饰地地擦拭了自己的双眼。","She looked at Peter Walsh; her look, passing through all that time and that emotion, reached him doubtfully; settled on him tearfully; and rose and fluttered away, as a bird touches a branch and rises and flutters away.Quite simply she wiped her eyes."
"“是的。”彼得说道。“是的，是的，是的。”他一直说，似乎她将某个东西拉到了表面，在它升起时无疑伤到他了。不要说了！不要说了！他想要大喊。因为他年龄不大，他的生活尚未到头，绝对没到头。他刚刚五十出头。我应不应该告诉她呢？他想。他想要和盘托出。可她这么冷淡，他心想，总是拿着她的剪刀缝缝补补。","“Yes,” said Peter.“Yes, yes, yes,” he said, as if she drew up to the surface something which positively hurt him as it rose.Stop! Stop! he wanted to cry.For he was not old; his life was not over; not by any means.He was only just past fifty.Shall I tell her, he thought, or not?He would like to make a clean breast of it all.But she is too cold, he thought; sewing, with her scissors;"
"黛西在克拉丽莎身边看起来会很普通。而她会觉得我是一个失败者，在他们眼中我的确如此，他寻思着，在达洛维一家眼中，我是个失败者。噢，没错，他对此深信不疑，他是失败的。与这一切比起来——有镶饰的桌子、嵌宝石的裁纸刀、那海豚与烛台、椅布与古典名贵的英国套色版画——他是一个失败的人！我痛恨这一切所透漏出来的洋洋自得，他想着，我痛恨理查德的所作所为，不是克拉丽莎的作风，只不过她与他结婚了。（此刻露西进屋来了，端着银餐具，更多的银餐具。在她屈身放置银器时，他想着，她看起来很迷人——纤细、优雅。）然而这一直以来都在继续！他想，一周周过去了，克拉丽莎的生活。而我呢——他想，每一件事立刻好像都自他身上散发出来——旅行、骑马、吵架、冒险、桥牌聚会、风流韵事、工作、工作、工作！而他毫不掩饰地掏出了小刀——那陈旧的牛角柄刀，克拉丽莎可以保证这把刀已经跟随他三十年了——紧握在拳头里。","Daisy would look ordinary beside Clarissa.And she would think me a failure, which I am in their sense, he thought; in the Dalloways’ sense.Oh yes, he had no doubt about that; he was a failure, compared with all this—the inlaid table, the mounted paper-knife, the dolphin and the candlesticks, the chair-covers and the old valuable English tinted prints—he was a failure!I detest the smugness of the whole affair, he thought; Richard’s doing, not Clarissa’s; save that she married him.(Here Lucy came into the room, carrying silver, more silver, but charming, slender, graceful she looked, he thought, as she stooped to put it down.) And this has been going on all the time!he thought; week after week; Clarissa’s life; while I—he thought; and at once everything seemed to radiate from him; journeys; rides; quarrels; adventures; bridge parties; love affairs; work; work, work!and he took out his knife quite openly—his old horn-handled knife which Clarissa could swear he had had these thirty years—and clenched his fist upon it."
"那真是个奇怪的习惯，克拉丽莎想，老是把玩一把刀。还老是让人觉得轻佻，头脑简单，仅仅是个愚蠢的话匣子，正如他以前所说的那样。可我也是啊，她心想，接着拿起针，召唤帮助，好似一个由于卫兵睡着了而失去防卫的王后（他的拜访让她很是惊讶——这令她沮丧），所以无论谁都能溜进来，看见她躺在荆棘丛中召唤帮助，召唤她做过的事情，她喜欢的事情，她的丈夫，伊丽莎白，她自己。简而言之，彼得如今几乎对现在的她一无所知，全都来到她这里，打退敌人。","What an extraordinary habit that was, Clarissa thought; always playing with a knife.Always making one feel, too, frivolous; empty-minded; a mere silly chatterbox, as he used.But I too, she thought, and, taking up her needle, summoned, like a Queen whose guards have fallen asleep and left her unprotected (she had been quite taken aback by this visit—it had upset her) so that any one can stroll in and have a look at her where she lies with the brambles curving over her, summoned to her help the things she did; the things she liked; her husband; Elizabeth; her self, in short, which Peter hardly knew now, all to come about her and beat off the enemy."
"“哦，你怎么样了？”她说。好比战斗打响前，马蹄刨地，昂头，光照耀在两侧胁腹上，脖子弯起。就这样，彼得·沃尔什与克拉丽莎在蓝色沙发上肩并肩坐着，互相挑战。他的力量在身体里翻滚着。他从各个方面汇合了各种各样的事情——对他的赞美，他在牛津的事业，他的婚姻，对此她全然不知，他怎样恋爱的，还有总而言之，他怎样完成了自己的职责的。","“Well, and what’s happened to you?” she said.So before a battle begins, the horses paw the ground; toss their heads; the light shines on their flanks; their necks curve.So Peter Walsh and Clarissa, sitting side by side on the blue sofa, challenged each other.His powers chafed and tossed in him.He assembled from different quarters all sorts of things; praise; his career at Oxford; his marriage, which she knew nothing whatever about; how he had loved; and altogether done his job."
"“数以千百万件事！”他大喊，接着，这股汇聚起来的力量此刻横冲直撞，立即让他觉得可怕又异常兴奋。宛如被一些他再也看不到的人们扛在肩上，在空中快速前进，在这股力量的激励之下，他将手抬到额前。","“Millions of things!” he exclaimed, and, urged by the assembly of powers which were now charging this way and that and giving him the feeling at once frightening and extremely exhilarating of being rushed through the air on the shoulders of people he could no longer see, he raised his hands to his forehead."
"克拉丽莎坐得笔挺，屏住呼吸。","Clarissa sat very upright; drew in her breath."
"“我在恋爱。”他说道，但不是讲给她听的，而是对着黑暗中升起的某个人说的，那样你就无法感触到她，只能在黑暗中把你的花环放在草地上。","“I am in love,” he said, not to her however, but to some one raised up in the dark so that you could not touch her but must lay your garland down on the grass in the dark."
"“恋爱，”他重复说，此时是相当冷淡地对克拉丽莎·达洛维说，“爱上一个印度的姑娘。”他已把花环放下了。克拉丽莎愿意怎样就怎样。","“In love,” he repeated, now speaking rather dryly to Clarissa Dalloway; “in love with a girl in India.”He had deposited his garland.Clarissa could make what she would of it."
"“恋爱！”她说道。在他那年龄，戴着一个蝴蝶领结，竟然会被那怪物吞掉！他的脖子瘦得皮包骨，手红红的，他还比我大六个月呢！她的眼神返回到自己身上，可她心里仍然感觉到他恋爱了。他拥有了爱情，她感觉到了，他陷入了爱情。","“In love!” she said.That he at his age should be sucked under in his little bow-tie by that monster!And there’s no flesh on his neck; his hands are red; and he’s six months older than I am!her eye flashed back to her; but in her heart she felt, all the same, he is in love.He has that, she felt; he is in love."
"然而那不可战胜的唯我主义永远要踏翻反对它的大军，它是一条喊着前进、前进、前进的河，即使它承认我们或许没有任何目的，依旧要前进、前进。这不可战胜的唯我主义令她双颊泛红，使她看来十分年轻，肤色粉嫩，眼睛炯炯有神。她坐在那里，把礼服放在膝盖上，针把绿色丝线拉到头后停在那里，身子有些战栗。他在恋爱！不是与她相爱。当然，是与一个更年轻的女人相爱。","But the indomitable egotism which for ever rides down the hosts opposed to it, the river which says on, on, on; even though, it admits, there may be no goal for us whatever, still on, on; this indomitable egotism charged her cheeks with colour; made her look very young; very pink; very bright-eyed as she sat with her dress upon her knee, and her needle held to the end of green silk, trembling a little.He was in love!Not with her.With some younger woman, of course."
"“那她是谁？”她问。","“And who is she?” she asked."
"这时，得把这尊雕像从高处取下来放在他们中央。","Now this statue must be brought from its height and set down between them."
"“一个有夫之妇，真不幸，”他说，“她是一个印度陆军少校的妻子。”","“A married woman, unfortunately,” he said; “the wife of a Major in the Indian Army.”"
"他的笑容带有奇怪的讽刺意味，此刻他就用这种荒谬的方式把她置于克拉丽莎眼前。","And with a curious ironical sweetness he smiled as he placed her in this ridiculous way before Clarissa."
"（尽管如此，他恋爱了，克拉丽莎想。）","(All the same, he is in love, thought Clarissa.)"
"“她生育了，”他十分理智地说下去，“两个很小的孩子，一男一女。我来就是要与我的律师商议离婚事宜。”","“She has,” he continued, very reasonably, “two small children; a boy and a girl; and I have come over to see my lawyers about the divorce.”"
"他们的情形就是这样！他想。","There they are! he thought."
"你想对他们怎样就怎样吧，克拉丽莎！他们的情形就是这样！时间一分一秒地过去了，克拉丽莎注视着他们时，他仿佛觉得那印度陆军少校的妻子（他的黛西）和她的两个孩子显得愈发可爱。似乎他点亮了盘中一颗灰色小球，于是在他们俩轻快的、充满海盐味的亲密氛围中长出一株可爱的树（因为从某种程度上来讲，没人能像克拉丽莎一样理解他，与他有共鸣）——他们格外地亲密。","Do what you like with them, Clarissa!There they are!And second by second it seemed to him that the wife of the Major in the Indian Army (his Daisy) and her two small children became more and more lovely as Clarissa looked at them; as if he had set light to a grey pellet on a plate and there had risen up a lovely tree in the brisk sea-salted air of their intimacy (for in some ways no one understood him, felt with him, as Clarissa did)—their exquisite intimacy."
"她奉承他，她欺骗他，克拉丽莎心想。她用刀三下就刻画出那女人的嘴脸，那印度陆军少校的妻子。真是糟蹋了他！真愚蠢！彼得一生都那样被人愚弄。起初是被牛津勒令退学，接着是娶了在去印度船上认识的一个姑娘。如今又认识了印度陆军少校的妻子——谢天谢地，她拒绝了他的求婚！尽管如此，他恋爱了。她的故友，她亲爱的彼得，恋爱了。","She flattered him; she fooled him, thought Clarissa; shaping the woman, the wife of the Major in the Indian Army, with three strokes of a knife.What a waste!What a folly!All his life long Peter had been fooled like that; first getting sent down from Oxford; next marrying the girl on the boat going out to India; now the wife of a Major in the Indian Army—thank Heaven she had refused to marry him!Still, he was in love; her old friend, her dear Peter, he was in love."
"“那你准备怎么做呢？”她问他。哦，这是那些律师先生的事。林肯法律协会的胡珀与格雷特利律师事务所的律师会去解决这件事的，他这样说。接着，他居然用他的折刀修起指甲来。","“But what are you going to do?” she asked him.Oh the lawyers and solicitors, Messrs.Hooper and Grateley of Lincoln’s Inn, they were going to do it, he said.And he actually pared his nails with his pocket-knife."
"看在上帝的份上，别玩你的刀了！她抑制不住愤怒，在心里大喊。他傻里傻气地不谙世故，他的软弱，他丝毫不注意其他人的感受，这些都让她生气，始终让她生气。而且到了现在这个年纪，多愚蠢！","For Heaven’s sake, leave your knife alone!she cried to herself in irrepressible irritation; it was his silly unconventionality, his weakness; his lack of the ghost of a notion what any one else was feeling that annoyed her, had always annoyed her; and now at his age, how silly!"
"这一切我都明白，彼得心想。我明白我面临的是什么，他想，手指顺着刀刃滑动，面对的是克拉丽莎、达洛维及他们那一群人。不过我要展示给克拉丽莎看——此时，令他十分惊讶的是，忽然间他被那些从空中丢下来的、不可控制的力量压倒。他放声大哭，丝毫不感到羞耻。他坐在沙发上，眼泪顺着面颊流淌。","I know all that, Peter thought; I know what I’m up against, he thought, running his finger along the blade of his knife, Clarissa and Dalloway and all the rest of them; but I’ll show Clarissa—and then to his utter surprise, suddenly thrown by those uncontrollable forces thrown through the air, he burst into tears; wept; wept without the least shame, sitting on the sofa, the tears running down his cheeks."
"克拉丽莎身体前倾，抓住他的手，将他拉到自己身边，亲吻他——实际上，在她可以压抑住胸中那飞舞的银光闪闪的羽翼之前，就感觉到了贴在她面颊上的他的脸——好似热带强风中舞动的蒲苇草。胸中的强风逐渐消退，只剩下她抓着他的手，轻拍他的膝头，她往后靠去时，觉得跟他一起特别放松，无忧无虑。忽然一个想法掠过她脑际，如果我嫁给了他，这种欢乐就会一整天陪伴着我。","And Clarissa had leant forward, taken his hand, drawn him to her, kissed him,—actually had felt his face on hers before she could down the brandishing of silver flashing—plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in her breast, which, subsiding, left her holding his hand, patting his knee and, feeling as she sat back extraordinarily at her ease with him and light-hearted, all in a clap it came over her, If I had married him, this gaiety would have been mine all day!"
"对她而言，一切都已完结。床单铺得很平展，床窄窄的。她一个人走上塔顶，剩下其他人在太阳下采摘黑莓。门关上了，在脱落的墙皮灰土和乱七八糟的鸟窝中，景色看起来是那么遥远，传来微弱冰冷的声音（曾经在利思山上，她记得），理查德，理查德！她呼唤着，像一个夜间酣睡的人被惊醒了，在黑夜中伸手求助。与布鲁顿女士共进午餐，她的脑海中又浮现出这事。他扔下我，我永远是孤独的，她心想，双手交叉搁在膝前。","It was all over for her.The sheet was stretched and the bed narrow.She had gone up into the tower alone and left them blackberrying in the sun.The door had shut, and there among the dust of fallen plaster and the litter of birds’ nests how distant the view had looked, and the sounds came thin and chill (once on Leith Hill, she remembered), and Richard, Richard!she cried, as a sleeper in the night starts and stretches a hand in the dark for help.Lunching with Lady Bruton, it came back to her.He has left me; I am alone for ever, she thought, folding her hands upon her knee."
"彼得·沃尔什起身来，走到窗边，背朝她站着，轻轻挥舞着一张印花大手帕。他看上去娴熟、乏味、孤独。他瘦瘦的肩胛将他的外衣轻轻撑起来，用力地擤着鼻子。带我和你一起走，克拉丽莎冲动地想道，似乎他即将开始一次伟大的航程。然后，下一刻，似乎曾使人极度兴奋和感动的五幕剧此时结束了，她在剧中过完了一生，曾离家出走，曾与彼得一起生活过，如今这些都结束了。","Peter Walsh had got up and crossed to the window and stood with his back to her, flicking a bandanna handkerchief from side to side.Masterly and dry and desolate he looked, his thin shoulder-blades lifting his coat slightly; blowing his nose violently.Take me with you, Clarissa thought impulsively, as if he were starting directly upon some great voyage; and then, next moment, it was as if the five acts of a play that had been very exciting and moving were now over and she had lived a lifetime in them and had run away, had lived with Peter, and it was now over."
"此刻是时候该行动了，就像一个女士把她的东西收好，她的披风、手套、观剧用的小型望远镜，起身离开剧场向街上走去，她从沙发上起身走向彼得。","Now it was time to move, and, as a woman gathers her things together, her cloak, her gloves, her opera-glasses, and gets up to go out of the theatre into the street, she rose from the sofa and went to Peter."
"这真是太奇怪了，他想，当她随着叮当声和沙沙声走过来时，仍然有一股力量，当她穿过屋子时，仍然有一股力量，让他所憎恶的月亮在夏季天空下的伯顿露台上冉冉上升。","And it was awfully strange, he thought, how she still had the power, as she came tinkling, rustling, still had the power as she came across the room, to make the moon, which he detested, rise at Bourton on the terrace in the summer sky."
"“告诉我，”他说，一边抓着她的双肩，“你快乐吗，克拉丽莎？理查德是否？”","“Tell me,” he said, seizing her by the shoulders.“Are you happy, Clarissa? Does Richard—”"
"门打开了。","The door opened."
"“这是我的伊丽莎白。”克拉丽莎说道，充满了感情，可能有点做作。","“Here is my Elizabeth,” said Clarissa, emotionally, histrionically, perhaps."
"“您好吗？”伊丽莎白向前走来问候。","“How d’y do?” said Elizabeth coming forward."
"大本钟在他们中间格外高亢地敲响半点钟，就像一个强壮的年轻人，淡漠、不顾及别人，来回地摇晃着哑铃。","The sound of Big Ben striking the half-hour struck out between them with extraordinary vigour, as if a young man, strong, indifferent, inconsiderate, were swinging dumb-bells this way and that."
"“你好，伊丽莎白！”彼得喊道，将他的手帕塞进口袋，迅速走向她，一面说，“再见，克拉丽莎”，却没看她，迅速离开了屋子，跑下了楼，打开了门厅的门。","“Hullo, Elizabeth!” cried Peter, stuffing his handkerchief into his pocket, going quickly to her, saying “Good-bye, Clarissa” without looking at her, leaving the room quickly, and running downstairs and opening the hall door."
"“彼得！彼得！”克拉丽莎大喊，紧跟他走到楼梯平台。“我今晚的聚会！要记得我今晚的聚会！”她大喊着，不得不提高声音来震住户外的嘈杂。她的声音淹没在来往的车辆和钟声里，当她大喊“记得我今晚的聚会”时，彼得关上了门，那声音听起来虚弱、单薄、悠远。","“Peter! Peter!” cried Clarissa, following him out on to the landing.“My party tonight!Remember my party tonight!” she cried, having to raise her voice against the roar of the open air, and, overwhelmed by the traffic and the sound of all the clocks striking, her voice crying “Remember my party tonight!” sounded frail and thin and very far away as Peter Walsh shut the door."
"记得我的聚会，记得我的聚会，彼得·沃尔什走到街上时有节拍地喃喃自语，和着大本钟敲响半点钟那直截了当的声波。（一圈圈铅般沉重的声波在空气中消融。）噢，这些聚会，他想道，克拉丽莎的聚会。为何她要举行这些聚会，他思索着。他并不怪她，也不责怪迎面而来的这个穿着燕尾服，纽扣孔插着一朵康乃馨的雕像似的男人。世上只有一人能够如他一般陷入爱情。他就在这里，他是个幸运儿。他自己的影像映在维多利亚大街上一个汽车制造厂的厚玻璃窗上。整个印度都展现在他背后，平原、山脉、霍乱。比爱尔兰广阔两倍的区域。他独自作出决定——他，彼得·沃尔什，如今在他一生中第一次真正地陷入了爱情。克拉丽莎变得心肠很硬，他心想，而且他怀疑还有些多愁善感，同时望着那些有能耐的大型汽车——多少加仑汽油可以行驶多少英里？他在机械方面有天赋，在他居住的地区发明了一种犁，还从英国订购过手推车，可那些苦力不愿使用这些工具。所有这些克拉丽莎都毫不知情。","Remember my party, remember my party, said Peter Walsh as he stepped down the street, speaking to himself rhythmically, in time with the flow of the sound, the direct downright sound of Big Ben striking the half-hour.(The leaden circles dissolved in the air.) Oh these parties, he thought; Clarissa’s parties.Why does she give these parties, he thought.Not that he blamed her or this effigy of a man in a tail-coat with a carnation in his buttonhole coming towards him.Only one person in the world could be as he was, in love.And there he was, this fortunate man, himself, reflected in the plate-glass window of a motor-car manufacturer in Victoria Street.All India lay behind him; plains, mountains; epidemics of cholera; a district twice as big as Ireland; decisions he had come to alone—he, Peter Walsh; who was now really for the first time in his life, in love.Clarissa had grown hard, he thought; and a trifle sentimental into the bargain, he suspected, looking at the great motor-cars capable of doing—how many miles on how many gallons?For he had a turn for mechanics; had invented a plough in his district, had ordered wheel-barrows from England, but the coolies wouldn’t use them, all of which Clarissa knew nothing whatever about."
"她说“这是我的伊丽莎白”的语气——让他生气。为何不是简单地说“这是伊丽莎白”？这不诚恳。而伊丽莎白也不喜欢这样。（响亮沉重的钟声的最后一丝余波依旧震荡着他四周的空气，半点钟，时间尚早，才十一点半。）因为他理解年轻人，他喜欢他们。克拉丽莎身上总有一丝淡漠，他认为。即使在她还是少女的时侯，她就一直有些胆怯，到了中年就变成了因循守旧，然后一切全结束了，全结束了，他想着，十分阴郁地朝玻璃窗深处望去，想知道是否因为那个时刻的来访惹恼了她。忽然间，他感到十分羞愧，觉得自己就像一个傻瓜一样，哭泣，情绪激动，把什么都告诉了她，像往常一样，像往常一样。","The way she said “Here is my Elizabeth!”—that annoyed him.Why not “Here’s Elizabeth” simply?It was insincere.And Elizabeth didn’t like it either.(Still the last tremors of the great booming voice shook the air round him; the half-hour; still early; only half-past eleven still.) For he understood young people; he liked them.There was always something cold in Clarissa, he thought.She had always, even as a girl, a sort of timidity, which in middle age becomes conventionality, and then it’s all up, it’s all up, he thought, looking rather drearily into the glassy depths, and wondering whether by calling at that hour he had annoyed her; overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool; wept; been emotional; told her everything, as usual, as usual."
"宛若一朵云遮掩了太阳，静谧笼罩了伦敦，落在心上。努力结束了。光阴在拍打桅杆。我们在此停顿，我们在此驻足。唯有僵硬的习俗的骨骼支撑着人的身躯。里面没有任何东西，彼得·沃尔什自言自语道，感觉自己被挖空了，体内彻底空荡荡了。克拉丽莎拒绝了我，他想。他站在那里思索着，克拉丽莎拒绝了我。","As a cloud crosses the sun, silence falls on London; and falls on the mind.Effort ceases.Time flaps on the mast.There we stop; there we stand.Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame.Where there is nothing, Peter Walsh said to himself; feeling hollowed out, utterly empty within.Clarissa refused me, he thought.He stood there thinking, Clarissa refused me."
"啊——圣玛格丽特教堂的钟声说，就像一个女主人在钟声响起那一刻走进自家客厅，才发觉她的宾客们已经到了——我没有迟到。","Ah, said St. Margaret’s, like a hostess who comes into her drawing-room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already. I am not late."
"还不迟，刚好十一点半，她说道。可是，虽然她完全正确，她的嗓音，她女主人的嗓音，却不情愿显露个性。压抑她的是对过去的某种悲痛，对现在的某种担心。十一点半了，她说道，圣玛格丽特的钟声潜入了心底深处，在一圈圈的声波中隐没，像是什么有生命的东西要向自己吐露心声，驱散自己，随着快乐的颤栗而静止——就像克拉丽莎自己，彼得·沃尔什寻思着，一边穿着白衣在钟声响起时走下楼来。那是克拉丽莎自己，他想着，情绪激动，格外清醒，又十分困惑地追忆着她，似乎这钟声几年前就回响在屋里，在某个时刻他们非常亲昵地坐在那里，互吐衷肠，像一只蜜蜂采蜜归去，载满那一刻的甜蜜而去。然而是在哪间屋子？什么时刻？在钟声敲响时，他又为何觉得如此透彻心扉地愉悦？于是，在圣玛格丽特的钟声减弱时，他想，她患过病，而这钟声就表示虚弱和苦痛。她有心脏病，他想起来了，突然变得响亮的最后一次钟声是死亡的丧钟，在生命的中途突至而来。克拉丽莎倒在了她站立的地方，她的客厅中。不行！不行！他喊道。她没死！","No, it is precisely half-past eleven, she says.Yet, though she is perfectly right, her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality.Some grief for the past holds it back; some concern for the present.It is half-past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret’s glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest—like Clarissa herself, thought Peter Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white.It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey, laden with the moment.But what room?What moment?And why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was striking?Then, as the sound of St. Margaret’s languished, he thought. She has been ill, and the sound expressed languor and suffering.It was her heart, he remembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she stood, in her drawing-room.No! No! he cried. She is not dead!"
"我没有老，他哭喊，又沿着怀特霍尔街前行，似乎他那朝气蓬勃的、永恒的将来朝他滚滚而来。","I am not old, he cried, and marched up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending, his future."
"他丝毫没老，也不固执、不乏味。至于别人怎么说他——达洛维一家、惠特布雷德一家，还有他们那群人，他毫不介意——丝毫不介意（尽管他的确早晚得考虑理查德能否可以帮他找个差事）。他大步流星，目不转睛，直盯着坎布里奇公爵的雕像。他被牛津开除过——千真万确。他过去是个社会主义信奉者，从某种意义上来看是个失败者——千真万确。不过他认为，文明的前景掌握在那样的年轻人手里，好比三十年前的他那样的年轻人手里，他们热爱抽象原理，从伦敦订购书刊，一直寄到喜马拉雅山的一个巅峰，他们阅读科学，阅读哲学。未来就在那样的年轻人的掌握中，他想道。","He was not old, or set, or dried in the least.As for caring what they said of him—the Dalloways, the Whitbreads, and their set, he cared not a straw—not a straw (though it was true he would have, some time or other, to see whether Richard couldn’t help him to some job).Striding, staring, he glared at the statue of the Duke of Cambridge.He had been sent down from Oxford—true.He had been a Socialist, in some sense a failure—true.Still the future of civilisation lies, he thought, in the hands of young men like that; of young men such as he was, thirty years ago; with their love of abstract principles; getting books sent out to them all the way from London to a peak in the Himalayas; reading science; reading philosophy.The future lies in the hands of young men like that, he thought."
"他背后传出类似树丛中叶子翻飞的啪哒声，带有一点沙沙声和有规律的砰砰声，这声音赶上他后，击打着他的思绪，令他止不住严格地和着这拍子，走在怀特霍尔街上。男孩们穿着制服，端着枪，双眼凝视前方行进，行进。他们的臂膀僵直，面部表情犹如刻在雕像底座周围的赞颂尽职、感恩、忠贞、热爱英国的铭文。","A patter like the patter of leaves in a wood came from behind, and with it a rustling, regular thudding sound, which as it overtook him drummed his thoughts, strict in step, up Whitehall, without his doing.Boys in uniform, carrying guns, marched with their eyes ahead of them, marched, their arms stiff, and on their faces an expression like the letters of a legend written round the base of a statue praising duty, gratitude, fidelity, love of England."
"彼得·沃尔什开始与他们保持步调一致，感到这是一个很好的锻炼。可他们看起来并不健壮。这些十六岁的男孩多半是瘦弱的，或许明天就会在放有一碗碗米饭、一块块肥皂的柜台后站着。此时他们带着从芬斯伯里大街取来花环的同样的肃穆表情——毫未参杂感官享乐或日常烦扰——去把花圈祭奠给那座空墓。他们已经起誓。来往的车辆敬重他们，货车止行。","It is, thought Peter Walsh, beginning to keep step with them, a very fine training.But they did not look robust.They were weedy for the most part, boys of sixteen, who might, tomorrow, stand behind bowls of rice, cakes of soap on counters.Now they wore on them unmixed with sensual pleasure or daily preoccupations the solemnity of the wreath which they had fetched from Finsbury Pavement to the empty tomb.They had taken their vow.The traffic respected it; vans were stopped."
"我跟不上他们了，彼得·沃尔什想道，他们正朝着怀特霍尔街行进，果真如此，他们继续行进着，超越了他，超越了每个人，步伐稳健，似乎有一个意志使手腿一致。而生活，变化多端、生气勃勃的，被压在了纪念碑和花环铺就的路面下，为纪律麻痹成一具瞪眼的僵尸。人们只好尊重它，人们或许会嘲笑，不过必须得尊重它，他想。他们走到那边去了，彼得·沃尔什想着，一边在人行道边上停了下来。所有那些高耸的塑像，纳尔逊、戈登、哈夫洛克，那些伟大战士的伟岸的黑色身影矗立着眺望前方，似乎他们也作了相同的克己牺牲（彼得·沃尔什觉得他也如此，作了伟大的克己牺牲），把相同的引诱踩在脚下，终究变成那大理石像上冷漠的目光。然而彼得·沃尔什自身丝毫不想要这种目光，虽然他能尊重他人的这种目光。他能尊重男孩们的这种目光。他们尚未懂得众生的烦扰，他想，此时朝滨河马路前进的男孩们慢慢消失了——那一切我都经历过了，他想，一边穿过马路，站在戈登的塑像下，还在他孩提时，就崇拜戈登。戈登孤零零地伫立在那里，抬起一条腿，交叉着双臂——可怜的戈登，他想道。","I can’t keep up with them, Peter Walsh thought, as they marched up Whitehall, and sure enough, on they marched, past him, past every one, in their steady way, as if one will worked legs and arms uniformly, and life, with its varieties, its irreticences, had been laid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline.One had to respect it; one might laugh; but one had to respect it, he thought.There they go, thought Peter Walsh, pausing at the edge of the pavement; and all the exalted statues, Nelson, Gordon, Havelock, the black, the spectacular images of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them, as if they too had made the same renunciation (Peter Walsh felt he too had made it, the great renunciation), trampled under the same temptations, and achieved at length a marble stare.But the stare Peter Walsh did not want for himself in the least; though he could respect it in others.He could respect it in boys.They don’t know the troubles of the flesh yet, he thought, as the marching boys disappeared in the direction of the Strand—all that I’ve been through, he thought, crossing the road, and standing under Gordon’s statue, Gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped; Gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed,—poor Gordon, he thought."
"恰好因为谁也不知晓他在伦敦，克拉丽莎除外，而且航行之后，对他而言大地依然像座岛屿，因而当他独自一人、充满活力、无人知悉地于十一点半站在特拉法尔加广场时的陌生之感令他无法忍受。这是怎么回事？我在哪里？究竟为何有人要做这件事？他思索着，离婚看似纯粹空谈。他的心情低落得平如沼泽，三种强烈的情感击倒了他：领悟，无边的博爱，最后是压抑不住的无比快乐，似乎这是其他两种情感的产物。好似他的头脑里有其他人的手在拽动绳子，移动百叶窗，而他与这一切没有任何瓜葛，站在无止境的大道路口，假如他愿意便可顺着大道漫步。多年以来他都没有觉得如此年轻。","And just because nobody yet knew he was in London, except Clarissa, and the earth, after the voyage, still seemed an island to him, the strangeness of standing alone, alive, unknown, at half-past eleven in Trafalgar Square overcame him.What is it?Where am I?And why, after all, does one do it?he thought, the divorce seeming all moonshine.And down his mind went flat as a marsh, and three great emotions bowled over him; understanding; a vast philanthropy; and finally, as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite delight; as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled, shutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at the opening of endless avenues, down which if he chose he might wander.He had not felt so young for years."
"他已逃脱！彻底自由了——就如习惯遭破坏后，心灵就像未受保护的火苗，上下乱窜，恍惚即将被从灯台上吹下来。多年以来我都没觉得如此年轻了！彼得想着，逃脱了原本的他（当然仅仅只有一小时左右），就像一个跑到户外的孩子，奔跑时看见他的老保姆在一个搞错的窗边朝他挥手。不过她格外地迷人，他想，一边穿越特拉法尔加广场，朝干草市方向走去。迎面走来一位妙龄女郞，她走过戈登的塑像时，彼得·沃尔什觉得（他十分敏感），似乎退下了一层层面纱，终于变成他一直心仪的那位女子——青春却又庄重，快乐却又慎重，皮肤黝黑却十分迷人。","He had escaped!was utterly free—as happens in the downfall of habit when the mind, like an unguarded flame, bows and bends and seems about to blow from its holding.I haven’t felt so young for years!thought Peter, escaping (only of course for an hour or so) from being precisely what he was, and feeling like a child who runs out of doors, and sees, as he runs, his old nurse waving at the wrong window.But she’s extraordinarily attractive, he thought, as, walking across Trafalgar Square in the direction of the Haymarket, came a young woman who, as she passed Gordon’s statue, seemed, Peter Walsh thought (susceptible as he was), to shed veil after veil, until she became the very woman he had always had in mind; young, but stately; merry, but discreet; black, but enchanting."
"他挺了挺身子，悄悄地拨弄着折刀，开始跟在这女郎身后，追寻他心仪的女子。这种激动，即便是背对着他，好像也给他带来一丝光亮，将他们连在一起，突出了他，似乎车水马龙随意的喧嚣声透过空握着的双手耳语着他的名字，并非彼得，而是他沉思时称呼自己的秘密名字。“你。”她说道，只有一声“你”，她用白手套和肩膀说道。随后她走过科克斯珀街上的登特商店时，风掀起她又薄又长的披风，带着包容一切的慈悲、凄婉的温柔，像是会张开来把疲惫之人拥入怀中的双臂——","Straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket-knife he started after her to follow this woman, this excitement, which seemed even with its back turned to shed on him a light which connected them, which singled him out, as if the random uproar of the traffic had whispered through hollowed hands his name, not Peter, but his private name which he called himself in his own thoughts.“You,” she said, only “you,” saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders.Then the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past Dent’s shop in Cockspur Street blew out with an enveloping kindness, a mournful tenderness, as of arms that would open and take the tired—"
"不过她尚未嫁人，她是年轻的，非常年轻，彼得想着。他瞧见她穿越特拉法尔加广场时佩戴的那朵红色康乃馨又在他眼里点燃了，使她的唇变得通红。不过她在人行道的边上等着。她有一种高贵的气质。她不如克拉丽莎那么俗气，不如克拉丽莎那么殷富。她走起来时，他思忖着，她是个体面女人吗？机智、能言善辩，他想着（因为人一定要虚构点什么，一定要给自己找点乐子），一种沉着的、呼之欲出的机智，毫不张扬。","But she’s not married; she’s young; quite young, thought Peter, the red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across Trafalgar Square burning again in his eyes and making her lips red.But she waited at the kerbstone.There was a dignity about her.She was not worldly, like Clarissa; not rich, like Clarissa.Was she, he wondered as she moved, respectable?Witty, with a lizard’s flickering tongue, he thought (for one must invent, must allow oneself a little diversion), a cool waiting wit, a darting wit; not noisy."
"她开始走起来，穿过了街道，他跟在她后面。他最不愿做的就是使她难堪。不过要是她停下来，他就会说：“来吃个冰淇淋吧。”他会说的，而她也会非常简明地回答：“那好吧。”","She moved; she crossed; he followed her.To embarrass her was the last thing he wished.Still if she stopped he would say “Come and have an ice,” he would say, and she would answer, perfectly simply, “Oh yes.”"
"可街道上的其他人阻在他们中间，挡住了他，遮住了她。他追随着，她有了变化。她的两颊泛红，眼神透出讥讽。他认为自己是一个冒险者，不计后果、迅捷、大胆，确实（事实上他昨晚才从印度抵达这里）是一个富于传奇色彩的海盗，不在乎这一切糟透了的繁文缛节，商店橱窗中的黄色晨袍、烟管、钓竿，也不在乎是否得体、晚宴、背心下面穿着白色内衣的、衣着整洁的老头。他是一个海盗。她继续走着，穿越了皮卡迪利大街，往摄政街走去。她的披风、手套、肩膀，结合橱窗中的流苏、蕾丝、羽毛围巾，形成了华丽而怪异的精神，渐渐减弱，从商店散到人行道上，就像夜晚的灯光摇曳地照耀着黑暗中的树篱。","But other people got between them in the street, obstructing him, blotting her out.He pursued; she changed.There was colour in her cheeks; mockery in her eyes; he was an adventurer, reckless, he thought, swift, daring, indeed (landed as he was last night from India) a romantic buccaneer, careless of all these damned proprieties, yellow dressing-gowns, pipes, fishing-rods, in the shop windows; and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats.He was a buccaneer.On and on she went, across Piccadilly, and up Regent Street, ahead of him, her cloak, her gloves, her shoulders combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the pavement, as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges in the darkness."
"她高兴地笑着，越过牛津街和大波特兰街，转入一条小街道下行，此时，此刻，这伟大的一刻即将来临，因为这时她放慢脚步，打开了包，往他的方向看了一眼，可不是在看他，那是告别的一瞥，总结了整个局面，成功地永远地离开了它，她将钥匙放入锁眼里，把门打开，不见了。克拉丽莎的话回荡在他的耳畔，记得我的聚会，记得我的聚会。这房子是那种单调的红房子，吊着暧昧不雅的花篮。这件事就结束了。","Laughing and delightful, she had crossed Oxford Street and Great Portland Street and turned down one of the little streets, and now, and now, the great moment was approaching, for now she slackened, opened her bag, and with one look in his direction, but not at him, one look that bade farewell, summed up the whole situation and dismissed it triumphantly, for ever, had fitted her key, opened the door, and gone!Clarissa’s voice saying, Remember my party, Remember my party, sang in his ears.The house was one of those flat red houses with hanging flower-baskets of vague impropriety.It was over."
"好吧，我挺开心的，我挺开心，他心想，同时抬头望着摇摆的、装着浅色天竺葵的篮子。但是它的快乐一下子被击得粉碎，因为他很清楚那快乐有一半是虚构的，是编造出来的。刚才与那位女孩的调情，是虚构出来的，好比人们虚构生活中美好的一面，他思索着——虚构自己，虚构她，营造无比地快乐，还有更多的什么。虽然很古怪，但又很真实。你永远无法与别人分享这一切——它被击得粉碎。","Well, I’ve had my fun; I’ve had it, he thought, looking up at the swinging baskets of pale geraniums.And it was smashed to atoms—his fun, for it was half made up, as he knew very well; invented, this escapade with the girl; made up, as one makes up the better part of life, he thought—making oneself up; making her up; creating an exquisite amusement, and something more.But odd it was, and quite true; all this one could never share—it smashed to atoms."
"他转过身，顺着街走，想要找一处地方坐坐，一直到了该去林肯法律协会——胡珀和格雷特利律师事务所——的时候。","He turned; went up the street, thinking to find somewhere to sit, till it was time for Lincoln’s Inn—for Messrs. Hooper and Grateley."
"他应去哪里啊？不要紧。那么，顺着这条路走，走向摄政公园。他的靴子在人行道上说着“不要紧”。因为时间尚早，仍然很早。","Where should he go?No matter.Up the street, then, towards Regent’s Park.His boots on the pavement struck out “no matter”; for it was early, still very early."
"这又是一个绚烂的早晨。街上处处洋溢着生机，就像一颗完好无损的心脏在跳动。没有摸索——没有踌躇。一辆汽车疾驰而来，突然转了个弯，就在那适当的一瞬间准确地、悄然无息地停在一扇门前。一个身材瘦削的女孩走下车来，她穿着长筒丝袜，头插羽饰，然而对他而言并不是格外地引人注目（因为他已恣意享乐过）。彼得透过敞开的门朝大厅望去，令人钦佩的男管家、棕黄色的中国狗，大厅铺着黑白相间的菱形地板，白色百叶窗飘舞着，他十分欣赏这一切。毕竟，伦敦以其自己的方式成就了一个辉煌的成绩，它的季节，它的文明。他出身在一个有威望的盎格鲁-印度家庭，起码有三代先辈曾参与过大陆事务的管理（他心想，真是奇怪，自己居然有这样的思想感情，他是那么讨厌印度、讨厌帝国，讨厌军队）。有时候，文明，即便是诸如此类的文明，也像私人物品一样令他感到珍贵。有时，他为英国自豪，为男管家、中国狗、为生活有保障的女孩感到自豪。","It was a splendid morning too.Like the pulse of a perfect heart, life struck straight through the streets.There was no fumbling—no hesitation.Sweeping and swerving, accurately, punctually, noiselessly, there, precisely at the right instant, the motor-car stopped at the door.The girl, silk-stockinged, feathered, evanescent, but not to him particularly attractive (for he had had his fling), alighted.Admirable butlers, tawny chow dogs, halls laid in black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing, Peter saw through the opened door and approved of.A splendid achievement in its own way, after all, London; the season; civilisation.Coming as he did from a respectable Anglo-Indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent (it’s strange, he thought, what a sentiment I have about that, disliking India, and empire, and army as he did), there were moments when civilisation, even of this sort, seemed dear to him as a personal possession; moments of pride in England; in butlers; chow dogs; girls in their security."
"真是荒唐可笑，可这情感仍然存在，他想。那些医生、商人，以及能干的女人都在忙着自己的事务，他们都准时、机警、健壮。对他来说，似乎都值得敬佩。他们是可以托付生命的好人，是生存技术方面的伴侣，可与之有难同当。这里啊，那里啊，眼前的景象还过得去，他要在树阴下坐下来，抽一支烟。","Ridiculous enough, still there it is, he thought.And the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business, punctual, alert, robust, seemed to him wholly admirable, good fellows, to whom one would entrust one’s life, companions in the art of living, who would see one through.What with one thing and another, the show was really very tolerable; and he would sit down in the shade and smoke."
"那就是摄政公园了。不错。他儿时曾在摄政公园散步——好奇怪，他心想，儿时的记忆怎么总是浮现在我的脑海——或许是看到了克拉丽莎的缘故吧，因为女人们比我们更多地活在往事中，他思索着。她们依恋着一些地方，依恋着父亲——女人永远为自己的父亲感到自豪。伯顿是一个不错的地方，一个很好的地方。不过，我和这老头永远也相处不了，他想。有一天夜里，我们大吵了一番——争论一件什么事情，至于具体是什么，他记不住了。可能是政治方面的事。","There was Regent’s Park.Yes.As a child he had walked in Regent’s Park—odd, he thought, how the thought of childhood keeps coming back to me—the result of seeing Clarissa, perhaps; for women live much more in the past than we do, he thought.They attach themselves to places; and their fathers—a woman’s always proud of her father.Bourton was a nice place, a very nice place, but I could never get on with the old man, he thought.There was quite a scene one night—an argument about something or other, what, he could not remember.Politics presumably."
"不错，他记得摄政公园。那又长又直的小路，左边售卖气球的小屋，有个地方还有一尊刻写着铭文的荒唐雕像。他在找一个空座位。他不想因为被人问时间而受到打扰（他觉得有些困倦）。一位年老的灰白头发的保姆，身边有个婴儿睡在童车里——这是他能为自己找到的最好的座位了。他就在保姆座位的另一端坐下来。","Yes, he remembered Regent’s Park; the long straight walk; the little house where one bought air-balls to the left; an absurd statue with an inscription somewhere or other.He looked for an empty seat.He did not want to be bothered (feeling a little drowsy as he did) by people asking him the time.An elderly grey nurse, with a baby asleep in its perambulator—that was the best he could do for himself; sit down at the far end of the seat by that nurse."
"他忽然记起伊丽莎白走进屋站在她母亲身边的样子，他想，她是个相貌奇特的女孩。身材高大，几乎长大成人了。不能算美，只能算端庄，她顶多十八岁。或许她与克拉丽莎的关系不大好。“这是我的伊丽莎白。”——诸如此类的事——为何不是简单地说“这是伊丽莎白”？——和多数母亲一样，想假装事情并非如此。她过分信赖自己的魅力了，他想。她做得过头了。","She’s a queer-looking girl, he thought, suddenly remembering Elizabeth as she came into the room and stood by her mother.Grown big; quite grown-up, not exactly pretty; handsome rather; and she can’t be more than eighteen.Probably she doesn’t get on with Clarissa.“There’s my Elizabeth”—that sort of thing—why not “Here’s Elizabeth” simply?—trying to make out, like most mothers, that things are what they’re not.She trusts to her charm too much, he thought.She overdoes it."
"浓烈温和的雪茄烟雾慢慢地旋进他的喉咙，又被他一圈一圈地吐出，一时间，烟圈勇敢地迎着空气而上，蓝蓝的，圆圆的——今晚我该试试单独与伊丽莎白聊聊，他想——接着开始晃动着成了沙漏的形状，渐渐变淡消逝。烟圈的样子真奇怪，他想。他忽然闭上双眼，努力抬起一只手，扔掉了沉沉的雪茄烟蒂。一把大刷子平滑地拂过他的脑际，拂过晃动的枝条、孩子的声音、纷乱的脚步声、往来的行人、过往车辆的起起伏伏的嗡鸣声。他往下沉啊，沉啊，陷入了羽毛般的梦境中，沉了下去，完全陷进去了。","The rich benignant cigar smoke eddied coolly down his throat; he puffed it out again in rings which breasted the air bravely for a moment; blue, circular—I shall try and get a word alone with Elizabeth tonight, he thought—then began to wobble into hour-glass shapes and taper away; odd shapes they take, he thought.Suddenly he closed his eyes, raised his hand with an effort, and threw away the heavy end of his cigar.A great brush swept smooth across his mind, sweeping across it moving branches, children’s voices, the shuffle of feet, and people passing, and humming traffic, rising and falling traffic.Down, down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep, sank, and was muffled over."
"头发灰白的保姆又继续织着毛衣，彼得·沃尔什坐在她旁边热乎乎的座位上打起了呼噜。　她穿着灰色衣裙，不厌其烦地、安静地动着双手，看上去仿佛是入睡者权利的守护者，是傍晚时分在苍穹与枝丫交织的树林中升起的幽灵。这个孤零零的旅徒，在小巷中出没，扰乱了厥草，蹂躏了大毒芹，他抬头望去，突然看见路的另一头出现一个硕大的身影。","The grey nurse resumed her knitting as Peter Walsh, on the hot seat beside her, began snoring.In her grey dress, moving her hands indefatigably yet quietly, she seemed like the champion of the rights of sleepers, like one of those spectral presences which rise in twilight in woods made of sky and branches.The solitary traveller, haunter of lanes, disturber of ferns, and devastator of great hemlock plants, looking up, suddenly sees the giant figure at the end of the ride."
"可能因为坚信自己是无神论者，片刻的异常兴奋令他感到格外惊讶。我们体外存在的只是一种精神状态，他想，是一种渴望，渴求慰藉、超脱，渴求某种这些微不足道的小人物、这些软弱的人、丑陋的人、怯懦的男男女女身上所没有的东西。可要是他能将她想象出来，那么她从某种意义上讲即是存在的，他想。继续沿小路走下去，他抬眼望着苍穹和树枝，很快赋予它们女人的气质。他吃惊地看着它们变得那么庄重，那么庄严。当微风轻拂它们时，随着叶子的微微颤动，它们施与仁慈、理解、饶恕。接着，她们忽地纵身向上，模糊了她们虔诚的一面，恣意狂欢。","By conviction an atheist perhaps, he is taken by surprise with moments of extraordinary exaltation.Nothing exists outside us except a state of mind, he thinks; a desire for solace, for relief, for something outside these miserable pigmies, these feeble, these ugly, these craven men and women.But if he can conceive of her, then in some sort she exists, he thinks, and advancing down the path with his eyes upon sky and branches he rapidly endows them with womanhood; sees with amazement how grave they become; how majestically, as the breeze stirs them, they dispense with a dark flutter of the leaves charity, comprehension, absolution, and then, flinging themselves suddenly aloft, confound the piety of their aspect with a wild carouse."
"这就是幻像，它提供给孤单的旅徒盛满水果的羊角形大口袋，或在他耳边呢喃，像海妖在绿色的海浪上跳跃，或像一束束玫瑰撞在他的脸上，或如浮出水面的、渔人们在浪涛中挣扎着要捧住的苍白面孔。","Such are the visions which proffer great cornucopias full of fruit to the solitary traveller, or murmur in his ear like sirens lolloping away on the green sea waves, or are dashed in his face like bunches of roses, or rise to the surface like pale faces which fishermen flounder through floods to embrace."
"就是这些幻像无休止地浮现，在真实的事物旁边踱来踱去，把它们的面孔置于真实的事物面前。它们经常令形单影只的旅徒难以抗拒，夺去他对于大地的意识、归来的渴望，取而代之的是给他一种大体的平静，就像（他沿着林中小径前行时如此思索着）这一切生之狂热是如此简单明了的事物。形形色色的事物融于一体；而这由苍穹和树枝织成的身影已从澎湃的大海中升起（他上了年纪，如今五十多岁了），宛若从海浪中可以吸出一个形体，经由她华贵的手倾注怜悯、理解、饶恕。所以，他想道，希望我永不返回那灯光下，不返回那客厅，永不看完我那本书，永不磕掉我烟斗里的烟灰，永不按铃让特纳太太来清扫，让我径直走向这伟大的身影，她会一抬头，把我安放于她的飘带上，使我与其余的一切灰飞烟灭。","Such are the visions which ceaselessly float up, pace beside, put their faces in front of, the actual thing; often overpowering the solitary traveller and taking away from him the sense of the earth, the wish to return, and giving him for substitute a general peace, as if (so he thinks as he advances down the forest ride) all this fever of living were simplicity itself; and myriads of things merged in one thing; and this figure, made of sky and branches as it is, had risen from the troubled sea (he is elderly, past fifty now) as a shape might be sucked up out of the waves to shower down from her magnificent hands compassion, comprehension, absolution.So, he thinks, may I never go back to the lamplight; to the sitting-room; never finish my book; never knock out my pipe; never ring for Mrs. Turner to clear away; rather let me walk straight on to this great figure, who will, with a toss of her head, mount me on her streamers and let me blow to nothingness with the rest."
"就是这些幻像。孤单的旅徒不久便离开了林地。那里，一位年迈的、眼神忧郁的妇人来到了门口，她举着双手，白色的围裙随风飘动，可能是在期盼着他的归来。她似乎（这个虚弱的人却是这般有力量）要在沙漠中找寻失去的儿子；要去搜寻一个被击败的骑士；要成为一个儿子都战死在世界战争中的母亲的形象。所以，孤单的旅徒顺着村庄街道往前走时，街边女人们站着编织，男人们在园圃里掘土，那个傍晚好像预示着不祥之象。那些身影纹丝不动，似乎某种他们知道的、无畏等候的、令人敬畏的命运要将他们一举彻底歼灭。","Such are the visions.The solitary traveller is soon beyond the wood; and there, coming to the door with shaded eyes, possibly to look for his return, with hands raised, with white apron blowing, is an elderly woman who seems (so powerful is this infirmity) to seek, over a desert, a lost son; to search for a rider destroyed; to be the figure of the mother whose sons have been killed in the battles of the world.So, as the solitary traveller advances down the village street where the women stand knitting and the men dig in the garden, the evening seems ominous; the figures still; as if some august fate, known to them, awaited without fear, were about to sweep them into complete annihilation."
"在屋内的橱柜、桌子、放着天竺葵的窗台这些普通的物件中，那俯身拿走桌布的女房东的轮廓忽然随着光线变得柔和起来，这是一个非常可爱的化身，只是想起的、冷淡的人际关系才阻止我们拥抱彼此。","Indoors among ordinary things, the cupboard, the table, the window-sill with its geraniums, suddenly the outline of the landlady, bending to remove the cloth, becomes soft with light, an adorable emblem which only the recollection of cold human contacts forbids us to embrace."
"她拿出橘子酱，放进了橱柜里。","She takes the marmalade; she shuts it in the cupboard."
"“今晚没什么事了吗，先生？”","“There is nothing more tonight, sir?”"
"可是那孤单的旅徒要应答谁呢？","But to whom does the solitary traveller make reply?"
"就这样，摄政公园里在睡着的婴儿旁那年迈的保姆在编织。就这样，彼得·沃尔什打着鼾。","So the elderly nurse knitted over the sleeping baby in Regent’s Park.So Peter Walsh snored."
"他冷不丁地猛然醒来，喃喃自语：“灵魂的死亡。”","He woke with extreme suddenness, saying to himself, “The death of the soul.”"
"“主啊，主啊！”他高声自言自语道，伸着懒腰，睁开双眼，“灵魂的死亡。”这只言片语与他梦到的某个场景、某个房间、某段往事密切相关。他梦到的那场景、那屋子、那往事愈发清晰起来。","“Lord, Lord!” he said to himself out loud, stretching and opening his eyes.“The death of the soul.”The words attached themselves to some scene, to some room, to some past he had been dreaming of.It became clearer; the scene, the room, the past he had been dreaming of."
"九十年代早期，那个伯顿的夏天，他狂热地爱着克拉丽莎。屋内人很多，有说有笑，吃过下午茶后围坐在桌边。房间沐浴在黄色的光线下，弥漫着香烟的烟雾。他们议论着附近一个娶自己女仆为妻的乡绅，他已经忘了那乡绅的名字。他和自己女仆结了婚，还带她到伯顿造访——一个糟糕的造访。她装扮过了头，太滑稽了，“像只白鹦。”克拉丽莎模仿她的模样说道，而且那女人总是说个没完。她说个不停，没完没了。克拉丽莎模仿她。接着有人说——萨莉·西顿——要是知道他们婚前，她就曾有个孩子，人们对她的看法就会真的有所改变吗？（在那个时候，在男女皆在场的情形下，说出这种话是很大胆的。）他至今都能想起克拉丽莎的样子，她的脸变得通红，有些抽搐，说：“噢，我再也不和她说话了！”这时，坐在茶桌旁的所有人都显出局促不安。那场景非常尴尬。","It was at Bourton that summer, early in the nineties, when he was so passionately in love with Clarissa.There were a great many people there, laughing and talking, sitting round a table after tea and the room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke.They were talking about a man who had married his housemaid, one of the neighbouring squires, he had forgotten his name.He had married his housemaid, and she had been brought to Bourton to call—an awful visit it had been.She was absurdly over-dressed, “like a cockatoo,” Clarissa had said, imitating her, and she never stopped talking.On and on she went, on and on.Clarissa imitated her.Then somebody said—Sally Seton it was—did it make any real difference to one’s feelings to know that before they’d married she had had a baby?(In those days, in mixed company, it was a bold thing to say.) He could see Clarissa now, turning bright pink; somehow contracting; and saying, “Oh, I shall never be able to speak to her again!”Whereupon the whole party sitting round the tea-table seemed to wobble.It was very uncomfortable."
"他没有因为她介意这种事而责怪她，因为那时像她一样成长在那种环境下的女孩对一切一无所知，但是她的态度令他不快，羞怯，冷酷、有些自负、无趣、过分拘谨。“灵魂的死亡。”他本能地说了出来，像惯常那样把这个时刻标定了下来——她的灵魂死了。","He hadn’t blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a girl brought up as she was, knew nothing, but it was her manner that annoyed him; timid; hard; something arrogant; unimaginative; prudish.“The death of the soul.”He had said that instinctively, ticketing the moment as he used to do—the death of her soul."
"每个人都局促不安，她说话时，每个人都像是在点头哈腰，但是站起来就变样了。他看到萨莉·西顿，活像一个调皮的孩子，身体前倾，脸变得通红，想说又不敢说，克拉丽莎的确能把人镇住。（她是克拉丽莎最亲密的朋友，总是到这里玩。她与克拉丽莎截然不同。她很漂亮迷人，皮肤黝黑。那时她因格外大胆而出名，他常给她雪茄吸，她就在自家卧室中抽烟。她或许是与某人订婚了，或许是与家里人吵架了，老帕里对她和克拉丽莎都很讨厌，这却加强了她俩的关系。）然后克拉丽莎站起来，依然挂着被所有人冒犯了的神情，找借口一个人离开了。她开门时，那条喜欢追赶羊群的大长毛犬跑了进来。她搂住它，异常欣喜。就好像她在对彼得说——这完全是针对他，他知道——“我知道你觉得我刚说的有关那个女人的话很荒谬，但你瞧我是多么富有同情心，瞧我多爱我的罗布！”","Every one wobbled; every one seemed to bow, as she spoke, and then to stand up different.He could see Sally Seton, like a child who has been in mischief, leaning forward, rather flushed, wanting to talk, but afraid, and Clarissa did frighten people.(She was Clarissa’s greatest friend, always about the place, totally unlike her, an attractive creature, handsome, dark, with the reputation in those days of great daring and he used to give her cigars, which she smoked in her bedroom.She had either been engaged to somebody or quarrelled with her family and old Parry disliked them both equally, which was a great bond.) Then Clarissa, still with an air of being offended with them all, got up, made some excuse, and went off, alone.As she opened the door, in came that great shaggy dog which ran after sheep.She flung herself upon him, went into raptures.It was as if she said to Peter—it was all aimed at him, he knew—“I know you thought me absurd about that woman just now; but see how extraordinarily sympathetic I am; see how I love my Rob!”"
"他俩之间一向就有这种不必说话便可交流的奇怪能力。她很快就知道他在批评她。因此她就会做某件事，明显为自己辩解，就像抱狗这样的小事——但这从来骗不过他，他总是能看透克拉丽莎。当然他什么也没说，只是闷闷不乐地坐在那里。他俩的争辩经常这样开始。","They had always this queer power of communicating without words.She knew directly he criticised her.Then she would do something quite obvious to defend herself, like this fuss with the dog—but it never took him in, he always saw through Clarissa.Not that he said anything, of course; just sat looking glum.It was the way their quarrels often began."
"她把门关上了。他立刻变得非常消沉。一切好像皆是徒劳——继续爱着；继续吵着；继续和解，他一个人在外屋与马房之间闲逛，看看马匹。（那地方很简陋，帕里一家从来也没有富裕过，不过也一直雇有马夫和马童——克拉丽莎喜欢骑马——还有一个年老的马车夫——他叫什么来着？——以及一个年老的保姆，他们叫她老穆迪、老古迪之类的名字，人们被领到一个有很多照片、很多鸟笼的小屋去拜访她。）","She shut the door.At once he became extremely depressed.It all seemed useless—going on being in love; going on quarrelling; going on making it up, and he wandered off alone, among outhouses, stables, looking at the horses.(The place was quite a humble one; the Parrys were never very well off; but there were always grooms and stable-boys about—Clarissa loved riding—and an old coachman—what was his name?—an old nurse, old Moody, old Goody, some such name they called her, whom one was taken to visit in a little room with lots of photographs, lots of bird-cages.)"
"真是一个糟糕的夜晚！他变得越来越消沉，不仅为那一件事，为所有事。但是他没法看到她，没法向她解释，没法说个清楚。身边一直有人——她得继续装作什么都没有发生过。这就是她的可恶之处——冷淡、漠不关心，这在她的性格深处已经根深蒂固。早上与她交谈时，他又感觉到了，无法穿透。然而天知道他是爱她的。她有某种奇怪的力量可以拨动你的神经，是的，把你的神经变成琴弦。","It was an awful evening!He grew more and more gloomy, not about that only; about everything.And he couldn’t see her; couldn’t explain to her; couldn’t have it out.There were always people about—she’d go on as if nothing had happened.That was the devilish part of her—this coldness, this woodenness, something very profound in her, which he had felt again this morning talking to her; an impenetrability.Yet Heaven knows he loved her.She had some queer power of fiddling on one’s nerves, turning one’s nerves to fiddle-strings, yes."
"出于某种想让人注意到他的愚蠢想法，他很晚才去用餐，他挨着年老的帕里小姐——海伦娜姑妈——帕里先生的姐姐坐下来，她来主持晚宴。她围着白色克什米尔披肩坐着，头靠着窗户——这是一位令人生畏的老妇人，可对他是友好的，因为他曾为她找到了某种罕见的花。而她是个热心的植物学家，经常穿着双厚靴子，肩上挎着一个黑色标本箱出外采集。他坐在她旁边，没有说话。一切似乎都从他身旁快速掠过，而他只是坐在那里，吃着东西。然后晚餐进行到一半时，他第一次迫使自己朝对面克拉丽莎瞟了一眼。她正与她右边的一个青年说话。彼得突然有一种预感。“她将嫁给那个男人。”他自言自语道。他甚至连那人的名字也不清楚。","He had gone in to dinner rather late, from some idiotic idea of making himself felt, and had sat down by old Miss Parry—Aunt Helena—Mr. Parry’s sister, who was supposed to preside.There she sat in her white Cashmere shawl, with her head against the window—a formidable old lady, but kind to him, for he had found her some rare flower, and she was a great botanist, marching off in thick boots with a black collecting-box slung between her shoulders.He sat down beside her, and couldn’t speak.Everything seemed to race past him; he just sat there, eating.And then half-way through dinner he made himself look across at Clarissa for the first time.She was talking to a young man on her right.He had a sudden revelation.“She will marry that man,” he said to himself.He didn’t even know his name."
"当然达洛维就是在那个下午，正是那天下午来访的，克拉丽莎称呼他“威克姆”；那就是一切的开始。有人带他来了，而克拉丽莎把他名字记错了。她向每个人介绍说他叫威克姆。最后他说道：“我叫达洛维！”——那就是彼得对理查德的初次印象——一位金发青年，非常不安地坐在折叠躺椅上，猛然说出“我叫达洛维”！萨莉记住了这件事，后来她老是唤他为“我叫达洛维”！","For of course it was that afternoon, that very afternoon, that Dalloway had come over; and Clarissa called him “Wickham”; that was the beginning of it all.Somebody had brought him over; and Clarissa got his name wrong.She introduced him to everybody as Wickham.At last he said “My name is Dalloway!”—that was his first view of Richard—a fair young man, rather awkward, sitting on a deck-chair, and blurting out “My name is Dalloway!”Sally got hold of it; always after that she called him “My name is Dalloway!”"
"那时彼得很容易受到各种神启的影响。而这一次——克拉丽莎将嫁给达洛维的启示——令他眩晕、茫然失措。他应怎样描述呢？她对他的态度中有几分闲适，几分母性，几分温柔。他们在议论政治。整个晚宴彼得都在设法听清他俩的对话。","He was a prey to revelations at that time.This one—that she would marry Dalloway—was blinding—overwhelming at the moment.There was a sort of—how could he put it?—a sort of ease in her manner to him; something maternal; something gentle.They were talking about politics.All through dinner he tried to hear what they were saying."
"然后他能忆起在客厅中自己站在老帕里小姐的椅子旁。克拉丽莎举止优雅地走了过来，好似一位真正的女主人，想向某人介绍达洛维——她说话的样子似乎他俩素未相识，这激怒了彼得。但即便那时他还是为此佩服她。他佩服她的勇气，她的社交天赋，他佩服她凡事进行到底的能力。“完美的女主人。”他向她说道，听后她浑身抽搐。不过他本就打算让她有这种感觉。看到她和达洛维在一起，他会做出任何事来伤害她。所以她离开了他。他觉得他们联合起来密谋与他作对——有说有笑——背着他。他就站在帕里小姐的椅子旁谈论野花，仿佛他是木雕似的。他从未、从未遭受过如此的痛苦！他甚至肯定是忘记了该装作聆听帕里小姐讲话。最后他醒过来，注意到帕里小姐情绪激动，非常愤怒，凸出的眼珠一动不动地盯着。他几乎要喊出来他不能专心是因为他正在地狱中煎熬。人们开始走出房间。他听他们说要去拿披风，说水面上很冷等等。他们打算在月光下泛舟湖上——这是萨莉的一个疯狂的想法。他可以听到萨莉描绘那轮月亮。然后他们都去了。他非常孤单地留下来了。","Afterwards he could remember standing by old Miss Parry’s chair in the drawing-room.Clarissa came up, with her perfect manners, like a real hostess, and wanted to introduce him to some one—spoke as if they had never met before, which enraged him.Yet even then he admired her for it.He admired her courage; her social instinct; he admired her power of carrying things through.“The perfect hostess,” he said to her, whereupon she winced all over.But he meant her to feel it.He would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her with Dalloway.So she left him.And he had a feeling that they were all gathered together in a conspiracy against him—laughing and talking—behind his back.There he stood by Miss Parry’s chair as though he had been cut out of wood, he talking about wild flowers.Never, never had he suffered so infernally!He must have forgotten even to pretend to listen; at last he woke up; he saw Miss Parry looking rather disturbed, rather indignant, with her prominent eyes fixed.He almost cried out that he couldn’t attend because he was in Hell!People began going out of the room.He heard them talking about fetching cloaks; about its being cold on the water, and so on.They were going boating on the lake by moonlight—one of Sally’s mad ideas.He could hear her describing the moon.And they all went out.He was left quite alone."
"“你不愿意与他们同去吗？”海伦娜姑妈问道——老帕里小姐！——她已经猜到了。他转过身，克拉丽莎又出现了。她返回来是叫他的。他被她的宽容征服了——还有她的善良。","“Don’t you want to go with them?” said Aunt Helena—old Miss Parry!—she had guessed.And he turned round and there was Clarissa again.She had come back to fetch him.He was overcome by her generosity—her goodness."
"“走吧，”她说道，“他们在等呢。”他一生中从未感到如此快乐过！不著一言他俩就和解了。他俩步行到湖边。他有二十分钟是极度快乐的。她的声音、笑容、衣裙（飘拂着，红白相间），她的活力、无畏的精神；她让大伙上岸，去那个岛屿上探险；她惊动了一只母鸡，她笑着，唱着。他一直就知道得很清楚，达洛维爱上了她，她爱上了达洛维。可是这好像并没什么关系。全都没关系。他俩坐在地上说话——他和克拉丽莎。他俩很轻松地就交流了各自的想法。然后一切在一瞬间就完结了。他俩登上船时他笨拙地自言自语道：“她将嫁给那个人。”他没有丝毫忌恨，不过这是一件明显的事。达洛维将和克拉丽莎结婚。","“Come along,” she said.“They’re waiting.”He had never felt so happy in the whole of his life!Without a word they made it up.They walked down to the lake.He had twenty minutes of perfect happiness.Her voice, her laugh, her dress (something floating, white, crimson), her spirit, her adventurousness; she made them all disembark and explore the island; she startled a hen; she laughed; she sang.And all the time, he knew perfectly well, Dalloway was falling in love with her; she was falling in love with Dalloway; but it didn’t seem to matter.Nothing mattered.They sat on the ground and talked—he and Clarissa.They went in and out of each other’s minds without any effort.And then in a second it was over.He said to himself as they were getting into the boat, “She will marry that man,” dully, without any resentment; but it was an obvious thing.Dalloway would marry Clarissa."
"达洛维把他们划了回去。他什么也没说。可是不知怎么回事，当他们注视着他蹬上自行车，开始穿越森林的二十里路程程，在车道上颠簸前行，挥了挥手后逐渐消失时，他真的明显感觉到了，本能地、惊人地、强烈地感觉到那一切，那晚，那浪漫，克拉丽莎。达洛维值得拥有她。","Dalloway rowed them in.He said nothing.But somehow as they watched him start, jumping on to his bicycle to ride twenty miles through the woods, wobbling off down the drive, waving his hand and disappearing, he obviously did feel, instinctively, tremendously, strongly, all that; the night; the romance; Clarissa.He deserved to have her."
"至于他自己，他是荒谬的。他对克拉丽莎的要求（他如今明白）是荒谬的。他要求办不到的事。他激烈地吵闹着。或许她依然会接受他，要是他不那么荒谬的话。萨莉认为如此。那整个夏季萨莉都给他写很长的信，说他们是怎样议论他，她是怎样赞美他，克拉丽莎是怎样突然哭了起来！这是个非同寻常的夏季——都是信件、吵闹、电报——他一大早就到了伯顿，闲逛着直到佣人们起床。真可怕——早饭时坐在老帕里先生对面；海伦娜姑妈令人生畏却很和蔼；萨莉拉他到菜园子说话；克拉丽莎因头疼躺在床上。","For himself, he was absurd.His demands upon Clarissa (he could see it now) were absurd.He asked impossible things.He made terrible scenes.She would have accepted him still, perhaps, if he had been less absurd.Sally thought so.She wrote him all that summer long letters; how they had talked of him; how she had praised him, how Clarissa burst into tears!It was an extraordinary summer—all letters, scenes, telegrams—arriving at Bourton early in the morning, hanging about till the servants were up; appalling tote－totters with old Mr. Parry at breakfast; Aunt Helena formidable but kind; Sally sweeping him off for talks in the vegetable garden; Clarissa in bed with headaches."
"最后一次吵闹发生于一个炎热的下午三点，他认为这次可怕的吵闹在他整个生命中关系最为重大（或许有点夸张——可是如今好像依旧是这样）。一件琐事导致了这次吵闹——萨莉在午餐时谈论到达洛维，并唤他为“我的名字叫达洛维”，于是克拉丽莎忽然身体僵硬，脸变通红，用她自己的方式尖锐地脱口而出：“我们受够了那无聊的玩笑。”就只有这句话，可对他来说，仿佛她恰恰是在说：“我只是和你逗着玩，我与理查德·达洛维之间心有灵犀。”他就是如此领会的。　他几夜都睡不着。“这事无论怎样都要解决。”他自言自语。他让萨莉带给她一封短信，约她三点在喷泉相见。他在信的结尾潦草地写道：“有件非常重要的事发生了。”","The final scene, the terrible scene which he believed had mattered more than anything in the whole of his life (it might be an exaggeration—but still so it did seem now) happened at three o’clock in the afternoon of a very hot day.It was a trifle that led up to it—Sally at lunch saying something about Dalloway, and calling him “My name is Dalloway”; whereupon Clarissa suddenly stiffened, coloured, in a way she had, and rapped out sharply, “We’ve had enough of that feeble joke.”That was all; but for him it was precisely as if she had said, “I’m only amusing myself with you; I’ve an understanding with Richard Dalloway.”So he took it.He had not slept for nights.“It’s got to be finished one way or the other,” he said to himself.He sent a note to her by Sally asking her to meet him by the fountain at three.“Something very important has happened,” he scribbled at the end of it."
"喷泉在一个小灌木林中央，离房屋很远，周围全是灌木和树木。她去了，甚至还提前到了，他们隔着喷泉站着，喷泉口（破裂了）不停冒着水。那些景象是多么深刻地印在脑中啊！例如，那栩栩如生的青苔。","The fountain was in the middle of a little shrubbery, far from the house, with shrubs and trees all round it.There she came, even before the time, and they stood with the fountain between them, the spout (it was broken) dribbling water incessantly.How sights fix themselves upon the mind!For example, the vivid green moss."
"她站着不动。“对我说实话，对我说实话。”他不住地说着。他觉得自己的额头似乎要爆炸了。她看起来缩成一团，吓呆了。她站着不动。“对我说实话。”他反复说着。这时，那个老人布赖特科普夫忽然拿出《泰晤士报》探进头来，盯了他们一眼，张大着嘴，然后离开了。他俩都站着不动。“对我说实话。”他反复说。他觉得他在磨砺什么坚固的东西，她毫不屈服。她如铁，如火石，挺直了脊梁。后来她说：“没用的。没用的。我们的关系结束了。”——他的眼泪沿双颊滑落，他似乎说了好几小时——似乎她在他脸上扇了耳光。她转身撇下他，离去了。","She did not move.“Tell me the truth, tell me the truth,” he kept on saying.He felt as if his forehead would burst.She seemed contracted, petrified.She did not move.“Tell me the truth,” he repeated, when suddenly that old man Breitkopf popped his head in carrying the Times; stared at them; gaped; and went away.They neither of them moved.“Tell me the truth,” he repeated.He felt that he was grinding against something physically hard; she was unyielding.She was like iron, like flint, rigid up the backbone.And when she said, “It’s no use.It’s no use.This is the end”—after he had spoken for hours, it seemed, with the tears running down his cheeks—it was as if she had hit him in the face.She turned, she left him, went away."
"“克拉丽莎！”他大喊，“克拉丽莎！”可是她没再回来过。结束了。那晚他就离去了。他从未再见过她。","“Clarissa!” he cried. “Clarissa!”But she never came back.It was over.He went away that night.He never saw her again."
"这真是糟糕，他大喊，糟糕，糟糕！","It was awful, he cried, awful, awful!"
"不过，阳光还是热乎乎的。人们仍会从往事中恢复。生活仍一天天地过着。他想，打着哈欠，开始留意到周围——摄政公园从他儿时到现在仍没有多大变化，除了这些松鼠——不过应该有些补偿吧——小埃莉斯·米切尔一直在拣卵石来添置到她和哥哥的卵石收藏中，他们把卵石放在育婴室的壁炉架上，这时她忽然在保姆膝上放了一把卵石后飞跑开，又撞上了一个女人的腿。彼得·沃尔什哈哈大笑。","Still, the sun was hot.Still, one got over things.Still, life had a way of adding day to day.Still, he thought, yawning and beginning to take notice—Regent’s Park had changed very little since he was a boy, except for the squirrels—still, presumably there were compensations—when little Elise Mitchell, who had been picking up pebbles to add to the pebble collection which she and her brother were making on the nursery mantelpiece, plumped her handful down on the nurse’s knee and scudded off again full tilt into a lady’s legs.Peter Walsh laughed out."
"不过卢克雷齐娅·沃伦·史密斯喃喃自语道，真可恶，为何要我遭罪呢？她一边自问，一边在一条宽阔的小路走着。不行，我不能再忍下去，她这样说着，离开了塞普蒂默斯。而他再不是塞普蒂默斯了，他坐在那里的座位上说着冷漠、残酷、恶劣的话语，喃喃自语，和一个死人说话。此时那小女孩迎面撞过来，摔倒在地，大哭了起来。","But Lucrezia Warren Smith was saying to herself, It’s wicked; why should I suffer?She was asking, as she walked down the broad path.No; I can’t stand it any longer, she was saying, having left Septimus, who wasn’t Septimus any longer, to say hard, cruel, wicked things, to talk to himself, to talk to a dead man, on the seat over there; when the child ran full tilt into her, fell flat, and burst out crying."
"这却使她欣慰。她把小孩扶起来，拍拍她的外衣，亲了亲她。","That was comforting rather.She stood her upright, dusted her frock, kissed her."
"然而对她自己来说，她没犯过什么错。她爱过塞普蒂默斯，她曾快乐过，她曾有一个美丽的家，她的姊妹仍在那个家里，做着帽子。为何她该遭罪呢？","But for herself she had done nothing wrong; she had loved Septimus; she had been happy; she had had a beautiful home, and there her sisters lived still, making hats.Why should SHE suffer?"
"这小孩径直跑回到保姆那里，雷齐娅看到保姆先是责骂她，然后抚慰她，放下手中的编织，把她抱起来。一个看上去很友好的男子把他的手表递给她打开来玩，以此安慰她——然而为何她雷齐娅就无人关心呢？为何不留在米兰？为何要折磨我？为何啊？","The child ran straight back to its nurse, and Rezia saw her scolded, comforted, taken up by the nurse who put down her knitting, and the kind-looking man gave her his watch to blow open to comfort her—but why should SHE be exposed?Why not left in Milan?Why tortured?Why?"
"泪水微微模糊了小路、保姆、穿着灰色衣服的男人、婴儿车。这些东西在她眼前起起伏伏。她将任这邪恶的虐待者摆布是命中注定的事。但为何呢？她就如一只小鸟，在树叶浅浅的凹处躲避着。树叶动时，它会被惊吓到，朝着太阳眨眼；一根干树枝断裂也会吓到它。她无所蔽体，被淡漠世间的参天大树和无边的云朵所包围，无依无靠，蒙受折磨，为何她该遭罪呢？为何啊？","Slightly waved by tears the broad path, the nurse, the man in grey, the perambulator, rose and fell before her eyes.To be rocked by this malignant torturer was her lot.But why?She was like a bird sheltering under the thin hollow of a leaf, who blinks at the sun when the leaf moves; starts at the crack of a dry twig.She was exposed; she was surrounded by the enormous trees, vast clouds of an indifferent world, exposed; tortured; and why should she suffer?Why?"
"她蹙额，她跺脚。她必须要再回到塞普蒂默斯那里，因为他们去威廉·布拉德肖爵士那里的时间就要到了。她必须要回去告诉他，回到坐在树下绿色椅子上自言自语，或是跟死人埃文斯说话的他那里。她仅在商店中匆匆见过埃文斯一面。他看起来是一个善良安静的人，是塞普蒂默斯的好友，死于战争。然而这样的事情人人身上都会发生。人人都有朋友死于战争。人人结婚时都放会放弃一些东西。她割舍了她的家。她来到这里居住，这个糟糕的城市。然而塞普蒂默斯任由自己想那些可怕的事，如果她愿意，也能如此。他已经变得愈来愈奇怪了。他说有人在卧室的墙背后说话。菲尔默夫人认为这很奇怪。他还有幻觉——他曾见过一棵蕨树的中间有一颗老妇人的头。可要是他愿意，他是可以快乐的。他们坐在公共汽车上层到汉普顿宫玩，他们玩得特别尽兴。草坪上盛开了红色和黄色的小花，他说宛如浮动的灯，他说着、聊着、笑着，编着故事。忽然间他说道：“我们此刻就要自杀。”此时，他们正在河边站着，他凝视着河水，那眼神她在他的眼里见过，当一辆火车或者公共汽车路过时他的眼神即是如此——那眼神仿佛是有什么迷住了他，而她感到他正离开她，她就抓住了他的手臂。可是回家的路上他很平静——非常理智。他会与她争辩关于自杀的事，会解释人们是多么邪恶，还说在他们穿过大街时，他是如何能看出他们编造谎言的。他说他知道他们所有的想法，他明白一切。他说他知道世界的含义。","She frowned; she stamped her foot.She must go back again to Septimus since it was almost time for them to be going to Sir William Bradshaw.She must go back and tell him, go back to him sitting there on the green chair under the tree, talking to himself, or to that dead man Evans, whom she had only seen once for a moment in the shop.He had seemed a nice quiet man; a great friend of Septimus’s, and he had been killed in the War.But such things happen to every one.Every one has friends who were killed in the War.Every one gives up something when they marry.She had given up her home.She had come to live here, in this awful city.But Septimus let himself think about horrible things, as she could too, if she tried.He had grown stranger and stranger.He said people were talking behind the bedroom walls.Mrs. Filmer thought it odd.He saw things too—he had seen an old woman’s head in the middle of a fern.Yet he could be happy when he chose.They went to Hampton Court on top of a bus, and they were perfectly happy.All the little red and yellow flowers were out on the grass, like floating lamps he said, and talked and chattered and laughed, making up stories.Suddenly he said, “Now we will kill ourselves,” when they were standing by the river, and he looked at it with a look which she had seen in his eyes when a train went by, or an omnibus—a look as if something fascinated him; and she felt he was going from her and she caught him by the arm.But going home he was perfectly quiet—perfectly reasonable.He would argue with her about killing themselves; and explain how wicked people were; how he could see them making up lies as they passed in the street.He knew all their thoughts, he said; he knew everything.He knew the meaning of the world, he said."
"然后他们回去后，他几乎不能走路。他在沙发上躺着，让她握住他的手，以防他从沙发上滑下去，滑下去，掉进火里，他大喊！他看到墙上有一些面孔在笑话他，用可怕恶心的话语咒骂他，屏风四周伸出一些手臂对他指指点点。然而他们周围根本就没有别人。但是他开始大声说话，答复别人，争论，又哭又笑，异常激动，还让她记下这些事。尽是胡言乱语，有关死亡，有关伊莎贝尔·波尔小姐。她不能再忍下去了。她要回去。","Then when they got back he could hardly walk.He lay on the sofa and made her hold his hand to prevent him from falling down, down, he cried, into the flames!And saw faces laughing at him, calling him horrible disgusting names, from the walls, and hands pointing round the screen.Yet they were quite alone.But he began to talk aloud, answering people, arguing, laughing, crying, getting very excited and making her write things down.Perfect nonsense it was; about death; about Miss Isabel Pole.She could stand it no longer.She would go back."
"现在她离他很近，可以看到他凝视苍穹，紧握拳头，轻声低语着。然而霍姆斯医生说他没有什么病。后来究竟发生了什么？他为何离开？又是为何在她挨着他坐下的时候，他吃了一惊，对着她蹙额，走开了，又指着她的手，拿过来害怕地注视着？","She was close to him now, could see him staring at the sky, muttering, clasping his hands.Yet Dr. Holmes said there was nothing the matter with him.What then had happened—why had he gone, then, why, when she sat by him, did he start, frown at her, move away, and point at her hand, take her hand, look at it terrified?"
"是不是因为她取下了婚戒呢？“我的手变得这么瘦了。”她说。“我把戒指放提包里了。”她对他说。","Was it that she had taken off her wedding ring?“My hand has grown so thin,” she said.“I have put it in my purse,” she told him."
"他松开她的手。他俩的婚姻结束了，他想，带着苦痛，又觉得轻松。绳子被割断了，他上了马，他自由了，像是命中注定，他，塞普蒂默斯，人类的上帝，应是自由的。孑然一身（因为他的妻子把她的婚戒扔了，因为她已经离他而去），他，塞普蒂默斯，孤身一人，在众人中首先被唤去倾听真谛，领悟真理，如今终于在一切文明的跋涉之后——希腊人、罗马人、莎士比亚、达尔文，如今又有他自己——将要完整地给予……“给予谁？”他高声发问。“给予首相。”他头上沙沙的声音答道。这绝密一定得告知内阁。首先树是有生命的；其次，没有罪行；第三是爱，博爱。他轻声低语着，喘着气，战栗着，痛苦地说出这些深奥的真谛，它们那么深刻，那么艰涩，需要极大的努力才能说出，然而这世界却因它们而永远改变。","He dropped her hand.Their marriage was over, he thought, with agony, with relief.The rope was cut; he mounted; he was free, as it was decreed that he, Septimus, the lord of men, should be free; alone (since his wife had thrown away her wedding ring; since she had left him), he, Septimus, was alone, called forth in advance of the mass of men to hear the truth, to learn the meaning, which now at last, after all the toils of civilisation—Greeks, Romans, Shakespeare, Darwin, and now himself—was to be given whole to....“To whom?” he asked aloud.“To the Prime Minister,” the voices which rustled above his head replied.The supreme secret must be told to the Cabinet; first that trees are alive; next there is no crime; next love, universal love, he muttered, gasping, trembling, painfully drawing out these profound truths which needed, so deep were they, so difficult, an immense effort to speak out, but the world was entirely changed by them for ever."
"没有犯罪，爱，他反复说着，一边摸索着他的卡片与铅笔。这时，一条斯凯狗（一种苏格兰长毛短腿猎犬）嗅了嗅他的裤子，他吓了一跳，十分害怕。它正变成一个人！他无法眼见这样的事发生！真可怕，眼见一条狗变成人真是可怕！随即那条狗就跑掉了。","No crime; love; he repeated, fumbling for his card and pencil, when a Skye terrier snuffed his trousers and he started in an agony of fear.It was turning into a man!He could not watch it happen!It was horrible, terrible to see a dog become a man!At once the dog trotted away."
"上帝神圣仁慈，无比和善。它饶恕了他，原谅了他的缺陷。可科学是怎么解释的呢（因为人首先得讲科学）？为什么他可以透视躯体，看到将来，看到狗会变成人？大概是热浪影响了历经千百万年的进化而变得敏感的大脑。从科学的角度来讲，肉体从世间融化掉了。他的躯体浸软了，直到仅剩下神经纤维。它就如一张纱曼铺在岩石上。","Heaven was divinely merciful, infinitely benignant.It spared him, pardoned his weakness.But what was the scientific explanation (for one must be scientific above all things)?Why could he see through bodies, see into the future, when dogs will become men?It was the heat wave presumably, operating upon a brain made sensitive by eons of evolution.Scientifically speaking, the flesh was melted off the world.His body was macerated until only the nerve fibres were left.It was spread like a veil upon a rock."
"他背靠椅子，疲惫却受到鼓舞。他一动不动地靠在那里，等候着，然后他又费力地、悲痛地向人类阐述。他高高地靠在世界的脊背上。大地在他脚下震颤。红色的花朵穿过他的身体，绽放出来，它们僵硬的叶子在他的头边簌簌作响。音乐开始撞击这里的岩石，叮当作响。这是下面街上一辆汽车的喇叭声，他低声说道。可是在这高处，那声音在岩石之间发出轰鸣，分散，又聚集成声波，形成光滑的圆柱向上升起（音乐是可见的，这是一个大发现），变为一曲颂歌。此刻这颂歌与一个牧羊童的笛音融合在一起（那实际是一位老人在酒馆门口吹玩具哨子，他咕哝道），这孩子静静站立时，乐声从笛子里汩汩流出，接着当他爬得更高时，笛音哀婉凄美，而此时车辆在他身下穿梭。这男孩的哀歌融合在车马声中，塞普蒂默斯这样想着。此刻他隐退入雪山中，玫瑰悬挂在他身边——那是生长在我卧室墙上的茂盛的红玫瑰，他提醒自己。音乐停下来了。他推测，那老人拿了他的便士，去了另一家酒馆。","He lay back in his chair, exhausted but upheld.He lay resting, waiting, before he again interpreted, with effort, with agony, to mankind.He lay very high, on the back of the world.The earth thrilled beneath him.Red flowers grew through his flesh; their stiff leaves rustled by his head.Music began clanging against the rocks up here.It is a motor horn down in the street, he muttered; but up here it cannoned from rock to rock, divided, met in shocks of sound which rose in smooth columns (that music should be visible was a discovery) and became an anthem, an anthem twined round now by a shepherd boy’s piping (That’s an old man playing a penny whistle by the public-house, he muttered) which, as the boy stood still came bubbling from his pipe, and then, as he climbed higher, made its exquisite plaint while the traffic passed beneath.This boy’s elegy is played among the traffic, thought Septimus.Now he withdraws up into the snows, and roses hang about him—the thick red roses which grow on my bedroom wall, he reminded himself.The music stopped.He has his penny, he reasoned it out, and has gone on to the next public-house."
"可他自己依然高高地呆在岩石上，像一个溺死的水手躺在一块礁石上。我把身子从船边探出去，掉入水中，他心想。我沉到了海底。我曾经死过，可如今又活过来了，不过让我仍然安歇吧。他恳求道（他又自言自语了——真糟糕，糟糕啊）。就好像在苏醒之前，鸟鸣与车轮声交汇成一种古怪但却和谐的声音，这声音越来越大，沉睡者觉得自己被引向生命的彼岸，塞普蒂默斯也觉得自己被引向生活，太阳越来越热，呼喊声越来越大，有什么大事就要发生了。","But he himself remained high on his rock, like a drowned sailor on a rock.I leant over the edge of the boat and fell down, he thought.I went under the sea.I have been dead, and yet am now alive, but let me rest still; he begged (he was talking to himself again—it was awful, awful!); and as, before waking, the voices of birds and the sound of wheels chime and chatter in a queer harmony, grow louder and louder and the sleeper feels himself drawing to the shores of life, so he felt himself drawing towards life, the sun growing hotter, cries sounding louder, something tremendous about to happen."
"他只需要睁开双眼，可眼睛受到了压力，一种畏惧。他用力，他使劲，他睁开眼睛，看见眼前的摄政公园。长长饰带般的阳光在他脚边玩耍。树在摇动、起舞。我们欢迎，世界仿佛在说，我们接受，我们创造。世界仿佛在说，美。好像要证明这点（科学地），不论他瞧见的是宅子、栏杆、还是头探出木栅栏的羚羊，美都会瞬间跃出。留意一片叶子在风中颤抖是件非常开心的事。高空中燕子在俯冲、急转、迅速地飞进飞出、缭绕萦回，然而却始终控制得很完美，像是有松紧带牵着它们似的。苍蝇飞起飞落。阳光嘲弄地一会儿照在这片树叶上，一会儿照在那片树叶上，心情愉快地用柔和的金光把叶子照得闪闪发亮。时而某种钟声（或许是汽车喇叭声）在草茎上发出美妙的叮当声——这一切就是现在的真理，如此宁静而适度，虽由平凡之物生成，却是此刻的真理。美，就是此刻的真理。美无处不有。","He had only to open his eyes; but a weight was on them; a fear.He strained; he pushed; he looked; he saw Regent’s Park before him.Long streamers of sunlight fawned at his feet.The trees waved, brandished.We welcome, the world seemed to say; we accept; we create.Beauty, the world seemed to say.And as if to prove it (scientifically) wherever he looked at the houses, at the railings, at the antelopes stretching over the palings, beauty sprang instantly.To watch a leaf quivering in the rush of air was an exquisite joy.Up in the sky swallows swooping, swerving, flinging themselves in and out, round and round, yet always with perfect control as if elastics held them; and the flies rising and falling; and the sun spotting now this leaf, now that, in mockery, dazzling it with soft gold in pure good temper; and now and again some chime (it might be a motor horn) tinkling divinely on the grass stalks—all of this, calm and reasonable as it was, made out of ordinary things as it was, was the truth now; beauty, that was the truth now.Beauty was everywhere."
"“时间到了。”雷齐娅说。","“It is time,” said Rezia."
"“时间”这个词裂开外壳，把自己的财富倾倒在他身上。从他的嘴唇自然而然地滑落出坚贞的、纯洁的、不朽的词语，似弹壳、似刨床上的刨花，它们飞去组成了一首时间的颂歌，一首永恒的时间颂歌。他唱起歌来。埃文斯从树后回应。埃文斯歌唱着，死者在色萨利，在兰花丛中。他们一直在那里等到战事终止，而现在的死者，现在的埃文斯本人——","The word “time” split its husk; poured its riches over him; and from his lips fell like shells, like shavings from a plane, without his making them, hard, white, imperishable words, and flew to attach themselves to their places in an ode to Time; an immortal ode to Time.He sang.Evans answered from behind the tree.The dead were in Thessaly, Evans sang, among the orchids.There they waited till the War was over, and now the dead, now Evans himself—"
"“看在上帝的面上，不要过来！”塞普蒂默斯大声喊道。因为他不能面对死者。","“For God’s sake don’t come!” Septimus cried out.For he could not look upon the dead."
"然而枝条却分开来。一个穿着灰衣服的男人真的向他们走来。是埃文斯！不过他身上没有泥，没有伤痕。他没变。我必须告诉全世界，塞普蒂默斯大喊着，举起他的手（穿着灰衣服的死者走得更近），犹如巨人一样举起手，千百年来孤独地在沙漠中哀悼人类的命运，双手压住前额，脸上刻着绝望的皱纹，此刻他看见沙漠边缘的光亮在扩大，照在那铁黑色的身影上（塞普蒂默斯从椅上起身），无数人匍匐在他身后，而他，哀悼的巨人，他的脸顷刻间接纳了全部的——","But the branches parted.A man in grey was actually walking towards them.It was Evans!But no mud was on him; no wounds; he was not changed.I must tell the whole world, Septimus cried, raising his hand (as the dead man in the grey suit came nearer), raising his hand like some colossal figure who has lamented the fate of man for ages in the desert alone with his hands pressed to his forehead, furrows of despair on his cheeks, and now sees light on the desert’s edge which broadens and strikes the iron-black figure (and Septimus half rose from his chair), and with legions of men prostrate behind him he, the giant mourner, receives for one moment on his face the whole—"
"“可我是如此不快乐，塞普蒂默斯。”雷齐娅一边说一边试着让他坐下。","“But I am so unhappy, Septimus,” said Rezia trying to make him sit down."
"数百万的人哀悼着，千百万年来他们都很悲痛。他会转身，他会在片刻之后告诉他们，仅再需片刻，他会告知这慰藉、这乐趣、这令人惊讶的启示——","The millions lamented; for ages they had sorrowed.He would turn round, he would tell them in a few moments, only a few moments more, of this relief, of this joy, of this astonishing revelation—"
"“时间，塞普蒂默斯。”雷齐娅反复问道。“几点了？”","“The time, Septimus,” Rezia repeated.“What is the time?”"
"他在谈话，他很吃惊，这人肯定留意他了。他注视着他们。","He was talking, he was starting, this man must notice him.He was looking at them."
"“我会告知你时间的。”塞普蒂默斯说，语速极其缓慢，极其慵懒，还诡秘地笑着。他坐着，对穿灰衣服的死者微笑，一刻钟的钟声响起——还有一刻钟到十二点。","“I will tell you the time,” said Septimus, very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously.As he sat smiling at the dead man in the grey suit the quarter struck—the quarter to twelve."
"彼得·沃尔什从他们旁边走过时想，青年人就是那样的。上午才过一半就出现可怕的吵闹——这可怜的女孩看上去是完全绝望了。可是出什么事了，他疑惑不解，那穿大衣的青年跟她说什么了，以至于她脸色变成那样。在那样明媚的夏日清晨，他俩将自己卷入了怎样糟糕的窘境，使两人都看起来都那么绝望？五年后重返英国，最有趣的是一切都变得似乎以前未曾见过般惹人注目，至少前几天是这样。爱人在树下拌嘴，公园中充满了家庭生活的景象。他从没见过伦敦这么令人着迷——远景柔和，丰富多彩，翠意盎然，这就是文明，尤其是从印度回来后，穿过草地，他想着。","And that is being young, Peter Walsh thought as he passed them.To be having an awful scene—the poor girl looked absolutely desperate—in the middle of the morning.But what was it about, he wondered, what had the young man in the overcoat been saying to her to make her look like that; what awful fix had they got themselves into, both to look so desperate as that on a fine summer morning?The amusing thing about coming back to England, after five years, was the way it made, anyhow the first days, things stand out as if one had never seen them before; lovers squabbling under a tree; the domestic family life of the parks.Never had he seen London look so enchanting—the softness of the distances; the richness; the greenness; the civilisation, after India, he thought, strolling across the grass."
"无疑，这般易受观感影响一直都是他的致命缺点。在他那个年龄，他仍然像男孩甚至像女孩那样情绪不定。没有任何理由地得意失意。见到可爱的脸蛋就觉得幸福，见到邋遢的女子就觉得异常痛苦。从印度回来后，一个人当然对每个见过的女子都心生爱慕。她们散发出一股青春的朝气。即使是最贫穷的女人也肯定比五年前打扮得更好。在他眼里，时尚的款式从未如此好看过。长长的黑色披风，苗条的身段，典雅的气质，还有那怡人的、明显普遍存在的化妆习惯。每个女人，就算是最体面的女人，也有如温室里开放的玫瑰般的脸蛋，如刀刻般的嘴唇，墨汁般黑的鬈发，设计和艺术处处可见。无疑某种变化已经产生了。青年们怎么想的呢？彼得·沃尔什自问道。","This susceptibility to impressions had been his undoing no doubt.Still at his age he had, like a boy or a girl even, these alternations of mood; good days, bad days, for no reason whatever, happiness from a pretty face, downright misery at the sight of a frump.After India of course one fell in love with every woman one met.There was a freshness about them; even the poorest dressed better than five years ago surely; and to his eye the fashions had never been so becoming; the long black cloaks; the slimness; the elegance; and then the delicious and apparently universal habit of paint.Every woman, even the most respectable, had roses blooming under glass; lips cut with a knife; curls of Indian ink; there was design, art, everywhere; a change of some sort had undoubtedly taken place.What did the young people think about?Peter Walsh asked himself."
"他猜想，那五年——自一九一八至一九二三年——不知何故是很重要的。人们看起来不一样了。报纸好像也不同了。例如，此刻有个男人在一份体面的周报上相当公开地谈起抽水马桶来。那是十年前不允许的事——公开地在体面的周报上谈抽水马桶。然后就是在众目睽睽下取出口红或粉扑，化妆打扮。回国的船上有很多年轻的男女——他尤其记得的是贝蒂和伯蒂——公然调情。年老的母亲坐着注视他们，一面从容不迫地编织。那姑娘在每个人面前都会静静站着，在鼻子上扑粉。他们并没订婚，仅仅寻开心而已，两方情感都不会受伤。她是冷漠的——那个名叫什么贝蒂的——可她是一个十足的好人。她三十岁时会成为一位好妻子——在适当的时候她会嫁人，嫁个有钱人，住进曼彻斯特旁边的大房子里。","Those five years—1918 to 1923—had been, he suspected, somehow very important.People looked different.Newspapers seemed different.Now for instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the respectable weeklies about water-closets.That you couldn’t have done ten years ago—written quite openly about water-closets in a respectable weekly.And then this taking out a stick of rouge, or a powder-puff and making up in public.On board ship coming home there were lots of young men and girls—Betty and Bertie he remembered in particular—carrying on quite openly; the old mother sitting and watching them with her knitting, cool as a cucumber.The girl would stand still and powder her nose in front of every one.And they weren’t engaged; just having a good time; no feelings hurt on either side.As hard as nails she was—Betty What’shername—; but a thorough good sort.She would make a very good wife at thirty—she would marry when it suited her to marry; marry some rich man and live in a large house near Manchester."
"现在谁是那样做的？彼得·沃尔什兀自思量，转身走到大路上——嫁个有钱人，住进曼彻斯特旁边的大房子里。那个人最近写给他一封热情洋溢的长信，关于“蓝色的绣球花”。她见到蓝色绣球花就想起了他与昔日往事——萨莉·西顿，当然！那是萨莉·西顿——谁都不会想到她竟会和一个有钱人结婚，住进曼彻斯特旁边的大房子，那野性、勇敢、传奇的萨莉！","Who was it now who had done that?Peter Walsh asked himself, turning into the Broad Walk,—married a rich man and lived in a large house near Manchester?Somebody who had written him a long, gushing letter quite lately about “blue hydrangeas.”It was seeing blue hydrangeas that made her think of him and the old days—Sally Seton, of course!It was Sally Seton—the last person in the world one would have expected to marry a rich man and live in a large house near Manchester, the wild, the daring, the romantic Sally!"
"可是在过去认识的所有人里，在克拉丽莎的朋友里——惠特布雷德一家、金德利一家、坎宁安一家、金洛克-琼斯一家——萨莉可能是最好的。不论怎样，她试着用正确的方法来处理事情。无论如何，她看透了休·惠特布雷德——那令人称赞的休——那时克拉丽莎和其他人都拜在他脚下。","But of all that ancient lot, Clarissa’s friends—Whitbreads, Kinderleys, Cunninghams, Kinloch-Jones’s—Sally was probably the best.She tried to get hold of things by the right end anyhow.She saw through Hugh Whitbread anyhow—the admirable Hugh—when Clarissa and the rest were at his feet."
"“是惠特布雷德一家？”他可以听到她的话。“惠特布雷德家的人是干什么的？煤炭商。体面的商人。”","“The Whitbreads?” he could hear her saying.“Who are the Whitbreads?Coal merchants.Respectable tradespeople.”"
"因为某个缘由她痛恨休。他只想到自己的外表，她说。他应是一位公爵。他一定会与某位王室公主结婚。当然，休对他曾遇到的任何英国贵族有最独特、最本能、最崇高的尊重。甚至是克拉丽莎也得承认这一点。噢，可是他是个那么可爱的人，如此地无私，放弃狩猎来讨好他年迈的母亲——牢记着他姨妈们的生日，等等。","Hugh she detested for some reason.He thought of nothing but his own appearance, she said.He ought to have been a Duke.He would be certain to marry one of the Royal Princesses.And of course Hugh had the most extraordinary, the most natural, the most sublime respect for the British aristocracy of any human being he had ever come across.Even Clarissa had to own that.Oh, but he was such a dear, so unselfish, gave up shooting to please his old mother—remembered his aunts’ birthdays, and so on."
"公道地来讲，萨莉把那一切都看透了。他记忆中最清晰的事情之一就是有关女士权利的争吵，发生在伯顿的一个星期天的早晨（那古老的话题），萨莉忽然发起了脾气，气愤地告诉休说他代表了英国中产阶级生活中所有最讨厌的东西。她告诉休说，她觉得他要对“皮卡迪利大街上可怜的姑娘们”的情况负责——休，那个理想的绅士，可怜的休！从未有一个男人看上去比他更惊恐了！此后她说她是有意那样的（因为他们常在菜园子中相聚并交流意见）。“他不阅读，不思索，不去感知。”他又可以听见她用那十分强调的语气在讲话，声音要比她想的传得远很多。马童也要比休更有生命力，她说道。他是个英国私立学校培育出来的十足典型，她说道。只有英国那样的国家才能培育他那样的人。因为某个缘故，她实际上怀有恶意，对他有些怨恨。发生过什么事——他忘了是什么事——那是在吸烟室内。他冒犯了她——亲吻她了吗？不可思议！当然没人相信一句对休不利的话。谁会信呢？在吸烟室内亲吻萨莉！若是某位高贵的伊迪丝小姐或维奥莉特女士，那还有可能。可不会是那一文不名、衣衫褴褛的萨莉，况且她的父亲或是母亲还在蒙特卡洛赌博。因为他遇到的所有人中休是最势利的人——最会阿谀逢迎——不，他不是完全地阿谀奉承。他太一本正经了，不会完全那样做。将他比作顶级男侍明显更恰当——就是跟在身后提箱子的人，能把发电报的事交给他——对女主人而言是必不可少的帮手。而且他找到了他的工作——因为与高贵的伊夫琳结了婚。他在宫中找了份小差事，看管君王的地窖，抛光王室用的鞋扣，身穿及膝短裤和有蕾丝褶边的衣服四处忙活。多残酷的生活呀！宫中一个小差事！","Sally, to do her justice, saw through all that.One of the things he remembered best was an argument one Sunday morning at Bourton about women’s rights (that antediluvian topic), when Sally suddenly lost her temper, flared up, and told Hugh that he represented all that was most detestable in British middle-class life.She told him that she considered him responsible for the state of “those poor girls in Piccadilly”—Hugh, the perfect gentleman, poor Hugh!—never did a man look more horrified!She did it on purpose she said afterwards (for they used to get together in the vegetable garden and compare notes).“He’s read nothing, thought nothing, felt nothing,” he could hear her saying in that very emphatic voice which carried so much farther than she knew.The stable boys had more life in them than Hugh, she said.He was a perfect specimen of the public school type, she said.No country but England could have produced him.She was really spiteful, for some reason; had some grudge against him.Something had happened—he forgot what—in the smoking-room.He had insulted her—kissed her?Incredible!Nobody believed a word against Hugh of course.Who could?Kissing Sally in the smoking-room!If it had been some Honourable Edith or Lady Violet, perhaps; but not that ragamuffin Sally without a penny to her name, and a father or a mother gambling at Monte Carlo.For of all the people he had ever met Hugh was the greatest snob—the most obsequious—no, he didn’t cringe exactly.He was too much of a prig for that.A first-rate valet was the obvious comparison—somebody who walked behind carrying suit cases; could be trusted to send telegrams—indispensable to hostesses.And he’d found his job—married his Honourable Evelyn; got some little post at Court, looked after the King’s cellars, polished the Imperial shoe-buckles, went about in knee-breeches and lace ruffles.How remorseless life is!A little job at Court!"
"休与这女子结了婚，这位高贵的伊夫琳，他俩居住在这附近，彼得心想（他凝视着俯瞰公园的一些奢华房屋），因为他曾有一次在一栋房里享用过午餐，屋里有些摆设与休所有的财产一样，其他房屋是不可能拥有的——或许就是亚麻布制的柜橱。你只好走过去瞧瞧——不管那是什么东西，你都得花大量时间去称赞——亚麻布品制的柜橱、枕套、老橡木家具、画，休把这些收集起来是缘于一首老歌。可是休的夫人有时会泄露天机。她就是那种不知名的、胆怯如鼠的小女人，崇拜高大的男子汉。她几乎是微不足道的。而她会忽然说些很意外的话——刻薄的话。可能她还留有一点高贵的气质吧。蒸汽锅炉用的煤对她来说气味有点太过浓烈——它使空气变浑浊。反正他们住在这里，和他们的亚麻制的柜橱、古典名家的画作、名滚着真正蕾丝花边的枕套，过着一年大约五千或者一万英镑的生活。而他，比休大两岁呢，却为一份工作去乞求。","He had married this lady, the Honourable Evelyn, and they lived hereabouts, so he thought (looking at the pompous houses overlooking the Park), for he had lunched there once in a house which had, like all Hugh’s possessions, something that no other house could possibly have—linen cupboards it might have been.You had to go and look at them—you had to spend a great deal of time always admiring whatever it was—linen cupboards, pillow-cases, old oak furniture, pictures, which Hugh had picked up for an old song.But Mrs. Hugh sometimes gave the show away.She was one of those obscure mouse-like little women who admire big men.She was almost negligible.Then suddenly she would say something quite unexpected—something sharp.She had the relics of the grand manner perhaps.The steam coal was a little too strong for her—it made the atmosphere thick.And so there they lived, with their linen cupboards and their old masters and their pillow-cases fringed with real lace at the rate of five or ten thousand a year presumably, while he, who was two years older than Hugh, cadged for a job."
"他到五十三岁时只得来请求他们，将他安置在什么秘书室，要么帮他找一份教小孩拉丁文的代课工作，忍受办公室某官吏的差使，一年收入五百英镑。因为要是他娶了黛西，即使连同他的养老金，比这都少的话，他们就生活不下去了。惠特布雷德大概可以帮他，要么就是达洛维。他不介意请求达洛维的帮助。达洛维是一个十足的好人，只是有一点偏狭，头脑有些呆笨，没错，不过他真是个大好人。不管做什么事，他都用同样实事求是的理智方法，没一丝想象力，没一点才华的火花，却有着属于他那一类人的无法言说的谨慎。他应是一位乡绅——搞政治对他来说是浪费。他擅长的是在野外，骑马遛狗——他做得多好啊。例如，曾经克拉丽莎的大长毛狗困在陷阱中，半个爪子被扯裂了，克拉丽莎也晕倒了，达洛维处理了一切，为狗绑绷带、装夹板，告诉克拉丽莎不要犯傻。可能那就是她爱上达洛维的缘故——那就是她所需要的。“好了，亲爱的，不要犯傻。拿着这个——把那个取来。”他一直对狗说话，似乎它是一个人。","At fifty-three he had to come and ask them to put him into some secretary’s office, to find him some usher’s job teaching little boys Latin, at the beck and call of some mandarin in an office, something that brought in five hundred a year; for if he married Daisy, even with his pension, they could never do on less.Whitbread could do it presumably; or Dalloway.He didn’t mind what he asked Dalloway.He was a thorough good sort; a bit limited; a bit thick in the head; yes; but a thorough good sort.Whatever he took up he did in the same matter-of-fact sensible way; without a touch of imagination, without a spark of brilliancy, but with the inexplicable niceness of his type.He ought to have been a country gentleman—he was wasted on politics.He was at his best out of doors, with horses and dogs—how good he was, for instance, when that great shaggy dog of Clarissa’s got caught in a trap and had its paw half torn off, and Clarissa turned faint and Dalloway did the whole thing; bandaged, made splints; told Clarissa not to be a fool.That was what she liked him for perhaps—that was what she needed.“Now, my dear, don’t be a fool.Hold this—fetch that,” all the time talking to the dog as if it were a human being."
"不过她怎么消受得了他关于诗歌的那套见解啊？她怎么能任由他对莎士比亚长篇大论呢？理查德·达洛维站在那里，一脸认真和郑重，说正派人士都不应读莎士比亚的十四行诗，因为读他的诗就像把耳朵贴在锁眼上窃听（并且他也不赞成诗中写的那种关系）。 还说正派人士都不应让自己的妻子拜访一个已故女士的姊妹。真是不可思议！唯一可做的是用糖衣杏仁塞住他的嘴——此时在进晚餐。不过克拉丽莎把这些都听进去了，认为他如此诚实，如此有自己的见解。天知道她是否觉得他是她遇到过的思想最新奇的人呢！","But how could she swallow all that stuff about poetry?How could she let him hold forth about Shakespeare?Seriously and solemnly Richard Dalloway got on his hind legs and said that no decent man ought to read Shakespeare’s sonnets because it was like listening at keyholes (besides the relationship was not one that he approved).No decent man ought to let his wife visit a deceased wife’s sister.Incredible!The only thing to do was to pelt him with sugared almonds—it was at dinner.But Clarissa sucked it all in; thought it so honest of him; so independent of him; Heaven knows if she didn’t think him the most original mind she’d ever met!"
"那也是连接彼得和萨莉的纽带中的一条。他俩常到那里一处花园散步，四周有围墙，里面栽着一丛丛玫瑰和大朵的花椰菜——他能忆起萨莉摘下一朵玫瑰，停下来感叹月光里的甘蓝叶子有多美（异常奇怪的是，所有往事都生动地浮现在他脑海，这些事他多年都未想起过）。而萨莉自然是半开着玩笑，恳求他把克拉丽莎带走，把她从休与达洛维等所有“十足的绅士”那里解救出来，他们会“使她的灵魂窒息”（那段日子里萨莉写下很多诗歌），仅仅使她成为一个主妇，助长她的世故。可是必须公正地对待克拉丽莎。她不论怎样也不会和休结婚。她对自己所需要的有十分清晰的概念。她的感情都浮于表面。内心里，她十分机敏——比如，在对人的个性的辨别上她远远超过萨莉，而这一切完全出于女性直觉。她具有女性独特的禀赋，无论她在何处，都能创造自己的一方天地。她走进房间，她站在门口——就像他常见到的一样——四周总是簇拥着一大群人。而人们记住的是克拉丽莎。并非由于她引人注目，她根本就不美，她身上没什么动人之处，她从来也说不出特别机灵的话。不管怎样，她就是在别人的记忆中，就在那里。","That was one of the bonds between Sally and himself.There was a garden where they used to walk, a walled-in place, with rose-bushes and giant cauliflowers—he could remember Sally tearing off a rose, stopping to exclaim at the beauty of the cabbage leaves in the moonlight (it was extraordinary how vividly it all came back to him, things he hadn’t thought of for years,) while she implored him, half laughing of course, to carry off Clarissa, to save her from the Hughs and the Dalloways and all the other “perfect gentlemen” who would “stifle her soul” (she wrote reams of poetry in those days), make a mere hostess of her, encourage her worldliness.But one must do Clarissa justice.She wasn’t going to marry Hugh anyhow.She had a perfectly clear notion of what she wanted.Her emotions were all on the surface.Beneath, she was very shrewd—a far better judge of character than Sally, for instance, and with it all, purely feminine; with that extraordinary gift, that woman’s gift, of making a world of her own wherever she happened to be.She came into a room; she stood, as he had often seen her, in a doorway with lots of people round her.But it was Clarissa one remembered.Not that she was striking; not beautiful at all; there was nothing picturesque about her; she never said anything specially clever; there she was, however; there she was."
"不，不会，不会了！他再也不爱她了！他只是觉得，自从那个早上看到她摆弄剪刀和丝绸为聚会做准备以后，就抑制不住对她的思念。她不断地在他脑海浮现，好似火车车厢里一个睡着的人不断撞在他身上。当然，这不是爱，是忆起她，评论她，隔了三十年又开始尝试去说清她。显而易见的是她精明老练；她太在乎地位、社交、社会上的成功——一定程度上来说，这是事实，她向他承认过这点。（要是你不嫌费事你始终可以让她坦白，她是诚实的。）她会这样说，她厌恶邋遢女人、顽固守旧的人和失败的人，也许就是他那种人。她觉得人们无权把双手插在衣服口袋中无精打采无所事事，必须得做点什么，成就些什么，而你在她客厅中遇到的那些有头有脸的人、那些公爵夫人、那些白发苍苍的伯爵夫人，他觉得那群人难以言喻地毫无价值可言，而对她来说却意味着某种真实。她有一次说，贝克斯伯勒夫人身板直直地挺着（克拉丽莎本人也是这样，她从未懒散地斜倚着，她直挺挺的如一杆标枪，其实有点僵硬）。她说她们有种胆识，她的年纪越大就越是倾佩这种胆识。当然，这其中有很多达洛维的见解，很多对公益的关注、大英帝国、关税革新、统治阶级精神等，她越来越习惯这些，这是必然的。她的智慧是他的两倍，却只能透过他的双眼看事物——夫妻生活的悲剧之一。她自身是有头脑的，却一定老是要援引理查德的话——就好像你不能通过阅读早晨的《晨邮报》中不差毫厘地了解理查德的思想一样！例如，这些聚会全是为他举行的，或是为她理想中的他（替理查德说句公道话，要是他在诺福克从事农业会更快乐）。她把她的客厅变为一种聚会场所，这方面她很有天赋。彼得一次又一次看见她领着某个青涩的年轻人，折磨他、改造他、唤醒他、让他上路。当然，难以计数的呆笨之人簇拥在她周围。不过也会意外地有奇怪之人出现；时而是一位艺术家；时而是一位作家。他们在那样的氛围里是古怪的人。而这一切的幕后是一套走亲访友、馈赠名片、待人友好的网络。拿着一束束花朵以及小礼物奔走四方。某某人要去法国了——一定要送个气垫。真是令她费尽心力，全是她这种女人坚持的无止境的社交活动；不过她真心地做着，出于天性本能。","No, no, no!He was not in love with her any more!He only felt, after seeing her that morning, among her scissors and silks, making ready for the party, unable to get away from the thought of her; she kept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a railway carriage; which was not being in love, of course; it was thinking of her, criticising her, starting again, after thirty years, trying to explain her.The obvious thing to say of her was that she was worldly; cared too much for rank and society and getting on in the world—which was true in a sense; she had admitted it to him.(You could always get her to own up if you took the trouble; she was honest.) What she would say was that she hated frumps, fogies, failures, like himself presumably; thought people had no right to slouch about with their hands in their pockets; must do something, be something; and these great swells, these Duchesses, these hoary old Countesses one met in her drawing-room, unspeakably remote as he felt them to be from anything that mattered a straw, stood for something real to her.Lady Bexborough, she said once, held herself upright (so did Clarissa herself; she never lounged in any sense of the word; she was straight as a dart, a little rigid in fact).She said they had a kind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected.In all this there was a great deal of Dalloway, of course; a great deal of the public-spirited, British Empire, tariff-reform, governing-class spirit, which had grown on her, as it tends to do.With twice his wits, she had to see things through his eyes—one of the tragedies of married life.With a mind of her own, she must always be quoting Richard—as if one couldn’t know to a tittle what Richard thought by reading the Morning Post of a morning!These parties for example were all for him, or for her idea of him (to do Richard justice he would have been happier farming in Norfolk).She made her drawing-room a sort of meeting-place; she had a genius for it.Over and over again he had seen her take some raw youth, twist him, turn him, wake him up; set him going.Infinite numbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course.But odd unexpected people turned up; an artist sometimes; sometimes a writer; queer fish in that atmosphere.And behind it all was that network of visiting, leaving cards, being kind to people; running about with bunches of flowers, little presents; So-and-so was going to France—must have an air-cushion; a real drain on her strength; all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up; but she did it genuinely, from a natural instinct."
"说来也怪，她是他见过的人中最彻头彻尾的怀疑论者之一，也许（这是他过去制造出来解释她的一条理论，她在某些方面那么明朗，在其他方面又那么高深莫测）。也许她自言自语道，由于我们这个民族与一条正在下沉的船拴在了一起，难逃一死（她少女时期最爱看赫胥黎和廷德尔的著作，他俩都喜欢这些航海类的隐喻），由于一切皆是一个低劣的笑话，就让我们无论如何尽自己的职责，减少我们狱友的痛苦（赫胥黎的话又来了），用花朵和气垫装扮囚牢；尽我们所能保持得体。那些凶恶之徒，那些神明们，不准他们自作主张，恣意妄为——她认为，神明们从未放弃一个时机来伤害、破坏、糟践人的生命。尽管如此，如果你的举止像位文雅的淑女，它们就会元气大伤。她那种心理在西尔维娅死后很快表现出来——那件恐怖的事。克拉丽莎老是说，亲眼看到自己的亲姊妹被一棵倒下的树压死（全是贾斯廷·帕里的过失——全怪他的疏忽），就在你眼前死去，足够使人变得满怀仇恨。那是个也将要开始生活的女孩，在姊妹里最有才华。此后克拉丽莎或许就没那样确定了。她觉得没有鬼神，不该责备任何人，如此她就演化出这套无神论者的宗教信仰，为善去做善事。","Oddly enough, she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he had ever met, and possibly (this was a theory he used to make up to account for her, so transparent in some ways, so inscrutable in others), possibly she said to herself, As we are a doomed race, chained to a sinking ship (her favourite reading as a girl was Huxley and Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical metaphors), as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate, do our part; mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners (Huxley again); decorate the dungeon with flowers and air-cushions; be as decent as we possibly can.Those ruffians, the Gods, shan’t have it all their own way,—her notion being that the Gods, who never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives were seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady.That phase came directly after Sylvia’s death—that horrible affair.To see your own sister killed by a falling tree (all Justin Parry’s fault—all his carelessness) before your very eyes, a girl too on the verge of life, the most gifted of them, Clarissa always said, was enough to turn one bitter.Later she wasn’t so positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist’s religion of doing good for the sake of goodness."
"当然，她尽情地享受着生活。她生来就是要享受生活的（尽管只有天知道，她有自己的矜持。他常感到，即使在他俩相识多年之后，他对克拉丽莎也只能有粗略地了解）。无论如何，她身上没有愁苦，没有贤淑女人身上那种令人厌恶的美德。她简直什么都喜爱。假如你与她在海德公园漫步，她时而会对一丛郁金香感兴趣，时而留心婴儿车里的一个小孩，时而一时兴起杜撰什么荒诞的短剧。（要是她觉得那些恋人不幸福，她很可能会去劝说。）她有一种十分强烈的喜剧感，不过她需要别人，总是需要别人帮她发挥出来，而难以避免的结果就是她把时间都浪费掉了。午餐、晚餐，无穷尽地举行她那些聚会，说些没有意义的话，说些表里不一的话，让敏锐的思想变得愚钝，丧失了自身辨别力。她会坐在饭桌的主人席上，煞费周折应付某个或许对达洛维有帮助的老家伙——他们清楚欧洲最惊骇的琐事——要么就是伊丽莎白进来了，一切必定围绕着她。伊丽莎白在念中学，上次彼得去她家时她还处于不善言辞的年纪。她是个眼睛圆圆的、脸色苍白的姑娘，性情沉默、木讷，根本没有她母亲的样子，她把一切都看作理所当然，任由母亲对自己过份细致入微的照顾，尔后说：“我现在能走了吗？”就像一个四岁孩子。克拉丽莎解释说，伊丽莎白是去玩曲棍球了，话语中参杂着开心与得意，这情绪似乎是达洛维本人在她心中激起的。如今伊丽莎白大概已“进入社交界”，便认为他是老顽固，取笑她母亲的那些朋友。哎，如此也罢。老年的补偿只有这么一点，彼得·沃尔什思考着，一边走出摄政公园，手里拿着帽子，激情仍如以往一样强烈，可是取得了——终于取得了——为生存添加崇高情趣的力量，掌握人生阅历的力量，在光明中慢慢改变生活的力量。","And of course she enjoyed life immensely.It was her nature to enjoy (though goodness only knows, she had her reserves; it was a mere sketch, he often felt, that even he, after all these years, could make of Clarissa).Anyhow there was no bitterness in her; none of that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women.She enjoyed practically everything.If you walked with her in Hyde Park now it was a bed of tulips, now a child in a perambulator, now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment.(Very likely, she would have talked to those lovers, if she had thought them unhappy.) She had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite, but she needed people, always people, to bring it out, with the inevitable result that she frittered her time away, lunching, dining, giving these incessant parties of hers, talking nonsense, sayings things she didn’t mean, blunting the edge of her mind, losing her discrimination.There she would sit at the head of the table taking infinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to Dalloway—they knew the most appalling bores in Europe—or in came Elizabeth and everything must give way to HER.She was at a High School, at the inarticulate stage last time he was over, a round-eyed, pale-faced girl, with nothing of her mother in her, a silent stolid creature, who took it all as a matter of course, let her mother make a fuss of her, and then said “May I go now?” like a child of four; going off, Clarissa explained, with that mixture of amusement and pride which Dalloway himself seemed to rouse in her, to play hockey.And now Elizabeth was “out,” presumably; thought him an old fogy, laughed at her mother’s friends.Ah well, so be it.The compensation of growing old, Peter Walsh thought, coming out of Regent’s Park, and holding his hat in hand, was simply this; that the passions remain as strong as ever, but one has gained—at last!—the power which adds the supreme flavour to existence,—the power of taking hold of experience, of turning it round, slowly, in the light."
"这是一个可怕的忏悔（他又戴上帽子），不过如今，一个五十三岁的人几乎不再需要人陪伴了。生活自身，生活的每一刻，每一滴，在这里，这一瞬，此刻，在阳光中，在摄政公园里，足够了。其实太多了。既然一个人获得了这种力量，若要领略所有的情趣，吸收一点一滴的乐趣，体会每一层细微的含义，整个一生都嫌短暂。而这两者都比以前要实在得多，个人色彩要少得多。他再也不可能感受到克拉丽莎曾带给他的痛苦了。因为他每次会连续几个小时（上帝保佑他能说这些而不被窃听）、几个小时、几天里不想黛西。","A terrible confession it was (he put his hat on again), but now, at the age of fifty-three one scarcely needed people any more.Life itself, every moment of it, every drop of it, here, this instant, now, in the sun, in Regent’s Park, was enough.Too much indeed.A whole lifetime was too short to bring out, now that one had acquired the power, the full flavour; to extract every ounce of pleasure, every shade of meaning; which both were so much more solid than they used to be, so much less personal.It was impossible that he should ever suffer again as Clarissa had made him suffer.For hours at a time (pray God that one might say these things without being overheard!), for hours and days he never thought of Daisy."
"他想起那些日子的苦难、折磨、那非凡的激情，难道是因为他还爱着黛西吗？这次截然不同—更愉悦得多——当然了，事实是，如今黛西正爱着他。而那可能就是为什么船真的出航时，他感到有一丝奇特的放松。除了想单独一人外，他什么也不想要。在船舱里发现黛西对他献的所有小殷勤时——雪茄、记事本、旅途用的毯子——他感到很烦。每个诚实的人说的都会一样。一个超过五十岁的人不再需要伴侣，不想再讨好女人说她们很漂亮，年过五十的人，凡是诚实的，多数会这样说，彼得·沃尔什想。","Could it be that he was in love with her then, remembering the misery, the torture, the extraordinary passion of those days?It was a different thing altogether—a much pleasanter thing—the truth being, of course, that now SHE was in love with HIM.And that perhaps was the reason why, when the ship actually sailed, he felt an extraordinary relief, wanted nothing so much as to be alone; was annoyed to find all her little attentions—cigars, notes, a rug for the voyage—in his cabin.Every one if they were honest would say the same; one doesn’t want people after fifty; one doesn’t want to go on telling women they are pretty; that’s what most men of fifty would say, Peter Walsh thought, if they were honest."
"不过这些惊人的情感宣泄——今早忽然大哭，这一切是为什么？克拉丽莎会怎么看他呢？认为他可能是一个笨蛋吧，这已经不是第一次了。这归根到底是妒忌引起的——比人类其他情感都持久的妒忌，彼得·沃尔什思索着，一边握住他的折刀，伸直手臂。黛西在上次的信中说，她去见过奥德少校。他明白她是故意这样说，说来使他妒忌。他可以想象她蹙额写信的样子，思索她要怎样写才可以使他伤心。可是这没起作用，他大发雷霆！他回英国找律师而经历的一番忙乱不是为了娶她，而是阻止她与其他人结婚。正是妒忌在折磨他，那就是他见到克拉丽莎那么平静、那么冷漠、那么专注于礼服之类的事物时涌上心头的感觉。他意识到她本可以不伤害他，她已把他变为——一个啜泣哭诉的老顽固。他关上折刀，想道，可女人不懂激情是什么。她们不懂激情对于男人的意义。克拉丽莎冷若寒冰。她会挨着他坐在沙发上，任他握住她的手，为他献上一吻——此时他来到了十字路口。","But then these astonishing accesses of emotion—bursting into tears this morning, what was all that about?What could Clarissa have thought of him?thought him a fool presumably, not for the first time.It was jealousy that was at the bottom of it—jealousy which survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought, holding his pocket-knife at arm’s length.She had been meeting Major Orde, Daisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he knew; said it to make him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him; and yet it made no difference; he was furious!All this pother of coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn’t to marry her, but to prevent her from marrying anybody else.That was what tortured him, that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was; realising what she might have spared him, what she had reduced him to—a whimpering, snivelling old ass.But women, he thought, shutting his pocket-knife, don’t know what passion is.They don’t know the meaning of it to men.Clarissa was as cold as an icicle.There she would sit on the sofa by his side, let him take her hand, give him one kiss—Here he was at the crossing."
"有个声音打断了他，一个微弱颤抖的声音，那声音如冒泡一般，无方向、无生气、无起点与结尾，无力又锐利地流动着，没有一丝人类的蕴义，说着噫嗯发嗯嗖弗斯微土埃姆呜——","A sound interrupted him; a frail quivering sound, a voice bubbling up without direction, vigour, beginning or end, running weakly and shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo—"
"这声音分不清年龄或性别，像是泉水从地面一处古老的泉喷涌出来的声音；来自恰好在摄政公园地铁站对面一个高高的、颤动着的影像，形似漏斗，似生锈的泵，似一棵被风摧残的永不长叶的树，任风在枝条中穿梭，歌唱着咦嗯发嗯嗦弗斯微土埃姆呜。树便在那无休止的微风中晃动，发出嘎吱声和呻吟声。","the voice of no age or sex, the voice of an ancient spring spouting from the earth; which issued, just opposite Regent’s Park Tube station from a tall quivering shape, like a funnel, like a rusty pump, like a wind-beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets the wind run up and down its branches singing ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze."
"历经所有年代——当人行道仍是草地、仍是沼泽的时候，历经长牙野兽和猛犸象的年代，历经静默的日出的年代，那受尽折磨的女人——由于她身着裙装——右手裸露在外，左手紧握、贴在身边，站着歌颂爱情——她歌颂的是延续了千百万年的爱，压倒一切的爱，她轻轻地唱着她死去了几个世纪的情人，而几百万年以前，她的情人与她还在五月里漫步。不过她记得，尽管岁月的历程长如夏日，盛开的皆是火焰般的红色紫菀，他去了。死神那巨大的镰刀扫荡了巍峨的群山，最后她灰白苍老的头埋在大地中，这片土地如今成了纯粹的冰渣，她向诸神祈求在她身边放一束紫色石南花，放在最后的太阳的最后一缕光线抚慰着的她高耸的墓地上。因为到那时，宇宙的盛会将会结束。","Through all ages—when the pavement was grass, when it was swamp, through the age of tusk and mammoth, through the age of silent sunrise, the battered woman—for she wore a skirt—with her right hand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of love—love which has lasted a million years, she sang, love which prevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead these centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May; but in the course of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she remembered, with nothing but red asters, he had gone; death’s enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills, and when at last she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth, now become a mere cinder of ice, she implored the Gods to lay by her side a bunch of purple-heather, there on her high burial place which the last rays of the last sun caressed; for then the pageant of the universe would be over."
"当那支古老的歌曲在摄政公园地铁站对面传出时，大地看来依旧郁郁葱葱、繁花似锦。虽然这首歌来自粗俗之口，也就是地上一个泥泞的洞，纠缠在树根纤维与缠绕的野草中，不过这首古老的、汩汩流淌的歌浸透了无尽岁月里纠缠的树根，浸透了骷髅和宝藏，形成溪流，流过人行道，沿着马里勒伯恩街，往下向尤斯顿街流去，给大地施肥，留下了一点湿润的印迹。","As the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent’s Park Tube station still the earth seemed green and flowery; still, though it issued from so rude a mouth, a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted with root fibres and tangled grasses, still the old bubbling burbling song, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages, and skeletons and treasure, streamed away in rivulets over the pavement and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards Euston, fertilising, leaving a damp stain."
"她仍回忆着曾在某个远古的五月里她与情人漫步的情形，这个生锈的泵，这位受尽折磨的老妇人，露出一只手索要铜币，另一只手紧握、贴在身边。她千万年后依旧会在那里，想起曾经她是怎样在五月里漫步。如今海水在那里奔流，和谁一起并不重要——他是一个男子，哦，是的，一个曾爱过她的男子。然而岁月的流逝模糊了那个古老而清晰的五月天。朵朵花瓣明丽的花蒙上了银灰色的霜，变得灰白。当她恳求他（就像她此刻颇明显地乞求一般）“用你那甜蜜的眼睛正视我的双眼”时，她再也见不到，再也见不到那棕色的眼，黑黑的络腮胡和晒黑的脸庞，只见到一个朦胧的影象，一个影子。她仍有着年迈老人鸟一样的清新。她颤抖地唱着：“把你的手伸给我，让我温柔地抚摸。”（彼得·沃尔什迈入出租汽车前禁不住投给那可怜的老妇人一个硬币）。“假如被人撞见，又有何干？”她质问。她握紧手，贴在身边，微笑着，把那一先令放入口袋。所有好奇凝视的眼睛好像都不见了，过去的世世代代也消逝了——人行道上满是熙熙攘攘的中产阶级人群——似叶子一样，被踩在脚下，被那永恒的喷泉浸透、淹没、变成沃土消失了——咦嗯发嗯嗦弗斯微土埃姆呜","Still remembering how once in some primeval May she had walked with her lover, this rusty pump, this battered old woman with one hand exposed for coppers the other clutching her side, would still be there in ten million years, remembering how once she had walked in May, where the sea flows now, with whom it did not matter—he was a man, oh yes, a man who had loved her.But the passage of ages had blurred the clarity of that ancient May day; the bright petalled flowers were hoar and silver frosted; and she no longer saw, when she implored him (as she did now quite clearly) “look in my eyes with thy sweet eyes intently,” she no longer saw brown eyes, black whikers or sunburnt face but only a looming shape, a shadow shape, to which, with the bird-like freshness of the very aged she still twittered “give me your hand and let me presss it gently” (Peter Walsh couldn’t help giving the poor creature a coin as he stepped into his taxi), “and if some one should see, what matter they?” she demanded; and her first clutched at her side, and she smiled, pocketing her shilling, and all peering inquisitive eyes seemed blotted out, and the passing generations—the pavement was crowded with bustling middle-class people—vanished, like leaves, to be trodden under, to be soaked and steeped and made mould of by that eternal spring—ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo"
"“不幸的老妇人。”雷齐娅·沃伦·史密斯说，一边等待过街。","“Poor old woman,” said Rezia Warren Smith, waiting to cross."
"噢，悲惨的老妇人！","Oh poor old wretch!"
"设想这是一个雨夜呢？要是老妇人的父亲，或在她过好日子的时候认识的人碰巧打这里路过，瞧见她站在阴沟边呢？她在哪里过夜呢？","Suppose it was a wet night?Suppose one’s father, or somebody who had known one in better days had happened to pass, and saw one standing there in the gutter?And where did she sleep at night?"
"那不可战胜的一缕歌声愉悦地、几乎是快活地在空中回旋，如村舍烟囱里冒出的烟，袅绕着一丛丛干净的山毛榉，化作一团蓝色烟雾在树顶部的叶子中飘散。","Cheerfully, almost gaily, the invincible thread of sound wound up into the air like the smoke from a cottage chimney, winding up clean beech trees and issuing in a tuft of blue smoke among the topmost leaves."
"“假如被人撞见，又有何干？”","“And if some one should see, what matter they?”"
"由于雷齐娅最近接连几周都郁郁寡欢，她对发生的事情都有感慨，有时候几乎感到她必须截住街上面善的好人们，仅是为了告诉他们“我不快乐”。而这位在街上唱着“假如被人撞见，又有何干？”的老妇人让她瞬间就颇为确信一切都将好转。他们要去会见威廉·布拉德肖爵士。她认为他的名字听起来不错，他会立即治愈塞普蒂默斯的病。然后来了一辆啤酒厂的运货马车，灰色马匹的尾巴上插着直立的鬃毛般的稻草，还有新闻布告。郁郁寡欢是一个蠢之又蠢的梦。","Since she was so unhappy, for weeks and weeks now, Rezia had given meanings to things that happened, almost felt sometimes that she must stop people in the street, if they looked good, kind people, just to say to them “I am unhappy”; and this old woman singing in the street “if some one should see, what matter they?” made her suddenly quite sure that everything was going to be right.They were going to Sir William Bradshaw; she thought his name sounded nice; he would cure Septimus at once.And then there was a brewer’s cart, and the grey horses had upright bristles of straw in their tails; there were newspaper placards.It was a silly, silly dream, being unhappy."
"就这样，塞普蒂默斯·沃伦·史密斯先生和太太两人过了街。究竟他们有什么引起注意的地方，有什么引起行人猜测，这位年轻人心中藏有世界上最伟大的旨意。并且，他是世界上最幸福，也是最悲惨的人？或许他们比其他人走得更慢，男子的脚步中透着某些犹豫，拖沓不前，可是对多年以来也没在工作日的这一刻来过伦敦西区的一个职员来说，有什么比不断地仰视天空，东看看西瞧瞧更自然呢？波特兰街似乎是他走进的一个屋子，那一家人都离开了，枝形吊灯悬挂在白亚麻布包中，看门人掀开长长的百叶窗的一角，使一道道伴有浮尘的长光束照射在废弃的、造型怪异的扶椅上，他向游人解释这地方是多美妙啊，多美妙啊。他注视着桌椅，心想，不过同时又多怪异啊。","So they crossed, Mr. and Mrs. Septimus Warren Smith, and was there, after all, anything to draw attention to them, anything to make a passer-by suspect here is a young man who carries in him the greatest message in the world, and is, moreover, the happiest man in the world, and the most miserable?Perhaps they walked more slowly than other people, and there was something hesitating, trailing, in the man’s walk, but what more natural for a clerk, who has not been in the West End on a weekday at this hour for years, than to keep looking at the sky, looking at this, that and the other, as if Portland Place were a room he had come into when the family are away, the chandeliers being hung in holland bags, and the caretaker, as she lets in long shafts of dusty light upon deserted, queer-looking armchairs, lifting one corner of the long blinds, explains to the visitors what a wonderful place it is; how wonderful, but at the same time, he thinks, as he looks at chairs and tables, how strange."
"从外表来看，他可能是位职员，不过是高级一点的职员。因为他脚穿褐色皮靴，从他的手可以看出他受过教育，他侧面轮廓也给人这种印象——棱角鲜明，大鼻子，聪慧细腻，而他上下嘴唇却不是这样，因为它们有些松弛。他的双眼（凡是眼睛都是那样）不过是普通的眼睛，黄褐色，大大的。所以大体看来他处于边界状态，既不是这类，也不是那类。他可能最终会搬入珀利的一所房子，买一辆汽车，或一生都在后街租一套公寓。他是凭自学获得一半教育的那种人。他每晚工作结束以后都会阅读，阅读的书都是通过写信咨询一些知名作家的意见后，从公共图书馆借来的。","To look at, he might have been a clerk, but of the better sort; for he wore brown boots; his hands were educated; so, too, his profile—his angular, big-nosed, intelligent, sensitive profile; but not his lips altogether, for they were loose; and his eyes (as eyes tend to be), eyes merely; hazel, large; so that he was, on the whole, a border case, neither one thing nor the other, might end with a house at Purley and a motor car, or continue renting apartments in back streets all his life; one of those half-educated, self-educated men whose education is all learnt from books borrowed from public libraries, read in the evening after the day’s work, on the advice of well-known authors consulted by letter."
"谈到其他经历，就是人们独自于卧室、办公室中、在田间以及伦敦街上漫步的感受，他都体验过。他还只是个孩童时，就离开家了，那是因为他母亲骗了他；因为他几乎有五十次没洗手就下楼去喝茶；因为他看出在斯特劳德，诗人是没有未来的。所以，他告诉小妹心腹之言后，留下一纸荒唐的短笺就到伦敦去了。和大人物写的一样，在他们奋斗的事迹有名以后，天下人就会来读他的短笺。","As for the other experiences, the solitary ones, which people go through alone, in their bedrooms, in their offices, walking the fields and the streets of London, he had them; had left home, a mere boy, because of his mother; she lied; because he came down to tea for the fiftieth time with his hands unwashed; because he could see no future for a poet in Stroud; and so, making a confidant of his little sister, had gone to London leaving an absurd note behind him, such as great men have written, and the world has read later when the story of their struggles has become famous."
"伦敦吸纳了千百万叫做史密斯的青年，却不在乎如塞普蒂默斯之类荒诞的洗礼名，父母给孩子取这些名字是为了让他们不同寻常。他住在从尤斯顿街岔出来的一条小街上，有过各种各样的经历，例如两年中他那红扑扑的稚嫩的椭圆脸就变得瘦削、起皱、可憎。然而对这一切来说，就算是最长于观察的朋友们又能说什么呢？除了像园丁早上开启温室的门，发现他的植株中开出一朵花时所说的：花开了；从虚荣、抱负、理想主义、激情、寂寞、胆识、惰性之类寻常种子里开出的花，这一切混合起来（在从尤斯顿街岔出来的一条小街的一间屋子里）让他羞怯、讲话结巴，让他急于提高自身，让他爱上伊莎贝尔·波尔小姐。她在滑铁卢街上讲授莎士比亚戏剧。","London has swallowed up many millions of young men called Smith; thought nothing of fantastic Christian names like Septimus with which their parents have thought to distinguish them.Lodging off the Euston Road, there were experiences, again experiences, such as change a face in two years from a pink innocent oval to a face lean, contracted, hostile.But of all this what could the most observant of friends have said except what a gardener says when he opens the conservatory door in the morning and finds a new blossom on his plant:—It has flowered; flowered from vanity, ambition, idealism, passion, loneliness, courage, laziness, the usual seeds, which all muddled up (in a room off the Euston Road), made him shy, and stammering, made him anxious to improve himself, made him fall in love with Miss Isabel Pole, lecturing in the Waterloo Road upon Shakespeare."
"他不是像济慈么？她问道。并且思考着她怎样才能让他品味《安东尼奥和克利奥佩特拉》及其他作品。她借给他书，写给他一些短笺，点燃他心中一生只燃烧一次的火焰，不产生热量，只在波尔小姐周围闪耀着无限飘渺和虚幻的金红色火焰。《安东尼奥和克利奥佩特拉》，滑铁卢街。他认为她很漂亮，认为她有完美无瑕的智慧。他梦到过她，还为她写诗。她不顾诗的主旨，用红墨水笔修改诗中的错误。有一个夏夜，他看到她身着绿裙漫步于广场。“花开了。”园丁假若开门可能会这样说。也就是说，假若园丁在任何一个夜晚的大约此刻进门，就会发现他在写东西，发现他撕毁自己写的东西，发现他凌晨三点完成了一部名篇，跑去街上溜达，游览教堂，一天禁食，另一天又饮酒，贪婪地阅读莎士比亚、达尔文、《文明史》和萧伯纳的著作。","Was he not like Keats?she asked; and reflected how she might give him a taste of @Antony and Cleopatra@ and the rest; lent him books; wrote him scraps of letters; and lit in him such a fire as burns only once in a lifetime, without heat, flickering a red gold flame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over Miss Pole; @Antony and Cleopatra@; and the Waterloo Road.He thought her beautiful, believed her impeccably wise; dreamed of her, wrote poems to her, which, ignoring the subject, she corrected in red ink; he saw her, one summer evening, walking in a green dress in a square.“It has flowered,” the gardener might have said, had he opened the door; had he come in, that is to say, any night about this time, and found him writing; found him tearing up his writing; found him finishing a masterpiece at three o’clock in the morning and running out to pace the streets, and visiting churches, and fasting one day, drinking another, devouring Shakespeare, Darwin, @The History of Civilisation@, and Bernard Shaw."
"发生了什么事情，布鲁尔先生是知道的。布鲁尔先生在锡布利与阿罗史密斯公司任管理员，该公司的业务是拍卖、估值以及房地产代理。发生了什么事情，他想道，因为他对自己管理的青年们有父亲般的爱，所以他高度评价史密斯的才能，并预见十年或十五年以内，他会成功坐上里面屋子天窗下的那把皮革扶手椅，周围放着些契约文书保险箱。“只要他保持健康的身体。”布鲁尔先生说道，而那是威胁所在——他看起来软弱无力。他劝史密斯玩足球，邀他共进晚餐，准备考虑推荐给他涨薪，此时却有事发生了，这使布鲁尔先生的诸多预测都被否决了，带走了他最有才干的青年。最终，欧洲战争的魔爪如此无处不在，如此阴险毒辣，把谷物女神的石膏雕塑击碎了，把天竺葵花床炸了一个洞，还彻底伤透了布鲁尔先生在麦斯威山住宅里的厨师的神经。","Something was up, Mr. Brewer knew; Mr. Brewer, managing clerk at Sibleys and Arrowsmiths, auctioneers, valuers, land and estate agents; something was up, he thought, and, being paternal with his young men, and thinking very highly of Smith’s abilities, and prophesying that he would, in ten or fifteen years, succeed to the leather arm-chair in the inner room under the skylight with the deed-boxes round him, “if he keeps his health,” said Mr. Brewer, and that was the danger—he looked weakly; advised football, invited him to supper and was seeing his way to consider recommending a rise of salary, when something happened which threw out many of Mr. Brewer’s calculations, took away his ablest young fellows, and eventually, so prying and insidious were the fingers of the European War, smashed a plaster cast of Ceres, ploughed a hole in the geranium beds, and utterly ruined the cook’s nerves at Mr. Brewer’s establishment at Muswell Hill."
"塞普蒂默斯是最早自愿入伍的人中的一个。他为了挽救英国而奔赴法国。他认为英国差不多全是由莎士比亚戏剧和身着绿裙、漫步于广场的伊莎贝尔·珀尔小姐构成的。布鲁尔先生劝他玩足球时所渴望看到的改变在战壕里立即就产生了。他彰显出了男子气概；他得到了提升；他受到一个叫埃文斯的长官的关注，甚至是喜爱。这种情形好比两只狗在炉前地毯上玩耍。其中一只在撕咬纸球，咆哮着猛地咬上去，时而咬一咬老狗的耳朵；另一只懒散地躺着，对着炉火眨眼，举起爪子，转身和善地吠叫几声。他俩肯定得在一起，相互陪伴，相互争斗，相互吵嘴。可是当埃文斯（与他只见过一面的雷齐娅称他为“一个安静的人”，一个强壮的红发男子，在女人面前显得含蓄）、当埃文斯刚好在停火前夕战死于意大利时，塞普蒂默斯远没有流露任何情感，也没有意识到这是友情的结束，反倒庆幸自己漠不关心，很是明智。这场战争给了他教训。战斗是崇高的。他经受了全部的场景，友情、欧洲战争、死亡，得到了晋升，还未满三十，一定得活下去。这一点他是正确的。最后一批炮弹未打中他。他冷漠地眼见它们爆炸。和平来临之际他正在米兰，被安置到一位旅店老板的家中。那里有一个庭院，盆里栽着花，户外摆着小桌子，老板的几个女儿在做帽子。而有天晚上他感到恐慌——因为他丧失了感觉的能力——于是便与这家的小女儿卢克雷齐娅订了婚。","Septimus was one of the first to volunteer.He went to France to save an England which consisted almost entirely of Shakespeare’s plays and Miss Isabel Pole in a green dress walking in a square.There in the trenches the change which Mr. Brewer desired when he advised football was produced instantly; he developed manliness; he was promoted; he drew the attention, indeed the affection of his officer, Evans by name.It was a case of two dogs playing on a hearth-rug; one worrying a paper screw, snarling, snapping, giving a pinch, now and then, at the old dog’s ear; the other lying somnolent, blinking at the fire, raising a paw, turning and growling good-temperedly.They had to be together, share with each other, fight with each other, quarrel with each other.But when Evans (Rezia who had only seen him once called him “a quiet man,” a sturdy red-haired man, undemonstrative in the company of women), when Evans was killed, just before the Armistice, in Italy, Septimus, far from showing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a friendship, congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very reasonably.The War had taught him.It was sublime.He had gone through the whole show, friendship, European War, death, had won promotion, was still under thirty and was bound to survive.He was right there.The last shells missed him.He watched them explode with indifference.When peace came he was in Milan, billeted in the house of an innkeeper with a courtyard, flowers in tubs, little tables in the open, daughters making hats, and to Lucrezia, the younger daughter, he became engaged one evening when the panic was on him—that he could not feel."
"如今一切都已终结，停战协定已经签署，死者也已埋葬。他却陷入一阵骤然的、霹雳一般的恐怖，尤其是在夜里。","For now that it was all over, truce signed, and the dead buried, he had, especially in the evening, these sudden thunder-claps of fear."
"他丧失了感觉的能力。他开门进了那些意大利女子坐着做帽子的那间屋子。他能看到她们，能听到她们说话。她们在碟子里放着的彩珠中搓金属线。她们把硬麻布制成的模型来回转动。桌上满是羽毛、闪光的饰片、丝绸、丝带。剪刀轻触桌面，可他缺失了某个东西，他丧失了感觉的能力。但是剪刀轻轻的碰撞、女孩们的笑声、帽子的制成保护着他。他的安全得到了保证，他有了一处避难所。可他不能整夜在那里坐着。他清晨常有醒来的时刻。床在下沉，他在下沉。哦！要是能有剪刀、灯光以及硬麻布模型就好了！他求卢克雷齐娅嫁给他，她是两个女孩里较年轻的那个，欢快、轻佻，有艺术家那样纤细的手指，她老是伸开手指说“一切尽在其中”。丝绸、羽毛，还有什么不是在那双手指的拨弄下栩栩如生的。","He could not feel.As he opened the door of the room where the Italian girls sat making hats, he could see them; could hear them; they were rubbing wires among coloured beads in saucers; they were turning buckram shapes this way and that; the table was all strewn with feathers, spangles, silks, ribbons; scissors were rapping on the table; but something failed him; he could not feel.Still, scissors rapping, girls laughing, hats being made protected him; he was assured of safety; he had a refuge.But he could not sit there all night.There were moments of waking in the early morning.The bed was falling; he was falling.Oh for the scissors and the lamplight and the buckram shapes!He asked Lucrezia to marry him, the younger of the two, the gay, the frivolous, with those little artist’s fingers that she would hold up and say “It is all in them.”Silk, feathers, what not were alive to them."
"“帽子最重要。”他们一起散步时，她会这样说。对路上见到的每一只帽子，她都会细致地观察，观察披风、裙子以及那女人的仪态。她厌恶衣衫不整、过度打扮，但表达并不激烈，只是用手的动作来不耐烦地表达出来，就像一个画家将显然并无恶意的、耀眼的赝品从身前拿开时所做的动作那样。然后，她会用大方又批判的态度，称赞一个将自身那点服饰穿得漂亮的女店员。要么就满怀激情，运用行家的眼力，对一位穿着栗鼠皮大衣、套着长袍、戴着珍珠、从马车上下来的法国女士毫无保留地赞美。","“It is the hat that matters most,” she would say, when they walked out together.Every hat that passed, she would examine; and the cloak and the dress and the way the woman held herself.Ill-dressing, over-dressing she stigmatised, not savagely, rather with impatient movements of the hands, like those of a painter who puts from him some obvious well-meant glaring imposture; and then, generously, but always critically, she would welcome a shopgirl who had turned her little bit of stuff gallantly, or praise, wholly, with enthusiastic and professional understanding, a French lady descending from her carriage, in chinchilla, robes, pearls."
"“好美啊！”她会这样低声说道，并用肘轻推塞普蒂默斯，叫他也瞧瞧。不过美和他隔着一层玻璃窗。甚至美味（雷齐娅爱吃冰激凌、巧克力之类的甜食）也引不起他的食欲。他将自己的杯子搁在大理石小桌上。他注视着外面的人群。他们似乎很幸福，在街心聚在一起，喊着、笑着、无端地争论。可是他食而无味，他丧失了感觉的能力。在茶馆中，周围都是茶桌与喋喋不休的服务生，他猛地感到一种骇人的恐怖——他丧失了感觉的能力。他能推理；他能读书，譬如他能轻而易举读懂但丁的著作（“塞普蒂默斯，放下你的书。”雷齐娅边说边温柔地合上《地狱篇》）；他能算清账目。他的头脑完好无损，那么一定是这个世界的过失——他丧失了感觉的能力。","“Beautiful!” she would murmur, nudging Septimus, that he might see.But beauty was behind a pane of glass.Even taste (Rezia liked ices, chocolates, sweet things) had no relish to him.He put down his cup on the little marble table.He looked at people outside; happy they seemed, collecting in the middle of the street, shouting, laughing, squabbling over nothing.But he could not taste, he could not feel.In the tea-shop among the tables and the chattering waiters the appalling fear came over him—he could not feel.He could reason; he could read, Dante for example, quite easily (“Septimus, do put down your book,” said Rezia, gently shutting the @Inferno@), he could add up his bill; his brain was perfect; it must be the fault of the world then—that he could not feel."
"“英国人是如此沉默。”雷齐娅说道。她喜欢这样，她说道。她尊重这些英国人，还想参观伦敦，看看英国马，以及量身定制的衣服。她能想起曾听一位嫁给了英国人、住在索霍区的姨妈说那里的商店有多么精彩。他们坐火车离开纽黑文的时候，塞普蒂默斯从车窗望着英格兰，想道，也许这是可能的，也许世界自身可能就没有意义。","“The English are so silent,” Rezia said.She liked it, she said.She respected these Englishmen, and wanted to see London, and the English horses, and the tailor-made suits, and could remember hearing how wonderful the shops were, from an Aunt who had married and lived in Soho.It might be possible, Septimus thought, looking at England from the train window, as they left Newhaven; it might be possible that the world itself is without meaning."
"在办公室，人们把他晋升到一个重要岗位。他们替他感到自豪，他荣获过十字勋章。“你已尽到自己的职责，该由我们——”布鲁尔先生开始说道，但高兴得说不下去了。他们住进了托特纳姆科特街附近一座令人称羡的宅子。","At the office they advanced him to a post of considerable responsibility.They were proud of him; he had won crosses.“You have done your duty; it is up to us—” began Mr. Brewer; and could not finish, so pleasurable was his emotion.They took admirable lodgings off the Tottenham Court Road."
"在这里，他再次翻开莎士比亚的书。孩提时代对语言的沉醉——《安东尼和克莱奥帕特拉》——完全凋零了。莎士比亚是那么憎恶人类——穿衣、生孩子、口腹的污秽！此刻，蕴藏在这些美丽词藻下的信息被揭示在塞普蒂默斯面前。在伪装之下，一代人传给下一代人的秘密信息乃是憎恶、仇恨、绝望。但丁亦是如此。埃斯库罗斯（译名）也是这样。雷齐娅坐在桌边修饰帽子。她为菲尔默夫人的朋友修饰帽子。她一个小时接着一个小时地修饰着帽子。她看起来苍白、神秘、如水下淹没的一朵百合，他这样想着。","Here he opened Shakespeare once more.That boy’s business of the intoxication of language—@Antony and Cleopatra@—had shrivelled utterly.How Shakespeare loathed humanity—the putting on of clothes, the getting of children, the sordidity of the mouth and the belly!This was now revealed to Septimus; the message hidden in the beauty of words.The secret signal which one generation passes, under disguise, to the next is loathing, hatred, despair.Dante the same.Aeschylus (translated) the same.There Rezia sat at the table trimming hats.She trimmed hats for Mrs. Filmer’s friends; she trimmed hats by the hour.She looked pale, mysterious, like a lily, drowned, under water, he thought."
"“英国人很是严肃。”她会边说边用手臂搂住塞普蒂默斯，她的脸贴在他脸上。","“The English are so serious,” she would say, putting her arms round Septimus, her cheek against his."
"莎士比亚憎恶男女之间的爱。两性间的勾当对他来说早就是污秽的。不过，雷齐娅说，她必须要生个小孩。他俩结为夫妻五年了。","Love between man and woman was repulsive to Shakespeare.The business of copulation was filth to him before the end.But, Rezia said, she must have children.They had been married five years."
"他俩一起去参观了伦敦塔，游览了维多利亚和艾伯特博物馆，站在人群中看国王主持议会的开幕。还有这些商店——帽店、服装店、橱窗中陈列皮包的店铺，她会站在那里直勾勾地看着。可是她必须要生个男孩。","They went to the Tower together; to the Victoria and Albert Museum; stood in the crowd to see the King open Parliament.And there were the shops—hat shops, dress shops, shops with leather bags in the window, where she would stand staring.But she must have a boy."
"她必须要生个长得像塞普蒂默斯的男孩，她说道。但没有谁能像塞普蒂默斯那样，那么温和、那么庄重、那么聪明。难道她不能阅读莎士比亚的著作么？莎士比亚是一个难懂的作家么？她问道。","She must have a son like Septimus, she said.But nobody could be like Septimus; so gentle; so serious; so clever.Could she not read Shakespeare too?Was Shakespeare a difficult author?she asked."
"一个人不能使孩子出生在这样的世界。一个人不能使痛苦永远持续，也不能为这些满怀淫欲的动物繁衍后代，他们缺乏恒久的情感，唯有奇想和虚荣，使他们不时在这边那边之间回旋。","One cannot bring children into a world like this.One cannot perpetuate suffering, or increase the breed of these lustful animals, who have no lasting emotions, but only whims and vanities, eddying them now this way, now that."
"他注视着雷齐娅裁剪、塑型，好比观察一只鸟在草丛中跳跃，轻快飞舞，不敢动一下手指头。因为真理就是（任由她忽略它吧）人类既没有善良，也没有信仰，更没有宽容，只有寻求眼前更多的愉悦。他们一伙伙地去打猎。他们一伙伙走遍沙漠去搜寻，发出尖叫声，消失在荒漠中。他们把死者遗弃。他们用怪相掩饰自己。说到办公室的布鲁尔，他的胡子打了蜡，装饰着珊瑚领带别针，身穿白色长内衣，有着使人愉悦的感情——心里却是一片冷淡和漠然——他的天竺葵在战争中被毁坏——他厨师的神经被摧垮。或者一个叫什么阿梅莉亚的女子，按时在五点整给人们递茶——一个爱抛媚眼、态度轻蔑、伤风败俗的小荡妇。还有那些身穿浆得笔挺的假前胸的汤姆和伯蒂们，渗出一滴滴深重的罪恶。他们从没看到过他把他们古怪滑稽的裸体丑态描绘在笔记本上。街上，货车呼啸着在他身旁驶过。招贴牌上宣告了残暴的行径——男人身陷矿井，女人活活被烧。还有一次，一群残废的疯子在托特纳姆科特街举行操练或演示以供民众消遣（人们放声大笑）。他们在他身旁从容地走过，咧嘴笑着朝他点头，每一个人都半抱歉半得意地把无助的悲哀强加给人们。他会变疯吗？","He watched her snip, shape, as one watches a bird hop, flit in the grass, without daring to move a finger.For the truth is (let her ignore it) that human beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor charity beyond what serves to increase the pleasure of the moment.They hunt in packs.Their packs scour the desert and vanish screaming into the wilderness.They desert the fallen.They are plastered over with grimaces.There was Brewer at the office, with his waxed moustache, coral tie-pin, white slip, and pleasurable emotions—all coldness and clamminess within,—his geraniums ruined in the War—his cook’s nerves destroyed; or Amelia What’shername, handing round cups of tea punctually at five—a leering, sneering obscene little harpy; and the Toms and Berties in their starched shirt fronts oozing thick drops of vice.They never saw him drawing pictures of them naked at their antics in his notebook.In the street, vans roared past him; brutality blared out on placards; men were trapped in mines; women burnt alive; and once a maimed file of lunatics being exercised or displayed for the diversion of the populace (who laughed aloud), ambled and nodded and grinned past him, in the Tottenham Court Road, each half apologetically, yet triumphantly, inflicting his hopeless woe.And would HE go mad?"
"喝茶时雷齐娅告诉他说菲尔默夫人的女儿快生孩子了。她绝不能没有孩子，就这样变老！她很孤独，她很不幸福！他们结婚以后她还是第一次哭泣。他在远处听见她的啜泣声，他确实听见了、也清楚地注意到这哭声，他把这比作活塞的重击声。可他毫无感觉。","At tea Rezia told him that Mrs. Filmer’s daughter was expecting a baby.SHE could not grow old and have no children!She was very lonely, she was very unhappy!She cried for the first time since they were married.Far away he heard her sobbing; he heard it accurately, he noticed it distinctly; he compared it to a piston thumping.But he felt nothing."
"他的妻子在哭，而他毫无感觉。但每一次她如此深切、默然、无望地哭泣时，他就又往地狱下沉了一步。","His wife was crying, and he felt nothing; only each time she sobbed in this profound, this silent, this hopeless way, he descended another step into the pit."
"终于，他把头埋入手中，这是一个机械的夸张姿势，他完全明白它的虚伪。此刻他已投降了，此刻其他人一定得来帮助他。一定要找人来。他屈从了。","At last, with a melodramatic gesture which he assumed mechanically and with complete consciousness of its insincerity, he dropped his head on his hands.Now he had surrendered; now other people must help him.People must be sent for.He gave in."
"没有什么能唤醒他。雷齐娅扶他上床。她请来一位医生——为菲尔默夫人治病的霍姆斯医生。霍姆斯医生仔细检查了他的身体。没什么要紧的，霍姆斯医生说。噢，真是一剂安慰！多善良的人，多好心的人啊！雷齐娅心想。他有这种感觉的时候，就去音乐厅。霍姆斯医生说道。他与妻子一同休假一天，打了高尔夫球。怎么不尝试在就寝时喝下两片溶解在水杯里的溴化物镇静剂呢？布卢姆斯伯里区的这些老宅子，霍姆斯医生敲了敲墙壁说道，常嵌满了精致的镶板，房东却愚笨地糊上了墙纸。仅在前几天，他去贝德福德广场探望了一个叫某某爵士的病人——","Nothing could rouse him.Rezia put him to bed.She sent for a doctor—Mrs. Filmer’s Dr. Holmes.Dr. Holmes examined him.There was nothing whatever the matter, said Dr. Holmes.Oh, what a relief!What a kind man, what a good man! thought Rezia.When he felt like that he went to the Music Hall, said Dr. Holmes.He took a day off with his wife and played golf.Why not try two tabloids of bromide dissolved in a glass of water at bedtime?These old Bloomsbury houses, said Dr. Holmes, tapping the wall, are often full of very fine panelling, which the landlords have the folly to paper over.Only the other day, visiting a patient, Sir Somebody Something in Bedford Square—"
"那么没什么借口了，没什么要紧的，除了他被人性判决了死刑的那桩罪过，就是让他丧失了感觉的能力。他在埃文斯战死的时候满不在乎，那就是最严重的罪过。然而其他一切罪行都在黎明时刻在床栏边仰起头，挥舞手指，对着那躺卧的身体冷嘲热讽。他躺在床上意识到自身堕落了。他是怎样娶了自己并不爱慕的妻子。他撒谎骗她，引诱她，激怒了伊莎贝尔·波尔小姐，他身上布满斑斑点点的罪恶印迹。女人们在街上见到他就会战栗。人性对如此卑劣的一个人判处的是死刑。","So there was no excuse; nothing whatever the matter, except the sin for which human nature had condemned him to death; that he did not feel.He had not cared when Evans was killed; that was worst; but all the other crimes raised their heads and shook their fingers and jeered and sneered over the rail of the bed in the early hours of the morning at the prostrate body which lay realising its degradation; how he had married his wife without loving her; had lied to her; seduced her; outraged Miss Isabel Pole, and was so pocked and marked with vice that women shuddered when they saw him in the street.The verdict of human nature on such a wretch was death."
"霍姆斯医生又来为他治病。他身材高大，气色红润，英俊帅气。他轻掸靴子，在镜前照照，说一切都无关紧要——头痛、失眠、害怕、多梦——他说这些仅是神经质的症候，没什么其他的。假如霍姆斯医生觉得自身重量低于一百六十磅哪怕半磅，他就要在早饭时让妻子再来一碟麦片粥。（雷齐娅要学会做麦片粥。）然而，他又讲，健康在很大程度上是由我们自己掌控的。让自己对外部事物产生兴趣，形成某个爱好。他打开莎士比亚的戏剧——《安东尼和克莱奥帕特拉》，又把莎士比亚的书推在一边。某个爱好，霍姆斯医生说道，因为他自己非常健康的体格（他像任何伦敦的人那样辛苦地工作）不该归因于这个事实吗？他总是可以把重心从他的病人转到古董家具上。要是可以的话，他会这样说，沃伦·史密斯夫人佩戴的梳子多好看啊！","Dr. Holmes came again.Large, fresh coloured, handsome, flicking his boots, looking in the glass, he brushed it all aside—headaches, sleeplessness, fears, dreams—nerve symptoms and nothing more, he said.If Dr. Holmes found himself even half a pound below eleven stone six, he asked his wife for another plate of porridge at breakfast.(Rezia would learn to cook porridge.) But, he continued, health is largely a matter in our own control.Throw yourself into outside interests; take up some hobby.He opened Shakespeare—@Antony and Cleopatra@; pushed Shakespeare aside.Some hobby, said Dr. Holmes, for did he not owe his own excellent health (and he worked as hard as any man in London) to the fact that he could always switch off from his patients on to old furniture?And what a very pretty comb, if he might say so, Mrs. Warren Smith was wearing!"
"那讨厌的傻瓜又来的时候，塞普蒂默斯拒绝与他会面。他确实不愿看到我？霍姆斯医生说道，欣然微笑。他实在是只好将娇小迷人的史密斯夫人友善地推开，然后才能从她身旁过去，走进她丈夫的卧室。","When the damned fool came again, Septimus refused to see him.Did he indeed? said Dr. Holmes, smiling agreeably.Really he had to give that charming little lady, Mrs. Smith, a friendly push before he could get past her into her husband’s bedroom."
"“那么你害怕了。”他欣然说道，坐在病人身边。他确实对妻子说过要自杀，多好的姑娘，又是个外国人，难道不是么？难道那不会让她对英国的丈夫们产生一种异常古怪的想法吗？一个人难道不应对自己的妻子负某种责任吗？去做点什么事，而不是在床上躺着不是更好吗？因为他身后已有四十年的经验了。塞普蒂默斯能信任霍姆斯医生说的话——他的身体没什么要紧的。霍姆斯医生再来的时候期望见到史密斯已从床上下来，别再让他娇小迷人的妻子担心他了。","“So you’re in a funk,” he said agreeably, sitting down by his patient’s side.He had actually talked of killing himself to his wife, quite a girl, a foreigner, wasn’t she?Didn’t that give her a very odd idea of English husbands?Didn’t one owe perhaps a duty to one’s wife?Wouldn’t it be better to do something instead of lying in bed?For he had had forty years’ experience behind him; and Septimus could take Dr. Holmes’s word for it—there was nothing whatever the matter with him.And next time Dr. Holmes came he hoped to find Smith out of bed and not making that charming little lady his wife anxious about him."
"简而言之，人性——那鼻孔血红、面目可憎的畜生攫住了他。霍姆斯攫住了他。霍姆斯医生很按时地每天都来。一旦你绊倒了，塞普蒂默斯在一张明信片后面写着，人性就会攫住你。霍姆斯就会攫住你。他们仅有的活路就是逃走，别让霍姆斯知晓。逃去意大利——无论何处，无论哪里，离开霍姆斯医生。","Human nature, in short, was on him—the repulsive brute, with the blood-red nostrils.Holmes was on him.Dr. Holmes came quite regularly every day.Once you stumble, Septimus wrote on the back of a postcard, human nature is on you.Holmes is on you.Their only chance was to escape, without letting Holmes know; to Italy—anywhere, anywhere, away from Dr. Holmes."
"可是雷齐娅不能理解他。霍姆斯医生是如此善良的人。他对塞普蒂默斯百般关怀。他只是想要帮助他们，他说道。她告诉塞普蒂默斯说，他有四个小孩子，他曾邀请她喝茶。","But Rezia could not understand him.Dr. Holmes was such a kind man.He was so interested in Septimus.He only wanted to help them, he said.He had four little children and he had asked her to tea, she told Septimus."
"就这样他遭到遗弃。全世界都在大声叫喊：自杀吧，自杀吧，为了我们。但为何他要为他们而自杀呢？食物是美味的，阳光灼热。而自杀呢，怎样进行这种事？用一把餐刀，鲜血汩汩，太难看了；吸煤气管呢？他极端无力，几乎连手也举不起来。而且，既然他已被定罪，被遗弃，极端孤寂，如同濒死之人那样孤独，这孤独之中却有一种享受，充满崇高的与世隔绝，一种有牵挂之人永不能理解的自由。霍姆斯当然赢了，那鼻孔血红的畜生赢了。然而即使霍姆斯自己也不能伤害这浪迹四方的最后的残存者，这遭到社会遗弃的人，他回眸注视着人间，他就像一个淹死的水手，躺在世界的岸边。","So he was deserted.The whole world was clamouring: Kill yourself, kill yourself, for our sakes.But why should he kill himself for their sakes?Food was pleasant; the sun hot; and this killing oneself, how does one set about it, with a table knife, uglily, with floods of blood,—by sucking a gaspipe?He was too weak; he could scarcely raise his hand.Besides, now that he was quite alone, condemned, deserted, as those who are about to die are alone, there was a luxury in it, an isolation full of sublimity; a freedom which the attached can never know.Holmes had won of course; the brute with the red nostrils had won.But even Holmes himself could not touch this last relic straying on the edge of the world, this outcast, who gazed back at the inhabited regions, who lay, like a drowned sailor, on the shore of the world."
"就在那一刻（雷齐娅买东西去了），伟大的启示出现了。帘幕之后有一个声音传出。埃文斯在讲话。死去的人和他在一起。","It was at that moment (Rezia gone shopping) that the great revelation took place.A voice spoke from behind the screen.Evans was speaking.The dead were with him."
"“埃文斯，埃文斯！”他大喊。","“Evans, Evans!” he cried."
"史密斯先生在高声地喃喃自语，侍女阿格尼丝在厨房中对菲尔默夫人说道。“埃文斯，埃文斯。”她端盘子进来的时候，他在喊。她吃惊地一跳，她确实跳了起来。她快速跑下楼。","Mr. Smith was talking aloud to himself, Agnes the servant girl cried to Mrs. Filmer in the kitchen.“Evans, Evans,” he had said as she brought in the tray.She jumped, she did.She scuttled downstairs."
"雷齐娅走进来，手捧鲜花，穿过屋子，将玫瑰插入花瓶，太阳直射在花上。阳光在屋内笑着，跳着。","And Rezia came in, with her flowers, and walked across the room, and put the roses in a vase, upon which the sun struck directly, and it went laughing, leaping round the room."
"她不得不从街上一个穷人手中买下那些玫瑰，雷齐娅解释道。不过花几乎都已枯萎了，她说，一边摆弄玫瑰。","She had had to buy the roses, Rezia said, from a poor man in the street.But they were almost dead already, she said, arranging the roses."
"那么外面有个人，可能就是埃文斯。而雷齐娅说的快要枯萎了的玫瑰，就是他在希腊的田野里采的。“交流即是健康，交流即是幸福，交流——”他轻声低语。","So there was a man outside; Evans presumably; and the roses, which Rezia said were half dead, had been picked by him in the fields of Greece.“Communication is health; communication is happiness, communication—” he muttered."
"“你说什么，塞普蒂默斯？”雷齐娅问，她吓疯了，因为他在喃喃自语。","“What are you saying, Septimus?”Rezia asked, wild with terror, for he was talking to himself."
"她派阿格尼丝跑去请霍姆斯医生。她说她丈夫发了疯。简直连她也不认识了。","She sent Agnes running for Dr. Holmes.Her husband, she said, was mad.He scarcely knew her."
"“你这个畜生！你这个畜生！”塞普蒂默斯大叫，因为他看到了人性，即霍姆斯医生，进屋来了。","“You brute!You brute!” cried Septimus, seeing human nature, that is Dr. Holmes, enter the room."
"“哎！又发生什么了？”霍姆斯医生的说话方式是世上最温和的。“胡说八道来吓你的妻子吗？”但霍姆斯会给他服些药使他入睡。要是他们是富裕之人，霍姆斯医生说，一边嘲讽地环视一下屋子，假若他们不相信他，他们当然可以到哈利街去求医。霍姆斯医生说这话时，看起来就没那么友好了。","“Now what’s all this about?” said Dr. Holmes in the most amiable way in the world.“Talking nonsense to frighten your wife?”But he would give him something to make him sleep.And if they were rich people, said Dr. Holmes, looking ironically round the room, by all means let them go to Harley Street; if they had no confidence in him, said Dr. Holmes, looking not quite so kind."
"时间恰好是十二点钟，大本钟敲了十二下。它的钟声飘扬过伦敦北部，与其他钟声混合，又轻薄飘渺地与云朵和一缕缕烟雾融合，在海鸥群中渐渐消逝——十二点的钟声响起时，克拉丽莎·达洛维正把她的绿色裙子放在床上，沃伦·史密斯夫妇也走上了哈利街。十二点是他们约定的时刻。雷齐娅心想，那可能就是威廉·布拉德肖爵士的住所，房前停着一辆灰色汽车。一圈圈铅般沉重的音波消逝在空中。","It was precisely twelve o’clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke, and died up there among the seagulls—twelve o’clock struck as Clarissa Dalloway laid her green dress on her bed, and the Warren Smiths walked down Harley Street.Twelve was the hour of their appointment.Probably, Rezia thought, that was Sir William Bradshaw’s house with the grey motor car in front of it.The leaden circles dissolved in the air."
"的确如此——是威廉·布拉德肖爵士的汽车。车身矮、马力大、颜色灰白，车门板上简洁地刻着相互连结着的他名字的缩写。好像卖弄家族纹章是不适宜的，因为他是神灵的帮手，是散播科学的传教士。由于汽车是灰色的，为匹配它庄重柔和的色泽，车里放有一堆堆灰毛皮，小银灰毯子，以便使爵士夫人等候时可以取暖。因为威廉爵士往往行驶六十英里或更远到乡下去为富裕的病人出诊，他们能负担得起威廉爵士恰如其分地收取的高额诊疗费。爵士夫人用小毯子裹住膝盖等候一小时或更长的时间。她仰靠在座位上，不时想着病人，不时又可原谅地想着一面金墙，在她等候时每分钟都在增高。这面金墙在他俩和一切变换世事及焦灼不安（她曾经勇敢地忍受这些，他俩曾经艰苦地奋斗）之间不断升高，直至她觉得自身牢牢地嵌在宁静的海洋上，那里只有馨香的风在拂动。她受人尊重、赞赏、羡慕，她想要的几乎都有，虽然她惋惜自己的肥硕。每周四晚他俩都要举办大型晚宴来款待同行，间或主持义卖市场开幕，受过皇族接待。哎呀，与丈夫相聚的时光太短了。他的工作愈来愈忙。他们有个儿子在伊顿公学学习很出色。她原本还想生个女儿。不过，她有很多兴趣爱好：如儿童福利，癫痫患者病后护理和治疗，以及摄影。所以她在等待的时候，要是有一个在建的教堂，或者一个就要坍塌的教堂，她便会贿赂教堂的司事，拿到钥匙去里面拍照。她拍摄的照片简直能与职业摄影师的作品匹敌。","Indeed it was—Sir William Bradshaw’s motor car; low, powerful, grey with plain initials’ interlocked on the panel, as if the pomps of heraldry were incongruous, this man being the ghostly helper, the priest of science; and, as the motor car was grey, so to match its sober suavity, grey furs, silver grey rugs were heaped in it, to keep her ladyship warm while she waited.For often Sir William would travel sixty miles or more down into the country to visit the rich, the afflicted, who could afford the very large fee which Sir William very properly charged for his advice.Her ladyship waited with the rugs about her knees an hour or more, leaning back, thinking sometimes of the patient, sometimes, excusably, of the wall of gold, mounting minute by minute while she waited; the wall of gold that was mounting between them and all shifts and anxieties (she had borne them bravely; they had had their struggles) until she felt wedged on a calm ocean, where only spice winds blow; respected, admired, envied, with scarcely anything left to wish for, though she regretted her stoutness; large dinner-parties every Thursday night to the profession; an occasional bazaar to be opened; Royalty greeted; too little time, alas, with her husband, whose work grew and grew; a boy doing well at Eton; she would have liked a daughter too; interests she had, however, in plenty; child welfare; the after-care of the epileptic, and photography, so that if there was a church building, or a church decaying, she bribed the sexton, got the key and took photographs, which were scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals, while she waited."
"威廉爵士自己已不再年轻。他曾竭力工作。他的地位全是凭他的才能赢得的（他是一个店主的儿子）。他热爱自己的职业，在各种庆祝典礼上是个很好的傀儡人物，口才很好——直到他受封爵士时，一切奋斗让他满脸沉重、疲乏（川流不息的病人是那样没有穷尽，医生的职责和特权是那样艰巨）。这疲惫的面孔连同他灰白的头发，增添了他非同寻常的形象特征，为他带来名誉（对治疗神经类病症至关重要）。他不只具有闪电般的技能，以及几近万无一失的精确诊断，还有同情心，机敏老练，洞察人类灵魂。他俩进屋的那一刻他就一目了然（他俩就是沃伦·史密斯夫妇）。他一见到那个男子就能确定，这是一个极端严重的病例。这是一个完全崩溃的病例——身体和神经完全崩溃，每种症候都表明这是病情晚期。他两三分钟的功夫就确诊了病情（他小心地低声提问，将答案记在一张粉红色的卡片上）。","Sir William himself was no longer young.He had worked very hard; he had won his position by sheer ability (being the son of a shopkeeper); loved his profession; made a fine figurehead at ceremonies and spoke well—all of which had by the time he was knighted given him a heavy look, a weary look (the stream of patients being so incessant, the responsibilities and privileges of his profession so onerous), which weariness, together with his grey hairs, increased the extraordinary distinction of his presence and gave him the reputation (of the utmost importance in dealing with nerve cases) not merely of lightning skill, and almost infallible accuracy in diagnosis but of sympathy; tact; understanding of the human soul.He could see the first moment they came into the room (the Warren Smiths they were called); he was certain directly he saw the man; it was a case of extreme gravity.It was a case of complete breakdown—complete physical and nervous breakdown, with every symptom in an advanced stage, he ascertained in two or three minutes (writing answers to questions, murmured discreetly, on a pink card)."
"霍姆斯医生为他治疗了多长时间？六周了。","How long had Dr. Holmes been attending him?Six weeks."
"开了少许溴化物镇静剂吗？还说没什么要紧吗？哦，是啊（那些普通医师！威廉爵士想。他花了半数时间纠正他们犯下的大错。有的是不可补救的）。","Prescribed a little bromide?Said there was nothing the matter?Ah yes (those general practitioners! thought Sir William.It took half his time to undo their blunders.Some were irreparable)."
"“你在战争中有很杰出的表现吗？”","“You served with great distinction in the War?”"
"病人疑问地重复“战争”一词。","The patient repeated the word “war” interrogatively."
"他正在给有象征意义的词语附上一些其他的意思。一种严重的症候，该记入病历卡。","He was attaching meanings to words of a symbolical kind.A serious symptom, to be noted on the card."
"“战争？”病人问。欧洲战争——是学生们用火药惹出的小骚动吗？他服役时有杰出的表现吗？他确实忘了。他败在战争本身。","“The War?” the patient asked.The European War—that little shindy of schoolboys with gunpowder?Had he served with distinction?He really forgot.In the War itself he had failed."
"“不错，他服役时有杰出的表现。”雷齐娅向医生证实，“他获得了晋升。”","“Yes, he served with the greatest distinction,” Rezia assured the doctor; “he was promoted.”"
"“在你的办公室，人们对你也有极高评价吗？”威廉爵士低声问道，瞥了一下布鲁尔先生的那封满是溢美之词的信。“那么你没什么需要烦恼，不存在经济上的担忧，没什么问题吗？”","“And they have the very highest opinion of you at your office?”Sir William murmured, glancing at Mr. Brewer’s very generously worded letter.“So that you have nothing to worry you, no financial anxiety, nothing?”"
"他犯了一桩骇人的罪，人性判决他死刑。","He had committed an appalling crime and been condemned to death by human nature."
"“我已——我已，”他开始发言，“犯了一桩罪——”","“I have—I have,” he began, “committed a crime—”"
"“他没犯过什么过失。”雷齐娅向医生保证。要是史密斯先生可以等等，威廉爵士说，他愿意同史密斯夫人在隔壁屋子谈谈。她丈夫病情十分严重，威廉爵士说。他是否恐吓说要自杀？","“He has done nothing wrong whatever,” Rezia assured the doctor.If Mr. Smith would wait, said Sir William, he would speak to Mrs. Smith in the next room.Her husband was very seriously ill, Sir William said.Did he threaten to kill himself?"
"噢，他这么说过，她哭着说。不过他并非想要这样，她说道。当然不是这样的。这仅仅是一个休养问题，威廉爵士说道。休养、休养、休养、在床上长期休养。在乡下有一处令人愉快的休养院，在那里她丈夫会得到很好的照顾。让他远离她吗？她问道。真不幸，是的。我们最在乎的人在我们患病时对我们并无好处。但他没疯，不是吗？威廉爵士称他从未说过“疯狂”一词，他称之为没有平衡感。可她丈夫讨厌医生。他会拒绝到休养院去的。威廉爵士简略又亲切地向她说明病状。他曾恐吓说要自杀。没别的选择。这是个法律问题。他会在乡下一座美丽的宅子里卧床休养。那些护士很出色。威廉爵士每周会去探望他一次。要是沃伦·史密斯夫人确定没有别的问题要问——他从不催促他的病人——他们就回到她丈夫那里。她不再提问了——不再询问威廉爵士了。","Oh, he did, she cried.But he did not mean it, she said.Of course not.It was merely a question of rest, said Sir William; of rest, rest, rest; a long rest in bed.There was a delightful home down in the country where her husband would be perfectly looked after.Away from her? she asked.Unfortunately, yes; the people we care for most are not good for us when we are ill.But he was not mad, was he?Sir William said he never spoke of “madness”; he called it not having a sense of proportion.But her husband did not like doctors.He would refuse to go there.Shortly and kindly Sir William explained to her the state of the case.He had threatened to kill himself.There was no alternative.It was a question of law.He would lie in bed in a beautiful house in the country.The nurses were admirable.Sir William would visit him once a week.If Mrs. Warren Smith was quite sure she had no more questions to ask—he never hurried his patients—they would return to her husband.She had nothing more to ask—not of Sir William."
"所以他们返回了人类中最崇高的那个人那里。他是面向法官的罪人、暴露在高处的受害者、亡命之人、溺死的水手、不朽颂歌的诗作者、由生入死的上帝。塞普蒂默斯·沃伦·史密斯坐在天窗下的扶手椅上，凝视着布拉德肖女士穿宫廷服的照片，低声咕哝着关于美的言语。","So they returned to the most exalted of mankind; the criminal who faced his judges; the victim exposed on the heights; the fugitive; the drowned sailor; the poet of the immortal ode; the Lord who had gone from life to death; to Septimus Warren Smith, who sat in the arm-chair under the skylight staring at a photograph of Lady Bradshaw in Court dress, muttering messages about beauty."
"“我们略谈了一会。”威廉爵士说道。“他说你的病情十分十分严重。”雷齐娅高声说道。","“We have had our little talk,” said Sir William.“He says you are very, very ill,” Rezia cried."
"“我们准备安排你去一个休养院。”威廉爵士说道。“霍姆斯办的休养院中的一个吗？”塞普蒂默斯讥笑着。","“We have been arranging that you should go into a home,” said Sir William.“One of Holmes’s homes?” sneered Septimus."
"这个家伙留下的印象令人不愉快。因为威廉爵士之父是一个商人，他对教养与装扮有一种自然的敬重，衣衫不整会惹怒他。此外，更深层的原因是，威廉爵士从没时间阅读，对有教养的人有一种深埋心底的怨恨。那些人走进他的诊疗室，暗示医生并非是受到过教育的人，虽然这个职业需要才智超凡的人持续紧绷的精力。","The fellow made a distasteful impression.For there was in Sir William, whose father had been a tradesman, a natural respect for breeding and clothing, which shabbiness nettled; again, more profoundly, there was in Sir William, who had never had time for reading, a grudge, deeply buried, against cultivated people who came into his room and intimated that doctors, whose profession is a constant strain upon all the highest faculties, are not educated men."
"“是我的一个休养院，沃伦·史密斯先生。”他说，“我们将在那里教你如何休养。”","“One of MY homes, Mr. Warren Smith,” he said, “where we will teach you to rest.”"
"仅还有一桩事情了。","And there was just one thing more."
"他非常肯定沃伦·史密斯先生病好时，会是世上最不愿吓唬自己妻子的人。但他曾谈及自杀。","He was quite certain that when Mr. Warren Smith was well he was the last man in the world to frighten his wife.But he had talked of killing himself."
"“我们都有消沉的时刻。”威廉爵士说道。","“We all have our moments of depression,” said Sir William."
"一旦你堕落了，塞普蒂默斯自言自语重复道，人性就会把你攫住。霍姆斯和布拉德肖就会把你攫住。他们走遍沙漠去搜寻。他们尖啸着在荒漠中飞奔。他们用刑架和拇指夹来惩罚。人性冷酷无情。","Once you fall, Septimus repeated to himself, human nature is on you.Holmes and Bradshaw are on you.They scour the desert.They fly screaming into the wilderness.The rack and the thumbscrew are applied.Human nature is remorseless."
"“他有时会突然冲动吗？”威廉爵士问，他把铅笔放在粉红病历卡上。","“Impulses came upon him sometimes?”Sir William asked, with his pencil on a pink card."
"那是他本人的事，塞普蒂默斯回答。","That was his own affair, said Septimus."
"“没人只为自己而活。”威廉爵士说道，瞥了一下他妻子身着宫廷服的照片。","“Nobody lives for himself alone,” said Sir William, glancing at the photograph of his wife in Court dress."
"“你的前面还有光明的事业。”威廉爵士说道。布鲁尔先生的信放在桌上。“非常光明的事业。”","“And you have a brilliant career before you,” said Sir William.There was Mr. Brewer’s letter on the table.“An exceptionally brilliant career.”"
"但假如他忏悔呢？假如他说出想法呢？那么，他的折磨者们会饶过他吗？","But if he confessed?If he communicated?Would they let him off then, his torturers?"
"“我——我——”他结巴地说。","“I—I—” he stammered."
"但他的罪行是什么？他无法想起。","But what was his crime?He could not remember it."
"“什么？”威廉爵士鼓励他说。（但是时间渐渐晚了。）爱、树木、没有罪行——他想传达什么？他无法想起。","“Yes?” Sir William encouraged him.(But it was growing late.) Love, trees, there is no crime—what was his message?He could not remember it."
"“我——我——”塞普蒂默斯结巴地说。","“I—I—” Septimus stammered."
"“尽可能少想自己。”威廉爵士亲切地说。确实，他不宜四处走动。","“Try to think as little about yourself as possible,” said Sir William kindly.Really, he was not fit to be about."
"他们还有别的事想问他吗？威廉爵士会做好一切安排（他对雷齐娅小声说道），他会于那晚五六点钟之间告诉她的，他小声说。","Was there anything else they wished to ask him?Sir William would make all arrangements (he murmured to Rezia) and he would let her know between five and six that evening he murmured."
"“把一切都托付于我吧。”他说道，随后便打发他们走了。","“Trust everything to me,” he said, and dismissed them."
"雷齐娅的一生从未受过如此巨大的痛苦，从来没有！她请求帮助却为人所弃！他令他们失望！威廉·布拉德肖爵士并非一个友好的人。","Never, never had Rezia felt such agony in her life!She had asked for help and been deserted!He had failed them!Sir William Bradshaw was not a nice man."
"仅是那汽车的保养必定使他花销不菲，塞普蒂默斯说，此时他们已经出来走到了街上。","The upkeep of that motor car alone must cost him quite a lot, said Septimus, when they got out into the street."
"她抱紧他一只手臂。他们被遗弃了。","She clung to his arm.They had been deserted."
"可是她还想要什么呢？","But what more did she want?"
"他给病人的时间是三刻钟。假如在这门缜密的科学里，毕竟这是一个我们对之一无所知的领域——神经系统、人类大脑——一个医生丧失了平衡感，就是一个失败的医生。健康是我们肯定需要的，而健康就表示平衡。所以当有人进入你的诊疗室并称他就是基督（一个普遍的幻觉），还带来了启示，像他们大都有启示一样，并如他们经常所做的一样威胁要自杀，你就得采取平衡的方法，命令病人上床休息，独自休息，静养，休息时不会见朋友，不看书，不交流。修养六个月，直到以一百零五磅的体重进来的病人以一百六十八磅的重量出院。","To his patients he gave three-quarters of an hour; and if in this exacting science which has to do with what, after all, we know nothing about—the nervous system, the human brain—a doctor loses his sense of proportion, as a doctor he fails.Health we must have; and health is proportion; so that when a man comes into your room and says he is Christ (a common delusion), and has a message, as they mostly have, and threatens, as they often do, to kill himself, you invoke proportion; order rest in bed; rest in solitude; silence and rest; rest without friends, without books, without messages; six months’ rest; until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve."
"平衡，神圣的平衡，真是威廉爵士的女神。它来源于威廉爵士巡视医院，捕大马哈鱼，布拉德肖女士在哈利街生儿子等等的各种时刻。布拉德肖女士自己也要捕大马哈鱼，她拍摄的照片简直能与职业摄影师的作品匹敌。因为他尊崇平衡，威廉爵士不仅自己成功了，也使英国繁荣起来，隔离了英国的疯子，禁止生育，对悲观情绪予以惩罚，使不健全的人不能传播他们的观念，一直到他们也接纳他的平衡感——假如是男性，就接纳他的观念，假如是女性，就接纳布拉德肖女士的观念（她绣花、编织、一周七晚要花四晚在家陪儿子）。所以不仅是他的同事尊重他，下属惧怕他，而且患者的亲朋对他怀着最衷心的感激。因为他坚持这些预言世界末日、或基督显灵的男女基督预言家们，应遵循威廉爵士的命令躺在床上喝牛奶。威廉爵士有三十年诊治这类病例的经验，还有万无一失的直觉，这感觉，就是疯狂；其实，就是他的平衡感。","Proportion, divine proportion, Sir William’s goddess, was acquired by Sir William walking hospitals, catching salmon, begetting one son in Harley Street by Lady Bradshaw, who caught salmon herself and took photographs scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals.Worshipping proportion, Sir William not only prospered himself but made England prosper, secluded her lunatics, forbade childbirth, penalised despair, made it impossible for the unfit to propagate their views until they, too, shared his sense of proportion—his, if they were men, Lady Bradshaw’s if they were women (she embroidered, knitted, spent four nights out of seven at home with her son), so that not only did his colleagues respect him, his subordinates fear him, but the friends and relations of his patients felt for him the keenest gratitude for insisting that these prophetic Christs and Christesses, who prophesied the end of the world, or the advent of God, should drink milk in bed, as Sir William ordered; Sir William with his thirty years’ experience of these kinds of cases, and his infallible instinct, this is madness, this sense; in fact, his sense of proportion."
"不过平衡有个姊妹，不那么爱笑，更让人敬畏，是一个女神，即使此刻也忙于——在印度炎热的沙漠中，在非洲泥泞的沼泽地里，在伦敦的贫民窟内，简而言之，无论何处，只要是在气候或魔鬼诱使人们遗弃自身真实信念的地方——即使此刻也忙于冲毁神龛，打碎圣像而代之以她那严峻的表情。她的名字是信奉，她尽情吞噬弱者的意志，爱惹人注意，对人施压，崇拜自己印刻在民众脸上的容貌。她站在海德公园角的一个桶上传教。她身裹白衣，伪装出兄弟般仁爱的样子悔悟地走过工厂与议会。她提供帮助，但是渴求权力；粗暴地攻击异己或不服的人；恩赐那些仰视她，顺从地从她眼里看见自己的光明的人。这个女神（雷齐娅·沃伦·史密斯预言）还存在于威廉爵士的内心。虽然像大多时候一样，隐藏在某个似乎合理的伪装下，像某个受人尊重的名字，爱、职责、自我牺牲。他会多么努力地工作呀——多么努力地筹款，宣扬改革，兴建机构呀！然而信奉，这个挑剔的女神，喜欢血液胜过砖瓦，还甚为玄妙地尽情吞噬人类的意志。例如，布拉德肖女士。她十五年前已经俯首屈从了。你不能指出任何确切的例子。没有大吵大闹，没有厉声呵斥，唯有她的意志像浸透了水般逐渐消沉，与他的意志融为一体。她带着甜蜜的微笑，快速服从了。哈利街房屋里的晚餐有八九道菜，宴请十或十五位专业人士，她进展得很顺利，待客有礼。唯有晚上她流露出很轻微的呆滞表情，或可能是不安，神经紧张性地抽动，说话支吾、犹豫、慌乱，这些都表明那可怜的夫人撒了谎——要相信这些真是痛苦。曾经，很久以前，她自由地捕起大马哈鱼。现在，为尽快满足能使她丈夫的眼睛闪现出油腻腻光芒的追求控制、追求权力的欲望。她抽搐、挤压、克制、修剪自己，她退缩、窥探。因此，尽管她不明白到底什么导致了晚餐的不愉快，还让她有头昏脑胀的感觉，很可能缘于职业性的交谈，或者缘于那伟大的医生疲劳过度，布拉德肖女士说他的生命“不属于他自己，而属于他的病人”。晚餐总而言之就是使人不愉快。因此，钟声敲响十点的时候，宾客们甚至是满心狂喜吸入哈利街的空气。可是，这种解脱不是他的患者能享受到的。","But Proportion has a sister, less smiling, more formidable, a Goddess even now engaged—in the heat and sands of India, the mud and swamp of Africa, the purlieus of London, wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own—is even now engaged in dashing down shrines, smashing idols, and setting up in their place her own stern countenance.Conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace.At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching; shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments; offers help, but desires power; smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own.This lady too (Rezia Warren Smith divined it) had her dwelling in Sir William’s heart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some plausible disguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice.How he would work—how toil to raise funds, propagate reforms, initiate institutions!But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better than brick, and feasts most subtly on the human will.For example, Lady Bradshaw.Fifteen years ago she had gone under.It was nothing you could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only the slow sinking, water-logged, of her will into his.Sweet was her smile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight or nine courses, feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes, was smooth and urbane.Only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness, or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble, stumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to believe—that the poor lady lied.Once, long ago, she had caught salmon freely: now, quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband’s eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of the head (which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life, Lady Bradshaw said, “is not his own but his patients’”) disagreeable it was: so that guests, when the clock struck ten, breathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief, however, was denied to his patients."
"那间灰色的房间的墙上挂着画，房间内摆设着名贵家具。在磨砂玻璃的天窗之下，患者们了解了自身过错的严重程度。他们在扶手椅中缩成一团，注视着他为了他们的裨益运用手臂进行一种古怪的锻炼。他猛地伸出胳臂，又敏捷地收至臀部，为了证实（假如病人顽固不化）威廉爵士能够操控自己的行动，可病人不能。有些软弱者在诊疗室崩溃了，抽泣着，屈服了。其他人呢，天知道受了什么放纵的、疯狂的刺激，当面咒骂威廉爵士是一个可恶的骗子，甚至更加不恭敬地质疑生命本身。为何要活着？他们想知道。威廉爵士答复说因为生活很美好。对布拉德肖女士而言当然如此。她带着鸵鸟毛帽子拍的照片就悬挂在壁炉架上方。至于他的收入，一年能有一万两千来英镑呢。而对我们而言，病人抗议道，生活并没赋予这样的恩惠。威廉爵士勉强赞同。他们缺少平衡感。可能，归根到底，人间没有上帝吧？他耸耸肩。简而言之，活着还是死亡不是我们自己的事吗？但这一点上病人错了。威廉爵士有位朋友住在萨里，人们在那里教授一项威廉爵士坦率承认很难的艺术——平衡感。另外，还有家庭关怀、荣誉、勇气、以及辉煌的事业。威廉爵士是拥护这一切的坚定战士。假如这些令他失望，他只好支持警察和社会善意。威廉爵士非常平静地说，在萨里，这些力量负责控制反社会冲动行为。这些行动大多是由出身卑微导致的。然后那个女神就会从她的藏匿之处偷偷溜出来，坐上她的御座，她的欲望是镇压反抗，把自己的形象永不磨灭地印刻在别人的圣殿上。那些赤裸裸、不能自卫、疲惫不堪、无依无靠的人因此便对威廉爵士的意志留下了深刻的印象。他猛扑上去，狼吞虎咽。他把人关紧闭。正是这样的决心和人道的结合使威廉爵士如此受到他的受害者亲属的钟爱。","There in the grey room, with the pictures on the wall, and the valuable furniture, under the ground glass skylight, they learnt the extent of their transgressions; huddled up in arm-chairs, they watched him go through, for their benefit, a curious exercise with the arms, which he shot out, brought sharply back to his hip, to prove (if the patient was obstinate) that Sir William was master of his own actions, which the patient was not.There some weakly broke down; sobbed, submitted; others, inspired by Heaven knows what intemperate madness, called Sir William to his face a damnable humbug; questioned, even more impiously, life itself.Why live? they demanded.Sir William replied that life was good.Certainly Lady Bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece, and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year.But to us, they protested, life has given no such bounty.He acquiesced.They lacked a sense of proportion.And perhaps, after all, there is no God?He shrugged his shoulders.In short, this living or not living is an affair of our own?But there they were mistaken.Sir William had a friend in Surrey where they taught, what Sir William frankly admitted was a difficult art—a sense of proportion.There were, moreover, family affection; honour; courage; and a brilliant career.All of these had in Sir William a resolute champion.If they failed him, he had to support police and the good of society, which, he remarked very quietly, would take care, down in Surrey, that these unsocial impulses, bred more than anything by the lack of good blood, were held in control.And then stole out from her hiding-place and mounted her throne that Goddess whose lust is to override opposition, to stamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself.Naked, defenceless, the exhausted, the friendless received the impress of Sir William’s will.He swooped; he devoured.He shut people up.It was this combination of decision and humanity that endeared Sir William so greatly to the relations of his victims."
"但雷齐娅·沃伦·史密斯在哈利街上前行时喊道，她并不喜欢那个人。","But Rezia Warren Smith cried, walking down Harley Street, that she did not like that man."
"哈利街上的钟声蚕食着六月的这一天，将其切条成片，分了再分，在劝人屈服、拥护权威，齐鸣宣告平衡感至高无上的优越性，直到大量的报时声减弱到只剩下悬挂在牛津街一家商店上头的广告钟温柔友好地鸣响一点半的钟声，似乎里格比先生和郎兹先生乐意无偿提供时讯。","Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of Harley Street nibbled at the June day, counselled submission, upheld authority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion, until the mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock, suspended above a shop in Oxford Street, announced, genially and fraternally, as if it were a pleasure to Messrs. Rigby and Lowndes to give the information gratis, that it was half-past one."
"向上望去，看来里格比与郎兹的每个字母都表示一个时刻。潜意识里人们对里格比与郎兹提供格林威治认可的标准时间心怀感激。此种感激（休·惠特布雷德在那家商店的橱窗前闲逛时，心里就是这么想的）自然会在此后形成人们去里格比与郎兹商店买鞋袜的现象。他就是这么想的。他习惯如此。他不会深刻地思考。他只是轻触表面，废弃的语言、正在使用的语言、君士坦丁堡、巴黎、罗马的生活、骑马、射猎、网球，都是他一度所爱。心存不良的人宣称他如今在白金汉宫做守卫，身穿丝袜与及膝短裤，看守什么也无人知晓。可他极其称职。他已经在英国上层社会虚度了五十五年。他结识过一些首相。据了解，他对他们感情颇深。要是那时他真的没投身过任何重大运动，也没有担当重要职位，那有一两次的温和改革应算是他的功劳：一是改善公共避难所；一是对诺福克的猫头鹰的保护。女佣们有充分的理由感激他。他给《泰晤士报》写过一些信，请求筹款，呼吁大众维护公益，保护环境，清除垃圾，减少烟雾，禁止公园内不雅行为，那些信末尾他的署名令人敬重。","Looking up, it appeared that each letter of their names stood for one of the hours; subconsciously one was grateful to Rigby and Lowndes for giving one time ratified by Greenwich; and this gratitude (so Hugh Whitbread ruminated, dallying there in front of the shop window), naturally took the form later of buying off Rigby and Lowndes socks or shoes.So he ruminated.It was his habit.He did not go deeply.He brushed surfaces; the dead languages, the living, life in Constantinople, Paris, Rome; riding, shooting, tennis, it had been once.The malicious asserted that he now kept guard at Buckingham Palace, dressed in silk stockings and knee-breeches, over what nobody knew.But he did it extremely efficiently.He had been afloat on the cream of English society for fifty-five years.He had known Prime Ministers.His affections were understood to be deep.And if it were true that he had not taken part in any of the great movements of the time or held important office, one or two humble reforms stood to his credit; an improvement in public shelters was one; the protection of owls in Norfolk another; servant girls had reason to be grateful to him; and his name at the end of letters to the @Times@, asking for funds, appealing to the public to protect, to preserve, to clear up litter, to abate smoke, and stamp out immorality in parks, commanded respect."
"他形象尚佳，在商店橱窗前逗留了一会儿（一点半的钟声逐渐消逝），批判地、权威地注视着那些鞋袜。他无可挑剔，衣着很得体，家境富裕，似乎他居高临下俯瞰着世界。不过他认识到了拥有能力、财富、健康需要履行的责任，于是尽管在不是完全必要的时候，他也谨慎地遵守细微的礼节、老式的客套，这些使得他仪态优雅，是人们效仿的对象，使人们牢记。例如，他与相识二十年的布鲁顿女士共进午餐时，总会伸出手献上一束康乃馨，还会问候布鲁顿女士的秘书布拉什小姐在南非的那位兄弟的近况，不知什么缘故，布拉什小姐身上虽然没有一点女性的特质，却对他的话感到相当愤怒，说道：“谢谢你了，他在南非过得很好。”而那六年里，他在朴茨茅斯处境悲惨。","A magnificent figure he cut too, pausing for a moment (as the sound of the half hour died away) to look critically, magisterially, at socks and shoes; impeccable, substantial, as if he beheld the world from a certain eminence, and dressed to match; but realised the obligations which size, wealth, health, entail, and observed punctiliously even when not absolutely necessary, little courtesies, old-fashioned ceremonies which gave a quality to his manner, something to imitate, something to remember him by, for he would never lunch, for example, with Lady Bruton, whom he had known these twenty years, without bringing her in his outstretched hand a bunch of carnations and asking Miss Brush, Lady Bruton’s secretary, after her brother in South Africa, which, for some reason, Miss Brush, deficient though she was in every attribute of female charm, so much resented that she said “Thank you, he’s doing very well in South Africa,” when, for half a dozen years, he had been doing badly in Portsmouth."
"布鲁顿女士自己偏爱理查德·达洛维，他接下来就到了。实际上他们是在门前台阶上相遇的。","Lady Bruton herself preferred Richard Dalloway, who arrived at the next moment.Indeed they met on the doorstep."
"布鲁顿女士自然是偏爱理查德·达洛维。他这块材料更好。但她不愿让他们诽谤她可怜的亲爱的休。她决不会忘却他的善良——他是真正出奇善良的人——她想不起到底是在什么场合。可他真是——出奇的善良。无论如何，一个人与另一个人的差别没什么了不起。她从未看出剖析人的意义是什么，像克拉丽莎·达洛维那样——把人切割开，又缝起来。无论如何，对六十二岁的人来说，是没有意义的。她接过休递来的康乃馨，棱角分明的脸上带着冷酷的笑容。没别的人要来了，她说道。她是找借口要他们来这里的，以帮助她走出困难——","Lady Bruton preferred Richard Dalloway of course.He was made of much finer material.But she wouldn’t let them run down her poor dear Hugh.She could never forget his kindness—he had been really remarkably kind—she forgot precisely upon what occasion.But he had been—remarkably kind.Anyhow, the difference between one man and another does not amount to much.She had never seen the sense of cutting people up, as Clarissa Dalloway did—cutting them up and sticking them together again; not at any rate when one was sixty-two.She took Hugh’s carnations with her angular grim smile.There was nobody else coming, she said.She had got them there on false pretences, to help her out of a difficulty—"
"“但是我们先吃了再说。”她说道。","“But let us eat first,” she said."
"然后，穿围裙、戴白帽的侍女们安静而优雅地进进出出于旋转门。这群女仆非平日所需，却擅长帮助梅费尔区的主妇们于一点半至两点钟之间演出的神秘剧或大骗局剧。挥手之间，交通停止，取而代之的是深深的幻觉，一开始有关食物——说是不用付费；随后桌子像是主动摆好了玻璃杯、银餐具、小块衬垫、盛红果的浅碟、涂了薄薄一层褐色奶油的大比目鱼，砂锅中浮着鸡块，火焰燃得五彩缤纷，非家常炉火可比，而酒与咖啡（不用付费）在冥想的眼睛面前升起愉悦的幻象，那是温柔好奇的眼睛，那是感到生活优美悦耳、神秘莫测的眼睛。此刻，那闪亮的眼睛和善地欣赏着布鲁顿女士放在碟子边的红色康乃馨的美（布鲁顿女士的动作总是有棱有角）。休·惠特布雷德觉得自身与整个宇宙处于和谐状态，与此同时对自身的地位十分有把握，因此便放下餐叉，说道：","And so there began a soundless and exquisite passing to and fro through swing doors of aproned white-capped maids, handmaidens not of necessity, but adepts in a mystery or grand deception practised by hostesses in Mayfair from one-thirty to two, when, with a wave of the hand, the traffic ceases, and there rises instead this profound illusion in the first place about the food—how it is not paid for; and then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass and silver, little mats, saucers of red fruit; films of brown cream mask turbot; in casseroles severed chickens swim; coloured, undomestic, the fire burns; and with the wine and the coffee (not paid for) rise jocund visions before musing eyes; gently speculative eyes; eyes to whom life appears musical, mysterious; eyes now kindled to observe genially the beauty of the red carnations which Lady Bruton (whose movements were always angular) had laid beside her plate, so that Hugh Whitbread, feeling at peace with the entire universe and at the same time completely sure of his standing, said, resting his fork, "
"“那花朵要是衬着你的蕾丝不是很好看吗？”","“Wouldn’t they look charming against your lace?”"
"布拉什小姐极端痛恨这种套近乎。她觉得他是一个没教养的家伙。她的想法令布鲁顿女士发笑。","Miss Brush resented this familiarity intensely.She thought him an underbred fellow.She made Lady Bruton laugh."
"布鲁顿女士拿起康乃馨，颇为呆板地握在手里，几乎与她身后画像上握着卷轴的将军的姿势一样。她依然不动弹，神情恍惚。那么她是谁，是将军的曾孙女吗？还是玄孙女？理查德·达洛维问自己。罗德里克爵士、迈尔斯爵士、塔尔博特爵士——正是。不同寻常的是那个家族的女人继承了先辈的面容。她自己本该当龙骑士的将领。而理查德会很高兴在她麾下服役。他对她无比尊重，对那些出身名门望族、家境殷实的老妇人怀有浪漫的情愫。而且以他那愉悦的禀性，他会喜欢带几个他熟悉的鲁莽青年与她一起吃午饭，好像她这样的女士可以从和蔼可亲的、喜欢喝茶的人中培育出来一样！他了解她的家乡。他懂得她的亲人。她家乡有棵葡萄架，还结果呢，是洛夫莱斯还是赫里克——她本人从未诵读过一句诗，这个故事却留传下来——曾经坐在葡萄架下。最好还是等一会儿向他们提出那个烦扰她的问题（是有关呼吁大众的事情，假如要提的话，怎么说呢），最好还是一直等到他们喝过咖啡吧，布鲁顿女士想着。她把那束康乃馨搁在自己的碟子边。","Lady Bruton raised the carnations, holding them rather stiffly with much the same attitude with which the General held the scroll in the picture behind her; she remained fixed, tranced.Which was she now, the General’s great-grand-daughter?great-great-grand-daughter?Richard Dalloway asked himself.Sir Roderick, Sir Miles, Sir Talbot—that was it.It was remarkable how in that family the likeness persisted in the women.She should have been a general of dragoons herself.And Richard would have served under her, cheerfully; he had the greatest respect for her; he cherished these romantic views about well-set-up old women of pedigree, and would have liked, in his good-humoured way, to bring some young hot-heads of his acquaintance to lunch with her; as if a type like hers could be bred of amiable tea-drinking enthusiasts!He knew her country.He knew her people.There was a vine, still bearing, which either Lovelace or Herrick—she never read a word poetry of herself, but so the story ran—had sat under.Better wait to put before them the question that bothered her (about making an appeal to the public; if so, in what terms and so on), better wait until they have had their coffee, Lady Bruton thought; and so laid the carnations down beside her plate."
"“克拉丽莎怎么样了？”她唐突地问。","“How’s Clarissa?” she asked abruptly."
"克拉丽莎总说布鲁顿女士不喜欢她。实际上，布鲁顿女士有这样的名声：她对政治的兴趣胜过对人的兴趣。她说话像个男人。插手过八十年代某桩声名狼藉的阴谋诡计，现在这桩事在回忆录里开始被提到。可以肯定的是，在她的客厅中有个凹室，凹室里有张桌子，上面放着一张已故将军塔尔博特·穆尔爵士的照片。就在这张桌上（八十年代的一天夜里），有布鲁顿女士在场的情况下，在她知道的情况下（可能还提了点建议），那将军写下一封电报下令英国军队在某个历史时刻前进。（她保存了那支笔，并告诉人们这件事。）于是，当她唐突地问道“克拉丽莎怎么样了”时，丈夫们难以说服自己的妻子相信她会关心女士，而实际上，不管他们对她多么忠诚，私下里也在怀疑。女士们常阻碍她们的丈夫，不准他们担当国外的职位。议会开会中途她们患上流感，丈夫们只好陪她们去海边养病。然而女士们准确无误地知道她的嘘寒问暖“克拉丽莎怎么样了”来自于一个对她们有善意祝愿的人，来自于一位几乎无声的朋友。她的言语（在整个生命历程中可能只有六次）表示她认可某种女性之间姐妹似的情分，这比宴请男人参加午宴更深刻。她用一条奇特的纽带联结了布鲁顿女士与达洛维夫人，她俩难得相见，而且真的遇到时也都很漠然，甚至敌视对方。","Clarissa always said that Lady Bruton did not like her.Indeed, Lady Bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people; of talking like a man; of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties, which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs.Certainly there was an alcove in her drawing-room, and a table in that alcove, and a photograph upon that table of General Sir Talbot Moore, now deceased, who had written there (one evening in the eighties) in Lady Bruton’s presence, with her cognisance, perhaps advice, a telegram ordering the British troops to advance upon an historical occasion.(She kept the pen and told the story.) Thus, when she said in her offhand way “How’s Clarissa?” husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and indeed, however devoted, were secretly doubtful themselves, of her interest in women who often got in their husbands’ way, prevented them from accepting posts abroad, and had to be taken to the seaside in the middle of the session to recover from influenza.Nevertheless her inquiry, “How’s Clarissa?” was known by women infallibly, to be a signal from a well-wisher, from an almost silent companion, whose utterances (half a dozen perhaps in the course of a lifetime) signified recognition of some feminine comradeship which went beneath masculine lunch parties and united Lady Bruton and Mrs. Dalloway, who seldom met, and appeared when they did meet indifferent and even hostile, in a singular bond."
"“我今天早晨在公园里遇到了克拉丽莎。”休·惠特布雷德说道，一边在砂锅里猛吃，急切地用这小菜犒劳自己，因为他只要一来伦敦就立即会遇见所有人。但是他真贪吃，米利·布拉什小姐想，这是她所认识的最贪吃的人中的一个。布拉什小姐带着坚定的公正态度观察男人，能永远保持着忠诚，尤其是对与自己同性别的人。尽管她本人皮肤有疙瘩，有擦伤，瘦骨嶙峋，毫无女性的风韵。","“I met Clarissa in the Park this morning,” said Hugh Whitbread, diving into the casserole, anxious to pay himself this little tribute, for he had only to come to London and he met everybody at once; but greedy, one of the greediest men she had ever known, Milly Brush thought, who observed men with unflinching rectitude, and was capable of everlasting devotion, to her own sex in particular, being knobbed, scraped, angular, and entirely without feminine charm."
"“你知道谁到伦敦了吗？”布鲁顿女士说道，突然想起了她。“咱们的故交，彼得·沃尔什。”","“D’you know who’s in town?” said Lady Bruton suddenly bethinking her.“Our old friend, Peter Walsh.”"
"他们都笑了。是彼得·沃尔什！达洛维先生真的感到高兴，米利·布拉什想着。而惠特布雷德先生只关心自己的鸡块。","They all smiled.Peter Walsh!And Mr. Dalloway was genuinely glad, Milly Brush thought; and Mr. Whitbread thought only of his chicken."
"是彼得·沃尔什！一共三位，布鲁顿女士、休·惠特布雷德以及理查德·达洛维，都想起同样的往事——彼得是怎样热烈地恋爱、遭到拒绝、去了印度，一败涂地，生活一团糟。理查德·达洛维却还对那亲爱的老伙伴极其喜爱。米利·布拉什看出这一点。她在他褐色眼睛中看到深情，看到了他的犹豫不决、思前想后，这激发了她的兴致。其实达洛维先生一直就吸引着她，她想知道，他是怎么看待彼得·沃尔什的？在想，彼得·沃尔什曾爱过克拉丽莎，他午宴后会径直回去找克拉丽莎，他要明明白白地告诉她，他爱着她。是的，他会那样说。","Peter Walsh!All three, Lady Bruton, Hugh Whitbread, and Richard Dalloway, remembered the same thing—how passionately Peter had been in love; been rejected; gone to India; come a cropper; made a mess of things; and Richard Dalloway had a very great liking for the dear old fellow too.Milly Brush saw that; saw a depth in the brown of his eyes; saw him hesitate; consider; which interested her, as Mr. Dalloway always interested her, for what was he thinking, she wondered, about Peter Walsh?That Peter Walsh had been in love with Clarissa; that he would go back directly after lunch and find Clarissa; that he would tell her, in so many words, that he loved her.Yes, he would say that."
"米利·布拉什曾经可能差点就爱上这些沉默的时刻。而达洛维先生一贯都是那么可靠，也是一个绅士。现在，米利·布拉什四十岁了，布鲁顿女士仅需点点头，或是突然稍稍回头，米利·布拉什便能理解其用意，尽管她可能深陷冥想中。生活无法欺骗她超脱的心灵，未被腐蚀的灵魂，因为生活从没给过她任何有价值的东西，没有给她美丽的鬈发、微笑、嘴唇、脸蛋、鼻子，什么也没给。布鲁顿女士仅需点点头，布拉什就会命珀金斯迅速端上咖啡。","Milly Brush once might almost have fallen in love with these silences; and Mr. Dalloway was always so dependable; such a gentleman too.Now, being forty, Lady Bruton had only to nod, or turn her head a little abruptly, and Milly Brush took the signal, however deeply she might be sunk in these reflections of a detached spirit, of an uncorrupted soul whom life could not bamboozle, because life had not offered her a trinket of the slightest value; not a curl, smile, lip, cheek, nose; nothing whatever; Lady Bruton had only to nod, and Perkins was instructed to quicken the coffee."
"“是的，彼得·沃尔什已经回来了。”布鲁顿女士说道。他们所有人都有些许得意。他已经回来了，受尽了折磨，没有成功，回到他们的安全之岸。然而他们想，要帮他是很难的，他的天性里有某种缺陷。休·惠特布雷德说当然可以对某某人提及彼得之名。他一想起自己要写信给政府部门领导提及“我的故交，彼得·沃尔什”等等，就伤心而傲慢地皱起眉头。可是这不会有什么结果的——不会有什么长久的结果，这是彼得的性格使然。","“Yes; Peter Walsh has come back,” said Lady Bruton.It was vaguely flattering to them all.He had come back, battered, unsuccessful, to their secure shores.But to help him, they reflected, was impossible; there was some flaw in his character.Hugh Whitbread said one might of course mention his name to So-and-so.He wrinkled lugubriously, consequentially, at the thought of the letters he would write to the heads of Government offices about “my old friend, Peter Walsh,” and so on.But it wouldn’t lead to anything—not to anything permanent, because of his character."
"“与某个女人纠缠不清。”布鲁顿女士说道。大家早就猜到那就是问题的根源。","“In trouble with some woman,” said Lady Bruton.They had all guessed that THAT was at the bottom of it."
"“然而，”布鲁顿女士急欲撇开这个话题，“我们会从彼得自己那里听到整个事情的情况。”","“However,” said Lady Bruton, anxious to leave the subject, “we shall hear the whole story from Peter himself.”"
"（咖啡上得太慢了。）","(The coffee was very slow in coming.)"
"“他的地址是？”休·惠特布雷德咕哝道。这话立即在日复一日冲刷着布鲁顿女士的身穿灰色衣服仆人中间的激起一阵涟漪。他们为她收集物品、截住烦扰、把她裹入一层精密的织物中，减弱震荡，减少打扰，在布鲁克街的宅邸里铺开一张精密网。一切都安放在那里，头发灰白的珀金斯可以立即精确地取出需要的物件，他一直跟随布鲁顿女士三十年了，此刻便写下彼得的地址，把它交给惠特布雷德先生。惠特布雷德掏出笔记薄，挑着眉毛，把那地址夹在最重要的文件里。他说会叫伊夫琳去请彼得吃午餐。","“The address?” murmured Hugh Whitbread; and there was at once a ripple in the grey tide of service which washed round Lady Bruton day in, day out, collecting, intercepting, enveloping her in a fine tissue which broke concussions, mitigated interruptions, and spread round the house in Brook Street a fine net where things lodged and were picked out accurately, instantly, by grey-haired Perkins, who had been with Lady Bruton these thirty years and now wrote down the address; handed it to Mr. Whitbread, who took out his pocket-book, raised his eyebrows, and slipping it in among documents of the highest importance, said that he would get Evelyn to ask him to lunch."
"（侍从们一直在等惠特布雷德先生吃完以便端咖啡来。）","(They were waiting to bring the coffee until Mr. Whitbread had finished.)"
"休的动作太慢了，布鲁顿女士想。他变胖了，她留意到。理查德一直保持着非常健康的身体。她渐渐急躁起来。她整个身心都在坚定地、不可否认地、盛气凌人地推掉这一切多余的琐屑之事（彼得·沃尔什以及他的绯闻），而关注那个引起她注意的那件事。那件事不仅引起了她的注意，还吸引了她灵魂之源的本质的东西，那是她身上最本质的部分。没有这个，米莉森特·布鲁顿就不再是米莉森特·布鲁顿了。那件事就是让出身高贵的年轻男女移居到加拿大，并帮助他们建立良好的发展前途。她夸大其词了。她可能丧失了平衡感。移居对其他人来讲不是显而易见的良方，不是崇高的设想。对他们来讲不是（包括休、理查德、甚至忠诚的布拉什小姐）积郁的自我主义的解放。布鲁顿女士强健英武、教育良好、出身世家、率直冲动、感情直露而没有自省能力（她坦荡而单纯——为何无法使人人都坦荡而单纯呢？她问道）。她这样的女人一旦青春消逝，便觉得自我中心主义在内心高涨，一定得朝着某个目标透射——可能是移民、可能是解放。无论是什么，她的灵魂天天围着这个目标分泌出精华，必然变得五光十色、光彩夺目，一半似镜，一半似宝石；有时小心地藏起来免得人们取笑，有时又傲慢地展示出来。简而言之，移民这个想法已经成为布鲁顿女士的一大部分。","Hugh was very slow, Lady Bruton thought.He was getting fat, she noticed.Richard always kept himself in the pink of condition.She was getting impatient; the whole of her being was setting positively, undeniably, domineeringly brushing aside all this unnecessary trifling (Peter Walsh and his affairs) upon that subject which engaged her attention, and not merely her attention, but that fibre which was the ramrod of her soul, that essential part of her without which Millicent Bruton would not have been Millicent Bruton; that project for emigrating young people of both sexes born of respectable parents and setting them up with a fair prospect of doing well in Canada.She exaggerated.She had perhaps lost her sense of proportion.Emigration was not to others the obvious remedy, the sublime conception.It was not to them (not to Hugh, or Richard, or even to devoted Miss Brush) the liberator of the pent egotism, which a strong martial woman, well nourished, well descended, of direct impulses, downright feelings, and little introspective power (broad and simple—why could not every one be broad and simple?she asked) feels rise within her, once youth is past, and must eject upon some object—it may be Emigration, it may be Emancipation; but whatever it be, this object round which the essence of her soul is daily secreted, becomes inevitably prismatic, lustrous, half looking-glass, half precious stone; now carefully hidden in case people should sneer at it; now proudly displayed.Emigration had become, in short, largely Lady Bruton."
"不过她必须要写信。她过去经常给布拉什小姐讲，写一封信给《泰晤士报》花的心血大于组建一支南非远征军（她在战争中干过这事）。她战斗了一个早上，写了开头，然后撕掉，又重新写。她常感到自己作为一名女性的无用，这是她在其他无论什么场合都没有感觉到的。于是她会心怀感激之情地想起休·惠特布雷德——没人会质疑——他具备写信给《泰晤士报》的才艺。","But she had to write.And one letter to the @Times@, she used to say to Miss Brush, cost her more than to organise an expedition to South Africa (which she had done in the war).After a morning’s battle beginning, tearing up, beginning again, she used to feel the futility of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion, and would turn gratefully to the thought of Hugh Whitbread who possessed—no one could doubt it—the art of writing letters to the @Times@."
"这人和她本人的资质极其不同，拥有如此高超的语言驾驭能力，信写得能和编辑们喜好的一样，他的种种激情不能简简单单地称之为贪婪。布鲁顿女士遵从男人（而非女人）和宇宙之间的神秘的和谐关系，因此经常不急于对男人做出判断。男人懂得怎样用词，懂得别人说的什么。所以要是理查德当她的顾问，休当她的笔杆子，她便确信怎么都有些道理。所以她任休吃完蛋奶酥，向可怜的伊夫琳问好，一直等到他们抽烟了，才说道：","A being so differently constituted from herself, with such a command of language; able to put things as editors like them put; had passions which one could not call simply greed.Lady Bruton often suspended judgement upon men in deference to the mysterious accord in which they, but no woman, stood to the laws of the universe; knew how to put things; knew what was said; so that if Richard advised her, and Hugh wrote for her, she was sure of being somehow right.So she let Hugh eat his souffle; asked after poor Evelyn; waited until they were smoking, and then said,"
"“米利，去拿下信纸好吗？”","“Milly, would you fetch the papers?”"
"随后布拉什小姐出去了，又回来了，把信纸放在桌上。休掏出他的钢笔，他那银色的钢笔，已经用了二十年了。他说道，同时拧开笔帽。这支笔仍毫发未损，他曾给制造商检查过。他们说这支笔是没有理由用坏的。这怎么也得归功于休，也归功于他这笔表达出的情感（理查德·达洛维如是想）。休开始认真地写下花体大写字母，即字母之间的空白处带圈。他就如此奇迹般地将布鲁顿女士盘根错节的思绪处理成意思清晰、语法恰当的文字。布鲁顿女士注视着这奇迹的改变，觉得甚至是《泰晤士报》的编辑对此也必然会敬佩的。休进展缓慢。休固执己见。理查德说必须要冒些风险。休提议鉴于人们的感情应写得温和点。理查德笑话他时，他语出非常锋利，人们的感情“一定得考虑”，还念道：“所以，我们认为时机已经成熟……我国不断增长的人口中那些过剩的年轻人……这就是我辈对死者应尽的义务……”理查德觉得这尽是空话废话，当然，把这些写在信里也没什么害处。于是休继续草拟信件，按照字母顺序把最崇高的思想一一列出，一边掸去马甲上的雪茄灰烬。时而总结一下进度，直到最终完成此稿，他读了一番，布鲁顿女士确信这是篇佳作。那是她要表达的意思吗？","And Miss Brush went out, came back; laid papers on the table; and Hugh produced his fountain pen; his silver fountain pen, which had done twenty years’ service, he said, unscrewing the cap.It was still in perfect order; he had shown it to the makers; there was no reason, they said, why it should ever wear out; which was somehow to Hugh’s credit, and to the credit of the sentiments which his pen expressed (so Richard Dalloway felt) as Hugh began carefully writing capital letters with rings round them in the margin, and thus marvellously reduced Lady Bruton’s tangles to sense, to grammar such as the editor of the Times, Lady Bruton felt, watching the marvellous transformation, must respect.Hugh was slow.Hugh was pertinacious.Richard said one must take risks.Hugh proposed modifications in deference to people’s feelings, which, he said rather tartly when Richard laughed, “had to be considered,” and read out “how, therefore, we are of opinion that the times are ripe... the superfluous youth of our ever-increasing population... what we owe to the dead...” which Richard thought all stuffing and bunkum, but no harm in it, of course, and Hugh went on drafting sentiments in alphabetical order of the highest nobility, brushing the cigar ash from his waistcoat, and summing up now and then the progress they had made until, finally, he read out the draft of a letter which Lady Bruton felt certain was a masterpiece.Could her own meaning sound like that?"
"休无法保证编辑一定会刊登这封信，不过他会在午宴上会见见某人。","Hugh could not guarantee that the editor would put it in; but he would be meeting somebody at luncheon."
"于是，很少做出优雅举止的布鲁顿女士将休送她的康乃馨全都塞到她的裙胸前，然后伸出双手，称他为“我的首相”！要是没有他们两个，她还不知要怎么做呢。他俩站了起来。理查德·达洛维和往常一样悠闲地走出去瞥了一下将军的肖像，因为他打算一闲下来，就撰写一部布鲁顿女士的家族史。","Whereupon Lady Bruton, who seldom did a graceful thing, stuffed all Hugh’s carnations into the front of her dress, and flinging her hands out called him “My Prime Minister!”What she would have done without them both she did not know.They rose.And Richard Dalloway strolled off as usual to have a look at the General’s portrait, because he meant, whenever he had a moment of leisure, to write a history of Lady Bruton’s family."
"米莉森特·布鲁顿则很为其家世感到骄傲。她边看照片边说，不过他们能暂缓一下，他们能暂缓一下。她的意思是能暂缓撰写她家祖祖辈辈，那些武将，文官，海军将领，都是实干家，都已尽职尽责。而理查德首先得为自己的国家尽责，但那是一副精致的面孔，她说。一切档案都在奥尔德密克斯顿准备好了，只要时机一到，理查德就可以使用。她的意思是工党政府倒台以后。“啊，印度传来的消息！”她大声说道。","And Millicent Bruton was very proud of her family.But they could wait, they could wait, she said, looking at the picture; meaning that her family, of military men, administrators, admirals, had been men of action, who had done their duty; and Richard’s first duty was to his country, but it was a fine face, she said; and all the papers were ready for Richard down at Aldmixton whenever the time came; the Labour Government she meant.“Ah, the news from India!” she cried."
"然后，当他们站在门厅里，从放在孔雀石桌上的一个钵里拿出黄手套的时候，休带着很不必要的谦恭赠予布拉什小姐某张没人要的什么票或是别的此类的小殷勤。布拉什小姐打心眼里厌恶这些，她的脸刷地变成了砖红色。理查德手里拿着帽子，转身向布鲁顿女士说道：","And then, as they stood in the hall taking yellow gloves from the bowl on the malachite table and Hugh was offering Miss Brush with quite unnecessary courtesy some discarded ticket or other compliment, which she loathed from the depths of her heart and blushed brick red, Richard turned to Lady Bruton, with his hat in his hand, and said,"
"“今晚我们能在晚宴上见到您吗？”听罢，布鲁顿女士重新表现出被写信破坏掉的尊贵仪态。她或许会来，或许不会来。克拉丽莎有旺盛的活力。布鲁顿女士对聚会感到害怕。但另一方面，她渐渐变老了。她就这样暗示着，站在门口，端庄优雅、身板笔挺。而她那只中国狗在她身后伸展四肢躺着，布拉什小姐手里满是纸张，退到不显眼的位置。","“We shall see you at our party tonight?” whereupon Lady Bruton resumed the magnificence which letter-writing had shattered.She might come; or she might not come.Clarissa had wonderful energy.Parties terrified Lady Bruton.But then, she was getting old.So she intimated, standing at her doorway; handsome; very erect; while her chow stretched behind her, and Miss Brush disappeared into the background with her hands full of papers."
"布鲁顿女士拖着沉重的步子，庄严地走到她的房间里，在沙发上躺着，一只手臂伸直着。她叹气、打鼾，并非是睡着了，仅是昏昏欲睡的、昏昏欲睡的，宛如在这火热的六月天里烈日炙烤下的一片三叶草地，蜜蜂和黄色的蝴蝶在周围飞旋个不停。她总是想起沿着德文郡的那些原野。在那里她曾骑上她的小马驹帕蒂，与她的兄弟莫蒂默和汤姆一起越过溪涧。那里有狗、老鼠，还有她的双亲在草地上树阴下乘凉，一旁放着茶具，花坛里栽着大丽花、蜀葵、蒲苇，而他们——这群小淘气——老是捣蛋！穿过灌木林悄悄溜回来，以免被发现，由于淘气全身都脏兮兮的。老保姆过去责怪她弄脏衣服！","And Lady Bruton went ponderously, majestically, up to her room, lay, one arm extended, on the sofa.She sighed, she snored, not that she was asleep, only drowsy and heavy, drowsy and heavy, like a field of clover in the sunshine this hot June day, with the bees going round and about and the yellow butterflies.Always she went back to those fields down in Devonshire, where she had jumped the brooks on Patty, her pony, with Mortimer and Tom, her brothers.And there were the dogs; there were the rats; there were her father and mother on the lawn under the trees, with the tea-things out, and the beds of dahlias, the hollyhocks, the pampas grass; and they, little wretches, always up to some mischief!stealing back through the shrubbery, so as not to be seen, all bedraggled from some roguery.What old nurse used to say about her frocks!"
"啊，哎呀，她记得了——那是周三，在布鲁克街上。那俩善良的好伙伴，理查德·达洛维和休·惠特布雷德在这个大热天已经穿过街道离开了，街上的嘈杂声直钻到在沙发上躺着的她的耳朵里。她拥有权力、地位、金钱。她曾生活在她那个时代的最前沿。她有过一些好友，结交过当时最有才能的人。伦敦的喃喃声涌到她耳边，那只放在沙发背上的手握着某根假想的权杖，就像她祖辈们可能握过的权杖。她昏昏欲睡地握着这根权杖，仿佛指挥着军队朝加拿大行进。那俩好伙伴则正穿过伦敦，穿过他们的地盘，那块小小的地毯般的地方——梅弗尔区。","Ah dear, she remembered—it was Wednesday in Brook Street.Those kind good fellows, Richard Dalloway, Hugh Whitbread, had gone this hot day through the streets whose growl came up to her lying on the sofa.Power was hers, position, income.She had lived in the forefront of her time.She had had good friends; known the ablest men of her day.Murmuring London flowed up to her, and her hand, lying on the sofa back, curled upon some imaginary baton such as her grandfathers might have held, holding which she seemed, drowsy and heavy, to be commanding battalions marching to Canada, and those good fellows walking across London, that territory of theirs, that little bit of carpet, Mayfair."
"他俩离她愈来愈远了，通过一根纤细的线与她相连（因为他俩与她共进过午餐）。他俩走过伦敦时，这线将变得越来越长、越来越细，仿佛与朋友们共进午餐之后，就会有一根纤细的线联结你的朋友和你自身。这根线（在她打盹的时候）随着报时的钟声或是召集人们到教堂做礼拜的钟声变得模糊起来，有如雨滴落在一张蜘蛛网上，在重压下凹陷了下去。于是她睡着了。","And they went further and further from her, being attached to her by a thin thread (since they had lunched with her) which would stretch and stretch, get thinner and thinner as they walked across London; as if one’s friends were attached to one’s body, after lunching with them, by a thin thread, which (as she dozed there) became hazy with the sound of bells, striking the hour or ringing to service, as a single spider’s thread is blotted with rain-drops, and, burdened, sags down.So she slept."
"正当米莉森特·布鲁顿躺在沙发上，打起了呼噜，任由这根线绷断时，理查德·达洛维和休·惠特布雷德在康迪街的拐角上踌躇着。两股互逆的风在街的拐角冲撞。他俩瞧着一家店的橱窗，两人不想买什么，也不想聊天，只想要分别。但仅仅是由于街的拐角冲撞着两股互逆的风，及早晨和下午两股力量碰撞成一个漩涡，使得体内的潮水有些退却，他们停了下来。有家报纸的布告栏飞到了天上，最初像一只风筝，勇敢地飞着，随之停了下来，晃晃悠悠地飞扑下来。一条女士的面纱在那里挂着。黄色的雨棚在颤抖。早上的交通车辆的速度变慢了，只有几辆运货马车在半是空荡荡的街上咔嗒咔嗒地、漫不经心地开过。理查德·达洛维半心半意地想起了诺福克郡，一阵柔和的暖风吹得花瓣都合上了，吹得水波荡漾，吹得繁花遍地的草坪起起伏伏。晒干草的人结束了早晨的劳作后，在树篱下躺着休憩，他们拨开绿绿的草叶和一坨坨颤抖的欧芹眺望苍穹，那碧蓝的、亘古不变的、耀眼的夏日天空。","And Richard Dalloway and Hugh Whitbread hesitated at the corner of Conduit Street at the very moment that Millicent Bruton, lying on the sofa, let the thread snap; snored.Contrary winds buffeted at the street corner.They looked in at a shop window; they did not wish to buy or to talk but to part, only with contrary winds buffeting the street corner, with some sort of lapse in the tides of the body, two forces meeting in a swirl, morning and afternoon, they paused.Some newspaper placard went up in the air, gallantly, like a kite at first, then paused, swooped, fluttered; and a lady’s veil hung.Yellow awnings trembled.The speed of the morning traffic slackened, and single carts rattled carelessly down half-empty streets.In Norfolk, of which Richard Dalloway was half thinking, a soft warm wind blew back the petals; confused the waters; ruffled the flowering grasses.Haymakers, who had pitched beneath hedges to sleep away the morning toil, parted curtains of green blades; moved trembling globes of cow parsley to see the sky; the blue, the steadfast, the blazing summer sky."
"理查德意识到自己正注视着一个有两个把手的詹姆士一世时代的银杯，休·惠特布雷德则一副鉴赏家的派头高傲地欣赏着一串西班牙项链，他考虑着去询问价格，说不定伊夫琳会喜欢——理查德始终懒洋洋的，无法动脑筋，也无法动弹。生活制造了这些残骸。商店橱窗中摆满了五彩的人造宝石，人们站在窗前往里瞅，如没精打采的老者一样拘谨，如刻板的老者一样僵硬。伊夫琳·惠特布雷德也许想要买下这串西班牙项链——她也许会买。他必须要打个呵欠了。休正朝店里走去。","Aware that he was looking at a silver two-handled Jacobean mug, and that Hugh Whitbread admired condescendingly with airs of connoisseurship a Spanish necklace which he thought of asking the price of in case Evelyn might like it—still Richard was torpid; could not think or move.Life had thrown up this wreckage; shop windows full of coloured paste, and one stood stark with the lethargy of the old, stiff with the rigidity of the old, looking in.Evelyn Whitbread might like to buy this Spanish necklace—so she might.Yawn he must.Hugh was going into the shop."
"“你是对的！”理查德说着，接着就跟进去了。","“Right you are!” said Richard, following."
"天知道他不愿有休陪着去买项链。不过身体里的潮水在涌动。早上和下午汇在一起。如一条弱不禁风的小船在深深的、深深的洪水中沉沉浮浮。布鲁顿女士的曾祖父及他的回忆录，他那些北美的战斗都被洪水淹没、下沉了。而米利森特·布鲁顿也是如此。她下沉了。理查德毫不在乎有关移民的事，也毫不在乎那封信是否会被编辑刊登。那项链舒展开，挂在休漂亮的手指间。要是他一定要买些珠宝，就叫他把珠宝赠与一个女孩——无论哪位女孩，就算是街头女孩。因为理查德的确很强烈地感受到这生活无聊透顶——为伊夫琳买项链。要是他有了一个儿子，他会对儿子讲，工作、工作。然而他有他的伊丽莎白，他很喜欢他的伊丽莎白。","Goodness knows he didn’t want to go buying necklaces with Hugh.But there are tides in the body.Morning meets afternoon.Borne like a frail shallop on deep, deep floods, Lady Bruton’s great-grandfather and his memoir and his campaigns in North America were whelmed and sunk.And Millicent Bruton too.She went under.Richard didn’t care a straw what became of Emigration; about that letter, whether the editor put it in or not.The necklace hung stretched between Hugh’s admirable fingers.Let him give it to a girl, if he must buy jewels—any girl, any girl in the street.For the worthlessness of this life did strike Richard pretty forcibly—buying necklaces for Evelyn.If he’d had a boy he’d have said, Work, work.But he had his Elizabeth; he adored his Elizabeth."
"“我该会见一下迪博内先生。”休用他那事故的口气简要地说道。仿佛这个迪博内测过惠特布雷德夫人脖子的尺寸大小，或者，还有更古怪的，他了解她对西班牙珠宝的看法及她持有诸如此类珠宝的程度（休对此记不清楚）。　所有这些情况对理查德·达洛维来说是非常奇怪的。因为他从未送过礼物给克拉丽莎，除了两三年前送的一只手镯，并没有成效。她从未戴过那只手镯。想到她从不戴那玩意儿儿，他就痛苦。宛如一张蜘蛛网左右摇晃之后粘住一片叶尖，理查德的心灵从昏沉中苏醒，现在专注在他的妻子克拉丽莎身上。彼得·沃尔什曾经那么强烈地爱过她。理查德眼前突然间出现她吃午饭时的景象，他本人和克拉丽莎，他俩一起生活的景象。他将一碟古老的珠宝拿到他跟前，先捡一枚胸针又挑一枚戒指。“那个多少钱？”他问道，不过对自己的品味感到怀疑。他想打开客厅门进去的时候在手上拿点什么，一份送给克拉丽莎的礼物。只是买什么呢？然而休又要走动了。他高傲得难以形容。真是的，和这家商店来往三十五年了，他才不会被一个对生意一无所知的毛头小子打发呢。因为迪博内好像出去了，迪博内先生不回来，休是不会买任何东西的。那小伙计见此情形脸刷地红了，规规矩矩地向他微微鞠了一躬。全都十分妥帖。可是就算为了活命理查德也不可能说那些话！他不能理解为何这些店员要容忍那种可恶的傲慢。休正成为一个使人不能容忍的傻瓜。理查德·达洛维陪他超过一小时，就再也经受不住了。理查德在康迪特街拐角处拐弯，轻掸他的圆顶硬礼帽算是告别，他很渴望，是的，相当渴望沿着那张连结他自己和克拉丽莎的那根蜘蛛丝走去，他会径直向她走去，到威斯敏斯特去。","“I should like to see Mr. Dubonnet,” said Hugh in his curt worldly way.It appeared that this Dubonnet had the measurements of Mrs. Whitbread’s neck, or, more strangely still, knew her views upon Spanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line (which Hugh could not remember).All of which seemed to Richard Dalloway awfully odd.For he never gave Clarissa presents, except a bracelet two or three years ago, which had not been a success.She never wore it.It pained him to remember that she never wore it.And as a single spider’s thread after wavering here and there attaches itself to the point of a leaf, so Richard’s mind, recovering from its lethargy, set now on his wife, Clarissa, whom Peter Walsh had loved so passionately; and Richard had had a sudden vision of her there at luncheon; of himself and Clarissa; of their life together; and he drew the tray of old jewels towards him, and taking up first this brooch then that ring, “How much is that?” he asked, but doubted his own taste.He wanted to open the drawing-room door and come in holding out something; a present for Clarissa.Only what?But Hugh was on his legs again.He was unspeakably pompous.Really, after dealing here for thirty-five years he was not going to be put off by a mere boy who did not know his business.For Dubonnet, it seemed, was out, and Hugh would not buy anything until Mr. Dubonnet chose to be in; at which the youth flushed and bowed his correct little bow.It was all perfectly correct.And yet Richard couldn’t have said that to save his life!Why these people stood that damned insolence he could not conceive.Hugh was becoming an intolerable ass.Richard Dalloway could not stand more than an hour of his society.And, flicking his bowler hat by way of farewell, Richard turned at the corner of Conduit Street eager, yes, very eager, to travel that spider’s thread of attachment between himself and Clarissa; he would go straight to her, in Westminster."
"不过他想在进家门时手里拿点什么。花怎么样？是的，拿花，既然他不信任自己对金银饰品的品味。无论多少花，玫瑰、兰花，都行，为了庆贺一桩无论你怎么想都很重要的事。就是他俩在午宴上说到彼得·沃尔什时，他对她产生的情愫。他俩从未谈到过这种情愫，多少年来从未说起过。他手里握着红白玫瑰（用棉纸包装的一大束花），想道，这是世上最大的错误。　后来成了有机会的时候也说不出口。他想，太羞于说出口了，一边将一两个六便士硬币装入口袋，在胸口擎着那一大束花要动身去威斯敏斯特。他要献上他的花，直接明了地说（不管她会怎么看他）：“我爱你。”为何不这样做？一想起战争，他就觉得确是一件不可思议的事情，千万个不幸的小伙子，他们有多好的前途啊，却被埋在一起，半数已经被忘却。这确是一件不可思议的事情。而他正走过伦敦要直截了当地对克拉丽莎说他是爱她的。他从来没说过这样的话，他想。有几分是因为懒散，有几分是因为腼腆。那克拉丽莎呢——难以想象她。除了刚开始阶段，就像午餐时分，他十分清楚地瞧见她了，瞧见了他俩的整个生活。他在十字路口停了下来，重复道——由于他本性单纯，尚未堕落，由于他行过军，开过枪，他执拗顽强，曾捍卫被压制的人，并在下议院里依本性做事。他保持了自己的单纯天性同时却变得甚为冷言少语，甚为拘谨——他反复说他娶了克拉丽莎是个奇迹，一个奇迹——他的生活从来就是一个奇迹，他心想，犹豫着是否要过街。可他一瞧见几个五六岁的小毛孩独自穿越皮卡迪利大街时便恼怒起来。警察应立即禁止车辆通行。他对伦敦警察不存丝毫幻想。其实，他在搜集他们玩忽职守的证据。他们不准那些小贩的手推车在街上停留，还有妓女，老天呀，她们没有过错，年轻嫖客也没有错，错在我们令人憎恶的社会制度等等。他思索着这一切，可以看出他在思索。他发丝灰白、执拗顽固、衣冠楚楚、干净整洁。他要走过公园，对他的妻子说他爱她。","But he wanted to come in holding something.Flowers?Yes, flowers, since he did not trust his taste in gold; any number of flowers, roses, orchids, to celebrate what was, reckoning things as you will, an event; this feeling about her when they spoke of Peter Walsh at luncheon; and they never spoke of it; not for years had they spoken of it; which, he thought, grasping his red and white roses together (a vast bunch in tissue paper), is the greatest mistake in the world.The time comes when it can’t be said; one’s too shy to say it, he thought, pocketing his sixpence or two of change, setting off with his great bunch held against his body to Westminster to say straight out in so many words (whatever she might think of him), holding out his flowers, “I love you.”Why not?Really it was a miracle thinking of the war, and thousands of poor chaps, with all their lives before them, shovelled together, already half forgotten; it was a miracle.Here he was walking across London to say to Clarissa in so many words that he loved her.Which one never does say, he thought.Partly one’s lazy; partly one’s shy.And Clarissa—it was difficult to think of her; except in starts, as at luncheon, when he saw her quite distinctly; their whole life.He stopped at the crossing; and repeated—being simple by nature, and undebauched, because he had tramped, and shot; being pertinacious and dogged, having championed the down-trodden and followed his instincts in the House of Commons; being preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather speechless, rather stiff—he repeated that it was a miracle that he should have married Clarissa; a miracle—his life had been a miracle, he thought; hesitating to cross.But it did make his blood boil to see little creatures of five or six crossing Piccadilly alone.The police ought to have stopped the traffic at once.He had no illusions about the London police.Indeed, he was collecting evidence of their malpractices; and those costermongers, not allowed to stand their barrows in the streets; and prostitutes, good Lord, the fault wasn’t in them, nor in young men either, but in our detestable social system and so forth; all of which he considered, could be seen considering, grey, dogged, dapper, clean, as he walked across the Park to tell his wife that he loved her."
"在他进屋的时候，他会明确地说出这句话。因为他想要是从不表达自身情感真是太可惜了，一边穿过了格林公园，愉快地看到一些贫困的家庭全家人一起在树阴下，有的躺着，有的坐着，小孩们翘着腿，吸吮牛奶。遍地都是扔了的纸袋，要是有人抗议，只要那些穿制服的胖先生中的一个就能轻而易举地捡干净。依他的观点，夏天的几个月中，每个公园、每个广场都该开放给孩子们（公园的草坪在天光下忽明忽暗，映衬着威斯敏斯特区贫穷的母亲们和她们爬着的婴儿，似乎底下有一盏黄灯移来移去）。但他不知道自己能为流浪的女人们做点什么。好比那个撑起手肘躺着的可怜女人（仿佛她蓦地扑到地上，脱离了所有羁绊，以便好奇地观察，无畏地揣测，思量种种原因、理由，她粗鲁、冒失、诙谐）。理查德·达洛维握着花就像握着武器似的靠近那女人。他目不转睛地走过她身旁。他们之间仍有燃起一星火花的一瞬——她一见他就笑了，他也善意地笑着，思考着流浪女人的问题。他俩是决不会说话的。不过他会对克拉丽莎说他爱她，直截了当地说。他很久以前对彼得·沃尔什是妒忌的，妒忌他与克拉丽莎。可她曾经时常对他说她没与彼得·沃尔什结婚是正确的。他理解克拉丽莎，因此她的话明显是真实的，她需要支持。不是由于她软弱，但是她需要支持。","For he would say it in so many words, when he came into the room.Because it is a thousand pities never to say what one feels, he thought, crossing the Green Park and observing with pleasure how in the shade of the trees whole families, poor families, were sprawling; children kicking up their legs; sucking milk; paper bags thrown about, which could easily be picked up (if people objected) by one of those fat gentlemen in livery; for he was of opinion that every park, and every square, during the summer months should be open to children (the grass of the park flushed and faded, lighting up the poor mothers of Westminster and their crawling babies, as if a yellow lamp were moved beneath).But what could be done for female vagrants like that poor creature, stretched on her elbow (as if she had flung herself on the earth, rid of all ties, to observe curiously, to speculate boldly, to consider the whys and the wherefores, impudent, loose-lipped, humorous), he did not know.Bearing his flowers like a weapon, Richard Dalloway approached her; intent he passed her; still there was time for a spark between them—she laughed at the sight of him, he smiled good-humouredly, considering the problem of the female vagrant; not that they would ever speak.But he would tell Clarissa that he loved her, in so many words.He had, once upon a time, been jealous of Peter Walsh; jealous of him and Clarissa.But she had often said to him that she had been right not to marry Peter Walsh; which, knowing Clarissa, was obviously true; she wanted support.Not that she was weak; but she wanted support."
"说到白金汉宫（宛如一位老年歌剧女主角身着一袭白衣直面观众），你不得不承认它有一种尊贵的气魄，他这样想，也不能轻视它，因为毕竟它对成千上百万人（一小撮群众正在门外守候着要看陛下坐车出宫）是一个象征，虽然它很荒谬。一个小孩用一盒积木可能会搭得更好看，他这样想道。他注视着维多利亚女王纪念碑（他能想起女王戴上她角质镜框的眼镜坐车驶过肯辛顿的场面），注视着那白色的宝球和慈母般富态的身体。不过他乐于被霍萨的后裔统治，他喜欢连续性，还喜欢对昔日传统的传承之感。他生活的时代是一个伟大的时代。的确，他本人的生活也是一个奇迹。他得清楚这一点。这就是他，正年富力强，正朝他威斯敏斯特的家走去，要跟克拉丽莎说他爱她。他认为幸福即是如此。","As for Buckingham Palace (like an old prima donna facing the audience all in white) you can’t deny it a certain dignity, he considered, nor despise what does, after all, stand to millions of people (a little crowd was waiting at the gate to see the King drive out) for a symbol, absurd though it is; a child with a box of bricks could have done better, he thought; looking at the memorial to Queen Victoria (whom he could remember in her horn spectacles driving through Kensington), its white mound, its billowing motherliness; but he liked being ruled by the descendant of Horsa; he liked continuity; and the sense of handing on the traditions of the past.It was a great age in which to have lived.Indeed, his own life was a miracle; let him make no mistake about it; here he was, in the prime of life, walking to his house in Westminster to tell Clarissa that he loved her.Happiness is this he thought."
"即是如此，他说着，进了教务长的庭院。大本钟开始敲响了，起初是预报，乐音悠扬，接着是报时，不可撤销。午餐会消磨了一整个下午，他想着，要到家门了。","It is this, he said, as he entered Dean’s Yard.Big Ben was beginning to strike, first the warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable.Lunch parties waste the entire afternoon, he thought, approaching his door."
"大本钟的钟声响遍了克拉丽莎的客厅，她坐在写字台旁恼怒不堪，焦虑啊、烦恼啊。她的的确确没请埃莉·亨德森赴宴，但她是有意这样做的。现在马香夫人却写信说：“她已告知埃莉·亨德森，她想请求克拉丽莎——埃莉很想来参加。”","The sound of Big Ben flooded Clarissa’s drawing-room, where she sat, ever so annoyed, at her writing-table; worried; annoyed.It was perfectly true that she had not asked Ellie Henderson to her party; but she had done it on purpose.Now Mrs. Marsham wrote “she had told Ellie Henderson she would ask Clarissa—Ellie so much wanted to come.”"
"但为何要她邀请伦敦所有无趣的女士都来赴宴啊？","But why should she invite all the dull women in London to her parties?"
"为何马香夫人要来干预？另外，伊丽莎白与多丽丝·基尔曼呆在房间里这么长时间了。她想象不出比这件事更令人作呕的事情了。在这个时刻与那女人一同祈祷！大本钟忧郁的声波涌入房间，消退了，又汇合在一起再次来临。此时，她精神恍惚地听见什么东西摸索、刮擦门的声音。有谁在这时候来呢？三点钟了，上帝啊！已经三点啦！因为大本钟用压倒一切的直接和庄严敲响了三次。她没听到其他什么，不过门把手被拧动后，理查德进来了！真令人意外！进来的是理查德，捧着鲜花。有一次在君士坦丁堡，她曾辜负过他。据说布鲁顿女士的午宴非常有意思，但是没邀请她。他献出花——是玫瑰，红的、白的。（可他自己不能鼓足勇气说出他爱她，不能直截了当地说。）","Why should Mrs. Marsham interfere?And there was Elizabeth closeted all this time with Doris Kilman.Anything more nauseating she could not conceive.Prayer at this hour with that woman.And the sound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave; which receded, and gathered itself together to fall once more, when she heard, distractingly, something fumbling, something scratching at the door.Who at this hour?Three, good Heavens!Three already!For with overpowering directness and dignity the clock struck three; and she heard nothing else; but the door handle slipped round and in came Richard!What a surprise!In came Richard, holding out flowers.She had failed him, once at Constantinople; and Lady Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her.He was holding out flowers—roses, red and white roses.(But he could not bring himself to say he loved her; not in so many words.)"
"多可爱啊，她边说边接过花。她懂，用不着他讲她也懂，那是他的克拉丽莎嘛。她把花插在壁炉架上的花瓶中。它们看来多可爱啊！她说道。午餐有趣吗？她问。布鲁顿女士向她问好了吗？彼得·沃尔什回国了。马香夫人写信来了。她一定要邀请埃莉·亨德森吗？那个基尔曼女人在楼上。","But how lovely, she said, taking his flowers.She understood; she understood without his speaking; his Clarissa.She put them in vases on the mantelpiece.How lovely they looked! she said.And was it amusing, she asked?Had Lady Bruton asked after her?Peter Walsh was back.Mrs. Marsham had written.Must she ask Ellie Henderson?That woman Kilman was upstairs."
"“我们坐上五分钟吧。”理查德说道。","“But let us sit down for five minutes,” said Richard."
"房间里看起来空荡荡的。所有椅子都靠在墙边。他们在做什么啊？哦，是准备举办宴会。没错，他没忘有宴会。彼得·沃尔什回国了。哦，是的。她已经见到他了。他想要离婚，他在国外爱上某个女人了。他丝毫没改变。她在那里，补着她的礼服。","It all looked so empty.All the chairs were against the wall.What had they been doing?Oh, it was for the party; no, he had not forgotten, the party.Peter Walsh was back.Oh yes; she had had him.And he was going to get a divorce; and he was in love with some woman out there.And he hadn’t changed in the slightest.There she was, mending her dress...."
"“想起伯顿了。”她说道。","“Thinking of Bourton,” she said."
"“休来午餐会了。”理查德说道。她也看到他了！哎，他变得完全不能容忍。还为伊夫琳买项链，胖得不行，一头难以容忍的笨驴。","“Hugh was at lunch,” said Richard.She had met him too!Well, he was getting absolutely intolerable.Buying Evelyn necklaces; fatter than ever; an intolerable ass."
"“我忽然想说‘原本我也许要嫁给你的’。”她说道，想起彼得戴着小蝴蝶领结坐在那里的样子，手里拿着那把折刀，一会儿打开，一会儿合上。“他总是那样，你知道的。”","“And it came over me ‘I might have married you,’” she said, thinking of Peter sitting there in his little bow-tie; with that knife, opening it, shutting it.“Just as he always was, you know.”"
"他们在吃午饭时说起他了，理查德说道。（但是他鼓不起勇气告诉她他爱她。他握住她的手。幸福即是如此，他想。）他们为米利森特·布鲁顿写了一封信给《泰晤士报》。休只会做这个。","They were talking about him at lunch, said Richard.(But he could not tell her he loved her.He held her hand.Happiness is this, he thought.) They had been writing a letter to the Times for Millicent Bruton.That was about all Hugh was fit for."
"“那亲爱的基尔曼小姐呢？”他问道。克拉丽莎认为玫瑰太可爱了。一开始簇拥着，现在各自分开了。","“And our dear Miss Kilman?” he asked.Clarissa thought the roses absolutely lovely; first bunched together; now of their own accord starting apart."
"“基尔曼回来时我们恰好吃完午餐。”她说。“伊丽莎白一见她就脸红。她俩把自己关起来。我猜她俩是在祈祷。”","“Kilman arrives just as we’ve done lunch,” she said.“Elizabeth turns pink.They shut themselves up.I suppose they’re praying.”"
"天哪！他不喜欢这样。不过这些事顺其自然的话是会过去的。","Lord!He didn’t like it; but these things pass over if you let them."
"“她身穿雨衣还打着伞。”克拉丽莎说道。","“In a mackintosh with an umbrella,” said Clarissa."
"他说不出“我爱你”，不过他握住了她的手。幸福即是如此，即是如此，他心想。","He had not said “I love you”; but he held her hand.Happiness is this, is this, he thought."
"“但为何要我邀请伦敦所有愚笨的女士都来赴宴啊？”克拉丽莎说着。要是马香夫人举办聚会，难道她会请所有客人吗？","“But why should I ask all the dull women in London to my parties?” said Clarissa.And if Mrs. Marsham gave a party, did SHE invite her guests?"
"“可悲的埃莉·亨德森。”理查德说——克拉丽莎那么介意自己的聚会真是一件相当古怪的事，他心想。","“Poor Ellie Henderson,” said Richard—it was a very odd thing how much Clarissa minded about her parties, he thought."
"不过理查德完全不懂一间屋子怎么摆设。不过——他要说什么呢？","But Richard had no notion of the look of a room.However—what was he going to say?"
"假如她担忧这些聚会，他就不想让她举办了。以前她想嫁给彼得吗？但他必须要走了。","If she worried about these parties he would not let her give them.Did she wish she had married Peter?But he must go."
"他必须要走了，他边说边站起身。但他站了一会儿似乎正打算说点什么，而她想知道他会说什么呢？为什么？会有玫瑰花。","He must be off, he said, getting up.But he stood for a moment as if he were about to say something; and she wondered what?Why?There were the roses."
"“某个委员会开会吗？”她在他打开门时问道。“有关亚美尼亚人。”他说，也可能是“阿尔巴尼亚人”。","“Some Committee?” she asked, as he opened the door.“Armenians,” he said; or perhaps it was “Albanians.”"
"人身上有一种崇高、一种孤寂。甚至夫妻间也会有隔阂，你不得不尊重这点，克拉丽莎边想边看着他开门。你自身不愿意失去它，也不愿违背自己丈夫的意愿从他身上夺走它，不然你就会失去独立，失去自尊——毕竟，这是无价的。","And there is a dignity in people; a solitude; even between husband and wife a gulf; and that one must respect, thought Clarissa, watching him open the door; for one would not part with it oneself, or take it, against his will, from one’s husband, without losing one’s independence, one’s self-respect—something, after all, priceless."
"他带着一个枕头和一条被子回来了。","He returned with a pillow and a quilt."
"“午饭后好好歇一小时。”他说道。随后他就走了。","“An hour’s complete rest after luncheon,” he said.And he went."
"他就是这种人！他会永远不停地唠叨“午饭后好好歇一小时”，因为这是一个医生曾嘱咐过的。他就是那种谨遵医嘱的人。这是他惹人喜爱、天性单纯的一种表现，没人达到这种程度。这种天性使他奔波于正事，然而她却与彼得耗费时间去斗嘴。他让她躺在沙发上，观赏他送的玫瑰，这时他已在去下议院的路上了，要去谈论他的亚美尼亚人，或他的阿尔巴尼亚人。人们会说：“克拉丽莎·达洛维被宠坏了。”她喜欢她的玫瑰远远胜过对亚美尼亚人的关注。那些被驱逐得生存不下去了、伤残了、冻僵了的人，是暴政与专制的牺牲品（她曾经听理查德反复地这样说）——不，她对阿尔巴尼亚人没有感到丝毫同情，或者说是亚美尼亚人？可是她喜欢她的玫瑰（难道那对亚美尼亚人没有帮助吗？）——她唯独能忍受这种花被人摘下来。可是理查德已经到了下议院，正在他的委员会上。他已经解决了她一切的困难。但是，不，天哪，不是这样。他不理解为什么她反对邀请埃莉·亨德森。她会请的，当然，像他期望的那样。他既然带枕头来了，她会躺一下。但是——但是——为何她毫无缘由地一下子觉得很伤感呢？她犹如一个在草丛中丢了一粒珍珠或一颗钻石的人，非常谨慎地分开这边那边高高的草叶，徒劳地四处搜寻，最终在某处草根边看见了。如此她回忆起件件往事。不对，并非因为萨利·西顿说过由于理查德的头脑是二流的，他永远进不了内阁（她想起这句话了），不是的，她不在乎那个。这也不关伊丽莎白与多丽丝·基尔曼的事，那些是事实。这是一种感觉，某种令人不愉快的感觉，可能一大清早就有了。是彼得说过什么导致的吧，加之她本人在卧室摘下帽子时感到有些沮丧，理查德说的什么事情也滋长了这感觉，不过他说什么了呢？那些是他的玫瑰。她的宴会！那就是了！她的宴会！他俩极不公平地批评了她，非常不公道地取笑她，就为了她的宴会。是这缘故！是这缘故！","How like him!He would go on saying “An hour’s complete rest after luncheon” to the end of time, because a doctor had ordered it once.It was like him to take what doctors said literally; part of his adorable, divine simplicity, which no one had to the same extent; which made him go and do the thing while she and Peter frittered their time away bickering.He was already halfway to the House of Commons, to his Armenians, his Albanians, having settled her on the sofa, looking at his roses.And people would say, “Clarissa Dalloway is spoilt.”She cared much more for her roses than for the Armenians.Hunted out of existence, maimed, frozen, the victims of cruelty and injustice (she had heard Richard say so over and over again)—no, she could feel nothing for the Albanians, or was it the Armenians?but she loved her roses (didn’t that help the Armenians?)—the only flowers she could bear to see cut.But Richard was already at the House of Commons; at his Committee, having settled all her difficulties.But no; alas, that was not true.He did not see the reasons against asking Ellie Henderson.She would do it, of course, as he wished it.Since he had brought the pillows, she would lie down....But—but—why did she suddenly feel, for no reason that she could discover, desperately unhappy?As a person who has dropped some grain of pearl or diamond into the grass and parts the tall blades very carefully, this way and that, and searches here and there vainly, and at last spies it there at the roots, so she went through one thing and another; no, it was not Sally Seton saying that Richard would never be in the Cabinet because he had a second-class brain (it came back to her); no, she did not mind that; nor was it to do with Elizabeth either and Doris Kilman; those were facts.It was a feeling, some unpleasant feeling, earlier in the day perhaps; something that Peter had said, combined with some depression of her own, in her bedroom, taking off her hat; and what Richard had said had added to it, but what had he said?There were his roses.Her parties!That was it!Her parties!Both of them criticised her very unfairly, laughed at her very unjustly, for her parties.That was it!That was it!"
"嗯，那她要怎么给自己辩解？因为她知道缘由了，于是感到非常高兴。他俩觉得，起码彼得觉得，她喜欢凸显自己，喜欢名流们围着她转，一些伟大的名字。总之她简直是个势力之徒。嗯，彼得也许如此认为。理查德只是觉得她傻傻的，她明知道兴奋对她心脏有害还爱热闹。真是孩子气，他会想。但两人完全错了。她喜欢简单的生活。","Well, how was she going to defend herself?Now that she knew what it was, she felt perfectly happy.They thought, or Peter at any rate thought, that she enjoyed imposing herself; liked to have famous people about her; great names; was simply a snob in short.Well, Peter might think so.Richard merely thought it foolish of her to like excitement when she knew it was bad for her heart.It was childish, he thought.And both were quite wrong.What she liked was simply life."
"“那就是我举办宴会的原因。”她对生活高声呐喊。","“That’s what I do it for,” she said, speaking aloud, to life."
"因为她在沙发上躺着，与世隔绝，不需要尽任何义务。她那么明显地感觉到这个东西成了具体存在的事物。从阳光灿烂、空气灼热的街上传来袍子的声音，低语着，吹动着百叶窗。不过如果彼得跟她讲：“不错，不错，但你那些聚会——那些聚会有何意思呢？”她能讲的只有（并且估计没人能理解）：它们是一种奉献；这听上去很模糊。可彼得算什么，凭什么认为生活尽是一帆风顺呢？彼得老是身陷情网，老是爱错女人？你的爱算什么？她可以问他。而她知道他的答案。爱是世上最重要的事，没哪个女人可以明白它。非常好。可又有哪个男人能够明白她的想法呢？关于生活的想法？她不能想像彼得或是理查德会无缘无故费力地举行一个聚会。","Since she was lying on the sofa, cloistered, exempt, the presence of this thing which she felt to be so obvious became physically existent; with robes of sound from the street, sunny, with hot breath, whispering, blowing out the blinds.But suppose Peter said to her, “Yes, yes, but your parties—what’s the sense of your parties?” all she could say was (and nobody could be expected to understand): They’re an offering; which sounded horribly vague.But who was Peter to make out that life was all plain sailing?-Peter always in love, always in love with the wrong woman?What’s your love?she might say to him.And she knew his answer; how it is the most important thing in the world and no woman possibly understood it.Very well.But could any man understand what she meant either?about life?She could not imagine Peter or Richard taking the trouble to give a party for no reason whatever."
"不过再想深入一些，在人们言论背后（而这些评判，是那样浅薄、那样片面），在她自己的内心里，这对她有什么意义，这就是她所谓的生活？哦，太奇怪了。某人在南肯辛顿，某人去了贝斯沃特，另一个人在梅弗尔。她一直不断地感受到他们的存在。她觉得这是多么地浪费，多么地遗憾，倘若能使他们聚到一起该多好啊。她便这么做了。这是一种奉献。为了联合，为了创造。可是奉献给谁呢？","But to go deeper, beneath what people said (and these judgements, how superficial, how fragmentary they are!) in her own mind now, what did it mean to her, this thing she called life?Oh, it was very queer.Here was So-and-so in South Kensington; some one up in Bayswater; and somebody else, say, in Mayfair.And she felt quite continuously a sense of their existence; and she felt what a waste; and she felt what a pity; and she felt if only they could be brought together; so she did it.And it was an offering; to combine, to create; but to whom?"
"可能是为奉献而奉献吧。至少，这是她的天赋。她没有其他任何有丝毫重要意义的才能了。她不会思考、写字、甚至不会弹钢琴。她把亚美尼亚人与土耳其人混淆了，喜欢成功，憎恨不适，一定得讨人喜欢，满嘴废话，至今，问她什么是赤道，她都不知道。尽管如此，一天一天接踵而至，周三、周四、周五、周六。你得在早晨醒来，看看天，在公园散散步，与休·惠特布雷德相遇，随后彼得忽然进来，之后是这些玫瑰，这就够了。那以后，死亡是多么让人难以置信啊！一切必然结束。而整个世上没有人会知道她怎样爱过这一切；怎样，每一刻……","An offering for the sake of offering, perhaps.Anyhow, it was her gift.Nothing else had she of the slightest importance; could not think, write, even play the piano.She muddled Armenians and Turks; loved success; hated discomfort; must be liked; talked oceans of nonsense: and to this day, ask her what the Equator was, and she did not know.All the same, that one day should follow another; Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday; that one should wake up in the morning; see the sky; walk in the park; meet Hugh Whitbread; then suddenly in came Peter; then these roses; it was enough.After that, how unbelievable death was!—that it must end; and no one in the whole world would know how she had loved it all; how, every instant..."
"门开了。伊丽莎白明白她的母亲在歇息。她很安静地进来。她纹丝不动地站着。或许一百年以前什么蒙古人在诺福克海岸沉了船（像希尔伯里夫人说的那样），与达洛维家里的几个女士有了纠缠？因为总的来说，达洛维一家都长着金发碧眼。","The door opened.Elizabeth knew that her mother was resting.She came in very quietly.She stood perfectly still.Was it that some Mongol had been wrecked on the coast of Norfolk (as Mrs. Hilbery said), had mixed with the Dalloway ladies, perhaps, a hundred years ago?For the Dalloways, in general, were fair-haired; blue-eyed;"
"伊丽莎白呢，正相反，头发乌黑，苍白的面孔上是一对中国式的眼睛。她有着东方人的神秘，温和、周到、安静。她孩童时有很棒的幽默感。可是到十七岁时就变得很严肃，克拉丽莎丝毫不知道这是为什么。她像一株风信子，被油亮的绿叶覆盖着，花蕾上只有一点点的颜色，一株缺乏阳光的风信子。","Elizabeth, on the contrary, was dark; had Chinese eyes in a pale face; an Oriental mystery; was gentle, considerate, still.As a child, she had had a perfect sense of humour; but now at seventeen, why, Clarissa could not in the least understand, she had become very serious; like a hyacinth, sheathed in glossy green, with buds just tinted, a hyacinth which has had no sun."
"她纹丝不动地站着，看着她的母亲。但门半掩着，基尔曼小姐在门外，如克拉丽莎清楚的那样。基尔曼小姐身穿雨衣，窃听她俩在谈些什么。","She stood quite still and looked at her mother; but the door was ajar, and outside the door was Miss Kilman, as Clarissa knew; Miss Kilman in her mackintosh, listening to whatever they said."
"是的，基尔曼小姐在楼梯平台上站着，身穿一袭雨衣，但是她有她的理由。第一，雨衣便宜；第二，她四十多岁了，毕竟穿什么不是为了取悦别人。而且，她穷，穷得丧失了体面。否则她不会为像达洛维那样的人家做事，为那些富裕的人家做事，那些人喜欢表现出善良的样子。公道地来讲，达洛维先生真的很和蔼。达洛维太太可不是。她只不过是恩赐罢了。她来自所有阶层中最无价值的一个阶层——富人阶层，有一点浅薄的文化素养。他们家满是奢侈品，图画、地毯、成群的佣人。她认为达洛维家无论为她做了什么，她都完全受之无愧。","Yes, Miss Kilman stood on the landing, and wore a mackintosh; but had her reasons.First, it was cheap; second, she was over forty; and did not, after all, dress to please.She was poor, moreover; degradingly poor.Otherwise she would not be taking jobs from people like the Dalloways; from rich people, who liked to be kind.Mr. Dalloway, to do him justice, had been kind.But Mrs. Dalloway had not.She had been merely condescending.She came from the most worthless of all classes—the rich, with a smattering of culture.They had expensive things everywhere; pictures, carpets, lots of servants.She considered that she had a perfect right to anything that the Dalloways did for her."
"她被欺骗了。不错，这并非夸大其辞，因为想必一位姑娘有权得到某种幸福吧。她可从未幸福过，她如此笨拙，如此贫穷。而且，正当她在多尔比小姐的学校也许有个机遇时，战事开始了。而她从不会撒谎。多尔比小姐觉得，和那些在看待德国人的问题上与自己观点一致的人呆在一起会更快乐。","She had been cheated.Yes, the word was no exaggeration, for surely a girl has a right to some kind of happiness?And she had never been happy, what with being so clumsy and so poor.And then, just as she might have had a chance at Miss Dolby’s school, the war came; and she had never been able to tell lies.Miss Dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the Germans."
"基尔曼一定要离开学校不可。她的家族的确有德国血统。在十八世纪的时候，她家族的姓氏拼作基艾尔曼，然而她的哥哥在战争中牺牲。　校方将她开除了，因为她不愿假意说德国人全是恶棍——那时她有些德国朋友，她一生中唯一快乐的时光是在德国度过的！而她毕竟可以读些历史。她不得不接受她能得到的任何工作。达洛维先生曾经在她为友谊会工作时撞见了她。他曾让她（他真是好心肠）为自己的女儿教历史。她也教一点兼职课等等。于是基督降临到她身上（这一刻她老是低下头去）。她见到圣光的时候是两年又三个月之前。如今她不妒忌克拉丽莎·达洛维之类的女人了，她同情她们。","She had had to go.It was true that the family was of German origin; spelt the name Kiehlman in the eighteenth century; but her brother had been killed.They turned her out because she would not pretend that the Germans were all villains—when she had German friends, when the only happy days of her life had been spent in Germany!And after all, she could read history.She had had to take whatever she could get.Mr. Dalloway had come across her working for the Friends.He had allowed her (and that was really generous of him) to teach his daughter history.Also she did a little Extension lecturing and so on.Then Our Lord had come to her (and here she always bowed her head).She had seen the light two years and three months ago.Now she did not envy women like Clarissa Dalloway; she pitied them."
"她从心底里同情又鄙夷她们，此时她站在柔软的地毯上，注视着刻有戴皮手筒的一个小女孩的古老雕刻画。全是这种奢侈品，还怎么指望有更好的情形呢？她不应在沙发上躺着——","She pitied and despised them from the bottom of her heart, as she stood on the soft carpet, looking at the old engraving of a little girl with a muff.With all this luxury going on, what hope was there for a better state of things?Instead of lying on a sofa—"
"“我母亲在歇息。”伊丽莎白说道。她本应在工厂做事，守柜台，达洛维夫人以及所有其他的贵妇人都应如此！","“My mother is resting,” Elizabeth had said—she should have been in a factory; behind a counter; Mrs. Dalloway and all the other fine ladies!"
"两年又三个月之前，基尔曼小姐怀着痛苦与焦虑去了一间教堂。她聆听了爱德华·惠特克牧师的传道，听到男孩们在咏唱，见到神圣之光的降临，是否因为音乐或是声音（她本人独自在夜里时常拉小提琴以求得安慰，不过她的琴声让人难以忍受，她没什么乐感），她坐在教堂时，心里汹涌澎湃的、愤怒的情感平息下来。她泪如雨下，还去造访惠特克先生在肯辛顿区的私人住宅。这是上帝之手，他说道。上帝给她指了路。所以现在，每当她心中涌起恼怒而痛苦的情愫，涌起对达洛维夫人的仇恨，涌起对世界的不满时，她就想到了上帝。她也想到了惠特克先生。盛怒就为冷静所取代。一种甜蜜的感觉充满了她的血管。她的嘴唇微微张开，穿着雨衣可怕地站在楼道平台上。她用一种沉着而阴险的目光注视着和女儿一起出来的达洛维夫人。","Bitter and burning, Miss Kilman had turned into a church two years three months ago.She had heard the Rev. Edward Whittaker preach; the boys sing; had seen the solemn lights descend, and whether it was the music, or the voices (she herself when alone in the evening found comfort in a violin; but the sound was excruciating; she had no ear), the hot and turbulent feelings which boiled and surged in her had been assuaged as she sat there, and she had wept copiously, and gone to call on Mr. Whittaker at his private house in Kensington.It was the hand of God, he said.The Lord had shown her the way.So now, whenever the hot and painful feelings boiled within her, this hatred of Mrs. Dalloway, this grudge against the world, she thought of God.She thought of Mr. Whittaker.Rage was succeeded by calm.A sweet savour filled her veins, her lips parted, and, standing formidable upon the landing in her mackintosh, she looked with steady and sinister serenity at Mrs. Dalloway, who came out with her daughter."
"伊丽莎白说她忘记戴手套了。那是由于基尔曼小姐与她的母亲之间彼此讨厌。她看见她们在一起就不能忍受。她跑到楼上找她的手套了。","Elizabeth said she had forgotten her gloves.That was because Miss Kilman and her mother hated each other.She could not bear to see them together.She ran upstairs to find her gloves."
"然而基尔曼小姐并不憎恨达洛维夫人。这时她自己醋栗色的大眼睛转向了克拉丽莎，端详着她的红色的小脸蛋，她娇小的身体，她清新时尚的派头。基尔曼小姐感觉是，真是傻子！白痴！你这个既没受过苦也没享过乐的人，你这个虚度生命的人！于是她内心升起一种势不可档的渴望，想要战胜克拉丽莎，想要揭开她的面具。要是基尔曼小姐能够把她打倒，她就会觉得很轻松。可她并不想打击克拉丽莎的躯体，她想要征服她的灵魂及其伪装，让其感受到自己的控制。基尔曼小姐真希望能使她哭泣，能毁掉她，使她丢脸，迫使她跪下哭喊道：你是正确的！不过这是神的意志，并非基尔曼小姐的意图。那将是宗教的成功。她是那样瞪大了眼，她是那样怒视着。","But Miss Kilman did not hate Mrs. Dalloway.Turning her large gooseberry-coloured eyes upon Clarissa, observing her small pink face, her delicate body, her air of freshness and fashion, Miss Kilman felt, Fool!Simpleton!You who have known neither sorrow nor pleasure; who have trifled your life away!And there rose in her an overmastering desire to overcome her; to unmask her.If she could have felled her it would have eased her.But it was not the body; it was the soul and its mockery that she wished to subdue; make feel her mastery.If only she could make her weep; could ruin her; humiliate her; bring her to her knees crying, You are right!But this was God’s will, not Miss Kilman’s.It was to be a religious victory.So she glared; so she glowered."
"克拉丽莎的确吓坏了。这个基督教徒——这个女人！这个女人从她身边夺去了她的女儿！她竟感受到神灵的存在！她肥胖、难看、平庸、不善良也不优雅，却知道生活的涵义！","Clarissa was really shocked.This a Christian—this woman!This woman had taken her daughter from her!She in touch with invisible presences!Heavy, ugly, commonplace, without kindness or grace, she know the meaning of life!"
"“你把伊丽莎白带到商店去吗？”达洛维夫人问道。","“You are taking Elizabeth to the Stores?” Mrs. Dalloway said."
"基尔曼小姐回答说是。她俩在那里站着。基尔曼小姐没有想要讨人喜欢。她总是自谋生路。她对现代史有极其透彻精辟的了解。她从自己菲薄的积蓄中留出一大笔钱用于她信奉的事业。但这个女人什么也没做，什么也不信奉，把自己女儿教养成——这下伊丽莎白来了，有些喘不过气，这漂亮的女孩。","Miss Kilman said she was.They stood there.Miss Kilman was not going to make herself agreeable.She had always earned her living.Her knowledge of modern history was thorough in the extreme.She did out of her meagre income set aside so much for causes she believed in; whereas this woman did nothing, believed nothing; brought up her daughter—but here was Elizabeth, rather out of breath, the beautiful girl."
"那么她俩打算到商店去了。好奇怪，基尔曼小姐在那里站着时（她真的在那里站着，像一只披着铠甲准备进行一场史前战斗的野兽，带着力量与沉默），伴随分分秒秒的逝去，克拉丽莎对她的想法逐渐减少，憎恶（是对思想的憎恶，而非对人的憎恶）在瓦解。她的狠毒、她的块头消失了，伴随分分秒秒的逝去她变回了基尔曼小姐的本来面目，穿着雨衣，天知道克拉丽莎是想要帮助她呀。","So they were going to the Stores.Odd it was, as Miss Kilman stood there (and stand she did, with the power and taciturnity of some prehistoric monster armoured for primeval warfare), how, second by second, the idea of her diminished, how hatred (which was for ideas, not people) crumbled, how she lost her malignity, her size, became second by second merely Miss Kilman, in a mackintosh, whom Heaven knows Clarissa would have liked to help."
"看到这个怪物渐渐变小，克拉丽莎大笑起来。她一边说再会了，一边大笑。","At this dwindling of the monster, Clarissa laughed.Saying good-bye, she laughed."
"她俩，即基尔曼小姐与伊丽莎白两人，一同下楼去了。","Off they went together, Miss Kilman and Elizabeth, downstairs."
"克拉丽莎受到一股忽然的刺激，觉得有种强烈的悲痛，因为这女人夺走了她女儿。克拉丽莎斜倚在栏杆上，大声喊道：“记得聚会啊！记得我们今晚有聚会啊！”","With a sudden impulse, with a violent anguish, for this woman was taking her daughter from her, Clarissa leant over the bannisters and cried out, “Remember the party!Remember our party tonight!”"
"可伊丽莎白已打开前门，外面有辆运货车经过，她并未应答。","But Elizabeth had already opened the front door; there was a van passing; she did not answer."
"爱与宗教！克拉丽莎思忖着，回到了客厅，周身都有刺痛之感。这两者是多么可恶，多么可恶呀！现在基尔曼小姐的身体没有在她面前，打败她的是——这个观念。看到她们笨拙、激动、跋扈、伪善、窃听、妒忌、残忍至极又肆无忌惮，穿着一件雨衣外套站在楼梯平台上，是世界上最残忍的事情。爱与宗教。难道她自己曾设法转变任何一个人的信仰吗？难道她不希望每个人都只做自己吗？她从窗口往外望去，对面那位老妇人正在爬楼。要是她想爬楼就任她爬上去，让她停住。然后让她如克拉丽莎常见到的那样，来到卧室，打开窗帘，接着又一次消失在视野中。不知怎么，人们会尊敬那些举动——那老妇人向窗外望去，根本未察觉出有人注视着她。这景象有着几分庄重——不过爱与宗教会破坏它，无论它是什么，如灵魂的私密。那个讨厌的基尔曼会破坏它。然而这是一个令克拉丽莎想哭的景象。","Love and religion!thought Clarissa, going back into the drawing-room, tingling all over.How detestable, how detestable they are!For now that the body of Miss Kilman was not before her, it overwhelmed her—the idea.The cruelest things in the world, she thought, seeing them clumsy, hot, domineering, hypocritical, eavesdropping, jealous, infinitely cruel and unscrupulous, dressed in a mackintosh coat, on the landing; love and religion.Had she ever tried to convert any one herself?Did she not wish everybody merely to be themselves?And she watched out of the window the old lady opposite climbing upstairs.Let her climb upstairs if she wanted to; let her stop; then let her, as Clarissa had often seen her, gain her bedroom, part her curtains, and disappear again into the background.Somehow one respected that—that old woman looking out of the window, quite unconscious that she was being watched.There was something solemn in it—but love and religion would destroy that, whatever it was, the privacy of the soul.The odious Kilman would destroy it.Yet it was a sight that made her want to cry."
"爱也会搞破坏。破坏每一件美好的事物，每一件真切的事物。用彼得·沃尔什举个例子。他是个迷人而聪明的男人，事事都有自己的观点。比如要是你想要了解教皇，或爱迪生，或只是胡说一气，诸如人们是怎么样的，事情有什么意义，彼得比任何人都清楚。正是彼得帮过她的忙，正是彼得把书借给她。然而瞧瞧他爱的那些女人——俗气、微不足道、平庸。想起彼得恋爱的情形——这些年以后他来探望她，而他谈了些什么？就他自己。恐怖的激情！她心想。可耻的激情！她寻思着，想起基尔曼与她的伊丽莎白正走向陆海军商店。","Love destroyed too.Everything that was fine, everything that was true went.Take Peter Walsh now.There was a man, charming, clever, with ideas about everything.If you wanted to know about Pope, say, or Addison, or just to talk nonsense, what people were like, what things meant, Peter knew better than any one.It was Peter who had helped her; Peter who had lent her books.But look at the women he loved—vulgar, trivial, commonplace.Think of Peter in love—he came to see her after all these years, and what did he talk about?Himself.Horrible passion! she thought.Degrading passion!she thought, thinking of Kilman and her Elizabeth walking to the Army and Navy Stores."
"大本钟响起了半点钟的钟声。","Big Ben struck the half-hour."
"这多特别，多奇怪啊，的确，多动人啊，眼见那老妇人（她们已是好多年的邻居了）从窗口走开，似乎她附属于那钟声、那根弦。像这样洪亮的钟声却与这老妇人有关。钟声如手指般向下、向下，伸进平凡事物中，使那一刻显得肃穆。克拉丽莎设想，老妇人是在钟声的强迫下挪动、走开——可是去哪里呢？她转身不见时，克拉丽莎设法盯着她，仍然能恍惚瞧见她戴着的白帽子在卧室后方晃动。她还在那里，在屋子另一端走动。为何有教条、祈祷、雨衣啊？克拉丽莎寻思，那是个奇迹，那是种神秘。她意指那位老妇人，这时她可以瞧见老妇人从衣柜走向梳妆台。她还可以瞧见那老妇人。而基尔曼可能说她已经解开那至高无上的神秘。或者彼得也许说他已解开了这神秘。然而克拉丽莎完全不相信他们知道如何解开它，那至上的神秘仅仅是：这里是一间屋子；那里是另一间屋子。难道宗教，或者爱，解开那神秘了吗？","How extraordinary it was, strange, yes, touching, to see the old lady (they had been neighbours ever so many years) move away from the window, as if she were attached to that sound, that string.Gigantic as it was, it had something to do with her.Down, down, into the midst of ordinary things the finger fell making the moment solemn.She was forced, so Clarissa imagined, by that sound, to move, to go—but where?Clarissa tried to follow her as she turned and disappeared, and could still just see her white cap moving at the back of the bedroom.She was still there moving about at the other end of the room.Why creeds and prayers and mackintoshes?when, thought Clarissa, that’s the miracle, that’s the mystery; that old lady, she meant, whom she could see going from chest of drawers to dressing-table.She could still see her.And the supreme mystery which Kilman might say she had solved, or Peter might say he had solved, but Clarissa didn’t believe either of them had the ghost of an idea of solving, was simply this: here was one room; there another.Did religion solve that, or love?"
"爱——不过此时另一座钟敲响了，它老是比大本钟晚两分钟，它拖着脚步，衣兜中放满了零碎物，把它们都倒在地上。仿佛表示，大本钟富有权威地制定法律倒也不错，那么严肃，那么公正。不过她必须记得除此之外各式各样的琐碎事情——马香夫人、埃莉·亨德森、装冰块的玻璃杯子——大本钟庄严的钟声像平躺在海上的一块金子，紧跟着，那些琐碎的事情如浪涛般涌动着、轻拍着、跳跃着。马香夫人、埃莉·亨德森、装冰块的玻璃杯子。她此时得立刻拨打电话。","Love—but here the other clock, the clock which always struck two minutes after Big Ben, came shuffling in with its lap full of odds and ends, which it dumped down as if Big Ben were all very well with his majesty laying down the law, so solemn, so just, but she must remember all sorts of little things besides—Mrs. Marsham, Ellie Henderson, glasses for ices—all sorts of little things came flooding and lapping and dancing in on the wake of that solemn stroke which lay flat like a bar of gold on the sea.Mrs. Marsham, Ellie Henderson, glasses for ices.She must telephone now at once."
"那座慢钟喋喋不休地、纷乱地响着，紧随着大本钟，它的衣兜中放满了琐屑之物。马车的攻击、货车的粗暴、无数急切前进的瘦削男人及招摇的女人、办公楼和医院的圆顶与尖顶将钟声打破了、搅乱了。衣兜中放满零碎物的钟声最终的余音宛如疲惫的波浪溅起的浪花，溅在基尔曼小姐身上。她直挺挺地在街上站了一会儿，喃喃道：“这是肉体的原因。”","Volubly, troublously, the late clock sounded, coming in on the wake of Big Ben, with its lap full of trifles.Beaten up, broken up by the assault of carriages, the brutality of vans, the eager advance of myriads of angular men, of flaunting women, the domes and spires of offices and hospitals, the last relics of this lap full of odds and ends seemed to break, like the spray of an exhausted wave, upon the body of Miss Kilman standing still in the street for a moment to mutter “It is the flesh.”"
"她一定要掌控的是肉体。克拉丽莎·达洛维侮辱她了。那是她预料到的。可她没有得胜，她没有控制肉体。克拉丽莎·达洛维因她难看、笨拙而取笑她，于是重新激活了她肉体的欲望，因为她介意在克拉丽莎身旁时自己的形象。她口才也无法和克拉丽莎相比。但她为何想要像克拉丽莎呢？为何呢？她打心坎里瞧不起达洛维夫人。她并不庄重。她并不善良。她的生活是一派浮华与谎言。但是多丽丝·基尔曼被她战胜了。事实上，克拉丽莎·达洛维取笑她时，她几乎要大哭出来。“这是肉体的原因，这是肉体的原因。”她喃喃道（她习惯高声说话），她沿着维多利亚街走着的时候，试图克制住这涌动的、悲痛的情绪。她向上帝祷告。她的难看是不由自主的，她没钱买好看的衣裳。克拉丽莎·达洛维取笑她了——不过在她到达邮筒那里之前，她会把精力集中在其他事情上。至少她拥有了伊丽莎白。不过她会想想其他事情，她会想想俄国，然后到达邮筒那里。","It was the flesh that she must control.Clarissa Dalloway had insulted her.That she expected.But she had not triumphed; she had not mastered the flesh.Ugly, clumsy, Clarissa Dalloway had laughed at her for being that; and had revived the fleshly desires, for she minded looking as she did beside Clarissa.Nor could she talk as she did.But why wish to resemble her?Why?She despised Mrs. Dalloway from the bottom of her heart.She was not serious.She was not good.Her life was a tissue of vanity and deceit.Yet Doris Kilman had been overcome.She had, as a matter of fact, very nearly burst into tears when Clarissa Dalloway laughed at her.“It is the flesh, it is the flesh,” she muttered (it being her habit to talk aloud) trying to subdue this turbulent and painful feeling as she walked down Victoria Street.She prayed to God.She could not help being ugly; she could not afford to buy pretty clothes.Clarissa Dalloway had laughed—but she would concentrate her mind upon something else until she had reached the pillar-box.At any rate she had got Elizabeth.But she would think of something else; she would think of Russia; until she reached the pillar-box."
"她说道，要是能像惠特克先生告诉她的那样，在乡间同自身对世界强烈的仇恨情绪作斗争该多好啊。这个世界鄙视她、讥笑她、丢弃她。从这种侮辱开始——强加给她一个人们不忍一见的不可爱的身体。不管她头发梳成什么样，她的前额依然像只蛋，秃秃的、白白的。没有衣服适合她。买任何东西都无济于事。对一个女人而言，那当然意味着永远接触不到异性。她从来没有主动与任何一个人接触。最近，她有时仿佛觉得，除伊丽莎白以外，她只为食物而活着，为她的舒适、她的正餐、她的茶点、她夜里的热水袋。然而人一定得战斗、战胜、信仰上帝。惠特克先生曾说她活在世界上是有目的的。但无人知晓那极大的苦痛！他指向十字架说道，上帝知道。然而为何她必须要遭罪，而其他女人呢，比如克拉丽莎·达洛维就能逃避呢？知识来源于痛苦，惠特克先生说道。","How nice it must be, she said, in the country, struggling, as Mr. Whittaker had told her, with that violent grudge against the world which had scorned her, sneered at her, cast her off, beginning with this indignity—the infliction of her unlovable body which people could not bear to see.Do her hair as she might, her forehead remained like an egg, bald, white.No clothes suited her.She might buy anything.And for a woman, of course, that meant never meeting the opposite sex.Never would she come first with any one.Sometimes lately it had seemed to her that, except for Elizabeth, her food was all that she lived for; her comforts; her dinner, her tea; her hot-water bottle at night.But one must fight; vanquish; have faith in God.Mr. Whittaker had said she was there for a purpose.But no one knew the agony!He said, pointing to the crucifix, that God knew.But why should she have to suffer when other women, like Clarissa Dalloway, escaped?Knowledge comes through suffering, said Mr. Whittaker."
"她从邮筒旁走过去了，而伊丽莎白已转身走进陆海军商店中凉快的褐色烟草部，而她还在咕哝，念叨惠特克先生所讲的有关知识来源于痛苦，以及肉体的问题。“肉体啊。”她咕哝着。","She had passed the pillar-box, and Elizabeth had turned into the cool brown tobacco department of the Army and Navy Stores while she was still muttering to herself what Mr. Whittaker had said about knowledge coming through suffering and the flesh.“The flesh,” she muttered."
"您想去哪个部门？伊丽莎白打断了她。","What department did she want? Elizabeth interrupted her."
"“卖裙子的。”她唐突地回答，大步径直走向电梯。","“Petticoats,” she said abruptly, and stalked straight on to the lift."
"她们上了楼。伊丽莎白带着她绕来绕去。基尔曼神情恍惚地由她领着，仿佛她是一个大孩子，一艘拙笨的军舰。这里有各式各样的裙子，褐色的、高雅的、带条纹的、轻佻的、结实的、轻薄的。她神情恍惚、盛气凌人地挑拣着，卖东西的女孩认为她疯了。","Up they went.Elizabeth guided her this way and that; guided her in her abstraction as if she had been a great child, an unwieldy battleship.There were the petticoats, brown, decorous, striped, frivolous, solid, flimsy; and she chose, in her abstraction, portentously, and the girl serving thought her mad."
"她们打包物品时，伊丽莎白很想知道，基尔曼小姐在想什么呢。她们得喝茶了，基尔曼小姐说道，她清醒过来了，镇定了下来。她们于是就喝了茶。","Elizabeth rather wondered, as they did up the parcel, what Miss Kilman was thinking.They must have their tea, said Miss Kilman, rousing, collecting herself.They had their tea."
"伊丽莎白很想知道基尔曼小姐是否饿了。她以自己的方式吃着，一门心思地吃，接着一次又一次地望着紧邻桌子上的一碟糖衣蛋糕。然后，一位夫人领着小孩坐到桌边，孩子吃了蛋糕，基尔曼小姐会真的介意吗？不错，基尔曼小姐的确介意此事。她本想吃那蛋糕——粉红的那个。吃东西的快乐差不多是她仅存的真正的快乐，然而就连这点她都得不到满足！","Elizabeth rather wondered whether Miss Kilman could be hungry.It was her way of eating, eating with intensity, then looking, again and again, at a plate of sugared cakes on the table next them; then, when a lady and a child sat down and the child took the cake, could Miss Kilman really mind it?Yes, Miss Kilman did mind it.She had wanted that cake—the pink one.The pleasure of eating was almost the only pure pleasure left her, and then to be baffled even in that!"
"她给伊丽莎白讲过，人们快乐时就有一种可以支取的储备。但是她宛如一个少了轮胎的车轮（她喜欢这种譬喻），遇到每一块卵石都会摇晃。周二上午的课结束以后，她会呆上一会儿，站在壁炉旁，拿着一袋书，她管它叫“书包”，她说着这类的话。而她也讨论战事。说到底，有人认为英国人并非始终是正确的。书上是这样的。还有会议。也有其他见解。伊丽莎白想要跟她去聆听某人的演讲吗（那是一位相貌不凡的老头）？然后基尔曼小姐把她带到肯辛顿的一座教堂，她们与一个教士喝了茶。她借了一些书给伊丽莎白。有法律、医药、政治等，对你们这代女人而言所有职业都是开放着的，基尔曼小姐说道。不过对她自己而言，她的事业完全被毁掉了，难道是她的错吗？天啊，伊丽莎白说道，不。","When people are happy, they have a reserve, she had told Elizabeth, upon which to draw, whereas she was like a wheel without a tyre (she was fond of such metaphors), jolted by every pebble, so she would say staying on after the lesson standing by the fire-place with her bag of books, her “satchel,” she called it, on a Tuesday morning, after the lesson was over.And she talked too about the war.After all, there were people who did not think the English invariably right.There were books.There were meetings.There were other points of view.Would Elizabeth like to come with her to listen to So-and-so (a most extraordinary looking old man)?Then Miss Kilman took her to some church in Kensington and they had tea with a clergyman.She had lent her books.Law, medicine, politics, all professions are open to women of your generation, said Miss Kilman.But for herself, her career was absolutely ruined and was it her fault?Good gracious, said Elizabeth, no."
"有时候伊丽莎白的母亲会打来电话说，从伯顿送来了一大篮东西，基尔曼小姐想要些鲜花吗？克拉丽莎对待基尔曼小姐向来十分、十分友好，但基尔曼小姐将所有的花都扎成一束，却没寒暄一句。基尔曼小姐感兴趣的事伊丽莎白的母亲感到无趣。这两人在一起真可怕。基尔曼小姐骄傲自大，看起来却非常普通。但另一方面基尔曼小姐非常聪明。伊丽莎白从未想过穷困之人。他们家什么都不缺——她母亲天天都在床上进早餐。露西把早餐端到楼上。她喜欢那些老奶奶因为她们是公爵夫人，祖先还是什么勋爵。可基尔曼小姐说道（一个周二上午的课后）：“我祖父在肯辛顿经营过一个油画颜料商店。”基尔曼小姐让人觉得自己微不足道。","And her mother would come calling to say that a hamper had come from Bourton and would Miss Kilman like some flowers?To Miss Kilman she was always very, very nice, but Miss Kilman squashed the flowers all in a bunch, and hadn’t any small talk, and what interested Miss Kilman bored her mother, and Miss Kilman and she were terrible together; and Miss Kilman swelled and looked very plain.But then Miss Kilman was frightfully clever.Elizabeth had never thought about the poor.They lived with everything they wanted,—her mother had breakfast in bed every day; Lucy carried it up; and she liked old women because they were Duchesses, and being descended from some Lord.But Miss Kilman said (one of those Tuesday mornings when the lesson was over), “My grandfather kept an oil and colour shop in Kensington.”Miss Kilman made one feel so small."
"基尔曼小姐又饮完一杯茶。伊丽莎白一派东方神韵，显出难以言喻的神秘，笔直地坐着。不，她不想再吃了。她在寻找自己的手套——她白色的手套。它们在桌子下面。哎，但她不能走！基尔曼小姐不准她走！这位少女，如此美丽，这位姑娘，基尔曼由衷地爱着她。基尔曼的大手在桌上伸开又合拢。","Miss Kilman took another cup of tea.Elizabeth, with her oriental bearing, her inscrutable mystery, sat perfectly upright; no, she did not want anything more.She looked for her gloves—her white gloves.They were under the table.Ah, but she must not go!Miss Kilman could not let her go!this youth, that was so beautiful, this girl, whom she genuinely loved!Her large hand opened and shut on the table."
"可不知为何，或许有些沉闷，伊丽莎白感到。她真是想要离开。","But perhaps it was a little flat somehow, Elizabeth felt.And really she would like to go."
"不过基尔曼小姐说：“我还没有喝完。”","But said Miss Kilman, “I’ve not quite finished yet.”"
"因此，伊丽莎白当然会等一等。可这里相当憋闷。","Of course, then, Elizabeth would wait.But it was rather stuffy in here."
"“你今晚要去参加聚会吗？”基尔曼小姐说。伊丽莎白觉得自己会去，她的母亲希望她去。她不能被聚会吸引住了，基尔曼小姐说道，一边用手指抚弄着吃剩的最后一小截长条形巧克力小蛋糕。","“Are you going to the party tonight?” Miss Kilman said.Elizabeth supposed she was going; her mother wanted her to go.She must not let parties absorb her, Miss Kilman said, fingering the last two inches of a chocolate éclair."
"她不是很喜欢聚会，伊丽莎白说道。基尔曼小姐咧开嘴巴，稍微向前伸了伸下巴，吞下了最后一小块巧克力蛋糕，接着擦了下她的手指，搅动着杯中的茶。","She did not much like parties, Elizabeth said.Miss Kilman opened her mouth, slightly projected her chin, and swallowed down the last inches of the chocolate éclair, then wiped her fingers, and washed the tea round in her cup."
"她觉得自己就要裂开了。这悲痛如此可怕。如果她能抓紧伊丽莎白，能拥抱她，能让她绝对地、永远地属于她，然后死掉。那就是她想要的一切。可在这里坐着，想不出任何话说，眼见伊丽莎白开始反感她，甚至这姑娘都讨厌她——太过分啦，她受不了。她的粗手指向里握拢。","She was about to split asunder, she felt.The agony was so terrific.If she could grasp her, if she could clasp her, if she could make her hers absolutely and forever and then die; that was all she wanted.But to sit here, unable to think of anything to say; to see Elizabeth turning against her; to be felt repulsive even by her—it was too much; she could not stand it.The thick fingers curled inwards."
"“我从不参加宴会。”基尔曼小姐说道，只是为了不想让伊丽莎白去。“没人请我去赴宴。”她说这话时就知道，正是这样自我中心主义毁了她。惠特克先生曾告诫过她，但她对此不能自已。她蒙受了那么可怕的苦痛。“为何他们邀请我啊？”她说道，“我长得普通，我不开心。”她明白这么说如白痴一般。可全是由于那些来来去去的人们——携着大包小包的鄙视她的人，他们令她说了这话。然而，她就是多丽丝·基尔曼。她得过学位。她是个凭自己的奋斗获得成功的女人。她在现代史方面的知识是相当令人尊敬的。","“I never go to parties,” said Miss Kilman, just to keep Elizabeth from going.“People don’t ask me to parties”—and she knew as she said it that it was this egotism that was her undoing; Mr. Whittaker had warned her; but she could not help it.She had suffered so horribly.“Why should they ask me?” she said.“I’m plain, I’m unhappy.”She knew it was idiotic.But it was all those people passing—people with parcels who despised her, who made her say it.However, she was Doris Kilman.She had her degree.She was a woman who had made her way in the world.Her knowledge of modern history was more than respectable."
"“我不怜悯自己。”她说道。“我怜悯，”她想说的是，“你的母亲。”可不行，她不能，不能这样对伊丽莎白说。“我怜悯其他人，”她说，“比我自己多。”","“I don’t pity myself,” she said.“I pity”—she meant to say “your mother” but no, she could not, not to Elizabeth.“I pity other people,” she said, “more.”"
"伊丽莎白·达洛维安静地坐着，犹如一只说不出话的动物，不知何故就被带到一个门边，站在那里渴望疾驰而去。基尔曼小姐还要再说什么吗？","Like some dumb creature who has been brought up to a gate for an unknown purpose, and stands there longing to gallop away, Elizabeth Dalloway sat silent.Was Miss Kilman going to say anything more?"
"“不要彻底忘记我啊。”多丽丝·基尔曼说道，她的声音在颤抖。这只说不出话的动物在恐惧之下立刻就奔到田野的尽头。","“Don’t quite forget me,” said Doris Kilman; her voice quivered.Right away to the end of the field the dumb creature galloped in terror."
"那只大手张开了，又收拢。","The great hand opened and shut."
"伊丽莎白回过头来。女服务员走来了。得有人去帐台付钱，伊丽莎白说完就离开了。基尔曼小姐感到她把自己身体里的心肝都扯出来了，她走过餐厅时越拉越长，尔后，她最后一扭，相当客气地鞠了一躬，便离开了。","Elizabeth turned her head.The waitress came.One had to pay at the desk, Elizabeth said, and went off, drawing out, so Miss Kilman felt, the very entrails in her body, stretching them as she crossed the room, and then, with a final twist, bowing her head very politely, she went."
"她走了。基尔曼小姐坐在放着巧克力蛋糕的大理石桌边，一阵阵疼痛折磨着她，一下、两下、三下。她走了。达洛维夫人获胜了。伊丽莎白走了。美消失了，青春消逝了。","She had gone.Miss Kilman sat at the marble table among the éclair, stricken once, twice, thrice by shocks of suffering.She had gone.Mrs. Dalloway had triumphed.Elizabeth had gone.Beauty had gone, youth had gone."
"基尔曼就这么坐着。她站了起来，在小餐桌间踉踉跄跄，左右微微摇晃。有人拿着她的裙子追了上来。她迷路了，被包围在为了运往印度而特制的一个个衣箱中，接着走进产妇用品系列，以及婴儿内衣中间，穿过了世上一切商品，易坏的和耐用的，火腿、药物、鲜花、文具，味道各异，有甜的、有酸的。她步履蹒跚，在一面大镜子前瞧见自己帽子歪戴着、脸色通红、东倒西歪地走，终于走到了街上。","So she sat.She got up, blundered off among the little tables, rocking slightly from side to side, and somebody came after her with her petticoat, and she lost her way, and was hemmed in by trunks specially prepared for taking to India; next got among the accouchement sets, and baby linen; through all the commodities of the world, perishable and permanent, hams, drugs, flowers, stationery, variously smelling, now sweet, now sour she lurched; saw herself thus lurching with her hat askew, very red in the face, full length in a looking-glass; and at last came out into the street."
"她前面耸立着威斯敏斯特大教堂的塔，那是上帝的寓所。上帝的寓所就在这车水马龙之间。她携着包顽强地径直走向另一座圣殿，就是威斯敏斯特大教堂。在那里，她把双手举成帐篷状摆在面前，坐在那些同样是被迫来寻求庇护的人旁边。形形色色的礼拜者此刻都不分社会地位，几乎连性别都不分，举起双手摆在面前。可是一旦他们移开双手，马上表现出英国中产阶级男男女女虔敬的样子。他们有的人渴想去参观蜡像。","The tower of Westminster Cathedral rose in front of her, the habitation of God.In the midst of the traffic, there was the habitation of God.Doggedly she set off with her parcel to that other sanctuary, the Abbey, where, raising her hands in a tent before her face, she sat beside those driven into shelter too; the variously assorted worshippers, now divested of social rank, almost of sex, as they raised their hands before their faces; but once they removed them, instantly reverent, middle class, English men and women, some of them desirous of seeing the wax works."
"然而基尔曼小姐搭成帐篷的双手还放在面前。时而她身边有人离开，时而有人坐下来。从街上又走来一些礼拜者取代了闲逛的人。在人们环顾周围、拖着步子经过无名勇士墓的时候，她仍然用手指挡住眼睛，试图在这双重黑暗中（因为大教堂里的光线是无形的）追求超越虚荣、欲望、商品的东西，摆脱自身的恨与爱。她的双手抽搐着。她好像在斗争。但对其他人而言上帝是容易接近的，通往上帝的路是平坦的。已退休的财政部官员弗莱彻先生，一位英国王室知名法律顾问的遗孀戈勒姆太太，轻易就靠近上帝了。他们祈祷完毕就朝后靠着，欣赏着音乐（风琴美妙地鸣响着），瞧见基尔曼小姐坐在同一排的一端，祷告啊，祷告啊。由于他们依然在地狱的门槛上，所以怜悯地把她当作一个在同样的土地上萦绕不散的魂灵，一个用虚无之物形成的魂灵，并非一个女人，而是个魂灵。","But Miss Kilman held her tent before her face.Now she was deserted; now rejoined.New worshippers came in from the street to replace the strollers, and still, as people gazed round and shuffled past the tomb of the Unknown Warrior, still she barred her eyes with her fingers and tried in this double darkness, for the light in the Abbey was bodiless, to aspire above the vanities, the desires, the commodities, to rid herself both of hatred and of love.Her hands twitched.She seemed to struggle.Yet to others God was accessible and the path to Him smooth.Mr. Fletcher, retired, of the Treasury, Mrs. Gorham, widow of the famous K.C., approached Him simply, and having done their praying, leant back, enjoyed the music (the organ pealed sweetly), and saw Miss Kilman at the end of the row, praying, praying, and, being still on the threshold of their underworld, thought of her sympathetically as a soul haunting the same territory; a soul cut out of immaterial substance; not a woman, a soul."
"不过弗莱彻先生不得不离开了。他不得不经过她跟前，他自己穿着十分整洁，于是不由自主地为这个可怜的女士的邋遢生出一些伤感。她的头发披散下来，她的包掉到地上。她没有马上让他过去。不过，在他站着四下张望、凝视着白色的大理石和灰灰的窗玻璃、还有长期收集起来的珍贵物品（他为威斯敏斯特寺感到非常骄傲）时，她坐在那里时而移动双膝（她靠近上帝的路是那么坎坷——她的欲望是那么强烈），她庞大的身躯、强健的体魄和具有的力量令他印象深刻，正如这些也使达洛维夫人（那个下午她没办法不想基尔曼）、爱德华·惠特克教士以及伊丽莎白印象深刻。","But Mr. Fletcher had to go.He had to pass her, and being himself neat as a new pin, could not help being a little distressed by the poor lady’s disorder; her hair down; her parcel on the floor.She did not at once let him pass.But, as he stood gazing about him, at the white marbles, grey window panes, and accumulated treasures (for he was extremely proud of the Abbey), her largeness, robustness, and power as she sat there shifting her knees from time to time (it was so rough the approach to her God—so tough her desires) impressed him, as they had impressed Mrs. Dalloway (she could not get the thought of her out of her mind that afternoon),  the Rev. Edward Whittaker, and Elizabeth too."
"而伊丽莎白在维多利亚大街上等候公共汽车。出门多愉快啊。她认为现在可能还不必回家。在户外多愉快啊。因此她想搭上公共汽车。正当她站在那里，身穿裁剪非常合身的衣裳的时候，一切已经开始……人们开始将她喻为杨树、拂晓、风信子、小鹿、活水、以及园圃中的百合。这让她的生活蒙受负担，因为她只想独自留在乡下做她喜欢的事，但人们总将她喻为百合，她只得去参加聚会。同在乡下与父亲和狗独处相比，伦敦枯燥极了。","And Elizabeth waited in Victoria Street for an omnibus.It was so nice to be out of doors.She thought perhaps she need not go home just yet.It was so nice to be out in the air.So she would get on to an omnibus.And already, even as she stood there, in her very well cut clothes, it was beginning....People were beginning to compare her to poplar trees, early dawn, hyacinths, fawns, running water, and garden lilies; and it made her life a burden to her, for she so much preferred being left alone to do what she liked in the country, but they would compare her to lilies, and she had to go to parties, and London was so dreary compared with being alone in the country with her father and the dogs."
"公共汽车疾驰过来，停住，离开了——一辆辆鲜艳的车，闪烁着红色和黄色的亮光漆。但她究竟搭哪辆啊？她对哪辆都没有偏好。当然，她不愿让自己去挤。她倾向于顺其自然。她需要的是表情。不过她的双眸很美，中国风格，东方型的，并且就像她母亲说的那样，她长着好看的双肩，出落得袅袅婷婷，看着永远很迷人。最近，尤其在晚上，由于她仿佛从不激动，在她有兴致时，她看起来几乎很美，十分端庄，十分恬静。她可能在思考什么?每个男人都爱着她，可她真的烦透了。因为这是开始。她母亲觉察到这点——人们开始恭维她的女儿。而女儿对这个并不怎么关心——例如不在乎她的衣着——有时候让克拉丽莎担忧，但可能所有那些自负的年轻人与勇于挑战的人在身边吵吵闹闹也不错，增添了她的魅力。如今又与基尔曼小姐有了这种怪异的友谊。那也好，这说明女儿是有感情的，克拉丽莎凌晨三点时在寻思，由于她睡不着觉，所以读着马尔博男爵的书。","Buses swooped, settled, were off—garish caravans, glistening with red and yellow varnish.But which should she get on to?She had no preferences.Of course, she would not push her way.She inclined to be passive.It was expression she needed, but her eyes were fine, Chinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such nice shoulders and holding herself so straight, she was always charming to look at; and lately, in the evening especially, when she was interested, for she never seemed excited, she looked almost beautiful, very stately, very serene.What could she be thinking?Every man fell in love with her, and she was really awfully bored.For it was beginning.Her mother could see that—the compliments were beginning.That she did not care more about it—for instance for her clothes—sometimes worried Clarissa, but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper, and it gave her a charm.And now there was this odd friendship with Miss Kilman.Well, thought Clarissa about three o’clock in the morning, reading Baron Marbot for she could not sleep, it proves she has a heart."
"伊丽莎白猛地往前迈了一步，在众人面前十分麻利地上了公共汽车。她在顶层找了一个座位。那辆风风火火的东西——如一条海盗船——突然启动，向前开去。她只好握住栏杆使自己平稳。这辆车真是一条海盗船，鲁莽又肆无忌惮，无情地压倒一切，危险地拐弯，冒失地抓上来一位乘客或者忽视另一位乘客，如鳗鱼一样骄傲地在车水马龙中穿梭，尔后鼓起所有风帆傲慢无礼地沿怀特霍尔街奔驰。而伊丽莎白是否有点想起毫不妒忌地爱着她的可怜的基尔曼小姐？对基尔曼小姐而言，她是旷野中的幼鹿，是林中空地的一轮明月。她对能摆脱基尔曼小姐感到高兴。清新的空气多么甘美啊。陆海军商店中多么憋闷啊。现在这样沿着怀特霍尔街奔驰就像骑马一样。伴随公共汽车每一个动作，那穿着淡黄褐色外衣的漂亮身子如骑手一样起伏自如，或如船头雕像，因为微风稍稍吹乱了她的衣衫，炎热带给她白漆木一样苍白的脸色，而她美丽的双眸，由于没有目光与之对视，就向前凝视，一片空白、明亮，有雕塑一般凝视着的不可思议的天真。","Suddenly Elizabeth stepped forward and most competently boarded the omnibus, in front of everybody.She took a seat on top.The impetuous creature—a pirate—started forward, sprang away; she had to hold the rail to steady herself, for a pirate it was, reckless, unscrupulous, bearing down ruthlessly, circumventing dangerously, boldly snatching a passenger, or ignoring a passenger, squeezing eel-like and arrogant in between, and then rushing insolently all sails spread up Whitehall.And did Elizabeth give one thought to poor Miss Kilman who loved her without jealousy, to whom she had been a fawn in the open, a moon in a glade?She was delighted to be free.The fresh air was so delicious.It had been so stuffy in the Army and Navy Stores.And now it was like riding, to be rushing up Whitehall; and to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the fawn-coloured coat responded freely like a rider, like the figure-head of a ship, for the breeze slightly disarrayed her; the heat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood; and her fine eyes, having no eyes to meet, gazed ahead, blank, bright, with the staring incredible innocence of sculpture."
"是基尔曼小姐老说到自己的苦难让她很不好相处。她讲得正确吗？要是加入一些委员会，每日花费好多个小时（她在伦敦几乎从没见过他）去救济穷困的人，她父亲就是干这个得，上帝知道，是否那即是基尔曼小姐所谓的一个基督徒的意思，可要说清楚很不容易。哦，她想乘得远一点。到斯特兰德大街还需一便士吗？那这是一便士。她就是要到斯特兰德大街去。","It was always talking about her own sufferings that made Miss Kilman so difficult.And was she right?If it was being on committees and giving up hours and hours every day (she hardly ever saw him in London) that helped the poor, her father did that, goodness knows,—if that was what Miss Kilman meant about being a Christian; but it was so difficult to say.Oh, she would like to go a little further.Another penny was it to the Strand?Here was another penny then.She would go up the Strand."
"她喜欢看到病人。每一份职业对你这一代女人都敞开着，基尔曼小姐说道。所以她可能当名医生。她可能当个农民。牲畜常患病。她可能持有上千英亩地，而且会管辖一些雇工。她会去他们的屋舍探望。车到了萨默塞特大楼。你可能成为一名非常出色的农民——说来也怪，虽然基尔曼小姐对此有影响，可那差不多纯粹是由于萨默塞特大楼的缘故。它看起来那么辉煌，那么庄重，那是一栋高大的灰色大楼。而且她喜欢感觉到人们在工作。她喜欢那些教堂，它们像灰纸剪成的轮廓，面对着斯特兰德大街的车水马龙。这个地方与威斯敏斯特差别迥异，她想着，在钱塞里巷下了车。这地方那么严肃，那么忙碌。总之，她想要一份工作。她愿做一名医生，一个农民，可能去当议员，只要她觉得必要就会去，这全是由于斯特兰德大街的缘故。","She liked people who were ill.And every profession is open to the women of your generation, said Miss Kilman.So she might be a doctor.She might be a farmer.Animals are often ill.She might own a thousand acres and have people under her.She would go and see them in their cottages.This was Somerset House.One might be a very good farmer—and that, strangely enough though Miss Kilman had her share in it, was almost entirely due to Somerset House.It looked so splendid, so serious, that great grey building.And she liked the feeling of people working.She liked those churches, like shapes of grey paper, breasting the stream of the Strand.It was quite different here from Westminster, she thought, getting off at Chancery Lane.It was so serious; it was so busy.In short, she would like to have a profession.She would become a doctor, a farmer, possibly go into Parliament, if she found it necessary, all because of the Strand."
"街上那些人为各自的事务忙碌奔走，人们用手堆砌石块，占据着头脑的并非没完没了毫无意义的唠叨（将女人喻为杨树——这当人颇使人兴奋，可是愚蠢极了），却是对船、生意、法律、管理的思考。全都是那么严肃（她在寺院中）、愉快（这里有河）、虔敬（这里有教堂），这些令她下定了决心，无论她的母亲说什么，她要么当个农民，要么当名医生。可是，她当然相当懒惰。","The feet of those people busy about their activities, hands putting stone to stone, minds eternally occupied not with trivial chatterings (comparing women to poplars—which was rather exciting, of course, but very silly), but with thoughts of ships, of business, of law, of administration, and with it all so stately (she was in the Temple), gay (there was the river), pious (there was the Church), made her quite determined, whatever her mother might say, to become either a farmer or a doctor.But she was, of course, rather lazy."
"最好对此不提一个字。听起来那么蠢。这就是那种有时会的确会发生的事情，当一个人独处的时候——没有建筑工程师名字的大楼，从城里回家的一群群人，他们拥有的力量胜过肯辛顿的一名教士，胜过基尔曼小姐借给她的任何书，能激发沉睡在心灵深处的沙河床上的不成熟、怕见人的东西，让它冲出表面，好像一个小孩忽然伸出胳臂。或许仅仅一声叹息、手臂的一伸、一阵冲动、一个启示却产生永久性的效果，尔后又沉到沙河床底。她得回家了。她得为宴会穿好礼服。可此刻几点钟了？哪里有个钟啊？","And it was much better to say nothing about it.It seemed so silly.It was the sort of thing that did sometimes happen, when one was alone—buildings without architects’ names, crowds of people coming back from the city having more power than single clergymen in Kensington, than any of the books Miss Kilman had lent her, to stimulate what lay slumbrous, clumsy, and shy on the mind’s sandy floor to break surface, as a child suddenly stretches its arms; it was just that, perhaps, a sigh, a stretch of the arms, an impulse, a revelation, which has its effects for ever, and then down again it went to the sandy floor.She must go home.She must dress for dinner.But what was the time?—where was a clock?"
"她往舰队街抬头一望。她朝圣保罗大教堂仅仅走了几步，羞答答的，仿佛踮着脚窥视，在一栋生疏的屋里秉烛夜探，提心吊胆唯恐主人猛然推开卧室门问她来干什么。她不敢拐进古怪的胡同和诱人的小街道，就像在生疏的房子里她不敢推开门，那些也许是卧室门，或是起居室门，或是直通往食品储藏室的门。因为达洛维家没有谁每天都来到斯特兰德大街。她是一个先锋，一个迷途者，充满冒险精神和信任。","She looked up Fleet Street.She walked just a little way towards St. Paul’s, shyly, like some one penetrating on tiptoe, exploring a strange house by night with a candle, on edge lest the owner should suddenly fling wide his bedroom door and ask her business, nor did she dare wander off into queer alleys, tempting bye-streets, any more than in a strange house open doors which might be bedroom doors, or sitting-room doors, or lead straight to the larder.For no Dalloways came down the Strand daily; she was a pioneer, a stray, venturing, trusting."
"在很多方面，她母亲都觉得她的女儿极端幼稚，仍然像个小孩一样，爱玩具娃娃，爱穿旧拖鞋，简直是一个婴儿，而这使她富有魅力。但另一方面，当然，达洛维家有为公众服务的传统。在女性成员中，有修道院院长，大学校长，中学校长，达官显贵——其中没有一个才能出众，但都有上述作为。伊丽莎白又朝向圣保罗教堂走了几步。她喜欢此处喧闹中蕴含的温暖，姐妹情、母爱、兄弟情。她感到这非常好。喧哗声振聋发聩，忽然响起了刺耳的喇叭声（是失业的人们），在一片喧闹中响个不停。军乐奏响，似乎人们在行军。但倘若他们正在死去——倘若某个女人断了气，她方才在屋里实现了至高无上的神圣之举，任何看护她的人如果推开那屋子的窗户，俯瞰舰队街，那喧哗，那军乐将会凯旋办冲向他，安慰他，态度冷淡。","In many ways, her mother felt, she was extremely immature, like a child still, attached to dolls, to old slippers; a perfect baby; and that was charming.But then, of course, there was in the Dalloway family the tradition of public service.Abbesses, principals, head mistresses, dignitaries, in the republic of women—without being brilliant, any of them, they were that.She penetrated a little further in the direction of St. Paul’s.She liked the geniality, sisterhood, motherhood, brotherhood of this uproar.It seemed to her good.The noise was tremendous; and suddenly there were trumpets (the unemployed) blaring, rattling about in the uproar; military music; as if people were marching; yet had they been dying—had some woman breathed her last and whoever was watching, opening the window of the room where she had just brought off that act of supreme dignity, looked down on Fleet Street, that uproar, that military music would have come triumphing up to him, consolatory, indifferent."
"这是无意识的。这里没有对运气或命运的承认。正是因为如此，甚至对那些因注视着垂死者面容上最后有意识的颤动而变得茫然的人们来说，也是宽慰的。人的健忘也许会伤害别人，他们的忘恩负义也许会造成腐蚀。可这声音，无穷尽地宣泄着，一年又一年，将会带走任何可能的东西。这份誓言、这辆货车、这种生活、这个队伍。喧嚣声会囊裹一切，将他们席卷而去，正如在汹涌的冰川流中有块冰包裹着一小片骨头、一片蓝色花瓣、几棵橡树，将它们席卷而下。","It was not conscious.There was no recognition in it of one fortune, or fate, and for that very reason even to those dazed with watching for the last shivers of consciousness on the faces of the dying, consoling.Forgetfulness in people might wound, their ingratitude corrode, but this voice, pouring endlessly, year in year out, would take whatever it might be; this vow; this van; this life; this procession, would wrap them all about and carry them on, as in the rough stream of a glacier the ice holds a splinter of bone, a blue petal, some oak trees, and rolls them on."
"可是天色不早了，比她想得还要晚一些。她的母亲不愿意让她这样独自晃荡。她从斯特兰德大街折回了。","But it was later than she thought.Her mother would not like her to be wandering off alone like this.She turned back down the Strand."
"一阵风（尽管天气炎热，风仍然不小）吹来了一片薄薄的云，遮掩了太阳，飘在斯特兰德大街上方。行人的面孔模糊了，公共汽车忽然间光芒尽失。虽然白白的云层好似群峦，你可以幻想用短柄小斧砍掉块块坚硬的小片，两侧绵延着宽广的金色山坡，天国乐园里的草地，宛若居住在天穹之上的众神集合在一起开会，它们之间有一种永恒的移动。互相交换着种种迹象，似乎履行某个事先安排好的计划。一会儿山峰变小了，一会儿金字塔般大小原本静止不动的大块白云飘至一团云彩中间，或者庄重地统帅片片行云到另一处安身之所。虽然云彩似乎在自己的位置上坚定不移，在极度的和谐中休息，没有什么比这白雪似的或闪着金色光芒的外表更清新、更自由、表面上更敏感；变幻，移动，遣散肃穆的聚会者，一切都是立即可能做到的事。虽然白云庄严固定，堆积得坚实有力，它们却时而透出一束光照耀大地，时而把大地笼在黑暗之中。","A puff of wind (in spite of the heat, there was quite a wind) blew a thin black veil over the sun and over the Strand.The faces faded; the omnibuses suddenly lost their glow.For although the clouds were of mountainous white so that one could fancy hacking hard chips off with a hatchet, with broad golden slopes, lawns of celestial pleasure gardens, on their flanks, and had all the appearance of settled habitations assembled for the conference of gods above the world, there was a perpetual movement among them.Signs were interchanged, when, as if to fulfil some scheme arranged already, now a summit dwindled, now a whole block of pyramidal size which had kept its station inalterably advanced into the midst or gravely led the procession to fresh anchorage.Fixed though they seemed at their posts, at rest in perfect unanimity, nothing could be fresher, freer, more sensitive superficially than the snow-white or gold-kindled surface; to change, to go, to dismantle the solemn assemblage was immediately possible; and in spite of the grave fixity, the accumulated robustness and solidity, now they struck light to the earth, now darkness."
"伊丽莎白·达洛维冷静而麻利地搭上了驶向威斯敏斯特的公共汽车。","Calmly and competently, Elizabeth Dalloway mounted the Westminster omnibus."
"塞普蒂默斯·沃伦·史密斯在客厅的沙发上平躺着，注视着那淡淡的金光在墙纸的玫瑰花上忽明忽暗，像是某种有生命的东西具备令人吃惊的细腻。他感到那一会儿把墙变成了灰色，一会儿把香蕉变成了鲜黄色，一会儿把滨河大道变成灰色，一会儿把公共汽车变成鲜黄色的光和影忽隐忽现，在向他招手、示意。户外，那些树拽着一张张网一般的叶子蔓延到空中很远的地方。屋里可以听到流水的声音。在一阵阵波浪声中传来了小鸟的鸣唱。每种力量都把自己的珍宝倾斜到他头上，他把手搁在沙发靠背上，恰如他游泳时见到自己的手在浪尖浮动，听见遥远岸上的狗叫声，叫声很远。别再畏惧，他体内的心说道，别再畏惧。","Going and coming, beckoning, signalling, so the light and shadow which now made the wall grey, now the bananas bright yellow, now made the Strand grey, now made the omnibuses bright yellow, seemed to Septimus Warren Smith lying on the sofa in the sitting-room; watching the watery gold glow and fade with the astonishing sensibility of some live creature on the roses, on the wall-paper.Outside the trees dragged their leaves like nets through the depths of the air; the sound of water was in the room and through the waves came the voices of birds singing.Every power poured its treasures on his head, and his hand lay there on the back of the sofa, as he had seen his hand lie when he was bathing, floating, on the top of the waves, while far away on shore he heard dogs barking and barking far away.Fear no more, says the heart in the body; fear no more."
"他不畏惧。时时刻刻大自然都笑着以某种暗示——如那个在墙壁上四处闪耀的金色光斑，在那里、那里、那里——向他表明了要表现她意思的决心。她借由舞动她的羽饰，抖动她的长发，甩动她的斗篷，姿态优美，总是姿态优美，同时站在离他非常近的地方，从空握着的双手间喃喃说出莎士比亚的名句。","He was not afraid.At every moment Nature signified by some laughing hint like that gold spot which went round the wall—there, there, there—her determination to show, by brandishing her plumes, shaking her tresses, flinging her mantle this way and that, beautifully, always beautifully, and standing close up to breathe through her hollowed hands Shakespeare’s words, her meaning."
"雷齐娅坐在桌边，手里扭着一顶帽子，她凝视着他，见他在笑。那时他觉得幸福。但她不能忍受见到他笑的样子。这并非婚姻。做丈夫的不应看上去那样奇怪，老是一下惊起，一下狂笑，接连数小时地静坐，要么就揪住她，叫她写点什么。桌子抽屉中放满了这些写下的东西，关于战争、关于莎士比亚、关于伟大的发现以及死亡并不存在的问题。最近他无缘无故一下子就变得兴奋起来（霍姆斯医生与威廉·布拉德肖爵士俩都说兴奋对他来说是最糟糕的），还舞动双手大喊他明白真理了！他明白一切！他说那个男人——他那牺牲了的朋友，埃文斯——来了。他正在屏风背后歌唱。在他说的时候，她都记了下来。有的东西讲得非常美，还有些简直是废话。他老是说到一半就停下来，变了想法，意图添点东西，听见什么新的声响，扬起手聆听着。","Rezia, sitting at the table twisting a hat in her hands, watched him; saw him smiling.He was happy then.But she could not bear to see him smiling.It was not marriage; it was not being one’s husband to look strange like that, always to be starting, laughing, sitting hour after hour silent, or clutching her and telling her to write.The table drawer was full of those writings; about war; about Shakespeare; about great discoveries; how there is no death.Lately he had become excited suddenly for no reason (and both Dr. Holmes and Sir William Bradshaw said excitement was the worst thing for him), and waved his hands and cried out that he knew the truth!He knew everything!That man, his friend who was killed, Evans, had come, he said.He was singing behind the screen.She wrote it down just as he spoke it.Some things were very beautiful; others sheer nonsense.And he was always stopping in the middle, changing his mind; wanting to add something; hearing something new; listening with his hand up."
"但她什么都没听到。","But she heard nothing."
"一次，他们发现那清洁房间的女仆在一阵阵笑声中念着那些纸张中的一页。真是一件极其遗憾的事。因为那使塞普蒂默斯大呼人类的残忍——他们是如何将彼此扯成碎片。他们把倒地者撕碎，他说道。“霍姆斯就在害我们。”他会这样说，他还会杜撰霍姆斯的事迹。霍姆斯在喝粥，霍姆斯在读莎士比亚的书——让自己哄堂大笑或大发脾气，因为霍姆斯医生仿佛象征了令他恐惧的东西。“人性。”他这样称呼他。另外还有一些幻觉。他常说他溺死了，在悬崖边躺着，头上的海鸥发出刺耳的叫声。他会在沙发的边缘向下望去，说是看到了海。要么就说他听见了音乐声。实际上仅仅是手摇风琴的声音，或是街上什么人在大声喊叫。他却常嚷嚷“动听极了”，泪水顺着他的脸颊淌下。这对她而言是最糟糕的事，眼看着塞普蒂默斯，这样一个勇敢的、经历过战争的男人哭泣。他会一直躺在那里听着，直到他突然大喊道他掉下去了，掉到了火焰中！她真的会去寻找火焰，他讲得太逼真了。但什么都没有。屋里只有他俩。她会告诉他这是梦，最终让他平静了，可有时她也感到恐惧。她坐那里，一边缝纫一边叹息。","And once they found the girl who did the room reading one of these papers in fits of laughter.It was a dreadful pity.For that made Septimus cry out about human cruelty—how they tear each other to pieces.The fallen, he said, they tear to pieces.“Holmes is on us,” he would say, and he would invent stories about Holmes; Holmes eating porridge; Holmes reading Shakespeare—making himself roar with laughter or rage, for Dr. Holmes seemed to stand for something horrible to him.“Human nature,” he called him.Then there were the visions.He was drowned, he used to say, and lying on a cliff with the gulls screaming over him.He would look over the edge of the sofa down into the sea.Or he was hearing music.Really it was only a barrel organ or some man crying in the street.But “Lovely!” he used to cry, and the tears would run down his cheeks, which was to her the most dreadful thing of all, to see a man like Septimus, who had fought, who was brave, crying.And he would lie listening until suddenly he would cry that he was falling down, down into the flames!Actually she would look for flames, it was so vivid.But there was nothing.They were alone in the room.It was a dream, she would tell him and so quiet him at last, but sometimes she was frightened too.She sighed as she sat sewing."
"她的叹息是温柔的、迷人的，就像傍晚树林边的风。她不时搁下手中的剪刀，不时转过身在桌上拿点东西。她稍稍动一动，弄出一点沙拉的声响，一点轻拍声，就在那边她缝纫的桌上做出些什么东西了。他从眼睫毛中能窥见她模糊的轮廓，她裹着黑衣的娇小身子，她的脸蛋和双手，她在桌边转身的动作，如拣起一个线轴或找（她老是丢三落四）她的丝绸。她正为菲尔默夫人已婚的女儿做一顶帽子，她女儿的姓名是——他记不得那名字了。","Her sigh was tender and enchanting, like the wind outside a wood in the evening.Now she put down her scissors; now she turned to take something from the table.A little stir, a little crinkling, a little tapping built up something on the table there, where she sat sewing.Through his eyelashes he could see her blurred outline; her little black body; her face and hands; her turning movements at the table, as she took up a reel, or looked (she was apt to lose things) for her silk.She was making a hat for Mrs. Filmer’s married daughter, whose name was—he had forgotten her name."
"“菲尔默夫人已婚的女儿的名字是什么？”他问。","“What is the name of Mrs. Filmer’s married daughter?” he asked."
"“彼得斯夫人。”雷齐娅说道。她担心这帽子太小，她说着，一边把它举在自己面前看。彼得斯夫人是个高大的女人，可雷齐娅并不喜欢她。为她做帽子只是由于菲尔默夫人一向待他们很好。“今天早晨她送了我葡萄。”她说道，雷齐娅想做些事表达他们的感激。前几天的一个晚上，雷齐娅进屋来发现彼得斯夫人在播放唱机，她以为他们出去了。","“Mrs. Peters,” said Rezia.She was afraid it was too small, she said, holding it before her.Mrs. Peters was a big woman; but she did not like her.It was only because Mrs. Filmer had been so good to them.“She gave me grapes this morning,” she said—that Rezia wanted to do something to show that they were grateful.She had come into the room the other evening and found Mrs. Peters, who thought they were out, playing the gramophone."
"“难道这是真的？”他问。她是在播放唱机吗？不错，她在那时就对他讲过，她看到彼得斯夫人在播放唱机。","“Was it true?” he asked.She was playing the gramophone?Yes; she had told him about it at the time; she had found Mrs. Peters playing the gramophone."
"他开始很谨慎地睁开双眼，瞧瞧是否那里真有一台唱机。不过真实的东西——真实的东西叫人过于兴奋了。他必须谨慎。他不想变疯狂。起初他注视着架子下面一层的时装广告，接着慢慢注意到了配有绿色喇叭的唱机。没有什么能比这更真切的了。所以他鼓足勇气，瞧着餐柜，一盘香蕉，维多利亚女皇及其丈夫的雕版画，瞧着壁炉架和上面放着的一瓶玫瑰花。这一切东西都没移动。一切都静止不动，一切都是真的。","He began, very cautiously, to open his eyes, to see whether a gramophone was really there.But real things—real things were too exciting.He must be cautious.He would not go mad.First he looked at the fashion papers on the lower shelf, then, gradually at the gramophone with the green trumpet.Nothing could be more exact.And so, gathering courage, he looked at the sideboard; the plate of bananas; the engraving of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort; at the mantelpiece, with the jar of roses.None of these things moved.All were still; all were real."
"“她是一个口舌恶毒的女人。”雷齐娅说道。","“She is a woman with a spiteful tongue,” said Rezia."
"“彼得斯先生是干什么的？”塞普蒂默斯问道。","“What does Mr. Peters do?” Septimus asked."
"“啊。”雷齐娅说着，一边试图回忆。她想起菲尔默夫人讲过她女婿是某个公司的推销员。“现在他在赫尔。”她说。","“Ah,” said Rezia, trying to remember.She thought Mrs. Filmer had said that he travelled for some company.“Just now he is in Hull,” she said."
"“现在吗！”她用意大利口音说出这个词来。她是亲口讲出的。他遮住双眼以使他每次就只看见她脸的一小部分，先是下颌，接着是鼻子，然后是额头，以防这脸变了形或是留下什么可怖的斑痕。不过并非如此，她就在那里，极其自然地缝着帽子，像别的女人那样在缝纫时撅起嘴，一副忧郁的神色。可没有丝毫可怖，他一次又一次地看她的脸，她的双手，使自己放下心来，她只是大白天里坐着缝制，有什么吓人或令人厌恶的啊？彼得斯夫人口舌恶毒。彼得斯先生到赫尔去了。那么他为何动怒或预言啊？为何自寻痛苦、被人遗弃？为何见到云层就发抖呜咽？为何追求真理，传播启示？而雷齐娅正坐着将针插进她裙子的前襟，彼得斯先生还在赫尔。那些奇迹、启示、悲痛、寂寞，跌进海里，下沉，下沉到火焰里，全都烧光了，因为在他看着雷齐娅给彼得斯夫人装饰草帽时，他感到那是鲜花的床罩。","“Just now!”She said that with her Italian accent.She said that herself.He shaded his eyes so that he might see only a little of her face at a time, first the chin, then the nose, then the forehead, in case it were deformed, or had some terrible mark on it.But no, there she was, perfectly natural, sewing, with the pursed lips that women have, the set, the melancholy expression, when sewing.But there was nothing terrible about it, he assured himself, looking a second time, a third time at her face, her hands, for what was frightening or disgusting in her as she sat there in broad daylight, sewing?Mrs. Peters had a spiteful tongue.Mr. Peters was in Hull.Why then rage and prophesy?Why fly scourged and outcast?Why be made to tremble and sob by the clouds?Why seek truths and deliver messages when Rezia sat sticking pins into the front of her dress, and Mr. Peters was in Hull?Miracles, revelations, agonies, loneliness, falling through the sea, down, down into the flames, all were burnt out, for he had a sense, as he watched Rezia trimming the straw hat for Mrs. Peters, of a coverlet of flowers."
"“对彼得斯夫人来说，这帽子太小了。”塞普蒂默斯说道。","“It’s too small for Mrs. Peters,” said Septimus."
"好几天来他是第一回像往常那样讲话！它当然是——小得荒谬，她答道。但彼得斯夫人选了它。","For the first time for days he was speaking as he used to do!Of course it was—absurdly small, she said.But Mrs. Peters had chosen it."
"他把帽子从她的手中拿过来。他说道它是街头手风琴师耍的猴子的帽子。","He took it out of her hands.He said it was an organ grinder’s monkey’s hat."
"她听了多高兴啊！他俩几周没在一起笑成这样了，如已婚夫妇般私下里寻开心。她的意思是假如菲尔默夫人进来了，或彼得斯夫人或无论谁进来了，他们都不会懂得她和塞普蒂默斯在笑什么。","How it rejoiced her that!Not for weeks had they laughed like this together, poking fun privately like married people.What she meant was that if Mrs. Filmer had come in, or Mrs. Peters or anybody they would not have understood what she and Septimus were laughing at."
"“瞧那里。”她说着，插了一支玫瑰在帽子边。她从未觉得如此幸福！她一生中从未有过！","“There,” she said, pinning a rose to one side of the hat.Never had she felt so happy!Never in her life!"
"不过那还愈发荒谬了，塞普蒂默斯说道。那个可怜的女人戴上了就会像集市上的一头猪。（没人会像塞普蒂默斯一样使她大笑。）","But that was still more ridiculous, Septimus said.Now the poor woman looked like a pig at a fair.(Nobody ever made her laugh as Septimus did.)"
"她在针线盒中放了什么东西呢？她放了丝带和小珠子、流苏、人造花。她将这些都倒在桌上。他开始将色彩怪异的玩意儿放在一起——因为虽然他没有灵巧的手指，甚至连个小包也不会扎，却有个好眼力，并且他往往是正确的，当然有时也会很荒唐，不过有时是惊人地正确。","What had she got in her work-box?She had ribbons and beads, tassels, artificial flowers.She tumbled them out on the table.He began putting odd colours together—for though he had no fingers, could not even do up a parcel, he had a wonderful eye, and often he was right, sometimes absurd, of course, but sometimes wonderfully right."
"“她会戴上好看的帽子啦！”他嘀咕着，挑这捡那的，雷齐娅在他身旁跪着，从他肩上看过去。现在做好了——更确切地说是式样设计好了，她必须缝起来。不过她得十分、十分谨慎，他说道，要按他做的式样来缝。","“She shall have a beautiful hat!” he murmured, taking up this and that, Rezia kneeling by his side, looking over his shoulder.Now it was finished—that is to say the design; she must stitch it together.But she must be very, very careful, he said, to keep it just as he had made it."
"她就这样缝了。他想她缝纫时发出的声音就像炉盘上的壶，冒着气泡，发出噗噗声。她一直在忙，那小而有力的尖尖手指又捏又戳，手中的针闪闪发光。太阳时隐时现，洒在流苏上，洒在墙纸上。可他会等会儿，他想，他的脚伸开去，注视着沙发一端的环纹短袜。他会在这温暖的地方，这空气不流通的口袋似的地方等着。有时你在傍晚在树林边缘会遇到这种情况，由于地面向下倾斜，或者树的某种排列（人最重要的是有科学性，科学性），使得暖暖的空气逗留片刻，微风恰似鸟翼轻拂脸颊。","So she sewed.When she sewed, he thought, she made a sound like a kettle on the hob; bubbling, murmuring, always busy, her strong little pointed fingers pinching and poking; her needle flashing straight.The sun might go in and out, on the tassels, on the wall-paper, but he would wait, he thought, stretching out his feet, looking at his ringed sock at the end of the sofa; he would wait in this warm place, this pocket of still air, which one comes on at the edge of a wood sometimes in the evening, when, because of a fall in the ground, or some arrangement of the trees (one must be scientific above all, scientific), warmth lingers, and the air buffets the cheek like the wing of a bird."
"“做好了。”雷齐娅说着，在指尖上旋转彼得斯夫人的帽子。“姑且就那样吧。以后嘛……”她的话像没有关上的水龙头，心满意足地滴答、滴答、滴答。","“There it is,” said Rezia, twirling Mrs. Peters’ hat on the tips of her fingers.“That’ll do for the moment.Later...” her sentence bubbled away drip, drip, drip, like a contented tap left running."
"美妙极了。他还从来没有做过这样让自己得意的事情呢。如此真切，如此实在，彼得斯夫人的帽子。","It was wonderful.Never had he done anything which made him feel so proud.It was so real, it was so substantial, Mrs. Peters’ hat."
"“瞧一眼吧。”他说道。","“Just look at it,” he said."
"不错，一见到那帽子，她就会开心。这时他已变回自己了，他笑了。他俩单独在一起了。她将一直喜爱那个帽子。","Yes, it would always make her happy to see that hat.He had become himself then, he had laughed then.They had been alone together.Always she would like that hat."
"他让她试戴一下。","He told her to try it on."
"“但我戴上去肯定看起来很怪！”她大声说道，匆匆跑到镜子面前瞅瞅这、瞅瞅那。随后她又突然取下帽子，因为传来一阵敲门声。是不是威廉·布拉德肖爵士？他已来请他们了吗？","“But I must look so queer!” she cried, running over to the glass and looking first this side then that.Then she snatched it off again, for there was a tap at the door.Could it be Sir William Bradshaw?Had he sent already?"
"不！只是那送晚报的小女孩。","No! it was only the small girl with the evening paper."
"无一例外发生的事情这时发生了——每晚都在他们生活中发生的事。那小女孩在门口吮着拇指，雷齐娅屈膝跪下，她温柔地说着话并吻了这孩子，她还从桌子抽屉中掏出来一袋糖果。天天发生这样的事。首先是一桩事，又来另一桩。她就是如此建造起来，先做一桩，又做另一桩。她们跳啊，蹦啊，在屋里转圈圈。他拿起了报纸。他读道萨里全力以赴。出现一股热浪。雷齐娅跟着念：萨里全力以赴。出现一股热浪，她使这消息成了她和菲尔默夫人孙女玩耍的一部分，她俩又说又笑地玩着。他十分疲惫了。他又十分高兴。他想睡觉。他合上双眼。可是他一看不到东西，她俩玩游戏的声响就变弱了，变奇怪了，听着犹如人们寻觅什么又没找到时的呼喊声，那声响渐行渐远。她俩找不到他了！","What always happened, then happened—what happened every night of their lives.The small girl sucked her thumb at the door; Rezia went down on her knees; Rezia cooed and kissed; Rezia got a bag of sweets out of the table drawer.For so it always happened.First one thing, then another.So she built it up, first one thing and then another.Dancing, skipping, round and round the room they went.He took the paper.Surrey was all out, he read.There was a heat wave.Rezia repeated: Surrey was all out.There was a heat wave, making it part of the game she was playing with Mrs. Filmer’s grandchild, both of them laughing, chattering at the same time, at their game.He was very tired.He was very happy.He would sleep.He shut his eyes.But directly he saw nothing the sounds of the game became fainter and stranger and sounded like the cries of people seeking and not finding, and passing further and further away.They had lost him!"
"他在恐惧中惊起。他看到了什么？餐柜上放着一盘香蕉。屋里没人（雷齐娅带着那孩子回她妈妈那里了。就寝时间到了）。就是如此：永远孤独。这就是在米兰已经注定了的命运。当他走进那个房间，发现她们用剪刀剪硬麻布帽型时，就注定了要永远孤独。","He started up in terror.What did he see?The plate of bananas on the sideboard.Nobody was there (Rezia had taken the child to its mother.It was bedtime).That was it: to be alone forever.That was the doom pronounced in Milan when he came into the room and saw them cutting out buckram shapes with their scissors; to be alone forever."
"他与餐柜和香蕉单独在一起。他一个人暴露在这荒凉的高处，伸直四肢——可并不在山顶，不在峭壁上，而是在菲尔默夫人客厅的沙发上。至于那些幻觉，那些死者的面孔和声音又在哪里？他眼前有个屏风，上面是黑色的芦苇和蓝色的燕子。他以前在那个地方看到过山脉，看到过人脸，看到过美丽，现在却只是一道屏风。","He was alone with the sideboard and the bananas.He was alone, exposed on this bleak eminence, stretched out—but not on a hill-top; not on a crag; on Mrs. Filmer’s sitting-room sofa.As for the visions, the faces, the voices of the dead, where were they?There was a screen in front of him, with black bulrushes and blue swallows.Where he had once seen mountains, where he had seen faces, where he had seen beauty, there was a screen."
"“埃文斯啊！”他大喊道。没有回答。有只老鼠发出吱吱声，或许是帷幕沙沙作响。那些是死者发出的声音。屏风、煤斗、餐柜仍与他作伴。让他面对那屏风、煤斗和餐柜……可雷齐娅喋喋不休地闯了进来。","“Evans!” he cried.There was no answer.A mouse had squeaked, or a curtain rustled.Those were the voices of the dead.The screen, the coalscuttle, the sideboard remained to him.Let him then face the screen, the coal-scuttle and the sideboard... but Rezia burst into the room chattering."
"有封信到了。每个人的计划都发生了变化。菲尔默夫人终究还是不能到布赖顿去。没工夫告知威廉斯夫人了，雷齐娅认为这真的十分、十分恼人。此时她一下子就看到那帽子，心想……也许……她……可以小小的……她那美妙的、心满意足的声音渐渐消失不见了。","Some letter had come.Everybody’s plans were changed.Mrs. Filmer would not be able to go to Brighton after all.There was no time to let Mrs. Williams know, and really Rezia thought it very, very annoying, when she caught sight of the hat and thought... perhaps... she... might just make a little....Her voice died out in contented melody."
"“呃，该死的！”她大喊（她说粗话是他俩之间的一种玩笑），针折了。帽子、小孩、布赖顿、针。她逐步建造起来，先做一桩，又做另一桩，她逐步建造起来，缝着。","“Ah, damn!” she cried (it was a joke of theirs, her swearing), the needle had broken.Hat, child, Brighton, needle.She built it up; first one thing, then another, she built it up, sewing."
"她想听他讲一下是否挪一下玫瑰花的位置就可以使帽子更好看些。她坐在沙发的一端。","She wanted him to say whether by moving the rose she had improved the hat.She sat on the end of the sofa."
"此刻他们非常幸福，她说着，忽然就放下帽子。因为她现在可以对他说任何事情。脑子里想到什么就能说什么。那差不多是她对他初次的感觉，那天晚上他和他的英国朋友走进咖啡馆。他走进来，很害羞，环顾四周，他挂帽子的时候却掉到了地上。她还记得那情形。她清楚他是个英国人，尽管并非她的姊妹倾佩的那种高大的英国人，因为他老是很瘦削。不过他气色非常好，还有一个大鼻子，一双明眸，坐的时候习惯性地向前倾，令她想起一头幼鹰，她常对他这样说。她第一次见到他的那个晚上，那时他们在玩多米诺牌，他就进来了——如一头幼鹰。可他待她向来很温存。她从来没有看见过他发狂或醉酒，仅仅因为经历了这场恐怖的战争而有时感到痛苦，可虽然这样，在她进来之后，他会把痛苦放在一边。她会给他说任何事，整个世界上的任何事，任何工作上的一点小烦恼，任何她想说的事都对他说，而他马上就会懂。甚至她自己的家人也不如他。他大她几岁，还那么机灵——他多严肃啊，竟想让她读莎士比亚的剧本，那时她甚至还读不懂英文的儿童故事！他的经验也更丰富，能帮助她。而她也能帮他。","They were perfectly happy now, she said, suddenly, putting the hat down.For she could say anything to him now.She could say whatever came into her head.That was almost the first thing she had felt about him, that night in the cafe when he had come in with his English friends.He had come in, rather shyly, looking round him, and his hat had fallen when he hung it up.That she could remember.She knew he was English, though not one of the large Englishmen her sister admired, for he was always thin; but he had a beautiful fresh colour; and with his big nose, his bright eyes, his way of sitting a little hunched made her think, she had often told him, of a young hawk, that first evening she saw him, when they were playing dominoes, and he had come in—of a young hawk; but with her he was always very gentle.She had never seen him wild or drunk, only suffering sometimes through this terrible war, but even so, when she came in, he would put it all away.Anything, anything in the whole world, any little bother with her work, anything that struck her to say she would tell him, and he understood at once.Her own family even were not the same.Being older than she was and being so clever—how serious he was, wanting her to read Shakespeare before she could even read a child’s story in English!—being so much more experienced, he could help her.And she too could help him."
"不过现在说说这帽子。接着（天色渐晚）就要谈到威廉·布拉德肖爵士了。","But this hat now.And then (it was getting late) Sir William Bradshaw."
"她把双手放在头上，等他说是否喜欢这帽子。当她坐在那里等着，眼睛向下看的时候，他能感受她的思绪，像一只鸟在树枝间跳跃，总是能停落得非常稳当。她自然地摆出一种散漫轻松的姿势坐在那里时，他可以跟上她的思绪，如果他说点什么，她会马上露出微笑，如一只小鸟落在枝头，爪子牢牢地抓住树枝。","She held her hands to her head, waiting for him to say did he like the hat or not, and as she sat there, waiting, looking down, he could feel her mind, like a bird, falling from branch to branch, and always alighting, quite rightly; he could follow her mind, as she sat there in one of those loose lax poses that came to her naturally and, if he should say anything, at once she smiled, like a bird alighting with all its claws firm upon the bough."
"不过他记得布拉德肖曾经说过：“我们最爱的人在我们患病时对我们没有益处。”布拉德肖说得教他如何休息。还说他俩一定要分开。","But he remembered Bradshaw said, “The people we are most fond of are not good for us when we are ill.”Bradshaw said, he must be taught to rest.Bradshaw said they must be separated."
"“一定”，“一定”，为什么“一定”呢？布拉德肖有什么权力命令他呢？“布拉德肖凭什么权力叫我‘一定’？”他诘问道。","“Must,” “must,” why “must”?What power had Bradshaw over him?“What right has Bradshaw to say ‘must’ to me?” he demanded."
"“由于你说过要自杀。”雷齐娅说道。（不幸中的万幸，她如今能对塞普蒂默斯说任何事了。）","“It is because you talked of killing yourself,” said Rezia.(Mercifully, she could now say anything to Septimus.)"
"那么他处在他们控制之下了！霍姆斯与布拉德肖跟他干上了！那个鼻孔红红的畜生把鼻子伸到了每一个私密的地方！它竟敢说“一定”！他的稿子在哪里？他写的东西在哪里？","So he was in their power!Holmes and Bradshaw were on him!The brute with the red nostrils was snuffing into every secret place!“Must” it could say!Where were his papers?the things he had written?"
"她拿来了他的稿子，他写的东西，她替他写的那些东西。她把那些稿子往沙发上一扔。他俩一起看着。有图表、设计图、矮小的男女舞动着棍子当武器，背后还长着翅膀——是翅膀吗？绕着一先令和六便士的钱币画的圈——那是太阳与星星。蜿蜒曲折的绝壁，简直就像许许多多刀叉，上面有用绳子系在一起的登山者向上攀爬。有的上面画着一片片海，小小的、笑着的人脸浮在也许代表波浪的画面上。还有一幅世界地图。烧了它们！他嚷道。再看看他的稿子吧。死者怎样在杜鹃花丛后咏唱，时光的颂歌，同莎士比亚交谈，埃文斯、埃文斯、埃文斯——来自死者的讯息，别砍伐树木，告知首相。博爱：世间的意义。烧了它们！他嚷道。","She brought him his papers, the things he had written, things she had written for him.She tumbled them out on to the sofa.They looked at them together.Diagrams, designs, little men and women brandishing sticks for arms, with wings—were they?—on their backs; circles traced round shillings and sixpences—the suns and stars; zigzagging precipices with mountaineers ascending roped together, exactly like knives and forks; sea pieces with little faces laughing out of what might perhaps be waves: the map of the world.Burn them! he cried.Now for his writings; how the dead sing behind rhododendron bushes; odes to Time; conversations with Shakespeare; Evans, Evans, Evans—his messages from the dead; do not cut down trees; tell the Prime Minister.Universal love: the meaning of the world.Burn them! he cried."
"可是雷齐娅把手压在稿子上。有些很美，她认为。她会用一根丝线将它们扎好（由于她没信封）。","But Rezia laid her hands on them.Some were very beautiful, she thought.She would tie them up (for she had no envelope) with a piece of silk."
"纵然他们带走他，她说道，她也会跟他一起走。他们不能违背他俩的意愿分开他俩，她说道。","Even if they took him, she said, she would go with him.They could not separate them against their wills, she said."
"她把纸边对齐，把文稿整理好，几乎没看一眼就系好了包裹，挨着他坐着。他觉得似乎她身上的所有花瓣都开了。她是一株鲜花盛开的树，从她的树枝间透出一位立法者的面孔，她已经来到圣殿，在那里，她不畏惧任何人，不畏惧霍姆斯，不畏惧布拉德肖。这是一个奇迹、一个胜利，是最后的、也是最伟大的胜利。他注视着她蹒跚地登上那可怕的楼梯，背着霍姆斯与布拉德肖，这两个男人的体重都从未在一百六十磅之下。他俩把妻子送到法庭去。他们一年收入一万英镑却大谈什么平衡。他俩的判断不一样（因为霍姆斯说这回事，布拉德肖却说另一回事），但他俩都是审判官。他俩搞混了幻象与餐柜，什么也看不清楚，但还做出裁决、处以惩罚。他俩说“一定”。她把他俩征服了。","Shuffling the edges straight, she did up the papers, and tied the parcel almost without looking, sitting beside him, he thought, as if all her petals were about her.She was a flowering tree; and through her branches looked out the face of a lawgiver, who had reached a sanctuary where she feared no one; not Holmes; not Bradshaw; a miracle, a triumph, the last and greatest.Staggering he saw her mount the appalling staircase, laden with Holmes and Bradshaw, men who never weighed less than eleven stone six, who sent their wives to Court, men who made ten thousand a year and talked of proportion; who different in their verdicts (for Holmes said one thing, Bradshaw another), yet judges they were; who mixed the vision and the sideboard; saw nothing clear, yet ruled, yet inflicted.“Must” they said.Over them she triumphed."
"“好了！”她说道。文稿都扎好了。谁也别想得到它们。她会将它们收起来。","“There!” she said.The papers were tied up.No one should get at them.She would put them away."
"并且，她说道，没有什么能分开他们。她坐在他身边，并称他为鹰或者乌鸦，因为它们很坏，毁坏庄稼，跟他像极了。没人能分开他们，她说道。","And, she said, nothing should separate them.She sat down beside him and called him by the name of that hawk or crow which being malicious and a great destroyer of crops was precisely like him.No one could separate them, she said."
"于是她站起来走进卧室去整理东西，但听到楼下有声音，她寻思可能是霍姆斯医生来访了，就奔下去阻止他上楼。","Then she got up to go into the bedroom to pack their things, but hearing voices downstairs and thinking that Dr. Holmes had perhaps called, ran down to prevent him coming up."
"塞普蒂默斯可以听到她与霍姆斯在楼梯上谈话。","Septimus could hear her talking to Holmes on the staircase."
"“亲爱的太太，我是以一个朋友的身份来访的。”霍姆斯说着。","“My dear lady, I have come as a friend,” Holmes was saying."
"“不，我是不会让你见我丈夫的。”她说道。","“No. I will not allow you to see my husband,” she said."
"他可以想象她的模样，像一只小母鸡，张开翅膀，阻拦他的去路。可霍姆斯仍然坚持。","He could see her, like a little hen, with her wings spread barring his passage.But Holmes persevered."
"“亲爱的太太，就让我……”霍姆斯说着，一把推开她（霍姆斯是一个体魄强健的男人）。","“My dear lady, allow me...”Holmes said, putting her aside (Holmes was a powerfully built man)."
"霍姆斯正在上楼。霍姆斯将猛然打开门。霍姆斯会说：“害怕了吧，嗯？”霍姆斯将抓住他。但是不，不能让霍姆斯、不能让布拉德肖抓住他。他晃晃悠悠地站起来，实在是单脚轮换着往前跳，思量着菲尔默夫人那把刀柄上刻有“面包”字样的——切面包用的精致干净的刀。啊，不能糟践了那把刀。点着煤气？可是现在太晚了。霍姆斯来啦。他也许有刀片，但是雷齐娅已经都收拾起来了，她总是这样做。唯一可用的是窗户，布卢姆斯伯里的公寓的大窗，然后就是推开窗跳下楼，真是件令人生厌、苦恼、颇有戏剧性的事。这就是他们所认为的悲剧，而非他或雷齐娅的（因为她是赞成他的）。霍姆斯与布拉德肖喜欢那种事。他在窗台上坐着。不过他会等着，直到最后关头。他并不想死去。生活是美好的。太阳是热的。只是人类——他们要的是什么呢？一个从对面楼梯走下来的老头停下来盯着他。霍姆斯在门口。“我拿给你吧！”他大叫着，然后用力蓦地一跳，狠狠地摔到菲尔默夫人宅子的栏杆上。","Holmes was coming upstairs.Holmes would burst open the door.Holmes would say “In a funk, eh?”Holmes would get him.But no; not Holmes; not Bradshaw.Getting up rather unsteadily, hopping indeed from foot to foot, he considered Mrs. Filmer’s nice clean bread knife with “Bread” carved on the handle.Ah, but one mustn’t spoil that.The gas fire?But it was too late now.Holmes was coming.Razors he might have got, but Rezia, who always did that sort of thing, had packed them.There remained only the window, the large Bloomsbury-lodging house window, the tiresome, the troublesome, and rather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing himself out.It was their idea of tragedy, not his or Rezia’s (for she was with him).Holmes and Bradshaw like that sort of thing.(He sat on the sill.) But he would wait till the very last moment.He did not want to die.Life was good.The sun hot.Only human beings—what did THEY want?Coming down the staircase opposite an old man stopped and stared at him.Holmes was at the door.“I’ll give it you!” he cried, and flung himself vigorously, violently down on to Mrs. Filmer’s area railings."
"“胆小鬼！”霍姆斯医生大叫着，猛地打开门。雷齐娅向窗户奔去，她看到了，她了解了。霍姆斯医生与菲尔默夫人撞到了一起。菲尔默夫人舞动着她的围裙，叫雷齐娅去卧室把眼睛遮住。很多人在楼梯上跑上跑下。霍姆斯医生进来了——面如白纸，全身颤抖，手中拿着一只玻璃杯。她一定得勇敢，得喝点什么，他说道（是什么呢？甜的东西），因为她的丈夫摔得很严重，不会恢复知觉了。她断不能去见他，得尽量减轻她的痛苦。她还要经受审讯，不幸的年轻女人。这谁能预料啊？一时冲动，怪不得任何人（他告诉菲尔默夫人）。那他到底为何要这样做，霍姆斯医生无法想象。","“The coward!” cried Dr. Holmes, bursting the door open.Rezia ran to the window, she saw; she understood.Dr. Holmes and Mrs. Filmer collided with each other.Mrs. Filmer flapped her apron and made her hide her eyes in the bedroom.There was a great deal of running up and down stairs.Dr. Holmes came in—white as a sheet, shaking all over, with a glass in his hand.She must be brave and drink something, he said (What was it?Something sweet), for her husband was horribly mangled, would not recover consciousness, she must not see him, must be spared as much as possible, would have the inquest to go through, poor young woman.Who could have foretold it?A sudden impulse, no one was in the least to blame (he told Mrs. Filmer).And why the devil he did it, Dr. Holmes could not conceive."
"雷齐娅喝下那甜甜的东西时，感到好像自己在推开落地窗，走进了某个花园。钟声敲响了——一下、两下、三下：与这一切的砰砰声和低语声相比，钟声是多么理智啊，就像塞普蒂默斯本人。然而钟持续地敲着，四下、五下、六下，菲尔默夫人挥舞着她的围裙（他们不会将遗体搬来这里吧，是吗？）像是花园的一个部分，要么就像一面旗帜。她有一回见到一面旗帜在旗杆上徐徐荡漾开去，当时她呆在威尼斯的姑妈那里。就是以这种方式向战死在战争中的人致敬，而塞普蒂默斯经历过那场战争。她的记忆中大都是快乐的。","It seemed to her as she drank the sweet stuff that she was opening long windows, stepping out into some garden.But where?The clock was striking—one, two, three: how sensible the sound was; compared with all this thumping and whispering; like Septimus himself.She was falling asleep.But the clock went on striking, four, five, six and Mrs. Filmer waving her apron (they wouldn’t bring the body in here, would they?) seemed part of that garden; or a flag.She had once seen a flag slowly rippling out from a mast when she stayed with her aunt at Venice.Men killed in battle were thus saluted, and Septimus had been through the War.Of her memories, most were happy."
"她戴上帽子，在玉米地里奔跑——这能是哪里呢？——爬上某个小山丘，靠近海的某个地方，因为那里有船舶、海鸥、蝴蝶。他们坐在一个峭壁上。在伦敦，他们也是那样坐着，半梦半醒，经卧室的门传来雨声、耳语声、干玉米杆摇动的窸窣声。她仿佛觉得这是海的抚摸，似乎把他们裹在浪涛弓形的壳中，对躺在岸上的她喃喃低语，她觉得自己被撒开了，像散落在某个坟上的、飞舞的花朵。","She put on her hat, and ran through cornfields—where could it have been?—on to some hill, somewhere near the sea, for there were ships, gulls, butterflies; they sat on a cliff.In London too, there they sat, and, half dreaming, came to her through the bedroom door, rain falling, whisperings, stirrings among dry corn, the caress of the sea, as it seemed to her, hollowing them in its arched shell and murmuring to her laid on shore, strewn she felt, like flying flowers over some tomb."
"“他死了。”她说道，对着那守护她的、可怜的老妇人微笑，那个老妇人用一双可靠的淡蓝色眼睛紧盯着房门。（他们不会将他搬到这里，会吗？）可是菲尔默夫人认为这个想法很可笑。啊，不会的！啊，不会的！他们现在就抬走他。难道不应该跟她讲吗？夫妇就该呆在一起，菲尔默夫人心想。但他们一定得照医生的话做。","“He is dead,” she said, smiling at the poor old woman who guarded her with her honest light-blue eyes fixed on the door.(They wouldn’t bring him in here, would they?) But Mrs. Filmer pooh-poohed.Oh no, oh no!They were carrying him away now.Ought she not to be told?Married people ought to be together, Mrs. Filmer thought.But they must do as the doctor said."
"“就让她睡吧。”霍姆斯医生说，一边给她把脉。她看见他靠窗站着的、高大的轮廓。原来那是霍姆斯医生。","“Let her sleep,” said Dr. Holmes, feeling her pulse.She saw the large outline of his body standing dark against the window.So that was Dr. Holmes."
"这是文明的一大胜利，彼得·沃尔什心想。这是文明的一大胜利，这时救护车刺耳的铃声响了起来。救护车在人道地立即搭上某个可怜的家伙后，迅速而麻利地驶向医院。什么人被打伤了头，病倒了，一两分钟前在十字路口被车撞倒，自己可能也会碰上这种事。这即是文明。从东方归来之后，令他印象深刻的是——伦敦的效率、机构、为公众服务的精神。每辆运货车或四轮马车都主动驶向一边给救护车让行。也许人们对这辆救护车以及里面的患者表现出的尊重有些病态。但是这难道不令人感动吗？救护车驶过时，那些着急回家的、忙碌的男人却马上想起了妻子，或者想到自己也极有可能就是那车里一位医生和一位护士守护下的、躺在担架上的人……啊，只要一想起医生啊、尸体啊，思绪就会变得病态、多愁善感。这类幻像又会带来一点快乐的光芒，一种欲望，警醒人们别再想诸如此类的事了——这对艺术、对友谊都关系重大。千真万确。可是当救护车转过街角，沿着下一条街行驶，在更远的地方穿过托特纳姆考特路时，仍然可以听到那清脆刺耳的铃声不断地响着。此刻彼得·沃尔什心想，这就是孤独的特权，独自一人时可以做自己想做的事。想哭就可以哭，如果没人看见的话。他的这种敏感使他在印度的英国人圈子中一事无成。不会适时哭，也不会适时笑。我天生就是这样，他站在邮筒边想，现在就能感动得泪流满面。为何呢？天晓得。大概是有种美感，或是一整天的负荷，从对克拉丽莎的访问开始，弄得他他疲惫不堪。炎热，紧张，一个又一个的印象一滴一滴流入那深邃黑暗的心底，汇集起来，永远不会有人知道。部分是由于那完整而不可侵犯的秘密，他发现生活如一个生疏的花园，到处是转弯拐角，的确令人惊讶。有的时候真的让人十分惊讶。他站在大英博物馆对面的邮筒旁边时就感受到了这样的一刻，此时，万物都聚拢来，这辆救护车，生生死死。好像他被奔泻的情感吸到某处极高的屋顶，而他剩下的躯壳像撒落着贝壳的一片白皑皑的海滩，没有遮掩。这是他在印度的英国人社交圈中失败的原因——如此敏感。","One of the triumphs of civilisation, Peter Walsh thought.It is one of the triumphs of civilisation, as the light high bell of the ambulance sounded.Swiftly, cleanly the ambulance sped to the hospital, having picked up instantly, humanely, some poor devil; some one hit on the head, struck down by disease, knocked over perhaps a minute or so ago at one of these crossings, as might happen to oneself.That was civilisation.It struck him coming back from the East—the efficiency, the organisation, the communal spirit of London.Every cart or carriage of its own accord drew aside to let the ambulance pass.Perhaps it was morbid; or was it not touching rather, the respect which they showed this ambulance with its victim inside—busy men hurrying home yet instantly bethinking them as it passed of some wife; or presumably how easily it might have been them there, stretched on a shelf with a doctor and a nurse....Ah, but thinking became morbid, sentimental, directly one began conjuring up doctors, dead bodies; a little glow of pleasure, a sort of lust too over the visual impression warned one not to go on with that sort of thing any more—fatal to art, fatal to friendship.True.And yet, thought Peter Walsh, as the ambulance turned the corner though the light high bell could be heard down the next street and still farther as it crossed the Tottenham Court Road, chiming constantly, it is the privilege of loneliness; in privacy one may do as one chooses.One might weep if no one saw.It had been his undoing—this susceptibility—in Anglo-Indian society; not weeping at the right time, or laughing either.I have that in me, he thought standing by the pillar-box, which could now dissolve in tears.Why, Heaven knows.Beauty of some sort probably, and the weight of the day, which beginning with that visit to Clarissa had exhausted him with its heat, its intensity, and the drip, drip, of one impression after another down into that cellar where they stood, deep, dark, and no one would ever know.Partly for that reason, its secrecy, complete and inviolable, he had found life like an unknown garden, full of turns and corners, surprising, yes; really it took one’s breath away, these moments; there coming to him by the pillar-box opposite the British Museum one of them, a moment, in which things came together; this ambulance; and life and death.It was as if he were sucked up to some very high roof by that rush of emotion and the rest of him, like a white shell-sprinkled beach, left bare.It had been his undoing in Anglo-Indian society—this susceptibility."
"克拉丽莎有一回跟他在某处搭上了公共汽车的顶层。那些日子里她很容易激动，起码表面是这样，时而绝望，时而情绪高涨，激动得浑身发抖，是一个很有趣的伴侣。她会从公共汽车顶层望去，发现奇怪的小景物、名字、人，因为他们过去常在伦敦览胜，从苏格兰市场带回装得满满的一袋袋稀罕什物——克拉丽莎那些日子有个理论——他们和其他年轻人一样有成堆的理论，满嘴理论。那是为了抒发他们不满的情绪，不了解别人，也不被人了解。因为人们怎么才能相互了解呢？你和某人每天见面，尔后分开六个月，或是几年。他们一致同意，人与人之间了解得太少了，真是让人不满意。不过她乘着公共汽车驶向沙夫茨伯里大街时，却说她觉得处处都有自己的身影。并非“这里、这里、这里”，她拍了拍座位的椅背，而是处处皆是。她挥着手，驶向沙夫茨伯里大街。她就是那样的人。所以要懂得她或任何人，就得找出使他们臻于完美的人，甚至是一些场所。她跟从来没交谈过的人有很奇怪的亲和力，如街头一个女人，柜台后某个男人——甚至是树木，或仓房。　最后归结为先验论，由于她惧怕死亡，这个理论允许她相信或者她自己相信（虽然她是个怀疑论者），既然我们的灵魂，即表现出的部分和不可见的其他部分相比瞬间即逝，而不可见的部分广阔地存在于天地间，因此可以永远存在，可以通过用某种方式依附在这个人或那个人身上而重生，甚至是死了以后仍然阴魂不散在一些地方……可能吧——可能吧。","Clarissa once, going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere, Clarissa superficially at least, so easily moved, now in despair, now in the best of spirits, all aquiver in those days and such good company, spotting queer little scenes, names, people from the top of a bus, for they used to explore London and bring back bags full of treasures from the Caledonian market—Clarissa had a theory in those days—they had heaps of theories, always theories, as young people have.It was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction; not knowing people; not being known.For how could they know each other?You met every day; then not for six months, or years.It was unsatisfactory, they agreed, how little one knew people.But she said, sitting on the bus going up Shaftesbury Avenue, she felt herself everywhere; not “here, here, here”; and she tapped the back of the seat; but everywhere.She waved her hand, going up Shaftesbury Avenue.She was all that.So that to know her, or any one, one must seek out the people who completed them; even the places.Odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken to, some woman in the street, some man behind a counter—even trees, or barns.It ended in a transcendental theory which, with her horror of death, allowed her to believe, or say that she believed (for all her scepticism), that since our apparitions, the part of us which appears, are so momentary compared with the other, the unseen part of us, which spreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached to this person or that, or even haunting certain places after death... perhaps—perhaps."
"回眸这长达三十年之久的友谊，他觉得她的理论在这个程度上是行得通的。尽管他俩实际的会面是短暂的、断断续续的、常常是痛苦的，因为他经常不在，有时还被人打扰（比方说，今天早晨，他正要开口与克拉丽莎说话，伊丽莎白就进来了，犹如一匹长腿的马驹，俊美、沉静），但是这些会面给他生活带来的影响不可计量。它有种神秘性。实际的会面像是你获得一颗有棱角、尖尖的、让人不舒服的谷粒，多半是痛苦的。但是在见不到它的时候，在沉寂了很多年之后，它却在最不可能的地方长出花蕾、开放、散发芳香，任你触摸、品尝、环视周围以得到对它整体的感受和理解。如此她来到了他的心上，经常是最古怪的事情使他想起了她。或者在船上，或者在喜马拉雅山上（萨莉·西顿，那个大方、热心的傻姑娘在看到蓝色的绣球花时也是这样想起了他）。她对他的影响超过了他认识的任何一个人。还老这样在他意想不到时就到了他跟前，冷酷、挑剔、淑女；或者令人陶醉，充满浪漫气息，唤起人们对田野或是英国收获时节的记忆。他最常是在乡下与她会面，而非伦敦。一幕又一幕在伯顿的景象啊……","Looking back over that long friendship of almost thirty years her theory worked to this extent.Brief, broken, often painful as their actual meetings had been what with his absences and interruptions (this morning, for instance, in came Elizabeth, like a long-legged colt, handsome, dumb, just as he was beginning to talk to Clarissa) the effect of them on his life was immeasurable.There was a mystery about it.You were given a sharp, acute, uncomfortable grain—the actual meeting; horribly painful as often as not; yet in absence, in the most unlikely places, it would flower out, open, shed its scent, let you touch, taste, look about you, get the whole feel of it and understanding, after years of lying lost.Thus she had come to him; on board ship; in the Himalayas; suggested by the oddest things (so Sally Seton, generous, enthusiastic goose! thought of HIM when she saw blue hydrangeas).She had influenced him more than any person he had ever known.And always in this way coming before him without his wishing it, cool, lady-like, critical; or ravishing, romantic, recalling some field or English harvest.He saw her most often in the country, not in London.One scene after another at Bourton...."
"他到了自己住的宾馆。他穿过了门厅，门厅里摆着一大堆淡红色椅子及沙发，还有叶子尖尖、有枯萎模样的植物。他把钥匙从钩上取下来。年轻的侍女交给他一些信件。他上楼了——他经常在伯顿与她会面，在夏季之末，他在那里呆一个星期，甚至两个星期，那时候人们总是那样做。最初她站在那里的某个山顶，双手抚着发丝，她的斗篷迎风飘扬，指着什么地方向他们嚷道——她瞧见山下的塞汶河啦。要么是在林中，把壶中水煮沸——她的手指很不灵活；炊烟袅绕，吹拂着他们的脸；她那张小巧粉红的脸隐现在烟气中；两人向村舍里的老妇人讨水来喝，老人还到门边看着他们离开。两人向来走路，其他人都驾车。她厌倦了驾车，讨厌一切动物，除了那只狗。两人沿途跋涉了好多英里路。她会突然停止下来辨明方向，带着他穿过乡间往回走。一路上两人都在争论，讨论诗、讨论人、讨论政治（她当时是个激进分子）。她从来都没注意到任何东西，除非她止步时，才对着一处景物或一棵树大叫，还让他一起看，随后又向前走，越过留茬地。她带头走着，拿着一朵给她姑妈的花。她虽然柔弱，可从不厌烦走路。黄昏时分，他们返回了伯顿。之后，晚餐之后，老布赖特科普夫掀开钢琴毫无音调地唱起歌来。而他们会沉入扶手椅中，想忍住不笑，但老忍不住，于是就笑出来，不停地笑着——无端大笑。布赖特科普夫本不应该看见的。到了早上时，她在房前像只鹡鸰鸟一样跳上跳下、打情骂俏……","He had reached his hotel.He crossed the hall, with its mounds of reddish chairs and sofas, its spike-leaved, withered-looking plants.He got his key off the hook.The young lady handed him some letters.He went upstairs—he saw her most often at Bourton, in the late summer, when he stayed there for a week, or fortnight even, as people did in those days.First on top of some hill there she would stand, hands clapped to her hair, her cloak blowing out, pointing, crying to them—she saw the Severn beneath.Or in a wood, making the kettle boil—very ineffective with her fingers; the smoke curtseying, blowing in their faces; her little pink face showing through; begging water from an old woman in a cottage, who came to the door to watch them go.They walked always; the others drove.She was bored driving, disliked all animals, except that dog.They tramped miles along roads.She would break off to get her bearings, pilot him back across country; and all the time they argued, discussed poetry, discussed people, discussed politics (she was a Radical then); never noticing a thing except when she stopped, cried out at a view or a tree, and made him look with her; and so on again, through stubble fields, she walking ahead, with a flower for her aunt, never tired of walking for all her delicacy; to drop down on Bourton in the dusk.Then, after dinner, old Breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any voice, and they would lie sunk in arm-chairs, trying not to laugh, but always breaking down and laughing, laughing—laughing at nothing.Breitkopf was supposed not to see.And then in the morning, flirting up and down like a wagtail in front of the house...."
"哦，这是她的来信！是个蓝色信封，是她的字迹。他必须得看这封信。又是一回这样的见面，注定是痛苦的！看她的来信必须得费好大的劲。“与他见面多么愉快啊。她一定会告诉他这个。”信上就这些话。","Oh it was a letter from her!This blue envelope; that was her hand.And he would have to read it.Here was another of those meetings, bound to be painful!To read her letter needed the devil of an effort.“How heavenly it was to see him.She must tell him that.”That was all."
"但这封信让他不高兴。使他恼怒。他宁愿她没写过这封信。在他满怀思绪时收到了这封信，好比肋骨被人推了一下。为何她不能不打扰他呢？说到底，她已和达洛维结婚了，并且这么多年来与他过得十分幸福。","But it upset him.It annoyed him.He wished she hadn’t written it.Coming on top of his thoughts, it was like a nudge in the ribs.Why couldn’t she let him be?After all, she had married Dalloway, and lived with him in perfect happiness all these years."
"这些宾馆并非使人慰藉之地。远非如此。不知道有多少旅客在那些帽挂上挂过帽子。你想一想，即使苍蝇也在其他人的鼻子上停留过。至于说让他眼前一亮的清洁，并非清洁，而是赤裸、冷淡，只能是这样。有个死板的女管家会在拂晓时巡查一番，这边闻闻，那边瞅瞅，吩咐鼻子冻得发青的女佣们擦洗东西，好像接下来的一位顾客是一大块肉，要用异常干净的大菜盘来盛放。一张床用来睡觉，一张椅子用来坐，一个大杯子用来刷牙，一面镜子用来刮胡子。而他的书、信、睡袍被乱扔在缺乏人情味的马毛织品上，就如同不协调的鲁莽举动。正是克拉丽莎的信让他看到了这一切。“与你会面很愉快。她必须告诉他这个！”他叠好信纸，丢在一边，什么也无法使他再次读这封信了！","These hotels are not consoling places.Far from it.Any number of people had hung up their hats on those pegs.Even the flies, if you thought of it, had settled on other people’s noses.As for the cleanliness which hit him in the face, it wasn’t cleanliness, so much as bareness, frigidity; a thing that had to be.Some arid matron made her rounds at dawn sniffing, peering, causing blue-nosed maids to scour, for all the world as if the next visitor were a joint of meat to be served on a perfectly clean platter.For sleep, one bed; for sitting in, one armchair; for cleaning one’s teeth and shaving one’s chin, one tumbler, one looking-glass.Books, letters, dressing-gown, slipped about on the impersonality of the horsehair like incongruous impertinences.And it was Clarissa’s letter that made him see all this.“Heavenly to see you.She must say so!”He folded the paper; pushed it away; nothing would induce him to read it again!"
"要使他在六点收到此信，她必定是在他一离去就坐下来写，贴了邮票，叫人去邮局寄信。和人们说的一样，她就是这样的一个人。她因他的来访烦乱不安。她有很多感触，在她亲吻他手的那一刻，感到懊悔，甚至羡慕他，可能想起了（因为他从她的脸色看出来了）他说过的什么——或许要是她嫁给他的话，他俩会如何改造这个世界。但如今竟是这般，人到中年，庸庸碌碌。因此她凭着不服输的活力强迫自己抛开那一切，因为她体内有股生命力，有韧性、耐力、有能力去战胜障碍、使自己成功度过难关，他从未见过这种力量。是的，可他一走出屋子她便会有一种反应。她会为他觉得万分难过。她会考虑自己究竟能做些什么能带给他乐趣（他总是缺少这样东西），他可以想见她脸颊上淌着泪，来到写字桌旁匆匆写下一句话，就是他后来看到的问候他的话……“见到你很高兴！”而她真是这样想的。","To get that letter to him by six o’clock she must have sat down and written it directly he left her; stamped it; sent somebody to the post.It was, as people say, very like her.She was upset by his visit.She had felt a great deal; had for a moment, when she kissed his hand, regretted, envied him even, remembered possibly (for he saw her look it) something he had said—how they would change the world if she married him perhaps; whereas, it was this; it was middle age; it was mediocrity; then forced herself with her indomitable vitality to put all that aside, there being in her a thread of life which for toughness, endurance, power to overcome obstacles, and carry her triumphantly through he had never known the like of.Yes; but there would come a reaction directly he left the room.She would be frightfully sorry for him; she would think what in the world she could do to give him pleasure (short always of the one thing) and he could see her with the tears running down her cheeks going to her writing-table and dashing off that one line which he was to find greeting him....“Heavenly to see you!”And she meant it."
"彼得·沃尔什此刻解开了靴带。","Peter Walsh had now unlaced his boots."
"可是他俩结婚是不会有好结果的。毕竟换成另一个人倒来得更加自然。","But it would not have been a success, their marriage.The other thing, after all, came so much more naturally."
"真是怪，事实如此，很多人都感受到了这点。彼得·沃尔什混得坡为体面，在普通的岗位上游刃有余，惹人喜欢。不过人们觉得他有点怪怪的，好摆架势——真怪，正是他，特别是如今发丝灰白时，竟露出一种惬意的神色、一副矜持的表情。　就是这一点让女人都喜欢她，她们感觉到他并非全是男人气概。他有种独特的气质，或内心有些与众不同。可能是因为他有些书呆子气——他来看望你时从不会忘记拿起桌上的书（他此刻便在读书，靴带拖在地板上），或者说他是位绅士，这呈现于他敲掉烟斗中灰烬时的气派，当然也呈现于他对女士们的风度中。因为没有一点头脑的女子也能那么轻易地将他玩弄于鼓掌，真是十分可爱、十分荒唐。不过那女子也要自担风险。换句话说，虽然他也许很容易亲近，并且凭他生性愉悦与良好的教养，跟他相处是令人陶醉的，可只是点到为止。克拉丽莎说了什么——不对，不对。他识透了。他受不了那样——不，不。他同男人们一起开玩笑，大声喊叫，摇来晃去，捧腹大笑。他是印度最优秀的烹饪鉴定家。他是个男人。不过他并非需要人尊重的那种男人——幸好如此。例如，黛西认为，他不像西蒙斯少校，毫不相像，虽然她已生了两个小孩，还常比较这两个男人。","It was odd; it was true; lots of people felt it.Peter Walsh, who had done just respectably, filled the usual posts adequately, was liked, but thought a little cranky, gave himself airs—it was odd that HE should have had, especially now that his hair was grey, a contented look; a look of having reserves.It was this that made him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not altogether manly.There was something unusual about him, or something behind him.It might be that he was bookish—never came to see you without taking up the book on the table (he was now reading, with his bootlaces trailing on the floor); or that he was a gentleman, which showed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and in his manners of course to women.For it was very charming and quite ridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist him round her finger.But at her own risk.That is to say, though he might be ever so easy, and indeed with his gaiety and good-breeding fascinating to be with, it was only up to a point.She said something—no, no; he saw through that.He wouldn’t stand that—no, no.Then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over some joke with men.He was the best judge of cooking in India.He was a man.But not the sort of man one had to respect—which was a mercy; not like Major Simmons, for instance; not in the least like that, Daisy thought, when, in spite of her two small children, she used to compare them."
"他脱掉靴子。他掏空自己的口袋。随着他的折刀一起掉出来的是黛西在阳台上拍的一张快照。黛西一袭白衣，有只猎狐犬蹲在她膝上，非常黑，可爱极了。这是他见过的她最好看的照片。毕竟一切都显得如此浑然天成，比克拉丽莎自然多了。没有大惊小怪。没有纠缠麻烦。没有过分挑剔和焦躁不安。皆是一帆风顺。阳台上那位可爱标致的黑皮肤女子在惊呼（他可以听见她的声音）。诚然，诚然，她会把一切献给他！她大声说道（她没什么顾虑），他想要什么都行！她大声喊着，向他奔去，迎接他，管他什么人在看。而她仅二十四岁。还生了两个小孩。哎，哎！","He pulled off his boots.He emptied his pockets.Out came with his pocket-knife a snapshot of Daisy on the verandah; Daisy all in white, with a fox-terrier on her knee; very charming, very dark; the best he had ever seen of her.It did come, after all so naturally; so much more naturally than Clarissa.No fuss.No bother.No finicking and fidgeting.All plain sailing.And the dark, adorably pretty girl on the verandah exclaimed (he could hear her).Of course, of course she would give him everything!she cried (she had no sense of discretion) everything he wanted!she cried, running to meet him, whoever might be looking.And she was only twenty-four.And she had two children.Well, well!"
"哎，到了这个年纪，他还让自己陷入这样的麻烦。他晚间梦醒时颇为强烈地闪过一个念头。如果他俩真要结婚的话？对他来说再好不过了，可对她呢？他曾对伯吉斯夫人倾诉心里话，她是个好人，不爱说三道四。这位夫人觉得他回英国表面上是去见律师，但是他离开印度可能会让黛西再斟酌一下，想想跟他结婚意味着什么。伯吉斯夫人说问题在于她的地位，社会风俗的阻碍，还有需要放弃她的小孩。总有一天，她会成为一个有着难言过去的寡妇，在城郊流浪，更为可能的是，行为不检点（你知道的，她说，这种喜欢浓妆艳抹的女人会变成什么样子）。可彼得·沃尔什对这番话一笑置之。他还不想死。无论如何，她得自己做出决定，自己判断，他想着，一边穿着短袜在屋里来回踱步，抚平搭礼服的衬衫，因为他也许会去参加克拉丽莎的聚会，也许会去哪个礼堂，也许呆在家里看以前在牛津的一个熟人写的一本有趣的书。要是他确是要退休，那就是他要做的——写书。他会去牛津，到牛津大学图书馆翻阅资料。那位可爱标致的黑皮肤女孩徒劳地奔向平台尽头，徒劳地挥着手，徒劳地喊道她毫不在意人们的议论。他就在那里——那个她觉得了不起的那个男人，完美的绅士，令人着迷，卓越不凡（而她丝毫不介意他的年纪）——在布卢姆斯伯里一个宾馆的房间里走来走去，剃胡子，洗洗漱漱，拿起水罐，放下刮胡刀，一边继续想到牛津大学图书馆翻阅资料，去寻找吸引他的一两桩琐事的真相。他碰到任何人都会闲聊一番，因此会越来越不遵守午餐的确切时间，错过约会时间。当黛西习惯性地向他索吻，亲热一番时，他表现平平（虽然他真的钟情于她）——简而言之，就像伯吉斯夫人所言，她忘了他可能会快乐些，或是只留下一九二二年八月对他的记忆——傍晚时站在十字路口的一个身影——当时她乘上双轮马车驶去，安全地靠在后面的座位上，尽管她伸开双臂，那影像仍愈来愈远，渐渐变小，消散，她依然大喊道她愿做世上的任何事情、任何事情、任何事情、任何事情……","Well indeed he had got himself into a mess at his age.And it came over him when he woke in the night pretty forcibly.Suppose they did marry?For him it would be all very well, but what about her?Mrs. Burgess, a good sort and no chatterbox, in whom he had confided, thought this absence of his in England, ostensibly to see lawyers might serve to make Daisy reconsider, think what it meant.It was a question of her position, Mrs. Burgess said; the social barrier; giving up her children.She’d be a widow with a past one of these days, draggling about in the suburbs, or more likely, indiscriminate (you know, she said, what such women get like, with too much paint).But Peter Walsh pooh-poohed all that.He didn’t mean to die yet.Anyhow she must settle for herself; judge for herself, he thought, padding about the room in his socks, smoothing out his dress-shirt, for he might go to Clarissa’s party, or he might go to one of the Halls, or he might settle in and read an absorbing book written by a man he used to know at Oxford.And if he did retire, that’s what he’d do—write books.He would go to Oxford and poke about in the Bodleian.Vainly the dark, adorably pretty girl ran to the end of the terrace; vainly waved her hand; vainly cried she didn’t care a straw what people said.There he was, the man she thought the world of, the perfect gentleman, the fascinating, the distinguished (and his age made not the least difference to her), padding about a room in an hotel in Bloomsbury, shaving, washing, continuing, as he took up cans, put down razors, to poke about in the Bodleian, and get at the truth about one or two little matters that interested him.And he would have a chat with whoever it might be, and so come to disregard more and more precise hours for lunch, and miss engagements, and when Daisy asked him, as she would, for a kiss, a scene, fail to come up to the scratch (though he was genuinely devoted to her)—in short it might be happier, as Mrs. Burgess said, that she should forget him, or merely remember him as he was in August 1922, like a figure standing at the cross roads at dusk, which grows more and more remote as the dog-cart spins away, carrying her securely fastened to the back seat, though her arms are outstretched, and as she sees the figure dwindle and disappear still she cries out how she would do anything in the world, anything, anything, anything...."
"他从不清楚人们在想什么。他愈来愈难以专心致志了。他变得一门心思只忙活自己的事情，有时乖戾、有时高兴。他依靠女人，心神恍惚，情绪多变，愈来愈不能（他剃胡须时这样想着）明白为何克拉丽莎不索性为他俩寻个住处，好好对待黛西，把她介绍给朋友。然后他就正好能——就正好能怎样呢？正好四处游荡（那时他实际上忙于整理各种钥匙、纸张），猛地来个突袭，领略一番，独自一人，总之，自我满足。可是自然没人比他更依靠他人了（他扣上了马甲），这是他致命的缺点。他不能置身于吸烟室外，喜欢那些上校，喜欢高尔夫，喜欢桥牌，最重要的是爱和女人扎堆。而她们细腻的友谊、恋爱中的忠贞、大胆、伟大，尽管有缺陷，对他而言（那张皮肤黑黑的、可爱标致的脸的照片出现在一叠信封之上）是那样地统统令人尊敬，是人类生活之巅生长着的一朵绚烂无比的花。可是他表现平平，因为他总是看到实物的真实面貌（克拉丽莎把他体内的精力永远地耗尽了）。他非常容易对缄默的爱感到厌倦，希望爱是千变万化的，尽管倘若黛西爱上其他人会使他狂怒、狂怒！因为他爱妒忌，天生就无法遏制地容易妒忌。他遭受着痛苦！但去哪里找他的刀、手表、图章、钱包，还有他不想再看却爱回想的克拉丽莎的信以及黛西的照片呢？吃饭的时间到了。","He never knew what people thought.It became more and more difficult for him to concentrate.He became absorbed; he became busied with his own concerns; now surly, now gay; dependent on women, absent-minded, moody, less and less able (so he thought as he shaved) to understand why Clarissa couldn’t simply find them a lodging and be nice to Daisy; introduce her.And then he could just—just do what?just haunt and hover (he was at the moment actually engaged in sorting out various keys, papers), swoop and taste, be alone, in short, sufficient to himself; and yet nobody of course was more dependent upon others (he buttoned his waistcoat); it had been his undoing.He could not keep out of smoking-rooms, liked colonels, liked golf, liked bridge, and above all women’s society, and the fineness of their companionship, and their faithfulness and audacity and greatness in loving which though it had its drawbacks seemed to him (and the dark, adorably pretty face was on top of the envelopes) so wholly admirable, so splendid a flower to grow on the crest of human life, and yet he could not come up to the scratch, being always apt to see round things (Clarissa had sapped something in him permanently), and to tire very easily of mute devotion and to want variety in love, though it would make him furious if Daisy loved anybody else, furious!for he was jealous, uncontrollably jealous by temperament.He suffered tortures!But where was his knife; his watch; his seals, his note-case, and Clarissa’s letter which he would not read again but liked to think of, and Daisy’s photograph?And now for dinner."
"人们都在吃。","They were eating."
"人们围坐在摆着花瓶的小桌前，穿着礼服或便装，把他们的围巾和手袋放在一边，做出一种泰然自若的样子，因为他们不习惯于在晚餐时见到如此多道菜。他们信心十足，因为有钱买单。他们疲惫不堪，因为整天都在伦敦跑来跑去买东西啦，游览啦；他们流露出天然的好奇心，因为在一位俊俏的、戴角质架眼镜的绅士走进来时，大伙都转身对他上下端详。这些人性格温厚，因为他们乐意帮任何小忙，比方说借一张时间表或告知有用的信息。他们想用某种方法来建立联系的渴望在内心涌动，在隐隐地牵着他们，即便仅仅是出生地相同（例如，利物浦）或有名字一样的朋友也好。他们鬼鬼祟祟地环视四周，保持怪异的缄默，突然只顾家庭的欢乐，与外界隔离了。沃尔什先生进来了，在帷幔边的一个小桌前坐下，此时他们正坐在那里吃饭。","Sitting at little tables round vases, dressed or not dressed, with their shawls and bags laid beside them, with their air of false composure, for they were not used to so many courses at dinner, and confidence, for they were able to pay for it, and strain, for they had been running about London all day shopping, sightseeing; and their natural curiosity, for they looked round and up as the nice-looking gentleman in horn-rimmed spectacles came in, and their good nature, for they would have been glad to do any little service, such as lend a time-table or impart useful information, and their desire, pulsing in them, tugging at them subterraneously, somehow to establish connections if it were only a birthplace (Liverpool, for example) in common or friends of the same name; with their furtive glances, odd silences, and sudden withdrawals into family jocularity and isolation; there they sat eating dinner when Mr. Walsh came in and took his seat at a little table by the curtain."
"他赢得人们的尊敬，并不是因为他说了什么，因为他是自己一个人来的，只能和服务生说话，而是因为他看菜单的样子，用食指指着某一种酒，靠近餐桌坐的样子，以及吃饭时认真但不贪婪的样子。那种尊重在用餐的多数时间内都未曾表现出来，而当他们听到他在晚餐快要结束时说“巴特利特梨”时，那种尊敬在莫里斯一家人的餐桌上就瞬间爆发了。为何他说得那么温柔而又肯定，一派实施纪律者恰当地执行他建立在公正之上的权力的架势，不管是小查尔斯·莫里斯，还是老莫里斯，不管是伊莱恩小姐还是莫里斯夫人都不明白这一点。可他独自坐在餐桌边说“巴特利特梨”时，他们觉得他希望在某个合法的要求上得到他们的支持。他是拥护某项事业，这事业马上就要成为他们自己的事业了，因此他们同情地看着他的眼睛，当他们都一齐走进吸烟室时，必然就会聊了起来。","It was not that he said anything, for being solitary he could only address himself to the waiter; it was his way of looking at the menu, of pointing his forefinger to a particular wine, of hitching himself up to the table, of addressing himself seriously, not gluttonously to dinner, that won him their respect; which, having to remain unexpressed for the greater part of the meal, flared up at the table where the Morrises sat when Mr. Walsh was heard to say at the end of the meal, “Bartlett pears.”Why he should have spoken so moderately yet firmly, with the air of a disciplinarian well within his rights which are founded upon justice, neither young Charles Morris, nor old Charles, neither Miss Elaine nor Mrs. Morris knew.But when he said, “Bartlett pears,” sitting alone at his table, they felt that he counted on their support in some lawful demand; was champion of a cause which immediately became their own, so that their eyes met his eyes sympathetically, and when they all reached the smoking-room simultaneously, a little talk between them became inevitable."
"聊得不是很深刻——大意不过是伦敦挤得水泄不通，三十年中有了变化，莫里斯先生更喜欢利物浦，莫里斯夫人去过威斯敏斯特花展，以及他们全都看到了威尔士亲王。但是彼得·沃尔什认为，世界上没有哪个家庭能比得上莫里斯一家，无论如何也没有。他们一家人彼此的关系和睦极了，而且对上层社会不屑一顾。他们有自己的爱好，伊莱恩正在为家族企业接受训练，那个男孩已经获得利兹大学的奖学金。而老妇人（大约同他一样的年龄）有三个孩子在家。他们拥有两辆汽车，可莫里斯先生仍然在礼拜天自己修补靴子。真是妙极了，完全妙极了，彼得·沃尔什想着，把酒杯端在手中，在红色绒椅与烟灰盘之间轻轻地来回晃动，对自己感到十分满意，因为莫里斯一家人喜欢他。是的，他们喜欢这个说“巴特利特梨”的男人。他们喜欢他，他感受到了。","It was not very profound—only to the effect that London was crowded; had changed in thirty years; that Mr. Morris preferred Liverpool; that Mrs. Morris had been to the Westminster flower-show, and that they had all seen the Prince of Wales.Yet, thought Peter Walsh, no family in the world can compare with the Morrises; none whatever; and their relations to each other are perfect, and they don’t care a hang for the upper classes, and they like what they like, and Elaine is training for the family business, and the boy has won a scholarship at Leeds, and the old lady (who is about his own age) has three more children at home; and they have two motor cars, but Mr. Morris still mends the boots on Sunday: it is superb, it is absolutely superb, thought Peter Walsh, swaying a little backwards and forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand among the hairy red chairs and ash-trays, feeling very well pleased with himself, for the Morrises liked him.Yes, they liked a man who said, “Bartlett pears.”They liked him, he felt."
"他将去参加克拉丽莎的宴会。（莫里斯一家人离开了，不过他们会再与他会面的。）他将去参加克拉丽莎的宴会，因为他想要问问理查德印度那些家伙——就是那些保守党笨蛋们——在干什么。目前要演什么戏？有什么音乐……哦，是的，仅仅是闲聊。","He would go to Clarissa’s party.(The Morrises moved off; but they would meet again.) He would go to Clarissa’s party, because he wanted to ask Richard what they were doing in India—the conservative duffers. And what’s being acted?And music....Oh yes, and mere gossip."
"他想，因为这就是我们灵魂的真相，我们的自我真相。像栖居深海的鱼类游弋于晦暗中，小心地穿过硕大水草，经过阳光闪烁的海域，不停地向前游去，游去，游进晦暗、寒冷、深邃、神秘的地方。突然间，鱼蹿出海面，在随风皱起的海浪上嬉戏。也就是说，我们的灵魂积极地需要在聊天时得到洗刷、刮擦、点燃激情。政府打算如何处理印度？理查德·达洛维会清楚的。","For this is the truth about our soul, he thought, our self, who fish-like inhabits deep seas and plies among obscurities threading her way between the boles of giant weeds, over sun-flickered spaces and on and on into gloom, cold, deep, inscrutable; suddenly she shoots to the surface and sports on the wind-wrinkled waves; that is, has a positive need to brush, scrape, kindle herself, gossiping.What did the Government mean—Richard Dalloway would know—to do about India?"
"由于那是一个酷热的夜晚，那些报童来回奔走，拿着用特大红字写着热浪袭来的告示牌，宾馆台阶上放着藤椅，悠闲的绅士们坐在那里呷茶、抽烟。彼得·沃尔什也在那里坐着。你可能会想那一天，伦敦的一天才刚刚开始。就如一个女人脱下她的印花裙和白色围裙，用蓝衣服及珍珠饰品来装扮自己，白天有了变化，卸下毛呢，换上薄纱，变成了夜晚，像女人把衬裙丢在地上时那样愉快地叹了口气，也退掉了尘土、热气、颜色。交通减少了，汽车响着车铃疾驰而去，接替了笨重的货车。枝叶茂盛的广场上到处悬挂着非常亮的路灯。夜晚仿佛说，我告辞了，这时它在旅馆、公寓和一排排商店的墙垛、突出部位、圆拱和尖顶上暗淡褪去。它又说，我褪去，我消失，可伦敦不同意，连忙把刺刀刺向空中，束缚住夜晚，迫使它加入狂欢的队伍。","Since it was a very hot night and the paper boys went by with placards proclaiming in huge red letters that there was a heat-wave, wicker chairs were placed on the hotel steps and there, sipping, smoking, detached gentlemen sat.Peter Walsh sat there.One might fancy that day, the London day, was just beginning.Like a woman who had slipped off her print dress and white apron to array herself in blue and pearls, the day changed, put off stuff, took gauze, changed to evening, and with the same sigh of exhilaration that a woman breathes, tumbling petticoats on the floor, it too shed dust, heat, colour; the traffic thinned; motor cars, tinkling, darting, succeeded the lumber of vans; and here and there among the thick foliage of the squares an intense light hung.I resign, the evening seemed to say, as it paled and faded above the battlements and prominences, moulded, pointed, of hotel, flat, and block of shops, I fade, she was beginning, I disappear, but London would have none of it, and rushed her bayonets into the sky, pinioned her, constrained her to partnership in her revelry."
"自彼得·沃尔什上次回国时，英格兰就爆发了威利特先生创设夏令时的伟大革命。对彼得而言延长的夜晚是陌生的。而且还相当令人兴奋。因为青年们携着公文箱经过时，自由自在、异常欢欣，并自豪地默默走在这著名的大街上，一种欢乐使他们红光满面，可能你觉得这是廉价的、华而不实的快乐，但仍然是一种狂喜。他们也好好打扮了一番，穿着粉红长袜，好看的鞋子。他们此刻要在电影院里花上两小时。夜晚的昏黄而泛蓝的光使他们显得轮廓清晰而优雅。广场上树叶火红、青灰——它们看起来似乎在海水里浸过了——一座水下城市的树叶。这番美景令彼得感到惊讶，也鼓舞人心，因为从印度归来的英国人（他认识一大群这类人）凭他们的权利坐在东方俱乐部内，气愤地总结着世界的衰退，可他在这里，依然年轻，妒忌年轻人的夏日光阴及其余的一切，从一位少女的话语、一个女仆的笑中——一些你触摸不到的无形之物——感觉到他年轻时仿佛不可动摇的整个金字塔一般的社会积累已经发生了变化。从前它重重地压在他们身上，压得他们低下了头，尤其是女性，犹如克拉丽莎的姑妈海伦娜的那些花，她晚饭后在灯光下把花夹在灰色的吸墨纸里，上面还放着利特雷的字典。她已经去世了。他从克拉丽莎那里听说，她姑妈有只眼失去了视力。这看来是如此适宜——自然界的一大佳作——老帕里小姐竟戴上了眼镜。她会如霜冻中的某种鸟牢牢抓住栖枝而死。她属于一个不同的时代，可是那么完整、那么完满。她会一直耸立在地平线上，石一样白，挺拔突出，如一座灯塔，标记着这个充满着冒险、无限漫长的旅程中、这个无尽的（他掏出一个铜币去买了份报纸，读有关萨里及约克郡的新闻——他掏出铜币买报已经有千百万回了。萨里又一次全力以赴）——这无尽的生命。可板球不只是个比赛而已。板球很重要。他老是情不自禁地看板球赛新闻。他首先看报纸付印时临时插进的板球赛比分消息，再看有关天气酷热的新闻，接下来看一件谋杀案的消息。千百万回地做一些事情丰富了人们的经验，然而也可以说让人黯然无光。往事充实了人生，体验也使人丰富。由于他喜欢过一两个人，这些使他获得了青年人缺少的能力，即中断事情、随心所欲地做事，完全不在意人们说什么，来去没有任何大的期望（他把报纸留在桌上离开了），然而（他在寻找帽子与外衣）这一点在他身上并不完全如此，今晚并不这样，因为他正要赴宴，在他这岁数，心里却认为自己将还要得到一次体验。可是怎样的体验呢？","For the great revolution of Mr. Willett’s summer time had taken place since Peter Walsh’s last visit to England.The prolonged evening was new to him.It was inspiriting, rather.For as the young people went by with their despatch-boxes, awfully glad to be free, proud too, dumbly, of stepping this famous pavement, joy of a kind, cheap, tinselly, if you like, but all the same rapture, flushed their faces.They dressed well too; pink stockings; pretty shoes.They would now have two hours at the pictures.It sharpened, it refined them, the yellow-blue evening light; and on the leaves in the square shone lurid, livid—they looked as if dipped in sea water—the foliage of a submerged city.He was astonished by the beauty; it was encouraging too, for where the returned Anglo-Indian sat by rights (he knew crowds of them) in the Oriental Club biliously summing up the ruin of the world, here was he, as young as ever; envying young people their summer time and the rest of it, and more than suspecting from the words of a girl, from a housemaid’s laughter—intangible things you couldn’t lay your hands on—that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation which in his youth had seemed immovable.On top of them it had pressed; weighed them down, the women especially, like those flowers Clarissa’s Aunt Helena used to press between sheets of grey blotting-paper with Littre’s dictionary on top, sitting under the lamp after dinner.She was dead now.He had heard of her, from Clarissa, losing the sight of one eye.It seemed so fitting—one of nature’s masterpieces—that old Miss Parry should turn to glass.She would die like some bird in a frost gripping her perch.She belonged to a different age, but being so entire, so complete, would always stand up on the horizon, stone-white, eminent, like a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous, long, long voyage, this interminable (he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire—he had held out that copper millions of times.Surrey was all out once more)—this interminable life.But cricket was no mere game.Cricket was important.He could never help reading about cricket.He read the scores in the stop press first, then how it was a hot day; then about a murder case.Having done things millions of times enriched them, though it might be said to take the surface off.The past enriched, and experience, and having cared for one or two people, and so having acquired the power which the young lack, of cutting short, doing what one likes, not caring a rap what people say and coming and going without any very great expectations (he left his paper on the table and moved off), which however (and he looked for his hat and coat) was not altogether true of him, not tonight, for here he was starting to go to a party, at his age, with the belief upon him that he was about to have an experience.But what?"
"至少是种美。并非眼睛所见的、粗俗的美。并非十足的美——贝德福德大街通向拉塞尔广场。它当然是笔直的、空荡荡的，具有走廊的对称，可是也有灯火闪烁的窗户、钢琴、留声机的音乐声，让你感觉到人们在私底下寻欢作乐，但是有时也会暴露出来，通过没有拉上窗帘的、开着的窗子，你会看到一群群人坐在餐桌边，青年们翩翩起舞，男人女人在攀谈，女佣们懒洋洋地望着窗外（这是她们干完活后一种奇怪的表达），顶层壁架上晾着长袜，一只鹦鹉和少许植物。这生活引人入胜、神秘，又无限丰富。在宽阔的广场上有急驰和突然转弯的出租车，有些闲逛的情侣，打情骂俏、相互拥抱，隐入树的浓阴之下，真是动人的情景，如此静谧，如此投入。人们经过时轻手轻脚，羞答答的，似乎在某个神圣的仪式面前，任何打断都是不虔诚的。这真有意思。就这样往前走，走入了耀眼的灯火中。","Beauty anyhow.Not the crude beauty of the eye.It was not beauty pure and simple—Bedford Place leading into Russell Square.It was straightness and emptiness of course; the symmetry of a corridor; but it was also windows lit up, a piano, a gramophone sounding; a sense of pleasure-making hidden, but now and again emerging when, through the uncurtained window, the window left open, one saw parties sitting over tables, young people slowly circling, conversations between men and women, maids idly looking out (a strange comment theirs, when work was done), stockings drying on top ledges, a parrot, a few plants.Absorbing, mysterious, of infinite richness, this life.And in the large square where the cabs shot and swerved so quick, there were loitering couples, dallying, embracing, shrunk up under the shower of a tree; that was moving; so silent, so absorbed, that one passed, discreetly, timidly, as if in the presence of some sacred ceremony to interrupt which would have been impious.That was interesting.And so on into the flare and glare."
"他的薄外衣被风吹散开了。他走路时有一种独特的姿势。身体稍稍前倾，迈着轻快的步伐，双手交叉在背后，眼神依然有点像鹰。他轻快地走过了伦敦，朝威斯敏斯特走去，一边留心观察着。","His light overcoat blew open, he stepped with indescribable idiosyncrasy, lent a little forward, tripped, with his hands behind his back and his eyes still a little hawklike; he tripped through London, towards Westminster, observing."
"那么每个人都出去吃饭了吗？这里一个男仆打开了门，让一位仪态威严的老夫人走出来，她穿着一双扣紧的鞋，在头发上插了三根紫色鸵鸟羽毛。门开了，出来几位用带着明艳花图案的围巾把自己包得跟木乃伊一样的女士，还有不披头巾的女士。在体面的、柱子粉刷过的住宅前，女人们头发上插着梳子，穿过房前稍微修剪过的小花园，走了过来（她们刚刚跑上楼看过孩子）。男人们在等着她们，他们的外衣被风吹开了，汽车启动了。每个人都要出去。门开了，人们走下来、出发，这看起来好像整个伦敦都乘上了泊在河岸边、在水面上颠簸的小船，好像整座城市在狂欢中泛游水上。怀特霍尔好似蒙上一层蛛网，镀银一般，弧光灯周围有蚊蚋缭绕的感觉，天气太热了，人们只能站着聊天。而在这里威斯敏斯特有个可能是退了休的法官，一袭白衣端正地坐在自家门口。可能是在印度住过的英国人。","Was everybody dining out, then?Doors were being opened here by a footman to let issue a high-stepping old dame, in buckled shoes, with three purple ostrich feathers in her hair.Doors were being opened for ladies wrapped like mummies in shawls with bright flowers on them, ladies with bare heads.And in respectable quarters with stucco pillars through small front gardens lightly swathed with combs in their hair (having run up to see the children), women came; men waited for them, with their coats blowing open, and the motor started.Everybody was going out.What with these doors being opened, and the descent and the start, it seemed as if the whole of London were embarking in little boats moored to the bank, tossing on the waters, as if the whole place were floating off in carnival.And Whitehall was skated over, silver beaten as it was, skated over by spiders, and there was a sense of midges round the arc lamps; it was so hot that people stood about talking.And here in Westminster was a retired Judge, presumably, sitting four square at his house door dressed all in white.An Anglo-Indian presumably."
"这里是一帮闹哄哄的女人、醉酒的女人，那里仅有一名警察和隐现的宅子、高大的房屋、有穹顶的房屋、教堂、议会，河上汽船的汽笛声、空洞模糊的呼喊声。可这是她居住的街道，这条街，克拉丽莎的住处。出租车猛冲过街的拐角，似流水绕过桥墩。他觉得车子都赶到了这里，因为它们都载着赶赴她宴会的人们，克拉丽莎的宴会。","And here a shindy of brawling women, drunken women; here only a policeman and looming houses, high houses, domed houses, churches, parliaments, and the hoot of a steamer on the river, a hollow misty cry.But it was her street, this, Clarissa’s; cabs were rushing round the corner, like water round the piers of a bridge, drawn together, it seemed to him because they bore people going to her party, Clarissa’s party."
"这冰冷的一连串视觉印象此时在他面前模糊了，似乎他的眼是一只已经溢满的杯子，任溢出之水不留痕迹地在其瓷壁上淌下来。现在大家必须清醒过来。身体必须绷紧起来，进入那个房子，那照得通亮的房子，那里门开着，汽车停在那里，光艳的女人们下了车：灵魂必须要去勇敢地面对，去忍受。他打开了折刀里的大刀片。","The cold stream of visual impressions failed him now as if the eye were a cup that overflowed and let the rest run down its china walls unrecorded.The brain must wake now.The body must contract now, entering the house, the lighted house, where the door stood open, where the motor cars were standing, and bright women descending: the soul must brave itself to endure.He opened the big blade of his pocket-knife."
"露西一溜烟奔到楼下，方才快速跑到客厅去抚平了垫子，扶正了椅子，暂停了一会儿，认为不管哪个人进来准会觉得这里很整洁、很亮堂、整理得很美观。他们会瞧见美丽的银器、铜质壁炉用具、崭新的椅垫，以及黄色印花棉布帷幔：她鉴赏着每样东西，听见一阵喧哗声，客人们已结束晚宴上楼了，她得快点！","Lucy came running full tilt downstairs, having just nipped in to the drawing-room to smooth a cover, to straighten a chair, to pause a moment and feel whoever came in must think how clean, how bright, how beautifully cared for, when they saw the beautiful silver, the brass fire-irons, the new chair-covers, and the curtains of yellow chintz: she appraised each; heard a roar of voices; people already coming up from dinner; she must fly!"
"阿格尼丝说，首相要来了。她听到客人们在饭厅里这样讲的。她一边说，一边端着一盘玻璃杯走进来。有什么要紧的，多一个或者少一个首相，有丝毫要紧吗？在晚上的这一时间，这消息对置身于一大堆盘子、深平底锅、漏锅、煎锅、鸡肉冻、冰激凌冷冻机、削掉的面包皮、柠檬、带盖子的大汤碗、布丁盘中间的沃克太太来说，是丝毫没有影响的。不管他们在洗碗槽怎样使劲擦洗，这堆碗碟仿佛还压在她头上，摆在厨房的桌上、椅上，炉火耀眼、熊熊燃烧着，电灯发出刺眼的光，还要准备宵夜。她只觉得，多一个或者少一个首相对沃克夫人来说，没有一点区别。","The Prime Minister was coming, Agnes said: so she had heard them say in the dining-room, she said, coming in with a tray of glasses.Did it matter, did it matter in the least, one Prime Minister more or less?It made no difference at this hour of the night to Mrs. Walker among the plates, saucepans, cullenders, frying-pans, chicken in aspic, ice-cream freezers, pared crusts of bread, lemons, soup tureens, and pudding basins which, however hard they washed up in the scullery seemed to be all on top of her, on the kitchen table, on chairs, while the fire blared and roared, the electric lights glared, and still supper had to be laid.All she felt was, one Prime Minister more or less made not a scrap of difference to Mrs. Walker."
"女士们已经在上楼了，露西说道。女士们正在上楼，一个接一个，走在最后面的是达洛维夫人，她几乎总是叫人给厨房传信。有一个晚上是“向沃克夫人致以我的爱意”。第二天早上她们会回顾那一道道菜——汤啦、鲑鱼啦。沃克太太知道鲑鱼像往常一样没有熟透，因为她老不放心布丁，便叫珍妮来照看鲑鱼，于是就发生了这事，鲑鱼老是没熟透。可露西说，一位头发金黄、戴着银饰的夫人谈起了正菜间的小菜，问真的是在家里做的吗？但当沃克太太不停地转着盘子，将风门推进拉出的时候，让她不安的还是鲑鱼。从饭厅爆发出一阵笑声，一个声音在说，接着又有一阵笑声——女士们离开后先生们正玩得开心呢。露西跑来说道，匈牙利托考伊白葡萄酒。达洛维先生传话要匈牙利托考伊白葡萄酒，是珍藏在皇家酒窖中的，皇家匈牙利托考伊白葡萄酒。","The ladies were going upstairs already, said Lucy; the ladies were going up, one by one, Mrs. Dalloway walking last and almost always sending back some message to the kitchen, “My love to Mrs. Walker,” that was it one night.Next morning they would go over the dishes—the soup, the salmon; the salmon, Mrs. Walker knew, as usual underdone, for she always got nervous about the pudding and left it to Jenny; so it happened, the salmon was always underdone.But some lady with fair hair and silver ornaments had said, Lucy said, about the entree, was it really made at home?But it was the salmon that bothered Mrs. Walker, as she spun the plates round and round, and pulled in dampers and pulled out dampers; and there came a burst of laughter from the dining-room; a voice speaking; then another burst of laughter—the gentlemen enjoying themselves when the ladies had gone.The tokay, said Lucy running in.Mr. Dalloway had sent for the tokay, from the Emperor’s cellars, the Imperial Tokay."
"酒从厨房里被端了上来。露西转过头说伊丽莎白小姐看起来可爱极了。她无法不盯着她看。她一袭粉红裙子，戴上了达洛维先生送的项链。珍妮得记住那条狗，伊丽莎白的猎狐犬，因为它会咬人，不得不给关起来，伊丽莎白想，它也许想吃点什么了。珍妮一定要记住那条狗。但珍妮在到处都是那些客人的时候是不会上楼的。大门口已经来了一辆汽车！有人按门铃——而那些先生仍在饭厅里，喝匈牙利托考伊白葡萄酒呢！","It was borne through the kitchen.Over her shoulder Lucy reported how Miss Elizabeth looked quite lovely; she couldn’t take her eyes off her; in her pink dress, wearing the necklace Mr. Dalloway had given her.Jenny must remember the dog, Miss Elizabeth’s fox-terrier, which, since it bit, had to be shut up and might, Elizabeth thought, want something.Jenny must remember the dog.But Jenny was not going upstairs with all those people about.There was a motor at the door already!There was a ring at the bell—and the gentlemen still in the dining-room, drinking tokay!"
"瞧，先生们上楼了。这是第一批到的，现在客人们会来得越来越快，所以帕金森夫人（为了宴会而雇来的）将把大厅门半开着。大厅里将挤满等候着的先生们（他们站在那里等着，把头发梳得光亮），同时女士们在过道边的房间里把披风脱掉。巴尼特夫人在那里帮忙，就是和达洛维一家呆了四十年的老埃伦·巴尼特，每个夏季都来帮助女士们。她还记得这些做母亲的人少女时的模样。尽管她很谦逊，还会跟别人握手，非常尊敬地称呼别人“夫人”，然而她有种幽默的风度，看着年轻的女士们，并非常巧妙地帮了洛夫乔伊太太的忙，她的紧身底衣穿起来不大方便。洛夫乔伊太太与艾丽丝小姐不禁觉得在梳妆的时候她俩获得了一点优先照顾，因为她俩认识巴尼特夫人已经有——“三十年，太太。”巴尼特夫人补充道。洛夫乔伊太太说道，从前她们在伯顿做客时，年轻女士们不习惯用口红呢。艾丽丝小姐不必涂口红，巴尼特夫人说，一边怜爱地看着她。巴尼特夫人会坐在衣帽间里，轻轻抚平毛皮斗篷，抚平西班牙式披巾，整理好梳妆台，虽然小姐太太们都穿着毛皮斗篷与刺绣衣裳，但谁好谁不好，她都知道得一清二楚。亲爱的老家伙，洛夫乔伊夫人一边爬楼梯一边说道，克拉丽莎的老保姆。","There, they were going upstairs; that was the first to come, and now they would come faster and faster, so that Mrs. Parkinson (hired for parties) would leave the hall door ajar, and the hall would be full of gentlemen waiting (they stood waiting, sleeking down their hair) while the ladies took their cloaks off in the room along the passage; where Mrs. Barnet helped them, old Ellen Barnet, who had been with the family for forty years, and came every summer to help the ladies, and remembered mothers when they were girls, and though very unassuming did shake hands; said “milady” very respectfully, yet had a humorous way with her, looking at the young ladies, and ever so tactfully helping Lady Lovejoy, who had some trouble with her underbodice.And they could not help feeling, Lady Lovejoy and Miss Alice, that some little privilege in the matter of brush and comb, was awarded them having known Mrs. Barnet—“thirty years, milady,” Mrs. Barnet supplied her.Young ladies did not use to rouge, said Lady Lovejoy, when they stayed at Bourton in the old days.And Miss Alice didn’t need rouge, said Mrs. Barnet, looking at her fondly.There Mrs. Barnet would sit, in the cloakroom, patting down the furs, smoothing out the Spanish shawls, tidying the dressing-table, and knowing perfectly well, in spite of the furs and the embroideries, which were nice ladies, which were not.The dear old body, said Lady Lovejoy, mounting the stairs, Clarissa’s old nurse."
"接着洛夫乔伊太太挺了挺身子。“洛夫乔伊太太和小姐。”她对着威尔金斯先生说（为了宴会而雇来的）。他很有礼貌，弯身又直起，弯身又直起，不偏不倚地通告“洛夫乔伊太太和小姐……约翰爵士和尼达姆太太……韦尔德小姐……沃尔什先生”。他举止得体，家庭生活肯定美满，只可惜，一个嘴唇发青、脸刮得很干净的人怎会闯入养儿育女的麻烦事中，看来于理不通嘛。","And then Lady Lovejoy stiffened.“Lady and Miss Lovejoy,” she said to Mr. Wilkins (hired for parties).He had an admirable manner, as he bent and straightened himself, bent and straightened himself and announced with perfect impartiality “Lady and Miss Lovejoy... Sir John and Lady Needham... Miss Weld... Mr. Walsh.”His manner was admirable; his family life must be irreproachable, except that it seemed impossible that a being with greenish lips and shaven cheeks could ever have blundered into the nuisance of children."
"“很高兴见到您！”克拉丽莎说道。她对每位客人都说这句话。很高兴见到您！那是她最糟糕的时候了——感情横溢、不诚恳。来赴宴是一个巨大的失误。他本该留在家中读书的，彼得·沃尔什想，本该去音乐厅，本该留在家中，因为他不认识一个人。","“How delightful to see you!” said Clarissa.She said it to every one.How delightful to see you!She was at her worst—effusive, insincere.It was a great mistake to have come.He should have stayed at home and read his book, thought Peter Walsh; should have gone to a music hall; he should have stayed at home, for he knew no one."
"啊，天哪，这次宴会要失败了，彻底地失败，克拉丽莎骨子里这样觉得。因为亲爱的老勋爵莱克斯汉姆站在她面前替他太太致歉，说她在赴白金汉宫游园会时感冒了。她能从眼角边瞧见彼得，他在那里，在那个角落里，一副批评的表情。说到底，她为什么要做这些事啊？为什么要追求顶峰而深陷火海啊？不论如何，但愿火毁灭她！把她燃成灰烬吧！无论如何，即便是挥舞着自己的火把，然后把它扔在地上也比像某个埃莉·亨德森那样逐渐销蚀、消失不见要好。真是怪了，彼得仅仅是走进来站在角落里就让她产生这些情绪。他让她看到了自己；夸张。白痴一般。但是他为什么要来，只是为了指责她吗？他为什么老是汲取，从不给予呢？为什么不为自己的一个小主意冒点风险呢？瞧他要走开了，她得跟他谈一下。但她不会有机会。生活就是如此——屈辱，克己。莱克斯汉姆勋爵正解释着他太太在赴游园会时不愿披上毛皮大衣，因为“我亲爱的，你们女士们都很像”——莱克斯汉姆太太年纪至少七十五啦！真有美妙极了，那老两口相互亲昵得很呢。她确实喜欢老莱克斯汉姆勋爵。她真的认为自己的宴会是重要的，所以在认识到全都不顺利，全都失败时，她觉得着实难过。无论什么，任何爆炸、任何恐怖都好过宾客们漫无目标地闲逛，一堆堆站在角落里，如埃莉·亨德森那样，甚至都不在意自己是否站直了。","Oh dear, it was going to be a failure; a complete failure, Clarissa felt it in her bones as dear old Lord Lexham stood there apologising for his wife who had caught cold at the Buckingham Palace garden party.She could see Peter out of the tail of her eye, criticising her, there, in that corner.Why, after all, did she do these things?Why seek pinnacles and stand drenched in fire?Might it consume her anyhow!Burn her to cinders!Better anything, better brandish one’s torch and hurl it to earth than taper and dwindle away like some Ellie Henderson!It was extraordinary how Peter put her into these states just by coming and standing in a corner.He made her see herself; exaggerate.It was idiotic.But why did he come, then, merely to criticise?Why always take, never give?Why not risk one’s one little point of view?There he was wandering off, and she must speak to him.But she would not get the chance.Life was that—humiliation, renunciation.What Lord Lexham was saying was that his wife would not wear her furs at the garden party because “my dear, you ladies are all alike”—Lady Lexham being seventy-five at least!It was delicious, how they petted each other, that old couple.She did like old Lord Lexham.She did think it mattered, her party, and it made her feel quite sick to know that it was all going wrong, all falling flat.Anything, any explosion, any horror was better than people wandering aimlessly, standing in a bunch at a corner like Ellie Henderson, not even caring to hold themselves upright."
"有极乐鸟图案的黄色窗帘被风轻轻吹了起来，仿佛有些羽翼飞进屋子，立即飞了出来，随后又被吸了进来。（因为窗户是敞开的。）埃莉·亨德森心想，是过堂风吗？她容易着凉。但即便她明天打喷嚏病倒也无关紧要。她想着的是那些裸肩姑娘们，因为年老的父亲教育她关心他人，老父亲是前任伯顿教区牧师，身体有疾，他已去世了。而她着凉从未殃及胸部，从未有过。她心里想的是那些姑娘，那些裸肩的年轻姑娘。她自己一直身体纤弱，头发稀少，体型瘦小。如今五十多岁了，却开始闪耀出一种柔和的光芒，这是多年来自我克制而净化出来的杰出，然而这光芒又黯淡了，永久地黯淡了，由于她那令人痛苦的斯文，她那没有理由的恐惧，这些都源于她家的收入只有三百英镑，以及她处于毫无保障的境况（她挣不了一便士），这令她怯懦，一年一年地越来越无资格同穿着入时的人士聚会。他们在社交频繁的季节每晚都这样聚会，只需给女佣们说一声“我要穿哪件衣服”就可以了。但是埃莉·亨德森会惴惴不安地跑出去买半打便宜的淡红花朵，然后在黑色旧衣服上搭一条围巾。因为她是在最后一刻收到克拉丽莎聚会的请柬的。她对此不是很愉快。她有一种克拉丽莎今年本不打算请她的感觉。","Gently the yellow curtain with all the birds of Paradise blew out and it seemed as if there were a flight of wings into the room, right out, then sucked back.(For the windows were open.) Was it draughty, Ellie Henderson wondered?She was subject to chills.But it did not matter that she should come down sneezing tomorrow; it was the girls with their naked shoulders she thought of, being trained to think of others by an old father, an invalid, late vicar of Bourton, but he was dead now; and her chills never went to her chest, never.It was the girls she thought of, the young girls with their bare shoulders, she herself having always been a wisp of a creature, with her thin hair and meagre profile; though now, past fifty, there was beginning to shine through some mild beam, something purified into distinction by years of self-abnegation but obscured again, perpetually, by her distressing gentility, her panic fear, which arose from three hundred pounds’ income, and her weaponless state (she could not earn a penny) and it made her timid, and more and more disqualified year by year to meet well-dressed people who did this sort of thing every night of the season, merely telling their maids “I’ll wear so and so,” whereas Ellie Henderson ran out nervously and bought cheap pink flowers, half a dozen, and then threw a shawl over her old black dress.For her invitation to Clarissa’s party had come at the last moment.She was not quite happy about it.She had a sort of feeling that Clarissa had not meant to ask her this year."
"为什么要邀请她呢？真的没什么理由，除了她俩向来就认识彼此之外。其实，她俩是表姐妹。但是她们很自然地越来越远，因为克拉丽莎交友广泛。对埃莉而言这是桩大事，要去赴宴呢。单是瞧瞧那些华丽的礼服就是件乐事。难道那不是伊丽莎白么，长大了，发式梳得很时髦，穿着一袭粉色礼服？但她至多十七岁吧。她非常、非常漂亮。不过那些女孩第一次参加社交活动时，不像以前那样穿白色礼服了。（她得牢记每件事好告诉伊迪丝。）少女们穿着紧身上衣，裹得紧紧的，裙子都在踝关节以上。这样穿不合适吧，她心想。","Why should she?There was no reason really, except that they had always known each other.Indeed, they were cousins.But naturally they had rather drifted apart, Clarissa being so sought after.It was an event to her, going to a party.It was quite a treat just to see the lovely clothes.Wasn’t that Elizabeth, grown up, with her hair done in the fashionable way, in the pink dress?Yet she could not be more than seventeen.She was very, very handsome.But girls when they first came out didn’t seem to wear white as they used.(She must remember everything to tell Edith.) Girls wore straight frocks, perfectly tight, with skirts well above the ankles.It was not becoming, she thought."
"因为视力很弱，埃莉·亨德森使劲向前伸着脖子，她不是很在意没人跟她谈天（那里她几乎不认识任何人），因为她觉得她看着的这些人都很有意思，可能有些是政治家，那是理查德·达洛维的朋友。但是理查德自己觉得不能让这个可怜的人整晚一个人站着。","So, with her weak eyesight, Ellie Henderson craned rather forward, and it wasn’t so much she who minded not having any one to talk to (she hardly knew anybody there), for she felt that they were all such interesting people to watch; politicians presumably; Richard Dalloway’s friends; but it was Richard himself who felt that he could not let the poor creature go on standing there all the evening by herself."
"“嗨，埃莉，你的近况怎样？”他和蔼地说道。而埃莉·亨德森变得紧张、脸红。她觉得他真好，竟过来跟她攀谈。她说很多人比起冷来更怕热。","“Well, Ellie, and how’s the world treating YOU?” he said in his genial way, and Ellie Henderson, getting nervous and flushing and feeling that it was extraordinarily nice of him to come and talk to her, said that many people really felt the heat more than the cold."
"“是的，人们是这样的。”理查德·达洛维说道。“确实是。”","“Yes, they do,” said Richard Dalloway.“Yes.”"
"但还有什么话可说呢？","But what more did one say?"
"“嘿，理查德。”有人在喊，一边抓住他的肘部，哦，上帝啊，那是老彼得，老朋友彼得·沃尔什。理查德很高兴见到他——见到他十分愉快！他丝毫没变。他们一道穿过房间离开了，彼此轻拍着，似乎他俩很长时间没见过一样。埃莉·亨德森看着他们离开，心想她一定见过那个男人的脸。一个高个子的中年人，有非常漂亮的眼睛，乌黑发亮，戴着眼镜，一副约翰·伯罗斯一样的神情。伊迪丝肯定知道这个人是谁。","“Hullo, Richard,” said somebody, taking him by the elbow, and, good Lord, there was old Peter, old Peter Walsh.He was delighted to see him—ever so pleased to see him!He hadn’t changed a bit.And off they went together walking right across the room, giving each other little pats, as if they hadn’t met for a long time, Ellie Henderson thought, watching them go, certain she knew that man’s face.A tall man, middle aged, rather fine eyes, dark, wearing spectacles, with a look of John Burrows.Edith would be sure to know."
"有一群极乐鸟图案的窗帘又被风吹开了。克拉丽莎瞧见——她瞧见拉尔夫·莱昂把帘子拉好，又继续交谈。那么晚会毕竟没有失败！如今一切都会好起来——她的宴会。它才开始。刚起了个头。但是仍然很难说。她暂时得站在一旁。来宾仿佛一下涌了进来。","The curtain with its flight of birds of Paradise blew out again.And Clarissa saw—she saw Ralph Lyon beat it back, and go on talking.So it wasn’t a failure after all!it was going to be all right now—her party.It had begun.It had started.But it was still touch and go.She must stand there for the present.People seemed to come in a rush."
"加罗德上校与夫人……休·惠特布雷德先生……鲍利先生……希尔伯里夫人……玛丽·马多克斯女士……奎因先生……威尔金拉长声调报人名。克拉丽莎与每位宾客寒暄了六七个字。然后他们继续走，走进屋子。自从拉尔夫·莱昂已经把窗帘拍回去后，现在客人们走进去已经有事情可以做了，并非什么都没有。","Colonel and Mrs. Garrod... Mr. Hugh Whitbread... Mr. Bowley... Mrs. Hilbery... Lady Mary Maddox... Mr. Quin... intoned Wilkin.She had six or seven words with each, and they went on, they went into the rooms; into something now, not nothing, since Ralph Lyon had beat back the curtain."
"可是就她自己而言，费的力气太多了。她并没有享受其中。她太像——太像随便哪个人了，站在那里。任何人都会这样做。但她确实有些欣赏这一个谁，不免觉得无论如何她把晚会办成功了，这标志了一个阶段，她感到这是自己的工作。因为说来也怪，她都快忘记自己长得什么样子了，却感到自己是楼梯顶层钉着的一根木桩。每一回她举行宴会都有这种感觉，这不是真正的自己，并且感到每个人在某一方面是不真实的，但在另外一方面要真实得多。她想，部分是由于他们的着装，部分是由于他们脱离了日常行为习惯，部分是由于背景，在宴会上可以谈些在其他场合无论如何也不能谈的话题，那些得费劲来谈的话题，也许会谈得更深入些。但是她不行，至少目前还不行。","And yet for her own part, it was too much of an effort.She was not enjoying it.It was too much like being—just anybody, standing there; anybody could do it; yet this anybody she did a little admire, couldn’t help feeling that she had, anyhow, made this happen, that it marked a stage, this post that she felt herself to have become, for oddly enough she had quite forgotten what she looked like, but felt herself a stake driven in at the top of her stairs.Every time she gave a party she had this feeling of being something not herself, and that every one was unreal in one way; much more real in another.It was, she thought, partly their clothes, partly being taken out of their ordinary ways, partly the background, it was possible to say things you couldn’t say anyhow else, things that needed an effort; possible to go much deeper.But not for her; not yet anyhow."
"“很高兴看到您！”她说道。是亲爱的老哈里爵士！他认得这里的每个人。","“How delightful to see you!” she said.Dear old Sir Harry!He would know every one."
"很怪的是，当客人们一个接着一个上楼时，她有了这样的感觉。芒特夫人与西莉亚，赫伯特·艾因斯蒂，戴克斯夫人——哦，还有布鲁顿女士！　　","And what was so odd about it was the sense one had as they came up the stairs one after another, Mrs. Mount and Celia, Herbert Ainsty, Mrs. Dakers—oh and Lady Bruton!"
"“您能来真是太赏脸了！”她说着，她说的是真的——很奇怪，就在那里站着感觉到人们不停地经过你，经过你，有些已经相当老了，有些……","“How awfully good of you to come!” she said, and she meant it—it was odd how standing there one felt them going on, going on, some quite old, some..."
"叫什么呢？罗塞特太太？但到底谁是罗塞特太太？","WHAT name?Lady Rosseter?But who on earth was Lady Rosseter?"
"“克拉丽莎！”那声音在喊！原来是萨莉·西顿！是萨莉·西顿！这么多年以后！她从迷雾中隐约现身。克拉丽莎握住这个火热的水壶时，她可不是现在这个样子。萨莉·西顿，想一想她竟在自己家里，在自己家里！她以前可不是这个样子！","“Clarissa!”That voice!It was Sally Seton!Sally Seton!after all these years!She loomed through a mist.For she hadn’t looked like THAT, Sally Seton, when Clarissa grasped the hot water can, to think of her under this roof, under this roof!Not like that!"
"彼此争相谈话，局促不安，笑着——穿过了伦敦；收到克拉拉·海登的信；多么难得的机会见到你！因此我就赶了过来——没被邀请就来了……","All on top of each other, embarrassed, laughing, words tumbled out—passing through London; heard from Clara Haydon; what a chance of seeing you!So I thrust myself in—without an invitation...."
"你可以很镇静地放下那个热水壶了。她已失去了光泽。但是与她重逢真是非同寻常，她老了，比当年快乐了，没那么好看了。她俩在客厅门前亲吻对方，先吻这边脸又吻那边脸。克拉丽莎握住萨莉的手，转身，只见屋内座无虚席，听见喧嚣的说话声，又看到烛台、微风拂动的帷幔还有理查德送她的玫瑰。","One might put down the hot water can quite composedly.The lustre had gone out of her.Yet it was extraordinary to see her again, older, happier, less lovely.They kissed each other, first this cheek then that, by the drawing-room door, and Clarissa turned, with Sally’s hand in hers, and saw her rooms full, heard the roar of voices, saw the candlesticks, the blowing curtains, and the roses which Richard had given her."
"“我有五个大块头的儿子啦。”萨莉说道。","“I have five enormous boys,” said Sally."
"她有最单纯的自我中心主义，向来是公开表示希望人们最先想到她，她还是那样，克拉丽莎非常喜欢她。“我根本不敢相信！”她大声说道，想起以前就快活地兴奋起来。","She had the simplest egotism, the most open desire to be thought first always, and Clarissa loved her for being still like that.“I can’t believe it!” she cried, kindling all over with pleasure at the thought of the past."
"不过，哎呀，威尔金斯，威尔金斯需要她。威尔金斯用庄严的权威音调——似乎他必须告诫所有客人，还得把女主人从轻浮的谈话中召唤回来——通报了一个名字：","But alas, Wilkins; Wilkins wanted her; Wilkins was emitting in a voice of commanding authority as if the whole company must be admonished and the hostess reclaimed from frivolity, one name:"
"“首相来了。”彼得·沃尔什说道。","“The Prime Minister,” said Peter Walsh."
"首相？当真？埃莉·亨德森感到惊奇。这可是个大新闻，得告诉伊迪丝！","The Prime Minister?Was it really?Ellie Henderson marvelled.What a thing to tell Edith!"
"你不能嘲笑他。他看起来普通极了。你可能当他是站在柜台后的售货员，向他买饼干——可怜的家伙，金色蕾丝装扮了全身。可公平地讲，他先由克拉丽莎、后由理查德陪伴着和大家见面的时候，举止非常得体。他尽量做出大人物的模样。看起来很有意思。没有谁看他。人们只是继续交谈着，但极为显然的是他们都清楚，从骨子里就感觉出了，这位大人物从旁边经过。他象征这里所有人代表的一个机构——英国社会。老布鲁顿女士呢，她瞧上去也很健康，表情十分坚定地翩翩而至。他们退入到一间小屋，房间马上受到人们的窥探、监视。某种骚动和沙沙声传遍了整个人群，毫不隐瞒地：首相来了！","One couldn’t laugh at him.He looked so ordinary.You might have stood him behind a counter and bought biscuits—poor chap, all rigged up in gold lace.And to be fair, as he went his rounds, first with Clarissa then with Richard escorting him, he did it very well.He tried to look somebody.It was amusing to watch.Nobody looked at him.They just went on talking, yet it was perfectly plain that they all knew, felt to the marrow of their bones, this majesty passing; this symbol of what they all stood for, English society.Old Lady Bruton, and she looked very fine too, very stalwart in her face, swam up, and they withdrew into a little room which at once became spied upon, guarded, and a sort of stir and rustle rippled through every one, openly: the Prime Minister!"
"上帝啊，上帝啊，英国人真势利呀！彼得·沃尔什想，在角落里站着。他们多爱装饰上金色蕾丝来致意啊！瞧那里！那一定是，天啊，的确是休·惠特布雷德，在显贵身旁卑躬屈膝，变得更胖了，发丝更白了，可敬的休！","Lord, lord, the snobbery of the English!thought Peter Walsh, standing in the corner.How they loved dressing up in gold lace and doing homage!There!That must be, by Jove it was, Hugh Whitbread, snuffing round the precincts of the great, grown rather fatter, rather whiter, the admirable Hugh!"
"他看来似乎老在执行公务，彼得心想，一个特权在身又神秘兮兮的家伙，藏着宁死守护的机密。虽然这仅仅是从一个宫廷侍从那里偶然听来的一点八卦新闻，明天就会见诸各报刊。他玩的就是这类小把戏，小玩意儿，在玩弄这些的过程中头发都变白了，步入了老年的边缘，博得了大家的敬重及拥戴，这些人幸运地认识了这位英国公学毕业的典型。人们必然会杜撰有关休诸如此类的轶事。这是他的风格。彼得在几千英里外的大洋彼岸，从《泰晤士报》上读到的那些令人钦佩的信件的风格，谢天谢地他脱离了那有害的喧哗，即便是只听得见狒狒的叫嚷声以及苦力们打自己妻子的吵闹声也好。一位来自一所大学的橄榄色皮肤的年轻人巴结地站在一边。休会照顾他，教他入门，如何向上爬。因为他最乐于助人，使老妇人们的心高兴地怦怦直跳。正当她们感到自己岁数大了，病痛缠身，认为自己被人遗忘了的时候，亲爱的休还念着她们，驱车来陪她们消磨一小时聊聊过去，怀念一些琐事，赞扬老妇人的家庭自制糕点，尽管休一生中每天都可能陪伴一位公爵夫人吃糕点。看看他那样子，可能真的在这件令人惬意的差事上花费了大量的时间。那审判众生、无比仁慈的上帝也许会宽恕他。但彼得·沃尔什不会宽恕他。世间必然有恶棍，但上帝明了那个在火车上将一位姑娘打出脑浆而被绞死的坏蛋造成的危害大体来说也比休·惠特布雷德和他的好心造成的危害要少些。看看他此刻的模样。当首相和布鲁顿夫人露面的时候，他踮起脚尖、逢迎着向前走，点头哈腰的，向全世界暗示他有这份殊荣，能在布鲁顿女士经过时说上几句私密的话。她停了下来。她晃了晃年老而健康的脑袋。她可能是在对他的某个奉承行为表示感谢。她有几个谄媚者，政府机构里的小官，为她奔走四方执行一些小差使，作为回报她就宴请他们共进午餐。不过她这是源自十八世纪的作风。她可以这样做。","He looked always as if he were on duty, thought Peter, a privileged, but secretive being, hoarding secrets which he would die to defend, though it was only some little piece of tittle-tattle dropped by a court footman, which would be in all the papers tomorrow.Such were his rattles, his baubles, in playing with which he had grown white, come to the verge of old age, enjoying the respect and affection of all who had the privilege of knowing this type of the English public school man.Inevitably one made up things like that about Hugh; that was his style; the style of those admirable letters which Peter had read thousands of miles across the sea in the @Times@, and had thanked God he was out of that pernicious hubble-bubble if it were only to hear baboons chatter and coolies beat their wives.An olive-skinned youth from one of the Universities stood obsequiously by.Him he would patronise, initiate, teach how to get on.For he liked nothing better than doing kindnesses, making the hearts of old ladies palpitate with the joy of being thought of in their age, their affliction, thinking themselves quite forgotten, yet here was dear Hugh driving up and spending an hour talking of the past, remembering trifles, praising the home-made cake, though Hugh might eat cake with a Duchess any day of his life, and, to look at him, probably did spend a good deal of time in that agreeable occupation.The All-judging, the All-merciful, might excuse.Peter Walsh had no mercy.Villains there must be, and God knows the rascals who get hanged for battering the brains of a girl out in a train do less harm on the whole than Hugh Whitbread and his kindness.Look at him now, on tiptoe, dancing forward, bowing and scraping, as the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton emerged, intimating for all the world to see that he was privileged to say something, something private, to Lady Bruton as she passed.She stopped.She wagged her fine old head.She was thanking him presumably for some piece of servility.She had her toadies, minor officials in Government offices who ran about putting through little jobs on her behalf, in return for which she gave them luncheon.But she derived from the eighteenth century.She was all right."
"此刻克拉丽莎陪伴她的首相走过屋子，昂首阔步，神采飞扬，她灰白的发丝显出庄严。她佩戴着耳环，身穿一条银绿色美人鱼样式的裙子。她似乎在波浪之上闲荡，编着发辫，仍保持着她那份天赋，活着，存在着，在她经过的那一刻对一切了然于胸。她转过头，围巾挂在了某位女士的衣服上，她解开了，笑着，一切都应付自如，那神态犹如一个漂浮在自己环境中的生灵。然而光阴已拂过她身旁，正如在某个无比清澈的傍晚，美人鱼也许会从水波如镜的海面上窥见夕阳。她散发出柔和的气息。她的严峻、矜持、呆板如今全都融化了。当她向那个装饰着金色蕾丝的、竭尽全力显得重要的（祝他成功）健壮男人道别时，呈现出一种不可名状的庄严，一种优雅的热忱。仿佛她但愿全世界诸事顺利，而现在她处在万物的边缘，只得告别了。她给那个男子的印象正是这样。（可他并未陷入爱情。）","And now Clarissa escorted her Prime Minister down the room, prancing, sparkling, with the stateliness of her grey hair.She wore ear-rings, and a silver-green mermaid’s dress.Lolloping on the waves and braiding her tresses she seemed, having that gift still; to be; to exist; to sum it all up in the moment as she passed; turned, caught her scarf in some other woman’s dress, unhitched it, laughed, all with the most perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its element.But age had brushed her; even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves.There was a breath of tenderness; her severity, her prudery, her woodenness were all warmed through now, and she had about her as she said good-bye to the thick gold-laced man who was doing his best, and good luck to him, to look important, an inexpressible dignity; an exquisite cordiality; as if she wished the whole world well, and must now, being on the very verge and rim of things, take her leave.So she made him think.(But he was not in love.)"
"的确，克拉丽莎觉得首相驾临实属荣幸。并且，她陪他走过屋子，有萨莉在场，彼得也在场，理查德满意极了，也许所有这些客人都对她颇为艳羡，她此刻感觉到陶醉，心的神经在扩张，直到心脏仿佛在震颤、沉醉、振奋——是的，可终究这一切是别人的感受。这是因为虽然她喜爱这种氛围并感到刺激和兴奋，不过这些外在的事物、这些胜利（比方说，亲爱的老友彼得认为她太厉害了）是空虚的。它们在一臂的距离之内是成就，但在她的心里不是。也许是因为她逐渐变老，这些事情再也不能像过去那样令她满意。忽然间，当她瞥见首相下楼时，镶着乔舒亚爵士画的、戴着皮手筒的小女孩肖像的圆形镀金画框令她猛然想起基尔曼——她的仇人基尔曼。那是令人满意的，那是真实的。啊，她是多么憎恶基尔曼啊——急躁、伪善、堕落，又有这么大的能量，诱惑了伊丽莎白。这女人悄悄摸进来窃走并亵渎了她的女儿（理查德则会说瞎扯）。她憎恶她，又爱她。人需要的是敌人，并非友人——并非达兰特夫人与克拉拉，威廉·布拉德肖爵士及其太太，特鲁洛克小姐及埃莉诺·吉布森（她看到她们正在上楼）。倘若他们需要她，必定会来寻她。她要照顾宴会！","Indeed, Clarissa felt, the Prime Minister had been good to come.And, walking down the room with him, with Sally there and Peter there and Richard very pleased, with all those people rather inclined, perhaps, to envy, she had felt that intoxication of the moment, that dilatation of the nerves of the heart itself till it seemed to quiver, steeped, upright;—yes, but after all it was what other people felt, that; for, though she loved it and felt it tingle and sting, still these semblances, these triumphs (dear old Peter, for example, thinking her so brilliant), had a hollowness; at arm’s length they were, not in the heart; and it might be that she was growing old but they satisfied her no longer as they used; and suddenly, as she saw the Prime Minister go down the stairs, the gilt rim of the Sir Joshua picture of the little girl with a muff brought back Kilman with a rush; Kilman her enemy.That was satisfying; that was real.Ah, how she hated her—hot, hypocritical, corrupt; with all that power; Elizabeth’s seducer; the woman who had crept in to steal and defile (Richard would say, What nonsense!).She hated her: she loved her.It was enemies one wanted, not friends—not Mrs. Durrant and Clara, Sir William and Lady Bradshaw, Miss Truelock and Eleanor Gibson (whom she saw coming upstairs).They must find her if they wanted her.She was for the party!"
"她的老友哈里爵士就在那边。","There was her old friend Sir Harry."
"“敬爱的哈里爵士！”她说着，一边走向那好老头，他作的蹩脚之画比圣约翰森林画院所有人中任意两位会员的作品之和都要多。他老是画牛——站在薄暮中的池塘边汲水，或者描绘牛跷起一条前腿，牛角上扬，象征“陌生人的到来”。因为他了解一定范围内的牛的姿势——他的一切活动，出去就餐、赛马，都是以站在薄暮中的池塘边汲水的牛为基础的。","“Dear Sir Harry!” she said, going up to the fine old fellow who had produced more bad pictures than any other two Academicians in the whole of St. John’s Wood (they were always of cattle, standing in sunset pools absorbing moisture, or signifying, for he had a certain range of gesture, by the raising of one foreleg and the toss of the antlers, “the Approach of the Stranger”—all his activities, dining out, racing, were founded on cattle standing absorbing moisture in sunset pools)."
"“你们在笑什么？”她问他道。因为威利·蒂特科姆、哈里爵士与赫伯特·艾因斯蒂都在笑。可是不行。哈里爵士不能告诉克拉丽莎·达洛维（虽然他非常喜欢她，觉得她在她同类人里是完美的，还说要为她画肖像）他的有关音乐厅舞台的事。他用她的宴会来开玩笑。他惦念着他的白兰地酒。他说这些上流圈子的人高不可攀。但他喜欢她、尊重她，虽然她有可恶的、不易接近的上流人士的风雅，这令他不可能叫克拉丽莎·达洛维坐在自己的膝上。走过来的是希尔伯里老夫人，似飘散的鬼火、捉摸不定的磷光，在他爆发出来的大笑声中伸出了手（笑的是公爵和夫人）。她听到这声音从房间一头传来，这似乎令她对有时会困扰她的一件事情更放心——有时她起得早的时候，不愿意叫女仆给她端茶——我们一定都会死去。","“What are you laughing at?” she asked him.For Willie Titcomb and Sir Harry and Herbert Ainsty were all laughing.But no.Sir Harry could not tell Clarissa Dalloway (much though he liked her; of her type he thought her perfect, and threatened to paint her) his stories of the music hall stage.He chaffed her about her party.He missed his brandy.These circles, he said, were above him.But he liked her; respected her, in spite of her damnable, difficult upper-class refinement, which made it impossible to ask Clarissa Dalloway to sit on his knee.And up came that wandering will-o’-the-wisp, that vagulous phosphorescence, old Mrs. Hilbery, stretching her hands to the blaze of his laughter (about the Duke and the Lady), which, as she heard it across the room, seemed to reassure her on a point which sometimes bothered her if she woke early in the morning and did not like to call her maid for a cup of tea; how it is certain we must die."
"“他们不愿告诉我们他们的故事。”克拉丽莎说道。","“They won’t tell us their stories,” said Clarissa."
"“亲爱的克拉丽莎啊！”希尔伯里夫人大声说道。克拉丽莎今晚看起来，她说，很像她初次见到她母亲戴着灰色帽子在花园漫步的模样。","“Dear Clarissa!” exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery.She looked tonight, she said, so like her mother as she first saw her walking in a garden in a grey hat."
"克拉丽莎眼里真的噙满了泪水。她的母亲漫步在一个花园中！但，哎呀，她必须要走了。","And really Clarissa’s eyes filled with tears.Her mother, walking in a garden!But alas, she must go."
"因为讲授弥尔顿的布赖尔利教授正与瘦小的吉姆·赫顿交谈（吉姆连参加这样的一个宴会都不打领结、不穿西装背心、也不把头发梳平），她即使隔着这么远的距离也可以看出两人在争辩。因为布赖尔利教授是一个很怪的人。他拥有那么多学位、荣誉、讲师资格，所以跟小文人相遇时会立即察觉出氛围对于他形成古怪的性格不利。他博学又怯懦。他有冷酷的魅力，但是一点都没有亲和力。他单纯又势利。要是他从一位女士凌乱的头发，一个年轻人所穿的靴子上意识到一个由叛逆者、热忱青年和自诩为天才的人构成的、确定无疑是值得赞扬的下层社会存在时，就会颤抖，微微扬起头，吸鼻子——哼！表现出温和节制的重要性。为了能够欣赏弥尔顿，一定的古典文学素养是多么重要。布赖尔利教授（克拉丽莎能看出来）与瘦小的吉姆·赫顿（吉姆穿着红色袜子，那双黑色袜子在洗衣间里）谈论弥尔顿不合拍。她便打断了。","For there was Professor Brierly, who lectured on Milton, talking to little Jim Hutton (who was unable even for a party like this to compass both tie and waistcoat or make his hair lie flat), and even at this distance they were quarrelling, she could see.For Professor Brierly was a very queer fish.With all those degrees, honours, lectureships between him and the scribblers he suspected instantly an atmosphere not favourable to his queer compound; his prodigious learning and timidity; his wintry charm without cordiality; his innocence blent with snobbery; he quivered if made conscious by a lady’s unkempt hair, a youth’s boots, of an underworld, very creditable doubtless, of rebels, of ardent young people; of would-be geniuses, and intimated with a little toss of the head, with a sniff—Humph!—the value of moderation; of some slight training in the classics in order to appreciate Milton.Professor Brierly (Clarissa could see) wasn’t hitting it off with little Jim Hutton (who wore red socks, his black being at the laundry) about Milton.She interrupted."
"她说自己爱巴赫的曲子。赫顿也如此。那是两人间的纽带，而赫顿（一个很蹩脚的诗人）总是觉得达洛维夫人是对艺术感兴趣的贵妇人中最优秀的一位，远远胜过其他人。很怪的是她多严苛啊。对于音乐她纯粹是客观的。她表现得相当一本正经。但看上去多有魅力呀！她把家里布置得如此精美，如果没有这些教授在场就好了。克拉丽莎颇有意拉他过去让他坐在里屋的钢琴边。因为他弹得似天籁之音。","She said she loved Bach.So did Hutton.That was the bond between them, and Hutton (a very bad poet) always felt that Mrs. Dalloway was far the best of the great ladies who took an interest in art.It was odd how strict she was.About music she was purely impersonal.She was rather a prig.But how charming to look at!She made her house so nice if it weren’t for her Professors.Clarissa had half a mind to snatch him off and set him down at the piano in the back room.For he played divinely."
"“但噪音太大！”“噪音！”","“But the noise!” she said.“The noise!”"
"“一个成功的宴会的标志。”教授彬彬有礼地颔首，优雅地离去了。","“The sign of a successful party.”Nodding urbanely, the Professor stepped delicately off."
"“他了解整个世上有关弥尔顿的一切。”克拉丽莎说道。","“He knows everything in the whole world about Milton,” said Clarissa."
"“真的吗？”赫顿说道，他会在整个汉普斯特德模仿这位教授、专长弥尔顿的教授、崇尚温和节制的教授、优雅离去的教授。","“Does he indeed?” said Hutton, who would imitate the Professor throughout Hampstead; the Professor on Milton; the Professor on moderation; the Professor stepping delicately off."
"但她一定要跟那两个人谈一谈了，克拉丽莎说道，就是盖顿勋爵与南希·布洛。","But she must speak to that couple, said Clarissa, Lord Gayton and Nancy Blow."
"并非是他俩明显地增大了宴会的噪音。他俩并不交谈（明显地），只是肩并肩站在黄色窗帘边。他俩一会儿就要去其他地方了，一同去。他俩在任何情况下都未曾有过过多言语。他俩对视着，如此而已。那便足矣。他俩看起来是如此干净、如此健康。她敷上脂粉的脸如杏花般娇艳，而他擦洗一新，有鸟一般锐利的目光，因此他不会错过任何球，也不会有任何一击能令他吃惊。他击球、跳起，百发百中，处于良好的竞技状态。小马的嘴在他缰绳下瑟瑟发抖。他有自己的荣誉，有祖先的纪念碑，旗帜悬挂在老家的教堂里。他有自己的职责，有自家的佃户，家有母亲及姊妹。全天都在洛兹板球场，达洛维夫人走过来时，他们正在谈论这些——板球、堂表亲、电影。盖顿勋爵非常喜欢她。布洛小姐也是如此。她是如此风度翩翩。","Not that THEY added perceptibly to the noise of the party.They were not talking (perceptibly) as they stood side by side by the yellow curtains.They would soon be off elsewhere, together; and never had very much to say in any circumstances.They looked; that was all.That was enough.They looked so clean, so sound, she with an apricot bloom of powder and paint, but he scrubbed, rinsed, with the eyes of a bird, so that no ball could pass him or stroke surprise him.He struck, he leapt, accurately, on the spot.Ponies’ mouths quivered at the end of his reins.He had his honours, ancestral monuments, banners hanging in the church at home.He had his duties; his tenants; a mother and sisters; had been all day at Lords, and that was what they were talking about—cricket, cousins, the movies—when Mrs. Dalloway came up.Lord Gayton liked her most awfully.So did Miss Blow.She had such charming manners."
"“太妙了——你们的光临太美妙了！”达洛维夫人说道。她爱勋爵们。她爱年轻人，而南希呢，身穿巴黎最杰出的设计师设计的、价格不菲的礼服站在那边，好像她的身体只是自然地生出了绿色褶边一样。","“It is angelic—it is delicious of you to have come!” she said.She loved Lords; she loved youth, and Nancy, dressed at enormous expense by the greatest artists in Paris, stood there looking as if her body had merely put forth, of its own accord, a green frill."
"“我本想举行舞会的。”克拉丽莎说道。","“I had meant to have dancing,” said Clarissa."
"因为年轻人不会聊天。而且他们为什么应该会呢？喊叫，拥抱，旋转，拂晓便起床，把糖喂给马吃，亲吻及抚摸可爱的中国狗的鼻子，接着怀着兴奋和激动，投身入水游起来。英语语言的巨大资源及其赋予的能力终究是交流情感（他与彼得像他们一般年轻时一整夜都会争辩）。这一点却没有被他们所领略。他们在年轻时就凝固成了现在的样子。年轻人会对庄园的人极其友好，可是独处时，或许无聊极了。","For the young people could not talk.And why should they?Shout, embrace, swing, be up at dawn; carry sugar to ponies; kiss and caress the snouts of adorable chows; and then all tingling and streaming, plunge and swim.But the enormous resources of the English language, the power it bestows, after all, of communicating feelings (at their age, she and Peter would have been arguing all the evening), was not for them.They would solidify young.They would be good beyond measure to the people on the estate, but alone, perhaps, rather dull."
"“真可惜啊！”克拉丽莎说道。“我本想举行舞会的。”","“What a pity!” she said.“I had hoped to have dancing.”"
"他们的光临真是格外赏脸！不过谈起跳舞嘛！那些屋子都挤满了人。","It was so extraordinarily nice of them to have come!But talk of dancing!The rooms were packed."
"年老的海伦娜姑妈披着围巾走来了。唉，克拉丽莎必须离开他俩了——盖顿勋爵与南希·布洛。老帕里小姐来了，她的姑妈。","There was old Aunt Helena in her shawl.Alas, she must leave them—Lord Gayton and Nancy Blow.There was old Miss Parry, her aunt."
"因为海伦娜·帕里小姐尚未过逝：帕里小姐仍活着。她已年过八旬。她拄着一根拐棍缓慢爬上楼梯。她被安排坐在椅子上（这是理查德关照的）。七十年代去过缅甸的人被不停地领来见她。彼得去了哪里？帕里小姐与他向来是很密切的朋友。因为一说到印度或者锡兰，她的双眼（仅有一只是玻璃的）便会缓缓变得深邃，变成蓝色，仿佛看见的并非人类——她对那些总督、将军、兵变毫无温馨的记忆，毫无引以为荣的幻想——她看见的是兰花、山中小径以及六十年代时自己被驮在苦力背上翻越幽僻山顶的情景。她或者下来连根拔起兰花（她以前从未见过这奇异的花），她还为此花作过水彩画。一位坚强的英国女人，如果战争，比如一枚炸弹正好落在她家门口，破坏了她对兰花以及她对自己六十年代游走印度时的身影的冥想，她会感到烦躁不安。但彼得在这里。","For Miss Helena Parry was not dead: Miss Parry was alive.She was past eighty.She ascended staircases slowly with a stick.She was placed in a chair (Richard had seen to it).People who had known Burma in the seventies were always led up to her.Where had Peter got to?They used to be such friends.For at the mention of India, or even Ceylon, her eyes (only one was glass) slowly deepened, became blue, beheld, not human beings—she had no tender memories, no proud illusions about Viceroys, Generals, Mutinies—it was orchids she saw, and mountain passes and herself carried on the backs of coolies in the sixties over solitary peaks; or descending to uproot orchids (startling blossoms, never beheld before) which she painted in water-colour; an indomitable Englishwoman, fretful if disturbed by the War, say, which dropped a bomb at her very door, from her deep meditation over orchids and her own figure journeying in the ‘sixties in India—but here was Peter."
"“来跟海伦娜姑妈聊聊缅甸的事吧。”克拉丽莎说道。","“Come and talk to Aunt Helena about Burma,” said Clarissa."
"可是他和她整晚未说过一句话！","And yet he had not had a word with her all the evening!"
"“咱们等一会儿再聊。”克拉丽莎说着，领他去了海伦娜姑妈那边，她围着白围巾，拄着拐棍。","“We will talk later,” said Clarissa, leading him up to Aunt Helena, in her white shawl, with her stick."
"“这是彼得·沃尔什。”克拉丽莎说道。","“Peter Walsh,” said Clarissa."
"一点反应也没有。","That meant nothing."
"克拉丽莎邀请她来的。真累人，真吵，但克拉丽莎邀请了她。因此她才来的。他俩住在伦敦真可惜——理查德与克拉丽莎。即使为克拉丽莎的健康着想，也是在乡下安居好些。但克拉丽莎老是热衷于交际圈。","Clarissa had asked her.It was tiring; it was noisy; but Clarissa had asked her.So she had come.It was a pity that they lived in London—Richard and Clarissa.If only for Clarissa’s health it would have been better to live in the country.But Clarissa had always been fond of society."
"“他去过缅甸。”克拉丽莎说道。","“He has been in Burma,” said Clarissa."
"哎呀！她不由得回想起查尔斯·达尔文对她描写缅甸兰花的一本小册子的评论。","Ah.She could not resist recalling what Charles Darwin had said about her little book on the orchids of Burma."
"（克拉丽莎得去告诉布鲁顿女士这一点。）","(Clarissa must speak to Lady Bruton.)"
"无疑这个小册子如今已被人忘掉，就是她描写缅甸兰花的书。不过到一八七零年之前出过三版，海伦娜姑妈告诉彼得。现在她记得他了。他在伯顿呆过（彼得·沃尔什却想起，那晚在客厅内，克拉丽莎邀约他去划船时，他一个字没说就离她而去）。","No doubt it was forgotten now, her book on the orchids of Burma, but it went into three editions before 1870, she told Peter.She remembered him now.He had been at Bourton (and he had left her, Peter Walsh remembered, without a word in the drawing-room that night when Clarissa had asked him to come boating)."
"“理查德对午餐会赞赏有加。”克拉丽莎给布鲁顿女士讲。","“Richard so much enjoyed his lunch party,” said Clarissa to Lady Bruton."
"“理查德是最合适的助手。”布鲁顿女士回答说，“他帮我写了封信呢。你还好吗？”","“Richard was the greatest possible help,” Lady Bruton replied.“He helped me to write a letter.And how are you?”"
"“哦，好极了！”克拉丽莎说道。（布鲁顿女士痛恨政治家的夫人们患病。）","“Oh, perfectly well!” said Clarissa.(Lady Bruton detested illness in the wives of politicians.)"
"“彼得·沃尔什也来啦！”布鲁顿女士说道。因为她向来不知道该跟克拉丽莎说些什么，虽然她喜欢这个女人。克拉丽莎拥有诸多美好的品质，可她俩毫无共通之处——她与克拉丽莎。要是理查德与一位魅力较小的女子结婚也许会更好，那妻子会对他的工作有更多帮助。他已丧失了在内阁做事的时机。“彼得·沃尔什在那里呢！”她说，一边与那讨人喜欢的坏东西握手，那才华横溢的家伙照理说会出名的，不过没有（老是与女人有纠葛）。当然，年迈的帕里小姐也在。奇妙的老妇人！","“And there’s Peter Walsh!” said Lady Bruton (for she could never think of anything to say to Clarissa; though she liked her.She had lots of fine qualities; but they had nothing in common—she and Clarissa.It might have been better if Richard had married a woman with less charm, who would have helped him more in his work.He had lost his chance of the Cabinet).“There’s Peter Walsh!” she said, shaking hands with that agreeable sinner, that very able fellow who should have made a name for himself but hadn’t (always in difficulties with women), and, of course, old Miss Parry.Wonderful old lady!"
"布鲁顿女士靠着帕里小姐的椅子边站着，像个掷弹兵的幽灵披着一身黑衣，请彼得·沃尔什去吃午饭。亲切，不过没闲聊一句，想不起任何印度的动植物。当然，她在印度呆过，曾在三位总督家里做过客，认为某些印度百姓是难得的好人。然而印度的境况真是个悲剧！首相刚告诉过她（年迈的帕里小姐裹着围巾缩作一团，毫不在乎首相刚跟她讲了什么），布鲁顿女士想要听听彼得·沃尔什的观点，由于他才从中心地带里过来，而她会请桑普森爵士与彼得会面，因为那个地方的愚蠢、甚至可以说是邪恶以及她自己是一名军人女儿这个事实使她晚上难以入睡。她如今是位老妇人了，用处不大了。不过她的房子、她的佣人、她的密友米利·布拉什——他还记得她吗？全都只等着她召唤——总之，只要能有所帮助。尽管布鲁顿女士从没说起过英国，然而这个男子汉的岛屿，这亲爱的、亲爱的土地已渗入了她的血液（尽管她没有读过莎士比亚）。如果有某个女人能戴头盔射箭，能率军进攻，能顽强不屈地、公正无私地统治蛮族，然后躺在教堂中盾形的徽章下（已经腐烂得没有了鼻子），或安息在某处原始小山坡上绿草丛生的古冢里，那这个女人即是米莉森特·布鲁顿。尽管受到性别、逻辑能力欠缺的阻碍（她发觉写封信给《泰晤士报》也办不到），她却总是念念不忘大英帝国，从与那披着铠甲的战争女神的联合中形成了她挺拔的身姿、稳健的举止。所以人们不能想象她死后会离开地球，以灵魂的某种形式徘徊在没有英国国旗飘扬的地区。即便在死者中，要她不做英国人——不，不！办不到！","Lady Bruton stood by Miss Parry’s chair, a spectral grenadier, draped in black, inviting Peter Walsh to lunch; cordial; but without small talk, remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of India.She had been there, of course; had stayed with three Viceroys; thought some of the Indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows; but what a tragedy it was—the state of India!The Prime Minister had just been telling her (old Miss Parry huddled up in her shawl, did not care what the Prime Minister had just been telling her), and Lady Bruton would like to have Peter Walsh’s opinion, he being fresh from the centre, and she would get Sir Sampson to meet him, for really it prevented her from sleeping at night, the folly of it, the wickedness she might say, being a soldier’s daughter.She was an old woman now, not good for much.But her house, her servants, her good friend Milly Brush—did he remember her?—were all there only asking to be used if—if they could be of help, in short.For she never spoke of England, but this isle of men, this dear, dear land, was in her blood (without reading Shakespeare), and if ever a woman could have worn the helmet and shot the arrow, could have led troops to attack, ruled with indomitable justice barbarian hordes and lain under a shield noseless in a church, or made a green grass mound on some primeval hillside, that woman was Millicent Bruton.Debarred by her sex and some truancy, too, of the logical faculty (she found it impossible to write a letter to the @Times@), she had the thought of Empire always at hand, and had acquired from her association with that armoured goddess her ramrod bearing, her robustness of demeanour, so that one could not figure her even in death parted from the earth or roaming territories over which, in some spiritual shape, the Union Jack had ceased to fly.To be not English even among the dead—no, no!Impossible!"
"但那是布鲁顿女士吗（她过去认得她）？那头发变得灰白的是彼得·沃尔什吗？罗塞特太太问自己（就是以前的萨莉·西顿）。这位无疑是年迈的帕里小姐——她在伯顿时遇到的脾气很坏的老姑妈。她从来也没忘记自己赤裸着在过道里奔跑，被帕里小姐喊了去！还有克拉丽莎！啊，克拉丽莎！萨莉抓住了她的手臂。","But was it Lady Bruton (whom she used to know)?Was it Peter Walsh grown grey?Lady Rosseter asked herself (who had been Sally Seton).It was old Miss Parry certainly—the old aunt who used to be so cross when she stayed at Bourton.Never should she forget running along the passage naked, and being sent for by Miss Parry!And Clarissa!oh Clarissa!Sally caught her by the arm."
"克拉丽莎在她们身旁停住了。","Clarissa stopped beside them."
"“但我不能呆了。”她说道，“我以后再来。等着我。”她边说边看着彼得和萨莉。她的意思是他们得等到所有人都离开了以后。","“But I can’t stay,” she said.“I shall come later.Wait,” she said, looking at Peter and Sally.They must wait, she meant, until all these people had gone."
"“我会回来的。”她说，看着她的老朋友——萨莉与彼得——他俩在握手，而萨莉必是想起了往事，正在笑。","“I shall come back,” she said, looking at her old friends, Sally and Peter, who were shaking hands, and Sally, remembering the past no doubt, was laughing."
"可她的声音失去了以前醉人的圆润，双眸也不如以前那样闪亮。当年她抽雪茄，她一丝不挂地在过道里奔跑着去拿海绵袋时，双眸多闪亮啊。当时埃伦·阿特金斯问道，倘若撞见一位绅士她该怎么办呀？可是每个人都原谅她。她从食物橱里偷鸡来吃，因为她晚上很饿。她在卧室里抽雪茄。她把一本贵重的书遗忘在平底船上。但每个人都爱她（可能父亲例外）。这是因为她的热忱、她的活力——她会作画，会写东西。村庄里的老妇人们至今从未忘记问候“你那身穿红色披风、看上去聪明伶俐的朋友”。在所有人中，萨莉只责怪休·惠特布雷德（他就在那里，她的老友休，在与那位葡萄牙大使说话）。因为她谈到女士应有选举权，他便在吸烟室亲吻她以示惩戒。粗俗男人的行径，她说道。克拉丽莎想起当时劝她别在全家祷告时谴责休——她是做得出的，她大胆、鲁莽，极其喜欢成为一切戏剧性场面的中心。克拉丽莎过去常常认为她这样必然以极为悲惨的结局收场。她会死掉，她会受到折磨。但她却结婚了，真是意想不到，嫁了个纽扣上别有大花的秃头男人。据说他在曼彻斯特拥有几家棉纺厂。她还有五个儿子！","But her voice was wrung of its old ravishing richness; her eyes not aglow as they used to be, when she smoked cigars, when she ran down the passage to fetch her sponge bag, without a stitch of clothing on her, and Ellen Atkins asked, What if the gentlemen had met her?But everybody forgave her.She stole a chicken from the larder because she was hungry in the night; she smoked cigars in her bedroom; she left a priceless book in the punt.But everybody adored her (except perhaps Papa).It was her warmth; her vitality—she would paint, she would write.Old women in the village never to this day forgot to ask after “your friend in the red cloak who seemed so bright.”She accused Hugh Whitbread, of all people (and there he was, her old friend Hugh, talking to the Portuguese Ambassador), of kissing her in the smoking-room to punish her for saying that women should have votes.Vulgar men did, she said.And Clarissa remembered having to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers—which she was capable of doing with her daring, her recklessness, her melodramatic love of being the centre of everything and creating scenes, and it was bound, Clarissa used to think, to end in some awful tragedy; her death; her martyrdom; instead of which she had married, quite unexpectedly, a bald man with a large buttonhole who owned, it was said, cotton mills at Manchester.And she had five boys!"
"她与彼得坐在一起了。他俩在聊天，这场景看起来是多么熟悉——他俩应该聊天。他们会聊起往事。她与这俩人分享的过往甚至比理查德更多。那花园、树林、客厅的墙纸、垫子的味道；老约瑟夫·布赖特科普夫五音不全地唱着勃拉姆斯的曲子。萨莉必定永远是这一切的一部分，彼得必定也是。但她要告别他俩了。布拉德肖一家也在，这俩人是她厌恶的。她必须走到布拉德肖太太身边（布拉德肖太太穿着一身银灰色礼服，像一头海狮在水池边力求平衡，吼叫着渴望得到邀请和公爵夫人们见面，一个典型的成功男人的太太），她必须走到布拉德肖太太身边并且说……","She and Peter had settled down together.They were talking: it seemed so familiar—that they should be talking.They would discuss the past.With the two of them (more even than with Richard) she shared her past; the garden; the trees; old Joseph Breitkopf singing Brahms without any voice; the drawing-room wallpaper; the smell of the mats.A part of this Sally must always be; Peter must always be.But she must leave them.There were the Bradshaws, whom she disliked.She must go up to Lady Bradshaw (in grey and silver, balancing like a sea-lion at the edge of its tank, barking for invitations, Duchesses, the typical successful man’s wife), she must go up to Lady Bradshaw and say..."
"可布拉德肖太太先发制人。","But Lady Bradshaw anticipated her."
"“亲爱的达洛维夫人，我们这么晚才来，实在没勇气进门呢。”布拉德肖太太说。","“We are shockingly late, dear Mrs. Dalloway, we hardly dared to come in,” she said."
"长着一头灰白头发、一双蓝色眼睛的仪表出众的威廉爵士说道，的确来得太晚了。他们实在经受不住晚宴的诱惑。他也许正在与理查德谈论那项议案，他们想在下议院通过这项议案。为什么看到他与理查德说话会让她感到恶心？他看起来符合他的身份——一位名医。一个在自己的行业中绝对领先的男人，很有影响，颇为劳累。想想看他面对的是些什么病例吧——处于苦海最深处的人、濒临精神错乱的人、丈夫和妻子们。他不得不对非常棘手的难题做出决定。不过——她觉得人们不想让威廉爵士看到自己不开心。不行，不能被那人看到。","And Sir William, who looked very distinguished, with his grey hair and blue eyes, said yes; they had not been able to resist the temptation.He was talking to Richard about that Bill probably, which they wanted to get through the Commons.Why did the sight of him, talking to Richard, curl her up?He looked what he was, a great doctor.A man absolutely at the head of his profession, very powerful, rather worn.For think what cases came before him—people in the uttermost depths of misery; people on the verge of insanity; husbands and wives.He had to decide questions of appalling difficulty.Yet—what she felt was, one wouldn’t like Sir William to see one unhappy.No; not that man."
"“您儿子在伊顿还好吗？”她问候布拉德肖夫人。","“How is your son at Eton?” she asked Lady Bradshaw."
"布拉德肖太太说道，他刚错过了十一岁考试（过去在英格兰和威尔士的一种考试制度），因为患了腮腺炎。她觉得做父亲的甚至比儿子更担心。她说：“因为他父亲自己也只不过是个大男孩呢。”","He had just missed his eleven, said Lady Bradshaw, because of the mumps.His father minded even more than he did, she thought “being,” she said, “nothing but a great boy himself.”"
"克拉丽莎瞥了一下威廉爵士，他还在与理查德交谈。他看起来不像个男孩——丝毫不像个男孩。有一次，她曾跟某人去他那里就诊。他做得十分恰当，极其通情达理。可是上帝呀——再次来到街上是多么让人轻松啊！她想起来候诊室里有个可怜的病人在抽泣。但她不清楚到底是什么——关于威廉爵士，她到底讨厌他什么。唯有理查德同意她的观点：“讨厌他的品味，讨厌他的气味。”但是他非常有能力。他俩在讨论这个议案。威廉爵士提到一个病例，同时压低了声音。这与他所谈及的弹震症有关系。议案里一定要有相应的规定。","Clarissa looked at Sir William, talking to Richard.He did not look like a boy—not in the least like a boy.She had once gone with some one to ask his advice.He had been perfectly right; extremely sensible.But Heavens—what a relief to get out to the street again!There was some poor wretch sobbing, she remembered, in the waiting-room.But she did not know what it was—about Sir William; what exactly she disliked.Only Richard agreed with her, “didn’t like his taste, didn’t like his smell.”But he was extraordinarily able.They were talking about this Bill.Some case, Sir William was mentioning, lowering his voice.It had its bearing upon what he was saying about the deferred effects of shell shock.There must be some provision in the Bill."
"布拉德肖太太（可怜的傻瓜——你并不讨厌她）压低了声音，将达洛维夫人引到共同的女性特质、对自己丈夫的卓越品质的共同自豪感、以及他们工作过度劳累的可悲倾向的庇佑之下，低声说道：“我们正要出发时，有人给我丈夫打电话，一个非常悲惨的病例。一个青年（威廉爵士正在告诉达洛维先生的就是这事）自杀了。他在部队当过兵。”啊！克拉丽莎心想，在我宴会的中间，死神闯入了。","Sinking her voice, drawing Mrs. Dalloway into the shelter of a common femininity, a common pride in the illustrious qualities of husbands and their sad tendency to overwork, Lady Bradshaw (poor goose—one didn’t dislike her) murmured how, “just as we were starting, my husband was called up on the telephone, a very sad case.A young man (that is what Sir William is telling Mr. Dalloway) had killed himself.He had been in the army.”Oh! thought Clarissa, in the middle of my party, here’s death, she thought."
"她向前走去，进入首相与布鲁顿女士方才迈入的那间小屋里。大概那里还有人在。可一个人也没有。椅子上仍然留有首相与布鲁顿女士坐过的痕迹。她是谦恭地侧过身去，他则正正当当地坐着，非常威严。他俩在谈印度的情况。一个人也没有。宴会的辉煌消失殆尽了，她穿着华丽的礼服一个人走进这房间真是太怪异了。","She went on, into the little room where the Prime Minister had gone with Lady Bruton.Perhaps there was somebody there.But there was nobody.The chairs still kept the impress of the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton, she turned deferentially, he sitting four-square, authoritatively.They had been talking about India.There was nobody.The party’s splendour fell to the floor, so strange it was to come in alone in her finery."
"布拉德肖夫妇凭什么在她的宴会里说到死亡？一个青年自杀了。而他俩竟在她的宴会里说起这事——布拉德肖夫妇提到了死亡。那青年自杀了——可怎样死的？她猛然听闻一个意外事故时，她的身体总是先要经历一遍。她的裙子着火了，她的身子被烧伤了。那青年从窗户跳了下去。地面突然变高，锈蚀的尖钉刺穿了他，跌跌撞撞，遍体鳞伤。他躺在地上，脑子里发出砰、砰、砰的声音，接着在一团漆黑中窒息。这就是她眼前浮现的景象。但他为什么要这样？而布拉德肖夫妇竟敢在她的宴会里说起这事！","What business had the Bradshaws to talk of death at her party?A young man had killed himself.And they talked of it at her party—the Bradshaws, talked of death.He had killed himself—but how?Always her body went through it first, when she was told, suddenly, of an accident; her dress flamed, her body burnt.He had thrown himself from a window.Up had flashed the ground; through him, blundering, bruising, went the rusty spikes.There he lay with a thud, thud, thud in his brain, and then a suffocation of blackness.So she saw it.But why had he done it?And the Bradshaws talked of it at her party!"
"她过去有一回把一枚先令扔瑟彭泰恩湖里，就再没扔过其他任何东西。但那青年却把生命扔掉了。他们继续活着（她得回去，屋里还是挤得满满的，不停地有宾客到来）。他们（她整天在想伯顿、彼得、萨莉），他们会变老。有一样东西是重要的。在她自己的生活中，这样东西被闲聊包围，被破坏，渐渐模糊，每天都在堕落、谎言和闲聊中一点一点地消失。但是他保存了这样东西。死亡是个挑战。死亡是交流的一种尝试。人们觉得不可能接近那神秘的、触摸不到的中心。亲密变得疏远，狂欢退却，只剩下自己形单影只。死亡里有着拥抱。","She had once thrown a shilling into the Serpentine, never anything more.But he had flung it away.They went on living (she would have to go back; the rooms were still crowded; people kept on coming).They (all day she had been thinking of Bourton, of Peter, of Sally), they would grow old.A thing there was that mattered; a thing, wreathed about with chatter, defaced, obscured in her own life, let drop every day in corruption, lies, chatter.This he had preserved.Death was defiance.Death was an attempt to communicate; people feeling the impossibility of reaching the centre which, mystically, evaded them; closeness drew apart; rapture faded, one was alone.There was an embrace in death."
"但是这个自杀的年轻人——他是怀着珍贵的一切纵身一跳的吗？“倘若此刻就要死，此刻即是最幸福的。”有一回她穿着白衣下楼的时候自言自语道。","But this young man who had killed himself—had he plunged holding his treasure?“If it were now to die, ’twere now to be most happy,” she had said to herself once, coming down in white."
"也许还有诗人与思想家。设想他曾经有过那种激情，还去找过威廉·布拉德肖爵士——一位名医，可对她而言他有着说不清楚的邪恶，没有性也没欲望，对女性彬彬有礼，可又会干些不可名状的骇人听闻之事，压制你的灵魂，正是这点——倘若那青年去找过威廉爵士，而威廉爵士凭自己的能力留给他那样的印象，那么难道那青年不会说（现在她确实是这样感觉的）生活变得难以忍受，他们，像那医生之流的人让生活变得难以忍受吗？","Or there were the poets and thinkers.Suppose he had had that passion, and had gone to Sir William Bradshaw, a great doctor yet to her obscurely evil, without sex or lust, extremely polite to women, but capable of some indescribable outrage—forcing your soul, that was it—if this young man had gone to him, and Sir William had impressed him, like that, with his power, might he not then have said (indeed she felt it now), Life is made intolerable; they make life intolerable, men like that?"
"还有（她仅在今天早晨才感到）那种恐惧，难以抗拒的无能之感，父母将这生命赋予你，要活到生命的最后一刻，要平静地走过生命之路，她内心深处充满莫大的恐惧。即便现在，要不是理查德惯常在那里读《泰晤士报》，以便让她可以像一只小鸟一样缩成一团，渐渐恢复活力，发出快乐无比的呼喊，在枝条间磨蹭，一个接着一个，她必定早死了。不过那青年自杀了。","Then (she had felt it only this morning) there was the terror; the overwhelming incapacity, one’s parents giving it into one’s hands, this life, to be lived to the end, to be walked with serenely; there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear.Even now, quite often if Richard had not been there reading the @Times@, so that she could crouch like a bird and gradually revive, send roaring up that immeasurable delight, rubbing stick to stick, one thing with another, she must have perished.But that young man had killed himself."
"不知为何，这是她的灾难——她的羞耻。目睹着这里一个男人、那里一个女人接连沉沦、消失在这漆黑的深渊里，而她却被迫穿上晚礼服站在这里，这是对她的惩罚。她曾耍过阴谋，她曾小偷小盗过。她从来就不是个完全可钦佩的人。她曾想要成功。如贝克斯伯勒太太等人一样。而有一回贝克斯伯勒太太曾在伯顿的阳台上漫步。","Somehow it was her disaster—her disgrace.It was her punishment to see sink and disappear here a man, there a woman, in this profound darkness, and she forced to stand here in her evening dress.She had schemed; she had pilfered.She was never wholly admirable.She had wanted success.Lady Bexborough and the rest of it.And once she had walked on the terrace at Bourton."
"都是理查德的功劳，她从未这样幸福过。一切都不嫌太慢，一切都不能永存。没什么乐趣能与这种感觉媲美，她心想，一边摆正椅子，将书架上的一本书推进去。她已经结束了青春的喜悦，沉迷于生活的过程之中，在日出日落中惊喜地发现了生活的幸福。在伯顿的时候，当人们都在聊天时，她曾经很多次去仰望苍穹，或是在吃饭的时候，从人们肩膀的缝隙中瞥见一线天空。在伦敦，她无法入睡时，便去眺望天空。她走向窗口。","It was due to Richard; she had never been so happy.Nothing could be slow enough; nothing last too long.No pleasure could equal, she thought, straightening the chairs, pushing in one book on the shelf, this having done with the triumphs of youth, lost herself in the process of living, to find it, with a shock of delight, as the sun rose, as the day sank.Many a time had she gone, at Bourton when they were all talking, to look at the sky; or seen it between people’s shoulders at dinner; seen it in London when she could not sleep.She walked to the window."
"这乡下的天空、这威斯敏斯特的天空有着她自己的某种东西在里面，虽然这个想法有些傻气。她拨开窗帘，向外看着。噢，可真令人惊讶！在对面屋子里的那位老妇人正直勾勾地盯着她！她就要上床了。还有那天空。她原本以为天空会是一个肃穆的天空，会是一个昏暗的天空。她转过美丽的脸颊。可瞧那里——天空面如死灰，一堆堆巨大的云团在空中快速掠过，越变越细。这一切对她而言是新鲜的。一定是起风了。那对面屋子的老妇人就要上床了。她陶醉地观察着那个老妇人。她走来走去，穿过房间，来到窗前。她能瞧见自己吗？人们还在客厅里朗笑欢呼时，看着老妇人十分平静地上床去真令人陶醉。现在她拉下了百叶窗。钟开始敲了。那青年自杀了。可她没有怜悯他。钟敲响报时了，一声、两声、三声，她没有怜悯他，这一切都在继续着。看！老妇人熄灯了！整个宅子此时一片漆黑，这一切继续着，她反复说着，想起了这句话，不用再怕炙热的骄阳。她得回到客人们中去。可是这是一个多奇妙的晚上啊！她觉得自己在某种程度上像极了他——那自杀了的青年。她很高兴他这样干了，丢掉了生命。钟正在敲。如铅般沉重的声波一圈圈消逝在空中。他让她感受到美，让她感到有趣。可她得回去了。她得打起精神。她得寻找萨莉和彼得。于是她从小屋进入客厅。","It held, foolish as the idea was, something of her own in it, this country sky, this sky above Westminster.She parted the curtains; she looked.Oh, but how surprising!—in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her!She was going to bed.And the sky.It will be a solemn sky, she had thought, it will be a dusky sky, turning away its cheek in beauty.But there it was—ashen pale, raced over quickly by tapering vast clouds.It was new to her.The wind must have risen.She was going to bed, in the room opposite.It was fascinating to watch her, moving about, that old lady, crossing the room, coming to the window.Could she see her?It was fascinating, with people still laughing and shouting in the drawing-room, to watch that old woman, quite quietly, going to bed.She pulled the blind now.The clock began striking.The young man had killed himself; but she did not pity him; with the clock striking the hour, one, two, three, she did not pity him, with all this going on.There! the old lady had put out her light!the whole house was dark now with this going on, she repeated, and the words came to her, Fear no more the heat of the sun.She must go back to them.But what an extraordinary night!She felt somehow very like him—the young man who had killed himself.She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away.The clock was striking.The leaden circles dissolved in the air.He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun.But she must go back.She must assemble.She must find Sally and Peter.And she came in from the little room."
"“但是克拉丽莎在哪里？”彼得说。他跟萨莉都在沙发上坐着。相识这么些年后他对她真叫不出“罗塞特太太”。“那女人去哪里了？”他问道。“克拉丽莎在哪里？”","“But where is Clarissa?” said Peter.He was sitting on the sofa with Sally.(After all these years he really could not call her “Lady Rosseter.”) “Where’s the woman gone to?” he asked.“Where’s Clarissa?”"
"萨莉推测，彼得对此也这样认为，有大人物来了，政客之类，这类人他俩都不知道，除了在书画报刊上看到过以外，而克拉丽莎必须友好地招呼，得寒暄几句。克拉丽莎与那类人在一起吧。但理查德·达洛维不是内阁成员。萨莉猜想他不是个成功人士吧？至于她自己，几乎从不读报。她有时发现理查德的名字见报了。可是——哎，她过着十足的独居生活，克拉丽莎会说是在荒郊野外，她是在商业巨贾、工业大亨中间，毕竟是些干了一番事业的男人。她也做了一些事啊！","Sally supposed, and so did Peter for the matter of that, that there were people of importance, politicians, whom neither of them knew unless by sight in the picture papers, whom Clarissa had to be nice to, had to talk to.She was with them.Yet there was Richard Dalloway not in the Cabinet.He hadn’t been a success, Sally supposed?For herself, she scarcely ever read the papers.She sometimes saw his name mentioned.But then—well, she lived a very solitary life, in the wilds, Clarissa would say, among great merchants, great manufacturers, men, after all, who did things.She had done things too!"
"“我生了五个男孩！”萨莉对彼得说。","“I have five sons!” she told him."
"上帝，上帝啊，她身上发生了多大的改变啊！母性的柔情，母性的自我主义。彼得记得上回他俩见面时，是在月光映照下的花椰菜丛里。她那时用带文学色彩的措辞说片片叶子“如粗犷的青铜”，还采下一朵玫瑰。在那个十分糟糕的晚上，发生喷泉边的事情后，他被逼着踱来踱去。他还得赶半夜开的火车呢。老天呀，他哭了！","Lord, Lord, what a change had come over her!the softness of motherhood; its egotism too.Last time they met, Peter remembered, had been among the cauliflowers in the moonlight, the leaves “like rough bronze” she had said, with her literary turn; and she had picked a rose.She had marched him up and down that awful night, after the scene by the fountain; he was to catch the midnight train.Heavens, he had wept!"
"那是他的老把戏，打开折刀，萨莉心想，他兴奋时总是将刀打开又合上。彼得·沃尔什爱着克拉丽莎时，跟她关系也十分、十分密切，还有那次在午餐上为了理查德·达洛维发生的槽糕而可笑的争吵。她曾称呼理查德为“威克姆”。为什么不称呼理查德为“威克姆”？　克拉丽莎突然大怒！其实从此两人再也没遇到过，她与克拉丽莎，在过去的十年里可能相见了至多六次。而彼得·沃尔什则去了印度。她隐约耳闻到他有过一次不幸的婚姻。她不清楚他是否有孩子，又不便问他，因为他变了。他看起来相当干瘪，不过她感到他比以前友好了，她对他怀着真挚的情感，因为他与自己的青春是有联系的，她还保留着一本艾米丽·勃朗特的小说吗？是他送她的，他想必是要写作吧？那时候他是要写作的。","That was his old trick, opening a pocket-knife, thought Sally, always opening and shutting a knife when he got excited.They had been very, very intimate, she and Peter Walsh, when he was in love with Clarissa, and there was that dreadful, ridiculous scene over Richard Dalloway at lunch.She had called Richard “Wickham.”Why not call Richard “Wickham”?Clarissa had flared up!and indeed they had never seen each other since, she and Clarissa, not more than half a dozen times perhaps in the last ten years.And Peter Walsh had gone off to India, and she had heard vaguely that he had made an unhappy marriage, and she didn’t know whether he had any children, and she couldn’t ask him, for he had changed.He was rather shrivelled-looking, but kinder, she felt, and she had a real affection for him, for he was connected with her youth, and she still had a little Emily Bront?he had given her, and he was to write, surely?In those days he was to write."
"“你写了没？”她问他道，一边伸开手，她结实而线条优美的手搁在膝上，他记得她的这个姿势。","“Have you written?” she asked him, spreading her hand, her firm and shapely hand, on her knee in a way he recalled."
"“一个字都没写！”彼得·沃尔什说道。她大笑。","“Not a word!” said Peter Walsh, and she laughed."
"她依然很迷人，依然是个人物，萨莉·西顿。但这位罗塞特又是谁？他婚礼那天在衣服上佩了两朵山茶花——那就是彼得对他所有的了解。“他们有许许多多佣人，好几英里长的温室。”克拉丽莎写信给他讲，类似那样的话。萨莉轰然大笑，对此表示承认。","She was still attractive, still a personage, Sally Seton.But who was this Rosseter?He wore two camellias on his wedding day—that was all Peter knew of him.“They have myriads of servants, miles of conservatories,” Clarissa wrote; something like that.Sally owned it with a shout of laughter."
"“没错，我每年收入有一万英镑。”是缴税之前还是之后的数目，她想不起来了，因为是丈夫为她做了这一切。“你必须跟他见见，”她说道，“你会喜欢他的。”","“Yes, I have ten thousand a year”—whether before the tax was paid or after, she couldn’t remember, for her husband, “whom you must meet,” she said, “whom you would like,” she said, did all that for her."
"而萨莉过去老是衣衫褴褛。她为了去伯顿把她外祖母的一只戒指典当了，这是玛丽·安托瓦内特赠与她曾祖父的。","And Sally used to be in rags and tatters.She had pawned her grandmother’s ring which Marie Antoinette had given her great-grandfather to come to Bourton."
"哦，是的，萨莉记得。她仍珍藏着那枚戒指，镶着红宝石的玛丽·安托瓦妮特赠与她曾祖父的戒指。当年她从没有属于自己的一分钱，到伯顿去总是得拼命地节省好久。可到伯顿去对她意义非凡——她相信这可以让她心智健全，她在家很不快乐。不过所有这些都成了往事——都结束了，她说道。而帕里先生死了，帕里小姐还在世。他一生从未如此震惊过！彼得说。他十分肯定她去世了。萨莉猜想那桩婚姻是幸福的吧？而那位十分俊美、十分镇静的年轻女子就是伊丽莎白，就在那里，靠着窗帘，身穿红色礼服。","Oh yes, Sally remembered; she had it still, a ruby ring which Marie Antoinette had given her great-grandfather.She never had a penny to her name in those days, and going to Bourton always meant some frightful pinch.But going to Bourton had meant so much to her—had kept her sane, she believed, so unhappy had she been at home.But that was all a thing of the past—all over now, she said.And Mr. Parry was dead; and Miss Parry was still alive.Never had he had such a shock in his life! said Peter.He had been quite certain she was dead.And the marriage had been, Sally supposed, a success?And that very handsome, very self-possessed young woman was Elizabeth, over there, by the curtains, in red."
"（她似一棵白杨，似一条溪流，似一株风信子，威利·蒂特科姆正在想。噢，在乡间做自己喜欢的事该有多好！她听得见她可怜的狗在嚎叫，伊丽莎白能确定。）她一点都不像克拉丽莎，彼得·沃尔什说道。　","(She was like a poplar, she was like a river, she was like a hyacinth, Willie Titcomb was thinking.Oh how much nicer to be in the country and do what she liked!She could hear her poor dog howling, Elizabeth was certain.) She was not a bit like Clarissa, Peter Walsh said."
"“噢，克拉丽莎！”萨莉说道。","“Oh, Clarissa!” said Sally."
"萨莉感到的仅仅是这个。她欠下了克拉丽莎一大笔债。她俩是朋友，并非泛泛之交，是密友。她眼前依然浮现克拉丽莎一袭白衣，手中捧着鲜花在屋里走着的样子——至今烟草作物仍令萨莉想到伯顿。不过——彼得懂吗？克拉丽莎缺了点什么。缺什么呢？她有魅力，她有非凡的魅力。但坦率地说（萨莉觉得彼得是个老朋友了，真正的朋友——他不在国内有什么关系？隔得远有什么关系？她以前常想写信给他，但写好又撕掉，不过她觉得他会明白的。因为有些事不必说也能明白，就像一个人意识到正在渐渐变老，而她的确老了。那个下午她去了伊顿探望儿子们，他们患上腮腺炎），那么坦率地说，克拉丽莎怎么会做出这种事？与理查德·达洛维结了婚。一个运动爱好者，一个仅仅在乎狗的男人。他走进房间时真的会散发出马厩的味道。还有这整个宴会？她挥着手。","What Sally felt was simply this.She had owed Clarissa an enormous amount.They had been friends, not acquaintances, friends, and she still saw Clarissa all in white going about the house with her hands full of flowers—to this day tobacco plants made her think of Bourton.But—did Peter understand?—she lacked something.Lacked what was it?She had charm; she had extraordinary charm.But to be frank (and she felt that Peter was an old friend, a real friend—did absence matter?did distance matter?She had often wanted to write to him, but torn it up, yet felt he understood, for people understand without things being said, as one realises growing old, and old she was, had been that afternoon to see her sons at Eton, where they had the mumps), to be quite frank then, how could Clarissa have done it?—married Richard Dalloway?a sportsman, a man who cared only for dogs.Literally, when he came into the room he smelt of the stables.And then all this?She waved her hand."
"那不是休·惠特布雷德，身穿白色马甲慢悠悠地走过去，迟钝、肥胖、盲目、无视一切，除自大与舒适以外。","Hugh Whitbread it was, strolling past in his white waistcoat, dim, fat, blind, past everything he looked, except self-esteem and comfort."
"“他不会理睬我们的。”萨莉说道，而她真的鼓不起勇气——那就是休！可敬的休！","“He’s not going to recognise US,” said Sally, and really she hadn’t the courage—so that was Hugh!the admirable Hugh!"
"“他在做什么？”她向彼得问道。","“And what does he do?” she asked Peter."
"他在为国王擦靴子，或是在温莎宫中清点酒瓶，彼得告诉她。彼得仍然伶牙俐齿！可萨莉一定得说实话，彼得说道。就是那次吻，休的吻。","He blacked the King’s boots or counted bottles at Windsor, Peter told her.Peter kept his sharp tongue still!But Sally must be frank, Peter said.That kiss now, Hugh’s."
"碰了一下嘴唇，她向他保证，是一天晚上在吸烟室发生的。她一怒之下径直走向克拉丽莎。休不会这样做的！克拉丽莎说道，可敬的休啊！休的短袜一概是她曾看到过的最美的——现在看看他的晚礼服吧。完美极了！他有孩子吗？","On the lips, she assured him, in the smoking-room one evening.She went straight to Clarissa in a rage.Hugh didn’t do such things!Clarissa said, the admirable Hugh!Hugh’s socks were without exception the most beautiful she had ever seen—and now his evening dress.Perfect!And had he children?"
"“这个房间人人都有六个儿子在伊顿。”彼得告诉她，除了他自己。他一个儿子也没有，谢天谢地。无儿、无女、无妻。嗯，他看上去并不介意，萨莉说道。他看上去比其他任何人都年轻，她心想。","“Everybody in the room has six sons at Eton,” Peter told her, except himself.He, thank God, had none.No sons, no daughters, no wife.Well, he didn’t seem to mind, said Sally.He looked younger, she thought, than any of them."
"彼得说，不过像那样就结婚从很多方面来讲是件蠢事。“她是个十足的笨蛋。”他说。不过他又说：“我俩度过了一段美好的日子。”然而那是怎么回事啊？萨莉有些疑惑，他是什么意思呢？认识他却连他的一件事也不了解，这多么奇怪。他是由于骄傲才这样说的吗？十分可能，因为终究这会令他难堪（尽管他是一个怪人，有几分怪相，但绝非一个普通人），他这样的年龄还没成家，没有归宿，想必是寂寞的。可他一定要到他们家住上几个星期。他当然会来的。他会喜欢与他们住在一起。就这样提起了这件事。这些年来达洛维一家一次也没去过。萨莉一家多次邀请他们。克拉丽莎（当然是克拉丽莎的原因）不肯来。这是因为，萨莉说道，克拉丽莎骨子里是个势利小人——人们必须认同这点，一个势利小人。她们之间的隔阂正是因为那一点，萨莉坚信。克拉丽莎觉得萨莉同地位低的人结了婚，因为她丈夫——她对此很自豪——是矿工的儿子。他们拥有的每个便士都是他挣来的。他年幼时（她的声音在发抖）就抗过大麻袋。","But it had been a silly thing to do, in many ways, Peter said, to marry like that; “a perfect goose she was,” he said, but, he said, “we had a splendid time of it,” but how could that be?Sally wondered; what did he mean?and how odd it was to know him and yet not know a single thing that had happened to him.And did he say it out of pride?Very likely, for after all it must be galling for him (though he was an oddity, a sort of sprite, not at all an ordinary man), it must be lonely at his age to have no home, nowhere to go to.But he must stay with them for weeks and weeks.Of course he would; he would love to stay with them, and that was how it came out.All these years the Dalloways had never been once.Time after time they had asked them.Clarissa (for it was Clarissa of course) would not come.For, said Sally, Clarissa was at heart a snob—one had to admit it, a snob.And it was that that was between them, she was convinced.Clarissa thought she had married beneath her, her husband being—she was proud of it—a miner’s son.Every penny they had he had earned.As a little boy (her voice trembled) he had carried great sacks."
"（她会如此不停地一个小时接一个小时地讲下去，彼得感到。丈夫是矿工的儿子。人们认为萨莉同地位低的人结了婚。她有了五个儿子，还有其他什么——植物、绣球花、紫丁香，从不在苏伊士运河北面生长的、相当相当稀罕的木槿百合。可是她呢，在曼彻斯特附近的一个郊区雇了一个园丁，种了很多坛这种百合，真的很多坛！现在克拉丽莎躲过了这一切，她原本也不是母性很强的人。）","(And so she would go on, Peter felt, hour after hour; the miner’s son; people thought she had married beneath her; her five sons; and what was the other thing—plants, hydrangeas, syringas, very, very rare hibiscus lilies that never grow north of the Suez Canal, but she, with one gardener in a suburb near Manchester, had beds of them, positively beds!Now all that Clarissa had escaped, unmaternal as she was.)"
"她是个势利小人？不错，从很多方面来讲都是。她在哪里，这段时间到哪里去了？天色渐晚。","A snob was she?Yes, in many ways.Where was she, all this time?It was getting late."
"“但是，”萨莉说道，“当我听说克拉丽莎将要举行宴会时，我感到自己非来不可——得与她再见一面（而我就在维多利亚街住，几乎是门挨门的近邻）。因此我就不请自来了。可是，”她小声说，“请务必告诉我。这是谁？”","“Yet,” said Sally, “when I heard Clarissa was giving a party, I felt I couldn’t NOT come—must see her again (and I’m staying in Victoria Street, practically next door).So I just came without an invitation.But,” she whispered, “tell me, do.Who is this?”"
"这是希尔伯里夫人，正找门呢。因为天色渐晚！她咕哝着天色越来越晚，人们都散去时，就能发现老朋友了，在静谧的角落中，最美丽的景象。她问，他们知道他们身处一个迷人的花园中吗？灯光、树丛、美妙的波光粼粼的湖、天空。只不过是几盏彩色小灯，克拉丽莎·达洛维曾经说过，就在后花园里！可她就是个魔术师！把它变成一个公园了……她不清楚一些人的名字，不过她了解他们是朋友，没有名字的朋友，没有歌词的歌向来是最好的。不过这里有那么多门，如此出乎意料的地方，她找不到出口了。","It was Mrs. Hilbery, looking for the door.For how late it was getting!And, she murmured, as the night grew later, as people went, one found old friends; quiet nooks and corners; and the loveliest views.Did they know, she asked, that they were surrounded by an enchanted garden?Lights and trees and wonderful gleaming lakes and the sky.Just a few fairy lamps, Clarissa Dalloway had said, in the back garden!But she was a magician!It was a park....And she didn’t know their names, but friends she knew they were, friends without names, songs without words, always the best.But there were so many doors, such unexpected places, she could not find her way."
"“希尔伯里老夫人。”彼得说道，可那边的是谁？一晚上都站在窗帘边的那位女士，沉默不语。他认得她的面孔，把她与伯顿联系了起来。想必她是曾坐在窗边那张大桌子旁裁剪内衣的人吧？戴维森，是她的名字吗？","“Old Mrs. Hilbery,” said Peter; but who was that?that lady standing by the curtain all the evening, without speaking?He knew her face; connected her with Bourton.Surely she used to cut up underclothes at the large table in the window?Davidson, was that her name?"
"“哦，那就是埃莉·亨德森吧。”萨莉说道。克拉丽莎待她真的太刻薄了。她是克拉丽莎的堂姐妹，相当贫困。克拉丽莎待人真是刻薄。","“Oh, that is Ellie Henderson,” said Sally.Clarissa was really very hard on her.She was a cousin, very poor.Clarissa WAS hard on people."
"她是很刻薄，彼得说道。不过，萨莉说——她说话时情绪激动、热情奔涌，彼得过去喜欢她这个特点，不过现在则有些畏惧，她的情感也许会太过外露——克拉丽莎对待朋友多慷慨呀！这是多么难能可贵的品质。她有时在晚上或是圣诞节，合计自己拥有的幸福时，会把与克拉丽莎的友谊放在首位。当时她俩还年轻，这就是原因。克拉丽莎天真无邪，这就是原因。彼得则认为她多愁善感。她的确如此。因为萨莉渐渐觉得唯一值得一提的就是这个——内心感受。聪明是可笑的。人应该仅仅说出自己的感觉。","She was rather, said Peter.Yet, said Sally, in her emotional way, with a rush of that enthusiasm which Peter used to love her for, yet dreaded a little now, so effusive she might become—how generous to her friends Clarissa was!and what a rare quality one found it, and how sometimes at night or on Christmas Day, when she counted up her blessings, she put that friendship first.They were young; that was it.Clarissa was pure-hearted; that was it.Peter would think her sentimental.So she was.For she had come to feel that it was the only thing worth saying—what one felt.Cleverness was silly.One must say simply what one felt."
"“但我不清楚，”彼得·沃尔什说道，“我有什么感觉。”","“But I do not know,” said Peter Walsh, “what I feel.”"
"彼得真可怜，萨莉心想。克拉丽莎为什么不来跟他们聊聊？他渴望的就是跟她聊聊。她清楚这个。他一心仅仅念着克拉丽莎，于是就坐立不安地摆弄刀。","Poor Peter, thought Sally.Why did not Clarissa come and talk to them?That was what he was longing for.She knew it.All the time he was thinking only of Clarissa, and was fidgeting with his knife."
"他不觉得生活是简单的，彼得说道。他与克拉丽莎之间的关系也不简单。这种关系破坏了他的生活，他说。（他俩一直亲密得很——他与萨莉·西顿，不讲出来是荒唐的。）一个人无法两次陷入爱情，他说。那她有什么可说的？然而，曾经恋爱过比没恋爱过的好（但他会觉得她多愁善感——他曾经相当尖锐）。他必须来曼彻斯特和他们住在一起。那是一定的，他说道。那是一定的。他会喜欢和他们住在一起，等他在伦敦一办完要办的事情就去。","He had not found life simple, Peter said.His relations with Clarissa had not been simple.It had spoilt his life, he said.(They had been so intimate—he and Sally Seton, it was absurd not to say it.) One could not be in love twice, he said.And what could she say?Still, it is better to have loved (but he would think her sentimental—he used to be so sharp).He must come and stay with them in Manchester.That is all very true, he said.All very true.He would love to come and stay with them, directly he had done what he had to do in London."
"克拉丽莎对他的爱胜过一直以来对理查德的爱。萨莉确信那一点。","And Clarissa had cared for him more than she had ever cared for Richard.Sally was positive of that."
"“不、不、不！”彼得说道（萨莉本不应那样说——她讲得过火了）。那好心的人——在屋子的另一端，侃侃而谈，与寻常一样，亲爱的老朋友理查德。他在跟谁在说话？萨莉问，那位仪表堂堂的男人是谁？她这样活在荒郊野外，怀着无止境的好奇心要认识陌生人。但彼得不认识那人。他不喜欢那人的模样，大概是个内阁大臣吧，他说道。在他们所有人里，他认为理查德最出色，他说——最公正无私。","“No, no, no!” said Peter (Sally should not have said that—she went too far).That good fellow—there he was at the end of the room, holding forth, the same as ever, dear old Richard.Who was he talking to?Sally asked, that very distinguished-looking man?Living in the wilds as she did, she had an insatiable curiosity to know who people were.But Peter did not know.He did not like his looks, he said, probably a Cabinet Minister.Of them all, Richard seemed to him the best, he said—the most disinterested."
"“但他干了什么？”萨莉问。公益事业吧，她猜想。他与克拉丽莎在一起快乐吗？萨莉问道（她自己幸福极了）。因为她承认她对他们毫不了解，只是和人们惯常的做法一样匆匆下结论。因为即便每天一起生活的人，你又了解对方多少呢？她问。我们不都是囚犯吗？她曾读到一个极好的剧本，男主人公在囚室的墙上胡乱涂写，她觉得生活就是那样——人们在墙上胡乱涂写。她对人与人之间的关系绝望了（与人相处是那么困难），她常去自家花园中，从她的花那里获得男男女女从未给过她的安宁。但是不行，他并不喜爱卷心菜，他宁愿与人交往，彼得说道。那年轻人真的很漂亮，萨莉说，看着伊丽莎白穿过房间。克拉丽莎在她那个年龄时是多不一样啊！彼得能够明白她吗？她不愿张口说话。不大明白，尚未明白，彼得承认。她宛如一株百合花，萨莉说道，一株长在水池旁的百合花。不过彼得不同意萨莉说的我们一无所知。我们知道每一件事，他说道，至少他对每件事一清二楚。","“But what has he done?” Sally asked.Public work, she supposed.And were they happy together?Sally asked (she herself was extremely happy); for, she admitted, she knew nothing about them, only jumped to conclusions, as one does, for what can one know even of the people one lives with every day? she asked.Are we not all prisoners?She had read a wonderful play about a man who scratched on the wall of his cell, and she had felt that was true of life—one scratched on the wall.Despairing of human relationships (people were so difficult), she often went into her garden and got from her flowers a peace which men and women never gave her.But no; he did not like cabbages; he preferred human beings, Peter said.Indeed, the young are beautiful, Sally said, watching Elizabeth cross the room.How unlike Clarissa at her age!Could he make anything of her?She would not open her lips.Not much, not yet, Peter admitted.She was like a lily, Sally said, a lily by the side of a pool.But Peter did not agree that we know nothing.We know everything, he said; at least he did."
"萨莉低声说但那两个人，现在正走过来的那两个人（她真的必须要离开了，要是克拉丽莎不立即来的话），一直和理查德说话的这个仪表堂堂的男人和他相貌平凡的太太——你能对那类人了解多少？","But these two, Sally whispered, these two coming now (and really she must go, if Clarissa did not come soon), this distinguished-looking man and his rather common-looking wife who had been talking to Richard—what could one know about people like that?"
"“知道他俩是可恶的骗子。”彼得说，漫不经心地看着他们。他的话让萨莉放声大笑。","“That they’re damnable humbugs,” said Peter, looking at them casually.He made Sally laugh."
"可威廉·布拉德肖爵士在门口停下来欣赏一幅雕版画。他在画的角落里寻找雕刻家的名字。他的太太也在欣赏着。威廉·布拉德肖爵士对艺术兴趣浓厚。","But Sir William Bradshaw stopped at the door to look at a picture.He looked in the corner for the engraver’s name.His wife looked too.Sir William Bradshaw was so interested in art."
"一个人年轻时，彼得说道，太容易激动而无法看清人们。而今老了，准确地讲五十二岁了（萨莉从外表看来五十五了，她说道，不过她内心就如一位二十岁的女子），于是现在就成熟了，彼得说道，就能观察人、了解人，同时并没有丧失感受力，他说。不错，确实如此，萨莉说道。一年又一年，她的情感越来越深沉、热烈。彼得说，哎呀，也许情感在增强，但应当对这事感到开心——以他的经验来说，情感是会持续增强的。他在印度结识了某个人。他愿意告诉萨莉那女人的事。他想让萨莉认识她。她结过婚，彼得说道。她有两个幼小的子女。他们务必全都来到曼彻斯特，萨莉说道——他在他们离开前必须向她许诺。","When one was young, said Peter, one was too much excited to know people.Now that one was old, fifty-two to be precise (Sally was fifty-five, in body, she said, but her heart was like a girl’s of twenty); now that one was mature then, said Peter, one could watch, one could understand, and one did not lose the power of feeling, he said.No, that is true, said Sally.She felt more deeply, more passionately, every year.It increased, he said, alas, perhaps, but one should be glad of it—it went on increasing in his experience.There was some one in India.He would like to tell Sally about her.He would like Sally to know her.She was married, he said.She had two small children.They must all come to Manchester, said Sally—he must promise before they left."
"伊丽莎白来了，彼得说道，她感受到的还不到我们的一半，还没有呢。但是，萨莉说，看伊丽莎白走向她父亲的样子就知道他们父女间感情很深。她可以通过伊丽莎白朝她父亲走过去的样子感受到。","There’s Elizabeth, he said, she feels not half what we feel, not yet.But, said Sally, watching Elizabeth go to her father, one can see they are devoted to each other.She could feel it by the way Elizabeth went to her father."
"因为她父亲在站着与布拉德肖一家说话的时候，总是看着伊丽莎白，心想那个可爱的女孩是谁啊？突然间他意识到那是他的伊丽莎白，他自己却没认出，她穿上粉色的上衣看起来真可爱！伊丽莎白在和威利·蒂特科姆说话的时候，觉得父亲在看自己。于是她向他走去，父女俩站在一起。此时宴会接近尾声，他俩瞧着客人们散去，屋子里愈来愈空荡荡的，各种东西在地上散乱地摆着。甚至埃莉·亨德森也要离开了，她差不多是最后一个走的，虽然没有人和她说过话，可她想要亲见每一件事，回去讲给伊迪丝听。而令理查德与伊丽莎白相当开心的是宴会结束了，不过理查德为自己女儿感到骄傲。他本不打算告诉她的，但还是忍不住告诉了她。他说道，我看着你的时候，心里想那美丽的女孩是谁呢？原来是自己的女儿呀！她听后很开心。但她可怜的狗正在嚎叫。","For her father had been looking at her, as he stood talking to the Bradshaws, and he had thought to himself, Who is that lovely girl?And suddenly he realised that it was his Elizabeth, and he had not recognised her, she looked so lovely in her pink frock!Elizabeth had felt him looking at her as she talked to Willie Titcomb.So she went to him and they stood together, now that the party was almost over, looking at the people going, and the rooms getting emptier and emptier, with things scattered on the floor.Even Ellie Henderson was going, nearly last of all, though no one had spoken to her, but she had wanted to see everything, to tell Edith.And Richard and Elizabeth were rather glad it was over, but Richard was proud of his daughter.And he had not meant to tell her, but he could not help telling her.He had looked at her, he said, and he had wondered, Who is that lovely girl?and it was his daughter!That did make her happy.But her poor dog was howling."
"“理查德进步了。你讲得不错。”萨莉说道。“我要去跟他谈谈。我会向他告辞。脑子有什么要紧，”罗塞特太太说道，一边站了起来，“与心灵相比的话？”","“Richard has improved.You are right,” said Sally.“I shall go and talk to him.I shall say goodnight.What does the brain matter,” said Lady Rosseter, getting up, “compared with the heart?”"
"“我会来的。”彼得说道，可他继续坐了片刻。为什么会畏惧？为什么会狂喜？他暗自思量。是什么让我如此激动？","“I will come,” said Peter, but he sat on for a moment.What is this terror?what is this ecstasy? he thought to himself.What is it that fills me with extraordinary excitement?"
"是克拉丽莎，他说。","It is Clarissa, he said."
"因为她就在那里。","For there she was."
