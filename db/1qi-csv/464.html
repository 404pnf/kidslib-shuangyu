		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >谈到地狱之火时，我们不再痛苦呻吟，也不再出于悔恨而往头上堆灰。因为连传教士都开始告诉我们上帝是镭、或者以太，或者某种科学化合物，我们这些缺德鬼能得到的最糟糕的报应也不过是一次化学反应。这种假设让人满意，但正统观念形成的古老而巨大的恐惧仍徘徊在人们心中。</td>
		<td class="en">We no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of Tophet are mentioned.For, even the preachers have begun to tell us that God is radium, or ether or some scientific compound, and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction.This is a pleasing hypothesis; but there lingers yet some of the old, goodly terror of orthodoxy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >只有两个话题人们可以随意想象、自由谈论，而没有被反驳的可能。你可以谈论自己的梦，你也可以讲述从鹦鹉那里听来的话。睡神和鹦鹉都不是称职的证人，所以听众不敢抨击你的论述。因此，本故事的主题就由毫无根据的幻想虚构而来——而不是漂亮鹦鹉内容偏狭的闲谈，故在此表示遗憾和歉意。</td>
		<td class="en">There are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination, and without the possibility of being controverted.You may talk of your dreams; and you may tell what you heard a parrot say.Both Morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses; and your listener dare not attack your recital.The baseless fabric of a vision, then, shall furnish my theme—chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty Polly’s small talk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我做了一个梦，与高等考证毫不相关，但和古老的、可敬的、令人哀叹的审判论密切相关。</td>
		<td class="en">I had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient, respectable, and lamented bar-of-judgment theory.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >加布里埃尔打出了他的王牌，而我们当中不能照做的都被传讯受审。我注意到一群职业保人聚在一边，他们身着庄重的黑色，衣领从背后扣紧；但他们的房地产所有权似乎有问题，所以看起来他们无法将我们中任何一个人保出来。</td>
		<td class="en">Gabriel had played his trump; and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination.I noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind; but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles; and they did not appear to be getting any of us out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个飞警——天界警察——向我飞来，抓住了我左边的翅膀。近在身旁的一群灵魂正在候审，他们看起来非常阔绰。</td>
		<td class="en">A fly cop—an angel policeman—flew over to me and took me by the left wing.Near at hand was a group of very prosperous-looking spirits arraigned for judgment.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西在一家百货商店工作。她出售汉堡边饰、瓤柿子椒、汽车和其他百货商店常有的琐细杂物。在达尔西的收入中，每周的薪水有六美元。剩余的则以她为贷方，某人为借方记在那本由上帝掌管的分类账上——哦，尊敬的牧师，您称上帝为原始能量——好吧，记在原始能量的分类账上。</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie worked in a department store.She sold Hamburg edging, or stuffed peppers, or automobiles, or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores.Of what she earned, Dulcie received six dollars per week.The remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else’s account in the ledger kept by G—Oh, primal energy, you say, Reverend Doctor—Well then, in the Ledger of Primal Energy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西第一年在这家商店上班的时候，每周的薪水是五美元。弄清楚她靠那点钱怎样度日应该极具教育意味。不感兴趣？好吧，可能钱多点儿，你就感兴趣了。六美元就是个大点儿的数目。我会告诉你，她每周是如何靠六美元过活的。</td>
		<td class="en">During her first year in the store, Dulcie was paid five dollars per week.It would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount.Don’t care?Very well; probably you are interested in larger amounts.Six dollars is a larger amount.I will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天下午六点，达尔西把女帽饰针别在离延髓八分之一英寸的地方，对她的好姐妹萨迪——通常用身体左侧对着客人的那个女孩说：</td>
		<td class="en">One afternoon at six, when Dulcie was sticking her hat-pin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata, she said to her chum, Sadie—the girl that waits on you with her left side:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喂，萨迪，我今晚和猪娃约好去吃晚饭。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Say, Sade, I made a date for dinner this evening with Piggy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你可从来没去过！”萨迪羡慕地叫道。“哎呀，你可真够走运的。猪娃可时髦了，而且他总是带姑娘去时髦的地方。有天晚上，他带布兰奇去霍夫曼剧院，那里有流行音乐，还能见到很多名流。你今晚会很风光的，达尔西。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You never did!” exclaimed Sadie admiringly.“Well, ain’t you the lucky one?Piggy’s an awful swell; and he always takes a girl to swell places.He took Blanche up to the Hoffman House one evening, where they have swell music, and you see a lot of swells.You’ll have a swell time, Dulce.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西匆忙往家赶。她双眼发亮，脸颊泛着生活的——真正生活的——就要来临的黎明的淡粉色。那天是星期五，她上星期的工资还剩五十美分。</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie hurried homeward.Her eyes were shining, and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of life’s—real life’s—approaching dawn.It was Friday; and she had fifty cents left of her last week’s wages.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正值下班高峰期，街道上挤满了人。百老汇的电灯闪闪发光——方圆几英里、几里格、甚至几百里格的飞蛾都飞出暗处，来到这所烧焦了的学校。男人们衣冠楚楚、表情呆板，就好像海员之家的老水手刻在樱桃核上的面孔一样，达尔西快速地从他们身边经过，对他们毫不理会，他们则扭头盯着她看。曼哈顿，一朵夜间绽放的仙影拳，正舒展它苍白的、气味浓郁的花瓣。</td>
		<td class="en">The streets were filled with the rush-hour floods of people.The electric lights of Broadway were glowing—calling moths from miles, from leagues, from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school.Men in accurate clothes, with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors’ homes, turned and stared at Dulcie as she sped, unheeding, past them.Manhattan, the night-blooming cereus, was beginning to unfold its dead-white, heavy-odoured petals.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西来到一家卖便宜货的商店，用剩余的五十美分买了条仿制的蕾丝花边衣领。那些钱本来是另有用途的——晚饭十五美分，早饭十美分，午饭十美分。另外十美分她本该存入她微薄的储蓄，还有五美分可以用来挥霍在欧亚甘草上——那种可以使你的脸颊绷得像牙疼得肿了一样且持续时间也和牙疼一样长的糖。这甘草糖可是奢侈品——几乎相当于一次狂饮欢宴——可没有乐趣的生活还有什么意思呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents.That money was to have been spent otherwise—fifteen cents for supper, ten cents for breakfast, ten cents for lunch.Another dime was to be added to her small store of savings; and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops—the kind that made your cheek look like the toothache, and last as long.The licorice was an extravagance—almost a carouse—but what is life without pleasures?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西住在带家具出租的房间里。带家具出租的房间和供膳食的家庭旅馆之间有这样的区别。在带家具出租的房间里，别人不知道你正在挨饿。</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie lived in a furnished room.There is this difference between a furnished room and a boardinghouse.In a furnished room, other people do not know it when you go hungry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西上楼到了她的房间。她住在曼哈顿西区一栋正面用褐石建造的房屋内，她的房间在三层的阴面。她点亮了煤气灯。科学家告诉我们钻石是迄今所知的最硬的物质。他们错了。房东太太们就知道一种化合物，钻石和这种化合物相比软得像油灰。她们把这东西塞到煤气灯的顶端，任你站在椅子上挖，直到你的手指变红擦伤也是白费力气。发夹也挖不出来它，所以我们就权且称它为“挖不动”吧。</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie went up to her room—the third floor back in a West Side brownstone-front.She lit the gas.Scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known.Their mistake.Landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty.They pack it in the tips of gas-burners; and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one’s fingers are pink and bruised.A hairpin will not remove it; therefore let us call it immovable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，达尔西点燃了煤气灯。在这四分之一的烛光亮度下，我们来观察下这间屋子。</td>
		<td class="en">So Dulcie lit the gas.In its one-fourth-candlepower glow we will observe the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沙发床、梳妆台、桌子、脸盆架、椅子——房东太太一时疏忽，留了这么多的家具。其余的是达尔西的。梳妆台上的是她的宝贝——萨迪送她的镀金陶瓷花瓶，腌菜厂发行的日历，一本解梦的书，玻璃盘里的一些米粉和一串用粉色丝带扎起来的假樱桃。</td>
		<td class="en">Couch-bed, dresser, table, washstand, chair—of this much the landlady was guilty.The rest was Dulcie’s.On the dresser were her treasures—a gilt china vase presented to her by Sadie, a calendar issued by a pickle works, a book on the divination of dreams, some rice powder in a glass dish, and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >靠着那面有褶皱的镜子放着基奇纳将军、威廉·马尔登、马尔伯勒公爵夫人和本维努托·切利尼的画像。一面墙上挂着戴罗马头盔、名叫奥卡拉汉的熟石膏饰板。它的旁边是一幅鲜艳的仿油画石版画，画面上一个柠檬肤色的小孩在追捕一只活泼的蝴蝶。达尔西认为这幅画代表了艺术的最高境界，可还从未有人对此表示异议。人们关于其真伪的窃窃私语并没有扰乱她的平静；没有评论家因她的天真的昆虫家而眉头紧锁。</td>
		<td class="en">Against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of General Kitchener, William Muldoon, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini.Against one wall was a plaster of Paris plaque of an O’Callahan in a Roman helmet.Near it was a violent oleograph of a lemon-coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly.This was Dulcie’s final judgment in art; but it had never been upset.Her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes; no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >猪娃说好七点来接她。趁她迅速做准备的时候，我们还是悄悄转过身闲聊吧。</td>
		<td class="en">Piggy was to call for her at seven.While she swiftly makes ready, let us discreetly face the other way and gossip.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西每周花两美元租这间房。工作日里，她的早餐花费是十美分；她一边把咖啡和鸡蛋放在煤气灯上煮，一边穿衣服。星期天的早晨，她变得相当气派，花二十五美分在比利餐馆吃牛排和油炸菠萝馅饼——还给女服务员十美分的小费。纽约的诱惑如此之多，人们不自觉地想奢侈一把。午饭她在百货商店的餐厅吃，每周花掉六十美分；她晚餐每周要花一美元零五美分。晚报——哪里有不买报纸的纽约人啊——花去六美分；还有两份星期日报：一份只看私人广告栏，另一份用来悉心品读——花费十美分。总花费是四美元七十六美分。哦，人总要买新衣服的，还有——</td>
		<td class="en">For the room, Dulcie paid two dollars per week.On week-days her breakfast cost ten cents; she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing.On Sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at “Billy’s” restaurant, at a cost of twenty-five cents—and tipped the waitress ten cents.New York presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance.She had her lunches in the department-store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week; dinners were $1.05.The evening papers—show me a New Yorker going without his daily paper!—came to six cents; and two Sunday papers—one for the personal column and the other to read—were ten cents.The total amounts to $4.76.Now, one has to buy clothes, and—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >算啦算啦。我听说布料超级便宜，用针线就能缝织出奇迹来，不过我半信半疑。我想依据上帝所有不成文的、神圣的、自然的、闲置的关于平等的规条，给达尔西的生活添加些属于女性的乐趣，但我却徒劳地握着笔写不出一个字。她去过两次科尼岛，还骑过木马。一个人不能以小时而只能以年份来计算自己的乐趣，真是令人厌烦。</td>
		<td class="en">I give it up.I hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics, and of miracles performed with needle and thread; but I am in doubt.I hold my pen poised in vain when I would add to Dulcie’s life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten, sacred, natural, inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven.Twice she had been to Coney Island and had ridden the hobby-horses.’Tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >关于猪娃，一句话就足够了。姑娘们给他起这个外号，对高贵的猪族造成了本不应有的中伤。过去蓝皮拼写课本上刚开始讲的那些三个字母的单词，就是对猪娃的写照。他身材肥胖，有老鼠一样的灵魂，蝙蝠一样的习性，猫一样的肚量……他衣着华贵，还是个鉴定饥饿的行家。他看着一名女店员，就可以告诉你她上一次吃比果汁软糖和茶点稍有营养的东西是多长时间以前了，他可以这样讲上一个小时。他出没在商业区，徘徊在百货商店附近，随时准备邀人共进晚餐。用绳子牵着狗上街的男人们瞧不起他。他算是一个典型；我不能再写他了，我的笔可不是专门写他的；我又不是木匠。</td>
		<td class="en">Piggy needs but a word.When the girls named him, an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine.The words-of-three-letters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with Piggy’s biography.He was fat; he had the soul of a rat, the habits of a bat, and the magnanimity of a cat....He wore expensive clothes; and was a connoisseur in starvation.He could look at a shop-girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea.He hung about the shopping districts, and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner.Men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him.He is a type; I can dwell upon him no longer; my pen is not the kind intended for him; I am no carpenter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >差十分钟七点时，达尔西准备妥当了。她站在那面有波纹的镜子前，端详着自己。镜子里的自己令她满意。深蓝色连衣裙非常合身，一点褶皱都没有，插着一根漂亮黑羽毛的帽子，只是有一点点脏的手套——都表现出她是自我克制的人，甚至忍饥挨饿——都非常得体。</td>
		<td class="en">At ten minutes to seven Dulcie was ready.She looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror.The reflection was satisfactory.The dark blue dress, fitting without a wrinkle, the hat with its jaunty black feather, the but-slightly-soiled gloves—all representing self-denial, even of food itself—were vastly becoming.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西一时间忘记了其他的一切，只想到自己是美丽的，只想到生活即将揭开其神秘面纱的一角，让她欣赏生活的美妙。以前从没有哪位先生请她出去过。现在，她将奔赴光彩华丽、令人激动的景象，尽管只有短短的一刻。</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful, and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders.No gentleman had ever asked her out before.Now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >姑娘们说猪娃是“大手笔”。等着她的会有一场盛宴、音乐、穿着华丽的贵妇们，还有姑娘们一说起来下巴就会奇妙地扭动的美味佳肴。不可否认，她还会再次被邀请出来。有一扇橱窗她很熟悉，里面展示着一件蓝色茧绸套装——如果每周省下二十美分而不是十美分，得多长时间——让我们算算——唉，要好多年才能攒够！但是，第七大街上有一家二手商店，在那里——</td>
		<td class="en">The girls said that Piggy was a “spender.”There would be a grand dinner, and music, and splendidly dressed ladies to look at, and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls’ jaws when they tried to tell about them.No doubt she would be asked out again.There was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew—by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten, in—let’s see—Oh, it would run into years!But there was a second-hand store in Seventh Avenue where—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有人敲门。达尔西开了门。房东太太站在那里，边假笑边吸着鼻子，看是否有人偷煤气做饭。</td>
		<td class="en">Somebody knocked at the door.Dulcie opened it.The landlady stood there with a spurious smile, sniffing for cooking by stolen gas.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有位先生在楼下要找你。”她说，“他名叫威金斯。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A gentleman’s downstairs to see you,” she said.“Name is Mr. Wiggins.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那些不得不认真对待猪娃的可怜人都这样称呼他。</td>
		<td class="en">By such epithet was Piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西转身去梳妆台拿手帕；然后，她停了下来，使劲咬着下唇。在镜子里，她看到了仙境中的自己，一个公主，刚从长时间的沉睡中醒来。她忘记了有个人正用悲伤、美丽、严厉的眼神注视着她——唯有这个人才能赞赏或责备她的行为。基奇纳将军身材修长笔挺，英俊而忧郁的脸上满是哀伤的责备的神情，他正用他美妙的眼睛透过梳妆台上的镀金相框盯着她。</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief; and then she stopped still, and bit her underlip hard.While looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself, a princess, just awakening from a long slumber.She had forgotten one that was watching her with sad, beautiful, stern eyes—the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did.Straight and slender and tall, with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome, melancholy face, General Kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西像个自动玩具娃娃一样转向房东太太。</td>
		<td class="en">Dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“告诉他我不能去了，”她木然地说道，“说我病了什么的，说我不出去了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tell him I can’t go,” she said dully.“Tell him I’m sick, or something.Tell him I’m not going out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西把门关上并锁好后，就扑倒在她的床上，把帽上的黑羽毛都压坏了，然后哭了十分钟。基奇纳将军是她唯一的朋友。他是达尔西心中的英勇骑士的典范。他看起来似乎心有隐痛；他那奇妙的胡子梦幻般的美好；他眼中那严厉而又温柔的神色，让达尔西有点害怕。她曾经一度有个小小的幻想，就是在某个时候，基奇纳将军会到她的住处来找她，他腰间的长剑与脚上的长靴相碰，叮当作响。一次，一个男孩用一条锁链在路灯柱上弄得当啷当啷响，于是她打开窗户往外看了看。但是那些都没用。她知道基奇纳将军远在日本，率领他的军队与野蛮的土耳其人作战；他永远不会为了她走出镀金相框。然而，那天晚上，他的一个眼神就击败了猪娃。没错，那天晚上的确如此。</td>
		<td class="en">After the door was closed and locked, Dulcie fell upon her bed, crushing her black tip, and cried for ten minutes.General Kitchener was her only friend.He was Dulcie’s ideal of a gallant knight.He looked as if he might have a secret sorrow, and his wonderful moustache was a dream, and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes.She used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime, and ask for her, with his sword clanking against his high boots.Once, when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp-post she had opened the window and looked out.But there was no use.She knew that General Kitchener was away over in Japan, leading his army against the savage Turks; and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her.Yet one look from him had vanquished Piggy that night.Yes, for that night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哭完之后，达尔西就起来脱掉了她那件最好的衣服，穿上她那件宽大的蓝色旧和服。她不想吃晚饭。她唱了两段《萨米》。而后她又把注意力集中在了一侧鼻翼上的一个小红斑点上。处理完那个斑点后，她拉了一把椅子到那晃晃悠悠的桌子边，用一副旧扑克牌给自己算命。</td>
		<td class="en">When her cry was over Dulcie got up and took off her best dress, and put on her old blue kimono.She wanted no dinner.She sang two verses of “Sammy.”Then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose.And after that was attended to, she drew up a chair to the rickety table, and told her fortune with an old deck of cards.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个讨厌、无礼的家伙！”她大叫道。“我连一句话都没和他说过，也没有给过他一个眼神，就能让他那样想！”</td>
		<td class="en">“The horrid, impudent thing!” she said aloud.“And I never gave him a word or a look to make him think it!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >九点的时候，达尔西从箱子里拿出一盒饼干、一小罐树莓果酱，大吃了一顿。她用饼干蘸了点儿果酱给基奇纳将军；但他只是看着她，就像狮身人面像看着一只蝴蝶——如果沙漠里有蝴蝶的话。</td>
		<td class="en">At nine o’clock Dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk, and had a feast.She offered General Kitchener some jam on a cracker; but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly—if there are butterflies in the desert.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果你不想吃，就别吃，”达尔西说，“但也别那么神气，眼中满是责怪。我倒想知道，如果你每周不得不靠六块钱过活的话，你还会不会这么不可一世，这么傲慢自大！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t eat it if you don’t want to,” said Dulcie.“And don’t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes.I wonder if you’d be so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达尔西对基奇纳将军不礼貌，这可不是好兆头。接着，她又用力地把本维努托·切利尼的头像倒了过来。可这并非不可原谅；因为她总是认为他就是亨利八世，而她并不欣赏亨利八世。</td>
		<td class="en">It was not a good sign for Dulcie to be rude to General Kitchener.And then she turned Benvenuto Cellini face downward with a severe gesture.But that was not inexcusable; for she had always thought he was Henry VIII, and she did not approve of him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >九点半，达尔西往梳妆台上的画像看了最后一眼，关了灯，跳到床上。她上床时用眼神向基奇纳将军、威廉·马尔登、马尔伯勒公爵夫人和本维努托·切利尼道晚安，这真是一件糟糕的事情。这个故事确实没有什么结局。过了一段时间，发生了接下来的事——有一次，猪娃又请达尔西和他吃晚饭，而她觉得比平时更加孤独，而基奇纳将军凑巧没朝她看，然后——</td>
		<td class="en">At half-past nine Dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser, turned out the light, and skipped into bed.It’s an awful thing to go to bed with a good-night look at General Kitchener, William Muldoon, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini.This story really doesn’t get anywhere at all.The rest of it comes later—sometime when Piggy asks Dulcie again to dine with him, and she is feeling lonelier than usual, and General Kitchener happens to be looking the other way; and then—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如前所述，我梦见我站在一群看起来非常阔绰的天使旁边，一个警察抓住我的一只翅膀，问我和他们是不是一伙的。</td>
		<td class="en">As I said before, I dreamed that I was standing near a crowd of prosperous-looking angels, and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if I belonged with them.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“凭着您不朽的灵魂起誓，我和他们不是一伙的。”我说，“我只不过在孤儿院放了把火，还为一笔小钱杀了一个瞎子。”</td>
