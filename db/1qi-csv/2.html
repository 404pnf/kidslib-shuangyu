		<td class="en">Mr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort, arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他走下长廊，穿过连接勒布伦家一栋栋别墅的狭窄通道。他原本是坐在正屋门口的。鹦鹉和画眉都是勒布伦夫人的宝贝，它们有权为所欲为地喧闹。但当它们不惹人爱的时候，蓬迪里埃先生也有权走开。</td>
		<td class="en">He walked down the gallery and across the narrow “bridges” which connected the Lebrun cottages one with the other.He had been seated before the door of the main house.The parrot and the mockingbird were the property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the noise they wished.Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他走到自己的别墅门前停下来。他的别墅是从正屋数的第四栋，也是倒数第二栋。他在门口的柳条摇椅上坐下来，又接着读报。这天是星期天，报纸是前一天的。星期天的报纸还没送到格兰德岛上。他已经了解了有关市场的报道，便匆忙地瞅了几眼社论和杂七杂八的新闻，这些是他头一天离开新奥尔良前没来得及看的。</td>
		<td class="en">He stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one from the main building and next to the last.Seating himself in a wicker rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of reading the newspaper.The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old.The Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle.He was already acquainted with the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New Orleans the day before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃先生戴着一副眼镜。他四十来岁，中等身高，身形稍瘦，有点儿驼背。棕色的直发梳成分头。胡子被仔细地修剪得整整齐齐。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses.He was a man of forty, of medium height and rather slender build; he stooped a little.His hair was brown and straight, parted on one side.His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >偶尔他会把目光从报纸上移开，看看四周。宅子的噪音比以前更大了。正屋被称作“宅子”，以区别于其他的别墅。鸟儿们还在那儿喋喋不休地叫着。法理瓦尔家的双胞胎小姐妹正在钢琴上弹奏《扎姆巴》（注：《扎姆巴》：三幕喜歌剧）里的二重奏。勒布伦夫人正忙里忙外，一进屋就要对院子里的杂工大声地发号施令；一出门又要用同样的嗓门对饭厅里的侍女指东道西的。她是一个皮肤鲜亮的漂亮女子，总穿着白色短袖衣服。来回进出时她那浆得硬挺的裙子发出沙沙的声响。远处一栋别墅前，一位身穿黑衣服的女子正娴静地来回走动，边走边数着念珠。膳宿公寓里的很多人都乘坐博德莱家的帆船到谢尼·卡米内达去望弥撒了。‎‏一些年轻人在水栎树下玩槌球。蓬迪里埃先生那两个长得结结实实的孩子也在那儿，两个小家伙一个四岁，一个五岁。一个有点黑人血统的保姆跟着他们，心不在焉的样子，好像在想着什么。蓬迪里埃先生终于点了支雪茄烟开始抽起来，任凭报纸从手中散乱地滑落到地上。他的目光停在一把白色的太阳伞上，它正从海滩缓缓地向前移动。透过细长的水栎树干的缝隙，穿过一片黄春菊丛，他可以清楚地看到它。远处，朦朦胧胧中，海湾与蓝色的地平线交融在一起。太阳伞还在徐徐地靠近。粉色边的伞盖下走着他的妻子蓬迪里埃夫人和年轻的罗伯特·勒布伦。他们俩走到别墅跟前时，面对面地坐到了走廊的上层台阶上，每人靠着一根柱子，面露倦色。</td>
		<td class="en">Once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him.There was more noise than ever over at the house.The main building was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages.The chattering and whistling birds were still at it.Two young girls, the Farival twins, were playing a duet from “Zampa” upon the piano.Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside.She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves.Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went.Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads.A good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet’s lugger to hear mass.Some young people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet.Mr. Pontellier’s two children were there sturdy little fellows of four and five.A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper drag idly from his hand.He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail’s pace from the beach.He could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile.The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the horizon.The sunshade continued to approach slowly.Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun.When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each other, each leaning against a supporting post.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真蠢！在这么热的天气里的这个时候去洗澡。”蓬迪里埃先生大声说。他自己在天刚亮时已经下水洗了一阵子。因此这个上午对他来说特别漫长。</td>
		<td class="en">“What folly!To bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr. Pontellier.He himself had taken a plunge at daylight.That was why the morning seemed long to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你被晒得都让人认不出来了。”他看着他的妻子接着说道，就好像看着一件受了些损坏的贵重私人物件一样。她伸出两只又结实又漂亮的手，又把浅黄色的袖子拉到手腕上边，挑剔地打量着自己的手。看着她的手，她忽然想起了她的戒指，临去海滩前她把它们交给了她的丈夫。她默默地向他伸出手，他明白了她的意思，从背心兜儿里掏出戒指放入她打开的掌心。她把戒指一个个套上，然后抱着双膝看着罗伯特笑起来。戒指在她手指上闪闪发光。罗伯特也冲她回以微笑。</td>
		<td class="en">“You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage.She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them critically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists.Looking at them reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach.She silently reached out to him, and he, understanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm.She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh.The rings sparkled upon her fingers.He sent back an answering smile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么事？”蓬迪里埃先生边问边懒散地向两人各看了一眼，感到很好笑。其实完全只是胡闹，是他们在水里遇到的有意思的事，他们俩都争着马上讲出来。可是讲出来以后就没那么有意思了。他们意识到了这一点，蓬迪里埃先生也是这么觉得。他打了个哈欠，又伸伸懒腰。然后他站起来，说他有点想去克莱恩旅馆玩一盘台球。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to the other.It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the water, and they both tried to relate it at once.It did not seem half so amusing when told.They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier.He yawned and stretched himself.Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein’s hotel and play a game of billiards.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“走吧，一块儿去玩吧，勒布伦！”他向罗伯特建议道。但罗伯特十分坦率地说他更愿意留下来陪蓬迪里埃夫人聊天。</td>
		<td class="en">“Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert.But Robert admitted quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs. Pontellier.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，爱德娜，他要是招你烦了，你就让他干自己的事去吧。”她丈夫准备走时叮嘱她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,” instructed her husband as he prepared to leave.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，把伞带上。”她边喊边把伞递给他。他接过伞，撑在头顶，下了台阶走了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him.He accepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps and walked away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你回来吃午饭吗？”她的妻子在他身后喊道。他停了一下，耸了耸肩。他伸手摸了摸背心口袋，里面有一张十美元的钞票。他自己也说不好，或许回来吃顿午饭，或许不回。这都要看他在克莱恩旅馆找到什么球友和台球戏的规模而定。他没明说，但她懂他的意思，笑了笑，点了点头表示再见。</td>
		<td class="en">“Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him.He halted a moment and shrugged his shoulders.He felt in his vest pocket; there was a ten-dollar bill there.He did not know; perhaps he would return for the early dinner and perhaps he would not.It all depended upon the company which he found over at Klein’s and the size of “the game.”He did not say this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个孩子看到爸爸要出门都要跟着去。他亲了亲他们，答应他们回来时会给他们带糖果和花生。</td>
		<td class="en">Both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out.He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二章</td>
		<td class="en">II</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃夫人的眼睛灵动而闪亮，棕黄的颜色接近于她的发色。她看东西时常常眼睛很快地转到这个东西上，然后又盯住它不动，好像陷入了内心的千思万绪之中。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Pontellier’s eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish brown, about the color of her hair.She had a way of turning them swiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of contemplation or thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她眉毛的颜色比发色深些。这又浓又直的眉毛使她的眼睛显得格外深邃。与其说她长得美丽，还不如说她长得俊俏。她有一张迷人的面庞，这是由于她表情坦率，神情难以捉摸而又微妙地变化着。她的确有着动人的风韵。</td>
		<td class="en">Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair.They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes.She was rather handsome than beautiful.Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features.Her manner was engaging.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗伯特卷了一支烟。他抽自己卷的纸烟，他说这是因为他抽不起雪茄。他兜里有一支雪茄，是蓬迪里埃先生送给他的，他准备留着饭后抽。</td>
		<td class="en">Robert rolled a cigarette.He smoked cigarettes because he could not afford cigars, he said.He had a cigar in his pocket which Mr. Pontellier had presented him with, and he was saving it for his after-dinner smoke.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这对于他似乎是很正当且自然的事。在肤色上，他和他的同伴颇为相像。他的脸修得干干净净，使这种相像更加鲜明。从他那明朗的面容看他没有任何忧愁。他的眼睛聚集和反射着夏日的光辉与沉闷。</td>
		<td class="en">This seemed quite proper and natural on his part.In coloring he was not unlike his companion.A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more pronounced than it would otherwise have been.There rested no shadow of care upon his open countenance.His eyes gathered in and reflected the light and languor of the summer day.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃夫人伸手拿起放在门廊上的棕榈叶扇子扇了起来。罗伯特则抽着烟，口吐阵阵轻烟。他们一直在聊天：谈到他们周围的琐事；谈到他们在水里的趣事——这件事现在好像又变得有意思起来；谈到风和树，还有那些去谢尼的人；谈到水栎树下玩槌球的孩子们，以及正在弹奏《诗人和农夫》序曲的法里瓦尔家的双胞胎。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from his cigarette.They chatted incessantly: about the things around them; their amusing adventure out in the water—it had again assumed its entertaining aspect; about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone to the Cheniere; about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and the Farival twins, who were now performing the overture to “The Poet and the Peasant.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗伯特讲了很多他自己的事。他还相当年轻，懂得并不多。蓬迪里埃夫人出于同样的原因也只是讲了一点儿关于自己的事。他们彼此对对方说的都颇感兴趣。罗伯特讲到秋天他打算去墨西哥，在那儿他有发财的机会。他一直都想去墨西哥，但因为种种原因一直没去成。他现在在新奥尔良的一家商号拥有一个小职位，由于对英语、法语和西班牙语都同样精通，所以在那儿无论作为书记员还是联络员他都很受重视。</td>
		<td class="en">Robert talked a good deal about himself.He was very young, and did not know any better.Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason.Each was interested in what the other said.Robert spoke of his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him.He was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got there.Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in New Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French and Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >目前他像往常一样正在格兰德岛他母亲这里度暑假。以前，尚在罗伯特记事前，这座“宅子”曾是专门供勒布伦家来消夏的地方。现在它的两侧盖起了十几栋别墅，总是住满了只从法国居住区来的游客，因此勒布伦夫人仍然可以维持她安逸舒服的生活，过这种生活似乎是她与生俱来的权利。</td>
		<td class="en">He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother at Grand Isle.In former times, before Robert could remember, “the house” had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns.Now, flanked by its dozen or more cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the “Quartier Francais,” it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃夫人讲起了她父亲在密西西比河上的庄园和她少女时期在熟悉的肯塔基州早熟禾草原地区的家。她是个美国女人，融入了一点法国血统，后来好像也被冲淡并消失了。她读了她妹妹从东方给她寄来的信。她的妹妹已经订婚了，并打算结婚。罗伯特很感兴趣，想知道她的姐妹们是什么样的女孩子，她的父亲又是什么样子，她的母亲去世多长时间了。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father’s Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old Kentucky bluegrass country.She was an American woman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in dilution.She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and who had engaged herself to be married.Robert was interested, and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃夫人把信收起来的时候，已经是该换衣服吃午饭的时间了。</td>
		<td class="en">When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the early dinner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我看莱翁斯不会回来了。”她边说边朝她丈夫离开的方向看了一眼。罗伯特也觉得他不会回来了，因为有很多新奥尔良俱乐部的男人都在克莱恩旅馆那儿。</td>
		<td class="en">“I see Leonce isn’t coming back,” she said, with a glance in the direction whence her husband had disappeared.Robert supposed he was not, as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein’s.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当蓬迪里埃夫人离开他进屋时，这个年轻人就下了台阶，踱步走到玩槌球的孩子们那儿。就在那儿，趁着午饭前的半个小时，他和蓬迪里埃家的小孩们玩了一会儿，孩子们都很喜欢他。</td>
		<td class="en">When Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room, the young man descended the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players, where, during the half-hour before dinner, he amused himself with the little Pontellier children, who were very fond of him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第三章 </td>
		<td class="en">III</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天晚上十一点蓬迪里埃先生才从克莱恩旅馆回到家。他兴致很高，情绪不错，非常健谈。他一进家门就把已经在床上熟睡的妻子吵醒了。他一边脱衣服一边和她说话，告诉她这一天所听来的奇闻趣事、琐碎消息和闲话。他从裤兜儿里掏出一把皱巴巴的钞票，还有很多银币，它们和钥匙、小刀、手绢还有其他任何也装在裤兜里的东西一起被杂乱地堆放在梳妆台上。她太困了，只能支支吾吾地应答着。</td>
		<td class="en">It was eleven o’clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from Klein’s hotel.He was in an excellent humor, in high spirits, and very talkative.His entrance awoke his wife, who was in bed and fast asleep when he came in.He talked to her while he undressed, telling her anecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the day.From his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver coin, which he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys, knife, handkerchief, and whatever else happened to be in his pockets.She was overcome with sleep, and answered him with little half utterances.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他感觉非常败兴。他的妻子是他生存的唯一目标，可她对他所在意的事情却毫无兴致，对他的谈话丝毫也不重视。</td>
		<td class="en">He thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object of his existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned him, and valued so little his conversation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃先生早把孩子们的糖果和花生的事忘到了脑后。但是他是非常疼爱孩子们的，他走进隔壁孩子们的卧室去看了一看，确保孩子们睡得舒适。这一看结果却不令他满意。他把孩子们在床上翻了翻身又挪动了几下。其中一个开始边踢腿边说梦话，说满满一篮子螃蟹之类的胡话。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys.Notwithstanding he loved them very much, and went into the adjoining room where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they were resting comfortably.The result of his investigation was far from satisfactory.He turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed.One of them began to kick and talk about a basket full of crabs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃先生回到妻子身边，对她说拉乌尔发高烧，需要照顾。然后他点了支雪茄，走到敞开的门旁边坐下抽烟。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Pontellier returned to his wife with the information that Raoul had a high fever and needed looking after.Then he lit a cigar and went and sat near the open door to smoke it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃夫人非常肯定拉乌尔没发烧。她说他上床时很好，这一天也没感觉哪里不适。可蓬迪里埃先生对发烧的症状非常了解，不会搞错。他向她确保孩子此刻正在隔壁房间饱受高烧之苦。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Pontellier was quite sure Raoul had no fever.He had gone to bed perfectly well, she said, and nothing had ailed him all day.Mr. Pontellier was too well acquainted with fever symptoms to be mistaken.He assured her the child was consuming at that moment in the next room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他责备妻子不关心孩子们，一向忽视他们。照顾孩子如果不是做母亲的本分的话，又究竟该是谁的呢？他自己手头满是经纪行的业务。他不能同时承担这两个重任：又要在外面赚钱养家糊口，又要在家里照看孩子，确保他们安然无恙。他絮絮叨叨地不停地数落着。</td>
		<td class="en">He reproached his wife with her inattention, her habitual neglect of the children.If it was not a mother’s place to look after children, whose on earth was it?He himself had his hands full with his brokerage business.He could not be in two places at once; making a living for his family on the street, and staying at home to see that no harm befell them.He talked in a monotonous, insistent way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃夫人从床上跳起来，去了隔壁房间。不一会儿她就回来了，坐在床边，把头倚在枕头上。她什么也不说，也不回答她丈夫的问话。他抽完烟就上了床，半分钟不到就睡熟了。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Pontellier sprang out of bed and went into the next room.She soon came back and sat on the edge of the bed, leaning her head down on the pillow.She said nothing, and refused to answer her husband when he questioned her.When his cigar was smoked out he went to bed, and in half a minute he was fast asleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可此时，蓬迪里埃夫人却完全清醒了。她开始轻声哭泣起来，在睡衣袖子上擦着眼泪。吹灭她丈夫点着的还在燃着的蜡烛，她光脚穿上放在床脚的缎面拖鞋，往外走到门廊上。在那里她坐进柳条摇椅，开始轻轻地来回摇晃起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake.She began to cry a little, and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her peignoir.Blowing out the candle, which her husband had left burning, she slipped her bare feet into a pair of satin mules at the foot of the bed and went out on the porch, where she sat down in the wicker chair and began to rock gently to and fro.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >已经是后半夜了。所有别墅都漆黑一片。只有一道微弱的光线从主屋的廊道那里照射过来。外面寂静一片，只能听见水栎树顶一只老猫头鹰的叫声，还有在这夜深人静时分平和的海面上发出的永不停息的声音。它像凄婉的摇篮曲一样打破黑夜的宁静。</td>
		<td class="en">It was then past midnight.The cottages were all dark.A single faint light gleamed out from the hallway of the house.There was no sound abroad except the hooting of an old owl in the top of a water-oak, and the everlasting voice of the sea, that was not uplifted at that soft hour.It broke like a mournful lullaby upon the night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >蓬迪里埃夫人泪如雨下，睡衣袖子已经湿透，不能再用来擦泪了。她一只手抓住椅背，宽松的衣袖几乎从举起的手臂滑落到肩部。她转过身去，把热而潮湿的脸塞进臂弯里接着大哭，再也无心去擦拭她的面颊、眼睛和手臂了。她自己也说不清为什么哭。自从结婚以来像刚才这样的经历并不少见。不过之前她丈夫对她无微不至的体贴和一贯的忠诚似乎使这些经历显得微不足道，对于这些她是默然领会、心知肚明的。</td>
		<td class="en">The tears came so fast to Mrs. Pontellier’s eyes that the damp sleeve of her peignoir no longer served to dry them.She was holding the back of her chair with one hand; her loose sleeve had slipped almost to the shoulder of her uplifted arm.Turning, she thrust her face, steaming and wet, into the bend of her arm, and she went on crying there, not caring any longer to dry her face, her eyes, her arms.She could not have told why she was crying.Such experiences as the foregoing were not uncommon in her married life.They seemed never before to have weighed much against the abundance of her husband’s kindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be tacit and self-understood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一种来自于她意识陌生深处的无以名状的压抑感使她整个人充满了莫名的烦闷。这就像阴影，像迷雾，拂过她夏日的心灵。这是一种奇怪而陌生的感觉，是一种心情。她不是坐在那里暗自谴责她的丈夫，也不是在悲叹自己的命运，而正是命运引领她走上这条他们所走过的道路。她只是独自在那里痛哭。蚊子肆意地叮咬着她，叮咬着她结实圆润的手臂，叮咬着她赤裸的脚背。</td>
		<td class="en">An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish.It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul’s summer day.It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood.She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken.She was just having a good cry all to herself.The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The following morning Mr. Pontellier was up in good time to take the rockaway which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf.He was returning to the city to his business, and they would not see him again at the Island till the coming Saturday.He had regained his composure, which seemed to have been somewhat impaired the night before.He was eager to be gone, as he looked forward to a lively week in Carondelet Street.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Victor, with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling, was patching a corner of one of the galleries.Mariequita sat near by, dangling her legs, watching him work, and handing him nails from the tool-box.The sun was beating down upon them.The girl had covered her head with her apron folded into a square pad.They had been talking for an hour or more.She was never tired of hearing Victor describe the dinner at Mrs. Pontellier’s.He exaggerated every detail, making it appear a veritable Lucullean feast.The flowers were in tubs, he said.The champagne was quaffed from huge golden goblets.Venus rising from the foam could have presented no more entrancing a spectacle than Mrs. Pontellier, blazing with beauty and diamonds at the head of the board, while the other women were all of them youthful houris, possessed of incomparable charms.She got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs. Pontellier, and he gave her evasive answers, framed so as to confirm her belief.She grew sullen and cried a little, threatening to go off and leave him to his fine ladies.There were a dozen men crazy about her at the Cheniere; and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people, why, she could run away any time she liked to New Orleans with Celina’s husband.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >塞丽娜的丈夫是个傻瓜、胆小鬼、猪脑袋，为了证明给她看，维克托准备下次看见他要用锤子把他的脑袋砸成果酱。这个保证让玛丽吉塔非常安心。她擦干眼泪，马上高兴了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Celina’s husband was a fool, a coward, and a pig, and to prove it to her, Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he encountered him.This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita.She dried her eyes, and grew cheerful at the prospect.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们还在继续说着那天的晚宴和都市生活的魅力，这时候蓬迪里埃夫人从房子拐角处悄然走过来。在这个他们认为是幽灵的人影面前，这两个年轻人惊呆了。可这确实是活生生的蓬迪里埃夫人，看上去劳累不堪，有点旅途的疲惫。</td>
		<td class="en">They were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life when Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house.The two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to be an apparition.But it was really she in flesh and blood, looking tired and a little travel-stained.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是从码头那儿走过来的。”她说，“听到了锤子声。我想可能是你在修长廊。是件好事。去年夏天我总是被这些松了的木板绊倒。现在这里一切看上去是那么的沉闷荒凉！</td>
		<td class="en">“I walked up from the wharf”, she said, “and heard the hammering.I supposed it was you, mending the porch.It’s a good thing.I was always tripping over those loose planks last summer.How dreary and deserted everything looks!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >维克托好一会儿才搞明白她是坐博德莱的船来的，是独自来的，没有特别的目的，只是来休息休息。</td>
		<td class="en">It took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in Beaudelet’s lugger, that she had come alone, and for no purpose but to rest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您看，什么也没准备。我把我的房间给您，这是仅有的住处。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s nothing fixed up yet, you see.I’ll give you my room; it’s the only place.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有个地方就行。”她宽慰他道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Any corner will do,” she assured him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果您能将就菲罗梅做的饭，”他继续说，“不过既然您来了，我争取找她妈妈来。你认为她会来吗？”他转过去跟玛丽吉塔说。</td>
		<td class="en">“And if you can stand Philomel’s cooking,” he went on, “though I might try to get her mother while you are here.Do you think she would come?” turning to Mariequita.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛丽吉塔认为如果给她足够多的工钱或许菲罗梅的妈妈会来几天。</td>
		<td class="en">Mariequita thought that perhaps Philomel’s mother might come for a few days, and money enough.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看到蓬迪里埃夫人出现，这个女孩立刻怀疑这是情人的约会。可是维克托的吃惊是那么真实，蓬迪里埃夫人的冷漠又是那么明显，因此这种恼人的想法没有在她脑子里停留很久。她带着极大的兴致打量着这位举办了全美国最奢华的宴会，并使新奥尔良的所有男人都拜倒在她脚下的女人。</td>
		<td class="en">Beholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance, the girl had at once suspected a lovers’ rendezvous.But Victor’s astonishment was so genuine, and Mrs. Pontellier’s indifference so apparent, that the disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain.She contemplated with the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in America, and who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们几时吃饭？”爱德娜问，“我非常饿，不过不要额外加菜。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What time will you have dinner?” asked Edna.“I’m very hungry; but don’t get anything extra.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我立刻就叫人准备好。”他边说边匆忙把工具收好。“您可以先到我的房间梳洗并休息一下。让玛丽吉塔领您去。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll have it ready in little or no time,” he said, bustling and packing away his tools.“You may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself.Mariequita will show you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很感谢。”爱德娜说，“可你知道吗，我还想午饭前去海滩好好洗一洗，甚至还会游上一小会儿呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Thank you, ”said Edna.“But, do you know, I have a notion to go down to the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim, before dinner?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“水太凉了！”他们俩一起叫道，“别想这事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The water is too cold!” they both exclaimed.“Don’t think of it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那好吧，我可以下去试一试－－用脚趟趟水吧。我看阳光够强的，已经能把海洋深处的水都晒暖了。你能给我拿几块毛巾吗？我最好马上走，以便能及时赶回来。如果等到下午水可能会有点太凉了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I might go down and try—dip my toes in.Why, it seems to me the sun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean.Could you get me a couple of towels?I’d better go right away, so as to be back in time.It would be a little too chilly if I waited till this afternoon.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛丽吉塔跑到维克托的房间，回来时拿了些毛巾给爱德娜。</td>
		<td class="en">Mariequita ran over to Victor’s room, and returned with some towels, which she gave to Edna.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我希望午饭能有鱼吃，”爱德娜临走前说，“但如果没有的话也别另外去做。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I hope you have fish for dinner,” said Edna, as she started to walk away; “but don’t do anything extra if you haven’t.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“快跑去找菲罗梅的妈妈，”维克托指示那个女孩说，“我去厨房看看能做点什么。真是的！女人考虑事情可真不周全！她本可以给我提前捎个信的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Run and find Philomel’s mother,” Victor instructed the girl.“I’ll go to the kitchen and see what I can do.By Gimminy!Women have no consideration!She might have sent me word.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >爱德娜非常机械地往海滩走着，除了感觉烈日炎炎外没注意到任何特别的东西。她也没在专注地想某件特别的事。罗伯特走后，她独自躺在沙发上彻夜未眠时已经把该想的事都想了。</td>
		<td class="en">Edna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing anything special except that the sun was hot.She was not dwelling upon any particular train of thought.She had done all the thinking which was necessary after Robert went away, when she lay awake upon the sofa till morning.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她反复地跟自己说：“今天是阿罗宾，明天可能是别的人。这对我来说没什么区别，莱翁斯·蓬迪里埃也不重要－－但拉乌尔和艾蒂安！她现在清楚地理解很久以前她对阿黛尔·拉蒂诺尔所说的话的意义所在，她说她可以放弃那些不重要的东西，但她不会为了孩子而牺牲自己。</td>
		<td class="en">She had said over and over to herself: “To-day it is Arobin; to-morrow it will be some one else.It makes no difference to me, it doesn’t matter about Leonce Pontellier—but Raoul and Etienne!”She understood now clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to Adele Ratignolle that she would give up the unessential, but she would never sacrifice herself for her children.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在她醒着的那天晚上，沮丧情绪侵扰着她，到现在也挥之不去。这世间没有她留恋的东西了。除了罗伯特之外，她也不想任何人在她身边。她甚至意识到将来会有那么一天，就连他也会从她脑海里消失，她再也不会想起他，于是只剩下她孤单的自己。孩子们像征服了她的敌人一样出现在她面前，他们控制了她，压倒了她，还试图在她生命中余下的日子里把她拖入灵魂的奴役之中。可她知道有一种方法可以逃避他们。当她往海边走的时候，她不想这些事情了。</td>
		<td class="en">Despondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night, and had never lifted.There was no one thing in the world that she desired.There was no human being whom she wanted near her except Robert; and she even realized that the day would come when he, too, and the thought of him would melt out of her existence, leaving her alone.The children appeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her; who had overpowered and sought to drag her into the soul’s slavery for the rest of her days.But she knew a way to elude them.She was not thinking of these things when she walked down to the beach.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >海湾的水面在她面前伸展开来，在阳光照耀下波光粼粼。大海的声音充满了诱惑，无休无止，时而低吟，时而高亢，凄凄婉婉，呼唤着灵魂在孤独的深渊中徘徊。绵延的白色海滩上，由远至近，望过去空无一人。一只翅膀受伤的小鸟正在振翅起飞，可是它盘旋着，拍打着翅膀，翻滚着落了下去，最后跌入水中。</td>
		<td class="en">The water of the Gulf stretched out before her, gleaming with the million lights of the sun.The voice of the sea is seductive, never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander in abysses of solitude.All along the white beach, up and down, there was no living thing in sight.A bird with a broken wing was beating the air above, reeling, fluttering, circling disabled down, down to the water.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >爱德娜发现她的旧泳衣还挂在原来的木桩上，已经褪了色。</td>
		<td class="en">Edna had found her old bathing suit still hanging, faded, upon its accustomed peg.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她把它穿上，把她身穿的衣服留在更衣室里。当她在海边完全一个人时，她把紧箍在她身上的不舒服的泳衣脱下。这是她平生第一次在户外赤裸着身体，沐浴在阳光下，任凭海风吹拂着她，海浪召唤着她。</td>
		<td class="en">She put it on, leaving her clothing in the bath-house.But when she was there beside the sea, absolutely alone, she cast the unpleasant, pricking garments from her, and for the first time in her life she stood naked in the open air, at the mercy of the sun, the breeze that beat upon her, and the waves that invited her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >赤裸地站在蓝天下感觉是那么奇怪，那么恐怖！但又那么美妙！她感觉像是一个新生的生命，在从未了解的却又熟悉的世界里睁开了眼睛。</td>
		<td class="en">How strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky!how delicious!She felt like some new-born creature, opening its eyes in a familiar world that it had never known.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >溅着泡沫的波浪淹没了她雪白的脚，又像蛇一样盘在她的双膝。她趟水往前走。海水冰凉，但她还是继续往前走。海水很深，但她抬起身体，展开双臂慢慢地用力划水向前。大海的爱抚舒服极了，海水拥着她的身体，温柔而又亲密。</td>
		<td class="en">The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like serpents about her ankles.She walked out.The water was chill, but she walked on.The water was deep, but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long, sweeping stroke.The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她继续向前游着。她回忆起那天晚上她游得很远，并记起当时害怕再也回不到岸上的那种恐惧感。她现在也不回头看，只是往前游，又想起儿时穿过草原的情景，相信那没有起点也没有终点。</td>
		<td class="en">She went on and on.She remembered the night she swam far out, and recalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain the shore.She did not look back now, but went on and on, thinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little child, believing that it had no beginning and no end.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她胳膊和腿都非常累。</td>
		<td class="en">Her arms and legs were growing tired.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她想到了莱翁斯和孩子们。他们是她生活的一部分。可他们不应该认为他们能够占有她－－她的身体和灵魂。如果雷西小姐知道的话一定会笑话她，也许还会嗤之以鼻的。“你还称自己为艺术家呢！真是自负啊，女士！艺术家必须拥有敢于挑战与蔑视的勇气。”</td>
		<td class="en">She thought of Leonce and the children.They were a part of her life.But they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and soul.How Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed, perhaps sneered, if she knew!“And you call yourself an artist!What pretensions, Madame!The artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >疲倦慢慢压上了她并最终征服了她。</td>
		<td class="en">Exhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再见吧！正因为我爱你。”他根本不知道，他根本不懂。他永远不会懂的。或许如果她去见芒代勒医生，他会理解她的－－但一切都太迟了，海岸已经远远抛在后面，她已经精疲力竭了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Good-by—because I love you.”He did not know; he did not understand.He would never understand.Perhaps Doctor Mandelet would have understood if she had seen him—but it was too late; the shore was far behind her, and her strength was gone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她往远处看去，曾经的那种恐惧又一次攫住了她，接着又消失了。爱德娜仿佛又听到她父亲的声音，还有她姐姐玛格丽特。她听到了拴在枫树上的一只老狗的叫声。还听到骑兵军官走过长廊时靴刺发出的铿锵声。还有蜜蜂的嗡嗡叫声和空气中弥漫着的石竹花的清香。</td>
		<td class="en">She looked into the distance, and the old terror flamed up for an instant, then sank again.Edna heard her father’s voice and her sister Margaret’s.She heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the sycamore tree.The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked across the porch.There was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks filled the air.</td></tr>
