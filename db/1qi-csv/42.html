I have no difficulty in living on twenty-four hours a day. I do all that I want to do, and still find time to go in for newspaper competitions.

Will you kindly send me your name and address, and state your charge for telling me how you do it? Instead of me talking to you, you ought to be talking to me. Please come forward. That you exist, I am convinced, and that I have not yet encountered you is my loss. Meanwhile, until you appear, I will continue to chat with my companions in distress—that innumerable band of souls who are haunted, more or less painfully, by the feeling that the years slip by, and slip by, and slip by, and that they have not yet been able to get their lives into proper working order.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >倘若揣摩这种情绪，我们会发现这主要是一种不安、期待、希求或渴望。这种情绪长久地令人不能舒畅，在我们一切享乐的盛宴上，它像骷髅一般时隐时现。我们看戏眉开眼笑，可剧幕间骷髅会伸出它皮包骨的手指朝我们指指点点。为了赶上最后一趟列车，我们向车站狂奔，站在月台上等这班列车到达、顺便喘息的那好一阵子，它又会拖着满身的骨头在我们身边晃荡并询问道：“哦，你的年轻时代是怎样度过的？你现在这个年龄又在做些什么？”也许你会强调说，这种不断向前看的感觉抑或抱负是生活本身的一部分，跟生活密不可分。你说的没错！</td>
		<td class="en">If we analyse that feeling, we shall perceive it to be, primarily, one of uneasiness, of expectation, of looking forward, of aspiration. It is a source of constant discomfort, for it behaves like a skeleton at the feast of all our enjoyments. We go to the theatre and laugh; but between the acts it raises a skinny finger at us. We rush violently for the last train, and while we are cooling a long age on the platform waiting for the last train, it promenades its bones up and down by our side and inquires:“O man, what hast thou done with thy youth? What art thou doing with thine age?” You may urge that this feeling of continuous looking forward, of aspiration, is part of life itself, and inseparable from life itself. True!  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但有程度之别。某人也许渴望去麦加，他的良心告诉自己应该去。他动身前往，或许有库克旅行社的帮助，或许毫无援助；很可能他永远到不了麦加，也许还没到塞德港就已溺水身亡；也许他在红海岸边不甚体面地溘然长逝；也许他的意愿永远无法实现。尚未实现的抱负可能一直困扰他。但他承受的折磨跟其他人所受的折磨又不一样，后者意欲抵达麦加，甚至为那种欲望所折磨，可却不曾离开过布里克斯顿。</td>
		<td class="en">But there are degrees. A man may desire to go to Mecca. His conscience tells him that he ought to go to Mecca. He fares forth, either by the aid of Cook’s, or unassisted; he may probably never reach Mecca; he may drown before he gets to Port Said; he may perish ingloriously on the coast of the Red Sea; his desire may remain eternally frustrate. Unfulfilled aspiration may always trouble him. But he will not be tormented in the same way as the man who, desiring to reach Mecca, and harried by the desire to reach Mecca, never leaves Brixton1.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走出布里克斯顿，已经很了不起；我们大多数人都不曾离开布里克斯顿。我们甚至不曾搭计程车去拉德盖特广场咨询库克旅行社参加有向导的旅游得花费多少。我们给自己的借口是一天只有24小时。</td>
		<td class="en">It is something to have left Brixton. Most of us have not left Brixton. We have not even taken a cab to Ludgate Circus and inquired from Cook’s the price of a conducted tour. And our excuse to ourselves is that there are only twenty-four hours in the day.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >倘若我们进一步分析这种模糊而又令人焦躁的渴望，我想我们将会发现这种感觉源于一种固有观念：除了出于忠诚和道义必须完成的工作以外，我们还应该另有所为。按成文和不成文的规定，我们必须维持自己以及家人（如果有的话）的健康和舒适、偿还贷款、储蓄、提高效率以求增加财富。这相当不易！能做到的人寥寥无几！往往超出我们能力所及！然而，即便有时我们做到了，也并不感到满意，因为那骷髅还是纠缠着我们。</td>
		<td class="en">If we further analyse our vague, uneasy aspiration, we shall,I think,see that it springs from a fixed idea that we ought to do something in addition to those things which we are loyally and morally obliged to do. We are obliged, by various codes written and unwritten, to maintain ourselves and our families (if any) in health and comfort, to pay our debts, to save, to increase our prosperity by increasing our efficiency. A task sufficiently difficult! A task which very few of us achieve! A task often beyond our skill! Yet, if we succeed in it, as we sometimes do, we are not satisfied; the skeleton is still with us.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >即便我们意识到任务非我们能力所及，不可能凭自己的能力应对；但我们觉得，尽管已经超负荷工作了，只要还敦促自己做更多的事，就能减轻失落感。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是毋庸置疑的事实。所有在进化过程中已达到一定水平的人，一般都希望在正式工作计划之外也能有所成就。</td>
		<td class="en">And such is, indeed, the fact. The wish to accomplish something outside their formal programme is common to all men who in the course of evolution have risen past a certain level.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果不为实现那一愿望而作出努力，希望有所行动却迟迟未行动的焦躁感会一直干扰本应平静的心灵。人们给这种愿望起了很多名字。这是一种普遍的求知欲，其程度十分强烈，以至于那些全身心地、有计划有步骤地追求知识的人，在这一强烈愿望的驱使下，超越了他们的计划，求索更多的知识。包括我眼里迄今最伟大的思想家赫伯特.斯宾塞也经常在这种渴望的驱使下，沉浸于令人愉快的知识探求的小小静水湾之中。</td>
		<td class="en">Until an effort is made to satisfy that wish, the sense of uneasy waiting for something to start which has not started will remain to disturb the peace of the soul. That wish has been called by many names. It is one form of the universal desire for knowledge. And it is so strong that men whose whole lives have been given to the systematic acquirement of knowledge have been driven by it to overstep the limits of their programme in search of still more knowledge. Even Herbert Spencer2, in my opinion the greatest mind that ever lived, was often forced by it into agreeable little backwaters of inquiry.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我认为大多数有生活欲望的人，即对知识有好奇心的人，他们超越正式计划的渴望都以某种文学形式体现出来。他们愿意踏上读书的征程。肯定地说，英国人越来越热爱文学。但我想指出文学绝不代表全部知识，那种令人寝食难安的、想要提高自我的渴望——要增长知识——也可借由文学以外的其他途径得到满足。在后面的章节里我将谈到那些途径。在此我想向那些生性不喜欢文学的人指出，文学并不是满足求知欲的唯一源泉。</td>
		<td class="en">I imagine that in the majority of people who are conscious of the wish to live—that is to say, people who have intellectual curiosity—the aspiration to exceed formal programmes takes a literary shape. They would like to embark on a course of reading. Decidedly the British people are becoming more and more literary. But I would point out that literature by no means comprises the whole field of knowledge, and that the disturbing thirst to improve one’s self—to increase one’s knowledge—may well be slaked quite apart from literature. With the various ways of slaking I shall deal later. Here I merely point out to those who have no natural sympathy with literature that literature is not the only well.  </td></tr>

I can only deal with one case, and that case cannot be the average case, because there is no such case as the average case, just as there is no such man as the average man.

		<td class="en">But if I take the case of a Londoner who works in an office, whose office hours are from ten to six, and who spends fifty minutes morning and night in travelling between his house door and his office door, I shall have got as near to the average as facts permit.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我说的这位典型人士在对待每天的时间问题时，最严重的错误在于总体态度不对，这种错误损耗和减弱了他三分之二的精力和兴趣。大多数情况下他对工作没有热情；充其量不过是不厌恶罢了。到实在不能推托的时候，他才勉勉强强开工，然后早早地结束工作，结束时他可是欢欢喜喜。工作时，他极少全力以赴（我知道愤怒的读者会指控我诋毁这个城市的工薪一族；但我确实相当熟悉这座城市，我仍然坚持这个观点）。</td>
		<td class="en">Now the great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regard to his day is a mistake of general attitude, a mistake which vitiates and weakens two-thirds of his energies and interests. In the majority of instances he does not precisely feel a passion for his business; at best he does not dislike it. He begins his business functions with reluctance, as late as he can, and he ends them with joy, as early as he can. And his engines while he is engaged in his business are seldom at their full “h.p.1” (I know that I shall be accused by angry readers of traducing the city worker; but I am pretty thoroughly acquainted with the City, and I stick to what I say.)  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管这样，他还是坚持把10点到6点这段时间看成“一天”，之前的十小时以及之后的六小时只不过是序曲和尾章而已。这种态度，或许他自己都没意识到，自然会磨灭他对这剩余16小时的兴趣。因此，即使他没有浪费这16小时，却也没加以重视，不过把那段时间当作余暇而已。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet in spite of all this he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as “the day,” to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue. Such an attitude, unconscious though it be, of course kills his interest in the odd sixteen hours, with the result that, even if he does not waste them, he does not count them; he regards them simply as margin.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种态度完全缺乏逻辑，也不健康，因为这样一来生活重心就是那一段时间和那一连串的事情，当事人就一个想法，就是要“熬过去”和“完事”。如果一个人将时间的三分之二看成是另外三分之一的附庸，并且无可否认的是，在那三分之一的时间里他没有投入高度的热情，他又怎能指望过得充实美满？不可能。</td>
		<td class="en">This general attitude is utterly illogical and unhealthy, since it formally gives the central prominence to a patch of time and a bunch of activities which the man’s one idea is to “get through” and have “done with.” If a man makes two-thirds of his existence subservient to onethird, for which admittedly he has no absolutely feverish zest, how can he hope to live fully and completely? He cannot.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果这位典型人士想过得充实美满，他脑子里必须在一天之内还安排一天。这个内在的一天就像大中国盒子中的小中国盒子，从下午6点到第二天早上10点，共有16小时。在这16个小时中，他要全部用来加强身心健康，结交朋友；在这16个小时中，他自由自在，不是上班族，不必为生计发愁；他跟有额外收入的人一样。他必须抱持这样的态度，这是非常重要的。他一生成功与否（远比他的财产数目更重要，他的遗嘱执行人还要据此缴纳遗产税）就取决与此。</td>
		<td class="en">If my typical man wishes to live fully and completely he must, in his mind, arrange a day within a day. And this inner day, a Chinese box2 in a larger Chinese box, must begin at 6 p.m. and end at 10 a.m. It is a day of sixteen hours; and during all these sixteen hours he has nothing whatever to do but cultivate his body and his soul and his fellow men. During those sixteen hours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not preoccupied with monetary cares; he is just as good as a man with a private income. This must be his attitude. And his attitude is all important. His success in life (much more important than the amount of estate upon what his executors will have to pay estate duty) depends on it.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >什么？你说把全副精力投入到那16小时会降低8小时的工作效率？不然，正相反，这样会提高那8小时的工作效率。这位典型人士需要了解的主要事情之一即人的大脑能持续繁忙地工作，不会像手臂或大腿那样感到疲倦。大脑唯一需要的是调节——而不是休息，睡眠过程除外。</td>
		<td class="en">What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在我将探究这位代表人物是如何安排那完全属于他的16小时的，从他起床开始。我只想指出他所做的事情，以及我认为他不该有的举动，暂不建议如何“安置”我即将清理出来的时间——就像拓荒者在森林里开辟土地一样。</td>
		<td class="en">I shall now examine the typical man’s current method of employing the sixteen hours that are entirely his, beginning with his uprising. I will merely indicate things which he does and which I think he ought not to do, postponing my suggestions for “planting” the times which I shall have cleared—as a settler clears spaces in a forest.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >平心而论，我必须说他早上9点10分离开家之前，他几乎没有浪费一点时间。很多人都是9点起床，在9点零7分到9点零9分半钟之间吃完早餐，然后锁门。然而一旦他哐地一声关上前门，他不知疲倦的大脑就闲下来了。他步行至车站的路上，头脑一片空白。走进车站后，通常得等会儿。每天早上在数百个地铁站里，你会看见人们在月台上悠哉游哉地踱来踱去，铁路公司毫不歉疚地掠夺他们比金钱还宝贵的时间。每天不计其数的时间就这么浪费了，就因为这个典型人士对时间如此无动于衷，从未想过采取一些相当简单的预防措施阻止时间的流逝。</td>
		<td class="en">In justice to him I must say that he wastes very little time before he leaves the house in the morning at 9.10. In too many houses he gets up at nine, breakfasts between 9.7 and 9.9 1/2, and then bolts. But immediately he bangs the front door his mental faculties, which are tireless, become idle. He walks to the station in a condition of mental coma. Arrived there, he usually has to wait for the train. On hundreds of suburban stations every morning you see men calmly strolling up and down platforms while railway companies unblushingly rob them of time, which is more than money. Hundreds of thousands of hours are thus lost every day simply because my typical man thinks so little of time that it has never occurred to him to take quite easy precautions against the risk of its loss.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每天都是一块坚硬的时间硬币，可供他花费——就称它为一枚沙弗林金币吧。他必须把金币换成零钱，换零的过程中，他甘愿折损，哪怕折损很大。</td>
		<td class="en">He has a solid coin of time to spend every day—call it a sovereign3. He must get change for it, and in getting change he is content to lose heavily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >试想公司卖给他一张票后说：“我们为你兑换这枚金币，但我们要收取1.5便士的手续费。”这位典型人士会作怎样的抗议？可这与铁路公司每天两次夺去他五分钟并无二致。</td>
		<td class="en"> Supposing that in selling him a ticket the company said, “We will change you a sovereign, but we shall charge you three halfpence for doing so,” what would my typical man exclaim? Yet that is the equivalent of what the company does when it robs him of five minutes twice a day.  </td></tr>

		<td class="en">You get into the morning train with your newspaper, and you calmly and majestically give yourself up to your newspaper. You do not hurry. You know you have at least half an hour of security in front of you. As your glance lingers idly at the advertisements of shipping and of songs on the outer pages, your air is the air of a leisured man, wealthy in time, of a man from some planet where there are a hundred and twenty-four hours a day instead of twenty-four. I am an impassioned reader of newspapers. I read five English and two French dailies, and the news-agents alone know how many weeklies, regularly. I am obliged to mention this personal fact lest I should be accused of a prejudice against newspapers when I say that I object to the reading of newspapers in the morning train. Newspapers are produced with rapidity, to be read with rapidity. There is no place in my daily programme for newspapers. I read them as I may in odd moments. But I do read them. The idea of devoting to them thirty or forty consecutive minutes of wonderful solitude (for nowhere can one more perfectly immerse one’s self in one’s self than in a compartment full of silent, withdrawn, smoking males) is to me repugnant. I cannot possibly allow you to scatter priceless pearls of time with such Oriental lavishness. You are not the Shah of time. Let me respectfully remind you that you have no more time than I have. No newspaper reading in trains! I have already “put by” about three-quarters of an hour for use.  </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I meet you again as you emerge from your office. You are pale and tired. At any rate, your wife says you are pale, and you give her to understand that you are tired. During the journey home you have been gradually working up the tired feeling. The tired feeling hangs heavy over the mighty suburbs of London like a virtuous and melancholy cloud, particularly in winter. You don’t eat immediately on your arrival home. But in about an hour or so you feel as if you could sit up and take a little nourishment. And you do. Then you smoke, seriously; you see friends; you potter; you play cards; you flirt with a book; you note that old age is creeping on; you take a stroll; you caress the piano.... By Jove! a quarter past eleven. You then devote quite forty minutes to thinking about going to bed; and it is conceivable that you are acquainted with a genuinely good whisky. At last you go to bed, exhausted by the day’s work. Six hours, probably more, have gone since you left the office— gone like a dream, gone like magic, unaccountably gone!  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是一个很典型的例子。但你说：“随你怎么说，但我确实疲惫了，也必须见朋友，不能总是把弦绷得紧紧的。”言之有理。然而假如你去剧院看戏（特别是同漂亮女人一道），情况会怎样呢？你匆忙赶去郊区，费尽周折翻腾出漂亮的衣服，把自己打扮得光鲜体面，又乘下一辆车赶回城里；这样纵使不是五个小时，也至少有四个小时你的精神都很紧张；你把她送回家，然后自己才回家，你不会花45分钟时间去“考虑”该不该睡觉，就立刻上床了。朋友和疲惫都被抛诸脑后，那个夜晚对你来说是多么漫长（或特别短暂）！可曾记得你在别人的劝说下参加业余剧团大合唱，三个月里隔天的晚上都艰苦训练两小时的日子？黄昏时分有所期盼，要全副精力地去做事——想到这就令你整天的生活焕然生辉，活力倍增，你能否认这一点吗？</td>
		<td class="en">That is a fair sample case. But you say: “It’s all very well for you to talk. A man is tired. A man must see his friends. He can’t always be on the stretch.” Just so. But when you arrange to go to the theatre (especially with a pretty woman) what happens? You rush to the suburbs; you spare no toil to make yourself glorious in fine raiment; you rush back to town in another train; you keep yourself on the stretch for four hours, if not five; you take her home; you take yourself home. You don’t spend three-quarters of an hour in “thinking about” going to bed. You go. Friends and fatigue have equally been forgotten, and the evening has seemed so exquisitely long (or perhaps too short)!

But I do suggest that you might, for a commencement, employ an hour and a half every other evening in some important and consecutive cultivation of the mind. You will still be left with three evenings for friends, bridge, tennis, domestic scenes, odd reading, pipes, gardening, pottering, and prize competitions. You will still have the terrific wealth of forty-four hours between 2 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. Monday. If you persevere you will soon want to pass four evenings, and perhaps five, in some sustained endeavour to be genuinely alive. And you will fall out of that habit of muttering to yourself at 11.15 p.m., “Time to be thinking about going to bed.” The man who begins to go to bed forty minutes before he opens his bedroom door is bored; that is to say, he is not living.  </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I suggest no particular work as a start. The attempt would be futile in the space of my command. But I have two general suggestions of a certain importance. The first is to define the direction and scope of your efforts. Choose a limited period, or a limited subject, or a single author. Say to yourself: “I will know something about the French Revolution, or the rise of railways, or the works of John Keats3.” And during a given period, to be settled beforehand, conf ine yourself to your choice. There is much pleasure to be derived from being a specialist.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其二，要边读边想。我知道有的人会不停地读啊读，但读书的所得却比他们切切面包和黄油学到的多不了多少。他们热爱阅读就像好酒之徒沉湎于饮酒一样。他们驾车在文学领域里翱翔，唯一的目标就是运动。他们会告诉你一年里他们读了多少书。</td>
		<td class="en">The second suggestion is to think as well as to read. I know people who read and read, and for all the good it does them they might just as well cut bread-and-butter. They take to reading as better men take to drink. They fly through the shires of literature on a motor-car, their sole object being motion. They will tell you how many books they have read in a year.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除非花上至少45分钟来细心地、甚至是有些令人疲惫地思考你所读的内容（起初你会觉得相当乏味），否则，你一晚上90分钟的时间基本上就被浪费了。这意味着你将进展缓慢。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >关于如何利用时间以达到美好的生活境界（而不是像植物人一样过活）的建议，恐怕自己过于说教、毫不谦卑、不太连贯，但我还是不能就此结束，必须简短地谈谈对人生抱着真诚热望的人们可能遭遇的某些危险。第一个可怕的危险是成为最讨厌、最不受欢迎的人——假正经。这种人鲁莽无礼，总是摆出一幅有极高智商的神态。这种人是自命不凡的傻瓜，走在外面，会煞有介事地昂首阔步，浑然不觉自己的矫饰中缺乏很重要的一部分，也就是幽默感。这种乏味的家伙要是有什么发现，就会视之为伟大的壮举，如若他人对此不以为然，他就大为不快。人们很容易不自觉地变成这样的人，这是致命的危险。</td>
		<td class="en">I cannot terminate these hints, often, I fear, too didactic and abrupt, upon the full use of one’s time to the great end of living (as distinguished from vegetating) without briefly referring to certain dangers which lie in wait for the sincere aspirant towards life. The first is the terrible danger of becoming that most odious and least supportable of persons—a prig. Now a prig is a pert fellow who gives himself airs of superior wisdom. A prig is a pompous fool who has gone out for a ceremonial walk, and without knowing it has lost an important part of his attire, namely, his sense of humour. A prig is a tedious individual who, having made a discovery, is so impressed by his discovery that he is capable of being gravely displeased because the entire world is not also impressed by it. Unconsciously to become a prig is an easy and a fatal thing.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，当一个人要展开好好利用自己时间的大业时，记住时间是自己的，不是别人的，你要自己安排。你对时间做出平衡预算之前，地球一直在顺利运转；不论你是否胜任时间的财务大臣这一新职务，地球还是会一如既往地运转。切莫过多念叨自己正在做的事情；也不要因为看到整个世界每天故意浪费这么多时间而没有真正的生活，就感到过分悲伤并形诸于色。最终你将发现，只要管好自己分内的事，你就尽了最大努力。</td>
		<td class="en">Hence, when one sets forth on the enterprise of using all one’s time, it is just as well to remember that one’s own time, and not other people’s time, is the material with which one has to deal; that the earth rolled on pretty comfortably before one began to balance a budget of the hours, and that it will continue to roll on pretty comfortably whether or not one succeeds in one’s new role of chancellor of the exchequer of time. It is as well not to chatter too much about what one is doing, and not to betray a too-pained sadness at the spectacle of a whole world deliberately wasting so many hours out of every day, and therefore never really living. It will be found, ultimately, that in taking care of one’s self one has quite all one can do.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一危险就是被计划捆缚，仿佛是拉马车的奴隶。计划不能超出一个人所能承受的范围。必须尊重计划，但不能将它奉为神明；每天要施行的计划并非宗教。</td>
		<td class="en">Another danger is the danger of being tied to a programme like a slave to a chariot. One’s programme must not be allowed to run away with one. It must be respected, but it must not be worshipped as a fetish. A programme of daily employ is not a religion.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这似乎显而易见。然而我知道正因为有些人不懂得这道理，不仅自己背包袱，他们的亲人朋友也因此甚为恼火。“哦，不，”我曾听一位备受折磨的妻子抱怨道，“亚瑟总是8点钟出去遛狗，9点差一刻开始读书，所以我们毫无疑问是应该……”等等、等等。这种悲哀的控诉流露出绝对要终结的意味，显示出一项事业的悲剧性，始料不及又滑稽可笑。</td>
		<td class="en">This seems obvious. Yet I know men whose lives are a burden to themselves and a distressing burden to their relatives and friends simply because they have failed to appreciate the obvious. “Oh, no,” I have heard the martyred wife exclaim, “Arthur always takes the dog out for exercise at eight o’clock and he always begins to read at a quarter to nine. So it’s quite out of the question that we should…” etc., etc. And the note of absolute finality in that plaintive voice reveals the unsuspected and ridiculous tragedy of a career.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一方面，计划就是计划。若不遵从计划，计划就不成其为计划，只是个蹩脚的玩笑罢了。适当地遵从计划，不必过度紧张，也不能太过于放松，对没有经验的人而言，这说起来简单，做起来难。</td>
		<td class="en">On the other hand, a programme is a programme. And unless it is treated with deference it ceases to be anything but a poor joke. To treat one’s programme with exactly the right amount of deference, to live with not too much and not too little elasticity, is scarcely the simple affair it may appear to the inexperienced.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一危险就是变得匆忙，被一件件接踵而来的事情困住。这样一来就仿佛身陷牢笼，生活不再属于自己。8点钟出去遛狗，可整个过程中都在想必须9点差一刻开始看书，千万不能耽误。</td>
		<td class="en">And still another danger is the danger of developing a policy of rush, of being gradually more and more obsessed by what one has to do next. In this way one may come to exist as in a prison, and one’s life may cease to be one’s own. One may take the dog out for a walk at eight o’clock, and meditate the whole time on the fact that one must begin to read at a quarter to nine, and that one must not be late.  </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时故意不按计划行事也于事无补。罪恶并非源于一板一眼的坚持，而是源于从一开始贪求太多，把计划填得满满的以致满溢出来。唯一的办法是重定计划，降低企望。</td>
		<td class="en">And the occasional deliberate breaking of one’s programme will not help to mend matters. The evil springs not from persisting without elasticity in what one has attempted, but from originally attempting too much, from filling one’s programme till it runs over.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >无论怎样，如果计划让人觉得压抑，而这个人又不愿更改计划，一大良方就是把一部分时间极其从容地挪到其他地方；比如，从圣.伯纳德大街回来后、打开书本之前，花五分钟时间让大脑彻底休息；换句话说，刻意浪费这五分钟时间。</td>
		<td class="en">In any case, if the programme exhibits a tendency to be oppressive, and yet one wishes not to modify it, an excellent palliative is to pass with exaggerated deliberation from one portion of it to another; for example, to spend five minutes in perfect mental quiescence between chaining up the St. Bernard and opening the book; in other words, to waste five minutes with the entire consciousness of wasting them.  </td></tr>
