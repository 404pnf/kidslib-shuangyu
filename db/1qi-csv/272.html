		<td class="en">Bald-Summit.—Introductory to @The Chimera@</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尤斯塔斯·布赖特和他的同伴们沿着陡峭、树木繁茂的山坡往上爬。树上的叶子还没长满，但是那些小芽足以投下斑驳的阴影，在太阳的照耀下显得十分青翠。有些岩石长满了青苔，半露在旧的、暗棕色的落叶中；有些腐朽的树干横躺在很久以前倒下的地方；还有一些被冬季寒风吹下来的枯枝，被分散得到处都是。然而，尽管这些景象看起来十分古老，但树林整体的景致还是生机勃勃；因为，不论你怎样四处张望，总有一些清新、翠绿的东西映入眼帘，准备迎接夏天的到来。</td>
		<td class="en">Upward, along the steep and wooded hill-side, went Eustace Bright and his companions.The trees were not yet in full leaf, but had budded forth sufficiently to throw an airy shadow, while the sunshine filled them with green light.There were moss-grown rocks, half hidden among the old, brown, fallen leaves; there were rotten tree-trunks, lying at full length where they had long ago fallen; there were decayed boughs, that had been shaken down by the wintry gales, and were scattered everywhere about.But still, though these things looked so aged, the aspect of the wood was that of the newest life; for, whichever way you turned your eyes, something fresh and green was springing forth, so as to be ready for the summer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于，这伙年轻人到达了树林的上缘，这时他们发现已经快到山顶了。山顶并不是一个尖峰，也不是一个大而圆的山包，而是一片相当空旷的平地，像桌子一样平，不远处有一座房子和一个谷仓。那所房子里住着孤零零的一家人，常常在下雨时，或暴风雪刮下山的时候，云就会压得比这所荒凉而又孤单的房子还要低。</td>
		<td class="en">At last, the young people reached the upper verge of the wood, and found themselves almost at the summit of the hill.It was not a peak, nor a great round ball, but a pretty wide plain, or table-land, with a house and barn upon it, at some distance.That house was the home of a solitary family; and oftentimes the clouds, whence fell the rain, and whence the snow-storm drifted down into the valley, hung lower than this bleak and lonely dwelling-place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >山的最高处有一堆石头，石头中间插着一根长长的旗杆，它的顶端飘着一面小旗子。尤斯塔斯带着孩子们到那里，并命令他们环顾四周，看看一眼就可以领略到的广袤而美丽的世界。孩子们越看，眼睛张得越大。</td>
		<td class="en">On the highest point of the hill was a heap of stones, in the centre of which was stuck a long pole, with a little flag fluttering at the end of it.Eustace led the children thither, and bade them look around, and see how large a tract of our beautiful world they could take in at a glance.And their eyes grew wider as they looked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >南面的莫纽门特山仍然屹立在景色的中心，但似乎已经有点下沉和消退，所以现在它在一大群峰峦中一点也不起眼了。而莫纽门特山另一边的塔科尼克山看起来比以往更高大，更巍峨。美丽的湖泊，以及它所有的小湾和小支流都可以一览无余；不仅如此，还有两三个新湖泊正向太阳睁着蓝色的眼睛。远处分布着几个白色的村庄，每个村庄都能看到村内教堂的尖塔。还有许许多多的农舍和周围大量的林地、牧场、草地以及耕地，以至于孩子们已无足够的精力去欣赏它们。当然了，也有坦格尔伍德镇，迄今为止他们一直认为那是世界一个重要的城市。它现在只占据着非常小的一块地方，因此孩子们都往比它实际更远的地方看，在两侧仔细地找了半天，才发现了它的位置。</td>
		<td class="en">Monument Mountain, to the southward, was still in the centre of the scene, but seemed to have sunk and subsided, so that it was now but an undistinguished member of a large family of hills.Beyond it, the Taconic range looked higher and bulkier than before.Our pretty lake was seen, with all its little bays and inlets; and not that alone, but two or three new lakes were opening their blue eyes to the sun.Several white villages, each with its steeple, were scattered about in the distance.There were so many farm-houses, with their acres of woodland, pasture, mowing-fields, and tillage, that the children could hardly make room in their minds to receive all these different objects.There, too, was Tanglewood, which they had hitherto thought such an important apex of the world.It now occupied so small a space, that they gazed far beyond it, and on either side, and searched a good while with all their eyes, before discovering whereabout it stood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天空中悬浮着羊毛般的白云，在大地上投下这一片那一片的阴影。但是，当阳光逐渐照在阴影出现的地方时，阴影就又跑到了其他地方。</td>
		<td class="en">White, fleecy clouds were hanging in the air, and threw the dark spots of their shadow here and there over the landscape.But, by and by, the sunshine was where the shadow had been, and the shadow was somewhere else.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >向西望去，远处是连绵起伏的蓝色山脉，尤斯塔斯·布赖特告诉孩子们那是卡茨基尔山。他说，就在那些云雾缭绕的山峦中的一块地方，有几个老荷兰人在那里玩过一场持续很久的九柱戏游戏，还有一个叫里普·范温克尔的懒人在那里睡过觉，而且一觉竟睡了二十年。孩子们热切地恳求尤斯塔斯给他们讲讲这个神奇的故事。可是这个学生回答他们说，这个故事已经被别人讲过了，而且讲得十分完美，所以任何人都没有权利修改一个字，除非等到它像《戈耳戈的头》、《三个金苹果》以及其他传奇的神话故事一样历史悠久。</td>
		<td class="en">Far to the westward was a range of blue mountains, which Eustace Bright told the children were the Catskills.Among those misty hills, he said, was a spot where some old Dutchmen were playing an everlasting game of nine-pins, and where an idle fellow, whose name was Rip Van Winkle, had fallen asleep, and slept twenty years at a stretch.The children eagerly besought Eustace to tell them all about this wonderful affair.But the student replied that the story had been told once already, and better than it ever could be told again; and that nobody would have a right to alter a word of it, until it should have grown as old as “The Gorgon’s Head,” and “The Three Golden Apples,” and the rest of those miraculous legends.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“至少，”长春花说，“我们在这里休息、欣赏风景时，你可以给我们讲一个你自己的故事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“At least,” said Periwinkle, “while we rest ourselves here, and are looking about us, you can tell us another of your own stories.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，尤斯塔斯表哥，”报春花大声说道，“我建议你在这儿给我们讲个故事。找一个特别的或不同寻常的题目，看看你的想象力能不能跟得上。或许山上的空气能让你变得诗意呢一回呢。不管你的故事有多么奇怪，多么不可思议，既然我们到了山顶，置身云端，就什么都相信。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, Cousin Eustace,” cried Primrose, “I advise you to tell us a story here.Take some lofty subject or other, and see if your imagination will not come up to it.Perhaps the mountain air may make you poetical, for once.And no matter how strange and wonderful the story may be, now that we are up among the clouds, we can believe anything.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你相信吗，”尤斯塔斯问道，“从前有一匹马长着翅膀？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Can you believe,” asked Eustace, “that there was once a winged horse?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“相信！”调皮的报春花说，“但我觉得你恐怕永远都逮不住它吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” said saucy Primrose; “but I am afraid you will never be able to catch him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有你这句话，报春花，”这个学生反驳道，“我也许能逮住珀加索斯，而且还能骑到它背上，我还知道其他十二个人也能做到。不管怎样，这个故事是关于这匹马的，与世界各地相比，在一个山顶上讲它的故事最合适不过了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“For that matter, Primrose,” rejoined the student, “I might possibly catch Pegasus, and get upon his back, too, as well as a dozen other fellows that I know of.At any rate, here is a story about him; and, of all places in the world, it ought certainly to be told upon a mountain-top.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，尤斯塔斯坐在那堆石头上，孩子们则在石头的底部围坐了下来，他凝视着一片飘来的白云，开始讲起来。</td>
		<td class="en">So, sitting on the pile of stones, while the children clustered themselves at its base, Eustace fixed his eyes on a white cloud that was sailing by, and began as follows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >客迈拉</td>
		<td class="en">The Chimera</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很久很久以前（我给你们讲的所有奇怪的事情都发生在没人能记得住的、很久以前的过去），在希腊那片神奇的土地上，有一股喷泉从一个山坡上涌了出来。也许，在过了许多个千年之后，它还是从同一个地方汩汩流出。总之，那里有一股欢快的喷泉，清新纯净的泉水汩汩流出，顺着山坡向下，在金色的落日晚霞中闪闪发光。此时，一个名叫柏勒洛丰的英俊青年走近泉边。他手里拿着一个马勒，上面镶满了光彩夺目的宝石，还配有金色的马嚼子。在泉边，他看到一个老人、一个中年人、一个小男孩，还有一个正用罐子打水的姑娘。他停了下来，请求姑娘给他喝点水提提神。</td>
		<td class="en">Once, in the old, old times (for all the strange things which I tell you about happened long before anybody can remember), a fountain gushed out of a hill-side, in the marvelous land of Greece.And, for aught I know, after so many thousand years, it is still gushing out of the very selfsame spot.At any rate, there was the pleasant fountain, welling freshly forth and sparkling adown the hill-side, in the golden sunset, when a handsome young man named Bellerophon drew near its margin.In his hand he held a bridle, studded with brilliant gems, and adorned with a golden bit.Seeing an old man, and another of middle age, and a little boy, near the fountain, and likewise a maiden, who was dipping up some of the water in a pitcher, he paused, and begged that he might refresh himself with a draught.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这水真甜，”他喝完之后，一边涮了罐子，重新打满水，一边对少女说道。“请问您能告诉我这个泉是否有名字吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“This is very delicious water,” he said to the maiden as he rinsed and filled her pitcher, after drinking out of it.“Will you be kind enough to tell me whether the fountain has any name?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有，它叫碧莉妮泉，”姑娘说，然后她又补充道，“我的祖母告诉我这股清澈的泉水曾经是个漂亮的女人。自从她的儿子被女猎人狄安娜用箭射死后，她就整个人都化成了泪水。所以你喝的这清凉而又甘甜的泉水，实际上是那个可怜的母亲心中的悲伤！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes; it is called the Fountain of Pirene,” answered the maiden; and then she added, “My grandmother has told me that this clear fountain was once a beautiful woman; and when her son was killed by the arrows of the huntress Diana, she melted all away into tears.And so the water, which you find so cool and sweet, is the sorrow of that poor mother’s heart!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我做梦也不会想到，”这位年轻的陌生人说道，“这么清澈的泉水，从阴凉处涌出流淌到阳光下，欢快地舞蹈，心中会有这么多的眼泪！那么，这就是碧莉妮吗？美丽的姑娘，谢谢你告诉我它的名字。我从很远的国家来，就是为了寻找这个地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I should not have dreamed,” observed the young stranger, “that so clear a well-spring, with its gush and gurgle, and its cheery dance out of the shade into the sunlight, had so much as one tear-drop in its bosom!And this, then, is Pirene?I thank you, pretty maiden, for telling me its name.I have come from a far-away country to find this very spot.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个中年农夫（牵着他的牛来泉边饮牛）一直盯着年轻的柏勒洛丰和他手里漂亮的马勒。</td>
		<td class="en">A middle-aged country fellow (he had driven his cow to drink out of the spring) stared hard at young Bellerophon, and at the handsome bridle which he carried in his hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友，如果你大老远来这儿只为找到碧莉妮泉的话，”他评论道，“那么你家乡的河道水位一定是在下降啊。不过，请问，你是不是丢了匹马啊？我看到你手里拿着马勒，而且有那两排闪亮的宝石装饰，它可真漂亮！如果马和这马勒一样出众，你丢了它真是太可惜了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The water-courses must be getting low, friend, in your part of the world,” remarked he, “if you come so far only to find the Fountain of Pirene.But, pray, have you lost a horse?I see you carry the bridle in your hand; and a very pretty one it is with that double row of bright stones upon it.If the horse was as fine as the bridle, you are much to be pitied for losing him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我没丢过马，”柏勒洛丰微笑着说，“不过我正好在寻找一匹非常有名的马。智者告诉我，要是能找到它的话，一定是在这附近。你们知不知道那匹长着翅膀的马，珀加索斯，是否还像你们祖先时代那样，在碧莉妮泉水一带出没？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have lost no horse,” said Bellerophon, with a smile.“But I happen to be seeking a very famous one, which, as wise people have informed me, must be found hereabouts, if anywhere.Do you know whether the winged horse Pegasus still haunts the Fountain of Pirene, as he used to do in your forefathers’ days?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可这时那个农夫笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">But then the country fellow laughed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我年轻的朋友们，你们中也许有人听说过，珀加索斯是一匹雪白的骏马，背上长着一对银色而美丽的翅膀，它大部分时间都呆在赫利孔山上。它在空中飞翔时，就像天上的雄鹰一样直入云霄，狂野、敏捷且充满活力。世界上没有哪一匹马能比得上它。它没有伴侣，也从没有主人给它套马勒或骑它。许多年来，它过着孤单而又快乐的生活。</td>
		<td class="en">Some of you, my little friends, have probably heard that this Pegasus was a snow-white steed, with beautiful silvery wings, who spent most of his time on the summit of Mount Helicon.He was as wild, and as swift, and as buoyant, in his flight through the air, as any eagle that ever soared into the clouds.There was nothing else like him in the world.He had no mate; he never had been backed or bridled by a master; and, for many a long year, he led a solitary and a happy life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >啊，做一匹双翼飞马是一件多么幸福的事呀！它晚上在巍峨的高山上睡觉，白天大部分的时光在空中翱翔，珀加索斯看上去几乎不是一个地面上的动物。不论何时，当看到它在人们头顶上方的高空中，阳光洒在它银色的翅膀上，你就会觉得它属于天空。如果飞翔的高度低一些，你会觉得它在迷雾与水汽中失去了方向，正在寻找归家的路。如果你看到它纵身跃入灿烂而轻柔的云彩中并消失不见，一会儿又看到它从云的另一端冲出来，那情景真是十分漂亮。或者在阴沉的暴风雨天气里，空中乌云密布，有时双翼飞马会正好穿云而降，较高的区域会在它身后闪耀着欢乐的光芒。下一刻，珀加索斯和那欢快的光芒就会一同隐去，这是真的。但是如果有谁足够幸运，能看到这一神奇的景象，那么他就会在接下来的一整天都兴高采烈，而且比暴风雨持续的时间长得多。</td>
		<td class="en">Oh, how fine a thing it is to be a winged horse!Sleeping at night, as he did, on a lofty mountain-top, and passing the greater part of the day in the air, Pegasus seemed hardly to be a creature of the earth.Whenever he was seen, up very high above people’s heads, with the sunshine on his silvery wings, you would have thought that he belonged to the sky, and that, skimming a little too low, he had got astray among our mists and vapors, and was seeking his way back again.It was very pretty to behold him plunge into the fleecy bosom of a bright cloud, and be lost in it, for a moment or two, and then break forth from the other side.Or, in a sullen rain-storm, when there was a gray pavement of clouds over the whole sky, it would sometimes happen that the winged horse descended right through it, and the glad light of the upper region would gleam after him.In another instant, it is true, both Pegasus and the pleasant light would be gone away together.But any one that was fortunate enough to see this wondrous spectacle felt cheerful the whole day afterwards, and as much longer as the storm lasted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >夏天，在最美好的天气里，珀加索斯经常降落在厚实的大地上，收起它银色的羽翼，风一般地翻山越岭、嬉戏作乐。它被看到次数最多的地方就是在碧莉妮泉附近，饮着甘美的泉水，或是在泉边柔软的草地上来回打着滚。有时候，它也会吃几朵碰巧非常香甜的红花草的花（不过，珀加索斯对食物还是很讲究的）。</td>
		<td class="en">In the summer-time, and in the beautifullest of weather, Pegasus often alighted on the solid earth, and, closing his silvery wings, would gallop over hill and dale for pastime, as fleetly as the wind.Oftener than in any other place, he had been seen near the Fountain of Pirene, drinking the delicious water, or rolling himself upon the soft grass of the margin.Sometimes, too (but Pegasus was very dainty in his food), he would crop a few of the clover-blossoms that happened to be sweetest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，人们的曾祖父辈们常有去碧莉妮泉的习惯（那时他们还年轻，对双翼飞马的存在深信不疑），他们都希望能看一眼美丽的珀加索斯。但是，近几年来，人们很少能看到它了。事实上，很多村民的住所离喷泉只有不到半个小时的路程，但他们从没见过珀加索斯，他们也根本不相信世界上有这样的生物存在。此时和柏勒洛丰说话的农夫恰好就是这样一个不相信飞马的人。</td>
		<td class="en">To the Fountain of Pirene, therefore, people’s great-grandfathers had been in the habit of going (as long as they were youthful, and retained their faith in winged horses), in hopes of getting a glimpse at the beautiful Pegasus.But, of late years, he had been very seldom seen.Indeed, there were many of the country folks, dwelling within half an hour’s walk of the fountain, who had never beheld Pegasus, and did not believe that there was any such creature in existence.The country fellow to whom Bellerophon was speaking chanced to be one of those incredulous persons.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这也是他为什么会笑的原因。</td>
		<td class="en">And that was the reason why he laughed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“珀加索斯，真是！”他把扁平的鼻子努力扬起到最高点，大声地说，“珀加索斯，真是的！一匹长着翅膀的马，真是！哎呀，朋友，你神志清楚吗？马长翅膀干什么？你想想，有翅膀的马怎么能拉好犁呢？当然了，这也许会省点马掌钱。但是，有谁喜欢看到自己的马从马厩的窗户里飞出去呢？是啊，或者主人只想骑着马去磨房，而飞马却突然把他驮到了天上？不，不！我不相信会有珀加索斯飞马。世上绝不会有这种既是马又是鸟的荒唐东西！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pegasus, indeed!” cried he, turning up his nose as high as such a flat nose could be turned up,—“Pegasus, indeed!A winged horse, truly!Why, friend, are you in your senses?Of what use would wings be to a horse?Could he drag the plow so well, think you?To be sure, there might be a little saving in the expense of shoes; but then, how would a man like to see his horse flying out of the stable window?—yes, or whisking up him above the clouds, when he only wanted to ride to mill?No, no!I don’t believe in Pegasus.There never was such a ridiculous kind of a horse-fowl made!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我有理由有不同的想法。”柏勒洛丰平静地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I have some reason to think otherwise,” said Bellerophon, quietly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他转向一个头发花白的老人，老人正倚在一根拐杖上专心致志地听着，头向前倾，一只手放在耳朵上，因为近二十年来，他的耳朵越来越不好使了。</td>
		<td class="en">And then he turned to an old, gray man, who was leaning on a staff, and listening very attentively, with his head stretched forward, and one hand at his ear, because, for the last twenty years, he had been getting rather deaf.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“尊敬的先生，您有什么看法呢？”他问道，“我可以想象出，在您年轻时，您一定可以经常看见那长着翅膀的骏马！”</td>
		<td class="en">“And what say you, venerable sir?” inquired he.“In your younger days, I should imagine, you must frequently have seen the winged steed!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，年轻的外地人，我的记性很差！”老人说，“如果我没记错的话，在我年轻时，我和大家一样都相信有这样一匹飞马。但现在，我几乎不知道该想些什么，更别说想起那匹飞马了。即便是我见过那东西，也是很久很久以前的事了。说老实话，我不确定自己真的曾经见过它。的确，在我还很年轻时，有一天，我记得在泉边看到过马蹄印子。可能是珀加索斯留下的，也可能其他的马踩的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah, young stranger, my memory is very poor!” said the aged man.“When I was a lad, if I remember rightly, I used to believe there was such a horse, and so did everybody else.But, nowadays, I hardly know what to think, and very seldom think about the winged horse at all.If I ever saw the creature, it was a long, long while ago; and, to tell you the truth, I doubt whether I ever did see him.One day, to be sure, when I was quite a youth, I remember seeing some hoof-tramps round about the brink of the fountain.Pegasus might have made those hoof-marks; and so might some other horse.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“美丽的姑娘，你从没见过它吗？”柏勒洛丰问那个一直头顶着水罐听他们谈话的姑娘，“如果有谁能见着珀加索斯的话，你也一定能，因为你的眼睛如此明亮。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And have you never seen him, my fair maiden?” asked Bellerophon of the girl, who stood with the pitcher on her head, while this talk went on.“You certainly could see Pegasus, if anybody can, for your eyes are very bright.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我觉得有一次我见着它了，”姑娘微笑着答道，脸还红了，“可能是珀加索斯，也可能是一只大白鸟，在很远很高的天空中飞着。还有一次，我带着水罐来泉边，听到一声马的嘶鸣。啊，那嘶鸣声如此欢快、如此优美！听到它的叫声，我激动得心跳不已。但是，那声音吓到我了，所以我没打水就跑回家了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Once I thought I saw him,” replied the maiden, with a smile and a blush.“It was either Pegasus, or a large white bird, a very great way up in the air.And one other time, as I was coming to the fountain with my pitcher, I heard a neigh.Oh, such a brisk and melodious neigh as that was!My very heart leaped with delight at the sound.But it startled me, nevertheless; so that I ran home without filling my pitcher.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那实在是可惜啊！”柏勒洛丰说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“That was truly a pity!” said Bellerophon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他又转向那个我们在故事的开端就提到过的小男孩。他大张着红润的嘴巴正盯着柏勒洛丰，因为小孩子都喜欢盯着陌生人看。</td>
		<td class="en">And he turned to the child, whom I mentioned at the beginning of the story, and who was gazing at him, as children are apt to gaze at strangers, with his rosy mouth wide open.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，小朋友，”柏勒洛丰打趣地拽拽他的一缕卷发，大声说，“我觉得你经常能看见那匹双翼飞马。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, my little fellow,” cried Bellerophon, playfully pulling one of his curls, “I suppose you have often seen the winged horse.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我见过的，”小孩非常迅速地回答，“我昨天还见它了呢，以前也见过好多次。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That I have,” answered the child, very readily.“I saw him yesterday, and many times before.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真是个了不起的小家伙！”柏勒洛丰边说边把孩子拉到他的身边，“来，都讲给我听听。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are a fine little man!” said Bellerophon, drawing the child closer to him.“Come, tell me all about it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，”小孩子回答道，“我经常来这里往泉水里放小船，还从水底收集漂亮的鹅卵石。有时候，在我低头看着水面的时候，我就能从天空在水中的倒影里看到双翼飞马的身影。我真希望它能落下来，把我驮在背上，带我到月亮上去！但是，如果我搅动一下想看看他的话，它就飞得远远的，无影无踪了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why,” replied the child, “I often come here to sail little boats in the fountain, and to gather pretty pebbles out of its basin.And sometimes, when I look down into the water, I see the image of the winged horse, in the picture of the sky that is there.I wish he would come down, and take me on his back, and let me ride him up to the moon!But, if I so much as stir to look at him, he flies far away out of sight.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >柏勒洛丰完全相信这个说在水中看到过珀加索斯倒影的孩子，他也相信那个姑娘，她说她听到过飞马动听的嘶鸣声，他却不去理会那个只看重拉车的马的中年乡下人，还有那个忘掉自己年轻时代美好事物的老人。</td>
		<td class="en">And Bellerophon put his faith in the child, who had seen the image of Pegasus in the water, and in the maiden, who had heard him neigh so melodiously, rather than in the middle-aged clown, who believed only in cart-horses, or in the old man who had forgotten the beautiful things of his youth.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In an instant, the winged horse shot almost out of sight, soaring straight upward from the summit of Mount Helicon.Being long after sunset, it was now twilight on the mountain-top, and dusky evening over all the country round about.But Pegasus flew so high that he overtook the departed day, and was bathed in the upper radiance of the sun.Ascending higher and higher, he looked like a bright speck, and, at last, could no longer be seen in the hollow waste of the sky.And Bellerophon was afraid that he should never behold him more.But, while he was lamenting his own folly, the bright speck reappeared, and drew nearer and nearer, until it descended lower than the sunshine; and, behold, Pegasus had come back!After this trial there was no more fear of the winged horse’s making his escape.He and Bellerophon were friends, and put loving faith in one another.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In this manner, Bellerophon and the wondrous steed spent several days, and grew better acquainted and fonder of each other all the time.They went on long aerial journeys, and sometimes ascended so high that the earth looked hardly bigger than the moon.They visited distant countries, and amazed the inhabitants, who thought that the beautiful young man, on the back of the winged horse, must have come down out of the sky.A thousand miles a day was no more than an easy space for the fleet Pegasus to pass over.Bellerophon was delighted with this kind of life, and would have liked nothing better than to live always in the same way, aloft in the clear atmosphere; for it was always sunny weather up there, however cheerless and rainy it might be in the lower region.But he could not forget the horrible Chimera, which he had promised King Iobates to slay.So, at last, when he had become well accustomed to feats of horsemanship in the air, and could manage Pegasus with the least motion of his hand, and had taught him to obey his voice, he determined to attempt the performance of this perilous adventure.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As soon as they had eaten their morning meal, and drank some sparkling water from a spring called Hippocrene, Pegasus held out his head, of his own accord, so that his master might put on the bridle.Then, with a great many playful leaps and airy caperings, he showed his impatience to be gone; while Bellerophon was girding on his sword, and hanging his shield about his neck, and preparing himself for battle.When everything was ready, the rider mounted, and (as was his custom, when going a long distance) ascended five miles perpendicularly, so as the better to see whither he was directing his course.He then turned the head of Pegasus towards the east, and set out for Lycia.In their flight they overtook an eagle, and came so nigh him, before he could get out of their way, that Bellerophon might easily have caught him by the leg.Hastening onward at this rate, it was still early in the forenoon when they beheld the lofty mountains of Lycia, with their deep and shaggy valleys.If Bellerophon had been told truly, it was in one of those dismal valleys that the hideous Chimera had taken up its abode.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Being now so near their journey’s end, the winged horse gradually descended with his rider; and they took advantage of some clouds that were floating over the mountain-tops, in order to conceal themselves.Hovering on the upper surface of a cloud, and peeping over its edge, Bellerophon had a pretty distinct view of the mountainous part of Lycia, and could look into all its shadowy vales at once.At first there appeared to be nothing remarkable.It was a wild, savage, and rocky tract of high and precipitous hills.In the more level part of the country, there were the ruins of houses that had been burnt, and, here and there, the carcasses of dead cattle, strewn about the pastures where they had been feeding.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As I have already said, there was nothing remarkable to be detected, at first sight, in any of the valleys and dells that lay among the precipitous heights of the mountains.Nothing at all; unless, indeed, it were three spires of black smoke, which issued from what seemed to be the mouth of a cavern, and clambered sullenly into the atmosphere.Before reaching the mountain-top, these three black smoke-wreaths mingled themselves into one.The cavern was almost directly beneath the winged horse and his rider, at the distance of about a thousand feet.The smoke, as it crept heavily upward, had an ugly, sulphurous, stifling scent, which caused Pegasus to snort and Bellerophon to sneeze.So disagreeable was it to the marvelous steed (who was accustomed to breathe only the purest air), that he waved his wings, and shot half a mile out of the range of this offensive vapor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但当柏勒洛丰回头望的时候，看到了一个东西，他赶紧拽住马勒，让珀加索斯转了过来。他示意了一下，双翼飞马会意，慢慢地从空中降落了下来，直到马蹄离布满岩石的谷底不到一人高。前面就是只要扔一块石头就可以打到的洞穴口，那里一直冒出三股盘旋上升的浓烟。柏勒洛丰还看到了什么呢？</td>
		<td class="en">But, on looking behind him, Bellerophon saw something that induced him first to draw the bridle, and then to turn Pegasus about.He made a sign, which the winged horse understood, and sunk slowly through the air, until his hoofs were scarcely more than a man’s height above the rocky bottom of the valley.In front, as far off as you could throw a stone, was the cavern’s mouth, with the three smoke-wreaths oozing out of it.And what else did Bellerophon behold there?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There seemed to be a heap of strange and terrible creatures curled up within the cavern.Their bodies lay so close together, that Bellerophon could not distinguish them apart; but, judging by their heads, one of these creatures was a huge snake, the second a fierce lion, and the third an ugly goat.The lion and the goat were asleep; the snake was broad awake, and kept staring around him with a great pair of fiery eyes.But—and this was the most wonderful part of the matter—the three spires of smoke evidently issued from the nostrils of these three heads!So strange was the spectacle, that, though Bellerophon had been all along expecting it, the truth did not immediately occur to him, that here was the terrible three-headed Chimera.He had found out the Chimera’s cavern.The snake, the lion, and the goat, as he supposed them to be, were not three separate creatures, but one monster!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">All at once, Bellerophon started as from a dream, and knew it to be the Chimera.Pegasus seemed to know it, at the same instant, and sent forth a neigh, that sounded like the call of a trumpet to battle.At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of flame.Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight towards him, with its immense claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind.If Pegasus had not been as nimble as a bird, both he and his rider would have been overthrown by the Chimera’s headlong rush, and thus the battle have been ended before it was well begun.But the winged horse was not to be caught so.In the twinkling of an eye he was up aloft, halfway to the clouds, snorting with anger.He shuddered, too, not with affright, but with utter disgust at the loathsomeness of this poisonous thing with three heads.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Uttering these words, he shook the bridle; and Pegasus darted down aslant, as swift as the flight of an arrow, right towards the Chimera’s three-fold head, which, all this time, was poking itself as high as it could into the air.As he came within arm’s-length, Bellerophon made a cut at the monster, but was carried onward by his steed, before he could see whether the blow had been successful.Pegasus continued his course, but soon wheeled round, at about the same distance from the Chimera as before.Bellerophon then perceived that he had cut the goat’s head of the monster almost off, so that it dangled downward by the skin, and seemed quite dead.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And again he shook the bridle.Dashing aslantwise, as before, the winged horse made another arrow-flight towards the Chimera, and Bellerophon aimed another downright stroke at one of the two remaining heads, as he shot by.But this time, neither he nor Pegasus escaped so well as at first.With one of its claws, the Chimera had given the young man a deep scratch in his shoulder, and had slightly damaged the left wing of the flying steed with the other.On his part, Bellerophon had mortally wounded the lion’s head of the monster, insomuch that it now hung downward, with its fire almost extinguished, and sending out gasps of thick black smoke.The snake’s head, however (which was the only one now left), was twice as fierce and venomous as ever before.It belched forth shoots of fire five hundred yards long, and emitted hisses so loud, so harsh, and so ear-piercing, that King Iobates heard them, fifty miles off, and trembled till the throne shook under him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When the airy rush of the winged horse had brought him within the distance of a hundred yards, the Chimera gave a spring, and flung its huge, awkward, venomous, and utterly detestable carcass right upon poor Pegasus, clung round him with might and main, and tied up its snaky tail into a knot!Up flew the aerial steed, higher, higher, higher, above the mountain-peaks, above the clouds, and almost out of sight of the solid earth.But still the earth-born monster kept its hold, and was borne upward, along with the creature of light and air.Bellerophon, meanwhile, turning about, found himself face to face with the ugly grimness of the Chimera’s visage, and could only avoid being scorched to death, or bitten right in twain, by holding up his shield.Over the upper edge of the shield, he looked sternly into the savage eyes of the monster.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For the little boy had spent day after day, on the margin of Pirene, waiting for his friend to come back; but when he perceived Bellerophon descending through the clouds, mounted on the winged horse, he had shrunk back into the shrubbery.He was a delicate and tender child, and dreaded lest the old man and the country fellow should see the tears gushing from his eyes.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Yes, dear child!” replied Bellerophon, alighting from the winged horse.“But if thy faith had not helped me, I should never have waited for Pegasus, and never have gone up above the clouds, and never have conquered the terrible Chimera.Thou, my beloved little friend, hast done it all.And now let us give Pegasus his liberty.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Well, Mr. Bright,” answered Primrose, wiping her eyes, and giving him another of her mischievous smiles, “it certainly does elevate your ideas, to get your head above the clouds.I advise you never to tell another story, unless it be, as at present, from the top of a mountain.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“It was so like one of your madcap pranks!” cried Primrose, clapping her hands.“I think I see you now on his back, two miles high, and with your head downward!It is well that you have not really an opportunity of trying your horsemanship on any wilder steed than our sober Davy, or Old Hundred.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对我来说，我倒希望珀加索斯此时此刻就在这儿，”大学生说道，“我一定立刻就骑上去，在附近方圆几英里的地方，策马奔腾，对我的作家兄弟做文学访问。我可以去拜访住在塔科尼克山脚下的杜威博士。在远处的斯托克布里奇，住着詹姆斯先生，他写过的历史和传奇小说有山那么高，令他闻名于世。我想朗费罗现在没住在牛脖套，否则飞马见到他也会嘶鸣的。但在莱诺克斯，我应该可以找到我们最真实的小说家，因为她的素材都取自伯克郡的景物和生活。在皮茨菲尔德这边，坐着赫尔曼·梅尔维尔，他正在构思他的伟大著作《白鲸》，书房的窗户外面隐约可以看到巍峨的格雷洛克山。我的飞马再一蹦，就把我带到了霍姆斯的家门口。我最后才提他，是因为珀加索斯一定会把我掀翻在地，立刻就认这个诗人是它的主人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“For my part, I wish I had Pegasus here, at this moment,” said the student.“I would mount him forthwith, and gallop about the country, within a circumference of a few miles, making literary calls on my brother-authors.Dr. Dewey would be within my reach, at the foot of Taconic.In Stockbridge, yonder, is Mr. James, conspicuous to all the world on his mountain-pile of history and romance.Longfellow, I believe, is not yet at the Ox-bow, else the winged horse would neigh at the sight of him.But, here in Lenox, I should find our most truthful novelist, who has made the scenery and life of Berkshire all her own.On the hither side of Pittsfield sits Herman Melville, shaping out the gigantic conception of his ‘White Whale,’ while the gigantic shape of Graylock looms upon him from his study-window.Another bound of my flying steed would bring me to the door of Holmes, whom I mention last, because Pegasus would certainly unseat me, the next minute, and claim the poet as his rider.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们邻居不也是个作家吗？”报春花问道，“那个少言寡语的人，住在坦格尔伍德大街附近的一幢古老的红房子里，我们有时候能在树林里或湖边遇到他，还有两个孩子跟着他。我听说他写过一首诗，或是传奇小说，或是算术，要么是学校历史书，要么就是别的什么书。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Have we not an author for our next neighbor?” asked Primrose.“That silent man, who lives in the old red house, near Tanglewood Avenue, and whom we sometimes meet, with two children at his side, in the woods or at the lake.I think I have heard of his having written a poem, or a romance, or an arithmetic, or a school-history, or some other kind of a book.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘘，报春花，嘘！”尤斯塔斯把手指挡在嘴唇前，十分激动地悄声说，“千万别谈论那个人，在山顶上也不行！如果我们的闲言碎语传到他的耳朵里，碰巧他又不喜欢这样的话，他只要往火炉里扔一两张纸，那么你报春花、我，还有长春花、香蕨木、南瓜花、蓝眼睛、越橘、红花草、黄花九轮草、车前草、木克草、马利筋、蒲公英和毛莨——对，还有对我的神话评价不高的聪明的普林格尔先生和他可怜的太太——都会化成烟雾，忽地从烟囱里飞出去了！据我所知，住在红房子里的邻居对世界上其他人来说，毫不危险。但是，有东西悄悄地告诉我，他有可怕的力量，能控制我们，可以把我们都毁灭。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hush, Primrose, hush!” exclaimed Eustace, in a thrilling whisper, and putting his finger on his lip.“Not a word about that man, even on a hill-top!If our babble were to reach his ears, and happen not to please him, he has but to fling a quire or two of paper into the stove, and you, Primrose, and I, and Periwinkle, Sweet Fern, Squash-Blossom, Blue Eye, Huckleberry, Clover, Cowslip, Plantain, Milkweed, Dandelion, and Buttercup,—yes, and wise Mr. Pringle, with his unfavorable criticisms on my legends, and poor Mrs. Pringle, too,—would all turn to smoke, and go whisking up the funnel!Our neighbor in the red house is a harmless sort of person enough, for aught I know, as concerns the rest of the world; but something whispers to me that he has a terrible power over ourselves, extending to nothing short of annihilation.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那坦格尔伍德会不会也像我们一样化成灰？”长春花对于这个可能降临的灾难感到非常害怕，问道，“本和布鲁因会怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And would Tanglewood turn to smoke, as well as we?” asked Periwinkle, quite appalled at the threatened destruction.“And what would become of Ben and Bruin?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“坦格尔伍德没事儿，”大学生回答道，“会和现在一模一样，只不过，会住着另外一些人。本和布鲁因还会活着，吃着餐桌上剩下的骨头，过得很舒服，从来也不会想起它们和我们在一起度过的美好时光！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tanglewood would remain,” replied the student, “looking just as it does now, but occupied by an entirely different family.And Ben and Bruin would be still alive, and would make themselves very comfortable with the bones from the dinner-table, without ever thinking of the good times which they and we have had together!”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说笑着，这伙人已经开始下山了，钻进了树林的阴凉里。报春花采了一些山月桂，那些叶子还是去年长的，但仍然翠绿而新鲜，似乎冰雪和解冻都没有对它们造成伤害。她用月桂编了一个花环，摘掉那个学生的帽子，把花环戴在了他头上。</td>
		<td class="en">With idle chat of this kind, the party had already begun to descend the hill, and were now within the shadow of the woods.Primrose gathered some mountain-laurel, the leaf of which, though of last year’s growth, was still as verdant and elastic as if the frost and thaw had not alternately tried their force upon its texture.Of these twigs of laurel she twined a wreath, and took off the student’s cap, in order to place it on his brow.</td></tr>

T. 菲尔茨先生（去年夏天在伯克郡，我认识了他，他是个诗人，也是个出版商）一眼就会看出我的作品有不同寻常之处。他会找人给故事配插图，我希望是比林斯来画，他还会找到最厉害的赞助，通过有名的蒂克纳出版公司把它们推向全世界。从现在起，大概五个月内，我无疑会成为一名当代了不起的作家！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do not be too sure,” answered Eustace, looking really like a youthful poet, with the laurel among his glossy curls, “that I shall not win other wreaths by these wonderful and admirable stories.I mean to spend all my leisure, during the rest of the vacation, and throughout the summer term at college, in writing them out for the press.Mr. J.T. Fields (with whom I became acquainted when he was in Berkshire, last summer, and who is a poet, as well as a publisher) will see their uncommon merit at a glance.He will get them illustrated, I hope, by Billings, and will bring them before the world under the very best of auspices, through the eminent house of TICKNOR & CO.In about five months from this moment, I make no doubt of being reckoned among the lights of the age!”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Descending a little lower, Bruin began to bark, and was answered by the graver bow-wow of the respectable Ben.They soon saw the good old dog, keeping careful watch over Dandelion, Sweet Fern, Cowslip, and Squash-Blossom.These little people, quite recovered from their fatigue, had set about gathering checkerberries, and now came clambering to meet their playfellows.Thus reunited, the whole party went down through Luther Butler’s orchard, and made the best of their way home to Tanglewood.</td></tr>
