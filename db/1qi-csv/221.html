		<td class="en">by Washington Irving</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我出生在阿布鲁齐边上的弗罗西诺内小镇。我父亲靠做买卖积累了点儿财产，让我接受教育，因为他想让我成为一名牧师。但我只爱结交朋友，对修道服不感兴趣，所以长大后我就成了一个四处闲荡的人。我是个粗心的人，有时爱和别人争论，但大体上说，脾气还是好的，所以有段时间我过得很愉快，直到我坠入了情网。在我们的小镇上住着公爵的土地测量员，或者说是土地监管员。他有一个年轻的女儿，一个十六岁的漂亮女孩。大家都认为她比我们镇上的一般人都要优秀，并且几乎总是呆在家里。我偶尔能见到她，就疯狂地爱上了她；她看起来是那么清新、温柔，与那些我见惯了的皮肤晒得黝黑的姑娘完全不一样。</td>
		<td class="en">I was born at the little town of Frosinone, which lies at the skirts of the Abruzzi.My father had made a little property in trade, and gave me some education, as he intended me for the church, but I had kept gay company too much to relish the cowl, so I grew up a loiterer about the place.I was a heedless fellow, a little quarrelsome on occasions, but good-humored in the main, so I made my way very well for a time, until I fell in love.There lived in our town a surveyor, or land bailiff, of the prince’s who had a young daughter, a beautiful girl of sixteen.She was looked upon as something better than the common run of our townsfolk, and kept almost entirely at home.I saw her occasionally, and became madly in love with her, she looked so fresh and tender, and so different to the sunburnt females to whom I had been accustomed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于父亲总给我钱花，我就经常盛装打扮，抓住一切机会在这个小美人面前炫耀一番。我过去经常能在教堂里看到她；我略会弹吉他，所以有时，一到傍晚我就在她窗下为她弹奏一曲；我还设法在她父亲的葡萄园里和她见面。那个葡萄园离小镇不远，她有时去那里散步。她显然也喜欢我，可她年纪尚小，又害羞，况且她父亲对她看管严格，并对我的殷勤十分警惕，因为他对我的印象不好，想为他的女儿找个更好的对象。我早已习惯了轻易赢得女人的心，还是当地公认的最聪明的小伙子之一，对于现在遇到的困难，不禁很生气。</td>
		<td class="en">As my father kept me in money, I always dressed well, and took all opportunities of showing myself to advantage in the eyes of the little beauty.I used to see her at church; and as I could play a little upon the guitar, I gave her a tune sometimes under her window of an evening; and I tried to have interviews with her in her father’s vineyard, not far from the town, where she sometimes walked.She was evidently pleased with me, but she was young and shy, and her Father kept a strict eye upon her, and took alarm at my attentions, for he had a bad opinion of me, and looked for a better match for his daughter.I became furious at the difficulties thrown in my way, having been accustomed always to easy success among the women, being considered one of the smartest young fellows of the place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她父亲给她带来了一个求婚者，是邻镇的一个富有的农场主。结婚的日子定下来了，准备工作也在进行当中。我从她的窗口看见了她，并且感觉她也悲伤地看着我。我下定决心，不管付出什么代价，都不能让这场婚礼举行。我在集市上遇到了她的未婚夫，就再也压抑不住心中的怒火了。我们争吵了几句后，我拔出匕首，刺进了他的心脏。我逃到附近的一个教堂里避难，花了点钱，得到了赦免，但是我不敢冒险离开这个避难所。</td>
		<td class="en">Her father brought home a suitor for her; a rich farmer from a neighboring town.The wedding-day was appointed, and preparations were making.I got sight of her at her window, and I thought she looked sadly at me.I determined the match should not take place, cost what it might.I met her intended bridegroom in the market-place, and could not restrain the expression of my rage.A few hot words passed between us, when I drew my stiletto, and stabbed him to the heart.I fled to a neighboring church for refuge; and with a little money I obtained absolution; but I did not dare to venture from my asylum.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那时，我们的队长正在组建队伍。他从小就认识我，听到我的情况后，就秘密地找到我。在他的提议下，我同意加入他的队伍。我早就知道山里有几个勇敢的家伙，他们经常到镇上的这群年轻人当中大把大把地花钱，而我的确也不止一次想去过这种生活了。于是，一天深夜我离开了我的避难所，赶到事先约好的会面地点，并按规定发了誓，于是我就成了这支队伍中的一员了。有段时间我们呆在偏远的山区里。在那里，有点儿狂热的冒险生活和我的想象发生了奇妙的碰撞，转移了我的心思。最终我的心思又猛烈地转了回来，我又想起了萝塞塔。我感到孤独的时候，会经常怀想起她的模样。夜里我在山里为扎营熟睡的人放哨时，我的感情几乎到了狂热的地步。</td>
		<td class="en">At that time our captain was forming his troop.He had known me from boyhood, and hearing of my situation, came to me in secret, and made such offers that I agreed to enlist myself among his followers.Indeed, I had more than once thought of taking to this mode of life, having known several brave fellows of the mountains, who used to spend their money freely among us youngsters of the town.I accordingly left my asylum late one night, repaired to the appointed place of meeting; took the oaths prescribed, and became one of the troop.We were for some time in a distant part of the mountains, and our wild adventurous kind of life hit my fancy wonderfully, and diverted my thoughts.At length they returned with all their violence to the recollection of Rosetta.The solitude in which I often found myself gave me time to brood over her image, and as I have kept watch at night over our sleeping camp in the mountains, my feelings have been roused almost to a fever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终我们转移了驻地，决定沿着泰拉奇纳和那不勒斯中间的那条路下去。在行进过程中，我们要用一两天的时间穿过高耸在弗罗西诺内之上的树木繁多的山林。我无法告诉你们，当我向下面张望并且辨认出萝塞塔的住所时，心里是什么感受。我决定见她一面，但是为了什么呢？我不能指望她会放弃她的家庭，到山里陪我一起过这种冒险的生活。她是在温柔的呵护中长大的，受不了这种生活。当我看到那些和我们队伍中的人交往的女人时，我不敢想象她跟她们做伴时的情景。所有一切都回到我以前生活的样子也是绝不可能的，因为我还是悬赏通缉的犯人。但我还是决定见她一面，这件事的危险和徒劳，反而更让我疯狂地想去完成它。</td>
		<td class="en">At length we shifted our ground, and determined to make a descent upon the road between Terracina and Naples.In the course of our expedition, we passed a day or two in the woody mountains which rise above Frosinone.I cannot tell you how I felt when I looked down upon the place, and distinguished the residence of Rosetta.I determined to have an interview with her; but to what purpose?I could not expect that she would quit her home, and accompany me in my hazardous life among the mountains.She had been brought up too tenderly for that; and when I looked upon the women who were associated with some of our troop, I could not have borne the thoughts of her being their companion.All return to my former life was likewise hopeless; for a price was set upon my head.Still I determined to see her; the very hazard and fruitlessness of the thing made me furious to accomplish it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >自从我说服我们队长到弗罗西诺内附近转转，希望在那诱捕到几个重要人物，强迫他们交纳赎金，到现在已经过了将近三星期了。傍晚时候，我们在离萝塞塔父亲的葡萄园不远的地方设了埋伏。我偷偷地从伙伴中溜了出去，走近去侦察她经常散步的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">It is about three weeks since I persuaded our captain to draw down to the vicinity of Frosinone, in hopes of entrapping some of its principal inhabitants, and compelling them to a ransom.We were lying in ambush towards evening, not far from the vineyard of Rosetta’s father.I stole quietly from my companions, and drew near to reconnoitre the place of her frequent walks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在葡萄藤中，当我看到一件白裙子隐隐闪现时，我的心跳得多快啊！我知道那肯定是萝塞塔，因为在当地穿白衣服的女人很少。我悄悄地、没有一点儿声响地走了上去，拨开葡萄藤，突然站在了她面前。她发出了一声刺耳的尖叫，而我一把将她拉进怀里，捂住了她的嘴，让她别出声。我的感情全部涌了出来，主动向她说要放弃自己的生活方式，把我的命运交到她手上，和她一起逃到我们可以安全地呆在一起的地方。所有我说的和我做的，都没让她镇静下来。看起来占据她内心的是恐惧和惊吓，而不是爱。她挣扎着快要脱开了我的手臂，空气中充满了她的喊叫声。转眼间，队长和其他伙伴们把我们包围住了。那个时候我愿意付出一切让她安全脱离我们的手掌，回到她父亲的房子里去。一切都太晚了。队长宣布她是战利品，还命令我们把她带回山里去。我提出异议，说她是我的战利品，我对她有优先权；我还提到了我之前的恋情。他以尖刻的冷笑回应了我，说强盗和村里的人没有任何瓜葛，按照队伍的规矩，所有这一类的战利品都要投票表决。爱和嫉妒燃起了我心中的愤怒，但我必须在顺从和死亡中间做出选择。我把她交给了队长，随后我们向山里进发了。</td>
		<td class="en">How my heart beat when, among the vines, I beheld the gleaming of a white dress!I knew it must be Rosetta’s; it being rare for any female of the place to dress in white.I advanced secretly and without noise, until putting aside the vines, I stood suddenly before her.She uttered a piercing shriek, but I seized her in my arms, put my hand upon her mouth and conjured her to be silent.I poured out all the frenzy of my passion; offered to renounce my mode of life, to put my fate in her hands, to fly with her where we might live in safety together.All that I could say, or do, would not pacify her.Instead of love, horror and affright seemed to have taken possession of her breast.She struggled partly from my grasp, and filled the air with her cries.In an instant the captain and the rest of my companions were around us.I would have given anything at that moment had she been safe out of our hands, and in her father’s house.It was too late.The captain pronounced her a prize, and ordered that she should be borne to the mountains.I represented to him that she was my prize, that I had a previous claim to her; and I mentioned my former attachment.He sneered bitterly in reply; observed that brigands had no business with village intrigues, and that, according to the laws of the troop, all spoils of the kind were determined by lot.Love and jealousy were raging in my heart, but I had to choose between obedience and death.I surrendered her to the captain, and we made for the mountains.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她简直吓坏了，脚步踉踉跄跄的，要扶住她才行。一想到我的那些同伴会去碰她，我就受不了，但我还要强迫自己装出心平气和的样子，请求他们把她交给我，因为她对我更习惯一些。队长用锐利的目光看了我一会儿，可是我没有畏缩，他同意了。我把她搂进怀里，她几乎快晕了过去。她的头靠在我的肩膀上，嘴唇快挨着我的了。我的脸能感觉到她的呼吸，似乎正向要吞噬我的火焰煽着风。噢，上帝！抱着这么一个闪闪发光的宝贝，却想着它不是我的！</td>
		<td class="en">She was overcome by affright, and her steps were so feeble and faltering, and it was necessary to support her.I could not endure the idea that my comrades should touch her, and assuming a forced tranquillity, begged that she might be confided to me, as one to whom she was more accustomed.The captain regarded me for a moment with a searching look, but I bore it without flinching, and he consented, I took her in my arms: she was almost senseless.Her head rested on my shoulder, her mouth was near to mine.I felt her breath on my face, and it seemed to fan the flame which devoured me.Oh, God! To have this glowing treasure in my arms, and yet to think it was not mine!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们来到了山脚下。我很吃力地往上爬，尤其是在树林浓密的地方；但是我不会放弃我美妙的负担。但是，我想到我马上就必须那样做，心里怒火冲天。一想到这么一个精美的宝贝要落入我那些粗鲁的同伴手中，我就快发疯了。我很想手握匕首，从他们中间杀出一条路，成功地把她夺回来。刚想到这个主意，我就知道这样太轻率了；但是一想到除了我其他人竟然也要享受她的魅力，我的头脑就发热。我加快脚步，努力超过我的同伴，这样能走到前头，超过他们一段距离，说不定能争取到一个逃跑的好机会。全是些徒劳无功的努力！队长突然命令停下来。我颤抖起来，但是必须服从命令。这个可怜的女孩半睁着倦怠的眼睛，但是没有力气，也没有动。我把她放在草地上。队长用怀疑的眼光恶狠狠地瞪了我一眼，命令我和伙伴们去树林里巡逻一下，找个可以给她父亲送信的牧羊人，以便索要赎金。</td>
		<td class="en">We arrived at the foot of the mountain.I ascended it with difficulty, particularly where the woods were thick; but I would not relinquish my delicious burthen.I reflected with rage, however, that I must soon do so.The thoughts that so delicate a creature must be abandoned to my rude companions, maddened me.I felt tempted, the stiletto in my hand, to cut my way through them all, and bear her off in triumph.I scarcely conceived the idea, before I saw its rashness; but my brain was fevered with the thought that any but myself should enjoy her charms.I endeavored to outstrip my companions by the quickness of my movements; and to get a little distance ahead, in case any favorable opportunity of escape should present.Vain effort!The voice of the captain suddenly ordered a halt.I trembled, but had to obey.The poor girl partly opened a languid eye, but was without strength or motion.I laid her upon the grass.The captain darted on me a terrible look of suspicion, and ordered me to scour the woods with my companions, in search of some shepherd who might be sent to her father’s to demand a ransom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我马上看出了有危险。如果用暴力来反抗，必死无疑；但是怎能把她单独留下，任由队长摆布！——在激情和绝望的驱动下，我激动地喊了出来。我提醒队长说，我是第一个抓住她的，她应该是我的战利品，还有我先前对她的感情应该让她免于侵犯。因此，我坚持说，他应该对我守信，要尊重她，否则，我再不会服从他的命令了。他唯一的回答，就是扳动了他的卡宾枪，而一看到这个信号，我的同伴们也全都扳上了枪。他们残忍地嘲笑我软弱无力的愤怒。我还能做些什么呢？我知道抵抗是件愚蠢的事。我四面受敌，我的那些伙伴们强迫我跟着他们一起走。她孤零零地留了下来，与强盗头子呆在一起——是的，她一个人，而且还几乎奄奄一息了。</td>
		<td class="en">I saw at once the peril.To resist with violence was certain death; but to leave her alone, in the power of the captain! —I spoke out then with a fervor inspired by my passion and my despair.I reminded the captain that I was the first to seize her; that she was my prize, and that my previous attachment for her should make her sacred among my companions.I insisted, therefore, that he should pledge me his word to respect her; otherwise I should refuse obedience to his orders.His only reply was, to cock his carbine; and at the signal my comrades did the same.They laughed with cruelty at my impotent rage.What could I do?I felt the madness of resistance.I was menaced on all hands, and my companions obliged me to follow them.She remained alone with the chief—yes, alone and almost lifeless!—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >讲到这儿，这个强盗情绪非常激动，以至于说不下去了。他额头上冒着大汗，他是在喘息，而不是呼吸；他强壮的胸肌像翻腾的海浪似的一起一伏。当他稍稍平静的时候，他又接着讲他的故事。</td>
		<td class="en">Here the robber paused in his recital, overpowered by his emotions.Great drops of sweat stood on his forehead; he panted rather than breathed; his brawny bosom rose and fell like the waves of a troubled sea.When he had become a little calm, he continued his recital.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他说，我没用多久就找到了一个牧羊人。我像只鹿一样飞奔着。如果有可能的话，我急于在我所担心的事情发生之前赶回去。我已经把同伴们远远地甩在了后面，而且在他们还没有走到我所走过的一半路之前，我又回到了他们中间。我催他们赶快回去，回到队长那儿去。当我们走近时，我看到他正坐在萝塞塔的旁边。他那副得意的表情和这个不幸女孩的悲凉境地，让我一下明白了她的命运。我不知道该如何抑制我的愤怒。</td>
		<td class="en">I was not long in finding a shepherd, said he.I ran with the rapidity of a deer, eager, if possible, to get back before what I dreaded might take place.I had left my companions far behind, and I rejoined them before they had reached one-half the distance I had made.I hurried them back to the place where we had left the captain.As we approached, I beheld him seated by the side of Rosetta.His triumphant look, and the desolate condition of the unfortunate girl, left me no doubt of her fate.I know not how I restrained my fury.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >强盗头子抓着她的手，很费劲地让她写了几个字，要求她父亲送三百元赎金过来。写好的信由找来的牧羊人送了出去。牧羊人走了以后，强盗头子严厉地转向我。“你真是个叛变、任性的典型，”他说，“如果任你胡来，就会毁掉队伍。如果按照我们的规矩处置你的话，这颗子弹早已经穿过你的脑袋了。但你是我的老朋友，所以我对你的狂暴和愚蠢有耐心；我甚至还保护了你，没有让你因为愚蠢的激情而丧失男人气概。至于这个姑娘，必须按照我们队伍的规矩来处置。”说着，他就下了命令，抽了签，这个无助的姑娘就这样落入了强盗们手中。</td>
		<td class="en">It was with extreme difficulty, and by guiding her hand, that she was made to trace a few characters, requesting her father to send three hundred dollars as her ransom.The letter was despatched by the shepherd.When he was gone, the chief turned sternly to me: “You have set an example,” said he, “of mutiny and self-will, which if indulged would be ruinous to the troop.Had I treated you as our laws require, this bullet would have been driven through your brain.But you are an old friend; I have borne patiently with your fury and your folly; I have even protected you from a foolish passion that would have unmanned you.As to this girl, the laws of our association must have their course.”So saying, he gave his commands, lots were drawn, and the helpless girl was abandoned to the troop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说到这儿，这个强盗又停了下来，愤怒地喘着气，过了一会儿，他又开始讲他的故事。</td>
		<td class="en">Here the robber paused again, panting with fury and it was some moments before he could resume his story.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他说，该死的，气死我了。我看到没有机会为自己报仇了，而按照我们约束所有人的规矩，我感觉队长是对的。我发狂似地往前冲。我一下扑倒在地上，痛苦又愤怒地用手撕扯着青草，捶着自己的头，咬牙切齿。当我最终转身回去时，我看到了那个可怜的受害者，她的脸色苍白，头发蓬乱，衣服也被撕得凌乱不堪。瞬间一股怜悯的感情压制了我更猛烈的感情。我把她背到一棵树下，轻轻地让她靠着树。我拿着装满酒的葫芦放在她的嘴边，尽力让她喝上一点。她落到了一个什么样的地步啊！我曾经把她看做弗罗西诺内的骄傲，就在不久前我还看到她在她父亲的葡萄园里玩耍，那么鲜艳，美丽和幸福！现在她紧咬牙关，眼睛盯着地面，身体一动不动，完全处于麻木的状态。我看着她，痛苦地回想起她以前的样子，以及我现在看到的她痛苦的样子。我惊恐地朝伙伴们看了一眼，他们看起来像那么多的魔鬼，正在为一个天使的毁灭而兴高采烈，我为是他们的同伙而感到厌恶。</td>
		<td class="en">Hell, said he, was raging in my heart.I beheld the impossibility of avenging myself, and I felt that, according to the articles in which we stood bound to one another, the captain was in the right.I rushed with frenzy from the place.I threw myself upon the earth; tore up the grass with my hands, and beat my head, and gnashed my teeth in agony and rage.When at length I returned, I beheld the wretched victim, pale, dishevelled; her dress torn and disordered.An emotion of pity for a moment subdued my fiercer feelings.I bore her to the foot of a tree, and leaned her gently against it.I took my gourd, which was filled with wine, and applying it to her lips, endeavored to make her swallow a little.To what a condition was she recovered!She, whom I had once seen the pride of Frosinone, who but a short time before I had beheld sporting in her father’s vineyard, so fresh and beautiful and happy!Her teeth were clenched; her eyes fixed on the ground; her form without motion, and in a state of absolute insensibility.I hung over her in an agony of recollection of all that she had been, and of anguish at what I now beheld her.I darted round a look of horror at my companions, who seemed like so many fiends exulting in the downfall of an angel, and I felt a horror at myself for being their accomplice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >队长总是很多疑，以他惯有的洞察力看穿了我的心思；他命令我爬到树上去，向周围的地方查看一下，等那个牧羊人回来。当然我压住了心中的怒火，听从了他的命令，虽然我知道他现在是我最大的死敌。</td>
		<td class="en">The captain, always suspicious, saw with his usual penetration what was passing within me, and ordered me to go upon the ridge of woods to keep a look-out upon the neighborhood and await the return of the shepherd.I obeyed, of course, stifling the fury that raged within me, though I felt for the moment that he was my most deadly foe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管如此，在去的路上，我心中闪过了一个念头。我察觉到队长只是在严格执行那些我们发誓要忠诚的可怕规矩罢了。若不是他的容忍，若要秉公处理的话，我那冲动的激情早把我害死了。他看透了我的想法，采取预防措施，把我支开了，以防我在盛怒之下干出什么过分的事。这么一想我感觉我还是可以原谅他的。</td>
		<td class="en">On my way, however, a ray of reflection came across my mind.I perceived that the captain was but following with strictness the terrible laws to which we had sworn fidelity.That the passion by which I had been blinded might with justice have been fatal to me but for his forbearance; that he had penetrated my soul, and had taken precautions, by sending me out of the way, to prevent my committing any excess in my anger.From that instant I felt that I was capable of pardoning him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >怀着这种想法，我来到了山脚下。这个村庄偏远安静，不一会儿我远远地看到了那个牧羊人正在穿过平原。我急忙跑过去见他。他什么也没有带回来。他看到她父亲沉浸在巨大的悲伤中。他激动地看了信，突然努力使自己平静下来，冷冷地说：“我的女儿已经被那些恶棍糟蹋了，不给赎金放她回来吧，要不就让她死了吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">Occupied with these thoughts, I arrived at the foot of the mountain.The country was solitary and secure; and in a short time I beheld the shepherd at a distance crossing the plain.I hastened to meet him.He had obtained nothing.He had found the father plunged in the deepest distress.He had read the letter with violent emotion, and then calming himself with a sudden exertion, he had replied coldly, “My daughter has been dishonored by those wretches; let her be returned without ransom, or let her die!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到这种回答，我浑身战栗起来。按照我们队伍的规矩，我知道她必死无疑。我们的誓约就是这么要求的。但是，我认为既然我不能拥有她，那我就成为她的侩子手吧！</td>
		<td class="en">I shuddered at this reply.I knew, according to the laws of our troop, her death was inevitable.Our oaths required it.I felt, nevertheless, that, not having been able to have her to myself, I could become her executioner!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个强盗又停了下来，情绪激动。我坐下来思索他最后那几句可怕的话，它证明了激情一旦挣脱道德的约束，任何事情都有可能发生。这个故事里有一个可怕的真理，它让我想起了但丁创作的某些悲剧故事。</td>
		<td class="en">The robber again paused with agitation.I sat musing upon his last frightful words, which proved to what excess the passions may be carried when escaped from all moral restraint.There was a horrible verity in this story that reminded me of some of the tragic fictions of Danté.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在我们来到了生死关头，那个强盗继续说。听牧羊人说完后，我和他一起回去了。强盗头子也从牧羊人那里得知她的父亲拒绝交付赎金。他打了一个我们都明白的手势，然后我们跟着他走到距离受害者稍远的地方。他在那里宣布要处死她。大家都站在那儿，准备执行他的命令，但是我阻止了。我说世上有些事情需要正义，同时也需要怜悯。我和你们一样都赞成这条不能改变的规矩，来警告所有犹豫不决、不愿为我们的俘虏交付赎金的那些人，但是即使处死这姑娘是对的，也不应该做得那么残忍。天色已经晚了，我接着说，她马上就要睡觉了，那时再处死她吧。由于我以前对她的喜爱，现在我只要求让我来给她一刀。我肯定会做到的，但是比其他人做得要温柔些。</td>
		<td class="en">We now came to a fatal moment, resumed the bandit.After the report of the shepherd, I returned with him, and the chieftain received from his lips the refusal of the father.At a signal, which we all understood, we followed him some distance from the victim.He there pronounced her sentence of death.Every one stood ready to execute his order; but I interfered.I observed that there was something due to pity, as well as to justice.That I was as ready as any one to approve the implacable law which was to serve as a warning to all those who hesitated to pay the ransoms demanded for our prisoners, but that, though the sacrifice was proper, it ought to be made without cruelty.The night is approaching, continued I; she will soon be wrapped in sleep; let her then be despatched.All that I now claim on the score of former fondness for her is, let me strike the blow.I will do it as surely, but more tenderly than another.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有几个人大声反对我的建议，但是强盗头子要求他们安静下来。他告诉我，我可以把她带到远处的树林里去，因为他相信我的承诺。</td>
		<td class="en">Several raised their voices against my proposition, but the captain imposed silence on them.He told me I might conduct her into a thicket at some distance, and he relied upon my promise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我急忙去抓我的猎物。我终于成为她唯一的拥有者了，这是一种凄凉的胜利。我把她带到树林的深处。她仍然处在没有知觉的昏迷状态。我要感谢她没有想起我，如果她轻轻地叫出我的名字，我会受不了的。她最终睡在了要刺死她的那个人的怀里。在我刺她一刀之前，内心经受了重重矛盾。在最近经历了一连串的斗争后，我的心早已伤痕累累。我害怕由于拖延时间，别人就成了她的刽子手。她安静了一会儿后，我轻轻地离开了她，因为我不想中断她的睡眠。然后我突然拿起匕首，刺进了她的胸膛。只听到痛苦、强烈的呻吟声，但是没有任何抽搐的动作，她就咽了最后一口气。这个不幸的人就这样死去了。</td>
		<td class="en">I hastened to seize my prey.There was a forlorn kind of triumph at having at length become her exclusive possessor.I bore her off into the thickness of the forest.She remained in the same state of insensibility and stupor.I was thankful that she did not recollect me; for had she once murmured my name, I should have been overcome.She slept at length in the arms of him who was to poniard her.Many were the conflicts I underwent before I could bring myself to strike the blow.My heart had become sore by the recent conflicts it had undergone, and I dreaded lest, by procrastination, some other should become her executioner.When her repose had continued for some time, I separated myself gently from her, that I might not disturb her sleep, and seizing suddenly my poniard, plunged it into her bosom.A painful and concentrated murmur, but without any convulsive movement, accompanied her last sigh.So perished this unfortunate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他停下来，不说了。我惊恐地坐在那儿，用手捂着脸，好像要尽力躲开他展现在我大脑中的恐怖场景一样。队长的声音把我从这片寂静中唤醒过来。“你睡着了，”他说，“我们该走了。过来，我们必须离开这儿，天都快黑了，送信的还没有回来。我会派人到山边去看看，把送信的带到我们过夜的地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">He ceased to speak.I sat horror-struck, covering my face with my hands, seeking, as it were, to hide from myself the frightful images he had presented to my mind.I was roused from this silence by the voice of the captain.“You sleep,” said he, “and it is time to be off.Come, we must abandon this height, as night is setting in, and the messenger is not returned.I will post some one on the mountain edge, to conduct him to the place where we shall pass the night.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于我来说，这不是什么令人愉快的消息。听了那个悲惨的故事，我感到心里很难受。我疲惫又烦乱，又看看这个强盗，我越来越不能忍受。</td>
		<td class="en">This was no agreeable news to me.I was sick at heart with the dismal story I had heard.I was harassed and fatigued, and the sight of the banditti began to grow insupportable to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >队长召集好了队伍。我们迅速地走下早上好不容易爬上来的森林，不一会儿就来到了一条看起来经常有人过往的大路上。强盗们很警觉地往前走，背着他们已经上了膛的枪，用机警又怀疑的眼神四处打量着。他们害怕遇上巡逻队。我们已经把罗卡·帕里奥甩在了后面。附近有口泉水，因为我特别口渴，就请求允许停下来喝口水。队长亲自走了过去，用他的帽子给我端了水回来。我们继续往前走，这时就在横跨大路的小路尽头，我看到了一个身穿白衣的女子坐在马背上。就她一个人。我想到故事里那个可怜女孩的命运，不禁为她的安全打了一颤。</td>
		<td class="en">The captain assembled his comrades.We rapidly descended the forest which we had mounted with so much difficulty in the morning, and soon arrived in what appeared to be a frequented road.The robbers proceeded with great caution, carrying their guns cocked, and looking on every side with wary and suspicious eyes.They were apprehensive of encountering the civic patrole.We left Rocca Priori behind us.There was a fountain near by, and as I was excessively thirsty, I begged permission to stop and drink.The captain himself went, and brought me water in his hat.We pursued our route, when, at the extremity of an alley which crossed the road, I perceived a female on horseback, dressed in white.She was alone.I recollected the fate of the poor girl in the story, and trembled for her safety.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其中有个强盗同时也看到了她，便钻进灌木丛中，朝着那女子猛奔了过去。那个强盗在小路旁边停下来，单腿跪在地上，端起他的卡宾枪，准备威胁她，或者等她试图逃跑时，开枪打她的马，就这样等着她过来。我非常焦虑地看着她。我想大叫一声来警告她有危险，即使我自己因此丧命。眼看着这只老虎卧在那里准备要扑过去，而那个可怜无辜的牺牲品却在附近无意识地转悠着，这种感觉很不好受。只有一个意外的机会才能救她。令我高兴的是，她有获救的机会了。她好像是很偶然地走上了对面的一条小路，通往森林外面，那边是强盗不敢冒险去的地方。正是因为这次偶然的方向偏离，她才获得了安全。</td>
		<td class="en">One of the brigands saw her at the same instant, and plunging into the bushes, he ran precipitately in the direction towards her.Stopping on the border of the alley, he put one knee to the ground, presented his carbine ready for menace, or to shoot her horse if she attempted to fly, and in this way awaited her approach.I kept my eyes fixed on her with intense anxiety.I felt tempted to shout, and warn her of her danger, though my own destruction would have been the consequence.It was awful to see this tiger crouching ready for a bound, and the poor innocent victim wandering unconsciously near him.Nothing but a mere chance could save her.To my joy, the chance turned in her favor.She seemed almost accidentally to take an opposite path, which led outside of the wood, where the robber dare not venture.To this casual deviation she owed her safety.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我想不出队长为什么要冒险走这么长的路，离开他早已布置好暗哨、等待送信者的高地。他自己似乎也对这种暴露自己的危险感到不安。他动作慌张迅速，我几乎很难跟上他的步伐。终于，经过三个小时可以被称作是急行军的跋涉，我们走到了同一片森林的尽头。我们白天占据了它所属的高地。让我感到宽慰的是，我们已经到了过夜的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">I could not imagine why the captain of the band had ventured to such a distance from the height, on which he had placed the sentinel to watch the return of the messengers.He seemed himself uneasy at the risk to which he exposed himself.His movements were rapid and uneasy; I could scarce keep pace with him.At length, after three hours of what might be termed a forced march, we mounted the extremity of the same woods, the summit of which we had occupied during the day; and I learnt with satisfaction, that we had reached our quarters for the night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你肯定累坏了，”强盗头子说，“但我们还是得查看一下周围的环境，这样晚上才能不受惊扰。要是我们遇上了著名的罗卡·帕里奥公民卫兵，那就有好戏看了。”这个强盗头子如此常备不懈、深谋远虑，不断地显现出他的军事才能。</td>
		<td class="en">“You must be fatigued,” said the chieftain; “but it was necessary to survey the environs, so as not to be surprised during the night.Had we met with the famous civic guard of Rocca Priori you would have seen fine sport.”Such was the indefatigable precaution and forethought of this robber chief, who really gave continual evidences of military talent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >夜晚美极了。万里无云的天空中，一轮明月悄然升起，朦胧的月光照亮了巍峨的高山，而那四处闪烁的灯光，宛如广袤昏暗的土地上的繁星，暴露了牧羊人孤寂的小屋。我早已累得精疲力尽，又经历了这么多让人焦虑不安的事情，我准备去睡一觉，想起马上就要获得解脱，便觉十分宽慰。队长命令他的同伴去捡些干苔藓；他亲手用苔藓做了一张床垫和一个枕头，并把他的大披风给我当铺盖。这位慈善的杀人犯如此出乎意料地关心我，让我不禁感到既惊讶又欣喜：因为十恶不赦的罪犯流露出日常生活中才具有的仁慈，实在没有比这更令人吃惊的了。这就像在火山的岩石缝和灰烬中发现山谷中娇嫩的花朵和清新的小草一样。</td>
		<td class="en">The night was magnificent.The moon rising above the horizon in a cloudless sky, faintly lit up the grand features of the mountains, while lights twinkling here and there, like terrestrial stars, in the wide, dusky expanse of the landscape, betrayed the lonely cabins of the shepherds.Exhausted by fatigue, and by the many agitations I had experienced, I prepared to sleep, soothed by the hope of approaching deliverance.The captain ordered his companions to collect some dry moss; he arranged with his own hands a kind of mattress and pillow of it, and gave me his ample mantle as a covering.I could not but feel both surprised and gratified by such unexpected attentions on the part of this benevolent cut-throat: for there is nothing more striking than to find the ordinary charities, which are matters of course in common life, flourishing by the side of such stern and sterile crime.It is like finding the tender flowers and fresh herbage of the valley growing among the rocks and cinders of the volcano.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >入睡前，我与这个队长深谈了一会儿，他似乎非常信任我。他说到我们早上的那番谈话，告诉我他已经厌倦了这种危险的行当。他已有了足够的财富，很想赶紧回到大千世界，跟家人一起过平静安宁的生活。他很想知道我能否为他弄到一张去美国的护照。我称赞了他的良好心愿，并许诺会尽我所能帮助他实现愿望。而后我们便道了晚安。劳累了一天后，我伸手摊脚地躺在苔藓床上，感觉就像睡在毛绒绒的窝里。我盖着那个强盗的防潮披风，一夜熟睡，直到听见信号方才起床。</td>
		<td class="en">Before I fell asleep, I had some farther discourse with the captain, who seemed to put great confidence in me.He referred to our previous conversation of the morning; told me he was weary of his hazardous profession; that he had acquired sufficient property, and was anxious to return to the world and lead a peaceful life in the bosom of his family.He wished to know whether it was not in my power to procure him a passport for the United States of America.I applauded his good intentions, and promised to do everything in my power to promote its success.We then parted for the night.I stretched myself upon my couch of moss, which, after my fatigues, felt like a bed of down, and sheltered by the robber’s mantle from all humidity, I slept soundly without waking, until the signal to arise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >已经快六点了，天刚破晓。由于我们过夜的地方太过暴露，于是便转移到树林深处去了。我们生起了火。当火焰燃起来时，强盗们就铺展开披风将其围住；但是等火焰熄灭、只剩下发红的灰烬时，强盗们就放下披风，围成圆圈坐了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">It was nearly six o’clock, and the day was just dawning.As the place where we had passed the night was too much exposed, we moved up into the thickness of the woods.A fire was kindled.While there was any flame, the mantles were again extended round it; but when nothing remained but glowing cinders, they were lowered, and the robbers seated themselves in a circle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >眼前的场景让我想起了荷马作品中描述的情景。唯一缺少的就是炭上的祭品，以及一把将肥肉切开分给大家的圣刀。我的伙伴们可以与冷酷的希腊勇士相匹敌。而我发现，取代阿基利斯和阿加梅农高贵宴饮的，是草地上还留着的前天晚上大家狼吞虎咽后剩下的火腿、面包残渣、乳酪和酒。</td>
		<td class="en">The scene before me reminded me of some of those described by Homer.There wanted only the victim on the coals, and the sacred knife, to cut off the succulent parts, and distribute them around.My companions might have rivalled the grim warriors of Greece.In place of the noble repasts, however, of Achilles and Agamemnon, I beheld displayed on the grass the remains of the ham which had sustained so vigorous an attack on the preceding evening, accompanied by the reliques of the bread, cheese, and wine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正要开始吃简单的早餐时，我又一次听到了模仿绵羊的咩咩叫声，跟我前一天听到的声音极为相似。队长用同样的音调回复了它。两个男人很快从我们前一晚过夜的森林高处走了下来。待走近一看，原来是哨兵和送信人。队长起身走了上去。他打了个手势，让他的伙伴们一起过去。他们简短地商讨了一会儿，然后就迫不及待地向我走来。“你的赎金已经付过了”，他说道，“你自由了！”</td>
		<td class="en">We had scarcely commenced our frugal breakfast, when I heard again an imitation of the bleating of sheep, similar to what I had heard the day before.The captain answered it in the same tone.Two men were soon after seen descending from the woody height, where we had passed the preceding evening.On nearer approach, they proved to be the sentinel and the messenger.The captain rose and went to meet them.He made a signal for his comrades to join him.They had a short conference, and then returning to me with eagerness, “Your ransom is paid,” said he; “you are free!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管我早估计到自己会被释放，但当时听到这一消息时的喜悦之情依旧难以言表。我连饭都不吃了，而是准备离开。队长拉着我的手，请求我允许他给我写信，并恳求我不要忘了护照的事情。我回答说，我希望能够帮上他，而且既然现在现金已付，我也相信他会把五百美元的清单还给公爵。他吃惊地看了我一会儿；接着仿佛醒悟了过来。“清单在这里，”他说，“再见！”他把清单给我，又紧握了一下我的手，我们便道别了。几个劳工也得到许可，同我一起离开，我们兴高采烈地踏上了回土司库鲁的大路。</td>
		<td class="en">Though I had anticipated deliverance, I cannot tell you what a rush of delight these tidings gave me.I cared not to finish my repast, but prepared to depart.The captain took me by the hand; requested permission to write to me, and begged me not to forget the passport.I replied, that I hoped to be of effectual service to him, and that I relied on his honor to return the prince’s note for five hundred dollars, now that the cash was paid.He regarded me for a moment with surprise; then, seeming to recollect himself, “E giusto,” said he, “eccoloadio!”He delivered me the note, pressed my hand once more, and we separated.The laborers were permitted to follow me, and we resumed with joy our road towards Tusculum.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个艺术家不说话了，大家就这样沉默地继续沿泰拉奇纳海岸走了一会儿。这个故事给大家留下了很深刻的印象，特别是那位从威尼斯来的夫人，她逐渐地重新挽住了她丈夫的手臂。听到弗洛西诺内年轻姑娘的那一节，她感触很深；她开始抽泣起来，紧紧贴在她丈夫的身上，仰望着他，仿佛在寻求保护一般。她那美丽白皙的面颊，由于恐惧，在月光的映射下显得比以往更加苍白。眼泪也在她美丽的黑眼睛里一闪一闪。每当听到故事的凄惨之处，她便会颤颤发抖，低声喊着：“噢，亲爱的！”</td>
		<td class="en">The artist ceased to speak; the party continued for a few moments to pace the shore of Terracina in silence.The story they had heard had made a deep impression on them, particularly on the fair Venetian, who had gradually regained her husband’s arm.At the part that related to the young girl of Frosinone, she had been violently affected; sobs broke from her; she clung close to her husband, and as she looked up to him as if for protection, the moon-beams shining on her beautifully fair countenance showed it paler than usual with terror, while tears glittered in her fine dark eyes.“O caro mio!” would she murmur, shuddering at every atrocious circumstance of the story.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“勇敢些，亲爱的！”她丈夫说，温柔且爱抚地轻轻拍拍挽在他胳膊上的那只白皙的手。</td>
		<td class="en">“Corragio, mia vita!” was the reply, as the husband gently and fondly tapped the white hand that lay upon his arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个英国人一晚上都保持他惯有的冷漠态度，让这位威尼斯夫人颇不高兴。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管在意大利热情殷勤的环境中，很少有人会这样疏忽冷落他人，她依旧原谅了英国人对自己的冷漠态度。但是这个英国人对深深影响她的事情表保持无声的冷漠，就连对震撼自己的故事也是后知后觉，确实很令人讨厌。</td>
		<td class="en">She had pardoned him a want of gallantry towards herself, though a sin of omission seldom met with in the gallant climate of Italy, but the quiet coolness which he maintained in matters which so much affected her, and the slow credence which he had given to the stories which had filled her with alarm, were quite vexatious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚上回到屋里，她跟丈夫说：“天哪，这些英国人怎么如此麻木不仁！”</td>
