		<td class="en">By Jack London</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，老实说，鲍勃，现在我真觉得我生得太晚了。二十世纪没有我的容身之地。要是我能随心所欲——”</td>
		<td class="en">“No; honest, now, Bob, I’m sure I was born too late.The twentieth century’s no place for me.If I’d had my way—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你应该生在十六世纪，”我打断他，笑着说，“和德雷克、霍金斯、罗利还有其他海盗头子一起。”“你说对了！”保罗承认道。他翻身躺在小小的后甲板上，不满地长叹了一口气。刚过午夜，我们差不多是乘着风从下旧金山湾驶往湾田岛。保罗·费尔法克斯和我在同一所学校读书，又是邻居，就成了朋友。我和保罗攒钱、挣钱，他生日时我们都没买自行车，终于凑够了买“薄雾号”的钱。“薄雾号”船身宽大，有28英尺宽，装有单桅帆船的索具，还有小型的上桅帆和中插板。保罗的爸爸是一名帆船运动员，他帮我们开展了这次航海活动，四处查看，检修，还将他的小刀插到船骨里，很认真地检测了木壳板。事实上，正是在他的纵帆船“奇想号”上，保罗和我才对航海有所了解。现在既然“薄雾号”已经属于我们，我们就努力干活，丰富自己的航海知识。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’d have been born in the sixteenth,” I broke in, laughing, “with Drake and Hawkins and Raleigh and the rest of the sea-kings.”“You’re right!” Paul affirmed.He rolled over upon his back on the little after-deck, with a long sigh of dissatisfaction.It was a little past midnight, and, with the wind nearly astern, we were running down Lower San Francisco Bay to Bay Farm Island.Paul Fairfax and I went to the same school, lived next door to each other, and “chummed it” together.By saving money, by earning more, and by each of us foregoing a bicycle on his birthday, we had collected the purchase price of the Mist, a beamy twenty-eight-footer, sloop-rigged, with baby topsail and centerboard.Paul’s father was a yachtsman himself, and he had conducted the business for us, poking around, overhauling, sticking his penknife into the timbers, and testing the planks with the greatest care.In fact, it was on his schooner, the Whim, that Paul and I had picked up what we knew about boat-sailing, and now that the Mist was ours, we were hard at work adding to our knowledge.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“薄雾号”很宽，宽敞舒适。站在房舱里完全可以直起身子。由于有火炉、炊具和床铺，我们可以一次在上面航行一周。我们这就要起航了，这样的航行还是第一次，因为这是我们第一次在夜间航行。傍晚时分，我们从奥克兰迎风出发，现在已离开阿拉梅达河河口，那是一个巨大的海水河口，水注入圣利安卓海湾，又从那里流出。</td>
		<td class="en">The Mist, being broad of beam, was comfortable and roomy.A man could stand upright in the cabin, and what with the stove, cooking utensils, and bunks, we were good for trips in her of a week at a time.And we were just starting out on the first of such trips, and it was because it was the first trip that we were sailing by night.Early in the evening we had beaten out from Oakland, and we were now off the mouth of Alameda Creek, a large salt-water estuary which fills and empties San Leandro Bay.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“生活在那个年代的人，”保罗突然说道，把陷入沉思的我吓了一跳，“我是说有海盗头子的那些日子。”他解释道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Men lived in those days,” Paul said, so suddenly as to startle me from my own thoughts.“In the days of the sea-kings, I mean,” he explained.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我“哦”了一声以示理解，开始用口哨吹着“基德船长”的调调。</td>
		<td class="en">I said “Oh!” sympathetically, and began to whistle “Captain Kidd.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，我有了自己的想法。”保罗继续道，“他们谈论浪漫、冒险和诸如此类的东西，可我认为浪漫和冒险都过时了。我们太文明了。二十世纪没有冒险。我们去马戏团——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, I’ve my ideas about things,” Paul went on.“They talk about romance and adventure and all that, but I say romance and adventure are dead.We’re too civilized.We don’t have adventures in the twentieth century.We go to the circus—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是——”我努力打断他，虽然他不会听我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“But—” I strove to interrupt, though he would not listen to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看这儿，鲍勃，”他说，“在你和我一起度过的那些日子里，我们有过什么冒险吗？诚然，有一次我们出去爬山，直到深夜才回来，我们很饿却毫发无损，那一次甚至都没有迷路。我们一直都知道自己在什么地方。我们只是走了一些路。我的意思是，我们从来没有被迫为生命而战。你明白吗？从来没有人朝我们开过枪，放过炮，或者拿着剑在我们头顶挥舞，或者——或者任何危险……</td>
		<td class="en">“You look here, Bob,” he said.“In all the time you and I’ve gone together what adventures have we had?True, we were out in the hills once, and didn’t get back till late at night, and we were good and hungry, but we weren’t even lost.We knew where we were all the time.It was only a case of walk.What I mean is, we’ve never had to fight for our lives.Understand?We’ve never had a pistol fired at us, or a cannon, or a sword waving over our heads, or—or anything....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你最好把主帆帆脚索松出三、四英尺来。”他绝望地说，好像松不松都影响不大。“风还在转向。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’d better slack away three or four feet of that main-sheet,” he said in a hopeless sort of way, as though it did not matter much anyway.“The wind’s still veering around.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，在以前，航海一直都是辉煌的冒险活动。”他继续说。“一个男孩子毕业后就当上见习船员，在几个星期的时间里都跟着西班牙大帆船队航行，或者给法国的武装民船固定桁端，或者——许多事情呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, in the old times the sea was one constant glorious adventure,” he continued.“A boy left school and became a midshipman, and in a few weeks was cruising after Spanish galleons or locking yard-arms with a French privateer, or—lots of things.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦——现在也有冒险活动。”我反驳说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well—there are adventures today,” I objected.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是保罗继续说他的，就好像我没有说话一样。</td>
		<td class="en">But Paul went on as though I had not spoken:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，我们从小学上到高中，从高中上到大学，然后进办公室，或者当医生，等等，所知道的冒险活动仅仅是书本上读到的那些。哎，就像我很确定我坐在单桅帆船“薄雾号”的船尾一样，我也很确定，如果真正的冒险来临，我们都不知道怎么办。现在看来，难道不是吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And today we go from school to high school, and from high school to college, and then we go into the office or become doctors and things, and the only adventures we know about are the ones we read in books.Why, just as sure as I’m sitting here on the stern of the sloop Mist, just so sure am I that we wouldn’t know what to do if a real adventure came along.Now, would we?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我不知道。”我不置可否地回答。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I don’t know,” I answered non-committally.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“到时候你不会是个懦夫吧？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, you wouldn’t be a coward, would you?” he demanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我确信我不会是个懦夫，也这么回答了他。</td>
		<td class="en">I was sure I wouldn’t and said so.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但你也不一定要做一个丢掉脑袋的懦夫，是吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But you don’t have to be a coward to lose your head, do you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我承认，或许勇敢的人好激动。</td>
		<td class="en">I agreed that brave men might get excited.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，这么说来，”保罗总结道，语气中带着悔意，“很可能我们会毁了冒险活动。真遗憾，我只能说遗憾了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, then,” Paul summed up, with a note of regret in his voice, “the chances are that we’d spoil the adventure.So it’s a shame, and that’s all I can say about it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可冒险的时候还没到呢。”我回答道，不愿意看保罗说些毫无意义的话。你看，在一些事情上，保罗是个很奇怪的人，我相当了解他。他读书很多，想象力敏捷，偶尔会陷入这种情绪之中。因此我说：“冒险的时候还没来呢，现在担心它被毁掉也是白担心。我们都知道，冒险的结果是很辉煌的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The adventure hasn’t come yet,” I answered, not caring to see him down in the mouth over nothing.You see, Paul was a peculiar fellow in some things, and I knew him pretty well.He read a good deal, and had a quick imagination, and once in a while he’d get into moods like this one.So I said, “The adventure hasn’t come yet, so there’s no use worrying about its being spoiled.For all we know, it might turn out splendidly.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >保罗沉默了一会儿，正当我认为他已经摆脱了那种情绪时，他突然说：</td>
		<td class="en">Paul didn’t say anything for some time, and I was thinking he was out of the mood, when he spoke up suddenly:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“想象一下，鲍勃·凯洛格，我们正在航行，就像现在这样，别管是什么原因，有一只船气势汹汹地冲向我们，上面的人都全副武装，你会怎么做来击退这些登船的人呢？你觉得你能应付吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Just imagine, Bob Kellogg, as we’re sailing along now, just as we are, and never mind what for, that a boat should bear down upon us with armed men in it, what would you do to repel boarders?Think you could rise to it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你会怎么做呢？”我尖锐地问，“记着，我们船上连一把猎枪都没有。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What would you do?” I asked pointedly.“Remember, we haven’t even a single shotgun aboard.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你会投降了？”他生气地问道，“假如他们要杀你呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You would surrender, then?” he demanded angrily.“But suppose they were going to kill you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我说的不是我会怎么做，”我生硬地回答，有些气恼，“我问的是你会怎么办，你没有任何武器。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m not saying what I’d do,” I answered stiffly, beginning to get a little angry myself.“I’m asking what you’d do, without weapons of any sort?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我会找个东西当武器。”他回答说。在我看来，他的回答很短暂。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’d find something,” he replied—rather shortly, I thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我咯咯地笑了起来。“那冒险活动就不会被毁了，是吧？你一直说的都是废话。”</td>
		<td class="en">I began to chuckle.“Then the adventure wouldn’t be spoiled, would it?And you’ve been talking rubbish.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >保罗划亮一根火柴，看了看手表，说快一点钟了——当争论不利于他时，他就会这么做。而且，这是我们最接近于吵架的一次，虽然我们刚成为朋友时也为琐事争吵。保罗又说话时，我看见前方有一点白光。</td>
		<td class="en">Paul struck a match, looked at his watch, and remarked that it was nearly one o’clock—a way he had when the argument went against him.Besides, this was the nearest we ever came to quarreling now, though our share of squabbles had fallen to us in the earlier days of our friendship.I had just seen a little white light ahead when Paul spoke again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是锚泊灯。”保罗说，“在那里停船倒是很有意思。可能是艘平底纵帆船，船尾很小的那种，你最好离他远点。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Anchor-light,” he said.“Funny place for people to drop the hook.It may be a scow-schooner with a dinky astern, so you’d better go wide.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我松开了“薄雾号”上的几根束帆绳，风吹起来了，我们以很平稳的速度奋力前行，离那光亮很远，路过时都看不清它是哪种船。突然，“薄雾号”缓慢而又平稳地慢了下来，好像是在烂泥上航行。我们俩都很吃惊。风比之前刮得更猛烈了，可我们却几乎停了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">I eased the Mist several points, and, the wind puffing up, we went plowing along at a pretty fair speed, passing the light so wide that we could not make out what manner of craft it marked.Suddenly the Mist slacked up in a slow and easy way, as though running upon soft mud.We were both startled.The wind was blowing stronger than ever, and yet we were almost at a standstill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这里是泥滩吗？从来没听说过！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mud-flat out here?Never heard of such a thing!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >保罗哼了下鼻子，表示不相信，他抓起船桨，在把它从船边插下去。船桨直直地往下伸，直到海水浸湿了他的手。没有底啊！我们全都惊呆了。海风呼啸而过，可“薄雾号”还在以蜗牛的速度向前滑行。“薄雾号”似乎哪里坏掉了，我掌着舵，唯一能做的就是不让船跟着风向跑。</td>
		<td class="en">So Paul exclaimed with a snort of unbelief, and, seizing an oar, shoved it down over the side.And straight down it went till the water wet his hand.There was no bottom!Then we were dumbfounded.The wind was whistling by, and still the Mist was moving ahead at a snail’s pace.There seemed something dead about her, and it was all I could do at the tiller to keep her from swinging up into the wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听！”我将手放在保罗的胳膊上。我们能听见浆架的声音，能看见那小小的白光在水面忽上忽下，现在它离我们很近了。“你全副武装的船只来了，”我低声调侃道，“召唤所有船员进入岗位，作好准备，击退这些登船的人！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Listen!”I laid my hand on Paul’s arm.We could hear the sound of rowlocks, and saw the little white light bobbing up and down and now very close to us.“There’s your armed boat,” I whispered in fun.“Beat the crew to quarters and stand by to repel boarders!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我俩都笑了，正笑着，黑暗中就传来一阵狂怒的叫喊，逼近的船只在我们的船尾下方开枪了。透过那艘船上的灯笼的亮光，我们可以清晰地看到船上的两个男人。他们看起来像外国人，脸被太阳晒成了古铜色，头上像水手那样戴着针织圆帽。腰上系着闪亮的羊毛腰带，腿上是长长的高筒橡皮靴。我还记得，当我注意到其中一个船员耳朵上戴着极小的金耳环时，一阵寒意爬过我的脊背。他们完全就是从浪漫主义小说中走出来的海盗。再加上他们因愤怒而扭曲的脸，还有每个人手中挥舞的长刀，图画就完整了。他们俩都尖声叫喊着，他们说的是外国话，我们听不懂。</td>
		<td class="en">We both laughed, and were still laughing when a wild scream of rage came out of the darkness, and the approaching boat shot under our stern.By the light of the lantern it carried we could see the two men in it distinctly.They were foreign-looking fellows with sun-bronzed faces, and with knitted tam-o’-shanters perched seaman fashion on their heads.Bright-colored woolen sashes were around their waists, and long sea-boots covered their legs.I remember yet the cold chill which passed along my backbone as I noted the tiny gold ear-rings in the ears of one.For all the world they were like pirates stepped out of the pages of romance.And, to make the picture complete, their faces were distorted with anger, and each flourished a long knife.They were both shouting, in high-pitched voices, some foreign jargon we could not understand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们当中个头较小的那个人看起来比谁都邪恶，他把手放在“薄雾号”的舷栏上，开始登船。保罗快如闪电，用船桨的尾端对着那人的胸部就是一下，猛地把他推回船上。他蜷成一团摔在地上，但赶忙站起身来，挥舞着长刀，尖叫着：</td>
		<td class="en">One of them, the smaller of the two, and if anything the more vicious-looking, put his hands on the rail of the Mist and started to come aboard.Quick as a flash Paul placed the end of the oar against the man’s chest and shoved him back into his boat.He fell in a heap, but scrambled to his feet, waving the knife and shrieking:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们撕破了我的网！你们撕破了我的网！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You break-a my net-a!You break-a my net-a!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又滔滔不绝地说着他们的语言，他的同伙也加入了他，他俩都准备再次猛冲，登上“薄雾号”。</td>
		<td class="en">And he held forth in the jargon again, his companion joining him, and both preparing to make another dash to come aboard the Mist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们是意大利渔民，”我大喊道，知道怎么回事了，“我们撞上了他们的渔网，船的龙骨拖着渔网往前走，舵便被渔网缠住了。我们被迫抛锚到渔网上了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They’re Italian fishermen,” I cried, the facts of the case breaking in upon me.“We’ve run over their smelt-net, and it’s slipped along the keel and fouled our rudder.We’re anchored to it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，可这两个家伙也很凶狠。”保罗说，用船桨攻击他们，以和他们保持距离。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, and they’re murderous chaps, too,” Paul said, sparring at them with the oar to make them keep their distance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喂，伙计们！”他朝他们大喊，“给我们一次机会，我们会把渔网跟船分开的！我们不知道你们的网在那儿。你看，我们不是有意的！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Say, you fellows!” he called to them.“Give us a chance and we’ll get it clear for you!We didn’t know your net was there.We didn’t mean to do it, you know!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们不会有损失的！”我补充道，“我们赔偿你们！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You won’t lose anything!” I added.“We’ll pay the damages!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是他们听不懂我们在说什么，或者根本就不想听懂。</td>
		<td class="en">But they could not understand what we were saying, or did not care to understand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们撕破了我的网！你们撕破了我的网！”那个戴耳环的小个子男人一边向我们吼，一边做着恼怒的手势。“我要收拾你们！你们等着，我要收拾你们！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You break-a my net-a!You break-a my net-a!” the smaller man, the one with the ear-rings, screamed back, making furious gestures.“I fix-a you!You-a see, I fix-a you!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一次，当保罗使劲把他推回去时，他双手抓住了船桨，他的同伙跳上了船。我背靠着舵柄，他刚一上船，还没站稳，我就用另一只船桨给了他一下，他重重地向后摔在他们的船上。可事情严重起来了。他起身抓住我的船桨，我意识到他力气很大，我承认我很害怕。虽然他比我强壮，不过在他猛拧船桨时，他并没把我拉下船，只是把他的船拉得更近了。我用力推了一下，他们的船便后退了。而且，他右手还攥着刀，这让他行动笨拙，有点削弱了他的超大力气给他的优势。保罗和他的对手也是同样的处境——都陷入了僵局，这僵局延续了几秒钟，但没有持续下去。有几次，我都喊着，不管他们的网有什么损失我们全都赔偿，但我的话似乎并不起什么作用。</td>
		<td class="en">This time, when Paul thrust him back, he seized the oar in his hands, and his companion jumped aboard.I put my back against the tiller, and no sooner had he landed, and before he had caught his balance, than I met him with another oar, and he fell heavily backward into the boat.It was getting serious, and when he arose and caught my oar, and I realized his strength, I confess that I felt a goodly tinge of fear.But though he was stronger than I, instead of dragging me overboard when he wrenched on the oar, he merely pulled his boat in closer; and when I shoved, the boat was forced away.Besides, the knife, still in his right hand, made him awkward and somewhat counterbalanced the advantage his superior strength gave him.Paul and his enemy were in the same situation—a sort of deadlock, which continued for several seconds, but which could not last.Several times I shouted that we would pay for whatever damage their net had suffered, but my words seemed to be without effect.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来，我的对手开始用胳膊夹住船桨，他顺着船桨，双手交替着、慢慢地走上前来。那个小个子男人也是这么对付保罗的。时间一分一秒地过去，他们离我们越来越近，我们知道，结局只不过是时间问题。</td>
		<td class="en">Then my man began to tuck the oar under his arm, and to come up along it, slowly, hand over hand.The small man did the same with Paul.Moment by moment they came closer and closer, and we knew that the end was only a question of time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“满舵，鲍勃！”保罗轻轻地对我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hard up, Bob!” Paul called softly to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我飞快地扫了他一眼，瞥见了在我看来非常苍白的脸和十分僵硬的下巴。</td>
		<td class="en">I gave him a quick glance, and caught an instant’s glimpse of what I took to be a very pale face and a very set jaw.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“鲍勃，”他恳求道，“满舵！满舵，鲍勃！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, Bob,” he pleaded, “hard up your helm!Hard up your helm, Bob!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我终于明白他的意思了。我还握着船桨的一端，于是用后背去推舵柄，我甚至要弯下腰来去推它。迎风的“薄雾号”一动不动，这一招一定能让它的主帆从一舷转到另一舷。凭着“感觉”，我可以辨别出风从船帆涌出，帆桁向上偏斜。现在保罗的对手在小甲板上立住脚，而我的对手正在向上爬。</td>
		<td class="en">And his meaning dawned upon me.Still holding to my end of the oar, I shoved the tiller over with my back, and even bent my body to keep it over.As it was that Mist was nearly dead before the wind, and this maneuver was bound to force her to jibe her main-sail from one side to the other.I could tell by the “feel” when the wind spilled out of the canvas and the boom tilted up.Paul’s man had now gained a footing on the little deck, and my man was just scrambling up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当心！”我向保罗大喊道，“船要倾斜了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Look out!” I shouted to Paul.“Here she comes!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我和保罗松开船桨，跌跌撞撞地跑进驾驶舱。一瞬间，硕大的帆桁和沉重的船木掠过了我们的头顶，主帆像一条盘着的巨蛇一般倏地掠过。猛地一震，“薄雾号”倾侧了。这两个人都吓了一跳，但不知怎么的，那个小个子男人拿刀的手被挤到了，或者是被刀划伤了，我们第一眼看到他时，他正站在自己的船上，用两膝紧紧夹着流血的手指，面部扭曲，带着痛苦与抑制不住的愤怒。</td>
		<td class="en">Both he and I let go the oars and tumbled into the cockpit.The next instant the big boom and the heavy blocks swept over our heads, the main-sheet whipping past like a great coiling snake and the Mist heeling over with a violent jar.Both men had jumped for it, but in some way the little man either got his knife-hand jammed or fell upon it, for the first sight we caught of him, he was standing in his boat, his bleeding fingers clasped close between his knees and his face all twisted with pain and helpless rage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在我们的机会来了！”保罗小声说，“你们完了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now’s our chance!” Paul whispered.“Over with you!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在船舵的两边，我们弯下身去，跳进水里，用脚将网向下扯，直到猛地一下，网被清除了。之后渔网向上浮起，又进入水里。保罗站在主帆旁，而我站在舵旁，“薄雾号”自由地向前行进着，那艘船船尾的微弱白光也越来越小。</td>
		<td class="en">And on either side of the rudder we lowered ourselves into the water, pressing the net down with our feet, till, with a jerk, it went clear.Then it was up and in, Paul at the main-sheet and I at the tiller, the Mist plunging ahead with freedom in her motion, and the little white light astern growing small and smaller.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你已经冒过险了，现在是不是满足了？”我记得，我问他这话时，我们已经换上了干衣服，正舒舒服服地坐在驾驶舱里。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now that you’ve had your adventure, do you feel any better?”I remember asking when we had changed our clothes and were sitting dry and comfortable again in the cockpit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果未来一个星期我不做噩梦的话，”保罗停顿了一下，法官似的皱了皱眉头，“那就是因为我根本睡不着觉，这是一定的！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, if I don’t have the nightmare for a week to come”—Paul paused and puckered his brows in judicial fashion—“it will be because I can’t sleep, that’s one thing sure!”</td></tr>
