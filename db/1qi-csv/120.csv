"红死病魔的面具","The Masque of the Red Death"
"作者：埃德加·爱伦·坡","by Edgar Allan Poe"
"红死病肆虐已久，举国颓败。这是一场有史以来最是可怕致命的流行病。鲜红的血液是“红死病”恐怖的症状和标志。此病的症状是剧烈的疼痛伴随着突如其来的晕眩，而后毛孔中鲜血四溢，直至死亡。患者的全身，尤其是脸上会出现猩红色的斑点。这些斑点便使是这种流行病的禁令，同伴避之唯恐不及，绝不会有人对他们施以同情或救助。此病从感染、发作到结束不过半个小时的时间。","The “Red Death” had long devastated the country.No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous.Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the redness and the horror of blood.There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men.And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour."
"不过普洛斯彼罗亲王依旧快活无畏，沉着睿智。在他的子民已死伤过半之时，他从王国的骑士和少女中挑选出一千位身强力壮且泰然乐观的同伴，和他们一起退守隐居在一座城堡式的教堂中。这教堂宽敞而雄伟，依照亲王的品味建得古怪而庄严。它被高耸坚实的墙包围着。墙上装着铁制的大门。侍臣们进入到这里后就用火炉和巨锤将门闩焊上了。他们决不容许因绝望和疯狂而一时冲动的进出行为。教堂内供给充足。有了这些保障，侍臣们便可以抵御那流行病了。任外界自生自灭去吧。在这种时候，忧心或是思考全都是愚蠢的。亲王准备好了所有可供享乐之物。小丑、即兴诗人、芭蕾舞者、乐师、佳人、美酒等，一应俱全。除了这些以外，在城堡内还可尽享安全。城堡外却在“红死病”的掌控之下。","But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious.When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys.This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august taste.A strong and lofty wall girdled it in.This wall had gates of iron.The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within.The abbey was amply provisioned.With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion.The external world could take care of itself.In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think.The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure.There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine.All these and security were within.Without was the “Red Death.”"
"这种隐居生活过到第五或第六个月终之时，红死病在外界的肆虐已达顶峰，而普洛斯彼罗亲王却举办了一次非比寻常的假面舞会，以娱千位友人。","It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence."
"舞会上自是一派纵情声色的景象。但先让我来介绍一下举办舞会的场所——共七间的一套皇家套房。","It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade.But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven—an imperial suite."
"在许多宫殿里，这种套间会形成一个长且直的长廊，而当折叠式的门向两侧打开至墙边时，套间内的景致可悉数尽览。不过，鉴于公爵的奇特品味，这个套间与别处自是大相径庭。此套间的设置极为不同寻常，一次只能看全一个隔间而非全景。每二十或三十码处都有个急转弯，绕过每个转弯，都有别样景致。左右两侧的墙中间，都有一扇哥特式的长窄窗，窗外便是套间那些曲曲折折的封闭式回廊。这些窗上装着彩色玻璃，玻璃的颜色依窗内房间的主色调而有所不同。例如，最东边的房间的挂毯是蓝色的，窗子的颜色便是鲜蓝的。第二隔间的饰物和挂毯是紫色的，窗玻璃便是紫色的。第三隔间通间都是碧绿色，窗扉便也是如此。第四隔间的家具和灯光是橘色的，第五间是白色的，第六间是紫罗兰色的。第七隔间从天花板到整个墙都用黑天鹅绒挂毯严严实实地遮着，与相同质地、相同颜色的地毯堆叠相接。但唯有这个隔间，窗子的颜色与房间色调相违。窗玻璃是猩红色——血液般的深红色。所有的隔间都有着铺天盖地的黄金饰物，或散布在地上，或垂挂于屋顶，但竟都没有一盏灯或一个烛台。整个套间内没有任何灯光烛光。不过在套间外的回廊里，与窗户相对的地方都有一个三脚架，上面载着一个火盆，火焰被包在玻璃罩子里，将屋子照得光亮。这便形成了许多花哨而奇妙的景观。然而，在最西边的黑色套间内，火光透过血色的玻璃照射在暗黑的挂饰上，异常可怖，使得进来的每个人都大惊失色，其他同伴几乎无人敢踏入一步。","In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke’s love of the bizarre.The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time.There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect.To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite.These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened.That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue—and vividly blue were its windows.The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple.The third was green throughout, and so were the casements.The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the sixth with violet.The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue.But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations.The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood color.Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof.There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers.But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that protected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room.And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances.But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all."
"也是在此隔间中，西墙边立有一只巨大的乌木钟。钟摆左摇右摆，发出乏味、沉重且单调的叮当声。当分针走完一圈，小时的钟声便会敲响，自那黄铜内腔发出的声音清晰响亮，深沉而又极富音乐性。但那调子和又是极不寻常的，使得乐队里演奏的乐师们每过一小时都会暂时停下去聆听。此时跳着华尔兹的人们便会骤然停下脚步，整个狂欢的人群一时窘然。而当钟声鸣响之时，便可见那最是轻浮之人面色惨白，较为年长和持重的人则以手覆额，仿佛陷入沉思冥想之中。然当回音散尽，人群中即发出轻笑声；乐师们面面相觑地笑着，如同嘲笑自己的紧张和傻气一般，还相互低声起誓，下一次钟鸣绝不可如此。但六十分钟（即三千六百秒的时间）过后，又会出现和之前一样的窘然，颤动和冥想。","It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony.Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation.But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before."
"不过除开此些琐事，这依旧是一场欢乐的、奢华的狂欢会。公爵的品味的确不同寻常。他对于色彩和效果别具慧眼。对于所谓的流行装修，他不屑一顾。他的设计大胆而热烈，他的理念闪耀着野性的光辉。有些人会觉得他疯了。他的追随者却不觉得。只有去倾听，细看和接触，才能肯定他没有疯。","But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.The tastes of the duke were peculiar.He had a fine eye for colors and effects.He disregarded the decora of mere fashion.His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre.There are some who would have thought him mad.His followers felt that he was not.It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not."
"七套间的大部分可移动装饰都是他为了这次盛大的宴会而亲临指导布置的。以他的审美为主导，这场假面舞会自然别具特色。一切必然都是光怪陆离的。光影交织，如梦似幻，此情此景只有在歌剧《欧那尼》中才能得见。这里有如同四肢不协调的阿拉伯式的雕像。有的摆设则像是癫狂之人的想象之作。大多极尽华丽、荒唐和怪诞之能事，有的甚至近乎恐怖，但绝不会令人作呕。在七间隔间内逡巡着的，其实不过一群梦中人罢了。而这些梦中人在隔间内扭动着身体，映射出房间里的那种色调，这让乐队演奏的狂野音乐像极了他们步伐的回声。不久，黑天鹅绒隔间大厅内的乌木钟敲响了。随即便有片刻的静止，除了钟声外一片寂静。梦中人僵直而立。但当钟声的回音散尽之时——那回音也仅延续了一小会儿——一阵轻微的略有抑制的笑声便会响起，随即又随那钟声远去。音乐再度响起，梦中人复再入梦，在隔间里更加快活地左右扭动，身上摇曳着从窗外射入的三脚架处所发出的光线和色彩。不过，戴面具的舞者还未有敢涉足最西头的隔间的。夜色正逐渐褪去，血色的窗玻璃透出一种更为鲜红的色彩，黑色帷幔的阴气令人惊惧。一旦踏上暗黑地毯，一旁的乌木钟传来的沉闷钟声便扑耳而来，比远一些的其他房间中尽情狂欢的人们听到的都要庄严沉重。","He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders.Be sure they were grotesque.There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm—much of what has been since seen in “Hernani.”There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments.There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions.There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.And these—the dreams—writhed in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock.The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.But the echoes of the chime die away—they have endured but an instant—and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart.And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments."
"但其他的房间中挤得满满当当，生命的心脏在强有力地跳动着。狂欢依旧肆无忌惮。直到，午夜的钟声响起。如我所说，音乐忽停，舞者止步，和前几次一样，一切戛然而止。但这次将有十二声钟响，持续时间更长，如此一来，狂欢人群中那些有思想的人们便有更多的时间来思考和冥想。因而当第十二声钟声的余韵完全响尽之前，人群中的很多人便有空注意到了一个戴面具的人，之前他还未引起任何一个人的注意。关于这位新来成员的议论悄声传播着，最后，人群中响起了一阵嗡嗡声，或说是低语，表达着不满和惊讶——而后，最终变成了害怕，恐惧和厌恶。","But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before.And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust."
"在我前面描述过的这个奇幻的假面舞会上，没有任何寻常的行头会让人产生这种感觉。事实上今晚的假面舞会并无禁忌，但这个话题人物实在比希律王更恐怖，完全超出了亲王那几乎没有的限制。便是那最是不计后果之人，亦有可被触动的心弦。便是将生死当作儿戏的彻底迷失的人，也有不可儿戏之事。现在所有人都深深觉得，这个陌生人的化装和举止毫不风趣，也无得体可言。这人个头高挑，却形容枯槁，从头到脚包裹在一件寿衣之中。遮住他面容的面具做得极为逼真，和僵尸的脸一模一样，就算是凑得再近也无法识破。不过对周围疯狂的狂欢者来说，这即便是令人不适，也并非难以忍受。但这伶人竟扮成了红死病魔。他的衣服为鲜血所染，他宽阔的额头，以及脸上的五官全都布满了恐怖的猩红色。","In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince’s indefinite decorum.There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made.The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave.The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around.But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death.His vesture was dabbled in blood—and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror."
"当普洛斯彼罗亲王看向这个幽灵似的人物时（此时这人缓慢而肃穆地在跳着华尔兹的人们中间移动穿行，似乎正致力于扮演自己的角色），亲王似是为其所撼，先是出于恐惧或厌恶猛地一抖，但随之，他的额头因为盛怒而变得通红。","When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage."
"“是谁如此大胆？”他嘶哑着命令身边的侍臣们：“是谁胆敢用这亵渎神灵的嘲弄来冒犯我等？把他抓起来，脱下他的面具——让我等看一看他的真面目，日出就将他绞死在城垛上！“","“Who dares?”he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him—“who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery?Seize him and unmask him—that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the battlements!”"
"当普洛斯彼罗亲王说出这些话时，他正站在东边蓝色的隔间里。这话响亮清晰，传遍了七间套间——因为亲王是个勇敢强壮的人，音乐声也在他挥手之后停了下来。","It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words.They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly—for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand."
"亲王和他身边吓得脸色惨白的侍臣们此时正站在蓝色隔间内。刚开始，亲王讲话的时候，这伙人还向这侵略者略微急促地移动了一下，而此时，那人已然近在咫尺，正迈着从容庄严的脚步向亲王逐渐逼近。但这伶人的狂妄给所有人感到了某种莫名的敬畏，因而在场之人竟无人敢伸手抓住他。因此，他毫无阻碍地从离亲王仅一码之处走过，而众人似受到了推动一般，从屋子中央退守到了墙边。他一往无前，始终迈着初时让他显得与众不同的庄严缓慢的步子。他穿过了蓝色的隔间到了紫色的隔间，穿过紫色的隔间到了绿色的，然后穿过绿色的到了橘色的，而后又到了白色隔间——在有人决定抓住他之时，他已经进入紫罗兰隔间了。但便在此时，普洛斯彼罗亲王，因念着自己一时的胆怯，恼羞成怒，急促地穿过六间隔间。但众人陷在极度的恐惧中，竟无人跟随他。亲王举着出鞘宝剑，一个箭步就逼近到离那后退之三四尺之处，此时那人已进入黑天鹅绒隔间，忽地转身，与追他的亲王正面相对。一声尖叫，宝剑光寒，落在暗色的地毯上，普洛斯彼罗亲王的尸体随之俯身倒下。此时，一群狂欢者鼓起因绝望而生的狂野勇气，立时涌向黑色隔间内抓住了这个伶人。那高大的身影直直地伫立在乌木钟的影子中。而人们狂乱地抓开的那件寿衣和那个僵尸般的面具时，却发现里面空无一物，他们不由得倒吸了一口冷气，感受到了不可言喻的恐惧。","It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side.At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker.But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple—through the purple to the green—through the green to the orange—through this again to the white—and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him.It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.There was a sharp cry—and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero.Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form."
"如今，人们知道，红死病魔就在身边。他犹如黑夜中的盗贼般潜了进来。然后，狂欢的人一个个地被杀死，倒在狂欢大厅的血泊之中，死时还保持着倒下时绝望的姿势。乌木钟的生命也随着最后的欢娱而消逝。三脚架的火焰随之熄灭。黑暗、腐烂和红死病魔一统世界。","And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.He had come like a thief in the night.And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay.And the flames of the tripods expired."
