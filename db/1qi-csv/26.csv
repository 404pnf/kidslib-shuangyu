"第一章 矛盾的信件","CHAPTER I CONTRADICTORY LETTERS"
"致爱丁堡坎农格特30号，工程师F. R.斯塔尔先生。","To Mr. F. R. Starr, Engineer, 30 Canongate, Edinburgh."
"倘若詹姆斯·斯塔尔先生愿于明日光临阿伯福伊尔矿区多查特矿的亚罗矿井，他将获悉一则令他感兴趣的信息。","If Mr. James Starr will come to-morrow to the Aberfoyle coal-mines, Dochart pit, Yarrow shaft, a communication of an interesting nature will be made to him."
"“前任工头西蒙·福特之子哈里·福特，将在卡伦德站全天恭候詹姆斯·斯塔尔先生。”","“Mr. James Starr will be awaited for, the whole day, at the Callander station, by Harry Ford, son of the old overman Simon Ford.”"
"“请他务必对此邀请保密。”","“He is requested to keep this invitation secret.”"
"这是詹姆斯·斯塔尔在一八几几年十二月三日首次取信时收到的信件，信封上盖有苏格兰斯特林郡阿伯福伊尔邮局的邮戳。","Such was the letter which James Starr received by the first post, on the 3rd December, 18—, the letter bearing the Aberfoyle postmark, county of Stirling, Scotland."
"工程师的好奇心被激发至顶点。他从未怀疑过这封信是否是个骗局。他和西蒙·福特这位阿伯福伊尔煤矿前任工头相识多年，詹姆斯·斯塔尔曾担任该矿经理二十年，按英格兰矿业的说法，他这个职位应该叫做“监工”。詹姆斯·斯塔尔身强体壮，五十五岁的他看上去与四十岁的人没多少差别。他来自爱丁堡一个古老的家族，是这个家族里最优秀的成员之一。他的努力为整个工程师团队带来了荣誉，他们正逐渐毁灭联合王国的含炭层底土，既包括苏格兰南部各郡，也包括加的夫和纽卡斯尔。然而，在阿伯福伊尔煤矿与阿洛厄煤矿的毗邻之处，在那占据着斯特林郡一部分的神秘煤矿的深处，斯塔尔才最负盛名。在那儿，他度过了人生大部分时光。此外，詹姆斯·斯塔尔是苏格兰古物协会的成员，曾被任命为协会主席。他也是皇家学会中最活跃的成员之一；《爱丁堡评论》经常刊登署有他名字的睿智文章。事实上，他是务实派中的一员，英格兰的繁荣与这些人紧密相关。他在苏格兰的古老首府爱丁堡身居高位。无论从物质方面抑或从道德方面来看，这座城市都绝对担得起“北部雅典”这一美誉。","The engineer’s curiosity was excited to the highest pitch.It never occurred to him to doubt whether this letter might not be a hoax.For many years he had known Simon Ford, one of the former foremen of the Aberfoyle mines, of which he, James Starr, had for twenty years, been the manager, or, as he would be termed in English coal-mines, the viewer.James Starr was a strongly-constituted man, on whom his fifty-five years weighed no more heavily than if they had been forty.He belonged to an old Edinburgh family, and was one of its most distinguished members.His labors did credit to the body of engineers who are gradually devouring the carboniferous subsoil of the United Kingdom, as much at Cardiff and Newcastle, as in the southern counties of Scotland.However, it was more particularly in the depths of the mysterious mines of Aberfoyle, which border on the Alloa mines and occupy part of the county of Stirling, that the name of Starr had acquired the greatest renown.There, the greater part of his existence had been passed.Besides this, James Starr belonged to the Scottish Antiquarian Society, of which he had been made president.He was also included amongst the most active members of the Royal Institution; and the Edinburgh Review frequently published clever articles signed by him.He was in fact one of those practical men to whom is due the prosperity of England.He held a high rank in the old capital of Scotland, which not only from a physical but also from a moral point of view, well deserves the name of the Northern Athens."
"我们知道英国人给他们广阔的煤矿地区赋予了一个意味深长的名号。他们非常恰当地称之为“黑印度”，而在联合王国惊人的财富聚敛过程中，黑印度所做出的贡献可能比东印度更大。","We know that the English have given to their vast extent of coal-mines a very significant name.They very justly call them the “Black Indies,” and these Indies have contributed perhaps even more than the Eastern Indies to swell the surprising wealth of the United Kingdom."
"在这个时期，根据专业人员的预计，煤矿枯竭还为时尚早，不必担心煤资源短缺。在南美洲和北美洲仍有广阔的煤矿可供开采。制造厂若要制造机车、汽船或建煤气厂等等，它们不可能因为矿产燃料短缺就停产，但是近些年来矿产资源消耗急剧增加，导致某些煤床连最细小的矿脉也被采竭殆尽了。这些煤矿如今已荒废，只剩下无用的矿井和被遗弃的水平巷道，将土地毁得千疮百孔。这正是阿伯福伊尔矿的情况。十年前，最后一个采煤工头从该煤矿里运走了最后一吨煤。井下作业设备、牵引机车、沿着水平巷道轨道行驶的车皮、地下电车轨道、矿井支架以及管道——总之，矿井的所有设备都被从井下搬了出来。被挖掘一空的煤矿就像一个大得惊人的庞然大物的躯体，它被掏空了所有的生命器官，只剩下了骨架。","At this period, the limit of time assigned by professional men for the exhaustion of coal-mines was far distant and there was no dread of scarcity.There were still extensive mines to be worked in the two Americas.The manu-factories, appropriated to so many different uses, locomotives, steamers, gas works, &c., were not likely to fail for want of the mineral fuel; but the consumption had so increased during the last few years, that certain beds had been exhausted even to their smallest veins.Now deserted, these mines perforated the ground with their useless shafts and forsaken galleries.This was exactly the case with the pits of Aberfoyle.Ten years before, the last butty had raised the last ton of coal from this colliery.The underground working stock, traction engines, trucks which run on rails along the galleries, subterranean tramways, frames to support the shaft, pipes—in short, all that constituted the machinery of a mine had been brought up from its depths.The exhausted mine was like the body of a huge fantastically-shaped mastodon, from which all the organs of life have been taken, and only the skeleton remains."
"什么都没留下，只剩下通向亚罗井的长木梯——这是目前进入多查特矿井下层水平巷道的唯一通道。地面上，以前用于遮盖露天设备的工棚仍旧标示着矿井以前的挖掘位置。现在这口井和其他井一样都被废弃了，它们共同构成了阿伯福伊尔煤矿的全貌。","Nothing was left but long wooden ladders, down the Yarrow shaft—the only one which now gave access to the lower galleries of the Dochart pit.Above ground, the sheds, formerly sheltering the outside works, still marked the spot where the shaft of that pit had been sunk, it being now abandoned, as were the other pits, of which the whole constituted the mines of Aberfoyle."
"那是令人伤感的一天。那天工人们最后一次离开煤矿——那个他们曾经生活多年的地方。工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔将几百名工人召集起来。这是一群勤奋勇敢的煤矿工人。工头、司闸工、运煤工、清理工、填土工、泥瓦匠、铁匠、木匠、井上和井下的工人，以及妇女、孩子和老人，所有人都聚集在多查特矿井的大院子里；这里曾经堆满了开采出的煤。","It was a sad day, when for the last time the workmen quitted the mine, in which they had lived for so many years.The engineer, James Starr, had collected the hundreds of workmen which composed the active and courageous population of the mine.Overmen, brakemen, putters, wastemen, barrowmen, masons, smiths, carpenters, outside and inside laborers, women, children, and old men, all were collected in the great yard of the Dochart pit, formerly heaped with coal from the mine."
"这里很多家庭世世代代都生活在这古老的阿伯福伊尔煤矿，现在他们被迫即将去别处谋生计；他们正伤感地等着与工程师道别。","Many of these families had existed for generations in the mine of old Aberfoyle; they were now driven to seek the means of subsistence elsewhere, and they waited sadly to bid farewell to the engineer."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔笔直地站在大工棚的门口，他数年来就是在这里监管着矿井里那些大功率的机器。多查特矿的工头西蒙·福特那时五十五岁，和其他经理及工头们一道围在斯塔尔身边。詹姆斯·斯塔尔摘下帽子。矿工们手拿帽子，一直鸦雀无声。这离别的场景很感人，又不失庄重。","James Starr stood upright, at the door of the vast shed in which he had for so many years superintended the powerful machines of the shaft.Simon Ford, the foreman of the Dochart pit, then fifty-five years of age, and other managers and overseers, surrounded him.James Starr took off his hat.The miners, cap in hand, kept a profound silence.This farewell scene was of a touching character, not wanting in grandeur."
"“我的朋友们，”工程师说，“我们分别的时刻到了。阿伯福伊尔煤矿多年来将我们聚在一起，使我们共同从事这项普通的工作，如今煤矿已被开采殆尽了。我们所有的研究探测都没有发现新的矿脉，而最后一块煤也刚从多查特矿中开采出来了。”为了证明自己的话，詹姆斯·斯塔尔指了指放在筐子底部的那块煤。","“My friends,” said the engineer, “the time has come for us to separate.The Aberfoyle mines, which for so many years have united us in a common work, are now exhausted.All our researches have not led to the discovery of a new vein, and the last block of coal has just been extracted from the Dochart pit.”And in confirmation of his words, James Starr pointed to a lump of coal which had been kept at the bottom of a basket."
"“这块煤，我的朋友们，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔继续说道，“就像流淌在矿脉中的最后一滴血！我们将保存它，正如我们保存一百五十年前从阿伯福伊尔矿区采出的第一块煤屑那样。在第一块煤到这最后一块煤之间，有多少代工人在我们煤矿里前赴后继！此刻，一切都终结了！你们的工程师最后要向你们说的就是道别的话。你们曾经生活过的这个煤矿，已经在你们手中被挖空了。工作曾是艰难的，但对你们来说也并非没有收益。我们这个大家庭得散了，各奔东西的成员将来也不可能重聚在一起了。但请不要忘记，我们曾在一起生活了这么长时间；也不要忘记，相互扶持是每一个阿伯福伊尔矿工的责任。你们的前任工头们也不会忘记你们的。","“This piece of coal, my friends,” resumed James Starr, “is like the last drop of blood which has flowed through the veins of the mine!We shall keep it, as the first fragment of coal is kept, which was extracted a hundred and fifty years ago from the bearings of Aberfoyle.Between these two pieces, how many generations of workmen have succeeded each other in our pits!Now, it is over!The last words which your engineer will address to you are a farewell.You have lived in this mine, which your hands have emptied.The work has been hard, but not without profit for you.Our great family must disperse, and it is not probable that the future will ever again unite the scattered members.But do not forget that we have lived together for a long time, and that it will be the duty of the miners of Aberfoyle to help each other.Your old masters will not forget you either."
"曾在一起工作过的人们，是绝不会再视彼此为陌生人的。","When men have worked together, they must never be stranger to each other again."
"我们将关注着你们，无论你们到哪儿，我们都会一直推荐你们。再见了，我的朋友们，愿上苍与你们同在！”","We shall keep our eye on you, and wherever you go, our recommendations shall follow you.Farewell then, my friends, and may Heaven be with you!”"
"说完后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔紧紧握住最年长的矿工那粗糙的双手，老矿工的眼里因噙满泪水而视线模糊。随后，各个矿井的工头们上前与工程师握手；同时，矿工们挥动着他们的帽子，叫喊道，“再见了，詹姆斯·斯塔尔，我们的头儿！我们的朋友！”","So saying, James Starr wrung the horny hand of the oldest miner, whose eyes were dim with tears.Then the overmen of the different pits came forward to shake hands with him, whilst the miners waved their caps, shouting, “Farewell, James Starr, our master and our friend!”"
"这场离别将在所有这些人真诚的心里留下永久的回忆。人们缓慢而伤感地离开了院子。在通向多查特矿井的黑土路上，最后一次回响起矿工们行走的脚步声。那时阿伯福伊尔煤矿还是一派喧嚣景象，之后便沉寂了。","This farewell would leave a lasting remembrance in all these honest hearts.Slowly and sadly the population quitted the yard.The black soil of the roads leading to the Dochart pit resounded for the last time to the tread of miners’ feet, and silence succeeded to the bustling life which had till then filled the Aberfoyle mines."
"唯有一个人仍然留在詹姆斯·斯塔尔身边。这个人就是工头西蒙·福特。西蒙身旁站着一个男孩，大约十五岁，已经受雇在井下干了好几年了。","One man alone remained by James Starr.This was the overman, Simon Ford.Near him stood a boy, about fifteen years of age, who for some years already had been employed down below."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔和西蒙·福特彼此十分熟悉，相互敬重。“再见了，西蒙。”工程师说道。","James Starr and Simon Ford knew and esteemed each other well.“Good-by, Simon,” said the engineer."
"“再见了，斯塔尔先生，”工头回答道，“让我加上一句——直到我们再次见面！”","“Good-by, Mr. Starr,” replied the overman, “let me add, till we meet again!”"
"“是的，直到我们再次见面。福特！”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，“您知道，我将永远会为能见到您，并与您谈论昔日时光而感到高兴。”","“Yes, till we meet again.Ford!” answered James Starr.“You know that I shall be always glad to see you, and talk over old times.”"
"“我知道，斯塔尔先生。”","“I know that, Mr. Starr.”"
"“我在爱丁堡的家永远为您开放。”","“My house in Edinburgh is always open to you.”"
"“爱丁堡啊，离得太远了！”工头摇着头回答道，“啊，离多查特矿井太远了。”","“It’s a long way off, is Edinburgh!” answered the man shaking his head.“Ay, a long way from the Dochart pit.”"
"“太远了吗，西蒙？您打算住在哪儿？”","“A long way, Simon?Where do you mean to live?”"
"“就在这儿，斯塔尔先生！我们不打算离开煤矿，我们善良的老乳母，我们不会仅仅因为她的乳汁枯竭了就离开她！我的妻子、我的儿子和我，我们将会继续忠实于她！”","“Even here, Mr. Starr!We’re not going to leave the mine, our good old nurse, just because her milk is dried up!My wife, my boy, and myself, we mean to remain faithful to her!”"
"“那再见了，西蒙。”工程师回答道，他的声音不由自主地流露出些许激动。","“Good-by then, Simon,” replied the engineer, whose voice, in spite of himself, betrayed some emotion."
"“不，我对您说，我的意思是直到我们再次见面，斯塔尔先生，并不只是‘再见’，”工头回答道，“记住我的话，阿伯福伊尔会再次见到您的！”","“No, I tell you, it’s till we meet again, Mr. Starr, and not just ‘good-by,’” returned the foreman.“Mark my words, Aberfoyle will see you again!”"
"工程师不想驱散工头的幻想。他拍了拍哈里的头，再次紧紧握了握哈里父亲的手，然后离开了煤矿。","The engineer did not try to dispel the man’s illusion.He patted Harry’s head, again wrung the father’s hand, and left the mine."
"所有这些都发生在十年前；然而，尽管工头曾表达过要再次见到他的愿望，但在那期间，斯塔尔却从未听到过他的任何消息。分别十年后，他收到了这封来自西蒙·福特的信，要求他立即启程前往旧阿伯福伊尔煤矿。","All this had taken place ten years ago; but, notwithstanding the wish which the overman had expressed to see him again, during that time Starr had heard nothing of him.It was after ten years of separation that he got this letter from Simon Ford, requesting him to take without delay the road to the old Aberfoyle colliery."
"一则有趣的信息，那会是什么呢？多查特矿井。亚罗井！这些过去的名字唤起了他对昔日的无穷回忆！是的，那是一段美好的时光，是工作的时光，是战斗的时光——是工程师一生中最美好的时光。斯塔尔重读了西蒙的来信。他反复斟酌了信里所有的信息。他很惋惜，西蒙一行字也没多写。他希望西蒙不要如此惜字如金。","A communication of an interesting nature, what could it be?Dochart pit.Yarrow shaft!What recollections of the past these names brought back to him!Yes, that was a fine time, that of work, of struggle,—the best part of the engineer’s life.Starr re-read his letter.He pondered over it in all its bearings.He much regretted that just a line more had not been added by Ford.He wished he had not been quite so laconic."
"有可能是老工头已经发现了某个新矿脉吗？不会！斯塔尔记得，在确定终止工程前，煤矿曾被非常细致入微地勘探过。他曾亲自探测过最底层，向各个方向进行了挖掘，也没在土壤中发现丝毫煤的踪迹。他们甚至试图在那些通常处于煤层之下的地层中寻找，如泥盆纪的红砂岩，却毫无所获。所以，詹姆斯·斯塔尔断定煤矿里一块煤也不会再有了，便遗弃了它。“不可能，”他重复道，“不可能！怎么可能会有任何东西能逃脱我的搜寻，而被西蒙·福特发现了呢？但是，老工头必定清楚，这一发现会是这世上唯一令我感兴趣的东西，并且这个让我务必保密的邀请是让我回去修复多查特矿井！”詹姆斯·斯塔尔总是回到这一点上。","Was it possible that the old foreman had discovered some new vein?No!Starr remembered with what minute care the mines had been explored before the definite cessation of the works.He had himself proceeded to the lowest soundings without finding the least trace in the soil, burrowed in every direction.They had even attempted to find coal under strata which are usually below it, such as the Devonian red sandstone, but without result.James Starr had therefore abandoned the mine with the absolute conviction that it did not contain another bit of coal.“No,” he repeated, “no!How is it possible that anything which could have escaped my researches, should be revealed to those of Simon Ford.However, the old overman must well know that such a discovery would be the one thing in the world to interest me, and this invitation, which I must keep secret, to repair to the Dochart pit!”James Starr always came back to that."
"另一方面，工程师知道福特是个聪明的矿工，对他的职业尤其拥有敏锐的直觉。自从阿伯福伊尔煤矿被遗弃后，他就再也没见过福特，不知道福特现在在做些什么，也不知道福特和他的妻儿住在哪儿。现在，他所知道的全部信息是，在亚罗井已为他安排了一个约会，并且西蒙·福特的儿子哈里明天将在卡伦德站全天恭候着他。“我得去，我得去！”斯塔尔说道，时间越近，他便越发激动。","On the other hand, the engineer knew Ford to be a clever miner, peculiarly endowed with the instinct of his trade.He had not seen him since the time when the Aberfoyle colliery was abandoned, and did not know either what he was doing or where he was living, with his wife and his son.All that he now knew was, that a rendezvous had been appointed him at the Yarrow shaft, and that Harry, Simon Ford’s son, was to wait for him during the whole of the next day at the Callander station.“I shall go, I shall go!” said Starr, his excitement increasing as the time drew near."
"我们这位受人敬仰的工程师属于这样一类人，他们的脑袋总是十分活跃，就像旺火上的水壶那样。在有些人那类似水壶的脑袋里，各种念头高速沸腾着；而在另一部分人的脑袋里，它们只是慢慢煨着。如今，就在这天，詹姆斯·斯塔尔的念头正高速沸腾翻滚。","Our worthy engineer belonged to that class of men whose brain is always on the boil, like a kettle on a hot fire.In some of these brain kettles the ideas bubble over, in others they just simmer quietly.Now on this day, James Starr’s ideas were boiling fast."
"但突然间，一件意料之外的事情发生了。这像是一滴冷水，瞬间冷凝住工程师脑袋里所有的水蒸汽。大约在傍晚六点，斯塔尔的仆人第三次去取信时，带给他当天的第二封信。这封信装在一个粗陋的信封里，很明显是出自一个不习惯写字的人之手。詹姆斯·斯塔尔撕开了信封。信封里面只有一张因年久而发黄的小纸片，显然是从一本旧抄写本上撕下来的。","But suddenly an unexpected incident occurred.This was the drop of coldwater, which in a moment was to condense all the vapors of the brain.About six in the evening, by the third post, Starr’s servant brought him a second letter.This letter was enclosed in a coarse envelope, and evidently directed by a hand unaccustomed to the use of a pen.James Starr tore it open.It contained only a scrap of paper, yellowed by time, and apparently torn out of an old copy book."
"在这张纸片上只写了这样一句话：“工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔没必要劳心费神，因为西蒙·福特的信如今已没有意义了。”","On this paper was written a single sentence, thus worded: “It is useless for the engineer James Starr to trouble himself, Simon Ford’s letter being now without object.”"
"没有落款。","No signature."
"第二章　在路上","CHAPTER II ON THE ROAD"
"当詹姆斯·斯塔尔收到跟第一封信相矛盾的这第二封信时，他的那些念头陡然间止住了。","The course of James Starr’s ideas was abruptly stopped, when he got this second letter contradicting the first."
"“这是什么意思？”他自言自语道。他拿起撕开的信封检查起来。和另一封信一样，这封信也盖着阿伯福伊尔的邮戳。所以，信是从斯特林郡的同一个地方寄出的。显然信不是老矿工写的。但同样明显的是，这第二封信的作者知道工头的秘密，因为第二封信的内容明显与第一封信邀请工程师前往亚罗井相矛盾。","“What does this mean?”said he to himself.He took up the torn envelope, and examined it.Like the other, it bore the Aberfoyle postmark.It had therefore come from the same part of the county of Stirling.The old miner had evidently not written it.But, no less evidently, the author of this second letter knew the overman’s secret, since it expressly contradicted the invitation to the engineer to go to the Yarrow shaft."
"第一则信息现在真的没有意义了吗？是有人想阻止詹姆斯·斯塔尔为无谓的事劳心费神，还是另有所图？会不会是出于要阻碍福特计划的险恶意图呢？","Was it really true that the first communication was now without object?Did someone wish to prevent James Starr from troubling himself either uselessly or otherwise?Might there not be rather a malevolent intention to thwart Ford’s plans?"
"这是詹姆斯·斯塔尔深思熟虑后得出的结论。这两封信的矛盾之处不料却激发了他，他更渴望前去多查特矿了。再说，如果这归根到底只是场骗局，那也值得去证实一下。斯塔尔还认为，选择相信第一封信比相信第二封更加明智；换言之，相信西蒙·福特这个人的邀请比相信匿名反驳者的警告要更为明智。","This was the conclusion at which James Starr arrived, after mature reflection.The contradiction which existed between the two letters only wrought in him a more keen desire to visit the Dochart pit.And besides, if after all it was a hoax, it was well worth while to prove it.Starr also thought it wiser to give more credence to the first letter than to the second; that is to say, to the request of such a man as Simon Ford, rather than to the warning of his anonymous contradictor."
"“事实上，”他说道，“有人竭力想左右我的决定，这正表明了福特的信息一定很重要。明天，我一定会按照约定的时间赴约。”","“Indeed,” said he, “the fact of anyone endeavoring to influence my resolution, shows that Ford’s communication must be of great importance.To-morrow, at the appointed time, I shall be at the rendezvous.”"
"晚上，斯塔尔做好了出发的准备。由于他此行可能会耽搁几天，他便写信告知皇家科学研究所的主席W. 埃尔菲斯顿爵士，他将无法出席协会的下一次会议。他还写信推掉了这周早已定好的两三个约会。随后，他吩咐他的仆人打包旅行袋，然后便上了床。他很兴奋，兴奋程度可能更甚于这件事原本应给人带来的激动。","In the evening, Starr made his preparations for departure.As it might happen that his absence would be prolonged for some days, he wrote to Sir W. Elphiston, president of the Royal Institution, that he should be unable to be present at the next meeting of the Society. He also wrote to excuse himself from two or three engagements which he had made for the week.Then, having ordered his servant to pack a traveling bag, he went to bed, more excited than the affair perhaps warranted."
"翌日五点，詹姆斯·斯塔尔跳下床；由于正下着冷雨，他穿得暖暖的，然后离开了他在坎农格特的家，前往格兰顿码头搭乘轮船。轮船会在三小时后把他从福斯送到斯特林。","The next day, at five o’clock, James Starr jumped out of bed, dressed himself warmly, for a cold rain was falling, and left his house in the Canongate, to go to Granton Pier to catch the steamer, which in three hours would take him up the Forth as far as Stirling."
"也许这是他人生中第一次在经过坎农格特时没有回头瞧瞧霍利鲁德宫——这座苏格兰前任统治者的宫殿。他没有注意到那些站在宫殿门口的哨兵，他们身着苏格兰高地兵团制服——苏格兰格呢短褶裙、毛呢长披肩，还有系于短裙前的毛皮袋。他满脑子想的都是即将要到达卡伦德，哈里·福特应该正在那儿恭候着他。","For the first time in his life, perhaps, in passing along the Canongate, he did not turn to look at Holyrood, the palace of the former sovereigns of Scotland.He did not notice the sentinels who stood before its gateways, dressed in the uniform of their Highland regiment, tartan kilt, plaid and sporran complete.His whole thought was to reach Callander where Harry Ford was supposedly awaiting him."
"为了更好地理解这个故事，我们不妨来听听煤的起源。在地质时期，地球椭球体仍在形成的过程之中，厚厚的大气层包围着它，大气层中充满了水蒸汽，并富含碳酸。蒸汽逐渐冷凝形成洪积似的暴雨，暴雨就像是从成千上万的碳酸水瓶瓶颈中喷洒出来的那样倾泻而下。这种富含碳酸的液体汇成湍流，流过深层的软土，使得软土形态或突然或缓慢地发生了变化；由于同时受到地球内部热量和太阳热量的影响，而这两种热量的影响又势均力敌，它始终保持着半流体的形态。然而，地球内部的热量从未被积聚到地心。地壳稀薄且未完全变硬，热量得以从其中的孔隙中散发出来。这样就形成了一种奇特的植被形态，就像在金星或水星那些内行星的表层形成的植被形态一样。在我们的星系中，这些内行星绕发光的太阳运行，比地球距离太阳更近。","The better to understand this narrative, it will be as well to hear a few words on the origin of coal.During the geological epoch, when the terrestrial spheroid was still in course of formation, a thick atmosphere surrounded it, saturated with watery vapors, and copiously impregnated with carbonic acid.The vapors gradually condensed in diluvial rains, which fell as if they had leapt from the necks of thousands of millions of seltzer water bottles.This liquid, loaded with carbonic acid, rushed in torrents over a deep soft soil, subject to sudden or slow alterations of form, and maintained in its semi-fluid state as much by the heat of the sun as by the fires of the interior mass.The internal heat had not as yet been collected in the center of the globe.The terrestrial crust, thin and incompletely hardened, allowed it to spread through its pores.This caused a peculiar form of vegetation, such as is probably produced on the surface of the inferior planets, Venus or Mercury, which revolve nearer than our earth around the radiant sun of our system."
"陆地的土壤上覆盖着广阔的森林。十分适合植物王国发展壮大的碳酸大量存在着。这些树的树根淹没在一种巨大的咸水湖里；淡水或咸水不断注入湖里，使湖水总是满满的。它们一点一点地从大气中析出碳元素，并急切地吸收，尽管碳元素并不适宜生命的运行；或者可以这么说，它们注定了要在地球深处以煤的形态储存碳元素。","The soil of the continents was covered with immense forests.Carbonic acid, so suitable for the development of the vegetable kingdom, abounded.The feet of these trees were drowned in a sort of immense lagoon, kept continually full by currents of fresh and salt waters.They eagerly assimilated to themselves the carbon which they, little by little, extracted from the atmosphere, as yet unfit for the function of life, and it may be said that they were destined to store it, in the form of coal, in the very bowels of the earth."
"那时是地震周期，地球内部的波动引起地震，而地震又会突然间改变尚不稳定的地表特征。这里隆起变成了高山，那里陷落形成了深渊，又被填为大洋或大海。在那里，整片森林下陷，穿过地壳落到不稳定的地层之下。它们找到一个可依托之所之后，如花岗岩构成的原始岩床，方才停止下陷；或者，它们聚成一堆，形成一块固体。","It was the earthquake period, caused by internal convulsions, which suddenly modified the unsettled features of the terrestrial surface.Here, an intumescence which was to become a mountain, there, an abyss which was to be filled with an ocean or a sea.There, whole forests sunk through the earth’s crust, below the unfixed strata, either until they found a resting-place, such as the primitive bed of granitic rock, or, settling together in a heap, they formed a solid mass."
"就像水流不会停留在河床，而是流向地球各处一样，它们也冲向想去的地方，同时还从几乎没有成形的岩石上扯走形成片岩、砂岩以及石灰岩的材质。这些流动的材质载着下陷后现已富含泥煤的森林移动，并在它们上面沉淀，形成覆于煤层之上的岩石成分。最终，历经数百万年的岁月，这些土壤层层变硬，把整片森林封闭在由圆砾岩、片岩、致密或易碎的砂岩、砂砾以及石块所构成的厚实外壳之下。","As the waters were contained in no bed, and were spread over every part of the globe, they rushed where they liked, tearing from the scarcely-formed rocks material with which to compose schists, sandstones, and limestones.This the roving waves bore over the submerged and now peaty forests, and deposited above them the elements of rocks which were to superpose the coal strata.In course of time, periods of which include millions of years, these earths hardened in layers, and enclosed under a thick carapace of pudding-stone, schist, compact or friable sandstone, gravel and stones, the whole of the massive forests."
"所有的植物材料都积聚起来，沉降在不同深处。在这个巨大的熔炉里上演着什么呢？一项常规的化学操作，一种蒸馏作用。这些植物里所含的碳全都已经聚集成块，在巨大的压力和地球内部热量产生的高温的双重作用下，煤开始一点一点地形成，在当时已经非常接近煤的形态。","And what went on in this gigantic crucible, where all this vegetable matter had accumulated, sunk to various depths?A regular chemical operation, a sort of distillation.All the carbon contained in these vegetables had agglomerated, and little by little coal was forming under the double influence of enormous pressure and the high temperature maintained by the internal fires, at this time so close to it."
"就在这种缓慢但无法抑制的反应中，一个王国取代了另一个王国。植物转变成了矿物。各种植物最初均以充满活力的植物生命形态存在，而今都被石化了。一些物质被封闭在这本巨大的草本植物志中，在其他矿化速度更快的物质上留下了它们的痕迹，就像是有一种无法估量的液压作用在其之上。","Thus there was one kingdom substituted for another in this slow but irresistible reaction.The vegetable was transformed into a mineral.Plants which had lived the vegetative life in all the vigor of first creation became petrified.Some of the substances enclosed in this vast herbal left their impression on the other more rapidly mineralized products, which pressed them as an hydraulic press of incalculable power would have done."
"这样，同样被水带走的贝壳、植物状的海洋动物、海星、水螅体、石燕，甚至鱼和蜥蜴，也在尚还柔软的煤上留下了它们清晰的印模，“令人惊叹的痕迹”。","Thus also shells, zoophytes, star-fish, polypi, spirifores, even fish and lizards brought by the water, left on the yet soft coal their exact likeness, “admirably taken off.”"
"在含碳层的形成过程中，压力似乎起着至关重要的作用。事实上，在不同的压力程度下会产生工业中所使用的不同种类的煤。这样，在最底层煤床里出产的是无烟煤，这种煤几乎已不含易挥发的物质，且含碳量最高。与之相反，在较高层的煤床里挖掘出的是褐煤和木化石，这些物质的含碳量极低。在这两个煤床之间，根据它们所受到的不同压力程度，会挖掘出石墨矿脉以及肥煤或贫煤。或许可以断言，由于缺少足够的压力，富含泥煤的沼层并没有完全转变成煤。所以，在地球上任何地方发现的煤矿，它的起源都是如此：地质时期大片森林陷入到地壳之下；然后，受到压力和热量的影响，并在碳酸的作用之下，植物最终得以在此时期矿化。","Pressure seems to have played a considerable part in the formation of carboniferous strata.In fact, it is to its degree of power that are due the different sorts of coal, of which industry makes use.Thus in the lowest layers of the coal ground appears the anthracite, which, being almost destitute of volatile matter, contains the greatest quantity of carbon.In the higher beds are found, on the contrary, lignite and fossil wood, substances in which the quantity of carbon is infinitely less.Between these two beds, according to the degree of pressure to which they have been subjected, are found veins of graphite and rich or poor coal.It may be asserted that it is for want of sufficient pressure that beds of peaty bog have not been completely changed into coal.So then, the origin of coal mines, in whatever part of the globe they have been discovered, is this: the absorption through the terrestrial crust of the great forests of the geological period; then, the mineralization of the vegetables obtained in the course of time, under the influence of pressure and heat, and under the action of carbonic acid."
"如今，在这个故事所发生的年代，苏格兰煤床中一些最重要的煤矿早已因过快的开采而枯竭了。阿伯福伊尔煤矿就位于从爱丁堡延伸至格拉斯哥的这片土地之下，绵延十到十二英里。工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔曾有很长一段时间在这里指导工程。这些煤矿已经被遗弃了十年。尽管探测已经进行到地下1500英尺的地方，甚至深入到2000英尺之处，人们也未曾发现任何新煤层，在詹姆斯·斯塔尔离任时，他确信纵使是最小的矿脉也已完全枯竭了。","Now, at the time when the events related in this story took place, some of the most important mines of the Scottish coal beds had been exhausted by too rapid working.In the region which extends between Edinburgh and Glasgow, for a distance of ten or twelve miles, lay the Aberfoyle colliery, of which the engineer, James Starr, had so long directed the works.For ten years these mines had been abandoned.No new seams had been discovered, although the soundings had been carried to a depth of fifteen hundred or even of two thousand feet, and when James Starr had retired, it was with the full conviction that even the smallest vein had been completely exhausted."
"在这种情况下，发现新煤层将会是一个非常重要的大事件，这一点显而易见。西蒙·福特的消息有可能是关于这个的吗？詹姆斯·斯塔尔不停地问自己这个问题。他是被召唤来征服这片富饶宝地上的另一个角落的吗？若是这样，他将十分乐意。","Under these circumstances, it was plain that the discovery of a new seam of coal would be an important event.Could Simon Ford’s communication relate to a fact of this nature?This question James Starr could not cease asking himself.Was he called to make conquest of another corner of these rich treasure fields?Fain would he hope it was so."
"第二封信曾一度引发他对这个问题的猜测，但现在，他不再考虑那封信了。而且，老工头的儿子在约定好的地点恭候着他。所以，那封匿名信再没有任何价值了。","The second letter had for an instant checked his speculations on this subject, but now he thought of that letter no longer.Besides, the son of the old overman was there, waiting at the appointed rendezvous.The anonymous letter was therefore worth nothing."
"当工程师到达了旅程终点，踏上码头时，那个年轻人便向他走来。","The moment the engineer set foot on the platform at the end of his journey, the young man advanced towards him."
"“你是哈里·福特吗？”工程师急忙问道。","“Are you Harry Ford?” asked the engineer quickly."
"“是的，斯塔尔先生。”","“Yes, Mr. Starr.”"
"“我都该认不出你了，我的孩子。当然了，十年里你都长成一个大人了！”","“I should not have known you, my lad.Of course in ten years you have become a man!”"
"“我立即就认出了您，先生，”年轻的矿工手里拿着一顶帽子，回答道，“您都没变。您看上去和我们在多查特矿井分别时一样。我忘不了那一天。”","“I knew you directly, sir,” replied the young miner, cap in hand.“You have not changed.You look just as you did when you bade us good-by in the Dochart pit.I haven’t forgotten that day.”"
"“戴上你的帽子，哈里，”工程师说道，“雨下得很大，不用为了讲礼貌而把自己弄感冒了。”","“Put on your cap, Harry,” said the engineer.“It’s pouring, and politeness needn't make you catch cold.”"
"“斯塔尔先生，我们要找个地方避避雨吗？”年轻的福特问道。","“Shall we take shelter anywhere, Mr. Starr?” asked young Ford."
"“不用了，哈里。天气会持续这样的。雨会下一整天，而我很心急。我们上路吧。”","“No, Harry.The weather is settled.It will rain all day, and I am in a hurry.Let us go on.”"
"“听从您的吩咐。”哈里回答道。","“I am at your orders,” replied Harry."
"“告诉我，哈里，你父亲好吗？”","“Tell me, Harry, is your father well?”"
"“很好，斯塔尔先生。”","“Very well, Mr. Starr.”"
"“那你母亲呢？”","“And your mother?”"
"“她也很好。”","“She is well, too.”"
"“是你父亲写信让我前往亚罗井的吗？”","“Was it your father who wrote telling me to come to the Yarrow shaft?”"
"“不是，信是我写的。”","“No, it was I.”"
"“那西蒙·福特有没有寄给我一封内容跟第一封信相矛盾的信？”工程师急忙问道。","“Then did Simon Ford send me a second letter to contradict the first?” asked the engineer quickly."
"“没有，斯塔尔先生。”年轻的矿工回答道。","“No, Mr. Starr,” answered the young miner."
"“很好。”斯塔尔说道，没再提及那封匿名信。随后，他继续问道：“你能否告诉我，你父亲让我来是想要我干什么？”","“Very well,” said Starr, without speaking of the anonymous letter.Then, continuing, “And can you tell me what you father wants with me?”"
"“斯塔尔先生，我父亲想亲自告诉您。”","“Mr. Starr, my father wishes to tell you himself.”"
"“但是，你知道是怎么回事吧？”","“But you know what it is?”"
"“我知道，先生。”","“I do, sir.”"
"“好吧，哈里，我不再多问了。那我们上路吧，我等不及要见见西蒙·福特了。顺便问问，他现在住在哪儿？”","“Well, Harry, I will not ask you more.But let us get on, for I’m anxious to see Simon Ford.By-the-bye, where does he live?”"
"“住在煤矿里。”","“In the mine.”"
"“什么！住在多查特矿井里？”","“What! In the Dochart pit?”"
"“是的，斯塔尔先生。”哈里回答道。","“Yes, Mr. Starr,” replied Harry."
"“真的啊！工程结束后，你们一家就从未离开过老煤矿吗？”","“Really! has your family never left the old mine since the cessation of the works?”"
"“一天也没有离开过，斯塔尔先生。您了解我的父亲。他在那里出生，也打算在那里死去！”","“Not a day, Mr. Starr.You know my father.It is there he was born, it is there he means to die!”"
"“我能理解，哈里。我能理解！那煤矿是他出生长大的地方啊！他不愿遗弃它！你们住在那儿快乐吗？”","“I can understand that, Harry.I can understand that!His native mine!He did not like to abandon it!And are you happy there?”"
"“是的，斯塔尔先生，”年轻的矿工回答道，“因为我们彼此爱护，并且我们的需求极少。”","“Yes, Mr. Starr,” replied the young miner, “for we love one another, and we have but few wants.”"
"“好吧，哈里，”工程师说道，“带路吧。”","“Well, Harry,” said the engineer, “lead the way.”"
"他们快速走过卡伦德的街道，几分钟后已把城镇留在了身后。","And walking rapidly through the streets of Callander, in a few minutes they had left the town behind them."
"第三章　多查特矿井","CHAPTER III THE DOCHART PIT"
"哈里·福特今年二十五岁，是个高大健壮的小伙子。因为他相貌看起来有些严肃，表情一贯冷漠，所以自他孩提时起，就极易从矿里的同伴中被认出来。他五官端正，一双深蓝色的眼睛，一头卷发呈栗色而非金色，有一种与生俱来的优雅气质，所有这些使他成为低地人的优秀代表。由于很早便习惯了在煤矿里工作，他强壮坚毅，且勇敢善良。在父亲的引导下，在他自身意愿的驱动下，他很早便开始了学习。在多数孩子尚处在学徒阶段时，他已使自己成为了一个重要人物，确切地说，已成为同伴中的领导者，而在这个竭力消除无知的地方，极少有人是十分无知的。尽管在青年时期的头些年里，哈里一直在挥镐劳动，但这个年轻的矿工从未耽搁过学习——充分学习知识，以使自己跻身矿工高层。如果煤矿不曾遭到遗弃，他必定会接替他父亲成为多查特矿井的工头。","Harry Ford was a fine, strapping fellow of five and twenty.His grave looks, his habitually passive expression, had from childhood been noticed among his comrades in the mine.His regular features, his deep blue eyes, his curly hair, rather chestnut than fair, the natural grace of his person, altogether made him a fine specimen of a lowlander.Accustomed from his earliest days to the work of the mine, he was strong and hardy, as well as brave and good.Guided by his father, and impelled by his own inclinations, he had early begun his education, and at an age when most lads are little more than apprentices, he had managed to make himself of some importance, a leader, in fact, among his fellows, and few are very ignorant in a country which does all it can to remove ignorance.Though, during the first years of his youth, the pick was never out of Harry’s hand, nevertheless the young miner was not long in acquiring sufficient knowledge to raise him into the upper class of the miners, and he would certainly have succeeded his father as overman of the Dochart pit, if the colliery had not been abandoned."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔依旧步伐矫健，但如果他的向导不曾放慢脚步的话，他是无法轻易追上向导的。年轻人拎着工程师的行李，沿着河流左岸行走了约一英里。而后他们走下蜿蜒的河岸，走上了另一条路，路旁种着高大的树木，这些树还在往下滴着露水。道路两旁是广阔的田地，周围零星散落着农场。在一块地里，一群无角的牛正静静地吃着草；另一块地里，一群羊在吃草，这些绵羊有着丝绸般柔滑的绒毛，就像儿童的羊栏玩具里的那些羊一样。","James Starr was still a good walker, yet he could not easily have kept up with his guide, if the latter had not slackened his pace.The young man, carrying the engineer’s bag, followed the left bank of the river for about a mile.Leaving its winding course, they took a road under tall, dripping trees.Wide fields lay on either side, around isolated farms.In one field a herd of hornless cows were quietly grazing; in another sheep with silky wool, like those in a child’s toy sheep fold."
"亚罗井距卡伦德四英里远。在行走过程中，詹姆斯·斯塔尔不禁被这个地方的变化所震撼。自从阿伯福伊尔最后一吨煤被装进火车，并被运至格拉斯哥后，他便再没见过这里了。如今，农耕生活已经取代了更加忙碌活跃的工业生活。因为冬季里田间的劳作都停止了，这反差就更明显了。但在从前，无论什么季节，地上和地下的矿工们使这个地方充满了生气。那时，铁路上的运煤大货车常常夜以继日地穿行着。铁路被货车的重量不断地碾压；如今，铁轨已被弃用，枕木也已腐烂。现在，石子路替代了昔日的采矿车轨。詹姆斯·斯塔尔感觉自己像在穿越一片沙漠。","The Yarrow shaft was situated four miles from Callander.Whilst walking, James Starr could not but be struck with the change in the country.He had not seen it since the day when the last ton of Aberfoyle coal had been emptied into railway trucks to be sent to Glasgow.Agricultural life had now taken the place of the more stirring, active, industrial life.The contrast was all the greater because, during winter, field work is at a standstill.But formerly, at whatever season, the mining population, above and below ground, filled the scene with animation.Great wagons of coal used to be passing night and day.The rails, with their rotten sleepers, now disused, were then constantly ground by the weight of wagons.Now stony roads took the place of the old mining tramways.James Starr felt as if he was traversing a desert."
"工程师满目伤感地凝视着周围。他不时地停下来歇口气。他聆听着。空气中不再充斥着远处的鸣笛声和引擎的振动声。再也没有生产者喜欢看到的那些黑色蒸汽，它们悬浮在跟云朵混成一团的地平线上。再也没有高耸的圆柱形或棱形烟囱在吸满煤烟后吐出烟雾；再也没有排气管吐出白色的蒸汽。从前满是黑色煤尘的地面，现在看上去闪亮光鲜，这在詹姆斯·斯塔尔看来很不习惯。","The engineer gazed about him with a saddened eye.He stopped now and then to take breath.He listened.The air was no longer filled with distant whistlings and the panting of engines.None of those black vapors which the manufacturer loves to see, hung in the horizon, mingling with the clouds.No tall cylindrical or prismatic chimney vomited out smoke, after being fed from the mine itself; no blast-pipe was puffing out its white vapor.The ground, formerly black with coal dust, had a bright look, to which James Starr’s eyes were not accustomed."
"当工程师站立不动时，哈里·福特也停了下来。这个年轻的矿工静静地等待着。他感觉到了同伴的脑中正在想些什么，而他也有同感。他是煤矿里的孩子，在煤矿深处度过一生。","When the engineer stood still, Harry Ford stopped also.The young miner waited in silence.He felt what was passing in his companion’s mind, and he shared his feelings; he, a child of the mine, whose whole life had been passed in its depths."
"“是的，哈里，一切都变了，”斯塔尔说道，“但以我们开采的进度，煤矿宝藏当然可能会在某天被采竭殆尽。你为那段时光感到惋惜吗？”","“Yes, Harry, it is all changed,” said Starr.“But at the rate we worked, of course the treasures of coal would have been exhausted some day.Do you regret that time?”"
"“我确实为之感到惋惜，斯塔尔先生。”哈里回答道，“工作很苦，但很有意思，就和所有的战斗一样。”","“I do regret it, Mr. Starr,” answered Harry.“The work was hard, but it was interesting, as are all struggles.”"
"“确实如此，我的孩子。一场持续不断的战斗，抗击着塌方、火灾、水淹以及雷声般的甲烷爆炸这些危险。人们必须防范所有那些危险！你说得对！这是一场战斗，所以这也是一段激动人心的生活。”","“No doubt, my lad.A continuous struggle against the dangers of landslips, fires, inundations, explosions of firedamp, like claps of thunder.One had to guard against all those perils!You say well!It was a struggle, and consequently an exciting life.”"
"“阿尔瓦的矿工比阿伯福伊尔的矿工更幸运，斯塔尔先生！”","“The miners of Alva have been more favored than the miners of Aberfoyle, Mr. Starr!”"
"“是啊，哈里，他们是更幸运。”工程师回答道。","“Ay, Harry, so they have,” replied the engineer."
"“确实，”年轻人叫道，“遗憾的是整个地球并不是全由煤构成的，不然，那大概就够开采好几百万年的了！”","“Indeed,” cried the young man, “it’s a pity that all the globe was not made of coal; then there would have been enough to last millions of years!”"
"“那是毋庸置疑的，哈里，但必须承认，大自然显示出它更有深谋远虑，它主要用砂岩、石灰岩以及花岗岩来构成我们的地球，这些材料都是火无法毁灭的。”","“No doubt there would, Harry; it must be acknowledged, however, that nature has shown more forethought by forming our sphere principally of sandstone, limestone, and granite, which fire cannot consume.”"
"“斯塔尔先生，您是想说人类会因焚毁自己的地球而灭亡吗？”","“Do you mean to say, Mr. Starr, that mankind would have ended by burning their own globe?”"
"“是的！彻底地灭亡，我的孩子，”工程师回答道，“地球将把自己的最后的一小块放进机车、机器、轮船、煤气厂的熔炉里；毫无疑问，那将是我们世界终结的那个好日子！”","“Yes!The whole of it, my lad,” answered the engineer.“The earth would have passed to the last bit into the furnaces of engines, machines, steamers, gas factories; certainly, that would have been the end of our world one fine day!”"
"“现在无需担心那个，斯塔尔先生。但是，煤矿会被采竭殆尽，这毫无疑问，并且会比统计数据所列出的进展还要快！”","“There is no fear of that now, Mr. Starr.But yet, the mines will be exhausted, no doubt, and more rapidly than the statistics make out!”"
"“那会发生的，哈里，在我看来，英国用她的燃料去换取其他国家的黄金是极其错误的！我很清楚，”工程师补充道，“无论是水力还是电能，都尚未被物尽其用,总有一天，这两种动力会得以更加充分地利用。但没关系！煤很实用，并容易适应于各种工业需要。遗憾的是，人类无法任意生产煤。虽然我们地表的森林在热量和水的作用下不断地生长，但地下的森林却不会再生；即使它们可以再生，地球的状态再也无法使它们转变为煤。”","“That will happen, Harry; and in my opinion England is very wrong in exchanging her fuel for the gold of other nations!I know well,” added the engineer, “that neither hydraulics nor electricity has yet shown all they can do, and that some day these two forces will be more completely utilized.But no matter!Coal is of a very practical use, and lends itself easily to the various wants of industry.Unfortunately man cannot produce it at will.Though our external forests grow incessantly under the influence of heat and water, our subterranean forests will not be reproduced, and if they were, the globe would never be in the state necessary to make them into coal.”"
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的向导一边说话，一边继续快步前行。在离开卡伦德一小时后，他们到达了多查特矿井。","James Starr and his guide, whilst talking, had continued their walk at a rapid pace.An hour after leaving Callander they reached the Dochart pit."
"最冷漠的人都会被这个荒废之处所呈现出的面貌所触动。它就像一具以前某种生物的骨架。几株枯败的树木围着一块平地，地面上曾覆盖着矿物燃料的黑色尘土，但现在再也看不到那些煤渣了，甚至连煤屑也看不到了。一切都在很久以前被运走了，被消耗了。","The most indifferent person would have been touched at the appearance this deserted spot presented.It was like the skeleton of something that had formerly lived.A few wretched trees bordered a plain where the ground was hidden under the black dust of the mineral fuel, but no cinders nor even fragments of coal were to be seen.All had been carried away and consumed long ago."
"他们走进遮盖住亚罗井井口的工棚，井口的梯子仍然通向矿井下层的水平巷道。工程师俯身进入井口。从前，在这个地方可以听见通风机抽气时强大的呼啸声。如今，这只是个寂静的深渊。它就像处在某个死火山的火山口一样。","They walked into the shed which covered the opening of the Yarrow shaft, whence ladders still gave access to the lower galleries of the pit.The engineer bent over the opening.Formerly from this place could be heard the powerful whistle of the air inhaled by the ventilators.It was now a silent abyss.It was like being at the mouth of some extinct volcano."
"在煤矿开采期间，阿伯福伊尔煤矿的某些矿井里就使用了精制的机器，在机械化程度方面非常出色。支架上安装了自动升降机，它们滑行在木制滑槽里，摆动着梯子，被称为“坑内升降机”；这种升降机通过一个简单的运动便可让矿工们安全下井。","When the mine was being worked, ingenious machines were used in certain shafts of the Aberfoyle colliery, which in this respect was very well off; frames furnished with automatic lifts, working in wooden slides, oscillating ladders, called “man-engines”, which, by a simple movement, permitted the miners to descend without danger."
"但在工程结束后，所有这些设备都已被运走了。在亚罗井里，只留下了一长串梯子，梯子每隔五十英尺就被狭窄的楼梯平台隔开。三十架这样的梯子以此方式首尾相连，引导参观者下到1500英尺深的下层水平巷道。这是多查特矿井底部和地面之间的惟一通道。至于空气，它是从亚罗井进入的，因为亚罗井的水平巷道连通着另一个井口开得较高的矿井，暖空气就通过这种倒置的虹吸管自然地散了出去。","But all these appliances had been carried away, after the cessation of the works.In the Yarrow shaft there remained only a long succession of ladders, separated at every fifty feet by narrow landings.Thirty of these ladders placed thus end to end led the visitor down into the lower gallery, a depth of fifteen hundred feet.This was the only way of communication which existed between the bottom of the Dochart pit and the open air.As to air, that came in by the Yarrow shaft, from whence galleries communicated with another shaft whose orifice opened at a higher level; the warm air naturally escaped by this species of inverted siphon."
"“我跟着你，我的孩子。”工程师说道，并示意年轻人先行。","“I will follow you, my lad,” said the engineer, signing to the young man to precede him."
"“随您的意思，斯塔尔先生。”“你带灯了吗？”","“As you please, Mr. Starr.”“Have you your lamp?”"
"“带了，我真希望它仍旧是我们从前必用的安全灯！”","“Yes, and I only wish it was still the safety lamp, which we formerly had to use!”"
"“的确，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，“现在不用担心甲烷爆炸了！”","“Sure enough,” returned James Starr, “there is no fear of fire-damp explosions now!”"
"哈里带了一盏简易的油灯，他点燃了灯芯。在煤矿里，煤如今已被挖空，较轻的碳化氢发生泄露的情况不会再出现了。因为不用担心爆炸，就无需在火焰与周围空气之间置入金属屏以防煤气被点燃。但如果危险不存在了，那是因为引发危险的因素已经消失了，而正是这个易燃因素的存在才造就了多查特矿井昔日的财富。","Harry was provided with a simple oil lamp, the wick of which he lighted.In the mine, now empty of coal, escapes of light carburetted hydrogen could not occur.As no explosion need be feared, there was no necessity for interposing between the flame and the surrounding air that metallic screen which prevents the gas from catching fire.The Davy lamp was of no use here.But if the danger did not exist, it was because the cause of it had disappeared, and with this cause, the combustible in which formerly consisted the riches of the Dochart pit."
"哈里走下了上面那架梯子的头几个台阶。斯塔尔跟在其后。他们立即发现自己身处一片漆黑之中，只有安全灯的微光能带来点光亮。年轻人把灯举过头顶，以便更好地为他的同伴照亮。工程师和他的向导用矿工所惯用的缓慢而匀称的步伐爬下了十二架梯子。这些梯子仍然很牢固。","Harry descended the first steps of the upper ladder.Starr followed.They soon found themselves in a profound obscurity, which was only relieved by the glimmer of the lamp.The young man held it above his head, the better to light his companion.A dozen ladders were descended by the engineer and his guide, with the measured step habitual to the miner.They were all still in good condition."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔借着微弱的灯光，检查了黑暗矿井的内壁，内壁上覆盖着一排开始腐烂的木头。","James Starr examined, as well as the insufficient light would permit,  the sides of the dark shaft, which were covered by a partly rotten lining of wood."
"当他们到达第十五个楼梯平台时，换言之，当下行了一半路程时，他们停留了几分钟。","Arrived at the fifteenth landing, that is to say, half way down, they halted for a few minutes."
"“显然，我的步伐不如你矫健，我的孩子。”工程师喘息道。","“Decidedly, I have not your legs, my lad,” said the engineer, panting."
"“您非常健壮，斯塔尔先生。”哈里回答道，“您知道，这也和一个人一辈子生活在矿里有关。”“不错，哈里。以前，在我二十岁时，我能一口气下到矿底。来吧，前进！”","“You are very stout, Mr. Starr,” replied Harry, “and it’s something too, you see, to live all one’s life in the mine.”“Right, Harry.Formerly, when I was twenty, I could have gone down all at a breath.Come, forward!”"
"但正当两人要离开平台时，他们听见了从井的深处传来的一个声音，虽然声音很遥远。声音犹如滚滚袭来的巨浪，越来越响亮，越来越清晰。","But just as the two were about to leave the platform, a voice, as yet far distant, was heard in the depths of the shaft.It came up like a sonorous billow, swelling as it advanced, and becoming more and more distinct."
"“嘿！谁到这儿来了？”工程师拦住哈里问道。","“Halloo! who comes here?” asked the engineer, stopping Harry."
"“我不清楚。”年轻的矿工回答道。","“I cannot say,” answered the young miner."
"“不会是你父亲吧？”","“Is it not your father?”"
"“我父亲，斯塔尔先生？不会的。”","“My father, Mr. Starr? no.”"
"“那某个邻居呢？”","“Some neighbor, then?”"
"“在矿井下我们没有邻居，”哈里回答道，“就只有我们，仅仅就只是我们。”","“We have no neighbors in the bottom of the pit,” replied Harry.“We are alone, quite alone.”"
"“好吧，我们必须给这个闯入者让道。”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“那些正在下井的人必须给那些正在往上走的人让道。”","“Well, we must let this intruder pass,” said James Starr.“Those who are descending must yield the path to those who are ascending.”"
"他们等待着。宏亮的声音突然再次响起，仿佛是经由一个巨大的传声筒传来的；没多久，一首苏格兰歌曲的几句歌词清楚地传入了年轻矿工的耳中。","They waited.The voice broke out again with a magnificent burst, as if it had been carried through a vast speaking trumpet; and soon a few words of a Scotch song came clearly to the ears of the young miner."
"“百名风笛手！”哈里叫道，“噢，如果这不是从杰克·瑞安肺里发出来的歌声，我该会感到非常惊讶。”","“The Hundred Pipers!” cried Harry.“Well, I shall be much surprised if that comes from the lungs of any man but Jack Ryan.”"
"“这个杰克·瑞安是谁？”詹姆斯·斯塔尔问道。","“And who is this Jack Ryan?” asked James Starr."
"“一个昔日的采矿同伴。”哈里回答道。他随即俯在平台上，“嘿！杰克！”他叫道。","“An old mining comrade,” replied Harry.Then leaning from the platform, “Halloo! Jack!” he shouted."
"“是你吗，哈里？”那人答道，“等一等，我就来。”歌声再次响起。","“Is that you, Harry?” was the reply.“Wait a bit, I’m coming.”And the song broke forth again."
"几分钟后，提灯映照出了一个明亮的锥形，在其底部出现了一个身材高大的二十五岁小伙子；他有着一头浅棕色的头发，满脸喜悦，眼带笑意，高兴地咧着嘴，并爬上了第十五架梯子的楼梯平台。他的第一个动作便是用力握住了哈里·福特伸出的手。","In a few minutes, a tall fellow of five and twenty, with a merry face, smiling eyes, a laughing mouth, and sandy hair, appeared at the bottom of the luminous cone which was thrown from his lantern, and set foot on the landing of the fifteenth ladder.His first act was to vigorously wring the hand which Harry extended to him."
"“真高兴碰到你！”他叫道，“要是我知道你今天会在地上，那我就不必下到亚罗井了！”","“Delighted to meet you!” he exclaimed.“If I had only known you were to be above ground today, I would have spared myself going down the Yarrow shaft!”"
"“这是詹姆斯·斯塔尔先生，”哈里边说边把灯转向站在阴影里的工程师。","“This is Mr. James Starr,” said Harry, turning his lamp towards the engineer, who was in the shadow."
"“斯塔尔先生！”杰克·瑞安叫道，“啊，先生，我都没看见您。自从我离开煤矿后，我的眼睛就不再像以前那样习惯在黑暗里看东西了。”","“Mr. Starr!” cried Jack Ryan.“Ah, sir, I could not see.Since I left the mine, my eyes have not been accustomed to see in the dark, as they used to do.”"
"“哦，我记得有个总是唱歌的小伙子。那是十年前了。肯定就是你吧？”","“Ah, I remember a laddie who was always singing.That was ten years ago.It was you, no doubt?”"
"“啊，斯塔尔先生，虽然我的职业变了，但我的性情却没变。欢笑和歌唱远好过哭泣和哀鸣！”","“Ay, Mr. Starr, but in changing my trade, I haven't changed my disposition.It’s far better to laugh and sing than to cry and whine!”"
"“你说得对，杰克·瑞安。离开煤矿后，你现在干些什么呢？”","“You’re right there, Jack Ryan.And what do you do now, as you have left the mine?”"
"“我在离这儿四十英里的梅尔罗斯农场干活。哎，它不像我们的阿伯福伊尔煤矿！和铁锹和锄头比起来，还是镐在我手中更好使。那时在老矿井里，拱形屋顶回荡着人们的愉快的歌声，而在地上——您是去见老西蒙吧，斯塔尔先生？”","“I am working on the Melrose farm, forty miles from here.Ah, it’s not like our Aberfoyle mines!The pick comes better to my hand than the spade or hoe.And then, in the old pit, there were vaulted roofs, to merrily echo one’s songs, while up above ground!—But you are going to see old Simon, Mr. Starr?”"
"“是的，杰克。”工程师回答道。","“Yes, Jack,” answered the engineer."
"“那别让我耽误了您。”","“Don’t let me keep you then.”"
"“告诉我，杰克，”哈里说道，“你今天来我们村舍是为何事？”","“Tell me, Jack,” said Harry, “what was taking you to our cottage today?”"
"“我想见见你，伙计，”杰克回答道，“并邀你参加在欧文举行的活动。你知道我是当地的风笛手。活动还包括跳舞和唱歌。”","“I wanted to see you, man,” replied Jack, “and ask you to come to the Irvine games.You know I am the piper of the place.There will be dancing and singing.”"
"“谢谢你，杰克，但是不行。”","“Thank you, Jack, but it’s impossible.”"
"“不行？”","“Impossible?”"
"“是的，斯塔尔先生在这里会呆上一段时日，我必须送他回卡伦德。”","“Yes; Mr. Starr’s visit will last some time, and I must take him back to Callander.”"
"“行了，哈里，这都不到一星期。我想那时斯塔尔先生也要回去了，你家里也没什么事要你打理了。”","“Well, Harry, it won’t be for a week yet.By that time Mr. Starr’s visit will be over, I should think, and there will be nothing to keep you at the cottage.”"
"“的确，哈里，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“你准能从你朋友杰克的邀请中得益的。”","“Indeed, Harry,” said James Starr, “you must profit by your friend Jack’s invitation.”"
"“好吧，我接受邀请，杰克。”哈里说道，“一星期后我们在欧文见。”","“Well, I accept it, Jack,” said Harry.“In a week we will meet at Irvine.”"
"“一星期后见，就这么定了。”瑞安回答道，“再见，哈里！向您致敬，斯塔尔先生。我很高兴能再次见到您！我会将见到您的消息告诉我所有的朋友。没人忘记您，先生。”","“In a week, that’s settled,” returned Ryan.“Good-by, Harry!Your servant, Mr. Starr.I am very glad to have seen you again!I can give news of you to all my friends.No one has forgotten you, sir.”"
"“我也没有忘了任何人。”斯塔尔说道。","“And I have forgotten no one,” said Starr."
"“非常感谢，先生。”杰克回道。","“Thanks for all, sir,” replied Jack."
"“再见，杰克。”哈里握着他的手说道。杰克·瑞安唱着歌离开了，很快便消失在矿井高处，那儿被他的灯光映照得模糊昏暗。","“Good-by, Jack,” said Harry, shaking his hand.And Jack Ryan, singing as he went, soon disappeared in the heights of the shaft, dimly lighted by his lamp."
"一刻钟之后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔和哈里爬下最后一架梯子，站在了矿井的最底层。","A quarter of an hour afterwards James Starr and Harry descended the last ladder, and set foot on the lowest floor of the pit."
"许多空旷的水平巷道从亚罗井井底向四周延伸。它们穿过片岩和砂岩的岩壁，其中一些靠劈得参差不齐的梁木支撑着，另一些则沿着厚厚的木制防护层排列着。四周都有护堤填补那些被挖空的矿脉。如今支撑地面的柱子是用邻近采石场的石头人工打造而成的；换言之，从前靠煤层自身依托的第三层和第四层这两层土地如今却由这些柱子支撑着。如今，水平巷道里一片黑暗，从前这里要么是被矿工的灯所照亮，要么是被电灯所照亮；电灯当时已被引进到煤矿里使用了。","From the bottom of the Yarrow shaft radiated numerous empty galleries.They ran through the wall of schist and sandstone, some shored up with great, roughly-hewn beams, others lined with a thick casing of wood.In every direction embankments supplied the place of the excavated veins.Artificial pillars were made of stone from neighboring quarries, and now they supported the ground, that is to say, the double layer of tertiary and quaternary soil, which formerly rested on the seam itself.Darkness now filled the galleries, formerly lighted either by the miner’s lamp or by the electric light, the use of which had been introduced in the mines."
"“您不需要休息一下吗，斯塔尔先生？”年轻人问道。","“Will you not rest a while, Mr. Starr?” asked the young man."
"“不用，我的孩子，”工程师回答道，“我急着去你父亲的村舍。”","“No, my lad,” replied the engineer, “for I am anxious to be at your father’s cottage.”"
"“那您跟着我，斯塔尔先生。我会为您带路，但我相信您完全能在这黑暗的迷宫中找到您的路。”","“Follow me then, Mr. Starr.I will guide you, and yet I daresay you could find your way perfectly well through this dark labyrinth.”"
"“是的，的确！老煤矿的整个平面图仍然在我脑子里。”","“Yes, indeed!I have the whole plan of the old pit still in my head.”"
"哈里走在工程师前面带路，他将手中的灯举得高高的，以便更好地照亮路途。他们沿着一个高高的水平巷道行走，那里就像是一个大教堂的中殿。他们的脚还是踢到了曾用来支撑铁轨的枕木。","Harry, followed by the engineer, and holding his lamp high the better to light their way, walked along a high gallery, like the nave of a cathedral.Their feet still struck against the wooden sleepers which used to support the rails."
"他们还没走到五十步，一块大石头就落在了詹姆斯·斯塔尔的脚下。“当心，斯塔尔先生！”哈里一边叫，一边抓住工程师的胳膊。","They had not gone more than fifty paces, when a huge stone fell at the feet of James Starr.“Take care, Mr. Starr!” cried Harry, seizing the engineer by the arm."
"“一块石头，哈里！哈！这些旧的拱形结构也不再那么牢固了，当然，而且——”","“A stone, Harry! Ah! these old vaultings are no longer quite secure, of course, and—” "
"“斯塔尔先生，”哈里·福特说道，“依我看，这石头好像是被扔过来的，是被人用手扔过来的！”","“Mr. Starr,” said Harry Ford, “it seems to me that stone was thrown, thrown as by the hand of man!”"
"“扔过来的！”詹姆斯·斯塔尔叫道，“你是什么意思，孩子？”","“Thrown!” exclaimed Jamed Starr.“What do you mean, lad?”"
"“没事，没事，斯塔尔先生，”哈里支支吾吾地答道，他焦虑的目光正试图穿透这片黑暗。“我们继续走吧。请抓着我的胳膊，先生，不用担心会走错路。”","“Nothing, nothing, Mr. Starr,” replied Harry evasively, his anxious gaze endeavoring to pierce the darkness.“Let us go on.Take my arm, sir, and don't be afraid of making a false step.”"
"“我来了，哈里。”他们一起前行，与此同时，哈里一边观察着四周，一边把灯光照向水平巷道的每一个角落。","“Here I am, Harry.”And they both advanced, whilst Harry looked on every side, throwing the light of his lamp into all the corners of the gallery."
"“我们马上就能到那儿了吗？”工程师问道。 ","“Shall we soon be there?” asked the engineer."
"“最多十分钟。”","“In ten minutes at most.”"
"“很好。”","“Good.”"
"“但是，”哈里咕哝道，“这件事非常奇怪。这样的事是第一次发生在我身上。那块石头在我们正要经过时就落下来了。”","“But,” muttered Harry, “that was a most singular thing.It is the first time such an accident has happened to me.That stone falling just at the moment we were passing.”"
"“哈里，那纯粹是个巧合。”","“Harry, it was a mere chance.”"
"“巧合，”年轻人摇着头回答道。“是啊，巧合。”他停下来留心听着。","“Chance,” replied the young man, shaking his head.“Yes, chance.”He stopped and listened."
"“怎么了，哈里？”工程师问道。","“What is the matter, Harry?” asked the engineer."
"“我想我听到有人跟在我们后面。”年轻的矿工一面回答，一面更专注地听着。随后他补充道，“不是，我准是听错了。请再靠我的胳膊近些，斯塔尔先生。就拿我当一根拐杖使。”","“I thought I heard someone walking behind us,” replied the young miner, listening more attentively.Then he added, “No, I must have been mistaken.Lean harder on my arm, Mr. Starr.Use me like a staff.”"
"“一根很结实的拐杖，哈里，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，“我再也想不出比你更棒的好小伙了。”","“A good solid staff, Harry,” answered James Starr.“I could not wish for a better than a fine fellow like you.”"
"他们继续沿着黑暗的中殿静静地前行。哈里显然有心事，常常回头，试图去弄明白远处的某个声响，或是远处的一缕微光。","They continued in silence along the dark nave.Harry was evidently preoccupied, and frequently turned, trying to catch, either some distant noise, or remote glimmer of light."
"但他的身前身后全是寂静和黑暗。","But behind and before, all was silence and darkness."
"第四章 福特一家","CHAPTER IV THE FORD FAMILY"
"十分钟后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔和哈里从主水平巷道中出来了。现在他们正站在一块空地中——如果我们可以用这个词来指代一个巨大而黑暗的洞穴的话。然而，这个地方并非完全没有日光。几缕光线通过一个废井的井口散射进来。多查特矿井正是通过这个管道来通风的。暖空气由于密度较低而被吸入亚罗井。因此，空气和光线多多少少地渗入到这片空地上来。","Ten minutes afterwards, James Starr and Harry issued from the principal gallery.They were now standing in a glade, if we may use this word to designate a vast and dark excavation.The place, however, was not entirely deprived of daylight.A few rays straggled in through the opening of a deserted shaft.It was by means of this pipe that ventilation was established in the Dochart pit.Owing to its lesser density, the warm air was drawn towards the Yarrow shaft.Both air and light, therefore, penetrated in some measure into the glade."
"在这儿，西蒙·福特和他的家人已经住了十年。这处地下住所是从片岩堆中挖出来的；那儿从前放置着功率强大的引擎，多查特矿井机械牵引的工作便由它们来完成。","Here Simon Ford had lived with his family ten years, in a subterranean dwelling, hollowed out in the schistous mass, where formerly stood the powerful engines which worked the mechanical traction of the Dochart pit."
"老工头就住在这样一个被他称之为“他的村舍”的居所里。福特一生辛勤工作，积攒了一些财富，他本可以生活在阳光下、林木间，或是这个王国里任由他选择的任何城镇上，但是他和他的妻儿宁可留在煤矿里；他们在那儿生活得很幸福，有着共同的观念、想法和兴趣。　的确，他们非常喜爱他们这个埋在苏格兰地下1500英尺处的村舍。在众多好处中，其中一项就是无需担忧收税员或收租员会来打扰这儿的居民。","Such was the habitation, “his cottage,” as he called it, in which resided the old overman.As he had some means saved during a long life of toil, Ford could have afforded to live in the light of day, among trees, or in any town of the kingdom he chose, but he and his wife and son preferred remaining in the mine, where they were happy together, having the same opinions, ideas, and tastes.Yes, they were quite fond of their cottage, buried fifteen hundred feet below Scottish soil.Among other advantages, there was no fear that tax gatherers, or rent collectors would ever come to trouble its inhabitants."
"多查特矿井的前任工头西蒙·福特这时已六十五岁了，身板还很硬朗。他高大、健壮、身材匀称，本该被认为是当地最出众的男人之一。这个地方为高地兵团输送了许多好小伙。","At this period, Simon Ford, the former overman of the Dochart pit, bore the weight of sixty-five years well.Tall, robust, well-built, he would have been regarded as one of the most conspicuous men in the district which supplies so many fine fellows to the Highland regiments."
"西蒙·福特出生于一个老矿工家庭，他的祖先曾在苏格兰第一批被开采的石炭纪煤层工作。不用讨论希腊人和罗马人是否使用煤，中国人是否在基督纪元前已开始开采煤矿，法语中的“煤”（houille）一词是否真的得名于十二世纪比利时的蹄铁匠Houillos，我们可以断言的是，大不列颠的煤床是首次被人类有规律地进行开采的。早在十一世纪，征服者威廉就在他的战友中分配了纽卡斯尔煤床的产品。十三世纪末，亨利三世授予了“煤海”的开采许可证。最后，该世纪结束之时，又有人提到了苏格兰和威尔士的煤床。","Simon Ford was descended from an old mining family, and his ancestors had worked the very first carboniferous seams opened in Scotland.Without discussing whether or not the Greeks and Romans made use of coal, whether the Chinese worked coal mines before the Christian era, whether the French word for coal (houille) is really derived from the farrier Houillos, who lived in Belgium in the twelfth century, we may affirm that the beds in Great Britain were the first ever regularly worked.So early as the eleventh century, William the Conqueror divided the produce of the Newcastle bed among his companions-in-arms.At the end of the thirteenth century, a license for the mining of “sea coal” was granted by Henry III.Lastly, towards the end of the same century, mention is made of the Scotch and Welsh beds."
"大约在这个时期，西蒙·福特的祖先进入到古苏格兰的地下深处，此后祖祖辈辈一直生活在那儿。他们只是普通的矿工。他们像服刑犯一样劳动，挖掘出珍贵的燃料。人们甚至认为，煤矿工人就像那个时期的制盐工一样，实际上就是奴隶。","It was about this time that Simon Ford’s ancestors penetrated into the bowels of Caledonian earth, and lived there ever after, from father to son.They were but plain miners.They labored like convicts at the work of extracting the precious combustible.It is even believed that the coal miners, like the salt-makers of that period, were actual slaves."
"无论怎样，西蒙·福特都为自己属于这个古老的苏格兰矿工家庭而感到骄傲。他在这里努力地工作，就在这同一个地方，他的祖先们也曾挥动着镐、铁撬以及鹤嘴锄。他在三十岁时当上了多查特矿井的工头，那是阿伯福伊尔煤矿里最重要的矿井。他全身心地投入到他的职业中去。在漫长的年月里，他积极地履行他的职责。他仅有的悲痛便是意识到煤床变得贫瘠、目睹着煤层枯竭的时刻渐渐临近。","However that might have been, Simon Ford was proud of belonging to this ancient family of Scotch miners.He had worked diligently in the same place where his ancestors had wielded the pick, the crowbar, and the mattock.At thirty he was overman of the Dochart pit, the most important in the Aberfoyle colliery.He was devoted to his trade.During long years he zealously performed his duty.His only grief had been to perceive the bed becoming impoverished, and to see the hour approaching when the seam would be exhausted."
"随后，他在阿伯福伊尔那些在地下彼此相连的矿井中竭力搜寻新矿脉。在工程的最后时期，他曾很幸运地发现过几处新矿脉。矿工的直觉给予了他极大的帮助，因此工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔非常赏识他。可以这么说，他在煤矿深处探寻煤层，就像深水探视仪在地球深处探测泉水那样。他是个极为优秀的矿工，他的全部生活都与其在矿里的生活密不可分。他从出生起就生活在那儿，如今虽然工程已结束了，他仍愿意生活在那儿。他的儿子哈里为地下生活的给养四处奔波；至于他自己，在那十年间，他上地面的次数不超过十次。","It was then he devoted himself to the search for new veins in all the Aberfoyle pits, which communicated underground one with another.He had had the good luck to discover several during the last period of the working.His miner’s instinct assisted him marvelously, and the engineer, James Starr, appreciated him highly.It might be said that he divined the course of seams in the depths of the coal mine as a hydroscope reveals springs in the bowels of the earth.He was par excellence the type of a miner whose whole existence is indissolubly connected with that of his mine.He had lived there from his birth, and now that the works were abandoned he wished to live there still.His son Harry foraged for the subterranean housekeeping; as for himself, during those ten years he had not been ten times above ground."
"“上那儿去！有什么好处？”他会这样说，并拒绝离开他的黑色领地。这个地方非常有利于健康，因为这里温度变化不大；老工头既不必忍受夏日的炎热，也无需忍受冬日的寒冷。他的家人身体很健康，他还能有什么要求呢？","“Go up there!What is the good?” he would say, and refused to leave his black domain.The place was remarkably healthy, subject to an equable temperature; the old overman endured neither the heat of summer nor the cold of winter.His family enjoyed good health; what more could he desire?"
"但他内心里感到沮丧。他想念从前的活力、活动，以及矿井运作良好时的矿下生活。然而，一个坚定的念头支撑着他。“不会的，不会的！煤矿是不会枯竭的！”他反复说道。","But at heart he felt depressed.He missed the former animation, movement, and life in the well-worked pit.He was, however, supported by one fixed idea.“No, no! the mine is not exhausted!” he repeated."
"如果有人敢在西蒙·福特面前对老阿伯福伊尔终有一天会复苏这点表达出任何质疑，那无疑会深深地冒犯他。他从未放弃发现某个新煤床的希望，这新煤床将使煤矿恢复昔日的辉煌。是的，如果有必要的话，他愿意重新拿起矿工的镐，用他那依然结实的胳膊使劲敲击岩石。他穿过黑暗的水平巷道，有时独自一人，有时和他的儿子一起，检查矿井，搜寻煤的踪迹，结果却是每天满身疲惫地回到村舍，但他并不绝望。","And that man would have given serious offense who could have ventured to express before Simon Ford any doubt that old Aberfoyle would one day revive!He had never given up the hope of discovering some new bed which would restore the mine to its past splendor.Yes, he would willingly, had it been necessary, have resumed the miner’s pick, and with his still stout arms vigorously attacked the rock.He went through the dark galleries, sometimes alone, sometimes with his son, examining, searching for signs of coal, only to return each day, wearied, but not in despair, to the cottage."
"马奇是西蒙的忠诚伴侣，用苏格兰话来说，是个“好妻子”；她高大、强壮且长相标致。马奇和她丈夫一样，不愿意离开多查特矿井。她和西蒙有着同样的希望和惋惜。她鼓励着他，督促着他，她说的话总是能够振奋老工头的心灵。“阿伯福伊尔只是在沉睡。”她会说，“关于这件事，你是对的，西蒙。这仅仅是休息，而不是死亡！”","Madge, Simon’s faithful companion, his “gude-wife”, to use the Scotch term, was a tall, strong, comely woman.Madge had no wish to leave the Dochart pit any more than had her husband.She shared all his hopes and regrets.She encouraged him, She urged him on, and talked to him in a way which cheered the heart of the old overman.“Aberfoyle is only asleep,” she would say.“You are right about that, Simon.This is but a rest, it is not death!”"
"马奇以及其他人非常满意这种与外界毫无联系的生活，这个小家庭在他们黑暗的村舍里享受着幸福，而她是这幸福的核心。他们急切地盼望着工程师的到来。西蒙·福特站在家门前，当哈里的灯告知他前任管理者的到来时，他便立即出迎。","Madge, as well as the others, was perfectly satisfied to live independent of the outer world, and was the center of the happiness enjoyed by the little family in their dark cottage.The engineer was eagerly expected.Simon Ford was standing at his door, and as soon as Harry’s lamp announced the arrival of his former viewer he advanced to meet him."
"“欢迎您，斯塔尔先生！”他大声说道，声音回荡在片岩洞顶下，“欢迎来到老工头的村舍！尽管我们家被埋在地下1500英尺处，但它仍是那样热情好客。”","“Welcome, Mr. Starr!” he exclaimed, his voice echoing under the roof of schist.“Welcome to the old overman’s cottage!Though it is buried fifteen hundred feet under the earth, our house is not the less hospitable.”"
"“您好吗，善良的西蒙？”詹姆斯·斯塔尔握住主人伸出的手问道。","“And how are you, good Simon?” asked James Starr, grasping the hand which his host held out to him."
"“非常好，斯塔尔先生。我在这儿避开了那些恶劣的天气，怎么可能不好呢？您家夏天去纽黑文或波托贝洛的女士们，若是在阿伯福伊尔煤矿里待上几个月会更好！在这儿，与在旧首府潮湿的大街上不一样，她们不会患上重感冒的。","“Very well, Mr. Starr.How could I be otherwise here, sheltered from the inclemencies of the weather?Your ladies who go to Newhaven or Portobello in the summer time would do much better to pass a few months in the coal mine of Aberfoyle!They would run no risk here of catching a heavy cold, as they do in the damp streets of the old capital.”"
"“我是不会反对您的，西蒙。”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，很高兴发现老工头仍旧和从前一样，“其实，我在想，为什么我不把在坎农格特的家换成您家旁边的一个村舍呢？”","“I’m not the man to contradict you, Simon,” answered James Starr, glad to find the old man just as he used to be.“Indeed, I wonder why I do not change my home in the Canongate for a cottage near you.”"
"“为什么不呢，斯塔尔先生？我知道，在您昔日的那群矿工中，有一个人真心地希望您和他之间只有一墙之隔。”","“And why not, Mr. Starr?I know one of your old miners who would be truly pleased to have only a partition wall between you and him.”"
"“马奇好吗？”工程师问道。","“And how is Madge?” asked the engineer."
"“女主人的身体比我还硬朗，如果可能的话。”福特回答道，“她会很高兴您出现在她的餐桌旁。我想，她会超水平地发挥来招待您。”","“The goodwife is in better health than I am, if that’s possible,” replied Ford, “and it will be a pleasure to her to see you at her table.I think she will surpass herself to do you honor.”"
"“咱们等着瞧吧，西蒙，咱们等着瞧吧！”工程师说道；对他而言，在长途跋涉后，有人告诉他会有一顿丰盛的早餐是不会令他无动于衷的。","“We shall see that, Simon, we shall see that!” said the engineer, to whom the announcement of a good breakfast could not be indifferent, after his long walk."
"“您饿了吗，斯塔尔先生？”","“Are you hungry, Mr. Starr?”"
"“饥肠辘辘。我这一路赶过来，早已胃口大开了。我是冒着恶劣的天气来的。”","“Ravenously hungry.My journey has given me an appetite.I came through horrible weather.”"
"“啊，那上面正下着雨。”西蒙·福特回应道。","“Ah, it is raining up there.” responded Simon Ford."
"“是啊，西蒙，福斯河的水和海水一样汹涌。”“噢，斯塔尔先生，这儿就从不下雨。但我不必向您描述所有的好处，您和我一样清楚。现在我们是在村舍里。这是最重要的事情，我再次欢迎您，先生。”","“Yes, Simon, and the waters of the Forth are as rough as the sea.”“Well, Mr. Starr, here it never rains.But I needn't describe to you all the advantages, which you know as well as myself.Here we are at the cottage.That is the chief thing, and I again say you are welcome, sir.”"
"西蒙·福特把他们的客人领进了住所，哈里跟在福特身后。詹姆斯·斯塔尔发现自己身处一个用许多灯照明的大房间里，其中一盏灯吊在顶上的彩色横梁上。","Simon Ford, followed by Harry, ushered their guest into the dwelling.James Starr found himself in a large room lighted by numerous lamps, one hanging from the colored beams of the roof."
"“汤好了，老婆，”福特说道，“不该让斯塔尔先生等久了。他饿得就像个矿工，他会看到我们的孩子让我们在村舍里什么都不缺！对了，哈里，”老工头转向他的儿子补充道，“杰克·瑞安来找过你。”","“The soup is ready, wife,” said Ford, “and it mustn’t be kept waiting any more than Mr. Starr.He is as hungry as a miner, and he shall see that our boy doesn't let us want for anything in the cottage!By-the-bye, Harry,” added the old overman, turning to his son, “Jack Ryan came here to see you.”"
"“我知道，父亲。我们在亚罗井碰见了他。”","“I know, father.We met him in the Yarrow shaft.”"
"“他是个真诚而快乐的小伙子，”福特说道，“但他似乎在地上过得很开心。他血管里流淌的不是真正的矿工血液。请坐，斯塔尔先生，请多吃一点，因为我们可能很晚才吃晚餐。”","“He’s an honest and a merry fellow,” said Ford, “but he seems to be quite happy above ground.He hasn’t the true miner’s blood in his veins.Sit down, Mr. Starr, and have a good dinner, for we may not sup till late.”"
"就在工程师和他的主人们就坐时:","As the engineer and his hosts were taking their places:"
"“等等，西蒙，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“您希望我吃饭时有个好胃口吗？”“这将是我们极大的荣幸,斯塔尔先生。”福特回答道。","“One moment, Simon,” said James Starr.“Do you want me to eat with a good appetite?”“It will be doing us all possible honor, Mr. Starr.” answered Ford."
"“好吧,为了吃得痛快,我应该一点儿也不焦虑才行。现在，我有两个问题要问您。”","“Well, in order to eat heartily, I must not be at all anxious.Now I have two questions to put to you.”"
"“请问，先生。”","“Go on, sir.”"
"“您在信里告诉我会有一则有趣的信息。”","“Your letter told me of a communication which was to be of an interesting nature.”"
"“的确很有趣。”","“It is very interesting indeed.”"
"“对您而言？”","“To you?”"
"“对您和我而言，斯塔尔先生。但是，我想等到饭后再告诉您，并且只能是在现场告诉您。不然的话您是不会相信我的。”","“To you and to me, Mr. Starr.But I do not want to tell it you until after dinner, and on the very spot itself.Without that you would not believe me.”"
"“西蒙，”工程师继续说道，“请直视我的脸。一则有趣的信息？是的。好的！我不多问了。”他补充道，好像他己从老工头的眼中读出了答案。","“Simon,” resumed the engineer, “look me straight in the face.An interesting communication?Yes.Good!I will not ask more.” he added, as if he had read the reply in the old overman’s eyes."
"“第二个问题呢？”后者问道。","“And the second question?” asked the latter."
"“西蒙，您知道可能是谁给我写的这封信吗？”工程师问道，递给他那封匿名信。","“Do you know, Simon, who the person is who can have written this?” answered the engineer, handing him the anonymous letter."
"福特接过信，专注地读着。随后，他把信递给他的儿子，“你认识这字迹吗？”他问道。","Ford took the letter and read it attentively.Then giving it to his son, “Do you know the writing?” he asked."
"“不认识，父亲。”哈里回答道。","“No, father.” replied Harry."
"“这封信盖了阿伯福伊尔的邮戳吗？”西蒙·福特询问道。","“And had this letter the Aberfoyle postmark?” inquired Simon Ford."
"“是的，和您的信一样。”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道。","“Yes, like yours,” replied James Starr."
"“你怎么看这事，哈里？”他父亲问道，额头蒙上了一层阴影。","“What do you think of that, Harry?” said his father, his brow darkening."
"“我认为，父亲，”哈里回答道，“有人有意阻扰斯塔尔先生到您邀请他来的地方。”","“I think, father,” returned Harry, “that someone has had some interest in trying to prevent Mr. Starr from coming to the place where you invited him.”"
"“但会是谁呢？”老矿工叫道，“谁能如此确切地猜到我的秘密呢？”西蒙陷入了沉思，他的妻子将他从沈思中唤醒。","“But who,” exclaimed the old miner, “who could have possibly guessed enough of my secret?”And Simon fell into a reverie, from which he was aroused by his wife."
"“我们开始吧，斯塔尔先生，”她说道，“汤快凉了。现在就不要再想那封信了。”","“Let us begin, Mr. Starr,” she said.“The soup is already getting cold.Don’t think any more of that letter just now.”"
"在老妇人的邀请下，大伙各自入座了，詹姆斯·斯塔尔坐在马奇对面——为了表示他的敬意——父子俩相对而坐。这是一顿丰盛的苏格兰饭菜。首先，他们喝了一道“大杂烩”汤，上好的汤中漂着肉。照老西蒙的说法，他的妻子做大杂烩的手艺无人可比。“韭菜鸡”也是如此，用韭菜炖鸡，堪称一绝。整顿饭配着由爱丁堡最好的啤酒厂酿造的上好麦芽酒下肚。","On the old woman’s invitation, each drew in his chair, James Starr opposite to Madge—to do him honor—the father and son opposite to each other.It was a good Scotch dinner.First they ate “hotchpotch,” soup with the meat swimming in capital broth.As old Simon said, his wife knew no rival in the art of preparing hotchpotch.It was the same with the “cockyleeky,” a cock stewed with leeks, which merited high praise.The whole was washed down with excellent ale, obtained from the best brewery in Edinburgh."
"但主菜是“羊肉杂碎布丁”，一种该民族用肉和大麦做成的布丁。这道菜非同凡响，它启发诗人彭斯吟出了他最优美的颂诗，它和世界上所有美好的事情有着相同的命运——它像梦一样的就下肚了。","But the principal dish consisted of a “haggis,” the national pudding, made of meat and barley meal.This remarkable dish, which inspired the poet Burns with one of his best odes, shared the fate of all the good things in this world—it passed away like a dream."
"马奇得到了客人诚挚的赞美。这顿饭最后上的是奶酪和燕麦饼，还配上了几小杯“爱尔兰芫荽香甜酒”，这是一种上好的威士忌，已有二十五年的历史——恰好是哈里的年纪。这顿饭足足吃了一个小时。詹姆斯·斯塔尔和西蒙·福特吃了很多，也说了很多，他们主要谈了他们在老阿伯福伊尔的昔日生活。","Madge received the sincere compliments of her guest.The dinner ended with cheese and oatcake, accompanied by a few small glasses of “usquebaugh,” capital whisky, five and twenty years old—just Harry’s age.The repast lasted a good hour.James Starr and Simon Ford had not only eaten much, but talked much too, chiefly of their past life in the old Aberfoyle mine."
"哈里显得相当沉默。他两次离开了餐桌，甚至离开了屋子。自石头事件以来，他明显感到不安，想要检查村舍的周围情况。那封匿名信并没有让他消除疑虑。","Harry had been rather silent.Twice he had left the table, and even the house.He evidently felt uneasy since the incident of the stone, and wished to examine the environs of the cottage.The anonymous letter had not contributed to reassure him."
"在他离席期间，工程师对福特和他的妻子说道，“你们有个好孩子啊，我的朋友。”","Whilst he was absent, the engineer observed to Ford and his wife, “That’s a fine lad you have there, my friends.”"
"“是啊，斯塔尔先生，他是一个善良贴心的儿子。”老工头由衷地回答道。","“Yes, Mr. Starr, he is a good and affectionate son,” replied the old overman earnestly."
"“和你们一起住在村舍里，他幸福吗？”","“Is he happy with you in the cottage?”"
"“他不会想要离开我们的。”","“He would not wish to leave us.”"
"“难道你们没想过在哪天为他找个妻子吗？”","“Don’t you think of finding him a wife, some day?”"
"“为哈里找个妻子，”福特惊叹道，“那会是谁？一个从地上来的姑娘，她会喜欢玩乐和跳舞，她会更喜欢她的家族，而不是我们的煤矿！哈里不会那么做的！”","“A wife for Harry,” exclaimed Ford,“And who would it be?A girl from up yonder, who would love merry-makings and dancing, who would prefer her clan to our mine!Harry wouldn’t do it!”"
"“西蒙，”马奇说道，“你不能阻止哈里娶妻。”","“Simon,” said Madge, “you would not forbid that Harry should take a wife.”"
"“我不会阻止任何事情，”老矿工回答道，“但这事并不着急。谁知道呢，但我们会为他找一个——”","“I would forbid nothing,” returned the old miner, “but there’s no hurry about that.Who knows but we may find one for him—” "
"此时，哈里又进屋来了，西蒙·福特也不出声了。","Harry re-entered at that moment, and Simon Ford was silent."
"当马奇在餐桌旁起身时，所有人也随她起身，在村舍的门口坐下来。“好了，西蒙，”工程师说道，“我准备好听您说了。”","When Madge rose from the table, all followed her example, and seated themselves at the door of the cottage.“Well, Simon,” said the engineer, “I am ready to hear you.”"
"“斯塔尔先生，”福特说道，“我不需要您听我说，只要您跟我来。您休整好了吗？”","“Mr. Starr,” responded Ford, “I do not need your ears, but your legs.Are you quite rested?”"
"“休整好了，也恢复好了，西蒙。我准备好了同你一起去，去你想去的那个地方。”","“Quite rested and quite refreshed, Simon.I am ready to go with you wherever you like.”"
"“哈里，”西蒙·福特转向他的儿子说道，“点上我们的安全灯。”","“Harry,” said Simon Ford, turning to his son, “light our safety lamps.”"
"“您打算带上安全灯？”詹姆斯·斯塔尔诧异地叫道。他清楚，在一个煤被完全挖空的矿井里是无需担心甲烷爆炸的。","“Are you going to take safety lamps?” exclaimed James Starr, in amazement, knowing that there was no fear of explosions of fire-damp in a pit quite empty of coal."
"“不错，斯塔尔先生，慎重起见。”","“Yes, Mr. Starr, it will be prudent.”"
"“我善良的西蒙，接下来，难道您会建议我穿上一套矿工制服吗？”","“My good Simon, won't you propose next to put me in a miner’s dress?”"
"“还不是时候，先生，还不是时候！”老工头回答道，他深陷的双眼闪烁着怪异的目光。","“Not just yet, sir, not just yet!” returned the old overman, his deep-set eyes gleaming strangely."
"哈里很快回来了，手里拎着三盏安全灯。他把其中一盏灯递给了工程师，又将另一盏递给了他父亲，将剩下的那一盏灯挂在他的左手上，而他的右手握着一根长棍当武器。","Harry soon reappeared, carrying three safety lamps.He handed one of these to the engineer, the other to his father, and kept the third hanging from his left hand, whilst his right was armed with a long stick."
"“出发！”西蒙·福特说道，拿起一把倚在村舍墙上的结实的镐。","“Forward!” said Simon Ford, taking up a strong pick, which was leaning against the wall of the cottage."
"“出发！”工程师附和道，“再见，马奇。”","“Forward!” echoed the engineer.“Good-by, Madge.”"
"“祝你成功！”善良的妇女回答道。","“GOD speed you!” responded the good woman."
"“准备一顿丰盛的晚餐，老婆，听到了吗？”福特叫道，“我们回来时该饿了，要尽情地吃一顿！”","“A good supper, wife, do you hear?” exclaimed Ford.“We shall be hungry when we come back, and will do it justice!”"
"第五章 某些奇怪的现象","CHAPTER V SOME STRANGE PHENOMENA"
"在苏格兰高地和低地，流传着许多迷信的说法。当然，矿工们必然会把传说和寓言中的事件加到这类神话剧中。如果说这些地区住满了想象中的生灵，无论是善良的还是邪恶的，那就更有理由说明在黑暗煤矿的最深处必定有幽灵出没。是谁在风雨交加的夜晚晃动着煤层？是谁将矿工们带到尚未开采的矿脉小道上的？是谁点燃甲烷，并指挥了那些可怕的爆炸？除了煤矿里的某个幽灵外，还会是谁呢？这个观点至少在迷信的苏格兰人中间普遍流传着。","Many superstitious beliefs exist both in the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland.Of course the mining population must furnish its contingent of legends and fables to this mythological repertory.If the fields are peopled with imaginary beings, either good or bad, with much more reason must the dark mines be haunted to their lowest depths.Who shakes the seam during tempestuous nights?Who puts the miners on the track of an as yet unworked vein?Who lights the fire-damp, and presides over the terrible explosions?Who but some spirit of the mine?This, at least, was the opinion commonly spread among the superstitious Scotch."
"在多查特矿井，哈里的朋友杰克·瑞安在这些信奉超自然力的人中占有头等重要的位置。他是所有这些迷信的坚定信奉者。他把所有这些荒诞离奇的故事改编成了歌曲，这让他在冬日的晚上赢得了许多掌声。","In the first rank of the believers in the supernatural in the Dochart pit figured Jack Ryan, Harry’s friend.He was the great partisan of all these superstitions.All these wild stories were turned by him into songs, which earned him great applause in the winter evenings."
"然而并不只是杰克·瑞安一人有这种信仰。他的同伴们也坚定地断言，阿伯福伊尔矿井里有幽灵出没，人们在那里常常会看到某些奇怪的生灵，就如在高地看到的一样。听他们这么说，要是根本没出现那种东西，那才更离奇。的确，会有哪个地方比黑暗幽深的煤矿更适合那些妖精、精灵、妖怪以及其他怪诞戏剧里的角色呢？舞台布景一切就位，为什么那些具有超自然力的名角们不来出演他们的角色呢？","But Jack Ryan was not alone in his belief.His comrades affirmed, no less strongly, that the Aberfoyle pits were haunted, and that certain strange beings were seen there frequently, just as in the Highlands.To hear them talk, it would have been more extraordinary if nothing of the kind appeared.Could there indeed be a better place than a dark and deep coal mine for the freaks of fairies, elves, goblins, and other actors in the fantastical dramas?The scenery was all ready, why should not the supernatural personages come there to play their parts?"
"杰克·瑞安与他在阿伯福伊尔煤矿的同伴们这么推敲着。我们已经讲过，不同的矿井由长长的地下水平巷道彼此相连。因此，在斯特林郡地下有一片广阔的地带，那里到处都是地道、隧道，还凿有洞穴、钻有矿井。这座地下迷宫堪比一个巨大的蚁丘。","So reasoned Jack Ryan and his comrades in the Aberfoyle mines.We have said that the different pits communicated with each other by means of long subterranean galleries.Thus there existed beneath the county of Stirling a vast tract, full of burrows, tunnels, bored with caves, and perforated with shafts, a subterranean labyrinth, which might be compared to an enormous ant-hill."
"尽管矿工们隶属不同的矿井，但他们前往矿井或收工回家时会经常碰面。因此，他们经常有机会交谈，在各个矿井间传播着那些源于煤矿的故事。这些叙述以口口相传的方式极其快速地传播着，并随着传播变得愈发离奇。","Miners, though belonging to different pits, often met, when going to or returning from their work.Consequently there was a constant opportunity of exchanging talk, and circulating the stories which had their origin in the mine, from one pit to another.These accounts were transmitted with marvelous rapidity, passing from mouth to mouth, and gaining in wonder as they went."
"不过，有两个人因为受过更好的教育，并拥有比他人更实际的头脑，所以总能抵制住这种邪念。他们丝毫不信幽灵、精灵或妖怪的介入。这两人就是西蒙·福特和他的儿子。为了证明这一点，在多查特矿井遭遗弃后，他们继续居住在阴暗的地穴里。和每个高地女人一样，善良的马奇也有些倾向于相信超自然力。但她不得不只在自己内心重复所有这些故事，她也非常认真地这样做了，只为使古老的传统得以保留。","Two men, however, better educated and with more practical minds than the rest, had always resisted this temptation.They in no degree believed in the intervention of spirits, Elves, or goblins.These two were Simon Ford and his son.And they proved it by continuing to inhabit the dismal crypt, after the desertion of the Dochart pit.Perhaps good Madge, like every Highland woman, had some leaning towards the supernatural.But she had to repeat all these stories to herself, and so she did, most conscientiously, so as not to let the old traditions be lost."
"即便西蒙和哈里像他们的同伴一样轻信于迷信，他们也不会将矿井弃给魔鬼与妖精。这对父子十年如一日，带着他们的镐、拐杖和灯，执拗而坚定地秉持着他们的信念。他们四处搜寻，猛烈敲击岩石来进行探测，聆听是否会传回一个有所帮助的声音。只要探测还未推进到原始形态的花岗岩，西蒙·福特和哈里·福特就一致认为，今天搜寻不到，可能明天会搜寻到，而探测应该继续进行。他们一辈子都在为重现阿伯福伊尔往昔的繁荣而奋斗。如果父亲未等到成功之时便离去了，儿子将独自一人继续完成任务。","Even had Simon and Harry Ford been as credulous as their companions, they would not have abandoned the mine to the imps and fairies.For ten years, without missing a single day, obstinate and immovable in their convictions, the father and son took their picks, their sticks, and their lamps.They went about searching, sounding the rock with a sharp blow, listening if it would return a favor-able sound.So long as the soundings had not been pushed to the granite of the primary formation, the Fords were agreed that the search, unsuccessful to-day, might succeed to-morrow, and that it ought to be resumed.They spent their whole life in endeavoring to bring Aberfoyle back to its former prosperity.If the father died before the hour of success, the son was to go on with the task alone."
"在这些征途中，哈里对某些他无从解释的现象印象尤深。有几次，当他沿着某个狭窄的十字小巷行走时，他似乎听到了类似用鹤嘴锄猛烈敲击岩壁的声音。","It was during these excursions that Harry was more particularly struck by certain phenomena, which he vainly sought to explain.Several times, while walking along some narrow cross-alley, he seemed to hear sounds similar to those which would be produced by violent blows of a pickax against the wall."
"哈里急忙寻找这神秘行为的源头。隧道是空的。年轻矿工的灯光映照在岩壁上，却不见任何刚用镐或铁撬动过的痕迹。随后，哈里自问这是否是某种幻听效果，或是某种奇异怪诞的回声。还有几次，当他突然将明亮的灯光投射在岩石上一处看似可疑的裂缝上时，他觉得自己看到了一个影子。他冲上前去。什么都没有，而且没有任何出口能让一个人摆脱他的追逐！","Harry hastened to seek the cause of this mysterious work.The tunnel was empty.The light from the young miner’s lamp, thrown on the wall, revealed no trace of any recent work with pick or crowbar.Harry would then ask himself if it was not the effect of some acoustic illusion, or some strange and fantastic echo.At other times, on suddenly throwing a bright light into a suspicious-looking cleft in the rock, he thought he saw a shadow.He rushed forward.Nothing, and there was no opening to permit a human being to evade his pursuit!"
"在一个月里曾发生过两次情况。有一次哈里正查看矿井西端时，他清楚地听到了远处的声响，就像是某个矿工引爆了炸药一样。。第二次，在他仔细搜寻多次后，他发现了一根刚被炸过的柱子。","Twice in one month, Harry, whilst visiting the west end of the pit, distinctly heard distant reports, as if some miner had exploded a charge of dynamite.The second time, after many careful researches, he found that a pillar had just been blown up."
"借着灯光，哈里仔细检查了被炸过的地方。那不是由石头制成的简易填方，而是一整块穿进煤层深处的片岩。爆炸的目的是为了发现一处新矿脉吗？或许只是有人想毁掉这部分煤矿？他这样怀疑着。当他告诉父亲这件事时，老工头和哈里自己都无法对这个问题给出一个满意的答案。","By the light of his lamp, Harry carefully examined the place attacked by the explosion.It had not been made in a simple embankment of stones, but in a mass of schist, which had penetrated to this depth in the coal stratum.Had the object of the explosion been to discover a new vein?Or had someone wished simply to destroy this portion of the mine?Thus he questioned, and when he made known this occurrence to his father, neither could the old overman nor he himself answer the question in a satisfactory way."
"“这很奇怪，”哈里常常重复道，“似乎不可能有陌生人出现在煤矿里，这一点毫无疑问。会是除我们之外的某个人想弄清是否仍有煤层存在吗？或者相反，他是企图毁掉阿伯福伊尔煤矿的剩余部分吗？但为什么呢？我会将它弄清楚的，即便会赔上我的性命！”","“It is very queer,” Harry often repeated.“The presence of an unknown being in the mine seems impossible, and yet there can be no doubt about it.Does someone besides ourselves wish to find out if a seam yet exists?Or, rather, has he attempted to destroy what remains of the Aberfoyle mines?But for what reason?I will find that out, if it should cost me my life!”"
"在哈里·福特领着工程师穿过多查特矿井迷宫的两周前，他几乎快要找到他所要搜寻的目标了。他手拎一盏大提灯，仔细检查着煤矿的西南端。忽然，他似乎看到在他前面几百英尺处，就在一条从岩石中斜穿而过的狭窄通道的末端，一点光亮突然间熄灭了。他飞奔过去。","A fortnight before the day on which Harry Ford guided the engineer through the labyrinth of the Dochart pit, he had been on the point of attaining the object of his search.He was going over the southwest end of the mine, with a large lantern in his hand.All at once, it seemed to him that a light was suddenly extinguished, some hundred feet before him, at the end of a narrow passage cut obliquely through the rock.He darted forward."
"他什么也没有搜寻到。由于哈里不肯对一件实实在在发生的事件作出超自然的解释，因此他得出结论，必定有某个陌生人在矿井里出没。但是，无论他怎么做，不管是细致入微地搜寻，还是细查水平巷道里每个岩石的裂隙，他都没为自己的困惑找到答案。","His search was in vain.As Harry would not admit a supernatural explanation for a physical occurrence, he concluded that certainly some strange being prowled about in the pit.But whatever he could do, searching with the greatest care, scrutinizing every crevice in the gallery, he found nothing for his trouble."
"如果杰克·瑞安和矿里其他信迷信的同伴看到了这些灯光，他们一定会称它们为超自然力，但哈里从未想过这么做，他父亲也没有。当他们谈论这些显然是由一个真实存在的原因所导致的现象时，“我的孩子，”老工头会说，“我们必须等待。总有一天会水落石出。”","If Jack Ryan and the other superstitious fellows in the mine had seen these lights, they would, without fail, have called them supernatural, but Harry did not dream of doing so, nor did his father.And when they talked over these phenomena, evidently due to a physical cause, “My lad,” the old man would say, “We must wait.It will all be explained some day.”"
"然而，必须注意的是，迄今为止，无论是哈里还是他的父亲，都不曾遭到任何暴力袭击。如果那块落在詹姆斯·斯塔尔脚下的石头是某个心怀恶意的人扔出的，那么这是第一次发生此类罪行。","However, it must be observed that, hitherto, neither Harry nor his father had ever been exposed to any act of violence.If the stone which had fallen at the feet of James Starr had been thrown by the hand of some ill-disposed person, it was the first criminal act of that description."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔认为那块石头是从水平巷道的洞顶脱落的，但哈里不认同如此简单的解释。据他猜测，那块石头不是落下的，而是被扔下的；若不是如此，没有了反弹，它绝不会像那样在空中划出一道轨迹。哈里从中看到了一个直指自己和他父亲，甚至直指工程师的图谋。","James Starr was of opinion that the stone had become detached from the roof of the gallery; but Harry would not admit of such a simple explanation.According to him, the stone had not fallen, it had been thrown; for otherwise, without rebounding, it could never have described a trajectory as it did.Harry saw in it a direct attempt against himself and his father, or even against the engineer."
"第六章　西蒙·福特的实验","CHAPTER VI SIMON FORD’s EXPERIMENT"
"当詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的两个同伴出去时，村舍里的老钟敲了一下。一缕昏暗的光线从通风井渗进了空地。哈里的灯虽在这儿用不上，但它很快会派上用场的，因为老工头打算把工程师带到多查特矿井的最尾端。沿着主水平巷道走了两英里后，这三位勘探者——因为大家将会看到这是一次常规的勘探——来到一条狭窄隧道的入口处。它就像一个教堂的中殿，顶部靠木架支撑，上面覆盖着发白的苔藓。隧道的线路与上方1500英尺处的福斯河河道几乎一致。“我们是要去最后一处矿脉的末端吗？”詹姆斯·斯塔尔问道。","The old clock in the cottage struck one as James Starr and his two companions went out.A dim light penetrated through the ventilating shaft into the glade.Harry’s lamp was not necessary here, but it would very soon be of use, for the old overman was about to conduct the engineer to the very end of the Dochart pit.After following the principal gallery for a distance of two miles, the three explorers—for, as will be seen, this was a regular exploration—arrived at the entrance of a narrow tunnel.It was like a nave, the roof of which rested on woodwork, covered with white moss.It followed very nearly the line traced by the course of the river Forth, fifteen hundred feet above.“So we are going to the end of the last vein?” said James Starr."
"“是啊！您依旧对煤矿相当熟悉。”“好了，西蒙，”工程师回答道，“如果我没弄错，再往前走会有些困难了。”","“Ay!You know the mine well still.”“Well, Simon,” returned the engineer, “it will be difficult to go further than that, if I don’t mistake.”"
"“是的，的确，斯塔尔先生。就在那儿，我们用镐从煤层里挖出了最后一块煤。这仿佛是发生在昨天的事一样，我现在还记得。最后我亲自敲了一下，那敲击声回响在我的心头，比岩石的回声更加沉闷。那之后，我们周围只剩下砂岩和片岩，当车皮开进矿井里时，我跟在后面，心里沉甸甸的，就好像那是一场葬礼。对我而言，仿佛煤矿的灵魂也随之一同离去了。”","“Yes, indeed, Mr. Starr.That was where our picks tore out the last bit of coal in the seam.I remember it as if it were yesterday.I myself gave that last blow, and it re-echoed in my heart more dismally than on the rock.Only sandstone and schist were round us after that, and when the truck rolled towards the shaft, I followed, with my heart as full as though it were a funeral.It seemed to me that the soul of the mine was going with it.”"
"老工头说这些话时的庄重模样令工程师起敬，他完全能体会到老工头的情绪。他们就像那些舍弃自己破损船只的海员，就像那些目睹自己祖居被拆毁的业主。他紧握住福特的手；而现在，后者也抓着工程师的手，紧紧地握着。","The gravity with which the old man uttered these words impressed the engineer, who was not far from sharing his sentiments.They were those of the sailor who leaves his disabled vessel—of the proprietor who sees the house of his ancestors pulled down.He pressed Ford’s hand; but now the latter seized that of the engineer, and, wringing it:"
"“那天我们都错了。”他叫道，“不！老煤矿还没死。它不是矿工们遗弃的一具尸体，我敢断言，斯塔尔先生，它的心仍在跳动。”","“That day we were all of us mistaken,” he exclaimed.“No! The old mine was not dead.It was not a corpse that the miners abandoned; and I dare to assert, Mr. Starr, that its heart beats still.”"
"“说下去，福特！您已经发现了新矿脉吗？”工程师不由自主地叫道，“我知道您已经发现了！您的信不可能是指其他事情。”","“Speak, Ford!Have you discovered a new vein?” cried the engineer, unable to contain himself.“I know you have!Your letter could mean nothing else.”"
"“斯塔尔先生，”西蒙·福特说道，“除了您，我不愿告诉任何人。”","“Mr. Starr,” said Simon Ford, “I did not wish to tell any man but yourself.”"
"“您做得非常对，福特。那告诉我，您是怎样确定的？通过什么迹象来确定的？”","“And you did quite right, Ford.But tell me how, by what signs, are you sure?”"
"“听我说，先生！”西蒙继续道，“我没有发现煤层。”","“Listen, sir!” resumed Simon.“It is not a seam that I have found.”"
"“那是什么呢？”","“What is it, then?”"
"“只是有这样一个煤层存在的确凿证据。”","“Only positive proof that such a seam exists.”"
"“那这证据是？”","“And the proof?”"
"“如果地下深处没有煤产生甲烷，甲烷可能会从那儿涌出吗？”","“Could fire-damp issue from the bowels of the earth if coal was not there to produce it?”"
"“不会，绝对不会！”工程师回答道，“没有煤，便没有甲烷。没有无因之果。”","“No, certainly not!” replied the engineer.“No coal, no fire-damp.No effects without a cause.”"
"“如同没有火便没有烟一样。”","“Just as no smoke without fire.”"
"“那您识别出有重量较轻的碳化氢了吗？”","“And have you recognized the presence of light carburetted hydrogen?”"
"“一个老矿工是不可能受骗的，”福特回答道，“我碰到了我们昔日的仇敌——甲烷！”","“An old miner could not be deceived,” answered Ford.“I have met with our old enemy, the fire-damp!”"
"“但倘若这是另一种气体，”斯塔尔说道，“甲烷几乎无味无色。只有爆炸才会真正地暴露出它的存在。”","“But suppose it was another gas,” said Starr.“Firedamp is almost without smell, and colorless.It only really betrays its presence by an explosion.”"
"“斯塔尔先生，”西蒙·福特说道，“请让我告诉您我做了些什么吧，好吗？曾有一两次，在去煤矿西端的路途中，哈里注意到某些不寻常的事情。突然间灭掉的火有时又沿着岩石表面或在较远的水平巷道填方上出现。那些火焰是如何被点燃的，我当时说不清，现在也一样。但它们显然是因为有瓦斯的存在，对我而言，甲烷就意味着矿脉。”","“Mr. Starr,” said Simon Ford, “will you let me tell you what I have done?Harry had once or twice observed something remarkable in his excursions to the west end of the mine.Fire, which suddenly went out, sometimes appeared along the face of the rock or on the embankment of the further galleries.How those flames were lighted, I could not and cannot say.But they were evidently owing to the presence of fire-damp, and to me fire-damp means a vein of coal.”"
"“难道这些火没有引发爆炸吗？”工程师急忙问道。","“Did not these fires cause any explosion?” asked the engineer quickly."
"“有的，小范围的爆炸，”福特回答道，“就像我原来为了确定甲烷的存在曾亲自引发的爆炸一样。在咱们善良的天才汉弗莱·戴维发明他的安全灯之前，这种做法就是防范爆炸的惯例，您记得吗？”","“Yes, little partial explosions,” replied Ford, “such as I used to cause myself when I wished to ascertain the presence of fire-damp.Do you remember how formerly it was the custom to try to prevent explosions before our good genius, Humphry Davy, invented his safety-lamp?”"
"“记得，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，“您是指人们称之为‘修道士’的人过去常做的事。但我从没见过他履行职责。”","“Yes,” replied James Starr.“You mean what the ‘monk,’ as the men called him, used to do.But I have never seen him in the exercise of his duty.”"
"“确实，斯塔尔先生，尽管您五十五岁了，但您还太年轻，没见过那个。而我大您十岁，曾常常看到最后一位‘修道士’在煤矿里干活。他被这样称呼是因为他穿着一件长袍，就像一名修道士一样。他应当被称作‘消防员’。那时，没有其他方法能消除这种危险气体，只能在它升高并大量积聚在水平巷道顶部时以小的爆炸将之驱散。修道士就像我们称呼他的那样，戴着面具，头被包着，全身紧紧地裹在一件厚厚的毛毡斗篷里，沿着地面匍匐前行。当空气纯净时，他可以在低处呼吸，并用他的右手在头顶上方挥动着燃烧的火把。当甲烷积聚在空气中从而形成爆炸混合物时，会发生并非灾难性的爆炸。人们可以通过经常重复这项操作来防止灾难的发生。有时，‘修道士’会在工作中受伤或死掉，然后，另一个人就会接替他的位置。戴维灯被普遍运用之后，所有的煤矿里才停止了这种做法。但是，我清楚这种操作，通过这种方式我发现了瓦斯的存在，因而也发现多查特矿井里的一个新煤层。”","“Indeed, Mr. Starr, you are too young, in spite of your five-and-fifty years, to have seen that.But I, ten years older, often saw the last ‘monk’ working in the mine.He was called so because he wore a long robe like a monk.His proper name was the ‘fireman.’ At that time there was no other means of destroying the bad gas but by dispersing it in little explosions, before its buoyancy had collected it in too great quantities in the heights of the galleries.The monk, as we called him, with his face masked, his head muffled up, all his body tightly wrapped in a thick felt cloak, crawled along the ground.He could breathe down there, when the air was pure; and with his right hand he waved above his head a blazing torch.When the firedamp had accumulated in the air, so as to form a detonating mixture, the explosion occurred without being fatal, and, by often renewing this operation, catastrophes were prevented.Sometimes the ‘monk’ was injured or killed in his work, then another took his place.This was done in all mines until the Davy lamp was universally adopted.But I knew the plan, and by its means I discovered the presence of firedamp and consequently that of a new seam of coal in the Dochart pit.”"
"老工头讲述的所谓“修道士”或“消防员”的事情都是千真万确的。从前，煤矿水平巷道里的空气一直通过上述方式净化。","All that the old overman had related of the so-called “monk” or “fireman” was perfectly true.The air in the galleries of mines was formerly always purified in the way described."
"甲烷、沼气或碳化氢是无色的，几乎没有气味，燃烧时呈蓝色火焰，会令人窒息。矿工不可能居住在一个充满这种有害气体的地方，如同不能居住在一个满是普通煤气的储气库里一样。而且，甲烷和后者一样，是一种易燃气体的混合物，一旦它在空气中积聚至百分之八，甚至可能是百分之五，就会形成一种爆炸混合物。当这种混合物因任何原因被点燃时，爆炸就会发生，接踵而至的几乎总是一场可怕的灾难。","Fire-damp, marsh-gas, or carburetted hydrogen, is colorless, almost scentless; it burns with a blue flame, and makes respiration impossible.The miner could not live in a place filled with this injurious gas, any more than one could live in a gasometer full of common gas.Moreover, fire-damp, as well as the latter, a mixture of inflammable gases, forms a detonating mixture as soon as the air unites with it in a proportion of eight, and perhaps even five to the hundred.When this mixture is lighted by any cause, there is an explosion, almost always followed by a frightful catastrophe."
"西蒙·福特边走边对工程师讲述为达到自己的目的他所做的一切：他如何确定甲烷是从西端最远的水平巷道溢出的，因为他引发了小范围的爆炸，还有那极小的火焰，那都足以说明溢出气体的性质。气体从一个小喷口溢出，却一直源源不断。","As they walked on, Simon Ford told the engineer all that he had done to attain his object; how he was sure that the escape of fire-damp took place at the very end of the farthest gallery in its western part, because he had provoked small and partial explosions, or rather little flames, enough to show the nature of the gas, which escaped in a small jet, but with a continuous flow.@@@@@@As they walked on, Simon Ford told the engineer all that he had done to attain his object; how he was sure that the escape of fire-damp took place at the very end of the farthest gallery in its western part,because he had provoked small and partial explosions, or rather little flames, enough to show the nature of the gas, which escaped in a small jet, but with a continuous flow."
"在离开村舍一小时后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的两个同伴已经走了四英里远。工程师好奇而充满希望地行走着，没有注意到走出了多远。他思索着老矿工告诉他的一切，脑子里斟酌着老矿工为证明自己论断所说的所有论据。他同意老工头的那个观点，认为源源不断溢出的碳化氢必定表明有一处新煤层存在。如果只是一个矿穴里充满了煤气，就像间或在岩石中发现的那样，煤气很快就会没有了，这种现象也会消失。但远非那样。根据西蒙·福特所言，甲烷在持续不断地溢出，从这一事实可以断定有一个重要的矿脉存在。因此，多查特矿井的宝藏并没有完全枯竭。现在，首要问题是，这是否只是一个产出较少的矿脉，或是一个范围宽广的煤床。","An hour after leaving the cottage, James Starr and his two companions had gone a distance of four miles.The engineer, urged by anxiety and hope, walked on without noticing the length of the way.He pondered over all that the old miner had told him, and mentally weighed all the arguments which the latter had given in support of his belief.He agreed with him in thinking that the continued emission of carburetted hydrogen certainly showed the existence of a new coal-seam.If it had been merely a sort of pocket, full of gas, as it is sometimes found amongst the rock, it would soon have been empty, and the phenomenon have ceased.But far from that.According to Simon Ford, the fire-damp escaped incessantly, and from that fact the existence of an important vein might be considered certain.Consequently, the riches of the Dochart pit were not entirely exhausted.The chief question now was, whether this was merely a vein which would yield comparatively little, or a bed occupying a large extent."
"走在父亲和工程师前面的哈里停了下来。","Harry, who preceded his father and the engineer, stopped."
"“就是这儿！”老矿工叫道，“终于到了，感谢上苍！就是这儿，斯塔尔先生，我们很快会知道的。”老工头的声音微微颤抖着。","“Here we are!” exclaimed the old miner.“At last, thank Heaven! you are here, Mr. Starr, and we shall soon know.”The old overman’s voice trembled slightly."
"“镇定点，我的伙计！”工程师说道，“我也和您一样激动，但我们不该耽搁时间。”","“Be calm, my man!” said the engineer.“I am as excited as you are, but we must not lose time.”"
"位于矿井这一端的水平巷道拓宽成了一个黑暗的洞穴。没有矿井穿过这个部分，而且水平巷道凿在地下深处，不与地面直接连通。","The gallery at this end of the pit widened into a sort of dark cave.No shaft had been pierced in this part, and the gallery, bored into the bowels of the earth, had no direct communication with the surface of the earth."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔带着浓厚的兴趣检查了他们站立的地方。在洞穴的岩壁上，镐的痕迹依旧可见，甚至开采接近尾声时在岩石上爆破的洞孔都仍然可见。片岩坚硬无比，因此无需把将近完工的隧道末端封住。在片岩和第三层砂岩之间，矿脉已被采竭殆尽了。多查特矿井的最后一块煤正是从此处被挖出的。","James Starr, with intense interest, examined the place in which they were standing.On the walls of the cavern the marks of the pick could still be seen, and even holes in which the rock had been blasted, near the termination of the working.The schist was excessively hard, and it had not been necessary to bank up the end of the tunnel where the works had come to an end.There the vein had failed, between the schist and the tertiary sandstone.From this very place had been extracted the last piece of coal from the Dochart pit."
"“我们必须敲击这个岩脉，”福特举起他的镐说道，“因为在裂缝的另一边，在差不多同样的深度，我们肯定会找到矿脉，我坚信它的存在。”","“We must attack the dyke,” said Ford, raising his pick; “for at the other side of the break, at more or less depth, we shall assuredly find the vein, the existence of which I assert.”"
"“您是在这些岩石的表层发现甲烷的吗？”詹姆斯·斯塔尔问道。","“And was it on the surface of these rocks that you found out the fire-damp?” asked James Starr."
"“就在那儿，先生，”福特回答道，“只要把我的灯靠近岩石的裂缝，我就能把它点燃。哈里和我一样，也这样做过。”","“Just there, sir,” returned Ford, “and I was able to light it only by bringing my lamp near to the cracks in the rock.Harry has done it as well as I.”"
"“在多高的位置？”斯塔尔问道。","“At what height?” asked Starr."
"“距地面十英尺，”哈里回答道。","“Ten feet from the ground,” replied Harry."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔在一块岩石上坐了下来。仔细嗅了嗅洞穴里的空气后，他盯着这两个矿工，似乎在质疑他们的话，虽然他们非常坚定。实际上，碳化氢并非完全没有气味，工程师的嗅觉非常灵敏，他十分讶异地发现这儿并没有爆炸性气体的存在。无论怎样，如果煤气全混在周围的空气里，那也只是极小的一部分。这里没有爆炸的危险，他们可以毫无顾忌地打开安全灯尝试进行实验，就像老矿工之前所做的一样。","James Starr had seated himself on a rock.After critically inhaling the air of the cavern, he gazed at the two miners, almost as if doubting their words, decided as they were.In fact, carburetted hydrogen is not completely scentless, and the engineer, whose sense of smell was very keen, was astonished that it had not revealed the presence of the explosive gas.At any rate, if the gas had mingled at all with the surrounding air, it could only be in a very small stream.There was no danger of an explosion, and they might without fear open the safety lamp to try the experiment, just as the old miner had done before."
"让詹姆斯·斯塔尔感到困扰的不是空气中混有过多气体，而是只混有一丁点儿气体或是没有混入气体。","What troubled James Starr was, not lest too much gas mingled with the air, but lest there should be little or none."
"“会是他们弄错了吗？”他咕哝道，“不会的，他们知道自己在做什么。然而——”","“Could they have been mistaken?” he murmured.“No: these men know what they are about.And yet—”"
"他无比焦虑地等待西蒙·福特所说的现象发生。但这时，哈里似乎和工程师一样也注意到了没有甲烷的特殊气味，他用变调的声音惊叫道，“父亲，我认为气体不再从这些裂隙中溢出了！”","He waited, not without some anxiety, until Simon Ford’s phenomenon should have taken place.But just then it seemed that Harry, like himself, had remarked the absence of the characteristic odor of fire-damp; for he exclaimed in an altered voice, “Father, I should say the gas was no longer escaping through the cracks!”"
"“不再溢出了！”老矿工叫道——他紧紧地抿住嘴唇，吸了几口气。","“No longer!” cried the old miner—and, pressing his lips tight together, he snuffed the air several times."
"随后，他突然动了一下，“把你的灯递给我，哈里。”他说道。","Then, all at once, with a sudden movement, “Hand me your lamp, Harry,” he said."
"福特颤抖着用一只手接过灯。他抽掉了围着灯芯的铁纱罩，火焰在空气中燃烧起来。","Ford took the lamp with a trembling hand.He drew off the wire gauze case which surrounded the wick, and the flame burned in the open air."
"和他们预想的一样，没有爆炸，但更糟糕的是，甚至连显示少量甲烷存在的轻微噼啪声也没有。西蒙接过哈里手中的棍子，将灯固定在棍子的末端，把灯高举过头顶，一直举到煤气因上浮而自然积聚到的地方。灯的火焰垂直而清晰地燃烧着，表明没有任何碳化氢的踪迹。","As they had expected, there was no explosion, but, what was more serious, there was not even the slight crackling which indicates the presence of a small quantity of firedamp.Simon took the stick which Harry was holding, fixed his lamp to the end of it, and raised it high above his head, up to where the gas, by reason of its buoyancy, would naturally accumulate.The flame of the lamp, burning straight and clear, revealed no trace of the carburetted hydrogen."
"“靠近岩壁。”工程师说道。","“Close to the wall,” said the engineer."
"“好的，”福特回答道，把灯放到昨晚他和他儿子曾证实有煤气溢出的岩壁那儿。","“Yes,” responded Ford, carrying the lamp to that part of the wall at which he and his son had, the evening before, proved the escape of gas."
"当老矿工试图把灯举高时，他的胳膊在颤抖。“来替我，哈里。”他说道。","The old miner’s arm trembled whilst he tried to hoist the lamp up.“Take my place, Harry,” said he."
"哈里接过棍子，不停地把灯放到岩石的各个裂缝处；但他摇了摇头，因为他没有听到甲烷溢出时特有的轻微噼啪声。没有火焰。显然，没有一丝煤气从岩石里溢出。","Harry took the stick, and successively presented the lamp to the different fissures in the rock; but he shook his head, for of that slight crackling peculiar to escaping fire-damp he heard nothing.There was no flame.Evidently not a particle of gas was escaping through the rock."
"“什么都没有！”福特叫道，紧紧攥着他的拳头，那架势与其说是愤怒，还不如说是失望。","“Nothing!” cried Ford, clenching his fist with a gesture rather of anger than disappointment."
"哈里不禁叫了一声。","A cry escaped Harry."
"“怎么回事？”斯塔尔急忙问道。","“What’s the matter?” asked Starr quickly."
"“有人把片岩上的缝隙堵住了！”","“Someone has stopped up the cracks in the schist!”"
"“是真的吗？”老矿工叫道。","“Is that true?” exclaimed the old miner."
"“看，父亲！”哈里没有弄错。裂缝的堵塞物在灯光下清晰可见。那是不久前用石灰堵上的，岩石上还留下了一条长长的发白痕迹，拙劣地用煤尘掩盖着。","“Look, father!”Harry was not mistaken.The obstruction of the fissures was clearly visible by the light of the lamp.It had been recently done with lime, leaving on the rock a long whitish mark, badly concealed with coal dust."
"“就是他！”哈里惊叫道，“只会是他！”","“It’s he!” exclaimed Harry.“It can only be he!”"
"“他？”詹姆斯·斯塔尔讶异地重复道。","“He?” repeated James Starr in amazement."
"“是的！”年轻人答道，“那个在我们领地上出没的神秘人，我瞧见过他上百次却没能追上他——他就是那个作者，现在我们可以确定，是他企图阻扰您来见我父亲，斯塔尔先生，也是他最后在亚罗井的水平巷道里朝我们扔石头！啊！无需怀疑，一切都出自于那人之手！”","“Yes!” returned the young man, “that mysterious being who haunts our domain, for whom I have watched a hundred times without being able to get at him—the author, we may now be certain, of that letter which was intended to hinder you from coming to see my father, Mr. Starr, and who finally threw that stone at us in the gallery of the Yarrow shaft!Ah! there’s no doubt about it; there is a man’s hand in all that!”"
"哈里说得非常有力，使工程师立刻对此深信不疑。至于老工头，他也深信不疑。此外，在那儿，他们面前摆着一个不容质疑的事实——溢出大量煤气的缝隙就在前一天晚上被人堵住了。","Harry spoke with such energy that conviction came instantly and fully to the engineer’s mind.As to the old overman, he was already convinced.Besides, there they were in the presence of an undeniable fact—the stopping-up of cracks through which gas had escaped freely the night before."
"“拿起你的镐，哈里，”福特叫道，“骑到我肩上，我的孩子！我仍然很强壮，可以撑住你！”年轻人立即明白了。他的父亲倚靠在岩石上。哈里爬到他父亲的肩上，这样他就可以用他的镐够到那条裂缝线了。随后，他快速猛烈地敲击着裂缝。他们几乎马上就听见了一声轻微的声响，就像是香槟从瓶中溢出的时那样——那声响通常用词语“噗”来表达。","“Take your pick, Harry,” cried Ford; “mount on my shoulders, my lad!I am still strong enough to bear you!”The young man understood in an instant.His father propped himself up against the rock.Harry got upon his shoulders, so that with his pick he could reach the line of the fissure.Then with quick sharp blows he attacked it.Almost directly afterwards a slight sound was heard, like champagne escaping from a bottle—a sound commonly expressed by the word “puff.”"
"哈里再次拿着他的灯，举到开口处。从那儿发出了一声轻微的爆炸声，一小团红色的火焰在岩石上闪烁，火的外沿是蓝色的，就像一团鬼火。","Harry again seized his lamp, and held it to the opening.There was a slight report; and a little red flame, rather blue at its outline, flickered over the rock like a Will-o’-the-Wisp."
"哈里跳到地上。老工头抑制不住他的喜悦，抓住工程师的手叫道，“太好了！太好了！太好了！斯塔尔先生。甲烷燃了！矿脉就在那儿！”","Harry leaped to the ground, and the old overman, unable to contain his joy, grasped the engineer’s hands, exclaiming, “Hurrah!Hurrah!Hurrah!Mr. Starr.The fire-damp burns!The vein is there!”"
"第七章　新阿伯福伊尔","CHAPTER VII NEW ABERFOYLE"
"老工头的实验成功了。众所周知，甲烷只能在煤层中生成，因而，这里存在一条富含宝贵燃料的矿脉便是毋庸置疑的了。至于这条矿脉的规模和质量，日后一定能测出来。","The old overman’s experiment had succeeded.Firedamp, it is well known, is only generated in coal seams; therefore the existence of a vein of precious combustible could no longer be doubted.As to its size and quality, that must be determined later."
"“是的，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔想道，“在这个岩壁后有一片我们未能勘探到的石碳层。伤脑筋的是，我们得把矿上所有废弃了十年的设备都重新安装好。不要紧。我们找到了一条人们原以为已经枯竭了的矿脉，这一次它一定会被开采殆尽的！”","“Yes,” thought James Starr, “behind that wall lies a carboniferous bed, undiscovered by our soundings.It is vexatious that all the apparatus of the mine, deserted for ten years, must be set up anew.Never mind.We have found the vein which was thought to be exhausted, and this time it shall be worked to the end!”"
"“那么，斯塔尔先生，”福特问道，“您怎样看待我们的这一发现呢？烦您来这一趟，没错吧？您对这次的多查特矿井之行感到遗憾吗？”","“Well, Mr. Starr,” asked Ford, “what do you think of our discovery?Was I wrong to trouble you?Are you sorry to have paid this visit to the Dochart pit?”"
"“不，不，我的老朋友！”斯塔尔答道，“我们没有浪费时间，但是如果我们不立即返回村舍的话，那就是在浪费时间了。明天我们再来这儿。我们将用炸药把这个岩壁炸开。新的矿脉将呈现在我们面前。在一系列的勘探之后，如果煤层面积看起来很大的话，我将成立一个新的阿伯福伊尔公司，并将使老股东们感到十分满意。要不了三个月，第一批小型矿车将会满载煤炭从新矿脉里出来。”","“No, no, my old friend!” answered Starr.“We have not lost our time; but we shall be losing it now, if we do not return immediately to the cottage.To-morrow we will come back here.We will blast this wall with dynamite.We will lay open the new vein, and after a series of soundings, if the seam appears to be large, I will form a new Aberfoyle Company, to the great satisfaction of the old shareholders.Before three months have passed, the first corves full of coal will have been taken from the new vein.”"
"“说得好，先生！”西蒙·福特大叫道，“老煤矿将再次焕发青春，就如同一个再婚的寡妇一般！伴随着镐和鹤嘴锄的敲击、火药的爆炸、货车的穿梭、马匹的嘶叫声以及机器的嘎吱声，昔日的喧嚣即将开始！我一定会再看到这一切的！斯塔尔先生，我希望您可别认为我已经老得不能继续履行我的工头职责了，不会的，对吧？","“Well said, sir!” cried Simon Ford.“The old mine will grow young again, like a widow who remarries!The bustle of the old days will soon begin with the blows of the pick, and mattock, blasts of powder, rumbling of wagons, neighing of horses, creaking of machines!I shall see it all again!I hope, Mr. Starr, that you will not think me too old to résumé my duties of overman?”"
"“不会的，西蒙，真的不会！您比我结实多了，我的老朋友！”","“No, Simon, no indeed!You wear better than I do, my old friend!”"
"“那么，先生，您将仍是我们的管理者。希望新的开采工作能够持续好多年，到我死的时候，如果上帝庇佑它还没有开采殆尽，那就是给我最大的安慰了！”","“And, sir, you shall be our viewer again.May the new working last for many years, and pray Heaven I shall have the consolation of dying without seeing the end of it!”"
"老矿工满心欢喜。詹姆斯·斯塔尔也沉浸在喜悦之中，但他任由福特尽情表现出他俩的狂喜。唯独哈里一人沉思着。在发现新煤床的过程中接连发生的那些奇怪而又无法解释的状况，反复浮现在他的脑海里。这令他对未来感到不安。","The old miner was overflowing with joy.James Starr fully entered into it; but he let Ford rave for them both.Harry alone remained thoughtful.To his memory recurred the succession of singular, inexplicable circumstances attending the discovery of the new bed.It made him uneasy about the future."
"一个小时之后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的两个同伴回到了村舍里。晚餐时工程师胃口很好，满意地听着老工头陈述他所有的计划。若不是因为第二天的工作令他兴奋不已，他将会在这个极其安静的村舍里睡上一个从未有过的好觉。","An hour afterwards, James Starr and his two companions were back in the cottage.The engineer supped with good appetite, listening with satisfaction to all the plans unfolded by the old overman; and had it not been for his excitement about the next day’s work, he would never have slept better than in the perfect stillness of the cottage."
"第二天，吃了一顿丰盛的早餐之后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔、西蒙·福特、哈里甚至还有马奇沿着前一天的路线出发了。大家看上去就像普通的矿工一样。他们带着各种各样的工具和一些用来炸岩石的炸药。哈里拎着一盏很大的提灯，还带了一盏可以燃烧十二个小时的安全灯。这对应付来回路上的照明来说已是绰绰有余，包括开采所需的时间——如果有开采的可能的话。","The following day, after a substantial breakfast, James Starr, Simon Ford, Harry, and even Madge herself, took the road already traversed the day before.All looked like regular miners.They carried different tools, and some dynamite with which to blast the rock.Harry, besides a large lantern, took a safety lamp, which would burn for twelve hours.It was more than was necessary for the journey there and back, including the time for the working—supposing a working was possible."
"“开工！开工！”当队伍到了通道更远处的末端时，福特喊道，他还抓起一根铁撬挥动着。","“To work! to work!” shouted Ford, when the party reached the further end of the passage; and he grasped a heavy crowbar and brandished it."
"“等一会儿，”斯塔尔说道,“我们看看有没有发生什么变化，甲烷是否还是从裂缝里溢出。”","“Stop one instant,” said Starr.“Let us see if any change has taken place, and if the fire-damp still escapes through the crevices.”"
"“您说得对，斯塔尔先生，”哈里说道,“昨天堵住了裂缝的人今天可能会再把它堵住！”","“You are right, Mr. Starr,” said Harry.“Whoever stopped it up yesterday may have done it again to-day!”"
"马奇坐在一块岩石上，仔细观察着洞穴和那面即将被炸毁的岩壁。","Madge, seated on a rock, carefully observed the excavation, and the wall which was to be blasted."
"他们发现所有的东西都和他们昨天离开时一样。裂缝没有变化，碳化氢仍从中渗出，但量很少。不用怀疑，这是因为在前一天矿坑气找到了一条自由的通道。由于量很少，它无法和里面的空气形成一种爆炸混合物。因此，詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们能够安全地行事。此外，空气上升到多查特矿井的顶部，变得越来越纯净，并且弥漫在空气中的甲烷也没有多到能引起任何爆炸的程度。","It was found that everything was just as they left it.The crevices had undergone no alteration; the carburetted hydrogen still filtered through, though in a small stream, which was no doubt because it had had a free passage since the day before.As the quantity was so small, It could not have formed an explosive mixture with the air inside.James Starr and his companions could therefore proceed in security.Besides, the air grew purer by rising to the heights of the Dochart pit; and the fire-damp, spreading through the atmosphere, would not be strong enough to make any explosion."
"“那开工吧！”福特重复道。他娴熟地锤击岩石，岩石立马飞迸成碎片。这个裂缝就像矿脉中最常见的那样，主要由缀满砂岩和片岩的圆砾岩组成。詹姆斯·斯塔尔拾起一些碎片，仔细地检查着，希望从中发现煤的某种痕迹。","“To work, then!” repeated Ford; and soon the rock flew in splinters under his skillful blows.The break was chiefly composed of pudding-stone, interspersed with sandstone and schist, such as is most often met with between the coal veins.James Starr picked up some of the pieces, and examined them carefully, hoping to discover some trace of coal."
"斯塔尔选了一处可以钻洞的地方，哈里便迅速凿出洞来。一些炸药筒被塞进洞里。等那根涂了焦油的安全长火柴一放好，他们就在贴近地面的地方把它点燃了。然后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们往后退了一段距离。","Starr having chosen the place where the holes were to be drilled, they were rapidly bored by Harry.Some cartridges of dynamite were put into them.As soon as the long, tarred safety match was laid, it was lighted on a level with the ground.James Starr and his companions then went off to some distance."
"“噢！斯塔尔先生，”西蒙·福特说道，他很激动，也没想去掩饰他的激动，“从来没有，没有，我的这颗老心脏从没跳得这么快！我渴望能到达那条矿脉！”","“Oh!Mr. Starr,” said Simon Ford, a prey to agitation, which he did not attempt to conceal, “never, no, never has my old heart beaten so quick before!I am longing to get at the vein!”"
"“耐心点，西蒙！”工程师回答道,“您不会是想说，您认为会在那个岩脉后找到一个已经打开的通道吧？”","“Patience, Simon!” responded the engineer.“You don't mean to say that you think you are going to find a passage all ready open behind that dyke?”"
"“抱歉，先生，”老工头回答道，“我当然这样认为了！如果说我和哈里是凭运气发现了这个地方，难道好运不会继续吗？”","“Excuse me, sir,” answered the old overman; “but of course I think so!If there was good luck in the way Harry and I discovered this place, why shouldn't the good luck go on?”"
"在他说话时，炸药爆炸了。一声雷鸣般的响声在迷宫般的地下水平巷道中扩散开来。斯塔尔、马奇、哈里以及西蒙·福特立即朝洞口冲去。","As he spoke, came the explosion.A sound as of thunder rolled through the labyrinth of subterranean galleries.Starr, Madge, Harry, and Simon Ford hastened towards the spot."
"“斯塔尔先生！斯塔尔先生！”工头叫喊道,“瞧！门被炸开了！”","“Mr. Starr!Mr. Starr!” shouted the overman.“Look! the door is broken open!”"
"出现的洞穴证实了福特的比喻，它的深度无法估量。哈里正打算跳进洞里，却被工程师拉住了，尽管他看到这个洞也极其惊讶。“等里面的空气变纯净些。”他说道。","Ford’s comparison was justified by the appearance of an excavation, the depth of which could not be calculated.Harry was about to spring through the opening; but the engineer, though excessively surprised to find this cavity, held him back.“Allow time for the air in there to get pure,” said he."
"“是的！当心里面的浊气！” 西蒙说道。","“Yes! beware of the foul air!” said Simon."
"他们焦急地等了一刻钟。接着，他们把提灯牢牢地绑在一根棍子的末端，然后伸进洞里。提灯继续燃烧着，亮度没变。“哈里，现在你可以进去了，”斯塔尔说道，“我们跟着你。”","A quarter of an hour was passed in anxious waiting.The lantern was then fastened to the end of a stick, and introduced into the cave, where it continued to burn with unaltered brilliancy.“Now then, Harry, go,” said Starr, “and we will follow you.”"
"炸药炸开的那个洞口足以让一个人穿过。哈里手里拎着灯，毫不犹豫地走进洞里，消失在黑暗中。他的父亲、母亲以及詹姆斯·斯塔尔静静地等待着。一分钟过去了——对他们而言似乎远远不止一分钟。哈里既没有重新出现，也没有喊叫。詹姆斯·斯塔尔紧紧地盯着洞口，他甚至无法看见本该照亮黑暗洞穴的灯光。","The opening made by the dynamite was sufficiently large to allow a man to pass through.Harry, lamp in hand, entered unhesitatingly, and disappeared in the darkness.His father, mother, and James Starr waited in silence.A minute—which seemed to them much longer—passed.Harry did not reappear, did not call.Gazing into the opening, James Starr could not even see the light of his lamp, which ought to have illuminated the dark cavern."
"是哈里脚下的地面突然塌陷了？还是这个年轻的矿工掉进了某个裂缝里？亦或是他的声音没能传到他同伴们的耳朵里？","Had the ground suddenly given way under Harry’s feet?Had the young miner fallen into some crevice?Could his voice no longer reach his companions?"
"老工头听不进他们的劝阻，正打算进入洞口。这时，一道光亮出现了，刚开始很昏暗，但慢慢地越来越亮了。接着就听见了哈里的喊声，“快来，斯塔尔先生！快来，父亲！通往新阿伯福伊尔的路通了！”","The old overman, dead to their remonstrances, was about to enter the opening, when a light appeared, dim at first, but gradually growing brighter, and Harry’s voice was heard shouting, “Come, Mr. Starr! come, father!The road to New Aberfoyle is open!”"
"如果工程师们凭借某种超人的力量能举起那块支撑着斯特林郡、邓巴郡和伦弗鲁郡的湖泊、河流、港湾和土地的那部分1000英尺厚的陆地外壳，他们将会在那个巨大的盖子下面发现一个极大的洞穴。在这个世界上只有一个地方可以与之相比——肯塔基州著名的马默斯洞穴。这个洞穴由几百个大小不一、形状各异的部分组成。它可被称作是一个蜂箱，有无数随意排放的巢室，然而这却是一个尺寸巨大的蜂箱，居住在此的不是蜜蜂，而是地质时期的所有鱼龙、大地懒以及翼手龙。","If, by some superhuman power, engineers could have raised in a block, a thousand feet thick, all that portion of the terrestrial crust which supports the lakes, rivers, gulfs, and territories of the counties of Stirling, Dumbarton, and Renfrew, they would have found, under that enormous lid, an immense excavation, to which but one other in the world can be compared—the celebrated Mammoth caves of Kentucky.This excavation was composed of several hundred divisions of all sizes and shapes.It might be called a hive with numberless ranges of cells, capriciously arranged, but a hive on a vast scale, and which, instead of bees, might have lodged all the ichthyosauri, megatheriums, and ptero-dactyles of the geological epoch."
"这些迷宫般的水平巷道，有些比最高大的大教堂还高，有些则像狭窄而曲折的回廊——一些沿着水平方向排开，另一些则位于斜坡上或是向各个方向倾斜而列——洞穴彼此相连，人们能在其间自由穿行。","A labyrinth of galleries, some higher than the most lofty cathedrals, others like cloisters, narrow and winding—these following a horizontal line, those on an incline or running obliquely in all directions—connected the caverns and allowed free communication between them."
"这些由砂岩和片岩组成的柱子支撑着各式各样弧形的拱顶、通道间巨大的岩壁和中生代地层中的教堂中殿。但是，这些无用的岩层间紧压着富有价值的煤矿脉，就像是这个新煤矿的黑色血液在其错综复杂的脉络里流淌一样。这片矿南北延伸四十英里，甚至延伸到了喀里多尼亚运河底部。这个煤床的重要性只有到勘探之后才能被估量出来，但一定会超过加的夫和纽卡斯尔的重要性。","The pillars sustaining the vaulted roofs, whose curves allowed of every style, the massive walls between the passages, the naves themselves in this layer of secondary formation, were composed of sandstone and schistous rocks.But tightly packed between these useless strata ran valuable veins of coal, as if the black blood of this strange mine had circulated through their tangled network.These fields extended forty miles north and south, and stretched even under the Caledonian Canal.The importance of this bed could not be calculated until after soundings, but it would certainly surpass those of Cardiff and Newcastle."
"我们可以补充的是，中生代地层的奇特构造非常有利于煤矿的开采；由于地质时期无从解释的矿物质撤退，当大量物质固化时，大自然已经繁衍了新阿伯福伊尔的水平巷道和隧道。","We may add that the working of this mine would be singularly facilitated by the fantastic dispositions of the secondary earths; for by an unaccountable retreat of the mineral matter at the geological epoch, when the mass was solidifying, nature had already multiplied the galleries and tunnels of New Aberfoyle."
"是啊，只有大自然！起初，人们可能认为是遭遗弃了数个世纪的某些工程又被重新发现了。没有这种事。没人会舍弃这笔财富。人类的白蚁从未啃噬过苏格兰地下的这块土地，是大自然自身造就了这一切。然而，我们需要重复的是，除了著名的马默斯洞穴，没有任何洞穴能与之相比。它长达二十多英里，有二百二十六条大道、十一个湖泊、七条河流、八个大瀑布、三十二口深不可测的井和五十七个穹顶，其中一些穹顶有四百五十多英尺高。就像这些洞穴一样，新阿伯福伊尔不是人类的杰作，而是造物主的杰作。","Yes, nature alone!It might at first have been supposed that some works abandoned for centuries had been discovered afresh.Nothing of the sort.No one would have deserted such riches.Human termites had never gnawed away this part of the Scottish subsoil; nature herself had done it all.But, we repeat, it could be compared to nothing but the celebrated Mammoth caves, which, in an extent of more than twenty miles, contain two hundred and twenty-six avenues, eleven lakes, seven rivers, eight cataracts, thirty-two unfathomable wells, and fifty-seven domes, some of which are more than four hundred and fifty feet in height.Like these caves, New Aberfoyle was not the work of men, but the work of the Creator."
"这就是有着无与伦比的财富的新领地，完全是由老工头一人发现了它。他十年来居住在废弃的煤矿里，异常执着地进行搜寻，凭着坚定的信念和非凡的采矿直觉——所有这些品质共同促成了老矿工的成功，这也正是其他人的失败之处。为什么在开采的最后几年里，詹姆斯·斯塔尔指导下的勘探工作恰好就停在了那个界限上，就停在了新煤矿的边界上呢？那只是偶然，这种偶然性在这类搜寻中起着很大的作用。","Such was this new domain, of matchless wealth, the discovery of which belonged entirely to the old overman.Ten years’ sojourn in the deserted mine, an uncommon pertinacity in research, perfect faith, sustained by a marvelous mining instinct—all these qualities together led him to succeed where so many others had failed.Why had the soundings made under the direction of James Starr during the last years of the working stopped just at that limit, on the very frontier of the new mine?That was all chance, which takes great part in researches of this kind."
"无论怎样，在苏格兰的地下有一个可以被称作地下郡的地方，那里可以居住，仅仅需要阳光或是由一种特殊星球所发出的光亮。","However that might be, there was, under the Scottish subsoil, what might be called a subterranean county, which, to be habitable, needed only the rays of the sun, or, for want of that, the light of a special planet."
"水汇集在各个洼地，形成巨大的水塘或是湖泊，它们比位于其上方的卡特琳湖还要大。当然，这些湖泊里的水没有水流或潮汐，没有古城堡倒映在湖面，没有桦树或橡树摇曳在岸边。虽然没有微风在这些幽深的湖泊如镜般的湖面上吹起涟漪，它们却在某种电器发出的星光下魅力依旧。同时，在一条条水道的连接下，湖泊使这块奇特领地的地貌变得更为完整。","Water had collected in various hollows, forming vast ponds, or rather lakes larger than Loch Katrine, lying just above them.Of course the waters of these lakes had no movement of currents or tides; no old castle was reflected there; no birch or oak trees waved on their banks.And yet these deep lakes, whose mirror-like surface was never ruffled by a breeze, would not be without charm by the light of some electric star, and, connected by a string of canals, would well complete the geography of this strange domain."
"尽管这地方不适合种植任何蔬菜，但却适合所有人居住。但谁又知道气温恒定的阿伯福伊尔煤矿深处，以及纽卡斯尔、阿洛厄或加的夫煤矿的深处——当它们被采掘殆尽时——大不列颠的贫困阶级会在某天找到这里，并把这儿当作避难所呢？","Although unfit for any vegetable production, the place could be inhabited by a whole population.And who knows but that in this steady temperature, in the depths of the mines of Aberfoyle, as well as in those of Newcastle, Alloa, or Cardiff—when their contents shall have been exhausted—who knows but that the poorer classes of Great Britain will some day find a refuge?"
"第八章　勘探","CHAPTER VIII EXPLORING"
"听到哈里的叫喊，詹姆斯·斯塔尔、马奇和西蒙·福特便进入了连接多查特矿井与新煤矿的狭窄洞口。他们发现自己处在一个相当宽大的水平巷道入口处。人们也许真会以为这条水平巷道是由人手工凿出的，是为开采新脉矿而用镐和鹤嘴锄挖空的。勘探者们怀疑是否是一次奇特的机遇将他们带到了某个古老的煤矿，甚至郡里最年长的矿工都不知道它的存在。","At Harry’s call, James Starr, Madge, and Simon Ford entered through the narrow orifice which put the Dochart pit in communication with the new mine.They found themselves at the beginning of a tolerably wide gallery.One might well believe that it had been pierced by the hand of man, that the pick and mattock had emptied it in the working of a new vein.The explorers question whether, by a strange chance, they had not been transported into some ancient mine, of the existence of which even the oldest miners in the county had ever known."
"不是！那只是地质层在中生代地层形成过程中留下的一条通道。也许从前某条湍流流经此处，但如今这儿就像几千英尺下被凿开的花岗岩表层一样干燥。同时，空气自由流通，表明某些天然的洞口将通道和外面的大气相连接。","No!It was merely that the geological layers had left this passage when the secondary earths were in course of formation.Perhaps some torrent had formerly dashed through it; but now it was as dry as if it had been cut some thousand feet lower, through granite rocks.At the same time, the air circulated freely, which showed that certain natural vents placed it in communication with the exterior atmosphere."
"工程师的观察是正确的，很明显，新煤矿的通风情况很好应付。至于不久前从片岩中溢出的甲烷，就像被装进了一个口袋里，如今也空了。可以肯定的是，水平巷道的大气中绝无甲烷。但是，哈里还是很谨慎地仅带了安全灯，它可以保证十二小时的照明。","This observation, made by the engineer, was correct, and it was evident that the ventilation of the new mine would be easily managed.As to the fire-damp which had lately filtered through the schist, it seemed to have been contained in a pocket now empty, and it was certain that the atmosphere of the gallery was quite free from it.However, Harry prudently carried only the safety lamp, which would insure light for twelve hours."
"现在詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们感到非常高兴。他们所有的愿望都实现了。他们四周除了煤什么都没有。一种情感令他们保持沉默，甚至西蒙·福特也克制着自己。能表达他欣喜之情的不是冗长的言辞，而是简短的话语。","James Starr and his companions now felt perfectly happy.All their wishes were satisfied.There was nothing but coal around them.A sort of emotion kept them silent; even Simon Ford restrained himself.His joy overflowed, not in long phrases, but in short ejaculations."
"也许冒险深入这个地下洞穴很鲁莽。呸！他们从未考虑过将如何返回。","It was perhaps imprudent to venture so far into the crypt.Pooh! they never thought of how they were to get back."
"水平巷道很通畅，并不是很曲折。他们既未遇见泄出的有毒气体，也未遇见任何深坑阻拦道路。没有理由停下来一个小时。尽管没有任何迹象为他们指明这条未知隧道的确切方向，詹姆斯·斯塔尔、马奇、哈里以及西蒙·福特还是继续往前走着。","The gallery was practicable, not very winding.They met with no noxious exhalations, nor did any chasm bar the path.There was no reason for stopping for a whole hour; James Starr, Madge, Harry, and Simon Ford walked on, though there was nothing to show them what was the exact direction of this unknown tunnel."
"毋庸置疑，如果不是那条他们进入煤矿后便一直沿着它走的大路突然到了尽头，他们还会往前走得更远。","And they would no doubt have gone farther still, if they had not suddenly come to the end of the wide road which they had followed since their entrance into the mine."
"水平巷道的尽头是一个巨大的洞穴，高度和深度都无法测量。洞穴的拱顶在什么高度——对面的岩壁距此有多远——黑暗完全掩盖了这一切；但借着灯光，勘探者们能发现洞穴的穹顶下是一片宽阔的静水——水塘或湖泊——它如画般的石岸浸没在黑暗中。","The gallery ended in an enormous cavern, neither the height nor depth of which could be calculated.At what altitude arched the roof of this excavation—at what distance was its opposite wall—the darkness totally concealed; but by the light of the lamp the explorers could discover that its dome covered a vast extent of still water—pond or lake—whose picturesque rocky banks were lost in obscurity."
"“停下！”福特大叫道，突然停下了，“再往前一步，我们也许会掉进某个深不可测的矿井里。”","“Halt!” exclaimed Ford, stopping suddenly.“Another step, and perhaps we shall fall into some fathomless pit.”"
"“那么我们休息片刻，我的朋友们，”工程师答道，“还有，我们该考虑返回村舍了。”","“Let us rest awhile, then, my friends,” returned the engineer.“Besides, we ought to be thinking of returning to the cottage.”"
"“我们的灯还能亮十小时，先生。”哈里说道。","“Our lamp will give light for another ten hours, sir,” said Harry."
"“好吧，我们停一下，”斯塔尔回答道，“我承认我的两条腿需要休息一会儿了。您呢，马奇，走了这么远，难道您不觉得累吗？”","“Well, let us make a halt,” replied Starr; “I confess my legs have need of a rest.And you, Madge, don’t you feel tired after so long a walk?”"
"“不是太累，斯塔尔先生，”这个健壮的苏格兰妇女答道，“我们已经习惯了整天在旧阿伯福伊尔煤矿里进行勘探。”","“Not over much, Mr. Starr,” replied the sturdy Scotchwoman; “we have been accustomed to explore the old Aberfoyle mine for whole days together.”"
"“累？不可能！”西蒙·福特打岔道，“如果有必要，马奇能走这十倍远的路。但是，斯塔尔先生，我还想问一次，麻烦您前来听我的情报是否不虚此行？您尽管说不，斯塔尔先生，您尽管说不！”","“Tired? nonsense!” interrupted Simon Ford; “Madge could go ten times as far, if necessary.But once more, Mr. Starr, wasn't my communication worth your trouble in coming to hear it?Just dare to say no, Mr. Starr, dare to say no!”"
"“行了，我的老朋友，我很久没有这么高兴了！”工程师回答道，“这个煤矿非同寻常，我们勘探的一小部分似乎表明它的范围很广阔，至少在长度上是如此。”","“Well, my old friend, I haven't felt so happy for a long while!” replied the engineer; “the small part of this marvelous mine that we have explored seems to show that its extent is very considerable, at least in length.”"
"“在广度和深度上也一样，斯塔尔先生！”西蒙·福特回答道。","“In width and in depth, too, Mr. Starr!” returned Simon Ford."
"“我们日后会知道的。”","“That we shall know later.”"
"“我能对此负责！相信一个老矿工的直觉吧！我的直觉还未曾欺骗过我！”","“And I can answer for it!Trust to the instinct of an old miner!It has never deceived me!”"
"我愿意相信你，西蒙。”工程师微笑着答道，“从这次短期勘探中我判断，我们拥有了将会持续数个世纪的可开采元素！” ","“I wish to believe you, Simon,” replied the engineer, smiling.“As far as I can judge from this short exploration, we possess the elements of a working which will last for centuries!”"
"“数个世纪！”西蒙·福特惊叫道，“我相信您，先生！一千多年后，最后一块煤才会从我们的新矿中运出！”","“Centuries!” exclaimed Simon Ford; “I believe you, sir!A thousand years and more will pass before the last bit of coal is taken out of our new mine!”"
"“是上苍赋予的！”斯塔尔回答道，“露在这些岩壁外的煤质量如何？”","“Heaven grant it!” returned Starr.“As to the quality of the coal which crops out of these walls?”"
"“好极了！斯塔尔先生，好极了！”福特答道，“只要您亲自看看这个！”","“Superb!Mr. Starr, superb!” answered Ford; “just look at it yourself!”"
"说着，他用锄凿下一块黑色的岩石。","And so saying, with his pick he struck off a fragment of the black rock."
"“瞧！瞧！”他重复道，把岩石凑近到灯下，“这块煤的表面闪着光！我们这儿的是肥煤，富含沥青物质。看看它分成小块会怎么样，几乎没有煤尘！啊，斯塔尔先生！二十年过去了，终于有了块可以与斯旺西和加的夫的煤层一比高下的煤层！好吧，司炉们仍将为此争吵不休，而且如果将煤从矿中采出的花费很小，它便不会以较低的价格对外出售了。”","“Look! look!” he repeated, holding it close to his lamp; “the surface of this piece of coal is shining!We have here fat coal, rich in bituminous matter; and see how it comes in pieces, almost without dust!Ah, Mr. Starr!Twenty years ago this seam would have entered into a strong competition with Swansea and Cardiff!Well, stokers will quarrel for it still, and if it costs little to extract it from the mine, it will not sell at a less price outside.”"
"“的确，”马奇说道，她拿过那块煤以一副鉴定家的神情检查着，“这是块优质煤。带回家，西蒙，把它带回村舍！我想用这第一块煤烧水。”","“Indeed,” said Madge, who had taken the fragment of coal and was examining it with the air of a connoisseur; “that’s good quality of coal.Carry it home, Simon, carry it back to the cottage!I want this first piece of coal to burn under our kettle.”"
"“说得好，老婆！”老工头回答道，“你会看到我没错。”","“Well said, wife!” answered the old overman, “and you shall see that I am not mistaken.”"
"“斯塔尔先生，”哈里问道，“您知道我们进入新煤矿后就一直沿着走的这条长通道可能通往哪儿吗？”","“Mr. Starr,” asked Harry, “have you any idea of the probable direction of this long passage which we have been following since our entrance into the new mine?”"
"“不知道，小伙子，”工程师回答道，“借助指南针我也许能找到它大致的方位，但没有指南针，我在这儿就像身处远海里的水手一样，一名身陷迷雾、没有太阳来确定方位的水手。”","“No, my lad,” replied the engineer; “with a compass I could perhaps find out its general bearing; but without a compass I am here like a sailor in open sea, in the midst of fogs, when there is no sun by which to calculate his position.”"
"“毋庸置疑，斯塔尔先生，”福特答道，“但请别将我们的处境与水手的那种处境相比，他们的脚下处处是并且永远都是深渊！我们是在坚固的土地上，从不需要担心会沉没。”","“No doubt, Mr. Starr,” replied Ford; “but pray don’t compare our position with that of the sailor, who has everywhere and always an abyss under his feet!We are on firm ground here, and need never be afraid of foundering.”"
"“我不会笑话您，老西蒙，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，“我更不曾想过要用一个不恰当的比较来开玩笑贬低新阿伯福伊尔煤矿！我只是想说一件事，那就是我们不知道我们在哪儿。”","“I won’t tease you, then, old Simon,” answered James Starr.“Far be it from me even in jest to depreciate the New Aberfoyle mine by an unjust comparison!I only meant to say one thing, and that is that we don't know where we are.”"
"“我们在斯特林郡的地下，斯塔尔先生，”西蒙·福特回答道，“这点我能断定，就像——”","“We are in the subsoil of the county of Stirling, Mr. Starr,” replied Simon Ford; “and that I assert as if—” "
"“听！”哈里说道，打断了老人的话。大家听着，就像年轻的矿工那样。他的耳朵非常灵敏，听到了一种低沉的声音，像是远处的低语声。他的同伴们不一会儿也听到了那声音。声音在他们头顶上方起伏，尽管很微弱，但他们还是能清楚地听到那持续不断、忽强忽弱的声音。","“Listen!” said Harry, interrupting the old man.All listened, as the young miner was doing.His ears, which were very sharp, had caught a dull sound, like a distant murmur.His companions were not long in hearing it themselves.It was above their heads, a sort of rolling sound, in which though it was so feeble, the successive crescendo and diminuendo could be distinctly heard."
"四个人在那儿站了几分钟，竖着耳朵听着，一个字都没说。西蒙·福特突然惊叫道：“啊，我宣布！是车皮已经在新阿伯福伊尔的轨道上跑起来了？”","All four stood for some minutes, their ears on the stretch, without uttering a word.All at once Simon Ford exclaimed, “Well, I declare!Are trucks already running on the rails of New Aberfoyle?”"
"“父亲，”哈里回答道，“在我听来，这声音就像海浪翻滚在海岸上所发出的声音。”","“Father,” replied Harry, “it sounds to me just like the noise made by waves rolling on the sea shore.”"
"“我们不会是在海底吧！”老工头叫嚷道。","“We can’t be under the sea though!” cried the old overman."
"“不可能，”工程师说道，“但是，我们倒是有可能在卡特琳湖的湖床下。”","“No,” said the engineer, “but it is not impossible that we should be under Loch Katrine.”"
"“如果能够听到水的声音，那么这儿的顶就不会很厚。”","“The roof cannot have much thickness just here, if the noise of the water is perceptible.”"
"“的确不厚，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔答道，“这也是这个洞穴如此巨大的原因所在。”","“Very little indeed,” answered James Starr, “and that is the reason this cavern is so huge.”"
"“您肯定是对的，斯塔尔先生，”哈里说道。","“You must be right, Mr. Starr,” said Harry."
"“此外，外面的天气很糟糕，”斯塔尔继续说道，“湖水一定就像福斯河的河水一样汹涌。”","“Besides, the weather is so bad outside,” resumed Starr, “that the waters of the loch must be as rough as those of the Firth of Forth.”"
"“好吧！就算是这样又有什么关系呢？”西蒙·福特说道，“煤层不会更糟了，因为它是在湖下。这并不是第一次在大洋底下找到煤！当我们不得不在喀里多尼亚运河底部开采时，哪儿会有危害呢？”","“Well! what does it matter after all?” returned Simon Ford; “the seam won’t be any the worse because it is under a loch.It would not be the first time that coal has been looked for under the very bed of the ocean!When we have to work under the bottom of the Caledonian Canal, where will be the harm?”"
"“说得好，西蒙，”工程师叫道，他看着热忱的老工头忍不住微笑起来，“我们就在这海水下挖壕沟吧！让我们将大西洋的底部凿得像个过滤器，用我们的镐凿穿大洋，去与美国的弟兄们会合！如有必要，让我们挖到地球中心，挖下最后一片煤。”","“Well said, Simon,” cried the engineer, who could not restrain a smile at the overman’s enthusiasm; “let us cut our trenches under the waters of the sea!Let us bore the bed of the Atlantic like a strainer; let us with our picks join our brethren of the United States through the subsoil of the ocean! let us dig into the center of the globe if necessary, to tear out the last scrap of coal.”"
"“您在开玩笑吗，斯塔尔先生？”福特问道，带着一种高兴却又有一丝怀疑的表情。","“Are you joking, Mr. Starr?” asked Ford, with a pleased but slightly suspicious look."
"“我在开玩笑吗，老伙计？没有！您是如此兴奋，我也跟着兴奋起来，认为没什么不可能的了！行了，让我们回到已经足够美好的现实中吧。把我们的镐都留在这儿，我们改日可以在这儿找到它们。我们回村舍吧。”","“I joking, old man? no! but you are so enthusiastic that you carry me away into the regions of impossibility!Come, let us return to the reality, which is sufficiently beautiful; leave our picks here, where we may find them another day, and let’s take the road back to the cottage.”"
"现在没有任何事情可做了。不久，工程师会领着一伙带着灯和所有必需工具的矿工再来到这里。他们来勘探新阿伯福伊尔。现在是返回多查特矿井的时候了。路很好走，水平巷道几乎直直地穿过岩石通往被炸药炸开的那个洞口，因而他们无需担心会迷路。","Nothing more could be done for the time.Later, the engineer, accompanied by a brigade of miners, supplied with lamps and all necessary tools, would résumé.The exploration of New Aberfoyle.It was now time to return to the Dochart pit.The road was easy, the gallery running nearly straight through the rock up to the orifice opened by the dynamite, so there was no fear of their losing themselves."
"但正当詹姆斯·斯塔尔朝那条水平巷道走去时，西蒙·福特叫住了他。","But as James Starr was proceeding towards the gallery Simon Ford stopped him."
"“斯塔尔先生，”他说道，“您看看这个巨大的洞穴，这个地下湖，湖水浸没了我们脚下的湖岸，您看见了吗？嗯！我打算搬到这个地方来住，我会在这儿盖一处新的村舍。如果某些勇敢的同伴们能和我一样做的话，那么要不了一年，在我们古老英国的内部就将会有不止一个城镇。”","“Mr. Starr,” said he, “you see this immense cavern, this subterranean lake, whose waters bathe this strand at our feet?Well! it is to this place I mean to change my dwelling, here I will build a new cottage, and if some brave fellows will follow my example, before a year is over there will be one town more inside old England.”"
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔笑着对福特的计划表示了赞同，握了握他的手。他们三人走在马奇前面，重回到水平巷道里，走在回多查特矿井的路上。头一英里路上什么都没有发生。哈里走在最前面，将灯举过他的头顶。他沿着主水平巷道小心翼翼地走着，一次也没有拐进那些向左向右延伸开去的窄隧道里。和来时的路一样，回去的路似乎也很好走。就在这时，一件意想不到的事情发生了，这让勘探者们的处境极其危险。","James Starr, smiling approval of Ford’s plans, pressed his hand, and all three, preceding Madge, re-entered the gallery, on their way back to the Dochart pit.For the first mile no incident occurred.Harry walked first, holding his lamp above his head.He carefully followed the principal gallery, without ever turning aside into the narrow tunnels which radiated to the right and left.It seemed as if the returning was to be accomplished as easily as the going, when an unexpected accident occurred which rendered the situation of the explorers very serious."
"在哈里举起灯的瞬间，一阵急促的气流袭来，像是由隐形的翅膀扇动产生的。灯从他手中掉了下来，落在岩石地面上，摔成了碎片。","Just at a moment when Harry was raising his lamp there came a rush of air, as if caused by the flapping of invisible wings.The lamp escaped from his hands, fell on the rocky ground, and was broken to pieces."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们突然间陷入彻底的黑暗中。所有灯油都洒了，无法再用了。“嗨，哈里，”他父亲叫嚷道，“你想让我们在回村舍的路上都摔断脖子吗？”","James Starr and his companions were suddenly plunged in absolute darkness.All the oil of the lamp was spilt, and it was of no further use.“Well, Harry,” cried his father, “do you want us all to break our necks on the way back to the cottage?”"
"哈里没回答。他琢磨着他是否该怀疑这次事件是出自一个神秘人物之手？在这深处是否可能存在一个敌人，其令人费解的敌意会不会在某天带来重大麻烦？是有人有意要护卫这块新煤矿，所以反对任何人来进行开采吗？实际上，这看似荒谬，然而事实本身已不辩自明了，一件件事情加在一起已经将简单的假设变成了确定的事实。","Harry did not answer.He wondered if he ought to suspect the hand of a mysterious being in this last accident?Could there possibly exist in these depths an enemy whose unaccountable antagonism would one day create serious difficulties?Had someone an interest in defending the new coal field against any attempt at working it?In truth that seemed absurd, yet the facts spoke for themselves, and they accumulated in such a way as to change simple presumptions into certainties."
"与此同时，勘探者们的处境已相当糟糕。现在他们身陷一片漆黑之中，仍不得不沿着通向多查特矿井的通道行走了近五英里。他们还得行走一个小时才能到达村舍。","In the meantime the explorers’ situation was bad enough.They had now, in the midst of black darkness, to follow the passage leading to the Dochart pit for nearly five miles.There they would still have an hour’s walk before reaching the cottage."
"“继续走吧，”西蒙·福特说道，“我们没时间可浪费。我们必须摸索着前行，就像盲人一样。我们不必担心会迷路。一路上的隧道只不过就像那些鼹鼠丘上的洞穴，只要我们沿着主水平巷道走，一定会到达进来时的那个洞口。之后就是旧煤矿了。我们了解那儿，我和哈里已不是第一次身陷这样的黑暗之中了。此外，我们在那儿会找到我们留下的灯。那么出发吧！哈里，开路。斯塔尔先生，跟着他。马奇，接下来是你，我来殿后。最重要的是，我们不能分散了。”","“Come along,” said Simon Ford.“We have no time to lose.We must grope our way along, like blind men.There’s no fear of losing our way.The tunnels which open off our road are only just like those in a molehill, and by following the chief gallery we shall of course reach the opening we got in at.After that, it is the old mine.We know that, and it won’t be the first time that Harry and I have found ourselves therein the dark.Besides, there we shall find the lamps that we left.Forward then!Harry, go first.Mr. Starr, follow him.Madge, you go next, and I will bring up the rear.Above everything, don’t let us get separated.”"
"一切遵从老工头的指示。正如他说的，只要小心地摸索，他们就不会迷路。只需用手来代替眼睛，并相信他们的直觉。这种直觉已成了西蒙·福特和他儿子的又一本能。","All complied with the old overman’s instructions.As he said, by groping carefully, they could not mistake the way.It was only necessary to make the hands take the place of the eyes, and to trust to their instinct, which had with Simon Ford and his son become a second nature."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们按排好的顺序往前走。他们没有说话，但这并不是说他们没有思考。显然，他们遇到了一个对手。但他是谁？他们将如何防备这些神秘预谋的袭击呢？这些令人不安的想法涌入他们的脑海。然而，此刻不是泄气的时候。","James Starr and his companions walked on in the order agreed.They did not speak, but it was not for want of thinking.It became evident that they had an adversary.But what was he, and how were they to defend themselves against these mysteriously-prepared attacks?These disquieting ideas crowded into their brains.However, this was not the moment to get discouraged."
"哈里伸开他的手臂，从通道一边的岩壁摸索到另一边，迈着坚定的步伐前进。如果出现了一个裂缝或侧孔，他能用他的手感觉出来那不是主道，因为不是裂缝太浅就是侧口太窄，因而，他总能走在正确的路上。","Harry, his arms extended, advanced with a firm step, touching first one and then the other side of the passage.If a cleft or side opening presented itself, he felt with his hand that it was not the main way, either the cleft was too shallow, or the opening too narrow, and he thus kept in the right road."
"在眼睛几乎看不见一点光线的黑暗中，这段艰难的回程持续了两个小时。估摸一下时间，从他们开始出发算起，考虑到走得并不快，斯塔尔估计他和他的同伴们离洞口很近了。的确，哈里随即停了下来。","In darkness through which the eye could not in the slightest degree pierce, this difficult return lasted two hours.By reckoning the time since they started, taking into consideration that the walking had not been rapid, Starr calculated that he and his companions were near the opening.In fact, almost immediately, Harry stopped."
"“我们到水平巷道尽头了吗？”西蒙·福特问道。","“Have we got to the end of the gallery?” asked Simon Ford."
"“是的，”年轻的矿工回答道。","“Yes,” answered the young miner."
"“好的！你找到连接新阿伯福伊尔和多查特矿井的那个洞口了吗？”","“Well! have you not found the hole which connects New Aberfoyle with the Dochart pit?”"
"“没有。”哈里说道，他急躁地用手摸索着，除了一面坚硬的岩壁外什么也没摸到。","“No.” replied Harry, whose impatient hands met with nothing but a solid wall."
"老工头走上前亲自去摸着那块片岩。他不禁大叫了一声。","The old overman stepped forward, and himself felt the schistous rock.A cry escaped him."
"要么是勘探者们在回程中偏离了正确的道路，要么是岩壁上被炸药炸开的窄洞在不久前被堵住了。詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们被困在了新阿伯福伊尔。","Either the explorers had strayed from the right path on their return, or the narrow orifice, broken in the rock by the dynamite, had been recently stopped up.James Starr and his companions were prisoners in New Aberfoyle."
"第九章　火焰少女","CHAPTER IX THE FIRE-MAIDENS"
"上述事件发生一星期后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔的朋友们变得非常焦急。工程师消失了，没有任何理由来解释他的失踪。通过询问他的仆人，他们得知他是在格兰顿码头上的船。但从那以后，再没有詹姆斯·斯塔尔的踪迹了。西蒙·福特信中要求他保密，他便没有提及任何有关他前往阿伯福伊尔煤矿的事。","A week after the events just related had taken place, James Starr’s friends had become very anxious.The engineer had disappeared, and no reason could be brought forward to explain his absence.They learnt, by questioning his servant, that he had embarked at Granton Pier.But from that time there were no traces of James Starr.Simon Ford’s letter had requested secrecy, and he had said nothing of his departure for the Aberfoyle mines."
"因此，在爱丁堡，人们无不都在谈论着工程师的离奇失踪。“皇家协会”的主席W.埃尔菲斯顿爵士与他的同事们谈论着詹姆斯·斯塔尔寄给他的一封信，信中斯塔尔请求协会谅解他将无法出席协会的下一次会议。另有两三个人拿出了相似的信件。但尽管这些信件证明了斯塔尔已离开爱丁堡——这点之前早已知道——却丝毫不能说明他现在怎么样了。现在，就斯塔尔这样一个人来说，他平时很少失踪很长时间，因此，他的这次失踪自然一开始便引起了人们的惊讶，而后便是焦虑。","Therefore in Edinburgh nothing was talked of but the unaccountable absence of the engineer.Sir W. Elphiston, the President of the Royal Institution, communicated to his colleagues a letter which James Starr had sent him, excusing himself from being present at the next meeting of the society.Two or three others produced similar letters.But though these documents proved that Starr had left Edinburgh—which was known before—they threw no light on what had become of him.Now, on the part of such a man, this prolonged absence, so contrary to his usual habits, naturally first caused surprise, and then anxiety."
"英国的核心报纸上刊登了一条有关工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔的启事，描述了他的外貌并指出了他离开爱丁堡的日期。人们现在只有等待了。时间在人们的极度焦虑中流逝。英格兰的科学界倾向于相信他们最优秀的成员之一肯定已经消失了。与此同时，当许多人都关心着詹姆斯·斯塔尔时，也有人同样担忧着哈里·福特。不过，老工头的儿子并未引起公众的关注，只是破坏了杰克·瑞安一贯的愉悦心情。","A notice was inserted in the principal newspapers of the United Kingdom relative to the engineer James Starr, giving a description of him and the date on which he left Edinburgh; nothing more could be done but to wait.The time passed in great anxiety.The scientific world of England was inclined to believe that one of its most distinguished members had positively disappeared.At the same time, when so many people were thinking about James Starr, Harry Ford was the subject of no less anxiety.Only, instead of occupying public attention, the son of the old overman was the cause of trouble alone to the generally cheerful mind of Jack Ryan."
"大家也许记得，他们在亚罗井偶遇时，杰克·瑞安曾邀请哈里参加一星期后在欧文举办的庆典。哈里接受了邀请并明确许诺他会到场。杰克·瑞安知道他的朋友是个信守承诺的人，很多事情已证明了这一点。对他来说，许诺过的事情就一定要做到。现在，在欧文的庆典上样样不缺，既不缺歌曲，也不缺舞蹈，更不缺各类乐事——独独少了哈里·福特。","It may be remembered that, in their encounter in the Yarrow shaft, Jack Ryan had invited Harry to come a week afterwards to the festivities at Irvine.Harry had accepted and promised expressly to be there.Jack Ryan knew, having had it proved by many circumstances, that his friend was a man of his word.With him, a thing promised was a thing done.Now, at the Irvine merry-making, nothing was wanting; neither song, nor dance, nor fun of any sort—nothing but Harry Ford."
"瑞安还没看到报纸上刊登的关于詹姆斯·斯塔尔的启事。因而，这个诚实的小伙子只是在担心哈里的缺席，他告诉自己可能是发生了什么严重的事情，使哈里没能履行诺言。所以，欧文庆典过后的第二天，杰克·瑞安打算从格拉斯哥乘火车前往多查特矿井。要不是被一个几乎要了他性命的事故耽搁了，他应该已经到矿井了。在十二月十二号晚上发生了一件事，这件事证实了那些信奉超自然学说的人的观点。在梅尔罗斯农场，有很多人信奉超自然学说。","The notice relative to James Starr, published in the papers, had not yet been seen by Ryan.The honest fellow was therefore only worried by Harry’s absence, telling himself that something serious could alone have prevented him from keeping his promise.So, the day after the Irvine games, Jack Ryan intended to take the railway from Glasgow and go to the Dochart pit; and this he would have done had he not been detained by an accident which nearly cost him his life.Something which occurred on the night of the 12th of December was of a nature to support the opinions of all partisans of the supernatural, and there were many at Melrose Farm."
"欧文是伦弗鲁郡的一个小海港，居住着将近七千人，它位于苏格兰海岸的一个急弯上，靠近克莱德湾的入口处。在这一片海岸上，最古老最有名的废墟当属罗伯特·斯图尔特城堡的废墟，这个城堡被叫做邓唐纳德城堡。","Irvine, a little seaport of Renfrew, containing nearly seven thousand inhabitants, lies in a sharp bend made by the Scottish coast, near the mouth of the Firth of Clyde.The most ancient and the most famed ruins on this part of the coast were those of this castle of Robert Stuart, which bore the name of Dundonald Castle."
"邓唐纳德城堡是所有游荡小鬼的庇护所，现在这里已完全空寂无人。它坐落在一块高耸的岩石上面，离城镇两英里远，鲜少有人来参观。有时，一些外地人心血来潮，想去探索这些古老的历史遗迹，但他们总是独自前往。无论如何，欧文的居民都不会带他们去那儿。的确，一些传说是以出没在古堡里的某些“火焰少女”为原型的。","At this period Dundonald Castle, a refuge for all the stray goblins of the country, was completely deserted.It stood on the top of a high rock, two miles from the town, and was seldom visited.Sometimes a few strangers took it into their heads to explore these old historical remains, but then they always went alone.The inhabitants of Irvine would not have taken them there at any price.Indeed, several legends were based on the story of certain “fire-maidens,” who haunted the old castle."
"那些极度迷信的人声称，他们曾亲眼见过这些怪诞的生灵。杰克·瑞安自然是他们中的一员。事实上真有一些长长的火焰会时不时地出现，时而出现在一截破损的墙壁上，时而出现在邓唐纳德城堡最高处的塔顶上。","The most superstitious declared they had seen these fantastic creatures with their own eyes.Jack Ryan was naturally one of them.It was a fact that from time to time long flames appeared, sometimes on a broken piece of wall, sometimes on the summit of the tower which was the highest point of Dundonald Castle."
"这些火焰真的会像人们所断言的那样呈现出人形吗？它们配得上岸边的人们给它们起的名字“火焰少女”吗？这很显然只是一个视觉上的错觉，人们的轻信又加深了这一错觉。科学可以轻易地解释这种现象。","Did these flames really assume a human shape, as was asserted?Did they merit the name of fire-maidens, given them by the people of the coast?It was evidently just an optical delusion, aided by a good deal of credulity, and science could easily have explained the phenomenon."
"无论怎样，据说这些火焰少女经常出没在这座古堡的废墟里，并在那儿狂跳斯特拉斯贝舞，他们尤其喜欢在深夜出没。尽管杰克·瑞安是个胆大的人，却从不敢用他的风笛为那些舞蹈伴奏。","However that might be, these fire-maidens had the reputation of frequenting the ruins of the old castle and there performing wild strathspeys, especially on dark nights.Jack Ryan, bold fellow though he was, would never have dared to accompany those dances with the music of his bagpipes."
"“老尼克足以应付他们了！”他说道，“他不需要我加入他那糟糕的乐队。”","“Old Nick is enough for them!” said he.“He doesn’t need me to complete his infernal orchestra.”"
"我们可以很肯定的是，人们常常在晚间谈论这些奇怪的幽灵。杰克·瑞安正要以其中一个鬼怪故事来结束今夜的故事。他的听众们被他带入了鬼怪世界，他们逐渐进入了一种对任何事情都深信不疑的状态之中。","We may well believe that these strange apparitions frequently furnished a text for the evening stories.Jack Ryan was ending the evening with one of these.His auditors, transported into the phantom world, were worked up into a state of mind which would believe anything."
"突然，从外面传来了叫喊声。杰克·瑞安立刻停下了讲了一半的故事，所有人都冲出了谷仓。夜晚一片漆黑。狂风暴雨席卷着海滩。两三个渔民用他们最大的声音叫喊着。他们背抵着一块岩石，以便更好地抵挡狂风。","All at once shouts were heard outside.Jack Ryan stopped short in the middle of his story, and all rushed out of the barn.The night was pitchy dark.Squalls of wind and rain swept along the beach.Two or three fishermen, their backs against a rock, the better to resist the wind, were shouting at the top of their voices."
"杰克·瑞安和他的同伴们朝他们跑去。然而，这叫喊声并不是朝农场居民喊的，而是在警告那群没有意识到正在走向毁灭的人。一个黑暗的、模糊的物体出现在不远处的海面上。这是一艘轮船，它的前桅上挂着一盏白灯，右舷边挂着一盏绿灯，外侧还挂着一盏红灯，人们通过这些灯便可以判断出它的位置。它显然是径直朝岩石驶去。","Jack Ryan and his companions ran up to them.The shouts were, however, not for the inhabitants of the farm, but to warn men who, without being aware of it, were going to destruction.A dark, confused mass appeared some way out at sea.It was a vessel whose position could be seen by her lights, for she carried a white one on her foremast, a green on the starboard side, and a red on the outside.She was evidently running straight on the rocks."
"“一艘遇险的船？”瑞安说。","“A ship in distress?” said Ryan."
"“唉，”一个渔民回答道，“现在他们想抢风而上，却太迟了！”","“Ay,” answered one of the fishermen, “and now they want to tack, but it’s too late!”"
"“他们想驶到岸边来吗？”另一个渔民说道。","“Do they want to run ashore?” said another."
"“似乎是这样，”一个渔民回答道，“除非他被什么给误导了——”","“It seems so,” responded one of the fishermen, “unless he has been misled by some—”"
"杰克大喊一声，打断了这人的话。船员们能听到这一声叫喊吗？不管怎样，让他们避开那排在黑暗中闪着白光的浪花已经太迟了。","The man was interrupted by a yell from Jack.Could the crew have heard it?At any rate, it was too late for them to beat back from the line of breakers which gleamed white in the darkness."
"但是，瑞安的这最后一次努力并不是像人们本以为的那样，并不是为了警告那只在劫难逃的轮船的。此时他背对着大海。他的同伴们也转过身，盯着位于内陆半英里左右的一处地方。那是邓唐纳德城堡。在那座古老塔楼的塔顶上，一道长长的火焰在狂风中旋转扭动。","But it was not, as might be supposed, a last effort of Ryan’s to warn the doomed ship.He now had his back to the sea.His companions turned also, and gazed at a spot situated about half a mile inland.It was Dundonald Castle.A long flame twisted and bent under the gale, on the summit of the old tower."
"“火焰少女！”那些迷信的人惊恐地叫道。","“The Fire-Maiden!” cried the superstitious men in terror."
"很显然，要想从那道火焰里找出某种人形需要极好的想象力。它在风中飘荡着，像是一面发光的旗子，它有时似乎绕塔而飞，就像快要熄灭了一样，但瞬间过后它又在它蓝色的光点上舞动。","Clearly, it needed a good strong imagination to find any human likeness in that flame.Waving in the wind like a luminous flag, it seemed sometimes to fly round the tower, as if it was just going out, and a moment after it was seen again dancing on its blue point."
"“火焰少女！火焰少女！”惊恐的渔民和农民们叫喊道。","“The Fire-Maiden! The Fire-Maiden!” cried the terrified fishermen and peasants."
"这时真相大白了。这艘船在迷雾中迷失了方向，把邓唐纳德城堡顶端的火焰当成了欧文的灯光。当它正驶向不能为它提供任何庇护的海滨时，它认为自己处在北边十英里外的海湾入口。","All was then explained.The ship, having lost her reckoning in the fog, had taken this flame on the top of Dundonald Castle for the Irvine light.She thought herself at the entrance of the Firth, ten miles to the north, when she was really running on a shore which offered no refuge."
"如果还有时间，怎样做才能救下这艘船呢？太迟了。一阵可怕的撞击声传来，盖过了狂风肆虐的声音。撞船了。那排白色的激浪顷刻间化为乌有，轮船向一边倾斜着，倒在岩石之中。","What could be done to save her, if there was still time?It was too late.A frightful crash was heard above the tumult of the elements.The vessel had struck.The white line of surf was broken for an instant; she heeled over on her side and lay among the rocks."
"与此同时，出于一种奇怪的巧合，那道长长的火焰消失了，就像被一阵狂风席卷而去。大地、大海和天空陷入了一片漆黑之中。","At the same time, by a strange coincidence, the long flame disappeared, as if it had been swept away by a violent gust.Earth, sea, and sky were plunged in complete darkness."
"“火焰少女！”当这个在瑞安和他的同伴们眼中具有超自然力的幽灵消失时，瑞安最后一次大叫道。这些迷信的苏格兰人先前没有勇气去面对凭空想象出来的危险，但这时，面对现实中的危险，他们已经鼓足勇气准备去营救他们的同胞。暴风雨没有使他们退却。就像之前他们极度轻信一般，现在他们极度英勇地将绳子紧紧地系在腰间，冲进海浪中去营救那些失事轮船中的人们。","“The Fire-Maiden!” shouted Ryan, for the last time, as the apparition, which he and his companions believed supernatural, disappeared.But then the courage of these superstitious Scotchmen, which had failed before a fancied danger, returned in face of a real one, which they were ready to brave in order to save their fellow-creatures.The tempest did not deter them.As heroic as they had before been credulous, fastening ropes round their waists, they rushed into the waves to the aid of those on the wreck."
"幸好，他们的努力成功了，尽管他们中有些人被岩石撞成了重伤——胆大的杰克·瑞安便是其中之一。而那条船上的全体船员包括船长和八名水手被安然无恙地带到了海滩上。","Happily, they succeeded in their endeavors, although some—and bold Jack Ryan was among the number—were severely wounded on the rocks.But the captain of the vessel and the eight sailors who composed his crew were hauled up, safe and sound, on the beach."
"这是一艘挪威的“穆塔拉”号双桅船，装载着木材前往格拉斯哥。除了几根被海浪卷起冲上海滩岩石的圆材外，这艘“穆塔拉”双桅船什么也没剩下。","The ship was the Norwegian brig Motala, laden with timber, and bound for Glasgow.Of the Motala herself nothing remained but a few spars, washed up by the waves, and dashed among the rocks on the beach."
"杰克·瑞安和三个同他一样受了伤的同伴被送到了梅尔罗斯农场里的一间屋子，他们在那儿受到了悉心的照顾。瑞安伤得最重，当他腰间系着绳索冲进大海时，海浪几乎立刻就将他冲了回来并撞上了岩石。的确，他被带到海滩上时几乎都快没命了。","Jack Ryan and three of his companions, wounded like himself, were carried into a room of Melrose Farm, where every care was lavished on them.Ryan was the most hurt, for when with the rope round his waist he had rushed into the sea, the waves had almost immediately dashed him back against the rocks.He was brought, indeed, very nearly lifeless on to the beach."
"因而，这位勇敢的小伙子卧病在床了好些天，这还真令他兴味索然。然而，一旦他被获准能随心所欲地唱歌，他就能耐心地忍受这些痛苦了。农场里整天都回荡着他欢快的歌声。但这次冒险之后，他对那些以折磨人类来取乐的棕仙和其他鬼怪们产生了一种更强烈的恐惧感，他认为它们是这次“穆塔拉”号遇难的罪魁祸首。他无论如何都不相信火焰少女并不存在，也不相信那道火焰突然出现在废墟中仅仅只是一种自然现象。任何解释都无法使他信服。他的同伴们可能比他更执拗于他们的迷信。据他们看来，是火焰少女中的某一个不怀好意地将“穆塔拉”号引向了海岸。人们既希望惩治这个火焰少女，也试图要将这场风暴的罪魁祸首绳之于法！法官们大可下令进行逮捕，但火焰不可能被监禁起来，人们也没法给触摸不到的东西拷上手铐。必须承认，这些最终的调查结果至少在表面上给这种迷信的解释提供了依据。","The brave fellow was therefore confined to bed for several days, to his great disgust.However, as soon as he was given permission to sing as much as he liked, he bore his trouble patiently, and the farm echoed all day with his jovial voice.But from this adventure he imbibed a more lively sentiment of fear with regard to brownies and other goblins who amuse themselves by plaguing mankind, and he made them responsible for the catastrophe of the Motala.It would have been vain to try and convince him that the Fire-Maidens did not exist, and that the flame, so suddenly appearing among the ruins, was but a natural phenomenon.No reasoning could make him believe it.His companions were, if possible, more obstinate than he in their credulity.According to them, one of the Fire-Maidens had maliciously attracted the Motala to the coast.As to wishing to punish her, as well try to bring the tempest to justice!The magistrates might order what arrests they pleased, but a flame cannot be imprisoned, an impalpable being can't be handcuffed.It must be acknowledged that the researches which were ultimately made gave ground, at least in appearance, to this superstitious way of explaining the facts."
"调查进行得非常仔细。政府官员们来到邓唐纳德城堡，接着非常积极地展开了调查。法官们首先想要查明的是地面上是否留有一些足迹，这些足迹是否不是鬼怪的足迹。但是根本就找不到什么足迹，无论是旧的还是新的。此外，地面自前一天下雨之后就一直很潮湿，上面根本就留不下任何痕迹。","The inquiry was made with great care.Officials came to Dundonald Castle, and they proceeded to conduct a most vigorous search.The magistrate wished first to ascertain if the ground bore any footprints, which could be attributed to other than goblins’ feet.It was impossible to find the least trace, whether old or new.Moreover, the earth, still damp from the rain of the day before, would have preserved the least vestige."
"所有这些调查得出的结果是，法官们在原来的困扰之上只是得到了一个新的传说，这个传说可以加入到原先就有的那些传说之中——这个传说会随着“穆塔拉”号的灾难记忆而永恒流传，并为火焰少女的存在增添了不容置疑的证据。","The result of all this was, that the magistrates only got for their trouble a new legend added to so many others—a legend which would be perpetuated by the remembrance of the catastrophe of the Motala, and indisputably confirm the truth of the apparition of the Fire-Maidens."
"像杰克·瑞安这样体格健壮、精力充沛的小伙子是不可能长时间卧病在床的。一些扭伤和擦伤还不足以让他多躺些日子。他没有时间养病。","A hearty fellow like Jack Ryan, with so strong a constitution, could not be long confined to his bed.A few sprains and bruises were not quite enough to keep him on his back longer than he liked.He had not time to be ill."
"因此，杰克很快康复了。自从能够重新走路起，他就想在重回农场工作之前去看看他的朋友哈里，弄清他为什么没有去参加欧文的庆典。他无法理解哈里的缺席，因为哈里不是个轻易许诺而不去履行承诺的人。而且，要说老工头的儿子也不可能没有听说“穆塔拉”号失事的事情，因为所有的报纸都刊登了这次事故。哈里一定知道杰克参与了这次事故，还出事了，他不大可能不赶到农场来看看他的老朋友怎么样了。","Jack, therefore, soon got well.As soon as he was on his legs again, before resuming his work on the farm, he wished to go and visit his friend Harry, and learn why he had not come to the Irvine merry-making.He could not understand his absence, for Harry was not a man who would willingly promise and not perform.It was unlikely, too, that the son of the old overman had not heard of the wreck of the Motala, as it was in all the papers.He must know the part Jack had taken in it, and what had happened to him, and it was unlike Harry not to hasten to the farm and see how his old chum was going on."
"哈里之所以没来，一定是发生了什么事情使他未能成行。让杰克·瑞安相信哈里不关心他，就等于说是让他立刻否定火焰少女的存在。","As Harry had not come, there must have been something to prevent him.Jack Ryan would as soon deny the existence of the Fire-Maidens as believe in Harry’s indifference."
"灾难发生两天后，杰克愉悦地离开了农场，他感觉自己的伤并无大碍。前往火车站时，他用情地唱着歌，海边的峭壁上也传来回声。途径格拉斯哥的火车会把他送往斯特林和卡伦德。","Two days after the catastrophe Jack left the farm merrily, feeling nothing of his wounds.Singing in the fullness of his heart, he awoke the echoes of the cliff, as he walked to the station of the railway, which VIA Glasgow would take him to Stirling and Callander."
"等车的时候，他的注意力被贴在墙上的一张海报吸引住了，海报上登着这样一则启事：","As he was waiting for his train, his attention was attracted by a bill posted up on the walls, containing the following notice:"
"“十二月四日，爱丁堡的工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔在格兰顿码头登上了“威尔士王子”号轮船。同天他在斯特林码头下了船。从那时起，他便再无音讯了。","“On the 4th of December, the engineer, James Starr, of Edinburgh, embarked from Granton Pier, on board the Prince of Wales.He disembarked the same day at Stirling.From that time nothing further has been heard of him."
"如果有任何关于他的消息，请送至爱丁堡皇家科学研究所主席处。”","“Any information concerning him is requested to be sent to the President of the Royal Institution, Edinburgh.”"
"杰克·瑞安站在这则启事前，极其惊讶地从头到尾看了两遍。","Jack Ryan, stopping before one of these advertisements, read it twice over, with extreme surprise."
"“斯塔尔先生！”他惊叫道，“怎么会呢，十二月四日，我还在多查特矿井的梯子上遇见过他和哈里呢！那是十天前！他就是从那时起失踪的！这也解释了为什么我的朋友没来欧文了。”","“Mr. Starr!” he exclaimed.“Why, on the 4th of December I met him with Harry on the ladder of the Dochart pit!That was ten days ago!And he has not been seen from that time!That explains why my chum didn't come to Irvine.”"
"杰克没花时间去写信给皇家科学研究所的主席，告诉他自己所知道的有关詹姆斯·斯塔尔的消息，他跳上了火车，决定首先前往亚罗井。如有必要，他会下到矿井深处去找哈里，工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔肯定和他在一起。","And without taking time to inform the President of the Royal Institution by letter, what he knew relative to James Starr, Jack jumped into the train, determining to go first of all to the Yarrow shaft.There he would descend to the depths of the pit, if necessary, to find Harry, and with him was sure to be the engineer James Starr."
"“他们再也没出现过，”他自言自语道，“为什么呢？有什么事情阻止了他们吗？是一些重要的事情将他们一直留在矿底吗？我必须弄清楚！”瑞安加快脚步，不到半小时便抵达了亚罗井。","“They haven’t turned up again,” said he to himself.“Why?Has anything prevented them?Could any work of importance keep them still at the bottom of the mine?I must find out!” and Ryan, hastening his steps, arrived in less than an hour at the Yarrow shaft."
"表面上，这里没有任何变化。周围一如既往地寂静。没有一个生灵在这片被遗弃的地方出没。杰克走进了遮盖着井口的破烂工棚。他向下盯着黑暗的深井——什么也没有看见。他留神听着——什么也没听见。","Externally nothing was changed.The same silence around.Not a living creature was moving in that desert region.Jack entered the ruined shed which covered the opening of the shaft.He gazed down into the dark abyss—nothing was to be seen.He listened—nothing was to be heard."
"“我的灯！”他大叫道，“它怎么不见了！”瑞安以前来矿井时用的那盏灯通常都放在一个角落里，靠近矿井最上面那把梯子的楼梯平台处。它不在了。","“And my lamp!” he exclaimed; “suppose it isn't in its place!”The lamp which Ryan used when he visited the pit was usually deposited in a corner, near the landing of the topmost ladder.It had disappeared."
"“这真讨厌！”杰克说道，开始感到非常不安。杰克虽然很迷信，但他仍毫不犹豫地说：“我要去，尽管这下面会和地狱的最底层一样黑暗！”","“Here is a nuisance!” said Jack, beginning to feel rather uneasy.Then, without hesitating, superstitious though he was, “I will go,” said he, “though it’s as dark down there as in the lowest depths of the infernal regions!”"
"他开始顺着长长的梯子往下爬，梯子通往幽暗的井下。杰克·瑞安没有忘记他采矿的旧习惯，他相当熟悉多查特矿井，不然他压根不敢来冒这种险。不管怎样，他非常小心地爬着。由于梯子的某些地方被虫蛀了，他每下一步都用脚去试探。若踩空一步跌落下去，跌入这个1500英尺深的地方，那就会要了他的命。他数着每一个经过的楼梯平台，他清楚自己只有下了第三十个平台才会到达井底。他认为，一旦到了井底，在主通道的尽头找到我们曾说过的那些村舍和建筑物是不怎么困难的。","And he began to descend the long flight of ladders, which led down the gloomy shaft.Jack Ryan had not forgotten his old mining habits, and he was well acquainted with the Dochart pit, or he would scarcely have dared to venture thus.He went very carefully, however.His foot tried each round, as some of them were worm-eaten.A false step would entail a deadly fall, through this space of fifteen hundred feet.He counted each landing as he passed it, knowing that he could not reach the bottom of the shaft until he had left the thirtieth.Once there, he would have no trouble, so he thought, in finding the cottage, built, as we have said, at the extremity of the principal passage."
"杰克·瑞安就这样走着，一直走到了第二十六个楼梯平台，这时他距井底只有两百英尺了。","Jack Ryan went on thus until he got to the twenty-sixth landing, and consequently had two hundred feet between him and the bottom."
"在这儿，他伸下腿去试了试第二十七架梯子的第一个横档。但是，任他的脚在空中晃来晃去，他却没找到任何可以支撑的地方。他跪下来，用手去摸梯子的顶部。什么都没有。","Here he put down his leg to feel for the first rung of the twenty-seventh ladder.But his foot swinging in space found nothing to rest on.He knelt down and felt about with his hand for the top of the ladder.It was in vain."
"“老尼克一定是来过了这里！”杰克说道，有了一丝恐惧。","“Old Nick himself must have been down this way!” said Jack, not without a slight feeling of terror."
"他抱着胳膊，站着考虑了一会儿，渴望能穿透这无边的黑暗。随后他想到，要是他下不去，那么呆在矿里的人也上不来了。现在矿井深处和井上没有任何通道。如果自他上次拜访村舍之后亚罗井的底层梯子就被移走了，那西蒙·福特、他的妻子、儿子以及工程师会怎么样呢？","He stood considering for some time, with folded arms, and longing to be able to pierce the impenetrable darkness.Then it occurred to him that if he could not get down, neither could the inhabitants of the mine get up.There was now no communication between the depths of the pit and the upper regions.If the removal of the lower ladders of the Yarrow shaft had been effected since his last visit to the cottage, what had become of Simon Ford, his wife, his son, and the engineer?"
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔长时间的失踪事件证明，自那天瑞安在井里见过他后，他就没有离开过矿井。自那以后，村舍都是由谁来供应食物呢？这些人不幸被困在地面1500英尺以下，他们这会儿肯定没有食物了。","The prolonged absence of James Starr proved that he had not left the pit since the day Ryan met with him in the shaft.How had the cottage been provisioned since then?The food of these unfortunate people, imprisoned fifteen hundred feet below the surface of the ground, must have been exhausted by this time."
"当杰克看到自己无法到达村舍时，所有这些念头从他的脑中闪过。他可以肯定这里的通道是被人恶意破坏了。无论如何，必须要通知当局，越快越好。","All this passed through Jack’s mind, as he saw that by himself he could do nothing to get to the cottage.He had no doubt but that communication had been interrupted with a malevolent intention.At any rate, the authorities must be informed, and that as soon as possible."
"杰克·瑞安从梯子平台上向前探身。","Jack Ryan bent forward from the landing."
"“哈里！哈里！”他用他最大的声音叫喊着。","“Harry! Harry!” he shouted with his powerful voice."
"哈里的名字在岩石间反复回荡，最后消失在矿井深处。","Harry’s name echoed and re-echoed among the rocks, and finally died away in the depths of the shaft."
"瑞安快速地沿着梯子往上爬，回到了地面上，见到了日光。他一刻也没耽搁，赶到了卡伦德站，正好赶上去爱丁堡的特快列车，三点钟就到了市长阁下面前。","Ryan rapidly ascended the upper ladders and returned to the light of day.Without losing a moment he reached the Callander station, just caught the express to Edinburgh, and by three o'clock was before the Lord Provost."
"在那儿，他表明了自己的意见，人们也听取了他的意见。他解释得很清楚，人们没有任何疑问。皇家科学研究所的主席威廉·埃尔菲斯顿爵士不仅是斯塔尔的同事，也是他的私交。他也得到了通知，并得令马上指挥即将展开的煤矿搜救活动。他安排了几个人一起前去，他们带上了灯、镐及长绳梯，也没忘记带上食物和饮料。随后在杰克·瑞安的指引下，队伍朝阿伯福伊尔煤矿出发了。","There his declaration was received.His account was given so clearly that it could not be doubted.Sir William Elphiston, President of the Royal Institution, and not only colleague, but a personal friend of Starr’s, was also informed, and asked to direct the search which was to be made without delay in the mine.Several men were placed at his disposal, supplied with lamps, picks, long rope ladders, not forgetting provisions and cordials.Then guided by Jack Ryan, the party set out for the Aberfoyle mines."
"就在同一天晚上，考察队到达了亚罗井的入口处，并且下到了第二十七个楼梯平台上。杰克·瑞安已在这儿停留了几个小时了。人们把灯系在长长的绳索上，又把灯伸向井底，大家看到最后四截梯子都已不在了。","The same evening the expedition arrived at the opening of the Yarrow shaft, and descended to the twenty-seventh landing, at which Jack Ryan had been stopped a few hours previously.The lamps, fastened to long ropes, were lowered down the shaft, and it was thus ascertained that the four last ladders were wanting."
"灯一被拉上来，他们便在楼梯平台上系好一架绳梯，绳梯展开通向井底，所有的人一个接一个地向下爬。杰克·瑞安向下爬得最费劲，因为他第一个顺着晃动的绳梯往下爬，并得为其他人固定梯子。","As soon as the lamps had been brought up, the men fixed to the landing a rope ladder, which unrolled itself down the shaft, and all descended one after the other.Jack Ryan’s descent was the most difficult, for he went first down the swinging ladders, and fastened them for the others."
"井底完完全全是一片废墟。杰克·瑞安惊叫道:“这里有几截梯子，有些被烧掉了一半！”听到这些，威廉爵士非常惊讶。","The space at the bottom of the shaft was completely deserted; but Sir William was much surprised at hearing Jack Ryan exclaim, “Here are bits of the ladders, and some of them half burnt!”"
"“烧掉了？”威廉爵士重复道，“的确，这儿确实有相当多灰烬，显然已经冷却了很长时间！”","“Burnt?” repeated Sir William.“Indeed, here sure enough are cinders which have evidently been cold a long time!”"
"“爵士，在您看来，”瑞安问道，“斯塔尔先生可能会有什么理由烧毁这些梯子，毁掉通向外面的通道吗？”","“Do you think, sir,” asked Ryan, “that Mr. Starr could have had any reason for burning the ladders, and thus breaking of communication with the world?”"
"“肯定没有，”威廉·埃尔菲斯顿爵士回答道，他沉思起来，“走吧，小伙子，带我们去村舍吧。在那里我们会查明真相的。”","“Certainly not,” answered Sir William Elphiston, who had become very thoughtful.“Come, my lad, lead us to the cottage.There we shall ascertain the truth.”"
"杰克·瑞安摇了摇头，好像一点儿也不相信。随后，他从一个考察队员手中拿过灯，沿着多查特矿井的主通道继续快步前行。其他人都跟着他。","Jack Ryan shook his head, as if not at all convinced.Then, taking a lamp from the hands of one of the men, he proceeded with a rapid step along the principal passage of the Dochart pit.The others all followed him."
"一刻钟后，队伍到达了西蒙·福特的村舍所在的洞穴。窗户里没有光。瑞安猛冲到门口，推开门。房子里空空的。","In a quarter of an hour the party arrived at the excavation in which stood Simon Ford’s cottage.There was no light in the window.Ryan darted to the door, and threw it open.The house was empty."
"他们检查了这个昏暗居所里的所有房间。没有发现任何打斗的痕迹。所有东西井然有序，就像老马奇仍在那儿一样。那里甚至还有足量的食物，足够福特一家吃上好几天。","They examined all the rooms in the somber habitation.No trace of violence was to be found.All was in order, as if old Madge had been still there.There was even an ample supply of provisions, enough to last the Ford family for several days."
"村舍房客的失踪相当离奇。但是，有没有可能弄清他们离开这儿的确切时间呢？有可能，因为在这个地方白天和夜晚没有分别，马奇便习惯每天在她的年历上画上个十字标记。","The absence of the tenants of the cottage was quite unaccountable.But was it not possible to find out the exact time they had quitted it?Yes, for in this region, where there was no difference of day or night, Madge was accustomed to mark with a cross each day in her almanac."
"这本年历钉在墙上，最后一个十字标记是在十二月六日画上的，也就是在詹姆斯·斯塔尔到达的第二天，瑞安可以肯定这一点。显然是在十二月六日，也就是十天前，西蒙·福特、他的妻子、儿子以及客人离开了村舍。有可能是因为工程师在煤矿里展开了一次新的勘探，所以才失踪了这么长时间吗？肯定不是。","The almanac was pinned up on the wall, and there the last cross had been made at the 6th of December; that is to say, a day after the arrival of James Starr, to which Ryan could positively swear.It was clear that on the 6th of December, ten days ago, Simon Ford, his wife, son, and guest, had quitted the cottage.Could a fresh exploration of the mine, undertaken by the engineer, account for such a long absence?Certainly not."
"四周都是一片漆黑。人们手中的灯仅仅只能够照亮他们所站的地方。突然，杰克·瑞安发出了一声叫喊，“看那边，那边！”","It was intensely dark all round.The lamps held by the men gave light only just where they were standing.Suddenly Jack Ryan uttered a cry.“Look there, there!”"
"他的手指指向一道较亮的灯光，这道亮光正在远处移动着。“跟着那道光，伙计们！”威廉爵士叫道。","His finger was pointing to a tolerably bright light, which was moving about in the distance.“After that light, my men!” exclaimed Sir William."
"“那是一道鬼火！”瑞安说道，“跟着它有什么用呢？我们根本抓不住它。”","“It’s a goblin light!” said Ryan.“So what’s the use?We shall never catch it.”"
"主席和他的伙计们一点儿也不迷信，朝着那道光移动的方向猛冲了过去。杰克·瑞安大胆地跟着他们，很快冲到了队伍的最前面。","The president and his men, little given to superstition, darted off in the direction of the moving light.Jack Ryan, bravely following their example, quickly overtook the head-most of the party."
"这是一场令人疲倦的长距离追逐。那盏提灯似乎被一个体型小但异常敏捷的生灵拎着。","It was a long and fatiguing chase.The lantern seemed to be carried by a being of small size, but singular agility."
"它有时消失在某根柱子后面，随后又出现在某个十字水平巷道的末端。一个急转弯会让它离开人们的视线，看起来像是完全消失了，但突然又会出现和之前一样明亮的灯光。然而，他们无法接近它。瑞安认为他们永远无法抓到它，这说法似乎并非毫无根据。","Every now and then it disappeared behind some pillar, then was seen again at the end of a cross gallery.A sharp turn would place it out of sight, and it seemed to have completely disappeared, when all at once there would be the light as bright as ever.However, they gained very little on it, and Ryan’s belief that they could never catch it seemed far from groundless."
"这样徒劳追逐了一小时之后，威廉·艾尔菲斯顿爵士和他的同伴们已经往矿井西南方向走了很长一段路，他们开始怀疑是否真的在和一个触摸不到的生灵打交道了。随后，这个鬼怪和追逐它的那些人之间的距离仿佛正在变短。是它累了，还是这个隐形的生灵想把威廉爵士和他的同伴们也引诱到村舍居民可能已被引诱到的地方去？这很难说。","After an hour of this vain pursuit Sir William Elphiston and his companions had gone a long way in the southwest direction of the pit, and began to think they really had to do with an impalpable being.Just then it seemed as if the distance between the goblin and those who were pursuing it was becoming less.Could it be fatigued, or did this invisible being wish to entice Sir William and his companions to the place where the inhabitants of the cottage had perhaps themselves been enticed.It was hard to say."
"人们看见距离缩短了，又加倍努力起来。那道光之前在离他们两百多英尺的地方燃烧，现在看上去在五十英尺之内了。距离在继续缩小。持灯者变得隐约可见。有时，当它扭过头时，能看出一张模糊的人脸轮廓。杰克·瑞安不得不承认这里没有超自然的生灵，除非妖精会显现出人形。随后，向前跑着——","The men, seeing that the distance lessened, redoubled their efforts.The light which had before burnt at a distance of more than two hundred feet before them was now seen at less than fifty.The space continued to diminish.The bearer of the lamp became partially visible.Sometimes, when it turned its head, the indistinct profile of a human face could be made out, and unless a sprite could assume bodily shape, Jack Ryan was obliged to confess that here was no supernatural being.Then, springing forward,—"
"“加油，伙伴们！”他大喊道，“它累了！我们马上就快抓住它了，如果它的说话能力也像跑步能力这样好的话，我们就有好故事听了。”","“Courage, comrades!” he exclaimed; “it is getting tired!We shall soon catch it up now, and if it can talk as well as it can run we shall hear a fine story.”"
"但追逐突然变得更困难了。他们身在煤矿里的未知地方，狭窄的通道相互交错，就像迷宫里曲曲折折的道路。持灯者只需熄灭灯光，躲进某个黑暗的庇护所，便可以轻易地逃脱追捕。","But the pursuit had suddenly become more difficult.They were in unknown regions of the mine; narrow passages crossed each other like the windings of a labyrinth.The bearer of the lamp might escape them as easily as possible, by just extinguishing the light and retreating into some dark refuge."
"“的确，”威廉爵士想道，“如果它想避开我们，为什么不这么做呢？”","“And indeed,” thought Sir William, “if it wishes to avoid us, why does it not do so?”"
"目前为止，它明显没有避开他们的意图，但正当这种想法从威廉爵士的脑海中一闪而过时，那道光突然消失了。队伍继续追逐着，他们来到了一个天然洞口前，这个洞口极其狭窄，位于片岩之间。","Hitherto there had evidently been no intention to avoid them, but just as the thought crossed Sir William’s mind the light suddenly disappeared, and the party, continuing the pursuit, found themselves before an extremely narrow natural opening in the schistous rocks."
"威廉爵士和他的队伍立马调整好灯，向前一跃，猛地钻进洞口。但在他们沿着这条比之前更宽更高的新水平巷道走了一百步后，他们立刻停了下来。靠近岩壁那儿躺着四个人，平躺在地上——可能是四具尸体！","To trim their lamps, spring forward, and dart through the opening, was for Sir William and his party but the work of an instant.But before they had gone a hundred paces along this new gallery, much wider and loftier than the former, they all stopped short.There, near the wall, lay four bodies, stretched on the ground—four corpses, perhaps!"
"“詹姆斯·斯塔尔！”威廉·埃尔菲斯顿爵士惊叫道。","“James Starr!” exclaimed Sir William Elphiston."
"“哈里！哈里！”瑞安蹲在他的朋友身边叫喊道。","“Harry! Harry!” cried Ryan, throwing himself down beside his friend."
"这的确是工程师、马奇、西蒙以及哈里·福特，他们一动不动地躺在那儿。其中一个人轻轻地动了动，接着人们就听见马奇微弱的低语声，“照顾其他人！先救他们！”","It was indeed the engineer, Madge, Simon, and Harry Ford who were lying there motionless.But one of the bodies moved slightly, and Madge’s voice was heard faintly murmuring, “See to the others!Help them first!”"
"威廉爵士、杰克以及他们的同伴们给工程师和他的朋友们吞下去几滴白兰地，竭力尝试救活他们。他们很快成功了。这些不幸的人们在这个黑暗的洞穴里被关了十天，就快饿死了。他们曾三次在身边找到一块面包和一壶水，如果不是这样，他们肯定早就丧生了。毫无疑问，这些救了他们性命的友善生灵已经为他们做得够多了。","Sir William, Jack, and their companions endeavored to reanimate the engineer and his friends by getting them to swallow a few drops of brandy.They very soon succeeded.The unfortunate people, shut up in that dark cavern for ten days, were dying of starvation.They must have perished had they not on three occasions found a loaf of bread and a jug of water set near them.No doubt the charitable being to whom they owed their lives was unable to do more for them."
"威廉爵士想知道，这件事会不会是那个引诱他们来到詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们所躺之处的奇异小妖精做的。","Sir William wondered whether this might not have been the work of the strange sprite who had allured them to the very spot where James Starr and his companions lay."
"不管怎么样，工程师、马奇、西蒙以及哈里·福特都得救了。穿过狭窄的洞口，他们被带回了村舍。很显然，这个洞口是那个提着怪灯的人故意想要指给威廉爵士看的。这是一个天然的洞口。詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的同伴们用炸药炸开的那条通道，已经被一块块堆积起来的石头堵死了。所以，在他们勘探那个巨大洞穴时，回程路已被一个充满敌意的人蓄意关上了。","However that might be, the engineer, Madge, Simon, and Harry Ford were saved.They were assisted to the cottage, passing through the narrow opening which the bearer of the strange light had apparently wished to point out to Sir William.This was a natural opening.The passage which James Starr and his companions had made for themselves with dynamite had been completely blocked up with rocks laid one upon another.So, then, whilst they had been exploring the vast cavern, the way back had been purposely closed against them by a hostile hand."
"第十章　煤城","CHAPTER X COAL TOWN"
"上述事件发生三年后，出现了一本被誉为是“了不起的景点”的旅行指南。它被推荐给了大量来斯特林郡旅游的人，游客在几小时内就能游历新阿伯福伊尔煤矿的风光。","Three years after the events which have just been related, the guide-books recommended as a “great attraction,” to the numerous tourists who roam over the county of Stirling, a visit of a few hours to the mines of New Aberfoyle."
"无论是在旧大陆还是新大陆，在任何国家都没有哪个煤矿能呈现出更奇特的样子。","No mine in any country, either in the Old or New World, could present a more curious aspect."
"起先，游客们被安全舒适地送到地表下1500英尺的作业层。距卡伦德西南方七英里处，打开了一条倾斜的隧道，隧道里装饰着一个城堡似的入口、炮塔以及城垛。这条高高的隧道微微倾斜，笔直通向那个极大的地下室。被挖空的地下室位于地下深处，构造奇特。","To begin with, the visitor was transported without danger or fatigue to a level with the workings, at fifteen hundred feet below the surface of the ground.Seven miles to the southwest of Callander opened a slanting tunnel, adorned with a castellated entrance, turrets and battlements.This lofty tunnel gently sloped straight to the stupendous crypt, hollowed out so strangely in the bowels of the earth."
"一条靠液压动力驱动的双轨铁路线，在这个郡的地下村庄定时往来。这个村子叫“煤城”，彰显了其雄心壮志。","A double line of railway, the wagons being moved by hydraulic power, plied from hour to hour to and from the village thus buried in the subsoil of the county, and which bore the rather ambitious title of Coal Town."
"到达煤城后，游客们会发现，这个地方光和热的原动力主要是电力。虽然有许多通风井，但它们还不足以让日光充分进入新阿伯福伊尔，但是这里已有了充足的光亮。这些光从大量的电盘中发出。有些电盘悬挂在拱顶上，其他电盘挂在天然生成的柱子上——所有的电盘，无论是太阳形状或是星星形状，都由电磁机器产生的持续电流供电。一旦到了休息的时间，人们通过断开电线便可轻易地在整个煤矿里人为造就夜晚时间。","Arrived in Coal Town, the visitor found himself in a place where electricity played a principal part as an agent of heat and light.Although the ventilation shafts were numerous, they were not sufficient to admit much daylight into New Aberfoyle, yet it had abundance of light.This was shed from numbers of electric discs; some suspended from the vaulted roofs, others hanging on the natural pillars—all, whether suns or stars in size, were fed by continuous currents produced from electro-magnetic machines.When the hour of rest arrived, an artificial night was easily produced all over the mine by disconnecting the wires."
"在穹顶下有一个湖，范围可与马默斯洞穴的死海相比——无眼鱼成群结队地穿梭在幽深而清澈的湖水中。工程师给这个湖取名为马尔科姆湖。","Below the dome lay a lake of an extent to be compared to the Dead Sea of the Mammoth caves—a deep lake whose transparent waters swarmed with eyeless fish, and to which the engineer gave the name of Loch Malcolm."
"在那儿，在那个巨大的天然洞穴里，西蒙·福特盖了他的新村舍，就是拿爱丁堡王子街最好的房子来跟他交换，他也不会答应。这个房子位于湖岸边上，它的五个窗户朝向外面漆黑的湖水，湖水一直延伸到眼睛看不见的更远处。两个月后，第二处居所就在西蒙·福特的村舍旁搭建起来：这是詹姆斯·斯塔尔的村舍。工程师已全身心地投入在新阿伯福伊尔上，除最紧急的事情之外，没有什么事情能使他离开矿井。从那之后，他生活在他的煤矿世界中。","There, in this immense natural excavation, Simon Ford built his new cottage, which he would not have exchanged for the finest house in Prince’s Street, Edinburgh.This dwelling was situated on the shores of the loch, and its five windows looked out on the dark waters, which extended further than the eye could see.Two months later a second habitation was erected in the neighborhood of Simon Ford’s cottage: this was for James Starr.The engineer had given himself body and soul to New Aberfoyle, and nothing but the most imperative necessity ever caused him to leave the pit.There, then, he lived in the midst of his mining world."
"新煤田一经发现，所有以前的矿工们急忙丢下他们的犁和耙，重新拾起镐和锄。他们受到这份“铁饭碗”工作的吸引，受到掌管兴旺矿业的公司提供给劳工的高额工钱的引诱，于是抛弃了露天生活，把他们的住所安在煤矿里。","On the discovery of the new field, all the old colliers had hastened to leave the plow and harrow, and résumé the pick and mattock.Attracted by the certainty that work would never fail, allured by the high wages which the prosperity of the mine enabled the company to offer for labor, they deserted the open air for an underground life, and took up their abode in the mines."
"矿工们用砖砌成的房子非常别致，房子很快便多了起来；一些盖在马尔科姆湖的湖岸边，其他一些盖在拱门下。拱门就像桥墩一样，似乎是用来抵抗压在房子上面的重量的。煤城就这样建成了，它位于卡特琳湖东端下方，毗邻斯特林郡北部。在马尔科姆湖湖岸边有了一个规则的定居点。从一块巨大岩石的顶端俯瞰，这里就是一个献给圣贾尔斯的教堂，教堂的底部浸泡在这片地下海的海水里。","The miners’ houses, built of brick, soon grew up in a picturesque fashion; some on the banks of Loch Malcolm, others under the arches which seemed made to resist the weight that pressed upon them, like the piers of a bridge.So was founded Coal Town, situated under the eastern point of Loch Katrine, to the north of the county of Stirling.It was a regular settlement on the banks of Loch Malcolm.A chapel, dedicated to St. Giles, overlooked it from the top of a huge rock, whose foot was laved by the waters of the subterranean sea."
"悬挂在柱子和拱顶上的电盘会发光将这个地下城照亮，每当这时，它的样子便非常奇特、非常迷人，这也证明了旅行指南中的称赞名副其实。游客们蜂拥而至。","When this underground town was lighted up by the bright rays thrown from the discs, hung from the pillars and arches, its aspect was so strange, so fantastic, that it justified the praise of the guide-books, and visitors flocked to see it."
"煤城居民对这个地方的自豪之情就不必说了。他们几乎不离开他们工作的村庄——这点和西蒙·福特相似，他从未想过会再次出去。一谈到联合王国的天气，老工头总会说“那上面”总是下雨。必须承认，他并未说错。新阿伯福伊尔的所有家庭都很兴旺，三年内他们都过得还不错，那是他们在地上从未期望过的生活。许多婴儿出生时工程已经恢复了，他们还从未呼吸过外面的空气。","It is needless to say that the inhabitants of Coal Town were proud of their place.They rarely left their laboring village—in that imitating Simon Ford, who never wished to go out again.The old overman maintained that it always rained “up there,” and, considering the climate of the United Kingdom, it must be acknowledged that he was not far wrong.All the families in New Aberfoyle prospered well, having in three years obtained a certain com-petency which they could never have hoped to attain on the surface of the county.Dozens of babies, who were born at the time when the works were resumed, had never yet breathed the outer air."
"杰克·瑞安对此评论道，“他们断奶都十八个月了，还未见过日光呢！”","This made Jack Ryan remark, “It’s eighteen months since they were weaned, and they have not yet seen daylight!”"
"这里也许要提一下，在工程师的号召下跑来的第一批人中就有杰克·瑞安。这个快乐的小伙子认为重操他的旧业是他的职责。虽然梅尔罗斯农场失去了一位歌手和风笛手，但不要认为瑞安不再唱歌了。相反，新阿伯福伊尔的响亮回声用其强大的肺在回应他。","It may be mentioned here, that one of the first to run at the engineer’s call was Jack Ryan.The merry fellow had thought it his duty to return to his old trade.But though Melrose farm had lost singer and piper it must not be thought that Jack Ryan sung no more.On the contrary, the sonorous echoes of New Aberfoyle exerted their strong lungs to answer him."
"杰克·瑞安把他的住所安在西蒙·福特的新村舍里。他们给他提供了一间房，他毫不客气地以他坦率而亲切的方式接受了。老马奇喜欢他，因为他性格温和而且脾气好。关于有神秘生灵游荡在煤矿里这个话题，她和杰克在某种程度上有着相同的看法。当他俩单独在一起时，彼此会讲一些让人不寒而栗的鬼故事——这些故事对丰富北方神话颇有价值。","Jack Ryan took up his abode in Simon Ford’s new cottage.They offered him a room, which he accepted without ceremony, in his frank and hearty way.Old Madge loved him for his fine character and good nature.She in some degree shared his ideas on the subject of the fantastic beings who were supposed to haunt the mine, and the two, when alone, told each other stories wild enough to make one shudder—stories well worthy of enriching the hyperborean mythology."
"杰克就这样成了村舍里的一份子。他除了是个快乐的同伴外，也是个好工人。工程开始六个月后，他被任命为一帮采煤工的头儿。","Jack thus became the life of the cottage.He was, besides being a jovial companion, a good workman.Six months after the works had begun, he was made head of a gang of hewers."
"“干得好，福特先生，”在他任职几天后，他说道，“您发现了一块新煤田，尽管为此险些丢了性命——还好，付出的代价还不是太大。”","“That was a good work done, Mr. Ford,” said he, a few days after his appointment.“You discovered a new field, and though you narrowly escaped paying for the discovery with your life—well, it was not too dearly bought.”"
"“不，杰克，这是我们那时做的一笔好买卖！”老工头回答道，“但无论是斯塔尔先生还是我都没忘记是你救了我们的性命。”","“No, Jack, it was a good bargain we made that time!” answered the old overman.“But neither Mr. Starr nor I have forgotten that to you we owe our lives.”"
"“那没什么。”杰克回答道，“你们要把这些归功于您的儿子哈里，他明智地接受了我要他去欧文的邀请。”","“Not at all,” returned Jack.“You owe them to your son Harry, when he had the good sense to accept my invitation to Irvine.”"
"“没去成，不是吗？”哈里抓住他朋友的手，插话道，“不，杰克，要归功于你，你的伤势几乎没痊愈——要归功于你，没有延误一天，不，没有延误一小时，让我们在煤矿里活着被找到了！”","“And not to go, isn’t that it?” interrupted Harry, grasping his comrade’s hand.“No, Jack, it is to you, scarcely healed of your wounds—to you, who did not delay a day, no, nor an hour, that we owe our being found still alive in the mine!”"
"“瞎说，不是！”这个执拗的小伙子打断了哈里的话，“我可不想那么说，没这种事。我赶去是为弄清你怎么样了，哈里，就是这样。但为了弄清楚该感激谁，我要补充的是，如果没有那个没法接近的小妖怪——”","“Rubbish, no!” broke in the obstinate fellow.“I won’t have that said, when it’s no such thing.I hurried to find out what had become of you, Harry, that’s all.But to give everyone his due, I will add that without that unapproachable goblin—” "
"“啊，我们想到一起去了！”福特叫喊道，“一个小妖怪！”","“Ah, there we are!” cried Ford.“A goblin!”"
"“一个小妖怪，一个棕仙，一个妖精的孩子，”瑞安重复道，“火焰少女的一个表姐妹，一个乌瑞斯克，随便你怎样称呼！可以十分肯定的是，没有它，我们绝对不会在水平巷道里找到我们的路，你们也不可能出来。”","“A goblin, a brownie, a fairy’s child,” repeated Jack Ryan, “a cousin of the Fire-Maidens, an Urisk, whatever you like!It’s not the less certain that without it we should never have found our way into the gallery, from which you could not get out.”"
"“毋庸置疑，杰克，”哈里答道，“这个生灵是不是像你宁愿相信的那样是超自然的，还未见得。”","“No doubt, Jack,” answered Harry.“It remains to be seen whether this being was as supernatural as you choose to believe.”"
"“是超自然的！”瑞安喊道，“它就像鬼火一样是超自然的，你可以看见它随着手里的提灯蹦跳着；你可以试图去抓它，但它会像妖精一样逃走，就像影子一样消失！别感到不安了，哈里，我们迟早会再见到它！”","“Supernatural!” exclaimed Ryan.“But it was as supernatural as a Will-o’-the-Wisp, who may be seen skipping along with his lantern in his hand; you may try to catch him, but he escapes like a fairy, and vanishes like a shadow!Don't be uneasy, Harry, we shall see it again some day or other!”"
"“好了，杰克，”西蒙·福特说道，“究竟是不是鬼火，我们会努力找到它的，你必须帮助我们。”","“Well, Jack,” said Simon Ford, “Will-o’-the-Wisp or not, we shall try to find it, and you must help us.”"
"“如果您不小心的话，您会陷入困境的，福特先生！”杰克·瑞安回答道。","“You’ll get into a scrap if you don’t take care, Mr. Ford!” responded Jack Ryan."
"“我们会处理好的，杰克！”","“We’ll see about that, Jack!”"
"我们可以很容易想象到新阿伯福伊尔这片领地是如何很快地被福特一家熟悉，特别是被哈里所熟悉的。他知晓这里所有最为隐秘的复杂细节。他甚至能说出煤矿的哪一处对应着地上的哪一处。他知道在这个煤层上是克莱德湾，它延伸到洛蒙德湖和卡特琳湖。那些柱子支撑着格兰扁山脉的一个支脉。这个洞穴在邓巴顿被用作地下室。巴勒赫铁路从这片大水塘上方经过。这里是苏格兰海岸的终点。那是大海的起点，在春分和秋分的大风时节能清晰地听见海水的翻腾声。哈里在这些天然地下墓穴里是一名一流的向导，那些阿尔卑斯山的向导白天在雪山上所做的一切，他凭借惊人的直觉在这黑暗的煤矿里也能做到。","We may easily imagine how soon this domain of New Aberfoyle became familiar to all the members of the Ford family, but more particularly to Harry.He learnt to know all its most secret ins and outs.He could even say what point of the surface corresponded with what point of the mine.He knew that above this seam lay the Firth of Clyde, that there extended Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine.Those columns supported a spur of the Grampian mountains.This vault served as a basement to Dumbarton.Above this large pond passed the Balloch railway.Here ended the Scottish coast.There began the sea, the tumult of which could be distinctly heard during the equinoctial gales.Harry would have been a first-rate guide to these natural catacombs, and all that Alpine guides do on their snowy peaks in daylight he could have done in the dark mine by the wonderful power of instinct."
"他喜欢新阿伯福伊尔。许多次，他把灯卡在他的帽子上，深入到煤矿的最深处。他熟练操纵着独木舟去勘探矿里的水塘。他甚至去打猎，因为许多飞鸟被引到了地下——针尾鸭、沙锥鸟、鸭子，它们以在深水里成群游荡的鱼为生。哈里的眼睛似乎是为黑暗而生，就像水手的眼睛是为距离而生一样。然而，哈里所做的这一切都是被一种强大的动力所驱使着，即找到那个神秘的生灵。严格说来，它的介入救了他和他朋友们的性命。他会成功吗？如果预感可信的话，他肯定会成功；如果从他仍收效甚微的调查结果来判断，则肯定不会成功。","He loved New Aberfoyle.Many times, with his lamp stuck in his hat, did he penetrate its furthest depths.He explored its ponds in a skillfully-managed canoe.He even went shooting, for numerous birds had been introduced into the crypt—pintails, snipes, ducks, who fed on the fish which swarmed in the deep waters.Harry’s eyes seemed made for the dark, just as a sailor’s are made for distances.But all this while Harry felt irresistibly animated by the hope of finding the mysterious being whose intervention, Strictly speaking, had saved himself and his friends.Would he succeed?He certainly would, if presentiments were to be trusted; but certainly not, if he judged by the success which had as yet attended his researches."
"那些在发现新阿伯福伊尔之前针对老工头一家发动的袭击，再没发生过。","The attacks directed against the family of the old overman, before the discovery of New Aberfoyle, had not been renewed."
"第十一章　命悬一线","CHAPTER XI HANGING BY A THREAD"
"尽管福特一家这样过着幸福美满的生活，但不难看出，生性严肃的哈里变得越来越沉默寡言了。即使杰克·瑞安动用他所有的风趣幽默以及极富感染力的嬉戏方式，哈里也未能高兴起来。","Although in this way the Ford family led a happy and contented life, yet it was easy to see that Harry, naturally of a grave disposition, Became more and more quiet and reserved.Even Jack Ryan, with all his good humor and usually infectious merriment, failed to rouse him to gayety of manner."
"一个星期天——那是在六月——两个朋友一起在马尔科姆湖湖边散步。煤城歇工了。上面的世界正是暴风雨天气。滂沱的雨水倾泻而下，沉闷的蒸汽笼罩着大地，空气几乎令人窒息。","One Sunday—it was in the month of June—the two friends were walking together on the shores of Loch Malcolm.Coal Town rested from labor.In the world above, stormy weather prevailed.Violent rains fell, and dull sultry vapors brooded over the earth; the atmosphere was most oppressive."
"地下的煤城极其平静，无风无雨。气温温和宜人，没有狂风暴雨的迹象。从斯特林前来的旅行者络绎不绝，他们想来享受煤矿幽深处平静而新鲜的空气，这有什么奇怪的呢？","Down in Coal Town there was perfect calm; no wind, no rain.A soft and pleasant temperature existed instead of the strife of the elements which raged without.What wonder then, that excursionists from Stirling came in considerable numbers to enjoy the calm fresh air in the recesses of the mine?"
"电盘发出的明亮光线可能会令大不列颠的太阳嫉妒。太阳本该光芒四射，然而却常被雾遮盖着。杰克·瑞安一直谈论着从他们身边经过的嘈杂拥挤的游客，但是哈里根本没有注意他在说些什么。","The electric discs shed a brilliancy of light which the British sun, oftener obscured by fogs than it ought to be, might well envy.Jack Ryan kept talking of these visitors, who passed them in noisy crowds, but Harry paid very little attention to what he said."
"“我说，瞧瞧，哈里！”杰克叫喊道，“瞧，有这么多人来参观我们这里！高兴点，老朋友！为这个好地方更自豪些吧。如果你看起来这么闷闷不乐，你会令这些外面来的人们以为你嫉妒他们在地上的生活。”","“I say, do look, Harry!” cried Jack.“See what numbers of people come to visit us!Cheer up, old fellow!Do the honors of the place a little better.If you look so glum, you’ll make all these outside folks think you envy their life above-ground.”"
"“别管我，杰克，”哈里回答道，“你的欢乐足以代表我们俩的欢乐，我确信，那足够了。”","“Never mind me, Jack,” answered Harry.“You are jolly enough for two, I’m sure; that’s enough.”"
"“如果说我没有感觉到你的忧郁正蔓延到我全身，那我就被绞死好了！”杰克嚷道，“告诉你，我的眼睛正变得黯淡无光，嘴唇紧绷在一起，笑声卡在喉咙里，我忘记了我所有的歌。说吧，伙计，你怎么了？”","“I’ll be hanged if I don't feel your melancholy creeping over me though!” exclaimed Jack.“I declare my eyes are getting quite dull, my lips are drawn together, my laugh sticks in my throat; I’m forgetting all my songs.Come, man, what’s the matter with you?”"
"“你很清楚的，杰克。”","“You know well enough, Jack.”"
"“什么？那件旧事？”","“What? the old story?”"
"“是的，还是那些念头总缠扰着我。”","“Yes, the same thoughts haunt me.”"
"“啊，可怜的朋友！”杰克耸耸肩说道，“要是你像我一样，将所有的怪事算到煤矿里的那些小妖怪头上，你心里会更轻松些的。”","“Ah, poor fellow!” said Jack, shrugging his shoulders.“If you would only do like me, and set all the queer things down to the account of the goblins of the mine, you would be easier in your mind.”"
"“但是，杰克，你很清楚这些小妖怪仅仅存在于你的想象中。自从工程恢复后，一个小妖怪都没见到过。”","“But, Jack, you know very well that these goblins exist only in your imagination, and that, since the works here have been reopened, not a single one has been seen.”"
"“的确那样，哈里。但就算没有见到精灵，我们也没看到能让这些奇怪的事情水落石出的任何其他人。","“That’s true, Harry; but if no spirits have been seen, neither has anyone else to whom you could attribute the extraordinary doings we want to account for.”"
"“我会找出他们的。”","“I shall discover them.”"
"“噢，哈里！哈里！要抓住新阿伯福伊尔的精灵们可不容易啊！”","“Ah, Harry!Harry!It’s not so easy to catch the spirits of New Aberfoyle!”"
"“我会找到你所说的那些精灵。”哈里用一种坚定不移的语气说道。","“I shall find out the spirits as you call them,” said Harry, In a tone of firm conviction."
"“你认为你有能力惩治它们吗？”“既要惩治他们也要奖赏他们。记住，一只手将我们困在那条通道里，另一只手则解救了我们！我不会这么快忘记的。”","“Do you expect to be able to punish them?”“Both punish and reward.Remember, if one hand shut us up in that passage, another hand delivered us!I shall not soon forget that.”"
"“但是，哈里，你如何确信这两只手不会是属于同一个人呢？”","“But, Harry, how can we be sure that these two hands do not belong to the same body?”"
"“是什么让你产生这种想法的呢，杰克？”哈里问道。","“What can put such a notion in your head, Jack?” asked Harry."
"“嗯，我不知道。生活在这些洞里的生物，哈里，难道你不明白吗？他们不可能和我们一样，明白吗？”","“Well, I don’t know.Creatures that live in these holes, Harry, don’t you see? they can’t be made like us, eh?”"
"“但是他们确实和我们一样，杰克。”","“But they are just like us, Jack.”"
"“噢，不！别那么说，哈里！“也许，某个疯子设法来过这儿一次。”","“Oh, no! don’t say that, Harry!Perhaps some madman managed to get in for a time.”"
"“一个疯子！疯子不会有这样环环相扣的计划，也不会在毁掉梯子后不停地伤害我们。”","“A madman!No madman would have formed such connected plans, or done such continued mischief as befell us after the breaking of the ladders.”"
"“好吧，但不管怎样，在最近三年里，他没有伤害过你，哈里，或是你身边的任何人。”","“Well, but anyhow he has done no harm for the last three years, either to you, Harry, or any of your people.”"
"“没关系，杰克，”哈里回答道，“我相信这个心怀恶意的生灵，无论是谁，绝没有放弃他的恶意。我很难解释是什么让我坚信这些。但不管怎么样，为了新的工程，我必须要知道他是谁以及他从哪儿来。”","“No matter, Jack,” replied Harry; “I am persuaded that this malignant being, whoever he is, has by no means given up his evil intentions.I can hardly say on what I found my convictions.But at any rate, for the sake of the new works, I must and will know who he is and whence he comes.”"
"“你是说为了新的工程？”杰克非常惊讶地问道。","“For the sake of the new works did you say?” asked Jack, considerably surprised."
"“我是这么说的，杰克，”哈里回答道，“我可能弄错了。但是，在我看来，所发生的一切证明在这个煤矿里有人想与我们背道而驰。这个问题我考虑了很久，我几乎可以确信。想想这一连串无法解释的状况竟如此不可思议地联系在一起。一开始，那封与我父亲的信相矛盾的匿名信马上可证明某个人已经察觉到我们的计划，并试图阻碍计划的完成。斯塔尔先生前来多查特矿井看我们。他和我一走进矿井，一块巨大的石头就朝我们扔来，并且，亚罗井的梯子也被毁掉了，切断了通道。我们开始勘探。一项可以证明新矿脉存在的实验由于裂缝被堵上而无法进行。尽管如此，我们仍进行了检测，发现了矿脉。我们按原路返回时，遇到了一股巨大的气流，我们的灯摔坏了，我们彻底陷入黑暗中。尽管如此，我们沿着黑暗的通道前行，到达入口处时才发现入口被堵住了。就在那儿，我们被困住了。现在，杰克，从所有这些事情中，你难道看不出一个邪恶的意图吗？啊，是的，相信我，某个至今仍然隐形的生灵隐藏在煤矿里，但并不是你所坚持认为的超自然生灵。出于某种只有他本人知道的原因，他竭力阻止我们进入煤矿。我说的是“过去在那儿”吗？我内心确定他仍然在那儿，并可能为我们策划着某个可怕的灾难。即使冒着生命危险，杰克，我也一定要找出他。”","“I said so, Jack,” returned Harry.“I may be mistaken, but, to me, all that has happened proves the existence of an interest in this mine in strong opposition to ours.Many a time have I considered the matter; I feel almost sure of it.Just consider the whole series of inexplicable circumstances, so singularly linked together.To begin with, the anonymous letter, contradictory to that of my father, at once proves that some man had become aware of our projects, and wished to prevent their accomplishment.Mr. Starr comes to see us at the Dochart pit.No sooner does he enter it with me than an immense stone is cast upon us, and communication is interrupted by the breaking of the ladders in the Yarrow shaft.We commence exploring.An experiment, by which the existence of a new vein would be proved, is rendered impossible by stoppage of fissures.Notwithstanding this, the examination is carried out, the vein discovered.We return as we came, a prodigious gust of air meets us, our lamp is broken, utter darkness surrounds us.Nevertheless, we make our way along the gloomy passage until, on reaching the entrance, we find it blocked up.There we were—imprisoned.Now, Jack, don’t you see in all these things a malicious intention?Ah, yes, believe me, some being hitherto invisible, but not supernatural, as you will persist in thinking, was concealed in the mine.For some reason, known only to himself, he strove to keep us out of it.WAS there, did I say?I feel an inward conviction that he is there still, and probably prepares some terrible disaster for us.Even at the risk of my life, Jack, I am resolved to discover him.”"
"哈里说话时口吻极为认真，深深地震撼了他的同伴。“好吧，哈里，”他说道，“如果非得要我同意你的一些观点的话，难道你不承认那些给你送去面包和水的某个妖精或棕仙，是一个——”","Harry spoke with an earnestness which strongly impressed his companion.“Well, Harry,” said he, “if I am forced to agree with you in certain points, won’t you admit that some kind fairy or brownie, by bringing bread and water to you, was the means of—” "
"“杰克，我的朋友，”哈里打断他的话，“我相信煤矿里存在着一个你坚持称它是精灵的好人，就像我们提到的那个坏蛋一样，肯定是存在的，而我打算在煤矿的尽头找到他们。”","“Jack, my friend,” interrupted Harry, “it is my belief that the friendly person, whom you will persist in calling a spirit, exists in the mine as certainly as the criminal we speak of, and I mean to seek them both in the most distant recesses of the mine.”"
"“但是，”杰克问道，“你有任何可能的线索去进行搜寻吗？”","“But,” inquired Jack, “have you any possible clew to guide your search?”"
"“我可能有吧。听我说！新阿伯福伊尔往西五英里处，有块支撑着本洛蒙德山峰的坚固岩石，岩石下有一个天然的井，它垂直下到矿脉深处。一星期前我弄清了这个井的深度。在探测矿井时，当我俯下身往下放铅垂线时，似乎感觉到里面的空气被搅动了，就像被巨大的翅膀拍击过一样。”","“Perhaps I have.Listen to me!Five miles west of New Aberfoyle, under the solid rock which supports Ben Lomond, there exists a natural shaft which descends perpendicularly into the vein beneath.A week ago I went to ascertain the depth of this shaft.While sounding it, and bending over the opening as my plumb-line went down, it seemed to me that the air within was agitated, as though beaten by huge wings.”"
"“肯定是某种鸟在下面的水平巷道里迷路了。”杰克回答道。","“Some bird must have got lost among the lower galleries,” replied Jack."
"“但那还没完，杰克。今天早上我回到那个地方，很专注地听了听，我想我察觉到了某种类似呻吟的声音。”","“But that is not all, Jack.This very morning I went back to the place, and, listening attentively, I thought I could detect a sound like a sort of groaning.”"
"“呻吟！”杰克叫道，“那肯定是瞎扯，那是一股气流——除非确定是某个幽灵——”","“Groaning!” cried Jack, “that must be nonsense; it was a current of air—unless indeed some ghost—” "
"“我明天就会知道那是什么了。”哈里说道。","“I shall know to-morrow what it was,” said Harry."
"“明天？”杰克看着他的朋友问道。","“To-morrow?” answered Jack, looking at his friend."
"“是的，明天我会下到那个深井里去。”","“Yes; to-morrow I am going down into that abyss.”"
"“哈里！那将是上苍的诱惑。”","“Harry! that will be a tempting of Providence.”"
"“不，杰克，上苍会在我努力的过程中帮助我的。明天，你和我们几个同伴随我一起去那个井。我会在我身上系一根长绳子，你们可以用绳子把我放下去，并在我发出信号后把我拉上来。我可以信赖你吧，杰克？”","“No, Jack, Providence will aid me in the attempt.Tomorrow, you and some of our comrades will go with me to that shaft.I will fasten myself to a long rope, by which you can let me down, and draw me up at a given signal.I may depend upon you, Jack?”"
"“好吧，哈里，”杰克摇着头说道，“我会按你的想法去做，但同时我要告诉你，你的确错了。”","“Well, Harry,” said Jack, shaking his head, “I will do as you wish me; but I tell you all the same, you are very wrong.”"
"“不冒险就不会有所得。”哈里用一种坚定的口吻说道，“那么，明早六点。别惊动别人，再见了！”","“Nothing venture nothing win,” said Harry, in a tone of decision.“To-morrow morning, then, at six o’clock.Be silent, and farewell!”"
"必须承认杰克·瑞安的担忧并不是毫无根据的。如果要寻找的敌人就隐藏在他即将要下去的矿井底部，哈里将会置身于极度的危险之中。尽管这种可能性似乎并不大。","It must be admitted that Jack Ryan’s fears were far from groundless.Harry would expose himself to very great danger, supposing the enemy he sought for lay concealed at the bottom of the pit into which he was going to descend.It did not seem likely that such was the case, however."
"“究竟为什么，”杰克．瑞安反复说道，“他要不厌其烦地弄清这些事情？这些事情用煤矿里超自然力的介入就非常容易而简单地解释清楚。”","“Why in the world,” repeated Jack Ryan, “should he take all this trouble to account for a set of facts so very easily and simply explained by the supernatural intervention of the spirits of the mine?”"
"但是，尽管他反对这样的安排，第二天早上，杰克·瑞安和他队里的三名矿工还是跟着哈里到达了那个可疑的井口。哈里对詹姆斯·斯塔尔和老工头都没提过他的打算。杰克十分谨慎，什么也没有说。","But, notwithstanding his objections to the scheme, Jack Ryan and three miners of his gang arrived next morning with Harry at the mouth of the opening of the suspicious shaft.Harry had not mentioned his intentions either to James Starr or to the old overman.Jack had been discreet enough to say nothing."
"哈里在自己身上系了一根长约两百英尺的绳子。这根绳子并不是特别粗，但非常结实——足够承受他的重量。他的朋友们将要把他下放到深坑里，他拉拉绳子便是把他拉回去的信号。","Harry had provided himself with a rope about 200 feet long.It was not particularly thick, but very strong—sufficiently so to sustain his weight.His friends were to let him down into the gulf, and his pulling the cord was to be the signal to withdraw him."
"通向这个矿井或水井的开口宽十二英尺。一根梁就像一座桥那样横在那里，这样搭在梁上的绳子就能悬吊在洞口中央，并可避免哈里在下沉的过程中撞到四壁。","The opening into this shaft or well was twelve feet wide.A beam was thrown across like a bridge, so that the cord passing over it should hang down the center of the opening, and save Harry from striking against the sides in his descent."
"他准备好了。","He was ready."
"“你仍然决定要去勘探这个深井吗？”杰克·瑞安低声说道。","“Are you still determined to explore this abyss?” whispered Jack Ryan."
"“是的，我决定了，杰克。”","“Yes, I am, Jack.”"
"绳子绕在哈里的大腿上和胳膊下，以避免他摇晃。他就被这样支撑着，并且能自由地使用他的双手。他的腰带上挂着一盏安全灯和一把装在皮套里的锋利大刀。","The cord was fastened round Harry’s thighs and under his arms, to keep him from rocking.Thus supported, he was free to use both his hands.A safety-lamp hung at his belt, also a large, strong knife in a leather sheath."
"哈里往前走到梁的中间，梁上绕着绳子。随后，他的朋友们开始放他下去，他缓缓地下沉到矿井里。由于绳子的缘故，他一圈圈地轻轻晃动，他的灯光依次落在了整面侧壁上，这使他能仔细地检查。这些岩壁由矿井的煤构成，很光滑，以至于人无法在上面攀爬。","Harry advanced to the middle of the beam, around which the cord was passed.Then his friends began to let him down, and he slowly sank into the pit.As the rope caused him to swing gently round and round, the light of his lamp fell in turns on all points of the side walls, so that he was able to examine them carefully.These walls consisted of pit coal, and so smooth that it would be impossible to ascend them."
"哈里估算他正以每秒一英尺的速度下滑，因此他有时间来留意他的四周，并准备应对任何事件。","Harry calculated that he was going down at the rate of about a foot per second, so that he had time to look about him, and be ready for any event."
"两分钟内——也就是说，当他下滑到一百二十英尺深处时，没有任何意外发生。","During two minutes—that is to say, to the depth of about 120 feet, the descent continued without any incident."
"没有从矿井侧壁上凿出来的侧水平巷道，岩壁逐渐变窄，成了漏斗状。但哈里开始感觉到一股较新鲜的空气从下面升上来，他由此断定，矿井底部与煤矿最低处的某条水平巷道相通。","No lateral gallery opened from the side walls of the pit, which was gradually narrowing into the shape of a funnel.But Harry began to feel a fresher air rising from beneath, whence he concluded that the bottom of the pit communicated with a gallery of some description in the lowest part of the mine."
"绳子继续向下放。四周一片漆黑和死寂。如果有任何活着的生灵在这个幽深而神秘的深井里寻求庇护，那么无论是离开还是呆在这里，他的任何活动都不会丝毫暴露他的存在。","The cord continued to unwind.Darkness and silence were complete.If any living being whatever had sought refuge in the deep and mysterious abyss, he had either left it, or, if there, by no movement did he in the slightest way betray his presence."
"哈里越往下去越觉得可疑，现在他抽出刀握在右手里。在一百八十英尺深的地方，他的脚触碰到了底部，绳子也松了，没有再往下沉。","Harry, becoming more suspicious the lower he got, now drew his knife and held it in his right hand.At a depth of 180 feet, his feet touched the lower point and the cord slackened and unwound no further."
"哈里更为顺畅地呼吸了片刻。他曾担心的一点是，在他下滑过程中，绳子会在他上方被剪断。但是，他没有在井壁上看到任何可能隐藏在井壁后的人影。","Harry breathed more freely for a moment.One of the fears he entertained had been that, during his descent, the cord might be cut above him, but he had seen no projection from the walls behind which anyone could have been concealed."
"深井的底部很干燥。哈里把灯从他腰带上取下来，绕这个地方走了一圈，意识到他的猜测是正确的。","The bottom of the abyss was quite dry.Harry, taking the lamp from his belt, walked round the place, and perceived he had been right in his conjectures."
"一条极其狭窄的通道从旁边通向矿井外。他不得不弯下腰来往里看，并只能顺着通道爬进去。但因为他想看看通道通往哪个方向，是否通向另一个深渊，于是他趴在地上开始用手和膝盖往前爬。","An extremely narrow passage led aside out of the pit.He had to stoop to look into it, and only by creeping could it be followed; but as he wanted to see in which direction it led, and whether another abyss opened from it, he lay down on the ground and began to enter it on hands and knees."
"很快，一个障碍物阻挡了他的前进。他摸了摸，猜想是一具人的身体躺在通道中。一阵惊恐突然袭来，使他立刻退了退，但他又一次前行，并更小心地摸索着。","An obstacle speedily arrested his progress.He fancied he could perceive by touching it, that a human body lay across the passage.A sudden thrill of horror and surprise made him hastily draw back, but he again advanced and felt more carefully."
"他的感觉没有欺骗他，的确有一个人躺在那儿。尽管四肢冰凉，但他很快弄清那个人身上仍有生命的热度。哈里没花多少时间来进行判断便把那个人从井底深处拖了出来。他抓起他的灯，把灯光投向他发现的东西上，立刻惊叫道，“哎呀，是个孩子！”","His senses had not deceived him; a body did indeed lie there; and he soon ascertained that, although icy cold at the extremities, there was some vital heat remaining.In less time than it takes to tell it, Harry had drawn the body from the recess to the bottom of the shaft, and, seizing his lamp, he cast its lights on what he had found, exclaiming immediately, “Why, it is a child!”"
"孩子仍有呼吸，但非常微弱，以至于哈里认为他的呼吸会随时停止。片刻都不能耽搁，他必须把这个可怜的小家伙带出矿井，并尽快带他回到他母亲身边。他急忙把绳子系在他的腰上，卡住灯，用他的左臂把那个孩子紧紧地抱在他的胸前，并腾出他的右手来握住刀。他发出之前说好的信号，拉了拉绳子。","The child still breathed, but so very feebly that Harry expected it to cease every instant.Not a moment was to be lost; he must carry this poor little creature out of the pit, and take it home to his mother as quickly as he could.He eagerly fastened the cord round his waist, stuck on his lamp, Clasped the child to his breast with his left arm, and, keeping his right hand free to hold the knife, he gave the signal agreed on, to have the rope pulled up."
"绳子马上收紧，他开始往上升。哈里加倍小心地留意着四周，因为现在处在危险中的并不只是他自己。","It tightened at once; he began the ascent.Harry looked around him with redoubled care, for more than his own life was now in danger."
"上升的途中只花了几分钟时间，一切顺利，似乎没遭到任何事故的威胁。这时他突然听到从下面传来一阵极大的气流声。往下看时，他在黑暗中隐约觉察到有一个大大的物体在上升，并超过了他；那个物体一边往上升一边攻击他。","For a few minutes all went well, no accident seemed to threaten him, when suddenly he heard the sound of a great rush of air from beneath; and, looking down, he could dimly perceive through the gloom a broad mass arising until it passed him, striking him as it went by."
"这是一只巨大的鸟——他没见过的种类。它凭借有力的翅膀往上飞，随后停下，盘旋着，猛地向下冲向哈里，而哈里只能挥动着手里的刀。他尽力保护着自己和那个孩子，但是这只凶猛的鸟似乎总是朝他一人进攻。由于害怕绳子会被弄断，哈里不能随意攻击它。哈里一边持续着战斗，一边竭尽全力大叫着，希望他的朋友们可以听见。","It was an enormous bird—of what sort he could not see; it flew upwards on mighty wings, then paused, hovered, and dashed fiercely down upon Harry, who could only wield his knife in one hand.He defended himself and the child as well as he could, but the ferocious bird seemed to aim all its blows at him alone.Afraid of cutting the cord, he could not strike it as he wished, and the struggle was prolonged, while Harry shouted with all his might in hopes of making his comrades hear."
"他很快知道他们听见了，因为他们向上拉绳子的速度更快了；距上面还有大约八十英尺的。那只鸟停止了直接攻击，但却冲向绳子，并附在他够不到的地方猛啄绳子，竭力要啄断它。这使哈里的处境更加恐怖和危险了。","He soon knew they did, for they pulled the rope up faster; a distance of about eighty feet remained to be got over.The bird ceased its direct attack, but increased the horror and danger of his situation by rushing at the cord, clinging to it just out of his reach, and endeavoring, by pecking furiously, to cut it."
"哈里感受到极度的恐惧。绳子中的一股断了，他们下沉了一些。","Harry felt overcome with terrible dread.One strand of the rope gave way, and it made them sink a little."
"一声绝望的尖叫从他嘴里发出。","A shriek of despair escaped his lips."
"第二股也断开了，现在两个人的重量暂时悬吊在半根绳子上。","A second strand was divided, and the double burden now hung suspended by only half the cord."
"哈里扔掉他的刀，在绳子断掉的瞬间用超常的力量成功地用右手抓住了被鸟喙啄断的绳子的上半截。但是，尽管他用力抓着绳子，他仍能感觉到绳子从他指间一点一点地往下滑。","Harry dropped his knife, and by a superhuman effort succeeded, at the moment the rope was giving way, in catching hold of it with his right hand above the cut made by the beak of the bird.But, powerfully as he held it in his iron grasp, he could feel it gradually slipping through his fingers."
"他本可以用他的双手来抓住绳子，但那样他左臂里的孩子就会丧命。他有过这个想法，但他立刻打消了，尽管他清楚自己不可能坚持到被拖到地上的时候。他闭了一会儿眼睛，以为他们即将掉回到深井里。","He might have caught it, and held on with both hands by sacrificing the life of the child he supported in his left arm.The idea crossed him, but was banished in an instant, although he believed himself quite unable to hold out until drawn to the surface.For a second he closed his eyes, believing they were about to plunge back into the abyss."
"他再一次往上看，大鸟消失了。他的手握着断开的绳子的最末端——正当他抽搐的手快要没力时，他被同伴们抓住了，和那个孩子一起被放在了地上。","He looked up once more; the huge bird had disappeared; his hand was at the very extremity of the broken rope—when, just as his convulsive grasp was failing, he was seized by the men, and with the child was placed on the level ground."
"可怕的紧张焦虑消除了，哈里反应了过来，接着昏倒在他朋友们的怀中。","The fearful strain of anxiety removed, a reaction took place, and Harry fell fainting into the arms of his friends."
"第十二章 被收养的内尔","CHAPTER XII NELL ADOPTED"
"两小时之后，还没清醒的哈里和仍然虚弱的孩子被杰克·瑞安和他的同伴们带回了村舍。当老工头听他们讲述冒险经历时，马奇精心照料着儿子和被他从煤矿里救回来的那个可怜人，尽力满足他们的需求。","A couple of hours later, Harry still unconscious, and the child in a very feeble state, were brought to the cottage by Jack Ryan and his companions.The old overman listened to the account of their adventures, while Madge attended with the utmost care to the wants of her son, and of the poor creature whom he had rescued from the pit."
"哈里以为她只是一个孩子，但她却是一个十五六岁的少女。","Harry imagined her a mere child, but she was a maiden of the age of fifteen or sixteen years."
"她用茫然而好奇的眼神盯着他们。她那因苦难而消瘦的脸、可能因从未见过阳光而苍白的脸色，以及那虚弱纤细的身材，立即使她显得与众不同而引人注意。杰克·瑞安声称，在他看来这个女孩就像是一个极其有趣的幽灵。","She gazed at them with vague and wondering eyes; and the thin face, drawn by suffering, the pallid complexion, which light could never have tinged, and the fragile, slender figure, gave her an appearance at once singular and attractive.Jack Ryan declared that she seemed to him to be an uncommonly interesting kind of ghost."
"一定是由于她一直都生活在一种异常奇怪的环境中，所以她似乎根本不属于人类。她的面容有一种不寻常的特征，她那几乎不能忍受村舍灯光的眼睛困惑地打量着四周。在她眼里似乎一切都是新奇的。","It must have been due to the strange and peculiar circumstances under which her life hitherto had been led, that she scarcely seemed to belong to the human race.Her countenance was of a very uncommon cast, and her eyes, hardly able to bear the lamp-light in the cottage, glanced around in a confused and puzzled way, as if all were new to them."
"这个奇特的人躺在马奇的床上，像从一次长长的睡眠中苏醒过来一样。这时，这个苏格兰老妇人开始问她一些问题。","As this singular being reclined on Madge’s bed and awoke to consciousness, as from a long sleep, the old Scotchwoman began to question her a little."
"“他们怎么称呼你，亲爱的？”她说。","“What do they call you, my dear?” said she."
"“内尔。”女孩回答道。","“Nell.” replied the girl."
"“你觉得哪儿不舒服吗，内尔？”","“Do you feel anything the matter with you, Nell?”"
"“我饿了。我一直没吃东西，自从——自从——”。","“I am hungry.I have eaten nothing since—since—”."
"内尔说了这几句话，像一个不善言辞的人。这几句话是盖尔语，西蒙和他的家人经常讲这种语言。马奇立即给她拿来一些食物；她显然饿极了。人们无从得知她在矿井里呆了多久。","Nell uttered these few words like one unused to speak much.They were in the Gaelic language, which was often spoken by Simon and his family.Madge immediately brought her some food; she was evidently famished.It was impossible to say how long she might have been in that pit."
"“你在那下面呆了多少天，亲爱的？”马奇询问道。","“How many days had you been down there, dearie?” inquired Madge."
"内尔没有回答，她似乎不理解这个问题。","Nell made no answer; she seemed not to understand the question."
"“你认为有多少天啊？”","“How many days, do you think?”"
"“天？”内尔重复道，似乎这个词对她没有任何意义。她摇摇头表明她根本不理解。","“Days?” repeated Nell, as though the word had no meaning for her, and she shook her head to signify entire want of comprehension."
"马奇握着她的手，亲切地抚摸着。“你多大了，我的姑娘？”她问道，朝内尔和蔼地笑着。","Madge took her hand, and stroked it caressingly.“How old are you, my lassie?” she asked, smiling kindly at her."
"内尔又摇了摇头。","Nell shook her head again."
"“是啊，是啊，”马奇继续问道，“多少岁了？”","“Yes, yes,” continued Madge, “how many years old?”"
"“岁？”内尔回答道。她似乎像不理解“天”一样也不理解这个词！西蒙、哈里、杰克和其他人在一旁看着，表情里夹杂着同情、好奇和怜悯。这个可怜人身穿一件粗糙的劣质毛纺衣，她的境况似乎令他们伤感。","“Years?” replied Nell.She seemed to understand that word no better than days!Simon, Harry, Jack, and the rest, looked on with an air of mingled compassion, wonder, and sympathy.The state of this poor thing, clothed in a miserable garment of coarse woolen stuff, seemed to impress them painfully."
"比起其他所有人，哈里似乎更为这个可怜陌生人的特质所吸引。他走近些，从他母亲手里托起内尔的手，眼睛直直地看着她，这时内尔的嘴角翘了翘，像是在微笑。“内尔，”哈里说，“内尔，在那下边——煤矿里——你一直都是独自一人吗？”","Harry, more than all the rest, seemed attracted by the very peculiarity of this poor stranger.He drew near, took Nell’s hand from his mother, and looked directly at her, while something like a smile curved her lip.“Nell,” he said, “Nell, away down there—in the mine—were you all alone?”"
"“独自一人！独自一人！”女孩大叫着，匆匆站起来。她流露出恐惧的神情，原本因哈里的注视而显得柔和的眼睛再次变得非常狂野。“独自一人！”她重复地说道，“独自一人！”——然后她倒在了床上，似乎耗尽了所有的力气。","“Alone! Alone!” cried the girl, raising herself hastily.Her features expressed terror; her eyes, which had appeared to soften as Harry looked at her, became quite wild again.“Alone!” repeated she, “alone!”—and she fell back on the bed, as though deprived of all strength."
"“这个可怜的小孩太虚弱了，还不能和我们说话。”马奇边说边摆好枕头。“等她休息好，多吃一点食物后，她会有力气些。走吧，西蒙和哈里，还有你们大家，让她睡觉。”这样就剩下内尔一个人了，没过几分钟她就沉沉地睡着了。","“The poor bairn is too weak to speak to us.” said Madge, when she had adjusted the pillows.“After a good rest, and a little more food, she will be stronger.Come away, Simon and Harry, and all the rest of you, and let her go to sleep.”So Nell was left alone, and in a very few minutes slept profoundly."
"这件事情不仅在煤矿里，而且在斯特林郡都引起了极大的轰动，最终传遍了整个王国。这个故事的离奇性被夸大了。如果他们知道女孩被发现时是困在坚硬岩石里的，就像那些上古时期的生物偶然间被人们用鹤嘴锄从桎梏它们的石头中解救出来一样，这件事就不会引起这么大的骚动了。内尔在浑然不知的情况下，成为了一个人人皆知的奇迹。迷信的人们使内尔的故事成为他们传奇事迹里的一个新话题，他们都倾向于认为，就像杰克·瑞安告诉哈里的那样，内尔是这个煤矿里的幽灵。","This event caused a great sensation, not only in the coalmines, but in Stirlingshire, and ultimately throughout the kingdom.The strangeness of the story was exaggerated; the affair could not have made more commotion had they found the girl enclosed in the solid rock, like one of those antediluvian creatures who have occasionally been released by a stroke of the pickax from their stony prison.Nell became a fashionable wonder without knowing it.Superstitious folks made her story a new subject for legendary marvels, and were inclined to think, as Jack Ryan told Harry, that Nell was the spirit of the mines."
"“就这样吧，杰克,”年轻的哈里说道，“但无论怎样她是一个好幽灵。当我们被困在下面时，只有她给我们带来面包和水，不可能是其他的人；至于邪恶的幽灵，他一定还在煤矿里，总有一天我们会捉住他的。”","“Be it so, Jack,” said the young man, “but at any rate she is the good spirit.It can have been none but she who brought us bread and water when we were shut up down there; and as to the bad spirit, who must still be in the mine, we’ll catch him some day.”"
"当然，詹姆斯·斯塔尔立即知道了这一切。当年轻的女孩充分恢复体力后，他就来看她了，并小心地试着问她问题。","Of course James Starr had been at once informed of all this, and came, as soon as the young girl had sufficiently recovered her strength, to see her, and endeavor to question her carefully."
"尽管她很聪慧，但她几乎对与生活相关的所有事都显得一无所知，缺少许多基本的概念，比如时间。她从不习惯时间的划分，对表示小时、日、月和年的这些词一概不知。","She appeared ignorant of nearly everything relating to life, and, although evidently intelligent, was wanting in many elementary ideas, such as time, for instance.She had never been used to its division, and the words signifying hours, days, months, and years were unknown to her."
"她的眼睛习惯了黑夜的环境，电盘的刺眼光亮会将它们灼痛；但在黑暗里她的视觉特别敏锐，瞳孔张得异常大，可以看见其他人看来非常模糊的地方。可以肯定的是，她的大脑从未对外部世界留有任何印象，她的眼界也从未超出过煤矿，那些阴暗的深处一直是她的整个世界。","Her eyes, accustomed to the night, were pained by the glare of the electric discs; but in the dark her sight was wonderfully keen, the pupil dilated in a remarkable manner, and she could see where to others there appeared profound obscurity.It was certain that her brain had never received any impression of the outer world, that her eyes had never looked beyond the mine, and that these somber depths had been all the world to her."
"这个可怜的女孩可能不知道有太阳和繁星、城镇和乡郡，以及由无数天体构成的浩瀚宇宙。但是，只有当她理解了目前对她而言还没有确切意义的单词含义后，她才有可能弄清她知道什么。至于内尔是否独自生活在新阿伯福伊尔的幽深处，詹姆斯·斯塔尔不得不留着这个疑问；的确，任何关于这个话题的暗示显然都会在这个奇怪女孩的脑中激起恐慌。内尔不是不会回答就是不愿回答这些问题。但有一点很清楚，那就是这个地方存在一个她本可以解释的秘密。","The poor girl probably knew not that there were a sun and stars, towns and counties, a mighty universe composed of myriads of worlds.But until she comprehended the significance of words at present conveying no precise meaning to her, it was impossible to ascertain what she knew.As to whether or not Nell had lived alone in the recesses of New Aberfoyle, James Starr was obliged to remain uncertain; indeed, any allusion to the subject excited evident alarm in the mind of this strange girl.Either Nell could not or would not reply to questions, but that some secret existed in connection with the place, which she could have explained, was manifest."
"“你愿意和我们住在一起吗？还是愿意回到我们发现你的那个地方呢？”詹姆斯·斯塔尔问道。","“Should you like to stay with us?Should you like to go back to where we found you?” asked James Starr."
"“噢，愿意！”少女大声回答了他的第一个问题，对于第二个问题她只能以一声惊叫来回答。","“Oh, yes!” exclaimed the maiden, in answer to his first question; but a cry of terror was all she seemed able to say to the second."
"对于这种持续的沉默，詹姆斯·斯塔尔，以及西蒙·福特和哈里·福特都不由自主地感到某种强烈的不安。他们发现，要想忘记发现煤矿时所出现的那些费解的事情是不可能的；虽然已经是三年前的事了，并且迄今没有任何新的事件发生，但他们一直有预感，那个隐形的敌人会发动新的攻击。","James Starr, as well as Simon and Harry Ford, could not help feeling a certain amount of uneasiness with regard to this persistent silence.They found it impossible to forget all that had appeared so inexplicable at the time they made the discovery of the coal mine; and although that was three years ago, and nothing new had happened, they always expected some fresh attack on the part of the invisible enemy."
"他们决定去勘探那口神秘的井，并且也装备齐全地带着一大帮人去了。但是没有看见任何可疑的迹象。那口井和从含碳煤床中挖出的矿井的下面几层相连通。","They resolved to explore the mysterious well, and did so, well armed and in considerable numbers.But nothing suspicious was to be seen; the shaft communicated with lower stages of the crypt, hollowed out in the carboniferous bed."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔、西蒙以及哈里多次谈论这些事情。如果有一个或多个心怀恶意的人隐藏在矿井里，并在那里使坏，内尔肯定会提醒他们的，但她却什么都没说。哪怕关于她过去生活的一点点暗示都会让她产生极大的情绪波动，他们认为现在最好避开这个话题。她的秘密将来肯定会显露出来。","Many a time did James Starr, Simon, and Harry talk over these things.If one or more malevolent beings were concealed in the coal-pit, and there concocted mischief, Nell surely could have warned them of it, yet she said nothing.The slightest allusion to her past life brought on such fits of violent emotion, that it was judged best to avoid the subject for the present.Her secret would certainly escape her by-and-by."
"当内尔到村舍两周后，她已经成为老马奇非常聪明和热心的帮手了。显然，内尔凭直觉认为她应该继续留在住所里，在这里她受到了很友善的接待，也许她从未想过离开这里。这一家就是她的全部，对那些善良的人而言，从内尔第一次进入他们屋的那一刻起，她似乎已经是他们收养的孩子了。内尔真的是一个迷人的人。新的生活方式使她更美丽了，毋庸置疑，这是她生命中第一次觉得快乐，她内心对那些帮助过她的人充满了感激。马奇像母亲一样地对待她，这位老妇人宠爱着她。总之，每个人都喜爱她。杰克·瑞安只后悔一件事，就是没有亲自去救她。","By the time Nell had been a fortnight in the cottage, she had become a most intelligent and zealous assistant to old Madge.It was clear that she instinctively felt she should remain in the dwelling where she had been so charitably received, and perhaps never dreamt of quitting it.This family was all in all to her, and to the good folks themselves Nell had seemed an adopted child from the moment when she first came beneath their roof.Nell was in truth a charming creature; her new mode of existence added to her beauty, for these were no doubt the first happy days of her life, and her heart was full of gratitude towards those to whom she owed them.Madge felt towards her as a mother would; the old woman doted upon her; in short, she was beloved by everybody.Jack Ryan only regretted one thing, which was that he had not saved her himself."
"朋友杰克经常来村舍。以前从没听过歌声的内尔非常喜欢听他唱歌，但任何人都可以看出，与杰克的歌声相比，她更喜欢哈里严肃的谈话。从他那里她慢慢学到了关于外面世界的道理，那是她直到现在仍不了解的世界。","Friend Jack often came to the cottage.He sang, and Nell, who had never heard singing before, admired it greatly; but anyone might see that she preferred to Jack’s songs the graver conversation of Harry, from whom by degrees she learnt truths concerning the outer world, of which hitherto she had known nothing."
"可以肯定的是，自从内尔这个人出现后，杰克·瑞安不得不承认他对妖怪的迷信在一定程度上减弱了。几个月后，他的迷信想法遭到了进一步的打击。大约在那时，哈里有了意外的发现，这个发现至少在某种程度上解释了欧文邓唐纳德城堡废墟中火焰少女的奇怪现象。几天以来，哈里一直在勘探巨大洞穴内朝南的偏僻水平巷道。后来他费力地爬上了一条狭窄的通道，这条通道从上面的岩石中岔开。让他极其惊讶的是，他突然发现自己身在露天处。这条通道弯弯曲曲地延伸至地面，直达邓唐纳德城堡的废墟中。","It must be said that, since Nell had appeared in her own person, Jack Ryan had been obliged to admit that his belief in hobgoblins was in a measure weakened.A couple of months later his credulity experienced a further shock.About that time Harry unexpectedly made a discovery which, in part at least, accounted for the apparition of the fire-maidens among the ruins of Dundonald Castle at Irvine.During several days he had been engaged in exploring the remote galleries of the prodigious excavation towards the south.At last he scrambled with difficulty up a narrow passage which branched off through the upper rock.To his great astonishment, he suddenly found himself in the open air.The passage, after ascending obliquely to the surface of the ground, led out directly among the ruins of Dundonald Castle."
"因此，在新阿伯福伊尔和被古城堡围绕的这些山丘间存在着一个通道。这个水平巷道的上层入口被石头和灌木丛完全隐藏住，从外面是看不见的。因此，法官们在搜寻时什么也没能发现。","There was, therefore, a communication between New Aberfoyle and the hills crowned by this ancient castle.The upper entrance to this gallery, being completely concealed by stones and brushwood, was invisible from without; at the time of their search, therefore, the magistrates had been able to discover nothing."
"几天以后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔在哈里的指引下亲自来勘察这个通往煤矿的奇怪天然出口。“噢，”他说，“这足以说服我们中最迷信的人了。再见了，所有的棕仙、妖精，还有火焰少女！”","A few days afterwards, James Starr, guided by Harry, came himself to inspect this curious natural opening into the coal mine.“Well,” said he, “here is enough to convince the most superstitious among us.Farewell to all their brownies, goblins, and fire-maidens now!”"
"“斯塔尔先生，我并不认为我们应该自我祝贺。”哈里说道，“无论我们用什么来代替这些东西，情况都不会比它们更好，只可能更糟。”","“I hardly think, Mr. Starr, we ought to congratulate ourselves.” replied Harry.“Whatever it is we have instead of these things, it can’t be better, and may be worse than they are.”"
"“是的，哈里，”工程师说道，“但是要做些什么呢？很显然，无论是谁躲藏在煤矿里，他们都要经过这条通道到达地面。毋庸置疑，在那个风雨交加的黑夜，他们挥动着火把，正是火把的光亮将“穆塔拉”号引向岩石嶙嶙的岸边。若不是因为杰克·瑞安和他的朋友们，他们就会像以前的肇事者一样，可能已经掠夺了那艘不幸的轮船。总之，目前很明显，这里就是洞穴的入口。至于这儿的主人，问题是——他们还在这里吗?”","“That’s true, Harry,” said the engineer; “but what’s to be done?It is plain that, whatever the beings are who hide in the mine, they reach the surface of the earth by this passage.No doubt it was the light of torches waved by them during that dark and stormy night which attracted the Motala towards the rocky coast, and like the wreckers of former days, they would have plundered the unfortunate vessel, had it not been for Jack Ryan and his friends.Anyhow, so far it is evident, and here is the mouth of the den.As to its occupants, the question is—are they here still?”"
"“我说还在，因为当我们提到他们时内尔会颤抖——是的，因为内尔不会，或不敢谈论这些人。”哈里用一种坚定的口吻回答道。","“I say yes; because Nell trembles when we mention them—yes, because Nell will not, or dare not, speak about them,” answered Harry in a tone of decision."
"哈里肯定是对的。如果矿井里的神秘居客已经离开了它，或是不再来这里，这个女孩有什么理由保持沉默呢？","Harry was surely in the right.Had these mysterious denizens of the pit abandoned it, or ceased to visit the spot, what reason could the girl have had for keeping silence?"
"在詹姆斯·斯塔尔将这个神秘事件调查清楚之前，他没法歇息。根据他的预见，整个新的挖掘前景肯定取决于此。因此，人们采取了一些重新制定且严格的预防措施。有人告诉当局发现了这个入口。城堡废墟中安排了专人监察。哈里自己则在小山坡上浓密的灌木丛中潜伏了几个晚上。","James Starr could not rest till he had penetrated this mystery.He foresaw that the whole future of the new excavations must depend upon it.Renewed and strict precautions were therefore taken.The authorities were informed of the discovery of the entrance.Watchers were placed among the ruins of the castle.Harry himself lay hid for several nights in the thickets of brushwood which clothed the hill-side."
"什么也没发现——没人出现在那个洞口。因此大多数人得出结论，那些坏人最终被逐出了煤矿，而至于内尔，他们肯定认为她被遗弃在井底，并死在了那儿。","Nothing was discovered—no human being emerged from the opening.So most people came to the conclusion that the villains had been finally dislodged from the mine, and that, as to Nell, they must suppose her to be dead at the bottom of the shaft where they had left her."
"当煤矿没被开采时，它是一个足够安全的庇护所，那儿没有各种搜寻或追逐。但是现在情况变了，隐瞒这个藏身之处已非易事，那么倒不妨希望他们已经走了，以后再也不必害怕他们了；这是合情合理的。","While it remained unworked, the mine had been a safe enough place of refuge, secure from all search or pursuit.But now, circumstances being altered, it became difficult to conceal this lurking-place, and it might reasonably be hoped they were gone, and that nothing for the future was to be dreaded from them."
"可是，詹姆斯·斯塔尔对此并不确定，哈里对此也不满意。哈里经常反复说道,“内尔显然已卷进这整个秘密事件中。如果她没有其他可害怕的事情，那她为什么要保持沉默呢？毫无疑问，她和我们在一起很开心。她喜欢我们所有人——她喜爱我的母亲。她绝口不谈她以前的生活，若她一旦说出，可能对我们有帮助。在我看来，某个她不敢揭露的可怕秘密萦绕在她脑海中。也可能她认为她应该保持沉默，这样对我们和她都更好，尽管这在一定程度上难以理解。”","James Starr, however, could not feel sure about it; neither could Harry be satisfied on the subject, often repeating, “Nell has clearly been mixed up with all this secret business.If she had nothing more to fear, why should she keep silence?It cannot be doubted that she is happy with us.She likes us all—she adores my mother.Her absolute silence as to her former life, when by speaking out she might benefit us, proves to me that some awful secret, which she dares not reveal, weighs on her mind.It may also be that she believes it better for us, as well as for herself, that she should remain mute in a way otherwise so unaccountable.”"
"根据这些看法，大家达成共识，即避免任何有关这个少女从前生活方式的暗示被提及。然而，有一天詹姆斯·斯塔尔、哈里的父亲和母亲让哈里告诉内尔，他们以及哈里本人都很感激内尔的出现。","In consequence of these opinions, it was agreed by common consent to avoid all allusion to the maiden’s former mode of life.One day, however, Harry was led to make known to Nell what James Starr, his father, mother, and himself believed they owed to her interference."
"那天有游乐会。矿工们在斯特林郡地上和地下举行庆祝活动。成群结队的游人们四处参观。歌声在新阿伯福伊尔宏伟拱顶下的许多地方回荡着。哈里和内尔离开了村舍，沿着马尔科姆湖的左岸慢慢地行走着。","It was a fete-day.The miners made holiday on the surface of the county of Stirling as well as in its subterraneous domains.Parties of holiday-makers were moving about in all directions.Songs resounded in many places beneath the sonorous vaults of New Aberfoyle.Harry and Nell left the cottage, and slowly walked along the left bank of Loch Malcolm."
"那时射过来的电光不是很刺眼，一束束光线被别致的岩石的锋利棱角打断，产生了奇妙的效果。这些岩石支撑着穹顶。内尔的眼睛在强光下很不舒服，不过对这种不强烈的光线很适应。","Then the electric brilliance darted less vividly, and the rays were interrupted with fantastic effect by the sharp angles of the picturesque rocks which supported the dome.This imperfect light suited Nell, to whose eyes a glare was very unpleasant."
"“内尔，”哈里说道，“你的眼睛还不适应日光，忍受不了太阳光。”“确实不行，”内尔回答道，“如果太阳就像你所描述的那样的话，哈里。”","“Nell,” said Harry, “your eyes are not fit for daylight yet, and could not bear the brightness of the sun.”“Indeed they could not,” replied the girl; “if the sun is such as you describe it to me, Harry.”"
"“内尔，我无法用语言向你描述你从未见过的宇宙的壮观或美丽。但是告诉我，自从你在煤矿深处出生那天起，你就从未到过地面上，那真的可能吗？”","“I cannot by any words, Nell, give you an idea either of his splendoror of the beauty of that universe which your eyes have never beheld.But tell me, is it really possible that, since the day when you were born in the depths of the coal mine, you never once have been up to the surface of the earth?”"
"“一次都没有过，哈里，”她说道，“我认为，即使我还是婴儿时，我父亲或母亲都不曾带我到过那里。我肯定，如果他们带我去过，我应该会留有对外界的某些印象。”","“Never once, Harry,” said she; “I do not believe that, even as an infant, my father or mother ever carried me thither.I am sure I should have retained some impression of the open air if they had.”"
"“我相信你会的。”哈里回答道，“很久以前，内尔，有很多小孩一起住在这个煤矿里；当时交通极其困难，我遇到过不止一个年轻人，他们和你一样对地上的世界一无所知。但是现在，穿过我们大隧道的火车几分钟就能将我们带到这个郡的地面上。内尔，我渴望听你说，‘快来，哈里，我的眼睛可以忍受阳光的照射，我想看看太阳！我想看看造物主的杰作。’”","“I believe you would,” answered Harry.“Long ago, Nell, many children used to live altogether in the mine; communication was then difficult, and I have met with more than one young person, quite as ignorant as you are of things above-ground.But now the railway through our great tunnel takes us in a few minutes to the upper regions of our country.I long, Nell, to hear you say, ‘Come, Harry, my eyes can bear daylight, and I want to see the sun!I want to look upon the works of the Almighty.’”"
"“我很快就可以这样说了，哈里，但愿，”内尔回答道，“我很快就可以和你一起到上面的世界，但是——”","“I shall soon say so, Harry, I hope,” replied the girl, “I shall soon go with you to the world above; and yet—” "
"“你想说什么，内尔？”哈里急忙大喊道，“你是不是会后悔离开那个黑暗的深井？在那里你度过了人生的最初时光，也是在那里我们救出了奄奄一息的你。”","“What are you going to say, Nell?” hastily cried Harry; “can you possibly regret having quitted that gloomy abyss in which you spent your early years, and whence we drew you half dead?”"
"“不是的，哈里，”内尔回答道，“我只是觉得黑暗和光亮一样美。只有当你知道眼睛习惯了在黑暗中能看见一切时，你才会明白！影子一闪而过，人们喜欢追逐它们；光圈错综交织，人们可以一直盯着它们看；黑洞处在煤矿的底部，充斥着模糊不清的光线。而且还有像说话的声音！啊，哈里！只有在下面生活过的人才能明白我的感受，我永远无法表达出来。”","“No, Harry,” answered Nell, “I was only thinking that darkness is beautiful as well as light.If you but knew what eyes accustomed to its depth can see!Shades flit by, which one longs to follow; circles mingle and intertwine, and one could gaze on them forever; black hollows, full of indefinite gleams of radiance, lie deep at the bottom of the mine.And then the voice-like sounds!Ah, Harry!One must have lived down there to understand what I feel, what I can never express.”"
"“你不害怕吗，内尔，总是一个人在那里？”","“And were you not afraid, Nell, all alone there?”"
"“只有当我一个人的时候，我才不会害怕。”","“It was just when I was alone that I was not afraid.”"
"内尔说这些话时声音有点变化，但是哈里认为他可以在这个话题上更深入一些，因此他说：“但人是很容易在这些大水平巷道里迷路的，内尔。你不怕迷路吗？”","Nell’s voice altered slightly as she said these words; however, Harry thought he might press the subject a little further, so he said, “But one might be easily lost in these great galleries, Nell.Were you not afraid of losing your way?”"
"“噢，不怕，哈里，很久以前我就熟悉新煤矿里的每一个拐角了。”","“Oh, no, Harry; for a long time I had known every turn of the new mine.”"
"“你从来没离开过那里？”","“Did you never leave it?”"
"“不是，偶尔离开，”这个女孩有点犹豫地回答道，“有时，我最远到过阿伯福伊尔的老煤矿。”","“Yes, now and then,” answered the girl with a little hesitation, “sometimes I have been as far as the old mine of Aberfoyle.”"
"“这么说你知道我们的旧村舍？”","“So you knew our old cottage?”"
"“村舍！嗯，知道，但是我只是在很远的地方看见过住在那里的人。”","“The cottage! oh, yes; but the people who lived there I only saw at a great distance.”"
"“他们是我的父亲和母亲，”哈里说道，“还有我，我们一直住在那里——我们永远不会舍弃那个旧住所。”","“They were my father and mother,” said Harry; “and I was there too; we have always lived there—we never would give up the old dwelling.”"
"“那样的话，也许会对你们更好些。”女孩咕哝道。","“Perhaps it would have been better for you if you had,” murmured the maiden."
"“为什么这么说，内尔？不会只是因为我们固执地住在那里，最后发现了新的矿脉吧？难道这个发现没有带来好的结果吗？它给很多人提供了工作，使他们重新获得了舒适与安逸。难道不是它让我们找到了你、救了你，并给了你我们所有的爱吗，内尔？”","“Why so, Nell?Was it not just because we were obstinately resolved to remain that we ended by discovering the new vein of coal?And did not that discovery lead to the happy result of providing work for a large population, and restoring them to ease and comfort?And did it not enable us to find you, Nell, to save your life, and give you the love of all our hearts?”"
"“噢，是的，无论发生什么事，对我来说它的确是一件好事，”内尔真诚地回答道，“但是对其他人——谁说得准呢？”","“Ah, yes, for me indeed it is well, whatever may happen,” replied Nell earnestly; “for others—who can tell?”"
"“你是什么意思？”","“What do you mean?”"
"“噢，没事——没事。但以前进入那个新路堑是非常危险的——是的，的确非常危险，哈里！有一次，一些莽撞的人就闯进了这些裂隙。他们走了很远很远，后来迷路了！”","“Oh, nothing—nothing.But it used to be very dangerous at that time to go into the new cutting—yes, very dangerous indeed, Harry!Once some rash people made their way into these chasms.They got a long, long way; they were lost!”"
"“他们迷路了？”哈里看着内尔说道。","“They were lost?” said Harry, looking at her."
"“是的，迷路了！”内尔嗓音颤抖地重复道，“他们找不到出去的路了。”","“Yes, lost!” repeated Nell in a trembling voice.“They could not find their way out.”"
"“在那儿，”哈里大声地说道，“他们被困了八天之久！他们处在死亡的边缘，内尔，若不是一个善良仁慈的人——也许是一个天使——被上帝派来帮助他们，悄悄地给他们带来了一些食物，若不是这个神秘的向导给前来救他们的人带路，他们绝不可能逃出那个活坟墓！”","“And there,” cried Harry, “they were imprisoned during eight long days!They were at the point of death, Nell; and, but for a kind and charitable being—an angel perhaps—sent by God to help them, who secretly brought them a little food; but for a mysterious guide, who afterwards led to them their deliverers, they never would have escaped from that living tomb!”"
"“你是怎么知道这件事的？”女孩问道。","“And how do you know about that?” demanded the girl."
"“因为那些人就是詹姆斯·斯塔尔、我父亲和我，内尔！”","“Because those men were James Starr, my father, and myself, Nell!”"
"内尔急忙抬起头，紧紧地抓着他的手，目不转睛地盯着他，这激发了哈里内心深处的情感。“你在那里？”她终于说话了。","Nell looked up hastily, seized the young man’s hand, and gazed so fixedly into his eyes that his feelings were stirred to their depths.”“You were there?” at last she uttered."
"“我的确在，”哈里停顿了一会儿说道，“救我们性命的那个人除了你，不会是其他人，内尔！”","“I was indeed,” said Harry, after a pause, “and she to whom we owe our lives can have been none other than yourself, Nell!”"
"内尔用手捂着脸，不说话。哈里从未见过她如此动容。","Nell hid her face in her hands without speaking.Harry had never seen her so much affected."
"“那些救了你的人，内尔，”哈里用因激动而颤抖的声音补充说道，“他们的命是你救的，你认为他们会忘记吗？”","“Those who saved your life, Nell,” added he in a voice tremulous with emotion, “already owed theirs to you; do you think they will ever forget it?”"
"第十三章　在旋转梯上","CHAPTER XIII ON THE REVOLVING LADDER"
"新阿伯福伊尔的煤矿开采活动继续顺利地进行着。工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔和西蒙·福特发现了这块富含煤炭的地区，理所当然地从中分得了很大的利润。","The mining operations at New Aberfoyle continued to be carried on very successfully.As a matter of course, the engineer, James Starr, as well as Simon Ford, the discoverers of this rich carboniferous region, shared largely in the profits."
"后来，哈里成为了合伙人。但是他从来没想过离开这个村舍。他接替了他父亲的工头职务，孜孜不倦地监管着这群矿工的工作。杰克·瑞安为好运降到他朋友身上而感到自豪和高兴。他自己也过得非常好。","In time Harry became a partner.But he never thought of quitting the cottage.He took his father’s place as overman, and diligently superintended the works of this colony of miners.Jack Ryan was proud and delighted at the good fortune which had befallen his comrade.He himself was getting on very well also."
"他们经常碰面，不是在村舍就是在工作的矿井里。杰克并非没有觉察到哈里对内尔的感情。哈里不愿向他们坦白；当他摇头并试图否认他对内尔有任何特别的兴趣时，杰克只是笑笑他。","They frequently met, either at the cottage or at the works in the pit.Jack did not fail to remark the sentiments entertained by Harry towards Nell.Harry would not confess to them; but Jack only laughed at him when he shook his head and tried to deny any special interest in her."
"必须指出的是，杰克·瑞安最大的愿望可能就是当内尔第一次去斯特林郡地面上观光时，他可以加入他们。他希望看到内尔第一次看见她尚不知道的大自然面貌时，流露出惊奇和赞赏之情。他非常希望哈里在这样的一次短途旅行时会带上他。但是，哈里却一直没有向他提起这件事，这让杰克对自己的打算有点不安。","It must be noted that Jack Ryan had the greatest possible wish to be of the party when Nell should pay her first visit to the upper surface of the county of Stirling.He wished to see her wonder and admiration on first beholding the yet unknown face of Nature.He very much hoped that Harry would take him with them when the excursion was made.As yet, however, the latter had made no proposal of the kind to him, which caused him to feel a little uneasy as to his intentions."
"一天早上，杰克·瑞安正沿着连通地面和煤矿下层的矿井往下走。他顺着一架梯子往下走，这些梯子在机器的带动下持续不停地旋转，使人可以毫不费力地上升和下降。这个装置已经使他下降了大约一百五十英尺，这时他在一个狭窄的着陆处看见了哈里，哈里正往上去工作。","One morning Jack Ryan was descending through a shaft which led from the surface to the lower regions of the pit.He did so by means of one of those ladders which, continually revolving by machinery, enabled persons to ascend and descend without fatigue.This apparatus had lowered him about a hundred and fifty feet, when at a narrow landing-place he perceived Harry, who was coming up to his labors for the day."
"“真巧，我的朋友！”杰克喊道，借助电灯的光亮他认出了他的同伴。","“Well met, my friend!” cried Jack, recognizing his comarad by the light of the electric lamps."
"“嗨，杰克！”哈里回答道，“很高兴见到你。我有些建议。”","“Ah, Jack!” replied Harry, “I am glad to see you.I’ve got something to propose.”"
"“我什么也听不进去，除非你告诉我内尔最近如何。”杰克·瑞安打断他说道。","“I can listen to nothing till you tell me how Nell is.” interrupted Jack Ryan."
"“内尔很好，杰克——好得很，事实上，我希望在一个月或一个半月后——”","“Nell is all right, Jack—so much so, in fact, that I hope in a month or six weeks—” "
"“娶她吗，哈里？”","“To marry her, Harry?”"
"“杰克，你都不知道你在说什么！”","“Jack, you don’t know what you are talking about!”"
"“噢，很可能是这样，但是我很清楚我将要做什么。”","“Ah, that’s very likely; but I know quite well what I shall do.”"
"“你要做什么？”","“What will you do?”"
"“我要娶她，如果你不娶她的话，所以你得抓紧了。”杰克笑道，“愿圣芒戈保佑！我对美丽的内尔极为着迷！一个像她那样在煤矿中长大的年轻貌美的人，非常适合做一个矿工的妻子。她是一个孤儿——我也是；如果你不喜欢她，如果她愿意和我——”","“Marry her myself, if you don’t; so look sharp,” laughed Jack,“By Saint Mungo!I think an immense deal of bonny Nell!A fine young creature like that, who has been brought up in the mine, is just the very wife for a miner.She is an orphan—so am I; and if you don't care much for her, and if she will have me—”"
"哈里严肃地看着杰克，没有试图打断他，任他继续说着。“难道你没开始感到嫉妒吗，哈里？”杰克以一种更严肃的口吻问道。","Harry looked gravely at Jack, and let him talk on without trying to stop him.“Don’t you begin to feel jealous, Harry?” asked Jack in a more serious tone."
"“一点儿也没有。”哈里平静地回答道。","“Not at all.” answered Harry quietly."
"“但如果你不娶内尔，你肯定不想她做一个老姑娘吧？”","“But if you don’t marry Nell yourself, you surely can’t expect her to remain a spinster?”"
"“我什么也不想。”哈里说。","“I expect nothing.” said Harry."
"这时，梯子的一次运转给了这两个朋友机会——一个向上，另一个下到井里。然而，他们仍留在原地。","A movement of the ladder machinery now gave the two friends the opportunity—one to go up, the other down the shaft.However, they remained where they were."
"“哈里，”杰克说道，“你认为我刚才说的关于内尔的话是认真的吗？”","“Harry,” quoth Jack, “do you think I spoke in earnest just now about Nell?”"
"“不，我认为不是的，杰克。”","“No, that I don’t, Jack.”"
"“好吧，但现在我要认真了！”","“Well, but now I will!”"
"“你？认真地说？”","“You? speak in earnest?”"
"“我的好伙伴，我可以告诉你，我很擅长给朋友提一点儿建议。”","“My good fellow, I can tell you I am quite capable of giving a friend a bit of advice.”"
"“那我听着，杰克！”","“Let’s hear, then, Jack!”"
"“好，听我说！你真心地爱着内尔，内尔也值得你爱。你的父亲老西蒙和母亲老马奇都很喜欢她，对她视如己出。你为什么不让她真的这样呢？你为什么不娶她呢？”","“Well, look here!You love Nell as heartily as she deserves.Old Simon, your father, and old Madge, your mother, both love her as if she were their daughter.Why don’t you make her so in reality?Why don’t you marry her?”"
"“好了，杰克，”哈里说道，“你一直围绕着这个话题，好像你知道内尔对这件事的看法一样。”","“Come, Jack,” said Harry, “you are running on as if you knew how Nell felt on the subject.”"
"“每个人都知道，”杰克回答道，“因此，想让你嫉妒我们中的任何一个人都是不可能的。不过梯子又来了——我要下去了！”","“Everybody knows that,” replied Jack, “and therefore it is impossible to make you jealous of any of us.But here goes the ladder again—I’m off!”"
"“等一会儿，杰克！”哈里叫道，想留住正踏上移动阶梯的同伴。","“Stop a minute, Jack!” cried Harry, detaining his companion, who was stepping onto the moving staircase."
"“喂！你似乎打算让我在这儿待几刻钟！”","“I say! you seem to mean me to take up my quarters here altogether!”"
"“认真听着，杰克！现在我要认真地说了。”","“Do be serious and listen, Jack!I want to speak in earnest myself now.”"
"“好，我听着，等梯子再次运转时，我一分钟都不会再等。”","“Well, I’ll listen till the ladder moves again, not a minute longer.”"
"“杰克，”哈里继续说道，“我没有必要假装我不爱内尔，我最大的愿望就是她能做我的妻子。”","“Jack,” resumed Harry, “I need not pretend that I do not love Nell; I wish above all things to make her my wife.”"
"“那很好！”","“That’s all right!”"
"“但是现在要求她对我许下一个不可改变的承诺，我良心上有顾虑。”","“But for the present I have scruples of conscience as to asking her to make me a promise which would be irrevocable.”"
"“你是什么意思，哈里？”","“What can you mean, Harry?”"
"“我的意思是——可以肯定，内尔从未出过煤矿，她出生在煤矿深处，并且有理由推断，她对煤矿之外的事物既不知道也不了解。她的眼睛——是的，也许还有她的内心——还要学每样东西。当全新的印象在她脑中形成时，谁能知道她会想些什么？由于她对这个世界尚不了解，如果我让她在毫不知情的情况下做决定，选择一辈子呆在煤矿里，这对我而言与欺骗无异。你明白我的意思吗，杰克？”","“I mean just this—that, it being certain Nell has never been outside this coal mine in the very depths of which she was born, it stands to reason that she knows nothing, and can comprehend nothing of what exists beyond it.Her eyes—yes, and perhaps also her heart—have everything yet to learn.Who can tell what her thoughts will be, when perfectly new impressions shall be made upon her mind?As yet she knows nothing of the world, and to me it would seem like deceiving her, if I led her to decide in ignorance, upon choosing to remain all her life in the coal mine.Do you understand me, Jack?”"
"“嗨！——是的——非常明白。我最明白的是，你要让我错过梯子的又一次运转了。”","“Hem!—yes—pretty well.What I understand best is that you are going to make me miss another turn of the ladder.”"
"“杰克，”哈里严肃地说道，“即使这个机器完全停止，即使这个着陆处在我们脚下坍塌，你都必须而且应该听听我要说的话。”","“Jack,” replied Harry gravely, “if this machinery were to stop altogether, if this landing-place were to fall beneath our feet, you must and shall hear what I have to say.”"
"“说得好，哈里！我就是喜欢你这样对我说话！那就这么定了，在你娶内尔之前，她应该去奥尔德·里基学校学习。”","“Well done, Harry!That’s how I like to be spoken to!Let’s settle, then, that, before you marry Nell, she shall go to school in Auld Reekie.”"
"“真的没必要，杰克，我自己完全能教育这个将成为我妻子的人。”","“No indeed, Jack; I am perfectly able myself to educate the person who is to be my wife.”"
"“那样当然更好，哈里！”","“Sure that will be a great deal better, Harry!”"
"“但是，首先，”哈里继续说道，“我希望内尔能够对外面的世界有一个真正的认识。为了说明我的意思，杰克，假设你和一个失明的女孩相爱了，但是有人告诉你，‘一个月之后她的视力将会恢复，’难道你不会等到她被治愈后再和她结婚吗？”","“But, first of all,” resumed Harry, “I wish that Nell should gain a real knowledge of the upper world.To illustrate my meaning, Jack, suppose you were in love with a blind girl, and someone said to you, ‘In a month’s time her sight will be restored,’ would you not wait till after she was cured, to marry her?”"
"“会的，我肯定会的！”杰克大声说道。","“Faith, to be sure I would!” exclaimed Jack."
"“那么，杰克，内尔现在还看不见，在她嫁给我之前，我希望她了解我，了解她将要面临的真实生活。总之，她必须看见有日光的物体！”","“Well, Jack, Nell is at present blind; and before she marries me, I wish her to see what I am, and what the life really is to which she would bind herself.In short, she must have daylight let in upon the subject!”"
"“说得好，哈里！说得真好！”杰克叫道，“现在我明白你的用意了。那我们所期望的行动什么时候可以开始呢？”","“Well said, Harry!Very well said indeed!” cried Jack.“Now I see what you are driving at.And when may we expect the operation to come off?”"
"“一个月之后，杰克，”哈里回答道，“内尔正在适应我们反光镜的光亮。那是一种准备工作。一个月之后，我希望她能看见大地和大地上的奇观——天空和它的壮丽景色。她会理解宇宙是无边无际的。”","“In a month, Jack,” replied Harry.“Nell is getting used to the light of our reflectors.That is some preparation.In a month she will, I hope, have seen the earth and its wonders—the sky and its splendors.She will perceive that the limits of the universe are boundless.”"
"但是正当哈里发挥他的想象力时，杰克·瑞安已经离开了平台，跳到了运转机器的阶梯上。","But while Harry was thus giving the rein to his imagination, Jack Ryan, quitting the platform, had leaped on the step of the moving machinery."
"“喂，杰克！你在哪里？”","“Hullo, Jack!Where are you?”"
"“在离你很远的下面，”这个快乐的小伙子笑道，“在你向上猛升的时候，我已经降到下面来了。”","“Far beneath you,” laughed the merry fellow.“While you soar to the heights, I plunge into the depths.”"
"“再见了，杰克！”哈里自己也抓着上升的梯子，回应道，“记住别提起我刚刚对你讲的话。”","“Fare ye well. Jack!” returned Harry, himself laying hold of the rising ladder; “mind you say nothing about what I have been telling you.”"
"“一个字也不会，”杰克喊道，“但是我有一个条件。”","“Not a word,” shouted Jack, “but I make one condition.”"
"“什么条件？”","“What is that?”"
"“那就是，当内尔开始她的第一次地面短途旅行时，我可以加入你们！”","“That I may be one of the party when Nell’s first excursion to the face of the earth comes off!”"
"“你会的，杰克，我向你保证！”","“So you shall, Jack, I promise you!”"
"机器的又一次震动把这两个朋友间的距离拉得更远。他们的声音在彼此听来都模糊不清了。然而，哈里仍能听见杰克在喊叫。","A fresh throb of the machinery placed a yet more considerable distance between the friends.Their voices sounded faintly to each other.Harry, however, could still hear Jack shouting:"
"“喂！与内尔看过的太阳、月亮和星星相比，你知道她更喜欢什么吗？”","“I say! do you know what Nell will like better than either sun, moon, or stars, after she’s seen the whole of them?”"
"“不知道，杰克！”","“No, Jack!”"
"“嗨，就是你，老朋友！还是你！总是你！”杰克的声音消逝在一声长长的“哇”中。","“Why, you yourself, old fellow! still you! always you!”And Jack’s voice died away in a prolonged “Hurrah!”"
"从那以后，哈里利用他所有的空余时间孜孜不倦地教导内尔。他教她读书写字，她进步很快，可以说她有学习的天赋。敏捷的才智从未如此快地战胜彻底的无知。对她身边人而言这是一种奇迹。","Harry, after this, applied himself diligently, during all his spare time, to the work of Nell’s education.He taught her to read and to write, and such rapid progress did she make, it might have been said that she learnt by instinct.Never did keen intelligence more quickly triumph over utter ignorance.It was the wonder of all beholders."
"西蒙和马奇一天比一天更喜欢他们收养的孩子，但她从前的生活仍令他们很疑惑。他们清楚地知道哈里对她的感情，但完全没有因此而不高兴。他们还记得，在工程师第一次拜访这个旧村舍时西蒙对他说过,“我们的儿子怎么会想到结婚呢？在哪里可以为一个必须在煤矿深处度过一生的小伙子找到一个合适的妻子呢？”","Simon and Madge became every day more and more attached to their adopted child, whose former history continued to puzzle them a good deal.They plainly saw the nature of Harry’s feelings towards her, and were far from displeased thereat.They recollected that Simon had said to the engineer on his first visit to the old cottage, “How can our son ever think of marrying?Where could a wife possibly be found suitable for a lad whose whole life must be passed in the depths of a coal mine?”"
"这下好了！现在似乎上苍已经将这个世界上最理想的伴侣送给他了。这不就像是直接来自于上帝的恩赐吗？因此，老工头下定决心，如果要举行婚礼，新阿伯福伊尔的矿工们将在煤城尽情玩乐，这会成为他们终生难忘的一件事。西蒙·福特不知道自己在说什么！","Well! now it seemed as if the most desirable companion in the world had been led to him by Providence.Was not this like a blessing direct from Heaven?So the old man made up his mind that, if the wedding did take place, the miners of New Aberfoyle should have a merry-making at Coal Town, which they would never during their lives forget.Simon Ford little knew what he was saying!"
"必须说一下，另一个人和西蒙一样期望着哈里和内尔的结合——那个人就是工程师詹姆斯·斯塔尔。当然，他是真的关心这两个年轻人的幸福。但是，促使他这样期望的还有另一个涉及到更广泛利益的动机。","It must be remarked that another person wished for this union of Harry and Nell as much as Simon did—and that was James Starr, the engineer.Of course he was really interested in the happiness of the two young people.But another motive, connected with wider interests, influenced him to desire it."
"大家知道詹姆斯·斯塔尔仍然心存一些忧虑，尽管现在没有任何事情发生来证明这点。然而，那些事情可能会再次发生。关于这个新路堑的秘密——内尔显然是唯一的知情人。现在，如果对阿伯福伊尔矿工们的新威胁正在酝酿中，而他们又不知道其中的原因，那他们怎么可能防范呢？","It has been said that James Starr continued to entertain a certain amount of apprehension, although for the present nothing appeared to justify it.Yet that which had been might again be.This mystery about the new cutting—Nell was evidently the only person acquainted with it.Now, if fresh dangers were in store for the miners of Aberfoyle, how were they possibly to be guarded against, without so much as knowing the cause of them?"
"“内尔仍保持沉默，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔经常说道，“但她对其他人隐瞒的事情不会对她的丈夫隐瞒很久。任何针对我们大家的危险，也是针对哈里的危险。因此，一桩能给相爱的人带来幸福、给他们的朋友带来安全的婚姻，将是一桩美满的婚姻，要是这井下真有这事的话。”","“Nell has persisted in keeping silence,” said James Starr very often, “but what she has concealed from others, she will not long hide from her husband.Any danger would be danger to Harry as well as to the rest of us.Therefore, a marriage which brings happiness to the lovers, and safety to their friends, will be a good marriage, if ever there is such a thing here below.”"
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔这样推理也并非毫无逻辑。他将自己的想法告诉了老西蒙，显然老西蒙赞同他的想法。那么现在，似乎没什么会阻碍哈里和内尔的婚姻了。事实上，有什么会阻止这件事呢？他们彼此相爱，而且父母觉得这对他们的儿子而言再好不过了。哈里的伙伴们嫉妒他的幸运，但他们心甘情愿地承认这是他应得的。这位少女不用听从任何人的意见，只需她自己心里同意就行。","Thus, not illogically, reasoned James Starr.He communicated his ideas to old Simon, who decidedly appreciated them.Nothing, then, appeared to stand in the way of the match.What, in fact, was there to prevent it?They loved each other; the parents desired nothing better for their son.Harry’s comrades envied his good fortune, but freely acknowledged that he deserved it.The maiden depended on no one else, and had but to give the consent of her own heart."
"那为什么，如果没有人阻止这桩婚姻——为什么，当夜晚来临时，一天的工作结束了，煤矿里的电灯熄灭了，煤城的居民在他们的住所里休息了——为什么有一个神秘的人影总是从新阿伯福伊尔的阴暗角落里出现，无声地在黑暗中游走呢？","Why, then, if there were none to place obstacles in the way of this union—why, as night came on, and, the labors of the day being over, the electric lights in the mine were extinguished, and all the inhabitants of Coal Town at rest within their dwellings—why did a mysterious form always emerge from the gloomier recesses of New Aberfoyle, and silently glide through the darkness?"
"是什么直觉指引着这个幽灵轻松地穿行于狭窄到看似不能行走的通道上呢？","What instinct guided this phantom with ease through passages so narrow as to appear to be impracticable?"
"为什么这个奇怪的生灵，眼睛在幽深的黑暗中闪烁着，会沿着马尔科姆湖湖岸谨慎地爬行？为什么他会直接奔向西蒙的村舍，并迄今为止都谨慎地躲过了所有人的注意？为什么他会俯向窗户，努力地想听清紧闭窗内的某些对话片段？","Why should the strange being, with eyes flashing through the deepest darkness, come cautiously creeping along the shores of Lake Malcolm?Why so directly make his way towards Simon’s cottage, yet so carefully as hitherto to avoid notice?Why, bending towards the windows, did he strive to catch, by listening, some fragment of the conversation within the closed shutters?"
"而且，当他听到一些话时，为什么他会以威胁的手势地朝那个平静的住所挥动拳头，并从他的齿间咕哝出这些愤怒的话：“她和他？休想！休想！”","And, on catching a few words, why did he shake his fist with a menacing gesture towards the calm abode, while from between his set teeth issued these words in muttered fury, “She and he?Never! never!”"
"第十四章　日出","CHAPTER XIV A SUNRISE"
"一个月后，在八月二十日的晚上，西蒙·福特和马奇与四个即将从村舍出发去旅行的人道别，并致以他们美好的祝愿。","A month after this, on the evening of the 20th of August, Simon Ford and Madge took leave, with all manner of good wishes, of four tourists, who were setting forth from the cottage."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔、哈里以及杰克·瑞安将要带内尔踏上她从未涉足过的路面，带她去领略光亮下美妙的大自然，那是她还未见过的。这次短途旅行将持续两天。詹姆斯·斯塔尔和哈里都希望这四十八小时的地面经历，能让这位少女看见她在黑暗矿井里一无所知的事物；地球各种各样的景象，城镇、平原、高山、河流、湖泊、海湾和大海，像一幅全景画卷一一展现在她眼前。","James Starr, Harry, and Jack Ryan were about to lead Nell’s steps over yet untrodden paths, and to show her the glories of nature by a light to which she was as yet a stranger.The excursion was to last for two days.James Starr, as well as Harry, considered that during these eight and forty hours spent above ground, the maiden would be able to see everything of which she must have remained ignorant in the gloomy pit; all the varied aspects of the globe, towns, plains, mountains, rivers, lakes, gulfs, and seas would pass, panorama-like, before her eyes."
"在位于爱丁堡和格拉斯哥之间的苏格兰这部分土地上，大自然似乎汇集并展示了陆地上所有的典型美景。至于天空，它们遍布于整个地球，有着变化多端的云朵、或宁静或模糊的月亮、光芒四射的太阳以及成团成簇的星星。这次旅行的目的是为观赏所有这些景象。","In that part of Scotland lying between Edinburgh and Glasgow, Nature would seem to have collected and set forth specimens of every one of these terrestrial beauties.As to the heavens, they would be spread abroad as over the whole earth, with their changeful clouds, serene or veiled moon, their radiant sun, and clustering stars.The expedition had been planned so as to combine a view of all these things."
"西蒙和马奇应该会很高兴和内尔一同前往，但是他们从不愿意离开他们的村舍，下不了决心离开他们的地下家园，哪怕仅一天。","Simon and Madge would have been glad to go with Nell; but they never left their cottage willingly, and could not makeup their minds to quit their subterranean home for a single day."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔是以一个观察者和哲学家的身份前去的，他急于从心理学的角度关注发生在内尔身上的新印象，可能他还希望发现关于内尔童年神秘事件的线索。哈里带着些许不安问自己，这么快接触外面的世界是否可能会将这个他已了解并深爱的少女变成另外一个完全不同的女孩。至于杰克·瑞安，他快乐得就像一只在第一缕阳光中飞起的百灵鸟。他只相信他的快乐具有感染力，会使他的旅行同伴们更有活力，这是对他们让他同行的回报。内尔沉思着一言不发。","James Starr went as an observer and philosopher, curious to note, from a psychological point of view, the novel impressions made upon Nell; perhaps also with some hope of detecting a clue to the mysterious events connected with her childhood.Harry, with a little trepidation, asked himself whether it was not possible that this rapid initiation into the things of the exterior world would change the maiden he had known and loved hitherto into quite a different girl.As for Jack Ryan, he was as joyous as a lark rising in the first beams of the sun.He only trusted that his gayety would prove contagious, and enliven his traveling companions, thus rewarding them for letting him join them.Nell was pensive and silent."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔非常理智地决定在傍晚出发。慢慢从夜晚的黑暗进入到大白天的光亮，对这个女孩而言会好很多。从晚上出发可以做到这一点，因为在午夜与正午之间她将体验到光与影的交替过程，这是她的视觉不得不习惯的。","James Starr had decided, very sensibly, to set off in the evening.It would be very much better for the girl to pass gradually from the darkness of night to the full light of day; and that would in this way be managed, since between midnight and noon she would experience the successive phases of shade and sunshine, to which her sight had to get accustomed."
"正当他们要离开村舍时，内尔抓住哈里的手问道：“哈里，我真的有必要离开这个煤矿吗，哪怕只有这几天？”","Just as they left the cottage, Nell took Harry’s hand saying,“Harry, is it really necessary for me to leave the mine at all, even for these few days?”"
"“是的，有必要，内尔，”年轻人回答道，“它对我们俩都是有必要的。”","“Yes, it is, Nell,” replied the young man.“It is needful for both of us.”"
"“但是，哈里，”内尔接着问道，“自从你发现我以来，我已经非常快乐了。你一直在教我。为什么这还不够呢？我到上面去干什么呢？”","“But, Harry,” resumed Nell, “ever since you found me, I have been as happy as I can possibly be.You have been teaching me.Why is that not enough?What am I going up there for?”"
"哈里默默地看着内尔。内尔几乎说出了自己的想法。","Harry looked at her in silence.Nell was giving utterance to nearly his own thoughts."
"“我的孩子，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，“我完全能理解你的犹豫，但是你和我们一起去对你会有好处的。那些爱你的人带你去，也会带你回来。之后，如果你愿意，你可以自由地选择继续生活在煤矿里，就像老西蒙、马奇和哈里那样。但至少你应该能够把你所选择的事情与你所放弃的事情进行对比，然后自由决定。走吧！”","“My child,” said James Starr, “I can well understand the hesitation you feel; but it will be good for you to go with us.Those who love you are taking you, and they will bring you back again.Afterwards you will be free, if you wish it, to continue your life in the coal mine, like old Simon, and Madge, and Harry.But at least you ought to be able to compare what you give up with what you choose, then decide freely.Come!”"
"“走吧，亲爱的内尔！”哈里大声喊道。","“Come, dear Nell!” cried Harry."
"“哈里，我愿意跟你一起去。”少女回答道。九点钟，穿过隧道的最后一班火车启动，将内尔和她的同伴们送到地面上。二十分钟后，他们在站台下车了，通往新阿伯福伊尔的铁路支线与从邓巴顿到斯特林郡的铁路在这里汇合。","“Harry, I am willing to follow you,” replied the maiden.At nine o’clock the last train through the tunnel started to convey Nell and her companions to the surface of the earth.Twenty minutes later they alighted on the platform where the branch line to New Aberfoyle joins the railway from Dumbarton to Stirling."
"天已经黑了。从地平线到天顶，富含蒸汽的轻轻的云朵被一阵西北方的凉爽微风吹动着，迅速飘向高空。白天迷人，夜晚应该同样迷人。","The night was already dark.From the horizon to the zenith, light vapory clouds hurried through the upper air, driven by a refreshing northwesterly breeze.The day had been lovely; the night promised to be so likewise."
"一到斯特林郡，内尔和她的朋友们就下了火车，立即离开了车站。在前面的大树之间，他们可以看见一条通往福斯河岸的路。","On reaching Stirling, Nell and her friends, quitting the train, left the station immediately.Just before them, between high trees, they could see a road which led to the banks of the river Forth."
"这个女孩的第一个身体感受就是她的肺部急切地吸进纯净的空气。","The first physical impression on the girl was the purity of the air inhaled eagerly by her lungs."
"“自由地呼吸吧，内尔，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“空气中弥漫着空旷地带所有的芬芳气息。”","“Breathe it freely, Nell,” said James Starr; “it is fragrant with all the scents of the open country.”"
"“从我们头顶上飘过的烟是什么？”内尔询问道。","“What is all that smoke passing over our heads?” inquired Nell."
"“那些是云，”哈里回答道，“是被一阵西风吹动的。”","“Those are clouds,” answered Harry, “blown along by the westerly wind.”"
"“噢！”内尔说道，“我多么希望自己也被带进那平静的旋涡中啊！那些在云缝间四处闪烁的发光亮点是什么呢？”","“Ah!” said Nell, “how I should like to feel myself carried along in that silent whirl!And what are those shining sparks which glance here and there between rents in the clouds?”"
"“那些就是我跟你说过的星星，内尔。有多少个太阳，就可能有多少个像我们这样的世界中心。”","“Those are the stars I have told you about, Nell.So many suns they are, so many centers of worlds like our own, most likely.”"
"当风吹走了深蓝天空中的云朵后，那些星群变得愈发清晰可见。内尔盯着头顶上空无数闪闪发光的星星。“但为什么，”最后她问道，“如果这些是太阳，我的眼睛能够忍受它们的光亮？”","The constellations became more clearly visible as the wind cleared the clouds from the deep blue of the firmament.Nell gazed upon the myriad stars which sparkled overhead.“But how is it,” she said at length, “that if these are suns, my eyes can endure their brightness?”"
"“我的孩子，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道，“它们的确是太阳，却位于极其遥远的地方。在这些数不清的星星中，离我们最近的一颗是织女星，它的光线能照射到我们身上，你可以在天琴座的天顶附近看见它，它距离我们有五百亿里格。因此，它的光亮不会影响你的视力。但是明天将升起的我们星球的太阳，仅距离我们三千八百万里格，肉眼不能盯着它看，因为它比任何熔炉里的火焰还要亮。但是来吧，内尔，来吧！”","“My child,” replied James Starr, “they are indeed suns, but sun sat an enormous distance.The nearest of these millions of stars, whose rays can reach us, is Vega, that star in Lyra which you observe near the zenith, and that is fifty thousand millions of leagues distant.Its brightness, therefore, cannot affect your vision.But our own sun, which will rise to-morrow, is only distant thirty-eight millions of leagues, and no human eye can gaze fixedly upon that, for it is brighter than the blaze of any furnace.But come, Nell, come!”"
"他们继续上路了，詹姆斯·斯塔尔走在内尔前面，哈里走在她旁边，而杰克·瑞安则像一条小狗一样来回走动，对它主人们的慢步伐有点不耐烦。路上没有人。内尔一直在看那些大树，它们的树枝在风中摇曳着，在她看来它们就像是巨人们在用力打手势。微风拂过树梢时的声音、无风时的一片沉寂、路穿过开阔的平地时依稀可见的远处地平线——所有这些事物带给她新的感受，并在她的脑海里留下永恒的印象。","They pursued their way, James Starr leading the maiden, Harry walking by her side, while Jack Ryan roamed about like a young dog, impatient of the slow pace of his masters.The road was lonely.Nell kept looking at the great trees, whose branches, waving in the wind, made them seem to her like giants gesticulating wildly.The sound of the breeze in the tree-tops, the deep silence during a lull, the distant line of the horizon, which could be discerned when the road passed over open levels—all these things filled her with new sensations, and left lasting impressions on her mind."
"不久之后内尔停止了提问，她的同伴们尊重她的沉默，他们不愿任何言语影响到这位少女极为敏锐的想象力，而是更希望这些概念在她的心灵里自发地生成。","After some time she ceased to ask questions, and her companions respected her silence, not wishing to influence by any words of theirs the girl’s highly sensitive imagination, but preferring to allow ideas to arise spontaneously in her soul."
"大约十一点半，他们到达了福斯河岸。在那里，有一艘詹姆斯·斯塔尔租的船等候着他们。几小时后，这艘船就可以将他们送到格兰顿了。每当反射星光的波浪与河岸轻轻撞击时，内尔便会看到清澈的河水涌至她脚底。“这是一个湖吗？”内尔说。","At about half past eleven o’clock, they gained the banks of the river Forth.There a boat, chartered by James Starr, awaited them.In a few hours it would convey them all to Granton.Nell looked at the clear water which flowed up to her feet, as the waves broke gently on the beach, reflecting the starlight.“Is this a lake?” said she."
"“不，”哈里回答道，“这是一条流向大海的大河，很快它就会变得很宽，就像一个海湾。用手捧点水尝尝，内尔，你会发现它没有马尔科姆湖的水甜。”","“No,” replied Harry, “it is a great river flowing towards the sea, and soon opening so widely as to resemble a gulf.Taste a little of the water in the hollow of your hand, Nell, and you will perceive that it is not sweet like the waters of Lake Malcolm.”"
"这个少女俯向河流，捧了一点水放到唇边，“很咸。”她说道。","The maiden bent towards the stream, and, raising a little water to her lips, “This is quite salt,” said she."
"“是的，因为是涨潮期，海水回流到了河水这里。”哈里回答道。","“Yes, the tide is full; the sea water flows up the river as far as this,” answered Harry."
"“啊，哈里！哈里！”这位少女激动地大声叫道，“地平线上那团红光是什么？是森林着火了吗？”","“Oh, Harry!Harry!” exclaimed the maiden, “what can that red glow on the horizon be?Is it a forest on fire?”"
"“不，内尔，那是正在升起的月亮。”","“No, it is the rising moon, Nell.”"
"“是的，那是月亮，”杰克·瑞安大声说道，“一面精致硕大的银盘，天上的精灵们操纵着它在空中到处行走，像收钱一样将星星收入囊中。”","“To be sure, that’s the moon,” cried Jack Ryan, “a fine big silver plate, which the spirits of air hand round and round the sky to collect the stars in, like money.”"
"“嗨，杰克，”工程师笑着说道，“想不到你竟能想出这么大胆的比喻！”","“Why, Jack,” said the engineer, laughing, “I had no idea you could strike out such bold comparisons!”"
"“嗯，斯塔尔先生，但它只是一个比喻而已。难道您没有看见月亮所到之处星星就消失了吗？所以我猜星星全掉到月亮里去了。”","“Well, but, Mr. Starr, it is a just comparison.Don't you see the stars disappear as the moon passes on? so I suppose they drop into it.”"
"“你想说的，杰克，就是月亮凭借它六等星亮度的光亮遮盖了星星的光亮，所以月亮一靠近星星，它们就全消失了。”","“What you mean to say, Jack, is that the superior brilliancy of the moon eclipses that of stars of the sixth magnitude, therefore they vanish as she approaches.”"
"“这一切好美啊！”内尔一遍一遍地重复道，从她的眼里可以看出她内心的全部想法。“我原以为月亮是圆的呢？”","“How beautiful all this is!” repeated Nell again and again, with her whole soul in her eyes.“But I thought the moon was round?”"
"“当它是‘满月’时，它是圆的，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“就是当月亮和太阳正对着时。但是今晚月亮被遮住了一部分，只剩最后的四分之一，杰克朋友的大银盘看起来更像是一个理发师的盆子。”","“So she is, when ‘full,’” said James Starr; “that means when she is just opposite to the sun.But to-night the moon is in the last quarter, shorn of her just proportions, and friend Jack’s grand silver plate looks more like a barber’s basin.”"
"“噢，斯塔尔先生，您的比喻太不恰当了！”他叫道，“我正要给月亮作一首十四行诗，但是您那理发师的盆子破坏了我所有的灵感。”","“Oh, Mr. Starr, what a base comparison!” he exclaimed, “I was just going to begin a sonnet to the moon, but your barber’s basin has destroyed all chance of an inspiration.”"
"慢慢地，月亮升到空中了。在月光下，浮游的云朵消失了，而西边未受其光芒影响的星星仍闪烁着。内尔静静地盯着这壮丽的景色。柔和的银光让内尔的眼睛感觉很舒适，她那被哈里握着的手微微颤抖着，表明她已被这景色深深地震撼。","Gradually the moon ascended the heavens.Before her light the lingering clouds fled away, while stars still sparkled in the west, beyond the influence of her radiance.Nell gazed in silence on the glorious spectacle.The soft silvery light was pleasant to her eyes, and her little trembling hand expressed to Harry, who clasped it, how deeply she was affected by the scene."
"“我们上船吧，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“我们必须在日出之前到达阿瑟王宝座山的顶端。”","“Let us embark now,” said James Starr.“We have to get to the top of Arthur’s Seat before sunrise.”"
"岸边的一个桩上系着一条船。一个船夫等候着他们。内尔和她的朋友们坐下来，帆拉开了，很快它就被微微的西北风吹鼓起来，他们一路上加速前进。","The boat was moored to a post on the bank.A boatman awaited them.Nell and her friends took their seats; the sail was spread; it quickly filled before the northwesterly breeze, and they sped on their way."
"对这个少女来说，这是多么全新的感受啊！她以前在马尔科姆湖上划过船，现在被哈里轻轻摇动的浆那时在划桨者手里却总是使不动。现在，内尔第一次感到她被一种滑行运动牵引着，就像气球在空中滑行一样。这里的水和湖水一样平静，内尔斜躺在船尾，享受着轻柔的晃荡。偶尔，月光照在水面上，船就像行驶在一片银光闪闪的水域上。微波沿着河岸泛开涟漪。这太迷人了。","What a new sensation was this for the maiden!She had been rowed on the waters of Lake Malcolm; but the oar, handled ever so lightly by Harry, always betrayed effort on the part of the oarsman.Now, for the first time, Nell felt herself borne along with a gliding movement, like that of a balloon through the air.The water was smooth as a lake, and Nell reclined in the stern of the boat, enjoying its gentle rocking.Occasionally the effect of the moonlight on the waters was as though the boat sailed across a glittering silver field.Little wavelets rippled along the banks.It was enchanting."
"最后内尔深感睡意，她的眼皮垂下来，头枕在哈里的肩上——她睡了。哈里本想叫醒她，觉得她若错过这壮观夜色的任何美景都会很遗憾。","At length Nell was overcome with drowsiness, her eyelids drooped, her head sank on Harry’s shoulder—she slept.Harry, sorry that she should miss any of the beauties of this magnificent night, would have aroused her."
"“让她睡吧！”工程师说道，“休息几小时后，她能更好地欣赏白天的新鲜事物。”","“Let her sleep!” said the engineer.“She will better enjoy the novelties of the day after a couple of hours’ rest.”"
"凌晨两点，船抵达格兰顿码头。内尔醒了。“我刚睡着了？”她问道。","At two o’clock in the morning the boat reached Granton pier.Nell awoke.“Have I been asleep?” inquired she."
"“没有，孩子，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“你只是想象着你睡了，仅此而已。”","“No, my child,” said James Starr.“You have been dreaming that you slept, that’s all.”"
"夜色依然明亮。半空中的月亮将光芒洒向四面八方。格兰顿小港停泊着两三只渔船，它们在峡湾水域上轻轻地摇晃着。即将破晓时风停了。空气中已没有了雾气，预示着八月份的美好时光即将来临。在海岸边，八月的时光是如此令人愉快。","The night continued clear.The moon, riding in mid-heaven, diffused her rays on all sides.In the little port of Granton lay two or three fishing boats; they rocked gently on the waters of the Firth.The wind fell as the dawn approached.The atmosphere, clear of mists, promised one of those fine autumn days so delicious on the sea coast."
"地平线上有一股薄薄的透明水汽，第一缕阳光会将它驱散。对这个少女来说，这里呈现的海景似乎与天空融合在一起了。现在她的视野开阔了，没有认为海洋是无边无际的。","A soft, transparent film of vapor lay along the horizon; the first sunbeam would dissipate it; to the maiden it exhibited that aspect of the sea which seems to blend it with the sky.Her view was now enlarged, without producing the impression of the boundless infinity of ocean."
"哈里握着内尔的手，他们一行人跟着詹姆斯·斯塔尔和杰克·瑞安穿过无人的街道。对内尔来说，这个首府的郊区似乎不过是一片黑压压的房子，就像煤城一样，只不过这儿的房顶更高些，闪烁着点点光亮。","Harry taking Nell’s hand, they followed James Starr and Jack Ryan as they traversed the deserted streets.To Nell, this suburb of the capital appeared only a collection of gloomy dark houses, just like Coal Town, only that the roof was higher, and gleamed with small lights."
"她轻盈地向前走着，毫不费力地和哈里保持着相同的速度。“你不累吗，内尔？”走了半小时后，他问道。","She stepped lightly forward, and easily kept pace with Harry.“Are you not tired, Nell?” asked he, after half an hour’s walking."
"“不累！我的脚似乎都没碰到地面，”她回答道，“我们上方的天空看上去真高，我感觉好像我长着翅膀可以飞翔了！”","“No! my feet seem scarcely to touch the earth,” returned she.“This sky above us seems so high up, I feel as if I could take wing and fly!”"
"“喂！抓紧她！”杰克·瑞安叫道，“我们的小内尔太好了，不能弄丢的。当我很久没出矿井时，我的感觉和你刚刚描述的一样。”","“I say! keep hold of her!” cried Jack Ryan.“Our little Nell is too good to lose.I feel just as you describe though, myself, when I have not left the pit for a long time.”"
"“当我们不再有煤城拱形的岩石屋顶给我们带来的压抑感时，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“宽阔的天空对我们来说就像一个巨大的深渊，可以说，我们会有一种想冲进去的欲望。你的感觉是这样的吗，内尔？”","“It is when we no longer experience the oppressive effect of the vaulted rocky roof above Coal Town,” said James Starr, “that the spacious firmament appears to us like a profound abyss into which we have, as it were, a desire to plunge.Is that what you feel, Nell?”"
"“是这样的，斯塔尔先生，一模一样，”内尔说道，“它让我感到晕眩。”","“Yes, Mr. Starr, it is exactly like that,” said Nell.“It makes me feel giddy.”"
"“噢！你很快就会适应的，内尔。”哈里说道，“你会习惯外面的世界，而且很可能你会完全忘记那个黑暗的矿井。”","“Ah! You will soon get over that, Nell,” said Harry.“You will get used to the outer world, and most likely forget all about our dark coal pit.”"
"“不，哈里，永远不会的！”内尔说道，这时她手捂双眼，就像在回忆她最近忘记的所有事物。","“No, Harry, never!” said Nell, and she put her hand over her eyes, as though she would recall the remembrance of everything she had lately quitted."
"在城市宁静的房屋间，这一行人穿过了利斯步行街，绕过了卡尔顿山；在黎明时昏暗的光线下，天文台和纳尔逊纪念碑矗立在那里。他们经过了里真特桥和北桥，最后到达了坎农格特的南部。城镇仍在沉睡中。","Between the silent dwellings of the city, the party passed along Leith Walk, and went round the Calton Hill, where stood, in the light of the gray dawn, the buildings of the Observatory and Nelson’s Monument.By Regent’s Bridge and the North Bridge they at last reached the lower extremity of the Canongate.The town still lay wrapt in slumber."
"内尔指着露天空旷处中间的一座大建筑物问道：“那一大块模糊的是什么啊？”","Nell pointed to a large building in the center of an open space, asking,“What great confused mass is that?”"
"“那模糊的一块，内尔，是古代苏格兰国王的宫殿，即霍利鲁德宫，在那里曾发生过很多悲惨的事情！在这里，历史学家可以想起许多王室成员的影子，从早期的苏格兰国王到不幸的玛丽·斯图亚特和法国国王查理十世。可是，内尔，天亮后宫殿看起来就不会这么暗淡了。霍利鲁德宫和它那四个防御塔楼，就像是某个漂亮的村屋。那我们继续前进吧。霍利鲁德宫的古老修道院上方是非常壮观的悬崖，叫做索尔兹伯里峭壁。阿瑟王宝座山位于它们上方，那就是我们要去的地方。从阿瑟王宝座山顶端往下看，内尔，你将看到太阳从海平面上升起来。”","“That confused mass, Nell, is the palace of the ancient kings of Scotland; that is Holyrood, where many a sad scene has been enacted!The historian can here invoke many a royal shade; from those of the early Scottish kings to that of the unhappy Mary Stuart, and the French king, Charles X.When day breaks, however, Nell, this palace will not look so very gloomy.Holyrood, with its four embattled towers, is not unlike some handsome country house.But let us pursue our way.There, just above the ancient Abbey of Holyrood, are the superb cliffs called Salisbury Crags.Arthur’s Seat rises above them, and that is where we are going.From the summit of Arthur’s Seat, Nell, your eyes shall behold the sun appear above the horizon seaward.”"
"他们进入了皇家公园，接着，慢慢地向上走，穿过皇后大道，这是一条盘山行车通道，沃尔特·斯科特爵士曾在他的浪漫史诗中描写过它。","They entered the King’s Park, then, gradually ascending they passed across the Queen’s Drive, a splendid carriageway encircling the hill, which we owe to a few lines in one of Sir Walter Scott’s romances."
"阿瑟王宝座山实际上只是一个七百五十英尺高的山丘，独自耸立在四周的高地中。不到半小时，詹姆斯·斯塔尔他们一行人通过一条曲曲折折的捷径到达了蹲付的狮子的头部。从西面望去，阿瑟王宝座山很像一头蹲伏的狮子。他们四个人在那里坐了下来，詹姆斯·斯塔尔甚至已经准备好了伟大的苏格兰小说家的语录，但他却简单地说道：“让我们听听沃尔特·斯科特在《中洛锡安郡的心脏》第八章中所说的：‘如果我要选择一个看日出日落的最佳地点，那就是这里。’看，内尔！太阳很快就要出来了，你将第一次体会它的壮丽。”","Arthur’s Seat is in truth only a hill, seven hundred and fifty feet high, which stands alone amid surrounding heights.In less than half an hour, by an easy winding path, James Starr and his party reached the crest of the crouching lion, which, seen from the west, Arthur’s Seat so much resembles.There, all four seated themselves; and James Starr, ever ready with quotations from the great Scottish novelist, simply said, “Listen to what is written by Sir Walter Scott in the eighth chapter of the Heart of Mid-Lothian.‘If I were to choose a spot from which the rising or setting sun could be seen to the greatest possible advantage, it would be from this neighborhood.’Now watch, Nell! the sun will soon appear, and for the first time you will contemplate its splendor.”"
"这位少女将视线转向东方。哈里紧紧地跟在内尔旁边，担忧地注视着她。白天的第一束光亮会让她受不了吗？所有的人都保持着安静，包括杰克·瑞安。一道淡淡的浅玫瑰色给地平线上薄薄的蒸汽着了一层色。这第一缕光线赶走了夜晚。寂静的城市躺在山丘下，在破晓的光辉中错落不齐地聚成一片。老城的各处房子里都闪烁着光亮。西边有好几座山顶，很快就被几缕火光照亮了。","The maiden turned her eyes eastward.Harry, keeping close beside her, observed her with anxious interest.Would the first beams of day overpower her feelings?All remained quiet, even Jack Ryan.A faint streak of pale rose tinted the light vapors of the horizon.It was the first ray of light attacking the laggards of the night.Beneath the hill lay the silent city, massed confusedly in the twilight of dawn.Here and there lights twinkled among the houses of the old town.Westward rose many hill-tops, soon to be illuminated by tips of fire."
"现在，远处的海平面变得更清晰可见了。色阶可以按照太阳光谱的顺序划分。颜色的密度很快地加深，玫瑰红变成大红，大红变成火红，这时日光出现了。此刻，内尔打量着轮廓变得更加清晰的城市。巍峨的纪念碑，尖尖的教堂尖塔从黑暗中显现出来，一丝模糊的光亮扩散开。最后，一缕光线闯入了内尔的眼睛。那是在早上或晚上当地平线清晰可见时从海面上反射过来的一缕绿色光线。","Now the distant horizon of the sea became more plainly visible.The scale of colors fell into the order of the solar.Every instant they increased in intensity, rose color became red, red became fiery, daylight dawned.Nell now glanced towards the city, of which the outlines became more distinct.Lofty monuments, slender steeples emerged from the gloom; a kind of ashy light was spread abroad.At length one solitary ray struck on the maiden’s sight.It was that ray of green which, morning or evening, is reflected upwards from the sea when the horizon is clear."
"一会儿之后，内尔转过身，指向新城区那个明亮的突出点，“火！”她大声说道。","An instant afterwards, Nell turned, and pointing towards a bright prominent point in the New Town, “Fire!” cried she."
"“不，内尔，那不是火，”哈里说道，“太阳的金色光线已经照到了沃尔特·斯科特爵士纪念碑的顶端。”——的确，这个纪念碑的顶端闪闪发光，就像一个发光的灯塔。","“No, Nell, that is no fire,” said Harry.“The sun has touched with gold the top of Sir Walter Scott’s monument”—and, indeed, the extreme point of the monument blazed like the light of a pharos."
"天亮了——太阳升起来了——圆圆的太阳闪耀着，好像真的是从海水里出来的一般。刚开始由于折射的效果太阳显得非常大，接着太阳一边上升一边变小，呈现为标准的圆形。很快，人们的眼睛便忍受不了那灼目的光芒。它好像在天空中打开了一个熔炉口。","It was day—the sun arose—his disc seemed to glitter as though he indeed emerged from the waters of the sea.Appearing at first very large from the effects of refraction, he contracted as he rose and assumed the perfectly circular form.Soon no eye could endure the dazzling splendor; it was as though the mouth of a furnace was opened through the sky. "
"内尔闭上眼睛，但她的眼皮阻挡不了这强光，她便用手指遮住了眼睛。哈里建议她背过身去。“噢，不，”内尔说道，“我的眼睛必须习惯看到你们的眼睛所能看见的一切！”","Nell closed her eyes, but her eyelids could not exclude the glare, and she pressed her fingers over them.Harry advised her to turn in the opposite direction.“Oh, no,” said she, “my eyes must get used to look at what yours can bear to see!”"
"即使用手挡住了眼睛，内尔也能觉察到一缕玫瑰色的光线，当太阳升到地平线以上后这缕光线变得越来越白。当她的视力慢慢地习惯后，她的眼皮抬了起来，最后她的眼睛沉醉在白天的光亮中。","Even through her hands Nell perceived a rosy light, which became more white as the sun rose above the horizon.As her sight became accustomed to it, her eyelids were raised, and at length her eyes drank in the light of day."
"这善良的孩子跪了下来，惊叹道：“哦，我的上帝！您的杰作真美啊！”随后她站起来向四周张望着。呈现在她脚下的是爱丁堡的全景——新城里清晰明了的街道格局、杂乱的住宅区和那令人费解的街道网构成了奥尔德里基——人们这样恰当地称呼这个地方。两块高地撑起了这个城市；大块玄武岩顶部的爱丁堡城堡，圆顶的卡尔顿山，还有一些纪念碑，其中包括为纪念雅典帕提侬神庙所建的遗址。","The good child knelt down, exclaiming, “Oh Lord God! how beautiful is Thy creation!”Then she rose and looked around.At her feet extended the panorama of Edinburgh—the clear, distinct lines of streets in the New Town, and the irregular mass of houses, with their confused network of streets and lanes, which constitutes Auld Reekie, properly so called.Two heights commanded the entire city; Edinburgh Castle, crowning its huge basaltic rock, and the Calton Hill, bearing on its rounded summit, among other monuments, ruins built to represent those of the Parthenon at Athens."
"从首府出去的大路四通八达。在北方，壮丽的福斯河海岸线因一个深海湾而缩了进去，在那里可以看见海港小镇利斯。在利斯和这个北方的现代雅典之间有一条街道，笔直地通向比雷埃夫斯。","Fine roadways led in all directions from the capital.To the north, the coast of the noble Firth of Forth was indented by a deep bay, in which could be seen the seaport town of Leith, between which and this Modern Athens of the north ran a street, straight as that leading to the Piraeus."
"越过那宽阔的海湾能看见法夫郡模糊的轮廓，在这些景观下面延伸着波托贝洛和纽黑文的黄色沙滩。","Beyond the wide Firth could be seen the soft outlines of the county of Fife, while beneath the spectator stretched the yellow sands of Portobello and Newhaven."
"内尔说不出话来。她嘴里含糊地咕哝着一两个词；她颤抖着，开始发晕，接着没有了力气；她被纯净的空气和壮丽的景色震撼了，昏倒在哈里的怀中。哈里一直在紧紧地注视着她，随时准备扶住她。","Nell could not speak.Her lips murmured a word or two indistinctly; she trembled, became giddy, her strength failed her; overcome by the purity of the air and the sublimity of the scene, she sank fainting into Harry’s arms, who, watching her closely, was ready to support her."
"这个年轻的少女在此之前都被隐藏在地底幽暗的深处，现在对宇宙——上帝和人类的杰作——有了一个概念。她看过了城镇和乡村之后，又看见了广阔的大海和无垠的天空。","The youthful maiden, hitherto entombed in the massive depths of the earth, had now obtained an idea of the universe—of the works both of God and of man.She had looked upon town and country, and beyond these, into the immensity of the sea, the infinity of the heavens."
"第十五章　洛蒙德湖和卡特琳湖","CHAPTER XV LOCH LOMOND AND LOCH KATRINE"
"哈里扶着内尔，沿着阿瑟王宝座山的斜坡小心翼翼地往下走，在詹姆斯·斯塔尔和杰克·瑞安的陪伴下，他们到达了兰伯特酒店。在那里，他们吃了一顿丰盛的早餐，恢复了体力，开始为去高地湖的短途旅行作进一步的安排。","Harry bore Nell carefully down the steeps of Arthur’s Seat, and, accompanied by James Starr and Jack Ryan, they reached Lambert’s Hotel.There a good breakfast restored their strength, and they began to make further plans for an excursion to the Highland lakes."
"现在，内尔恢复了精神，能够大胆地直视阳光，她的肺则轻松地呼吸着自由而健康的空气。当她的眼睛看到绿树、蓝天以及所有美丽花卉的万千色彩时，她很高兴地学习着这些和谐而各异的颜色。","Nell was now refreshed, and able to look boldly forth into the sunshine, while her lungs with ease inhaled the free and healthful air.Her eyes learned gladly to know the harmonious varieties of color as they rested on the green trees, the azure skies, and all the endless shades of lovely flowers and plants."
"他们在韦弗利站上了火车，火车将把内尔和她的朋友们送到格拉斯哥。在那里，在横跨克莱德的新桥那里，他们注视着像海水般奇妙流动的河水。在科姆里皇家酒店休息了一晚后，他们坐上从爱丁堡到格拉斯哥的火车，直达其终点站。在那里，火车将很快将他们送到洛蒙德湖的最南端，途中经过邓巴顿和巴勒赫。","The railway train, which they entered at the Waverley Station, conveyed Nell and her friends to Glasgow.There, from the new bridge across the Clyde, they watched the curious sea-like movement of the river.After a night’s rest at Comrie’s Royal Hotel, they betook themselves to the terminus of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, from whence a train would rapidly carry them, by way of Dumbarton and Balloch, to the southern extremity of Loch Lomond."
"“现在要去罗布·罗伊和弗格斯·麦基弗的故乡了！——它的景色因沃尔特·斯科特的诗歌描写而名垂千古。”詹姆斯·斯塔尔叫道，“你不知道这个地方吗，杰克？”","“Now for the land of Rob Roy and Fergus MacIvor!—the scenery immortalized by the poetical descriptions of Walter Scott,” exclaimed James Starr.“You don’t know this country, Jack?”"
"“我只听过关于它的歌，斯塔尔先生，”杰克回答道，“从那些歌中判断，这个地方一定很壮丽。”","“Only by its songs, Mr. Starr,” replied Jack; “and judging by those, it must be grand.”"
"“是这样的，是这样的！”工程师叫道，“我们亲爱的内尔将会看到它最好的一面。”","“So it is, so it is!” cried the engineer, “and our dear Nell shall see it to the best advantage.”"
"一艘名为“辛克莱”的汽船等候着即将去湖边旅行的游客。内尔和她的同伴们上了船。这天一开始便阳光明媚，没有经常笼罩着不列颠天空的雾气。","A steamboat, the Sinclair by name, awaited tourists about to make the excursion to the lakes.Nell and her companions went on board.The day had begun in brilliant sunshine, free from the British fogs which so often veil the skies."
"乘客们决定要饱览这三十英里航程中出现的任何一处自然美景。内尔坐在詹姆斯·斯塔尔和哈里的中间，尽情地欣赏着苏格兰风景的浓厚诗意。很快，许多小岛出现了，它们就像是被密集地播撒在湖中似的。“辛克莱”号汽船在这些小岛之间穿行，人们可以在小岛间看见静谧的山谷，或是陆地上险峻多岩的峡谷。","The passengers were determined to lose none of the beauties of nature to be displayed during the thirty miles’ voyage.Nell, seated between James Starr and Harry, drank in with every faculty the magnificent poetry with which lovely Scottish scenery is fraught.Numerous small isles and islets soon appeared, as though thickly sown on the bosom of the lake.The Sincair steamed her way among them, while between them glimpses could be had of quiet valleys, or wild rocky gorges on the mainland."
"“内尔，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“这儿的每一个岛屿以及那些遮蔽着湖泊的山脉都有自己的传说或是歌曲。可以毫不夸张地说，这个国家的历史就是由山脉和岛屿这些巨大的文字书写的。”","“Nell,” said James Starr, “every island here has its legend, perhaps its song, as well as the mountains which overshadow the lake.One may, without much exaggeration, say that the history of this country is written in gigantic characters of mountains and islands.”"
"内尔留心听着，但这些战争故事让她难过。为什么在她看来似乎很广阔的平原上会有流血事件发生？在那儿每个人都肯定会有空间啊。","Nell listened, but these fighting stories made her sad.Why all that bloodshed on plains which to her seemed enormous, and where surely there must have been room for everybody?"
"拉斯湖的岸边形成了一个小港湾。很快内尔就可以看见这座古堡的旧塔。接着，“辛克莱”号向北转了，游客们盯着几乎高出湖面3000英尺的本洛蒙德山。","The shores of the lake form a little harbor at Luss.Nell could for a moment catch sight of the old tower of its ancient castle.Then, the Sinclair turning northward, the tourists gazed upon Ben Lomond, towering nearly 3,000 feet above the level of the lake."
"“啊，多么宏伟的一座山啊！”内尔大叫道，“从山顶上看该是多么壮观啊！”","“Oh, what a noble mountain!” cried Nell, “what a view there must be from the top!”"
"“是的，内尔，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔回答道,“看它的顶峰从覆盖山脉低处的橡树、桦树和欧石南中高傲地耸起！从那里人们可以看见古喀里多尼亚三分之二的地方。湖的东边是麦克格雷戈家族的世宅。不远处，英国詹姆斯二世的追随者和英国汉诺威王室的成员及其追随者之间曾战争不断，鲜血染红了这些孤寂的峡谷。苍白的月亮照耀在这些景物上方，在古民谣里它被称为“麦克法兰的灯笼”。","“Yes, Nell,” answered James Starr; “see how haughtily its peak rises from amidst the thicket of oaks, birches, and heather, which clothe the lower portion of the mountain!From thence one may see two-thirds of old Caledonia.This eastern side of the lake was the special abode of the clan McGregor.At no great distance, the struggles of the Jacobites and Hanoverians repeatedly dyed with blood these lonely glens.Over these scenes shines the pale moon, called in old ballads ‘Macfarlane’s lantern.’"
"罗布·罗伊和麦克格雷戈·坎贝尔这两个不朽的名字仍在这些岩石中回荡着。","Among these rocks still echo the immortal names of Rob Roy and McGregor Campbell."
"“辛克莱”号沿着山脚前行，乡村特色也愈发明显。树木零散地矗立在四周，其中有些是柳树，从前那细长的柳枝是被用来绞死下等人的。","As the Sinclair advanced along the base of the mountain, the country became more and more abrupt in character.Trees were only scattered here and there; among them were the willows, slender wands of which were formerly used for hanging persons of low degree."
"“那是为了节约大麻。”詹姆斯·斯塔尔解释道。","“To economize hemp,” remarked James Starr."
"当湖泊向北延伸时，就变得非常狭窄了。","The lake narrowed very much as it stretched northwards."
"汽船又穿过了几个岛屿，在殷夫鲁格拉斯和艾莱德湖还留有麦克法兰家族大本营的废墟。终于到了湖的顶端，“辛克莱”号停在了英凡斯奈德。","The steamer passed a few more islets, Inveruglas, Eilad-whow, where stand some ruins of a stronghold of the clan MacFarlane.At length the head of the loch was reached, and the Sinclair stopped at Inversnaid."
"离开左边的阿克立特湖，一个陡坡通向位于卡特琳湖岸边的斯特罗纳赫拉赫酒店。","Leaving Loch Arklet on the left, a steep ascent led to the Inn of Stronachlacar, on the banks of Loch Katrine."
"那儿，在一个小桥墩末端，漂浮着一艘小蒸汽船，船名自然是“罗布·罗伊”。游客们很快就上了船；船即将出发。卡特琳湖长只有十英里，宽不超过两英里。离湖最近的山充满了一种独特的气质。","There, at the end of a light pier, floated a small steamboat, named, as a matter of course, the Rob Roy.The travelers immediately went on board; it was about to start.Loch Katrine is only ten miles in length; its width never exceeds two miles.The hills nearest it are full of a character peculiar to themselves."
"“现在我们就在这个著名的湖上了。”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“由于它的长度特点和曲折的形状，人们将其比作一条鳗鱼，这比喻很合适。据说这湖从不结冰。我对此也不清楚，但我们应该想到的是，这里是“湖夫人”的历险场地。我相信，如果朋友杰克仔细地看看四周，他可能会看见美丽的埃伦·道格拉斯那苗条的身影仍滑行在湖面上。”","“Here we are on this famous lake,” said James Starr.“It has been compared to an eel on account of its length and windings: and justly so.They say that it never freezes.I know nothing about that, but what we want to think of is, that here are the scenes of the adventures in the Lady of the Lake.I believe, if friend Jack looked about him carefully, he might see, still gliding over the surface of the water, the shade of the slender form of sweet Ellen Douglas.”"
"“那是肯定的，斯塔尔先生，”杰克说道，“为什么不呢？我也许还能看见卡特琳湖面上漂亮的女孩，还有煤矿井里马尔科姆湖上的那些丑陋幽灵。”","“To be sure, Mr. Starr,” replied Jack; “why should I not?I may just as well see that pretty girl on the waters of Loch Katrine, as those ugly ghosts on Loch Malcolm in the coal pit.”"
"现在是下午三点钟了。卡特琳湖山丘较少的湖岸向西延伸，就像一幅镶嵌在本·安和本·凡纽之间的图画。还有半英里就可到达狭窄海湾的入口了，游客们将在那里着陆，并打算从卡伦德返回斯特林郡。","It was by this time three o’clock in the afternoon.The less hilly shores of Loch Katrine westward extended like a picture framed between Ben An and Ben Venue.At the distance of half a mile was the entrance to the narrow bay, where was the landing-place for our tourists, who meant to return to Stirling by Callander."
"内尔看上去被这一整天持续不断的兴奋给累垮了。当看见惊奇或美丽的新事物时，她只能发出一丝微弱的叫声来表示赞美。她需要休息几个小时，只是为了将她所看见的一切牢牢地印在脑海里。","Nell appeared completely worn out by the continued excitement of the day.A faint ejaculation was all she was able to utter in token of admiration as new objects of wonder or beauty met her gaze.She required some hours of rest, were it but to impress lastingly the recollection of all she had seen."
"哈里握着内尔的手，真诚地看着她说道：“内尔，亲爱的内尔，我们很快就要回到煤矿黑暗处的家了。难道你不渴望得到在这阳光充足的几小时里所看到的这些吗？”","Her hand rested in Harry’s, and, looking earnestly at her, he said, “Nell, dear Nell, we shall soon be home again in the gloomy region of the coal mine.Shall you not pine for what you have seen during these few hours spent in the glorious light of day?”"
"“不，哈里，”女孩回答道，“我会想它的，但是能和你一起回到我们亲爱的老家，我很高兴。”","“No, Harry,” replied the girl; “I shall like to think about it, but I am glad to go back with you to our dear old home.”"
"“内尔！”哈里情不自禁地用颤抖的嗓音说道，“你愿意和我以一种最神圣的关系结合在一起吗？你愿意嫁给我吗，内尔？”","“Nell!” said Harry, vainly attempting to steady his voice, “are you willing to be bound to me by the most sacred tie?Could you marry me, Nell?”"
"“是的，哈里，我愿意，如果你确定我能给你带来快乐的话。”这个少女回答道，抬起双眼天真无邪地看着哈里的眼睛。","“Yes, Harry, I could, if you are sure that I am able to make you happy,” answered the maiden, raising her innocent eyes to his."
"她刚一说完这些话，一个令人费解的现象就发生了。在距离陆地还有半英里处，“罗布·罗伊”号猛地震了一下。船突然搁浅了。引擎再怎么努力也无法启动了。","Scarcely had she pronounced these words when an unaccountable phenomenon took place.The Rob Roy, still half a mile from land, experienced a violent shock.She suddenly grounded.No efforts of the engine could move her."
"而这一事故的原因仅仅是因为卡特琳湖突然被排空了，就像湖床里开了一个巨大的裂缝。几秒钟之后，人们就看见了浅水域里的海滩。湖里几乎所有的东西都消失到地里。","The cause of this accident was simply that Loch Katrine was all at once emptied, as though an enormous fissure had opened in its bed.In a few seconds it had the appearance of a sea beach at low water.Nearly the whole of its contents had vanished into the bosom of the earth."
"“我的朋友！”詹姆斯·斯塔尔惊叫道，因为他突然知道了这个神秘事件的原因，“愿上帝庇佑新阿伯福伊尔！”","“My friends!” exclaimed James Starr, as the cause of this marvel became suddenly clear to him, “God help New Aberfoyle!”"
"第十六章 最后的威胁","CHAPTER XVI A FINAL THREAT"
"那天，在新阿伯福伊尔的煤矿区，工作和平常一样进行着。远处传来了炸药的巨大爆炸声，含碳岩石爆破了。这里鹤嘴锄和铁撬挖松了大量的煤炭；那里钻孔机伴随着尖锐刺耳的声音打穿了大量的砂岩和片岩。","On that day, in the colliery of New Aberfoyle, work was going on in the usual regular way.In the distance could be heard the crash of great charges of dynamite, by which the carboniferous rocks were blasted.Here masses of coal were loosened by pick-ax and crowbar; there the perforating machines, with their harsh grating, bored through the masses of sandstone and schist."
"空洞的瓮声到处回响。一阵阵气流沿着通风走廊乱窜，木制的旋转门在这猛烈的强风推动下砰地关上了。在下面的隧道里，一列列货运火车一直以十五英里的时速驶过，当它们快到的时候，电子铃会警告工人们躲进安全的地方。升降机由地面上强大的引擎带动着不断地运转。电力充足的电灯把煤城照得通亮。","Hollow, cavernous noises resounded on all sides.Draughts of air rushed along the ventilating galleries, and the wooden swing-doors slammed beneath their violent gusts.In the lower tunnels, trains of trucks kept passing along at the rate of fifteen miles an hour, while at their approach electric bells warned the workmen to cower down in the refuge places.Lifts went incessantly up and down, worked by powerful engines on the surface of the soil.Coal Town was throughout brilliantly lighted by the electric lamps at full power."
"开采工作正在最大限度地进行着；煤块不断地被堆到了货车里，几百列货车来到井下将煤块清空到矿车里。当上夜班的矿工们进行休息时，其余的人一小时也不耽误地开工了。","Mining operations were being carried on with the greatest activity; coal was being piled incessantly into the trucks, which went in hundreds to empty themselves into the corves at the bottom of the shaft.While parties of miners who had labored during the night were taking needful rest, the others worked without wasting an hour."
"老西蒙·福特和马奇吃完了饭，在村舍的门边休息。西蒙好好地抽了一斗烟，老两口时不时地谈到内尔、他们的儿子以及斯塔尔先生，并想知道他们有多喜欢这次地面之行。他们现在会在哪里呢？他们正在干什么呢？他们怎么可以离开煤矿那么久而不想家呢？","Old Simon Ford and Madge, having finished their dinner, were resting at the door of their cottage.Simon smoked a good pipe of tobacco, and from time to time the old couple spoke of Nell, of their boy, of Mr. Starr, and wondered how they liked their trip to the surface of the earth.Where would they be now?What would they be doing?How could they stay so long away from the mine without feeling homesick?"
"这时，一阵骇人的轰鸣声传了过来。这声音就像一条巨大的瀑布倾泻到煤矿里所发出的声音。老两口猛地站了起来。他们立即看到马尔科姆湖在涨水。一股巨浪如汹涌的波涛般扬起，掠过湖岸并在村舍的墙上撞得粉碎。西蒙把妻子抱在怀里，并把她带到房间的上面。","Just then a terrific roaring noise was heard.It was like the sound of a mighty cataract rushing down into the mine.The old people rose hastily.They perceived at once that the waters of Loch Malcolm were rising.A great wave, unfurling like a billow, swept up the bank and broke against the walls of the cottage.Simon caught his wife in his arms, and carried her to the upper part of their dwelling."
"与此同时，煤城各处都响起了一片叫喊声，人们被突如其来的洪水吓坏了。居民们逃生逃到了湖边片岩的顶端，恐惧弥漫在四面八方，惊慌中许多家庭为了爬到煤矿的高处而急急忙忙地冲向了隧道。","At the same moment, cries arose from all parts of Coal Town, which was threatened by a sudden inundation.The inhabitants fled for safety to the top of the schist rocks bordering the lake; terror spread in all directions; whole families in frantic haste rushed towards the tunnel in order to reach the upper regions of the pit."
"人们害怕是海水突然涌入了煤矿，因为煤矿的水平巷道和通道一直延伸至喀里多尼亚运河。如果是那样，整个挖掘区即使再大也会被完全淹没。新阿伯福伊尔地区将无人能逃过此劫。","It was feared that the sea had burst into the colliery, for its galleries and passages penetrated as far as the Caledonian Canal.In that case the entire excavation, vast as it was, would be completely flooded.Not a single inhabitant of New Aberfoyle would escape death."
"但是当第一批逃难者跑到隧道入口处时，他们遇到了已经离开村舍的西蒙·福特。“停下，我的朋友们，停下！”老人喊道，“要是我们的城镇被淹，洪水跑得会比你们更快，没人能逃脱。但是快看！洪水不再上涨了！在我看来危险已经过去了。”","But when the foremost fugitives reached the entrance to the tunnel, they encountered Simon Ford, who had quitted his cottage.“Stop, my friends, stop!” shouted the old man; “if our town is to be overwhelmed, the floods will rush faster than you can; no one can possibly escape.But see! the waters are rising no further! it appears to me the danger is over.”"
"“可在工程尽头的伙伴们——他们怎么办？”其中一些矿工叫道。","“And our comrades at the far end of the works—what about them?” cried some of the miners."
"“不用担心他们，”西蒙答道，“他们是在高于湖床的地方干活。”","“There is nothing to fear for them,” replied Simon; “they are working on a higher level than the bed of the loch.”"
"不久，事实便证明老人的话是正确的。骤然涌入的水冲到了巨大煤矿的最底层，最终只是把马尔科姆湖的水平面抬高了几英尺。煤城没有受到损害，人们也就有理由期望没有人在这次洪灾中丧生，虽然洪水进入了矿工们从未到过的煤矿底部。","It was soon evident that the old man was in the right.The sudden influx of water had rushed to the very lowest bed of the vast mine, and its only ultimate effect was to raise the level of Loch Malcolm a few feet.Coal Town was uninjured, and it was reasonable to hope that no one had perished in the flood of water which had descended to the depths of the mine never yet penetrated by the workmen."
"西蒙和他的伙计们不能确定这次洪灾是因为地下水渗过岩体的裂缝溢出来造成的，还是由于某股地下洪流打穿河床涌入了煤矿的最底层造成的。但是当天晚上他们就明白发生什么事了，因为当地报纸刊登了一篇关于卡特琳湖奇异现象的报道。","Simon and his men could not decide whether this inundation was owing to the overflow of a subterranean sheet of water penetrating fissures in the solid rock, or to some underground torrent breaking through its worn bed, and precipitating itself to the lowest level of the mine.But that very same evening they knew what to think about it, for the local papers published an account of the marvelous phenomenon which Loch Katrine had exhibited."
"全速赶回村的四个旅行的人不久就证实了这一惊人的消息，他们满心欢喜地了解到新阿伯福伊尔并没有遭到严重的破坏。","The surprising news was soon after confirmed by the four travelers, who, returning with all possible speed to the cottage, learned with extreme satisfaction that no serious damage was done in New Aberfoyle."
"卡特琳湖的湖床完全塌陷。湖水通过一条巨大的裂缝猛然涌到了煤矿下层。这个沃尔特·斯科特爵士最爱的湖，所剩的湖水都不能弄湿“湖夫人”那双漂亮的脚了，剩下的全部湖水就只是一个位于远端的几英亩的池塘。","The bed of Loch Katrine had fairly given way.The waters had suddenly broken through by an enormous fissure into the mine beneath.Of Sir Walter Scott’s favorite loch there was not left enough to wet the pretty foot of the Lady of the Lake; all that remained was a pond of a few acres at the further extremity."
"这个奇异的事件在乡村引起了极大的轰动。从未听说过一个湖会在几分钟内干涸，消失在地下深处。目前能做的只有把卡特琳湖从苏格兰的地图中抹去，直到（通过公共捐款）让它重新蓄满水，当然首先要注意的是不让裂缝漏水。要是沃尔特·斯科特爵士还在世的话，这一灾难就会是他的死讯。","This singular event made a profound sensation in the country.It was a thing unheard of that a lake should in the space of a few minutes empty itself, and disappear into the bowels of the earth.There was nothing for it but to erase Loch Katrine from the map of Scotland until (by public subscription) it could be refilled, care being of course taken, in the first place, to stop the rent up tight.This catastrophe would have been the death of Sir Walter Scott, had he still been in the world."
"事故查明后这一现象就变得明了了，在湖床和下面的巨洞之间，地质层已经变得很薄，再也承受不住水的重量了。","The accident was explicable when it was ascertained that, between the bed of the lake and the vast cavity beneath, the geological strata had become reduced to a thin layer, incapable of longer sustaining the weight of water."
"现在，尽管在大多数人看来这次事件只是由于自然原因引起的，然而对詹姆斯·斯塔尔和他的朋友西蒙以及哈里·福特来说，有个问题不断出现在他们脑海里——这该不会是某种恶行所为吧？不安的疑虑一直侵扰着他们。他们那个邪恶的天才会继续伤害那些冒险在这座富矿上工作的人们吗？","Now, although to most people this event seemed plainly due to natural causes, yet to James Starr and his friends, Simon and Harry Ford, the question constantly recurred, was it not rather to be attributed to malevolence?Uneasy suspicions continually harassed their minds.Was their evil genius about to renew his persecution of those who ventured to work this rich mine?"
"于是几天后，詹姆斯·斯塔尔在村舍与老人和他儿子谈起这件事。“嗯，西蒙，”他说，“我想，虽然这事确实有可能是自然原因造成的，但是我们还是要把这事和我们试图解释的那些事归为一类。”","At the cottage, some days later, James Starr thus discussed the matter with the old man and his son: “Well, Simon,” said he, “to my thinking we must class this circumstance with the others for which we still seek elucidation, although it is no doubt possible to explain it by natural causes.”"
"“我非常赞同您的看法，詹姆斯先生，”西蒙答道，“但按我的意见，不要把这事说出去，我们自己去调查这件事。”","“I am quite of your mind, Mr. James,” replied Simon, “but take my advice, and say nothing about it; let us make all researches ourselves.”"
"“哦，我早就知道这个调查的结果了！”工程师喊道。","“Oh, I know the result of such research beforehand!” cried the engineer."
"“那么是什么？”","“And what will it be, then?”"
"“我们要找到恶行的证据，但不是那个坏蛋。”","“We shall find proofs of malevolence, but not the malefactor.”"
"“可他是存在啊！他就在那里！他能藏在哪里呢？能否设想，这个最邪恶的人能够独自将炸穿湖床这个歹毒的想法付诸实践？我不愿再深究，而宁愿像杰克·瑞安一样，相信矿里的恶魔因我们侵占了他的领地而报复我们。”","“But he exists! he is there!Where can he lie concealed?Is it possible to conceive that the most depraved human being could, single-handed, carry out an idea so infernal as that of bursting through the bed of a lake?I believe I shall end by thinking, like Jack Ryan, that the evil demon of the mine revenges himself on us for having invaded his domain.”"
"他们不让内尔听到太多与此相关的谈话。实际上，她也不想加入他们，尽管很明显她和她的养父母一样在担心。她脸上的忧虑表明了她内心极度不安。","Nell was allowed to hear as little as possible of these discussions.Indeed, she showed no desire to enter into them, although it was very evident that she shared in the anxieties of her adopted parents.The melancholy in her countenance bore witness to much mental agitation."
"最后的决定是，詹姆斯·斯塔尔和西蒙及哈里回到事发地点，努力找出使他们满意的原因。他们没向任何人提起他们的计划。对于那些对整件事不明真相的人们来说，斯塔尔和他朋友们的观点似乎完全不能被接受。","It was at length resolved that James Starr, together with Simon and Harry, should return to the scene of the disaster, and endeavor to satisfy themselves as to the cause of it.They mentioned their project to no one.To those unacquainted with the group of facts on which it was based, the opinion of Starr and his friends could not fail to appear wholly inadmissible."
"几天以后，这三个朋友登上了一条小船，去查看支撑卡特琳湖盆泥块的天然柱子。他们发现他们猜的是对的，那些巨大的圆柱已被炸坏了。爆炸留下的黑色痕迹依然可以看见，湖水已经下沉到发生这些神秘行为的地方以下了。因此，经证实，巨大的拱形穹顶坍塌的那部分是有人预谋的，并且是人为的。","A few days later, the three friends proceeded in a small boat to examine the natural pillars on which had rested the solid earth forming the basin of Loch Katrine.They discovered that they had been right in suspecting that the massive columns had been undermined by blasting.The blackened traces of explosion were to be seen, the waters having subsided below the level of these mysterious operations. Thus the fall of a portion of the vast vaulted dome was proved to have been premeditated by man, and by man’s hand had it been effected."
"“毋庸置疑，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“如果涌进来的是海水而不是小湖的水，谁又能说不会发生些什么呢？”","“It is impossible to doubt it,” said James Starr; “and who can say what might not have happened had the sea, instead of a little loch, been let in upon us?”"
"“你可以那么说，”老工头满怀对心爱煤矿的骄傲之情喊道，“因为少于一个海的水是别想淹没我们的阿伯福伊尔的。但是，再想想，会有人在破坏我们的工作中可能得到什么利益呢？”","“You may well say that,” cried the old overman, with a feeling of pride in his beloved mine; “for nothing less than a sea would have drowned our Aberfoyle.But, once more, what possible interest could any human being have in the destruction of our works?”"
"“这很费解，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔答道，“这事干得不错，不像是那伙藏在山洞并出来抢劫掠夺周围村庄的普通罪犯干的。三年来这些人的恶行肯定会暴露他们的行径和藏身之处。也不可能像我有时候想的那样，走私犯或伪钞制造者在这些巨大山洞里不为人所知的偏僻角落做着非法勾当，因此急切地想把我们赶走。但是没人造伪钞或者走私物品仅仅是为了隐藏自己！","“It is quite incomprehensible,” replied James Starr.“This case is something perfectly unlike that of a band of common criminals, who, concealing themselves in dens and caves, go forth to rob and pillage the surrounding country.The evil deeds of such men would certainly, in the course of three years have betrayed their existence and lurking-places.Neither can it be, as I sometimes used to think, that smugglers or coiners carried on their illegal practices in some distant and unknown corner of these prodigious caverns, and were consequently anxious to drive us out of them.But no one coins false money or obtains contraband goods only to conceal them!"
"“然而很明显，有一个难平心中怨气的仇敌发誓要毁掉新阿伯福伊尔，并且他在某种利益的驱使下用尽一切可能的办法来向我们报复。他似乎力量太小，还不足以采取公开行动。他秘密谋划着，但他显示出的才干表明他是一个难以对付的敌人。","“Yet it is clear that an implacable enemy has sworn the ruin of New Aberfoyle, and that some interest urges him to seek in every possible way to wreak his hatred upon us.He appears to be too weak to act openly, and lays his schemes in secret; but displays such intelligence as to render him a most formidable foe."
"“我的朋友们，他肯定比我们更了解我们领地里的秘密，因为他总是能避过我们的警戒。他在煤矿业肯定经验丰富，百里挑一——这是肯定的，西蒙！我们已有足够的证据证明这一点。","“My friends, he must understand better than we do the secrets of our domain, since he has all this time eluded our vigilance.He must be a man experienced in mining, skilled beyond the most skillful—that’s certain, Simon!We have proof enough of that."
"“让我想想！难道您没有哪个私人仇敌值得怀疑？好好想一想！肯定有件连时间也抹不平的仇恨。回想一下您早年的事情。发生在我们身上的事情似乎是一个严酷而有耐性的人干的，要弄清这件事还需要努力地思考与回忆。”","“Let me see!Have you never had a personal enemy, to whom your suspicions might point?Think well!There is such a thing as hatred which time never softens.Go back to recollections of your earliest days.What befalls us appears the work of a stern and patient will, and to explain it demands every effort of thought and memory.”"
"西蒙没有立刻回答——很明显他是在仔细而坦诚地回忆过去的生活。不久，他抬起头，“没有，”他说道，“绝对没有！上苍为我作证，马奇和我都没有伤害过任何人。我们不相信在世上我们有任何仇敌。”","Simon did not answer immediately—his mind evidently engaged in a close and candid survey of his past life.Presently, raising his head, “No,” said he; “no!Heaven be my witness, neither Madge nor I have ever injured anybody.We cannot believe that we have a single enemy in the world.”"
"“啊！要是内尔能开口就好了！”工程师叫道。","“Ah! if Nell would only speak!” cried the engineer."
"“斯塔尔先生——还有您，父亲，”哈里说道，“我求求你们对这件事保持沉默，不要去问我可怜的内尔。我知道她非常焦虑不安，我也能确定某个大秘密在折磨着她。也许她一无所知，那我们去问她也是毫无收获，也许她认为保持沉默是她的责任。千万不要去怀疑她对我们大家的感情——对我们所有人的感情。如果将来某个时候她告诉了我她目前还对我们隐瞒的事情，你们就会立即知道。”","“Mr. Starr—and you, father,” said Harry, “I do beg of you to keep silence on this matter, and not to question my poor Nell.I know she is very anxious and uneasy; and I feel positive that some great secret painfully oppresses her heart.Either she knows nothing it would be of any use for us to hear, or she considers it her duty to be silent.It is impossible to doubt her affection for us—for all of us.If at a future time she informs me of what she has hitherto concealed from us, you shall know about it immediately.”"
"“那就这样吧，哈里，”工程师回答道，“但我仍然要说，如果内尔知道一些事，她的沉默对我来说完全不能理解。”","“So be it, then, Harry,” answered the engineer; “and yet I must say Nell’s silence, if she knows anything, is to me perfectly inexplicable.”"
"哈里还想继续为她辩护，但工程师阻止了他，说道：“好的，哈里，我们答应不再对你的未婚妻说这件事了。”","Harry would have continued her defense; but the engineer stopped him, saying, “All right, Harry; we promise to say no more about it to your future wife.”"
"“要是我父亲同意，她就会马上成为我的妻子。”","“With my father’s consent she shall be my wife without further delay.”"
"“我的儿子，”老西蒙说道，“你的婚礼会在下个月的这天举行。斯塔尔先生，您愿意当内尔的父亲吗？”","“My boy,” said old Simon, “your marriage shall take place this very day month.Mr. Starr, will you undertake the part of Nell’s father?”"
"“您找对人了，西蒙。”工程师回答道。","“You may reckon upon me for that, Simon,” answered the engineer."
"然后他们回到村舍，但对矿里的检查结果只字未提。因此在矿里的其他居民看来，洞穴拱顶的爆炸依然只是一次意外事件。苏格兰只是少了个湖而已。","They then returned to the cottage, but said not a word of the result of their examinations in the mine, so that to the rest of its inhabitants, the bursting in of the vaulted roof of the caverns continued to be regarded as a mere accident.There was but a loch the less in Scotland."
"内尔逐渐恢复了日常工作，而哈里也充分利用那次地上的短暂旅程教了她很多东西。她喜欢回忆地面上的生活，但没有丝毫遗憾。在她还是个孩子的时候就爱着这个黑暗的地方，并且将在这里度过她的婚姻生活，她将永远爱着这里。","Nell gradually resumed her customary duties, and Harry made good use of her little visit to the upper air, in the instructions he gave her.She enjoyed the recollections of life above ground, yet without regretting it.The somber region she had loved as a child, and in which her wedded life would be spent, was as dear to her as ever."
"即将举行的婚礼让新阿伯福伊尔的人们激动万分。美好的祝福从四面八方传来，其中最热烈的是杰克·瑞安的祝福。人们发现他在忙着为婚礼练习他最拿手的歌曲，这场婚礼可是邀请了全体煤城人民共同庆祝的。","The approaching marriage created great excitement in New Aberfoyle.Good wishes poured in on all sides, and foremost among them were Jack Ryan’s.He was detected busily practicing his best songs in preparation for the great day, which was to be celebrated by the whole population of Coal Town."
"婚礼前的那个月，新阿伯福伊尔发生的事故前所未有地多。人们甚至想过是哈里和内尔的即将结合引发了一次又一次的灾难。这些不幸的事主要是发生在井下工程的最深最底层，事故的原因总是有些神秘。","During the month preceding the wedding-day, there were more accidents occurring in New Aberfoyle than had ever been known in the place.One would have thought the approaching union of Harry and Nell actually provoked one catastrophe after another.These misfortunes happened chiefly at the further and lowest extremity of the works, and the cause of them was always in some way mysterious."
"这样，举例说，远处水平巷道上的木支架着火了，哈里和他的同伴们冒着生命危险用装着碳酸水的灭火器把火扑灭了——这些灭火器一直是留着以备不时之需的。纵火者用的那盏灯找到了，但没有线索可以指认出纵火者是谁。","Thus, for instance, the wood-work of a distant gallery was discovered to be in flames, which were extinguished by Harry and his companions at the risk of their lives, by employing engines filled with water and carbonic acid, always kept ready in case of necessity.The lamp used by the incendiary was found; but no clew whatever as to who he could be."
"另一次是储水箱的支柱倒塌引发了一场洪灾，斯塔尔先生坚信这些柱子事先就被锯断了一部分。哈里这段时间一直在这附近监管工程，他被埋在落下的废料中并侥幸逃过一劫。","Another time an inundation took place in consequence of the stanchions of a water-tank giving way; and Mr. Starr ascertained beyond a doubt that these supports had first of all been partially sawn through.Harry, who had been overseeing the works near the place at the time, was buried in the falling rubbish, and narrowly escaped death."
"几天后，在蒸汽电车轨道上，哈里乘坐的那列货车撞到铁轨上的一个障碍翻车了。后来发现是有人把一根梁放在轨道上。总之，此类事故数不胜数，矿工们惊慌了，要求必须工头在场他们才去上工。","A few days afterwards, on the steam tramway, a train of trucks, which Harry was passing along, met with an obstacle on the rails, and was overturned.It was then discovered that a beam had been laid across the line.In short, events of this description became so numerous that the miners were seized with a kind of panic, and it required all the influence of their chiefs to keep them on the works."
"“你会认为有一帮混蛋，”西蒙反复说道，“可我们没有抓到一个。”","“You would think that there was a whole band of these ruffians,” Simon kept saying, “and we can’t lay hands on a single one of them.”"
"人们全方位进行搜查。郡里的警察日夜保持警惕，但一无所获。这险恶用心似乎只是想伤害哈里。斯塔尔禁止他离开工程的正常范围单独去冒险。","Search was made in all directions.The county police were on the alert night and day, yet discovered nothing.The evil intentions seeming specially designed to injure Harry.Starr forbade him to venture alone beyond the ordinary limits of the works."
"他们也同样担心内尔，但是在哈里的恳求下，这些对哈里的恶意伤害都向她隐瞒了，因为这些可能会让她痛苦地想起以前的日子。西蒙和马奇以一种近乎苛刻的体恤日夜关心她。这个可怜的孩子依从他们的愿望，什么也没说，也没抱怨。她意识到了他们这样做是为了她好吗？很可能意识到了。对于她来说，她也似乎关心着其他人，只有所有她爱的人都在村舍里她才放心。","They were equally careful of Nell, although, at Harry’s entreaty, these malicious attempts to do harm were concealed from her, because they might remind her painfully of former times.Simon and Madge watched over her by day and by night with a sort of stern solicitude.The poor child yielded to their wishes, without a remark or a complaint.Did she perceive that they acted with a view to her interest?Probably she did.And on her part, she seemed to watch over others, and was never easy unless all whom she loved were together in the cottage."
"当哈里晚上回到家，她无法克制住她孩子般的喜悦之情，这完全不像她平时话少并且不善于表达感情的样子。只要天一亮，她起得比任何人都早，并且直到人们收工回家的时候她才会放下心。","When Harry came home in the evening, she could not restrain expressions of child-like joy, very unlike her usual manner, which was rather reserved than demonstrative.As soon as day broke, she was astir before anyone else, and her constant uneasiness lasted all day until the hour of return home from work."
"哈里急切地想举行婚礼。他认为，一旦迈出了这不可挽回的一步之后，恶行就会解除，并且内尔只有在成为自己的妻子之后才会感到安心。詹姆斯·斯塔尔、西蒙和马奇全都持同样的观点，每个人都数着剩下的日子，因为每个人都有种强烈的不祥之感。","Harry became very anxious that their marriage should take place.He thought that, when the irrevocable step was taken, malevolence would be disarmed, and that Nell would never feel safe until she was his wife.James Starr, Simon, and Madge, were all of the same opinion, and everyone counted the intervening days, for everyone suffered from the most uncomfortable forebodings."
"很明显，对于这个隐藏的敌人来说，有关内尔的任何事他都不会漠然视之，而人们又不可能看到或者阻止他。因此，她和哈里结婚这一庄严的行为很有可能是他再次宣泄其可怕愤怒的时机。","It was perfectly evident that nothing relating to Nell was indifferent to this hidden foe, whom it was impossible to meet or to avoid.Therefore it seemed quite possible that the solemn act of her marriage with Harry might be the occasion of some new and dreadful outbreak of his hatred."
"婚期前一周的一个早上，内尔起得很早，先于其他任何人走出村舍。一走出门槛她就发出了一声无法形容的痛苦尖叫。","One morning, a week before the day appointed for the ceremony, Nell, rising early, went out of the cottage before anyone else.No sooner had she crossed the threshold than a cry of indescribable anguish escaped her lips."
"整个屋子的人都听到了她的叫声，马奇、哈里和西蒙立刻跑到她身边。内尔脸色苍白，如死了一般，面容扭曲，脸上尽是深深的恐惧。她说不出话来，眼睛盯着她刚刚打开的村舍的门。","Her voice was heard throughout the dwelling; in a moment, Madge, Harry, and Simon were at her side.Nell was pale as death, her countenance agitated, her features expressing the utmost horror.Unable to speak, her eyes were riveted on the door of the cottage, which she had just opened."
"她用僵直的手指指着那人在夜间留下的这些字：“西蒙·福特，你从我手中抢走了我们老矿井的最后矿脉。哈里，你的儿子，从我手中抢走了内尔。灾难会降临到你们头上！灾难会降临到你们所有人头上！灾难会降临新阿伯福伊尔！——西尔法克斯。”","With rigid fingers she pointed to the following words traced upon it during the night: “Simon Ford, you have robbed me of the last vein in our old pit.Harry, your son, has robbed me of Nell.Woe betide you!Woe betide you all!Woe betide New Aberfoyle!—Silfax.”"
"“西尔法克斯！”西蒙和马奇同时惊叫道。","“Silfax!” exclaimed Simon and Madge together."
"“这个人是谁？”哈里问道，一会儿看看他父亲一会儿看看这少女。","“Who is this man?” demanded Harry, looking alternately at his father and at the maiden."
"“西尔法克斯！”内尔用绝望的声音重复着，“西尔法克斯！”——在咕哝这个名字的时候，她整个身子因为恐惧和担心颤栗着，老马奇把她带到了她的房间。","“Silfax!” repeated Nell in tones of despair, “Silfax!”—and, murmuring this name, her whole frame shuddering with fear and agitation, she was borne away to her chamber by old Madge."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔急忙赶到出事地点，把这几句威胁的话读了一遍又一遍。","James Starr, hastening to the spot, read the threatening sentences again and again."
"“写这几行字的人，”最后他说道，“就是给我写那封与你的信相矛盾的信的人，西蒙。这人称自己为西尔法克斯。我能从你不安的样子看出你知道他。谁是这个西尔法克斯？”","“The hand which traced these lines,” said he at length, “is the same which wrote me the letter contradicting yours, Simon.The man calls himself Silfax.I see by your troubled manner that you know him.Who is this Silfax?”"
"第十七章 “修道士”","CHAPTER XVII THE “MONK”"
"这个名字向老工头揭示了一切。他是多查特矿井最后的“修道士”。","This name revealed everything to the old overman.It was that of the last “monk” of the Dochart pit."
"以前没有发明安全灯的时候，西蒙就已经知道了这个脾气暴躁的人，他就算冒着生命危险，也要每天在通道里弄出小范围的瓦斯爆炸。他过去经常看到这个奇怪而孤僻的人在煤矿里游荡，总是有只大而可怕的猫头鹰跟着他，他称之为哈弗昂。在他进行危险的工作时，它会飞起帮他把点着的火柴放到他够不着的地方。","In former days, before the invention of the safety-lamp, Simon had known this fierce man, whose business it was to go daily, at the risk of his life, to produce partial explosions of fire-damp in the passages.He used to see this strange solitary being, prowling about the mine, always accompanied by a monstrous owl, which he called Harfang, who assisted him in his perilous occupation, by soaring with a lighted match to places Silfax was unable to reach."
"一天，这个老头消失了，也就在这时，一个小孤女出生在煤矿里，这个小孤儿除了他——她的曾祖父，没有任何亲人了。很显然这个小孩就是内尔。在她被哈里救出之前的十五年里，他们肯定就住在煤矿的某个秘密深井里。","One day this old man disappeared, and at the same time also, a little orphan girl born in the mine, who had no relation but himself, her great-grandfather.It was perfectly evident now that this child was Nell.During the fifteen years, up to the time when she was saved by Harry, they must have lived in some secret abyss of the mine."
"这个老工头怀着同情和愤怒的复杂感情，把西尔法克斯这个名字让他想起的所有事情都告诉了工程师和哈里。这就解释了所有的神秘事情。西尔法克斯就是让他们在新阿伯福伊尔深处长期搜寻无果的那个神秘人物。","The old overman, full of mingled compassion and anger, made known to the engineer and Harry all that the name of Silfax had revealed to him.It explained the whole mystery.Silfax was the mysterious being so long vainly sought for in the depths of New Aberfoyle."
"“所以您知道他，西蒙？”斯塔尔先生问道。","“So you knew him, Simon?” demanded Mr. Starr."
"“是的，我知道，”工头回答道,“那个带着哈弗昂的人，我们以前常常这样称呼他。哦，他那时就老了！他很可能比我都大十五或二十岁。他是那种粗鲁野蛮的人，对人冷漠，并且人们认为他什么都不怕——不怕火也不怕水。当“修道士”是他自己的爱好，很少有人喜欢这样做。他工作上频繁出现的危险扰乱了他的脑子。他异常强壮，没人能像他那样熟知煤矿——至少，他和我一样熟悉煤矿。他仅靠微薄的津贴生活。事实上，我以为他多年前就死了。”","“Yes, that I did,” replied the overman.“The Harfang man, we used to call him.Why, he was old then!He must be fifteen or twenty years older than I am.A wild, savage sort of fellow, who held aloof from everyone and was known to fear nothing—neither fire nor water.It was his own fancy to follow the trade of ‘monk,’ which few would have liked.The constant danger of the business had unsettled his brain.He was prodigiously strong, and he knew the mine as no one else—at any rate, as well as I did.He lived on a small allowance.In faith, I believed him dead years ago.”"
"“但是，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔继续说道，“他说这些话是什么意思，‘你从我手中抢走了我们旧煤矿的最后矿脉？’”","“But,” resumed James Starr, “what does he mean by those words, ‘You have robbed me of the last vein of our old mine’?”"
"“啊！对，”西蒙回答道，“长期以来这只是他自己的幻想，他觉得自己可以支配阿伯福伊尔煤矿——我告诉过你他脑子不正常。所以，随着多查特矿井——他的矿井——被开采得越来越深，他的脾气也变得越来越暴躁。这就像是鹤嘴锄的每一次敲打都砸在他身上。你肯定记得吧，马奇？”","“Ah! there it is,” replied Simon; “for a long time it had been a fancy of his—I told you his mind was deranged—that he had a right to the mine of Aberfoyle; so he became more and more savage in temper the deeper the Dochart pit—his pit!—was worked out.It just seemed as if it was his own body that suffered from every blow of the pickax.You must remember that, Madge?”"
"“是啊，我记得，西蒙。”她答道。","“Ay, that I do, Simon,” replied she."
"“我能想起所有这些事，”西蒙继续说道，“自从我在门上看到西尔法克斯这个名字之后。但是我告诉你们，我以为这个人已经死了，从来就没有想到我们长期寻找的那个心怀恶意的人就是多查特矿井的老爆破工。”","“I can recollect all this,” resumed Simon, “since I have seen the name of Silfax on the door.But I tell you, I thought the man was dead, and never imagined that the spiteful being we have so long sought for could be the old fireman of the Dochart pit.”"
"“那么，现在，”斯塔尔说道，“一切都很清楚了。西尔法克斯偶然知道了新矿脉的存在。他狂妄自大，认为自己才是这笔财富的主人，必须隐藏并且守卫它。由于他生活在煤矿里，且昼夜游荡，他觉察到你已经发现了这个秘密并立即写信让我来。所以我收到了与你的那封相矛盾的信；于是我到达后，所有事故都发生了，比如，砸向哈里的石块、亚罗井中被毁的梯子、新路堑岩壁上被堵塞的洞口；总之，我们被囚禁，之后又被解救，那是内尔善意的帮助，她肯定是瞒着西尔法克斯，并违背了他的意愿。”","“Well, now, then,” said Starr, “it is all quite plain.Chance made known to Silfax the new vein of coal.With the egotism of madness, he believed himself the owner of a treasure he must conceal and defend.Living in the mine, and wandering about day and night, he perceived that you had discovered the secret, and had written in all haste to beg me to come.Hence the letter contradicting yours; hence, after my arrival, all the accidents that occurred, such as the block of stone thrown at Harry, the broken ladder at the Yarrow shaft, the obstruction of the openings into the wall of the new cutting; hence, in short, our imprisonment, and then our deliverance, brought about by the kind assistance of Nell, who acted of course without the knowledge of this man Silfax, and contrary to his intentions.”"
"“你描述的这些事情与已经发生的一模一样，斯塔尔先生，”老西蒙又接着说道，“无论如何，这个老‘修道士’现在是彻底疯了！”","“You describe everything exactly as it must have happened, Mr. Starr,” returned old Simon.“The old ‘monk’ is mad enough now, at any rate!”"
"“是这样更好。”马奇说道。","“All the better,” quoth Madge."
"“我不这样认为，”斯塔尔摇着头说道，“这次是一种极其可怕的疯狂。”","“I don't know that,” said Starr, shaking his head; “it is a terrible sort of madness this.”"
"“啊！现在我明白了，他的每个想法一定都吓坏了可怜的小内尔，我也理解了她不能让自己去告发她的祖父。她与这位老人在一起的那些日子是多么悲惨啊！”","“Ah! now I understand that the very thought of him must have terrified poor little Nell, and also I see that she could not bear to denounce her grandfather.What a miserable time she must have had of it with the old man!”"
"“悲惨的复仇，”西蒙回答道，“他和他的猫头鹰一样野蛮。由此看来，那只鸟没有死。是它把我们的灯弄灭了，也是它差点把吊着哈里和内尔的绳索弄断了。”","“Miserable with a vengeance,” replied Simon, “between that savage and his owl, as savage as himself.Depend upon it, that bird isn't dead.That was what put our lamp out, and also so nearly cut the rope by which Harry and Nell were suspended.”"
"“现在，你瞧，”马奇说道，“我们儿子和他孙女结婚的消息增强了他的怨恨和敌意。”","“And then, you see,” said Madge, “this news of the marriage of our son with his granddaughter added to his rancor and ill-will.”"
"“肯定是，”西蒙说道，“想到他的内尔要嫁给偷他煤矿的其中一人就会使他发狂。”","“To be sure,” said Simon.“To think that his Nell should marry one of the robbers of his own coal mine would just drive him wild altogether.”"
"“但是，对这事他必须要做出决断。”哈里叫道，“他是疯子，我们要设法说服他，内尔和我们住在这儿要比住在矿井里的洞穴好得多。我确信，斯塔尔先生，只要我们能抓住他，我们就可以跟他讲道理。”","“He will have to make up his mind to it, however,” cried Harry.“Mad as he is, we shall manage to convince him that Nell is better off with us here than ever she was in the caverns of the pit.I am sure, Mr. Starr, if we could only catch him, we should be able to make him listen to reason.”"
"“我可怜的哈里！和疯子没有道理可讲，”工程师回答道，“当然，知道你的敌人总比不知道要好；但不要仅仅因为我们发现了这人是谁，就指望一切都会好起来。我们必须保持警惕，朋友们；首先哈里必须要询问内尔。她会认识到她的沉默再也不合理了。就算是为了她祖父的利益，她现在也应该讲出来。为了他好，也是为了我们好，这些疯狂的阴谋必须结束了。”","“My poor Harry! there is no reasoning with a madman,” replied the engineer.“Of course it is better to know your enemy than not; but you must not fancy all is right because we have found out who he is.We must be on our guard, my friends; and to begin with, Harry, you positively must question Nell.She will perceive that her silence is no longer reasonable.Even for her grandfather’s own interest, she ought to speak now.For his own sake, as well as for ours, these insane plots must be put a stop to.”"
"“我相信，斯塔尔先生，”哈里回答道，“内尔会自己告诉您她所知道的事情的。您知道她是出于责任才至今都保持沉默。我母亲刚刚很明智地带她去了她的房间。她一定需要时间恢复精力，但现在我去找她。”","“I feel sure, Mr. Starr,” answered Harry, “that Nell will of herself propose to tell you what she knows.You see it was from a sense of duty that she has been silent hitherto.My mother was very right to take her to her room just now.She much needed time to recover her spirits; but now I will go for her.”"
"“你不用这么做，哈里。”少女用清晰而坚定的声音说道，这时她来到了他们所在的房间里。内尔苍白无力，眼里还有泪痕，但是她的行为表明她已下定决心，既要听从她忠诚的心也要履行她的职责。","“You need not do so, Harry,” said the maiden in a clear and firm voice, as she entered at that moment the room in which they were.Nell was very pale; traces of tears were in her eyes; but her whole manner showed that she had nerved herself to act as her loyal heart dictated as her duty."
"“内尔！”哈里喊道，向她走去。","“Nell!” cried Harry, springing towards her."
"女孩做了个手势挡示意她的爱人停下，继续说道，“你的父亲、母亲和你，哈里，现在必须知道一切。还有您，斯塔尔先生，你们理应了解你们收养的这个孩子的一切，还有把她从深井里救出来的哈里——唉，这对他来说是不幸了。”","The girl arrested her lover by a gesture, and continued, “Your father and mother, and you, Harry, must now know all.And you too, Mr. Starr, must remain ignorant of nothing that concerns the child you have received, and whom Harry—unfortunately for him, alas!—drew from the abyss.”"
"“噢，内尔！你在说什么呢？”哈里叫道。","“Oh, Nell! what are you saying?” cried Harry."
"“让她说。”詹姆斯·斯塔尔用坚定地口吻说道。","“Allow her to speak,” said James Starr in a decided tone."
"“我是老西尔法克斯的孙女，”内尔继续说道，“在我来到这里之前我从不知道母亲意味着什么。”她望着马奇补充道。","“I am the granddaughter of old Silfax,” resumed Nell.“I never knew a mother till the day I came here,” added she, looking at Madge."
"“感谢有那一天，我的女儿！”老妇人说道。","“Blessed be that day, my daughter!” said the old woman."
"“在遇到西蒙·福特之前我不知道父亲意味着什么，”她继续说道，“直到哈里的手碰到我的手那天我才知道朋友意味着什么。我和祖父孤独地在煤矿偏僻而最隐蔽的深洞里生活了十五年。我说和祖父生活在一起，但是我几乎不能用这种说法，因为我很少看到他。当他从老阿伯福伊尔消失时，他隐藏在只有他自己才知道的洞穴里。尽管他很可怕，但他用他的方式对我好；他用在煤矿外面找到的东西喂养我；我依稀记得在我很小的时候有只山羊喂养过我，它的死让我很悲伤。祖父看我很悲伤，就找了另外的动物来——他说是条狗。但是不幸的是，那条狗很活泼，喜欢叫。祖父不喜欢任何欢快的东西。他害怕声音，并教我要沉默；但他无法让狗学会安静，所以这只可怜的动物马上就消失了。祖父的同伴是只凶猛的鸟哈弗昂。起初，我很害怕它；尽管我不喜欢它，但这个生物对我却很有感情，我也情不自禁地回报它。比起它的主人它甚至更听我的话，这让我很不安，因为祖父很嫉妒。哈弗昂和我不敢让他看见我们经常在一起，我们都知道那会很危险。但是，我自己的事情讲得太多了，重要的是说说你们。”","I knew no father till I saw Simon Ford,” continued Nell; “nor friend till the day when Harry’s hand touched mine.Alone with my grandfather I have lived during fifteen years in the remote and most solitary depths of the mine.I say with my grandfather, but I can scarcely use the expression, for I seldom saw him.When he disappeared from Old Aberfoyle, he concealed himself in caverns known only to himself.In his way he was kind to me, dreadful as he was; he fed me with whatever he could procure from outside the mine; but I can dimly recollect that in my earliest years I was the nursling of a goat, the death of which was a bitter grief to me.My grandfather, seeing my distress, brought me another animal—a dog he said it was.But, unluckily, this dog was lively, and barked.Grandfather did not like anything cheerful.He had a horror of noise, and had taught me to be silent; the dog he could not teach to be quiet, so the poor animal very soon disappeared.My grandfather’s companion was a ferocious bird, Harfang, of which, at first, I had a perfect horror; but this creature, in spite of my dislike to it, took such a strong affection for me, that I could not help returning it.It even obeyed me better than its master, which used to make me quite uneasy, for my grandfather was jealous.Harfang and I did not dare to let him see us much together; we both knew it would be dangerous.But I am talking too much about myself: the great thing is about you.”"
"“不，我的孩子，”詹姆斯·斯塔尔说道，“告诉我们你脑中出现的所有事情。”","“No, my child,” said James Starr, “tell us everything that comes to your mind.”"
"“我的祖父，”内尔继续说道，“总是用邪恶的眼睛看着你们在煤矿的住所——可这里并不缺乏空间。他自己选择的庇护所很远——离你们非常远。但是感觉到你们在那里，这让他受不了。如果我问起任何关于住在我们上面的人的问题，他就会沉下脸来不回答，之后很长时间都沉默不语。但是当他发觉你们不满足于旧领地，似乎打算侵犯他的领地时，他就暴怒了。他发誓，如果你们成功到达了新煤矿，你们都得死。虽然他很老了，但是力气惊人，他的威胁总是让我发抖。”","“My grandfather,” continued Nell, “always regarded your abode in the mine with a very evil eye—not that there was any lack of space.His chosen refuge was far—very far from you.But he could not bear to feel that you were there.If I asked any questions about the people up above us, his face grew dark, he gave no answer, and continued quite silent for a long time afterwards.But when he perceived that, not content with the old domain, you seemed to think of encroaching upon his, then indeed his anger burst forth.He swore that, were you to succeed in reaching the new mine, you should assuredly perish.Notwithstanding his great age, his strength is astonishing, and his threats used to make me tremble.”"
"“继续说，内尔，我的孩子。”西蒙对女孩说道，这时女孩停了下来，似乎是在回忆。","“Go on, Nell, my child,” said Simon to the girl, who paused as though to collect her thoughts."
"“当你们第一次行动的时候，”内尔继续说道，“我祖父一看到你们已在通往新阿伯福伊尔的通道里，他就堵住了出口，并使这个通道变成了你们的牢狱。在矿井的一片黑暗中，我只是模糊地看到了你们的影子，但是想到你们都会饿死在这个可怕的地方，我就受不了，所以，我冒着被发现的危险，在那些天我成功地找到些面包和水给你们。我本来是打算帮助你们逃走的，但是要躲过祖父的警戒实在是太难了。你们就要死了。这时杰克·瑞安和其他人来了。多谢上帝我遇到了他们，我立刻把他们引到了你们那里。当祖父发现我的所作所为后，他的愤怒让人恐惧。我想着我是要死在他手里了。自那以后，我的生活变得不堪忍受。祖父已完全失去了理智。他宣称自己是黑暗和火的国王；每当他听到你们的工具在开采他完全认为是他自己的煤床时，他就会暴怒并残酷地打我。我本要逃走，但是这不可能，他盯我盯得很紧。最后，在一阵无法控制的暴怒之后，他把我扔到了你们发现我的那个深井里，在召唤哈弗昂跟他走无果后他就消失了，当时哈弗昂忠实地陪伴着我。我不知道在那里呆了多久，但我觉得就要死的时候，你，我的哈里，来了并救了我。但是现在你们都看到了，老西尔法克斯的孙女永远不能成为哈里·福特的妻子，因为这样的话你们所有人都会死！”","“On the occasion of your first attempt,” resumed Nell, “as soon as my grandfather saw that you were fairly inside the gallery leading to New Aberfoyle, he stopped up the opening, and turned it into a prison for you.I only knew you as shadows dimly seen in the gloom of the pit, but I could not endure the idea that you would die of hunger in these horrid places; and so, at the risk of being detected, I succeeded in obtaining bread and water for you during some days.I should have liked to help you to escape, but it was so difficult to avoid the vigilance of my grandfather.You were about to die.Then arrived Jack Ryan and the others.By the providence of God I met with them, and instantly guided them to where you were.When my grandfather discovered what I had done, his rage against me was terrible.I expected death at his hands.After that my life became insupportable to me.My grandfather completely lost his senses.He proclaimed himself King of Darkness and Flame; and when he heard your tools at work on coal-beds which he considered entirely his own, he became furious and beat me cruelly.I would have fled from him, but it was impossible, so narrowly did he watch me.At last, in a fit of ungovernable fury, he threw me down into the abyss where you found me, and disappeared, vainly calling on Harfang, which faithfully stayed by me, to follow him.I know not how long I remained there, but I felt I was at the point of death when you, my Harry, came and saved me.But now you all see that the grandchild of old Silfax can never be the wife of Harry Ford, because it would be certain death to you all!”"
"“内尔！”哈里喊道。","“Nell!” cried Harry."
"“不，”少女继续说道，“我已经决定了。只有一个办法能拯救你们，那就是我必须回到祖父身边。他威胁要毁掉整个新阿伯福伊尔。他不是一个有慈悲心和宽容心的人，没人能知道复仇的念头会让他做出什么可怕的行为。我的职责很明确；要是我迟疑不决不去实行，那我就是世界上最可鄙的人。再见了！我衷心感谢你们。你们告诉了我什么是幸福。无论发生什么，请相信我的整颗心和你们在一起。”","“No,” continued the maiden, “my resolution is taken.By one means only can your ruin be averted; I must return to my grandfather.He threatens to destroy the whole of New Aberfoyle.His is a soul incapable of mercy or forgiveness, and no mortal can say to what horrid deed the spirit of revenge will lead him.My duty is clear; I should be the most despicable creature on earth did I hesitate to perform it.Farewell!I thank you all heartily.You only have taught me what happiness is.Whatever may befall, believe that my whole heart remains with you.”"
"听了这些话，西蒙、马奇和哈里怀着悲痛的心情站了起来，用绝望的声音喊道，“什么，内尔！你有可能离开我们？”","At these words, Simon, Madge, and Harry started up in an agony of grief, exclaiming in tones of despair, “What, Nell! is it possible you would leave us?”"
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔用权威的神情将他们分开。他径直走向内尔，握住她的两只手，轻轻说道，“很好，我的孩子，你说了你应该说的那些话，现在听听我们的回答。我们不会让你走；如果有必要的话，我们会用武力让你留下来。你以为我们会如此卑鄙地接受你真诚的提议吗？西尔法克斯的危险是难以对付的——这不用怀疑！但是，毕竟，一个人就只是一个人，而且我们可以防备。就算是为了他好，你愿不愿意尽你所能告诉我们他的习惯和藏身之处？我们想要做的只是阻止他行恶，也许可以帮他恢复理智。”","James Starr put them all aside with an air of authority, and, going straight up to Nell, he took both her hands in his, saying quietly, “Very right, my child; you have said exactly what you ought to say; and now listen to what we have to say in reply.We shall not let you go away; if necessary, we shall keep you by force.Do you think we could be so base as to accept of your generous proposal?These threats of Silfax are formidable—no doubt about it!But, after all, a man is but a man, and we can take precautions.You will tell us, will you not, even for his own sake, all you can about his habits and his lurking-places?All we want to do is to put it out of his power to do harm, and perhaps bring him to reason.”"
"“您想要做的是不可能的事情，”内尔说道，“我祖父无处不在又处处不在。我从来没见过他的藏身之处。我从来没见过他睡觉。如果他想把自己藏起来，他就常常把我单独留下，然后消失了。当我下定决心的时候，斯塔尔先生，我就料到了你们会说什么来反对。相信我，除了让我回到西尔法克斯身边，没有任何其他办法能挫败他。他是隐形的，他可以看到正在发生的一切。如果他没有洞察一切的超凡能力，想想这一切是否有可能发生：他能发现你们的一切想法和意图，从给斯塔尔先生写信那时起，到现在我和哈里准备婚礼。据我判断，我祖父，就算极度疯狂，也是个非常有头脑的人。他从前常常跟我谈起那些非常高尚的话题。他告诉我上帝的存在，他从未欺骗过我，只有一点除外，那就是他让我相信所有人都是可鄙和不忠实的，因为他希望以他自己对所有人类的憎恨来激发我。当哈里带我回村舍时，你们以为我只是对人类无知，但是，远远不止那样，我非常害怕你们所有的人。啊，原谅我！我向你们保证，那些天我相信自己是被邪恶的人控制了，我一直都在想着逃走。您，马奇，第一次引导我懂得了道理，不是通过您所说的，而是看到了您每天的生活，我看到您的丈夫和儿子爱您敬您！之后又看到了那些善良而快乐的矿工们，他们是那么尊敬和信任斯塔尔先生，我以前还以为他们是奴隶；然后，第一次，我看到了阿伯福伊尔所有的人来到教堂并跪下向上帝祈祷，赞美上帝的无限恩惠，我对自己说，‘祖父欺骗了我。’","“You want to do what is quite impossible,” said Nell.“My grandfather is everywhere and nowhere.I have never seen his retreats.I have never seen him sleep.If he meant to conceal himself, he used to leave me alone, and vanish.When I took my resolution, Mr. Starr, I was aware of everything you could say against it.Believe me, there is but one way to render Silfax powerless, and that will be by my return to him.Invisible himself, he sees everything that goes on.Just think whether it is likely he could discover your very thoughts and intentions, from that time when the letter was written to Mr. Starr, up to now that my marriage with Harry has been arranged, if he did not possess the extraordinary faculty of knowing everything.As far as I am able to judge, my grandfather, in his very insanity, is a man of most powerful mind.He formerly used to talk to me on very lofty subjects.He taught me the existence of God, and never deceived me but on one point, which was—that he made me believe that all men were base and perfidious, because he wished to inspire me with his own hatred of all the human race.When Harry brought me to the cottage, you thought I was simply ignorant of mankind, but, far beyond that, I was in mortal fear of you all.Ah, forgive me!I assure you, for many days I believed myself in the power of wicked wretches, and I longed to escape.You, Madge, first led me to perceive the truth, not by anything you said, but by the sight of your daily life, for I saw that your husband and son loved and respected you!Then all these good and happy workmen, who so revere and trust Mr. Starr, I used to think they were slaves; and when, for the first time, I saw the whole population of Aberfoyle come to church and kneel down to pray to God, and praise Him for His infinite goodness, I said to myself, ‘my grandfather has deceived me.’"
"但是现在，你们告诉我的一切启发了我，我更愿意认为他是在自欺欺人。我打算回到从前常常陪他走的秘密通道里。他肯定在监视着。我会叫他；他会听到我，但谁知道我回到他身边去后，有没有可能把他带到现实中呢？”"," But now, enlightened by all you have taught me, I am inclined to think he himself is deceived.I mean to return to the secret passages I formerly frequented with him.He is certain to be on the watch.I will call to him; he will hear me, and who knows but that, by returning to him, I may be able to bring him to the knowledge of the truth?”"
"没有人打断少女的讲述，因为所有人都觉得让她向朋友们敞开心扉对她有益。","The maiden spoke without interruption, for all felt that it was good for her to open her whole heart to her friends."
"但她因为激动而精疲力尽，眼里充满了泪水，她停止了说话，这时哈里转向老马奇说道，“母亲，您会怎样看待那个抛弃那个您一直在听她说话的高尚女孩的人？”","But when, exhausted by emotion, and with eyes full of tears, she ceased speaking, Harry turned to old Madge and said, “Mother, what should you think of the man who could forsake the noble girl whose words you have been listening to?”"
"“我会认为他是个可鄙的懦夫，”马奇说道，“并且，要是他是我的儿子，我会抛弃并咒骂他。”","“I should think he was a base coward,” said Madge, “and, were he my son, I should renounce and curse him.”"
"“内尔，你听到我们的母亲说的话了吗？”哈里继续说道，“不管你去哪里我都会跟着你。如果你坚持要离开我们，我们一起离开。”","“Nell, do you hear what our mother says?” resumed Harry.“Wherever you go I will follow you.If you persist in leaving us, we will go away together.”"
"“哈里！哈里！”内尔喊道。"," “Harry!Harry!” cried Nell."
"强烈的感情使女孩的嘴唇变白了，她倒在马奇的怀里。马奇请求和她单独呆在一起。","Overcome by her feelings, the girl’s lips blanched, and she sank into the arms of Madge, who begged she might be left alone with her."
"第十八章 内尔的婚礼","CHAPTER XVIII NELL’s WEDDING"
"人们一致同意村舍里的居民必须要保持前所未有的警惕。老西尔法克斯的威胁非同小可，不容忽视。也很有可能是他掌握了一些足以毁掉整个阿伯福伊尔的可怕方法。","It was agreed that the inhabitants of the cottage must keep more on their guard than ever.The threats of old Silfax were too serious to be disregarded.It was only too possible that he possessed some terrible means by which the whole of Aberfoyle might be annihilated."
"武装好的哨兵在通往煤矿的各个入口守卫着，他们奉命日夜严加看守。任何进入煤矿的陌生人都被带到了詹姆斯·斯塔尔面前，以便他们能交代自己是谁。不用担心煤城的居民会不忠，他们已经知道了对地下聚居区的威胁。内尔被告知了要采取的所有措施，她变得更加平静，尽管她还没有完全摆脱不安。哈里决定她走到哪里他就跟到哪里，这迫使她承诺不会逃离她的朋友们。","Armed sentinels were posted at the various entrances to the mine, with orders to keep strict watch day and night.Any stranger entering the mine was brought before James Starr, that he might give an account of himself.There being no fear of treason among the inhabitants of Coal Town, the threatened danger to the subterranean colony was made known to them.Nell was informed of all the precautions taken, and became more tranquil, although she was not free from uneasiness.Harry’s determination to follow her wherever she went compelled her to promise not to escape from her friends."
"婚礼前一个星期，阿伯福伊尔什么事故也没有发生。监督系统严密维持着，矿工们已从曾严重影响开采工作的惊慌中恢复过来。詹姆斯·斯塔尔继续留心西尔法克斯。老头已经报复性地宣称内尔决不能和西蒙的儿子结婚。有理由猜测，他会毫不犹豫地实施破坏他们结合的暴行。","During the week preceding the wedding, no accident whatever occurred in Aberfoyle.The system of watching was carefully maintained, but the miners began to recover from the panic, which had seriously interrupted the work of excavation.James Starr continued to look out for Silfax.The old man having vindictively declared that Nell should never marry Simon’s son. It was natural to suppose that he would not hesitate to commit any violent deed which would hinder their union."
"对煤矿的检查在周密地进行着。每一条通道和水平巷道都搜寻过了，一直到了邓唐纳德城堡废墟入口的高层。有理由猜测，西尔法克斯穿过这个旧建筑物去寻找维持他可怜生活的必需品（他肯定这样做过，不是买就是偷）。","The examination of the mine was carried on minutely.Every passage and gallery was searched, up to those higher ranges which opened out among the ruins of Dundonald Castle.It was rightly supposed that through this old building Silfax passed out to obtain what was needful for the support of his miserable existence (which he must have done, either by purchasing or thieving)."
"至于“火焰少女”的出现，詹姆斯·斯塔尔开始认为，肯定是由于该处矿井喷出的某股甲烷气流被西尔法克斯点燃造成的。他说的大致没错，但是没有找到任何证据，并且，永无休止地寻找这个恶毒而隐形的人让工程师一直紧绷着神经，使他——虽然外表镇静——感到不快乐。","As to the “fire-maidens,” James Starr began to think that appearance must have been produced by some jet of fire-damp gas which, issuing from that part of the pit, could be lighted by Silfax.He was not far wrong; but all search for proof of this was fruitless, and the continued strain of anxiety in this perpetual effort to detect a malignant and invisible being rendered the engineer—outwardly calm—an unhappy man."
"随着婚期的临近，他关于某些灾难的担心在增长，他只能将之告诉老工头，老工头马上变得比他还要不安。最终这一天来了。西尔法克斯还是没有出现的迹象。","As the wedding-day approached, his dread of some catastrophe increased, and he could not but speak of it to the old overman, whose uneasiness soon more than equaled his own.At length the day came.Silfax had given no token of existence."
"一到黎明煤城所有的人就起床了。工作都停了下来；监工们和矿工们都一样渴望向西蒙·福特和他儿子表达敬意。他们都觉得要非常感谢这些大胆而坚毅的人，正是有了他们的办法，煤矿才恢复了以前的繁荣。十一点时，结婚典礼将在矗立于马尔科姆湖畔的圣贾尔斯教堂举行。","By daybreak the entire population of Coal Town was astir.Work was suspended; overseers and workmen alike desired to do honor to Simon Ford and his son.They all felt they owed a large debt of gratitude to these bold and persevering men, by whose means the mine had been restored to its former prosperity.The ceremony was to take place at eleven o'clock, in St. Giles’s chapel, which stood on the shores of Loch Malcolm."
"到了约定的时间，哈里离开了村舍，挽着母亲的胳膊，而西蒙引领着新娘。接着出来的是表面沉着但实际上已做了最坏打算的工程师斯塔尔，以及身着高地吹笛人服饰的杰克·瑞安。随后是其他的采矿工程师们、煤城的重要人物、老工头的朋友和同伴——新阿伯福伊尔每一个矿工大家族的成员。","At the appointed time, Harry left the cottage, supporting his mother on his arm, while Simon led the bride.Following them came Starr, the engineer, composed in manner, but in reality nerved to expect the worst, and Jack Ryan, stepping superb in full Highland piper’s costume.Then came the other mining engineers, the principal people of Coal Town, the friends and comrades of the old overman—every member of this great family of miners forming the population of New Aberfoyle."
"在外面的世界，这是最热的八月的一天，尤其是在北方地区，闷热难挡。闷热的空气渗入煤矿深处，温度也升高了。穿过通风井和马尔科姆湖大隧道的空气都带着电，气压计的数值也降得很低，当然，这是事后察觉到的。的确，种种迹象表明，在形成这个巨大煤矿地下城顶部的岩石拱顶下会有风暴发生。","In the outer world, the day was one of the hottest of the month of August, peculiarly oppressive in northern countries.The sultry air penetrated the depths of the coal mine, and elevated the temperature.The air which entered through the ventilating shafts, and the great tunnel of Loch Malcolm, was charged with electricity, and the barometer, it was afterwards remarked, had fallen in a remarkable manner.There was, indeed, every indication that a storm might burst forth beneath the rocky vault which formed the roof of the enormous crypt of the very mine itself."
"但是那时候，居民们没有费力去想地面大气干扰的可能性。每个人理所当然地为这个场合穿上了最好的衣服。马奇穿着一件旧款的衣服，头戴“玩具”头饰，肩上披着“罗克莱”，这是旧时主妇们戴的一种方格头巾。老西蒙穿着一件外套，就是贝利·尼科尔·贾维本人也会同意他穿的。","But the inhabitants were not at that moment troubling themselves about the chances of atmospheric disturbance above ground.Everybody, as a matter of course, had put on his best clothes for the occasion.Madge was dressed in the fashion of days gone by, wearing the “toy” and the “rokelay,” or Tartan plaid, of matrons of the olden time, old Simon wore a coat of which Bailie Nicol Jarvie himself would have approved."
"内尔下定决心不表现出任何内心的不安，她强忍着心跳，否则内心的恐惧就会流露出来；这个勇敢的女孩在人前都是一副冷静镇定的样子。她拒绝了裙子所有的装饰，简洁的礼服更增添了她迷人的风采。她的头发用“发网”束起，这是苏格兰少女常用的头饰。","Nell had resolved to show nothing of her mental agitation; she forbade her heart to beat, or her inward terrors to betray themselves, and the brave girl appeared before all with a calm and collected aspect.She had declined every ornament of dress, and the very simplicity of her attire added to the charming elegance of her appearance.Her hair was bound with the “snood,” the usual head-dress of Scottish maidens."
"所有人都走向圣贾尔斯教堂，这里为了这一场面已经装饰一新。","All proceeded towards St. Giles’s chapel, which had been handsomely decorated for the occasion."
"照亮煤城的电盘闪闪发亮，像有很多太阳一样。新阿伯福伊尔一片灯火辉煌。教堂里，电灯照着彩绘玻璃窗，像火一般的万花筒闪耀着。在教堂的门廊处牧师在等待婚礼的临近。","The electric discs of light which illuminated Coal Town blazed like so many suns.A luminous atmosphere pervaded New Aberfoyle.In the chapel, electric lamps shed a glow over the stained-glass windows, which shone like fiery kaleidoscopes.At the porch of the chapel the minister awaited the arrival of the wedding party."
"庄严的队伍经过马尔科姆湖岸后越来越近了。这时风琴拉响了，牧师在前领路，队伍走进了教堂。首先祈求神灵的祝福降临于所有在场的人。然后，哈里和内尔留下站在牧师面前，牧师手捧圣经，继续说道，“哈里，你愿意内尔成为你的妻子并发誓永远爱她吗？”","It approached, after having passed in stately procession along the shore of Loch Malcolm.Then the tones of the organ were heard, and, preceded by the minister, the group advanced into the chapel.The Divine blessing was first invoked on all present.Then Harry and Nell remained alone before the minister, who, holding the sacred book in his hand, proceeded to say, “Harry, will you take Nell to be your wife, and will you promise to love her always?”"
"“我愿意。”这个年轻人用坚定而稳重的声音答道。","“I promise,” answered the young man in a firm and steady voice."
"“你呢，内尔，”牧师继续说道，“你愿意让哈里成为你的丈夫，并且——”","“And you, Nell,” continued the minister, “will you take Harry to be your husband, and—”"
"他还没说完这句话，便传来了一声巨响。马尔科姆湖岸上方平台下面的一块巨大悬岩没有爆炸就突然倒塌断裂了，露出一个巨大的深渊，水猛地涌了进去。","Before he could finish the sentence, a prodigious noise resounded from without.One of the enormous rocks, on which was formed the terrace overhanging the banks of Loch Malcolm, had suddenly given way and opened without explosion, disclosing a profound abyss, into which the waters were now wildly plunging."
"接着，在破碎的石头和奔腾的浪涛中出现了一条独木舟，一股猛烈的力量把它抛到湖面上。人们看见一位老人笔直地站在独木舟里。他穿着一件黑色的披风，头发蓬乱，长长的花白胡子垂到胸前，手持一盏戴维安全灯，灯上的金属丝网保护着火苗。","In another instant, among the shattered rocks and rushing waves appeared a canoe, which a vigorous arm propelled along the surface of the lake.In the canoe was seen the figure of an old man standing upright.He was clothed in a dark mantle, his hair was dishevelled, a long white beard fell over his breast, and in his hand he bore a lighted Davy safety lamp, the flame being protected by the metallic gauze of the apparatus."
"老头大声喊道，“甲烷是给你们的！灾难——灾难降临到你们所有人身上！”","In a loud voice this old man shouted, “The fire-damp is upon you!Woe—woe betide ye all!”"
"就在这时，人们察觉到一股淡淡的碳化氢独有的气味在空气中弥漫开来。事实上，巨石的倒塌给聚集在巨大洞穴里的大量爆炸性气体让出了一条通道，之前它们被堵住了。","At the same moment the slight smell peculiar to carburetted hydrogen was perceptibly diffused through the atmosphere.And, in truth, the fall of the rock had made a passage of escape for an enormous quantity of explosive gas, accumulated in vast cavities, the openings to which had hitherto been blocked up."
"甲烷气流向上冲到拱形穹顶；这凶恶的老头非常清楚，他这样做的后果是让整个煤矿的空气具有爆炸性。","Jets and streams of the fire-damp now rose upward in the vaulted dome; and well did that fierce old man know that the consequence of what he had done would be to render explosive the whole atmosphere of the mine."
"詹姆斯·斯塔尔和其余的人迅速离开教堂，看到情况危急，现在又冲回来，用最大的声音喊道，“逃出煤矿！立即逃出煤矿！”","James Starr and several others, having hastily quitted the chapel, and perceived the imminence of the danger, now rushed back, crying out in accents of the utmost alarm, “Fly from the mine!Fly instantly from the mine!”"
"“现在甲烷出现了！甲烷来了！”老头大叫道，让独木舟靠湖边更近些。","“Now for the fire-damp!Here comes the fire-damp!” yelled the old man, urging his canoe further along the lake."
"哈里和他的新娘、父亲及母亲，在恐惧匆忙中离开了教堂。","Harry with his bride, his father and his mother, left the chapel in haste and in terror."
"“逃吧！逃命吧！”詹姆斯·斯塔尔重复着。唉！要逃走太迟了！老西尔法克斯站在那里，准备实施他最后的可怕威胁行动——准备把所有的人埋在煤矿的废墟下，以此来阻止内尔和哈里的婚礼。","“Fly! fly for your lives!” repeated James Starr.Alas! it was too late to fly!Old Silfax stood there, prepared to fulfill his last dreadful threat—prepared to stop the marriage of Nell and Harry by overwhelming the entire population of the place beneath the ruins of the coal mine."
"当他准备实施他的这个报复行为时，他的那只白色羽毛上沾满黑色污点的大猫头鹰正在他的头顶盘旋。","As he stood ready to accomplish this act of vengeance, his enormous owl, whose white plumage was marked with black spots, was seen hovering directly above his head."
"就在这时，一个男人纵身跳入湖水中，用力游向那只独木舟。","At that moment a man flung himself into the waters of the lake, and swam vigorously towards the canoe."
"那是杰克·瑞安，他下定决心要在这个疯子做出可怕的毁灭行动前游到那里。","It was Jack Ryan, fully determined to reach the madman before he could do the dreadful deed of destruction."
"西尔法克斯看到他来了。他立即就打碎了灯玻璃，扯出烧着的灯芯，并在空气中挥舞着。","Silfax saw him coming.Instantly he smashed the glass of his lamp, and, snatching out the burning wick, waved it in the air."
"人们吓呆了，死一般地寂静。詹姆斯·斯塔尔有一种绝望的平静，他对不可避免的爆炸居然片刻之后才感到惊讶。","Silence like death fell upon the astounded multitude.James Starr, in the calmness of despair, marvelled that the inevitable explosion was even for a moment delayed."
"西尔法克斯抬头凝视，面容狰狞扭曲，似乎意识到了这气体比下面的大气轻一些，它们都积聚到了高处穹顶的下边；这时猫头鹰看到了他的手势，用它的爪子抓住烧着的灯芯，朝着疯老头用伸长的手臂指向的拱顶飞去。","Silfax, gazing upwards with wild and contracted features, appeared to become aware that the gas, lighter than the lower atmosphere, was accumulating far up under the dome; and at a sign from him the owl, seizing in its claw the lighted match, soared upwards to the vaulted roof, towards which the madman pointed with outstretched arm."
"再过一秒新阿伯福伊尔就不存在了。","Another second and New Aberfoyle would be no more."
"突然，内尔挣脱了哈里的胳膊，一副大受启发的表情，跑到了湖水的边缘处。“哈弗昂！哈弗昂！”她用清晰的声音叫道，“这里！来我这里！”","Suddenly Nell sprang from Harry’s arms, and, with a bright look of inspiration, she ran to the very brink of the waters of the lake.“Harfang!Harfang!” cried she in a clear voice; “here! come to me!”"
"这只忠诚的鸟吃了一惊，似乎在飞翔时犹豫了一下。马上，它听出了内尔的声音，把烧着的灯芯扔到水里，接着飞出一个大圈，向下扑到少女的脚边。","The faithful bird, surprised, appeared to hesitate in its flight.Presently, recognizing Nell’s voice, it dropped the burning match into the water, and, describing a wide circle, flew downwards, alighting at the maiden’s feet."
"这时一声可怕的呼喊在拱顶下回荡。这是老西尔法克斯发出的最后一声。","Then a terrible cry echoed through the vaulted roofs.It was the last sound uttered by old Silfax."
"就在杰克·瑞安的手刚碰到小舟的边缘时，这个老头，由于复仇受挫，一头栽进湖水里。","Just as Jack Ryan laid his hand on the edge of the canoe, the old man, foiled in his purpose of revenge, cast himself headlong into the waters of the lake."
"“救他！噢，救他！”内尔痛苦地尖叫着。哈里立即就跳入水中，游向杰克·瑞安，并潜了几次水。","“Save him! oh, save him!” shrieked Nell in a voice of agony.Immediately Harry plunged into the water, and, swimming towards Jack Ryan, he dived repeatedly."
"但是他的努力白费了。马尔科姆湖水不会让出它们的猎物：它们永远扣下了西尔法克斯。","But his efforts were useless.The waters of Loch Malcolm yielded not their prey: they closed forever over Silfax."
"第十九章 老西尔法克斯的传说","CHAPTER XIX THE LEGEND OF OLD SILFAX"
"这些事发生六个月后，被不可思议地中止的婚礼最后在圣贾尔斯教堂举行，这对仍然穿着丧服的年轻夫妇返回了村舍。詹姆斯·斯塔尔和西蒙·福特从那以后摆脱了长期困扰他们的忧虑，他们快乐地主持了婚礼后的娱乐活动，并持续了两天。","Six months after these events, the marriage, so strangely interrupted, was finally celebrated in St. Giles’s chapel, and the young couple, who still wore mourning garments, returned to the cottage.James Starr and Simon Ford, henceforth free from the anxieties which had so long distressed them, joyously presided over the entertainment which followed the ceremony, and prolonged it to the following day."
"在这一值得纪念的时刻，杰克·瑞安出演了他最喜欢的风笛手的角色，他盛装出席，吹起了他的风笛管，并且他那闻所未闻的弹、唱、跳结合的效果令众人大吃一惊。","On this memorable occasion, Jack Ryan, in his favorite character of piper, and in all the glory of full dress, blew up his chanter, and astonished the company by the unheard of achievement of playing, singing, and dancing all at once."
"不必说，哈里和内尔是幸福的。这两颗相爱的心，在经受那些考验后，在他们的结合中找到了应得的幸福。","It is needless to say that Harry and Nell were happy.These loving hearts, after the trials they had gone through found in their union the happiness they deserved."
"至于西蒙·福特，这位新阿伯福伊尔的前任工头，开始谈论和善良的老马奇结婚50周年的金婚庆典，马奇自己很喜欢这个主意。","As to Simon Ford, the ex-overman of New Aberfoyle, he began to talk of celebrating his golden wedding, after fifty years of marriage with good old Madge, who liked the idea immensely herself."
"“之后，为什么不再来个金婚？","“And after that, why not golden wedding number two?”"
"您会喜欢好几个50周年的，是吧，西蒙先生？”杰克·瑞安说道。","“You would like a couple of fifties, would you, Mr. Simon?” said Jack Ryan."
"“好吧，我的孩子，”老工头安静地答道，“在我们这么宜人的气候下，远离外面世界的奢华和放纵，我看没什么能阻止它。”","“All right, my boy,” replied the overman quietly, “I see nothing against it in this fine climate of ours, and living far from the luxury and intemperance of the outer world.”"
"煤城的居民会被叫来见证这第二个庆典吗？时间会说明的。当然这只老西尔法克斯的怪鸟似乎命中注定会特别长寿。哈弗昂继续在洞穴的黑暗幽深处游荡。老人死后，内尔曾试图饲养这只猫头鹰，但是几天后他就飞走了。很明显他像他的主人一样不喜欢人类社会，除此之外，他似乎对哈里有股特别的怨恨。这只嫉妒的鸟似乎记得并且憎恨哈里，尽管它阻止过哈里，但哈里还是把内尔从深井里带了出来。然而，每隔很长一段时间，内尔还是会看到这家伙在马尔科姆湖上空盘旋。","Will the dwellers in Coal Town ever be called to witness this second ceremony?Time will show.Certainly the strange bird of old Silfax seemed destined to attain a wonderful longevity.The Harfang continued to haunt the gloomy recesses of the cave.After the old man’s death, Nell had attempted to keep the owl, but in a very few days he flew away.He evidently disliked human society as much as his master had done, and, besides that, he appeared to have a particular spite against Harry.The jealous bird seemed to remember and hate him for having carried off Nell from the deep abyss, notwithstanding all he could do to prevent him.Still, at long intervals, Nell would see the creature hovering above Loch Malcolm."
"他可能是在看他昔日的朋友吗？他是不是试图用他犀利的眼睛看穿这个吞没他主人的深渊呢？","Could he possibly be watching for his friend of yore?Did he strive to pierce, with keen eye, the depths which had engulfed his master?"
"哈弗昂的历史成为一个传奇，给杰克·瑞安提供了许多故事和歌谣。多亏了他，老西尔法克斯和他的鸟的故事才能长久保留下来，并传给了苏格兰农民的后代。","The history of the Harfang became legendary, and furnished Jack Ryan with many a tale and song.Thanks to him, the story of old Silfax and his bird will long be preserved, and handed down to future generations of the Scottish peasantry."
