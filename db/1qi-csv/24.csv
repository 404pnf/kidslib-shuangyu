"第一章 唯一的幸存者","CHAPTER I THERE IS NO ONE LEFT"
"玛丽·伦诺克斯被送到米瑟斯韦特庄园和她姑父一起生活。那里的每个人都说，从没见过如此别扭的小孩儿。不过，也确实如此。她小脸消瘦、身板单薄、头发稀疏，总是一脸不高兴的样子。她头发是黄色的，再加上出生在印度，且常常不是得这病就是生那病，脸色也是蜡黄的。她的爸爸曾在英国政府部门任职。他总是很忙碌，且自己身体也不大好；她妈妈以前可是个大美女，满脑子只想着参加各种宴会，于觥筹交错之间寻欢作乐。她本来一点儿也不打算要这个女孩儿。所以玛丽一出生，便把她交给印度奶妈照看。奶妈明白，要想讨女主人欢心，便得把这孩子带得越远越好。因此，当她还是个孱弱、暴躁、难看的小婴儿时，便被带离妈妈的视线；当她依旧体弱多病、暴躁易怒、开始蹒跚学步时，依旧生活在不妨碍大人的地方。印度奶妈和当地仆人的黑脸是她印象中唯一熟悉的事物。他们总是顺着她，对她有求必应。因为如果她的哭声吵到女主人的话，女主人会发火的。因此，她长到六岁的时候，已经变成了全世界最专横、最自私的孩子。曾有一个年轻的英国家庭女教师来教她读写。那老师很讨厌她，不到三个月就辞职不干了。后来有其他老师来应聘，但往往坚持得比第一个更短。因此，若不是玛丽自己着实喜爱读书，她恐怕到现在还一字不识呢。","When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen.It was true, too.She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression.Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible.So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also.She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one.So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all."
"大约在她九岁那年。一天早晨，天气奇热无比，她醒来便觉得有些烦躁。而当她看到站在自己床边的仆人不是印度奶妈时，心里就更加窝火了。","One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah."
"“怎么是你？”她冲着这个陌生女人大嚷，“我这里不要你。去把奶妈叫来。”","“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman.“I will not let you stay.Send my Ayah to me.”"
"这个女人看起来吓坏了，她只会结结巴巴地说奶妈不能过来。玛丽火气更大了，对她又踢又打。她看起来更加惊恐了，嘴里不断重复着说奶妈不能过来小姐这里。","The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib."
"那天早上气氛有些诡异。一切都有些异常。有几个土著仆人好像不见了，而那些玛丽看见的仆人们，也一个个面如死灰，神色惊恐地匆匆跑掉。没有人告诉她任何事情，她的奶妈也没有出现。那天早晨，后来就剩她独自一人了，最后她索性漫步到花园里，在游廊旁边的一棵树下自己玩了起来。她把一朵朵深红的木槿花插进小土堆，假装在修建花坛。她越堆越生气，嘴里不停地嘟囔着。她想，等印度奶妈回来后就用这些话骂她。","There was something mysterious in the air that morning.Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces.But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come.She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda.She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned."
"“猪！大笨猪！猪养的！”她骂着。对印度土著来说，这是最大的侮辱了。","“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all."
"她咬牙切齿地不停诅咒，忽然听到游廊那头妈妈和一个人走了出来。妈妈和一个长相俊俏的小伙子站在一起，他们用很低很奇怪的声音在说着什么。玛丽认识这个小伙子，他看起来像个小男孩儿。她听说他是个刚从英国来的年轻军官。玛丽瞪着他，同时更专注地盯着自己的母亲。她每次有机会见到自己的母亲都这么盯着她看。因为女主人——玛丽对自己妈妈最常用的称呼——总是美丽、苗条、高挑，衣着亮丽。她有着卷曲如丝缎般的头发、小巧精致的鼻子，仿佛看不起任何事情，还有一双大大的笑眼。她所有的衣服都轻薄飘逸，用玛丽的话说就是“满是蕾丝”。那天早上衣服上的蕾丝比以往更加丰满，只不过她的眼睛不再有笑意。她的大眼睛中充满恐慌，恳切的目光投在年轻军官漂亮的脸上。","She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one.She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy.She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England.The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother.She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes.Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes.All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were “full of lace.”They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer’s face."
"“情况有这么糟吗？这是真的吗？”玛丽听到她说。","“Is it so very bad?Oh, is it?”Mary heard her say."
"“糟透了，”年轻军官用颤抖的声音回答，“糟透了，伦诺克斯太太。你两周前就应该搬到山上去。”","“Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice.“Awfully, Mrs. Lennox.You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.”"
"女主人紧紧绞着双手。","The Mem Sahib wrung her hands."
"“哦，我是应该这样！”她叫喊着，“我留下来就是要参加那个该死的晚宴。我真是傻透了！”","“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried.“I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party.What a fool I was!”"
"就在这时，一阵响亮的嚎哭声从仆人宿舍传来。女主人一把抓住了年轻军官的手臂，而玛丽站在那里浑身发抖。嚎哭声越来越肆意。“那是什么声音？什么声音？”伦诺克斯太太倒抽了一口气。","At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants’ quarters that she clutched the young man’s arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot.The wailing grew wilder and wilder.“What is it?What is it?”Mrs. Lennox gasped."
"“有人死了。”年轻军官回答道，“你没有告诉我已经在仆人中爆发了。”","“Some one has died,” answered the boy officer.“You did not say it had broken out among your servants.”"
"“我不知道！”女主人哭喊道，“跟我来！跟我来！”她转身跑进了屋子。","“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried.“Come with me!Come with me!” and she turned and ran into the house."
"之后，可怕的事情发生了。玛丽终于明白了这个早晨异样的原因。一种最致命的霍乱爆发了，人们如蚊蝇一般死去。印度奶妈昨晚发病刚刚就死掉了。所以茅草屋中才传来那样的嚎哭声。不到一天，又死了三个仆人。剩下的人则惊慌失措地逃跑了。每个角落都充满恐惧，小平房里都是垂死之人。","After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary.The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies.The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts.Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror.There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows."
"到处一片混乱狼籍。第二天，玛丽躲进了自己的幼儿室，被人们遗忘了。没人想起她，没人找她，怪事发生了，她还浑然不觉。玛丽时哭时睡。她只知道有人生病了，还能听到神秘的，吓人的声音。她爬进餐厅，里面空无一人。桌子上的饭还没吃完，椅子和盘子被匆忙推开，仿佛正在用餐的人由于什么原因而突然起身离开了。玛丽吃了些水果和饼干，觉得口渴，便喝了杯中的酒。那杯子几乎是斟满的。酒甜甜的，她没意识到酒劲有多大。没多一会儿她便觉得困乏不堪。于是她回到幼儿室，又把自己关在里面。棚屋里传出的哭嚎声和急匆匆的脚步声令她感到害怕。酒劲很大，她困意涌来，甚至睁不开眼睛。她躺到床上，不一会儿便人事不知了。","During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone.Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing.Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours.She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds.Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled.It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was.Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet.The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time."
"外面发生了很多事情。但无论是痛哭声，还是东西被抬进抬出的动静，都丝毫无法惊动沉睡中的玛丽。","Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow."
"她醒来后便躺在床上，盯着墙出神。屋子里一片沉寂。她以前从未听到这房间如此安静过。听不到说话声，也没有脚步声。她想，人们是不是已经从霍乱中恢复，一切烦扰都已经过去了吧。她甚至开始考虑，她的印度奶妈死了，那以后谁来照料她呢。也许会有一个新奶妈吧，也会说些新的故事。她对那些旧故事已经着实厌倦了。她才不会因为自己的保姆死掉而哭泣。她从来就不是一个感情丰富的孩子，也从未真正关心过谁。她被霍乱带来的嘈杂、忙乱和嚎哭声吓坏了。她非常生气，因为好像大家都忘记了她还活着。恐慌之下的人们，自然无暇顾及一个不招待见的小女孩儿。霍乱来临之时，人们自然就只顾得上自己了。不过，如果一切都好起来了，自然会有人想起她，来找她的。","When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall.The house was perfectly still.She had never known it to be so silent before.She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over.She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead.There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new stories.Mary had been rather tired of the old ones.She did not cry because her nurse had died.She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one.The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive.Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of.When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves.But if everyone had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her."
"但是没有人来。她躺在那里等，屋子好像越来越安静了。她听到地毯上窸窣作响的声音，低头一看，是条小蛇爬过，它正用宝石般的眼睛看着自己。她并没有被吓到，因为那是一个无害的小东西，而且它好像也正急于离开这里。玛丽看着它从门缝下溜走。","But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent.She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels.She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room.He slipped under the door as she watched him."
"“这里多么古怪，多么安静啊。”她说道，“好像屋子里只有我和这条小蛇。”","“How queer and quiet it is,” she said.“It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.”"
"话音刚落，她便听到院子里响起了脚步声，接着到了游廊。这是男人们的脚步声。他们进了小屋，压低声音讲话。没有人起身迎接，也没人跟他们讲话。他们好像打开了一个个房间的门，朝里张望。“真是一片废墟！”她听到有个人说道，“那么个美人！我猜那个孩子也……我听说还有个女孩儿的，虽然没人见过。”","Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda.They were men’s footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.“What desolation!” she heard one voice say.“That pretty, pretty woman!I suppose the child, too.I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her.”"
"几分钟后，他们打开了幼儿室的门。玛丽就站在屋子中央。她看起来就是个丑丑的小东西。被忽视的屈辱感和咕咕作响的肚子更让她看起来火气很大，眉头都抽在了一起。第一个走进来的男人是一个高级军官，玛丽曾经看到他和爸爸谈话。他看上去疲惫不堪，看到玛丽时，惊讶得几乎后跳。","Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later.She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father.He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back."
"“巴尼！”他惊叫起来，“这儿有一个小孩儿。就她自己！在这破地方！上帝保佑，你是谁？”","“Barney!” he cried out.“There is a child here!A child alone!In a place like this!Mercy on us, who is she!”"
"“我是玛丽·伦诺克斯。”玛丽硬邦邦地站直身子。她觉得这个人很粗鲁，竟然把爸爸的小屋说成是“这破地方”。“大家感染霍乱的时候我睡着了，才刚刚醒来。怎么没有人来呢？”","“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.She thought the man was very rude to call her father’s bungalow “A place like this!”“I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up.Why does nobody come?”"
"这个男人对伙伴们惊呼道：“这就是那个没人见到过的孩子。她竟然被遗忘了。”","“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man, turning to his companions.“She has actually been forgotten!”"
"“为什么把我忘记了？”玛丽跺着脚问，“为什么没有人来？”","“Why was I forgotten?”Mary said, stamping her foot.“Why does nobody come?”"
"那个叫巴尼的年轻人用悲伤的眼神望着她。玛丽甚至觉得自己看到他为了忍住眼泪而拼命眨眼睛。","The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly.Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away."
"“可怜的小家伙！”他说，“没人会来了，都死了。”","“Poor little kid!” he said.“There is nobody left to come.”"
"玛丽就是在这样一种莫名其妙和措手不及的状况下得知自己已经失去了父母；他们已经死去，在夜里被抬走了，而那些为数不多的几个幸存的印度仆人，也都用最快的速度逃离了这所房子，还有谁会想起还有个玛丽小姐呢。难怪这里如此安静。因为这所房子就真的只有她自己和那条窸窣作响的小蛇了。","It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.That was why the place was so quiet.It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake."
"第二章 玛丽小姐，倔强异常","CHAPTER II MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY"
"虽然玛丽曾喜欢远远地看着自己漂亮的母亲，她却实在不了解她。因此，不能指望妈妈去世后玛丽能有多爱她，想念她。说实在的她一点儿都不想念她。玛丽是一个只顾自己的孩子，一直以来所有的想法都专注于自身。如果年纪再大一些，被孤零零地留在这个世界上，她一定会焦躁不安。但是她年纪还小，且一直有人照顾，因此便认为一切都会和以前一样。她现在想的是：自己是否会被送到个好人家；收养自己的人是否会像印度奶妈和其他印度仆人一样对她礼貌有加、百依百顺。","Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone.She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had always done.If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants had done."
"最开始她被送到了一个英国牧师的家里。她知道自己在那里呆不久。她不想呆在那里。牧师很穷，家里有五个年纪相当的孩子。他们常常衣衫褴褛，总是不停地争吵，抢夺玩具。玛丽讨厌他们这个邋遢的小屋，对他们也不友善。没过一两天，就没有人愿意与她玩耍了。第二天，他们还给她取了个绰号，更是让她火冒三丈。","She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman’s house where she was taken at first.She did not want to stay.The English clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other.Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her.By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious."
"是巴兹尔先想起这个名字的。巴兹尔是个小男孩儿。他长了一双看上去粗鲁冒失的蓝眼睛，朝天鼻，玛丽很讨厌他。本来，她自己一个人在树下玩儿，就像霍乱爆发那天一样。这时巴兹尔过来了，站在旁边看她堆小土堆，造花园小路。不一会儿，他觉得很有趣，于是插嘴给了个建议。","It was Basil who thought of it first.Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him.She was playing by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out.She was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her.Presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion."
"“你为什么不在那边砌一堆石头做假山呢？”他说，“就是中间那个地方，”他边说边俯身越过她指着。","“Why don’t you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?” he said.“There in the middle,” and he leaned over her to point."
"“滚远点！”玛丽大喊，“我不要男生。滚开！”","“Go away!” cried Mary. “I don’t want boys. Go away!”"
"巴兹尔最开始很生气，不过很快他就开始捉弄玛丽。他也总爱捉弄自己的妹妹们。他围着玛丽跳舞，做鬼脸，唱歌，嬉笑。","For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease.He was always teasing his sisters.He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed."
"“玛丽小姐，倔强非常，你的花园，怎番模样？银色风铃，鸟蛤贝壳，美丽金盏，排列一行。”","“Mistress Mary, quite contrary,How does your garden grow?With silver bells, and cockle shells,And marigolds all in a row.”"
"他不停地唱，唱到其他孩子也听见，跟着哄笑起来。玛丽越生气，他们就越唱得起劲“玛丽小姐，倔强异常”。自此以后，只要她和他们一起，凡是他们相互之间谈起她，或是和她讲话时，都这么叫她。","He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang “Mistress Mary, quite contrary”; and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary” when they spoke of her to each other, and often when they spoke to her."
"一天，巴兹尔告诉她说：“这个周末你就要被送回家去了。我们很高兴。”","“You are going to be sent home,” Basil said to her, “at the end of the week.And we’re glad of it.”"
"“我也很高兴。”玛丽回答说，“但家是指哪里呢？”","“I am glad of it, too,” answered Mary.“Where is home?”"
"“她居然不知道家在哪里！”巴兹尔用七岁小孩子的鄙视的语气说道，“当然是在英国。我们的奶奶住在那里。我的姐姐梅布尔去年就被送去她那里了。你不是被送去你奶奶那里。因为你没有奶奶。你要去你姑父那里。他叫阿奇博尔德·克雷文。”","“She doesn’t know where home is!” said Basil, with seven-year-old scorn.“It’s England, of course.Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent to her last year.You are not going to your grandmama.You have none.You are going to your uncle.His name is Mr. Archibald Craven.”"
"“我根本不认识他。”玛丽打断他。","“I don’t know anything about him,” snapped Mary."
"“我知道你不认识他。”巴兹尔回答说，“你什么也不懂。女生都这样。我听爸爸妈妈说起他了。他住在乡下一个大而荒凉的老房子里，没人接近他。他脾气很坏，不准人接近。不过就算是他愿意，也没人愿意靠近他。他是个大驼背，样子很吓人。”“我不相信你。”玛丽大喊，说完转身用双手堵住耳朵，不想继续听下去。","“I know you don’t,” Basil answered.“You don’t know anything.Girls never do.I heard father and mother talking about him.He lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him.He’s so cross he won’t let them, and they wouldn’t come if he would let them.He’s a hunchback, and he’s horrid.”“I don’t believe you,” said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her fingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more."
"不过后来她还是反复琢磨了这件事。当天晚上，克劳福德太太告诉她说几天后她将要乘船去英国，去米瑟斯韦特庄园她姑父阿奇博尔德那里。她所表现出的冰冷和无动于衷让夫妇俩不知道拿她怎么办。他们试图对她好些。但克劳福德太太想吻她时，她别过了脸；克劳福德先生轻拍她肩膀时，她又马上绷紧了身体。","But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her.They tried to be kind to her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her shoulder."
"克劳福德太太后来不无惋惜地说：“她可真是个平庸的孩子。她妈妈可真是个尤物啊。举止也那么优雅。但玛丽的举止在我见过的孩子中是最乏味的。孩子们都叫她“玛丽小姐，倔强异常”，虽然是调皮之举，却不难理解他们为什么这么叫。”","“She is such a plain child,” Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.“And her mother was such a pretty creature.She had a very pretty manner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a child.The children call her ‘Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,’ and though it’s naughty of them, one can’t help understanding it.”"
"“她那美丽优雅的妈妈若能多花些时间在幼儿室，玛丽或许能多学到一些。但可惜的是，美人已逝啊。要知道，很多人甚至还不知道她有孩子呢。”","“Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too.It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.”"
"“我想她都没见过自己的孩子几次。”克劳福德太太叹气道，“奶妈死了，更是没人想起这可怜的小东西了。想想看，仆人都跑掉了，就剩她一个人在那个废弃的小屋里。麦格鲁上校说当他打开门，看到她一个人站在屋子中央时，吓得差点魂飞魄散。”","“I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,” sighed Mrs. Crawford.“When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing.Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow.Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room.”"
"玛丽在一个军官妻子的照料下，经过长途旅行到达了英国。军官妻子是要把她的孩子安置在一所寄宿学校的。因此，她的心思几乎都在自己的儿女身上。到了伦敦，便非常开心地把玛丽交给了阿奇博尔德·克雷文先生遣来接她的人。她是米瑟斯韦特庄园的管家梅德洛克太太。她身材壮实，脸颊很红，黑色双眼目光犀利。她穿了一条深紫色裙子，一个镶着黝黑花边的黑色丝质斗篷，头戴装饰着天鹅绒质地紫色花朵的黑帽子。头晃动的时候，那些花朵也伸出来，跟着颤动。玛丽一点儿也不喜欢她。不过这也不足为奇，因为她本来也就鲜少喜欢什么人。何况显然梅德洛克太太也没怎么把她放在心上。","Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer’s wife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school.She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in London.The woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock.She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes.She wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head.Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her."
"“天啊，就这么一个平庸的小家伙！”她叫道，“我听说她妈妈可是个美人啊。她的美貌可没传给后代多少，是不是？”“也许她长大些会变好看点。”军官的太太好心替她辩解，“她的脸型其实还不错，就是脸色有些蜡黄，表情不好。小孩子变化很大。”","“My word! she’s a plain little piece of goods!” she said.“And we’d heard that her mother was a beauty.She hasn’t handed much of it down, has she, ma’am?”“Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,” the officer’s wife said good-naturedly.“If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression, her features are rather good.Children alter so much.”"
"“那她可得变很多才行。”梅德洛克太太答道，“而且，要是让我说，米瑟斯韦特庄园可不是一个能让孩子进步很多的地方！”她们以为玛丽没在听她们讲话，因为玛丽站在这个小私人旅馆的窗边，离她们还有一段距离。玛丽在窗边看着往来的公车、出租车和行人，却把她们的对话听得一清二楚。她开始对自己的姑父和他住的那个地方产生了好奇。那是个什么地方，他是个什么样的人呢？驼背什么样？她从来没有见过。也许印度没有驼背吧。","“She’ll have to alter a good deal,” answered Mrs. Medlock.“And, there’s nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite—if you ask me!”They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to.She was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in.What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like?What was a hunchback?She had never seen one.Perhaps there were none in India."
"自从住进别人家里，身边没有奶妈照料，她慢慢开始感到孤独，脑子里也冒出了以前从未有过的怪念头。她不明白，为什么即使父母都活着的时候，她好像也从来没有属于过任何人。别的孩子好像都属于他们的父母，但是她好像从来都不是任何人的小女孩儿。她虽然有仆人，衣食无缺，但却从未有人关心她。她不明白这都是因为自己不好相处。在当时她哪里有这种意识。她常常觉得是别人不好相处，而没有意识到其实自己才是那个不好相处的人。","Since she had been living in other people’s houses and had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her.She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive.Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be anyone’s little girl.She had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice of her.She did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable.She often thought that other people were, but she did not know that she was so herself."
"她认为梅德洛克太太是她见过的最不好相处的人。无论是她那深色的脸还是她精致的帽子都显得很俗气。第二天她们便启程去约克郡了。她昂首挺胸地穿过火车站，走向车厢，尽量和梅德洛克太太离远些，她不想自己在别人看来像是梅德洛克太太带着的小孩儿。只要一想起别人可能认为她是这个女人的女儿，她就很生气。","She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet.When the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want to seem to belong to her.It would have made her angry to think people imagined she was her little girl."
"不过，梅德洛克太太对她和她的想法却毫不在意。她是那种“决不容许年轻人胡作非为”的女人。至少别人问起她，她一定这么回答。她本来不想来伦敦的，她妹妹玛丽亚的女儿马上就要结婚了。但是米瑟斯韦特庄园的管家这份工作既舒服，报酬也丰厚。要想保住这份工作，阿奇博尔德先生吩咐什么她就必须马上执行。她连问题都没敢问一个。","But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts.She was the kind of woman who would “stand no nonsense from young ones.”At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked.She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria’s daughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do.She never dared even to ask a question."
"“伦诺克斯上尉和他的太太在霍乱中去世了。”克雷文先生简短而冰冷地说，“伦诺克斯上尉是我妻子的弟弟，我是他们女儿的监护人。得把这孩子接过来。你必须去伦敦亲自把她接过来。”","“Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,” Mr. Craven had said in his short, cold way.“Captain Lennox was my wife’s brother and I am their daughter’s guardian.The child is to be brought here.You must go to London and bring her yourself.”"
"于是她收拾了自己的小皮箱，跑了这一趟。","So she packed her small trunk and made the journey."
"玛丽坐在车厢角落里，显得平淡但有些焦躁不安。她没有可以阅读的东西，也不知道看些什么，一双干瘦的小手戴着黑色手套，交叉放在大腿上。在黑裙子的衬托下她显得越发蜡黄。稀疏的头发从黑色丝帽下无精打采地散落出来。","Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful.She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in her lap.Her black dress made her look yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crepe hat."
"梅德洛克太太想：“我这辈子没有碰到过这么‘痞’的小孩儿。”‘痞’是约克郡的方言，意思是骄纵、易怒。她从没见过可以僵坐在那里无所事事的小孩儿。最后，她看玛丽看累了，开始用快而僵硬的语气对她说话。","“A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,” Mrs. Medlock thought.(Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.) She had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hard voice."
"“我想我应该给你讲讲你将要去的地方。”她说，“你知道你姑父吗？”","“I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to,” she said.“Do you know anything about your uncle?”"
"“我不知道。”玛丽说。","“No,” said Mary."
"“你就从没听你爸妈讲起过他吗？”","“Never heard your father and mother talk about him?”"
"“没有。”玛丽皱皱眉头。她皱眉，是因为她不记得父母跟她讲起过任何事情。无疑，他们从未对她讲起过什么。","“No,” said Mary frowning.She frowned because she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular.Certainly they had never told her things."
"“哦。”梅德洛克太太盯着她奇怪的、面无表情的小脸嘟囔着。她停顿了一会儿，继续说道：","“Humph,” muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsive little face.She did not say any more for a few moments and then she began again."
"“那我觉得应该告诉你些事情，你好有些准备。你即将到的地方有些古怪。”","“I suppose you might as well be told something—to prepare you.You are going to a queer place.”"
"玛丽依然沉默不语。梅德洛克太太对她明显的冷漠感到非常郁闷，但还是深吸一口气，继续讲了下去。","Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on."
"“尽管那房子很大很宏伟，却有些阴森。克雷文先生用自己的方式为这所房子感到自豪，他的方式也足够阴森。房子有六百多年的历史了，地处旷野边上。里面有接近一百个房间，不过大部分都锁了起来。里面有画、精美的古董家具、还有很多颇有年代的东西。房子四周是一个大园子，长长的树枝拖到了地上。”她停顿了一下，喘了口气，“但是别的就什么都没有了。”她突然停了下来。","“Not but that it’s a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven’s proud of it in his way—and that’s gloomy enough, too.The house is six hundred years old and it’s on the edge of the moor, and there’s near a hundred rooms in it, though most of them’s shut up and locked.And there’s pictures and fine old furniture and things that’s been there for ages, and there’s a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground—some of them.”She paused and took another breath.“But there’s nothing else,” she ended suddenly."
"玛丽不由自主地开始听了起来。这一切听起来和印度都是那么的不同，而一切新奇的东西都非常吸引她。但她不想表现出自己感兴趣。这也是她不招人喜欢的做法之一。于是她继续安静不动地坐着。","Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself.It all sounded so unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her.But she did not intend to look as if she were interested.That was one of her unhappy, disagreeable ways.So she sat still."
"“好吧，”梅德洛克太太说，“你觉得怎么样？”","“Well,” said Mrs. Medlock.“What do you think of it?”"
"她回答道：“没什么。我对这种地方一无所知。”","“Nothing,” she answered.“I know nothing about such places.”"
"梅德洛克太太短促地笑出声来。","That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh."
"“呵呵！”她说，“但是你看起来像个老妇人。这你也不介意么？”","“Eh!” she said, “but you are like an old woman.Don’t you care?”"
"玛丽回答道：“我介不介意都无所谓。”","“It doesn’t matter” said Mary, “whether I care or not.”"
"“这倒是一点儿都不假。”梅德洛克太太说，“确实无所谓。我不知道你为什么会被送来米瑟斯韦特庄园寄养，也许这是最简单的办法吧。毫无疑问的，他绝对不会因为你而给自己惹麻烦。他从不为别人的事情麻烦自己。”","“You are right enough there,” said Mrs. Medlock.“It doesn’t.What you’re to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don’t know, unless because it’s the easiest way.He’s not going to trouble himself about you, that’s sure and certain.He never troubles himself about no one.”"
"她突然像是想起什么似的，停了下来。","She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time."
"“他是个驼背。”她说道，“这可害苦了他。他年轻时过得很苦，他的钱和大房子都是在他结婚后才派上用场的。”","“He’s got a crooked back,” she said.“That set him wrong.He was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married.”"
"尽管玛丽想表现出不关心，眼睛还是不由自主地转向梅德洛克太太。她从没想到过驼背还能结婚，还是小小吃了一惊。梅德洛克太太把一切看在了眼里。本来就很健谈的她，说得更加起劲了。这多少也是个打发时间的办法。","Mary’s eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to care.She had never thought of the hunchback’s being married and she was a trifle surprised.Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest.This was one way of passing some of the time, at any rate."
"“她甜美漂亮。克雷文先生为了找到她想要的一片草，可以跑遍全世界。人们都觉得她不会嫁给他，但她确实嫁了。人们都说她是图他的钱才嫁给他的。但她不是，绝对不是。”她非常肯定地说，“她死的时候——”","“She was a sweet, pretty thing and he’d have walked the world over to get her a blade o’ grass she wanted.Nobody thought she’d marry him, but she did, and people said she married him for his money.But she didn’t—she didn’t,” positively.“When she died—”"
"玛丽不自觉地跳了起来。","Mary gave a little involuntary jump."
"“啊，她死了吗！”她禁不住惊呼道。这让她想到自己读过的一个法国童话故事《利凯小簇》。故事讲的就是一个穷驼背和一个漂亮公主的故事。她突然开始可怜起阿奇博尔德·克雷文先生了。","“Oh! did she die!” she exclaimed, quite without meaning to.She had just remembered a French fairy story she had once read called “Riquet a la Houppe.”It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven."
"“对，她死了。”梅德洛克太太回答说，“自此以后他就更加古怪了。他不关心任何人。也不见人。他常常外出。呆在庄园里的时候，也总是把自己锁在园子的西翼，除了皮切尔不见任何人。皮切尔是一个老人，从先生小时候就开始照料他，很了解他的脾性。”","“Yes, she died,” Mrs. Medlock answered.“And it made him queerer than ever.He cares about nobody.He won’t see people.Most of the time he goes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the West Wing and won’t let any one but Pitcher see him.Pitcher’s an old fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways.”"
"这一切听起来像是书中的故事，玛丽听了怎么也高兴不起来。故事里有个有上百间房间的大宅，大宅里有一百个房间，几乎所有的房门都紧闭且上了锁——大宅在旷野旁——无论旷野是什么样子，听起来都让人感到绝望。还有一个把自己关在房间里的驼背男人！玛丽嘴唇紧闭盯着窗外。大雨像倾斜的灰线，顺着窗棂往下流。这一切看起来都是那么自然。要是那个美丽的妻子还活着的话，她也许会像自己的妈妈一样，穿着满是蕾丝的长袍，跑进跑出参加各种聚会。这样一来，气氛就会活跃很多。但她已经死了。","It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel cheerful.A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked—a house on the edge of a moor—whatsoever a moor was—sounded dreary.A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes.If the pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks “full of lace.”But she was not there any more."
"“十有八九你是看不到他的，你也别指望能看到。”梅德洛克太太说，“你也别期待能有人跟你说话。你需要自己玩儿，自己照顾自己。有人会告诉你哪些房间能进，哪些不能。花园就够你玩儿的了。在房间里的时候，别到处乱逛，乱摸。克雷文先生讨厌这种行为。”","“You needn’t expect to see him, because ten to one you won’t,” said Mrs. Medlock.“And you mustn’t expect that there will be people to talk to you.You’ll have to play about and look after yourself.You’ll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you’re to keep out of.There’s gardens enough.But when you’re in the house don’t go wandering and poking about.Mr. Craven won’t have it.”"
"“我不会东摸西碰的。”乖戾的小玛丽突然插嘴。就像她突然对阿奇博尔德先生心生怜悯一样，怜悯之情突然消失了，她开始觉得他非常讨厌，他所经历的一切都是咎由自取。","“I shall not want to go poking about,” said sour little Mary and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him."
"她说完便把脸转向流淌着雨水的车窗玻璃，盯着窗外灰色的暴雨。暴雨好像永远也不会停下来一样。她定定地看了许久，眼前的灰色越来越阴沉，她睡着了。","And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever.She watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep."
"第三章 穿过旷野","CHAPTER III ACROSS THE MOOR"
"玛丽睡了很久，醒来时梅德洛克太太早已从一个车站买来了个午餐篮。她们吃了些鸡肉、冷牛肉、面包黄油，还喝了些热茶。瓢泼大雨似乎下得更大了。车站里的每个人都穿着亮闪闪的雨衣，雨衣已经被打湿了。保安人员点亮了车厢里的灯。梅德洛克太太吃过饭喝过茶后情绪也缓过来许多。她茶足饭饱之后就睡着了。玛丽则坐在一边盯着她，看到她那精致的帽子滑向一边。最后，她自己也伴着雨水敲打车窗的声音再次入睡。她再次醒来的时候外面已经很黑了。火车停在了一个站台，梅德洛克太太正在一旁摇晃她。","She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea.The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs.The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef.She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows.It was quite dark when she awakened again.The train had stopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her."
"“你可真能睡！”她嚷嚷着，“该醒醒了！我们到了斯威特站了。前面还有很长一段路等着我们呢。”","“You have had a sleep!” she said.“It’s time to open your eyes!We’re at Thwaite Station and we’ve got a long drive before us.”"
"玛丽站了起来，试图睁开眼睛。梅德洛克太太已经开始收拾行李了。玛丽没有主动帮忙。在印度，总有土著仆人帮着拿东西，搬行李。所以在她看来，接受别人的服侍也都那么理所应当。","Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her parcels.The little girl did not offer to help her, because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one."
"这是个小站，除了她们俩，好像没什么人下车。站长友善地和梅德洛克太太说话。他嗓门很粗，口音也很奇怪，显得有些宽。后来玛丽才知道那是约克郡方言。","The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train.The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire."
"“我瞧纳（你）回来了啊。”他说道，“把孩子带回来了！”","“I see tha’s got back,” he said.“An’ tha’s browt th’ young ‘un with thee.”"
"“是啊，就是她。”梅德洛克太太也用约克郡方言回答道，同时把头甩向玛丽这边示意了一下。“你太太还好吧？”","“Aye, that’s her,” answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.“How’s thy Missus?”"
"“还不错。马车在外面等着你们呢。”","“Well enow.Th’ carriage is waitin’ outside for thee.”"
"外面的小站台前停着一辆布鲁厄姆马车。玛丽觉得这马车和扶她上车的车夫都很时髦。他穿着长长的雨衣，帽子上盖着防水布。所有的一切，连同那个站长，都滴着雨水，闪闪发亮。","A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform.Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in.His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included."
"他关上车门，和车夫一起安置好行李箱，他们就出发了。玛丽发现自己坐的地方有坐垫，很舒服，不过却没什么睡意了。她坐在那里好奇地看着窗外的路，它正通向梅德洛克太太口中那个古怪的地方。她绝不是个胆小的孩子，也不能说是被吓到了，只是感到有些前路难料——一个旷野旁的房子，一个有上百间几乎都上锁的屋子的大房子，会有什么等着她呢？","When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again.She sat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of.She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house standing on the edge of a moor."
"“什么是旷野？”她突然问梅德洛克太太。","“What is a moor?” she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock."
"“再过十分钟你朝窗外看就能看到了。”梅德洛克太太回答道，“我们得在米瑟荒原上走五英里，才能到家呢。今晚太黑，你看不太清楚，不过多少能看到些。”","“Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you’ll see,” the woman answered.“We’ve got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor.You won’t see much because it’s a dark night, but you can see something.”"
"玛丽不再提问。她坐在自己黑暗的角落里望着窗外。通过马车灯在她们前面投下的一束束光线，她匆匆瞥了瞥路上经过的景物。出站后经过了一个小村庄，她看到粉刷成白色的农舍和透着灯光的小酒馆。而后他们经过了一座教堂、牧师的住处、一间农舍里一个小橱窗模样的地方，里面摆了些玩具、糖果和其他小玩意儿出售。接着马车上了公路，她看到了篱笆和树木。接下来很久都没什么变化——至少她觉得很久。","Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner, keeping her eyes on the window.The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed.After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house.Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set out for sale.Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees.After that there seemed nothing different for a long time—or at least it seemed a long time to her."
"马车终于慢了下来，好像开始爬坡了，同时好像也没有篱笆和树木了。事实上她什么也看不到了，两边一片浓黑。马车猛地颠了一下，她身体前倾，脸压在了玻璃窗上。","At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees.She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side.She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt."
"“嗯！现在可以确定我们上旷野了。”梅德洛克太太说。","“Eh! We’re on the moor now sure enough,” said Mrs. Medlock."
"车灯打出的黄色的光照在粗糙的路面上。路像是从灌木丛和低矮的植物中穿过。这些植物最后消失在了无边无际的黑暗当中。耳边呼啸着单调、狂野、低沉、急促的风声。","The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound."
"“这，这不是海，对吗？”玛丽转身询问自己的旅伴。","“It’s—it’s not the sea, is it?” said Mary, looking round at her companion."
"“不，当然不是。”梅德洛克太太回答道，“这也不是田野或山脉，就只是无边无际的荒地，除了石南、荆豆、金雀花之外，这里寸草不生，动物就只有野马驹和绵羊。”","“No, not it,” answered Mrs. Medlock.“Nor it isn’t fields nor mountains, it’s just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.”"
"“我觉得这上面要是有水，就像是海了。”玛丽说，“刚才听起来像海。”","“I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,” said Mary.“It sounds like the sea just now.”"
"“那是风吹过灌木丛的声音。”梅德洛克太太回答道，“很多人喜欢这旷野，尤其是石南花开的时候。不过对我来说这地方实在太荒凉阴郁了点。”","“That’s the wind blowing through the bushes,” Mrs. Medlock said.“It’s a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there’s plenty that likes it—particularly when the heather’s in bloom.”"
"马车继续行驶在黑暗中。雨虽然停了，风呼啸掠过，发出奇怪的声音。道路崎岖不平。马车还经过了几座小桥，桥下水流很急，发出很大的响声。玛丽觉得这旅程是没尽头了。宽广荒凉的旷野就像是一片深黑色的海洋，自己正沿着窄窄一条干地穿越其中。","On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds.The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise.Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land."
"“我不喜欢这里。”她心里想着，“一点儿也不喜欢，”嘴唇抿得更紧了。","“I don’t like it,” she said to herself.“I don’t like it,” and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together."
"马车开始爬坡，玛丽看到了灯光。梅德洛克太太也看到了这亮光，她长长舒了一口气。","The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light.Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief."
"“啊，真高兴看到那亮光了。”她大喊，“那是门房的灯光。等会儿说什么我们也得好好喝杯茶。”","“Eh, I am glad to see that bit o’ light twinkling,” she exclaimed.“It’s the light in the lodge window.We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events.”"
"果真如她说的那样，需要“等会儿”。马车进了庄园大门后，又沿着林荫道走了两英里。道路两旁高大的树木几乎越过头顶相接，马车仿佛行驶在昏暗的拱顶走廊之中。","It was “after a bit,” as she said, for when the carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault."
"马车从拱顶走廊驶入一片开阔的地方，便停在了一个低矮的房子前面。那房子很长，就那么随便地散布在一个石头院子周围。最开始玛丽还以为没有亮灯的窗户了。但她下车后发现楼上角落处的一间屋子里还有黯淡的红光。","They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court.At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow."
"大门非常巨大，是用厚重的、奇形怪状的橡木板做成的。木板上还镶嵌了大铁钉和大铁棒。打开大门，是一间巨大的厅堂。厅堂内灯光昏暗。无论是墙上的画像，还是穿着盔甲的雕像，玛丽都不想多看一眼。她站在石头地板上，看起来像是一个渺小奇怪的小黑影。她的内心也同外表一样感到渺小、迷失、古怪。","The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars.It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them.As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked."
"一个整洁消瘦的老人站在为他们开门的男仆身边。","A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them."
"“你带她去她房间。”他用沙哑的声音说，“先生不想见她。他明早要去伦敦。”","“You are to take her to her room,” he said in a husky voice.“He doesn’t want to see her.He’s going to London in the morning.”"
"“是的，皮切尔先生。”梅德洛克太太回答说，“只要吩咐我一声，我就知道怎么做了。”","“Very well, Mr. Pitcher,” Mrs. Medlock answered.“So long as I know what’s expected of me, I can manage.”"
"“你要做的，梅德洛克太太，”皮切尔接着说，“就是确保不打扰到先生，不让他看到他不想见的东西。”","“What’s expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Pitcher said, “is that you make sure that he’s not disturbed and that he doesn’t see what he doesn’t want to see.”"
"梅德洛克太太领着玛丽去她的房间。她们爬了一段宽楼梯，下了一个长廊，又上了一小段台阶，穿过一个又一个长廊才到。屋子里有炉火，桌上有晚餐。","And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table."
"梅德洛克太太冷冰冰地说：","Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:"
"“好了，就是这儿了。这个房子连同隔壁那间都是给你住的。你就在这两间房，别乱跑。记住了啊！”","“Well, here you are!This room and the next are where you’ll live—and you must keep to them.Don’t you forget that!”"
"就这样，玛丽小姐来到了米瑟斯韦特庄园。这也许是她这辈子最糟糕的经历了。","It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life."
"第四章 玛莎","CHAPTER IV MARTHA"
"第二天早晨，玛丽睁开眼睛。一个年轻的女仆正跪在壁炉旁的小毯子上往外扒煤渣，响声吵醒了她。玛丽躺在床上打量了她片刻，然后开始打量这个房间。玛丽从未见过这样的房间，觉得它阴暗却新奇。墙上挂着壁毯，毯上绣着森林景色。树下有盛装的人，远处隐约可以看到城堡的角楼。画里还有猎人、马匹、狗、淑女。玛丽觉得自己仿佛和他们一样置身森林当中。透过一扇深陷的窗户，她看到一大片上坡地，地上好像没有树木，看起来像是一片一望无际，阴郁的紫色海洋。","When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily.Mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room.She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy.The walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it.There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle.There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies.Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them.Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea."
"“那是什么？”她指着窗外问。","“What is that?” she said, pointing out of the window."
"那个年轻的女仆玛莎刚刚起身，她也望了过去，指着说：“是那里吗？”","Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and pointed also.“That there?” she said."
"“对。”","“Yes.”"
"“那就是旷野。”她善意地微微一笑，“你喜欢吗？”","“That’s th’ moor,” with a good-natured grin.“Does tha’ like it?”"
"“不。”玛丽回答道，“我讨厌它。”","“No,” answered Mary.“I hate it.”"
"“那是因为你还没习惯呢。”玛莎说着又回到火炉旁，“你现在会觉得它太空旷了。以后你会慢慢喜欢上的。”","“That’s because tha’rt not used to it,” Martha said, going back to her hearth.“Tha’ thinks it’s too big an’ bare now.But tha’ will like it.”"
"“那你呢？”玛丽问。","“Do you?” inquired Mary."
"“啊，我喜欢。”玛莎开心地擦拭着炉格，边回答道，“我很喜欢。我觉得它一点儿也不空旷。这上面长满了有生命的东西，闻着也是香甜的。春天和夏天最好了。荆豆、金雀、石南都开花了。闻起来像蜜一样。空气新鲜极了，天空显得那么高，蜜蜂和云雀叫得也非常动听。啊。这旷野，可是拿什么我都不换的。”","“Aye, that I do,” answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the grate.“I just love it.It’s none bare.It’s covered wi’ growin’ things as smells sweet.It’s fair lovely in spring an’ summer when th’ gorse an’ broom an’ heather’s in flower.It smells o’ honey an’ there’s such a lot o’ fresh air—an’ th’ sky looks so high an’ th’ bees an’ skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin’ an’ singin’.Eh!I wouldn’t live away from th’ moor for anythin’.”"
"玛丽表情严肃、迷惑不解地听着。这个女仆和自己以前习惯的印度仆人一点儿都不一样。他们总是卑躬屈膝像奴隶一样，不敢造次，不敢胆大妄为地认为自己可以和主人平等对话。他们对主人行额手礼，用“穷人的保护者”这类的称呼称呼主人。印度仆人是被命令，而不是被请求做事。对他们不需要说“请”或者“谢谢”，玛丽常常生气时对着奶妈一个耳光就掴上去。玛丽琢磨着，如果给这个小姑娘一个耳光，她会怎么样呢。她是个圆乎乎，有着玫瑰肤色，看起来好脾气的小姑娘。但她也有些倔强，玛丽猜想。如果掴她的也只是个小女孩儿，她甚至能搧回去。","Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression.The native servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this.They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals.They made salaams and called them “protector of the poor” and names of that sort.Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked.It was not the custom to say “please” and “thank you” and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the face when she was angry.She wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face.She was a round, rosy, good-natured-looking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary wonder if she might not even slap back—if the person who slapped her was only a little girl."
"“你这个仆人可真奇怪。”她靠在枕头上，傲慢地说。","“You are a strange servant,” she said from her pillows, rather haughtily."
"玛莎跪坐在地上，手上拿着鞋刷，笑了起来，她一点儿都没有发脾气。","Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of temper."
"“哦！我知道。”她说，“要是米瑟斯韦特有女主人的话，我肯定当不了贴身仆人。也许能让我去厨房帮厨什么的，但肯定不让我在卧室服侍。我长得太普通，说话约克郡口音也太重。不过这房子很大，很有意思。除了皮切尔先生和管家太太，似乎不存在男主人或女主人。克雷文先生即使在家也什么都不关心，更何况他几乎总在外面。梅德洛克太太出于好心安排了这个差事给我。她告诉我，要是米瑟斯韦特和其他庄园一样，她绝对不会这样做。”“你以后就是我的仆人了吗？”玛丽仍旧一副专横跋扈的印度做派。","“Eh! I know that,” she said.“If there was a grand Missus at Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th’ under house-maids.I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I’d never have been let upstairs.I’m too common an’ I talk too much Yorkshire.But this is a funny house for all it’s so grand.Seems like there’s neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an’ Mrs. Medlock.Mr. Craven, he won’t be troubled about anythin’ when he’s here, an’ he’s nearly always away.Mrs. Medlock gave me th’ place out o’ kindness.She told me she could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.”“Are you going to be my servant?”Mary asked, still in her imperious little Indian way."
"玛莎继续擦着她那炉格。","Martha began to rub her grate again."
"“我是梅德洛克太太的仆人。”她不卑不亢地回答，“她是克雷文先生的仆人。我来是做些仆人的工作，顺带照顾你。不过你不需要很多照料。”","“I’m Mrs. Medlock’s servant,” she said stoutly.“An’ she’s Mr. Craven’s—but I’m to do the housemaid’s work up here an’ wait on you a bit.But you won’t need much waitin’ on.”"
"“那谁来给我穿衣服呢？”玛丽问。","“Who is going to dress me?” demanded Mary."
"玛莎又坐直了身子瞪大了眼睛。她吃惊地用发音很宽的约克郡方言问道：","Martha sat up on her heels again and stared.She spoke in broad Yorkshire in her amazement."
"“纳（你）八（不）会自己穿牙（衣）服吗？”","“Canna’ tha’ dress thysen!” she said."
"“你说什么？我听不懂你在说什么。”玛丽问道。","“What do you mean?I don’t understand your language,” said Mary."
"“哦！我忘记了。”玛莎说，“梅德洛克太太告诉过我让我说话注意，不然你不明白我在说什么。我的意思是说你自己不会穿衣服吗？”","“Eh! I forgot,” Martha said.“Mrs. Medlock told me I’d have to be careful or you wouldn’t know what I was sayin’.I mean can’t you put on your own clothes?”"
"“不会。”玛丽愤愤地回答道，“我这辈子从没干过这事。都是奶妈给我穿衣服的。”","“No,” answered Mary, quite indignantly.“I never did in my life.My Ayah dressed me, of course.”"
"“那么，”玛莎说，显然丝毫没察觉到自己的鲁莽，“你是时候学学了。现在都有些晚了。学着自己照顾自己对你有好处。我妈妈常说，那些大人物的小孩儿，不长成傻瓜才怪呢。见天有保姆照顾着，有人给洗澡，有人给穿衣服，还像对待小狗一样带他们出去散步。”","“Well,” said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she was impudent, “it’s time tha’ should learn.Tha’ cannot begin younger.It’ll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit.My mother always said she couldn’t see why grand people’s children didn’t turn out fair fools—what with nurses an’ bein’ washed an’ dressed an’ took out to walk as if they was puppies!”"
"“印度不是这样的。”玛丽鄙夷地说。她快受不了了。","“It is different in India,” said Mistress Mary disdainfully.She could scarcely stand this."
"但玛莎丝毫没受影响。","But Martha was not at all crushed."
"“哦！我能看出不同。”她甚至用带着同情的语气回答道，“不过我敢说那是因为那里黑人太多，而高贵的白人太少。当时听说你从印度来，我还以为你也是黑人呢。”","“Eh! I can see it’s different,” she answered almost sympathetically.“I dare say it’s because there’s such a lot o’ blacks there instead o’ respectable white people.When I heard you was comin’ from India I thought you was a black too.”"
"玛丽怒火冲天地从床上坐起来。","Mary sat up in bed furious."
"“你说什么！”她说，“说什么呢！你认为我也是土著。你！你个猪养的！“","“What!” she said. “What! You thought I was a native. You—you daughter of a pig!”"
"玛莎瞪着两眼，满脸通红。","Martha stared and looked hot."
"“你说谁呢？”她说，“你没必要火气这么大。年轻的淑女可不能这样说话。我一点儿没有瞧不起黑人的意思。小册子里讲到的他们都很虔诚。里面说黑人是我们的兄弟。我从没见过黑人，所以以为能近距离见到一个，我还很高兴呢。早晨我进来生火的时候，还偷偷溜到你床边，小心把被子拉下来看你。结果你就是这个样子。”她语带失望，“不比我黑嘛，至多黄一些。”","“Who are you callin’ names?” she said.“You needn’t be so vexed.That’s not th’ way for a young lady to talk.I’ve nothin’ against th’ blacks.When you read about ’em in tracts they’re always very religious.You always read as a black’s a man an’ a brother.I’ve never seen a black an’ I was fair pleased to think I was goin’ to see one close.When I come in to light your fire this mornin’ I crep’ up to your bed an’ pulled th’ cover back careful to look at you.An’ there you was,” disappointedly, “no more black than me—for all you’re so yeller.”"
"玛丽觉得羞辱无比，怒不可遏。“你竟然认为我是土著！你胆敢！你根本不了解土著！他们根本不是人——他们是仆人，必须对主人行额手礼。你对印度一无所知。你什么都不懂！”","Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.“You thought I was a native!You dared!You don’t know anything about natives!They are not people—they’re servants who must salaam to you.You know nothing about India.You know nothing about anything!”"
"在玛莎单纯的注视下，愤怒的玛丽感到如此无助。不知为什么，她突然感到异常孤独，远离了一切自己了解，也了解自己的东西。她埋头扑在枕头上痛哭了起来。看她哭得那么伤心，好心肠的玛莎有点儿被吓到了，她觉得很抱歉。她走到床边，俯下身去，","She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl’s simple stare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her.She went to the bed and bent over her."
"“哎，你别这样哭了。”她央求着，“你千万别哭了。我不知道这会惹你生气。就像你说的，我的确什么都不懂。求求你了，小姐。别哭了。”","“Eh! you mustn’t cry like that there!” she begged.“You mustn’t for sure.I didn’t know you’d be vexed.I don’t know anythin’ about anythin’—just like you said.I beg your pardon, Miss.Do stop cryin’.”"
"她那奇怪的约克郡口音似乎有种抚慰的、发自内心的友好的成分在内，加上她那坚定的口吻，对玛丽起了作用。她渐渐停止了哭泣，安静了下来。玛莎松了口气。","There was something comforting and really friendly in her queer Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary.She gradually ceased crying and became quiet.Martha looked relieved."
"“你现在该起床了。”她说，“梅德洛克太太让我把你的早饭、茶点和晚饭端到隔壁房间去。那间房改成你的幼儿室了。你要是起床，我就帮你穿衣服。当然，是那种扣子在背后，你自己扣不上的啊。”","“It’s time for thee to get up now,” she said.“Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha’ breakfast an’ tea an’ dinner into th’ room next to this.It’s been made into a nursery for thee.I’ll help thee on with thy clothes if tha’ll get out o’ bed.If th’ buttons are at th’ back tha’ cannot button them up tha’self.”"
"玛丽终于决定起床了。玛莎从衣橱里拿出了衣服，却不是昨晚她和梅德洛克太太回来的时候穿的。","When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the wardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night before with Mrs. Medlock."
"“这不是我的衣服。”她说，“我的衣服是黑色的。”","“Those are not mine,” she said.“Mine are black.”"
"说完她看了眼那厚实的白色羊毛外套和连衣裙，镇静地赞同说道：","She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool approval:"
"“这衣服比我的好。”","“Those are nicer than mine.”"
"“你一定要穿。”玛莎回答道，“这都是克雷文先生吩咐梅德洛克太太在伦敦买的。他说‘我不想看到一个穿着黑衣服的孩子像个孤魂野鬼一样到处游荡’。他还说‘那这儿就更加凄凉了。给她买点鲜艳的衣服’。我妈妈说她知道先生什么意思。妈妈觉得自己洞悉人心。但其实那是她自己不喜欢黑色。”","“These are th’ ones tha’ must put on,” Martha answered.“Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get ’em in London.He said ‘I won’t have a child dressed in black wanderin’ about like a lost soul,’ he said. ‘It’d make the place sadder than it is. Put color on her.’Mother she said she knew what he meant.Mother always knows what a body means.She doesn’t hold with black hersel’.”"
"“我也讨厌黑色的东西。”玛丽说。","“I hate black things,” said Mary."
"接下来穿衣服的过程让她们两个人都学到了东西。玛莎以前也曾给自己的弟弟妹妹“扣扣子”，但她从没见过像玛丽这样的孩子，站着不动等着别人服侍自己，好像自己没手没脚一样。","The dressing process was one which taught them both something.Martha had “buttoned up” her little sisters and brothers but she had never seen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things for her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own."
"她看到玛丽安静地伸出脚，忍不住说：“你干嘛不自己穿鞋呢？”","“Why doesn’t tha’ put on tha’ own shoes?” she said when Mary quietly held out her foot."
"玛丽瞪着眼睛，回答说：“以前都是奶妈做。这是风俗。”","“My Ayah did it,” answered Mary, staring.“It was the custom.”"
"“这是风俗。”她常说这句话。土著仆人也常常把这句话挂在嘴边。如果你让他们去做一件他们的祖先千年来都没有做过的事情，他们会温和地盯着你说“这不合风俗”，然后这件事就没有商量的余地了。","She said that very often—“It was the custom.”The native servants were always saying it.If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, “It is not the custom” and one knew that was the end of the matter."
"按以前的风俗，玛丽小姐就应该什么都不干，像洋娃娃一样站在那里，等着别人给她穿衣服。但是还未等她收拾停当去吃早饭，她就已经开始怀疑，自己在米瑟斯韦特庄园的日子最终会教会她许多对自己来说全新的东西——例如自己穿鞋穿袜，自己捡掉在地上的东西。而且，如果玛莎是个训练有素、一贯服侍年轻精致的小姐的仆人，她会更加毕恭毕敬，知道诸如给主人梳头、扣靴子的扣子、把东西捡起来放好等都是自己分内的事。但她只是一个朴实的约克郡农家女孩儿，没受过训练，和一群弟弟妹妹在旷野的农舍里长大。他们只知道照顾自己，或是照顾那些比自己还小的、或仍在臂弯里、或正蹒跚学步并随时会摔倒的弟弟妹妹们，从没想过做别的事情。","It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to her—things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking up things she let fall.If Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady’s maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away.She was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things."
"如果玛丽是一个容易取悦的孩子，她可能已经被健谈的玛莎逗笑了。但她只是冷冷地听着，奇怪玛莎怎么能这样无拘无束。开始玛丽对她的讲话毫无兴趣。渐渐地，这个好脾气女孩儿家常的喋喋不休吸引了玛丽的注意。","If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps have laughed at Martha’s readiness to talk, but Mary only listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner.At first she was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in her good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was saying."
"“哦，你真应该都见见他们。”她说，“我们姊妹共十二个，我爸爸每周只有十六个先令。我可以告诉你，妈妈把那钱全部用来给我们买粥喝了。他们整天在旷野上撒欢、玩耍。妈妈说是旷野上的空气把他们喂胖了。她说他们一定和小马驹一样是吃草的。我家迪肯今年十二岁。他有匹小马驹，说是他自己的。”","“Eh! you should see ’em all,” she said.“There’s twelve of us an’ my father only gets sixteen shilling a week.I can tell you my mother’s put to it to get porridge for ’em all.They tumble about on th’ moor an’ play there all day an’ mother says th’ air of th’ moor fattens ’em.She says she believes they eat th’ grass same as th’ wild ponies do.Our Dickon, he’s twelve years old and he’s got a young pony he calls his own.”"
"“他从哪儿弄来这马的？”玛丽问。","“Where did he get it?” asked Mary."
"“他在旷野上找到的。那时小马还小，和它妈妈一起。从那时起迪肯就开始和它做朋友，喂它吃面包，还摘新鲜的草给它。后来小马就喜欢上了他，经常围着他转，还让他骑到自己背上。迪肯是个好孩子，很招动物喜欢。”","“He found it on th’ moor with its mother when it was a little one an’ he began to make friends with it an’ give it bits o’ bread an’ pluck young grass for it.And it got to like him so it follows him about an’ it lets him get on its back.Dickon’s a kind lad an’ animals likes him.”"
"玛丽从未有过属于自己的宠物，也总想着要一个。因此她开始对迪肯产生了一丝兴趣。鉴于她以前从没对自己以外的任何人表示过兴趣，这可是健康情绪的苗头。她走进那间改造成幼儿室的房间，发现和自己睡觉那间屋子很像。墙上灰暗的古画和沉重的橡木椅子都显示着这不是个孩子的房间，而是成年人的。房间中央的桌子上摆放着丰盛的早餐。玛丽的胃口一向很小。她盯着玛莎端上的第一盘食物，表情比漠不关心更糟糕。","Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought she should like one.So she began to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as she had never before been interested in any one but herself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment.When she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in.It was not a child’s room, but a grown-up person’s room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs.A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast.But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate Martha set before her."
"“我不想吃。”她说。","“I don’t want it,” she said."
"“你连燕麦粥都不吃吗？！”玛丽难以置信地喊道。","“Tha’ doesn’t want thy porridge!”Martha exclaimed incredulously."
"“不要。”","“No.”"
"“你都不知道这有多好吃。放点糖浆吧，或者放点白糖。”","“Tha’ doesn’t know how good it is.Put a bit o’ treacle on it or a bit o’ sugar.”"
"“我不想吃。”玛丽重复道。","“I don’t want it,” repeated Mary."
"“天啊！”玛莎说，“我最受不了看着好好的粮食被浪费。要是我们家的孩子在这儿，肯定五分钟之内一扫而光。”","“Eh!” said Martha.“I can’t abide to see good victuals go to waste.If our children was at this table they’d clean it bare in five minutes.”"
"“为什么？”玛丽冷冰冰地问。“你问为什么！”玛莎重复了玛丽的话，“因为他们平时几乎从没填饱过肚子啊。他们像小鹰和小狐狸一样饿。”","“Why?” said Mary coldly.“Why!” echoed Martha.“Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives.They’re as hungry as young hawks an’ foxes.”"
"“我不知道饿是什么感觉。”玛丽回答道，因为无知，所以冷漠。","“I don’t know what it is to be hungry,” said Mary, with the indifference of ignorance."
"玛莎看起来有些愤怒了。","Martha looked indignant."
"“哼，那你最好挨挨饿。我再明白不过了。”她直言不讳地讲，“我对坐在那里对着好面包好肉只是盯着看的人可没有什么耐心。我的天！我倒是希望迪肯、菲利普、简，还有我其他的兄弟姐妹们，都能吃到这些东西呢。”","“Well, it would do thee good to try it.I can see that plain enough,” she said outspokenly.“I’ve no patience with folk as sits an’ just stares at good bread an’ meat.My word! don’t I wish Dickon and Phil an’ Jane an’ th’ rest of ’em had what’s here under their pinafores.”"
"“那怎么不给他们拿去呢？”玛丽建议道。","“Why don’t you take it to them?” suggested Mary."
"“这不是我的。”玛莎坚决地答道，“并且我今天也不休息。和别人一样，我每个月休息一天。休息时我就回家帮妈妈清扫，好让她休息一天。”","“It’s not mine,” answered Martha stoutly.“An’ this isn’t my day out.I get my day out once a month same as th’ rest.Then I go home an’ clean up for mother an’ give her a day’s rest.”"
"玛丽喝了点儿茶，吃了一点儿土司夹果酱。","Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade."
"“你穿暖和些，出去玩儿去吧。”玛莎说，“这对你有好处，你就有胃口吃肉了。”","“You wrap up warm an’ run out an’ play you,” said Martha.“It’ll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat.”"
"玛丽走到窗前。外面有花园、小径、大树。但一切都是那么萧索、呆板。","Mary went to the window.There were gardens and paths and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry."
"“出去？这样的天气出去干什么？”“不出去就只能呆在屋里，呆在屋里有什么可做的呢？”","“Out?Why should I go out on a day like this?”“Well, if tha’ doesn’t go out tha’lt have to stay in, an’ what has tha’ got to do?”"
"玛丽瞥了她一眼。确实没什么事情可做。梅德洛克太太准备幼儿室的时候，根本没考虑到娱乐性。也许出去看看花园什么样子会好点儿。","Mary glanced about her.There was nothing to do.When Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement.Perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like."
"“那谁陪我去呢？”玛丽询问道。","“Who will go with me?” she inquired."
"玛莎盯着她。","Martha stared."
"“你自己去啊。”她回答说，“你要学会自己玩儿。别的没有兄弟姐妹的孩子，就是自己玩儿的。我们家迪肯自己到旷野上一玩儿就是好几个小时。他就是这样才和小马驹交上朋友的。旷野上的绵羊认识他，小鸟也飞来从他的手上吃东西。尽管自己吃的东西也很少，他总是省下一些面包来哄他的小宠物。”","“You’ll go by yourself,” she answered.“You’ll have to learn to play like other children does when they haven’t got sisters and brothers.Our Dickon goes off on th’ moor by himself an’ plays for hours.That’s how he made friends with th’ pony.He’s got sheep on th’ moor that knows him, an’ birds as comes an’ eats out of his hand.However little there is to eat, he always saves a bit o’ his bread to coax his pets.”"
"虽然玛丽自己没有意识到，她是听了迪肯的故事才决定出去走走的。就算外面没有小马驹或绵羊，也会有些小鸟吧。即使和印度的小鸟会有些不一样，但看看它们也会让她开心吧。","It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out, though she was not aware of it.There would be, birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep.They would be different from the birds in India and it might amuse her to look at them."
"玛莎给她找来外套、帽子、结实的小靴子，带领她下楼。","Martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way downstairs."
"“你顺着那条路走过去，就能走到花园。”她指着灌木墙上的一道门对玛丽说，“夏天那里有好多花，不过现在没有开花。”她似乎停顿了一下，补充道：“其中一个花园是锁上的。十年了，没人进去过。”","“If tha’ goes round that way tha’ll come to th’ gardens,” she said, pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery.“There’s lots o’ flowers in summer-time, but there’s nothin’ bloomin’ now.”She seemed to hesitate a second before she added, “One of th’ gardens is locked up.No one has been in it for ten years.”"
"“为什么？”玛丽忍不住问道。这古怪的房子里有一百个上锁的门，现在又多了一道。","“Why?” asked Mary in spite of herself.Here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house."
"“他的妻子突然去世后，克雷文先生就让人把门锁上了。他再也不让任何人进去。那以前是他妻子的花园。他把门锁上，挖了个洞把钥匙埋了进去。哦，梅德洛克太太摇铃了，我得赶紧过去。”","“Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden.He won’t let no one go inside.It was her garden.He locked th’ door an’ dug a hole and buried th’ key.There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell ringing—I must run.”"
"玛莎走后，玛丽沿着那条小道，走向灌木从中的小门。她不由得想起那个十年没人踏入过的花园。她想知道里面是什么样子，是否还有活着的花。穿过灌木门，玛丽发现自己置身于一个大花园里，草坪宽阔，蜿蜒的小路边缘修剪得很整齐。花园里有树木、花床、修剪得奇形怪状的万年青、一个大池塘，中央是一个老旧的灰色喷泉。但是花床光秃秃的，显得萧索，喷泉也没在喷水。这不是那个锁起来的花园。花园怎么能锁起来呢。总是能走进去的啊。","After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery.She could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years.She wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it.When she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders.There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst.But the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing.This was not the garden which was shut up.How could a garden be shut up?You could always walk into a garden."
"她正这么想着，突然发现脚下这条路的尽头似乎有一道长长的墙，上面爬满了常春藤。她对英国还不够熟悉，不知道自己来到了种植蔬菜水果的菜园。她走向那堵墙，发现常春藤中有一扇绿色的门，门打开着。她能够进去。很显然这也不是那个锁上的花园。","She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path she was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was coming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open.This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she could go into it."
"她穿过这扇门，发现里面是一个四周都围着墙的花园。这只是众多有墙的花园之一，这些花园的门似乎都互相相通。她看到另一扇打开的绿门，透过门看到灌木和花床间的小径。花床上种植着冬季蔬菜。果树沿着墙整齐地排列着，有些花床盖着玻璃罩。这光秃秃的地方可真丑陋，玛丽想着，站在那里打量四周。夏天植物变绿了也许会好点儿，不过现在可一点儿都不好看。","She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another.She saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables.Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames.The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her.It might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now."
"不一会儿，一个肩扛铁锹的老人从第二个花园的门走过来。他看到玛丽显然吓了一跳，然后摸了摸自己的鸭舌帽。他的脸苍老乖戾，看到她毫无喜色。但那时候玛丽也对这花园不满意，满脸“倔强异常”的表情，肯定也表现出不乐意看到他。","Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden.He looked startled when he saw Mary, and then touched his cap.He had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her “quite contrary” expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him."
"“这是什么地方？”玛丽问道。","“What is this place?” she asked."
"“这是个菜园。”他回答道。","“One o’ th’ kitchen-gardens,” he answered."
"“那是什么？”玛丽指着另一道绿色的门问。","“What is that?” said Mary, pointing through the other green door."
"“另一个菜园。”他稍作停顿，“墙那边还有一个，另一边是果园。”","“Another of ’em,” shortly.“There’s another on t’other side o’ th’ wall an’ there’s th’ orchard t’other side o’ that.”"
"“我可以进去吗？”玛丽问。","“Can I go in them?” asked Mary."
"“如果你愿意的话。但那里面没什么可看的。”","“If tha’ likes.But there’s nowt to see.”"
"玛丽没回应他。她顺着小径继续走，穿过了第二个绿色的门。她看到了更多的墙，冬季蔬菜和玻璃罩子。但在第二道墙上，有一个绿色的门，是锁着的。也许这门就通向那个十年没人踏足的花园吧。玛丽一向胆大，敢作敢为。她走向那扇绿色的门，扭动把手。她希望门打不开，这就意味着她找到了那个神秘的花园。但门却轻而易举地打开了，她走进去，是个果园。果园四周也都是围墙，树木贴着墙长，光秃秃的果树长在冬天黄褐色的草叶间。这里没有绿门了。玛丽找着绿色的门。当她来到花园北边的尽头，发现围墙延伸到了果园之外，好像围住了那头的另一个地方。她可以看到墙头的树梢。她停下来站定，看到一只胸口鲜红的小鸟停坐在最高的一根树枝上，突然开始了它的冬之歌———好像是因为看到了她，在呼喊她似的。","Mary made no response.She went down the path and through the second green door.There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open.Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years.As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle.She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden—but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard.There were walls all round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to be seen anywhere.Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the upper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side.She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his winter song—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her."
"她停下来听小鸟歌唱。不知怎么的，它那欢欣友好的鸣唱给了玛丽一丝欣喜的感觉。毕竟，不合群的小姑娘也会感到孤单。再加上这紧闭的大房子、广阔光秃的旷野、宽广光秃的花园，一切都让她觉得全世界只剩下自己孤身一人了。她若是个情感丰富的孩子，习惯了被宠爱，可能早已心碎了。但即使她是“玛丽小姐，倔强异常”，即使她孤寂，这个有着亮丽胸脯的小鸟也给她那凄苦的脸上带来了一丝微笑。她听着这小鸟唱歌，直到它飞走。这鸟和印度的鸟不同，玛丽很喜欢它，寻思着什么时候能再见到它。也许它住在那神秘的花园里，知道关于那里的一切。","She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling—even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself.If she had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though she was “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary” she was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face which was almost a smile.She listened to him until he flew away.He was not like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again.Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it."
"也许是因为她实在无所事事吧，她念念不忘那废弃的花园。她对它充满好奇，想看看里面究竟什么样子。为什么克雷文先生把钥匙埋起来了呢？他若是深爱他的妻子，为什么那么憎恨她的花园呢？她想也不知道自己会不会见到他，不过她知道即使见到了，自己也不会喜欢他，他也不会喜欢自己的。她想若是见面了，自己也只会站在那里看着他，什么也不说，虽然她想问他问题都想疯了，想问问他为什么做这么奇怪的事情。","Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much of the deserted garden.She was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like.Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key?If he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden?She wondered if she should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should not like him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing."
"“大家从来不喜欢我，我也不喜欢大家。”她想着，“我绝不会像克劳福德家的孩子那样说话。他们好像总是不停地说啊笑啊，制造噪音。”","“People never like me and I never like people,” she thought.“And I never can talk as the Crawford children could.They were always talking and laughing and making noises.”"
"她想着那只知更鸟，想着它对自己唱歌的样子。她记起了那鸟栖身的树枝，在小径上突然停了下来。","She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at her, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rather suddenly on the path."
"“我敢确定那树就在那个秘密花园里———我很确定。”她说，“那周围有围墙，而且没有门。”","“I believe that tree was in the secret garden—I feel sure it was,” she said.“There was a wall round the place and there was no door.”"
"她返回到第一个菜园，那个老人正在锄地。她走过去站在老人旁边，冷漠地看了他一会儿。他没搭理她，最后她还是开口说话了。","She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found the old man digging there.She went and stood beside him and watched him a few moments in her cold little way.He took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him."
"“我去了其他的花园。”她说。","“I have been into the other gardens,” she said."
"“没人拦着你。”他粗鲁地回答。","“There was nothin’ to prevent thee,” he answered crustily."
"“我还去了果园。”","“I went into the orchard.”"
"“门口没有狗咬你。”他回答道。","“There was no dog at th’ door to bite thee,” he answered."
"“但是那里没有通向另一个花园的门。”玛丽说。","“There was no door there into the other garden,” said Mary."
"“什么花园？”他粗声粗气地说，停下了手里的工作。","“What garden?” he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for a moment."
"“墙另一边的那个花园。”玛丽回答说，“那里有树——我看到了树梢。还有一个胸口鲜红的小鸟坐在树梢上唱歌。”","“The one on the other side of the wall,” answered Mistress Mary.“There are trees there—I saw the tops of them.A bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang.”"
"令她吃惊的是，那个饱经风霜的，乖戾的老脸换了一副表情。微笑缓慢舒展，他像是换了一个人一样。她不由得想，一个人笑起来究竟能看起来和善多少呢，这真奇妙。她以前从来没有想过这些。","To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its expression.A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different.It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled.She had not thought of it before."
"他转向花园靠近果园的那边，开始打起了低柔的口哨。她搞不明白这么粗暴无理的人怎么会发出如此亲切的声音。几乎就在下一刻，更美妙的事情发生了。玛丽听到空中一道急速的声音划过——是那个红胸脯的小鸟向他们飞来，停在花匠脚边的一个大土堆上。","He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to whistle—a low soft whistle.She could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound.Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened.She heard a soft little rushing flight through the air—and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener’s foot."
"“它来了。”老人轻声笑了起来，他用对孩子说话的语气和小鸟说起话来。","“Here he is,” chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as if he were speaking to a child."
"“你跑哪里去了，你这个厚脸皮的小乞丐。”他说，“一直都没有看到你啊。今年这么早就发情了？这也太性急了。”","“Where has tha’ been, tha’ cheeky little beggar?” he said.“I’ve not seen thee before today.Has tha, begun tha’ courtin’ this early in th’ season?Tha’rt too forrad.”"
"小鸟把它那小脑袋偏向一边，用它那温柔明亮、黑色露水般的眼睛抬头看着他。他们很熟，所以它一点儿也不认生。它跳来跳去，轻快地啄着泥土，在里面找种子和虫子吃。那鸟如此漂亮欢欣，看起来像是人类。这让玛丽心中升起了一种奇妙的感觉。它有着丰满的小身子、精致的喙、纤细的腿。","The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop.He seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid.He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects.It actually gave Mary a queer feeling in her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person.He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs."
"“你一叫它就会来的吗？”玛丽用近乎耳语般的声音问道。","“Will he always come when you call him?” she asked almost in a whisper."
"“是的，它一定会来。我从它还是个雏鸟的时候就认识它了。它是从那个花园里的鸟巢里飞出来的。它第一次飞过围墙后因为身体太弱飞不回去了，在这边呆了几天，我们在那几天里变得熟悉了起来。等它飞回去，同一窝的其他幼鸟都飞走了。孤身一人的它又回到我身边。”","“Aye, that he will.I’ve knowed him ever since he was a fledgling.He come out of th’ nest in th’ other garden an’ when first he flew over th’ wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an’ we got friendly.When he went over th’ wall again th’ rest of th’ brood was gone an’ he was lonely an’ he come back to me.”"
"“它是什么鸟？”玛丽问。","“What kind of a bird is he?”Mary asked."
"“你不知道吗？它是红胸脯知更鸟，这可是世上最友好，最好奇的鸟。这种鸟几乎和狗一样友好——当然，如果你知道怎么和它们相处的话。你看它一边啄土，一边不停地打量我们呢。它知道我们在谈论它。”","“Doesn’t tha’ know?He’s a robin redbreast an’ they’re th’ friendliest, curiousest birds alive.They’re almost as friendly as dogs—if you know how to get on with ’em.Watch him peckin’ about there an’ lookin’ round at us now an’ again.He knows we’re talkin’ about him.”"
"这个老家伙真是世上最奇怪的一景。他看着这只身穿鲜红色背心的丰满的小鸟，仿佛既为它骄傲，又无比珍视它。","It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow.He looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him."
"“这可是个骄傲的家伙。”他轻笑，“它喜欢听人谈论自己。它好奇心也很重——我的天啊，它的好奇和爱管闲事可是无人能及。它总来看我在种什么。克雷文老爷从不费神去想的事情，它也全都知道。它可是这花园的管家呢。”","“He’s a conceited one,” he chuckled.“He likes to hear folk talk about him.An’ curious—bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an’ meddlin’.He’s always comin’ to see what I’m plantin’.He knows all th’ things Mester Craven never troubles hissel’ to find out.He’s th’ head gardener, he is.”"
"知更鸟跳来跳去，不时地啄着土，还间或停下来瞅他们一眼。玛丽觉得它那露珠般的眼睛盯着自己，满是好奇。看起来真好像它在试图看穿关于自己的一切。玛丽心中那奇怪的感觉更明显了。“那其他的雏鸟都飞哪里去了？”玛丽问。","The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little.Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity.It really seemed as if he were finding out all about her.The queer feeling in her heart increased.“Where did the rest of the brood fly to?” she asked."
"“没人知道。大鸟把它们赶出鸟巢，让它们自己飞。你还没发现，它们就四散各地了。这鸟很有灵性，它知道自己落单了。”","“There’s no knowin’.The old ones turn ’em out o’ their nest an’ make ’em fly an’ they’re scattered before you know it.This one was a knowin’ one an’ he knew he was lonely.”"
"玛丽小姐朝知更鸟走近了一步，仔细打量它。","Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very hard."
"“我也很孤单。”她说。","“I’m lonely,” she said."
"她从前没有意识到，这正是让自己变得刻薄易怒的原因之一。她好像在与知更鸟的互相注视间，突然明白了。","She had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross.She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin."
"老花匠把秃头上的帽子往后推了推，盯着她看了一阵。","The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute."
"“你就是那个印度来的小孩儿？”他问。","“Art tha’ th’ little wench from India?” he asked."
"玛丽点头。","Mary nodded."
"“难怪你会孤单呢。你在这里会更孤单的。”他说。","“Then no wonder tha’rt lonely.Tha’lt be lonlier before tha’s done,” he said."
"他又开始挖地了，每一下铁锹都深深插进花园肥沃的黑土里，旁边知更鸟还在跳来跳去忙碌着。","He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed."
"“你叫什么名字？”玛丽问。","“What is your name?”Mary inquired."
"他直起身来。","He stood up to answer her."
"“我叫本·韦瑟斯达夫。”他回答道，又生硬地笑了一下，补充道，“我除了和它在一起的时候，也很孤单。”边用手指指向那只小鸟。“我就它一个朋友。”","“Ben Weatherstaff,” he answered, and then he added with a surly chuckle, “I’m lonely mysel’ except when he’s with me,” and he jerked his thumb toward the robin.“He’s th’ only friend I’ve got.”"
"“我一个朋友都没有。”玛丽说，“从来就没有过。印度奶妈不喜欢我，我也从不和别人玩儿。”","“I have no friends at all,” said Mary.“I never had.My Ayah didn’t like me and I never played with any one.”"
"直抒胸臆是典型的约克郡风格。老本是地道的约克郡旷野上的人。","It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and old Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man."
"“那咱俩还挺像。”他说，“咱俩本质相同。我俩长得都不好看，性格和长相一样古怪。我敢保证，咱俩都是一副臭脾气。”","“Tha’ an’ me are a good bit alike,” he said.“We was wove out of th’ same cloth.We’re neither of us good lookin’ an’ we’re both of us as sour as we look.We’ve got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I’ll warrant.”"
"这几句简单的大实话，道出了玛丽性格的本质，不过她从未听人讲过。土著仆人总是对她行额手礼，不管她干了什么，都一味顺从。她从前没怎么在意过自己的外貌。但是现在不得不怀疑自己是否真长得和老本一样难看，是否看起来真和知更鸟来之前的老本那样乖戾。她甚至开始怀疑自己是不是真的有一副“臭脾气”。她觉得不爽。","This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her life.Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did.She had never thought much about her looks, but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came.She actually began to wonder also if she was “nasty tempered.”She felt uncomfortable."
"身边突然响起了如流水般细小的声音，玛丽转过身去。她身旁仅几尺远有一棵小苹果树。知更鸟飞上了一根枝条，开始唱了起来。老本放声大笑起来。","Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round.She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song.Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright."
"“它这是干什么？”玛丽问。","“What did he do that for?” asked Mary."
"“它决定和你交朋友了。”老本回答道，“我赌它一定是迷上你了。”","“He’s made up his mind to make friends with thee,” replied Ben.“Dang me if he hasn’t took a fancy to thee.”"
"“迷上我？”玛丽边说边轻轻走向小树朝上看去。","“To me?” said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly and looked up."
"“你愿意和我交朋友吗？”她像对人说话一样问小鸟。“你愿意吗？”玛丽问小鸟的语气既不是硬邦邦的，也不像她在印度时专横跋扈的样子。她用一种非常轻柔殷切，极具安抚的语调说着。老本惊讶极了，就如同玛丽当时听到他吹口哨一般。","“Would you make friends with me?” she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person.“Would you?”And she did not say it either in her hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she had been when she heard him whistle."
"他喊道：“你怎么说话有点人样了，像个小孩子应有的样子，而不是个严厉的老太婆。你这语气几乎赶上迪肯对他那些旷野上的野东西说话的口气了。”","“Why,” he cried out, “tha’ said that as nice an’ human as if tha’ was a real child instead of a sharp old woman.Tha’ said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild things on th’ moor.”"
"“你认识迪肯？”玛丽忙转过头来。","“Do you know Dickon?”Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry."
"“人人都认识他。迪肯整天到处转悠。就连那些黑莓和石南都认识他。我敢打赌狐狸会带着他看自己的小崽，云雀的窝也不对他保密。”","“Everybody knows him.Dickon’s wanderin’ about everywhere.Th’ very blackberries an’ heather-bells knows him.I warrant th’ foxes shows him where their cubs lies an’ th’ skylarks doesn’t hide their nests from him.”"
"玛丽本想多问些问题的。她对迪肯的好奇心决不亚于对那个废弃的花园的兴趣。但就在这时，唱完歌的知更鸟抖了抖翅膀，展翅飞走了。它拜访结束，要去忙别的事儿了。","Mary would have liked to ask some more questions.She was almost as curious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden.But just that moment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of his wings, spread them and flew away.He had made his visit and had other things to do."
"“它飞过墙去了！”玛丽喊着，边看着它，“它飞进了果园，飞过了另一道墙，飞进没有门的花园里了！”","“He has flown over the wall!”Mary cried out, watching him.“He has flown into the orchard—he has flown across the other wall—into the garden where there is no door!”"
"“它住那里。”老本说，“它就是从那里孵出来的。如果它真的是在求偶的话，那么一定是在讨好一个住在那边老玫瑰树从中的一个雌知更鸟。”","“He lives there,” said old Ben.“He came out o’ th’ egg there.If he’s courtin’, he’s makin’ up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th’ old rose-trees there.”"
"“玫瑰树，”玛丽说，“那边有玫瑰树吗？”","“Rose-trees,” said Mary.“Are there rose-trees?”"
"老本又拿起铁锨，挖了起来。","Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig."
"“十年前有。”他嘟囔着。","“There was ten year’ ago,” he mumbled."
"“我想去看看。”玛丽说，“那个绿门在哪里？什么地方一定有门的。”","“I should like to see them,” said Mary.“Where is the green door?There must be a door somewhere.”"
"本把铁锨戳得更深了，脸上的表情和初见时一样冷漠。","Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked when she first saw him."
"“十年前有，可现在没有了。”他说。","“There was ten year’ ago, but there isn’t now,” he said."
"“没有门！”玛丽喊起来，“一定有的。”“没人找得到，也不关谁的事。别像个多事的村姑一样，没事到处嗅。现在，我必须要干活了。走开自己玩儿去吧。我没时间了。”","“No door!” cried Mary.“There must be.”“None as any one can find, an’ none as is any one’s business.Don’t you be a meddlesome wench an’ poke your nose where it’s no cause to go.Here, I must go on with my work.Get you gone an’ play you.I’ve no more time.”"
"他竟停下来，把铁锨扛在肩上，径直走了，看都没看她一眼，也没说再见。","And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and walked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by."
"第五章 走廊里的哭泣声","CHAPTER V THE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR"
"起初，日子一天天过去。在玛丽看来，都没什么区别。每天早晨，她在挂着壁毯的屋里醒来，看到玛莎跪在壁炉前生火；每天早上，她都在那毫无趣味的幼儿室里吃早餐。吃过早餐，她就凝视着窗外巨大的旷野。那旷野似是像四面八方扩展着，攀向天际。凝视上一会儿，她意识到如果一直不出去，就只能呆在屋里没事可做了——于是她就会出去。她并不知道自己做了最正确的选择。她也不明白，当自己开始快走，甚至沿着通向干道的小径跑起来的时候，她体内缓慢的血流正激荡着，而自己也在与旷野上刮来的风的争斗中逐渐强壮了起来。她跑只是为了暖和起来。她讨厌扑面而来呼啸的风，它像是无形的巨人在背后拖着她。但在不经意之间，这石南间吹来的大股凛冽清新的空气给她肺里注入了某些对她瘦小的身体有好处的物质，给她的两颊抹上了些许红润，令她无神的双眼闪亮了起来。","At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others.Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing—and so she went out.She did not know that this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor.She ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see.But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it."
"连续几天几乎都呆在户外。这天早晨，玛丽醒来终于知道什么是饿了。她坐下来吃早餐，不再鄙夷地看一眼粥然后推开，而是拿起勺子开吃，不停地吃，直到碗见底。","But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty."
"“今天早上吃得不错啊，是不是？”玛莎说。","“Tha’ got on well enough with that this mornin’, didn’t tha’?” said Martha."
"“今天的味道好。”玛丽说道，自己也有点吃惊。","“It tastes nice today,” said Mary, feeling a little surprised her self."
"“是旷野上的空气让你有胃口了。”玛莎回答道，“有胃口就能吃到东西，是你的福气。我们家有十二个孩子，有胃口也没东西填饱肚子。你坚持每天去户外玩儿，慢慢就会长些肉，肤色也不会这么黄了。”","“It’s th’ air of th’ moor that’s givin’ thee stomach for tha’ victuals,” answered Martha.“It’s lucky for thee that tha’s got victuals as well as appetite.There’s been twelve in our cottage as had th’ stomach an’ nothin’ to put in it.You go on playin’ you out o’ doors every day an’ you’ll get some flesh on your bones an’ you won’t be so yeller.”"
"“我出去不是玩儿的。”玛丽说，“我没什么可玩儿的。”","“I don’t play,” said Mary.“I have nothing to play with.”"
"“没有可玩儿的！”玛莎惊叹起来，“我们的孩子都玩树枝和石头。他们就到处乱跑，乱叫，到处看看。”玛丽不叫喊，但她会到处看看。除了这就没别的可做的了。她绕着花园转啊转，在花园里的小径上游荡。有时候她去找本·韦瑟斯达夫，不过好几次他都在工作，不是忙得看都不看她一眼，就是摆一副臭脸。有一次她正朝他走过去，他就拿起铁锨转身走了，好像是故意的一样。","“Nothin’ to play with!” exclaimed Martha.“Our children plays with sticks and stones.They just runs about an’ shouts an’ looks at things.”Mary did not shout, but she looked at things.There was nothing else to do.She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park.Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly.Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose."
"有一个地方她去的最多。是墙围着的花园外的长廊。长廊两旁是光秃秃的花床，墙上长满了茂密的常春藤。墙上有一处攀爬的绿叶比别的地方都茂密。看起来这是一片被忽略很久的地方。其他地方都修剪过，整理得很整齐，唯独低的这一头完全没有修剪过。","One place she went to oftener than to any other.It was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them.There were bare flower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly.There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere.It seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected.The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all."
"和本·韦瑟斯达夫聊天后又过了几天，玛丽停下来注意到了这点，很奇怪为什么会这样。她刚停下来，抬头看着一簇长长的常春藤在风中摇摆，突然看到一抹猩红，听到一声响亮短促的鸟鸣——就在那墙头，本·韦瑟斯达夫的红胸脯知更鸟正停驻在那里，小脑袋歪向一边，俯身看着她。","A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so.She had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, forward perched Ben Weatherstaff’s robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her with his small head on one side."
"“噢！”她喊了出来，“是你吗——是你吗？”她就那么和它讲话，仿佛它一定能听懂她的话，也一定会回答她。一切都那么自然，一点儿也不突兀。","“Oh!” she cried out, “is it you—is it you?”And it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure that he would understand and answer her."
"它确实回答了。它唧唧喳喳地叫着，在墙头跳来跳去，像是在告诉她各种事情。虽然它并不是用言语在表达，但玛丽觉得自己仿佛懂它的意思。玛丽觉得它好像是在说：","He did answer.He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things.It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words.It was as if he said:"
"“早上好！多和煦的风！多温暖的太阳！一切都如此美好！让我们一同跳跃，一同歌唱吧。来吧！动起来吧！”","“Good morning!Isn’t the wind nice?Isn’t the sun nice?Isn’t everything nice?Let us both chirp and hop and twitter.Come on!Come on!”"
"玛丽笑了起来，小鸟在墙头跳来跳去，她就跟在后面跑。她这个可怜的、瘦小、蜡黄、丑丑的小东西仿佛在某一刻也漂亮了起来。","Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the wall she ran after him.Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary—she actually looked almost pretty for a moment."
"“我喜欢你！我喜欢你！”她顺着长廊边跑边喊，学小鸟鸣叫，还试着打口哨，却怎么也吹不出来。不过知更鸟却好像很满意，用鸣叫声和口哨回应她。最后知更鸟展开翅膀，一跃飞上了一棵树的树顶，停在那里放声唱了起来。这让玛丽想起第一次见到它的场景。它当时在一棵树顶摇摆，而自己站在果园里。此刻自己站在果园的另一端，墙外的小径上——墙比树低多了，而里面是同一棵树。","“I like you!I like you!” she cried out, pattering down the walk; and she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do in the least.But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her.At last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him.He had been swinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard.Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall—much lower down—and there was the same tree inside."
"“它住在那个没人能进去的花园里。”她自言自语道，“那个没门的花园。它住在那里面。我要是能看看里面什么样子该有多好啊！”","“It’s in the garden no one can go into,” she said to herself.“It’s the garden without a door.He lives in there.How I wish I could see what it is like!”"
"她顺小径往前，跑到了第一天早上进去过的绿门前。接着她又顺着小径穿过另一道门，进入果园。站定抬头看，墙那边是那棵树，而知更鸟则刚刚唱完歌，开始用喙梳理羽毛。","She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning.Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his song and, beginning to preen his feathers with his beak."
"“就是这个花园。”她说，“我确定就是这个。”","“It is the garden,” she said.“I am sure it is.”"
"她围着花园转了一圈，仔细近看了花园围墙的那一面，还是没有任何新发现——墙上根本没门。她接着又一次穿过菜园，来到那条覆盖着常青藤的长长的围墙外的小径。走到小径的尽头，却还是没有找到门。她又走到另一头看了看，也没有门。","She walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall, but she only found what she had found before—that there was no door in it.Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it and looked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the other end, looking again, but there was no door."
"“这可真怪。”她说，“本·韦瑟斯达夫说没门，也确实没有。但十年前一定有门，克雷文先生还埋过钥匙的。”","“It’s very queer,” she said.“Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door and there is no door.But there must have been one ten years ago, because Mr. Craven buried the key.”"
"这事给了她很大的想象空间。她的好奇心被大大唤醒，也开始觉得来到米瑟斯韦特庄园没那么糟糕了。在印度的时候，她总是感到热，常常精神倦怠无暇他顾。事实上，旷野上的新鲜空气正慢慢吹去她年轻头脑里的蜘蛛网，并一点点唤醒她。","This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor.In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything.The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little."
"她几乎整日都呆在户外，晚上坐下来吃晚餐的时候，常常饥肠辘辘，虽然困倦却通体顺畅。玛莎和她闲聊她也不觉得烦躁。她觉得自己好像很喜欢听她说话。最后，她决定问玛莎一个问题。她吃完晚饭，坐在火炉前的石南毯子上后这才开始问。","She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable.She did not feel cross when Martha chattered away.She felt as if she rather liked to hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question.She asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the hearth-rug before the fire."
"“克雷文先生为什么不喜欢那个花园呢？”她问。","“Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?” she said."
"是她让玛莎留下来的，而玛莎也非常乐意。玛莎很年轻，习惯了农舍里挤满兄弟姐妹。她觉得楼下宽敞的仆人大厅非常乏味。大厅里脚夫和贴身女佣们会取笑她的约克郡口音，当她是无关紧要的小鬼，还坐在那里窃窃私语。玛莎很健谈，而这个在印度呆过，被“黑人”服侍过的古怪的孩子，足够满足她的好奇心了。","She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she found it dull in the great servants’ hall downstairs where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech and looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves.Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by “blacks,” was novelty enough to attract her."
"她不用玛丽招呼，就径自坐在了石南毯子上。","She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked."
"“你还在想着那个花园吗？”她说，“我就知道你会这样。我最开始听说的时候也是这样。”","“Art tha’ thinkin’ about that garden yet?” she said.“I knew tha’ would.That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.”"
"“他为什么讨厌那个花园？”玛丽追问道。","“Why did he hate it?”Mary persisted."
"玛莎把脚缩起来，让自己更舒服些。","Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable."
"“你听这房子周围呜啸的风声。”她说，“今天晚上你要是出去旷野上，连站都站不稳。”","“Listen to th’ wind wutherin’ round the house,” she said.“You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight.”"
"玛丽不懂玛莎口中的“呜啸”是什么意思。直到她听到了风声，才明白了。一定是那空洞的，战栗般的呼啸声。它绕着屋子一圈圈狂奔，像是人们看不到的巨人在猛烈撞击着墙和窗，试图闯进来。但人们知道他是进不来的。因此，屋里的人坐在红红的炉火前，感到温暖而安全。","Mary did not know what “wutherin’” meant until she listened, and then she understood.It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire."
"“可他为什么如此厌恶这个花园呢？”她听完风声，继续问。她想看看玛莎知不知道。","“But why did he hate it so?” she asked, after she had listened.She intended to know if Martha did."
"这时玛莎才把自己的情报储备抖落了出来。","Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge."
"“说真的，”她说，“梅德洛克太太说不能讲的。这个地方很多事情都不能讲。这是克雷文先生的命令。他说他自己的事情不关我们仆人的事。但要不是那个花园，他现在可不是这样。那是他太太的花园，是他们刚结婚的时候克雷文太太造的。她非常喜欢那个花园，都是他们自己照料里面的花草。从没有园丁进去过。他们俩常常进去后把门锁上，在里面一呆就是好几个小时，或读书或聊天。她有点儿像个小女孩儿。那里面有棵老树，树枝弯下来，像是个座位。她让玫瑰长满树枝，自己就坐在那上面。但有一天她坐在上面的时候，树枝断了。她摔到了地上，伤得很严重，第二天就死掉了。医生一度认为克雷文先生也会发疯然后死掉。这就是他厌恶那个花园的原因。从那以后就没有人进去过，他也不允许任何人谈论这件事。”","“Mind,” she said, “Mrs. Medlock said it’s not to be talked about.There’s lots o’ things in this place that’s not to be talked over.That’s Mr. Craven’s orders.His troubles are none servants’ business, he says.But for th’ garden he wouldn’t be like he is.It was Mrs. Craven’s garden that she had made when first they were married an’ she just loved it, an’ they used to ‘tend the flowers themselves.An’ none o’ th’ gardeners was ever let to go in.Him an’ her used to go in an’ shut th’ door an’ stay there hours an’ hours, readin’ and talkin’.An’ she was just a bit of a girl an’ there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it.An’ she made roses grow over it an’ she used to sit there.But one day when she was sittin’ there th’ branch broke an’ she fell on th’ ground an’ was hurt so bad that next day she died.Th’ doctors thought he’d go out o’ his mind an’ die, too.That’s why he hates it.No one’s never gone in since, an’ he won’t let any one talk about it.”"
"玛丽没有再问任何问题。她看着红色的炉火，听着呼啸的风声。风声好像更劲了。就在那时，一件对她来说很好的事情发生了。事实上，自从她来到米瑟斯韦特庄园，已经发生了四件对她来说的好事了：她觉得自己好像了解一只知更鸟，而那鸟也懂她；她在风中奔跑，直到血液变暖；她生平第一次有了健康的饥饿感；她也第一次明白了什么是同情别人。","Mary did not ask any more questions.She looked at the red fire and listened to the wind “wutherin’.”It seemed to be “wutherin’” louder than ever.At that moment a very good thing was happening to her.Four good things had happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor.She had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood her; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm; she had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she had found out what it was to be sorry for some one."
"但她在风声中渐渐听到其他什么声音。她不知道那是什么声音，因为最开始她几乎无法把那声音和风声区分开来。那是个奇怪的声音——好像是哪里有个小孩儿在哭。有时这风听起来就像是小孩儿的哭声，但是这次玛丽非常确定这声音在房子里而不在外面。虽然离得很远，但在房子里。她转身看着玛莎。","But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else.She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself.It was a curious sound—it seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere.Sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house, not outside it.It was far away, but it was inside.She turned round and looked at Martha."
"“你听见有人在哭吗？”她说。","“Do you hear any one crying?” she said."
"玛莎猛然间一片茫然。","Martha suddenly looked confused."
"“没有啊。”她回答，“是风的声音。有时候风声听起来就像是在旷野上迷路的人的嚎哭。风能弄出各种声音来。”","“No,” she answered.“It’s th’ wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if some one was lost on th’ moor an’ wailin’. It’s got all sorts o’ sounds.”"
"“但是你听，”玛丽说，“这明明就在屋子里——在某个长走廊的尽头。”","“But listen,” said Mary. “It’s in the house—down one of those long corridors.”"
"就在那时，一定是楼下哪扇门被打开了，一道猛烈的穿堂风沿着走道吹来，她们房间的门被砰地吹开。玛丽和玛莎两人都跳了起来，灯被吹灭了，哭泣声从远处的走廊飘了过来，听得比任何时候都清楚。","And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere downstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than ever."
"“你听！”玛丽说，“我都跟你说过了！就是有人在哭——而且不是大人。”","“There!” said Mary.“I told you so!It is some one crying—and it isn’t a grown-up person.”"
"玛莎跑过去关上门，扭动钥匙。门还没锁上，她们俩就都听到远处哪里走廊的门“砰”地撞上了。然后一切都安静了下来，连那呼啸的风声都停了片刻。","Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased “wutherin’” for a few moments."
"“那是风。”玛莎生硬地说，“若不是风，就是小贝蒂·贝特沃思，那个在后厨帮忙的仆人。她今天一整天都牙疼。”","“It was th’ wind,” said Martha stubbornly.“An’ if it wasn’t, it was little Betty Butterworth, th’ scullery-maid.She’s had th’ toothache all day.”"
"但她那担忧的、不自在的举止神态让玛丽更用力地盯着她看。玛丽觉得她在说谎。","But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Mary stare very hard at her.She did not believe she was speaking the truth."
"第六章 “有人在哭——真的！”","CHAPTER VI “THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING—THERE WAS!”"
"第二天又是大雨滂沱。玛丽透过窗户朝外看，整个旷野都笼罩在一片灰蒙蒙的云霭中。今天没法出去了。","The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud.There could be no going out today."
"“下这么大雨的时候，你们在农舍里都做些什么？”玛丽问玛莎。","“What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?” she asked Martha."
"“基本就是做到尽量不要踩到别人。”玛莎回答道，“哎，那时确实显得人很多。我妈妈脾气很好，但也不免担心。最大的孩子就出去到牛棚里玩儿。迪肯不怕湿。他照样出去，好像外面阳光普照一样。他说雨天能看到和晴天时不一样的东西。有一次他在狐狸洞里发现了一只被淹了一半的小狐狸崽，把它放在胸口的衣服里暖着，带了回来。不远处母狐狸已经死了，整个洞也被淹了，其他幼仔都死掉了。现在他把它养在家里。还有一次他发现了一只快要淹死的小母牛，带回家驯养了。因为它很黑，迪肯给它起名叫做烟灰。现在烟灰整天围在他身边又蹦又跳的。”","“Try to keep from under each other’s feet mostly,” Martha answered.“Eh! there does seem a lot of us then.Mother’s a good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered.The biggest ones goes out in th’ cow-shed and plays there.Dickon he doesn’t mind th’ wet.He goes out just th’ same as if th’ sun was shinin’.He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn’t show when it’s fair weather.He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th’ bosom of his shirt to keep it warm.Its mother had been killed nearby an’ th’ hole was swum out an’ th’ rest o’ th’ litter was dead.He’s got it at home now.He found a half-drowned young crow another time an’ he brought it home, too, an’ tamed it.It’s named Soot because it’s so black, an’ it hops an’ flies about with him everywhere.”"
"渐渐地，玛丽已经忘记去厌恶玛莎絮絮叨叨的老生常谈了。她甚至开始觉得玛莎的闲聊很有趣，要是玛莎停下来或走开，还会觉得可惜。她在印度时奶妈讲的故事和玛莎的故事完全不同。玛莎的故事里有一个旷野上的农舍，农舍里十四个人住在四个小房间里，吃的东西永远不够。孩子们到处跌跌撞撞，自得其乐，像是一窝粗放的，好脾气的牧羊犬幼仔。玛丽对玛莎的妈妈和迪肯最感兴趣。每当玛莎讲起她“妈妈”讲的故事或做的事情，听起来总是那么舒服。","The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha’s familiar talk.She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away.The stories she had been told by her Ayah when she lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat.The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies.Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon.When Martha told stories of what “mother” said or did they always sounded comfortable."
"“要是我也有只乌鸦或狐狸幼仔，我就能和它玩了。”玛丽说，“可我什么也没有。”","“If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,” said Mary.“But I have nothing.”"
"玛莎看起来很困惑。","Martha looked perplexed."
"“你会编织吗？”她问。","“Can tha’ knit?” she asked."
"“不会。”玛丽回答。","“No,” answered Mary."
"“那你会缝东西吗？”","“Can tha’ sew?”"
"“也不会。”","“No.”"
"“那你识字吗？”","“Can tha’ read?”"
"“我识字。”","“Yes.”"
"“那你为什么不读些书，学点儿拼写呢？你年纪也不小了，可以读好些书了。”","“Then why doesn’t tha, read somethin’, or learn a bit o’ spellin’?Tha’st old enough to be learnin’ thy book a good bit now.”"
"“我没书。”玛丽说，“我的书都留在印度了。”","“I haven’t any books,” said Mary.“Those I had were left in India.”"
"“那真可惜。”玛莎说，“要是梅德洛克太太让你进书房就好了，那儿有成千上万的书呢。”","“That’s a pity,” said Martha.“If Mrs. Medlock’d let thee go into th’ library, there’s thousands o’ books there.”"
"玛丽没有问玛莎书房在哪里，因为她突然间有了个新点子。她决定自己去找书房。梅德洛克太太是否允许根本难不倒她。梅德洛克太太好像什么时候都呆在楼下她那舒适的起居室里，那是专门给管家用的。在这个古怪的地方几乎不见什么人影。事实上这里除了仆人也没什么人。主人一走，他们更是在楼下过着奢侈的生活。楼下有个巨大的厨房，到处挂着锃亮的铜器和铅锡合金的器具。宽敞的仆人大厅，一天供应四五顿丰盛的饭菜。要是梅德洛克太太不出现，还常常充斥着嬉笑玩耍声。","Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea.She made up her mind to go and find it herself.She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock.Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper’s sitting-room downstairs.In this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all.In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants’ hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way."
"玛丽的每餐饭都按时端来，由玛莎服侍着，其他人则懒得去关心她一丝一毫。梅德洛克太太每一两天来看看她，但是没人问她都做了些什么，或者告诉她可以干点儿什么。她猜想也许在英国就是这样对待小孩儿的吧。在印度，服侍她的奶妈随时随地都跟着她，尽心尽力服侍她。她常常被跟得很烦。现在没人跟着她，她也开始学着自己穿衣服了。因为每当她想让玛莎把衣服递给她帮她穿上时，玛莎看她的表情就好像她认为自己是个傻瓜。","Mary’s meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no one troubled themselves about her in the least.Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do.She supposed that perhaps this was the English way of treating children.In India she had always been attended by her Ayah, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot.She had often been tired of her company.Now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on."
"有一次玛丽站在那里等她给自己戴手套，“你手脚不灵便吗？”玛莎说，“我们家苏珊·安可比你灵巧多了，她才四岁。你有时候看起来还真是脑子不够用啊。”","“Hasn’t tha’ got good sense?” she said once, when Mary had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her.“Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an’ she’s only four year’ old.Sometimes tha’ looks fair soft in th’ head.”"
"听了这话，玛丽一张臭脸摆了一小时之久，不过这也让她思考了几样全新的事情。","Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things."
"这天早晨，玛莎把石南毯最后清扫完毕下楼去了。玛丽在窗前站了十分钟。她在琢磨自己听到有个书房时想到的那个新点子。她对书房本身倒不是非常在意，因为她也没读过几本书。但提到书房就让她想起了那一百间锁上的屋子。她很想知道它们是否真的全都锁上了，要是她能进去其中任何一间，会发现什么呢？是不是真有一百间？为什么不亲自去看看，数数到底有多少扇门？反正她今早也没法出去，这样也算是有点儿事情做。没人教过她做事情需要得到准许，她也从不知道“批准”是什么概念。因此，即使她见到梅德洛克太太，也并不觉得有必要问问她自己是否可以在房子里到处走。","She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs.She was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library.She did not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors.She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them.Were there a hundred really?Why shouldn’t she go and see how many doors she could count?It would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out.She had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk about the house, even if she had seen her."
"她打开房门走上走廊，开始游荡。走廊很长，有很多分岔通向别的走廊。她走上一小段上坡的台阶，台阶又搭着另外一段。她路过一道道门，墙上挂着一幅幅画。有些画是阴暗、神秘的风景，但最多的还是男男女女的肖像画，画中人穿着绸子和天鹅绒质地的、古怪华丽的服装。她发觉自己置身于一个长长的画廊，墙上挂满了这样的肖像画。她从没想到一座房子里能有这么多画像。她慢慢走下去，盯着那些画上的脸孔，那些脸孔好像也盯着她看。她觉得他们一定在想这个印度来的小女孩儿在他们的房子里干什么。有些是小孩儿的画像——小女孩儿穿着厚厚的、拖至脚边的缎质蓬蓬裙；男孩儿留着长发，衣服上有蓬蓬袖和蕾丝衣领，要不就穿着伊丽莎白式大环状领的衣服。她不时地停下来看这些小孩儿，很好奇他们叫什么名字，都去哪里了，为什么穿着这么奇怪的衣服。有一个小女孩儿很像她自己，面目拘谨，长相普通。她穿着一件绿色锦缎的裙子，手指上停着一只绿色的鹦鹉。她眼神犀利，充满好奇。","She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she began her wanderings.It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again.There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls.Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet.She found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits.She had never thought there could be so many in any house.She walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her.She felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house.Some were pictures of children—little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks.She always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes.There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself.She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger.Her eyes had a sharp, curious look."
"“你现在住在哪里？”玛丽大声问，“你要是住在这里就好了。”","“Where do you live now?” said Mary aloud to her.“I wish you were here.”"
"其他小女孩儿肯定没有过这么奇怪的早上。这座巨大而凌乱的大房子里好像空无一人，只除了小小的她形单影只，跑上跑下穿过宽宽窄窄的走廊过道。这些过道好像除了她，也无人踏足过一样。既然当时修了这么多间房子，就一定有人住过。但房子现在貌似都空着，这让她觉得难以置信。","Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning.It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked.Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true."
"她走到二层，才想起来扭动门上的把手。正如梅德洛克太太说过的，门都锁着。最后，她把手放在一个门的把手上扭动了一下。把手毫不费力地转了起来。玛丽一时被吓坏了。她推门，门缓慢而厚重地打开了。门很厚重，里面是一间大卧室。墙上挂着刺绣挂饰，房间四处摆放着她在印度见过的那种有镶嵌的家具。一扇宽阔的窗户镶着铅制窗格，窗户面向外面的旷野；壁炉架上是那个面目严肃、样子普通的小女孩儿的又一幅画像。那女孩儿好像在用更加好奇的眼神盯着她。","It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door.All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it.She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened.It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom.There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room.A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever."
"“也许这儿以前是她的卧室。”玛丽自言自语，“她看得我浑身不自在。”","“Perhaps she slept here once,” said Mary.“She stares at me so that she makes me feel queer.”"
"然后她打开了一个又一个门。她看了很多房间，觉得特别累。她想这里一定有一百个房间，虽然自己没数过。每个房间里挂的不是古画就是旧挂毯，挂毯上面织着奇怪的景象。几乎每间房子里都有精致的家具和装饰。","After that she opened more doors and more.She saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she had not counted them.In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them.There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them."
"有个房间看起来像是女士的起居室，里面的挂饰全是刺绣天鹅绒，还有个橱柜，里面有大约一百只象牙做的小象。小象大小不一，有些有赶象人，有些背上还驮着轿子。有些要比其他的大得多，有些则小得如同大象宝宝。玛丽在印度见过象牙雕刻，她对大象无所不知。她打开橱柜门，站在脚凳上，对着这些小象把玩了好一阵子。等她玩累了，就把小象按顺序放好，关上了橱柜的门。","In one room, which looked like a lady’s sitting-room, the hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory.They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs.Some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies.Mary had seen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants.She opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time.When she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet."
"她顺着长廊游荡过来，又进了这么多间空屋子，还一直没见到活物呢。但在这个屋里她看到了。她刚关好橱柜门，就听到了非常细碎的窸窣声。她跳了起来，四周查看火炉旁的沙发，她觉得声音好像是从那边传来的。沙发一角有一个靠垫，靠垫的天鹅绒罩子上有个洞，洞里探出一丁点儿个小脑袋和一双露出惊恐神色的眼睛。","In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something.Just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come.In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it."
"玛丽蹑手蹑脚爬过去看个究竟。这双明亮的眼睛属于一只小灰鼠。小灰鼠已经在靠垫上咬出了个洞，做了个舒服的窝。六只幼鼠依偎着，睡在她身旁。如果这上百间屋子里再无其他活物的话，那至少还有这七只老鼠，他们看起来一点儿也不孤单。","Mary crept softly across the room to look.The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there.Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her.If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all."
"“要不是它们受了如此惊吓，我就把它们带回去。”玛丽自言自语道。","“If they wouldn’t be so frightened I would take them back with me,” said Mary."
"她游荡得够远了，累得没有力气走更远，于是开始打道回府。有两三次她拐错走廊迷了路，不得不上下乱窜，直到走回对的走廊。最后她终于回到自己那一层，虽然她离自己的房间还有一段距离，也并不知道自己的确切位置。","She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther, and she turned back.Two or three times she lost her way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she found the right one; but at last she reached her own floor again, though she was some distance from her own room and did not know exactly where she was."
"“我想我又拐错了。”她说，一动不动站在像是一个短过道的尽头处，过道两边的墙上有挂毯。“我不知道该走哪条路了。一切都好安静啊！”","“I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,” she said, standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall.“I don’t know which way to go.How still everything is!”"
"就在她站在那里，刚刚感叹一切多安静的时候，这安静被打破了。又是哭声，但和她前一晚听到的不大一样。只是短短的一声，焦躁的、孩子气的哀号，穿过墙显得压抑而低沉。","It was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that the stillness was broken by a sound.It was another cry, but not quite like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls."
"“这声音更近了。”玛丽说，心跳加速，“这是哭声。”","“It’s nearer than it was,” said Mary, her heart beating rather faster.“And it is crying.”"
"她的手不经意碰触到身旁的挂毯，立刻大吃一惊，迅速弹了回来。挂毯后面是一道门。门打开来，走廊的另一段展现在玛丽面前。梅德洛克太太正从里面走来，手里拿了她那串钥匙，脸上一副生气的表情。","She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then sprang back, feeling quite startled.The tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face."
"“你在这儿做什么？”她说，说完架着玛丽的胳膊欲把她拖走，“我跟你说过什么来着？”","“What are you doing here?” she said, and she took Mary by the arm and pulled her away.“What did I tell you?”"
"“我拐错弯了。”玛丽解释着，“我不知道走哪条路，我听到有人在哭。”如果说此刻她很恨梅德洛克太太的话，那么接下来梅德洛克太太的话则让她更加憎恨她了。","“I turned round the wrong corner,” explained Mary.“I didn’t know which way to go and I heard some one crying.”She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated her more the next."
"“你根本没有听到那种声音。”这个管家婆说道，“你顺着原路赶紧回你的幼儿室去，不然我就掴你耳光。”","“You didn’t hear anything of the sort,” said the housekeeper.“You come along back to your own nursery or I’ll box your ears.”"
"她拽着玛丽的胳膊，半推半拉地拖着她走过一个个走廊，上上下下，直到回到玛丽的房门口，把她推了进去。","And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one passage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own room."
"“现在，”她说，“你就呆在让你呆的地方，不然就把你锁起来。主人最好赶紧给你找个家庭教师，他说过的。你就得找个人盯紧点儿。我事情已经够多的了。”","“Now,” she said, “you stay where you’re told to stay or you’ll find yourself locked up.The master had better get you a governess, same as he said he would.You’re one that needs some one to look sharp after you.I’ve got enough to do.”"
"梅德洛克太太出去时把门重重摔上。玛丽走到石南毯子那里坐了下来，小脸气得惨白。她没哭，但气得咬牙切齿。","She went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary went and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage.She did not cry, but ground her teeth."
"“有人在哭——明明就有——就是有人在哭！”她自言自语道。","“There was some one crying—there was—there was!” she said to herself."
"她已经听到过两次了，总有一天她要探出个究竟。今天早上收获已经颇丰了。她觉得自己似乎在进行一个长途旅行，而她总能找到自娱自乐的东西，比方说她早上玩过的象牙雕的大象，见到的灰色老鼠，和它那些在天鹅绒靠垫做成的窝里的鼠宝宝们。","She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out.She had found out a great deal this morning.She felt as if she had been on a long journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion."
"第七章 花园的钥匙","CHAPTER VII THE KEY TO THE GARDEN"
"又过了两天，玛丽早晨一睁开眼，立刻从床上笔直地坐了起来，叫来玛莎。","Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha."
"“快看旷野！快看旷野！”","“Look at the moor! Look at the moor!”"
"暴风雨停了，一夜的风吹散了灰色的雾霭和云翳。风也停了，明亮的蓝色天幕拱跨原野，显得深邃悠远。玛丽做梦都没有见过这么蓝的天。印度的天空是炙热的。而这里的天空蓝得深邃凉爽，闪亮如无底的湖水一般。在那高高的蓝色里，这里那里还漂浮着朵朵小片云彩，像雪白的羊毛一样。辽阔的旷野现在也是一片温柔的蓝色，而不是阴郁的黑紫色或凄凉的灰色。","The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind.The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland.Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue.In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece.The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray."
"“啊，”玛莎欢欣地笑了起来，“暴雨停了。每年这个时候都是这样。雨在晚上停下来，装作好像从来没来过，也不会再来的样子。这是因为春天已经在路上了。虽然还得一阵子，但是快来了。”","“Aye,” said Martha with a cheerful grin.“Th’ storm’s over for a bit.It does like this at this time o’ th’ year.It goes off in a night like it was pretendin’ it had never been here an’ never meant to come again.That’s because th’ springtime’s on its way.It’s a long way off yet, but it’s comin’.”"
"“我原以为也许英格兰总是阴雨连连的呢。”玛丽说。","“I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,” Mary said."
"“哦，不是！”玛莎在一堆黑色铅刷子中间坐起来，“根本某这样啊！”","“Eh! no!” said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes.“Nowt o’ th’ soart!”"
"“你说什么？”玛丽很吃惊。在印度的时候，土著人也讲只有很少人听得懂的各种方言，所以玛丽听到玛莎讲自己不懂的词，也不觉得奇怪。","“What does that mean?” asked Mary seriously.In India the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not surprised when Martha used words she did not know."
"像第一天早晨那样，玛莎笑了起来。","Martha laughed as she had done the first morning."
"“看看我，”她说，“我又说约克郡话了。约克郡方言发音很宽。梅德洛克太太让我不能讲的。‘根本某这样’的意思是‘根本不是这样的，’”她慢慢地、认真地说，“这么说好费劲啊。天晴的时候，约克郡是世界上最晴朗的地方。我告诉过你，你慢慢会爱上旷野的。再等等，你就能看到金色的金雀花、石南花——全是紫色的铃铛，成百上千的蝴蝶挥舞着翅膀、蜜蜂嗡嗡、云雀一飞冲天，唱着歌曲。那时，太阳一出来你就想去旷野上，像迪肯一样整天都呆在外面。”“我可以去那里吗？”玛丽若有所思地问道，透过窗户看向远方的蓝色。那蓝色是如此清新、辽阔、奇妙，像是天堂般的色彩。","“There now,” she said.“I’ve talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock said I mustn’t.‘Nowt o’ th’ soart’ means ‘nothin’-of-the-sort,’” slowly and carefully, “but it takes so long to say it.Yorkshire’s th’ sunniest place on earth when it is sunny.I told thee tha’d like th’ moor after a bit.Just you wait till you see th’ gold-colored gorse blossoms an’ th’ blossoms o’ th’ broom, an’ th’ heather flowerin’, all purple bells, an’ hundreds o’ butterflies flutterin’ an’ bees hummin’ an’ skylarks soarin’ up an’ singin’.You’ll want to get out on it as sunrise an’ live out on it all day like Dickon does.”“Could I ever get there?” asked Mary wistfully, looking through her window at the far-off blue.It was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color."
"“我不知道。”玛莎回答道，“在我看来，你从生下来就没怎么用过腿。你走不了五英里的吧。这儿离我家的小屋大概五英里。”","“I don’t know,” answered Martha.“Tha’s never used tha’ legs since tha’ was born, it seems to me.Tha’ couldn’t walk five mile.It’s five mile to our cottage.”"
"“我很想看看你家的小屋。”","“I should like to see your cottage.”"
"玛莎好奇地盯着她看了一阵，又拿起抛光刷子，开始擦壁炉架了。她开始觉得，这张苍白普通的小脸，看起来不像她第一天早晨见到的那样阴郁别扭了。这张脸看起来有一点点像苏珊·安非常想要什么东西时的表情。","Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again.She was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it.It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann’s when she wanted something very much."
"“我去问问我妈妈。”她说，“我妈妈是那种人，她总能想到解决问题的办法。今天我放假，我要回家呢。啊！我好高兴啊。梅德洛克太太很想我妈妈。也许她能和我妈妈聊聊。”","“I’ll ask my mother about it,” she said.“She’s one o’ them that nearly always sees a way to do things.It’s my day out today an’ I’m goin’ home. Eh!I am glad.Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o’ mother.Perhaps she could talk to her.”"
"“我喜欢你妈妈。”玛丽说。","“I like your mother,” said Mary."
"“我就知道你会喜欢她。”玛莎边擦，边表示认同。","“I should think tha’ did,” agreed Martha, polishing away."
"“我从没见过她呢。”玛丽说。","“I’ve never seen her,” said Mary."
"“是啊，你还没见过她。”玛莎回答道。","“No, tha’ hasn’t,” replied Martha."
"她又坐了起来，用手背揉了揉鼻头，似是迷惑了一下，但最后想清楚了。","She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite positively."
"“是的，她既明事理又勤快，性格好，爱干净。无论见没见过她，人们都忍不住会喜欢上她的。轮到我的外出日可以回家看妈妈时，我穿过旷野的时候高兴得都能跳起来。”","“Well, she’s that sensible an’ hard workin’ an’ goodnatured an’ clean that no one could help likin’ her whether they’d seen her or not.When I’m goin’ home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I’m crossin’ the moor.”"
"“我喜欢迪肯。”玛丽补充道，“我也从没见过他。”","“I like Dickon,” added Mary.“And I’ve never seen him.”"
"“哦，”玛莎生硬地说，“我不是告诉过你嘛，每只小鸟都喜欢他，还有那些兔子、野绵羊、小马、狐狸什么的。我在想，”玛莎若有所思地盯着玛丽，“迪肯会怎么看你呢？”","“Well,” said Martha stoutly, “I’ve told thee that th’ very birds likes him an’ th’ rabbits an’ wild sheep an’ ponies, an’ th’ foxes themselves.I wonder,” staring at her reflectively, “what Dickon would think of thee?”"
"“他不会喜欢我的。”玛丽用她那冷漠刻板的语气说，“没人会喜欢我的。”","“He wouldn’t like me,” said Mary in her stiff, cold little way.“No one does.”"
"玛莎好像又在想些什么了。","Martha looked reflective again."
"“那你喜欢你自己吗？”玛莎询问道，好像她真的非常想知道答案。","“How does tha’ like thysel’?” she inquired, really quite as if she were curious to know."
"玛丽犹豫了片刻，想了想。","Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over."
"“一点儿也不喜欢——真的。”她回答道，“但我以前从未想过这个问题。”","“Not at all—really,” she answered.“But I never thought of that before.”"
"玛莎轻轻一笑，像是回忆起了什么家中往事。","Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection."
"“我妈妈曾问过我这个问题。”她说，“她在洗衣盆旁，而我当时心情不好，正在说别人坏话。她转过身来对我说：‘内这个小泼妇，就是内。你就站在那儿，说不喜欢这个，不待见那个。你喜欢你自己吗？’妈妈的话把我逗笑了，让我立刻找回了理智。”","“Mother said that to me once,” she said.“She was at her wash-tub an’ I was in a bad temper an’ talkin’ ill of folk, an’ she turns round on me an’ says: ‘Tha’ young vixen, tha’!There tha’ stands sayin’ tha’ doesn’t like this one an’ tha’ doesn’t like that one.How does tha’ like thysel’?’It made me laugh an’ it brought me to my senses in a minute.”"
"照料玛丽吃过早饭，玛莎就情绪高涨地走了。她要走五英里的路，穿过旷野，回到自家小屋。她计划着帮妈妈做些清洗，把下一周的食物烤出来，好好放松一下。","She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her breakfast.She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week’s baking and enjoy herself thoroughly."
"房子里没有了玛莎，玛丽觉得更加孤单了。她用最快的速度来到花园，第一件事就是绕着带喷泉的花园跑了十圈。她认真地数着圈，跑完后觉得精神好了些。阳光让这个地方变得不同。旷野上空深邃高远的蓝色天空也拱跨在米瑟斯韦特庄园上。玛丽一直仰头望着天空，试图想象着躺在那雪白的小云朵上飘来飘去会是什么感觉。她走进第一个菜园，看到本·韦瑟斯达夫和另外两个园丁在工作。天气的改变似乎也感染了他。他竟然主动跟玛丽讲话。“春天来了啊。”他说，“你闻到了吗？”","Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house.She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times.She counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits.The sunshine made the whole place look different.The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about.She went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners.The change in the weather seemed to have done him good.He spoke to her of his own accord.“Springtime’s comin,’” he said.“Cannot tha’ smell it?”"
"玛丽嗅了嗅，觉得自己闻到了。","Mary sniffed and thought she could."
"“我闻到了好闻的、清新的、潮湿的味道。”她说。","“I smell something nice and fresh and damp,” she said."
"“那是肥沃的泥土的味道。”他一边挖地，一边回答道，“土地现在心情正好，准备好种植东西了。每当播种的时候，它心情都不错。冬天无所事事的时候，它心情就比较郁闷。那边的花园里，花草都在暗中疯长呢。太阳给它们温暖。过不了多久，你就能看到黑土下绿色的尖芽冒出来了。”","“That’s th’ good rich earth,” he answered, digging away.“It’s in a good humor makin’ ready to grow things.It’s glad when plantin’ time comes.It’s dull in th’ winter when it’s got nowt to do.In th’ flower gardens out there things will be stirrin’ down below in th’ dark.Th’ sun’s warmin’ ‘em.You’ll see bits o’ green spikes stickin’ out o’ th’ black earth after a bit.”"
"“那是些什么啊？”玛丽问道。","“What will they be?” asked Mary."
"“番红花，雪花莲，旱水仙。你见过这些东西吗？”","“Crocuses an’ snowdrops an’ daffydowndillys.Has tha’ never seen them?”"
"“没有。在印度，雨后总是又热又湿，一片绿色。”玛丽说，“我还以为东西都是一夜之间长出来的。”","“No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,” said Mary.“And I think things grow up in a night.”"
"“当然不是一夜之间长出来的。”韦瑟斯达夫说，“你得等。它们会从这里戳出来高一点儿，那里会长出来更高一点儿的小穗，时不时地长出一片片叶子。你看着吧。”","“These won’t grow up in a night,” said Weatherstaff.“Tha’ll have to wait for ‘em.They’ll poke up a bit higher here, an’ push out a spike more there, an’ uncurl a leaf this day an’ another that.You watch ‘em.”"
"“我会的。”玛丽回答道。","“I am going to,” answered Mary."
"很快她又听到了轻柔的、沙沙的振翅声，她立刻知道是知更鸟来了。它异常鲁莽活跃，紧靠着她脚边跳来跳去。它把头歪在一旁，狡猾地看着她。玛丽不禁问本·韦瑟斯达夫说：","Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again.He was very pert and lively, and hopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side and looked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question."
"“你觉得它还记得我吗？”","“Do you think he remembers me?” she said."
"“记得你！”韦瑟斯达夫愤慨地说道，“它记得园子里的每一个白菜桩子，更别说人了。它在这里还没见过什么小姑娘，所以你的一切都别想瞒过它。也没必要瞒它什么事。”","“Remembers thee!” said Weatherstaff indignantly.“He knows every cabbage stump in th’ gardens, let alone th’ people.He’s never seen a little wench here before, an’ he’s bent on findin’ out all about thee.Tha’s no need to try to hide anything from him.”"
"“在它住的花园里，地底下的东西也在暗中长着吗？”玛丽询问道。","“Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives?”Mary inquired."
"“什么花园？”韦瑟斯达夫嘟囔着，又变得乖戾起来。","“What garden?” grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again."
"“就是那个长着老玫瑰树的花园。”她实在太想知道了，就忍不住问了出来。“那里所有的花都死了吗，还是有些花夏天会重新长出来？那里还有玫瑰花吗？”","“The one where the old rose-trees are.”She could not help asking, because she wanted so much to know.“Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?Are there ever any roses?”"
"“去问它。”老本说，肩膀朝知更鸟耸了耸，“只有它知道。十年了，没人见过里面什么样子。”","“Ask him,” said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the robin.“He’s the only one as knows.No one else has seen inside it for ten year’.”"
"十年是一段不短的时间，玛丽想着。她就是十年前出生的。","Ten years was a long time, Mary thought.She had been born ten years ago."
"她走开了，慢慢地想着。她开始喜欢上这个花园，就像她开始喜欢知更鸟、喜欢迪肯、喜欢玛莎的妈妈一样。她也开始喜欢上玛莎了。看来有好多人可以去喜欢呢，虽然玛丽还没习惯去喜欢人。她觉得知更鸟也是一个人。她走到那条长长的、常春藤覆盖着的墙外散步，越过墙，她能看到树顶。当她走第二个来回的时候，一件非常有趣、让她激动的事情发生了。这全靠了本·韦瑟斯达夫的知更鸟。","She walked away, slowly thinking.She had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha’s mother.She was beginning to like Martha, too.That seemed a good many people to like—when you were not used to liking.She thought of the robin as one of the people.She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff’s robin."
"她听到一声唧唧的鸟鸣，朝左边光秃秃的花床望去，知更鸟正跳来跳去，忙着假装从土里啄食，好像自己并没有在跟着她。但玛丽知道它一直跟着自己。这个发现让她充满了意外的喜悦，差点颤抖了起来。","She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare flower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followed her.But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little."
"“你真的记得我！”她喊了出来，“你真的记得！你是全世界最漂亮的小东西！”","“You do remember me!” she cried out.“You do! You are prettier than anything else in the world!”"
"她学着鸟叫，说着话，哄着知更鸟，知更鸟也在一旁跳来跳去，卖弄着尾巴，婉转地叫着。它好像在说话。它那红色的小马甲像缎子一样。它挺起那小胸脯，那么精致、华丽、漂亮，似是在告诉玛丽，知更鸟有多么重要，有多么像人类。玛丽忘记了自己一直都是个别扭的孩子。她慢慢靠近知更鸟，一边靠近，一边弯下身来，试图发出像知更鸟的声音，跟它沟通。而知更鸟对她的靠近似乎也并不反感。","She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail and twittered.It was as if he were talking.His red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be.Mistress Mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds."
"看看，它竟然让玛丽靠得那么近。它知道玛丽绝不会伤害它，或让它有丝毫惊吓。它就是知道，因为它就是个真正的人——只会比其他任何人都更加善良。她高兴地大气都不敢出。","Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that!He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way.He knew it because he was a real person—only nicer than any other person in the world.She was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe."
"花床也不是完全光秃的。常青植物被修剪得光秃秃的准备过冬，但花床背后还有些高高矮矮的灌木丛一簇一簇生长着。玛丽看到知更鸟在灌木丛下跳来跳去，跳过一小堆新翻的泥土。它停了下来找虫子吃。这土是被一只小狗翻开的。那小狗挖了个很深的洞，想挖只鼹鼠出来。","The flower-bed was not quite bare.It was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth.He stopped on it to look for a worm.The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole."
"玛丽不知道那里为什么有个洞。她向那个洞望去，看到有个什么东西几乎埋在新翻开的泥土里。那东西好像一个生锈的铁环或者铜环。知更鸟飞上附近的一棵树，玛丽伸出手，捡起了那个圆环。这不是只普通的铁环，而是把旧钥匙，似乎埋在这里很久了。","Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil.It was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up.It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time."
"玛丽小姐站起来，近乎惊恐地看着挂在她手指上的钥匙。","Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger."
"“也许这钥匙已经埋了十年了。”她耳语道，“也许这就是那个花园的钥匙！”","“Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,” she said in a whisper.“Perhaps it is the key to the garden!”"
"第八章 引路的知更鸟","CHAPTER VIII THE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY"
"她盯着这钥匙好一会儿。把它翻来看去，思量了一阵儿。就像我说过的，没人教导玛丽做事需要获得准许或询问长辈的意见。对于这把钥匙，她想到的就只是，如果这真的是那个上锁的花园的钥匙，而自己能找到门在哪里，她也许就能打开门，看看墙里面是什么，看看那些老玫瑰树怎么样了。花园锁上太久了，她想进去看看。她觉得那里一定与其他地方不一样，这十年中一定发生过些奇怪的事情。而且，如果她自己喜欢这个花园，还可以每天进去，把门锁上，发明些自己的游戏，自己一个人玩儿。没人会知道她在哪里，人们会以为花园的门依旧锁着，钥匙依旧在土里埋着。只是这样想想就让她很开心。","She looked at the key quite a long time.She turned it over and over, and thought about it.As I have said before, she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things.All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees.It was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it.It seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years.Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth.The thought of that pleased her very much."
"独自在一个有着上百间上锁的神秘屋子的大宅里生活，没有什么能够自娱自乐。这样的生活让玛丽原本不活跃的头脑开始运转，她沉睡的想象力也被唤醒。毫无疑问，这与来自旷野的清新、有力、纯净的空气有莫大的关系。旷野的风让她变得有食欲，与风抗争让她热血沸腾，同时也活跃了她的头脑。在印度，她总是非常暴躁，身体孱弱，无暇关心任何事情。但在这里，她开始关心，愿意尝试新事物。虽然她自己也不清楚原因，但她已经感到自己没以前那么“别扭”了。","Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her imagination.There is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it.Just as it had given her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood, so the same things had stirred her mind.In India she had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things.Already she felt less “contrary,” though she did not know why."
"她把钥匙放进口袋里，继续来回踱步。这里除了她似乎没人来过，所以她可以悠闲地走，张望着墙，确切点儿，看着墙上覆盖着的常春藤。常春藤是让人难以琢磨的东西。无论她看得多么仔细，也只能看到密密麻麻的、光滑的暗绿色树叶。她失望极了。她继续踱步，越过常春藤望着墙里面的树梢，一股别扭劲儿又上来了。她心想，近在咫尺却不得门而入，真是傻透了。她把钥匙揣在兜里，回房去了。她决心以后出去时随身带着钥匙，一旦找到那个隐藏的门，就随时有准备。","She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk.No one but herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it.The ivy was the baffling thing.Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves.She was very much disappointed.Something of her contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside.It seemed so silly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.She took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready."
"梅德洛克太太准许玛莎在自家农舍过夜。第二天早晨玛莎回来工作，脸颊比以往更红润，精神好极了。","Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but she was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits."
"“我四点就起床了。”她说，“啊！旷野上美极了。清晨的太阳正在升起，小鸟起床了，兔子到处乱跳。我也不都是走路过来的。有个人用马车载了我一段，太开心了。”","“I got up at four o’clock,” she said.“Eh! it was pretty on th’ moor with th’ birds gettin’ up an’ th’ rabbits scamperin’ about an’ th’ sun risin’.I didn’t walk all th’ way.A man gave me a ride in his cart an’ I did enjoy myself.”"
"她出去了一天，满肚子开心的故事要分享。她妈妈见到她很开心，她们俩把所有的烘烤和洗涮的活儿都干完了。她甚至还给每个孩子做了夹少许红糖的麻团。","She was full of stories of the delights of her day out.Her mother had been glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way.She had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it."
"“他们从旷野上玩回来，我就把热腾腾镶着花饰的蛋糕准备好了。整个农舍都能闻到香喷喷的、干净的、热腾腾的烘烤的味道，炉火也烧得旺旺的，他们都高兴得欢呼起来。我们家迪肯说我们的农舍好得够给国王住。”","“I had ‘em all pipin’ hot when they came in from playin’ on th’ moor.An’ th’ cottage all smelt o’ nice, clean hot bakin’ an’ there was a good fire, an’ they just shouted for joy.Our Dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king.”"
"到了晚上，大家围坐在炉火旁，玛莎和妈妈给破衣服上打补丁，补袜子，玛莎给他们讲那个从印度来的小女孩儿。那个小女孩儿以前都是由玛莎口中的“黑人”服侍的，玛莎一直讲到她不会自己穿袜子。","In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them about the little girl who had come from India and who had been waited on all her life by what Martha called “blacks” until she didn’t know how to put on her own stockings."
"“嘿！他们顶喜欢听你的事儿呢。”玛莎说，“他们想知道关于黑人的一切，还想知道你来时坐的轮船。我怎么讲他们都听不够。”","“Eh! they did like to hear about you,” said Martha.“They wanted to know all about th’ blacks an’ about th’ ship you came in.I couldn’t tell ‘em enough.”"
"玛丽稍微想了想。","Mary reflected a little."
"“你下次出去前我多给你讲些。”她说，“这样你就有更多可讲的了。我保证他们肯定会喜欢听骑大象、骑骆驼，还有军官捕老虎的故事。”","“I’ll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,” she said, “so that you will have more to talk about.I dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers.”"
"“天啊！”玛莎高兴地喊了出来，“这要让他们脑子爆炸了。你真会这么做吗，小姐？这不跟我们听说的有一次在约克郡举办的那个野生动物展览一样吗？”","“My word!” cried delighted Martha.“It would set ‘em clean off their heads.Would tha’ really do that, Miss?It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in York once.”"
"“印度和约克郡还是差很多的。”玛丽边想事情，边慢慢地说，“我从来没想过这个问题。迪肯和你妈妈喜欢听你说起我的事情吗？”","“India is quite different from Yorkshire,” Mary said slowly, as she thought the matter over.“I never thought of that.Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?”"
"“当然了，我们家迪肯眼珠瞪得滚圆，都快掉出来了。”玛莎回答道，“但是我妈妈不喜欢你好像总是自己一个人。她说:‘克雷文先生没给她找个家教或保姆吗？’我说:‘没有，不过梅德洛克太太说他要是想起来会的。不过她也说了，先生有可能两三年也想不起来。’”","“Why, our Dickon’s eyes nearly started out o’ his head, they got that round,” answered Martha.“But mother, she was put out about your seemin’ to be all by yourself like.She said, ‘Hasn’t Mr. Craven got no governess for her, nor no nurse?’ and I said, ‘No, he hasn’t, though Mrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn’t think of it for two or three years.’”"
"“我不想要家庭教师。”玛丽生硬地说。","“I don’t want a governess,” said Mary sharply."
"“但是我妈妈说你这个年龄应该学习书本知识了，而且应该有个女人照顾你。她说:‘那么玛莎你想想看，要是你自己一个人在那么大的地方，独自一人到处游荡，也没有妈妈，会是什么感觉。你要尽力让她高兴些。’我说我会的。”","“But mother says you ought to be learnin’ your book by this time an’ you ought to have a woman to look after you, an’ she says: ‘Now, Martha, you just think how you’d feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin’ about all alone, an’ no mother.You do your best to cheer her up,’ she says, an’ I said I would.”"
"玛丽久久地、坚定地看了玛莎一阵。","Mary gave her a long, steady look."
"“你确实让我高兴起来了。”她说道，“我喜欢听你说话。”","“You do cheer me up,” she said.“I like to hear you talk.”"
"这时玛莎走出房间，回来时手中拿了什么东西，放在围裙下。","Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held in her hands under her apron."
"“你猜猜这是什么。”她开心地咧嘴笑着，“我给你买了份礼物。”","“What does tha’ think,” she said, with a cheerful grin.“I’ve brought thee a present.”"
"“礼物！”玛丽小姐惊呼道。玛莎家的小农舍里有十四个饿着肚子的人，却给她买了礼物！","“A present!” exclaimed Mistress Mary.How could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give any one a present!"
"“有个男人驾着车穿过旷野走家串户叫卖。”玛莎解释道，“他的马车在我们家门口停下来了。他那里锅碗瓢盆杂七杂八什么都有，但妈妈都没钱买。就在他准备离开时，我们家伊丽莎白·埃伦喊道:‘妈妈，他有跳绳，把手是红蓝相间的。’妈妈突然出声喊道：‘哎，先生请停一停！跳绳多少钱？’他回答说‘两便士’。妈妈开始在自己口袋里摸索，边对我说：‘玛莎，你这个好姑娘，把自己的薪水拿回来给妈妈，我恨不得把一分钱掰成四瓣花。但我准备拿出两便士，给那孩子买根跳绳。’她买了一根，就是这个。”","“A man was drivin’ across the moor peddlin’,” Martha explained.“An’ he stopped his cart at our door.He had pots an’ pans an’ odds an’ ends, but mother had no money to buy anythin’.Just as he was goin’ away our ‘Lizabeth Ellen called out, ‘Mother, he’s got skippin’-ropes with red an’ blue handles.’An’ mother she calls out quite sudden, ‘Here, stop, mister!How much are they?’An’ he says ‘Tuppence’, an’ mother she began fumblin’ in her pocket an’ she says to me, ‘Martha, tha’s brought me thy wages like a good lass, an’ I’ve got four places to put every penny, but I’m just goin’ to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippin’-rope,’ an’ she bought one an’ here it is.”"
"玛莎把跳绳从围裙下拿出来，很是骄傲地展示给玛丽看。这是条结实细长的跳绳，两头的把手是红蓝色的条纹。但是玛丽·伦诺克斯从没见过跳绳。她盯着跳绳，表情困惑。","She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly.It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before.She gazed at it with a mystified expression."
"“这是干什么用的？”她好奇地问道。","“What is it for?” she asked curiously."
"“做什么的！”玛莎喊道，“你的意思是印度没有跳绳，他们只有大象、狮子、骆驼！难怪他们大多都是黑人。跳绳是用来做这个的，看着点我。”","“For!” cried out Martha.“Does tha’ mean that they’ve not got skippin’-ropes in India, for all they’ve got elephants and tigers and camels!No wonder most of ‘em’s black.This is what it’s for; just watch me.”"
"说着玛莎就跑到屋子中间，一手拿了一头的把手开始跳了起来。她跳啊跳，玛丽从椅子中扭过来盯着她看，老画像中那些奇怪的脸好像也在盯着她看，心想这个住在农舍里的不起眼的小丫头为什么敢这么放肆，在他们眼皮底下这么做。但玛莎都浑然不觉。玛丽小姐脸上表现出的兴趣和好奇让她很开心。她继续跳，边跳边数，数到了一百。","And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair to stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to be doing under their very noses.But Martha did not even see them.The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary’s face delighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred."
"“我还可以跳更久。”玛莎停下来说，“我十二岁的时候能跳到五百呢，我那时比现在瘦，也经常练习。”","“I could skip longer than that,” she said when she stopped.“I’ve skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn’t as fat then as I am now, an’ I was in practice.”"
"玛丽从椅子上站起来，感到自己也开始兴奋了起来。","Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself."
"“这看起来不错。”她说，“你妈妈心肠真好。你觉得我也能跳你那么好吗？”","“It looks nice,” she said.“Your mother is a kind woman.Do you think I could ever skip like that?”"
"“你现在就试试。”玛莎把绳子递给她，鼓动她试一试，“最开始肯定跳不了一百个，不过练练就跳多了。这是我妈妈说的。她说：‘对她来说，没有比跳绳更好的了。跳绳是小孩儿最好的玩具。让她在新鲜的空气中跳跳，能舒展她的手脚，给她的四肢长些力气。’”","“You just try it,” urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope.“You can’t skip a hundred at first, but if you practice you’ll mount up.That’s what mother said.She says, ‘Nothin’ will do her more good than skippin’ rope.It’s th’ sensiblest toy a child can have.Let her play out in th’ fresh air skippin’ an’ it’ll stretch her legs an’ arms an’ give her some strength in ‘em.’”"
"很明显玛丽小姐刚开始跳的时候胳膊和腿都没什么力气。她不怎么擅长，却非常喜欢，不愿意停下来。","It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress Mary’s arms and legs when she first began to skip.She was not very clever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop."
"“把衣服穿上，跑出去跳去吧。”玛莎说，“我妈妈让我一定告诉你尽量多在户外，即使有点儿小雨，只要穿暖和点也可以。”","“Put on tha’ things and run an’ skip out o’ doors,” said Martha.“Mother said I must tell you to keep out o’ doors as much as you could, even when it rains a bit, so as tha’ wrap up warm.”"
"玛丽穿上外套，戴上帽子，把跳绳挽在手臂上。她刚要打开门出去，突然想起来什么事情，慢慢转过身来。","Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm.She opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly."
"“玛莎，”她说，“这是你的工资。其实是你那两便士。谢谢。”她这番话讲得很生硬，因为她不习惯感谢别人，也从没注意过别人为她做的事情。“谢谢你。”她说，一边把手伸了出来。因为她不知道除此之外还能做些什么。","“Martha,” she said, “they were your wages.It was your two-pence really. Thank you.”She said it stiffly because she was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her.“Thank you,” she said, and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do."
"玛莎轻轻地笨拙地握了握她的手，看起来她也不习惯这种事情。然后她笑了起来。","Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not accustomed to this sort of thing either.Then she laughed."
"“哎呀，内是个怪人，像个老太婆。”她说，“要是我们的伊丽莎白·埃伦的话，她会亲我一下。”","“Eh! th’ art a queer, old-womanish thing,” she said.“If tha’d been our ‘Lizabeth Ellen tha’d have given me a kiss.”"
"玛莎的表情更加僵硬了。","Mary looked stiffer than ever."
"“你想让我亲你吗？”","“Do you want me to kiss you?”"
"玛莎又笑了起来。","Martha laughed again."
"“不，不是我想要。”她回答说，“如果内要不是这种性格，可能自己就会要求亲我的。但你不会。快跑出去玩内的跳绳去吧。”","“Nay, not me,” she answered.“If tha’ was different, p’raps tha’d want to thysel’.But tha’ isn’t.Run off outside an’ play with thy rope.”"
"玛丽小姐走出房门的时候还觉得有些别扭。约克郡的人可真奇怪，玛莎对她来说永远是个谜。一开始她很不喜欢她，现在也不了。跳绳可真奇妙。她边数边跳，边数边跳，直到脸颊通红，她从出生以来都从未觉得这么有趣。阳光照耀着，还吹来一阵小风——不是凛冽的，而是一阵阵愉快的小风，带着新翻的泥土的清新。她绕着有喷泉的花园跳，从一条道上跳过去，又从另一条道跳回来。她最后跳到了菜园里，看到本·韦瑟斯达夫边锄地边跟在他身旁跳来跳去的知更鸟说话。她顺着小路跳到他身边。他抬起头，表情奇怪地看着她。她本来还担心他看不到她。她想让老本看看自己跳绳。","Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room.Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle to her.At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not.The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing.She counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was more interested than she had ever been since she was born.The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it.She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another.She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping about him.She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a curious expression.She had wondered if he would notice her.She wanted him to see her skip."
"“天啊！”他惊呼，“说实在的。你到底是个年轻人啊，血管里流的是小孩子的血液，不是发酸的剩牛奶。我以自己的名字担保，你都把脸颊跳红了。我从没想到你还可以这样。”","“Well!” he exclaimed. “Upon my word. P’raps tha’ art a young ‘un, after all, an’ p’raps tha’s got child’s blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk.Tha’s skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name’s Ben Weatherstaff.I wouldn’t have believed tha’ could do it.”"
"“我以前没跳过绳。”玛丽说，“我才刚刚开始。我只能跳到二十。”","“I never skipped before,” Mary said. “I’m just beginning. I can only go up to twenty.”"
"“那你要继续。”老本说，“你和不信上帝的人一起呆过，跳绳对锻炼你的身体有好处。你看它怎么观察你呢。”说着把头朝知更鸟一旁一偏，“它昨天就跟着你呢。今天还准备继续。它迟早要弄明白跳绳是个什么东西。它以前从没见过。哎！”他对着知更鸟摇摇头，“你要是不留意，你那好奇心总有一天会要了你的命。”","“Tha’ keep on,” said Ben.“Tha’ shapes well enough at it for a young ‘un that’s lived with heathen.Just see how he’s watchin’ thee,” jerking his head toward the robin.“He followed after thee yesterday.He’ll be at it again today.He’ll be bound to find out what th’ skippin’-rope is.He’s never seen one.Eh!” shaking his head at the bird, “tha’ curiosity will be th’ death of thee sometime if tha’ doesn’t look sharp.”"
"玛丽绕着所有的花园跳，绕着果园跳，跳几分钟休息一下。最后她来到属于自己的小道，决心试试看自己能不能跳完全程。这可有段路呢。她开始跳得慢，没跳到一半，就热得上气不接下气，不得不停下来了。不过她也不怎么在乎，因为她已经数到三十了。她停下来愉快地轻笑了笑。嘿你瞧，那知更鸟正停在一枝长长的常青藤上晃悠呢。它一直都跟着她呢，发出轻啼向她问好。玛丽朝它跳过去，每跳一下，就能感觉口袋里沉沉的什么东西正顶着她。她看到知更鸟，又笑了起来。","Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes.At length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it.It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop.She did not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty.She stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.He had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp.As Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the robin she laughed again."
"“你昨天告诉我钥匙在哪里了。”她说，“今天你应该告诉我门在哪里。不过我可不相信你知道！”","“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said.“You ought to show me the door today; but I don’t believe you know!”"
"知更鸟从它栖身的摇曳的常春藤枝头飞上墙头，张开喙，发出了一声响亮的、可爱的颤音，完全是为了炫耀。世上没有什么事情比知更鸟炫耀的时候来的更加可爱了——而它们几乎随时都在炫耀。","The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off.Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off—and they are nearly always doing it."
"玛丽·伦诺克斯从她奶妈那里听到过不少关于魔法的故事。她后来总说当时那一刻发生的是魔法。","Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah’s stories, and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic."
"一缕舒适的小风顺着走道扫过来，比其他的风都更强。风强得足以摇晃树枝，更足以摇摆墙上拖下来的未修剪过的常青藤树枝。玛丽已经走近知更鸟，突然那阵风把一些松散的常春藤树枝拂至一旁，玛丽更加突然地向它一跳，把它抓在了手中。她这么做，是因为她在它身下看到了什么东西——一个圆形的手柄，原来一直被覆盖在上面的树叶盖住了。那是个门把手。","One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest.It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.Mary had stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand.This she did because she had seen something under it—a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it.It was the knob of a door."
"她把手伸向叶子下面，开始把叶子朝两边扒拉。常春藤非常浓密，几乎成了一道松散的垂帘，虽然有些蔓生在木头和铁上。玛丽的心脏开始怦怦直跳，开心和兴奋让她的手有些微微发抖。知更鸟一直唱着歌，喳喳地叫，头歪向一侧，好像它也和玛丽一样兴奋。她手下这个方形的、铁做的、手指可以摸到上面有个洞的东西，究竟是什么呢？","She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside.Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood and iron.Mary’s heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement.The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side, as if he were as excited as she was.What was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?"
"那是那个已经紧闭十年的门上的锁。她把手放进口袋里，抽出钥匙，发现钥匙和锁孔正好契合。她把钥匙插进去扭动。要两只手才能扭动，但锁孔确实转动了。","It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole.She put the key in and turned it.It took two hands to do it, but it did turn."
"接下来她深吸了一口气，朝身后长长的走廊看了一眼有没有人来。没有人来。看起来从没人来过。她又深吸了口气，因为她实在忍不住。她把摇曳的常青藤垂帘往后拽着，把门朝后一推——门缓慢地打开了。","And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if any one was coming.No one was coming.No one ever did come, it seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not help it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly."
"然后她悄悄溜进门，把门从身后关上，背靠着门环顾四周。兴奋、好奇、开心的情绪让她呼吸急速。","Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight."
"她终于站在秘密花园里了。","She was standing inside the secret garden."
"第九章 最神秘的房子","CHAPTER IX THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANY ONE EVER LIVED IN"
"这是人们所能想象到的最甜美、最神秘的地方。使之与世隔绝的高墙上覆满了攀爬的玫瑰那光秃秃没叶子的树枝，树枝非常浓密，都缠在了一起。玛丽·伦诺克斯知道那是玫瑰，因为她在印度见过很多玫瑰。满地都被冬气肃杀的褐色枯草覆盖着，枯草中长出一丛丛灌木。它们要是还活着，一定是玫瑰树丛。这些笔直的玫瑰枝蔓延得很开，像是些小树。园子里还有些别的树。攀爬的玫瑰爬满这些树木，垂下的长蔓成了轻轻摇摆的帘幕。这是使这个地方看起来无比神秘、无比可爱的原因之一。这些枝蔓这里那里互相扭在一起，或者扭到其他一枝伸得远远的枝条。玫瑰枝条从一棵树攀爬到另一棵树，自身组成了一座座可爱的小桥。枝条上没有树叶，也没有玫瑰花，玛丽也不知道这些树枝是不是还活着。但它们纤细的灰褐色树枝和小枝杈看起来像烟霭般的罩子覆盖着一切，墙上、树上、甚至是褐色的草上。树枝从打结的地方落下，一路蔓延到地上。正是这树木间烟霭般的纠缠让一切看来如此神秘。玛丽早就知道，这个花园一定和其他没有被长期遗弃的花园不一样。果然，这花园同她所见过的任何地方都不同。","It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine.The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together.Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India.All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive.There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees.There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves.There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground.It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious.Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life."
"“多么安静啊！”她耳语道，“真安静！”","“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!”"
"然后她停了一下，仔细聆听这宁静。飞上枝头的知更鸟此刻和周围一切一样安静。它甚至连翅膀都没拍打一下，一动不动地看着玛丽。","Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness.The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest.He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary."
"“难怪这里如此安静。”她又喃喃道，“我是十年来第一个在这里说话的人。”","“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again.“I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”"
"她从门边开始移动，蹑手蹑脚，好像生怕惊动了谁。好在脚下有草，脚步就不发出声音了。她从树间一个童话般的灰色拱门下走过，抬头看那搭成拱门的枝枝蔓蔓。“我想知道它们是不是都死了。”她说，“这整个是个死花园吗？我希望不是。”","She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening some one.She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds.She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.“I wonder if they are all quite dead,” she said.“Is it all a quite dead garden?I wish it wasn’t.”"
"她要是本·韦瑟斯达夫，就能通过观察分辨出树木是不是还活着。但她只能看到褐色和灰色的枝叶和树杈，连任何丁点儿大的叶芽的痕迹都没有。","If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere."
"不过她已经在这个奇妙花园里了，她可以随时穿越常春藤架子下的门来到花园里。她觉得自己仿佛发现了一个只属于自己的世界。","But she was inside the wonderful garden and she could come through the door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all her own."
"四墙之内阳光明媚，花园上空高拱的蓝色天空也仿佛比旷野上其他地方的天空都更加温柔明媚。知更鸟从树顶飞下来，跳来跳去，跟在她身后在一棵棵树间飞来飞去。它很是叽叽喳喳了一阵，好似很忙的样子，仿佛在给玛丽指路。一切都那么奇怪而又平静。玛丽仿佛离任何人都有几百英里远。但不知为何，她一点儿都不感到孤独。唯一困扰她的，就是她想知道这些玫瑰是不是死了，或者有些也许还活着，待天气转暖，就能生发出树叶和骨朵。她可不想这真的是一座死掉的花园。倘若这是一座生机勃勃的花园该有多好，四边就会长满成千上万朵玫瑰花。","The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor.The robin flew down from his tree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another.He chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing her things.Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from any one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all.All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer.She did not want it to be a quite dead garden.If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!"
"她进来时跳绳是挽在手臂上的。走了一阵，她想可以绕着花园跳跳，想要看什么的时候再停下来。似乎到处都是长满草的小径，一两处角落里还有搭满常春藤的凉亭，里面有石凳，有些有长满苔藓的高脚花瓶。","Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she wanted to look at things.There seemed to have been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them."
"她走近第二个凉亭，停下来不跳了。这里以前有一个花床，她似乎看到什么东西从黑土中冒出——一些尖尖的暗绿色小点儿。她想起老本曾经说过的，跪下来端详它们。","As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping.There had once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earth—some sharp little pale green points.She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them."
"“是的，这些细小的东西确实在长，可能是番红花，可能是雪花莲，要么就是旱水仙。”她嘀咕道。","“Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils,” she whispered."
"她弯腰靠得更近，使劲闻着潮湿的泥土的清香。她很爱这味道。","She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth.She liked it very much."
"“也许其他地方有别的东西长出来。”她说，“我要绕着花园瞧瞧。”","“Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,” she said.“I will go all over the garden and look.”"
"她不跳绳了，开始走路。她走得很慢，眼睛不离开地面。她把旧的花坛、草间都仔细检查了一遍，走完一圈，努力不留任何遗漏。她发现了更多的尖尖的、暗绿色的点儿，又兴奋了起来。","She did not skip, but walked.She went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground.She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited again."
"“这不是座完全死掉的花园。”她柔声喊了出来，“即使玫瑰都死掉了，还有其他活物。”","“It isn’t a quite dead garden,” she cried out softly to herself.“Even if the roses are dead, there are other things alive.”"
"她对园艺一窍不通，但有些地方的草长得似乎非常茂密，绿点儿使劲往外挤，她觉得好像都没有地方供它们生长了。她四处搜寻，找到了一块很尖的木头，跪下来开始挖。她把杂草都锄干净，给绿点儿周围开辟出一小片干净的空地。","She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow.She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them."
"“这样看起来它们就可以呼吸了。”她弄完第一批，说道，“我再多弄几处。看见多少就做多少。要是今天没时间，明天还能来。”","“Now they look as if they could breathe,” she said, after she had finished with the first ones.“I am going to do ever so many more. I’ll do all I can see. If I haven’t time today I can come tomorrow.”"
"她从这里走到那里，挖土锄草，完全自得其乐。她从一个花床走向另一个花床，走到树下的草地里。运动让她热了起来。她先把外套脱掉，然后又摘掉了帽子。她甚至都没感觉到自己一直对着地上的草和暗绿色的点儿微笑。","She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the trees.The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time."
"知更鸟异常忙碌。它很高兴在自己的地盘上开始了园艺。它以前就常常捉弄本·韦瑟斯达夫。园艺一开展，各种美味的食物就随着泥土翻了出来。现在这个新来的小东西个头不及老本一半，但是懂得一进到花园里就立刻开土动工。","The robin was tremendously busy.He was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his own estate.He had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff.Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil.Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben’s size and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once."
"玛丽小姐在她的花园里一直工作到吃午饭的时间。事实上，她想起来的时候已经很晚了。她穿上外套、戴上帽子、拿起跳绳，不敢相信自己已经干了两三个小时。她一直都很开心，清空的地方可以看到几十个细小的暗绿色小点儿冒了出来，看起来比杂草窒息它们的时候有两倍生气，","Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday dinner.In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put on her coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believe that she had been working two or three hours.She had been actually happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them."
"“我下午还要回来。”她四周打量了下自己的新王国，对着树木和玫瑰丛说道，仿佛它们能听到自己一样。","“I shall come back this afternoon,” she said, looking all round at her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they heard her."
"然后她轻巧地跑过草地，慢慢推开那扇老旧的门，从常春藤下溜了出去。她双颊通红、眼睛明亮、胃口也非常好，玛莎高兴极了。","Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy.She had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted."
"“两块肉，两份儿米布丁！”玛莎说，“啊！我要告诉妈妈跳绳对你的作用，她会高兴的。”","“Two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice puddin’!” she said.“Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell her what th’ skippin’-rope’s done for thee.”"
"玛丽小姐用尖木头挖地的时候，挖出了一个非常像洋葱的白色根茎。她把它放了回去，把土轻轻拍上。她现在想玛莎能不能告诉她那是什么。","In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion.She had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was."
"“玛莎，”她问，“那些像洋葱的白色根茎是什么？”","“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look like onions?”"
"“是球茎。”玛莎回答道，“很多春天的花都从那里面长出来。小的有雪花莲、番红花，大的有水仙花、长寿花、旱水仙。最大的是百合和紫鸢尾。啊！非常漂亮。迪肯在我们家的小花园里可种了不少这些花。”","“They’re bulbs,” answered Martha.“Lots o’ spring flowers grow from ‘em.Th’ very little ones are snowdrops an’ crocuses an’ th’ big ones are narcissuses an’ jonquils and daffydowndillys.Th’ biggest of all is lilies an’ purple flags.Eh! they are nice.Dickon’s got a whole lot of ‘em planted in our bit o’ garden.”"
"“迪肯每种花都认识吗？”玛丽问道，脑子里被一个新想法充斥着。","“Does Dickon know all about them?” asked Mary, a new idea taking possession of her."
"“我们家迪肯能让砖砌的走道长出花来。妈妈说他低声私语两声，地上就能长出东西来。”","“Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk.Mother says he just whispers things out o’ th’ ground.”"
"“球茎活得久吗？如果没人照料，球茎能活很多年吗？”玛丽非常急切地询问道。","“Do bulbs live a long time?Would they live years and years if no one helped them?” inquired Mary anxiously."
"“球茎能自己照料自己。”玛莎说，“所以穷人才能养得起球茎。你只要不打扰它们，大多数球茎一辈子都在地下长着，散播小苗。在公园树丛中有一个地方，那里有成千上百的雪花莲。春天的时候，那里将是约克郡最美的风景。没人知道最早是什么时候种下的。”","“They’re things as helps themselves,” said Martha.“That’s why poor folk can afford to have ‘em.If you don’t trouble ‘em, most of ‘em’ll work away underground for a lifetime an’ spread out an’ have little ‘uns.There’s a place in th’ park woods here where there’s snowdrops by thousands.They’re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th’ spring comes.No one knows when they was first planted.”"
"“我真希望现在就是春天。”玛丽说，“我想看到长在英格兰的所有的东西。”","“I wish the spring was here now,” said Mary.“I want to see all the things that grow in England.”"
"她吃完饭，到壁炉前的地毯上自己最爱的地方坐了下来。","She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the hearth-rug."
"“我希望——我希望自己有一把小铁锹。”玛丽说。“你要用铁锹挖什么呢？”玛莎笑着问她，“你准备挖地吗？我得把这个也告诉我妈妈。”","“I wish—I wish I had a little spade,” she said.“Whatever does tha’ want a spade for?” asked Martha, laughing.“Art tha’ goin’ to take to diggin’? I must tell mother that, too.”"
"玛丽看着炉火，稍微考虑了一下。要想保住自己的神秘王国，她一定要小心。虽然她没有做什么坏事，但如果克雷文先生发现门开了，可能会愤怒得吓人，换把新钥匙，把门永远锁上。这她实在受不了。","Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little.She must be careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom.She wasn’t doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore.She really could not bear that."
"“这地方又大又冷清。”她慢慢地说道，貌似她正把事情在脑子里翻来覆去地想，“这房子也冷清，公园也冷清，花园也冷清。好多地方似乎都上了锁。在印度我没做过什么事情，但看到的人比现在多——土著、行军的士兵——有时候是乐队的演奏，奶妈还给我讲故事。在这里除了你和本·韦瑟斯达夫以外，连个说话的人也没有。而你有自己的工作要做，老本也不常常和我讲话。我想要是有个小铁锹，我就能像老本一样到处挖挖，他要是给我些种籽，我还能造个小花园。”","“This is such a big lonely place,” she said slowly, as if she were turning matters over in her mind.“The house is lonely, and the park is lonely, and the gardens are lonely.So many places seem shut up.I never did many things in India, but there were more people to look at—natives and soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told me stories.There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff.And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won’t speak to me often.I thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would give me some seeds.”"
"玛莎的脸色亮了起来。","Martha’s face quite lighted up."
"“对了！”玛莎大喊起来，“妈妈就是这么说的。她说：‘那地方那么大，空地那么多，怎么不给她一小块自己的地？即使什么都不种，种点西芹和小红萝卜也好啊！她挖一挖，耙一耙，一定乐此不疲。’这就是她的原话。”","“There now!” she exclaimed, “if that wasn’t one of th’ things mother said.She says, ‘There’s such a lot o’ room in that big place, why don’t they give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn’t plant nothin’ but parsley an’ radishes?She’d dig an’ rake away an’ be right down happy over it.’Them was the very words she said.”"
"“她真这么说的？”玛丽说，“她知道不少事情呢，不是吗？”","“Were they?” said Mary. “How many things she knows, doesn’t she?”"
"“哎呀！”玛莎说，“就像她说的‘一个带大十二个孩子的女人，总是知道点什么的’。孩子能让你明白道理，就像算术一样有效。’”","“Eh!” said Martha. “It’s like she says: ‘A woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her A B C.Children’s as good as ‘rithmetic to set you findin’ out things.’”"
"“一个铁锹多少钱——一个小的？”玛丽问道。","“How much would a spade cost—a little one?” Mary asked."
"“嗯，”玛莎想想说，“斯威特村有个类似商店的地方，我在那儿看到过园艺用具，有小铁锹、耙子、叉子，绑在一起，卖两先令。也都挺结实耐用。”","“Well,” was Martha’s reflective answer, “at Thwaite village there’s a shop or so an’ I saw little garden sets with a spade an’ a rake an’ a fork all tied together for two shillings.An’ they was stout enough to work with, too.”"
"“我钱包里的钱绰绰有余了。”玛丽说，“莫里森太太给了我五先令，克雷文先生也让梅德洛克太太给了我一些钱。”","“I’ve got more than that in my purse,” said Mary.“Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.”"
"“他还记得你啊！”玛莎惊呼。","“Did he remember thee that much?” exclaimed Martha."
"“梅德洛克太太说每周给我一先令零花。她每周六给我。我都不知道怎么花呢。”","“Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend.She gives me one every Saturday.I didn’t know what to spend it on.”"
"“我的天啊，这可是一笔不小的数目呢。”玛莎说，“用这钱你可以买世上你想要的任何东西。我家农舍的租金只有一又三分之一便士，还要从牙缝里抠才能攒够。哦，我想起件事。”她把手放在胯上。","“My word! that’s riches,” said Martha.“Tha’ can buy anything in th’ world tha’ wants.Th’ rent of our cottage is only one an’ threepence an’ it’s like pullin’ eye-teeth to get it.Now I’ve just thought of somethin’,” putting her hands on her hips."
"“什么事？”玛丽急切地问道。","“What?” said Mary eagerly."
"“斯威特村的那家商店里还有包好的花籽卖，一便士一包。我家迪肯知道哪种最漂亮，怎么种。他走着去过斯威特村好多次，就只为了好玩儿。你会写印刷体吗？”玛莎突然话锋一转。","“In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o’ flower-seeds for a penny each, and our Dickon he knows which is th’ prettiest ones an’ how to make ‘em grow.He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th’ fun of it.Does tha’ know how to print letters?” suddenly."
"“我会手写体。”玛丽回答说。","“I know how to write,” Mary answered."
"玛莎摇摇头。","Martha shook her head."
"“我家迪肯只认识印刷体。你要是会写印刷体，我们就可以给他写封信，让他帮我们去把园艺工具和花籽都买来。”","“Our Dickon can only read printin’.If tha’ could print we could write a letter to him an’ ask him to go an’ buy th’ garden tools an’ th’ seeds at th’ same time.”"
"“噢！你真是个好女孩儿！” 玛丽喊道，“你真的很好！我以前都不知道你这么善良。我知道我可以试着学写印刷体。我们向梅德洛克太太要些纸笔和墨水来吧。”","“Oh! you’re a good girl!” Mary cried.“You are, really!I didn’t know you were so nice.I know I can print letters if I try.Let’s ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.”"
"“我自己就有一些呢。”玛莎说，“我买过一些，周日的时候就试着用印刷体给妈妈写。我去拿。”玛莎说着跑出房间。玛丽站在炉火旁，全然的喜悦让她两只瘦瘦的小手扭在了一起。","“I’ve got some of my own,” said Martha.“I bought ‘em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday.I’ll go and get it.”She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thin little hands together with sheer pleasure."
"“我要是有个铁锹，”她小声嘀咕，“就能把土耙好弄松软，把杂草锄干净。我要是有花籽，就能让花长出来，不会让花园成为一座死园——花园会复活的。”","“If I have a spade,” she whispered, “I can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds.If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden won’t be dead at all—it will come alive.”"
"那天下午玛丽再没出门。因为玛莎拿了墨水、纸笔回来后，又要清理饭桌，把碗碟拿下楼去。她进了厨房，梅德洛克太太就在那里，吩咐她做了些事儿。所以玛丽感觉自己等了好久玛莎才回来。接下来给迪肯写信就是正事儿了。玛丽以前的家庭教师很不喜欢她，不愿意跟她相处。所以玛丽学到的很少。她拼写不怎么好，但她发现自己竟然可以试着写印刷体。以下是玛莎口述给她的信：“亲爱的迪肯：","She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned with her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Mary waited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back.Then it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon.Mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay with her.She could not spell particularly well but she found that she could print letters when she tried.This was the letter Martha dictated to her: “My Dear Dickon:"
"希望你见信时一切都好。玛丽小姐有很多钱，你是否可以去斯威特村帮她买些花籽和一套造花床的园艺用具。帮她选些最漂亮、最好种的。她从来没做过这些。她以前住在印度，那里跟我们这里完全不同。爱妈妈和你们每一个人。玛丽小姐准备多给我讲些故事。这样一来，下次我放假回家的时候，就能给你们多讲些大象、骆驼，还有先生们出去捕猎狮子和老虎的故事了。","This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present.Miss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed.Pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before and lived in India which is different.Give my love to mother and every one of you.Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers."
"爱你的姐姐，玛莎·菲比·索尔比。”","“Your loving sister,Martha Phoebe Sowerby.”"
"“我们把钱放进信封，我让肉店的伙计用马车带出去。他是迪肯的好朋友。”玛莎说。","“We’ll put the money in th’ envelope an’ I’ll get th’ butcher boy to take it in his cart.He’s a great friend o’ Dickon’s,” said Martha."
"“迪肯买好东西，我怎么拿呢？”","“How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?”"
"“他会亲自送来的。他喜欢走路过来。”","“He’ll bring ‘em to you himself.He’ll like to walk over this way.”"
"“噢！”玛丽喊道，“这样我就能见到他了！我从没想过能见到迪肯。”","“Oh!” exclaimed Mary, “then I shall see him!I never thought I should see Dickon.”"
"“你想见他吗？”玛莎突然问道，因为玛丽看起来实在太开心了。","“Does tha’ want to see him?” asked Martha suddenly, for Mary had looked so pleased."
"“是的，我想。我从没见过狐狸和乌鸦喜欢的男生。我非常想见他。”","“Yes, I do.I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved.I want to see him very much.”"
"玛莎稍微动了一下，好像想起什么事情了。“让我想想，”她突然说道，“我差点忘了，我今天早晨本来第一件事就是要告诉你这个的。我问过妈妈——她说她自己去问梅德洛克太太。”","Martha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.“Now to think,” she broke out, “to think o’ me forgettin’ that there; an’ I thought I was goin’ to tell you first thing this mornin’.I asked mother—and she said she’d ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.”"
"“你的意思是——”玛丽开始说。","“Do you mean—” Mary began."
"“我星期二说过的。问问她能不能什么时候把你带到我们家，尝尝我妈妈做的热腾腾的燕麦蛋糕、黄油、还有牛奶。”","“What I said Tuesday.Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o’ mother’s hot oat cake, an’ butter, an’ a glass o’ milk.”"
"好像所有有趣的事情都在这一天之内发生了。想想看，在白日蓝天下穿过旷野！去一个有十二个孩子的农舍里去！","It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day.To think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue!To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!"
"“她觉得梅德洛克太太会让我去吗？”她非常急切地问道。","“Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?” she asked, quite anxiously."
"“嗯，她觉得会的。她知道我妈妈是多么整洁的一个人，知道她把我们家打理得多干净。”","“Aye, she thinks she would.She knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage.”"
"“如果我能去，我就能看到你妈妈和迪肯了。”玛丽说道，越想越喜欢这个主意，“她看起来和印度的妈妈不一样。”","“If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,” said Mary, thinking it over and liking the idea very much.“She doesn’t seem to be like the mothers in India.”"
"花园里的辛苦和下午的兴奋，终归结束于玛丽的平静和深思。玛莎一直呆到下午茶时间，但她们舒服安静地坐着，交谈不多。玛莎刚要下楼去拿茶盘，玛丽问了她一个问题。","Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful.Martha stayed with her until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little.But just before Martha went downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question."
"“玛莎，”她问道，“那个洗碗工今天又牙疼了吗？”","“Martha,” she said, “has the scullery-maid had the toothache again today?”"
"玛莎很明显地动了一下。","Martha certainly started slightly."
"“你为什么这么问？”她说。","“What makes thee ask that?” she said."
"“因为我等你等了很久你还没回来，我就打开门顺着走廊走，看你是不是回来了。我又听到了那远处的哭声，和我们那晚听到的一样。今天没刮风，所以你看，不可能是风。”","“Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming.And I heard that far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night.There isn’t a wind today, so you see it couldn’t have been the wind.”"
"“啊！”玛莎不安地说道，“你不能在走廊里到处走到处听。克雷文先生会生气的，你可不知道他会做出什么事情来。”","“Eh!” said Martha restlessly.“Tha’ mustn’t go walkin’ about in corridors an’ listenin’.Mr. Craven would be that there angry there’s no knowin’ what he’d do.”"
"“我没有故意听。”玛丽说，“我在等你——就听到了。有三次了。”","“I wasn’t listening,” said Mary. “I was just waiting for you—and I heard it. That’s three times.”"
"“我的天啊！是梅德洛克太太在摇铃。”玛莎说着，她几乎是跑着出了房间。","“My word!There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell,” said Martha, and she almost ran out of the room."
"“这可是世上最古怪的房子了。”玛丽昏昏欲睡地说道，边把头垂到身旁扶手椅上有靠垫的座位上。新鲜空气、挖土、和跳绳都让她又累又舒服，她睡着了。","“It’s the strangest house any one ever lived in,” said Mary drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably tired that she fell asleep."
"第十章 迪肯","CHAPTER X DICKON"
"秘密花园阳光普照了将近一周。玛丽想起来的时候，就这么称呼这个花园。她喜欢这个名字，她更喜欢被美丽的老墙关在里面，没人知道她在哪里的那种感觉。就好像被关在一个与世隔绝的童话世界里。她读过的也喜欢的为数不多的几本书也都是童话故事书，有些故事里就讲到过神秘花园。有时候故事里的人们到秘密花园里睡上一百年，她觉得很傻。她可不想去睡觉。事实上，她在米瑟斯韦特庄园度过的每一天都更加清醒。她开始喜欢呆在户外，对风也不再讨厌，反而喜欢上了。她跑得更快、更远，跳绳能跳到一百下了。秘密花园里的球茎一定都感到非常惊讶。在它们周围开辟出这么好、这么干净的空地，它们有了一直以来梦寐以求的呼吸空间。真的，玛丽是不知道，它们已经开始在黑暗的土里欢欣鼓舞、起劲地长了起来。太阳可以照耀它们、温暖它们，下雨的雨水也能立刻落在它们身上。它们开始觉得异常有活力。","The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden.The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it.She liked the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was.It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place.The few books she had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories.Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid.She had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite.She was beginning to like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it.She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred.The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished.Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously.The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive."
"玛丽是个古怪、有主意的小孩儿。如今她有了自己感兴趣想要专注的事情，就变得非常投入。她干着、挖着、把草有力地拔出，一点儿都不觉得疲倦，反而越干越起劲儿。　对她来说这是一种令人着迷的游戏。她发现更多的暗绿色的点儿冒了出来，她从没想到过能发现。每天都有小点儿从各个角落冒出来。玛丽确定自己发现了很微小的新的嫩芽儿。有些小得刚刚勉强探出泥土窥探。那么多的小尖尖，让玛丽想起玛莎说过的“成千上万的雪花莲”，和玛莎说的蔓延播种的球茎。这些球茎自生自灭了十年，也许它们早已像雪莲花一样，繁衍了成千上万了。她琢磨着：要多久这些球茎才能变成花呢。她有时候停下来不挖了，抬起头来打量着这花园，试图想象待到成千上万的开花植物开满花园的时候，会是一副什么景象。阳光普照的这一周，玛丽和本·韦瑟斯达夫也熟稔了起来。她好几次突然从他身边冒了出来，吓了他一跳，好像是从地底下钻出来似的。事实上她很怕老本一看到她就背起工具走掉，所以她总是尽可能悄悄地走向他。但事实上，老本已经不像最开始那么排斥玛丽了。也许玛丽明显表现出的愿意和他这个老家伙做伴的愿望私底下取悦了他。况且，玛丽也比最开始有礼貌了。玛丽第一次见他的时候，用对待土著的方式跟他讲话。他不知道那是因为玛丽不明白一个别扭的、固执的约克郡人不习惯对主人行额手礼，不习惯被人命令去做事情。","Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it.It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play.She found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find.They seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth.There were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the “snowdrops by the thousands,” and about bulbs spreading and making new ones.These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands.She wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers.Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff.She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth.The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible.But, in fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first.Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company.Then, also, she was more civil than she had been.He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things."
"“你就像那个知更鸟一样。”一天早晨，他抬起头来，看到玛丽站在自己身边，“我永远也不知道什么时候能看见你，你会从哪边出现。”","“Tha’rt like th’ robin,” he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him.“I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha’ll come from.”"
"“它现在和我是朋友了。”玛丽说。","“He’s friends with me now,” said Mary."
"“它就是这样。”本·韦瑟斯达夫厉声说道，“虚荣轻浮，讨好异性。它为了显摆尾巴上的毛，没什么不肯干的。它骄傲极了，就像鸡蛋填满了肉。”","“That’s like him,” snapped Ben Weatherstaff.“Makin’ up to th’ women folk just for vanity an’ flightiness.There’s nothin’ he wouldn’t do for th’ sake o’ showin’ off an’ flirtin’ his tail-feathers.He’s as full o’ pride as an egg’s full o’ meat.”"
"他很少说这么多话，有时回答玛丽的问题也只是咕哝一声。但今天早晨他说得比往常多。他直起身子，把一只穿有镶着平头钉靴子的脚放在铁锹上，仔细打量玛丽。","He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary’s questions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual.He stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her over."
"“你来这儿多久了？”他脱口而出。","“How long has tha’ been here?” he jerked out."
"“我觉得有一个月了吧。”她回答道。","“I think it’s about a month,” she answered."
"“你开始有米瑟斯韦特的样子了。”他说，“你比来的时候胖了点，也没那么蜡黄了。你第一次进来这个花园的时候，就像个刚拔过毛的小乌鸦。我当时心想，我从没见过比这更丑、更凄惨的娃娃的脸。”","“Tha’s beginnin’ to do Misselthwaite credit,” he said.“Tha’s a bit fatter than tha’ was an’ tha’s not quite so yeller.Tha’ looked like a young plucked crow when tha’ first came into this garden.Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young ‘un.”"
"玛丽不虚荣，她以前也从不过分在意自己的样子，所以没觉得怎么被冒犯。","Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed."
"“我知道我变胖了。”她说，“我的袜子都变紧了。以前还打摺呢。知更鸟来了，本·韦瑟斯达夫。”","“I know I’m fatter,” she said.“My stockings are getting tighter.They used to make wrinkles.There’s the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.”"
"那边，确实是那只知更鸟。她觉得它比以前看起来更漂亮了。它的红马甲像缎子一样光滑，它摆弄着翅膀和尾巴，歪着脑袋，跳来跳去，极尽优雅。它像是打定主意让本·韦瑟斯达夫羡慕自己。但老本颇有讽刺意味。","There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever.His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces.He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him.But Ben was sarcastic."
"“是啊，这是你的艺术。”他说，“没有更好的人，你还能偶尔朝我卖弄卖弄。你一直摆弄红马甲，梳理羽毛，这样有两周了。我知道你要干什么。你在讨好那个鲁莽的年轻女士，骗她说自己是米瑟斯韦特旷野上头号漂亮的公知更鸟，随时可以和其他公知更鸟打架。”","“Aye, there tha’ art!” he said.“Tha’ can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha’s got no one better.Tha’s been reddenin’ up thy waistcoat an’ polishin’ thy feathers this two weeks.I know what tha’s up to.Tha’s courtin’ some bold young madam somewhere tellin’ thy lies to her about bein’ th’ finest cock robin on Missel Moor an’ ready to fight all th’ rest of ‘em.”"
"“噢！你瞧它！”玛丽惊呼。","“Oh! look at him!” exclaimed Mary."
"知更鸟显然正处于陶醉、大胆的情绪当中。它越跳越近，越来越专注地盯着本·韦瑟斯达夫。它飞上最近的茶藨子丛歪着头，正对着他唱一首小曲儿。","The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood.He hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly.He flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him."
"“你以为这样做就能让我算了吗？”老本说，皱起脸来，玛丽肯定他一定是想试图让自己看起来不开心。“你以为没人站出来反对你——你就是这么想的。”","“Tha’ thinks tha’ll get over me by doin’ that,” said Ben, wrinkling his face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to look pleased.“Tha’ thinks no one can stand out against thee—that’s what tha’ thinks.”"
"知更鸟展开翅膀——玛丽几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。它直接飞向本·韦瑟斯达夫的铁锹柄，停在了顶端。老本的脸慢慢皱了皱，换上另一幅表情。他站着不动，仿佛大气都不敢出——好像绝不能动，否则他的知更鸟就飞走了。他用耳语般的声音说道：","The robin spread his wings—Mary could scarcely believe her eyes.He flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff’s spade and alighted on the top of it.Then the old man’s face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression.He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe—as if he would not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.He spoke quite in a whisper."
"“好吧，我被诅咒了！”他说得很轻柔，好像是在说别的事情一样，“你确实会收买人——你确实会！你这漂亮得不属世间的小家伙，太通晓事理了。”","“Well, I’m danged!” he said as softly as if he were saying something quite different.“Tha’ does know how to get at a chap—tha’ does!Tha’s fair unearthly, tha’s so knowin’.”"
"他就那么站着不动——几乎也没有呼吸——直到知更鸟又拍了拍翅膀，飞走了。然后他站在那里看着铁锹柄，好像那上面有魔法一般。之后就又开始挖地，好几分钟也没说一句话。","And he stood without stirring—almost without drawing his breath—until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away.Then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes."
"但他不时地缓慢咧嘴一笑，玛丽也不怕跟他讲话。","But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not afraid to talk to him."
"“你有自己的园子吗？”她问。","“Have you a garden of your own?” she asked."
"“没有。我单身一个，和马丁住在大门口。”","“No. I’m bachelder an’ lodge with Martin at th’ gate.”"
"“你要是有自己的园子，”玛丽说，“你打算种些什么？”","“If you had one,” said Mary, “what would you plant?”"
"“卷心菜、洋芋、洋葱。”","“Cabbages an’ ‘taters an’ onions.”"
"“那如果你要搞一个花园呢，”玛丽继续问，“你会种些什么？”","“But if you wanted to make a flower garden,” persisted Mary, “what would you plant?”"
"“球茎和味道甜美的东西——不过主要是玫瑰。”","“Bulbs an’ sweet-smellin’ things—but mostly roses.”"
"玛丽的脸亮了起来。","Mary’s face lighted up."
"“你喜欢玫瑰吗？”她说。","“Do you like roses?” she said."
"本·韦瑟斯达夫连根拔起一根杂草扔在一边，才回答她的问题。","Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered."
"“嗯，是的我喜欢。是一个年轻女士教我的，我以前是她的花匠。她在自己喜欢的地方种了好多玫瑰，她像爱自己的孩子一样爱这些花——或者说像爱知更鸟一样。我曾见过她弯下腰来亲吻玫瑰花。”他又拔出一棵草，对着它皱了皱眉头。“那都是十年前的事情了。”","“Well, yes, I do.I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an’ she loved ‘em like they was children—or robins.I’ve seen her bend over an’ kiss ‘em.”He dragged out another weed and scowled at it.“That were as much as ten year’ ago.”"
"“她现在在哪儿？”玛丽很感兴趣地问。","“Where is she now?” asked Mary, much interested."
"“在天堂，”他回答说，把铁锹深深插进土壤，“人们是这么说的。”","“Heaven,” he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, “‘cording to what parson says.”"
"“那玫瑰怎么样了？”玛丽又问，更加感兴趣了。","“What happened to the roses?”Mary asked again, more interested than ever."
"“它们就那么自生自灭了。”","“They was left to themselves.”"
"玛丽变得非常激动。","Mary was becoming quite excited."
"“那它们都死了吗？让它们自己呆着会死吗？”她斗胆问道。","“Did they quite die?Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves?” she ventured."
"“嗯，我以前很喜欢它们，也喜欢她，她也很喜欢玫瑰花，”本·韦瑟斯达夫极不情愿地承认道，“一年我要打理它们一两回，修修剪剪，挖根松土。草疯长，但是土很肥沃，所以有些活下来了。”","“Well, I’d got to like ‘em—an’ I liked her—an’ she liked ‘em,” Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly.“Once or twice a year I’d go an’ work at ‘em a bit—prune ‘em an’ dig about th’ roots.They run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of ‘em lived.”"
"“它们没有叶子，看起来又灰又褐，干瘪瘪的，你怎么知道它们是活着还是死了？”玛丽询问道。","“When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?” inquired Mary."
"“等春天降临在它们身上——太阳照进雨水，雨水落到太阳上，然后你就知道了。”","“Wait till th’ spring gets at ‘em—wait till th’ sun shines on th’ rain and th’ rain falls on th’ sunshine an’ then tha’ll find out.”"
"“怎么知道——怎么知道？”玛丽喊了出来，忘记了要小心仔细。“顺着嫩枝和枝条看，要是你看到到处有小点的褐色的小包隆起，春雨之后你再看看会发生什么。”他突然停了下来，好奇地看着玛丽急切的脸。“你为什么突然间对玫瑰这些东西这么感兴趣？”他问道。","“How—how?” cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.“Look along th’ twigs an’ branches an’ if tha’ see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an’ there, watch it after th’ warm rain an’ see what happens.”He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.“Why does tha’ care so much about roses an’ such, all of a sudden?” he demanded."
"玛丽小姐觉得自己的脸变红了。她几乎不敢回答。","Mistress Mary felt her face grow red.She was almost afraid to answer."
"“我——我想玩儿——我有一个自己的花园。”她结结巴巴地说，“我——我也没什么可做的。我什么也没有——也没有人。”","“I—I want to play that—that I have a garden of my own,” she stammered.“I—there is nothing for me to do.I have nothing—and no one.”"
"“嗯，”本·韦瑟斯达夫看着她，慢慢地说，“这倒是实话。你确实没有。”","“Well,” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, “that’s true.Tha’ hasn’t.”"
"他说话的口吻很奇怪，玛丽怀疑他其实是不是有点可怜自己。她从没可怜过自己，她只感到过疲惫和气愤，因为她是如此讨厌人和事。但现在好像世界在变，变得可亲起来。要是没人发现秘密花园，她就能一直自得其乐下去。","He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her.She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much.But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer.If no one found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always."
"她又和老本呆了十到十五分钟，把所有敢问的问题都问了个遍。他奇怪地嘟囔着，有问必答。他看起来没有真生气，也没有拾起铁锹离开她。玛丽就要离开的时候，老本说了些关于玫瑰花的事情，这让玛丽想起了老本说过的自己曾经非常喜欢的玫瑰花。","She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared.He answered every one of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her.He said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of."
"“你如今还去看那些玫瑰花吗？”玛丽问道。","“Do you go and see those other roses now?” she asked."
"“今年没去过。我的风湿让我关节僵硬得厉害。”","“Not been this year.My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th’ joints.”"
"他喃喃地说着，随后很突然，他好像生玛丽的气了，虽然玛丽自己都不知道原因。","He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to get angry with her, though she did not see why he should."
"“你听着！”他突兀地说，“别问这么多问题。你是我碰到的小娃子中最爱问问题的。去玩去吧。我今天说的够多的了。”","“Now look here!” he said sharply.“Don’t tha’ ask so many questions.Tha’rt th’ worst wench for askin’ questions I’ve ever come a cross.Get thee gone an’ play thee.I’ve done talkin’ for today.”"
"老本语气很生气，玛丽知道再呆下去也没有任何必要了。她沿着外侧走道慢慢跳，反复琢磨老本的话，对自己说着话。说来也奇怪，又有一个人让玛丽喜欢了。虽然老本脾气乖戾，玛丽却喜欢他。","And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute.She went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness.She liked old Ben Weatherstaff."
"是的，她的确喜欢他。她总是试图让老本和自己讲话。她也开始相信，老本了解这世上关于花的所有的事。","Yes, she did like him.She always wanted to try to make him talk to her.Also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers."
"蜿蜒在秘密花园周围的是月桂树篱笆的走道，走道蜿蜒至一道门，门通往公园里的一个树林。她打算沿着小径跳，看看树林里是不是有兔子四处蹦。她跳得很开心。她跳到门口，打开那道小门，穿了过去。因为她听到了一声低沉、奇怪的口哨声，想知道那是什么。","There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park.She thought she would skip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about.She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was."
"那声音真的很奇怪。她屏住呼吸，停下来看。一个小男孩儿坐在树下，背靠着树，吹着一个木制的粗糙的笛子。他看起来很快乐，大约十二岁的样子。他看上去很干净，鼻子朝天翘着，脸颊像罂粟花一样红。玛丽小姐从没在男生的脸上见到过这么圆、这么蓝的眼睛。在他所倚靠的树干上，有只棕色的小松鼠攀在上面打量着他；附近的灌木丛后面，一只欢快的公鸡正优雅地伸长脖子啄着；就在他旁边，两只兔子坐直身子，鼻子一颤一颤闻着——看样子，它们竟然都被吸引到他身边，看着他，听着他的笛子发出的低沉的、奇怪的呼唤。","It was a very strange thing indeed.She quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it.A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe.He was a funny looking boy about twelve.He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy’s face.And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses—and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make."
"看到玛丽，他伸出手，用低沉的、近乎他的笛声的声音跟玛丽说话。","When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping."
"“别动。”他说，“会吓走它们的。”玛丽定住不动了。他不吹笛子了，从地上坐了起来。他动作慢得几乎看不出来。不过最后他站起身来，随后松鼠也窜上树上的枝叶里；快乐的公鸡也把头缩了回去；兔子四脚落地，跳开了。不过它们一点儿也没显得被吓到了。","“Don’t tha’ move,” he said.“It’d flight ‘em.”Mary remained motionless.He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground.He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened."
"“我叫迪肯。”男孩儿说，“我知道你是玛丽小姐。”","“I’m Dickon,” the boy said.“I know tha’rt Miss Mary.”"
"这时玛丽才意识到不知为什么，她从最开始就知道他是迪肯了。除了他之外，还有谁能像印度土著吸引蛇一样，吸引兔子和公鸡呢。他红红的嘴宽宽的、弯弯的，满脸挂着笑容。","Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was Dickon.Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India?He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face."
"“我慢慢起来，”他解释说，“因为如果动得快了，会吓坏它们的。周围有野生动物时身体移动要轻，说话声音要低。”","“I got up slow,” he explained, “because if tha’ makes a quick move it startles ‘em.A body ‘as to move gentle an’ speak low when wild things is about.”"
"他跟玛丽说话的语气不像俩人从未谋面，倒像是他已经很了解她一样。玛丽对男生一点儿都不了解。她对迪肯说话稍有生硬，因为她很害羞。","He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if he knew her quite well.Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy."
"“你收到玛莎的信了吗？”她问道。","“Did you get Martha’s letter?” she asked."
"迪肯点点头，一头铁锈红色的卷发。“所以我就来了。”","He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.“That’s why I come.”"
"他弯下腰来捡起了地上的什么东西，他吹笛子时那东西放在身边的地上。","He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him when he piped."
"“我把园艺用具拿来了。有一个小铁锹、一个耙子、一个叉子和一把锄头。啊！都是些好的。还有一个泥铲子。我买别的花籽的时候，店里卖东西的女人还送了一包白罂粟和一包蓝飞燕草。”","“I’ve got th’ garden tools.There’s a little spade an’ rake an’ a fork an’ hoe.Eh! they are good ‘uns.There’s a trowel, too.An’ th’ woman in th’ shop threw in a packet o’ white poppy an’ one o’ blue larkspur when I bought th’ other seeds.”"
"“能让我看看花籽吗？”玛丽说。","“Will you show the seeds to me?” Mary said."
"她希望自己能像他讲话一样。他说话快且不费力。听起来他喜欢她，而且一点儿也不担心她会不喜欢他，尽管他只是个普通的旷野上的男孩儿，穿着补丁衣服，脸上挂着滑稽的表情，头发粗糙，颜色锈红。走近他，玛丽发觉迪肯周身有种石南、青草、树叶的干净清新的味道，就好像他就是由那些做成的一样。玛丽很喜欢这种味道。她看着迪肯滑稽的脸、红红的脸颊、圆圆的蓝色眼睛，她都忘记了自己刚刚还害羞呢。","She wished she could talk as he did.His speech was so quick and easy.It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head.As she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them.She liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy."
"“我们坐在这跟圆木上看看。”她说。","“Let us sit down on this log and look at them,” she said."
"他们坐下，迪肯从外衣口袋拿出一个粗粗笨笨的牛皮纸小棕口袋。他解开绳子，袋子里面还有好多个整齐的更小的袋子，每个上面都有一种花的图案。","They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket.He untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one."
"“有很多木樨花和罂粟花。”他说，“木樨花味道最甜美，你随便播种在哪里都能长，罂粟也是这样。你只要对着它们吹口哨它们就会开花，它们的花是最美的。”他停下来很快地转头。他罂粟花一样红的脸颊亮了起来。","“There’s a lot o’ mignonette an’ poppies,” he said.“Mignonette’s th’ sweetest smellin’ thing as grows, an’ it’ll grow wherever you cast it, same as poppies will.Them as’ll come up an’ bloom if you just whistle to ‘em, them’s th’ nicest of all.”He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting up."
"“叫我们的知更鸟在哪里？”他问。","“Where’s that robin as is callin’ us?” he said."
"啾啾声来自浓密的冬青丛，猩红的腹部颜色鲜亮。玛丽想自己知道那是谁了。","The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet bellies, and Mary thought she knew whose it was."
"“它真的是在叫我们吗？”她问。","“Is it really calling us?” she asked."
"“当然！”迪肯说，仿佛这是世上最自然不过的事情，“它在叫它的某个朋友。它在叫着：‘我在这里。看着我。跟我聊聊。’它在丛林里。它是谁的？”","“Aye,” said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, “he’s callin’ some one he’s friends with.That’s same as sayin’ ‘Here I am. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.’ There he is in the bush. Whose is he?”"
"“它是本·韦瑟斯达夫的，不过我觉得它也有点儿认识我。”玛丽回答说。","“He’s Ben Weatherstaff’s, but I think he knows me a little,” answered Mary."
"“是，它认识你。”迪肯又用自己低沉的嗓音说道，“并且它喜欢你。它把你当自己人了。它马上就会告诉我关于你的一切。”","“Aye, he knows thee,” said Dickon in his low voice again.“An’ he likes thee.He’s took thee on.He’ll tell me all about thee in a minute.”"
"就如玛丽早前见过的那样，迪肯慢慢移动着，移到离灌木丛很近的地方，然后发出了一声几乎和知更鸟自己的啁啾一样的声音。知更鸟专注地听了几秒钟，然后像是回答问题一样，给予了回应。","He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin’s own twitter.The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if he were replying to a question."
"“哎呀，它是你的朋友。”迪肯轻笑道。","“Aye, he’s a friend o’ yours,” chuckled Dickon."
"“你觉得它是吗？”玛丽急切地问道。她真的很想知道。“你觉得它真的喜欢我吗？”","“Do you think he is?” cried Mary eagerly.She did so want to know.“Do you think he really likes me?”"
"“它要是不喜欢你，不会靠近你的。”迪肯回答道，“鸟儿很挑人，知更鸟比人类还会鄙视人呢。你看，它在讨好你呢。他在说：‘你没看见一个家伙吗？’”","“He wouldn’t come near thee if he didn’t,” answered Dickon.“Birds is rare choosers an’ a robin can flout a body worse than a man.See, he’s making up to thee now.‘Cannot tha’ see a chap?’ he’s sayin’.”"
"看起来这还真是事实。它在灌木上跳来跳去，一边侧身走着、鸣叫着、倾斜着。","And it really seemed as if it must be true.He so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush."
"“鸟说的你都能听懂吗？”玛丽问。","“Do you understand everything birds say?” said Mary."
"迪肯笑了，直到脸上只剩下他那宽大的、红红的、弯弯的嘴巴。他揉了揉自己粗糙的脑袋。","Dickon’s grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he rubbed his rough head."
"“我觉得可以，它们也觉得我能。”他说，“我在旷野上和它们呆了这么久了。我看到它们破壳而出、长羽毛、学会飞、开始唱歌，直到我觉得自己已经成了它们中的一个。有时候我都觉得自己也许就是只鸟、或者狐狸、兔子、松鼠，要不就是一只甲壳虫，只是我自己不知道而已。”","“I think I do, and they think I do,” he said.“I’ve lived on th’ moor with ‘em so long.I’ve watched ‘em break shell an’ come out an’ fledge an’ learn to fly an’ begin to sing, till I think I’m one of ‘em.Sometimes I think p’raps I’m a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel, or even a beetle, an’ I don’t know it.”"
"他笑了起来，又回到圆木上，开始说花籽。他告诉玛丽它们开花时都是什么样子的，告诉她怎么栽种、照料花，给它们浇水、施肥。","He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again.He told her what they looked like when they were flowers; he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them."
"“你看这儿。”他突然转身看着她，说道，”我亲自给你种。你的花园在哪里？”","“See here,” he said suddenly, turning round to look at her.“I’ll plant them for thee myself.Where is tha’ garden?”"
"玛丽干瘦的两只小手紧紧地攥着，手放在大腿上。她不知道该说些什么，整整一分钟都一言不发。她从未想过这个问题。她觉得有点凄惨。她觉得自己的脸好像一阵红一阵白。","Mary’s thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap.She did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing.She had never thought of this.She felt miserable.And she felt as if she went red and then pale."
"“你有片儿小花园的吧，不是吗？”迪肯问。","“Tha’s got a bit o’ garden, hasn’t tha’?” Dickon said."
"她的脸确实是一阵红一阵白。迪肯都注意到了。玛丽还是一言不发，迪肯开始觉得困惑了。","It was true that she had turned red and then pale.Dickon saw her do it, and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled."
"“他们不愿意给你吗？”迪肯问，“你还没得到吗？”","“Wouldn’t they give thee a bit?” he asked.“Hasn’t tha’ got any yet?”"
"玛丽把手攥得更紧了，眼睛看向迪肯。","She held her hands tighter and turned her eyes toward him."
"“我一点儿都不了解男生。”她慢慢地说，“如果我告诉你一个秘密，你可以保守秘密吗？这是个大秘密。我不知道要是有人发现了我该怎么办。我觉得我会死的！”她最后一句话说得十分用力。","“I don’t know anything about boys,” she said slowly.“Could you keep a secret, if I told you one?It’s a great secret.I don’t know what I should do if any one found it out.I believe I should die!”She said the last sentence quite fiercely."
"迪肯看起来更加困惑了，他又用手搓了搓粗糙的脑袋，不过仍然好脾气地回答道：“我是个能保守秘密的人。”他说，“要是我不能对其他兄弟保守秘密，不能保守狐狸幼仔的秘密、鸟巢的秘密、野生动物的洞的秘密，旷野上就没有安全可言了。没问题，我能保守秘密。”","Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.“I’m keepin’ secrets all th’ time,” he said.“If I couldn’t keep secrets from th’ other lads, secrets about foxes’ cubs, an’ birds’ nests, an’ wild things’ holes, there’d be naught safe on th’ moor.Aye, I can keep secrets.”"
"玛丽小姐本没想这么做，可她却伸出手来，抓紧了迪肯的袖子。","Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she did it."
"“我偷了一个花园。”她非常快速地说道，“那不是我的。也不是任何人的。没人要它，没人关心它，甚至没人进去。也许里面的一切都已经死掉了。我也不知道。”","“I’ve stolen a garden,” she said very fast.“It isn’t mine.It isn’t anybody’s.Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into it.Perhaps everything is dead in it already.I don’t know.”"
"她开始觉得热，感到像从前一样乖戾。","She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life."
"“我不管，我不管！我在乎它，别人不在乎。没人有权利从我手中夺走它。他们就任它自生自灭，把它关起来。”她激烈地说完，把胳膊盖在脸上，放声哭了起来——可怜的小玛丽小姐。","“I don’t care, I don’t care!Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they don’t.They’re letting it die, all shut in by itself,” she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her face and burst out crying-poor little Mistress Mary."
"迪肯好奇的蓝色眼睛变得更圆了。“啊——啊——啊！”他慢慢发出一声惊叹，既因为惊奇，也因为同情。","Dickon’s curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.“Eh-h-h!” he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy."
"“我没什么事儿可做。”玛丽说，“我一无所有。那是我自己找到，自己进去的。我只不过就像那只知更鸟一样，他们不会把花园从知更鸟那里夺走。”“花园在哪里？”迪肯放低声音问道。","“I’ve nothing to do,” said Mary.“Nothing belongs to me.I found it myself and I got into it myself.I was only just like the robin, and they wouldn’t take it from the robin.”“Where is it?” asked Dickon in a dropped voice."
"玛丽小姐立刻从圆木上站了起来。她觉得自己叛逆、烦躁的心情又来了，不过她一点儿也不在意。她专横、有印度做派，且暴躁而又悲伤。","Mistress Mary got up from the log at once.She knew she felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she did not care at all.She was imperious and Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful."
"“跟我来，我带你看。”她说。","“Come with me and I’ll show you,” she said."
"她带着迪肯绕过月桂小径，向长着浓密的常春藤的走道走去。迪肯跟在后面，脸上一副奇怪、近乎怜悯的表情。他觉得自己好像被带着去看一个陌生的鸟儿的巢，必须行动轻柔。当玛丽迈向墙，抬起垂挂的常春藤枝的时候，他惊呆了。那儿有一道门。玛丽把门慢慢推开，俩人一同进去。然后玛丽站定，挑衅地大肆挥舞着手。","She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly.Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his face.He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird’s nest and must move softly.When she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started.There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly."
"“就是这儿。”她说，“这是个秘密花园，我是这世上唯一希望它活着的人。”","“It’s this,” she said.“It’s a secret garden, and I’m the only one in the world who wants it to be alive.”"
"迪肯一遍遍地环顾着这个花园。","Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again."
"“啊！”他用近乎耳语的声音说，“这是个奇怪而又漂亮的地方！就好像人在梦中一样。”","“Eh!” he almost whispered, “it is a queer, pretty place!It’s like as if a body was in a dream.”"
"第十一章 米瑟斯韦特旷野画眉鸟的窝","CHAPTER XI THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH"
"有那么两三分钟，迪肯站在那里环顾四周，玛丽看着他。然后迪肯开始轻轻地走来走去，比玛丽第一次发现自己置身这四面墙中的时候还要轻柔。他的眼睛似乎了然一切——灰色的树上爬着灰色的匍匐植物，从树枝上垂吊着；墙上和草间的一团团植物；常青藤植物的凉亭，里面有石凳；高脚花瓶高高地站着。","For two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Mary watched him, and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked the first time she had found herself inside the four walls.His eyes seemed to be taking in everything—the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them."
"“我从没想过我能见到这个地方。”他终于耳语般地说。","“I never thought I’d see this place,” he said at last, in a whisper."
"“你以前知道它吗？”玛丽问。","“Did you know about it?” asked Mary."
"她说得很大声，迪肯对她做了个手势。","She had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her."
"“我们得低声说话。”他说，“否则会被人听到，怀疑这里面发生了什么。”","“We must talk low,” he said, “or some one’ll hear us an’ wonder what’s to do in here.”"
"“噢！我忘记了！”玛丽说着，惊恐得迅速用手遮住了嘴。“你以前知道这花园吗？”玛丽回过神来，又问了一遍。迪肯点点头。","“Oh! I forgot!” said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her hand quickly against her mouth.“Did you know about the garden?” she asked again when she had recovered herself.Dickon nodded."
"“玛莎告诉我有个花园，没人进去过。”他回答道，“我们以前常常好奇它是什么样子。”","“Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,” he answered.“Us used to wonder what it was like.”"
"他停下来打量四周那些可爱的灰色缠结，他那圆眼睛看起来异常快乐。","He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and his round eyes looked queerly happy."
"“啊！春天的时候这里会有好多巢。”他说，“这里该是全英格兰最安全的筑巢的地方。这附近没人来，这些树枝的缠结和玫瑰什么的都能筑巢。我奇怪全旷野上所有的鸟儿怎么没来这里筑巢。”","“Eh! the nests as’ll be here come springtime,” he said.“It’d be th’ safest nestin’ place in England.No one never comin’ near an’ tangles o’ trees an’ roses to build in.I wonder all th’ birds on th’ moor don’t build here.”"
"玛丽小姐不知不觉又把手放在了迪肯的胳膊上。","Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it."
"“这些都是玫瑰吗？”她小声问，“你能分辨出来吗？我原以为它们都死了。”","“Will there be roses?” she whispered. “Can you tell? I thought perhaps they were all dead.”"
"“啊！不！不是——不是全部！”他回答说，“看这里！”","“Eh! No! Not them—not all of ‘em!” he answered. “Look here!”"
"他迈步到最近的一棵树——一颗很老的树，树皮上长满了地衣，但撑起了一帘纠缠的花枝和枝条。他从口袋里拿出一把厚实的刀，打开其中一把刀片。","He stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches.He took a thick knife out of his Pocket and opened one of its blades."
"“这里有很多死树要割掉。”他说，“还有很多老树，不过去年长出了一些新的。这里就是个新点儿。”他摸着一个尖芽，不是干硬的灰色，而是绿中带褐。玛丽虔诚而又急切地摸了摸它。","“There’s lots o’ dead wood as ought to be cut out,” he said.“An’ there’s a lot o’ old wood, but it made some new last year.This here’s a new bit,” and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray.Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way."
"“那个吗？”她说，“那个还活得很好吗？”","“That one?” she said. “Is that one quite alive quite?”"
"迪肯弯了弯他宽宽的、微笑的嘴。","Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth."
"“它和你我一样灵。”他说道。玛丽想起玛莎说过“灵”就是有活力、活泼的意思。","“It’s as wick as you or me,” he said; and Mary remembered that Martha had told her that “wick” meant “alive” or “lively.”"
"“我希望它灵！”她低声喊道，“我希望它们都灵。我们在花园里转转，数数共有多少个灵的。”","“I’m glad it’s wick!” she cried out in her whisper.“I want them all to be wick.Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are.”"
"玛丽热切地喘着气，迪肯和她一样热切。他们走过一棵棵树，一个个灌木丛。迪肯手里拿着他的刀，向她展示她觉得奇妙的东西。","She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was.They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush.Dickon carried his knife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful."
"“它们都长疯了。”他说，“但最强壮的都长得很繁茂。最弱的都死掉了，但其他的一直长啊长，蔓延啊蔓延，直到成了个奇观。看这里！”他拉下一根灰色的、模样干枯的粗枝，“一般人会认为这是枝枯木了，但我认为不是——没有死到根里。我来割到根里看看。”","“They’ve run wild,” he said, “but th’ strongest ones has fair thrived on it.The delicatest ones has died out, but th’ others has growed an’ growed, an’ spread an’ spread, till they’s a wonder.See here!” and he pulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch.“A body might think this was dead wood, but I don’t believe it is—down to th’ root.I’ll cut it low down an’ see.”"
"他跪下来，在离地面不远的地方用刀子割穿那看起来毫无生气的树枝。","He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not far above the earth."
"“那儿！”迪肯欣喜若狂叫着，“我告诉过你的。这木头里还有绿色。你看。”","“There!” he said exultantly. “I told thee so. There’s green in that wood yet. Look at it.”"
"玛丽早在迪肯说话前就已经跪在地上，尽全力凝视着。","Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might."
"“那些看着有点绿色的、含汁的，就是灵的。”迪肯解释道，“那些里面干、容易断的，就像这根我割下来的，就没救了。这儿有个大根里面冒出活的枝丫。如果把这老的枯枝割了，把周围的土松一松，好好打理，将会——”他停下来抬起脸看着头顶攀爬垂挂的枝条——“这里今年夏天将会有一个玫瑰喷泉。”","“When it looks a bit greenish an’ juicy like that, it’s wick,” he explained.“When th’ inside is dry an’ breaks easy, like this here piece I’ve cut off, it’s done for.There’s a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of, an’ if th’ old wood’s cut off an’ it’s dug round, and took care of there’ll be—” he stopped and lifted his face to look up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—“there’ll be a fountain o’ roses here this summer.”"
"他们走过一片片灌木，一棵棵树。迪肯很有力气，用刀也灵巧，他知道怎么把枯死的植物割掉，能辨认一根不被看好的大树枝或小枝丫是否还有绿色生命。过了半小时，玛丽觉得自己也能辨认了。迪肯割断一根看起来毫无生气的枝条，玛丽看到极小一片湿绿，便屏住呼吸，欢快地喊了出来。铁锹、锄头、叉子都很有用。迪肯边用铁锹在根周围挖土，翻土好让空气进去，边教玛丽怎么用叉子。","They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree.He was very strong and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it.In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell too, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade of moist green.The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful.He showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in."
"他们在最大、最笔直的一株玫瑰周围勤奋地劳作着，突然迪肯看到了什么，不由得发出了一声惊奇的感叹。","They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses when he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise."
"“怎么回事？”他指着几英尺外的草喊了出来，“那是谁干的？”","“Why!” he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away.“Who did that there?”"
"那是玛丽自己清扫出来的、暗绿色小点儿周围的一片空地。","It was one of Mary’s own little clearings round the pale green points."
"“是我。”玛丽说。","“I did it,” said Mary."
"“天啊，我原以为你对园艺一窍不通呢。”迪肯惊呼。","“Why, I thought tha’ didn’t know nothin’ about gardenin’,” he exclaimed."
"“我确实一窍不通。”她回答道，“但它们那么小，草那么浓密有力，它们看起来好像没有呼吸的空间。所以我给它们辟出了块地方。我都不知道它们是什么。”","“I don’t,” she answered, “but they were so little, and the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe.So I made a place for them.I don’t even know what they are.”"
"迪肯走过去跪在它们旁边，咧嘴笑了起来。","Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile."
"“这样做是对的。”他说，“园丁能告诉你的也不过如此。现在它们就会像杰克的魔豆一样长了。这些是番红花和雪花莲，那边是棵水仙。”迪肯转向另一片地，“这是棵旱水仙。啊！这里将会是一景的。”","“Tha’ was right,” he said.“A gardener couldn’t have told thee better.They’ll grow now like Jack’s bean-stalk.They’re crocuses an’ snowdrops, an’ these here is narcissuses,” turning to another patch, “an here’s daffydowndillys.Eh! they will be a sight.”"
"他从一片空地跑向另一块空地。","He ran from one clearing to another."
"“对一个小女孩儿来说，你着实做了不少。”他说，边打量着她。","“Tha’ has done a lot o’ work for such a little wench,” he said, looking her over."
"“我长胖了。”玛丽说，“我也变结实了。我以前常常觉得累。我挖地的时候一点儿也不觉得累。我喜欢闻土地翻开的味道。”","“I’m growing fatter,” said Mary, “and I’m growing stronger.I used always to be tired.When I dig I’m not tired at all.I like to smell the earth when it’s turned up.”"
"“这对你非常有好处。”迪肯赞许地点点头，说道，“除了雨水打在正在生长的新鲜植物上的味道以外，没有什么比新鲜干净的好土的味道更好闻的了。下雨天我常常跑出去到旷野上去，躺在灌木丛下，听着落在石南上柔和细碎的沙沙声，闻啊闻啊。到最后，我妈妈说我的鼻子抖得跟兔子一样。”","“It’s rare good for thee,” he said, nodding his head wisely.“There’s naught as nice as th’ smell o’ good clean earth, except th’ smell o’ fresh growin’ things when th’ rain falls on ‘em.I get out on th’ moor many a day when it’s rainin’ an’ I lie under a bush an’ listen to th’ soft swish o’ drops on th’ heather an’ I just sniff an’ sniff.My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit’s, mother says.”"
"“你没感冒过吗？”玛丽惊讶地盯着他，问道。她从没见过这么有趣，或者说这么善良的男孩儿。","“Do you never catch cold?” inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly.She had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one."
"“我不会。”迪肯笑笑说，“从我生下来就没感冒过。我没被养得那么精细。像兔子一样，无论什么天气我都在旷野上追来追去。妈妈说我十二年来吸了足够的新鲜空气，不容易感冒。我结实得像个带白刺的瘤头棍棒。”","“Not me,” he said, grinning.“I never ketched cold since I was born.I wasn’t brought up nesh enough.I’ve chased about th’ moor in all weathers same as th’ rabbits does.Mother says I’ve sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year’ to ever get to sniffin’ with cold.I’m as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.”"
"他不停地干活。他说着话，玛丽跟在他身后，拿着她的叉子或泥刀帮忙。","He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following him and helping him with her fork or the trowel."
"“这儿有好多活儿可干！”他又说了一遍，狂喜地环顾四周。","“There’s a lot of work to do here!” he said once, looking about quite exultantly."
"“你还会来帮我吗？”玛丽恳求道，“我肯定也能帮上忙。我会挖土、拔草，你让我干什么我就干什么。哦，来吧，迪肯！”","“Will you come again and help me to do it?” Mary begged.“I’m sure I can help, too.I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me.Oh! do come, Dickon!”"
"“如果你让我来，我就天天来，风雨无阻。”他回答得很坚决，“这是我玩过的最有趣的——关在这里面，唤醒一个花园。”","“I’ll come every day if tha’ wants me, rain or shine,” he answered stoutly.“It’s the best fun I ever had in my life—shut in here an’ wakenin’ up a garden.”"
"“如果你能来，”玛丽说，“如果你能来帮我把它唤醒，我——我也不知道能做些什么。”玛丽无力地停了下来。这样一个男孩儿，能为他做些什么呢？","“If you will come,” said Mary, “if you will help me to make it alive I’ll—I don’t know what I’ll do,” she ended helplessly.What could you do for a boy like that?"
"“我来告诉你你能做什么。”迪肯快乐地笑着说，“你能长胖，像小狐狸一样总是觉得饿，你也能学会像我一样同知更鸟说话。啊！我们会有很多乐趣的。”","“I’ll tell thee what tha’ll do,” said Dickon, with his happy grin.“Tha’ll get fat an’ tha’ll get as hungry as a young fox an’ tha’ll learn how to talk to th’ robin same as I do.Eh! we’ll have a lot o’ fun.”"
"他开始四处走，仰头看着树、墙、和灌木丛，表情若有所思。","He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression."
"“我不会把它造成一个花匠的花园，一切都修剪过，井井有条的，你觉得呢？”他说道，“就像现在这样更好，东西疯长，摇摆着，互相缠绕着。”","“I wouldn’t want to make it look like a gardener’s garden, all clipped an’ spick an’ span, would you?” he said.“It’s nicer like this with things runnin’ wild, an’ swingin’ an’ catchin’ hold of each other.”"
"“我们不要把它弄整齐。”玛丽急切地说，“整齐了就不像秘密花园了。”","“Don’t let us make it tidy,” said Mary anxiously.“It wouldn’t seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.”"
"迪肯站在那里，揉了揉自己长着锈红色头发的头，表情很是困惑。“这一定是个秘密花园。”他说，“但是看来，自从十年前上锁后，期间除了知更鸟还有人来过。”","Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.“It’s a secret garden sure enough,” he said, “but seems like some one besides th’ robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year’ ago.”"
"“但这门是锁着的，钥匙也埋了起来。”玛丽说，“没人能进来。”","“But the door was locked and the key was buried,” said Mary. “No one could get in.”"
"“是的。”迪肯回答道，“这是个奇怪的地方。我觉得看样子在这十年里头，有人在四处做过些修修剪剪。”","“That’s true,” he answered.“It’s a queer place.Seems to me as if there’d been a bit o’ prunin’ done here an’ there, later than ten year’ ago.”"
"“但是怎么做到的呢？”玛丽问道。","“But how could it have been done?” said Mary."
"他察看着一枝笔直的玫瑰树枝，摇了摇头。","He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head."
"“啊！是怎么做到的呢！”他嘟囔着，“门锁着，钥匙也埋了。”","“Aye! how could it!” he murmured.“With th’ door locked an’ th’ key buried.”"
"玛丽小姐一直都觉得，无论活多久，她都绝不会忘记她的花园开始生长的那个早晨。当然，那个早晨花园似乎开始为她生长。迪肯开始开辟空地种植花籽，玛丽想起了巴兹尔想要捉弄她时唱起的歌。","Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should never forget that first morning when her garden began to grow.Of course, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning.When Dickon began to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease her."
"“什么花儿看起来像风铃呢？”她询问道。","“Are there any flowers that look like bells?” she inquired."
"“铃兰。”他一边回答，一边用泥刀挖地，“坎特伯雷风铃，还有各种风铃草。”","“Lilies o’ th’ valley does,” he answered, digging away with the trowel, “an’ there’s Canterbury bells, an’ campanulas.”"
"“我们种一些吧。”玛丽说。“已经有铃兰了，我看到过。它们会长得太近，我们得把它们分开些。不过已经有足够多了。别的种籽要两年才能开花，不过我可以从我家的花园里给你带些。你为什么想要像风铃的花？”","“Let’s plant some,” said Mary.“There’s lilies o’ th, valley here already; I saw ‘em.They’ll have growed too close an’ we’ll have to separate ‘em, but there’s plenty.Th’ other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some bits o’ plants from our cottage garden.Why does tha’ want ‘em?”"
"于是玛丽给迪肯讲了印度的巴兹尔和他的兄弟姐妹，讲了她当时多么讨厌他们，讨厌他们叫她“玛丽小姐，倔强异常”。","Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India and of how she had hated them and of their calling her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.”"
"“他们常常围着我跳，对着我唱。他们唱道——","“They used to dance round and sing at me.They sang—"
"‘玛丽小姐，倔强非常，你的花园，怎番模样？银色风铃，鸟蛤贝壳，美丽金盏，排成一行。’","‘Mistress Mary, quite contrary,How does your garden grow?With silver bells, and cockle shells,And marigolds all in a row.’"
"我就记得这歌，想知道是不是真有像银色风铃一样的花儿。”","I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells.”"
"她稍稍皱了皱眉，把泥刀往土里狠狠一插。","She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth."
"“我以前没有他们那么别扭。”","“I wasn’t as contrary as they were.”"
"但迪肯笑起来。","But Dickon laughed."
"“啊！”他说着，边弄碎肥沃的黑土，玛丽看到他抬起鼻子嗅它的气味，“有这么美丽的花草，有这么多友好的野东西到处乱跑，为自己建造家、筑着巢、唱着歌、打着口哨，谁还想故意作对呢。你说是不是？”","“Eh!” he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was sniffing up the scent of it.“There doesn’t seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there’s flowers an’ such like, an’ such lots o’ friendly wild things runnin’ about makin’ homes for themselves, or buildin’ nests an’ singin’ an’ whistlin’, does there?”"
"玛丽拿着花籽跪在迪肯身旁，看着他，舒展了眉头。","Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped frowning."
"“迪肯，”她说，“你跟玛莎说的一样好。我喜欢你。你是第五个人。我从没想过自己会喜欢五个人。”","“Dickon,” she said, “you are as nice as Martha said you were.I like you, and you make the fifth person.I never thought I should like five people.”"
"迪肯坐在脚后跟上坐了起来，跟玛莎打磨炉格时一样。他看起来滑稽而又愉快，玛丽想，圆圆的蓝眼睛、红色脸颊、还有那看起来快乐的朝天鼻。","Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the grate.He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose."
"“你只有五个喜欢的人？”迪肯问道，“另外那四个是谁？”","“Only five folk as tha’ likes?” he said. “Who is th’ other four?”"
"“你妈妈和玛莎，”玛丽扳着手指头数着，“还有知更鸟和本·韦瑟斯达夫。”","“Your mother and Martha,” Mary checked them off on her fingers, “and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.”"
"迪肯笑得太大声了，不得不用胳膊捂住嘴挡住声音。","Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his arm over his mouth."
"“我知道你觉得我是个奇怪的家伙。”他说，“但我觉得你才是我见过的最奇怪的小女孩儿。”","“I know tha’ thinks I’m a queer lad,” he said, “but I think tha’ art th’ queerest little lass I ever saw.”"
"这时玛丽做了件奇怪的事情。她身体前倾，问了迪肯一个她以前做梦也想不到会问别人的问题。她试图用约克郡话问，因为那是迪肯的语言。在印度懂土著语言也能取悦土著人。","Then Mary did a strange thing.She leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking any one before.And she tried to ask it in Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a native was always pleased if you knew his speech."
"“内喜欢我吗？”她问道。","“Does tha’ like me?” she said."
"“啊！”迪肯真心实意地回答道，“我当然喜欢。我非常喜欢你。知更鸟也喜欢你，我绝对相信！”","“Eh!” he answered heartily, “that I does.I likes thee wonderful, an’ so does th’ robin, I do believe!”"
"“那就有两个了。”玛丽说，“有两个人喜欢我了。”","“That’s two, then,” said Mary. “That’s two for me.”"
"接下来他们干得更起劲、更开心了。听到院子里的大钟敲中饭时间，玛丽吓了一跳，觉得很惋惜。","And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully.Mary was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner."
"“我不得不走了。”玛丽伤心地说，“你是不是也得走了？”","“I shall have to go,” she said mournfully. “And you will have to go too, won’t you?”"
"迪肯咧嘴笑了。","Dickon grinned."
"“我的饭便于随身携带。”他说，“我妈妈常让我在口袋里放点儿东西。”","“My dinner’s easy to carry about with me,” he said. “Mother always lets me put a bit o’ somethin’ in my pocket.”"
"他从草地上拿起外套，从口袋里掏出个包在一块儿非常干净、粗糙的蓝白手帕里的小包裹。里面有两片厚面包，面包里夹着片什么东西。","He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief.It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them."
"“一般就只是面包。”他说，“但今天有一整块油油的培根。”","“It’s oftenest naught but bread,” he said, “but I’ve got a fine slice o’ fat bacon with it today.”"
"玛丽觉得这饭看起来怪怪的，不过看起来迪肯还颇为享受，准备好好吃一顿。","Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it."
"“快跑回去吃你的饭吧。”迪肯说，“我先把我的吃完。我回家之前还要多干些活儿。”","“Run on an’ get thy victuals,” he said.“I’ll be done with mine first. I’ll get some more work done before I start back home.”"
"他靠着树坐下来。","He sat down with his back against a tree."
"“我准备把知更鸟叫来，”他说，“给它些培根的皮啄一啄。它们很喜欢吃点儿油。”","“I’ll call th’ robin up,” he said, “and give him th’ rind o’ th’ bacon to peck at.They likes a bit o’ fat wonderful.”"
"玛丽一点儿也不想离开他。好像突然间迪肯会变成个森林精灵什么的，等她再回到花园的时候就会不见了。他太好了，好得不真实。她慢慢走向墙上那道门，走到一半，停下来折返了回来。","Mary could scarcely bear to leave him.Suddenly it seemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again.He seemed too good to be true.She went slowly half-way to the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back."
"“无论发生什么事，你——你都绝对不会告诉别人？”她问道。","“Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?” she said."
"刚吃了一大口面包夹培根，迪肯那罂粟般红的脸颊被撑了起来，但他还是设法露出了一个鼓励的微笑。","His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly."
"“如果你是只米瑟斯韦特旷野上的画眉鸟，带我看了你的巢穴在哪里，你觉得我会告诉别人吗？我不会的。”他说，“你就和米瑟斯韦特旷野上的画眉鸟一样安全。”","“If tha’ was a missel thrush an’ showed me where thy nest was, does tha’ think I’d tell any one? Not me,” he said.“Tha’ art as safe as a missel thrush.”"
"如此玛丽很确定自己安全了。","And she was quite sure she was."
"第十二章 “我可以要一点儿泥土吗？”","CHAPTER XII “MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?”"
"玛丽跑得很快，回到房间的时候，已经上气不接下气了。她头发皱巴巴耷拉在额头上，脸蛋是鲜亮的粉色。午饭已经摆在桌子上等着她了，玛莎也在旁边候着。","Mary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her room.Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink.Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near it."
"“你有点儿晚了。”她说，“你去哪儿了？”","“Tha’s a bit late,” she said.“Where has tha’ been?”"
"“我见到迪肯了！”玛丽说，“我见到迪肯了！”","“I’ve seen Dickon!” said Mary.“I’ve seen Dickon!”"
"“我知道他会来。”玛莎欢欣地说，“你觉得他怎么样？”","“I knew he’d come,” said Martha exultantly.“How does tha’ like him?”"
"“我觉得——我觉得他很英俊！”玛丽用很坚决的口吻说道。","“I think—I think he’s beautiful!” said Mary in a determined voice."
"玛莎看起来很意外，不过也很受用。","Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too."
"“嗯，”她说，“他是这世上最好的小伙子，不过我们从不认为他英俊。他的鼻子翘得太厉害了。”","“Well,” she said, “he’s th’ best lad as ever was born, but us never thought he was handsome.His nose turns up too much.”"
"“我喜欢鼻子翘。”玛丽说。","“I like it to turn up,” said Mary."
"“还有他的眼睛那么圆。”玛莎略显疑惑地说道，“虽然颜色还不错。”“我喜欢眼睛圆。”玛丽说，“而且他眼睛的颜色和旷野上天空的颜色一模一样。”","“An’ his eyes is so round,” said Martha, a trifle doubtful.“Though they’re a nice color.”“I like them round,” said Mary.“And they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor.”"
"玛莎满意得眉开眼笑。","Martha beamed with satisfaction."
"“我妈妈说他就是因为总是抬头看飞鸟和云朵，眼睛才变成那颜色的呢。但他有一张大嘴，可不是吗？”","“Mother says he made ‘em that color with always lookin’ up at th’ birds an’ th’ clouds.But he has got a big mouth, hasn’t he, now?”"
"“我喜欢他的大嘴。”玛丽执拗地说，“我希望我自己的嘴也是那样。”","“I love his big mouth,” said Mary obstinately.“I wish mine were just like it.”"
"玛莎高兴地咯咯笑起来。","Martha chuckled delightedly."
"“你那小脸上要长那么大张嘴，会看起来奇怪又滑稽的。”她说，“不过我知道你见到他会是这副样子。你喜欢他带来的花籽和园艺用具吗？”","“It’d look rare an’ funny in thy bit of a face,” she said.“But I knowed it would be that way when tha’ saw him.How did tha’ like th’ seeds an’ th’ garden tools?”"
"“你怎么知道他带来了这些？”玛丽问。","“How did you know he brought them?” asked Mary."
"“啊！我从没想过他会不送来。只要约克郡有，他肯定能带来的。他那么可靠。”","“Eh! I never thought of him not bringin’ ‘em.He’d be sure to bring ‘em if they was in Yorkshire.He’s such a trusty lad.”"
"玛丽担心玛莎接下来可能会问些棘手的问题，不过她没有。她对那些花籽和园艺用具非常感兴趣，只有一刻吓到了玛丽。玛莎开始问这些花儿要种在哪里。","Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but she did not.She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools, and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened.This was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted."
"“你问过谁这个问题？”玛莎询问道。","“Who did tha’ ask about it?” she inquired."
"“我还没来得及问谁呢。”玛丽犹豫了一下，说道。“嗯，我不会去问那个园艺总管。他太傲慢了，罗奇先生就那样。”","“I haven’t asked anybody yet,” said Mary, hesitating.“Well, I wouldn’t ask th’ head gardener.He’s too grand, Mr. Roach is.”"
"“我从没见过他。”玛丽说，“我只见过手下的花匠和本·韦瑟斯达夫。”","“I’ve never seen him,” said Mary.“I’ve only seen undergardeners and Ben Weatherstaff.”"
"“如果我是你，我会去问本·韦瑟斯达夫。”玛莎向她建议，“他面冷心善，大家都觉得他脾气不好。克雷文先生准许他做任何自己想做的事情，是因为克雷文太太还在世的时候他就在这儿了，过去他常常逗太太笑。太太喜欢他。也许他能在哪儿给你找个不挡道的角落。”","“If I was you, I’d ask Ben Weatherstaff,” advised Martha.“He’s not half as bad as he looks, for all he’s so crabbed.Mr. Craven lets him do what he likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an’ he used to make her laugh.She liked him.Perhaps he’d find you a corner somewhere out o’ the way.”"
"“只要不挡道，没人想要，就不会有人介意了对不对？”玛丽急切地问道。","“If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind my having it, could they?”Mary said anxiously."
"“没理由介意。”玛莎回答道，“你又不会妨碍谁。”","“There wouldn’t be no reason,” answered Martha.“You wouldn’t do no harm.”"
"玛丽用最快的速度吃完饭，从桌子旁站起来，跑向自己的房间准备再戴上帽子。但玛莎止住了她。","Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the table she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, but Martha stopped her."
"“我有事儿要告诉你。”玛莎说，“我觉得我应该让你先吃完饭。克雷文先生今早回来了，我觉得他想要见你。”","“I’ve got somethin’ to tell you,” she said.“I thought I’d let you eat your dinner first.Mr. Craven came back this mornin’ and I think he wants to see you.”"
"玛丽的脸变得苍白。","Mary turned quite pale."
"“啊！”她叫道，“为什么！为什么！我来的时候他也没想见我啊。我听皮切尔说他不愿意。”“哦，”玛莎解释说，“梅德洛克太太说是因为我妈妈。妈妈在去斯威特村的路上遇到了他。妈妈从来没跟先生说过话，但克雷文太太去过我家农舍两三次。他忘了，不过我妈妈没忘，她壮着胆子叫住了他。我不知道妈妈跟先生说了些关于你的什么事情，但妈妈的话让他想起来在下次出发之前看看你，他明天走。”","“Oh!” she said. “Why! Why!He didn’t want to see me when I came.I heard Pitcher say he didn’t.”“Well,” explained Martha, “Mrs. Medlock says it’s because o’ mother.She was walkin’ to Thwaite village an’ she met him.She’d never spoke to him before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three times.He’d forgot, but mother hadn’t an’ she made bold to stop him.I don’t know what she said to him about you but she said somethin’ as put him in th’ mind to see you before he goes away again, tomorrow.”"
"“噢！”玛丽喊道，“他明天就走吗？我太高兴了！”","“Oh!” cried Mary, “is he going away tomorrow?I am so glad!”"
"“他要走很长时间。他有可能到秋天或者冬天才回来。他准备去国外旅行。他常常这样。”","“He’s goin’ for a long time.He mayn’t come back till autumn or winter.He’s goin’ to travel in foreign places.He’s always doin’ it.”"
"“噢！我真高兴——真高兴啊！”玛丽感激地说。","“Oh! I’m so glad—so glad!” said Mary thankfully."
"他要是到冬天才回来，即使是秋天，也有足够的时间让她看着秘密花园重现生机了。即使那时他发现了，从她手里把秘密花园夺走，她也至少拥有过不少了。","If he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive.Even if he found out then and took it away from her she would have had that much at least."
"“你觉得他什么时候想见——”","“When do you think he will want to see—”"
"她还没说完，门开了，梅德洛克太太走了进来。她穿着她最好的黑裙子和帽子，领子用一个大胸针别着，胸针上有一个男人的脸的图案。那是去世多年的梅德洛克先生的彩色照片，她盛装的时候总是别着那个胸针。她看起来紧张而又兴奋。","She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs. Medlock walked in.She had on her best black dress and cap, and her collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man’s face on it.It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years ago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up.She looked nervous and excited."
"“你的头发毛糙了。”她语速很快，“去梳一梳。玛莎，去帮她穿上她最好的裙子。克雷文先生让我带她去他书房。”","“Your hair’s rough,” she said quickly.“Go and brush it.Martha, help her to slip on her best dress.Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him in his study.”"
"玛丽脸上的红晕全部褪去了。她的心狂跳，她觉得自己又变回一个僵硬、乏味、安静的小孩儿。她甚至没有回答梅德洛克太太，而是跟在玛莎身后，转身走进了卧室。她换衣服的时候一言不发。头发梳整齐、一切都齐整之后，就跟在梅德洛克太太身后顺着走廊下楼，沉默不语。她有什么可说的呢？她不得不去见克雷文先生。他不会喜欢她的，自己也不会喜欢他。玛丽知道他会怎么想她。","All the pink left Mary’s cheeks.Her heart began to thump and she felt herself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again.She did not even answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom, followed by Martha.She said nothing while her dress was changed, and her hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs. Medlock down the corridors, in silence.What was there for her to say?She was obliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he would not like her, and she would not like him.She knew what he would think of her."
"她被带到大宅里的一处，这里她从没来过。最后梅德洛克太太敲了一扇门，有人说：“进来。”他们就一起走进门去。炉火前有个男人坐在扶手椅里。梅德洛克太太开口对他说话。","She was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before.At last Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when some one said, “Come in,” they entered the room together.A man was sitting in an armchair before the fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him."
"“玛丽小姐来了，先生。”她说。","“This is Miss Mary, sir,” she said."
"“你可以走了，让她留在这里。需要你带她走的时候我会摇铃的。”克雷文先生说。","“You can go and leave her here.I will ring for you when I want you to take her away,” said Mr. Craven."
"梅德洛克太太走出去关上了门。而玛丽只能站在那里等着。一个平庸的小东西，两只细小的手交缠在一起。她能看得出，坐在椅子里的男人不是那么驼背，他肩膀又高又歪，黑发中间杂着白发。他把头从高高的肩膀上转过来，对她说话。","When she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a plain little thing, twisting her thin hands together.She could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high, rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white.He turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her."
"“过来！”他说。","“Come here!” he said."
"玛丽朝他走过去。","Mary went to him."
"他不丑。若不是表情这么悲惨，他的脸可以算得上英俊。他那样子，仿佛看到玛丽就让他痛苦、烦躁，他不知道究竟该把玛丽怎么办。","He was not ugly.His face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable.He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and as if he did not know what in the world to do with her."
"“你还好吗？”他问。","“Are you well?” he asked."
"“还好。”玛丽回答道。","“Yes,” answered Mary."
"“他们把你照料得好吗？”","“Do they take good care of you?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"他暴躁地揉了揉额头，打量着她。","He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over."
"“你很瘦。”他说。","“You are very thin,” he said."
"“我已经在长胖了。”玛丽用自己最生硬的方式回答道。","“I am getting fatter,” Mary answered in what she knew was her stiffest way."
"他那脸真是苦丧着。他那黑眼睛看起来几乎对她视而不见，好像正在看着别的什么东西，他几乎不能把心思放在她身上。","What an unhappy face he had!His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her."
"“我把你给忘了。”他说，“我怎么才能想起你来呢？我本来是想给你找个家庭教师或保姆，或这类的人，但是我忘了。”","“I forgot you,” he said.“How could I remember you?I intended to send you a governess or a nurse, or some one of that sort, but I forgot.”"
"“请你，”玛丽开口说，“请你——”这时喉咙里一口气呛住了她。","“Please,” began Mary.“Please—” and then the lump in her throat choked her."
"“你想说什么？”他询问。","“What do you want to say?” he inquired."
"“我——我已经过了需要保姆的年纪了。”玛丽说，“请你——请你也不要给我找家庭教师。”","“I am—I am too big for a nurse,” said Mary.“And please—please don’t make me have a governess yet.”"
"他又搓了搓额头，盯着她看。","He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her."
"“是那个索尔比家的女人说的。”他心不在焉地喃喃道。","“That was what the Sowerby woman said,” he muttered absentmindedly."
"随后玛丽聚起了少许勇气。","Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage."
"“那是——是玛莎的妈妈吗？”她结结巴巴的。","“Is she—is she Martha’s mother?” she stammered."
"“是，我想是的。”他回答道。","“Yes, I think so,” he replied."
"“她懂得小孩子。”玛丽说道，“她有十二个孩子。她懂。”","“She knows about children,” said Mary.“She has twelve.She knows.”"
"他好像来了精神。","He seemed to rouse himself."
"“你想做什么？”","“What do you want to do?”"
"“我想去户外玩儿。”玛丽回答道，希望自己的声音没有发抖，“我在印度从不喜欢户外活动。在这里户外活动让我有了饥饿感，我也慢慢变胖了。”","“I want to play out of doors,” Mary answered, hoping that her voice did not tremble.“I never liked it in India.It makes me hungry here, and I am getting fatter.”"
"他打量着她。","He was watching her."
"“索尔比说那会对你有好处。也许会吧。”他说道，“她觉得你得先长强壮些，再请家庭教师。”","“Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good.Perhaps it will,” he said.“She thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.”"
"“我玩耍的时候，风从旷野上刮过来，我觉得强壮了起来。”玛丽理论道。","“It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,” argued Mary."
"“你在哪里玩儿？”他接着问。","“Where do you play?” he asked next."
"“哪里都玩儿，”玛丽深吸一口气，“玛莎的妈妈送了我一根跳绳。我跳着跑着——我到处看看有没有东西开始从土里冒出来。我没做不好的事情。”","“Everywhere,” gasped Mary.“Martha’s mother sent me a skipping-rope.I skip and run—and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth.I don’t do any harm.”"
"“别看起来那么害怕。”他担心地说，“你这样一个小孩子，能做什么坏事啊！你可以想干什么就干什么。”","“Don’t look so frightened,” he said in a worried voice.“You could not do any harm, a child like you!You may do what you like.”"
"玛丽把手放到喉咙上，她怕他看到自己过于兴奋而鼓起的喉结。她朝他走近了一步。","Mary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see the excited lump which she felt jump into it.She came a step nearer to him."
"“我可以吗？”她颤抖地说。","“May I?” she said tremulously."
"她那急切的小脸似乎让他更担忧了。","Her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever."
"“别看起来这么害怕。”他呼喊道，“你当然可以。我是你的监护人，虽然对孩子来说我并不称职。我没时间和精力照料你。我病得很重、很沮丧、心烦意乱，但我希望你开心舒适。我对孩子一窍不通，但梅德洛克太太会负责保证你该有的都有。我今天派人带你来，是因为索尔比太太说我应该见见你。她女儿谈起过你。她觉得你需要新鲜空气、自由，需要到处跑。”","“Don’t look so frightened,” he exclaimed.“Of course you may.I am your guardian, though I am a poor one for any child.I cannot give you time or attention.I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish you to be happy and comfortable.I don’t know anything about children, but Mrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need.I sent for you to-day because Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you.Her daughter had talked about you.She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about.”"
"“她很了解孩子。”玛丽又不由自主地说道。","“She knows all about children,” Mary said again in spite of herself."
"“她应该是的。”克雷文先生说，“她够胆大的了，在旷野上拦住我，不过她说克雷文太太以前对他很好。”让他说出亡妻的名字对他来说好像非常艰难。“她是个值得尊敬的女人。现在我见到了你，我觉得她说的有道理。尽量多在户外玩儿吧，随你喜欢。地方那么大，你可以想去哪里就去哪里，想怎么让自己开心就怎么做。你有什么想要的吗？”他好想突然想到了什么，“你需要玩具、书、洋娃娃吗？”","“She ought to,” said Mr. Craven.“I thought her rather bold to stop me on the moor, but she said—Mrs. Craven had been kind to her.”It seemed hard for him to speak his dead wife’s name.“She is a respectable woman.Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things.Play out of doors as much as you like.It’s a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like.Is there anything you want?” as if a sudden thought had struck him.“Do you want toys, books, dolls?”"
"“我可以，”玛丽颤抖着，“我可以要一点儿泥土吗？”","“Might I,” quavered Mary, “might I have a bit of earth?”"
"情急之下，她没有意识到自己的话听起来多么奇怪，这并不是自己本来想说的。克雷文先生看起来很吃惊。","In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound and that they were not the ones she had meant to say.Mr. Craven looked quite startled."
"“泥土！”他重复道，“你是什么意思？”","“Earth!” he repeated.“What do you mean?”"
"“用来种种籽——长东西——看着它们重现生机。”玛丽支吾着。","“To plant seeds in—to make things grow—to see them come alive,” Mary faltered."
"他盯了她一阵，然后迅速把手盖上眼睛。","He gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his eyes."
"“你——你这么关心花园吗？”他慢慢说道。","“Do you—care about gardens so much,” he said slowly."
"“我在印度的时候不懂花园。”玛丽说，“我那时候总是生病、感到疲惫，天气也很热。有时候我会在沙土里堆些小花床，把花插进去。但这里不同。”","“I didn’t know about them in India,” said Mary.“I was always ill and tired and it was too hot.I sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them.But here it is different.”"
"克雷文先生站了起来，开始在房间里慢慢踱步。","Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room."
"“一点儿泥土。”他自言自语着，玛丽觉得不管怎样，她一定是让他回忆起了什么。他停下来对她说话，他黑色的眼睛看起来温柔而友善。","“A bit of earth,” he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she must have reminded him of something.When he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost soft and kind."
"“你想要多少泥土都可以。”他说，“你让我想起了另一个人，她也喜爱泥土和土里长出的东西。看到你自己喜欢的那点儿泥土，”他似是带着微笑，“就拿去吧，孩子，让它活过来。”","“You can have as much earth as you want,” he said.“You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow.When you see a bit of earth you want,” with something like a smile, “take it, child, and make it come alive.”"
"“我可以从任何地方拿吗——如果没人要？”","“May I take it from anywhere—if it’s not wanted?”"
"“任何地方都可以。”他回答道，“好了！你现在得走了，我累了。”他触了铃铛呼唤梅德洛克太太，“再见。我整个夏天都要外出。”","“Anywhere,” he answered.“There!You must go now, I am tired.”He touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock.“Good-by.I shall be away all summer.”"
"梅德洛克太太来得极快，玛丽觉得她一定一直在走廊外候着。","Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have been waiting in the corridor."
"“梅德洛克太太，”克雷文先生对她说，“我现在见过这孩子，知道索尔比太太的意思了。她得先不这么娇弱，再开始上课。给她些简单健康的食物。让她在花园里疯跑。别过分看管她。她需要自由、新鲜的空气、到处跑跳。索尔比太太会不时地来看看她，她有时候也可以去她家农舍。”","“Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Craven said to her, “now I have seen the child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant.She must be less delicate before she begins lessons.Give her simple, healthy food.Let her run wild in the garden.Don’t look after her too much.She needs liberty and fresh air and romping about.Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes go to the cottage.”"
"梅德洛克太太看起来很开心。她听到不需要过分“照看”玛丽，如释重负。她早就觉得照看她是件劳神的差事，事实上已经斗胆尽量少照看她了。除此之外，她也喜欢玛莎的妈妈。","Mrs. Medlock looked pleased.She was relieved to hear that she need not “look after” Mary too much.She had felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her as she dared.In addition to this she was fond of Martha’s mother."
"“谢谢你，先生。”她说，“苏珊·索尔比和我一起上过学。你走上一整天，都碰不到一个像她那么明事理、好心肠的女人。我自己没孩子。她有十二个孩子，都是再健康不过、再好不过的孩子。玛丽小姐从他们那里不会受到不好的影响的。我自己在孩子方面也常常听取苏珊·索尔比的意见。她就是我们所说的“心理健康”的人——不知道您是否明白我的意思。”","“Thank you, sir,” she said.“Susan Sowerby and me went to school together and she’s as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you’d find in a day’s walk.I never had any children myself and she’s had twelve, and there never was healthier or better ones.Miss Mary can get no harm from them.I’d always take Susan Sowerby’s advice about children myself.She’s what you might call healthy-minded—if you understand me.”"
"“我明白。”克雷文先生回答道，“现在带玛丽小姐下去吧，让皮切尔来见我。”","“I understand,” Mr. Craven answered.“Take Miss Mary away now and send Pitcher to me.”"
"梅德洛克太太在走廊尽头跟玛丽分开，玛丽飞奔回自己的房间。她发现玛莎正在那里等自己。事实上，玛莎拿走饭菜后就急忙赶回了这里。","When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew back to her room.She found Martha waiting there.Martha had, in fact, hurried back after she had removed the dinner service."
"“我可以有自己的花园了！”玛丽喊道，“我可以在我喜欢的任何地方拥有一个花园！我很长时间都不会有家庭教师的！你妈妈能来看我，我也能去你家的农舍！他说我这样的小女孩儿做不了什么坏事，我想做什么就做什么——想在哪里就在哪里！”","“I can have my garden!” cried Mary.“I may have it where I like!I am not going to have a governess for a long time!Your mother is coming to see me and I may go to your cottage!He says a little girl like me could not do any harm and I may do what I like—anywhere!”"
"“啊！”玛莎开心地说，“他挺善良的对不对？”","“Eh!” said Martha delightedly, “that was nice of him wasn’t it?”"
"“玛莎，”玛丽严肃地说，“他真是个好心的人，只是他的表情实在是悲惨，前额都抽在了一起。”","“Martha,” said Mary solemnly, “he is really a nice man, only his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.”"
"她用最快的速度跑向花园。她离开的时间比预想的长了很多，她知道迪肯要走五公里回去，需要早点儿出发。她从常春藤下的门溜进去，看到她离开时他在的地方没有人。园艺工具在树下堆在一处。她跑过去，环顾四周，但都没看到迪肯。他走了，秘密花园空了——除了刚飞过墙的知更鸟，它正停在一棵笔直的玫瑰丛上看着她。“他走了。”玛丽可怜地说道，“噢！他——他——他只是个林中精灵吗？”","She ran as quickly as she could to the garden.She had been away so much longer than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would have to set out early on his five-mile walk.When she slipped through the door under the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him.The gardening tools were laid together under a tree.She ran to them, looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen.He had gone away and the secret garden was empty—except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching her.“He’s gone,” she said woefully.“Oh! was he—was he—was he only a wood fairy?”"
"那笔直的玫瑰丛上系了个白色的东西，吸引了她的目光。那是片纸。确切地说，是她帮玛莎描的寄给迪肯的那封信中的一张。纸用一根长刺固定在玫瑰树枝上。玛丽立刻明白那是迪肯留下的了。上面有一些潦草的印刷体字母和一幅画。开始玛丽认不出那是什么意思。后来她看出来画的是一个巢里面蹲了一只鸟。下面是印刷体的字母，写着：","Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye.It was a piece of paper, in fact, it was a piece of the letter she had printed for Martha to send to Dickon.It was fastened on the bush with a long thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there.There were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture.At first she could not tell what it was.Then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it.Underneath were the printed letters and they said:"
"“我会回来的。”","“I will cum bak.”"
"第十三章 “我是柯林”","CHAPTER XIII “I AM COLIN”"
"玛丽回去吃晚饭的时候，把那幅图带回去给玛莎看。","Mary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and she showed it to Martha."
"“啊！”玛莎颇自豪地说，“我以前都不知道我们家迪肯这么聪明。这画的是一个米瑟斯韦特旷野上的画眉鸟坐在巢里，跟实物大小一样，却比实物还逼真两倍。”","“Eh!” said Martha with great pride.“I never knew our Dickon was as clever as that.That there’s a picture of a missel thrush on her nest, as large as life an’ twice as natural.”"
"这时玛丽明白了迪肯是用这幅画传递消息的。他在告诉玛丽请放心，他会替她保守秘密的。她的花园就好比是巢，她就好比那米瑟斯韦特旷野上的画眉鸟。哦，她好喜欢这个奇怪而又普通的男孩儿啊！","Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message.He had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret.Her garden was her nest and she was like a missel thrush.Oh, how she did like that queer, common boy!"
"她希望他第二天就能回来。她是在对第二天早晨的期待中睡着的。","She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning."
"但你永远不知道约克郡的天气将会怎样，特别是在春天。晚上，玛丽被雨点重重拍打在窗户上的声音吵醒了。大雨瓢泼，倾注而下。风声在这所巨大的老房子的各个角落、烟囱里呼啸着。玛丽从床上坐起来，沮丧又生气。","But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly in the springtime.She was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops against her window.It was pouring down in torrents and the wind was “wuthering” round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge old house.Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry."
"“这雨跟我以前一样专爱作对。”她说，“它知道我不愿意它来，就专来。”","“The rain is as contrary as I ever was,” she said.“It came because it knew I did not want it.”"
"她把自己重重摔回枕头里，把脸埋了进去。她没有哭，但躺在那里痛恨着那重重拍下的雨声。她恨风，恨风那“呜啸”的声音。她再也睡不着了。悲伤的声音令她清醒，她也觉得很悲伤。如果她觉得高兴，风声可能已经安抚她入睡了。风“呜啸”得那么响！那么大的雨点倾倒而下，拍打着窗玻璃！","She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face.She did not cry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she hated the wind and its “wuthering.”She could not go to sleep again.The mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself.If she had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep.How it “wuthered” and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane!"
"“这听起来像是个在旷野迷路的人，不停地徘徊、哭喊。”她说。","“It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying,” she said."
"她清醒着躺在床上辗转反侧了大约一个小时。突然有什么声音使她从床上坐了起来，头转向门听着。她听啊听。","She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour, when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door listening.She listened and she listened."
"“现在这不是风。”她几乎喊了出来，“这不是风。风不一样。这是我以前听到过的哭声。”","“It isn’t the wind now,” she said in a loud whisper.“That isn’t the wind.It is different.It is that crying I heard before.”"
"她房间的门半开着，声音从走廊那头传来。那是一种遥远的、模糊的、焦躁不安的哭声。她听了几分钟，一刻比一刻更加肯定了。她觉得她必须找出来那声音是什么。这声音似乎比秘密花园和那埋在地里的钥匙更奇怪。也许此刻的叛逆情绪让她更大胆了一些。她脚离开床，站在地上。","The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful crying.She listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure.She felt as if she must find out what it was.It seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key.Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold.She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor."
"“我要去看看那到底是什么。”她说，“大家都睡了，我不在乎梅德洛克太太——我不在乎！”","“I am going to find out what it is,” she said.“Everybody is in bed and I don’t care about Mrs. Medlock—I don’t care!”"
"玛丽床边有支蜡烛。她拿起蜡烛，蹑手蹑脚地走出房间。走廊看起来很长很黑，但她激动地都顾不了这么多了。她觉得自己记得要在哪个拐角拐弯，就能找到那个有个挂着挂毯的门的短走廊——她迷路那天，梅德洛克太太就是从那走廊穿过来的。那声音就是从那走廊传来的。她拿着昏暗的蜡烛继续走，几乎是凭感觉找路。她心跳得很响，她觉得自己都能听见了。那远处模糊的哭声继续着，引领着她。哭声时不时停下来，然后又响起。该在这个角拐弯吗？她停下来想了想。是的。从这个走廊走下去，左拐，然后上两段宽台阶，再右拐。对，看到那个挂着挂毯的门了。","There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out of the room.The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was too excited to mind that.She thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry—the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost herself.The sound had come up that passage.So she went on with her dim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it.The far-off faint crying went on and led her.Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again.Was this the right corner to turn?She stopped and thought.Yes it was.Down this passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the right again.Yes, there was the tapestry door."
"她轻轻推开门，在身后把门关上。她站在走廊里，哭声虽然不大，却听得清清楚楚。哭声从墙那边传来，在她的左边。再走几码有一道门。她能看到门下透出微微的光线。那个人就在房间里哭着，是个很年轻的人。","She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud.It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there was a door.She could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it.The Someone was crying in that room, and it was quite a young Someone."
"于是她走向门，把门推开，然后就站在那个房间里了！","So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was standing in the room!"
"房间很大，里面有古老的、华丽的家具。微弱的火光黯淡地照在壁炉前的地面上。一个带四角柱、挂着锦缎的雕花床旁边，有一盏夜灯，床上躺着一个小男孩儿，正焦躁地哭着。","It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it.There was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy, crying fretfully."
"玛丽不知道自己是在真实世界，还是又睡着了连做梦都不自知。","Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it."
"男孩儿的脸立体精致，象牙色的脸上，一双大眼睛似乎太大了些。他头发浓密，大卷大卷地盖在额上，使他的瘦脸看上去更小了。他看起来病了很久了。但他哭似乎是因为疲倦和生气，而不是疼痛。","The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have eyes too big for it.He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller.He looked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain."
"玛丽手拿蜡烛站在门边，屏着呼吸。然后她溜过房间。随着她的靠近，灯光吸引了小男孩儿的注意，他转过枕头里的头，瞪着她，灰色的眼睛睁得那么大，似乎深不可测。","Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her breath.Then she crept across the room, and, as she drew nearer, the light attracted the boy’s attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense."
"“你是谁？”他终于半惊吓地低语道，“你是鬼吗？”","“Who are you?” he said at last in a half-frightened whisper.“Are you a ghost?”"
"“不，我不是。”玛丽回答道，她也半受惊吓地低语着，“你是吗？”","“No, I am not,” Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half frightened.“Are you one?”"
"他不停地瞪啊瞪。玛丽忍不住注意到他的眼睛有多奇怪。眼睛周围满是黑色睫毛，一双玛瑙灰的眼睛在他的脸上显得太大了。","He stared and stared and stared.Mary could not help noticing what strange eyes he had.They were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they had black lashes all round them."
"“不是。”他等了大概一阵，回答道，“我是柯林。”","“No,” he replied after waiting a moment or so.“I am Colin.”"
"“谁是柯林？”她结结巴巴地问。","“Who is Colin?” she faltered."
"“我是柯林·克雷文。你是谁？”","“I am Colin Craven.Who are you?”"
"“我是玛丽·伦诺克斯。克雷文先生是我姑父。”","“I am Mary Lennox.Mr. Craven is my uncle.”"
"“他是我爸爸。”柯林说。","“He is my father,” said the boy."
"“你爸爸！”玛丽倒抽了一口气，“没人告诉过我他有个儿子！他们怎么没说呢？”","“Your father!” gasped Mary.“No one ever told me he had a boy!Why didn’t they?”"
"“过来。”他说，奇怪的眼睛始终定在她身上，表情焦虑。","“Come here,” he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her with an anxious expression."
"她走到床边，柯林伸出手摸她。","She came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her."
"“你是真的，对吗？”他说道，“我常常做这么真实的梦。你有可能是其中的一个。”","“You are real, aren’t you?” he said.“I have such real dreams very often.You might be one of them.”"
"玛丽离开房间时套了一件羊毛外套，她把一片衣角放到柯林手指之间。","Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she put a piece of it between his fingers."
"“揉一揉，看看多厚多暖和。”她说，“如果你愿意，我可以掐你一下，让你看看我有多真实。有一刻我也以为你有可能是个梦呢。”","“Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,” she said.“I will pinch you a little if you like, to show you how real I am.For a minute I thought you might be a dream too.”"
"“你从哪里来？”他问道。","“Where did you come from?” he asked."
"“从我自己的房间来。风声呼啸，我睡不着。我听到有人在哭，就想找出来是谁在哭。你为什么哭？”","“From my own room.The wind wuthered so I couldn’t go to sleep and I heard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was.What were you crying for?”"
"“因为我也睡不着，我头疼。再给我说一遍你的名字。”","“Because I couldn’t go to sleep either and my head ached.Tell me your name again.”"
"“玛丽·伦诺克斯。没人告诉你我来这里生活吗？”","“Mary Lennox.Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?”"
"他仍然捏着她衣服的一角，但开始显得有些相信她是真的。","He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look a little more as if he believed in her reality."
"“没有。”他回答道，“他们不敢。”","“No,” he answered.“They daren’t.”"
"“为什么？”玛丽问道。","“Why?” asked Mary."
"“因为我会害怕被你见到。我不愿意让人看到我、跟我说话。”","“Because I should have been afraid you would see me.I won’t let people see me and talk me over.”"
"“为什么？”玛丽又问，越来越觉得迷惑。","“Why?”Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment."
"“因为我总是这样，生病，必须躺着。我爸爸也不让人跟我说话。仆人也不准谈论我。如果能活下来，我也可能是个驼背。但我活不下来。想到我有可能会像他一样，我爸爸就很生气。”","“Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down.My father won’t let people talk me over either.The servants are not allowed to speak about me.If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan’t live.My father hates to think I may be like him.”"
"“哦，这是个多么古怪的房子啊！” 玛丽说道，“多奇怪的房子！一切都是个秘密。房间锁着，花园锁着——你也是！你是被锁着的吧？”","“Oh, what a queer house this is!” Mary said.“What a queer house!Everything is a kind of secret.Rooms are locked up and gardens are locked up—and you!Have you been locked up?”"
"“不是。我呆在这个屋子里是因为我不想被搬出去。那样太累了。”","“No. I stay in this room because I don’t want to be moved out of it.It tires me too much.”"
"“你爸爸来看你吗？”玛丽冒险问道。","“Does your father come and see you?”Mary ventured."
"“有时候。一般都在我睡着的时候。他不喜欢见到我。”","“Sometimes.Generally when I am asleep.He doesn’t want to see me.”"
"“为什么？”玛丽忍不住又问了出来。","“Why?”Mary could not help asking again."
"男孩儿的脸上掠过愤怒的阴影。","A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy’s face."
"“我妈妈生我的时候死了，所以爸爸讨厌看到我。他以为我不知道，但我听到人们在说。他几乎讨厌我。”","“My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me.He thinks I don’t know, but I’ve heard people talking.He almost hates me.”"
"“他讨厌那个花园，因为她死了。”玛丽几乎半是自言自语道。","“He hates the garden, because she died,” said Mary half speaking to herself."
"“什么花园？”男孩儿问道。","“What garden?” the boy asked."
"“哦！只是——只是一个她以前喜欢的花园。”玛丽结结巴巴地说，“你一直都在这里吗？”“几乎是。有时候他们带我到海边的地方，但我呆不下去，因为人们总盯着我看。我以前带着一个钢铁的东西用来撑直我的背，但一个来自伦敦的好医生来看过我，说那样很愚蠢。他让他们把那东西取掉，让我呆在户外新鲜的空气里。我讨厌新鲜空气，我不愿意出去。”","“Oh! just—just a garden she used to like,” Mary stammered.“Have you been here always?”“Nearly always.Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside, but I won’t stay because people stare at me.I used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to see me and said it was stupid.He told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air.I hate fresh air and I don’t want to go out.”"
"“我刚来这里的时候也不喜欢。”玛丽说，“你为什么一直那样看着我？”","“I didn’t when first I came here,” said Mary.“Why do you keep looking at me like that?”"
"“因为那些梦太真实了。”他非常烦躁地回答道，“有时候我睁开眼睛，都不相信自己清醒着。”","“Because of the dreams that are so real,” he answered rather fretfully.“Sometimes when I open my eyes I don’t believe I’m awake.”"
"“我们两个都清醒着。”玛丽说。她扫视了一圈屋子，高高的天花板，阴影满布的角落，和黯淡的火光。“是看起来像梦，半夜三更的，这房子里每个人都睡着了——除了我们。我们非常清醒。”","“We’re both awake,” said Mary.She glanced round the room with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light.“It looks quite like a dream, and it’s the middle of the night, and everybody in the house is asleep—everybody but us.We are wide awake.”"
"“我不希望这是个梦。”男孩儿不安地说。","“I don’t want it to be a dream,” the boy said restlessly."
"玛丽突然想起了什么。","Mary thought of something all at once."
"“如果你不想让人们看到你，”她开口道，“你想让我离开吗？”","“If you don’t like people to see you,” she began, “do you want me to go away?”"
"他还抓着玛丽衣服的一角，又拽了一下。","He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull."
"“不想。”他说，“如果你走了我就能肯定你是个梦了。你要是真的，就在那个高高的脚凳上坐下来，跟我聊天。我想听听你的事情。”","“No,” he said.“I should be sure you were a dream if you went.If you are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk.I want to hear about you.”"
"玛丽把蜡烛放在床边的桌子上，在有靠垫的脚凳上坐下。她一点儿也不想走。她想留在这个神秘的、隐秘的房间里，跟这个神秘的男孩儿说话。","Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the cushioned stool.She did not want to go away at all.She wanted to stay in the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy."
"“你想我跟你说点儿什么？”她说。","“What do you want me to tell you?” she said."
"他想知道她来米瑟斯韦特庄园多久了；想知道她的房间在哪个走廊里；想知道她一直在做些什么；她是否也和自己一样不喜欢旷野；她来约克郡之前住在哪里。她回答了所有这些问题，还有许多别的问题。他背后躺着枕头，听着。他让她讲了很多印度和越洋旅行的事儿。玛丽发现因为他一直身体有病，并没有像其他孩子一样学东西。他还很小的时候，有一个护士教过他读书。他一直在读书，看华丽的书里的图画。","He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted to know which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had been doing; if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had lived before she came to Yorkshire.She answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened.He made her tell him a great deal about India and about her voyage across the ocean.She found out that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things as other children had.One of his nurses had taught him to read when he was quite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures in splendid books."
"虽然他爸爸很少在他醒着的时候来看他，却给了他各种好东西供他娱乐自己。虽然他看起来从未被取悦。他要什么有什么，也从来不被要求做自己不喜欢做的事情。“每个人都必须让我高兴。”他冷漠地说，“我发脾气都会觉得难受。没人相信我能活到长大。”","Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given all sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with.He never seemed to have been amused, however.He could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did not like to do.“Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,” he said indifferently.“It makes me ill to be angry.No one believes I shall live to grow up.”"
"他说着，似乎早已习惯了这个念头，会死这件事也不再会对他造成困扰了。他好像很喜欢玛丽的声音。玛丽说着，他昏昏地、饶有兴趣地听着。有一两次她都怀疑柯林是不是已经渐渐打了起了盹。不过最后他又问了一个问题，打开了一个新话题。","He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him at all.He seemed to like the sound of Mary’s voice.As she went on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way.Once or twice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze.But at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject."
"“你几岁了？”他问。","“How old are you?” he asked."
"“我十岁。”玛丽回答道，一时忘记了自己，“你也是。”","“I am ten,” answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, “and so are you.”"
"“你怎么知道？”他用惊奇的声音问。","“How do you know that?” he demanded in a surprised voice."
"“因为是你出生的时候那花园让锁上，钥匙被埋了起来。现在花园锁了十年了。”","“Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried.And it has been locked for ten years.”"
"柯林半坐了起来，转向她，手肘撑着身子向前倾。","Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows."
"“什么花园的门让锁起来了？谁干的？钥匙埋在哪里？”他呼喊着，仿佛突然间非常感兴趣。","“What garden door was locked?Who did it?Where was the key buried?” he exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested."
"“是——是克雷文先生讨厌的那个花园。”玛丽紧张地说，“他锁上了门。没有人——没有人知道钥匙埋在哪里。”“那是什么样的花园？”柯林急切地追问着。","“It—it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,” said Mary nervously.“He locked the door.No one—no one knew where he buried the key.”“What sort of a garden is it?”Colin persisted eagerly."
"“十年不准人进去了。”玛丽小心翼翼地回答。","“No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,” was Mary’s careful answer."
"但现在小心已经太迟了。他太像自己了。他以前也无事可想，有个隐秘的花园这一想法吸引了他，就像当初吸引了玛丽一样。他一个接一个地问问题。那花园在哪里？她去找过门吗？她问过花匠吗？","But it was too late to be careful.He was too much like herself.He too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it had attracted her.He asked question after question.Where was it?Had she never looked for the door?Had she never asked the gardeners?"
"“他们不会谈论这个的。”玛丽说，“我想有人告诉他们不许回答问题。”","“They won’t talk about it,” said Mary.“I think they have been told not to answer questions.”"
"“我能让他们回答。”柯林说。","“I would make them,” said Colin."
"“你可以吗？”玛丽结结巴巴地说，她开始感到害怕了。要是他能让他们回答问题，谁知道会发生什么！","“Could you?”Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened.If he could make people answer questions, who knew what might happen!"
"“每个人都必须取悦我。我告诉过你的。”他说，“要是我活下来，这个地方总有一天会属于我。他们都知道。我能让他们告诉我。”","“Everyone is obliged to please me.I told you that,” he said.“If I were to live, this place would sometime belong to me.They all know that.I would make them tell me.”"
"玛丽原来不知道自己被惯坏了，但她很清楚地知道这个神秘的小男孩儿被惯坏了。他认为全世界都属于自己。他多么怪异，说起自己活不长时的语气又是多么冷漠。","Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could see quite plainly that this mysterious boy had been.He thought that the whole world belonged to him.How peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living."
"“你认为自己活不长吗？”她问，一半出于好奇，一半是希望让他忘记这个花园。","“Do you think you won’t live?” she asked, partly because she was curious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden."
"“我不期待能活长。”他回答道，跟刚才说话的语气一样冷漠，“从我记事起，我就听人们说我活不久。开始他们觉得我小听不懂，现在他们觉得我听不到。但是我能。我的医生是我爸爸的表弟。他很穷。如果我死了，他就会在我爸爸死后继承米瑟斯韦特庄园。我有理由相信他不想我活下来。”","“I don’t suppose I shall,” he answered as indifferently as he had spoken before.“Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say I shan’t.At first they thought I was too little to understand and now they think I don’t hear.But I do.My doctor is my father’s cousin.He is quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my father is dead.I should think he wouldn’t want me to live.”"
"“你想活下来吗？”玛丽询问道。","“Do you want to live?” inquired Mary."
"“不想。”他回答道，一副乖戾、疲倦的样子，“但我不想死。我觉得不舒服的时候就会躺在这里，想着这事儿，然后就开始哭啊哭。”","“No,” he answered, in a cross, tired fashion.“But I don’t want to die.When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry.”"
"“我听到你哭三次了。”玛丽说，“但我不知道是谁。你是为这事儿哭吗？”她的确太想让他忘记那花园了。","“I have heard you crying three times,” Mary said, “but I did not know who it was.Were you crying about that?”She did so want him to forget the garden."
"“我敢说是的。”他回答道，“让我们说点儿别的。说说那花园。你不想看看那花园吗？”","“I dare say,” he answered.“Let us talk about something else.Talk about that garden.Don’t you want to see it?”"
"“想。”玛丽回答道，声音非常低。","“Yes,” answered Mary, in quite a low voice."
"“我想。”他很固执地继续，“我以前从没真的想去看些什么，但我想看看那个花园。我想把钥匙挖出来。我想把门打开。我可以让他们把我用椅子抬过去。这也是呼吸新鲜空气。我打算让他们把门打开。”","“I do,” he went on persistently.“I don’t think I ever really wanted to see anything before, but I want to see that garden.I want the key dug up.I want the door unlocked.I would let them take me there in my chair.That would be getting fresh air.I am going to make them open the door.”"
"他已经变得非常激动，他奇怪的眼睛开始像星星一样闪烁，看起来更加深邃了。","He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like stars and looked more immense than ever."
"“他们必须取悦我。”他说，“我会让他们带我去那儿，我也让你去。”","“They have to please me,” he said.“I will make them take me there and I will let you go, too.”"
"玛丽双手紧握。一切都会毁掉的——所有的一切！迪肯永远不会回来了。她永远也不会像在米瑟斯韦特旷野上有个安全隐藏的窝的画眉鸟那样感到安全了。","Mary’s hands clutched each other.Everything would be spoiled—everything!Dickon would never come back.She would never again feel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest."
"“噢，不要——不要——不要那么做！”她喊了出来。","“Oh, don’t—don’t—don’t—don’t do that!” she cried out."
"他盯着她，好像觉得她发疯了一样。","He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!"
"“为什么？”他呼喊，“你说过你想看它的。”","“Why?” he exclaimed.“You said you wanted to see it.”"
"“我是想。”她几乎喉头哽咽地回答道，“但如果你让他们打开门，那样把你带进去，那就永远不是秘密了。”","“I do,” she answered almost with a sob in her throat, “but if you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret again.”"
"他又往前倾了一些。","He leaned still farther forward."
"“一个秘密。”他说，“你什么意思？告诉我。”","“A secret,” he said. “What do you mean? Tell me.”"
"玛丽几乎是跌跌撞撞地说着。","Mary’s words almost tumbled over one another."
"“你看——你看，”她喘着气，“如果除了我们没人知道——如果有一个门隐藏在常春藤下面某个地方——假使有——并且我们能找得到；如果我们能一起从那门溜进去，把门在身后关上，没人知道有人在里面，我们可以把它叫做我们的花园，可以假装——假装我们是米瑟斯韦特旷野上的画眉鸟，那里是我们的巢穴，如果我们整天在那里玩耍，挖土种种籽，让一切都活起来——”","“You see—you see,” she panted, “if no one knows but ourselves—if there was a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy—if there was—and we could find it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind us, and no one knew any one was inside and we called it our garden and pretended that—that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and if we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it all come alive—”"
"“它死了吗？”柯林打断了玛丽。","“Is it dead?” he interrupted her."
"“要是没人照料，它很快就会死掉的。”她继续说，“球茎能活下来，但玫瑰——”","“It soon will be if no one cares for it,” she went on.“The bulbs will live but the roses—”"
"他又一次打断了玛丽，就跟玛丽自己最初一样激动。","He stopped her again as excited as she was herself."
"“球茎是什么？”他快速插话。","“What are bulbs?” he put in quickly."
"“是水仙、百合、和雪花莲。它们现在就在土里生长着——冒出暗绿色的小点儿，因为春天快来了。”","“They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops.They are working in the earth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.”"
"“春天快来了吗？”他问，“春天是什么样子？生病在屋子里看不到。”","“Is the spring coming?” he said.“What is it like?You don’t see it in rooms if you are ill.”"
"“春天就是太阳照进雨水，雨水落在阳光里，植物往出冒，在地下生长。”玛丽回答说，“如果这花园能保密，我们能进去，我们就能看着植物一天天长大，看有多少玫瑰还活着。你不明白吗？噢，你还不明白如果这是个秘密该有多好？”","“It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine, and things pushing up and working under the earth,” said Mary.“If the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive.Don’t you see?Oh, don’t you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?”"
"他跌回枕头里，躺在那里，脸上表情古怪。","He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on his face."
"“我从来没有秘密。”他说，“除了知道我自己活不到长大。他们不知道我知道，所以这也算是个秘密吧。但我更喜欢这种秘密。”","“I never had a secret,” he said, “except that one about not living to grow up.They don’t know I know that, so it is a sort of secret.But I like this kind better.”"
"“如果你不让他们带你去那个花园，”玛丽央求道，“也许——我几乎可以肯定我总有一天能找到进去的办法。到那时——如果医生想让你坐在椅子里去户外，并且你总能做自己想做的，也许——也许我们能找个男孩儿推你，我们单独去那里，这样那里就可以永远是个秘密花园了。”","“If you won’t make them take you to the garden,” pleaded Mary, “perhaps—I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime.And then—if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you can always do what you want to do, perhaps—perhaps we might find some boy who would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a secret garden.”"
"“我应该——喜欢——那样。”他说得非常慢，眼睛看起来很朦胧，“我应该喜欢那样。我应该不介意在秘密花园里呼吸新鲜空气。”","“I should—like—that,” he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy.“I should like that.I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.”"
"玛丽喘过一口气，觉得安全了些。看来他也中意保守秘密。她几乎可以肯定，如果她继续说下去，让他在脑海里看到自己看到的那个花园，他会非常喜欢它，决不能忍受随便什么人都能想进去就进去践踏它了。","Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him.She felt almost sure that if she kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as she had seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose."
"“我来给你讲讲我觉得它会是什么样子的，如果我们能进去的话。”她说，“它已经被锁了那么久，东西或许已经都打结在一起了。”","“I’ll tell you what I think it would be like, if we could go into it,” she said.“It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle perhaps.”"
"他静静地躺着，听玛丽讲那些玫瑰。玫瑰或许已经费力地从一棵树爬到另一棵，垂挂下来——有很多鸟或许已经在那里筑巢了，因为那里很安全。接下来，她给他讲知更鸟和本·韦瑟斯达夫。关于知更鸟有很多可讲的，讲它也容易又安全，所以玛丽渐渐不害怕了。知更鸟的故事让柯林很是开心，他笑了，甚至看起来都英俊了起来。起初玛丽曾认为柯林比自己长得还要平凡，大眼睛、浓密的卷发。","He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the roses which might have clambered from tree to tree and hung down—about the many birds which might have built their nests there because it was so safe.And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid.The robin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair."
"“我从不知道鸟儿还可以这样。”他说，“但如果你呆在屋子里，你永远看不到这些。你知道的可真多。我觉得你好像已经进去过那花园一样。”","“I did not know birds could be like that,” he said.“But if you stay in a room you never see things.What a lot of things you know.I feel as if you had been inside that garden.”"
"她不知道该说些什么，所以就什么也没说。很显然，他并不期待回答。下一刻他让玛丽吃了一惊。","She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything.He evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise."
"“我打算让你看样东西。”他说，“你看到墙上炉台上方挂着的那玫瑰色的丝质窗帘了吗？”","“I am going to let you look at something,” he said.“Do you see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?”"
"玛丽原先没有注意到，但她现在抬头看到了。那是个柔软的丝质窗帘，挂在似乎是什么画上。","Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it.It was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture."
"“看到了。”她回答。","“Yes,” she answered."
"“那上面挂着个细绳儿。”柯林说，“过去拉一下。”","“There is a cord hanging from it,” said Colin.“Go and pull it.”"
"玛丽很困惑。她站起来找到了那根绳子。她拉了一下那绳子，丝帘绕着环往上卷，一直卷，直到露出一幅画。那是一个微笑的小女孩儿的画像。她明亮的头发用蓝色丝带系着，欢乐可爱的眼睛跟柯林那不开心的眼睛简直一模一样，玛瑙灰，由于周围一圈有黑色睫毛，看起来足足有实际的两倍那么大。","Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord.When she pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture.It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face.She had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin’s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the black lashes all round them."
"“她是我妈妈。”柯林抱怨地说，“我不知道为什么她要死。有时候我恨她为什么死了。”","“She is my mother,” said Colin complainingly.“I don’t see why she died.Sometimes I hate her for doing it.”"
"“好奇怪！”玛丽说。","“How queer!” said Mary."
"“如果她还活着，我相信我也不会一直生病。”他抱怨着，“我保证我也能活下来。我爸爸也不会讨厌看到我了。我保证我也会有个强壮的后背。把帘子拉回去吧。”","“If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,” he grumbled.“I dare say I should have lived, too.And my father would not have hated to look at me.I dare say I should have had a strong back.Draw the curtain again.”"
"玛丽照做了，然后回到脚凳旁。","Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool."
"“她比你漂亮多了。”她说，“但她的眼睛和你一模一样——至少形状和颜色是一样的。为什么用帘子盖着她的画像？”","“She is much prettier than you,” she said, “but her eyes are just like yours—at least they are the same shape and color.Why is the curtain drawn over her?”"
"他不舒服地移动了一下。","He moved uncomfortably."
"“我让他们这么做的。”他说，“有时候我不喜欢看到她看着我。我生病难过的时候她笑得太多了。另外，她是我的，我不想让随便什么人都能看到她。”有几刻沉默，然后玛丽开口道。","“I made them do it,” he said.“Sometimes I don’t like to see her looking at me.She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable.Besides, she is mine and I don’t want everyone to see her.”There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke."
"“如果梅德洛克太太发现我来过这里，她会怎么做？”她询问。","“What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?” she inquired."
"“她会照我的指示办。”他回答道，“我会告诉她我想让你每天来和我聊天。我高兴你来了。”","“She would do as I told her to do,” he answered.“And I should tell her that I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day.I am glad you came.”"
"“我也是。”玛丽说，“我会尽量常来，但”——她犹豫了一下——“我得天天去找那花园的门。”","“So am I,” said Mary.“I will come as often as I can, but”—she hesitated—“I shall have to look every day for the garden door.”"
"“是，你必须去。”柯林说，“这样以后你就能告诉我了。”","“Yes, you must,” said Colin, “and you can tell me about it afterward.”"
"他躺在那里想了几分钟，正如他以前所做，然后他又开口了。","He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spoke again."
"“我觉得你也必须是个秘密。”他说，“除非他们发现，我是不会告诉他们的。我可以常常把护士支开，说我想一个人呆着。你认识玛莎吗？”","“I think you shall be a secret, too,” he said.“I will not tell them until they find out.I can always send the nurse out of the room and say that I want to be by myself.Do you know Martha?”"
"“我认识，我和她很熟。”玛丽说，“她服侍我。”","“Yes, I know her very well,” said Mary.“She waits on me.”"
"他朝外面的走廊点了点头。","He nodded his head toward the outer corridor."
"“她就睡在另一间房里。护士昨天走了，晚上要和她姐姐过夜。每次她外出的时候，就让玛莎照顾我。玛莎会告诉你什么时候过来。”","“She is the one who is asleep in the other room.The nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha attend to me when she wants to go out.Martha shall tell you when to come here.”"
"此刻玛丽明白为什么她问起这哭声的时候，玛莎总是面露难色了。","Then Mary understood Martha’s troubled look when she had asked questions about the crying."
"“玛莎一直都知道你？”她问。","“Martha knew about you all the time?” she said."
"“是的，她常常服侍我。护士喜欢离开，那时玛莎就会过来。”","“Yes; she often attends to me.The nurse likes to get away from me and then Martha comes.”"
"“我已经来了很久了。”玛丽说，“我该走了吧。我看你眼睛打架了。”","“I have been here a long time,” said Mary.“Shall I go away now?Your eyes look sleepy.”"
"“我希望我可以在你走之前睡着。”他非常害羞地说道。","“I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,” he said rather shyly."
"“闭上眼睛。”玛丽说，把脚凳拉近了些，“我会做我在印度的时候奶妈做的事情。我会拍你的手、抚摸着、低低地唱歌。”","“Shut your eyes,” said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, “and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India.I will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something quite low.”"
"“也许我会喜欢那样。”他昏昏欲睡地说。","“I should like that perhaps,” he said drowsily."
"不知怎么的，她可怜他，不想让他醒着躺在那里。她倾身靠着床，开始拍打抚摸他的手，吟唱一首很低的印度语歌谣。","Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so she leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little chanting song in Hindustani."
"“很好听。”他说，更加困倦了。她继续吟唱、抚摸，然而她再看他时，他黑色的睫毛已经紧贴在脸颊，因为他眼睛已经闭上，睡熟了。于是她轻轻起身，拿着蜡烛，没有半点声响地溜走了。","“That is nice,” he said more drowsily still, and she went on chanting and stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes were lying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast asleep.So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away without making a sound."
"第十四章 小王爷","CHAPTER XIV A YOUNG RAJAH"
"清晨到来时，整个旷野都笼罩在暮霭里。雨还在下个不停。外出泡汤了。玛莎忙碌着，玛丽都找不到机会跟她说话。不过下午的时候，玛丽叫她来幼儿室跟她一起坐坐。她来的时候带来了她没事做的时候总是在织的袜子。","The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not stopped pouring down.There could be no going out of doors.Martha was so busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery.She came bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing nothing else."
"“你怎么了？”两人一坐下来玛莎就问道，“你好像有事情要讲。”","“What’s the matter with thee?” she asked as soon as they sat down.“Tha’ looks as if tha’d somethin’ to say.”"
"“我是有事情。我查出那哭声是怎么回事儿了。”玛丽说。","“I have.I have found out what the crying was,” said Mary."
"玛莎任由针线活儿落在膝盖上，她盯着玛丽，目瞪口呆。","Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled eyes."
"“你不可能！”她惊呼，“绝不可能！”","“Tha’ hasn’t!” she exclaimed.“Never!”"
"“我晚上听到了。”玛丽继续说，“所以我就起来去看看那声音来自哪里。是柯林。我找到他了。”","“I heard it in the night,” Mary went on.“And I got up and went to see where it came from.It was Colin.I found him.”"
"玛莎的脸惊恐得变红了。","Martha’s face became red with fright."
"“啊！玛丽小姐！”她半哭着说，“你不应该那么做——你不应该！这会给我带来麻烦的。我从没跟你讲过他的事情——但你会给我带来麻烦的。我一定会丢掉工作的，我妈妈怎么办啊！”","“Eh! Miss Mary!” she said half crying.“Tha’ shouldn’t have done it—tha’ shouldn’t!Tha’ll get me in trouble.I never told thee nothin’ about him—but tha’ll get me in trouble.I shall lose my place and what’ll mother do!”"
"“你不会丢掉工作的。”玛丽说，“他很高兴我去。我们聊天了，他说他很高兴我去了。”","“You won’t lose your place,” said Mary.“He was glad I came.We talked and talked and he said he was glad I came.”"
"“他高兴吗？”玛莎叫道，“你肯定？你是不知道他被惹怒的时候是什么样子。他是个大小伙子了，哭起来像个婴儿。但他发起火来那尖利的声音能吓到我们。他知道我们不敢随心所欲。”","“Was he?” cried Martha.“Art tha’ sure?Tha’ doesn’t know what he’s like when anything vexes him.He’s a big lad to cry like a baby, but when he’s in a passion he’ll fair scream just to frighten us.He knows us daren’t call our souls our own.”"
"“他没有被惹怒。”玛丽说，“我问他我是不是该走开，他让我留下。他问我问题，我坐在一个大脚凳上，给他讲印度、讲知更鸟和花园。他不让我走。他让我看他妈妈的画像。我走之前还给他唱了歌哄他入睡了。”","“He wasn’t vexed,” said Mary.“I asked him if I should go away and he made me stay.He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool and talked to him about India and about the robin and gardens.He wouldn’t let me go.He let me see his mother’s picture.Before I left him I sang him to sleep.”"
"玛莎很惊奇地倒抽了一口气。","Martha fairly gasped with amazement."
"“我简直不能相信你！”她提出异议，“这就像径直走进了狮子笼。要是换作平时，他会突然大怒，把整个房子掀起来的。他不让陌生人见他。”","“I can scarcely believe thee!” she protested.“It’s as if tha’d walked straight into a lion’s den.If he’d been like he is most times he’d have throwed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th’ house.He won’t let strangers look at him.”"
"“他让我看他。我一直看着他，他也看着我。我们盯着对方看！”玛丽说。","“He let me look at him.I looked at him all the time and he looked at me.We stared!” said Mary."
"“我不知道该怎么办了！”玛莎不安地喊了出来，“如果被梅德洛克太太发现了，她会认为是我不守规矩，告诉你的。我就要收拾包裹回家见妈妈了。”","“I don’t know what to do!” cried agitated Martha.“If Mrs. Medlock finds out, she’ll think I broke orders and told thee and I shall be packed back to mother.”"
"“他暂时不会给梅德洛克太太透露一点儿的。这一开始会是个秘密。”玛丽坚定地说，“他也说了，每个人都要照他的喜好办事。”","“He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet.It’s to be a sort of secret just at first,” said Mary firmly.“And he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases.”"
"“啊，这倒是真的——这个坏孩子！”玛莎叹气道，用围裙擦了擦额头。","“Aye, that’s true enough—th’ bad lad!” sighed Martha, wiping her forehead with her apron."
"“他说梅德洛克太太必须这样。他想让我每天都去跟他说话。他想让我去的时候，就让你来告诉我。”","“He says Mrs. Medlock must.And he wants me to come and talk to him every day.And you are to tell me when he wants me.”"
"“我？！”玛莎说，“我会丢掉工作的——一定会的！”","“Me!” said Martha; “I shall lose my place—I shall for sure!”"
"“你照他说的去做，就不会的。每个人都要服从他的命令。”玛丽辩解。","“You can’t if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is ordered to obey him,” Mary argued."
"“你不会意思是说，”玛莎双眼圆睁，喊了出来，“他对你很友好吧！”","“Does tha’ mean to say,” cried Martha with wide open eyes, “that he was nice to thee!”"
"“我觉得他几乎喜欢我。”玛丽回答道。","“I think he almost liked me,” Mary answered."
"“那你一定是蛊惑了他！”玛莎深吸了一口气，下了定论。","“Then tha’ must have bewitched him!” decided Martha, drawing a long breath."
"“你的意思是魔法吗？”玛丽询问，“我在印度听说过魔法，但我不会使魔法。我只是走进他的房间，看到他我很惊奇，就站在那里盯着他。然后他也转身盯着我。他认为我是个鬼或者是梦，我以为他说不定也是。大半夜的不认识的两个人单独在一起，真的非常奇怪。我们开始互相问对方问题。我问他我是不是需要走开，他说不要。”","“Do you mean Magic?” inquired Mary.“I’ve heard about Magic in India, but I can’t make it.I just went into his room and I was so surprised to see him I stood and stared.And then he turned round and stared at me.And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was.And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other.And we began to ask each other questions.And when I asked him if I must go away he said I must not.”"
"“真是世界末日来了！”玛莎倒抽了一口气。","“Th’ world’s comin’ to a end!” gasped Martha."
"“他怎么了？”玛丽问。","“What is the matter with him?” asked Mary."
"“没人确切地知道是怎么回事。”玛莎说，“他出生的时候，克雷文先生已经六神无主了。医生一度认为他需要进疯人院。因为克雷文太太死了，我告诉过你的。他不肯看那孩子一眼。他只是胡言乱语，说这孩子又会是一个像他一样的驼背，最好死了。”","“Nobody knows for sure and certain,” said Martha.“Mr. Craven went off his head like when he was born.Th’ doctors thought he’d have to be put in a ‘sylum.It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you.He wouldn’t set eyes on th’ baby.He just raved and said it’d be another hunchback like him and it’d better die.”"
"“柯林是驼背吗？”玛丽问，“他看起来不像。”","“Is Colin a hunchback?”Mary asked.“He didn’t look like one.”"
"“他还不是。”玛莎说，“但他一开始就没开好头。妈妈说这房子里有太多麻烦和怨气，是小孩儿都会不好的。他们担心他的背不结实，一直小心照料着——让他一直躺着，不让他走路。他们一度还让他戴上一个支架，但他生气得从此彻底病倒了。后来一个大医生来看他，他让他们把支架取掉了。他把那些医生狠狠教训了一番——用礼貌的态度。他说用药太多了，太由着他的性子了。”","“He isn’t yet,” said Martha.“But he began all wrong.Mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th’ house to set any child wrong.They was afraid his back was weak an’ they’ve always been takin’ care of it—keepin’ him lyin’ down and not lettin’ him walk.Once they made him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill.Then a big doctor came to see him an’ made them take it off.He talked to th’ other doctor quite rough—in a polite way.He said there’d been too much medicine and too much lettin’ him have his own way.”"
"“我觉得他完全就是个被惯坏的男孩儿。”玛丽说。","“I think he’s a very spoiled boy,” said Mary."
"“他是我见过最差劲的男孩儿！”玛莎说，“若不是他总生病，我也不会这么说。有两三次，咳嗽感冒几乎要了他的命。有一次他得了风湿热，还有一次得了伤寒。啊！梅德洛克太太当时吓坏了。他一直都昏迷着，梅德洛克太太和护士说着话，以为他什么也听不到，她说：‘他这次肯定要死了，这对大家和他自己都最好。’然后她去瞧他，发现他在那里睁大眼睛瞪着她，就像她自己一样清醒。她不知道会发生什么，但他就那么瞪着她，说：‘你，给我点儿水，闭嘴。’”","“He’s th’ worst young nowt as ever was!” said Martha.“I won’t say as he hasn’t been ill a good bit.He’s had coughs an’ colds that’s nearly killed him two or three times.Once he had rheumatic fever an’ once he had typhoid.Eh!Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then.He’d been out of his head an’ she was talkin’ to th’ nurse, thinkin’ he didn’t know nothin’, an’ she said, ‘He’ll die this time sure enough, an’ best thing for him an’ for everybody.’An’ she looked at him an’ there he was with his big eyes open, starin’ at her as sensible as she was herself.She didn’t know wha’d happen but he just stared at her an’ says, ‘You give me some water an’ stop talkin’.’”"
"“你觉得他会死吗？”玛丽问。","“Do you think he will die?” asked Mary."
"“我妈妈说如果小孩子不呼吸新鲜空气，什么也不做就那么平躺着看图画书、吃药，都活不下来的。他很孱弱，讨厌被抬出去，觉得很麻烦。他很容易感冒，说那让他很难受。”","“Mother says there’s no reason why any child should live that gets no fresh air an’ doesn’t do nothin’ but lie on his back an’ read picture-books an’ take medicine.He’s weak and hates th’ trouble o’ bein’ taken out o’ doors, an’ he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill.”"
"玛丽坐下注视着炉火。“我想，”她慢慢说道，“到外面花园里看植物生长会不会对他有好处。对我就有好处。”","Mary sat and looked at the fire.“I wonder,” she said slowly, “if it would not do him good to go out into a garden and watch things growing.It did me good.”"
"“他最厉害的一次发作，”玛莎说，“是有一次他们把他抬到外面喷泉旁边的玫瑰那里。他在文章里读到过人们得的一种叫做“玫瑰寒”的病。所以他开始打喷嚏时，就说自己也得了这种病。一个新来的园丁不懂规矩，路过时好奇地看了他一眼。他勃然大怒，说他看自己是因为自己要长成个驼背。他哭得发起了烧，病了一夜。”","“One of th’ worst fits he ever had,” said Martha, “was one time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain.He’d been readin’ in a paper about people gettin’ somethin’ he called ‘rose cold’ an’ he began to sneeze an’ said he’d got it an’ then a new gardener as didn’t know th’ rules passed by an’ looked at him curious.He threw himself into a passion an’ he said he’d looked at him because he was going to be a hunchback.He cried himself into a fever an’ was ill all night.”"
"“他要是对我发脾气，我永远也不会再去见他了。”玛丽说。","“If he ever gets angry at me, I’ll never go and see him again,” said Mary."
"“他想让你去就让你去。”玛莎说，“这你也许一开始就知道了。”","“He’ll have thee if he wants thee,” said Martha.“Tha’ may as well know that at th’ start.”"
"过了没多久，铃响了，玛莎裹起自己的针线活。","Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting."
"“我敢说是护士想让我陪他呆会儿。”她说，“我希望他现在情绪好。”","“I dare say th’ nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,” she said.“I hope he’s in a good temper.”"
"她出去了大约十分钟，然后带着困惑的表情回来了。","She was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with a puzzled expression."
"“好吧，他已经被你迷住了。”她说，“他在沙发上坐着，看图画书呢。他让护士六点前都不要回来。我则要去隔壁房间等着。护士刚一走，他就叫来我，告诉我说：‘我想要玛丽·伦诺克斯过来和我聊天，记得不要告诉任何人。’你最好尽快过去。”","“Well, tha’ has bewitched him,” she said.“He’s up on his sofa with his picture-books.He’s told the nurse to stay away until six o’clock.I’m to wait in the next room.Th’ minute she was gone he called me to him an’ says, ‘I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and remember you’re not to tell any one.’You’d better go as quick as you can.”"
"玛丽很乐意快点儿过去。她并没有像想见到迪肯那样想见到柯林，不过也很想见他。","Mary was quite willing to go quickly.She did not want to see Colin as much as she wanted to see Dickon; but she wanted to see him very much."
"玛丽走进房间时，壁炉里的火烧得很旺。她看到这房间在日光下真是美丽。小毯子、挂饰、墙上的书和画都有着丰富的颜色，使得这房子在阴暗的雨天都显得那么温暖而舒适。柯林自己看起来就很像是一幅画。他裹着一件天鹅绒晨袍，坐靠在一个大锦缎靠枕上。他双颊两侧各有一个红团。","There was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room, and in the daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed.There were rich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain.Colin looked rather like a picture himself.He was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion.He had a red spot on each cheek."
"“进来。”他说，“我一早上都想着你呢。”","“Come in,” he said.“I’ve been thinking about you all morning.”"
"“我也一直在想着你。”玛丽说，“你都不知道玛莎有多害怕。她说梅德洛克太太会认为是她告诉了我你的事情，然后她就会被打发走。”","“I’ve been thinking about you, too,” answered Mary.“You don’t know how frightened Martha is.She says Mrs. Medlock will think she told me about you and then she will be sent away.”"
"他皱了皱眉。","He frowned."
"“去把她找来。”他说，“她在隔壁房间。”","“Go and tell her to come here,” he said.“She is in the next room.”"
"玛丽去把玛莎找了回来。可怜的玛莎双脚都在打颤。柯林仍皱着眉。","Mary went and brought her back.Poor Martha was shaking in her shoes.Colin was still frowning."
"“你是不是必须要做让我高兴的事情？”他问道。","“Have you to do what I please or have you not?” he demanded."
"“是的先生，我必须做让您高兴的事儿。”玛莎支吾着，脸都变红了。","“I have to do what you please, sir,” Martha faltered, turning quite red."
"“梅德洛克是不是必须做让我高兴的事情？”","“Has Medlock to do what I please?”"
"“每个人都必须让您高兴，先生。”玛莎回答。","“Everybody has, sir,” said Martha."
"“好，那么，如果我命令你去把玛丽小姐带来，即使梅德洛克发现了，怎么能打发你走呢？”","“Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlock send you away if she finds it out?”"
"“请您不要让她发现，先生。”玛莎乞求道。","“Please don’t let her, sir,” pleaded Martha."
"“如果她敢对这件事有任何异议，我会打发她走。”克雷文小主子傲慢地说，“我可以告诉你，她不会喜欢那样的。”","“I’ll send her away if she dares to say a word about such a thing,” said Master Craven grandly.“She wouldn’t like that, I can tell you.”"
"“谢谢您，先生。”玛莎飞快地行了个屈膝礼，“我想尽我的职责，先生。”","“Thank you, sir,” bobbing a curtsy, “I want to do my duty, sir.”"
"“我就是要你尽职责。”柯林更加庄重地说道，“我会保证你的安全的。现在出去吧。”","“What I want is your duty” said Colin more grandly still.“I’ll take care of you.Now go away.”"
"门在玛莎身后关上，柯林发现玛丽小姐正盯着自己，好像是他做了什么让她不解的事情。","When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing at him as if he had set her wondering."
"“你为什么那样看着我？”他问玛丽，“你在想什么？”","“Why do you look at me like that?” he asked her.“What are you thinking about?”"
"“我在想两件事。”","“I am thinking about two things.”"
"“是什么事情？坐下来告诉我。”","“What are they?Sit down and tell me.”"
"“第一件事是，”玛丽说着，在大脚凳上坐了下来，“在印度的时候有一次我见到一个小男孩儿，他是个王爷。他浑身镶满了红宝石、绿宝石、钻石。他和他的手下说话时的口气就像你刚才同玛莎说话一样。每个人都必须做他吩咐的每一件事——立刻就做。我想如果他们没做就会被杀死。”","“This is the first one,” said Mary, seating herself on the big stool.“Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah.He had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him.He spoke to his people just as you spoke to Martha.Everybody had to do everything he told them—in a minute.I think they would have been killed if they hadn’t.”"
"“我想让你等一下给我讲讲印度王爷。”他说，“但先告诉我第二件事情是什么。”","“I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,” he said, “but first tell me what the second thing was.”"
"“我在想，”玛丽说，“你和迪肯多么不一样啊。”","“I was thinking,” said Mary, “how different you are from Dickon.”"
"“迪肯是谁？”他问，“这名字可真奇怪！”","“Who is Dickon?” he said.“What a queer name!”"
"她也可以告诉他，她想她可以只谈迪肯，不提秘密花园。她以前就爱听玛莎说起迪肯。另外，她很渴望谈起他。这样好像就离他更近了一些。","She might as well tell him, she thought she could talk about Dickon without mentioning the secret garden.She had liked to hear Martha talk about him.Besides, she longed to talk about him.It would seem to bring him nearer."
"“他是玛莎的弟弟。他十二岁。”她解释道，“他和世上其他人都不一样。他可以吸引来狐狸、松鼠和小鸟，就像印度土著能吸引蛇一样。他用笛子吹出非常轻柔的曲子，动物们都跑过来听。”","“He is Martha’s brother.He is twelve years old,” she explained.“He is not like any one else in the world.He can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the natives in India charm snakes.He plays a very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen.”"
"柯林那一侧的桌子上有些大书，他突然拖过来一本。“这本书里有张耍蛇人的图。”他大声说，“过来看看。”","There were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged one suddenly toward him.“There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,” he exclaimed.“Come and look at it.”"
"这书很漂亮，彩插制作也很精良。他翻到其中一幅图。","The book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and he turned to one of them."
"“他能做这个吗？”他急切地问。","“Can he do that?” he asked eagerly."
"“他就吹笛子，动物们就听着。”玛丽解释道，“但他不称之为魔法。他说那是因为自己生活在旷野上，时间长了，就了解了动物的方式。他说他有时候仿佛觉得自己就是一只鸟或是一只兔子，他太喜欢它们了。我觉得他问了知更鸟问题。他们好像用轻柔的喳喳声交谈。”","“He played on his pipe and they listened,” Mary explained.“But he doesn’t call it Magic.He says it’s because he lives on the moor so much and he knows their ways.He says he feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself, he likes them so.I think he asked the robin questions.It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.”"
"柯林向后靠在靠枕上，眼睛睁得越来越大，脸颊上的两团红色烧了起来。","Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger and the spots on his cheeks burned."
"“给我多讲些他的事情。”他说。","“Tell me some more about him,” he said."
"“他知道所有鸟蛋和鸟巢的事情。”玛丽继续，“他知道狐狸、獾、水獭住在哪里。他会保守秘密，这样别的男孩儿就找不到动物的穴，不会吓到它们了。他知道旷野上生长生活着的所有的东西。”","“He knows all about eggs and nests,” Mary went on.“And he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live.He keeps them secret so that other boys won’t find their holes and frighten them.He knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor.”"
"“他喜欢旷野吗？”柯林问，“那旷野那么广大，光秃秃阴沉沉的，他怎么会喜欢那种地方呢？”","“Does he like the moor?” said Colin.“How can he when it’s such a great, bare, dreary place?”"
"“旷野是世上最美丽的地方。”玛丽抗议道，“那里长着成千上百可爱的东西，有成千上百小生物忙着筑巢、挖洞、朝彼此叽叽喳喳叫着、唱歌。它们在地下、树上、石南丛里忙碌着，玩得非常开心。那是它们的世界。”","“It’s the most beautiful place,” protested Mary.“Thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other.They are so busy and having such fun under the earth or in the trees or heather.It’s their world.”"
"“你怎么知道这么多？”柯林用手肘撑着转身看着玛丽。","“How do you know all that?” said Colin, turning on his elbow to look at her."
"“事实上，我从未去过旷野。”玛丽突然记起了什么，“我只有在晚上坐车经过。当时我觉得旷野令人厌恶。最早是玛莎给我讲旷野，后来是迪肯。迪肯讲的时候，你就感觉好像自己看到了、听到了，好像自己站在石南丛中，阳光普照，金雀花闻起来像蜂蜜——到处都是蜜蜂和蝴蝶。”","“I have never been there once, really,” said Mary suddenly remembering.“I only drove over it in the dark.I thought it was hideous.Martha told me about it first and then Dickon.When Dickon talks about it you feel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey—and all full of bees and butterflies.”"
"“你要是生病，就什么也看不到。”柯林不安地说。他看起来像是一个人听到了从远处传来的陌生的声音，捉摸着那到底是什么。","“You never see anything if you are ill,” said Colin restlessly.He looked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was."
"“你呆在屋子里，就看不到。”玛丽说。","“You can’t if you stay in a room,” said Mary."
"“我没法去旷野上。”他沮丧地说。","“I couldn’t go on the moor,” he said in a resentful tone."
"玛丽沉默了一下，下一刻说了一句大胆的话。","Mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold."
"“你也许能——有一天。”","“You might—sometime.”"
"柯林动了动，像是被吓了一跳。","He moved as if he were startled."
"“去旷野上！我怎么可以？我就快要死了。”“你怎么知道？”玛丽毫无同情心地说道。她不喜欢他谈起死亡时的态度。她不怎么同情他。她觉得他反而像是拿这个当作炫耀。","“Go on the moor!How could I?I am going to die.”“How do you know?” said Mary unsympathetically.She didn’t like the way he had of talking about dying.She did not feel very sympathetic.She felt rather as if he almost boasted about it."
"“噢，从我记事起就一直听说。”他不开心地回答道，“他们总在窃窃私语，还以为我注意不到。他们也希望我死。”","“Oh, I’ve heard it ever since I remember,” he answered crossly.“They are always whispering about it and thinking I don’t notice.They wish I would, too.”"
"玛丽小姐觉得非常反感。她抿紧了嘴唇。","Mistress Mary felt quite contrary.She pinched her lips together."
"“如果他们希望我死，”她说，“我偏不死。谁希望你死呢？”","“If they wished I would,” she said, “I wouldn’t.Who wishes you would?”"
"“那些仆人——当然还有克雷文医生，因为那样的话他就能得到米瑟斯韦特庄园，不用受穷了。他不敢这么说，但我状况变差时，他总是看起来那么开心。那次我得风湿热的时候，他的脸变得很胖。我觉得我爸爸也这么希望。”","“The servants—and of course Dr. Craven because he would get Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor.He daren’t say so, but he always looks cheerful when I am worse.When I had typhoid fever his face got quite fat.I think my father wishes it, too.”"
"“我不相信他会希望你死。”玛丽非常固执地说。","“I don’t believe he does,” said Mary quite obstinately."
"这使得柯林再次转过来看她。","That made Colin turn and look at her again."
"“你不相信吗？”他说。","“Don’t you?” he said."
"然后他向后躺回靠枕上，一动不动，好像在思考。有好一阵子的沉默。也许他们两个都在思考小孩子通常不会思考的、奇怪的事情。“我喜欢那个伦敦来的大医生，因为他让他们摘掉那铁家伙。”玛丽终于说，“他说你快死了吗？”","And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he were thinking.And there was quite a long silence.Perhaps they were both of them thinking strange things children do not usually think.“I like the grand doctor from London, because he made them take the iron thing off,” said Mary at last .“Did he say you were going to die?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“他说了什么？”","“What did he say?”"
"“他没有小声嘀咕。”柯林回答道，“也许他知道我讨厌窃窃私语。我听到他非常大声地讲了一件事。他说：‘只要他想，这个小伙子就能活下来。要让他保持开心。’听起来好像他在生气。”","“He didn’t whisper,” Colin answered.“Perhaps he knew I hated whispering.I heard him say one thing quite aloud.He said, ‘The lad might live if he would make up his mind to it.Put him in the humor.’It sounded as if he was in a temper.”"
"“也许我能告诉你谁能让你开心。”玛丽若有所思地说着。她觉得自己似乎希望这件事得到解决，无论以何种方式。“我相信迪肯可以。他总是谈论有生命的东西。他从来不讲死掉的或者生病的东西。他总是抬头看天空，看飞过的小鸟——或者低头看大地，看一些生长着的东西。他眼睛那么圆那么蓝，总是大力睁开到处看。他笑起来嘴巴咧得那么宽——他的脸颊也那么红——红得像樱桃。”她把脚凳朝沙发拉近了些，一想起迪肯宽阔弯曲的嘴巴和睁得大大的眼睛，她表情都完全变了。","“I’ll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,” said Mary reflecting.She felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one way or the other.“I believe Dickon would.He’s always talking about live things.He never talks about dead things or things that are ill.He’s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying—or looking down at the earth to see something growing.He has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about.And he laughs such a big laugh with his wide mouth—and his cheeks are as red—as red as cherries.”She pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes."
"“看这里。”她说，“我们不要讲死，我不喜欢。让我们讲活着。我们来讲，讲讲迪肯。然后我们再看看你的画。”","“See here,” she said.“Don’t let us talk about dying; I don’t like it.Let us talk about living.Let us talk and talk about Dickon.And then we will look at your pictures.”"
"这是她能说过的最好的话了。谈论迪肯就意味着谈旷野、谈农舍、谈屋里住的那十四个用十六先令可以过一周的人——孩子们像野马驹一样，吃点旷野上的草就长肥。还有迪肯的妈妈——还有跳绳——还有阳光普照的旷野——还有黑色草皮上冒出的灰绿色的小点儿。一切都那么生机勃勃。玛丽一生都没讲过这么多话——柯林又听又说，这也是他从未做过的。他们两个也开始没来由大笑，就像小孩子在一起高兴时会做的那样。他们笑到最后那么吵闹，仿佛两人已变成正常、健康、自然的十岁的小孩儿——而并非一个是生硬、瘦小、没爱心的小女孩儿，另一个是病怏怏认为自己会死掉的小男孩儿。","It was the best thing she could have said.To talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week—and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies.And about Dickon’s mother—and the skipping-rope—and the moor with the sun on it—and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod.And it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she had ever talked before—and Colin both talked and listened as he had never done either before.And they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together.And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old creatures—instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die."
"他们玩得那么开心，甚至忘记了图画，忘记了时间。他们笑得那么大声，笑老本和他的知更鸟，柯林突然想起了什么，竟然坐了起来，似乎已经忘记了自己软弱的后背。“你知道吗，有一件事我们从未想起过。”他说，“我们是表兄妹。”","They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time.They had been laughing quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his robin, and Colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about his weak back, when he suddenly remembered something.“Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,” he said.“We are cousins.”"
"真奇怪，他们聊了这么多，却从没想起这么简单的事。他们笑得更加大声了，因为他们现在的情绪碰到什么事情都想笑。正在欢乐之中，门打开了，克雷文医生和梅德洛克太太走了进来。","It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered this simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had got into the humor to laugh at anything.And in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock."
"克雷文医生惊得跳了起来，梅德洛克太太差点儿朝后摔倒，因为克雷文医生恰巧撞到了她。","Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back because he had accidentally bumped against her."
"“我的天啊！”可怜的梅德洛克太太惊呼，眼睛几乎都要掉了出来，“我的老天爷！”","“Good Lord!” exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her eyes almost starting out of her head.“Good Lord!”"
"“这是什么？”克雷文医生说，朝前来，“这是什么意思？”","“What is this?” said Dr. Craven, coming forward.“What does it mean?”"
"玛丽又想起了那个印度小王爷。柯林回答道，仿佛医生的担心和梅德洛克太太的惊恐对他都毫无影响。仿佛进来的是一只年迈的猫和狗，他丝毫没有被影响或被吓到。","Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again.Colin answered as if neither the doctor’s alarm nor Mrs. Medlock’s terror were of the slightest consequence.He was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog had walked into the room."
"“这是我的表亲，玛丽·伦诺克斯。”他回答道，“我让她来和我聊天。我喜欢她。我什么时候派人去叫她，她就必须过来和我聊天。”","“This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,” he said.“I asked her to come and talk to me.I like her.She must come and talk to me whenever I send for her.”"
"克雷文医生责备地转向梅德洛克太太。“噢，先生，”她喘着气说，“我不知道这是怎么发生的。这地方没哪个仆人敢说——他们都被命令过。”","Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.“Oh, sir，” she panted.“I don’t know how it’s happened.There’s not a servant on the place tha’d dare to talk—they all have their orders.”"
"“没人告诉她任何事情。”柯林说，“她听到我哭自己找到我的。我很高兴她来了。别傻了，梅德洛克。”","“Nobody told her anything,” said Colin.“She heard me crying and found me herself.I am glad she came.Don’t be silly, Medlock.”"
"玛丽看到克雷文医生看起来不高兴，但很显然他不敢违抗他的病人。他坐在柯林身边给他把脉。","Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plain that he dare not oppose his patient.He sat down by Colin and felt his pulse."
"“恐怕你过于激动了。激动对你不好，我的孩子。”他说。","“I am afraid there has been too much excitement.Excitement is not good for you, my boy,” he said."
"“她要是不来，我就会激动。”柯林回答道，他的眼睛开始危险地眨啊眨，“我好些了。是她让我好些的。护士必须把她的茶和我的一起拿来。我们要一起喝茶。”","“I should be excited if she kept away,” answered Colin, his eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling.“I am better.She makes me better.The nurse must bring up her tea with mine.We will have tea together.”"
"梅德洛克太太和克雷文医生为难地对视，但显然他们也不能做什么。","Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, but there was evidently nothing to be done."
"“他看起来确实好了许多。”梅德洛克太太试探着，“但”——又想了想——“但今早她还没来之前，他就看起来好些了。”","“He does look rather better, sir,” ventured Mrs. Medlock.“But”—thinking the matter over—“he looked better this morning before she came into the room.”"
"“她昨晚就来过了。她陪我呆了很长时间。她给我唱印度语歌谣，哄我入睡。”柯林说，“我醒来时就好些了。我有胃口吃早饭。我现在想喝茶。告诉护士，梅德洛克。”","“She came into the room last night.She stayed with me a long time.She sang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,” said Colin.“I was better when I wakened up.I wanted my breakfast.I want my tea now.Tell nurse, Medlock.”"
"克雷文医生没有久留。护士进房的时候，他跟护士说了几分钟，对柯林警告了几句。一定不能说太多话，不能忘记自己有病，不能忘记自己很容易累。玛丽想，看起来他不能忘记的不愉快的事情还真不少。","Dr. Craven did not stay very long.He talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to Colin.He must not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill; he must not forget that he was very easily tired.Mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget."
"柯林看起来很烦躁，他奇怪的有着黑睫毛的眼睛盯着克雷文医生的脸。","Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr. Craven’s face."
"“我想忘记这些。”他终于说，“她使我忘记这些。这就是为什么我想要她。”","“I want to forget it,” he said at last.“She makes me forget it.That is why I want her.”"
"克雷文医生离开房间的时候看起来不高兴。他困惑地瞥了一眼这个坐在大脚凳上的小女孩儿。从克雷文医生一进房，玛丽就又变回一个僵硬、沉默的孩子，他看不出玛丽究竟哪里吸引人。然而，柯林确实看起来明朗了些——他沉重地叹了口气，沿着走廊走了下去。","Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room.He gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool.She had become a stiff, silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not see what the attraction was.The boy actually did look brighter, however—and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor."
"“我不想吃东西的时候他们总是想让我吃。”柯林说，护士把茶端进来放在沙发旁的桌子上，“现在，你吃我就吃。那些小松糕看起来热腾腾的真不错。给我讲讲小王爷的事情吧。”","“They are always wanting me to eat things when I don’t want to,” said Colin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the sofa.“Now, if you’ll eat I will.Those muffins look so nice and hot.Tell me about Rajahs.”"
"第十五章 筑巢","CHAPTER XV NEST BUILDING"
"下了一个礼拜的雨之后，高远的蓝色苍穹再次出现，洒下来的阳光热辣辣的。虽然既没机会看到秘密花园，也没机会见迪肯，但玛丽小姐还是自得其乐。这个礼拜并不显得漫长。她每天都要花上好几个小时呆在科林的房间里，和他聊印度王爷、花园、迪肯和原野上的农舍。他们一起看精彩的书和图画，有时玛丽会读书给柯林听，有时柯林读一点给玛丽听。每当柯林被逗乐，来了兴致的时候，玛丽会觉得，他除了脸上没血色，而且总在沙发上呆着之外，根本不像个病人。","After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot.Though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself very much.The week had not seemed long.She had spent hours of every day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor.They had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, and sometimes he had read a little to her.When he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa."
"“你真是个狡猾的小孩，那天晚上听到了声音，竟从床上起来去跟踪。”梅德洛克太太曾这样说。“但也不得不说，这是我们好多人的福音。自从你们交上朋友，他就再没发过一次脾气，没犯过一次病。护士曾经差点放弃这差事，因为她受不了他了，但现在她说，有你和她一起当班，她就不介意留下来了。”她浅笑着说。","“You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night,” Mrs. Medlock said once.“But there’s no saying it’s not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us.He’s not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends.The nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him, but she says she doesn’t mind staying now you’ve gone on duty with her,” laughing a little."
"和科林聊天时，一讲到秘密花园，玛丽就分外谨慎。她想从科林那里弄清楚一些事情，，但又觉得不能直接问他。玛丽开始喜欢和科林呆在一起了，她首先想弄清楚他是不是那种可以对之倾诉秘密的男孩。他和迪肯一点都不像，但那个不为人知的花园显然让他大为高兴，所以玛丽觉得他也许可以信任。但她认识他的时间还不够长，不足以肯定。她想弄清楚的第二件事就是：如果他可以信任——如果真的可以——难道不能神不知鬼不觉地把他带到花园里去吗？医师说过他需要新鲜空气，科林自己也说他不介意到秘密花园里去呼吸新鲜空气。如果他可以呼吸到大量新鲜空气，又认识了迪肯和知更鸟，还看到万物生长，那他也许就不会老想着死了。最近几次玛丽照镜子时，便意识到，自己看上去和当初那个刚从印度来的孩子已经判若两人了。眼前这个孩子看上去更好。连玛莎都发觉她变了。","In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden.There were certain things she wanted to find out from him, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions.In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to.He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted.But she had not known him long enough to be sure.The second thing she wanted to find out was this: If he could be trusted—if he really could—wouldn’t it be possible to take him to the garden without having any one find it out?The grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden.Perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not think so much about dying.Mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from India.This child looked nicer.Even Martha had seen a change in her."
"“原野上的新鲜空气已经对你起作用了。”她说，“你脸色没那么黄了，也不那么皮包骨头了。连你的头发都不再平平板板地贴在头上了。它们也有点生气了，能蓬起来一点。”","“Th’ air from th’ moor has done thee good already,” she had said.“Tha’rt not nigh so yeller and tha’rt not nigh so scrawny.Even tha’ hair doesn’t slamp down on tha’ head so flat.It’s got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit.”"
"“它像我一样，”玛丽说，“越长越强壮，越长越结实。我敢肯定以后还会更好。”","“It’s like me,” said Mary.“It’s growing stronger and fatter.I’m sure there’s more of it.”"
"“当然，看得出来。”玛莎边说边把玛丽脸庞两边的头发微微弄乱，“这样就好看多了，而且脸颊上还有点红润。”","“It looks it, for sure,” said Martha, ruffling it up a little round her face.“Tha’rt not half so ugly when it’s that way an’ there’s a bit o’ red in tha’ cheeks.”"
"如果花园和新鲜空气对自己有好处，那也许对科林也有好处。但是如果他不喜欢别人看着他，那他可能也不想见迪肯。","If gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would be good for Colin.But then, if he hated people to look at him, perhaps he would not like to see Dickon."
"“为什么别人看着你时你会生气呢？”有一天她问道。","“Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?” she inquired one day."
"“向来如此，”他回答说，“我从小就不喜欢这样。以前他们带我去海边，我总是躺在轮椅上，每个人都盯着我看，女士们会停下来和我的护士说话，然后他们就开始窃窃私语，我知道他们在说我肯定活不长。有时那些女士还会拍拍我的脸说‘可怜的孩子！’有一次一位女士那样做了，我就高声尖叫，还咬了她的手。她吓得跑开了。”","“I always hated it,” he answered, “even when I was very little.Then when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and then they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I shouldn’t live to grow up.Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say ‘Poor child!’Once when a lady did that I screamed out loud and bit her hand.She was so frightened she ran away.”"
"“她觉得你疯了，像条狗似的。”玛丽毫无赞许之意。","“She thought you had gone mad like a dog,” said Mary, not at all admiringly."
"“我才不在乎她怎么想呢。”科林皱着眉头说。","“I don’t care what she thought,” said Colin, frowning."
"“我想知道我进你房间的时候，为什么你没有尖叫也没有咬我呢？”玛丽问道。随后，她慢慢笑了。","“I wonder why you didn’t scream and bite me when I came into your room?” said Mary.Then she began to smile slowly."
"“我以为你是个鬼，或者是一个梦。”他说，“你不能咬一个鬼魂或者一个梦，而且你就是尖叫，他们也不在乎。”","“I thought you were a ghost or a dream,” he said.“You can’t bite a ghost or a dream, and if you scream they don’t care.”"
"”如果——如果一个男孩看着你，你会生气吗？” 玛丽犹豫着问道。","“Would you hate it if—if a boy looked at you?”Mary asked uncertainly."
"科林躺回靠枕上，若有所思地沉默了一会儿。","He lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully."
"“有一个男孩，”他语速很慢，好像在斟酌每一个词，“有一个男孩我觉得我不会介意。就是那个知道狐狸住在哪里的男孩——迪肯。”","“There’s one boy,” he said quite slowly, as if he were thinking over every word, “there’s one boy I believe I shouldn’t mind.It’s that boy who knows where the foxes live—Dickon.”"
"“我肯定你不会对他介意的。”玛丽说。","“I’m sure you wouldn’t mind him,” said Mary."
"“小鸟和其他动物不介意，”他仍是若有所思地说，“也许这就是为什么我也不会介意。他是个驯兽师，而我是个动物一样的男孩。”","“The birds don’t and other animals,” he said, still thinking it over, “perhaps that’s why I shouldn’t.He’s a sort of animal charmer and I am a boy animal.”"
"他说完便笑了，玛丽也笑了；最后两人都开怀大笑，觉得一个动物一样的男孩躲在自己洞里的想法非常有趣。","Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny indeed."
"随后，玛丽便觉得自己不用担心迪肯了。","What Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about Dickon."
"天空重现湛蓝的第一个清晨，玛丽很早就醒了。道道阳光透过百叶窗斜着倾洒进来，这景象让人倍感愉悦，玛丽跳下床，跑到窗边。她拉起百叶窗，打开窗子，一阵清新芬芳的空气扑面而来。原野一片碧色，整个天地宛如被施过魔法一般。柔和轻细的笛声在近处远方处处萦回，就好像许许多多的小鸟开始为音乐会奏乐。玛丽把手伸出窗外，伸进阳光里。","On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early.The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window.She drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her.The moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happened to it.There were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert.Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun."
"“是暖的——暖的！”她说，“阳光会让绿芽长高长高再长高，也会让根的球须在地下拼命努力、挣扎。”","“It’s warm—warm!” she said.“It will make the green points push up and up and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth.”"
"她跪下来，尽可能地将身体探出窗外，大口呼吸着新鲜空气，最后她笑了起来，因为她想起了迪肯的妈妈说过，迪肯的鼻尖会像兔子一样颤动。“现在一定很早，”她说，“小云朵都是粉红色的，以前我从来没见过这样的天空。大家都还没起床。我连马童们的声音都没听到。”","She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could, breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because she remembered what Dickon’s mother had said about the end of his nose quivering like a rabbit’s.“It must be very early,” she said.“The little clouds are all pink and I’ve never seen the sky look like this.No one is up.I don’t even hear the stable boys.”"
" 一个突如其来的念头促使她急忙站起来。","A sudden thought made her scramble to her feet."
" “我等不及了！ 我要去看花园！”","“I can’t wait!I am going to see the garden!”"
"现在她已经学会自己穿衣服了，五分钟之内便穿戴好了。她知道有个小边门，她自己就可打开边门的插销，于是她只穿着袜子飞身下楼，再在大厅里穿上鞋子。她解开锁链，拉开门栓，打开锁，门一开，她便一下跃过台阶，跳到草地上。草坪看起来已微微泛绿，阳光洒在她身上，和煦的微风带着馨香在她周围环绕，每一丛灌木，每一棵树间，都传来笛声、啁啾声和歌声。她纯因喜悦而扣紧了双手抬头仰望，蓝色、粉色、珍珠色和白色交织着，整个天空满溢着春日的光华。她觉得自己一定要吹笛，要放声歌唱，她知道画眉鸟、知更鸟和百灵鸟一定会情不自禁地唱起来。她在灌木中和小径上奔跑着，一直跑向秘密花园。","She had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothes in five minutes.She knew a small side door which she could unbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall.She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there she was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree.She clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it.She ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden."
"“一切已经完全不同了，”她说，“草更绿了，到处都有新生命冒出来，舒展开，绿色的叶芽也显现出来了。我肯定今天下午迪肯会来的。”","“It is all different already,” she said.“The grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing.This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.”"
"暖雨下久了，矮墙脚下小径边的香草苗床就发生了神奇的变化。那一丛丛植物的根部有新生命往外冒着、挤着，随处都可以瞥见星星点点的蓝紫色和黄色在番红花的茎叶间舒展开来。六个月前，玛丽小姐还从未见过万物复苏的样子，而现在，她什么都没错过。","The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall.There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses.Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen how the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing."
"当她来到常春藤遮掩下的门口时，一道奇特而响亮的声音吓了她一跳。那是一声鸣叫——乌鸦的鸣叫，来自墙头，玛丽抬头一看，墙头栖息着一只羽毛光滑的蓝黑色大鸟，正用睿智的目光俯视着她。她从没那么近距离地见过乌鸦，这让她有点紧张，不过它下一刻就展开翅膀，一路扑闪着飞过花园去了。玛丽希望那只乌鸦别留在花园里，她推开门，猜想着它在不在里面。她来到花园深处时，便看出那只乌鸦可能真的要留在花园里了，因为它停在了一棵矮苹果树上，树下躺着一只红兮兮的，尾巴毛茸茸的小动物，它和乌鸦都注视着迪肯俯下的身体和锈红色的脑袋，他正跪在草地上卖力地干活。","When she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy, she was startled by a curious loud sound.It was the caw—caw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely indeed.She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the garden.She hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would.When she got fairly into the garden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a little reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the grass working hard."
"玛丽穿过草地飞奔到他身边。","Mary flew across the grass to him."
"“噢，迪肯！迪肯！”她叫道，你怎么可以这么早就来了呢！怎么做到的呢！太阳才刚刚起来！”","“Oh, Dickon!Dickon!” she cried out.“How could you get here so early!How could you!The sun has only just got up!”"
"他笑着站起来，容光焕发，然后又挠了挠头；他的眼睛就像天空的一角。","He got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his eyes like a bit of the sky."
"“啊！”他说，“我比太阳起得早多了。在床上怎么呆得住！今天早晨这个世界又重新开工了，真的。有干活儿的，哼曲子的，刨地的，安管道的，筑巢的，还有散发香气的，直到你起床出门，不再朝天躺着。太阳跳出来的时候，整个原野高兴坏了，我正在石南丛里，自己也疯跑起来，喊啊唱啊。然后我就径直跑到这里来啦。我不能不来。嗯，花园正在这儿等着我呢！”","“Eh!” he said.“I was up long before him.How could I have stayed abed!Th’ world’s all fair begun again this mornin’, it has.An’ it’s workin’ an’ hummin’ an’ scratchin’ an’ pipin’ an’ nest-buildin’ an’ breathin’ out scents, till you’ve got to be out on it ‘stead o’ lyin’ on your back.When th’ sun did jump up, th’ moor went mad for joy, an’ I was in the midst of th’ heather, an’ I run like mad myself, shoutin’ an’ singin’.An’ I come straight here.I couldn’t have stayed away.Why, th’ garden was lyin’ here waitin’!”"
"玛丽把手放在胸口，喘着气，好像自己也刚刚跑过。","Mary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she had been running herself."
"“噢，迪肯！迪肯！”她叫道，“我高兴得喘不过气来了！”","“Oh, Dickon!Dickon!” she said.“I’m so happy I can scarcely breathe!”"
"看到迪肯在和一个陌生人说话，那尾巴毛茸茸的小动物便从树下站起来走向他，那只白嘴鸦则又叫了一声，从树枝上飞下来，静静地落在他肩上。","Seeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rose from its place under the tree and came to him, and the rook, cawing once, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder."
"“这是只狐狸崽儿，”他揉着那红兮兮的小动物的脑袋说道，“它叫船长。这是煤烟。煤烟跟着我飞过原野，船长跑起来就像后头有猎狗在追它似的。他们和我的感受是一样的。”","“This is th’ little fox cub,” he said, rubbing the little reddish animal’s head.“It’s named Captain.An’ this here’s Soot.Soot he flew across th’ moor with me an’ Captain he run same as if th’ hounds had been after him.They both felt same as I did.”"
" 两个小家伙都似乎一点也不怕玛丽。 迪肯开始四处走动时，煤烟就停在他肩上，船长则静静地跟在他身旁小跑。","Neither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of Mary.When Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his shoulder and Captain trotted quietly close to his side."
"“看这儿！”迪肯叫道，“这儿已经冒出来了，还有这儿，这儿！啊！看这里！”","“See here!” said Dickon.“See how these has pushed up, an’ these an’ these!An’ Eh! Look at here!”"
"他跪下来，玛丽在他身旁蹲下。他们看到了一整丛的番红花冒出了紫色、橙色和金色。玛丽俯下脸，对它们吻了又吻。","He threw himself upon his knees and Mary went down beside him.They had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold.Mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them."
"“你从来不会那样去亲一个人，”她抬起头来说，“花是不一样的。”","“You never kiss a person in that way,” she said when she lifted her head.“Flowers are so different.”"
"迪肯显得很困惑，但还是笑了。","He looked puzzled but smiled."
"“啊！”他说，“好几次我在原野上闲逛了一整天回来，就是那样亲我妈妈的，她就站在门口的太阳光下，看起来很高兴很舒心。”他们从花园的一处跑到另一处，发现了好多奇妙的东西，他们不得不提醒自己要轻轻地、小声地说话。迪肯指给玛丽看玫瑰枝上鼓鼓的叶芽，那花枝以前看上去像死了一般。他还指给她看千万点破土而出的新绿。他们急切地将属于年轻人的鼻子凑近土地，嗅着那温暖的春日气息；他们欢天喜地地挖着，拔着，轻声笑着，直到玛丽小姐的头发变得和迪肯一样乱，双颊变成和迪肯一样的罂粟红。","“Eh!” he said, “I’ve kissed mother many a time that way when I come in from th’ moor after a day’s roamin’ an’ she stood there at th’ door in th’ sun, lookin’ so glad an’ comfortable.”They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low.He showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead.He showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould.They put their eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary’s hair was as tumbled as Dickon’s and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his."
"那天早晨的秘密花园蕴含了世上所有的欢欣，在这些欢欣之中，有一种快乐无与伦比，因为它更加奇妙。有东西轻捷地掠过墙头，穿过树丛，直冲向一个枝叶四合的角落，那是一只红胸脯的小鸟，一闪而过，嘴上还挂着什么东西。迪肯一动不动地站着，手放在玛丽身上，他们好像突然惊觉自己在教堂里大笑似的。","There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it was more wonderful.Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of red-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak.Dickon stood quite still and put his hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church."
"“我们角对不能动，”迪肯用很重约克郡口音轻声说，“角对不能大声喘气。 上回见到它的时候，我就知道它在找对象。 那是本•韦瑟斯塔夫的知更鸟。它正在为自己做窝呢。要是我们不和它起冲突，它就会留在这里。”他们轻轻地在草地上坐下来，动也不动。","“We munnot stir,” he whispered in broad Yorkshire.“We munnot scarce breathe.I knowed he was mate-huntin’ when I seed him last.It’s Ben Weatherstaff’s robin.He’s buildin’ his nest.He’ll stay here if us don’t fight him.”They settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving."
"我们角不能显出自己是在密切注视它，”迪肯说，“如果它觉得我们妨碍了它，那它和我们的关系就永远好不了。到这一切结束之前，它都会有些反常。它正在打理它的家。它会更加害羞，而且更容易往坏处想。它没有时间串门、说长道短。我们得呆着别动，尽量装成草啊树啊或者灌木。它看我们看习惯了之后，我会啾啾叫几声，它就知道我们不会妨碍它了。”","“Us mustn’t seem as if us was watchin’ him too close,” said Dickon.“He’d be out with us for good if he got th’ notion us was interferin’ now.He’ll be a good bit different till all this is over.He’s settin’ up housekeepin’.He’ll be shyer an’ readier to take things ill.He’s got no time for visitin’ an’ gossipin’.Us must keep still a bit an’ try to look as if us was grass an’ trees an’ bushes.Then when he’s got used to seein’ us I’ll chirp a bit an’ he’ll know us’ll not be in his way.”"
"玛丽小姐不太确定自己是不是像迪肯一样熟知怎么装成草啊树啊还有灌木。但这古怪的事情被他说得就好像是世上再简单再自然不过的事儿，所以她觉得迪肯对此一定驾轻就熟，于是她真的仔细观察了他几分钟，好奇地想他究竟是不是可以静静地变成绿色，长出枝叶。可他只是一动不动地坐着，说话的声音也变得那样轻柔，要能听见就是奇迹，但是，她竟真能听见。","Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to, how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes.But he had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she watched him for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves.But he only sat wonderfully still, and when he spoke dropped his voice to such a softness that it was curious that she could hear him, but she could."
"“这也是春天的一部分，我是说做窝这事儿，”他说， “我保证，自打这世界出现，每年都一样进行。 它们有它们自己的思考、做事方式，人最好别去掺和。在春天，要是你太好奇，你就可能比其他季节更容易失去朋友。”","“It’s part o’ th’ springtime, this nest-buildin’ is,” he said.“I warrant it’s been goin’ on in th’ same way every year since th’ world was begun.They’ve got their way o’ thinkin’ and doin’ things an’ a body had better not meddle.You can lose a friend in springtime easier than any other season if you’re too curious.”"
"“要是我们正讲到它，我就忍不住要看它。”玛丽尽量放低了声音说，“我们得讲点别的。 我想告诉你一件事。”","“If we talk about him I can’t help looking at him,” Mary said as softly as possible.“We must talk of something else.There is something I want to tell you.”"
"“它也更希望我们谈些别的，”迪肯说，“你要告诉我什么？”","“He’ll like it better if us talks o’ somethin’ else,” said Dickon.“What is it tha’s got to tell me?”"
"“嗯——你知道科林吗？”她小声问。","“Well—do you know about Colin?” she whispered."
"他扭头看着她。","He turned his head to look at her."
"“你知道关于他的什么事呢？”他问。","“What does tha’ know about him?” he asked."
"“我见到过他了。这个礼拜我天天都和他聊天。他希望我过去。他说我让他忘记了生病和死亡。”玛丽回答说。","“I’ve seen him.I have been to talk to him every day this week.He wants me to come.He says I’m making him forget about being ill and dying,” answered Mary."
"惊奇的神色从迪肯的圆脸上消失，他立刻显现出了轻松之态。","Dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from his round face."
"“这让我很高兴，”他叫道，“我高兴极了。 这让我轻松多了。 原来我只知道不能说起关于他的一点一滴，而我是不喜欢藏着掖着的。”","“I am glad o’ that,” he exclaimed.“I’m right down glad.It makes me easier.I knowed I must say nothin’ about him an’ I don’t like havin’ to hide things.”"
"“那你不想为花园保密吗？”玛丽问。","“Don’t you like hiding the garden?” said Mary."
"“我永远不会说出去的，”他回答，“但我对我妈妈说，‘妈妈，’我说，‘我有个秘密要保守。不是坏事，嗯，你知道的。这并不比隐瞒鸟巢的位置严重。你不介意的，对吧？’”","“I’ll never tell about it,” he answered.“But I says to mother, ‘Mother,’ I says, ‘I got a secret to keep.It’s not a bad ‘un, tha’ knows that.It’s no worse than hidin’ where a bird’s nest is.Tha’ doesn’t mind it, does tha’?’”"
"玛丽总是很想听到关于他妈妈的事。","Mary always wanted to hear about mother."
"“她怎么说呢？”她问道，而且毫不害怕地听到答案。","“What did she say?” she asked, not at all afraid to hear."
"迪肯和善地笑了。","Dickon grinned sweet-temperedly."
"“就像她一贯会说的那样，”他回答，“她揉了揉我的脑袋，然后笑着说，‘啊，孩子，你可以保守所有你想保守的秘密。我认识你十二年了了。’”","“It was just like her, what she said,” he answered.“She give my head a bit of a rub an’ laughed an’ she says, ‘Eh, lad, tha’ can have all th’ secrets tha’ likes.I’ve knowed thee twelve year’.’”"
"“你是怎么知道科林的？”玛丽问。","“How did you know about Colin?” asked Mary."
"“认识克雷文老爷的人都知道他有个儿子，以后可能会变成瘸子，大家也都知道克雷文老爷不喜欢别人议论他儿子。大家都为克雷文老爷可惜，因为克雷文太太那么年轻漂亮，而他们又那么相爱。梅德洛克太太每次去斯威特的时候都会来我们的小屋歇脚，她会当着我们孩子的面和妈妈交谈，毫不介意，因为她知道我们都是有教养的，信得过的。你是怎么发现科林的？上次马莎回来的时候都烦死了。她说你会听到他发脾气，还问一些她回答不上来的问题。”","“Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple, an’ they knowed Mester Craven didn’t like him to be talked about.Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs. Craven was such a pretty young lady an’ they was so fond of each other.Mrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an’ she doesn’t mind talkin’ to mother before us children, because she knows us has been brought up to be trusty.How did tha’ find out about him?Martha was in fine trouble th’ last time she came home.She said tha’d heard him frettin’ an’ tha’ was askin’ questions an’ she didn’t know what to say.”"
"玛丽就给迪肯讲了那个午夜她是怎样被呼啸的寒风吵醒，然后又是怎样被远处模糊的怨声引着，端起蜡烛沿着黑暗的走廊一路走去，最后又是怎样推开一扇房门，房里灯光昏暗，角落里有张雕花的四柱床。她讲到那张象牙色小脸和奇特的黑眼睛时，迪肯摇了摇头。","Mary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind which had wakened her and about the faint far-off sounds of the complaining voice which had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and had ended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with the carven four-posted bed in the corner.When she described the small ivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his head."
"“据说他的眼睛就像他妈妈的一样，只不过他妈妈的眼睛总是有笑意的。”他说，“听说他醒着的时候，克雷文先生就没法看着他，就是因为他的眼睛和他妈妈太像了，但同时又大不一样，因为他的脸看上去太悲伤了。”","“Them’s just like his mother’s eyes, only hers was always laughin’, they say,” he said.“They say as Mr. Craven can’t bear to see him when he’s awake an’ it’s because his eyes is so like his mother’s an’ yet looks so different in his miserable bit of a face.”"
"“你觉得他想死去吗？”玛丽轻声问。","“Do you think he wants to die?” whispered Mary."
"“不，但他宁愿自己从未出生。妈妈说，对于一个孩子，这是世界上最糟糕的事。没人要的小孩很少能健康成长。只要是钱能买到的，克雷文先生都会买给这个可怜的孩子，但他又希望忘记他的存在。因为他怕有一天他见到科林的时候，就发现他已经驼背了。”","“No, but he wishes he’d never been born.Mother she says that’s th’ worst thing on earth for a child.Them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives.Mester Craven he’d buy anythin’ as money could buy for th’ poor lad but he’d like to forget as he’s on earth.For one thing, he’s afraid he’ll look at him some day and find he’s growed hunchback.”"
"“科林自己也很怕这个，他都不愿意坐起来。”玛丽说，“他说他总是在想，如果他感觉有个瘤子冒出来，他就会发疯，活活尖叫死。”","“Colin’s so afraid of it himself that he won’t sit up,” said Mary.“He says he’s always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he should go crazy and scream himself to death.”"
"“哎！他不该躺在那里想这些，”迪肯说，“要是总想着这些，谁也好不了。”","“Eh! he oughtn’t to lie there thinkin’ things like that,” said Dickon.“No lad could get well as thought them sort o’ things.”"
"狐狸躺在他身旁的草地上，时不时抬头要他抚摸一下。迪肯弯下腰，轻轻地摩挲着它的脖子，安静地思索了几分钟。一会儿他又抬头环顾花园。","The fox was lying on the grass close by him, looking up to ask for a pat now and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly and thought a few minutes in silence.Presently he lifted his head and looked round the garden."
"“我们第一次进花园来的时候，”他说，“好像一切都是灰色的。但现在看看这周围，可别告诉我你没瞧出什么不同来。”","“When first we got in here,” he said, “it seemed like everything was gray.Look round now and tell me if tha’ doesn’t see a difference.”"
"玛丽看了看，微微屏住了呼吸。","Mary looked and caught her breath a little."
"“啊！”她叫道，“灰色的墙在变。就好像一层绿色的雾气正爬上墙。简直就像绿色面纱似的。”","“Why!” she cried, “the gray wall is changing.It is as if a green mist were creeping over it.It’s almost like a green gauze veil.”"
"“对啊，”迪肯说，“它会越变越绿，直到灰色全部消失。你能猜到我在想什么吗？”","“Aye,” said Dickon.“An’ it’ll be greener and greener till th’ gray’s all gone.Can tha’ guess what I was thinkin’?”"
"“我知道你在想好事情，”玛丽热切地说，“我觉得是关于科林的。”","“I know it was something nice,” said Mary eagerly.“I believe it was something about Colin.”"
"“我在想，如果他出门来到了这儿，他就不会总留意着背上是不是长了个瘤子；他会留意着玫瑰丛里的花苞开花，他很有可能会变得健壮些，”迪肯解释说，“我想我们能不能让他有心情到这儿来，让他躺在轮椅里，呆在树下。”　　“我自己也一直这么想。每次和他聊天我都有这样的想法，”玛丽说，“但我在想他是不是能保守秘密，我们能不能带他进来又不让任何人看见。我想，也许你可以为他推轮椅。医生说，他得呼吸新鲜空气，而且，要是他希望我们带他出去，没人敢违背他。他不愿意和其他人一起出去，而其他人也许正乐意我们带他出去。他可以命令花匠们离远点儿，那样他们就不会发现了。”","“I was thinkin’ that if he was out here he wouldn’t be watchin’ for lumps to grow on his back; he’d be watchin’ for buds to break on th’ rose-bushes, an’ he’d likely be healthier,” explained Dickon.“I was wonderin’ if us could ever get him in th’ humor to come out here an’ lie under th’ trees in his carriage.”“I’ve been wondering that myself.I’ve thought of it almost every time I’ve talked to him,” said Mary.“I’ve wondered if he could keep a secret and I’ve wondered if we could bring him here without any one seeing us.I thought perhaps you could push his carriage.The doctor said he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one dare disobey him.He won’t go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us.He could order the gardeners to keep away so they wouldn’t find out.”"
"迪肯一边挠船长的背一边努力思索着。","Dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain’s back."
"“这对他有好处，我保证，”他说，“我们不会觉得他没生出来更好。我们只是两个孩子，看着花园发生变化，而他会成为下一个。两个男孩和一个女孩一起欣赏春景。我保证这比医生的玩意儿强多了。”","“It’d be good for him, I’ll warrant,” he said.“Us’d not be thinkin’ he’d better never been born.Us’d be just two children watchin’ a garden grow, an’ he’d be another.Two lads an’ a little lass just lookin’ on at th’ springtime.I warrant it’d be better than doctor’s stuff.”"
"“他在屋里躺太久了，而且总是在为自己背担惊受怕，都变得怪里怪气的了，”玛丽说，“他知道很多书里看来的东西，但别的就什么都不懂了。他说他病得太厉害，没精力去留意别的事，他不喜欢到户外去，也讨厌花园和花匠。但他喜欢听花园的事，因为这是个秘密。我不敢多跟他讲，但他说他想看看花园。”","“He’s been lying in his room so long and he’s always been so afraid of his back that it has made him queer,” said Mary.“He knows a good many things out of books but he doesn’t know anything else.He says he has been too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hates gardens and gardeners.But he likes to hear about this garden because it is a secret.I daren’t tell him much but he said he wanted to see it.”"
"“我们一定要找时间让他来这儿的，”迪肯说，“我完全可以推得动他的轮椅。我们坐在这里的时候，你注意到知更鸟和它的伴儿是怎么干活儿的了吗？你看，它停在树枝上，正在考虑把嘴里的枝条放到哪里最好。”","“Us’ll have him out here sometime for sure,” said Dickon.“I could push his carriage well enough.Has tha’ noticed how th’ robin an’ his mate has been workin’ while we’ve been sittin’ here?Look at him perched on that branch wonderin’ where it’d be best to put that twig he’s got in his beak.”"
"他低低地吹了一声口哨，知更鸟扭头诧异地看着他，嘴里仍衔着枝条。迪肯像本•韦瑟斯塔夫一样和它说话，但是，迪肯用的是友好建议的语气。","He made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head and looked at him inquiringly, still holding his twig.Dickon spoke to him as Ben Weatherstaff did, but Dickon’s tone was one of friendly advice."
"“不管你放在哪里，”他说，“都没问题。你天生就知道应该怎么做鸟巢。继续干吧，伙计。没有时间可以浪费了。”","“Wheres’ever tha’ puts it,” he said, “it’ll be all right.Tha’ knew how to build tha’ nest before tha’ came out o’ th’ egg.Get on with thee, lad.Tha’st got no time to lose.”"
"“噢，我喜欢听你和它讲话！”玛丽说着，便开心地笑了，“本•韦瑟斯塔夫会骂它，取笑它，它蹦来蹦去，好像每个词都听得懂，我知道它喜欢你说的话。本•韦瑟斯塔夫说它自负得很，宁愿别人朝它扔石头，也不愿被忽视。”","“Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!”Mary said, laughing delightedly.“Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him, and he hops about and looks as if he understood every word, and I know he likes it.Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stones thrown at him than not be noticed.”"
"迪肯也笑了，又接着和它讲话。　","Dickon laughed too and went on talking."
"“你知道我们不会妨碍你的，”他对知更鸟说，“我们自己也接近野生动物了。我们也在搭窝呢，上帝保佑你。你可留神别去打我们的小报告啊。”","“Tha’ knows us won’t trouble thee,” he said to the robin.“Us is near bein’ wild things ourselves.Us is nest-buildin’ too, bless thee.Look out tha’ doesn’t tell on us.”"
"虽然知更鸟没有回答，因为它的嘴被占用了，但玛丽知道，当它衔着枝条飞向花园里它自己的角落时，它那黝黑清亮的眼睛便能说明它不会将他们的秘密公之于众。","And though the robin did not answer, because his beak was occupied, Mary knew that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of the garden the darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not tell their secret for the world."
"第十六章 “我偏不！” 玛丽说","CHAPTER XVI “I WON’T!” SAID MARY"
"那天早上他们发现有很多事情可干，所以玛丽回屋晚了，又赶着回去干活儿，便把科林忘在了脑后，直到最后一刻才记起。","They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late in returning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her work that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment."
"“告诉科林没，我现在还没空去见他，”她对玛莎说，“我在花园里忙得很。”","“Tell Colin that I can’t come and see him yet,” she said to Martha.“I’m very busy in the garden.”"
"玛莎看上去很害怕。","Martha looked rather frightened."
"“啊！玛丽小姐，”她说，“我要是这么告诉他，他会生气的。”","“Eh! Miss Mary,” she said, “it may put him all out of humor when I tell him that.”"
"但玛丽不像别人那么害怕科林，而且，她也不是个愿意牺牲自我的人。","But Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not a self-sacrificing person."
"“我不能再呆在这儿了，”她回答说，“迪肯在等我。”她跑开了。","“I can’t stay,” she answered.“Dickon’s waiting for me;” and she ran away."
"下午比上午更可爱，也更忙碌。花园里差不多所有的杂草都清除干净了，多数玫瑰和树木也修剪过了，松过土了。迪肯带来了自己的铁锹，他也教过玛丽怎么使用她自己的工具，所以，很明显，现在这可爱的野地大概是不会成为一个“花匠式的花园”了，而是会成一个草木争荣，野趣烂漫之所，直到春天结束。","The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been.Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about.Dickon had brought a spade of his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so that by this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a “gardener’s garden” it would be a wilderness of growing things before the springtime was over."
"“我们头顶上会有苹果花和樱桃花，”迪肯一边卖力地干活一边说，“墙边会有桃树和李树，也会开花，草地会变成满是鲜花的地毯。”","“There’ll be apple blossoms an’ cherry blossoms overhead,” Dickon said, working away with all his might.“An’ there’ll be peach an’ plum trees in bloom against th’ walls, an’ th’ grass’ll be a carpet o’ flowers.”"
"小狐狸和白嘴鸦和他们一样忙，知更鸟和它的伴儿像一道道小闪电一样飞来飞去。有时，白嘴鸦会扑扇着翅膀飞向园子里的树梢。每次它又会飞回来，停在迪肯的身旁叫几声，好像在讲述自己的冒险经历，迪肯会和它讲话，就像和知更鸟讲话一样。有一次迪肯太忙了，一开始顾不上回答它，煤烟便飞上他的肩头，轻轻地用大嘴拉他的耳朵。玛丽想休息的时候，迪肯就和她一起坐在树下。他从口袋里取出笛子，吹出柔和奇特的音符，墙头上便出现了两只松鼠，看着听着。","The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and the robin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning.Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the tree-tops in the park.Each time he came back and perched near Dickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures, and Dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin.Once when Dickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew on to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak.When Mary wanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a tree and once he took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened."
"“你比以前健壮了很多，”迪肯一边看玛丽挖地一边说， “你开始显得不一样了了，我敢肯定。”","“Tha’s a good bit stronger than tha’ was,” Dickon said, looking at her as she was digging.“Tha’s beginning to look different, for sure.”"
"由于运动之后精神很好，玛丽显得容光焕发。","Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits."
"“我每天都在长胖，”她兴高采烈地说，“梅德洛克太太得给我准备更大的衣服了。玛莎说我的头发也变厚了，不那么平板细碎了。”","“I’m getting fatter and fatter every day,” she said quite exultantly.“Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses.Martha says my hair is growing thicker.It isn’t so flat and stringy.”"
" 他们分手时，太阳正要落山，在树下斜射出一道道深金色的光。","The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays slanting under the trees when they parted."
"“明天会是好天气，”迪肯说，“太阳一出来我就来干活。”","“It’ll be fine tomorrow,” said Dickon.“I’ll be at work by sunrise.”"
"“我也是。”玛丽说。","“So will I,” said Mary."
"她以最快的速度跑回屋里。她要对科林讲迪肯的狐狸幼崽和乌鸦，要告诉他春天是什么样的。她确定他会喜欢听的。因此，当她打开自己的房门，却看到玛莎沉着脸站在那里等她时，她就不怎么愉快了。","She ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her.She wanted to tell Colin about Dickon’s fox cub and the rook and about what the springtime had been doing.She felt sure he would like to hear.So it was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room, to see Martha standing waiting for her with a doleful face."
"“怎么了？”她问，“你告诉科林我不能去，他怎么说？”","“What is the matter?” she asked.“What did Colin say when you told him I couldn’t come?”"
"“唉！”玛莎说，“我多希望你能去啊。他差点儿大发雷霆。整个下午，为了让他安静下来，我们可忙坏了。他一直都在看表。”","“Eh!” said Martha, “I wish tha’d gone.He was nigh goin’ into one o’ his tantrums.There’s been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet.He would watch the clock all th’ time.”"
" 玛丽抿着嘴唇。在体谅别人方面，她并不比科林强，而且她也不觉得一个坏脾气的男孩有什么理由去插手她最喜欢的事情。她完全不知道一个生着病、紧张不安的人有多可怜，他们不晓得要控制一下自己的脾气，不必弄得别人也不舒服，也紧张不安。在印度，她头疼的时候，便竭尽所能让别人也头疼，或陷入同样糟糕的境地。那时她觉得自己做得很对；但现在，她却理所当然地觉得科林是错的。","Mary’s lips pinched themselves together.She was no more used to considering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why an ill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best.She knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other people ill and nervous, too.When she had had a headache in India she had done her best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad.And she felt she was quite right; but of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong."
"她走进科林的房间时，他不在沙发上。他直挺挺地仰躺在床上，玛丽进来了，他也没有把脸转向她。 这个开头并不好，而玛丽还带着那股生硬的气势朝他走去。","He was not on his sofa when she went into his room.He was lying flat on his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in.This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiff manner."
"“你怎么不起来？”她问。","“Why didn’t you get up?” she said."
"“今天早上我本来起来了，我以为你会来。”他看也不看她就回答道，“今天下午我让人把我放回床上去了。我的背很痛，头也痛，我累了。你为什么没有来？”“我和迪肯在花园里干活儿。”玛丽说。","“I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,” he answered, without looking at her.“I made them put me back in bed this afternoon.My back ached and my head ached and I was tired.Why didn’t you come?”“I was working in the garden with Dickon,” said Mary."
"科林皱起了眉头，屈尊望向玛丽。","Colin frowned and condescended to look at her."
"“如果你和那个男孩呆在一起而不来陪我说话，我就不让他来这儿了。”他说。","“I won’t let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of coming to talk to me,” he said."
" 玛丽顿时大为光火。她一声不吭，火气也能蹿上来。 她只是变得刻薄又固执，不顾后果。","Mary flew into a fine passion.She could fly into a passion without making a noise.She just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened."
"“如果你赶走迪肯，我就再也不进这房间！”她还击道。","“If you send Dickon away, I’ll never come into this room again!” she retorted."
"“如果我要你来，你就必须来。”科林说。","“You’ll have to if I want you,” said Colin."
" “我偏不！”玛丽叫道。","“I won’t!” said Mary."
"“我会让你来的，”科林说， “他们拖也会把你拖进来。”","“I’ll make you,” said Colin.“They shall drag you in.”"
"“他们会吗，王爷先生！”玛丽气愤地说，“他们可以把我拖进来，但拖进来之后，他们也没法让我讲话。我就坐在这里，咬着牙，一个字也不告诉你。 我连看都不会看你一眼。我就盯着地板！”","“Shall they, Mr. Rajah!” said Mary fiercely.“They may drag me in but they can’t make me talk when they get me here.I’ll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing.I won’t even look at you.I’ll stare at the floor!”"
"他们俩怒目相向的时候倒是很登对儿。如果他们是街上的两个小子，恐怕早就已经扑向对方，扭打在一块儿了。但碍于现状，他们只好退而求其次。","They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other.If they had been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a rough-and-tumble fight.As it was, they did the next thing to it."
"“你这自私的家伙！”科林叫道。","“You are a selfish thing!” cried Colin."
"“那你算什么？”玛丽说，“自私的人总是说那种话。 谁没顺他们的意谁就自私了。 你比我更自私。 你是我见过的最自私的男孩。”","“What are you?” said Mary.“Selfish people always say that.Any one is selfish who doesn’t do what they want.You’re more selfish than I am.You’re the most selfish boy I ever saw.”"
"“我不是！”科林反驳道，“我可没有你的好迪肯自私！他明知道我是孤零零一个人，却还要拉着你在泥地上玩。他就是自私，随你怎么想！”","“I’m not!” snapped Colin.“I’m not as selfish as your fine Dickon is!He keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows I am all by myself.He’s selfish, if you like!”"
"玛丽的眼睛都冒出了火光。","Mary’s eyes flashed fire."
"“他比世上任何男孩都好！”她说，“他就像——他就像个天使！”这么说听起来也许有点傻，但她不在乎。","“He’s nicer than any other boy that ever lived!” she said.“He’s—he’s like an angel!”It might sound rather silly to say that but she did not care."
"“好一个天使！”科林狠狠地嘲讽道，“他只野地里一个粗俗的农家小子！”","“A nice angel!”Colin sneered ferociously.“He’s a common cottage boy off the moor!”"
"“总比一个粗俗的王爷好！”玛丽反驳道，“好上几千倍！”","“He’s better than a common Rajah!” retorted Mary.“He’s a thousand times better!”"
"两个人中，玛丽更强壮，所以她渐渐占了上风。事实上，科林这辈子从没同一个与自己一样的人吵过架，总的来说，这次吵架对他大有好处，虽然他和玛丽都全然不知。他枕着枕头扭过脸去，闭上双眼，一颗大大的泪滴被挤了出来，顺着脸颊流下来。他开始为自己感到悲伤、难过——而不是为别人。","Because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get the better of him.The truth was that he had never had a fight with any one like himself in his life and, upon the whole, it was rather good for him, though neither he nor Mary knew anything about that.He turned his head on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek.He was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himself—not for any one else."
"“我没你那么自私，因为我一直在生病，我敢肯定我背上有个瘤子在长，”他说，“我会死的。”","“I’m not as selfish as you, because I’m always ill, and I’m sure there is a lump coming on my back,” he said.“And I am going to die besides.”"
"“才不会呢！”玛丽毫不同情地驳斥。","“You’re not!” contradicted Mary unsympathetically."
" 科林因为愤怒而瞪大了眼睛。之前他从没听过这样的话。他立刻火冒三丈，但又隐隐感到一丝喜悦，如果一个人真能同时兼有二者的话。","He opened his eyes quite wide with indignation.He had never heard such a thing said before.He was at once furious and slightly pleased, if a person could be both at one time."
"“不会？”他叫道， “会的！ 你知道我会！ 每个人都这么说。”","“I’m not?” he cried.“I am!You know I am!Everybody says so.”"
"“我不相信！”玛丽针锋相对，“你那样说只是为了博得同情。我觉得你还引以为荣。我可不信！如果你是个好孩子，那也许就是真的——但你太招人讨厌了！”","“I don’t believe it!” said Mary sourly.“You just say that to make people sorry.I believe you’re proud of it.I don’t believe it!If you were a nice boy it might be true—but you’re too nasty!”"
"尽管后背有病，科林在盛怒之下从床上坐了起来。","In spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy rage."
"“滚出这房间！”他大叫着，抓起枕头掷向玛丽。他不够强壮，扔不远，枕头落在了玛丽脚下，但玛丽的脸拧得像个胡桃夹子。","“Get out of the room!” he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow and threw it at her.He was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her feet, but Mary’s face looked as pinched as a nutcracker."
"“我这就走，”她说，“再也不回来了！”她向门外走去，走到门口，又转过身，开口说话。","“I’m going,” she said.“And I won’t come back!”She walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round and spoke again."
"“我本打算把各种各样好玩的事都讲给你听，”她说，“迪肯带来了他的狐狸和乌鸦，我本打算全都告诉你的。现在，我什么都不会讲了！”","“I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,” she said.“Dickon brought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all about them.Now I won’t tell you a single thing!”"
"她大步走出房间，关上门，随即大吃一惊，她看到那个专业护士正站在那里，好像她一直在偷听，更让人吃惊的是——她还在笑。她是个大个子的年轻漂亮的女人，根本不该当专业护士，因为她受不了病人，她总是在找借口把科林扔给玛莎或者随便哪个能代替她的人。玛丽一直都不喜欢她，只是站在那儿盯着那个护士看，那护士则用手帕捂着嘴咯咯地笑。","She marched out of the door and closed it behind her, and there to her great astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she had been listening and, more amazing still—she was laughing.She was a big handsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all, as she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses to leave Colin to Martha or any one else who would take her place.Mary had never liked her, and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood giggling into her handkerchief.."
"“你笑什么？”玛丽问她。","“What are you laughing at?” she asked her."
"“笑你们这两个小孩，”护士说。“对这个被惯坏的家伙，最好的事情就是有一个和他一样被宠坏的小孩站出来和他作对；”她又拿手帕捂着嘴笑，“如果他有个泼辣的小妹妹和他对着干，那他就有救了。”","“At you two young ones,” said the nurse.“It’s the best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have some one to stand up to him that’s as spoiled as himself;” and she laughed into her handkerchief again.“If he’d had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it would have been the saving of him.”"
"“他会死吗？”","“Is he going to die?”"
"“我不知道，也不在乎，”护士说，“他的病有一半是歇斯底里和坏脾气搞出来的。”","“I don’t know and I don’t care,” said the nurse.“Hysterics and temper are half what ails him.”"
"“什么是歇斯底里？”玛丽问。","“What are hysterics?” asked Mary."
"“如果你让他大发雷霆你就会知道了——但不管怎样，你已经给了他歇斯底里的理由，我很高兴。”","“You’ll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this—but at any rate you’ve given him something to have hysterics about, and I’m glad of it.”"
"玛丽回到了自己的房间，心情和刚从花园回来时完全不一样。她很生气，很失望，但一点也不可怜科林。她本想告诉他许许多多的事情，而且，是不是要把那个重大的秘密告诉科林，她本已打算要拿定主意了。她本来已觉得可以告诉他，但现在，她完全改变了看法。她永远也不会告诉他了，要是他喜欢，那就让他呆在自己房间里，永远呼吸不到新鲜空气，死掉算了。他活该！她很生气，紧绷着弦儿，有几分钟，她几乎忘记了迪肯，忘记了弥漫在天地间的绿色面纱，忘记了原野上吹来的和风。","Mary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when she had come in from the garden.She was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for Colin.She had looked forward to telling him a great many things and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be safe to trust him with the great secret.She had been beginning to think it would be, but now she had changed her mind entirely.She would never tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air and die if he liked!It would serve him right!She felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down from the moor."
"玛莎正在等她，她脸上的苦恼之色暂时换成了兴趣和好奇。桌上有个木盒，盖子被拿掉了，里面放满了整齐的包裹。　　“这是克雷文先生寄给你的，”玛莎说，“里面好像有图画书。”","Martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity.There was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages.“Mr. Craven sent it to you,” said Martha.“It looks as if it had picture-books in it.”"
"玛丽想起她去克雷文先生房间的那天，他问过她。“你想要什么呢——娃娃——玩具——书？”她拆开包裹，猜测着他会不会寄来一个娃娃，也琢磨着如果真寄了个娃娃，她要拿它怎么办。但他没寄娃娃。包裹里是几本漂亮的书，和科林的差不多，其中有两本是关于花园的，里面满是图片。还有两三套游戏，一个漂亮小巧的文具盒，上面有金色的名字首字母，另外还有一支金笔和墨水瓶。　　每样东西都很好，快乐渐渐将怒火挤出了她的脑海。她从不指望克雷文先生会惦记着自己，她冷漠的小小心灵也变得温暖起来。","Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room.“Do you want anything—dolls—toys—books?”She opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should do with it if he had.But he had not sent one.There were several beautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures.There were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand.Everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out of her mind.She had not expected him to remember her at all and her hard little heart grew quite warm."
"“我写字比刻字好多了，”她说，“我要用这支笔写的第一件份东西就是给他的信，告诉他我很感激。”","“I can write better than I can print,” she said, “and the first thing I shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am much obliged.”"
"如果她和科林还是朋友，她会马上跑去给他看她的礼物，他们就会一起欣赏图画，读园艺书，也许还会试着玩玩游戏，他会玩得很高兴，也就不会觉得自己快要死了，或是把手放在背上看看是不是长了个瘤子。玛丽无法忍受他那种做事方式。她会有种不舒服的恐惧感，因为科林自己就总是显得很恐惧。他说，如果哪天，他感觉到有个瘤子，哪怕是很小的一个，他也会知道，他开始驼背了。这个念头是他听梅德洛克太太和护士窃窃私语的时候冒出来的，然后他就自己默默地琢磨着这件事，直到这个想法在他脑中根深蒂固。梅德洛克太太说过，他父亲还是个孩子的时候就已经显出驼背的样子了。除了玛丽之外，他从没告诉过任何人，他那种别人所谓的“大发雷霆”多半来自于深埋在内心的恐惧。他告诉玛丽的时候，玛丽也可怜过他。　　“一旦他生气了或者累了，他就开始想这些了，”玛丽自言自语道，“今天他就很生气。也许——也许一下午他都在想这些。”","If she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him her presents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he would have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought he was going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was a lump coming.He had a way of doing that which she could not bear.It gave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself.He said that if he felt even quite a little lump some day he should know his hunch had begun to grow.Something he had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind.Mrs. Medlock had said his father’s back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he was a child.He had never told any one but Mary that most of his “tantrums” as they called them grew out of his hysterical hidden fear.Mary had been sorry for him when he had told her.“He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,” she said to herself.“And he has been cross today.Perhaps—perhaps he has been thinking about it all afternoon.”"
"她静静地站着，低头看着地毯，思索着。　　“我说过我再也不会回去了——”她犹豫了一下，皱起了眉——“但有可能，仅仅是可能，我会去看看——他是否需要我——在早上。 也许他又要用枕头砸我了，但是——我想——我会去的。”","She stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.“I said I would never go back again—” she hesitated, knitting her brows—“but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see—if he wants me—in the morning.Perhaps he’ll try to throw his pillow at me again, but—I think—I’ll go.”"
"第十七章 大发雷霆","CHAPTER XVII A TANTRUM"
"玛丽起得很早，在花园里干得很卖力，所以又累又困，吃了玛莎送来的晚餐后，她就想上床去了。她枕着枕头轻声地自言自语道，","She had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden and she was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought her supper and she had eaten it, she was glad to go to bed.As she laid her head on the pillow she murmured to herself:"
"“明天我要在吃早餐之前出门，去和迪肯一起干活，然后——我觉得——我会去看看他的。”","“I’ll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward—I believe—I’ll go to see him.”"
"大约在半夜，她被一阵可怕的声音惊醒，一下子跳下了床。那是什么——那是什么？不一会儿她就便确定自己知道那是什么了。一扇扇门开了又关上了，走廊里传来匆忙的脚步声，同时又有人在哭喊，在尖叫，那哭叫的方式甚是吓人。","She thought it was the middle of the night when she was awakened by such dreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant.What was it—what was it?The next minute she felt quite sure she knew.Doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and some one was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and crying in a horrible way."
"“是科林，”她说，“他正发脾气呢，护士们称为歇斯底里的那种。听起来好吓人啊。”","“It’s Colin,” she said.“He’s having one of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics.How awful it sounds.”"
"听着科林抽抽噎噎的哭叫，玛丽不再奇怪为什么大家都那么害怕，宁愿样样顺着他，也不愿听到这尖叫声了。她捂住了耳朵，觉得眩晕、发抖。","As she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that people were so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything rather than hear them.She put her hands over her ears and felt sick and shivering."
"“我不知该怎么办。我不知该怎么办，”她不停地说，“我受不了了。”","“I don’t know what to do.I don’t know what to do,” she kept saying.“I can’t bear it.”"
"她想过，如果她敢去找他，他是否能停下来，但她又想起了他是怎么把她赶出房间的，于是又觉得自己的出现可能会让他变本加厉。她把耳朵捂得更紧，但还是挡不住那可怕的声音。她对那种声音又恨又怕，突然间她被激怒了，觉得自己也应该发一通火来吓住科林，就像他现在吓到了她一样。她不习惯任何人发脾气，除了她自己。她把手从耳朵上拿下来，又跳又跺脚。","Once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then she remembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought that perhaps the sight of her might make him worse.Even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful sounds out.She hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her angry and she felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her.She was not used to any one’s tempers but her own.She took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot."
"“他得停下来！该有人去制止他！该有人去揍他！”她叫道。","“He ought to be stopped!Somebody ought to make him stop!Somebody ought to beat him!” she cried out."
"这时，她听到有人沿着走廊跑来，然后门开了，护士进来了。这会儿她笑意全无，甚至显得很苍白。","Just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door opened and the nurse came in.She was not laughing now by any means. She even looked rather pale."
"“他把自己弄得歇斯底里了，”她急急忙忙地说，“他会伤了自己的。没人能拿他怎么样。你来试试看吧，做个好孩子。他喜欢你。”","“He’s worked himself into hysterics,” she said in a great hurry.“He’ll do himself harm.No one can do anything with him.You come and try, like a good child.He likes you.”"
"“今天上午他还把我赶出房间了呢。”玛丽跺着脚激动地说。","“He turned me out of the room this morning,” said Mary, stamping her foot with excitement."
"她这一跺脚却让护士高兴起来。其实她之前还担心会看到玛丽躲在被子下哭。","The stamp rather pleased the nurse.The truth was that she had been afraid she might find Mary crying and hiding her head under the bed-clothes."
"“这就对了，”她说，“你的态度是对的。你去骂他一顿。让他想点新的东西。去吧，孩子，越快越好。”","“That’s right,” she said.“You’re in the right humor.You go and scold him.Give him something new to think of.Do go, child, as quick as ever you can.”"
"直到事后，玛丽才意识到这事又可笑又可怕——可笑的是，所有的大人都被吓住了，居然来求助于一个小姑娘，就因为他们觉得这个小姑娘和科林是半斤八两。","It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had been funny as well as dreadful—that it was funny that all the grown-up people were so frightened that they came to a little girl just because they guessed she was almost as bad as Colin himself."
"她沿着走廊一路飞奔，离尖叫声越近，她的火气就越大。跑到门口时，她觉得自己已经怒不可遏了。她用手拍开门，穿过房间，来到了四柱床前。","She flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the higher her temper mounted.She felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door.She slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room to the four-posted bed."
"“停下！”她几乎是在大叫了，“停下！我讨厌你！每个人都讨厌你！但愿大家都跑出这个房子，就剩你自己尖叫到死！你一会儿就会尖叫死，真希望是这样！”一个有同情心的好孩子是不会这么想，也不会这么说的，但巧就巧在这歇斯底里的男孩虽然无人敢管束也无人敢顶撞，但那些话给他带来的震惊却能收到最好的效果。","“You stop!” she almost shouted.“You stop!I hate you!Everybody hates you!I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death!You will scream yourself to death in a minute, and I wish you would!”A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such things, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the best possible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared to restrain or contradict."
"他本来正脸朝下躺着，双手拍打着枕头，就差跳来跳去了，而一听到那怒气冲冲的声音，他马上转过脸来。他的脸看上去很吓人，苍白，泛着红，还很肿，他抽抽噎噎地喘着气；但野蛮的小玛丽毫不在乎。","He had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he actually almost jumped around, he turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little voice.His face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen, and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did not care an atom."
"“你要再敢尖叫一下，”她说，“我就也叫——我可以叫得比你响，我要吓死你，我要吓死你！”","“If you scream another scream,” she said, “I’ll scream too—and I can scream louder than you can and I’ll frighten you, I’ll frighten you!”"
"他确实停止了尖叫，因为玛丽吓住了他。那一声正要逸出的尖叫几乎让他喘不过气。眼泪顺着他的脸颊流下来，他浑身都在发抖。","He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so.The scream which had been coming almost choked him.The tears were streaming down his face and he shook all over."
"“我不能停下来！”他喘着气，啜泣着，“我不能——我不能！”","“I can’t stop!” he gasped and sobbed.“I can’t—I can’t!”"
"“你可以！”玛丽叫道。“你的病有一半就是歇斯底里和坏脾气搞出来的——就是歇斯底里——歇斯底里——歇斯底里！”她每叫一声就跺一次脚。","“You can!” shouted Mary.“Half that ails you is hysterics and temper—just hysterics—hysterics—hysterics!” and she stamped each time she said it."
"“我摸到那个瘤子了——我摸到了，”科林抽噎着说，“我就知道会长瘤子的。我的背会驼，然后我就死了。”他又开始挣扎，扭曲着脸部肌肉，呜咽、哭泣，但没有尖叫。","“I felt the lump—I felt it,” choked out Colin.“I knew I should.I shall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,” and he began to writhe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he didn’t scream."
"“你才没摸到瘤子呢！”玛丽愤怒地反驳，“你要真能摸到，那也只是个歇斯底里的瘤子。歇斯底里会让你长瘤子。你那讨厌的背什么事儿都没有——除了歇斯底里！转过去，让我看看！”","“You didn’t feel a lump!” contradicted Mary fiercely.“If you did it was only a hysterical lump.Hysterics makes lumps.There’s nothing the matter with your horrid back—nothing but hysterics!Turn over and let me look at it!”"
"她很喜欢“歇斯底里”这个词，觉得好像这个词对他有效果。很可能他也和她一样从没听到过这个词。","She liked the word “hysterics” and felt somehow as if it had an effect on him.He was probably like herself and had never heard it before."
"“护士，”她命令道，“马上过来，让我看看他的背！”","“Nurse,” she commanded, “come here and show me his back this minute!”"
"护士、梅德洛克太太和玛莎一起挤在门边站着，目瞪口呆地看着玛丽。她们三个都不止一次被吓得直喘气。护士上前来，好像她还没那么害怕。科林哭得喘不过气，身体起伏着。","The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled together near the door staring at her, their mouths half open.All three had gasped with fright more than once.The nurse came forward as if she were half afraid.Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs."
"“可能他——他不会让我碰他。”她犹豫着小声说。","“Perhaps he—he won’t let me,” she hesitated in a low voice."
"但科林听到了，他在抽泣的间歇喘着气说，","Colin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two sobs:"
"“让——让她看！她——她看了就知道了！”","“Sh-show her!She-she’ll see then!”"
"他光裸的脊背看上去瘦得可怜。一根根肋骨和脊柱上的一个个关节都清晰可数，但玛丽小姐并没有数，她只是弯着腰，绷着一张野蛮的小脸检查着。她看上去那么苛刻又那么装模作样，惹得护士转过头去掩饰她嘴角的抽搐。玛丽上上下下地检查着科林的脊柱，一遍又一遍，专注得好像她是来自伦敦的名医，这一小段时间大家都沉默着，就连科林都努力屏住了呼吸。","It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared.Every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not count them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face.She looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth.There was just a minute’s silence, for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary looked up and down his spine, and down and up, as intently as if she had been the great doctor from London."
"“你背上一个瘤都没有！”她终于开口道，“就连针尖大小的瘤都没有——除了脊柱骨节之外，你能摸到它们是因为你太瘦了。我自己脊柱上也有骨节，以前它们也像你的骨节一样突出，直到我开始长胖才好一点，但我还没胖到能把这些骨节掩盖起来的地步。你背上连针尖大小的瘤都没有！如果你还硬要说有，我会笑的！”","“There’s not a single lump there!” she said at last.“There’s not a lump as big as a pin—except backbone lumps, and you can only feel them because you’re thin.I’ve got backbone lumps myself, and they used to stick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am not fat enough yet to hide them.There’s not a lump as big as a pin!If you ever say there is again, I shall laugh!”"
"除了科林自己，没人知道这些愠怒的、孩子气的话对他产生了什么效果。如果有人能听他倾诉他内心的恐惧——如果他敢提出问题——如果他有小伙伴陪他，而非独自仰卧在封闭的大房子里，连呼吸的空气也满载着人们的担忧，那些人中的大多数是无知的，而且已经厌倦了他，若非如此，他也许就能发现，自己多数的恐惧和病痛都是自己编造出来的。但是，每刻，每天，每月，每年，他都躺在那里，想着自己，还有自己的痛苦和疲倦。而现在，一个怒气冲冲的、毫无同情心的小女孩固执地认为他的病并没有他想象中的那样严重，他竟觉得她说的很可能是实话。","No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had on him.If he had ever had any one to talk to about his secret terrors—if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions—if he had had childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed house, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out that most of his fright and illness was created by himself.But he had lain and thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years.And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was he actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth."
"“我不知道他以为自己脊柱上有个瘤。”护士壮着胆子说，“他的背很无力，因为他不愿意试着坐起来。否则我就会告诉他那里没长瘤子。”科林吸了口气，略略转过脸看着她。","“I didn’t know,” ventured the nurse, “that he thought he had a lump on his spine.His back is weak because he won’t try to sit up.I could have told him there was no lump there.”Colin gulped and turned his face a little to look at her."
"“你——你会吗？”他可怜兮兮地问。","“C-could you?” he said pathetically."
"“会的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“看！”玛丽也猛吸了一口气说。","“There!” said Mary, and she gulped too."
"科林脸上的肌肉又开始动了，但这次他只是为了深呼吸几下，有时还断断续续的，这说明他那场抽泣的风暴正渐渐平息，他一动不动地躺了一会儿，虽然仍有豆大的泪珠顺着脸流下来，弄湿了枕头。实际上，这泪水对他来说意味着一种奇特的、巨大的解脱。一会儿他又转头望着护士，奇怪的是，他对她说话时完全不像个王爷了。","Colin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn broken breaths, which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing, he lay still for a minute, though great tears streamed down his face and wet the pillow.Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him.Presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a Rajah at all as he spoke to her."
"“你觉得——我可以——活到长大吗？”他说。","“Do you think—I could—live to grow up?” he said."
"这护士既不聪明也不善良，但她能够重复那个伦敦医生说过的一些话。","The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could repeat some of the London doctor’s words."
"“可能性很大，如果你能按要求去做，不要放任自己发火，还要多在户外新鲜空气里呆着。”","“You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.”"
"科林的气已经消了，他哭得虚弱无力，精疲力尽，这也许能让他给人温和的感觉。他微微向玛丽伸出手，让人高兴的是，玛丽的气也消了，也变温和了，她也伸手与科林半路相遇以示妥协，于是两人重归于好。","Colin’s tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying and this perhaps made him feel gentle.He put out his hand a little toward Mary, and I am glad to say that, her own tantum having passed, she was softened too and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was a sort of making up."
"“我想——我想和你一起出去，玛丽，”科林说，“我不会讨厌新鲜空气的，只要我们能找到——”好在他及时想起来了，且急忙打住，没说出“只要我们能找到秘密花园”，而改口道，“我很乐意和你一起出去，如果迪肯能来帮我推轮椅就好了。我真的很想见迪肯，还有狐狸和乌鸦。”","“I’ll—I’ll go out with you, Mary,” he said.“I shan’t hate fresh air if we can find—” He remembered just in time to stop himself from saying “if we can find the secret garden” and he ended, “I shall like to go out with you if Dickon will come and push my chair.I do so want to see Dickon and the fox and the crow.”"
"护士重新整理了一下乱糟糟的床，抖了抖枕头，又把它们拉直。她给科林做了杯牛肉汤，也给了玛丽一杯，在一番暴怒之余能喝到这个，玛丽很高兴。梅德洛克太太和玛莎高高兴兴地溜之大吉了，待一切都回复到整洁、平静、井井有条的状态时，护士好像也巴不得能开溜。她是个健康年轻的女人，很讨厌睡眠被剥夺，她一边望着玛丽，一边大大地打了个呵欠，而玛丽已经把自己的大脚凳挪到了四柱床边，她正握着科林的手。","The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows.Then she made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary, who really was very glad to get it after her excitement.Mrs. Medlock and Martha gladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also.She was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her sleep and she yawned quite openly as she looked at Mary, who had pushed her big footstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin’s hand."
"“你得回去睡觉了，”护士说，“他过会儿就会打瞌睡的——只要他不是太生气的话。然后我就去隔壁房间睡了。”","“You must go back and get your sleep out,” she said.“He’ll drop off after a while—if he’s not too upset.Then I’ll lie down myself in the next room.”"
"“我唱首从奶妈那里学来的歌给你听，好吗？”玛丽轻声对科林说。","“Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?”Mary whispered to Colin."
"科林轻轻地拉了拉玛丽的手，他疲倦的眼睛带着请求之色望向她。","His hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on her appealingly."
"“噢，好的！”他答道，“这是首很柔的歌。我一会儿就会睡着的。”","“Oh, yes!” he answered.“It’s such a soft song.I shall go to sleep in a minute.”"
"“我会哄他睡的，”玛丽对打着呵欠的护士说，“你想走就可以走了。”","“I will put him to sleep,” Mary said to the yawning nurse.“You can go if you like.”"
"“那么，”护士不情愿地说，“要是半小时后他还没睡着，你就来叫我。”","“Well,” said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance.“If he doesn’t go to sleep in half an hour you must call me.”"
"“没问题。”玛丽答道。","“Very well,” answered Mary."
"护士立刻就出去了，她一离开，科林又拉住了玛丽的手。","The nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone Colin pulled Mary’s hand again."
"“我差点说漏嘴，”他说，“但我及时打住了。我不想聊天了，我要睡了，但是你说过你有很多有趣的事情要告诉我。你有没有——你觉得通往秘密花园的路这事儿有眉目了么？”","“I almost told,” he said; “but I stopped myself in time.I won’t talk and I’ll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot of nice things to tell me.Have you—do you think you have found out anything at all about the way into the secret garden?”"
"玛丽望着他可怜又疲惫的小脸和肿胀的眼睛，便心软了。","Mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her heart relented."
"“呃——对，”她回答说，“我觉得有眉目了。如果你去睡觉，明天我就告诉你。”科林的手抖得很厉害。","“Ye-es,” she answered, “I think I have.And if you will go to sleep I will tell you tomorrow.”His hand quite trembled."
"“噢，玛丽！”他叫道，“噢，玛丽！如果我能进花园，我想我就可以活到长大了！你能不能不要唱奶妈教你的歌——你可以轻声地给我讲讲你想象中的花园是什么样子的，就像你第一天所做的那样。我保证这能让我睡着。”","“Oh, Mary!” he said.“Oh, Mary!If I could get into it I think I should live to grow up!Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah song—you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you imagine it looks like inside?I am sure it will make me go to sleep.”"
"“好啊，”玛丽回答道，“闭上眼睛。”","“Yes,” answered Mary.“Shut your eyes.”"
"他闭上眼睛，静静地躺着，玛丽拉着他的手，开始慢慢地、轻轻地讲起来。","He closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and began to speak very slowly and in a very low voice."
"“我想它被孤零零地遗忘在那儿太久了——于是它就自成一体，可爱得很。我想玫瑰们会爬啊爬啊爬啊，直到它们从树枝上和墙上垂下来，爬满整个地面——简直就像一层奇特的灰雾。有些玫瑰已经死了，但还有很多——还活着，夏天到来的时候，就会有许多玫瑰帘子和玫瑰喷泉。我想遍地都是黄水仙、雪花莲、百合花和鸢尾，正努力向外冲破黑暗。现在，春天已经来了——也许——也许——”","“I think it has been left alone so long—that it has grown all into a lovely tangle.I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground—almost like a strange gray mist.Some of them have died but many—are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses.I think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark.Now the spring has begun—perhaps—perhaps—”"
"玛丽轻柔的声音让科林越来越安静，她看在眼里，嘴上仍继续讲着。","The soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and she saw it and went on."
"“也许它们会从草丛里冒出来——也许会有一簇簇紫色番红花，还有金色的——甚至现在就有了。也许树叶已经开始冒出来了，舒展开了——也许——灰色正在消退，绿色轻纱正在蔓延——笼罩住——一切。小鸟也会过来看这个花园——因为它——那么安全，那么宁静。也许——也许——也许——”她说得很轻，很慢，“知更鸟已经找了个伴儿——正在搭窝。”","“Perhaps they are coming up through the grass—perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones—even now.Perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl—and perhaps—the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping—and creeping over—everything.And the birds are coming to look at it—because it is—so safe and still.And perhaps—perhaps—perhaps—” very softly and slowly indeed, “the robin has found a mate—and is building a nest.”"
"科林进入了梦乡。","And Colin was asleep."
"第十八章 “你绝对不能浪费时间”","CHAPTER XVIII “THA’ MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME”"
"当然，第二天早晨玛丽没能早早醒来。她起晚了，因为她很累。玛莎来给她送早餐的时告诉她，虽然科林很安静，但是他病了，发烧了，每次他大哭大闹把自己弄得精疲力尽之后总会这样。","Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning.She slept late because she was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she told her that though Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying."
"玛丽一边慢吞吞地吃着早餐一边听着。","Mary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened."
"“他说他希望你能够尽快去看他，”玛莎说，“真奇怪他竟对你这么着迷。昨晚你的确给了他点厉害瞧瞧——是不是？没人敢那么干。啊！可怜的孩子！他已经被惯得无可救药了。妈妈说，对一个孩子来说，最糟糕的情形无非两种，永远不能如意——或者就是可以为所欲为。她不知道哪一种更糟。你自己也发了很大脾气。但是，我进他房间的时候，他说，‘请问问玛丽小姐是否能过来和我说说话？’想想看，他竟然说请！你会去吗，小姐？”“我先得跑去见迪肯。”玛丽说。“不，我要先去见科林，告诉他——我知道我要告诉他什么。”她突然灵光一闪。","“He says he wishes tha’ would please go and see him as soon as tha’ can,” Martha said.“It’s queer what a fancy he’s took to thee.Tha’ did give it him last night for sure—didn’t tha?Nobody else would have dared to do it.Eh! poor lad!He’s been spoiled till salt won’t save him.Mother says as th’ two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way—or always to have it.She doesn’t know which is th’ worst.Tha’ was in a fine temper tha’self, too.But he says to me when I went into his room, ‘Please ask Miss Mary if she’ll please come an’ talk to me?’Think o’ him saying please!Will you go, Miss?”“I’ll run and see Dickon first,” said Mary.“No, I’ll go and see Colin first and tell him—I know what I’ll tell him,” with a sudden inspiration."
"出现在科林房里时，玛丽戴着帽子，有那么一瞬，科林看上去很失落。他躺在床上。他的脸苍白得可怜，眼睛周围有黑眼圈。","She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin’s room and for a second he looked disappointed.He was in bed.His face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his eyes."
"“真高兴你能来，”他说，“我头疼，浑身都疼，因为我太累了。你要出门吗？”","“I’m glad you came,” he said.“My head aches and I ache all over because I’m so tired.Are you going somewhere?”"
"玛丽走上前，靠在他床上。","Mary went and leaned against his bed."
"“我不会出去很久，”她说，“我去见见迪肯，但我会回来的。科林，我是——我是为了花园的事。”","“I won’t be long,” she said.“I’m going to Dickon, but I’ll come back.Colin, it’s—it’s something about the garden.”"
"他的整张脸亮了起来，也有了一丝血色。","His whole face brightened and a little color came into it."
"“噢！是吗？”他叫了起来，“整个晚上我都在做关于花园的梦，昨天我听到你说什么灰色变成绿色，我梦见我站在一个地方，那里全都是抖动着的小绿叶——到处都是正在孵蛋的小鸟，它们看起来那么柔软，那么安静。我会躺在这里想想这事儿，直到你回来。”","“Oh! is it?” he cried out.“I dreamed about it all night I heard you say something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves—and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.I’ll lie and think about it until you come back.”"
"五分钟后，玛丽就和迪肯一起在花园里了。狐狸和乌鸦还是同迪肯在一起，而且，这次他还带了两只驯良的松鼠过来。“今天早上我是骑小马过来的，”他说，“啊！这小家伙是好样的——他叫跳跳！这两只松鼠，我是装在口袋里带来的。这边的一只叫坚果，那边的叫果壳。”","In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden.The fox and the crow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame squirrels.“I came over on the pony this mornin’,” he said.“Eh! he is a good little chap—Jump is!I brought these two in my pockets.This here one he’s called Nut an’ this here other one’s called Shell.”"
"他说到“坚果”的时候，一只松鼠就跳到了他右边的肩膀上，说到“果壳”的时候，另一只跳到了他左边的肩膀上。","When he said “Nut” one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and when he said “Shell” the other one leaped on to his left shoulder."
"他们坐在草地上，船长蜷缩在他们脚边，煤烟严肃地站在树上听着，坚果和果壳在他们附近探索着，玛丽觉得她舍不得离开这个乐园，但是当她讲起她的故事时，迪肯滑稽的脸上流露出的神色使她改变了主意。她看得出来，迪肯比她更可怜科林。他抬头望天，又环顾四周。","When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to them, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness, but when she began to tell her story somehow the look in Dickon’s funny face gradually changed her mind.She could see he felt sorrier for Colin than she did.He looked up at the sky and all about him."
"“听听这鸟叫声——好像满世界都是——它们都在吹哨、演奏。”他说。“看它们冲过来冲过去，听它们彼此呼唤。春天来了，整个世界好像都在呼唤着。树叶舒展开了，你就能看见它们——啊呀，味道还挺好闻的呢！”迪肯快乐地仰起鼻子嗅着，“那个可怜的孩子被关在屋里躺着，能看到的太少，所以就开始胡思乱想，把自己逼得尖声大叫。啊！天哪！我们必修带他出去——我们必修带他出来看看，听听，呼吸呼吸新鲜空气，在阳光里泡一会儿。我们角对不能浪费时间了。”","“Just listen to them birds—th’ world seems full of ‘em—all whistlin’ an’ pipin’,” he said.“Look at ‘em dartin’ about, an’ hearken at ‘em callin’ to each other.Come springtime seems like as if all th’ world’s callin’.The leaves is uncurlin’ so you can see ‘em—an’, my word, th’ nice smells there is about!” sniffing with his happy turned-up nose.“An’ that poor lad lyin’ shut up an’ seein’ so little that he gets to thinkin’ o’ things as sets him screamin’.Eh! my! we mun get him out here—we mun get him watchin’ an listenin’ an’ sniffin’ up th’ air an’ get him just soaked through wi’ sunshine.An’ we munnot lose no time about it.”"
"他兴致高涨的时候，约克郡口音就会很重，尽管别的时候他会尽量纠正方言口音，好让玛丽听得更明白。但她喜欢他那浓重的约克郡口音，其实她还试着学过。所以，现在她也能说一点。","When he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshire though at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary could better understand.But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself.So she spoke a little now."
"“哎，我们必修这样做，”她说（她的意思是“是的，我们必须这样做”）。“我来告诉你第一步该怎么做。”玛丽继续说道。迪肯咧开嘴笑了，这个小姑娘拧着舌头说约克郡话的样子把他逗乐了。“他可喜欢你了。他想见你，还有煤烟和船长。我回屋里和他聊天时，会问问他明天早晨能不能让你去看看他——带上你的伙伴们——然后——过一段时间，等更多叶子长出来，还有了一两个花苞的时候，我们就带他出来，你来推他的轮椅，我们把他带到这里，让他看看这一切。”","“Aye, that we mun,” she said (which meant “Yes, indeed, we must”).“I’ll tell thee what us’ll do first,” she proceeded, and Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused him very much.“He’s took a graidely fancy to thee.He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an’ Captain.When I go back to the house to talk to him I’ll ax him if tha’ canna’ come an’ see him tomorrow mornin’—an’. bring tha’ creatures wi’ thee—an’ then—in a bit, when there’s more leaves out, an’ happen a bud or two, we’ll get him to come out an’ tha’ shall push him in his chair an’ we’ll bring him here an’ show him everything.”"
"她说完后很为自己感到骄傲。之前她从未用约克郡口音讲过那么一大段话，她学得很好。","When she stopped she was quite proud of herself.She had never made a long speech in Yorkshire before and she had remembered very well."
"“你必修对科林少爷说点那样的约克郡话，”迪肯咯咯笑道，“这会把他逗笑的，对病人来说，没有什么比大笑更好的了。妈妈说，她相信每天早晨大笑半小时就可以治好一个要得斑疹伤寒的人。”","“Tha’ mun talk a bit o’ Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,” Dickon chuckled.“Tha’ll make him laugh an’ there’s nowt as good for ill folk as laughin’ is.Mother says she believes as half a hour’s good laugh every mornin’ ‘ud cure a chap as was makin’ ready for typhus fever.”"
"“我今天就去对他讲约克郡话。”玛丽自己也笑着说。","“I’m going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,” said Mary, chuckling herself."
"花园已逢盛时，每天每夜仿佛都有魔法师经过，用魔杖从土壤和树干中汲取出美丽。扔下一切离开这里是很难的，尤其是此时，坚果正爬上玛丽的裙子，而果壳则从他们上方那棵苹果树的树干上窜了下来，站在那里用探询的眼光打量着她。但她还是回屋了。当她坐到科林床边时，她也开始像迪肯那样嗅着，尽管不如迪肯那么熟练。","The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands.It was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her dress and Shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her with inquiring eyes.But she went back to the house and when she sat down close to Colin’s bed he began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced way."
"“你身上好像有花香，还有——还有新鲜的东西，”科林愉快地叫起来，“你闻出了什么味道？又凉爽又温暖又香甜，混在一块儿了。”","“You smell like flowers and—and fresh things,” he cried out quite joyously.“What is it you smell of?It’s cool and warm and sweet all at the same time.”"
"“那是原野上吹过来的风，”玛丽说，“是我和迪肯、船长、煤烟、坚果还有果壳一起坐在树下的草坪上时染到的。春天户外阳光照耀，多嘛好闻啊。”","“It’s th’ wind from th’ moor,” said Mary.“It comes o’ sittin’ on th’ grass under a tree wi’ Dickon an’ wi’ Captain an’ Soot an’ Nut an’ Shell.It’s th’ springtime an’ out o’ doors an’ sunshine as smells so graidely.”"
"她尽可能加重自己的口音，若非亲耳听到，你不会知道约克郡的口音有多重。科林笑了起来。","She said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know how broadly Yorkshire sounds until you have heard some one speak it.Colin began to laugh."
"“你这是做什么啊？”他说，“以前我从来没听你这样讲话。听起来真滑稽。”","“What are you doing?” he said.“I never heard you talk like that before.How funny it sounds.”"
"“我给内讲点约克郡话，”玛丽得意地答道，“我讲得莫有迪肯和玛莎好，但内瞧，我可以学一点儿。内听约克郡话，难道一点都听不懂？内自己可是个土生土长的约克郡孩子！啊！我想知道内会不会脸红。”","“I’m givin’ thee a bit o’ Yorkshire,” answered Mary triumphantly.“I canna’ talk as graidely as Dickon an’ Martha can but tha’ sees I can shape a bit.Doesn’t tha’ understand a bit o’ Yorkshire when tha’ hears it?An’ tha’ a Yorkshire lad thysel’ bred an’ born!Eh! I wonder tha’rt not ashamed o’ thy face.”"
"接着玛丽也笑了，两人笑得停都停不下来，笑得满屋子都是回声，梅德洛克太太打开门，本想进来，却又退回到走廊里，站在那儿惊奇地听着。","And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed."
"“啊，我的天哪！”她自己也用很重的约克郡口音自言自语，因为别人听不到她说话，而她自己又那样震惊，“谁听到过内个！这世界上谁想得到哇！”","“Well, upon my word!” she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herself because there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished.“Whoever heard th’ like!Whoever on earth would ha’ thought it!”"
"要聊的有很多。关于迪肯、船长、煤烟、坚果、果壳还有那匹叫跳跳的小马，科林似乎永远都听不厌。玛丽和迪肯兜着圈子跑到林子里看过跳跳。它是匹小小的，毛发蓬松的原野马驹，浓密的鬃毛垂到眼睛上，脸很漂亮，柔软的鼻子轻轻蹭着。它吃的是原野上的草，所以相当瘦，但是它精悍结实，好像他那瘦腿上的肌肉都是用钢制弹簧做成的。它一看到迪肯就抬起头轻声嘶叫，并朝他小跑过去，让头越过他的肩膀，迪肯对它耳语，而它则回之以奇怪轻柔的嘶叫、喘息和喷气。迪肯让它向玛丽伸出小小的前蹄，并用柔软的口鼻亲吻她的脸颊。","There was so much to talk about.It seemed as if Colin could never hear enough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was Jump.Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump.He was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose.He was rather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been made of steel springs.He had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw Dickon and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder and then Dickon had talked into his ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts.Dickon had made him give Mary his small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle."
"“迪肯说的话它真的都能听懂吗？”科林问。","“Does he really understand everything Dickon says?” Colin asked."
"“好像是的。”玛丽回答说，“迪肯说，只要你们确确实实是朋友，那么任何动物都听得懂，但是，你们必须确确实实是朋友。”","“It seems as if he does,” answered Mary.“Dickon says anything will understand if you’re friends with it for sure, but you have to be friends for sure.”"
"科林静静地躺了一会儿，他那奇特的灰眼睛好像正盯着墙壁，但是玛丽看得出来，他在思考。","Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking."
"“我希望我是它们的朋友，”他终于说道，“但我不是。我从来没交过朋友，我受不了别人。”","“I wish I was friends with things,” he said at last, “but I’m not.I never had anything to be friends with, and I can’t bear people.”"
"“你也受不了我吗？”玛丽问。","“Can’t you bear me?” asked Mary."
"“不，我受得了。”他回答说，“这很滑稽，但我甚至还喜欢你。”","“Yes, I can,” he answered.“It’s funny but I even like you.”"
"“本•韦瑟斯塔夫说，我和他很像，”玛丽说，“他说，他敢保证我们俩脾气一样坏。我觉得你也和他很像。我们三个都很像——你和我还有本•韦瑟斯塔夫。他说我们两个都没什么好看的，而且，我们内心和外表一样怪癖。但现在，我觉得自己没有认识知更鸟和迪肯之前那样怪癖了。”","“Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,” said Mary.“He said he’d warrant we’d both got the same nasty tempers.I think you are like him too.We are all three alike—you and I and Ben Weatherstaff.He said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked.But I don’t feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and Dickon.”"
"“你觉得自己讨厌别人吗？”","“Did you feel as if you hated people?”"
"“是的，”玛丽毫不掩饰地回答，“如果我在遇到知更鸟和迪肯之前见到你，我也会讨厌你的。”","“Yes,” answered Mary without any affectation.“I should have detested you if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.”"
"科林伸出瘦弱的手，碰了碰她。","Colin put out his thin hand and touched her."
"“玛丽，”他说，“我真希望我没有说过要把迪肯赶走之类的话。你说他像个天使的时候，我恨你，嘲笑你，但——但也许他真的是。”","“Mary,” he said, “I wish I hadn’t said what I did about sending Dickon away.I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I laughed at you but—but perhaps he is.”"
"“啊，其实这么说还挺滑稽的，”她坦白承认，“因为他的鼻子确实是翘起来的，嘴也很大，而且衣服上满是补丁，他的约克郡口音还很重，但是——但是如果一个天使真的来到了约克郡，住在原野上——如果真有个约克郡天使的话——我相信他一定了解那些绿色的生物，知道怎样让它们生长，他也一定知道怎么和野生动物交谈，就像迪肯那样，而那些动物也会知道，他确实是他们的朋友。”","“Well, it was rather funny to say it,” she admitted frankly, “because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but—but if an angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor—if there was a Yorkshire angel—I believe he’d understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon does and they’d know he was friends for sure.”"
"“我不会介意迪肯看着我，”科林说，“我想见见他。”","“I shouldn’t mind Dickon looking at me,” said Colin; “I want to see him.”"
"“你这样说我真高兴，”玛丽回答，“因为——因为——”","“I’m glad you said that,” answered Mary, “because—because—”"
"突然之间，她脑海中闪过一个念头，现在是时候告诉科林了。科林知道他要听到新鲜事了。","Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tell him.Colin knew something new was coming."
"“因为什么？”他迫不及待地叫道。","“Because what?” he cried eagerly."
"玛丽非常不安，她从凳子上站了起来，走到科林跟前，握住了他的双手。","Mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and caught hold of both his hands."
"“我可以信任你吗？我信任迪肯，因为鸟儿们信任他。我可以信任你吗——肯定可以吗——肯定可以吗？”她恳求地问道。","“Can I trust you?I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him.Can I trust you—for sure—for sure?” she implored."
"她的脸那样严肃，科林的回答几乎像是耳语。","Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer."
"“可以——可以！”","“Yes—yes!”"
"“那么，明天早晨迪肯会来见你，他会带他的动物们一起来的。”","“Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning, and he’ll bring his creatures with him.”"
"“噢！噢！”科林高兴地叫道。","“Oh! Oh!” Colin cried out in delight."
"“但还没完，”玛丽接着说，郑重而激动的心情让她的脸几近苍白，“好事还在后头。花园有道门。被我发现了。就在墙上的常春藤下面。”","“But that’s not all,” Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement.“The rest is better.There is a door into the garden.I found it.It is under the ivy on the wall.”"
"如果科林是个强健的男孩，他多半就会欢呼“万岁！万岁！万岁！”了，但是他既虚弱，又异常兴奋，只能把眼睛睁得越来越大，大口喘着气。","If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted “Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” but he was weak and rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath."
"“噢！玛丽！”他半带哭腔地叫道，“我能看看花园吗？我能进花园吗？我能活到进花园的那天吗？”他握紧了她的手，把她拉向自己。","“Oh! Mary!” he cried out with a half sob.“Shall I see it?Shall I get into it?Shall I live to get into it?” and he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him."
"“你当然能看到花园！”玛丽愤然叫道，“你当然能活到进花园的那天！别犯傻了！”","“Of course you’ll see it!” snapped Mary indignantly.“Of course you’ll live to get into it!Don’t be silly!”"
"她并不歇斯底里，而是很自然又孩子气，所以她让科林恢复了理智，他开始笑话自己。几分钟后，她又坐回凳子上，这回她所讲的并不是她想像中的花园，而是花园真实的样子，科林忘记了病痛和疲劳，出神地听着。","And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she brought him to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what she imagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, and Colin’s aches and tiredness were forgotten and he was listening enraptured."
"“花园的样子和你原来想像的一样，”最后他说，“听起来好像你真的亲眼见过似的。你知道，你第一次告诉我的时候我就这么说过。”","“It is just what you thought it would be,” he said at last.“It sounds just as if you had really seen it.You know I said that when you told me first.”"
"玛丽犹豫了大约两分钟，随即大胆道出了真相。","Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth."
"“我已经见过花园了——我进去过，”她说，“几个礼拜之前，我找到了钥匙，进去了。但我不敢告诉你——我不敢，因为我很担心我不能信任你——确确实实地信任你！”","“I had seen it—and I had been in,” she said.“I found the key and got in weeks ago.But I daren’t tell you—I daren’t because I was so afraid I couldn’t trust you—for sure!”"
"第十九章 “它来了！”","CHAPTER XIX “IT HAS COME!”"
"当然，科林大发雷霆后第二天的早晨，便有人去请克雷文医生来。每次这样的事情一发生，马上就会有人来请他，而他抵达时，总是会看到一个苍白的男孩颤抖着躺在床上，气呼呼的，仍然那么歇斯底里，好像随时会因为只言片语而重新哭起来。实际上，克雷文医生对那几次棘手的出诊很是畏惧和厌恶。这一次，他去了离米瑟斯维特庄园很远的地方，下午才回来。","Of course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning after Colin had had his tantrum.He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his bed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least word.In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested the difficulties of these visits.On this occasion he was away from Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon."
"“他怎么样了？”克雷文医生抵达的时候相当愠怒地向梅德洛克太太询问，“总有一天，哪次发作会让他弄裂自己的血管的。这孩子被歇斯底里症和他的任性搞得疯了一半儿了。”","“How is he?” he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he arrived.“He will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day.The boy is half insane with hysteria and self-indulgence.”"
"“啊，先生，”梅德洛克太太回答说，“你见到他时，你会不敢相信自己的眼睛的。那个相貌平平，总是拉着脸的孩子，脾气和他差不多糟糕，却把他给迷住了。真不知她是怎么做到的。天晓得，她可没什么好看的，你也难得才听到她说句话，但是她做了我们谁都不敢做的。昨晚她像只小猫一样朝他扑过去，跺着脚命令他停止尖叫，不知怎么的就把他给吓住了，所以他真的停下来了，而今天下午——嗯，过来瞧瞧吧，先生。真是难以置信。”","“Well, sir,” answered Mrs. Medlock, “you’ll scarcely believe your eyes when you see him.That plain sour-faced child that’s almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him.How she’s done it there’s no telling.The Lord knows she’s nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak, but she did what none of us dare do.She just flew at him like a little cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop, and this afternoon—well just come up and see, sir.It’s past crediting.”"
"克雷文医生踏进他病人的房间时所看到的那一幕实在让他大为震惊。梅德洛克太太把门打开时，他听到了谈笑声。科林穿着晨衣坐在沙发上，他坐得很直，正一边看着园艺书里的一幅图画一边和那个长相平平的孩子说话，此时此刻，很难说那是个长相平平的孩子了，因为快乐让她的脸庞光彩照人。","The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient’s room was indeed rather astonishing to him.As Mrs. Medlock opened the door he heard laughing and chattering.Colin was on his sofa in his dressing-gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment."
"“那些长长的蓝色螺旋——我们要种很多，”科林宣布，“它们叫做飞——燕——草。”","“Those long spires of blue ones—we’ll have a lot of those,” Colin was announcing.“They’re called Del-phin-iums.”"
"“迪肯说它们是养大养好看了的燕草，”玛丽小姐叫道，“那里已经有好多丛了。”","“Dickon says they’re larkspurs made big and grand,” cried Mistress Mary.“There are clumps there already.”"
"然后他们看见了克雷文医生，便停了下来。玛丽变得非常安静，而科林则显得很烦躁。","Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped.Mary became quite still and Colin looked fretful."
"“听说昨晚你病了，我很难过，我的孩子。”克雷文医生略微有些紧张地说。他是个容易紧张的人。","“I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,” Dr. Craven said a trifle nervously.He was rather a nervous man."
"“我现在好些了——好多了，”科林像个王爷一样答道，“过一两天，要是天气好，我要坐轮椅出去。我想呼吸点新鲜空气。”","“I’m better now—much better,” Colin answered, rather like a Rajah.“I’m going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine.I want some fresh air.”"
"克雷文医生在他身旁坐下，为他诊了脉，然后好奇地看着他。","Dr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at him curiously."
"“天气一定得非常好，”他说，“你自也要格外小心，不要累着。”","“It must be a very fine day,” he said, “and you must be very careful not to tire yourself.”"
"“新鲜空气不会累着我的。”这年轻的王爷说。","“Fresh air won’t tire me,” said the young Rajah."
"曾经有好多次这年轻人都愤怒地大声尖叫，坚持说新鲜空气会冻着他，置他于死地，所以这次他的医生感到震惊也不足为奇。","As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold and kill him, it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat startled."
"“我还以为你不喜欢新鲜空气呢。”他说。","“I thought you did not like fresh air,” he said."
"“我独自一人的时候就不喜欢，”王爷回答，“但这次我表妹会陪我一起出去。”","“I don’t when I am by myself,” replied the Rajah; “but my cousin is going out with me.”"
"“当然还有护士咯？”克雷文医生建议道。","“And the nurse, of course?” suggested Dr. Craven."
"“不，我不要护士。”他那样高贵，玛丽不由自主地想起了那个年轻的土著王子，他浑身点缀着宝石、翡翠和珍珠，深色的小手上还有几块大大的红宝石，他一招手下令，仆人便过来行礼，听候吩咐。","“No, I will not have the nurse,” so magnificently that Mary could not help remembering how the young native Prince had looked with his diamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great rubies on the small dark hand he had waved to command his servants to approach with salaams and receive his orders."
"“我表妹知道怎么照顾我。她和我在一起时，我总是要好点儿。昨晚她让我感觉好些了。我认识的一个很强壮的男孩会帮我推轮椅。”","“My cousin knows how to take care of me.I am always better when she is with me.She made me better last night.A very strong boy I know will push my carriage.”"
"克雷文医生感到相当忧虑。如果这个讨厌的、歇斯底里的孩子碰巧好起来了，那么他自己就毫无继承米瑟斯维特庄园的可能了；但是，他虽软弱，却不是个没有道德的人，他并不想让科林冒险。","Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed.If this tiresome hysterical boy should chance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one, and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger."
"“他一定得是个强壮稳重的男孩，”他说，“我必须了解一下他。他是谁？叫什么名字？”","“He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,” he said.“And I must know something about him.Who is he?What is his name?”"
"“叫迪肯。”玛丽突然开口。不知怎么的，她觉得每个知道原野的人一定都认识迪肯。她是对的。她看到克雷文医生严肃的脸瞬间放松了，露出了宽心的微笑。","“It’s Dickon,” Mary spoke up suddenly.She felt somehow that everybody who knew the moor must know Dickon.And she was right, too.She saw that in a moment Dr. Craven’s serious face relaxed into a relieved smile."
"“噢，迪肯，”他说，“如果是迪肯的话，你就绝对安全了。他像原野上的小马驹一样强壮，那个迪肯。”","“Oh, Dickon,” he said.“If it is Dickon you will be safe enough.He’s as strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.”"
"“而且他很可靠，”玛丽说，“他是约克郡坠可靠的小伙子。”她一直在对科林说约克郡话，都有点忘乎所以了。","“And he’s trusty,” said Mary.“He’s th’ trustiest lad i’ Yorkshire.”She had been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she forgot herself."
"“这是迪肯教你的吗？”克雷文医生笑了起来，问道。","“Did Dickon teach you that?” asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright."
"“我把它当法语学，”玛丽冷冷地说，“它就像印度的一种方言。很聪明的人才会学。我喜欢约克郡话，科林也喜欢。”“好吧，好吧，”他说，“也许它对你们也没什么害处，只要你们觉得开心就好。昨晚你吃安眠药了吗，科林？”","“I’m learning it as if it was French,” said Mary rather coldly.“It’s like a native dialect in India.Very clever people try to learn them.I like it and so does Colin.”“Well, well,” he said.“If it amuses you perhaps it won’t do you any harm.Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?”"
"“没有，”科林回答，“一开始我不肯吃，后来玛丽让我安静了下来，我听她说话听睡着了——她声音很轻——跟我说关于春天溜进花园的事。”","“No,” Colin answered.“I wouldn’t take it at first and after Mary made me quiet she talked me to sleep—in a low voice—about the spring creeping into a garden.”"
"“听起来很安神啊。”克雷文医生说。他感到前所未有的困惑，又斜眼瞟了一下玛丽小姐，她正坐在凳子上，静静地垂眼盯着地毯。“你明显好些了，但是你要记住——”","“That sounds soothing,” said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking down silently at the carpet.“You are evidently better, but you must remember—”"
"“我不想记住，”话被打断，王爷的姿态又出现了，“我独自躺着，一想起来，就觉得浑身都疼，我就会开始想那些逼得我尖叫的事，因为我非常讨厌那些事。要是哪里有医生能让我忘记自己有病，而不是要我记住，我会派人带他过来。”他挥着瘦弱的手，那手上真该戴满带有皇室徽章的红宝石戒指。“因为我表妹让我忘了自己的病，所以她能让我好起来。”","“I don’t want to remember,” interrupted the Rajah, appearing again.“When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and I think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so.If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it I would have him brought here.”And he waved a thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies.“It is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes me better.”"
"科林“发威”之后，克雷文医逗留的时间从来都没有这么短；通常他都被迫留上很久，做上一大堆事情。这天下午，他没有开任何药，没留下任何新的嘱咐，也没看到任何不愉快的场面。下楼时，他若有所思，当他在书房和梅德洛克太太谈话时，她觉得他非常困惑。","Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a “tantrum”; usually he was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.This afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and he was spared any disagreeable scenes.When he went downstairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man."
"“啊，先生，”她试探着问道，“你能相信么？”","“Well, sir,” she ventured, “could you have believed it?”"
"“这肯定是个新情况，”医生说，“不可否认，这比原来的情形要好。”","“It is certainly a new state of affairs,” said the doctor.“And there’s no denying it is better than the old one.”"
"“我相信苏珊•索尔比是对的——我确实相信，”梅德洛克太太说，“昨天我去斯威特时在她的农舍停留过，我们聊了一会儿。她对我说，‘啊，萨拉•安，她也许不是个好孩子，也许也不漂亮，但她是个孩子，孩子就需要孩子。’我们以前一起上学的，苏珊•索尔比和我。”","“I believe Susan Sowerby’s right—I do that,” said Mrs. Medlock.“I stopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit of talk with her.And she says to me, ‘Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn’t be a good child, an’ she mayn’t be a pretty one, but she’s a child, an’ children needs children.’We went to school together, Susan Sowerby and me.”"
"“她是我所认识的最好的护病护士了，”克雷文医生说，“我在农舍见到她的时候，我就知道我有可能挽救自己的病人。”","“She’s the best sick nurse I know,” said Dr. Craven.“When I find her in a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.”"
"梅德洛克太太笑了。她很喜欢苏珊•索尔比。","Mrs. Medlock smiled.She was fond of Susan Sowerby."
"“苏珊自有她的办法，”她继续滔滔不绝地说，“整个上午我都在想昨天她说的一件事。她说，‘有一次孩子们打架之后，我给了他们一点教训，我对他们说，“我上学那会儿，地理老师告诉我们，地球的形状就像个橙子，没到十岁，我就发现，这个橙子不属于任何人。没人的领地能超过他该有的部分，有时候，好像地不够分。但是，你们不要——谁都不要——以为自己拥有整个橙子，不然，你们就会发现自己错了，不受点打击你们是不会明白的。”‘孩子从孩子那里学到的，’她说，‘就是攥住整个桔子——连皮带囊攥住是没有意义的。如果你非要这样，就很可能连核都得不到，而且果核太苦，不能吃。’”","“She’s got a way with her, has Susan,” she went on quite volubly.“I’ve been thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday.She says, ‘Once when I was givin’ th’ children a bit of a preach after they’d been fightin’ I ses to ‘em all, “When I was at school my jography told as th’ world was shaped like a orange an’ I found out before I was ten that th’ whole orange doesn’t belong to nobody.No one owns more than his bit of a quarter an’ there’s times it seems like there’s not enow quarters to go round.But don’t you—none o’ you—think as you own th’ whole orange or you’ll find out you’re mistaken, an’ you won’t find it out without hard knocks.”‘What children learns from children,’ she says, ‘is that there’s no sense in grabbin’ at th’ whole orange—peel an’ all.If you do you’ll likely not get even th’ pips, an’ them’s too bitter to eat.’”"
"“她是个精明的女人。”克雷文医生一边穿外套一边说。","“She’s a shrewd woman,” said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat."
"“啊，她说话自有一套，”梅德洛克太太高兴地总结道，“有时候我会对她说，‘啊！苏珊，如果你是别的女人，约克郡口音不那么重，很多时候我就得说你聪明了。’”","“Well, she’s got a way of saying things,” ended Mrs. Medlock, much pleased.“Sometimes I’ve said to her, ‘Eh!Susan, if you was a different woman an’ didn’t talk such broad Yorkshire I’ve seen the times when I should have said you was clever.’”"
"那天晚上科林睡着之后一次也没醒过，早晨他睁开眼睛后，就静静地躺着，而且不知不觉微笑起来——因为他觉得出奇地舒服。醒来的感觉真的很好，他翻了个身，舒舒服服地伸展了一下四肢。他觉得那些紧紧绑着他的线仿佛自己松开了，把他放了。他不知道克雷文医生原本会说，他的神经放松了，得到了休息。他不再躺着盯住墙壁企望自己没醒来过，现在他满脑子都是昨天他和玛丽定下的计划，都是花园的画面，还有迪肯和他的野生动物们。有事可想真好。他醒来不到十分钟，就听到走廊里有人跑过来，然后玛丽就出现在了门口。紧接着，她进了房间，跑到他床前，带来了一股清新的空气，那空气里充满了清晨的芬芳。","That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened his eyes in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it—smiled because he felt so curiously comfortable.It was actually nice to be awake, and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously.He felt as if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and let him go.He did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his nerves had relaxed and rested themselves.Instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of the plans he and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon and his wild creatures.It was so nice to have things to think about.And he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet running along the corridor and Mary was at the door.The next minute she was in the room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a waft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning."
"“你出去过了！你出去过了！有好闻的树叶味道！”他叫道。","“You’ve been out!You’ve been out!There’s that nice smell of leaves!” he cried."
"她一直在跑，头发都松了，被吹乱了，新鲜空气让她气色很好，双颊红润，虽然科林没看到。","She had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was bright with the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it."
"“太漂亮了！”她说道，因为跑得太快，她有点上气不接下气，“你从没见过那么漂亮的东西！它来了！有一天早晨我以为它已经来了，但是，它现在才刚来！这会儿它已经到这里了！它来了，春天来了！迪肯说的！”","“It’s so beautiful!” she said, a little breathless with her speed.“You never saw anything so beautiful!It has come!I thought it had come that other morning, but it was only coming.It is here now!It has come, the Spring!Dickon says so!”"
"“来了吗？”科林叫道。虽然他对春天一无所知，但他还是感觉到自己的心在跳。他从床上坐了起来。","“Has it?” cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing about it he felt his heart beat.He actually sat up in bed."
"“打开窗！”他补充着，半因欢欣雀跃半因自己的想像而笑了起来，“也许我们还能听到金喇叭声呢！”","“Open the window!” he added, laughing half with joyful excitement and half at his own fancy.“Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!”"
"他笑的当儿，玛丽一会儿就来到了窗口，窗户即刻大开，清新、柔和、芬芳的空气和鸟儿的鸣唱一拥而入。","And though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in a moment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds’ songs were pouring through."
"“那是新鲜空气，”玛丽说，“你仰面躺着，做几次深呼吸吧。迪肯躺在原野上的时候就是这么做的。他说他觉得新鲜空气融入了他的血脉，让他变强壮，他觉得自己可以一直活到永远永远。多吸几口气吧。”","“That’s fresh air,” she said.“Lie on your back and draw in long breaths of it.That’s what Dickon does when he’s lying on the moor.He says he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as if he could live forever and ever.Breathe it and breathe it.”"
"她只是在重复迪肯对她说的话，但她所说的正和科林的心意。","She was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she caught Colin’s fancy."
"“永远永远！他这样觉得吗？”他说。接着他按玛丽说的做了，一遍又一遍地做深呼吸，直到一种新鲜愉悦的感觉来临。","“‘Forever and ever’!Does it make him feel like that?” he said, and he did as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over again until he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to him."
"玛丽又来到了他床边。","Mary was at his bedside again."
"“地下正有新生命冒出来，”她急匆匆地一口气说下去，“花瓣正在舒展，到处都有嫩芽，灰色差不多全被绿色的轻纱盖住了，鸟儿都忙着筑巢，就怕来不及，有些甚至为了争秘密花园的地盘而打起来了。玫瑰丛看着要多灵有多灵，小路上和树林里还有樱草花，我们种下的种子发芽了，迪肯还带来了狐狸、乌鸦、松鼠还有一只新生的羊羔。”","“Things are crowding up out of the earth,” she ran on in a hurry.“And there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret garden.And the rose-bushes look as wick as wick can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods, and the seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new-born lamb.”"
"接着她停下来喘了口气。那只新生羊羔是迪肯三天前在原野上的金雀花丛里发现的，那时它正躺在死去的妈妈的身边。这已经不是迪肯第一次发现丧母的羊羔了，他知道应该怎么照顾它。他把羊羔裹在外套里带回了农舍，让它躺在火边，又用热牛奶喂它。它是个软绵绵的小东西，有一张可爱懵懂的小脸，它的腿相对于身体来说相当长。迪肯抱着它穿过原野，它的奶瓶和一只松鼠一起放在他口袋里，玛丽坐在树下，那头羊羔便蜷在她腿上，柔软温暖，玛丽觉得内心充满奇妙的喜悦，说不出话来。一头羊羔——一头羊羔！一头活生生的羊羔，像个婴儿一样躺在你的腿上！","And then she paused for breath.The new-born lamb Dickon had found three days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor.It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to do with it.He had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk.It was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body.Dickon had carried it over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak.A lamb—a lamb!A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!"
"她满怀喜悦地诉说着，科林一边听着一边大口地吸着空气，这时护士进来了。看到窗子开着，她略略一惊。好多次天气暖和的时候，她都坐在这闷闭的屋里，因为她的病人一口咬定开窗会让人着凉。","She was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and drawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered.She started a little at the sight of the open window.She had sat stifling in the room many a warm day because her patient was sure that open windows gave people cold."
"“你确定自己不冷吗，科林少爷？”她问道。","“Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?” she inquired."
"“不冷，”他回答道，“我正大口呼吸新鲜空气。它会让人变强壮。我打算起来到沙发上吃早餐。我表妹和我一起吃。”","“No,” was the answer.“I am breathing long breaths of fresh air.It makes you strong.I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast.My cousin will have breakfast with me.”"
"护士暗自微笑着走开了，去吩咐准备两份早饭。她觉得佣人的大厅比病人的房间更有意思，刚才人人都想听听楼上的新鲜事儿。关于那个不招人喜欢的小隐士的笑话有很多，正如厨师所说，他“找到了他的主人，这对他有好处”。佣人大厅对他那一次次的发作已经不胜其烦，那个拖家带口的仆役长已经不止一次地痛陈自己的意见，说那个病人还是“痛打一顿”的好。","The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for two breakfasts.She found the servants’ hall a more amusing place than the invalid’s chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs.There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse who, as the cook said, “had found his master, and good for him.”The servants’ hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the butler, who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his opinion that the invalid would be all the better “for a good hiding.”"
"科林坐在沙发上，两人的早餐也摆在了桌上，他摆出了最像王爷的架势，给护士下了个命令。","When Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the table he made an announcement to the nurse in his most Rajah-like manner."
"“一个男孩，一只狐狸，一只乌鸦，两只松鼠，还有一头新生的羊羔今天早上要来看我。他们来了就马上把他们带上楼，”他说，“不准你们把那些动物留在佣人的大厅里和它们玩。我要它们到这里来。”护士吸了口气，又试图用咳嗽掩盖住。","“A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb, are coming to see me this morning.I want them brought upstairs as soon as they come,” he said.“You are not to begin playing with the animals in the servants’ hall and keep them there.I want them here.”The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough."
"“好的，先生。”她回答。","“Yes, sir,” she answered."
"“我会告诉你要做什么，”科林挥挥手补充道，“你可以让玛莎带他们过来。那个男孩是玛莎的弟弟。他叫迪肯，是个驯兽师。”","“I’ll tell you what you can do,” added Colin, waving his hand.“You can tell Martha to bring them here.The boy is Martha’s brother.His name is Dickon and he is an animal charmer.”"
"“希望那些动物不会咬人，科林少爷。”护士说。","“I hope the animals won’t bite, Master Colin,” said the nurse."
"“我告诉过你迪肯是个驯兽师，”科林严肃地说，“驯兽师的动物从不会咬人。”","“I told you he was a charmer,” said Colin austerely.“Charmers’ animals never bite.”"
"“印度有耍蛇人，”玛丽说，“他们可以把蛇的头放到嘴里去。”","“There are snake-charmers in India,” said Mary.“And they can put their snakes’ heads in their mouths.”"
"“天哪！”护士瑟瑟发抖。","“Goodness!” shuddered the nurse."
"他们在晨风轻拂中享用了早餐。科林早饭吃得很好，玛丽饶有兴趣地注视着他。","They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.Colin’s breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him with serious interest."
"“你会像我一样胖起来的，”她说，“在印度的时候我从来都不想吃早餐，但现在我一直想吃。”","“You will begin to get fatter just as I did,” she said.“I never wanted my breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.”"
"“今天早晨我也想吃。”科林说，“也许是因为有新鲜空气。你觉得迪肯什么时候会来？”","“I wanted mine this morning,” said Colin.“Perhaps it was the fresh air.When do you think Dickon will come?”"
"他快要来了。十分钟后，玛丽举起了手。","He was not long in coming.In about ten minutes Mary held up her hand."
"“听！”她说，“你听到乌鸦叫了么？”","“Listen!” she said.“Did you hear a caw?”"
"科林侧耳倾听，也听到了，那是在室内所能听到的最奇特的声音，沙哑的“哇——哇”声。","Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hear inside a house, a hoarse “caw-caw.”"
"“是的。”他回答。","“Yes,” he answered."
"“那是煤烟，”玛丽说，“再听。你听到羊的叫声了么——很轻的？”","“That’s Soot,” said Mary.“Listen again. Do you hear a bleat—a tiny one?”"
"“啊，是的！”科林涨红了脸叫道。","“Oh, yes!” cried Colin, quite flushing."
"“那就是新生羊羔，”玛丽说，“他来了。”","“That’s the new-born lamb,” said Mary. “He’s coming.”"
"迪肯的荒野靴子又厚又笨重，虽然他尽量放轻了脚步，但是穿过走廊的时候还是有啪哒啪哒的声音。玛丽和科林听着他走近——走近，穿过一道有挂毯的门，踏上了科林房间走廊上的柔软的地毯。","Dickon’s moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried to walk quietly they made a clumping sound as he walked through the long corridors.Mary and Colin heard him marching—marching, until he passed through the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin’s own passage."
"“如果您愿意，先生，”玛莎一边开门一边说，“如果您愿意，先生，迪肯和他的动物们来了。”","“If you please, sir,” announced Martha, opening the door, “if you please, sir, here’s Dickon an’ his creatures.”"
"迪肯走了进来，带着他最灿烂的微笑。他怀里抱着那只新生的羊羔，红色小狐狸在他身边跑跳着。坚果坐在他左肩上，煤烟在右肩上，果壳的脑袋和爪子从他的衣服口袋里探出来。","Dickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile.The new-born lamb was in his arms and the little red fox trotted by his side.Nut sat on his left shoulder and Soot on his right and Shell’s head and paws peeped out of his coat pocket."
"科林慢慢地坐起来，不停地打量着——就像他第一次见玛丽那样打量着；但这次是好奇而高兴的眼神。实际上，虽然他已经听说了很多，但他还是丝毫不清楚这个男孩会是什么样的，他的狐狸、乌鸦、松鼠和羊羔都和他那样亲近，他友好亲切，那些动物几乎都要变成他的一部分了。科林这辈子还从来没和一个男孩说过话，快乐和好奇把他淹没了，他甚至忘了开口。","Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared—as he had stared when he first saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight.The truth was that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least understood what this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow and his squirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness that they seemed almost to be part of himself.Colin had never talked to a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure and curiosity that he did not even think of speaking."
"但是迪肯没有觉得丝毫害羞和不自在。他不觉得尴尬，是因为他第一次见到乌鸦时，乌鸦不懂他的语言，只是瞪着他不说话。小动物总是那样，直到它们了解了你。他走到科林的沙发前，轻轻地把新生羊羔放在他腿上，小家伙立刻转向温暖的丝绒晨衣，并开始用鼻子往衣服叠层里拱啊拱，满是卷毛的脑袋在科林身侧顶着，轻柔却又不耐烦。当然，这个时候，没有哪个男孩能忍住不说话。","But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward.He had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had only stared and had not spoken to him the first time they met.Creatures were always like that until they found out about you.He walked over to Colin’s sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his lap, and immediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gown and began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curled head with soft impatience against his side.Of course no boy could have helped speaking then."
"“它在干什么？”科林叫道，“它想要什么啊？”","“What is it doing?” cried Colin.“What does it want?”"
"“它要妈妈，”迪肯说着，笑容越来越灿烂，“我是在它有点饿的时候带它来见你的，因为我知道你会想看它吃东西的。”","“It wants its mother,” said Dickon, smiling more and more.“I brought it to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha’d like to see it feed.”"
"他在沙发旁跪下来，从口袋里拿出一个奶瓶。","He knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his pocket."
"“过来，小家伙，”他边说边用一只棕褐色的手将那个毛茸茸的白色小脑袋轻轻掰转过来，“这就是内想要的。这儿的好吃的可比丝绒袍子上的多得多。这就对啦。”他把瓶子上的橡皮头塞到它蠕动的嘴里，那羊羔就开始贪婪地吮吸起来。","“Come on, little ‘un,” he said, turning the small woolly white head with a gentle brown hand.“This is what tha’s after.Tha’ll get more out o’ this than tha’ will out o’ silk velvet coats.There now,” and he pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy."
"之后就不必刻意去想该说什么了。羊羔睡着后，他们的疑问一涌而出，迪肯一一回答了。他告诉他们，三天前，太阳升起来的时候，他是如何发现这羊羔的。那时他正站在原野上听云雀的歌声，看着它盘旋升空越飞越高，直到它变成高远碧空中的一个小点。","After that there was no wondering what to say.By the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all.He told them how he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago.He had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching him swing higher and higher into the sky until he was only a speck in the heights of blue."
"“除了它的歌声，我就找不到其它踪迹了，我寻思着它眼看就要飞出这个世界了，人怎么还能听见它的歌声——这时，我听到另一个声音从金雀花丛中传来。那是一声微弱的羊叫，我知道那是头新生羊羔，它饿了，我也知道，要不是因为没了妈妈，它是不会这么饿的，所以我就开始了搜寻。唉！还真难找。我在金雀花丛里进进出出，转来转去，好像总是转错了方向。但是，最后，在原野顶上的岩石旁边，我看到了一点白色，于是我向上爬去，就看到了这小家伙，那时它又冷又饿，已经半死不活了。”他说话时，煤烟正儿八经地从开着的窗户里飞进飞出，还叫唤几声作为对景色的评论，坚果和果壳到外面的大树上去履行，它们沿着树干窜上窜下，还对树枝探索了一番。迪肯习惯性地坐在了炉前的地毯上，船长蜷在他身边。","“I’d almost lost him but for his song an’ I was wonderin’ how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he’d get out o’ th’ world in a minute—an’ just then I heard somethin’ else far off among th’ gorse bushes.It was a weak bleatin’ an’ I knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an’ I knowed it wouldn’t be hungry if it hadn’t lost its mother somehow, so I set off searchin’.Eh!I did have a look for it.I went in an’ out among th’ gorse bushes an’ round an’ round an’ I always seemed to take th’ wrong turnin’.But at last I seed a bit o’ white by a rock on top o’ th’ moor an’ I climbed up an’ found th’ little ‘un half dead wi’ cold an’ clemmin’.”While he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and cawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions into the big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches.Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from preference."
"他们一起欣赏园艺书里的插图，迪肯知道所有花的俗名，还准确地知道哪种花已经在秘密花园生长了。","They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew all the flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were already growing in the secret garden."
"“我叫不出那种植物的名字，”迪肯指着一种植物说，它的插图下标着“耧斗菜属”，“我们管它叫耧斗菜，那边的是金鱼草，它们是野生的，长在篱笆上，但书上这个是花园里种的，所以要大一些，漂亮一些。花园里有好些大丛的耧斗菜。它们开花的时候，就像满满一花床的蓝色和白色蝴蝶，扑扇着翅膀。”","“I couldna’ say that there name,” he said, pointing to one under which was written “Aquilegia,” “but us calls that a columbine, an’ that there one it’s a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these is garden ones an’ they’re bigger an’ grander.There’s some big clumps o’ columbine in th’ garden.They’ll look like a bed o’ blue an’ white butterflies flutterin’ when they’re out.”"
"“我要去瞧瞧，”科林叫道，“我要去瞧瞧！”","“I’m going to see them,” cried Colin.“I am going to see them!”"
"“是啊，内一定要去，”玛丽严肃地说，“内角对不能浪费时间。”","“Aye, that tha’ mun,” said Mary quite seriously.“An’ tha’ munnot lose no time about it.”"
"第二十章 “我会活到永远——永远——永远！”","CHAPTER XX “I SHALL LIVE FOREVER—AND EVER—AND EVER!”"
"但是他们被迫等了一个多礼拜，因为先是几天大风，后来科林又得了感冒，这两件接连发生的事情无疑让科林大为恼火，但好在有很多细致神秘的计划要去执行，而且迪肯几乎每天都来讲原野上、小径上、篱笆上和小溪边发生的事，哪怕只有几分钟。他讲了水獭、獾子和水鼠的家，更别提鸟巢、田鼠和田鼠洞了，当你从一个驯兽师那里听到这些深入的细节，并意识到整个地下世界正带着怎样的激情和热切忙碌工作的时候，这一切都足以让你兴奋得发抖。","But they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came some very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which two things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him into a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes, to talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams.The things he had to tell about otters’ and badgers’ and water-rats’ houses, not to mention birds’ nests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the whole busy underworld was working."
"“它们和我们是一样的，”迪肯说，“唯一不同的就是，他们每年都要建造自己的房子。所以他们很忙，总是要手忙脚乱才能干完活儿。”","“They’re same as us,” said Dickon, “only they have to build their homes every year.An’ it keeps ’em so busy they fair scuffle to get ’em done.”"
"为了确保能足够保密地把科林送到花园，他们需要做一些准备工作，这才是最吸引人的。他们会在灌木丛的某处转个弯，来到爬满常春藤的墙外的走道上，这之后就不能让任何人看到轮椅、迪肯和玛丽了。一天天过去了，科林越来越强烈地感觉到，花园的神秘感是它最大的魅力之一。不能让任何东西破坏它。不能让任何人疑心他们有个秘密。必须让别人认为他和玛丽还有迪肯一起出去，只是因为他喜欢他们，不反对他们看着他。他们对路线问题进行过愉快的长谈。他们要沿这条路过去，再沿那条路过来，再穿过另一条，然后在喷泉花坛里兜圈子，假装观赏主管园丁罗奇先生一手打理的“移栽植物”。那个举动合情合理，没人会觉得有什么神秘可言。然后他们就转入灌木丛中的走道，淹没其中，直到他们来到长墙那里。这一切就像战争年代的大将军制定出来的行军计划一样严密、深思熟虑。","The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made before Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden.No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls.As each day passed, Colin had become more and more fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms.Nothing must spoil that.No one must ever suspect that they had a secret.People must think that he was simply going out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object to their looking at him.They had long and quite delightful talks about their route.They would go up this path and down that one and cross the other and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking at the “bedding-out plants” the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been having arranged.That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one would think it at all mysterious.They would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls.It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of war."
"病人房里发生了新奇的事情，这消息理所当然从佣人大厅传到了马厩院子里，接着又外传到了花匠之间，但尽管如此，罗奇先生某天接到科林少爷房里传来的命令时仍然吃了一惊，那道命令大致是要他去那个外人从没去过的房间里报到，因为那个病人有话要亲自对他说。","Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the invalid’s apartments had of course filtered through the servants’ hall into the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding this, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from Master Colin’s room to the effect that he must report himself in the apartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak to him."
"“啊，啊，”他一边匆匆忙忙地换衣服一边自言自语道，“现在怎么办呢？那个不准人看他一眼的殿下要召见一个自己从没正眼瞧过的人。”","“Well, well,” he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat, “what’s to do now?His Royal Highness that wasn’t to be looked at calling up a man he’s never set eyes on.”"
"罗奇先生也不是没有好奇心。他从没见过那男孩一眼，夸张的故事倒听了一打，都是关于关于他神秘的样子、行事方式和疯疯癫癫的脾气的。最常听说的就是他随时都有可能死去，还有许多稀奇古怪的传言，说他是个驼背，四肢无力，而这些都是从未见过他的人说出来的。","Mr. Roach was not without curiosity.He had never caught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways and his insane tempers.The thing he had heard oftenest was that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by people who had never seen him."
"“这房里的情况变了，罗奇先生。”梅德洛克太太边说边领着他从后面楼梯上了走廊，一直朝至今为止依然神秘的房间走去。","“Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,” said Mrs. Medlock, as she led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened the hitherto mysterious chamber."
"“希望情况正往好的方向变，梅德洛克太太。”他回答说。","“Let’s hope they’re changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,” he answered."
"“要往坏里变可就没有余地了，”她继续说，“还真奇怪，他们觉得承担责任变得容易多了。罗奇先生，要是等会儿你发觉自己置身一群动物中间，而玛莎•索尔比家的迪肯比你我都要自在，你可别吃惊啊。”","“They couldn’t well change for the worse,” she continued; “and queer as it all is there’s them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand up under.Don’t you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in the middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby’s Dickon more at home than you or me could ever be.”"
"就像玛丽私下里一贯相信的那样，迪肯确实有一种魔力。罗奇先生听到他的名字后温和地笑了。　","There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately believed.When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently."
"“就是在白金汉宫或者是煤矿底下他也一样自在。”他说，“他也不是狂妄无礼。那孩子就是自在。”","“He’d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,” he said.“And yet it’s not impudence, either.He’s just fine, is that lad.”"
"好在他有了思想准备，否则他会被吓一跳。卧室的门打开了，一只大乌鸦相当自在地停在雕花椅子的高靠背上，用响亮的“哇——哇”声宣布客人的到来。尽管梅德洛克太太提醒过，罗奇先生还是险些就要大失体面地往后跳去。","It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled.When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance of a visitor by saying “Caw—Caw” quite loudly.In spite of Mrs. Medlock’s warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward."
"那年轻的王爷既不在床上，也不在沙发上。他正坐在扶手椅子里，身旁站着一头小羊羔，它用吃奶时惯用的方式摇着尾巴，迪肯则跪着用奶瓶给它喂奶。一只松鼠站在迪肯俯下来的背上，正专心致志地啃着一颗坚果。那个印度来的小女孩则坐在一个大脚凳上看着。","The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa.He was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in feeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle.A squirrel was perched on Dickon’s bent back attentively nibbling a nut.The little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on."
"“这是罗奇先生，科林少爷。”梅德洛克太太说。　　年轻的王爷转了过来，将自己的仆人打量了一番——至少园丁主管是这么觉得的。　　“噢，你就是罗奇，对吗？”他说，“我派人找你来，是要嘱咐你一些非常重要的事。”","“Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,” said Mrs. Medlock.The young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over—at least that was what the head gardener felt happened.“Oh, you are Roach, are you?” he said.“I sent for you to give you some very important orders.”"
"“好的，先生。”罗奇一边回答一边琢磨着自己是否会接到命令去砍掉园子里所有的橡树，或者把果园改成水景花园。","“Very good, sir,” answered Roach, wondering if he was to receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the orchards into water-gardens."
"“今天下午我要坐轮椅出去，”科林说，“如果我能适应新鲜空气，那我可能每天都会出去。我出门时，所有花匠都不准靠近花园墙边的长廊。任何人都不准靠近。我大概两点钟出门，所有人都要回避，直到我发话允许他们回来干活儿。”","“I am going out in my chair this afternoon,” said Colin.“If the fresh air agrees with me I may go out every day.When I go, none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls.No one is to be there.I shall go out about two o’clock and everyone must keep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.”"
"“好的，先生。”罗奇先生回答。得知可以保住橡树，果园也安全，他放心多了。“玛丽，”科林转向她，说道，“你在印度的时候，讲完话想让人走了，你是怎么说的？”","“Very good, sir,” replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the oaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.“Mary,” said Colin, turning to her, “what is that thing you say in India when you have finished talking and want people to go?”"
"“你要说，‘你获准可以离开了。’”玛丽回答。","“You say, ‘You have my permission to go,’” answered Mary."
"王爷挥了挥手。","The Rajah waved his hand."
"“你获准可以离开了，罗奇，”他说，“但是，记住，这很重要。”","“You have my permission to go, Roach,” he said.“But, remember, this is very important.”"
"“哇——哇！”乌鸦沙哑却又不失礼貌地发表了评论。","“Caw—Caw!” remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely."
"“好的，先生。谢谢您，先生。”罗奇说完，梅德洛克太太把他领出了房间。","“Very good, sir. Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock took him out of the room."
"罗奇先生是个脾气很好的人，他站在外面的走廊上微笑起来，直到笑出了声。","Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he smiled until he almost laughed."
"“天哪！”他说，“他可真是派头十足啊，不是么？你会以为整个皇室在他身上合而为一了呢——亲王加上所有其他人。”","“My word!” he said, “he’s got a fine lordly way with him, hasn’t he?You’d think he was a whole Royal Family rolled into one—Prince Consort and all.”."
"“啊！”梅德洛克太太抗议道，“自从他长了脚，我们每个人就不得不任由他践踏，他以为别人生来就是干这个的。”","“Eh!” protested Mrs. Medlock, “we’ve had to let him trample all over every one of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that’s what folks was born for.”"
"“也许他长大了就会厌倦了，如果他能活下来的话。”罗奇先生说。","“Perhaps he’ll grow out of it, if he lives,” suggested Mr. Roach."
"“嗯，有一件事是肯定的，”梅德洛克太太说，“如果他能活下去，而那个印度孩子也呆在这里的话，我保证她会教会他整个桔子不是只属于他一个人的，正如苏珊•索尔比说的那样。他会知道自己的地盘到底有多大。”","“Well, there’s one thing pretty sure,” said Mrs. Medlock.“If he does live and that Indian child stays here I’ll warrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says.And he’ll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter.”"
"房间里，科林正靠在他的靠垫上。","Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions."
"“一切都安全了，”他说，“今天下午就能看到它了——今天下午我就能进去了！”","“It’s all safe now,” he said.“And this afternoon I shall see it—this afternoon I shall be in it!”"
"迪肯带着动物们回花园了，玛丽则和科林呆在一起。她觉得科林看上去不像是累了，但午饭之前他都很安静，而且吃饭的时候他也很安静。她想知道原因，于是便问了科林。","Dickon went back to the garden with his creatures and Mary stayed with Colin.She did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet before their lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it.She wondered why and asked him about it."
"“你的眼睛好大啊，科林，”她说，“你想问题的时候眼睛睁得像碟子一样大。你现在在想什么呢？”","“What big eyes you’ve got, Colin,” she said.“When you are thinking they get as big as saucers.What are you thinking about now?”"
"“我控制不住要去想它的样子。”他回答说。","“I can’t help thinking about what it will look like,” he answered."
" “花园？”玛丽问道。","“The garden?” asked Mary."
"“春天，”他说，“我正在想，之前我从没真正见过春天。我极少出门，即使出门，也很少观察。我甚至想都没想过。”","“The springtime,” he said.“I was thinking that I’ve really never seen it before.I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked at it.I didn’t even think about it.”"
"“我在印度时也没见过，因为那里没有春天。”玛丽说。","“I never saw it in India because there wasn’t any,” said Mary."
"科林的生活一直在幽闭的病塌上度过，所以他的想象力比玛丽更丰富，至少他用了大量的时间来看精彩的书和图画。","Shut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin had more imagination than she had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking at wonderful books and pictures."
"“那天早晨你跑进来说‘它来了！ 它来了！’，你让我有种非常奇怪的感觉。听上去就好像什么东西正排着队挺进，伴着时而迸发时而飘扬的音乐。我的一本书里就有这样的一幅图——可爱的大人小孩成群结队，身上点缀着花环和开花的枝条，每个人都笑啊，跳啊，挤在一起，还会奏乐。那就是为什么我会说‘也许我们能听见金喇叭的声音’，还让你打开窗。”","“That morning when you ran in and said ‘It’s come!It’s come!’, you made me feel quite queer.It sounded as if things were coming with a great procession and big bursts and wafts of music.I’ve a picture like it in one of my books—crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes.That was why I said, ‘Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets’ and told you to throw open the window.”"
"“真有意思！”玛丽说，“感觉还真是那样的。要是所有花朵、叶子、绿色植物、小鸟和野生动物都同时跳着舞经过，那该是个多么庞大的群体啊！我确定它们会唱歌、吹笛子，飘扬的音乐就是这么来的。”","“How funny!” said Mary.“That’s really just what it feels like.And if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once, what a crowd it would be!I’m sure they’d dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.”"
"他们都笑起来，不是因为这个念头可笑，而是因为他们都喜欢这个念头。","They both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable but because they both so liked it."
"过了一会儿，护士为科林打点好了一切。她注意到，帮科林穿衣服的时候，他不再像截木头一样躺着不动，而是坐了起来，试图自己穿衣，还一直和玛丽有说有笑。","A little later the nurse made Colin ready.She noticed that instead of lying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made some efforts to help himself, and he talked and laughed with Mary all the time."
"“今天他状态不错，先生，”她对顺路来为他做检查的克雷文医生说，“他情绪很好，所以变得强壮些了。”","“This is one of his good days, sir,” she said to Dr. Craven, who dropped in to inspect him.“He’s in such good spirits that it makes him stronger.”"
"“下午晚些时候，等他回来了，我再来拜访。”克雷文医生说。“我得看看他是不是适合外出。我希望，”他压低了声音，“他会让你和他一起去。”","“I’ll call in again later in the afternoon, after he has come in,” said Dr. Craven.“I must see how the going out agrees with him.I wish,” in a very low voice, “that he would let you go with him.”"
"“先生，我宁愿现在就放弃这差事，也不想在这儿等人让我去做。”护士突然坚定地回答。“我没有真的打算让你去做，”医生稍微有点紧张地说，“我们来试试看吧。迪肯这孩子，就是把新生婴儿交给他我也放心。”","“I’d rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here while it’s suggested,” answered the nurse, with sudden firmness.“I hadn’t really decided to suggest it,” said the doctor, with his slight nervousness.“We’ll try the experiment.Dickon’s a lad I’d trust with a new-born child.”"
"家里最强壮的脚夫把科林抱下楼，放在门外的轮椅里，迪肯在轮椅旁等着。男仆把科林的毯子垫子都准备妥当后，王爷冲他和护士挥了挥手。","The strongest footman in the house carried Colin down stairs and put him in his wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside.After the manservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his hand to him and to the nurse."
"“你们获准可以离开了。”他一说完，他们就迅速消失了，坦白说，到达房子里的安全地带后，他们都咯咯地笑起来。","“You have my permission to go,” he said, and they both disappeared quickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely inside the house."
"迪肯开始慢慢地稳稳当当地推起了轮椅。玛丽小姐走在旁边，科林向后靠着，对着天空仰起了脸。苍穹十分高远，雪白的小片云朵像白色的鸟儿一样，在水晶般的碧空里展翅飞翔。阵阵和风从原野上吹来，带着野外那奇妙清新的芳香。科林挺起瘦弱的胸膛，不断地吸着新鲜空气，他正听着听着，用的是却他那双大眼睛，而不是耳朵。","Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily.Mistress Mary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his face to the sky.The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness.Colin kept lifting his thin chest to draw it in, and his big eyes looked as if it were they which were listening—listening, instead of his ears."
"“歌声、嗡嗡声和叫唤声可真多呀，”他说，“那一阵阵风带来的香气是什么？”","“There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,” he said.“What is that scent the puffs of wind bring?”"
"“是原野上正在开放的金雀花，”迪肯回答，“啊！今天有好多蜜蜂呢。”","“It’s gorse on th’ moor that’s openin’ out,” answered Dickon.“Eh! th’ bees are at it wonderful today.”"
"他们走的那条小路上一个人也没有。实际上，所有花匠和花匠的孩子都被法术弄走了。但他们还是依照详细计划好的路线在灌木丛里进进出出，在喷泉花坛里兜圈子，只为了享受那种神秘的乐趣。当他们最终来到常春藤墙外的长廊时，渐渐逼近的震颤感让他们激动万分，出于某种神秘的无法解释的原因，他们开始低声私语。","Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took.In fact every gardener or gardener’s lad had been witched away.But they wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere mysterious pleasure of it.But when at last they turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them, for some curious reason they could not have explained, begin to speak in whispers."
"“就是这儿，”玛丽轻声说，“我就是经常在这里走来走去，猜来猜去的。”“就是这儿？”科林叫起来，他开始带着热切的好奇心用眼睛在常春藤上搜寻。“可我什么都看不出来啊，”他小声道，“没有门啊。”","“This is it,” breathed Mary.“This is where I used to walk up and down and wonder and wonder.”“Is it?” cried Colin, and his eyes began to search the ivy with eager curiousness.“But I can see nothing,” he whispered.“There is no door.”"
"“我也曾这样想。”玛丽说。","“That’s what I thought,” said Mary."
"接着是一阵恰到好处的沉默，他们屏住了呼吸，轮椅继续转动前行。","Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on."
"“本•韦瑟斯塔夫就是在这个花园里干活儿的。”玛丽说。","“That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,” said Mary."
"“是吗？”科林说道。","“Is it?” said Colin."
"又走了一段距离，玛丽继续低声说话。","A few yards more and Mary whispered again."
"“知更鸟就是从这儿的墙上面飞过去的。”她说。","“This is where the robin flew over the wall,” she said."
"“是吗？”科林叫道，“噢！真希望它可以再来！”","“Is it?” cried Colin. “Oh! I wish he’d come again!”"
"“还有那里，”玛丽郑重又愉快地指着一大丛紫丁香花说，“它就停在那里的小土堆上，把钥匙指给我看。”","“And that,” said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilac bush, “is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me the key.”"
"科林坐了起来。","Then Colin sat up."
"“哪里？哪里？是那里吗？”他叫道。他的眼睛像《小红帽》里的狼一样大，大得让小红帽禁不住要评论一番。迪肯停住了脚步，轮椅也停了下来。","“Where? Where? There?” he cried, and his eyes were as big as the wolf’s in Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark on them.Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped."
"“还有这里，”玛丽一边说一边踏上常春藤旁边的花床，“我就是在这里和它说话的，那时它正站在墙顶上冲我喳喳地叫。这就是被风吹开的常春藤。”玛丽说着便拉开了悬挂着的绿色帘幕。","“And this,” said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, “is where I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the wall.And this is the ivy the wind blew back,” and she took hold of the hanging green curtain."
"“噢！果然——果然！”科林喘着气。","“Oh! is it—is it!” gasped Colin."
"“门把手在这里，这就是门。迪肯，推他进去——快推他进去！”","“And here is the handle, and here is the door.Dickon push him in—push him in quickly!”"
"迪肯这一推推得漂亮、有力而稳当。","And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push."
"但科林还是跌回了他的靠垫上，尽管如此，他还是高兴得直喘气，并用手蒙住了眼睛，而且一直保持着这个姿势，把一切都挡在视线之外，直到他们进了花园，轮椅像被施了魔法般地停了下来，门也关上了。这时他才把手移开，一遍又一遍地环顾四周，就像当初迪肯和玛丽所做的一样。墙上、地上、树上、摇摆着的枝条和卷须上，都爬满了嫩叶织就的美丽绿纱，树下的草丛里，壁龛里的灰罐上，这里那里到处都是星星点点的金色、紫色和白色，树顶上是片片粉红和雪白，伴着翅膀的扇动声，隐约甜美的管乐声，翁鸣声，还有阵阵馥郁的馨香。阳光洒在他脸上，暖洋洋的，像一只手温柔地触到了他。玛丽和迪肯站在那儿惊奇地看着他。他看上去非常奇怪，因为一抹粉色的光正爬上他全身——爬上他象牙色的面颊、脖颈、双手直至全身。","But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though he gasped with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and held them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed.Not till then did he take them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary had done.And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents.And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch.And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him.He looked so strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over him—ivory face and neck and hands and all."
"“我会好起来的！ 我会好起来的！”他叫了出来，“玛丽！迪肯！我会好起来的！我会活到永远永远永远！”","“I shall get well!I shall get well!” he cried out.“Mary! Dickon! I shall get well!And I shall live forever and ever and ever!”"
"第二十一章 本•韦瑟斯塔夫","CHAPTER XXI BEN WEATHERSTAFF"
"活在世上，怪事之一就是，人只有在某些时候才能确信自己可以活到永远永远永远。在某些时候，你就会明白。你在温柔庄严的黎明时分起身，来到户外孑然而立，高高仰起头向上望去，眼见着苍天渐渐变幻，泛红，不同寻常的未知事件呼之欲出，直到东方的景象让你几欲惊呼出声，连心都静止下来，为的就是日出时分那奇异的永恒的庄严——这一幕每天早晨都会发生，延续了千千万万个年头。那一刹那，你明白了。还有些时候，你也会明白。日落时分，你独自站在林间，神秘金晖沉静地斜穿过树枝投到树下，仿佛正悠悠轻语，一遍又一遍，却又听不真切，不管你做了多少次尝试。另有些时候，夜晚一片墨蓝，静谧无边，千万颗星星正在等待着，凝视着，这便让你确信了；有时是远方一阵乐声让它变得真切；有时是某个人的一个眼神。","One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever.One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one’s head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one’s heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun—which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.One knows it then for a moment or so.And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries.Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in some one’s eyes."
"当科林第一次看到、听到并感受到秘密花园那四面高墙之内的春天时，他的感觉就是这样的。那天下午，整个世界都好像要倾其全力在一个男孩面前显得尽善尽美，明丽动人，温和友善。也许纯粹是出于天然的好意，春天来到这里，并尽其所能把一切都倾注到这一个地方。迪肯不止一次地停下手中的活儿，静静地站着，轻轻晃着脑袋，眼里的好奇越来越浓。","And it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt the Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden.That afternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful and kind to one boy.Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything it possibly could into that one place.More than once Dickon paused in what he was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head softly."
"“啊！真好，”他说，“我十二岁，快要到十三岁了，十三年里有好多个下午，但我觉得我从没见过哪个下午像今天这样美好。”","“Eh! it is graidely,” he said.“I’m twelve goin’ on thirteen an’ there’s a lot o’ afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I never seed one as graidely as this ‘ere.”"
"“是啊，真是个美好的下午，”玛丽说着，又因纯粹的快乐而吐了口气，“我保证这是世界上最好的一个下午了。”","“Aye, it is a graidely one,” said Mary, and she sighed for mere joy.“I’ll warrant it’s the graidelest one as ever was in this world.”"
"“内觉不觉得，”科林像在梦里一般小心翼翼地说，“这一气都祥是特意为了我安排的呢？”","“Does tha’ think,” said Colin with dreamy carefulness, “as happen it was made loike this ‘ere all o’ purpose for me?”"
"“天哪！”玛丽赞许地叫道，“你能说点地道的约克郡话啦。内模仿一流——技术真高超。”","“My word!” cried Mary admiringly, “that there is a bit o’ good Yorkshire.Tha’rt shapin’ first-rate—that tha’ art.”"
"快乐主宰着一切。他们把轮椅拖到李树下，李树已经开花了，一片雪白，蜜蜂在树间创造着音韵。那棵树就像是国王的华盖，童话里的国王。附近还有樱桃树，花朵盛开，苹果树的花蕾粉白相间，随处都有几朵灿然绽放。华盖的枝叶繁花之间是一点青天，像一双妙目俯视着下方。","And delight reigned.They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with blossoms and musical with bees.It was like a king’s canopy, a fairy king’s.There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide.Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes."
"玛丽和迪肯在这儿干点儿活，再到那儿干点儿，科林看着他们。他们把各种东西带给他看——正在绽放的花蕾，紧闭的花苞，一截刚冒出新绿的嫩枝，啄木鸟掉在草地上的羽毛，还有曾经孵出过小鸟的空蛋壳。迪肯慢慢地推着轮椅绕着花园走，时不时停下让科林看看土里冒出来的和树上垂下来的奇迹。这就像是被带进了一个会被魔法的国王和王后统治着的国度，看到了那个国度所蕴藏的所有神秘财富。","Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them.They brought him things to look at—buds which were opening, buds which were tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green, the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty shell of some bird early hatched.Dickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him look at wonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees.It was like being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained."
"“我在想我们能不能看到知更鸟？”科林问。　　“过一段时间你就能经常看到它了，”迪肯回答，“等到蛋孵出来，这小家伙就会忙得晕头转向。你会看到它衔着和它自己差不多大的虫子飞来飞去，它一飞回来，巢里就闹腾开了，他会忙乱得不知道应该先把第一份食物放到哪一张大开的嘴里。每一边的嘴都张得很大，呱呱地叫着。妈妈说，每次她看到知更鸟为了填满那些大开的嘴巴而忙碌，她就觉得自己像个无所事事的夫人。她说她看到过那些小家伙好像都大汗淋漓了，只是人们看不见罢了。”","“I wonder if we shall see the robin?” said Colin.“Tha’ll see him often enow after a bit,” answered Dickon.“When th’ eggs hatches out th’ little chap he’ll be kep’ so busy it’ll make his head swim.Tha’ll see him flyin’ backward an’ for’ard carryin’ worms nigh as big as himsel’ an’ that much noise goin’ on in th’ nest when he gets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to drop th’ first piece in.An’ gapin’ beaks an’ squawks on every side.Mother says as when she sees th’ work a robin has to keep them gapin’ beaks filled, she feels like she was a lady with nothin’ to do.She says she’s seen th’ little chaps when it seemed like th’ sweat must be droppin’ off ‘em, though folk can’t see it.”"
"他们高兴地咯咯笑起来，又记起不能让人听到，便用手捂住了嘴。几天前科林就得知了说话要轻声地规定。他喜欢这规定的神秘感，也尽了最大努力去遵守，但是，一旦兴头上来，就很难压低声音笑了。","This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover their mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard.Colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several days before.He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best, but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper."
"午后的每时每刻都充满新奇，阳光的金色每个钟头都在加深。轮椅被拉回到华盖下，迪肯在草地上坐下，取出笛子，这时，科林看到了先前没空理会的东西。","Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the sunshine grew more golden.The wheeled chair had been drawn back under the canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his pipe when Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before."
"“那里是一棵很老的树吗？”他问。迪肯向草地另一头的树望去，玛丽也望过去，接着是一阵短暂的沉默。","“That’s a very old tree over there, isn’t it?” he said.Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there was a brief moment of stillness."
"“是的。”迪肯说完，低沉的声音里带上了一丝温柔。","“Yes,” answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had a very gentle sound."
"玛丽盯着那棵树陷入了沉思。","Mary gazed at the tree and thought."
"“它的树枝颜色好灰暗，树上一片叶子也没有，”科林继续说，“它已经死了，对吧？”","“The branches are quite gray and there’s not a single leaf anywhere,” Colin went on.“It’s quite dead, isn’t it?”"
"“是啊，”迪肯承认，“但玫瑰会爬满整棵树，等叶子和花长满的时候，死木头就会被盖住。那时它看上去就不像是死的了。 它会变成最漂亮的。”","“Aye,” admitted Dickon.“But them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit o’ th’ dead wood when they’re full o’ leaves an’ flowers.It won’t look dead then.It’ll be th’ prettiest of all.”"
"玛丽仍然在盯着树沉思。","Mary still gazed at the tree and thought."
"“看起来好像是很大的一根树枝折断了，”科林说，“我想知道是怎么弄断的。”","“It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,” said Colin.“I wonder how it was done.”"
"“已经断了很多年了。”迪肯回答。“啊！”他突然把手放到科林身上，欣慰地叫起来，“看知更鸟！它在那儿！它在给它的伴儿找吃的呢。”","“It’s been done many a year,” answered Dickon.“Eh!” with a sudden relieved start and laying his hand on Colin.“Look at that robin!There he is!He’s been foragin’ for his mate.”"
"科林差点儿就迟了一步，不过，他还是看到了，那只红色胸脯的鸟衔着东西一闪而过。它掠过绿荫，飞进角落，没了踪影。科林又靠到了垫子上，面露笑容。“它给它那位送下午茶呢。也许现在已经五点了。 我觉得我也想喝点茶了。”","Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of red-breasted bird with something in his beak.He darted through the greenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight.Colin leaned back on his cushion again, laughing a little.“He’s taking her tea to her.Perhaps it’s five o’clock.I think I’d like some tea myself.”"
"于是，他们安全了。","And so they were safe."
"“是魔法把知更鸟送来的，”事后玛丽悄悄对迪肯说，“我知道是魔法。”因为她和迪肯都怕科林问起那棵十年前断了树枝的大树，他们曾经讨论过这事，那时迪肯便站在那里，烦恼地揉着脑袋。","“It was Magic which sent the robin,” said Mary secretly to Dickon afterward.“I know it was Magic.”For both she and Dickon had been afraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken off ten years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon had stood and rubbed his head in a troubled way."
"“我们要假装没发觉这棵树和别的有什么不同，”他说，“我们永远不能告诉他树枝是怎么折断的，可怜的孩子。 如果他提起来，我们一定要——一定要装得很高兴。”","“We mun look as if it wasn’t no different from th’ other trees,” he had said.“We couldn’t never tell him how it broke, poor lad.If he says anything about it we mun—we mun try to look cheerful.”"
"“是啊，必须这样。”玛丽回答。","“Aye, that we mun,” had answered Mary."
"但是，她不觉得自己盯着那棵树时显得高兴。那时她正反反复复地想着迪肯说的另一件事，不知道那是不是真的。当时他还在迷惑地揉着他那头锈红色的头发，但他的蓝眼睛中开始浮现出欣慰的神色。","But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the tree.She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing Dickon had said.He had gone on rubbing his rust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue eyes."
"“克雷文夫人是个很可爱的年轻女士，”他犹豫着说了下去，“妈妈说，她觉得克雷文夫人可能已经回米瑟韦斯特庄园好多次了，为了照顾科林少爷，就像所有妈妈离开这世界后所做的一样。你瞧，她们必须回来。碰巧她就在花园里，碰巧她让我们干活儿，还告诉我们把科林带来。”","“Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,” he had gone on rather hesitatingly.“An’ mother she thinks maybe she’s about Misselthwaite many a time lookin’ after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when they’re took out o’ th’ world.They have to come back, tha’ sees.Happen she’s been in the garden an’ happen it was her set us to work, an’ told us to bring him here.”"
"玛丽本以为他在说魔法。她很相信魔法。她也暗自相信，迪肯对自己周围的一切都施了法术，当然，是好的法术，这就是为什么大家都那么喜欢他，野生动物们也把他当朋友。实际上她在想，就在科林提出那惊险的问题的关头，是不是迪肯的魔力把知更鸟适时地招来了。她觉得整个下午他的魔法都在起作用，让科林像变了个人似的。他看上去一点都不像那个会尖叫着拍打并撕咬枕头的疯狂家伙了。就连他那象牙白的肤色都好像变了。 他刚进花园时，脸上、脖子上和手上有淡淡的光彩，后来一直没有退去。他看上去像是有血有肉的了，而不是象牙或白蜡做的。","Mary had thought he meant something about Magic.She was a great believer in Magic.Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked Magic, of course good Magic, on everything near him and that was why people liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend.She wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous question.She felt that his Magic was working all the afternoon and making Colin look like an entirely different boy.It did not seem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his pillow.Even his ivory whiteness seemed to change.The faint glow of color which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first got inside the garden really never quite died away.He looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax."
"有两三次，他们看到知更鸟给伴儿带吃的，这让人想起下午茶，于是科林觉得他们也该吃点。","They saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times, and it was so suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some."
"“去让男仆装一些在篮子里带到杜鹃花小道上来，”他说，“然后你和迪肯再把它带到这里来。”","“Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the rhododendron walk,” he said.“And then you and Dickon can bring it here.”"
"这主意很得人心，也容易实施。当白色餐布在草地上铺开，摆上了热茶、涂了黄油的面包还有小圆烤饼后，饥肠辘辘的三人愉快地吃起来，几只外出办私事的鸟停下想看看究竟发生了什么事，然后便被引得埋头研究面包屑去了。坚果和果壳拿着几片蛋糕窜到树上，煤烟衔了整整半块涂了黄油的烤饼飞到角落里，啄了一下，检查了一番，又把它翻过来，用沙哑的声音评价了几句，然后便打定主意愉快地一口吞下了烤饼。","It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with great activity.Nut and Shell whisked up trees with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp."
" 下午正渐渐接近尾声。太阳的金色光芒正在加深，蜜蜂正往家赶，过路的鸟儿也少了。迪肯和玛丽坐在草地上，茶篮子重新包好了，准备拿回屋里，科林靠在垫子上，额前浓密的发卷往后撩起，脸色十分自然。","The afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour.The sun was deepening the gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the birds were flying past less often.Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, the tea-basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house, and Colin was lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed back from his forehead and his face looking quite a natural color."
"“我不想让这下午过去，”他说，“但明天我还会来的，后天，大后天，大大后天也来。”","“I don’t want this afternoon to go,” he said; “but I shall come back tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.”"
"“你会呼吸到大量的新鲜空气，不是么？”玛丽说。“别的我什么都不要，”他回答，“我已经看到了春天，我还想看看夏天。我要看看这里生长的一切。我自己也会在这里长大。”","“You’ll get plenty of fresh air, won’t you?” said Mary.“I’m going to get nothing else,” he answered.“I’ve seen the spring now and I’m going to see the summer.I’m going to see everything grow here.I’m going to grow here myself.”"
"“你会的，”迪肯说，“要不了多久，我们就会让你来这儿走走，还可以和其他人一样挖地。”","“That tha’ will,” said Dickon.“Us’ll have thee walkin’ about here an’ diggin’ same as other folk afore long.”"
"科林的脸一下子泛起了红润。","Colin flushed tremendously."
"“走！”他说，“挖地！ 我可以吗？”","“Walk!” he said. “Dig! Shall I?”"
"迪肯望向他，眼神慎之又慎。他和玛丽从没问过他的腿是怎么回事。","Dickon’s glance at him was delicately cautious.Neither he nor Mary had ever asked if anything was the matter with his legs."
"“你当然可以，”他坚定地说，“你——你自己也长了腿，和别人一样！”","“For sure tha’ will,” he said stoutly.“Tha—tha’s got legs o’ thine own, same as other folks!”"
"玛丽很是惶恐，直到她听到科林的回答。","Mary was rather frightened until she heard Colin’s answer."
"“我的腿其实没什么毛病，”他说，“就是太瘦太弱了。它们摇摇晃晃的，我都怕站起来了。”","“Nothing really ails them,” he said, “but they are so thin and weak.They shake so that I’m afraid to try to stand on them.”"
"玛丽和迪肯都松了口气。","Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath."
"“你不再害怕了，就可以站起来了，”迪肯又重新高兴起来，“你很快就不会害怕了。”","“When tha’ stops bein’ afraid tha’lt stand on ‘em,” Dickon said with renewed cheer.“An’ tha’lt stop bein’ afraid in a bit.”"
"“会吗？”科林说完，就静静地躺着，好像在想问题。","“I shall?” said Colin, and he lay still as if he were wondering about things."
"有那么一小段时间，他们确实非常安静。 太阳正在下沉。那个时候一切都静下来了，他们确实度过了一个忙碌而兴奋的下午。科林看起来像是在惬意地歇息。就连小动物也不再动来动去了，而是聚到了一起，在他们身旁休息。煤烟停在一根树枝上，缩起一条腿，懒洋洋地垂下灰色眼帘。玛丽暗地里觉得，它看上去像是下一刻就要打鼾的样子。","They were really very quiet for a little while.The sun was dropping lower.It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they really had had a busy and exciting afternoon.Colin looked as if he were resting luxuriously.Even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near them.Soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his eyes.Mary privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a minute."
"一片沉静之中，科林突然抬起头来，能把人吓一跳，只听他低声惊恐地叫道，","In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin half lifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:"
"“那人是谁？”迪肯和玛丽慌乱地站起来。","“Who is that man?”Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet."
"“人！”两人都低声疾呼。","“Man!” they both cried in low quick voices."
"科林指向高墙。“看！”他激动地低语道，“快看！”","Colin pointed to the high wall.“Look!” he whispered excitedly. “Just look!”"
"玛丽和迪肯推着轮椅望过去。墙头上是本•韦瑟斯塔夫那愤愤不平的脸，正从梯子顶端对他们怒目而视！他还对玛丽挥了一下拳头。","Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked.There was Ben Weatherstaff’s indignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder!He actually shook his fist at Mary."
"“要是我不是单身汉，要是你是我闺女，”他叫道，“我就揍你一顿！”","“If I wasn’t a bachelder, an’ tha’ was a wench o’ mine,” he cried, “I’d give thee a hidin’!”"
"他向上登了一级以示威胁，好像正一个劲儿地盘算着要跳下来对付玛丽；但是，当玛丽向他走过去的是时候，他显然改变了主意，只是站在梯子顶端对她挥拳头。","He mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energetic intention to jump down and deal with her; but as she came toward him he evidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his ladder shaking his fist down at her."
"“我从没想到是你！”他滔滔不绝地说，“我瞅你第一眼就不喜欢你。一个皮包骨头，一脸惨白的小丫头片子，总是问个不停，还凑到不欢迎你的地方去瞎搅和。我从来都搞不清你是怎么和我亲近起来的。要不是知更鸟——讨厌——”","“I never thowt much o’ thee!” he harangued.“I couldna’ abide thee th’ first time I set eyes on thee.A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom, allus askin’ questions an’ pokin’ tha’ nose where it wasna, wanted.I never knowed how tha’ got so thick wi’ me.If it hadna’ been for th’ robin—Drat him—”"
"“本•韦瑟斯塔夫。”玛丽缓过气来叫道。她站在下面，抬头喊的时候有点儿喘，“本•韦瑟斯塔夫，就是知更鸟给我带的路！”　这下本好像真要跳墙到她那一侧来了，他都怒火中烧了。","“Ben Weatherstaff,” called out Mary, finding her breath.She stood below him and called up to him with a sort of gasp.“Ben Weatherstaff, it was the robin who showed me the way!”Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of the wall, he was so outraged."
"“你这个小恶棍！”他朝下对她喊道，“把自己干的坏事怪到知更鸟头上——不过它也是什么事都做得出。它给你带路！它！啊！你这个小恶棍”——玛丽可以猜到他接下来要冒出什么话来，因为他已经被好奇心压倒了——“你们到底是怎么进去的？”","“Tha’ young bad ‘un!” he called down at her.“Layin’ tha’ badness on a robin—not but what he’s impidint enow for anythin’.Him showin’ thee th’ way!Him!Eh! tha’ young nowt”—she could see his next words burst out because he was overpowered by curiosity—“however i’ this world did tha’ get in?”"
"“就是知更鸟带的路，”她固执地抗议道，“它不是故意的，但确实是它带的路。而且，我也不能在这儿告诉你，你正冲我挥拳头呢。”","“It was the robin who showed me the way,” she protested obstinately.“He didn’t know he was doing it but he did.And I can’t tell you from here while you’re shaking your fist at me.”"
"就在那时，本突然停止了挥拳，越过玛丽的头顶望去，看见草地那边有什么东西正朝他靠近，他的下巴都要掉下来了。","He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and his jaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he saw coming over the grass toward him."
"科林刚听他滔滔不绝地说话时惊奇得很，只得坐起身，像被施了咒一样听着。但听着听着，他就回过神来了，端着架子差遣迪肯。","At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprised that he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound.But in the midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to Dickon."
"“推我过去！”他命令道，“推近些，到他跟前停下。”","“Wheel me over there!” he commanded.“Wheel me quite close and stop right in front of him!”"
"随你怎么想，反正这就是让本•韦瑟斯塔夫看得下巴都快掉下来的场面。一把轮椅，堆满了豪华的垫子和袍子，正向他靠近，看上去就像是御用的马车，因为轮椅上正倚着个年轻的王爷，深色睫毛的大眼睛里满是高贵的颐指气使的神色，一只白皙瘦弱的手傲慢地伸向他。那只手在本•韦瑟斯塔夫的鼻子下停住了。难怪他惊得嘴都合不拢了。","And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which made his jaw drop.A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach because a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great black-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him.And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff’s nose.It was really no wonder his mouth dropped open."
"“你知道我是谁么？”王爷质问道。","“Do you know who I am?” demanded the Rajah."
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫眼睛都直了！他那双红色的老眼盯着跟前的人，好像见了鬼。他一面瞪着眼，一面吞了口口水，却一句话也说不出来。“你知道我是谁么？”科林更高傲地质问，“答话！”","How Ben Weatherstaff stared!His red old eyes fixed themselves on what was before him as if he were seeing a ghost.He gazed and gazed and gulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word.“Do you know who I am?” demanded Colin still more imperiously. “Answer!”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫抬起粗糙的手，抚过眼睛和额头，接着用一种奇怪的颤抖的声音作了回答。","Ben Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his eyes and over his forehead and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice."
"“你是谁？”他说，“是啊，我知道——因为你脸上那双瞪着我的眼睛是你妈妈的。天知道你是怎么来到这儿的。你是个可怜的瘸子啊。”","“Who tha’ art?” he said.“Aye, that I do—wi’ tha’ mother’s eyes starin’ at me out o’ tha’ face.Lord knows how tha’ come here.But tha’rt th’ poor cripple.”"
"科林都忘记自己还有个后背了。他一下子坐得笔直，脸涨得绯红。","Colin forgot that he had ever had a back.His face flushed scarlet and he sat bolt upright."
" “我不是瘸子！”他狂怒地喊着，“不是！”","“I’m not a cripple!” he cried out furiously. “I’m not!”"
"“他不是！”玛丽也怒不可遏地冲墙上喊起来，“他身上连针尖大小的瘤都没有！我看过，根本没有——一个都没有！”","“He’s not!” cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her fierce indignation.“He’s not got a lump as big as a pin!I looked and there was none there—not one!”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫再次以手抚额，仍然盯着他看，好像永远都看不够。他的手在发抖，嘴在发抖，声音也在发抖。他是个无知的老人，不通世事，只记得自己听说过的事。","Ben Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as if he could never gaze enough.His hand shook and his mouth shook and his voice shook.He was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he could only remember the things he had heard."
"“你——你不是驼背么？”他哑着嗓子说。","“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got a crooked back?” he said hoarsely."
"“不是！”科林叫道。","“No!” shouted Colin."
"“你——你也不是罗圈腿？”本颤抖着，用更沙哑的声音问。太过分了。科林往常用来发火的力量此刻以全新的方式掠过全身。他还从来没被人说成是罗圈腿——哪怕是别人窃窃私语——本•韦瑟斯塔夫的声音说明他曾一味坚信他是个罗圈腿，这可不是王爷的血肉之躯可以忍受的。科林的怒火和受辱的自尊让他忘掉了一切，只顾着眼前，也让他充满了一种陌生的力量，一种超乎自然的力量。","“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got crooked legs?” quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.It was too much.The strength which Colin usually threw into his tantrums rushed through him now in a new way.Never yet had he been accused of crooked legs—even in whispers—and the perfectly simple belief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff’s voice was more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure.His anger and insulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment and filled him with a power he had never known before, an almost unnatural strength."
"“过来！”他一边冲迪肯喊，一边撕扯盖在腿上的毯子，自己挣扎起来，“过来！过来！马上！”","“Come here!” he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began to tear the coverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself.“Come here! Come here! This minute!”"
"迪肯马上就来到了他身边。玛丽喘了口气，缓过劲来，觉得自己脸色发白。","Dickon was by his side in a second.Mary caught her breath in a short gasp and felt herself turn pale."
"“他能做到！ 他能做到！ 他能做到！ 他能！”她以平生最快的语速喃喃自语。","“He can do it!He can do it!He can do it!He can!” she gabbled over to herself under her breath as fast as ever she could."
"科林一阵乱抓，毯子被扔到地上，迪肯扶着他的手臂，他瘦弱的腿伸了出来，瘦骨嶙峋的脚踏到了草地上。科林站得笔直——笔直——直得像一支箭，看上去异常高挑——他的头向后仰去，奇特的眼睛里闪着光。“看着我！”他向本•韦瑟斯塔夫挥舞着手臂，“看着我——说你呢！看着我！”","There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on the ground, Dickon held Colin’s arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feet were on the grass.Colin was standing upright—upright—as straight as an arrow and looking strangely tall—his head thrown back and his strange eyes flashing lightning.“Look at me!” he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff.“Just look at me—you!Just look at me!”"
"“他和我站得一样直！”迪肯叫道，“他和约克郡所有的孩子站得一样直！”","“He’s as straight as I am!” cried Dickon.“He’s as straight as any lad i’ Yorkshire!”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫的反应在玛丽看来奇怪之至。他噎住了，呛到了，突然，眼泪顺着他那饱经风霜的脸颊流下来，一双苍老的手合到了一起。","What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure.He choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled cheeks as he struck his old hands together."
"“啊！”他突然叫道，“人家在说谎啊！你瘦得像根木条，白得像个幽灵，但你身上一个瘤子也没有。你会长成个男人的。上帝保佑你！”","“Eh!” he burst forth, “th’ lies folk tells!Tha’rt as thin as a lath an’ as white as a wraith, but there’s not a knob on thee.Tha’lt make a mon yet.God bless thee!”"
"迪肯用力抓着科林的手臂，但这孩子没有摇晃。他站得越来越直，直视着本•韦瑟斯塔夫。","Dickon held Colin’s arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter.He stood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the face."
"“我是你的主人，”他说，“我爸爸不在的时候我就是主人。你要服从我。这是我的花园。你敢说一个字试试！从梯子上下来，到外面的长廊上去，玛丽小姐会到那儿见你，把你带过来。我有话对你说。我们不想你加入，但现在你必须加入到这个秘密中来了。 快点！”","“I’m your master,” he said, “when my father is away.And you are to obey me.This is my garden.Don’t dare to say a word about it!You get down from that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will meet you and bring you here.I want to talk to you.We did not want you, but now you will have to be in the secret.Be quick!”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫暴躁的老脸还是湿的，刚才突然涌出的奇怪的眼泪还没干。他仿佛没办法把眼睛从瘦弱的科林身上移开，后者站得笔直，头向后仰着。","Ben Weatherstaff’s crabbed old face was still wet with that one queer rush of tears.It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin straight Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back."
"“啊！孩子，”他几乎是在喃喃自语了，“啊！我的孩子！”然后他回过神来，猛地用花匠的惯用手法碰了碰帽子道，“是，先生！是，先生！”接着，他顺从地从梯子上下来，消失了。","“Eh! lad,” he almost whispered.“Eh! my lad!”And then remembering himself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said, “Yes, sir!Yes, sir!” and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder."
"第二十二章 太阳下山时","CHAPTER XXII WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫的脑袋出了他们的视线后，科林转向了玛丽。","When his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary."
"“去接他。”他说完，玛丽便飞奔过草地，来到常春藤下的门口。","“Go and meet him,” he said; and Mary flew across the grass to the door under the ivy."
"迪肯正用敏锐的目光注视着科林。他脸颊上有绯红的斑点，看着很是吓人，但不像是要倒吸去的样子。","Dickon was watching him with sharp eyes.There were scarlet spots on his cheeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling."
"“我能站起来了。”他说话时，头仍高高昂起，讲得颇有气势。","“I can stand,” he said, and his head was still held up and he said it quite grandly."
"“我告诉过你，只要你不害怕，很快就能站起来的，”迪肯回答，“你已经不害怕了。”","“I told thee tha’ could as soon as tha’ stopped bein’ afraid,” answered Dickon.“An’ tha’s stopped.”"
"“是啊，我不怕了。”科林说。","“Yes, I’ve stopped,” said Colin."
"突然，他想起了玛丽说过的话。","Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said."
"“你在施魔法吗？”他问得挺尖锐。","“Are you making Magic?” he asked sharply."
"迪肯翘起的嘴唇咧成了一个开心的笑。","Dickon’s curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin."
"“施魔法的是你自己，”他说，“也是这同样的魔法让这些东西从土里冒出来。”他用厚厚的靴子碰了碰草地里的一丛番红花。科林低头看着它们。","“Tha’s doin’ Magic thysel’,” he said.“It’s same Magic as made these ‘ere work out o’ th’ earth,” and he touched with his thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass.Colin looked down at them."
"“是啊，”他缓缓地说，“没有比这更厉害的魔法了——没有了。”","“Aye,” he said slowly, “there couldna’ be bigger Magic than that there—there couldna’ be.”"
"他把身子挺得比以往更直。","He drew himself up straighter than ever."
"“我要走到那棵树那里，”他指着几英尺外的一棵树说，“韦瑟斯塔夫过来的时候，我要站着。我还可以随意靠在树上。我想坐下了就坐下，但我还不想坐的时候就站着。从椅子上那条毯子带着。”","“I’m going to walk to that tree,” he said, pointing to one a few feet away from him.“I’m going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.I can rest against the tree if I like.When I want to sit down I will sit down, but not before.Bring a rug from the chair.”"
"他向那棵树走去，虽然迪肯可扶着他的胳膊，但他走得 非常稳。他靠着树干站着时，看不太出他是靠它撑着的，而且他仍然站得很直，看上去很高挑。","He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully steady.When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall."
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫从墙上的门里进来，就看到科林在那儿站着，接着他便听到玛丽在小声嘀咕着什么。","When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him standing there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath."
"“你在嘀咕啥？”他问得很不耐烦，因为他不想让人把他的注意力从那个挺拔高挑的男孩身上，还有他那张骄傲的脸上引开。","“What art sayin’?” he asked rather testily because he did not want his attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud face."
"但玛丽没告诉他。她正念叨着：","But she did not tell him.What she was saying was this:"
"“你能做到！你能做到！我说过你能！你能做到！你能做到！你能！”她对科林念叨这些，是因为她想施展魔法，让他一直能这么站着。要是他在本•韦瑟斯塔夫面前屈服，她可忍受不了。好在他没有屈服。她突然精神一振，因为她发觉，虽然科林很瘦，但看上去着实漂亮。他正带着他那有趣的傲慢之态望着本•韦瑟斯塔夫。","“You can do it!You can do it!I told you you could!You can do it!You can do it!You can!”She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep him on his feet looking like that.She could not bear that he should give in before Ben Weatherstaff.He did not give in.She was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness.He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way."
"“看着我！”他命令道，“上上下下看看清楚！ 我是驼背吗？我是罗圈腿吗？”","“Look at me!” he commanded.“Look at me all over!Am I a hunchback?Have I got crooked legs?”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫还没怎么从他的情绪中走出来，但也多多少少回过了一点神，才得以用平常的语气答话。","Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he had recovered a little and answered almost in his usual way."
"“不是，”他说，根本就不是。你以前都对自己干了些什么啊——藏得见都见不着，任由别人猜测你个瘸子，是个傻瓜？”","“Not tha’,” he said.“Nowt o’ th’ sort.What’s tha’ been doin’ with thysel’—hidin’ out o’ sight an’ lettin’ folk think tha’ was cripple an’ half-witted?”"
"“傻瓜！”科林生气地叫道，“谁这么想？”","“Half-witted!” said Colin angrily.“Who thought that?”"
"“好多笨蛋，”本说，“这世上乱叫的蠢驴多的是，除了谎话他们就叫不出什么别的了。你把自己关起来干啥？”","“Lots o’ fools,” said Ben.“Th’ world’s full o’ jackasses brayin’ an’ they never bray nowt but lies.What did tha’ shut thysel’ up for?”"
"“人人都觉得我会死，”科林不耐烦地说，“但我不会的！”","“Everyone thought I was going to die,” said Colin shortly.“I’m not!”"
"他口气坚决，说得本•韦瑟斯塔夫将他从上到下又从下到上地打量了一番。","And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up and down, down and up."
"“你会死？！”他带着干巴巴的喜悦说，“根本不可能！你勇气大着呢。我看到你那么急着要把腿放到地上，就知道你没事儿。到毯子上坐会儿吧，少爷，我听候您的吩咐。”","“Tha’ die!” he said with dry exultation.“Nowt o’ th’ sort!Tha’s got too much pluck in thee.When I seed thee put tha’ legs on th’ ground in such a hurry I knowed tha’ was all right.Sit thee down on th’ rug a bit young Mester an’ give me thy orders.”"
"他的古怪的举止里融合了粗糙的温柔和敏锐的理解。刚才沿长廊走过来的时候，玛丽就以最快的速度把话一股脑儿倒了出来。她告诉他，最重要的是要记住，科林正在好转——好转。这是花园的功劳。谁都不准让他想起驼背和死亡。","There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his manner.Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come down the Long Walk.The chief thing to be remembered, she had told him, was that Colin was getting well—getting well.The garden was doing it.No one must let him remember about having humps and dying."
"王爷屈尊地坐在了树下的毯子上。","The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree."
"“你在花园里干什么活儿，韦瑟斯塔夫？”他问道。","“What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?” he inquired."
"“让我干什么我就干什么，”本老头回答，“我是靠人情才留下的——因为她喜欢我。”","“Anythin’ I’m told to do,” answered old Ben.“I’m kep’ on by favor—because she liked me.”"
"“她？”科林说。","“She?” said Colin."
"“你妈妈。”本•韦瑟斯塔夫回答。","“Tha’ mother,” answered Ben Weatherstaff."
"“我妈妈？”科林说着，便四周环视了一圈，“这是她的花园，是吗？”","“My mother?” said Colin, and he looked about him quietly.“This was her garden, wasn’t it?”"
"“啊，正是！”本•韦瑟斯塔夫也环视四周，“她可喜欢这花园了。”","“Aye, it was that!” and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too.“She were main fond of it.”"
"“现在这是我的花园了。我很喜欢它。我每天都要来，”科林宣布道，“但这是个秘密。我的命令是，不能让任何人知道我们来这儿了。迪肯和我表妹一直在干活儿，所以它活过来了。有时我会派人叫你来帮忙——但你过来时一定不能让人看见。”","“It is my garden now.I am fond of it.I shall come here every day,” announced Colin.“But it is to be a secret.My orders are that no one is to know that we come here.Dickon and my cousin have worked and made it come alive.I shall send for you sometimes to help—but you must come when no one can see you.”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫苍老的脸扭曲着现出一个微笑。","Ben Weatherstaff’s face twisted itself in a dry old smile."
"“以前我就在没人看见时来过。”他说。","“I’ve come here before when no one saw me,” he said."
"“什么！”科林叫道，","“What!” exclaimed Colin."
"“什么时候？”","“When?”"
"“我上次来这儿，”他摩挲着下巴，环视着四周，“大概是两年前。”","“Th’ last time I was here,” rubbing his chin and looking round, “was about two year’ ago.”"
"“但这里已经十年没人来过了！”科林叫道。","“But no one has been in it for ten years!” cried Colin."
"“没有门！”","“There was no door!”"
"“我就是那个‘没人’,”本老头面无表情地幽默了一句，“我不是从门里进来的。我是翻墙进来的。最近两年我得了风湿病，就没来过了。”","“I’m no one,” said old Ben dryly.“An’ I didn’t come through th’ door.I come over th’ wall.Th’ rheumatics held me back th’ last two year’.”"
"“是你进来做的修剪！”迪肯叫道，“之前我一直都想不通这是怎么回事儿。”","“Tha’ come an’ did a bit o’ prunin’!” cried Dickon.“I couldn’t make out how it had been done.”"
"“她太喜欢这花园了——太喜欢了！”本•韦瑟斯塔夫缓缓地说，“她是那样一个年轻漂亮的人儿。有一次她对我说，‘本，’她边说边笑，‘要是我病了或是走了，你要帮我照看我的玫瑰啊。’当她真的走了，我接到的命令是谁都不准靠近。但我还是来了，”他的语气里带着乖戾的顽固，“我翻墙进来——直到被风湿病拖住——我每年都会干点活儿。是她先吩咐我的。”","“She was so fond of it—she was!” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly.“An’ she was such a pretty young thing.She says to me once, ‘Ben,’ says she laughin’, ‘if ever I’m ill or if I go away you must take care of my roses.’When she did go away th’ orders was no one was ever to come nigh.But I come,” with grumpy obstinacy.“Over th’ wall I come—until th’ rheumatics stopped me—an’ I did a bit o’ work once a year.She’d gave her order first.”"
"“要是没有你的照看，花园不会像现在这样棒，”迪肯说，“我确实好奇过。”","“It wouldn’t have been as wick as it is if tha’ hadn’t done it,” said Dickon.“I did wonder.”"
"“你做了这些我很高兴，韦瑟斯塔夫，”科林说，“你知道怎么保守秘密吧。”","“I’m glad you did it, Weatherstaff,” said Colin.“You’ll know how to keep the secret.”"
"“是的，我知道的，先生，”本回答，“而且，对于一个患风湿病的人来说，从门里进来要容易些。”","“Aye, I’ll know, sir,” answered Ben.“An’ it’ll be easier for a man wi’ rheumatics to come in at th’ door.”"
"玛丽在把小铲子扔在树旁边的草地上。科林伸手捡了起来。他脸上浮现出一种奇怪的表情，随后便开始挖土。他瘦削的手没有力气，但现在其他人都看着他——玛丽还兴致勃勃地屏住了呼吸——他竟让铲子没入了泥土，翻了一下地。","On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel.Colin stretched out his hand and took it up.An odd expression came into his face and he began to scratch at the earth.His thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him—Mary with quite breathless interest—he drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over."
"“你能行！你能行！”玛丽自言自语道。“我说过你能行！”","“You can do it!You can do it!” said Mary to herself.“I tell you, you can!”"
"迪肯圆圆的眼睛里满是热切的好奇，但他没有说话。本•韦瑟斯塔夫饶有兴趣地看着。","Dickon’s round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not a word.Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face."
"科林继续挖土。挖了好几铲子土之后，他用自己说得最地道的约克郡话兴高采烈地对迪肯讲话。","Colin persevered.After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire."
"“内说过内会让我像其他人一样能在这儿到处走走——内也说过内会让我挖地。我本来角得内只是在哄我高兴。这只是第一天，我就能走路了——现在我还能挖地。”　　听他这样说话，本•韦瑟斯塔夫又张大了嘴，但最后他轻声笑了起来。","“Tha’ said as tha’d have me walkin’ about here same as other folk—an’ tha’ said tha’d have me diggin’.I thowt tha’ was just leein’ to please me.This is only th’ first day an’ I’ve walked—an’ here I am diggin’.”Ben Weatherstaff’s mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he ended by chuckling."
"“啊！”他说，“这听上去才够聪明。你是个地道的约克郡小伙子。你也在挖地。你想不想种点儿什么？我可以给你带一盆玫瑰来。”","“Eh!” he said, “that sounds as if tha’d got wits enow.Tha’rt a Yorkshire lad for sure.An’ tha’rt diggin’, too.How’d tha’ like to plant a bit o’ somethin’?I can get thee a rose in a pot.”"
"“快去拿！”科林一边说一边兴奋地挖着，“快点！快点！”","“Go and get it!” said Colin, digging excitedly.“Quick! Quick!”"
"这事儿确实办得很快。本•韦瑟斯塔夫动身时都忘了自己的风湿了。迪肯拿起了自己的铲子，他挖的坑比那个双手白皙瘦削的新手要深，要大。玛丽溜出去，又拿着一个水壶跑回来。迪肯把坑挖深之后，科林就接着把土翻了又翻。他抬头望天，这次奇特的新式锻炼虽然轻巧，但还是让他脸色红润，荣光焕发。","It was done quickly enough indeed.Ben Weatherstaff went his way forgetting rheumatics.Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it.Mary slipped out to run and bring back a watering-can.When Dickon had deepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over.He looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was."
"“太阳沉得非常——非常低之前，我想干完它。”他说。","“I want to do it before the sun goes quite—quite down,” he said."
"玛丽觉得，也许太阳故意停留了几分钟。本•韦瑟斯塔夫从温室里搬来了一盆玫瑰。他以最快的速度蹒跚着穿过草地。他也开始兴奋起来了。他在坑旁边跪下来，把泥土从盆里弄出来。","Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose.Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse.He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could.He had begun to be excited, too.He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould."
"“拿着，孩子，”他一边说一边把植株递给科林。“你自己把它放到土里去吧，像国王到了新的地方一样。”","“Here, lad,” he said, handing the plant to Colin.“Set it in the earth thysel’ same as th’ king does when he goes to a new place.”"
"科林白皙瘦削的手抖了一下，脸上更加红润了，他把玫瑰放到坑里，本老头把土弄结实的时候，他就用手扶着玫瑰。坑里的土填满了，压实了，植株也站稳了。 玛丽的手和膝盖撑着地，身子往前探。煤烟俯冲下来，大步走向前去，看看他们在干什么。坚果和果壳在一棵樱桃树上谈论着这事儿。","The thin white hands shook a little and Colin’s flush grew deeper as he set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.It was filled in and pressed down and made steady.Mary was leaning forward on her hands and knees.Soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being done.Nut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree."
"“种好了！”最后科林说，“太阳才刚刚滑到边儿上。帮我一把，迪肯。我想站着看太阳下山。那是魔法的一部分。”","“It’s planted!” said Colin at last.“And the sun is only slipping over the edge.Help me up, Dickon.I want to be standing when it goes.That’s part of the Magic.”"
"迪肯帮他站起来，魔法——或者不管它是什么——给了他力量，当太阳真的在天边滑落，为那个可爱奇妙的下午划上句号时，科林确实自己站着——面带笑容。","And Dickon helped him, and the Magic—or whatever it was—so gave him strength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange lovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his two feet—laughing."
"第二十三章 魔法","CHAPTER XXIII MAGIC"
"他们回屋时，克雷文医生已经在那里等了有一会儿了。实际上他已经在琢磨，派人去花园探究到底是不是明智之举。科林被带到自己房间后，那个可怜人严肃地望着他。","Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it.He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send some one out to explore the garden paths.When Colin was brought back to his room the poor man looked him over seriously."
"“你不该在外面呆那么久的，”他说，“你可千万不能累过头啊。”","“You should not have stayed so long,” he said.“You must not overexert yourself.”"
"“我一点也不累，”科林说，“我倒觉得好些了。明天我上午要出去，下午也要出去。”","“I am not tired at all,” said Colin.“It has made me well.Tomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.”"
"“我不敢确定是不是能让你这样，”克雷文医生回答道，“恐怕这不是明智之举。”","“I am not sure that I can allow it,” answered Dr. Craven.“I am afraid it would not be wise.”"
"“想阻止我才不是明智之举，”科林相当严肃地说，“我就是要出去。”","“It would not be wise to try to stop me,” said Colin quite seriously.“I am going.”"
"就连玛丽都发现了，科林的怪癖之一就是，他丝毫意识不到，自己差使人的时候是个多么粗鲁的小畜牲。他从小到大都像生活在荒岛上一般，他自己就是荒岛的国王，有着自己的生活方式，从来没有人可以对比。玛丽以前也跟科林很像，但是，自从来到米瑟斯韦特，她渐渐发现自己的行事方式不正常，不受欢迎。有了这个发现之后，玛丽自然觉得把它告诉科林会很有好处。所以，克雷文医生走后，玛丽坐在那里好奇地盯着科林看了几分钟。她想引科林问她为什么要这么做，当然，她成功了。　“你看着我干什么？”科林问。","Even Mary had found out that one of Colin’s chief peculiarities was that he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with his way of ordering people about.He had lived on a sort of desert island all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his own manners and had had no one to compare himself with.Mary had indeed been rather like him herself and since she had been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind which is usual or popular.Having made this discovery she naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin.So she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone.She wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did.“What are you looking at me for?” he said."
"“我在想，我好同情克雷文医生。”","“I’m thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.”"
"“我也是，”科林回答得很平静，但也并非不带丝毫得意之态，“现在我死不了了，他得不到米瑟斯韦特庄园了。”","“So am I,” said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some satisfaction.“He won’t get Misselthwaite at all now I’m not going to die.”"
"“当然，我也为这事儿同情他，”玛丽说，“但刚才我在想，整整十年都要对一个一贯粗鲁的男孩毕恭毕敬，那一定非常可怕。我永远都做不到。”","“I’m sorry for him because of that, of course,” said Mary, “but I was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude.I would never have done it.”"
"“我粗鲁么？”科林镇定地问。","“Am I rude?” Colin inquired undisturbedly."
"“如果你是他儿子，他又是个急脾气，”玛丽说，“那他早就扇你耳光了。”","“If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,” said Mary, “he would have slapped you.”"
"“但他不敢。”科林说。","“But he daren’t,” said Colin."
"“是啊，他不敢，”玛丽小姐一边说一边不带偏见地琢磨着这事儿，“没人敢和你对着干——否则你就要死要活，或者出些类似的状况。你真是个可怜虫。”","“No, he daren’t,” answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite without prejudice.“Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn’t like—because you were going to die and things like that.You were such a poor thing.”"
"“但是，”科林固执地宣布，“我不会成为可怜虫的。我不会让别人那样想的。今天下午我自己站起来了。”","“But,” announced Colin stubbornly, “I am not going to be a poor thing.I won’t let people think I’m one.I stood on my feet this afternoon.”"
"“你就是因为一直只按自己的意愿行事才会变得这么古怪。”玛丽继续自言自语道。　　科林扭过头，皱起了眉。","“It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,” Mary went on, thinking aloud.Colin turned his head, frowning."
"“我古怪么？”他问道。","“Am I queer?” he demanded."
"“是的，”玛丽回答，“非常古怪。”“但你用不着生气，”她公道地补充说，“因为我也很古怪——本•韦瑟斯塔夫也是。在我开始喜欢别人之前，在我发现花园之前，我很古怪，现在好多了。”","“Yes,” answered Mary, “very.But you needn’t be cross,” she added impartially, “because so am I queer—and so is Ben Weatherstaff.But I am not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I found the garden.”"
"“我不想这么古怪，”科林说，“我不想成为怪人。”他又皱起了眉，下定了决心。","“I don’t want to be queer,” said Colin.“I am not going to be,” and he frowned again with determination."
"他是个很有自尊心的男孩。他躺着思考了一会儿，接着玛丽就看到他开始露出好看的微笑，他整张脸都渐渐变了。","He was a very proud boy.He lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw his beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face."
"“如果我天天都去花园，”他说，“我就不会古怪了。花园里有魔法——有益的魔法，你知道的，玛丽。我保证有。”“我也是。”玛丽回答。","“I shall stop being queer,” he said, “if I go every day to the garden.There is Magic in there—good Magic, you know, Mary.I am sure there is.”“So am I,” said Mary."
"“即使不是真有魔法，”科林说，“我们也可以假装那里有。那里一定有玄机——玄机！”","“Even if it isn’t real Magic,” Colin said, “we can pretend it is.Something is there—something!”"
"“是魔法，”玛丽说，“但不是黑色的。是像雪一样洁白的。”","“It’s Magic,” said Mary, “but not black.It’s as white as snow.”"
"他们总说那里有魔法，事实上，在接下来的那几个月里——那奇妙的几个月里——那明媚的几个月里——那惊人的几个月里——魔法似乎也确实存在。啊！花园里发生的这一切！如果你没有花园，你就不会明白，只有拥有了花园，你才会知道，要描述那里所发生的一切，需要一整本书的篇幅。起初，绿色的生命似乎永不停歇地从土壤中、草丛里、花床上甚至墙缝里往外冒。接着，绿色植物长出了花蕾，花蕾开始舒展，色彩纷呈，一抹蓝色，一抹紫色，还有一抹深红。在这样欢乐的日子里，花朵遍地绽放，每个洞穴和角落也被填满。本•韦瑟斯塔夫见过别人怎么做，所以他自己也去刮墙上砖缝间的泥灰，弄出一袋袋的泥土，好让可爱的攀缘植物生长。一束束鸢尾和白色百合花从草丛里冒出来，绿色的壁龛内填满了一丛丛蓝白相间的花，那是高高的飞燕草，或是耧斗菜，又或是风轮草。","They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months that followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazing ones.Oh! the things which happened in that garden!If you have never had a garden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there.At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the crevices of the walls.Then the green things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson.In its happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner.Ben Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things to grow on.Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas."
"“她最喜欢的就是这些——她最喜欢了，”本•韦瑟斯塔夫说， “她以前说过，她喜欢这些直指着蓝天的植物。她不是个喜欢低头瞅着地面的人——她不是。她说，她喜欢蓝天是因为它让人看着心情愉快。”","“She was main fond o’ them—she was,” Ben Weatherstaff said.“She liked them things as was allus pointin’ up to th’ blue sky, she used to tell.Not as she was one o’ them as looked down on th’ earth—not her.She just loved it but she said as th’ blue sky allus looked so joyful.”"
"迪肯和玛丽种下的种子长得飞快，像是有仙女照料一般。纤细的罂粟五彩斑斓，在风中成群地起舞，那些快乐顽皮的花朵已经在花园里住了好多年，坦白讲，它们似乎对这些新人的到来感到好奇。还有玫瑰——玫瑰！它们从草丛中探出来，缠着日冕，围着树干，从树枝上垂下来，爬到了墙上，瀑布般垂下的花环铺满了整面墙壁——他们每天每时都这样活跃。美丽的新叶，还有花蕾——花蕾——起初很小，但它们不停的膨胀，施着法术，直到舒展绽放，阵阵馨香从花朵边缘悄然溢出，又在花园的空气里弥散开去。","The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended them.Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score, gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which it might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there.And the roses—the roses!Rising out of the grass, tangled round the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades—they came alive day by day, hour by hour.Fair fresh leaves, and buds—and buds—tiny at first but swelling and working Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden air."
"科林把这一切，这每一个变化都看在眼里。每天早晨他都被带出户外，而且只要不下雨，每天每个钟头他都在花园里度过。即使是阴天他也很高兴。他说他要“躺在草地上看着万物生长”。如果你观察久一点，就会看到花蕾绽放。你还可以认识好多奇怪又忙碌的昆虫，它们四处奔忙，虽然不知道它们在忙什么，但显然那些事儿都很要紧。有时它们运送着细碎的麦秆、羽毛或食物，有时它们爬上草叶，就如同爬上了树顶一般眺望着整个国度。一只鼹鼠刨着洞口的泥土，最后终于用长指甲的、精灵一样的爪子爬了出来，科林被这个景象吸引了整整一上午。迪肯向他透露了各种各样的门道，蚂蚁的、甲壳虫的、蜜蜂的、青蛙的、小鸟的、植物的，他还补充了狐狸的、水獭的、白鼬的、松鼠的、鳟鱼的、水鼠的还有獾子的，可以聊的可以想的事情无穷无尽，科林有了一个全新的世界要去探索。　　而这一切还不到魔法的一半。他曾真的自己站起来这件事让科林思绪万千，玛丽告诉他那时她念了什么咒语之后，科林很兴奋，对这事大加赞赏。他常说起这事儿。","Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place.Every morning he was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn’t rain he spent in the garden.Even gray days pleased him.He would lie on the grass “watching things growing,” he said.If you watched long enough, he declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves.Also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on various unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country.A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands, had absorbed him one whole morning.Ants’ ways, beetles’ ways, bees’ ways, frogs’ ways, birds’ ways, plants’ ways, gave him a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added foxes’ ways, otters’ ways, ferrets’ ways, squirrels’ ways, and trout’ and water-rats’ and badgers’ ways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think over.And this was not the half of the Magic.The fact that he had really once stood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved of it greatly.He talked of it constantly."
"“当然，世上的魔法有很多，”有一天他有所领悟地说道，“但人们不知道魔法是什么样的，也不知道怎样施展法术。也许刚开始时只是不停地说着好事会发生，直到真的实现为止。我要试试看。”","“Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,” he said wisely one day, “but people don’t know what it is like or how to make it.Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen.I am going to try and experiment.”"
"第二天早晨，他们一进秘密花园，就把本•韦瑟斯塔夫叫了过来。本很快就来了，看到王爷正自己站在一棵树下，微笑着，庄严但也美好。","The next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once for Ben Weatherstaff.Ben came as quickly as he could and found the Rajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling."
"“早上好，本•韦瑟斯塔夫，”他说，“我要你和迪肯还有玛丽小姐站成一排听我说，因为我有很重要的事情要宣布。”","“Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,” he said.“I want you and Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell you something very important.”"
"“是，是，先生！”本•韦瑟斯塔夫一边回答一边以手触额敬了个礼。（这是本•韦瑟斯塔夫长期以来隐藏着的迷人之处，他年少时曾经离开家来到海边，还出过好几次海。所以他回话时像个水手。）　　“我要试着做一个科学实验，”王爷解释道，“我长大了会有重大的科学发现，而我打算以这个实验作为开端。”","“Aye, aye, sir!” answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead.(One of the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his boyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages.So he could reply like a sailor.)“I am going to try a scientific experiment,” explained the Rajah.“When I grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am going to begin now with this experiment.”"
"“是，是，先生！”本•韦瑟斯塔夫立刻答应，虽然这是他头一回听到重大科学发现这种说法。","“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the first time he had heard of great scientific discoveries."
"玛丽也是头一回听说，但即使是在那样的情况下，她也开始意识到，虽然科林很古怪，但他读书时吸收了很多独特的知识，从某种意义上说，他是个令人信服的男孩。当他仰起头，用那双奇特的眼睛盯着你时，你好像就会不由自主地相信他，尽管他只有十岁——快满十一岁了。这一刻他尤其令人信服，因为他突然感到，像个成年人一样发表演说是一件很有诱惑力的事。","It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this stage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read about a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy.When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you it seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though he was only ten years old—going on eleven.At this moment he was especially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person."
"“我要做的重大科学发现，”他继续说道，“是关于魔法的。魔法是个很神奇的东西，很少有人了解魔法，除了古书里的几个人物——玛丽懂一点，因为她出生在印度，那里有僧人。我相信迪肯懂一些魔法，但也许他自己都不知道自己懂。他能吸引住人和动物。如果他不是个驯兽师，我是不会让他来见我的——他也是个驯男孩师，因为男孩也是动物。我敢肯定魔法无处不在，只是我们的灵性不够，抓不住它，也不能让它为我们所用——就像电、马匹和蒸汽一样。”","“The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,” he went on, “will be about Magic.Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one knows anything about it except a few people in old books—and Mary a little, because she was born in India where there are fakirs.I believe Dickon knows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn’t know he knows it.He charms animals and people.I would never have let him come to see me if he had not been an animal charmer—which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy is an animal.I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us—like electricity and horses and steam.”"
"这番话太引人入胜了，本•韦瑟斯塔夫激动起来，而且没法呆立着不动了。“是啊，是啊，先生。”他一边说一边站直了身子。","This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and really could not keep still.“Aye, aye, sir,” he said and he began to stand up quite straight."
"“玛丽发现这个花园的时候，它一片萧索，”演说家继续道，“后来就有种力量把万物从土壤中往外推，在一无所有的情况下创造了生命。前一天还是空荡荡一片，第二天万物就冒出来了。我以前从没观察过生命，这让我非常好奇。研究科学的人总是很好奇的，我也打算研究科学。所以我不停地问自己，‘这是怎么回事？怎么回事？其中必有缘由。不可能无缘无故！我不知道那种力量的名字，所以我就叫它魔法。我从没见过日出，但玛丽和迪肯见过，根据他们的描述，我可以断定，那也是魔法。有种力量推拉着它。有时，进了花园后，我透过树叶看着天空，就会有种奇特的愉悦感，就好像有什么力量在我胸中推拉，让我呼吸加速。魔法总是在牵来拉去，从一无所有之中创造出万物。一切都是魔法创造的，叶子和树木，花朵和鸟儿，獾子和狐狸，还有松鼠和人类。所以，魔法就在我们身边。在这花园里——无处不在。这花园里的魔法让我站了起来，还让我知道我能活下去并长大成人。我要做个科学实验，弄些法术出来用在自己身上，让它推我拉我，把我变得更加强壮。我不知道应该怎样做，但我想如果你不停地想着它，召唤着它，它就会出现。也许这就是学会魔法的第一步。我第一次试着站起来时，玛丽就不断飞快地自言自语说，‘你能做到！你能做到！’而我也确实做到了。当然，与此同时我自己也要努力，但是，她的魔法也帮了我的忙——迪肯的也一样。每天早晨和夜晚，还有白天，只要我能想起来，我就要说，‘我身上有魔法！魔法正让我好起来！我要变得和迪肯一样强壮！和迪肯一样强壮！’而你们也要这样做。这就是我的实验。你会帮我吗，本•韦瑟斯塔夫？”","“When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,” the orator proceeded.“Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and making things out of nothing.One day things weren’t there and another they were.I had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious.Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be scientific.I keep saying to myself, ‘What is it?What is it?’It’s something.It can’t be nothing!I don’t know its name so I call it Magic.I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too.Something pushes it up and draws it.Sometimes since I’ve been in the garden I’ve looked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast.Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing.Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people.So it must be all around us.In this garden—in all the places.The Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man.I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong.I don’t know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come.Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it.When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she could, ‘You can do it!You can do it!’ and I did.I had to try myself at the same time, of course, but her Magic helped me—and so did Dickon’s.Every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say, ‘Magic is in me!Magic is making me well!I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!’And you must all do it, too.That is my experiment Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?”"
"“会的，会的，先生！”本•韦瑟斯塔夫说，“会的，会的！”","“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff.“Aye, aye!”"
"“如果你们能像士兵操练一样每天坚持这样做，我们就会看到结果，看到试验有没有成功。你学新东西的时候，靠的就是一遍一遍地念，不停地想，直到它们永远留在脑海里，我觉得魔法也是一样的。如果你不停地召唤它，请它帮助你，它就会变成你的一部分，留下来发挥作用。”“以前，印度的一个军官告诉我妈妈，一些僧人就会把一句话念上千万遍。”玛丽说。","“If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds.You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be the same with Magic.If you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.”“I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times,” said Mary."
"“我听杰姆•菲尔特沃思的老婆也把同样的话念了千万遍——她管杰姆叫醉鬼，”本•韦瑟斯塔夫不无嘲讽地说，“她肯定说过。杰姆结结实实地揍了她一顿，然后就去了蓝狮，喝得烂醉。”","“I’ve heard Jem Fettleworth’s wife say th’ same thing over thousands o’ times—callin’ Jem a drunken brute,” said Ben Weatherstaff dryly.“Summat allus come o’ that, sure enough.He gave her a good hidin’ an’ went to th’ Blue Lion an’ got as drunk as a lord.”"
"科林皱起了眉，思索了一会儿。接着他又高兴起来。","Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes.Then he cheered up."
"“啊，”他说，“你看，是有作用的。她用错了魔法，所以被他揍了一顿。如果她用对了魔法，说些好听的，那他也许就不会喝得烂醉，也许——也许他还会给她买顶新帽子。”","“Well,” he said, “you see something did come of it.She used the wrong Magic until she made him beat her.If she’d used the right Magic and had said something nice perhaps he wouldn’t have got as drunk as a lord and perhaps—perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫笑起来，那双小眼睛里透露出敏锐的钦佩之色。","Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his little old eyes."
"“你是个聪明的小伙子，也是个立得直的人，科林少爷，”他说，“下次见到贝丝•菲尔特沃思时，我会给她点暗示，告诉她魔法能起什么作用。如果科学实验起作用的话，她一定又稀罕又高兴——杰姆也一样。”","“Tha’rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,” he said.“Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I’ll give her a bit of a hint o’ what Magic will do for her.She’d be rare an’ pleased if th’ sinetifik ‘speriment worked—an’ so ‘ud Jem.”"
"迪肯一直站在那里听着，他的圆眼睛里闪着愉快的光。坚果和果壳在他肩膀上，他怀里还抱着一只长耳朵的白兔，他轻轻地抚摸着它，白兔则把耳朵耷拉在背上，怡然自乐。","Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining with curious delight.Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held a long-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself."
"“你觉得科学实验会起作用吗？”科林问迪肯，想知道他在想什么。每次他看到迪肯面带愉快的微笑望着自己或是望着他的某个“小家伙”时，他就很想知道迪肯在想什么。","“Do you think the experiment will work?”Colin asked him, wondering what he was thinking.He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking when he saw him looking at him or at one of his “creatures” with his happy wide smile."
"这会儿他就在微笑，笑得比平时都灿烂。","He smiled now and his smile was wider than usual."
"“啊，”他回答道，“我觉得能行。它会像太阳照到种子上一样起作用的。肯定能行。我们现在就开始吗？”","“Aye,” he answered, “that I do.It’ll work same as th’ seeds do when th’ sun shines on ‘em.It’ll work for sure.Shall us begin it now?”"
"科林和玛丽都很高兴。科林想起了插图上的僧侣和信徒，便得到了灵感，他让大家都盘腿坐在那棵亭亭如盖的树下。　　“这就跟坐在庙里似的，”科林说，“我很累了，想坐下来。”","Colin was delighted and so was Mary.Fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit cross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.“It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,” said Colin.“I’m rather tired and I want to sit down.”"
"“啊！”迪肯说，“你不能一开始就喊累。这会破坏魔法的。”","“Eh!” said Dickon, “tha’ mustn’t begin by sayin’ tha’rt tired.Tha’ might spoil th’ Magic.”"
"科林转身望向迪肯——望向他纯净的圆眼睛。","Colin turned and looked at him—into his innocent round eyes."
"“的确，”他缓缓说道，“我应该只想着魔法。”他们围成圈坐下来时，一切都显得那么神奇，那么神秘。本•韦瑟斯塔夫觉得自己像是被带去加入了一个祈祷会。通常他都很不愿意出席他所谓的“祈祷会”，但这次事关王爷，他便不觉得反感，反而有些感激他们叫自己来帮忙。玛丽小姐觉得气氛庄重但又满怀喜悦。迪肯怀里抱着兔子，也许他在无人知晓的情况下发出了什么驯兽师的暗号，因为他像其他人一样盘腿坐下时，乌鸦、狐狸、松树和羊羔都慢慢地靠拢来，也加入了他们这个圆圈，像是自愿安静下来的一样。","“That’s true,” he said slowly.“I must only think of the Magic.”It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their circle.Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer-meeting.Ordinarily he was very fixed in being what he called “agen’ prayer-meetin’s” but this being the Rajah’s affair he did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at being called upon to assist.Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured.Dickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer’s signal no one heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire."
"“‘小家伙’们来了，”科林严肃地说，“他们也想帮忙。”","“The ‘creatures’ have come,” said Colin gravely.“They want to help us.”"
"玛丽觉得科林看上去真的很漂亮。他像个神父一般高昂着头，奇特的眼中带着美妙的神色。阳光透过树的华盖洒到他身上。","Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought.He held his head high as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a wonderful look in them.The light shone on him through the tree canopy."
"“我们开始吧，”他说，“我们要前后摇摆么，玛丽，像修教士一样？”","“Now we will begin,” he said.“Shall we sway backward and forward, Mary, as if we were dervishes?”"
"“我没法前后摇摆，”本•韦瑟斯塔夫说，“我有风湿病。”","“I canna’ do no swayin’ back’ard and for’ard,” said Ben Weatherstaff.“I’ve got th’ rheumatics.”"
"“魔法会祛除风湿病的，”科林用主教般的语调说，“不过我们会等你的风湿病好了再摇摆。现在我们只唱唱诗就好了。”","“The Magic will take them away,” said Colin in a High Priest tone, “but we won’t sway until it has done it.We will only chant.”"
"“我不会唱诗。”本•韦瑟斯塔夫略带怒气地说，“我只试过一次，却被赶出了教堂唱诗班。”","“I canna’ do no chantin’” said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily.“They turned me out o’ th’ church choir th’ only time I ever tried it.”"
"没人笑话他。他们都太投入了。科林的脸上一丝阴影都没有。他一心只想着魔法。","No one smiled.They were all too much in earnest.Colin’s face was not even crossed by a shadow.He was thinking only of the Magic."
"“那么我来唱好了。”他说。于是他就唱了起来，看上去就像个神奇的精灵。“阳光普照——阳光普照。那就是魔法。鲜花盛开——根须生长。那就是魔法。生存是魔法——健康是魔法。魔法在我身上——魔法在我身上。在我身上——在我身上。在每个人的身上。在本•韦瑟斯塔夫的背上。魔法！魔法！　来帮助我们吧！”","“Then I will chant,” he said.And he began, looking like a strange boy spirit.“The sun is shining—the sun is shining.That is the Magic.The flowers are growing—the roots are stirring.That is the Magic.Being alive is the Magic—being strong is the Magic.The Magic is in me—the Magic is in me.It is in me—it is in me.It’s in every one of us.It’s in Ben Weatherstaff’s back.Magic!Magic!Come and help!”"
"他重复了一遍又一遍——虽没有一千次，但次数也可观。玛丽出神地听着。她觉得他唱得又奇怪又好听，并希望他一直唱下去。本•韦瑟斯塔夫觉得自己被安然送入一个愉快的梦境。蜜蜂在花间发出的嗡嗡声与唱诗的声音混合在一起，昏昏沉沉，引人入梦。迪肯盘腿坐着，怀里的兔子睡着了，他把一只手搭在羊羔备上。煤烟推开一只松鼠，靠在他肩膀上，垂下了灰色的眼帘。　最后，科林停了下来。","He said it a great many times—not a thousand times but quite a goodly number.Mary listened entranced.She felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on.Ben Weatherstaff began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable.The humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze.Dickon sat cross-legged with his rabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb’s back.Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder, the gray film dropped over his eyes.At last Colin stopped."
"“现在我要绕着花园走走。”他宣布。","“Now I am going to walk round the garden,” he announced."
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫的脑袋本来正向前垂着，这会儿猛然抬了起来。","Ben Weatherstaff’s head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with a jerk."
"“你睡着了。”科林说。","“You have been asleep,” said Colin."
"“哪有，”本嘟哝着，“这布道棒极了——但募捐之前我肯定要出去。”","“Nowt o’ th’ sort,” mumbled Ben.“Th’ sermon was good enow—but I’m bound to get out afore th’ collection.”"
"他还没完全清醒。","He was not quite awake yet."
"“你不在教堂里。”科林说。","“You’re not in church,” said Colin."
"“确实不在，”本坐直了身子，“谁说我在教堂里啊？我一字一句都听见了。你说魔法在我背上。医生管那个叫风湿。”","“Not me,” said Ben, straightening himself.“Who said I were?I heard every bit of it.You said th’ Magic was in my back.Th’ doctor calls it rheumatics.”"
"王爷挥了挥手。","The Rajah waved his hand."
"“那就是错误的魔法，”他说，“你会康复的。我准许你去工作了。不过你明天还得过来。”","“That was the wrong Magic,” he said.“You will get better.You have my permission to go to your work.But come back tomorrow.”"
"“我想看看你绕着花园走。”本嘟囔着。","“I’d like to see thee walk round the garden,” grunted Ben."
"这句嘟囔并非不友好，但再怎么说也是句嘟囔。实际上，这个倔强的老头不完全相信魔法，他已经下定决心，如果他们让他离开，他就爬上梯子从墙头往下看，这样万一有什么闪失，他可以蹒跚地奔回来。","It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt.In fact, being a stubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made up his mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look over the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling."
"王爷不反对他留下，于是，他们就排成一个队列。看上去真的像是一个队列。科林在队首，迪肯和玛丽在他左右。本•韦瑟斯塔夫走在后头，“小家伙”们跟在他们身后，羊羔和狐狸幼仔紧随着迪肯，白兔蹦蹦跳跳的，有时停下来啃啃东西，煤烟就像个统揽大局的人物似的一本正经地跟着。","The Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was formed.It really did look like a procession.Colin was at its head with Dickon on one side and Mary on the other.Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the “creatures” trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge."
"这个队列行进得很慢，但很有气势。每走几步就停下来歇会儿。科林靠在迪肯的手臂上，本•韦瑟斯塔夫暗自谨慎地瞧着，但科林时不时地把手从支撑物上移开，自己走上几步。他的头一直昂着，看上去非常庄重。","It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity.Every few yards it stopped to rest.Colin leaned on Dickon’s arm and privately Ben Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his hand from its support and walked a few steps alone.His head was held up all the time and he looked very grand."
"“魔法在我身上！·”他不停地说，“魔法让我变得强壮！我能感觉到！我能感觉到！”","“The Magic is in me!” he kept saying.“The Magic is making me strong!I can feel it!I can feel it!”"
"显然有什么东西在支撑着他，托举着他。他在壁龛的座位上坐下过，还在草地上坐下过一两次，有几回他在小径上停下脚步，靠在迪肯身上，但是，不绕着花园走上一圈，他是不会放弃的。回到大树的华盖之下，科林的脸颊通红，显出凯旋而归的神色。","It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him.He sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on the grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, but he would not give up until he had gone all round the garden.When he returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked triumphant."
"“我做到了！魔法显灵了！”他叫道，“这是我的第一个科学发现！”","“I did it!The Magic worked!” he cried.“That is my first scientific discovery.”."
"“克雷文医生会怎么说？”玛丽问道。","“What will Dr. Craven say?” broke out Mary."
"“他什么都不会说，”科林回答，“因为没人会告诉他。这可是我们最大的秘密啊。在我变得强壮到可以像其他男孩一样跑跑跳跳之前，别对任何人透露一丁点儿风声。每天我都会坐轮椅过来，回去的时候也坐着轮椅。我不会让人说三道四，问东问西，也不会让我爸爸听到风声，直到实验大获成功。那样，他哪天回米瑟韦斯特庄园的时候，我就会走到他书房里说，‘我来了；我和其他男孩没什么差别。我很好，我会活下去，长大成人。这多亏了一个科学实验。’”","“He won’t say anything,” Colin answered, “because he will not be told.This is to be the biggest secret of all.No one is to know anything about it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any other boy.I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken back in it.I won’t have people whispering and asking questions and I won’t let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded.Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into his study and say ‘Here I am; I am like any other boy.I am quite well and I shall live to be a man.It has been done by a scientific experiment.’”"
"“他会以为自己在做梦，”玛丽叫道，“他不会相信自己的眼睛的。”","“He will think he is in a dream,” cried Mary.“He won’t believe his eyes.”"
"科林得意地涨红了脸。他让自己确信他能康复，而做到这一点也就成功了一半多了，假如他能意识到的话。而最能鼓舞他的念头是，当他父亲看到自己的儿子和其他人的儿子一样挺拔强健时，他会是什么样子。过去的病中岁月里，最令他心灰意冷的痛苦之一，就是自己的父亲害怕见到他这个病怏怏的儿子，这让他满怀着愤懑。","Colin flushed triumphantly.He had made himself believe that he was going to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he had been aware of it.And the thought which stimulated him more than any other was this imagining what his father would look like when he saw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers’ sons.One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had been his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him."
"“他不信也得信，”他说，","“He’ll be obliged to believe them,” he said."
"“魔法显灵后，我开始作出科学发现之前，我要做的事情之一，就是成为一个运动员。”","“One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.”"
"“在过一周左右，我们就带你去打拳击，”本•韦瑟斯塔夫说，“你会胜利夺魁，成为全英格兰的职业拳击冠军。”","“We shall have thee takin’ to boxin’ in a week or so,” said Ben Weatherstaff.“Tha’lt end wi’ winnin’ th’ Belt an’ bein’ champion prize-fighter of all England.”"
"科林目不转睛地盯着本。　“韦瑟斯塔夫，”他说，“这很失礼啊。你不能仗着自己知道秘密就随意放肆。不管魔法有多灵验，我都不会成为一个职业拳击手。我要当个科学家。”","Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.“Weatherstaff,” he said, “that is disrespectful.You must not take liberties because you are in the secret.However much the Magic works I shall not be a prize-fighter.I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.”"
"“请您原谅——请您原谅，先生，”本一边行礼一边回答道，“我应该明白这不是开玩笑。”但是他眨了眨眼睛，暗地里乐坏了。他不介意受到斥责，因为斥责便意味着这男孩正在长力气，长精神。","“Ax pardon—ax pardon, sir” answered Ben, touching his forehead in salute.“I ought to have seed it wasn’t a jokin’ matter,” but his eyes twinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased.He really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit."
"第二十四章 “让他们笑吧”","CHAPTER XXIV “LET THEM LAUGH”"
"迪肯不只在秘密花园里干活。原野上的小屋附近，有一块被粗糙的石头矮墙包围的地。在清晨和暮色渐退的傍晚，或是在他不去见科林和玛丽的日子里，迪肯就在这儿干活，帮妈妈栽种或照料番茄、卷心菜、小萝卜、胡萝卜和各种香草。在他的“小家伙们”的陪伴下，迪肯在那里创造了不少奇景，并好像乐此不疲。挖坑或者除草的时候，他就吹吹口哨，或哼上几句约克郡牧歌，或者就跟煤烟、队长还有受他指导前来帮忙的兄弟姐妹们说话。","The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in.Round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones.Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother.In the company of his “creatures” he did wonders there and was never tired of doing them, it seemed.While he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him."
"“要不是因为迪肯这个园子，”索尔比太太说，“我们永远也不会有现在这么舒坦。他种什么就长什么。他的山药和卷心菜的个头是别人的两倍，还有一种别家没有的味道。”","“We’d never get on as comfortable as we do,” Mrs. Sowerby said, “if it wasn’t for Dickon’s garden.Anything’ll grow for him.His ‘taters and cabbages is twice th’ size of any one else’s an’ they’ve got a flavor with ‘em as nobody’s has.”"
"她得了点空闲的时候就喜欢出去和他聊天。晚饭过后，暮光还会持续一段时间，这时还可以干点活儿，那就是她安静下来的时候。她会坐在矮墙上看着，听着当天的故事。她喜欢这个时段。园子里不仅仅是蔬菜。迪肯会时不时买些几分钱一包的花籽，在醋栗丛甚至卷心菜之间种上一些颜色鲜亮，气味芬芳的植物，他在边缘处种上了木樨、石竹和三色堇等等，那些植物每年都有种子可以留存，或者每年春天，它们的根都会开花，并适时地生长成簇。 矮墙是约克郡最漂亮的景致之一，因为迪肯在每道缝隙中都填上了旷野的洋地黄、蕨草、石水芹和会攀着篱笆生长的花，石头隐没其中，只能偶尔瞥见。","When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him.After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time.She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day.She loved this time.There were not only vegetables in this garden.Dickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps.The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen."
"“妈妈，要让它们长得茂盛，”迪肯说，“你只要和它们真正交上朋友就行了。它们和小动物们一样。它们渴了就给它们水喝，它们饿了就给它们东西吃。它们想要和我们一样生活。如果它们没能成活，我会觉得自己是个坏人，对它们那么无情。”","“All a chap’s got to do to make ‘em thrive, mother,” he would say, “is to be friends with ‘em for sure.They’re just like th’ ‘creatures.’If they’re thirsty give ‘em drink and if they’re hungry give ‘em a bit o’ food.They want to live same as we do.If they died I should feel as if I’d been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.”"
"索尔比太太就是在这暮色低垂的时候听说米瑟斯韦特庄园里发生的一切的。起初，她只是听说“科林少爷”喜欢上了和玛丽小姐一起外出，而且这对他有好处。不过，不久之后，两个孩子就达成了一致，同意迪肯的妈妈“加入秘密”。不知怎么的，他们都坚信她是“铁定可靠”的。","It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor.At first she was only told that “Mester Colin” had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him good.But it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that Dickon’s mother might “come into the secret.”Somehow it was not doubted that she was “safe for sure.”"
"所以，在一个美丽安静的傍晚，迪肯把整件事情和盘托出，包括所有激荡人心的细节，比如埋在地里的钥匙，知更鸟，看似毫无生气的灰色雾霭，还有玛丽小姐本打算永不透露的秘密。迪肯到来，得知这个秘密，科林少爷心怀疑虑，但最终被引入秘密领地，加上本•韦瑟斯塔夫那愤怒的脸庞出现在墙头，科林少爷在愤慨之下力量突发，这一切让索尔比太太漂亮的脸变了好几次颜色。　　“天哪！”她说，“那小姑娘来庄园可真是件好事呢。既成就了她，也挽救了他。自己站起来！我们都以为他是个可怜的傻子，浑身没有一根骨头是直的。”","So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal.The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him, the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff’s angry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin’s sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby’s nice-looking face quite change color several times.“My word!” she said.“It was a good thing that little lass came to th’ Manor.It’s been th’ makin’ o’ her an’ th’ savin, o’ him.Standin’ on his feet!An’ us all thinkin’ he was a poor half-witted lad with not a straight bone in him.”"
"她问了好多问题，蓝色的眼睛里满是深思的神色。","She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep thinking."
"“庄园里的人会怎么想啊——他现在这么健康快乐，还从不抱怨？”她问道。“他们都摸不着头脑，”迪肯回答，“他的脸每天都不一样。他的脸变得饱满起来，看上去不那么尖了，蜡一样的颜色也退下去了。但他有时还是必须要抱怨一下。”说着迪肯高兴地笑起来。　　“哎呀，这是为什么呢？”索尔比太太问。","“What do they make of it at th’ Manor—him being so well an’ cheerful an’ never complainin’?” she inquired.“They don’t know what to make of it,” answered Dickon.“Every day as comes round his face looks different.It’s fillin’ out and doesn’t look so sharp an’ th’ waxy color is goin’.But he has to do his bit o’ complainin’,” with a highly entertained grin.“What for, i’ Mercy’s name?” asked Mrs. Sowerby."
"迪肯咯咯地笑着。","Dickon chuckled."
"“为了不让别人猜测到底发生了什么。如果医生发现他可以自己站起来，他肯定会写信告诉克雷文老爷的。科林少爷要留着这个秘密亲自告诉老爷。他打算每天都在腿上施魔法，直到他父亲回来，那时他就会大步走进他的房间，让他看看自己的儿子和别的年轻人一样挺拔。而他和玛丽小姐都觉得，最好要时不时地装出点哼哼唧唧的样子来掩人耳目。”","“He does it to keep them from guessin’ what’s happened.If the doctor knew he’d found out he could stand on his feet he’d likely write and tell Mester Craven.Mester Colin’s savin’ th’ secret to tell himself.He’s goin’ to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his father comes back an’ then he’s goin’ to march into his room an’ show him he’s as straight as other lads.But him an’ Miss Mary thinks it’s best plan to do a bit o’ groanin’ an’ frettin’ now an’ then to throw folk off th’ scent.”"
"没等迪肯说完最后一句话，索尔比太太就发出舒心的轻笑。","Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had finished his last sentence."
"“啊！”她说，“我敢肯定他俩在自得其乐呢。他们有好多戏要演，对孩子来说，没有比演戏更好玩的了。我们来听听他们做了些什么吧，迪肯。”迪肯停止了除草，蹲坐起来讲给她听。他的眼中闪着愉快的光。","“Eh!” she said, “that pair’s enjoyin’ their-selves I’ll warrant.They’ll get a good bit o’ actin’ out of it an’ there’s nothin’ children likes as much as play actin’.Let’s hear what they do, Dickon lad.”Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her.His eyes were twinkling with fun."
"“科林少爷每次出去都是坐在轮椅里被抬下楼的，”他解释道，“他还对那个叫约翰的脚夫大发脾气，嫌他不够小心。他尽量让自己显得无助，直到从房子里看不到我们了，他才抬起头来。别人把他抱到轮椅上的时候，他可没少嘟囔。他和玛丽小姐都乐在其中，他呻吟抱怨的时候，她就会说‘可怜的科林！你疼得那么厉害啊？你这么虚弱啊，可怜的科林？’——但问题是，有时他们会忍不住笑场。我们进入花园的安全地带时，他们就开怀大笑，笑到喘不过气来。他们必须把脸埋在科林少爷的靠枕里，否则附近有花匠的话，就会听见的。”","“Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,” he explained.“An’ he flies out at John, th’ footman, for not carryin’ him careful enough.He makes himself as helpless lookin’ as he can an’ never lifts his head until we’re out o’ sight o’ th’ house.An’ he grunts an’ frets a good bit when he’s bein’ settled into his chair.Him an’ Miss Mary’s both got to enjoyin’ it an’ when he groans an’ complains she’ll say, ‘Poor Colin!Does it hurt you so much?Are you so weak as that, poor Colin?’—but th’ trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin’ out laughin’.When we get safe into the garden they laugh till they’ve no breath left to laugh with.An’ they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin’s cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin’, if any of, ‘em’s about.”"
"“他们笑得越多越好！”索尔比太太自己也笑着说，“健康的孩子的笑声比任何要都要好。他们俩肯定会长胖的。”","“Th’ more they laugh th’ better for ‘em!” said Mrs. Sowerby, still laughing herself.“Good healthy child laughin’s better than pills any day o’ th’ year.That pair’ll plump up for sure.”"
"“他们正在长胖呢，”迪肯说，“他们那么饿，不说谎就没办法弄到足够的东西吃。科林少爷说，如果他不停地要吃的，他们就不会相信他是个残疾人了。玛丽小姐说，她会让科林少爷吃她那一份，但科林少爷说，如果她饿了就会瘦下去，他希望他们俩都能长胖。”","“They are plumpin’ up,” said Dickon.“They’re that hungry they don’t know how to get enough to eat without makin’ talk.Mester Colin says if he keeps sendin’ for more food they won’t believe he’s an invalid at all.Miss Mary says she’ll let him eat her share, but he says that if she goes hungry she’ll get thin an’ they mun both get fat at once.”"
"他们碰到的这个障碍让索尔比太太会心地笑了，她穿着蓝色斗篷，笑得前仰后合，迪肯也一起笑起来。","Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her."
"“我告诉你怎么办吧，孩子，”索尔比太太缓过气来，“我想出了一个能帮助他们的办法。你早晨去他们那里的时候，提上一桶新鲜好奶，我会给他们烤一份农家脆皮面包或者做一些带葡萄干的小圆面包，就是你们几个孩子喜欢的那种。没有比新鲜牛奶和面包更好的了。这样他们在花园里的时候就可以垫垫饥，而屋里的精美食物就能把他们的胃填满了。”","“I’ll tell thee what, lad,” Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak.“I’ve thought of a way to help ‘em.When tha’ goes to ‘em in th’ mornin’s tha’ shall take a pail o’ good new milk an’ I’ll bake ‘em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi’ currants in ‘em, same as you children like.Nothin’s so good as fresh milk an’ bread.Then they could take off th’ edge o’ their hunger while they were in their garden an’ th, fine food they get indoors ‘ud polish off th’ corners.”"
"“啊！妈妈！”迪肯崇拜地叫道，“你真有办法！你总是能解决问题。昨天他们可烦了好一阵呢。他们不知道不叫更多吃的要怎么撑下去——他们觉得腹中空空的。”","“Eh! mother!” said Dickon admiringly, “what a wonder tha’ art!Tha’ always sees a way out o’ things.They was quite in a pother yesterday.They didn’t see how they was to manage without orderin’ up more food—they felt that empty inside.”"
"“他们两个孩子正在长身体，两人都恢复健康了。那样的孩子就像小狼，食物就像是他们的血肉。”索尔比太太说。接着她像迪肯一样翘起嘴角笑了。“啊！但他们一定正自得其乐。”她说。　　这个随和又奇妙的母亲没有猜错——尤其是她说他们会很享受“演戏”这一点。科林和玛丽觉得那是他们最刺激的娱乐项目之一。他们想到这个保护自己免遭怀疑的主意，起初是因为困惑的护士在无意中提醒了他们，后来克雷文医生也起了作用。","“They’re two young ‘uns growin’ fast, an’ health’s comin’ back to both of ‘em.Children like that feels like young wolves an’ food’s flesh an’ blood to ‘em,” said Mrs. Sowerby.Then she smiled Dickon’s own curving smile.“Eh! but they’re enjoyin’ theirselves for sure,” she said.She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature—and she had never been more so than when she said their “play actin’” would be their joy.Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment.The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by Dr. Craven himself."
"“你的胃口大有进步啊，科林少爷，”有一天护士说，“你以前什么都不吃，很多东西你都不能吃。”","“Your appetite. Is improving very much, Master Colin,” the nurse had said one day.“You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed with you.”"
"“现在没有我不能吃的东西了。”科林说罢，便看到护士好奇地望着自己，他突然想到现在也许还不该显示出自己有多健康。“至少没那么多不能吃的东西了。是新鲜空气的作用。”","“Nothing disagrees with me now” replied Colin, and then seeing the nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he ought not to appear too well just yet.“At least things don’t so often disagree with me.It’s the fresh air.”"
"“也许是吧，”护士一边说一边带着困惑的表情继续望着他，“但我得告诉克雷文医生去。”","“Perhaps it is,” said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystified expression.“But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.”"
"“瞧她是怎么盯着你的！”护士走后玛丽说道，“好像她觉得有什么东西一定要查个明白。”","“How she stared at you!” said Mary when she went away.“As if she thought there must be something to find out.”"
"“我不会让她查出什么来的，”科林说，“不能让任何人查出来。”那天早晨克雷文医生来的时候，也显得很困惑。他问了几个问题，让科林大为恼火。","“I won’t have her finding out things,” said Colin.“No one must begin to find out yet.”When Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled, also.He asked a number of questions, to Colin’s great annoyance."
"“你呆在花园里的时间不少啊，”他说，“你都去了哪里啊？”","“You stay out in the garden a great deal,” he suggested.“Where do you go?”"
"科林摆出了他最喜欢的架势，高傲且冷冰冰地回应别人的话。","Colin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion."
"“我不会让任何人知道我去了哪里，”他回答，“我去了我喜欢的地方。每个人都接到命令要回避。我不想被人瞧着盯着。这个你知道！”","“I will not let any one know where I go,” he answered.“I go to a place I like.Every one has orders to keep out of the way.I won’t be watched and stared at.You know that!”"
"“好像你整天都在外面，但我不觉得这对你有什么坏处——我不那么想。护士说你的饭量比以前大多了。”","“You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm—I do not think so.The nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before.”"
"“也许吧，”科林灵机一动，说道，“也许这是种不正常的胃口。”　","“Perhaps,” said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, “perhaps it is an unnatural appetite.”"
"“我不觉得，因为你吃了这些东西没什么不舒服，”克雷文医生说，“你长肉长得很快，气色也好多了。”","“I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,” said Dr. Craven.“You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.”"
"“也许——也许我是浮肿、发烧，”科林一边说一边装出沮丧的神色，“短命的人一般都是——和别人不一样的。”克雷文医生摇了摇头。他正握着科林的手腕，把他的袖子往上推了推，在他胳膊上比划了一下。","“Perhaps—perhaps I am bloated and feverish,” said Colin, assuming a discouraging air of gloom.“People who are not going to live are often—different.”Dr. Craven shook his head.He was holding Colin’s wrist and he pushed up his sleeve and felt his arm."
"“你没发烧，”他若有所思地说，“你长胖是正常的。如果你能保持这样的状态，孩子，我们就没必要谈死了。你父亲听到你好转了一定很高兴。”","“You are not feverish,” he said thoughtfully, “and such flesh as you have gained is healthy.If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not talk of dying.Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement.”"
"“不许告诉他！”科林勃然大怒，“如果我病情又恶化，那只会让他更加失望——我今晚就会恶化的。我可能会发高烧。现在我就有点感觉了。不准给我父亲写信——不准——不准！你真让我生气，你知道这对我没好处。我已经觉得热了。我不喜欢别人在信里谈到我，不喜欢被人说三道四，就像我不喜欢别人盯着我看一样！”","“I won’t have him told!”Colin broke forth fiercely.“It will only disappoint him if I get worse again—and I may get worse this very night.I might have a raging fever.I feel as if I might be beginning to have one now.I won’t have letters written to my father—I won’t—I won’t!You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me.I feel hot already.I hate being written about and being talked over as much as I hate being stared at!”"
"“嘘！孩子，”克雷文医生安抚道，“没有你的允许，我什么都不会写。你太敏感了。你别把已经发生的好事给毁了。”","“Hush-h! my boy,” Dr. Craven soothed him.“Nothing shall be written without your permission.You are too sensitive about things.You must not undo the good which has been done.”"
"他不再提给克雷文先生写信的事情了，见到护士的时候，他私下里叮嘱她，千万别告诉病人他有可能写信的事。","He said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse he privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned to the patient."
"“这孩子好转了很多了，”他说，“这种好转好像都有些超常了。不过，现在他愿意做我们以前没法让他做的事了。他仍然很容易激动，不能说任何刺激他的话。”玛丽和科林大为警觉，他们一起紧张地商量对策。他们的“演戏”计划就是在这时候应运而生的。","“The boy is extraordinarily better,” he said.“His advance seems almost abnormal.But of course he is doing now of his own free will what we could not make him do before.Still, he excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him.”Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously.From this time dated their plan of “play actin’.”"
"“我可能得发一次脾气了，”科林不无遗憾地说，“可我不想发脾气，现在我没什么好生气的，可能没法大吵大闹。也许我根本就发不出火。我喉咙里没长包，我脑子里想的也都是好事，而不是可怕的事情。但如果他们说要给我父亲写信，我就要采取行动了。”","“I may be obliged to have a tantrum,” said Colin regretfully.“I don’t want to have one and I’m not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one.Perhaps I couldn’t have one at all.That lump doesn’t come in my throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones.But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do something.”"
"他决定少吃点东西，但后来他发现这绝妙的办法根本行不通，因为每天早晨他醒来后都胃口奇好，沙发旁的桌子上放着早点，有家里自制的面包，新鲜的黄油，雪白的鸡蛋，还有木莓酱和凝脂奶油。玛丽总是和他一起吃早饭，每次他们坐到桌前——尤其是一片片精美的滋滋冒油的火腿从银罩地下发出诱人的香气时——他们就会绝望地望着对方的眼睛。","He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream.Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the table—particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover—they would look into each other’s eyes in desperation."
"“我觉得今天早晨我们会把这些都吃光的，玛丽，”每到最后，科林总是这样说，“午饭和晚饭我们多剩下一点吧。”","“I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,” Colin always ended by saying.“We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner.”"
"但他们从来都没法剩下什么，吃得干干净净的盘子被送回去的时候总能引发不少议论。","But they never found they could send away anything and the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened much comment."
"“我真希望，”科林也会说，“我真希望火腿片再厚一点，而且一个小松糕谁都吃不饱。”","“I do wish,” Colin would say also, “I do wish the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.”"
"“对一个将死之人来说足够了，”头一回听他这么说时，玛丽回应道，“但对一个还要活下去的人来说是不够的。石南花和荆豆花的香味从原野上飘过来，飘进开着的窗子里时，我就觉得我能吃下三块松糕。”","“It’s enough for a person who is going to die,” answered Mary when first she heard this, “but it’s not enough for a person who is going to live.I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.”"
"那天早晨——当他们在花园里玩了两个钟头之后——迪肯来到了一大丛玫瑰花后，提着两个白铁桶，告诉他们一个桶里盛满了新鲜牛奶，顶上还有奶油，另一个桶里装的是农家自制的葡萄干小圆面包，用一块干净的蓝白相间的餐巾包着，保温工作做得很好，小圆面包还是热的，他们得知后一阵狂喜。索尔比太太的主意多么美妙啊！她是个多么善良聪明的女人啊！小圆面包真好吃！新鲜牛奶那么可口！","The morning that Dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves in the garden for about two hours—went behind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness.What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of!What a kind, clever woman she must be!How good the buns were!And what delicious fresh milk!"
"“她身上有魔法，和迪肯一样，”科林说，“这就会让她想出办法去做事——好事。她是个有魔力的人。迪肯，告诉她，我们很感激——极为感激。”有时他会使用成年人的语言。他喜欢这样说话。正因为喜欢，所以他在这方面进步很快。","“Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,” said Colin.“It makes her think of ways to do things—nice things.She is a Magic person.Tell her we are grateful, Dickon—extremely grateful.”He was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times.He enjoyed them.He liked this so much that he improved upon it."
"“告诉她，她慷慨之极，我们至为感荷。”","“Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.”"
"但紧接着他就把方才的辉煌抛到了脑后，开始猛吃猛喝桶里的小面包和牛奶，就像别的饥肠辘辘的小男孩一样，做了剧烈运动，又呼吸了原野上的空气，而早饭已经吃完两个多小时了。","And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him."
"这是许多类似巧合的开端。他们突然意识到，索尔比太太要给十四个人准备吃的，所以她可能没有足够的食物每天填饱另外两个人的肚子。因此，他们想求得她同意，送些先令过去买东西。","This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every day.So they asked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy things."
"迪肯发现了一件令人兴奋的事情，花园外的林子里，就是玛丽第一次看到他对野生动物们吹笛子的地方，有一个小小的深坑，可以在那里用石头搭一个小灶来烤土豆和鸡蛋。烤鸡蛋是他们以前从未发现的珍馐，滚烫的土豆加了盐和新鲜黄油之后配得上森林之王——另外，它也美味可口。你可以买土豆买鸡蛋，想吃多少就吃多少，而且不会觉得自己像是在从十四个人口中瓜分食物。","Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it.Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king—besides being deliciously satisfying.You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people."
"每个美丽的清晨，他们都在李树下围成神秘的一圈，施展着魔法，短暂的花期过去之后，李树浓密的叶片已亭亭如盖。仪式完成之后，科林总是要走路锻炼一下，在一整天内，他每隔一段时间就会实践一下自己新发现的力量。他一天天变强壮，步伐越拉越稳，能走得距离也越来越长了。而他对魔法的信任感也一天天增强——魔法也可能一天比一天灵验。他做了一个又一个试验，觉得自己正汲取力量，而迪肯则把一个最好的消息告诉了他。","Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended.After the ceremony Colin always took his walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly found power at intervals.Each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground.And each day his belief in the Magic grew stronger—as well it might.He tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him the best things of all."
"“昨天，”他缺席了一天，第二日早上便说道，“妈妈让我去了斯威特，我在蓝牛旅馆附近看到了鲍勃•霍尔沃斯。他是原野上最强壮的人了。他是摔跤冠军，跳得比任何人都高，锤子也比任何都都扔得远。有几年他到苏格兰去比赛。我从小就认识他，他是个和气的人，我问了他几个问题。绅士们都管他叫运动健将，这让我想起了你，科林少爷，于是我便说，‘你是怎么让你的肌肉鼓出来的，鲍勃？你是不是额外做了什么才能让它们那么强壮？’他说‘啊，是的，孩子，是这样。一个来斯威特表演的壮汉曾经告诉我怎么锻炼胳膊、腿和全身每一处肌肉。我说，‘一个虚弱的人能不能用这种方法让自己变强壮呢，鲍勃？’他笑道，‘你是那个虚弱的人么？’我说，‘不是，但我认识一个年轻绅士，病了很久，现在正在康复，所以我想学习诀窍好告诉他。’我没把名字告诉他，他也没问。就像我所说的，他很和气，好心地站起来向我演示，我跟着模仿，直到记在心里。”","“Yesterday,” he said one morning after an absence, “I went to Thwaite for mother an’ near th’ Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth.He’s the strongest chap on th’ moor.He’s the champion wrestler an’ he can jump higher than any other chap an’ throw th’ hammer farther.He’s gone all th’ way to Scotland for th’ sports some years.He’s knowed me ever since I was a little ‘un an’ he’s a friendly sort an’ I axed him some questions.Th’ gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o’ thee, Mester Colin, and I says, ‘How did tha’ make tha’ muscles stick out that way, Bob?Did tha’ do anythin’ extra to make thysel’ so strong?’An’ he says ‘Well, yes, lad, I did.A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an’ legs an’ every muscle in my body.An’ I says, ‘Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with ‘em, Bob?’ an’ he laughed an’ says, ‘Art tha’ th’ delicate chap?’ an’ I says, ‘No, but I knows a young gentleman that’s gettin’ well of a long illness an’ I wish I knowed some o’ them tricks to tell him about.’I didn’t say no names an’ he didn’t ask none.He’s friendly same as I said an’ he stood up an’ showed me good-natured like, an’ I imitated what he did till I knowed it by heart.”"
"科林兴奋地听着。","Colin had been listening excitedly."
"“你能演示给我看看么？”他叫道，“可以么？”","“Can you show me?” he cried.“Will you?”"
"“啊，当然可以，”迪肯一边回答一边站起来，“但他说开始的时候动作一定要轻柔，不要太累。中间要休息，深呼吸，别做过份了。”","“Aye, to be sure,” Dickon answered, getting up.“But he says tha’ mun do ‘em gentle at first an’ be careful not to tire thysel’.Rest in between times an’ take deep breaths an’ don’t overdo.”"
"“我会小心的，”科林说，“让我看看吧！让我看看吧！迪肯，你是这世界上最神奇的男孩！”","“I’ll be careful,” said Colin.“Show me!Show me!Dickon, you are the most Magic boy in the world!”"
"迪肯站在草地上，慢慢做了一套经过精心设计的、实用且简单的肌肉训练。科林睁大了眼睛看着。他坐着的时候就已经学会几个动作了。他稳稳地站起来后，就轻轻地做了几个动作。玛丽也开始做。煤烟看表演看得很困惑，它离开了树枝，焦躁地四处蹦着，因为它不能跟着做。　　从此之后，这套练习和魔法一样，成了每天的任务。科林和玛丽每次都可以做更多的动作，结果胃口大开，要不是迪肯每天早晨过来时把篮子放在灌木丛后，他们可能就不知所措了。但是坑里的小灶和索尔比太太的慷慨举动太凑效了，梅德洛克太太、护士和克雷文医生又产生了疑虑。要是你肚子里装满了烤鸡蛋、土豆、新鲜得冒泡的牛奶、燕麦饼、小圆面包、石南蜜还有凝脂奶油，那你就可以对早餐置之不理，对午餐嗤之以鼻了。","Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises.Colin watched them with widening eyes.He could do a few while he was sitting down.Presently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet.Mary began to do them also.Soot, who was watching the performance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly because he could not do them too.From that time the exercises were part of the day’s duties as much as the Magic was.It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have been lost.But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby’s bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again.You can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream."
"“他们几乎什么都不吃，”护士说，“要是他们不听劝告，不肯吸收些营养，就要饿死了。但瞧瞧他们的样子。”","“They are eating next to nothing,” said the nurse.“They’ll die of starvation if they can’t be persuaded to take some nourishment.And yet see how they look.”"
"“看！”梅德洛克太太愤愤不平地叫道，“啊！我对他们一点也搞不明白。他们真是一对小恶魔。今天把外套撑破，明天又对厨师能做出来的最好的饭菜嗤之以鼻。昨天，那么好吃的童子鸡和牛奶沙司，他们动都没动——那个可怜的女人还为他们精心炮制了一种布丁——结果给原封不动地送了回来。她差点哭出来。要是他们被饿死了，她怕会怪到她头上。”","“Look!” exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly.“Eh!I’m moithered to death with them.They’re a pair of young Satans.Bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with.Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday—and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them—and back it’s sent.She almost cried.She’s afraid she’ll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves.”"
"克雷文医生过来仔仔细细地对科林做了一番长时间的检查。护士与他交谈，把她保管好的几乎动都没动的早餐拿给他看时，他的表情极其焦虑——但他在科林的沙发旁坐下来为他作检查时，他的表情更焦虑了。他先前去伦敦出诊，已经有两个星期没见到这孩子了。年轻人康复起来是很快的。那层浅浅的蜡色消失了，科林的肤色中透出温暖的玫瑰红；他漂亮的眼睛很清澈，眼睛下、双颊和太阳穴处的凹陷已经不见了。他那深色的、浓密的发丝像是从前额长出，看起来很健康，又柔又暖，很有生气。他的嘴唇更饱满了，颜色也正常了。实际上，要装成一个被认定是身患疾病的男孩，他一点都不像。克雷文医生的手捏着下巴，反复琢磨着。","Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at—but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin’s sofa and examined him.He had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks.When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly.The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out.His once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life.His lips were fuller and of a normal color.In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight.Dr. Craven held his chin in his hand and thought him over."
"“真遗憾，我听说你什么都不吃，”他说，“那可不行。你会前功尽弃的——你现在已经有很大进步了。不久前你胃口还很好。”","“I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,” he said.“That will not do.You will lose all you have gained—and you have gained amazingly.You ate so well a short time ago.”"
"“我跟你说过那种胃口不正常。”科林回答。","“I told you it was an unnatural appetite,” answered Colin."
"玛丽坐在旁边的脚凳上，她突然发出奇怪的声音，又尽力想把那声音压下去，结果差点呛着。","Mary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer sound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost choking."
"“怎么了？”克雷文医生扭头看着玛丽，问道。","“What is the matter?” said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her."
"玛丽马上摆出一副严肃的态度。","Mary became quite severe in her manner."
"“我又想打喷嚏又想咳嗽，”她庄重又带几分责备地回答说，“后来给我咽到喉咙里去了。”","“It was something between a sneeze and a cough,” she replied with reproachful dignity, “and it got into my throat.”"
"“但是，”后来她又对科林说，“我控制不住自己。它自己爆发出来的，因为我突然想起你吃掉的最后一个大土豆，还有你咬那厚厚的可爱的面包皮时张大嘴的样子，上面还涂了果酱和凝脂奶油呢。”","“But,” she said afterward to Colin, “I couldn’t stop myself.It just burst out because all at once I couldn’t help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.”"
"“孩子们有没有办法偷偷弄到吃的？”克雷文医生问梅德洛克太太。","“Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?”Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock."
"“不可能，除非他们从地里挖，从树上摘，”梅德洛克太太回答说，“他们整天呆在园子里，除了对方谁也见不到。如果他们想吃些和平时送去的不一样的东西，他们只要说一声就行。”","“There’s no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees,” Mrs. Medlock answered.“They stay out in the grounds all day and see no one but each other.And if they want anything different to eat from what’s sent up to them they need only ask for it.”"
"“哦，”克雷文医生说，“要是他们不吃东西也没什么不舒服，我们就别插手了。这男孩已经脱胎换骨了。”","“Well,” said Dr. Craven, “so long as going without food agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves.The boy is a new creature.”"
"“那姑娘也是，”梅德洛克太太说，“她绝对开始变漂亮了，因为她长胖了，那副难看的刻薄的表情也消失了。她的头发变密了，看上去很健康，她的气色也变好了。以前她是个再阴沉不过的、怪脾气的小家伙，现在她和科林少爷一起有说有笑，就像一对小疯子。也许他们就是这样长胖的。”","“So is the girl,” said Mrs. Medlock.“She’s begun to be downright pretty since she’s filled out and lost her ugly little sour look.Her hair’s grown thick and healthy looking and she’s got a bright color.The glummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and Master Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones.Perhaps they’re growing fat on that.”"
"“也许是吧，”克雷文医生说，“让他们笑吧。”","“Perhaps they are,” said Dr. Craven.“Let them laugh.”"
"第二十五章 帘幕","CHAPTER XXV THE CURTAIN"
"秘密花园百花齐放，每个早晨都会出现新的奇迹。知更鸟的巢里有鸟蛋，知更鸟的媳妇坐在鸟蛋上，用胸口的羽毛和翅膀小心翼翼地为它们保暖。刚开始它很紧张，知更鸟自己也非常警觉。那几天，就连迪肯都没有走近那个枝叶遮蔽的角落，他一直等着，直到他借助某种神奇的沉默的力量向这一对小家伙的灵魂传达了这样的讯息：在这个花园里，没有不同于它们的东西——没有谁不知道它们身上正发生着怎样奇妙的事情——它们的鸟蛋拥有深不可测的、柔和的、登峰造极的、让人心碎的美丽和庄严。花园里只要有一个人没有在心灵深处体会到这样的道理：只要有一个鸟蛋被拿走或是被伤害，整个世界将天旋地转，天崩地裂，并就此终结——只要有一个人没有体会到，那么，即使是在这样的金色春光里，幸福也荡然无存。但是，所有的人都明白，也能体会到，而且知更鸟和它的媳妇对这一点也心知肚明。","And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles.In the robin’s nest there were Eggs and the robin’s mate sat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and careful wings.At first she was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly watchful.Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown corner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves—nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them—the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs.If there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end—if there had been even one who did not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air.But they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his mate knew they knew it."
"起初，知更鸟满怀焦虑地看着玛丽和科林。出于某种神秘的理由，它知道它没有必要盯着迪肯。它第一次用露珠般晶亮的黑眼睛看着迪肯时，它就知道迪肯不是陌生人，而是一种没长喙和羽毛的知更鸟。他可以讲知更鸟的语言（这种语言与其他语言大相径庭，不会搞混）。对知更鸟讲知更鸟的语言，就如同对一个法国人讲法语。迪肯总是用这种语言同知更鸟说话，所以，它和人类讲话时的那番胡言乱语此刻完全无关紧要。知更鸟觉得，它对人类说的话显得莫名其妙，是因为人类不够聪明，听不懂长羽毛的动物的话。它的动作也是知更鸟式的。它们从来不作什么突然的带有危险性或威胁性的举动来吓人。每只知更鸟都能理解迪肯，所以，迪肯在场一点都不会打扰它们。","At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety.For some mysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon.The first moment he set his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers.He could speak robin (which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other).To speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman.Dickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least.The robin thought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech.His movements also were robin.They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening.Any robin could understand Dickon, so his presence was not even disturbing."
"但是刚开始时，似乎要防着另外两个人。首先，那男孩不是自己走进花园的。他是坐在一个带轮子的东西上被推进来的，他身上还盖着什么野生动物的皮毛。这一点本身就很可疑。其次，他开始站起来四处走动时，方式怪异得很，其他人好像还要帮着他。知更鸟经常悄悄躲在灌木丛里紧张地监视着，脑袋一会儿偏向这一边，一会儿又偏向那一边。它觉得他行动缓慢是因为他正酝酿着一次突袭，就像猫一样。猫准备猛扑上前的时候，都要先非常缓慢地伏到地上。有好几天知更鸟都在跟它的媳妇说这事儿，但后来它决定还是不提它了，因为她太害怕了，知更鸟担心会伤到它们的蛋。","But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two.In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his legs.He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him.That in itself was doubtful.Then when he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him.The robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head tilted first on one side and then on the other.He thought that the slow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do.When cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly.The robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few days but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs."
"看到那男孩开始自己走，而且越走越快之后，知更鸟觉得大大解脱了。但是在很长一段时间内——或者说，对知更鸟来说看似是很长一段时间——那男孩是紧张的源头。他和别人的举止不一样。他看似很喜欢走动，但是他会不时地坐下或躺下一阵子，然后又手忙脚乱地站起来继续走。","When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief.But for a long time—or it seemed a long time to the robin—he was a source of some anxiety.He did not act as the other humans did.He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again."
"一天，知更鸟想起自己向父母学习飞翔时的情景，那时他也干过类似的事情。他飞了几码就不得不歇会儿。所以，他突然想到，这男孩正在学着飞——或者是在学走路。他把这事情告诉了他媳妇，说等小鸟破壳而出后，它们也会有这样的经历，她听了大感安慰，甚至兴趣大增，开始以探在鸟巢边上观察男孩为乐——不过她总觉得小鸟会聪明得多，学起来也快得多。不过随后她又宽容地说，人类总是要比鸟愚笨一些，迟钝一些，大多数人好像从来都学不会怎么飞。你可从来不会在天上或树梢上碰到他们。","One day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing.He had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest.So it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly—or rather to walk.He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were fledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her nest—though she always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and learn more quickly.But then she said indulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn to fly at all.You never met them in the air or on tree-tops."
"过了一会儿，那男孩开始像其他人一样四处走动，但三个孩子都会时不时做些与众不同的事。他们站在树下，晃动着胳膊、腿和脑袋，这不是走路的姿势，不是奔跑的姿势，也不是坐姿。他们每天间歇都会把这些动作做上一遍，知更鸟从来没法向媳妇解释他们在干什么，或者想干什么。他只能说，小鸟们肯定不会那样飞，但是，那个能讲一口流利的知更鸟语的男孩也参与其中，鸟儿们就能确信他们的行为没什么危险。当然，知更鸟和他的媳妇都没听说过摔跤冠军鲍勃•霍沃思，也没听说过他的锻炼肌肉的方法。知更鸟和人类不一样；它们从一开始就在锻炼肌肉，所以，它们生长的方式非常自然。如果你也是每一餐都得飞来飞去觅食，你的肌肉自然不会萎缩。","After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all three of the children at times did unusual things.They would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down.They went through these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never able to explain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do.He could only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in such a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions were not of a dangerous nature.Of course neither the robin nor his mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his exercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps.Robins are not like human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural manner.If you have to fly about to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied (atrophied means wasted away through want of use)."
"那个男孩能像其他人一样跑跳、挖地和除草的时候，角落里的鸟巢正笼罩在一片平静和满足之中。为鸟蛋担心已成为过去的事了。知道了自己的鸟蛋像锁进了银行保险柜里一样安全，而且又能看到那么多有趣的事，孵蛋便成了一桩趣事。下雨的时候，鸟妈妈有时会觉得有些无聊，因为孩子们没有来花园。","When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content.Fears for the Eggs became things of the past.Knowing that your Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a most entertaining occupation.On wet days the Eggs’ mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come into the garden."
"但就算是雨天，玛丽和科林也不会觉得无聊。一天早晨，雨下个不停，科林开始有些耐不住了，他被迫在沙发上呆着，因为起来到处走动不安全，而玛丽有了一个主意。","But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were dull.One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was beginning to feel a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on his sofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an inspiration."
"“现在我是个真正的男孩了，”科林曾这样说，“我的腿、胳膊和整个身体里都充满了魔法，我没法让它们静下来。它们总是闲不住。你知道么，玛丽，每天早晨我醒过来，天还很早，鸟儿在外头叫着，所有的东西都好像在快乐地叫着——连同树和我们听不到的东西在内——我就觉得我应该跳下床，自己也放声大喊。如果我那样做了，想想看结果会怎样！”　　玛丽咯咯笑个不停。","“Now that I am a real boy,” Colin had said, “my legs and arms and all my body are so full of Magic that I can’t keep them still.They want to be doing things all the time.Do you know that when I waken in the morning, Mary, when it’s quite early and the birds are just shouting outside and everything seems just shouting for joy—even the trees and things we can’t really hear—I feel as if I must jump out of bed and shout myself.If I did it, just think what would happen!”Mary giggled inordinately."
"“护士会跑进来，梅德洛克太太也会跑进来，他们肯定觉得你疯了，于是就会去请医生。”她说。","“The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and they would be sure you had gone crazy and they’d send for the doctor,” she said."
"科林自己也咯咯笑起来。他可以预见他们会是什么样子——他突然发作会吓坏他们，他站得笔直又会让他们大为震惊。","Colin giggled himself.He could see how they would all look—how horrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright."
"“真希望爸爸能回家，”他说，“我想亲自告诉他。我总是在想这事——但是，我们一直这么下去也不行啊。我受不了一动不动地躺着装样子了，而且，我变化太大了。希望今天没下雨。”","“I wish my father would come home,” he said.“I want to tell him myself.I’m always thinking about it—but we couldn’t go on like this much longer.I can’t stand lying still and pretending, and besides I look too different.I wish it wasn’t raining today.”"
"玛丽就是在这时想出主意的。","It was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration."
"“科林，”她神秘的开了腔，“这房子里有多少房间？”","“Colin,” she began mysteriously, “do you know how many rooms there are in this house?”"
"“我觉得差不多有一千。”他答道。","“About a thousand, I suppose,” he answered."
"“大概有一百间房间没人进去过，”玛丽说，　“有个下雨天，我进去看了好多间。没人知道，不过我差点被梅德洛克太太发现。回来的时候我迷了路，在你的走廊尽头停下来了。那是我第二次听到你哭。”","“There’s about a hundred no one ever goes into,” said Mary.“And one rainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them.No one ever knew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out.I lost my way when I was coming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor.That was the second time I heard you crying.”"
"科林从沙发上坐了起来。","Colin started up on his sofa."
"“一百间没人进过得房间，”他说，“听起来就像个秘密花园。我们能不能进去看看。用轮椅推着我，谁也不会知道我们去了。”","“A hundred rooms no one goes into,” he said.“It sounds almost like a secret garden.Suppose we go and look at them.Wheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went.”"
"“我正是这么想的，”玛丽说，“没人敢跟着我们。你可以在画廊里跑来跑去。我们可以锻炼。还有个印度小房间，壁橱里满是象牙做的大象。什么样的房间都有。”","“That’s what I was thinking,” said Mary.“No one would dare to follow us.There are galleries where you could run.We could do our exercises.There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants.There are all sorts of rooms.”"
"“按铃。”科林说。","“Ring the bell,” said Colin."
"护士进来后，科林下了命令。","When the nurse came in he gave his orders."
"“我要我的轮椅，”他说，“玛丽小姐和我打算去看看这房子里闲置着的部分。约翰可以把我推到画廊那儿，因为那里有楼梯。然后他必须离开，让我们单独呆着，直到我再叫他。”","“I want my chair,” he said.“Miss Mary and I are going to look at the part of the house which is not used.John can push me as far as the picture-gallery because there are some stairs.Then he must go away and leave us alone until I send for him again.”"
"那天早晨，雨天也不再可怕了。脚夫按吩咐将轮椅推到画廊，留那两人在一起时，科林和玛丽开心地对望着。玛丽确认约翰已经朝楼下他自己的住处走去之后，科林离开了轮椅。","Rainy days lost their terrors that morning.When the footman had wheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in obedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted.As soon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to his own quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair."
"“我要从画廊的这一头跑到那一头，”他说，“然后我要跳几下，再做鲍勃•霍沃斯的锻炼操。”","“I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,” he said, “and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth’s exercises.”"
"所有这些他们都一一执行，还做了很多别的事。他们看了画像，发现有个长相平平的小姑娘，穿着绿色的缎子衣服，她手指上站着一只鹦鹉。","And they did all these things and many others.They looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her finger."
"“这些人，”科林说，“一定都是我的亲戚。他们是很久之前的人了。那个带着鹦鹉的，我觉得她是我的一个曾、曾、曾祖姨母。她看上去和你挺像的，玛丽——不是像你现在的样子，而是像你刚来那会儿。你现在胖多了，也好看多了。”","“All these,” said Colin, “must be my relations.They lived a long time ago.That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, great aunts.She looks rather like you, Mary—not as you look now but as you looked when you came here.Now you are a great deal fatter and better looking.”"
"“你也是。”玛丽说完，两人都笑起来。","“So are you,” said Mary, and they both laughed."
"他们去了印度房间，玩象牙大象玩得不亦乐乎。他们还找到了那个玫瑰色的闺房，靠垫上还留着老鼠的洞，但老鼠长大了，跑了，剩下个空着的洞。比起玛丽的第一次朝圣之旅，这一次他们进了更多的房间，有了更多的发现。他们发现了新的走廊、角落、楼梯和他们喜欢的旧图画，还有一些不知用途的古怪旧物。那是个奇妙愉快的早晨，和其他人同在一所房子里走动，但同时又觉得与别人相隔千里，这种感觉引人入胜。","They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants.They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty.They saw more rooms and made more discoveries than Mary had made on her first pilgrimage.They found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and weird old things they did not know the use of.It was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same house with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were miles away from them was a fascinating thing."
"“真高兴我们来了这儿，”科林说，　　“我从来都不知道，原来我住的地方这么大，这么奇怪，又这么古老。我喜欢这里。以后每个雨天我们都来逛逛。我们一定总能找到新鲜的地方和奇特的玩意儿。”　　那天早上，他们胃口也很好，回到科林的房间后，午餐已经不可能原封不动地送回去了。","“I’m glad we came,” Colin said.“I never knew I lived in such a big queer old place.I like it.We will ramble about every rainy day.We shall always be finding new queer corners and things.”That morning they had found among other things such good appetites that when they returned to Colin’s room it was not possible to send the luncheon away untouched."
"护士把托盘拿到楼下，放到厨房的餐柜上，好让厨师卢米斯太太瞧瞧这干干净净的碗碟。","When the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she slapped it down on the kitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly polished dishes and plates."
"“瞧瞧！”她说，“这屋子真神了，那两个孩子是这屋子里最神奇的。”","“Look at that!” she said.“This is a house of mystery, and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it.”"
"“要是他们每天都这样，”年轻力壮的脚夫约翰说，“他的体重无疑会是一个月前的两倍。我得尽快辞了这份工作，我怕肌肉会受伤。”","“If they keep that up every day,” said the strong young footman John, “there’d be small wonder that he weighs twice as much to-day as he did a month ago.I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doing my muscles an injury.”"
"那天下午，玛丽发觉科林房间里有了些许变化。她昨天就注意到了，但她什么也没说，因为她以为那是个偶然的变化。今天她也没说什么，但是她坐在那儿盯着炉台上的画看。她可以看到那幅画，因为帘子已经拉开了。这就是她发现的变化。","That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin’s room.She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because she thought the change might have been made by chance.She said nothing today but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.She could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside.That was the change she noticed."
"“我知道你想要我告诉你什么，”玛丽看了几分钟之后，科林说，“你想要我告诉你事情的时候，我总能觉察。你正纳闷帘子怎么拉开了。我要让它保持这个状态。”","“I know what you want me to tell you,” said Colin, after she had stared a few minutes.“I always know when you want me to tell you something.You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back.I am going to keep it like that.”"
"“为什么？”玛丽问。","“Why?” asked Mary."
"“因为看到她笑我也不生气了。两天前，晚上我醒过来，月光很明亮，我感到整个房间里满是魔法，一切都变得那么辉煌，我可没法静静躺着了。我起身朝窗外看。房间很亮堂，帘子上有一片月光，这引得我过去拉了绳子。她正好俯视着我，她好像是为我站在那儿感到高兴才笑的。所以我喜欢看她了。我希望时时刻刻都能看到那样的笑容。我觉得她以前很可能是个有魔法的人。”","“Because it doesn’t make me angry any more to see her laughing.I wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the Magic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I couldn’t lie still.I got up and looked out of the window.The room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord.She looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there.It made me like to look at her.I want to see her laughing like that all the time.I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.”"
"“现在你跟她好像啊，”玛丽说，“有时我觉得，你也许是她的灵魂，化成了男孩。“","“You are so like her now,” said Mary, “that sometimes I think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy.”"
"这个念头打动了科林。他仔细想了想，然后才慢慢回答她。","That idea seemed to impress Colin.He thought it over and then answered her slowly."
"“我要是她的灵魂——我爸爸就会喜欢我了。”","“If I were her ghost—my father would be fond of me.”"
"“你希望受到他的宠爱吗？”玛丽问。","“Do you want him to be fond of you?” inquired Mary."
"“以前我不希望，因为他不喜欢我。如果他会慢慢地喜欢我，我想我会告诉他关于魔法的事。这会让他更高兴的。”","“I used to hate it because he was not fond of me.If he grew fond of me I think I should tell him about the Magic.It might make him more cheerful.”"
"第二十六章 “是妈妈！”","CHAPTER XXVI “IT’S MOTHER!”"
"他们对魔法的信念是持久的。每天早晨念过咒语之后，科林有时会举行魔法讲座。","Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing.After the morning’s incantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures."
"“我喜欢办讲座，”他解释说，“是因为等我长大成了，有了伟大的科学发现，肯定是要为这些发现做讲座的，所以，现在就是演习。目前我只能做些简短的讲座，因为我太年轻了，另外，本•韦瑟斯塔夫会觉得自己在教堂里，他会昏昏欲睡。”","“I like to do it,” he explained, “because when I grow up and make great scientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise.I can only give short lectures now because I am very young, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church and he would go to sleep.”"
"“讲座的最大好处，”本说，“就是能让人站起来，爱说什么说什么，别人不能反驳。什么时候我自己也来开开讲座，我倒不介意。”","“Th’ best thing about lecturin’,” said Ben, “is that a chap can get up an’ say aught he pleases an’ no other chap can answer him back.I wouldn’t be agen’ lecturin’ a bit mysel’ sometimes.”"
"不过，当科林在他的树下发表高谈阔论时，本就会把他如饥似渴的目光定在他身上，不会移开。他望着科林时挑剔而又欣赏。讲座本身并不如何吸引他，真正吸引住他的，是科林那越来越直，越来越有力的双腿，是那高昂着的男孩子气的脑袋，是那曾经尖瘦、干瘪而现在却变得丰满圆润的下巴和脸颊，还有他那双眼睛，那眼中的光彩与本记忆中的另一双眼睛一模一样。有时，科林感觉得到，本那热切的目光说明他被打动了，而科林很想知道本到底在想什么，有一次，本显得非常入神的时候，科林发问了。","But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes on him and kept them there.He looked him over with critical affection.It was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light he remembered in another pair.Sometimes when Colin felt Ben’s earnest gaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him."
"“你在想什么，本•韦瑟斯塔夫？”他问。","“What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?” he asked."
"“我在想，”本回答，“这一周你肯定长了三四磅。我在看你的小腿和肩膀。我真想把你放到天平上称称。”","“I was thinkin’” answered Ben, “as I’d warrant tha’s, gone up three or four pound this week.I was lookin’ at tha’ calves an’ tha’ shoulders.I’d like to get thee on a pair o’ scales.”"
"“多亏了魔法，还有——还有索尔比太太的面包牛奶还有其他东西，”科林说，“你看，科学实验成功了。”","“It’s the Magic and—and Mrs. Sowerby’s buns and milk and things,” said Colin.“You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.”"
"那天早晨，迪肯来迟了，没听到讲座。他是跑着来的，所以脸色红润，那有趣的脸蛋比平时更有光彩。刚下过雨，有很多草要除，所以他们开始埋头干活儿。每次一场暖雨彻彻底底地下过之后，他们总有很多活儿要干。水分对花有好处，对杂草同样也有好处，所以杂草的小叶片星星点点冒了出来，必须趁它们扎根之前把它们拔掉。这些天，科林除草除得跟其他人一样好，他还能一边干一边传道授业。“你劳动的时候，亲自劳动的时候，魔法效力最佳，”这天早晨他这么说，“你可以感觉到，它就在你的骨头和肌肉里。我打算读一些关于骨骼和肌肉的书，但我要写一本关于魔法的书。　我现在正在构思。我正不断地作出新的发现。”","That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture.When he came he was ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than usual.As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work.They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain.The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold.Colin was as good at weeding as any one in these days and he could lecture while he was doing it.“The Magic works best when you work, yourself,” he said this morning.“You can feel it in your bones and muscles.I am going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic.I am making it up now.I keep finding out things.”"
"说过之后没多久，他放下铲子站了起来。他沉默了一会儿，大家都看得出，他正构思讲座，和往常一样。当他放下铲子笔直地站起来时，玛丽和迪肯觉得他一定是突然生出了什么强烈的念头，所以才会那样做。他让身体伸展到了最大限度，欣喜地伸开双臂。他脸上光彩照人，那奇特的眼睛因为喜悦而睁大了。那一刻，他完完全全明白了什么。","It was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his trowel and stood up on his feet.He had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did.When he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it.He stretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly.Color glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness.All at once he had realized something to the full."
"“玛丽！迪肯！”他叫道，“看着我！”","“Mary! Dickon!” he cried. “Just look at me!”"
"他们停下了除草的活儿，向科林看去。","They stopped their weeding and looked at him."
"“你记得你第一次把我带到这里的那个早晨么？”他问。","“Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?” he demanded."
"迪肯正非常认真地看着他。作为一名驯兽师，迪肯能比其他人看出更多的东西，其中有很多是他从不会提起。现在，他已经在这个男孩身上看出一些来了。“啊，我们记得。”他答道。","Dickon was looking at him very hard.Being an animal charmer he could see more things than most people could and many of them were things he never talked about.He saw some of them now in this boy.“Aye, that we do,” he answered."
"玛丽也认真地看着他，但她什么也没说。","Mary looked hard too, but she said nothing."
"“就在刚才，”科林说，“我也突然记起来了——我看着自己那双握着铲子挖土的手——我得站起来看看这是不是真的。果然是真的！我好了——我好了！”","“Just this minute,” said Colin, “all at once I remembered it myself—when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel—and I had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real.And it is real!I’m well—I’m well!”"
"“啊，是啊！”迪肯说。","“Aye, that th’ art!” said Dickon."
"“我好了！我好了！”科林又重复了一遍，他的脸变得通红。","“I’m well! I’m well!” said Colin again, and his face went quite red all over."
"在这之前，他就已经多多少少知道了一些，他期待过，感觉过，思考过，但就在刚才，有什么东西骤然涌遍全身——那是一种令人狂喜的信念和意识，那么强烈，他控制不住要呼喊出声。","He had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and thought about it, but just at that minute something had rushed all through him—a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been so strong that he could not help calling out."
"“我会活到永远永远永远！·”他郑重地叫道，“我会有千千万万个发现。我要了解人、动物还有一切可以生长的东西——像迪肯那样——我永远不会放弃魔法。我好了！我好了！我觉得——我觉得我好想大叫——叫出我的感激和快乐！”","“I shall live forever and ever and ever!” he cried grandly.“I shall find out thousands and thousands of things.I shall find out about people and creatures and everything that grows—like Dickon—and I shall never stop making Magic.I’m well!I’m well!I feel—I feel as if I want to shout out something—something thankful, joyful!”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫正在一丛玫瑰附近忙乎，他转过头来瞟着他。","Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round at him."
"“你可以唱赞美诗啊。”他干巴巴地嘟哝着建议道。他并不了解赞美诗，也不是因为有什么特别的崇敬之情才这样建议的。","“Tha’ might sing th’ Doxology,” he suggested in his dryest grunt.He had no opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the suggestion with any particular reverence."
"但是科林就爱问个究竟，他对赞美诗一无所知。","But Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the Doxology."
"“那是什么？”他问道。","“What is that?” he inquired."
"“迪肯可以给你唱，我敢保证。”本•韦瑟斯塔夫答道。","“Dickon can sing it for thee, I’ll warrant,” replied Ben Weatherstaff."
"迪肯带着驯兽师的无所不知的微笑回了话。","Dickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer’s smile."
"“就是他们在教堂里唱的东西，”他说，“妈妈说，她觉得云雀早晨起来的时候唱的就是这个。”","“They sing it i’ church,” he said.“Mother says she believes th’ skylarks sings it when they gets up i’ th’ mornin’.”"
"“如果她那么说，那一定是好听的歌，”科林回答道，“我还从来没去过教堂呢。我总是病得太厉害。唱唱吧，迪肯。我想听听。”","“If she says that, it must be a nice song,” Colin answered.“I’ve never been in a church myself.I was always too ill.Sing it, Dickon.I want to hear it.”"
"迪肯唱赞美诗时纯朴而自然。他能比科林自己更好地理解他的感受。他靠一种直觉去理解，自然而然，连他自己都不知道，那就是理解。他摘下了帽子，微笑着环顾四周。","Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it.He understood what Colin felt better than Colin did himself.He understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding.He pulled off his cap and looked round still smiling."
"“你得摘下帽子，”他对科林说，“你也是，本——而且必须起立，这你知道的。”","“Tha’ must take off tha’ cap,” he said to Colin, “an’ so mun tha’, Ben—an’ tha’ mun stand up, tha’ knows.”"
"科林取下了帽子，阳光照射，温暖着他浓密的头发，他则是专注地看着迪肯。本•韦瑟斯塔夫手忙脚乱地爬起来，取下帽子，脸上带着一种困惑的、半含不满的表情，好像他不知道为什么要做这么一件非比寻常的事。","Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair as he watched Dickon intently.Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his knees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look on his old face as if he didn’t know exactly why he was doing this remarkable thing."
"迪肯站在树林和玫瑰从中开始唱诗，他的方式纯朴而自然，他那男孩的嗓音好听而有力：","Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in quite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:"
"“赞美上帝，万福之源，万物在下，称颂上帝，称颂他啊，至高真神，赞美父子圣灵。阿门。”","“Praise God from whom all blessings flow,Praise Him all creatures here below,Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host,Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.Amen.”"
"他唱完后，本•韦瑟斯塔夫一动不动地站着，下颌紧闭，眼睛却盯着科林，眼中带着困惑。科林脸上露出若有所思但赞赏的神情。","When he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with his jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed on Colin.Colin’s face was thoughtful and appreciative."
"“这首歌真好听，”他说，“我很喜欢。也许它道出了我想要呼出的心声，道出了我对魔法的感激。”他停了下来，困惑地思索着。　“也许它们两个是一回事。我们怎么能知道每样东西确切的名字？再唱一遍吧，迪肯。我们也试试，玛丽。我也想唱。这是我的歌。开头怎么唱的？‘赞美上帝，万福之源’？”","“It is a very nice song,” he said.“I like it.Perhaps it means just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.”He stopped and thought in a puzzled way.“Perhaps they are both the same thing.How can we know the exact names of everything?Sing it again, Dickon.Let us try, Mary.I want to sing it, too.It’s my song.How does it begin?‘Praise God from whom all blessings flow’?”"
"他们又唱了一遍，玛丽和科林尽量用悦耳的声音唱着，迪肯唱得很响很好听——他们唱到第二行时，本•韦瑟斯塔夫钝闷地清了清嗓子，唱到第三行时，他也加入了，他的声音太有活力了，都显得有些粗犷了，唱完“阿门”的时候，玛丽发现本的状况就跟他得知科林不是瘸子时一样——他的下巴在抽搐，眼睛瞪着、眨着，粗糙的脸颊湿润了。","And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as musically as they could and Dickon’s swelled quite loud and beautiful—and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared his throat and at the third line he joined in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when the “Amen” came to an end Mary observed that the very same thing had happened to him which had happened when he found out that Colin was not a cripple—his chin was twitching and he was staring and winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet."
"“以前我从没看出赞美诗有啥意义，”他沙哑地说，“但这回我改变看法了。我应该说，这周你长了五磅，科林少爷——五磅！”","“I never seed no sense in th’ Doxology afore,” he said hoarsely, “but I may change my mind i’ time.I should say tha’d gone up five pound this week Mester Colin—five on ‘em!”"
"科林正望着花园那头，他的注意力被什么东西吸引过去了，他脸上露出惊奇的表情。","Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting his attention and his expression had become a startled one."
"“谁进来了？”他快速地说，“是谁？”","“Who is coming in here?” he said quickly. “Who is it?”"
"常春藤遮盖的墙上，门被轻轻推开，一个女人已进入了园内。她是在他们唱到最后一行的时候进来的，她静静地站着，倾听着，注视着。常春藤在她身后，阳光透过树木照过来，在她的蓝色大衣上投下斑斑点点，她的面孔好看而年轻，带着笑容，透过绿荫看去，她就像科林书里的一幅色彩柔和的插图。她的一双妙目饱含深情，似乎将一切都看在了眼里——一切，甚至包括本•韦瑟斯塔夫、“小家伙们”还有每一朵绽放的鲜花。她的出现出人意料，但没有谁把她认作是入侵者。迪肯的眼睛像灯一样亮起来。","The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered.She had come in with the last line of their song and she had stood still listening and looking at them.With the ivy behind her, the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak, and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored illustration in one of Colin’s books.She had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in—all of them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the “creatures” and every flower that was in bloom.Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them felt that she was an intruder at all.Dickon’s eyes lighted like lamps."
"“是妈妈——就是妈妈！”他一边叫一边跑着穿过草地。　　科林也向她走去，玛丽也随他一起过去了。他们都觉得自己的脉搏跳动加快了。","“It’s mother—that’s who it is!” he cried and went across the grass at a run.Colin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him.They both felt their pulses beat faster."
"“是妈妈！”半路汇合时，迪肯又重复道，“我知道你想见她，我就告诉她门藏在哪里。”","“It’s mother!”Dickon said again when they met halfway.“I knowed tha’ wanted to see her an’ I told her where th’ door was hid.”"
"科林带着一种高贵的羞涩伸出手去，他脸红了，但是眼睛却盯着她的脸。　　“我生病的时候就很想见你了，”他说，“想见你和迪肯，还有秘密花园。在这之前，我从不想见任何人或任何东西。”","Colin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his eyes quite devoured her face.“Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,” he said, “you and Dickon and the secret garden.I’d never wanted to see any one or anything before.”"
"看到科林仰起的脸，她的脸也突然起了变化。她脸红了，嘴角颤动着，一层雾气蒙住了她的眼睛。","The sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her own.She flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her eyes."
"“啊！好孩子！”她突然叫道。“啊！好孩子！”好像她原本没打算这么说。她没说“科林少爷”，只是非常突然地叫他“好孩子”。要是迪肯脸上有什么东西触动了她，她也会对迪肯这么说。科林很喜欢这一点。","“Eh! dear lad!” she broke out tremulously.“Eh! dear lad!” as if she had not known she were going to say it.She did not say, “Mester Colin,” but just “dear lad” quite suddenly.She might have said it to Dickon in the same way if she had seen something in his face which touched her.Colin liked it."
"“我这么健康，你惊奇么？”科林问。她把手放到科林肩上，微笑着，眼中的雾气散去了。“是啊，我很惊奇！”她说，“但你和你妈妈太像了，这让我的心直跳。”","“Are you surprised because I am so well?” he asked.She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.“Aye, that I am!” she said; “but tha’rt so like thy mother tha’ made my heart jump.”"
"“你觉不觉得，”科林有些不自在地说，“这会让我爸爸喜欢我？”","“Do you think,” said Colin a little awkwardly, “that will make my father like me?”"
"“啊，那当然，好孩子，”她一边回答一边迅速在科林肩上轻轻一拍，“他一定要回家——他一定要回家。”","“Aye, for sure, dear lad,” she answered and she gave his shoulder a soft quick pat.“He mun come home—he mun come home.”"
"“苏珊•索尔比，”本•韦瑟斯塔夫走到她近旁说，“你看看这孩子的腿好么？两个月前它们还像是装在袜子里的一对鼓槌——我还听人说他又是罗圈腿又是八字脚。现在，瞧瞧啊！”","“Susan Sowerby,” said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her.“Look at th’ lad’s legs, wilt tha’?They was like drumsticks i’ stockin’ two month’ ago—an’ I heard folk tell as they was bandy an’ knock-kneed both at th’ same time.Look at ‘em now!”"
"苏珊•索尔比舒心地笑起来。","Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh."
"“过不了多久它们就会和其他年轻人一样有力了，”她说，“让他接着在花园里玩耍、干活，吃得丰盛些，多喝些上好的甜美的牛奶，他的腿就会长成全约克郡第一，感谢上帝。”","“They’re goin’ to be fine strong lad’s legs in a bit,” she said.“Let him go on playin’ an’ workin’ in the garden an’ eatin’ hearty an’ drinkin’ plenty o’ good sweet milk an’ there’ll not be a finer pair i’ Yorkshire, thank God for it.”"
"她把两只手放到玛丽小姐的肩上，像母亲看孩子那样看着她的小脸。","She put both hands on Mistress Mary’s shoulders and looked her little face over in a motherly fashion."
"“你也是！”她说，“你快要和我们家伊丽莎白•埃伦一样健康了。我保证你也会像你妈妈一样。我们家玛莎告诉我，梅德洛克太太听说她是个漂亮的女人。你长大了会像朵红玫瑰一样，我的姑娘，上帝保佑你。”","“An’ thee, too!” she said.“Tha’rt grown near as hearty as our ‘Lisabeth Ellen.I’ll warrant tha’rt like thy mother too.Our Martha told me as Mrs. Medlock heard she was a pretty woman.Tha’lt be like a blush rose when tha’ grows up, my little lass, bless thee.”"
"但她没有提起，玛莎“休息日”回到家，说玛丽长相平平，脸色灰黄，她说她不相信梅德洛克太太所听说的。“一个漂亮的女人怎么可能有这么个难看的女儿，没道理啊。”她曾坚决地补充。","She did not mention that when Martha came home on her “day out” and described the plain sallow child she had said that she had no confidence whatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard.“It doesn’t stand to reason that a pretty woman could be th’ mother o’ such a fou’ little lass,” she had added obstinately."
"玛丽没功夫去注意自己的脸起了什么变化。她只知道她看上去“不一样”了，而且好像头发多了很多，长得很快。但是想起过去看到太太有多么快乐，她便很乐意听人说有一天自己会像她。","Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face.She had only known that she looked “different” and seemed to have a great deal more hair and that it was growing very fast.But remembering her pleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she was glad to hear that she might some day look like her."
"苏珊•索尔比和他们一起绕着花园走了一圈，听了整个故事，也看到了重现生机的每一丛灌木，每一棵树。科林走在他一侧，玛丽在另一侧。每个人都不断仰起头看她那自然的玫瑰色脸庞，暗自对她带来的愉悦之感感到好奇——那是一种温暖的、被支持的感觉。她理解他们，就像迪肯理解他的“小家伙们”一样。她在花前俯下身，把花朵当作孩子谈论着。煤烟跟在她后面，朝她叫了一两声，又飞上了她的肩头，好像她是迪肯一样。他们还告诉了她知更鸟的事，还有小鸟第一次练飞，她发出了母亲般的醇和的笑声。","Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive.Colin walked on one side of her and Mary on the other.Each of them kept looking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the delightful feeling she gave them—a sort of warm, supported feeling.It seemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his “creatures.”She stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were children.Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew upon her shoulder as if it were Dickon’s.When they told her about the robin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her throat."
"“我猜想，教小鸟飞就像教小孩子走路一样，不过，要是我的孩子长的是翅膀而不是腿，我觉得我会担心的。”她说。","“I suppose learnin’ ‘em to fly is like learnin’ children to walk, but I’m feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o’ legs,” she said."
"因为她是那样一个好心的女人，旷野农家的行事风格很得人心，所以，最后他们把魔法的事也告诉了她。","It was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorland cottage way that at last she was told about the Magic."
"“你相信魔法吗？”解释完印度魔法师，科林说，“希望你相信。”","“Do you believe in Magic?” asked Colin after he had explained about Indian fakirs. “I do hope you do.”"
"“我相信，孩子，”她回答，“我从来不知道它的名字，但名字算什么呢？我保证，它在法国、德国的名字都不一样。但让种子成长，让阳光照耀，让你康复的东西是同一个，那是有益的东西。它和我们这些凡夫俗子不一样，不会觉得叫个名字有多大关系。那至善之物一直都在关心着我们，保佑着我们。它不停地创造出千千万万个世界——像我们这样的世界。你们要永远相信那个至善之物，要知道它已充满了整个世界——怎么称呼它随你的便。我进花园时，你们正对它唱歌呢。”","“That I do, lad,” she answered.“I never knowed it by that name but what does th’ name matter?I warrant they call it a different name i’ France an’ a different one i’ Germany.Th’ same thing as set th’ seeds swellin’ an’ th’ sun shinin’ made thee a well lad an’ it’s th’ Good Thing.It isn’t like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of our names.Th’ Big Good Thing doesn’t stop to worrit, bless thee.It goes on makin’ worlds by th’ million—worlds like us.Never thee stop believin’ in th’ Big Good Thing an’ knowin’ th’ world’s full of it—an’ call it what tha’ likes.Tha’ wert singin’ to it when I come into th’ garden.”"
"“我觉得好快乐，”科林对她睁开漂亮奇特的眼睛，　“突然之间，我感觉到自己和从前多么不同——我的手臂和腿都那样有力，你知道——我可以挖土，可以站起来——我还可以蹦跳，我想大声叫出来，谁乐意听我就叫给谁听。”","“I felt so joyful,” said Colin, opening his beautiful strange eyes at her.“Suddenly I felt how different I was—how strong my arms and legs were, you know—and how I could dig and stand—and I jumped up and wanted to shout out something to anything that would listen.”"
"“你们唱赞美诗的时候，魔法听着呢。不管你唱了什么，它都会听。关键是要快乐。啊！孩子，孩子——我们管那制造欢乐的叫什么呢，”她又轻快地拍了拍迪肯的肩膀。","“Th’ Magic listened when tha’ sung th’ Doxology.It would ha’ listened to anything tha’d sung.It was th’ joy that mattered.Eh! lad, lad—what’s names to th’ Joy Maker,” and she gave his shoulders a quick soft pat again."
"今天早晨，她按常规准备了一篮子的食物，孩子们感到饥饿的时候，迪肯就把吃的从它的藏身之处取出到大家狼吞虎咽地吃下食物，她笑起来，为他们的好胃口感到高兴。她是个有趣的人，会用各种趣怪的笑料逗得大家大笑不已。她用浓重的约克郡口音给他们讲故事，还教他们新的词汇。他们告诉她，科林要装成个烦躁不安的病人越来越困难了，她便大笑起来，好像忍都忍不住。","She had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and when the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding place, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour their food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites.She was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things.She told them stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words.She laughed as if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful invalid."
"“你瞧，我们在一起的时候经常忍不住哈哈大笑，”科林解释说，“这听上去一点都不像是生病的样子。我们试着把笑给憋回去，但还是会爆发出来，这就更糟了。”","“You see we can’t help laughing nearly all the time when we are together,” explained Colin.“And it doesn’t sound ill at all.We try to choke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.”"
"“我经常会想起一件事，”玛丽说，“每次突然想起它，我就忍不住要笑。我一直在想象着科林的脸长成个圆圆的月亮。现在还不像，但他每天都长胖一点——所以哪天早晨，就真的像月亮了——那时我们该怎么办啊！”","“There’s one thing that comes into my mind so often,” said Mary, “and I can scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly.I keep thinking suppose Colin’s face should get to look like a full moon.It isn’t like one yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day—and suppose some morning it should look like one—what should we do!”"
"“保佑所有人，我知道你们还有好多戏要演，”苏珊•索尔比说，“但你们不用演多久了。克雷文老爷快要回家了。”","“Bless us all, I can see tha’ has a good bit o’ play actin’ to do,” said Susan Sowerby.“But tha’ won’t have to keep it up much longer.Mester Craven’ll come home.”"
"“你觉得他会么？”科林文，“为什么呢？”","“Do you think he will?” asked Colin. “Why?”"
"苏珊•索尔比轻声笑起来。","Susan Sowerby chuckled softly."
"“我想，要是在你亲自告诉他之前他就知道了的话，你的心都要碎了。你好几个晚上都在筹划这事，都没睡着呢。”","“I suppose it ‘ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha’ told him in tha’ own way,” she said.“Tha’s laid awake nights plannin’ it.”"
"“我受不了由别人去告诉他，”科林说，“我每天都在想着不同的方式，现在，我想要跑着进他的房间。”“对他来说这是个好的开头，”苏珊•索尔比说，“我好想看看他的脸，孩子。我真的很想！他一定要回来——一定。”","“I couldn’t bear any one else to tell him,” said Colin.“I think about different ways every day, I think now I just want to run into his room.”“That’d be a fine start for him,” said Susan Sowerby.“I’d like to see his face, lad.I would that!He mun come back—that he mun.”"
"随后他们讨论的事情之一就是去拜访她的农舍。他们全都计划好了。他们要坐车穿过原野，在户外的石南丛里吃午餐。他们要见见那十二个孩子，还有迪肯的花园，不玩到累就不回来。","One of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to her cottage.They planned it all.They were to drive over the moor and lunch out of doors among the heather.They would see all the twelve children and Dickon’s garden and would not come back until they were tired."
"最后，苏珊•索尔比站了起来，她要赶回房子里，赶回梅德洛克太太那儿。也到了把科林推回去的时候了。坐进轮椅之前，科林站得离苏珊很近，他双眼盯着她瞧，眼中带着一种说不清的崇拜，突然，他紧紧地抓住了她蓝色的大衣。","Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock.It was time for Colin to be wheeled back also.But before he got into his chair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with a kind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold of her blue cloak and held it fast."
"“你就是——就是我想要的，”他说，“我真希望你是我妈妈——也是迪肯的！”","“You are just what I—what I wanted,” he said.“I wish you were my mother—as well as Dickon’s!”"
"苏珊•索尔比立刻弯下腰去，用温暖的臂膀把他搂到怀里，让他靠着蓝色大衣下的胸口——好像他是迪肯的兄弟。那层雾气很快地蒙上了她的眼睛。","All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm arms close against the bosom under the blue cloak—as if he had been Dickon’s brother.The quick mist swept over her eyes."
"“啊！好孩子！”她说，“我相信你自己的妈妈就在这个花园里。她离不开这里。你的爸爸一定会回来找你的——他一定会的！”","“Eh! dear lad!” she said.“Thy own mother’s in this ‘ere very garden, I do believe.She couldna’ keep out of it.Thy father mun come back to thee—he mun!”"
"第二十七章 在花园里","CHAPTER XXVII IN THE GARDEN"
"自世界起始，每个世纪都有奇妙的发现。而上个世纪的奇妙发现则比过去的任何世纪都多。在这个世纪，无数更惊人的发现将会诞生。起初，人们不相信一件新奇的事情能够成功，随后，他们又希望可以成功，接着，他们见证了成功——最后，果然成功了，而整个世界便纳闷为什么一个世纪之前这件事情无法办到。上个世纪人们开始发现的事情之一，就是思想——仅仅是思想本身——和电池一样有力——像阳光一样有益于人，却也像毒药一样有害于人。让一个悲伤的或是不良的念头进入你心里，就像是让猩红热病菌进入你体内一样危险。如果它进来之后你就任它留下，那么你这辈子都无法恢复。","In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have been discovered.In the last century more amazing things were found out than in any century before.In this new century hundreds of things still more astounding will be brought to light.At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done—then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.One of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts—just mere thoughts—are as powerful as electric batteries—as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.To let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body.If you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live."
"玛丽小姐曾经满脑子都是不愉快的念头，包括她不喜欢的人、她对别人的刻薄的看法还有不被任何东西所取悦、所吸引的决心，所以那时她是个脸色发黄，病病歪歪，无聊可怜的孩子。但是，老天待她不薄，尽管她自己还全然不知。她开始受到推动，这对她有好处。渐渐地，她的脑子里出现了知更鸟、旷野上挤满了孩子的农舍、古怪暴躁的老花匠、约克郡的普通小女仆、春日时光、一天天复苏的秘密花园还有旷野上的男孩以及他的“小家伙们”，她脑子里已经装不下那些曾经让她伤肝、消化不良、脸色发黄且倦怠的坏念头了。","So long as Mistress Mary’s mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child.Circumstances, however, were very kind to her, though she was not at all aware of it.They began to push her about for her own good.When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boy and his “creatures,” there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired."
"科林曾经把自己关在房里，一心只想着自己的恐惧、虚弱和对看他的人的厌恶，每隔一段时间就想起驼背和早夭，那时，他就是个歇斯底里、疯疯癫癫的小疑心病患者，对阳光和春天一无所知，也不知道如果自己愿意试试就可以康复，可以站起来。全新的美好的思绪开始将丑陋的就念头推开时，科林又有了生气，血液在他的血管里健康地流淌，力量就像食物一样注入他的体内。他的科学实验很实用，也很简单，根本没什么好奇怪的。如果谁能在不愉快的或者让人扫兴的念头出现时，依靠理智，借助愉快积极的思绪将它拒之门外，那么，这个人身上会有更加惊人的事情发生。这两中念头不能共处一室。　　“孩子，你在哪里种下玫瑰，哪里就长不出蓟草。”","So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it.When new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood.His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all.Much more surprising things can happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.Two things cannot be in one place.“Where, you tend a rose, my lad,A thistle cannot grow.”"
"秘密花园复苏，那两个孩子也跟着复苏之时，有一个人却徜徉在遥远而美丽的地方，在挪威的峡湾，在瑞士的山谷和山间，十年间，黑暗的、让人心碎的想法充斥着他的脑海。他不曾勇敢过；他从没试过要让别的想法取代那些黑暗的念头。在蓝盈盈的湖边散步时，他想着那些念头；躺在山上，深蓝色的龙胆花在他四周绽放，铺成一条地毯，空气里满溢鲜花的芳香时，他还在想那些念头。快乐的时候，一种可怕的悲伤情绪会突然降临，于是他便会让黑暗占据自己的灵魂，且固执地拒绝阳光透入，哪怕只是一丝一缕。他忘记了、抛弃了自己的家和自己的责任。他四处旅行时，黑暗也笼罩着他，别人都不想看到他，好像他的阴郁会让周围的空气都带上毒。大多数陌生人觉得，他要不就是半疯，要不灵魂中隐藏着什么罪行。 他是个高个子的男人，满脸憔悴，肩膀扭曲，他在旅馆登记时所用的名字一直是“阿奇博尔德•克雷文，米瑟斯韦特庄园，约克郡，英格兰。”","While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark and heart-broken thinking.He had not been courageous; he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark ones.He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them.A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.He had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties.When he traveled about, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom.Most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul.He, was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was, “Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.”"
"自从在书房里见到玛丽小姐，并告诉她她可以“要一点泥土”之后，他又到过了很多很遥远的地方。他曾去过欧洲最美的地方，但他在每个地方都呆不了几天。他去过最宁静最偏远的地方。他还登上过高耸入云的峰顶，俯瞰群山，太阳升起，光辉洒下时，整个世界好像刚刚诞生。","He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his study and told her she might have her “bit of earth.”He had been in the most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere more than a few days.He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots.He had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born."
"但是，阳光好像从没有洒落到他的身上，直到有一天，他十年来第一次意识到这一点时，一件奇怪的事情发生了。那时他正独自漫步在奥地利蒂罗尔州一个美丽的山谷里，这样的美景可以让任何人的灵魂脱离阴影。他已经走了很远，但还是没从阴影中摆脱。最后他累了，便坐在溪流边上如茵的苔藓上休息。那条小溪很清澈，它快乐地流淌在狭窄的河道里，所经之处是一片芳香湿润的绿色。有时，它冒着泡经过石头，就会发出一种声音，很像是轻笑。他看见鸟儿们飞来，将头浸入小溪中喝水，然后又拍打着翅膀飞走了。那条小溪就像是有生命的东西，但是它那微弱的声音让周围越发沉静。山谷非常非常安宁。","But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened.He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any man’s soul out of shadow.He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his.But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.It was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones.He saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away.It seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper.The valley was very, very still."
"阿奇博尔德•克雷文坐在那里凝视着溪水奔流，他觉得自己的身心都渐渐归于宁静，静得好像这山谷一样。他想着自己是不是困了，但他没困。他坐在那里凝视着洒满阳光的溪水，发现溪水边缘有什么东西正在生长。那是一株可爱的蓝色勿忘我，它离溪水很近，叶片被沾湿了，他发觉自己正注视着这些花朵，接着又想起多年以前，自己也曾注视着同样的东西。他满怀温柔地想，它是多么可爱啊，那千万朵蓝色小花是怎样的奇景啊。他没有意识到，这简单的想法正渐渐填充着他的心灵——填充着，填充着，直到其他的念头都被轻轻推到一边。这就好像一股甜美清冽的甘泉在一潭死水中渐渐涌出、涌出，最后，将黑水扫了个干净。但是，他自己当然没想到这一点。他只觉得，当他坐在那里凝视着那鲜亮细腻的蓝色花朵时，山谷好像变得越来越宁静了。他不知道自己在那里坐了多久，也不知道自己身上发生了什么事，但最后他动了动，好像刚刚醒来，然后，他慢慢起身，站在苔藓铺就的地毯上，长长地、深深地、轻轻地吸了一口气，对自己感到惊奇。他体内好像有东西正在静静地解开，释放。","As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven gradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself.He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.He sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growing at its edge.There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago.He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.He did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind—filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away.But of course he did not think of this himself.He only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness.He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening to him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself.Something seemed to have been unbound and released in him, very quietly."
"“那是什么？”他把手放在前额上轻声说，“我觉得我好像——活过来了！”","“What is it?” he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand over his forehead.“I almost feel as if—I were alive!”"
"我对未知事物的奇妙之处了解不深，所以无法解释他怎么会发生这样的事。到现在为止，也没有其他人可以解释。他对自己一点也不了解——但是，回到米瑟斯韦特后的好几个月，他都记着这奇妙的时刻，而且，就是在他回去的那一天，进入秘密花园时，他偶然发现科林喊道：　　“我会活到永远永远永远！”","I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to be able to explain how this had happened to him.Neither does any one else yet.He did not understand at all himself—but he remembered this strange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he found out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out as he went into the secret garden:“I am going to live forever and ever and ever!”"
"那一整夜，这非凡的平静都一直萦绕在他身边，他破天荒安稳地睡了一觉；可惜这种状态持续了没多久。他并不知道这状态是可以维持的。第二天晚上，他向那些黑暗的思绪敞开了大门，于是那些思绪又成群结队地涌了回来。他离开了山谷，继续游荡。但是，让他感到奇怪的是，有一段时间——大概是半小时——那黑暗的包袱在他不知不觉中又离开了他，他意识到自己是活着的，不是行尸走肉。渐渐地——渐渐地——无缘无故他就意识到——他正与花园一起“复苏”。","The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long.He did not know that it could be kept.By the next night he had opened the doors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back.He left the valley and went on his wandering way again.But, strange as it seemed to him, there were minutes—sometimes half-hours—when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.Slowly—slowly—for no reason that he knew of—he was “coming alive” with the garden."
"当金色的夏天变成了深金色的秋天，他去了科莫湖。在那里，他发现了梦的可爱之处。他在如水晶般湛蓝的湖边度日，或是重新回到山间那一片柔软浓密的翠绿色之中，徒步行走，直到感觉疲惫，可以入睡为止。但是这一回，他知道他的睡眠开始有了好转，他的梦也不再可怕。","As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the Lake of Como.There he found the loveliness of a dream.He spent his days upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he might sleep.But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he knew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him."
"“也许，”他想，“我的身体正在变强壮。”","“Perhaps,” he thought, “my body is growing stronger.”"
" 他的身体确实在变强壮，但是——因为在那些罕见的平静的时刻，他的想法改变了——他的灵魂也在渐渐强大。他开始想念米瑟斯韦特，开始考虑是不是应该回家了。他不时隐隐约约地想起自己的儿子，他问自己，再次站到那张雕花四柱床前，望着床上那张雕琢精细的、白如象牙的脸，望着那黑色睫毛镶在紧闭的双眼周围振颤着他的心灵时，会是怎样一种感觉。于是他退缩了。","It was growing stronger but—because of the rare peaceful hours when his thoughts were changed—his soul was slowly growing stronger, too.He began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.Now and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.He shrank from it."
"一天，他奇迹般地走出了很远，他返回时已是圆月高悬，整个世界里紫色影子和银辉交织着。宁静的湖泊、湖岸和树林是那样美妙，所以他没有回到他居住的别墅中去。他走向水边树荫下的一个小露台，在一个座位上坐下，呼吸着夜晚这迷人的芳香。他感觉到了那奇特的平静正在他身上悄悄弥漫，越来越强烈，直到他沉沉入睡。","One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon was high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver.The stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go into the villa he lived in.He walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water’s edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night.He felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep."
"他不知道自己是什么时候睡着的，也不知道梦是什么时候开始的；梦境太真实了，他根本意识不到自己是在做梦。事后他记得当时他以为自己很清醒，很警觉。他觉得，当他坐在那里呼吸着晚开的玫瑰花香，听着脚边水流拍打的声音，他听到了一个声音在呼唤。那声音甜美、清澈、快乐、遥远。那声音好像从远处传来，但他听得很分明，仿佛就在自己耳畔。　　“阿奇！阿奇！阿奇！”那声音叫道，随后又重复，比之前那次更加甜美，更加清澈，“阿奇！阿奇！”","He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his dream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming.He remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was.He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard a voice calling.It was sweet and clear and happy and far away.It seemed very far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very side.“Archie! Archie! Archie!” it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer than before, “Archie! Archie!”"
"他记得自己跳了起来，但并不吃惊。那声音那样真切，那样自然，所以他能听到。","He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled.It was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it."
"“莉里亚！莉里亚！”他回答道，“莉里亚！你在哪里？”","“Lilias! Lilias!” he answered.“Lilias! where are you?”"
"“在花园里，”那金笛般的声音传了回来，“在花园里！”","“In the garden,” it came back like a sound from a golden flute.“In the garden!”"
"接着，梦结束了。但是，他没有醒来。那整个美好的夜晚，他都睡得很沉很甜。他终于醒来时，天已大亮，一个仆人正站在那里盯着他。那仆人是意大利人，像宅子里所有的仆人一样，他也习惯了对他的外国主人的一切怪异之处全盘接受，不问任何问题。没人知道他什么时候会出门，什么时候会进来，他会在哪里睡觉，也没人知道他是不是会逛逛花园，或是整夜都躺在湖上的小船里。那仆人端着一个托盘，托盘里放着几封信，他正静静地等着克雷文先生将信拿起来。仆人走了之后，克雷文先生拿着信，坐在那里盯着湖面看了一会儿。那奇特的平静仍然萦绕在他周围，此外还有别的东西——一种轻松的感觉，仿佛曾经发生的残酷的事情都没有发生过——好像有什么东西发生了变化。他正在回忆那个梦——那个真实的——真实的梦。","And then the dream ended.But he did not awaken.He slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night.When he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him.He was an Italian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa were, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign master might do.No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night.The man held a salver with some letters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them.When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake.His strange calm was still upon him and something more—a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened as he thought—as if something had changed.He was remembering the dream—the real—real dream."
"“在花园里！”他兀自思索着说道，“在花园里！但门锁上了，钥匙也被深埋起来了。”","“In the garden!” he said, wondering at himself.“In the garden!But the door is locked and the key is buried deep.”"
"几分钟后，他瞥了一眼信件，发现最顶上的是一封英语信，从约克郡来的。　信封上平平无奇的笔迹出自一个女人之手，但他并不熟悉那笔迹。他拆开了信，还没来得及想写信人是谁，他的注意力就马上被第一行字吸引了。　　“亲爱的先生：","When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one lying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from Yorkshire.It was directed in a plain woman’s hand but it was not a hand he knew.He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the first words attracted his attention at once.“Dear Sir:"
"我是苏珊•索尔比，我曾在原野上冒昧和您交谈过。那次我说的是玛丽小姐的事情。现在，我要再次冒昧地开口。先生，求您，如果我是您，我一定会回家。我想，如果您回到家，一定会很高兴，而且——请您原谅，先生——我觉得，如果您夫人还在世，她也会请您回家。","I am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor.It was about Miss Mary I spoke.I will make bold to speak again.Please, sir, I would come home if I was you.I think you would be glad to come and—if you will excuse me, sir—I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here."
"您忠诚的仆人，苏珊•索尔比。”","Your obedient servant, Susan Sowerby.”"
"克雷文先生把这封信读了两遍，然后才将它塞回到信封里。他仍在想着他的梦。","Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.He kept thinking about the dream."
"“我要回米瑟斯韦特，”他说，“是的，我马上就回去。”","“I will go back to Misselthwaite,” he said.“Yes, I’ll go at once.”"
"他穿过花园，回到屋子里，吩咐皮切尔为他返回英格兰作好准备。","And he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to prepare for his return to England."
"几天之后，他又回到了约克郡，乘火车的途中，他发觉自己想起了儿子，过去十年间，他从未想过他。那几年里，他只希望自己能忘掉儿子。现在，虽然他并没有故意去想他，关于他的回忆却不断地涌入脑海。他记起那段黑暗的日子，那时他像个疯子一样胡言乱语，因为孩子还活着，但母亲却死了。他拒绝看去看儿子，最后虽然去看了，却见到那样一个虚弱、可怜的小东西，每个人都断定他活不了几天。但让照顾这孩子的人吃惊的是，时间一天天过去，他活了下来，但随后，每个人都觉得他会长成一个畸形的、跛脚的怪物。","In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad journey he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in all the ten years past.During those years he had only wished to forget him.Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories of him constantly drifted into his mind.He remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead.He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days.But to the surprise of those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature."
"他不是有意要做一个坏父亲的，但他一点都没有当父亲的感觉。他为他请了医生护士，让他过得奢华，但是，只要一想到这孩子，他就会退缩，用痛苦将自己埋没。他离开米瑟斯韦特一年后，第一次回去时，那可怜兮兮的小东西无精打采地、冷漠地抬起被黑色睫毛包围着的灰色大眼睛，那双眼睛和他所爱慕的那双快乐的眼睛如出一辙，却又判若霄壤，看到这双眼睛，他便不堪忍受，面如色灰地转身离去。从那以后，他很少去见儿子，除开他睡着的时候。他只知道那孩子肯定身有残疾，而且脾气暴躁，歇斯底里，疯疯癫癫。大发雷霆对他来说很危险，要想让他不发火，那只能事事顺着他。","He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father at all.He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his own misery.The first time after a year’s absence he returned to Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death.After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep, and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.He could only be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail."
"这些都不是什么振奋人心的回忆，但是，火车带着他穿过山路和金色的平原，这个“复苏”过来的男人开始用一种全新的方式思考，他思索了很长时间，想得很沉稳，很深远。","All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled him through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was “coming alive” began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and deeply."
"“也许，十年来我完全错了，”他自言自语道，“十年是很长的时间。也许一切都太迟了——实在太迟了。以前我到底是怎么想的！”","“Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,” he said to himself.“Ten years is a long time.It may be too late to do anything—quite too late.What have I been thinking of!”"
"当然，这是错误的魔法——一开始就说“太迟了”。连科林都能告诉他。但是，他对魔法一无所知——不论黑的白的。这个他还没学过。他寻思着，苏珊•索尔比鼓起勇气给他写信，是不是仅仅因为这个充满母性的人意识到那男孩的病情加重了——已经生命垂危了。若不是被那种神奇的平静咒语所影响，所占据，也许他会比以往更加消极。但是，那种平静带来了一种勇气和希望。他没有往最坏的方面想，恰恰相反，他正努力相信更好的东西。","Of course this was the wrong Magic—to begin by saying “too late.”Even Colin could have told him that.But he knew nothing of Magic—either black or white.This he had yet to learn.He wondered if Susan Sowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creature had realized that the boy was much worse—was fatally ill.If he had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him he would have been more wretched than ever.But the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.Instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in better things."
"“会不会是她发觉我可以帮助他，克制他？”他想，“回米瑟斯韦特时，我要顺道去看看她。”","“Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him good and control him?” he thought.“I will go and see her on my way to Misselthwaite.”"
"路过旷野时，他把马车停在农舍前，七八个孩子正在一起玩，见到他，每个人都友好而礼貌地行了屈膝礼，并告诉他，他们的妈妈一大早就去原野另一头一个刚生了孩子的女人家里帮忙了。 “我们的迪肯，”他们主动说，“在庄园里的一个花园里干活，他每个星期都去几天。”","But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the cottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a new baby.“Our Dickon,” they volunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where he went several days each week."
"克雷文先生看着这群结实的小家伙们，他们的圆脸红红的，每个人都颇具特色地咧嘴笑着，他觉得他们是一群健康喜人的孩子。他以一个微笑来回应他们友好的笑容，又从口袋里掏出一枚金币，递给“我们的‘伊丽莎白•埃伦’”，她是这群孩子当中最年长的。","Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot.He smiled at their friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and gave it to “our ‘Lizabeth Ellen” who was the oldest."
"“要是你们把它分成八份，每个人都会得到半克朗。”他说。","“If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for each of, you,” he said."
"随后，他就在欢笑声和屈膝礼中坐车离开了，留下狂喜的孩子们在身后互相推挤并快乐地蹦跳着。","Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away, leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind."
"驾车驶过美丽的原野是一件舒心的事情。为什么这会给他一种回家的感觉？他曾以为自己永远都不会有这种感受了——感受美丽的天地、远处绽放的紫色花朵还有渐渐温暖的心灵，他越接近那座他的家族住了六百年的古老大宅，这种感觉就越明显。上次他是怎么驾车离开的呢？那时，他一想起那些房门紧闭的房间，想起躺在垂着锦缎的四柱大床上的男孩，他就不寒而栗。他会不会发现那孩子好转一些了，他见到那孩子也不再退缩了呢？那个梦是多么真实啊——那呼唤他的声音是多么美妙清晰，“在花园里——在花园里！”","The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.Why did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel again—that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing, nearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six hundred years?How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed with the brocaded hangings.Was it possible that perhaps he might find him changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his shrinking from him?How real that dream had been—how wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him, “In the garden—In the garden!”"
"“我要试着找找钥匙，”他说，“我要试着把门打开。我一定要做到——虽然我也不清楚为什么。”","“I will try to find the key,” he said.“I will try to open the door.I must—though I don’t know why.”"
"他抵达庄园时，仆人们用惯常的方式来迎接他，他们都发现，他看上去好些了，也没有去他常住的、由皮切尔照看的那个偏远的房间。他去了书房，并派人去请梅德洛克太太。梅德洛克太太来到他跟前时有些激动，有些好奇，也有些惊慌。","When he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the usual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to the remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher.He went into the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock.She came to him somewhat excited and curious and flustered."
"“科林少爷怎么样，梅德洛克？”他问道。“啊，先生，”梅德洛克太太回答，“我跟您这么说吧，他——他变了。”","“How is Master Colin, Medlock?” he inquired.“Well, sir,” Mrs. Medlock answered, “he’s—he’s different, in a manner of speaking.”"
"“恶化了？”他问。","“Worse?” he suggested."
"梅德洛克太太的脸着实变红了。","Mrs. Medlock really was flushed."
"“啊，您看，先生，”她试图解释，“克雷文医生、护士和我都不知道他怎么了。”","“Well, you see, sir,” she tried to explain, “neither Dr. Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.”"
"“到底是怎么回事？”","“Why is that?”"
"“说实话，先生，科林少爷有可能是好转了，也有可能是恶化了。他的胃口，先生，实在是难以理解——他的性子——”","“To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might be changing for the worse.His appetite, sir, is past understanding—and his ways—”"
"“是不是变得越来越古怪了？”主人一边发问一边焦急地皱起了眉。","“Has he become more—more peculiar?” her master, asked, knitting his brows anxiously."
"“正是，先生。他变得非常奇怪——你把他和过去比一比就知道了。以前他什么都不吃，现在却突然食量大增——可是后来又突然不吃了，饭菜还是像以前一样被送回来。你不知道，先生，以前他好像从来不准别人带他出门。以前我们试图让他坐轮椅出门的经历真能让人瑟瑟发抖。他会大发雷霆，克雷文医生说，他可担负不起强迫他的责任。哎，先生，一点征兆都没有——一次他大大地发了一通火之后，突然坚持要玛丽小姐和苏珊•索尔比的儿子迪肯天天带他出门，迪肯可以帮他推轮椅。他很喜欢玛丽小姐和迪肯，迪肯还把他养的动物带过来了，还有，先生，不知道你信不信，他从早到晚都呆在户外。”","“That’s it, sir.He’s growing very peculiar—when you compare him with what he used to be.He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began to eat something enormous—and then he stopped again all at once and the meals were sent back just as they used to be.You never knew, sir, perhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken.The things we’ve gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf.He’d throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said he couldn’t be responsible for forcing him.Well, sir, just without warning—not long after one of his worst tantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby’s boy Dickon that could push his chair.He took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if you’ll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until night.”"
"“他看上去如何？”他又问。","“How does he look?” was the next question."
"“要是他饮食正常，先生，您会觉得他在长肉——但我们担心那时一种浮肿。他和玛丽小姐单独在一起的时候，有时会很奇怪地大笑起来。以前他可从来都不笑。克雷文医生马上就会来见您了，如果您愿意见他的话。他这辈子从来没这么困惑过。”","“If he took his food natural, sir, you’d think he was putting on flesh—but we’re afraid it may be a sort of bloat.He laughs sometimes in a queer way when he’s alone with Miss Mary.He never used to laugh at all.Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you’ll allow him.He never was as puzzled in his life.”"
"“科林少爷现在在哪里？”克雷文先生问。","“Where is Master Colin now?”Mr. Craven asked."
"“在花园里，先生。他总是呆在花园里——不过他怕人看到他，所以任何人都不准靠近。”","“In the garden, sir.He’s always in the garden—though not a human creature is allowed to go near for fear they’ll look at him.”"
"克雷文先生几乎没听到她最后说了些什么。","Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words."
"“在花园里。”他说。让梅德洛克太太离开之后，他站在那里重复了一遍又一遍，“在花园里！”","“In the garden,” he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he stood and repeated it again and again.“In the garden!”"
"他费了不少劲儿才把自己拉回现实中，感觉到自己回归现实之后，他转身离开了房间。他像玛丽那样，穿过了灌木丛中的门，经过了月桂和喷泉花床。喷泉正在喷水，秋天明艳的花朵正围绕着它。他穿过草坪，踏上满是常春藤的墙壁边上的长廊上。他走得不快，而是很缓慢，他的眼睛盯着小径。他觉得自己被拉回到了那个被抛弃了很久的地方，他也不知道为什么。越靠近花园，他的脚步就越慢。虽然有厚厚的常春藤的遮挡，他也知道门在哪里——但他并不知道埋藏钥匙的确切位置。","He had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was standing in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went out of the room.He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.The fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls.He did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path.He felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long forsaken, and he did not know why.As he drew near to it his step became still more slow.He knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over it—but he did not know exactly where it lay—that buried key."
"于是，他停下脚步，站着不动，环顾四周，就在他停下的那一瞬间，他开始聆听——自问是不是正在梦境中穿行。","So he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment after he had paused he started and listened—asking himself if he were walking in a dream."
"厚厚的常春藤遮住了门，钥匙埋在灌木丛下，寂寞的十年间，从没有人穿过那道门——但是，花园里有声音。那声音是奔跑着的杂乱的脚步声，像是在树下一圈一圈地追逐，是奇怪的压低了的声音——是惊叹和捂住嘴的欢乐的呼喊。听起来像是年轻人的笑声，是孩子们抑制不住的笑声，虽然他们努力想不让别人听见，但隔一段时间——兴奋逐渐累积——最后便会爆发。天哪，他到底在做什么梦啊——天哪，他到底听到了什么啊？他是不是失去里理智，觉得自己听到了人类听不到的声音？这就是那遥远清澈的声音所要表达的吗？","The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs, no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years—and yet inside the garden there were sounds.They were the sounds of running scuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they were strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices—exclamations and smothered joyous cries.It seemed actually like the laughter of young things, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so—as their excitement mounted—would burst forth.What in heaven’s name was he dreaming of—what in heaven’s name did he hear?Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?Was it that the far clear voice had meant?"
"接着，那个时刻来临了，在那难以控制的时刻，里面的声音忘了要自我克制。脚步声越来越快——他们离花园门越来越近了——有一阵急促有力的年轻人的喘气声，还有一阵猛然爆发的笑声，听上去是忍不住了才爆发出来的——墙上的门突然打开，一层常春藤向后荡去，一个男孩猛地冲出门来，他没看到门外的人，几乎冲进了他怀里。","And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds forgot to hush themselves.The feet ran faster and faster—they were nearing the garden door—there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained—and the door in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back, and a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his arms."
"克雷文先生及时张开双臂，以防他横冲直撞碰到他身上而摔倒，但是，当克雷文先生把他拉远一些看时，他愣住了，简直透不过气来。","Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a result of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to look at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath."
"那是个高挑俊美的男孩。他身上闪耀着生机，他的脸因为奔跑而荣光焕发。他那头浓密的头发向后梳着，露出了前额，他抬起一双奇特的灰色眼睛——那眼中充满了男孩子气的笑意，眼睛周围是流苏一般的黑色睫毛。正是这双眼睛让克雷文先生透不过气来。“你是谁——什么？谁！”他结结巴巴地说。","He was a tall boy and a handsome one.He was glowing with life and his running had sent splendid color leaping to his face.He threw the thick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes—eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe.It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.“Who—What?Who!” he stammered."
"这可不是科林所预想的——不是他所计划好的。他从没想到过这样一番见面的场景。但是，赢了比赛从门里冲出来，这个方式也许还要好。他尽力站直了身子。玛丽刚才和他一起跑，她也冲出了门。玛丽觉得他把自己弄得比平时都高——高出了好几英寸。","This was not what Colin had expected—this was not what he had planned.He had never thought of such a meeting.And yet to come dashing out—winning a race—perhaps it was even better.He drew himself up to his very tallest.Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed through the door too, believed that he managed to make himself look taller than he had ever looked before—inches taller."
"“爸爸，”他说，“我是科林。你无法相信吧。我自己都不相信。我是科林。”","“Father,” he said, “I’m Colin.You can’t believe it.I scarcely can myself.I’m Colin.”"
"像梅德洛克太太一样，他也不明白他爸爸匆匆念叨的那句话是什么意思。","Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he said hurriedly:"
"“在花园里！在花园里！”","“In the garden! In the garden!”"
"“是啊，”科林赶忙说，“这是花园的功劳——也是玛丽、迪肯和小家伙们的功劳——还有魔法。这事情没人知道。我们一直保守着秘密，等你回来告诉你。我好了，我跑步能赛过玛丽了。我会成为运动员的。”","“Yes,” hurried on Colin.“It was the garden that did it—and Mary and Dickon and the creatures—and the Magic.No one knows.We kept it to tell you when you came.I’m well, I can beat Mary in a race.I’m going to be an athlete.”"
"他说话时完全像个健康的孩子——他脸色红润，由于心情迫切，他讲得有些混乱——克雷文先生的灵魂因为这难以置信的快乐而颤抖起来。","He said it all so like a healthy boy—his face flushed, his words tumbling over each other in his eagerness—that Mr. Craven’s soul shook with unbelieving joy."
"科林伸出手，放在父亲的胳膊上。　　“你不高兴么，爸爸？”最后他说，“你不高兴么？我会活到永远永远永远！”","Colin put out his hand and laid it on his father’s arm.“Aren’t you glad, Father?” he ended.“Aren’t you glad?I’m going to live forever and ever and ever!”"
"克雷文先生把双手搭在男孩的肩头，一动不动。他知道有一阵子他都不敢讲话。　　“孩子，领我进花园吧，”他终于说，“把一切都告诉我吧。”","Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy’s shoulders and held him still.He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.“Take me into the garden, my boy,” he said at last.“And tell me all about it.”"
"他们把他领了进去。","And so they led him in."
"花园里一派秋景，金色、紫色、蓝紫色和火红色交织，每一侧都有一丛丛晚百合一起站立着——那百合是白色的，或是白色和深红色相间的。他清楚地记得第一丛百合是什么时候种下的，在一年中的这个时节，百合正应该绽放着自己的光彩。晚玫瑰爬上来，又垂下去，聚成一丛一丛，阳光为正在变黄的树叶染上了更深的颜色，让人感觉自己正站在一个树木环绕的金色庙堂之中。新来的人默默地站着，就像孩子们刚进来看到满目的灰色时一样。他向周围看了又看。","The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standing together—lilies which were white or white and ruby.He remembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at this season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.Late roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an embowered temple of gold.The newcomer stood silent just as the children had done when they came into its grayness.He looked round and round."
"“我本以为这个花园已经死了。”他说。","“I thought it would be dead,” he said."
"“起初玛丽也是这么想的，”科林说，“但它活过来了。”","“Mary thought so at first,” said Colin.“But it came alive.”"
"然后，一群人在他们的树下坐了下来——科林除外，讲故事的时候他想站着。","Then they sat down under their tree—all but Colin, who wanted to stand while he told the story."
"阿奇博尔德•克雷文觉得，这是他这辈子听到过的最奇特的事情了，而且是被一个男孩滔滔不绝、一股脑儿地倾吐出来。秘密、魔法、野生动物还有那奇怪的午夜相遇——春天的到来——还有自尊心受挫激得年轻的王爷自己站起来以当面反击本•韦瑟斯塔夫的故事。奇特的伙伴、他们演的戏还有那个被小心保守着的天大秘密。克雷文先生笑得流出了眼泪，有时，他没在笑，但眼泪也会涌出来。那个运动员、演说家、科学发现者是一个有趣的、可爱的、健康的年轻人。　　“现在，”故事的最后，他说道，“不必再保守秘密了。我敢说，他们看到我几乎会被吓昏——但我以后再也不坐轮椅了。我和你一起走回去，爸爸——回到房子里。”","It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought, as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.Mystery and Magic and wild creatures, the weird midnight meeting—the coming of the spring—the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah to his feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face.The odd companionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept.The listener laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears came into his eyes when he was not laughing.The Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.“Now,” he said at the end of the story, “it need not be a secret any more.I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see me—but I am never going to get into the chair again.I shall walk back with you, Father—to the house.”"
"本•韦瑟斯塔夫很尽职，他很少离开花园，但这一次，他借口送蔬菜到厨房，离开了花园，梅德洛克太太请他到仆人大厅喝一杯啤酒，所以，当米瑟斯韦特庄园这一代人的最戏剧性的事情发生时，他也在场——这也正好如他所愿。从对着院子的一扇窗子里可以看到草地。梅德洛克太太知道本刚从花园里过来，便希望他看到过主人，甚至碰巧看到主人和科林少爷相逢的场面。","Ben Weatherstaff’s duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on this occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the servants’ hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of beer he was on the spot—as he had hoped to be—when the most dramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present generation actually took place.One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped that he might have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin."
"“你看到他们中的任何一个了么，韦瑟斯塔夫？”她问。","“Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?” she asked."
"本把酒杯从嘴边拿开，用手背抹了抹嘴。","Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back of his hand."
"“啊，我看到了，”他狡黠而意味深长地回答。","“Aye, that I did,” he answered with a shrewdly significant air."
"“两个都见到了？”梅德洛克太太问。　　“两个都见到了，”本•韦瑟斯塔夫回答道，“谢谢你，夫人，我还能再喝一杯。”","“Both of them?” suggested Mrs. Medlock.“Both of ‘em,” returned Ben Weatherstaff.“Thank ye kindly, ma’am, I could sup up another mug of it.”"
"“两人一起？”梅德洛克太太大为兴奋，她一边急匆匆地为他倒酒一边问。","“Together?” said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her excitement."
"“两人一起，夫人。”酒刚满上，本又一口气灌下半杯。","“Together, ma’am,” and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp."
"“科林少爷在哪里？他看上去怎么样？他们互相之间都说了些什么？”","“Where was Master Colin?How did he look?What did they say to each other?”"
"“这我就没听到了，”本说，“再说我只是站在梯子上从墙头看到的。","“I didna’ hear that,” said Ben, “along o’ only bein’ on th’ stepladder lookin, over th’ wall."
"不过我可以告诉你，你们这些呆在屋子里的人可不知道外头发生了什么。你们很快就会知道的，很快。”","But I'll tell thee this. There’s been things goin’ on outside as you house people knows nowt about.An’ what tha’ll find out tha’ll find out soon.”"
"不到两分钟，他就喝光了最后一点啤酒，向着窗子郑重地挥了挥酒杯，透过窗子可以看到灌木丛中露出的一片草地。","And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and waved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the shrubbery a piece of the lawn."
"“如果你觉得好奇，”他说，“就向那儿看。看看草地那一头谁走过来了。”","“Look there,” he said, “if tha’s curious.Look what’s comin’ across th’ grass.”"
"梅德洛克太太看了一眼，便高高举起双手，发出一声尖叫，所有听到叫声的男仆女仆们都穿过大厅来到窗前向外看，他们的眼珠都快要掉出来了。","When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the servants’ hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes almost starting out of their heads."
"穿过草地走来的是米瑟斯韦特庄园的主人，他的样子是许多人从未见过的。在他旁边，高昂着头，眼中充满笑意，而且步伐像约克郡所有的男孩一样稳健的，正是——科林少爷。","Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many of them had never seen him.And by his side with his head up in the air and his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy in Yorkshire—Master Colin."
