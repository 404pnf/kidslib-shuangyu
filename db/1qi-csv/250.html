		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然已经72岁，但在暗淡的光线下，波林·阿滕伯勒有时仍会被误认为是30岁。　她真的是一位保养得极好的妇人，非常时髦。当然，拥有一副恰到好处的身材也帮了很大的忙。若是死去，她应该会留下一副精美的骨架，她的头骨也会是一副精致的头骨，就像一些伊特鲁里亚妇女的头骨一样，在骨骼的交错和漂亮纯真的牙齿中，仍然散发着女性的魅力。</td>
		<td class="en">At seventy-two, Pauline Attenborough could still sometimes be mistaken, in the half-light, for thirty.She really was a wonderfully-preserved woman, of perfect chic.Of course it helps a great deal to have the right frame.She would be an exquisite skeleton, and her skull would be an exquisite skull, like that of some Etruscan woman with feminine charm still in the swerve of the bone and the pretty, naive teeth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿滕伯勒夫人有一张完美的鹅蛋脸，脸蛋稍稍有些扁平，看起来恰到好处。脸上没有一丝松弛的赘肉。她的鼻子沿着漂亮连贯的弧线安详地突伸出来。只有她脸上那双灰色的大眼睛有点太显眼，最能暴露出她的年龄。略显蓝色的眼皮看起来有些沉重，似乎是为了努力保持下面眼睛的明亮狡黠，有时会疼痛；眼角处散落着一些细小皱纹，松弛时会显出她的疲惫，然后向上拉紧时，则又是一副明亮欢快的表情，就像达·芬奇（列奥纳多·达·芬奇）画中一个真能纵情欢笑的女人。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Attenborough’s face was of the perfect oval and slightly flat type that wears best.There is no flesh to sag.Her nose rode serenely, in its finely-bridged curve.Only the big grey eyes were a tiny bit prominent, on the surface of her face, and they gave her away most.The bluish lids were heavy, as if they ached sometimes with the strain of keeping the eyes beneath them arch and bright; and at the corners of the eyes were fine little wrinkles which would slacken into haggardness, then be pulled up tense again to that bright, gay look like a Leonardo woman who really could laugh outright.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的侄女塞西莉亚也许是这世界上唯一一个发现了那条看不见的细线的人，这条细线连接着波林的眼角纹和她的意志力。只有塞西莉亚曾有意识地注视过她的眼睛，看着它们变得憔悴、苍老和疲惫，而且长达几个小时都是如此，直到罗伯特回家。然后，砰！——波林的意志力和脸之间的那条神秘细线立刻拉紧，那双疲惫、憔悴、突出的眼睛突然开始闪烁，眼皮弯成了弧形，眉毛也呈脆弱的弧形浮在前额上，奇怪地弯曲着，开始表露出一丝嘲笑的意味，然后你就会见到这位真正的美妇人，周身都发散着魅力。</td>
		<td class="en">Her niece Cecilia was perhaps the only person in the world who was aware of the invisible little wire which connected Pauline’s eye-wrinkles with Pauline’s willpower.Only Cecilia consciously watched the eyes go haggard and old and tired, and remain so, for hours; until Robert came home.Then ping!—the mysterious little wire that worked between Pauline’s will and her face went taut, the weary, haggard, prominent eyes suddenly began to gleam, the eyelids arched, the queer, curved eyebrows which floated in such frail arches on Pauline’s forehead began to gather a mocking significance, and you had the real lovely lady, in all her charm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她确实知道永葆青春的秘诀；也就是说，她可以重披青春的外衣，就像一只鹰一样。但她却谨慎地使用着这个秘诀。她很聪明，明白不应在过多的人面前显得年轻。晚上在家的儿子罗伯特，有时过来喝下午茶的威尔弗里德·奈普爵士，以及星期天罗伯特在家时偶尔来访的客人——对于这些人来说，她是那个可爱的、从未改变过的自己，岁月不曾使她枯萎，习惯也未曾使她变得乏味；她总是那么明快、友好却又隐约带着一丝嘲讽，就像对所有事情都略知一二的蒙娜丽莎一样。但波林知道得更多，因此她完全不需要自鸣得意。她可以像狂饮作乐的女人那样，发出可爱却带有一丝嘲讽的笑声，这笑声从不含一点恶意，总是和蔼地容忍着所有的美德和邪恶——当然，前者需要更多的宽容。她调皮地如此暗示着。</td>
		<td class="en">She really had the secret of everlasting youth; that is to say, she could don her youth again like an eagle.But she was sparing of it.She was wise enough not to try being young for too many people.Her son Robert, in the evenings, and Sir Wilfrid Knipe sometimes in the afternoon to tea; then occasional visitors on Sunday, when Robert was home—for these she was her lovely and changeless self, that age could not wither, nor custom stale; so bright and kindly and yet subtly mocking, like Mona Lisa, who knew a thing or two.But Pauline knew more, so she needn’t be smug at all.She could laugh that lovely, mocking Bacchante laugh of hers, which was at the same time never malicious, always good-naturedly tolerant, both of virtues and vices—the former, of course, taking much more tolerating.So she suggested, roguishly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >只有与她的侄女塞西莉亚在一起时，她才不会费心去维持这种魅力。不管怎样，西丝并不是非常善于观察；不仅如此，她还长得很平庸；而且，她正恋着罗伯特；最重要的是，她已经30岁了，却还得依靠她的婶婶波林生活。哦，塞西莉亚——为什么要为她费神呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Only with her niece Cecilia she did not trouble to keep up the glamour.Ciss was not very observant, anyhow; and, more than that, she was plain; more still, she was in love with Robert; and most of all, she was thirty, and dependent on her aunt Pauline.Oh, Cecilia—why make music for her?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >塞西莉亚是一位高大的姑娘，有着深色皮肤和一张哈巴狗似的脸，她婶婶和堂兄罗伯特都只叫她西丝，就像小猫发出的呼噜呼噜的叫声。她几乎不怎么说话，即使说话，也总是磕磕巴巴的。她的父亲是一位贫穷的公理会牧师，在世时，是波林婶婶的丈夫罗纳德的兄弟。罗纳德和这位议会牧师都已过世，于是婶婶波林就负责照顾西丝，这样已经有五年了。</td>
		<td class="en">Cecilia, called by her aunt and by her cousin Robert just Ciss, like a cat spitting, was a big, dark-complexioned, pug-faced young woman who very rarely spoke, and when she did couldn’t get it out.She was the daughter of a poor Congregational clergyman who had been, while he lived, brother to Ronald, Aunt Pauline’s husband.Ronald and the Congregational minister were both well dead, and Aunt Pauline had had charge of Ciss for the last five years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们一起住在安妮女王时代的房子里，房子虽不大，但很精致，在城外25公里处，隐匿在一个小山谷中，房子四周环绕着面积不大却古雅舒适的庭园。对于72岁的波林婶婶来说，这里是一处理想的住所，在这里过的也是一种理想的生活。当翠鸟在她花园里的小溪上掠过，向桤木下飞去时，她的心里似乎也有些东西闪过。她就是那种女人。</td>
		<td class="en">They lived all together in a quite exquisite though rather small Queen Anne house some twenty-five miles out of town, secluded in a little dale, and surrounded by small but very quaint and pleasant grounds.It was an ideal place and an ideal life for Aunt Pauline, at the age of seventy-two.When the kingfishers flashed up the little stream in her garden, going under the alders, something still flashed in her heart.She was that kind of woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比西丝年长两岁的罗伯特，每天都会进城去律师事务所工作，他的事务所在一个律师学院里。他虽是一名律师，但一年的收入却只有大约一百英镑，这没人知道，但他却深感羞耻。他就是无法赚得再多一些，而要低于这个数目却很容易。当然，这并不重要。波林有钱。但是，波林的钱始终是波林的，尽管她给钱的时候很大方，但一个人接受了令人愉快却并不应得的礼物，总是会觉得不舒服的。而波林婶婶会说，越是不应得的礼物，越是令人愉快。</td>
		<td class="en">Robert, who was two years older than Ciss, went every day to town, to his chambers in one of the Inns.He was a barrister, and, to his secret but very deep mortification, he earned about a hundred pounds a year.He simply couldn’t get above that figure, though it was rather easy to get below it.Of course, it didn’t matter.Pauline had money.But then, what was Pauline’s was Pauline’s, and though she could give almost lavishly, still, one was always aware of having a lovely and undeserved present made to one.Presents are so much nicer when they’re undeserved, Aunt Pauline would say.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >和西丝一样，罗伯特也是相貌普通，而且几乎不怎么说话。他中等身材，肩膀宽阔，长得非常结实，却并不胖。只有他那张光滑细腻、刮得很干净的脸显得比较胖，在安静神秘的神情下，他有时让人联想起意大利的神父。但他有着一双和他母亲一样的灰色眼睛，却显得非常羞怯和不安，并不像波林的那么大胆。他极度羞怯不安，习惯性地觉得自己呆在了不该呆的地方，几乎就像一个灵魂进入了错误的躯体。或许西丝是唯一看穿这些的人。但罗伯特从未采取过任何措施。他依旧每天去律师事务所，并研读法律。而所有那些古老奇怪的诉讼程序总能引起他的兴趣。除了他母亲没人知道，他拥有一套非常特别的古墨西哥法律文件——多是关于诉讼程序以及审判、辩护、指控的报告，这些文件是17世纪墨西哥教会法律和普通法律的一种奇怪而可怕的混合。他无意中读到了一篇关于1620年墨西哥以谋杀罪审判两名英国海员的报告，于是开始了这个方向的研究；他继续研究了下去，看到的下一篇文件说的是1680年对唐米格尔·埃斯特拉达的指控，指控他诱奸瓦哈卡圣心女修道院的一名修女。</td>
		<td class="en">Robert, too, was plain, and almost speechless.He was medium sized, rather broad and stout, though not fat.Only his creamy, clean-shaven face was rather fat, and sometimes suggestive of an Italian priest, in its silence and its secrecy.But he had grey eyes like his mother, but very shy and uneasy, not bold like hers.Perhaps Ciss was the only person who fathomed his awful shyness and malaise, his habitual feeling that he was in the wrong place: almost like a soul that has got into a wrong body.But he never did anything about it.He went up to Chambers, and read law.It was, however, all the weird old processes that interested him.He had, unknown to everybody but his mother, a quite extraordinary collection of old Mexican legal documents—reports of processes and trials, pleas, accusations: the weird and awful mixture of ecclesiastical law and common law in seventeenth-century Mexico.He had started a study in this direction through coming across the report of a trial of two English sailors, for murder, in Mexico, in 1620, and he had gone on, when the next document was an accusation against a Don Miguel Estrada for seducing one of the nuns of the Sacred Heart Convent in Oaxaca in 1680.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波林和她的儿子罗伯特通过阅读这些旧文件，度过了很多美好的夜晚。这位美妇人懂一点西班牙语。她自己看起来甚至有些像西班牙人，头上高高地别着一把梳子，身上披着一块极好看的深棕色披肩，上面有粗粗的银色丝线绣成的图案。她会坐在那漂亮的古桌前，深褐色的桌面有如天鹅绒般柔软。她发间高高地别着一把梳子，耳朵上戴着带有垂饰的耳环，赤裸着的手臂依旧美丽，颈上环着几串珍珠，身着一件紫褐色天鹅绒裙子，披着这块或其他漂亮的披肩，在烛光下，她俨然就是一位三十二三岁、拥有高贵血统的西班牙美人。她摆好蜡烛，使脸上的明暗对比恰到好处，她知道这样很适合她；她背后高高的椅背由古老的绿色锦缎包裹着，在锦缎的映衬下，她的脸就像圣诞节的玫瑰一样鲜明。</td>
		<td class="en">Pauline and her son Robert had wonderful evenings with these old papers.The lovely lady knew a little Spanish.She even looked a trifle Spanish herself, with a high comb and a marvellous dark-brown shawl embroidered in thick silvery silk embroidery.So she would sit at the perfect old table, soft as velvet in its deep brown surface, a high comb in her hair, ear-rings with dropping pendants in her ears, her arms bare and still beautiful, a few strings of pearls round her throat, a puce velvet dress on and this or another beautiful shawl, and by candlelight she looked, yes, a Spanish high-bred beauty of thirty-two or three.She set the candles to give her face just the chiaroscuro she knew suited her; her high chair that rose behind her face was done in old green brocade, against which her face emerged like a Christmas rose.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们三人总是一起吃饭，每次都要喝一瓶香槟：波林两杯，西丝两杯，剩下的就留给罗伯特。这位美妇人容光焕发，光彩照人。西丝黑色的头发剪短了，宽阔的肩膀包裹在波林婶婶帮她做的一件好看合体的裙子里。她用相当困惑却又静默的淡褐色眼睛凝视着她的婶婶，然后转向她的堂兄，之后再看回来，扮演着一个被适度打动的观众的角色。一直以来，她都会在某些地方被打动。即使已经过去了五年，她还是会被波林的光彩震撼得说不出话来。但是在她意识深处，却藏着一份资料，这资料和罗伯特曾研究的文件一样怪异，那就是她所知道的关于她婶婶和堂兄的所有事情。</td>
		<td class="en">They were always three at table, and they always drank a bottle of champagne: Pauline two glasses, Ciss two glasses, Robert the rest.The lovely lady sparkled and was radiant.Ciss, her black hair bobbed, her broad shoulders in a very nice and becoming dress that Aunt Pauline had helped her to make, stared from her aunt to her cousin and back again, with rather confused, mute hazel eyes, and played the part of an audience suitably impressed.She was impressed, somewhere, all the time.And even rendered speechless by Pauline’s brilliancy, even after five years.But at the bottom of her consciousness was the data of as weird a document as Robert ever studied: all the things she knew about her aunt and her cousin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗伯特一直以来都是位绅士，他的举止里有一种老式的、谨慎的礼貌，这礼貌完全掩盖了他的羞怯。西丝知道，与羞怯比起来，他其实更加困惑。他的情况比她还要严重。塞西莉亚自己只是在五年前才开始感到困惑。罗伯特的困惑恐怕在出生之前就已经开始了。在这位美妇人的子宫内，他肯定就已经感觉到非常困惑。</td>
		<td class="en">Robert was always a gentleman, with an old-fashioned, punctilious courtesy that covered his shyness quite completely.He was, and Ciss knew it, more confused than shy.He was worse than she was.Cecilia’s own confusion dated from only five years back.Robert’s must have started before he was born.In the lovely lady’s womb he must have felt very confused.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他将自己所有的注意力都集中到了他母亲的身上，就像一朵卑微的小花被太阳吸引了一样。然而，就像一个神父，通过自己意识的末梢，他一直以来都知道西丝就在那里，知道她有一点被隔绝在外，知道似乎有些事情不大对劲。他察觉到了这个屋子里第三个意识的存在。而对波林来说，她的侄女塞西莉亚只是她环境中恰当的一部分，而非一个独立的意识。</td>
		<td class="en">He paid all his attention to his mother, drawn to her as a humble flower to the sun.And yet, priest-like, he was all the time aware, with the tail of his consciousness, that Ciss was there, and that she was a bit shut out of it, and that something wasn’t right.He was aware of the third consciousness in the room.Whereas to Pauline, her niece Cecilia was an appropriate part of her own setting, rather than a distinct consciousness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗伯特与母亲以及西丝在温暖的客厅里喝着咖啡。客厅里，所有的家具都很精致，全部都值得收藏——阿滕伯勒夫人曾倒卖油画、家具以及一些半开化国家的珍稀物品，赚了些钱。这三个人随意地闲聊，一直聊到八点或八点半。这客厅真的非常舒适、非常温暖，甚至非常像一个家；波林用这么些高雅的物品打造了一种真实如家的温暖。谈话都很简单，而且几乎总是很欢快。波林就是她那个真实的自己，不时表现出一种友好的嘲弄以及一种奇怪的、带着讽刺的快乐，直到谈话出现了短暂的停顿。</td>
		<td class="en">Robert took coffee with his mother and Ciss in the warm drawing-room, where all the furniture was so lovely, all collectors’ pieces—Mrs. Attenborough had made her own money, dealing privately in pictures and furniture and rare things from barbaric countries—and the three talked desultorily till about eight or half-past.It was very pleasant, very cosy, very homely even; Pauline made a real home cosiness out of so much elegant material.The chat was simple, and nearly always bright.Pauline was her real self, emanating a friendly mockery and an odd, ironic gaiety—till there came a little pause.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，西丝总是会站起来道晚安，然后带走咖啡托盘，以防伯内特再进来打扰。</td>
		<td class="en">At which Ciss always rose and said good-night, and carried out the coffee-tray, to prevent Burnett from intruding any more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后！啊，然后，晚间那令人愉快、热情洋溢的亲密气氛出现在母亲和儿子间，当他们一起解读手稿，讨论观点时，波林会带着小女生一般的渴望，在这一点上她是出了名的。而这种渴望确实是发自内心的。在与男人接触的时候，她总以某种神秘的方式聚积着自己的能量，以变得兴奋。罗伯特稳重、安静而温和，看起来倒像两人当中较年长的那个——几乎就像一个牧师带着一个年轻女学生。而那恰恰也是他的感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">And then!Ah, then, the lovely, glowing intimacy of the evening, between mother and son, when they deciphered manuscripts and discussed points, Pauline with that eagerness of a girl for which she was famous.And it was quite genuine.In some mysterious way she had saved up her power for being thrilled, in connection with a man.Robert, solid, rather quiet and subdued, seemed like the elder of the two—almost like a priest with a young girl pupil.And that was rather how he felt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >西丝自己住在庭园那边的一套房间里，就在老的马车房和马厩上面。马厩里没有马。罗伯特把车停在马车房中。西丝在那上面有三间非常不错的房间，一间挨着一间，连成一排，而她已经习惯了马厩中钟表的滴答声。</td>
		<td class="en">Ciss had a flat for herself just across the courtyard, over the old coach-house and stables.There were no horses.Robert kept his car in the coach-house.Ciss had three very nice rooms up there, stretching along in a row one after the other, and she had got used to the ticking of the stable clock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但有时她并不是出了客厅就直接回她的房间。夏天，她会坐在草坪上，透过楼上客厅开着的窗户，她能听到波林美妙、内省的笑声。冬天，这个年轻女子会穿上一件厚外套，缓缓走上小溪上那座带有栏杆的小桥，然后回过头向客厅那三扇亮着灯的窗户望去，那里，母亲和儿子正快乐地坐在一起。</td>
		<td class="en">But sometimes she did not go to her rooms.In the summer she would sit on the lawn, and from the open window of the drawing-room upstairs she would hear Pauline’s wonderful, heart-searching laugh.And in winter the young woman would put on a thick coat and walk slowly to the little balustraded bridge over the stream, and then look back at the three lighted windows of that drawing-room where mother and son were so happy together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >西丝爱罗伯特，而且她相信波林有意让他们两个人结婚——但要在波林死后。但可怜的罗伯特，无论是与男人还是女人在一起，他都已经羞怯得不知所措了。当他母亲死时他又会变成什么样子？——再过个十几年。他可能会仅剩一个壳，一个从未生活过的男人的壳。</td>
		<td class="en">Ciss loved Robert, and she believed that Pauline intended the two of them to marry—when she was dead.But poor Robert, he was so convulsed with shyness already, with man or woman.What would he be when his mother was dead?—in a dozen more years.He would be just a shell, the shell of a man who had never lived.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他们被笼罩在那个老人的阴影下时，两个年轻人便相互同情起来，这种奇怪又无法言喻的同情就成为罗伯特和西丝之间的一条纽带。但另一条纽带，西丝却不知道该如何拉紧，那就是他们之间激情的纽带。可怜的罗伯特天生就是一个充满激情的人。他的沉默，他那隐藏起来却又令他痛苦不堪的羞怯，都是肉体上秘密的激情在作祟。　波林利用的不就是这一点吗！唉，西丝并不是看不见他那双注视着他母亲的眼睛——一双迷醉却又受辱的眼睛，充满了羞愧。他为自己不像一个真正的男人而感到羞愧。然而他并非爱上了自己的母亲。他只是为她着迷。完全被迷住啦。至于其他，那便是被一生的困惑所麻痹。</td>
		<td class="en">The strange, unspoken sympathy of the young with one another, when they are overshadowed by the old, was one of the bonds between Robert and Ciss.But another bond, which Ciss did not know how to draw tight, was the bond of passion.Poor Robert was by nature a passionate man.His silence and his agonised, though hidden, shyness were both the result of a secret physical passionateness.And how Pauline could play on this!Ah, Ciss was not blind to the eyes which he fixed on his mother—eyes fascinated yet humiliated, full of shame.He was ashamed that he was not a man.And he did not love his mother.He was fascinated by her.Completely fascinated.And for the rest, paralysed in a life-long confusion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >西丝会在花园中一直呆到波林卧室的灯亮起为止——一般在十点左右。这位美妇人回去就寝。罗伯特会一个人再呆一个小时左右。然后他也会去就寝。西丝站在外面的黑暗中，有时希望自己能悄悄地靠近他，并对他说：“哦，罗伯特！这是不对的！”但是波林婶婶会听到的。而且不管怎样，西丝都做不到这一点。她动身回自己的房间，一次，又一次，永远都是这样。</td>
		<td class="en">Ciss stayed in the garden till the lights leapt up in Pauline’s bedroom—about ten o’clock.The lovely lady had retired.Robert would now stay another hour or so, alone.Then he, too, would retire.Ciss, in the dark outside, sometimes wished she could creep up to him and say: “Oh, Robert!It’s all wrong!”But Aunt Pauline would hear.And, anyhow, Ciss couldn’t do it.She went off to her own rooms, once more, once more, and so for ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >早晨，咖啡被放在托盘上分别送至这三个亲属的房间里。西丝九点时要去威尔弗里德·奈普爵士家，给他的小孙女上两个小时的课。除了因为热爱而弹钢琴外，这是她唯一的一份正经差事。罗伯特大概九点钟动身进城。一般说来，波林婶婶会在午饭时出现，尽管有时直到下午茶时她才会现身。当她出现时，她总是看起来既精神又年轻。但白天，她很快就会显出老态，就像没有浇水的花一样。蜡烛燃起时才是属于她的时光。</td>
		<td class="en">In the morning coffee was brought up on a tray to each of the rooms of the three relatives.Ciss had to be at Sir Wilfrid Knipe’s at nine o’clock, to give two hours’ lessons to his little grand-daughter.It was her sole serious occupation, except that she played the piano for the love of it.Robert set off to town about nine.And as a rule, Aunt Pauline appeared to lunch, though sometimes not till tea-time.When she appeared, she looked fresh and young.But she was inclined to fade rather rapidly, like a flower without water, in the daytime.Her hour was the candle hour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此她总是在下午休息。当太阳照耀时，如果可能的话，她会享受一回日光浴。这是她的秘诀之一。她的午餐非常清淡；她的“日光和空气浴”会在午前或午后进行，随她高兴。但通常是在下午，那时，暖洋洋的太阳照进马厩后面一个奇怪的、紫杉围绕的小广场中。在这儿，西丝会摊开躺椅，铺上毯子，并把轻巧的阳伞放在一小块安静的围场中，这样拿起来方便。围场是用紫杉树篱围成的，在废马厩的老红墙外面。而后，美妇人就会拿着书走过来。然后西丝就得回她自己的房间里警惕地守着，以防她耳尖的婶婶听到什么脚步声。</td>
		<td class="en">So she always rested in the afternoon.When the sun shone, if possible she took a sun-bath.This was one of her secrets.Her lunch was very light; she could take her sun-and-air-bath before noon or after, as it pleased her.Often it was in the afternoon, when the sun shone very warmly into a queer little yew-walled square just behind the stables.Here Ciss stretched out the lying-chair and rugs, and put the light parasol handy in the silent little enclosure of thick dark yew-hedges beyond the old red walls of the unused stables.And hither came the lovely lady with her book.Ciss then had to be on guard in one of her own rooms, should her aunt, who was very keen-eared, hear a footstep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天下午，塞西莉亚突然想到，她自己也可以晒个日光浴来消磨这相当漫长的午后。她变得焦躁不安起来。塞西莉亚想到，她可以顺着房子尽头的那间阁楼，爬到马厩的屋顶平台上，这个想法让她开始了新的冒险。她经常到屋顶上去，因为她要为马厩的钟表上发条，所以必须上去，这是她自己揽下来的活。现在她取出一块毯子，爬出来站在天空下，看着蓝天和巨大的榆树顶，再看看太阳，然后脱下身上的东西，坦然无惧地在屋顶角落的挡墙下躺了下来，全身沐浴着阳光。</td>
		<td class="en">One afternoon it occurred to Cecilia that she herself might while away this rather long afternoon hour by taking a sun-bath.She was growing restive.The thought of the flat roof of the stable buildings, to which she could climb from a loft at the end, started her on a new adventure.She often went on to the roof; she had to, to wind up the stable clock, which was a job she had assumed to herself.Now she took a rug, climbed out under the heavens, looked at the sky and the great elm-tops, looked at the sun, then took off her things and lay down perfectly securely, in a corner of the roof under the parapet, full in the sun.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >像这样在暖洋洋的阳光和空气中晒着全身，真是令人愉快。是的，这真是太完美啦！这甚至好像融化了她心中的一些坚硬的苦涩，融化了那些从未消散过的无法言喻的怨恨纠结。她舒舒服服地伸展着自己，这样太阳就能完全触到她的四肢，完全地。若她没有其他爱人的话，她一定会爱上太阳。她放纵地翻滚着。</td>
		<td class="en">It was rather lovely, to bask all one’s length like this in warm sun and air.Yes, it was very lovely!It even seemed to melt some of the hard bitterness of her heart, some of that core of unspoken resentment which never dissolved.Luxuriously, she spread herself, so that the sun should touch her limbs fully, fully.If she had no other lover, she should have the sun!She rolled over voluptuously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然她的心脏停止了跳动，耳边传来一个轻柔的、若有所思的声音，让她感到毛骨悚然。</td>
		<td class="en">And suddenly her heart stood still in her body, and her hair almost rose on end as a voice said very softly, musingly, in her ear:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是的，亲爱的亨利！你去世了而没能跟那个克劳迪娅结婚，这并不是我的错。不是我的错，亲爱的。我非常、非常愿意让你娶她，尽管她一点也配不上你。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, Henry dear!It was not my fault you died instead of marrying that Claudia.No, darling.I was quite, quite willing for you to marry her, unsuitable though she was.”</td></tr>
