"幸福","Bliss"
"作者：曼斯菲尔德","By Katherine Mansfield          "
"尽管伯莎·扬已经三十岁了，她还是有这样的时候：想以奔跑代替走路，踩着舞步在人行道上跳上跳下，滚个铁环，往空中抛起个东西再接住，或者一动不动地站着笑起来——可是，根本没有什么可笑的事情。","ALTHOUGH Bertha Young was thirty she still had moments like this when she wanted to run instead of walk, to take dancing steps on and off the pavement, to bowl a hoop, to throw something up in the air and catch it again, or to stand still and laugh at—nothing—at nothing, simply."
"如果你也三十岁了，转过你住的那条街的拐角处时，突然感到欣喜若狂——无与伦比的幸福！——仿佛突然间吞下那天下午一片灿烂的阳光，那光在你的胸中燃烧，向你的每个细胞、每根手指和脚趾都散发出一阵火花，你能怎么样呢？……","What can you do if you are thirty and, turning the corner of your own street, you are overcome, suddenly by a feeling of bliss—absolute bliss!—as though you’d suddenly swallowed a bright piece of that late afternoon sun and it burned in your bosom, sending out a little shower of sparks into every particle, into every finger and toe?..."
"噢，除了“陶醉和混乱”，难道你就没有其他方式可以表达这种感受吗？文明社会真是愚蠢啊！如果你必须把这种感受像一把极其极其稀有的提琴一样珍藏在琴盒里，为什么还给你一个身体？","Oh, is there no way you can express it without being “drunk and disorderly”?How idiotic civilisation is!Why be given a body if you have to keep it shut up in a case like a rare, rare fiddle?"
"“不，那个提琴的比喻还不能确切地表达我的意思。”她想着，跑上台阶，在包里摸钥匙——她忘了带了，就像往常一样——于是咔哒咔哒碰响信箱叫开门。“我并不想这样，因为——谢谢你，玛丽”——她走进门厅。“保姆回来了吗？”","“No, that about the fiddle is not quite what I mean,” she thought, running up the steps and feeling in her bag for the key—she’d forgotten it, as usual—and rattling the letter-box.“It’s not what I mean, because—Thank you, Mary”—she went into the hall.“Is nurse back?”"
"“是的，太太。”","“Yes, M’m.”"
"“水果也送来啦？”","“And has the fruit come?”"
"“送来啦，太太。每件东西都送到了。”","“Yes, M’m.Everything’s come.”"
"“把水果都放到饭厅去，好吗？我上楼之前会把水果摆好的。”","“Bring the fruit up to the dining-room, will you?I’ll arrange it before I go upstairs.”"
"饭厅里昏暗且特别寒冷。尽管如此，伯莎还是脱下大衣；那件大衣把身体裹得太紧，她再也受不了了，不想再多穿一会儿；可脱了大衣，她的胳膊顿时感到一阵寒气。","It was dusky in the dining-room and quite chilly.But all the same Bertha threw off her coat; she could not bear the tight clasp of it another moment, and the cold air fell on her arms."
"然而她胸中依然有个地方明亮灼热——那阵小火花就从那儿迸发出来。这简直让人难以忍受。她几乎不敢呼吸了，害怕那样会把火扇得更旺，不过还是深深地、深深地吸着气。她几乎不敢照那面冰冷的镜子——但还是照了，镜子里映照出一个容光焕发的女人，微笑着，嘴唇颤动，眼睛又大又黑，那神情似在倾听，等待着什么……神圣的事情发生……她知道那一定会发生的……绝对没错。","But in her bosom there was still that bright glowing place—that shower of little sparks coming from it.It was almost unbearable.She hardly dared to breathe for fear of fanning it higher, and yet she breathed deeply, deeply.She hardly dared to look into the cold mirror—but she did look, and it gave her back a woman, radiant, with smiling, trembling lips, with big, dark eyes and an air of listening, waiting for something... divine to happen... that she knew must happen... infallibly."
"玛丽用托盘把水果送过来，还拿来一个玻璃碗，一个非常可爱的蓝色盘子，呈现出一种奇妙的光辉，好像那盘子在牛奶里浸泡过一样。","Mary brought in the fruit on a tray and with it a glass bowl, and a blue dish, very lovely, with a strange sheen on it as though it had been dipped in milk."
"“我打开灯好吗，太太？”","“Shall I turn on the light, M’m?”"
"“不用，谢谢你。我能看清。”","“No, thank you.I can see quite well.”"
"摆放的水果有橘子，带草莓粉色的苹果，几个黄色的梨，光滑如丝，还有一些覆着一层银白果霜的白葡萄和一大串紫葡萄。这些紫葡萄是她为了与饭厅的新地毯颜色协调才刚刚买的。没错，这听起来有点牵强荒谬，但她确实是因为这个才买的。她在商店时想：“我必须买点紫色的东西，使地毯的颜色与桌上的颜色相配。”而且当时似乎觉得很有道理。","There were tangerines and apples stained with strawberry pink. Some yellow pears, smooth as silk, some white grapes covered with a silver bloom and a big cluster of purple ones.These last she had bought to tone in with the new dining-room carpet.Yes, that did sound rather far-fetched and absurd, but it was really why she had bought them.She had thought in the shop: “I must have some purple ones to bring the carpet up to the table.”And it had seemed quite sense at the time."
"她把这些颜色鲜亮、形状圆润的水果摆成两个圆锥形，摆放完毕，站在离桌子远些的地方，看看效果——真是精致极了。因为深色的桌子似乎融进了暗淡的光线里，玻璃盘子和蓝色的碗仿佛浮在空中。这些，当然，以她眼下的心情看，真是美得令人难以置信……她开始笑起来。","When she had finished with them and had made two pyramids of these bright round shapes, she stood away from the table to get the effect—and it really was most curious.For the dark table seemed to melt into the dusky light and the glass dish and the blue bowl to float in the air.This, of course, in her present mood, was so incredibly beautiful....She began to laugh."
"“不，不行。我太兴奋了。”她抓起包和大衣，跑到楼上的婴儿室。","“No, no.I’m getting hysterical.”And she seized her bag and coat and ran upstairs to the nursery."
"保姆给小贝洗完澡，她正坐在一张矮桌旁，喂小贝吃晚饭。婴儿穿一件白色法兰绒睡袍和一件蓝色羊毛短上衣，纤细的黑头发往上梳起，形成一个逗人发笑的小尖锥。她抬头看见妈妈，开始跳跃起来。","Nurse sat at a low table giving Little B her supper after her bath.The baby had on a white flannel gown and a blue woollen jacket, and her dark, fine hair was brushed up into a funny little peak.She looked up when she saw her mother and began to jump."
"“来，宝贝，吃完这点，做个乖女孩。”保姆说。伯莎看到保姆撅嘴的样子，明白这意味着她来婴儿室来得又不是时候。","“Now, my lovey, eat it up like a good girl,” said nurse, setting her lips in a way that Bertha knew, and that meant she had come into the nursery at another wrong moment."
"“她今天乖吗，阿姨？” ","“Has she been good, Nanny?”"
"“今天下午她一直都挺讨人喜欢。”保姆小声说。“我们到公园去了，我坐在椅子上，然后我从婴儿车里把她抱出来。一条大狗凑过来，把头靠在我的膝盖上，她就抓住狗耳朵，使劲拽。哎，您要能看到她那样子该多好。”","“She’s been a little sweet all the afternoon,” whispered Nanny.“We went to the park and I sat down on a chair and took her out of the pram and a big dog came along and put its head on my knee and she clutched its ear, tugged it.Oh, you should have seen her.”"
"伯莎想问问，让孩子抓一条陌生的狗的耳朵是否有点危险。不过，她没敢问。她两手垂立，看着她们，像个贫穷的小姑娘站在抱着洋娃娃的富家小姐跟前。","Bertha wanted to ask if it wasn’t rather dangerous to let her clutch at a strange dog’s ear.But she did not dare to.She stood watching them, her hands by her side, like the poor little girl in front of the rich girl with the doll."
"婴儿又抬起头看她，目不转睛地看着，然后笑了，笑得非常快活，伯莎禁不住大声说：","The baby looked up at her again, stared, and then smiled so charmingly that Bertha couldn’t help crying:"
"“噢，阿姨，让我来给她喂饭，你把洗澡的东西收拾好。”","“Oh, Nanny, do let me finish giving her her supper while you put the bath things away.”"
"“哎，太太，她吃饭的时候我们不该换人。”保姆还是那样小声说，“这样会打扰她，她可能会心烦意乱的。”","“Well, M’m, she oughtn’t to be changed hands while she’s eating,” said Nanny, still whispering.“It unsettles her; it’s very likely to upset her.”"
"这多可笑啊。如果非得把孩子放在——不是说像个稀有珍贵的提琴一样放在琴盒里——而是放在另一个女人的怀里，为什么还生个孩子呢？","How absurd it was.Why have a baby if it has to be kept—not in a case like a rare, rare fiddle—but in another woman’s arms?"
"“噢，我一定要喂！”她说。","“Oh, I must!” said she. "
"保姆心里很生气，不情愿地把婴儿交给了她。","Very offended, Nanny handed her over."
"“那好，吃完饭后别逗她。您知道您爱那样做，太太。事后我可就麻烦了！”","“Now, don’t excite her after her supper.You know you do, M’m.And I have such a time with her after!”"
"谢天谢地！保姆拿着浴巾走出了房间。","Thank heaven!Nanny went out of the room with the bath towels."
"“现在我可把你要回来了，我的小宝贝。”伯莎说，婴儿倚靠着她。","“Now I’ve got you to myself, my little precious,” said Bertha, as the baby leaned against her."
"婴儿高兴地吃着，鼓起嘴唇去接勺子，接着挥动两只小手。她时而抓着勺子不放，时而挥手把伯莎刚舀满的勺子推开，食物撒得四处都是。","She ate delightfully, holding up her lips for the spoon and then waving her hands.Sometimes she wouldn’t let the spoon go; and sometimes, just as Bertha had filled it, she waved it away to the four winds."
"婴儿喝完汤，伯莎转身面对火炉。“乖乖——你真乖！”她一边说，一边亲亲兴高采烈的婴儿。“妈妈喜欢你。妈妈爱你。”","When the soup was finished Bertha turned round to the fire.“You’re nice—you’re very nice!”“I’m fond of you.I like you.”"
"的确，她太爱小贝了——小家伙俯身向前露出脖子，纤巧的脚趾在炉火的映照下晶莹透亮——那种极端的幸福感又回到她身上，她还是不知道如何表达这种感受——不知拿它怎么办。","And indeed, she loved Little B so much—her neck as she bent forward, her exquisite toes as they shone transparent in the firelight—that all her feeling of bliss came back again, and again she didn’t know how to express it—what to do with it."
"“您的电话。”保姆得意而归，说着把小贝抱了过来。","“You’re wanted on the telephone,” said Nanny, coming back in triumph and seizing her Little B."
"她飞奔而下。是哈里的电话。","Down she flew.It was Harry."
"“噢，是你吗，伯莎？听我说。我会晚点到家。我会打的尽快回来，但是，推迟十分钟准备饭——好吗？说好啦？”","“Oh, is that you, Ber?Look here.I’ll be late.I’ll take a taxi and come along as quickly as I can, but get dinner put back ten minutes—will you?All right?”"
"“好，完全可以。噢，哈里！”","“Yes, perfectly.Oh, Harry!”"
"“就这样啦？”","“Yes?”"
"她想说什么？没话可说。她只想和他多交流一会儿。她总不能滑稽地大喊：“多么美妙的一天啊！”","What had she to say?She’d nothing to say.She only wanted to get in touch with him for a moment.She couldn’t absurdly cry: “Hasn’t it been a divine day!”"
"“怎么回事？”电话里突然传来微弱的声音。","“What is it?” rapped out the little voice."
"“没事。一言为定。”伯莎说完挂上话筒，琢磨着，还有什么比文明社会更加荒诞的呢。","“Nothing.Entendu,” said Bertha, and hung up the receiver, thinking how much more than idiotic civilisation was."
"他们有客人来吃晚饭。客人有诺曼·奈特夫妇——很有见地的一对——男的正打算开一家戏院，女的很喜欢室内装修。有个年轻小伙，叫埃迪·沃伦，刚刚出版了一本小小的诗集，大家都想邀请他吃饭。还有伯莎“发现”的朋友，名叫珀尔·富尔顿。富尔顿小姐做什么工作，伯莎并不知晓。她们在俱乐部相遇，伯莎一下就喜欢上了她，伯莎总是会喜欢上那些有点奇怪的漂亮女人。","They had people coming to dinner.The Norman Knights—a very sound couple—he was about to start a theatre, and she was awfully keen on interior decoration, a young man, Eddie Warren, who had just published a little book of poems and whom everybody was asking to dine, and a “find” of Bertha’s called Pearl Fulton.What Miss Fulton did, Bertha didn’t know.They had met at the club and Bertha had fallen in love with her, as she always did fall in love with beautiful women who had something strange about them."
"令人不愉快的是，尽管她们常在一块，见过很多次，也真心交流过，但伯莎还是弄不懂她。在某种程度上，富尔顿小姐有着难得的惊人的坦率。不过她有分寸，不会超过那个尺度。","The provoking thing was that, though they had been about together and met a number of times and really talked, Bertha couldn’t make her out.Up to a certain point Miss Fulton was rarely, wonderfully frank, but the certain point was there, and beyond that she would not go."
"有什么事隐藏着呢？哈里说：“没有。”他觉得她有点沉闷,“像所有金发女郎一样冷冰冰的，可能是有点大脑贫血吧。”但是伯莎不同意他的观点，至少现在还没同意。","Was there anything beyond it?Harry said “No.”Voted her dullish, and “cold like all blonde women, with a touch, perhaps, of anaemia of the brain.”But Bertha wouldn’t agree with him; not yet, at any rate."
"“不，她那种坐姿，头侧向一边，面带微笑，背后一定有事。哈里，我一定要弄清楚那到底是什么事。”","“No, the way she has of sitting with her head a little on one side, and smiling, has something behind it, Harry, and I must find out what that something is.”"
"“很可能就是胃口好饭量大。”哈里回答。","“Most likely it’s a good stomach,” answered Harry."
"他顺着伯莎的意思作出类似的回答……“肝冻伤了，我亲爱的”，或者“纯粹胀气”，或者“肾病”等等。","He made a point of catching Bertha’s heels with replies of that kind... “liver frozen, my dear girl,” or “pure flatulence,” or “kidney disease,”… and so on."
"出于某种奇怪的原因，伯莎喜欢他这样，而且可以说对他这点非常赞赏。","For some strange reason Bertha liked this, and almost admired it in him very much."
"她走进客厅，生了火；接着，把玛丽细心摆放好的坐垫一一拎起，又把它们扔回到椅子和长沙发上。这下就大不相同了，屋里立刻有了生气。她正准备把最后一个垫子扔出去，突然激动地、紧紧地抱住了它，让她自己都大吃一惊。但是这并没扑灭她心中的那团火。哎，正好相反！","She went into the drawing-room and lighted the fire; then, picking up the cushions, one by one, that Mary had disposed so carefully, she threw them back on to the chairs and the couches.That made all the difference; the room came alive at once.As she was about to throw the last one she surprised herself by suddenly hugging it to her, passionately, passionately.But it did not put out the fire in her bosom.Oh, on the contrary!"
"客厅的窗户通着阳台，在阳台上可以俯瞰花园。尽头靠墙的地方，有一棵高大、细长的梨树，花儿正开得繁盛；它亭亭玉立，在浅绿色的天空衬托下，仿佛静止不动。尽管望过去距离很远，伯莎还是情不自禁地认为那树上既没有一个花蕾，也没有一片凋落的花瓣。在下面花园的花坛里，开着红色和黄色的郁金香，花朵沉甸甸的，似乎在倚着暮色开放。一只灰猫拖着肚子从草坪爬过，另一只与它形影不离的黑猫尾随其后。看到它们那么专注，那么敏捷，伯莎不禁好奇地颤动了一下。","The windows of the drawing-room opened on to a balcony overlooking the garden.At the far end, against the wall, there was a tall, slender pear tree in fullest, richest bloom; it stood perfect, as though becalmed against the jade-green sky.Bertha couldn’t help feeling, even from this distance, that it had not a single bud or a faded petal.Down below, in the garden beds, the red and yellow tulips, heavy with flowers, seemed to lean upon the dusk.A grey cat, dragging its belly, crept across the lawn, and a black one, its shadow, trailed after.The sight of them, so intent and so quick, gave Bertha a curious shiver."
"“猫是多么恐怖的动物啊！”她结结巴巴地说着，转身离开窗户，开始来回踱步……","“What creepy things cats are!” she stammered, and she turned away from the window and began walking up and down...."
"在温暖的房间里，黄水仙散发的香味是那么浓烈。太浓啦？噢，不浓。可是，仿佛被花香熏倒了似的，她突然倒在沙发上，用手蒙住眼睛。","How strong the jonquils smelled in the warm room.Too strong?Oh, no.And yet, as though overcome, she flung down on a couch and pressed her hands to her eyes."
"“我太幸福——太幸福了！”她低语。","“I’m too happy—too happy!” she murmured."
"她似乎透过自己的眼帘看到了那棵惹人喜爱的梨树，满树花儿盛开，象征着她自己的生命。","And she seemed to see on her eyelids the lovely pear tree with its wide open blossoms as a symbol of her own life."
"的确——的确——她已拥有一切。她年轻。哈里和她还像从前那样相爱，他们琴瑟和谐，真是一对好伴侣。她有一个讨人喜欢的小宝贝。他们不必担心钱的问题。他们的住宅和花园也绝对令人满意。还有朋友们——时尚、令人激动的朋友，他们中有作家、画家、诗人，或者热衷于社会问题的人士——正是他们想要结交的那种类型的朋友。他们还有书和音乐；她还找到一个手艺极佳的小裁缝；夏天他们要去国外；他们的新厨师做的鸡蛋饼好吃极了……","Really—really—she had everything.She was young.Harry and she were as much in love as ever, and they got on together splendidly and were really good pals.She had an adorable baby.They didn’t have to worry about money.They had this absolutely satisfactory house and garden.And friends—modern, thrilling friends, writers and painters and poets or people keen on social questions—just the kind of friends they wanted.And then there were books, and there was music, and she had found a wonderful little dressmaker, and they were going abroad in the summer, and their new cook made the most superb omelettes...."
"“我真可笑。真可笑！”她坐了起来，但是感觉有点眩晕，像喝醉了酒。肯定是春天的缘故。","“I’m absurd.Absurd!”She sat up; but she felt quite dizzy, quite drunk.It must have been the spring."
"是的，是春天了。现在，她觉得好累，连爬上楼去换衣服的力气都没啦。","Yes, it was the spring.Now she was so tired she could not drag herself upstairs to dress."
"穿一件白色礼服，戴一串翡翠珠链，配绿色的鞋子和袜子。这也不算刻意打扮。她站在客厅窗口几个小时之前就想到这身搭配了。","A white dress, a string of jade beads, green shoes and stockings.It wasn’t intentional.She had thought of this scheme hours before she stood at the drawing-room window."
"她走进客厅，花瓣式的裙摆发出柔和的沙沙声。她吻了一下诺曼·奈特太太，这位太太正在脱下一件非常有趣的橘色大衣，底边和前身上面印着一排黑色的猴子。","Her petals rustled softly into the hall, and she kissed Mrs. Norman Knight, who was taking off the most amusing orange coat with a procession of black monkeys round the hem and up the fronts."
"“……哎呀！哎呀！中产阶级怎么就那么庸俗呢——完全没有一点幽默感！亲爱的，我能来到这儿纯属侥幸——幸亏有诺曼的保护。因为我身上这些可爱的猴子惹得火车上的人都很心烦，有一个男人竟然瞪着眼睛，几乎要把我吃掉。既不笑——也不觉得好笑——我还真希望他能笑能乐呢。不过，他并没那么做，他就那么盯着我——我彻底被烦死了。”","“... Why!Why!Why is the middle-class so stodgy—so utterly without a sense of humour!My dear, it’s only by a fluke that I am here at all—Norman being the protective fluke.For my darling monkeys so upset the train that it rose to a man and simply ate me with its eyes.Didn’t laugh—wasn’t amused—that I should have loved.No, just stared—and bored me through and through.”"
"“不过精彩的是，”诺曼一边说着，一边把一个大的单片玳瑁框眼镜压在眼窝，“你不介意我讲出来吧，厚脸皮？”（在家里或者在朋友们中间，他们互称“厚脸皮”和“鬼脸”。）“精彩的是，她烦得受不了的时候，转向她旁边的那个女人说：‘难道你从前没见过猴子吗？’”","“But the cream of it was,” said Norman, pressing a large tortoiseshell-rimmed monocle into his eye, “you don’t mind me telling this, Face, do you?”(In their home and among their friends they called each other Face and Mug.) “The cream of it was when she, being full fed, turned to the woman beside her and said: ‘Haven’t you ever seen a monkey before?’”"
"“噢，是这样！”诺曼太太和其他人一起大笑起来。“是不是太精彩啦？”","“Oh, yes!”Mrs. Norman Knight joined in the laughter.“Wasn’t that too absolutely creamy?”"
"更好笑的是，现在她脱了大衣，看起来还真像一个非常聪明的猴子——甚至她那黄色的丝绸礼服也像剥下来的香蕉皮做的。还有她那对琥珀耳坠，晃来晃去的就像两个小巧可爱的果仁。","And a funnier thing still was that now her coat was off she did look like a very intelligent monkey—who had even made that yellow silk dress out of scraped banana skins.And her amber ear-rings: they were like little dangling nuts."
"“这是一个悲凉的、令人忧愁的秋天！”“鬼脸”说着，停在小贝的儿童车前。“当那辆儿童车推进客厅时——”他挥挥手，没把剩下的半句引言说完。","“This is a sad, sad fall!” said Mug, pausing in front of Little B’s perambulator.“When the perambulator comes into the hall—” and he waved the rest of the quotation away."
"门铃响起来。进来的是瘦瘦的、脸色苍白的埃迪·沃伦，照旧是一副极其痛苦的神态。","The bell rang.It was lean, pale Eddie Warren (as usual) in a state of acute distress."
"“我找对门了，是吧？”他恳求地说。","“It is the right house, isn’t it?” he pleaded."
"“啊，我想是的——我希望是这样。”伯莎欢快地说。","“Oh, I think so—I hope so,” said Bertha brightly."
"“刚才我碰到一个出租车司机，那经历真是可怕，他特别凶恶。我根本没法让他停下来。我越敲打越喊他，他开得越快。月光下就看见这个古怪的家伙，低着个脑袋，缩在那个小方向盘上……”","“I have had such a dreadful experience with a taxi-man; he was most sinister.I couldn’t get him to stop.The more I knocked and called the faster he went.And in the moonlight this bizarre figure with the flattened head crouching over the little wheel... ”"
"他打了个寒战，摘下一条白色的大丝巾。伯莎注意到他的袜子也是白色的——非常可爱。","He shuddered, taking off an immense white silk scarf.Bertha noticed that his socks were white, too—most charming."
"“太恐怖了！”她大声说。","“But how dreadful!” she cried."
"“没错，的确如此。”埃迪说着，随她一起走进客厅。“我仿佛看到我自己坐着无始无终的出租车穿越‘永恒’。”","“Yes, it really was,” said Eddie, following her into the drawing-room.“I saw myself driving through Eternity in a timeless taxi.”"
"他与诺曼·奈特夫妇熟识。实际上，他打算等剧场计划顺利开展后，给诺曼·奈特写个剧本呢。","He knew the Norman Knights.In fact, he was going to write a play for N. K. when the theatre scheme came off.　"
"“喂，沃伦，剧本写得如何啦？”诺曼·奈特说着，摘掉他的单片眼镜，让眼睛恢复到原位，片刻之后又把镜片按上去。","“Well, Warren, how’s the play?” said Norman Knight, dropping his monocle and giving his eye a moment in which to rise to the surface before it was screwed down again."
"诺曼·奈特太太说：“噢，沃伦先生，这双袜子多好啊？”","And Mrs. Norman Knight: “Oh, Mr. Warren, what happy socks?”"
"“我很高兴你喜欢这双袜子。”他一边说，一边注视着自己的脚。“月亮升起来后，这双袜子就看起来更白了。”他转过他那清瘦的悲伤的脸对着伯莎。“有月亮，你知道吧。”","“I am so glad you like them,” said he, staring at his feet.“They seem to have got so much whiter since the moon rose.”And he turned his lean sorrowful young face to Bertha.“There is a moon, you know.”"
"她想大声喊起来：“肯定有啦——经常——经常有的！”","She wanted to cry: “I am sure there is—often—often!”"
"他的确是个非常有魅力的人。不过“厚脸皮”也一样迷人，她身着香蕉皮似的礼服，蜷缩在火炉边；“鬼脸”同样吸引人，他抽着烟，弹掉烟灰说：“新郎怎么还迟迟不来呀？”","He really was a most attractive person.But so was Face, crouched before the fire in her banana skins, and so was Mug, smoking a cigarette and saying as he flicked the ash: “Why doth the bridegroom tarry?”"
"“喏，他来了。”","“There he is, now.”"
"前门砰的一声打开又关上了。哈里喊道：“你们好啊。我五分钟后下来。”接着他们听见他迅速爬上楼梯。伯莎忍不住笑了；她知道他干什么都喜欢急急忙忙的。毕竟，再晚五分钟有什么要紧？可他偏要装作这事极其重要似的。接着他就会郑重其事地走进客厅，摆出一副格外沉着镇定的姿态。","Bang went the front door open and shut.Harry shouted: “Hullo, you people.Down in five minutes.”And they heard him swarm up the stairs.Bertha couldn’t help smiling; she knew how he loved doing things at high pressure.What, after all, did an extra five minutes matter?But he would pretend to himself that they mattered beyond measure.And then he would make a great point of coming into the drawing-room, extravagantly cool and collected."
"哈里对生活很有热情。啊，她是多么欣赏他身上这种热情啊！还有他拼搏奋斗的激情——他喜欢从碰到的所有困难中，考验自己的能力和勇气——这一点，她也明白。虽然有些时候，在那些不太了解他的人看来，他或许有点可笑……因为有时候他会在没有战役的地方匆忙上阵……她说说笑笑，完全忘了珀尔·富尔顿还没到，直到哈里走进来的时候才想起来（他那样子和她所想象的一样）。","Harry had such a zest for life.Oh, how she appreciated it in him.And his passion for fighting—for seeking in everything that came up against him another test of his power and of his courage—that, too, she understood.Even when it made him just occasionally, to other people, who didn’t know him well, a little ridiculous perhaps....For there were moments when he rushed into battle where no battle was....She talked and laughed and positively forgot until he had come in (just as she had imagined) that Pearl Fulton had not turned up."
"“我怀疑富尔顿小姐是不是忘了？”","“I wonder if Miss Fulton has forgotten?”"
"“我想是忘了，”哈里说，“给她打个电话吗？”","“I expect so,” said Harry. “Is she on the ‘phone’?”"
"“哎！过来一辆出租车。”伯莎笑了，表现出些许主人的姿态。当她发现的女朋友初次露面又很神秘的时候，她总是表现出这样的神态。“她在出租车里过日子。”","“Ah!There’s a taxi, now.”And Bertha smiled with that little air of proprietorship that she always assumed while her women finds were new and mysterious.“She lives in taxis.”"
"“要是那样的话她会变胖的，”哈里冷淡地说，摇铃示意开饭,“那对金发女郎来说是可怕的危险。”","“She’ll run to fat if she does,” said Harry coolly, ringing the bell for dinner. “Frightful danger for blonde women.”"
"“哈里——别说啦！”伯莎笑着警告他。","“Harry—don’t!” warned Bertha, laughing up at him."
"他们说说笑笑地又等了一小会儿，有点过于无拘无束，但他们也没有察觉到这点。这时富尔顿小姐身着银色礼服，一条银色的发带系着浅黄色的头发，笑吟吟地走进来，头微微偏向一侧。","Came another tiny moment, while they waited, laughing and talking, just a trifle too much at their ease, a trifle too unaware.And then Miss Fulton, all in silver, with a silver fillet binding her pale blonde hair, came in smiling, her head a little on one side."
"“我来晚了吧？”“不晚，一点也不晚，”伯莎说，“过来吧。”","“Am I late?”“No, not at all,” said Bertha. “Come along.”"
"她搀起富尔顿小姐的胳膊，走进饭厅。","And she took her arm and they moved into the dining-room."
"当她触到那条冰凉的胳膊时，伯莎心里那个地方又被扇动起来——扇动着——开始燃烧——燃烧——那团幸福的火焰，伯莎真不知该拿它怎么办？","What was there in the touch of that cool arm that could fan—fan—start blazing—blazing—the fire of bliss that Bertha did not know what to do with?"
"富尔顿小姐没有看她，不过她确实很少直视他人。她那厚重的眼皮垂在眼睛上，半露微笑，那奇怪的笑容在唇间时隐时现，好像她的生活是靠听而非靠看似的。然而伯莎突然明白了，好像她们曾经有过最长时间的最亲密的对视——好像两人都问过对方：“你也这样？”——她明白珀尔·富尔顿在搅动着灰色汤盘里那红色的汤时，正体验着与自己相同的感受。","Miss Fulton did not look at her; but then she seldom did look at people directly.Her heavy eyelids lay upon her eyes and the strange half-smile came and went upon her lips as though she lived by listening rather than seeing.But Bertha knew, suddenly, as if the longest, most intimate look had passed between them—as if they had said to each other: “You too?”—that Pearl Fulton, stirring the beautiful red soup in the grey plate, was feeling just what she was feeling."
"其他人呢？“厚脸皮”和“鬼脸”，埃迪和哈里，他们的汤勺起起落落——他们用餐巾轻拭嘴唇，掰开面包，摆弄着叉子和酒杯，谈天说地。","And the others?Face and Mug, Eddie and Harry, their spoons rising and falling—dabbing their lips with their napkins, crumbling bread, fiddling with the forks and glasses and talking."
"“我是在阿尔法展览会上遇到她的——她长得小，但是最古怪。她不仅剪短了头发，而且更可怕的是，她还剃光了腿、胳膊和脖子上的汗毛，甚至她那可怜的小鼻子上的汗毛都剃掉了。”","“I met her at the Alpha show—the weirdest little person.She’d not only cut off her hair, but she seemed to have taken a dreadfully good snip off her legs and arms and her neck and her poor little nose as well.”"
"“她不是和迈克尔·奥特关系很密切吗？”","“Isn’t she very liée with Michael Oat?”"
"“是写《戴假牙的情人》的那个人吗？”","“The man who wrote Love in False Teeth?”"
"“他想给我写个剧本。一个独幕剧。就一个男人。他决定要自杀。他列出了他应该自杀和不该自杀的所有理由。就在他下决心自杀还是不自杀的时候——落幕。构思很好。”","“He wants to write a play for me.One act.One man.Decides to commit suicide.Gives all the reasons why he should and why he shouldn’t.And just as he has made up his mind either to do it or not to do it—curtain.Not half a bad idea.”"
"“他要给这个剧本取什么题目——是《吃多了吗》？”","“What’s he going to call it—‘Stomach Trouble’?”"
"“我觉得我在一本不起眼的法国杂志上看到过类似的想法，但这本杂志在英国几乎无人知晓。”","“I think I’ve come across the same idea in a little French review, quite unknown in England.”"
"唉，他们都没有体会到她的感受。他们都是惹人喜爱的人——惹人喜爱的人——她喜欢让他们来她家吃饭，用美食好酒招待他们。实际上，她很想告诉大家他们有多招人喜欢，他们组合在一起让整个屋子都亮了起来，他们相互衬托，使她想起契诃夫的一场戏剧。","No, they didn’t share it.They were dears—dears—and she loved having them there, at her table, and giving them delicious food and wine.In fact, she longed to tell them how delightful they were, and what a decorative group they made, how they seemed to set one another off and how they reminded her of a play by Chekhov!"
"哈里正在享用他的晚餐。这是他这个人的一部分——噢，这不是他的天性，不过准确地说他也没有装模作样——是他的——某种嗜好就对了——他喜欢谈论吃喝，得意地说着自己“对龙虾白肉那种自己都觉得羞愧的馋劲儿”，还有“对绿色的开心果冰淇淋的那份喜爱——翠绿冰凉，就像埃及舞蹈演员的眼皮一样”。","Harry was enjoying his dinner.It was part of his—well, not his nature, exactly, and certainly not his pose—his—something or other—to talk about food and to glory in his “shameless passion for the white flash of the lobster” and “the green of pistachio ices—green and cold like the eyelids of Egyptian dancers.”"
"他抬起头看着她说：“伯莎，这蛋奶酥很值得称赞！”她高兴得像个孩子，差点掉下眼泪。","When he looked up at her and said: “Bertha, this is a very admirable soufflée!”she almost could have wept with child-like pleasure."
"啊，为什么今晚她对整个世界都这么怜爱？一切都令人满意——恰到好处。所有发生的事情似乎把她那斟满幸福的杯子又注满了一次。","Oh, why did she feel so tender towards the whole world tonight?Everything was good—was right.All that happened seemed to fill again her brimming cup of bliss."
"但是，那棵梨树依然在她的心底里。现在，在可怜的埃迪谈起的月光下，那棵梨树应该是一树银白，就像富尔顿小姐那身银白的装束一样。富尔顿小姐坐在那儿，用纤细的手指转动着一个橘子，她的手指那样白，像能发出亮光似的。","And still, in the back of her mind, there was the pear tree.It would be silver now, in the light of poor dear Eddie’s moon, silver as Miss Fulton, who sat there turning a tangerine in her slender fingers that were so pale a light seemed to come from them."
"她只是弄不明白——不可思议的是——她怎么会猜中富尔顿小姐的心绪，且猜得又快又准。她一刻也未怀疑过自己的判断，可是她根据什么来判断的呢？什么根据都没有。","What she simply couldn’t make out—what was miraculous—was how she should have guessed Miss Fulton’s mood so exactly and so instantly.For she never doubted for a moment that she was right, and yet what had she to go on?Less than nothing."
"“我想这种情况在女人之间确实极少极少发生。男人之间从来就没有出现过。”伯莎想,“不过我去客厅煮咖啡时，也许她会‘示意’的。”","“I believe this does happen very, very rarely between women.Never between men,” thought Bertha. “But while I am making the coffee in the drawing-room perhaps she will ‘give a sign. ’”"
"她不知道她那样做是何用意，也想象不出之后会发生什么事。","What she meant by that she did not know, and what would happen after that she could not imagine."
"她这样想着，同时发觉自己又说又笑的。她不得不继续说话，不然她总想笑。","While she thought like this she saw herself talking and laughing.She had to talk because of her desire to laugh."
"“我得笑，要不就得死。”","“I must laugh or die.”"
"当她注意到“厚脸皮”的一个可笑的习惯性小动作，老是把什么东西塞到紧身上衣的下面——仿佛她也在那儿秘密贮藏了些果仁似的——伯莎只得用指甲戳自己的手——这样才不至于笑得太厉害。","But when she noticed Face’s funny little habit of tucking something down the front of her bodice—as if she kept a tiny, secret hoard of nuts there, too—Bertha had to dig her nails into her hands—so as not to laugh too much."
"宴会终于散了。伯莎说：“来看看我那新咖啡机吧。”","It was over at last.And: “Come and see my new coffee machine,” said Bertha."
"“我们每两周才更换一次新咖啡机。”哈里说。这次“厚脸皮”挽起她的胳膊；富尔顿小姐低头跟随着。","“We only have a new coffee machine once a fortnight,” said Harry.Face took her arm this time; Miss Fulton bent her head and followed after."
"客厅里的炉火已经熄灭了，仅剩一点儿红色的余烬若隐若现。“小凤凰巢，”“厚脸皮”说。","The fire had died down in the drawing-room to a red, flickering “nest of baby phoenixes,” said Face."
"“等会儿再开灯。这样多美呀。”接着，她又蹲在炉火旁边了。她总是觉得冷……“她没穿那件短小的红色法兰绒上衣，当然冷了。”伯莎想。　","“Don’t turn up the light for a moment. It is so lovely.”And down she crouched by the fire again.She was always cold... “without her little red flannel jacket, of course,” thought Bertha."
"就在这时，富尔顿小姐“示意”了。","At that moment Miss Fulton “gave the sign.”"
"“你们有个花园吗？”说话者的嗓音冷冰冰、懒洋洋的。","“Have you a garden?” said the cool, sleepy voice."
"她的口吻如此高雅，伯莎也就只有遵从的份了。她穿过房间，打开窗帘，敞开那些长窗。","This was so exquisite on her part that all Bertha could do was to obey.She crossed the room, pulled the curtains apart, and opened those long windows."
"“在那儿！”她低语道。","“There!” she breathed."
"两个女人肩并肩地站着观看那株颀长的缀满繁花的树。尽管那棵树看起来静止未动，可她们看着看着，那棵树就成了蜡烛的火焰，在明澈的空中颤动着，伸展着，尖头往上蹿，越长越高——几乎触到那银白的圆月的边缘了。","And the two women stood side by side looking at the slender, flowering tree.Although it was so still it seemed, like the flame of a candle, to stretch up, to point, to quiver in the bright air, to grow taller and taller as they gazed—almost to touch the rim of the round, silver moon."
"她们在那儿站了多长时间？她们是被那神秘的光环吸住了吗？她们心心相印，如同来自另一个世界的人，想知道她们会在这个世界做什么？所有充满幸福的珍宝都在她们的心中燃烧着，像银白的花朵一般从她们的发丝和双手滑落。","How long did they stand there?Both, as it were, caught in that circle of unearthly light, understanding each other perfectly, creatures of another world, and wondering what they were to do in this one with all this blissful treasure that burned in their bosoms and dropped, in silver flowers, from their hair and hands?"
"是永远——还是片刻？富尔顿小姐在低语：“是的，就是这样。”还是伯莎梦见的这一切？","For ever—for a moment?And did Miss Fulton murmur: “Yes. Just that.” Or did Bertha dream it?"
"这时灯突然间亮了，“厚脸皮”在冲咖啡，哈里说：“亲爱的奈特太太，别问我有关孩子的情况。我从不看她。在她有爱人之前，我根本不会对她有兴趣的。”“鬼脸”摘下单片眼镜，让眼睛从镜片下面的“暖房”里出来片刻，然后又把镜片按上去。埃迪·沃伦在喝咖啡，他一脸痛苦地放下杯子，仿佛喝醉了，还看到了一只蜘蛛。","Then the light was snapped on and Face made the coffee and Harry said: “My dear Mrs. Knight, don’t ask me about my baby.I never see her.I shan’t feel the slightest interest in her until she has a lover,” and Mug took his eye out of the conservatory for a moment and then put it under glass again and Eddie Warren drank his coffee and set down the cup with a face of anguish as though he had drunk and seen the spider."
"“我想做的就是要让年轻人表现表现。我相信伦敦还有大量的没有写出来的一流剧本。我想对他们说的是：‘戏院就在这儿。开始干吧。’”","“What I want to do is to give the young men a show.I believe London is simply teeming with first-chop, unwritten plays.What I want to say to ’em is: ‘Here’s the theatre. Fire ahead.’”"
"“你知道，亲爱的，我要为雅各布·内森家装修一个房间。噢，我特别想搞一个煎鱼的图案设计，把椅背做成煎锅的形状，在窗帘上绣满漂亮的炸土豆片。”","“You know, my dear, I am going to decorate a room for the Jacob Nathans.Oh, I am so tempted to do a fried fish scheme, with the backs of the chairs shaped like frying-pans and lovely chip potatoes embroidered all over the curtains.”"
"“我们年轻作家的问题是他们还太浪漫。想要出海难免会晕船，需要找个痰盂呕吐。哎，为什么他们就没有勇气做个痰盂呢？”","“The trouble with our young writing men is that they are still too romantic.You can’t put out to sea without being seasick and wanting a basin.Well, why won’t they have the courage of those basins?”"
"“有一首可怕的诗，写一个女孩在小树林里被一个没鼻子的乞丐强奸……”","“A dreadful poem about a girl who was violated by a beggar without a nose in a little wood....”"
"富尔顿小姐坐在那个最低最深的椅子上，哈里给每个人递烟。","Miss Fulton sank into the lowest, deepest chair and Harry handed round the cigarettes."
"他晃动着银烟盒站在她面前，粗鲁地说：“抽埃及烟？土耳其烟？还是弗吉尼亚烟？全混在一起了。”伯莎从他那样子意识到他不是厌烦富尔顿小姐，而且非常厌恶她。富尔顿小姐说：“不用，谢谢，我不吸烟。”伯莎从富尔顿小姐回答的语气判断出，她也感觉到了这一点，且颇感不快。","From the way he stood in front of her shaking the silver box and saying abruptly: “Egyptian? Turkish? Virginian?  They’re all mixed up,” Bertha realised that she not only bored him; he really disliked her.And she decided from the way Miss Fulton said: “No, thank you, I won’t smoke,” that she felt it, too, and was hurt."
"“唉。哈里，别讨厌她。你这样对她是不公平的。她是个很好很好的人。况且，对我来说那么重要的人，你怎么会对她感觉那么不同呢？今晚上床睡觉时我会设法告诉你之前发生的事情，我和她有着怎样的共鸣。”","“Oh, Harry, don’t dislike her.You are quite wrong about her.She’s wonderful, wonderful.And, besides, how can you feel so differently about someone who means so much to me.I shall try to tell you when we are in bed tonight what has been happening.What she and I have shared.”"
"伯莎想着这些，脑子里突然冒出一个奇怪且有些骇人的念头。这个没有理智的念头微笑着对她耳语：“这些人很快就走了。房间里会变得静悄悄的——静悄悄的。灯都熄了。只剩下你和他一起在这黑暗的房间里——温暖的床上……”","At those last words something strange and almost terrifying darted into Bertha’s mind.And this something blind and smiling whispered to her: “Soon these people will go.The house will be quiet—quiet.The lights will be out.And you and he will be alone together in the dark room—the warm bed....”"
"她突然从椅子上站起来，奔向那架钢琴。","She jumped up from her chair and ran over to the piano."
"“没人弹琴，太可惜了！”她大声说，“没人弹琴，太可惜了。”","“What a pity someone does not play!” she cried.“What a pity somebody does not play.”"
"伯莎·扬平生第一次想要自己的丈夫。噢，她爱他——她一直都爱他，当然是以其他各种方式，而不是现在这种方式。当然她也同样理解，他与她不同。他们时常谈到这一点。起初她发现自己那么冷淡还特别担心，但是过了一段时间后这事似乎也没什么大不了的了。他们彼此之间非常坦白——是一对好伴侣。这是新式夫妻最好的一点。","For the first time in her life Bertha Young desired her husband.Oh, she’d loved him—she’d been in love with him, of course, in every other way, but just not in that way.And equally, of course, she’d understood that he was different.They’d discussed it so often.It had worried her dreadfully at first to find that she was so cold, but after a time it had not seemed to matter.They were so frank with each other—such good pals.That was the best of being modern."
"但是现在——太强烈了！太强烈了！这个词使她那欲火燃烧的身体痛苦不安！这都是那种幸福感所导致的吗？但是这时，就在这时——诺曼·奈特太太说：“亲爱的，你知道我们的尴尬。我们受时间和火车的约束，得回去了。我们住在汉普斯特德。今晚过得很愉快。”","But now—ardently!ardently!The word ached in her ardent body!Was this what that feeling of bliss had been leading up to?But then, then—“My dear,” said Mrs. Norman Knight, “you know our shame.We are the victims of time and train.We live in Hampstead.It’s been so nice.”"
"“我送你们到门厅。”伯莎说。“我真喜欢和你们在一起。可你们不能错过最后一班火车。真糟糕，是吧？”","“I’ll come with you into the hall,” said Bertha.“I loved having you.But you must not miss the last train.That’s so awful, isn’t it?”"
"“奈特，走之前再喝杯威士忌吧？”哈里喊道。","“Have a whisky, Knight, before you go?” called Harry."
"“不了，谢谢，老弟。”","“No, thanks, old chap.”"
"伯莎听了用力握了握他的手。","Bertha squeezed his hand for that as she shook it."
"“晚安，再见吧。”她站在最高的那级台阶上喊着，感觉自己在和他们永别似的。","“Good night, good-bye,” she cried from the top step, feeling that this self of hers was taking leave of them for ever."
"当她回到客厅时，其他人也准备离开了。","When she got back into the drawing-room the others were on the move."
"“……那么你顺路搭一段我叫的出租车好了。”","“... Then you can come part of the way in my taxi.”"
"“刚才遭遇了那么可怕的经历，现在我真要感激你，我不用受独自乘车的罪了。”","“I shall be so thankful not to have to face another drive alone after my dreadful experience.”"
"“你可以在这条街尽头的出租车停车处叫到出租车。走不了几步就到。”","“You can get a taxi at the rank just at the end of the street.You won’t have to walk more than a few yards.”"
"“那太便捷了。我去穿上外套。”","“That’s a comfort. I’ll go and put on my coat.”"
"富尔顿小姐向门厅走去，伯莎正在后面跟着，这时哈里几乎是从旁边挤过来。","Miss Fulton moved towards the hall and Bertha was following when Harry almost pushed past."
"“让我帮你穿。”","“Let me help you.”"
"伯莎知道他对自己的粗蛮感到懊悔——就由他去了。他在某些方面就像个孩子——那么冲动——那么——天真。","Bertha knew that he was repenting his rudeness—she let him go.What a boy he was in some ways—so impulsive—so—simple."
"火炉旁只剩下她和埃迪了。","And Eddie and she were left by the fire."
"“我不知道你是否看过比尔克斯的新诗《客宴》。”埃迪轻轻地说。“写得特别棒。在最近出版的诗集里发表的。你有这本诗集吗？我很想给你看看。开头是这样一行极美的诗句：‘为何总得喝番茄汤？’”","“I wonder if you have seen Bilks’ new poem called Table d’Hote,” said Eddie softly.“It’s so wonderful.In the last Anthology.Have you got a copy?I’d so like to show it to you.It begins with an incredibly beautiful line: ‘Why Must it Always be Tomato Soup?’”"
"“我有的。”伯莎说。她悄无声息地走到客厅门口对面的桌子前，埃迪也悄无声息地跟随她走过来。她挑出那本小书交给他；他们没出一点声响。","“Yes,” said Bertha.And she moved noiselessly to a table opposite the drawing-room door and Eddie glided noiselessly after her.She picked up the little book and gave it to him; they had not made a sound."
"在他翻阅那本书的时候，她扭头向门厅望去。她瞧见……哈里抱着富尔顿小姐的外套，富尔顿小姐背对着他，垂着头。他抛开那件外套，把手放在她的肩膀上，突然用力把她扳过来对着他。他嘴上说：“我太喜欢你了。”富尔顿小姐把她那月光般的手指贴在哈里的面颊上，睡眼朦胧地微笑着。哈里鼻孔微颤，他咧着嘴，笑起来很难看，然后又低声说：“明天。”富尔顿小姐动了动眼皮示意道：“好的。”","While he looked it up she turned her head towards the hall.And she saw... Harry with Miss Fulton’s coat in his arms and Miss Fulton with her back turned to him and her head bent.He tossed the coat away, put his hands on her shoulders and turned her violently to him.His lips said: “I adore you,” and Miss Fulton laid her moonbeam fingers on his cheeks and smiled her sleepy smile.Harry’s nostrils quivered; his lips curled back in a hideous grin while he whispered: “Tomorrow,” and with her eyelids Miss Fulton said: “Yes.”"
"“在这儿呢。”埃迪说。“‘为何总得喝番茄汤？’难道你不觉得这句诗深刻准确吗？番茄汤简直变成永远不变的了。”","“Here it is,” said Eddie.“‘Why Must it Always be Tomato Soup?’It’s so deeply true, don’t you feel?Tomato soup is so dreadfully eternal.”"
"“要是你乐意的话，”哈里高声说道，话音从门厅里传过来，“我可以给你打电话，把出租车叫到门口来。”","“If you prefer,” said Harry’s voice, very loud, from the hall, “I can phone you a cab to come to the door.”"
"“噢，不，不必了。”富尔顿小姐说着向伯莎走来，伸出细长的手指来和伯莎握手。","“Oh, no. It’s not necessary,” said Miss Fulton, and she came up to Bertha and gave her the slender fingers to hold."
"“再会啦。非常感谢。”","“Good-bye. Thank you so much.”"
"“再会。”伯莎说。","“Good-bye,” said Bertha."
"富尔顿小姐多握了一会儿她的手。","Miss Fulton held her hand a moment longer."
"“你那株梨树可真美！”她喁喁细语。","“Your lovely pear tree!” she murmured."
"然后她走了，埃迪跟着她，就像那只黑猫跟随着那只灰猫。","And then she was gone, with Eddie following, like the black cat following the grey cat."
"“我要关门啦。”哈里说着，显得分外冷静镇定。","“I’ll shut up shop,” said Harry, extravagantly cool and collected."
"“你那株漂亮的梨树——梨树——梨树！”","“Your lovely pear tree—pear tree—pear tree!”"
"伯莎径直跑到长窗前面。","Bertha simply ran over to the long windows."
"“噢，现在会有什么事发生呢？”她叫道。","“Oh, what is going to happen now?” she cried."
"但是那株梨树依然那么美丽，花开满树，静立如初。","But the pear tree was as lovely as ever and as full of flower and as still."
