		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一美元八十七美分。这就是全部了。并且其中的六十美分全都是一分一分的硬币。这些一分的硬币是和杂货店老板、菜贩子和肉店老板软磨硬泡一个一个省下来的，直弄得自己面颊发烫、羞愧难当，对方虽未明说，却显然对这种讨价还价的吝啬行为满是责难。德拉数了三遍。依旧是一美元八十七美分。而转天就是圣诞节了。</td>
		<td class="en">ONE dollar and eighty-seven cents.That was all.And sixty cents of it was in pennies.Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied.Three times Della counted it.One dollar and eighty-seven cents.And the next day would be Christmas.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >显然，除了跌坐在破旧的小沙发上哀号，她别无他法了。而这引发了精神上的思考，即生活由哭泣、抽噎和微笑组成，尤以抽噎为最。</td>
		<td class="en">There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl.So Della did it.Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这家的女主人逐渐平静了下来，我们来看看这个家吧。一套每周八美元带家具的公寓。它虽不能说穷得难以形容，但也确实与丐帮相差无几。</td>
		<td class="en">While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home.A furnished flat at $8 per week.It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >下面的门厅里有一个从来没放过信件的信箱，还有一个从来没有人的手指按响过的电铃按钮。那上面还附着一张卡片，写着名字“詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·杨先生”。</td>
		<td class="en">In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring.Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name “Mr. James Dillingham Young.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“迪林厄姆”这个名号是它的主人昔日春风得意时加上去的，那段富裕时期，他每周挣三十美元。现在，当收入缩减到二十美元，它们似乎正严肃地思考着缩写成谦逊而不招摇的字母“D”。但只要詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·杨先生一回家，走上楼上的公寓，詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·杨夫人，就是已经介绍给大家的德拉，就会叫他“吉姆”，并且给他一个大大的拥抱。那是再好不过的了。</td>
		<td class="en">The “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week.Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called “Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della.Which is all very good.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >德拉哭完之后，用粉饼在面颊上扑了点粉。她站在窗边，呆呆地望着，一只灰猫正在灰色院子里的同是灰色的篱笆上走着。明天就是圣诞节了，而她只有一美元八十七美分给吉姆买份礼物。几个月来，她尽力一分一分地省着，却是这样的结果。一周二十美元花不了多久。花销总是比她预算的要多。总是这样的。只有一块八毛七给吉姆买礼物。她的吉姆。很长时间以来，她高兴地计划着要给吉姆买件称心的礼物。一件精致、稀少，而且有品位的礼物——一件基本上能够配得上吉姆所有东西的礼物。</td>
		<td class="en">Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag.She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard.Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present.She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result.Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far.Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.They always are.Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim.Her Jim.Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him.Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >房间的窗户之间有面穿衣镜。或许你见过房租每周八美元公寓里的穿衣镜。一个非常瘦小、动作灵活的人通过观察自己在一连串快速纵条中的影像，可以对自己的容貌有个大致精确的概念。德拉身材苗条，已经掌握了这门艺术。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a pier glass between the windows of the room.Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat.A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks.Della, being slender, had mastered the art.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然她从窗前迅速转身，站在镜子前面。她的眼睛闪闪发光，但她的面色在二十秒内失去了光彩。她迅速地放下头发，使之披散开来。</td>
		<td class="en">Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass.Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds.Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·杨家里拥有两件他们特别引以为傲的东西。一件是经吉姆的祖父和父亲传下来的金表。另一件是德拉的头发。如果示巴女王住在通风井对面的公寓，德拉会在某一天将头发垂散到窗外去晾干，就为了使那女王的珠宝全都黯然失色。如果所罗门国王是守门人，看守堆在地下室里的金银财宝的话，吉姆每次经过时都会亮出他的表，好看看他嫉妒得直拽胡子。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride.One was Jim’s gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s.The other was Della’s hair.Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty’s jewels and gifts.Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而现在，德拉的秀发披散在她的周围，微波起伏，闪烁着光芒，犹如褐色的瀑布。它长及膝下，几乎成了她的一件长袍。然后，她又紧张而迅速地把头发梳起来。她犹豫了一分钟，静静地站着，一两滴眼泪溅落在破旧的红地毯上。</td>
		<td class="en">So now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters.It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her.And then she did it up again nervously and quickly.Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她穿上褐色的旧外套，戴上褐色的旧帽子。眼睛里闪着晶莹的泪光，她将裙子一摆，飘出了房门，下楼来到了街上。</td>
		<td class="en">On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat.With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她停在一处招牌前，上写着：“索芙朗妮夫人。</td>
		<td class="en">Where she stopped the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >经营各式头发。”德拉跑上楼，镇定了一下，喘了口气。那位夫人身体庞大，过于苍白，寒气逼人，一点都不像“索芙朗妮”。</td>
		<td class="en">Hair Goods of All Kinds.”One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting.Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the “Sofronie.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你愿意买我的头发吗？”德拉问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Will you buy my hair?”asked Della.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我买头发。”夫人说。“摘掉帽子，让我看看头发的成色。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I buy hair,” said Madame.“Take yer hat off and let’s have a sight at the looks of it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那褐色的瀑布倾泻而下。</td>
		<td class="en">Down rippled the brown cascade.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“二十美元。”夫人内行地抓起头发说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“快点给我钱。”德拉说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Give it to me quick,” said Della.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >噢，接下来的两个小时如同长了玫瑰色的翅膀飞逝而过。忘了这糟糕的比喻吧。她正在仔细搜寻各家店铺为吉姆买礼物。</td>
		<td class="en">Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings.Forget the hashed metaphor.She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s present.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她终于找到了。它一定是为吉姆、而非为其他任何人准备的。她已经把所有的店铺翻了个底朝天，哪家也没有这样的东西。那是一条白金表链，设计简单。如同一切优质东西那样——它通过材质本身恰如其分地显示着自己的价值，而不是靠什么俗气的装饰。它正配得上那只表。她一看到它就知道它一定得是吉姆的。它就像他本人。安静而有价值——这一形容对两者都很恰当。她花了二十一美元买下了它，然后她匆匆忙忙赶回家，只剩下了八十七美分。吉姆戴上金表，配上这条链子，在任何场合都可以适时地看时间了。那表虽然贵重，但他有时看表时只是偷偷地看一眼，因为他没用表链，而只是一条破旧的皮革带子。</td>
		<td class="en">She found it at last.It surely had been made for Jim and no one else.There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out.It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do.It was even worthy of The Watch.As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim’s.It was like him.Quietness and value—the description applied to both.Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents.With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company.Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >德拉回到家后，她的狂喜渐渐被谨慎和理性所取代。她取出卷发钳，点燃煤气，开始修补那由爱情的慷慨所造成的破坏。这永远是一项艰巨的任务，亲爱的朋友们——一项极其艰巨的任务。</td>
		<td class="en">When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason.She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love.Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >四十分钟内，她的头上就布满了密集的小卷，这使她看起来像极了一个逃学的小男孩。她长时间地看着镜子中自己，小心地、挑剔地照着。</td>
		<td class="en">Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy.She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要是吉姆看我一眼而没杀我的话，”她自言自语道，“他一定会说我看起来像是科尼岛上的合唱团女孩。但我能怎么办呢——噢！只有一块八毛七，我能怎么办呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he takes a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl.But what could I do—oh!what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >七点钟，她煮好了咖啡，把煎锅放在热炉上，准备做肉排。</td>
		<td class="en">At 7 o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆从未晚归。德拉把表链对折握在手里，坐在门边的桌子旁，他总是从这扇门进来。然后她听到下面的楼梯上响起了他的脚步声，她的脸色立刻煞白。她习惯于为最简单的日常小事默默地做祷告，此刻，她低声念道：“上帝啊，请让他觉得我依然漂亮。”</td>
		<td class="en">Jim was never late.Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered.Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment.She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make him think I am still pretty.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >门开了，吉姆进来，关上了门。他看起来瘦削，而且非常严肃。可怜的家伙，他才二十二岁，就得负担起一个家庭。他需要一件新外套，他连手套都没有呢。</td>
		<td class="en">The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it.He looked thin and very serious.Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened with a family!He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆站在门内，好像猎狗闻到了鹌鹑的气味一样一动不动。他的眼睛盯在德拉身上，眼睛里有种她无法读懂的神情，那神情吓住了她。那不是愤怒，不是惊讶，不是批评，不是憎恶，不是她所预料到的任何情感。他只是面带那古怪的表情死死地盯着她。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail.His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her.It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for.He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >德拉身子一扭，离开桌子走向他。</td>
		<td class="en">Della wriggled off the table and went for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“吉姆，亲爱的。”她叫道，“别那样看着我。我把头发剪了卖了，因为不送你件礼物，我没法过圣诞节。它还会长起来的——你不会介意的，不是吗？我不得不这么做。我的头发长得惊人地快。说‘圣诞快乐！’吉姆，让我们高兴点儿。你不知道我给你买了一件多么漂亮——多么精致的礼物。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way.I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn’t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present.It’ll grow out again—you won’t mind, will you?I just had to do it.My hair grows awfully fast.Say ‘Merry Christmas!’Jim, and let’s be happy.You don’t know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I’ve got for you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你剪掉了头发？”吉姆费力地问道，似乎他绞尽脑汁也没想明白这再明显不过的事实。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ve cut off your hair?”asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“剪掉卖了。”德拉说，“不管怎样，你不是还是一样喜欢我吗？没有了头发，我还是我，不是吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Cut it off and sold it,” said Della.“Don’t you like me just as well, anyhow?I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆不解地看看屋子。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim looked about the room curiously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你说你的头发没了？”他带着一种几乎是白痴的表情问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“You say your hair is gone?”he said, with an air almost of idiocy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不用找了。”德拉说，“我告诉你，我已经卖了——卖了，没了。这是圣诞前夜呀，宝贝。对我好点，因为它是为你而没的呀。或许我头上的头发数得清。”她突然非常温柔地接下去，“但没有人能数得清我对你的爱。我可以做肉排了吗？吉姆。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You needn’t look for it,” said Della.“It’s sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too.It’s Christmas Eve, boy.Be good to me, for it went for you.Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,” she went on with sudden serious sweetness, “but nobody could ever count my love for you.Shall I put the chops on, Jim?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆好像从恍惚中突然醒来。他紧紧地抱住德拉。让我们花十秒钟换个角度来慎重地审查一些无关紧要的事。一周8美元或是一年一百万美元——有什么区别呢？数学家或智者会给你错误的答案。麦琪带来了贵重的礼物，但就是没有那件东西。这个晦涩的说法会在后文加以说明。</td>
		<td class="en">Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake.He enfolded his Della.For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction.Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is the difference?A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer.The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them.This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆从外套口袋里拿出一个小包，把它扔到桌上。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别误会我，德尔。”他说，“我觉得发式、修面或者洗头发都不能减少一丝我对妻子的爱慕。但如果你打开那个包裹，你就会知道我刚才为什么那么吃惊了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t make any mistake, Dell,” he said, “about me.I don’t think there’s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less.But if you’ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >白皙的手指灵巧地解开带子、翻开纸包。然后，发出了狂喜的尖叫声，再然后，天哪！突然转变成了女性特有的神经质的泪水和哀号，急需这公寓的男主人立刻使用浑身解数来安慰。</td>
		<td class="en">White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper.And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas!a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为那儿放着的是梳子——一组梳子，包括两鬓和后面用的。那可是德拉已经在百老汇的橱窗里膜拜了很久的梳子。这些美丽的梳子是纯玳瑁做的，边缘镶着宝石——其色彩正适合于戴在她那消失了的秀发上。她知道这套梳子很贵，所以她心里只是羡慕着，渴望着，从未想到过要据为己有。而现在，它们是她的了，但那用来佩戴这梦寐以求的饰物的长发已经荡然无存了。</td>
		<td class="en">For there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window.Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims—just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair.They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession.And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但她还是把它们抱在胸前，终于，她抬起湿润的双眼，微笑着说：“我的头发长得非常快，吉姆！”</td>
		<td class="en">But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: “My hair grows so fast, Jim!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，德拉像一只被火烫着了的小猫跳起来叫道：“噢，噢！”</td>
		<td class="en">And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, “Oh, oh!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆还没看见他的漂亮礼物呢。她急切地摊开手掌，伸到他面前。那没有知觉的贵重金属似乎闪着她的欢快和热情。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present.She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm.The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它是不是很漂亮，吉姆？我寻遍了全城才找到它。现在你一天可以看上一百次时间了。把你的表给我。我想看看配上表怎么样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Isn’t it a dandy, Jim?I hunted all over town to find it.You’ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now.Give me your watch.I want to see how it looks on it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆没有听命行事，而是躺倒在沙发上，双手放在后脑勺下，微笑着。</td>
		<td class="en">Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“德尔。”他说，“让我们把圣诞礼物收起来保存一阵吧。此刻，它们实在太好了，还不能用。我是卖了表，换钱给你买的梳子。现在，你做肉排吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Dell,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas presents away and keep ’em a while.They’re too nice to use just at present.I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs.And now suppose you put the chops on.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如你所知，麦琪是聪明人——绝世聪明的人——他们给在马槽里出生的婴儿即耶稣带来了礼物。他们发明了赠送圣诞礼物的这玩意儿。因为是聪明人，他们的礼物毫无疑问也是聪明的礼物。万一碰上一样的东西，很可能还享有交换的特权。而这里，我已经笨拙地给你们讲述了一幢公寓里的两个傻孩子的平淡故事。他们极不明智地为彼此牺牲了他们家中最为宝贵的东西。但最后，我们要对当今的聪明人说的是，在所有赠送礼物的人中，这两个人是最聪明的。在所有赠送与接受礼物的人中，像他们这样的人是最聪明的。不管在哪儿，他们都是最聪明的。他们就是圣贤。</td>
		<td class="en">The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger.They invented the art of giving Christmas presents.Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication.And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house.But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest.Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest.Everywhere they are wisest.They are the magi.</td></tr>
