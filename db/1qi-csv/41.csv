"第一章 只有手段，没有目的","CHAPTER I    All Means and No End"
"一","1.0"
"平凡人在平凡的一天醒来，依着心情的好坏而动作或快或慢，他迎接这一天的心理状态用语言表示就是：“上帝啊！又是一天！真遭罪！”","The plain man on a plain day wakes up, slowly or quickly according to his temperament, and greets the day in a mental posture which might be thus expressed in words:"
"你要是问我这个平凡人指谁，我的回答是：每个人，包括你，当然也包括我，包括富人、穷人，成功的人、不成功的人，懒散的人、勤快的人，奢侈的人和吝啬的人。每个人消化能力有限，同时戴两条领带也不现实，考虑到投资存在风险，富人和成功人士都有一定的责任，人们极尽所能地寻求乐趣以及廉价旅行——现今一种平凡人和另一种平凡人之间真正的差距很小。（其实一直以来都挺小的。）","If you ask me whom I mean by the plain man, my reply is that I mean almost every man. I mean you. I certainly mean me. I mean the rich and the poor, the successful and the unsuccessful, the idle and the diligent, the luxurious and the austere. For, what with the limits of digestion, the practical impossibility of wearing two neckties at once, the insecurity of investments, the responsibilities of wealth and of success, the exhaustingness of the search for pleasure, and the cheapness of travel—the real differences between one sort of plain man and another are slight in these times. (And indeed they always were slight.)"
"平凡人吃早餐以前有很多事情要做——都是必须做的事儿。强制性的日程从一下床就开始了：洗漱、剃须、选了衣服比比划划——这些事情根本不算什么。必须做的事儿是锻炼肌肉——全面又科学地锻炼全身的肌肉——参考着教科书和一张大卡片上的图示。在家里等候访客时，他通常会把这张卡片藏起来，因为不愿承认自己在锻炼；平凡人想让你相信，在这个人人都头脑简单的世界，只有他一个人不追赶时髦；他对锻炼感到羞愧，就像羞愧于下决心改正自己一样，如果妻子正巧撞上他锻炼，平凡人会假装自己正在做些平常的事儿，比如在房间里踱步或是检查腰背上的一颗痣。然而他不会放弃锻炼，锻炼对他来说意义重大。放弃锻炼就意味着自己是个懦夫，是个没用的人。教科书里宣称锻炼会成为一天中最愉快的时光之一，所以他也会学会期待锻炼。很快平凡人就学会了期待锻炼，但心情却不怎么愉快。当天的锻炼结束后他会觉得松了口气，也觉得很骄傲。","The plain man has a lot to do before he may have his breakfast—and he must do it. The tyrannic routine begins instantly he is out of bed. To lave limbs, to shave the jaw, to select clothes and assume them—these things are naught. He must exercise his muscles—all his muscles equally and scientifically—with the aid of a text-book and of diagrams on a large card; which card he often hides if he is expecting visitors in his chamber, for he will not always confess to these exercises; he would have you believe that he alone, in a world of simpletons, is above the faddism of the hour; he is as ashamed of these exercises as of a good resolution, and when his wife happens to burst in on them he will pretend to be doing some common act, such as walking across the room or examining a mole in the small of his back. And yet he will not abandon them. They have an empire over him. To drop them would be to be craven, inefficient. The text-book asserts that they will form one of the pleasantest parts of the day, and that he will learn to look forward to them. He soon learns to look forward to them, but not with glee. He is relieved and proud when they are over for the day."
"平凡人早餐时胃口会不错，因为照着图示做动作很累人；若不是因为锻炼，早晨通常的匆忙中他会若有所思。占据平凡人思绪的是一种命中注定的感觉，一种自己已走上指定的轨道不敢偏离的感觉。火车、电车、或是汽车（都是一样的）正在等着他，无法取消，无法拒绝，无法避免。他强制自己离开，径直走向命运，就像是去看牙医。和在家享受早餐一样，要不是那挥之不去的命中注定之感，平凡人也会在车上很享受地读报和抽烟。而工作的念头攫住了他，是什么样的工作无关紧要。工作就是一切，一切都是工作。平凡人到了办公地点——不论他在什么样的地方办公。在自己的办公室里，他必须一头埋进去——他一头埋进去了。现在一天才真正开始。规定好的道路平铺在他面前，他要工作五、六、七或八个小时。","He would enjoy his breakfast, thanks to the strenuous imitation of diagrams, were it not that, in addition to being generally in a hurry, he is preoccupied. He is preoccupied by the sense of doom, by the sense that he has set out on the appointed path and dare not stray from it. The train or the tram-car or the automobile (same thing) is waiting for him, irrevocable, undeniable, inevitable. He wrenches himself away. He goes forth to his fate, as to the dentist. And just as he would enjoy his breakfast in the home, so he would enjoy his newspaper and cigarette in the vehicle, were it not for that ever-present sense of doom. The idea of business grips him. It matters not what the business is. Business is everything, and everything is business. He reaches his office—whatever his office is. He is in his office. He must plunge—he plunges. The day has genuinely begun now. The appointed path stretches straight in front of him, for five, six, seven, eight hours."
"噢！但职业是平凡人自己选择的，他喜欢。职业能满足他的本能，是他的生活。（可以这么说。）那么，平凡人喜欢这职业吗？工作能满足他的本能吗？是他的生活吗？即使这些答案真的是肯定的，至少平凡人自己还没有意识到。他感受不到喜悦。要是自己都不知道自己是快乐的，那快乐有什么用？有些人知道自己在工作时是快乐的，但这类人很少。大部分人是不快乐的，而这些人中的大部分甚至连假装快乐都不会。一般的平凡人对工作的整体态度说明工作是件烦人的事儿，非常烦人。他内心期待上午十点多钟去理发的心情不知道有多满足！招呼那打断他工作的不速之客时不知道有多开心！决定可以把一些任务合理地推到明天时不知道有多轻松！听到街上有乐队或是消防车的声音，他就会像小孩或女店员一样急切地冲到窗边。要是正在玩高尔夫，即使霍亨索伦王室所有的军乐团都出动，他也不会转一下头，哪怕一大批防火的摩天大楼同时着火也不会让他分神。不！我们实话实说吧。工作是规定好的道路上最难接受、最棘手的一部分。要不然，工作是不会被普遍当作达成目的的手段的。","Oh! But he chose his vocation. He likes it. It satisfies his instincts. It is his life. (So you say.) Well, does he like it? Does it satisfy his instincts? Is it his life? If truly the answer is affirmative, he is at any rate not conscious of the fact. He is aware of no ecstasy. What is the use of being happy unless he knows he is happy? Some men know that they are happy in the hours of business, but they are few. The majority are not, and the bulk of the majority do not even pretend to be. The whole attitude of the average plain man to business implies that business is a nuisance, scarcely mitigated. With what secret satisfaction he anticipates that visit to the barber’s in the middle of the morning! With what gusto he hails the arrival of an unexpected interrupting friend! With what easement he decides that he may lawfully put off some task till the morrow! Let him hear a band or a fire-engine in the street, and he will go to the window with the eagerness of a child or of a girl-clerk. If he were working at golf the bands of all the regiments of Hohenzollern1 would not make him turn his head, nor the multitudinous blazing of fireproof skyscrapers. No! Let us be honest. Business constitutes the steepest, roughest league of the appointed path. Were it otherwise, business would not be universally regarded as a means to an end."
"再者，平凡人又回到家，他妻子的表情会像是在这样说吗：“我知道你今天真正的生活已经结束，真为你难过你又要回到这里。我知道你生活中浓厚的兴趣已经没了，但很高兴你充满热情地度过了五、六、七或八个小时的愉快时光”？根本不是！他妻子的表情会像是在说：“我同情你经受的一切，真不幸你不得不这么辛苦操劳。但我会试着补偿你、安慰你、逗你开心。在我的笑脸中忘记焦虑和疲惫吧。”她没有给他拿来舒服的拖鞋，部分原因是因为在当今这个世纪妻子都不做这样的事了，还有部分原因是现在人们不穿舒服的拖鞋了。但她会做等同于拿拖鞋的事——不管在具体家庭中这个等同于拿拖鞋的事是什么。平凡人期待看到妻子脸上的同情和安慰。如果看不到，就会很受伤。","Moreover, when the plain man gets home again, does his wife’s face say to him: “I know that your real life is now over for the day, and I regret for your sake that you have to return here. I know that the powerful interest of your life is gone. But I am glad that you have had five, six, seven, or eight hours of passionate pleasure”? Not a bit! His wife’s face says to him: “I commiserate with you on all that you have been through. It is a great shame that you should be compelled to toil thus painfully. But I will try to make it up to you. I will soothe you. I will humour you. Forget anxiety and fatigue in my smiles.” She does not fetch his comfortable slippers for him, partly because, in this century, wives do not do such things, and partly because comfortable slippers are no longer worn. But she does the equivalent—whatever the equivalent may happen to be in that particular household. And he expects the commiseration and the solace in her face. He would be very hurt did he not find it there."
"即使现在，平凡人也没有放松。现在规定好的道路还是在面前无情地延伸，他不能有丝毫懈怠，因为现在他感觉到的是高度复杂的家庭机器里的齿轮和曲柄。早餐时他拒绝听到这些，这些事被拒之门外；他忙得根本顾不上。到了晚上就逃不掉了。不就是他自己创造了这台机器吗？平凡人经常惊奇地发现，妻子是个独立的存在，很多方面自己都不了解她，而平凡人必须把自己置于他人的存在中，不光有他的妻子，还有其他小人物。比如说，女儿一直在长大，一天也不耽搁。有天晚上回到家，他发觉女儿已经长大成人了，自己则必须像对待女人那样对待她。他可没预料到会是这样。平静、安逸、放松，在一个被种种惊人现象搅得不得安宁的家中，这些可能吗？不可能，做梦去吧！这些现象原本该是他职业生涯中的点缀，却逐渐就要成为他工作的唯一原因。如果说妻子是为他而活，那么他肯定也同样地为妻子而活；至于女儿，虽然她显然不是为父亲而活，他必须得承认自己要为她而活——而且这一点女儿很清楚！","And even yet he is not relaxed. Even yet the appointed path stretches inexorably in front, and he cannot wander. For now he feels the cogs and cranks of the highly complex domestic machine. At breakfast he declined to hear them; they were shut off from him; he was too busy to be bothered with them. At evening he must be bothered with them. Was it not he who created the machine? He discovers, often to his astonishment, that his wife has an existence of her own, full of factors foreign to him, and he has to project himself, not only into his wife’s existence, but into the existences of other minor personages. His daughter, for example, will persist in growing up. Not for a single day will she pause. He arrives one night and perceives that she is a woman and that he must treat her as a woman. He had not bargained for this. Peace, ease, relaxation in a home vibrating to the whir of such astounding phenomena? Impossible dream! These phenomena were originally meant by him to be the ornamentation of his career, but they are threatening to be the sole reason of his career. If his wife lives for him, it is certain that he lives just as much for his wife; and as for his daughter, while she emphatically does not live for him, he is bound to admit that he has just got to live for her—and she knows it!"
"挣钱让人筋疲力尽，花钱也同样让人筋疲力尽。平凡人不能逃脱规定好的道路，也不能摆脱命中注定之感。还没有开始从家里的种种震惊中恢复过来，晚餐已经结束了。然后女儿可能心不在焉地对他说些甜言蜜语，他也可能和妻子懒洋洋地说点闲话，或者像所有小孩子一样和狗一起嬉戏。打个呵欠。另一天的阴影又来了。他不能睡得太晚，否则会影响第二天必需的精力。此外他也不想熬夜，没什么东西让他有兴趣一直不睡。床也是不能逃避的规定道路的一部分。上床后，他的脑子里思绪万千。至于现在的思想状态，往最好了说，也只是他足够明智，希望一切尽可能地好。","To gain money was exhausting; to spend it is precisely as exhausting. He cannot quit the appointed path nor lift the doom. Dinner is finished ere he has begun to recover from the varied shock of home. Then his daughter may negligently throw him a few moments of charming cajolery. He may gossip in simple idleness with his wife. He may gambol like any infant with the dog. A yawn. The shadow of the next day is upon him. He must not stay up too late, lest the vigour demanded by the next day should be impaired. Besides, he does not want to stay up. Naught is quite interesting enough to keep him up. And bed, too, is part of the appointed, unescapable path. To bed he goes, carrying ten million preoccupations. And of his state of mind the kindest that can be said is that he is philosophic enough to hope for the best."
"这一夜过去，他醒来，依着心情的好坏而动作或快或慢，为迎接这天说道：","And after the night he wakes up, slowly or quickly according to his temperament, and greets the day with:"
"“上帝啊！又是一天！真遭罪！”","“Oh, Lord! Another day! What a grind!”"
"二","2.0"
"整个情况中有趣的一点是，平凡人很少或从不自问与规定道路——即他不敢也不能偏离的道路——有关的真正基本的问题。","The interesting point about the whole situation is that the plain man seldom or never asks himself a really fundamental question about that appointed path of his—that path from which he dare not and could not wander."
"一次，也许这只是在某个寓言中，平凡人在旅途中遇到了另一个旅人。平凡人问旅人：","Once, perhaps in a parable, the plain man travelling met another traveller. And the plain man demanded of the traveller:"
"“你要去哪儿？”","“Where are you going to?”"
"旅人回答：","The traveller replied:"
"“我来想想这个问题，我真不知道要去哪儿。”","“Now I come to think of it, I don’t know.”"
"平凡人对这个冷漠的回答有点气恼。他说：","The plain man was ruffled by this insensate answer. He said:"
"“你是在旅行吧？","“But you are travelling?”"
"旅人回答：","The traveller replied:"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"平凡人开始感到恼火了，他说：","The plain man, beginning to be annoyed, said:"
"“你从不问自己要到哪儿去吗？”","“Have you never asked yourself where you are going to?”"
"“没问过。”","“I have not.”"
"“你是想告诉我说，”平凡人有意见了，他现在真的生气了，“你不顾麻烦和危险，花钱坐火车和轮船，却连要去哪儿也不问问自己吗？”","“But do you mean to tell me,” protested the plain man, now irritated, “that you are putting yourself to all this trouble, peril, and expense of trains and steamers, without having asked yourself where you are going to? ”"
"“我从未想过。”旅人承认说，“我只是不得不出发，所以就出发了。”","“It never occurred to me,” the traveller admitted. “I just had to start and I started.”"
"就这样，平凡人，我们这样的平凡人经常会如此，为人性中不合逻辑的荒谬震惊，感觉受到了深深的伤害。“这可能吗？”他想，“这个旅人的神智大概还正常吧——”等等。（你对这种语调和风格很熟悉，因为你自己也是个平凡人。）然后他就任凭自己在道德上义愤了。","Whereupon the plain man was, as too often with us plain men, staggered and deeply affronted by the illogical absurdity of human nature. “Was it conceivable,” he thought, “that this traveller, presumably in his senses—”etc. (You are familiar with the tone and the style, being a plain man yourself.) And he gave way to moral indignation."
"这里必须插一句，我坚定地声明我是“抑制道德义愤协会”的会员。鉴于此，我反对平凡人对旅人的道德义愤；我认为义愤倾向是平凡人最严重的缺点之一。所以，我努力的方向是，避免为人类的古怪行为感到震惊或深深冒犯，甚至都不要惊奇。有太多的平凡人一直在重新认识人性——人性的卑鄙、昏庸和不理性。他们生活在人性中，就像是生活在鬼屋里。然而，这么多年过去，我们当然应该已经习惯人性！人性可能极端卑鄙——但这不是问题的关键，关键是它构成了我们生活的环境，只要活着就无法逃避的环境。一个人要是能被他不可逃避的生存环境所深深冒犯，就应该有勇气为自己定罪，然后一枪打死自己。协会将很乐意支付他的葬礼费用，并帮忙供养他的遗孀和孩子。这样的人自己不知道，他们构成了真正进步的死敌，真正的进步只有在没有狂热的道德优越感的环境下才能得以计划和实施。","Now I must here, in parenthesis, firmly state that I happen to be a member of the Society for the Suppression of Moral Indignation. As such, I object to the plain man’s moral indignation against the traveller; and I think that a liability to moral indignation is one of the plain man’s most serious defects. As such, my endeavour is to avoid being staggered and deeply affronted, or even surprised, by human vagaries. There are too many plain people who are always rediscovering human nature—its turpitudes, fatuities, unreason. They live amid human nature as in a chamber of horrors. And yet, after all these years, we surely ought to have grown used to human nature! It may be extremely vile—that is not the point. The point is that it constitutes our environment, from which we cannot escape alive. The man who is capable of being deeply affronted by his inevitable environment ought to have the pluck of his convictions and shoot himself. The Society would with pleasure pay his funeral expenses and contribute to the support of his wife and children. Such a man is, without knowing it, a dire enemy of true progress, which can only be planned and executed in an atmosphere from which heated moral superiority is absent."
"我在这里加上评论是为了保证，在平凡人和旅人后续的谈话中，我不会义愤填膺地对平凡人的话嗤之以鼻。因为这段谈话的确还有后续。","I offer these parenthetical remarks as a guarantee that I shall not over-righteously sneer at the plain man for his share in the sequel to the conversation with the traveller. For there was a sequel to the conversation."
"“既然说起了这个问题，那么你要去哪儿呢？”旅人说。","“As questions are being asked, where are you going to?” said the traveller."
"平凡人肯定地答复：","The plain man answered with assurance:"
"“我很肯定地知道要去哪儿。我要去提姆巴克图。”“是吗！”旅人说。“你为什么要去提姆巴克图呢？”平凡人说：“因为那是个合适的地方。每个自重的人都去提姆巴克图。”","“Oh, I know exactly where I’m going to. I’m going to Timbuctoo.” “Indeed!” said the traveller. “And why are you going to Timbuctoo?” Said the plain man: “I’m going because it’s the proper place to go to. Every self-respecting person goes to Timbuctoo.”"
"“为什么呢？”","“But why?”"
"平凡人说：","Said the plain man:"
"“这个，据说它几乎是独一无二的。在那儿你会觉得满足，能得到一直想要的东西，气候也很好。”“是吗！”旅人又说，“你遇见过去过那儿的人吗？”","“Well, it’s supposed to be just about unique. You’re contented there. You get what you’ve always wanted. The climate’s wonderful.” “Indeed!” said the traveller again. “Have you met anybody who’s been there?”"
"“是的，遇见过好几个，可不少呢。我还收到过在那儿的人写来的信呢。”","“Yes, I’ve met several. I’ve met a lot. And I’ve heard from people who are there.”"
"“他们的讲述热情吗？”","“And are their reports enthusiastic?”"
"“这个嘛——”平凡人犹豫了。","“Well—” The plain man hesitated."
"“回答我，他们的讲述热情吗？”旅人坚持问，相当霸道。","“Answer me. Are their reports enthusiastic?” the traveller insisted, rather bullyingly."
"“不是很热情，”平凡人承认，“有人说那里很让人失望，有人说和其他城镇差不多，大家都说那里的气候有严重的缺陷。”","“Not very,” the plain man admitted. “Some say it’s very disappointing. And some say it’s much like other towns. Every one says the climate has grave drawbacks.”"
"旅人问：","The traveller demanded:"
"“那你为什么还要去？“","“Then why are you going there?”"
"平凡人说：","Said the plain man:"
"“我从没想过为什么。像我所说的那样，据说提姆巴克图是——”","“It never occurred to me to ask why. As I say, Timbuctoo’s supposed to be—”"
"“据谁说？”","“Supposed by whom?”"
"“这个嘛——大家都这么说，”平凡人无力地说。","“Well—generally supposed,” said the plain man, limply."
"“不是据去过那里的人说吗？”旅人固执地坚持问道。"," “Not by the people who’ve been there?” the traveller persevered, with obstinacy."
"“也许不是，”平凡人吸了口气说道。","“Perhaps not,” breathed the plain man."
"“但大家都这么——”他结巴了。","“But it’s generally supposed—” He faltered."
"没人说话，旅人打破沉默，问“路上有什么有趣的地方吗？”","There was a silence, which was broken by the traveller, who inquired: “Any interesting places en route?”"
"“我不知道，我从不在意这些，”平凡人说。“你是想告诉我说，”旅人惊呼道，“你不顾麻烦和危险，花钱坐火车、轮船，骑骆驼，却也不问问自己为什么，也没有说服自己这件事是值得的，甚至都没有弄清最适合的路线吗？”","“I don’t know. I never troubled about that,” said the plain man. “But do you mean to tell me,” the traveller exclaimed, “that you are putting yourself to all this trouble, peril, and expense of trains and steamers and camel-back without having asked yourself why, and without having satisfied yourself that the thing was worth while, and without having even ascertained the most agreeable route?”"
"平凡人软弱地说：","Said the plain man, weakly:"
"“我只是需要出发去某个地方，所以我出发去提姆巴克图。”旅人说：","“I just had to start for somewhere, so I started for Timbuctoo.” Said the traveller:"
"“好吧，我现在不想计较了，握手言和吧。”","“Well, I’m of a forgiving disposition. Shake hands.”"
"三","3.0"
"上面寓言中这两个人互相追问基本问题来折磨对方，而这个寓言的不真实之处在于现实中没有人会这样做。举例来说，平凡人现在几乎不再应对基本问题，原因也就不难弄清。原因在于按照现代人的想法，基本问题变得很难回答。以前每一个基本问题都有一个现成的答案。你问了一个问题，但在提问之前就已经知道了答案，所以就不会产生争论，也几乎不会产生焦虑。在以前那个时代，一个小孩子只需要看一眼你的行为，就能很肯定地告诉你，如果坚持这么做，那么一万年后你会在干什么，感觉会如何。但自那之后人类知识取得了进步，所增加知识的不利之处在于它强化了无知的感觉，结果就是，尽管我们比祖父辈的人知道的要多得多，但无知的感觉却也比他们强烈得多。实际上他们因为太无知而意识不到自己的无知——这也许是一种舒服的状态。所以现今的平凡人逃避基本问题。当然了，“抑制道德义愤协会”的会员也不能指责他。","The two individuals in the foregoing parable were worrying each other with fundamental questions. And what makes the parable unrealistic the plain man, for instance, has almost ceased to deal in fundamental questions in these days, the reason is not difficult to find. The reason lies in the modern perception that fundamental questions are getting very hard to answer. In a former time a dogmatic answer was ready waiting for every fundamental question. You asked the question, but before you asked it you knew the answer, and so there was no argument and nearly no anxiety. In that former time a mere child could glance at your conduct and tell you with certainty exactly what you would be doing and how you would be feeling ten thousand years hence, if you persisted in the said conduct. But knowledge has advanced since then, and the inconvenience of increased knowledge is that it intensifies the sense of ignorance, with the result that, though we know immensely more than our grandfathers knew, we feel immensely more ignorant than they ever felt. They were, indeed, too ignorant to be aware of ignorance—which is perhaps a comfortable state. Thus the plain man nowadays shirks fundamental questions. And assuredly no member of the Society for the Suppression of Moral Indignation shall blame him."
"所有的基本问题最后都会归结为以下关于生活的看法和疑问：“我现在做的事情相当无聊，忍受下去能有什么好处呢？”这是基本问题。它还有一些重要性不一的形式。在终极的形式中，还要用到“永恒”这个词。平凡人如今对这个问题的终极形式如此敏感，别说提出或试着回答这个问题，他甚至不能忍受听到别人讨论它——我指的是坦白的讨论。现实中关于这个问题开诚布公地讨论，会诱使平凡人表现出异常的狂热和刻薄，从而掩盖智慧的光辉。所以他宁愿承担放弃这个问题的不利后果，而不是面对试图解决它带来的不满。放弃这个问题的不利后果很明显。生存是而且必须是对当下的要求和对未来要求的折衷——而如果一个人对于未来都没规划好，那么这个折衷怎样才能达成呢？根本不能达成。但是——我要重申——我不会责备平凡人。我只会向他暗示，而且是在照顾到他的敏感的基础上，现在的一个钟头和一万年后的一个钟头一样，都是永恒的一部分。","All fundamental questions resolve themselves finally into the following assertion and inquiry about life: “I am now engaged in something rather tiresome. What do I stand to gain by it later on?” That is the basic query. It has forms of varying importance. In its supreme form the word “eternity” has to be employed. And the plain man is, today, so sensitive about this supreme form of the question that, far from asking and trying to answer it, he can scarcely bear to hear it even discussed—I mean discussed with candour. In practice a frank discussion of it usually tempts him to exhibitions of extraordinary heat and bitterness, and wisdom is thereby but obscured. Therefore he prefers the disadvantage of leaving it alone to the dissatisfaction of attempting to deal with it. The disadvantage of leaving it alone is obvious. Existence is, and must be, a compromise between the claims of the moment and the claims of the future—and how can that compromise be wisely established if one has not somehow made up one’s mind about the future? It cannot. But—I repeat—I would not blame the plain man. I would only just hint to him, while respecting his sensitiveness, that the present hour is just as much a part of eternity as another hour ten thousand years off."
"根本问题的第二个形式——也是最重要的形式——围绕着晚年这个问题。被质询时，所有的平凡人都会承认他们有种想法，自己在向某个类似于提姆巴克图的目标进发，而这个目标应在自己的晚年实现。这个目标可能是实现某个抱负，或是奢华的生活，或是物质的保障，或是健康的身体，或是知识，或是权力，甚至可能是问心无愧。无论如何这个目标是具体而且可辨识的。而通向它的道路也是一条笔直宽广的大道，可以清楚地看到前面很长一段路途。","The second—the most important—form of the fundamental question embraces the problem of old age. All plain men will admit, when faithfully cross-examined, a sort of belief that they are on their way to some Timbuctoo situate in the region of old age. It may be the Timbuctoo of a special ambition realized, or the Timbuctoo of luxury, or the Timbuctoo of material security, or the Timbuctoo of hale health, or the Timbuctoo of knowledge, or the Timbuctoo of power, or even the Timbuctoo of a good conscience. It is anyhow a recognizable and definable Timbuctoo. And the path leading to it is a straight, wide thoroughfare, clearly visible for a long distance ahead."
"关于凡人人生旅途的道理简单且很少有人质疑。这个道理是具有两面性的——首先，成就带来的喜悦可以补偿路途上的艰辛和自我否定；其次，一事无成的痛苦超过了及时行乐的乐趣。因为人性的某些神秘特质，这个道理是不可颠覆的，否则的话仅仅把以往的失败经验累积起来，也早就能驳倒这个道理了。因为世界上这种老人多的是：实现了抱负的、享受荣华富贵的、地位像勃朗峰一样坚不可摧的、身体像骆驼一样健康的、有史以来知识最丰富的、点下头就能摧毁一千英里铁路的，还有心地像白雪一样纯洁的；但与此同时却一点都不快乐、不能享受生活的。","The theory of the mortal journey is simple and seldom challenged. It is a twofold theory—first that the delight of achievement will compensate for the rigours and self-denials of the route, and second that the misery of non-achievement would outweigh the immediate pleasures of dallying. If this theory were not indestructible, for reasons connected with the secret nature of humanity, it would probably have been destroyed long ago by the mere cumulative battering of experience. For the earth’s surface is everywhere thickly dotted with old men who have achieved ambition, old men drenched in luxury, old men as safe as Mont Blanc from overthrow, old men with the health of camels, old men who know more than anybody ever knew before, old men whose nod can ruin a thousand miles of railroad, and old men with consciences of pure snow; but who are not happy and cannot enjoy life."
"而这个道理碰巧是不可颠覆的，部分原因在于晚年还早得很，部分在于年轻人诚恳地相信只有自己才有智慧，部分在于每个平凡人都确信自己的人生和别人有所不同，但主要原因在于：努力，是一种习惯，这里并非特指某种努力，而是指任何努力，这习惯出于平凡人根深蒂固的本能。所以提姆巴克图作为度假胜地的美名一点儿都没有受到损害，人们怀着诚挚的热忱源源不断地继续朝圣之旅。","The theory, however, does happen to be indestructible, partly because old age is such a terrible long way off, partly because the young honestly believe themselves to have a monopoly of wisdom, partly because every plain man is convinced that his case will be different from all the other cases, and chiefly because endeavour—not any particular endeavour, but rather any endeavour!—is a habit that corresponds to a very profound instinct in the plain man. So the reputation of Timbuctoo as a pleasure resort remains entirely unimpaired, and the pilgrimages continue with unabated earnestness."
"这个朝圣之旅之所以要继续，还有另一个极其重要的原因。寓言里的两个人都说他们必须要出发——说得没错。我们必须出发，而且一旦出发就要坚持走下去，并且到达某个地方。而我们出发的时候，既无脑力也无闲暇去创造全新的地方作为目的地，也无法开拓新的道路。人人都去提姆巴克图，路线已经标识得清清楚楚。平凡人害怕与众不同，也踏上了提姆巴克图之旅，一路紧随路标。怕不能到达，他一路疾驰；因对未知感到恐惧，他一直走在路当中，不敢涉足路边的森林；是希望给了他继续前行的勇气。","And there is another and a paramount reason why the pilgrimages should continue. The two men in the parable both said that they just had to start—and they were right. We have to start, and, once started, we have to keep going. We must go somewhere. And at the moment of starting we have neither the sagacity nor the leisure to invent fresh places to start for, or to cut new paths. Everybody is going to Timbuctoo; the roads are well marked. And the plain man, with his horror of being peculiar, sets out for Timbuctoo also, following the signposts. The fear of not arriving keeps him on the trot, the fear of the unknown keeps him in the middle of the road and out of the forest on either side of it, and hope keeps up his courage."
"会有“抑制道德义愤协会”的会员上前激烈地指责平凡人吗？怪他愚蠢、无知、好骗，甚至指责他懦弱到没去找一个令人信服的答案，来回答关于人生终点这样的基本问题？","Will any member of the Society for the Suppression of Moral Indignation step forward and heatedly charge the plain man with culpable foolishness, ignorance, or gullibility; or even with cowardice in neglecting to find a convincing answer to the fundamental question about the other end of his life?"

"这个基本问题还有第三种形式，没有以上两种那么难以回答。只要“以后”指的是死后或30年后，平凡人对于现在的劳累困苦能为“以后”带来什么便漠不关心，这是可以原谅的。但我们同时也生活在当下，如果正确的生存是对当下要求和未来要求的折衷，那么就必须同样考虑当下。这样的话平凡人再自问基本问题，就要采取这样的形式：“现在，也就是今天上午，我在做相当无聊的事，这样忍下去的话，今晚、明天或这周、下周，我能得到什么？”一旦以此形式提问，基本问题的答案就能立刻从经验或试验中找到。","There is, however, a third form of the fundamental question which is less unanswerable than the two forms already mentioned. The plain man maybe excused for his remarkable indifference as to what his labour and his tedium will gain for him “later on,” when “later on” means beyond the grave or thirty years hence. But we live also in the present, and if proper existence is a compromise between the claims of the present and the claims of the future the present must be considered, and the plain man ought surely to ask himself the fundamental question in such a form as the following: “I am now—this morning—engaged in something rather tiresome. What do I stand to gain by it this evening, tomorrow, this week—next week?” In this form the fundamental question, once put, can be immediately answered by experience and by experiment."
"但平凡人会这么问吗？我是说，他会认真、有效地对待这个问题吗？我想除了偶尔例外，通常情况下，他不会。他也许会，事实上也真的会，沮丧又粗鲁地嘟囔：“我这生活有什么乐趣？”但不会坚持自己找出答案，即使得到了明确的答案——即使他坦白承认，“得不到乐趣，”或者“乐趣不够”——他还是不太可能根据这答案来改变自己的生活。在去提姆巴克图的途中，他一如既往地无视路边所有可爱的小镇和绿洲。对于未来的乐趣极不确定，而忙得透不过来气的他就更无暇去思考当下的乐趣，于是只好固执地前行，就像陷入昏迷的人一样。一个平凡人以头脑清醒为荣，这是多么不同寻常的行为啊！","But does the plain man put it? I mean—does he put it seriously and effectively? I think that very often, if not as a general rule, he does not. He may—in fact he does—gloomily and savagely mutter: “What pleasure do I get out of life?” But he fails to insist on a clear answer from himself, and even if he obtains a clear answer—even if he makes the candid admission, “No pleasure,” or “Not enough pleasure”—even then he usually does not insist on modifying his life in accordance withthe answer. He goes on ignoring all the interesting towns and oases on the way to his Timbuctoo. Excessively uncertain about future joy, and too breathlessly preoccupied to think about joy in the present, he just drives obstinately ahead, rather like a person in a trance. Singular conduct for a plain man priding himself on common sense!"
"对能干又尽职尽责的平凡人，我们通常只能这样总结：面对生存这一问题，即同时保证现在尽可能满足与未来尽可能安定的问题，平凡人进行了全面的自我教育，也专门学习了某个职业或行当。选择这一职业或行当也就选择了其附带的所有风险和责任——这些风险和责任往往涉及他人的幸福。他将自己的一生交付于这一职业或行当，几乎不能反悔；每天花很多小时做这份工作，花更多的时间来琢磨它。而且为了寻求满足，他娶了个女人作妻子，然后有了孩子。这里最好坦白指出，他娶妻的首要目的不是为了让这女人幸福，而是让自己幸福，孩子的到来也并非因为孩子们会快活，而是因为他们是父亲个体的延续。家庭，这个为了次要个体而逐渐建立起来的环境，构成了另一套复杂的体系；他把这个体系强加在自己的职业或行当这一复杂体系上，结果脑子就必须同时担负起这两个体系，让它们好好运作。他所有的精力都被耗尽，而且耗得一干二净，每年都不得不度一次假，以防崩溃。可连假期这个体系也是复杂且令人疲惫的。","For the case of the plain man, conscientious and able, can only too frequently be summed up thus: faced with the problem of existence, which is the problem of combining the largest possible amount of present satisfaction with the largest possible amount of security in the future, he has educated himself generally, and he has educated himself specially for a particular profession or trade; he has adopted the profession or trade, with all its risks and responsibilities—risks and responsibilities which often involve the felicity of others; he has bound himself to it for life, almost irrevocably; he labours for it so many hours a day, and it occupies his thoughts for so many hours more. Further, in the quest of satisfaction, he has taken a woman to wife and has had children. And here it is well to note frankly that his prime object in marrying was not the woman’s happiness, but his own, and that the children came, not in order that they might be jolly little creatures, but as extensions of the father’s individuality. The home, the environment gradually constructed for these secondary beings, constitutes another complex organization, which he superimposes on the complex organization of his profession or trade, and his brain has to carry and vitalize the two of them. All his energies are absorbed, and they are absorbed so utterly that once a year he is obliged to take a holiday lest he should break down, and even the organization of the holiday is complex and exhausting."
"现在假设，这可是个大胆的假设，他所做的这一切都是为了未来的保障，那么这个沉重的体系能让现在有什么可感知的、直接的个人满足呢？我承认它能产生维持生活所带来的原始满足感。但是住着茅屋的霍屯督人不这么费劲也能同样维持生活。我也承认理论上它应该让人产生能意识得到的满足感，就是那种任何持续的努力后都会产生的满足感。但我不承认事实上它真能带来这种满足感，因为人们忙碌得没有时间审视自己灵魂的财富。那它还能产生什么？这项吃力的苦劳还能有什么其他的直接效果？","Now assuming—a tremendous assumption!—that by all this he really is providing security for the future, what conscious direct, personal satisfaction in the present does the onerous programme actually yield? I admit that it yields the primitive satisfaction of keeping body and soul together. But a Hottentot2 in a kraal gets the same satisfaction at less expense. I admit also that it ought theoretically to yield the conscious satisfaction which accompanies any sustained effort of the faculties. I deny that in fact it does yield this satisfaction, for the reason that the man is too busy ever to examine the treasures of his soul. And what else does it yield? For what other immediate end is the colossal travail being accomplished?"
"的确，平凡人会练习身体或思想上的柔软体操、经营一项巨大的事业、派出人员和轮船到世界各地、有一个环境优美的家、每天穿梭于办公室和家之间、夜里失眠、视力和消化能力慢慢退化、赔上健康、为了珍爱的人情愿冒痛苦的风险、让保险公司发财、带着从未见过的美丽姑娘去兜风——而他眼下能从这一切中得到的全部好处就是：可以每两周心无旁骛地打一次高尔夫；或是大约一周左右和妻子享受一次半小时的亲密时间，脑子里什么都不想；或是和女儿吵上十分钟的架，偶尔晚上能歇歇脑子！更有甚者，也许在连续操劳四十年后，当被问起真正感受到的乐趣是什么时，他唯一的答案就是：“我有时间就会去遛狗，我喜欢和狗一起玩儿。”","Well, it may, and does, occur that the plain man is practising physical and intellectual calisthenics, and running a vast business and sending ships and men to the horizons of the earth, and keeping a home in a park, and oscillating like a rapid shuttle daily between office and home, and lying awake at nights, and losing his eyesight and his digestion, and staking his health, and risking misery for the beings whom he cherishes, and enriching insurance companies, and providing joy-rides for nice young women whom he has never seen—and all his present profit therefrom is a game of golf with a free mind once a fortnight, or half an hour’s intimacy with his wife and a free mind once a week or so, or a ten minutes’ duel with that daughter of his and a free mind on an occasional evening! Nay, it may occur that after forty years of incessant labour, in answer to an inquiry as to where the genuine conscious fun comes in, he has the right only to answer: “Well, when I have time, I take the dog out for a walk. I enjoy larking with the dog.”"
"这位可敬的平凡人，因为害怕自我反省，往往只记得手段而忘记当下的目的。如此一来，当第一个较长期的目标——也就是有保障的晚年——快要达到时，他也无法承认这个目标已经完成，反而会仅仅出于习惯而继续为手段不停担忧！当他终于承认期盼的目标已经达到并丢弃了手段后，却因为缺乏准备而完全不能享受成果，光这个变化就够他受的！平凡人的墓志铭应该这样写：“这里长眠着一位头脑清醒的平凡人，他的人生里只有手段，没有目的。”","The estimable plain man, with his horror of self-examination, is apt to forget the immediate end of existence in the means. And so much so, that when the first distant end—that of a secure old age—approaches achievement, he is incapable of admitting it to be achieved, and goes on worrying and worrying about the means—from simple habit! And when he does admit the achievement of the desired end, and abandons the means, he has so badly prepared himself to relish the desired end that the mere change kills him! His epitaph ought to read: “Here lies the plain man of common sense, whose life was all means and no end.”"
"应该想个对策解决这个问题。","A remedy will be worth finding."

"第二章 快乐的滋味","CHAPTER II The Taste for Pleasure"
"一","1.0"
"一天晚上——这种事注定会发生在晚上——我上一章仔细剖析的平凡人会突然爆发。这座外表平静理智而内里一直沸腾的火山会突然喷发，大量岩浆一样的隐忍怨气会覆盖临近的一切。这天的工作碰巧是罕见地不顺，他接连不断地烦心、发火和失望——但最后都理智冷静地应付了过去；疲惫让他不堪重负，但他没有倒下；在这一天辛苦的办公室生活里，他都自我控制得很好，堪称稚拙人士的楷模。但某件完全无关紧要的小事——比如因工作而无法参加一场高尔夫四人赛——一件琐碎的鸡毛蒜皮的事儿让他爆发了，这在旁人看来完全是小题大做，他却无比悲观，刻薄疯狂地叫嚣道：","One evening—it is bound to happen in the evening when it does happen—the plain man whose case I endeavoured to analyse in the previous chapter will suddenly explode. The smouldering volcano within that placid and wise exterior will burst forth, and the surrounding country will be covered with the hot lava of his immense hidden grievance. The business day has perhaps been marked by an unusual succession of annoyances, exasperations, disappointments—but he has met them with fine philosophic calm; fatigue has over taken him—but it has not overcome him; throughout the long ordeal at the office he has remained master of himself, a wondrous example to the young and the foolish. And then some entirely unimportant occurrence—say, an invitation to a golf foursome which his duties forbid him to accept—a trifle, a nothing, comes along and brings about the explosion, in a fashion excessively disconcerting to the onlooker, and he exclaims, acidly, savagely, with a profound pessimism :"
"“我的生活有什么乐趣？”","“What pleasure do I get out of life?”"
"在这个突兀的问题（只有一个答案的问题）面前，他生活的主要缺陷暴露无遗。","And in that single abrupt question (to which there is only one answer) he lays bare the central flaw of his existence."
"这位旁观者很可能是他的妻子，而平凡人说话的语气好像在暗示，对于自己的生活并非一连串妙趣横生的娱乐这一事实，妻子也要无端地负说不清、道不明的责任。他无法和妻子保持一致。除此以外，如果平凡人真的爱妻子，就会时不时地伤害她一下，故意对她不公平，以从中得到某种奇怪的满足感，而他绝不会这么伤害或者不公平地对待一位普通朋友。（这就是爱与喜欢之间的奇妙差别之一！）她吓了一跳，心里很是惊骇，这是意料之中的。他自己也暗中惊骇，因为坦白了一个会带来不便的事实；盎格鲁—撒克逊人也这样惧怕带来不便的事实，所以喜欢直接无视它们。假装事情不是现实那样，在盎格鲁—撒克逊人看来就代表有意志力与健康的人格；而承认事实则会被认为是懦弱或愤世嫉俗。平凡人可不敢愤世嫉俗，所以他会觉得自己是个懦夫，这件事当然让他很生气。","The onlooker will probably be his wife, and the tone employed will probably imply that she is somehow mysteriously to blame for the fact that his earthly days are not one unbroken series of joyous diversions. He has no pose to keep up with his wife. And, moreover, if he really loves her he will find a certain curious satisfaction in hurting her now and then, in being willfully unjust to her, as he would never hurt or be unjust to a mere friend. (Herein is one of the mysterious differences between love and affection!) She is alarmed and secretly aghast, as well she may be. He also is secretly aghast. For he has confessed afact which is an inconvenient fact; and Anglo-Saxons have such a horror of inconvenient facts that they prefer to ignore them even to themselves. To pretend that things are not what they are is regarded by Anglo-Saxons as a proof of strength of mind and wholesomeness of disposition; while to admit that things are indeed what they are is deemed to be either weakness or cynicism. The plain man is incapable of being a cynic; he feels, therefore, that he has been guilty of weakness, and this, of course, makes him very cross."
"“不能做点儿什么吗？”妻子说，她的意思是：“就不能想办法让你的重担减轻些吗？”","“Can’t something be done?” says his wife, meaning, “Can’t something be done to ameliorate your hard lot?”"
"（被误导的人儿！你用错词了。不管用什么措辞都是错的。她应该爱抚他，因为爱抚不需要回答。）","(Misguided creature! It was the wrong phrase to use. And any phrase would have been the wrong phrase. She ought to have caressed him, for to a caress there is no answer.)"
"“你很清楚一点儿办法都没有！”他对妻子厉喝道，就像猛虎扑向小鹿一般。同时挑衅地望着她，像是在说：“我能无视工作吗？我能逃避责任吗？如果我逃避了，你怎么办？孩子们怎么办？要怎么面对晚年、疾病和死亡？账单、花销、税金，还有你的新帽子呢？我要为不测风云、为今后而工作。我算比较成功的；要说清楚的是，成功就意味着我要牺牲当下的快乐。你们这些人倒是可以快乐，但我——”然后他就像一位受到冒犯的烈士一样，讽刺地大声宣布：“能做的都做了！”","“You know perfectly well that nothing can be done!” he snaps her up, like a tiger snapping at the fawn. And his eyes, challenging hers, seem to say: “Can I neglect my business? Can I shirk my responsibilities? Where would you be if I shirked them? Where would the children be? What about old age, sickness, death, quarter-day1, rates, taxes, and your new hat? I have to provide for the rainy day and for the future. I am succeeding, moderately; but let there be no mistake—success means that I must sacrifice present pleasure. Pleasure is all very well for you others, but I—” And then he will finish aloud, with the air of an offended and sarcastic martyr: “Something be done, indeed!”"
"她叹口气。家里这一幕算是结束了。","She sighs. The domestic scene is over."
"现在平凡人已经确信无路可退，我们可以这样认定。但显然觉得无路可退会让他的自尊心得到满足。如果不这么想，就意味着他要承认自己还有没做到的地方，没安排好自己的生活，甚至是对职业规划有了巨大的错误估计。他承认自己很不满意。为了尊严和名声，确定这种不满意是不可避免的才对自己有好处，这件事要怪就怪整个世道的布置不周，而怪不到他个人的规划上。平凡人要扮演的是一名勇敢、坚强而又有耐心的受害者，受制于所谓的自然规律，这个规律规定，为了未来必须牺牲现在，他在这个角色中找到了一种独特的乐趣,而这种乐趣中又充满了痛苦。“痛苦”这词用在这里一点都不错。","Now, he may be honestly convinced that nothing can be done. Let us grant as much. But obviously it suits his pride to assume that nothing can be done. To admit the contrary would be to admit that he was leaving something undone, that he had organized his existence clumsily, even that he had made a fundamental miscalculation in the arrangement of his career. He has confessed to grave dissatisfaction. It behoves him, for the sake of his own dignity and reputation, to be quite sure that the grave dissatisfaction is unavoidable, inevitable, and that the blame for it rests with the scheme of the universe, and not with his particular private scheme. His role is that of the brave, strong, patient victim of an alleged natural law, by reason of which the present must ever be sacrificed to the future, and he discovers a peculiar miserable delight in the role. “Miserable” is the right adjective."
"二","2.0"
"然而作为一位明智的平凡人，他无论如何都不会同意有什么人为的问题是不能借助聪明才智解决的，不管这问题有多么严重和无望——只要这是他人的问题！他解决朋友的问题非常在行，在行得可怕。而且朋友们都意识到了这一点，都来向他征求意见。如果一位朋友过来咨询他：","Nevertheless, in his quality of a wise plain man, he would never agree that any problem of human conduct, however hard and apparently hopeless, could not be solved by dint of sagacity and ingenuity—provided it was the problem of another person! He is quite fearfully good at solving the problems of his friends. Indeed, his friends, recognizing this, constantly go to him for advice. If a friend consulted him and said:"
"“看，我现在赖以维生和养家的这项工作要耗去我三年的全部精力，但我的脑子得不到片刻的歇息。也许能有点儿空闲时间，但脑子歇不下来，要空闲干嘛呢？至于乐趣，我直接忘了就行了。生活会变成长久的挣扎。而且最后的报偿也很不确定，也许会非常不错，但话说回来，也可能什么都没有。”","“Look here, I’m engaged in an enterprise which will absorb all my energies for three years. It will enable me in the meantime to live and to keep my family, but I shall have scarcely a moment’s freedom of mind. I may have a little leisure, but of what use is leisure without freedom of mind? As for pleasure, I shall simply forget what it is. My life will be one long struggle. The ultimate profit is extremely uncertain. It may be fairly good; on the other hand, it may be nothing at all.”"
"直言不讳的平凡人会自信地打断他说：","The plain man, being also blunt, would assuredly interrupt:"
"“亲爱的朋友，你真傻！”然而这个事例本质上和明智的平凡人的事例一样。主要的区别就是明智的平凡人把自己困了三十年，而不是三年，而且还不一定能得到回报！他不属于那种对事业很有热情的极少数人，他仅仅是个普通的平凡人，每天都在做着与天性格格不入的事情，每天都扼杀一部分天性，就是因为心里觉得以后会有报偿。换句话说，他在为生活做准备，好让将来某一天自己能够真正地生活。他还没有做好现在和将来的折衷，那句抱怨“我的生活有什么乐趣？”，证明了他正为了将来而完全牺牲现在。而将来是多么不可捉摸啊！将来就像地平线，一直不停后退。如果在平凡人三十岁的时候，有人预言他到了四十五岁时，会有琴瑟和谐的妻子和孩子，收入还会不断增长，但离幸福还是一样的遥远，他会对这个预言一笑置之。","“My dear fellow, what a fool you’ve been!” Yet this case is in essence the case of the wise plain man. The chief difference between the two cases is that the wise plain man has enslaved himself for about thirty years instead of three, with naught but a sheer gambling chance of final reward! Not being one of the rare individuals with whom business is a passion, but just an average plain man, he is labouring daily against the grain, stultifying daily one part of his nature, on the supposition that later he will be recompensed. In other words, he is preparing to live, so that at a distant date he may be in a condition to live. He has not effected a compromise between the present and the future. His own complaint—“What pleasure do I get out of life?”—proves that he is completely sacrificing the present to the future. And how elusive is the future! Like the horizon, it always recedes. If, when he was thirty, someone had foretold that at forty-five, with a sympathetic wife and family and an increasing income, he would be as far off happiness as ever, he would have smiled at the prophecy."
"这位来询问意见的朋友有点不满平凡人的直率，也许会反驳：","The consulting friend, somewhat nettled by the plain man’s bluntness, might retort:"
"“就算我是个傻瓜吧，但这不是关键。关键是我现在已经开始做这个工作了，已经无路可退。没什么办法了。”","“I may or may not have been a fool. That’s not the point. The point is that I am definitely in the enterprise, and can’t get out of it. And there’s nothing to be done.”"
"这时平凡人会用热情、鼓励又理智的语调回答：","Whereupon the plain man, in an encouraging, enheartening, reasonable tone, would respond:"
"“别这么说，伙计。当然，开始就开始了吧，不过你要告诉我所有的细节，我们来好好考虑考虑这事儿。告诉你，所有看起来很糟的事情实际上都没那么糟。”","“Don’t say that, my dear chap. Of course, if you’re in it, you’re in it. But give me all the details. Let’s examine the thing. And allow me to tell you that no case that looks bad is as bad as it looks.”"
"在处理自己的事情时，平凡人也该用这种态度与情绪。他应该用对朋友的这种理智语气同自己交谈，用这种令人感动的语气，对自己说：“我来好好考虑考虑这事儿。”","It is precisely in this spirit that the plain man should approach his own case. He should say to himself in that reasonable tone which he employs to his friend, and which is so impressive: “Let me examine the thing.”"
"如果平凡人现在正在读这本书，并且正在不情愿地将自己对号入座，那么他会生气地抗议说：","And now the plain man who is reading this and unwillingly fitting the cap will irately protest:"
"“你以为我没有好好考虑过自己的事情吗？你以为我自己不明白吗？我完全明白。我要是不明白还有谁能明白？我告诉您，我完全明白它的一切。”","“Do you suppose I haven’t examined my own case? Do you suppose I don’t understand it? I understand it thoroughly. Who should understand it if I don’t? I beg to inform you that I know absolutely all about it.”"
"不过更有可能的是，平凡人没有好好考虑过自己的事儿。他很可能只是夜里躺在床上，一边觉得自己极其不幸，一边为自己的坚韧感到自豪；这个过程可不能算作考虑，顶多算是自我放任。至于完全了解这一点，他可能都没注意到自己正在慢慢养成自我怜悯和以坚韧为傲的习惯，而且这已经成为他唯一的乐趣——这是个病态的习惯，也是种病态的乐趣！他完全没有意识到自己变得越来越易怒，别人都在他背后议论；也没觉得自己的有害情绪影响了家庭的气氛。","Still the strong probability is that he has not examined it. The strong probability is that he has just lain awake of a night and felt extremely sorry for himself, and at the same time rather proud of his fortitude. Which process does not amount to an examination; it amounts merely to an indulgence. As for knowing absolutely all about it, he has not even noticed that the habit of feeling sorry for himself and proud of his fortitude is slowly growing on him, and tending to become his sole form of joy—a morbid habit and a sickly joy! He is sublimely unaware of that increasing irritability which others discuss behind his back. He has no suspicion that he is balefully affecting the general atmosphere of his home."
"最重要的是平凡人不知道自己正在失去快乐的能力。的确，如果有人提醒说他正在经历这样的变化，平凡人会感到恼怒和沮丧。他会大叫：“你没搞错吧！只要我有机会，一定能像任何人一样让自己开心！”然而有那么多平凡和（所谓的）成功人士吃惊地发现，当雄心得到满足，每天不必劳作而只是寻求快乐时，快乐的滋味却不知不觉溜走了——这足够证明他们既没有考虑也不懂得自己的问题！在讨论极其重要的个人问题时，没有人比明智的平凡人更加坦诚了，所有的朋友都来征求他睿智的意见。","Above all, he does not know that he is losing the capacity for pleasure. Indeed, if it were suggested that such a change was going on in him he would be vexed and distressed. He would cry out: “Don’t you make any mistake! I could amuse myself as well as any man, if only I got the chance!” And yet, how many tens of thousands of plain and (as it is called) successful men have been staggered to discover, when ambition was achieved and the daily yoke thrown off and the direct search for immediate happiness commenced, that the relish for pleasure had faded unnoticed away—proof enough that they had neither examined nor understood themselves! There is no more ingenuous soul, in affairs of supreme personal importance than your wise plain man, whom all his friends consult for his sagacity."
"请注意，我无意指责平凡人精神上的完全盲目，就像我无意仅仅因为平凡人走入一个房间时看不出别人怎样看待他，而指责他肉体上的完全盲目一样。因为没有人能够全面审视自己，也无法全面审视自己的事务；那些吹嘘自己能做到这一点的人再聪明也无异于傻子；这种人根本没有真正有用的智慧。但我要指责我的平凡人因为骄傲和懒惰而故意闭上眼睛。我要说，如果他不再于半夜自我怜悯和自我欣赏，而是开始用理智、努力且诚实的态度来审视自己的问题，不是在黑夜里这么做，而是在清醒的白天，他会对自己的事情了解得多得多。我还要说，这些自我审视如果做得得当，他也许就会少对妻子横加指责。","Mind, I am not hereby accusing the plain man of total spiritual blindness—any more than I would accuse him of total physical blindness because he cannot see how he looks to others when he walks into a room. For nobody can see all round himself, nor know absolutely all about his own case; and he who boasts that he can is no better than a fool, despite his wisdom; he is not even at the beginning of any really useful wisdom. But I do accuse my plain man of deliberately shutting his eyes, from pride and from sloth. I do say that he might know a great deal more about his case than he actually does know, if only he would cease from pitying and praising himself in the middle of the night, and tackle the business of self-examination in a rational, vigorous, and honest fashion—not in the dark, but in the sane sunlight. And I do further say that a self-examination thus properly conducted might have results which would stultify those outrageous remarks of his to his wife."
"三","3.0"
"很少有人——事实上几乎没有人——能意识到一句古语的珍贵价值：“认识你自己。”这话看起来陈腐又平常；好似很容易做到。这难道不是人人都会的吗？坐在椅子上陷入某种情绪不就行了吗？但实际上这种知识和中文一样难学。很确定地说，千分之九百九十九的人在六十岁之前连皮毛都没有了解到。我们大多数人到死时也几乎完全没有这种知识。也没人能说掌握了它所有令人兴奋的分支。为什么，你可以随便选一名朋友——就选最聪明的吧——然后立即告诉他他性格和行动中非常明显的特征。作为对你的回报，他会愤怒又认真地否认。你注意到了，他所有的朋友也注意到了，但他自己没有注意到。不但没注意到，他甚至确信这只是你不怀好意的揣测。比如说，去找一名以幽默感差而著称的朋友，温和地告诉他：“你缺乏幽默感，我的朋友，”看看他怎么对待这个信息。自我认识的稀缺性就是能到这种程度。","Few people—in fact, very few people indeed—ever realize the priceless value of the ancient counsel: “Know thyself.” It seems so trite, so ordinary. It seems so easy to acquire, this knowledge. Does not everyone possess it? Can it not be got by simply sitting down in a chair and yielding to a mood? And yet this knowledge is just about as difficult to acquire as a knowledge of Chinese. Certainly nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a thousand reach the age of sixty before getting the rudiments of it. The majority of us die in almost complete ignorance of it. And none may be said to master it in all its exciting branches. Why, you can choose any of your friends—the wisest of them—and instantly tell him something glaringly obvious about his own character and actions—and be rewarded for your trouble by an indignantly sincere denial! You had noticed it; all his friends had noticed it. But he had not noticed it. Far from having noticed it, he is convinced that it exists only in your malicious imagination. For example, go to a friend whose sense of humour is notoriously imperfect, and say gently to him: “Your sense of humour is imperfect, my friend,” and see how he will receive the information! So much for the rarity of self-knowledge."
"自我认识很难，因为它需要思想上的诚实，它要求一个人不能忽视事实、不能逃避现实、不能害怕环视周遭时可能看到的事情。自我认识很稀缺，因为它需要一个人能一直分辨出自己想要成为的人和实际的自己之间的区别，因为它需要公正的超然和一种优雅的、不怕羞耻的品质——这种不怕羞耻的品质让人能对自己坦白，并从坦白中得到合理的乐趣。因为自我认识太难以得到，作为补偿，对自我认识的追求碰巧是最让人着迷的追求之一，那些做得认真的人深有体会。它的好处无穷无尽，还会持续增多。令人不快的是，盎格鲁—撒克逊这个种族的脾性和它很不相容，拉丁人更喜欢它一些。要感受它的魅力，可以听一位很有教养的法国人为了亲密友人而对自己进行的分析。不过，盎格鲁—撒克逊人试试看也会有好处。","Self-knowledge is difficult because it demands intellectual honesty. It demands that one shall not blink the facts, that one shall not hide one’s head in the sand, and that one shall not be afraid of anything that one may happen to see in looking round. It is rare because it demands that one shall always be able to distinguish between the man one thinks one ought to be and the man one actually is. And it is rare because it demands impartial detachment and a certain quality of fine shamelessness—the shamelessness which confesses openly to oneself and finds a legitimate pleasure in confessing. By way of compensation for its difficulty, the pursuit of self-knowledge happens to be one of the most entrancing of all pursuits, as those who have seriously practiced it are well aware. Its interest is inexhaustible and grows steadily. Unhappily, the Anglo-Saxon racial temperament is inimical to it. The Latins like it better. To feel its charm one should listen to a highly-cultivated Frenchman analysing himself for the benefit of an intimate companion. Still, even Anglo-Saxons may try it with advantage."
"自我认识中的一个分支并不是特别难，它是解决平凡人眼下问题所特别需要的，它不涉及对罪孽、即便是对重大错误的认识。只需要简单地知道自己对什么感兴趣，觉得什么是无聊的。","The branch of self-knowledge which is particularly required for the solution of the immediate case of the plain man now under consideration is not a very hard one. It does not involve the recognition of crimes or even of grave faults. It is simply the knowledge of what interests him and what bores him."
"让平凡人坦诚地进入第一个环节吧：做他自己，并不要为此羞愧。让他一直记得，对别人喜欢的东西不感兴趣或喜欢别人不感兴趣的东西都不是罪孽。让他私下里问问自己会使他自由地发挥自己的天性，因为正是对天性本能的逐渐压抑才让他变得像现在这样萎靡。一开始他会用疲惫的声音咕哝说想不出有什么感兴趣的东西，然后让他挖掘自己深埋的天性，趁他还没有变成禁锢于恒定轨道的牺牲品前，回忆起过去灿烂的梦想。每个人都有或曾经有一个秘密的愿望，一个隐藏的愿望。让他找到自己现在或曾经的愿望——园艺、哲学、阅读、旅行、台球、养宠物、训练动物、打猎、游艇，收集图画、邮票、签名照、鼻烟壶或战利品，天文、放风筝、室内装修、外语、纸牌、游泳、写日记、舞台、政治、木工、骑马或开车、音乐、熬夜、早起、种树、砍树、城镇规划、业余军人、静力学、昆虫学、植物学、演讲、逗孩子、迷恋雪茄、爱妻、静谧的居家之夜、魔术、细菌学、测心术、机械学、地质学、绘图、打铃、神秘学、自己的灵魂、甚至高尔夫……","Let him enter upon the first section of it with candour. Let him be himself. And let him be himself without shame. Let him ever remember that it is not a sin to be bored by what interests others, or to be interested in what bores others. Let him in this private inquiry give his natural instincts free play, for it is precisely the gradual suppression of his natural instincts which has brought him to his present pass. At first he will probably murmur in a fatigued voice that he cannot think of anything at all that interests him. Then let him dig down among his buried instincts. Let him recall his bright past of dreams, before he had become a victim imprisoned in the eternal groove. Everybody has, or has had, a secret desire, a hidden leaning. Let him discover what his is, or was—gardening, philosophy, reading, travel, billiards, raising animals, training animals, killing animals, yachting, collecting pictures or postage-stamps or autographs or snuff-boxes or scalps, astronomy, kite-f lying, house-furnishing, foreign languages, cards, swimming, diary-keeping, the stage, politics, carpentry, riding or driving, music, staying up late, getting up early, tree-planting, tree-felling, town-planning, amateur soldiering, statics, entomology, botany, elocution, children-fancying, cigar-fancying, wife-fancying, placid domestic evenings, conjuring, bacteriology, thought-reading, mechanics, geology, sketching, bell-ringing, theosophy, his own soul, even golf…"
"在他秘密兴趣可能所在或曾经所在的一千万个方向中，我列出了一些。也许我没有正确列出他的兴趣，但他能找到，或许不用花什么力气就能找到好几个正确的方向。","I mention a few of the ten million directions in which his secret desire may point or have pointed. I have probably not mentioned the right direction. But he can find it. He can perhaps find several right directions without too much trouble."
"现在他说：","And now he says:"
"“我想你是让我开始从事其中的一项？”","“I suppose you mean me to take up one of these things?”"
"我的确这样想——这是基于看到他将如此清晰的一项职责忽视至今。如果他能早点着手，并且坚持下去，就不会陷入今天这种屈辱的境地，悲哀地宣称生活没有乐趣。","I do, seeing that he has hitherto neglected so clear a duty. If he had attended to it earlier, and with perseverance he would not be in the humiliating situation of exclaiming bitterly that he has no pleasure in life.  "
"“可是，”他坚持说到，“你明明知道我没有时间啊！”","“But,” he resists, “you know perfectly well that I have no time!” "
"我则只好这样回答他：","To which I am obliged to make reply:"
"“亲爱的先生，现在不是在跟你老婆谈话，好好地跟我说实话吧！”","“My dear sir, it is not your wife you are talking to. Kindly be honest with me.”"
"我承认平凡人的工作很耗费精力，要求又高。为了充分论证，我承认他不能马上毫无后顾之忧地缩减工作时间。即使这样，在他每星期醒着的一百一十个小时里，工作占用的时间至多也不会超过七十小时。余下的时间，要么在做无聊却必要的事情，要么在做不但无聊而且毫无必要的事情（因为他自己宣称没从生活中得到乐趣）——访友、举办餐会、打牌、读报纸、度过静谧的居家之夜、夜晚外出、去酒吧、无所事事地坐着、打扮自己、度周末、看戏、去古典音乐会、读文学作品、坐火车去郊外玩、熬夜、赶时髦、甚至打高尔夫。不管他消磨闲暇时光的方式是什么，这种方式都不对，只因为他觉得无聊。而且消磨闲暇本身就是个错误，闲暇和工作一样，也需要计划，而且需要规划成几大部分。","I admit that his business is very exhausting and exigent. For the sake of argument I will grant that he cannot safely give it an instant’s less time than he is now giving it. But even so his business does not absorb at the outside more than seventy hours of the hundred and ten hours during which he is wide awake each week. The rest of the time he spends either in performing necessary acts in a tedious way or in performing acts which are not only tedious to him, but utterly unnecessary (for his own hypothesis is that he gets no pleasure out of life)—visiting, dinner-giving, cards, newspaper-reading, placid domestic evenings, evenings out, bar-lounging, sitting aimlessly around, dandifying himself, weekending, theatres, classical concerts, literature, suburban train travelling, staying up late, being in the swim, even golf. In whatever manner he is whittling away his leisure, it is the wrong manner, for the sole reason that it bores him. Moreover, all whittling of leisure is a mistake. Leisure, like work, should be organized, and it should be organized in large pieces."
"正确的方法显然就是用可能有趣的活动来替换明显无聊的活动，并且这种变化要用脑子思考，用工作的精神执行。第一要务就是意识到必须丢弃一些东西。","The proper course clearly is to substitute acts which promise to be interesting for acts which have proved themselves to produce nothing but tedium, and to carry out the change with brains, in a business spirit. And the first essential is to recognize that something has definitely to go by the board."
"平凡人抗议说：","He protests:"
"“但我做的事都是平常的事——每个人都做的事！做完就该睡觉了。”","“But I do only the usual things—what everybody else does! And then it’s time to go to bed.”"
"但这里谈的是他的状况，不是每个人的状况。为什么仅仅为了和大家保持一致就要屈服于无休止的沉闷？","The case, however, is his case, not everybody else’s case. Why should he submit to everlasting boredom for the mere sake of acting like everybody else?"
"他继续坚持：","He continues in the same strain:"
"“但你在要求我改变整个生活——我都这么大年纪了！”","“But you are asking me to change my whole life—at my age!”"
"根本不是这样！我只是在建议他该开始真正的生活了。","Nothing of the sort! I am only suggesting that he should begin to live. And then finally he cries:"
"最后他终于叫道：“这太极端了。我没有这个勇气！”","“It’s too drastic. I haven’t the pluck!”"
"现在我们触到了关键问题。","Now we are coming to the real point."
"四","4.0"
"在平凡人的意志这个系统中，除了一个方向，其余全都堵塞住了，原因就是过于专业化导致的长时间忽略。他需要理清他的头脑，并且也可以理清——头脑能够自我理清——只要定期强迫它休息。可实际情况是它从未真正从工作中解脱出来休个假。我并不是说平凡人每时每刻都在考虑工作的事儿，而是说他一直都想着要考虑工作，工作总是萦绕在他脑中，即使是以潜伏的状态。一有机会，如果脑子没有想事儿，它就会暴躁地蹦出来寻求注意。这个人的脑子就像是一名不幸的家仆，尽管不是一直在工作，却从不歇班，日夜都不能从那该死的召唤电铃的威胁中解脱，而且这脑子还和家仆一样沉闷。平凡人的工作随时都可以按响召唤电铃，在他喝汤的时候，在他于暖暖的夏夜和妻子单独坐在一起的时候，特别是在他天亮前醒来自我怜悯和自我赞美的时候。","The machinery of his volition, in all directions save one, has been clogged, through persistent neglect, due to over-specialization. His mind needs to be cleared, and it can be cleared—it will clear itself—if regular periods of repose are enforced upon it. As things are, it practically never gets a holiday from business. I do not mean that the plain man is always thinking about his business; but I mean that he is always liable to think about his business, that his business is always present in his mind, even if dormant there, and that at every opportunity, if the mind happens to be inactive, it sits up querulously and insists on attention. The man’s mind is indeed rather like an unfortunate domestic servant who, though not always at work, is never off duty, never night or day free from the menace of a damnable electric bell; and it is as stale as that servant. His business is capable of ringing the bell when the man is eating his soup, when he is sitting alone with his wife on a warm summer evening, and especially when he wakes just before dawn to pity and praise himself."
"但他为这种情况辩护说：","But he defends the position:"
"“我的工作需要考虑很多——要一直保持警觉。”","“My business demands much reflection—constant watchfulness.”"
"首先，如果一项事业需要同一个人日夜保持警觉，那就是组织得太差，应该重新规划。这和大自然的常识是相悖的。其次，平凡人的辩护很虚假。他屈服于这无止境的劳心不是因为觉得理所应当，而仅仅是因为忍不住。有多次，特别是在天亮前，他希望不用这样徒劳地魂不守舍，好再次进入梦乡——可是不能如愿！有多少次，在欢乐的聚会中，他私下里不觉得百无聊赖，因为脑子里那个霸道的念想像是一只发条老鼠一样转个不停，没有任何实际用途也不能让他真正融入周围欢乐的环境中去！","Well, in the first place, an enterprise which demands watchfulness day and night from the same individual is badly organized, and should be reorganized. It runs contrary to the common sense of Nature. And, in the second place, his defence is insincere. He does not submit to the eternal preoccupation because he thinks he ought, but simply because he cannot help it. How often, especially just before the dawn, has he not longed to be delivered from the perfectly futile preoccupation, so that he might go to sleep again—and failed to get free! How often, in the midst of some jolly gathering, has he not felt secretly desolate because the one tyrannic topic would run round and round in his mind, just like a clockwork mouse, accomplishing no useful end, and making impossible any genuine participation in the gaiety that environs him!"
"这种病态的劳心不是平凡人工作成功的必要条件，反而对其很有害。如果能够每天至少连续十三个小时根本不去想工作，那平凡人考虑起工作来会更有实效、更有力量，也更有创造力。","Instead of being necessary to the success of his business, this morbid preoccupation is positively detrimental to his business. He would think much more usefully, more powerfully, more creatively, about his business if during at least thirteen consecutive hours each day he never thought of it at all."
"关于这个问题还有另一点。平凡人可以想象一下，那些与他相亲相爱的家人，他理论上为之工作的那些人，如果一直觉得他只是从工作的余晖中模模糊糊看见他们，会有何感受！唉，情况会更糟！即使当和妻子坐在一起时，两人也是在隔着铁窗交谈，旁边站着的看守听着每一个字。想想这会让她感到多么夸张啊！如果他想的是另一个女人而不是工作，她也许还能更夸张，最起码会感到震惊。如果他每天下午能够把工作关在门外，不仅对自己和工作有好处，妻子也会露出充满智慧的温暖笑容。和大多数女人一样，他妻子对于生活本质的把握比对所依靠的男人的把握更加坚定。她从心里知道（他只是脑子里知道）工作、政治这类东西对于真正的生活来说都是第二位的，只是生存的初步基础。在平凡人赞美她时，她会红着脸暗自高兴，丈夫终于开始懂得最有价值的东西了！","And there is still a further point in this connection. Let him imagine how delightful it must be for the people in the home which he has made, the loving people whom he loves and to whom in theory he is devoting his career, to feel continually that he only sees them obscurely through the haze emanating from his business! Why—worse!—even when he is sitting with his wife, he and she might as well be communicating with each other across a grille against which a turnkey is standing and listening to every word said! Let him imagine how flattering for her! She might be more flattered, at any rate more thrilled, if she knew that instead of thinking about his business he was thinking about another woman. Could he shut the front door every afternoon on his business, the effect would not only be beneficial upon it and upon him, but his wife would smile the warm smile of wisdom justified. Like most women, she has a firmer grasp of the essence of life than the man upon whom she is dependent. She knows with her heart (what he only knows with his brain) that business, politics, and all that sort of thing are secondary to real existence, the mere preliminaries of it. She would rejoice, in the blush of the compliment he was paying her, that he had at last begun to comprehend the ultimate values!"
"据我所知，还没有哪种专利设备可以控制头脑，让人从平凡人的困扰中解脱出来。但要达到这个目的，可以用一种平凡无奇的方法循序渐进。如果有这种困扰的人每次发现自己工作之外的时间还在想着工作，就刻意去想其他事，或者什么都不想，他大概早晚（可能两周左右），就能摆脱这习惯，或者至少占个上风。这种治疗需要恒心，但并不特别需要付出无法完成的努力，只是需要对小事的那份坚持。","So far as I am aware, there is no patent device for suddenly gaining that control of the mind which will enable one to free it from an obsession such as the obsession of the plain man. The desirable end can, however, be achieved by slow degrees, and by an obvious method which contains naught of the miraculous. If the victim of the obsession will deliberately try to think of something else, or to think of nothing at all—every time he catches himself in the act of thinking about his business out of hours, he certainly will, sooner or later—probably in about a fortnight—cure the obsession, or at least get the upper hand of it. The treatment demands perseverance, but it emphatically does not demand an impossibly powerful effort. It is an affair of trifling pertinacious touches."
"这个方法在白天比较容易执行，在公司里能让人分心的事情很多，但在夜里独自一人时就不那么容易了。在没什么活力又容易自我膨胀的夜间时段，与某种习惯做斗争并取得胜利非常不易。但白天持续获得的小小成功会逐渐间接地影响夜晚。简单却坚决的建议也能有很大功效。似乎很少有人知道，尽管这是个事实，下决心最有效的时刻是入睡之前那段昏沉平静的时间。人体的整个机能在那时都处于被动的状态，比起一天二十四小时中的其他时间，更容易让意志的烙印留下永恒的痕迹。如果一个人有规律地在那个时刻清晰又坚定地对自己说：“我不会在家里还想着工作，我不会在家里还想着工作，我不会在家里还想着工作，”效果会让他大吃一惊。顺便说一下，这个效果是通过潜意识达到的，我们对它不可观察的工作方式只能猜测。","It is a treatment easier to practise during daylight, in company, when distractions are plentiful, than in the solitude of the night. Triumphantly to battle with an obsession at night, when the vitality is low and the egoism intensified, is extremely difficult. But the small persistent successes of the day will gradually have their indirect influence on the night. A great deal can also be done by simple resolute suggestion. Few persons seem to know—what is, nevertheless, a fact—that the most effective moment for making resolves is in the comatose calm which precedes going to sleep. The entire organism is then in a passive state, and more permanently receptive of the imprint of volition than at any other period of the twenty-four hours. If regularly at that moment the man says clearly and imperiously to himself, “I will not allow my business to preoccupy me at home; I will not allow my business to preoccupy me at home; I will not allow my business to preoccupy me at home,” he will be astonished at the results; which results, by the way, are reached by subconscious and therefore unperceived channels whose workings we can only guess at."
"当这个习惯被打败、被消灭时，平凡人发现他不仅仅多了开始生活中新兴趣的必要勇气和主动性，天性也会主动要求开始这新兴趣，因为天性已得到解放。","And when the obsession is beaten, destroyed, he will find himself not merely fortified with the necessary pluck and initiative for importing anew interest into his existence. His instincts of their own accord will be asking for that interest, for they will have been set free."
"五","5.0"
"要选一件分心的事物——也就是说给工作选个对手——平凡人应该挑选和他工作性质尽可能不同的事情，这样可以激活他性格中的另一面。如果他的工作单调，需要的是细心与热忱而不是强度不规律的脑力劳动，那就选择一件需要大动脑筋的事情。但另一方面，如果他的工作需要绞尽脑汁应对突发事件，那就选择个傻乎乎的娱乐活动。很多人错误地以为自己的爱好必须和工作一样体面又严肃，不过最伟大的哲学家们的例子能让他们意识到错误！他们似乎以为必须不断地在体力或脑力上改进自己。他们选择一项运动，那是因为该运动可以锻炼身体。而如果爱好是脑力活动，那就一定是用来开发智力的。事实上他们对于自我改进的认识太狭隘了。按照他们对这个词组的狭义定义，这些人大可不必改进了；也许他们已经进步得让周围的人都厌烦了；他们需要的可能是退步一些。从广义上全面理解自我改进一词，自我退化倒是可能改进他们。我就认识这样的人——大家一定都认识这类人——如果他们日常能够再随意一点、再心不在焉一点、再不合逻辑一点、再不那么理智一点、再幼稚欢快一点、再无所顾忌一点，就日臻完美了。平凡人在觉得某些爱好不足取而要放弃时，最好能再考虑考虑这几点。","In choosing a distraction—that is to say, in choosing a rival to his business—he should select some pursuit whose nature differs as much as possible from the nature of his business, and which will bring into activity another side of his character. If his business is monotonous, demanding care and solicitude rather than irregular intense efforts of the brain, then let his distraction be such as will make a powerful call upon his brain. But if, on the other hand, the course of his business runs in crises that string up the brain to its tightest strain, then let his distraction be a foolish and merry one. Many men fall into the error of assuming that their hobbies must be as dignified and serious as their vocations, though surely the example of the greatest philosophers ought to have taught them better! They seem to imagine that they should continually be improving themselves, in either body or mind. If they take up a sport, it is because the sport may improve their health. And if the hobby is intellectual it must needs be employed to improve their brain. The fact is that their conception of self-improvement is too narrow. In their restricted sense of the phrase, they possibly don’t need improving; they possibly are already improved to the point of being a nuisance to their fellow-creatures; possibly what they need is worsening. In the broad and full sense of the phrase self-improvement, a course of self-worsening might improve them. I have known men—and everybody has known them—who would approach nearer to perfection if they could only acquire a little carelessness, a little absent-mindedness, a little illogicalness, a little irrational and infantile gaiety, a little unscrupulousness in the matter of the time of day. These considerations should be weighed before certain hobbies are dismissed as being unworthy of a plain man’s notice."
"接下来该做决定了，明智的平凡人会用上所有的意志力，在家里他的意志力可是出了名的。因为这个时刻是非常重要的——也许会是他生命中一个阶段的结束和另一个阶段的开始。集中的意志力越多，他就越有可能成功地开展自己的复兴大业。他求婚时用上了多少意志力，这次也要用上多少来做出决定。而且他的确需要准备好，像对待心爱的女人那样对待这个爱好——用上极好的、毫不算计的慷慨大方。他得在这方面砸钱，另外，还要花上大量时间。所以一定要处理得当。一项爱好如果没赔上点儿真正的牺牲，就根本不能升格为真正的爱好。如果选择的爱好既花钱又费时间，如果这个爱好对于一个忙碌又谨慎的人很难实现，就更好了。如果这爱好会让工作受点儿影响，还危及生平的勤奋习惯，那就更好了。因为，很明显，尽管平凡人会为此惴惴不安，但其实他的工作不会受影响，保持了一生的习惯，即使是那些好习惯，也不会那么轻易被危及。平凡人得到的最宝贵的建议之一就是要养成勤奋的习惯，然后试着将其丢掉！很快他就会发现这些习惯根本丢不掉，但与它们短暂的抗争总能让他的天性恢复得健全且平衡。","Then comes the hour of decision, in which the wise plain man should exert all that force of will for which he is famous in his house. For this hour may be of supreme importance—may be the close of one epoch in his life and the beginning of another. The more volitional energy he can concentrate in it, the more likely is he to succeed in the fine enterprise of his own renaissance. He must resolve with as much intensity of will as he once put into the resolution which sent him to propose marriage to his wife. And, indeed, he must be ready to treat his hobby some what as though it were a woman desired—with splendid and uncalculating generosity. He must shower money on it, and, what is more, he must shower time on it. He must do the thing properly. A hobby is not a hobby until it is glorified, until some real sacrifice has been made for it. If he has chosen a hobby that is costly, both in money and in time, if it is a hobby difficult for a busy and prudent man to follow, all the better. If it demands that his business shall suffer a little, and that his life-long habits of industry shall seem to be jeopardized, again all the better. For, you know, despite his timid fears, his business will not suffer, and lifelong habits, even good ones, are not easily jeopardized. One of the most precious jewels of advice ever offered to the plain man was that he should acquire industrious habits, and then try to lose them! He will soon find that he cannot lose them, but the transient struggles against them will tend always to restore the sane balance of his nature."
"平凡人寻求乐趣的时候特意将其与爱好联系起来，而且联系得越频繁越好。至少每周一次，他的计划里要包括某项令人迫不及待的放松活动，因为活动是他计划的，而且还为此把看似更紧迫的事情都推到了一边。他必须要期待事先品尝这乐趣，期待品尝两次！这样才能重树对乐趣的热望和品味乐趣的能力——而且当晚年来临，他开始安逸的生活时，还能再好好回味。说了这么多必要事项，当享受真正来临时，他必须让头脑放松。清除一切杂念，像年轻人一样淡定地接受风险，让自己完全投入到这一时刻。让他像做慈善事业一样经营这无忧无虑的状态吧，而这的确算得上慈善事业——比如说对于他的家庭。不信就去问问他的家人。","He must deliberately arrange pleasures for himself in connection with his hobby, and as often as possible. Once a week at least his programme should comprise some item of relaxation to which he can look forward with impatience because he has planned it, and because he has compelled seemingly more urgent matters to give way to it ;and look forward to it he must, tasting it in advance, enjoying it twice over! Thus may the appetite for pleasure, the ability really to savour it, be restored—and incidentally kept in good trim for full use when old age arrives and he enters the lotus-land. And with it all, when the hour of enjoyment comes, he must insist on his mind being free; expelling every preoccupation, nonchalantly accepting risks like a youth, he must abandon himself to the hour. Let him practise lightheartedness as though it were charity. Indeed, it is charity—to his household, for instance. Ask his household."
"他说：","He says:"
"“这一切太危险。我的朋友会认不出我，我可能做得太过火，成为游手好闲的挥霍者。”","“All this is very dangerous. My friends won’t recognize me. I may go too far. I may become an idler and a spendthrift.”"
"不必惧怕。","Have no fear."

"由于命运安排的一次偶然，下面我要写到的这两位截然不同的平凡人，分别叫做阿尔法先生和欧米加先生。由于脾性不同，他们天差地别，是两个极端。","By one of those coincidences for which destiny is sometimes responsible, the two very opposite plain men whom I am going to write about were most happily named Mr. Alpha and Mr. Omega; for, owing to a difference of temperament, they stood far apart, at the extreme ends of the scale."
"当然，年轻时他们的差别还不明显；这类差别在年轻时很少会完全显现。差别第一次激烈地体现出来是在一天晚上，阿尔法先生想去剧院，而欧米加先生不愿意去。这时他们两人都是年轻的已婚人士，两对夫妇同住在一套公寓里。而且两人的事业发展得都不错，也就是说，他俩熨得平整的裤子口袋里都有几个叮当响的闲钱。","In youth, of course, the differences between them were not fully apparent; such differences seldom are fully apparent in youth. It first made itself felt in a dramatic way, on the evening when Mr. Alpha wanted to go to the theatre and Mr. Omega didn’t. At this period they were both young and both married, and the two couples shared a flat together. Also, they were both getting on very well in their careers, by which is meant that they both had spare cash to rattle in the pockets of their admirably creased trousers."
"“今晚和我们一起去看戏好吗，欧米加？”阿尔法先生问。","“Come to the theatre with us tonight, Omega?” said Mr. Alpha."
"“我们不去了。”欧米加先生说。","“I don’t think we will,” said Mr. Omega."
"“但我们很想让你们去。”阿尔法先生坚持道。","“But we particularly want you to,” insisted Mr. Alpha."
"“恐怕不行。”欧米加先生说。","“Well, it can’t be done,” said Mr. Omega."
"“你们另外有约了？”","“Got another engagement?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“那为什么不去？你不会说你缺钱吧？”","“Then why won’t you come? You don’t mean to tell me you’re hard up?”"
"“我的确缺钱。”欧米加先生说。","“Yes, I do,” said Mr. Omega."
"“你可真该感到羞愧。你最近把钱都花到哪儿去了？”","“Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself. What have you been doing with your money lately?”"
"“我刚办了一份儿比较大额的人身保险，保险费让我的经济有点紧张。昨天刚付了第一笔保险金。我捉襟见肘了。”","“I’ve taken out a biggish life assurance policy, and the premiums will be a strain. I paid the first yesterday. I’m bled white.”"
"“我的老天！”阿尔法先生惊呼，耸了耸肩膀。","“Holy Moses!” exclaimed Mr. Alpha, shrugging his shoulders."
"不久后公寓就开始招租。“我的老天！”这声惊呼如果以适当而友好的语调发出，本身也许无碍，不会伤及友谊。不幸的是阿尔法先生用了种讽刺的语调，暗示欧米加先生是个道学先生、自取烦恼的老年人、守财奴、扫兴的人，也就是说很不够男人。","The flat was shortly afterwards to let. The exclamation “Holy Moses!” may be in itself quite harmless, and innocuous to friendship, if it is pronounced in the right, friendly tone. Unfortunately Mr. Alpha used it with a sarcastic inflection, implying that he regarded Mr. Omega as a prig, a fussy old person, a miser, a spoil-sport, and, indeed, something less than a man."
"“你只能活这一辈子啊，”阿尔法先生说。","“You can only live your life once,” said Mr. Alpha."
"此后他们的人生轨迹就分道扬镳了。那是1893年。","And they curved gradually apart. This was in 1893."

"将近二十年后——也就是在那之后不久——我在一个周六看到了阿尔法先生吃午餐。别以为阿尔法先生会在一间寒酸的小阁楼里进周六午餐，四周满是破败、失意的氛围。人生的成功很少取决于谨小慎微，而是取决于勇气、主动性和个人能力，当然也不是和运气完全无关。","Nearly twenty years later—that is to say, not long since—I had a glimpse of Mr. Alpha at a Saturday lunch. Do not imagine that Mr. Alpha’s Saturday lunch took place in a miserable garret, amid every circumstance of failure and shame. Success in life has very little to do with prudence. It has a great deal to do with courage, initiative, and individual force, and also it is not unconnected with sheer luck."
"阿尔法先生是个成功人士，我和他在一所宽敞、舒适的大房子里共同享用了这顿午餐。房子周围环绕着花园、温室、车库、马厩等房子所需要的一切附加设施。阿尔法先生是一个快活的好心人，非常精明，也很多产。我说他多产是因为他有五个子女。他与妻子和五个孩子一起享受着这顿午餐，心情非常愉快。和他们相处是件开心的事儿。","Mr. Alpha had succeeded in life, and the lunch at which I assisted took place in a remarkably spacious and comfortable house surrounded by gardens, greenhouses, garages, stables, and all the minions necessary to the upkeep thereof. Mr. Alpha was a jolly, a kind-hearted, an immensely clever, and a prolific man. I call him prolific because he had five children. There he was, with his wife and the five children; and they were all enjoying the lunch and themselves to an extraordinary degree. It was a delight to be with them."
"和那些聪明、脾气好、活泼又有足够的钱来满足自己欲望的人相处起来绝对是件愉快的事。你几乎可以听见金子的叮当声，而这声音听起来很悦耳。最小的女孩子在漂亮的新钱包里也有钱，可以随意花，因为阿尔法先生从不吝啬，他天性慷慨，希望人人都快乐。实际上，他堪称一位不寻常的父亲，同时又不是无条件地默许和纵容。比如说，他最小的孩子，一个女孩，在那顿午餐时提起了音乐这个话题。她十四岁了，在学校的音乐考试中展露出从父亲那里继承来的聪明。她对自己的音乐事业情绪高涨。“我能不能开始系统地学音乐呢，爸爸？”她问道，带着那个年纪所能有的郑重。","It is necessarily a delight to be with people who are intelligent, sympathetic and lively, and who have ample money to satisfy their desires. Somehow you can hear the gold chinking, and the sound is good to the human ear. Even the youngest girl had money in her nice new purse, to do with it as she liked. For Mr. Alpha never stinted. He was generous by instinct, and he wanted everybody to be happy. In fact, he had turned out quite an unusual father. At the same time he fell short of being an absolute angel of acquiescence and compliance. For instance, his youngest child, a girl, broached the subject of music at that very lunch. She was fourteen, and had shown some of her father’s cleverness at a school musical examination. She was rather uplifted about her music. “Can’t I take it up seriously, dad?” she said, with the extreme gravity of her years."
"“当然了，”他说，“你弹得越好我们就越高兴。你不觉得我们在忍受你钢琴练习的折磨之后，应该有所回报了吗？”","“Of course,” said he. “The better you play, the more we shall all be pleased. Don’t you think we deserve some reward for all we’ve suffered under your piano-practising?”"
"她脸红了。","She blushed."
"“我是说系统地好好学。”她坚持道。","“But I mean seriously,” she insisted."
"“好了，乖孩子。”他说，“你不会是以为自己可以成为一个出名的钢琴家吧？一场演奏会挣三百镑什么的？”她正坐在他身边，所以他宠溺地捏了捏她可爱的耳朵。","“Well, my pet,” said he, “you don’t reckon you could be a star pianist, do you? Three hundred pounds a concert, and so on?” And, as she was sitting next to him, he affectionately pinched her delicious ear."
"“没有，”她承认，“但我可以教钢琴。我应该会喜欢教课。”","“No,” she admitted. “But I could teach. I should like to teach.”"
"“教课！”他用变了调的声音重复道，“教课！我的天，你要教课干什么？我可不想看到自己的女儿当老师。”","“Teach!” He repeated the word in a changed tone. “Teach! What in Heaven’s name should you want to teach for? I don’t quite see a daughter of mine teaching.”"
"这个话题到此为止了。","No more was said on the subject."
"这位年轻女士和我的私交好到可以倾吐心事。","The young woman and I are on rather confidential terms."
"“真丢脸，不是吗？”她事后对我感叹说。","“It is a shame, isn’t it?” she said to me afterwards, with feeling."
"“没别的办法了吗？”我问。","“Nothing to be done?” I inquired."
"“没有。”她说，“我开口前就知道不行。爸爸根本不愿听到我说要自力更生。”","“Nothing,” said she. “I knew there wasn’t before I started. The dad would never hear of me earning my own living.”"
"两个大些的女孩是一对双胞胎，对音乐没兴趣；她们除了家庭生活和社交活动，对什么都不感兴趣。她们的日子过得很奢华，而越奢华，阿尔法先生对她们天堂般的生活越感到满意。他真是一位不可多得的父亲。孩子们自己也这么承认，他们很有判断力。二儿子希望成为一名画家。很多父亲会这么说：“我可不想听到关于画画的一派胡言。有正经事情在那儿，你给我去做正经事。”但阿尔法先生不是这样。他对二儿子这么说：“有个儿子能成为画家我很高兴。放手去做吧，别担心，也别急。你努力闯荡的这几年我会给你足够的钱维生。你不会和其他新手一样，除了自己的事业你什么都不要担心。你只要等着就行，不用上赶着找画商，舒舒服服地等着画商来找你吧。”","The two elder girls—twins—had no leaning towards music, and no leaning towards anything save family affection and social engagements. They had a grand time, and the grander the time they had the keener was the delight of Mr. Alpha in their paradisaical existence. Truly he was a pearl among fathers. The children themselves admitted it, and children can judge. The second son wished to be a painter. Manya father would have said, “I shall stand none of this nonsense about painting. The business is there, and into the business you’ll go.” But not Mr. Alpha. What Mr. Alpha said to his second son amounted to this: “I shall be charmed for a son of mine to be a painter. Go ahead. Don’t worry. Don’t hurry. I will give you an ample allowance to keep you a float through the years of struggle. You shall not be like other beginners. You shall have nothing to think of but your profession. You shall be in a position to wait. Instead of you running after the dealers, you shall comfortably bide your time until the dealers run after you.”"
"这位十八岁的年轻人早熟又奢侈。","This young man of eighteen was precocious and extravagant."
"“我说，妈妈，”他隔着面前的干酪问，“你能借给我十镑吗？”阿尔法先生突然插话：","“I say, mater,” he said, over the cheese, “can you lend me ten pounds?”Mr. Alpha broke in sharply:"
"“你问你妈妈要钱做什么？你知道我不喜欢你这样。我也不允许你欠债。”","“What are you worrying your mother about money for? You know I won’t have it. And I won’t have you getting into debt either.”"
"“那么，爸爸，你能买我一幅画吗？”","“Well, dad, will you buy a picture from me?”"
"“给你妈妈好好画一幅素描吧，我会花十镑来买。”","“Do me a good sketch of your mother, and I’ll give you ten pounds for it.”"
"“能不能先付钱？”","“Cash in advance?”"
"“好，只要你保证。但说好了，不能欠债。”","“Yes—on your promise. But understand, no debts.”"
"大儿子还算有出息，正在做正经工作。不过他也没太上心，只是定时去办公室。他将成为合伙人，最终这事业会传给他。但他才不会为生意皱一下眉头，因为阿尔法先生随时会负起一切责任，照管一切。他有足够的脑力和精力，甚至还有余力，的确，足够应付家事。阿尔法太太一想到丈夫能为自己解决一切问题，夜里总是能睡得安稳。他做什么都比她有效率得多，不论是和厨子或工匠打交道，还是决定花床里花的造型。","The eldest son, fitly enough, was in the business. Not, however, too much in the business. He put in time at the office regularly. He was going to be a partner, and the business would ultimately descend to him. But the business wrinkled not his brow. Mr. Alpha was quite ready to assume every responsibility and care. He had brains and energy enough, and something considerable over. Enough over, indeed, to run the house and grounds. Mrs. Alpha could always sleep soundly at night secure in the thought that her husband would smooth away every difficulty for her. He could do all things so much more efficiently than she could, were it tackling a cook or a tradesman, or deciding about the pattern of flowers in a gardenbed."
"午餐结束时，那位一直在沉思的画家，突然举起杯子。","At the finish of the luncheon the painter, who had been meditative, suddenly raised his glass."
"“女士们，先生们，”他郑重地宣布，“我祝父亲身体健康。”","“Ladies and gentlemen,” he announced, with solemnity, “I beg to move that father be and hereby is a brick.”"
"“我也是。”大儿子说。","“Carried nem. con.,” said the eldest son."
"“干杯！”两个活泼的双胞胎说。","“Loud cheers!” said the more pert of the twins."
"阿尔法先生陶醉在他的家和家庭生活中。","And Mr. Alpha was enchanted with his home and his home-life."
"三","3.0"
"阿尔法给我留下了很多印象，这些印象一直影响着我对这位出色、成功又讨人喜欢的先生的态度，而这次午餐是一系列事件中最新的一件，影响也最深远。我走回了家，路程大概是三英里，然后又在书房里的旧地毯上踱了三英里，最后我终于抑制不住自己的情绪，于是坐下给我的朋友阿尔法写了一封信。信是这样的：","That luncheon was the latest and the most profound of a long series of impressions which had been influencing my mental attitude towards the excellent, the successful, the entirely agreeable Mr. Alpha. I walked home, a distance of some three miles, and then I walked another three miles or so on the worn carpet of my study, and at last the cup of my feelings began to run over, and I sat down and wrote a letter to my friend Alpha. The letter was thus couched:"
"“亲爱的阿尔法：","“My Dear Alpha,"
"“很久以来我一直想告诉你一些事，现在我决定遵从自己的愿望。有两种告知你的方式：我可以用迂回的方式，用拐弯抹角又温和的语句，通过暗示和精心措辞提供建议，建立一个甜蜜客气的表象；我也可以直言不讳。也许后一种方法是最好的。","“I have long wanted to tell you something, and now I have decided to give vent to my desire. There are two ways of telling you. I might take the circuitous route by roundabout and gentle phrases, through hints and delicately undulating suggestions, and beneath the soft shadow of flattering cajoleries. Or I might dash straight ahead. The latter is the best, perhaps."
"“你是个恶棍，我亲爱的阿尔法。我用最友好也最残忍的方式来告诉你。你不仅是一个恶棍，而且是最危险的那一类——微笑的、好心肠的恶棍。"," “You are a scoundrel, my dear Alpha. I say it in the friendliest and most brutal manner. And you are not merely a scoundrel—you are the most dangerous sort of scoundrel—the smiling, benevolent scoundrel."
"“你很清楚，你的家庭，你家里所有的一切，都正处在悬崖边上，随时都有可能被山崩推入永久的毁灭，而你却表现得好像你的家庭是建在一片宽广、安全的平原上，一切想象得到的危险都伤害不到它。当然这里我是在打比方。你家庭所处的地方不是真的悬崖边缘，而是比喻中的悬崖，但悬崖所象征的危险却是实实在在的。","“You know quite well that your house, with all that therein is, stands on the edge of a precipice, and that at any moment a landslip might topple it over into everlasting ruin. And yet you behave as though your house was planted in the midst of a vast and secure plain, sheltered from every imaginable havoc. I speak metaphorically, of course. It is not a material precipice that your house stands on the edge of; it is a metaphorical precipice. But the perils symbolized by that precipice are real enough."
"“比如说，现实中一个司机的动作稍有偏差，就能把你从无与伦比的阿尔法变成一条死亡记录。就在这一刻，可能一个真实存在的细菌正在不辞劳苦地使你猝死。又或者另一个真实的细菌已经决定让你无助地死去，连躺都来不及。","“It is, for example, a real chauffeur whose real wrist may by a single false movement transform you from the incomparable Alpha into an item in the books of the registrar of deaths. It is a real microbe who may at this very instant be industriously planning your swift destruction. And it is another real microbe who may have already made up his or her mind that you shall finish your days helpless and incapable on the flat of your back."
"“假设你已经死了，会发生些什么呢？你会留下债务，因为尽管你有偿还能力，但这偿还能力仅仅是建立在你挣钱的能力上，死亡会让你马上变得没有偿还能力。你属于那种大胆、欢快、挣多少花多少的人。的确，你顺应潮流地参加了保险，但保险的金额微不足道，能带来的收益不到你现在收入的百分之一。当然你还有生意，但没了你，你的生意就会一钱不值。你本身就是自己的生意，但一旦没了你，剩下的残渣就不值一提。如果你把它交给儿子，他不到一年就会因无知和笨拙把它败光；你像让少女保留童贞一样保留他的不谙世事。你说是不想累着他，但根本不是这样。你仅仅是因为过于珍惜权威和自己不可或缺的感觉。你热切地希望人人都依靠你……","“Suppose you to be dead—what would happen? You would leave debts, for, although you are solvent, you are only solvent because you have the knack of always putting your hand on money, and death would automatically make you insolvent. You are one of those brave, jolly fellows who live up to their income. It is true that, in deference to fashion, you are now insured, but for a trifling and inadequate sum which would not yield the hundredth part of your present income. It is true that there is your business. But your business would be naught without you. You are your business. Remove yourself from it, and the residue is negligible. Your son, left alone with it, would wreck it in a year through simple ignorance and clumsiness; for you have kept him in his inexperience like a maiden in her maidenhood. You say that you desired to spare him. Nothing of the kind. You were merely jealous, of your authority, and your indispensability. You desired fervently that all and everybody should depend on yourself…"
"“想象一下三年后，你死了，被埋葬在冰冷的黑暗中。葬礼已经结束，朋友也已散去，但你的家人还活着。灾难没有毁灭你的家庭，它甚至还和以往一样有活力，悼念还没结束时他们就需要和以前一样吃喝。透过草皮看看吧，看见那个玩剃刀的孩子了吗？那是你的大儿子在执掌你的生意。看见另一个孩子以铅笔为武器对抗一只狼了吗？那是你二儿子。他们都是男孩子，必须像男子汉一样面对命运。但看见那四个砍掉了手、被扔在妖孽横生的沙漠中的人了吗？她们是你的妻女。是你把她们的手砍掉了，是你好心地劝哄着她们砍掉的。这就是为什么你是个恶棍……","“Conceive that three years have passed and that you are in fact dead. You are buried; you are lying away over there in the cold dark. The funeral is done. The friends are gone. But your family is just as alive as ever. Disaster has not killed it, nor even diminished its vitality. It wants just as much to eat and drink as it did before sorrow passed over it. Look through the sod. Do you see that child there playing with a razor? It is your eldest son at grips with your business. Do you see that other youngster striving against a wolf with a lead pencil for weapon? It is your second son. Well, they are males, these two, and must manfully expect what they get. But do you see these four creatures with their hands cut off, thrust out into the infested desert? They are your wife and your daughters. You cut their hands off. You did it so kindly and persuasively. And that chiefly is why you are a scoundrel…"
"“你按照一个错误的、可憎的教条教育了这些女人，你让她们相信，并强迫她们按这个信条行动：金钱是神奇的东西，她们对金钱有神奇的力量。她们只需要按一个按钮，或是用某种可爱的语调说话，钱就会像摩西的岩石流出水一样源源流出。而且目前对她们来说，金钱的确就是这样很方便地得来的。","“You educated all these women in a false and abominable doctrine. You made them believe, and you forced them to act up to the belief, that money was a magic thing, and that they had a magic power over it. All they had to do was to press a certain button, or to employ a certain pretty tone, and money would flow forth like water from the rock of Moses1. And so far as they were concerned money actually did behave in this convenient fashion."
"“但一直以来你都在用诡计欺骗她们，就好像邪教的牧师欺骗他们的信徒……更糟的是，你教给她们金钱只有一种用途——用来花。你也许可以凭运气留给妻子一笔钱，但她只会花销。她听说过投资这回事，于是也试着投资。可是，上帝保佑你，你从没对她讲过一个关于投资的字，结果金钱只会魔术般地从她手里消失，就像以前魔术般来到她手里一样。","“But all the time you were deceiving them by a conjuring-trick, just as priests of strange cults deceive their votaries… And further, you taught them that money had but one use—to be spent. You may—though by a fluke—have left a quantity of money to your widow, but her sole skill is to spend it. She has heard that there is such a thing as investing money. She tries to invest it. But, bless you, you never said a word to her about that, and the money vanishes now as magically as it once magically appeared in her lap."
"“是的，是你让这四个女人的生活根本离不了金钱、奢华、仆人和懒散，否则就不能忍受。更糟的是，你强迫她们一旦没有了钱就根本活不下去，更不要谈生活得如何了。她们要么在痛苦中死去——和你一起度过奢华生活之后！——要么就必须顺从地以卖笑为生。（因为你把她们的手砍掉了。）她们必须靠乞讨获得饱暖，而乞讨的方式不止一种。","“Yes, you compelled all these four women to live so that money and luxury and servants and idleness were absolutely essential to them if their existence was to be tolerable. And what is worse, you compelled them to live so that, deprived of magic money, they were incapable of existing at all, tolerably or intolerably. Either they must expire in misery—after their splendid career with you!—or they must earn existence by smiles and acquiescences and caresses. (For you cut their hands off.) They must beg for their food and raiment. There are different ways of begging."
"“但你抗议说，你所做的一切都是出于好意，因为你想让她们过得幸福。我的好人阿尔法，一个男人辩护说为了一个女人好而砍去她的手是很荒谬的！人天性多疑，容易往坏处想，这样的辩解很难让人信服。我是个容易轻信的人，但就连我也不能接受这个理由。而且我要说，如果你真的是出于好意这样做，那么真可惜你不是个天生残酷的人。残酷反而会更好些。你不允许小女儿去学维生的技能是出于好意吗？你阻挠她的天性，让她可能一生都充满悔恨是出于好意吗？不是。在讨论你儿子的问题时，我已经说了一个真正的原因。另一个原因是你为身边有这些纯粹的装饰品和可爱的小生灵而感到骄傲，你不愿意看到他们对其他事情的兴趣超过对你的兴趣，不愿意他们在完善你的事业、证明你世俗的成功这个功能外还有其他功能。如果女儿要弹钢琴，那她就要为完善你的家庭和满足你的乐趣与虚荣而弹，而不能有别的目的。你如愿以偿了，然后无耻地对风险视而不见。","“But you protest that you did it out of kindness, and because you wanted them to have a real good time. My good Alpha, it is absurd for a man to argue that he cut off a woman’s hands out of kindness. Human beings are so incredulous, so apt to think evil, that such arguments somehow fail to carry conviction. I am fairly credulous myself, but even I decline to accept the plea. And I say that if your conduct was meant kindly, it is a pity that you weren’t born cruel. Cruelty would have been better. Was it out of kindness that you refused to allow your youngest to acquire the skill to earn her own living? Was it out of kindness that you thwarted her instinct and filled her soul with regret that may be eternal? It was not. I have already indicated, in speaking of your son, one of the real reasons. Another was that you took pride in having these purely ornamental and loving creatures about you, and you would not suffer them to have an interest stronger than their interest in you, or a function other than the function of completing your career and illustrating your success in the world. If the girl was to play the piano, she was to play it in order to perfect your home and minister to your pleasure and your vanity, and for naught else. You got what you wanted, and you infamously shut your eyes to the risks."
"“我听到你抗议说，你没有对风险视而不见，因为风险总是存在，所以不可能完全预防它们。","“I hear you expostulate that you didn’t shut your eyes to the risks, and that there will always be risks, and that it is impossible to provide fully against all of them."
"“这话不错，或不算太错，但这样摆出事实只能是欲盖弥彰。哦，阿尔法！风险是生活不可避免的一部分，它们是生活的美好滋味和必要负担的一部分，没了危机感生活将平淡无味。但是你给你的妻女以错觉，将她们放到了一个没有风险的神奇世界。你故意将她们生活中最重要的因素——真正的责任——给剥夺了。你让她们在有正常价值观的人眼中显得荒谬可笑。你慢慢地剥夺了她们的自尊。如果你不是那么以自我为中心，她们可能会过得更开心，就算在你活着时也一样。如果你允许或促使妻子去体会财产的重任，去理解并分担你经营大笔生意的忧心，她会更加幸福。如果你的女儿们在几年里每天都能被强迫离开你设计的神奇世界，在现实生活中过几个小时，学习现实世界的地理、风俗、获得衣食和尊重的条件与能力，她们会更加幸福。你也会随之更加幸福，你这笨蛋！你让女儿们去豪华旅行，却不让她们来到真实的世界中。","“Which is true, or half true, and the truth or half-truth of the statement only renders your case the blacker, O Alpha! Risks are an inevitable part of life. They are part of the fine savour and burden of life, and without the sense of them life is flat and tasteless. And yet you feigned to your women that risk was eliminated from the magic world in which you had put them. You deliberately deprived them of the most valuable factor in existence—genuine responsibility. You made them ridiculous in the esteem of all persons with a just perception of values. You slowly bled them of their self-respect. Had you been less egotistic, they might have been happier, even during your lifetime. Your wife would have been happier had she been permitted or compelled to feel the weight of the estate and to share understanding the anxieties of your wonderful business. Your girls would have been happier had they been cast forcibly out of the magic world into the real world for a few hours everyday during a few years in order to learn its geography, and its customs, and the terms on which food and raiment and respect can be obtained in it, and the ability to obtain them. And so would you have been happier, fool! You sent your girls on the grand tour, but you didn’t send them into the real world."
"“阿尔法，砍掉别人手的人是坏蛋，砍掉女人手的人是恶棍。没人有理由这么做，根本没有。这样的人越好心就越是办坏事。我重申，你是最坏的那类恶棍。你的家人为你哀悼时，每人都说你是天使一样的父亲。但你仍然是个恶棍，每个家人的心里都知道，也承认，这着实让人沮丧。和你一样的人还有很多，阿尔法。对，甚至在英格兰就有成千上万和你一样的人……","“Alpha, the man who cuts off another man’s hands is a ruffian. The man who cuts off a woman’s hands is a scoundrel. There is no excuse for him—none whatever. And the kinder he is the worse he is. I repeat that you are the worst sort of scoundrel. Your family mourns you, and every member of it says what an angel of a father you were. But you were a scoundrel all the same. And at heart every member of the family knows it and admits it. Which is rather distressing. And there are thousands just like you, Alpha. Yes, even in England there are tens of thousands just like you..."
"“但你还没死。我只是让你想象一下你死了。","“But you aren’t dead yet. I was only asking you to conceive that you were."
"“相信我，亲爱的阿尔法。","“Believe me, my dear Alpha,"
"“爱你的”","“Yours affectionately.”"
"这可能是一封言辞激烈的长信。你问阿尔法收到信时情绪怎样，事实上，他根本没收到这封信。","A long and violent epistle perhaps. You inquire in what spirit Alphareceived it. The truth is, he never did receive it."
"四","4.0"
"你会很自然地以为在这封信到达之前，阿尔法已经因为中风、双侧肺炎、中弹、车祸或者诸如此类的不幸事件而倒下了。我预见到的那些可怕的事情也确实发生了，这就再次证明了我是一个多么明智的朋友，我哀悼时也有理由自我赞赏一番。但情况不是这样的。阿尔法没有倒下，他舒适宜人的房屋也没有坠入比喻中的悬崖。按照惩恶扬善的规则，他理应倒下，这是他活该，也可以给其他人一个警告——但他没有。不仅仅是坏人，那些没有远见、粗心大意的人也通常会像月桂树一样繁茂，而且会继续过得欣欣向荣，用最成功的方式挑战智慧和正义。这的确让贤哲人士和睿智的建议者生活得极其艰难且不愉快。","You naturally assume that before the letter could reach him Alpha had been mortally struck down by apoplexy, double pneumonia, bullet, automobile, or some such enemy of joy, and that all the dreadful things which I had foreseen might happen did in fact happen, thus proving once more what a very wise friend I was, and filling me with justifiable pride in my grief. But it was not so. Alpha was not struck down, nor did his agreeable house topple over the metaphorical precipice. According to poetical justice he ought to have been struck down, just to serve him right, and as a warning to others—only he was not. Not merely the wicked, but the improvident and the negligent, often flourish like the green bay tree, and they keep on flourishing, and setting wisdom and righteousness at defiance in the most successful manner. Which, indeed, makes the life of a philosopher and sagacious adviser extremely difficult and ungrateful."
"阿尔法没有收到信是因为我根本没把信寄出。有些信是为了倾吐而写，而不是为了寄出。这封信就是其中之一。发这样一封信并不合适。此外，不同于友谊带来的乐趣，友谊的职责决定了交谈是比写信更好、更勇敢也更稳妥的方式。当两位近在咫尺的友人要通过信件来解决一个严重分歧时，他们的友谊将岌岌可危；而且如果其中一人像我一样站在道德高处，那危险会更为严重。信件会越来越长，越来越无礼，而友谊留存下来的可能性也迅速变小。把没有勇气说出来的话用信表达出来通常是（尽管没那么绝对）一个很低劣的行径。","Alpha never received my letter because I never sent it. There are letters which one writes, not to send, but to ease one’s mind. This letter was one of them. It would not have been proper to dispatch such a letter. Moreover, in the duties of friendship, as distinguished from the pleasures of friendship, speech is better, bolder, surer than writing. When two friends within hailing distance of each other get to exchanging epistles in order to settle a serious difference of opinion, the peril to their friendship is indeed grave; and the peril is intensified when one of them has adopted a superior moral attitude—as I had. The letters grow longer and longer, ruder and ruder, and the probability of the friendship surviving grows ever rapidly less and less. It is—usually, though not always—a mean act to write what you have not the pluck to say."
"所以我只把信保留下来作为一个样本，说明我在坦诚的朋友这一重要角色中能做什么（如果我选择这么做）。","So I just kept the letter as a specimen of what I could do—if I chose—in the high role of candid friend."
"我告诉自己，一有愉快的场合，我就会暗示阿尔法先生如此这般，这样那样……","I said to myself that I would take the first favourable occasion to hint to Mr. Alpha how profoundly, etc., etc."
"这场合比我担心的时间来得要早。阿尔法先生病倒了，这场病尽管算不上吓人，但也足够严重了。一开始是大肠炎，后来转成盲肠炎，于是做了手术。阿尔法很快就下床了，心情也不错，不过我在俱乐部再次遇到他时他还有点虚弱。他坐在俱乐部里一扇巨大凸窗旁边的扶手椅上，兴致勃勃地观察着街上的各色景致。这幅场景几乎堪称完美。我在窗户另一端的扶手椅上坐下。从他无忧无虑的表情上我马上看出，疾病并没有带给他什么教训，于是我决定尽力用自己拙劣的谈话技巧与劝辞给他指明一个道理。","The occasion arrived sooner than I had feared. Alpha had an illness. It was not alarming, and yet it was sufficiently formidable. It began with colitis, and ended with appendicitis and an operation. Soon after Alphahad risen from his bed and was cheerfully but somewhat feebly about again I met him at a club. He was sitting in an arm-chair in one of the huge bay-windows of the club, and gazing with bright interest upon the varied spectacle of the street. The occasion was almost ideal. I took the other arm-chair in the semicircle of the window. I saw at once by his careless demeanour that his illness had taught him nothing, and I determined with all my notorious tact and persuasiveness to point amoral for him."
"正当我清清嗓子要开始时，他胳膊肘一扭，带着善意却讽刺的微笑大声说道：","And just as I was clearing my throat to begin he exclaimed, with a jerk of the elbow and a benevolently satiric smile:"
"“看见那女孩儿了吗？”","“See that girl?”"
"一个衣着朴素的女孩拿着小提琴盒穿过我们窗前的街道。","A plainly-dressed young woman carrying a violin case crossed the street in front of our window."
"“看见了，”我说，“她怎么了？”","“I see her,” said I. “What about her?”"
"“那是欧米加的二女儿。”","“That’s Omega’s second daughter.”"
"“哦，欧米加，”我低声说。“好久没见到他了，他在做什么呢？你近来见过他吗？”","“Oh, Omega,” I murmured. “Haven’t seen him for ages. What’s he doing with himself? Do you ever meet him nowadays?”"
"阿尔法说：","Said Mr. Alpha:"
"“我碰巧和他吃过一次饭，主要是为了生意，就在我生病的前几天。真是个相当奇怪的家伙，这个欧米加，相当奇怪。”","“I happened to dine with him—it was chiefly on business—a couple of days before I fell ill. Remarkably strange cove, Omega—remarkably strange.”"
"“为什么？怎么奇怪？这家伙的二女儿又怎么了？”","“Why? How? And what’s the matter with the cove’s second daughter, anyway?”"
"“这个，”阿尔法说，“他们都是一样的家伙——他，他二女儿和他其余的家人。很有意思，你应该会对这件事感兴趣，欧米加有种疯病。”","“Well,” said Alpha, “it’s all of a piece—him and his second daughter and the rest of the family. Funny case. It ought to interest you. Omega’s got a mania.”"
"“什么疯病？”","“What mania?”"
"“不太好说，可以叫做未雨绸缪疯病。”","“Not too easy to describe. Call it the precaution mania.”"
"“未雨绸缪疯病？什么东西？”","“The precaution mania? What’s that?”"
"“我来告诉你。”","“I’ll tell you.”"
"他随之告诉了我。","And he told me."
"五","5.0"
"“很奇怪，”阿尔法说，“我得盲肠炎的时候本应该在欧米加家。欧米加对盲肠炎很在行。”","“Odd thing,” said Alpha, “that I should have been at Omega’s just as I was sickening for appendicitis. He’s great on appendicitis, is Omega.”"
"“他得过吗？”","“Has he had it?”"
"“没有！他什么病都没得过。不过他告诉我，去年去墨西哥之前他就事先把盲肠割掉了，以防在墨西哥某个蛮荒的地方犯了急性盲肠炎而又找不到能做手术的医生。他总是这样，你知道的。我相信要是按他的意思来，全家没有一个人的盲肠能剩下。他接种了所有疫苗，全家人都接种了。他家里还有个精致的医药箱，还配有他从医生那里硬要来的、打印好的详细说明——怕万一有什么突发事件。欧米加只需要读读这些说明，他就可以缝合严重的伤口，接好断了的动脉，注射吗啡和盐水。他家的每个房间里都有体温计，连每个浴室都有。每扇门窗都装有防盗报警系统，每一层都装有灭火器。这还不算什么。你该听听他的保险。当然了，他自己和全家人都上了人身保险，还上了铁路事故险和其他各种事故险，以及疾病保险。他为全体员工的忠诚上了保险，当然还有盗窃保险和火灾险，因火灾损失的租金也上了保险。他的厚玻璃上了保险，一串钥匙也上了保险。还有雇主责任险、战争险、商业损失险、有价证券利息险。他寒酸的小汽车也上了保险。我甚至相信他曾为生双胞胎的几率也上了保险。”","“Not he! He’s never had anything. But he informed me that before he went to Mexico last year he took the precaution of having his appendix removed, lest he might have acute appendicitis in some wild part of the country where there might be no doctor just handy for an operation. He’s like that, you know. I believe if he had his way there wouldn’t be an appendix left in the entire family. He’s inoculated against everything. They’re all inoculated against everything. And he keeps an elaborate medicine-chest in his house, together with elaborate typewritten instructions which he forced his doctor to give him—in case anything awful should happen suddenly. Omega has only to read those instructions, and he could stitch a horrible wound, tie up a severed artery, or make an injection of morphia or salt water. He has a thermometer in every room and one in each bath. Also burglar-alarms at all doors and windows, and fire extinguishers on every floor. But that’s nothing. You should hear about his insurance. Of course, he’s insured his life and the lives of the whole family of them. He’s insured against railway accidents and all other accidents, and against illness. The fidelity of all his clerks is insured. He’s insured against burglary, naturally. Against fire, too. And against loss of rent through fire. His plate-glass is insured. His bunch of keys is insured. He’s insured against employers’ liability. He’s insured against war. He’s insured against loss of business profits. The interest on his mortgage securities is insured. His wretched little automobile is insured. I do believe he was once insured against the eventuality of twins.”"
"“那他一定感到很安心。”我说。","“He must feel safe,” I said."
"“一点都没有。”阿尔法回答，“生活对他而言绝对是个负担。如果他没把这个变成全家所有人的负担也倒还好。他们都要为最坏的情况做准备。如果他死了，他妻子会知道该怎么做。她清楚地知道丈夫财政情况的所有细节。她别无选择，因为丈夫监督她这么做，每天都告诉她最新进展。而且她每天要给丈夫出示家庭支出的明细，就好像持家是一项生意，因为丈夫害怕她孤立无援时不知道怎么办。她不得不理解生活很现实，不是儿戏，死亡就更不要说了。","“Not the least bit in the world,” replied Alpha. “Life is a perfect burden to him. That wouldn’t matter so much if he didn’t make it a perfect burden to all his family as well. They’ve all got to be prepared against the worst happening. If he fell down dead his wife would know just what to do. She knows all the details of his financial position exactly. She has to; he sees to that. He keeps her up to date in them every day. And she has to show him detailed accounts of the house as though it was a business undertaking, because he’s so afraid of her being left helpless and incapable. She just has to understand that life is real, life is earnest, and death more so."
"“还有孩子们，他们当然都上了保险。每个女孩都要轮流持家，而且都要自力更生——以防爸爸突然死掉。拿二女儿来说，她不喜欢音乐，但对小提琴还算上手，所以必须把这种技能转化成金钱，以防万一。她天生喜欢漂亮的衣服和懒散的生活，还喜欢承担责任。如果父亲允许，她一定很高兴承担这个风险。但父亲不允许，所以她很痛苦。我猜他们全部都很痛苦。","“Then the children. They’re all insured, of course. Each of the girls has to take charge of the house in turn. And they must all earn their own living—in case papa fell down dead. Take that second daughter. She hates music, but she has a certain mechanical facility with the fiddle, and so she must turn it into coin, in order to be on the safe side. Her instincts are for fine clothes, idleness, and responsibility. She’d take the risks cheerfully enough if he’d let her. But he won’t. So she’s miserable. I think they all are more or less.”"
"“不过，”我提出，“感受生活的重担对人格不是什么坏事。”","“But still,” I put in, “to feel the burden of life is not a bad thing for people’s characters.”"
"“也许吧。”阿尔法说，“但让人在一堆负担下垮掉也不会有太大好处，不是吗？唉，欧米加是个有钱人，你知道吗，他只能花掉收入的三分之一。理由就是那老一套，他可能会突然死掉——保险公司也不是圣贤——而且无论如何，也要为晚年做好充分准备。还有，他所有的证券可能同时下跌。最后，他说，你永远也不知道会发生什么，哈！”","“Perhaps not,” said Alpha. “But to be crushed under a cartload of bricks isn’t likely to do one much good, is it? Why, Omega’s a wealthy man, and d’you know, he must live on about a third of his income. The argument is, as usual, that he’s liable to fall down dead—and insurance companies are only human—and anyhow, old age must be amply provided for. And then all his securities might fall simultaneously. And lastly, as he says, you never know what may happen. Ugh!”"
"“迄今为止发生过什么事吗？”","“Has anything happened up to now?”"
"“是的，一次可怕的灾难。六年前他家客厅炉前的地毯着火，整个给烧毁了。保险公司赔给他两镑，他为此狂喜了三个星期。从那以后欧米加没发生过更糟的事儿。他的生意是全国最稳定的之一。他简直就像鳄鱼和鹦鹉一样聪明。","“Oh, yes. An appalling disaster. His drawing-room hearthrug caught fire six years ago and was utterly ruined. He got two pounds out of the insurance company for that, and was ecstatically delighted about it for three weeks. Nothing worse ever will happen to Omega. His business is one of the safest in the country. His constitution is that of a crocodile or a parrot. And he’s as cute as they make ’em.”"
"“我想你不会嫉妒他的。”","“And I suppose you don’t envy him?”"
"“是的。”阿尔法说。","“I don’t,” said Alpha."
"“那么，”我冒险说，“我来给你提个建议。绝对不要和欧米加同乘一趟火车。”","“Well,” I ventured, “let me offer you a piece of advice. Never travel in the same train with Mr. Omega.”"
"“绝对不和他同乘一趟火车？为什么？”","“Never travel in the same train with him? Why not?”"
"“如果火车出了事故，你们俩都当场死亡，以后你的家庭和他的家庭会被拿来比较，看这件事对两个家庭带来的影响，而你的家庭不会喜欢这样。”","“Because if there were a railway accident, and you were both killed on the spot, the world might draw comparisons between the effect on your family and the effect on his, and your family wouldn’t like it.”"
"我们有好一阵没说话，而这阵沉默很戏剧化。我紧张地望着窗外。","We remained silent for a space, and the silence was dramatic. Nervously, I looked out of the window."
"最后阿尔法说：","At length Alpha said:"
"“我想应该有个折衷的办法。”","“I suppose there is such a thing as the happy medium.”"
"“再见，阿尔法。”我突然起身。“对不起，但我需要马上离开。”","“Goodbye, Alpha.” I rose abruptly. “Sorry, but I’ve got to go at once.”"
"然后我明智地离开了。","And I judiciously departed."
"1 摩西击打磐石出水，典故出自《圣经•出埃及记》。记载的是以色列人出埃及过红海以后，在旷野没有水喝，就发怨言，与摩西争闹。上帝吩咐摩西击打磐石。磐石破裂，涌出水来，人和牲畜都喝足了。",""
"第四章 处于她的位置上","CHAPTER IV In Her Place"
"一","1.0"
"平凡人不总是成熟和成功的，尽管我一直都认为他是。他也许在世俗的眼中不算成功，但依我现在的角度来看，我并不关心他是否在此意义上是成功的。我知道平凡人很少失败，正是平凡让他们免于陷入可悲的失败所带来的令人惶恐的境况。另一方面，我很关心平凡人是否成熟，是年老还是年轻。我想找到年轻的平凡人，但这很难做到。事实上，就像平凡人很少失败一样，平凡人也很少是年轻的。只有历经岁月，他才变得平凡。年轻时，即使已经三十多岁，他还有反复无常的特质，这让他无法被归为明智而普通的平凡人。然后他慢慢地丢失了这些容易招致麻烦的特质，成长为国家的中流砥柱。那时如果告诉他，就因为他忘记培养所有品质中最重要的一条——即想象力，所以他不够完美，已然为时过晚。因为想象力需要在早期培养，它正是这些可敬的平凡人所缺少的品质。","The plain man is not always mature and successful, as I have hitherto regarded him. He may be unsuccessful in a worldly sense; but from my present point of view I do not much care whether he is unsuccessful in that sense. I know that plain men are seldom failures; their very plainness saves them from the alarming picturesqueness of the abject failure. On the other hand, I care greatly whether the plain man is mature or immature, old or young. I should prefer to catch him young. But he is difficult to catch young. The fact is that, just as he is seldom a failure, so he is seldom young. He becomes plain only with years. In youth, even in the thirties, he has fanciful capricious qualities which prevent him from being classed with the average sagacious plain man. He slowly loses these inconvenient qualities, and develops into part of the backbone of the nation. And then it is too late to tell him that he is not perfect, simply because he has forgotten to cultivate the master quality of all qualities—namely, imagination. For imagination must be cultivated early, and it is just the quality that these admirable plain men lack."
"说到想象力，我指的是假想自己处于并非实际境地的能力，比如说，设想自己处在另一个人的位置上。这是命运的讽刺幽默之一：想象力，对于不理智的头脑异常危险，而对于理智的头脑非常可贵，但它往往为前者而并非后者所有。而且这一品质在盎格鲁—撒克逊种族中极为罕见，他们既害怕它又以它为耻。","By imagination I mean the power to conceive oneself in a situation which one is not actually in; for instance, in another person’s place. It is among the sardonic humours of destiny that imagination, while positively dangerous in an ill-balanced mind and of the highest valuein a well-balanced mind, is to be found rather in the former than in the latter. And anyhow, the quality is rare in Anglo-Saxon races, which are indeed both afraid and ashamed of it."
"但是如果平凡人——头脑理智的盎格鲁—撒克逊男性，能够拥有它，那么我们该生活在一个多么不平凡的世界里啊！世界上最重要的事情就会发生变化。世界上最重要的事情，归根结底还是婚姻生活，而想象力这一品质主要的实际用途就是改善婚姻生活。但在英格兰或美国（或者其他地方）有谁会把这两者联系起来呢？平凡人认为只有诗人和小说家才用得上想象力。傻瓜！是的，尽管我对平凡人甚为尊重，还是要用最常用的词语来骂他，傻瓜！想象力对他本人极为重要，毫无疑问这是上天创造出来给平凡人主要用在平凡而辛苦的日常婚姻生活中的。如果他愿意运用想像力，好日子就会到来，尽管会有点慢。","And yet could the plain, the well-balanced Anglo-Saxon male acquire it, what a grand world we should live in! The most important thing in the world would be transformed. The most important thing in the world is, ultimately, married life, and the chief practical use of the quality of imagination is to ameliorate married life. But who in England or America (or elsewhere) thinks of it in that connection? The plain man considers that imagination is all very well for poets and novelists. Blockhead! Yes, despite my high esteem for him, I will apply to him the Johnsonian term of abuse. Blockhead! Imagination is super-eminently for himself, and was beyond doubt invented by Providence in order that the plain man might chiefly exercise it in the plain, drudging dailiness of married life. The day cometh, if tardily, when he will do so."

"这些念头是我在仔细思量认识的一位欧米克隆先生的近况时浮现在脑海中的，是研究他这个有趣案例的初步成果。不到一周前，欧米克隆先生和太太两人坐在家里的客厅里，这是欧米克隆家一个普通的夜晚。欧米克隆三十二岁，既说不上成功，也不算不成功，即使再敏锐的人也不好说二十年后他会成功还是失败。但人人都看得出来，他已经开始变为一个头脑理智的平凡人。他正在失去那些反复无常的特质，安心地成为国家呆板的骨干力量，比通常情况稍早一些。","These reflections have surged up in my brain as I contemplate the recent case of my acquaintance, Mr. Omicron, and they are preliminary to a study of that interesting case. Scarce a week ago Omicron was sitting in the Omicron drawing-room alone with Mrs. Omicron. It was an average Omicron evening. Omicron is aged thirty-two. He is neither successful nor unsuccessful, and no human perspicacity can say whether twenty years hence he will be successful or unsuccessful. But anybody can see that he is already on the way to be a plain, well-balanced man. Somewhat earlier than usual he is losing the fanciful capricious qualities and settling down into the stiff backbone of the nation."
"两人交谈不多。","Conversation was not abundant."
"欧米克隆太太突然用逢迎、讨好的语气说：","Said Mrs. Omicron suddenly, with an ingratiating accent:"
"“我要的那枚戒指怎么办呢？”","“What about that ring that I was to have?”"
"欧米克隆沉默了片刻，在这片刻中，这个男人身上的每块肌肉，特别是脸部肌肉，还有精神上的每条隐秘纤维，都明显绷紧了。然后欧米克隆先生带着反驳、责难、急躁的语气，简短且生硬地用这样一句话结束了交谈：","There was a pause, in which every muscle of the man’s body, and especially the facial muscles, and every secret fibre of his soul, perceptibly stiffened. And then Omicron answered, curtly, rebuttingly, reprovingly, snappishly, finishingly:"
"“我不知道。”","“I don’t know.”"
"然后他拿起了报纸，报纸犹如一面簌簌作响的脆弱墙壁，又像是一堵十二英寸厚的钢板，把每一点可能落到他身上的指责都挡了回去。","And took up his newspaper, whose fragile crackling wall defended him from attack every bit as well as a screen of twelve-inch armour-plating. "
"这个话题就此打住了。","The subject was dropped."
"谈话只持续了十秒钟，但这十秒钟标记了欧米克隆先生作为丈夫的一个时代，可他并不知道。他不知道自己婚姻生活的前景在这十秒钟里还是平衡的，然后就稍微有点倾斜了，当然是朝错误的方向倾斜。","It had endured about ten seconds. But those ten seconds marked an epoch in Omicron’s career as a husband—and he knew it not. He knew it not, but the whole of his conjugal future had hung evenly in the balance during those ten seconds, and then slid slightly but definitely—to the wrong side."
"当然了，事情并不是表面看上去那么简单。晚餐时，看上去很鲜美的羊腿，切开后才发现明显半生不熟。这真是太丢人了，一等的羊腿就这样因为糟糕的厨艺浪费了；要是条三等的羊腿，那罪孽还可能小一些。而且就在四天前，另一道好菜也同样因为厨艺不精，或因为漫不经心，或随便列出的什么理由，做得不适合给男人们吃。这还不是全部。咖啡煮得很稀，口味很淡，索然无味。而女人们在面对最后这个恶魔般的罪恶行为时辩解说，最后一刻才发现厨房里咖啡不够了。这完全正常！但正是这种寻常事件造就了牺牲品，而欧米克隆已经因此成了牺牲品。他，如果没有其他人的话，完全认识到那个晚上自己就是个牺牲品。而女人居然挑选了这个晚上来提出关于戒指这类俗气又无用的饰品问题！他没说什么。但他已经能代表广大丈夫的立场，在欧米克隆太太身上他看到了广大妻子的形象。","Of course, there was more in the affair than appeared on the surface. At dinner the otherwise excellent leg of mutton had proved on cutting to be most noticeably underdone. Now, it is a monstrous shame that first-class mutton should be wasted through inefficient cookery; with third-class mutton the crime might have been deemed less awful. Moreover, four days previously another excellent dish had been rendered unfit for masculine consumption by precisely the same inefficiency or gross negligence, or whatever one likes to call it. Nor was that all. The coffee had been thin, feeble, uninteresting. The feminine excuse for this last diabolic iniquity had been that the kitchen at the last moment had discovered itself to be short of coffee. An entirely commonplace episode! Yes, but it is out of commonplace episodes that martyrs are made, and Omicron had been made a martyr. He, if none else, was fully aware that evening that he was a martyr. And the woman had selected just that evening to raise the question of rings, gauds, futile ornamentations! He had said little. But he had stood for the universal husband, and in Mrs. Omicron he saw the universal wife."
"三","3.0"
"他心里是这样想的：","His reflections ran somewhat thus:"
"“保证家里有足够的咖啡绝对是件简单的事儿！小女孩都能做到！而她们居然可以让咖啡不够！我的要求一点都不过分。我对家庭生活没什么特殊要求。但我的确喜欢好咖啡，结果居然喝不到！太奇怪了！说到羊腿，别人会以为厨房里没有钟表呢，还以为这里以前没有人做过羊腿呢。她们这一生里煮过多少只羊腿了？几十只，上百只，我敢说有上千只呢。结果她们还是不明白某种大小的羊腿需要一定的时间才能做熟，如果烤得晚了，只会有两种结果——要么就是做不熟，要么就是晚餐推迟！太简单了！完全合乎逻辑！家里的四个女人（三个女仆和坏心眼且粗心大意的欧米克隆太太），居然能因为疏忽大意就把羊腿给浪费了！以前并不是没有发生过这种事！我也不是没有提出过！但女人就是半吊子。所有的女人都一样。家也给管得半吊子了。她（欧米克隆太太，这个罪魁祸首）在这个世界上除了持家什么都不需要做——可看看她干成什么样了！没有条理！没有方法！她学过科学持家没有啊？根本没有！她在乎吗？不在乎！如果她真的有点责任感，要是她稍微意识到自己的缺点，她根本不会开口问戒指的问题。但结果呢！她只想着花钱，打扮自己。我希望她得去自己挣点钱，能学点东西。她会知道生活不止是月亮宝石和汽车。戒指，真是的！她的没眼色惹恼了我。我是个受虐待的丈夫，所有丈夫都受到了不公正对待。整个体系都需要改变。不过，我必须精神饱满地来对付。我会精神饱满地来应付的。戒指，真是的！没眼色！”","“Surely a simple matter to keep enough coffee in the house! A schoolgirl could do it! And yet they let themselves run short of coffee! I ask for nothing out of the way. I make no inordinate demands on the household. But I do like good coffee. And I can’t have it! Strange! As for that mutton—one would think there was no clock in the kitchen. One would think that nobody had ever cooked a leg of mutton before. How many legs of mutton have they cooked between them in their lives? Scores; hundreds; I daresay thousands. And yet it hasn’t yet dawned on them that a leg of mutton of a certain weight requires a certain time for cooking, and that if it is putdown late one of two things must occur—either it will be undercooked or the dinner will be late! Simple enough! Logical enough! Four women in the house (three servants and the wicked, negligent Mrs. Omicron), and yet must needs waste a leg of mutton through nothing but gross carelessness! It isn’t as if it hadn’t happened before! It isn’t as if I hadn’t pointed it out! But women are amateurs. All women are alike. All housekeeping is amateurish. She (Mrs. Omicron, the criminal) has nothing in this world to do but run the house—and see how she runs it! No order! No method! Has she ever studied housekeeping scientifically? Not she! Does she care? Not she! If she had any real sense of responsibility, if she had the slightest glimmering of her own shortcomings, she wouldn’t have started on the ring question. But there you are! She only thinks of spending, and titivating herself. I wish she had to do a little earning. She’d find out a thing or two then. She’d find out that life isn’t all moonstones and motorcars. Ring, indeed! It’s the lack of tact that annoys me. I am an ill-used man. All husbands are ill-used men. The whole system wants altering. However, I must keep my end up. And I will keep my end up. Ring, indeed! No tact!”"
"他的怒气在心里暗暗地累积，而且他很享受这个积累怒气的过程。他的想法里有夸张的地方，第二天他会承认那些话可能说得太过绝对，但他会坚持那些话本质上是对的。他没有真的对欧米克隆太太怒不可遏；事实上也没有真的把她跟造假者和醉酒的司机归为一类；说真的，这家伙在以自己的方式爱着她。但他的确给了妻子一个成熟的评价。他把怨气用棉絮裹好放在抽屉里，恶作剧般地不时拿出来品味一番。他的确在积累那种毒液，千分之九百九十九个婚姻的社会健康受这种毒液影响——不管这些婚姻有多愉快。他巩固了这种有害的思维习惯。一开始是一点，后来是双倍的，最后他终于破坏了婚姻的幸福——因为一定不要忘记，在给自己创造不快的同时，他也给妻子带来了不快。他最终强化了两性之间普遍存在的互不理解。","He fostered a secret fury. And he enjoyed fostering it. There was exaggeration in these thoughts, which, he would admit next day, were possibly too sweeping in their scope. But he would maintain the essential truth of them. He was not really and effectively furious against Mrs. Omicron; he did not, as a fact, class her with forgers and drunken chauffeurs; indeed, the fellow loved her in his fashion. But he did pass a mature judgment against her. He did wrap up his grudge in cotton-wool and put it in a drawer and examine it with perverse pleasure now and then. He did increase that secretion of poison which weakens the social health of nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thousand married lives—however delightful they may be. He did render more permanent a noxious habit of mind. He did appreciably and doubly and finally impair the conjugal happiness—for it must not be forgotten that in creating a grievance for himself he also gave his wife a grievance. He did, in fine, contribute to the general mass of misunderstanding between sex and sex."
"如果欧米克隆先生正在读这本书，他一定在读，那么他会站起来大叫：","If he is reading this, as he assuredly is, Mr. Omicron will up and exclaim:"
"“带给我妻子不快！荒谬！事实是无可争议的。她能有什么不快？”","“My wife a grievance! Absurd! The facts are incontrovertible. What grievance can she have?”"
"欧米克隆先生正在日趋向平凡人转化，他的不幸在于没有在该用上想象力的地方运用想象力。","The grievance that Mr. Omicron, becoming every day more and more the plain man, is not exercising imagination in the very field where it is most needed."
"什么是家庭，欧米克隆先生？你回答说家庭就是家庭。你一直都有家庭，自己就出生于一个家庭，如果运气不错临终时也会有一个。你从未把家庭看做是家庭之外的什么东西，你脑子里的主要想法就是家庭断然不是公司，也不是工厂。但假设你不用眼睛——就是说用你的想象力——试着去看一下家庭呢？它不但是一个家庭，还是一家公司、一个工厂，因为它给一定的人群提供光、热、清洁、安逸和食物。假设你可以这么想，家庭的确是一个和公司、工厂相似的组织呢？——而且它是一个极端复杂和精巧的组织，有很多不同的部门，在极端困难的情况下运转。这就是真相。如果你能有一次这样的想象，就再也不会用那种轻蔑的语气说：“欧米克隆太太在这个世界上除了持家什么都不需要做。”因为欧米克隆太太也可以聪明地说：“欧米克隆先生在这个世界上除了经营公司之外什么都不需要做。”","What is a home, Mr. Omicron? You reply that a home is a home. You have always had a home. You were born in one. With luck you will die in one. And you have never regarded a home as anything but a home. Your leading idea has ever been that a home is emphatically not an office nor a manufactory. But suppose you were to unscale your eyes—that is to say, use your imagination—try to see that a home, in addition to being a home, is an office and manufactory for the supply of light, warmth, cleanliness, ease, and food to a given number of people? Suppose you were to allow it to occur to you that a home emphatically is an organization similar to an office and manufactory—and an extremely complicated and delicate one, with many diverse departments, functioning under extremely difficult conditions? For thus it in truth is. Could you once accomplish this feat of imaginative faculty, you would never again say, with that disdainful accent of yours: “Mrs. Omicron has nothing in the world to do but run the house.” For really it would be just as clever for her to say: “Mr. Omicron has nothing in the world to do but run the office.”"
"我从心底承认欧米克隆太太不是完人。她当然理应是个完人，不过啊，她辜负了这个理想。但在一些细节上她能够，也的确，给她丈夫这位天使长指明道路。当她的公司和工厂出错时，你，欧米克隆先生，自然而然地要生气，感到高人一等。你居高临下地琢磨，家里有四个女人这样那样。但当你回家后抱怨你男子汉的事业有点问题，抱怨一个经济阶段会到来，她有没有对你嗤之以鼻地说：“今晚别提咖啡的事儿了。我真是好奇，你单位有十四个（或一百四十个）成年男子，却不能保证足够而规律的收益？”没有，她做得很好，表示理解。而你，欧米克隆先生，如果她没有表示理解，你一定会非常吃惊和难过。用用你的想象力，就会明白这些对比多么有趣。","I admit heartily that Mrs. Omicron is not perfect. She ought to be, of course; but she, alas! falls short of the ideal. Yet in some details she can and does show the way to that archangel, her husband. When her office and manufactory goes wrong, you, Mr. Omicron, are righteously indignant and superior. You majestically wonder that with four women in the house, etc., etc. But when you come home and complain that things are askew in your masculine establishment, and that a period of economy must set in, does she say to you with scorn: “Don’t dare to mention coffee tonight. I really wonder that with fourteen (or a hundred and forty) grown men in your establishment you cannot produce an ample and regular income?” No; she makes the best of it. She is sympathetic. And you, Mr. Omicron, would be excessively startled and wounded if she were not sympathetic. Put your imagination to work and you will see how interesting are these comparisons."
"四","4.0"
"你说她在自己的领域里是个半吊子，也许吧。但是谁让她成了半吊子呢？你难道不是对保持古老的传统很满意吗？经常沉思的你，当你对着睡在婴儿床里的小女儿沉思时，你想的是教给她科学的持家之道，还是让她学习音乐、外语和优雅仪态而变得有魅力？你心里是愿意看见她在肉铺精明地挑牛肉，还是在客厅里熠熠生辉让你开心呢？","She is an amateur at her business, you say. Well, perhaps she is. But who brought her up to be an amateur? Are you not content to carry on the ancient tradition? As you meditate, and you often do meditate, upon that infant daughter of yours now sleeping in her cot, do you dream of giving her a scientific education in housekeeping, or do you dream of endowing her with the charms that music and foreign languages and physical grace can offer? Do you in your mind’s eye see her cannily choosing beef at the butcher’s, or shining for your pleasure in the drawing-room?"
"而且，欧米克隆太太也许不像你想的那样是个半吊子。人们总是熟能生巧。人性中难道有什么理由决定了像家庭这样复杂的机器一定比公司或工厂发生的事故少吗？再运用一下你的想象力，把你办公室里发生的多种多样的小灾难转嫁到家里。诚实一些，承认所谓普通办公室的高效率只是个传说吧。在办公室里发生的错误、疏忽或遗忘在得到弥补后就被丢在脑后了。欧米克隆太太——我亲爱的欧米克隆先生——从未听到过一点。但在欧米克隆太太的办公室，事情可不是这样的，被唤醒的想象力会告诉你。欧米克隆太太的客厅女仆没有掸去大厅桌子上的一点灰尘。欧米克隆先生走了进来，他像上帝一样的眼光立刻落在有灰的地方，马上就讽刺地大叫起来：“哈！家里有四个女人，却不能保证客厅桌子的整洁！”","And then Mrs. Omicron is, perhaps, not so much of an amateur as you assume. People learn by practice. Is there any reason in human nature why a complex machine such as a house may be worked with fewer breakdowns than an office or manufactory? Harness your imagination once more and transfer to your house the multitudinous minor catastrophes that happen in your office. Be sincere, and admit that the efficiency of the average office is naught but a pretty legend. A mistake or negligence or forgetfulness in an office is remedied and forgotten. Mrs. Omicron—my dear Mr. Omicron—never hears of it. Not so with Mrs. Omicron’s office, as your aroused imagination will tell you. Mrs. Omicron’s parlourmaid’s duster fails to make contact with one small portion of the hall-table. Mr.Omicron walks in, and his godlike glance drops instantly on the dusty place, and Mr. Omicron ejaculates sardonically: “H’m! Four women in the house, and they can’t even keep the hall-table respectable!”"
"欧米克隆先生把一封信忘在了未回信件篓子的底部，一星期后一封激动的电报从海外发了过来，然后需要回一封电报。没什么真正的损失。两镑的电报就解决了问题。而欧米克隆太太，一心念着前面提到的欧米克隆小姐脖子后面的疹子，从镇上回来时忘记订羊肉了。那天下午，她一意识到自己可怕的错误就马上奔向了电话。肉铺老板让她不用担心，保证说她要的羊腿会送来。但你看到那个和同伴在街角玩耍的伙计了吗？他带着那条羊腿，也把握着欧米克隆太太的声誉和幸福，尽管他自己并不知道也不在意。他迟到了。欧米克隆先生你自己就说过，如果羊腿烤得晚了，只会有两种结果——要不就是做不熟，要不就是推迟晚餐。","Mr. Omicron forgets a letter at the bottom of his unanswered-letter basket, and a week later an excited cable arrives from overseas, and that cable demands another cable. No real harm has been done. Two pounds spent on cables have cured the ill. Mrs. Omicron, preoccupied with a rash on the back of the neck of Miss Omicron before-mentioned, actually comes back from town without having ordered the mutton. In the afternoon she realizes her horrid sin and rushes to the telephone. The butcher reassures her. He swears the desired leg shall arrive. But do you see that boy dallying at the street corner with his mate? He carries the leg of mutton, and he carries also, though he knows it not nor cares, the reputation and happiness of Mrs. Omicron. He is late. As you yourself remarked, Mr. Omicron, if a leg of mutton is put down late to roast, one of two things must occur—either it will be undercooked or the dinner will be late."
"现在如果持家也像办公一样简单，欧米克隆太太面对意外事故会平静地笑着对自己说：“没关系，我会付滞纳金的——这样我还能有四十分钟的时间。”欧米克隆先生，当你因花三小时吃午饭而推迟口授信件时，就会这么说。只是欧米克隆太太的世界里没有滞纳金。如果欧米克隆太太在你回家时扔给你两便士，告诉你晚餐会晚四十分钟，这是她交的钱，那么，欧米克隆先生，你会怎么想呢？","Now, if housekeeping was as simple as office-keeping, Mrs. Omicron would smile in tranquillity at the contretemps, and say to herself: “Never mind, I shall pay the late-posting fee—that will give me an extra forty minutes.” You say that, Mr. Omicron, about your letters, when you happen to have taken three hours for lunch and your dictation of correspondence is thereby postponed. Only there is no late-posting fee in Mrs. Omicron’s world. If Mrs. Omicron flung two pence at you when you came home, and informed you that dinner would be forty minutes late and that she was paying the fee, what, Mr. Omicron, would be your state of mind?"
"现在你的想象力已经很敏锐了，欧米克隆先生，它将带着你进一步看看欧米克隆太太在管理她的公司或工厂时遇到的更可怕的困难。她的员工没受过教育，甚至比你的员工的受教育程度更低。而且她员工的心态一般都有某种特别奇怪之处。比如说，她的员工绝对不会走过来对她说：“太太，咖啡只够两天的量了。”不！她的员工只会平静地等四十八小时，然后在晚上七点过来说：“太太，咖啡不够了。”还有更糟的！欧米克隆先生，你可以严厉地对一名职员说：“听着，如果再发生这样的事儿，我就把你扔到街上去。”你和他都知道，有一百个职员在等着取代他的位置。可另一方面，有一百个主妇在等着雇佣欧米克隆太太的厨子。欧米克隆太太只能尽力而为，她必须柔声细语地强调规矩，因为家仆供不应求。还有更糟糕的呢。最糟糕的，也是欧米克隆太太所要承受的最不利的条件就是，她的大部分错误、疏忽和罪行都会直接影响一个男人的胃，而这个男人是个饥饿的男人。","And your imagination, now very alert, will carry you even farther than this, Mr. Omicron, and disclose to you still more fearful difficulties which Mrs. Omicron has to face in the management of her office or manufactory. Her staff is uneducated, less educated even than yours. And her staff is universally characterized by certain peculiarities of mentality. For example, her staff will never, never, never, come and say to her: “Please, ma’am, there is only enough coffee left for two days.” No! Her staff will placidly wait forty-eight hours, and then come at 7 p.m. and say: “Please, ma’am, there isn’t enough coffee” And worse! You, Mr. Omicron, can say roundly to a clerk: “Look here, if this occurs again I shall fling you into the street.” You are aware, and he is aware, that a hundred clerks are waiting to take his place. On the other hand, a hundred mistresses are waiting to take the place of Mrs. Omicron with regard to her cook. Mrs. Omicron has to do as best she can. She has to speak softly and to temper discipline, because the supply of domestic servants is unequal to the demand. And there is still worse. The worst of all, the supreme disadvantage under which Mrs. Omicron suffers, is that most of her errors, lapses, crimes, directly affect a man in the stomach, and the man is a hungry man."
"现在你完全活跃的想象力，欧米克隆先生，向你展示了你妻子俗世的命运并不是你以为的那样，只坐在天鹅绒沙发里，而且你过一万年也不会和她互换位置。对她作为凡人的有限能力，你的态度改善了，两性之间一大堆的误解也趋于缓和了。","Mr. Omicron, your imagination, now feverishly active, will thus demonstrate to you that your wife’s earthly lot is not the velvet couch that you had unimaginatively assumed it to be, and that, indeed, you would not change places with her for a hundred thousand a year. Your attitude towards her human limitations will be modified, and the general mass of misunderstanding between sex and sex will tend to diminish."
"（如果你的态度仍还没有改善，那就让想象力多停留一下。想想你知道的数目众多的服务差且价钱昂贵的旅馆——管理这些旅馆的不是半吊子的女人，而是专业的男人。还有你自己俱乐部的食品部门那顽固不化的混乱管理——那可是你一直都在向内务委员会的成员抱怨的。）","(And if even yet your attitude is not modified, let your imagination dwell for a few instants on the extraordinary number of bad and expensive hotels with which you are acquainted—managed, not by amateurish women, but by professional men. And on the obstinate mismanagement of the commissariat of your own club—of which you are continually complaining to members of the house-committee.)"

"在羊腿没做熟和咖啡不够这样可怕的失败后，欧米克隆太太还是不合时宜地问丈夫戒指的事儿，让欧米克隆先生有了一些想法。我现在要讨论这些想法中的另一方面了。“她只想着花钱，”欧米克隆先生愤恨地想。这想法毫无疑问有点道理，但如果欧米克隆先生好好用脑子想想，就会发现还有另一层意思。假设你不用眼睛，欧米克隆先生——就是说用你的想象力——设法去想一想金钱问题，你妻子人生中主要的、固有的任务就是花钱。想想如果有天早上她这么说你会怎么想：“亨利，我对花钱感到厌恶了，我要出去挣钱。”难道你不会提到“女人的领域”这个经典说法吗？简单说来，会有一场口角和吵闹。","I pass to another aspect of Mr. Omicron’s private reflections consequent upon Mrs. Omicron’s dreadful failure of tact in asking him about the ring after the mutton had proved to be underdone and the coffee to be inadequate. “She only thinks of spending,” reflected Mr. Omicron, resentfully. A more or less true reflection, no doubt, but there would have been a different colour to it if Mr. Omicron had exercised the greatest of his faculties. Suppose you were to unscale your eyes, Mr. Omicron—that is to say, use your imagination—and try to see that so far as finance is concerned your wife’s chief and proper occupation in life is to spend. Conceive what you would say if she announced one morning: “Henry, I am sick of spending. I am going out into the world to earn.” Can you not hear yourself employing a classic phrase about “the woman’s sphere”? In brief, there would occur an altercation and a shindy."
"想象力一旦开动，就会告诉你婚姻生活分为两大部门——挣钱部门和花钱部门。华兹华斯说过：在得到与花费间，我们耗尽了毕生精力。这是最让人满意的耗费精力的办法。这两个部门互不可缺，还互相平衡。是你将这两个部门组织起来，并安排自己和妻子各自成为一个部门的负责人。你当然也可以不这么组织安排。大可以按照霍屯督人的方式来决定让妻子去挣钱，你来负责花钱。但由于某种神秘的原因你不喜欢这种安排，所以你还是每天去上班，并把钱带回家。决定你每天行动的原理牢牢地建立在事物的本质上。这个原理是放诸四海而皆准的基本原理：钱挣来就是要花的——不管早花还是晚花。甚至守财奴也要遵从这个原理，因为他攒钱的唯一理由就是将来有一天，会比现在更需要花钱。","Your imagination, once set in motion, will show you that your conjugal existence is divided into two great departments—the getting and the spending departments. Wordsworth1 chanted that in getting and spending we lay waste our powers. We could not lay waste our powers in a more satisfying manner. The two departments, mutually indispensable, balance each other. You organized them. You made yourself the head of one and your wife the head of the other. You might, of course, have organized them otherwise. It was open to you in the Hottentot style to decree that your wife should do the earning while you did the spending. But for some mysterious reason this arrangement did not appeal to you, and you accordingly go forth daily to the office and return there from with money. The theory of your daily excursion is firmly based in the inherent nature of things. The theory is the fundamental cosmic one that money is made in order that money may be spent—either at once or later. Even the miser conforms to this theory, for he only saves in obedience to the argument that the need of spending in the future may be more imperious than is the need of spending at the moment."
"你自己的全部个人行为都仅仅是在为欧米克隆太太的行为做准备。没有她的行为，你的行为会显得荒唐、可笑、无用和极端愚蠢。有她的花销，你的劳动才完整而有价值；她的花钱行为让你的人生圆满。你娶她就是为了让她花钱。你需要有个人来花钱，而大家都认为应该由她来填补这一位置。她被养大就是为了花钱，而你也知道她被养大就是为了花钱。花钱是她的职业。结果你背地里还抱怨，“她只想着花钱。”","The whole of your own personal activity is a mere preliminary to the activity of Mrs. Omicron. Without hers, yours would be absurd, ridiculous, futile, supremely silly. By spending she completes and justifies your labour; she crowns your life by spending. You married her so that she might spend. You wanted some one to spend, and it was understood that she should fill the situation. She was brought up to spend, and you knew that she was brought up to spend. Spending is her vocation. And yet you turn round on her and complain, “She only thinks of spending.”"
"“没错，”你说，“但总要有个节制。”我承认的确要有节制。英语里的“奢侈”一词不是个没用的词，它描述了一种确实存在的品质。必须承认这个自明之理，欧米克隆太太是个凡人。就好像挣钱的倾向会在你身上凸显，直到你成为一个贪婪又小气的爱财之人，花钱的倾向也会在她身上凸显。这是有先例的。必须偶尔遏制一下。这点没有异议！但是，欧米克隆先生，你要挑一个时间，选一种语气来做这件事，而不是在我所描述的这个晚上。把钻戒和不熟的羊腿、口味很淡的咖啡混在一起的男人都非常愚蠢。","“Yes,” you say, “but there is such a thing as moderation.” There is; I admit it. The word “extravagance” is no idle word in the English language. It describes a quality which exists. Let it be an axiom that Mrs. Omicron is human. Just as the tendency to get may grow on you, until you become a rapacious and stingy money-grubber, so the tendency to spend may grow on her. One has known instances. A check-action must be occasionally employed. Agreed! But, Mr. Omicron, you should choose a time and a tone for employing it other than you chose on this evening that I have described. A man who mixes up jewelled rings with underdone mutton and feeble coffee is a clumsy man."
"发挥你的想象力，把自己放在欧米克隆太太的位置上，就能体会她一直处于需要张口要钱这种极为微妙又尴尬的困难处境，或者她至少需要暗示说要给她钱。张口要钱是她的权力，甚至是她的义务，但这些愚蠢而没有逻辑的生物——大多数女人都是这样的，即使那些丈夫慷慨有礼的女人也一样——觉得这个行为有些屈辱。欧米克隆先生，你也许从没有张口要过钱。但你的想象力大概能让你感受到要钱是个什么滋味。一位无法挣钱却以花钱为任务的女士，有时在要钱时会遭到拒绝。但她永远都不应该遭到一种待遇——那就是怠慢。","Exercise your imagination to put yourself in the place of Mrs. Omicron, and you will perceive that she is constantly in the highly delicate difficulty of having to ask for money, or at any rate of having to suggest or insinuate that money should be given to her. It is her right and even her duty to ask for money, but the foolish, illogical creature—like most women, even those with generous and polite husbands—regards the process as a little humiliating for herself. You, Mr. Omicron, have perhaps never asked for money. But your imagination will probably be able to make you feel how it feels to ask for money. A woman whose business in life it is to spend money which she does not and cannot earn may sometimes have to face a refusal when she asks for money. But there is one thing from which she ought to be absolutely and eternally safe—and that is a snub."

"最后，作为一生都要和一位没有眼色的女人绑在一起的遭到虐待的丈夫，欧米克隆先生在思绪里进一步宣称欧米克隆太太只想着花钱和打扮自己。指责她只想着花钱不能完全发泄他的怒气，必须加上“打扮自己”。他当然会承认，她有时也的确会想些其他事情，但一般都像平凡人所抱怨的那样。不过，了不起的欧米克隆！你需要像一位明智的平凡人那样直面现实，运用你的想象力，好看清你的抱怨根本就没有根据。","And finally, in his reflections as an ill-used man tied for life to a woman who knows not tact, Mr. Omicron asserted further that Mrs. Omicron only thought of spending and titivating herself. To assert that she only thought of spending did not satisfy his spleen; he must add “titivating herself.” He would admit, of course, that she did as a fact sometimes think of other matters, but still he would uphold the gravamen of his charge. And yet—excellent Omicron!—you have but to look the truth in the face—as a plain common-sense man will—and to use your imagination, in order to perceive that there really is no gravamen in the charge."
"你为什么坚持要娶欧米克隆太太？她有着善于持家的名声（女孩都如此）；她是个正经姑娘，心肠好，家世无可挑剔，对金钱的期望也比较适度，聪明，受过良好教育，脾气好，漂亮。但事实上这些都不是你要娶她的原因。你娶她是因为你被她吸引，而吸引你的是她神秘、无法言说的特质——一种流露、一种气质、一种潜藏的光彩、谜一般的魅力。最后“魅力”这个词或许是她性格中让你神魂颠倒的要素。所有自由婚姻的情况都与此相似。大部分社会运动的根本原因也与此相似。唉，“支持女性投票权男子联盟”本身的成立就是这个现象造成的奇特结果。你娶欧米克隆太太无疑是因为她“合适”，但她的“合适”，对你来说，就体现在她呼吸的方式、穿过房间的仪态、一个短小的手势、声音中的一个颤音、一次脸红、一个眼神，一只手臂弯曲的姿态——微不足道，无关紧要——却是全部理由！","Why did you insist on marrying Mrs. Omicron? She had the reputation of being a good housekeeper (as girls go); she was a serious girl, kindhearted, of irreproachable family, having agreeable financial expectations, clever, well-educated, good-tempered, pretty. But the truth is that you married her for none of these attributes. You married her because you were attracted to her; and what attracted you was a mysterious, never to-be-defined quality about her—an effluence, an emanation, a lurking radiance, an entirely enigmatic charm. In the end “charm” is the one word that even roughly indicates that element in her personality which caused you to lose your head about her. A similar phenomenon is to be observed in all marriages of inclination. A similar phenomenon is at the bottom of most social movements. Why, the Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage itself certainly came into being through the strange workings of that same phenomenon! You married Mrs. Omicron doubtless because she was “suitable,” but her “suitability,” for you, consisted in the way she breathed, the way she crossed a room, a transient gesture, a vibration in her voice, a blush, a glance, the curve of an arm—nothing, nothing—and yet everything!"
"也许你对她的这些品质屈尊降贵，欧米克隆先生——你或许要把这些归为“女性魅力”而不予考虑，觉得和自己无关。但你无法和它划清关系。而且事实是，你永远都不可能有这种魅力，不管你有多能干、多理智。你是个极其聪明的好人，但你不可能仅凭走下楼梯的姿态、把围巾搭在肩上的动作或脸上显出的一丝神秘的忧郁，就让一屋子人神魂颠倒。你没有优雅这种天赋。你是个明智的人，但要是你不用轻蔑的态度对待这种魅力，你会更明智。这是世界上至高无上的东西，创造了大量的历史，而且还可能创造更多——甚至包括你的历史。","You may condescend towards this quality of hers, Mr. Omicron—you may try to dismiss it as “feminine charm,” and have done with it. But you cannot have done with it. And the fact will ever remain that you are incapable of supplying it yourself, with all your talents and your divine common sense. You are an extremely wise and good man, but you cannot ravish the senses of a roomful of people by merely walking downstairs, by merely throwing a shawl over your shoulders, by a curious depression in the corner of one cheek. This gift of grace is not yours. Wise as you are, you will be still wiser if you do not treat it disdainfully. It is among the supreme things in the world. It has made a mighty lot of history, and not improbably will make some more—even yours."
"你以前不是唯一知道她拥有这种不可抗拒力量（因为它的确不可抗拒）的人。她也曾经知道这点，而且现在仍旧知道。她知道当自己摆出某种姿态时，会让你产生一种感觉，尽管这感觉稍纵即逝，也依然是你最爱且独一无二的。而她这种令你烦扰却又着迷的特质是她生活的主要手段。难道她不应该珍惜、加强这种特质吗？正相反，你很清楚，如果欧米克隆太太看上去不重视这种需要戒指来加强的特质，你会感到难过和惊诧。如果你曾经走进一家领带店，然后被里面精美领带的景象搞得眼花缭乱到“尽情购买”——如果你有过这种奇特的经历，想象力稍加启发就能让你站在欧米克隆太太提到戒指时的位置上。“打扮自己？”老天啊，她是在帮助地球转动！结果你用一个致命的词打击了这个无助的人儿——就因为肉店的小伙计在街角贪玩了！","You were not the only person aware of the formidable power (for formidable it was) which she possessed over you. She, too, was aware of it, and is still. She knows that when she exists in a particular way, she will produce in your existence a sensation which, though fleeting, you prefer to all other sensations—a sensation unique. And this quality by which she disturbs and enchants you is her main resource in the adventure of life. Shall she not cherish this quality, adorn it, intensify it? On the contrary, you well know that you would be very upset and amazed if Mrs. Omicron were to show signs of neglecting this quality of hers which yearns for rings. And, if you have ever entered a necktie shop and been dazzled by the spectacle of a fine necktie into “hanging expense”—if you have been through this wondrous experience, your imagination, duly prodded, will enable you to put yourself into Mrs. Omicron’s place when she mentions the subject of rings. “Titivating herself?” Good heavens, she is helping the very earth to revolve! And you smote the defenceless creature with a lethal word—because the butcher’s boy dallied at a street-corner!"
"你含沙射影地说一只柔弱的手所戴的戒指会不会太多，但如果你使用了最喜欢的词“节制”，欧米克隆先生，我支持你。对于这一威胁我承认。但如果欧米克隆太太是凡人，我们就要谨记一个深刻的真理：大家都是一样的平凡人。","You insinuate that one frail hand may carry too many rings. You reproduce your favourite word “moderation.” Mr. Omicron, I take you. I agree as to the danger. But if Mrs. Omicron is human, let us also bear in mind the profound truth that not one of us is more human than another."
"1 威廉•华兹华斯（1770-1850），英国浪漫主义诗人。",""
