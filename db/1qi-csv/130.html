		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是在伦敦举行的一场宴会，用以向当代极为杰出的两三位军人中的其中一位表示敬意。由于真相即将揭晓，我就先隐去他的真实姓名和头衔，暂且称他为陆军中将阿瑟·斯科斯比勋爵、维多利亚十字勋章获得者、高级巴思勋爵士等等等等。这鼎鼎大名中都隐含了多少魅力啊！自从三十年前，他在克里米亚战场上突然声名鹊起以来，他的美名就不曾被人遗忘。而我虽然之前有千万次闻其大名，这回却见到了活生生的本人。面对这个神一样的人物，我看啊，看啊，就像欣赏美酒佳肴一般；我审视着，打量着，注意着：他安静、矜持、庄重的面容；他全身上下散发出的质朴和诚恳；让人觉得可爱的是，他并没有意识到自己的伟大——没有意识到成百上千双眼睛正带着崇敬的眼神注视着他，没有意识到在场人士对他那深沉的、充满喜爱之情的、诚挚的、发自肺腑的崇拜之情正涌溢而出，向他袭来。</td>
		<td class="en">It was at a banquet in London in honour of one of the two or three conspicuously illustrious English military names of this generation.For reasons which will presently appear, I will withhold his real name and titles, and call him Lieutenant-General Lord Arthur Scoresby, V.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc.What a fascination there is in a renowned name!There say the man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard of so many thousands of times since that day, thirty years before, when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a Crimean battle-field, to remain for ever celebrated.It was food and drink to me to look, and look, and look at that demigod; scanning, searching, noting: the quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his countenance; the simple honesty that expressed itself all over him; the sweet unconsciousness of his greatness—unconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon him, unconsciousness of the deep, loving, sincere worship welling out of the breasts of those people and flowing toward him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我左边的牧师是我的老相识——他现在是个牧师，但他的前半生是在军营和战场上度过的；他曾在伍利奇的军事学校里当教员。就在我闲谈的时候，牧师的眼中闪过一丝模糊而异样的光芒。他朝我凑过来，指着宴会的主角，神神秘秘地低声说道：“私底下告诉你——他的荣誉其实是偶然得之的，只是他交了不可思议的好运罢了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The clergyman at my left was an old acquaintance of mine—clergyman now, but had spent the first half of his life in the camp and field, and as an instructor in the military school at Woolwich.Just at the moment I have been talking about, a veiled and singular light glimmered in his eyes, and he leaned down and muttered confidentially to me—indicating the hero of the banquet with a gesture,—‘Privately—his glory is an accident—just a product of incredible luck.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个评价让我大吃一惊。就算把评价对象换成拿破仑、苏格拉底或所罗门，也不会让我觉得更惊讶了。</td>
		<td class="en">This verdict was a great surprise to me.If its subject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon, my astonishment could not have been greater.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几天之后，我得到了这个奇怪评价的解释，以下就是牧师告诉我的故事：</td>
		<td class="en">Some days later came the explanation of this strange remark, and this is what the Reverend told me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约摸四十年前，我还是伍利奇地方军事学校的教员。当时，年轻的斯科斯比正参加初试，其中的一个考试环节我刚好在场。我对这个家伙大动怜悯之心，因为班上其他人都把问题回答得机灵漂亮，而他——哦，我的天哪，他可以说是一无所知。显然，他很乖、讨人喜欢、可爱又老实；因此，看到他像座雕像似的安静地站在那里，说出对他这种愚昧无知的人来说根本不可思议的答案时，真是一件极其痛苦的事。于是，我对他动了恻隐之心。我暗想，他再来参加考试一定会被淘汰掉的。因此，尽我所能减轻他落榜的痛苦仅仅是个善意之举。</td>
		<td class="en">About forty years ago I was an instructor in the military academy at Woolwich.I was present in one of the sections when young Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination.I was touched to the quick with pity; for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely, while he—why, dear me, he didn’t know anything, so to speak.He was evidently good, and sweet, and lovable, and guileless; and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there, as serene as a graven image, and deliver himself of answers which were veritably miraculous for stupidity and ignorance.All the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf.I said to myself, when he comes to be examined again, he will be flung over, of course; so it will be simple a harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much as I can.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我将他带到一边，发现他对凯撒的历史还略知一二；因为他对别的都一无所知，所以我开始行动，像训练苦力一样用自认为会考到的关于凯撒的常见问题去训练他。请相信我，那天他出色地通过了考试！就凭考前那完全肤浅的“死记硬背”，他不仅通过了考试，还受到了夸奖，而那些比他学识渊博一千倍的人却落第了。由于某种不可思议的幸运巧合——百年一遇的巧合——问他的问题没有一个是超出他那狭窄的训练范围的。</td>
		<td class="en">I took him aside, and found that he knew a little of Caesar’s history; and as he didn’t know anything else, I went to work and drilled him like a galley-slave on a certain line of stock questions concerning Caesar which I knew would be used.If you’ll believe me, he went through with flying colours on examination day!He went through on that purely superficial ‘cram’, and got compliments, too, while others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got plucked.By some strangely lucky accident—an accident not likely to happen twice in a century—he was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his drill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这真让人惊呆。可在他的整个考试进程中，尽管我一直陪伴着他，像母亲爱她的跛脚孩子一般怜爱他，但显而易见，他每次都能奇迹般地自己化险为夷。</td>
		<td class="en">It was stupefying.Well, although through his course I stood by him, with something of the sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled child; and he always saved himself—just by miracle, apparently.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，最终会让事情败露并葬送他前程的自然是数学了。我决心要尽力不让他死得太惨，因此在命题人最有可能出题的范围内，我反复强化训练他，像填鸭一样让他死记硬背，然后把他推向了命运的轨道。哦，先生，你猜结果如何？让我大吃一惊：他得了第一名！他因此得了个满堂彩，赞扬声一片。</td>
		<td class="en">Now of course the thing that would expose him and kill him at last was mathematics.I resolved to make his death as easy as I could; so I drilled him and crammed him, and crammed him and drilled him, just on the line of questions which the examiner would be most likely to use, and then launched him on his fate.Well, sir, try to conceive of the result: to my consternation, he took the first prize!And with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compliments.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >睡觉!我整整一个礼拜没合眼。我的良心搅得我日夜不宁。我所做的一切仅仅是出于同情，我只是不想让这个可怜的年轻人败得太惨——我之前做梦都没想到会发生这样的荒唐事。我就像弗兰肯斯泰因的创造者一样，感到又愧疚又痛苦。这个榆木疙瘩被我推上了飞黄腾达之途，肩负起了重大的责任，但极有可能的是，在得到第一次机会时，他就会和他所担起的重任一同毁灭。</td>
		<td class="en">Sleep!There was no more sleep for me for a week.My conscience tortured me day and night.What I had done I had done purely through charity, and only to ease the poor youth’s fall—I never had dreamed of any such preposterous result as the thing that had happened.I felt as guilty and miserable as the creator of Frankenstein.Here was a wooden-head whom I had put in the way of glittering promotions and prodigious responsibilities, and but one thing could happen: he and his responsibilities would all go to ruin together at the first opportunity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当时克里米亚战争刚刚爆发。当然一定要有场战争，我对自己说：可不能在和平时期让这头蠢驴没被揭穿老底就命丧黄泉。我等待着这场变动。它如期而至。而它真正到来时却让我感到眩晕。公报上说他已被任命为一个即将奔赴前线的军团上尉！比他优秀的人在部队里熬白了头也没能爬上这样的高位。谁会料想到，他们竟然将这样的重担放在这个毫无经验的、不够格的新兵肩上呢？要是他们叫他当个掌旗官，我还能勉强接受，但是当上尉——想想吧！我想我头发都要愁白了。</td>
		<td class="en">The Crimean war had just broken out.Of course there had to be a war, I said to myself: we couldn’t have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is found out.I waited for the earthquake.It came.And it made me reel when it did come.He was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment!Better men grow old and gray in the service before they climb to a sublimity like that.And who could ever have foreseen that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such green and inadequate shoulders?I could just barely have stood it if they had made him a cornet; but a captain—think of it!I thought my hair would turn white.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >想想我都干了什么——我本是一个极爱平静和慵懒的人。我对自己说，我要为此向我的国家负责，我必须和他一道竭尽全力保护祖国，免于使之毁在他手里。于是，我带上我几十年辛苦劳作、省吃俭用攒下的可怜的一点儿钱，叹着气买下了他所在军团的掌旗官一职，然后我们奔赴战场。</td>
		<td class="en">Consider what I did—I who so loved repose and inaction.I said to myself, I am responsible to the country for this, and I must go along with him and protect the country against him as far as I can.So I took my poor little capital that I had saved up through years of work and grinding economy, and went with a sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment, and away we went to the field.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了那里——哦，天哪，简直糟透了。犯错误？唉，他除了犯错之外就没干别的事。但是，你知道吗，没人清楚这个家伙的底细——每个人都看走了眼，每次都必定误解他的表现——结果，他们把他的愚蠢错误当成是他天才的灵感；他们真是这么想的！他所犯的最微小的错误都足以让一个神智正常的人哭喊出来；这些错误也的确让我哭喊——暗地里也狂怒、咆哮。而让我提心吊胆、焦头烂额的是，他每捅一个新娄子，都会为他的声名增光添彩。我一直对自己说，他爬得那么高，当他原形毕露时，一定会像太阳从高空坠落一样。</td>
		<td class="en">And there—oh dear, it was awful.Blunders? why, he never did anything but blunder.But, you see, nobody was in the fellow’s secret—everybody had him focused wrong, and necessarily misinterpreted his performance every time—consequently they took his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius; they did honestly!His mildest blunders were enough to make a man in his right mind cry; and they did make me cry—and rage and rave too, privately.And the thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension was the fact that every fresh blunder he made increased the lustre of his reputation!I kept saying to myself, he’ll get so high that when discovery does finally come it will be like the sun falling out of the sky.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可他却跨过上级的尸体，一级一级，步步高升。直到最后，到了战事最为激烈的时刻……我们的上校倒下了，我的心跳到了嗓子眼，因为斯科斯比就是他的下一级！现在好了，我想，不出十分钟，我们肯定都要下阴曹地府去了。</td>
		<td class="en">He went right along up, from grade to grade, over the dead bodies of his superiors, until at last, in the hottest moment of the battle of… down went our colonel, and my heart jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was next in rank!Now for it, said I; we’ll all land in Sheol in ten minutes, sure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那场战役十分激烈，联军在全部战场上都节节败退。我们军团占据了重要阵地，此时一旦失误必将全军覆没。在这千钧一发之际，这个命大的笨蛋将军团从阵地上调离，下令向邻近一座根本没有敌人影子的山上冲锋！“又来了！”我对自己说，“这是最后的结局了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The battle was awfully hot; the allies were steadily giving way all over the field.Our regiment occupied a position that was vital; a blunder now must be destruction.At this critical moment, what does this immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its place and order a charge over a neighbouring hill where there wasn’t a suggestion of an enemy!‘There you go!’ I said to myself; ‘this is the end at last.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这疯狂的举动还未被发现和阻止之前，我们就已经离开了阵地，爬上了那座山的山肩。你猜我们看到了什么？令人意想不到的一整支俄国预备军队！后来怎么样了？我们被击垮了吗？当然，十有八九应当是那种结局。但是错了，那些俄国人认定，在这种时刻，单独一个团是不可能随便逛到那里去的。一定是整支英国军队都来了，狡猾的俄国把戏被识破了，行不通了。于是他们掉头就跑，匆匆忙忙地越过山头，进入战场，乱成一团，我们则在他们后面追击。他们溃不成军，自己冲破并击垮了战场上坚固的俄军核心部署，很快便出现了前所未见的大溃败，而英国联军则彻彻底底地转败为胜了！康罗贝尔元帅看着这一切，被惊奇、钦佩和快乐冲昏了头脑；他即刻派人请来斯科斯比，当着所有军士的面在战场上拥抱了他，并为他授勋！</td>
		<td class="en">And away we did go, and were over the shoulder of the hill before the insane movement could be discovered and stopped.And what did we find?An entire and unsuspected Russian army in reserve!And what happened?We were eaten up?That is necessarily what would have happened in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.But no; those Russians argued that no single regiment would come browsing around there at such a time.It must be the entire English army, and that the sly Russian game was detected and blocked; so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell, over the hill and down into the field, in wild confusion, and we after them; they themselves broke the solid Russia centre in the field, and tore through, and in no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever saw, and the defeat of the allies was turned into a sweeping and splendid victory!Marshal Canrobert looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration, and delight; and sent right off for Scoresby, and hugged him, and decorated him on the field in presence of all the armies!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一次，斯科斯比的错误又出在哪里呢？只不过是把右手错当成左手——就那么简单。上级下达命令让他撤退，去支援右翼部队；相反地，他却冲锋去了左边的山头。然而，他那天却赢得了军事天才的美名，誉满天下；他的荣誉也将流芳千古、永垂史册。</td>
		<td class="en">And what was Scoresby’s blunder that time?Merely the mistaking his right hand for his left—that was all.An order had come to him to fall back and support our right; and instead he fell forward and went over the hill to the left.But the name he won that day as a marvellous military genius filled the world with his glory, and that glory will never fade while history books last.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他和其他人一样善良、亲切、可爱、谦逊，但他无知得连下了雨都不知道要进屋去。一天天、一年年过去，一直有超乎寻常的惊人好运追随着他。在我们十五年里经历的所有战役中，他一直都是一名杰出的士兵；他的戎马生涯纰漏百出，可没有一次错误妨碍他成为爵士、准男爵、勋爵或是别的什么。瞧他胸前，啊，挂满了国内外的各种勋章。哦，先生，每一枚勋章都记录着这样或那样的蠢事，而将这一切合起来看则证明一点：在这个世界上，降临到一个人头上的最好的事就是生来走运。</td>
		<td class="en">He is just as good and sweet and lovable and unpretending as a man can be, but he doesn’t know enough to come in when it rains.He has been pursued, day by day and year by year, by a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness.He has been a shining soldier in all our wars for half a generation; he has littered his military life with blunders, and yet has never committed one that didn’t make him a knight or a baronet or a lord or something.Look at his breast; why, he is just clothed in domestic and foreign decorations.Well, sir, every one of them is a record of some stupidity or other; and, taken together, they are proof that the very best thing in all this world that can befall a man is to be born lucky.</td></tr>
