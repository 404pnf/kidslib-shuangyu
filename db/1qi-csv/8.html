		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >银婚日这天，阿什赫斯特和妻子在荒野边上驱车前行。他们想使这个节日锦上添花，晚上停在他们第一次相遇的地方——托基过夜。这是斯特拉·阿什赫斯特的主意。她天性浪漫善感。斯特拉早已失去了双眸的湛蓝、花儿般的魅力、纯净清爽的脸庞和修长的身形，还有苹果花般的气色——二十六年前，这些都曾迅速而神奇地吸引了阿什赫斯特。即便四十三岁的她早已失去了这些，两颊已略显有斑点，灰蓝色的眼眸露出几分老成，但仍不失为一位可人、忠诚的伴侣。</td>
		<td class="en">In their silver-wedding day Ashurst and his wife were motoring along the outskirts of the moor, intending to crown the festival by stopping the night at Torquay, where they had first met.This was the idea of Stella Ashurst, whose character contained a streak of sentiment.If she had long lost the blue-eyed, flower-like charm, the cool slim purity of face and form, the apple-blossom colouring, which had so swiftly and so oddly affected Ashurst twenty-six years ago, she was still at forty-three a comely and faithful companion, whose cheeks were faintly mottled, and whose grey-blue eyes had acquired a certain fullness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她让车子停下。这个地方的左边是一块陡峭的公地。一处狭长地带上生长着落叶松和山毛榉，疏疏落落地夹杂着几棵松柏。它一直向公路和整片荒野上第一个又长又高的山岗之间的山谷方向延伸。斯特拉正在寻找吃午餐的地方，因为阿什赫斯特从不寻找什么。这个地方位于一片金雀花和几棵落叶松之间，落叶松嫩绿的羽毛状叶子在四月落日的余晖里散发着柠檬般的清香。从这里可以俯瞰深邃的峡谷，远眺连绵的荒原高地。这里正迎合了一个热爱浪漫景致的水彩画家的果断天性。她抓起画箱，下了车。</td>
		<td class="en">It was she who had stopped the car where the common rose steeply to the left, and a narrow strip of larch and beech, with here and there a pine, stretched out towards the valley between the road and the first long high hill of the full moor.She was looking for a place where they might lunch, for Ashurst never looked for anything; and this, between the golden furze and the feathery green larches smelling of lemons in the last sun of April—this, with a view into the deep valley and up to the long moor heights, seemed fitting to the decisive nature of one who sketched in water-colours, and loved romantic spots.Grasping her paint box, she got out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这儿行吗，弗兰克？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Won’t this do, Frank?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >四十八岁的阿什赫斯特酷似大胡子席勒，两鬓斑白，个子高挑，双腿修长，还长着一双深邃的灰色大眼睛。他的眼中有时饱含深意，几乎显得很美，鼻子有点往一边歪，被胡须盖住的嘴唇张着。他默默地抓起餐篮，也下了车。</td>
		<td class="en">Ashurst, rather like a bearded Schiller, grey in the wings, tall, long-legged, with large remote grey eyes which sometimes filled with meaning and became almost beautiful, with nose a little to one side, and bearded lips just open—Ashurst, forty-eight, and silent, grasped the luncheon basket, and got out too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢！看，弗兰克！一座坟墓！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh! Look,Frank! A grave!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有条与公路直角相交的小道从公地的顶端延伸而下，经过狭长的小树林，穿过一个大门。公路的边上有一方覆盖着薄薄青草的土丘，六英尺长，一英尺宽，西面立着一块花岗石。有人在土丘上放了一枝黑刺李和一把风铃草。阿什赫斯特看着，眼前之景触动了他的诗人情怀。葬在岔路口——那一定是一个自杀者的坟墓！可怜而迷信的世人啊！但是，不管是谁葬在这里，他都占据了最好的坟墓：它不是夹在其他阴森的坟墓之间的湿冷墓穴，墓碑上也没有刻着那些废话——有的只是一块天然的石头、广阔的天空和路边的祝福！阿什赫斯特什么都没说，因为他已经学会不在家人面前做一个哲学家了。他大步走上那片公地，把餐篮放在墙根，在地上铺了一块毯子，等着妻子来坐——她饿了，自然就会停下画笔，来这儿吃饭。阿什赫斯特从兜里掏出默里翻译的《希波吕托斯》读了起来。很快，他就读完了“圣西普里安”和她的复仇故事，然后抬头望起天来。朵朵白云在湛蓝的天空映衬下分外明亮。在银婚日，阿什赫斯特渴望着——渴望着他自己也不清楚的什么东西。男人的有机组织和生活是多么不协调啊！一个男人的生活方式可能是高尚的、小心谨慎的，但总是存在一股贪婪的暗流、一种渴望和一种蹉跎之感。女人也会有这样的感觉吗？谁知道呢？然而，那些纵情于新奇、一味追求新的不平凡经历、新的冒险和新的享乐的男人，毫无疑问，并不是因饥饿所苦。恰恰相反，他们为饮食过度而苦。文明的男人犹如一只精神失常的野兽，困在这里，无法逃离！对于任何一个具有审美感的男子来说，没有自己钟爱的花园——如同动听的希腊颂歌中唱到的那种充满“苹果树、歌声和金子”的花园，没有他可抵达的天堂，或者说，没有一个幸福的永久安息所。没有什么能与艺术品中捕捉到的那份美相比，这种美是永恒的，只要看到它或读到它，就总能获得同样珍贵的欢乐和沁心的迷醉。毋庸置疑，生活中从不缺乏那种美的时刻，也不缺出人意料、忽然而至的狂喜。可问题是，它们持续的时间短暂如云朵掠过太阳。你不能留下它们，像艺术捕捉到美并牢牢抓住它那样。它们转瞬即逝，就像你看到的自然中灵魂那闪着微光或金色的幻影那样，只能瞥上几眼它飘渺而沉思的神采。太阳热辣辣地照在他的脸上，荆棘树上一只布谷鸟咕咕地叫着，空气中弥漫着金雀花的芳香，嫩绿的蕨叶中如星星般点缀着黑刺李，白云飘荡在群山和如梦如幻般的山谷之上的高空——此时此地，正是这样的一瞥。但是，马上它就像牧羊神的脸一样，刚从石头的一角露出来，你一注视，便消失得无影无踪。突然，他坐了起来。这个地方的确有点儿眼熟——这块公地、这条小路和身后的这堵老墙。他们开车的时候，他一直没有注意到，从来没注意到——他在想着遥不可及的事，或什么都没想——但是，现在他看清了。二十六年前，也是在这个时节，那天他从托基离这个地方不到半英里的农舍出发。可以说他那次一走就再也没有回来。他心中忽然一痛：他正好撞到过往生命中的一段往事上了，他没能捕捉到其中的美好和欢乐，它扑着翅膀飞入未知的世界了。他触及了一段尘封的回忆，想起了那段狂野、甜蜜、但被迅速扼杀的时光。于是，他转过身，两手托着下巴，凝视着长着蓝色小远志花的那片矮草地……</td>
		<td class="en">By the side of the road, where the track from the top of the common crossed it at right angles and ran through a gate past the narrow wood, was a thin mound of turf, six feet by one, with a moorstone to the west, and on it someone had thrown a blackthorn spray and a handful of bluebells.Ashurst looked, and the poet in him moved.At cross-roads—a suicide’s grave!Poor mortals with their superstitions!Whoever lay there, though, had the best of it, no clammy sepulchre among other hideous graves carved with futilities—just a rough stone, the wide sky, and wayside blessings!And, without comment, for he had learned not to be a philosopher in the bosom of his family, he strode away up on to the common, dropped the luncheon basket under a wall, spread a rug for his wife to sit on—she would turn up from her sketching when she was hungry—and took from his pocket Murray’s translation of the@Hippolytus@.He had soon finished reading of “The Cyprian” and her revenge, and looked at the sky instead.And watching the white clouds so bright against the intense blue, Ashurst, on his silver-wedding day, longed for—he knew not what.Maladjusted to life—man’s organism!One’s mode of life might be high and scrupulous, but there was always an undercurrent of greediness, a hankering, and sense of waste.Did women have it too?Who could tell?And yet, men who gave vent to their appetites for novelty, their riotous longings for new adventures, new risks, new pleasures, these suffered, no doubt, from the reverse side of starvation, from surfeit.No getting out of it—a maladjusted animal, civilised man!There could be no garden of his choosing, of “the Apple-tree, the singing, and the gold,” in the words of that lovely Greek chorus, no achievable elysium in life, or lasting haven of happiness for any man with a sense of beauty—nothing which could compare with the captured loveliness in a work of art, set down for ever, so that to look on it or read was always to have the same precious sense of exaltation and restful inebriety.Life no doubt had moments with that quality of beauty, of unbidden flying rapture, but the trouble was, they lasted no longer than the span of a cloud’s flight over the sun; impossible to keep them with you, as Art caught beauty and held it fast.They were fleeting as one of the glimmering or golden visions one had of the soul in nature, glimpses of its remote and brooding spirit.Here, with the sun hot on his face, a cuckoo calling from a thorn tree, and in the air the honey savour of gorse—here among the little fronds of the young fern, the starry blackthorn, while the bright clouds drifted by high above the hills and dreamy valleys here and now was such a glimpse.But in a moment it would pass—as the face of Pan, which looks round the corner of a rock, vanishes at your stare.And suddenly he sat up.Surely there was something familiar about this view, this bit of common, that ribbon of road, the old wall behind him.While they were driving he had not been taking notice—never did; thinking of far things or of nothing—but now he saw!Twenty-six years ago, just at this time of year, from the farmhouse within half a mile of this very spot he had started for that day in Torquay whence it might be said he had never returned.And a sudden ache beset his heart; he had stumbled on just one of those past moments in his life, whose beauty and rapture he had failed to arrest, whose wings had fluttered away into the unknown; he had stumbled on a buried memory, a wild sweet time, swiftly choked and ended.And, turning on his face, he rested his chin on his hands, and stared at the short grass where the little blue milkwort was growing....</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And this is what he remembered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大学毕业后的第一个五月一日，弗兰克·阿什赫斯特和朋友罗伯特·加顿正在徒步旅行。这一天，他们从布伦特出发，目的地是查格福德。但是，阿什赫斯特踢足球时受伤的膝盖已坚持不了了。按照地图，他们还有约七英里的路要走。</td>
		<td class="en">On the first of May, after their last year together at college, Frank Ashurst and his friend Robert Garton were on a tramp.They had walked that day from Brent, intending to make Chagford, but Ashurst’s football knee had given out, and according to their map they had still some seven miles to go.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在一条小径沿着树林穿过道路。他们在路旁的一个土堆上坐下，边让膝盖歇着边海阔天空地聊着，通常年轻人都这样聊天。他们的身高都超过了六英尺，而且都像栏杆一般瘦。阿什赫斯特面色苍白，是个理想主义者，心不在焉。加顿举止古怪，冲动易变，身强体壮，头发卷曲，活脱脱一头原始的野兽。两人都有文学爱好，谁都没带帽子。</td>
		<td class="en">They were sitting on a bank beside the road, where a track crossed alongside a wood, resting the knee and talking of the universe, as young men will.Both were over six feet, and thin as rails; Ashurst pale, idealistic, full of absence; Garton queer, round-the-corner, knotted, curly, like some primeval beast.Both had a literary bent; neither wore a hat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿什赫斯特的头发是浅色、光滑的，有点弯曲，两鬓的头发翘着，好像总是向后甩的样子。加顿的头发则乱蓬蓬的，且乌黑，深不可测。方圆几英里内，他们没有遇到过一个人。</td>
		<td class="en">Ashurst’s hair was smooth, pale, wavy, and had a way of rising on either side of his brow, as if always being flung back; Carton’s was a kind of dark unfathomed mop.They had not met a soul for miles.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“My dear chap, all our modern unhappiness comes from pity.Look at animals, and Red Indians, limited to feeling their own occasional misfortunes; then look at ourselves—never free from feeling the toothaches of others.Let’s get back to feeling for nobody, and have a better time.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊！这也太英格兰式了吧？如果你谈到感情，英格兰人总认为你是想要肉体方面的东西，并为之感到震惊。他们害怕激情，但不怕肉欲——噢，他们不怕！只要他们能把它当秘密保守的话。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah! That’s so English!If you speak of emotion the English always think you want something physical, and are shocked.They’re afraid of passion, but not of lust—oh, no!—so long as they can keep it secret.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿什赫斯特没有回答，他摘了一朵蓝色的小花，对着天空拨捻着。荆棘树上传来布谷鸟的叫声。天空、花朵，还有鸟儿的歌唱！罗伯特还在胡说八道！</td>
		<td class="en">Ashurst did not answer; he had plucked a blue floweret, and was twiddling it against the sky.A cuckoo began calling from a thorn tree.The sky, the flowers, the songs of birds!Robert was talking through his hat!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，他说道：“好了，咱们赶路吧，还得找个农场过夜。”正说着，他发觉一个姑娘正从他们上方的公地上走下来。她挎着篮子，天空成为她轮廓的背景，还能从她的臂弯处看到那方天空。阿什赫斯特是那种看到美人从不会想到自己会得到什么好处的人，只是心想：“真美啊！”风吹起她黑色的粗绒呢裙，拂着她的腿，掀起压扁了的孔雀蓝苏格兰圆帽。她的浅灰色短罩衫已经破旧了，鞋子也裂开了，两只小手粗糙发红，脖子晒成了棕色。她那乌黑的头发凌乱地散落在宽阔的前额上。她的脸是短的，上唇是短的，露出亮亮的牙齿，眉毛又直又黑，睫毛又长又黑，鼻梁很直。但是，她那双灰色的眼睛真是奇妙，像朝露一样水汪汪的，仿佛是那天第一次睁开似的。她打量着阿什赫斯特。也许他的模样让她觉得奇怪——没戴帽子，头发向后撩着，大大的眼睛盯着她，一瘸一拐地朝她走来。他没戴帽子，所以无法脱帽致敬，只好举手问候，说道：</td>
		<td class="en">And he said: “Well, let’s go on, and find some farm where we can put up.”In uttering those words, he was conscious of a girl coming down from the common just above them.She was outlined against the sky, carrying a basket, and you could see that sky through the crook of her arm.And Ashurst, who saw beauty without wondering how it could advantage him, thought: “How pretty!”The wind, blowing her dark frieze skirt against her legs, lifted her battered peacock tam-o’-shanter; her greyish blouse was worn and old, her shoes were split, her little hands rough and red, her neck browned.Her dark hair waved untidy across her broad forehead, her face was short, her upper lip short, showing a glint of teeth, her brows were straight and dark, her lashes long and dark, her nose straight; but her grey eyes were the wonder-dewy as if opened for the first time that day.She looked at Ashurst—perhaps he struck her as strange, limping along without a hat, with his large eyes on her, and his hair falling back.He could not take off what was not on his head, but put up his hand in a salute, and said:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And Ashurst puffed his pipe.Awaken her!That fool had the best opinion of himself!He threw up the window and leaned out.Dusk had gathered thick.The farm buildings and the wheel-house were all dim and bluish, the apple trees but a blurred wilderness; the air smelled of woodsmoke from the kitchen fire.One bird going to bed later than the others was uttering a half-hearted twitter, as though surprised at the darkness.From the stable came the snuffle and stamp of a feeding horse.And away over there was the loom of the moor, and away and away the shy stars which had not as yet full light, pricking white through the deep blue heavens.A quavering owl hooted.Ashurst drew a deep breath.What a night to wander out in!A padding of unshod hoofs came up the lane, and three dim, dark shapes passed—ponies on an evening march.Their heads, black and fuzzy, showed above the gate.At the tap of his pipe, and a shower of little sparks, they shied round and scampered.A bat went fluttering past, uttering its almost inaudible “chip, chip.”Ashurst held out his hand; on the upturned palm he could feel the dew.Suddenly from overhead he heard little burring boys’ voices, little thumps of boots thrown down, and another voice, crisp and soft—the girl’s putting them to bed, no doubt; and nine clear words “No, Rick, you can’t have the cat in bed”; then came a skirmish of giggles and gurgles, a soft slap, a laugh so low and pretty that it made him shiver a little.A blowing sound, and the glim of the candle which was fingering the dusk above, went out; silence reigned.Ashurst withdrew into the room and sat down; his knee pained him, and his soul felt gloomy.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For Ashurst the wheel of slumber was wont to turn noiseless and slick and swift, but though he seemed sunk in sleep when his companion came up, he was really wide awake; and long after Carton, smothered in the other bed of that low-roofed room, was worshipping darkness with his upturned nose, he heard the owls.Barring the discomfort of his knee, it was not unpleasant—the cares of life did not loom large in night watches for this young man.In fact he had none; just enrolled a barrister, with literary aspirations, the world before him, no father or mother, and four hundred a year of his own.Did it matter where he went, what he did, or when he did it?His bed, too, was hard, and this preserved him from fever.He lay, sniffing the scent of the night which drifted into the low room through the open casement close to his head.Except for a definite irritation with his friend, natural when you have tramped with a man for three days, Ashurst’s memories and visions that sleepless night were kindly and wistful and exciting.One vision, specially clear and unreasonable, for he had not even been conscious of noting it, was the face of the youth cleaning the gun; its intent, stolid, yet startled uplook at the kitchen doorway, quickly shifted to the girl carrying the cider jug.This red, blue-eyed, light-lashed, tow-haired face stuck as firmly in his memory as the girl’s own face, so dewy and simple.But at last, in the square of darkness through the uncurtained casement, he saw day coming, and heard one hoarse and sleepy caw.Then followed silence, dead as ever, till the song of a blackbird, not properly awake, adventured into the hush.And, from staring at the framed brightening light, Ashurst fell asleep.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He stayed up there for hours, till it grew cold, then groped his way down the stones and heather roots to the road, back into the lane, and came again past the wild meadow to the orchard.There he struck a match and looked at his watch.Nearly twelve!It was black and unstirring in there now, very different from the lingering, bird-befriended brightness of six hours ago!And suddenly he saw this idyll of his with the eyes of the outer world—had mental vision of Mrs. Narracombe’s snake-like neck turned, her quick dark glance taking it all in, her shrewd face hardening; saw the gipsy-like cousins coarsely mocking and distrustful; Joe stolid and furious; only the lame man, Jim, with the suffering eyes, seemed tolerable to his mind.And the village pub!—the gossiping matrons he passed on his walks; and then—his own friends—Robert Carton’s smile when he went off that morning ten days ago; so ironical and knowing!Disgusting!For a minute he literally hated this earthy, cynical world to which one belonged, willy-nilly.The gate where he was leaning grew grey, a sort of shimmer passed before him and spread into the bluish darkness.The moon!He could just see it over the bank behind; red, nearly round—a strange moon!And turning away, he went up the lane which smelled of the night and cow dung and young leaves.In the straw-yard he could see the dark shapes of cattle, broken by the pale sickles of their horns, like so many thin moons, fallen ends-up.He unlatched the farm gate stealthily.All was dark in the house.Muffling his footsteps, he gained the porch, and, blotted against one of the yew trees, looked up at Megan’s window.It was open.Was she sleeping, or lying awake perhaps, disturbed—unhappy at his absence?An owl hooted while he stood there peering up, and the sound seemed to fill the whole night, so quiet was all else, save for the never-ending murmur of the stream running below the orchard.The cuckoos by day, and now the owls—how wonderfully they voiced this troubled ecstasy within him!And suddenly he saw her at her window, looking out.He moved a little from the yew tree, and whispered: “Megan!”She drew back, vanished, reappeared, leaning far down.He stole forward on the grass patch, hit his shin against the green-painted chair, and held his breath at the sound.The pale blur of her stretched-down arm and face did not stir; he moved the chair, and noiselessly mounted it.By stretching up his arm he could just reach.Her hand held the huge key of the front door, and he clasped that burning hand with the cold key in it.He could just see her face, the glint of teeth between her lips, her tumbled hair.She was still dressed—poor child, sitting up for him, no doubt!“Pretty Megan!”Her hot, roughened fingers clung to his; her face had a strange, lost look.To have been able to reach it—even with his hand!The owl hooted, a scent of sweetbriar crept into his nostrils.Then one of the farm dogs barked; her grasp relaxed, she shrank back.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Lovin’ hearted!”Yes!And what was he doing?What were his intentions—as they say towards this loving-hearted girl?The thought dogged him, wandering through fields bright with buttercups, where the little red calves were feeding, and the swallows flying high.Yes, the oaks were before the ashes, brown-gold already; every tree in different stage and hue.The cuckoos and a thousand birds were singing; the little streams were very bright.The ancients believed in a golden age, in the garden of the Hesperides!...A queen wasp settled on his sleeve.Each queen wasp killed meant two thousand fewer wasps to thieve the apples which would grow from that blossom in the orchard; but who, with love in his heart, could kill anything on a day like this?He entered a field where a young red bull was feeding.It seemed to Ashurst that he looked like Joe.But the young bull took no notice of this visitor, a little drunk himself, perhaps, on the singing and the glamour of the golden pasture, under his short legs.Ashurst crossed out unchallenged to the hillside above the stream.From that slope a tor mounted to its crown of rocks.The ground there was covered with a mist of bluebells, and nearly a score of crab-apple trees were in full bloom.He threw himself down on the grass.The change from the buttercup glory and oak-goldened glamour of the fields to this ethereal beauty under the grey tor filled him with a sort of wonder; nothing the same, save the sound of running water and the songs of the cuckoos.He lay there a long time, watching the sunlight wheel till the crab-trees threw shadows over the bluebells, his only companions a few wild bees.He was not quite sane, thinking of that morning’s kiss, and of to-night under the apple tree.In such a spot as this, fauns and dryads surely lived; nymphs, white as the crab-apple blossom, retired within those trees; fauns, brown as the dead bracken, with pointed ears, lay in wait for them.The cuckoos were still calling when he woke, there was the sound of running water; but the sun had couched behind the tor, the hillside was cool, and some rabbits had come out.“Tonight!” he thought.Just as from the earth everything was pushing up, unfolding under the soft insistent fingers of an unseen hand, so were his heart and senses being pushed, unfolded.He got up and broke off a spray from a crab-apple tree.The buds were like Megan—shell-like, rose-pink, wild, and fresh; and so, too, the opening flowers, white, and wild; and touching.He put the spray into his coat.And all the rush of the spring within him escaped in a triumphant sigh.But the rabbits scurried away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚上，阿什赫斯特放下袖珍版的《奥德赛》时——这本书他拿在手里半个小时都没有读——已经快十一点了。他悄悄穿过院子，进了果园。金色的月亮刚刚升起，挂在山上，就像一个明亮、强大、时刻守候的精灵，正透过半裸的梣树枝搭成的栅栏窥视着。苹果树林里还很黑。他驻足确认了一下方向，用脚在乱草中摸索着前进。离他身后很近的一团黑影被惊动了，发出沉重的咕噜声。原来是三头大猪，它们紧挨着彼此，重新靠着墙根躺下。他听着。没有风，但小河潺潺的水声却是白天的两倍响。一只他叫不出名的鸟发出单调的“噗噗”“噗——噗”声。他能听到远处一只夜鹰在盘旋。猫头鹰也在叫着。阿什赫斯特向前走了一两步，再次驻足，感觉头上有一片白茫茫的东西，在昏暗中动着。昏暗静止的苹果树上，无数柔和模糊的花朵和花蕾被缓缓移动的月光赋予了生命。他有一种极其奇怪的感觉，好像他真的有伴似的，仿佛百万只白色飞蛾或精灵浮动起来，停在昏暗的夜幕和更加昏暗的地面之间，就在他眼前扑着翅膀。这一刻的美平静，没有味道，让人迷惑。他几乎忘记了自己来果园是为了什么。夜幕降临，白天笼罩大地的那种在空中飞舞的魅力并没有消失，它只不过是换成了眼前这种新形式了。他在茂密的树枝和根茎间继续前行，上面覆盖着那种灵动的粉状白色。他来到大苹果树下。没错，就是这儿。即使在黑暗中，它的高度和大小也是别的树的近两倍。树向开阔的草地和小河倾斜着。他又在茂盛的树枝下站定，一动不动，倾听着。周围的声音毫无变化。困倦的猪发出微弱的咕噜声。他把手放在干燥、几乎有些温暖的树干上。粗糙并长满苔藓的表面一经他触摸，便散发出一股泥炭味。她会来吗——会吗？在这个被月光施了魔咒、神出鬼没、让人恐惧颤抖的树林间，他对一切都充满了怀疑！这儿的一切是那么神秘超然，不适合世俗的恋人。这儿只适合男神和女神、牧神和仙女，不适合他和这个乡下小姑娘。如果她不来，难道不几乎算上是一种解脱吗？但是，他还一直倾听着。叫不出名的鸟还在“噗——噗”“噗——噗”地叫着，有鳟鱼的小河急促地流动，月亮透过树枝搭成的栅栏，不时望几眼河面。和他视线齐平的花好像每时每刻都在变得更加生动，它美得神秘而洁白，好像愈来愈融为他焦虑心情的一部分了。他掐了一枝花，凑近来看——有三朵花。摘下果树的花朵——柔软、圣洁、娇嫩的花朵——然后扔掉，真是亵渎啊！接着，他突然听见大门关上的声音。猪再次惊起，咕噜着。他靠着树干，双手压在身后长了苔藓的树上，屏住了呼吸。她简直就像穿梭林间的精灵，即便她来时弄出了这么大的声响！接着，他看到她已经走得很近了——她那昏暗的身影已融为一棵小树的一部分，洁白的脸庞也融为树上花朵的一部分。她静静地往他这边探视着。他小声喊了声“梅甘”，并伸出手。她向前跑，径直扑到他的怀里。阿什赫斯特感到她的心贴着他怦怦跳动，他完全领会了骑士精神和激情的感觉。因为她不属于他的世界，因为她是那样单纯、年轻、直率、可爱且柔弱，在这黑暗里，他怎能不以她的保护者自居呢！因为她是那样单纯、自然和美丽，正如那有生命的花朵一样，是这春宵的一部分，他怎能不接受她给予的全部，不去满足她和他心中荡漾的春意呢！在这两种情感斗争中，他把她拥得更紧了，吻着她的发。他不知道他们一言不发地站在那儿多久了。小河依旧潺潺，猫头鹰依旧呜鸣，月亮悄然向上升起，变得更白了。他们周围和头上的苹果花也在这生机勃勃的美中存有的悬念下变得愈来愈明亮了。他们寻找着彼此的嘴唇，默默不语。此刻，言语会让这一切显得不真实！春天没有言语，只有悸动和细语。春花怒放，春叶茁壮，春水奔流，春天甜美地找寻着，无休无止。这一切都比言语要丰富得多！有时，春天也会拥有生命，像一个神秘的神灵一样站在那里，用手臂环抱着恋人，用有魔力的手指抚摸着他们。于是，他们就这样唇贴唇地站着，除了接吻，忘记了一切。当她的心贴着他怦怦跳着的时候，当她的唇在他的唇上颤抖的时候，阿什赫斯特只感到一阵简单的狂喜——命运之神把她送到了自己的怀里，爱神是不容蔑视的！但是，当他们的唇为了呼吸而分开的时候，分歧又再次显现。不过，欲望也更加强烈。他叹道：</td>
		<td class="en">It was nearly eleven that night when Ashurst put down the pocket ＠Odyssey＠ which for half an hour he had held in his hands without reading, and slipped through the yard down to the orchard.The moon had just risen, very golden, over the hill, and like a bright, powerful, watching spirit peered through the bars of an ash tree’s half-naked boughs.In among the apple trees it was still dark, and he stood making sure of his direction, feeling the rough grass with his feet.A black mass close behind him stirred with a heavy grunting sound, and three large pigs settled down again close to each other, under the wall.He listened.There was no wind, but the stream’s burbling whispering chuckle had gained twice its daytime strength.One bird, he could not tell what, cried “Pippip,” “Pip-pip,” with perfect monotony; he could hear a night-jar spinning very far off; an owl hooting.Ashurst moved a step or two, and again halted, aware of a dim living whiteness all round his head.On the dark unstirring trees innumerable flowers and buds all soft and blurred were being bewitched to life by the creeping moonlight.He had the oddest feeling of actual companionship, as if a million white moths or spirits had floated in and settled between dark sky and darker ground, and were opening and shutting their wings on a level with his eyes.In the bewildering, still, scentless beauty of that moment he almost lost memory of why he had come to the orchard.The flying glamour which had clothed the earth all day had not gone now that night had fallen, but only changed into this new form.He moved on through the thicket of stems and boughs covered with that live powdering whiteness, till he reached the big apple tree.No mistaking that, even in the dark, nearly twice the height and size of any other, and leaning out towards the open meadows and the stream.Under the thick branches he stood still again, to listen.The same sounds exactly, and a faint grunting from the sleepy pigs.He put his hands on the dry, almost warm tree trunk, whose rough mossy surface gave forth a peaty scent at his touch.Would she come—would she?And among these quivering, haunted, moon-witched trees he was seized with doubts of everything!All was unearthly here, fit for no earthly lovers; fit only for god and goddess, faun and nymph not for him and this little country girl.Would it not be almost a relief if she did not come?But all the time he was listening.And still that unknown bird went “Pip-pip,” “Pip-pip,” and there rose the busy chatter of the little trout stream, whereon the moon was flinging glances through the bars of her tree-prison.The blossom on a level with his eyes seemed to grow more living every moment, seemed with its mysterious white beauty more and more a part of his suspense.He plucked a fragment and held it close—three blossoms.Sacrilege to pluck fruit-tree blossom—soft, sacred, young blossom—and throw it away!Then suddenly he heard the gate close, the pigs stirring again and grunting; and leaning against the trunk, he pressed his hands to its mossy sides behind him, and held his breath.She might have been a spirit threading the trees, for all the noise she made!Then he saw her quite close—her dark form part of a little tree, her white face part of its blossom; so still, and peering towards him.He whispered: “Megan!” and held out his hands.She ran forward, straight to his breast.When he felt her heart beating against him, Ashurst knew to the full the sensations of chivalry and passion.Because she was not of his world, because she was so simple and young and headlong, adoring and defenceless, how could he be other than her protector, in the dark!Because she was all simple Nature and beauty, as much a part of this spring night as was the living blossom, how should he not take all that she would give him, how not fulfil the spring in her heart and his!And torn between these two emotions he clasped her close, and kissed her hair.How long they stood there without speaking he knew not.The stream went on chattering, the owls hooting, the moon kept stealing up and growing whiter; the blossom all round them and above brightened in suspense of living beauty.Their lips had sought each other’s, and they did not speak.The moment speech began all would be unreal!Spring has no speech, nothing but rustling and whispering.Spring has so much more than speech in its unfolding flowers and leaves, and the coursing of its streams, and in its sweet restless seeking!And sometimes spring will come alive, and, like a mysterious Presence stand, encircling lovers with its arms, laying on them the fingers of enchantment, so that, standing lips to lips, they forget everything but just a kiss.While her heart beat against him, and her lips quivered on his, Ashurst felt nothing but simple rapture—Destiny meant her for his arms, Love could not be flouted!But when their lips parted for breath, division began again at once.Only, passion now was so much the stronger, and he sighed:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But again Ashurst smiled and shook his head.Then suddenly he found himself being catechised about his physical achievements.He had rowed—it seemed—in his college boat, played in his college football team, won his college mile; and he rose from table a sort of hero.The two little girls insisted that he must see “their” cave, and they set forth chattering like magpies, Ashurst between them, Stella and her brother a little behind.In the cave, damp and darkish like any other cave, the great feature was a pool with possibility of creatures which might be caught and put into bottles.Sabina and Freda, who wore no stockings on their shapely brown legs, exhorted Ashurst to join them in the middle of it, and help sieve the water.He too was soon bootless and sockless.Time goes fast for one who has a sense of beauty, when there are pretty children in a pool and a young Diana on the edge, to receive with wonder anything you can catch!Ashurst never had much sense of time.It was a shock when, pulling out his watch, he saw it was well past three.No cashing his cheque to-day—the bank would be closed before he could get there.Watching his expression, the little girls cried out at once:</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在水池中玩腻了后，他们回了旅馆。阿什赫斯特给纳拉科姆太太发了一封电报：“对不起，今晚留在这里，明天回去。”梅甘肯定会理解他有太多事要做。他的心里轻松了一些。这是一个美妙的下午，温暖的日光、宁静的蓝色海洋，而游泳也正是他的一大爱好。美丽的小女孩们的夸奖让他得意洋洋。看着她们、斯特拉和哈特迪阳光的面孔，他感到心情舒畅。这似乎有一点儿不真实，然而一切却又再自然不过——好像是他与梅甘冒险私奔前，对正常生活的最后一瞥！他带上借来的泳衣，与她们一起出发了。他和哈利迪在一块岩石后换衣服，三个女孩在另一块岩石后换衣服。他第一个下水，奋力地游起来，以证明自己夸下的荣誉。他转身时，看见哈利迪正沿着岸边游着，女孩们骑着小浪花，笨拙地在水里翻腾。他向来看不起这种游法，不过现在觉得可爱又明智，因为这才能显示出他是唯一的游泳能手。不过，他一点点靠近时，却在想她们是否会乐意他这样一个陌生人加入她们的泼水小组。靠近那位苗条的仙女让他感到害羞。这时，萨比娜召呼他过去教她漂浮。这两个小女孩使他忙个不停，甚至没有时间注意斯特拉是否习惯他的在场，直到他突然听到她惊恐的叫声。水已经没过了她的腰，她的身体向前微倾，修长而白皙的胳膊伸开，指向前方，湿漉漉的脸由于阳光照射和害怕的表情而变得扭曲。</td>
		<td class="en">The attractions of the pool palling, they went back to the hotel.Ashurst sent his wire, addressing it to Mrs. Narracombe: “Sorry, detained for the night, back to-morrow.”Surely Megan would understand that he had too much to do; and his heart grew lighter.It was a lovely afternoon, warm, the sea calm and blue, and swimming his great passion; the favour of these pretty children flattered him, the pleasure of looking at them, at Stella, at Halliday’s sunny face; the slight unreality, yet extreme naturalness of it all—as of a last peep at normality before he took this plunge with Megan!He got his borrowed bathing dress, and they all set forth.Halliday and he undressed behind one rock, the three girls behind another.He was first into the sea, and at once swam out with the bravado of justifying his self-given reputation.When he turned he could see Halliday swimming along shore, and the girls flopping and dipping, and riding the little waves, in the way he was accustomed to despise, but now thought pretty and sensible, since it gave him the distinction of the only deep-water fish.But drawing near, he wondered if they would like him, a stranger, to come into their splashing group; he felt shy, approaching that slim nymph.Then Sabina summoned him to teach her to float, and between them the little girls kept him so busy that he had no time even to notice whether Stella was accustomed to his presence, till suddenly he heard a startled sound from her: she was standing submerged to the waist, leaning a little forward, her slim white arms stretched out and pointing, her wet face puckered by the sun and an expression of fear.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿什赫斯特立刻发现菲尔出事了。他在没过头顶的水中拍打着，挣扎着，大约离他们一百码远。他突然大叫一声，手臂扬起，沉了下去。阿什赫斯特看见斯特拉冲过去，大声叫起来：“斯特拉，快回来！快回来！”他快速游了出去。他从来没游得这么快过，在哈利迪第二次露出水面的时候正好游到了他身旁。他抽筋了，但抓住他并不困难，因为他没有挣扎。阿什赫斯特让那个女孩停下的时候，她就停下了。等菲尔一在水里站稳，她马上上前帮忙。到沙滩上之后，他俩坐在他的两旁，揉搓他的四肢，小女孩们则满脸惊恐地站在一旁。哈利迪很快就笑了。真是——他说——他真是糟糕，糟透了！如果弗兰克给他一只胳膊靠，他现在就可以自己穿衣服了。阿什赫斯特伸出一只胳膊让他靠。这时，他看到斯特拉的脸又湿又红，眼泪汪汪，完全没有了以前的沉静。他想：“我叫她斯特拉了！不知道她介不介意？”</td>
		<td class="en">Ashurst saw at once that Phil was not all right.He was splashing and struggling out of his depth, perhaps a hundred yards away; suddenly he gave a cry, threw up his arms, and went down.Ashurst saw the girl launch herself towards him, and crying out: “Go back, Stella! Go back！” He dashed out.He had never swum so fast, and reached Halliday just as he was coming up a second time.It was a case of cramp, but to get him in was not difficult, for he did not struggle.The girl, who had stopped where Ashurst told her to, helped as soon as he was in his depth, and once on the beach they sat down one on each side of him to rub his limbs, while the little ones stood by with scared faces.Halliday was soon smiling.It was—he said—rotten of him, absolutely rotten!If Frank would give him an arm, he could get to his clothes all right now.Ashurst gave him the arm, and as he did so caught sight of Stella’s face, wet and flushed and tearful, all broken up out of its calm; and he thought: ‘I called her Stella!Wonder if she minded?’</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在拐角处勉强能看见梅甘，她在前面很远的地方。他跑了几步，就停住了，走了起来。每靠近梅甘一步，他就离哈利迪一家远一些。他的步伐也愈加慢了起来。见她这一面会改变什么呢？怎样才能使到她身边去产生的结果显得不那么糟糕呢？因为一切已经很显然了——自从他遇到哈利迪一家后，他逐渐确信自己不愿娶梅甘。他们若结婚，将只会过一段疯狂的爱情生活，一段让人困扰、悔恨的艰难生活。接着，他就会厌倦，因为她会将一切都给他。她这么单纯，这么容易相信别人，这么像朝露。朝露——太容易消逝了！那个褪了色的小圆点——她的苏格兰圆帽——还在他前面的远处晃动着。她抬头瞧着每一个路人和每家的窗子。有哪个男人经历过这样残酷的时刻？不管他怎么做，他都觉得自己是个野兽。他发出一声痛苦的呻吟，使一位路过的护士转身盯着他看了看。他看见梅甘停下了，倚在海堤上，看着大海。他也停住了。她很可能从来没见过海，即使在痛苦的时刻也忍不住要观赏一下“是的，她什么都没见识过，”他想，“一切都在等着她。我会因为仅仅几个星期的热恋毁了她一生。我宁愿去上吊也不会做这种事！”突然，他似乎看见斯特拉沉静的目光正注视着他，风正拂动着她前额上那卷蓬松的头发。啊！这样做是疯狂的，将意味着放弃他尊重的一切和他的自尊。他转身快步向车站走去。但是，回忆中的那个可怜的、不知所措的小身影，还有那双在人群中焦急寻找的眼睛又狠狠地击打着他。他又转身往海边走去。</td>
		<td class="en">From the corner he could only just see Megan, a long way ahead now.He ran a few steps, checked himself, and dropped into a walk.With each step nearer to her, further from the Hallidays, he walked more and more slowly.How did it alter anything—this sight of her?How make the going to her, and that which must come of it, less ugly?For there was no hiding it—since he had met the Hallidays he had become gradually sure that he would not marry Megan.It would only be a wild love-time, a troubled, remorseful, difficult time—and then—well, then he would get tired, just because she gave him everything, was so simple, and so trustful, so dewy.And dew—wears off!The little spot of faded colour, her tam-o’-shanter cap, wavered on far in front of him; she was looking up into every face, and at the house windows.Had any man ever such a cruel moment to go through?Whatever he did, he felt he would be a beast.And he uttered a groan which made a nursemaid turn and stare.He saw Megan stop and lean against the sea-wall, looking at the sea; and he too stopped.Quite likely she had never seen the sea before, and even in her distress could not resist that sight.“Yes, she’s seen nothing,” he thought; “everything’s before her.And just for a few weeks’ passion, I shall be cutting her life to ribbons.I’d better go and hang myself rather than do it!”And suddenly he seemed to see Stella’s calm eyes looking into his, the wave of fluffy hair on her forehead stirred by the wind.Ah! it would be madness, would mean giving up all that he respected, and his own self-respect.He turned and walked quickly back towards the station.But memory of that poor, bewildered little figure, those anxious eyes searching the passers-by, smote him too hard again, and once more he turned towards the sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，他再也看不到那顶小帽子了。那个小小的有色圆点已经消失在中午的人流中了。当生活好像把什么东西卷走了，使你够不着时，人就会觉得缺少了什么。正是渴望的热情和这种缺乏驱使他匆忙向前走去。他找了半小时，可怎么也找不到她。然后，他脸朝下倒在了沙滩上。他知道要想找到她只有去车站。她寻找未果，就会回到车站坐车回家。或者他可以自己乘火车回农场。这样，她回家时就可以看到他了。但是，他无力地躺在沙滩上，周围是一群群漠不关心的孩子。他们正拿着铲子和小桶玩。对那个东寻西找、左右徘徊的小身影的怜悯已几乎淹没在他春情奔流的血液中了。因为现在，他心里全是狂野的感情了——以前充斥的骑士精神已经烟消云散了。他又开始渴望她，渴望她的吻，她柔软娇小的身体，她的放纵和她所有快速、热烈又不受礼教约束的情感。他渴望那个月夜在苹果树下那种美妙的感觉。他的渴望强烈得让人恐惧，就像农牧神渴望仙女一样。有鲑鱼的小溪闪着亮光，水快速地流动着。另外，还有绚目的金凤花、老“野人”出没的岩石堆、布谷鸟和啄木鸟的鸣啼、猫头鹰的叫声，还有红色的月亮透过天鹅绒般的黑云窥视这一片生机勃勃的洁白的苹果花。窗前是她的脸蛋，正为爱情而出神，他够不着她的脸。在那棵苹果树下，他们心贴心，她的嘴唇回应着他的嘴唇——他被这一切包围了。但是，他躺着一动不动。是什么抵抗了怜悯和这种热切的渴望，让他瘫倒在温暖的沙子中呢？是三个头发呈淡黄色的脑袋，还有一张长着亲切的蓝灰色眼睛的美丽面孔。她纤细的手按住他的手，快速地叫着他的名字说：“所以，你确实相信要行善吗？”是的，那种感觉就像在一座古老的英式内院花园里。这里种有石竹花、矢车菊和玫瑰，散发着薰衣草和丁香花的香气。这里美丽、天然、几近于神圣——他唯一能感受到的就是纯洁和美好。突然，他想：“她可能再回来沿着海岸找我，那她就会看见我了！”他起身，往远处沙滩另一头的岩石走去了。在那里，水沫溅在他的脸上，让他能更加冷静地思考了。回到农场，在树林中和岩石间爱梅甘，周围全是荒野和类似的环境——他知道这是不可能的！完全不可能！把她这样完全属于大自然的人移居到城市，养在小公寓或房间里——他诗人的气质不允许自己这样做。他的激情将只是一场感官的狂欢，很快就会消失。在伦敦，她的纯朴和文化教养的匮乏只会让她变为他的秘密玩偶——没别的可能。他坐在岩石上，两脚垂下摇晃着，下面是一个浅绿色的小水池，海水正从这里退去。他这样坐得时间越长，就越清楚地看到这一点。可是，她的胳膊和整个身体好像正在从他身上慢慢地，慢慢地滑落，掉入水池，被冲到大海里。她仰起脸看着他，那迷茫的脸色、哀求的目光和湿漉漉的黑发控制着他，萦绕着他，折磨着他！最后，他站起来，攀上低矮的石壁，来到一个隐蔽的小海湾。也许他在水中能重新找回自制力——赶走这阵狂热！他脱掉衣服，跳进海中游起来。他想让自己疲惫，这样一切都无所谓了。他不顾一切地游着，游得又快又远。接着，他突然间毫无理由地害怕起来。假设他再也不能回到岸边——假设水流将他冲走——假如他也像哈利迪那样抽筋！他往回游了。红色的岩石好像离他很远。如果他淹死了，人们会发现他的衣服。哈利迪一家会知道。但是，梅甘可能永远不会知道——农场没有报纸。菲尔·哈利迪的声音再次在他耳边响起：“我可能拥有的那个剑桥女孩，我很高兴没有想起她！”在他莫名恐惧的那一刻，他发誓自己不会去想梅甘。然后，他不害怕了。他很轻松地游了回去，在阳光下晾干身子，穿上了衣服。他感到心酸，但心不再痛了。他身上干了，感到神清气爽。</td>
		<td class="en">The cap was no longer visible; that little spot of colour had vanished in the stream of the noon promenaders.And impelled by the passion of longing, the dearth which comes on one when life seems to be whirling something out of reach, he hurried forward.She was nowhere to be seen; for half an hour he looked for her; then on the beach flung himself face downward in the sand.To find her again he knew he had only to go to the station and wait till she returned from her fruitless quest, to take her train home; or to take train himself and go back to the farm, so that she found him there when she returned.But he lay inert in the sand, among the indifferent groups of children with their spades and buckets.Pity at her little figure wandering, seeking, was well-nigh merged in the spring-running of his blood; for it was all wild feeling now—the chivalrous part, what there had been of it, was gone.He wanted her again, wanted her kisses, her soft, little body, her abandonment, all her quick, warm, pagan emotion; wanted the wonderful feeling of that night under the moonlit apple boughs; wanted it all with a horrible intensity, as the faun wants the nymph.The quick chatter of the little bright trout-stream, the dazzle of the buttercups, the rocks of the old “wild men”; the calling of the cuckoos and yaffles, the hooting of the owls; and the red moon peeping out of the velvet dark at the living whiteness of the blossom; and her face just out of reach at the window, lost in its love-look; and her heart against his, her lips answering his, under the apple tree—all this besieged him.Yet he lay inert.What was it which struggled against pity and this feverish longing, and kept him there paralysed in the warm sand?Three flaxen heads—a fair face with friendly blue-grey eyes, a slim hand pressing his, a quick voice speaking his name—“So you do believe in being good?”Yes, and a sort of atmosphere as of some old walled-in English garden, with pinks, and cornflowers, and roses, and scents of lavender and lilaccool and fair, untouched, almost holy—all that he had been brought up to feel was clean and good.And suddenly he thought: “she might come along the front again and see me!” and he got up and made his way to the rock at the far end of the beach.There, with the spray biting into his face, he could think more coolly.To go back to the farm and love Megan out in the woods, among the rocks, with everything around wild and fitting—that, he knew, was impossible, utterly.To transplant her to a great town, to keep, in some little flat or rooms, one who belonged so wholly to Nature—the poet in him shrank from it.His passion would be a mere sensuous revel, soon gone; in London, her very simplicity, her lack of all intellectual quality, would make her his secret plaything—nothing else.The longer he sat on the rock, with his feet dangling over a greenish pool from which the sea was ebbing, the more clearly he saw this; but it was as if her arms and all of her were slipping slowly, slowly down from him, into the pool, to be carried away out to sea; and her face looking up, her lost face with beseeching eyes, and dark, wet hair possessed, haunted, tortured him!He got up at last, scaled the low rock-cliff, and made his way down into a sheltered cove.Perhaps in the sea he could get back his control—lose this fever!And stripping off his clothes, he swam out.He wanted to tire himself so that nothing mattered and swam recklessly, fast and far; then suddenly, for no reason, felt afraid.Suppose he could not reach shore again—suppose the current set him out—or he got cramp, like Halliday!He turned to swim in.The red cliffs looked a long way off.If he were drowned they would find his clothes.The Hallidays would know; but Megan perhaps never—they took no newspaper at the farm.And Phil Halliday’s words came back to him again: “A girl at Cambridge I might have. Glad I haven’t got her on my mind!”And in that moment of unreasoning fear he vowed he would not have her on his mind.Then his fear left him; he swam in easily enough, dried himself in the sun, and put on his clothes.His heart felt sore, but no longer ached; his body cool and refreshed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对像阿什赫斯特这样的年轻人来说，怜悯并不是一种强烈的情感。他回到哈利迪家的起居室，狼吞虎咽地吃了一顿茶点，感觉自己很像刚从高烧中恢复过来。一切都看起来崭新而清晰。茶、奶油吐司和果酱的味道都出奇得好，烟草也从来没有现在这么香过。他在空荡荡的房间中走来走去，停下来看看这个，摸摸那个。他拿起斯特拉的针线篮，触摸着棉线筒和一根色彩艳丽的丝织辫线，闻着装满车叶草的小香袋，香袋是她放在篮子中的。他坐在钢琴边，用一根手指弹着旋律，想着：“今晚她还会演奏。我要看着她弹，看着她让我舒服。”她之前放在他身边的那本书还在那儿。他拿起书，试图读一读。但是，梅甘小小的、悲伤的身影又立刻浮现到他脑海中。他起身，靠在窗边，听着新月形旅馆花园里画眉的鸣啼，看着树林下梦幻般的蓝色大海。一位侍者进来，将茶收走了。他依然站着，呼吸着夜晚的空气，竭力控制自己不去想。然后，他看见哈利迪一家从新月形旅馆的门进来。他们提着篮子，斯特拉稍稍走在菲尔和两个孩子前面。他本能地向后退。他的心酸痛而烦乱，害怕见到他们，却又渴望见面带来的亲切的慰藉——他既对这种影响怀有敌意，又渴求这种影响的清爽和无邪，还有看着斯特拉脸庞的愉悦感。他倚在钢琴后面的墙上，看见她走进来，站在那儿，神色有些落寞，好像有些失望似的。然后，她瞧见他了，微笑起来。这迅速灿烂的一笑让阿什赫斯特感到既温暖又恼火。</td>
		<td class="en">When one is as young as Ashurst, pity is not a violent emotion.And, back in the Hallidays’ sitting-room, eating a ravenous tea, he felt much like a man recovered from fever.Everything seemed new and clear; the tea, the buttered toast and jam tasted absurdly good; tobacco had never smelt so nice.And walking up and down the empty room, he stopped here and there to touch or look.He took up Stella’s work-basket, fingered the cotton reels and a gaily-coloured plait of sewing silks, smelt at the little bag filled with woodruff she kept among them.He sat down at the piano, playing tunes with one finger, thinking: “To-night she’ll play; I shall watch her while she’s playing; it does me good to watch her.”He took up the book, which still lay where she had placed it beside him, and tried to read.But Megan’s little, sad figure began to come back at once, and he got up and leaned in the window, listening to the thrushes in the Crescent gardens, gazing at the sea, dreamy and blue below the trees.A servant came in and cleared the tea away, and he still stood, inhaling the evening air, trying not to think.Then he saw the Hallidays coming through the gate of the Crescent, Stella a little in front of Phil and the children, with their baskets, and instinctively he drew back.His heart, too sore and discomfited, shrank from this encounter, yet wanted its friendly solace—bore a grudge against this influence, yet craved its cool innocence, and the pleasure of watching Stella’s face.From against the wall behind the piano he saw her come in and stand looking a little blank as though disappointed; then she saw him and smiled, a swift, brilliant smile which warmed yet irritated Ashurst.</td></tr>
