"手稿中的魔鬼","The Devil in Manuscript"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne "
"一个腊月寒冬的晚上，我乘坐邮车来到了一个大城镇，当时我的一位知己就住在这个镇上。有些年轻人才华横溢，怡情于诗词歌赋和纯文学，却自称是法学学生，我的朋友就是这样一个人。晚饭后，我第一件事就是在他那位德高望重的导师的办公室里与他见面。就像我刚才说的那样，那晚寒气逼人，虽然星光明亮，却冷得像在新地岛——街边的橱窗覆盖了一层霜，几乎把橱窗里的灯光都遮住了；地面和石子铺的道路上都被冻得硬邦邦的，马车的车轮在上面驶过，发出同样响亮的轰隆声。无论是地面上还是屋顶上，都没有积雪。狂风肆虐，我不得不把我的斗篷扬起，犹如一面主帆；我坐的马车以每小时10海里的速度疾驰，过往的其他“领航员”无不艳羡万分；他们逆风缓慢前行，任狂风在他们的齿间横行。其中有辆车被我的马车撞翻了，但甚至还没等那车夫骂出声来，他的车就已经被风之翼刮跑了。","On a bitter evening of December, I arrived by mail in a large town, which was then the residence of an intimate friend, one of those gifted youths who cultivate poetry and the belles-lettres, and call themselves students at law.My first business, after supper, was to visit him at the office of his distinguished instructor.As I have said, it was a bitter night, clear starlight, but cold as Nova Zembla,—the shop-windows along the street being frosted, so as almost to hide the lights, while the wheels of coaches thundered equally loud over frozen earth and pavements of stone.There was no snow, either on the ground or the roofs of the houses.The wind blew so violently, that I had but to spread my cloak like a mainsail, and scud along the street at the rate of ten knots, greatly envied by other navigators, who were beating slowly up, with the gale right in their teeth.One of these I capsized, but was gone on the wings of the wind before he could even vociferate an oath."
"看过这幕寒夜景象之后，你再看我们坐在熊熊燃烧的火炉边；炉中的火焰看上去是那样温馨怡人，我忍不住想躺上去，在那些滚烫的煤块上打几个滚。我们周围摆设的是那种律师办公室中常用的家具。一排排的羊皮书卷、无数的令状、传票和其他法律文件凌乱地堆放在书桌和餐桌上。但屋里某些东西似乎在暗示我们，不必担心被任何人打扰，无论是客户还是那位博学的律师本人——此时，他的确正在某个遥远的城镇出庭打官司。在餐桌上的两只平底无脚酒杯中间，立着一只高高的细颈瓶。瓶子旁有一沓沾有墨迹的手稿，这些手稿看起来跟我们平时在法庭上见到的任何法律文件都截然不同。我的朋友，我叫他奥伯伦——这种称呼体现了一种想象力，也体现了我和他之间的交情——我的朋友奥伯伦正盯着这些文件，露出焦虑不安的古怪神情。","After this picture of an inclement night, behold us seated by a great blazing fire, which looked so comfortable and delicious that I felt inclined to lie down and roll among the hot coals.The usual furniture of a lawyer’s office was around us,—rows of volumes in sheepskin, and a multitude of writs, summonses, and other legal papers, scattered over the desks and tables.But there were certain objects which seemed to intimate that we had little dread of the intrusion of clients, or of the learned counsellor himself, who, indeed, was attending court in a distant town.A tall, decanter-shaped bottle stood on the table, between two tumblers, and beside a pile of blotted manuscripts, altogether dissimilar to any law documents recognized in our courts.My friend, whom I shall call Oberon,—it was a name of fancy and friendship between him and me,—my friend Oberon looked at these papers with a peculiar expression of disquietude."
"“我敢肯定，”他冷静地说，“或者至少可以说，这堆沾了墨水的文件里有个魔鬼。你已经读过了，应该知道我的意思——我力求刻画好一个魔鬼的形象，就像在我们的文化传统和巫术故事里记载的那样。天啊，我甚至被我自己脑袋里创作的东西给吓着了。这部稿子让我想起来就发抖，因为一种罪恶的思想通过稿子获得了某种实体的存在！我真不想再看见它们了！”","“I do believe,” said he, soberly, “or, at least, I could believe, if I chose, that there is a devil in this pile of blotted papers.You have read them, and know what I mean,—that conception in which I endeavored to embody the character of a fiend, as represented in our traditions and the written records of witchcraft.Oh, I have a horror of what was created in my own brain, and shudder at the manuscripts in which I gave that dark idea a sort of material existence!Would they were out of my sight!”"
"“我也不想看见。”我想。","“And of mine, too,” thought I."
"“你还记得吗，”奥伯伦接着说，“这个邪恶的家伙是怎样夺走了别人的幸福，而那些人不过是稍作妥协，几乎一点儿恶意都没有，却落入了他的魔掌。由此我就不得安宁，这全都是因为这该死的手稿。你难道没有同感？”","“You remember,” continued Oberon, “how the hellish thing used to suck away the happiness of those who, by a simple concession that seemed almost innocent, subjected themselves to his power.Just so my peace is gone, and all by these accursed manuscripts.Have you felt nothing of the same influence?”"
"“没有，”我回答道，“倒是在读完你那些可爱的小故事之后，我似乎着了魔，想当个小说家。”","“Nothing,” replied I, “unless the spell be hid in a desire to turn novelist, after reading your delightful tales.”"
"“当小说家！”奥伯伦半开玩笑地惊叫道，“这么说，我的魔鬼已经把他的魔爪按在你头上了！你完了！你甚至连祈求神明解救的机会都不会有了！但我俩将是最后的、也是唯一的受害者；因为今天晚上我决定烧掉这些手稿，让这魔鬼在烈火中受惩罚去吧。”","“Novelist!” exclaimed Oberon, half seriously.“Then, indeed, my devil has his claw on you!You are gone!You cannot even pray for deliverance!But we will be the last and only victims; for this night I mean to burn the manuscripts, and commit the fiend to his retribution in the flames.”"
"“烧掉你的故事！”我重复着，被他这个绝望的主意惊呆了。","“Burn your tales!” repeated I, startled at the desperation of the idea."
"“即便如此，”他垂头丧气地说，“你也想象不到这些故事给了我什么样的影响。我变得追求虚妄，不顾现实的名誉。我周围全是幻影，它们模仿现实的生活，弄得我神魂颠倒、不知所措。它们把我拖离这世上的传统老路，把我引向一个陌生孤寂的地方——一种身处人群中的孤寂——在那儿，没有人在乎我做什么，也没有人会像我这样思考或感受。一切都是这些故事造成的。等它们化成灰烬，或许我就能回到原来的状态了。而且，烧掉它们这种牺牲或许并没有你料想得大，因为谁也不会想出版它们。”","“Even so,” said the author, despondingly.“You cannot conceive what an effect the composition of these tales has had on me.I have become ambitious of a bubble, and careless of solid reputation.I am surrounding myself with shadows, which bewilder me, by aping the realities of life.They have drawn me aside from the beaten path of the world, and led me into a strange sort of solitude,—a solitude in the midst of men,—where nobody wishes for what I do, nor thinks nor feels as I do.The tales have done all this.When they are ashes, perhaps I shall be as I was before they had existence.Moreover, the sacrifice is less than you may suppose, since nobody will publish them.”"
"“这确实是个问题。”我说道。","“That does make a difference, indeed,” said I."
"“我曾经给大概17个书商写信投稿，”奥伯伦气得满脸通红，接着说道，“如果你读了这些人的回信准会气得直瞪眼；你还真该看看它们，可惜这种信我一般一到手就烧掉。有一个书商只出版学校教材，另外一个手头有五本小说正在审阅。”","“They have been offered, by letter,” continued Oberon, reddening with vexation, “to some seventeen booksellers.It would make you stare to read their answers; and read them you should, only that I burnt them as fast as they arrived.One man publishes nothing but school-books; another has five novels already under examination.”"
"“美国没出版的文学作品多得数不清了吧！”我叫道。","“What a voluminous mass the unpublished literature of America must be!” cried I."
"“哦！就是全亚历山大城的手稿都没有那么多！”我的朋友说，“啊，还有另外一位先生说他刚刚离开了这一行，我肯定他是故意的，他就是不想出版我的书。不过，还有几位并没有完全拒绝出我的书，条件是我要先预付一半出版费用，余下的部分我拿债券来抵，而且不管书卖不卖得出去，都要让他们拿大头。还有一位建议让我自己交订购费。”","“Oh, the Alexandrian manuscripts were nothing to it!” said my friend.“Well, another gentleman is just giving up business, on purpose, I verily believe, to escape publishing my book.Several, however, would not absolutely decline the agency, on my advancing half the cost of an edition, and giving bonds for the remainder, besides a high percentage to themselves, whether the book sells or not.Another advises a subscription.”"
"“这帮恶棍！”我叫道。","“The villain!” exclaimed I."
"“确实如此！”奥伯伦说道，“总之，在这17个书商里，实际上只有一个答应读一下我的故事，而他——自己对文学不过是浅尝辄止，这点我能看出来——却对我的作品大放厥词，建议我大幅修改。一番笼统含糊的指责之后，他信誓旦旦地保证不会再跟我谈任何条件。”","“A fact!” said Oberon.“In short, of all the seventeen booksellers, only one has vouchsafed even to read my tales; and he—a literary dabbler himself, I should judge—has the impertinence to criticise them, proposing what he calls vast improvements, and concluding, after a general sentence of condemnation, with the definitive assurance that he will not be concerned on any terms.”"
"“真该把那家伙的鼻子拧下来。”我说道。","“It might not be amiss to pull that fellow’s nose,” remarked I."
"“如果这个‘行当’共用一个鼻子，拧起来倒还过瘾。”这位作者答道，“但这17个无耻之徒里边倒还有个诚实的家伙。他很明白地告诉我，没有任何一个美国出版商愿意掺和美国作品——作者若是很有名气，他们或许还会考虑；若是新手，则肯定会被拒之门外，除非作者愿意自担风险。”","“If the whole ‘trade’ had one common nose, there would be some satisfaction in pulling it,” answered the author.“But, there does seem to be one honest man among these seventeen unrighteous ones; and he tells me fairly, that no American publisher will meddle with an American work,—seldom if by a known writer, and never if by a new one,—unless at the writer’s risk.”"
"“这帮无赖！”我叫道，“他们靠文学吃饭，却不想为此承担任何风险？但是话说回来，虽然得自掏腰包，但至少还是能出版的嘛。“","“The paltry rogues!” cried I.“Will they live by literature, and yet risk nothing for its sake?But, after all, you might publish on your own account.”"
"“本来是可以的，”奥伯伦回答道，“但这事邪门就邪门在这儿。这些人害得我也开始嫌弃这些故事了，只要想一想它们，我就心生厌恶。每当瞥见它们躺在桌子上，我竟然会觉得胃里有点儿恶心。告诉你，这里边真藏着一个魔鬼！若是能把它们扔进火堆，那我肯定狂喜不已，就如同向敌人复了仇，或是毁掉有害的东西一样让我感觉很开心。”","“And so I might,” replied Oberon.“But the devil of the business is this.These people have put me so out of conceit with the tales, that I loathe the very thought of them, and actually experience a physical sickness of the stomach, whenever I glance at them on the table.I tell you there is a demon in them!I anticipate a wild enjoyment in seeing them in the blaze; such as I should feel in taking vengeance on an enemy, or destroying something noxious.”"
"对于他这个决心，我并没有拼命反对，尽管我有心偏袒作者，但私下里还是觉得，他的作品扔到火里，会比放在别的任何一个地方都更为绚丽。在执行判决前，我们打开一瓶香槟，那是奥伯伦为自己准备的，为的是在做这个悲伤之举前好提提神。我们每人吞掉了满满一杯噗噗冒泡的香槟。那液体顺着我们的喉咙汩汩流下，立马使我的眼睛亮了起来，然而我的朋友依然忧心忡忡、愁容不展，和之前没什么两样。他把那些稿子揽到面前，满怀深情又饱含厌恶，就像一位父亲把一个残疾的婴儿抱入怀中。","I did not very strenuously oppose this determination, being privately of opinion, in spite of my partiality for the author, that his tales would make a more brilliant appearance in the fire than anywhere else.Before proceeding to execution, we broached the bottle of champagne, which Oberon had provided for keeping up his spirits in this doleful business.We swallowed each a tumblerful, in sparkling commotion; it went bubbling down our throats, and brightened my eyes at once, but left my friend sad and heavy as before.He drew the tales towards him, with a mixture of natural affection and natural disgust, like a father taking a deformed infant into his arms."
"“呸！哼！啐！”他大叫着，把稿纸举到与自己一臂之遥的位置。“格雷认为，所谓天堂，就是懒洋洋地躺在沙发上，读读新小说。如今，对付那些在笔下胡编乱造的家伙，除了强迫他们一页一页不停地读自己写的糟粕，恐怕但丁也想不出什么更好的惩罚了吧？”","“Pooh! Pish! Pshaw!” exclaimed he, holding them at arm’s length.“It was Gray’s idea of heaven, to lounge on a sofa and read new novels.Now, what more appropriate torture would Dante himself have contrived, for the sinner who perpetrates a bad book, than to be continually turning over the manuscript?”"
"“这不管用，”我说，“因为不入流的作家总是擅长自我欣赏。”","“It would fail of effect,” said I, “because a bad author is always his own great admirer.”"
"“我正好缺少这一点——这也是我们这类文人唯一的优点。”奥伯伦说，“可只要我翻开这一页页稿纸，数不清的回忆便纷至沓来！十月的一个晚上，天空中繁星点点，我走在一条山路上，脑海里突然出现这么一幅画面：在纯净又提神的空气中，我化成了灵魂，感觉自己仿佛可以升向天空，沿着银河赛跑。还有另一个故事，那是三月一个漆黑沉寂的夜晚，我乘着马车行驶在路上。车轮声和同伴的说话声渐行渐远，就像是梦境一般，而我的幻觉却变成了鲜明的现实。那潦草写下的字里行间描绘了种种影子，到了半夜我会把它们召唤到床前，但我要它们离开的时候，它们却拒绝服从；天蒙蒙亮了，而我依然神智清醒，发着高烧，我让自己着了魔！”","“I lack that one characteristic of my tribe,—the only desirable one,” observed Oberon.“But how many recollections throng upon me, as I turn over these leaves!This scene came into my fancy as I walked along a hilly road, on a starlight October evening; in the pure and bracing air, I became all soul, and felt as if I could climb the sky, and run a race along the Milky Way.Here is another tale, in which I wrapt myself during a dark and dreary night-ride in the month of March, till the rattling of the wheels and the voices of my companions seemed like faint sounds of a dream, and my visions a bright reality.That scribbled page describes shadows which I summoned to my bedside at midnight: they would not depart when I bade them; the gray dawn came, and found me wide awake and feverish, the victim of my own enchantments!”"
"“这其中定有某种乐趣让你沉迷。”我说道，纠结于一种莫名其妙的渴望，渴望自己的话可以得到印证。","“There must have been a sort of happiness in all this,” said I, smitten with a strange longing to make proof of it."
"“发烧本身或许存有某种乐趣。”作者回答道，“写作时萌生的种种情绪亦大有乐趣！有时候，我的思绪就像是埋藏在地下的宝石，需要费力气挖出来，再花心思小心地打磨、抛光。但经常会发生这种情况：思绪的甘泉突然喷涌而出，在纸页上汩汩流淌，就像是沙漠中突现清冽的泉水。然而当这小溪流尽，我唯有绝望地咬着笔杆，或是心灰意冷地蹒跚而行，就好像我和我的题目间有一道厚厚的冰墙。”","“There may be happiness in a fever fit,” replied the author.“And then the various moods in which I wrote!Sometimes my ideas were like precious stones under the earth, requiring toil to dig them up, and care to polish and brighten them; but often a delicious stream of thought would gush out upon the page at once, like water sparkling up suddenly in the desert; and when it had passed, I gnawed my pen hopelessly, or blundered on with cold and miserable toil, as if there were a wall of ice between me and my subject.”"
"“那么你知道，自己激情冷却时写出来的东西和你激情四射、思如泉涌时写出来的东西之间，有什么差别呢？”我问道。","“Do you now perceive a corresponding difference,” inquired I, “between the passages which you wrote so coldly, and those fervid flashes of the mind?”"
"“没有，”奥伯伦回答说，一边将手稿扔到桌子上，“我看不出哪些地方是我激情燃烧的妙笔。我那神奇的金银财宝如今已经变成了一文不值的糟粕。我的画作似乎用最可爱的色彩绘成，最后呈现出来的却是褪了色的、平淡无奇的玩意儿。梦境里我可以妙语连珠，可以诗情横溢，可以诙谐幽默——可是看呀！一旦我醒了，说的就全是废话。”","“No,” said Oberon, tossing the manuscripts on the table.“I find no traces of the golden pen with which I wrote in characters of fire.My treasure of fairy coin is changed to worthless dross.My picture, painted in what seemed the loveliest hues, presents nothing but a faded and indistinguishable surface.I have been eloquent and poetical and humorous in a dream,—and behold! it is all nonsense, now that I am awake.”"
"我的朋友往火炉里扔了几根木头和干柴，看着火苗像尼布甲尼撒熔炉里的火焰那样高高窜起来，他一把抓起香槟酒瓶，一气喝了满满的两大杯或者三大杯。酒劲连同内心的焦躁让他勃然大怒。他粗暴地抓起故事手稿。一瞬间，这些手稿就会在这熊熊燃烧的炼狱中消失殆尽，它们的瑕疵和美丽将一并不复存在。但突然之间，我想起了故事里充满想象力的段落、深沉的情感、新颖的思想，以及各种各样的出色之处。我猛然意识到，烧毁它们将是一个巨大的牺牲。我一把抓住了他的胳膊。","My friend now threw sticks of wood and dry chips upon the fire, and seeing it blaze like Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace, seized the champagne bottle, and drank two or three brimming bumpers, successively.The heady liquor combined with his agitation to throw him into a species of rage.He laid violent hands on the tales.In one instant more, their faults and beauties would alike have vanished in a glowing purgatory.But, all at once, I remembered passages of high imagination, deep pathos, original thoughts, and points of such varied excellence, that the vastness of the sacrifice struck me most forcibly.I caught his arm."
"“你不会真的要把它们烧了吧！”我惊叫道。","“Surely, you do not mean to burn them!” I exclaimed."
"“别管我！”奥伯伦叫道，他的眼中闪着怒火，“我要把它们烧了！任何一个烤焦的字符都不会放过！你想让我做个被诅咒的作家吗？——让我遭人耻笑、嘲弄、辱骂、冷眼漠视，或是让人抱着可怜我的想法，违背心意地用几句干巴巴的好话安慰我！难道为了与我自己的想法背道而驰的东西，让我成为众人唏嘘相向的笑柄！为了躲避死亡而四处流浪——而我的骨灰还是会在众人不经意的脚步下四散飞扬、七零八落，一辈子被人看低，就是死了也还是被人轻贱！难道我要忍受这一切吗？明知道那边的火焰能救我脱离苦海。不！再见吧，故事！要是我想再次提笔写作，就让我的手枯萎吧！”","“Let me alone!” cried Oberon, his eyes flashing fire.“I will burn them!Not a scorched syllable shall escape!Would you have me a damned author?—To undergo sneers, taunts, abuse, and cold neglect, and faint praise, bestowed, for pity’s sake, against the giver’s conscience!A hissing and a laughing-stock to my own traitorous thoughts!An outlaw from the protection of the grave,—one whose ashes every careless foot might spurn, unhonored in life, and remembered scornfully in death!Am I to bear all this, when yonder fire will insure me from the whole?No!There go the tales!May my hand wither when it would write another!”"
"他说到做到。他把手稿扔到炉中火焰最盛的地方，一开始火苗似乎还躲闪退让了一阵，但很快便将手稿团团围住，将它们变成了自己熊熊火光的一部分。奥伯伦站在那里，凝视着燃烧的火苗，继而发疯般地开始自言自语，似乎他在逼迫自己的想象力登上火葬堆，可他的想象力拒绝这样做，并变得狂暴起来。他嘴里念念有词，仿佛在自己宝贵思想的指引下，他能看得清火里燃烧的东西。或许作家的魔力将成千上万幻象注入纸页之中，而他能在这些炽热的火焰中辨认出它们。这些手稿在魂飞魄散前发出耀眼的光芒，股股浓烟腾起，片片火焰跳跃，加上燃烧得红里透白的煤块，所有这一切构成了一幅变幻多姿的景象。","The deed was done.He had thrown the manuscripts into the hottest of the fire, which at first seemed to shrink away, but soon curled around them, and made them a part of its own fervent brightness.Oberon stood gazing at the conflagration, and shortly began to soliloquize, in the wildest strain, as if Fancy resisted and became riotous, at the moment when he would have compelled her to ascend that funeral pile.His words described objects which he appeared to discern in the fire, fed by his own precious thoughts; perhaps the thousand visions which the writer’s magic had incorporated with these pages became visible to him in the dissolving heat, brightening forth ere they vanished forever; while the smoke, the vivid sheets of flame, the ruddy and whitening coals, caught the aspect of a varied scenery."
"“它们燃烧的样子，”他说，“就仿佛是我为它们注入了天才最旺盛的精神。我可以在火光中看见我的情人们相互依偎。从她们燃烧的心中升起的火焰是多么纯洁！那边还有一张恶棍的脸，它在火焰中痛苦地扭曲，永世忍受烈火的折磨。我笔下那些圣洁的男人和天使般虔诚的女人，他们像殉道者一样站在火焰中央，目光温和，一直望向天堂的方向。丧钟响起来吧！这座城着火了。看啊！——毁灭正呼啸着穿过我的黑暗森林，同时湖面沸腾着、翻滚着，群山变成了火山，天空被火红的烈焰点燃！大自然中的万物成了一片火海！哈！这个魔鬼！”","“They blaze,” said he, “as if I had steeped them in the intensest spirit of genius.There I see my lovers clasped in each other’s arms.How pure the flame that bursts from their glowing hearts!And yonder the features of a villain writhing in the fire that shall torment him to eternity.My holy men, my pious and angelic women, stand like martyrs amid the flames, their mild eyes lifted heavenward.Ring out the bells!A city is on fire.See!—destruction roars through my dark forests, while the lakes boil up in steaming billows, and the mountains are volcanoes, and the sky kindles with a lurid brightness!All elements are but one pervading flame!Ha! The fiend!”"
"我有些被他最后的这声喊叫吓到了。手稿差不多烧光了，但就在这时，又一股火苗窜了出来，它噼啪作响，像是有人在笑。跳跃的火苗让整个屋子和它一起舞蹈，继而又呼啸着窜进了烟囱里。","I was somewhat startled by this latter exclamation.The tales were almost consumed, but just then threw forth a broad sheet of fire, which flickered as with laughter, making the whole room dance in its brightness, and then roared portentously up the chimney."
"“你看到他了吗？你一定看到他了！”奥伯伦叫道，“他在最后一簇火苗里，大笑着瞪着我，他那张脸和我想象中的一模一样！好啦！所有故事都没啦。”","“You saw him?You must have seen him!” cried Oberon.“How he glared at me and laughed, in that last sheet of flame, with just the features that I imagined for him!Well! The tales are gone.”"
"确实，手稿已经化为一堆黑色的灰烬，数不清的火星在其间慌乱地闪动，笔迹如今已经变为道道白线，这团纸灰在阵阵气流的作用下，来回飞舞。焚烧者跪在地板上看着这堆灰烬。","The papers were indeed reduced to a heap of black cinders, with a multitude of sparks hurrying confusedly among them, the traces of the pen being now represented by white lines, and the whole mass fluttering to and fro in the draughts of air.The destroyer knelt down to look at them."
"“还有什么比火更厉害！”他说道，语调沮丧低沉，“即使是看不见、摸不着的思想也逃脱不了。就这么短短的一会儿功夫，它就摧毁了我历经那么多日夜创造出来的东西。我可能再也创造不出这么鲜活生动的东西了，如同我不能起死回生，将尸骨还魂。我还把自己头脑中未出生的孩子也一同葬送了。我过去创造的一切——连同我为未来计划的一切——就在这普普通通的一把火中毁灭了，只剩下了这堆灰烬！这么做是我命中注定的。还剩下什么呢？只剩一条疲倦、没有目标的生命——一生为这一刻而懊悔，等到生命完结，被埋在一座不起眼的坟墓里，再也不被人记起！”","“What is more potent than fire!” said he, in his gloomiest tone.“Even thought, invisible and incorporeal as it is, cannot escape it.In this little time, it has annihilated the creations of long nights and days, which I could no more reproduce, in their first glow and freshness, than cause ashes and whitened bones to rise up and live.There, too, I sacrificed the unborn children of my mind.All that I had accomplished—all that I planned for future years—has perished by one common ruin, and left only this heap of embers!The deed has been my fate.And what remains?A weary and aimless life,—a long repentance of this hour,—and at last an obscure grave, where they will bury and forget me!”"
"作者结束了他哀戚的悲叹。这时，熄灭的火堆又燃烧了起来，然后再熄灭、再燃烧，最后飞升上烟囱，像个挥着黑色翅膀的魔鬼。就在它完全熄灭之际，楼下的街上有个人大喊了一声：“着火了！”着火了！这可怕的叫喊立马引来其他人的喊叫，很快，大家全都叫了起来。奥伯伦噌地站了起来，再一次激动不已。","As the author concluded his dolorous moan, the extinguished embers arose and settled down and arose again, and finally flew up the chimney, like a demon with sable wings.Just as they disappeared, there was a loud and solitary cry in the street below us.“Fire!”Fire!Other voices caught up that terrible word, and it speedily became the shout of a multitude.Oberon started to his feet, in fresh excitement."
"“在这样的晚上起火！”他叫道，“风刮得这么猛烈，大火所到之处，屋顶都会像火药一样烧得不亦乐乎。所有的水泵都冻住了，就算是沸水，一从救火车里喷出，也会变成冰柱。只消一个时辰，这座木头搭建的小镇就会变成一个巨大的篝火堆。多么壮观的场景！为了我的下一个——呸！”","“A fire on such a night!” cried he.“The wind blows a gale, and wherever it whirls the flames, the roofs will flash up like gunpowder.Every pump is frozen up, and boiling water would turn to ice the moment it was flung from the engine.In an hour, this wooden town will be one great bonfire!What a glorious scene for my next—Pshaw!”"
"整个街道脚步声乱作一团，空中回荡着喊叫声。我们听到一辆救火车呼啸着拐过街角，另一辆从远处辘辘驶来。三座教堂塔尖上的钟一同响起，将警报声传遍相邻的各个城镇，表达出匆忙、混乱和恐惧之意；这钟声是那么不同寻常，使我几乎能从这钟声中听出全世界都在呐喊的副歌——“着火啦！着火啦！着火啦！”","The street was now all alive with footsteps, and the air full of voices.We heard one engine thundering round a corner, and another rattling from a distance over the pavements.The bells of three steeples clanged out at once, spreading the alarm to many a neighboring town, and expressing hurry, confusion, and terror, so inimitably that I could almost distinguish in their peal the burden of the universal cry,—“Fire! Fire! Fire!”"
"“什么能比这铁舌头更善雄辩！”奥伯伦叫道，“我的心在狂跳，在颤抖，但不是因为恐惧。而是因为另一种声音——它像一架巨大的风琴发出的声音一样低沉、可怕——是楼下街道上人群的吼叫和呐喊声。来吧！我们快没时间了。我要发出最响亮的呐喊，我要把我的灵魂和最狂野的混乱掺杂在一起，我要做酵母顶端的一个气泡！”","“What is so eloquent as their iron tongues!” exclaimed Oberon.“My heart leaps and trembles, but not with fear.And that other sound, too,—deep and awful as a mighty organ,—the roar and thunder of the multitude on the pavement below!Come!We are losing time.I will cry out in the loudest of the uproar, and mingle my spirit with the wildest of the confusion, and be a bubble on the top of the ferment!”"
"从第一声叫喊开始，我就预感到这场恐慌的真正目标是什么，中心在哪里。此时，什么都没有了，只有遍及我们头顶、脚下以及四周的嘈杂；公共楼梯上跌跌撞撞的脚步声、焦急的呼喊声、沉重的撞门声、救火车喷水的哗哗声，以及家具被扔到人行道上的撞击声。突然，我的朋友明白了事情的真相。他的疯狂夹杂着一丝喜悦，然后，他做了个欢欣鼓舞的姿势，接着猛地向上跳了一下，差点儿撞到天花板。","From the first outcry, my forebodings had warned me of the true object and centre of alarm.There was nothing now but uproar, above, beneath, and around us; footsteps stumbling pell-mell up the public staircase, eager shouts and heavy thumps at the door, the whiz and dash of water from the engines, and the crash of furniture thrown upon the pavement.At once, the truth flashed upon my friend.His frenzy took the hue of joy, and, with a wild gesture of exultation, he leaped almost to the ceiling of the chamber."
"“我的故事！”奥伯伦叫道，“烟囱！房顶！那魔鬼趁晚上逃了出来，吓得千万人床上跳起来，惊慌失措啦！而我站在这里——是个大获全胜的作家！万岁！万岁！我的头脑点燃了这座小镇！万岁！”","“My tales!” cried Oberon.“The chimney!The roof!The Fiend has gone forth by night, and startled thousands in fear and wonder from their beds!Here I stand,—a triumphant author!Huzza! Huzza!My brain has set the town on fire! Huzza!”"
