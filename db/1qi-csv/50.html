		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在写自传正文之前，似乎应该说明一下，为什么我认为有必要为自己平凡的一生留本书作为纪念。我从来没有想象过自己讲叙的任何一部分，会作为一个故事或者因为与我有关而引起公众的兴趣。但是我想，在这个时代，教育和教育改良在英国历史上比以往任何时候受到的关注都要多（如果说不是更深刻的话），为一种不同寻常、引人注意的教育经历留下一些记录也许是有益的；不管这种教育还产生了哪些影响，都证明了在早期能够教给小孩子的东西，比人们通常想象的多很多，而且可以教得很好；用通常所说的教诲方式教育孩子，他们的童年时代实际上是被浪费掉了。我还觉得，在观念转变的时代，如果有人勇于探索，对于自己及他人的思想既善于吸纳，也能有所扬弃，那么，把他思想的各个阶段记录下来，似乎不仅有益，而且也很有趣。但是对我而言，还有比这更重要的动机，就是希望向帮助过我智力和道德发展的人表示感谢。他们当中有的声名显赫；有的能力卓著，但还没有得到应有的声誉；还有我最需要感谢的一个人，也是外界根本没有机会了解的一个人。如果哪位读者对这些东西不感兴趣，却还要继续往下读的话，那就只能怪他自己了；我不奢望他沉迷于此书，只希望他能记得，这本自传并非为他而写。</td>
		<td class="en">It seems proper that I should prefix to the following biographical sketch, some mention of the reasons which have made me think it desirable that I should leave behind me such a memorial of so uneventful a life as mine. I do not for a moment imagine that any part of what I have to relate, can be interesting to the public as a narrative, or as being connected with myself. But I have thought that in an age in which education, and its improvement, are the subject of more, if not of profounder study than at any former period of English history, it may be useful that there should be some record of an education which was unusual and remarkable, and which, whatever else it may have done, has proved how much more than is commonly supposed may be taught, and well taught, in those early years which, in the common modes of what is called instruction, are little better than wasted. It has also seemed to me that in an age of transition in opinions, there may be somewhat both of interest and of benefit in noting the successive phases of any mind which was always pressing forward, equally ready to learn and to unlearn either from its own thoughts or from those of others. But a motive which weighs more with me than either of these, is a desire to make acknowledgment of the debts which my intellectual and moral development owes to other persons; some of them of recognized eminence, others less known than they deserve to be, and the one to whom most of all is due, one whom the world had no opportunity of knowing. The reader whom these things do not interest, has only himself to blame if he reads farther, and I do not desire any other indulgence from him than that of bearing in mind, that for him these pages were not written. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我于1806年5月20日出生于伦敦，是家里的长子，我的父亲是詹姆斯.穆勒，《英属印度史》的作者。祖父是安格斯郡诺斯沃特桥的一名小商人，同时（我认为）也是小农场主。还在儿童时代，父亲就因天资聪慧，引起了苏格兰财政部的一位贵族——费特凯恩的约翰.斯图尔特爵士的注意，因此得到简.斯图尔特夫人（约翰.斯图尔特爵士的妻子）和其他几位夫人成立的基金资助而被送往爱丁堡大学深造，该基金设立的目的是为苏格兰教会培养年轻人。在那里，父亲接受了常规教育，获得了传教士证书，但是从未从事这项职业，因为他深知自己不能相信那个教派或其他任何教派的教义。有几年，他在苏格兰的各种家庭里做过家庭教师，其中包括特威代尔侯爵家，但是最终定居伦敦，致力于写作。1819年，他受聘于东印度公司，在这之前，除了写作，他没有任何其他收入来源。</td>
		<td class="en">I was born in London, on the 20th of May, 1806, and was the eldest son of James Mill, the author of The History of British India. My father, the son of a petty tradesman and (I believe) small farmer, at Northwater Bridge, in the county of Angus, was, when a boy, recommended by his abilities to the notice of Sir John Stuart, of Fettercairn, one of the Barons of the Exchequer in Scotland, and was, in consequence, sent to the University of Edinburgh, at the expense of a fund established by Lady Jane Stuart (the wife of Sir John Stuart) and some other ladies for educating young men for the Scottish Church. He there went through the usual course of study, and was licensed as a Preacher, but never followed the profession; having satisfied himself that he could not believe the doctrines of that or any other Church. For a few years he was a private tutor in various families in Scotland, among others that of the Marquis of Tweeddale; but ended by taking up his residence in London, and devoting himself to authorship. Nor had he any other means of support until 1819, when he obtained an appointment in the India House. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >父亲在人生的这段时间里，有两件事不能不让人称奇。不过很遗憾，其中一件其实很平常，另一件又极不寻常。一件是，他当时没有什么收入来源，只靠向期刊投稿这种不稳定的方式，还能够娶妻生子，组建了大家庭；这种行为无论从理智，还是从责任上来讲，与他的观点，至少与他后半生努力坚持的观点完全相反。另一件是，他这种生活方式需要异常充沛的精力，从一开始写作他就面临很多不利条件，结婚也给他带来了不利因素。这么多年，他靠写作，即便只养活了自己和家庭，能从不欠债，又从没陷入经济困难，也是件很不容易的事情。何况他还坚持他的政治和宗教观点，让当时所有权贵和普通英国富人都产生空前绝后的厌恶之情；而且，父亲这个人，不仅任何因素都不能让他写出与自己信念相悖的东西，而且总是在环境允许的情况下，尽可能地把自己的信念融入所有作品当中。可以说，他是一个做任何事情都从不敷衍的人，不管是文学还是其他的工作，他都倾注全力，以求做到尽善尽美。尽管身肩重负，他还是策划、启动并完成了《英属印度史》的编纂。这花了他十年时间，比其他作者（甚至是专职作家）编纂同等规模且需要相当的阅读量和研究量的史书所花的时间都短。还需要指出的是，在整个过程中，他几乎每天都要花不少时间教导孩子。就拿我来说，他所付出的精力、关爱和坚持不懈非比寻常，他按照他自己的构想，努力给孩子最高层次的智力教育。</td>
		<td class="en">In this period of my father’s life there are two things which it is impossible not to be struck with: one of them unfortunately a very common circumstance, the other a most uncommon one. The first is, that in his position, with no resource but the precarious one of writing in periodicals, he married and had a large family; conduct than which nothing could be more opposed, both as a matter of good sense and of duty, to the opinions which, at least at a later period of life, he strenuously upheld. The other circumstance, is the extraordinary energy which was required to lead the life he led, with the disadvantages under which he labored from the first, and with those which he brought upon himself by his marriage. It would have been no small thing, had he done no more than to support himself and his family during so many years by writing, without ever being in debt, or in any pecuniary difficulty; holding, as he did, opinions, both in politics and in religion, which were more odious to all persons of influence, and to the common run of prosperous Englishmen in that generation than either before or since; and being not only a man whom nothing would have induced to write against his convictions, but one who invariably threw into everything he wrote, as much of his convictions as he thought the circumstances would in any way permit: being, it must also be said, one who never did anything negligently; never undertook any task, literary or other, on which he did not conscientiously bestow all the labour necessary for performing it adequately. But he, with these burdens on him, planned, commenced, and completed, the History of India; and this in the course of about ten years, a shorter time than has been occupied (even by writers who had no other employment) in the production of almost any other historical work of equal bulk, and of anything approaching to the same amount of reading and research. And to this is to be added, that during the whole period, a considerable part of almost every day was employed in the instruction of his children: in the case of one of whom, myself, he exerted an amount of labour, care, and perseverance rarely, if ever, employed for a similar purpose, in endeavouring to give, according to his own conception, the highest order of intellectual education. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个自己做事时恪守决不浪费时间这一原则的人，在教育学生时,很可能也会如此。我记不清自己开始学习希腊语的时间了，听人说是三岁。对这件事，我最早的记忆就是背诵父亲写在卡片上的普通希腊语单词表，后面附有英语意思。学语法是几年后的事情，我只学了名词和动词的曲折变化，但是学完单词之后，立刻就开始学习翻译了。我只能模糊地记得读过《伊索寓言》，这是我读的第一本希腊语书籍。第二本书是《远征记》，我对这本书的印象稍微深刻一点。直到八岁，我才开始学拉丁语。那时，在父亲的指导下，我阅读了很多希腊散文家的作品，其中，我记得自己读了希罗多德的全都作品，还有色诺芬的《居鲁士的教育》和《回忆苏格拉底》；读了第欧根尼.拉尔修写的一些哲学家生平；还读了卢奇安的一部分作品，以及伊索克拉底的《全希腊盛会献词》和《泛雅典娜节献词》的一部分。1813年，我还读了柏拉图对话录（按普通排列顺序）的前六卷，从《尤息弗罗》到《泰阿泰德》。我认为，《泰阿泰德》在此可以省略，因为我不可能看得懂。但是父亲在整个教学过程中，不仅要求我尽最大努力做力所能及之事，还极力要求我做力所不能及之事。我学希腊语的所有功课，都是在他写作时跟他在同一个房间的同一张桌子上完成的。从这件事或许可以看出来，他为了教导我是乐于承担责任的。那时，没有希腊语英语词典，而我还没开始学拉丁语，根本无法查阅希腊语拉丁语词典，所以每次碰到不认识的单词，就不得不向父亲讨教。父亲是个急脾气的人，但他甘愿忍受这种持续的干扰，而且还在这种干扰下写了好几卷《英属印度史》，还有那几年必须要写的所有其他文章。</td>
		<td class="en">A man who, in his own practice, so vigorously acted up to the principle of losing no time, was likely to adhere to the same rule in the instruction of his pupil. I have no remembrance of the time when I began to learn Greek. I have been told that it was when I was three years old. My earliest recollection on the subject, is that of committing to memory what my father termed vocables, being lists of common Greek words, with their signification in English, which he wrote out for me on cards. Of grammar, until some years later, I learnt no more than the inflexions of the nouns and verbs, but, after a course of vocables, proceeded at once to translation; and I faintly remember going through Aesop’s Fables, the first Greek book which I read. The Anabasis, which I remember better, was the second. I learnt no Latin until my eighth year. At that time I had read, under my father’s tuition, a number of Greek prose authors, among whom I remember the whole of Herodotus, and of Xenophon’s Cyropædia and Memorials of Socrates; some of the lives of the philosophers by Diogenes Laertius; part of Lucian, and Isocrates’ Ad Demonicum and Ad Nicoclem. I also read, in 1813, the first six dialogues (in the common arrangement) of Plato, from the Euthyphron to the Theætetus inclusive: which last dialogue, I venture to think, would have been better omitted, as it was totally impossible I should understand it. But my father, in all his teaching, demanded of me not only the utmost that I could do, but much that I could by no possibility have done. What he was himself willing to undergo for the sake of my instruction, may be judged from the fact, that I went through the whole process of preparing my Greek lessons in the same room and at the same table at which he was writing: and as in those days Greek and English Lexicons were not, and I could make no more use of a Greek and Latin Lexicon than could be made without having yet begun to learn Latin, I was forced to have recourse to him for the meaning of every word which I did not know. This incessant interruption, he, one of the most impatient of men, submitted to, and wrote under that interruption several volumes of his History and all else that he had to write during those years. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这段童年时光里，除了希腊语之外，唯一的一门课程就是算术，也是父亲教我的。算术是晚上的课程，我还清楚地记得学得多么不开心。但是上课只是我每天所受教育的一部分。另外大部分是我自己阅读，以及父亲对我的口头教导，后者大多是我们一起散步的时候进行的。1810年到1813年年底，我们住在纽因顿格林，当时，那里的环境基本和农村一样。父亲的身体状况需要坚持锻炼，所以他有早饭前散步的习惯，一般就在通往霍恩西的芊芊小路上。散步时，我总是陪着他，我对绿地和野花的最初记忆中夹杂着每天向父亲作头一天阅读内容的汇报。我记得汇报是我自愿做的功课，而非出于被迫。我一边读书，一边在纸片上记笔记，早上散步的时候，就按笔记上的内容给父亲讲故事，这是因为我读的大部分是历史书。以这种方式我读了很多书：罗伯逊的历史著作,休谟和吉本的作品。但是当时以及后来很长一段时间，我一直最喜欢读的是沃森的《腓力二世》和《腓力三世》。书中描述的马耳他骑士英勇抵抗土耳其人，荷兰反叛省份抵制西班牙，都激起了我强烈而持久的兴趣。仅次于沃森，我最喜欢的历史著作是胡克的《罗马史》。那时，我还没有读过系统的希腊历史，只读过学校课本上的节选，以及罗林编的《古代史》的翻译本中从马其顿国王腓力开始的最后两三卷。但是，兰霍恩翻译的普卢塔克的作品，我读得津津有味。在英国历史方面，休谟停笔以后的历史中，我记得读过柏内特的《当代史》，尽管我只喜欢里面的战争和战役部分。还读过《年度纪事》里从一开始到1788年的历史部分，这部分是父亲为我从边沁先生那里借来的书中所没有的。我对陷入困境的普鲁士的弗雷德里克，和科西嘉爱国者保利，产生了强烈的兴趣；但是关于美国独立战争，由于还是一个孩子，我站到了错误的立场上（直到被父亲纠正过来），因为那被叫做英国立场。我和父亲经常一起讨论我阅读的书籍，他一有机会就给我讲解一些概念，如文明、政府、道德和智力培养，然后让我用自己的话复述给他听。他还让我读了很多我自己不感兴趣的书，然后向他口头复述。值得一提的是，这些书中有米勒的《英国政府历史观》，此书在当时备受赞誉，父亲也对其倍加推崇。莫斯海姆的《基督教教会史》，麦克里的《约翰.诺克斯传》，甚至还有休厄尔和拉提的《贵格会教徒史》。他喜欢让我看那些主角在艰难的环境下展现出能力和智慧、顽强战胜困难的书籍。在这些书当中，我还记得比弗的《非洲大事记》和柯林斯对新南威尔士第一批移民的描述。有两本书我百读不厌，一本是安森的《航海记》，大多数年轻人都喜欢读，另一本是《环球航海集》（我认为是霍克斯沃思编写的），有四卷，从德雷克开始，到库克和布干维尔结束。我几乎没有玩具和儿童读物，只是偶尔有亲戚或熟人送给我这样的礼物，其中《鲁滨孙漂流记》是最好的，我整个童年时代都很喜欢。父亲并不是完全不让我读消遣的书籍，但也只是偶尔允许。这种书他当时几乎没有，但是给我借了好几本，我记得有《一千零一夜》、卡佐特的《阿拉伯故事集》、《唐吉诃德》和埃奇沃思女士的《通俗故事集》，以及当时有些名声的布鲁克的《上流社会的傻子》。</td>
		<td class="en">The only thing besides Greek, that I learnt as a lesson in this part of my childhood, was arithmetic: this also my father taught me: it was the task of the evenings, and I well remember its disagreeableness. But the lessons were only a part of the daily instruction I received. Much of it consisted in the books I read by myself, and my father’s discourses to me, chiefly during our walks. From 1810 to the end of 1813 we were living in Newington Green, then an almost rustic neighbourhood. My father’s health required considerable and constant exercise, and he walked habitually before breakfast, generally in the green lanes towards Hornsey. In these walks I always accompanied him, and with my earliest recollections of green fields and wild f lowers, is mingled that of the account I gave him daily of what I had read the day before. To the best of my remembrance, this was a voluntary rather than a prescribed exercise. I made notes on slips of paper while reading, and from these in the morning walks, I told the story to him; for the books were chiefly histories, of which I read in this manner a great number: Robertson’s histories, Hume1, Gibbon; but my greatest delight, then and for long afterwards, was Watson’s Philip the Second and Third. The heroic defence of the Knights of Malta against the Turks, and of the revolted provinces of the Netherlands against Spain, excited in me an intense and lasting interest. Next to Watson, my favorite historical reading was Hooke2’s History of Rome. Of Greece I had seen at that time no regular history, except school abridgments and the last two or three volumes of a translation of Rollin’s Ancient History, beginning with Philip of Macedon. But I read with great delight Langhorne’s translation of Plutarch. In English history, beyond the time at which Hume leaves off, I remember reading Burnet’s History of His Own Time, though I cared little for anything in it except the wars and battles; and the historical part of the Annual Register, from the beginning to about 1788, where the volumes my father borrowed for me from Mr. Bentham3 left off. I felt a lively interest in Frederic of Prussia4 during his difficulties, and in Paoli, the Corsican patriot; but when I came to the American War, I took my part, like a child as I was (until set right by my father) on the wrong side, because it was called the English side. In these frequent talks about the books I read, he used, as opportunity offered, to give me explanations and ideas respecting civilization, government, morality, mental cultivation, which he required me afterwards to restate to him in my own words. He also made me read, and give him a verbal account of, many books which would not have interested me sufficiently to induce me to read them of myself: among others, Millar’s Historical View of the English Government, a book of great merit for its time, and which he highly valued; Mosheim’s Ecclesiastical History, McCrie’s Life of John Knox5, and even Sewell’s and Rutty’s Histories of the Quakers6. He was fond of putting into my hands books which exhibited men of energy and resource in unusual circumstances, struggling against difficulties and overcoming them: of such works I remember Beaver’s African Memoranda, and Collins’s account of the first settlement of New South Wales. Two books which I never wearied of reading were Anson’s Voyage, so delightful to most young persons, and a Collection (Hawkesworth’s, I believe) of Voyages round the World, in four volumes, beginning with Drake7 and ending with Cook8 and Bougainville. Of children’s books, any more than of playthings, I had scarcely any, except an occasional gift from a relation or acquaintance: among those I had, Robinson Crusoe was preeminent, and continued to delight me through all my boyhood. It was no part, however, of my father’s system to exclude books of amusement, though he allowed them very sparingly. Of such books he possessed at that time next to none, but he borrowed several for me; those which I remember are the Arabian Nights, Cazotte’s Arabian Tales, Don Quixote, Miss Edgeworth’s Popular Tales, and a book of some reputation in its day, Brooke’s Fool of Quality.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >八岁时，我和我的一个妹妹一起开始学习拉丁语，我一边学，一边教她，然后她再向父亲汇报课程。从那时起，其他兄弟姐妹都陆续加入，成了我的学生，白天大部分时间，我都在做这种预备教学。其实我很不喜欢做这件事情，尤其是我要对学生们的功课负责，几乎跟对待我自己的功课完全一样。但是，从这种锻练中我受益匪浅，对于教的内容，我能够学得更全面，记得更牢固。教学的时候向别人解释难点，这种训练可能即使在那么小的年龄也是很有用的。就其他方面讲，我童年时代的经历并不利于小孩子们互相教学的安排。我敢肯定，当时的教学效率非常低，我也很清楚，老师和学生之间的关系，对彼此来说也不是很好的道德约束。我就是这样学完了拉丁语语法，还有科尼利厄斯.内波斯的作品和恺撒的《回忆录》的一大部分，但是后来，除了督导这些课程之外，我自己还学习了更多的课程。</td>
		<td class="en">In my eighth year I commenced learning Latin, in conjunction with a younger sister, to whom I taught it as I went on, and who afterwards repeated the lessons to my father: and from this time, other sisters and brothers being successively added as pupils, a considerable part of my day’s work consisted of this preparatory teaching. It was a part which I greatly disliked; the more so, as I was held responsible for the lessons of my pupils, in almost as full a sense as for my own: I, however, derived from this discipline the great advantage, of learning more thoroughly and retaining more lastingly the things which I was set to teach: perhaps, too, the practice it afforded in explaining difficulties to others, may even at that age have been useful. In other respects, the experience of my boyhood is not favorable to the plan of teaching children by means of one another. The teaching, I am sure, is very inefficient as teaching, and I well know that the relation between teacher and taught is not a good moral discipline to either. I went in this manner through the Latin grammar, and a considerable part of Cornelius Nepos and Caesar’s Commentaries, but afterwards added to the superintendence of these lessons, much longer ones of my own. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >开始学习拉丁语的同一年，我第一次开始读希腊诗人的作品，先读了《伊利亚特》。在这上面有了一些进展之后，父亲把蒲柏的译作交到我手中。这本译作是我愿意读的第一本英语诗著作，而且成为多年来我一直特别喜欢的书之一。我想，我肯定从头到尾读过二三十遍。它是非常优秀的叙事和韵律的典范，我想，要不是我发现并非所有男孩子都特别喜欢它的话，我就不会觉得值得一提了，尽管从理论和我个人的经验来看，少年时代喜欢它看似非常自然。在这之后不久，仍然在父亲的指导下，我开始学习几何，又过了一阵子，开始学代数。</td>
		<td class="en">In the same year in which I began Latin, I made my first commencement in the Greek poets with the Iliad.9 After I had made some progress in this, my father put Pope’s translation into my hands. It was the first English verse I had cared to read, and it became one of the books in which for many years I most delighted: I think I must have read it from twenty to thirty times through. I should not have thought it worth while to mention a taste apparently so natural to boyhood, if I had not, as I think, observed that the keen enjoyment of this brilliant specimen of narrative and versification is not so universal with boys, as I should have expected both a priori and from my individual experience. Soon after this time I commenced Euclid10, and somewhat later, algebra, still under my father’s tuition. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我记得，从八岁到十二岁，我读的拉丁语书籍有维吉尔的《牧歌》以及《埃涅伊特》的前六本，除了《抒情诗》之外贺拉斯的全部作品，费德鲁斯的寓言，李维《罗马史》的前五卷（由于喜欢这个主题，闲着的时候，我自愿读了前十卷的剩余部分），萨卢斯特的全部作品，奥维德《变形记》的大部分，泰伦斯的一些剧本，卢克莱修的两三本书，西塞罗的好几本演说集和关于演讲术的著作，以及他给阿提库斯的信件。父亲不辞劳苦，为我把蒙戈尔特注解中的历史说明从法语翻译过来。我通读了希腊语的《伊利亚特》和《奥德赛》，索福克勒斯、欧里庇得斯和阿里斯托芬的一两个剧本（但从中受益很少），修昔底德的全部作品，色诺芬的《希腊史》，狄摩西尼、埃斯基涅斯和利西阿斯作品的一大部分，忒奥克里托斯、阿那克里翁的全部作品，《文选》的一部分，狄奥尼修斯的一小部分作品，波利比奥斯的好几本书，最后是亚里士多德的《修辞学》。《修辞学》是我读过的关于道德或心理学主题的第一本科学的专著，书中包括很多古代人对人性和人生最到位的观察。父亲让我仔细研读，还让我把里面的内容列成一览表。这几年，我还全面学习了初级几何和代数，而微分学和高等数学的其他部分则学得远远不够全面。因为父亲把早年掌握的这些知识全都忘了，没有时间再捡起来帮我解答难题，所以，除了书本之外，几乎没有什么可以帮助我的。而我经常由于无法解决很难的习题，总是招惹父亲不快，但他没有看到，其实我根本不具备解决这些问题必需的知识储备。</td>
		<td class="en">From my eighth to my twelfth year the Latin books which I remember reading were, the Bucolics of Virgil, and the first six books of the Aeneid; all Horace11, except the Epodes; the fables of Phaedrus; the first five books of Livy12 (to which from my love of the subject I voluntarily added, in my hours of leisure, the remainder of the first decade); all Sallust; a considerable part of Ovid’s Metamorphoses; some plays of Terence13; two or three books of Lucretius; several of the Orations of Cicero14, and of his writings on oratory; also his letters to Atticus, my father taking the trouble to translate to me from the French the historical explanations in Mongault’s notes. In Greek I read the Iliad and Odyssey through; one or two plays of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, though by these I profited little; all Thucydides15; the Hellenics of Xenophon16; a great part of Demosthenes, Aeschines, and Lysias; Theocritus; Anacreon; part of the Anthology; a little of Dionysius; several books of Polybius; and lastly, Aristotle’s Rhetoric, which, as the first expressly scientific treatise on any moral or psychological subject which I had read, and containing many of the best observations of the ancients on human nature and life, my father made me study with peculiar care, and throw the matter of it into synoptic tables. During the same years I learnt elementary geometry and algebra thoroughly, the differential calculus, and other portions of the higher mathematics far from thoroughly: for my father, not having kept up this part of his early acquired knowledge, could not spare time to qualify himself for removing my difficulties, and left me to deal with them, with little other aid than that of books: while I was continually incurring his displeasure by my inability to solve difficult problems for which he did not see that I had not the necessary previous knowledge. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >关于自己读的书，我只能说一说还记得的。我最偏爱的仍然是历史，尤其是古代史。我不厌其烦地读米特福德的《希腊史》。父亲提醒我警惕作者保守派的偏见，以及他为了美化暴君、诋毁民主制度而颠倒的事实。他用希腊演说家和历史学家的例子向我讲述这些观点，结果在读米特福德时，我和作者赞同的东西总是相反的，在某种程度上，我甚至能提出反对他的观点；但是，每次读这本书时所带来的新的愉悦，并没有因此而减少。我以前的最爱胡克和弗格森讲述的罗马历史继续给我带来快乐。有本书，尽管有人称它风格单调乏味，但我非常喜欢读，那就是《古代通史》。我不厌其烦地读，满脑子都是最不知名的古代人的详细资料，但是现代史，除了一些孤立的章节，如荷兰独立战争外，相对来说，我知道得很少，也不怎么关注。整个少年时代，我心甘情愿做的而且很上瘾的事情就是我所谓的“写历史”。我相继创作了一部《罗马史》（是从胡克的《罗马史》中摘选出来的），《古代通史》的节略本，一部《荷兰史》（是从我最喜欢的沃森和一部匿名的汇编中选录出来的）。十一二岁的时候，我在专注地写一些自以为比较严肃的东西。这不亚于一部罗马政府的历史，编辑的资料源于李维和迪奥尼修斯（还得益于胡克），我写了很多，都可以出八卷本的书了，一直写到颁行李西尼法的时代。实际上，它记述的是贵族与平民之间的斗争，当时它吸引了我的全部兴趣和关注，而这种关注过去仅集中在罗马征战中。我讨论了出现过的每一个体制上的观点。尽管我完全不知道尼布尔的研究成果，但是在父亲的指导下，按照李维提供的证据，我证明了农业法的正确性，而且尽自己所能地支持了罗马民主党。几年后，由于蔑视自己孩子气的努力，我把这些文章都毁掉了，那时根本没想到，以后还会对自己初次尝试写作和推理有任何好奇。但是，父亲鼓励我进行这种有用的娱乐活动，尽管他从来不要求看我写的东西，我觉得这很明智。这样一来，我就不会觉得写作要对谁负责，也没有被一双挑剔的眼睛盯着而害怕的感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">As to my private reading, I can only speak of what I remember. History continued to be my strongest predilection, and most of all ancient history. Mitford’s Greece I read continually; my father had put me on my guard against the Tory prejudices of this writer, and his perversions of facts for the whitewashing of despots, and blackening of popular institutions. These points he discoursed on, exemplifying them from the Greek orators and historians, with such effect that in reading Mitford my sympathies were always on the contrary side to those of the author, and I could, to some extent, have argued the point against him: yet this did not diminish the ever new pleasure with which I read the book. Roman history, both in my old favorite, Hooke, and in Ferguson, continued to delight me. A book which, in spite of what is called the dryness of its style, I took great pleasure in, was the Ancient Universal History, through the incessant reading of which, I had my head full of historical details concerning the obscurest ancient people, while about modern history, except detached passages such as the Dutch War of Independence, I knew and cared comparatively little. A voluntary exercise, to which throughout my boyhood I was much addicted, was what I called writing histories. I successively composed a Roman History, picked out of Hooke; an abridgment of the Ancient Universal History; a History of Holland, from my favorite Watson and from an anonymous compilation; and in my eleventh and twelfth year I occupied myself with writing what I flattered myself was something serious. This was no less than a history of the Roman Government, compiled (with the assistance of Hooke) from Livy and Dionysius: of which I wrote as much as would have made an octavo volume, extending to the epoch of the Licinian Laws. It was, in fact, an account of the struggles between the patricians and plebeians, which now engrossed all the interest in my mind which I had previously felt in the mere wars and conquests of the Romans. I discussed all the constitutional points as they arose: though quite ignorant of Niebuhr’s researches, I, by such lights as my father had given me, vindicated the Agrarian Laws on the evidence of Livy, and upheld, to the best of my ability, the Roman Democratic party. A few years later, in my contempt of my childish efforts, I destroyed all these papers, not then anticipating that I could ever feel any curiosity about my first attempts at writing and reasoning. My father encouraged me in this useful amusement, though, as I think judiciously, he never asked to see what I wrote; so that I did not feel that in writing it I was accountable to any one, nor had the chilling sensation of being under a critical eye. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管写历史的练习从来都不是必修课，但是，有一样写作是必须的，即写诗，这是我最不喜欢的功课之一。我没有写过希腊语和拉丁语的诗，也没学这两种语言的格律。父亲认为花太多时间做这个不值得，所以只让我给他读出来，订正我不对的地方。我从未用希腊语写作过，甚至连散文都没写过，只用拉丁语写过一点点。不是父亲不在乎写作对于全面掌握这些语言的重要性，而是根本没有时间这么做。他要求我写的是英语诗歌。第一次读蒲柏翻译的《荷马史诗》的时候，我雄心勃勃地要写一部类似的著作，而且写了《伊利亚特》的续集那么长的一本书。我自发的写诗抱负，很可能那时就中止了；但是，最初我自愿写诗的做法，后来因父亲的命令坚持了下去。父亲总是尽量给我解释他要求我做某件事的原因，我记得很清楚，这件事他同样也给出两条原因，都非常符合他的风格。一条是，有些事用诗来表达比用散文更清楚，更有力，他说这是个实实在在的长处。另一条是，人们大都给予诗歌比它本身更高的价值，因此，有必要获得写诗的能力。他一般都让我自己选择主题，我记得大多是给一些神话人物或者寓言抽象物致词，但是他让我把贺拉斯的很多短诗翻译成英语。我还记得他让我读汤姆逊的《冬天》，然后让我自己试着（不看书）就同一主题写些东西。当然，我写的诗纯粹是些废话，我也从来没有学会任何写诗的技巧，但是这种练习让我后来更容易获得表达能力。到这时，我读的英语诗歌仍然很少。父亲把莎士比亚的作品放到我手中，主要是让我读历史剧，然而我却继续读其他的剧本。父亲一直都不怎么崇拜莎士比亚，他甚至曾严厉地批判这位英国人的偶像。除了弥尔顿（他最崇拜的人）、哥尔德斯密斯和彭斯的诗歌以及格雷的《游吟诗人》（比起《墓园挽歌》，父亲更喜欢格雷的这首作品），别的英国诗歌父亲都不喜欢，或许还喜欢柯珀和贝蒂。他对斯宾塞评价也不低，我记得他给我读（不像他一贯让我读给他听的做法）《仙后》的第一本，但是我不怎么喜欢。他觉得本世纪的诗歌几乎没什么价值，所以成年之前，我对当代诗歌几乎完全不熟悉，但是沃尔特.司各特的浪漫诗歌除外，那是在父亲的推荐下读的，我非常感兴趣，因为我一贯喜欢活泼的叙事。德莱顿的诗是我父亲喜欢读的，他让我读了很多，但是除了《亚历山大的盛宴》之外，我一首都不喜欢。我经常用自己的调子，在心里默唱这首诗和沃尔特.司各特的很多抒情诗，我甚至给司各特的一些抒情诗谱了曲子，到现在都还记得。柯珀的短诗我还比较喜欢读，但是从来没有去读长诗；而他的两卷书里的任何东西，都不如他用散文写的三只野兔让我感兴趣。十三岁时，我偶然读了坎贝尔的诗，其中《洛希尔》《霍恩林登》《埃琳的放逐》和其他一些诗给我的震撼，是以前读诗的时候从来没有体验过的。至此，我还是轻视长诗，《怀俄明的格特鲁德》除了令人震撼的开篇外，我长久以来一直觉得那是痛苦的极量。</td>
		<td class="en">But though these exercises in history were never a compulsory lesson, there was another kind of composition which was so, namely, writing verses, and it was one of the most disagreeable of my tasks. Greek and Latin verses I did not write, nor learnt the prosody of those languages. My father, thinking this not worth the time it required, contented himself with making me read aloud to him, and correcting false quantities. I never composed at all in Greek, even in prose, and but little in Latin. Not that my father could be indifferent to the value of this practice, in giving a thorough knowledge of these languages, but because there really was not time for it. The verses I was required to write were English. When I first read Pope’s Homer, I ambitiously attempted to compose something of the same kind, and achieved as much as one book of a continuation of the Iliad. There, probably, the spontaneous promptings of my poetical ambition would have stopped; but the exercise, begun from choice, was continued by command. Conformably to my father’s usual practice of explaining to me, as far as possible, the reasons for what he required me to do, he gave me, for this, as I well remember, two reasons highly characteristic of him: One was, that some things could be expressed better and more forcibly in verse than in prose: this, he said, was a real advantage. The other was, that people in general attached more value to verse than it deserved, and the power of writing it, was, on this account, worth acquiring. He generally left me to choose my own subjects, which, as far as I remember, were mostly addresses to some mythological personage or allegorical abstraction; but he made me translate into English verse many of Horace’s shorter poems: I also remember his giving me Thomson’s “Winter” to read, and afterwards making me attempt (without book) to write something myself on the same subject. The verses I wrote were, of course the merest rubbish, nor did I ever attain any facility of versification, but the practice may have been useful in making it easier for me, at a later period, to acquire readiness of expression. I had read, up to this time, very little English poetry. Shakespeare my father had put into my hands, chiefly for the sake of the historical plays, from which, however, I went on to the others. My father never was a great admirer of Shakespeare, the English idolatry of whom he used to attack with some severity. He cared little for any English poetry except Milton (for whom he had the highest admiration), Goldsmith, Burns17, and Gray’s “Bard,” which he preferred to his Elegy: perhaps I may add Cowper18 and Beattie19. He had some value for Spenser20, and I remember his reading to me (unlike his usual practice of making me read to him), the first book of The Fairie Queene; but I took little pleasure in it. The poetry of the present century he saw scarcely any merit in, and I hardly became acquainted with any of it till I was grown up to manhood, except the metrical romances of Walter Scott, which I read at his recommendation and was intensely delighted with; as I always was with animated narrative. Dryden’s Poems were among my father’s books, and many of these he made me read, but I never cared for any of them except Alexander’s Feast, which, as well as many of the songs in Walter Scott, I used to sing internally, to a music of my own: to some of the latter, indeed, I went so far as to compose airs, which I still remember. Cowper’s short poems I read with some pleasure, but never got far into the longer ones; and nothing in the two volumes interested me like the prose account of his three hares. In my thirteenth year I met with Campbell’s Poems, among which “Lochiel,” “Hohenlinden,” “The Exile of Erin,” and some others, gave me sensations I had never before experienced from poetry. Here, too, I made nothing of the longer poems, except the striking opening of “Gertrude of Wyoming,” which long kept its place in my feelings as the perfection of pathos. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大概从十二岁起，我接受的教育进入了另一个更高的阶段。主要的学习对象已经不再是思维辅助和应用方面，而是思维本身。从学习逻辑开始，在逻辑学里，我一上来就开始学《工具论》，一直读完包括分析学在内的所有内容，但我从后验分析里面收益甚少。后验分析属于推断的一个分支，我那时还不够成熟，无法理解。在读《工具论》的同时，父亲让我读了好几篇关于经院逻辑的拉丁语论文，有的全部都读，有的读一部分。每天我们一起散步的时候，他让我详细汇报读过的东西，并回答他许多敏锐的问题。这之后，我以相似的方式，通读了霍布斯的《计算法和逻辑学》，这本书比经院派逻辑学家的著作在思想层次上高了一大截，父亲对它推崇备至。在我看来，它确实很有价值，但父亲未免有些夸张。不管要求我学什么，父亲一贯的做法，是让我尽可能地理解并感觉到它们的效用。他觉得，这种做法在学习三段论法逻辑的时候尤其适用，而三段论法的作用受到了很多权威作家的责难。我清楚地记得，那次在巴格肖特赫斯附近散步的时候（我们那时去拜访父亲的老朋友华莱士先生，他当时是皇家陆军军官大学的数学教授），父亲是怎样尝试用问题激发我对这个题目的思考，让我对三段论法逻辑学的效用构成形成一些概念，我无法理解时，他就解释给我听。当时，这些解释并没有让我弄清楚这个问题，但是也并非没用，它们成为我的观察和沉思赖以成形的核心。后来我通过自己所注意到的一些具体情况理解了父亲所做的概括性的论述。我自己的认识和体验，最终让我像他一样高度评价少时真正通晓经院派逻辑学的价值。我认为，在我接受的教育当中，我所获得的任何思考能力，最应该归功于它。我比较熟练的早期智力练习，是仔细剖析错误的论点，并找出谬误在什么地方。不管在这种练习中我获得了什么样的能力，都应归功于父亲，是他坚持训练我，让我做这样的智力练习。但是，不可否认经院派逻辑学以及学习它时养成的思维习惯，是这种训练的主要手段之一。我相信，在现代教育中，经院派逻辑如果运用适当的话，没有任何东西能像它一样塑造缜密的思想家，这些思想家会赋予文字和命题精确的意义，而且不受模糊、不精确或不明确术语的影响。被引以自豪的数学研究，其影响力根本不能与它相比，因为在数学步骤中，正确的推理过程不25我的知识之路会产生真正的难题。数学研究也特别适合哲学学生早期阶段的教育，因为它不以学生通过经验和思考形成自己有价值思想的缓慢过程为条件。他们有可能在自己的思维能力到达一个高级阶段之前，就能解开混乱、自相矛盾的思想中的难题。这种本领是很多本来可以很有能力的人，因缺乏这种训练而欠缺的。当他们必须反击对手时，只能试图用自己所能驾驭的论据来论证反面结论，而很少尝试去驳斥对手的推理。因此，只要解决问题取决于论证的话，最多只能双方不分胜负，悬而不决。</td>
		<td class="en">From about the age of twelve, I entered into another and more advanced stage in my course of instruction; in which the main object was no longer the aids and appliances of thought, but the thoughts themselves. This commenced with Logic, in which I began at once with the Organon21, and read it to the Analytics inclusive, but profited little by the Posterior Analytics, which belong to a branch of speculation I was not yet ripe for. Contemporaneously with the Organon, my father made me read the whole or parts of several of the Latin treatises on the scholastic logic; giving each day to him, in our walks, a minute account of what I had read, and answering his numerous and searching questions. After this, I went in a similar manner, through the “Computatio sive Logica” of Hobbes, a work of a much higher order of thought than the books of the school logicians, and which he estimated very highly; in my own opinion beyond its merits, great as these are. It was his invariable practice, whatever studies he exacted from me, to make me as far as possible understand and feel the utility of them: and this he deemed peculiarly fitting in the case of the syllogistic logic, the usefulness of which had been impugned by so many writers of authority. I well remember how, and in what particular walk, in the neighbourhood of Bagshot Heath (where we were on a visit to his old friend Mr. Wallace, then one of the Mathematical Professors at Sandhurst) he first attempted by questions to make me think on the subject, and frame some conception of what constituted the utility of the syllogistic logic, and when I had failed in this, to make me understand it by explanations. The explanations did not make the matter at all clear to me at the time; but they were not therefore useless; they remained as a nucleus for my observations and reflections to crystallize upon; the import of his general remarks being interpreted to me, by the particular instances which came under my notice afterwards. My own consciousness and experience ultimately led me to appreciate quite as highly as he did, the value of an early practical familiarity with the school logic. I know of nothing, in my education, to which I think myself more indebted for whatever capacity of thinking I have attained. The first intellectual operation in which I arrived at any proficiency, was dissecting a bad argument, and finding in what part the fallacy lay: and though whatever capacity of this sort I attained, was due to the fact that it was an intellectual exercise in which I was most perseveringly drilled by my father, yet it is also true that the school logic, and the mental habits acquired in studying it, were among the principal instruments of this drilling. I am persuaded that nothing, in modern education, tends so much, when properly used, to form exact thinkers, who attach a precise meaning to words and propositions, and are not imposed on by vague, loose, or ambiguous terms. The boasted influence of mathematical studies is nothing to it; for in mathematical processes, none of the real difficulties of correct ratiocination occur. It is also a study peculiarly adapted to an early stage in the education of philosophical students, since it does not presuppose the slow process of acquiring, by experience and reflection, valuable thoughts of their own. They may become capable of disentangling the intricacies of confused and self-contradictory thought, before their own thinking faculties are much advanced; a power which, for want of some such discipline, many otherwise able men altogether lack; and when they have to answer opponents, only endeavour, by such arguments as they can command, to support the opposite conclusion, scarcely even attempting to confute the reasonings of their antagonists; and, therefore, at the utmost, leaving the question, as far as it depends on argument, a balanced one. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这段时间，我继续和父亲一起读拉丁语和希腊语书籍，大都是不仅语言值得学习，思想也值得学习的书。这其中包括很多演说家尤其是狄摩西尼的著作，他的一些主要演说我从头到尾看了好几遍，并且以练习的方式，写了全面的分析。我把演说读给父亲听的时候，他的评价对我很有启发。他不仅使我注意到这些演讲中为雅典制度提供的真知灼见，以及它们经常举例说明的立法和政府的原则，还指出演说家的技巧和艺术——如何把对他有利的一切东西，在他把观众的思维带到最适合接受它们的状态时说出；如何逐渐通过暗示，悄悄地把思想植入观众的脑袋，而这些思想，如果以一种更直接方式表达的话，就会引起观众的反对。就这些想法中的大部分而言，我当时还没有能力完全理解；但是它们种下了种子，而且在适当的季节生根发芽。这时，我还读了塔西佗、尤维纳利斯和昆体良的全部著作。后者由于风格晦涩，而且很多论述由学究气的细节组成，因此很少有人读，难以得到足够的赏识。他的书相当于一部古人整个教育和文化思想的百科全书；我一生中持有的很多有价值的观点，都清楚地源自他的书，即使是那么年幼的时候读的。就在这时，我第一次读了柏拉图一些最重要的对话录，尤其是《高尔吉亚篇》《普罗泰哥拉篇》和《共和政体》。父亲认为柏拉图对自己精神文化的影响比任何作家都要大，他经常向年轻学生推荐的也是他。这一点在我身上也体现出来。以柏拉图式的对话为范例的苏格拉底问答法，是一种非常卓越的训练方法，用以纠正错误，在智力允许的情况下澄清悟性混乱。这种智力允许的情况是指在通俗的语法及措词的指导下，能够产生大量联想意义的理解。这种精确、透彻的问答法，让模糊笼统的人要么用明确的术语向自己解释意思，要么干脆承认不知道自己在说什么。永远用具体的例子检验所有一般性的陈述，对抽象、涵义广的术语进行形式上的限定，这需要确定某个更大的类别，这一类别包括许多术语，通过对相关事物进行一系列精确的区分，标出它的界限和定义，使这些术语细化到想要的程度——所有这一切，作为精确思考的训练，都是极宝贵的。所有这一切，即使在我那么小的年龄，也能抓住我的注意力，成为我思维的一部分。从那时起，我一直觉得，柏拉图主义者的头衔更应该属于那些从柏拉图研究模式中受益并努力践行它的人，而不是那些仅因为采用某些武断的结论而出名的人，这些结论大多是从柏拉图最难理解的著作中提取的，而从他的思想和作品特征来看，恐怕连他自己都不确定这些是诗歌式的幻想，还是哲学猜想。</td>
		<td class="en">During this time, the Latin and Greek books which I continued to read with my father were chiefly such as were worth studying not for the language merely, but also for the thoughts. This included much of the orators, and especially Demosthenes22, some of whose principal orations I read several times over, and wrote out, by way of exercise, a full analysis of them. My father’s comments on these orations when I read them to him were very instructive to me. He not only drew my attention to the insight they afforded into Athenian institutions, and the principles of legislation and government which they often illustrated, but pointed out the skill and art of the orator—how everything important to his purpose was said at the exact moment when he had brought the minds of his audience into the state most fitted to receive it; how he made steal into their minds, gradually and by insinuation, thoughts which, if expressed in a more direct manner would have roused their opposition. Most of these reflections were beyond my capacity of full comprehension at the time; but they left seed behind, which germinated in due season. At this time I also read the whole of Tacitus23, Juvenal24, and Quintilian25. The latter, owing to his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up, is little read, and seldom sufficiently appreciated. His book is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him, even at that early age. It was at this period that I read, for the first time, some of the most important dialogues of Plato, in particular the Gorgias26, the Protagoras27, and the Republic. There is no author to whom my father thought himself more indebted for his own mental culture, than Plato, or whom he more frequently recommended to young students. I can bear similar testimony in regard to myself. The Socratic method28, of which the Platonic dialogues are the chief example, is unsurpassed as a discipline for correcting the errors, and clearing up the confusions incident to the intellectus sibi permissus, the understanding which has made up all its bundles of associations under the guidance of popular phraseology. The close, searching elenchus by which the man of vague generalities is constrained either to express his meaning to himself in definite terms, or to confess that he does not know what he is talking about; the perpetual testing of all general statements by particular instances; the siege in form which is laid to the meaning of large abstract terms, by fixing upon some still larger class-name which includes that and more, and dividing down to the thing sought—marking out its limits and definition by a series of accurately drawn distinctions between it and each of the cognate objects which are successively parted off from it—all this, as an education for precise thinking, is inestimable, and all this, even at that age, took such hold of me that it became part of my own mind. I have felt ever since that the title of Platonist belongs by far better right to those who have been nourished in, and have endeavoured to practise Plato’s mode of investigation, than to those who are distinguished only by the adoption of certain dogmatical conclusions, drawn mostly from the least intelligible of his works, and which the character of his mind and writings makes it uncertain whether he himself regarded as anything more than poetic fancies, or philosophic conjectures. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在读柏拉图和狄摩西尼时我已经没有语言上的困难了，所以在通读这些作者的作品时，父亲不让我逐句地解释，而是大声读出来，并回答他的问题。但是，由于他特别注意朗诵法（在这方面他非常优秀），所以给他朗读是件很痛苦的事。在他要求我做的所有事情当中，只有这件事是我总也做不好，或者总让他对我发火的。对于朗读艺术的原则，他思考过很多，尤其是最常被人忽视的那部分，如音调变化，朗诵法的作者称它为韵律（一方面和发音形成对比，另一方面和措词形成对比），并基于对句子的逻辑分析，将其归纳成准则。他让我牢牢记住这些准则，我每次违反，都会受到严厉的指责。但是，我甚至在那时就注意到（尽管我没有斗胆跟他谈及此事），虽然我句子读得不好的时候他责备我，并告诉我应该怎么读，但是他从来没有通过自己朗读，来给我展示应该怎样朗读。他的教育方式以及他的整个思考方式一直有一个缺点，就是过于相信抽象事物在没有具体事例佐证时仍能够被理解，除了这一点，他的教育方式还是很值得钦佩的。在我青年末期，我自己或者在和同龄伙伴练习朗读与演讲时，我才第一次理解他的准则针对的对象和它们的心理学根据。那时，我和其他人一直探究这个主题，追本溯源，原本是能够在父亲的原则的基础之上创作一篇非常有用的论文的。但他自己没有把这些原则和准则写下来。我也很遗憾，由于系统地实践，当时我满脑子都是这个主题，但我没有把它们以及我们对它们的改进，以正式的形式写下来。</td>
		<td class="en">In going through Plato and Demosthenes, since I could now read these authors, as far as the language was concerned, with perfect ease, I was not required to construe them sentence by sentence, but to read them aloud to my father, answering questions when asked: but the particular attention which he paid to elocution (in which his own excellence was remarkable) made this reading aloud to him a most painful task. Of all things which he required me to do, there was none which I did so constantly ill, or in which he so perpetually lost his temper with me. He had thought much on the principles of the art of reading, especially the most neglected part of it, the inflexions of the voice, or modulation as writers on elocution call it (in contrast with articulation on the one side, and expression on the other), and had reduced it to rules, grounded on the logical analysis of a sentence. These rules he strongly impressed upon me, and took me severely to task for every violation of them: but I even then remarked (though I did not venture to make the remark to him) that though he reproached me when I read a sentence ill, and told me how I ought to have read it, he never, by reading it himself, showed me how it ought to be read. A defect running through his otherwise admirable modes of instruction, as it did through all his modes of thought, was that of trusting too much to the intelligibleness of the abstract, when not embodied in the concrete. It was at a much later period of my youth, when practising elocution by myself, or with companions of my own age, that I for the first time understood the object of his rules, and saw the psychological grounds of them. At that time I and others followed out the subject into its ramifications and could have composed a very useful treatise, grounded on my father’s principles. He himself left those principles and rules unwritten. I regret that when my mind was full of the subject, from systematic practice, I did not put them, and our improvements of them, into a formal shape. </td></tr>

The number of new ideas which I received from this remarkable book, and the impulse and stimulus as well as guidance given to my thoughts by its criticisms and disquisitions on society and civilization in the Hindoo part, on institutions and the acts of governments in the English part, made my early familiarity with it eminently useful to my subsequent progress.

His loved and intimate friend, Ricardo28, had shortly before published the book which formed so great an epoch in political economy; a book which never would have been published or written, but for the entreaty and strong encouragement of my father; for Ricardo, the most modest of men, though firmly convinced of the truth of his doctrines, deemed himself so little capable of doing them justice in exposition and expression, that he shrank from the idea of publicity. The same friendly encouragement induced Ricardo, a year or two later, to become a member of the House of Commons; where, during the few remaining years of his life, unhappily cut short in the full vigour of his intellect, he rendered so much service to his and my father’s opinions both in political economy and on other subjects. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管李嘉图的伟大作品已经出版，但是具有教诲性的，并以适合初学者方式写的有关其学说的论文，还没有出现。因此，父亲开始用授课的方式教我学习这门科学，在我们散步的时候讲给我听。他每天阐述这个主题的一部分，第二天，我交给他书面报告，他会让我一遍又一遍地重写，直到写得清晰易懂，严谨周密，并且相对比较完整。我以这种方式学完了这门学科的所有内容。我为了每天向他汇报而写的书面大纲，后来成了他写《政治经济学要义》的笔记。这之后，我读了李嘉图，每天报告读的内容，并尽我最大努力，讨论学习的过程中出现的问题。论金钱，是这个主题中最复杂的部分，他让我以同样的方式读李嘉图写于金价论战时期令人钦佩的小册子。这之后，我又读了亚当.斯密的大作，父亲让我读的主要目的之一，是让我把李嘉图的卓越观点应用于斯密较肤浅的政治经济学观点，找出斯密论据的谬误之处，或者结论中的任何错误。这种指导方式的目的在于培养思想家，是种非常好的指导方式。但是，必须由一个像父亲一样亲近、精力充沛的思想家来进行。这条路即使对父亲来说也是痛苦的，当然，对我来说更是如此，虽然我对这个主题很感兴趣。父亲经常由于我的失败而发火，而且不可理喻，因为在这些情况下我根本不可能成功；但总体来说，他的方法是正确的，也成功了。我认为，没有任何科学的教学方法，比父亲教我逻辑学和政治经济学的方法更全面，或更适合培养能力。他通过让我自己找出所有答案，努力调动活跃我的才能，甚至到了夸张的程度。他之前不给我解释，直到我感觉束手无策时才点拨一二；他不仅根据我当时的理解，给我这两大科目的准确知识，还让我成为逻辑学和政治经济学的思想家。我几乎从一开始就独立思考，偶尔和他的想法不一样，尽管在很长时间内，都是在小问题上不一样，最后还是以他的观点为最终标准。后来，我甚至偶尔把他给说服了，在某些小细节上，改变了他的观点。我把这归功于他，而不是我自己。这个例子直接说明了他的完全公正，以及他的教学法的真正价值。</td>
		<td class="en">Though Ricardo’s great work was already in print, no didactic treatise embodying its doctrines, in a manner fit for learners, had yet appeared. My father, therefore, commenced instructing me in the science by a sort of lectures, which he delivered to me in our walks. He expounded each day a portion of the subject, and I gave him next day a written account of it, which he made me rewrite over and over again until it was clear, precise, and tolerably complete. In this manner I went through the whole extent of the science; and the written outline of it which resulted from my daily compte rendu, served him afterwards as notes from which to write his Elements of Political Economy. After this I read Ricardo, giving an account daily of what I read, and discussing, in the best manner I could, the collateral points which offered themselves in our progress. On Money, as the most intricate part of the subject, he made me read in the same manner Ricardo’s admirable pamphlets, written during what was called the Bullion controversy; to these succeeded Adam Smith; and in this reading it was one of my father’s main objects to make me apply to Smith’s more superficial view of political economy, the superior lights of Ricardo, and detect what was fallacious in Smith’s arguments, or erroneous in any of his conclusions. Such a mode of instruction was excellently calculated to form a thinker; but it required to be worked by a thinker, as close and vigorous as my father. The path was a thorny one, even to him, and I am sure it was so to me, notwithstanding the strong interest I took in the subject. He was often, and much beyond reason, provoked by my failures in cases where success could not have been expected; but in the main his method was right, and it succeeded. I do not believe that any scientific teaching ever was more thorough, or better fitted for training the faculties, than the mode in which logic and political economy were taught to me by my father. Striving, even in an exaggerated degree, to call forth the activity of my faculties, by making me find out everything for myself, he gave his explanations not before, but after, I had felt the full force of the difficulties; and not only gave me an accurate knowledge of these two great subjects, as far as they were then understood, but made me a thinker on both. I thought for myself almost from the first, and occasionally thought differently from him, though for a long time only on minor points, and making his opinion the ultimate standard. At a later period I even occasionally convinced him, and altered his opinion on some points of detail: which I state to his honour, not my own. It at once exemplifies his perfect candour, and the real worth of his method of teaching. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，我严格意义上的功课学习结束了。大概十四岁的时候，我离开英国一年多。回来之后，尽管我的学习仍然在父亲的总体指导下进行，他已经不再是我的老师了。因此，我在这儿打住，回到前面的回忆中提到的，与我的生活和教育有关的一些泛泛的事情上去。</td>
		<td class="en">At this point concluded what can properly be called my lessons: when I was about fourteen I left England for more than a year; and after my return, though my studies went on under my father’s general direction, he was no longer my schoolmaster. I shall therefore pause here, and turn back to matters of a more general nature connected with the part of my life and education included in the preceding reminiscences. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我部分回忆到的教育过程中，最明显的一点就是在童年时代，父亲努力给予我属于高等教育的知识，这种知识在成年之前很少能获得（如果真能获得的话）。这个实验的结果证明了这件事要办到其实很简单，也深刻揭露了学生们要花那么多年宝贵时间，学习一点点拉丁语和希腊语，纯属浪费时间。这种浪费让很多教育改革家有了把这些语言从普通教育中完全取消的轻率提议。如果我生来就理解速度极快，或者记忆力精确持久，又或者性格极其积极、充满活力的话，那么这个试验可能不具备决定意义。但是我在这些天分上，低于标准，而非高于标准。我能做到的，任何能力一般、体格健康的男孩或女孩肯定都做得到。如果说我取得了一些成绩的话，在诸多有利因素中，最应该归功于父亲给予我的早期训练，毫不夸张地说，与同龄人相比，我的优势在于我起步比他们早了四分之一个世纪。</td>
		<td class="en">In the course of instruction which I have partially retraced, the point most superficially apparent is the great effort to give, during the years of childhood an amount of knowledge in what are considered the higher branches of education, which is seldom acquired (if acquired at all) until the age of manhood. The result of the experiment shows the ease with which this may be done, and places in a strong light the wretched waste of so many precious years as are spent in acquiring the modicum of Latin and Greek commonly taught to schoolboys; a waste which has led so many educational reformers to entertain the ill-judged proposal of discarding those languages altogether from general education. If I had been by nature extremely quick of apprehension, or had possessed a very accurate and retentive memory, or were of a remarkably active and energetic character, the trial would not be conclusive; but in all these natural gifts I am rather below than above par; what I could do, could assuredly be done by any boy or girl of average capacity and healthy physical constitution: and if I have accomplished anything, I owe it, among other fortunate circumstances, to the fact that through the early training bestowed on me by my father, I started, I may fairly say, with an advantage of a quarter of a century over my contemporaries. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我已经提到过这种训练里面最重要的一点，训练中获得的任何益处都源自于它。大多数通过反复练习而获得知识的孩子或年轻人，他们的智能不但没有得到提高，反而被知识湮没了。他们的脑子里填满了单纯的事实，以及他人的观点和言辞，他们接受了这些东西，让它们取代了形成自己观点的能力。因此，一位杰出父亲的儿子，不遗余力地接受教育，经常长大后却只会鹦鹉学舌，除了回忆学过的东西外，他的大脑别无他用。然而，我的教育不是填鸭式的。父亲决不允许我所学的东西仅仅退化为记忆的练习。他不仅力求教学过程的每一步我都能理解，有可能的话，还让我的理解提前于教学。任何需要思考才能获得的东西，他从来都不会告诉我，除非我已经尽了最大努力还没有找出来。如果我没记错的话，在这方面我表现得很差。回想起来，这种事情我基本都是失败，很少成功。其实，失败经常发生在以我的初学程度几乎不可能成功的地方。我记得十三岁时，有一次我碰巧用到“观点”这个词，他问我什么是观点，我没能很好地下定义，他表示出不满。我还记得，我说了一句套话，说有些东西理论上正确，但是实践起来需要改进，他听了很气愤。在我试图定义“理论”徒劳无功后，他向我解释了它的意思，并指出我所用的通俗语言的谬误。这让我完全相信，不能给“理论”正确地下定义，还说它可能与实践不一致，我是多么的无知。他这么做，似乎很不讲理，或者说就是很不讲理。但是我想，这只是在我失败而惹他生气时才会发生。如果从来不要求学生做他做不到的事情，那么他也决不会去做所有自己能做到的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">There was one cardinal point in this training, of which I have already given some indication, and which, more than anything else, was the cause of whatever good it effected. Most boys or youths who have had much knowledge drilled into them, have their mental capacities not strengthened, but overlaid by it. They are crammed with mere facts, and with the opinions or phrases of other people, and these are accepted as a substitute for the power to form opinions of their own: and thus the sons of eminent fathers, who have spared no pains in their education, so often grow up mere parroters of what they have learnt, incapable of using their minds except in the furrows traced for them. Mine, however, was not an education of cram. My father never permitted anything which I learnt to degenerate into a mere exercise of memory. He strove to make the understanding not only go along with every step of the teaching, but, if possible, precede it. Anything which could be found out by thinking I never was told, until I had exhausted my efforts to find it out for myself. As far as I can trust my remembrance, I acquitted myself very lamely in this department; my recollection of such matters is almost wholly of failures, hardly ever of success. It is true the failures were often in things in which success in so early a stage of my progress, was almost impossible. I remember at some time in my thirteenth year, on my happening to use the word idea, he asked me what an idea was; and expressed some displeasure at my ineffectual efforts to define the word: I recollect also his indignation at my using the common expression that something was true in theory but required correction in practice; and how, after making me vainly strive to define the word theory, he explained its meaning, and showed the fallacy of the vulgar form of speech which I had used; leaving me fully persuaded that in being unable to give a correct definition of Theory, and in speaking of it as something which might be at variance with practice, I had shown unparalleled ignorance. In this he seems, and perhaps was, very unreasonable; but I think, only in being angry at my failure. A pupil from whom nothing is ever demanded which he cannot do never does all he can. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年少时即小有成绩的人，大都会有一个毛病，而这经常是致命的，会毁掉人的前途，父亲时刻不忘，谨防它的出现。这个毛病就是自满。他非常警惕，不让我听到赞美之词，或者被人引导，拿自己和别人做自得的比较。从他和我的交流当中，我只会觉得自己非常低微。他给我订立的比较标准，不是看别人做过什么，而是一个人能够做什么，以及应该做什么。他非常成功地使我免于受到那些他所担心的事情的影响。我根本没意识到我的成绩在那个年龄来说，有什么不寻常。如果我偶尔注意到别的男孩比我懂得少的话——这种情况比想象的要少——我的结论不是我懂得多，而是他，由于某种原因懂得少，或者他的知识类型与我的不同。我的心态不是谦逊，但也不是自大。我心里从来没有过“我怎么样”，或“我能怎么样”之类的想法。我没有高估，也没有低估自己：我根本就不估量自己。如果说我对自己有过什么想法的话，就是我在学习上太落后，因为和父亲对我的期望相比，我总是如此。我这么说非常肯定，可是在我童年时见过我的许多人，对我的印象并非如此。我后来发现，他们觉得我非常自大，令人不快；很可能是因为我爱争论，不管听到别人说什么，都直接反驳，从不迟疑。我想，我养成这个坏习惯，是因为经常被鼓励谈论超越我年龄的事情，并且是和成年人讨论，但我从未告诫自己对他们要有基本的尊重。父亲之所以没有纠正我这种没教养、无礼的行为，很可能是因为没有注意到，因为我总是特别害怕他，在他面前只会极其克制，安静。然而不管怎么说，我没有任何优越感，这对我来说也是有益的。十四岁时，在即将离开父亲的家很长一段时间的前夕，我记得就在海德公园的那个地方，父亲告诉我说，在开始认识新的人的时候，我应该知道自己学了很多东西，是和我一样大的年轻人通常不知道的。很多人会和我说起这件事，还会因此恭维我。关于这个话题，他还说了什么，我记得不很清楚了。但是，他总结说，不管我比别人多知道些什么，都不能归功于我自己，而要归功于我的运气好，有非常难得的优势，那就是有个能教导我，并且乐意花费必要的心思和时间的父亲。如果我比没有类似优势的人懂得多的话，并不值得赞美，比他们懂得少，才是最大的耻辱。我很清楚地记得，这是父亲第一次暗示我，说我比其他受过良好教育的年轻人懂得多，与他告诉我的其他事情一样，我对此毫不怀疑，但我并没有把它视为个人问题。我不会因为别人不知道我所知道的事情，就要赞美自己。我也从没有自夸，说自己的成就，不管是什么，有一点点归功于我自己。但是，现在我已经注意到这个问题了，我觉得父亲关于我的独特优势的说法，完全是事实，在这件事上也符合常理，它使我的看法和感觉从那时起始终如一。</td>
		<td class="en">One of the evils most liable to attend on any sort of early proficiency, and which often fatally blights its promise, my father most anxiously guarded against. This was self-conceit. He kept me, with extreme vigilance, out of the way of hearing myself praised, or of being led to make self-flattering comparisons between myself and others. From his own intercourse with me I could derive none but a very humble opinion of myself; and the standard of comparison he always held up to me, was not what other people did, but what a man could and ought to do. He completely succeeded in preserving me from the sort of influences he so much dreaded. I was not at all aware that my attainments were anything unusual at my age. If I accidentally had my attention drawn to the fact that some other boy knew less than myself—which happened less often than might be imagined—I concluded, not that I knew much, but that he, for some reason or other, knew little, or that his knowledge was of a different kind from mine. My state of mind was not humility, but neither was it arrogance. I never thought of saying to myself, I am, or I can do, so and so. I neither estimated myself highly nor lowly: I did not estimate myself at all. If I thought anything about myself, it was that I was rather backward in my studies, since I always found myself so, in comparison with what my father expected from me. I assert this with confidence, though it was not the impression of various persons who saw me in my childhood. They, as I have since found, thought me greatly and disagreeably self-conceited; probably because I was disputatious, and did not scruple to give direct contradictions to things which I heard said. I suppose I acquired this bad habit from having been encouraged in an unusual degree to talk on matters beyond my age, and with grown persons, while I never had inculcated on me the usual respect for them. My father did not correct this ill-breeding and impertinence, probably from not being aware of it, for I was always too much in awe of him to be otherwise than extremely subdued and quiet in his presence. Yet with all this I had no notion of any superiority in myself; and well was it for me that I had not. I remember the very place in Hyde Park where, in my fourteenth year, on the eve of leaving my father’s house for a long absence, he told me that I should find, as I got acquainted with new people, that I had been taught many things which youths of my age did not commonly know; and that many persons would be disposed to talk to me of this, and to compliment me upon it. What other things he said on this topic I remember very imperfectly; but he wound up by saying, that whatever I knew more than others, could not be ascribed to any merit in me, but to the very unusual advantage which had fallen to my lot, of having a father who was able to teach me, and willing to give the necessary trouble and time; that it was no matter of praise to me, if I knew more than those who had not had a similar advantage, but the deepest disgrace to me if I did not. I have a distinct remembrance, that the suggestion thus for the first time made to me, that I knew more than other youths who were considered well educated, was to me a piece of information, to which, as to all other things which my father told me, I gave implicit credence, but which did not at all impress me as a personal matter. I felt no disposition to glorify myself upon the circumstance that there were other persons who did not know what I knew; nor had I ever flattered myself that my acquirements, whatever they might be, were any merit of mine: but, now when my attention was called to the subject, I felt that what my father had said respecting my peculiar advantages was exactly the truth and common sense of the matter, and it fixed my opinion and feeling from that time forward. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在父亲教育计划的众多目标中，如果不是他小心翼翼地阻止我和其他男孩子过多接触的话，这个目标很显然不会实现。父亲不仅小心地让我避开常见的、男孩子间互相施加的坏影响，还急切地决心要让我避开粗俗的思考方式和感情的恶劣影响。为此，他情愿让我付出代价，即所有国家的男学生都具备的主要能力上，我却比别人差。我所受的教育的缺点，主要是不具备男孩子们在接受自谋生路的训练过程中学到的技能和他们在群体活动中所学到的东西。我虽然不怎么强壮，但是通过戒酒和散步，得以健康成长。然而，我不会做任何技能或是体能的事情，也完全不了解常见的身体锻炼方法。我并不是拒绝玩耍，或者没有时间玩耍。尽管父亲不给我假期，以免打破学习的习惯，养成懒惰的习性，但我每天还是有充足的时间自娱自乐。不过，因为我没有男孩玩伴，并且身体活动的动物本能已由散步来满足，所以我的娱乐活动大多都是单独进行的，即使不是手不释卷的话，通常也是安静的，除了能够刺激我为了学习已经开动的大脑外，这种活动不会给我的任何其他活动，甚至是智力活动带来刺激。因此，很长时间以来，我都不擅长做任何需要灵活动作的事情，后来好了一点，但是可以说一直以来都不怎么擅长。我的大脑以及双手，用来做具体的事情时，或者应该用到它们时，经常很没有效率，而对于大多数人来说，这些事情是生活中的主要情趣，也是他们所拥有的心智能力得以展现的主要方式。我经常由于对日常生活中的事物疏忽，不留心观察，经常因漫不经心而被训斥。在这些细节上，父亲和我完全相反：他的感官和头脑总是十分警觉，他做出的与他性格相符的决定和他所具有的活力体现在他的行事风格和生活中的每个举动中。这差不多和他的才干一样，总是给那些和他交往过的人留下深刻印象。但是，充满活力的父母的孩子，往往长大后很懒散，因为他们依赖父母，而父母也为他们积极打算。父亲给我的教育，本质上更适合于训练我思考的能力而非动手的能力。他并非不知道我的缺点，在我童年和青少年时期，他严厉地警告我这些问题，让我很痛苦。他绝不是不在乎或者能容忍这样的缺点，但是，尽管他使我免受学校生活的不利影响，他并没有尽力为我提供足够的东西来替代学校的实践作用。很可能对那些他自己没有费力气，或没经过特殊训练就获得的素质，不管是什么样的，他似乎都认为我也应该同样轻易就能获得。我想，在这点上，他没有像教育的其他方面那样给予同等的思考和关注。他似乎只期待成果，而不考虑起因。</td>
		<td class="en">It is evident that this, among many other of the purposes of my father’s scheme of education, could not have been accomplished if he had not carefully kept me from having any great amount of intercourse with other boys. He was earnestly bent upon my escaping not only the ordinary corrupting influence which boys exercise over boys, but the contagion of vulgar modes of thought and feeling; and for this he was willing that I should pay the price of inferiority in the accomplishments which schoolboys in all countries chiefly cultivate. The deficiencies in my education were principally in the things which boys learn from being turned out to shift for themselves, and from being brought together in large numbers. From temperance and much walking, I grew up healthy and hardy, though not muscular; but I could do no feats of skill or physical strength, and knew none of the ordinary bodily exercises. It was not that play, or time for it, was refused me. Though no holidays were allowed, lest the habit of work should be broken, and a taste for idleness acquired, I had ample leisure in every day to amuse myself; but as I had no boy companions, and the animal need of physical activity was satisfied by walking, my amusements, which were mostly solitary, were in general, of a quiet, if not a bookish turn, and gave little stimulus to any other kind even of mental activity than that which was already called forth by my studies; I consequently remained long, and in a less degree have always remained, inexpert in anything requiring manual dexterity; my mind, as well as my hands, did its work very lamely when it was applied, or ought to have been applied, to the practical details which, as they are the chief interest of life to the majority of men, are also the things in which whatever mental capacity they have, chiefly shows itself. I was constantly meriting reproof by inattention, inobservance, and general slackness of mind in matters of daily life. My father was the extreme opposite in these particulars: his senses and mental faculties were always on the alert; he carried decision and energy of character in his whole manner and into every action of life: and this, as much as his talents, contributed to the strong impression which he always made upon those with whom he came into personal contact. But the children of energetic parents, frequently grow up unenergetic, because they lean on their parents, and the parents are energetic for them. The education which my father gave me, was in itself much more fitted for training me to know than to do. Not that he was unaware of my deficiencies; both as a boy and as a youth I was incessantly smarting under his severe admonitions on the subject. There was anything but insensibility or tolerance on his part towards such shortcomings: but, while he saved me from the demoralizing effects of school life, he made no effort to provide me with any sufficient substitute for its practicalizing influences. Whatever qualities he himself, probably, had acquired without difficulty or special training, he seems to have supposed that I ought to acquire as easily. He had not, I think, bestowed the same amount of thought and attention on this, as on most other branches of education; and here, as well in some other points of my tuition, he seems to have expected effects without causes. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我从一开始接受的是没有任何宗教信仰的教育——按照大家对宗教信仰的普遍理解来说。我父亲受教于苏格兰长老会的教义，但他很早就通过自己的研究和反思，不仅抛弃了对《启示录》的信仰，还反对通常所谓的自然宗教的基本原则。我听他说过，他对这个问题的思想转折点，是读了巴特勒的《宗教类推》。谈起这部著作的时候，他总是充满敬意，说此书曾让他在相当长的一段时间内相信基督教的神圣权威。这部书向他证明，不管要相信《旧约》和《新约》是源自一个极其英明善良的人，或者是他行为的记录有多少困难，更具挑战意义的还在于要相信有这种性格的人是宇宙的造物主。他认为巴特勒的论证确凿，足以驳倒这本书针对的唯一对手。那些承认上帝万能、公正、善良，承认上帝是这个世界的创造者和统治者的人们，不能说反对基督教的话。如果说了，那么这些话可以带着至少同样的说服力，用来反驳他们自己。因此，他找不出自然神论中的缺陷，这让他一直很困惑。毫无疑问，经过多次挣扎后，他让步了，深信关于万物的起源这个问题，一切都不可知。这是对他的观点唯一正确的表述，因为他认为武断的无神论很荒诞，就像那些被称作无神论者的人，大部分人做的事情也很荒诞。这些细节很重要，因为它们表明了父亲反对所有这些所谓的宗教信仰，并不像很多人可能认为的那样，主要是因为逻辑和证据的问题，他反对的根据是道德上的，要高于智力层面。他觉得无法相信一个充满罪恶的世界，是兼有无穷力量、完美善良和正义的造物主的作品。人们试图蒙蔽自己以接受这种明显的矛盾，但他的智慧让他唾弃这种微妙的努力。然而他不会同样谴责塞伯伊人或摩尼教的理论，这些理论认为善恶互相争夺对宇宙的支配。我听他说过，他很吃惊为什么在我们这个时代，没有人重振善恶原则。他会认为善恶原则只是个假设，但他不会把它归为让人堕落的力量。事实上，他对宗教（按照这个词的通常含义）的反感，和卢克莱修一样：他对宗教的厌恶不是因为它不过是一种精神欺骗，而是因为宗教是一种强大的道德罪恶。他认为宗教是道德的最大敌人：首先，通过构建虚伪的美德——宗教的教义、虔诚的情感和宗教仪式，这些都与人类的美德没有关系——让它们取代真正的美德，为人接受；但最重要的，是通过从根本上损害道德的标准，让这个标准服从于一个人的意志，这个人得到了所有慷慨的奉承话。但是，冷静看待事实的话，这个人又被刻画得极其可恨。我听他说过一百次，说所有时代、所有国家都把他们的上帝描绘得很邪恶，而且总是越来越邪恶。人类不停地给邪恶添加一个又一个的特征，直到符合他们的大脑对邪恶最完美的设想，并把这称为上帝，拜倒在它面前。他认为，这种登峰造极的邪恶，体现在通常呈现于人类面前的基督教教义里。（他经常说）设想一下一个会创造地狱的人——由于他拥有着绝对的先知，因此在创造人类时他就带着这种目的，即绝大多数要经受可怕、恒久的折磨。我相信，这种可怕的膜拜对象的观念，很快将不再和基督教划上等号。有任何道德善恶意识的人，也会像我父亲一样，带着同样的义愤看待它。父亲也和所有人一样清楚，不论是从人们原先预想的方式还是程度上来说，基督徒总体上并没有受到这种教义似乎固有的腐化道德的影响。思想懒散，理智屈从于恐惧、愿望和情感的支配，让他们接受了这样一个自相矛盾的理论，也让他们无从理解这个理论的逻辑结论。这就是人类的能力，能够同时相信自相矛盾的事物，很少有人从他们当作真理接受的东西中得出推论，而只是汲取自己的感觉喜欢的东西。因此，大众坚信存在万能的地狱创造者，然而又把那个人看成是他们能够设想出来的完美仁慈的化身。他们想象的那个人其实是个魔鬼，他们崇拜的并不是这个魔鬼，而是他们自己对于美德的理想。不幸的是，这样的信仰，使得这种理想很可怜，很卑下，它顽固地抵制所有希望提升这种理想的想法。任何会让他们的头脑对美德产生明确概念以及更高标准的一连串的观点，信徒们都不愿意相信，因为他们觉得（即使在他们没有看清楚的时候）这样一个标准会和造物主的很多安排相冲突，和他们习惯接受的基督教的很多教义相冲突。因此，道德一直都是一种盲目的传统，没有一贯的原则，也没有一贯的感情去引导它。</td>
		<td class="en">I was brought up from the first without any religious belief, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. My father, educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had by his own studies and reflexions been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation, but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion. I have heard him say, that the turning point of his mind on the subject was reading Butler1’s Analogy2. That work, of which he always continued to speak with respect, kept him, as he said, for some considerable time, a believer in the divine authority of Christianity; by proving to him, that whatever are the difficulties in believing that the Old and New Testaments proceed from, or record the acts of, a perfectly wise and good being, the same and still greater difficulties stand in the way of the belief, that a being of such a character can have been the Maker of the universe. He considered Butler’s argument as conclusive against the only opponents for whom it was intended. Those who admit an omnipotent as well as perfectly just and benevolent maker and ruler of such a world as this, can say little against Christianity but what can, with at least equal force, be retorted against themselves. Finding, therefore, no halting place in Deism, he remained in a state of perplexity, until, doubtless after many struggles, he yielded to the conviction, that, concerning the origin of things nothing whatever can be known. This is the only correct statement of his opinion; for dogmatic atheism he looked upon as absurd; as most of those, whom the world has considered Atheists, have always done. These particulars are important, because they show that my father’s rejection of all that is called religious belief, was not, as many might suppose, primarily a matter of logic and evidence: the grounds of it were moral, still more than intellectual. He found it impossible to believe that a world so full of evil was the work of an Author combining infinite power with perfect goodness and righteousness. His intellect spurned the subtleties by which men attempt to blind themselves to this open contradiction. The Sabӕan, or Manichӕan theory of a Good and an Evil Principle, struggling against each other for the government of the universe, he would not have equally condemned; and I have heard him express surprise, that no one revived it in our time. He would have regarded it as a mere hypothesis; but he would have ascribed to it no depraving influence. As it was, his aversion to religion, in the sense usually attached to the term, was of the same kind with that of Lucretius3: he regarded it with the feelings due not to a mere mental delusion, but to a great moral evil. He looked upon it as the greatest enemy of morality: first, by setting up factitious excellences,— belief in creeds, devotional feelings, and ceremonies, not connected with the good of humankind,—and causing these to be accepted as substitutes for genuine virtues: but above all, by radically vitiating the standard of morals; making it consist in doing the will of a being, on whom it lavishes indeed all the phrases of adulation, but whom in sober truth it depicts as eminently hateful. I have a hundred times heard him say, that all ages and nations have represented their gods as wicked, in a constantly increasing progression, that mankind have gone on adding trait after trait till they reached the most perfect conception of wickedness which the human mind could devise, and have called this God, and prostrated themselves before it. This neplus ultra of wickedness he considered to be embodied in what is commonly presented to mankind as the creed of Christianity. Think (he used to say) of a being who would make a Hell—who would create the human race with the infallible foreknowledge, and therefore with the intention, that the great majority of them were to be consigned to horrible and everlasting torment. The time, I believe, is drawing near when this dreadful conception of an object of worship will be no longer identified with Christianity; and when all persons, with any sense of moral good and evil, will look upon it with the same indignation with which my father regarded it. My father was as well aware as any one that Christians do not, in general, undergo the demoralizing consequences which seem inherent in such a creed, in the manner or to the extent which might have been expected from it. The same slovenliness of thought, and subjection of the reason to fears, wishes, and affections, which enable them to accept a theory involving a contradiction in terms, prevents them from perceiving the logical consequences of the theory. Such is the facility with which mankind believe at one and the same time things inconsistent with one another, and so few are those who draw from what they receive as truths, any consequences but those recommended to them by their feelings, that multitudes have held the undoubting belief in an Omnipotent Author of Hell, and have nevertheless identified that being with the best conception they were able to form of perfect goodness. Their worship was not paid to the demon which such a Being as they imagined would really be, but to their own ideal of excellence. The evil is, that such a belief keeps the ideal wretchedly low; and opposes the most obstinate resistance to all thought which has a tendency to raise it higher. Believers shrink from every train of ideas which would lead the mind to a clear conception and an elevated standard of excellence, because they feel (even when they do not distinctly see) that such a standard would conflict with many of the dispensations of nature, and with much of what they are accustomed to consider as the Christian creed. And thus morality continues a matter of blind tradition, with no consistent principle, nor even any consistent feeling, to guide it. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I am thus one of the very few examples, in this country, of one who has, not thrown off religious belief, but never had it: I grew up in a negative state with regard to it. I looked upon the modern exactly as I did upon the ancient religion, as something which in no way concerned me. It did not seem to me more strange that English people should believe what I did not, than that the men whom I read of in Herodotus4 should have done so. History had made the variety of opinions among mankind a fact familiar to me, and this was but a prolongation of that fact. This point in my early education had, however, incidentally one bad consequence deserving notice. In giving me an opinion contrary to that of the world, my father thought it necessary to give it as one which could not prudently be avowed to the world. This lesson of keeping my thoughts to myself, at that early age, was attended with some moral disadvantages; though my limited intercourse with strangers, especially such as were likely to speak to me on religion, prevented me from being placed in the alternative of avowal or hypocrisy. I remember two occasions in my boyhood, on which I felt myself in this alternative, and in both cases I avowed my disbelief and defended it. My opponents were boys, considerably older than myself: one of them I certainly staggered at the time, but the subject was never renewed between us: the other who was surprised and somewhat shocked, did his best to convince me for some time, without effect. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >讨论自由现在有了很大进步，这是和我童年时最重要的区别之一，它大大改变了讨论这个问题所涉及的道德性。我认为，现在很少有具备和我父亲一样的智力和公德心，以强烈的道德信念坚持不受欢迎的宗教观点或其他伟大思想的人，不会把他们的这些想法公诸于世，或者反复劝导他人不要这样做。除非有这样的情况，而且这种情况越来越少，那就是坦白对这些问题的看法，要么会有失去谋生手段的危险，要么会被特别适合个人能力发挥的有益的领域排除在外。尤其在宗教问题上，我认为所有知识上过硬，经过深思熟虑后认为目前的观点不仅错误，而且有害的人，都有义务表达自己的异议，而这样的时刻已经到来了。至少那些有地位或有名誉，能让自己的观点有机会被人注意到的人，都有义务这么做。这样的声明会立刻结束，并永远结束那种庸俗的偏见，即认为无信仰（非常不恰当的叫法）与头脑或者心灵中的什么坏品质有关。如果世人知道最为世界增光添彩的人当中——即那些哪怕用通俗标准评价他们的智慧和美德，也是最卓越的人当中——有多大比例是彻底的宗教怀疑论者的话，会非常的震惊，他们中很多人克制自己不作声明，绝不是基于个人的考虑，而是本着在我目前看来十分错误的一种负责任的忧思，唯恐说出来会削弱现有的信仰，进而（像他们所认为的）削弱现有的约束，这样一来反而有害无益。</td>
		<td class="en">The great advance in liberty of discussion, which is one of the most important differences between the present time and that of my childhood, has greatly altered the moralities of this question; and I think that few men of my father’s intellect and public spirit, holding with such intensity of moral conviction as he did, unpopular opinions on religion, or on any other of the great subjects of thought, would now either practise or inculcate the withholding of them from the world, unless in the cases, becoming fewer every day, in which frankness on these subjects would either risk the loss of means of subsistence, or would amount to exclusion from some sphere of usefulness peculiarly suitable to the capacities of the individual. On religion in particular the time appears to me to have come, when it is the duty of all who being qualified in point of knowledge, have on mature consideration satisfied themselves that the current opinions are not only false but hurtful, to make their dissent known; at least, if they are among those whose station or reputation, gives their opinion a chance of being attended to. Such an avowal would put an end, at once and for ever, to the vulgar prejudice, that what is called, very improperly, unbelief, is connected with any bad qualities either of mind or heart. The world would be astonished if it knew how great a proportion of its brightest ornaments—of those most distinguished even in popular estimation for wisdom and virtue—are complete sceptics in religion; many of them refraining from avowal, less from personal considerations, than from a conscientious, though now in my opinion a most mistaken apprehension, lest by speaking out what would tend to weaken existing beliefs, and by consequence (as they suppose) existing restraints, they should do harm instead of good. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">Of unbelievers (so called) as well as of believers, there are many species, including almost every variety of moral type. But the best among them, as no one who has had opportunities of really knowing them will hesitate to affirm (believers rarely have that opportunity), are more genuinely religious, in the best sense of the word religion, than those who exclusively arrogate to themselves the title. The liberality of the age, or in other words the weakening of the obstinate prejudice which makes men unable to see what is before their eyes because it is contrary to their expectations, has caused it to be very commonly admitted that a Deist may be truly religious: but if religion stands for any graces of character and not for mere dogma, the assertion may equally be made of many whose belief is far short of Deism. Though they may think the proof incomplete that the universe is a work of design, and though they assuredly disbelieve that it can have an Author and Governor who is absolute in power as well as perfect in goodness, they have that which constitutes the principal worth of all religions whatever, an ideal conception of a Perfect Being, to which they habitually refer as the guide of their conscience; and this ideal of Good is usually far nearer to perfection than the objective Deity of those, who think themselves obliged to find absolute goodness in the author of a world so crowded with suffering and so deformed by injustice as ours. </td></tr>

My father’s moral inculcations were at all times mainly those of the “Socratici viri”; justice, temperance (to which he gave a very extended application), veracity, perseverance, readiness to encounter pain and especially labour; regard for the public good; estimation of persons according to their merits, and of things according to their intrinsic usefulness; a life of exertion, in contradiction to one of self-indulgent ease and sloth.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的人生观兼有斯多葛学派、伊壁鸠鲁学派和犬儒学派（取这个词的古代意义，不是现代意义）的特点。他的个人品质主要体现了斯多葛学派的特点。他的道德标准是伊壁鸠鲁学派的，因为它是实用主义的，以行动产生苦乐的倾向作为检验对错的唯一标准。但是，他很少相信快乐（这是犬儒学派的成分），单单在这点上，我可以很有信心地说，至少在他的晚年如此。他并非对快乐毫无感觉，但是他认为，与必须付出的代价相比，很少有快乐是值得争取的，至少在社会的目前状态下是这样。他认为，生活中更多的失败，可以归因于对快乐的过高估计。相应的，希腊哲学家们广义上所指的节制，即不逾越任何嗜好的适度范围，在父亲和这些哲学家们看来，几乎是教育规则的核心要点。他关于这种美德的谆谆教诲，占据了我童年记忆的很大一部分。他认为，在青春的鲜活和永不知足的好奇心消失之后，人类的生命充其量也就是个可怜的东西。这个话题他很少提起，尤其是年轻人在场的时候。但是，当他果真提起的时候，会带着一副深信不疑的神态。他有时会说，如果人生像设想的那样，能得到很好的管理和教育，那么人生还值得拥有。但是，即便是在谈这种可能时，他也从没带上半点热情。他一直都视智力享受高于其他任何享受，从未改变，即使以它们带来的快乐作为衡量价值的标准，而不顾其隐含的益处。他把仁爱的感情产生快乐的等级定得很高。他经常说，除了那些能够重温年轻时快乐的人，他从来不认识其他快乐的老人。对于所有激昂的情绪，和所有为了赞美它们所说、所写的东西，他都极度藐视，认为它们是愚蠢的行为。对他来说，“强烈”只是轻蔑之非难的代名词。他认为，与古人的道德标准相比，给感情施加重压偏离了现代的道德标准。照这样，他认为感情也不是赞扬和责备的合适对象。他认为对与错，善与恶，纯属行为的特性——行为包括进行了的行动和疏忽了的行动。没有任何感情不会导致，或者不会经常导致或好或坏的举动：最渴望做对的良心本身，却经常让人犯错。赞扬和责备的目的应该是阻止错误行为，鼓励正确行为，他始终如一地贯彻这个信条，不让行为人的动机影响到他的赞扬和责备。如果他认为一种行为是坏的，即使是出于一种责任感，他同样会严厉地指责，好像行为人有意做坏事一样。他不会因为宗教法官确实相信烧死异教徒是他们良心上的责任，就接受以此作为减轻他们罪状的申诉。尽管他不会因为意图坦率而减轻对行为的指责，但这在很大程度上影响到他对品质的评价。谁也不像他那样看重意图的认真和正直，也不像他那样，绝不能够看重任何他无法确信是否具有这样品质的人。但是，他同样不喜欢具备其他缺点的人，只要他认为这些缺点可能同样会让他们做坏事。比如，他讨厌任何邪恶运动中的狂热分子，觉得他们和那些因一己私利而发动这一运动的人一样可恶，甚至更可恶，因为他觉得前者破坏力更大。因此，他对很多智力上的错误，或者他认为是这种错误的厌恶，在某种意义上，带有道德感情的特征。所有这些不过是说，他的见解当中带有感情成分，他这样做的程度曾经很一般，但是现在很不寻常。确实，那些同时拥有丰富感情和见解的人竟然做不到这一点，是很令人费解的。只有那些不在乎见解的人才会将其与偏狭混为一谈。那些坚持认为自己的观点非常重要，相反的观点非常有害，且深切关心大众福利的人，必然会讨厌把他们认为对的当作错的，把他们认为错的当成对的人，而这些被厌恶的人在理论上成为了一类人。但是他们，我父亲也是，不需要因此忽视对手的良好品质，对个体的评价也不会局限于一个笼统的假定，而要看其品格的全部。我承认，一个真诚、不比别人少犯错误的人，很容易由于不值得讨厌的见解而讨厌别人。但是，如果他本人并没有诋毁这些人，又不纵容别人这样做，那么他就算宽容的。审慎地意识到平等自由地发表各种见解对人类的意义，源自于这种意识的容忍。这才是唯一值得称赞的，才是人类思想最高道德标准所能达到的宽容。</td>
		<td class="en">In his views of life he partook of the character of the Stoic5, the Epicurean6, and the Cynic7, not in the modern but the ancient sense of the word. In his personal qualities the Stoic predominated. His standard of morals was Epicurean, inasmuch as it was utilitarian, taking as the exclusive test of right and wrong, the tendency of actions to produce pleasure or pain. But he had (and this was the Cynic element) scarcely any belief in pleasure; at least in his later years, of which alone, on this point, I can speak confidently. He was not insensible to pleasures; but he deemed very few of them worth the price which, at least in the present state of society, must be paid for them. The greater number of miscarriages in life, he considered to be attributable to the overvaluing of pleasures. Accordingly, temperance, in the large sense intended by the Greek philosophers—stopping short at the point of moderation in all indulgences—was with him, as with them, almost the central point of educational precept. His inculcations of this virtue fill a large place in my childish remembrances. He thought human life a poor thing at best, after the freshness of youth and of unsatisfied curiosity had gone by. This was a topic on which he did not often speak, especially, it may be supposed, in the presence of young persons: but when he did, it was with an air of settled and profound conviction. He would sometimes say, that if life were made what it might be, by good government and good education, it would be worth having: but he never spoke with anything like enthusiasm even of that possibility. He never varied in rating intellectual enjoyments above all others, even in value as pleasure, independently of their ulterior benefits. The pleasures of the benevolent affections he placed high in the scale; and used to say, that he had never known a happy old man, except those who were able to live over again in the pleasures of the young. For passionate emotions of all sorts, and for everything which has been said or written in exaltation of them, he professed the greatest contempt. He regarded them as a form of madness. “The intense” was with him a byeword of scornful disapprobation. He regarded as an aberration of the moral standard of modern times, compared with that of the ancients, the great stress laid upon feeling. Feelings, as such, he considered to be no proper subjects of praise or blame. Right and wrong, good and bad, he regarded as qualities solely of conduct—of acts and omissions; there being no feeling which may not lead, and does not frequently lead, either to good or to bad actions: conscience itself, the very desire to act right, often leading people to act wrong. Consistently carrying out the doctrine, that the object of praise and blame should be the discouragement of wrong conduct and the encouragement of right, he refused to let his praise or blame be influenced by the motive of the agent. He blamed as severely what he thought a bad action, when the motive was a feeling of duty, as if the agents had been consciously evil doers. He would not have accepted as a plea in mitigation for inquisitors, that they sincerely believed burning heretics to be an obligation of conscience. But though he did not allow honesty of purpose to soften his disapprobation of actions, it had its full effect on his estimation of characters. No one prized conscientiousness and rectitude of intention more highly, or was more incapable of valuing any person in whom he did not feel assurance of it. But he disliked people quite as much for any other deficiency, provided he thought it equally likely to make them act ill. He disliked, for instance, a fanatic in any bad cause, as much or more than one who adopted the same cause from self-interest, because he thought him even more likely to be practically mischievous. And thus, his aversion to many intellectual errors, or what he regarded as such, partook, in a certain sense, of the character of a moral feeling. All this is merely saying that he, in a degree once common, but now very unusual, threw his feelings into his opinions; which truly it is difficult to understand how any one, who possesses much of both, can fail to do. None but those who do not care about opinions, will confound it with intolerance. Those who, having opinions which they hold to be immensely important, and the contraries to be prodigiously hurtful, have any deep regard for the general good, will necessarily dislike, as a class and in the abstract, those who think wrong what they think right, and right what they think wrong: though they need not therefore be, nor was my father, insensible to good qualities in an opponent, nor governed in their estimation of individuals by one general presumption, instead of by the whole of their character. I grant that an earnest person, being no more infallible than other men, is liable to dislike people on account of opinions which do not merit dislike; but if he neither himself does them any ill office, nor connives at its being done by others, he is not intolerant: and the forbearance, which flows from a conscientious sense of the importance to mankind of the equal freedom of all opinions, is the only tolerance which is commendable, or, to the highest moral order of minds, possible. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >应该承认，拥有上述观点和品质的人，很可能会给所有主要由他塑造的头脑留下深刻的道德印象，他的道德教学，不大可能会犯粗心或放纵的错误。他与孩子的道德关系中，缺乏的主要因素是亲切。我不认为他的天性中有这种缺陷。我相信，他的感情要比平常展示出来的丰富得多，而他情感的能力也比成长过程中所形成的大很多。他和大多数英国男人一样，为表露出感情而感到羞愧，但不表露的话，感情也就枯萎了。如果我们考虑得更深入一些，作为唯一的教师，他处在这样一个需要耐性的位置上，加上他的脾气本来就很急躁，虽然他曾为自己的孩子们做过，并努力地去做了那么多事，而他原本也会非常珍视他们对自己的爱，然而他一定经常感觉到，对他的害怕使得这种感情从源头上就枯竭了，这让我们无法不觉得这样的一位父亲真的很可怜。后来，与他更年幼的孩子们在一起时，就不是这样了。他们很体贴，很爱他。即使我不能说自己多么爱他的话，但也可以说总是对他很忠心，很孝顺。至于我自己的教育，我不敢断言，他的严格到底使我成为了失败者还是成功者。它并未阻止我拥有快乐的童年。但我也不相信只凭劝说和温言软语，就能促使男孩子们充满活力，并坚持不懈地（后者更为困难）投入到单调乏味、令人厌烦的学习中去。孩子们有很多事必须要做，很多东西必须要学，为此，严格的训练和让他们知道有可能受到惩罚，是不可或缺的手段。无疑，在现代教育中，尽量把要求年轻人学习的东西变得简单有趣是一个非常值得称赞的做法。但是，如果这个原则发展到只要求他们学习已变得简单有趣的东西的话，教育的一个主要目标就被埋没掉了。对于严酷、专制的旧教学体系的衰落，我感到很高兴，但它在培养勤奋学习这方面却很成功。而在我看来，新体系正在训练这样一批人，他们没有能力做任何不合意的事情。因此，我认为，敬畏作为教育中的一个因素，是不能省却的；但是我敢肯定，敬畏不应该是最主要的因素；如果它占支配地位，以至于阻断了孩子对他多年来应该无条件信任的老师的爱和信心，或者封住了孩子本性中率直、自发交流的源泉，那就是不幸了，而从教育的任何其他部分中产生的道德和智力上的受益，必然会因此而大打折扣。</td>
		<td class="en">It will be admitted, that a man of the opinions, and the character, above described, was likely to leave a strong moral impression on any mind principally formed by him, and that his moral teaching was not likely to err on the side of laxity or indulgence. The element which was chiefly deficient in his moral relation to his children, was that of tenderness. I do not believe that this deficiency lay in his own nature. I believe him to have had much more feeling than he habitually showed, and much greater capacities of feeling than were ever developed. He resembled most Englishmen in being ashamed of the signs of feeling, and, by the absence of demonstration, starving the feelings themselves. If we consider further that he was in the trying position of sole teacher, and add to this that his temper was constitutionally irritable, it is impossible not to feel true pity for a father who did, and strove to do, so much for his children, who would have so valued their affection, yet who must have been constantly feeling that fear of him was drying it up at its source. This was no longer the case, later in life and with his younger children. They loved him tenderly: and if I cannot say so much of myself, I was always loyally devoted to him. As regards my own education, I hesitate to pronounce whether I was more a loser or gainer by his severity. It was not such as to prevent me from having a happy childhood. And I do not believe, that boys can be induced to apply themselves with vigour, and what is so much more difficult, perseverance, to dry and irksome studies, by the sole force of persuasion and soft words. Much must be done, and much must be learnt, by children, for which rigid discipline, and known liability to punishment, are indispensable as means. It is, no doubt, a very laudable effort, in modern teaching, to render as much as possible of what the young are required to learn, easy and interesting to them. But when this principle is pushed to the length of not requiring them to learn anything but what has been made easy and interesting, one of the chief objects of education is sacrificed. I rejoice in the decline of the old brutal and tyrannical system of teaching, which however did succeed in enforcing habits of application; but the new, as it seems to me, is training up a race of men who will be incapable of doing anything which is disagreeable to them. I do not, then, believe that fear, as an element in education, can be dispensed with; but I am sure that it ought not to be the main element; and when it predominates so much as to preclude love and confidence on the part of the child to those who should be the unreservedly trusted advisers of after years, and perhaps to seal up the fountains of frank and spontaneous communicativeness in the child’s nature, it is an evil for which a large abatement must be made from the benefits, moral and intellectual, which may flow from any other part of the education. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我人生初期的这段时间里，父亲家里的常客很少，大部分不为世人所知。但由于他们的品格高尚，以及或多或少与他意气相投，至少在政治观点上互相投合(因为那时这样的人不如后来常见)，父亲乐于与他们结交，他们的交谈总是让我兴致盎然而又深受启迪。我总是呆在父亲的书房里，因此和他最亲密的朋友大卫.李嘉图很熟，他面容和蔼，举止亲切，对年轻人很有吸引力，我开始学政治经济学后，他邀请我到他家里，和他一起散步，以便讨论这个主题。（大概从1817年或1818年开始）我最常拜访的是休姆先生，他和父亲在苏格兰的同一个地区出生，我倒觉得他是父亲的小学校友或者大学时的朋友，从印度回来后，他们重拾年轻时的友谊，和很多人一样，父亲智力和性格中的活力对他影响很大。这种影响，也是促使他进入议会的部分原因，他在议会里行事所采取的路线方针，使他在自己国家的历史上获得了值得尊敬的地位。至于边沁先生，我见得更多，因为他和父亲关系非常亲密。我不知道父亲第一次来英格兰后多久他们就熟悉了。但是，父亲是第一个完全理解并大体上采纳边沁关于道德规范、政府和法律之总体观点的英国要人。这是他们之间产生共鸣的天然基础，使父亲成为边沁那段人生中接待的为数不多的访客之一，后来边沁接待的访客多了不少。当时，边沁先生每年都会有一阵子在巴罗格林豪斯度过，那是戈德斯通几英里外萨里山上一个很漂亮的地方，我每年夏天都花很长时间陪着父亲在那里作客。1813年，边沁先生、父亲和我一起远足，游览了牛津、巴思、布里斯托尔、埃克塞特、普利茅斯和朴次茅斯。在这次旅行中，我看到了很多对我有启发的东西，第一次领略了自然风光，不过是以对“景色”的喜爱这种初级的形式。同一年冬天，我们搬到离边沁家很近的一所房子里，是父亲从他那里租来的，在威斯敏斯特的女王广场。从1814年到1817年，边沁先生每年有一半的时间住在萨默塞特郡（或者说在被萨默塞特郡环绕着的德文郡）的福特修道院，我间或有幸在那儿小住。我想，这次逗留在我的教育中是很重要的一次经历。宽敞、自由的生活环境，比任何东西都更有助于提升一个民族的情操。这个精致、古老的地方有中世纪的建筑、庄严堂皇的礼堂、宽敞高耸的房间，跟鄙陋、狭隘的英国中产阶级的生活很不一样，给人一种万物更大、更自由的感觉，加之修道院所处庭院的特征，都给我一种诗意的陶冶。这地方风景赏心悦目，幽静隐蔽，绿树成阴，水声潺潺。</td>
		<td class="en">During this first period of my life, the habitual frequenters of my father’s house were limited to a very few persons, most of them little known to the world, but whom personal worth, and more or less of congeniality with at least his political opinions (not so frequently to be met with then as since) inclined him to cultivate; and his conversations with them I listened to with interest and instruction. My being an habitual inmate of my father’s study made me acquainted with the dearest of his friends, David Ricardo, who by his benevolent countenance, and kindliness of manner, was very attractive to young persons, and who after I became a student of political economy, invited me to his house and to walk with him in order to converse on the subject. I was a more frequent visitor (from about 1817 or 1818) to Mr. Hume, who, born in the same part of Scotland as my father, and having been, I rather think, a younger schoolfellow or college companion of his, had on returning from India renewed their youthful acquaintance, and who coming like many others greatly under the influence of my father’s intellect and energy of character, was induced partly by that influence to go into Parliament, and there adopt the line of conduct which has given him an honorable place in the history of his country. Of Mr. Bentham I saw much more, owing to the close intimacy which existed between him and my father. I do not know how soon after my father’s first arrival in England they became acquainted. But my father was the earliest Englishman of any great mark, who thoroughly understood, and in the main adopted, Bentham’s general views of ethics, government, and law: and this was a natural foundation for sympathy between them, and made them familiar companions in a period of Bentham’s life during which he admitted much fewer visitors than was the case subsequently. At this time Mr. Bentham passed some part of every year at Barrow Green House, in a beautiful part of the Surrey hills, a few miles from Godstone, and there I each summer accompanied my father in a long visit. In 1813 Mr. Bentham, my father, and I made an excursion, which included Oxford, Bath and Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth, and Portsmouth. In this journey I saw many things which were instructive to me, and acquired my first taste for natural scenery, in the elementary form of fondness for a “view.” In the succeeding winter we moved into a house very near Mr. Bentham’s, which my father rented from him, in Queen Square, Westminster. From 1814 to 1817 Mr. Bentham lived during half of each year at Ford Abbey, in Somersetshire (or rather in a part of Devonshire surrounded by Somersetshire), which intervals I had the advantage of passing at that place. This sojourn was, I think, an important circumstance in my education. Nothing contributes more to nourish elevation of sentiments in a people, than the large and free character of their habitations. The middleage architecture, the baronial hall, and the spacious and lofty rooms, of this fine old place, so unlike the mean and cramped externals of English middle class life, gave the sentiment of a larger and freer existence, and were to me a sort of poetic cultivation, aided also by the character of the grounds in which the Abbey stood; which were riant and secluded, umbrageous, and full of the sound of falling waters. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我接受的教育中，还有一次幸运的经历，就是在巴黎住了一年，这要感谢边沁先生的兄弟，将军塞缪尔.边沁爵士。在上面提到的游历中，在戈斯波特附近塞缪尔.边沁爵士的家里，我已经见过他和他的家人（他当时是朴次茅斯造船厂的主管），战争结束后不久，他们在福特修道院逗留的几天里也见过面，之后他们去欧洲大陆居住。1820年，他们邀请我去法国南部的家里住了六个月，结果，由于他们和蔼可亲，我最终几乎住了一年。尽管塞缪尔.边沁爵士思考的方式和他杰出的兄弟不一样，但他也有着相当的成就和综合能力，在机械技术上的天分尤为突出。他的妻子，是著名化学家福代斯博士的女儿，她意志坚强，性格果敢，颇有见识，有着和埃奇沃思一样务实、优秀的辨别力。她是这个家的主导人物，这是她应得的，她也非常称职。他们家有一个儿子（是著名的植物学家），三个女儿，最小的差不多比我大两岁。我很感激他们给了我多方面的大量指导，而且像父母一样关心我。1820年5月，我刚到他们家的时候，他们住在波皮南别墅（当时还属于伏尔泰仇敌的一个后裔），在高处俯瞰蒙托邦和图卢兹之间的加龙河平原。我和他们一起去比利牛斯山脉远足，期间在巴涅尔德比戈尔逗留了一阵子，和他们一起到波城、巴约讷和巴涅尔德吕雄旅行，还攀登了南比戈尔峰。这是我第一次接触最壮美的高山景色，给我留下了最深刻的印象，使我平生的品位变得亮丽多彩。10月份，我们继续从图卢兹出发，沿着卡斯特尔和圣蓬斯美丽的山路去蒙彼利埃，塞缪尔爵士刚在蒙彼利埃附近买下了雷斯汀克里尔的房产，位于圣卢普一座孤山的山脚下。在法国居住的这段时间，我熟悉了法语，也熟悉了一般的法国文学。我上了很多种体育课，然而，没有一门很精通。在蒙彼利埃，我去听了科学院非常好的冬季讲座，有安格拉达先生讲的化学，有普罗旺萨尔先生讲的动物学，还有18世纪形而上学杰出的代表人物热尔戈纳先生讲的逻辑学，题目是《科学的哲理》。我还在蒙彼利埃大学的朗泰里克教授的单独指导下，学完了高等数学的课程。但是在这段时间的教育中，最为有利的条件可能要算呼吸了一整年欧洲大陆生活中自由、宜人的空气了。尽管我当时还不能估计，甚至不能清楚地感觉到这个优势，但它却是真实存在的。我对英国生活体验甚少，认识的极少的几个人，也大都是投身公共事业,宽厚、无私的那种人，我在内心深处并不知道英国所谓的社会的粗俗道德风气。虽然没人公开宣称行为的目标当然总是趋于俗气、卑微，但是种种迹象都暗示了人们习惯于认为这理所当然。缺乏高尚的情感，表现为轻蔑地贬低所有高尚情感的展现，人们还拒绝公开承认任何高尚的行为准则（除了少数笃信宗教的人），除非在那些预定的场合，在那种情形下这种宣称被当作服饰和礼节的一部分。我当时还无法了解或评价这种生存方式与法国人生存方式的不同之处，法国人的错误即使同样真实，也完全不同。通过对比可以发现，法国人的情感至少可以说是高尚的，在他们当中，不管是在文学作品还是在个人生活里，情感都是人们交往的通行货币。尽管情感会随着表白而消散，但是由于人们经常表达情感，在这个国度情感总体上还是保持鲜活的，并且还受到同情心的激励，以至于成了大多数人生活中充满生机活力的一部分，并为所有人接受和理解。我那时也不能领会这种理解背后的普通文化，它源自于经常运用情感，并如此传播到欧洲大陆好几个国家受教育最少的阶层中，在某种程度上，所谓的受过良好教育的英国人是不能与之相比的，除了那些责任心非常敏感，因此会经常用智力思考对与错的问题的人。普通英国人对无私的事情不感兴趣，除了偶然这儿或那儿的某些特别的事情，而对自己确实感兴趣的事情，他们也习惯于不和别人交谈，甚至都不怎么和自己交流，我不知道这些是如何使他们的感情和智力的本领都得不到发展的，或者是发展的方向很单一，很有限，并使他们这些被认为是有灵魂的生命退化成了一种消极的存在。所有这一切，我都是很久以后才认识到的。但即使那时，尽管我没有清楚地对自己说出来，我也已经感觉到两个国家的区别，法国人交往时坦荡亲切，而在英国人的生活方式中，每个人都表现得好像别人（很少有例外或者根本没有）是敌人或讨厌的人一样。与英国相比，法国人以及法国国家的性格，不管好的还是不好的地方，确实更易显于表面，在平常的交往中更毫无顾忌地显露出来。但是，只要没有确切的理由对人不友好，法国人的一般习惯是表现出每个人对其他所有人的友好，也期望获得这种感情。在英国，只有在上等或者中上等阶层教养最好的人那里，才能出现这类的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">I owed another of the fortunate circumstances in my education, a year’s residence in France, to Mr. Bentham’s brother, General Sir Samuel Bentham. I had seen Sir Samuel Bentham and his family at their house near Gosport in the course of the tour already mentioned (he being then Superintendant of the Dockyard at Portsmouth) and during a stay of a few days which they made at Ford Abbey shortly after the peace, before going to live on the Continent. In 1820 they invited me for a six months visit to them in the South of France, which their kindness ultimately prolonged to nearly a twelvemonth. Sir Samuel Bentham, though of a character of mind different from that of his illustrious brother, was a man of very considerable attainments and general powers, with a decided genius for mechanical art. His wife, a daughter of the celebrated chemist Dr. Fordyce, was a woman of strong will and decided character, much general knowledge, and great practical good sense of the Edgeworth8 kind: she was the ruling spirit of the household, as she deserved, and was well qualified, to be. Their family consisted of one son (the eminent botanist) and three daughters, the youngest about two years my senior. I am indebted to them for much and various instruction, and for an almost parental interest in my welfare. When I first joined them, in May 1820, they occupied the Château of Pompignan (still belonging to a descendant of Voltaire’s enemy) on the heights overlooking the plain of the Garonne between Montauban and Toulouse. I accompanied them in an excursion to the Pyrenees, including a stay of some duration at Bagnères de Bigorre, a journey to Pau, Bayonne, and Bagnères de Luchon, and an ascent of the Pic du Midi de Bigorre. This first introduction to the highest order of mountain scenery made the deepest impression on me, and gave a colour to my tastes through life. In October we proceeded by the beautiful mountain route of Castres and St. Pons, from Toulouse to Montpellier, in which last neighbourhood Sir Samuel had just bought the estate of Restinclière, near the foot of the singular mountain of St. Loup. During this residence in France I acquired a familiar knowledge of the French language, and acquaintance with the ordinary French literature; I took lessons in various bodily exercises, in none of which however I made any proficiency; and at Montpellier I attended the excellent winter courses of lectures at the Faculté des Sciences, those of M. Anglada on chemistry, of M. Provençal on zoology, and of a very accomplished representative of the eighteenth century metaphysics, M. Gergonne, on logic, under the name of Philosophy of the Sciences. I also went through a course of the higher mathematics under the private tuition of M. Lenthéric, a professor at the Lycée of Montpellier. But the greatest, perhaps, of the many advantages which I owed to this episode in my education, was that of having breathed for a whole year the free and genial atmosphere of Continental life. This advantage was not the less real though I could not then estimate, nor even consciously feel it. Having so little experience of English life, and the few people I knew being mostly such as had public objects, of a large and personally disinterested kind, at heart, I was ignorant of the low moral tone of what, in England, is called society; the habit of, not indeed professing, but taking for granted in every mode of implication, that conduct is of course always directed towards low and petty objects; the absence of high feelings which manifests itself by sneering depreciation of all demonstrations of them, and by general abstinence (except among a few of the stricter religionists) from professing any high principles of action at all, except in those preordained cases in which such profession is put on as part of the costume and formalities of the occasion. I could not then know or estimate the difference between this manner of existence, and that of a people like the French, whose faults, if equally real, are at all events different; among whom sentiments, which by comparison at least may be called elevated, are the current coin of human intercourse, both in books and in private life; and though often evaporating in profession, are yet kept alive in the nation at large by constant exercise, and stimulated by sympathy, so as to form a living and active part of the existence of great numbers of persons, and to be recognized and understood by all. Neither could I then appreciate the general culture of the understanding, which results from the habitual exercise of the feelings, and is thus carried down into the most uneducated classes of several countries on the Continent, in a degree not equalled in England among the so called educated, except where an unusual tenderness of conscience leads to a habitual exercise of the intellect on questions of right and wrong. I did not know the way in which, among the ordinary English, the absence of interest in things of an unselfish kind, except occasionally in a special thing here and there, and the habit of not speaking to others, nor much even to themselves, about the things in which they do feel interest, causes both their feelings and their intellectual faculties to remain undeveloped, or develop themselves only in some single and very limited direction; reducing them, considered as spiritual beings, to a kind of negative existence. All these things I did not perceive till long afterwards; but I even then felt, though without stating it clearly to myself, the contrast between the frank sociability and amiability of French personal intercourse, and the English mode of existence in which everybody acts as if everybody else (with few, or no, exceptions) was either an enemy or a bore. In France, it is true, the bad as well as the good points both of individual and of national character come more to the surface, and break out more fearlessly in ordinary intercourse, than in England: but the general habit of the people is to show, as well as to expect, friendly feeling in every one towards every other, wherever there is not some positive cause for the opposite. In England it is only of the best bred people, in the upper or upper middle ranks, that anything like this can be said. </td></tr>

He lived a quiet and studious life, made happy by warm affections, public and private. He was acquainted with many of the chiefs of the Liberal party, and I saw various noteworthy persons while staying at his house; among whom I have pleasure in the recollection of having once seen Saint-Simon, not yet the founder either of a philosophy or a religion, and considered only as a clever original. The chief fruit which I carried away from the society I saw, was a strong and permanent interest in Continental Liberalism, of which I ever afterwards kept myself au courant, as much as of English politics: a thing not at all usual in those days with Englishmen, and which had a very salutary influence on my development, keeping me free from the error always prevalent in England, and from which even my father with all his superiority to prejudice was not exempt, of judging universal questions by a merely English standard.

		<td class="en">For the first year or two after my visit to France, I continued my old studies, with the addition of some new ones. When I returned, my father was just finishing for the press his Elements of Political Economy, and he made me perform an exercise on the manuscript, which Mr. Bentham practised on all his own writings, making what he called “marginal contents;” a short abstract of every paragraph, to enable the writer more easily to judge of, and improve, the order of the ideas, and the general character of the exposition. Soon after, my father put into my hands Condillac’s Traité des Sensations, and the logical and metaphysical volumes of his Cours d’Etudes; the first (notwithstanding the superficial resemblance between Condillac’s psychological system and my father’s) quite as much for a warning as for an example. I am not sure whether it was in this winter or the next that I first read a history of the French Revolution. I learnt with astonishment, that the principles of democracy, then apparently in so insignificant and hopeless a minority everywhere in Europe, had borne all before them in France thirty years earlier, and had been the creed of the nation. As may be supposed from this, I had previously a very vague idea of that great commotion. I knew only that the French had thrown off the absolute monarchy of Louis XIV and XV, had put the King and Queen to death, guillotined many persons, one of whom was Lavoisier1, and had ultimately fallen under the despotism of Bonaparte2. From this time, as was natural, the subject took an immense hold of my feelings. It allied itself with all my juvenile aspirations to the character of a democratic champion. What had happened so lately, seemed as if it might easily happen again: and the most transcendent glory I was capable of conceiving, was that of figuring, successful or unsuccessful, as a Girondist3 in an English Convention.</td></tr>

With Mr. Austin I read Heineccius on the Institutes, his Roman Antiquities, and part of his exposition of the Pandects; to which was added a considerable portion of Blackstone. It was at the commencement of these studies that my father, as a needful accompaniment to them, put into my hands Bentham’s principal speculations, as interpreted to the Continent, and indeed to all the world, by Dumont, in the Traité de Législation.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从某种意义上讲，我之前的教育，学的就已经是功利主义了。我一直被教导着去应用“最大幸福”的功利主义标准。我甚至熟悉关于功利主义的一次抽象讨论，是父亲未发表的《论政府》对话中的一段，讨论的是柏拉图模式。然而，边沁书中的前几页，充满了新奇的力量，让我眼前一亮。像这样让我印象深刻的是边沁评价道德和立法中的一般推理方式的那一章。这种推理是从“自然法则”“正确推理”“是非感”以及“天赋公正”之类的语句中推断出来的，边沁认为它们是伪装的教条主义，以空洞的口号当幌子，把观点强加到别人身上，但这些口号根本没有为这种观点传达理由，反而把观点本身当作理由。我之前从未想到过边沁的原则会结束所有这一切。我突然感觉到，以前的所有伦理学家都被他取代了，而在这儿，思想上的一个新纪元真正开始了。边沁把幸福原则应用于道德行为，通过分析各种类型的后果和它们的次序，使这一应用以科学的形式呈现出来，这种方式进一步加强了我的那种感觉。但是，当时最让我惊讶的是《犯罪分类》，而杜蒙以边沁的原作为基础写的《犯罪分类》（修订本），要比原作要清楚、简洁得多，让人印象深刻。柏拉图的逻辑学和辩证法，在我之前的训练中占据了相当大的比重，让我对精确分类非常感兴趣。这种爱好，由于依据自然方法的一些原则学习植物学而得以加强和启迪。我在法国暂住的时候，就满腔热情地开始运用自然方法，尽管只是作为一种消遣。当我发现，在快乐与痛苦的后果这一道德原则的指导下，把科学的分类应用于伟大、复杂的主题——该罚的行为，按照边沁引入这些主题的具体方法贯彻执行时，我觉得被提升到一种能俯瞰广阔的精神领域的高度，还能展望到无法估算的智力成果。随着探讨继续深入，在这种智力清晰之外，我似乎还看到了最鼓舞人心的人类事务切实进步的前景。边沁对于构建立法体系的总体思想，我并不十分陌生，因为我认真地读过父亲的文章《法理学》，这是篇极好的概论。但是，我没有多少收获，也几乎完全不感兴趣，无疑因为它太概括，太抽象，也因为它更关注民法的形式而非实质，逻辑而非法律伦理。但是，边沁的主题是立法，法理学只是其中的形式方面。人的观念和制度应该是什么样的，如何让它们变成该有的样子，以及现在它们都偏离了多少，在每一页上，他似乎都让这些概念更加清楚和明朗。当我放下《立法论》的最后一卷时，我已经脱胎换骨了。边沁所理解和应用的“功利原则”，就和在这三卷书中理解和应用的方式一样，它恰到好处地成为了把我的知识和信念中支离破碎的部分整合起来的基础。它把我对事物的概念统一起来。我现在有了主张；有了信条、学说和哲学体系；有了宗教，取宗教一词的最佳意义；有了可向他人灌输并传播的东西，由此可订立人生主要的外在目标。而且，在我面前有了一个宏大的设想，就是用那个学说改变人类的境遇。在我看来，《立法论》的结尾，描绘了人类生活最感人的画卷，用论文中建议的那些观点和法律就能创造出这样的生活。它对切实可行的进步的预期是谨慎、适度的，轻视并反对很多将来有一天对人类来说会很自然的事情，觉得那是由茫然的热情产生的幻想，但对那些曾认为它们异想天开的人来说，不公正可能会在他们身上发生。但是，在我的思想状态中，这种高于幻想的想象，通过加深精神力量的影响，强化了边沁的学说对我产生的影响。他向我展现的改良的前景，宏大而壮美，足以点燃我的人生，明确我的抱负。</td>
		<td class="en">My previous education had been, in a certain sense, already a course of Benthamism4. The Benthamic standard of “the greatest happiness” was that which I had always been taught to apply; I was even familiar with an abstract discussion of it, forming an episode in an unpublished dialogue on Government, written by my father on the Platonic model. Yet in the first pages of Bentham it burst upon me with all the force of novelty. What thus impressed me was the chapter in which Bentham passed judgment on the common modes of reasoning in morals and legislation, deduced from phrases like “law of nature,” “right reason,” “the moral sense,” “natural rectitude,” and the like, and characterized them as dogmatism in disguise, imposing its sentiments upon others under cover of sounding expressions which convey no reason for the sentiment, but set up the sentiment as its own reason. It had not struck me before, that Bentham’s principle put an end to all this. The feeling rushed upon me, that all previous moralists were superseded, and that here indeed was the commencement of a new era in thought. This impression was strengthened by the manner in which Bentham put into scientific form the application of the happiness principle to the morality of actions, by analysing the various classes and orders of their consequences. But what struck me at that time most of all, was the Classification of Offences; which is much more clear, compact, and imposing, in Dumont’s rédaction than in the original work of Bentham from which it was taken. Logic and the dialectics of Plato, which had formed so large a part of my previous training, had given me a strong relish for accurate classification. This taste had been strengthened and enlightened by the study of botany, on the principles of what is called the Natural Method, which I had taken up with great zeal, though only as an amusement, during my stay in France; and when I found scientific classification applied to the great and complex subject of Punishable Acts, under the guidance of the ethical principle of Pleasurable and Painful Consequences, followed out in the method of detail introduced into these subjects by Bentham, I felt taken up to an eminence from which I could survey a vast mental domain, and see stretching out into the distance intellectual results beyond all computation. As I proceeded further, there seemed to be added to this intellectual clearness, the most inspiring prospects of practical improvement in human affairs. To Bentham’s general views of the construction of a body of law I was not altogether a stranger, having read with attention that admirable compendium, my father’s article “Jurisprudence”: but I had read it with little profit, and scarcely any interest, no doubt from its extremely general and abstract character, and also because it concerned the form more than the substance of the corpus juris, the logic rather than the ethics of law. But Bentham’s subject was Legislation, of which Jurisprudence is only the formal part: and at every page he seemed to open a clearer and broader conception of what human opinions and institutions ought to be, how they might be made what they ought to be, and how far removed from it they now are. When I laid down the last volume of the Traité I had become a different being. The “principle of utility” understood as Bentham understood it, and applied in the manner in which he applied it through these three volumes, fell exactly into its place as the keystone which held together the detached and fragmentary component parts of my knowledge and beliefs. It gave unity to my conceptions of things. I now had opinions; a creed, a doctrine, a philosophy; in one among the best senses of the word, a religion; the inculcation and diffusion of which could be made the principal outward purpose of a life. And I had a grand conception laid before me of changes to be effected in the condition of mankind through that doctrine. The Traité de Législation wound up with what was to me a most impressive picture of human life as it would be made by such opinions and such laws as were recommended in the treatise. The anticipations of practicable improvement were studiously moderate, deprecating and discountenancing as reveries of vague enthusiasm many things which will one day seem so natural to human beings, that injustice will probably be done to those who once thought them chimerical. But, in my state of mind, this appearance of superiority to illusion added to the effect which Bentham’s doctrines produced on me, by heightening the impression of mental power. And the vista of improvement which he did open was sufficiently large and brilliant to light up my life, as well as to give a definite shape to my aspirations. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这之后，我时不时地读边沁其他问世作品中最重要的一些，有的是他自己写的，有的是杜蒙编辑的。这是我的个人阅读，另外，在父亲的指导下，我的学习进入到分析心理学的更高分支。我现在读了洛克的《随笔》，并写了报告，包括每一章的完整摘要，加上我想到的评论。父亲读了报告后，或者（我认为）我读给他听了之后，就从头到尾讨论一遍。我以同样的方式读了爱尔维修《论精神》，这本书是我自选的。在父亲的督导之下准备这些摘要对我特别有用，因为在思考和表达心理学学说时，不管是视其为真理还是仅认为是别人的观点，都必须精确。读完爱尔维修之后，父亲让我攻读哈特利的《对人的观察》，他认为这是精神心理学领域真正的大师级作品。这本书，尽管不像《立法论》那样给我的生活增添新的色彩，但是它的主题，也给我留下了类似的深刻印象。哈特利运用联系法解释更为复杂的精神现象，虽然在很多地方都不全面，但作为真正的分析，马上就引起了我的兴趣，让我通过对比感觉到，孔狄亚克仅仅拘泥于文字归纳的不足，甚至洛克在阐释心理学时有益的探索和感想也有不足。就在这时，父亲开始着手写《精神分析》，用的是哈特利的精神现象阐述模式，但更全面，更深刻。他只能在每年一个月或者六个星期的假期里，完全闲着的时候，才能集中必需的精力做这项工作。他是1822年夏天开始写的，那是他第一次在多金度假。从那时起到他去世，除了有两年之外，只要职责允许，他每年都在那个地方住上半年。连续好几个假期，他都用来写《精神分析》，直到1829年发表。随着他的进展，他允许我逐步地读该书的手稿。精神心理学领域的其他主要英语作家的作品，我只读了我喜欢的，尤其是贝克莱、休谟的《随笔》、里德、杜格尔德.斯图尔特以及布朗的《因果论》。两三年后我才读布朗的《演讲集》，当时连我父亲也没有读过。</td>
		<td class="en">After this I read, from time to time, the most important of the other works of Bentham which had then seen the light, either as written by himself or as edited by Dumont. This was my private reading: while, under my father’s direction, my studies were carried into the higher branches of analytic psychology. I now read Locke5’s Essay, and wrote out an account of it, consisting of a complete abstract of every chapter, with such remarks as occurred to me: which was read by, or (I think) to, my father, and discussed throughout. I performed the same process with Helvetius6 De l’Esprit, which I read of my own choice. This preparation of abstracts, subject to my father’s censorship, was of great service to me, by compelling precision in conceiving and expressing psychological doctrines, whether accepted as truths or only regarded as the opinions of others. After Helvetius, my father made me study what he deemed the really master-production in the philosophy of mind, Hartley’s Observations on Man. This book, though it did not, like the Traité de Législation, give a new colour to my existence, made a very similar impression on me in regard to its immediate subject. Hartley’s explanation, incomplete as in many points it is, of the more complex mental phenomena by the law of association, commended itself to me at once as a real analysis, and made me feel by contrast the insufficiency of the merely verbal generalizations of Condillac, and even of the instructive gropings and feelings about for psychological explanations, of Locke. It was at this very time that my father commenced writing his Analysis of the Mind, which carried Hartley’s mode of explaining the mental phenomena to so much greater length and depth. He could only command the concentration of thought necessary for this work, during the complete leisure of his holiday of a month or six weeks annually; and he commenced it in the summer of 1822, in the first holiday he passed at Dorking; in which neighbourhood, from that time to the end of his life, with the exception of two years, he lived, as far as his official duties permitted, for six months of every year. He worked at the Analysis during several successive vacations, up to the year 1829 when it was published, and allowed me to read the manuscript, portion by portion, as it advanced. The other principal English writers on mental philosophy I read as I felt inclined, particularly Berkeley7, Hume’s Essays, Reid8, Dugald Stewart9 and Brown on Cause and Effect. Brown’s Lectures I did not read until two or three years later, nor at that time had my father himself read them. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一年间，我读了一些对我的发展有实质性作用的著作，这当中我应该提到一本书，名为《自然宗教对人类现世幸福影响的分析》（以边沁的一些手稿为基础写的，用菲利浦.比彻姆的笔名出版）。这本书不是检验最普遍意义上的宗教信仰的真伪，而是检验它是否有用，以及是否有任何特别的《启示录》的特性。这本书中所有和宗教有关的讨论，都是这个时代最重要的，在这个时代，对任何宗教教义的真正信仰都是无益的，靠不住的。但是认为宗教对实现道德和社会目标是必要的几乎是一个普遍认可的观点。那些拒绝神的启示的人，一般都寻求乐观的自然神论作庇护，即崇拜大自然的秩序和天道，这至少与任何形式的基督教一样充满矛盾，并堕落成道德情感，只是没有被完全认识到。然而，怀疑这种形式信仰有用的人，只写了很少称得上带有任何哲学性质的作品。以菲利普.比彻姆的名义写的书，就以此为特定目标。父亲看过手稿后，把它交给我，我在页边缘上作了分析，就像读《政治经济学要义》的时候一样。这本书分析很透彻，是继《立法论》之后对我产生最大影响的书籍之一。很多年后重读这本书的时候，我发现了它功利主义思考模式的一些缺点和优点，我现在觉得，它也有很多缺乏说服力的论证，但是也有很多合理的论证和好材料，可以用来对这个主题进行更全面的哲理性和总结性的处理。</td>
		<td class="en">Among the works read in the course of this year, which contributed materially to my development, I ought to mention a book (written on the foundation of some of Bentham’s manuscripts and published under the pseudonyme of Philip Beauchamp) entitled Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind. This was an examination not of the truth, but of the usefulness of religious belief, in the most general sense, apart from the peculiarities of any special Revelation; which, of all the parts of the discussion concerning religion, is the most important in this age, in which real belief in any religious doctrine is feeble and precarious, but the opinion of its necessity for moral and social purposes almost universal; and when those who reject revelation, very generally take refuge in an optimistic Deism, a worship of the order of Nature, and the supposed course of Providence, at least as full of contradictions, and perverting to the moral sentiments, as any of the forms of Christianity, if only it is as completely realized. Yet, very little, with any claim to a philosophical character, has been written by sceptics against the usefulness of this form of belief. The volume bearing the name of Philip Beauchamp had this for its special object. Having been shewn to my father in manuscript, it was put into my hands by him, and I made a marginal analysis of it as I had done of the Elements of Political Economy. Next to the Traité de Législation, it was one of the books which by the searching character of its analysis produced the greatest effect upon me. On reading it lately after an interval of many years, I find it to have some of the defects as well as the merits of the Benthamic modes of thought, and to contain, as I now think, many weak arguments, but with a great overbalance of sound ones, and much good material for a more completely philosophic and conclusive treatment of the subject. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至此，对我早期的智力发展有任何重要影响的书籍，我相信已经都提到了。从这时起，与读书相比，我开始主要通过写作来继续进行智力培养。1822年夏天，我写了第一篇议论文。我已经不怎么记得这篇文章了，只记得它是抨击我理解的贵族化偏见，即认为富人在道德素质上高于穷人，或者很可能高于穷人。我所写的完全是在论证，没有任何慷慨陈词，这种主题其实是允许激辩的，而且年轻作者可能也会被建议这么做。然而，我在这方面一直不擅长。朴素的论证是我唯一能把握的，或者说乐意尝试的。然而，我很容易被动地受到在理性的基础上打动人心的文学作品的影响，不管是诗歌还是演说。直到我写完之后，父亲才知道有这篇文章，他非常满意，而且，我还从别人那里听说，他甚至非常高兴。但是，可能他希望我提高其他智力能力，而不仅仅是逻辑能力，所以，建议我接下来练习写一篇演说类的文章。对于这个建议，我利用自己熟悉希腊历史和思想以及雅典演说家这个优势，写了两篇演说，一篇是谴责伯里克利，另一篇是为他辩护，假设他由于没有出兵攻打入侵阿提卡的斯巴达人而遭到了指责。这之后，我继续写一些主题经常大大超出我能力的论文，但是，不管是从练习本身，还是从由此而与父亲进行的讨论中，我都收获颇多。</td>
		<td class="en">I have now, I believe, mentioned all the books which had any considerable effect on my early mental development. From this point I began to carry on my intellectual cultivation by writing still more than by reading. In the summer of 1822 I wrote my first argumentative essay. I remember very little about it, except that it was an attack on what I regarded as the aristocratic prejudice, that the rich were, or were likely to be, superior in moral qualities to the poor. My performance was entirely argumentative, without any of the declamation which the subject would admit of, and might be expected to suggest to a young writer. In that department however I was, and remained, very inapt. Dry argument was the only thing I could manage, or willingly attempted; though passively I was very susceptible to the effect of all composition, whether in the form of poetry or oratory, which appealed to the feelings on any basis of reason. My father, who knew nothing of this essay until it was finished, was well satisfied, and as I learnt from others, even pleased with it; but, perhaps from a desire to promote the exercise of other mental faculties than the purely logical, he advised me to make my next exercise in composition one of the oratorical kind: on which suggestion, availing myself of my familiarity with Greek history and ideas and with the Athenian orators, I wrote two speeches, one an accusation, the other a defence of Pericles10, on a supposed impeachment for not marching out to fight the Lacedemonians on their invasion of Attica. After this I continued to write papers on subjects often very much beyond my capacity, but with great benefit both from the exercise itself, and from the discussions which it led to with my father. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，我也已经开始与接触到的博学者讨论一般性的问题，这种接触的机会也自然变得更频繁起来。从父亲的两个朋友，格罗特先生和约翰.奥斯丁先生那里，我收获最多，与他们的交往也最多。他们和我父亲都认识不久，但他们的关系很快就由认识变为熟识了。格罗特先生是李嘉图先生介绍给父亲认识的，我想是在1819年（那时他差不多25岁），他一心寻求与父亲交往。尽管他已经是个非常博学的人了，但在父亲面前，对于人类观点这样重大的主题，他仍是个初学者；但是，他能很快地抓住父亲思想的精华。在政治观点方面，早在1820年，他就因为答复詹姆斯.麦金托什爵士的著名论文，写了篇为“激进改革”辩护的论文而为人所知，这篇论文最近发表在《爱丁堡评论》上。格罗特先生的父亲是个银行家，我认为是个十足的保守派，他的母亲是个虔诚的基督教福音派教徒，所以他的自由观点绝非来自家庭的影响。但是，和大多数将来能够靠继承遗产而富有的人不同，他虽然积极参与银行业务，但还是把自己的很大一部分时间投入到了哲学研究中。他和我父亲的熟识，在很大程度上决定了他思想发展下一阶段的特点。我经常拜访他，和他探讨政治、道德和哲学话题，除了很宝贵的指导外，与他这样一个智力过人、道德高尚的人意气相投地交流，还给我带来了很多快乐和益处。他过人的思想和高尚的道德，从那时起，已经通过他的生活和作品展现在了世人面前。</td>
		<td class="en">I had now also begun to converse, on general subjects, with the instructed men with whom I came in contact: and the opportunities of such contact naturally became more numerous. The two friends of my father from whom I derived most, and with whom I most associated, were Mr. Grote11 and Mr. John Austin. The acquaintance of both with my father was recent, but had ripened rapidly into intimacy. Mr. Grote was introduced to my father by Mr. Ricardo, I think in 1819, (being then about twenty-five years old), and sought assiduously his society and conversation. Already a highly instructed man, he was yet, by the side of my father, a tyro in the great subjects of human opinion; but he rapidly seized on my father’s best ideas; and in the department of political opinion he made himself known as early as 1820, by a pamphlet in defence of Radical Reform, in reply to a celebrated article by Sir James Mackintosh, then lately published in the Edinburgh Review. Mr. Grote’s father, the banker, was, I believe, a thorough Tory, and his mother intensely Evangelical; so that for his liberal opinions he was in no way indebted to home influences. But, unlike most persons who have the prospect of being rich by inheritance, he had, though actively engaged in the business of banking, devoted a great portion of time to philosophic studies; and his intimacy with my father did much to decide the character of the next stage in his mental progress. Him I often visited, and my conversations with him on political, moral, and philosophical subjects gave me, in addition to much valuable instruction, all the pleasure and benefit of sympathetic communion with a man of the high intellectual and moral eminence which his life and writings have since manifested to the world. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >奥斯丁先生比格罗特先生大四五岁，是萨福克郡一个退休磨坊主的长子。在战争中，这位父亲靠承包赚了不少钱，我推断他肯定是个品质出众的人，因为他的儿子能力都不一般，都是优秀的绅士。我们现在关注的这位，因他的法学作品而著名，他曾经有一段时间从军，在威廉·本廷克勋爵的麾下，在西西里服过役。战争结束后，他卖了军衔，开始学习法律，父亲认识他之前，他就已经当了一段时间的律师了。他和格罗特先生不一样，根本不是我父亲的学生，而是通过阅读和思考，获得了很多和我父亲相同的观点，辅之以他性格中坚定的个性。他这个人才智突出，通过对话最能展现出来。在讨论得很兴奋的时候，他惯于用有力、华美的言辞，坚持非常普通的主题中的某个观点。他的外貌表现出的不仅是强硬，而且还有谨慎和冷静的意志，也夹杂着某种尖酸，部分源于性格，部分源于他的情感和思索的总体特征。每一个有判断力、非常负责的思想家，在目前的社会和智力状态下，都或多或少感觉到对生活和世界不满，而在他这儿这种不满让他的性格带上相当忧郁的色彩，这对于消极的道德情感压倒积极活力的人来说，是很自然的现象。因为必须承认，他的风格似乎强有力地证明了他的意志力，然而，他的意志力也仅止于其风格。他非常热心人类的进步，有很强的责任感，还有他留下来的那些作品，足以证明他的能力和成就的水平，但他几乎从没完成任何有重大意义的智力作品。对于应该做的事情，他的标准如此之高，总觉得自己的表现有缺点，不满足于对情形和意图而言已经足够的详尽阐述，以至于不仅对很多用途普通的工作太过细心却损毁了它们，而且还把很多时间和精力花在多余的研究和思考上。因此，当他的任务需要完成的时候，他通常已经积劳成疾了，而工作一半都没有完成。由于这种心理弱点（在我认识的有成就和有才干的人当中，他并不是唯一的例子），加上经常生病（这些病虽然不致命，但也损害身体能力），与他看起来能做到的相比，他一生的成就很小。但是，对于他确实创作出来的东西，最称职的鉴定人也会给予他非常高的评价。和柯尔律治一样，他可以为自己辩护，说通过交谈他不仅为许多人提供了很多指导，还大大提升了他们的品质。他对我的影响非常有益。那是最佳意义上的道德影响。他对我的关心很诚挚友善，一个寻常的年轻人很难想象从像他这种年龄、地位以及看似性格严厉的人那里获得这种关心。他的言谈和举止中有一种高尚的风格，在当时我所认识的人当中，即使有人有同样的品质，也不会像在他身上展现出来的那么多。从与他的交往当中，我收益更多，因为他和我经常拜访的知识分子都不是一个思想类型的。而且，对于仅由一种思想模式或者一种社会圈子塑造的年轻人几乎必然会有的偏见和狭隘，他从一开始就果断地反对。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Austin, who was four or five years older than Mr. Grote, was the eldest son of a retired miller in Suffolk, who had made money by contracts during the war, and who must have been a man of remarkable qualities, as I infer from the fact that all his sons were of more than common ability and all eminently gentlemen. The one with whom we are now concerned, and whose writings on jurisprudence have made him celebrated, was for some time in the army, and served in Sicily under Lord William Bentinck. After the peace he sold his commission and studied for the bar, to which he had been called for some time before my father knew him. He was not, like Mr. Grote, to any extent, a pupil of my father, but he had attained, by reading and thought, a considerable number of the same opinions, modified by his own very decided individuality of character. He was a man of great intellectual powers which in conversation appeared at their very best; from the vigour and richness of expression with which, under the excitement of discussion, he was accustomed to maintain some view or other of most general subjects; and from an appearance of not only strong, but deliberate and collected will; mixed with a certain bitterness, partly derived from temperament, and partly from the general cast of his feelings and reflections. The dissatisfaction with life and the world, felt more or less in the present state of society and intellect by every discerning and highly conscientious mind, gave in his case a rather melancholy tinge to the character, very natural to those whose passive moral susceptibilities are more than proportioned to their active energies. For it must be said, that the strength of will of which his manner seemed to give such strong assurance, expended itself principally in manner. With great zeal for human improvement, a strong sense of duty, and capacities and acquirements the extent of which is proved by the writings he has left, he hardly ever completed any intellectual task of magnitude. He had so high a standard of what ought to be done, so exaggerated a sense of deficiencies in his own performances, and was so unable to content himself with the amount of elaboration sufficient for the occasion and the purpose, that he not only spoiled much of his work for ordinary use by overlabouring it, but spent so much time and exertion in superfluous study and thought, that when his task ought to have been completed, he had generally worked himself into an illness, without having half finished what he undertook. From this mental infirmity (of which he is not the sole example among the accomplished and able men whom I have known), combined with liability to frequent attacks of disabling though not dangerous ill-health, he accomplished, through life, little in comparison with what he seemed capable of; but what he did produce is held in the very highest estimation by the most competent judges; and, like Coleridge12, he might plead as a set-off that he had been to many persons, through his conversation, a source not only of much instruction but of great elevation of character. On me his influence was most salutary. It was moral in the best sense. He took a sincere and kind interest in me, far beyond what could have been expected towards a mere youth from a man of his age, standing, and what seemed austerity of character. There was in his conversation and demeanour a tone of highmindedness which did not show itself so much, if the quality existed as much, in any of the other persons with whom at that time I associated. My intercourse with him was the more beneficial, owing to his being of a different mental type from all other intellectual men whom I frequented, and he from the first set himself decidedly against the prejudices and narrownesses which are almost sure to be found in a young man formed by a particular mode of thought or a particular social circle. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当时以及接下来的一两年里，我经常见到他的弟弟查尔斯.奥斯丁，他对我的影响也很大，尽管类型很不相同。他比我只大几岁，那时刚大学毕业。在大学里，他光芒四射，是位有识之士、才华横溢的演讲家和谈话专家。他对剑桥同辈们产生的影响堪称具有历史性意义。因为通常意义上的自由主义风潮，尤其是它的功利主义和政治经济学形式，可以部分追溯到此。从这时起到1830年，这种风潮在一部分上层社会思想较活跃的年轻人中展现出来。联合辩论协会当时正处于名声鼎盛时期，在这个活动场所里，当时被认为很极端的政治和哲学观点每星期都会被拿来和对手面对面地辩论，而观众里有剑桥的年轻精英。虽然很多后来或多或少有些名望的人（其中，麦考利勋爵是最著名的），是在这些辩论中首次摘得演说的桂冠，但这些高智商的辩论者中，真正有影响力的还是查尔斯.奥斯丁。离开大学后，他的谈话技巧和个人魅力使得他仍然是大学里与他熟识那一阶层年轻人的领袖。他让我和别人一起，加入了他的行列。通过他，我结识了麦考利、海德、查尔斯.维利尔斯，斯特拉特(现在是贝尔珀勋爵)和罗米利（现在是罗米利勋爵，上诉院保管案卷的法官），还有很多后来因文学或政治而出名的人。我听到他们讨论很多话题，在某种程度上来说，我对这些话题还不熟悉。查尔斯.奥斯丁对我的影响跟我迄今为止提到的其他人不一样，不是成年人对小孩子的影响，而是年龄稍长的同代人的影响。通过他，我第一次感觉到自己不是老师的小学生，而是成人中的一员。他是我见到的第一个高智商的平辈人，我们是平等的，虽然在这平等的基础上我比他逊色很多。他会给任何与他接触过的人留下深刻印象，即使他们的观点与他完全相反。他给人的印象是有无穷的力量和才干，结合他显而易见的意志和性格的力量，似乎能主宰世界。那些熟悉他的人，不管对他是否友好，都预料他会在公众生活中发挥显著作用。很少有人能通过演说产生这么大的直接影响，除非他们在某种程度上是精心准备了而且用了功的。他喜欢给人留下深刻印象，甚至让人震惊。他知道，果断是效果的最大因素，他表达观点时，尽力把所有果断融入其中。他最高兴的时候，就是他的观点因为大胆创新而让人大吃一惊的时候。他和哥哥很不一样，他哥哥坚决反对过于狭隘地解释和应用两人都公开承认的原则，恰恰相反，他以功利主义学说所能承受的最惊人的方式阐述这一学说，夸大学说中任何倾向于冒犯人们原有情感的东西。他充满活力地为这一切辩护，以令人愉快又有说服力的态度应付局面，因此他经常成为胜者，或者分享胜者的荣誉。我坚信，流行的边沁主义者或功利主义者的原则和看法中的很多观念，都源于查尔斯.奥斯丁提出的看似矛盾而实际可能正确的说法。然而，必须承认，改变了信仰的年轻人步履蹒跚地仿效他的做法，夸大功利主义教条和准则中所有大家都认为有冒犯性的东西，曾有一段时间这成为了一个小圈子年轻人的标志。那些有些天分的人，包括我自己，很快就抛弃了这种孩子气的虚荣心；而没有天分的人，逐渐厌倦了与别人唱反调，放弃了他们坚持过一段时间的非主流观点，不管是好的还是坏的部分。</td>
		<td class="en">His younger brother, Charles Austin, of whom at this time and for the next year or two I saw much, had also a great effect on me, though of a very different description. He was but a few years older than myself, and had then just left the University, where he had shone with great éclat as a man of intellect and a brilliant orator and converser. The effect he produced on his Cambridge contemporaries deserves to be accounted an historical event; for to it may in part be traced the tendency towards Liberalism in general, and the Benthamic and politico-economic form of it in particular, which showed itself in a portion of the more active-minded young men of the higher classes from this time to 1830. The Union Debating Society, at that time at the height of its reputation, was an arena where what were then thought extreme opinions, in politics and philosophy, were weekly asserted, face to face with their opposites, before audiences consisting of the élite of the Cambridge youth: and though many persons afterwards of more or less note, (of whom Lord Macaulay is the most celebrated), gained their first oratorical laurels in those debates, the really influential mind among these intellectual gladiators was Charles Austin. He continued, after leaving the University, to be, by his conversation and personal ascendancy, a leader among the same class of young men who had been his associates there; and he attached me among others to his car. Through him I became acquainted with Macaulay13, Hyde and Charles Villiers, Strutt (now Lord Belper), Romilly (now Lord Romilly and Master of the Rolls), and various others who subsequently figured in literature or politics, and among whom I heard discussions on many topics, as yet to a certain degree new to me. The influence of Charles Austin over me differed from that of the persons I have hitherto mentioned, in being not the influence of a man over a boy, but that of an elder contemporary. It was through him that I first felt myself, not a pupil under teachers, but a man among men. He was the first person of intellect whom I met on a ground of equality, though as yet much his inferior on that common ground. He was a man who never failed to impress greatly those with whom he came in contact, even when their opinions were the very reverse of his. The impression he gave was that of boundless strength, together with talents which, combined with such apparent force of will and character, seemed capable of dominating the world. Those who knew him, whether friendly to him or not, always anticipated that he would play a conspicuous part in public life. It is seldom that men produce so great an immediate effect by speech, unless they, in some degree, lay themselves out for it; and he did this in no ordinary degree. He loved to strike, and even to startle. He knew that decision is the greatest element of effect, and he uttered his opinions with all the decision he could throw into them, never so well pleased as when he astonished any one by their audacity. Very unlike his brother, who made war against the narrower interpretations and applications of the principles they both professed, he on the contrary, presented the Benthamic doctrines in the most startling form of which they were susceptible, exaggerating everything in them which tended to consequences offensive to any one’s preconceived feelings. All which, he defended with such verve and vivacity, and carried off by a manner so agreeable as well as forcible, that he always either came off victor, or divided the honours of the field. It is my belief that much of the notion popularly entertained of the tenets and sentiments of what are called Benthamites or Utilitarians had its origin in paradoxes thrown out by Charles Austin. It must be said, however, that his example was followed, haud passibus aequis, by younger proselytes, and that to outrer whatever was by anybody considered offensive in the doctrines and maxims of Benthamism, became at one time the badge of a small coterie of youths. All of these who had anything in them, myself among others, quickly outgrew this boyish vanity; and those who had not, became tired of differing from other people, and gave up both the good and the bad part of the heterodox opinions they had for some time professed. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1822年冬天，我制定了建立一个小型学会的计划。这个学会由认同基本原则的年轻人组成，即认可效用为他们道德规范和政治观点的标准，认可我所接受的哲学从效用中得出的一些主要推论。我们两星期进行一次活动，读文章，并讨论与由此达成的前提一致的问题。如果不是一个细节，我打算给学会起名叫功利主义者学会这件事就根本不值一提。这是第一次有人用功利主义者这个名称，这个词就从这种不起眼的渠道进入了英语。它不是我发明的，我是从高尔特的一部小说《教区年鉴》中看到的，这本书假托一名苏格兰牧师的自传。在小说中，他警告自己教区的居民不要放弃福音，而要变成功利主义者。出于男孩子对名字和标语的喜好，我采纳了这个词，有几年，用它作为一个派别的称号来称呼自己和其他一些人。偶尔，持有这个词本来所指含义的一些人也会用它。随着那些观点吸引了更多注意力，这一术语被陌生人和反对者不断重复，就在倡导者放弃它和其他一些派系特征时，这个词反而应用得相当普遍了。这个所谓的学会最初仅有三名成员，其中一个是边沁先生的文书，为我们获得许可在边沁家里开会。我想人数从来没达到十个。学会于1826年解散，因此，它存在了大约三年半。对我来说，除了练习口头讨论这个好处之外，它对我的主要作用是让我接触到好几个当时水平不如我的年轻人，由于他们承认相同的观点，在他们中间，我有一段时间算是个领导者，对他们的智力进步产生了很大影响。任何我所遇见的、受过教育的年轻人，只要观点与学会不冲突，我都会尽力争取让他加入学会；还有一些人，要不是加入了学会的话，我可能永远都不会认识。那些变成我亲密朋友的会员——没有一个是任何意义上的信徒，而全都是基于各自知识基础而进行独立思考的思想家——包括威廉.艾顿.图克，他是一位著名政治经济学家的儿子，是位道德上和智力上都有非凡优点的年轻人，可惜英年早逝。他的朋友威廉.埃利斯，是政治经济学领域内一位有创造性的思想家，现在由于为教育进步做使徒般的努力而出名，受人尊敬；乔治.格雷厄姆，后来成了破产法庭的官方代理人，是位在几乎所有抽象主题上都有创意、有能力的思想家；还有一位（从1824年或1825年，他最初到英国学习法律开始），他在这个世界发出的声音比上述所有人都要多，他就是约翰·阿瑟·罗巴克。</td>
		<td class="en">It was in the winter of 1822—3 that I formed the plan of a little society, to be composed of young men agreeing in fundamental principles— acknowledging Utility as their standard in ethics and politics, and a certain number of the principal corollaries drawn from it in the philosophy I had accepted—and meeting once a fortnight to read essays and discuss questions conformably to the premises thus agreed on. The fact would hardly be worth mentioning, but for the circumstance, that the name I gave to the society I had planned was the Utilitarian Society. It was the first time that any one had taken the title of Utilitarian; and the term made its way into the language, from this humble source. I did not invent the word, but found it in one of Galt’s novels, the Annals of the Parish, in which the Scotch clergyman, of whom the book is a supposed autobiography, is represented as warning his parishioners not to leave the Gospel and become utilitarians. With a boy’s fondness for a name and a banner I seized on the word, and for some years called myself and others by it as a sectarian appellation; and it came to be occasionally used by some others holding the opinions which it was intended to designate. As those opinions attracted more notice, the term was repeated by strangers and opponents, and got into rather common use just about the time when those who had originally assumed it, laid down that along with other sectarian characteristics. The Society so called consisted at first of no more than three members, one of whom, being Mr. Bentham’s amanuensis, obtained for us permission to hold our meetings in his house. The number never, I think, reached ten, and the society was broken up in 1826. It had thus an existence of about three years and a half. The chief effect of it as regards myself, over and above the benefit of practice in oral discussion, was that of bringing me in contact with several young men at that time less advanced than myself, among whom, as they professed the same opinions, I was for some time a sort of leader, and had considerable influence on their mental progress. Any young man of education who fell in my way, and whose opinions were not incompatible with those of the Society, I endeavoured to press into its service; and some others I probably should never have known, had they not joined it. Those of the members who became my intimate companions—no one of whom was in any sense of the word a disciple, but all of them independent thinkers on their own basis —were William Eyton Tooke, son of the eminent political economist, a young man of singular worth both moral and intellectual, lost to the world by an early death; his friend William Ellis, an original thinker in the field of political economy, now honorably known by his apostolic exertions for the improvement of education; George Graham, afterwards an official assignee of the Bankruptcy Court, a thinker of originality and power on almost all abstract subjects; and (from the time when he came first to England to study for the bar in 1824 or 1825) a man who has made considerably more noise in the world than any of these, John Arthur Roebuck. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1823年5月，父亲为我在东印度公司印度通信检察署谋了一个职位，在他的直接领导之下，我接下来三十五年的职业生涯和地位都因此确定了。我以通常程序被录用，排在职员名单的最后面，升职要靠资历，至少在起初的时候是这样。但是我知道自己从一开始就要准备做起草公务急报的工作，这样可以得到充分的锻炼，以便接替当时这个办事处更重要部门的职员。有一段时间，我的草稿当然需要我的直接上司进行很多修正，但是，我很快就熟悉了业务。由于父亲的指导，加上自己能力的总体提升，没过几年，我就能胜任土邦某个主要部门里面与英属印度通信的总指挥的工作了，而且实际上就在做这个工作。被任命为检查官之前，这一直都是我的正式职务，就在我被任命为检查官两年后，东印度公司作为政治实体被废除，这决定了我必须退休。对于一个经济上不独立，又渴望把二十四小时的一部分时间用于个人智力追求的人来说，我不知道还有比这个谋生的工作更合适的选择了。对于一个有能力在文学或思想这些更高领域有所成就的人来说，为出版社写稿，不是可取的永久性办法，不仅因为这种谋生手段的不确定性，尤其是如果这个作家有良心，除了自己的观点之外，不会为了别人的观点而写作。还因为，让人能够赚钱谋生的那些作品本身没有生命力，也永远不是作者倾注全力的作品。一本书，如果注定能造就未来思想家，就必定要花很长时间来写，写完后，通常要过很长时间才能被人注意，并得到荣誉，因此无法作为赖以生存的手段。那些靠写作谋生的人必须依靠做文学苦力，最好写通俗作品。只能从必须花费的时间之外抽出一点时间用于追求自己的梦想，这点时间一般比公职容许的闲暇少，然而，却远远更让人头脑倦怠、疲劳。对我来说，整个一生中，我发现公职实际上是我同时进行其他脑力劳动的调剂。公职也需要一些智力，足以不让人觉得是讨厌的苦差事，而且，还不会给习惯于抽象思考，或者努力进行细心文学创作者的智力带来任何压力。然而，我也不是没有感觉到它的缺点，因为任何生活方式都有缺点。我不在乎失去某些职业有机会获得的财产和荣誉，尤其是律师工作，我已经说过，父亲曾为我考虑过这个职业。但是，我却无法不在乎被议会和公共生活排除在外，而且被限制在伦敦，会让我很明显地感觉到更直接的不快。东印度公司的惯例是每年允许的假期不超过一个月，然而，我很想过乡村生活，并且，在法国的逗留让我强烈渴望旅行。尽管不能毫无顾忌地沉迷于我的这些喜好，但它们也绝没有因为工作而全部被忽略掉。一年中的大部分星期天，我都是在乡下度过的，在乡间进行长时间散步。即使住在伦敦的时候，也是如此。在这每年一个月的假期中，有几年，我是在父亲乡下的房子里度过的。后来，一部分或整个假期都在旅行，主要是和一个或更多我选好的年轻同伴一起步行。再后来，在较远的旅行或远足中，我是自己一个人或者和其他朋友一起去的。法国、比利时和德国莱茵河由于离得近是每年假期都可能会去的地方。根据医生建议，我有了两个较长的假期，一次是三个月，另一次六个月，分别去了瑞士、蒂罗尔和意大利。幸运的是，这两次旅行都是在相当年轻的时候去的，让我大半生都有陶醉、有益的回忆。</td>
		<td class="en">In May, 1823, my professional occupation and status for the next thirty-five years of my life, were decided by my father’s obtaining for me an appointment from the East India Company, in the office of the Examiner of India Correspondence, immediately under himself. I was appointed in the usual manner, at the bottom of the list of clerks, to rise, at least in the first instance, by seniority; but with the understanding that I should be employed from the beginning in preparing drafts of despatches, and be thus trained up as a successor to those who then filled the higher departments of the office. My drafts of course required, for some time, much revision from my immediate superiors, but I soon became well acquainted with the business, and by my father’s instructions and the general growth of my own powers, I was in a few years qualified to be, and practically was, the chief conductor of the correspondence with India in one of the leading departments, that of the Native States. This continued to be my official duty until I was appointed Examiner, only two years before the time when the abolition of the East India Company as a political body determined my retirement. I do not know any one of the occupations by which a subsistence can now be gained, more suitable than such as this to any one who, not being in independent circumstances, desires to devote a part of the twenty-four hours to private intellectual pursuits. Writing for the press, cannot be recommended as a permanent resource to any one qualified to accomplish anything in the higher departments of literature or thought: not only on account of the uncertainty of this means of livelihood, especially if the writer has a conscience, and will not consent to serve any opinions except his own; but also because the writings by which one can live, are not the writings which themselves live, and are never those in which the writer does his best. Books destined to form future thinkers take too much time to write, and when written come, in general, too slowly into notice and repute, to be relied on for subsistence. Those who have to support themselves by their pen must depend on literary drudgery, or at best on writings addressed to the multitude; and can employ in the pursuits of their own choice, only such time as they can spare from those of necessity; which is generally less than the leisure allowed by office occupations, while the effect on the mind is far more enervating and fatiguing. For my own part I have, through life, found office duties an actual rest from the other mental occupations which I have carried on simultaneously with them. They were sufficiently intellectual not to be a distasteful drudgery, without being such as to cause any strain upon the mental powers of a person used to abstract thought, or to the labour of careful literary composition. The drawbacks, for every mode of life has its drawbacks, were not, however, unfelt by me. I cared little for the loss of the chances of riches and honours held out by some of the professions, particularly the bar, which had been, as I have already said, the profession thought of for me. But I was not indifferent to exclusion from Parliament, and public life: and I felt very sensibly the more immediate unpleasantness of confinement to London; the holiday allowed by India-House practice not exceeding a month in the year, while my taste was strong for a country life, and my sojourn in France had left behind it an ardent desire of travelling. But though these tastes could not be freely indulged, they were at no time entirely sacrificed. I passed most Sundays, throughout the year, in the country, taking long rural walks on that day even when residing in London. The month’s holiday was, for a few years, passed at my father’s house in the country: afterwards a part or the whole was spent in tours, chiefly pedestrian, with some one or more of the young men who were my chosen companions; and, at a later period, in longer journeys or excursions, alone or with other friends. France, Belgium, and Rhenish Germany were within easy reach of the annual holiday: and two longer absences, one of three, the other of six months, under medical advice, added Switzerland, the Tyrol, and, Italy to my list. Fortunately, also, both these journeys occurred rather early, so as to give the benefit and charm of the remembrance to a large portion of life. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I am disposed to agree with what has been surmised by others, that the opportunity which my official position gave me of learning by personal observation the necessary conditions of the practical conduct of public affairs, has been of considerable value to me as a theoretical reformer of the opinions and institutions of my time. Not, indeed, that public business transacted on paper, to take effect on the other side of the globe, was of itself calculated to give much practical knowledge of life. But the occupation accustomed me to see and hear the difficulties of every course, and the means of obviating them, stated and discussed deliberately, with a view to execution; it gave me opportunities of perceiving when public measures, and other political facts, did not produce the effects which had been expected of them, and from what causes; above all, it was valuable to me by making me, in this portion of my activity, merely one wheel in a machine, the whole of which had to work together. As a speculative writer, I should have had no one to consult but myself, and should have encountered in my speculations none of the obstacles which would have started up whenever they came to be applied to practice. But as a Secretary conducting political correspondence, I could not issue an order or express an opinion, without satisfying various persons very unlike myself, that the thing was fit to be done. I was thus in a good position for finding out by practice the mode of putting a thought which gives it easiest admittance into minds not prepared for it by habit; while I became practically conversant with the difficulties of moving bodies of men, the necessities of compromise, the art of sacrificing the non-essential to preserve the essential. I learnt how to obtain the best I could, when I could not obtain everything; instead of being indignant or dispirited because I could not have entirely my own way, to be pleased and encouraged when I could have the smallest part of it; and when even that could not be, to bear with complete equanimity the being overruled altogether. I have found, through life, these acquisitions to be of the greatest possible importance for personal happiness, and they are also a very necessary condition for enabling any one, either as theorist or as practical man, to effect the greatest amount of good compatible with his opportunities.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >办公室工作占据了我非常多的时间，但是我并没有放松自己的追求，我比以往任何时候都更精力旺盛地坚持着。大约从这个时候起，我开始为报纸撰稿。我发表的第一个作品，是1822年底在《旅行者》晚报上刊登的两封信。《旅行者》（后来收购合并了《环球》，成为《环球旅行者》）当时属于著名的政治经济学家托伦斯上校。凭借能干的编辑沃尔特.库尔森先生（他曾是边沁先生的抄写员，后来成了记者，然后做编辑，接着做承办转让事务的律师，去世时是英国内政部的法律顾问），该报成了自由主义政治最重要的机关报之一。托伦斯上校亲自为自己的报纸写了很多政治经济学的文章。这时，他写了一篇文章，攻击李嘉图和我父亲的一些观点，在父亲的鼓动下，我试着写了一篇回应文章，库尔森出于对父亲的考虑，以及对我的好意，把它插到了报纸里面。托伦斯写了一篇文章回应，我也再次反驳。之后不久，我尝试写更具挑战性的东西。理查德.卡莱尔和他的妻子以及姐姐，由于发表敌视基督教的文章而招致起诉，在当时引起了很大的关注，我经常拜访的人对此尤为关注。讨论的自由在当时，不用说宗教上的，即便是政治上的，也和目前至少看起来是被理论上认可接受的界点相距甚远。持有让人讨厌的观点的人为了能自由表达，总是得做好多次辩论的准备。我用威克利夫的笔名写了五封系列书信，全面阐述了自由发表一切宗教观点的问题，投给了《纪事晨报》。其中三封在1823年的1月和2月发表，另外两封，由于内容对这个杂志来说太直率，一直没有发表。但是不久后，我写了一篇同一主题的文章，是关于下议院一次辩论的话题，作为社论刊登了出来。1823年一整年中，我的很多投稿都发表在《纪事晨报》和《旅行者》上，有的是书评，但更多的是书信，评论议会里面说的一些胡话、法律的缺陷以及地方行政官员或法庭做的坏事。在揭露腐败方面，《纪事晨报》当时做得相当出色。佩里先生去世后，报纸的编辑和管理职务移交给了约翰.布莱克先生，从发刊以来他就是该报的记者。他博览群书，阅历广泛，诚恳而思想纯朴。他是我父亲一位很特别的朋友，很多观点受到父亲和边沁的影响，他在自己的文章里重现这些观点和其他有价值的思想，表达得非常流利，技巧娴熟。从这时起，《纪事晨报》不再像以前那样仅仅是辉格党的机关报。在接下来的十年里，它在很大程度上成为功利主义激进分子表达观点的工具。这主要在于布莱克的文章，得到了方布兰克的协助，后者在《纪事晨报》上面发表的文章和妙语初次展现了一个作家的杰出素质。法律和司法管理方面的缺陷，是这家报纸主要致力于改善的。在那以前，除了边沁和我父亲，几乎没有任何人批评过英国公共机构和它们管理中的最大弊端。英国人几乎普遍相信，英国法律、英国司法以及英国不取报酬的地方行政官员，都是优秀的典型。我这么说一点都不过分，除了提供主要资料的边沁，这种可鄙迷信的破除便最应归功于作为《纪事晨报》编辑的布莱克了。他不计报酬地不断向这种迷信开火，暴露法律和法庭的荒谬与缺陷，直至人们感觉到这些为止。在很多问题上，他都成为舆论的喉舌，所发表的意见经常比其他报纸提倡的早很多。布莱克先生经常拜访我父亲，格罗特先生常说，他总能从周一早上的文章中得知布莱克周日是否和我父亲在一起。布莱克是父亲通过交谈和个人影响使其见解为世人所知的众多渠道中最重要的一个。加之其作品的影响，他成了这个国家的一股力量，这对于平民身份的个人来说，仅仅通过智力和品格的力量是很难做到的。这股力量经常在最难以觉察和最不受怀疑的地方，最有效率地发挥作用。我已经注意到，李嘉图、休谟和格罗特所做的事情，一部分是他激励和说服的结果。他简直是布鲁厄姆身边为公众谋福利的天才，不管是从教育、法律改革，还是其他方面都可以看出来。他的影响就像难以数计的溪流。这种影响现在马上要大大扩展了，因为《威斯敏斯特评论》创刊了。</td>
		<td class="en">The occupation of so much of my time by office work did not relax my attention to my own pursuits, which were never carried on more vigorously. It was about this time that I began to write in newspapers. The first writings of mine which got into print were two letters published towards the end of 1822, in the Traveller evening newspaper. The Traveller (which afterwards grew into the Globe and Traveller by the purchase and incorporation of the Globe) was then the property of the well known political economist Colonel Torrens. Under the editorship of an able man, Mr. Walter Coulson (who, after being an amanuensis of Mr. Bentham, became a reporter, then an editor, next a barrister and conveyancer, and died Counsel to the Home Office), it had become one of the most important newspaper organs of Liberal politics. Col. Torrens himself wrote much of the political economy of his paper; and had at this time made an attack upon some opinion of Ricardo and my father, to which, at my father’s instigation, I attempted an answer, and Coulson out of consideration for my father and goodwill to me, inserted it. There was a reply by Torrens, to which I again rejoined. I soon after attempted something considerably more ambitious. The prosecutions of Richard Carlile and his wife and sister for publications hostile to Christianity, were then exciting much attention, and nowhere more than among the people I frequented. Freedom of discussion even in politics, much more in religion, was at that time far from being, even in theory, the conceded point which it at least seems to be now; and the holders of obnoxious opinions had to be always ready to argue and re-argue for the liberty of expressing them. I wrote a series of five letters, under the signature of Wickliffe, going over the whole length and breadth of the question of free publication of all opinions on religion, and offered them to the Morning Chronicle. Three of them were published in January and February, 1823; the other two, containing things too outspoken for that journal, never appeared at all. But a paper which I wrote soon after on the same subject, à propos of a debate in the House of Commons, was inserted as a leading article; and during the whole of this year, 1823, a considerable number of my contributions were printed in the Chronicle and Traveller: sometimes notices of books, but oftener letters, commenting on some nonsense talked in Parliament, or some defect of the law, or misdoings of the magistracy or the courts of justice. In this last department the Chronicle was now rendering signal service. After the death of Mr. Perry, the editorship and management of the paper had devolved on Mr. John Black, long a reporter on its establishment; a man of most extensive reading and information, great honesty and simplicity of mind; a particular friend of my father, imbued with many of his and Bentham’s ideas, which he reproduced in his articles, among other valuable thoughts, with great facility and skill. From this time the Chronicle ceased to be the merely Whig organ it was before, and during the next ten years became to a considerable extent a vehicle of the opinions of the Utilitarian Radicals. This was mainly by what Black himself wrote, with some assistance from Fonblanque, who first shewed his eminent qualities as a writer by articles and jeux d’esprit in the Chronicle. The defects of the law, and of the administration of justice, were the subject on which that paper rendered most service to improvement. Up to that time hardly a word had been said, except by Bentham and my father, against that most peccant part of English institutions and of their administration. It was the almost universal creed of Englishmen, that the law of England, the judicature of England, the unpaid magistracy of England, were models of excellence. I do not go beyond the mark in saying, that after Bentham, who supplied the principal materials, the greatest share of the merit of breaking down this wretched superstition belongs to Black, as editor of the Morning Chronicle. He kept up an incessant fire against it, exposing the absurdities and vices of the law and the courts of justice, paid and unpaid, until he forced some sense of them into people’s minds. On many other questions he became the organ of opinions much in advance of any which had ever before found regular advocacy in the newspaper press. Black was a frequent visitor of my father, and Mr. Grote used to say that he always knew by the Monday morning’s article, whether Black had been with my father on the Sunday. Black was one of the most influential of the many channels through which my father’s conversation and personal influence made his opinions tell on the world; co-operating with the effect of his writings in making him a power in the country, such as it has rarely been the lot of an individual in a private station to be, through the mere force of intellect and character: and a power which was often acting the most efficiently where it was least seen and suspected. I have already noticed how much of what was done by Ricardo, Hume, and Grote, was the result, in part, of his prompting and persuasion. He was the good genius by the side of Brougham in most of what he did for the public, either on education, law reform, or any other subject. And his influence flowed in minor streams too numerous to be specified. This influence was now about to receive a great extension by the foundation of the Westminster Review. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >与大家可能会预想的相反，我父亲完全没有参与创立《威斯敏斯特评论》。很多年前，他和边沁先生就谈论过，予以《爱丁堡评论》和《季刊评论》迎头痛击需要一份激进主义的报纸（当时，这两份报纸正处于名声和影响最大的时候），父亲做编辑也在计划之中，但这个想法从未付诸实施。然而，1823年，边沁先生决定自己出资创立这个评论杂志，让我父亲做编辑，但父亲拒绝了，因为这与他在东印度公司的职位相冲突。于是评论杂志就委托给了鲍林先生（现在的约翰爵士），当时他是伦敦的一名商人。鲍林先生在这之前的两三年，经常拜访边沁先生，他有许多优秀品质，非常仰慕边沁，热情地采纳边沁的大部分观点，尽管不是全部，并与所有国家的自由主义者有着广泛的认识和联系。所有这些都使边沁对他十分欣赏，似乎也让他有资格成为一名有力的代理人，向世界各地传播边沁的名声和学说。父亲虽没怎么见过鲍林，但是对他的了解足以形成深刻的印象，他与父亲心目中适合管理政治和哲学评论杂志的人是完全不同的类型。并且，他认为这项事业前景坏到令他为整件事情惋惜，不仅觉得边沁先生肯定会损失金钱，而且还可能会损害激进主义原则的名誉。然而，他又不能置边沁先生于不顾，他答应给创刊号写一篇文章。作为之前讨论的方案里备受喜爱的一部分，这部分内容应该是用来回顾和评论其他评论报纸的。于是父亲的这篇文章就是对《爱丁堡评论》自创刊以来的一个总体批评。在写这篇文章之前，父亲让我读了每一期的《爱丁堡评论》，或者每一本里面看起来比较重要的文章（这项工作在1823年时不像现在这么艰巨），并让我把我认为他会愿意研究的文章，根据其好坏，给他作注释。父亲的文章是《威斯敏斯特评论》一面世即引起轰动的最主要原因，而且，不论在构思上还是在写作手法上，都是其佳作之一。他首先分析了期刊文学的总体趋势，指出它不能像书籍一样等待成功到来，而必须立刻成功，要么就永远无法成功，因此几乎可以肯定，期刊会针对其受众公开宣称并反复灌输他们已经持有的观点，而不是试图矫正或改进那些观点。接下来，为了刻画《爱丁堡评论》作为政治喉舌的立场，他用激进主义的观点对《英国宪法》进行了全面分析。他进一步指出宪法彻头彻尾的贵族政治特征：几百个家庭就决定了下议院大多数人的任命；把更加独立的一部分人——郡议员——完全等同于大土地所有者；为了方便，这个狭隘的寡头统治国家让不同阶层分享一部分权力；最后提到的是教会和律师业，他把它们称作宪法的两个靠山。他指出，这种结构的贵族团体的自然趋势是把自己分成两党，一党掌控政府，另一党竭力在公共舆论的帮助下，取代前者，占据支配地位，而贵族的统治不会有任何实质上的牺牲。他描绘了在野的贵族党可能会采取的做法，以及他们会持有的政治立场，即为了得到大众支持而卖弄流行的原则。他展示了这种理念是如何在辉格党及其文化喉舌《爱丁堡评论》的行为中体现的。父亲描述了他们的主要特征，即他所谓的“跷跷板”现象：轮流写双方每个触及统治阶级权力或利益的问题；有时在不同的文章里面写，有时在同一篇文章的不同地方写。父亲还举出了丰富的例子来表明他的立场。对辉格党和它的政策，以前从未有过这么有力的攻击。在这个国家，也从未有人为了激进主义做出如此强烈的一击。我相信，除了父亲外，也没有任何人能写出那样的文章。</td>
		<td class="en">Contrary to what may have been supposed, my father was in no degree a party to setting up the Westminster Review. The need of a Radical organ to make head against the Edinburgh and Quarterly (then in the period of their greatest reputation and influence), had been a topic of conversation between him and Mr. Bentham many years earlier, and it had been a part of their cháteau en Espagne that my father should be the editor; but the idea had never assumed any practical shape. In 1823, however, Mr. Bentham determined to establish the Review at his own cost, and offered the editorship to my father, who declined it as incompatible with his India House appointment. It was then entrusted to Mr. (now Sir John) Bowring, at that time a merchant in the City. Mr. Bowring had been for two or three years previous an assiduous frequenter of Mr. Bentham, to whom he was recommended by many personal good qualities, by an ardent admiration for Bentham, a zealous adoption of many, though not all of his opinions, and, not least, by an extensive acquaintanceship and correspondence with Liberals of all countries, which seemed to qualify him for being a powerful agent in spreading Bentham’s fame and doctrines through all quarters of the world. My father had seen little of Bowring, but knew enough of him to have formed a strong opinion, that he was a man of an entirely different type from what my father considered suitable for conducting a political and philosophical Review: and he augured so ill of the enterprise that he regretted it altogether, feeling persuaded not only that Mr. Bentham would lose his money, but that discredit would probably be brought upon Radical principles. He could not however desert Mr. Bentham, and he consented to write an article for the first number. As it had been a favorite portion of the scheme formerly talked of, that part of the work should be devoted to reviewing the other Reviews, this article of my father’s was to be a general criticism of the Edinburgh Review from its commencement. Before writing it he made me read through all the volumes of the Review, or as much of each as seemed of any importance (which was not so arduous a task in 1823 as it would be now), and make notes for him of the articles which I thought he would wish to examine, either on account of their good or their bad qualities. This paper of my father’s was the chief cause of the sensation which the Westminster Review produced at its first appearance, and is, both in conception and in execution, one of the most striking of all his writings. He began by an analysis of the tendencies of periodical literature in general; pointing out, that it cannot, like books, wait for success, but must succeed immediately, or not at all, and is hence almost certain to profess and inculcate the opinions already held by the public to which it addresses itself, instead of attempting to rectify or improve those opinions. He next, to characterize the position of the Edinburgh Review as a political organ, entered into a complete analysis, from the Radical point of view, of the British Constitution. He held up to notice its thoroughly aristocratic character: the nomination of a majority of the House of Commons by a few hundred families; the entire identification of the more independent portion, the county members, with the great landholders; the different classes whom this narrow oligarchy was induced, for convenience, to admit to a share of power; and finally, what he called its two props, the Church, and the legal profession. He pointed out the natural tendency of an aristocratic body of this composition, to group itself into two parties, one of them in possession of the executive, the other endeavouring to supplant the former and become the predominant section by the aid of public opinion, without any essential sacrifice of the aristocratical predominance. He described the course likely to be pursued, and the political ground occupied, by an aristocratic party in opposition, coquetting with popular principles for the sake of popular support. He shewed how this idea was realized in the conduct of the Whig party, and of the Edinburgh Review as its chief literary organ. He described, as their main characteristic, what he termed “seesaw;” writing alternately on both sides of every question which touched the power or interest of the governing classes; sometimes in different articles, sometimes in different parts of the same article: and illustrated his position by copious specimens. So formidable an attack on the Whig party and policy had never before been made; nor had so great a blow been ever struck, in this country, for Radicalism; nor was there, I believe, any living person capable of writing that article, except my father. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the meantime the nascent review had formed a junction with another project, of a purely literary periodical, to be edited by Mr. Henry Southern, afterwards a diplomatist, then a literary man by profession. The two editors agreed to unite their corps, and divide the editorship, Bowring taking the political, Southern the literary department. Southern’s review was to have been published by Longman, and that firm, though part proprietors of the Edinburgh, were willing to be the publishers of the new journal. But when all the arrangements had been made, and the prospectuses sent out, the Longmans saw my father’s attack on the Edinburgh, and drew back. My father was now appealed to for his interest with his own publisher, Baldwin, which was exerted with a successful result. And so, in April 1824, amidst anything but hope on my father’s part, and that of most of those who afterwards aided in carrying on the Review, the first number made its appearance. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那一期对我们大多数人来说是个惊喜。文章的平均水平比预期要高很多。文学和艺术部分主要靠宾厄姆先生，他是个律师（后来是警备司法官），有几年是边沁的常客，是奥斯丁兄弟俩的朋友，以很大的热情采纳了边沁先生的哲学观点。部分出于巧合，第一期里面宾厄姆的文章竟然有五篇之多，我们非常喜欢这些文章。我清楚地记得自己对《威斯敏斯特评论》的复杂感情。我们意外地发现它足以成为那些秉持期刊公开宣扬的观点的人可信赖喉舌时的快乐。还有极度的苦恼，因为大体上来说，连以前我们认为会是瑕疵的地方，它都做得很好。然而，除了我们普遍赞成它之外，我们还得知期刊的销售数量对于首期来说非常之大，并且发现这一和其他具有一定基础的党派喉舌报刊意图相同的激进主义评论杂志的出现引起了很多关注。此时我们不再犹豫，都变得很热切，想竭尽全力去巩固它，改善它。</td>
		<td class="en">That number was an agreeable surprise to most of us. The average of the articles was of much better quality than had been expected. The literary and artistic department had rested chiefly on Mr. Bingham, a barrister (subsequently a police magistrate), who had been for some years a frequenter of Bentham, was a friend of both the Austins, and had adopted with great ardour Mr. Bentham’s philosophical opinions. Partly from accident, there were in the first number as many as five articles by Bingham; and we were extremely pleased with them. I well remember the mixed feeling I myself had about the Review; the joy at finding, what we did not at all expect, that it was sufficiently good to be capable of being made a creditable organ of those who held the opinions it professed; and extreme vexation, since it was so good on the whole, at what we thought the blemishes of it. When, however, in addition to our generally favourable opinion of it, we learned that it had an extraordinarily large sale for a first number, and found that the appearance of a Radical Review, with pretensions equal to those of the established organs of parties, had excited much attention, there could be no room for hesitation, and we all became eager in doing everything we could to strengthen and improve it. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">My father continued to write occasional articles. The Quarterly Review received its exposure, as a sequel to that of the Edinburgh. Of his other contributions, the most important were an attack on Southey’s Book of the Church, in the fifth number, and a political article in the twelfth. Mr. Austin only contributed one paper, but one of great merit, an argument against primogeniture, in reply to an article then lately published in the Edinburgh Review by McCulloch. Grote also was a contributor only once; all the time he could spare being already taken up with his History of Greece. The article he wrote was on his own subject, and was a very complete exposure and castigation of Mitford. Bingham and Charles Austin continued to write for some time; Fonblanque was a frequent contributor from the third number. Of my particular associates, Ellis was a regular writer up to the ninth number; and about the time when he left off, others of the set began; Eyton Tooke, Graham, and Roebuck. I was myself the most frequent writer of all, having contributed, from the second number to the eighteenth, thirteen articles; reviews of books on history and political economy, or discussions on special political topics, as corn laws, game laws, law of libel. Occasional articles of merit came in from other acquaintances of my father’s, and in time, of mine; and some of Mr. Bowring’s writers turned out well. On the whole, however, the conduct of the Review was never satisfactory to any of the persons strongly interested in its principles, with whom I came in contact. Hardly ever did a number come out without containing several things extremely offensive to us, either in point of opinion, of taste, or by mere want of ability. The unfavorable judgments passed by my father, Grote, the two Austins, and others, were re-echoed with exaggeration by us younger people; and as our youthful zeal rendered us by no means backward in making complaints, we led the two editors a sad life. From my knowledge of what I then was, I have no doubt that we were at least as often wrong as right; and I am very certain that if the Review had been carried on according to our notions (I mean those of the juniors), it would have been no better, perhaps not even so good as it was. But it is worth noting as a fact in the history of Benthamism, that the periodical organ, by which it was best known, was from the first extremely unsatisfactory to those, whose opinions on all subjects it was supposed specially to represent. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而与此同时，《威斯敏斯特评论》在世界上发出了不小的声音，在舆论界给功利主义式的激进主义以公认的地位，这地位和它追随者的数量及当时大部分能被算在追随者之内的人的优点和能力是不相称的。众所周知，那是个自由主义迅速崛起的时代。由于与法国的战争而带来的恐惧和仇恨已经消散，人们开始再次审视国内政治，潮流开始倾向于改革。欧洲大陆重新受到旧的统治家族的压迫，英国政府对被称作神圣同盟的反自由主义阴谋集团的明确支持，加上长时间损失惨重的战争导致的巨大国债和税收负担，让政府和议会很不得人心。在柏代特和科贝特的领导下，激进主义获得的声誉和地位让政府很惊恐，他们的惊恐几乎没有因为著名的《六项法案》而暂时减轻，因为对卡罗琳王后的审判激起了人们更广泛、更深刻的仇恨之情。尽管这种仇恨的外部迹象随着它激动人心的运动一起消散了，但是到处都萌生了一种前所未有的反对滥用各种职权的精神。休谟先生不屈不挠地审查公共开支，迫使下议院划分财政收支概算的每一个引起异议的项目，他的行动已经对公众舆论产生了强有力的影响，迫使不情愿的政府缩减了很多不重要的开支。1820年，由图克先生草拟，亚历山大.巴林提呈的《伦敦商人贸易自由请愿119书》，和李嘉图在数年议会生涯中的不懈努力，使政治经济学在公共事务中大显身手。李嘉图受金价论战的推动而做的著述，加上随后我父亲和麦卡洛克相继的阐述和评论（那几年，他在《爱丁堡评论》上的作品很有价值），引起了人们对政治经济学的普遍关注，至少让内阁的一部分人相信了它。哈斯基逊在坎宁的支持下，开始逐渐摧毁保护体系。他们的一个同事实际上在1846年就完成了这件事情，尽管最后的残余要到1860年才被格莱斯顿先生扫清。皮尔先生，当时的内政大臣，谨慎地走上前无古人的功利主义法律改革道路。在这一时期，自由主义似乎将要成为时代的主旋律，最高层鼓吹要改进制度，最底层则强烈要求全面变革议会的章程。这时一批看似属于新兴学派的作家一般都会在争论中出现，他们要求成为这个新趋势的立法者和理论家，由此引起人们的关注也不足为奇。他们写作时带着坚定的信念，而好像很少有人对一个同样明确的信条有同样强烈的信心；他们用大胆的文字正面抨击现有的两个政党；他们毫不妥协地宣称反对很多为人们普遍接受的观点，并由于认为他人比他们宣称的更异端而饱受怀疑；还有至少从我父亲的文章中体现出来的才能和气魄，以及他身后足以支撑一家评论杂志的团体。最后，这家评论杂志拥有读者的事实——所有这一切，让哲学和政治领域的功利主义学派，在公众的心中占据了前所未有的重要位置，或者说在其他同样急切的思想学派在英国兴起后以来再次获得了重要的地位。由于我处在其核心位置，了解其构成，作为少数最活跃的分子之一极大地参与了它的事务，我这么说可能没什么不合适，即与其他大部分人相比，描述一下它的情况是我的分内之事。</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile, however, the Review made considerable noise in the world, and gave a recognised status, in the arena of opinion and discussion, to the Benthamic type of radicalism, out of all proportion to the number of its adherents, and to the personal merits and abilities, at that time, of most of those who could be reckoned among them. It was a time, as is known, of rapidly rising Liberalism. When the fears and animosities accompanying the war with France had been brought to an end, and people had once more a place in their thoughts for home politics, the tide began to set towards reform. The renewed oppression of the Continent by the old reigning families, the countenance apparently given by the English Government to the conspiracy against liberty called the Holy Alliance, and the enormous weight of the national debt and taxation occasioned by so long and costly a war, rendered the government and parliament very unpopular. Radicalism, under the leadership of the Burdett and Cobbett1, had assumed a character and importance which seriously alarmed the Administration: and their alarm had scarcely been temporarily assuaged by the celebrated Six Acts2, when the trial of Queen Caroline roused a still wider and deeper feeling of hatred. Though the outward signs of this hatred passed away with its exciting cause, there arose on all sides a spirit which had never shewn itself before, of opposition to abuses in detail. Mr. Hume’s persevering scrutiny of the public expenditure, forcing the House of Commons to a division on every objectionable item in the estimates, had begun to tell with great force on public opinion, and had extorted many minor retrenchments from an unwilling Administration. Political economy had asserted itself with great vigour in public affairs, by the petition of the merchants of London for free trade, drawn up in 1820 by Mr. Tooke and presented by Mr. Alexander Baring3; and by the noble exertions of Ricardo during the few years of his parliamentary life. His writings, following up the impulse given by the Bullion controversy, and followed up in their turn by the expositions and comments of my father and McCulloch (whose writings in the Edinburgh Review during those years were most valuable), had drawn general attention to the subject, making at least partial converts in the Cabinet itself; and Huskisson, supported by Canning4, had commenced that gradual demolition of the protective system, which one of their colleagues virtually completed in 1846, though the last vestiges were only swept away by Mr. Gladstone5 in 1860. Mr. Peel, then Home Secretary, was entering cautiously into the untrodden and peculiarly Benthamic path of Law Reform. At this period, when Liberalism seemed to be becoming the tone of the time, when improvement of institutions was preached from the highest places, and a complete change of the constitution of Parliament was loudly demanded in the lowest, it is not strange that attention should have been roused by the regular appearance in controversy of what seemed a new school of writers, claiming to be the legislators and theorists of this new tendency. The air of strong conviction with which they wrote, when scarcely any one else seemed to have an equally strong faith in as definite a creed; the boldness with which they tilted against the very front of both the existing political parties; their uncompromising profession of opposition to many of the generally received opinions, and the suspicion they lay under of holding others still more heterodox than they professed; the talent and verve of at least my father’s articles, and the appearance of a corps behind him sufficient to carry on a Review; and finally, the fact that the Review was bought and read, made the so-called Bentham school in philosophy and politics fill a greater place in the public mind than it had held before, or has ever again held since other equally earnest schools of thought have arisen in England. As I was in the head quarters of it, knew of what it was composed, and as one of the most active of its very small number, might say without undue assumption, quorum pars magna fui, it belongs to me more than to most others to give some account of it. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">This supposed school, then, had no other existence than what was constituted by the fact, that my father’s writings and conversation drew round him a certain number of young men who had already imbibed, or who imbibed from him, a greater or smaller portion of his very decided political and philosophical opinions. The notion that Bentham was surrounded by a band of disciples who received their opinions from his lips, is a fable to which my father did justice in his “Fragment on Mackintosh,” and which, to all who knew Mr. Bentham’s habits of life and manner of conversation, is simply ridiculous. The influence which Bentham exercised was by his writings. Through them he has produced, and is producing, effects on the condition of mankind, wider and deeper, no doubt, than any which can be attributed to my father. He is a much greater name in history. But my father exercised a far greater personal ascendancy. He was sought for the vigour and instructiveness of his conversation, and did use it largely as an instrument for the diffusion of his opinions. I have never known any man who could do such ample justice to his best thoughts in colloquial discussion. His perfect command over his great mental resources, the terseness and expressiveness of his language and the moral earnestness as well as intellectual force of his delivery, made him one of the most striking of all argumentative conversers: and he was full of anecdote, a hearty laugher, and, when with people whom he liked, a most lively and amusing companion. It was not solely, or even chiefly, in diffusing his merely intellectual convictions that his power shewed itself: it was still more through the influence of a quality, of which I have only since learnt to appreciate the extreme rarity: that exalted public spirit and regard above all things to the good of the whole, which warmed into life and activity every germ of similar virtue that existed in the minds he came in contact with: the desire he made them feel for his approbation, the shame at his disapproval; the moral support which his conversation and his very existence gave to those who were aiming at the same objects, and the encouragement he afforded to the fainthearted or desponding among them, by the firm confidence which (though the reverse of sanguine as to the results to be expected in any one particular case) he always felt in the power of reason, the general progress of improvement, and the good which individuals could do by judicious effort. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >是父亲的见解让当时的边沁主义或功利主义的宣传有了不同于一般的特点。这些见解从他那里向不同方向零散地传播开来，这种源源不断的传播主要有三条渠道。一个是通过我，我的思想是唯一一个直接由他指导塑造而成的，他通过我对很多年轻人产生了重大影响，这些人继而成了宣传员。第二个是通过查尔斯.奥斯丁的剑桥同辈，他们或者是受到他的启蒙，或者受到他主要精神的推动，采纳了很多跟我父亲类似的观点，其中一些更重要的人后来寻求与父亲结识的机会，经常去拜访他。这些人中值得一提的是斯特拉特（后来成为贝尔珀勋爵），和现在的罗米利勋爵，我父亲和他德高望重的父亲塞缪尔爵士，早就是好朋友的关系。第三个渠道是剑桥更年轻一代的在校大学生，他们与奥斯丁不是同辈，和艾顿.图克是同辈。由于观点相近，他们被吸引到可敬的图克身边，然后由他引荐给我父亲。这些人中最突出的是查尔斯.布勒。其他人个别地接受、传播了不少父亲的影响，比如，布莱克（之前提到过）和方布兰克。然而，我们都认为这些人中的大多数都不是彻底的同盟，比如方布兰克总是在很多重要的地方与我们有分歧。但实际上，我们当中任何一部分人都决不会完全一致，也没有任何人毫无保留地接受父亲的所有观点。例如，尽管可能我们都认为他的《论政府》是部充满政治智慧的杰作，但是我们绝对并非赞同它的每个段落，在文章里他主张不给予妇女选举权，说这与善政并不矛盾，因为她们的利益和男人是相同的。对于这种说法，我和我所有的同仁们都断然反对。客观地说，父亲说过他否认自己有意断言妇女应该被排除在选举权之外，四十岁以下的男子其实也应被排除，对这部分人他在下一段里就提出了完全类似的论点。正如他所说的，他并非在讨论选举权是否最好受到限制，而仅仅（假设它受限制的话）在讨论：在不必牺牲善政保障措施的前提下，限制的最大限度。但是那时我认为，之后我也一直都这么认为，他承认的观点和他否认的观点以及论文要反对的任何观点一样，是个很大的错误。妇女的利益包含在男子的利益里面恰恰像臣民的利益包含在国王的利益里面一样，任何人人享有选举权的现有理由都要求妇女不应被剥夺选举权，这也是年轻皈依者们的一般观点。令人欣慰的是，边沁先生在这个重要问题上完全站在我们这一边。</td>
		<td class="en">It was my father’s opinions which gave the distinguishing character to the Benthamic or utilitarian propagandism of that time. They fell singly scattered from him in many directions, but they f lowed from him in a continued stream principally in three channels. One was through me, the only mind directly formed by his instructions, and through whom considerable influence was exercised over various young men, who became, in their turn, propagandists. A second was through some of the Cambridge cotemporaries of Charles Austin, who, either initiated by him or under the general mental impulse which he gave, had adopted many opinions allied to those of my father, and some of the more considerable of whom afterwards sought my father’s acquaintance and frequented his house. Among these may be mentioned Strutt, afterwards Lord Belper, and the present Lord Romilly, with whose eminent father, Sir Samuel, my father had of old been on terms of friendship. The third channel was that of a younger generation of Cambridge undergraduates, cotemporary, not with Austin, but with Eyton Tooke, who were drawn to that estimable person by affinity of opinions, and introduced by him to my father: the most notable of these was Charles Buller. Various other persons individually received and transmitted a considerable amount of my father’s influence: for example, Black (as before mentioned) and Fonblanque: most of these however we accounted only partial allies; Fonblanque, for instance, was always divergent from us on many important points. But indeed there was by no means complete unanimity among any portion of us, nor had any of us adopted implicitly all my father’s opinions. For example, although his Essay on Government was regarded probably by all of us as a masterpiece of political wisdom, our adhesion by no means extended to the paragraph of it, in which he maintains that women may consistently with good government, be excluded from the suffrage, because their interest is the same with that of men. From this doctrine, I, and all those who formed my chosen associates, most positively dissented. It is due to my father to say that he denied having intended to affirm that women should be excluded, any more than men under the age of forty, concerning whom he maintained, in the very next paragraph, an exactly similar thesis. He was, as he truly said, not discussing whether the suffrage had better be restricted, but only (assuming that it is to be restricted) what is the utmost limit of restriction, which does not necessarily involve a sacrifice of the securities for good government. But I thought then, as I have always thought since, that the opinion which he acknowledged, no less than that which he disclaimed, is as great an error as any of those against which the Essay was directed; that the interest of women is included in that of men exactly as much and no more, as the interest of subjects is included in that of kings; and that every reason which exists for giving the suffrage to anybody, demands that it should not be withheld from women. This was also the general opinion of the younger proselytes; and it is pleasant to be able to say that Mr. Bentham, on this important point, was wholly on our side.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But though none of us, probably, agreed in every respect with my father, his opinions, as I said before, were the principal element which gave its colour and character to the little group of young men who were the first propagators of what was afterwards called “Philosophic Radicalism.” Their mode of thinking was not characterized by Benthamism in any sense which has relation to Bentham as a chief or guide, but rather by a combination of Bentham’s point of view with that of the modern political economy, and with the Hartleian metaphysics. Malthus’s population principle was quite as much a banner, and point of union among us, as any opinion specially belonging to Bentham. This great doctrine, originally brought forward as an argument against the indefinite improvability of human affairs, we took up with ardent zeal in the contrary sense, as indicating the sole means of realizing that improvability by securing full employment at high wages to the whole labouring population through a voluntary restriction of the increase of their numbers. The other leading characteristics of the creed, which we held in common with my father, may be stated as follows: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在政治上，人们几乎无限制地相信两件事情的功效：代表制的政府和完全的言论自由。父亲完全相信理智对人类思维的影响——只要能够影响到的话——他的信念是如此之深，以致于他觉得，如果能教全民读书，允许把所有观点以口头或书面形式呈现给他们，而他们能依靠选举权任命执行他们观点的立法机关的话，一切都能实现。他认为，当立法机关不再只代表某个阶级的利益之时，它就会真诚地、十分明智地为整体的利益服务。因为人们将在受过教育的才智的充分指导下，选择一般说来合适的人来代表他们，并在此后赋予选出来的人以自由的决断力。相应地，贵族的统治，即不管是什么形式的少数人的政府，在他眼里都是阻碍人类用他们当中最卓越的贤才来管理自己事务的唯一障碍，是他严厉指责的对象。民主的选举权是他政治信条的主要内容，不是把一直到那时候都用来支持民主政治的自由、人权或任何有着类似的意义更大或更小的话语作为理由，而是把民主的选举权当作最重要的“善政保障设施”。在这一点上，他还是只坚持他所认为的要点。相比之下，他比边沁还要不关心君主或共和政体的形式——在边沁眼里，国王扮演的是“腐败将军”，看起来肯定很可憎。除了贵族统治，英国国教或牧师组织也是他憎恶的对象，因为它们的地位决定了它们是让宗教堕落的重要因素，还乐于反对人类进步。尽管他私底下并不讨厌不应承担过错的牧师本人，甚至还和好几个结下了诚挚的友谊。在道德规范上，对于他认为的对人类福利比较重要的所有要点，他的道德情感都很积极坚定，然而他对普通道德观的所有教条一点也不关心（尽管他的漠不关心没有在行为中表现出来），他认为这些教条除了根植于禁欲主义和教士权术外，没有什么根据。比如，他期盼两性之间的自由度能有较大提高，但是没有装模作样地要去界定这种自由的具体情形是什么样子，或者应该是什么样子。这种观点在他那里，不管是理论上还是实践上都不是和纵欲联系在一起的。相反，他期望自由度提升后的益处之一，就是人们的想象不再仅仅关注肉体关系及其附加物，不再把它扩大为人生的主要目标之一。他认为，这种想象和情感的堕落是人类头脑中最根深蒂固、最普遍的罪恶。在心理学方面，他的主要信条是所有人类性格都是由环境决定的，通过普遍联系的原则，以及随之而来的、用教育提升人的道德水准和智力状况的无限可能性。这是他所有学说中最重要的，或者最需要坚持的。不幸的是它也是和当时及以后的主要思潮最相矛盾的。</td>
		<td class="en">In politics, an almost unbounded confidence in the efficacy of two things: representative government, and complete freedom of discussion. So complete was my father’s reliance on the influence of reason over the minds of mankind, whenever it is allowed to reach them, that he felt as if all would be gained if the whole population were taught to read, if all sorts of opinions were allowed to be addressed to them by word and in writing, and if by means of the suffrage they could nominate a legislature to give effect to the opinions they adopted. He thought that when the legislature no longer represented a class interest, it would aim at the general interest, honestly and with adequate wisdom; since the people would be sufficiently under the guidance of educated intelligence, to make in general a good choice of persons to represent them, and having done so, to leave to those whom they had chosen a liberal discretion. Accordingly aristocratic rule, the government of the Few in any of its shapes, being in his eyes the only thing which stood between mankind and an administration of their affairs by the best wisdom to be found among them, was the object of his sternest disapprobation, and a democratic suffrage the principal article of his political creed, not on the ground of liberty, Rights of Man, or any of the phrases, more or less significant, by which, up to that time, democracy had usually been defended, but as the most essential of “securities for good government.” In this, too, he held fast only to what he deemed essentials; he was comparatively indifferent to monarchical or republican forms—far more so than Bentham, to whom a king, in the character of “corrupter-general,” appeared necessarily very noxious. Next to aristocracy, an established church, or corporation of priests, as being by position the great depravers of religion, and interested in opposing the progress of the human mind, was the object of his greatest detestation; though he disliked no clergyman personally who did not deserve it, and was on terms of sincere friendship with several. In ethics, his moral feelings were energetic and rigid on all points which he deemed important to human well being, while he was supremely indifferent in opinion (though his indifference did not shew itself in personal conduct) to all those doctrines of the common morality, which he thought had no foundation but in asceticism and priestcraft. He looked forward, for example, to a considerable increase of freedom in the relations between the sexes, though without pretending to define exactly what would be, or ought to be, the precise conditions of that freedom. This opinion was connected in him with no sensuality either of a theoretical or of a practical kind. He anticipated, on the contrary, as one of the beneficial effects of increased freedom, that the imagination would no longer dwell upon the physical relation and its adjuncts, and swell this into one of the principal objects of life; a perversion of the imagination and feelings, which he regarded as one of the deepest seated and most pervading evils in the human mind. In psychology, his fundamental doctrine was the formation of all human character by circumstances, through the universal Principle of Association, and the consequent unlimited possibility of improving the moral and intellectual condition of mankind by education. Of all his doctrines none was more important than this, or needs more to be insisted on: unfortunately there is none which is more contradictory to the prevailing tendencies of speculation, both in his time and since. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I conceive that the description so often given of a Benthamite, as a mere reasoning machine, though extremely inapplicable to most of those who have been designated by that title, was during two or three years of my life not altogether untrue of me. It was perhaps as applicable to me as it can well be to any one just entering into life, to whom the common objects of desire must in general have at least the attraction of novelty. There is nothing very extraordinary in this fact: no youth of the age I then was, can be expected to be more than one thing, and this was the thing I happened to be. Ambition and desire of distinction, I had in abundance; and zeal for what I thought the good of mankind was my strongest sentiment, mixing with and colouring all others. But my zeal was as yet little else, at that period of my life, than zeal for speculative opinions. It had not its root in genuine benevolence, or sympathy with mankind; though these qualities held their due place in my ethical standard. Nor was it connected with any high enthusiasm for ideal nobleness. Yet of this feeling I was imaginatively very susceptible; but there was at that time an intermission of its natural aliment, poetical culture, while there was a superabundance of the discipline antagonistic to it, that of mere logic and analysis. Add to this that, as already mentioned, my father’s teachings tended to the undervaluing of feeling. It was not that he was himself cold-hearted or insensible; I believe it was rather from the contrary quality; he thought that feeling could take care of itself; that there was sure to be enough of it if actions were properly cared about. Offended by the frequency with which, in ethical and philosophical controversy, feeling is made the ultimate reason and justification of conduct, instead of being itself called on for a justification, while, in practice, actions, the effect of which on human happiness is mischievous, are defended as being required by feeling, and the character of a person of feeling obtains a credit for desert, which he thought only due to actions, he had a real impatience of attributing praise to feeling, or of any but the most sparing reference to it, either in the estimation of persons or in the discussion of things. In addition to the influence which this characteristic in him, had on me and others, we found all the opinions to which we attached most importance, constantly attacked on the ground of feeling. Utility was denounced as cold calculation; political economy as hard-hearted; antipopulation doctrines as repulsive to the natural feelings of mankind. We retorted by the word “sentimentality,” which, along with “declamation” and “vague generalities,” served us as common terms of opprobrium. Although we were generally in the right, as against those who were opposed to us, the effect was that the cultivation of feeling (except the feelings of public and private duty), was not in much esteem among us, and had very little place in the thoughts of most of us, myself in particular. What we principally thought of, was to alter people’s opinions; to make them believe according to evidence, and know what was their real interest, which when they once knew, they would, we thought, by the instrument of opinion, enforce a regard to it upon one another. While fully recognizing the superior excellence of unselfish benevolence and love of justice, we did not expect the regeneration of mankind from any direct action on those sentiments, but from the effect of educated intellect, enlightening the selfish feelings. Although this last is prodigiously important as a means of improvement in the hands of those who are themselves impelled by nobler principles of action, I do not believe that any one of the survivors of the Benthamites or Utilitarians of that day, now relies mainly upon it for the general amendment of human conduct. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种理论上以及实践上对情感陶冶的忽视，必然导致的结果之一就是对诗歌和想象力的低估，只一般地把它们看作是人性的一个因素。功利主义者普遍认为，或者曾经认为，他们是诗歌的敌人。对于边沁本人，这确有几分正确。他经常说，“所有诗歌都是错误的表达”，但是，按照他所说的意思，这句话也同样可以用于所有感人的演说，以及所有比数学里的算术题更具演说特征的陈述和教导。《威斯敏斯特评论》第一期中有一篇宾厄姆的文章，他在里面解释了自己不喜欢穆尔的一些地方，说“穆尔先生是诗人，因此，不是推理家”，这在很大程度上给《威斯敏斯特评论》的作家冠上了讨厌诗歌的声名。但事实上，我们很多人都是诗歌的热心读者。宾汉姆本人也曾写过诗，至于我（也可以这么说我父亲），正确的说法是我并非不喜欢诗歌，而是在理论上对它漠不关心。在散文中我不喜欢的情感，在诗歌中我也不会喜欢，这种情感有很多。我完全无视它作为教化情感的方法在人类文化中的位置。但我自己总是很容易受到某些情感的感染。在我功利主义思想最狭隘的时期，我碰巧研读了蒲柏的长诗《原人篇》，尽管里面的每个观点都与我的相反，但是我清楚地记得它对我的想象力产生了多么强有力的影响。当时任何比用诗体写出来有说服力的讨论更高级的诗歌创作形式，可能都不会对我产生类似的影响。无论如何，我也几乎从来没给过它机会。然而，这种情形只不过是暂时的。早在我大规模扩大理性信条的基础之前，我就在精神进步的自然过程中，通过膜拜英雄人物的生活和品格——尤其是哲学英雄，而获得了最有价值的诗歌文化。对人类作出贡献的很多人，把他们从普卢塔克的《传记》中体验到的鼓舞人心的影响记录了下来。柏拉图对苏格拉底的描述，以及一些现代传记，尤其是孔多塞的《杜尔哥传》，对我产生了同样令人鼓舞的影响。《杜尔哥传》构思精巧，旨在激起最大的热情，因为它的作者是个非常贤明、高贵的人，他描绘的也是一个非常贤明、高贵的人的生平。这些和与我有共鸣的显赫代表人物的超人美德，深深地打动了我，当我需要把情感和思想提升到更崇高的领域时，我总是求助于他们，就像别人求助于最喜欢的诗人一样。我应该顺便说一下，这本书消除了我的宗派主义愚行。以“他认为所有宗派都是有害的”开头的两三页，这几页也解释了为什么杜尔哥总是把自己与百科全书编纂者截然分开，深深地印入了我的脑海。我不再标榜自己和其他人是功利主义者，不再让代词“我们”或其他任何集体称号带上宗派主义的色彩。我对内心深处真正的宗派主义则摆脱得更晚些，而且更加缓慢渐进。</td>
		<td class="en">From this neglect both in theory and in practice of the cultivation of feeling, naturally resulted, among other things, an undervaluing of poetry, and of Imagination generally, as an element of human nature. It is, or was, part of the popular notion of Benthamites, that they are enemies of poetry: this was partly true of Bentham himself; he used to say that “all poetry is misrepresentation,” but, in the sense in which he said it, the same might have been said of all impressive speech; of all representation or inculcation more oratorical in its character than a sum in arithmetic. An article of Bingham’s in the first number of the Westminster Review, in which he offered as an explanation of something which he disliked in Moore6, that “Mr. Moore is a poet, and therefore is not a reasoner,” did a good deal to attach the notion of hating poetry to the writers in the Review. But the truth was that many of us were great readers of poetry; Bingham himself had been a writer of it, while as regards me (and the same thing might be said of my father), the correct statement would be, not that I disliked poetry, but that I was theoretically indifferent to it. I disliked any sentiments in poetry which I should have disliked in prose; and that included a great deal. And I was wholly blind to its place in human culture, as a means of educating the feelings. But I was always personally very susceptible to some kinds of it. In the most sectarian period of my Benthamism, I happened to look into Pope7’s Essay on Man, and though every opinion in it was contrary to mine, I well remember how powerfully it acted on my imagination. Perhaps at that time poetical composition of any higher type than eloquent discussion in verse, might not have produced a similar effect on me: at all events I seldom gave it an opportunity. This, however, was a mere passing state. Long before I had enlarged in any considerable degree, the basis of my intellectual creed, I had obtained in the natural course of my mental progress, poetic culture of the most valuable kind, by means of reverential admiration for the lives and characters of heroic persons; especially the heroes of philosophy. The same inspiring effect which so many of the benefactors of mankind have left on record that they had experienced from Plutarch8’s Lives, was produced on me by Plato’s pictures of Socrates, and by some modern biographies, above all by Condorcet’s Life of Turgot9; a book well calculated to rouse the best sort of enthusiasm, since it contains one of the wisest and noblest of lives, delineated by one of the wisest and noblest of men. The heroic virtue of these glorious representatives of the opinions with which I sympathized, deeply affected me, and I perpetually recurred to them as others do to a favorite poet, when needing to be carried up into the more elevated regions of feeling and thought. I may observe by the way that this book cured me of my sectarian follies. The two or three pages beginning “Il regardait toute secte comme nuisible,” and explaining why Turgot always kept himself perfectly distinct from the Encyclopedists, sank deeply into my mind. I left off designating myself and others as Utilitarians, and by the pronoun “we” or any other collective designation, I ceased to afficher sectarianism. My real inward sectarianism I did not get rid of till later, and much more gradually. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">About the end of 1824, or beginning of 1825, Mr. Bentham, having lately got back his papers on Evidence from M. Dumont (whose Traité des Preuves Judiciaires, grounded on them, was then first completed and published) resolved to have them printed in the original, and bethought himself of me as capable of preparing them for the press; in the same manner as his Book of Fallacies had been recently edited by Bingham. I gladly undertook this task, and it occupied nearly all my leisure for about a year, exclusive of the time afterwards spent in seeing the five large volumes through the press. Mr. Bentham had begun this treatise three times, at considerable intervals, each time in a different manner, and each time without reference to the preceding: two of the three times he had gone over nearly the whole subject. These three masses of manuscript it was my business to condense into a single treatise; adopting the one last written as the groundwork, and incorporating with it as much of the two others as it had not completely superseded. I had also to unroll such of Bentham’s involved and parenthetical sentences, as seemed to overpass by their complexity the measure of what readers were likely to take the pains to understand. It was further Mr. Bentham’s particular desire that I should, from myself, endeavour to supply any lacunӕ which he had left; and at his instance I read, for this purpose, the most authoritative treatises on the English Law of Evidence, and commented on a few of the objectionable points of the English rules, which had escaped Bentham’s notice. I also replied to the objections which had been made to some of his doctrines, by reviewers of Dumont’s book, and added a few supplementary remarks on some of the more abstract parts of the subject, such as the theory of improbability and impossibility. The controversial part of these editorial additions was written in a more assuming tone, than became one so young and inexperienced as I was: but indeed I had never contemplated coming forward in my own person; and as an anonymous editor of Bentham, I fell into the tone of my author, not thinking it unsuitable to him or to the subject, however it might be so to me. My name as editor was put to the book after it was printed, at Mr. Bentham’s positive desire, which I in vain attempted to persuade him to forego. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就我自己的进步而言，做这份编辑工作的时间得到了非常充分的利用。在边沁的所有作品中，《司法证据原理》是内容最丰富的著作之一。证据理论本身就是他最为重要的主题之一，并且衍生出大部分其他主题，这本书包括了他所有精华思想中的一大部分，这些思想被阐释得非常充分。同时更特别的是，它包含了对当时英国法律中的缺陷和瑕疵极为详尽的披露，这些在他的作品中可以找到。通过例证事件，这一披露不局限于证据法，还包括了威斯敏斯特议会大厅里的整套程序和做法。因此，通过编辑这本书而获得的，比简单阅读更深刻地镌刻在我脑海中的直接知识，本身就是不小的收获。但是，这项工作给我带来的东西似乎比预期的还要多。它对我的写作能力培养来说是一个很好的开端。完成这项编辑工作之后我写的每一部作品，比之前写的任何东西都明显好很多。边沁后期的文风，如世人所知，较为沉闷，繁琐。由于过度追求质量，喜欢精确，他的每个句子都是一个从句嵌着另一个从句，直到句子的中心，这样读者可能会同时接受所有的修饰、限定语和主命题。这种习惯在他身上日益增长，直到让不习惯读他句子的人读起来非常费力。但是他早期的文风，如《政府片论》和《司法机构计划》的风格，却是轻松活泼与内容丰富相结合的典范，几乎从未被超越，在《证据论》的手稿中，有很多显著的有着早期风格的例子，所有这些我都尽力保存。编辑这部令人钦佩的著述花了如此长的时间，这对我自己的写作产生了很大影响。另外我还刻苦地研读了其他作家的作品，法语的和英语的都有，这些作品在相当大的程度上既挥洒自如又铿锵有力，比如哥尔德斯密斯、菲尔丁、帕斯卡、伏尔泰和库里耶。由于这些作品的影响，我的作品丢掉了早期的空洞性，变得日趋饱满，有血有肉，风格有时很活泼，甚至几近明快。</td>
		<td class="en">The time occupied in this editorial work was extremely well employed in respect to my own improvement. The “Rationale of Judicial Evidence” is one of the richest in matter of all Bentham’s productions. The theory of evidence being in itself one of the most important of his subjects, and ramifying into most of the others, the book contains, very fully developed, a great proportion of all his best thoughts: while, among more special things, it comprises the most elaborate exposure of the vices and defects of English law, as it then was, which is to be found in his works; not confined to the law of evidence, but including, by way of illustrative episode, the entire procedure or practice of Westminster Hall. The direct knowledge, therefore, which I obtained from the book, and which was imprinted upon me much more thoroughly than it could have been by mere reading, was itself no small acquisition. But this occupation did for me what might seem less to be expected; it gave a great start to my powers of composition. Everything which I wrote subsequently to this editorial employment, was markedly superior to anything that I had written before it. Bentham’s later style, as the world knows, was heavy and cumbersome, from the excess of a good quality, the love of precision, which made him introduce clause within clause into the heart of every sentence, that the reader might receive into his mind all the modifications and qualifications simultaneously with the main proposition: and the habit grew on him until his sentences became, to those not accustomed to them, most laborious reading. But his earlier style, that of the Fragment on Government, Plan of a Judicial Establishment, &c., is a model of liveliness and ease combined with fullness of matter, scarcely ever surpassed: and of this earlier style there were many striking specimens in the manuscripts on Evidence, all of which I endeavoured to preserve. So long a course of this admirable writing had a considerable effect upon my own; and I added to it by the assiduous reading of other writers, both French and English, who combined, in a remarkable degree, ease with force, such as Goldsmith, Fielding, Pascal, Voltaire, and Courier. Through these influences my writing lost the jejuneness of my early compositions; the bones and cartilages began to clothe themselves with flesh, and the style became, at times, lively and almost light. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种进步最初在一个新领域展现了出来。利兹的马歇尔先生是这一代马歇尔家族的族长，在格兰庞德选区的代表权被剥夺并移交至约克郡后，他代表约克郡进入了议会——他是位热心的议会改革家，富有而慷慨，边沁的《谬误集》给他以很大冲击。他有了一个想法，觉得每年出版一次议会辩论的记录文件会很有用，不是按照《英国议会议事录》采用的时间次序，而是按主题分类，通过加上注释指出发言人的谬误。带着这个目的，他很自然地和《谬误集》的编辑宾厄姆取得了联系，在查尔斯·奥斯丁的协助下，宾厄姆担任了编辑的职务。这个刊物叫《议会历史与评论》。它的销售量不足以维持它的存续，只坚持了三年。然而，它引起了议员和政治人物的注意。团体的最大力量得以展现出来，它的发行给他们带来的荣誉远比《威斯敏斯特评论》多得多。宾厄姆和查尔斯.奥斯丁写了很多文章，还有斯特拉特、罗米利和好几位信仰自由主义的律师都写了不少文章。我父亲以他最好的文风写了一篇论文，年长的奥斯丁写了另一篇。库尔逊写了一篇，具有重要价值。这次我负责以1825年议会会议的主要议题，即天主教协会和天主教的无能为主题，写一篇文章作为第一期的开篇。在第二期上，我精心写了一篇名为《论1825年的商业危机和货币争论》的评论。在第三期上，我写了两篇文章，一篇写的是小事情，另一篇写商业里的互惠原理，是关于坎宁和加勒廷之间著名的外交通信。这些作品不再仅仅是再现和应用我学到的教条。它们是崭新的思考，如果新思考可以用来指代以新形式和新关系表现旧观点的话。如果我说它们展现出成熟、融会贯通的特征，这并没有夸大事实，这些特征在我之前的任何作品中都是没有的。因此，在表达时这些思想也并不显得幼稚。但是它们的主题要么已经过时了，要么在那之后得到了更好的论述，所以它们已被完全超越了，应该和我发表在《威斯敏斯特评论》上的第一代文章一样，被埋没在人们遗忘的角落。</td>

Mr. Marshall, of Leeds, father of the present generation of Marshalls, the same who was brought into Parliament for Yorkshire, when the representation forfeited by Grampound was transferred to it, an earnest Parliamentary reformer, and a man of large fortune, of which he made a liberal use, had been much struck with Bentham’s Book of Fallacies: and the thought had occurred to him that it would be useful to publish annually the Parliamentary Debates, not in the chronological order of Hansard, but classified according to subjects, and accompanied by a commentary pointing out the fallacies of the speakers. With this intention, he very naturally addressed himself to the editor of The Book of Fallacies; and Bingham, with the assistance of Charles Austin, undertook the editorship. The work was called “Parliamentary History and Review.” Its sale was not sufficient to keep it in existence, and it only lasted three years. It excited, however, some attention among parliamentary and political people. The best strength of the party was put forth in it; and its execution did them much more credit than that of the Westminster Review had ever done. Bingham and Charles Austin wrote much in it; as did Strutt, Romilly, and several other liberal lawyers. My father wrote one article in his best style; the elder Austin another. Coulson wrote one of great merit. It fell to my lot to lead off the first number by an article on the principal topic of the session (that of 1825), the Catholic Association and the Catholic disabilities. In the second number I wrote an elaborate Essay on the Commercial Crisis of 1825 and the Currency Debates. In the third I had two articles, one on a minor subject, the other on the Reciprocity principle in commerce, à propos of a celebrated diplomatic correspondence between Canning and Gallatin10. These writings were no longer mere reproductions and applications of the doctrines I had been taught; they were original thinking, as far as that name can be applied to old ideas in new forms and connexions: and I do not exceed the truth in saying that there was a maturity, and a well-digested character about them, which there had not been in any of my previous performances. In execution, therefore, they were not at all juvenile; but their subjects have either gone by, or have been so much better treated since, that they are entirely superseded, and should remain buried in the same oblivion with my contributions to the first dynasty of the Westminster Review.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管这样沉浸于为公众写作，我并没有忽视其他形式的自学。就在这时，我学了德语，开始学时用了汉密尔顿的方法，为此，我和好几个同伴组成了一个班。从这时起，之后的好几年中，我们的集体学习初具规模，并对我的思想进步起到了很大作用。我们想起一个点子，就是通过阅读和交谈，继续共同学习我们想熟练掌握的好几个自然科学的分支。我们聚集了12个人或者更多。格罗特先生把他在针线街的房子借了一间供我们学习用，他的伙伴、功利主义学会三名创始人之一的普雷斯科特也成了我们的一员。我们每个星期有两天上午见面，从八点半到十点，在这几个小时里，我们大部分人都放弃了自己的日常工作。我们的第一个主题是政治经济学。我们选了一些系统的论文作为教科书，我父亲的《政治经济学要义》是我们的首选。先由我们中的一个人朗读书中的一章或者一小部分，然后讨论就开始了，任何人有异议或者有其他评论的话，就直接发言。我们的规则是要彻底讨论提出的每一个要点，不论大小，一直讨论到所有参与者都满意自己得出的结论为止。要把这一章或交谈中产生的每个思考话题探究到底，从不丢下不管，直到解决我们发现的每个复杂问题为止。我们曾多次持续好几个星期连续讨论某一个话题，在不见面的时候专心思考，设法解决上次讨论时出现的新困难。我们以这种方式学完了父亲的《政治经济学要义》之后，又以同样的方法学了李嘉图的《政治经济学原理》，和贝利的《价值论文》。这些彻底的、热烈的讨论不仅大大提升了那些参与者的素质，还催生了抽象政治经济学一些主题的新观点。我后来发表的国际价值理论就起源于这些交谈，而后我在《论利润和利益》中所阐述的李嘉图利润理论的改良形式也是如此。在我们当中，新思想主要起源于埃利斯、格雷厄姆和我。但是其他人也给了这些讨论有价值的帮助，尤其是普雷斯科特和罗巴克，一个通过知识，另一个通过辩证的敏锐。国际价值理论和利润理论是由我和格雷厄姆共同思考和总结出来的，两人平分秋色。如果我们最初的方案得以执行的话，我的《论政治经济学中若干未解决的问题》就应该和他的一些论文一起出版，署上我们两人的名字。但是我开始撰文时发现自己过高地估计了与他的一致性，而他对《论国际价值》从最开始的两篇评论就持不同意见，所以我不得不认为这个理论现在只属于我自己，多年后出版的时候也只署了我的名字。我应该提到，我父亲在《政治经济学要义》第三版中作的修正，有好几处是基于从这些交谈中得出的批评。特别是把他的观点中我注意到的两点作了修改（尽管没有修改到我们最新推断的程度）。</td>
		<td class="en">While thus engaged in writing for the public, I did not neglect other modes of self-cultivation. It was at this time that I learnt German; beginning it on the Hamiltonian method, for which purpose I and several of my companions formed a class. For several years from this period, our social studies assumed a shape which contributed very much to my mental progress. The idea occurred to us of carrying on, by reading and conversation, a joint study of several of the branches of science which we wished to be masters of. We assembled to the number of a dozen or more. Mr. Grote lent a room of his house in Threadneedle Street for the purpose, and his partner, Prescott, one of the three original members of the Utilitarian Society, made one among us. We met two mornings in every week, from half-past eight till ten, at which hour most of us were called off to our daily occupations. Our first subject was Political Economy. We chose some systematic treatise as our textbook; my father’s Elements being our first choice. One of us read aloud a chapter, or some smaller portion, of the book. The discussion was then opened, and any one who had an objection, or other remark to make, made it. Our rule was to discuss thoroughly every point raised, whether great or small, prolonging the discussion until all who took part were satisfied with the conclusion they had individually arrived at; and to follow up every topic of collateral speculation which the chapter or the conversation suggested, never leaving it until we had untied every knot which we found. We repeatedly kept up the discussion of some one point for several weeks, thinking intently on it during the intervals of our meetings, and contriving solutions of the new difficulties which had risen up in the last morning’s discussion. When we had finished in this way my father’s Elements, we went in the same manner through Ricardo’s Principles of Political Economy, and Bailey’s Dissertation on Value. These close and vigorous discussions were not only improving in a high degree to those who took part in them, but brought out new views of some topics of abstract Political Economy. The theory of International Values which I afterwards published, emanated from these conversations, as did also the modified form of Ricardo’s theory of Profits, laid down in my Essay on Profits and Interest. Those among us with whom new speculations chief ly originated, were Ellis, Graham, and I; though others gave valuable aid to the discussions, especially Prescott and Roebuck, the one by his knowledge, the other by his dialectical acuteness. The theories of International Values and of Profits were excogitated and worked out in about equal proportions by myself and Graham: and if our original project had been executed, my Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy would have been brought out along with some papers of his, under our joint names. But when my exposition came to be written, I found that I had so much over-estimated my agreement with him, and he dissented so much from the most original of the two Essays, that on International Values, that I was obliged to consider the theory as now exclusively mine, and it came out as such when published many years later. I may mention that among the alterations which my father made in revising his Elements for the third edition, several were founded on criticisms elicited by these conversations; and in particular he modified his opinions (though not to the extent of our new speculations) on both the points to which I have adverted. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >学完政治经济学后，我们以同样的方式开始学习三段论逻辑学，此时格罗特加入了我们。我们的第一本课本是奥尔德里奇的著作，但是由于不喜欢它的肤浅，我们重印了耶稣会士迪特里厄的《逻辑学入门》，在很多学院逻辑学的参考书中这本是非常完美的，我父亲热衷于收集此类书籍，我们印的就是他收藏的。读完这本之后，我们开始继续读惠特利的《逻辑学》，当时刚被《大都会百科全书》第一次再版，最后读了霍布斯的《计算法和逻辑学》。以我们自己的方式读的这些书，为新颖的形而上学思考提供了广阔的空间。我在《逻辑学体系》第一本里做的大部分工作，如阐释和校正学院逻辑学家的原则和特征、改进命题意义的理论等，都根源于这些讨论。新颖的思想大都是格雷厄姆和我提出的，而格罗特和其他人则提供了极好的公断，或者说检验。从这时起，我计划要写一本关于逻辑学的作品，尽管其规模与我最终的成书相比小很多。</td>
		<td class="en">When we had enough of political economy, we took up the syllogistic logic in the same manner, Grote now joining us. Our first text-book was Aldrich, but being disgusted with its superficiality, we reprinted one of the most f inished among the many manuals of the school logic, which my father, a great collector of such books, possessed, the Manuductio ad Logicam of the Jesuit Du Trieu. After finishing this, we took up Whately’s Logic, then first republished from the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, and finally the Computatio sive Logica of Hobbes11. These books, dealt with in our manner, afforded a wide range for original metaphysical speculation: and most of what has been done in the First Book of my System of Logic, to rationalize and correct the principles and distinctions of the school logicians, and to improve the theory of the Import of Propositions, had its origin in these discussions; Graham and I originating most of the novelties, while Grote and others furnished an excellent tribunal or test. From this time I formed the project of writing a book on Logic, though on a much humbler scale than the one I ultimately executed. </td></tr>

When we had finished Hartley, we suspended our meetings; but, my father’s Analysis of the Mind being published soon after, we reassembled for the purpose of reading it. With this our exercises ended. I have always dated from these conversations my own real inauguration as an original and independent thinker. It was also through them that I acquired, or very much strengthened, a mental habit to which I attribute all that I have ever done, or ever shall do, in speculation; that of never accepting half-solutions of difficulties as complete; never abandoning a puzzle, but again and again returning to it until it was cleared up; never allowing obscure corners of a subject to remain unexplored, because they did not appear important; never thinking that I perfectly understood any part of a subject until I understood the whole. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">There was for some time in existence a society of Owenites13, called the Cooperative Society, which met for weekly public discussions in Chancery Lane. In the early part of 1825, accident brought Roebuck in contact with several of its members, and led to his attending one or two of the meetings and taking part in the debate in opposition to Owenism. Some one of us started the notion of going there in a body and having a general battle: and Charles Austin and some of his friends who did not usually take part in our joint exercises, entered into the project. It was carried out by concert with the principal members of the Society, themselves nothing loth, as they naturally preferred a controversy with opponents to a tame discussion among their own body. The question of population was proposed as the subject of debate: Charles Austin led the case on our side with a brilliant speech, and the fight was kept up by adjournment through five or six weekly meetings before crowded auditories, including along with the members of the Society and their friends, many hearers and some speakers from the Inns of Court14 When this debate was ended, another was commenced on the general merits of Owen’s system: and the contest altogether lasted about three months. It was a lutte corps-à-corps between Owenites and political economists, whom the Owenites regarded as their most inveterate opponents: but it was a perfectly friendly dispute. We who represented political economy, had the same objects in view as they had, and took pains to show it; and the principal champion on their side was a very estimable man, with whom I was well acquainted, Mr. William Thompson, of Cork, author of a book on the Distribution of Wealth, and of an Appeal in behalf of women against the passage relating to them in my father’s Essay on Government. Ellis, Roebuck, and I, took an active part in the debate, and among those from the Inns of Court who joined in it, I remember Charles Villiers. The other side obtained also, on the population question, very efficient support from without. The well known Gale Jones, then an elderly man, made one of his florid speeches; but the speaker with whom I was most struck, though I dissented from nearly every word he said, was Thirlwall, the historian, since Bishop of St. David’s, then a Chancery barrister, unknown except by a high reputation for eloquence acquired at the Cambridge Union before the era of Austin and Macaulay. His speech was in answer to one of mine. Before he had uttered ten sentences, I set him down as the best speaker I had ever heard, and I have never since heard any one whom I placed above him. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对这些辩论的巨大兴趣让一些参与者很容易地接受了政治经济学家麦卡洛克提出的一个建议，即伦敦需要有一个和爱丁堡思辨学会相似的学会，爱丁堡的思辨学会是布鲁厄姆、霍纳和其他一些人最初培养演说能力的地方。我们在合作社的经历似乎让人相信我们就是可以聚集在伦敦共同做这样一件事情的人。麦卡洛克跟几位有影响力的年轻人提过这件事，那时他正给他们单独讲授政治经济学的课程。他们中有几位热心地加入了这个计划，尤其是后来成为克拉伦登伯爵的乔治.威利尔斯。他和他的兄弟海德和查尔斯、罗米利、查尔斯.奥斯汀，还有我，以及其他一些人会面并达成一个计划，我们决定从11月到6月在共济会会员的旅馆每两星期集会一次，我们很快就有了不少杰出的会员，连同好几位议会议员一起，几乎囊括了剑桥协会和牛津联合辩论协会所有的著名演说家。我们的主要困难在于为学会征募足够的保守党演说者，这一点很奇特地反映了当时的趋势。我们能紧急找来的几乎都是来自不同阶层、不同学历的自由主义者。除了已经提到的，还有麦考利、瑟尔沃尔、普雷德、豪伊克勋爵、塞缪尔.威尔伯福斯（后来成为牛津的主教）、查尔斯.波利特.汤姆森（后来成为悉登汉姆勋爵）、爱德华、亨利.利顿.布尔沃、方布兰克，还有很多我现在想不起来的人，但他们后来都或多或少在公共或文学领域中有出色的表现。一切看起来都充满希望。行动的日子要到了，这时需要确定一个主席，并找一个人作开场辩论，但是我们的名人中没有一个同意履行两个职责中的任何一个。我们敦促很多人做这件事，但被说服了的只有一个，我对此人知之甚少，但他在牛津很受尊敬，据说在那儿获得了很高的演说上的声誉，后来成了议会的保守党议员。因此，我们就确定他担任主席一职，并第一个发言。重大的日子到了，长凳上挤满了人，我们所有伟大的演说家都到场了，但他们是来评价我们的努力，而不是来帮忙的。这位牛津演说家的演说彻底失败了。这让所有人都很沮丧，接下来演说的人很少，而且没有一个发挥出最佳状态，彻底惨败。我们曾指望的演说名人离开了，再也没回来，这至少在了解世事上给了我一个教训。这个意外的事故改变了我和这个计划的整个关系。我以前没有想过要扮演主要角色或者经常演讲，尤其是一开始的时候。但是，现在我发现这个计划的成功要依靠新人，我决定担起重任。我在第二个问题上首先发言，从那时起，我几乎在每次辩论中都发言。有一阵子这是非常艰难的工作。威利尔斯三兄弟和罗米利与我们一起坚持了比较长的时间，但是最终除了我和罗巴克，协会所有创始人的耐心还是耗尽了。在接下来的时期里（1826—1827年），情况开始好转。我们得到了两个卓越的保守党演说家的支持：海沃德和希（后来成为高级律师）。随着查尔斯·布勒、科伯恩和剑桥功利主义者第二代一些人的加入，激进主义这一边也得以加强；有他们和其他人的偶尔协助，加上两个保守党党员，罗巴克和我定期发言，使得几乎每一次辩论都是“哲学激进分子”和保守党律师之间的对阵战。一直到人们开始议论我们的辩论，好几个受人尊敬的著名人物来听我们的辩论为止。在接下来1828—1829年的辩论季当中，这种情况更多了，当时以莫里斯和斯特林为代表的浪漫主义者，作为第二个自由主义甚至激进主义派别出现在学会里，他们的依据与功利主义完全不同，而且激烈地反对功利主义。他们把欧洲反对18世纪哲学时普遍使用的学说和思考方式带到这些讨论中来，并成为我们论战中非常重要的好战第三方，当时他们是新一代思想运动中最有教养的倡导者。我们的辩论和普通辩论协会中的大不相同，因为我们双方都能提出来最有说服力的论点和最具哲学性的原则，使得双方的互相驳斥经常陷于激烈的势均力敌的状态。这种实践对我们来说非常有益，不可或缺，尤其是对我。其实，我从来没获得真正流畅的表达能力，表达的时候总是很差，不优美，但我还是能抓住听众的注意力。由于我总是在表达看起来很重要的时候才写演讲稿，不论是从内心的感情出发，还是从要阐明观点的本质出发，我都大大提高了实际写作的能力，不仅能够分辨语言是否流利和有节奏，还能实际地辨别有说服力的句子，并通过它们对不同观众的效果，直接评判它们的说服力。</td>
		<td class="en">The great interest of these debates predisposed some of those who took part in them, to catch at a suggestion thrown out by McCulloch, the political economist, that a Society was wanted in London similar to the Speculative Society at Edinburgh, in which Brougham15, Horner, and others first cultivated public speaking. Our experience at the Cooperative Society seemed to give cause for being sanguine as to the sort of men who might be brought together in London for such a purpose. McCulloch mentioned the matter to several young men of influence, to whom he was then giving private lessons in political economy. Some of these entered warmly into the project, particularly George Villiers, afterwards Earl of Clarendon. He and his brothers, Hyde and Charles, Romilly, Charles Austin and I, with some others, met and agreed on a plan. We determined to meet once a fortnight from November to June, at the Freemason’s Tavern, and we had soon a splendid list of members, containing, along with several members of Parliament, nearly all the most noted speakers of the Cambridge Union and of the Oxford United Debating Society. It is curiously illustrative of the tendencies of the time, that our principal difficulty in recruiting for the Society was to find a sufficient number of Tory speakers. Almost all whom we could press into the service were Liberals, of different orders and degrees. Besides those already named, we had Macaulay, Thirlwall, Praed, Lord Howick, Samuel Wilberforce (afterwards Bishop of Oxford), Charles Poulett Thomson (afterwards Lord Sydenham), Edward and Henry Lytton Bulwer, Fonblanque, and many others whom I cannot now recollect, but who made themselves afterwards more or less conspicuous in public or literary life. Nothing could seem more promising. But when the time for action drew near, and it was necessary to fix on a President, and find somebody to open the first debate, none of our celebrities would consent to perform either office. Of the many who were pressed on the subject, the only one who could be prevailed on was a man of whom I knew very little, but who had taken high honours at Oxford and was said to have acquired a great oratorical reputation there; who some time afterwards became a Tory member of Parliament. He accordingly was fixed on, both for filling the President’s chair and for making the first speech. The important day arrived; the benches were crowded; all our great speakers were present, to judge of, but not to help our efforts. The Oxford orator’s speech was a complete failure. This threw a damp on the whole concern: the speakers who followed were few, and none of them did their best: the affair was a complete fiasco; and the oratorical celebrities we had counted on went away never to return, giving to me at least a lesson in knowledge of the world. This unexpected breakdown altered my whole relation to the project. I had not anticipated taking a prominent part, or speaking much or often, particularly at first, but I now saw that the success of the scheme depended on the new men, and I put my shoulder to the wheel. I opened the second question, and from that time spoke in nearly every debate. It was very uphill work for some time. The three Villiers’ and Romilly stuck to us for some time longer, but the patience of all the founders of the Society was at last exhausted, except me and Roebuck. In the season following, 1826—7, things began to mend. We had acquired two excellent Tory speakers, Hayward, and Shee (afterwards Sergeant Shee): the Radical side was reinforced by Charles Buller, Cockburn, and others of the second generation of Cambridge Benthamites; and with their and other occasional aid, and the two Tories as well as Roebuck and me for regular speakers, almost every debate was a bataille rangée between the “philosophic Radicals” and the Tory lawyers; until our conflicts were talked about, and several persons of note and consideration came to hear us. This happened still more in the subsequent seasons, 1828 and 1829, when the Coleridgians, in the persons of Maurice and Sterling, made their appearance in the Society as a second Liberal and even Radical party, on totally different grounds from Benthamism and vehemently opposed to it; bringing into these discussions the general doctrines and modes of thought of the European reaction against the philosophy of the eighteenth century; and adding a third and very important belligerent party to our contests, which were now no bad exponent of the movement of opinion among the most cultivated part of the new generation. Our debates were very different from those of common debating societies, for they habitually consisted of the strongest arguments and most philosophic principles which either side was able to produce, thrown often into close and serré confutations of one another. The practice was necessarily very useful to us, and eminently so to me. I never, indeed, acquired real fluency, and had always a bad and ungraceful delivery; but I could make myself listened to: and as I always wrote my speeches when, from the feelings involved, or the nature of the ideas to be developed, expression seemed important，I greatly increased my power of effective writing; acquiring not only an ear for smoothness and rhythm, but a practical sense for telling sentences, and an immediate criterion of their telling property, by their effect on a mixed audience. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >协会以及为协会做的准备工作，加上为同时进行的上午交谈做的准备，占用了我大部分的闲暇时间。因此1828年春天，我停止为《威斯敏斯特评论》写稿的时候，感觉轻松了不少。评论杂志陷入了困境。尽管第一期的销售量非常振奋人心，但是我相信，以评论杂志开展的规模来说长期的销售量从未能应付开支。开支已经缩减了很多，但是缩减得还是不够。一个编辑——萨瑟恩——已经辞职了。好几个作者，包括父亲和我，早期的稿件和其他撰稿人一样获得稿酬，但最近已经没有报酬了。然而，原始资金已几近耗尽，或者已经完全耗尽了，如果这份刊物想继续维持下去的话，必须重新安排它的事务。我父亲和我就这个问题和鲍林讨论了好几次。我们乐意尽力维持评论杂志，让它作为我们观点的喉舌，但是不用鲍林做我们的编辑。而报纸无法再负担有偿编辑给我们提供了一个理由，既不会冒犯到他，又可以提议免去他的职责。我们，还有一些朋友，都准备好了做无偿作者，继续维持评论报，要么在我们中间找一个无偿的编辑，要么共同承担编辑之职。但是，就当谈判在鲍林的明显默许下正在进行的时候，他却在另一个地区进行另一个谈判（和佩罗内特.汤普森上校），我们收到的第一个通告是鲍林作为编辑给我们写的一封信，仅仅告诉我们说做了些安排，建议我们为下一期写稿，承诺支付报酬。如果他有这个能力，他有权做比我们的提议更有利于他自己的安排，我们不会阻止。但是他对我们加以隐瞒，而表面上看起来还是在参加我们的计划，我们觉得这是一种公开侮辱。即使我们没这么想，我们也不愿意再浪费时间和精力为他主编的《威斯敏斯特评论》继续写文章。因此，我父亲不再写文章。尽管两三年后，在巨大的压力下他不得不写了一篇政论文。至于我，则坚决拒绝了再为其撰稿。这样，我和原先的《威斯敏斯特评论》的联系终止了。我在上面写的最后一篇文章，付出的努力比以往任何文章都多。但是这是出于爱的努力，因为它是为早期法国革命家辩护，反对沃尔特.司各特爵士在他的《拿破仑传》序言中对他们保守的曲解。为了写这篇文章，要做笔记，做摘录，为此所读的书的数量——甚至我必须购买的数量（因为那时候没有能把参考书借回家的公共图书馆或订阅图书馆），远远超过了直接目标的价值。但是，我当时有个写法国大革命史的不成熟的想法。尽管我从来没有付诸实际，但是我的藏书后来对卡莱尔写类似的作品非常有用。</td>
		<td class="en">The Society, and the preparation for it, together with the preparation for the morning conversations which were going on simultaneously, occupied the greater part of my leisure; and made me feel it a relief when, in the spring of 1828, I ceased to write for the Westminster. The Review had fallen into difficulties. Though the sale of the first number had been very encouraging, the permanent sale had never, I believe, been sufficient to pay the expenses, on the scale on which the review was carried on. Those expenses had been considerably, but not sufficiently, reduced. One of the editors, Southern, had resigned; and several of the writers, including my father and me, who had been paid like other contributors for our earlier articles, had latterly written without payment. Nevertheless, the original funds were nearly or quite exhausted, and if the Review was to be continued some new arrangement of its affairs had become indispensable. My father and I had several conferences with Bowring on the subject. We were willing to do our utmost for maintaining the Review as an organ of our opinions, but not under Bowring’s editorship: while the impossibility of its any longer supporting a paid editor, afforded a ground on which, without affront to him, we could propose to dispense with his services. We and some of our friends, were prepared to carry on the Review as unpaid writers, either finding among ourselves an unpaid editor, or sharing the editorship among us. But while this negotiation was proceeding with Bowring’s apparent acquiescence, he was carrying on another in a different quarter (with Colonel Perronet Thompson), of which we received the first intimation in a letter from Bowring as editor, informing us merely that an arrangement had been made, and proposing to us to write for the next number, with promise of payment. We did not dispute Bowring’s right to bring about, if he could, an arrangement more favorable to himself than the one we had proposed; but we thought the concealment which he had practised towards us, while seemingly entering into our own project, an affront: and even had we not thought so, we were indisposed to expend any more of our time and trouble in attempting to write up the Review under his management. Accordingly my father excused himself from writing; though two or three years later, on great pressure, he did write one more political article. As for me, I positively refused. And thus ended my connexion with the original Westminster. The last article which I wrote in it had cost me more labour than any previous; but it was a labour of love, being a defence of the early French Revolutionists against the Tory misrepresentations of Sir Walter Scott16, in the introduction to his Life of Napoleon. The number of books which I read for this purpose, making notes and extracts—even the number I had to buy (for in those days there was no public or subscription library from which books of reference could be taken home), far exceeded the worth of the immediate object; but I had at that time a half-formed intention of writing a History of the French Revolution; and though I never executed it, my collections afterwards were very useful to Carlyle17 for a similar purpose.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">From the winter of 1821, when I first read Bentham, and especially from the commencement of the Westminster Review, I had what might truly be called an object in life: to be a reformer of the world. My conception of my own happiness was entirely identified with this object. The personal sympathies I wished for were those of fellow labourers in this enterprise. I endeavoured to pick up as many flowers as I could by the way; but as a serious and permanent personal satisfaction to rest upon, my whole reliance was placed on this; and I was accustomed to felicitate myself on the certainty of a happy life which I enjoyed, through placing my happiness in something durable and distant, in which some progress might be always making, while it could never be exhausted by complete attainment. This did very well for several years, during which the general improvement going on in the world and the idea of myself as engaged with others in struggling to promote it, seemed enough to fill up an interesting and animated existence. But the time came when I awakened from this as from a dream. It was in the autumn of 1826. I was in a dull state of nerves, such as everybody is occasionally liable to; unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitement; one of those moods when what is pleasure at other times, becomes insipid or indifferent; the state, I should think, in which converts to Methodism usually are, when smitten by their first “conviction of sin.” In this frame of mind it occurred to me to put the question directly to myself: “Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to you?” And an irrepressible selfself-consciousness distinctly answered, “No!” At this my heart sank within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. All my happiness was to have been found in the continual pursuit of this end. The end had ceased to charm, and how could there ever again be any interest in the means? I seemed to have nothing left to live for. </td></tr>

I sought no comfort by speaking to others of what I felt. If I had loved any one sufficiently to make confiding my grief a necessity, I should not have been in the condition I was. I felt, too, that mine was not an interesting, or in any way respectable distress. There was nothing in it to attract sympathy. Advice, if I had known where to seek it, would have been most precious. The words of Macbeth1 to the physician often occurred to my thoughts. But there was no one on whom I could build the faintest hope of such assistance. My father, to whom it would have been natural to me to have recourse in any practical difficulties, was the last person to whom, in such a case as this, I looked for help. Everything convinced me that he had no knowledge of any such mental state as I was suffering from, and that even if he could be made to understand it, he was not the physician who could heal it. My education, which was wholly his work, had been conducted without any regard to the possibility of its ending in this result; and I saw no use in giving him the pain of thinking that his plans had failed, when the failure was probably irremediable, and, at all events, beyond the power of his remedies.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的学习过程让我相信，所有心理和道德上的情感和品质，不管是好的还是坏的，都是联系的结果。我们喜欢这个东西，讨厌那个东西，进行这种行动或沉思很高兴，而进行另一种却很痛苦，这都是通过教育或经验的作用把愉快或痛苦的想法附加到这些东西上来实现的。从这种现象得出的推论就是，教育的目标应该是尽可能为有益的事物形成最强大的联系。给所有对整体有益的东西以愉快的联系。给对整体有害的东西以痛苦的联系。我总是听到父亲坚持这一结论，我自己也深信不疑。这个学说看起来坚不可摧，但回想起来，现在我觉得好像我的老师都只是很肤浅地专注于形成和维持这些有益联系的方法。他们似乎完全信任常用的旧手段，如表扬和批评、奖励和惩罚。现在我并不怀疑，如果这些方法使用得早并坚持不懈的话，就可能会创造出来痛苦和愉快的强烈联系，尤其是痛苦的联系，也可能会制造出能够持续至生命尽头都不减弱的渴望和厌恶。但是，这样产生的联系肯定总会有人为的和偶然的因素。这些痛苦和快乐是强行跟事物联系起来的，而不是通过自然纽带联系起来的。因此我想，这些联系应该在习惯运用分析能力之前就变得非常强烈和深刻，从而在现实中不会被拆开，这对于巩固这些联系至关重要。因为现在我看到了，或者觉得我看到了自己以前总是半信半疑的东西，即分析的习惯往往会折损感情。在其他思考习惯还未形成而分析精神仍没有自然的补充和矫正的时候，确实如此。（我坚持认为）分析的优点在于它往往会减弱和破坏由偏见造成的任何结果，它能让我们从心理上区分开只是偶然结合在一起的想法，任何联系最终都无法抵抗这种分解的力量，我们只能把对自然界永恒秩序的清楚认识归功于分析。事物之间的真正联系不依赖于我们的意志和感情。根据自然法则，在很多情况下一个事物在事实上和另一个事物密不可分。这些法则，按照我们清楚的感知和从想象中认识的程度，使我们对大自然中总是结合在一起的事物的认识在思想中结合得越来越紧密。因此分析的习惯甚至可能会加强原因和结果、手段和目标之间的联系，但是总体上往往会削弱纯粹感觉的东西（用大家熟悉的说法）。因此（我想）分析的习惯对于审慎和洞察力有利，但是永远是激情和美德根基处的害虫。最重要的是，它会摧毁所有由联系而成的渴望和快乐，也就是说，根据我所持的理论，除了纯物质和感官的渴望和快乐以外，其他的都会被破坏掉。我比谁都更加深信不疑，分析的习惯绝不会让生活变得愉悦。这些是人类本性的规律，我目前的状态也是这些规律作用的结果。我所尊敬的人都认为，对人类的同情所产生的快乐，那种把为别人，尤其是为人类大规模地谋取福利作为生存目标的感觉，是幸福最伟大、最可靠的源泉。我深信这是真的，但是知道拥有某种感觉能让我幸福，并不能给我这种感觉。我想教育为我创造这些感觉的力量还不够强大，无法抵挡分析的毁灭性影响，而我的整个智力培养过程都使早熟又不成熟的分析成为我思想中根深蒂固的习惯。因此我想，我在旅程刚开始时就搁浅了，虽然有装备精良的船只和舵，但是没有帆。我对做了精心准备去努力实现的目标没有真正的渴望，对美德或者公共利益没有兴趣，就像对其他事情一样。虚荣心和抱负的源泉像仁爱的源泉一样，似乎已经在我体内完全干涸了。（我回想起来）我在很小的时候虚荣心就曾获得了一些满足。在对荣誉和地位的渴望转化为激情之前，我获得了一些荣誉，觉得自己有些本事。事实上我获得的很少，而且得到的太早，就像所有享受得太快的快乐一样，它让我对这种追求感到厌倦和冷漠。因此，无论是自私的或不自私的快乐，对我来说都不是快乐。自然界似乎也没有什么力量能重塑我的性格，在一个如今无法复原分析能力的头脑里创造出快乐与人类渴望的任何事物之间的新联系。</td>
		<td class="en">My course of study had led me to believe, that all mental and moral feelings and qualities, whether of a good or of a bad kind, were the results of association; that we love one thing and hate another, take pleasure in one sort of action or contemplation, and pain in another sort, through the clinging of pleasurable or painful ideas to those things, from the effect of education or of experience. As a corollary from this, I had always heard it maintained by my father, and was myself convinced, that the object of education should be to form the strongest possible associations of the salutary class; associations of pleasure with all things beneficial to the great whole, and of pain with all things hurtful to it. This doctrine appeared inexpugnable; but it now seemed to me on retrospect, that my teachers had occupied themselves but superficially with the means of forming and keeping up these salutary associations. They seemed to have trusted altogether to the old familiar instruments, praise and blame, reward and punishment. Now, I did not doubt that by these means, begun early, and applied unremittingly, intense associations of pain and pleasure, especially of pain, might be created, and might produce desires and aversions capable of lasting undiminished to the end of life. But there must always be something artificial and casual in associations thus produced. The pains and pleasures thus forcibly associated with things, are not connected with them by any natural tie; and it is therefore, I thought, essential to the durability of these associations, that they should have become so intense and inveterate as to be practically indissoluble, before the habitual exercise of the power of analysis had commenced. For I now saw, or thought I saw, what I had always before received with incredulity—that the habit of analysis has a tendency to wear away the feelings: as indeed it has when no other mental habit is cultivated, and the analysing spirit remains without its natural complements and correctives. The very excellence of analysis (I argued) is that it tends to weaken and undermine whatever is the result of prejudice; that it enables us mentally to separate ideas which have only casually clung together: and no associations whatever could ultimately resist this dissolving force, were it not that we owe to analysis our clearest knowledge of the permanent sequences in nature; the real connexions between Things, not dependent on our will and feelings; natural laws, by virtue of which, in many cases, one thing is inseparable from another in fact; which laws, in proportion as they are clearly perceived and imaginatively realized, cause our ideas of things which are always joined together in Nature, to cohere more and more closely in our thoughts. Analytic habits may thus even strengthen the associations between causes and effects, means and ends, but tend altogether to weaken those which are, to speak familiarly, a mere matter of feeling. They are therefore (I thought) favourable to prudence and clear-sightedness, but a perpetual worm at the root both of the passions and of the virtues; and above all, fearfully undermine all desires, and all pleasures, which are the effects of association, that is, according to the theory I held, all except the purely physical and organic; of the entire insufficiency of which to make life desirable, no one had a stronger conviction than I had. These were the laws of human nature, by which, as it seemed to me, I had been brought to my present state. All those to whom I looked up, were of opinion that the pleasure of sympathy with human beings, and the feelings which made the good of others, and especially of mankind on a large scale, the object of existence, were the greatest and surest sources of happiness. Of the truth of this I was convinced, but to know that a feeling would make me happy if I had it, did not give me the feeling. My education, I thought, had failed to create these feelings in sufficient strength to resist the dissolving influence of analysis, while the whole course of my intellectual cultivation had made precocious and premature analysis the inveterate habit of my mind. I was thus, as I said to myself, left stranded at the commencement of my voyage, with a well-equipped ship and a rudder, but no sail; without any real desire for the ends which I had been so carefully fitted out to work for: no delight in virtue or the general good, but also just as little in anything else. The fountains of vanity and ambition seemed to have dried up within me, as completely as those of benevolence. I had had (as I reflected) some gratification of vanity at too early an age: I had obtained some distinction, and felt myself of some importance, before the desire of distinction and of importance had grown into a passion: and little as it was which I had attained, yet having been attained too early, like all pleasures enjoyed too soon, it had made me blasé and indifferent to the pursuit. Thus neither selfish nor unselfish pleasures were pleasures to me. And there seemed no power in nature sufficient to begin the formation of my character anew, and create in a mind now irretrievably analytic, fresh associations of pleasure with any of the objects of human desire. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">In all probability my case was by no means so peculiar as I fancied it, and I doubt not that many others have passed through a similar state; but the idiosyncracies of my education had given to the general phenomenon a special character, which made it seem the natural effect of causes that it was hardly possible for time to remove. I frequently asked myself, if I could, or if I was bound to go on living, when life must be passed in this manner. I generally answered to myself, that I did not think I could possibly bear it beyond a year. When, however, not more than half that duration of time had elapsed, a small ray of light broke in upon my gloom. I was reading, accidentally, Marmontel’s Mémoirs, and came to the passage which relates his father’s death, the distressed position of the family, and the sudden inspiration by which he, then a mere boy, felt and made them feel that he would be everything to them—would supply the place of all that they had lost. A vivid conception of the scene and its feelings came over me, and I was moved to tears. From this moment my burthen grew lighter. The oppression of the thought that all feeling was dead within me, was gone. I was no longer hopeless: I was not a stock or a stone. I had still, it seemed, some of the material out of which all worth of character, and all capacity for happiness, are made. Relieved from my ever present sense of irremediable wretchedness, I gradually found that the ordinary incidents of life could again give me some pleasure; that I could again find enjoyment, not intense, but sufficient for cheerfulness, in sunshine and sky, in books, in conversation, in public affairs; and that there was, once more, excitement, though of a moderate kind, in exerting myself for my opinions, and for the public good. Thus the cloud gradually drew off, and I again enjoyed life: and though I had several relapses, some of which lasted many months, I never again was as miserable as I had been. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这段时期的经历对我的观点和性格有两个非常明显的影响。首先，它引导我采纳了一个人生理论，和我以前遵循的理论很不一样，与卡莱尔的反自我意识理论倒有诸多相似之处，不过我当时自然对其闻所未闻。实际上，我一直坚信幸福是所有行为规则的检验标准，也是生活的目标，从没动摇过。但是现在我觉得，这个目标只有在不把它当作直接目标的时候才能实现。（我想）只有这样的人才会幸福，他们不以自己的幸福为目标，而是把精力聚焦在别的事物上。聚焦在别人的幸福、人类的进步甚至某种艺术或追求上，不是把它作为一种手段，而是把它本身当作理想的目标来追寻。这样把目标定在别的事物上，他们也顺便找到了幸福。当我们把生活中的快乐当作附带品，而不是作为首要目标来对待时，它们就足以让生活成为快乐的事情（这就是我现在的理论）。一旦把快乐作为首要目标，就会很快感觉到它们不够用，也经不起仔细的推敲。你一旦问自己是否快乐时，你就不再快乐了。唯一的办法是把快乐以外的目标，而不是快乐本身作为生活的目标。让你的自我意识，你的仔细观察，你的自我审问都耗费在那个目标上面吧。另外，如果够幸运的话，你能从空气中呼吸到快乐，不必沉思或考虑，不会在想象中阻止它，或者用可怕的质问让它溃逃。这个理论现在成了我人生哲学的基础。对于所有只拥有普通感受能力和享乐能力的人来说，换句话说，对于大多数人来说，我仍然认为它是最好的理论。</td>
		<td class="en">The experiences of this period had two very marked effects on my opinions and character. In the first place, they led me to adopt a theory of life, very unlike that on which I had before acted, and having much in common with what at that time I certainly had never heard of, the anti-self-consciousness theory of Carlyle. I never, indeed, wavered in the conviction that happiness is the test of all rules of conduct, and the end of life. But I now thought that this end was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way. The enjoyments of life (such was now my theory) are sufficient to make it a pleasant thing, when they are taken en passant, without being made a principal object. Once make them so, and they are immediately felt to be insufficient. They will not bear a scrutinizing examination. Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so. The only chance is to treat, not happiness, but some end external to it, as the purpose of life. Let your self-consciousness, your scrutiny, your self-interrogation, exhaust themselves on that; and if otherwise fortunately circumstanced you will inhale happiness with the air you breathe, without dwelling on it or thinking about it, without either forestalling it in imagination, or putting it to flight by fatal questioning. This theory now became the basis of my philosophy of life. And I still hold to it as the best theory for all those who have but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity for enjoyment, that is, for the great majority of mankind. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的观点那时经历的另一个重要变化就是我第一次把个人的精神文化当做人类福利的一个首要条件。我不再只重视外部环境的安排以及对人类思索和行动能力的训练。我现在从经验中得知，被动的感受性也像积极的能力一样需要培养，必须得到滋养、充实以及指引。我没有片刻忽略或者低估从前看到的那部分真理。我从来没有怀疑过智育，或者否认分析的能力和习惯是个人和社会进步的必要条件。但是，它的有些结果需要通过与其他培养形式结合起来得以修正。在各种能力之间保持适当的平衡在我看来是最重要的。情感培养成为我伦理和哲学信条中的基本点之一。任何看上去能有助于实现这个目标的东西都成为我的思想和爱好越来越关注的对象。</td>
		<td class="en">The other important change which my opinions at this time underwent, was that I, for the first time, gave its proper place, among the prime necessities of human well-being, to the internal culture of the individual. I ceased to attach almost exclusive importance to the ordering of outward circumstances, and the training of the human being for speculation and for action. I had now learnt by experience that the passive susceptibilities needed to be cultivated as well as the active capacities, and required to be nourished and enriched as well as guided. I did not, for an instant, lose sight of, or undervalue, that part of the truth which I had seen before; I never turned recreant to intellectual culture, or ceased to consider the power and practice of analysis as an essential condition both of individual and of social improvement. But I thought that it had consequences which required to be corrected, by joining other kinds of cultivation with it. The maintenance of a due balance among the faculties, now seemed to me of primary importance. The cultivation of the feelings became one of the cardinal points in my ethical and philosophical creed. And my thoughts and inclinations turned in an increasing degree towards whatever seemed capable of being instrumental to that object. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我现在开始发现，以前读到或听说的关于诗歌和艺术是人类文化重要传播工具的说法是很有意义的。但是通过亲身经历开始了解此事，是过了一阵子之后的事了。我从儿童时代就非常喜欢的有想象力的艺术只有音乐，音乐的最佳作用在于激发热情（在这一点上，它可能超越了其他艺术），在于高度提升品质中已有的高尚情感。而音乐的刺激让这种情感发光发热，尽管这光和热处于顶点的时间很短暂，但在其他时刻用于维持高尚的情感却是很宝贵的。我经常体验音乐的这种效果。但是，和我所有愉快的情感一样，它在我沮丧的那段时期也中断了。我曾一次次地从这里面寻求安慰，但是没有找到。趋势扭转后，我进入到恢复过程，而音乐在其中起到了促进作用，但是远不如以前那般慷慨激昂。这时，我第一次听了韦伯的《奥伯龙》，它那美妙的旋律向我展示了一种仍然容易感染我的快乐的源泉，我因而从中得到了极大的快乐，这对我很有益。然而，我觉得音乐带来的快乐（特别是这种纯粹的曲调带来的快乐)会因熟悉而减弱，需要隔一段时间再听，或者不断翻新才能保持，这种想法把音乐带给我的益处削弱了不少。音乐创作可竭尽性的想法严重地折磨着我，这既很符合我当时的状态，也很符合这段时间我的总体心境。八度音阶只有五个全音和两个半音，它们只能按照有限的几种方法组合在一起，而其中只有一小部分很美妙。并且在我看来，这一小部分中的绝大多数也一定已经被人发现了，不可能再有空间让很多人像莫扎特和韦伯一样，创造出完全清新、无比丰富的音乐来。这种焦虑的源头可能会被认为和勒普泰岛上害怕太阳会燃尽的哲学家类似。然而，它是和我性格里最好的特质联系在一起的，也是在我非常不浪漫、毫不可敬的忧虑中能找到的唯一优点。因为公正地看，我的沮丧是由于我幸福的构成遭到了毁灭，尽管这种沮丧只能被说成是任性的，然而我一直在思考人类总体的命运，并且不能把它和我的命运分开。我感觉，我人生中的缺点一定也是人生本身的瑕疵。问题在于，如果社会和政府改革家能实现他们的目标，社会上的每个人都是自由的，物质生活都是舒适的，人生中的快乐不再靠努力和艰难来维持的话，快乐是否就不再是快乐了。我觉得除非可以找到比这更好的为人类的总体幸福而努力的希望，否则我的沮丧就会继续下去；但是如果我能看到这样一条出路，我就应该愉快地看待世界。只要自己参与其中，公平地分享共同的命运，我就满意了。</td>
		<td class="en">I now began to find meaning in the things which I had read or heard about the importance of poetry and art as instruments of human culture. But it was some time longer before I began to know this by personal experience. The only one of the imaginative arts in which I had from childhood taken great pleasure, was music; the best effect of which (and in this it surpasses perhaps every other art) consists in exciting enthusiasm; in winding up to a high pitch those feelings of an elevated kind which are already in the character, but to which this excitement gives a glow and a fervour, which, though transitory at its utmost height, is precious for sustaining them at other times. This effect of music I had often experienced; but, like all my pleasurable susceptibilities, it was suspended during the gloomy period. I had sought relief again and again from this quarter, but found none. After the tide had turned, and I was in process of recovery, I had been helped forward by music, but in a much less elevated manner. I at this time first became acquainted with Weber’s Oberon, and the extreme pleasure which I drew from its delicious melodies did me good, by showing me a source of pleasure to which I was as susceptible as ever. The good, however, was much impaired by the thought, that the pleasure of music (as is quite true of such pleasure as this was, that of mere tune) fades with familiarity, and requires either to be revived by intermittence, or fed by continual novelty. And it is very characteristic both of my then state, and of the general tone of my mind at this period of my life, that I was seriously tormented by the thought of the exhaustibility of musical combinations. The octave consists only of five tones and two semitones, which can be put together in only a limited number of ways, of which but a small proportion are beautiful: most of these, it seemed to me, must have been already discovered, and there could not be room for a long succession of Mozarts and Webers, to strike out, as these had done, entirely new and surpassingly rich veins of musical beauty. This source of anxiety may, perhaps, be thought to resemble that of the philosophers of Laputa2, who feared lest the sun should be burnt out. It was, however, connected with the best feature in my character, and the only good point to be found in my very unromantic and in no way honorable distress. For though my dejection, honestly looked at, could not be called other than egotistical, produced by the ruin, as I thought, of my fabric of happiness, yet the destiny of mankind in general was ever in my thoughts, and could not be separated from my own. I felt that the flaw in my life, must be a flaw in life itself; that the question was, whether, if the reformers of society and government could succeed in their objects, and every person in the community were free and in a state of physical comfort, the pleasures of life, being no longer kept up by struggle and privation, would cease to be pleasures. And I felt that unless I could see my way to some better hope than this for human happiness in general, my dejection must continue; but that if I could see such an outlet, I should then look on the world with pleasure; content as far as I was myself concerned, with any fair share of the general lot. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的这种思想和情感状态，让第一次（1828年秋天）读华兹华斯成为我人生中非常重要的事件。我是出于好奇才开始读他的诗集的，并没期盼从它那里得到精神慰藉，虽然我之前曾是带着这种希望去读诗的。在我最沮丧的那段时期，我读了拜伦的全部作品（我当时并不熟悉），想看看一个被认为特别善于抒发强烈感情的诗人能否激起我内心的任何情感。和预想的一样，我从这种阅读中没得到任何好处，只有坏处。这位诗人的心境和我的极其相似。他的诗是消磨掉所有快乐的人的悲叹，他似乎认为，人生对于所有拥有它的美好的人来说一定很乏味无趣，就像我对人生的感觉一样。他的《哈罗尔德》和《曼弗雷德》带有和我一样的负担。以我当时的心境，也无法从他的《异教徒》的强烈感官激情中，或者《拉腊》的忧郁中得到任何安慰。拜伦完全不适合我的情形，华兹华斯却正好适合。两三年前，我浏览了《漫游》，几乎没什么收获。如果这时候读的话，很可能还是收获很少。但是1815年两卷版的诗集中各种各样的诗歌（在诗人的人生晚期，这本诗集没有受到赏识），正好是那个特殊时刻满足我精神需求的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">This state of my thoughts and feelings made the fact of my reading Wordsworth for the first time (in the autumn of 1828) an important event in my life. I took up the collection of his poems from curiosity, with no expectation of mental relief from it, though I had before resorted to poetry with that hope. In the worst period of my depression, I had read through the whole of Byron (then new to me), to try whether a poet, whose peculiar department was supposed to be that of the intenser feelings, could rouse any feeling in me. As might be expected, I got no good from this reading, but the reverse. The poet’s state of mind was too like my own. His was the lament of a man who had worn out all pleasures, and who seemed to think that life, to all who possess the good things of it, must necessarily be the vapid, uninteresting thing which I found it. His Harold and Manfred had the same burthen on them which I had; and I was not in a frame of mind to derive any comfort from the vehement sensual passion of his Giaours, or the sullenness of his Laras. But while Byron was exactly what did not suit my condition, Wordsworth was exactly what did. I had looked into The Excursion two or three years before, and found little in it; and I should probably have found as little, had I read it at this time. But the miscellaneous poems, in the two-volume edition of 1815 (to which little of value was added in the latter part of the author’s life), proved to be the precise thing for my mental wants at that particular juncture. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >首先，这些诗强有力地触动了我最强烈的一种快乐情感，即对乡村事物和自然风光的热爱。不仅我人生中的很多快乐都得益于它，就是最近我从最长时间的沮丧中解脱出来，也得益于它。在这乡村美景的力量下，我打下了欣赏华兹华斯诗歌的基础。此外，他描述的风景大部分在山间，而我年轻时曾在比利牛斯山脉旅行过，所以他描写的是我理想的自然美。但是，如果华兹华斯只是把自然风景的美丽图画呈现在我面前，那他根本就不会对我产生任何重大的影响。司各特在这上面比华兹华斯做得还要好一些，而非常普通的风景要比任何诗人更有效。华兹华斯的诗歌之所以是治疗我心情的良药，是因为它们不仅表达了外部美，还表达了内心感觉的状态以及在美的刺激下带有感情色彩的思想状态。它们似乎就是我寻求的情感陶冶。从它们那里，我似乎找到了内心喜悦、和谐和有想象力的快乐的源泉，这个源泉可以由整个人类分享。它与斗争或者瑕疵毫无联系，但是人类物质和社会环境的每次改善都能使它变得更丰富。从它们那里，我似乎得知了，当生活中所有大不幸都被排除的时候，什么会是幸福的永久源泉。在它们的影响下，我立刻感觉更好了，更高兴了。当然，即使在我们这个时代，也有比华兹华斯更伟大的诗人。但在当时，感情更深刻、更崇高的诗歌也不能像他的诗歌那样影响我。我需要有人让我感觉到宁静的思索中有真实持久的快乐。华兹华斯教会了我不仅不需要逃避人类的共同感情和共同命运，反而应对其兴趣大增。这些诗歌给我带来的快乐证明了只要有这种陶冶，最根深蒂固的分析习惯也没什么可怕的。在这些诗歌的最后，出现了著名的“颂歌”，被人错误地称为柏拉图式“不朽的暗示”。其中，除了比他平时更甜美的旋律和节奏以及常被引用的两段宏大但哲理肤浅的意象之外，我还发现他也有过和我类似的经历。他也感觉到年轻人享受人生的最初新鲜感不会持久，但是，他用现在他教我的这种方法寻求并得到了补偿。结果我慢慢地但却彻底地从我习惯性的沮丧中解脱了出来，再也没有遭受过它的折磨。我一直重视华兹华斯，主要是因为衡量了他为我所做的这些而非其内在价值。和最伟大的诗人相比，可以说他是没有诗人气质的诗人，但是他拥有从容和喜爱沉思的风格。而无诗人气质正好是需要用诗歌陶冶的气质。华兹华斯远比其他本质上更像诗人的诗人适合给予这种陶冶。</td>
		<td class="en">In the first place, these poems addressed themselves powerfully to one of the strongest of my pleasurable susceptibilities, the love of rural objects and natural scenery; to which I had been indebted not only for much of the pleasure of my life, but quite recently for relief from one of my longest relapses into depression. In this power of rural beauty over me, there was a foundation laid for taking pleasure in Wordsworth’s poetry; the more so, as his scenery lies mostly among mountains, which, owing to my early Pyrenean excursion, were my ideal of natural beauty. But Wordsworth would never have had any great effect on me, if he had merely placed before me beautiful pictures of natural scenery. Scott does this still better than Wordsworth, and a very second-rate landscape does it more effectually than any poet. What made Wordsworth’s poems a medicine for my state of mind, was that they expressed, not mere outward beauty, but states of feeling, and of thought coloured by feeling, under the excitement of beauty. They seemed to be the very culture of the feelings, which I was in quest of. In them I seemed to draw from a source of inward joy, of sympathetic and imaginative pleasure, which could be shared in by all human beings; which had no connexion with struggle or imperfection, but would be made richer by every improvement in the physical or social condition of mankind. From them I seemed to learn what would be the perennial sources of happiness, when all the greater evils of life shall have been removed. And I felt myself at once better and happier as I came under their influence. There have certainly been, even in our own age, greater poets than Wordsworth; but poetry of deeper and loftier feeling could not have done for me at that time what his did. I needed to be made to feel that there was real, permanent happiness in tranquil contemplation. Wordsworth taught me this, not only without turning away from, but with a greatly increased interest in the common feelings and common destiny of human beings. And the delight which these poems gave me, proved that with culture of this sort, there was nothing to dread from the most confirmed habit of analysis. At the conclusion of the Poems came the famous “Ode,” falsely called Platonic, “Intimations of Immortality”: in which, along with more than his usual sweetness of melody and rhythm, and along with the two passages of grand imagery but bad philosophy so often quoted, I found that he too had had similar experience to mine; that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life was not lasting; but that he had sought for compensation, and found it, in the way in which he was now teaching me to find it. The result was that I gradually, but completely, emerged from my habitual depression, and was never again subject to it. I long continued to value Wordsworth less according to his intrinsic merits, than by the measure of what he had done for me. Compared with the greatest poets, he may be said to be the poet of unpoetical natures, possessed of quiet and contemplative tastes. But unpoetical natures are precisely those which require poetic cultivation. This cultivation Wordsworth is much more fitted to give, than poets who are intrinsically far more poets than he. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样的结果是，评价华兹华斯的优点成为我第一次公开宣布新思维方式，并与我那些没经历类似变化的同伴疏远的诱因。在此类问题上，我当时最习惯和罗巴克交换意见，我劝他读华兹华斯，他起先似乎也觉得华兹华斯很值得钦佩。但是我和大多数华兹华斯的追随者一样，强烈地抵制拜伦，既反对他的诗，也反对他对人们性格的影响。相反，作为行动派和奋斗派的罗巴克非常欣赏，也特别崇拜拜伦，他认为拜伦的作品是人类生活的诗歌，而华兹华斯的作品在他看来都是关于花朵和蝴蝶的。我们同意在辩论学会公开辩论，因此我们两个晚上都在那儿讨论拜伦和华兹华斯相形之下的优点，各自背诵冗长的诗歌理论并举例来说明这些优点。斯特林也用一个精彩的演讲提出了他自己独特的理论。这是罗巴克和我在有分量的问题上第一次站在不同的立场上。从这时起，我们的分歧越来越大，尽管接下来几年我们仍是朋友。起初，我们的主要分歧在于感情熏陶。罗巴克在很多方面与边沁主义者或者功利主义者的流行看法非常不同。他很热爱诗歌以及大部分优秀艺术。他特别喜欢音乐、戏剧表演，尤其是绘画，他自己设计、描绘的风景画很流畅，很美。但是他从来都不明白这些东西对性格的形成有何等帮助。就个人而言，他不像人们想象的功利主义者那样缺乏感情，他的感情非常敏锐，非常强烈。但是，和大多数有感情的英国人一样，他发现自己的感情非常碍事。与快乐的共鸣相比，他更容易受到痛苦的共鸣的影响，因此他在别处寻找快乐，希望自己的感情变迟钝，而不是敏锐。确实，英国人的性格和英国的社会环境使得英国人基本不可能从表达共鸣中得到幸福。因此如果共鸣在英国人的人生规划中无足轻重的话也不足为奇。在大多数其他国家，共鸣作为个人幸福的要素是极为重要的，是人们都习以为常的真理，不需要任何正式的声明。但是，似乎大多数英国思想家为了使人们的行为仁慈而慈悲，都把它当作不可避免的灾祸。罗巴克就是这种英国人，或者看起来是这样。他几乎看不到任何感情熏陶的好处，完全看不到通过想象培养感情的好处，他认为这只是在培养错觉。我徒劳地劝说他，如果想法构思得生动就会激发我们富有想象力的感情，这种感情不是幻想，而是事实，像物体的任何其他性质一样真实。在我们对事物的理解中这种感情绝不意味着错误和幻想，而是与该事物所有物质的、精神的规律及关系的最精确的了解以及最完美的实践认知相一致的。对落日染红了晚霞之美的最强烈的感情，不会阻碍我知道云是水蒸气，知道它遵从所有处于悬浮状态的水蒸气的定律。我同样会一有机会就考虑这些自然规律，并依照这些规律行事，就好像我不能察觉美和丑的任何区别一样。</td>
		<td class="en">It so fell out that the merits of Wordsworth were the occasion of my first public declaration of my new way of thinking, and separation from those of my habitual companions who had not undergone a similar change. The person with whom at that time I was most in the habit of comparing notes on such subjects was Roebuck, and I induced him to read Wordsworth, in whom he also at first seemed to find much to admire: but I, like most Wordsworthians, threw myself into strong antagonism to Byron, both as a poet and as to his influence on the character. Roebuck, all whose instincts were those of action and struggle, had, on the contrary, a strong relish and great admiration of Byron, whose writings he regarded as the poetry of human life, while Wordsworth’s, according to him, was that of flowers and butterflies. We agreed to have the fight out at our Debating Society, where we accordingly discussed for two evenings the comparative merits of Byron and Wordsworth, propounding and illustrating by long recitations our respective theories of poetry: Sterling also, in a brilliant speech, putting forward his particular theory. This was the first debate on any weighty subject in which Reobuck and I had been on opposite sides. The schism between us widened from this time more and more, though we continued for some years longer to be companions. In the beginning, our chief divergence related to the cultivation of the feelings. Roebuck was in many respects very different from the vulgar notion of a Benthamite or Utilitarian. He was a lover of poetry and of most of the fine arts. He took great pleasure in music, in dramatic performances, especially in painting, and himself drew and designed landscapes with great facility and beauty. But he never could be made to see that these things have any value as aids in the formation of character. Personally, instead of being, as Benthamites are supposed to be, avoid of feeling, he had very quick and strong sensibilities. But, like most Englishmen who have feelings, he found his feelings stand very much in his way. He was much more susceptible to the painful sympathies than to the pleasurable, and looking for his happiness elsewhere, he wished that his feelings should be deadened rather than quickened. And, in truth, the English character, and English social circumstances, make it so seldom possible to derive happiness from the exercise of the sympathies, that it is not wonderful if they count for little in an Englishman’s scheme of life. In most other countries the paramount importance of the sympathies as a constituent of individual happiness is an axiom, taken for granted rather than needing any formal statement; but most English thinkers almost seem to regard them as necessary evils, required for keeping men’s actions benevolent and compassionate. Roebuck was, or appeared to be, this kind of Englishman. He saw little good in any cultivation of the feelings, and none at all in cultivating them through the imagination, which he thought was only cultivating illusions. It was in vain I urged on him that the imaginative emotion which an idea, when vividly conceived, excites in us, is not an illusion but a fact, as real as any of the other qualities of objects; and far from implying anything erroneous and delusive in our mental apprehension of the object, is quite consistent with the most accurate knowledge and most perfect practical recognition of all its physical and intellectual laws and relations. The intensest feeling of the beauty of a cloud lighted by the setting sun, is no hindrance to my knowing that the cloud is vapour of water, subject to all the laws of vapours in a state of suspension; and I am just as likely to allow for, and act on, these physical laws whenever there is occasion to do so, as if I had been incapable of perceiving any distinction between beauty and ugliness. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我和罗巴克越来越疏远了，却开始和协会里面我们柯尔律治派的对手——弗雷德里克·莫里斯和约翰·斯特林——走得越来越近，两人后来都很出名，前者是由于他的著作，后者是由于黑尔和卡莱尔给他写的传记。这两个朋友中，莫里斯是位思想家，而斯特林是位演说家，还是热情洋溢的思想评论员，当时他阐述的思想几乎全都是莫里斯为他塑造的。有一阵子我曾通过艾顿·图克与莫里斯相识（他们俩是在剑桥认识的），尽管我和他之间的讨论几乎总是争论，但我还是从中得到很多东西，帮助构建我的新思想，就像我那些年读柯尔律治、歌德和其他德国作家的著作受益很多一样。我非常尊敬莫里斯的品格和意志，还有他伟大的智力天赋，与我很乐意能给予他的称赞相比，如果我说了些可能不足以显示他的杰出的话，那也不是我情愿的。但我总觉得，莫里斯比我任何同辈人浪费的智力都要多。当然，也几乎没人有那么多可以浪费的智力。他有强大的概括能力，罕见的独创性和辨别能力，能广泛地领悟重要却不明显的真理，但他没有用来在伟大的思想主题上提出更好的东西，以代替大量无价值的陈腐观点，而是用来向自己证明，英国国教从一开始就什么都知道，那些真理——教会和正统观念因它们而受到攻击（其中有很多他和别人看得一样清楚）——不仅和三十九信条一致，而且在这些条款中这些真理被理解和阐释得比任何反对它们的人做得都好。对此我从来都没能找到任何其他解释，除了把它归因于良心上的胆怯和性格上的天生敏感，这经常迫使天赋极高的人接受天主教，因为与他们从自己的判断得出的独立结论相比，他们需要更稳固的支持。任何认识莫里斯的人，都永远不会想要把更庸俗的胆怯归咎于他，即使他没有通过采取和一些通常被认为正统的观点最终爆发冲突，并发起高尚的基督教社会主义运动的手段以此向公众证明自己没有这种胆怯。从精神角度来看，与他最类似的人物是柯尔律治，不去看诗歌天赋，仅从智力上讲的话，我想他明显比柯尔律治更出众。然而这时，他可能会被描述为柯尔律治的追随者，而斯特林则被描述为柯尔律治和他的追随者。我的旧观点正在经历的改变给了我一些与他们接触的机会。莫里斯和斯特林两人都对我的发展起到了重要作用。我和斯特林很快就成了密友，我对他比曾经对任何人都更加热爱。他确实是个非常可爱的人。他性格坦率，热忱，深情又开朗。热爱显现于最高尚和最平凡东西中的真理。他的性情慷慨大方，热情洋溢，这也给他所采纳的观点染上了冲动的色彩，但是正如他会向他认为的对方的错误开战一样，他也能公平地对待所反对的学说和人，他给予自由和义务这两个基本点同样的热爱，他结合了这么多优秀品质，不仅吸引了我，还吸引了所有像我一样了解他的人。他思想开明，胸襟开阔，因此超越了当时我们观点之间的巨大分歧，并和我成为朋友，他一点都不觉得困难。他告诉我他和别人是怎么看我的（道听途说的消息），他们觉得我是“人造的”或机器制造的人，身上刻着别人的观点，而我只能机械地复制。但当他和我讨论华兹华斯和拜伦的时候，发现华兹华斯以及这个名字意味着的一切像属于他和他的朋友一样也“属于”我时，他的感情发生了多大的变化啊。健康的衰退很快打碎了他所有的人生规划，迫使他住到离伦敦较远的地方，因此，在我们认识了一两年之后，我们只能间隔很长时间才能见一次面了。但是（就像他在给卡莱尔的某封信中说的），我们见面的时候就像兄弟一样。尽管他从来都不是一个造诣很深的思想家（从思想家这个词的完整意义来讲），但他思想开阔，而且在勇气上远远超过莫里斯，这让他超越了莫里斯和柯尔律治对他智力上的支配。尽管他直到最后还保持着对这两个人强烈但有判断的崇拜，尤其是对莫里斯是种热烈的喜爱。在他的一生中，除了那一段很短暂的时间他错误地成为牧师之外，他的思想一直都在进步，每次在间隔一段时间后见到他时，他似乎总能让我看到这种进步，这让我把歌德评价席勒的话用在他身上，“他的进步真的是突飞猛进”。我和他认识的时候，两人思想上的距离几乎像两极一样远，但是我们之间的距离总是在缩小。我向着他的某些观点靠近了，他在自己短暂的一生中，也经常越来越接近我的好几个观点。如果他还活着，健康和精力还允许他不断地刻苦自学的话，真不知道这种自然的同化会进行到什么程度。</td>
		<td class="en">While my intimacy with Roebuck diminished, I fell more and more into friendly intercourse with our Coleridgian adversaries in the Society, Frederick Maurice and John Sterling, both subsequently so well known, the former by his writings, the latter through the biographies by Hare and Carlyle. Of these two friends, Maurice was the thinker, Sterling the orator, and impassioned expositor of thoughts which, at this period, were almost entirely formed for him by Maurice. With Maurice I had for some time been acquainted through Eyton Tooke, who had known him at Cambridge, and although my discussions with him were almost always disputes, I had carried away from them much that helped to build up my new fabric of thought, in the same way as I was deriving much from Coleridge, and from the writings of Goethe and other German authors which I read during these years. I have so deep a respect for Maurice’s character and purposes, as well as for his great mental gifts, that it is with some unwillingness I say anything which may seem to place him on a less high eminence than I would gladly be able to accord to him. But I have always thought that there was more intellectual power wasted in Maurice than in any other of my cotemporaries. Few of them certainly have had so much to waste. Great powers of generalization, rare ingenuity and subtlety, and a wide perception of important and unobvious truths, served him not for putting something better into the place of the worthless heap of received opinions on the great subjects of thought, but for proving to his own mind that the Church of England had known everything from the first, and that all the truths on the ground of which the Church and orthodoxy have been attacked (many of which he saw as clearly as any one) are not only consistent with the Thirty-nine Articles3, but are better understood and expressed in those Articles than by any one who rejects them. I have never been able to find any other explanation of this, than by attributing it to that timidity of conscience, combined with original sensitiveness of temperament, which has so often driven highly gifted men into Romanism from the need of a firmer support than they can find in the independent conclusions of their own judgment. Any more vulgar kind of timidity no one who knew Maurice would ever think of imputing to him, even if he had not given public proof of his freedom from it, by his ultimate collision with some of the opinions commonly regarded as orthodox, and by his noble origination of the Christian Socialist movement. The nearest parallel to him, in a moral point of view, is Coleridge, to whom, in merely intellectual power, apart from poetical genius, I think him decidedly superior. At this time, however, he might be described as a disciple of Coleridge, and Sterling as a disciple of Coleridge and of him. The modifications which were taking place in my old opinions gave me some points of contact with them; and both Maurice and Sterling were of considerable use to my development. With Sterling I soon became very intimate, and was more attached to him than I have ever been to any other man. He was indeed one of the most loveable of men. His frank, cordial, affectionate, and expansive character; a love of truth alike conspicuous in the highest things and the humblest; a generous and ardent nature which threw itself with impetuosity into the opinions it adopted, but was as eager to do justice to the doctrines and the men it was opposed to, as to make war on what it thought their errors; and an equal devotion to the two cardinal points of Liberty and Duty, formed a combination of qualities as attractive to me, as to all others who knew him as well as I did. With his open mind and heart, he found no difficulty in joining hands with me across the gulf which as yet divided our opinions. He told me how he and others had looked upon me (from hearsay information), as a “made” or manufactured man, having had a certain impress of opinion stamped on me which I could only reproduce; and what a change took place in his feelings when he found, in the discussion on Wordsworth and Byron, that Wordsworth, and all which that name implies, “belonged” to me as much as to him and his friends. The failure of his health soon scattered all his plans of life, and compelled him to live at a distance from London, so that after the first year or two of our acquaintance, we only saw each other at distant intervals. But (as he said himself in one of his letters to Carlyle) when we did meet it was like brothers. Though he was never, in the full sense of the word, a profound thinker, his openness of mind, and the moral courage in which he greatly surpassed Maurice, made him outgrow the dominion which Maurice and Coleridge had once exercised over his intellect; though he retained to the last a great but discriminating admiration of both, and towards Maurice a warm affection. Except in that short and transitory phase of his life, during which he made the mistake of becoming a clergyman, his mind was ever progressive: and the advance he always seemed to have made when I saw him after an interval, made me apply to him what Goethe said of Schiller, “er hatte eine fürchtliche Fortschreitung.” He and I started from intellectual points almost as wide apart as the poles, but the distance between us was always diminishing: if I made steps towards some of his opinions, he, during his short life, was constantly approximating more and more to several of mine: and if he had lived, and had health and vigour to prosecute his ever assiduous self-culture, there is no knowing how much further this spontaneous assimilation might have proceeded. </td></tr>

I never, in the course of my transition, was content to remain, for ever so short a time, confused and unsettled. When I had taken in any new idea, I could not rest till I had adjusted its relation to my old opinions, and ascertained exactly how far its effect ought to extend in modifying or superseding them. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在为边沁和我父亲著作中的政府理论辩护时我经常必须面对的一些冲突，以及对其他政治思想学派的了解，使我意识到那个自称政府概论的学说本应腾出空间说明但却没有说明的很多事情。但是到那时为止，我仍然认为这些事情是把理论应用于实践时要作的修正，而不是理论本身的缺陷。我觉得，政治学不应该是特定经验的科学。有人谴责功利主义理论不是44理论，谴责它用一般性的推理得出理论，而不用培根的实验方法，这显示了他们完全不了解培根原则和实证研究的必要条件。在这个当口上，《爱丁堡评论》上发表了麦考利攻击我父亲《论政府》的著名文章。这件事让我思考了很多。我知道麦考利的政治学逻辑的观念是错误的，他支持用经验主义的方法对待政治现象，反对用哲学方法；甚至在自然科学上，他的哲学探讨观念可能和开普勒的一致，但会排除牛顿和拉普拉斯。然而我还是感觉到，尽管他的语气不得体（后来作者对这个错误作了非常充分、可敬的改正），但是他在这个问题上对父亲的好几处责难还是有道理的。父亲的前提的确太狭窄了，只包含了政治学中的重要结论所依据的一小部分普遍真理。统治集团和整个社会的利益一致，在任何实际意义上，都不是善政依赖的唯一条件。这种利益一致也不能仅通过选举制度得到确保。我根本不满意父亲处理麦考利的批评的方式。他没有像我想象的那样，通过说“我不是在写一篇政治学的学术论文，我是在为议会改革作论证”来证明自己是正确的。他认为麦考利的论证完全不合理，是对推理才能的攻击，也例证了霍布斯的一句名言：当理性无视人的时候，人也会无视理性。这让我觉得，与我先前认为的相比，父亲的哲学方法观念应用在政治学上确实存在更根本性的错误。但是起初，我并没有看清楚错误可能是什么。最后，我在学习其他东西的时候忽然想起来了。1830年初，我开始把逻辑学的一些观点写下来（主要是术语区分和命题意义），都是在之前提到的上午交谈中提出来的，有一部分也是那时解决的。确保这些想法没有丢失之后，我继续努力探索这个主题的其他部分，试试看能不能更进一步全面地整理逻辑学的理论。我立刻抓住归纳法这个问题，暂时搁置推理问题，因为我们必须先获得前提，然后才能从前提进行推理。目前，归纳法主要是寻找导致结果的原因的过程。在试图弄清楚自然科学中追踪原因和结果的方法时我很快发现，在更完善的科学中我们通过对特殊性的概括，形成了逐一考虑原因的趋势，然后从那些单独的可能性向下推论，找出同样的原因结合起来引起的结果。然后，我问自己，这个推论过程的最终分析是什么？普通的三段论的理论显然没有给出解释。我的做法（从霍布斯和我父亲那里学的）是用我能找到的最好的具体例子，学习抽象的原理，我想起来动力学里的力的合成对我正在研究的逻辑过程来说是最完美的例子。因此，我去研究大脑在应用力的合成原理的时候究竟在做什么，结果发现它只是在进行简单的加法。它把一种力量的单独作用加在另一种力量的单独作用上。但是，这个过程合理吗？在动力学以及物理学的所有精确分支里面，是合理的。但是在其他一些情况下，比如化学，就不合理了。那时我回想起来，在我小时候最喜欢的书——汤姆森《化学系统》的引言中，提到过跟这个类似的情况，并指出这是化学现象和机械现象的一个区别。这个区别立刻让我弄清了政治哲学中让我困惑的是什么东西。我现在明白了，一门科学要么是演绎的，要么是实证的，这取决于其所涉及的领域中，各种原因联合造成的结果和分开造成结果的简单相加是否相同。因此，政治学一定是门演绎的科学。这样看来，麦考利和我父亲都错了。前者把政治学中哲学探讨的方法等同于化学中纯粹的实验方法，而后者尽管采用演绎法是对的，但是选择了错误的演绎法，没有采用适当的自然哲学的演绎法分支，而是选择不适当的纯粹几何学的演绎法分支，这根本就不是因果关系的科学，不需要也不容许对结果作任何概括。这为我后来出版的《论伦理学的逻辑》一书中的主要章节打下了思想基础。我对自己的旧政治信条的新立场现在也非常明确了。</td>
		<td class="en">The conflicts which I had so often had to sustain in defending the theory of government laid down in Bentham’s and my father’s writings, and the acquaintance I had obtained with other schools of political thinking, made me aware of many things which that doctrine, professing to be a theory of government in general, ought to have made room for, and did not. But these things, as yet, remained with me rather as corrections to be made in applying the theory to practice, than as defects in the theory. I felt that politics could not be a science of specific experience; and that the accusations against the Benthamic theory of being a theory, of proceeding à priori by way of general reasoning, instead of Baconian experiment, shewed complete ignorance of Bacon’s principles, and of the necessary conditions of experimental investigation. At this juncture appeared in the Edinburgh Review, Macaulay’s famous attack on my father’s Essay on Government. This gave me much to think about. I saw that Macaulay’s conception of the logic of politics was erroneous; that he stood up for the empirical mode of treating political phenomena, against the philosophical; that even in physical science, his notion of philosophizing might have recognized Kepler4, but would have excluded Newton and Laplace5. But I could not help feeling, that though the tone was unbecoming (an error for which the writer, at a later period, made the most ample and honorable amends), there was truth in several of his strictures on my father’s treatment of the subject; that my father’s premises were really too narrow, and included but a small number of the general truths, on which, in politics, the important consequences depend. Identity of interest between the governing body and the community at large, is not, in any practical sense which can be attached to it, the only thing on which good government depends; neither can this identity of interest be secured by the mere conditions of election. I was not at all satisfied with the mode in which my father met the criticisms of Macaulay. He did not, as I thought he ought to have done, justify himself by saying, “I was not writing a scientific treatise on politics. I was writing an argument for parliamentary reform.” He treated Macaulay’s argument as simply irrational; an attack upon the reasoning faculty; an example of the saying of Hobbes, that when reason is against a man, a man will be against reason. This made me think that there was really something more fundamentally erroneous in my father’s conception of philosophical method, as applicable to politics, than I had hitherto supposed there was. But I did not at first see clearly what the error might be. At last it flashed upon me all at once in the course of other studies. In the early part of 1830 I had begun to put on paper the ideas on Logic (chiefly on the distinctions among Terms, and the import of Propositions) which had been suggested and in part worked out in the morning conversations already spoken of. Having secured these thoughts from being lost, I pushed on into the other parts of the subject, to try whether I could do anything further towards clearing up the theory of Logic generally. I grappled at once with the problem of Induction, postponing that of Reasoning, on the ground that it is necessary to obtain premises before we can reason from them. Now, Induction is mainly a process for finding the causes of effects: and in attempting to fathom the mode of tracing causes and effects in physical science, I soon saw that in the more perfect of the sciences, we ascend, by generalization from particulars, to the tendencies of causes considered singly, and then reason downward from those separate tendencies, to the effect of the same causes when combined. I then asked myself, what is the ultimate analysis of this deductive process; the common theory of the syllogism evidently throwing no light upon it. My practice (learnt from Hobbes and my father) being to study abstract principles by means of the best concrete instances I could find, the Composition of Forces, in dynamics, occurred to me as the most complete example of the logical process I was investigating. On examining, accordingly, what the mind does when it applies the principle of the Composition of Forces, I found that it performs a simple act of addition. It adds the separate effect of the one force to the separate effect of the other, and puts down the sum of these separate effects as the joint effect. But is this a legitimate process? In dynamics, and in all the mathematical branches of physics, it is; but in some other cases, as in chemistry, it is not; and I then recollected that something not unlike this was pointed out as one of the distinctions between chemical and mechanical phenomena, in the introduction to that favorite of my boyhood, Thomson’s System of Chemistry. This distinction at once made my mind clear as to what was perplexing me in respect to the philosophy of politics. I now saw, that a science is either deductive or experimental, according as, in the province it deals with, the effects of causes when conjoined, are or are not the sums of the effects which the same causes produce when separate. It followed that politics must be a deductive science. It thus appeared, that both Macaulay and my father were wrong; the one in assimilating the method of philosophizing in politics to the purely experimental method of chemistry; while the other, though right in adopting a deductive method, had made a wrong selection of one, having taken as the type of deduction, not the appropriate process, that of the deductive branches of natural philosophy, but the inappropriate one of pure geometry, which, not being a science of causation at all, does not require or admit of any summing-up of effects. A foundation was thus laid in my thoughts for the principal chapters of what I afterwards published On the Logic of the Moral Sciences; and my new position in respect to my old political creed, now became perfectly definite. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果问我用哪种政治哲学体系代替了已经放弃的哲学，我的回答是没有体系，只是一个信念，相信真正的体系远比我之前知道的更复杂，更多面，它的职责在于提供原则，从这些原则中可以推导出适合任何特定环境的制度，而不是提供一套模范制度。欧洲思想的影响，更确切地说是欧洲大陆思想的影响，尤其是那些19世纪反抗18世纪的思想，现在正在向我涌过来。这些思想来自各个方向：柯尔律治，我甚至在信念改变前就开始兴致勃勃地读他的作品了；与我有私交的柯尔律治派的人；我读过的歌德的作品；卡莱尔在《爱丁堡评论》和《外国评论》上的早期文章，尽管很长时间以来，我在这些文章中除了愚蠢的狂言什么都没看到（我父亲到最后也什么都没看到）。从这些思想来源以及当时我一直熟读的法国文学中，我得出一些看法，它们的重要性由于欧洲思想家的观点被完全颠倒而显现出来，尤其是以下这些：人类大脑对可能的进步有种秩序，在这种秩序之内，有些事情必须先于另一些事情，这种秩序可以由政府和公众指导人员进行一定的修改，但修改是有限度的。政治体制的所有问题都是相对的，不是绝对的，人类进步的不同阶段不仅会有而且应该有不同的体制。政府要么就在社会上最强大的力量手里，要么就会传递到它的手里，至于那个力量是什么，不取决于制度，制度反而要取决于它。任何广义的政治理论或政治哲学都假定先前有一个人类进步的理论，这和历史哲学是一样的。这些大体上正确的观点被现在经常和我交换意见的思想家们以夸张、曲解的方式所持有，并且他们像一般的保守派一样，忽视了18世纪的思想家看到的那一半事实。尽管我在进步的某段时期也有一阵子低估了那个伟大的世纪，但是我从来没有参与过反对它，而是像对待真理的那一面一样，紧紧坚持真理的这一面。19世纪和18世纪之间的斗争让我想起盾牌的战争，它一面是黑的，一面是白的。我惊讶于战士们互相猛攻时所带有的盲目愤怒。我把柯尔律治很多关于半真理的名言用在他们身上，以及柯尔律治本人身上。我此时最愿意把歌德的“多面性”策略当成我自己的策略。</td>
		<td class="en">If I am asked what system of political philosophy I substituted for that which, as a philosophy, I had abandoned, I answer, No system: only a conviction that the true system was something much more complex and many-sided than I had previously had any idea of, and that its office was to supply, not a set of model institutions, but principles from which the institutions suitable to any given circumstances might be deduced. The influences of European, that is to say, Continental, thought, and especially those of the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth, were now streaming in upon me. They came from various quarters: from the writings of Coleridge, which I had begun to read with interest even before the change in my opinions; from the Coleridgians with whom I was in personal intercourse; from what I had read of Goethe; from Carlyle’s early articles in the Edinburgh and Foreign Reviews, though for a long time I saw nothing in these (as my father saw nothing in them to the last) but insane rhapsody. From these sources, and from the acquaintance I kept up with the French literature of the time, I derived, among other ideas which the general turning upside down of the opinions of European thinkers had brought uppermost, these in particular: That the human mind has a certain order of possible progress, in which some things must precede others, an order which governments and public instructors can modify to some, but not to an unlimited extent: That all questions of political institutions are relative, not absolute, and that different stages of human progress not only will have, but ought to have, different institutions: that government is always either in the hands, or passing into the hands, of whatever is the strongest power in society, and that what this power is, does not depend on institutions, but institutions on it: that any general theory or philosophy of politics supposes a previous theory of human progress, and that this is the same thing with a philosophy of history. These opinions, true in the main, were held in an exaggerated and violent manner by the thinkers with whom I was now most accustomed to compare notes, and who, as usual with a reaction, ignored that half of the truth which the thinkers of the eighteenth century saw. But though, at one period of my progress, I for some time undervalued that great century, I never joined in the reaction against it, but kept as firm hold of one side of the truth as I took of the other. The fight between the nineteenth century and the eighteenth always reminded me of the battle about the shield, one side of which was white and the other black. I marvelled at the blind rage with which the combatants rushed against one another. I applied to them, and to Coleridge himself, many of Coleridge’s sayings about half truths; and Goethe’s device, “many-sidedness,” was one which I would most willingly, at this period, have taken for mine. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >与其他作家相比，最能使我认识到一个新政治思考方式的作家，是法国的圣西门学派。1829年和1830年，我了解了他们的一些作品。当时，他们还处于思索的初期阶段。他们还没有把自己的哲学装扮成一种信仰，也没有构思社会主义方案。他们只是刚开始质疑世袭财产的原则。我绝对没有准备追随他们，即便只是到这种程度。但是他们第一次呈现给我人类进步自然顺序的连贯观点，给我留下了深刻的印象。尤其是他们把所有历史划分成建制时代和批判时代。在建制时代，（他们说）人类深信不疑地接受一些积极的信条，为他们的所有活动寻求权力，并或多或少地容纳真理和调整以适应人类的需求。在这一信条的影响下，他们实现了和信条兼容的所有进步，并最终舍弃了它。这时，另一个充满批判和否定的时代来临了，在这个时代，人们失去了他们旧的信念，而没有获得任何新的、全面的或权威的信念，只是坚信旧的是错的。希腊和罗马多神教的时代，在受过教育的希腊和罗马人真正信仰它的时间内是个建制时代，接下来是希腊哲学家的批判或怀疑时代。另一个建制时代是应基督教而生的。相应的批判时代从宗教改革开始，从那时起一直持续到现在，在一个新的建制时代以更先进的信条取胜开始之前，这一时代不会完全停止。我知道这些观点并非独属于圣西门学派；相反，它们是整个欧洲的财富，或者至少是德国和法国的。但是就我所知，从来没有人像这些作家那样把它们全面系统化，也没有人像他们一样强有力地提出批判时代的显著特征。因为那时，我还没读过菲希特的演说集《当代特征》。我确实发现卡莱尔激烈地谴责“无信仰的时代”和如今这样一个时代，我和当时的大多数人一样，认为这一时代是支持旧的信仰模式激昂的抗议。但是这些谴责中所有正确的东西，我认为圣西门学派的人陈述得更冷静，更有哲理性。在他们的出版物中，我也发现有一本远比其他的更出众。在这本书里面，总体的观点被展开得更明确，更有启发性。这就是奥古斯特·孔德早期的一个作品，他当时称自己是圣西门的弟子，甚至在扉页上公开这样宣布。在这个小册子里，孔德先生首次提出了他后来加以详细阐述的学说，即人类知识的每个领域都有三个阶段的自然演替——首先是神学的，接下来是形而上学的，最后是实证的阶段。他主张社会科学也必须受相同规律的支配。封建制度和天主教制度是社会科学神学状态的最后阶段，新教是形而上学阶段的开始，法国大革命的理论是它的结束，但实证阶段尚未到来。这个学说和我现有的观念很一致，似乎还显示出了科学性。我已经认为自然科学的方法是政治学的合适模型。但是，这时我从圣西门学派和孔德提出的一连串思考中得到的主要益处是，我比以往任何时候都更清楚地了解了一个过渡时代的特征，不再把这样一个时代的道德和思维特征误认为是人类的正常属性。透过当代喧哗的争论和通常很软弱的信念，我期望未来会结合批判时代和建制时代最好的特性：思想上无拘无束的自由，以及在不损害别人的情况下，个人所有行为方式的极大自由。但是，关于什么是对的，什么是错的，什么是有益的，以及什么是有害的信念，已经通过早期教育和一致的情感深深地铭刻在了感觉之上，并稳固地植根于理智和人生的真正需求中，它们不会像以前和现在所有的宗教、伦理和政治信条一样，需要定期地被抛弃和取而代之。</td>
		<td class="en">The writers by whom, more than by any others, a new mode of political thinking was brought home to me, were those of the St. Simonian school in France. In 1829 and 1830 I became acquainted with some of their writings. They were then only in the earlier stages of their speculations. They had not yet dressed out their philosophy as a religion, nor had they organized their scheme of Socialism. They were just beginning to question the principle of hereditary property. I was by no means prepared to go with them even this length; but I was greatly struck with the connected view which they for the first time presented to me, of the natural order of human progress; and especially with their division of all history into organic periods and critical periods. During the organic periods (they said) mankind accept with firm conviction some positive creed, claiming jurisdiction over all their actions, and containing more or less of truth and adaptation to the needs of humanity. Under its influence they make all the progress compatible with the creed, and finally outgrow it; when a period follows of criticism and negation, in which mankind lose their old convictions without acquiring any new ones, of a general or authoritative character, except the conviction that the old are false. The period of Greek and Roman polytheism, so long as really believed in by instructed Greeks and Romans, was an organic period, succeeded by the critical or sceptical period of the Greek philosophers. Another organic period came in with Christianity. The corresponding critical period began with the Reformation6, has lasted ever since, still lasts, and cannot altogether cease until a new organic period has been inaugurated by the triumph of a yet more advanced creed. These ideas, I knew, were not peculiar to the St. Simonians; on the contrary, they were the general property of Europe, or at least of Germany and France, but they had never, to my knowledge, been so completely systematized as by these writers, nor the distinguishing characteristics of a critical period so powerfully set forth; for I was not then acquainted with Fichte7’s Lectures on The Characteristics of the Present Age. In Carlyle, indeed, I found bitter denunciations of an “age of unbelief,” and of the present age as such, which I, like most people at that time, supposed to be passionate protests in favour of the old modes of belief. But all that was true in these denunciations, I thought that I found more calmly and philosophically stated by the St. Simonians. Among their publications, too, there was one which seemed to me far superior to the rest; in which the general idea was matured into something much more definite and instructive. This was an early work of Auguste Comte8, who then called himself, and even announced himself in the title-page as, a pupil of Saint Simon. In this tract M. Comte first put forth the doctrine, which he afterwards so copiously illustrated, of the natural succession of three stages in every department of human knowledge: first, the theological, next the metaphysical, and lastly, the positive stage; and contended, that social science must be subject to the same law; that the feudal and Catholic system was the concluding phase of the theological state of the social science, Protestantism the commencement, and the doctrines of the French Revolution the consummation, of the metaphysical; and that its positive state was yet to come. This doctrine harmonized well with my existing notions, to which it seemed to give a scientific shape. I already regarded the methods of physical science as the proper models for political. But the chief benefit which I derived at this time from the trains of thought suggested by the St. Simonians and by Comte, was, that I obtained a clearer conception than ever before of the peculiarities of an era of transition in opinion, and ceased to mistake the moral and intellectual characteristics of such an era, for the normal attributes of humanity. I looked forward, through the present age of loud disputes but generally weak convictions, to a future which shall unite the best qualities of the critical with the best qualities of the organic periods: unchecked liberty of thought, unbounded freedom of individual action in all modes not hurtful to others; but also, convictions as to what is right and wrong, useful and pernicious, deeply engraven on the feelings by early education and general unanimity of sentiment, and so firmly grounded in reason and in the true exigencies of life, that they shall not, like all former and present creeds, religious, ethical, and political, require to be periodically thrown off and replaced by others. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >孔德先生很快离开了圣西门学派，有许多年我都没有看到他和他的作品。但是我继续与圣西门学派的人交朋友。他们的一个最热情的拥护者，古斯塔夫·艾希塔尔先生，一直在告知我他们的进展，他当时在英国呆了挺长一段时间。1830年，他把我介绍给他们的领袖巴扎尔和昂方坦。只要他们持续公开发表教义，继续宣传改变宗教信仰，我就会读他们写的几乎所有东西。在我看来，他们对自由主义普遍理论的批评有很多是重要的实情。部分由于他们的作品，我注意到旧的政治经济学价值非常有限，只是暂时性的，它把私有制和继承看成不能废止的事实，把生产和交换自由看成社会进步的灵丹妙药。圣西门学派逐渐阐明的方案是这样的：社会上的劳动力和资本的管理将着眼于社会的整体利益，每一个人都必须分担一定量的劳动，不管是思想家、教师、艺术家，还是生产者，都按照他们的能力分类，按照劳动量分发报酬，在我看来这个方案远比欧文对社会主义的描述更出众。在我看来，他们的目标可取，合理，尽管他们的方法可能不灵。虽然我既不相信他们的社会机器的实用性，也不相信它能有利地运转，但我觉得，宣布这样一个理想的人类社会往往会为努力促使目前这样一种构建的社会更接近某种理想标准的人指明一个有益的方向。我最尊敬他们的地方，正是别人贬低他们的地方——勇敢、毫无偏见地对待家庭问题，家庭问题是最重要的问题，在所有伟大的社会制度中都需要比目前有更多重大的改变，但是几乎没有任何改革家敢于触碰这个问题。在宣布男女完全平等，宣布他们彼此之间关系的全新秩序上，圣西门学派和欧文、傅立叶一样，有资格被后人感激和记住。</td>
		<td class="en">M. Comte soon left the St. Simonians, and I lost sight of him and his writings for a number of years. But the St. Simonians I continued to cultivate. I was kept au courant of their progress by one of their most enthusiastic disciples, M. Gustave d’Eichthal, who about that time passed a considerable interval in England. I was introduced to their chiefs, Bazard and Enfantin, in 1830; and as long as their public teachings and proselytism continued, I read nearly everything they wrote. Their criticism on the common doctrines of Liberalism seemed to me full of important truth; and it was partly by their writings that my eyes were opened to the very limited and temporary value of the old political economy, which assumes private property and inheritance as indefeasible facts, and freedom of production and exchange as the dernier mot of social improvement. The scheme gradually unfolded by the St. Simonians, under which the labour and capital of society would be managed for the general account of the community, every individual being required to take a share of labour, either as thinker, teacher, artist, or producer, all being classed according to their capacity, and remunerated according to their works, appeared to me a far superior description of Socialism to Owen’s. Their aim seemed to me desirable and rational, however their means might be inefficacious; and though I neither believed in the practicability, nor in the beneficial operation of their social machinery, I felt that the proclamation of such an ideal of human society could not but tend to give a beneficial direction to the efforts of others to bring society, as at present constituted, nearer to some ideal standard. I honoured them most of all for what they have been most cried down for—the boldness and freedom from prejudice with which they treated the subject of family, the most important of any, and needing more fundamental alterations than remain to be made in any other great social institution, but on which scarcely any reformer has the courage to touch. In proclaiming the perfect equality of men and women, and an entirely new order of things in regard to their relations with one another, the St. Simonians, in common with Owen and Fourier, have entitled themselves to the grateful remembrance of future generations. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >叙述我这段时间的生活的时候，我只详细说明了一些新感想，在那以后，这些感想在我看来都是我思考方式确切进步的转折点。但是，在那几年过渡期里，我思考了许多问题，仅选择这么几点，对我的思考量说明得非常不充分。确实，这些思考的很大一部分在于重新发现众所周知的东西，而它们也是我之前怀疑或者忽略的东西。但是，这种重新发现对我来说是种新发现，让我完整地拥有真理，不是传统的陈腔滥调，而是从头到尾全新的真理。而且，这种发现几乎总能给真理带来一些新的角度，通过这种角度，新真理与我早期观念中不广为人知的真理达成一致，并似乎在修改它们的时候肯定了它们，而对这些早期观念中的真理的重要部分，我在任何时候都没动摇过。我所有的新思考只是把这些真理的基础打得更深，更牢固，同时还经常移除贬低它们作用的观点里的误会和混乱。例如，后来在我的沮丧几次复发时，所谓的哲学必然性的理论像梦魇一样压在我的生活中。我觉得自己好像被科学地证明了就是先前环境下无助的奴隶；好像我和其他所有人的性格都是我们控制不了的力量塑造的，完全在我们的掌控能力之外。我经常对自己说，如果我能不相信环境决定性格这一学说的话，将是多么大的安慰啊。我想起福克斯对抵抗政府学说的愿望，即希望它永远不要被国王忘记，也不要被臣民记住，我说如果所有人都相信必然性理论只适用于别人的性格，而不相信也适用于他们自己的性格的话，将是件幸事。我苦苦思索这个问题，终于慢慢从里面看到了眉目。我意识到，必然性这个词，作为应用于人类行为上因果学说的名称，带有使人误解的联想，这个联想就是我以前经历的沮丧和无助的原因。我明白了，尽管我们的性格是环境决定的，但是我们自身的渴望能在很大程度上影响那些环境。自由意志学说里真正令人振奋和崇高的地方，在于坚信在自己性格的塑造上我们有真正的控制力。坚信通过影响周围的一些环境，我们的意志能改变我们未来的习惯或能力。所有这一切都和环境学说完全一致，或者说就是环境学说，只是这次得到了正确的理解。从那时起，我在自己脑海里清晰地区分了环境学说和宿命论；完全抛弃了必要性这个易误解的词。我现在第一次正确理解了这个理论，它不再令人沮丧，除了我的精神痛苦减轻了之外，我也不用再承受认为一个学说是正确的，而相反的学说也对精神有益这个重担之苦，这个担子对于一个志在成为思想改革家的人来说是那么的沉重。把我从这个两难困境中解脱出来的思路，在我看来，在之后的那些年，也适合为其他人提供相似的服务。现在，它成了我的《逻辑学体系》尾卷中“论自由和必然性”那一章。</td>
		<td class="en">In giving an account of this period of my life, I have only specified such of my new impressions as appeared to me, both at the time and since, to be a kind of turning points, marking a definite progress in my mode of thought. But these few selected points give a very insufficient idea of the quantity of thinking which I carried on respecting a host of subjects during these years of transition. Much of this, it is true, consisted in rediscovering things known to all the world, which I had previously disbelieved, or disregarded. But the rediscovery was to me a discovery, giving me plenary possession of the truths, not as traditional platitudes, but fresh from their source: and it seldom failed to place them in some new light, by which they were reconciled with, and seemed to confirm while they modified, the truths less generally known which lay in my early opinions, and in no essential part of which I at any time wavered. All my new thinking only laid the foundation of these more deeply and strongly, while it often removed misapprehension and confusion of ideas which had perverted their effect. For example, during the later returns of my dejection, the doctrine of what is called Philosophical Necessity weighed on my existence like an incubus. I felt as if I was scientifically proved to be the helpless slave of antecedent circumstances; as if my character and that of all others had been formed for us by agencies beyond our control, and was wholly out of our own power. I often said to myself, what a relief it would be if I could disbelieve the doctrine of the formation of character by circumstances; and remembering the wish of Fox respecting the doctrine of resistance to governments, that it might never be forgotten by kings, nor remembered by subjects, I said that it would be a blessing if the doctrine of necessity could be believed by all quoad the characters of others, and disbelieved in regard to their own. I pondered painfully on the subject, till gradually I saw light through it. I perceived, that the word Necessity, as a name for the doctrine of Cause and Effect applied to human action, carried with it a misleading association; and that this ssociation was the operative force in the depressing and paralysing influence which I had experienced: I saw that though our character is formed by circumstances, our own desires can do much to shape those circumstances; and that what is really inspiriting and ennobling in the doctrine of freewill, is the conviction that we have real power over the formation of our own character; that our will, by influencing some of our circumstances, can modify our future habits or capabilities of willing. All this was entirely consistent with the doctrine of circumstances, or rather, was that doctrine itself, properly understood. From that time I drew in my own mind, a clear distinction between the doctrine of circumstances, and Fatalism; discarding altogether the misleading word Necessity. The theory, which I now for the first time rightly apprehended, ceased altogether to be discouraging, and besides the relief to my spirits, I no longer suffered under the burthen, so heavy to one who aims at being a reformer in opinions, of thinking one doctrine true, and the contrary doctrine morally beneficial. The train of thought which had extricated me from this dilemma, seemed to me, in after years, fitted to render a similar service to others; and it now forms the chapter on Liberty and Necessity in the concluding Book of my System of Logic. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此外，在政治学上，尽管我不再承认《论政府》中的学说是个科学的理论；尽管我不再认为代议制民主是完美的原则，而把它看成时间、地点和环境的问题；尽管我现在更把政治制度的选择看作是道德和教育的问题，而不仅是物质利益的问题，我认为它应该主要由以下考虑决定，即生活和文化中的何种重大进步是相关的人们进一步发展的条件，什么制度最有可能促进这种发展。然而，我的政治哲学前提的变化，并没有改变我符合时代和国家需要的实际政治信念。我仍然是个激进分子和民主主义者，对欧洲来说如此，对英国尤是如此。我认为，在英国宪法中，贵族阶层、贵族和富人的优势是值得尽一切努力摆脱的罪恶。不是由于税金或任何类似的小麻烦，而是因为它是这个国家巨大的腐化力量。说它腐化，首先是因为，它把私人利益置于国家的公共利益之上，滥用立法权力为统治阶级谋利益，从而使政府行为变成低级的公共不道德的样板。其次，在更大程度上是因为大众的尊敬主要缚在了社会当时状态下的权力通行证上。在英国的制度下，财富——不管是世袭的还是后来获得的——几乎是政治影响力的唯一源泉。财富以及财富的标志，几乎是唯一真正受人尊敬的东西，也是人们努力追求的主要目标。我想，只要上流阶层和富有阶层掌握政府权力，教育民众和改善他们的生活就与其私有利益相悖，因为这样容易使人们更有力量摆脱压迫。但是，如果民主政治获得较大的，也许是主要的控制力，那么富裕阶层就可能会有兴趣促进他们的教育，以期避开真正麻烦的错误，尤其是那些会导致不公平地侵害财产的错误。由于这些原因，我不仅一如既往地热心拥护民主的制度，还真心希望欧文主义者、圣西门学派和所有反财产的学说能够在贫穷阶层中广泛传播。不是说我认为这些学说正确，或者希望人们按照它们行动，而是这样可能会让上流社会看到，没受过教育的穷人比受过教育的更值得害怕。</td>
		<td class="en">Again, in politics, though I no longer accepted the doctrine of the Essay on Government as a scientific theory; though I ceased to consider representative democracy as an absolute principle, and regarded it as a question of time, place, and circumstance; though I now looked upon the choice of political institutions as a moral and educational question more than one of material interests, thinking that it ought to be decided mainly by the consideration, what great improvement in life and culture stands next in order for the people concerned, as the condition of their further progress, and what institutions are most likely to promote that; nevertheless, this change in the premises of my political philosophy did not alter my practical political creed as to the requirements of my own time and country. I was as much as ever a Radical and Democrat for Europe, and especially for England. I thought the predominance of the aristocratic classes, the noble and the rich, in the English Constitution, an evil worth any struggle to get rid of; not on account of taxes, or any such comparatively small inconvenience, but as the great demoralizing agency in the country. Demoralizing, first, because it made the conduct of the Government an example of gross public immorality, through the predominance of private over public interests in the State, and the abuse of the powers of legislation for the advantage of classes. Secondly, and in a still greater degree, because the respect of the multitude always attaching itself principally to that which, in the existing state of society, is the chief passport to power; and under English institutions, riches, hereditary or acquired, being the almost exclusive source of political importance; riches, and the signs of riches, were almost the only things really respected, and the life of the people was mainly devoted to the pursuit of them. I thought, that while the higher and richer classes held the power of government, the instruction and improvement of the mass of the people were contrary to the self-interest of those classes, because tending to render the people more powerful for throwing off the yoke: but if the democracy obtained a large, and perhaps the principal share, in the governing power, it would become the interest of the opulent classes to promote their education, in order to ward off really mischievous errors, and especially those which would lead to unjust violations of property. On these grounds I was not only as ardent as ever for democratic institutions, but earnestly hoped that Owenite, St. Simonian, and all other anti-property doctrines might spread widely among the poorer classes; not that I thought those doctrines true, or desired that they should be acted on, but in order that the higher classes might be made to see that they had more to fear from the poor when uneducated, than when educated. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >法国七月革命时我的心境就是这样的。它激起了我最大的热情，可以说给了我一个新的生命。我立刻去了巴黎，被介绍给拉斐德，为我后来与极端民主党派好几个活跃的领袖保持交往打下了基础。回来以后，我以作家身份，热心地加入了当时的政治讨论。由于格雷勋爵内阁的组成以及《改革法案》的提议，讨论很快变得更加令人兴奋。接下来几年，我为报纸写了大量的文章。差不多这时，曾经有一段时间为《检察报》写政论的方布兰克，成了这个报纸的所有者和主编。人们到现在也不会忘记，在格雷勋爵内阁期间，方布兰克是带着什么样的魄力和才干以及杰出的智慧坚持办报的，也不会忘记《检察报》作为激进主义观点的主要代表在报界获得的重要性。这个报纸出色的特质全都是方布兰克自己的文章所赋予的，几乎占了该报所有原创作品的四分之三。但是另外的四分之一，我那些年的投稿比其他任何人都多。有关法国问题的所有文章几乎都是我写的，包括每周一次的法国政治总览，这些文章经常写得很长。还有很多社论，评论一般政治、商业和财政立法以及我感兴趣又适合报纸刊登的各种各样的主题，包括偶尔的书评。仅仅就当时的事件和问题写报纸文章，提供不了发展任何总体思考方式的机会。但是在1831年初，我尝试在以《时代的精神》为题的一系列文章中，具体地表达我的一些新观点，尤其是要指出当代特征中的畸形和罪恶，它们是从一个已经破败的观念体系过渡到另一个尚在形成中体系时的显著特征。我认为这些文章风格拖沓，不够活泼鲜明，在任何时候都难让报纸的读者接受。但是，即便他们更有吸引力，这些讨论的时机仍然不对，完全达不到预想的效果，因为在那个特殊时刻，伟大的政治变革即将发生，吸引了所有人的全部注意力。我知道它们只对卡莱尔产生了影响，他当时住在苏格兰一个偏僻的地方，独自一人读了这些文章后，他对自己说（正如之后他告诉我的那样）“这是个新神秘主义者”，那年秋天去伦敦的时候，他就打听它们的作者是谁。这次打听是我们私下里成为好朋友的直接原因。</td>
		<td class="en">In this frame of mind the French Revolution of July9 found me. It roused my utmost enthusiasm, and gave me, as it were, a new existence. I went at once to Paris, was introduced to Lafayette10, and laid the groundwork of the intercourse I afterwards kept up with several of the active chiefs of the extreme popular party. After my return I entered warmly, as a writer, into the political discussions of the time; which soon became still more exciting, by the coming in of Lord Grey11’s Ministry, and the proposing of the Reform Bill. For the next few years I wrote copiously in newspapers. It was about this time that Fonblanque, who had for some time written the political articles in the Examiner, became the proprietor and editor of the paper. It is not forgotten with what verve and talent, as well as fine wit, he carried it on, during the whole period of Lord Grey’s Ministry, and what importance it assumed as the principal representative, in the newspaper press, of Radical opinions. The distinguishing character of the paper was given to it entirely by his own articles, which formed at least three-fourths of all the original writing contained in it: but of the remaining fourth I contributed during those years a much larger share than any one else. I wrote nearly all the articles on French subjects, including a weekly summary of French politics, often extending to considerable length; together with many leading articles on general politics, commercial and financial legislation, and any miscellaneous subjects in which I felt interested, and which were suitable to the paper, including occasional reviews of books. Mere newspaper articles on the occurrences or questions of the moment, gave no opportunity for the development of any general mode of thought; but I attempted, in the beginning of 1831, to embody in a series of articles, headed “The Spirit of the Age,” some of my new opinions, and especially to point out in the character of the present age, the anomalies and evils characteristic of the transition from a system of opinions which had worn out, to another only in process of being formed. These articles were, I fancy, lumbering in style, and not lively or striking enough to be at any time acceptable to newspaper readers; but had they been far more attractive, still, at that particular moment, when great political changes were impending, and engrossing all minds, these discussions were ill-timed, and missed fire altogether. The only effect which I know to have been produced by them, was that Carlyle, then living in a secluded part of Scotland, read them in his solitude, and saying to himself (as he afterwards told me) “Here is a new Mystic,” inquired on coming to London that autumn respecting their authorship; an inquiry which was the immediate cause of our becoming personally acquainted. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我已经提到过，卡莱尔的早期作品是促使我扩展早先狭隘信念的因素之一。但是我认为，单凭那些著作永远也不会对我的观点有任何影响。作品中包含的真理，尽管跟我从其他地方接受到的一样，但是表现形式比其他真理都更不适合进入一个受过我那种训练的大脑。它们似乎是模糊的诗歌和德国式的形而上学，里面唯一清晰的东西就是对作为我思考方式基础的大部分观点的强烈敌视。如宗教怀疑主义、功利主义、环境学说，以及对民主、逻辑学或政治经济学的任何重视。起初，我并没有从卡莱尔那里学到任何东西，只是随着我通过更适合我心理框架的媒介看到相同的真理时，我才从他的著作中辨别出这些真理。他提出真理时所带有的奇妙力量当时确实给我留下了深刻的印象，在很长一段时间以来，我一直是他最热烈的崇拜者之一。但是，他的作品给我的益处，不是作为哲学教导我，而是作为诗歌激励了我。即使到我们开始认识的时候，我的新思考方式也还不够先进，无法充分欣赏他的作品。一个证据就是他给我看他刚刚完成的最好、最伟大的作品《衣裳哲学》的手稿时，我还读不懂。然而，差不多两年后，它发表在了《弗雷泽杂志》上，我再读的时候就带着热烈的崇拜和最强烈的喜悦了。我们观点中的重大分歧并未阻止我追随卡莱尔，与他交朋友。他很快发现，我并不是“另一个神秘主义者”，为了表示自己的诚意，我给他写了封信，清楚地表明了我所有他最不喜欢的观点，他回复说，我们之间的主要区别在于，我“至今还不是自觉的神秘主义者”。我不知道他到什么时候不再期盼我注定会成为神秘主义者。但是，尽管我们两个人的观点在接下来的几年里都经历了很大的变化，我们的思考方式并没比我们认识的最初几年更靠近一些。然而，我认为自己不能胜任评价卡莱尔的工作。我觉得他是个诗人，而我不是；他是个富有直觉的人，而我不是。同样地，他不仅能在我之前很久就明白很多东西，而我只能在别人把它们指出后才蹒跚跟随并去证明，而且他能明白的很多东西很可能即使在被指出来后，我仍然不明白。我知道我无法了解他在想什么，也永远不能肯定能看透他。我从不相信自己能明确地评价他，除非有一个远比我们两人都更出众的人给我解释以后才可以——那个人比他更有诗才，比我更有思想——这个人在思想和性情上要远远比他更丰富。</td>
		<td class="en">I have already mentioned Carlyle’s earlier writings as one of the channels through which I received the influences which enlarged my early narrow creed; but I do not think that those writings, by themselves, would ever have had any effect on my opinions. What truths they contained, though of the very kind which I was already receiving from other quarters, were presented in a form and vesture less suited than any other to give them access to a mind trained as mine had been. They seemed a haze of poetry and German metaphysics, in which almost the only clear thing was a strong animosity to most of the opinions which were the basis of my mode of thought; religious scepticism, utilitarianism, the doctrine of circumstances, and the attaching any importance to democracy, logic, or political economy. Instead of my having been taught anything, in the first instance, by Carlyle, it was only in proportion as I came to see the same truths, through media more suited to my mental constitution, that I recognized them in his writings. Then, indeed, the wonderful power with which he put them forth made a deep impression upon me, and I was during a long period one of his most fervent admirers; but the good his writings did me, was not as philosophy to instruct, but as poetry to animate. Even at the time when our acquaintance commenced, I was not sufficiently advanced in my new modes of thought, to appreciate him fully; a proof of which is, that on his shewing me the manuscript of Sartor Resartus, his best and greatest work, which he had just then finished, I made little of it; though when it came out about two years afterwards in Fraser’s Magazine, I read it with enthusiastic admiration and the keenest delight. I did not seek and cultivate Carlyle less on account of the fundamental differences in our philosophy. He soon found out that I was not “another mystic,” and when for the sake of my own integrity I wrote to him a distinct profession of all those of my opinions which I knew he most disliked, he replied that the chief difference between us was that I “was as yet consciously nothing of a mystic.” I do not know at what period he gave up the expectation that I was destined to become one; but though both his and my opinions underwent in subsequent years considerable changes, we never approached much nearer to each other’s modes of thought than we were in the first years of our acquaintance. I did not, however, deem myself a competent judge of Carlyle. I felt that he was a poet, and that I was not; that he was a man of intuition, which I was not; and that as such, he not only saw many things long before me, which I could only when they were pointed out to me, hobble after and prove, but that it was highly probable he could see many things which were not visible to me even after they were pointed out. I knew that I could not see round him, and could never be certain that I saw over him; and I never presumed to judge him with any definiteness, until he was interpreted to me by one greatly the superior of us both—who was more a poet than he, and more a thinker than I—whose own mind and nature included his, and infinitely more. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我很久以前就认识的有识之士中，现在和我一致意见最多的是年长的奥斯丁。我提到过，他总是反对我们早期的宗派主义。后来，他和我一样受到新的影响。他被任命为伦敦大学（现在的伦敦大学学院）的法学教授之后，为了讲课做研究而在波恩住了一段时间。德国文学、德国人性格和社会状态的影响，使他的人生观产生了很明显的变化。他的性情温和了很多，没那么好斗爱争辩了，他开始转向爱好诗歌和沉思。他不再像以前一样那么重视外部变化，除非与此同时，内部性情也得到更好的陶冶。英国人的生活普遍很自私，缺乏宽广的思想和无私的愿望，还有英国所有阶层热衷的卑微目标，他都特别讨厌。即便对英国人关心的那种公共利益，他也不太瞧得起。他认为，普鲁士君主政体比英国的代议制政府实行了更多实际的善政（这是真的），更关心所有阶层人民的教育和思想进步。和法国《经济学人》的观点一样，他认为真正确保善政的是“见多识广的民众”，不一定是民主制度的成果。但如果没有这种制度也能有这些人的话，他们就会比这种制度更能发挥作用。尽管他赞成《改革法案》，但他还是预言，在治理上它不会产生很多人期盼的那种重大的直接的进步，事实上也确实如此。他说，这个国家不存在能做这些伟大事情的人。不管在他采纳的新观点上，还是在他保留的旧观点上，我和他之间都有很多共鸣。和我一样，他一直都是个功利主义者，他热爱德国人，喜欢他们的文学，但他从来都没有接受先天原则的形而上学，一点都没有接受。他日益培养出一种德国信仰，一种诗歌和感觉的信仰，但明确的信条却很少（如果有的话）。而在政治上（这是我和他最不同的地方），他不关心大众制度的进步，几乎是轻视它。但是他很高兴地看到，要迫使权力阶层去教育民众，并让他们记住永久改进他们物质条件的唯一真正的方法是限制他们的数量，社会主义是最有效的方法。这时，他也没有从根本上反对完全把社会主义当作进步的最终结果。他非常蔑视他所谓的“政治经济学家的人性普遍原则”，并坚持那些历史和日常经验提供的“人性的非凡适应性”的证据（这个短语是我在某处从他那里借用的）。他还认为，即便在社会和教育影响的开明指导下，也不可能给可能会在人类身上展现的道德能力设下任何绝对的限度。我不知道他是否直到生命的尽头还保持着这些观点。当然，他晚年的思考方式，尤其是他最后出版的作品，从总体特征上看比这时更加保守。</td>
		<td class="en">Among the persons of intellect whom I had known of old, the one with whom I had now most points of agreement was the elder Austin. I have mentioned that he always set himself in opposition to our early sectarianism; and latterly he had, like myself, come under new influences. Having been appointed Professor of Jurisprudence in the London University (now University College), he had lived for some time at Bonn to study for his Lectures; and the influences of German literature and of the German character and state of society had made a very perceptible change in his views of life. His personal disposition was much softened; he was less militant and polemic; his tastes had begun to turn themselves towards the poetic and contemplative. He attached much less importance than formerly to outward changes; unless accompanied by a better cultivation of the inward nature. He had a strong distaste for the general meanness of English life, the absence of enlarged thoughts and unselfish desires, the low objects on which the faculties of all classes of the English are intent. Even the kind of public interests which Englishmen care for, he held in very little esteem. He thought that there was more practical good government, and (which is true enough) infinitely more care for the education and mental improvement of all ranks of the people, under the Prussian monarchy, than under the English representative government: and he held, with the French Economists, that the real security for good government is “un peuple éclairé,” which is not always the fruit of popular institutions, and which if it could be had without them, would do their work better than they. Though he approved of the Reform Bill, he predicted, what in fact occurred, that it would not produce the great immediate improvements in government, which many expected from it. The men, he said, who could do these great things, did not exist in the country. There were many points of sympathy between him and me, both in the new opinions he had adopted and in the old ones which he retained. Like me, he never ceased to be an utilitarian, and with all his love of the Germans, and enjoyment of their literature, never became in the smallest degree reconciled to the innate-principle metaphysics. He cultivated more and more a kind of German religion, a religion of poetry and feeling with little, if anything of positive dogma; while, in politics (and here it was that I most differed with him) he acquired an indifference, bordering on contempt, for the progress of popular institutions: though he rejoiced in that of Socialism, as the most effectual means of compelling the powerful classes to educate the people, and to impress on them the only real means of permanently improving their material condition, a limitation of their numbers. Neither was he, at this time, fundamentally opposed to Socialism in itself as an ultimate result of improvement. He professed great disrespect for what he called “the universal principles of human nature of the political economists,” and insisted on the evidence which history and daily experience afford of the “extraordinary pliability of human nature” (a phrase which I have somewhere borrowed from him); nor did he think it possible to set any positive bounds to the moral capabilities which might unfold themselves in mankind, under an enlightened direction of social and educational influences. Whether he retained all these opinions to the end of life I know not. Certainly the modes of thinking of his later years and especially of his last publication were much more Tory in their general character, than those which he held at this time. </td></tr>

Fortunately we were almost always in strong agreement on the political questions of the day, which engrossed a large part of his interest and of his conversation. On those matters of opinion on which we differed, we talked little. He knew that the habit of thinking for myself, which his mode of education had fostered, sometimes led me to opinions different from his, and he perceived from time to time that I did not always tell him how different.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我还应该谈谈这些年我写的东西，除了给报纸的投稿之外，还有很多。1830年和1831年，我写了五篇论文，后来以《论政治经济学中一些未处理的问题》的书名出版，除了在1833年的时候我改写了第五篇的一部分外，其他的基本和现在见到的一样。写这些论文的时候没打算要立刻发表。几年后，当我把它们拿给一位出版商时，却被他拒绝了。1844年《逻辑学体系》一书成功后，它们才得以发表。我也继续思考逻辑学这个主题，和前人一样，对于通过一般的推理就能发现新真理这个似乎矛盾的观点，我也很迷惑。至于事实，则毋庸置疑。就像所有的推理都可以分解成三段论法，在每个三段论法中，结论实际上包含和隐含在前提里面，这没什么可怀疑的。结论被这样包含和隐含着，怎么能是新真理。几何学的定理，表面上看与定义和公理如此不同，怎么会包含在它们里面。我想，这个困难是谁都没有充分感觉到的，也还没有被成功解释清楚过。惠特利和其他人提供的解释尽管可以让人暂时满意，但在我心中总是还有一团迷雾笼罩在这个问题上。终于，在第二遍或第三遍读杜格尔·斯图尔特第二卷中论推理的章节时，我在每个点上都提问自己，并且尽可能地把书中提出的每个思想主题追查到底，我突然想起他说过在推理中用公理，我记得以前没注意过，但是现在，在思索这个问题的时候，我觉得不仅公理可以用在推理中，而且所有普通的命题都可以，这似乎是解开整个困惑的关键。这个萌芽发展成了三段论的理论，在《逻辑学体系》的第二卷里提了出来。通过把它写下来，我迅速把这个理论确定了下来。现在，我更加希望能创作一部新颖、有价值的逻辑学作品，我从以前粗糙、不完善的手稿着手，开始写第一卷。我现在所写的东西，成了随后的论文中相应部分的基础。只是不包括后来加上去的《类别理论》，那是我草拟第三卷最后几章的题目碰到困难时想出来的，要是没有类别理论这些困难就无法解决。在我现在到达的这个关头上，我停了下来，一停就是五年。我已经到了极限了。此时，我无法写出任何让人满意的关于归纳法的文章。我继续读任何看起来有希望为归纳法提供一线光亮的书籍，尽量利用它们的成果。但是在很长一段时间里，我没找到任何能给我提供非常重要思路的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">It remains to speak of what I wrote during these years, which, independently of my contributions to newspapers, was considerable. In 1830 and 1831 I wrote the five Essays since published under the title of Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy, almost as they now stand, except that in 1833 I partially rewrote the fifth Essay. They were written with no immediate purpose of publication; and when, some years later, I offered them to a publisher, he declined them. They were only printed in 1844, after the success of the System of Logic. I also resumed my speculations on this last subject, and puzzled myself, like others before me, with the great paradox of the discovery of new truths by general reasoning. As to the fact, there could be no doubt. As little could it be doubted, that all reasoning is resolvable into syllogisms, and that in every syllogism the conclusion is actually contained and implied in the premises. How, being so contained and implied, it could be new truth, and how the theorems of geometry, so different in appearance from the definitions and axioms, could be all contained in these, was a difficulty which no one, I thought, had sufficiently felt, and which at all events no one had succeeded in clearing up. The explanations offered by Whately and others, though they might give a temporary satisfaction, always, in my mind, left a mist still hanging over the subject. At last, when reading a second or third time the chapters on Reasoning in the second volume of Dugald Stewart, interrogating myself on every point, and following out, as far as I knew how, every topic of thought which the book suggested, I came upon an idea of his respecting the use of axioms in ratiocination, which I did not remember to have before noticed, but which now, in meditating on it, seemed to me not only true of axioms, but of all general propositions whatever, and to be the key of the whole perplexity. From this germ grew the theory of the Syllogism propounded in the second Book of the Logic; which I immediately fixed by writing it out. And now, with greatly increased hope of being able to produce a work on Logic, of some originality and value, I proceeded to write the First Book, from the rough and imperfect draft I had already made. What I now wrote became the basis of that part of the subsequent Treatise; except that it did not contain the Theory of Kinds, which was a later addition, suggested by otherwise inextricable difficulties which met me in my first attempt to work out the subject of some of the concluding chapters of the Third Book. At the point which I have now reached I made a halt, which lasted five years. I had come to the end of my tether; I could make nothing satisfactory of Induction, at this time. I continued to read any book which seemed to promise light on the subject, and appropriated, as well as I could, the results; but for a long time I found nothing which seemed to open to me any very important vein of meditation. </td></tr>

The paper in question is the one on the rights and duties of the State respecting Corporation and Church Property, now standing first among the collected Dissertations and Discussions; where one of my articles in Tait, “The Currency Juggle,” also appears. In the whole mass of what I wrote previous to these, there is nothing of sufficient permanent value to justify reprinting. The paper in the Jurist, which I still think a very complete discussion of the rights of the State over Foundations, shewed both sides of my opinions, asserting as firmly as I should have done at any time, the doctrine that all endowments are national property, which the government may and ought to control; but not, as I should once have done, condemning endowments in themselves, and proposing that they should be taken to pay off the national debt. On the contrary, I urged strenuously the importance of having a provision for education, not dependent on the mere demand of the market, that is, on the knowledge and discernment of average parents, but calculated to establish and keep up a higher standard of instruction than is likely to be spontaneously demanded by the buyers of the article. All these opinions have been confirmed and strengthened by the whole course of my subsequent reflections. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我思想进步达到目前这一水平的时期，我得到了一位女士的友谊，这是我一生的荣耀和最大的幸事，我为人类进步努力做的所有事情，或者希望今后实现的事情中，有一大部分也是源于这段友谊。我第一次被介绍给这位女士是在1830 年，那时我25 岁，她23 岁， 做了20 年的朋友后，她答应做我的妻子。这延续了我家和她丈夫家的老交情。她丈夫的祖父住在纽因顿格林，与我父亲是邻居，在我还是小孩子的时候，就曾被邀请到这位老绅士的花园里玩。他是一位典型的老派苏格兰清教徒：严厉，简朴，有威严，但是对小孩子很亲切，这种人会给孩子们留下长久的印象。尽管和泰勒夫人认识好几年后我和她才成为很亲密或者彼此信任的朋友，但是我很快就意识到她是我所认识的人中最值得敬佩的人。这不是说，我第一次见到那个年龄的她就具备后来她所达到的水平，这对任何人都不可能，尤其对她而言。对她来说，自我改进，取得最高的、所有可能的进步，是她天性的规律；追求进步的热情和能力的自然倾向，必然使她把自己的每一个印象或每一次经验都变成增加智慧的源泉或机会。按照公认的女性天才的标准，在我第一次见她时，她那丰富而坚强的性格就已绝大部分展现了出来。从她的外表来看，她美丽，机智，与她接近的人都能感觉到她那天生与众不同的气质。从内心来说，她有深切、强烈的感情，有洞察力和直觉的才智，有突出的、爱思考的诗人般特质。她很早就结婚了，丈夫正直，勇敢，可敬，观点开明，受过良好的教育，但是不具有成为她的伴侣所需的智力或艺术品味——不过却是位可靠、亲爱的朋友，她一生都很尊敬他，对他有强烈的感情，当他去世时，她悲痛欲绝。由于社会对妇女的限制，她无法把强大的自我才能充分运用于外界活动中。她生活在内心沉思中，只有在与一小圈子朋友进行亲密交流时才有所变化。在这些朋友中，只有一位（早已过世了）是天才，或者说具有和她相似的感觉或智力才能，但是所有朋友也都或多或少与她具有相似的情操和见解。我有幸被这个圈子接纳，很快便察觉到，她综合具备我所认识人的所有品质，而这些品质，任何一样都足以让我欣喜若狂。她完全不相信迷信（包括把虚假的完美归因于大自然和宇宙的秩序），热切地反对那些仍然属于社会既定构造的东西，这并不是源于高智商，而是源于尊贵、高尚的情感力量和非常可敬的天性。在一般的精神特性及性情和条理性上，我经常把当时的她比作雪莱。但是，在雪莱短暂的人生中，他所发挥的思维能力和智力才能，和她最终所达到的水平相比，差距仍然非常大。不论在思索的最高领域还是在日常生活中不太重大的实际问题上，她的头脑都是完美的工具，总是能刺入问题的心脏和脊髓，抓住本质的概念或原则。与她丰富的感受力和智力一样，她行动起来同样精确迅速，加上她在感觉和想象力上具有的天赋，使她足以成为一个造诣极高的艺术家。而她热烈、慈爱的灵魂和有说服力的口才，当然会使她成为一位伟大的演讲家。如果元首地位对妇女开放的话，她对人性的深刻了解，实际生活中的洞察力和聪慧，也会使她成为人类杰出的统治者之一。她的智力天赋，只贡献于我一生中曾见过的最高贵、最和谐的品德。她的无私不是后天培养出来的责任体系，而是完全认同他人感情的心地，并经常在想象中把自己强烈的感情倾注在他们的感情之中，所以经常为别人考虑得过多。她对任何人，或者所有哪怕只能够付出一点点情感作为回报的人，都甘愿付出自己的无限慷慨和爱心，若不是如此的话，人们可能就会认为对正义的热爱是她最强烈的感情。她的其他品质特征，很自然地与这些思想和心灵特质共存：最诚挚的谦逊与最高尚的自尊相结合，对所有值得的人都绝对的纯朴和真诚，对任何卑鄙和懦弱的行为都极度地蔑视，对任何残忍或专制、背信或可耻的行为和性格都表示极度的愤慨。同时，她把自然罪行和单纯的不法行为非常明确地区分开来，即把显示感情和品格中内在恶劣的行为，同那些仅仅违背或好或坏习俗的行为区分开来，这种违背不管本身是对还是错，都是那些在其他方面可爱或可敬的人可能会做出来的。</td>
		<td class="en">It was at the period of my mental progress which I have now reached that I formed the friendship which has been the honour and chief blessing of my existence, as well as the source of a great part of all that I have attempted to do, or hope to effect hereafter, for human improvement. My first introduction to the lady who, after a friendship of twenty years, consented to become my wife, was in 1830, when I was in my twenty-fifth and she in her twenty-third year. With her husband’s family it was the renewal of an old acquaintanceship. His grandfather lived in the next house to my father’s in Newington Green, and I had sometimes when a boy been invited to play in the old gentleman’s garden. He was a fine specimen of the old Scotch puritan; stern, severe, and powerful, but very kind to children, on whom such men make a lasting impression. Although it was years after my introduction to Mrs. Taylor before my acquaintance with her became at all intimate or confidential, I very soon felt her to be the most admirable person I had ever known. It is not to be supposed that she was, or that any one, at the age at which I first saw her, could be, all that she afterwards became. Least of all could this be true of her, with whom self-improvement, progress in the highest and in all senses, was a law of her nature; a necessity equally from the ardour with which she sought it, and from the spontaneous tendency of faculties which could not receive an impression or an experience without making it the source or the occasion of an accession of wisdom. Up to the time when I first saw her, her rich and powerful nature had chiefly unfolded itself according to the received type of feminine genius. To her outer circle she was a beauty and a wit, with an air of natural distinction, felt by all who approached her: to the inner, a woman of deep and strong feeling, of penetrating and intuitive intelligence, and of an eminently meditative and poetic nature. Married at an early age, to a most upright, brave, and honourable man, of liberal opinions and good education, but without the intellectual or artistic tastes which would have made him a companion for her, though a steady and affectionate friend, for whom she had true esteem and the strongest affection through life, and whom she most deeply lamented when dead; shut out by the social disabilities of women from any adequate exercise of her highest faculties in action on the world without; her life was one of inward meditation, varied by familiar intercourse with a small circle of friends, of whom one only (long since deceased) was a person of genius, or of capacities of feeling or intellect kindred with her own, but all had more or less of alliance with her in sentiments and opinions. Into this circle I had the good fortune to be admitted, and I soon perceived that she possessed in combination, the qualities which in all other persons whom I had known I had been only too happy to find singly. In her, complete emancipation from every kind of superstition (including that which attributes a pretended perfection to the order of nature and the universe), and an earnest protest against many things which are still part of the established constitution of society, resulted not from the hard intellect but from strength of noble and elevated feeling, and co-existed with a highly reverential nature. In general spiritual characteristics, as well as in temperament and organization, I have often compared her, as she was at this time, to Shelley: but in thought and intellect, Shelley, so far as his powers were developed in his short life, was but a child compared with what she ultimately became. Alike in the highest regions of speculation and in the smaller practical concerns of daily life, her mind was the same perfect instrument, piercing to the very heart and marrow of the matter; always seizing the essential idea or principle. The same exactness and rapidity of operation, pervading as it did her sensitive as well as her mental faculties, would, with her gifts of feeling and imagination, have fitted her to be a consummate artist, as her fiery and tender soul and her vigorous eloquence would certainly have made her a great orator, and her profound knowledge of human nature and discernment and sagacity in practical life, would, in the times when such a carrière was open to women, have made her eminent among the rulers of mankind. Her intellectual gifts did but minister to a moral character at once the noblest and the best balanced which I have ever met with in life. Her unselfishness was not that of a taught system of duties, but of a heart which thoroughly identified itself with the feelings of others, and often went to excess in consideration for them by imaginatively investing their feelings with the intensity of its own. The passion of justice might have been thought to be her strongest feeling, but for her boundless generosity, and a lovingness ever ready to pour itself forth upon any or all human beings who were capable of giving the smallest feeling in return. The rest of her moral characteristics were such as naturally accompany these qualities of mind and heart: the most genuine modesty combined with the loftiest pride; a simplicity and sincerity which were absolute, towards all who were fit to receive them; the utmost scorn of whatever was mean and cowardly, and a burning indignation at everything brutal or tyrannical, faithless or dishonorable in conduct and character, while making the broadest distinction between mala in se and mere mala prohibita—between acts giving evidence of intrinsic badness in feeling and character, and those which are only violations of conventions either good or bad, violations which whether in themselves right or wrong, are capable of being committed by persons in every other respect loveable or admirable. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >能够与一位具备这些品质的人进行任何程度的思想交流，都会对我的成长产生非常有益的影响。可是这种影响是逐步产生的，而且直到多年以后，她的思想进步和我的思想进步才最终完全志趣相投。我得到的益处远远超过我希望能够给予的。尽管对她来说，她的见解起先是通过情感强烈的性格中所具有的精神本能获得的，但毫无疑问，她也能从一个通过研究和推理得出很多相同成果的人那里得到鼓励和帮助。在她智力迅速发展的过程中，她的脑力活动把任何东西都转化成了知识，毫无疑问，很多活动的材料她都是从我这里获取的，当然也从其他来源获取了很多。我要归功于她的东西，从细节上来讲，即便是智力上的，也几乎数不胜数。关于她对我的影响的总体特征，寥寥数语能说明一些，可是非常不完全。</td>
		<td class="en">To be admitted into any degree of mental intercourse with a being of these qualities, could not but have a most beneficial influence on my development; though the effect was only gradual, and many years elapsed before her mental progress and mine went forward in the complete companionship they at last attained. The benefit I received was far greater than any which I could hope to give; though to her, who had at first reached her opinions by the moral intuition of a character of strong feeling, there was doubtless help as well as encouragement to be derived from one who had arrived at many of the same results by study and reasoning: and in the rapidity of her intellectual growth, her mental activity, which converted everything into knowledge, doubtless drew from me, as it did from other sources, many of its materials. What I owe, even intellectually, to her, is in its detail, almost infinite; of its general character, a few words will give some, though a very imperfect, idea. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >和所有最优秀、最聪明的人一样，那些不满意人类生活的现状，把全部感情倾注于激进变革的人，思想可分为两个主要领域。一个是终极目标的领域，这些目标是人类生活可实现的最高理想的组成元素。另一个是直接有用，实践可以达到的领域。在这两个领域里，我从她的教导中获得的，比从其他所有来源获得的总和还要多。说实话，真正的确定性主要存在于这两个极端里面。我自己的力量全都存在于那个不确定、不可靠的中间区域，即理论或精神和政治科学领域。关于中间区域的结论，不论我以何种形式接受或创造的结论，不管是政治经济学、分析心理学、逻辑学、历史哲学，还是其他任何学科上的结论，在智力上都要大大归功于从她那里学得的明智的怀疑主义态度。这种怀疑没有阻止我继续诚实地运用思考能力去寻求任何可能得出的结论，只是警告我不要带着这种思考性质所不能保证的信心来支持或宣布这些结论。还让我的头脑不仅随时准备接纳，而且急于欢迎并热切地寻求任何更清楚的概念和更完善的证据，即使在我考虑最多的问题上也是如此。与大部分同样沉溺于大量概括的思想家相比，我经常因为作品更具实用性而受到表扬，但是就我本人来说，这些表扬中只有一部分是我应得的。那些被认为具有实用性的作品，不是我一个人的成果，而是两个人思想的融合，这其中一人对当前事务的判断和理解非常合乎实际，对遥远未来的预期也很大胆，很有高度。</td>
		<td class="en">With those who, like all the best and wisest of mankind, are dissatisfied with human life as it is, and whose feelings are wholly identified with its radical amendment, there are two main regions of thought. One is the region of ultimate aims; the constituent elements of the highest realizable ideal of human life. The other is that of the immediately useful and practically attainable. In both these departments, I have acquired more from her teaching, than from all other sources taken together. And, to say truth, it is in these two extremes principally, that real certainty lies. My own strength lay wholly in the uncertain and slippery intermediate region, that of theory, or moral and political science: respecting the conclusions of which, in any of the forms in which I have received or originated them, whether as political economy, analytic psychology, logic, philosophy of history, or anything else, it is not the least of my intellectual obligations to her that I have derived from her a wise scepticism, which, while it has not hindered me from following out the honest exercise of my thinking faculties to whatever conclusions might result from it, has put me on my guard against holding or announcing these conclusions with a degree of confidence which the nature of such speculations does not warrant, and has kept my mind not only open to admit, but prompt to welcome and eager to seek, even on the questions on which I have most meditated, any prospect of clearer perceptions and better evidence. I have often received praise, which in my own right I only partially deserve, for the greater practicality which is supposed to be found in my writings, compared with those of most thinkers who have been equally addicted to large generalizations. The writings in which this quality has been observed, were not the work of one mind, but of the fusion of two, one of them as preeminently practical in its judgments and perceptions of things present, as it was high and bold in its anticipations for a remote futurity. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，在现阶段，这种影响只是有助于塑造我未来发展特征的众多因素之一。老实说，即使在它成为我思想进步的指导原则之后，它也没有改变我进步的方向，只是让我在同一方向上更勇敢，同时也更慎重地前进。我的思考方式上发生的唯一真正的巨变已经完成了。我的新倾向在某些方面应该加强，在其他方面则要节制。但是，观念上唯一实质的变革尚未到来，那是和政治相关的，这种变化一方面在于人类的最终前途更加接近于有限制的社会主义，另一方面在于把我的政治理想从强硬支持者通常所理解的纯粹的民主政治，转变为我在《论代议制政府》中阐明的改良后的民主政治。</td>
		<td class="en">At the present period, however, this influence was only one among many which were helping to shape the character of my future development: and even after it became, I may truly say, the presiding principle of my mental progress, it did not alter the path, but only made me move forward more boldly, and, at the same time, more cautiously, in the same course. The only actual revolution which has ever taken place in my modes of thinking, was already complete. My new tendencies had to be confirmed in some respects, moderated in others: but the only substantial changes of opinion that were yet to come, related to politics, and consisted, on one hand, in a greater approximation, so far as regards the ultimate prospects of humanity, to a qualified Socialism, and on the other, a shifting of my political ideal from pure democracy, as commonly understood by its partisans, to the modified form of it, which is set forth in my Considerations on Representative Government. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这最后一个变化发生得非常缓慢，最早要追溯到我阅读或者说研究托克维尔先生的《论美国的民主》，该书刚一出版我就立刻拿到了手中。与我所知的任何热情的民主主义者的阐述相比，这部非凡的著作提出民主政治优越性的方式都更明确具体因而更具结论性；同时，因民主政治被视为大多数人的统治，就困扰它的具体危险，作者也进行了精辟的阐述和巧妙的分析，他并不是以此为理由反对那被作者认为是人类进步必然结果的民主政治，而是指出民主政治的弱点，同时指出捍卫它的各种方法，和必须增加的补救措施，这样可以充分发挥它的有益倾向，同时消除或减轻与它不同性质的倾向。我现在已经为进行这种思索做好了充分的准备，从这时起，我自己的思想也朝着这个方向不断前进，尽管我此后对实际政治信条的改变持续了很多年，至于这一点，把我1835 年写出来并发表的第一篇《论美国的民主》的书评，与1840 年（在《论述和讨论》中再版）的那篇进行对比，再把最近的一篇与《论代议制政府》一对比，就可以看出来。</td>
		<td class="en">This last change, which took place very gradually, dates its commencement from my reading, or rather study, of A. de Tocqueville1’s Democracy in America, which fell into my hands immediately after its first appearance. In that remarkable work, the excellences of democracy were pointed out in a more conclusive, because a more specific manner than I had ever known them to be, even by the most enthusiastic democrats; while the specific dangers which beset democracy, considered as the government of the numerical majority, were brought into equally strong light, and subjected to a masterly analysis, not as reasons for resisting what the author considered as an inevitable result of human progress, but as indications of the weak points of popular government, the defences by which it needs to be guarded, and the correctives which must be added to it in order that while full play is given to its beneficial tendencies, those which are of a different nature may be neutralized or mitigated. I was now well prepared for speculations of this character, and from this time onward my own thoughts moved more and more in the same channel, though the consequent modifications in my practical political creed were spread over many years, as would be shown by comparing my first review of Democracy in America, written and published in 1835, with the one in 1840 (reprinted in the Dissertations), and this last, with the Considerations on Representative Government .</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在一个附带问题上，我也从研究托克维尔中得到了巨大的益处，这就是中央集权化的重要问题。他对美国和法国经验有力的哲学分析，让他十分重视社会集体事务，它可由人民自己安全地管理，不需要政府的任何干涉，政府不要取代人民的作用，也不要指挥他们的执行方式。他不仅把这种由公民个人参与的实际政治活动视为训练人们社会感情和实际知识的最有效方式之一。这不仅对公民本身非常重要，也是善政不可或缺的，还把它视为对付民主政治中一些典型弱点的特殊抵抗手段，以及防止民主政治退化为专制政治的必要保护手段。而专制政治是现代社会唯一有真正危险的东西——政府首脑对一群相互孤立的个人进行绝对的统治，所有人看似平等，但其实都是奴隶。确实，对于海峡这边的英国来说没有这种直接的危险。在英国，几乎全部国内事务都由独立于政府的机构办理，而在别的国家却都是移交给政府办理的。在英国，中央集权化不仅受到理性的指责，而且受到不合理的歧视。在那儿，对政府干涉的警惕是一种盲目的感情，甚至阻止或抵制了立法机构最有利地发挥作用以纠正一些弊端，比如假公济私和狭隘的地方寡头政治假装成地方自治，这经常是对地方利益进行自私又不当的管理的弊端。但是，公众越是坚定地站在反对中央集权那一边，理论改革家陷入相反错误的危险就越大，而且越会忽视他们没有经历过的痛苦的危害。我本人就在这时也积极地参与了捍卫重要措施的活动，比如1834 年伟大的济贫法改革，我就反对反中央集权化者们带有偏见的无理喧闹。如果没有托克维尔的教导，我不敢肯定自己会不会像之前的很多改革家一样，匆忙地过分反对在英国盛行的这种喧闹。因为在过去，我通常会把反击它当成是自己的任务。事实上，我小心地避开这两种错误，不管我是否正好在合适的地方给它们划清了界线，至少我坚持给双方的弊端以同等的重视，而且认真地去研究协调双方优势的手段。</td>
		<td class="en">A collateral subject on which also I derived great benefit from the study of Tocqueville, was the fundamental question of centralization. The powerful philosophic analysis which he applied to American and to French experience, led him to attach the utmost importance to the performance of as much of the collective business of society, as can safely be so performed, by the people themselves, without any intervention of the executive government, either to supersede their agency, or to dictate the manner of its exercise. He viewed this practical political activity of the individual citizen, not only as one of the most effectual means of training the social feelings and practical intelligence of the people, so important in themselves and so indispensable to good government, but also as the specific counteractive to some of the characteristic infirmities of democracy, and a necessary protection against its degenerating into the only despotism of which, in the modern world, there is real danger—the absolute rule of the head of the executive over a congregation of isolated individuals, all equals but all slaves. There was, indeed, no immediate peril from this source on the British side of the channel, where nine-tenths of the internal business which elsewhere devolves on the government, was transacted by agencies independent of it; where centralization was, and is, the subject not only of rational disapprobation, but of unreasoning prejudice; where jealousy of government interference was a blind feeling preventing or resisting even the most beneficial exertion of legislative authority to correct the abuses of what pretends to be local self-government, but is, too often, selfish mismanagement of local interests, by a jobbing and borné local oligarchy. But the more certain the public were to go wrong on the side opposed to centralization, the greater danger was there lest philosophic reformers should fall into the contrary error, and overlook the mischiefs of which they had been spared the painful experience. I was myself, at this very time, actively engaged in defending important measures, such as the great Poor Law Reform of 1834, against an irrational clamour grounded on the anti-centralization prejudice: and had it not been for the lessons of Tocqueville, I do not know that I might not, like many reformers before me, have been hurried into the excess opposite to that, which, being the one prevalent in my own country, it was generally my business to combat. As it is, I have steered carefully between the two errors, and whether I have or have not drawn the line between them exactly in the right place, I have at least insisted with equal emphasis upon the evils on both sides, and have made the means of reconciling the advantages of both, a subject of serious study. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同时，改革后的议会进行了第一次选举，我的好几位最著名的激进派朋友和熟人都入选了。包括格罗特、罗巴克、布勒、威廉. 莫尔斯沃思爵士、约翰. 罗米利和爱德华. 罗米利，还有其他几个人。此外，还有沃伯顿、斯特拉特等早已进入议会的一些人。这些人自认为是哲学激进派，他们的朋友也这样称呼他们，他们现在获得的地位比以前的都更有利，似乎有很好的机会展示自己的能力。我和父亲对他们寄予厚望。然而，这些希望注定要破灭。在投票问题上，这些人很诚实，忠于自己的主张，经常不在乎很多挫折。当议会提出的议案与他们的原则极其不一致时，比如《爱尔兰镇压法案》或者1837 年的《加拿大镇压法案》，他们就勇敢地站了出来，挑战所有的敌对和偏见，而不放弃正确的主张。但是总的来说，他们对发扬任何观念都没起到多大作用。他们没什么进取心，也没采取多少行动，还把下议院激进派的领导权交给老议员休谟和奥康奈尔。但必须看到有一两个年轻人是例外，比如罗巴克，他就有资格被人们永远记住，因为就在他进入议会的头一年，他就发起了（或者说在布鲁厄姆尝试失败后，重新发起了）议会全民教育运动。他还是第一个发起争取殖民地自治运动的人，而且很多年来，几乎一直靠自己的力量坚持了下去。任何其他个人所做的事情，加起来都不能和这两件事相提并论，即使是人们寄予厚望的人。现在平静地回想起来，这些人的不足并不像我们想象的那么多，我们对他们期望其实太高了。他们所处的环境很不利，他们的命运被锁定在那必然保守的十年，那时，改革热情已逝，公众真正要求的少数立法上的改良已匆匆实现，权力正回归到其自然的方向上，回到那些主张保持现状的人手里。这时，公众的心灵希望休息，比战争结束后的任何时期都更难以受到触动，把改革的感情发展成支持新事物的努力是无法触动它的。当国家处于这种状态时，必须有一个伟大的政治领袖，通过议会讨论来催生真正伟大的事情，但又不能责怪任何人不是这样的一个人。我和父亲曾希望出现一位能胜任的领袖，这个人既有哲学造诣，又有得人心的才干，能全心全意调动愿意和他一起行动的很多年轻人或者不是那么著名的人；他能够让这些人凭自己的才干，把先进的思想带到大众面前；能够把国会下议院当作教导、推动公众思想的讲坛或讲台；能够要么迫使辉格党接受他的措施，要么从他们手中夺回改革党的领导权。如果我父亲在议会的话，就会有这样一位领袖。由于缺少这样一个人，受过教育的激进分子只能沦落为辉格党的左派。我曾热切地认为，激进分子哪怕能够尽寻常之力去实践他们的观点，就会有很大的成功机会，我现在也觉得自己当时估计过高了；带着这种想法，从那时起到1839 年，我既通过对他们中的一些人进行私下的影响，又通过作品向他们灌输我的想法和意图。我这样做给查尔斯. 布勒和威廉. 莫尔斯沃思爵士带来了一些益处。他们两人都做出了有价值的贡献，但不幸都几乎在刚开始发挥作用的时候就离开议会了。然而总的来说，我的努力是徒劳的。要在这方面获得成功，需要一个和我身处不同位置的人。这项任务只有身处议会里的人才能完成，这样的人有机会和议会里的激进分子进行日常磋商，能自己掌握主动，能号召别人追随自己，而不是激励别人去做领袖。</td>
		<td class="en">In the meanwhile had taken place the election of the first Reformed Parliament, which included several of the most notable of my Radical friends and acquaintances—Grote, Roebuck2, Buller3, Sir William Molesworth4, John5 and Edward6 Romilly, and several more; besides Warburton, Strutt, and others, who were in parliament already. Those who thought themselves, and were called by their friends, the philosophic Radicals, had now, it seemed, a fair opportunity, in a more advantageous position than they had ever before occupied, for showing what was in them; and I, as well as my father, founded great hopes on them. These hopes were destined to be disappointed. The men were honest, and faithful to their opinions, as far as votes were concerned; often in spite of much discouragement. When measures were proposed, flagrantly at variance with their principles, such as the Irish Coercion Bill, or the Canada Coercion in 1837, they came forward manfully, and braved any amount of hostility and prejudice rather than desert the right. But on the whole they did very little to promote any opinions; they had little enterprise, little activity: they left the lead of the radical portion of the House to the old hands, to Hume and O’Connell7. A partial exception must be made in favour of one or two of the younger men; and in the case of Roebuck, it is his title to permanent remembrance, that in the very first year during which he sat in Parliament, he originated (or re-originated after the unsuccessful attempt of Mr. Brougham) the parliamentary movement for National Education; and that he was the first to commence, and for years carried on almost alone, the contest for the self-government of the Colonies. Nothing, on the whole equal to these two things, was done by any other individual, even of those from whom most was expected. And now, on a calm retrospect, I can perceive that the men were less in fault than we supposed, and that we had expected too much from them. They were in unfavourable circumstances. Their lot was cast in the ten years of inevitable reaction, when, the Reform excitement being over, and the few legislative improvements which the public really called for having been rapidly effected, power gravitated back in its natural direction, to those who were for keeping things as they were; when the public mind desired rest, and was less disposed than at any other period since the peace, to let itself be moved by attempts to work up the reform feeling into fresh activity in favour of new things. It would have required a great political leader, which no one is to be blamed for not being, to have effected really great things by parliamentary discussion when the nation was in this mood. My father and I had hoped that some competent leader might arise; some man of philosophic attainments and popular talents, who could have put heart into the many younger or less distinguished men that would have been ready to join him—could have made them available, to the extent of their talents, in bringing advanced ideas before the public—could have used the House of Commons as a rostra or a teacher’s chair for instructing and impelling the public mind; and would either have forced the Whigs8 to receive their measures from him, or have taken the lead of the Reform party out of their hands. Such a leader there would have been, if my father had been in Parliament. For want of such a man, the instructed Radicals sank into a mere Côté Gauche of the Whig party. With a keen, and as I now think, an exaggerated sense of the possibilities which were open to the Radicals if they made even ordinary exertion for their opinions, I laboured from this time till 1839, both by personal influence with some of them, and by writings, to put ideas into their heads and purpose into their hearts, I did some good with Charles Buller, and some with Sir William Molesworth; both of whom did valuable service, but were unhappily cut off almost in the beginning of their usefulness. On the whole, however, my attempt was vain. To have had a chance of succeeding in it, required a different position from mine. It was a task only for one who, being himself in Parliament, could have mixed with the radical members in daily consultation, could himself have taken the initiative, and instead of urging others to lead, could have summoned them to follow. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >凡能通过写作来完成的事情，我都做了。1833 年间，我继续和方布兰克一起为《检查报》工作，他那时很热心于支持激进主义、反对辉格党内阁的斗争。1834 年议会会议期间，我写了一些报刊文章性质的实事评论（题为《报纸评论》），发表在《每月丛刊》上，这是福克斯先生创办的杂志，他是著名的宣传家、政治演说家，后来成为代表奥尔德姆的议员。我和他不久前刚认识，我在他的杂志上写文章，也主要是因为他的缘故。我给他的刊物写了好几篇别的文章，其中最重要的一篇（讨论诗歌理论的）在《论述和讨论》中再版。从1832 年到1834 年，我所有发表的作品（不包括报纸上的文章），加起来有一大本书那么厚。然而，这里面包括好几篇柏拉图《对话录》的摘要，并带有卷首语，这些摘要其实好几年前就写了，但是到1834 年才发表。后来，我在很多场合里发现有人读过这些摘要，也知道我是它们的作者，但是他们当中很多人对我之前所写的其他作品一无所知。为了完善对我这个阶段作品的叙述，我可以补充上一件事：1833 年，布尔沃正在为他的《英国和英国人》收尾（当时这部著作远远超过了公众的思想水平）。应他的邀请，我为他写了一篇评论边沁哲学的文章，他把其中一小部分融入自己的正文，把其余的部分（附有体面的致谢）作为附录印了出来。在这篇文章里，除了我对边沁学说赞许的评价外，还有不赞许的评价，这些评价被认为是一个完整的哲学体系，这是它们第一次得到发表。</td>
		<td class="en">What I could do by writing, I did. During the year 1833 I continued working in the Examiner with Fonblanque9, who at that time was zealous in keeping up the fight for radicalism against the Whig ministry. During the session of 1834 I wrote comments on passing events, of the nature of newspaper articles (under the title of “Notes on the Newspapers”), in the Monthly Repository, a magazine conducted by Mr. Fox10, well known as a preacher and political orator, and subsequently as member of parliament for Oldham; with whom I had lately become acquainted, and for whose sake chiefly I wrote in his magazine. I contributed several other articles to this periodical, the most considerable of which (on the theory of Poetry) is reprinted in the Dissertations. Altogether, the writings (independently of those in newspapers) which I published from 1832 to 1834, amount to a large volume. This, however, includes abstracts of several of Plato’s Dialogues, with introductory remarks, which, though not published until1834, had been written several years earlier; and which I afterwards, on various occasions, found to have been read, and their authorship known, by more people than were aware of anything else which I had written, up to that time. To complete the tale of my writings at this period, I may add that in 1833, at the request of Bulwer11, who was just then completing his England and the English (a work, at that time, greatly in advance of the public mind), I wrote for him a critical account of Bentham’s philosophy, a small part of which he incorporated in his text, and printed the rest (with an honorable acknowledgment), as an appendix. In this, along with the favorable, a part also of the unfavourable side of my estimation of Bentham’s doctrines, considered as a complete philosophy, was for the first time put into print. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是很快就出现了一个机会，使我似乎有能力通过它为“哲学激进派”提供比以往更有效的帮助和激励。父亲和我，还有一些经常拜访他的议会激进分子和其他激进派人士，偶尔讨论过一个计划，就是要创立一个哲学激进主义的期刊，取代意在填补这个位置的《威斯敏斯特评论》。计划已经进展到要讨论从何处寻求资金投入和选择编辑了。然而一段时期内，什么事情都没落实。但是，1834 年夏天，威廉. 莫尔斯沃思爵士主动提议创办一个评论性刊物，条件是如果我不能做名誉编辑的话，就要同意做真正的编辑，其实他自己就是个勤勉的学者，缜密的形而上学思想家，能够用他的笔和金钱来支持这个事业。这样的一个提议是无法拒绝的，于是评论杂志创立了，最初命名为《伦敦评论》，后来莫尔斯沃思把《威斯敏斯特评论》从它的所有人汤普森将军那里买过来，将两者合二为一，改名为《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》。1834 年到1840 年，管理《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》占用了我大部分的空闲时间。起初，从总体上说，它完全不代表我的观点。我必须经常对无法回避的同事让步。这个评论杂志是为了代表“哲学激进分子”的观点而创办的，但是现在，我和他们中的大多数人在很多重大问题上都意见不和，我甚至不能声称自己是他们中最重要的一员。作为一名作家，我父亲给予的合作，我们都相信是不可或缺的，他写了很多文章，直到临终前生病无法写作了才停笔。他文章的主题，以及表达观点时的力度和果断，是评论杂志初期风格和色彩的主要来源，在这方面其他任何作家都是不能比的。我无法对他的文章进行编辑，有时还必须把自己文章的一部分编辑权让给他。因此，旧的《威斯敏斯特评论》的宗旨，几乎没作修改就成了《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》的主题。但是我希望除了这些之外，还要引进其他的观点和另一种风格，也为我自己的少许观点和这个党派的其他成员找到公平的展现机会。主要出于这个目的，我确保该刊物具有一个特色，就是每篇文章上都应该有作者姓名的第一个字母或其他签名，以示文章只表达作者本人的观点。编辑的职责只是确保它有刊登的价值，并且与《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》创立的宗旨不相冲突。在我第一次为它写稿的时候，通过选择文章的主题，我有机会将自己协调新旧“哲学激进主义”的计划付诸实践。塞奇威克教授在自然科学的一个特定领域很有名，但他不应该越界进入哲学领域，他最近发表了《论剑桥研究》一书，此书最突出的特征就是以攻击洛克和佩利的形式，猛烈地攻击分析心理学和功利主义伦理学。这激起了我父亲和其他人的义愤，我觉得这完全是它应得的。我设想，这是个机会，既能击退不公正的批评，同时又能把我对那些问题的许多看法插入到我对哈特利主义和功利主义的辩护之中去，而这些看法和我以前同事的是不同的。在这件事上，我取得了部分成功，然而由于我和父亲之间的关系，如若我把这时对这个问题的所有看法都说出来，无论如何都会是件很痛苦的事情，而且在他为之撰稿的《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》中也根本不可能全说出来。</td>
		<td class="en">But an opportunity soon offered by which, as it seemed, I might have it in my power to give more effectual aid, and, at the same time, stimulus, to the “philosophic Radical” party, than I had done hitherto. One of the projects occasionally talked of between my father and me, and some of the parliamentary and other Radicals who frequented his house, was the foundation of a periodical organ of philosophic radicalism, to take the place which the Westminster Review had been intended to fill: and the scheme had gone so far as to bring under discussion the pecuniary contributions which could be looked for, and the choice of an editor. Nothing, however, came of it for some time: but in the summer of 1834 Sir William Molesworth, himself a laborious student, and a precise and metaphysical thinker, capable of aiding the cause by his pen as well as by his purse, spontaneously proposed to establish a Review, provided I would consent to be the real, if I could not be the ostensible, editor. Such a proposal was not to be refused; and the Review was founded, at first under the title of the London Review, and afterwards under that of the London and Westminster, Molesworth having bought the Westminster from its proprietor, General Thompson, and merged the two into one. In the years between 1834 and 1840 the conduct of this Review occupied the greater part of my spare time. In the beginning, it did not, as a whole, by any means represent my opinions. I was under the necessity of conceding much to my inevitable associates. The Review was established to be the representative of the “philosophic Radicals”, with most of whom I was now at issue on many essential points, and among whom I could not even claim to be the most important individual. My father’s co-operation as a writer we all deemed indispensable, and he wrote largely in it until prevented by his last illness. The subjects of his articles, and the strength and decision with which his opinions were expressed in them, made the Review at first derive its tone and colouring from him much more than from any of the other writers. I could not exercise editorial control over his articles, and I was sometimes obliged to sacrifice to him portions of my own. The old Westminster Review doctrines, but little modified, thus formed the staple of the Review; but I hoped, by the side of these, to introduce other ideas and another tone, and to obtain for my own shade of opinion a fair representation, along with those of other members of the party. With this end chiefly in view, I made it one of the peculiarities of the work that every article should bear an initial, or some other signature, and be held to express the opinions solely of the individual writer; the editor being only responsible for its being worth publishing, and not in conflict with the objects for which the Review was set on foot. I had an opportunity of putting in practice my scheme of conciliation between the old and the new “philosophic radicalism,” by the choice of a subject for my own first contribution. Professor Sedgwick12, a man of eminence in a particular walk of natural science, but who should not have trespassed into philosophy, had lately published his Discourse on the Studies of Cambridge, which had as its most prominent feature an intemperate assault on analytic psychology and utilitarian ethics, in the form of an attack on Locke and Paley13. This had excited great indignation in my father and others, which I thought it fully deserved. And here, I imagined, was an opportunity of at the same time repelling an unjust attack, and inserting into my defence of Hartleianism and Utilitarianism a number of the opinions which constituted my view of those subjects, as distinguished from that of my old associates. In this I partially succeeded, though my relation to my father would have made it painful to me in any case, and impossible in a Review for which he wrote, to speak out my whole mind on the subject at this time. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，我更愿意认为父亲并不像他表现的那样，反对我持有不同于他的思考模式。他无意识地夸大了特别好辩的智力，使他没能公正地对待自己的观点。如果思考的时候眼前没有对手，他就愿意为自己似乎否认的一大部分真理留出余地。我经常发现，他在实际中常常思考那些在他的理论里看起来无足轻重的东西。他的《略论麦金托什》，差不多是在这时写了发表的，尽管我非常崇拜里面的某些部分，但是整本书读起来痛苦大于快乐。很久以后重读的时候，我从它所包含的观点中无所收获，但发现了我认为大体上公正的东西。我甚至和他一样讨厌麦金托什的《空话》，然而他对它的严厉指责不仅不够明智，而且有失公允。我认为，当时有好兆头的一件事情是他非常赞同地接受托克维尔的《论美国的民主》。确实如此，他说得更多，思考得更多的是托克维尔所说的民主的优点，而不是他所说的民主的缺点。尽管这本书在论述政府问题的方式上无论如何都几乎和他的方式完全相反——完全是归纳和分析，而不是纯粹的推理，但他却对它评价这么高，这给了我很大鼓励。两家评论杂志合并后，我在第一期上发表的一篇文章也得到了他的肯定，后来这篇文章在《讨论与论述》中以《文明》为题重印。在这篇文章中，我添加了很多自己的新观点，强有力地批评了当时的思想和道德倾向，批评的基础和方式无疑不是从他那里学到的。</td>
		<td class="en">I am, however, inclined to think that my father was not so much opposed as he seemed, to the modes of thought in which I believed myself to differ from him; that he did injustice to his own opinions by the unconscious exaggerations of an intellect emphatically polemical; and that when thinking without an adversary in view, he was willing to make room for a great portion of the truths he seemed to deny. I have frequently observed that he made large allowance in practice for considerations which seemed to have no place in his theory. His Fragment on Mackintosh, which he wrote and published about this time, although I greatly admired some parts of it, I read as a whole with more pain than pleasure; yet on reading it again, long after, I found little in the opinions it contains, but what I think in the main just; and I can even sympathize in his disgust at the verbiage of Mackintosh, though his asperity towards it went not only beyond what was judicious, but beyond what was even fair. One thing which I thought, at the time, of good augury, was the very favorable reception he gave to Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. It is true, he said and thought much more about what Tocqueville said in favour of democracy, than about what he said of its disadvantages. Still, his high appreciation of a book which was at any rate an example of a mode of treating the question of government almost the reverse of his—wholly inductive and analytical, instead of purely ratiocinative—gave me great encouragement. He also approved of an article which I published in the first number following the junction of the two reviews, the essay reprinted in the Dissertations under the title “Civilization”; into which I threw many of my new opinions, and criticized rather emphatically the mental and moral tendencies of the time, on grounds and in a manner which I certainly had not learnt from him. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，父亲的思想将来可能的发展，以及他和我在传播思想上永久合作的可能性，注定要被中断。1835 年整一年，他的健康每况愈下，很显然是肺结核的症状，捱过生命中最虚弱的阶段后，他于1836 年6 月23 日去世了。直到生命的最后几天，他的思想活力也没有明显减弱。他对一生中感兴趣的所有人和事的兴趣没有减少，死亡的临近也没有让他对宗教问题的信念产生丝毫的动摇（如此坚定而有主见的头脑是不可能动摇的）。在知道自己时日无多时，他主要的欣慰似乎是想到自己为把世界变得更美好而作出了努力。而他主要的遗憾是不能多活几年，没有时间做更多的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">All speculation, however, on the possible future developments of my father’s opinions, and on the probabilities of permanent co-operation between him and me in the promulgation of our thoughts, was doomed to be cut short. During the whole of 1835 his health had been declining: his symptoms became unequivocally those of pulmonary consumption, and after lingering to the last stage of debility, he died on the 23rd of June 1836. Until the last few days of his life there was no apparent abatement of intellectual vigour; his interest in all things and persons that had interested him through life was undiminished, nor did the approach of death cause the smallest wavering (as in so strong and firm a mind it was impossible that it should) in his convictions on the subject of religion. His principal satisfaction, after he knew that his end was near, seemed to be the thought of what he had done to make the world better than he found it; and his chief regret in not living longer, that he had not had time to do more. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在英国的文学史上，甚至在政治史上，他的地位都是很显赫的。从他的价值观中受益的一代人很少提到他，而且同那些远不如他的人相比，他也很少被人记住，他们这样做很不光彩。这大概主要有两个原因。首先，他的思想太过融入于边沁的思想中，而边沁的名声理所当然更大。然而，他绝不是边沁纯粹的追随者或信徒。恰恰由于他本人就是那个时代最有创造性的思想家之一，是最早赏识并采纳前辈们创造的大量最重要的独创思想的人之一。他的思想和边沁的思想在结构上根本不同。他不具备边沁的所有优秀素质，边沁也没有他的所有优秀素质。如果称赞他和边沁一样为人类做出了杰出贡献的话，确实是很可笑的。他没有彻底改革，或者说没有创造出人们思想的一个伟大领域。但是，如果先不考虑他工作中从边沁那儿受益的那部分，只考虑他在边沁没有涉足的领域所取得的成绩，即分析心理学，后代人就会知道，在思想的这个最重要分支里，亦即所有道德和政治科学最终都要依赖的方面，他是最伟大的人物之一，而且这也是该分支发展过程中一个最重要阶段的标志。他的名声不如应得的响亮，另一个原因就是，尽管他有很多观点，而部分通过自己的努力现已大都被采纳，但从总体上来说，他的精神和时代的精神明显对立。正如布鲁图被称为最后一个罗马人一样，他也是最后一个18世纪的人：他把18 世纪的思想和情感风格延续到了19世纪（尽管有所变化和改进），反对18 世纪是19 世纪上半叶的重要特征，这其中产生的或好或坏的影响，他都不理会。18 世纪是个伟大的时代，这个时代有很多坚强、勇敢的人，他适合与其中最坚强、最勇敢的人做朋友。通过他的著作和个人影响力，他成为那个时代伟大人物的核心。就像伏尔泰是法国哲学界的领袖一样，在他晚年的时候，他完全算是英国知识界激进分子的首脑和领袖。鉴于他规模最大的著作《英属印度史》的主题，他算得上是所有合理的治国策略的首创者，但这只是他较小的功绩之一。他会用有价值的思想去丰富所写的任何题材，除了《政治经济学原理》，这本书刚写完的时候是非常有用的，但是现在它的使命已经结束了。他的作品要很久以后才会被完全取代，对研究其主题的学生来说，也将在很长一段时间内都是有启发的读本。他仅凭思想和品格的力量就能影响别人的信念和目标，他也努力发挥这种力量以促进自由和进步，就我所知，这在男性中无人能及，女性当中倒是有一个。</td>
		<td class="en">His place is an eminent one in the literary, and even in the political history of his country; and it is far from honourable to the generation which has benefited by his worth, that he is so seldom mentioned, and, compared with men far his inferiors, so little remembered. This is probably to be ascribed mainly to two causes. In the first place, the thought of him merges too much in the deservedly superior fame of Bentham. Yet he was anything but Bentham’s mere follower or disciple. Precisely because he was himself one of the most original thinkers of his time, he was one of the earliest to appreciate and adopt the most important mass of original thought which had been produced by the generation preceding him. His mind and Bentham’s were essentially of different construction. He had not all Bentham’s high qualities, but neither had Bentham all his. It would, indeed, be ridiculous to claim for him the praise of having accomplished for mankind such splendid services as Bentham’s. He did not revolutionize, or rather create, one of the great departments of human thought. But, leaving out of the reckoning all that portion of his labours in which he benefited by what Bentham had done, and counting only what he achieved in a province in which Bentham had done nothing, that of analytic psychology, he will be known to posterity as one of the greatest names in that most important branch of speculation, on which all the moral and political sciences ultimately rest, and will mark one of the essential stages in its progress. The other reason, which has made his fame less than he deserved, is that notwithstanding the great number of his opinions which, partly through his own efforts, have now been generally adopted, there was, on the whole, a marked opposition between his spirit and that of the present time. As Brutus14 was called the last of the Romans, so was he the last of the eighteenth century: he continued its tone of thought and sentiment into the nineteenth (though not unmodified nor unimproved), partaking neither in the good nor in the bad influences of the reaction against the eighteenth century, which was the great characteristic of the first half of the nineteenth. The eighteenth century was a great age, an age of strong and brave men, and he was a fit companion for its strongest and bravest. By his writings and his personal influence he was a great centre of light to his generation. During his later years he was quite as much the head and leader of the intellectual radicals in England, as Voltaire was of the philosophes of France. It is only one of his minor merits, that he was the originator of all sound statesmanship in regard to the subject of his largest work, India. He wrote on no subject which he did not enrich with valuable thought, and excepting the Elements of Political Economy, a very useful book when first written, but which has now for some time finished its work, it will be long before any of his books will be wholly superseded, or will cease to be instructive reading to students of their subjects. In the power of influencing by mere force of mind and character, the convictions and purposes of others, and in the strenuous exertion of that power to promote freedom and progress, he left, as far as my knowledge extends, no equal among men, and but one among women. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管我非常清楚，在他取得个人优势的那些方面，我远不如他，但我现在必须尝试，看看在没有他的情况下，自己有可能取得什么成就。我希望对公众思想中有关自由和民主的部分产生有益的影响，我把主要希望寄托在《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》这个工具上。没有了父亲的帮助，我也免除了获得这些帮助所需要的约束和节制。我并不觉得一定要遵从其他任何激进派的作家或政治家，只需保持自己的观点前后一致就可以了。因为得到了莫尔斯沃思的完全信任，我决心从此以后充分发挥自己的观点和思考模式，把评论杂志向所有赞成我所理解之进步的作家敞开，即使可能会因此失去以前同事的支持。因此，卡莱尔从这时起经常为《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》写文章。不久之后，斯特林也偶尔写一篇，尽管每一篇独立的文章仍然是作者私人情感的表达，但是总体的基调在一定程度上能够符合我的理念。为了管理这个评论杂志，我和一个名叫罗伯逊的苏格兰年轻人合作，他有一定的能力和见地，非常勤奋，头脑活跃，善于计划，有很多让《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》更畅销的办法，我对他这方面的能力寄予厚望。因此在1837 年初，莫尔斯沃思疲于亏本经营《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》并希望摆脱它的时候（他很光荣地尽了自己的职责，而且付出了很大的经济代价），我非常鲁莽地决定自己负责继续办下去，这一方面是为了我自己的经济利益，也是因为非常信赖罗伯逊的方法，要让他的计划充分试验一下。他的方法很好，我也从来没有理由改变自己对这些方法的看法。但是，我相信任何方法都不能让一个激进和民主主义的评论刊物有能力支付费用，包括主编和副主编的酬劳，以及给作者慷慨的稿酬。我和好几个经常性的撰稿人免费劳动，和莫尔斯沃思那时候一样，但是对于要付稿酬的撰稿人，继续按照《爱丁堡评论》和《季刊评论》的标准支付给他们报酬。而销售收入根本支付不了这笔费用。</td>
		<td class="en">Though acutely sensible of my own inferiority in the qualities by which he acquired his personal ascendancy, I had now to try what it might be possible for me to accomplish without him; and the Review was the instrument on which I built my chief hopes of establishing a useful influence over the liberal and democratic section of the public mind. Deprived of my father’s aid, I was also exempted from the restraints and reticence by which that aid had been purchased. I did not feel that there was any other radical writer or politician to whom I was bound to defer, further than consisted with my own opinions: and having the complete confidence of Molesworth, I resolved henceforth to give full scope to my own opinions and modes of thought, and to open the Review widely to all writers who were in sympathy with Progress as I understood it, even though I should lose by it the support of my former associates. Carlyle, consequently, became from this time a frequent writer in the Review; Sterling15, soon after, an occasional one; and though each individual article continued to be the expression of the private sentiments of its writer, the general tone conformed in some tolerable degree to my opinions. For the conduct of the Review, under, and in conjunction with me, I associated with myself a young Scotchman of the name of Robertson, who had some ability and information, much industry, and an active scheming head, full of devices for making the Review more saleable, and on whose capacities in that direction I founded a good deal of hope: insomuch, that when Molesworth, in the beginning of 1837, became tired of carrying on the Review at a loss, and desirous of getting rid of it (he had done his part honourably, and at no small pecuniary cost), I, very imprudently for my own pecuniary interest, and very much from reliance on Robertson’s devices, determined to continue it at my own risk, until his plans should have had a fair trial. The devices were good, and I never had any reason to change my opinion of them. But I do not believe that any devices would have made a radical and democratic review defray its expenses, including a paid editor or sub-editor, and a liberal payment to writers. I myself and several frequent contributors gave our labour gratuitously, as we had done for Molesworth; but the paid contributors continued to be remunerated on the usual scale of the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews; and this could not be done from the proceeds of the sale. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同一年，1837 年，在从事这些工作的同时，我重新开始写《逻辑学体系》。我在刚开始写归纳法的时候就停了下来，到此时已有五年没碰这个题目了。我慢慢发现，要克服逻辑学这个分支的困难，需要对整个自然科学领域进行全面和精确的了解，我担心这要花很长时间的学习才能获得。因为我不了解任何能够在我面前展现这些科学的一般原则和过程的书籍或其他指南，而我还知道自己别无选择，只能尽量从细节中吸取这些东西。幸运的是，休厄尔博士在这年年初出版了《归纳科学史》。我殷切地读完了它，发现里面有很多东西跟我想要的很接近。这部著作里有很多（如果不是大多数的话）基本原理看起来值得商榷，但是有很多材料可以供我思考时使用。作者对那些材料进行了详细阐述，这大大方便并缩减了我后来的工作。我现在得到了自己一直想要的东西。在休厄尔博士思想的促动下，我重读了约翰. 赫歇耳爵士的《论自然哲学的研究》。在这本著作给我的巨大帮助下，我能够衡量自己思想上产生的进步，虽然在几年前，我读它甚至温习它的时候几乎一无所获。现在，我满腔热情地思考这个主题，并把它写出来。我必须从其他更紧急的事情中偷出时间来用在这上面。在这段时间里，我只能从为评论杂志写文章的间隙里节省下两个月的时间。就在这两个月里，我完成了差不多初稿的三分之一，也是书中最难的三分之一。之前写的，我估计也有三分之一，所以只剩下三分之一没有完成。我这时所写的，包括推理原理剩下的部分（即一系列的推理原理和论证科学）和归纳法这一卷的大半部分。这部分写完之后，在我看来，我已经解决了所有真正的困难，全书的完成只是个时间问题了。进展到这儿为止，我必须先停下来，为下一期的《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》写两篇文章。写完文章后，我又继续写书，这时我第一次偶然读到了孔德的《实证哲学教程》，或者更确切地说，读到了两卷，当时已经出版的也只有这两卷。</td>
		<td class="en">In the same year, 1837, and in the midst of these occupations, I resumed the Logic. I had not touched my pen on the subject for five years, having been stopped and brought to a halt on the threshold of Induction. I had gradually discovered that what was mainly wanting, to overcome the difficulties of that branch of the subject, was a comprehensive, and, at the same time, accurate view of the whole circle of physical science, which I feared it would take me a long course of study to acquire; since I knew not of any book, or other guide, that would spread out before me the generalities and processes of the sciences, and I apprehended that I should have no choice but to extract them for myself, as I best could, from the details. Happily for me, Dr. Whewell16, early in this year, published his History of the Inductive Sciences. I read it with eagerness, and found in it a considerable approximation to what I wanted. Much, if not most, of the philosophy of the work appeared open to objection; but the materials were there, for my own thoughts to work upon: and the author had given to those materials that first degree of elaboration, which so greatly facilitates and abridges the subsequent labour. I had now obtained what I had been waiting for. Under the impulse given me by the thoughts excited by Dr. Whewell, I read again Sir J. Herschel17’s Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy; and I was able to measure the progress my mind had made, by the great help I now found in this work—though I had read and even reviewed it several years before with little profit. I now set myself vigorously to work out the subject in thought and in writing. The time I bestowed on this had to be stolen from occupations more urgent. I had just two months to spare, at this period, in the intervals of writing for the Review. In these two months I completed the first draft of about a third, the most difficult third, of the book. What I had before written, I estimate at another third, so that only one-third remained. What I wrote at this time consisted of the remainder of the doctrine of Reasoning (the theory of Trains of Reasoning, and Demonstrative Science), and the greater part of the Book on Induction. When this was done, I had, as it seemed tome, untied all the really hard knots, and the completion of the book had become only a question of time. Having got thus far, I had to leave off in order to write two articles for the next number of the Review. When these were written, I returned to the subject, and now for the first time fell in with Comte’s Cours de Philosophie Positive, or rather with the two volumes of it which were all that had at that time been published. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我知道有孔德的书之前，我的归纳法理论实际上已经完成了。我获得理论的方法很可能和他的不同，因为结果是我的论述中包含着他的论述里面没有的东西，即把归纳过程简化为精确的法则和科学的试验，比如用三段论法进行推理。孔德在研究方法上一直都很精确，造诣很深，但是他甚至从未尝试为证据的条件下一个精确的定义：他的著作显示，对于证据的条件，他从来都没有获得恰当的理解。然而，这正好是我处理归纳现象时向自己提出的问题。但我从孔德那里得到很多，充实了我后来改写的一些章节。对我当时仍然想不透的地方，他的书给了我很大的帮助。随着接下来的几卷陆续出版，我急切地阅读了它们，但是在读到他所谈的社会科学这个问题时，我的感觉变了。第四卷让我很失望，因为里面所包含的他对社会问题的见解，是我非常不认同的。但是，第五卷所包含的连贯历史观，重新点燃了我所有的热情。第六卷也没有极大地减弱这种热情。仅从逻辑的角度来看，我得益于他的唯一重要的概念是反演法，主要适用于历史和统计学上的复杂问题：反演法的过程不同于普通演绎法，它不是通过一般推理得到结论，再用具体的事例检验结论（这是自然科学中演绎分支的自然顺序），而是通过整理特定的经验来获得结论，通过确定这些结论是否遵从已知的普遍原理来证实它们。在孔德的书中发现这个观点时，它对我来说还是完全陌生的。如果不是他，我很可能不会很快地（或者永远不会）领会它。</td>
		<td class="en">My theory of Induction was substantially completed before I knew of Comte’s book; and it is perhaps well that I came to it by a different road from his, since the consequence has been that my treatise contains, what his certainly does not, a reduction of the inductive process to strict rules and to a scientific test, such as the Syllogism is for ratiocination. Comte is always precise and profound on the method of investigation, but he does not even attempt any exact definition of the conditions of proof: and his writings show that he never attained a just conception of them. This, however, was specifically the problem which, in treating of Induction, I had proposed to myself. Nevertheless, I gained much from Comte, with which to enrich my chapters in the subsequent rewriting: and his book was of essential service to me in some of the parts which still remained to be thought out. As his subsequent volumes successively made their appearance, I read them with avidity, but, when he reached the subject of Social Science, with varying feelings. The fourth volume disappointed me: it contained those of his opinions on social subjects with which I most disagree. But the fifth, containing the connected view of history, rekindled all my enthusiasm; which the sixth (or concluding) volume did not materially abate. In a merely logical point of view, the only leading conception for which I am indebted to him is that of the Inverse Deductive Method, as the one chiefly applicable to the complicated subjects of History and Statistics: a process differing from the more common form of the Deductive Method in this—that instead of arriving at its conclusions by general reasoning, and verifying them by specific experience (as is the natural order in the deductive branches of physical science), it obtains its generalizations by a collation of specific experience, and verifies them by ascertaining whether they are such as would follow from known general principles. This was an idea entirely new to me when I found it in Comte: and but for him I might not soon (if ever) have arrived at it. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在与孔德有任何交往之前，我早就已经是他热情的崇拜者了，直到最后我也从没有亲眼见过他。但是，有几年我们经常通信，一直到我们的通信中开始出现争论，热情冷却为止。是我首先减少了与他的通信，而他首先终止了通信。我发现，他可能也同样发现了，我对他的思想没什么帮助，而他给我带来的所有帮助，全都在他的书里面了。如果我们之间的分歧仅存在于简单的理论问题上的话，这也绝不会导致我们中止交流。但是，分歧主要存在于一些与我们双方内心最强烈的情感结合在一起的观点上，而且这些观点决定了我们目标的总体方向。他主张大多数人，包括他们生活中所有实践领域的统治者，出于情形需要，在政治和社会问题上，都必须接受在这上面比他们做了更多研究的权威人士的大部分观点，就像接受他们在自然科学上的见解一样，对此我完全赞同。在我提到的孔德的早期著作中，这个见解给我留下了非常深刻的印象。在他那本伟大的专著里，我最崇拜的是他非凡地阐述了现代欧洲国家在历史上从中世纪世俗权力和神权的分离中，以及神权的独特构造中得到的益处。我也同意他所说的，即道德和智力优势曾经一度由牧师操纵，但假以时日，一定会交到哲学家的手里，而且当哲学家的意见足够一致，且在其他方面有资格拥有这种优势时，这件事就会自然发生。但是，他把这个思想路线夸大成一种实际的制度，在这种制度里，哲学家们被组织成一种有层级的集体，授予他们几乎与过去的天主教会一样的精神权威（尽管没有任何世俗权力）。我发现，他把这种精神权威当作善政的唯一保障，反对实际压迫的唯一堡垒，还希望通过它使国家和家庭的专制制度变得无害反而有益。所以，作为逻辑学家，我们几乎完全一致，但是作为社会学家，我们无法继续一起前行，这也就没什么可奇怪的了。孔德先生一生致力于贯彻这些学说，在他的最后一部著作《实证政治学体系》里，他策划了最完善的教权和俗权专制的制度，这种专制制度，可能除了伊格内修斯. 罗耀拉外，别人根本不可能想出来。通过这种制度，可以让由精神导师和统治者组成的团体，通过控制舆论来控制所有的社会行为，并在人类能力所及的范围内控制社会成员的每种想法，除了只与本人相关的事情，还有那些关乎别人利益的事情。但是公平地说，与孔德先前相同主题的作品相比，这部作品在情感方面的很多观点上有很大的进步。但是，作为社会哲学的补充物，在我看来，它具有的唯一价值就在于结束了一种观念，即认为任何有效的道德权威，都必须借助宗教信仰的支持才能在社会上得以维持。孔德的著作除了人性，没有认可任何宗教，然而它让人不得不相信：任何受到社会普遍赞成的道德信仰，都可以用来对它个体成员的所有行为和生活施加压力，其力量和潜能确实让人一想起来就很害怕。这本书对社会学和政治学思想家是个严重的警告，它使人了解到，人们在思考的时候，一旦忽略了自由和个性的价值，将会发生什么样的后果。</td>
		<td class="en">I had been long an ardent admirer of Comte’s writings before I had any communication with himself; nor did I ever, to the last, see him in the body. But for some years we were frequent correspondents, until our correspondence became controversial, and our zeal cooled. I was the first to slacken correspondence; he was the first to drop it. I found, and he probably found likewise, that I could do no good to his mind, and that all the good he could do to mine, he did by his books. This would never have led to discontinuance of intercourse, if the differences between us had been on matters of simple doctrine. But they were chiefly on those points of opinion which blended in both of us with our strongest feelings, and determined the entire direction of our aspirations. I had fully agreed with him when he maintained that the mass of mankind, including even their rulers in all the practical departments of life, must, from the necessity of the case, accept most of their opinions on political and social matters, as they do on physical, from the authority of those who have bestowed more study on those subjects than they generally have it in their power to do. This lesson had been strongly impressed on me by the early work of Comte, to which I have adverted. And there was nothing in his great Treatise which I admired more than his remarkable exposition of the benefits which the nations of modern Europe have historically derived from the separation, during the Middle Ages, of temporal and spiritual power, and the distinct organization of the latter. I agreed with him that the moral and intellectual ascendancy, once exercised by priests, must in time pass into the hands of philosophers, and will naturally do so when they become sufficiently unanimous, and in other respects worthy to possess it. But when he exaggerated this line of thought into a practical system, in which philosophers were to be organized into a kind of corporate hierarchy, invested with almost the same spiritual supremacy (though without any secular power) once possessed by the Catholic church; when I found him relying on this spiritual authority as the only security for good government, the sole bulwark against practical oppression, and expecting that by it a system of despotism in the state and despotism in the family would be rendered innocuous and beneficial; it is not surprising, that while as logicians we were nearly at one, as sociologists we could travel together no further. M. Comte lived to carry out these doctrines to their extremes consequences, by planning, in his last work, the Système de Politique Positive,the completest system of spiritual and temporal despotism, which ever yet emanated from a human brain, unless possibly that of Ignatius Loyola18: a system by which the yoke of general opinion, wielded by an organized body of spiritual teachers and rulers, would be made supreme over every action, and as far as is in human possibility, every thought, of every member of the community, as well in the things which regard only himself, as in those which concern the interests of others. It is but just to say that this work is a considerable improvement, in many points of feeling, over Comte’s previous writings on the same subjects: but as an accession to social philosophy, the only value it seems to me to possess consists in putting an end to the notion that no effectual moral authority can be maintained over society without the aid of religious belief; for Comte’s work recognizes no religion except that of Humanity, yet it leaves an irresistible conviction that any moral beliefs concurred in by the community generally, may be brought to bear upon the whole conduct and lives of its individual members, with an energy and potency truly alarming to think of. The book stands a monumental warning to thinkers on society and politics, of what happens when once men lose sight in their speculations, of the value of Liberty and of Individuality. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还是说说我自己吧。很长一段时间以来，评论杂志几乎让我把所有的时间都倾注在了写作上，或者以写作为目的的思考上。《论述和讨论》里收录的《伦敦和威斯敏斯特评论》上的文章还不到我在杂志上发表的全部文章的四分之一。在管理这份评论杂志的时候，我有两个主要目标。一个是使哲学激进主义不再被指责为狭隘的功利主义。表达精确，意思明确，蔑视夸夸其谈和含糊其辞，这些是边沁和我父亲都拥有的值得尊敬的特质。我希望在保持这些特质的同时，给激进主义的思索以更广阔的基础和更自由、更温和的特征。我也希望在认可、吸收边沁所有具有永恒价值的理论的同时，表明存在这样一种激进主义的哲学，它比边沁的更好，更完善。在一定程度上，我达到了第一个目标。我尝试的另一件事情，是鼓动议会内外受过良好教育的激进分子发挥作用，并促使他们把自己变成能够治理国家的强大党派（通过运用合适的方法，我想可能会做到），或者至少能够制定条款规定他们和辉格党共同治理国家。这个企图从一开始就是不切实际的：一方面因为时机很不利，当时改革的热情正处于衰退期，而托利党的影响得到了强有力的恢复；但是，更主要的原因是，正如奥斯汀一针见血地指出的那样，“这个国家没有那种人”。议会里的激进分子当中，有好几个有资格成为进步的激进党里有用的成员，但是没有一个人能够组织并领导这样一个党派。我敦促他们，但他们毫无回应。确实曾经有一次，激进主义似乎有机会能够进行大胆而成功的一击。德拉姆勋爵离开了内阁，据说是因为是内阁成员不够开明。他后来接受了他们给的任务，去查清并消除导致加拿大叛乱的诱因，他表示希望开始任务时身边就能有激进派的顾问。他最早采取的一个措施，在目的和效果上都很好，但却被国内政府否决，取消了，因此他辞了职，使自己公然处于和大臣们争吵的境地。这样一位受到托利党仇视，又刚被辉格党伤害的有影响力的人士，是有可能成为激进党的领袖的。任何有最基本党派策略观念的人，都一定会尝试利用这样一个机会。德拉姆勋爵受到来自各方的猛烈攻击，他被敌人谩骂，被胆小的朋友抛弃，而那些愿意为他辩护的人却又不知道该说些什么。他回国的时候，看上去像个被打败的名声败坏的人。我从一开始就关注加拿大事件，我是他的激励者之一。我要是制定政策的话，应该与他的政策几乎完全一样，因此我能够为这种政策辩护。我写了一篇宣言，发表在《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》上，我以最坚定的立场坚持他，主张他不仅无罪，而且值得称颂和尊敬。很快，许多别的作家也开始采纳我的说法。不久之后，德拉姆勋爵跟我说，他回到英国的时候受到了几乎凯旋般的接待，可能就是因为这篇文章，虽然这是带有礼貌的夸张，但有一部分是实情。我认为，它只是表达得及时，所以在关键时刻能在很大程度上决定结果。就像轻轻一推从山顶滑落的石头，就会决定它会滑向这边还是那边。所有寄托在作为政治家的德拉姆勋爵身上的希望很快破灭了。但是对于加拿大和总的殖民政策来说，我们的所作所为还是有所收获的。部分由于韦克菲尔德的启发，查尔斯·布勒执笔的德拉姆勋爵报告开启了一个新时代。报告的建议扩展至完全的国内自治，这个建议两三年内就在加拿大全面实行。而且，从那时起，扩展到几乎所有其他的欧洲人殖民地，这些殖民地都具有重要社区的特征。我可以说，在最关键的时刻成功地维护德拉姆勋爵和他的顾问们的名声，这一结果是我极力促成的。</td>
		<td class="en">To return to myself. the Review engrossed, for some time longer, nearly all the time I could devote to authorship, or to thinking with authorship in view. The articles from the London and Westminster Review which are reprinted in the Dissertations, are scarcely a fourth part of those I wrote. In the conduct of the Review I had two principal objects. One was to free philosophic radicalism from the reproach of sectarian Benthamism. I desired, while retaining the precision of expression, the definiteness of meaning, the contempt of declamatory phrases and vague generalities, which were so honorably characteristic both of Bentham and of my father, to give a wider basis and a more free and genial character to Radical speculations; to show that there was a Radical philosophy, better and more complete than Bentham’s, while recognizing and incorporating all of Bentham’s which is permanently valuable. In this first object I, to a certain extent, succeeded. The other thing I attempted, was to stir up the educated Radicals, in and out of Parliament, to exertion, and induce them to make themselves, what I thought by using the proper means, they might become—a powerful party capable of taking the government of the country, or at least of dictating the terms on which they should share it with the Whigs. This attempt was from the first chimerical: partly because the time was unpropitious, the Reform fervour being in its period of ebb, and the Tory influences powerfully rallying; but still more, because, as Austin so truly said, “the country did not contain the men.” Among the Radicals in Parliament there were several qualified to be useful members of an enlightened Radical party, but none capable of forming and leading such a party. The exhortations I addressed to them found no response. One occasion did present itself when there seemed to be room for a bold and successful stroke for Radicalism. Lord Durham had left the Ministry, by reason, as was thought, of their not being sufficiently Liberal; he afterwards accepted from them the task of ascertaining and removing the causes of the Canadian rebellion; he had shown a disposition to surround himself at the outset with Radical advisers; one of his earliest measures, a good measure both in intention and in effect, having been disapproved and reversed by the Government at home, he had resigned his post, and placed himself openly in a position of quarrel with the Ministers. Here was a possible chief for a Radical party in the person of a man of importance, who was hated by the Tories, and had just been injured by the Whigs. Any one who had the most elementary notions of party tactics, must have attempted to make something of such an opportunity. Lord Durham was bitterly attacked from all sides, inveighed against by enemies, given up by timid friends; while those who would willingly have defended him did not know what to say. He appeared to be returning a defeated and discredited man. I had followed the Canadian events from the beginning; I had been one of the prompters of his prompters; his policy was almost exactly what mine would have been, and I was in a position to defend it. I wrote and published a manifesto in the Review, in which I took the very highest ground in his behalf, claiming for him not mere acquittal, but praise and honour. Instantly a number of other writers took up the tone: I believe there was a portion of truth in what Lord Durham, soon after, with polite exaggeration, said to me—that to this article might be ascribed the almost triumphal reception which he met with on his arrival in England. I believe it to have been the word in season, which, at a critical moment, does much to decide the result; the touch which determines whether a stone, set in motion at the top of an eminence, shall roll down on one side or on the other. All hopes connected with Lord Durham as a politician soon vanished; but with regard to Canadian, and generally to colonial policy, the cause was gained: Lord Durham’s report, written by Charles Buller, partly under the inspiration of Wakefield, began a new era; its recommendations, extending to complete internal self-government, were in full operation in Canada within two or three years, and have been since extended to nearly all the other colonies, of European race, which have any claim to the character of important communities. And I may say that in successfully upholding the reputation of Lord Durham and his advisers at the most important moment, I contributed materially to this result. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我管理评论杂志的期间还发生了一件事，同样说明了采取迅速行动的作用。我相信，卡莱尔的《法国大革命》能获得早期的成功，并享有盛誉，在相当大程度上是我在评论杂志上写的文章促成的。这本书藐视普通批评家的规则和评论方式，所以它刚一出版，我就赶在这些批评家用否定它吸引大众之前，写了一篇书评并发表了，夸它是个天才的作品，高于一切规则，本身就是规则。不管在这件事上，还是德拉姆勋爵那件事上，我都没有把效果（我想是我写的东西所带来的）归功于任何写作手法上的特殊优点。确实，至少在其中一件事情上（评论卡莱尔的文章），我认为自己的写作手法并不好。在这两个例子里，我都相信，任何拥有读者的人，在同样恰当的时间表达了同样的观点，还对它的正当理由作了较好的陈述，都会产生相同的效果。但是，在我通过《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》为激进政策注入新活力的希望全部落空后，回忆起在这两个成功的例子中，我曾诚挚地努力为值得帮助的人和事作出了即时的贡献，我就会很高兴。</td>
		<td class="en">One other case occurred during my conduct of the Review, which similarly illustrated the effect of taking a prompt initiative. I believe that the early success and reputation of Carlyle’s French Revolution, were considerably accelerated by what I wrote about it in the Review. Immediately on its publication, and before the commonplace critics, all whose rules and modes of judgment it set at defiance, had time to pre-occupy the public with their disapproval of it, I wrote and published a review of the book, hailing it as one of those productions of genius which are above all rules, and are a law to themselves. Neither in this case nor in that of Lord Durham do I ascribe the impression, which I think was produced by what I wrote, to any particular merit of execution: indeed, in at least one of the cases (the article on Carlyle) I do not think the execution was good. And in both instances, I am persuaded that anybody, in a position to be read, who had expressed the same opinion at the same precise time, and had made any tolerable statement of the just grounds for it, would have produced the same effect. But, after the complete failure of my hopes of putting a new life into Radical politics by means of the Review, I am glad to look back on these two instances of success in an honest attempt to do immediate service to things and persons that deserved it. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在建立一个激进党派的最后希望落空后，是时候停止把大量时间和金钱花费在《伦敦与威斯敏斯特评论》上了。作为传达我观点的工具，它在某种程度上达到了我的个人目标。它让我发表了很多我改变后的思考方式，使我和自己早期作品中较狭隘的边沁主义划清了界线。这一点是通过我写的所有文章的总体风格表现出来的，包括各种纯粹的文学作品，但主要是通过两篇试图从哲学角度评价边沁和柯尔律治的文章表现出来的（收录在《讨论与论文》里）。在第一篇文章里，我在完全公正地评价边沁优点的同时，还按照自己的理解指出了他的哲学中的错误和不足。我现在仍然认为这个评论的主旨有着非常充分的根据。但是，有时我会怀疑在那个时候发表是否合适。我经常觉得，边沁的哲学作为进步的手段，在发挥作用之前就因在某种程度上被人怀疑而名声被贬，对进步而言弊大于利。尽管现在看起来有承认边沁主义优点的趋势，但我还是能更满意地看待自己对它缺点的批评，尤其是我在批评它的同时，也证明了边沁哲学基本原则的正确性，这些文章被收录在同一个集子里。在评论柯尔律治的文章里，我尝试刻画欧洲反对18 世纪消极哲学运动的特征：在这儿，如果只考虑这一篇文章的效果，人们可能会认为我过于突出优点，就像我过分突出了边沁的缺点一样。在这两件事上，我把自己和边沁的理论以及18 世纪的学说里站不住脚的观点分开的动力，可能也让我在相反的方向上走得太远，虽然只是表面上如此，而不是在现实中。但是，对于评论柯尔律治的这篇文章，我是这样为自己辩护的：我是为激进分子和自由主义者而写，最大程度地仔细描述不同学派的作家是我的任务，从这些学派的知识中，激进分子和自由主义者们可能会获得最大的进步。</td>
		<td class="en">After the last hope of the formation of a Radical party had disappeared, it was time for me to stop the heavy expenditure of time and money which the Review cost me. It had to some extent answered my personal purpose as a vehicle for my opinions. It had enabled me to express in print much of my altered mode of thought, and to separate myself in a marked manner from the narrower Benthamism of my early writings. This was done by the general tone of all I wrote, including various purely literary articles, but especially by the two papers (reprinted in the Dissertations) which attempted a philosophical estimate of Bentham and of Coleridge. In the first of these, while doing full justice to the merits of Bentham, I pointed out what I thought the errors and deficiencies of his philosophy. The substance of this criticism I still think perfectly just; but I have sometimes doubted whether it was right to publish it at that time. I have often felt that Bentham’s philosophy, as an instrument of progress, has been to some extent discredited before it had done its work, and that to lend a hand towards lowering its reputation was doing more harm than service to improvement. Now, however, when a counter-reaction appears to be setting in towards what is good in Benthamism, I can look with more satisfaction on this criticism of its defects, especially as I have myself balanced it by vindications of the fundamental principles of Bentham’s philosophy, which are reprinted along with it in the same collection. In the essay on Coleridge I attempted to characterize the European reaction against the negative philosophy of the eighteenth century: and here, if the effect only of this one paper were to be considered, I might be thought to have erred by giving undue prominence to the favourable side, as I had done in the case of Bentham to the unfavourable. In both cases, the impetus with which I had detached myself from what was untenable in the doctrines of Bentham and of the eighteenth century, may have carried me, though in appearance rather than in reality, too far on the contrary side. But as far as relates to the article on Coleridge, my defence is, that I was writing for Radicals and Liberals, and it was my business to dwell most on that in writers of a different school, from the knowledge of which, they might derive most improvement. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">The number of the Review which contained the paper on Coleridge, was the last which was published during my proprietorship. In the spring of 1840 I made over the Review to Mr. Hickson, who had been a frequent and very useful unpaid contributor under my management: only stipulating that the change should be marked by a resumption of the old name, that of Westminster Review. Under that name Mr. Hickson conducted it for ten years, on the plan of dividing among contributors only the net proceeds of the Review, giving his own labour as writer and editor gratuitously. Under the difficulty in obtaining writers, which arose from this low scale of payment, it is highly creditable to him that he was able to maintain, in some tolerable degree, the character of the Review as an organ of radicalism and progress. I did not cease altogether to write for the Review, but continued to send it occasional contributions, not, however, exclusively; for the greater circulation of the Edinburgh Review induced me from this time to offer articles to it also when I had anything to say for which it appeared to be a suitable vehicle. And the concluding volumes of Democracy in America having just then come out, I inaugurated myself as a contributor to the Edinburgh, by the article on that work, which heads the second volume of the Dissertations.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The first use I made of the leisure which I gained by disconnecting myself from the Review, was to finish the Logic. In July and August 1838, I had found an interval in which to execute what was still undone of the original draft of the Third Book. In working out the logical theory of those laws of nature which are not laws of Causation, nor corollaries from such laws, I was led to recognise kinds as realities in nature, and not mere distinctions for convenience; a light which I had not obtained when the First Book was written, and which made it necessary for me to modify and enlarge several chapters of that Book. The Book on “Language and Classification”, and the chapter on the “Classification of Fallacies”, were drafted in the autumn of the same year; the remainder of the work, in the summer and autumn of 1840. From April following, to the end of 1841, my spare time was devoted to a complete rewriting of the book from its commencement. It is in this way that all my books have been composed. They were always written at least twice over; a first draft of the entire work was completed to the very end of the subject, then the whole begun again de novo; but incorporating, in the second writing, all sentences and parts of sentences of the old draft, which appeared as suitable to my purpose as anything which I could write in lieu of them. I have found great advantages in this system of double redaction. It combines, better than any other mode of composition, the freshness and vigour of the first conception, with the superior precision and completeness resulting from prolonged thought. In my own case, moreover, I have found that the patience necessary for a careful elaboration of the details of composition and expression, costs much less effort after the entire subject has been once gone through, and the substance of all that I find to say has in some manner, however imperfect, been got upon paper. The only thing which I am careful, in the first draft, to make as perfect as I am able, is the arrangement. If that is bad, the whole thread on which the ideas string themselves becomes twisted; thoughts placed in a wrong connexion are not expounded in a manner that suits the right, and a first draft with this original vice is next to useless as a foundation for the final treatment. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1841年底，书稿已经就绪，我把它交给了默里，但书稿在他那里放了太久，结果错过了那个出版季，因此他拒绝出版，他给出的理由本来可以一开始就告诉我。但我没有理由为这次拒绝感到惋惜，之后我把书交给了帕克先生。在他的帮助下，书终于在1843年春天出版了。我最初并没有对成功抱很大期望。事实上，大主教惠特利已恢复使用了逻辑44这一名称，重新开始研究推理的方式、原则和谬误。休厄尔博士的作品也开始引起人们对我另一部分研究课题的兴趣，即归纳理论。但一本谈论如此抽象主题的专著是不可能畅销的，它只适合研究者，但研究逻辑学的人不仅少（至少在英国如此），而且他们大都沉迷于与我相反的形而上学学派、本体论学派和先天原则学派。所以我不期待这本书有很多读者或支持者，也不期望它能产生什么实际效果，只希望我认为更好的哲学传统能保持完整。我对这本书能立刻引起关注的希望，主要寄托在休厄尔博士惯于争论的习性上。通过观察他在其他事情上的做法，我想他应该会做些什么对抨击他的观点进行回应，从而让人们注意到这本书。他的确回应了，但是直到1850年才作出回应，刚好让我能在第三版中及时回答他的问题。这样的一本书是如何大获成功的？哪些人组成了购买大军（我不敢说他们都读过了）？这两个问题我从未彻底弄明白。但联系很多思考复兴的证据，也就是在很多地区，尤其是在大学（我一度最不抱希望的地方）的自由思考，事情就容易理解一些了。我从未幻想这本书会对很多哲学观点产生深刻影响。有关人类认识和认识能力的德国学派或先验观点，有可能在更长的时间里对英国乃至整个欧洲大陆上那些从事这类探索的人起主导作用（虽然人们希望这种主导越来越少）。但《逻辑学体系》却提供了当时人们迫切需要的相反学说的教科书——这个学说认为所有知识都是通过经验获得的，所有道德和智力品质主要源于热衷联想的倾向。我像其他人一样，对逻辑过程的分析或者可能的证据规则自我运作以支配和调整认知活动的评价不高。如果与其他必要条件结合起来，我当然认为它们很有用处。但无论这些问题的正确哲学观点的实用价值是什么，其错误哲学观点的危害绝非危言耸听。我相信，那种存在于思想外部的真理可以不通过观察和经验，而是由直觉或意识获取的观念，是当下错误学说和不良制度的巨大智力支持。在这种理论的帮助下，所有不知来源的根深蒂固的信仰和强烈的感情，就省却了用理性进行自证，且自身就上升成为充分的证据和正当理由。之前从没有人设计过这样一个工具将所有根深蒂固的偏见奉为神圣。这种伪哲学在道德、政治和宗教上的主要力量就在于它惯于向数学证据和自然科学同源学科的证据求助。把它从这些学科中驱逐出去，就是把它从堡垒中赶走。但因为从未有效地实现这点，所以甚至在我父亲写的《人类心灵现象的分析》问世后，就已出版的作品来说，直觉学派的论述总体上还是最好的。为了澄清数学和自然科学真理证据的真正本质，《逻辑学体系》在直觉派哲学家从前认为无懈可击的问题上和他们会合，从经验和联想的角度，对我们所说的必然真理的特点给出自己的解释，从而证明他们的证据必须出自比经验更深层的来源。这种做法是否有效还是未知数，甚至即使这种深深根植于人类偏见和偏好中的思维模式失去了其纯粹的理论支持，也只是在战胜它的道路上迈出了一小步。尽管如此，这一步却十分必要。因为毕竟只有哲学能够成功地打败偏见，在证明偏见没有哲学支持之前，没有什么其他方法能真正永久地战胜它。</td>
		<td class="en">At the end of 1841, the book being ready for press, I offered it to Murray, who kept it until too late for publication that season, and then refused it, for reasons which could just as well have been given at first. But I have had no cause to regret a rejection which led to my offering it to Mr. Parker, by whom it was published in the spring of 1843. My original expectations of success were extremely limited. Archbishop Whately had, indeed, rehabilitated the name of Logic, and the study of the forms, rules, and fallacies of Ratiocination; and Dr. Whewell’s writings had begun to excite an interest in the other part of my subject, the theory of Induction. A treatise, however, on a matter so abstract, could not be expected to be popular; it could only be a book for students, and students on such subjects were not only (at least in England) few, but addicted chiefly to the opposite school of metaphysics, the ontological and “innate principles” school. I therefore did not expect that the book would have many readers, or approvers; and looked for little practical effect from it, save that of keeping the tradition unbroken of what I thought a better philosophy. What hopes I had of exciting any immediate attention, were mainly grounded on the polemical propensities of Dr. Whewell; who, I thought, from observation of his conduct in other cases, would probably do something to bring the book into notice, by replying, and that promptly, to the attack on his opinions. He did reply, but not till 1850, just in time for me to answer him in the third edition. How the book came to have, for a work of the kind, so much success, and what sort of persons compose the bulk of those who have bought, I will not venture to say read, it, I have never thoroughly understood. But taken in conjunction with the many proofs which have since been given of a revival of speculation, speculation too of a free kind, in many quarters, and above all (where at one time I should have least expected it) in the Universities, the fact becomes partially intelligible. I have never indulged the illusion that the book had made any considerable impression on philosophical opinion. The German, or à priori view of human knowledge, and of the knowing faculties, is likely for some time longer (though it may be hoped in a diminishing degree) to predominate among those who occupy themselves with such inquiries, both here and on the Continent. But the “System of Logic” supplies what was much wanted, a text-book of the opposite doctrine—that which derives all knowledge from experience, and all moral and intellectual qualities principally from the direction given to the associations. I make as humble an estimate as anybody of what either an analysis of logical processes, or any possible canons of evidence, can do by themselves, towards guiding or rectifying the operations of the understanding. Combined with other requisites, I certainly do think them of great use; but whatever may be the practical value of a true philosophy of these matters, it is hardly possible to exaggerate the mischiefs of a false one. The notion that truths external to the mind may be known by intuition or consciousness, independently of observation and experience, is, I am persuaded, in these times, the great intellectual support of false doctrines and bad institutions. By the aid of this theory, every inveterate belief and every intense feeling, of which the origin is not remembered, is enabled to dispense with the obligation of justifying itself by reason, and is erected into its own all-sufficient voucher and justification. There never was such an instrument devised for consecrating all deep-seated prejudices. And the chief strength of this false philosophy in morals, politics, and religion, lies in the appeal which it is accustomed to make to the evidence of mathematics and of the cognate branches of physical science. To expel it from these, is to drive it from its stronghold: and because this had never been effectually done, the intuitive school, even after what my father had written in his Analysis of the Mind, had in appearance, and as far as published writings were concerned, on the whole the best of the argument. In attempting to clear up the real nature of the evidence of mathematical and physical truths, the “System of Logic” met the intuitive philosophers on ground on which they had previously been deemed unassailable; and gave its own explanation, from experience and association, of that peculiar character of what are called necessary truths, which is adduced as proof that their evidence must come from a deeper source than experience. Whether this has been done effectually, is still sub judice; and even then, to deprive a mode of thought so strongly rooted in human prejudices and partialities, of its mere speculative support, goes but a very little way towards overcoming it; but though only a step, it is a quite indispensable one; for since, after all, prejudice can only be successfully combated by philosophy, no way can really be made against it permanently until it has been shown not to have philosophy on its side. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那时我不用积极地关注当下的政治，也不从事文学工作，不用和撰稿人等打交道，因此可以随意地把我的社交圈子缩小到很少的几个人，这对那些过了孩子般虚荣年纪而又有思想的人来说是件自然的事。普通社交，就像那时英国的一样，是件乏味的差事，甚至对那些把社交变成这样的人来说，他们维持社交的目的不是因为它能提供乐趣，而是另有他因。严肃地讨论那些有不同见解的事情却被看作没有教养，全民缺少活力和社交能力，这妨碍了人们培养愉快地谈论琐事的艺术，而这种艺术是上世纪法国人很擅长的。对那些社会地位不够高的人来说，社交的唯一魅力就在于希望借此向更高的地位攀爬。而对那些已经位居社会顶层的人，社交主要是依从习惯和他们地位的需要。对一个思想或感情十分普通的人，除非他想通过社交达到个人目的，否则社交对他必定毫无吸引力。当今大多真正才智出众的人很少接触社交圈，参加社交的次数也很少，几乎让人以为他们完全脱离了这个圈子。而有些思想超凡的人却恰恰相反，他们几乎无一例外地受到社交圈的严重腐蚀，浪费了时间不说，他们的格调也有所降低。在常去的社交圈中，他们变得不那么认真对待自己的见解，还必须对它们讳莫如深。他们开始视那些最高尚的目标为不切实际，或至少离现实太远，只不过是幻想或理论。假如比大多数人幸运的话，他们还会保留较高原则不受损害，但对那个时代的人和事，他们不知不觉地采用了他们同伴的感情和判断方式，以期博得共鸣。一个高才智的人绝不该踏入没有才智的社交圈，除非他是作为传道者加入的。然而只有那些有崇高目标的人才能完全安全地进入这个圈子。如果可以的话，那些追求高才智的人最好与在知识、才智和高尚情操上高出自己很多，或至少与自己相当的人经常交往。另外，如果性格和思想是在人类观念的几个基本点之上形成的，那么在一个真正诚恳的人的心中，建立在这些基本点之上的信念和情感的一致，总是称得上是真正友谊必不可少的条件。所有这些情况统一起来，使得我现在愿意与之交往的人很少，愿意深交的人就更少了。</td>
		<td class="en">Being now released from any active concern in temporary politics, and from any literary occupation involving personal communication with contributors and others, I was enabled to indulge the inclination, natural to thinking persons when the age of boyish vanity is once past, for limiting my own society to a very few persons. General society, as now carried on in England, is so insipid an affair, even to the persons who make it what it is, that it is kept up for any reason rather than the pleasure it affords. All serious discussion on matters on which opinions differ, being considered ill-bred, and the national deficiency in liveliness and sociability having prevented the cultivation of the art of talking agreeably on trifles, in which the French of the last century so much excelled, the sole attraction of what is called society to those who are not at the top of the tree, is the hope of being aided to climb a little higher in it; while to those who are already at the top, it is chiefly a compliance with custom, and with the supposed requirements of their station. To a person of any but a very common order in thought or feeling, such society, unless he has personal objects to serve by it, must be supremely unattractive: and most people, in the present day, of any really high class of intellect, make their contact with it so slight, and at such long intervals, as to be almost considered as retiring from it altogether. Those persons of any mental superiority who do otherwise, are, almost without exception, greatly deteriorated by it. Not to mention loss of time, the tone of their feelings is lowered: they become less in earnest about those of their opinions respecting which they must remain silent in the society they frequent: they come to look upon their most elevated objects as unpractical, or, at least, too remote from realization to be more than a vision, or a theory; and if, more fortunate than most, they retain their higher principles unimpaired, yet with respect to the persons and affairs of their own day they insensibly adopt the modes of feeling and judgment in which they can hope for sympathy from the company they keep. A person of high intellect should never go into unintellectual society unless he can enter it as an apostle; yet he is the only person with high objects who can safely enter it at all. Persons even of intellectual aspirations had much better, if they can, make their habitual associates of at least their equals, and, as far as possible, their superiors, in knowledge, intellect, and elevation of sentiment. Moreover, if the character is formed, and the mind made up, on the few cardinal points of human opinion, agreement of conviction and feeling on these, has been felt in all times to be an essential requisite of anything worthy the name of friendship, in a really earnest mind. All these circumstances united, made the number very small of those whose society, and still more whose intimacy, I now voluntarily sought. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我思想发展的第三个阶段（可以这样说），我和她的思想齐头并进，我的观点在广度和深度上都取得进展。我懂的东西比以前多，以前懂的东西现在则理解得更透彻。我现在已经完全从过分对抗边沁主义的状态中扭转过来。在那种对抗最强烈的时候，我的确对社会和世界的一般看法变得宽容了许多，而且更愿意满足于赞成这些看法里逐渐呈现的表面进步，而不愿变成在信仰的许多方面跟他们完全不同的人。我那时更倾向于把我的见解中更异端的部分搁置起来，现在则赞成视之为几乎唯一的，可以任何方式变革社会的主张。但除此以外，我们现在的见解比我在最极端的边沁主义时期中的见解异端得多。那段时间，对于根本改进社会结构的可能性，我看得并不比旧政治经济学家们远多少。和他们一样，我把现在所理解的私有财产和继承制视为立法的最终结果。除了通过取消长子继承权和限定继承权来减少这种制度带来的不公正现象，我也想不到其他办法。有种观点认为，要消除不公正现象可能还有比这更好的办法，因为无论是否有可能彻底消除，都包含这样一个事实，即有些人生来富有，而大部分人则生来贫穷。我那时认为这只是幻想，我只希望通过全民教育使人们自愿限制人口，这样穷人所占的比例就可以被控制在允许的范围内。简单地说，我那时是个民主主义者，而绝不是社会主义者。与那时的我相比，现在的我们已经没那么民主了，因为只要教育继续如此极不完善，我们就会对公众的无知，尤其是他们的自私和野蛮感到担心。但是，我们对社会最终改良的理想远远超过了民主主义，由此可以直接把我们归类到通常所称的社会主义者当中去。当我们竭尽全力地批判社会对个人的专制时，这也是大多社会主义制度中应有的内容，我们却期望有一天社会不再有勤奋之人和懒散之人之分。到那时，不劳动者不得食的原则不仅适用于穷人，而是公正地适用于所有人；到那时，劳动产品的分配将不再像现在这样很大程度上取决于出身，而是在公认的公正原则的基础上进行协商；到那时，人们不再只为自己获利而努力，而是为了其所在社会共同分享的利益而努力，这将不再是不可能或被认为是不可能的。我们认为将来的社会问题，是怎样把个人行动的最大自由和全球共有原料及所有人平等分享共同劳动成果结合起来。我们并没有自以为是地认为，我们已经预见到通过怎样的具体形式可以最有效地实现这些目的，或者距离实现这些目标还有多近或者多远。我们清楚地看到，若想给社会带来可能或令人向往的变革，就必须使劳动阶层中未受教育的民众和他们绝大多数雇主的个性发生等同的变化。这两个阶级必须在实践中学会慷慨，或者无论如何为公众和社会的目的而劳动和联合，而不是像目前这样仅仅为了狭隘的利益。但人类身上一直有这么做的能力，不会也永远不可能消失。教育、习惯和情感的培养会令一个普通人像时刻准备为祖国而战那样，时刻准备为国家耕耘或编织。诚然，只有通过循序渐进的和几代人长期的系统培养，才能把所有的普通人培养到这一步。但阻力不是人性的主要组成部分。目前，公众利益在大部分人心里还只是很微弱的动力，并不是因为它永远如此，而是因为人们还不习惯对它细加考虑，从早到晚只考虑那些可能对自身有利的事。当现在的个人利益受到日常生活的激发，又受到对荣誉的热爱和对耻辱的恐惧的推动，即便在最普通的人身上也会产生巨大的力量，作出最英勇的牺牲。形成现存社会一般特点的根深蒂固的利己主义，之所以能深深扎根，只因为现存制度的整体方针助长了这种想法。在某些方面现代制度比古代制度更有这种倾向，因为在现代社会中号召个人无私地为公众做事的情形要远远少于古代较小的联邦。这些考虑并未让我们忽视那些草率地尝试去除社会事务中个人利益刺激的愚蠢做法，尽管那时没有或不能提供相应的替代品。但我们认为一切现存制度和社会结构仅仅是临时的（这个词语是从奥斯汀那儿听到的），我们也以最大的乐意和兴趣欢迎精英人士做出的社会主义实验（如合作社会）。无论成功与否，这都是对参加者最有用的教育，培养了他们直接为公众利益行动的能力，或让他们意识到自己和其他人无法这么做的缺陷。</td>
		<td class="en">In this third period (as it may be termed) of my mental progress, which now went hand in hand with hers, my opinions gained equally in breadth and depth, I understood more things, and those which I had understood before, I now understood more thoroughly. I had now completely turned back from what there had been of excess in my reaction against Benthamism. I had, at the height of that reaction, certainly become much more indulgent to the common opinions of society and the world, and more willing to be content with seconding the superficial improvement which had begun to take place in those common opinions, than became one whose convictions, on so many points, differed fundamentally from them. I was much more inclined, than I can now approve, to put in abeyance the more decidedly heretical part of my opinions, which I now look upon as almost the only ones, the assertion of which tends in any way to regenerate society. But in addition to this, our opinions were now far more heretical than mine had been in the days of my most extreme Benthamism. In those days I had seen little further than the old school of political economists into the possibilities of fundamental improvement in social arrangements. Private property, as now understood, and inheritance, appeared to me, as to them, the dernier mot of legislation: and I looked no further than to mitigating the inequalities consequent on these institutions, by getting rid of primogeniture and entails1. The notion that it was possible to go further than this in removing the injustice—for injustice it is, whether admitting of a complete remedy or not—involved in the fact that some are born to riches and the vast majority to poverty, I then reckoned chimerical, and only hoped that by universal education, leading to voluntary restraint on population, the portion of the poor might be made more tolerable. In short, I was a democrat, but not the least of a Socialist. We were now much less democrats than I had been, because so long as education continues to be so wretchedly imperfect, we dreaded the ignorance and especially the selfishness and brutality of the mass: but our ideal of ultimate improvement went far beyond Democracy, and would class us decidedly under the general designation of Socialists. While we repudiated with the greatest energy that tyranny of society over the individual which most Socialistic systems are supposed to involve, we yet looked forward to a time when society will no longer be divided into the idle and the industrious; when the rule that they who do not work shall not eat, will be applied not to paupers only, but impartially to all; when the division of the produce of labour, instead of depending, as in so great a degree it now does, on the accident of birth, will be made by concert, on an acknowledged principle of justice; and when it will no longer either be, or be thought to be, impossible for human beings to exert themselves strenuously in procuring benefits which are not to be exclusively their own, but to be shared with the society they belong to. The social problem of the future we considered to be, how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action, with a common ownership in the raw material of the globe, and an equal participation of all in the benefits of combined labour. We had not the presumption to suppose that we could already foresee, by what precise form of institutions these objects could most effectually be attained, or at how near or how distant a period they would become practicable. We saw clearly that to render any such social transformation either possible or desirable, an equivalent change of character must take place both in the uncultivated herd who now compose the labouring masses, and in the immense majority of their employers. Both these classes must learn by practice to labour and combine for generous, or at all events for public and social purposes, and not, as hitherto, solely for narrowly interested ones. But the capacity to do this has always existed in mankind, and is not, nor is ever likely to be, extinct. Education, habit, and the cultivation of the sentiments, will make a common man dig or weave for his country, as readily as fight for his country. True enough, it is only by slow degrees, and a system of culture prolonged through successive generations, that men in general can be brought up to this point. But the hindrance is not in the essential constitution of human nature. Interest in the common good is at present so weak a motive in the generality, not because it can never be otherwise, but because the mind is not accustomed to dwell on it as it dwells from morning till night on things which tend only to personal advantage. When called into activity, as only self-interest now is, by the daily course of life, and spurred from behind by the love of distinction and the fear of shame, it is capable of producing, even in common men, the most strenuous exertions as well as the most heroic sacrifices. The deep-rooted selfishness which forms the general character of the existing state of society, is so deeply rooted, only because the whole course of existing institutions tends to foster it; modern institutions in some respects more than ancient, since the occasions on which the individual is called on to do anything for the public without receiving its pay, are far less frequent in modern life, than in the smaller commonwealths of antiquity. These considerations did not make us overlook the folly of premature attempts to dispense with the inducements of private interest in social affairs, while no substitute for them has been or can be provided: but we regarded all existing institutions and social arrangements as being (in a phrase I once heard from Austin) “merely provisional”, and we welcomed with the greatest pleasure and interest all socialistic experiments by select individuals (such as the Co-operative Societies), which, whether they succeeded or failed, could not but operate as a most useful education of those who took part in them, by cultivating their capacity of acting upon motives pointing directly to the general good, or making them aware of the defects which render them and others incapable of doing so. </td></tr>

The difference arose partly from the change of times, the first edition having been written and sent to press before the French Revolution of 18482, after which the public mind became more open to the reception of novelties in opinion, and doctrines appeared moderate which would have been thought very startling a short time before. In the first edition the difficulties of socialism were stated so strongly, that the tone was on the whole that of opposition to it. In the year or two which followed, much time was given to the study of the best Socialistic writers on the Continent, and to meditation and discussion on the whole range of topics involved in the controversy: and the result was that most of what had been written on the subject in the first edition was cancelled, and replaced by arguments and reflections which represent a more advanced opinion. </td></tr>

It was commenced in the autumn of 1845, and was ready for the press before the end of 1847. In this period of little more than two years there was an interval of six months during which the work was laid aside, while I was writing articles in the Morning Chronicle (which unexpectedly entered warmly into my purpose) urging the formation of peasant properties on the waste lands of Ireland. This was during the period of the Famine, the winter of 1846—47, when the stern necessities of the time seemed to afford a chance of gaining attention for what appeared to me the only mode of combining relief to immediate destitution with permanent improvement of the social and economical condition of the Irish people. But the idea was new and strange; there was no English precedent for such a proceeding: and the profound ignorance of English politicians and the English public concerning all social phenomena not generally met with in England (however common elsewhere), made my endeavours an entire failure. Instead of a great operation on the waste lands, and the conversion of cottiers into proprietors, Parliament passed a Poor Law for maintaining them as paupers: and if the nation has not since found itself in inextricable difficulties from the joint operation of the old evils and the quack remedy, it is indebted for its deliverance to that most unexpected and surprising fact, the depopulation of Ireland, commenced by famine, and continued by emigration. </td></tr>

Political Economy, in truth, has never pretended to give advice to mankind with no lights but its own; though people who knew nothing but political economy (and therefore knew that ill) have taken upon themselves to advise, and could only do so by such lights as they had. But the numerous sentimental enemies of political economy, and its still more numerous interested enemies in sentimental guise, have been very successful in gaining belief for this among other unmerited imputations against it, and the Principles having, in spite of the freedom of many of its opinions, become for the present the most popular treatise on the subject, has helped to disarm the enemies of so important a study. The amount of its worth as an exposition of the science, and the value of the different applications which it suggests, others of course must judge. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在此后相当长的一段时间里，我没有出版任何重要的作品。但我偶尔也为期刊撰稿，在公共利益的问题上，我通信的数量非常可观（其中很多是写给不认识的人）。这些年来，我写了或者着手了很多关于人类和社会生活的一些根本性问题的文章，开始为最终的出版作准备，其中几篇的严厉程度已经超过了贺拉斯箴言。我依旧热切地关注公众事件的进展。但整体形势并未使我受到鼓舞。1848年后欧洲的反动和1851年12月无耻篡权者的成功，似乎毁灭了法国和欧洲大陆得到自由或社会进步的一切希望。在英格兰，我已经看到而且继续看到很多我年轻时的见解得到普遍认可，很多我一生为之奋斗的制度改革已经实现或者正在实现。但这些改变并没有像我之前所期望的那样给人们带来很多益处，因为它们没有促进人类命运真正改善所依赖的智力和道德状况，甚至连同时起作用的各种倒退因素是否抵消了改良的趋势都值得怀疑。我从经验中得知，很多错误的观念可以转化为正确的观念，并且丝毫不改变产生错误观念的思维习惯。例如，英国的公众，自从国家转型为自由贸易国之后，对政治经济学问题仍然像之前那样生疏迟钝。他们还远没有形成更好的思维或感情习惯，也没有在培养高尚人格问题上更好地加强防范错误的能力。这是因为，他们虽然抛弃了一些错误，但他们思想中的总体原则，无论智力上还是道德上都没有改变。我现在深信，只有人类思维模式的基本结构发生巨大的变化，人类命运才会有巨大的改进。宗教、道德和政治的旧观念在智力超群的人心中已不足信，大部分好的功效已经失去，但这些问题的观念在他们身上却有足够强大的生命力，阻碍更好的观念的形成。当全世界具有哲学思想的人不再相信宗教，或者只有在宗教性质发生根本改变之后才相信它时，一个过渡的时代就开始了。在这个时代，人们信念薄弱，思想麻痹，纪律日益涣散，只有他们的信仰基础发生革新，使得一些信念，无论是宗教方面的，或仅仅是人类方面的，能发展到真正让他们相信的程度，这些现象才会终止。当事情发展到这一步，所有不能促进这种革新的思想或作品都会毫无价值，瞬间即逝。因为还没有明显的迹象表明公众的思想里出现了这种趋势，我认为当前实现人类进步的前景并不乐观。最近，一种自由思考的精神正在逐渐兴起，给英国思想逐渐解放的前景带来了更大的鼓舞。与这种革新同时发生的，是欧洲其他地方的政治自由运动，这是个更好的兆头，给当前人类事务的现状带来了更有希望的一面。</td>
		<td class="en">For a considerable time after this, I published no work of magnitude; though I still occasionally wrote in periodicals, and my correspondence (much of it with persons quite unknown to me), on subjects of public interest, swelled to a considerable bulk. During these years I wrote or commenced various Essays, for eventual publication, on some of the fundamental questions of human and social life, with regard to several of which I have already much exceeded the severity of the Horatian precept. I continued to watch with keen interest the progress of public events. But it was not, on the whole, very encouraging to me. The European reaction after 18483, and the success of an unprincipled usurper in December 18514, put an end, as it seemed, to all present hope for freedom or social improvement in France and the Continent. In England, I had seen and continued to see many of the opinions of my youth obtain general recognition, and many of the reforms in institutions, for which I had through life contended, either effected or in course of being so. But these changes had been attended with much less benefit to human well-being than I should formerly have anticipated, because they had produced very little improvement in that which all real amelioration in the lot of mankind depends on, their intellectual and moral state: and it might even be questioned if the various causes of deterioration which had been at work in the meanwhile, had not more than counterbalanced the tendencies to improvement. I had learnt from experience that many false opinions may be exchanged for true ones, without in the least altering the habits of mind of which false opinions are the result. The English public, for example, are quite as raw and undiscerning on subjects of political economy since the nation has been converted to free-trade, as they were before; and are still further from having acquired better habits of thought and feeling, or being in any way better fortified against error, on subjects of a more elevated character. For, though they have thrown off certain errors, the general discipline of their minds, intellectually and morally, is not altered. I am now convinced, that no great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought. The old opinions in religion, morals, and politics, are so much discredited in the more intellectual minds as to have lost the greater part of their efficacy for good, while they have still life enough in them to be a powerful obstacle to the growing up of any better opinions on those subjects. When the philosophic minds of the world can no longer believe its religion, or can only believe it with modifications amounting to an essential change of its character, a transitional period commences, of weak convictions, paralysed intellects, and growing laxity of principle, which cannot terminate until a renovation has been effected in the basis of their belief, leading to the evolution of some faith, whether religious or merely human, which they can really believe: and when things are in this state, all thinking or writing which does not tend to promote such a renovation, is of very little value beyond the moment. Since there was little in the apparent condition of the public mind, indicative of any tendency in this direction, my view of the immediate prospects of human improvement was not sanguine. More recently a spirit of free speculation has sprung up, giving a more encouraging prospect of the gradual mental emancipation of England; and, concurring with the renewal under better auspices, of the movement for political freedom in the rest of Europe, has given to the present condition of human affairs a more hopeful aspect. </td></tr>

The first of these was my marriage, in April, 1851, to the lady whose incomparable worth had made her friendship the greatest source to me both of happiness and of improvement, during many years in which we never expected to be in any closer relation to one another. Ardently as I should have aspired to this complete union of our lives at any time in the course of my existence at which it had been practicable, I, as much as my wife, would far rather have foregone that privilege for ever, than have owed it to the premature death of one for whom I had the sincerest respect, and she the strongest affection. That event however having taken place in July, 1849, it was granted to me to derive from that evil my own greatest good, by adding to the partnership of thought, feeling, and writing which had long existed, a partnership of our entire existence. For seven and a-half years that blessing was mine; for seven and a-half only! I can say nothing which could describe, even in the faintest manner, what that loss was and is. But because I know that she would have wished it, I endeavour to make the best of what life I have left, and to work on for her purposes with such diminished strength as can be derived from thoughts of her, and communion with her memory. </td></tr>

In 1856 I was promoted to the rank of chief of the office in which I had served for upwards of thirty-three years. The appointment, that of Examiner of India Correspondence, was the highest, next to that of Secretary, in the East India Company’s home service, involving the general superintendance of all the correspondence with the Indian Governments, except the military, naval, and financial. I held this office as long as it continued to exist, being a little more than two years; after which it pleased Parliament, in other words Lord Palmerston, to put an end to the East India Company as a branch of the government of India under the Crown, and convert the administration of that country into a thing to be scrambled for by the second and third class of English parliamentary politicians. I was the chief manager of the resistance which the Company made to their own political extinction. To the letters and petitions I wrote for them, and the concluding chapter of my treatise on Representative Government, I must refer for my opinions on the folly and mischief of this ill-considered change. Personally I considered myself a gainer by it, as I had given enough of my life to India, and was not unwilling to retire on the liberal compensation granted. After the change was consummated, Lord Stanley5, the first Secretary of State for India, made me the honorable offer of a seat in the Council, and the proposal was subsequently renewed by the Council itself, on the first occasion of its having to supply a vacancy in its own body. But the conditions of Indian government under the new system made me anticipate nothing but useless vexation and waste of effort from any participation in it: and nothing that has since happened has had any tendency to make me regret my refusal. </td></tr>

None of my writings have been either so carefully composed, or so sedulously corrected as this. After it had been written as usual twice over, we kept it by us, bringing it out from time to time and going through it de novo, reading, weighing and criticizing every sentence. Its final revision was to have been a work of the winter of 1858—59, the first after my retirement, which we had arranged to pass in the South of Europe.

		<td class="en">When two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common; when all subjects of intellectual or moral interest are discussed between them in daily life, and probed to much greater depths than are usually or conveniently sounded in writings intended for general readers; when they set out from the same principles, and arrive at their conclusions by processes pursued jointly, it is of little consequence in respect to the question of originality, which of them holds the pen; the one who contributes least to the composition may contribute most to the thought; the writings which result are the joint product of both, and it must often be impossible to disentangle their respective parts, and affirm that this belongs to one and that to the other. In this wide sense, not only during the years of our married life, but during many of the years of confidential friendship which preceded, all my published writings were as much her work as mine; her share in them constantly increasing as years advanced. But in certain cases, what belongs to her can be distinguished, and specially identified. Over and above the general influence which her mind had over mine, the most valuable ideas and features in these joint productions—those which have been most fruitful of important results, and have contributed most to the success and reputation of the works themselves—originated with her; were emanations from her mind, my part in them being no greater than in any of the thoughts which I found in previous writers, and made my own only by incorporating them with my own system of thought. During the greater part of my literary life I have performed the office in relation to her, which from a rather early period I had considered as the most useful part that I was qualified to take in the domain of thought, that of an interpreter of original thinkers, and mediator between them and the public; for I had always a humble opinion of my own powers as an original thinker, except in abstract science (logic, metaphysics, and the theoretic principles of political economy and politics), but thought myself much superior to most of my contemporaries in willingness and ability to learn from everybody; as I found hardly any one who made such a point of examining what was said in defence of all opinions, however new or however old, in the conviction that even if they were errors there might be a substratum of truth underneath them, and that in any case the discovery of what it was that made them plausible, would be a benefit to truth. I had, in consequence, marked out this as a sphere of usefulness in which I was under a special obligation to make myself active: the more so, as the acquaintance I had formed with the ideas of the Coleridgians, of the German thinkers, and of Carlyle, all of them fiercely opposed to the mode of thought in which I had been brought up, had convinced me that along with much error they possessed much truth, which was veiled from minds otherwise capable of receiving it by the transcendental and mystical phraseology in which they were accustomed to shut it up and from which they neither cared, nor knew how, to disengage it; and I did not despair of separating the truth from the error and expressing it in terms which would be intelligible and not repulsive to those on my own side in philosophy. Thus prepared, it will easily be believed that when I came into close intellectual communion with a person of the most eminent faculties, whose genius, as it grew and unfolded itself in thought, continually struck out truths far in advance of me, but in which I could not, as I had done in those others, detect any mixture of error, the greatest part of my mental growth consisted in the assimilation of those truths, and the most valuable part of my intellectual work was in building the bridges and clearing the paths which connected them with my general system of thought. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我的作品中，第一本包含她的突出贡献的书就是《政治经济学原理》。而对于《逻辑学体系》，除了精心地安排了文章的结构外，她所作的贡献并不多，但正是在文章的结构方面，我的作品，无论长短，都从她精确和锐利的批评中受益良多。《政治经济学原理》中有一章是关于“劳动阶级可能的未来”的，它对观念产生的影响最大，这完全是她的功劳。初稿中并没有这一章，她指出有必要把这一章加进去，否则的话这本书就会十分不完美。因为她，我才着手写这一章，其中大部分是关于劳动阶级固有地位的两种对立理论的陈述和讨论，这完全是她思想的表达，经常由她亲自口述。《政治经济学原理》里的纯科学部分，我并不是从她那儿学来的，但主要还是她的影响给整本书定下了基调，使之不同于原来那些自称为科学的政治经济学论文，也有效地争取到了那些曾被这些论文排斥的人。这个基调的精髓在于正确区分了财富创造的定律和财富分配的模式，前者是真正的自然定律，取决于物的属性，后者受特定条件限制，取决于人的意志。一般的政治经济学家用经济学定律的名义将这些统统拒之门外，他们认为这些定律是无法通过人类努力来修改或战胜的。他们把相同的必然性归因于那些依赖尘世生活恒定条件的东西，也归因于那些在特定社会结构下唯一必然的结果，这两者仅仅是与之同等延伸的。在特定的惯例和习俗下，工资、利润和租金是由特定的原因决定的。但这批政治经济学家陷入了无法避免的假想当中，主张这些原因有一种内在的必然性，任何人力都起不了作用，也必然决定了在生产分工中，劳动者、资本家和地主所占的份额在减少。《政治经济学原理》不同意前人在他们假定的前提下针对这些原因的作用进行科学认定。但这个例子告诉我们，不要将条件视为决定性的。经济学的归纳不取决于自然的必然性，而取决于必然性和现有社会结构的结合，归纳仅仅是暂时的，容易被社会发展的进程所改变。实际上，我看问题的这种方法部分来自于圣西门主义者理论的激发，但却是因为我太太的提示，我的想法才变成赋予全书生命的通行的现实准则。这个例子很好地说明了她对我的作品所作贡献的一般特点。那些抽象的和纯科学的内容基本上由我负责，而她提出的是恰当的人类要素：就像我学习她大胆地思考和谨慎地作出实际判断一样，在所有涉及将哲学应用到人类社会和发展的迫切需要的方面，我也是她的学生。因为，一方面有了她我才在预见未来的规则上变得比原来更勇敢，更有远见，现在很多有限的归纳经常和普通的原则相混淆，从而失去了适用性。若不是她，我作品中的这些部分，尤其是《政治经济学原理》中那些被社会主义者肯定却被大部分政治经济学家强烈否定的对未来可能性的思考，要么不会出现，要么就是以一种更怯懦或更受限制的形式被提出。然而当她让我更大胆地思考人类事务时，她务实的思想方法，以及对实际困难的正确估计打消了我所有的空想倾向。她头脑中的想法具体有形，自身形成了如何实际操作的概念，而且她对现存的人类情感和行为的认识很少出错，所有不切实际的建议中的缺点几乎都逃不过她的眼睛。</td>
		<td class="en">The first of my books in which her share was conspicuous was the Principles of Political Economy. The System of Logic owed little to her except in the minuter matters of composition, in which respect my writings, both great and small, have largely benefitted by her accurate and clear-sighted criticism. The chapter of the Political Economy which has had a greater influence on opinion than all the rest, that on “the Probable Future of the Labouring Classes”, is entirely due to her: in the first draft of the book, that chapter did not exist. She pointed out the need of such a chapter, and the extreme imperfection of the book without it: she was the cause of my writing it; and the more general part of the chapter, the statement and discussion of the two opposite theories respecting the proper condition of the labouring classes, was wholly an exposition of her thoughts, often in words taken from her own lips. The purely scientific part of the Political Economy I did not learn from her; but it was chiefly her influence that gave to the book that general tone by which it is distinguished from all previous expositions of Political Economy that had any pretension to being scientific, and which has made it so useful in conciliating minds which those previous expositions had repelled. This tone consisted chiefly in making the proper distinction between the laws of the Production of Wealth, which are real laws of nature, dependent on the properties of objects, and the modes of its Distribution, which, subject to certain conditions, depend on human will. The common run of political economists confuse these together, under the designation of economic laws, which they deem incapable of being defeated or modified by human effort; ascribing the same necessity to things dependent on the unchangeable conditions of our earthly existence, and to those which, being but the necessary consequences of particular social arrangements, are merely coextensive with these: given certain institutions and customs, wages, profits, and rent will be determined by certain causes; but this class of political economists drop the indispensable presupposition, and argue that these causes must, by an inherent necessity, against which no human means can avail, determine the shares which fall, in the division of the produce, to labourers, capitalists, and landlords. The Principles of Political Economy yielded to none of its predecessors in aiming at the scientific appreciation of the action of these causes, under the conditions which they presuppose; but it set the example of not treating those conditions as final. The economic generalisations which depend, not on necessities of nature but on those combined with the existing arrangements of society, it deals with only as provisional, and as liable to be much altered by the progress of social improvement. I had indeed partially learnt this view of things from the thoughts awakened in me by the speculations of the Saint- Simonians8; but it was made a living principle pervading and animating the book by my wife’s promptings. This example illustrates well the general character of what she contributed to my writings. What was abstract and purely scientific was generally mine; the properly human element came from her: in all that concerned the application of philosophy to the exigencies of human society and progress, I was her pupil, alike in boldness of speculation and cautiousness of practical judgment. For, on the one hand, she was much more courageous and far-sighted than without her I should have been, in anticipations of an order of things to come, in which many of the limited generalizations now so often confounded with universal principles will cease to be applicable. Those parts of my writings, and especially of the Political Economy which contemplate possibilities in the future such as, when affirmed by socialists, have in general been fiercely denied by political economists, would, but for her, either have been absent, or the suggestions would have been made much more timidly and in a more qualified form. But while she thus rendered me bolder in speculation on human affairs, her practical turn of mind, and her almost unerring estimate of practical obstacles, repressed in me all tendencies that were really visionary. Her mind invested all ideas in a concrete shape, and formed to itself a conception of how they would actually work: and her knowledge of the existing feelings and conduct of mankind was so seldom at fault, that the weak point in any unworkable suggestion seldom escaped her. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">The Liberty was more directly and literally our joint production than anything else which bears my name, for there was not a sentence of it that was not several times gone through by us together, turned over in many ways, and carefully weeded of any faults, either in thought or expression, that we detected in it. It is in consequence of this that, although it never underwent her final revision, it far surpasses, as a mere specimen of composition, anything which has proceeded from me either before or since. With regard to the thoughts, it is difficult to identify any particular part or element as being more hers than all the rest. The whole mode of thinking of which the book was the expression, was emphatically hers. But I also was so thoroughly imbued with it that the same thoughts naturally occurred to us both. That I was thus penetrated with it, however, I owe in a great degree to her. There was a moment in my mental progress when I might easily have fallen into a tendency towards over-government, both social and political; as there was also a moment when, by reaction from a contrary excess, I might have become a less thorough radical and democrat than I am. In both these points as in many others, she benefitted me as much by keeping me right where I was right, as by leading me to new truths and ridding me of errors. My great readiness and eagerness to learn from everybody, and to make room in my opinions for every new acquisition by adjusting the old and the new to one another, might, but for her steadying influence, have seduced me into modifying my early opinions too much. She was in nothing more valuable to my mental development than by her just measure of the relative importance of different considerations, which often protected me from allowing to truths I had only recently learnt to see, a more important place in my thoughts than was properly their due. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >《论自由》可能比我的其他作品（或许《逻辑学体系》除外）更有生命力，因为我和她思想的结合让这本书成为某种单一真理的哲学教材，这个真理随着现代社会不断发生的变革变得更加突出：说明了性格类型多样化对人类和社会的重要性，给人性向无数的、相冲突的方向发展以充分的自由。这本书的论述所形成的深刻印象比其他任何事物都更好地说明了这个真理的基础有多深厚，尽管当时从表面看来似乎没有必要上这样一课。我们担心社会公正和代表舆论的政府不可避免的发展会给人类套上言论和行动一致的枷锁，对那些只看目前现实而忽视未来趋势的人来说，这种担心看起来似乎只是空想。因为在社会和制度中逐渐发生的变革还远未对新见解的发展绝对有利，使这些新见解获得比从前更多的公正的倾听。但这是属于过渡期的一个特点，此时的旧观念和旧情感已经动摇，而新学说还没有取得优势。在这样的时刻，所有有思想活动的人放弃了旧的信仰，还不确定他们所保留的东西是否会改变，所以他们迫切地倾听新的见解。但这种状态必定是暂时的：某个特定学说体系会适时地得到周围大多数人的支持，建立与之相符的社会制度和行为方式，通过教育使新一代人牢记新的教条，而不用告诉他们得出这个新教条的思想过程，渐渐地这个教条取得了与它所取代的教条相同的压制力。这种有害的力量是否会发挥作用取决于人类在那时是否意识到它会阻碍人性的发展。只有到那时，《论自由》的教导才会有最大的价值。令人担心的是，这些教导在很长时间都会保留这种价值。</td>
		<td class="en">The Liberty is likely to survive longer than anything else that I have written (with the possible exception of the Logic), because the conjunction of her mind with mine has rendered it a kind of philosophic text-book of a single truth, which the changes progressively taking place in modern society tend to bring out into ever stronger relief: the importance, to man and society, of a large variety in types of character, and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself in innumerable and conflicting directions. Nothing can better show how deep are the foundations of this truth, than the great impression made by the exposition of it at a time which, to superficial observation, did not seem to stand much in need of such a lesson. The fears we expressed lest the inevitable growth of social equality and of the government of public opinion should impose on mankind an oppressive yoke of uniformity in opinion and practice, might easily have appeared chimerical to those who looked more at present facts than at tendencies; for the gradual revolution that is taking place in society and institutions has thus far been decidedly favourable to the development of new opinions, and has procured for them a much more unprejudiced hearing than they previously met with. But this is a feature belonging to periods of transition, when old notions and feelings have been unsettled and no new doctrines have yet succeeded to their ascendancy. At such times people of any mental activity, having given up many of their old beliefs, and not feeling quite sure that those they still retain can stand unmodified, listen eagerly to new opinions. But this state of things is necessarily transitory: some particular body of doctrine in time rallies the majority round it, organizes social institutions and modes of action conformably to itself, education impresses this new creed upon the new generations without the mental processes that have led to it, and by degrees it acquires the very same power of compression, so long exercised by the creeds of which it has taken the place. Whether this noxious power will be exercised depends on whether mankind have by that time become aware that it cannot be exercised without stunting and dwarfing human nature. It is then that the teachings of the Liberty will have their greatest value. And it is to be feared that they will retain that value a long time. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于原创性问题，当然它正是每个有思想的人以自己的方式来构想和表达属于人类共同属性的真理。这本书的主导思想是，虽然在很多时代只有孤立的思想家才有这种思想，但它自人类文明开始以来就很可能已经存在了。仅仅拿最近几代人来说，这种思想明显地存在于与教育、文化相关的重要思想中，并通过裴斯泰洛齐的努力传播到欧洲人的心中。书中提到威廉·冯·洪堡无条件地支持这种思想，他在自己的国家绝不是孤立无援。在本世纪初，个人权利学说以及道德应自行发展的主张被德国作家的整个流派推广到了夸张的地步。德国最著名的作家歌德的作品虽然不属于任何一个学派，但却渗透着人生的道德观和处事观，我认为虽然不应当拥护，但它在不停地为自我发展的权利和义务的理论寻求自身可容许的各种辩护。在我们自己的国家，在《论自由》写完之前，威廉·麦考尔先生在一系列作品中以雄辩的方式狂热地维护个人主义理论，让人想起了菲希特，其中最详尽的一部题为《个人主义的要素》。另外，一位杰出的美国人沃伦先生以个人主权为基础建构了一种社会体系，赢得了许多追随者，并着手将建立村庄团体付诸行动（我不知道它现在是否存在），虽然这表面上和社会主义者的一些计划相似，但在原则上与他们完全相反，因为除了推行所有个人具有平等的发展自由，它不承认社会对个人有任何权威。我对自己署名的《论自由》一书中的学说没有原创权，也不打算书写它们的历史，在我之前唯一值得一提的坚持这些理论的作家是洪堡特。他为此书题了词，虽然书中有一段中的词语个人主权是我从沃伦派那里借用的。我提到的前人对这个学说的概念在细节上与我书中提到的概念有天壤之别，在这里没必要赘述。</td>
		<td class="en">As regards originality, it has of course no other than that which every thoughtful mind gives to its own mode of conceiving and expressing truths which are common property. The leading thought of the book is one which, though in many ages confined to insulated thinkers, mankind have probably at no time since the beginning of civilisation been entirely without. To speak only of the last few generations, it is distinctly contained in the vein of important thought respecting education and culture spread through the European mind by the labours and genius of Pestalozzi9. The unqualified championship of it by Wilhelm von Humboldt10 is referred to in the book; but he by no means stood alone in his own country. During the early part of the present century, the doctrine of the rights of individuality, and the claim of the moral nature to develope itself in its own way, was pushed by a whole school of German authors even to exaggeration; and the writings of Goethe, the most celebrated of all German authors, though not belonging to that or to any other school, are penetrated throughout by views of morals and of conduct in life, often in my opinion not defensible, but which are incessantly seeking whatever defence they admit of in the theory of the right and duty of self-development. In our own country, before the book On Liberty was written, the doctrine of Individuality had been enthusiastically asserted, in a stile of vigorous declamation sometimes reminding one of Fichte, by Mr. William Maccall, in a series of writings of which the most elaborate is entitled Elements of Individualism. And a remarkable American, Mr. Warren11, had framed a System of Society, on the foundation of the Sovereignty of the Individual, had obtained a number of followers, and had actually commenced the formation of a Village Community (whether it now exists I know not) which, though bearing a superficial resemblance to some of the projects of Socialists, is diametrically opposite to them in principle, since it recognises no authority whatever in Society over the individual, except to enforce equal freedom of development for all individualities. As the book which bears my name claimed no originality for any of its doctrines, and was not intended to write their history, the only author who had preceded me in their assertion, of whom I thought it appropriate to say anything, was Humboldt, who furnished the motto to the work; although in one passage I borrowed from the Warrenites their phrase, the sovereignty of the individual. It is hardly necessary here to remark that there are abundant differences in detail, between the conception of the doctrine by any of the predecessors I have mentioned, and that set forth in the book. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">The political circumstances of the time induced me shortly after to complete and publish a pamphlet (Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform), part of which had been written some years previously on the occasion of one of the abortive Reform Bills and had at the time been approved and revised by her. Its principal features were, hostility to the Ballot (a change of opinion in both of us, in which she rather preceded me) and a claim of representation for minorities; not however at that time going beyond the cumulative vote proposed by Mr. Garth Marshall12. In finishing the pamphlet for publication with a view to the discussions on the Reform Bill of Lord Derby’s and Mr. Disraeli13’s Government in 1859. I added a third feature, a plurality of votes, to be given, not to property, but to proved superiority of education. This recommended itself to me, as a means of reconciling the irresistible claim of every man or woman to be consulted, and to be allowed a voice, in the regulation of affairs which vitally concern them, with the superiority of weight justly due to opinions grounded on superiority of knowledge. The suggestion, however, was one which I had never discussed with my almost infallible counsellor, and I have no evidence that she would have concurred in it. As far as I have been able to observe, it has found favour with nobody; all who desire any sort of inequality in the electoral vote, desiring it in favour of property and not of intelligence or knowledge. If it ever overcomes the strong feeling which exists against it, this will only be after the establishment of a systematic National Education by which the various grades of politically valuable acquirement may be accurately defined and authenticated. Without this it will always remain liable to strong, possibly conclusive, objections; and with this, it would perhaps not be needed. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >《议会改革的思考》出版后不久，我接触了黑尔先生令人敬佩的《个人代表制》一书，当时还是第一次出版。从这本书中我看到了非常实际和有哲理的思想，以及代议制政府制度所能容许的最大改良。改良以最恰当的方式刚好弥补了代议制以前似乎固有的重大缺陷，这种缺陷就是把所有权力赋予多数派，而不只是按得票数比例分配权力，使最强大的党派排除所有较弱小的党派，不让他们在全民议会上发表见解，除非通过不同地区偶尔不平等分配得到的机会，他们的政见才能得以发表。对于这些重大缺陷似乎不可能找到很完美的缓和剂，但黑尔先生的制度提供了根治的良方。这个政治艺术上的伟大发现激励了我，我也相信它曾经激励了所有接纳它的有思想的人，它给人类社会的前景带来了新的更加乐观的希望，把整个文明世界显然势必遵从的政治制度形式，从看起来限制它或怀疑它的最终利益的主要部分中解放出来。少数派只要还是少数派，就会，也应该会在票数上落后。但规定投票者的集会达到一定数量时，可以自己选出一个代表进入立法机关，少数派就不会被压制。独立的见解将强行进入国民议会，让其他人听到，这种情况在现有的代议民主制度下不是经常发生的。立法机关不再排除个人特性，不再完全由那些代表强大政党或宗教派别教义的人组成，而是包含了国内大部分最优秀的个人，他们进入立法机关与党派无关，而是选民欣赏他们的个人才华。我可以理解，那些在其他方面聪明的人由于缺少充分的考察，会被他们所认为的制度复杂的本性排除在黑尔的方案之外。但任何觉得不需要黑尔方案弥补缺陷的人，任何仅仅把它视为理论上的微妙想法或怪念头的人，任何认为它无助于有价值的目标，不值得引起务实的人注意的人，都可谓是一个不称职的政治家，不能胜任未来的政治。我的意思是，除非他是大臣，或者向往成为大臣的人。因为我们已经习惯于大臣对改良一贯无条件的敌视，几乎要等到他的良知或利益驱使他采纳它作为一项公共措施并且执行它的那一天为止。</td>
		<td class="en">It was soon after the publication of Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform that I became acquainted with Mr. Hare’s admirable system of Personal Representation, which, in its present shape, was then for the first time published. I saw in this great practical and philosophical idea, the greatest improvement of which the system of representative government is susceptible; an improvement which, in the most felicitous manner, exactly meets and cures the grand, and what before seemed the inherent, defect of the representative system; that of giving to a numerical majority all power, instead of only a power proportional to its numbers, and enabling the strongest party to exclude all weaker parties from making their opinions heard in the assembly of the nation, except through such opportunity as may be given to them by the accidentally unequal distribution of opinions in different localities. To these great evils nothing more than very imperfect palliatives had seemed possible; but Mr. Hare’s system affords a radical cure. This great discovery, for it is no less, in the political art, inspired me, as I believe it has inspired all thoughtful persons who have adopted it, with new and more sanguine hopes respecting the prospects of human society; by freeing the form of political institutions towards which the whole civilized world is manifestly and irresistibly tending, from the chief part of what seemed to qualify, or render doubtful, its ultimate benefits. Minorities, so long as they remain minorities, are, and ought to be, outvoted; but under arrangements which enable any assemblage of voters, amounting to a certain number, to place in the legislature, a representative of its own choice, minorities cannot be suppressed. Independent opinions will force their way into the council of the nation and make themselves heard there, a thing which often cannot happen in the existing forms of representative democracy; and the legislature, instead of being weeded of individual peculiarities and entirely made up of men who simply represent the creed of great political or religious parties, will comprise a large proportion of the most eminent individual minds in the country, placed there, without reference to party, by voters who appreciate their individual eminence. I can understand that persons, otherwise intelligent, should, for want of sufficient examination, be repelled from Mr. Hare’s plan by what they think the complex nature of its machinery. But any one who does not feel the want which the scheme is intended to supply; any one who throws it over as a mere theoretical subtlety or crotchet, tending to no valuable purpose, and unworthy of the attention of practical men, may be pronounced an incompetent statesman, unequal to the politics of the future. I mean, unless he is a minister, or aspires to become one: for we are quite accustomed to a minister’s continuing to profess unqualified hostility to an improvement almost to the very day when his conscience, or his interest, induces him to take it up as a public measure, and carry it. </td></tr>

The selection had been made during my wife’s lifetime, but the revision, in concert with her, with a view to republication, had been barely commenced; and when I had no longer the guidance of her judgment I despaired of pursuing it further, and republished the papers as they were, with the exception of striking out such passages as were no longer in accordance with my opinions. My literary work of the year terminated with an essay in Fraser’s Magazine (afterwards republished in the third volume of Dissertations and Discussions) entitled “A Few Words on Non-Intervention”. I was prompted to write this paper by a desire, while vindicating England from the imputations commonly brought against her on the Continent, of a peculiar selfishness in matters of foreign policy, to warn Englishmen of the colour given to this imputation by the low tone in which English statesmen are accustomed to speak of English policy as concerned only with English interests, and by the conduct of Lord Palmerston at that particular time in opposing the Suez Canal. And I took the opportunity of expressing ideas which had long been in my mind (some of them generated by my Indian experience, and others by the international questions which then greatly occupied the European public), respecting the true principles of international morality, and the legitimate modifications made in it by difference of times and circumstances; a subject I had already, to some extent, discussed in the vindication of the French Provisional Government of 1848 against the attacks of Lord Brougham and others, which I published at the time in the Westminster Review, and which is reprinted in the Dissertations. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I had now settled, as I believed, for the remainder of my existence into a purely literary life; if that can be called literary which continued to be occupied in a pre-eminent degree with politics, and not merely with theoretical, but practical politics, although a great part of the year was spent at a distance of many hundred miles from the chief seat of the politics of my own country, to which, and primarily for which, I wrote. But, in truth, the modern facilities of communication have not only removed all the disadvantages, to a political writer in tolerably easy circumstances, of distance from the scene of political action, but have converted them into advantages. The immediate and regular receipt of newspapers and periodicals keeps him au courant of even the most temporary politics, and gives him a much more correct view of the state and progress of opinion than he could acquire by personal contact with individuals: for every one’s social intercourse is more or less limited to particular sets or classes, whose impressions and no others reach him through that channel; and experience has taught me that those who give their time to the absorbing claims of what is called society, not having leisure to keep up a large acquaintance with the organs of opinion, remain much more ignorant of the general state either of the public mind, or of the active and instructed part of it, than a recluse who reads the newspapers need be. There are, no doubt, disadvantages in too long a separation from one’s country—in not occasionally renewing one’s impressions of the light in which men and things appear when seen from a position in the midst of them; but the deliberate judgment formed at a distance, and undisturbed by inequalities of perspective, is the most to be depended on, even for application to practice. Alternating between the two positions I combined the advantages of both. And, though the inspirer of my best thoughts was no longer with me, I was not alone: she had left a daughter, my step-daughter, Miss Helen Taylor, the inheritor of much of her wisdom, and of all her nobleness of character, whose ever growing and ripening talents from that day to this have been devoted to the same great purposes, and have already made her name better and more widely known than was that of her mother, though far less so than I predict that if she lives, it is destined to become. Of the value of her direct cooperation with me, something will be said hereafter: of what I owe in the way of instruction to her great powers of original thought and soundness of practical judgment, it would be a vain attempt to give an adequate idea. Surely no one ever before was so fortunate, as, after such a loss as mine, to draw another such prize in the lottery of life—another companion, stimulator, adviser, and instructor of the rarest quality. Whoever, either now or hereafter, may think of me and of the work I have done, must never forget that it is the product not of one intellect and conscience but of three, the least considerable of whom, and above all the least original, is the one whose name is attached to it. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">The work of the years 1860 and 1861 consisted chiefly of two treatises, only one of which was intended for immediate publication. This was the Considerations on Representative Government, a connected exposition of what, by the thoughts of many years, I had come to regard as the best form of a popular constitution. Along with as much of the general theory of government as is necessary to support this particular portion of its practice, the volume contains my matured views of the principal questions which occupy the present age, within the province of purely organic institutions, and raises by anticipation, some other questions to which growing necessities will sooner or later compel the attention both of theoretical and of practical politicians. The chief of these last, is the distinction between the function of making laws, for which a numerous popular assembly is radically unfit, and that of getting good laws made, which is its proper duty, and cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled by any other authority: and the consequent need of a Legislative Commission, as a permanent part of the constitution of a free country; consisting of a small number of highly trained political minds, on whom, when Parliament has determined that a law shall be made, the task of making it should be devolved; Parliament retaining the power of passing or rejecting the bill when drawn up, but not of altering it otherwise than by sending proposed amendments to be dealt with by the Commission. The question here raised respecting the most important of all public functions, that of legislation, is a particular case of the great problem of modern political organization, stated, I believe, for the first time in its full extent by Bentham, though in my opinion not always satisfactorily resolved by him; the combination of complete popular control over public affairs, with the greatest attainable perfection of skilled agency.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但在此之前，由于美国内战爆发，公共事态就变得十分紧张。我最强烈的感情也投入到这场战争中，我从一开始就认为无论结果是好是坏，这在一段不确定时间内将注定是人类历史的一个转折点。在南北公开分裂前的那些年，我一直很有兴趣地观察美国的奴隶制之争，我知道在斗争的每个阶段，奴隶主都咄咄逼人地想要扩大奴隶制的领域，这主要是受到金钱利益、作威作福的特性和追求阶级特权的阶级狂热三者的共同影响。我的朋友凯恩斯教授在他的优秀作品《奴隶劳力》中充分有力地描述了这种影响。如果奴隶主成功了，那就代表了邪恶力量的胜利，将会助长进步的敌人，压制整个文明世界中进步精神的朋友，以最坏、最反社会的人压迫人的专制形式为基础，形成一股强大的军事力量，并且在很长时间内毁灭伟大的民主共和制的声誉，这会给欧洲所有特权阶级一个错误的信心，这种信心很可能只有在血泊中才会消失。另一种可能是，如果北方的士气足够高涨，最后成功赢得战争，如果这个胜利来得不是太快且不太容易，从人性的法则和革命经验来看，我预见这种胜利一旦来了就很可能是彻底的。然而北方民众的良知到那时仅仅止步于意识到抵制奴隶制的进一步扩展。他们对美国宪法的忠诚使他们反对联邦政府干涉各个蓄奴州的奴隶制，但当宪法受到武装叛乱的动摇时，他们又会产生另一种感情，并下决心永远去除那个可恶的东西，加入到高尚的废奴主义者麾下，后者认为加里森是勇敢和忠心的传道者，温德尔·菲利普斯是雄辩的演说家，约翰·布朗是自发的殉难者。到那时，所有美国人的思想将从枷锁中解放出来，不再受到那种假想的必要的腐蚀，以为必须为对其宪法中自由原则最骇人听闻的违背而向外国人道歉。当一个社会停滞的状态趋于墨守成规时，国民思想至少将暂时阻止这种趋势，而全民思想将变得更容易认识到制度中或人民习惯中坏的东西。目前关于奴隶制的这些希望已经全部实现，在其他方面也在逐步实现。从叛乱的成功或失败两种结局的预测中，可以想象当我国几乎全部中上层阶级，甚至那些被认为是“自由派”的人都一窝蜂地成为支持南方派的狂热伙伴时，我会带着怎样的感情来思索。工人阶级，还有一些文学、科学领域的人，几乎成为这场全民狂热的唯一例外。我之前从未如此强烈地感觉到永久进步在有权阶级身上起效多么小，而他们习惯声称的那些自由理念的价值又是多么小。欧洲大陆的自由派从未犯过同样可怕的错误。但那个逼迫我们西印度种植园主解放黑人奴隶的一代已经一去不复返。其后的一代没有经过多年的讨论和揭露，所以不能强烈地感觉到奴隶制的罪大恶极。而英国人习惯于对发生在他们国土之外的世事不闻不问，这使他们对这场战争的前因毫不知情，以至于在战争开始的头一两年他们还不相信这是一场关于奴隶制的斗争。那些道德准则高尚，观点开通的人认为，这场战争是关税之争，或者把它同化成他们一直同情的民族争取独立的战争。</td>
		<td class="en">Before this, however, the state of public affairs had become extremely critical, by the commencement of the American civil war. My strongest feelings were engaged in this struggle, which, I felt from the beginning, was destined to be a turning point, for good or evil, of the course of human affairs for an indefinite duration. Having been a deeply interested observer of the slavery quarrel in America, during the many years that preceded the open breach, I knew that it was in all its stages an aggressive enterprise of the slave-owners to extend the territory of slavery; under the combined influences of pecuniary interest, domineering temper, and the fanaticism of a class for its class privileges, influences so fully and powerfully depicted in the admirable work of my friend Professor Cairnes15, The Slave Power. Their success, if they succeeded, would be a victory of the powers of evil which would give courage to the enemies of progress and damp the spirits of its friends all over the civilised world, while it would create a formidable military power, grounded on the worst and most antisocial form of the tyranny of men over men, and, by destroying for a long time the prestige of the great democratic republic, would give to all the privileged classes of Europe a false confidence, probably only to be extinguished in blood. On the other hand, if the spirit of the North was sufficiently roused to carry the war to a successful termination, and if that termination did not come too soon and too easily, I foresaw, from the laws of human nature, and the experience of revolutions, that when it did come it would in all probability be thorough: that the bulk of the Northern population, whose conscience had as yet been awakened only to the point of resisting the further extension of slavery, but whose fidelity to the Constitution of the United States made them disapprove of any attempt by the Federal Government to interfere with slavery in the States where it already existed, would acquire feelings of another kind when the Constitution had been shaken off by armed rebellion, would determine to have done for ever with the accursed thing, and would join their banner with that of the noble body of Abolitionists, of whom Garrison was the courageous and single-minded apostle, Wendell Phillips16 the eloquent orator, and John Brown the voluntary martyr. Then, too, the whole mind of the United States would be let loose from its bonds, no longer corrupted by the supposed necessity of apologising to foreigners for the most flagrant of all possible violations of the free principles of their Constitution; while the tendency of a fixed state of society to stereotype a set of national opinions would be at least temporarily checked, and the national mind would become more open to the recognition of whatever was bad in either the institutions or the customs of the people. These hopes, so far as related to slavery, have been completely, and in other respects are in course of being progressively realized. Foreseeing from the first this double set of consequences from the success or failure of the rebellion, it may be imagined with what feelings I contemplated the rush of nearly the whole upper and middle classes of my own country, even those who passed for Liberals, into a furious pro-Southern partisanship: the working classes, and some of the literary and scientific men, being almost the sole exceptions to the general frenzy. I never before felt so keenly how little permanent improvement had reached the minds of our influential classes, and of what small value were the liberal opinions they had got into the habit of professing. None of the Continental Liberals committed the same frightful mistake. But the generation which had extorted negro emancipation from our West India planters had passed away; another had succeeded which had not learnt by many years of discussion and exposure to feel strongly the enormities of slavery; and the inattention habitual with Englishmen to whatever is going on in the world outside their own island, made them profoundly ignorant of all the antecedents of the struggle, insomuch that it was not generally believed in England, for the first year or two of the war, that the quarrel was one of slavery. There were men of high principle and unquestionable liberality of opinion, who thought it a dispute about tariffs, or assimilated it to the cases in which they were accustomed to sympathise, of a people struggling for independence. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >显然，我有义务和少数人一起反对这种反常的舆论。我不是第一个提出抗议的人。应当记住这是休斯先生和勒德洛先生的功劳，通过在斗争刚开始时发表作品来提出抗议。紧接着布赖特先生用一篇最强有力的演说表示抗议，后续者的表现也同样精彩。临近1861年年底时，美国的一名军官在英国的船上抓住了南方的使节，就在这时我以自己的文章加入了他们的行列。即使健忘的英国人也不会这么快忘记，当时英国迸发出了一股持续数周，期盼与美国并肩作战的情感洪流，事实上英国这边还进行了作战准备。当这种状态持续时，英国人就没有机会听到任何有利于美国事业的声音，另外，我赞同那些认为这个行动不合理的人，以至于要求英国应当拒绝参战。后来英国拒绝参战，战争的警报才告解除。我于1862年1月在《弗雷泽杂志》上发表了一篇文章，题为《美国之争》。我一直感谢我的女儿敦促我写成这篇文章，因为我们当时正要出发去希腊和土耳其旅行几个月，要不是因为她，我本会推迟到回来后再写。文章写成并发表，它有助于鼓励那些感觉被狭隘观点压制的自由派人士，也有助于形成有利于正义事业的思想核心，这个核心在慢慢发展，并会在北方有望胜利后迅速发展起来。我们旅行回来后，我又写了另一篇评论凯恩斯教授著作的文章，发表在《威斯敏斯特评论》上。英国统治阶级希望美国这个国家毁灭，这激起了美国长期的怨恨，英国也因此受到了许多令之不快的惩罚。他们有理由感谢那一小部分的——哪怕只有一小部分的——知名作家、演说家在他们最困难的时候坚定地站在美国人这边，部分转移了他们的痛恨情绪，使大不列颠在美国人眼中不是完全丑恶的。</td>
		<td class="en">It was my obvious duty to be one of the small minority who protested against this perverted state of public opinion. I was not the first to protest. It ought to be remembered to the honour of Mr. Hughes and of Mr. Ludlow, that they, by writings published at the very beginning of the struggle, began the protestation. Mr. Bright17 followed in one of the most powerful of his speeches, followed by others not less striking. I was on the point of adding my words to theirs, when there occurred, towards the end of 1861, the seizure of the Southern envoys on board a British vessel, by an officer of the United States. Even English forgetfulness has not yet had time to lose all remembrance of the explosion of feeling in England which then burst forth, the expectation, which prevailed for some weeks, of war with the United States, and the warlike preparations actually commenced on this side. While this state of things lasted, there was no chance of a hearing for anything favourable to the American cause; and, moreover, I agreed with those who thought the act unjustifiable and such as to require that England should demand its disavowal. When the disavowal came, and the alarm of war was over, I wrote, in January, 1862, the paper, in Fraser’s Magazine, entitled “The Contest in America”. And I shall always feel grateful to my daughter that her urgency prevailed on me to write it when I did: for we were then on the point of setting out for a journey of some months in Greece and Turkey, and but for her, I should have deferred writing till our return. Written and published when it was, this paper helped to encourage those Liberals who had felt overborne by the tide of illiberal opinion, and to form in favour of the good cause a nucleus of opinion which increased gradually, and, after the success of the North began to seem probable, rapidly. When we returned from our journey I wrote a second article, a review of Professor Cairnes’ book, published in the Westminster Review. England is paying the penalty, in many uncomfortable ways, of the durable resentment which her ruling classes stirred up in the United States by their ostentatious wishes for the ruin of America as a nation: they have reason to be thankful that a few, if only a few, known writers and speakers, standing firmly by the Americans in the time of their greatest difficulty, effected a partial diversion of these bitter feelings, and made Great Britain not altogether odious to the Americans. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >完成了这个义务后，我接下来两年中的主要工作与政治无关。奥斯汀先生的遗著《法理学演说集》使我有机会向他表示应有的怀念，同时在许多问题上发表我的想法，之前在我信奉边沁主义的时候曾经对这些问题有过研究。但那些年的主要成果是《威廉·汉密尔顿爵士哲学研究》，他的《演说集》于1860—1861年间出版，我在1861年底读到这本书时就打算在某期《威斯敏斯特评论》上对这些演说进行阐述，但很快我就发现这样是偷懒的做法，要想公正地评价这本书起码要写一卷书才行。于是我考虑自己尝试这样做是否可取。考虑过后，我似乎有充分的理由去这样做。我对《演说集》十分失望，当然我读它的时候对威廉·汉密尔顿爵士并没有偏见。在那之前，因为《里德论》还没有完成，所以我推迟了对它的研究，但我也留意了他的《哲学讨论》，虽然我知道他论述精神哲学的总体方式与我最推崇的方式不同，但他反对后期先验主义者的有力辩论和对一些重要原则的极力支持，尤其是对人类知识相对性的坚持，使我和他在思想上产生共鸣，感到在他的权威和声誉影响下，真正的心理学得到的比失去的要多。他的《演说集》和《里德论》打破了这样的幻想：即使是《哲学讨论》，如果带着这种理解来读，也会失去很多价值。我发现我和他的观点明显一致的地方很多都是在书面上的，在实践上的却很少。那些他认同的重要哲学原理已经被他解释得几乎没有意义或毫无意义了，或者意义慢慢消失掉了，而与这些原理完全矛盾的学说却几乎在他哲学作品中的每个部分都得到了讲解。所以到目前为止，我对他的评价改变了，不再认为他占据了两个对立哲学的中间位置，掌握两者的原理并且为相互攻守提供有力的武器。我现在把他视为支柱之一，在这个国家以他的高度哲学声望来讲是一根主要的支柱，而且在我看来是两根当中错误的一根。</td>
		<td class="en">This duty having been performed, my principal occupation for the next two years was on subjects not political. The publication of Mr. Austin’s Lectures on Jurisprudence after his decease, gave me an opportunity of paying a deserved tribute to his memory, and at the same time expressing some thoughts on a subject on which, in my old days of Benthamism, I had bestowed much study. But the chief product of those years was the Examination of Sir William Hamilton18’s Philosophy. His Lectures, published in 1860 and 1861, I had read towards the end of the latter year, with a half-formed intention of giving an account of them in a Review, but I soon found that this would be idle, and that justice could not be done to the subject in less than a volume. I had then to consider whether it would be advisable that I myself should attempt such a performance. On consideration, there seemed to be strong reasons for doing so. I was greatly disappointed with the Lectures. I read them, certainly, with no prejudice against Sir William Hamilton. I had up to that time deferred the study of his Notes to Reid on account of their unfinished state, but I had not neglected his Discussions in Philosophy; and though I knew that his general mode of treating the facts of mental philosophy differed from that of which I most approved, yet his vigorous polemic against the later Transcendentalists, and his strenuous assertion of some important principles, especially the Relativity of human knowledge, gave me many points of sympathy with his opinions, and made me think that genuine psychology had considerably more to gain than to lose by his authority and reputation. His Lectures and the Dissertations on Reid dispelled this illusion: and even the Discussions, read by the light which these threw on them, lost much of their value. I found that the points of apparent agreement between his opinions and mine were more verbal than real; that the important philosophical principles which I had thought he recognised, were so explained away by him as to mean little or nothing, or were continually lost sight of, and doctrines entirely inconsistent with them were taught in nearly every part of his philosophical writings. My estimation of him was therefore so far altered, that instead of regarding him as occupying a kind of intermediate position between the two rival philosophies, holding some of the principles of both, and supplying to both powerful weapons of attack and defence, I now looked upon him as one of the pillars, and in this country from his high philosophical reputation the chief pillar, of that one of the two which seemed to me to be erroneous. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，哲学两大学派——直觉派和经验联想派之间的区别不仅仅是抽象思考的问题，而是带有实际的后果，造成了进步时代中所有实际观念间的巨大差别。务实的改革者一直坚持在那些有强烈和广泛感情支撑的事物中进行改革，或者一直质疑既成事实的表面必要性和不可取消性。他的论据中一个不可缺少的部分就是，这些强大的感情从哪里来，这些事实为何看起来是必要的和不可取消的。因此，在他和哲学之间存在自然的敌对状态，因为哲学反对通过环境和联想来解释感情和道德事实，而将其视为人性的终极要素。哲学坚持支持受欢迎的学说作为直觉真理，认为直觉是大自然和神的声音，其话语的权威性高于理性。尤其是我早就感觉到一种普遍的倾向，即把所有人性明显的差异视为天生的，而且基本上是不能消除的，但却忽略了无可争议的证据，那就是到目前为止，无论是个人、种族还是性别间的差异，绝大部分不仅可能是，而且自然是由环境的不同造成的。这是理性对待重大社会问题的主要障碍，也是人类进步的最大绊脚石之一。这种倾向根源于直觉形而上学，以19世纪对18世纪的抗拒为特征，它总体上符合人类的惰性和保守利益，除非从根源下手，否则它肯定大大超过较温和形式的直觉哲学能真正证明其为正当的程度。然而哲学的形式不是一直温和的，它在一个世纪的大部分时间里统治了欧洲的思想。我父亲的《人类心灵现象的分析》，我的《逻辑学体系》和贝恩教授的伟大著作都试图重新介绍一种更好的研究哲学的方式，后来我们取得了预想的成功。但是，有一段时间我认为仅仅对比两个哲学派别是不够的，应当让它们短兵相接，需要有争议和论述的作品，然后这种争议方才有用。考虑到威廉·汉密尔顿爵士的作品和声誉是这个国家直觉派的重要堡垒，因为他令人印象深刻的性格，和方方面面的突出优点，以及思想的天赋令这个堡垒更加坚不可摧。我认为，彻底考察他所有最重要的学说和评估他作为一个哲学家对崇高的一般主张，对哲学或许是一种真正的贡献。通过观察威廉·汉密尔顿爵士的追随者，且是最有才能的追随者之一的作品，我更坚定了我的想法，他的特殊学说只证明了一个我认为最不道德的宗教观点的正当性，即在神的面前屈膝朝拜是我们的义务，而神的道德属性被证明是不可知的，或许完全不同于我们谈论人类时用同样名称所表示的道德属性。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, the difference between these two schools of philosophy, that of Intuition, and that of Experience and Association, is not a mere matter of abstract speculation; it is full of practical consequences, and lies at the foundation of all the greatest differences of practical opinion in an age of progress. The practical reformer has continually to demand that changes be made in things which are supported by powerful and widely-spread feelings, or to question the apparent necessity and indefeasibleness of established facts; and it is often an indispensable part of his argument to show, how those powerful feelings had their origin, and how those facts came to seem necessary and indefeasible. There is therefore a natural hostility between him and a philosophy which discourages the explanation of feelings and moral facts by circumstances and association, and prefers to treat them as ultimate elements of human nature; a philosophy which is addicted to holding up favourite doctrines as intuitive truths, and deems intuition to be the voice of Nature and of God, speaking with an authority higher than that of our reason. In particular, I have long felt that the prevailing tendency to regard all the marked distinctions of human character as innate, and in the main indelible, and to ignore the irresistible proofs that by far the greater part of those differences, whether between individuals, races, or sexes, are such as not only might but naturally would be produced by differences in circumstances, is one of the chief hindrances to the rational treatment of great social questions and one of the greatest stumbling blocks to human improvement. This tendency has its source in the intuitional metaphysics which characterized the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth, and it is a tendency so agreeable to human indolence, as well as to conservative interests generally, that unless attacked at the very root, it is sure to be carried to even a greater length than is really justified by the more moderate forms of the intuitional philosophy. That philosophy, not always in its moderate forms, had ruled the thought of Europe for the greater part of a century. My father’s Analysis of the Mind, my own Logic, and Professor Bain’s great treatise, had attempted to re-introduce a better mode of philosophizing, latterly with quite as much success as could be expected; but I had for some time felt that the mere contrast of the two philosophies was not enough, that there ought to be a hand-to-hand fight between them, that controversial as well as expository writings were needed, and that the time was come when such controversy would be useful. Considering then the writings and fame of Sir W. Hamilton as the great fortress of the intuitional philosophy in this country, a fortress the more formidable from the imposing character, and the in many respects great personal merits and mental endowments, of the man, I thought it might be a real service to philosophy to attempt a thorough examination of all his most important doctrines, and an estimate of his general claims to eminence as a philosopher, and I was confirmed in this resolution by observing that in the writings of at least one, and him one of the ablest, of Sir W. Hamilton’s followers, his peculiar doctrines were made the justification of a view of religion which I hold to be profoundly immoral—that it is our duty to bow down in worship before a Being whose moral attributes are affirmed to be unknowable by us, and to be perhaps extremely different from those which, when we are speaking of our fellow creatures, we call by the same names. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">As I advanced in my task, the damage to Sir W. Hamilton’s reputation became greater than I at first expected, through the almost incredible multitude of inconsistencies which showed themselves on comparing different passages with one another. It was my business, however, to show things exactly as they were, and I did not flinch from it. I endeavoured always to treat the philosopher whom I criticized with the most scrupulous fairness; and I knew that he had abundance of disciples and admirers to correct me if I ever unintentionally did him injustice. Many of them accordingly have answered me, more or less elaborately; and they have pointed out oversights and misunderstandings, though few in number, and mostly very unimportant in substance. Such of those as had (to my knowledge) been pointed out before the publication of the latest edition (at present the third) have been corrected there, and the remainder of the criticisms have been, as far as seemed necessary, replied to. On the whole, the book has done its work: it has shewn the weak side of Sir W. Hamilton, and has reduced his too great philosophical reputation within more moderate bounds; and by some of its discussions, as well as by two expository chapters, on the notions of Matter and of Mind, it has perhaps thrown additional light on some of the disputed questions in the domain of psychology and metaphysics. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">After the completion of the book on Hamilton, I applied myself to a task which a variety of reasons seemed to render specially incumbent upon me; that of giving an account, and forming an estimate, of the doctrines of Auguste Comte. I had contributed more than any one else to make his speculations known in England. In consequence chiefly of what I had said of him in my Logic, he had readers and admirers among thoughtful men on this side of the Channel at a time when his name had not yet in France, emerged from obscurity. So unknown and unappreciated was he at the time when my Logic was written and published, that to criticise his weak points might well appear superfluous, while it was a duty to give as much publicity as one could to the important contributions he had made to philosophic thought. At the time, however, at which I have now arrived, this state of affairs had entirely changed. His name, at least, was known almost universally, and the general character of his doctrines very widely. He had taken his place in the estimation both of friends and opponents, as one of the conspicuous figures in the thought of the age. The better parts of his speculations had made great progress in working their way into those minds, which, by their previous culture and tendencies, were fitted to receive them: under cover of those better parts those of a worse character, greatly developed and added to in his later writings, had also made some way, having obtained active and enthusiastic adherents, some of them of no inconsiderable personal merit, in England, France, and other countries. These causes not only made it desirable that some one should undertake the task of sifting what is good from what is bad in M. Comte’s speculations, but seemed to impose on myself in particular a special obligation to make the attempt. This I accordingly did in two essays, published in successive numbers of the Westminster Review, and reprinted in a small volume under the title “Auguste Comte and Positivism”. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">The writings which I have now mentioned, together with a small number of papers in periodicals which I have not deemed worth preserving, were the whole of the products of my activity as a writer during the years from 1859 to 1865. In the early part of the last-mentioned year, in compliance with a wish frequently expressed to me by working men, I published cheap People’s Editions of those of my writings which seemed the most likely to find readers among the working classes; viz. Principles of Political Economy, Liberty, and Representative Government. This was a considerable sacrifice of my pecuniary interest, especially as I resigned all idea of deriving profit from the cheap editions, and after ascertaining from my publishers the lowest price which they thought would remunerate them on the usual terms of an equal division of profits, I gave up my half share to enable the price to be fixed still lower. To the credit of Messrs. Longman they fixed, unasked, a certain number of years after which the copyright and stereotype plates were to revert to me, and a certain number of copies after the sale of which I should receive half of any further profit. This number of copies (which in the case of the Political Economy was 10,000) has for some time been exceeded, and the People’s Editions have begun to yield me a small but unexpected pecuniary return, though very far from an equivalent for the diminution of profit from the Library Editions. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的外部生活概述到这里，之后，我宁静的隐居作家生活转变成与我趣味不那么相投的下院生活。1865年初，威斯敏斯特的一些选民提议我加入议会，这已经不是第一次了，甚至不是我收到的第一份邀请，因为十多年前，由于我对爱尔兰土地问题的见解，卢卡斯先生和达菲先生以爱尔兰一个受欢迎政党的名义，邀请我代表爱尔兰的一个郡加入议会。这对他们来说很容易办到，但当时我在东印度公司任职，无法兼任议员，所以我根本都没有考虑这个提议。后来我离开了东印度公司，很多朋友本可以很高兴地看到我成为议员，但这个想法实现的可能性似乎并不存在。我相信没有任何一个选举团体的多数派或实力派真正愿意让有我这种见解的人当代表。我也深信，一个在当地没有任何关系又不受欢迎的人，一个不想成为政党喉舌的人，除非花费金钱，否则当选的几率很小。过去和现在我都坚信，一个候选人不应当为了担任公职而花费分文。这种合法的选举开支不应当由某个特殊的候选人承担，而应当由国家或当地的公共开支负责。为了使全体选民正确理解候选人的主张，每位候选人的支持者必须做的事应当由不支酬劳的机构，或从自愿捐款中支付。如果选举机构成员或其他人自愿捐款，通过合法途径使某个他们认为在议会中有用的人入选议会，没有人有权反对他们。但是，如果全部或部分的花费都落在候选人头上，则是完全错误的。因为这实际上等同于花钱买席位。即便是对金钱支出作最有利的推测，人们仍可以正当地怀疑那些花钱博取公众信任的人另有企图。选举的成本（最重要的因素）如果由候选人承担，就失去了所有不能或不愿承担这笔巨额费用的人作为议员为国家服务。我并不是说一个独立的候选人不遵从这种卑鄙的方式就几乎没有希望进入议会，如果他的钱不是直接或间接地用于贿赂，他花钱就不总是道德上的错误。但为了证明这一点，他应当十分确定，他当议员比做其他事情对他的国家贡献更大。就我自己而言，我并没有感觉到这种自信。我一点也不清楚，我做议员会比单纯当一个作家更能促进需要我尽力的公共目标的实现。所以我觉得我不应当参选议员，更不应当花钱来谋取议会的席位。</td>
		<td class="en">In this summary of my outward life I have now arrived at the period at which my tranquil and retired existence as a writer of books was to be exchanged for the less congenial occupation of a member of the House of Commons. The proposal made to me early in 1865, by some electors of Westminster, did not present the idea to me for the first time. It was not even the first offer I had received, for, more than ten years previous, in consequence of my opinions on the Irish Land Question, Mr. Lucas and Mr. Duffy, in the name of the popular party in Ireland, offered to bring me into Parliament for an Irish county, which they could easily have done: but the incompatibility of a seat in Parliament with the office I then held in the India House precluded even consideration of the proposal. After I had quitted the India House, several of my friends would gladly have seen me a member of Parliament; but there seemed no probability that the idea would ever take any practical shape. I was convinced that no numerous or influential portion of any electoral body, really wished to be represented by a person of my opinions; and that one who possessed no local connexion or popularity, and who did not choose to stand as the mere organ of a party, had small chance of being elected anywhere unless through the expenditure of money. Now it was, and is, my fixed conviction, that a candidate ought not to incur one farthing of expense for undertaking a public duty. Such of the lawful expenses of an election as have no special reference to any particular candidate, ought to be borne as a public charge, either by the State or by the locality. What has to be done by the supporters of each candidate in order to bring his claims properly before the constituency, should be done by unpaid agency, or by voluntary subscription. If members of the electoral body, or others, are willing to subscribe money of their own for the purpose of bringing by lawful means into Parliament some one who they think would be useful there, no one is entitled to object: but that the expense, or any part of it, should fall on the candidate, is fundamentally wrong; because it amounts, in reality, to buying his seat. Even on the most favourable supposition as to the mode in which the money is expended, there is a legitimate suspicion that any one who gives money for leave to undertake a public trust, has other than public ends to promote by it; and (a consideration of the greatest importance) the cost of elections, when borne by the candidates, deprives the nation of the services, as members of Parliament, of all who cannot or will not afford to incur a heavy expense. I do not say that, so long as there is scarcely a chance for an independent candidate to come into Parliament without complying with this vicious practice, it must always be morally wrong in him to spend money, provided that no part of it is either directly or indirectly employed in corruption. But, to justify it, he ought to be very certain that he can be of more use to his country as a member of Parliament than in any other mode which is open to him; and this assurance, in my own case, I did not feel. It was by no means clear to me that I could do more to advance the public objects which had a claim on my exertions, from the benches of the House of Commons, than from the simple position of a writer. I felt, therefore, that I ought not to seek election to Parliament, much less to expend any money in procuring it. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但当一个选举团把我推选出来，并且自发地推举我做候选人时，情况就完全不同了。假如通过解释他们了解了我的想法，并接受我提出的让我按良心办事的唯一条件后，他们仍坚持这个希望，那么问题就是这是否就是一个选区的选民邀请一个成员当候选人，而他又几乎没有正当理由拒绝的情况。所以我通过一个候选人对他的选举团体作出的最坦率的解释之一来检验他们的意向。在答复他们的邀请时，我写了封公开信，说我个人无意做议员，并且认为一个候选人既不该拉选票，也不该承担任何费用，这两样我都不同意做。我又进一步说到，如果我当选了，我不能保证用我的时间和精力为他们谋取任何地方利益。至于一般政治，我毫无保留地告诉他们我对很多重要问题的想法，他们之前曾征询过我的意见。其中一个是选举权问题，我告诉他们我深信（我有义务这么做，因为我打算一旦当选就照此行事）女性有权在议会中担任代表，享有同男性一样的权利。这对选举人来说无疑是第一次听到这样的说法。提出这个想法后，我当选了议员，这一事实促使主张妇女选举权运动的蓬勃开展。当时，像我这样的职业且行为完全藐视所有正规选举活动的候选人（如果可以这样称呼的话）仍能当选，似乎没有什么比这件事更不可能的了。一个著名的文人，同时也是社交圈中的一员曾说过，按照这样的安排，即便是万能的上帝自己也没有机会当选。我坚持既不花钱也不拉选票，我个人也不参加任何选举活动，一直到提名前的一个星期，我才参加了几个公众集会，表明我的立场，并回答了选举人行使其正当权利将我推举为咨询指导所提出的问题，而我的回答和我的演说一样简单坦率。只有一个问题，即关于我的宗教见解，我从一开始就宣布不回答任何问题。这个决定似乎得到参会者的完全认可。我回答其他问题的坦率态度，明显比我的回答本身更能给我带来好处，因为我无论怎样回答都会造成伤害。在我得到的证据中，有一个特别值得注意，那就是我曾在《议会改革的思考》中直言不讳地说，（英国的）工人阶级虽然不同于其他一些国家的工人阶级羞于说谎，但通常还是说谎者。这段话被我的对手印在标语牌上，并在一个主要由工人阶级组成的会议上递给我，问我是否曾写了并发表了这段话。我立即回答“是的”。话一出口即刻赢得了会场热烈的掌声。显然工人阶级已经习惯了从那些寻求他们选票的人口中听到推诿和借口，所以当他们听到直接公开承认了可能令他们不满的话之后，他们并没有感觉被冒犯，反而立即断定这是一个他们可以信赖的人。我从未听说过那些最懂得工人阶级的人的经历中有比这更惊人的例子。在他们喜欢的优点中最重要的就是彻底的坦诚，坦诚比他们心中十分强烈反对的更重要，没有其他的品质可以弥补坦诚的缺乏。事后第一个发言的工人（奥杰先生）说，工人阶级并不是不希望有人告诉他们自己的过错，他们需要的是朋友，不是奉承者，并且他们会对向他们真诚提出身上需要改进之处的人负有义务，会议对这一点反响热烈。</td>
		<td class="en">But the conditions of the question were considerably altered when a body of electors sought me out, and spontaneously offered to bring me forward as their candidate. If it should appear, on explanation, that they persisted in this wish, knowing my opinions, and accepting the only conditions on which I could conscientiously serve, it was questionable whether this was not one of those calls upon a member of the community by his fellow citizens, which he was scarcely justified in rejecting. I therefore put their disposition to the proof by one of the frankest explanations ever tendered, I should think, to an electoral body by a candidate. I wrote, in reply to the offer, a letter for publication, saying that I had no personal wish to be a member of parliament, that I thought a candidate ought neither to canvass nor to incur any expense, and that I could not consent to do either. I said further, that if elected, I could not undertake to give any of my time and labour to their local interests. With respect to general politics, I told them without reserve, what I thought on a number of important subjects on which they had asked my opinion; and one of these being the suffrage, I made known to them, among other things, my conviction (as I was bound to do, since I intended, if elected, to act on it) that women were entitled to representation in Parliament on the same terms with men. It was the first time, doubtless, that such a doctrine had ever been mentioned to electors; and the fact that I was elected after proposing it, gave the start to the movement which has since become so vigorous in favour of women’s suffrage. Nothing, at the time, appeared more unlikely than that a candidate (if candidate I could be called) whose professions and conduct set so completely at defiance all ordinary notions of electioneering, should nevertheless be elected. A well-known literary man, who was also a man of society, was heard to say, that the Almighty himself would have no chance of being elected on such a programme. I strictly adhered to it, neither spending money nor canvassing, nor did I take any personal part in the election, until about a week preceding the day of nomination, when I attended a few public meetings to state my principles and give answers to any questions which the electors might exercise their just right of putting to me for their own guidance, answers as plain and unreserved as my Address. On one subject only, my religious opinions, I announced from the beginning that I would answer no questions; a determination which appeared to be completely approved by those who attended the meetings. My frankness on all other subjects on which I was interrogated, evidently, did me far more good than my answers, whatever they might be, did harm. Among the proofs I received of this, one is too remarkable not to be recorded. In the pamphlet Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform I had said, rather bluntly, that the working classes, though differing from those of some other countries in being ashamed of lying, are yet generally liars. This passage some opponent got printed in a placard, which was handed to me at a meeting, chiefly composed of the working classes, and I was asked whether I had written and published it. I at once answered “I did”. Scarcely were these two words out of my mouth, when vehement applause resounded through the whole meeting. It was evident that the working people were so accustomed to expect equivocation and evasion from those who sought their suffrages, that when they found, instead of that, a direct avowal of what was likely to be disagreeable to them, instead of being affronted, they concluded at once that this was a person whom they could trust. A more striking instance never came under my notice of what, I believe, is the experience of those who best know the working classes, that the most essential of all recommendations to their favour is that of complete straightforwardness; its presence outweights in their minds very strong objections, while no amount of other qualities will make amends for its apparent absence. The first working man who spoke after the incident I have mentioned (it was Mr. Odger) said, that the working classes had no desire not to be told of their faults; they wanted friends, not flatterers, and felt under obligation to any one who told them of anything in themselves which he sincerely believed to require amendment. And to this the meeting heartily responded. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I was a member of the House during the three sessions of the Parliament which passed the Reform Bill; during which time Parliament was necessarily my main occupation, except during the recess. I was a tolerably frequent speaker, sometimes of prepared speeches, sometimes extemporaneously. But my choice of occasions was not such as I should have made if my leading object had been Parliamentary influence. When I had gained the ear of the House, which I did by a successful speech on Mr. Gladstone’s Reform Bill, the idea I proceeded on was that when anything was likely to be as well done, or sufficiently well done, by other people, there was no necessity for me to meddle with it. As I therefore, in general, reserved myself for work which no others were likely to do, a great proportion of my appearances were on points on which the bulk of the Liberal party, even the advanced portion of it, either were of a different opinion from mine, or were comparatively indifferent. Several of my speeches, especially one against the motion for the abolition of capital punishment, and another in favour of resuming the right of seizing enemies’ goods in neutral vessels, were opposed to what then was, and probably still is, regarded as the advanced liberal opinion. My advocacy of women’s suffrage, and of Personal Representation, were at the time looked upon by many as whims of my own; but the great progress since made by those opinions, and especially the zealous response made from almost all parts of the kingdom to the demand for women’s suffrage, fully justified the timeliness of those movements, and have made what was undertaken as a moral and social duty, a personal success. Another duty which was particularly incumbent on me as one of the Metropolitan Members, was the attempt to obtain a Municipal Government for the Metropolis: but on that subject the indifference of the House of Commons was such that I found hardly any help or support within its walls. On this subject, however, I was the organ of an active and intelligent body of persons outside, with whom and not with me, the scheme originated, who carried on all the agitation on the subject and drew up the Bills. My part was to bring in Bills already prepared, and to sustain the discussion of them during the short time they were allowed to remain before the House; after having taken an active part in the work of a Committee presided over by Mr. Ayrton, which sat through the greater part of the Session of 1866, to take evidence on the subject. The very different position in which the question now stands (1870) may justly be attributed to the preparation which went on during those years, and which produced but little visible effect at the time; but all questions on which there are strong private interests on one side, and only the public good on the other, have a similar period of incubation to go through. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在议会所起的作用是做其他人不能或不愿意做的事情，同样的想法使我想到自己的义务是当先进的自由主义面临指责而议会中大多数进步的自由党人不愿引火烧身时站出来为其辩护。我在议会的第一次投票是支持爱尔兰议员提出的有利于爱尔兰的修正案，包括我在内只有五位英格兰和苏格兰议员投了赞成票，其他四个人是布赖特先生、麦克拉伦先生、T.B.波特先生和哈德菲尔德先生。我的第二次演讲是关于延长爱尔兰人身保护令暂停期限的法案。我在演说中谴责英国统治爱尔兰的方式，我只是做了现在英国舆论普遍承认是公正的事情。但那时反对芬尼亚共和主义的怒潮才刚刚开始，所有攻击芬尼亚组织成员所攻击目标的行为都被看作是对他们的辩护。因此我在议会很不受欢迎，所以不止一个朋友建议我（我自己也同意这个建议）等待《改良法案》的第一次大讨论给出有利的机会后再发表第二次演说。在沉默的期间，许多人自鸣得意地以为我以失败告终，所以不用再因为我而烦恼。或许正是他们贬损的评论所起到的反作用力帮助我对《改良法案》作的演讲大获成功。后来我在一篇演说中坚持认为在我们的煤供应耗尽之前我们有责任还清国债。之后一些托利党领导人引用了我作品中几段对我不利的话，要求我解释另外的几句话，尤其是《代议政府的思考》中说到从构成规律来看保守党是最愚蠢的政党，对此我作出了讥讽的回复。通过以上这两件事，我在议院的地位得到了提高。他们并没有通过让人们注意到这些话而得到好处，以前没有人注意这段话，但之后的很长一段时间内“愚蠢政党”的绰号却与他们如影随形。现在我无需担心没有人听我的演说，我想我过多地限制了自己，只在看起来特别需要我帮助的场合才发表演说，避免过多地谈论重大的政党问题。除了爱尔兰问题和那些涉及工人阶级的问题外，唯一一次论迪斯累里先生《改良法案》的演说几乎是我在三届会期的后两届对于重大决定性辩论所作的全部贡献。</td>
		<td class="en">The same idea, that the use of my being in Parliament was to do work which others were not able or not willing to do, made me think it my duty to come to the front in defence of advanced Liberalism on occasions when the obloquy to be encountered was such as most of the advanced Liberals in the House, preferred not to incur. My first vote in the House was in support of an amendment in favour of Ireland, moved by an Irish member, and for which only five English and Scotch votes were given, including my own: the other four were Mr. Bright, Mr. McLaren, Mr. T. B. Potter, and Mr. Hadfield. And the second speech I delivered was on the Bill to prolong the suspension of the Habeas Corpus in Ireland. In denouncing, on this occasion, the English mode of governing Ireland, I did no more than the general opinion of England now admits to have been just; but the anger against Fenianism was then in all its freshness; any attack on what Fenians19 attacked was looked upon as an apology for them; and I was so unfavourably received by the House, that more than one of my friends advised me (and my own judgment agreed with the advice) to wait, before speaking again, for the favourable opportunity that would be given by the first great debate on the Reform Bill. During this silence, many flattered themselves that I had turned out a failure, and that they should not be troubled with me any more. Perhaps their uncomplimentary comments may, by the force of reaction, have helped to make my speech on the Reform Bill the success it was. My position in the House was further improved by a speech in which I insisted on the duty of paying off the National Debt before our coal supplies are exhausted, and by an ironical reply to some of the Tory leaders who had quoted against me certain passages of my writings and called me to account for others, especially for one in my Considerations on Representative Government which said that the Conservative party was, by the law of its composition, the stupidest party. They gained nothing by drawing attention to this passage, which up to that time had not excited any notice, but the sobriquet of “the stupid party” stuck to them for a considerable time afterwards. Having now no longer any apprehension of not being listened to, I confined myself, as I have since thought, too much, to occasions on which my services seemed specially needed, and abstained more than enough from speaking on the great party questions. With the exception of Irish questions, and those which concerned the working classes, a single speech on Mr. Disraeli’s Reform Bill was nearly all that I contributed to the great decisive debates of the last two of my three sessions. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，回顾我在刚才提到的那两类问题上所起的作用，我十分满意。关于工人阶级，我在论格莱斯顿先生《改良法案》的演说中的主要观点就是支持工人对选举权的要求。之后不久，在罗素勋爵内阁辞职，托利党政府接任后，工人阶级试图在海德公园举行集会，却被警察拒之门外，后来群众拆除了公园围栏。虽然比尔斯先生和工人阶级领导人之前在抗议中离开了，但随后发生了扭打，很多无辜的人受到警察的粗暴对待，令工人阶级的愤怒达到顶点。他们决心再次在海德公园集会，而且他们中的很多人可能会带上武器。政府作好军事准备以抵御他们的行动，十分严重的事情似乎就要发生。在这个危急时刻，我真的相信我能够阻止很多灾祸的发生。在议会中我是支持工人阶级的一方，并且强烈谴责政府的行为。我与其他几位激进派成员受邀参加了改革同盟委员会几个主要成员的会议，劝说他们放弃海德公园计划，并在其他地方举行会议的任务主要落在了我的身上。要说服的不是比尔斯先生和迪克森上校，正相反，这两位绅士显然已经朝相同的方向发挥了他们的影响力，但还远没取得成功。坚持的是那些工人，他们如此坚持原计划，使我被迫寻求最后的方案。我告诉他们，一次必定与军方产生冲突的行动只有在两个前提下才是正当的：第一，如果事态已经发展到迫切需要革命的程度；第二，他们确信自己可以取得成功。经过相当长时间的讨论，他们终于听从了我的观点，因此我可以通知沃波尔先生，工人们放弃了计划。我永远不会忘记当时他松了一大口气，向我表示衷心的感谢。在工人阶级对我作出如此大的让步以后，我认为有义务满足他们的要求，参加他们在农业厅召开的会议并发言。这是我唯一一次参加由改革同盟会召开的会议。我之前一直谢绝成为同盟会的一员，公开的理由是，我不同意其男子选举权和无记名投票的纲领，对于后者我完全不赞同。我也不同意他们高举男子选举权的大旗，即使他们保证没有排斥妇女选举权的意思。因为一旦一个人没能立即执行并公开承认他对一个原则的立场，那么他应该全面遵守这个原则。我之所以特意提到这件事，是因为我那次的行为引起了托利党和托利党自由派媒体的极大不满，后来他们指责我在公众生活的考验中表现得过激和狂热。我不知道他们希望我怎么做，但如果他们知道我所做的事情尽可能地保全了他们，他们就有理由向我表示感谢。我相信在那个特殊的时刻，没有人能够做到这点。我也相信在那个时刻，除了格莱斯顿先生和布赖特先生，没有人有足够的影响力约束工人阶级，但他们都无能为力：格莱斯顿先生的理由很明显，而布赖特先生当时不在城里。</td>
		<td class="en">I have, however, much satisfaction in looking back to the part I took on the two classes of subjects just mentioned. With regard to the working classes, the chief topic of my speech on Mr. Gladstone’s Reform Bill was the assertion of their claims to the suffrage. A little later, after the resignation of Lord Russell20’s Ministry and the succession of a Tory Government, came the attempt of the working classes to hold a meeting in Hyde Park, their exclusion by the police, and the breaking down of the park railing by the crowd. Though Mr. Beales and the leaders of the working men had retired under protest when this took place, a scuffle ensued in which many innocent persons were maltreated by the police, and the exasperation of the working men was extreme. They showed a determination to make another attempt at a meeting in the Park, to which many of them would probably have come armed; the Government made military preparations to resist the attempt, and something very serious seemed impending. At this crisis I really believe that I was the means of preventing much mischief. I had in my place in Parliament taken the side of the working men, and strongly censured the conduct of the Government. I was invited, with several other Radical members, to a conference with the leading members of the Council of the Reform League; and the task fell chiefly upon myself of persuading them to give up the Hyde Park project, and hold their meeting elsewhere. It was not Mr. Beales and Colonel Dickson who needed persuading; on the contrary, it was evident that those gentlemen had already exerted their influence in the same direction, thus far without success. It was the working men who held out, and so bent were they on their original scheme that I was obliged to have recourse to les grands moyens. I told them that a proceeding which would certainly produce a collision with the military, could only be justifiable on two conditions: if the position of affairs had become such that a revolution was desirable, and if they thought themselves able to accomplish one. To this argument, after considerable discussion, they at last yielded: and I was able to inform Mr. Walpole that their intention was given up. I shall never forget the depth of his relief or the warmth of his expressions of gratitude. After the working men had conceded so much to me, I felt bound to comply with their request that I would attend and speak at their meeting at the Agricultural Hall; the only meeting called by the Reform League which I ever attended. I had always declined being a member of the League, on the avowed ground that I did not agree in its programme of manhood suffrage and the ballot: from the ballot I dissented entirely; and I could not consent to hoist the flag of manhood suffrage, even on the assurance that the exclusion of women was not intended to be implied; since if one goes beyond what can be immediately carried and professes to take one’s stand on a principle, one should go the whole length of the principle. I have entered thus particularly into this matter because my conduct on this occasion gave great displeasure to the Tory and Tory-Liberal press, who have charged me ever since with having shown myself, in the trials of public life, intemperate and passionate. I do not know what they expected from me; but they had reason to be thankful to me if they knew from what I had, in all probability, preserved them. And I do not believe it could have been done, at that particular juncture, by any one else. No other person, I believe, had at that moment the necessary influence for restraining the working classes, except Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Bright, neither of whom was available: Mr. Gladstone, for obvious reasons; Mr. Bright, because he was out of town. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在爱尔兰问题上，我同样感到有义务在其中起到决定性的作用。我是议员代表团的重要人物之一，说服德比勋爵放过了已被判刑的芬尼亚党暴动者伯克将军的性命。1868年会议期间，在教会问题上党魁们的处理态度十分积极，我只需要有力附和即可。土地问题从未取得如此大的进展。对地主所有制的盲目崇拜在当时几乎没被动摇，尤其是在议会中。而这个问题的滞后状态，就议会的思想来说，1866年罗素政府提出的极其温和的议案就可以证明，但这项议案还是未能通过。我就这个议案发表了极为谨慎的演说，我试图制定土地问题的一些原则，这样做不是为了激励朋友，而是为了安抚和说服对手。议会改革这个显赫的主题阻碍了这个议案，或者另一个德比勋爵政府提出的类似议案的通过。它们从未通过二读。同时，爱尔兰的不满迹象越来越明显，对两国完全分离的要求已经显现出了威胁性的一面，几乎所有人都觉得要想恢复爱尔兰和不列颠之间的关系，只有采纳比原来设想的更加彻底的国家领土和社会关系的改革。在我看来时机已经到来，现在把我全部想法讲出来应该有用。所以，我在1867年冬天写了小册子《英格兰和爱尔兰》，在1868年议会会期开始前不久出版。这本小册子的主要特色是，一方面表明两国分离对英格兰和爱尔兰都不合时宜，另一方面提出建议，给现有佃农永久的土地使用权来解决土地问题，由国家进行适当的调查后确定固定的地租。</td>
		<td class="en">On Irish affairs also I felt bound to take a decided part. I was one of the foremost in the deputation of members of Parliament who prevailed on Lord Derby to spare the life of the condemned Fenian insurgent, General Burke. The Church question was so vigorously handled by the leaders of the party, in the session of 1868, as to require no more from me than an emphatic adhesion; but the land question was by no means in so advanced a position: the superstitions of landlordism had up to that time been little challenged, especially in Parliament, and the backward state of the question, so far as concerned the Parliamentary mind, was evidenced by the extremely mild measure brought in by Lord Russell’s Government in 1866, which nevertheless could not be carried. On that bill I delivered one of my most careful speeches, in which I attempted to lay down some of the principles of the subject, in a manner calculated less to stimulate friends, than to conciliate and convince opponents. The engrossing subject of Parliamentary Reform prevented either this bill, or one of a similar character brought in by Lord Derby’s Government, from being carried through. They never got beyond the second reading. Meanwhile the signs of Irish disaffection had become much more decided; the demand for complete separation between the two countries had assumed a menacing aspect, and there were few who did not feel that if there was still any chance of reconciling Ireland to British connexion, it could only be by the adoption of much more thorough reforms in the territorial and social relations of the country, than had yet been contemplated. The time seemed to me to have come when it would be useful to speak out my whole mind; and the result was my pamphlet England and Ireland, which was written in the winter of 1867, and published shortly before the commencement of the session of 1868. The leading features of the pamphlet were, on the one hand, an argument to show the undesirableness, for Ireland as well as England, of separation between the countries, and on the other, a proposal for settling the land question by giving to the existing tenants a permanent tenure, at a fixed rent, to be assessed after due enquiry by the State. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了在爱尔兰，这本小册子并不受人欢迎，这在我的意料之中。但是如果除了我所建议的方法外，没有其他方法可以公正地解决爱尔兰问题，或者有安抚爱尔兰人民大众的愿望，那么我提出的建议就是必要的。另一方面，假如有折中的途径可以尝试，我很清楚，提出所谓极端的建议不是阻碍，而是促进产生一个更加温和的实验的正确途径。除非英国公众知道可能会出现一种采取更加强硬方法的情况，或者可能会组成一个更加强硬的政党，否则一个对佃户作出如此大让步的方法，例如格莱斯顿先生的《爱尔兰土地法案》，不大可能是由政府提出的，或者在议会获得通过。正是不列颠人的性格，或者至少是符合不列颠人要求的中上层阶级的性格，诱使他们同意改革的。而且必要的是，他们应当把它看作是一条中间路线。他们认为每个建议都是极端的，猛烈的，除非他们听到其他更极端、更猛烈的建议，他们对极端意见的反感才会自行消除。目前的情况证明了这一点，我的建议遭到谴责，但通过比较，其他任何关于爱尔兰土地改革的方案都被认为是温和的。我发现对我计划的攻击通常在本质上都是错误的观点。人们通常认为我的建议就是，国家应当买下土地进而成为全国土地的地主。但实际上我的建议只是为每个地主提供一种选择，假如在新的条件下他更愿意卖掉而不是保留土地。我充分预见到，大多数地主宁愿继续保留土地所有人的地位，而不愿从政府那里每年领取养老金。他们愿意以比全额地租更优厚的条件保持与佃户的现存关系，政府本可以基于这些全额地租给他们补偿。我早在1868年会议初期论马圭尔先生的决议案时，在一篇爱尔兰问题的演讲中说明了这一点，也作了其他的解释。这篇演说的修改稿，以及我评论福蒂斯丘先生议案的演说稿都已在爱尔兰出版（并非我自己出版，而是经过我允许）。</td>
		<td class="en">The pamphlet was not popular, except in Ireland, as I did not expect it to be. But, if no measure short of that which I proposed would do full justice to Ireland, or afford a prospect of conciliating the mass of the Irish people, the duty of proposing it was imperative; while if, on the other hand, there was any intermediate course which had a claim to a trial, I well knew that to propose something which would be called extreme was the true way not to impede but to facilitate a more moderate experiment. It is most improbable that a measure conceding so much to the tenantry as Mr. Gladstone’s Irish Land Bill, would have been proposed by a Government, or could have been carried through Parliament, unless the British public had been led to perceive that a case might be made, and perhaps a party formed, for a measure considerably stronger. It is the character of the British people, or at least of the higher and middle classes who pass muster for the British people, that to induce them to approve of any change, it is necessary that they should look upon it as a middle course: they think every proposal extreme and violent unless they hear of some other proposal going still farther, upon which their antipathy to extreme views may discharge itself. So it proved in the present instance; my proposal was condemned, but any scheme for Irish Land reform, short of mine, came to be thought moderate by comparison. I may observe that the attacks made on my plan usually gave a very incorrect idea of its nature. It was usually discussed as a proposal that the State should buy up the land and become the universal landlord; though in fact it only offered to each individual landlord this as an alternative, if he liked better to sell his estate than to retain it on the new conditions; and I fully anticipated that most landlords would continue to prefer the position of landowners to that of Government annuitants, and would retain their existing relation to their tenants, often on more indulgent terms than the full rents on which the compensation to be given them by Government would have been based. This and many other explanations I gave in a speech on Ireland, in the debate on Mr. Maguire21’s Resolution, early in the session of 1868. A corrected report of this speech, together with my speech on Mr. Fortescue’s Bill, has been published (not by me, but with my permission) in Ireland. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些年还有另一个十分重要的公共职责，是我必须承担起来的，不管是在议会内还是在议会外。牙买加发生的骚动一开始是由不公正行为引起的，后来由于愤怒和惊恐被夸大成有蓄谋的叛乱，这成为军警暴力和所谓军事法庭判决夺走成百上千条无辜性命的动机或借口。短暂的暴动被镇压后，骚乱又持续了几个星期，伴有很多毁坏财务、鞭打男女的暴行，到处都是大肆烧杀的野蛮场景。这些犯罪者的行径受到英国那些长期支持黑奴制的同类人的辩护和喝彩。起初，不列颠民族似乎将要遭受对当局令人作呕的暴行置之不理，甚至没有任何反抗的耻辱。如果是被其他政府所利用，那么英国人对它的憎恨确实无以言表。然而不久之后，一种愤慨的情绪被激起，人们自发组织起了名为牙买加委员会的协会，他们在形势允许的范围内进行商议，采取行动，来自全国各地的支持者蜂拥而入。我当时在国外，但是我一听到消息就报名申请加入，回国以后积极参加到他们的行动当中。这里有比公正地对待黑人更危急、更有必要考虑的问题。问题是不列颠的属地，也许最终还有大不列颠本身是在受法律的管理还是军事特权的管理。不列颠子民的生命和人格是否受到两三个既没经验又粗鲁的军官支配？一个惊慌失措的总督或者其他官吏是否可以行使权利，构建一个所谓的军事法庭？这个问题只有上诉到法庭才能解决，所以委员会决定上诉。他们的决心引起委员会主席的更换，因为原主席查尔斯·巴克斯顿先生认为向刑事法庭起诉艾尔总督及其主要属下并非不公正，而是失策的行为。然而，有许多人参加的委员会大会决定反对他的观点，最终巴克斯顿先生退出了委员会，但继续为这项事业工作。出乎我意料的是，我被提名当选为委员会主席。结果在下院代表这个委员会就成了我的责任。有时向政府提问，有时接受个别议员向我提出的或多或少有些挑衅的问题。特别是，作为1866年会期由巴克斯顿发起的一场重要辩论的发言者，我那时的演说也许是我在议会里最好的演说。在这两年多的时间里，我们一直在进行斗争，尝试每一条合法通向刑事法庭的道路。英格兰一个拥有最多托利党人的郡的法庭不受理我们的诉讼，但在鲍街法庭我们却取得了成功，这使王座法院的大法官亚历山大·科伯恩爵士有机会作出最著名的判决，就法官解决问题的权力来讲，他的判决解决了有利于自由的法律问题。但我们的成功就此结束了，因为中央刑事法院大陪审团撤销了我们的诉讼，使其最终未被受理。显然，向刑事法庭起诉英国官员对黑人和混血儿滥用职权的罪名并不受英国中层阶级的欢迎。但就我们而言，我们挽回了我们国家的声誉，表明我们在任何时候都有一群人决心利用法律提供的所有手段为受害人伸张正义。我们从国家最高刑事法庭得到权威性的宣言，宣布法律就是我们所坚持的东西。我们已经郑重警告那些以后可能被诱惑去犯类似罪行的人，虽然他们可能一时逃过刑事法庭的实际制裁，但是为了逃脱免不了会陷入麻烦并付出代价。殖民地总督和其他当权人士将来就有十足的理由避免这种困境。</td>
		<td class="en">Another public duty, of a most serious kind, it was my lot to have to perform, both in and out of Parliament, during these years. A disturbance in Jamaica, provoked in the first instance by injustice, and exaggerated by rage and panic into a premeditated rebellion, had been the motive or excuse for taking hundreds of innocent lives by military violence, or by sentence of what were called courts martial, continuing for weeks after the brief disturbance had been put down; with many added atrocities of destruction of property, flogging women as well as men, and a great display of the brutal recklessness which generally prevails when fire and sword are let loose. The perpetrators of those deeds were defended and applauded in England by the same kind of people who had so long upheld negro slavery: and it seemed at first as if the British nation was about to incur the disgrace of letting pass without even a protest, excesses of authority as revolting as any of those for which, when perpetrated by the instruments of other governments, Englishmen can hardly find terms sufficient to express their abhorrence. After a short time, however, an indignant feeling was roused; a voluntary Association formed itself under the name of the Jamaica Committee, to take such deliberation and action as the case might admit of, and adhesions poured in from all parts of the country. I was abroad at the time, but I sent in my name to the Committee as soon as I heard of it, and took an active part in the proceedings from the time of my return. There was much more at stake than only justice to the Negroes, imperative as was that consideration. The question was, whether the British dependencies, and eventually, perhaps, Great Britain itself, were to be under the government of law, or of military license; whether the lives and persons of British subjects are at the mercy of any two or three officers however raw and inexperienced or reckless and brutal, whom a panicstricken Governor or other functionary may assume the right to constitute into a so-called Court Martial. This question could only be decided by an appeal to the tribunals; and such an appeal the Committee determined to make. Their determination led to a change in the Chairmanship of the Committee, as the Chairman, Mr. Charles Buxton22, thought it not unjust indeed, but inexpedient, to prosecute Governor Eyre23 and his principal subordinates in a criminal court: but a numerously attended General meeting of the Association having decided this point against him, Mr. Buxton withdrew from the Committee, though continuing to work in the cause, and I was, quite unexpectedly on my own part, proposed and elected Chairman. It became, in consequence, my duty to represent the Committee in the House of Commons, sometimes by putting questions to the Government, sometimes as the recipient of questions more or less provocative, addressed by individual members to myself; but especially as speaker in the important debate originated in the session of 1866, by Mr. Buxton: and the speech I then delivered is that which I should probably select as the best of my speeches in Parliament. For more than two years we carried on the combat, trying every avenue legally open to us, to the Courts of Criminal Justice. A bench of magistrates in one of the most Tory counties in England dismissed our case: we were more successful before the magistrates at Bow Street; which gave an opportunity to the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen’s Bench, Sir Alexander Cockburn24, for delivering his celebrated charge, which settled the law of the question in favour of liberty, as far as it is in the power of a judge’s charge to settle it. There, however, our success ended, for the Old Bailey Grand Jury by throwing out our bill prevented the case from coming to trial. It was clear that to bring English functionaries to the bar of a criminal court for abuses of power committed against negroes and mulattoes, was not a popular proceeding with the English middle classes. We had, however, redeemed, so far as lay in us, the character of our country, by showing that there was at any rate a body of persons determined to use all the means which the law afforded to obtain justice for the injured. We had elicited from the highest criminal judge in the nation an authoritative declaration that the law was what we maintained it to be; and we had given an emphatic warning to those who might be tempted to similar guilt hereafter, that, though they might escape the actual sentence of a criminal tribunal, they were not safe against being put to some trouble and expense in order to avoid it. Colonial Governors and other persons in authority will have a considerable motive to stop short of such extremities in future. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我积极参加却很少引起公众兴趣的其他重要事情中，有两件事特别值得一提。我和其他几个独立的自由党人一起击败了1866年会期结束前提出的《引渡法案》。法案中规定，虽然引渡政治犯未得到公开授权，但如果政治避难者被外国政府指控有必然引发暴动的行为，就要被引渡去他们反叛政府的刑事法庭听受处分。这使大不列颠政府成为外国专制政府报复的帮凶。这个议案的失败使得特别委员会（包括我在内）成立，以审查和报告引渡条约的全部内容。结果是在我离开议会以后，议会通过了《引渡法》，使任何被要求引渡的人都有机会在英国法庭前证明他所受的指控是真正政治性的。欧洲的自由事业由此而免受一场不幸，我们的国家也幸免于一次严重的邪恶行为。另外需要提到的是，在1868年的会期中，一批自由党进步人士坚持就迪斯累里政府提出的《贿赂法案》进行斗争，我也积极参与其中。我与几位对这个问题的细节做过十分认真研究的人——克里斯蒂先生、普林律师和查德威克先生——商议并提出了很多我自己的想法，目的是制定修正案和增加条款，使《法案》真正有效地防范许多直接和间接的贿赂行为，否则我们有充分的理由担心，贿赂行为可能因《改良法》增加而非减少。我们还致力于在法案中加入其他措施，以减少所谓的竞选合法开支这种有害负担。在许多修正案当中，有一个是由福西特先生提出的，规定选举检察人的费用应当由税收而非候选人承担。另外禁止有偿拉选票，以及限制每位候选人只有一位带薪代理人。第三条是将防范和惩罚贿赂行为扩展到市级选举。众所周知，市级选举不但是议会选举贿赂的预备学校，也一贯是包庇贿赂的地方。然而，保守政府一旦通过了法案中的主要条款（我曾投票支持并发言），把选举管辖权从下院移至法院，他们就会坚决反对所有其他的改进。福西特先生提出了一个最重要的提议，实际上已获得了大多数人的赞成，之后他们号召党内力量在下一阶段否决这个提议。下院的自由党人因其许多成员的行为深感耻辱，因为他们对确保人们诚实选举必要条件的尝试未曾给过任何帮助。凭他们在下院占有的绝大多数席位，他们本可以通过所有的修正案，假如有更好的议案也会通过。但会期已晚，议员们已在迫切地准备即将到来的大选。虽然几位议员（比如罗伯特·安斯特拉瑟爵士）仍令人尊敬地坚守着岗位，而竞争对手已经开始游说他们选区的选民，但他们中的大多数人把个人选举的利益放在公共责任之上。很多自由党人也对反贿赂立法漠然处之，认为它仅仅是将公众注意从无记名投票转移过来，他们把无记名投票视为一种充分且唯一的补救方法，我想将来肯定会证明这是十分错误的。由于这些原因，我们虽然斗志昂扬地坚持战斗了几个晚上，但战斗还是彻底失败了。我们曾试图增加贿赂的难度，而在新选举法实施后举行的第一届大选中，贿赂却比以前更加猖獗。</td>
		<td class="en">Among other matters of importance in which I took an active part, but which excited little interest in the public, two deserve particular mention. I joined with several other independent Liberals in defeating an Extradition Bill, introduced at the very end of the session of 1866, and by which, though surrender avowedly for political offences was not authorised, political refugees, if charged by a foreign government with acts which are necessarily incident to all attempts at insurrection, would have been surrendered to be dealt with by the criminal courts of the government against which they had rebelled: thus making the British Government an accomplice in the vengeance of foreign despotisms. The defeat of this proposal led to the appointment of a Select Committee (in which I was included) to examine and report on the whole subject of Extradition Treaties; and the result was that in the Extradition Act, which passed through Parliament after I had ceased to be a member, opportunity is given to any one whose extradition is demanded, of being heard before an English Court of justice to prove that the offence with which he is charged, is really political. The cause of European freedom has thus been saved from a serious misfortune, and our own country from a great iniquity. The other subject to be mentioned is the fight kept up by a body of advanced Liberals in the session of 1868, on the Bribery Bill of Mr. Disraeli’s Government, in which I took a very active part. I had taken counsel with several of those who had applied their minds most carefully to the details of the subject—Mr. W. D. Christie, Serjeant Pulling, Mr. Chadwick25—as well as bestowed much thought of my own, for the purpose of framing such amendments and additional clauses as might make the Bill really effective against the numerous modes of corruption, direct and indirect, which might otherwise, as there was much reason to fear, be increased instead of diminished by the Reform Act. We also aimed at engrafting on the Bill, measures for diminishing the mischievous burthen of what are called the legitimate expenses of elections. Among our many amendments, was that of Mr. Fawcett26 for making the returning officer’s expenses a charge on the rates, instead of on the candidates; another was the prohibition of paid canvassers, and the limitation of paid agents to one for each candidate; a third was the extension of the precautions and penalties against bribery, to municipal elections, which are well known to be not only a preparatory school for bribery at parliamentary elections, but an habitual cover for it. The Conservative Government, however, when once they had carried the leading provision of their Bill (for which I voted and spoke), the transfer of the jurisdiction in elections from the House of Commons to the Judges, made a determined resistance to all other improvements; and after one of our most important proposals, that of Mr. Fawcett, had actually obtained a majority, they summoned the strength of their party and threw out the clause in a subsequent stage. The Liberal party in the House was greatly dishonoured by the conduct of many of its members in giving no help whatever to this attempt to secure the necessary conditions of an honest representation of the people. With their large majority in the House they could have carried all the amendments, or better ones if they had better to propose. But it was late in the Session; members were eager to set about their preparations for the impending General Election: and while some (such as Sir Robert Anstruther27) honourably remained at their post, though rival candidates were already canvassing their constituency, a much greater number placed their electioneering interests before their public duty. Many Liberals also looked with indifference on legislation against bribery, thinking that it merely diverted public interest from the Ballot, which they considered, very mistakenly as I expect it will turn out, to be a sufficient, and the only, remedy. From these causes our fight, though kept up with great vigour for several nights, was wholly unsuccessful, and the practices which we sought to render more difficult, prevailed more widely than ever in the first General Election held under the new electoral law. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在对迪斯累里《改良法案》的一般辩论中，我的参与仅仅限于上文提到的那篇演说，但我借机把代议制政府尚需做的两项重大改进措施正式摆到了下院和全国人民面前。一个是个人代表制，或者同样可以恰当地称为比例代表制。我通过就黑尔先生的方案发表阐述性和议论性的演说提出这项措施让下院考虑。之后我积极支持一项代替黑尔方案但很不完善的方案，这个方案在少数选区被议会采纳。这个可怜的权宜之计除了部分承认它不能根治的弊病外，几乎没有可取之处。但即便如此，它还是受到同样谬误的攻击，需要用同样的原则保护，就像真正良好的措施那样。它在一些议会选举中被采纳，同样伦敦教育委员会选举中也引进了所谓的累计投票制。它把所有选举人的平等权利转变为代表制中的按比例分配名额，把纯粹的理论探讨转变成实际的政治问题，效果很好。如果没有实施这个方案，就不会产生如此立竿见影的效果。</td>
		<td class="en">In the general debates on Mr. Disraeli’s Reform Bill, my participation was limited to the one speech already mentioned; but I made the Bill an occasion for bringing the two greatest improvements which remain to be made in representative government formally before the House and the nation. One of them was Personal, or as it is called with equal propriety, Proportional Representation. I brought this under the consideration of the House, by an expository and argumentative speech on Mr. Hare’s plan; and subsequently I was active in support of the very imperfect substitute for that plan, which, in a small number of constituencies, Parliament was induced to adopt. This poor makeshift had scarcely any recommendation, except that it was a partial recognition of the evil which it did so little to remedy. As such however it was attacked by the same fallacies, and required to be defended on the same principles, as a really good measure; and its adoption in a few parliamentary elections, as well as the subsequent introduction of what is called the Cumulative Vote in the elections for the London School Board, have had the good effect of converting the equal claim of all electors to a proportional share in the representation, from a subject of merely speculative discussion, into a question of practical politics, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我支持个人代表制，并不是因为它会产生相当多的或明显的实际效果。相反，我提出的另一个动议就不同，它是《改良法案》的一个修正案，是我做议员期间履行的最重要的，也许是唯一重要的公职。这项动议去掉了被理解成选举权仅限于男性的措辞，从而允许所有拥有男性选民资格的妇女，无论是否为户主，都有选举权。当选举权大规模增加时，不要求选举权的妇女就相当于完全公开放弃这个权利。这个运动开始于1866年，我呈递了一份由许多杰出妇女签名的争取选举权的请愿书。但不确定的是这个提议能否获得下院议员们零星的几张赞成票。当辩论过后，反对方的发言显然软弱无力，所以赞成动议的票数达到73票。加上不投票的议员和计票员，总数达80多票。这在我们意料之外，也因此令人大受鼓舞。更鼓舞我们的是这些投赞成票的人当中有布赖特先生，这只能归因于这场辩论对他产生的影响，因为他以前毫不掩饰地表示不同意这个提议。这次看来是我的女儿，海伦·泰勒小姐组织了一个社团来扩大妇女选举权。这个社团是由我女儿创办的，章程也完全是由她设计的，虽然因为身体孱弱加上工作缠身，她谢绝成为执行委员会的一员，但运动的第一年她仍是活动的灵魂。很多尊贵的议员、教授及其他人，还有一些国家引以为傲的出色女性也成为社团成员，这其中很大的一部分是受我女儿直接或间接的影响。她写了大量的信件，并以此赢得了支持，甚至有些信件上署了我的名字。有两件事让我记忆犹新，分别与南丁格尔小姐和玛丽·卡彭特小姐有关，她们起初都不愿意加入（因为这和她们的意见相左）。后来我女儿以我的名义写了几封请求信，才得到她们的同意。其他的一些地区中心也以相同的目的成立了协会，包括曼彻斯特、爱丁堡、伯明翰、布里斯托尔、格拉斯哥以及其他一些为这项事业作出卓著贡献的城市。所有的社团都取名为“国家妇女选举权协会”分会，但每个分会都有自己的管理机构，以完全独立的方式运作。</td>
		<td class="en">This assertion of my opinions on Personal Representation cannot be credited with any considerable or visible amount of practical result. It was otherwise with the other motion which I made in the form of an amendment to the Reform Bill, and which was by far the most important, perhaps the only really important public service I performed in the capacity of a Member of Parliament: a motion to strike out the words which were understood to limit the electoral franchise to males, and thereby to admit to the suffrage all women who, as householders or otherwise, possess the qualification required of male electors. For women not to make their claim to the suffrage, at the time when the elective franchise was being largely extended, would have been to abjure the claim altogether; and a movement on the subject was begun in 1866, when I presented a petition for the suffrage, signed by a considerable number of distinguished women. But it was as yet uncertain whether the proposal would obtain more than a few stray votes in the House: and when, after a debate in which the speakers on the contrary side were conspicuous by their feebleness, the votes recorded in favour of the motion amounted to 73—made up by pairs and tellers to above 80—the surprise was general, and the encouragement great: the greater, too, because one of those who voted for the motion was Mr. Bright, a fact which could only be attributed to the impression made on him by the debate, as he had previously made no secret of his non-concurrence in the proposal. The time appeared to my daughter, Miss Helen Taylor, to have come for forming a Society for the extension of the suffrage to women. The existence of the Society is due to my daughter’s initiative; its constitution was planned entirely by her, and she was the soul of the movement during its first years, though delicate health and superabundant occupation made her decline to be a member of the Executive Committee. Many distinguished members of parliament, professors, and others, and some of the most eminent women of whom the country can boast, became members of the Society, a large proportion either directly or indirectly through my daughter’s influence, she having written the greater number, and all the best, of the letters by which adhesion was obtained, even when those letters bore my signature. In two remarkable instances, those of Miss Nightingale28 and Miss Mary Carpenter29, the reluctance those ladies had at first felt to come forward (for it was not on their part difference of opinion) was overcome by appeals written by my daughter though signed by me. Associations for the same object were formed in various local centres, Manchester, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, and others which have done much valuable work for the cause. All the Societies take the title of branches of the National Society for Women’s Suffrage; but each has its own governing body, and acts in complete independence of the others. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我相信我已经提到了我在下院期间所有值得回忆的事情。但这些描述即便是完整的，仍然不能让人们充分了解我那段时期的工作，尤其是通信花去的那段时间。在我入选议会前的那几年，我经常收到陌生人的来信，大多都称我为哲学方面的作家，他们就逻辑学或者政治经济学方面，要么和我探讨些难懂的问题，要么与我交流想法。总的来说，我猜想我和所有著名的政治学家一样，收到了很多包含肤浅理论和荒谬提议的来信，通过这些来信，人们以巧妙的重组货币的方式，不断努力展示通往全民富裕和幸福的道路。当写信人表现出足够的智慧，还有纠正的可能时，我就会不辞辛劳地指出他们的错误，直到后来我的通信数量的增长使我不得不用简短的话回复这些人。但是我收到的许多来信中很多比这些更值得关注，其中有些指出我作品中忽略的细节，使我能够改正。这种通信自然随着我写作主题的增加而增加，尤其是那些关于形而上学的主题。但自从我成为议员之后，我开始收到私人的投诉信，以及有关公众事务能想到的问题的信件，尽管很多与我的知识和追求相去甚远。带给我这些负担的并不是我在威斯敏斯特的选民，他们对我同意效忠的事业保持着相当的忠诚。事实上，我不时收到一个天真的年轻人写来的申请信，要我帮他在政府中谋得一官半职。无论是哪个政党执政，我都会收到这样的来信，虽然这种信件很少，但可以表明写信人是多么的单纯无知。我不变的回答是，请求政府的帮助与我当选的原则背道而驰。但总的来说，我自己的选民带给我的麻烦少于全国其他地区。然而，越来越多的来信成为我沉重的负担。那时以及从那以后，我的大部分回信（包括登报回复）都由我的女儿代笔。她的初衷只是帮助我处理大量的超过我个人回复能力的信件，但后来我发现她回信的水平比我的高，尤其是她能作出与当时的难度和重要性相应的回复。即使我自己写的信也基本交给她修改，就像我最近准备的演讲稿一样，我的一些出版作品，不仅仅是其中几段，就连最成功的那部分都是她的杰作。</td>
		<td class="en">I believe I have mentioned all that is worth remembering of my proceedings in the House. But their enumeration, even if complete, would give but an inadequate idea of my occupations during that period, and especially of the time taken up by correspondence. For many years before my election to Parliament, I had been continually receiving letters from strangers, mostly addressed to me as a writer on philosophy, and either propounding difficulties or communicating thoughts on subjects connected with logic or political economy. In common, I suppose, with all who are known as political economists, I was a recipient of all the shallow theories and absurd proposals by which people are perpetually endeavouring to show the way to universal wealth and happiness by some artful reorganisation of the currency. When there were signs of sufficient intelligence in the writers to make it worth while attempting to put them right, I took the trouble to point out their errors, until the growth of my correspondence made it necessary to dismiss such persons with very brief answers. Many, however, of the communications I received were more worthy of attention than these, and in some, over-sights of detail were pointed out in my writings, which I was thus enabled to correct. Correspondence of this sort naturally multiplied with the multiplication of the subjects on which I wrote, especially those of a metaphysical character. But when I became a member of Parliament, I began to receive letters on private grievances and on every imaginable subject that related to any kind of public affairs, however remote from my knowledge or pursuits. It was not my constituents in Westminster who laid this burthen on me: they kept with remarkable fidelity the understanding on which I had consented to serve. I received, indeed, now and then an application from some ingenuous youth to procure for him a small Government appointment; but these were few, and how simple and ignorant the writers were, was shown by the fact that the applications came in about equally whichever party was in power. My invariable answer was, that it was contrary to the principles on which I was elected to ask favours of any Government. But, on the whole, hardly any part of the country gave me less trouble than my own constituents. The general mass of correspondence, however, swelled into an oppressive burthen. At this time, and thenceforth, a great proportion of all my letters (including many which found their way into the newspapers) were not written by me but by my daughter; at first merely from her willingness to help in disposing of a mass of letters greater than I could get through without assistance, but afterwards because I thought the letters she wrote superior to mine, and more so in proportion to the difficulty and importance of the occasion. Even those which I wrote myself were generally much improved by her, as is also the case with all the more recent of my prepared speeches, of which, and of some of my published writings, not a few passages, and those the most successful, were hers. </td></tr>

In this Discourse I gave expression to many thoughts and opinions which had been accumulating in me through life, respecting the various studies which belong to a liberal education, their uses and influences, and the mode in which they should be pursued to render those influences most beneficial. The position taken up, vindicating the high educational value alike of the old classic and the new scientific studies, on even stronger grounds than are urged by most of their advocates, and insisting that it is only the stupid inefficiency of the usual teaching which makes those studies be regarded as competitors instead of allies, was, I think, calculated, not only to aid and stimulate the improvement which has happily commenced in the national institutions for higher education, but to diffuse juster ideas than we often find, even in highly educated men, on the conditions of the highest mental cultivation. </td></tr>

This was a joint undertaking: the psychological notes being furnished in about equal proportions by Mr. Bain and myself, while Mr. Grote supplied some valuable contributions on points in the history of philosophy incidentally raised, and Dr. Andrew Findlater30 supplied the deficiencies in the book which had been occasioned by the imperfect philological knowledge of the time when it was written. Having been originally published at a time when the current of metaphysical speculation ran in a quite opposite direction to the psychology of Experience and Association, the “Analysis” had not obtained the amount of immediate success which it deserved, though it had made a deep impression on many individual minds, and had largely contributed, through those minds, to create that more favourable atmosphere for the Association Psychology of which we now have the benefit. Admirably adapted for a class-book of the Experience Metaphysics, it only required to be enriched, and in some cases corrected, by the results of more recent labours in the same school of thought, to stand, as it now does, in company with Mr. Bain’s treatises, at the head of the systematic works on Analytic Psychology. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1868年秋天，通过《改良法》的议会解散了，在新一届威斯敏斯特选举中我竞选失利，这并没让我吃惊，我相信我的主要支持者们也不会吃惊，虽然在接下来几天的选举中他们抱着更大的希望。如果我从未当选也就无需解释，让人好奇的是我第一次当选了，或者已经当选，但后来又落选了。但是第二次他们为了打败我所作的努力远远比第一次多。一方面，托利党政府正在为继续当选努力，在任何竞选中的胜利对他们来说都很重要。另外，所有同情托利党的人对我个人的怨恨也比上一届多很多。许多原来对我当选不置可否的人，现在都激烈地反对我再次当选。因为我在很多政治作品中表明自己已经意识到了民主见解的弱点，一些保守派人士似乎希望把我当作民主制度的敌人，因为我可以从保守党的角度去看待问题，他们就断定我像他们一样看不到其他的方面。但如果他们真的读过我的作品，他们就会知道在强调了所有我认为有充分证据支持的反对民主的观点后，我毫不犹豫地作出了有利于民主的论断，并且建议民主应当通过符合其原则并能去除其不便的制度来实现。其中一个主要的解决方法就是比例代表制，但保守党几乎没有人支持这个建议。一些托利党人的期待似乎是建立在我对多选区投票权认可的前提上的。人们推测，这个建议是迪斯累里在准备他的《改良法案》时向下院提出的决议案中的一个（没有人支持他的建议，他也没有施加压力），这可能是由我就这个问题所写的文章引起的。但假如是这样，人们忘记了我的建议还有一个明确的条件，那就是一人多选区的特权附加的是关于教育程度而不是财产状况的条件，即便如此，我只是在假定普选权的情况下才同意的。在目前《改良法》规定的选举制度下，这种多选区投票权是不能接受的。怀疑这一点的人，只要看看工人阶级在选举中所占的如此小的分量就会明白，即使法律规定一人只能投一票。</td>
		<td class="en">In the autumn of 1868 the Parliament which passed the Reform Act was dissolved, and at the new election for Westminster I was thrown out; not to my surprise, nor, I believe, to that of my principal supporters, though in the few days preceding the election they had become more sanguine than before. That I should not have been elected at all would not have required any explanation; what excites curiosity is that I should have been elected the first time, or, having been elected then, should have been defeated afterwards. But the efforts made to defeat me were far greater on the second occasion than on the first. For one thing, the Tory Government was now struggling for existence, and success in any contest was of more importance to them. Then, too, all persons of Tory feelings were far more embittered against me individually than on the previous occasion; many who had at first been either favourable or indifferent, were vehemently opposed to my re-election. As I had shown in my political writings that I was aware of the weak points in democratic opinions, some Conservatives, it seems, had not been without hopes of finding me an opponent of democracy: as I was able to see the Conservative side of the question, they presumed that, like them, I could not see any other side. Yet if they had really read my writings they would have known that after giving full weight to all that appeared to me well grounded in the arguments against democracy, I unhesitatingly decided in its favour, while recommending that it should be accompanied by such institutions as were consistent with its principle and calculated to ward off its inconveniences: one of the chief of these remedies being Proportional Representation, on which scarcely any of the Conservatives gave me any support. Some Tory expectations appear to have been founded on the approbation I had expressed of plural voting, under certain conditions: and it has been surmised that the suggestion of this sort made in one of the resolutions which Mr. Disraeli introduced into the House preparatory to his Reform Bill (a suggestion which meeting with no favour he did not press), may have been occasioned by what I had written on the point: but if so, it was forgotten that I had made it an express condition that the privilege of a plurality of votes should be annexed to education, not to property, and even so, had approved of it only on the supposition of universal suffrage. How utterly inadmissible such plural voting would be under the suffrage given by the present Reform Act, is proved, to any who could otherwise doubt it, by the very small weight which the working classes are found to possess in elections, even under the law which gives no more votes to any one elector than to any other. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >与原来相比，我现在更加危及托利党人的利益，也更令保守的自由派人士不愉快，我在议会中所追求的事业绝对不会让多数自由派人士热情地支持我。这之前我已经提到，我出色的登台演讲大多是论述与多数自由派见解不同的观点或他们极少关心的问题，我采取的方针路线很少能引起他们的重视，并使他们把我当作自己意见的喉舌。另外我做的事情引起了很多人对我的个人偏见。很多人因为他们所谓的迫害艾尔先生的事件而大怒，令他们更加愤怒的是我捐了一些钱作为布雷德洛先生的竞选费用。我自己竞选时没有花费任何费用，几乎都由他人支付，我感到有特殊的义务用捐款来回报那些缺少资金但有望当选的候选人。所以我几乎给所有工人阶级候选人捐款，尤其是对布雷德洛先生。他受到工人阶级的支持，我听过他的演讲，认定他是有能力之人，在马尔萨斯主义和个人代表制这两个重要问题上，他强烈反对当时流行的民主党意见，证明了自己不是蛊惑民心之人。这样一个既有劳动阶级民主情感，自己判断政治问题，又有勇气逆流而上主张个人信念的人，在我看来是议会需要的人物。我认为不应当因为布雷德洛反对宗教的见解而把他排除在议会之外（虽然他曾经言辞激烈地表达过这样的见解）。如果我只考虑自己再次当选的利益，那为他的竞选捐款是十分鲁莽的。不出所料，很多人对我的这个举动大加利用，无论公正与否，来煽动威斯敏斯特选区的投票者反对我。基于这种种原因，加上我的托利党竞争者大肆利用惯用的金钱手段和其他影响力，而我却没有这么做，我在第一次竞选胜利后，第二次却失败了。竞选结果公布后不久，我就收到了三四封信，邀请我做其他选区的候选人（主要是郡级）。但即便有成功的希望，即便可以不用承担费用，我也不想摒弃让自己享受回归个人生活的轻松。我已没有理由因为选民对我的反对而感到耻辱。假如我真的有，这种感觉也远远不如我从各界人士和各地收到的无数慰问信重要，尤其是不如收到那些我惯于合作的自由党议员们的慰问信重要。</td>
		<td class="en">While I thus was far more obnoxious to the Tory interest, and to many Conservative Liberals than I had formerly been, the course I pursued in Parliament had by no means been such as to make Liberals generally at all enthusiastic in my support. It has already been mentioned, how large a proportion of my prominent appearances had been on questions on which I differed from most of the Liberal party or about which they cared little, and how few occasions there had been on which the line I took was such as could lead them to attach any great value to me as an organ of their opinions. I had moreover done things which had excited, in many minds, a personal prejudice against me. Many were offended by what they called the persecution of Mr. Eyre: and still greater offence was taken at my sending a subscription to the election expenses of Mr. Bradlaugh31. Having refused to be at any expense for my own election, and having had all its expenses defrayed by others, I felt under a peculiar obligation to subscribe in my turn where funds were deficient for candidates whose election was desirable. I accordingly sent subscriptions to nearly all the working class candidates, and among others to Mr. Bradlaugh. He had the support of the working classes; having heard him speak, I knew him to be a man of ability, and he had proved that he was the reverse of a demagogue, by placing himself in strong opposition to the prevailing opinion of the democratic party on two such important subjects as Malthusianism and Personal Representation. Men of this sort, who, while sharing the democratic feelings of the working classes, judged political questions for themselves, and had courage to assert their individual convictions against popular opposition, were needed, as it seemed to me, in Parliament, and I did not think that Mr. Bradlaugh’s anti-religious opinions (even though he had been intemperate in the expression of them) ought to exclude him. In subscribing, however, to his election, I did what would have been highly imprudent if I had been at liberty to consider only the interests of my own reelection; and, as might be expected, the utmost possible use, both fair and unfair, was made of this act of mine to stir up the electors of Westminster against me. To these various causes, combined with an unscrupulous use of the usual pecuniary and other influences on the side of my Tory competitor, while none were used on my side, it is to be ascribed that I failed at my second election after having succeeded at the first. No sooner was the result of the election known than I received three or four invitations to become a candidate for other constituencies, chiefly counties; but even if success could have been expected, and this without expense, I was not disposed to deny myself the relief of returning to private life. I had no cause to feel humiliated at my rejection by the electors; and if I had, the feeling would have been far outweighed by the numerous expressions of regret which I received from all sorts of persons and places, and in a most marked degree from those members of the Liberal party in Parliament with whom I had been accustomed to act. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从那以后，几乎没有发生什么事情值得我在此记录。我重拾旧趣，回到欧洲南部享受田园生活，每年轮流两次在伦敦附近住上几周或几个月。我为期刊写了许多文章（主要发表在我朋友莫利先生的《双周评论》上），在公共场合，特别是在妇女投票权协会的会议上发表过为数不多的几次演说，我女儿和我把几年前写的《论妇女的从属地位》增加了一些内容后出版，并开始为以后出书准备资料。如果我在有生之年能写完这些新作品的话，那还有机会再作说明。因此，这本自传到这里可以结束了。</td>

I returned to my old pursuits and to the enjoyment of a country life in the South of Europe, alternating twice a year with a residence of some weeks or months in the neighbourhood of London. I have written various articles in periodicals (chiefly in my friend Mr. Morley’s Fortnightly Review), have made a small number of speeches on public occasions, especially at the meetings of the Women’s Suffrage Society, have published The Subjection of Women, written some years before, with some additions by my daughter and myself, and have commenced the preparation of matter for future books, of which it will be time to speak more particularly if I live to finish them.
