		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老德马内维尔先生是诺曼地区的一位受人尊重的贵族，与马雷夏尔·德黎塞留有很深的交情。老黎塞留公爵在吉耶纳做总督的时候，为德马内维尔做媒，让他娶了波尔多地区一位最富有的女继承人为妻。老德马内维尔的妻子在朗斯特拉克有一座庄园，庄园景色宜人，老德马内维尔被深深地吸引了，于是这个诺曼人将自己在贝桑地区的房产卖了，做起加斯科涅的居民来。在路易十五统治末期，他花钱买了个宫廷卫队副官的职位，后来又非常幸运地在法国大革命中以下面的方法逃过了一劫，一直活到了1813年。</td>
		<td class="en">Monsieur de Manerville, the father, was a worthy Norman gentleman, well known to the Marechael de Richelieu, who married him to one of the richest heiresses of Bordeaux in the days when the old duke reigned in Guienne as governor.The Norman then sold the estate he owned in Bessin, and became a Gascon, allured by the beauty of the chateau de Lanstrac, a delightful residence owned by his wife.During the last days of the reign of Louis XV., he bought the post of major of the Gate Guards, and lived till 1813, having by great good luck escaped the dangers of the Revolution in the following manner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在1790年底，他去了马提尼克——他妻子在那里有些产业，并将加斯科涅的产业交由一位诚实的公证人去打理。这位名叫马蒂亚斯的公证人对新思想或多或少有些着迷。德马内维尔伯爵回来后，发现他的产业不仅完好无损，甚至还运营良好。这样的佳绩是加斯科涅人和诺曼人合作的结果。</td>
		<td class="en">Toward the close of the year, 1790, he went to Martinque, where his wife had interests, leaving the management of his property in Gascogne to an honest man, a notary’s clerk, named Mathias, who was inclined to—or at any rate did—give into the new ideas.On his return the Comte de Manerville found his possessions intact and well-managed.This sound result was the fruit produced by grafting the Gascon on the Norman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >德马内维尔夫人于1810年逝世。经历过年轻时大肆挥霍的生活，老德马内维尔先生明白钱财的重要性。像其他很多老头一样，他高估了钱财在实际生活中的作用，渐渐地变得十分节俭和吝啬，甚至视财如命。他似乎从没考虑过父母吝财儿挥霍的道理，他对自己的儿子也几乎一毛不拔，何况这还是他的独生儿子。</td>
		<td class="en">Madame de Manerville died in 1810.Having learned the importance of worldly goods through the dissipations of his youth, and, giving them, like many another old man, a higher place than they really hold in life, Monsieur de Manerville became increasingly economical, miserly, and sordid.Without reflecting that the avarice of parents prepares the way for the prodigalities of children, he allowed almost nothing to his son, although that son was an only child.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >保尔·德马内维尔1810年从旺多姆大学回到父亲身边，在父亲的严格管教下度过了三年时光。一个七十多岁的老人对自己的接班人实行的暴政，肯定会对他尚未成形的心灵和性格产生影响。在加斯科涅的空气中充斥的勇敢精神，保尔身上并不缺乏。但他不敢与父亲抗争，最终失去了能激发道义勇气的反抗力。他受到压抑的情感被驱逐到内心深处，久久得不到抒发。后来，当他感觉到自己的情感与人世间的准则不符合的时候，他成了一个仅仅在思想上正确、在行为上却会犯错误的人。为了一句话或一个眼神，他就可以和人动武。但是一想到要辞退一个家仆，他就会浑身颤抖——在那些需要顽强意志的斗争中，他的懦弱就会显露出来了。他本来具备做大事以逃脱迫害的能力，但是他既不曾有步骤、有计划地反抗过，也不曾坚持不懈地运用自己的意志力去面对。他是思想上的懦夫，却是行动上的莽夫。长久以来，他保持着内心的单纯，情愿在很多事情上吃亏上当。对于这些事情，那些优柔寡断、不敢反抗的人往往宁愿默默忍受，也不愿诉苦抱怨。事实上，他是父亲那古老宅院中的一个囚徒，因为他没有足够的钱和别的年轻人交往；他羡慕那些人的快乐，却无法分享。</td>
		<td class="en">Paul de Manerville, coming home from the college of Vendome in 1810, lived under close paternal discipline for three years.The tyranny by which the old man of seventy oppressed his heir influenced, necessarily, a heart and a character which were not yet formed.Paul, the son, without lacking the physical courage which is vital in the air of Gascony, dared not struggle against his father, and consequently lost that faculty of resistance which begets moral courage.His thwarted feelings were driven to the depths of his heart, where they remained without expression; later, when he felt them to be out of harmony with the maxims of the world, he could only think rightly and act mistakenly.He was capable of fighting for a mere word or look, yet he trembled at the thought of dismissing a servant,—his timidity showing itself in those contests only which required a persistent will.Capable of doing great things to fly from persecution, he would never have prevented it by systematic opposition, nor have faced it with the steady employment of force of will.Timid in thought, bold in actions, he long preserved that inward simplicity which makes a man the dupe and the voluntary victim of things against which certain souls hesitate to revolt, preferring to endure them rather than complain.He was, in point of fact, imprisoned by his father’s old mansion, for he had not enough money to consort with young men; he envied their pleasures while unable to share them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位老绅士每天晚上带着他儿子去拜访保皇党人的家。他们乘坐一辆旧马车，由几匹套着破烂马具的老马拉着。随行的老仆人衣衫不整。在那里，他会遇到穿袍贵族和佩剑贵族的遗老遗少。自大革命之后，这两派贵族联合起来，如今他们已经转变成拥有土地的贵族了。沿海大城市不断膨胀的财富将波尔多的圣日耳曼地区压得喘不过气来。对于当时商界、政界和军界的大肆铺张浪费，那里的人们表示不屑和蔑视。保尔还太年轻了，无法理解在他们创造的表象设想下潜藏的这些社会差异和必然的社会现象。他觉得呆在一群老古董中枯燥得要命。殊不知，正是他年轻时期建立的关系保证了他最终优越的贵族地位，而这正是法国人永恒的渴望。</td>
		<td class="en">The old gentleman took him every evening, in an old carriage drawn by ill-harnessed old horses, attended by ill-dressed old servants, to royalist houses, where he met a society composed of the relics of the parliamentary nobility and the martial nobility.These two nobilities coalescing after the Revolution, had now transformed themselves into a landed aristocracy.Crushed by the vast and swelling fortunes of the maritime cities, this Faubourg Saint–Germain of Bordeaux responded by lofty disdain to the sumptuous displays of commerce, government administrations, and the military.Too young to understand social distinctions and the necessities underlying the apparent assumption which they create, Paul was bored to death among these ancients, unaware that the connections of his youth would eventually secure to him that aristocratic preeminence which Frenchmen will forever desire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在那些枯燥的晚间聚会上，他找到了些小小的补偿，那是年轻人喜欢的事情，也是他父亲命令他练就的一些本领。这位老绅士认为，在这个世道上，一个年轻人要成为一名完美的绅士，就必须通晓剑术，会用武器，马术精湛，会打网球，礼数周到——总而言之，就是要将老贵族那一套无聊琐碎的东西都学会。于是，保尔每天上午练习击剑，然后练骑术或者室内手枪射击。剩下的时间，他便用来阅读小说，因为他父亲从来就不认可那些在现在看来对教育必不可少的更深奥的学科。</td>
		<td class="en">He found some slight compensations for the dulness of these evenings in certain manual exercises which always delight young men, and which his father enjoined upon him.The old gentleman considered that to know the art of fencing and the use of arms, to ride well on horseback, to play tennis, to acquire good manners,—in short, to possess all the frivolous accomplishments of the old nobility,—made a young man of the present day a finished gentleman.Accordingly, Paul took a fencing-lesson every morning, went to the riding-school, and practised in a pistol-gallery.The rest of his time was spent in reading novels, for his father would never have allowed the more abstruse studies now considered necessary to finish an education.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正当这种单调的生活变得越来越无法忍受的时候，他父亲离开了人世。父亲的去世代表着暴政的终结，否则说不定这种生活就会把这个可怜的年轻人给毁了。父亲死后，保尔继承了父亲守财奴般积攒下来的大量财产和打理得井井有条的土地庄园。但是他现在非常讨厌波尔多，也不喜欢朗斯特拉克，以前他父亲每年夏天就带着他从早到晚地在朗斯特拉克打猎。</td>
		<td class="en">So monotonous a life would soon have killed the poor youth if the death of the old man had not delivered him from this tyranny at the moment when it was becoming intolerable.Paul found himself in possession of considerable capital, accumulated by his father’s avarice, together with landed estates in the best possible condition.But he now held Bordeaux in horror; neither did he like Lanstrac, where his father had taken him to spend the summers, employing his whole time from morning till night in hunting.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >财产的事情一妥善处理好，这个渴望享受的年轻继承人就用自己的资金买了公债，将土地庄园交由父亲的公证人老马蒂亚斯打理，自己到远离波尔多的一个地方呆了六年。起先他在法国驻那不勒斯的大使馆当差，之后又先后到马德里和伦敦的公使馆当秘书——就这样走遍了整个欧洲。</td>
		<td class="en">As soon as the estate was fairly settled, the young heir, eager for enjoyment, bought consols with his capital, left the management of the landed property to old Mathias, his father’s notary, and spent the next six years away from Bordeaux.At first he was attached to the French embassy at Naples; after that he was secretary of legation at Madrid, and then in London,—making in this way the tour of Europe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在经历了诸多世面以后，在失去了许多幻想以后，在他父亲留给他的闲散资金被他挥霍一空以后，有一段时间，为了继续过那种生活，他不得已动用了他的公证人靠不动产积攒起来的收入。就在这个关键时刻，他突然在一个所谓的良性冲动的推动下，决定离开巴黎，回到波尔多来打理自己的事务。他在朗斯特拉克开始了贵族生活，经营自己的地产，结婚成家，并最终当上了众议员。</td>
		<td class="en">After seeing the world and life, after losing several illusions, after dissipating all the loose capital which his father had amassed, there came a time when, in order to continue his way of life, Paul was forced to draw upon the territorial revenues which his notary was laying by.At this critical moment, seized by one of the so-called virtuous impulses, he determined to leave Paris, return to Bordeaux, regulate his affairs, lead the life of a country gentleman at Lanstrac, improve his property, marry, and become, in the end, a deputy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >保尔当时是伯爵；那时贵族的称号对婚姻有重大的作用；他能够而且应该有个好婚事。虽然许多女子渴望嫁一个拥有贵族头衔的男人，但是也有很多女子想嫁一个有生活阅历的男人。如今，保尔在六年的时间里挥霍掉了七十万法郎，终于得到了一个官职。这个职务是买不到的，其实际价值也是无法用金银来衡量的。这个官职要求从事这个职务的人要经过长期的学习、见习和各种考试，要有朋友，有敌人，有熟人，要举止得体、风度翩翩，名号也要优雅悦耳——而且，还要懂得人情世故，这就意味着各种风流韵事、决斗、赛马场上赌输，要有失望、欺骗、烦闷、辛苦，以及许许多多难以消受的各种享乐。总而言之，他终于成为了一名所谓的“风雅之士”。不过，即使他生活奢侈，也从来未能跻身时髦人士之列。在当时荒诞可笑的上层人群中，时髦人士就相当于法国的元帅，而风雅之士只不过是少将的级别而已。保尔享受着他风雅的小名气，也知道如何保持这个名声。他的仆人衣着不俗，他的随行马车也颇为人称道，他的晚宴也很有排场。总而言之，在巴黎家产能与大户人家相比的也就只有七八个人，而保尔的单身汉别墅就名列其中。</td>
		<td class="en">Paul was a count; nobility was once more of matrimonial value; he could, and he ought to make a good marriage.While many women desire a title, many others like to marry a man to whom a knowledge of life is familiar.Now Paul had acquired, in exchange for the sum of seven hundred thousand francs squandered in six years, that possession, which cannot be bought and is practically of more value than gold and silver; a knowledge which exacts long study, probation, examinations, friends, enemies, acquaintances, certain manners, elegance of form and demeanor, a graceful and euphonious name,—a knowledge, moreover, which means many love-affairs, duels, bets lost on a race-course, disillusions, deceptions, annoyances, toils, and a vast variety of undigested pleasures.In short, he had become what is called elegant.But in spite of his mad extravagance he had never made himself a mere fashionable man.In the burlesque army of men of the world, the man of fashion holds the place of a marshal of France, the man of elegance is the equivalent of a lieutenant-general.Paul enjoyed his lesser reputation, of elegance, and knew well how to sustain it.His servants were well-dressed, his equipages were cited, his suppers had a certain vogue; in short, his bachelor establishment was counted among the seven or eight whose splendor equalled that of the finest houses in Paris.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是——他从来不招惹任何女人；他赌博从不输钱；他的好运也不是众人皆知；他为人太过正直，绝不会去欺骗或误导任何人，哪怕一个荡妇。他从来不把自己收到的情书乱摆乱放，也没有专门装此类信件的小盒子或是抽屉，以避免他的朋友一边等他系领带或刮胡子的时候，一边从小盒子里随意翻看那些信。另外，他不打算动用他在吉耶纳的地产，因此他没有年轻人那种用肆无忌惮的挥霍和浪费来引人注目的行为。他从不向人借账，却糊涂地把钱借给一些狐朋狗友。那些人后来不再搭理他，不再提及他，而且既不赞美他，也不诽谤他。这种杂乱的生活似乎是他特意规划出来的。他父亲以前对他的暴政是他养成这种性格的原因，而这种性格，在某种程度上，又使他成为了一个社会杂交品种。</td>
		<td class="en">But—he had not caused the wretchedness of any woman; he gambled without losing; his luck was not notorious; he was far too upright to deceive or mislead any one, no matter who, even a wanton; never did he leave his billets-doux lying about, and he possessed no coffer or desk for love-letters which his friends were at liberty to read while he tied his cravat or trimmed his beard.Moreover, not willing to dip into his Guienne property, he had not that bold extravagance which leads to great strokes and calls attention at any cost to the proceedings of a young man.Neither did he borrow money, but he had the folly to lend to friends, who then deserted him and spoke of him no more either for good or evil.He seemed to have regulated his dissipations methodically.The secret of his character lay in his father’s tyranny, which had made him, as it were, a social mongrel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是有一天清晨，他对一个朋友说：“亲爱的伙计，生活总得有点儿意义吧。”这位名叫德马尔赛的朋友后来成了一个名人。</td>
		<td class="en">So, one morning, he said to a friend named de Marsay, who afterwards became celebrated:—“My dear fellow, life has a meaning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你至少得活到二十七岁才能找到生活的意义。”马尔赛笑着答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“You must be twenty-seven years of age before you can find it out,” replied de Marsay, laughing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“瞧，我已经二十七岁，而且正因为我二十七岁了，我才打算到朗斯特拉克去过乡村贵族的生活。我想把东西搬到波尔多我父亲那所老房子里去。而这所房子我还是留着，每年我回巴黎在这里住三个月。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I am twenty-seven; and precisely because I am twenty-seven I mean to live the life of a country gentleman at Lanstrac.I’ll transport my belongings to Bordeaux into my father’s old mansion, and I’ll spend three months of the year in Paris in this house, which I shall keep.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你要结婚吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Will you marry?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是呀，我要结婚。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I will marry.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是你的朋友，你知道的，我的老伙计保尔，”德马尔赛沉默了一会儿说道，“我跟你说，你要是想安顿下来做一个好父亲、好丈夫的话，这辈子你肯定就成了别人的笑柄。如果你被人笑话，却能够幸福也就罢了，问题是你不会幸福的。你没有足以驾驭一个家庭的强有力的手腕。为你说句公道话：你是个完美的骑手；如何放送缰绳，如何拉紧缰绳，牢牢地驾驭一匹马，没人比你更在行了。但是我亲爱的兄弟，婚姻却是另外一码子事。依我看来，你会被德马内维尔伯爵夫人牵着鼻子走，即使不愿意也得快步前行，时常是飞奔而不是迈着小碎步，不一会儿就会坠下马来——是的，从马背上坠下来跌进阴沟，摔断你的双腿。听我的话。你在吉伦特河的产业每年会给你带来四万多法郎的收入。这很好。带上你的马匹和仆人，给你在波尔多的房子配上家具，你就是波尔多的国王了。你可以在那里颁布我们在巴黎实行的法令，把我们的那些蠢事传播出去。这非常好。你在外省纵情酒色，甚至有更蠢的行为，这都没关系，蠢事或许能让你成为一个名人。但是——不要结婚。今日的社会，有谁还去结婚呢？要么是商人，想扩充资本，或是想双双拉货有干劲；要么是农民，想多生几个孩子帮忙干活；要么是经纪人或公证人想要妻子的“嫁妆”来一起出钱买个职务；要么是那可怜的国王，要传宗接代来延续他们可怜的王朝。但是，我们没必要去钻这个套，你竟然要去趟这浑水！为什么你要去结婚呢？你应该把你的理由给你最好的朋友讲一讲。首先，如果你娶一个像你一样富有的女继承人，两个人每年八万法郎的收入可并不等于一个人四万法郎。因为生了孩子后，马上会变成三个人，四个人。你确定会爱上这个只会束缚你的愚蠢的德马内维尔家族吗？为人父母意味着什么，你难道一无所知吗？我的老保尔啊，婚姻是现在社会最愚蠢的自我牺牲。只有我们的子女能从中获利，只有等到他们的马儿啃着我们坟头的花儿，他们才会明白婚姻的代价。你哀思你的父亲吗？这个糟蹋了你的青春年华的暴君。你如何做才能确保你的儿女爱你呢？你为他们的教育操心，为他们的幸福铺路，你在必要的时候态度严厉，却会减少他们对你的好感。小孩们喜欢管教不严或花钱慷慨的父亲，后来他们又瞧不起这样的父亲。你会活在担心与藐视的夹缝中。一家之主不是想当好就能当好的。看看我们身边的朋友，告诉我，你希望哪一个做你的儿子。我们甚至见过不少子女使家门蒙羞。我亲爱的保尔，子女好比是最难看管的商品。你认为你的孩子会是天使。那好，就算是吧！你可曾听说过，单身汉与已婚男人的生活之间有条多么深的沟壑？听我说。作为一个单身汉，你可以对自己说：“发生在我身上的可笑的事也就那么一些，我不会再出丑了。别人怎么看我在于我自己的想法。”一旦结婚了，你就会陷入无限的可笑境地！作为一个单身汉，你的幸快乐掌握在自己手中，今天愿意享乐就享乐，明日没有它也可以。可如果你结婚了，就不能随心所欲了，快乐来了就必须接受，而哪天等你想要的时候，没有它你也得将就。如果结婚了，你就会变成一个蠢蛋，你会开始计算你的彩礼，你会开始与人谈论道德、公众利益和宗教信仰，你会认为年轻人毫无道德感而且十分危险。总而言之，你将会成为一个社会学者。真可悲！一个老光棍在临断气前挣扎着却喝不下女看护喂的一勺水，一边还有人等着继承他的遗产。可是比起已婚男人，他可要幸福得多。我就不列举所有在婚姻中还会发生的那些惹人心烦、令人无聊、让人烦躁、控制人、压迫人、迷惑人、让人麻木瘫痪的事情了。在婚姻的围城中挣扎的两个人朝夕相对，命运永远相连。他们有这样古怪的念头，自以为彼此相配。不说了，布瓦洛的话就不用再重复了，我们早就熟记于心。但是，你要是答应我下面的成姻方式，我就原谅你那荒唐的想法：“俨如王侯”地成婚；把你的财产限定继承；生两个法律意义上的子女，给你妻子留一栋房子，而且与你的房子完全分离；只在外出交际的时候才带上她，并且每次从外面旅行回来时提前寄信通知她。每年只要两万法郎就足够过上这样的生活。加上你的生活经历，就可以去娶一个渴望得到贵族头衔的富裕的英国女子。这种生活对于我来说才是真正的法国生活方式，是唯一可以得到一个女性尊重和友谊的生活，也是唯一把我们与普通大众区分开来的生活——总之，只有为了这样的生活，年轻人才应该放弃他的单身福祉。只有这样，德马内维尔伯爵才能为这个时代作出表率，超越凡人，至少也能当个内阁部长或驻外大使之类的。他不会被别人所笑话，既得到了婚姻所带来的社会利益，又享受了单身的特权。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m your friend, as you know, my old Paul,” said de Marsay, after a moment’s silence, “and I say to you: settle down into a worthy father and husband and you’ll be ridiculous for the rest of your days.If you could be happy and ridiculous, the thing might be thought of; but you will not be happy.You haven’t a strong enough wrist to drive a household.I’ll do you justice and say you are a perfect horseman; no one knows as well as you how to pick up or thrown down the reins, and make a horse prance, and sit firm to the saddle.But, my dear fellow, marriage is another thing.I see you now, led along at a slapping pace by Madame la Comtesse de Manerville, going whither you would not, oftener at a gallop than a trot, and presently unhorsed!—yes, unhorsed into a ditch and your legs broken.Listen to me.You still have some forty-odd thousand francs a year from your property in the Gironde.Good.Take your horses and servants and furnish your house in Bordeaux; you can be king of Bordeaux, you can promulgate there the edicts that we put forth in Paris; you can be the correspondent of our stupidities.Very good.Play the rake in the provinces; better still, commit follies; follies may win you celebrity.But—don’t marry.Who marries nowadays?Only merchants, for the sake of their capital, or to be two to drag the cart; only peasants who want to produce children to work for them; only brokers and notaries who want a wife’s ‘dot’ to pay for their practice; only miserable kings who are forced to continue their miserable dynasties.But we are exempt from the pack, and you want to shoulder it!And why DO you want to marry?You ought to give your best friend your reasons.In the first place, if you marry an heiress as rich as yourself, eighty thousand francs a year for two is not the same thing as forty thousand francs a year for one, because the two are soon three or four when the children come.You haven’t surely any love for that silly race of Manerville which would only hamper you?Are you ignorant of what a father and mother have to be?Marriage, my old Paul, is the silliest of all the social immolations; our children alone profit by it, and don’t know its price until their horses are nibbling the flowers on our grave.Do you regret your father, that old tyrant who made your first years wretched?How can you be sure that your children will love you?The very care you take of their education, your precautions for their happiness, your necessary sternness will lessen their affection.Children love a weak or a prodigal father, whom they will despise in after years.You’ll live betwixt fear and contempt.No man is a good head of a family merely because he wants to be.Look round on all our friends and name to me one whom you would like to have for a son.We have known a good many who dishonor their names.Children, my dear Paul, are the most difficult kind of merchandise to take care of.Yours, you think, will be angels; well, so be it!Have you ever sounded the gulf which lies between the lives of a bachelor and a married man?Listen.As a bachelor you can say to yourself: ‘I shall never exhibit more than a certain amount of the ridiculous; the public will think of me what I choose it to think.’Married, you’ll drop into the infinitude of the ridiculous!Bachelor, you can make your own happiness; you enjoy some today, you do without it tomorrow; married, you must take it as it comes; and the day you want it you will have to go without it.Marry, and you’ll grow a blockhead; you’ll calculate dowries; you’ll talk morality, public and religious; you’ll think young men immoral and dangerous; in short, you’ll become a social academician.It’s pitiable!The old bachelor whose property the heirs are waiting for, who fights to his last breath with his nurse for a spoonful of drink, is blest in comparison with a married man.I’m not speaking of all that will happen to annoy, bore, irritate, coerce, oppose, tyrannize, narcotize, paralyze, and idiotize a man in marriage, in that struggle of two beings always in one another’s presence, bound forever, who have coupled each other under the strange impression that they were suited.No, to tell you those things would be merely a repetition of Boileau, and we know him by heart.Still, I’ll forgive your absurd idea if you will promise me to marry “en grand seigneur”; to entail your property; to have two legitimate children, to give your wife a house and household absolutely distinct from yours; to meet her only in society, and never to return from a journey without sending her a courier to announce it.Two hundred thousand francs a year will suffice for such a life and your antecedents will enable you to marry some rich English woman hungry for a title.That’s an aristocratic life which seems to me thoroughly French; the only life in which we can retain the respect and friendship of a woman; the only life which distinguishes a man from the present crowd,—in short, the only life for which a young man should even think of resigning his bachelor blessings.Thus established, the Comte de Manerville may advise his epoch, place himself above the world, and be nothing less than a minister or an ambassador.Ridicule can never touch him; he has gained the social advantages of marriage while keeping all the privileges of a bachelor.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“My dear fellow,” replied de Marsay, “Boileau’s satire against women is a tissue of poetical commonplaces.Why shouldn’t women have defects?Why condemn them for having the most obvious thing in human nature?To my mind, the problem of marriage is not at all at the point where Boileau puts it.Do you suppose that marriage is the same thing as love, and that being a man suffices to make a wife love you?Have you gathered nothing in your boudoir experience but pleasant memories?I tell you that everything in our bachelor life leads to fatal errors in the married man unless he is a profound observer of the human heart.In the happy days of his youth a man, by the caprice of our customs, is always lucky; he triumphs over women who are all ready to be triumphed over and who obey their own desires.One thing after another—the obstacles created by the laws, the sentiments and natural defences of women—all engender a mutuality of sensations which deceives superficial persons as to their future relations in marriage, where obstacles no longer exist, where the wife submits to love instead of permitting it, and frequently repulses pleasure instead of desiring it.Then, the whole aspect of a man’s life changes.The bachelor, who is free and without a care, need never fear repulsion; in marriage, repulsion is almost certain and irreparable.It may be possible for a lover to make a woman reverse an unfavorable decision, but such a change, my dear Paul, is the Waterloo of husbands.Like Napoleon, the husband is thenceforth condemned to victories which, in spite of their number, do not prevent the first defeat from crushing him.The woman, so flattered by the perseverance, so delighted with the ardor of a lover, calls the same things brutality in a husband.You, who talk of marrying, and who will marry, have you ever meditated on the Civil Code?I myself have never muddied my feet in that hovel of commentators, that garret of gossip, called the Law-school.I have never so much as opened the Code; but I see its application on the vitals of society.The Code, my dear Paul, makes woman a ward; it considers her a child, a minor.Now how must we govern children?By fear.In that one word, Paul, is the curb of the beast.Now, feel your own pulse!Have you the strength to play the tyrant,—you, so gentle, so kind a friend, so confiding; you, at whom I have laughed, but whom I love, and love enough to reveal to you my science?For this is science.Yes, it proceeds from a science which the Germans are already calling Anthropology.Ah! if I had not already solved the mystery of life by pleasure, if I had not a profound antipathy for those who think instead of act, if I did not despise the ninnies who are silly enough to believe in the truth of a book, when the sands of the African deserts are made of the ashes of I know not how many unknown and pulverized Londons, Romes, Venices, and Parises, I would write a book on modern marriages made under the influence of the Christian system, and I’d stick a lantern on that heap of sharp stones among which lie the votaries of the social ‘multiplicamini.’But the question is, Does humanity require even an hour of my time?And besides, isn’t the more reasonable use of ink that of snaring hearts by writing love-letters?—Well, shall you bring the Comtesse de Manerville here, and let us see her?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">These, and other speeches said occasionally in the form of praise extinguished the desires that some men might have had to marry the beautiful Spanish girl.Queen of every ball, accustomed to flattery, “blasee” with the smiles and the admiration which followed her every step, Natalie, nevertheless, knew nothing of life.She lived as the bird which flies, as the flower that blooms, finding every one about her eager to do her will.She was ignorant of the price of things; she knew neither the value of money, nor whence it came, how it should be managed, and how spent.Possibly she thought that every household had cooks and coachmen, lady’s-maids and footmen, as the fields have hay and the trees their fruits.To her, beggars and paupers, fallen trees and waste lands seemed in the same category.Pampered and petted as her mother’s hope, no fatigue was allowed to spoil her pleasure.Thus she bounded through life as a courser on his steppe, unbridled and unshod.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Thus these reasons of propinquity, joined to reasons of self-love and a real passion which had no means of satisfaction except by marriage, led Paul on to an irrational love, which he had, however, the good sense to keep to himself.He even endeavored to study Mademoiselle Evangelista as a man should who desires not to compromise his future life; for the words of his friend de Marsay did sometimes rumble in his ears like a warning.But, in the first place, persons accustomed to luxury have a certain indifference to it which misleads them.They despise it, they use it; it is an instrument, and not the object of their existence.Paul never imagined, as he observed the habits of life of the two ladies, that they covered a gulf of ruin.Then, though there may exist some general rules to soften the asperities of marriage, there are none by which they can be accurately foreseen and evaded.When trouble arises between two persons who have undertaken to render life agreeable and easy to each other, it comes from the contact of continual intimacy, which, of course, does not exist between young people before they marry, and will never exist so long as our present social laws and customs prevail in France.All is more or less deception between the two young persons about to take each other for life,—an innocent and involuntary deception, it is true.Each endeavors to appear in a favorable light; both take a tone and attitude conveying a more favorable idea of their nature than they are able to maintain in after years.Real life, like the weather, is made up of gray and cloudy days alternating with those when the sun shines and the fields are gay.Young people, however, exhibit fine weather and no clouds.Later they attribute to marriage the evils inherent in life itself; for there is in man a disposition to lay the blame of his own misery on the persons and things that surround him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But in Maitre Mathias, mind had triumphed over form; the qualities of his soul had vanquished the oddities of his body.The inhabitants of Bordeaux, as a rule, testified a friendly respect and a deference that was full of esteem for him.The old man’s voice went to their hearts and sounded there with the eloquence of uprightness.His craft consisted in going straight to the fact, overturning all subterfuge and evil devices by plain questionings.His quick perception, his long training in his profession gave him that divining sense which goes to the depths of conscience and reads its secret thoughts.Though grave and deliberate in business, the patriarch could be gay with the gaiety of our ancestors.He could risk a song after dinner, enjoy all family festivities, celebrate the birthdays of grandmothers and children, and bury with due solemnity the Christmas log.He loved to send presents at New Year, and eggs at Easter; he believed in the duties of a godfather, and never deserted the customs which colored the life of the olden time.Maitre Mathias was a noble and venerable relic of the notaries, obscure great men, who gave no receipt for the millions entrusted to them, but returned those millions in the sacks they were delivered in, tied with the same twine; men who fulfilled their trusts to the letter, drew honest inventories, took fatherly interest in their clients, often barring the way to extravagance and dissipation,—men to whom families confided their secrets, and who felt so responsible for any error in their deeds that they meditated long and carefully over them.Never during his whole notarial life, had any client found reason to complain of a bad investment or an ill-placed mortgage.His own fortune, slowly but honorably acquired, had come to him as the result of a thirty years’ practice and careful economy.He had established in life fourteen of his clerks.Religious, and generous in secret, Mathias was found whenever good was to be done without remuneration.An active member on hospital and other benevolent committees, he subscribed the largest sums to relieve all sudden misfortunes and emergencies, as well as to create certain useful permanent institutions; consequently, neither he nor his wife kept a carriage.Also his word was felt to be sacred, and his coffers held as much of the money of others as a bank; and also, we may add, he went by the name of “Our good Monsieur Mathias,” and when he died, three thousand persons followed him to his grave.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The next day Elie Magus (who happened at that time to be in Bordeaux) obeyed Madame Evangelista’s summons, believing, from general rumor as to the marriage of Comte Paul with Mademoiselle Natalie, that it concerned a purchase of jewels for the bride.The Jew was, therefore, astonished when he learned that, on the contrary, he was sent for to estimate the value of the mother-inlaw’s property.The instinct of his race, as well as certain insidious questions, made him aware that the value of the diamonds was included in the marriage-contract.The stones were not to be sold, and yet he was to estimate them as if some private person were buying them from a dealer.Jewellers alone know how to distinguish between the diamonds of Asia and those of Brazil.The stones of Golconda and Visapur are known by a whiteness and glittering brilliancy which others have not,—the water of the Brazilian diamonds having a yellow tinge which reduces their selling value.Madame Evangelista’s necklace and earrings, being composed entirely of Asiatic diamonds, were valued by Elie Magus at two hundred and fifty thousand francs.As for the “Discreto,” he pronounced it one of the finest diamonds in the possession of private persons; it was known to the trade and valued at one hundred thousand francs.On hearing this estimate, which proved to her the lavishness of her husband, Madame Evangelista asked the old Jew whether she should be able to obtain that money immediately.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Madame,” replied Magus, “the finer the diamond, the longer we keep it unsold.The rarity of such investments is one reason for the high value set upon precious stones.As the merchant cannot lose the interest of his money, this additional sum, joined to the rise and fall to which such merchandise is subject, explains the difference between the price of purchase and the price of sale.By owning these diamonds you have lost the interest on three hundred thousand francs for twenty years.If you wear your jewels ten times a year, it costs you three thousand francs each evening to put them on.How many beautiful gowns you could buy with that sum.Those who own diamonds are, therefore, very foolish; but, luckily for us, women are never willing to understand the calculation.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">No bridal toilet was ever comparable with that of Natalie, whose beauty, decked with laces and satin, her hair coquettishly falling in a myriad of curls about her throat, resembled that of a flower encased in its foliage.Madame Evangelista, robed in a gown of cherry velvet, a color judiciously chosen to heighten the brilliancy of her skin and her black hair and eyes, glowed with the beauty of a woman at forty, and wore her pearl necklace, clasped with the “Discreto,” a visible contradiction to the late calumnies.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">To fully explain this scene, it is necessary to say that Paul and Natalie sat together on a sofa beside the fireplace and paid no attention to the reading of the documents.Equally childish and equally happy, regarding life as a cloudless sky, rich, young, and loving, they chattered to each other in a low voice, sinking into whispers.Arming his love with the presence of legality, Paul took delight in kissing the tips of Natalie’s fingers, in lightly touching her snowy shoulders and the waving curls of her hair, hiding from the eyes of others these joys of illegal emancipation.Natalie played with a screen of peacock’s feathers given to her by Paul,—a gift which is to love, according to superstitious belief in certain countries, as dangerous an omen as the gift of scissors or other cutting instruments, which recall, no doubt, the Parces of antiquity.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The clerk drank a glass of iced-water, Solonet and Mathias blew their noses, Paul and Natalie looked at the four personages before them, listened to the preamble, and returned to their chatter.The statement of the property brought by each party; the general deed of gift in the event of death without issue; the deed of gift of one-fourth in life-interest and one-fourth in capital without interest, allowed by the Code, whatever be the number of the children; the constitution of a common fund for husband and wife; the settlement of the diamonds on the wife, the library and horses on the husband, were duly read and passed without observations.Then followed the constitution of the entail.When all was read and nothing remained but to sign the contract, Madame Evangelista demanded to know what would be the ultimate effect of the entail.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Madame, an entail being an appanage, or portion of property set aside for this purpose from the fortunes of husband and wife, it follows that if the wife dies first, leaving several children, one of them a son, Monsieur de Manerville will owe those children three hundred and sixty thousand francs only, from which he will deduct his fourth in life-interest and his fourth in capital.Thus his debt to those children will be reduced to one hundred and sixty thousand francs, or thereabouts, exclusive of his savings and profits from the common fund constituted for husband and wife.If, on the contrary, he dies first, leaving a male heir, Madame de Manerville has a right to three hundred and sixty thousand francs only, and to her deeds of gift of such of her husband’s property as is not included in the entail, to the diamonds now settled upon her, and to her profits and savings from the common fund.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“In the first place, my dear child, the cause of the failure of married women who desire to keep their husbands’ hearts—and,” she said, making a parenthesis, “to keep their hearts and rule them is one and the same thing—Well, the principle cause of conjugal disunion is to be found in perpetual intercourse, which never existed in the olden time, but which has been introduced into this country of late years with the mania for family.Since the Revolution the manners and customs of the bourgeois have invaded the homes of the aristocracy.This misfortune is due to one of their writers, Rousseau, an infamous heretic, whose ideas were all anti-social and who pretended, I don’t know how, to justify the most senseless things.He declared that all women had the same rights and the same faculties; that living in a state of society we ought, nevertheless, to obey nature—as if the wife of a Spanish grandee, as if you or I had anything in common with the women of the people!Since then, well-bred women have suckled their children, have educated their daughters, and stayed in their own homes.Life has become so involved that happiness is almost impossible,—for a perfect harmony between natures such as that which has made you and me live as two friends is an exception.Perpetual contact is as dangerous for parents and children as it is for husband and wife.There are few souls in which love survives this fatal omnipresence.Therefore, I say, erect between yourself and Paul the barriers of society; go to balls and operas; go out in the morning, dine out in the evenings, pay visits constantly, and grant but little of your time to your husband.By this means you will always keep your value to him.When two beings bound together for life have nothing to live upon but sentiment, its resources are soon exhausted, indifference, satiety, and disgust succeed.When sentiment has withered what will become of you?Remember, affection once extinguished can lead to nothing but indifference or contempt.Be ever young and ever new to him.He may weary you,—that often happens,—but you must never weary him.The faculty of being bored without showing it is a condition of all species of power.You cannot diversify happiness by the cares of property or the occupations of a family.If you do not make your husband share your social interests, if you do not keep him amused you will fall into a dismal apathy.Then begins the SPLEEN of love.But a man will always love the woman who amuses him and keeps him happy.To give happiness and to receive it are two lines of feminine conduct which are separated by a gulf.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A fortunate accident settled the question of my setting out on this career, which did not particularly smile on me, for you know my predilection for the life of the East.After thirty-five years of slumber, my highly-respected mother woke up to the recollection that she had a son who might do her honor.Often when a vine-stock is eradicated, some years after shoots come up to the surface of the ground; well, my dear boy, my mother had almost torn me up by the roots from her heart, and I sprouted again in her head.At the age of fifty-eight, she thinks herself old enough to think no more of any men but her son.At this juncture she has met in some hot-water cauldron, at I know not what baths, a delightful old maid—English, with two hundred and forty thousand francs a year; and, like a good mother, she has inspired her with an audacious ambition to become my wife.A maid of six-and-thirty, my word!Brought up in the strictest puritanical principles, a steady sitting hen, who maintains that unfaithful wives should be publicly burnt.‘Where will you find wood enough?’ I asked her.I could have sent her to the devil, for two hundred and forty thousand francs a year are no equivalent for liberty, nor a fair price for my physical and moral worth and my prospects.But she is the sole heiress of a gouty old fellow, some London brewer, who within a calculable time will leave her a fortune equal at least to what the sweet creature has already.Added to these advantages, she has a red nose, the eyes of a dead goat, a waist that makes one fear lest she should break into three pieces if she falls down, and the coloring of a badly painted doll.But—she is delightfully economical; but—she will adore her husband, do what he will; but—she has the English gift; she will manage my house, my stables, my servants, my estates better than any steward.She has all the dignity of virtue; she holds herself as erect as a confidante on the stage of the Francais; nothing will persuade me that she has not been impaled and the shaft broken off in her body.Miss Stevens is, however, fair enough to be not too unpleasing if I must positively marry her.But—and this to me is truly pathetic—she has the hands of a woman as immaculate as the sacred ark; they are so red that I have not yet hit on any way to whiten them that will not be too costly, and I have no idea how to fine down her fingers, which are like sausages.Yes; she evidently belongs to the brew-house by her hands, and to the aristocracy by her money; but she is apt to affect the great lady a little too much, as rich English women do who want to be mistaken for them, and she displays her lobster’s claws too freely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过她不够聪明，这点倒符合我对女人的希望。如果还有女人比她还笨，我马上就会去找出来的。这个女子的名字叫蒂娜，她永远不会批评我，不会反驳我。我就是她的上议院、她的贵族院和她的下议院。总之，保尔，她就是英国天才无法否认的证据，她是英国工业巅峰所造出来的产品。无疑，她是在曼彻斯特的佩里制笔间和蒸汽机车工作间生产出来的。这个产品会吃会走，也许会生小孩，还会照顾小孩，将孩子们抚养成人。它像极了女人，可以达到以假乱真的地步。</td>
		<td class="en">She has, however, as little intelligence as I could wish in a woman.If there were a stupider one to be found, I would set out to seek her.This girl, whose name is Dinah, will never criticise me; she will never contradict me; I shall be her Upper Chamber, her Lords and Commons.In short, Paul, she is indefeasible evidence of the English genius; she is a product of English mechanics brought to their highest pitch of perfection; she was undoubtedly made at Manchester, between the manufactory of Perry’s pens and the workshops for steam-engines.It eats, it drinks, it walks, it may have children, take good care of them, and bring them up admirably, and it apes a woman so well that you would believe it real.</td></tr>
