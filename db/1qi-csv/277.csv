"历史上的大多数人物，对于后人来说都只是徒有虚名而已（那些因为炉边佳话口口相传或是因史书记载而名垂青史的人除外）。很少有人能像真人一样出现在我们的脑海中。历史学家或是传记作者传递给读者的讯息，就像是我们比照地图来熟悉一个国家——虽然详尽准确，能满足各种用途，却冰冷无味，完全没有风景画那般栩栩如生。这些缺陷在一定程度上还是可以得到纠正的，而且绝不会以牺牲事实真相为代价，尽管使用的方式必然会触犯到专业传记作家所标榜的精确严密。对年代久远已然锈蚀的材料进行抛光，或是重新描摹古代圆柱塔上早已模糊难辨的碑文，都必须获得许可。对于那些能够表明人物性格的往事，也都应当运用想象力进行加工，这样，所描述的人物才会跃然纸上，传神生动。本文对这位昔日地方长官（其名字即是本文的标题）的描述，将会趣味盎然，这倒不是源于他的性格特点，而是因为他的命运有些奇特。这些都应得到稍许关注。","Few of the personages of past times (except such as have gained renown in fireside legends as well as in written history) are anything more than mere names to their successors.They seldom stand up in our imaginations like men.The knowledge communicated by the historian and biographer is analogous to that which we acquire of a country by the map,—minute, perhaps, and accurate, and available for all necessary purposes, but cold and naked, and wholly destitute of the mimic charm produced by landscape-painting.These defects are partly remediable, and even without an absolute violation of literal truth, although by methods rightfully interdicted to professors of biographical exactness.A license must be assumed in brightening the materials which time has rusted, and in tracing out half-obliterated inscriptions on the columns of antiquity: Fancy must throw her reviving light on the faded incidents that indicate character, whence a ray will be reflected, more or less vividly, on the person to be described.The portrait of the ancient governor whose name stands at the head of this article will owe any interest it may possess, not to his internal self, but to certain peculiarities of his fortune.These must be briefly noticed."
"威廉·菲普斯爵士的身世与其早年生活，算得上是他日后变得显赫的一段不同凡响的序曲。他是一个枪匠的儿子，兄弟姐妹一共二十六人，他的父亲在肯纳贝克河口附近的一个边疆小村做生意，人们频繁的捕猎和打仗使他的生意很红火。在清教徒管辖范围内，以及政府能够管得到的任何地区，青年无论住在多么偏僻和荒凉的原野，都得接受常规的道德教育以及极不寻常的宗教教育。每一处清教徒的居留地，都是嵌进新大陆的旧世界。就像是吉迪恩手中的羊毛，从未被露水打湿：虽然被大漠的风沙吹来吹去，却没受到任何野蛮的摧残。但是缅因州和新罕布什尔州的第一批移民却完全是出于世俗的目的才搬过来的：他们的政府软弱无能，优柔寡断，时而名义上与邻近的殖民地联合，时而又宣告不安稳的独立。他们的地方长官不止一次被认为是无法无天的冒险家，只能在丛林中才能重拾他们在欧洲丧失的安全感。他们的牧师（不像在新英格兰其他地方那样受到无与伦比的尊敬）常常缺乏对宗教的热情，他们本应一心追寻美德，不受人类法律的束缚，不怕世俗的凌辱；但是关于这些圣人们离经叛道的可悲记载的确存在，若是说牧羊人的失职会导致羊群杂乱无序，那么这些牧师的失职只能说明东部区域的道德已然败坏。本文所要谈及的未来的地方长官就是在这样的背景下成长起来的；许多年后，他乘军舰随水陆两军同法军战斗；他还给人们指认自己长大的那片山区，当时他连读书认字都不会呢。他前半生和后半生的境况迥然不同，这源于环境的偶然改变。他还是个水手的时候，便获得了许可，可以在公海上自由航行，这一时期对他来说十分重要。在英国海军谋得军衔之后，他听说在伊斯帕尼奥拉岛的沿海有一艘古代的西班牙沉船，价值连城。当时人们传说沉入海底的黄金还在闪闪发亮，钻石幽幽放光，欢腾的巨浪让这些掠夺品在水里翻来覆去。于是威廉·菲普斯先生决定打捞宝贝（他得到某些贵族的主动相助，但他们声明要分得大头），没想到真的满载而归，即使与大家公平分摊后，他依旧是发了大财。海洋带给了他财富，陆地也应当为他增添荣光，果然，英王詹姆斯授予了他骑士爵位。荣归新英格兰之后，他自称对自己曾经所犯的过错表示忏悔（纵观他从出生到最近的生活轨迹，总能看到一些恶习的积淀），于是他接受了洗礼；当时正逢奥兰治王子继承王位，他便遵照第二号君主特许状就任了首届地方长官。自此，本文的序曲就已完结了，现在我们要试着来看看威廉爵士一天的生活，这里没有什么惊天动地的大事，因为历史没有留下这样的事迹供我们大肆渲染。","The birth and early life of Sir William Phips were rather an extraordinary prelude to his subsequent distinction.He was one of the twenty-six children of a gunsmith, who exercised his trade—where hunting and war must have given it a full encouragement—in a small frontier settlement near the mouth of the river Kennebec.Within the boundaries of the Puritan provinces, and wherever those governments extended an effectual sway, no depth nor solitude of the wilderness could exclude youth from all the common opportunities of moral, and far more than common ones of religious education.Each settlement of the Pilgrims was a little piece of the Old World inserted into the New.It was like Gideon’s fleece, unwet with dew: the desert wind that breathed over it left none of its wild influences there.But the first settlers of Maine and New Hampshire were led thither entirely by carnal motives: their governments were feeble, uncertain, sometimes nominally annexed to their sister colonies, and sometimes asserting a troubled independence.Their rulers might be deemed, in more than one instance, lawless adventurers, who found that security in the forest which they had forfeited in Europe.Their clergy (unlike that revered band who acquired so singular a fame elsewhere in New England) were too often destitute of the religious fervor which should have kept them in the track of virtue, unaided by the restraints of human law and the dread of worldly dishonor; and there are records of lamentable lapses on the part of those holy men, which, if we may argue the disorder of the sheep from the unfitness of the shepherd, tell a sad tale as to the morality of the eastern provinces.In this state of society, the future governor grew up; and many years after, sailing with a fleet and an army to make war upon the French, he pointed out the very hills where he had reached the age of manhood, unskilled even to read and write.The contrast between the commencement and close of his life was the effect of casual circumstances.During a considerable time, he was a mariner, at a period when there was much license on the high-seas.After attaining to some rank in the English navy, he heard of an ancient Spanish wreck off the coast of Hispaniola, of such mighty value, that, according to the stories of the day, the sunken gold might be seen to glisten, and the diamonds to flash, as the triumphant billows tossed about their spoil.These treasures of the deep (by the aid of certain noblemen who claimed the lion’s share) Sir William Phips sought for, and recovered, and was sufficiently enriched, even after an honest settlement with the partners of his adventure.That the land might give him honor, as the sea had given him wealth, he received knighthood from King James.Returning to New England, he professed repentance of his sins (of which, from the nature both of his early and more recent life, there could scarce fail to be some slight accumulation), was baptized, and, on the accession of the Prince of Orange to the throne, became the first governor under the second charter.And now, having arranged these preliminaries, we shall attempt to picture forth a day of Sir William’s life, introducing no very remarkable events, because history supplies us with none such convertible to our purpose."
"那是一个夏日的上午，长官刚刚到任后不久，正站在门口的阶梯上，准备去市里巡视。威廉爵士身体结实，接近中等身材，岁数则早已过了中年。他穿着深紫色的天鹅绒外衣，上面清晰地绣着花纹；他剑柄和手杖上的狮子头，都是由那艘西班牙沉船上的黄金铸就而成的。他模仿路易十四时期宫廷的装扮，头上戴着华丽的垂肩假发，一张脸被层层叠叠的卷发簇拥着，就像是一颗粗糙的鹅卵石，而那里放一颗钻石似乎更合适。这时大门里走出来两位男仆——一个是浑身乌黑发亮的非洲奴隶，另一个是英国的家奴，他们都已经跟随长官很多年了。只见威廉爵士走下台阶，迎面遇到三位黑衣长者，他们的神情庄重而严肃，给人的感觉就像是从墓地漫游而出的三块墓碑。他们其实是本地的牧师，其中大家都认得的是英克里斯·马瑟博士，前任本地派驻英王宫廷的官员，正是他举荐了咱们的威廉爵士，本届政府最得力的助手。双方此刻见面，免不了一顿点头哈腰和一阵生硬的寒暄。威廉爵士表明自己正急着回去，并正式邀请几位绅士，而这几位牧师则说不能妨碍长官出行；如此客气的争辩最后以两两组合的形式得以解决：威廉爵士和马瑟博士并肩走着，另外两位牧师走在队中，而之前提到的黑白二位家仆则跟在最后。他们商讨的事情，是如何处置塞勒姆城里的撒旦。城里的牧师们早已讨论过这一问题，而这三位杰出人士正是他们的副牧师，受委托前来表明一些有待商榷的观点，无非也就是劝告长官尽快采取有力措施来惩治被告。对于威廉爵士这个生在丛林中、长在大海上的人来说，他听惯了各路迷信的说法，所以现在十分乐于听从牧师们的建议。","It is the forenoon of a day in summer, shortly after the governor’s arrival; and he stands upon his doorsteps, preparatory to a walk through the metropolis.Sir William is a stout man, an inch or two below the middle size, and rather beyond the middle point of life.His dress is of velvet,—a dark purple, broadly embroidered; and his sword-hilt and the lion’s head of his cane display specimens of the gold from the Spanish wreck.On his head, in the fashion of the court of Louis XIV., is a superb, full-bottomed periwig, amid whose heap of ringlets his face shows like a rough pebble in the setting that befits a diamond.Just emerging from the door are two footmen,—one an African slave of shining ebony, the other an English bond-servant, the property of the governor for a term of years.As Sir William comes down the steps, he is met by three elderly gentlemen in black, grave and solemn as three tombstones on a ramble from the burying-ground.These are ministers of the town, among whom we recognize Dr. Increase Mather, the late provincial agent at the English court, the author of the present governor’s appointment, and the right arm of his administration.Here follow many bows and a deal of angular politeness on both sides.Sir William professes his anxiety to re-enter the house, and give audience to the reverend gentlemen: they, on the other hand, cannot think of interrupting his walk; and the courteous dispute is concluded by a junction of the parties; Sir William and Dr. Mather setting forth side by side, the two other clergymen forming the centre of the column, and the black and white footmen bringing up the rear.The business in hand relates to the dealings of Satan in the town of Salem.Upon this subject, the principal ministers of the province have been consulted; and these three eminent persons are their deputies, commissioned to express a doubtful opinion, implying, upon the whole, an exhortation to speedy and vigorous measures against the accused.To such counsels Sir William, bred in the forest and on the ocean, and tinctured with the superstition of both, is well inclined to listen."
"彼时这几位政教界的显贵们正在高高的房屋下行走，而各家的格子窗户都半开着，从光影朦胧的窗户里望去，可以看到不少清教徒少女们一本正经的脸庞，她们正在偷偷地注视着高贵的长官大人，并且对男人们可以光明正大地表示好奇感到无比羡慕。而此时，路中央又出现了一个同样感兴趣的人。这人穿着打猎的衬衫，印度长袜，还背着一支长枪。他的双脚湿漉漉的，貌似趟过许多内陆的湖泊或是溪流；他的衣服上还挂着些穿越荒野时留下的树叶和嫩枝。笔者若是没有真凭实据是不会如此记载的：他头上戴着他的战利品，那是一顶又长又直的黑色假发，是由他所杀死的残暴的敌人的头发制成的。这位冷酷又老气的异教徒站在国王街中央，一副不知所措的样子。长官对他认真地打量了一番，认出他是自己少时的玩伴，于是亲切地微笑并同他攀谈；长官不停询问自己的家乡近况如何，旧日的邻居们是否还健在，还言辞达意地谈到同是出生和生长在那条河边的两个人，命运却如此不同。分别时，总督将一枚马萨诸塞州造的一先令硬币塞到了那人的手里，那硬币上印有一株短粗的松树，查理国王还曾经将其错当成救过自己龙体的橡树。这时，周围的百姓都齐声赞扬这位长官的谦逊和慷慨，而长官自己正挥舞着他的金头拐杖阔步向前走去；他将这位戴着长直黑发的男子撇在身后，男子已明白无误地看出，现在的长官已然不是当年的玩伴了。","As the dignitaries of Church and State make their way beneath the overhanging houses, the lattices are thrust ajar, and you may discern, just in the boundaries of light and shade, the prim faces of the little Puritan damsels, eying the magnificent governor, and envious of the bolder curiosity of the men.Another object of almost equal interest now appears in the middle of the way.It is a man clad in a hunting-shirt and Indian stockings, and armed with a long gun.His feet have been wet with the waters of many an inland lake and stream; and the leaves and twigs of the tangled wilderness are intertwined with his garments: on his head he wears a trophy which we would not venture to record without good evidence of the fact, a wig made of the long and straight black hair of his slain savage enemies.This grim old heathen stands bewildered in the midst of King Street.The governor regards him attentively, and, recognizing a playmate of his youth, accosts him with a gracious smile, inquires as to the prosperity of their birthplace, and the life or death of their ancient neighbors, and makes appropriate remarks on the different stations allotted by fortune to two individuals born and bred beside the same wild river.Finally he puts into his hand, at parting, a shilling of the Massachusetts coinage, stamped with the figure of a stubbed pine-tree, mistaken by King Charles for the oak, which saved his royal life.Then all the people praise the humility and bountifulness of the good governor, who struts onward flourishing his gold-headed cane; while the gentleman in the straight black wig is left with a pretty accurate idea of the distance between himself and his old companion."
"同时，威廉爵士朝该城的码头方向走去。只见马路的另一边来了一位看上去十分英武的人，他穿着装饰浓重的海军制服，腰间晃着把短刀。这正是肖特舰长，他在一艘为英王效劳的护航舰上任指挥官，而该舰现在正停泊在港口上。威廉爵士一看到他就怒气冲冲，自顾自地向他走去，毫不理会马瑟博士的暗中示意。原来马瑟博士知道长官与舰长之间有矛盾，他们一直在争执威廉长官是否有权管理停靠在该城港口的国王麾下的军舰。威廉爵士一上来便直接挑明这一恼人的主题。而舰长的回答一点也不顺从，丝毫没有满足这位权贵长官的尊严，事情逐步升温；那几位牧师倚仗自己的身份做起和事佬，尽力调解纷争。就在这时，长官抡起他的拐杖，舰长也赶忙握住自己的剑柄准备拔剑，可是被马瑟博士抢先阻拦了。一时间脚步混乱，人声鼎沸，长官趁乱朝不悦的肖特舰长头上狠狠地敲了几棒。因此他采用武力进行了报复，也符合他之前林中汉子、海中浪子的身份；但是事后，为了弥补他堂堂长官所受的屈辱，他又将自己的对手送进了监狱。办完了这事，威廉爵士才脱掉自己的假发，擦去扭打时出的一头大汗，逐渐平静了下来，而后又咒骂了几句，就像锅里的水烧开之后，泡泡逐渐下沉。","Meantime, Sir William steers his course towards the town dock.A gallant figure is seen approaching on the opposite side of the street, in a naval uniform profusely laced, and with a cutlass swinging by his side.This is Captain Short, the commander of a frigate in the service of the English king, now lying in the harbor.Sir William bristles up at sight of him, and crosses the street with a lowering front, unmindful of the hints of Dr. Mather, who is aware of an unsettled dispute between the captain and the governor, relative to the authority of the latter over a king’s ship on the provincial station.Into this thorny subject, Sir William plunges headlong.The captain makes answer with less deference than the dignity of the potentate requires: the affair grows hot; and the clergymen endeavor to interfere in the blessed capacity of peacemakers.The governor lifts his cane; and the captain lays his hand upon his sword, but is prevented from drawing by the zealous exertions of Dr. Mather.There is a furious stamping of feet, and a mighty uproar from every mouth, in the midst of which his Excellency inflicts several very sufficient whacks on the head of the unhappy Short.Having thus avenged himself by manual force, as befits a woodman and a mariner, he vindicates the insulted majesty of the governor by committing his antagonist to prison.This done, Sir William removes his periwig, wipes away the sweat of the encounter, and gradually composes himself, giving vent to a few oaths, like the subsiding ebullitions of a pot that has boiled over."
"这会儿快到十二点了，三位牧师应邀到长官家享用午餐，一同前去的还有几位由旧特许状任命的参议员——他们都是英国清教徒的后裔，一直记得克伦威尔执掌新英格兰的日子。威廉爵士礼貌可嘉地主持着宴会，一会儿饭前祷告便做完了，桌布也撤掉了。接着，葡萄酒如同暖流一般流入他的心房，这美酒引起一种变化，就像一条在被施了魔法的身体上的奔腾的小溪。我们这个出身大海和荒野的蛮荒人士此刻坐在了长官庄严的座位上。他滔滔不绝地讲起自己在海军舰队和住在父亲小屋时的许多趣事，在他自己的兴致大涨的同时，他也发现他的客人们庄重的表情变得越来越奇怪。庆幸的是，一阵鼓乐和横笛的合奏打断了这场谈话。","It being now near twelve o’clock, the three ministers are bidden to dinner at the governor’s table, where the party is completed by a few Old Charter senators,—men reared at the feet of the Pilgrims, and who remember the days when Cromwell was a nursing-father to New England.Sir William presides with commendable decorum till grace is said and the cloth removed.Then, as the grape-juice glides warm into the ventricles of his heart, it produces a change, like that of a running stream upon enchanted shapes; and the rude man of the sea and wilderness appears in the very chair where the stately governor sat down.He overflows with jovial tales of the forecastle and of his father’s hut, and stares to see the gravity of his guests become more and more portentous in exact proportion as his own merriment increases.A noise of drum and fife fortunately breaks up the session."
"长官带着他的客人们赶着出门了，似乎要去处理什么大事件，其实他们是要去检阅城里的民兵队。一大群百姓已经在公地上聚集起来，都是全家出动，上至头发花白的老者，下至三岁小孩。男女老少们都兴趣盎然地观看这支保卫他们的军队；人群中还星星点点散布着一些深色皮肤的印第安人，他们披着毛毯，呆滞地望着这支将他们的种族一扫而光的军队。士兵们个个神色得意，斗志昂扬，因为他们知道人群中会有美人投来赞誉的目光，更不用提其他不太重要的让他们保持英武面貌的动机了，只是那些动机没有那么强劲，比如他们害怕被要求“骑木马”（一种骑术训练中非常令人厌恶的姿势——严格来说就是硬骑），或者做“从头到脚卧倒”式，姿势倒是简单，可就是不舒服。威廉爵士看出他们战术中的错误，便拔出剑来亲自指挥军队。几种乏味的队形变化完成之后，夜幕便开始降临，仿佛是一道灰暗迷离的面纱常年阻隔在军队和我们之间。士兵们排成一个中空的方形队列，军官站在中间，我们的长官阁下（这一点有约翰·邓肯的权威可以证明）双手扶着剑柄，以祈祷结束了当天的军事演练。","The governor and his guests go forth, like men bound upon some grave business, to inspect the train-bands of the town.A great crowd of people is collected on the Common, composed of whole families, from the hoary grandsire to the child of three years.All ages and both sexes look with interest on the array of their defenders; and here and there stand a few dark Indians in their blankets, dull spectators of the strength that has swept away their race.The soldiers wear a proud and martial mien, conscious that beauty will reward them with her approving glances not to mention that there are a few less influential motives to contribute to keep up an heroic spirit, such as the dread of being made to “ride the wooden horse” (a very disagreeable mode of equestrian exercise,—hard riding, in the strictest sense), or of being “laid neck and heels,” in a position of more compendiousness than comfort.Sir William perceives some error in their tactics, and places himself with drawn sword at their head.After a variety of weary evolutions, evening begins to fall, like the veil of gray and misty years that have rolled betwixt that warlike band and us.They are drawn into a hollow square, the officers in the centre; and the governor (for John Dunton’s authority will bear us out in this particular) leans his hands upon his sword-hilt, and closes the exercises of the day with a prayer."
