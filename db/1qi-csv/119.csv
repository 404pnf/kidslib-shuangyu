"辛格姆·鲍勃先生的文学生涯","Literary Life of Thingum Bob, Esq."
"——《呆头鹅》前任编辑自述作者：爱伦·坡","Late Editor of the “Goosetherumfoodle” By Himselfby Edgar Allan Poe"
"如今，我在一天天老去——既然我知道莎士比亚和埃蒙斯先生都已与世长辞——那么可能有一天我也会过世。因此，我觉得不妨退出文坛，依靠自己获得的荣誉来安享晚年。但是，我渴望通过留给后代一些有价值的东西来标志着我从文坛宝座上的退位，或许，最有意义的事情莫过于写出一番有关自己早期的文学生涯。的确，我的名字长期以来频繁出现在公众面前，我欣然承认我的名字无论在什么地方都能顺理成章地引起大家的兴趣，而且我也非常乐意做点儿事去满足大家这种强烈的好奇心。实际上，处在事业上升期的功成名就之人有责任在身后留下一些引导他人走向成功的路标。因此，我计划在当前这篇文章（我原想把题目定为《美国文学史备忘录》）里详细地描述一下我人生中最初那至关重要，却又虚弱蹒跚的几步，但那正是凭着这几步，我才最终到了通往名誉巅峰之路。","I am now growing in years, and—since I understand that Shakespeare and Mr. Emmons are deceased—it is not impossible that I may even die.It has occurred to me, therefore, that I may as well retire from the field of Letters and repose upon my laurels.But I am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary sceptre by some important bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, I cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my earlier career.My name, indeed, has been so long and so constantly before the public eye, that I am not only willing to admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere excited, but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has inspired.In fact, it is no more than the duty of him who achieves greatness to leave behind him, in his ascent, such landmarks as may guide others to be great.I propose, therefore, in the present paper (which I had some idea of calling “Memoranda to Serve for the Literary History of America”) to give a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering, first steps, by which, at length, I attained the high road to the pinnacle of human renown."
