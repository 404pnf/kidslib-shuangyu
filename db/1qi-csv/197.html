		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“只有这终会保留—— 他们历经磨难和困苦：这游戏中的经历都将是收获，尽管赌博的本钱已丢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“This out of all will remain—They have lived and have tossed: So much of the game will be gain, Though the gold of the dice has been lost.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们两个人一瘸一拐，费力地走下河沿，走在前面的那个人一度在乱石中打了个趔趄。他们又累又虚弱，脸上流露出憔悴而又坚毅的表情，这是长期经受苦难的结果。他们的肩上捆着毛毯裹成的沉重包袱。勒在额前的皮带帮忙撑着这些包袱。每人都扛着一支来复枪。他们弯腰前行，肩膀前倾，脑袋更加前倾，眼睛专注地盯着地面。</td>
		<td class="en">THEY limped painfully down the bank, and once the foremost of the two men staggered among the rough-strewn rocks.They were tired and weak, and their faces had the drawn expression of patience which comes of hardship long endured.They were heavily burdened with blanket packs which were strapped to their shoulders.Head-straps, passing across the forehead, helped support these packs.Each man carried a rifle.They walked in a stooped posture, the shoulders well forward, the head still farther forward, the eyes bent upon the ground.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我真希望我们藏在那个隐秘处的子弹有两三发在手边就好了。”走在后面的人说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I wish we had just about two of them cartridges that’s layin’ in that cache of ourn,” said the second man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的声音阴沉沉的，毫无感情。他毫无兴致地说着；走在前面的人一瘸一拐地走向白茫茫的小溪，没有回应，溪水流过岩石，激起片片白沫。</td>
		<td class="en">His voice was utterly and drearily expressionless.He spoke without enthusiasm; and the first man, limping into the milky stream that foamed over the rocks, vouchsafed no reply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一人紧跟其后。他们没有脱去鞋袜，然而河水冰冷——冻得他们脚腕发痛，双脚麻木。在有些地方，溪水冲到他们的膝盖时，他们两个人都摇摇晃晃，很难站稳。</td>
		<td class="en">The other man followed at his heels.They did not remove their foot-gear, though the water was icy cold—so cold that their ankles ached and their feet went numb.In places the water dashed against their knees, and both men staggered for footing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >跟过来的这个人在一个光滑的大石头上滑了一下，差点摔倒，但他狠命站住了，同时发出了一声痛苦的尖叫。他看上去头晕目眩，一边摇晃，一边伸出那只空着的手，仿佛想从空气中寻找支撑。当他终于站定后，又向前走去，但是又晃了一下，险些跌倒。于是他一动不动地站着，看着那个头都不回的人。</td>
		<td class="en">The man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder, nearly fell, but recovered himself with a violent effort, at the same time uttering a sharp exclamation of pain.He seemed faint and dizzy and put out his free hand while he reeled, as though seeking support against the air.When he had steadied himself he stepped forward, but reeled again and nearly fell.Then he stood still and looked at the other man, who had never turned his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他足足站了一分钟，好像在和自己做着斗争。然后他叫喊起来：</td>
		<td class="en">The man stood still for fully a minute, as though debating with himself.Then he called out:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我说，比尔，我扭伤脚腕了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I say, Bill, I’ve sprained my ankle.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔在白茫茫的溪水中摇摇晃晃地前行。他没有转过头来看。后面的这个人看着比尔前行，尽管他像往常一样面无表情，但是他的眼睛流露出如受伤的鹿一般的神情。</td>
		<td class="en">Bill staggered on through the milky water.He did not look around.The man watched him go, and though his face was expressionless as ever, his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔一瘸一拐地走上了对岸，仍头也不回地径直向前走。站在小溪里的这个人看着他。他的嘴唇微微抖动了一下，那撮遮住嘴巴的浓密而粗糙的棕色胡子也跟着很明显地抖动起来。他还伸出舌头舔了舔嘴唇。</td>
		<td class="en">The other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on without looking back.The man in the stream watched him.His lips trembled a little, so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered them was visibly agitated.His tongue even strayed out to moisten them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比尔！”他大声叫喊着。</td>
		<td class="en">“Bill!” he cried out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是一个坚强的人在痛苦中的恳切呼唤，但是比尔仍然没有回头。这个人看着比尔古怪地一瘸一拐着向前走，摇摇晃晃地慢慢登上一个缓坡，然后朝着低矮的小山上那隐隐约约的地平线走去。他一直看着他走过山顶，消失得无影无踪。他这才将目光移开，慢慢望向比尔消失后所留下的一片世界。</td>
		<td class="en">It was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress, but Bill’s head did not turn.The man watched him go, limping grotesquely and lurching forward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the soft sky-line of the low-lying hill.He watched him go till he passed over the crest and disappeared.Then he turned his gaze and slowly took in the circle of the world that remained to him now that Bill was gone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >靠近地平线的地方，太阳在微弱地燃烧着，几乎被无形的雾霭和水汽笼罩住，给人一种没有边际、无法捉摸的庞大而厚重的印象。这个人掏出手表，把重心放在一条腿上站着。此时是四点钟，但是在这种七月底或八月初的季节里——这一两个星期他也无法弄清楚具体的日期了——他知道太阳大致处于西北方向。他朝南边看去，知道那些荒凉的小山后面就是大熊湖；他也知道在那个方向，北极圈的禁区界线穿过了加拿大的瘠地冻原地带。他站立的这条小溪是科珀曼河的一条支流。科珀曼河北上先流经科罗内申湾，然后汇入北冰洋。他从未去过那个地方，但是他曾在哈得孙湾公司的地图上见过它。</td>
		<td class="en">Near the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly, almost obscured by formless mists and vapors, which gave an impression of mass and density without outline or tangibility.The man pulled out his watch, the while resting his weight on one leg. It was four o’clock, and as the season was near the last of July or first of August,—he did not know the precise date within a week or two,—he knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest.He looked to the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the Great Bear Lake; also, he knew that in that direction the Arctic Circle cut its forbidding way across the Canadian Barrens.This stream in which he stood was a feeder to the Coppermine River, which in turn flowed north and emptied into Coronation Gulf and the Arctic Ocean.He had never been there, but he had seen it, once, on a Hudson Bay Company chart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又审视了一遍他所置身的这一片世界。这不是令人振奋的景象。处处可见隐约的地平线。所有的小山都很低矮。没有树，没有灌木丛，没有草坪——什么都没有，唯有巨大而可怕的荒凉。这一切立刻使他的双眼流露出惊恐的神色。</td>
		<td class="en">Again his gaze completed the circle of the world about him.It was not a heartening spectacle.Everywhere was soft sky-line.The hills were all low-lying.There were no trees, no shrubs, no grasses—naught but a tremendous and terrible desolation that sent fear swiftly dawning into his eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比尔！”　他轻轻地叫着，一声又一声地叫着，“比尔！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Bill!” he whispered, once and twice; “Bill!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他蜷缩在白茫茫的小溪中，仿佛这种无边的巨大正在以一种不可抗拒的力量挤压着他，用其得意的威严残酷地击垮他。他开始像疟疾发作一样一阵颤抖，直到枪从手中滑落，溅起一片水花。这正好惊醒了他。他克服了恐惧，恢复了镇定，在水中摸索着找到了枪。他将包袱向左肩挪了挪，以减轻受伤脚腕的一部分负担。然后他缓慢而谨慎地继续走向河岸，因为疼痛而显得畏畏缩缩。</td>
		<td class="en">He cowered in the midst of the milky water, as though the vastness were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force, brutally crushing him with its complacent awfulness.He began to shake as with an ague-fit, till the gun fell from his hand with a splash.This served to rouse him.He fought with his fear and pulled himself together, groping in the water and recovering the weapon.He hitched his pack farther over on his left shoulder, so as to take a portion of its weight from off the injured ankle.Then he proceeded, slowly and carefully, wincing with pain, to the bank.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他没有停下。他发疯一般拼着命，不顾疼痛，沿着斜坡匆匆登上他同伴刚刚消失的山顶——样子比他一瘸一拐的古怪同伴更加怪异可笑。但是在山顶，他看到了一个毫无生气的浅谷。他再次与恐惧斗争，并克服了它，然后把包袱往左肩又挪了一下，蹒跚着走下斜坡。</td>
		<td class="en">He did not stop.With a desperation that was madness, unmindful of the pain, he hurried up the slope to the crest of the hill over which his comrade had disappeared—more grotesque and comical by far than that limping, jerking comrade.But at the crest he saw a shallow valley, empty of life.He fought with his fear again, overcame it, hitched the pack still farther over on his left shoulder, and lurched on down the slope.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >谷底一片潮湿，厚厚的苔藓像海绵一样紧紧贴着潮湿的地面。每走一步，水就从他的脚下喷溅出来。每次他抬起一只脚，苔藓就会发出吮吸声，仿佛湿润的苔藓不愿意放开他一样。他小心翼翼地穿过一片又一片的沼泽地，顺着比尔的脚印往前走，跨过大片苔藓里如小岛般突起的岩石。</td>
		<td class="en">The bottom of the valley was soggy with water, which the thick moss held, spongelike, close to the surface.This water squirted out from under his feet at every step, and each time he lifted a foot the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss reluctantly released its grip.He picked his way from muskeg to muskeg, and followed the other man’s footsteps along and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets through the sea of moss.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管他只身一人，但是他没有迷路。他知道，再往前走一点就会来到一个名叫”提青尼其立“的小湖，湖边是细小而枯萎的云杉与冷杉，当地人称那儿为"小棍之地"。一条小溪汇入这片湖里，溪水并不是白茫茫的。溪水中有灯芯草——这点他记得很清楚——但是没有浮木，他将沿着这条小溪一直走，直到其源头的分水岭处。他将跨过分水岭，走到另一条向西流的小溪的源头，再沿着这条小溪走到其注入迪斯河的地方。在那里，他会在翻过来的独木舟下面找到一个堆满石头的隐秘处。在这个隐秘处，有他的空枪所需的弹药、钓鱼钩、钓鱼线和一张小鱼网——所有捕猎食物的用具。此外，他还会找到面粉——不会太多——一块熏肉，还有一些豆子。</td>
		<td class="en">Though alone, he was not lost.Farther on he knew he would come to where dead spruce and fir, very small and weazened, bordered the shore of a little lake, the TITCHIN-NICHILIE, in the tongue of the country, the “land of little sticks.”And into that lake flowed a small stream, the water of which was not milky.There was rush-grass on that stream—this he remembered well—but no timber, and he would follow it till its first trickle ceased at a divide.He would cross this divide to the first trickle of another stream, flowing to the west, which he would follow until it emptied into the river Dease, and here he would find a cache under an upturned canoe and piled over with many rocks.And in this cache would be ammunition for his empty gun, fish-hooks and lines, a small net—all the utilities for the killing and snaring of food.Also, he would find flour,—not much,—a piece of bacon, and some beans.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔会在那里等他，然后他们将一起沿着迪斯河划船南下到大熊湖。他们会去大熊湖的南边，并一直朝南，直到到达马更些河。朝南，他们会一直向南走，这样冬天就追不上他们的脚步。即使湍流结冰，天气日益寒冷而干燥，他们也会朝南一直走到温暖的哈得孙湾公司的贸易站。那里有茂盛的参天大树，有取之不尽的食物。</td>
		<td class="en">Bill would be waiting for him there, and they would paddle away south down the Dease to the Great Bear Lake.And south across the lake they would go, ever south, till they gained the Mackenzie.And south, still south, they would go, while the winter raced vainly after them, and the ice formed in the eddies, and the days grew chill and crisp, south to some warm Hudson Bay Company post, where timber grew tall and generous and there was grub without end.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个人边挣扎向前，边这样想着。但正如他的身体在艰难前行一般，他脑子也同样在挣扎着，努力想着比尔没有抛弃他，比尔一定会在那个隐秘处等他。他不得不这样想，不然他就用不着这么拼命，早就躺下来一命呜呼了。随着光线暗淡的、球形一样的太阳在西北方下沉，他反复多次地回想着冬天之前，他和比尔南方之行的每一寸路。他反复地想着隐秘处和哈得孙湾公司的贸易站的食物。他已经两天没有进食了；而至于自己想吃的食物，就更久没有吃到了。经常，他猫着腰在沼泽地上捡一些灰白色的沼地浆果，把它们塞到嘴里，嚼几下就吞进肚里。这种浆果只是一小粒带点浆汁的种子。浆汁入口即化，种子嚼起来的味道很冲，很苦。他知道这种浆果没有营养，但他心中怀有强烈的求生愿望，这愿望使他不顾常识和经验，耐心地咀嚼着浆果。</td>
		<td class="en">These were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward.But hard as he strove with his body, he strove equally hard with his mind, trying to think that Bill had not deserted him, that Bill would surely wait for him at the cache.He was compelled to think this thought, or else there would not be any use to strive, and he would have lain down and died.And as the dim ball of the sun sank slowly into the northwest he covered every inch—and many times—of his and Bill’s flight south before the downcoming winter.And he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of the Hudson Bay Company post over and over again.He had not eaten for two days; for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat. Often he stooped and picked pale muskeg berries, put them into his mouth, and chewed and swallowed them.A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water.In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter.The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >九点钟时，他的脚趾踢到了一块突起的岩石，加上他的身体极度疲劳和虚弱，他踉跄着跌倒了。他一动不动，侧着身体躺了一会。然后，他卸下系在身上的包袱，笨拙地拖着自己坐了起来。天还没有完全黑，借着流连的暮色，他摸索着寻找泥岩间的干苔藓片。等找到一堆（干苔藓）后，他生起了火——缓慢燃烧、没有火苗却冒着浓烟的火——他还在火上放了一马口铁罐的水烧着。</td>
		<td class="en">At nine o’clock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge, and from sheer weariness and weakness staggered and fell.He lay for some time, without movement, on his side.Then he slipped out of the pack-straps and clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture.It was not yet dark, and in the lingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds of dry moss.When he had gathered a heap he built a fire,—a smouldering, smudgy fire,—and put a tin pot of water on to boil.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他解开包袱后的第一件事就是数他的火柴。总共是六十七根。他一连数了三遍，以确保准确无误。他将火柴分成了几份，用油纸包起来，将一份放进他的空烟袋中，一份放进他磨损了的帽沿中，还有一份放在衬衫里贴着胸口的地方。做完这一切后，他突然感到恐慌，于是又打开所有的油纸包，数了一遍火柴。还是六十七根。</td>
		<td class="en">He unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count his matches.There were sixty-seven.He counted them three times to make sure.He divided them into several portions, wrapping them in oil paper, disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch, of another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat, of a third bunch under his shirt on the chest.This accomplished, a panic came upon him, and he unwrapped them all and counted them again.There were still sixty-seven.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他将潮湿的鞋袜放在火边烘干。鹿皮鞋已经成了湿透的破布条。毡袜磨出了很多洞，他的脚也擦破了皮，流着血。脚腕也阵阵抽痛着，于是他仔细查看了一下。脚腕肿胀得和膝盖差不多粗了。他从两条毯子中的一条上撕下一根带子，死死绑住脚腕。他又撕下一些带子裹住脚，以代替鹿皮鞋和短袜。然后他喝下那壶热气腾腾的水，上好手表的发条，爬进两条毯子之间。</td>
		<td class="en">He dried his wet foot-gear by the fire.The moccasins were in soggy shreds.The blanket socks were worn through in places, and his feet were raw and bleeding.His ankle was throbbing, and he gave it an examination.It had swollen to the size of his knee.He tore a long strip from one of his two blankets and bound the ankle tightly.He tore other strips and bound them about his feet to serve for both moccasins and socks.Then he drank the pot of water, steaming hot, wound his watch, and crawled between his blankets.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他睡得像个死人一样。午夜短暂的黑暗来了又走。太阳从东北方升起——至少那里露出了些曙光，因为太阳被乌云遮住了。</td>
		<td class="en">He slept like a dead man.The brief darkness around midnight came and went.The sun arose in the northeast—at least the day dawned in that quarter, for the sun was hidden by gray clouds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >六点钟他醒了，静静地仰面躺着。他直直地盯着灰色的天空，知道自己饿了。当他撑着胳膊肘翻身时，一声大大的喘息惊动了他。他看到一头雄驯鹿正警惕而又好奇地注视着自己。这个动物距离他不过五十英尺远，他的脑海里立刻跳出鹿肉排在火上烤得咝咝作响的画面，还想到鹿肉的滋味。他机械地摸到没有弹药的枪，瞄准，扣下扳机。雄驯鹿哼哼着跑开了，蹄子奔过泥岩时发出嘚嘚的撞击声。</td>
		<td class="en">At six o’clock he awoke, quietly lying on his back.He gazed straight up into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry.As he rolled over on his elbow he was startled by a loud snort, and saw a bull caribou regarding him with alert curiosity.The animal was not mere than fifty feet away, and instantly into the man’s mind leaped the vision and the savor of a caribou steak sizzling and frying over a fire.Mechanically he reached for the empty gun, drew a bead, and pulled the trigger.The bull snorted and leaped away, his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the ledges.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个人咒骂着，扔掉空枪。他一边试着拖着身子站起来，一边大声地呻吟着。这是件既缓慢又费力的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">The man cursed and flung the empty gun from him.He groaned aloud as he started to drag himself to his feet.It was a slow and arduous task.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的关节就像生锈的铰链。关节在骨臼里艰难地运作着，难以灵活自如，一屈一伸都要完全凭借意志力才能办到。等他终于站住时，他又花了大约一分钟直起腰来，让自己能像人一样挺直地站着。</td>
		<td class="en">His joints were like rusty hinges.They worked harshly in their sockets, with much friction, and each bending or unbending was accomplished only through a sheer exertion of will.When he finally gained his feet, another minute or so was consumed in straightening up, so that he could stand erect as a man should stand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他爬上一座小山，查看了一下前方的情况。没有树，没有灌木丛，什么都没有，只有满地灰色的苔藓，地上零星散布着一些灰色的泥岩，还有几个灰色的小湖和几条灰色的小溪。天空灰蒙蒙的。看不到太阳，也看不到太阳的影子。他不知道哪里是北方，也忘记了昨晚是走哪条路来这里的。但是他并没有迷路。他清楚这一点。他很快就会到达那片小棍之地。他感觉它就在靠左的某个地方，不远了——可能越过下一座小山就到了。</td>
		<td class="en">He crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect.There were no trees, no bushes, nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely diversified by gray rocks, gray lakelets, and gray streamlets.The sky was gray.There was no sun nor hint of sun.He had no idea of north, and he had forgotten the way he had come to this spot the night before.But he was not lost.He knew that.Soon he would come to the land of the little sticks.He felt that it lay off to the left somewhere, not far—possibly just over the next low hill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他回去整理好包袱，准备前行了。他确认了一遍那三包火柴都还在，不过并没有停下来去数。但他还是犹豫了一下，想着那个扁而厚实的鹿皮袋。它不算大。他用双手就可以将它遮盖起来。他知道袋子重十五磅——几乎和包袱里的其他东西一样重——因此他很犯难。最终他将袋子放在了一边，开始卷包袱。过了一会，他又停下来，盯着这个厚实的鹿皮袋。很快他捡起袋子，恶狠狠地看了周围一圈，仿佛这片荒凉正试图抢走袋子似的；他将袋子装入背上的包袱里，才站起身，摇摇晃晃地开始了一天的行程。</td>
		<td class="en">He went back to put his pack into shape for travelling.He assured himself of the existence of his three separate parcels of matches, though he did not stop to count them.But he did linger, debating, over a squat moose-hide sack.It was not large.He could hide it under his two hands.He knew that it weighed fifteen pounds,—as much as all the rest of the pack,—and it worried him.He finally set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack.He paused to gaze at the squat moose-hide sack.He picked it up hastily with a defiant glance about him, as though the desolation were trying to rob him of it; and when he rose to his feet to stagger on into the day, it was included in the pack on his back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他转向左边走去，时不时停下来吃点浆果。他的脚腕已经僵硬，走起路来也就更显得一瘸一拐的，但是这种痛苦比起他的饥饿之苦算不上什么。这种饥饿之苦异常强烈。饥饿之苦一直折磨着他，令他无法专注于去走那条通往小棍之地的必经之路。沼地浆果并没有缓解这种折磨，反而让他的舌头和上腭饱受刺激，火辣辣地疼。</td>
		<td class="en">He bore away to the left, stopping now and again to eat muskeg berries.His ankle had stiffened, his limp was more pronounced, but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the pain of his stomach.The hunger pangs were sharp.They gnawed and gnawed until he could not keep his mind steady on the course he must pursue to gain the land of little sticks.The muskeg berries did not allay this gnawing, while they made his tongue and the roof of his mouth sore with their irritating bite.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他来到一个山谷，许多石雷鸟扑打着翅膀从泥岩和沼泽地上惊起。它们发出阵阵“咯——咯——咯”的叫声。他向它们掷石头，但是一只也没有击中。他把包袱放在地上，像猫抓麻雀一样蹑手蹑脚地朝石雷鸟走去。锋利的石头刺破了他的裤腿，膝盖流出的血在地面上形成一道血痕；但是饥饿之苦让他忽略了这种疼痛。他在潮湿的苔藓上慢慢爬着，衣服湿透了，身体冻得冰凉；但是这些他都没有意识到，因为他极度地渴望吃东西。石雷鸟时不时地在他面前飞起，盘旋，到后来它们发出的“咯——咯——咯”的叫声在他看来简直变成了一种嘲笑。他咒骂着它们，大声吼着，这声音和石雷鸟的叫声混成一片。</td>
		<td class="en">He came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings from the ledges and muskegs.Ker—ker—ker was the cry they made.He threw stones at them, but could not hit them.He placed his pack on the ground and stalked them as a cat stalks a sparrow.The sharp rocks cut through his pants’ legs till his knees left a trail of blood; but the hurt was lost in the hurt of his hunger.He squirmed over the wet moss, saturating his clothes and chilling his body; but he was not aware of it, so great was his fever for food.And always the ptarmigan rose, whirring, before him, till their ker—ker—ker became a mock to him, and he cursed them and cried aloud at them with their own cry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一度爬到一只石雷鸟旁边，而这只石雷鸟很可能是睡着了。开始他并没有看见这只鸟，直到它从岩石的隐秘处飞起，直冲向他的脸。在这只鸟受惊飞起的同时，他也惊慌地伸手一抓，手里只抓住了它三根尾羽。当他看着鸟飞走时，他顿生恨意，仿佛这鸟做了很对不起他的事，令他受到了极大的委屈。然后他回去背起包袱。</td>
		<td class="en">Once he crawled upon one that must have been asleep.He did not see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook.He made a clutch as startled as was the rise of the ptarmigan, and there remained in his hand three tail-feathers.As he watched its flight he hated it, as though it had done him some terrible wrong.Then he returned and shouldered his pack.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一天就快要过去了，他来到了猎物较多的山谷，或者说沼泽地带。一群驯鹿走了过来，大约有二十多头，就在来复枪可以射中的范围内，相当诱人。他有种强烈的欲望去追逐它们，也相信自己一定能追到。一只黑色的狐狸叼着一只石雷鸟朝他走了过来。他大叫一声。这是一声令人惧怕的叫喊，狐狸受到惊吓逃跑了，但是并没有丢下石雷鸟。</td>
		<td class="en">As the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was more plentiful.A band of caribou passed by, twenty and odd animals, tantalizingly within rifle range.He felt a wild desire to run after them, a certitude that he could run them down.A black fox came toward him, carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth.The man shouted.It was a fearful cry, but the fox, leaping away in fright, did not drop the ptarmigan.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一动不动地躺了好一阵子。温暖的阳光洒在他身上，让那饱受磨难的身体沐浴在阳光的暖意中。是个好天气，他想。或许，他能够确定自己的位置。他吃力地翻过身来侧躺着。下面是一条缓缓流动的大河。这条河很陌生，让他困惑不已。他的目光缓缓地跟随着河流望去。只见它蜿蜒流过一段宽广的河道，河两岸的小山荒芜光秃，比以往见过的任何小山还要荒芜、光秃、低矮。他慢慢地、从容地顺着这条陌生的河流望向天边，没有激动之情，或者顶多是带着一种偶然的兴致。他看到河流汇入波光粼粼的大海。但他还是不激动。非常奇怪，他想，也许是幻象或是海市蜃楼——更有可能是幻象，是他错乱的神经捣的鬼。看到一艘船抛锚停泊在波光粼粼的大海中，他更相信这是幻象了。他闭了会眼睛，再睁开。奇怪的是，这种幻象竟依然存在！不过也不奇怪。他知道在这贫瘠土地的中心地带，是没有大海或者船只的，就像他知道他的空枪里没有子弹一样。</td>
		<td class="en">For some time he lay without movement, the genial sunshine pouring upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth.A fine day, he thought.Perhaps he could manage to locate himself.By a painful effort he rolled over on his side.Below him flowed a wide and sluggish river.Its unfamiliarity puzzled him.Slowly he followed it with his eyes, winding in wide sweeps among the bleak, bare hills, bleaker and barer and lower-lying than any hills he had yet encountered.Slowly, deliberately, without excitement or more than the most casual interest, he followed the course of the strange stream toward the sky-line and saw it emptying into a bright and shining sea. He was still unexcited.Most unusual, he thought, a vision or a mirage—more likely a vision, a trick of his disordered mind.He was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at anchor in the midst of the shining sea. He closed his eyes for a while, then opened them.Strange how the vision persisted!Yet not strange.He knew there were no seas or ships in the heart of the barren lands, just as he had known there was no cartridge in the empty rifle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他听到身后一阵抽鼻子的声音——像是喘不出气或是咳嗽的声音。因为极度虚弱和僵硬，他非常缓慢地翻了个身，换到另一侧躺着了。他看不到四周有什么东西，但是他耐心地等待着。再一次传来抽鼻子的声音和咳嗽声，他模模糊糊地看到一只灰狼的头，就在离他不到二十英尺远，两块凹凸不平的岩石之间。那双尖耳朵并没有像他以前见过的其他狼的耳朵一样竖得笔直；它的眼睛暗淡无神、充满血丝，脑袋似乎无力而愁闷地耷着。这只动物在太阳光下不停地眨巴着眼睛。它像是病了。当他看它时，它又发出了吸鼻子和咳嗽的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">He heard a snuffle behind him—a half-choking gasp or cough.Very slowly, because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness, he rolled over on his other side.He could see nothing near at hand, but he waited patiently.Again came the snuffle and cough, and outlined between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the gray head of a wolf.The sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on other wolves; the eyes were bleared and bloodshot, the head seemed to droop limply and forlornly.The animal blinked continually in the sunshine.It seemed sick.As he looked, it snuffled and coughed again.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">This, at least, was real, he thought, and turned on the other side so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled from him before by the vision.But the sea still shone in the distance and the ship was plainly discernible.Was it reality, after all?He closed his eyes for a long while and thought, and then it came to him.He had been making north by east, away from the Dease Divide and into the Coppermine Valley.This wide and sluggish river was the Coppermine.That shining sea was the Arctic Ocean.That ship was a whaler, strayed east, far east, from the mouth of the Mackenzie, and it was lying at anchor in Coronation Gulf.He remembered the Hudson Bay Company chart he had seen long ago, and it was all clear and reasonable to him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the afternoon the man came upon a trail.It was of another man, who did not walk, but who dragged himself on all fours.The man thought it might be Bill, but he thought in a dull, uninterested way.He had no curiosity.In fact, sensation and emotion had left him.He was no longer susceptible to pain.Stomach and nerves had gone to sleep.Yet the life that was in him drove him on.He was very weary, but it refused to die.It was because it refused to die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows, drank his hot water, and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他跟随着另一个人向前爬行的痕迹，不久就走到了痕迹的尽头——见到一些刚被啃光的骨头，这儿潮湿的苔藓上还留有狼群的脚印。他看到一个自己也有的那种厚实的鹿皮袋，不过袋子已经被锋利的牙齿撕裂了。袋子很重，他无力的双手很难提动，但他最终还是提了起来。这是比尔到最后一刻都随身携带的东西。哈！哈！他要嘲笑比尔。他要活下去，把袋子带到波光粼粼的大海里那艘船上去。他沙哑的笑声让人觉得可怕，像乌鸦嘎嘎的叫声，而那只病狼也跟他一起发出哀嚎声。突然，这人停住了。如果这些白里泛红、被啃光的骸骨是比尔的话；如果它们真是比尔的，他怎么能嘲笑他呢？</td>
		<td class="en">He followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself along, and soon came to the end of it—a few fresh-picked bones where the soggy moss was marked by the foot-pads of many wolves.He saw a squat moose-hide sack, mate to his own, which had been torn by sharp teeth.He picked it up, though its weight was almost too much for his feeble fingers.Bill had carried it to the last.Ha! ha!He would have the laugh on Bill.He would survive and carry it to the ship in the shining sea.His mirth was hoarse and ghastly, like a raven’s croak, and the sick wolf joined him, howling lugubriously.The man ceased suddenly.How could he have the laugh on Bill if that were Bill; if those bones, so pinky-white and clean, were Bill?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He turned away.Well, Bill had deserted him; but he would not take the gold, nor would he suck Bill’s bones.Bill would have, though, had it been the other way around, he mused as he staggered on.He came to a pool of water.Stooping over in quest of minnows, he jerked his head back as though he had been stung.He had caught sight of his reflected face.So horrible was it that sensibility awoke long enough to be shocked.There were three minnows in the pool, which was too large to drain; and after several ineffectual attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore.He was afraid, because of his great weakness, that he might fall in and drown.It was for this reason that he did not trust himself to the river astride one of the many drift-logs which lined its sand-spits.That day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by three miles; the next day by two—for he was crawling now as Bill had crawled; and the end of the fifth day found the ship still seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day.Still the Indian Summer held on, and he continued to crawl and faint, turn and turn about; and ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at his heels.His knees had become raw meat like his feet, and though he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he left behind him on the moss and stones.Once, glancing back, he saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail, and he saw sharply what his own end might be—unless—unless he could get the wolf.Then began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever played—a sick man that crawled, a sick wolf that limped, two creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the desolation and hunting each other’s lives.</td></tr>
