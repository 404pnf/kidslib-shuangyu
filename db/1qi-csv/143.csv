"一位健康的老人","A Fine Old Man"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"最近，约翰·瓦格纳，布法罗最年长的人——一百零四岁高龄的——在两周内步行了一英里半路程。","John Wagner, the oldest man in Buffalo—one hundred and four years old—recently walked a mile and a half in two weeks."
"他精力充沛，思维敏捷，就像报纸上长篇累牍、不厌其烦介绍的其他长寿老人一样，而且他无论在哪一方面都引人注目。","He is as cheerful and bright as any of these other old men that charge around so persistently and tiresomely in the newspapers, and in every way as remarkable."
"去年十一月，他曾冒着暴雨，只拿一把雨伞穿过五个街区（没有别的遮挡物），去给格兰特投上一票。他还说自己已经为美国四十七位总统投过票——这可是瞎话。","Last November he walked five blocks in a rainstorm, without any shelter but an umbrella, and cast his vote for Grant, remarking that he had voted for forty-seven presidents—which was a lie."
"昨天，他那头棕色浓密的“第二茬庄稼”从纽约运来，他还有一套新牙也快要从费城运来。","His “second crop” of rich brown hair arrived from New York yesterday, and he has a new set of teeth coming from Philadelphia."
"下周，他将和一名一百零二岁的姑娘完婚。那位姑娘还在从事洗衣的工作。","He is to be married next week to a girl one hundred and two years old, who still takes in washing."
"实际上，他们八十年前就已经订婚了，但他们的父母一直反对他们的婚事，直到三天前才同意。","They have been engaged eighty years, but their parents persistently refused their consent until three days ago."
"现在，约翰·瓦格纳比罗德岛上的寿星还大两岁。不过他这辈子可是没沾过一滴酒——除非——除非你把威士忌也当成酒。","John Wagner is two years older than the Rhode Island veteran, and yet has never tasted a drop of liquor in his life—unless—unless you count whisky."
