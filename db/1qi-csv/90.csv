"最后的行吟诗人","The Last of the Troubadours"
"作者：欧·亨利萨姆·加洛韦去意已决地跨上了他的小马。三个月的拜访结束以后，他即将离开阿迪托牧场了。如果有哪一位客人能在这里忍受三个月以上，那简直是不可思议：牧场上的咖啡里有麦子的味道，饼干由于没发酵好总有黄色条纹。那个大块头的黑人厨师尼克·拿破仑从来没能做出过好吃的饼干。尼克原来在威洛兰奇掌勺的时候，萨姆只在那里呆了六周，就被迫逃离了尼克掌控的厨房。","by O. HenryInexorably Sam Galloway saddled his pony.He was going away from the Rancho Altito at the end of a three-months’ visit.It is not to be expected that a guest should put up with wheat coffee and biscuits yellow-streaked with saleratus for longer than that.Nick Napoleon, the big Negro man cook, had never been able to make good biscuits.Once before, when Nick was cooking at the Willow Ranch, Sam had been forced to fly from his cuisine, after only a six-weeks’ sojourn."
"萨姆的脸上浮现出的悲伤，因遗憾而有所加深，又因不被人理解的内行所表现出的耐心宽容而稍稍缓和了一些。不过他还是坚决地扣紧马肚带，把拴马锁绕成圈挂上鞍头，把他的雨衣和大衣系在马鞍后弓上，并把他的马鞭系在右手腕上。梅里迪尤一家（阿尔蒂托牧场的场主）、男人们、女人们、孩子们、服务员、家仆们，还有客人、雇员、狗和碰巧来访的客人，都聚集在牧场宅院的走廊里，他们每个人的脸上都写满了哀伤和不舍。因为无论萨姆·加洛韦来到弗里奥河和北布拉沃河之间的哪一个牧场、营地或者小屋，快乐都会随他而至，所以他的离开会让人悲伤苦恼。之后，在一片全然的静寂中，萨姆小心而温柔地把他的吉他横搭在鞍上的雨衣和大衣上，只有一只猎狗为了掸下身上可恨的跳蚤，后腿碰到地面发出的声响。如果你理解放在绿色帆布袋子里的吉他对他的重要性，萨姆的身份也就昭然若揭了。","On Sam’s face was an expression of sorrow, deepened with regret and slightly tempered by the patient forgiveness of a connoisseur who cannot be understood.But very firmly and inexorably he buckled his saddle-cinches, looped his stake-rope and hung it to his saddle-horn, tied his slicker and coat on the cantle, and looped his quirt on his right wrist.The Merrydews (householders of the Rancho Altito), men, women, children, and servants, vassals, visitors, employés, dogs, and casual callers were grouped in the “gallery” of the ranch house, all with faces set to the tune of melancholy and grief.For, as the coming of Sam Galloway to any ranch, camp, or cabin between the rivers Frio or Bravo del Norte aroused joy, so his departure caused mourning and distress.And then, during absolute silence, except for the bumping of a hind elbow of a hound dog as he pursued a wicked flea, Sam tenderly and carefully tied his guitar across his saddle on top of his slicker and coat.The guitar was in a green duck bag; and if you catch the significance of it, it explains Sam."
"萨姆·加洛韦是最后的行吟诗人。当然你知道关于行吟诗人的事。据百科全书所说，他们在十一世纪到十三世纪之间非常活跃。他们让什么东西盛行似乎不甚明了——不过你可以相当地确定不是剑：也许是小提琴的琴弓，或者是一叉子意大利面条，又或者一条女士头巾。无论如何，萨姆·加洛韦是他们中的一个。","Sam Galloway was the Last of the Troubadours.Of course you know about the troubadours.The encyclopædia says they flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.What they flourished doesn’t seem clear—you may be pretty sure it wasn’t a sword: maybe it was a fiddlebow, or a forkful of spaghetti, or a lady’s scarf.Anyhow, Sam Galloway was one of ’em."
"当萨姆跨上小马背时，他的脸上出现了一种夸张的受难表情。不过他脸上的表情同他胯下坐骑的表情相比，可算欢快多了。你瞧，他的小马对它的主人简直了如指掌，它可能常常被草原上和拴马架前的矮种马嘲笑，因为它的主人是一个吉他手，而不是一个活跃的、爱说脏话的、友好的放羊牛仔。对于他的坐骑来说，谁都不是英雄。即使百货公司的电动扶梯绊倒一个行吟诗人，电梯也是可以原谅的。","Sam put on a martyred expression as he mounted his pony.But the expression on his face was hilarious compared with the one on his pony’s.You see, a pony gets to know his rider mighty well, and it is not unlikely that cow ponies in pastures and at hitching racks had often guyed Sam’s pony for being ridden by a guitar player instead of by a rollicking, cussing, all-wool cowboy.No man is a hero to his saddle-horse.And even an escalator in a department store might be excused for tripping up a troubadour."
"哦，我知道我是其中一个，而且你也如此。你记得你记忆中的那些故事、你学过的纸牌把戏，还有那支短小的钢琴曲——它是如何弹奏的呢？——叮咚叮咚叮咚——还有你拜访你有钱的简姑妈时提供的那些阿拉伯人的十分钟小娱乐。。你应知道“常人分为三类”。即：男爵、行吟诗人和工人。男爵无意于读像这篇这样胡说八道的文章。工人们则没有时间。所以我知道你一定是一个行吟诗人，而且你定会理解萨姆·加洛韦的。不管我们是唱歌、表演、跳舞、写作、演讲或是绘画，我们都只是行吟诗人；因此让我们对它持悲观态度吧。","Oh, I know I’m one; and so are you.You remember the stories you memorize and the card tricks you study and that little piece on the piano—how does it go?—ti-tum-te-tum-ti-tum—those little Arabian Ten Minute Entertainments that you furnish when you go up to call on your rich Aunt Jane.You should know that omnæ personæ in tres partes divisæ sunt.Namely: Barons, Troubadours, and Workers.Barons have no inclination to read such folderol as this; and Workers have no time: so I know you must be a Troubadour, and that you will understand Sam Galloway.Whether we sing, act, dance, write, lecture, or paint, we are only troubadours; so let us make the worst of it."
"那匹长了一张但丁·阿利吉耶里的脸的小马在萨姆双膝不同力度的夹压指引下，驮着浪迹四方的行吟诗人朝东南方跑了十六英里。大自然正处在最仁慈的状态中。一畦一畦精致而甜美的小花点缀在缓缓起伏的草原之上，馥郁的芳香弥漫其间。吹拂的东风缓和了春天的燥热；从墨西哥湾飘来的羊毛般洁白的云朵挡住了四月骄阳的直射光线。萨姆一边骑马一边唱歌。为了驱走那些鹿虻，他在马笼头下塞了一些小檞树树枝。有了这一皇冠，那个长着长脸的家伙比先前更像但丁了，而且从它的相貌看来，似乎让人想到比阿特丽斯。","The pony with the Dante Alighieri face, guided by the pressure of Sam’s knees, bore that wandering minstrel sixteen miles southeastward.Nature was in her most benignant mood.League after league of delicate, sweet flowerets made fragrant the gently undulating prairie.The east wind tempered the spring warmth; wool-white clouds flying in from the Mexican Gulf hindered the direct rays of the April sun.Sam sang songs as he rode.Under his pony’s bridle he had tucked some sprigs of chaparral to keep away the deer flies.Thus crowned, the long-faced quadruped looked more Dantesque than before, and, judging by his countenance, seemed to think of Beatrice."
"地形平坦，萨姆便径直奔向埃利森老头的牧羊场。此时去拜访牧场对他来说再理想不过了。在阿尔蒂托牧场上有太多人、太多噪音、太多争吵、太多竞争和混乱。他从来没有赏脸驾临埃利森老头的牧场，不过他知道自己定会受欢迎。行吟诗人到哪里都会畅行无阻。城堡里的工人为他放下吊桥，在宴会厅里，男爵会安排他坐到自己左手边的位置。在那里女士们对他展颜而笑，为他的歌声和故事鼓掌，而工人们则为他献上野猪头和大酒壶。如果坐在雕花木椅上的男爵打了一两次瞌睡，他也不是有意为之。","Straight as topography permitted, Sam rode to the sheep ranch of old man Ellison.A visit to a sheep ranch seemed to him desirable just then.There had been too many people, too much noise, argument, competition, confusion, at Rancho Altito.He had never conferred upon old man Ellison the favour of sojourning at his ranch; but he knew he would be welcome.The troubadour is his own passport everywhere.The Workers in the castle let down the drawbridge to him, and the Baron sets him at his left hand at table in the banquet hall.There ladies smile upon him and applaud his songs and stories, while the Workers bring boars’ heads and flagons.If the Baron nods once or twice in his carved oaken chair, he does not do it maliciously."
"埃利森老头殷勤地迎接他。他常听萨姆·加洛韦莅临过的其他农场主对他赞不绝口，从没想过自己卑微的男爵领地也会有此荣幸。我用男爵领地一词，是因为埃利森老头是最后的男爵。当然，布尔沃·利顿先生出生得太早，不曾知道埃利森老头的存在，否则他就不会把那个头衔加封给沃里克。男爵在生活中的责任和作用是为工人们提供工作，为行吟诗人提供庇护所。","Old man Ellison welcomed the troubadour flatteringly.He had often heard praises of Sam Galloway from other ranchmen who had been complimented by his visits, but had never aspired to such an honour for his own humble barony.I say barony because old man Ellison was the Last of the Barons.Of course, Mr. Bulwer-Lytton lived too early to know him, or he wouldn’t have conferred that sobriquet upon Warwick.In life it is the duty and the function of the Baron to provide work for the Workers and lodging and shelter for the Troubadours."
"埃利森老头是一个皱巴巴的老人，蓄着黄白色的短胡须，从他皱纹丛生的脸上能看出他过去笑起来的样子。他的领地是朴树丛中的一座两居室的小屋子，处于牧羊地带最荒凉的区域。他家里有一名基奥瓦男厨、四条猎狗、一只宠物羊和一头拴在篱笆桩上的半驯化的草原狼。他有三千头羊，放牧在两块租来的和几千英亩既不是租来的也不属于他的土地上。一年之中会有三四次和他语言相通的陌生人会骑马来到他家门前，和他无关痛痒地交流几句。那些对老头来说就是喜庆的日子。那些需要用金光闪烁、装饰华丽的大写字母浓墨重彩地诠释的日子，则必定是行吟诗人——行吟诗人，根据百科全书上所说，活跃于十一世纪到十三世纪——在男爵城堡前勒住缰绳的日子了！","Old man Ellison was a shrunken old man, with a short, yellow-white beard and a face lined and seamed by past-and-gone smiles.His ranch was a little two-room box house in a grove of hackberry trees in the lonesomest part of the sheep country.His household consisted of a Kiowa Indian man cook, four hounds, a pet sheep, and a half-tamed coyote chained to a fence-post.He owned 3,000 sheep, which he ran on two sections of leased land and many thousands of acres neither leased nor owned.Three or four times a year some one who spoke his language would ride up to his gate and exchange a few bald ideas with him.Those were red-letter days to old man Ellison.Then in what illuminated, embossed, and gorgeously decorated capitals must have been written the day on which a troubadour—a troubadour who, according to the encyclopædia, should have flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries—drew rein at the gates of his baronial castle!"
"看到萨姆时，埃利森老头的微笑回到了他皱纹丛生的脸上。他赶忙走出屋子，一瘸一拐地上前迎接。","Old man Ellison’s smiles came back and filled his wrinkles when he saw Sam.He hurried out of the house in his shuffling, limping way to greet him."
"“早上好，埃利森先生，”萨姆愉快的招呼道，“我想我应该来拜访您一下了。我注意到您的牧场今年雨水充盈。雨水会为早春的羔羊提供足够的嫩牧草了。”","“Hello, Mr. Ellison,” called Sam cheerfully.“Thought I’d drop over and see you a while.Notice you’ve had fine rains on your range.They ought to make good grazing for your spring lambs.”"
"“是，是，是，”埃利森老头说，“看到您我万分高兴，萨姆。我从没想过您能屈尊到访我这么偏僻老旧的牧场。但是热烈欢迎您啊。请下马吧！我的厨房里有一袋新收的燕麦——可以用来喂您的马吗？”","“Well, well, well,” said old man Ellison.“I’m mighty glad to see you, Sam.I never thought you’d take the trouble to ride over to as out-of-the-way an old ranch as this.But you’re mighty welcome.’Light.I’ve got a sack of new oats in the kitchen—shall I bring out a feed for your hoss?”"
"“喂它燕麦？”萨姆觉得这个想法着实可笑，“不，先生。它现在只吃草就已经胖得像头猪了。它运动量不够大，体形不太好。如果您不介意的话，我会给它拴上一条拖绳，把它放到马场上去。”","“Oats for him?” said Sam, derisively.“No, sir-ee.He’s as fat as a pig now on grass.He don’t get rode enough to keep him in condition.I’ll just turn him in the horse pasture with a drag rope on if you don’t mind.”"
"我确信在十一世纪到十三世纪之间，男爵、行吟诗人和工人从未像那晚在埃利森老头的牧羊场上那样相处得如此和谐。基奥瓦厨师做的饼干香酥可口，煮的咖啡口感醇厚。埃利森老头饱经风霜的脸上洋溢着由衷的好客之情与赞美之意。至于吟游诗人，他自言自语地说，无意之中竟真的来到了他的天堂。烹饪精美而丰盛的菜肴、无需费力就很容易取悦的牧场主，和他那时敏感而渴望安静的心，加在一起给了他周游其他牧场很少得到的满足感和奢侈的安逸感。","I am positive that never during the eleventh and thirteenth centuries did Baron, Troubadour, and Worker amalgamate as harmoniously as their parallels did that evening at old man Ellison’s sheep ranch.The Kiowa’s biscuits were light and tasty and his coffee strong.Ineradicable hospitality and appreciation glowed on old man Ellison’s weather-tanned face.As for the troubadour, he said to himself that he had stumbled upon pleasant places indeed.A well-cooked, abundant meal, a host whom his lightest attempt to entertain seemed to delight far beyond the merits of the exertion, and the reposeful atmosphere that his sensitive soul at that time craved united to confer upon him a satisfaction and luxurious ease that he had seldom found on his tours of the ranches."
"在享受过令人愉悦的晚餐之后，萨姆解开绿色的帆布袋，取出了他的吉他。请注意，他这样做并不是为了报答——不管是萨姆·加洛韦，还是其他真正的行吟诗人都不是已故的汤米·塔克的直系后人。你会在受人尊敬却鲜为人知的《鹅妈妈》的著作里读到汤米·塔克。汤米·塔克用歌声换取晚餐。但是现实中的行吟诗人却并不如此。他会在享用自己的晚餐之后为艺术歌唱。","After the delectable supper, Sam untied the green duck bag and took out his guitar.Not by way of payment, mind you—neither Sam Galloway nor any other of the true troubadours are lineal descendants of the late Tommy Tucker.You have read of Tommy Tucker in the works of the esteemed but often obscure Mother Goose.Tommy Tucker sang for his supper.No true troubadour would do that.He would have his supper, and then sing for Art’s sake."
"萨姆·加洛韦的节目是五十多个笑话和三四十首歌。他会的绝不止这些。不管你提到什么话题，他都能和你聊上二十支烟的功夫。能躺着的时候他从来不坐着；能坐着的时候他从来不站着。我有一种强烈的愿望，想和他多呆一会儿，因为我想用一支钝画笔和残缺的词汇所允许的能力范围内为他画一幅肖像。","Sam Galloway’s repertoire comprised about fifty funny stories and between thirty and forty songs.He by no means stopped there.He could talk through twenty cigarettes on any topic that you brought up.And he never sat up when he could lie down; and never stood when he could sit.I am strongly disposed to linger with him, for I am drawing a portrait as well as a blunt pencil and a tattered thesaurus will allow."
"我希望你们见过他：他矮小、结实，但懒散得无法想象 。他穿着一件前襟用珠灰色鞋带似的夸张带子系着的佛青色羊毛衬衫，一身用特别耐磨的棕色帆布料做的衣裤，一双带墨西哥式踢马刺的高跟靴，戴着一顶墨西哥式的宽边草帽。","I wish you could have seen him: he was small and tough and inactive beyond the power of imagination to conceive.He wore an ultramarine-blue woollen shirt laced down the front with a pearl-gray, exaggerated sort of shoestring, indestructible brown duck clothes, inevitable high-heeled boots with Mexican spurs, and a Mexican straw sombrero."
"那天晚上，萨姆和埃利森老头把椅子搬到了朴树下。他们点着烟；诗人愉悦地拨弄起他的吉他。他唱的许多歌都是古怪而忧郁的，都是从墨西哥牧羊人和牛仔那里学来的小调。其中一首尤其安抚了男爵孤独的灵魂，让他为之沉醉。那是一首牧羊人最喜欢的歌，以“飞吧，飞吧，小鸽子”开头的歌。那晚，萨姆把那首歌为埃利森老头唱了好多遍。","That evening Sam and old man Ellison dragged their chairs out under the hackberry trees.They lighted cigarettes; and the troubadour gaily touched his guitar.Many of the songs he sang were the weird, melancholy, minor-keyed canciones that he had learned from the Mexican sheep herders and vaqueros.One, in particular, charmed and soothed the soul of the lonely baron.It was a favourite song of the sheep herders, beginning: “Huile, huile, palomita,” which being translated means, “Fly, fly, little dove.”Sam sang it for old man Ellison many times that evening."
"行吟诗人留在了老头的牧场里。那里的宁静、安详和欣赏是他在喧闹的大养牛场里从未感受过的。这世界上没有任何听众对诗人、音乐家、艺术家的赞赏能够赶得上埃利森老头对他的赞许崇拜那样深切且持久。即使皇室名流屈尊来看一个卑微的伐木工或农民，都不会得到如此多悦人的感激和欢乐。","The troubadour stayed on at the old man’s ranch.There was peace and quiet and appreciation there, such as he had not found in the noisy camps of the cattle kings.No audience in the world could have crowned the work of poet, musician, or artist with more worshipful and unflagging approval than that bestowed upon his efforts by old man Ellison.No visit by a royal personage to a humble woodchopper or peasant could have been received with more flattering thankfulness and joy."
"在朴树树阴下凉爽的帆布小床上，萨姆·加洛韦度过了他大部分的时间。在那里，他用牛皮纸卷烟，读着牧场所能提供的那些无趣的文学类书籍，熟练地拨弄着他的吉他，即兴创作了一些歌曲，扩充他的节目。基奥瓦厨师像奴隶伺候奴隶主一样为他服务，为他取来树丛下挂着的红罐子里凉爽的水，他想吃饭时还给他送来吃的。草原上的和风温柔地吹拂着他；每当早晨和傍晚，嘲鸫都会鸣叫着和他的琴声一决高下，但是很难超越他美妙的音乐；一种高雅的平静似乎充盈在他的世界里。当埃利森老头骑着他那头时速一英里的小种马游荡在羊群中，当基奥瓦厨师在炙热阳光下在厨房的一角打盹时，萨姆却躺在他的小床上想他所生活的世界是多么美好、和善，生活对以给他人带来愉悦与快乐为人生使命的人们是多么仁慈。他在这里得到了他一直渴望的优质食物和住宿；完全不用操心、费力或者争吵；人们对他的欢迎持续不断，当主人第十六次听到同一支歌或者同一个故事的时候，还像第一次听到那样愉悦。古时候行吟诗人四海为家，可曾到过如此无以伦比的城堡？当他躺在这里，沉浸在他那美好的冥想中时,小小的棕色白尾兔羞怯地嬉戏于场院间；一队白色冠子、蓝色羽毛的鹌鹑一个接一个地跑出二十码外；一个出来捕食狼蛛的长尾鸟蹦到篱笆上摆动着它长长的尾羽向他行礼。在八十英亩的马场里，他那只长着但丁脸的矮种马长膘了，看起来似乎在笑。行吟诗人的浪迹天涯之旅终于在此止步。","On a cool, canvas-covered cot in the shade of the hackberry trees Sam Galloway passed the greater part of his time.There he rolled his brown paper cigarettes, read such tedious literature as the ranch afforded, and added to his repertoire of improvisations that he played so expertly on his guitar.To him, as a slave ministering to a great lord, the Kiowa brought cool water from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter, and food when he called for it.The prairie zephyrs fanned him mildly; mocking-birds at morn and eve competed with but scarce equalled the sweet melodies of his lyre; a perfumed stillness seemed to fill all his world.While old man Ellison was pottering among his flocks of sheep on his mile-an-hour pony, and while the Kiowa took his siesta in the burning sunshine at the end of the kitchen, Sam would lie on his cot thinking what a happy world he lived in, and how kind it is to the ones whose mission in life it is to give entertainment and pleasure.Here he had food and lodging as good as he had ever longed for; absolute immunity from care or exertion or strife; an endless welcome, and a host whose delight at the sixteenth repetition of a song or a story was as keen as at its initial giving.Was there ever a troubadour of old who struck upon as royal a castle in his wanderings?While he lay thus, meditating upon his blessings, little brown cottontails would shyly frolic through the yard; a covey of white-topknotted blue quail would run past, in single file, twenty yards away; a paisano bird, out hunting for tarantulas, would hop upon the fence and salute him with sweeping flourishes of its long tail.In the eighty-acre horse pasture the pony with the Dantesque face grew fat and almost smiling.The troubadour was at the end of his wanderings."
"埃利森老头是他自己的雇员。这就是说他没雇人，而是自己亲自为羊群驻地运送木材、水和粮食。这在小牧场经常发生。","Old man Ellison was his own vacϊero.That means that he supplied his sheep camps with wood, water, and rations by his own labours instead of hiring a vacϊero.On small ranches it is often done."
"一天早晨，他正出发前往英卡纳西翁·费利佩（他的牧羊人之一）的营地为他送本周日常用的褐豆、咖啡、食物和糖。在他离老尤因堡两英里的路上，他迎面碰上了一个骑着肯塔基种烈马的、叫金·詹姆斯的可怕之人。","One morning he started for the camp of Incarnación Felipe de la Cruz y Monte Piedras (one of his sheep herders) with the week’s usual rations of brown beans, coffee, meal, and sugar.Two miles away on the trail from old Fort Ewing he met, face to face, a terrible being called King James, mounted on a fiery, prancing, Kentucky-bred horse."
"金·詹姆斯的真名是詹姆斯·金；不过人们都把他的名和姓倒着念，是因为这样似乎更适合他，而且或许只是为了更加迎合他的权威。金·詹姆斯是圣安东的阿拉莫牧场和布朗斯维尔的比尔·霍珀酒馆之间最大的牧牛场主。而且他在德克萨斯西南也是最爱吵吵闹闹、最爱冒犯人的恶霸、最能吹牛的坏人。不管他什么时候吹牛了他总能成功；而且他造势越大，危险性越高。故事书里，那些眸子淡蓝、嗓音低沉、举止安静温良的人总会具有危险性；不过在现实生活中却不尽如此。如果让我在一个吵闹、身形魁梧的大汉和一个有着蓝色眸子、静静坐在角落的不具威胁性的人两者之中选择一个去挑衅的话，你会每次看到故事都是发生在角落里。","King James’s real name was James King; but people reversed it because it seemed to fit him better, and also because it seemed to please his majesty.King James was the biggest cattleman between the Alamo plaza in San Antone and Bill Hopper’s saloon in Brownsville.Also he was the loudest and most offensive bully and braggart and bad man in southwest Texas.And he always made good whenever he bragged; and the more noise he made the more dangerous he was.In the story papers it is always the quiet, mild-mannered man with light blue eyes and a low voice who turns out to be really dangerous; but in real life and in this story such is not the case.Give me my choice between assaulting a large, loudmouthed rough-houser and an inoffensive stranger with blue eyes sitting quietly in a corner, and you will see something doing in the corner every time."
"就像我之前想说的那样，金·詹姆斯是个性情凶猛、体重二百磅的金发男人，皮肤晒得像十月的草莓般粉红，蓬松的红眉毛下两道水平的细线算是他的眼睛。那天他穿着一件古铜色法兰绒衬衫，由于夏日阳光暴晒，他汗流浃背，衣服上的大片地方因汗渍的浸透而使得颜色变深了。似乎他身上还有其他的衣服和饰品，比如塞进大靴子里的棕色帆布裤子、红色手帕和左轮手枪；还有他横放在鞍前的一支霰弹枪和嵌满子弹的皮带，子弹在太阳下闪闪发光——但是你也许会忽略这些配饰；吸引你目光的只会是那两条他当作眼睛用的小缝。","King James, as I intended to say earlier, was a fierce, two-hundred-pound, sunburned, blond man, as pink as an October strawberry, and with two horizontal slits under shaggy red eyebrows for eyes.On that day he wore a flannel shirt that was tan-coloured, with the exception of certain large areas which were darkened by transudations due to the summer sun.There seemed to be other clothing and garnishings about him, such as brown duck trousers stuffed into immense boots, and red handkerchiefs and revolvers; and a shotgun laid across his saddle and a leather belt with millions of cartridges shining in it—but your mind skidded off such accessories; what held your gaze was just the two little horizontal slits that he used for eyes."
"这就是那个埃利森老头在路上遇到的人。当你站在男爵的立场，考虑他已经六十五岁，体重九十八磅，早就听说过金·詹姆斯的劣迹，因只想要过简单的生活和太平的日子，身边从来不带枪，即使带的话也不会用的时候；而且如果我告诉你，此时他脸上由行吟诗人带来的笑容完全消失，又恢复了过去那些丘壑的时候，你无法责难他什么。不过他不是逃避困难的那种男爵。他驱赶着自己那匹时速一英里的马（这并不困难），并向可怕的国王打招呼。","This was the man that old man Ellison met on the trail; and when you count up in the baron’s favour that he was sixty-five and weighed ninety-eight pounds and had heard of King James’s record and that he (the baron) had a hankering for the vita simplex and had no gun with him and wouldn’t have used it if he had, you can’t censure him if I tell you that the smiles with which the troubadour had filled his wrinkles went out of them and left them plain wrinkles again.But he was not the kind of baron that flies from danger.He reined in the mile-an-hour pony (no difficult feat), and saluted the formidable monarch."
"金·詹姆斯直截了当地挑明了自己的意思。“你就是那个在这片牧场上放羊的老懒汉，是吗？”他说，“你有什么权利放羊？你有土地吗，或者你租了些土地？”","King James expressed himself with royal directness.“You’re that old snoozer that’s running sheep on this range, ain’t you?” said he.“What right have you got to do it?Do you own any land, or lease any?”"
"“我从州政府租了两块地。”埃利森老头温和地说。","“I have two sections leased from the state,” said old man Ellison, mildly."
"“不，你没租，”金·詹姆斯说，“你的租约昨天到期了，我在土地局有人，到时立刻接手。在得克萨斯你没有一处立足之地。你们这些牧羊人必须马上离开。你们的日子到此为止。这是一个牧牛地，没有懒汉的地方。你放羊的这片草地是我的。我要架起一个宽四十英里、长六十英里的铁丝网；当铁丝网架好的时候，如果我发现里面有一头羊，它就死定了。我给你一周时间迁走。如果那时它们还在，我就会派六个人带着温彻斯特连发枪把这里的羊全部清光。如果那时我发现你还在，你就会得到这个。”","“Not by no means you haven’t,” said King James.“Your lease expired yesterday; and I had a man at the land office on the minute to take it up.You don’t control a foot of grass in Texas.You sheep men have got to git.Your time’s up.It’s a cattle country, and there ain’t any room in it for snoozers.This range you’ve got your sheep on is mine.I’m putting up a wire fence, forty by sixty miles; and if there’s a sheep inside of it when it’s done it’ll be a dead one.I’ll give you a week to move yours away.If they ain’t gone by then, I’ll send six men over here with Winchesters to make mutton out of the whole lot.And if I find you here at the same time this is what you’ll get.”"
"金·詹姆斯拍拍霰弹枪柄警示他说。","King James patted the breech of his shot-gun warningly."
"埃利森老头继续骑马前往英卡纳西翁的营地。他连声叹息，脸上的皱纹变得更深了。谣传称，旧规矩要改了，这事他早就听说了。自由放牧的日子即将终结。其他麻烦也接踵而至，堆积在他肩上。他的羊毛产量不增反减；羊毛的价格在每个剪毛季都下滑；甚至他在弗里奥城里采购牧场物资的商店老板布拉德肖也在催他结清这六个月以来的账单，要么就不再给他供货。最后，最大的灾难到来了，可怕的金·詹姆斯突然给他这一记最大的打击。","Old man Ellison rode on to the camp of Incarnación.He sighed many times, and the wrinkles in his face grew deeper.Rumours that the old order was about to change had reached him before.The end of Free Grass was in sight.Other troubles, too, had been accumulating upon his shoulders.His flocks were decreasing instead of growing; the price of wool was declining at every clip; even Bradshaw, the storekeeper at Frio City, at whose store he bought his ranch supplies, was dunning him for his last six months’ bill and threatening to cut him off.And so this last greatest calamity suddenly dealt out to him by the terrible King James was a crusher."
"当老头回到自己的牧场的时候，已是日落时分。他看见萨姆·加洛韦躺在床上，靠着一卷毛毯和羊毛袋，拨弄着他的吉他。","When the old man got back to the ranch at sunset he found Sam Galloway lying on his cot, propped against a roll of blankets and wool sacks, fingering his guitar."
"“嗨，本大叔。”行吟诗人兴高采烈地招呼着，“今晚您回来得早啊。我今天试着改编了一首西班牙方丹戈舞曲。我刚编好。就是这样——您听听。”","“Hello, Uncle Ben,” the troubadour called, cheerfully.“You rolled in early this evening.I been trying a new twist on the Spanish Fandango to-day.I just about got it.Here’s how she goes—listen.”"
"“那很好，很不错，”埃利森老头说，他坐在厨房的台阶上，捋着他白色的苏格兰猎狗似的胡子说，“萨姆，我想一旦路走不通了，您有顶替东西方所有音乐人的能力。”","“That’s fine, that’s mighty fine,” said old man Ellison, sitting on the kitchen step and rubbing his white, Scotch-terrier whiskers.“I reckon you’ve got all the musicians beat east and west, Sam, as far as the roads are cut out.”"
"“哦，我不知道，”萨姆沉思着说，“不过我在变调上确实如此。我认为我能像他们当中任意一个一样，完全能应付对五种降半音的调式。不过您看上去筋疲力尽，本大叔——今晚您不舒服吗？”","“Oh, I don’t know,” said Sam, reflectively.“But I certainly do get there on variations.I guess I can handle anything in five flats about as well as any of ’em.But you look kind of fagged out, Uncle Ben—ain’t you feeling right well this evening?”"
"“只是有点儿累，没事，萨姆。如果您未曾尽兴，让我们听听那首开头是‘飞吧，飞吧，小鸽子’的那支吧？好像那首歌在我每次赶了远路或者心烦的时候总让我觉得有一种抚慰和舒适之感。”","“Little tired; that’s all, Sam.If you ain’t played yourself out, let’s have that Mexican piece that starts off with: ‘Huile, huile, palomita.’It seems that that song always kind of soothes and comforts me after I’ve been riding far or anything bothers me.”"
"“哎呀，这是必须的，先生，”萨姆说，“只要你喜欢，我会随时弹给你听。而且，之前我忘记告诉你这件事了，本大叔，你该因为他们上次卖给咱们的火腿批评下布拉德肖他们。这火腿就是有点儿太老了。”","“Why, seguramente, señor,” said Sam.“I’ll hit her up for you as often as you like.And before I forget about it, Uncle Ben, you want to jerk Bradshaw up about them last hams he sent us.They’re just a little bit strong.”"
"一个居住在牧羊场的六十五岁老头，总被各种复杂的灾难困扰，无法很好地长期掩饰自己的烦恼。此外，行吟诗人本就对于自己的周围的环境很敏感——因为这干扰了他的安逸。所以，第二天，萨姆再一次问起老头为何一副忧心忡忡、心不在焉的样子。埃利森老头便对他讲了金·詹姆斯对他的威胁和勒令，对于破产的忧郁和这场灾难给他的打击充分显露了出来。行吟诗人听后沉思了。他之前也听过关于金·詹姆斯的不少事。","A man sixty-five years old, living on a sheep ranch and beset by a complication of disasters, cannot successfully and continuously dissemble.Moreover, a troubadour has eyes quick to see unhappiness in others around him—because it disturbs his own ease.So, on the next day, Sam again questioned the old man about his air of sadness and abstraction.Then old man Ellison told him the story of King James’s threats and orders and that pale melancholy and red ruin appeared to have marked him for their own.The troubadour took the news thoughtfully.He had heard much about King James."
"在暴君给的七天宽限期的第三天，埃利森老头驾着他的四轮马车去弗里奥城取一些牧场必备的物资。布拉德肖很顽固，但并不难以说和。他提供了老头购物单上的一半货物，而且同意再多给他一些时间。在那些担保的货物里面有一件东西是新的，一只新鲜的为了讨诗人喜欢而买的火腿。","On the third day of the seven days of grace allowed him by the autocrat of the range, old man Ellison drove his buckboard to Frio City to fetch some necessary supplies for the ranch.Bradshaw was hard but not implacable.He divided the old man’s order by two, and let him have a little more time.One article secured was a new, fine ham for the pleasure of the troubadour."
"在他回去的路上，也就是他刚走出弗里奥城五公里的时候，埃利森老头又遇上了金·詹姆斯骑马进城。他一向威风凛凛、不可侵犯、强横而又具有胁迫性，不过今天他两条细缝似的眼睛似乎比平常宽了些。","Five miles out of Frio City on his way home the old man met King James riding into town.His majesty could never look anything but fierce and menacing, but to-day his slits of eyes appeared to be a little wider than they usually were."
"“天气不错，”暴君粗暴地说，“我正想见你呢。”昨天我听一个来自桑迪的牛仔说你本来是来自密西西比州的杰克逊县。我想知道这是不是事实。”","“Good day,” said the king, gruffly.“I’ve been wanting to see you.I hear it said by a cowman from Sandy yesterday that you was from Jackson County, Mississippi, originally.I want to know if that’s a fact.”"
"“我生在那里，”埃利森老头说，“长在那里，直到我二十一岁。”","“Born there,” said old man Ellison, “and raised there till I was twenty-one.”"
"金·詹姆斯继续说：“他说他认为你和杰克逊县的里夫斯家是亲戚。他说的对吗？”","“This man says,” went on King James, “that he thinks you was related to the Jackson County Reeveses.Was he right?”"
"“卡罗琳·里夫斯，”老头说，“是我同母异父的妹妹。”","“Aunt Caroline Reeves,” said the old man, “was my half-sister.”"
"“她是我的婶婶，”金·詹姆斯说，“十六岁时候我从家里逃了出来。现在，让我们再次讨论一下我们几天前谈过的事情。大家都说我是恶人，不过他们只说对了一半。我的牧区有足够的草地来放牧你的羊群，以及它们以后长期的繁殖和发展。卡罗琳婶婶过去经常用羊肉和生面做羊肉烤饼给我吃。你在原来的地方放羊就好，而且只要你有想去放牧的牧区，尽管去就行了。你的经济状况如何？”","“She was my aunt,” said King James.“I run away from home when I was sixteen.Now, let’s re-talk over some things that we discussed a few days ago.They call me a bad man; and they’re only half right.There’s plenty of room in my pasture for your bunch of sheep and their increase for a long time to come.Aunt Caroline used to cut out sheep in cake dough and bake ’em for me.You keep your sheep where they are, and use all the range you want.How’s your finances?”"
"老头详细地说了他的困难，态度严肃体面而不失真真诚。","The old man related his woes in detail, dignifiedly, with restraint and candour."
"“她总是在我带去学校的饭篮里多放一些吃的——我是说卡罗琳婶婶，”金·詹姆斯说，“我今天路过弗里奥城，而且我会在明天回来的时候路过你的牧场。我要从那里的银行取两千美元送去给你；我会告诉布拉德肖，让他赊给你需要的所有东西。家乡的那句老话你一定听过，杰克逊县的里夫斯家和金家的关系永远都会比栗子树上的刺还要紧密相连。是的，只要我遇见里夫斯家的人，我还是姓金。所以明天大概太阳落山的时候，你留神等着我，什么都不用担心。不必担心干旱期会旱死所有的嫩草。”","“She used to smuggle extra grub into my school basket—I’m speaking of Aunt Caroline,” said King James.“I’m going over to Frio City to-day, and I’ll ride back by your ranch to-morrow.I’ll draw $2,000 out of the bank there and bring it over to you; and I’ll tell Bradshaw to let you have everything you want on credit.You are bound to have heard the old saying at home, that the Jackson County Reeveses and Kings would stick closer by each other than chestnut burrs.Well, I’m a King yet whenever I run across a Reeves.So you look out for me along about sundown to-morrow, and don’t worry about nothing.Shouldn’t wonder if the dry spell don’t kill out the young grass.”"
"埃利森老头高兴地返回牧场。笑容再一次填平了他脸上的丘壑。突然间，因为亲属关系的魔力和人们心中存有的善意让他的麻烦烟消云散。","Old man Ellison drove happily ranchward.Once more the smiles filled out his wrinkles.Very suddenly, by the magic of kinship and the good that lies somewhere in all hearts, his troubles had been removed."
"当他回到牧场的时候，他发现萨姆·加洛韦不在那里。他的吉他用鹿皮绳挂在朴树枝上，没有主人的琴弦在海湾微风的吹拂下，在风中呻吟，发出哀鸣。","On reaching the ranch he found that Sam Galloway was not there.His guitar hung by its buckskin string to a hackberry limb, moaning as the gulf breeze blew across its masterless strings."
"基奥瓦厨师试着解释。","The Kiowa endeavoured to explain."
"“萨姆骑马走了，”他说，“说是去弗里奥城。去干什么了不清楚。说是晚上回来。也许会。就这些。”","“Sam, he catch pony,” said he, “and say he ride to Frio City.What for no can damn sabe.Say he come back to-night.Maybe so.That all.”"
"当天空中第一颗星星升起的时候，行吟诗人回到了他的乐土。他把马放到了马场上，进了屋，靴子上的踢马刺发出好战的咔咔声。","As the first stars came out the troubadour rode back to his haven.He pastured his pony and went into the house, his spurs jingling martially."
"埃利森老头坐在餐桌旁，正在用铁皮杯子喝着晚饭前的咖啡。他看起来满足而愉悦。","Old man Ellison sat at the kitchen table, having a tin cup of before-supper coffee.He looked contented and pleased."
"“您好啊，萨姆。”他说，“看到您回来我真开心。不管怎么说，您的到来使一切欢乐起来，我真不知道以前没有您的时候牧场上的日子是怎么捱过来的。我打赌你准是被弗里奥城的一些小妞儿们缠住了，所以她们把你留到这么晚才让你回来。”","“Hello, Sam,” said he.“I’m darned glad to see ye back.I don’t know how I managed to get along on this ranch, anyhow, before ye dropped in to cheer things up.I’ll bet ye’ve been skylarking around with some of them Frio City gals, now, that’s kept ye so late.”"
"然后埃利森老头又瞅了一下诗人的脸，发现诗人变成了干实事的汉子。","And then old man Ellison took another look at Sam’s face and saw that the minstrel had changed to the man of action."
"当萨姆从他的腰间解下埃利森老头进城没有带着的六连发手枪的时候，我们不妨停下来说几句别的，不管何时何地行吟诗人放下吉他拿起剑的时候，那肯定是遇到麻烦了。我们畏惧的不是阿索斯专业的劈剑，也不是阿拉米斯冷酷的剑法，也不是波索斯的铁腕，而是加斯科涅的狂暴——诗人狂怒的和毫无章法的攻击——达太安之剑。","And while Sam is unbuckling from his waist old man Ellison’s six-shooter, that the latter had left behind when he drove to town, we may well pause to remark that anywhere and whenever a troubadour lays down the guitar and takes up the sword trouble is sure to follow.It is not the expert thrust of Athos nor the cold skill of Aramis nor the iron wrist of Porthos that we have to fear—it is the Gascon’s fury—the wild and unacademic attack of the troubadour—the sword of D’Artagnan."
"“我摆平了，”萨姆说，“我去弗里奥城摆平的。我不能让他欺负您，本大叔。我在萨默斯酒馆遇到了他。我知道该怎么办。我对他说了几句别人听不到的话。他先拔枪的——五六个人看到他这么做了——不过还是我占了先机。我给了他三枪——刚好在肺部周围，一个碟子就能盖住所有的弹孔。他不会再来骚扰您了。”","“I done it,” said Sam.“I went over to Frio City to do it.I couldn’t let him put the skibunk on you, Uncle Ben.I met him in Summers’s saloon.I knowed what to do.I said a few things to him that nobody else heard.He reached for his gun first—half a dozen fellows saw him do it—but I got mine unlimbered first.Three doses I gave him—right around the lungs, and a saucer could have covered up all of ’em.He won’t bother you no more.”"
"“你说的是——金——詹姆斯——吗？”埃利森老头抿了一口咖啡问。","“This—is—King—James—you speak—of?” asked old man Ellison, while he sipped his coffee."
"“您猜对了。他们把我送到县法官那儿；看见他先拔枪的目击者都在那儿。当然，他们让我在开庭前交三百美元保释金，不过当场有四五个人愿意为我作证。他再也不会找您的茬了，本大叔。您应该看看那几个弹孔挨得多么近。我认为像我这种经常弹吉他的人，手指在扣扳机时自然灵活一些，您不觉得吗，本大叔？”","“You bet it was.And they took me before the county judge; and the witnesses what saw him draw his gun first was all there.Well, of course, they put me under $300 bond to appear before the court, but there was four or five boys on the spot ready to sign the bail.He won’t bother you no more, Uncle Ben.You ought to have seen how close them bullet holes was together.I reckon playing a guitar as much as I do must kind of limber a fellow’s trigger finger up a little, don’t you think, Uncle Ben?”"
"除了基奥瓦厨师煎鹿肉排的溅油声外，城堡里一下寂静了。","Then there was a little silence in the castle except for the spluttering of a venison steak that the Kiowa was cooking."
"“萨姆，”埃利森老头用颤抖的手捋着白胡子说，“能不能麻烦你把吉他取来，弹一两次那支‘飞吧，飞吧，小鸽子’？当一个人疲惫至极的时候，听听那首歌似乎总会有一种舒适和安慰之感。”","“Sam,” said old man Ellison, stroking his white whiskers with a tremulous hand, “would you mind getting the guitar and playing that ‘Huile, huile, palomita’ piece once or twice?It always seems to be kind of soothing and comforting when a man’s tired and fagged out.”"
"除了故事标题不对之外，我没什么别的话可说了。它应该叫做《最后的男爵》。行吟诗人永远不会消失；而且有时他们叮咚的吉他声似乎会盖过全世界工人镐头和锤子的低沉声。","There is no more to be said, except that the title of the story is wrong.It should have been called “The Last of the Barons.”There never will be an end to the troubadours; and now and then it does seem that the jingle of their guitars will drown the sound of the muffled blows of the pickaxes and trip hammers of all the Workers in the world."
