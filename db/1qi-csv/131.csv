"竞选州长","Running for Governor"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain"
"几个月之前，我获得独立党的提名，同约翰·T. 史密斯先生和布兰克·J. 布兰克先生竞选纽约州州长一职。不知怎的，我觉得比起这两位先生，我有一个非常显著的优势，那就是——好名声。随手翻翻报纸就会很容易知道，倘若这两位先生也知道拥有好名声意味着什么，那也是陈年旧事了。显而易见，近些年来，他们已逐渐对各种无耻罪行习以为常了。但恰恰就在我为自己的优势洋洋得意并暗自窃喜的时刻，在我内心深处却总有一股浑浊的暗流“搅动”着我愉悦的心情——原因是我不得不总听到自己的名字和那些人的名字放在一起相提并论。我变得越来越心神不宁。最后，我给奶奶写了封信，告诉她这件事。她很快回了信，写得一针见血。信中说：","A few months ago I was nominated for Governor of the great state of New York, to run against Mr. John T. Smith and Mr. Blank J. Blank on an independent ticket.I somehow felt that I had one prominent advantage over these gentlemen, and that was—good character.It was easy to see by the newspapers that if ever they had known what it was to bear a good name, that time had gone by.It was plain that in these latter years they had become familiar with all manner of shameful crimes.But at the very moment that I was exalting my advantage and joying in it in secret, there was a muddy undercurrent of discomfort “riling” the deeps of my happiness, and that was—the having to hear my name bandied about in familiar connection with those of such people.I grew more and more disturbed.Finally I wrote my grandmother about it.Her answer came quick and sharp.She said:"
"你这辈子没做过一件让自己感到羞耻的事——一件都没有。你看看报纸——看看他们，想想史密斯先生和布兰克先生都是什么品行，再想想你愿不愿意自降身份和这种人一起参加竞选。","You have never done one single thing in all your life to be ashamed of—not one.Look at the newspapers—look at them and comprehend what sort of characters Messrs. Smith and Blank are, and then see if you are willing to lower yourself to their level and enter a public canvass with them."
"这和我的想法如出一辙！那晚，我一刻都没阖眼。可不管怎么说，我不能退出。","It was my very thought!I did not sleep a single moment that night.But, after all, I could not recede."
"我已经全力以赴，必须继续奋战到底。就在我一边吃早餐，一边漫不经心地翻看报纸时，我看到了下面这段文字。说句实在话，我这辈子还从未如此惊慌失措过。","I was fully committed, and must go on with the fight.As I was looking listlessly over the papers at breakfast I came across this paragraph, and I may truly say I never was so confounded before."
"伪证罪——既然候选人马克·吐温先生正面向公众竞选州长，他或许能屈尊解释一下1863年在交趾支那的瓦卡瓦克，他是如何被34名证人控告伪证罪的。他意图夺取当地一名穷寡妇的香蕉田，这块贫瘠的土地是这个孤苦无依的家庭在丧亲之痛和孤寂凄凉中唯一的经济支柱。不管是为了他自己还是为了那些要给他投票的伟大人民，吐温先生都有必要解释清楚这件事。他愿意这样做吗？","PERJURY.—Perhaps, now that Mr. Mark Twain is before the people as a candidate for Governor, he will condescend to explain how he came to be convicted of perjury by thirty-four witnesses in Wakawak, Cochin China, in 1863, the intent of which perjury being to rob a poor native widow and her helpless family of a meager plantain-patch, their only stay and support in their bereavement and desolation.Mr. Twain owes it to himself, as well as to the great people whose suffrages he asks, to clear this matter up.Will he do it?"
"我真是惊诧不已！竟然有这等残酷无情的指控！我从来没去过交趾支那！我从来没听说过什么瓦卡瓦克！我连香蕉种植地和袋鼠都区分不开！我不知道该怎么办。我既抓狂又无助。那天，我什么事都没干，日子就白白过去了。第二天早晨，这家报纸只有这么一句话：","I thought I should burst with amazement!Such a cruel, heartless charge!I never had seen Cochin China!I never had heard of Wakawak!I didn’t know a plantain-patch from a kangaroo!I did not know what to do.I was crazed and helpless.I let the day slip away without doing anything at all.The next morning the same paper had this—nothing more:"
"意味深长——可以发现，吐温先生对其交趾支那伪证罪一事保持了极具暗示意味的沉默。","SIGNIFICANT.—Mr. Twain, it will be observed, is suggestively silent about the Cochin China perjury."
"［备忘——在此后的竞选中，这家报纸每次提到我，都无一例外地称我为“臭名昭著的伪证犯吐温”。］","[Mem.—During the rest of the campaign this paper never referred to me in any other way than as “the infamous perjurer Twain.”]"
"接着，《公报》上刊登了这样一段文字：","Next came the Gazette, with this:"
"要求知情——新州长候选人能否屈尊向他的某些同胞们（那些为了向他投票而备受煎熬的选民们！）解释一下下面这件小事？吐温先生在蒙大拿州野营时，他的室友总会时不时地丢失一些值钱的小东西。直到最后，这些东西无一例外地从吐温先生身上或他的“箱子”（包着赃物的报纸卷）里被找到。他的室友们认为，为了吐温先生好，他们必须得给他一个友好的告诫。于是，他们在吐温先生身上涂满柏油，粘上羽毛，叫他坐木杠。之后，他们建议吐温先生永远离开他常住的那个铺位，别再回来。他愿意解释吗？","WANTED TO KNOW.—Will the new candidate for Governor deign to explain to certain of his fellow-citizens (who are suffering to vote for him!) the little circumstance of his cabin-mates in Montana losing small valuables from time to time, until at last, these things having been invariably found on Mr. Twain’s person or in his “trunk” (newspaper he rolled his traps in), they felt compelled to give him a friendly admonition for his own good, and so tarred and feathered him, and rode him on a rail; and then advised him to leave a permanent vacuum in the place he usually occupied in the camp.Will he do this?"
"还有比这更别有用心、意图险恶的吗？因为我这辈子都没去过蒙大拿。","Could anything be more deliberately malicious than that?For I never was in Montana in my life."
"［此后，这家报纸常用“吐温，蒙大拿的贼”来称呼我。］","[After this, this journal customarily spoke of me as, “Twain, the Montana Thief.”]"
"从此，我一拿起报纸就忐忑不安——就像某人想拿起一条他渴望得到的毯子，却担心下面有条响尾蛇一样。有一天，我看到这样一段新闻：","I got to picking up papers apprehensively—much as one would lift a desired blanket which he had some idea might have a rattlesnake under it.One day this met my eye:"
"谎言已被揭穿——根据五方位区的迈克尔·奥弗拉纳根先生、沃特街的斯纳布·拉弗蒂先生和卡蒂·马利根先生的宣誓书，现已证实马克·吐温先生恶毒宣称的关于我们尊贵的领袖布兰克·J. 布兰克的祖父——这位值得悼念的先人——是由于在高速公路上实施抢劫而被处以绞刑一说，纯属粗暴无理的谎言，是毫无事实根据的。但凡是有德之士，看到这种通过毁谤死者名声，用谣言玷污他人美誉来取得政治上成功的无耻行径，都无不灰心沮丧。一想到这卑鄙的谎言是如何令逝者的无辜亲友感到极度痛苦时，我们几乎被迫要去煽动受到伤害和侮辱的公众，立即向诽谤者施以非法的报复不可。但我们没有这样做！还是让他受良心的谴责而痛苦吧。（哪怕义愤难平的公众一气之下真的对诽谤者进行人身伤害，也不会有任何陪审团会将此事的凶手定罪，不会有任何法庭会对他们施以惩罚，这是再清楚不过的了。）","THE LIE NAILED.—By the sworn affidavits of Michael O’Flanagan, Esq., of the Five Points, and Mr. Snub Rafferty and Mr. Catty Mulligan, of Water Street, it is established that Mr. Mark Twain’s vile statement that the lamented grandfather of our noble standard-bearer, Blank J. Blank, was hanged for highway robbery, is a brutal and gratuitous LIE, without a shadow of foundation in fact.It is disheartening to virtuous men to see such shameful means resorted to achieve political success as the attacking of the dead in their graves, and defiling their honored names with slander.When we think of the anguish this miserable falsehood must cause the innocent relatives and friends of the deceased, we are almost driven to incite an outraged and insulted public to summon an unlawful vengeance upon the traducer.But no! let us leave him to the agony of a lacerated conscience (though if passion should get the better of the public, and in its blind fury they should do the traducer bodily injury, it is but too obvious that no jury could convict and no court punish the perpetrators of the deed)."
"最后这句妙语起了作用。那晚，“受到伤害和侮辱的公众”从前门涌入时，我吓得赶忙从床上爬起来，从后门溜出去。他们以义愤之名，破坏了我的家具，砸破了我的窗户，走时还一并带走了他们拿得动的财物。然而，我敢手按圣经起誓，我从未中伤过布兰克先生的祖父。更何况，在那天之前，我从未听说过或提到过他。","The ingenious closing sentence had the effect of moving me out of bed with despatch that night, and out at the back door also, while the “outraged and insulted public” surged in the front way, breaking furniture and windows in their righteous indignation as they came, and taking off such property as they could carry when they went.And yet I can lay my hand upon the Book and say that I never slandered Mr. Blank’s grandfather.More: I had never even heard of him or mentioned him up to that day and date."
"［顺便提一下，从此，这家报纸只要提到我，就称我为“吐温，诬尸犯”。］","[I will state, in passing, that the journal above quoted from always referred to me afterward as “Twain, the Body-Snatcher.”]"
"接下来又有一份报纸吸引了我的注意，文章如下：","The next newspaper article that attracted my attention was the following:"
"好一个候选人——马克·吐温先生原定于昨晚在独立党大会上发表一场攻击对方的演讲，他却没有履行义务！他的医生发来电报称其被几匹脱缰的马撞倒了，腿上有两处骨折——他正痛苦地躺在病床上云云，还有很多诸如此类的瞎话。而独立党的人努力使自己听信这套拙劣的托辞，并假装不知道这个他们称之为领袖却放荡不羁的家伙没出席大会的真正原因。有人看到有一个人喝得酩酊大醉，摇摇晃晃地走进了吐温先生下榻的旅馆。独立党有责任、有义务证明这位愚蠢的醉鬼不是马克·吐温本人。我们终于抓到他们的把柄了！此事不容推脱。人民以雷鸣般的声音质问道：“那个人是谁？”","A SWEET CANDIDATE.—Mr. Mark Twain, who was to make such a blighting speech at the mass-meeting of the Independents last night, didn’t come to time!A telegram from his physician stated that he had been knocked down by a runaway team, and his leg broken in two places—sufferer lying in great agony, and so forth, and so forth, and a lot more bosh of the same sort.And the Independents tried hard to swallow the wretched subterfuge, and pretend that they did not know what was the real reason of the absence of the abandoned creature whom they denominate their standard-bearer.A certain man was seen to reel into Mr. Twain’s hotel last night in a state of beastly intoxication.It is the imperative duty of the Independents to prove that this besotted brute was not Mark Twain himself.We have them at last!This is a case that admits of no shirking.The voice of the people demands in thunder tones, “WHO WAS THAT MAN?”"
"看到竟然把我的名字和如此卑鄙的怀疑联系在一起，我感到难以置信，太难以置信了。我已经整整三年没碰过麦芽酒、啤酒、葡萄酒或任何酒精饮料了。","It was incredible, absolutely incredible, for a moment, that it was really my name that was coupled with this disgraceful suspicion.Three long years had passed over my head since I had tasted ale, beer, wine or liquor or any kind."
"[这家报纸在下期就大胆地用“酒疯子吐温先生”来称呼我，尽管我知道这家报纸会忠贞不渝地这样称呼下去，而时间已经在我身上起了作用，我看到自己新的称谓时已经感觉不到痛苦了。]","[It shows what effect the times were having on me when I say that I saw myself, confidently dubbed “Mr. Delirium Tremens Twain” in the next issue of that journal without a pang—notwithstanding I knew that with monotonous fidelity the paper would go on calling me so to the very end.]"
"到了这个时候，匿名信已经成了我信件中的一个重要组成部分。一般都是这样写的：","By this time anonymous letters were getting to be an important part of my mail matter.This form was common:"
"你从房前踢走的那个要饭的老婆婆，现在怎么样了？政客。好打听。","How about that old woman you kiked of your premises which was begging.POL.PRY."
"还有这样写的：","And this:"
"你干的那些事，别人不知道，我可是一清二楚。你最好拿点儿钱来孝敬孝敬鄙人，否则，汉迪·安迪让你报上好看。。","There is things which you Have done which is unbeknowens to anybody but me.You better trot out a few dots, to yours truly, or you’ll hear through the papers from HANDY ANDY."
"差不多都是这个意思。要是愿意，我还可以继续罗列，直到读者厌倦为止。","This is about the idea.I could continue them till the reader was surfeited, if desirable."
"很快，共和党的主要报纸“宣判”我犯有巨额贿赂罪，而民主党的主要报纸则“揭发”我大肆敲诈的恶行。","Shortly the principal Republican journal “convicted” me of wholesale bribery, and the leading Democratic paper “nailed” an aggravated case of blackmailing to me."
"［就这样，我又得到了两个名号：“肮脏的行贿犯吐温”和“恶心的贿赂陪审员者吐温”。］","[In this way I acquired two additional names: “Twain the Filthy Corruptionist” and “Twain the Loathsome Embracer.”]"
"这时候，舆论沸沸扬扬，要求我给各种可怕的指控一个“回应”。我们党的报刊主编和领导们都说，要是再继续保持沉默，我的政治生涯就要完蛋了。仿佛是为了使他们的呼吁显得更加迫切，就在第二天，一家报纸就刊登了如下消息：","By this time there had grown to be such a clamor for an “answer” to all the dreadful charges that were laid to me that the editors and leaders of my party said it would be political ruin for me to remain silent any longer.As if to make their appeal the more imperative, the following appeared in one of the papers the very next day:"
"瞧这个人！——独立党候选人仍然保持着沉默。因为他不敢站出来说话。对他的每项指控都得到了充分的证实，而他意味深长的沉默也反复证实了这一切。时至今日，他这辈子都别想翻案了。看看你们的候选人吧，独立党的人民！看看这个臭名昭著的伪证犯！这个蒙大拿的贼！这个诬尸犯！好好看看你们这个典型的酒疯子！这个肮脏的行贿者！这个恶心的贿赂陪审员的人！盯着他——好好掂量掂量他——再决定你能不能把你们真诚的一票投给这个犯下如此可怕罪行的、给自己惹来一连串坏名声的、连一条罪行都不敢开口否认的家伙！","BEHOLD THE MAN!—The independent candidate still maintains silence.Because he dare not speak.Every accusation against him has been amply proved, and they have been indorsed and reindorsed by his own eloquent silence, till at this day he stands forever convicted.Look upon your candidate, Independents!Look upon the Infamous Perjurer! the Montana Thief! the Body-Snatcher!Contemplate your incarnate Delirium Tremens! your Filthy Corruptionist! your Loathsome Embracer!Gaze upon him—ponder him well—and then say if you can give your honest votes to a creature who has earned this dismal array of titles by his hideous crimes, and dares not open his mouth in denial of any one of them!"
"我走投无路，只得背负上奇耻大辱，开始“回复”那不计其数的毫无根据的指控和卑鄙恶意的谎言。然而，我没能完成这项任务，因为就在第二天早上，一家报纸使我陷入了新的恐慌。它义正严词地指控我烧毁了一座精神病院并烧死了里面所有的精神病人，只因为这座建筑妨碍了我家的视野。这让我陷入惊恐之中。紧接着，又有人指控我为了得到叔父的财产而将其毒死，并急切要求掘坟验尸。这使我濒临崩溃了。除了这些，竟然还有人控告我利用孤儿院管理员之便，雇用老掉牙的无能亲戚为孤儿院做饭。我左右为难——举棋不定。最后，党派争斗对我的无耻迫害终于如期达到了一个再恰当不过的高潮：在一次公众集会上，有九个衣衫褴褛、肤色各异、蹒跚学步的小孩子受到教唆冲向讲台，死死抱紧我的双腿，并喊我“爸”！","There was no possible way of getting out of it, and so, in deep humiliation, I set about preparing to “answer” a mass of baseless charges and mean and wicked falsehoods.But I never finished the task, for the very next morning a paper came out with a new horror, a fresh malignity, and seriously charged me with burning a lunatic asylum with all its inmates, because it obstructed the view from my house.This threw me into a sort of panic.Then came the charge of poisoning my uncle to get his property, with an imperative demand that the grave should be opened.This drove me to the verge of distraction.On top of this I was accused of employing toothless and incompetent old relatives to prepare the food for the foundling’ hospital when I warden.I was wavering—wavering.And at last, as a due and fitting climax to the shameless persecution that party rancor had inflicted upon me, nine little toddling children, of all shades of color and degrees of raggedness, were taught to rush onto the platform at a public meeting, and clasp me around the legs and call me PA!"
"我放弃了州长竞选。我降旗投降。我没达到在纽约州参加州长竞选的要求，所以我递交了退出竞选的声明，并满怀痛苦地签上了我的名字：“您真诚的朋友，曾经品行端正，现在却成了伪证犯、蒙大拿的贼、诬尸犯、酒疯子、行贿犯和贿赂陪审员者的马克·吐温。”","I gave it up.I hauled down my colors and surrendered.I was not equal to the requirements of a Gubernatorial campaign in the state of New York, and so I sent in my withdrawal from the candidacy, and in bitterness of spirit signed it, “Truly yours, once a decent man, but now MARK TWAIN, LP., M.T., B.S., D.T., F.C., and L.E.”"
