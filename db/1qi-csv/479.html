		<td class="en">There was one on a time a great war, and when it came to an end, many soldiers were discharged.Then Brother Lustig also received his dismissal, and besides that, nothing but a small loaf of contract-bread, and four kreuzers in money, with which he departed.St. Peter had, however, placed himself in his way in the shape of a poor beggar, and when Brother Lustig came up, he begged alms of him.Brother Lustig replied, “Dear beggar man, what am I to give you?I have been a soldier, and have received my dismissal, and have nothing but this little loaf of contract-bread, and four kreuzers of money; when that is gone, I shall have to beg as well as you.Still I will give you something.”Thereupon he divided the loaf into four parts, and gave the apostle one of them, and a kreuzer likewise.St. Peter thanked him, went onwards, and threw himself again in the soldier’s way as a beggar, but in another shape; and when he came up begged a gift of him as before.Brother Lustig spoke as he had done before, and again gave him a quarter of the loaf and one kreuzer.St. Peter thanked him, and went onwards, but for the third time placed himself in another shape as a beggar on the road, and spoke to Brother Lustig.Brother Lustig gave him also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer.St. Peter thanked him, and Brother Lustig went onwards, and had but a quarter of the loaf, and one kreuzer.With that he went into an inn, ate the bread, and ordered one kreuzer’s worth of beer.When he had had it, he journeyed onwards, and then St. Peter, who had assumed the appearance of a discharged soldier, met and spoke to him thus: “Good day, comrade, canst thou not give me a bit of bread, and a kreuzer to get a drink?”“Where am I to procure it?” answered Brother Lustig; “I have been discharged, and I got nothing but a loaf of ammunition bread and four kreuzers in money.I met three beggars on the road, and I gave each of them a quarter of my bread, and one kreuzer.The last quarter I ate in the inn, and had a drink with the last kreuzer.Now my pockets are empty, and if thou also hast nothing we can go a-begging together.”“No,” answered St. Peter, “we need not quite do that.I know a little about medicine, and I will soon earn as much as I require by that.”“Indeed,” said Brother Lustig, “I know nothing of that, so I must go and beg alone.”“Just come with me,” said St. Peter, “and if I earn anything, thou shalt have half of it.”“All right,” said Brother Lustig, so they went away together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来他们来到了一处农舍，听到屋里传来很大的哀悼声和痛哭声。于是他们走了进去，原来屋里有个病危的男人，躺着快咽气了，他的太太正放声大哭。圣彼得说：“别哭哭啼啼了，我能让他重新好起来。”他从口袋里掏出一种药膏，很快就治愈了这个病人，他甚至都能够下床，完全健健康康的了。夫妻俩很高兴，说：“我们怎样才能报答你呢？我们要给你些什么呢？”可是圣彼得什么都不要，夫妇俩越是要给，他就越是推辞。然而快乐大哥用肘推了推圣彼得，说：“收一点东西吧，我们也确实很需要啊。”最后农妇拿来一只小羊羔，劝说圣彼得一定要收下，可他还是不要。于是快乐大哥戳了他一下，说：“收下吧，你这个傻子，我们很需要啊！”圣彼得最后说：“好吧，我就收下这只羊羔，但是我不背呀。如果你坚持要收，那你就得背着它了。”快乐大哥说：“那不是问题啊。”“我很容易就背得起它了，”接着就把羊羔扛到了肩膀上。然后他们就出发了，来到了一片树林里，快乐大哥开始感到羊羔有些重了，并且他也饿了，于是对圣彼得说：“看，这是一个不错的地方啊，我们就在这儿把羊羔煮煮吃了吧。”圣彼得回答道：“你想煮就煮吧，但是我不会啊。你要是煮的话，这里有个锅给你，煮好之前的这会儿功夫我就去周围转转吧。但是必须记住，直到我回来了你才能开始吃羊肉，我会适时回来的。”快乐大哥说：“好的，那你走吧，我懂烹调的，我能应付得好。”于是圣彼得离开了，快乐大哥宰了小羊羔，生起火来，将肉扔进锅里，把肉煮沸。可羊肉都完全煮熟了，圣彼得还是没有回来，于是快乐大哥从锅里捞出肉来切开了，看到了羊心。他说：“这据说是最好吃的部分了，”并尝了尝，但最后他把整个羊心都吃掉了。圣彼得终于回来了，他说：“你可以把整只羊都吃了，我只要那个羊心，给我吧。”于是快乐大哥拿起刀叉，假装很急切地在羊肉里寻找，但是没能找到，后来他忽然说：“没有羊心。”圣彼得说：“可它能在哪儿呢？”快乐大哥答道：“我不知道，不过你看，我们俩真是傻瓜呀，竟要找羊心，我们都不记得了，小羊羔是没有心的！”圣彼得说：“噢，这真是新奇！每个动物都长着心，为什么小羊羔就没长呢？”快乐大哥说：“没长，确实没长，兄弟，小羊羔是没有心的。认真想一想，你会想起来的，它的确没长心。”圣彼得说：“那好吧，如果没有羊心，我就不想吃什么了，你自己吃吧。”快乐大哥说：“我现在吃不完的，就放到背包里带走。”他吃了半只羊羔，把剩下的放到了背包里。</td>
		<td class="en">Then they came to a peasant’s house inside which they heard loud lamentations and cries; so they went in, and there the husband was lying sick unto death, and very near his end, and his wife was crying and weeping quite loudly.“Stop that howling and crying,” said St. Peter, “I will make the man well again,” and he took a salve out of his pocket, and healed the sick man in a moment, so that he could get up, and was in perfect health.In great delight the man and his wife said, “How can we reward you?What shall we give you?”But St. Peter would take nothing, and the more the peasant folks offered him, the more he refused.Brother Lustig, however, nudged St. Peter, and said, “Take something; sure enough we are in need of it.”At length the woman brought a lamb and said to St. Peter that he really must take that, but he would not.Then Brother Lustig gave him a poke in the side, and said, “Do take it, you stupid fool; we are in great want of it!”Then St. Peter said at last, “Well, I will take the lamb, but I won’t carry it; if thou wilt insist on having it, thou must carry it.”“That is nothing,” said Brother Lustig.“I will easily carry it,” and took it on his shoulder.Then they departed and came to a wood, but Brother Lustig had begun to feel the lamb heavy, and he was hungry, so he said to St. Peter, “Look, that’s a good place, we might cook the lamb there, and eat it.”“As you like,” answered St. Peter, “but I can’t have anything to do with the cooking; if thou wilt cook, there is a kettle for thee, and in the meantime I will walk about a little until it is ready.Thou must, however, not begin to eat until I have come back, I will come at the right time.”“Well, go, then,” said Brother Lustig, “I understand cookery, I will manage it.”Then St. Peter went away, and Brother Lustig killed the lamb, lighted a fire, threw the meat into the kettle, and boiled it.The lamb was, however, quite ready, and the apostle Peter had not come back, so Brother Lustig took it out of the kettle, cut it up, and found the heart.“That is said to be the best part,” said he, and tasted it, but at last he ate it all up.At length St. Peter returned and said, “Thou mayst eat the whole of the lamb thyself, I will only have the heart, give me that.”Then Brother Lustig took a knife and fork, and pretended to look anxiously about amongst the lamb’s flesh, but not to be able to find the heart, and at last he said abruptly, “There is none here.”“But where can it be?” said the apostle.“I don’t know,” replied Brother Lustig, “but look, what fools we both are, to seek for the lamb’s heart, and neither of us to remember that a lamb has no heart!”“Oh,” said St. Peter, “that is something quite new!Every animal has a heart, why is a lamb to have none?”“No, be assured, my brother,” said Brother Lustig, “that a lamb has no heart; just consider it seriously, and then you will see that it really has none.”“Well, it is all right,” said St. Peter, “if there is no heart, then I want none of the lamb; thou mayst eat it alone.”“What I can’t eat now, I will carry away in my knapsack,” said Brother Lustig, and he ate half the lamb, and put the rest in his knapsack.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们继续赶路，这时圣彼得变出了一条大大的河来，河水流淌着，正好挡住了他们的去路，他们被迫要蹚水过去。圣彼得说：“你先走吧。”快乐大哥答道：“我不，你得先走。”他想：“要是水太深了，我就留在后面不过了。”于是圣彼得大步蹚着水过去了，水只到了他的膝盖处。快乐大哥因此也开始过河，可河水越来越深，都涨到他的咽喉处了。他喊道：“兄弟，救救我啊！”圣彼得说：“那你会承认是你吃了羊心吗？”他说：“不，我没吃。”于是河水又涨高了，高到他的嘴巴处。快乐大哥又喊：“救救我，兄弟。”圣彼得说：“那你承认你吃了羊心吗？”他答道：“不，我没吃。”圣彼得无论如何是不会让他淹死的，于是把水退去，帮他渡过了河。</td>
		<td class="en">They went farther, and then St. Peter caused a great stream of water to flow right across their path, and they were obliged to pass through it.Said St. Peter, “Do thou go first.”“No,” answered Brother Lustig, “thou must go first,” and he thought, “if the water is too deep I will stay behind.”Then St. Peter strode through it, and the water just reached to his knee.So Brother Lustig began to go through also, but the water grew deeper and reached to his throat.Then he cried, “Brother, help me!”St. Peter said, “Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb’s heart?”“No,” said he, “I have not eaten it.”Then the water grew deeper still and rose to his mouth.“Help me, brother,” cried the soldier.St. Peter said, “Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb’s heart?”“No,” he replied, “I have not eaten it.”St. Peter, however, would not let him be drowned, but made the water sink and helped him through it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们继续赶路，来到了一个国家，他们听说国王的女儿病重，快要咽气了。快乐大哥便对圣彼得说：“嗨，兄弟！这对我们来说可是一次机会啊。如果我们能治好她的病，那一辈子都会有人供养我们了呀！”但是对他而言，圣彼得走得特别慢，快乐大哥说：“好兄弟，快点，快些，那样我们才可能及时赶到啊。”尽管快乐大哥尽可能地又催他又推他，可圣彼得却越走越慢了，最后他们听说公主已经死掉了。快乐大哥说道：“现在我们完了！都怪你走得那么慢！”圣彼得答道：“安静点吧，我不仅仅能治愈病人；我还能让死人起死回生。”快乐大哥说：“好吧，如果你能做到，那还行，你这次至少得为我们赢回半个王国。”于是他们走进了王宫，王宫里的每个人都沉浸在巨大的悲痛中，圣彼得告诉国王他能让公主起死回生。于是他被带到了公主身边，他说：“给我拿一口锅和一些水来。”这些东西准备好后，他命令所有人都离开，除了快乐大哥之外不允许任何人在他旁边。然后他截下了公主的四肢，把它们扔到了水里，在锅下面生起火，煮了起来。在肉从骨头上脱落下来后，他便取出了这些漂亮的白骨放在桌上，然后把它们按原本的顺序排列到了一起。完成这些后，他走上前去，说了三遍：“以圣父圣子圣灵的名义，死去的人啊，站起来吧。”到第三遍的时候，公主真的站了起来，活生生的，既健康又漂亮。国王非常高兴，便对圣彼得说：“你想要什么报酬。即使是要我的半个王国，我也会给你的。”但是圣彼得却说：“我什么也不要。”快乐大哥暗自想：“噢，你这个笨蛋！”他捅了捅圣彼得，说：“别犯傻了！即使你什么都不需要了，我还需要呢。”圣彼得无论如何什么也不要，可是国王看出来了，另一个人是很想收点什么的，于是他命令财务大臣把快乐大哥的背包里装满了金子。然后他们继续赶路了，走到一处森林的时候，圣彼得对快乐大哥说：“现在，我们把金子分一分吧。”他答道：“好的，我们分一分吧。”于是圣彼得分起金子来，他把金子分成了三堆。快乐大哥暗自想：“他现在脑子里想什么疯事呢？他分成了三堆，可我们就两个人啊！”圣彼得说：“我已经准确地分好了，我一堆，你一堆，吃羊心的那个人也有一堆。”</td>
		<td class="en">Then they journeyed onwards, and came to a kingdom where they heard that the King’s daughter lay sick unto death.“Hollo, brother!” said the soldier to St. Peter, “this is a chance for us; if we can heal her we shall be provided for, for life!”But St. Peter was not half quick enough for him, “Come, lift your legs, my dear brother,” said he, “that we may get there in time.”But St. Peter walked slower and slower, though Brother Lustig did all he could to drive and push him on, and at last they heard that the princess was dead.“Now we are done for!” said Brother Lustig; “that comes of thy sleepy way of walking!”“Just be quiet,” answered St. Peter, “I can do more than cure sick people; I can bring dead ones to life again.”“Well, if thou canst do that,” said Brother Lustig, “it’s all right, but thou shouldst earn at least half the kingdom for us by that.”Then they went to the royal palace, where every one was in great grief, but St. Peter told the King that he would restore his daughter to life.He was taken to her, and said, “Bring me a kettle and some water,” and when that was brought, he bade everyone go out, and allowed no one to remain with him but Brother Lustig.Then he cut off all the dead girl’s limbs, and threw them in the water, lighted a fire beneath the kettle, and boiled them.And when the flesh had fallen away from the bones, he took out the beautiful white bones, and laid them on a table, and arranged them together in their natural order.When he had done that, he stepped forward and said three times, “In the name of the holy Trinity, dead woman, arise.”And at the third time, the princess arose, living, healthy and beautiful.Then the King was in the greatest joy, and said to St. Peter, “Ask for thy reward; even if it were half my kingdom, I would give it thee.”But St. Peter said, “I want nothing for it.”“Oh, thou tomfool!” thought Brother Lustig to himself, and nudged his comrade’s side, and said, “Don’t be so stupid!If thou hast no need of anything, I have.”St. Peter, however, would have nothing, but as the King saw that the other would very much like to have something, he ordered his treasurer to fill Brother Lustig’s knapsack with gold.Then they went on their way, and when they came to a forest, St. Peter said to Brother Lustig, “Now, we will divide the gold.”“Yes,” he replied, “we will.”So St. Peter divided the gold, and divided it into three heaps.Brother Lustig thought to himself, “What craze has he got in his head now?He is making three shares, and there are only two of us!”But St. Peter said, “I have divided it exactly; there is one share for me, one for thee, and one for him who ate the lamb’s heart.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >快乐大哥马上说：“噢，我吃了羊心！”然后迅速地把金子收了过去。他又说：“你要相信我说的话。”圣彼得说：“要是羊羔不长心的话，这怎么可能是真的呢？”“嗯，什么啊，兄弟，你在想些什么啊？羊羔像其他动物一样都长着心的，凭什么只有它们不长心呢？”圣彼得说：“好吧，但愿如此。你自己留着金子吧，但是我不会再和你同行了，我要自己走了。”快乐大哥答道：“随便你，好兄弟。再会了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I ate that!” replied Brother Lustig, and hastily swept up the gold.“You may trust what I say.”“But how can that be true,” said St. Peter, “when a lamb has no heart?”“Eh, what, brother, what can you be thinking of?Lambs have hearts like other animals, why should only they have none?”“Well, so be it,” said St. Peter, “keep the gold to yourself, but I will stay with you no longer; I will go my way alone.”“As you like, dear brother,” answered Brother Lustig.Farewell.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是圣彼得踏上了另一段路途，快乐大哥想：“他自己走开了倒不错，他的确是一个奇怪的人啊。”他有了足够的钱，却不知道如何打理这些钱，他挥霍无度，随意送人，随着时间流逝，他再次一无所有了。后来他走到一个国家，听说国王的女儿去世了。他想：“噢，嗬！这对我来说也许是件好事呢。我会让她起死回生，会得到我应得的报酬啊。”于是他去见国王，主动说能让公主起死回生。国王已听说过，有个四处周游的退伍士兵能让人起死回生，他以为快乐大哥就是那个人。但是由于他对快乐大哥并没有信心，便事先同谋士们商量了一下，他们说既然公主已经死了，倒不妨让他试一试。于是快乐大哥命人端来一口盛着水的锅，又命令所有人出去，他仿照圣彼得的做法，截下了公主的四肢，扔到水里，在下面生起一堆火来。水烧开了，肉脱落下来，他便取出骨头放到桌上，可他不知道如何排列骨头的顺序，都排错了，错得一塌糊涂。然后他站在骨头前，说道：“以圣父圣子圣灵的名义，死去的人啊，我命令你站起来。”他说了三遍，可骨头仍一动不动。于是他又说了三遍，可依旧徒劳，他喊道：“你这讨厌的姑娘，站起来！站起来，不然你会更倒霉的！”当他这么说的时候，圣彼得忽然以先前退伍士兵的模样出现了。他从窗户穿进来，说：“你这个无法无天的家伙，你在干什么啊？你把她的骨头排扔得这么乱，怎能让她复活啊？”他答道：“好兄弟，我已经尽我最大的努力了。”“这次我会帮你摆脱困境，但是我要跟你讲明一点，如果你还要做这类事情，那你就会倒霉的，你也不能因为此事向国王索要或者接受任何报酬！”随即圣彼得把骨头按正确顺序排列好，对公主说了三遍：“以圣父圣子圣灵的名义，死去的人啊，站起来吧。”公主便站了起来，像以前一样健康漂亮。圣彼得又从窗户穿了出去，快乐大哥看到一切都进行得这么顺利很是高兴，但是想到竟不能为此得到任何报酬，又很是烦恼。他想：“我倒想知道这个家伙脑袋里想的是什么，因为他一只手给你的东西，又会用另一手拿回去，真是毫无道理！”国王要给快乐大哥任何他想要的东西，他却什么也不敢要.可是，他设法通过暗示和诡计使得国王下令把他的背包里装满了金子，他带着那些金子上路了。当他走出去的时候，圣彼得正站在门旁，说道：“看看你是个什么样的人，我没告诉你什么都不能收吗，你却装了满背包的金子！”快乐大哥答道：“人们非要给我装上，我能怎么办？”“好吧，我告诉你，如果你再干这种事情，你就会为此付出代价的！”“啊，兄弟，别担心了，我现在已经有钱了，我干嘛还给自己找麻烦去洗骨头啊？”圣彼得说：“是的，这些金子够花一长段时间了！为了你以后再不会去做那些禁止的事情，我要赐予你的背包一种魔力，也就是，你想要里面有什么，那就会有什么。再见了，你以后不会再看到我了。”快乐大哥说：“再见。”他暗自想：“你走了我倒高兴呢，你真是个怪人，我当然不会跟着你了。”但是，对他背包被赋予的那种魔力，他并未多想。</td>
		<td class="en">Then St. Peter went a different road, but Brother Lustig thought, “It is a good thing that he has taken himself off, he is certainly a strange saint, after all.”Then he had money enough, but did not know how to manage it, squandered it, gave it away, and and when some time had gone by, once more had nothing.Then he arrived in a certain country where he heard that a King’s daughter was dead.“Oh, ho!” thought he, “that may be a good thing for me; I will bring her to life again, and see that I am paid as I ought to be.”So he went to the King, and offered to raise the dead girl to life again.Now the King had heard that a discharged soldier was traveling about and bringing dead persons to life again, and thought that Brother Lustig was the man; but as he had no confidence in him, he consulted his councillors first, who said that he might give it a trial as his daughter was dead.Then Brother Lustig ordered water to be brought to him in a kettle, bade every one go out, cut the limbs off, threw them in the water and lighted a fire beneath, just as he had seen St. Peter do.The water began to boil, the flesh fell off, and then he took the bones out and laid them on the table, but he did not know the order in which to lay them, and placed them all wrong and in confusion.Then he stood before them and said, “In the name of the most holy Trinity, dead maiden, I bid thee arise,” and he said this thrice, but the bones did not stir.So he said it thrice more, but also in vain: “Confounded girl that you are, get up!” cried he, “Get up, or it shall be worse for you!”When he had said that, St. Peter suddenly appeared in his former shape as a discharged soldier; he entered by the window and said, “Godless man, what art thou doing?How can the dead maiden arise, when thou hast thrown about her bones in such confusion?”“Dear brother, I have done everything to the best of my ability,” he answered.“This once, I will help thee out of thy difficulty, but one thing I tell thee, and that is that if ever thou undertakest anything of the kind again, it will be the worse for thee, and also that thou must neither demand nor accept the smallest thing from the King for this!”Thereupon St. Peter laid the bones in their right order, said to the maiden three times, “In the name of the most holy Trinity, dead maiden, arise,” and the King’s daughter arose, healthy and beautiful as before.Then St. Peter went away again by the window, and Brother Lustig was rejoiced to find that all had passed off so well, but was very much vexed to think that after all he was not to take anything for it.“I should just like to know,” thought he, “what fancy that fellow has got in his head, for what he gives with one hand he takes away with the other, there is no sense whatever in it!”Then the King offered Brother Lustig whatsoever he wished to have, but he did not dare to take anything; however, by hints and cunning, he contrived to make the King order his knapsack to be filled with gold for him, and with that he departed.When he got out, St. Peter was standing by the door, and said, “Just look what a man thou art; did I not forbid thee to take anything, and there thou hast thy knapsack full of gold!”“How can I help that,” answered Brother Lustig, “if people will put it in for me?”“Well, I tell thee this, that if ever thou settest about anything of this kind again thou shalt suffer for it!”“Eh, brother, have no fear, now I have money, why should I trouble myself with washing bones?”“Faith,” said St. Peter, “the gold will last a long time!In order that after this thou mayst never tread in forbidden paths, I will bestow on thy knapsack this property, namely, that whatsoever thou wishest to have inside it, shall be there.Farewell, thou wilt now never see me more.”“Goodbye,” said Brother Lustig, and thought to himself, “I am very glad that thou hast taken thyself off, thou strange fellow; I shall certainly not follow thee.”But of the magical power which had been bestowed on his knapsack, he thought no more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >快乐大哥带着他的那些钱财四处周游，像以前一样挥霍浪费。最后他只剩下四个铜板了，经过一家小酒馆的时候，他想：“这些钱也得花掉的。”于是要了三个铜板的酒，还有一个铜板的面包。他正坐在那里喝酒的时候，烤鹅肉的香味儿传到了鼻子里。快乐大哥四处张望了一下，看到店主的烤炉里杵着两只鹅呢。这时他记起圣彼得说过，他想要背包里有什么，那就会有什么，于是他说：“噢，嗬！我一定要拿这鹅来试一试。”</td>
		<td class="en">Brother Lustig travelled about with his money, and squandered and wasted what he had as before.When at last he had no more than four kreuzers, he passed by an inn and thought, “The money must go,” and ordered three kreuzers’ worth of wine and one kreuzer’s worth of bread for himself.As he was sitting there drinking, the smell of roast goose made its way to his nose.Brother Lustig looked about and peeped, and saw that the host had two geese standing in the oven.Then he remembered that his comrade had said that whatsoever he wished to have in his knapsack should be there, so he said, “Oh, ho! I must try that with the geese。”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那女人就这样跟强盗一起呆了很多年，汉斯已经长成了高大健壮的男子汉。母亲经常给他讲故事，还教他念一本从山洞中找到关于骑士的旧故事书。汉斯长到九岁时，用杉树枝给自己削了一根粗大的木棍，藏在床背后，然后他去问母亲：“亲爱的母亲，告诉我，我的父亲是谁，我一定要知道！”母亲沉默了，她不能告诉他，让他有回家的念头，而且，那些无法无天的强盗根本不可能放他走的。但一想到汉斯见不到自己的亲身父亲，母亲就心如刀割。晚上，等强盗们劫财归来，汉斯紧握他的大木棍，来到强盗头子面前，说：“我要知道我的父亲是谁！你现在要不说的话，我就一棍子打死你！”强盗头子大笑，照着耳根狠狠地打了汉斯一拳，把汉斯打得滚到了桌子下面。汉斯站起身来，一声不吭，心想：“再等一年，我还要试试！我会比现在强的！”很快一年就过去了，汉斯重新拿出那根棍子，擦掉上面的灰尘，凝视了一会，自言自语道：“这是一根多么结实的棍子啊！”晚上，强盗们都回来了，抱着酒坛一罐接一罐地狂饮，一个个都醉得头晕目眩的。汉斯手握木棍，又来到强盗头子面前，问他自己的父亲是谁。强盗头子又重重地给了汉斯耳根一拳，把他打到桌下。不过不久，汉斯就站起身来，用大棍狠狠地揍头子和强盗们，把他们打得无法动弹。母亲站在墙角，对儿子的勇敢和坚强充满了敬佩。汉斯把强盗教训了一顿后，对母亲说：“我说过我不是闹着玩的！现在我得知道我的父亲是谁了！”“我亲爱的孩子，”母亲说，“我们快点走吧！我们现在就出发去找他，一定可以找到他！”母亲从强盗头子身上搜出大门的钥匙；汉斯拿来一个大袋子，往袋子里装满了金银珠宝，还有其他美丽的玩意。然后他背着袋子上路了。他们终于走出了山洞，从黑漆漆的山洞来到阳光下，汉斯看到的是多么美丽的景象啊：郁郁葱葱的森林、五颜六色的花儿、叽叽喳喳的小鸟，还有天空中的朝阳！他站住了，痴痴地陶醉在这一片美景之中。母亲回想着回家的路，经过几个钟头的长途跋涉，他们终于回到了那个人迹罕至的小山谷，回到了他们的小屋子。当时他的父亲就坐在门口。父亲认出自己失踪多年的妻子，又得知汉斯就是自己的儿子，他高兴得热泪直流，因为他本以为他们早已不在人世了呢！虽然还未满十二岁，汉斯已经整整比父亲高出一头了。他们一起进入小屋，汉斯刚将沉甸甸的袋子放在炉边的凳子上，那整个屋子就开始瓦解。先是凳子断裂开来，然后地板也裂开缝，那沉甸甸的袋子就一直掉进了地窖里。“我的天啊！”父亲大叫道，“这是怎么了？你把我们的房子弄塌了吗？”“亲爱的父亲，别为这个担心！”汉斯安慰道，“那个袋子里装的钱远远够你盖一座新房子了！”于是父亲和汉斯马上着手建造新房，还买了牛和田地，有了自己的农庄。汉斯去田里耕地的时候，走在牛后头，用力将犁推进深土，这样牛拉起犁来几乎不要用力。第二年春天，汉斯对父亲说：“剩下的钱你慢慢花吧！麻烦请人帮我造一根重一点的手杖，我想出去走走了。”汉斯想要的手杖做好后，他就离开了父亲的房子。他走呀走，就来到一片茂密的黑森林。突然他听见吱吱嘎嘎破裂的响声。他四处一望，才看见是一棵杉树，从树梢到树根被扭成了麻绳一般。再往上看，只见一个大个子正拎着树干，像扭柳树枝一样轻松地盘弄着。“喂！”汉斯对他喊道，“你在上面干什么呢？”那个人回答道，“我昨天砍了一堆柴，今天来搓根麻绳好把它们捆起来。”“嘿，我喜欢这个家伙！”汉斯心想，“他倒有些力气。”于是他对那人喊道：“别忙活了，跟我一起走吧！”大个子就跳了下来，竟然比高大的汉斯还高出整整一个头！“就叫你‘扭树人’吧！”汉斯对他说。于是他们一起结伴向前走，猛然间听到铁锤重重敲击的声响，每敲一下，大地都跟着震动。很快，他们来到一块巨大的岩石旁，一个巨人正站在那里用拳头一下一下地打着岩石，打得石头一块块纷纷坠下。汉斯问他在做什么，巨人回答道：“我晚上睡觉的时候，那些狼啊熊啊什么的野兽都围着我身边闻来闻去，简直不让我睡个好觉！所以我就想造个房子，睡在里面，那样就能安稳些了。”“哦，是啊！”汉斯心想，“这个家伙也能为我所用。”于是汉斯对他说：“别管你的房子了，跟我们一起走吧！就叫你‘碎石人’好了。”巨人同意了，于是他们三人就一起在森林里闲逛，所过之处，野兽都吓得四散逃窜。晚上，他们来到一座废弃已久的老城堡，躺在大厅里歇息。第二天一早，汉斯走进了花园里。花园里杂草丛生，荆棘密布。汉斯正在花园里到处走着，突然一头野猪径直冲向汉斯，但汉斯一棍子打过去，野猪就应声倒地了。汉斯扛着野猪回到城堡，他们就生火将野猪烤熟了，饱餐了一顿。从那之后，他们就安排每天轮着由两个人出去找吃的，一个人呆家里给大家做饭，他们一个人一天能吃九磅肉呢！第一天，“扭树人”呆家里，汉斯和“碎石人”出去打猎。正当“扭树人”忙着做饭的时候，一个皱皱巴巴的小老头走进城堡来，问他要点肉吃。“滚远点，狡猾的骗子！”他答道，“你根本用不着吃肉。”但是，让“扭树人”怎么都想不到的是，这个不起眼的小矮子竟然向他猛扑过来，挥拳痛打了他一顿，而他根本无法招架，只有倒在地上喘气的份儿！小矮子把心里受的气发泄完了，才愤然离去。等那两个打猎的人回家之后，“扭树人”对今天发生的被小矮子痛打的丢人事只字未提，他想：“等轮到他们在家做饭，遇到那个野蛮的小个子，也让他们尝尝苦头！”这样的想法让他开心起来。</td>
		<td class="en">The woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew tall and strong.His mother told him stories, and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave.When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then went to his mother and said, “Dear mother, pray tell me who is my father; I must and will know.”His mother was silent and would not tell him, that he might not become home-sick; moreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but it almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father.In the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain, and said, “I now wish to know who is my father, and if thou dost not at once tell me I will strike thee down.”Then the captain laughed, and gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table.Hans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, “I will wait another year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then.”When the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the dust off it, looked at it well, and said, “It is a stout strong club.”At night the robbers came home, drank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be heavy.Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before the captain, and asked him who was his father?But the captain again gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled under the table, but it was not long before he was up again, and beat the captain and the robbers so with his club, that they could no longer move either their arms or their legs.His mother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and strength.When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother, and said, “Now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I must also know who is my father.”“Dear Hans,” answered the mother, “come, we will go and seek him until we find him.”She took from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans fetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was full, and then he took it on his back.They left the cave, but how Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and the birds, and the morning sun in the sky.He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise.His mother looked for the way home, and when they had walked for a couple of hours, they got safely into their lonely valley and to their little house.The father was sitting in the doorway.He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that Hans was his son, for he had long regarded them both as dead.But Hans, although he was not twelve years old, was a head taller than his father.They went into the little room together, but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove, than the whole house began to crack the bench broke down and then the floor, and the heavy sack fell through into the cellar.“God save us!” cried the father, “what’s that?Now thou hast broken our little house to pieces!”“Don’t grow any grey hairs about that, dear father,” answered Hans; “there, in that sack, is more than is wanting for a new house.”The father and Hans at once began to build a new house; to buy cattle and land, and to keep a farm.Hans ploughed the fields, and when he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground, the bullocks had scarcely any need to draw.The next spring, Hans said, “Keep all the money and get a walking-stick that weighs a hundred-weight made for me that I may go a—travelling.”When the wished-for stick was ready, he left his father’s house, went forth, and came to a deep, dark forest.There he heard something crunching and cracking, looked round, and saw a fir-tree which was wound round like a rope from the bottom to the top, and when he looked upwards he saw a great fellow who had laid hold of the tree and was twisting it like a willow-wand.“Hollo!” cried Hans, “what art thou doing up there?” the fellow replied, “I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting a rope for them.”“That is what I like,” thought Hans, “he has some strength,” and he called to him, “Leave that alone, and come with me.”The fellow came down, and he was taller by a whole head than Hans, and Hans was not little.“Thy name is now Fir-twister,” said Hans to him.Thereupon they went further and heard something knocking and hammering with such force that the ground shook at every stroke.Shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock, before which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of it away with his fist.When Hans asked what he was about, he answered, “At night, when I want to sleep, bears, wolves, and other vermin of that kind come, which sniff and snuffle about me and won’t let me rest; so I want to build myself a house and lay myself inside it, so that I may have some peace.”“Oh, indeed,” thought Hans, “I can make use of this one also;” and said to him, “Leave thy house-building alone, and go with me; thou shalt be called Rock—splitter.”The man consented, and they all three roamed through the forest, and wherever they went the wild beasts were terrified, and ran away from them.In the evening they came to an old deserted castle, went up into it, and laid themselves down in the hall to sleep.The next morning Hans went into the garden.It had run quite wild, and was full of thorns and bushes.And as he was thus walking round about, a wild boar rushed at him; he, however, gave it such a blow with his club that it fell directly.He took it on his shoulders and carried it in, and they put it on a spit, roasted it, and enjoyed themselves.Then they arranged that each day, in turn, two should go out hunting, and one should stay at home, and cook nine pounds of meat for each of them.Fir-twister stayed at home the first, and Hans and Rock-splitter went out hunting.When Fir-twister was busy cooking, a little shrivelled-up old mannikin came to him in the castle, and asked for some meat.“Be off, sly hypocrite,” he answered, “thou needest no meat.”But how astonished Fir-twister was when the little insignificant dwarf sprang up at him, and belaboured him so with his fists that he could not defend himself, but fell on the ground and gasped for breath!The dwarf did not go away until he had thoroughly vented his anger on him.When the two others came home from hunting, Fir-twister said nothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows which he himself had received, and thought, “When they stay at home, they may just try their chance with the little scrubbing-brush;” and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The next day Rock-splitter stayed at home, and he fared just as Fir-twister had done, he was very ill-treated by the dwarf because he was not willing to give him any meat.When the others came home in the evening, Fir-twister easily saw what he had suffered, but both kept silence, and thought, “Hans also must taste some of that soup.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第三天是汉斯留在家里。当他在厨房忙着做饭、擦洗碗盆，小矮子又来了，开口就要吃肉。汉斯心想：“看他真是个可怜人呢！我就把我的那份分点给他吃吧，也不影响那两个家伙的。”于是汉斯就分了一点肉给他。小矮子狼吞虎咽地吃完那份之后，还问汉斯要肉吃，好心的汉斯又给了他一块，并说这是很大的一块，应该够他吃了。哪知小矮子吃完这块肉，又向汉斯要。“你可真是贪得无厌！”汉斯这次拒绝了。恶狠狠的小矮子打算向他猛扑过去，就像以前教训扭树人和碎石人一样教训汉斯，可是这次他是找错对象了。汉斯轻轻松松几个拳头迎过去，就打得小矮子跳下了城堡的台阶。汉斯本打算一路追过去，但由于身材高大，反被小矮子绊了一跤。等汉斯站起来，小矮子已经跑远了。汉斯紧追不舍，一直追到森林里，眼见他钻进了石头上的一个洞里。汉斯只能回家了，不过他在这里做了标记。等那两个家伙回到家里，看见汉斯竟然泰然无事，都大为吃惊。汉斯把今天发生的事跟他们讲了，那两个家伙也不再隐瞒自己经历了什么。汉斯大笑，说：“你们真是该打！怎么那么小气呢？一点肉都舍不得施舍！也真丢脸了，长这么高大威猛，还被那个小矮人给收拾了！”于是，他们带上篮子和绳子，一起来到了小矮人溜进去的地洞。他们让汉斯带着他的棍子坐进篮子里，用绳子将篮子放下洞里去。当汉斯到了岩洞底，发现了一扇门。他打开门，竟然看到一位美如天仙，不，应该是美得无法描述的姑娘坐在那里。而那个小矮人正坐在她身边，像海猫一样阴险地盯着汉斯诡笑。姑娘的身子被铁链绑着，悲伤地看着汉斯，汉斯顿生怜惜之心，心想：“今天非把这个可怜的姑娘从这个邪恶的小矮子手里救出来不可！”于是汉斯一棍子向小矮人猛击过去，小矮人一下就倒地而亡了。姑娘身上的铁链也立刻解开了，而汉斯早被她的美迷住了！姑娘说她本是个国王的女儿，被一个野蛮的伯爵偷抢过来，因为她拒不搭理伯爵，就被囚禁在这个岩洞里。伯爵派了这个小矮人看守她，让她受尽了痛苦。汉斯将姑娘放进篮子，让两个同伴把她拉了上去。等篮子再次放下来的时候，汉斯却对两个家伙起了疑心，他想：“他们上次就已经欺骗了我，隐瞒了有关小矮人的事，天知道这次他们会怎么对付我？”汉斯就把棍子放进了篮子里，叫他们拉上去。多亏汉斯长了个心眼，篮子拉到半路，果然被摔下来了。如果汉斯自己坐里面的话，肯定没命了。只是汉斯现在也不知道该怎么从这么深的地方上去，他思来想去，一筹莫展。“那真是悲伤，”汉斯心想，“如果我只能在这里等死的话。”他在岩洞里没头绪地走来走去，偶然又回到了当时姑娘所在的房间，他看到小矮人手指上戴着一枚闪亮的戒指。汉斯取下戒指，套在自己手指上，他转动着手上的戒指，突然听到头顶传来沙沙的声响。他抬头一看，竟然是几个精灵围着他翩然盘旋着，它们说他是她们的主人，问他有什么愿望。汉斯一时惊讶得说不出话来，等回过神来，他要她们马上带他出洞去。她们立刻遵命，汉斯恍然感觉自己飞起来了。然而，当汉斯回到地面上的时候，那两个家伙早没了人影。“扭树人”和“碎石人”都已经逃之夭夭，还带走了美丽的姑娘。但汉斯转动了戒指，精灵又出现了，并告诉他那两个家伙在大海上。汉斯一刻不停地拼命追赶，终于到了海边，只看见远远的天边，浮有一叶小舟，里面就坐着他那两个背信弃义的同伴。汉斯怒火冲天，想也没想就提着棍子跳入海中，准备游过去收拾他们，但手中的棍子实在太沉了，拖着他直向海底沉去，差点儿淹死他。在这紧要关头，汉斯转动神戒，精灵立刻出现将他救起，并风驰电掣般地把他带到那两个家伙的船边。汉斯挥舞手中的大棍，给了那两个邪恶的家伙他们应有的教训，然后把他们扔下了大海。那个美丽的姑娘被吓坏了，汉斯再一次拯救了她，坐着船将她送回家，并见到了她的父母。后来他们结婚了，生活得非常幸福美满。</td>
		<td class="en">Hans, who had to stay at home the next day, did his work in the kitchen as it had to be done, and as he was standing skimming the pan, the dwarf came and without more ado demanded a bit of meat.Then Hans thought, “He is a poor wretch, I will give him some of my share, that the others may not run short,” and handed him a bit.When the dwarf had devoured it, he again asked for some meat, and good-natured Hans gave it to him, and told him it was a handsome piece, and that he was to be content with it.But the dwarf begged again for the third time.“Thou art shameless!” said Hans, and gave him none.Then the malicious dwarf wanted to spring on him and treat him as he had treated Fir—twister and Rock-splitter, but he had got to the wrong man.Hans, without exerting himself much, gave him a couple of blows which made him jump down the castle steps.Hans was about to run after him, but fell right over him, for he was so tall.When he rose up again, the dwarf had got the start of him.Hans hurried after him as far as the forest, and saw him slip into a hole in the rock.Hans now went home, but he had marked the spot.When the two others came back, they were surprised that Hans was so well.He told them what had happened, and then they no longer concealed how it had fared with them.Hans laughed and said, “It served you quite right; why were you so greedy with your meat?It is a disgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be beaten by the dwarf.”Thereupon they took a basket and a rope, and all three went to the hole in the rock into which the dwarf had slipped, and let Hans and his club down in the basket.When Hans had reached the bottom, he found a door, and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there who was lovely as any picture, nay, so beautiful that no words can express it, and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at Hans like a sea-cat!She, however, was bound with chains, and looked so mournfully at him that Hans felt great pity for her, and thought to himself, “Thou must deliver her out of the power of the wicked dwarf,” and gave him such a blow with his club that he fell down dead.Immediately the chains fell from the maiden, and Hans was enraptured with her beauty.She told him she was a King’s daughter whom a savage count had stolen away from her home, and imprisoned there among the rocks, because she would have nothing to say to him.The count had, however, set the dwarf as a watchman, and he had made her bear misery and vexation enough.And now Hans placed the maiden in the basket and had her drawn up; the basket came down again, but Hans did not trust his two companions, and thought, “They have already shown themselves to be false, and told me nothing about the dwarf; who knows what design they may have against me?”So he put his club in the basket, and it was lucky he did; for when the basket was half-way up, they let it fall again, and if Hans had really been sitting in it he would have been killed.But now he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths, and when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no counsel.“It is indeed sad,” said he to himself, “that I have to waste away down here,” and as he was thus walking backwards and forwards, he once more came to the little chamber where the maiden had been sitting, and saw that the dwarf had a ring on his finger which shone and sparkled.Then he drew it off and put it on, and when he turned it round on his finger, he suddenly heard something rustle over his head.He looked up and saw spirits of the air hovering above, who told him he was their master, and asked what his desire might be?Hans was at first struck dumb, but afterwards he said that they were to carry him above again.They obeyed instantly, and it was just as if he had flown up himself.When, however, he was above again, he found no one in sight.Fir-twister and Rock-splitter had hurried away, and had taken the beautiful maiden with them.But Hans turned the ring, and the spirits of the air came and told him that the two were on the sea.Hans ran and ran without stopping, until he came to the sea-shore, and there far, far out on the water, he perceived a little boat in which his faithless comrades were sitting; and in fierce anger he leapt, without thinking what he was doing, club in hand into the water, and began to swim, but the club, which weighed a hundredweight, dragged him deep down until he was all but drowned.Then in the very nick of time he turned his ring, and immediately the spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as lightning into the boat.He swung his club and gave his wicked comrades the reward they merited and threw them into the water, and then he sailed with the beautiful maiden, who had been in the greatest alarm, and whom he delivered for the second time, home to her father and mother, and married her, and all rejoiced exceedingly.</td></tr>

well, thou shalt have some food, but after that thou must die.”“We shall see,” said the soldier, and seated himself at the table, and began to cut away valiantly at the roast meat.“Brother Bright boots, come and eat,” cried he to the huntsman; “thou must be as hungry as I am, and cannot have better roast meat at home,” but the huntsman would not eat.The robbers looked at the soldier in astonishment, and said, “The rascal uses no ceremony.”After a while he said, “I have had enough food, now get me something good to drink.”The captain was in the mood to humour him in this also, and called to the old woman, “Bring a bottle out of the cellar, and mind it be of the best.”The soldier drew the cork out with a loud noise, and then went with the bottle to the huntsman and said, “Pay attention, brother, and thou shalt see something that will surprise thee; I am now going to drink the health of the whole clan.”Then he brandished the bottle over the heads of the robbers, and cried, “Long life to you all, but with your mouths open and your right hands lifted up,” and then he drank a hearty draught.Scarcely were the words said than they all sat motionless as if made of stone, and their mouths were open and their right hands stretched up in the air.The huntsman said to the soldier, “I see that thou art acquainted with tricks of another kind, but now come and let us go home.”“Oho, my dear brother, but that would be marching away far too soon; we have conquered the enemy, and must first take the booty.Those men there are sitting fast, and are opening their mouths with astonishment, but they will not be allowed to move until I permit them.Come, eat and drink.”The old woman had to bring another bottle of the best wine, and the soldier would not stir until he had eaten enough to last for three days.At last when day came, he said, “Now it is time to strike our tents, and that our march may be a short one, the old woman shall show us the nearest way to the town.”When they had arrived there, he went to his old comrades, and said, “Out in the forest I have found a nest full of gallows’ birds, come with me and we will take it.”The soldier led them, and said to the huntsman, “Thou must go back again with me to see how they shake when we seize them by the feet.”He placed the men round about the robbers, and then he took the bottle, drank a mouthful, brandished it above them, and cried, “Live again.”Instantly they all regained the power of movement, but were thrown down and bound hand and foot with cords.Then the soldier ordered them to be thrown into a cart as if they had been so many sacks, and said, “Now drive them straight to prison.”The huntsman, however, took one of the men aside and gave him another commission besides.“Brother Bright boots,” said the soldier, “we have safely routed the enemy and been well fed, now we will quietly walk behind them as if we were stragglers!”When they approached the town, the soldier saw a crowd of people pouring through the gate of the town who were raising loud cries of joy, and waving green boughs in the air.Then he saw that the entire body guard was coming up.“What can this mean?” said he to the huntsman.“Dost thou not know?” he replied, “that the King has for a long time been absent from his kingdom, and that today he is returning, and every one is going to meet him.”“But where is the King?” said the soldier, “I do not see him.”“Here he is,” answered the huntsman, “I am the King, and have announced my arrival.”Then he opened his hunting-coat, and his royal garments were visible.The soldier was alarmed, and fell on his knees and begged him to forgive him for having in his ignorance treated him as an equal, and spoken to him by such a name.But the King shook hands with him, and said, “Thou art a brave soldier, and hast saved my life.Thou shalt never again be in want, I will take care of thee.And if ever thou wouldst like to eat a piece of roast meat, as good as that in the robber’s house, come to the royal kitchen.But if thou wouldst drink a health, thou must first ask my permission.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When he had gone a short way he met a little iron man who asked him what he had there in the basket, to which replied Uele, for so was he named, “Frogs’ legs.”On this the little man said, “Well, so shall it be, and remain,” and went away.At length Uele arrived at the palace, and made it known that he had brought apples which would cure the King’s daughter if she ate them.This delighted the King hugely, and he caused Uele to be brought before him; but, alas!when he opened the basket, instead of having apples in it he had frogs’ legs which were still kicking about.On this the King grew angry, and had him driven out of the house.When he got home he told his father how it had fared with him.Then the father sent the next son, who was called Seame, but all went with him just as it had gone with Uele.He also met the little iron man, who asked what he had there in the basket.Seame said, “Hogs’ bristles,” and the iron man said, “well, so shall it be, and remain.”When Seame got to the King’s palace and said he brought apples with which the King’s daughter might eat herself well, they did not want to let him go in, and said that one fellow had already been there, and had treated them as if they were fools.Seame, however, maintained that he certainly had the apples, and that they ought to let him go in.At length they believed him, and led him to the King.But when he uncovered the basket, he had but hogs’ bristles.This enraged the King most terribly, so he caused Seame to be whipped out of the house.When he got home he related all that had befallen him, then the youngest boy, whose name was Hans, but who was always called Stupid Hans, came and asked his father if he might go with some apples.“Oh!” said the father, “thou wouldst be just the right fellow for such a thing!If the clever ones can’t manage it, what canst thou do?”The boy, however, did not believe him, and said, “Indeed, father, I wish to go.”“Just get away, thou stupid fellow, thou must wait till thou art wiser,” said the father to that, and turned his back.Hans, however, pulled at the back of his smock—frock and said, “Indeed, father, I wish to go.”“Well, then, so far as I am concerned thou mayst go, but thou wilt soon come home again!” replied the old man in a spiteful voice.The boy, however, was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy.“Well, act like a fool!thou growest more stupid every day!” said the father again.Hans, however, did not care about that, and did not let it spoil his pleasure, but as it was then night, he thought he might as well wait until the morrow, for he could not get to court that day.All night long he could not sleep in his bed, and if he did doze for a moment, he dreamt of beautiful maidens, of palaces, of gold, and of silver, and all kinds of things of that sort.Early in the morning, he went forth on his way, and directly afterwards the little shabby-looking man in his iron clothes, came to him and asked what he was carrying in the basket.Hans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the King’s daughter was to eat herself well.“Then,” said the little man, “so shall they be, and remain.”But at the court they would none of them let Hans go in, for they said two had already been there who had told them that they were bringing apples, and one of them had frogs’ legs, and the other hogs’ bristles.Hans, however, resolutely maintained that he most certainly had no frogs’ legs, but some of the most beautiful apples in the whole kingdom.As he spoke so pleasantly, the door-keeper thought he could not be telling a lie, and asked him to go in, and he was right, for when Hans uncovered his basket in the King’s presence, golden-yellow apples came tumbling out.The King was delighted, and caused some of them to be taken to his daughter, and then waited in anxious expectation until news should be brought to him of the effect they had.But before much time had passed by, news was brought to him: but who do you think it was who came?It was his daughter herself!As soon as she had eaten of those apples, she was cured, and sprang out of her bed.The joy the King felt cannot be described!But now he did not want to give his daughter in marriage to Hans, and said he must first make him a boat which would go quicker on dry land than on water.Hans agreed to the conditions, and went home, and related how it had fared with him.Then the father sent Uele into the forest to make a boat of that kind.He worked diligently, and whistled all the time.At mid-day, when the sun was at the highest, came the little iron man and asked what he was making?Uele gave him for answer, “Wooden bowls for the kitchen.”The iron man said, “So it shall be, and remain.”By evening Uele thought he had now made the boat, but when he wanted to get into it, he had nothing but wooden bowls.The next day Seame went into the forest, but everything went with him just as it had done with Uele.On the third day Stupid Hans went.He worked away most industriously, so that the whole forest resounded with the heavy strokes, and all the while he sang and whistled right merrily.At mid-day, when it was the hottest, the little man came again, and asked what he was making?“A boat which will go quicker on dry land than on the water,” replied Hans, “ and when I have finished it, I am to have the King’s daughter for my wife.”“Well,” said the little man, “such an one shall it be, and remain.”In the evening, when the sun had turned into gold, Hans finished his boat, and all that was wanted for it.He got into it and rowed to the palace.The boat went as swiftly as the wind.The King saw it from afar, but would not give his daughter to Hans yet, and said he must first take a hundred hares out to pasture from early morning until late evening, and if one of them got away, he should not have his daughter.Hans was contented with this, and the next day went with his flock to the pasture, and took great care that none of them ran away.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Before many hours had passed came a servant from the palace, and told Hans that he must give her a hare instantly, for some visitors had come unexpectedly.Hans, however, was very well aware what that meant, and said he would not give her one; the King might set some hare soup before his guest next day.The maid, however, would not believe in his refusal, and at last she began to get angry with him.Then Hans said that if the King’s daughter came herself, he would give her a hare.The maid told this in the palace, and the daughter did go herself.In the meantime, however, the little man came again to Hans, and asked him what he was doing there.He said he had to watch over a hundred hares and see that none of them ran away, and then he might marry the King’s daughter and be King.“Good,” said the little man, “there is a whistle for thee, and if one of them runs away, just whistle with it, and then it will come back again.”When the King’s daughter came, Hans gave her a hare into her apron; but when she had gone about a hundred steps with it, he whistled, and the hare jumped out of the apron, and before she could turn round was back to the flock again.When the evening came the hare-herd whistled once more, and looked to see if all were there, and then drove them to the palace.The King wondered how Hans had been able to take a hundred hares to graze without losing any of them; he would, however, not give him his daughter yet, and said he must now bring him a feather from the Griffin’s tail.Hans set out at once, and walked straight forwards.In the evening he came to a castle, and there he asked for a night’s lodging, for at that time there were no inns.The lord of the castle promised him that with much pleasure, and asked where he was going.Hans answered, “To the Griffin.”“Oh! to the Griffin!They tell me he knows everything, and I have lost the key of an iron money-chest; so you might be so good as to ask him where it is.”“Yes, indeed,” said Hans, “I will do that.”Early the next morning he went onwards, and on his way arrived at another castle in which he again stayed the night.When the people who lived there learnt that he was going to the Griffin, they said they had in the house a daughter who was ill, and that they had already tried every means to cure her, but none of them had done her any good, and he might be so kind as to ask the Griffin what would make their daughter healthy again.Hans said he would willingly do that, and went onwards.Then he came to a lake, and instead of a ferry-boat, a tall, tall man was there who had to carry everybody across.The man asked Hans whither he was journeying.“To the Griffin,” said Hans.“Then when you get to him,” said the man, “just ask him why I am forced to carry everybody over the lake.”“Yes, indeed, most certainly I’ll do that,” said Hans.Then the man took him up on his shoulders, and carried him across.At length Hans arrived at the Griffin’s house, but the wife only was at home, and not the Griffin himself.Then the woman asked him what he wanted.Thereupon he told her everything; that he had to get a feather out of the Griffin’s tail, and that there was a castle where they had lost the key of their money-chest, and he was to ask the Griffin where it was?-that in another castle the daughter was ill, and he was to learn what would cure her?—and then not far from thence there was a lake and a man beside it, who was forced to carry people across it, and he was very anxious to learn why the man was obliged to do it.Then said the woman, “But look here, my good friend, no Christian can speak to the Griffin; he devours them all; but if you like, you can lie down under his bed, and in the night, when he is quite fast asleep, you can reach out and pull a feather out of his tail, and as for those things which you are to learn, I will ask about them myself.”Hans was quite satisfied with this, and got under the bed.In the evening, the Griffin came home, and as soon as he entered the room, said, “Wife, I smell a Christian.”“Yes,” said the woman, “one was here to-day, but he went away again;” and on that the Griffin said no more.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Then he led her out of the town into the field, and showed her the stream where the little boat had been pushed off, and then he said, “I am tired; sit down, I will sleep awhile on thy lap.”And he laid his head on her lap, and fell asleep.When he was asleep, she first drew the ring from his finger, then she drew away the foot which was under him, leaving only the slipper behind her, and she took her child in her arms, and wished herself back in her own kingdom.When he awoke, there he lay quite deserted, and his wife and child were gone, and so was the ring from his finger, the slipper only was still there as a token.“Home to thy parents thou canst not return,” thought he, “they would say that thou wast a wizard; thou must be off, and walk on until thou arrivest in thine own kingdom.”So he went away and came at length to a hill by which three giants were standing, disputing with each other because they did not know how to divide their father’s property.When they saw him passing by, they called to him and said little men had quick wits, and that he was to divide their inheritance for them.The inheritance, however, consisted of a sword, which had this property that if any one took it in his hand, and said, “All heads off but mine,” every head would lie on the ground; secondly, of a cloak which made any one who put it on invisible; thirdly, of a pair of boots which could transport the wearer to any place he wished in a moment.He said, “Give me the three things that I may see if they are still in good condition.”They gave him the cloak, and when he had put it on, he was invisible and changed into a fly.Then he resumed his own form and said, “The cloak is a good one, now give me the sword.”They said, “No, we will not give thee that; if thou were to say, All heads off but mine,’ all our heads would be off, and thou alone wouldst be left with thine.”Nevertheless they gave it to him with the condition that he was only to try it against a tree.This he did, and the sword cut in two the trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw.Then he wanted to have the boots likewise, but they said, “No, we will not give them; if thou hadst them on thy feet and wert to wish thyself at the top of the hill, we should be left down here with nothing.”“Oh, no,” said he, “I will not do that.”So they gave him the boots as well.And now when he had got all these things, he thought of nothing but his wife and his child, and said as though to himself, “Oh, if I were but on the Golden Mountain,” and at the same moment he vanished from the sight of the giants, and thus their inheritance was divided.When he was near his palace, he heard sounds of joy, and fiddles, and flutes, and the people told him that his wife was celebrating her wedding with another.Then he fell into a rage, and said, “False woman, she betrayed and deserted me whilst I was asleep!”So he put on his cloak, and unseen by all went into the palace.When he entered the dining-hall a great table was spread with delicious food, and the guests were eating and drinking, and laughing, and jesting.She sat on a royal seat in the midst of them in splendid apparel, with a crown on her head.He placed himself behind her, and no one saw him.When she put a piece of meat on a plate for herself, he took it away and ate it, and when she poured out a glass of wine for herself, he took it away and drank it.She was always helping herself to something, and yet she never got anything, for plate and glass disappeared immediately.Then dismayed and ashamed, she arose and went to her chamber and wept, but he followed her there.She said, “Has the devil power over me, or did my deliverer never come?”Then he struck her in the face, and said, “Did thy deliverer never come?It is he who has thee in his power, thou traitor.Have I deserved this from thee?”Then he made himself visible, went into the hall, and cried, “The wedding is at an end, the true King has returned.”The kings, princes, and councillors who were assembled there, ridiculed and mocked him, but he did not trouble to answer them, and said, “Will you go away, or not?”On this they tried to seize him and pressed upon him, but he drew his sword and said, “All heads off but mine,” and all the heads rolled on the ground, and he alone was master, and once more King of the Golden Mountain.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >神偷手来到邻近的城里；他买来一个老农妇的衣服穿了上去。然后，他把自己的脸涂成褐色，又在上面画上皱纹，这样就没人能认出他来了。后来，他在一个桶里装满了陈年的匈牙利酒，还在酒里混入了烈性安眠药。他将小桶装进背上背着的筐子里，步履蹒跚地走到了伯爵的城堡前。他到达时天色已晚了。他坐在院子里的一块石头上咳嗽起来，就像是个患哮喘病的老妇人似的，还揉搓着双手，仿佛很冷的样子。在马厩的门前，有几个士兵围着火堆躺着，有一个士兵注意到了老妇人，便朝她喊道：“到这里来吧，老妈妈，到这儿来烤烤火。你今晚也没有住处，就只能在这里凑合一下了。”老妇人蹒跚着走到士兵面前，恳请他们帮忙取下背筐，然后就挨着士兵在火边坐下了。一个士兵问道：“你这小桶里装的是什么呀，老太婆？”她答道：“是一点优质的葡萄酒。我靠做这样的小买卖为生，要是你们给点钱又说几句好话的话，我愿意给你们喝一杯。”士兵说：“那就给我们倒点吧。”他喝了一杯后，说道：“这酒真不错，我要再喝一杯。”于是，他又让老妇人倒了一些，其他人也喝起来。有人朝那些在马厩里的士兵喊道：“喂，兄弟们，这个老妈妈有和她一样老的陈年老酒，快来喝点儿吧，这可比烤火更能暖胃呀。”老妇人背着筐子进了马厩里。马厩里一个士兵坐在带马鞍的马背上，另一个手里握着马笼头，还有一个人用手抓着马尾巴。他们要喝多少，老妇人就给他们倒多少，直到最后酒都喝光了。不一会儿，马笼头就从士兵手中脱落了，他一头倒地酣睡起来，另一个人也松开了马尾巴倒在地上，鼾声更响亮。那个坐在马背上的士兵还坐在那里，只是头已经快垂到马脖子上了，最后也睡了过去，呼吸声像是拉风箱一般。马厩外面的士兵已睡着很久了，像死人一样纹丝不动地躺在地上。神偷手见自己成功后，他往那个拿马笼头的士兵手里塞了一根绳子来代替马笼头，往那个揪住马尾巴的士兵手里塞了一把稻草，可是他该怎样处理坐在马背上的那个人呢？他不想将他推下马背，因为那样可能惊醒他，使他大喊大叫。终于，他想出了一个好主意，他解开马鞍上的绳子，又把绳子紧紧系在墙上的钉圈里，这样就把那个熟睡的士兵和马鞍一起吊在空中了，然后，他又把绳子牢牢地缠在柱子上。神偷手飞快地解开拴马的绳子，可他如果骑着马穿过院子里的石板路的话，人们会听到院子里的声音的。于是，他用破布裹住马蹄，悄悄地牵着马走了出去，然后一跃跳上马背逃走了。</td>
		<td class="en">The master thief went to the nearest town; there he bought the clothes of an old peasant woman, and put them on.Then he stained his face brown, and painted wrinkles on it as well, so that no one could have recognized him.Then he filled a small cask with old Hungary wine in which was mixed a powerful sleeping-drink.He put the cask in a basket, which he took on his back, and walked with slow and tottering steps to the count’s castle.It was already dark when he arrived.He sat down on a stone in the courtyard and began to cough, like an asthmatic old woman, and to rub his hands as if he were cold.In front of the door of the stable some soldiers were lying round a fire; one of them observed the woman, and called out to her, “Come nearer, old mother, and warm thyself beside us.After all, thou hast no bed for the night, and must take one where thou canst find it.”The old woman tottered up to them, begged them to lift the basket from her back, and sat down beside them at the fire.“What hast thou got in thy little cask, old lady?” asked one.“A good mouthful of wine,” she answered.“I live by trade, for money and fair words I am quite ready to let you have a glass.”“Let us have it here, then,” said the soldier, and when he had tasted one glass he said, “When wine is good, I like another glass,” and had another poured out for himself, and the rest followed his example.“Hallo, comrades,” cried one of them to those who were in the stable, “here is an old goody who has wine that is as old as herself; take a draught, it will warm your stomachs far better than our fire.”The old woman carried her cask into the stable.One of the soldiers had seated himself on the saddled riding horse, another held its bridle in his hand, a third had laid hold of its tail.She poured out as much as they wanted until the spring ran dry.It was not long before the bridle fell from the hand of the one, and he fell down and began to snore, the other left hold of the tail, lay down and snored still louder.The one who was sitting in the saddle, did remain sitting, but bent his head almost down to the horse’s neck, and slept and blew with his mouth like the bellows of a forge.The soldiers outside had already been asleep for a long time, and were lying on the ground motionless, as if dead.When the master thief saw that he had succeeded, he gave the first a rope in his hand instead of the bridle, and the other who had been holding the tail, a wisp of straw, but what was he to do with the one who was sitting on the horse’s back?He did not want to throw him down, for he might have awakened and have uttered a cry.He had a good idea, he unbuckled the girths of the saddle, tied a couple of ropes which were hanging to a ring on the wall fast to the saddle, and drew the sleeping rider up into the air on it, then he twisted the rope round the posts, and made it fast.He soon unloosed the horse from the chain, but if he had ridden over the stony pavement of the yard they would have heard the noise in the castle.So he wrapped the horse’s hoofs in old rags, led him carefully out, leapt upon him, and galloped off.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前，有一个磨坊主和他的妻子一起过着幸福的生活。他们有钱有地，生活过得一年比一年富足。但是厄运却像小偷一样在夜里不期而至，正如当初他们的财富逐年增加一样，现在他们的财富却一年一年减少，直到最后，甚至连磨坊主居住的磨坊几乎都不再是他自己的了。他陷入了极度的沮丧之中，当忙完一天的工作躺下来的时候，根本睡不着觉，只是在床上忧心忡忡，辗转反侧。一天早上，天还没亮他便起床了，来到外边，心想这样自己的心里可能会舒服点。正当走过磨坊水坝之时，清晨的第一缕阳光破晓而出，他听到池塘里传来一阵潺潺的水声。他转身一看，只见一个美女从水中缓缓浮现。她用娇柔的手轻拢着长长的秀发，秀发从双肩披散下来，遮掩起着她白皙的躯体。他很快就明白她是磨坊水塘里的水妖，于是便非常害怕，不知道是该跑掉，还是该原地不动。不料水妖却用甜美的声音叫着他的名字，还问他为什么如此伤心。磨坊主起初惊呆了，可是当他听到她语气如此和善，便壮着胆告诉她说，自己以前一直过着富足幸福的生活，但是现在却穷困无比，他自己也不知道该怎么办了。“别担心，”水妖说道，“我会让你变得比以前任何时候都更富有，更幸福，只是你要答应把家里刚出生的新生命交给我。”“还会是别的什么呢？”磨坊主想着，“无非是只小狗或小猫。”于是便答应了她的要求。水妖再次沉到了水下，他感到快慰，心情愉悦地朝磨坊匆匆走去。还没走到磨坊，便有一个女佣从房间里走出来大声向他报喜，原来他的妻子刚刚生了个儿子。磨坊主仿佛是被闪电击中了一般，呆立在那里，他才明白，狡猾的水妖原来早就知道这件事，他被骗了。他耷拉着头走到妻子的床边，妻子问他说：“我们有这么一个可爱的宝贝，你为什么还不高兴呢？”于是他将自己刚刚的遭遇和给水妖许诺都一一讲给妻子听。“如果失去了我的孩子，金钱和财富对我来说又有什么用呢？”他继续说道，“可是我该怎么办呢？”就连那些前来道喜的亲友们也不知道如何是好。与此同时，磨坊主的家业再次兴旺起来。他经营得一切样样顺利，箱子柜子仿佛自动就装满了，而橱柜里的钱也在一夜之间陡然增多。没过多久，他就变得比以往任何时候更富有了。但是面对这一切，他并不能安心过幸福生活，因为曾经给水妖的许诺一直在内心深处折磨着他。每当他经过水塘的时候，他就担心水妖会冒出来问他要债。他从来都不让孩子独自到水塘附近去。“小心啊，”他对孩子说，“如果你靠近水塘，里面就会伸出一只手，把你抓住并拉下水去。”但是一年又一年过去了，水妖再也没有出现过，磨坊主也开始放心了。小男孩长到十几岁，便跟了一个猎人当学徒。他学会了打猎，成了一名优秀的猎手，村长便雇佣了他。村里有一个美丽善良的姑娘，猎人喜欢上了她，磨坊主知道后，送了他一所小房子，两个人便结婚了，他们相亲相爱，过着幸福安宁的生活。</td>
		<td class="en">There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great contentment.They had money and land, and their prosperity increased year by year more and more.But ill-luck comes like a thief in the night, as their wealth had increased so did it again decrease, year by year, and at last the miller could hardly call the mill in which he lived, his own.He was in great distress, and when he lay down after his day’s work, found no rest, but tossed about in his bed, full of care.One morning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air, thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter.As he was stepping over the mill-dam the first sunbeam was just breaking forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond.He turned round and perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out of the water.Her long hair, which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands, fell down on both sides, and covered her white body.He soon saw that she was the Nix of the Mill-pond, and in his fright did not know whether he should run away or stay where he was.But the nix made her sweet voice heard, called him by his name, and asked him why he was so sad.The miller was at first struck dumb, but when he heard her speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he had formerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so poor that he did not know what to do.“Be easy,” answered the nix, “I will make thee richer and happier than thou hast ever been before, only thou must promise to give me the young thing which has just been born in thy house.”“What else can that be,” thought the miller, “but a young puppy or kitten?” and he promised her what she desired.The nix descended into the water again, and he hurried back to his mill, consoled and in good spirits.He had not yet reached it, when the maid-servant came out of the house, and cried to him to rejoice, for his wife had given birth to a little boy.The miller stood as if struck by lightning; he saw very well that the cunning nix had been aware of it, and had cheated him.Hanging his head, he went up to his wife’s bedside and when she said, “Why dost thou not rejoice over the fine boy?” he told her what had befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had given to the nix.“Of what use to me are riches and prosperity?” he added, “if I am to lose my child; but what can I do?”Even the relations, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not know what to say.In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller’s house.All that he undertook succeeded, it was as if presses and coffers filled themselves of their own accord, and as if money multiplied nightly in the cupboards.It was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before.But he could not rejoice over it untroubled, for the bargain which he had made with the nix tormented his soul.Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared she might ascend and remind him of his debt.He never let the boy himself go near the water.“Beware,” he said to him, “if thou dost but touch the water, a hand will rise, seize thee, and draw thee down.”But as year after year went by and the nix did not show herself again, the miller began to feel at ease.The boy grew up to be a youth and was apprenticed to a huntsman.When he had learnt everything, and had become an excellent huntsman, the lord of the village took him into his service.In the village lived a beautiful and true-hearted maiden, who pleased the huntsman, and when his master perceived that, he gave him a little house, the two were married, lived peacefully and happily, and loved each other with all their hearts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，猎人在追赶着一头獐鹿，鹿逃出了森林，跑到空旷的田野上，他紧追着鹿，最终一箭射中了它。他并没有发觉自己已经是在危险的磨坊水池边了，将鹿的内脏掏出来以后，便走到水塘边去洗沾满鹿血的双手。谁知他的手还没伸进水里，水妖就冒了出来，她笑着用湿漉漉的胳膊抱住他，迅速将他拖到了水下，很快池水便将他淹没了。傍晚时分，丈夫还没回家，妻子便有点惊慌。她出门去寻找丈夫，因为猎人以前经常告诉她说自己必须要时刻提防水妖的暗算，也不敢到水塘的附近活动，她已经猜到出什么事了。她赶忙来到水池边，当她看到丈夫放在岸边的猎袋时，便确信不幸真的发生了。她失声痛哭，握紧拳头，呼唤着自己爱人的名字，但是一切都无济于事。她连忙跑到池塘的另一边，再次呼唤他，她狠狠地咒骂了水妖，但还是没有回应。水面依然非常平静，只能看到水中弯弯的新月默默注视着她。可怜的女人没有离开水塘。她绕着水塘一圈一圈不停地跑啊跑，一会儿沉默不语，一会儿放声痛哭，一会儿轻声啜泣。最后她已是筋疲力竭了，便一头倒在地上，沉沉地睡了过去。这时她做了一个梦。她梦到自己在巨大的岩石之间心惊胆战地往上爬，荆棘缠绕着她的脚，雨水抽打着她的脸，大风吹乱了她的长发。当她到达山顶的时候，看到的却是完全不同的一副景象，蔚蓝的天空，轻柔的微风，平缓的坡地，碧绿的草地上各色鲜花争奇斗艳，上面坐落着一间漂亮的小屋。她走上去推开了门，便看见一位白发苍苍的老太太坐在那里，亲切地向她招了招手。就在这时，可怜的女人醒来了，天已经亮了，于是她马上决定去追寻她的梦。她很吃力地爬上了山，山上的一切和她晚上在梦中见到的一模一样。老太太和蔼地接待了她，并指着一把椅子让她坐下。“你一定是遇到什么不幸了吧，”她说，“你看你都找到我这僻静的小屋了。”女人流着泪讲述了自己的不幸遭遇。“别担心，”老太太说，“我来帮助你。给你这把金梳子。等到月圆的那天，你就到池塘边坐在岸上，然后用这把梳子梳你那长长的黑发。梳完之后就把梳子放在岸上，接着你就会看到将要发生的事情。”女人回到家里，但是月圆前的这段时间却过得如此漫长。终于，一轮明亮的圆月挂上了天际，她跑到磨坊池塘边，坐下来用金梳子梳着自己长长的黑发，梳完后便把它放在了岸边。没过多久，湖底便翻腾起来，一个浪涛涌起来，翻滚到岸边便将梳子卷走了。梳子还没沉到池底，便看到水面分成了两半，接着猎人的头便冒了出来。他没有说话，只是用一种悲伤的目光望了一眼妻子。就在此刻，第二个浪涛涌了过来，将猎人的头部整个淹没了。一切都不见了，池水恢复了以往的平静，只有一轮圆月映照在水面上。女人非常伤心地回到家里，但是她却在夜里再次梦到了老太太的小屋。第二天早上，她再次出发，向睿智的老太太诉说了自己的不幸。老人给了她一支金笛并对她说：“等到下次月圆的时候，你就带着这支笛子去池边，吹一首好听的曲子，吹完后把它放在岸上，就会看到将要发生的事情。”女人按照老人说的做了。她刚刚把笛子放在岸边，池底便涌动起来，接着一个浪打了过来，将笛子冲走了。紧接着池水便分成了两半，这次不光是猎人的头，他的上半身也跟着露了出来。他满怀期望地向妻子伸出了双臂，谁知又一个浪头卷了过来，淹没了他，又将他拖入水底。“唉，这对于我又有什么用呢？”不幸的女人说道，“我看到了心爱的人，却又立刻失去了他。”绝望再次涌上她的心头，但是梦境却第三次将她带到了老太太的小屋。她又去了，睿智的老太太给了她一辆金纺车，并安慰她道：“一切都还没完成呢。等下次月圆的时候，你带着这辆纺车坐在岸边，纺上满满一轴线，纺完后就将纺车放在水边，你将会看到要发生的事情。”女人丝毫不差地照办了。圆月刚一升起，她便带着金纺车来到岸边，然后认认真真地纺起线来，直到亚麻用完了，线轴缠满了线，她才停下来。纺车刚一放到岸上，池底便比以往更加猛烈地涌动起来，一个巨浪扑过来，将纺车卷走了。紧接着，一股水柱升了起来，将猎人从头到脚托到空中。他迅速跳上岸，抓起妻子的手就跑。但是他们还没跑几步，整个池子便发出恐怖的咆哮声，池水涌上来，冲向空旷的田野。这两个逃亡的人眼看就要没命了，女人情急之下便哀求老太太相救，就在这一瞬间，夫妻俩都变了身，妻子变成了一只蟾蜍，丈夫变成了一只青蛙。席卷而来的洪水并没有将他们淹死，却将他们冲散，带到了很远的地方。洪水退却后，夫妻两人回到了陆地并恢复了人形，可是他们谁也不知道对方在哪里，他们都置身于陌生人中，没人知道他们的家乡。高山和深谷将他们隔开了。为了谋生，两个人不得不放起羊来。许多年过去了，他们赶着羊群走过田野，穿过森林，心中充满了悲伤和思念。当春天再一次降临人间的时候，一天他们都赶着羊群出来了，幸运的是，他们离彼此越来越近。他们在山谷里相遇，却没有认出彼此，可是他们都为以后不再孤独而感到开心。从此以后，他们便每天一起放羊。他们虽然不怎么说话，却感到无比欣慰。一天晚上，一轮圆月升上天空，羊都已经休息了，牧羊人从口袋里拿出笛子，吹了一曲优美却又哀伤的曲子。他吹完后便发现牧羊女在伤心地哭泣。“你为什么哭呢？”他问。“唉，”她回答说，“上一次，也是在一个圆月当空的晚上，我用笛子吹了这首曲子，我心爱的人就从水里露出头来。”他看着她，仿佛突然脱去了眼罩，认出了心爱的妻子，而她也望着他，月光照在了他的脸上，她也认出了他。他们相拥在一起，相互亲吻着对方。他们是否幸福美满，自不必赘述了。</td>
		<td class="en">One day the huntsman was chasing a roe; and when the animal turned aside from the forest into the open country, he pursued it and at last shot it.He did not notice that he was now in the neighbourhood of the dangerous mill-pond, and went, after he had disembowelled the stag, to the water, in order to wash his blood-stained hands.Scarcely, however, had he dipped them in than the nix ascended, smilingly wound her dripping arms around him, and drew him quickly down under the waves, which closed over him.When it was evening, and the huntsman did not return home, his wife became alarmed.She went out to seek him, and as he had often told her that he had to be on his guard against the snares of the nix, and dared not venture into the neighbourhood of the mill-pond, she already suspected what had happened.She hastened to the water, and when she found his hunting-pouch lying on the shore, she could no longer have any doubt of the misfortune.Lamenting her sorrow, and wringing her hands, she called on her beloved by name, but in vain.She hurried across to the other side of the pond, and called him anew; she reviled the nix with harsh words, but no answer followed.The surface of the water remained calm, only the crescent moon stared steadily back at her.The poor woman did not leave the pond.With hasty steps, she paced round and round it, without resting a moment, sometimes in silence, sometimes uttering a loud cry, sometimes softly sobbing.At last her strength came to an end, she sank down to the ground and fell into a heavy sleep.Presently a dream took possession of her.She was anxiously climbing upwards between great masses of rock; thorns and briars caught her feet, the rain beat in her face, and the wind tossed her long hair about.When she had reached the summit, quite a different sight presented itself to her; the sky was blue, the air soft, the ground sloped gently downwards, and on a green meadow, gay with flowers of every colour, stood a pretty cottage.She went up to it and opened the door; there sat an old woman with white hair, who beckoned to her kindly.At that very moment, the poor woman awoke, day had already dawned, and she at once resolved to act in accordance with her dream.She laboriously climbed the mountain; everything was exactly as she had seen it in the night.The old woman received her kindly, and pointed out a chair on which she might sit.“Thou must have met with a misfortune,” she said, “since thou hast sought out my lonely cottage.”With tears, the woman related what had befallen her.“Be comforted,” said the old woman, “I will help thee.Here is a golden comb for thee.Tarry till the full moon has risen, then go to the mill-pond, seat thyself on the shore, and comb thy long black hair with this comb.When thou hast done, lay it down on the bank, and thou wilt see what will happen.”The woman returned home, but the time till the full moon came, passed slowly.At last the shining disc appeared in the heavens, then she went out to the mill-pond, sat down and combed her long black hair with the golden comb, and when she had finished, she laid it down at the water’s edge.It was not long before there was a movement in the depths, a wave rose, rolled to the shore, and bore the comb away with it.In not more than the time necessary for the comb to sink to the bottom, the surface of the water parted, and the head of the huntsman arose.He did not speak, but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances.At the same instant, a second wave came rushing up, and covered the man’s head.All had vanished, the mill-pond lay peaceful as before, and nothing but the face of the full moon shone on it.Full of sorrow, the woman went back, but again the dream showed her the cottage of the old woman.Next morning she again set out and complained of her woes to the wise woman.The old woman gave her a golden flute, and said, “Tarry till the full moon comes again, then take this flute; play a beautiful air on it, and when thou hast finished, lay it on the sand; then thou wilt see what will happen.”The wife did as the old woman told her.No sooner was the flute lying on the sand than there was a stirring in the depths, and a wave rushed up and bore the flute away with it.Immediately afterwards the water parted, and not only the head of the man, but half of his body also arose.He stretched out his arms longingly towards her, but a second wave came up, covered him, and drew him down again.“Alas, what does it profit me?” said the unhappy woman, “that I should see my beloved, only to lose him again!”Despair filled her heart anew, but the dream led her a third time to the house of the old woman.She set out, and the wise woman gave her a golden spinning-wheel, consoled her and said, “All is not yet fulfilled, tarry until the time of the full moon, then take the spinning-wheel, seat thyself on the shore, and spin the spool full, and when thou hast done that, place the spinning-wheel near the water, and thou wilt see what will happen.”The woman obeyed all she said exactly; as soon as the full moon showed itself, she carried the golden spinning-wheel to the shore, and span industriously until the flax came to an end, and the spool was quite filled with the threads.No sooner was the wheel standing on the shore than there was a more violent movement than before in the depths of the pond, and a mighty wave rushed up, and bore the wheel away with it.Immediately the head and the whole body of the man rose into the air, in a water-spout.He quickly sprang to the shore, caught his wife by the hand and fled.But they had scarcely gone a very little distance, when the whole pond rose with a frightful roar, and streamed out over the open country.The fugitives already saw death before their eyes, when the woman in her terror implored the help of the old woman, and in an instant they were transformed, she into a toad, he into a frog.The flood which had overtaken them could not destroy them, but it tore them apart and carried them far away.When the water had dispersed and they both touched dry land again, they regained their human form, but neither knew where the other was; they found themselves among strange people, who did not know their native land.High mountains and deep valleys lay between them.In order to keep themselves alive, they were both obliged to tend sheep.For many long years they drove their flocks through field and forest and were full of sorrow and longing.When spring had once more broken forth on the earth, they both went out one day with their flocks, and as chance would have it, they drew near each other.They met in a valley, but did not recognize each other; yet they rejoiced that they were no longer so lonely.Henceforth they each day drove their flocks to the same place; they did not speak much, but they felt comforted.One evening when the full moon was shining in the sky, and the sheep were already at rest, the shepherd pulled the flute out of his pocket, and played on it a beautiful but sorrowful air.When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly.“Why art thou weeping?” he asked.“Alas,” answered she, “thus shone the full moon when I played this air on the flute for the last time, and the head of my beloved rose out of the water.”He looked at her, and it seemed as if a veil fell from his eyes, and he recognized his dear wife, and when she looked at him, and the moon shone in his face she knew him also.They embraced and kissed each other, and no one need ask if they were happy.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There was once on a time a Queen to whom God had given no children.Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter.Then an angel from heaven came to her and said, “Be at rest, thou shalt have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.”Then she went to the King, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the King was filled with gladness.Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream.It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep.Then came the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the Queen’s apron and on her dress.Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the King and accused the Queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts.When the King saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen, and had his wife put into it, and walled up.Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger.But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The cook, however, thought to himself, “If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.”So he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak, and said to him, “Wish for a beautiful palace for thyself with a garden, and all else that pertains to it.”Scarcely were the words out of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.After a while the cook said to him, “It is not well for thee to be so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.”Then the King’s son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her.The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman.The thought, however, occurred to him that the King’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril.So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said, “Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if thou dost not do it, thou shalt lose thy life.”Thereupon he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said, “Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed any one?”The cook once more said, “If thou dost not do it, it shall cost thee thy own life.”When he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy, “Lie down in thy bed, and draw the clothes over thee.”Then the wicked wretch came in and said, “Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?”The girl reached the plate to him, but the King’s son threw off the quilt, and said, “Thou old sinner, why didst thou want to kill me?Now will I pronounce thy sentence.Thou shalt become a black poodle and have a gold collar round thy neck, and shalt eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from thy throat.”And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat.The King’s son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still alive.At length he said to the maiden, “I will go home to my own country; if thou wilt go with me, I will provide for thee.”“Ah,” she replied, “the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown?”As she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took her with him.Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him.He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top.Then he mounted up and looked inside, and cried, “Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you dead?”She answered, “I have just eaten, and am still satisfied,” for she thought the angels were there.Said he, “I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will speedily deliver you.”Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could give him a place.The King said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the district or country.Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table.So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to wish.Two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the King, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had none at all for years.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前有个年轻人，他学会了锁匠活，便对父亲说，他现在想去外面的世界闯一闯，碰碰运气。“很好，”父亲说道，“我非常同意你的想法。”父亲还给了他一些钱当路费。于是他便四处飘荡，想找点活儿干。过了一段时间，他决定不再去找锁匠活了，因为他已经不再喜欢这一行了，相反喜欢上了狩猎。有一天他在路上闲逛，遇到了一位身穿绿色衣服的猎人，猎人问他从什么地方来的，又要到什么地方去。小伙子回答说自己是个锁匠学徒，可是现在不想做锁匠了，很喜欢打猎，不知猎人肯不肯教他打猎。“噢，可以，”猎人说，“只要你肯跟我走。”于是年轻人就跟着他去了，跟了猎人几年，从他那儿学会了狩猎的技术。学会狩猎后，小伙子决定去别处闯闯。临别之时，猎人并没有给他任何报酬，而是送了他一支气枪，这支枪很不一般，只要用它射击目标物，肯定是百发百中。小伙子出发之后，来到一片非常非常大的森林，他走了整整一天都没有走到尽头。天黑的时候，他爬上了一棵大树，这样可以避免野兽的侵袭。快到午夜之时，他仿佛看见远处闪烁着一点微光。于是他便穿过树枝向下往光亮处看去，弄清楚它的位置。但他还是先把帽子摘下来，朝着亮光的方向扔下去，这样他从树上下来后，就可以把帽子作为路标向前走。随后，他下了树，走到帽子那里把它戴上，然后继续向前走去。他越往前走，亮光就变得越大，等他走近一看，那原来是一个硕大的火堆，旁边坐着三个巨人，他们正用炙叉叉着一头牛在火上烤呢。这时候，其中的一个巨人说道：“我得尝尝肉是不是马上就可以吃了。”于是他便撕了一块下来，肉还没到嘴边，就被猎人一枪射飞了。“嘿呀，风还把肉从我手中刮跑啦！”于是他便又撕了一块。谁知他刚张嘴要咬，肉又被猎人一枪射飞了。这时巨人便打了坐在旁边的同伴一个耳光，并厉声怒喝道：“你干嘛抢走我的肉？”“我没有抢你的肉啊，”旁边的巨人说道，“一定是哪位神枪手把你的肉给射飞了。”巨人又撕了一块肉下来，但是还没拿稳，就让猎人给一枪射飞了。这时巨人说：“能把人嘴边的食物射飞，那一定是个顶级射手，这样的高手对我们会有用的。”于是他便大声喊道：“出来吧神枪手，出来和我们一起坐到火边吃东西，我们不会伤害你的，你倘若不出来，我们可要动手抓你啦，那你就完喽！”听了这些话，小伙子便走到他们跟前，告诉他们说自己是一个训练有素的猎手，无论用猎枪瞄准什么，都是百发百中。随后，巨人们对小伙子说，只要他肯跟着他们，就一定能得到好处的，他们还说森林外边有一大片湖泊，湖的那边耸立着一座塔楼，塔楼里关着一位漂亮的公主，他们非常想把公主抢走。“好的，”小伙子说，“我马上就去把她给你们抢过来。”接着巨人们又说：“可是还有一件事，塔里有一只小狗，只要一有人靠近，它就汪汪直叫，而它一叫，宫里的人就都醒了，所以我们根本进不去，你能不能去把那只狗射死啊？”“能，”小伙子说，“这对我来说简直是小菜一碟。”随后他上了一艘船，划到了湖对岸。刚一上岸，小狗便跑了过来张嘴要叫，这时猎人拿出气枪，将狗射死了。巨人看到这一场景，非常高兴，心里想公主这下肯定是他们的了，但是猎人却想先了解事情的究竟，于是便让巨人呆在塔外，说要等他叫他们，他们才能进来。随后，他走进城堡，里面一片寂静，大家都在睡觉。当他打开第一间屋子的门时，看到墙上挂着一把纯银制成的剑，上面还镶着一颗金星和国王的名字，旁边的桌上放着一封密封的信，他打开信一看，只见上面写着，如果谁拿到这把剑，就可以战胜一切。于是他从墙上取下剑，挂在身侧，继续向前走。随后他来到公主睡觉的房间，发现公主是那么漂亮，他屏住呼吸站在那里，一动不动地看着她。他心里想：“我怎么能将一个无辜的女孩交到野蛮而邪恶的巨人手里呢？”他继续环视，发现在床下放着一双拖鞋，右边的一只绣着她父亲的名字和一颗星星，左边的一只绣着她自己的名字和一颗星星。她还围着一条特大的镶金丝绸围巾，围巾右边绣着她父亲的名字，左边绣着她自己的名字，所有的字母都是金灿灿的。于是猎人便拿出一把剪刀，将右边的一片剪下来放到自己的背包中，然后又收起绣着国王名字的右边那只拖鞋，同样塞进了背包里。现在公主依然躺在那里熟睡着，身子全都裹在睡衣里，于是小伙子便从睡衣上剪下一小块，一并塞进背包里，但是他做这一切并没有碰公主一下。之后，他便走了，留下安然熟睡的公主，等他回到门口，三个巨人依旧站在外面等着，一心想着他会把公主带来。而他却大声叫他们进去，还说公主已经控制在他们的手中了，只是他给他们开不了门，好在门上有个洞，他们必须得钻洞进去了。于是，第一个巨人走到洞口，猎人将他的头发挽在手上，拽住他的头往里拉，接着一刀将他的头砍了下来，然后将整个身子拽了进去。他招呼第二个巨人过来，用同样的方法砍了他的头，随后又将第三个也杀了。他把美丽的公主从敌人的手中解救出来，非常开心，于是便将巨人们的舌头割下来放进了自己的背包。这时他心想：“我要回家去见父亲了，让他知道我干的这一切，之后我就去环游世界，上帝赐给我的福气一定会降临到我身上的。”</td>
		<td class="en">THERE was once a young fellow who had learnt the trade of locksmith, and told his father he would now go out into the world and seek his fortune.“Very well,” said the father, “I am quite content with that,” and gave him some money for his journey.So he travelled about and looked for work.After a time he resolved not to follow the trade of locksmith any more, for he no longer liked it, but he took a fancy for hunting.Then there met him in his rambles a huntsman dressed in green, who asked whence he came and whither he was going.The youth said he was a locksmith’s apprentice, but that the trade no longer pleased him, and he had a liking for huntsmanship, would he teach it to him?“Oh, yes,” said the huntsman, “if thou wilt go with me.”Then the young fellow went with him, bound himself to him for some years, and learnt the art of hunting.After this he wished to try his luck elsewhere, and the huntsman gave him nothing in the way of payment but an air-gun, which had, however, this property, that it hit its mark without fail whenever he shot with it.Then he set out and found himself in a very large forest, which he could not get to the end of in one day.When evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts.Towards midnight, it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance.Then he looked down through the branches towards it, and kept well in his mind where it was.But in the first place he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of the light, so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had descended.Then he got down and went to his hat, put it on again and went straight forwards.The farther he went, the larger the light grew, and when he got close to it he saw that it was an enormous fire, and that three giants were sitting by it, who had an ox on the spit, and were roasting it.Presently one of them said, “I must just taste if the meat will soon be fit to eat,” and pulled a piece off, and was about to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand.“Well, really,” said the giant, “if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand!” and helped himself to another.But when he was just about to bite into it, the huntsman again shot it away from him.On this the giant gave the one who was sitting next him a box on the ear, and cried angrily, Why art thou snatching my piece away from me?”“I have not snatched it away,” said the other, “a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee.”The giant took another piece, but could not, however, keep it in his hand, for the huntsman shot it out.Then the giant said, “That must be a good shot to shoot the bit out of one’s very mouth, such an one would be useful to us.”And he cried aloud, “Come here, thou sharpshooter, seat thyself at the fire beside us and eat thy fill, we will not hurt thee; but if thou wilt not come, and we have to bring thee by force, thou art a lost man!”On this the youth went up to them and told them he was a skilled huntsman, and that whatever he aimed at with his gun, he was certain to hit.Then they said if he would go with them he should be well treated, and they told him that outside the forest there was a great lake, behind which stood a tower, and in the tower was imprisoned a lovely princess, whom they wished very much to carry off.“Yes,” said he, “I will soon get her for you.”Then they added, “But there is still something else, there is a tiny little dog, which begins to bark directly any one goes near, and as soon as it barks every one in the royal palace wakens up, and for this reason we cannot get there; canst thou undertake to shoot it dead?”“Yes,” said he, “that will be a little bit of fun for me.”After this he got into a boat and rowed over the lake, and as soon as he landed, the little dog came running out, and was about to bark, but the huntsman took his air-gun and shot it dead.When the giants saw that, they rejoiced, and thought they already had the King’s daughter safe, but the huntsman wished first to see how matters stood, and told them that they must stay outside until he called them.Then he went into the castle, and all was perfectly quiet within, and every one was asleep.When he opened the door of the first room, a sword was hanging on the wall which was made of pure silver, and there was a golden star on it, and the name of the King, and on a table near it lay a sealed letter which he broke open, and inside it was written that whosoever had the sword could kill everything which opposed him.So he took the sword from the wall, hung it at his side and went onwards: then he entered the room where the King’s daughter was lying sleeping, and she was so beautiful that he stood still and, holding his breath, looked at her.He thought to himself, “How can I give an innocent maiden into the power of the wild giants, who have evil in their minds?”He looked about further, and under the bed stood a pair of slippers, on the right one was her father’s name with a star, and on the left her own name with a star.She wore also a great neck-kerchief of silk embroidered with gold, and on the right side was her father’s name, and on the left her own, all in golden letters.Then the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut the right corner off, and put it in his knapsack, and then he also took the right slipper with the King’s name, and thrust that in.Now the maiden still lay sleeping, and she was quite sewn into her night-dress, and he cut a morsel from this also, and thrust it in with the rest, but he did all without touching her.Then he went forth and left her lying asleep undisturbed, and when he came to the gate again, the giants were still standing outside waiting for him, and expecting that he was bringing the princess.But he cried to them that they were to come in, for the maiden was already in their power, that he could not open the gate to them, but there was a hole through which they must creep.Then the first approached, and the huntsman wound the giant’s hair round his hand, pulled the head in, and cut it off at one stroke with his sword, and then drew the rest of him in.He called to the second and cut his head off likewise, and then he killed the third also, and he was well pleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies, and he cut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack.Then thought he, “I will go home to my father and let him see what I have already done, and afterwards I will travel about the world; the luck which God is pleased to grant me will easily find me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >城堡里的国王醒来之后，发现了地上躺着三个巨人的尸体。于是他便走进女儿的房间，把叫醒她后，问她是谁杀了这三个巨人。公主回答说：“亲爱的父王，我不知道，我一直在睡觉呢。”说完便起身想穿鞋下床，谁知右脚的一只拖鞋不见了，再看看围巾，右边被剪掉了一片，最后瞅瞅自己的睡衣，居然也少了一块。国王召集了宫廷里所有的人，包括卫兵和其他在场的人，问他们是谁解救了自己的女儿，而且杀死了三个巨人。这时他手下的一个相貌丑陋的独眼将军站出来说是他干的。于是国王便说，既然他做了这么一件了不起的事，那么就把女儿嫁给他吧。但是公主却说：“亲爱的父王，要我嫁给这样一个人，我宁愿去外面流浪，哪怕是走到天涯海角。”但是国王却说，如果她不肯嫁给这个将军，那么她就必须脱去华丽的衣服，穿上贫民的粗布衣，然后离开皇宫，他还说要女儿找一个陶工，在那里学卖陶器。公主却真的脱下了她华丽的衣服，然后来到一个陶器坊，赊了一堆陶器摆起了地摊，她还向那陶工承诺说，如果天黑前她将陶器卖完了，她就把钱还给他。于是国王便命令公主到一个街角去摆摊卖陶器，他还安排了一些农民赶着车从那个摊儿上碾过去，这样所有的陶器都将变成碎片。因此，当公主在街上摆起摊儿来的时候，几辆车便驶了过来，将她的陶器全部碾成了碎片。她哭着说道：“天啊，这下我该怎么还那位陶工的钱呢？”尽管国王是想通过这种方法迫使她嫁给那位将军，她却并没有答应，而是又跑到陶工那里，问他是否能再次赊货给她。陶工说不行，要她先还清上一次的钱。随后她便回到国王那里，放声痛哭着说自己要去外边的世界流浪。这时国王说道：“我会叫人在外边的树林里给你盖一个小房子，你要一辈子都呆在里面，给所有过往的人烧饭，但是你不许收钱。”小屋盖好后，就在门上挂了个牌子，上面写着：“今日免费，明日收钱。”公主便长时间呆在那里，外边很快就传开了，说森林里住着一位姑娘，免费给路人烧饭，她的门上就这样写着呢。猎人也听说了这件事，心里想着：“对我来说，这倒是不错啊。我正穷得没饭吃呢。”于是他便拿起气枪，背起背包，包里还装着先前他从皇宫拿出来的所有证物，他来到森林里，找到了挂着牌子的小屋，牌子上果真写着：“今日免费，明日收钱。”他身上挂着曾经砍掉过三个巨人脑袋的宝剑，来到小屋里，向姑娘点了些吃的。他见到这么一位美丽的姑娘非常开心，而公主也确实长得像画上画得一样漂亮。她问猎人是从哪儿来的，要上哪儿去。猎人说：“我在周游世界。”这时公主便问他是哪儿弄来的这把宝剑，因为上面确实刻着自己父亲的名字。他却反问她是不是公主。“是的。”她回答说。“就是用这把剑，”他说，“我砍掉了三个巨人的头。”说着他便从背包里拿出他们的舌头，以示证明。随后他又给她看了那只拖鞋、那片围巾和那块睡衣。公主喜出望外，说他才是那个正真救了自己的男子。于是，他们俩一起去见老国王，把他请到小屋里来，接着公主将他带到自己的房间，告诉他猎人才是那个真正将自己从巨人手中救出来的人。老国王看了所有的证物之后，便不再怀疑了，他说知道了一切真相他很开心，而猎人也应该娶公主做妻子，听了国王的话，公主开心极了。随后，公主给猎人穿上了盛装，他看上去仿佛是他国的贵族一般。国王也吩咐人准备了宴席。大家都坐上席后，独眼将军坐在公主的左边，猎人坐在公主的右边，那将军还以为猎人是他国来访的贵族。酒宴之后，国王对独眼将军说，他要给他出题考考他。题目是：“假如有人说自己杀死了三个巨人，而当他被问起巨人的舌头哪儿去了的时候，他却说他得去看看，结果一看嘴里没有舌头，那这是怎么回事？”将军说：“那就是巨人没有舌头。”“胡说。”国王说，“凡是动物都有舌头。”接着他又问，要是有人这样回答了，那么他该当何罪。将军回答说：“应将他碎尸万段。”国王便告诉他说，他已经说出了自己的判决。将军被关进了监狱，然后被剁成了四块，而公主却嫁给了猎人。不久后，猎人接来了他的父母，两位老人和儿子一起过着幸福快乐的生活。老国王去世后，猎人便继承了王位。</td>
		<td class="en">But when the King in the castle awoke, he saw the three giants lying there dead.So he went into the sleeping-room of his daughter, awoke her, and asked who could have killed the giants?Then said she, “Dear father, I know not, I have been asleep.”But when she arose and would have put on her slippers, the right one was gone, and when she looked at her neck-kerchief it was cut, and the right corner was missing, and when she looked at her night-dress a piece was cut out of it.The King summoned his whole court together, soldiers and every one else who was there, and asked who had set his daughter at liberty, and killed the giants?Now it happened that he had a captain, who was one-eyed and a hideous man, and he said that he had done it.Then the old King said that as he had accomplished this, he should marry his daughter.But the maiden said, “Rather than marry him, dear father, I will go away into the world as far as my legs can carry me.”But the King said that if she would not marry him she should take off her royal garments and wear peasant’s clothing, and go forth, and that she should go to a potter, and begin a trade in earthen vessels.So she put off her royal apparel, and went to a potter and borrowed crockery enough for a stall, and she promised him also that if she had sold it by the evening, she would pay for it.Then the King said she was to seat herself in a corner with it and sell it, and he arranged with some peasants to drive over it with their carts, so that everything should be broken into a thousand pieces.When therefore the King’s daughter had placed her stall in the street, by came the carts, and broke all she had into tiny fragments.She began to weep and said, “Alas, how shall I ever pay for the pots now?”The King had, however, wished by this to force her to marry the captain; but instead of that, she again went to the potter, and asked him if he would lend to her once more.He said, “No,” she must first pay for the things she had already had.Then she went to her father and cried and lamented, and said she would go forth into the world.Then said he, “I will have a little hut built for thee in the forest outside, and in it thou shalt stay all thy life long and cook for every one, but thou shalt take no money for it.”When the hut was ready, a sign was hung on the door whereon was written, “To-day given, to-morrow sold.”There she remained a long time, and it was rumored about the world that a maiden was there who cooked without asking for payment, and that this was set forth on a sign outside her door.The huntsman heard it likewise, and thought to himself, “That would suit thee.Thou art poor, and hast no money.”So he took his air-gun and his knapsack, wherein all the things which he had formerly carried away with him from the castle as tokens of his truthfulness were still lying, and went into the forest, and found the hut with the sign, “To-day given, to-morrow sold.”He had put on the sword with which he had cut off the heads of the three giants, and thus entered the hut, and ordered something to eat to be given to him.He was charmed with the beautiful maiden, who was indeed as lovely as any picture.She asked him whence he came and whither he was going, and he said, “I am roaming about the world.”Then she asked him where he had got the sword, for that truly her father’s name was on it.He asked her if she were the King’s daughter.“Yes,” answered she.“With this sword,” said he, “did I cut off the heads of three giants.”And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof.Then he also showed her the slipper, and the corner of the neck-kerchief, and the bit of the night-dress.Hereupon she was overjoyed, and said that he was the one who had delivered her.On this they went together to the old King, and fetched him to the hut, and she led him into her room, and told him that the huntsman was the man who had really set her free from the giants.And when the aged King saw all the proofs of this, he could no longer doubt, and said that he was very glad he knew how everything had happened, and that the huntsman should have her to wife, on which the maiden was glad at heart.Then she dressed the huntsman as if he were a foreign lord, and the King ordered a feast to be prepared.When they went to table, the captain sat on the left side of the King’s daughter, but the huntsman was on the right, and the captain thought he was a foreign lord who had come on a visit.When they had eaten and drunk, the old King said to the captain that he would set before him something which he must guess.“Supposing any one said that he had killed the three giants and he were asked where the giants’ tongues were, and he were forced to go and look, and there were none in their heads, how could that happen?”The captain said, “Then they cannot have had any.”“Not so,” said the King.“Every animal has a tongue,” and then he likewise asked what any one would deserve who made such an answer.The captain replied, “He ought to be torn in pieces.”Then the King said he had pronounced his own sentence, and the captain was put in prison and then torn in four pieces; but the King’s daughter was married to the huntsman.After this he brought his father and mother, and they lived with their son in happiness, and after the death of the old King he received the kingdom.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Oh, indeed?” answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, “There mayst thou read what kind of a man I am!”The giant read, “Seven at one stroke,” and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow.Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it.“Do that likewise,” said the giant, “if thou hast strength?”“Is that all?” said the tailor, “that is child’s play with us!” and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.“Faith,” said he, “that was a little better, wasn’t it?”The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man.Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it.“Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise.”“Well thrown,” said the tailor, “but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all.”And he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back.“How does that shot please you, comrade?” asked the tailor.“Thou canst certainly throw,” said the giant, “but now we will see if thou art able to carry anything properly.”He took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said, “If thou art strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.”“Readily,” answered the little man; “take thou the trunk on thy shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest.”The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song, “Three tailors rode forth from the gate,” as if carrying the tree were child’s play.The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried, “Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!”The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant, “Thou art such a great fellow, and yet canst not even carry the tree!”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat.But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was hurried into the air with it.When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said, “What is this?Hast thou not strength enough to hold the weak twig?”“There is no lack of strength,” answered the little tailor.“Dost thou think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow?I leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.Jump as I did, if thou canst do it.”The giant made the attempt, but could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished him a thousand miles away.“What is to be the end of this?” they said amongst themselves.“If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him, seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against him.”They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to the King, and begged for their dismissal.“We are not prepared,” said they, “to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.”The King was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him again.But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne.He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel.He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was such a great warrior, he had one request to make to him.In a forest of his country lived two giants who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death.If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.“That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!” thought the little tailor.“One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one’s life!”“Oh, yes,” he replied, “I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小裁缝出发了，那一百名骑兵还是跟在他的身后。到达森林边缘时，他对随行的那一百名骑兵说道：“你们就在这里等着，我很快就会干掉那两个巨人。”说完他就钻进森林，四处搜寻。不一会儿他就找到了那两个巨人。他们正躺在一棵树下睡觉，鼾声如雷，树枝都被震得上下起伏。小裁缝可没闲着，他捡了满满两个口袋的石子，爬到了树上。爬到一半的时候，他顺着一个树枝滑到半空，正好坐在巨人的上方。他把石子一个接一个扔到其中一个巨人的胸口上。很长一段时间里，那个巨人都丝毫没有察觉。不过最终他还是醒了过来，推了推同伴，说：“你打我干吗？”“你是在做梦吧，”他的同伴说，“我没有打你啊！”他们又躺了下来，准备继续睡觉。小裁缝拿石子朝第二个巨人扔去。“你这是什么意思？”第二个巨人吼道，“你干吗打我？”“我没有打你。”第一个巨人吼道。他们争吵了一会儿，不过因为实在太困了，就停止了争吵，再次合上了眼睛。小裁缝又故伎重演，挑出最大的石头，用尽全力朝第一个巨人的胸部砸去。“太过分了！”第一个巨人吼道，疯了一般从地上跳起来，把同伴往树上推去，树都被震得不住地摇晃。另一个巨人立马还击，两个巨人顿时扭作一团，如同疯了一样，树都在他们的恶斗中被连根拔起。他们撕打了很长时间，最后两个巨人双双倒地而亡。这时，小裁缝才跳下树来。他自言自语：“幸亏他们没有把我藏身的这棵树连根拔起，真是走运。要不然的话，我就只有像松鼠一样跳到另外一棵树上去了。不过还好，我们这些裁缝个个都身手敏捷。”他拔出宝剑，在两个巨人的胸口上各刺了几剑，然后走出森林，找到骑兵，对他们说道：“事情办好了，我已经把那两个巨人全部干掉了，不过，还真挺不容易的呢！他们跟我对打的时候，为了活命，竟然把大树连根拔起用作防御。不过，这对我来说可起不了什么作用，我一击就能致七个毙命呢！”“难道你一点儿都没受伤吗？”骑兵问道。“你多虑啦，”小裁缝说，“他们连我一根毫毛都没伤着。”骑兵对小裁缝说的话半信半疑，就骑马进入森林查看。他们看到两个巨人倒在血泊之中，横在他们尸体旁边的正是连根拔起的大树。</td>
		<td class="en">The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers, “Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.”Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left.After a while he perceived both giants.They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down.The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree.When he was half-way up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants.For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said, “Why art thou knocking me?”“Thou must be dreaming,” said the other, “I am not knocking thee.”They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second.“What is the meaning of this?” cried the other.“Why art thou pelting me?”“I am not pelting thee,” answered the first, growling.They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more.The little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant.“That is too bad!” cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook.The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belabored each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time.Then the little tailor leapt down.“It is a lucky thing,” said he, “that they did not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to spring on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.”He drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said, “The work is done; I have given both of them their finishing stroke, but it was hard work!They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.”“But are you not wounded?” asked the horsemen.“You need not concern yourself about that,” answered the tailor, “They have not bent one hair of mine.”The horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As the second son also remained away, the youngest begged to be allowed to go forth to fetch the water, and at last the King was obliged to let him go.When he met the dwarf and the latter asked him whither he was going in such haste, he stopped, gave him an explanation, and said, “I am seeking the water of life, for my father is sick unto death.”“Dost thou know, then, where that is to be found?”“No,” said the prince.“As thou hast borne thyself as is seemly, and not haughtily like thy false brothers, I will give thee the information and tell thee how thou mayst obtain the water of life.It springs from a fountain in the courtyard of an enchanted castle, but thou wilt not be able to make thy way to it, if I do not give thee an iron wand and two small loaves of bread.Strike thrice with the wand on the iron door of the castle and it will spring open: inside lie two lions with gaping jaws, but if thou throwest a loaf to each of them, they will be quieted.Then hasten to fetch some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve, else the door will shut again, and thou wilt be imprisoned.”The prince thanked him, took the wand and the bread, and set out on his way.When he arrived, everything was as the dwarf had said.The door sprang open at the third stroke of the wand, and when he had appeased the lions with the bread, he entered the castle, and came to a large and splendid hall, wherein sat some enchanted princes whose rings he drew off their fingers.A sword and a loaf of bread were lying there, which he carried away.After this, he entered a chamber, in which was a beautiful maiden who rejoiced when she saw him, kissed him, and told him that he had delivered her, and should have the whole of her kingdom, and that if he would return in a year their wedding should be celebrated; likewise she told him where the spring of the water of life was, and that he was to hasten and draw some of it before the clock struck twelve.Then he went onwards, and at last entered a room where there was a beautiful newly-made bed, and as he was very weary, he felt inclined to rest a little.So he lay down and fell asleep.When he awoke, it was striking a quarter to twelve.He sprang up in a fright, ran to the spring, drew some water in a cup which stood near, and hastened away.But just as he was passing through the iron door, the clock struck twelve, and the door fell to with such violence that it carried away a piece of his heel.He, however, rejoicing at having obtained the water of life, went homewards, and again passed the dwarf.When the latter saw the sword and the loaf, he said, “With these thou hast won great wealth; with the sword thou canst slay whole armies, and the bread will never come to an end.”But the prince would not go home to his father without his brothers, and said, “Dear dwarf, canst thou not tell me where my two brothers are?They went out before I did in search of the water of life, and have not returned.”“They are imprisoned between two mountains,” said the dwarf.“I have condemned them to stay there, because they were so haughty.”Then the prince begged until the dwarf released them; but he warned him, however, and said, “Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.”When his brothers came, he rejoiced, and told them how things had gone with him, that he had found the water of life and had brought a cupful away with him, and had rescued a beautiful princess, who was willing to wait a year for him, and then their wedding was to be celebrated and he would obtain a great kingdom.After that they rode on together, and chanced upon a land where war and famine reigned, and the King already thought he must perish, for the scarcity was so great.Then the prince went to him and gave him the loaf, wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom, and then the prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the hosts of his enemies, and could now live in rest and peace.The prince then took back his loaf and his sword, and the three brothers rode on.But after this they entered two more countries where war and famine reigned and each time the prince gave his loaf and his sword to the Kings, and had now delivered three kingdoms, and after that they went on board a ship and sailed over the sea.During the passage, the two eldest conversed apart and said, “The youngest has found the water of life and not we, for that our father will give him the kingdom the kingdom which belongs to us, and he will rob us of all our fortune.”They then began to seek revenge, and plotted with each other to destroy him.They waited until they found him fast asleep, then they poured the water of life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, but into the cup they poured salt sea-water.Now therefore, when they arrived home, the youngest took his cup to the sick King in order that he might drink out of it, and be cured.But scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he became still worse than before.And as he was lamenting over this, the two eldest brothers came, and accused the youngest of having intended to poison him, and said that they had brought him the true water of life, and handed it to him.He had scarcely tasted it, when he felt his sickness departing, and became strong and healthy as in the days of his youth.After that they both went to the youngest, mocked him, and said, “You certainly found the water of life, but you have had the pain, and we the gain;

		<td class="en">When the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house he fell into great grief, and would gladly have had his sons back again, but no one knew whither they were gone.The eldest had apprenticed himself to a joiner, and learnt industriously and indefatigably, and when the time came for him to go travelling, his master presented him with a little table which had no particular appearance, and was made of common wood, but it had one good property; if anyone set it out, and said, “Little table, spread thyself,” the good little table was at once covered with a clean little cloth, and a plate was there, and a knife and fork beside it, and dishes with boiled meats and roasted meats, as many as there was room for, and a great glass of red wine shone so that it made the heart glad.The young journeyman thought, “With this thou hast enough for thy whole life,” and went joyously about the world and never troubled himself at all whether an inn was good or bad, or if anything was to be found in it or not.When it suited him he did not enter an inn at all, but either on the plain, in a wood, a meadow, or wherever he fancied, he took his little table off his back, set it down before him, and said, “Cover thyself,” and then everything appeared that his heart desired.At length he took it into his head to go back to his father, whose anger would now be appeased, and who would now willingly receive him with his wishing-table.It came to pass that on his way home, he came one evening to an inn which was filled with guests.They bade him welcome, and invited him to sit and eat with them, for otherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything.“No,” answered the joiner, “I will not take the few bites out of your mouths; rather than that, you shall be my guests.”They laughed, and thought he was jesting with them; he, however, placed his wooden table in the middle of the room, and said, “Little table, cover thyself.”Instantly it was covered with food, so good that the host could never have procured it, and the smell of it ascended pleasantly to the nostrils of the guests.“Fall to, dear friends,” said the joiner; and the guests when they saw that he meant it, did not need to be asked twice, but drew near, pulled out their knives and attacked it valiantly.And what surprised them the most was that when a dish became empty, a full one instantly took its place of its own accord.The innkeeper stood in one corner and watched the affair; he did not at all know what to say, but thought, “Thou couldst easily find a use for such a cook as that in thy kitchen.”The joiner and his comrades made merry until late into the night; at length they lay down to sleep, and the young apprentice also went to bed, and set his magic table against the wall.The host’s thoughts, however, let him have no rest; it occurred to him that there was a little old table in his lumber-room which looked just like the apprentice’s and he brought it out quite softly, and exchanged it for the wishing-table.Next morning, the joiner paid for his bed, took up his table, never thinking that he had got a false one, and went his way.At mid-day he reached his father, who received him with great joy.“Well, my dear son, what hast thou learnt?” said he to him.“Father, I have become a joiner.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“A good trade,” replied the old man; “but what hast thou brought back with thee from thy apprenticeship?”“Father, the best thing which I have brought back with me is this little table.”The tailor inspected it on all sides and said, “Thou didst not make a masterpiece when thou mad’st that; it is a bad old table.”“But it is a table which furnishes itself,” replied the son.“When I set it out, and tell it to cover itself, the most beautiful dishes stand on it, and a wine also, which gladdens the heart.Just invite all our relations and friends, they shall refresh and enjoy themselves for once, for the table will give them all they require.”When the company was assembled, he put his table in the middle of the room and said, “Little table, cover thyself,” but the little table did not bestir itself, and remained just as bare as any other table which did not understand language.Then the poor apprentice became aware that his table had been changed, and was ashamed at having to stand there like a liar.The relations, however, mocked him, and were forced to go home without having eaten or drunk.The father brought out his patches again, and went on tailoring, but the son went to a master in the craft.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to him.When his years were over, the master said, “As thou hast conducted thyself so well, I give thee an ass of a peculiar kind, which neither draws a cart nor carries a sack.”“To what use is he put, then?” asked the young apprentice.“He lets gold drop from his mouth,” answered the miller.“If thou settest him on a cloth and sayest ‘Bricklebrit,’ the good animal will drop gold pieces for thee.”“That is a fine thing,” said the apprentice, and thanked the master, and went out into the world.When he had need of gold, he had only to say “Bricklebrit” to his ass, and it rained gold pieces, and he had nothing to do but pick them off the ground.Wheresoever he went, the best of everything was good enough for him, and the dearer the better, for he had always a full purse.When he had looked about the world for some time, he thought, “Thou must seek out thy father; if thou goest to him with the gold-ass he will forget his anger, and receive thee well.”It came to pass that he came to the same public-house in which his brother’s table had been exchanged.He led his ass by the bridle, and the host was about to take the animal from him and tie him up, but the young apprentice said, “Don’t trouble yourself, I will take my grey horse into the stable, and tie him up myself too, for I must know where he stands.”This struck the host as odd, and he thought that a man who was forced to look after his ass himself, could not have much to spend; but when the stranger put his hand in his pocket and brought out two gold pieces, and said he was to provide something good for him, the host opened his eyes wide, and ran and sought out the best he could muster.After dinner the guest asked what he owed.The host did not see why he should not double the reckoning, and said the apprentice must give two more gold pieces.He felt in his pocket, but his gold was just at an end.“Wait an instant, sir host,” said he, “I will go and fetch some money;” but he took the table-cloth with him.The host could not imagine what this could mean, and being curious, stole after him, and as the guest bolted the stable-door, he peeped through a hole left by a knot in the wood.The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried, “Bricklebrit,” and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall, so that it fairly rained down money on the ground.“Eh, my word,” said the host, “ducats are quickly coined there!A purse like that is not amiss.”The guest paid his score, and went to bed, but in the night the host stole down into the stable, led away the master of the mint, and tied up another ass in his place.Early next morning the apprentice travelled away with his ass, and thought that he had his gold-ass.At mid-day he reached his father, who rejoiced to see him again, and gladly took him in.“What hast thou made of thyself, my son?” asked the old man.“A miller, dear father, ”he answered.“What hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels?”“Nothing else but an ass.”“There are asses enough here,” said the father, “I would rather have had a good goat.”“Yes,” replied the son, “but it is no common ass, but a gold-ass, when I say ‘Bricklebrit,’ the good beast opens its mouth and drops a whole sheetful of gold pieces.Just summon all our relations hither, and I will make them rich folks.”“That suits me well,” said the tailor, “for then I shall have no need to torment myself any longer with the needle,” and ran out himself and called the relations together.As soon as they were assembled, the miller bade them make way, spread out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room.“Now watch,” said he, and cried, “Bricklebrit,” but no gold pieces fell, and it was clear that the animal knew nothing of the art, for every ass does not attain such perfection.Then the poor miller pulled a long face, saw that he was betrayed, and begged pardon of the relatives, who went home as poor as they came.There was no help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle once more, and the youth hired himself to a miller.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A certain tailor had a son, who happened to be small, and no bigger than a Thumb, and on this account he was always called Thumbling.He had, however, some courage in him, and said to his father, “Father, I must and will go out into the world.”“That’s right, my son,” said the old man, and took a long darning-needle and made a knob of sealing-wax on it at the candle, “and there is a sword for thee to take with thee on the way.”Then the little tailor wanted to have one more meal with them, and hopped into the kitchen to see what his lady mother had cooked for the last time.It was, however, just dished up, and the dish stood on the hearth.Then he said, “Mother, what is there to eat today?”“See for thyself,” said his mother.So Thumbling jumped on to the hearth, and peeped into the dish, but as he stretched his neck in too far the steam from the food caught hold of him, and carried him up the chimney.He rode about in the air on the steam for a while, until at length he sank down to the ground again.Now the little tailor was outside in the wide world, and he travelled about, and went to a master in his craft, but the food was not good enough for him.“Mistress, if you give us no better food,” said Thumbling, “I will go away, and early tomorrow morning I will write with chalk on the door of your house, ‘Too many potatoes, too little meat! Farewell, Mr. Potato-King.’” “What wouldst thou have forsooth, grasshopper?” said the mistress, and grew angry, and seized a dishcloth, and was just going to strike him; but my little tailor crept nimbly under a thimble, peeped out from beneath it, and put his tongue out at the mistress.She took up the thimble, and wanted to get hold of him, but little Thumbling hopped into the cloth, and while the mistress was opening it out and looking for him, he got into a crevice in the table.“Ho, ho, lady mistress,” cried he, and thrust his head out, and when she began to strike him he leapt down into the drawer.At last, however, she caught him and drove him out of the house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大拇指继续自己的旅行，他来到一片大森林里，在那里碰到了一帮预谋盗窃国王财宝的强盗。他们看到小裁缝后想：“这小东西能钻进锁孔里，帮我们撬开锁。”“嘿，”其中一个盗贼大声说，“巨人歌利亚，你愿意跟我们一起去国王的宝库吗？你可以悄悄钻进去，然后把财宝抛出来。”大拇指想了一会儿，最后他说：“好。”便随同他们一起来到国王的宝库。这时大拇指将几道门上下打量了一番，想看看门上哪里有缝。不一会儿，他便看到一条足够宽的缝。于是他想马上钻进去，但是门口站岗的一个士兵发现了他，还对另一个士兵说：“看那儿一只蜘蛛在爬，好丑啊，我来把它弄死。”“还是放过这只可怜的家伙吧，”另一个士兵说，“它也不会对你有什么伤害。”于是，大拇指安全地爬过缝隙，进入宝库。他将窗户打开，窗户下面站着那几个强盗，大拇指便将银币一块一块往下扔。大拇指正干的起劲的时候，突然听到国王来检查宝库了，便马上躲到了一个隐蔽的地方。国王发现自己的几块纯银币不见了，却又想不出来到底是谁干的，因为门窗都锁得紧紧的，守卫也很森严。于是他又离开了，临走时对卫兵说：“注意点，有人在偷钱。”这时，大拇指又接着干起来，卫兵听到了宝库里的钱有动静，叮当作响。他们飞奔进去，想抓住盗贼，但小裁缝听到他们的脚步声后，便先一步跑到墙角去找了块银币藏在了下面，这样卫兵就看不到他了。这时，他开始嘲弄起卫兵，他大声喊道：“我在这儿！”卫兵循声跑过去，他们刚过去，大拇指又钻到了另一个墙角的银币下，他继续在下面喊着：“喂，我在这儿！”卫兵又急匆匆地跑了过去，而大拇指早已跑到了另一个墙角，还在那儿喊着：“喂，我在这儿！”就这样，大拇指在宝库里将卫兵玩得团团转，直到他们实在累得不行了，便走开了。于是，大拇指将银币一块一块地全部扔出了窗外。当他用尽浑身力气将最后一个搬出去时，自己也飞快地跳到上面，随着银币一起飞出了窗户。盗贼们对他大加赞扬。“你真是一条有胆的好汉。”他们说，“你愿意当我们的头儿吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">The little tailor journeyed on and came to a great forest, and there he fell in with a band of robbers who had a design to steal the King’s treasure.When they saw the little tailor, they thought, “A little fellow like that can creep through a key-hole and serve as picklock to us.”“Hollo,” cried one of them, “thou giant Goliath, wilt thou go to the treasure-chamber with us?Thou canst slip thyself in and throw out the money.”Thumbling reflected a while, and at length he said, “yes,” and went with them to the treasure-chamber.Then he looked at the doors above and below, to see if there was any crack in them.It was not long before he espied one which was broad enough to let him in.He was therefore about to get in at once, but one of the two sentries who stood before the door, observed him, and said to the other, “What an ugly spider is creeping there; I will kill it.”“Let the poor creature alone,” said the other; “it has done thee no harm.”Then Thumbling got safely through the crevice into the treasure-chamber, opened the window beneath which the robbers were standing, and threw out to them one thaler after another.When the little tailor was in the full swing of his work, he heard the King coming to inspect his treasure-chamber, and crept hastily into a hiding-place.The King noticed that several solid thalers were missing, but could not conceive who could have stolen them, for locks and bolts were in good condition, and all seemed well guarded.Then he went away again, and said to the sentries, “Be on the watch, some one is after the money.”When therefore Thumbling recommenced his labours, they heard the money moving, and a sound of klink, klink, klink.They ran swiftly in to seize the thief, but the little tailor, who heard them coming, was still swifter, and leapt into a corner and covered himself with a thaler, so that nothing could be seen of him, and at the same time he mocked the sentries and cried, “Here am I!”The sentries ran thither, but as they got there, he had already hopped into another corner under a thaler, and was crying, “Ho, ho, here am I!”The watchmen sprang there in haste, but Thumbling had long ago got into a third corner, and was crying, “Ho, ho, here am I!”And thus he made fools of them, and drove them so long round about the treasure-chamber that they were weary and went away.Then by degrees he threw all the thalers out, dispatching the last with all his might, then hopped nimbly upon it, and flew down with it through the window.The robbers paid him great compliments.“Thou art a valiant hero,” said they; “wilt thou be our captain?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而大拇指还是拒绝了，他说自己想先去外边的世界走走看看。盗贼们将战利品分了，而大拇指却只要了一块银币，因为多了他也拿不了。</td>
		<td class="en">Thumbling, however, declined, and said he wanted to see the world first.They now divided the booty, but the little tailor only asked for a kreuzer because he could not carry more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后，大拇指将剑挂在腰间，与盗贼们道别之后，便踏上了行程。起初，他在几家作坊里做学徒，但是又觉得对这些工作不感兴趣，最后来到一家旅店做仆人。可是女仆们都无法忍受他，因为大拇指总是在她们不注意的时候，将她们的秘密勾当看得一清二楚，随后他便会告诉店主夫妇，这些女仆偷吃了什么，或她们将什么东西偷偷地从地下室拿出来。女仆们说，“等着瞧，看我们怎么收拾你！”她们便一起商量着怎样戏弄一下大拇指。不久后的一天，一位女仆在花园里割草时，看到大拇指在草丛里跳来跳去，上蹿下跳，便快速地将大拇指卷进草里，然后用一块大布包好，悄悄地扔去喂牛吃了。牛群里的一头大黑牛将大拇指吞了下去，幸好并没有伤到他。然而，下到牛肚里他感觉可不好受了，里面漆黑一片，一点光都没有。等他听到有人在牛肚外挤奶的时候，便大声喊道：</td>
		<td class="en">Then he once more buckled on his sword, bade the robbers goodbye, and took to the road.First, he went to work with some masters, but he had no liking for that, and at last he hired himself as man-servant in an inn.The maids, however, could not endure him, for he saw all they did secretly, without their seeing him, and he told their master and mistress what they had taken off the plates, and carried away out of the cellar, for themselves.Then said they, “Wait, and we will pay thee off!” and arranged with each other to play him a trick.Soon afterwards when one of the maids was mowing in the garden, and saw Thumbling jumping about and creeping up and down the plants, she mowed him up quickly with the grass, tied all in a great cloth, and secretly threw it to the cows.Now amongst them there was a great black one, who swallowed him down without hurting him.Down below, however, it pleased him ill, for it was quite dark, neither was any candle burning.When the cow was being milked he cried,</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Strip, strap, strull, Will the pail soon be full?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，外边挤奶的声音太大了，挤奶的人根本就听不到大拇指的话。过了一会儿，店主来到牛栏旁，说道：“明天把这头牛宰了吧。”这时，大拇指吓坏了，便扯着嗓门喊道：“先让我出去，我还在它的肚子里呢！”店主听得清清楚楚的，可就是不知道这声音是哪儿传出来的。“你在哪儿啊？”店主问道。“在黑牛里边。”大拇指回答说，可店主并不明白他在说什么，便走开了。</td>
		<td class="en">But the noise of the milking prevented his being understood.After this the master of the house came into the cow-byre and said, “That cow shall be killed to-morrow.”Then Thumbling was so alarmed that he cried out in a clear voice, “Let me out first, for I am shut up inside her.”The master heard that quite well, but did not know from whence the voice came.“Where art thou?” asked he.“In the black one,” answered Thumbling, but the master did not understand what that meant, and went out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天早上，大黑牛被宰了。幸运的是，在切肉剁肉的过程中，一刀也没伤到大拇指，他被送到了做香肠的肉堆里。等肉贩进来要开工的时候，大拇指使尽全身力气喊道：“不要往下剁，不要往下剁，我在里面呢。”而剁刀的声音太大了，根本就没人听到他的话。可怜的大拇指这下可是遇到麻烦了，但这也往往让人急中生智。只见大拇指在剁刀的间隙中敏捷地跳来跳去，到头来整个人安然无恙。然而他还是逃不出去，无奈只能连同碎肉一起被塞进了一只黑香肠内。里面空间拥挤，而且他还被一起挂上了烟囱进行熏制，那里面的日子可真是难熬啊。</td>
		<td class="en">Next morning the cow was killed.Happily Thumbling did not meet with one blow at the cutting up and chopping; he got among the sausage-meat.And when the butcher came in and began his work, he cried out with all his might, “Don’t chop too deep, don’t chop too deep, I am amongst it.”No one heard this because of the noise of the chopping-knife.Now poor Thumbling was in trouble, but trouble sharpens the wits, and he sprang out so adroitly between the blows that none of them touched him, and he escaped with a whole skin.But still he could not get away, there was nothing for it but to let himself be thrust into a black-pudding with the bits of bacon.His quarters there were rather confined, and besides that he was hung up in the chimney to be smoked, and there time did hang terribly heavy on his hands.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于冬天到了，店主要将黑香肠取下来招待客人，大拇指也跟着下来了。女主人在切香肠时，大拇指小心地缩着头，以免脖子被切断。最后，他瞅准时机，自己钻了个洞，逃了出来。</td>
		<td class="en">At length in winter he was taken down again, as the black-pudding had to be set before a guest.When the hostess was cutting it in slices, he took care not to stretch out his head too far lest a bit of it should be cut off; at last he saw his opportunity, cleared a passage for himself, and jumped out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，小家伙害怕极了，也不想再在这儿呆下去了，于是再一次踏上了旅途。可是，没过多久他便又失去了自由。在一片旷野上，一只狐狸看到了他，便趁他不备将他一口吞下去了。“喂，狐狸先生。”大拇指大声喊道，“是我粘在你的嗓子眼里了，你就放了我吧。”“你说对了。”狐狸说道，“虽然对我来说，吃不吃你也没多大区别，但只有你发誓将你父亲院子里的鸡都给我，我才能放了你。”“我发誓，”大拇指说，“你将会得到所有的公鸡和母鸡，我向你保证。”于是，狐狸便放了大拇指，送他回家了。当老裁缝再次看到自己的儿子时，便答应将自己的鸡全都送给狐狸。“我给你一笔钱来做补偿吧。”大拇指说着将自己在路上赢到的那块银币交给了父亲。</td>
		<td class="en">The little tailor, however, would not stay any longer in a house where he fared so ill, so at once set out on his journey again.But his liberty did not last long.In the open country he met with a fox who snapped him up in a fit of absence.“Hollo, Mr. Fox,” cried the little tailor, “it is I who am sticking in your throat, set me at liberty again.”“Thou art right,” answered the fox.“Thou art next to nothing for me, but if thou wilt promise me the fowls in thy father’s yard I will let thee go.”“With all my heart,” replied Thumbling.“Thou shalt have all the cocks and hens, that I promise thee.”Then the fox let him go again, and himself carried him home.When the father once more saw his dear son, he willingly gave the fox all the fowls which he had.“For this I likewise bring thee a handsome bit of money,” said Thumbling, and gave his father the kreuzer which he earned on his travels.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and span.Then said he, “How sad it is that we have no children!With us all is so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，”妻子叹了口气回答道，“要是我们能有个孩子，哪怕他是个拇指大的小不点儿，我也会感到心满意足的，而且我们会照样全心全意地疼爱他。”不久后，妻子就感到身体不适，过了七个月后，她生下一个小孩，小孩有手有脚，完整无缺，但是却只有大拇指般大小。于是夫妻俩说：“这和我们当初期望的一样，他就是我们亲爱的宝贝。”因为孩子像大拇指一样大，于是他们就叫他“大拇指”。虽然他们给孩子吃的很好，可是孩子却不长个儿，一直都只有生下来时那么大。不过，他的眼睛非常有灵性，很快就成了一个聪明灵巧的小家伙，他干的事情样样都很棒。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” replied the wife, and sighed, “even if we had only one, and it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be quite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts.”Now it so happened that the woman fell ill, and after seven months gave birth to a child, that was perfect in all its limbs, but no longer than a thumb.Then said they, “It is as we wished it to be, and it shall be our dear child;” and because of its size, they called it Thumbling.They did not let it want for food, but the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had been at the first, nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its eyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature, for everything it did turned out well.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，农夫正准备着去树林里砍柴，他自言自语着说：“要是有人待会儿能帮我把车送来就好了！”“噢，爸爸，”大拇指大声说，“我很快就给你把车送过去，你放心吧，车子会及时到达树林的。”农夫笑了笑说：“那怎么可能啊，你那么小，怎么能够得着马儿的缰绳呢？”“没事的，爸爸，只要妈妈将马车套好，我就可以坐在马的耳朵里，大声指挥它该怎么走。”“好吧。”农夫回答说，“那我们就试一次。”</td>
		<td class="en">One day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood, when he said as if to himself, “How I wish that there was any one who would bring the cart to me!”“Oh father,” cried Thumbling, “I will soon bring the cart, rely on that; it shall be in the forest at the appointed time.”The man smiled and said, “How can that be done, thou art far too small to lead the horse by the reins?”“That’s of no consequence, father, if my mother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse’s ear and call out to him how he is to go.”“Well,” answered the man, “for once we will try it.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是马车便稳稳当当地行驶着，和平时农夫赶着时没什么差别，随后便径直驶进了树林。正当他喊着“驾－驾－”驾着马车拐弯时，走过来两个陌生人。“天哪！”其中一个人说道，“这是怎么回事？一辆马车驶过来了，有个车夫在吆喝，可是却看不到人影啊！”“是有点不对劲，”另外一个人说，“我们跟着马车去看看它停在哪里。”谁知马车径直驶进树林，刚好停在了农夫砍好的木柴边。大拇指看到父亲后便大声喊道：“你瞧，爸爸，我把马车赶过来啦，快把我放下去吧。”父亲左手拉住马，右手将大拇指从马的耳朵里取了出来。大拇指兴高采烈地坐在一棵麦秸上，而两个陌生人看到他，却惊得目瞪口呆。这时其中的一个陌生人将另外一个带到一边，对他说：“听我说，要是我们把这个小家伙带到城里去卖票展览，肯定能赚大钱的。我们把他买下来吧。”他们走到农夫跟前对他说：“把这个小人儿卖给我们吧。我们会好好待他的。”“不行，”大拇指的父亲回答说，“他是我的心肝宝贝，你就是拿全世界的钱来和我交换，我都不会卖的。”谁知大拇指听了他们的交易后，便悄悄地沿着父亲的衣褶爬到他的肩膀上，然后在的农夫耳边低声说道：“爸爸，你就把我卖给他们吧，我很快就会回来的。”于是父亲便把大拇指卖给了那两个陌生人，得了一大笔钱。“你想坐到哪里啊？”那两个人问大拇指说。“哦，把我放到你们的帽檐上吧，这样我就可以来回走动，看看乡村美景，又不会掉下去。”他们照着大拇指说的把他放上帽子，大拇指和父亲告别之后，他们便将他带走了。他们一直走到了傍晚，这时小家伙说道：“把我放下来吧，我想下来了。”陌生人摘下帽子，将大拇指放在路边，只见他跳来跳去，偷偷溜进草丛中，这时他发现有个田鼠洞，便忽地一下子就钻了进去。于是他嘲笑着向外面喊道：“晚上好，先生们，回家去吧，不用管我了。”那两个陌生人冲了过来，用小棍捅了半天田鼠洞，可也只是白费劲而已。大拇指钻到洞里去了，而天也很快就黑了，于是两人只好带着空空的钱包，怒气冲冲地回家去了。</td>
		<td class="en">Then it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart went the right way into the forest.It so happened that just as he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, “Gee up,” two strange men came towards him.“My word!” said one of them, “What is this?There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to the horse and still he is not to be seen!”“That can’t be right,” said the other, “we will follow the cart and see where it stops.”The cart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut.When Thumbling saw his father, he cried to him, “Seest thou, father, here I am with the cart; now take me down.”The father got hold of the horse with his left hand and with the right took his little son out of the ear.Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the two strange men saw him, they did not know what to say for astonishment.Then one of them took the other aside and said, “Hark, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited him in a large town, for money.We will buy him.”They went to the peasant and said, “Sell us the little man.He shall be well treated with us.”“No,” replied the father, “he is the apple of my eye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me.”Thumbling, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up the folds of his father’s coat, placed himself on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear, “Father do give me away, I will soon come back again.”Then the father parted with him to the two men for a handsome bit of money.“Where wilt thou sit?” they said to him.“Oh just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I can walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and still not fall down.”They did as he wished, and when Thumbling had taken leave of his father, they went away with him.They walked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said, “Do take me down, I want to come down.”The man took his hat off, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and he leapt and crept about a little between the sods, and then he suddenly slipped into a mouse-hole which he had sought out.“Good evening, gentlemen, just go home without me,” he cried to them, and mocked them.They ran thither and stuck their sticks into the mouse-hole, but it was all lost labour.Thumbling crept still farther in, and as it soon became quite dark, they were forced to go home with their vexation and their empty purses.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When Thumbling saw that they were gone, he crept back out of the subterranean passage.“It is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the dark,” said he; “how easily a neck or a leg is broken!”Fortunately he knocked against an empty snail-shell.“Thank God!” said he.“In that I can pass the night in safety,” and got into it.Not long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two men go by, and one of them was saying, “How shall we contrive to get hold of the rich pastor’s silver and gold?”“I could tell thee that,” cried Thumbling, interrupting them.“What was that?” said one of the thieves in fright, “I heard some one speaking.”They stood still listening, and Thumbling spoke again, and said, “Take me with you, and I’ll help you.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Thumbling had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful place to sleep in; there he intended to rest until day, and then go home again to his parents.But he had other things to go through.Truly, there is much affliction and misery in this world!When day dawned, the maid arose from her bed to feed the cows.Her first walk was into the barn, where she laid hold of an armful of hay, and precisely that very one in which poor Thumbling was lying asleep.He, however, was sleeping so soundly that he was aware of nothing, and did not awake until he was in the mouth of the cow, who had picked him up with the hay.“Ah, heavens!” cried he, “how have I got into the fulling mill?” but he soon discovered where he was.Then it was necessary to be careful not to let himself go between the teeth and be dismembered, but he was nevertheless forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay.“In this little room the windows are forgotten,” said he, “and no sun shines in, neither will a candle be brought.”His quarters were especially unpleasing to him, and the worst was, more and more hay was always coming in by the door, and the space grew less and less.Then at length in his anguish, he cried as loud as he could, “Bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder.”The maid was just milking the cow, and when she heard some one speaking, and saw no one, and perceived that it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so terrified that she slipped off her stool, and spilt the milk.She ran in great haste to her master, and said, “Oh heavens, pastor, the cow has been speaking!”“Thou art mad,” replied the pastor; but he went himself to the byre to see what was there.Hardly, however had he set his foot inside when Thumbling again cried, “Bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder.”Then the pastor himself was alarmed, and thought that an evil spirit had gone into the cow, and ordered her to be killed.She was killed, but the stomach, in which Thumbling was, was thrown on the midden.Thumbling had great difficulty in working his way; however, he succeeded so far as to get some room, but just as he was going to thrust his head out, a new misfortune occurred.A hungry wolf ran thither, and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp.Thumbling did not lose courage.“Perhaps,” thought he, “the wolf will listen to what I have got to say,” and he called to him from out of his stomach, “Dear wolf, I know of a magnificent feast for you.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在这么一所房子里，你要顺着厨房的下水道钻进去。那儿有蛋糕、咸肉、香肠等等，多得你吃都吃不完。”而大拇指描述的也正是自己的家。狼不由分说，便在夜里从下水道钻进了他家，在储物间里大吃特吃起来。等他吃饱之后，他想从下水道溜走，可是他现在的肚子这么大，根本就无法从原路出去了。大拇指早就猜到了这些，于是便开始在狼的肚子里吵闹起来，他扯起嗓子使劲地吼叫着。“你能不能安静点啊，”狼说道：“不要把屋里的人给吵醒了！”“啊，什么？”小家伙说道，“你是吃饱喝足了，我也要乐呵乐呵呀。”说着又开始极力喊叫起来。父亲、母亲终于被吵醒了，他们来到储物室，透过门缝往里看着。他们看到里面有一只狼，便转身回去，父亲拿来一把斧头，母亲拿来一把镰刀。“你跟在我后面，”父亲说道，说着他们进了屋，“我先给它一斧，如果它还没死，你就要给它一刀，将它的肚子划碎。”这时，大拇指听到了父母的声音，便大声喊道：“亲爱的爸爸，我在这儿，我在狼的肚子里。”父亲非常开心，说道：“谢天谢地，我们的宝贝儿子终于回来了。”于是他让妻子收起镰刀，以免伤到儿子。随后，他举起手中的斧头，在狼的头上狠狠地砍了一下，狼一下子就倒在地上死了。他们接着拿出剪刀，剪开狼的肚子，将大拇指拽了出来。“哎呀，”父亲说，“我们好牵挂你啊！”“是啊，爸爸，我可是闯荡了好多地方啊。谢天谢地，我终于能够透透气了！”“那么，你去了哪儿呢？”“爸爸，我去过田鼠洞，去过牛胃里，然后又跑到了狼肚子里，现在我可要呆在你们的身边了。”“我们再也不会卖你了，绝对不会了，即使把世上的珍宝都给我们，我们都不卖。”父母说着便抱起大拇指亲了他一口。他们给大拇指拿来了吃的喝的，还给他做了新衣服，因为经过这些奔波，他身上的衣服早已破烂不堪了。</td>
		<td class="en">“In such and such a house; thou must creep into it through the kitchen-sink, and wilt find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, and as much of them as thou canst eat,” and he described to him exactly his father’s house.The wolf did not require to be told this twice, squeezed himself in at night through the sink, and ate to his heart’s content in the larder.When he had eaten his fill, he wanted to go out again, but he had become so big that he could not go out by the same way.Thumbling had reckoned on this, and now began to make a violent noise in the wolf’s body, and raged and screamed as loudly as he could.“Wilt thou be quiet,” said the wolf, “thou wilt waken up the people!”“Eh, what,” replied the little fellow, “thou hast eaten thy fill, and I will make merry likewise,” and began once more to scream with all his strength.At last his father and mother were aroused by it, and ran to the room and looked in through the opening in the door.When they saw that a wolf was inside, they ran away, and the husband fetched his axe, and the wife the scythe.“Stay behind,” said the man, when they entered the room.“When I have given him a blow, if he is not killed by it, thou must cut him down and hew his body to pieces.”Then Thumbling heard his parents’ voices and cried, “Dear father, I am here; I am in the wolf’s body.”Said the father, full of joy, “Thank God, our dear child has found us again,” and bade the woman take away her scythe, that Thumbling might not be hurt with it.After that he raised his arm, and struck the wolf such a blow on his head that he fell down dead, and then they got knives and scissors and cut his body open and drew the little fellow forth.“Ah,” said the father, “what sorrow we have gone through for thy sake.”“Yes father, I have gone about the world a great deal.Thank heaven, I breathe fresh air again!”“Where hast thou been, then?”“Ah, father, I have been in a mouse’s hole, in a cow’s stomach, and then in a wolf’s; now I will stay with you.”“And we will not sell thee again, no, not for all the riches in the world,” said his parents, and they embraced and kissed their dear Thumbling.They gave him to eat and to drink, and had some new clothes made for him, for his own had been spoiled on his journey.</td></tr>
