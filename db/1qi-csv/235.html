		<td class="en">by D. H. Lawrence</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们问我：“你有没有发现出人头地很难，功成名就很难？”如果人们认为我也算出人头地，我也算功成名就，那坦白说，我并不觉得有多难。</td>
		<td class="en">They ask me: “Did you find it very hard to get on and to become a success?”And I have to admit that if I can be said to have got on, and if I can be called a success, then I did not find it hard.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我既没有蜷在阁楼上挨过饿，也没有焦躁地等待邮局送来编辑和出版商的回信，我从未使出吃奶的劲儿去写什么皇皇巨著，也未曾一觉醒来就发现自己已名声在外。</td>
		<td class="en">I never starved in a garret, nor waited in anguish for the post to bring me an answer from editor or publisher, nor did I struggle in sweat and blood to bring forth mighty works, nor did I ever wake up and find myself famous.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我是穷苦人家的孩子。在我成为作家、挣到点儿小钱、浪得些虚名之前，我本应该在险恶的环境中挣扎一番，并历经命运的重击。可我并没有经历这些。一切都那么自然而然，我不曾有过任何苦痛。</td>
		<td class="en">I was a poor boy.I ought to have wrestled in the fell clutch of circumstance, and undergone the bludgeonings of chance before I became a writer with a very modest income and a very questionable reputation.But I didn’t.It all happened by itself and without any groans from me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这似乎是个遗憾。因为我本来是出身于工人家庭的一个穷小子，前途一片渺茫。然而，看看现在的我成了什么样子？</td>
		<td class="en">It seems a pity.Because I was undoubtedly a poor boy of the working classes, with no apparent future in front of me.But after all, what am I now?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我生于工人阶级，长于工人阶级。我父亲是矿工，仅此而已，没什么好炫耀的。他甚至不值得人尊敬，因为他经常喝得酩酊大醉，对教堂唯恐避之不及，在矿上还总是在他的顶头小老板们面前粗鲁无礼。</td>
		<td class="en">I was born among the working classes and brought up among them.My father was a collier, and only a collier, nothing praiseworthy about him.He wasn’t even respectable, in so far as he got drunk rather frequently, never went near a chapel, and was usually rather rude to his little immediate bosses at the pit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他几乎从来就没分到过什么好矿坑，一直都只是个包工头，因为他总是议论矿上管事的上级，说一些惹人生厌的蠢话。他把人家全得罪了，而且几乎是故意的，这样怎么能期待人家对他有好感呢？然而人家不待见他，他便牢骚满腹。</td>
		<td class="en">He practically never had a good stall, all the time he was a butty, because he was always saying tiresome and foolish things about the men just above him in control at the mine.He offended them all, almost on purpose, so how could he expect them to favour him?Yet he grumbled when they didn’t.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我觉得母亲就比较优越。她是城里人，实际上属于资产阶级的下层。她说一口标准的英语，一点儿口音都没有。我父亲讲的方言，也就是我们这群孩子在外面讲的方言，母亲这辈子一句都模仿不来。</td>
		<td class="en">My mother was, I suppose, superior.She came from town, and belonged really to the lower bourgeoisie.She spoke King’s English, without an accent, and never in her life could even imitate a sentence of the dialect which my father spoke, and which we children spoke out of doors.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她写一手漂亮的意大利书写体，兴之所至时，还会把字写得灵巧有趣。随着年龄的增长，她又开始读小说了，不过对《彷徨中的黛安娜》这种书已完全读不下去了，《伊斯特·林恩传》也让她觉得匪夷所思。</td>
		<td class="en">She wrote a fine Italian hand, and a clever and amusing letter when she felt like it.And as she grew older she read novels again, and got terribly impatient with “Diana of the Crossways” and terribly thrilled by “East Lynne”.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可她是个工人的妻子，仅此而已，头上戴的黑帽子又小又破，下面是一张精明、平静、“与众不同”的脸。我父亲有多不受人尊敬，她就有多受人尊敬。她天性敏锐、敏感，可能也确实比常人优越些。但是她沦落了，落到了工人阶级中，和更加穷困的矿工妻子们为伍。</td>
		<td class="en">But she was a working man’s wife, and nothing else, in her shabby little black bonnet, and her shrewd, clear, “different” face.And she was very much respected, just as my father was not respected.Her nature was quick and sensitive, and perhaps really superior.But she was down, right down in the working class, among the mass of poorer colliers’ wives.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我当时还是个瘦弱的小毛孩，面色苍白，长着令人讨厌的鼻子。人们大多把我当成一个普普通通的瘦弱小孩，待我还不错。12岁时，我拿到郡议会的奖学金，一年12英镑，由此得以进入诺丁汉高中学习。</td>
		<td class="en">I was a delicate, pale brat with a snuffy nose, whom most people treated quite gently as just an ordinary delicate little lad.When I was twelve I got a county council scholarship, twelve pounds a year, and went to Nottingham High School.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >离开学校后，我成为一名职员。可三个月后，我患上了严重的肺炎。这病毁了我一生的健康，而我当时不过17岁。</td>
		<td class="en">After leaving school I was a clerk for three months, then had a very serious pneumonia illness, in my seventeenth year, that damaged my health for life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一年后，我谋得一份教师的工作。辛辛苦苦地教了矿工子弟们三年后，我进入诺丁汉大学学习“正规”课程。</td>
		<td class="en">A year later I became a school teacher and after three years’ savage teaching of collier lads I went to take the “normal” course in Nottingham University.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我先前脱离教职时很高兴，后来离开大学时也很高兴。上大学仅仅意味着幻灭，并不是人与人之间活生生的联系。从大学出来，我南下到伦敦附近的克罗伊登，到一所新建的小学里教书，年薪100英镑。</td>
		<td class="en">As I was glad to leave school, I was glad to leave college.It had meant mere disillusion, instead of the living contact of men.From college I went down to Croydon, near London, to teach in a new elementary school at a hundred pounds a year.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在克罗伊登，我23岁那年，一个女孩子把我的几首诗誊抄出来，在没告诉我的情况下就寄给了《英国评论》，这份杂志刚刚在福特·马多克斯·惠弗的带领下获得辉煌重生。那女孩是我家乡一所矿工子弟学校的一名老师，是我小时候的好友。</td>
		<td class="en">It was while I was at Croydon, when I was twenty-three, that the girl who had been the chief friend of my youth, and who was herself a school teacher in a mining village at home, copied out some of my poems, and without telling me sent them to the “English Review”, which had just had a glorious re-birth under Ford Madox Hueffer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >惠弗极其和善。他把那些诗印出来，并让我去见他。那个女孩就这么轻而易举地开启了我的文学生涯，就像一个公主断开船上的缆绳、让轮船起航一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Hueffer was most kind.He printed the poems, and asked me to come and see him.The girl had launched me, so easily, on my literary career, like a princess cutting a thread, launching a ship.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛辛苦苦四年，我终于从意识深处写出了《白孔雀》的初稿。对于这部书稿的大部分，我写过五六遍，不过是断断续续写的。我并没有把这看成是一项任务或神圣的使命，也没有经历分娩般的痛苦。</td>
		<td class="en">I had been tussling away for four years, getting out “The White Peacock” in inchoate bits, from the underground of my consciousness.I must have written most of it five of six times, but only in intervals, never as a task or a divine labour, or in the groans of parturition.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我经常猛写一阵，写了一点儿就让那女孩看。她总是赞不绝口。随后我又会感觉不是我想要的，于是就再猛写一阵。不过，在克罗伊登的时候，我白天上课，晚上写作，很有规律。</td>
		<td class="en">I would dash at it, do a bit, show it to the girl; she always admired it; then realise afterwards it wasn’t what I wanted, and have another dash.But at Croydon I had worked at it fairly steadily, in the evenings after school.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不管怎么说，经过四五年断断续续的努力，书算是写完了。惠弗迫不及待地就要看手稿。他立即读了一遍，读的时候非常和善，神情愉悦，还带着一种煞有介事的姿态。当时我们在伦敦的公交车上，他以古怪的声调冲着我的耳朵喊道：“英语小说里能犯的错误你都犯啦。”</td>
		<td class="en">Anyhow, it was done, after four or five years’ spasmodic effort.Hueffer asked at once to see the manuscript.He read it immediately, with the greatest cheery sort of kindness and bluff.And in his queer voice, when we were in an omnibus in London, he shouted in my ear: “It’s got every fault that the English novel can have.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那时候，比起法语小说，英语小说被认为错误百出，几乎没有立足之地。“不过，”惠弗在车上大喊，“你很有天分。”</td>
		<td class="en">Just then the English novel was supposed to have so many faults, in comparison with the French, that it was hardly allowed to exist at all.“But,” shouted Hueffer in the bus, “you’ve got GENIUS.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这让我觉得很好笑，听起来那么滑稽。头几年，他们总是说我有天分，好像是因为我没有他们身上那些举世无双的优点而安慰我似的。</td>
		<td class="en">This made me want to laugh; it sounded so comical.In the early days, they were always telling me I had got genius, as if to console me for not having their own incomparable advantages.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但惠弗不是那个意思。我一直认为他也是有些天分的。无论如何，他把《白孔雀》的手稿寄给了威廉·海涅曼。海涅曼立刻接受了书稿，只让我改了四行字。现在无论谁看到省掉的那四行字，都准会会心一笑。书稿出版后，我可以得到50美元的稿酬。</td>
		<td class="en">But Hueffer didn’t mean that.I always thought he had a bit of genius himself.Anyhow, he sent the M.S. of “The White Peacock” to William Heinemann, who accepted it at once, and made me alter only four little lines whose omission would now make anybody smile.I was to have $50 when the book was published.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同时，惠弗还在《英国评论》上印发了我更多的诗，还有我写的一些故事，这是人们读到后告诉我的，我有些尴尬，也有些气愤。我不愿意成为人们眼里的作家。尤其因为我那时是一名教师。</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile Hueffer printed more poems and some stories of mine in the “English Review”, and people read them and told me so, to my embarrassment and anger.I hated being an author, in people’s eyes.Especially as I was a teacher.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我25岁时，母亲去世了。两个月后，《白孔雀》出版，但这对我而言没什么意义。我继续教我的书。一年后，严重的肺病再次袭击了我。病好些后，我没回学校。从那以后，我就靠微薄的稿酬度日。</td>
		<td class="en">When I was twenty-five my mother died, and two months later “The White Peacock” was published, but it meant nothing to me.I went on teaching for another year, and then again a bad pneumonia illness intervened.When I got better I did not go back to school.I lived hence-forward on my scanty literary earnings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从我放弃教职、完全靠笔杆子谋生已经有17年了。期间，我没有挨过饿，也没有感受过贫困的滋味，尽管前十年的收入经常赶不上我继续当小学老师的收入。</td>
		<td class="en">It is 17 years since I gave up teaching and started to live an independent life of the pen.I have never starved, and never even felt poor, though my income for the first ten years was no better, and often worse, than it would have been if I had remained an elementary school-teacher.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，人要是生下来就穷，那么一丁点儿钱就够用了。不敢说别人，至少我父亲会觉得我现在很富裕。而母亲会认为我在这世上的地位提高了，尽管我不这么认为。</td>
		<td class="en">But when one has been born poor a very little money can be enough.Now my father would think I am rich, if nobody else does.And my mother would think I have risen in the world, even if I don’t think so.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但有些地方出了问题，或者是我，或者是这个世界，抑或是我们都出了问题。我去过很远的地方，见过各种各样、处于各种处境的人，也遇到过我真正喜欢和敬重的人。</td>
		<td class="en">But something is wrong, either with me or with the world, or with both of us.I have gone far and met many people, of all sorts and all conditions, and man whom I have genuinely liked and esteemed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们当面接触时基本上都很友好。我们就不说评论家了，他们是不同于人类的另类动物。我也曾一度想跟一些人成为真正的朋友，至少和我的一些同胞们吧。</td>
		<td class="en">People, personally, have nearly always been friendly.Of critics we will not speak, they are different fauna from people.And I have wanted to feel truly friends with some, at least, of my fellow-men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过我从未成功过。我不确定在这个世上我是否算出人头地，但我肯定我和这个世界相处得不怎么好。我真的不知道自己是否算得上是世俗意义上的成功人士。可不知为什么，我总感觉自己算不上人类中的成功者。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet I have never quite succeeded.Whether I get on in the world is a question; but I certainly don’t get on very well with the world.And whether I am a worldly success or not I don’t really know.But I feel, somehow, not much of a human success.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我是说我感觉不到自己和社会之间或者自己和其他人之间有什么友好而根本的联系。我们之间有一条鸿沟。跟我有联系的是种非人类的、不可言说的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">By which I mean that I don’t feel there is any very cordial or fundamental contact between me and society, or me and other people.There is a breach.And my contact is with something that is non-human, non-vocal.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之前，我总认为这跟欧洲的老朽和破旧有关。去过其他地方之后，我知道不是这样。欧洲可能是所有大洲中最不破旧的，因为欧洲是居住人口最多的地方。那是一个充满生气的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">I used to think it had something to do with the oldness and worn-outness of Europe.Having tried other places, I know that is not so.Europe is, perhaps, the least worn-out of the continents, because it is the most lived in.A place that is lived in lives.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从美国回来后，我很严肃地问自己：为什么自己和认识的人之间联系那么少？那联系为什么没有实际意义？</td>
		<td class="en">It is since coming back from America that I ask myself seriously: Why is there so little contact between myself and the people whom I know?Why has the contact no vital meaning?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果我把这个问题写下来，并尝试把答案也写下来，那是因为我认为这个问题困扰着许多人。</td>
		<td class="en">And if I write the question down, and try to write the answer down, it is because I feel it is a question that troubles many men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我看来，答案与阶级有关。阶级造成了鸿沟，人类最顺畅的流动被这个鸿沟中断了。确切地说，使之夭折的不是中产阶级的胜利，而是与中产阶级有关的事物的胜利。</td>
		<td class="en">The answer, as far as I can see, has something to do with class.Class makes a gulf, across which all the best human flow is lost.It is not exactly the triumph of the middle-classes that has made the deadness, but the triumph of the middle-class thing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >作为一个来自工人阶级的人，我感觉跟中产阶级在一起时，我生命的一些律动会被他们切断。我承认他们通常很有魅力，有教养，也很和善。但是他们确实使我身体里的一部分停止了运转。而那部分注定要被忽视。</td>
		<td class="en">As a man from the working-class, I feel that the middle-class cut off some of my vital vibration when I am with them.I admit them charming and educated and good people often enough.But they just stop some part of me from working.Some part has to be left out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那我为什么不跟工人阶级在一起生活呢？因为他们的律动局限在另一个方向。他们视野狭窄却又相当深刻、饱含热情；而中产阶级视野虽广却肤浅、缺乏热情。相当缺乏热情。他们最多是用爱情来代替，这也是中产阶级最积极的情感了。</td>
		<td class="en">Then why don’t I live with my working people?Because their vibration is limited in another direction.They are narrow, but still fairly deep and passionate, whereas the middle-class is broad and shallow and passionless.Quite passionless.At the best they substitute affection, which is the great middle-class positive emotion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过工人阶级在观点、成见和智力上显得都很狭隘。这又会造成禁锢。一个人不可能绝对地属于哪个阶级。</td>
		<td class="en">But the working-class is narrow in outlook, in prejudice, and narrow in intelligence.This again makes a prison.One can belong absolutely to no class.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，举个例子来说，我现在在意大利，跟这个大宅院里劳作的农民住一块儿，保持着一种静默的联系。我跟他们并不热络，除了见面打个招呼，几乎很少跟他们说话。他们不是给我干活，我不是他们的雇主。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet I find, here in Italy, for example, that I live in a certain silent contact with the peasants who work the land of this villa.I am not intimate with them, hardly speak to them save to say good-day.And they are not working for me; I am not their padrone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可正是他们真正形成了我周围的环境，也是通过他们，人类的情感流动才得以到达我这里。我不想跟他们一起住在小屋里，那是一种禁锢。但我希望他们在那儿，在附近，希望他们的生活跟我的生活一起前进，跟我的生活有所关联。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet it is they, really, who form my ambiente, and it is from them that the human flow comes to me.I don’t want to live with them in their cottages; that would be a sort of prison.But I want them to be there, about the place, their lives going along with mine, and in relation to mine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我没有将他们理想化。这种愚蠢的做法我早受够了！这比让学童自己找词表述自己的想法还要愚蠢。我并不指望他们能在这地球上创造出什么太平盛世，现在不指望，将来也不指望。可是我想住在他们附近，因为他们的生命还在流动。</td>
		<td class="en">I don’t idealise them.Enough of that folly!It is worse than setting schoolchildren to express themselves in self-conscious twaddle.I don’t expect them to make any millennium here on earth, neither now nor in the future.But I want to live near them, because their life still flows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，我差不多明白自己为什么连巴里和韦尔斯的步伐都跟不上，他俩也是普通人，都取得了巨大的成功。现在我明白自己为什么不能在这世上出人头地，变得哪怕只有一点点出名或富有了。</td>
		<td class="en">And now I know, more or less, why I cannot follow in the footsteps even of Barrie or of Wells, who both came from the common people also and are both such a success.Now I know why I cannot rise in the world and become even a little popular and rich.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为我不能成功地从自己的阶级转到中产阶级。因为我不能为世界上的任何事情而放弃自己意识中的热情，以及自己跟同一个阶级的人、动物，还有土地之间的那种原始的血缘关系，而去寻求其他干瘪、虚假的狂妄自大。这种自大的情绪一旦唯我独尊起来，就会成为心理意识中仅剩的情绪了。</td>
		<td class="en">I cannot make the transfer from my own class into the middle-class.I cannot, not for anything in the world, forfeit my passional consciousness and my old blood-affinity with my fellow-men and the animals and the land, for that other thin, spurious mental conceit which is all that is left of the mental consciousness once it has made itself exclusive.</td></tr>
