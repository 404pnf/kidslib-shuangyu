"二十年后","AFTER TWENTY YEARS"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"巡逻的警察威风凛凛地沿着大街走来。这种威风并非做秀,而是习惯，因为旁观者无几。这时不到夜里十点，但寒风阵阵，夹着雨意，街上被风吹得几乎已经没有什么行人了。","The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively.The impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few.The time was barely 10 o’clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh de-peopled the streets."
"他身形健壮，走路有点大摇大摆，一路走来一面试试各家的门是否锁好，一面把警棍舞出种种复杂巧妙的花样，不时还警惕地往平静的大道望上一眼，俨然是和平的守护神。附近的居民早睡早起。偶尔还可以看到一家香烟商店或一家通宵便餐馆的灯光；但大部分商家的门早关了。","Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace.The vicinity was one that kept early hours.Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed."
"巡逻到某街区差不多一半时，警察突然放慢了步子。在一家黑漆漆的五金店门口，有个男子倚墙而战，嘴上叼着一支还没点上的雪茄。见警察走近，男人马上开口了。","When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk.In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth.As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly."
"“没事儿，警官，”他的语气让人很是放心，“我只是在等一个朋友。这是二十年前定下的约定。你听了也许感觉有点好笑，是不是？如果你想弄清楚，我可以向你解释。大约二十年前，这家店面所在的地方原是一家餐馆——‘大乔’布雷迪的餐馆。”","“It’s all right, officer,” he said, reassuringly.“I’m just waiting for a friend.It’s an appointment made twenty years ago.Sounds a little funny to you, doesn’t it?Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make certain it’s all straight.About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands—‘Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”"
"“直到五年前，”警察说，“它才被拆掉。”","“Until five years ago,” said the policeman.“It was torn down then.”"
"门口的男人擦了一根火柴点燃雪茄。那火光照出一张方下巴的苍白脸庞，目光炯炯，右眉梢边有道白色小疤。他的领带别针上有颗大钻石，镶得很奇怪。","The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar.The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow.His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set."
"“二十年前的今晚,”那人说，“我在这儿的‘大乔’布雷迪餐馆和杰米·韦尔斯吃饭。他是我最好的朋友，也是世上最好的人。我们情同手足，一起在纽约长大。当时我十八岁，杰米二十岁。第二天早晨我就要动身去西部闯天下。你简直没法儿把他拽离纽约；他当时认为纽约是世上最好的地方。于是那晚我们决定二十年后的同一天同一时刻，还在这儿会面，不管我们的境况如何，不管要从多远的地方赶来。我们认为无论这二十年过得如何，二十年后各自的命运应该定了，也有个好前程了。","“Twenty years ago to-night,” said the man, “I dined here at ‘Big Joe’ Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world.He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together.I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty.The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune.You couldn’t have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth.Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come.We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be.”"
"“听上去挺有意思，”警察说，“尽管在我看来这会面时间隔得久远了些。你离开以后有没有你朋友的消息？”","“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the policeman.“Rather a long time between meets, though, it seems to me.Haven’t you heard from your friend since you left?”"
"“嗯，有，有一阵子我们互通音讯，”那人说，“但过了一两年，我们就失去了联系。你瞧，西部可是个大地方，我在那儿东奔西走，忙碌得很。但我知道只要杰米还活着，他一定会来这儿见我,他一直是世上最真诚、最忠实的老朋友。他绝不会忘记的。我走了一千英里，今晚才站在这门口，只要我的老伙伴露面，这就值得。”","“Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,” said the other.“But after a year or two we lost track of each other.You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively.But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world.He’ll never forget.I came a thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it’s worth it if my old partner turns up.”"
"等待朋友的那人掏出一块漂亮的怀表，表盖上镶着些小粒钻石。","The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds."
"“差三分十点，”他宣布，“我们当时在餐馆门口分别的时候是十点整。”","“Three minutes to ten,” he announced.“It was exactly ten o’clock when we parted here at the restaurant door.”"
"“你在西部混得不错，是吧？”警察问道。","“Did pretty well out West, didn’t you?” asked the policeman."
"“你说对了！我希望杰米能抵到我的一半。他虽然是个好人，但太老实了。我得同最精明的人竞争才能发财。一个人在纽约可以墨守成规。到了西部就得精明起来。”","“You bet!I hope Jimmy has done half as well.He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was.I’ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile.A man gets in a groove in New York.It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.”"
"警察挥着警棍，走开一两步。","The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two."
"“我要走了。希望你的朋友终会来。他到点不来你是不是就不等了？”","“I’ll be on my way.Hope your friend comes around all right.Going to call time on him sharp?”"
"“当然不会！”那人说，“我至少会再等他半个小时。如果杰米还在世的话,那时他准来了。再见，警官。”","“I should say not!” said the other.“I’ll give him half an hour at least.If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time.So long, officer.”"
"“晚安，先生。”警察说，一路继续巡逻，一边察看门是否锁好。","“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went."
"这时下起了毛毛细雨，冰冷刺骨，风也不再是一阵一阵的，而是一个劲儿刮着。在这一带出现的几个行人静默沉闷地赶着路，外衣领子翻得高高的，双手插在口袋里。而在五金店门口的那个人，他赶了一千英里的路来践一个与年轻时代的朋友定下的约，一个不可靠得近乎荒谬的约，抽着雪茄等待着。","There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow.The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands.And in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited."
"他等了约莫二十分钟后，一个穿长外套、领子翻到耳边的高个子男子急匆匆从对街穿过来。他径直走向等待着的人。","About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side of the street.He went directly to the waiting man."
"“是你吗，鲍勃？”他犹豫地问。","“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully."
"“是你吗，杰米·韦尔斯？”门口的人嚷道。","“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door."
"“哎呀！”刚到的人握住对方的双手。“是鲍勃，千真万确。我相信只要你还活着，我一定能在这儿找着你。好啊，好啊，好啊！——二十年可是一段很长的时间啊。老餐馆已经不在了，鲍勃；我希望它还在，这样我们能在这儿再吃顿饭。西部待你怎么样，老朋友？”","“Bless my heart!” exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other’s hands with his own.“It’s Bob, sure as fate.I was certain I’d find you here if you were still in existence.Well, well, well!—twenty years is a long time.The old restaurant’s gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we could have had another dinner there.How has the West treated you, old man?”"
"“非常好；西部给了我所要的一切。你的变化很大，杰米。我从没想过你竟比以前高了两三英寸。”","“Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for.You’ve changed lots, Jimmy.I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches.”"
"“噢，我二十岁以后又长高了些。”","“Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.”"
"“在纽约过得不错吧，杰米？”","“Doing well in New York, Jimmy?”"
"“还行。我在市里一个部门有份工作。来吧，鲍勃；我们去一个我认识的地方，好好叙叙旧。”","“Moderately.I have a position in one of the city departments.Come on, Bob; we’ll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk about old times.”"
"两个男人手挽手地沿街走去。西部来的男人因成功而自高自大，开始讲述他事业的发展史。另一个人将自己紧紧地裹在大衣里，听得津津有味。","The two men started up the street, arm in arm.The man from the West, his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history of his career.The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest."
"街角有一家杂货铺，灯光明亮。当他们走到这亮处，同时转身看向对方的脸。","At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights.When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other’s face."
"西部来的男人突然止步，抽出手臂。","The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm."
"“你不是杰米·韦尔斯，”他厉声说，“二十年确实很长，但不至于长到让一个人的高鼻梁塌成扁鼻梁。”","“You’re not Jimmy Wells,” he snapped.“Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man’s nose from a Roman to a pug.”"
"“有时二十年却能让一个好人变成坏人，”高个子男人说，“你已经被捕十分钟了，‘泥鳅’鲍勃。芝加哥警方认为你可能会顺道经过我们这儿，来电报说想和你谈一谈。老实点儿，好吗？那样才明智。现在，趁我们到警察局前，我这儿有张别人托我转交给你的便条。你可以就着窗口的灯光看看。这是韦尔斯巡警给你的。”","“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,” said the tall man.“You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob.Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you.Going quietly, are you?That’s sensible.Now, before we go on to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you.You may read it here at the window.It’s from Patrolman Wells.”"
"西部来的人打开交给他的小纸片。他开始看时手是稳的，可看完后不禁微微抖了。那便条相当短。","The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him.His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished.The note was rather short."
"鲍勃：我按时到了约定的地点。当你擦火柴点雪茄时，我发现你就是芝加哥警方通缉的人。无论如何，我无法亲自下手，只得走开，找了一个便衣代劳。杰米。","Bob: I was at the appointed place on time.When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago.Somehow I couldn’t do it myself, so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job.                                                                           JIMMY."
