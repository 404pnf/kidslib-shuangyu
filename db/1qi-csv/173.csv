"杀人","To Kill a Man"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"尽管夜明灯发出微弱的光，她还是熟悉地穿过大大的房间和宽敞的走廊，徒劳地寻找她写到一半的诗歌集子，她之前不知道随手放哪儿了，现在刚刚想起来找。她打开客厅的灯，灯光下可以看到她身穿一件拖曳的长睡衣；睡衣是柔和的玫瑰色，颈前和两肩处的蕾丝让她透不过气来。她的戒指还戴在手指上，扎上去的一头黄发还没有披散下来。她清秀优雅，十分美丽，细长的鹅蛋脸上有两片朱唇，脸颊上泛着淡淡的红晕。一双蓝眼睛像变色龙一样随意变化，有时瞪得大大的，充满了孩童的无邪，有时变得锐利灰暗，闪耀着冷峻的目光，在狂热、固执和掌控一切时，目光还会变得如烈焰般火红。","Though dim night-lights burned, she moved familiarly through the big rooms and wide halls, seeking vainly the half-finished book of verse she had mislaid and only now remembered.When she turned on the lights in the drawing-room, she disclosed herself clad in a sweeping negligee gown of soft rose-colored stuff, throat and shoulders smothered in lace.Her rings were still on her fingers, her massed yellow hair had not yet been taken down.She was delicately, gracefully beautiful, with slender, oval face, red lips, a faint color in the cheeks, and blue eyes of the chameleon sort that at will stare wide with the innocence of childhood, go hard and gray and brilliantly cold, or flame up in hot wilfulness and mastery."
"她关上灯，走出房间，沿着走廊向晨室走去。走到门口，她停住脚步留神听了听。远处有声音传来，但不是喧闹声，像是有人在活动。她本来可以确信自己什么都没听到，但这次有些不寻常之处。夜晚宁静的气氛被扰乱了。她在想是哪个仆人在鬼鬼祟祟地来回走动。不是那个男管家，众所周知，除了特殊的场合，他总是老早就睡了。也不可能是她的女仆，她已经批准女仆当晚外出了。","She turned the lights off and passed out and down the hall toward the morning room.At the entrance she paused and listened.From farther on had come, not a noise, but an impression of movement.She could have sworn she had not heard anything, yet something had been different.The atmosphere of night quietude had been disturbed.She wondered what servant could be prowling about.Not the butler, who was notorious for retiring early save on special occasion.Nor could it be her maid, whom she had permitted to go that evening."
"她继续往餐厅走去，发现门锁着。她不知道自己为什么要打开门继续往里走，只是感觉那扰人的东西就在那儿，不管是什么。房间里一片漆黑，她摸索着找到了灯开关，按了下去。一道强光闪过，她后退了几步，大叫了一声。只是一声“哦！”，声音不大。","Passing on to the dining-room, she found the door closed.Why she opened it and went on in, she did not know, except for the feeling that the disturbing factor, whatever it might be, was there.The room was in darkness, and she felt her way to the button and pressed.As the blaze of light flashed on, she stepped back and cried out.It was a mere “Oh!” and it was not loud."
"在她面前，开关旁边，有个男人正贴墙站着。他手里拿着一把左轮手枪，指向她。尽管还处于看到他的震惊之中，她还是注意到这把枪是黑色的，并且枪筒非常长。她知道黑色和非常长的枪筒代表着什么，这是把柯尔特枪。他是个身材中等的男子，穿着粗陋；眼睛是棕色的，皮肤被太阳晒得黝黑。他看上去非常镇静。左轮手枪没有丝毫晃动，正指向她的腹部，不过不是从伸出手臂的方向，而是从胯骨那儿，他的前臂就抵在那里。","Facing her, alongside the button, flat against the wall, was a man.In his hand, pointed toward her, was a revolver.She noticed, even in the shock of seeing him, that the weapon was black and exceedingly long-barreled.She knew black and exceedingly long it for what it was, a Colt’s.He was a medium-sized man, roughly clad, brown-eyed, and swarthy with sunburn.He seemed very cool.There was no wabble to the revolver and it was directed toward her stomach, not from an outstretched arm, but from the hip, against which the forearm rested."
"“哦，”她说，“请见谅，你吓到我了。你想要什么？”","“Oh,” she said.“I beg your pardon.You startled me.What do you want?”"
"“我想要出去，”他回答说，嘴唇滑稽地抽动了一下，“我在这屋子里有点儿迷路了，你要是好心告诉我门在哪儿，我就不惹什么麻烦，保证马上走人。”","“I reckon I want to get out,” he answered, with a humorous twitch to the lips.“I’ve kind of lost my way in this here shebang, and if you’ll kindly show me the door I’ll cause no trouble and sure vamoose.”"
"“但是，你在这儿做什么？”她质问道，她的嗓音略带些权威人士惯有的尖厉。","“But what are you doing here?” she demanded, her voice touched with the sharpness of one used to authority."
"“只是抢劫，小姐，仅此而已。我来窥探看看能搜罗到什么。我以为你不会回家了，因为我看见你开车和你家老头子出去了。我猜那肯定是你父亲，而你就是赛特利夫小姐。”","“Plain robbing, Miss, that’s all.I came snooping around to see what I could gather up.I thought you wan’t to home, seein’ as I saw you pull out with your old man in an auto.I reckon that must a ben your pa, and you’re Miss Setliffe.”"
"赛特利夫夫人意识到他的错误，却很感激他这缺乏判断力的恭维，于是决定不让他知道真相。","Mrs. Setliffe saw his mistake, appreciated the naive compliment, and decided not to undeceive him."
"“你怎么知道我是赛特利夫小姐？”她问道。","“How do you know I am Miss Setliffe?” she asked."
"“这是老赛特利夫的房子，不是吗？”","“This is old Setliffe’s house, ain’t it?”"
"她点点头。","She nodded."
"“我以前不知道他有个女儿，但我猜你就是她了。那么，如果不太麻烦的话，你要是能给我指指出去的路我会感激不尽的。”","“I didn’t know he had a daughter, but I reckon you must be her.And now, if it ain’t botherin’ you too much, I’d sure be obliged if you’d show me the way out.”"
"“可我为什么要这么做？你是个强盗，是个窃贼。”","“But why should I?You are a robber, a burglar.”"
"“如果我不是个干这事的普通新手，现在我就在一个个地摘你手指上的戒指了，而不会这样客气。”他反驳说。","“If I wan’t an ornery shorthorn at the business, I’d be accumulatin’ them rings on your fingers instead of being polite,” he retorted."
"“我来是想从老赛特利夫捞一笔的，不是来抢劫女士的。你要是让开，我想我能找到出去的路。”","“I come to make a raise outa old Setliffe, and not to be robbing women-folks.If you get outa the way, I reckon I can find my own way out.”"
"赛特利夫夫人是个敏锐的女人，她感觉这样一个人没什么可怕的。她确定他不是典型的罪犯。从他的说法方式上她了解到他不是城里人，而且她似乎感觉到了大空间的那种更广阔和朴实的气息。","Mrs. Setliffe was a keen woman, and she felt that from such a man there was little to fear.That he was not a typical criminal, she was certain.From his speech she knew he was not of the cities, and she seemed to sense the wider, homelier air of large spaces."
"“假设我刚才尖叫了呢？”她好奇地问，“要是我刚才大叫着求救呢？你也不会对我开枪吗？……一个女人？”","“Suppose I screamed?” she queried curiously.“Suppose I made an outcry for help?You couldn’t shoot me?…a woman?”"
"她注意到他棕色的眼睛里闪过一丝困惑。他沉思着慢慢回答，好像在解答一道难题，“我想，那么，我会掐住你的脖子，粗鲁地对待你。”","She noted the fleeting bafflement in his brown eyes.He answered slowly and thoughtfully, as if working out a difficult problem.“I reckon, then, I’d have to choke you and maul you some bad.”"
"“一个女人？”","“A woman?”"
"“我确定我是不得不这样做。”他回答道，她看见他嘴巴坚决冷酷的样子。","“I’d sure have to,” he answered, and she saw his mouth set grimly."
"“你只是一个柔弱的女人，可你看，小姐，我可蹲不起监狱。是的，小姐，我确定我蹲不起监狱。有个朋友在西部等我。他正身处困境，而我得帮他脱离困境。”他嘴巴的样子更加坚决冷酷。“我想我会掐住你的脖子，但不会让你受什么大的伤害。”","“You’re only a soft woman, but you see, Miss, I can’t afford to go to jail.No, Miss, I sure can’t.There’s a friend of mine waitin’ for me out West.He’s in a hole, and I’ve got to help him out.”The mouth shaped even more grimly.“I guess I could choke you without hurting you much to speak of.”"
"她望着他，眼神就像个婴儿一样，带着一种天真的怀疑。","Her eyes took on a baby stare of innocent incredulity as she watched him."
"“我以前从没遇到过窃贼，”她向他保证说，“我不知该如何告诉你我有多感兴趣。”","“I never met a burglar before,” she assured him, “and I can’t begin to tell you how interested I am.”"
"“我不是个窃贼，小姐，不是个真正的窃贼。”他赶紧补充说，因为她似乎觉得很好笑，一脸怀疑的表情。“看上去是这样，我在你的房子里。但这是我第一次干这种事。我非常需要那笔钱。而且，这对我来说也就是搜罗属于我的东西。”","“I’m not a burglar, Miss.Not a real one,” he hastened to add as she looked her amused unbelief.“It looks like it, me being here in your house.But it’s the first time I ever tackled such a job.I needed the money bad.Besides, I kind of look on it like collecting what’s coming to me.”"
"“我不懂，”她鼓励地笑着说道，“你来这儿抢劫，而抢劫就是要带走不属于你的东西。”","“I don’t understand,” she smiled encouragingly.“You came here to rob, and to rob is to take what is not yours.”"
"“在这种特殊情况下，是这样、也不是这样的。但我想我现在最好离开。”","“Yes, and no, in this here particular case.But I reckon I’d better be going now.”"
"他动身走向餐厅的门，可她却挡在他前面，构成了一个美丽的障碍物。他左手伸出去像是要抓住她，然后又犹豫了。他显然是为她温柔的女性气质折服了。","He started for the door of the dining-room, but she interposed, and a very beautiful obstacle she made of herself.His left hand went out as if to grip her, then hesitated.He was patently awed by her soft womanhood."
"“瞧！”她得意地大叫道，“我就知道你不会那么做的。”","“There!” she cried triumphantly.“I knew you wouldn’t.”"
"这个男人有些局促不安。","The man was embarrassed."
"“我从未粗鲁地对待过一位女士，”他解释说，“要我那样做并不容易。可要是你开始尖叫的话，我肯定会那么做的。”","“I ain’t never manhandled a woman yet,” he explained, “and it don’t come easy.But I sure will, if you set to screaming.”"
"“你不愿意呆几分钟聊一会儿吗？”她劝说道，“我很感兴趣。我愿意听你解释一下入室盗窃为什么就是搜罗属于你的东西。”","“Won’t you stay a few minutes and talk?” she urged.“I’m so interested.I should like to hear you explain how burglary is collecting what is coming to you.”"
"他钦佩地看着她。","He looked at her admiringly."
"“我总以为女人们害怕强盗，”他坦承说，“可你看起来一点儿都不怕。”","“I always thought women-folks were scairt of robbers,” he confessed.“But you don’t seem none.”"
"她欢快地笑起来。","She laughed gaily."
"“强盗也有不同，你知道。我不害怕你，因为我相信你不是会伤害女人的那种家伙。来，跟我聊会儿吧。没有人会打扰我们，就我一个人。我的——父亲乘夜车去纽约了。仆人们都在睡觉。我想给你找点儿东西吃——女人们总是为她们半夜撞见的窃贼准备晚餐，至少在杂志故事里是这样的。但我不知道去哪儿找吃的。或许你要喝点什么？”","“There are robbers and robbers, you know.I am not afraid of you, because I am confident you are not the sort of creature that would harm a woman.Come, talk with me a while.Nobody will disturb us.I am all alone.My—father caught the night train to New York.The servants are all asleep.I should like to give you something to eat—women always prepare midnight suppers for the burglars they catch, at least they do in the magazine stories.But I don’t know where to find the food.Perhaps you will have something to drink?”"
"他犹豫了一下，没有回答，可她能从他的眼睛里看出他对她的钦佩。","He hesitated, and did not reply; but she could see the admiration for her growing in his eyes."
"“你不害怕吧？”她问道，“我不会给你下毒的，我保证。我和你一起喝，证明给你看它没毒。”","“You’re not afraid?” she queried.“I won’t poison you, I promise.I’ll drink with you to show you it is all right.”"
"“你确实是个惊喜，”他断言，并且第一次放低了武器，把枪挂在了一侧。“任何人都不需要再告诉我城里的女人会害怕了。你算不了什么——只是个柔弱漂亮的小家伙。但你确实有胆量。另外，你还很值得信任。这样的女人和男人都很少了。谁会像你这样对待一个带着枪的男人呢。”","“You sure are a surprise package of all right,” he declared, for the first time lowering the weapon and letting it hang at his side.“No one don’t need to tell me ever again that women-folks in cities is afraid.You ain’t much—just a little soft pretty thing.But you’ve sure got the spunk.And you’re trustful on top of it.There ain’t many women, or men either. who’d treat a man with a gun the way you’re treating me.”"
"听了这番赞美，她开心地笑了，并且一脸认真地说道：","She smiled her pleasure in the compliment, and her face, was very earnest as she said:"
"“那是因为我喜欢你的样子。你样子很体面，不像是个强盗。你不应该干这些行当。要是你运气不好，应该去工作的。来，收起那把讨厌的左轮手枪把，我们来聊聊。适合你的行当是去工作。”","“That is because I like your appearance.You are too decent-looking a man to be a robber.You oughtn’t to do such things.If you are in bad luck you should go to work.Come, put away that nasty revolver and let us talk it over.The thing for you to do is to work.”"
"“不是在这个城市，”他愤愤地评说道，“为了找工作，我把腿都跑掉两英寸了。老实说，我曾是个优秀的大个子男人……在我开始找工作之前。”","“Not in this burg,” he commented bitterly.“I’ve walked two inches off the bottom of my legs trying to find a job.Honest, I was a fine large man once…before I started looking for a job.”"
"听了他的这番俏皮话，她欢快地笑了起来，这显然让他很高兴，而她很快注意到了这一点并趁机利用。她从门口径直走向餐具柜。","The merry laughter with which she greeted his sally obviously pleased him, and she was quick to note and take advantage of it.She moved directly away from the door and toward the sideboard."
"“来，你得全部都告诉我，我去给你拿喝的。要喝什么？威士忌？”","“Come, you must tell me all about it while I get that drink for you.What will it be?Whisky?”"
"“好的，女士。”他接着她的话说道，尽管仍拿着那把大左轮手枪放在身侧，尽管他不情愿地看了看那敞开的无人看守的门。","“Yes, ma’am,” he said, as he followed her, though he still carried the big revolver at his side, and though he glanced reluctantly at the unguarded open door."
"她在餐具柜旁给他倒满了一杯酒。","She filled a glass for him at the sideboard."
"“我说过要和你一起喝的，”她犹豫着说道，“但是我不喜欢威士忌，我……我更喜欢雪利酒。”","“I promised to drink with you,” she said hesitatingly.“But I don’t like whisky.I…I prefer sherry.”"
"她试探性地拿起雪利酒的瓶子，看他同不同意。","She lifted the sherry bottle tentatively for his consent."
"“当然。”他点了下头，回答说，“威士忌是男人喝的，我从不喜欢看见女人沾它。葡萄酒更适合她们。”","“Sure,” he answered, with a nod.“Whisky’s a man’s drink.I never like to see women at it.Wine’s more their stuff.”"
"她向他举起酒杯，眼神温柔，充满同情。","She raised her glass to his, her eyes meltingly sympathetic."
"“给你找个好职位——”","“Here’s to finding you a good position—”"
"但看到他一脸惊讶和嫌恶的表情，她突然住口了。他没怎么碰这酒杯，就把酒杯从他扭歪的唇边移走了。","But she broke off at sight of the expression of surprised disgust on his face.The glass, barely touched, was removed from his wry lips."
"“怎么了！”她焦虑地问道，“你不喜欢？我做错什么了吗？”","“What is the matter!” she asked anxiously.“Don’t you like it?Have I made a mistake?”"
"“这威士忌真是古怪。尝起来，它像是经过烟熏火烧而成的。”","“It’s sure funny whisky.Tastes like it got burned and smoked in the making.”"
"“哦！我真糊涂！我给你的是苏格兰威士忌，你当然是习惯喝黑麦威士忌。让我换一下。”","“Oh!How silly of me!I gave you Scotch.Of course you are accustomed to rye.Let me change it.”"
"她换了个杯子，又找到那瓶对的酒，几乎像个母亲一样关切。","She was almost solicitiously maternal, as she replaced the glass with another and sought and found the proper bottle."
"“好点儿吗？”她问。","“Better?” she asked."
"“是的，女士。没有烟味在里面，肯定是真正的好东西。我都一周没喝酒了。有些顺滑、油腻，你知道的。不是化工厂产的。”","“Yes, ma’am.No smoke in it.It’s sure the real good stuff.I ain’t had a drink in a week.Kind of slick, that; oily, you know; not made in a chemical factory.”"
"“你酗酒？”这既是个问题，又是种质疑。","“You are a drinking man?”It was half a question, half a challenge."
"“不，女士，说不上。我耍过酒疯，大嚷大叫地骂过人，不过这种情况很少发生。但有时晴天霹雳从天而降的时候，就肯定会发生这种情况了。那么，谢谢你的好意，女士，我要离开了。”","“No, ma’am, not to speak of.I HAVE rared up and ripsnorted at spells, but most unfrequent.But there is times when a good stiff jolt lands on the right spot kerchunk, and this is sure one of them.And now, thanking you for your kindness, ma’am, I’ll just be a pulling along.”"
"但赛特利夫夫人不想失去她的窃贼。她一向太过镇定，缺乏浪漫的情怀，但此时的情景让她一阵激动，她为此感到高兴。另外，她知道没有危险。且不论他的下巴和目光坚定的棕色眼睛，他这个人还是非常温顺的。而且，她意识深处也隐约想要有个钦佩她的朋友来当听众。要是没有那个听众就太糟糕了。","But Mrs. Setliffe did not want to lose her burglar.She was too poised a woman to possess much romance, but there was a thrill about the present situation that delighted her.Besides, she knew there was no danger.The man, despite his jaw and the steady brown eyes, was eminently tractable.Also, farther back in her consciousness glimmered the thought of an audience of admiring friends.It was too bad not to have that audience."
"“你还没解释一下为什么在你这种情况下，入室行窃只是搜罗属于你自己的东西呢。”她说，“来，坐下，坐在这桌子旁告诉我。”","“You haven’t explained how burglary, in your case, is merely collecting what is your own,” she said.“Come, sit down, and tell me about it here at the table.”"
"她调整了自己的座位，让他坐在自己的对角。正如她注意到的，他仍旧保持着警觉，眼睛锐利地环视四周，目光最后总会和她的交汇，透着难以抑制的钦佩之情，但从来不会久留。她也注意到在她说话时，他是在专注地听其他的声音，而不是她的话。他也没有丢下左轮手枪，而是把它放在他俩之间的桌角上，枪柄就在他的右手边。","She maneuvered for her own seat, and placed him across the corner from her.His alertness had not deserted him, as she noted, and his eyes roved sharply about, returning always with smoldering admiration to hers, but never resting long.And she noted likewise that while she spoke he was intent on listening for other sounds than those of her voice.Nor had he relinquished the revolver, which lay at the corner of the table between them, the butt close to his right hand."
"但是他是在一个他不了解的新环境中。这个来自西部的男人精通在森林和平原生存的知识。他睁大眼睛、竖起耳朵，紧张又多疑，却不知道在桌子下面靠近她脚的地方有一个电铃的按钮。他从没听说过这样的装置，再敏锐和警惕都是徒劳。","But he was in a new habitat which he did not know.This man from the West, cunning in woodcraft and plainscraft, with eyes and ears open, tense and suspicious, did not know that under the table, close to her foot, was the push button of an electric bell.He had never heard of such a contrivance, and his keenness and wariness went for naught."
"“是这样的，小姐，”他回应了她的迫切要求，“老赛特利夫曾经在一次小生意中把我搞垮了。手段卑鄙，却奏效了。只要花上几千万，什么事都能办得圆满合法。我不是在抱怨，也不是在抨击你爸爸。他根本不知道我是谁，我猜他都不知道他把我整得一无所有。他太成功了，想的做的都是上百万的生意，是不会听说过我这么一个小人物的。他是个经营者。他有各类专家为他谋划和工作，我听说有些专家赚的工资比美国总统还多。我只是被你爸爸搞垮的数千人中的一个，就这样而已。”","“It’s like this, Miss,” he began, in response to her urging.“Old Setliffe done me up in a little deal once.It was raw, but it worked.Anything will work full and legal when it’s got few hundred million behind it.I’m not squealin’, and I ain’t taking a slam at your pa.He don’t know me from Adam, and I reckon he don’t know he done me outa anything.He’s too big, thinking and dealing in millions, to ever hear of a small potato like me.He’s an operator.He’s got all kinds of experts thinking and planning and working for him, some of them, I hear, getting more cash salary than the President of the United States.I’m only one of thousands that have been done up by your pa, that’s all."
"“你看，女士，我本来有个小小的安身之处——我有一家小型水利公司。后来赛特利夫一群人在爱达荷州落住脚，他们重组了冶炼厂托拉斯，拉拢了这片土地上的其他人，完成了在特温派恩斯的水利项目，所以我肯定得被压榨。我从没追讨过我的钱。第一次重组前，我就在名单上被抹去了。所以今晚，因为自己破产了，而且朋友也很需要我，我就来串一下门，从你爸爸这儿弄点儿钱。鉴于我需要它，那么它就算是属于我的了。”","“You see, ma’am, I had a little hole in the ground—a dinky, hydraulic, one-horse outfit of a mine.And when the Setliffe crowd shook down Idaho, and reorganized the smelter trust, and roped in the rest of the landscape, and put through the big hydraulic scheme at Twin Pines, why I sure got squeezed.I never had a run for my money.I was scratched off the card before the first heat.And so, to-night, being broke and my friend needing me bad, I just dropped around to make a raise outa your pa.Seeing as I needed it, it kinda was coming to me.”"
"“姑且承认你说的都是真的，”她说，“不过入室抢劫就是入室抢劫。你不能在法庭上这样辩护。”","“Granting all that you say is so,” she said, “nevertheless it does not make house-breaking any the less house-breaking.You couldn’t make such a defense in a court of law.”"
"“我知道，”他顺从地坦言道，“对的事不一定都是合法的。这就是为什么我坐在这儿和你谈话会这么不自在的原因。并不是说我不喜欢和你呆在一起——我确定我是喜欢的——可我只是担负不起被抓起来的后果。我知道在这个城市他们会怎么对待我。上个星期，有个年轻的小伙子只是在街上抢劫了一个人两美元八十五美分，就被判了五十年。我是在报纸上看到的。经济不景气又没有工作可做的时候，人们就会铤而走险。另外还有一些人，他们还有些家底，可能会被抢，这些人也变得不顾一切，就肯定会去敲另一些人的竹杠。如果我被捕了，我想我至少会被判十年。这就是我想赶紧上路的原因。”","“I know that,” he confessed meekly.“What’s right ain’t always legal.And that’s why I am so uncomfortable a-settin’ here and talking with you.Not that I ain’t enjoying your company—I sure do enjoy it—but I just can’t afford to be caught.I know what they’d do to me in this here city.There was a young fellow that got fifty years only last week for holding a man up on the street for two dollars and eighty-five cents.I read about it in the paper.When times is hard and they ain’t no work, men get desperate.And then the other men who’ve got something to be robbed of get desperate, too, and they just sure soak it to the other fellows.If I got caught, I reckon I wouldn’t get a mite less than ten years.That’s why I’m hankering to be on my way.”"
"“不，等等。”她抬起手来想留住他，同时把脚从电铃上移开，之前她一直在断断续续地踩那个按钮。“你还没有告诉我你的名字。”","“No; wait.”She lifted a detaining hand, at the same time removing her foot from the bell, which she had been pressing intermittently.“You haven’t told me your name yet.”"
"他犹豫了一下。","He hesitated."
"“叫我戴夫。”","“Call me Dave.”"
"“那么……戴夫，”她笑着说，有些语无伦次。“一定要为你做点儿什么。你是个年轻人，只是刚开始做坏事。如果你开始只是想搜罗你认为属于自己的东西的话，之后你就会搜罗绝对不属于你的东西。你知道结局会是什么。与其如此，我们得给你找点儿体面的事做。”","“Then …Dave,” she laughed with pretty confusion.“Something must be done for you.You are a young man, and you are just at the beginning of a bad start.If you begin by attempting to collect what you think is coming to you, later on you will be collecting what you are perfectly sure isn’t coming to you.And you know what the end will be.Instead of this, we must find something honorable for you to do.”"
"“我需要那笔钱，现在就需要。”他固执地回答，“不是为我自己，而是为了我跟你说的那个朋友。他处于重重困难中，现在必须振作起来，否则就晚了。”","“I need the money, and I need it now,” he replied doggedly.“It’s not for myself, but for that friend I told you about.He’s in a peck of trouble, and he’s got to get his lift now or not at all.”"
"“我能给你找个职位，”她很快说，“而且——是的，就是那个职位——！我会借给你你要给朋友的钱。你可以用你的工资还给我。”","“I can find you a position,” she said quickly.“And—yes, the very thing—! I’ll lend you the money you want to send to your friend.This you can pay back out of your salary.”"
"“大约要三百，”他慢慢地说，“三百就能让他渡过难关。为了这个，也为了维持我的生计，为了有几分钱买《百万金臂》看，我会拼了命工作一年。”","“About three hundred would do,” he said slowly.“Three hundred would pull him through.I’d work my fingers off for a year for that, and my keep, and a few cents to buy Bull Durham with.”"
"“啊！你抽烟！我从没想过这个。”","“Ah!You smoke!I never thought of it.”"
"她的手朝他放在左轮手枪附近的手伸去，指着他手指上烟熏的黄印说道。同时，她目测了一下自己的手和他的手离枪有多近。她渴望一把抓住枪。她确定自己能够做到，但又没那么确定，于是她收回手的时候克制住了自己。","Her hand went out over the revolver toward his hand, as she pointed to the tell-tale yellow stain on his fingers.At the same time her eyes measured the nearness of her own hand and of his to the weapon.She ached to grip it in one swift movement.She was sure she could do it, and yet she was not sure; and so it was that she refrained as she withdrew her hand."
"“你想抽烟吗？”她邀请道。","“Won’t you smoke?” she invited."
"“我特别想抽。”","“I’m ’most dying to.”"
"“那就抽吧，我不介意。我真的喜欢烟——香烟，我的意思是。”","“Then do so.I don’t mind.I really like it—cigarettes, I mean.”"
"他左手伸进侧兜里，拿出一张质地疏松的草浆纸，又把它换到左轮手枪旁边的右手上。他又把手伸进去，捏了一撮棕色的烟叶片放到纸上。接着他又将烟卷起来，两手都在左轮手枪正上方。","With his left hand he dipped into his side pocket, brought out a loose wheat-straw paper and shifted it to his right hand close by the revolver.Again he dipped, transferring to the paper a pinch of brown, flaky tobacco.Then he proceeded, both hands just over the revolver, to roll the cigarette."
"“你一直靠那把讨厌的武器很近，看起来你怕我。”她挑衅地说道。","“From the way you hover close to that nasty weapon, you seem to be afraid of me,” she challenged."
"“并不是怕你，女士，而是在这种情况下有点胆怯而已。”","“Not exactly afraid of you, ma’am, but, under the circumstances, just a mite timid.”"
"“可我一直都没怕你。”","“But I’ve not been afraid of you.”"
"“你没有什么可以失去的。”","“You’ve got nothing to lose.”"
"“我的命。”她反驳说。","“My life,” she retorted."
"“没错，”他立刻承认，“但你还不害怕我。也许是我过于焦虑了。”","“That’s right,” he acknowledged promptly, “and you ain’t been scairt of me.Mebbe I am over anxious.”"
"“我不会伤害你一丝一毫的。”","“I wouldn’t cause you any harm.”"
"就在她说话的时候，她穿着拖鞋摸索到电铃踩了上去。同时，她的眼神热切，带着一种请求的真诚。","Even as she spoke, her slipper felt for the bell and pressed it.At the same time her eyes were earnest with a plea of honesty."
"“你懂得评判男人，我知道，也懂得评判女人。当然，当我试图劝你离开犯罪道路并想给你找份正当的工作时……？”","“You are a judge of men.I know it.And of women.Surely, when I am trying to persuade you from a criminal life and to get you honest work to do…?”"
"他顿时悔悟。","He was immediately contrite."
"“我真心请求你的原谅，女士。”他说，“我想我的紧张不能表达我的敬意。”","“I sure beg your pardon, ma’am,” he said.“I reckon my nervousness ain’t complimentary.”"
"他说着，右手离开桌子，点上烟后垂在了身侧。","As he spoke, he drew his right hand from the table, and after lighting the cigarette, dropped it by his side."
"“谢谢你的信任。”她轻柔地说道，断然地目测着与左轮手枪的距离，同时脚稳稳地踩着电铃。","“Thank you for your confidence,” she breathed softly, resolutely keeping her eyes from measuring the distance to the revolver, and keeping her foot pressed firmly on the bell."
"“那么那三百，”他开始说，“我可以今晚电汇到西部。我会同意工作一年以还上这笔钱并维持我的生计。”","“About that three hundred,” he began.“I can telegraph it West to-night.And I’ll agree to work a year for it and my keep.”"
"“你挣的会比那多。我能保证一个月至少七十五美金。你了解马匹吗？”","“You will earn more than that.I can promise seventy-five dollars a month at the least.Do you know horses?”"
"他面露喜色，眼睛发亮。","His face lighted up and his eyes sparkled."
"“那就为我工作——或为我的父亲工作，更确切地说，尽管是我雇佣了所有的仆人。我还需要一个马车夫——”","“Then go to work for me—or for my father, rather, though I engage all the servants.I need a second coachman—”"
"“那要穿制服？”他突然打断道，这个生性自由的西部人冷笑着，从他的嗓音中可以听出来，他嘴唇的样子也显示了这点。","“And wear a uniform?” he interrupted sharply, the sneer of the free-born West in his voice and on his lips."
"她容忍地笑了笑。","She smiled tolerantly."
"“显然不是那样的。让我想想，是的，你能驾驭小马驹吗？”","“Evidently that won’t do.Let me think.Yes.Can you break and handle colts?”"
"他点点头。","He nodded."
"“我们有个畜牧场，那儿有个空缺正好适合像你这样的人。你愿意接受吗？”","“We have a stock farm, and there’s room for just such a man as you.Will you take it?”"
"“我愿意吗，女士？”他的声音中满是感激和热忱。“带我去吧，我明天就努力工作。我能向你保证一件事，女士，你永远都不会后悔向身处困境的休吉·卢克伸出援手——”","“Will I, ma’am?”His voice was rich with gratitude and enthusiasm.“Show me to it.I’ll dig right in to-morrow.And I can sure promise you one thing, ma’am.You’ll never be sorry for lending Hughie Luke a hand in his trouble—”"
"“我记得你说过要叫你戴夫。”她责备他说，却是宽恕的口气。","“I thought you said to call you Dave,” she chided forgivingly."
"“我是说过，女士，我说过。请务必原谅我，我只是胡说的。我的真名叫休吉·卢克。如果你给我你们畜牧场的地址，还有到那儿的火车票钱，我一大早就直奔过去。”","“I did, ma’am.I did.And I sure beg your pardon.It was just plain bluff.My real name is Hughie Luke.And if you’ll give me the address of that stock farm of yours, and the railroad fare, I head for it first thing in the morning.”"
"在他们谈话的过程中，她一直在踩电铃。她用一切打警报的方式踩电铃——三短一长，两短一长，还有踩五下的。她试过踩一连串短的铃声，还有一次，她踩着电钮足足有三分钟。她一面斥责那个酣睡的傻男佣，一面怀疑这个电铃是不是坏掉了。","Throughout the conversation she had never relaxed her attempts on the bell.She had pressed it in every alarming way—three shorts and a long, two and a long, and five.She had tried long series of shorts, and, once, she had held the button down for a solid three minutes.And she had been divided between objurgation of the stupid, heavy-sleeping butler and doubt if the bell were in order."
"“我很高兴，”她说，“很高兴你愿意。没多少要安排的。但你先要相信我，因为我要去楼上取我的钱包。”","“I am so glad,” she said; “so glad that you are willing.There won’t be much to arrange.But you will first have to trust me while I go upstairs for my purse.”"
"她看到他眼里立刻闪过怀疑的目光，于是赶紧说，“但是你看我可是信任你的，给了你这三百美元。”","She saw the doubt flicker momentarily in his eyes, and added hastily, “But you see I am trusting you with the three hundred dollars.”"
"“我相信你，女士，”他又变得殷勤起来，“然而我就是控制不住这种紧张情绪。”","“I believe you, ma’am,” he came back gallantly.“Though I just can’t help this nervousness.”"
"“我能去拿吗？”","“Shall I go and get it?”"
"但还没等得到许可，她就隐约听见远处传来微弱低沉又刺耳的声音。她知道那是男佣配餐室的双向弹簧门的声音。但这声音如此微弱——更像是轻微的震动，而不像是个声音——要不是她竖起耳朵仔细听着，可能都听不到。然而这个人听见了。他表面上泰然自若，其实被吓了一跳。","But before she could receive consent, a slight muffled jar from the distance came to her ear.She knew it for the swing-door of the butler’s pantry.But so slight was it—more a faint vibration than a sound—that she would not have heard had not her ears been keyed and listening for it.Yet the man had heard.He was startled in his composed way."
"“是什么？”他问道。","“What was that?” he demanded."
"作为回应，她突然伸出左手抓住左轮手枪，把它拿过来。她先于他行动，而这也是必要的，因为下一刻他就突然抬起身侧的手去抓枪，可枪已经不在那儿了，他抓了个空。","For answer, her left hand flashed out to the revolver and brought it back.She had had the start of him, and she needed it, for the next instant his hand leaped up from his side, clutching emptiness where the revolver had been."
"“坐下！”她严厉地命令道，这次的口气很不同，“不许动，把你的手放在桌子上。”","“Sit down!” she commanded sharply, in a voice new to him.“Don’t move.Keep your hands on the table.”"
"她从他身上吸取到了教训。她没有将这把重型武器平举起来，而是将枪柄和前臂抵在桌子上，枪口对准他的胸膛，而不是他的头。他冷静地看着，服从了她的命令，他知道就凭枪的后坐力就一定会打中。他还注意到这把左轮手枪并没有晃动，手也没抖，他非常清楚这软头子弹能打多大的洞。他的眼睛不是在看她，而是盯着在食指扣动扳机产生的压力的作用下升起的击铁。","She had taken a lesson from him.Instead of holding the heavy weapon extended, the butt of it and her forearm rested on the table, the muzzle pointed, not at his head, but his chest.And he, looking coolly and obeying her commands, knew there was no chance of the kick-up of the recoil producing a miss.Also, he saw that the revolver did not wabble, nor the hand shake, and he was thoroughly conversant with the size of hole the soft-nosed bullets could make.He had eyes, not for her, but for the hammer, which had risen under the pressure of her forefinger on the trigger."
"“我想我最好警告你，扳机活动的地方被锉得相当光滑。别扣得太用力，否则我身上就得打个核桃大小的洞了。”","“I reckon I’d best warn you that that there trigger-pull is filed dreadful fine.Don’t press too hard, or I’ll have a hole in me the size of a walnut.”"
"她把击铁往下松了松。","She slacked the hammer partly down."
"“那样好些，”他说，“你最好把枪彻底放下。你看它多容易操作，要是你想的话，轻轻一扣它就走火了，然后把你漂亮的地板弄得一团糟。”","“That’s better,” he commented.“You’d best put it down all the way.You see how easy it works.If you want to, a quick light pull will jiffy her up and back and make a pretty mess all over your nice floor.”"
"身后的门开了，他听见有人进了屋。但他没有回头。他正看着她，在她身上发现了另一个女人的脸孔——严酷、冷漠、无情，却又美丽而聪明。这双眼睛也很严酷，尽管闪着冰冷的目光。","A door opened behind him, and he heard somebody enter the room.But he did not turn his bead.He was looking at her, and he found it the face of another woman—hard, cold, pitiless yet brilliant in its beauty.The eyes, too, were hard, though blazing with a cold light."
"“托马斯，”她命令道，“去给警察打电话。为什么这么久你才有回应？”","“Thomas,” she commanded, “go to the telephone and call the police.Why were you so long in answering?”"
"“我一听到电铃就赶来了，夫人。”仆人回答说。","“I came as soon as I heard the bell, madam,” was the answer."
"这个盗贼一直盯着她的眼睛，她也没有把目光移开，只是在提到电铃时，她注意到他的眼中闪过一丝困惑。","The robber never took his eyes from hers, nor did she from his, but at mention of the bell she noticed that his eyes were puzzled for the moment."
"“对不起，”身后的男佣说，“我去拿把武器，把仆人们也都叫醒不是更好吗？”","“Beg your pardon,” said the butler from behind, “but wouldn’t it be better for me to get a weapon and arouse the servants?”"
"“不，给警察打电话。我能制住这个人。去打电话——快。”","“No; ring for the police.I can hold this man.Go and do it—quickly.”"
"男佣穿着拖鞋走出了屋子，这个男人和这个女人继续坐在那儿，凝视着彼此的眼睛。对她来说这是一次十分愉快的经历，她脑子里想的是自己圈子里的人对她的小声议论，她也预见到社会周刊上关于年轻美丽的赛特利夫夫人单枪匹马制服持枪劫匪的报道。她确定会引起一场轰动。","The butler slippered out of the room, and the man and the woman sat on, gazing into each other’s eyes.To her it was an experience keen with enjoyment, and in her mind was the gossip of her crowd, and she saw notes in the society weeklies of the beautiful young Mrs. Setliffe capturing an armed robber single-handed.It would create a sensation, she was sure."
"“当你受到你曾提到的刑罚时，”她冷冷地说，“你会有时间想想你都有多愚蠢——侵犯他人财产，持枪威胁妇女。你会有时间彻底地吸取教训。现在说实话吧，你没有什么身陷困境的朋友，你告诉我的都是一派谎言。”","“When you get that sentence you mentioned,” she said coldly, “you will have time to meditate upon what a fool you have been, taking other persons’ property and threatening women with revolvers.You will have time to learn your lesson thoroughly.Now tell the truth.You haven’t any friend in trouble.All that you told me was lies.”"
"他没有回答。尽管他的眼睛盯着她，却是一片茫然。顷刻间，她的真面目展现在他的面前。他看到了阳光沐浴下广阔的西部空地，那里的男人和女人都比他在这个堕落太多的东部城市里遇见的居民要大度、亲切。","He did not reply.Though his eyes were upon her, they seemed blank.In truth, for the instant she was veiled to him, and what he saw was the wide sunwashed spaces of the West, where men and women were bigger than the rotten denizens, as he had encountered them, of the thrice rotten cities of the East."
"“继续，你为什么不说话？你为什么不再多扯些谎话？你为什么不请求我放走你？”","“Go on.Why don’t you speak?Why don’t you lie some more?Why don’t you beg to be let off?”"
"“我可能会，”他回答说，一边舔了舔自己干裂的嘴唇，“我可能会请求你放走我，如果……”","“I might,” he answered, licking his dry lips.“I might ask to be let off if…”"
"“如果什么？”在他停顿的时候，她专横地问道。","“If what?” she demanded peremptorily, as he paused."
"“我是要想出个你让我联想到的词。就像我刚才所说的，你要是个体面的女人，我就可能会请求你放走我。”","“I was trying to think of a word you reminded me of.As I was saying, I might if you was a decent woman.”"
"她的脸色变得苍白。","Her face paled."
"“小心点儿。”她警告说。","“Be careful,” she warned."
"“你不会杀死我的，”他冷笑着说，“有你这样的人晃悠在这世上，世界可真是个可鄙的地方，但我想它还没可鄙到让你向我开枪的地步。你确实很坏，但你的麻烦是你还不够坏。杀死个人不算什么，但你还做不到。这就是你失败的地方。”","“You don’t dast kill me,” he sneered.“The world’s a pretty low down place to have a thing like you prowling around in it, but it ain’t so plumb low down, I reckon, as to let you put a hole in me.You’re sure bad, but the trouble with you is that you’re weak in your badness.It ain’t much to kill a man, but you ain’t got it in you.There’s where you lose out.”"
"“你说话小心点儿，”她重复说，“否则，我警告你，你会有苦头吃的。这可能关系到你的判罚是轻是重。”","“Be careful of what you say,” she repeated.“Or else, I warn you, it will go hard with you.It can be seen to whether your sentence is light or heavy.”"
"“这是上帝的问题，”他绕开这个话题说，“放任你晃荡在这个世界上。我完全不明白他在做什么，跟可怜的人类开这样的玩笑。现在如果我是上帝的话——”","“Something’s the matter with God,” he remarked irrelevantly, “to be letting you around loose.It’s clean beyond me what he’s up to, playing such-like tricks on poor humanity.Now if I was God—”"
"男佣进了屋，打断了他继续发表自己的意见。","His further opinion was interrupted by the entrance of the butler."
"“电话坏了，夫人。”他说，“电线缠在了一起还是什么的，因为我打不通总局。”","“Something is wrong with the telephone, madam,” he announced.“The wires are crossed or something, because I can’t get Central.”"
"“去叫个仆人，”她命令道，“派他去叫个警察，然后回到这儿来。”","“Go and call one of the servants,” she ordered.“Send him out for an officer, and then return here.”"
"这两个人又一次被单独留在了这儿。","Again the pair was left alone."
"“你能好心回答个问题吗，女士？”这个男人说，“那个仆人说了什么电铃。我像猫一样盯着你，你肯定没有按响电铃。”","“Will you kindly answer one question, ma’am?” the man said.“That servant fellow said something about a bell.I watched you like a cat, and you sure rung no bell.”"
"“它在桌子底下，你这个可怜的傻瓜。我是用脚踩的。”","“It was under the table, you poor fool.I pressed it with my foot.”"
"“谢谢你，女士。我就想我之前见过你这样的人，现在我确定自己见过。我信任你，跟你说实话，而你却一直都在拼命地骗我。”","“Thank you, ma’am.I reckoned I’d seen your kind before, and now I sure know I have.I spoke to you true and trusting, and all the time you was lying like hell to me.”"
"她嘲弄地大笑。","She laughed mockingly."
"“接着说，想说什么就说什么，非常有意思。”","“Go on.Say what you wish.It is very interesting.”"
"“你向我送秋波，看上去温柔可亲，一直都在充分利用你穿着裙子而非裤子这个事实——你的脚一直都踩在桌子下面的电铃上。好，还有些安慰。我宁愿成为可怜的休吉·卢克在监狱里呆上十年，也不愿意做你这样的人。女士，地狱里满是你这样的女人。”","“You made eyes at me, looking soft and kind, playing up all the time the fact that you wore skirts instead of pants—and all the time with your foot on the bell under the table.Well, there’s some consolation.I’d sooner be poor Hughie Luke, doing his ten years, than be in your skin.Ma’am, hell is full of women like you.”"
"然后是一阵沉默，其间，男人一直盯着她，仔细端详她，他下了决心。","There was silence for a space, in which the man, never taking his eyes from her, studying her, was making up his mind."
"“接着说，”她敦促着，“说点儿什么。”","“Go on,” she urged.“Say something.”"
"“好的，女士，我会说点儿什么，我肯定会说点儿什么。你知道我要做什么吗？我要从这把椅子上站起来，然后走出那道门。我要从你手里把枪夺回来，只是你可能会愚蠢地让枪走了火。你可以留下这把枪，这是把好枪。正如我刚才说的，我就要从那道门走出去了。而你也不会开枪。向人开枪需要勇气，你肯定没有。现在准备好，看看你能不能扣动那扳机。我不会伤害你的。我要走出那道门，现在就要出发了。”","“Yes, ma’am, I’ll say something.I’ll sure say something.Do you know what I’m going to do?I’m going to get right up from this chair and walk out that door.I’d take the gun from you, only you might turn foolish and let it go off.You can have the gun.It’s a good one.As I was saying, I am going right out that door.And you ain’t going to pull that gun off either.It takes guts to shoot a man, and you sure ain’t got them.Now get ready and see if you can pull that trigger.I ain’t going to harm you.I’m going out that door, and I’m starting.”"
"他紧紧盯着她，把椅子往后推了推，缓缓地站了起来。击铁升到了一半。她盯着击铁。他也是。","Keeping his eyes fixed on her, he pushed back the chair and slowly stood erect.The hammer rose halfway.She watched it.So did he."
"“扣得更用力点儿，”他建议她说，“它还没有升到一半。继续扣动它来杀人。那就是我说过的，杀人，让他的脑浆迸裂在地，要不就是在他身上打个你拳头大小的洞。那就叫杀人。”","“Pull harder,” he advised.“It ain’t half up yet.Go on and pull it and kill a man.That’s what I said, kill a man, spatter his brains out on the floor, or slap a hole into him the size of your fist.That’s what killing a man means.”"
"击铁猝然降了下来，但是很轻。男人转身缓缓地朝门口走去。她转动左轮手枪，瞄准他的后背。击铁又一次升到一半的位置，然后勉强地缓缓停了下来。","The hammer lowered jerkily but gently.The man turned his back and walked slowly to the door.She swung the revolver around so that it bore on his back.Twice again the hammer came up halfway and was reluctantly eased down."
"在门口的地方，男人走出去之前转过身来停了一会儿。嘴角浮起一丝冷笑。他低声对她说着话，骂她卑劣可耻，差不多是在拉长着调子，可其中却凝结了一切的憎恶。","At the door the man turned for a moment before passing on.A sneer was on his lips.He spoke to her in a low voice, almost drawling, but in it was the quintessence of all loathing, as he called her a name unspeakable and vile."
