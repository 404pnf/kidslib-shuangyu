"诺丁汉矿乡杂记","Nottingham and the Mining Countryside"
"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯","by David Herbert Lawrence"
"我将近44年前出生于伊斯特伍德，这是一个人口约3000人的矿乡，距离诺丁汉大概八英里。一英里开外是埃里沃什小溪，它是诺丁汉郡和德比郡的分界线。这一带山多，往西16英里是克赖奇和马特洛克，往东和东北是曼斯菲尔德和舍伍德森林区。在我看来，它曾是，也仍是美丽至极的乡村，一边是遍布着红砂岩和橡树的诺丁汉，一边是有着冰冷的石灰石、白蜡树和石围墙的德比郡。在童年和青年时代，故乡在我看来仍是森林遍布、农田万顷的旧英格兰。这里没有汽车，矿井从某种意义上说，不过是偶然点缀乡间，罗宾汉和他的绿林好汉们离我们并不很远。","I was born nearly forty-four years ago, in Eastwood, a mining village of some three thousand souls, about eight miles from Nottingham, and one mile from the small stream, the Erewash, which divides Nottinghamshire from Derbyshire.It is hilly country, looking west to Crich and towards Matlock, sixteen miles away, and east and north-east towards Mansfield and the Sherwood Forest district.To me it seemed, and still seems, an extremely beautiful countryside, just between the red sandstone and the oak-trees of Nottingham, and the cold limestone, the ash-trees, the stone fences of Derbyshire.To me, as a child and young man, it was still the old England of the forest and agricultural past; there were no motor-cars, the mines were, in a sense, an accident in the landscape, and Robin Hood and his merry men were not very far away."
"B.W.公司大约在我出生前60年就已经在这儿开了许多煤矿。而伊斯特伍德就是在这些煤矿开了以后建立的。19世纪初，这儿肯定是一个小乡村，一个有村舍的小地方。这儿还有零星几排四间一户的小型矿工住所，是18世纪的老矿工们居住的地方。他们在小矿井里干活，有的矿井是在山一侧开个直达采矿区的巷道，让矿工钻进去干活，还有的是靠驴拉卷扬机，把矿工放在吊桶里一个个拉上地面。我父亲小时候，这种使用卷扬机的矿井仍在开工，而我小时候，也还能看到这种矿井。","The string of coal-mines of B. W. & Co. had been opened some sixty years before I was born, and Eastwood had come into being as a consequence.It must have been a tiny village at the beginning of the nineteenth century, a small place of cottages and fragmentary rows of little four-roomed miners’ dwellings, the homes of the old colliers of the eighteenth century, who worked in the bits of mines, foot-rill mines with an opening in the hillside into which the miners walked, or windlass mines, where the men were wound up one at a time, in a bucket, by a donkey.The windlass mines were still working when my father was a boy and the shafts of some were still there, when I was a boy."
"但1820年左右，公司肯定开挖了头一批大型矿井，不过挖得也不算很深。同时矿井也装上了第一批机器，成为真正的工业化煤矿了。就在那时，我祖父来到了这儿。他那会儿还很年轻，学过裁缝，从英格兰南部漂泊到此地，在布林斯利矿上找到了工作，做公司的裁缝。那时公司给矿工们发厚法兰绒背心或衬衣，还有法兰绒衬腰的软毛皮裤子，工人们就穿着这些衣服干活。我还记得幼年时，我祖父的裁缝店角落里堆放的大卷大卷的粗法兰绒和工作服料子，还有一台又大又古怪、世界上绝无仅有的老式缝纫机，缝着大量的矿工裤子。可在我还小的时候，公司就不再给工人们发工作服了。","But somewhere about 1820 the company must have sunk the first big shafts—not very deep—and installed the first machinery, or the real industrial colliery.Then came my grandfather, a young man trained to be a tailor, drifting from the south of England, and got the job of company tailor for the Brinsley mine.In those days the Company supplied the men with the thick flannel vests, or singlets, and the mole-skin trousers lined at the top with flannel, in which the colliers worked.I remember the great rolls of coarse flannel and pit-cloth which stood in the corner of my grandfather’s shop when I was a small boy, and the big, strange old sewing-machine, like nothing else on earth, which sewed the massive pit-trousers.But when I was only a child the company discontinued supplying the men with pit-clothes."
"我祖父在采石场石床上的一间老农舍住了下来。农舍就在老布林斯利矿的小溪旁，离矿井很近。公司在一英里开外的伊斯特伍德建了第一批矿工住所，那肯定是将近100年前的事了。如今看来，伊斯特伍德是在山顶上占了个好位置，一边是朝向德比郡的陡峭斜坡，一边是朝向诺丁汉的长长斜坡。公司建了一座新教堂，尽管它看上去很不怎么样，却占了个高高在上的好位置，隔着可怕的埃里沃什山谷与希诺教堂遥遥相对。那座教堂也同样占据了远处山上的一个高高在上的位置。机会难得，机会难得！这些矿乡也许能像意大利那些可爱的山城一样漂亮迷人。后来怎样了呢？","My grandfather settled in an old cottage down in a quarry-bed, by the brook at Old Brinsley, near the pit.A mile away, up at Eastwood, the Company built the first miners’ dwellings—it must be nearly a hundred years ago.Now Eastwood occupies a lovely position on a hill-top, with the steep slope towards Derbyshire and the long slope towards Nottingham.They put up a new church, which stands fine and commanding, even if it has no real form, looking across the awful Erewash Valley at the church of Heanor, similarly commanding, away on a hill beyond.What opportunities, what opportunities!These mining villages might have been like the lovely hill-towns of Italy, shapely and fascinating.And what happened?"
"那些一小排一小排的老式矿工住所大多都被拆了，而一溜单调乏味的小商店沿着诺丁汉路开了起来。在北边的下坡上，公司建起了“新建筑”，也叫“广场”，如今人们仍然这样称呼。这些“新建筑”由一些修在坑洼山坡上的房子构成，这些房子围成了两个大的空广场。这些四间一户的小房子，“正面”对着阴森空旷的街道；“背面”连着个砖砌的小四方院，由一道矮墙围着，里面有一个厕所和一个炉灰坑；房子和院子前面则是荒凉的广场，地面泥土坚硬不平、黑黢黢的，地势相当陡峭。四周都是这种小后院，院角处开着门。广场相当大，完全就是一片荒芜，只是上边戳了些杆子，用来绑晾衣绳。人们来来往往，孩子们在坚硬的地面上玩耍。这些建筑像兵营一样四面封闭，非常奇怪。","Most of the little rows of dwellings of the old-style miners were pulled down, and dull little shops began to rise along the Nottingham Road, while on the down-slope of the north side, the Company erected what is still known as the New Buildings, or the Square.These New Buildings consist of two great hollow squares of dwellings planked down on the rough slope of the hill, little four-room houses with the “front” looking outward into the grim blank street, and the “back”, with a tiny square brick yard, a low wall, and a W. C. and ash-pit, looking into the desert of the square, hard, uneven, jolting black earth tilting rather steeply down, with these little back yards all round, and openings at the corners.The squares were quite big, and absolutely desert save for the posts for clothes lines, and people passing, children playing on the hard earth.And they were shut in like a barracks enclosure, very strange."
"即使在50年前，这些广场也不讨人喜欢。住在广场上的都是“普通老百姓”。稍微好一点儿的住在布里奇，那是个有六个街区的住宅区，是公司在下面的山谷里建的比较像样的住房。三个街区一排，共两排，中间有一条小巷。最“寒碜”、最掉价的就是住在达金斯罗那儿了，两排老房子，破旧不堪、黑乎乎的，都是些四间一户的小房子，也立在离“广场”不远的山上。","Even fifty years ago the squares were unpopular.It was “common” to live in the Square.It was a little less common to live in The Breach, which consisted of six blocks of rather more pretentious dwellings erected by the Company in the valley below, two rows of three blocks, with an alley between.And it was most “common”, most degraded of all to live in Dakins Row, two rows of the old dwellings, very old, black, four-roomed little places, that stood on the hill again, not far from the Squares."
"这地方就这样发展起来了。在广场之间陡峭的斯卡吉尔街那头，建起了卫理公会礼拜堂，我就出生在教堂上方的街角小商店里。在“广场”的另一头，矿工们自己建了一座高大的、看上去像谷仓一样的原始卫理公会礼拜堂。诺丁汉路顺着山顶向前，路边散乱着几家丑陋的、维多利亚中期式样的商店。村子边上的小集市倒是挺好看的，集市那边就是德比郡了。集市当时已经荒芜，一边是太阳酒馆，对面是药店，摆着镀金的杵和臼；另一边奥尔弗里顿路和诺丁汉路相交的角落处开着一家商店。","So the place started.Down the steep street between the Squares, Scargill Street, the Wesleyan chapel was put up, and I was born in the little corner shop just above.Across the other side the square the miners themselves built the big barn-like Primitive Methodist Chapel.Along the hill-top ran the Nottingham Road, with its scrappy, ugly mid Victorian shops.The little market-place, with a superb outlook, ended the village on the Derbyshire side, and was just left bare, with the Sun Inn on one side, the chemist across, with the gilt pestle-and-mortar, and a shop at the other corner, the corner of Alfreton Road and Nottingham Road."
"在这新旧英格兰交替的不寻常而混乱的时代，我开始懂事了。我记得，一些本地的小投机商已经开始乱建成排的房子，总是成排地建，田野上都是这些令人讨厌的红砖房，四面平平，盖着黑石板屋顶。凸窗在我小时候才出现。但这儿的大多数房子都还没有这种构造。","In this queer jumble of the old England and the new, I came into consciousness.As I remember, little local speculators already began to straggle dwellings in rows, always in rows, across the fields: nasty redbrick flat-faced dwellings with dark slate roofs.The bay-window period only began when I was a child.But most of the country was untouched."
"“广场”和周围的街上肯定有三四百座公司的房子，像兵营一样层层包围。布里奇那边肯定有60或80座公司的房子。而老旧的达金斯罗地区则有三四十座小房子。再加上那些带老式园子的旧农舍和排屋：它们沿大街小巷而建，甚至在诺丁汉路中间也有。房子已经够住了，没必要建很多了。所以在我小时候，人们已经不怎么建新房了。","There must be three or four hundred Company houses in the Squares and the streets that surround the Squares, like a great barracks wall.There must be sixty or eighty Company houses in The Breach.The old Dakins Row will have thirty to forty little holes.Then counting the old cottages and rows left with their old gardens down the lanes and along the twitchells, and even in the midst of Nottingham Road itself, there were house enough for the population, there was no need for much building.And not much building went on, when I was small."
"我们住在布里奇街角的一座房子里。一条在高高的山楂树篱掩映下的田间小路一直通到我家。另一边便是小溪，溪上有一座古老的牧羊桥，通向牧场。溪边的山楂树篱已经长得像高大的树一般高了。我们过去常常去溪里的水洞洗澡，就在老水坝附近，那儿靠近瀑布，水流很急。人们也在那儿给羊洗药浴。我小时候，磨坊才不再磨面了。我父亲一直在布林斯利矿上干活，他总在早上四五点钟就起床，在黎明时分出发，穿过科尼格雷的田野去上班，一路上在草丛中采些蘑菇，或是捉一只躲躲藏藏的兔子，晚上下班后揣在工作服的衬里内带回家。","We lived in the Breach, in a corner house.A field-path came down under a great hawthorn hedge.On the other side was the brook, with the old sheep-bridge going over into the meadows.The hawthorn hedge by the brook had grown tall as tall trees: and we used to bathe from there in the dipping-hole, where the sheep were dipped: just near the fall from the old mill-dam, where the water rushed.The mill only ceased grinding the local corn when I was child.And my father, who always worked in Brinsley pit, and who always got up at five o’clock, if not at four, would set off in the dawn across the fields at Coney Grey, and hunt for mushrooms in the long grass, or perhaps pick up a skulking rabbit, which he would bring home at evening inside the lining of his pit-coat."
"因此，我们的生活处于一个奇特的交叉点：介于工业主义英国与莎士比亚、弥尔顿、菲尔丁和乔治·艾略特的农业英国之间。人们操着一口浓重的德比郡方言，总是把“你”说成“汝”和“尔”。人们几乎全然按照本能而生活。我父亲那个年纪的人压根就不识字。矿井并没有把人们变成机器。恰恰相反。在煤矿承包制度下，从事地下作业的矿工们形成了亲密的团体，他们工作时几乎赤裸相见，互相之间有着奇特的亲密感，地下的黑暗、矿坑的遥远和不断的危险让他们在肉体、本能和直觉上的接触都非常密切，几乎就像触摸一般，十分真实、十分强烈。这种肉体上的感觉和在一起时的亲密感在矿井下时最为强烈。当他们回到地面，重见阳光时，他们会眨眨眼。在某种程度上，他们不得不改变交流方式。然而他们把矿井下黑暗中那种奇特的亲密感、近乎赤裸的接触带到了地面上。每当我回想童年，似乎总觉得有一种内在的黑暗光辉，就像煤的光泽，我们就在那光辉里行走并获得自己真正的生命。我父亲热爱矿井。他曾不止一次身受重伤，但从未离开。他热爱那种接触和亲密感，就像战争中的男人们热爱黑暗岁月中男性间强烈的战友之情一样。直到他们失去了这份情谊之后，他们才明白自己究竟失去了什么。我认为如今的年轻矿工们也是这样。","So that the life was a curious cross between industrialism and the old agricultural England of Shakespeare and Milton and Fielding and George Eliot.The dialect was broad Derbyshire, and always “thee” and “thou”.The people lived almost entirely by instinct, men of my father’s age could not really read.And the pit did not mechanise men.On the contrary.Under the butty system, the miners worked underground as a sort of intimate community, they knew each other practically naked, and with curious close intimacy, and the darkness and the underground remoteness of the pit “stall”, and the continual presence of danger, made the physical, instinctive and intuitional contact between men very highly developed, a contact almost as close as touch, very real and very powerful.This physical awareness and intimate togetherness was at its strongest down pit.When the men came up into the light, they blinked.They had, in a measure, to change their flow.Nevertheless they brought with them above-ground the curious dark intimacy of the mine, the naked sort of contact, and if I think of my childhood, it is always as if there was a lustrous sort of inner darkness, like the gloss of coal, in which we moved and had our real being.My father loved the pit.He was hurt badly, more than once, but he would never stay away.He loved the contact, the intimacy, as men in the war loved the intense male comradeship of the dark days.They did not know what they had lost till they lost it.And I think it is the same with the young colliers of today."
"如今的矿工们也有一种美的本能。可他们的妻子却没有。矿工们凭着本能，生机勃勃地活着。但在白日里，他们既无雄心，也无才智。他们实际上是在躲避生活理性的一面。他们更喜欢凭本能和直觉来生活。他们甚至不怎么在乎工资的多少。自然，女人们才会为了这个而不断唠叨。我小时候，矿工和他们的妻子之间有很大差异：矿工们一天最多只能见到短短几个钟头的阳光，冬天里甚至常常一点儿也见不到；而他们的妻子，在他们下矿井时却能独自享有整个白天。","Now the colliers had also an instinct of beauty.The colliers’ wives had not.The colliers were deeply alive, instinctively.But they had no daytime ambition, and no daytime intellect.They avoided, really, the rational aspect of life.They preferred to take life instinctively and intuitively.They didn’t even care very profoundly about wages.It was the women, naturally, who nagged on this score.There was a big discrepancy when I was a boy, between the collier who saw, at the best, only a brief few hours of daylight, often no daylight at all, during the winter weeks: and the collier’s wife, who had all the day to herself, when the man was down pit."
"最大的谬误是觉得这些男人可怜。他们并不觉得自己可怜，直到那些煽动者和感伤主义者让他们有这种想法。他们本来很快乐，甚至不止是快乐，而是满足。或者说他们感到很满足，只是难以言表。矿工们去酒馆喝酒，是为了继续保持工友间的亲密感。他们不停地聊着，但大多是奇闻异事甚至政治，而非现实生活中的真事儿。正是沉重的现实——老婆、钱和使人不得安宁的家庭必需品，让他们从家中逃离，逃到酒馆，逃到矿井。","The great fallacy is, to pity the man.He didn’t dream of pitying himself, till agitators and sentimentalists taught him to.He was happy: or more than happy, he was fulfilled.Or he was fulfilled on the receptive side, not on the expressive.The collier went to the pub and drank, in order to continue his intimacy with his mates.They talked endlessly, but it was rather of wonders and marvels, even in politics, than of facts.It was hard facts, in the shape of wife, money, and nagging home necessities, which they fled away from, out of the house to the pub: and out of the house to the pit."
"矿工们抓住一切机会，能逃则逃，远离家中女人们唠唠叨叨的物质主义。和女人们在一起，总是围绕着“这个坏了，现在你得赶快修好！”或是“我们要这个、那个还有那个，钱从哪儿来？”这样的话题。——矿工们对这些一无所知，也不怎么在乎，他们的生活与这完全不同。所以他们逃了。他们带着狗在乡间游荡，猎兔子、掏鸟窝、采蘑菇等等等等。他们喜欢这乡村，那只是一种不加区分的感情。或者说他们就是喜欢蹲在那儿看着，什么都看或什么都不看。他们对动脑筋的事不感兴趣。生活对他们来说不是各种事情，而是一个流动的过程。很多时候，他们喜欢自家的花园。很多时候，他们对花的美有着真心的喜爱。这在矿工们当中实在是太常见了。","The collier fled out of the house as soon as he could, away from the nagging materialism of the woman.With the women, it was always: This is broken, now you’ve got to mend it!—or else: We want this, that and the other, and where is the money coming from?—The collier didn’t know and didn’t care very deeply—his life was otherwise.So he escaped.He roved the countryside, with his dog, prowling for a rabbit, for nests, for mushrooms, anything.He loved the countryside, just the indiscriminating feel of it.Or he loved just to sit on his heels and watch—anything or nothing.He was not intellectually interested.Life for him did not consist in facts, but in a flow.Very often, he loved his garden.And very often, he had a genuine love of the beauty of flowers.I have known it often and often, in colliers."
"如今，对花的喜爱很容易引起误解。大多数女人爱花，是把花当成所有物和装饰品。她们不会看着花，惊叹一番，然后接着干自己的事去。如果一朵花吸引了她们的注意力，她们肯定会立刻摘下来，拔下来。我的！属于我的！又有东西是我的啦！——如今大多数人对花所谓的喜爱，不过是伸手去占有，是利己主义：我得到了一些东西，它把我装扮得更美了。但是我见过许多矿工站在自家后花园里，低头看着一朵花，带着奇特而遥远的沉思表情，那表明他们真的觉察到了美的存在。那表情甚至不是钦慕、不是欣喜、不是愉快，也不是任何一种常常由本能的占有欲而引发的表情。那是一种沉思，是艺术家的萌芽。","Now the love of flowers is a very misleading thing.Most women love flowers as possessions, and as trimmings.They can’t look at a flower, and wonder a moment, and pass on.If they see a flower that arrests their attention, they must at once pick it, pluck it.Possession!A possession!Something added on to me!—And most of the so-called love of flowers today is merely this reaching out of possession and egoism: something I’ve got: something that embellishes me.Yet I’ve seen many a collier stand in his back garden looking down at a flower with that odd, remote sort of contemplation which show a real awareness of the presence of beauty.It would not even be admiration, or joy, or delight, or any of those things which so often have a root in the possessive instinct.It would be a sort of contemplation: which shows the incipient artist."
"英格兰的真正悲剧，在我看来，是丑陋的悲剧。乡村是如此可爱，而人造的英格兰却是如此丑恶。我小时候就知道，那些普通的矿工有着一种特殊的美感，这种美感来自于他们直觉和本能的意识，这一意识在矿井下被唤醒。但当他们回到地面上的日光中，遇见的都是冰冷的丑陋和粗鄙的物质主义。特别是当他们回到“广场”或布里奇，坐在自家餐桌前，他们身上就有什么东西被扼杀了，从某种意义上说，这毁了他们，使他们不再具有男人的特质。女人们几乎总在唠叨物质方面的事情。她们被教导去这样做，也被鼓励去这样做。母亲的责任是盯着自己的儿子，让他们“出人头地”，而男人的责任则是挣钱。在我父亲那一辈，男人们身后是狂野的旧英格兰，他们没怎么受教育，但不会被击垮。可是到了我这一辈，那些如今已经是矿工的男孩们，他们曾经和我一起上学，却全都被击垮了。他们是让寄宿学校的铃声、书本、电影和牧师们给击垮的，是让整个民族和全体人类不断强调物质繁荣凌驾于一切之上的想法给击垮的。","The real tragedy of England, as I see it, is the tragedy of ugliness.The country is so lovely: the man-made England is so vile.I know that the ordinary collier, when I was a boy, had a peculiar sense of beauty, coming from his intuitive and instinctive consciousness, which was awakened down pit.And the fact that he met with just cold ugliness and raw materialism when he came up into daylight, and particularly when he came to the Square or the Breach, and to his own table, killed something in him and in a sense, spoiled him as a man.The woman almost invariably nagged about material things.She was taught to do it; she was encouraged to do it.It was a mother’s business to see that her sons “got on”, and it was the man’s business to provide the money.In my father’s generation, with the old wild England behind them, and the lack of education, the man was not beaten down.But in my generation, the boys I went to school with, colliers now, have all been beaten down, what with the din-din-ding of Board Schools, books, cinemas, clergymen, the whole national and human consciousness hammering on the fact of material prosperity above all things."
"男人们被击垮了，一段时间内出现了繁荣，那是以他们的失败作为代价而取得的繁荣。接着，灾难悄然逼近。所有灾难的根源都是气馁。男人们气馁了。英格兰的男人们，尤其是矿工们，气馁了。他们被背叛了，被击垮了。","The men are beaten down, there is prosperity for a time, in their defeat—and then disaster looms ahead.The root of all disaster is disheartenment.And men are disheartened.The men of England, the colliers in particular, are disheartened.They have been betrayed and beaten."
"虽然如今或许没人知道，19世纪真正背叛男性精神的是丑陋。在繁荣的维多利亚时代，资产阶级和工业化的推行者们所犯下的重大罪行，就是让工人们深陷于丑陋，丑陋，丑陋：低劣杂乱又丑陋的环境、丑陋的理想、丑陋的宗教、丑陋的希望、丑陋的爱情、丑陋的衣服、丑陋的家具、丑陋的房子，丑陋的劳资关系。人的灵魂需要真实的美丽，更甚于需要面包。中产阶级嘲笑矿工买钢琴，但钢琴是什么，往往不只是钢琴，而是一种对美的盲目追求。对女人来说，钢琴是一份财产，一件家具，是能让她产生优越感的东西。但是看看老矿工们努力学琴的样子，看看他们听女儿弹奏《少女的祈祷》时那奇妙而专注的神情，你会发现一种对美盲目而永不满足的渴求。男人的这种渴求要比女人的深得多。女人想要炫耀。而男人想要的则是美，现在仍然是这样。","Now though perhaps nobody knew it, it was ugliness which really betrayed the spirit of man, in the nineteenth century.The great crime which the moneyed classes and promoters of industry committed in the palmy Victorian days was the condemning of the workers to ugliness, ugliness, ugliness: meanness and formless and ugly surroundings, ugly ideals, ugly religion, ugly hope, ugly love, ugly clothes, ugly furniture, ugly houses, ugly relationship between workers and employers.The human soul needs actual beauty even more than bread.The middle classes jeer at the colliers for buying pianos—but what is the piano, often as not, but a blind reaching out for beauty.To the woman it is a possession and a piece of furniture and something to feel superior about.But see the elderly colliers trying to learn to play, see them listening with queer alert faces to their daughter’s execution of The Maiden’s Prayer, and you will see a blind, unsatisfied craving for beauty.It is far more deep in the men than the women.The women want show.The men want beauty, and still want it."
"如果公司不是在山顶上建起了肮脏丑陋的“广场”，人们就可以有个可爱的地方游玩，那该多好啊。如果他们在小市集的中间竖根高柱子，在那令人愉快的地方修一圈有三面的拱廊，供人们在漂亮的房子前散步或是闲坐，那该多好啊！如果他们建起大而坚固的房子，五六间一户的公寓，有着漂亮的入口，那该多好啊。尤其是，如果他们鼓励唱歌跳舞，因为矿工们仍然喜爱歌舞，并为此提供漂亮的场地，那该多好啊。如果他们倡导漂亮的服饰、美丽的家居生活——好看的家具和装饰，那该多好啊。如果他们奖励人们做出最漂亮的椅子或桌子，织出最可爱的围巾，装饰出最美的房间，那该多好啊！要是他们曾做过这些，根本就不会出现什么工业化的问题。工业化的问题来自于其根基，强迫人们把所有的精力都仅仅用于为了获取而竞争。","If the Company, instead of building those sordid and hideous Squares, then, when they had that lovely site to play with, there on the hill top: if they had put a tall column in the middle of the small market-place, and run three parts of a circle of arcade round the pleasant space: where people could stroll or sit, and with handsome houses behind!If they had made big, substantial houses, in apartments of five or six rooms, and with handsome entrances.If above all, they had encouraged song and dancing—for the miners still sang and danced—and provided handsome space for these.If only they had encouraged some form of beauty in dress, some form of beauty in interior life—furniture, decoration.If they had given prizes for the handsomest chair or table, the loveliest scarf, the most charming room that the men or women could make!If only they had done this, there would never have been an industrial problem.The industrial problem arises from the base forcing of all human energy into a competition of mere acquisition."
"你也许会说，工人们不会接受这样的生活方式，英格兰人把家当成自己的城堡——“我自己的小家”——等等。但如果能听见隔壁邻居的所有对话，那可就算不得城堡了。如果能看见广场上所有的人，甚至能看到他们去厕所，那也就算不得城堡了！如果你的愿望是逃离你的“城堡”和你“自己的小家”呢！好吧，就没有太多可说的了。无论如何，只有女人才会把“她自己的小家”给偶像化，而女人总是最糟糕、最贪婪、占有欲最强，也最吝啬。对“小家”再也没什么可说的了，那是胡乱涂抹在地面上的丑陋而琐碎的玩意儿。","You may say the working man would not have accepted such a form of life: the Englishman’s home is his castle etc. etc—“My own little home”.But if you can hear every word the nextdoor people say, there’s not much castle.And if you can see everybody in the square, if they go to the W. C.!And if your one desire is to get out of your “castle” and your “own little home”! —well, there’s not much to be said for it.Anyhow it’s only the woman who idolises “her own little home”—and it’s always the woman at her worst, her most greedy, most possessive, most mean.There’s nothing to be said for the “little home” any more: a great scrabble of ugly pettiness over the face of the land."
"事实上，直到1800年，英格兰人还完全是乡下人，乡土味十足。几个世纪以来，英格兰一直都有城镇，但那从来都不是真正的城镇，只是一排排由街道连起的村庄，那从来也算不得是真正的城市。英格兰人的性格并未真正发展出人城市性的一面，即市民性的一面。意大利的锡耶纳是个小地方，但那是个真正的城市，市民们与城市紧密相连。诺丁汉是个大地方，人口正向百万发展，但它只是杂乱的一团。诺丁汉和锡耶纳根本不可同日而语。英格兰人愚蠢地没有成为市民。部分原因是他们“小家”的阻碍，部分则是他们接受了周围环境无可救药的微不足道。按照罗马人的标准，美国的新兴城市比伦敦或曼彻斯特更称得上是真正的城市。过去，就连爱丁堡都比任何英格兰的城镇要更像真正的城市。","As a matter of fact, till 1800 the English people were strictly a rural people—very rural.England has had towns for centuries, but they have never been real towns, only clusters of village streets.Never the real urbs.The English character has failed to develop the real urban side of a man, the civic side.Siena is a bit of a place, but it is a real city, with citizens intimately connected with the city.Nottingham is a vast place sprawling towards a million, and it is nothing more than an amorphous agglomeration.There is no Nottingham, in the sense that there is Siena.The Englishman is stupidly undeveloped as a citizen.And it is partly due to his “little home” stunt, and partly to his acceptance of hopeless paltriness in his surrounding.The new cities of America are much more genuine cities, in the Roman sense, than is London or Manchester.Even Edinburgh used to be more of a true city than any town England ever produced."
"“英格兰人的家就是他的城堡”和“我自己的小家”这种可笑而渺小的个人主义已经过时了。差不多1800年之前它可能还管用，那时候英格兰人都还是乡下人、农村汉。但工业制度带来了巨大的变化。不过英格兰人仍然喜欢把自己当成“农村汉”，想着“我的家，我的花园”。但现在这很幼稚。如今，就连农场工人也满心觉着自己是只城市鸟儿。如今，英格兰已经完全工业化了，所以不可避免，英格兰人也已经是彻头彻尾的城市鸟儿了。但他们并不知道如何建造一座城市，如何看待一座城市，如何在一座城市里生活。他们都是些市郊人、伪农村人，都不知道如何成为真正的市民：像罗马市民那样，或像雅典市民那样，甚至像巴黎市民那样，成为真正的市民，直到战争来临。","That silly little individualism of “the Englishman’s home is his castle”—and “my own little home” is out of date.It would work almost up to 1800, when every Englishman was still a villager and a cottager.But the industrial system has brought a great change.The Englishman still likes to think of himself as a “cottager”—“my home, my garden”.But it is puerile.Even the farm-laborer today is psychologically a town-bird.The English are town-birds through and through, today, as the inevitable result of their complete industrialisation.Yet they don’t know how to build a city, how to think of one, or how to live in one.They are all suburban, pseudo-cottagey, and not one of them knows how to be truly urban—the citizen as the Romans were citizens—or the Athenians—or even the Parisians, till the war came."
"这是因为我们一直压抑着自己的群体本能，这一本能能让我们以市民，而非村民的高姿态，骄傲而有尊严地团结在一起。伟大的城市意味着美、尊严与某种辉煌。英格兰人的这一面一直被压抑着，并且令人震惊地被背弃了：英格兰是一片小里小气、乱七八糟、微不足道的房子，而这竟然被称之为“家”。我相信，所有的英格兰人都从内心最深处厌恶自己的小家——女人除外。我们想要的，是一种更高的姿态、更宽广的视野，是某种辉煌、某种庄严，是美、恢弘的美。在这方面，美国人比我们做得好多了。","And this is because we have frustrated that instinct of community which would make us unite in pride and dignity in the bigger gesture of the citizen, not the cottager.The great city means beauty, dignity, and a certain splendour.This is the side of the Englishman that has been thwarted and shockingly betrayed: England is a mean and petty scrabble of paltry dwellings called “homes”.I believe in their heart of hearts all Englishmen loathe their little homes—but not the women.What we want is a bigger gesture, a greater scope, a certain splendour, a certain grandeur, and beauty, big beauty.The American does far better than we, in this."
"100年前，工业化的推进者们竟敢给我的家乡带去那样的丑陋。如今，更骇人听闻的是，工业化的推进者们在英格兰的大地上，胡乱建起绵延数英里、数平方英里的红砖“住宅”，就像可怕的疥癣。","And the promoter of industry, a hundred years ago, dared to perpetrate the ugliness of my native village.And still more monstrous, promoters of industry today are scrabbling over the face of England with miles and square miles of red-brick “homes”, like horrible scabs."
"住在这些红色小型捕鼠笼子里的男人们，就像被夹住的老鼠一样，越来越无助、越来越屈辱，也越来越不满。只有那些卑贱的女人，才会继续喜爱在丈夫眼中不过是鼠笼的小家。","And the men inside these little red rat-traps get more and more helpless, being more and more humiliated, more and more dissatisfied, like trapped rats.Only the meaner sort of women go on loving the little home which is no more than a rat-trap to her man."
"那么，抛弃这一切吧。无论付出什么代价，开始改变吧。别再管工资和行业纷争了。把注意力转向别的地方。把我的家乡拆个精光吧。规划一个核心。确定中心。让美好姿态从这一中心扩散。然后建起高楼大厦，漂亮的高楼大厦，扩展成一个城市中心。再用美来加以装饰。先确保有一个全新的开始。再一个地方一个地方地干下去。造就一个新的英格兰。让小家见鬼去吧！让那些乱七八糟、卑微琐碎和微不足道见鬼去吧。看看大地的轮廓，用足够的高尚，从这里开始建起。英格兰人的心理和精神或许足够健全。但作为辉煌城市的市民，他们比兔子还要卑贱。他们整天为了政治、工资之类的事唠唠叨叨，就像刻薄狭隘的家庭主妇。","Do away with it all, then.At no matter what cost, start in to alter it.Never mind about wages and industrial squabbling.Turn the attention elsewhere.Pull down my native village to the last brick.Plan a nucleus.Fix the focus.Make a handsome gesture of radiation from the focus.And then put up big buildings, handsome, that sweep to a civic centre.And furnish them with beauty.And make an absolute clean start.Do it place by place.Make a new England.Away with little homes!Away with scrabbling pettiness and, paltriness.Look at the contours of the land, and build up from these, with a sufficient nobility.The English may be mentally or spiritually developed.But as citizens of splendid cities they are more ignominous than rabbits.And they nag, nag all the time about politics and wages and all that, like mean narrow housewives."
