"流口水病房的故事","Told in the Drooling Ward"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"我？我不是个嘴角总流着口水的弱智。我是个助手。我不知道如果没有我，琼斯小姐或是凯尔茜小姐该怎么办。这个病房里有五十五个低级的流着口水的弱智，如果我不在，他们怎能全都吃饱了饭呢？我喜欢喂他们吃饭。他们不闹事捣乱。他们没有这个能力。他们大部分人的腿和胳膊都有毛病，而且他们不能说话。他们是非常低级的人。我能走路、能说话，还能做事。照顾这些弱智的时候你一定要小心，给他们喂食的时候不能太快。要不他们就会噎住。琼斯小姐说我是个专家。只要有新来的护士，我就会向她演示该怎么做。看新来的护士设法喂他们吃饭十分有趣。她喂得很慢、很小心，以至于到吃晚饭的时候，她还没把早饭给他们灌下去。然后我开始做示范，因为我是个专家。达尔林普尔医生说我是个专家，他应该最清楚不过了。只要掌握了正确的方法，你能让这些弱智吃得比平常快一倍。","Me?I’m not a drooler.I’m the assistant.I don’t know what Miss Jones or Miss Kelsey could do without me.There are fifty-five low-grade droolers in this ward, and how could they ever all be fed if I wasn’t around?I like to feed droolers.They don’t make trouble.They can’t.Something’s wrong with most of their legs and arms, and they can’t talk.They’re very low-grade.I can walk, and talk, and do things.You must be careful with the droolers and not feed them too fast.Then they choke.Miss Jones says I’m an expert.When a new nurse comes I show her how to do it.It’s funny watching a new nurse try to feed them.She goes at it so slow and careful that supper time would be around before she finished shoving down their breakfast.Then I show her, because I’m an expert.Dr. Dalrymple says I am, and he ought to know.A drooler can eat twice as fast if you know how to make him."
"我叫汤姆，今年二十八岁。这个机构里的每个人都认识我。你要知道，这是个社会公共机构。这个机构从属于加利福尼亚州，而且是以政治利益为经营目的的。我明白。我在这里呆了很久。每个人都信任我。在我不用忙着应付这些弱智的时候，就在这里四处跑跑腿。我喜欢流口水病人。这让我明白自己不是嘴角流着口水的弱智有多么幸运。","My name’s Tom.I’m twenty-eight years old.Everybody knows me in the institution.This is an institution, you know.It belongs to the State of California and is run by politics.I know.I’ve been here a long time.Everybody trusts me.I run errands all over the place, when I’m not busy with the droolers.I like droolers.It makes me think how lucky I am that I ain’t a drooler."
"我喜欢呆在“家”。我不喜欢外面的世界。我明白。我之前在这里呆过一段时间，也逃跑过，也被人收养过。我为“家”，为弱智病房，全心全意。我看起来不像流口水的弱智，是吧？你一看到我就知道有什么区别了。我是个助手，专业助手。对于一个弱智来说，这已经很了不得了。弱智？哦，就是智力低下的家伙。我以为你知道呢。我们在这里的都是弱智。","I like it here in the Home.I don’t like the outside.I know.I’ve been around a bit, and run away, and adopted.Me for the Home, and for the drooling ward best of all.I don’t look like a drooler, do I?You can tell the difference soon as you look at me.I’m an assistant, expert assistant.That’s going some for a feeb.Feeb?Oh, that’s feeble-minded.I thought you knew.We’re all feebs in here."
"但我是个高级的弱智。达尔林普尔医生说我很聪明，不应该呆在“家”，但我从没把这点泄露出去过。这是个相当不错的地方。而且不像很多弱智那样抽风。你透过这些树可以看见上面那栋房子。高级的弱智病人被单独安置在那里。他们都很高傲，因为他们不是一般的弱智。他们管那栋房子叫俱乐部会所，他们称自己和外边的人一样正常，他们只是生病而已。我不怎么喜欢他们。他们不抽风的时候就笑话我。不过，我不在乎。我永远也不需要害怕会跌倒、会摔破自己的脑袋。有时候，他们围成一圈转着跑，想很快找到一个坐的地方，可他们就是不坐。低级的病人倒人胃口，而高级的病人装腔作势。我很高兴自己不是个病人。他们不值一提。他们只会说大话，仅此而已。","But I’m a high-grade feeb.Dr. Dalrymple says I’m too smart to be in the Home, but I never let on.It’s a pretty good place.And don’t throw fits like lots of the feebs.You see that house up there through the trees.The high-grade epilecs all live in it by themselves.They’re stuck up because they ain’t just ordinary feebs.They call it the club house, and they say they’re just as good as anybody outside, only they’re sick.I don’t like them much.They laugh at me, when they ain’t busy throwing fits.But I don’t care.I never have to be scared about falling down and busting my head.Sometimes they run around in circles trying to find a place to sit down quick, only they don’t.Low-grade epilecs are disgusting, and high-grade epilecs put on airs.I’m glad I ain’t an epilec.There ain’t anything to them.They just talk big, that’s all."
"凯尔茜小姐说我话太多了。但我讲得合情合理，比其他的弱智强多了。达尔林普尔医生说我有语言天赋。我知道的。你应该听听我独自一人，或是只有一个弱智听众时的言语。有时候我觉得自己想做个政治家，就是太麻烦了。他们都擅于长篇大论，而这就是他们保住职位的法宝。","Miss Kelsey says I talk too much.But I talk sense, and that’s more than the other feebs do.Dr. Dalrymple says I have the gift of language.I know it.You ought to hear me talk when I’m by myself, or when I’ve got a drooler to listen.Sometimes I think I’d like to be a politician, only it’s too much trouble.They’re all great talkers; that’s how they hold their jobs."
"这个机构里没有疯子。他们只是智力低下。让我告诉你一些有趣的事。这里大约有十二个智力较为高级的女孩在宽敞的餐厅里摆餐具。有时她们提前干完了活，就会都坐在椅子上，围成一圈聊天。我悄悄到门边偷听，花了九牛二虎之力才憋住了笑声。你想知道她们都谈了些什么吗？是这样的。她们好长时间都不吐一个字。然后一个人说：“感谢上帝，我不是弱智。”于是，其他人都点点头，看起来心满意足的样子。接下来的一段时间，没有人开口说话。然后，这圈子里的另一个女孩说：“感谢上帝，我不是弱智。”然后其他人又都点点头。这一圈人就这样一个一个重复着，没有人说其他的内容。如今她们成了真正的弱智，不是吗？你自己判断吧。我可没弱智到那个程度，感谢上帝。","Nobody’s crazy in this institution.They’re just feeble in their minds.Let me tell you something funny.There’s about a dozen high-grade girls that set the tables in the big dining room.Sometimes when they’re done ahead of time, they all sit down in chairs in a circle and talk.I sneak up to the door and listen, and I nearly die to keep from laughing.Do you want to know what they talk?It’s like this.They don’t say a word for a long time.And then one says, “Thank God I’m not feeble-minded.”And all the rest nod their heads and look pleased.And then nobody says anything for a time.After which the next girl in the circle says, “Thank God I’m not feeble-minded,” and they nod their heads all over again.And it goes on around the circle, and they never say anything else.Now they’re real feebs, ain’t they?I leave it to you.I’m not that kind of a feeb, thank God."
"有时我觉得自己根本就不是弱智。我在乐队里演奏，还识乐谱。在这个乐队里，所有的人都应该是弱智，除了乐队指挥。他是个疯子。我们都知道，但我们不说，除非是私下里讨论。他的工作也是政治，我们不希望他失业。我是打鼓手。这个机构没有我就无法运转。我以前生过一次病，所以我知道。我住院期间这间弱智病房没有塌掉，真是个奇迹。","Sometimes I don’t think I’m a feeb at all.I play in the band and read music.We’re all supposed to be feebs in the band except the leader.He’s crazy.We know it, but we never talk about it except amongst ourselves.His job is politics, too, and we don’t want him to lose it.I play the drum.They can’t get along without me in this institution.I was sick once, so I know.It’s a wonder the drooling ward didn’t break down while I was in hospital."
"我如果想离开这里就能离开。我没有某些人想得那么无能。但我没有和别人说。我在这里过得太畅快了。再说，我要是跑了，一切都得垮掉。我担心某天他们发现我不是个弱智的时候，会把我送到外边，让我自谋生路。我了解外边的世界，我并不喜欢。对我来说，“家”已经相当不错了。","I could get out of here if I wanted to.I’m not so feeble as some might think.But I don’t let on.I have too good a time.Besides, everything would run down if I went away.I’m afraid some time they’ll find out I’m not a feeb and send me out into the world to earn my own living.I know the world, and I don’t like it.The Home is fine enough for me."
"你看我会时不时地咧嘴笑。我情不自禁。但我可以假装咧嘴使劲笑。虽然我并不坏。我看着玻璃中的自己。我的嘴长得很滑稽，这我自己知道，而且还往下垂，我的牙齿也不好。无论在哪里，光看一个人的嘴和牙齿你就能知道他是不是弱智。但那并不能证明我就是个弱智。只是我很幸运，我看起来像个弱智。","You see how I grin sometimes.I can’t help that.But I can put it on a lot.I’m not bad, though.I look at myself in the glass.My mouth is funny, I know that, and it lops down, and my teeth are bad.You can tell a feeb anywhere by looking at his mouth and teeth.But that doesn’t prove I’m a feeb.It’s just because I’m lucky that I look like one."
"我知道得多了。如果我告诉你我知道的一切，你一定会大吃一惊。可是在我不想知道，或者是不愿做他们让我做的事情的时候，我就把嘴往下耷拉，哈哈大笑，制造愚蠢的噪音。我观察过低等弱智发出怪声的样子，我能骗过所有人。而且我能制造出各种各样的怪叫。有一天凯尔茜小姐骂我是傻子。她那时生气极了，我就是在那时愚弄她的。","I know a lot.If I told you all I know, you’d be surprised.But when I don’t want to know, or when they want me to do something I don’t want to do, I just let my mouth lop down and laugh and make foolish noises.I watch the foolish noises made by the low-grades, and I can fool anybody.And I know a lot of foolish noises.Miss Kelsey called me a fool the other day.She was very angry, and that was where I fooled her."
"有一回凯尔茜小姐问我为什么不写一本关于弱智的书。我当时正和她说着小艾伯特的情况。你知道，他是个嘴角总流着口水的弱智，我总能从他眨巴左眼的方式看出他有什么毛病。所以我就给凯尔茜小姐是怎么回事，可就因为她自己不知道，她发火了。不过有一天，也许啊，我会写那么一本书。就是写书太麻烦了。再者，我宁愿用嘴说。","Miss Kelsey asked me once why I don’t write a book about feebs.I was telling her what was the matter with little Albert.He’s a drooler, you know, and I can always tell the way he twists his left eye what’s the matter with him.So I was explaining it to Miss Kelsey, and, because she didn’t know, it made her mad.But some day, mebbe, I’ll write that book.Only it’s so much trouble.Besides, I’d sooner talk."
"你知道“小头”是什么吗？就是那种脑袋比拳头还小的人。他们通常都是总流着口水，而且他们活得比较久。大头不会总流口水。他们脑袋很大，而且他们更聪明。但他们无法长大成人。他们总是会夭亡。我每次看到这样的人都会想，他就要死了。有时，我心神倦怠，或是护士正生我的气，我就希望自己也是个弱智，什么都不用做，还有人给我喂饭吃。但我觉得自己还是宁愿能说话，做我自己。","Do you know what a micro is?It’s the kind with the little heads no bigger than your fist.They’re usually droolers, and they live a long time.The hydros don’t drool.They have the big heads, and they’re smarter.But they never grow up.They always die.I never look at one without thinking he’s going to die.Sometimes, when I’m feeling lazy, or the nurse is mad at me, I wish I was a drooler with nothing to do and somebody to feed me.But I guess I’d sooner talk and be what I am."
"昨天达尔林普尔医生才刚对我说：“汤姆，”他说道，“真不知道如果没有你，我该怎么办。”他应该知道的，毕竟他对一千个弱智发号施令已经有两年了。他之前的是沃特库姆医生。他们是被任命的，你知道。这是政治。我在这里见过许多许多的医生。我比他们任何一个来得都早。我在这个机构呆了二十五年了。不，我没有怨言。这个机构运作得不能再好了。","Only yesterday Doctor Dalrymple said to me, “Tom,” he said, “just don’t know what I’d do without you.”And he ought to know, seeing as he’s had the bossing of a thousand feebs for going on two years.Dr. Whatcomb was before him.They get appointed, you know.It’s politics.I’ve seen a whole lot of doctors here in my time.I was here before any of them.I’ve been in this institution twenty-five years.No, I’ve got no complaints.The institution couldn’t be run better."
"当个高级的弱智是小菜一碟。看看达尔林普尔医生吧。他有很多麻烦。他用政治手段保住了工作。没错，我们这些高级的弱智谈论政治。我们了解政治的方方面面，政治糟糕透了。这样一个机构本不该靠政治运营。看看达尔林普尔医生。他在这里两年了，学会了很多。然后政治就开始发挥作用了，把他弄了出去，又派了一个对弱智病人一无所知的新医生来。","It’s a snap to be a high-grade feeb.Just look at Doctor Dalrymple.He has troubles.He holds his job by politics.You bet we high-graders talk politics.We know all about it, and it’s bad.An institution like this oughtn’t to be run on politics.Look at Doctor Dalrymple.He’s been here two years and learned a lot.Then politics will come along and throw him out and send a new doctor who don’t know anything about feebs."
"我在这里认识了成千上万个护士。他们中有的人不错。但是他们来了又走。大部分女护士都结了婚。有时候我觉得自己想要结婚。我跟沃特库姆医生说过一次，但他说自己非常抱歉，因为弱智是不允许结婚的。我曾经恋爱过。她是个护士。我不会告诉你她的名字的。她长着一双蓝色的眼睛，金黄的头发，说话很温柔，而且她喜欢我。她是这么和我说的。她还总是告诉我要做个乖男孩。而且我确实是个乖男孩，直到后来，我逃跑了。你瞧，她走了，然后结婚了，都没有告诉我。","I’ve been acquainted with just thousands of nurses in my time.Some of them are nice.But they come and go.Most of the women get married.Sometimes I think I’d like to get married.I spoke to Dr. Whatcomb about it once, but he told me he was very sorry, because feebs ain’t allowed to get married.I’ve been in love.She was a nurse. I won’t tell you her name.She had blue eyes, and yellow hair, and a kind voice, and she liked me.She told me so.And she always told me to be a good boy.And I was, too, until afterward, and then I ran away.You see, she went off and got married, and she didn’t tell me about it."
"我认为结婚不像人们吹捧得那么好。安格林医生和他的妻子过去常常吵架。我曾经看见他们争吵。而且有一次，我听见她骂他是弱智。听着，没有人有权利管不是弱智的人叫弱智。她那么叫他的时候，安格林医生非常生气。但是他并没有呆多久。政治把他赶了出去，曼德维尔医生就来了。他没有妻子。有一次，我听见他跟工程师交谈。工程师和他的妻子吵得鸡犬不宁，于是那天曼德维尔医生告诉他，自己很开心没有被女人的衬裙拴住。衬裙就是一种裙子。就算我是个弱智，我也明白他的意思。但是不能泄露这点。只要你不说出去，就能听到更多。","I guess being married ain’t what it’s cracked up to be.Dr. Anglin and his wife used to fight.I’ve seen them.And once I heard her call him a feeb.Now nobody has a right to call anybody a feeb that ain’t.Dr. Anglin got awful mad when she called him that.But he didn’t last long.Politics drove him out, and Doctor Mandeville came.He didn’t have a wife.I heard him talking one time with the engineer.The engineer and his wife fought like cats and dogs, and that day Doctor Mandeville told him he was damn glad he wasn’t tied to no petticoats.A petticoat is a skirt.I knew what he meant, if I was a feeb.But never let on.You hear lots when you don’t let on."
"我在这里已经看到许多事情了。有一次我被收养了，我坐着火车去了一个四十英里外的地方，和一个叫彼得·博普的男人和他的老婆一起生活。他们有个大农场。安格林医生说我既强壮又聪明，我也是这么说的。那是因为我想被收养。彼得·博普说他愿意给我一个温馨的家，而律师办妥了相关文件。","I’ve seen a lot in my time.Once I was adopted, and went away on the railroad over forty miles to live with a man named Peter Bopp and his wife.They had a ranch.Doctor Anglin said I was strong and bright, and I said I was, too.That was because I wanted to be adopted.And Peter Bopp said he’d give me a good home, and the lawyers fixed up the papers."
"但我很快就拿定主意，农场不是我的栖身之所。博普太太被我吓得要死，不让我在屋子里睡觉。他们修理了柴房，让我睡在那里。我必须四点起床喂马、挤牛奶，然后把牛奶送到邻居家里。他们管这个叫零工杂务，但我却会忙活一整天。我劈木柴，然后清理鸡舍，给蔬菜除草，几乎做了农场上所有的事。我过得一点都不快活。我没有一点闲暇。","But I soon made up my mind that a ranch was no place for me.Mrs. Bopp was scared to death of me and wouldn’t let me sleep in the house.They fixed up the woodshed and made me sleep there.I had to get up at four o’clock and feed the horses, and milk cows, and carry the milk to the neighbours.They called it chores, but it kept me going all day.I chopped wood, and cleaned chicken houses, and weeded vegetables, and did most everything on the place.I never had any fun.I hadn’t no time."
"让我告诉你一件事。比起在结霜的地上挤牛奶，我更愿意给弱智喂玉米粥和牛奶。博普太太害怕让我跟她的孩子们玩。而且我也害怕。四下无人的时候，他们常常冲我做鬼脸，骂我是“疯子”。每个人都叫我疯子汤姆。街坊四邻的其他男孩子都冲我扔石头。在“家”你不会看到那样的景象。弱智们更守规矩。","Let me tell you one thing.I’d sooner feed mush and milk to feebs than milk cows with the frost on the ground.Mrs. Bopp was scared to let me play with her children.And I was scared, too.They used to make faces at me when nobody was looking, and call me “Looney.”Everybody called me Looney Tom.And the other boys in the neighbourhood threw rocks at me.You never see anything like that in the Home here.The feebs are better behaved."
"博普太太嫌我动作慢时，常常会掐我，还扯我的头发，而我只是弄出愚蠢的噪音，然后做得更慢。她说哪天她会死在我的手里。我没把牧场上那口老井的木板盖盖上，然后一只小牛犊掉进井里淹死了。然后，彼得·博普说他要抽我一顿。他也这么做了。他拿起一条缰头皮带就冲着我来了。太可怕了。我这辈子从没挨过鞭子。他们在“家”不会这样做，这就是我为什么说“家”才是适合我的地方。我懂法律，我知道他没有权利用缰头皮带鞭打我。那是很残忍的，监护人文件上说他不能残忍地对待被监护人。我什么都没说。我只是等着，从这里你就能看出我是个什么样的弱智。我等了很久，做事更慢了，而且还制造出更多愚蠢的噪音；但他都不肯放我回“家”，那才是我想要的。不过一天，正好是那个月的第一天，布朗太太给了我三美金，是她付给彼得·博普的牛奶钱。那会儿是早上。等晚上拿回牛奶时，我应该把收据一起带回来。但我没有。我只是往市中心的车站走去，和其他人一样买了张票，然后上了回“家”的火车。我就是这样的弱智。","Mrs. Bopp used to pinch me and pull my hair when she thought I was too slow, and I only made foolish noises and went slower.She said I’d be the death of her some day.I left the boards off the old well in the pasture, and the pretty new calf fell in and got drowned.Then Peter Bopp said he was going to give me a licking.He did, too.He took a strap halter and went at me.It was awful.I’d never had a licking in my life.They don’t do such things in the Home, which is why I say the Home is the place for me.I know the law, and I knew he had no right to lick me with a strap halter.That was being cruel, and the guardianship papers said he mustn’t be cruel.I didn’t say anything.I just waited, which shows you what kind of a feeb I am.I waited a long time, and got slower, and made more foolish noises; but he wouldn’t send me back to the Home, which was what I wanted.But one day, it was the first of the month, Mrs. Brown gave me three dollars, which was for her milk bill with Peter Bopp.That was in the morning.When I brought the milk in the evening I was to bring back the receipt.But I didn’t.I just walked down to the station, bought a ticket like any one, and rode on the train back to the Home.That’s the kind of a feeb I am."
"那时安格林医生已经离开，曼德维尔接替了他的职位。我径直走进了他的办公室。他不认识我。“你好，”他说，“今天不是接待日。”“我不是来拜访的，”我说，“我是汤姆。我属于这里。”然后他发出嘘声，表现出大吃一惊的样子。我告诉了他一切，给他看了缰绳皮带留下的伤痕，于是他越来越愤怒，说他会处理彼得·博普德这档子事的。","Doctor Anglin was gone then, and Doctor Mandeville had his place.I walked right into his office.He didn’t know me.“Hello,” he said, “this ain’t visiting day.”“I ain’t a visitor,” I said.“I’m Tom.I belong here.”Then he whistled and showed he was surprised.I told him all about it, and showed him the marks of the strap halter, and he got madder and madder all the time and said he’d attend to Mr. Peter Bopp’s case."
"也许你觉得有些流着口水的小弱智不高兴见到我。","And mebbe you think some of them little droolers weren’t glad to see me."
"我径直走进病房。有个新来的护士正在喂艾伯特吃饭。“等一等，”我说，“不应该这么喂。你看不见他是怎么眨巴左眼的么？让我来给你做个示范。”也许她以为我是新来的医生，因为她马上就把勺子给我了。我喂饱了小艾伯特，我猜这是我离开之后，小艾伯特吃的最舒服的一顿饭。只要你了解了这些弱智，你就会发现他们并不坏。有一次，我听见琼斯小姐跟凯尔茜小姐说，我在应付总流口水的弱智病人方面，有惊人的天赋。","I walked right into the ward.There was a new nurse feeding little Albert.“Hold on,” I said.“That ain’t the way.Don’t you see how he’s twisting that left eye?Let me show you.”Mebbe she thought I was a new doctor, for she just gave me the spoon, and I guess I filled little Albert up with the most comfortable meal he’d had since I went away.Droolers ain’t bad when you understand them.I heard Miss Jones tell Miss Kelsey once that I had an amazing gift in handling droolers."
"有一天，也许我会和达尔林普尔医生谈谈，让他宣布我不是弱智。然后我会让他使我成为一个弱智病房里的真正的助手，每个月四十美金，还提供食宿。然后我会娶琼斯小姐，在这里继续生活。如果她不肯嫁给我，我就娶凯尔茜小姐，或者其他的哪个护士。这里有好多想结婚的护士呢。如果我的妻子发火的时候骂我弱智，我是不会在意的。在意有什么用？我料想，一个人要是学会了忍受弱智病人，忍受一个妻子不会难到哪里去吧。","Some day, mebbe, I’m going to talk with Doctor Dalrymple and get him to give me a declaration that I ain’t a feeb.Then I’ll get him to make me a real assistant in the drooling ward, with forty dollars a month and my board.And then I’ll marry Miss Jones and live right on here.And if she won’t have me, I’ll marry Miss Kelsey or some other nurse.There’s lots of them that want to get married.And I won’t care if my wife gets mad and calls me a feeb.What’s the good?And I guess when one’s learned to put up with droolers a wife won’t be much worse."
"我还没有告诉你，我逃跑时的事。我从来没想过要逃跑，这件事完全是查利和乔唆我的。你知道，他们是高级的弱智病人。那会儿，我去楼上给威尔逊医生的办公室稍了个口信，在我正打算回弱智病房的时候，看见查利和乔躲在健身房的角落里，向我做手势。我向他们走过去。","I didn’t tell you about when I ran away.I hadn’t no idea of such a thing, and it was Charley and Joe who put me up to it.They’re high-grade epilecs, you know.I’d been up to Doctor Wilson’s office with a message, and was going back to the drooling ward, when I saw Charley and Joe hiding around the corner of the gymnasium and making motions to me.I went over to them."
"“你好，”乔说，“那些总流口水的病人情况怎么样？”","“Hello,” Joe said.“How’s droolers?”"
"“挺好的，”我说，“最近抽风了吗？”","“Fine,” I said.“Had any fits lately?”"
"他们听了很生气，在我正要继续说话的时候，乔说，“我们要逃跑。一起走吧。”","That made them mad, and I was going on, when Joe said, “We’re running away.Come on.”"
"“为什么？”我说。","“What for?” I said."
"“我们要爬到山顶上去。”乔说。","“We’re going up over the top of the mountain,” Joe said."
"“然后发现一个金矿，”查利说，“我们就不会再抽风了。我们就会痊癒。”","“And find a gold mine,” said Charley.“We don’t have fits any more.We’re cured.”"
"“好吧。”我说。我们蹑手蹑脚地绕到健身房的后面，进入了树林。也许走了大概十分钟的时候，我停下了。","“All right,” I said.And we sneaked around back of the gymnasium and in among the trees.Mebbe we walked along about ten minutes, when I stopped."
"“怎么了？”乔说。","“What’s the matter?” said Joe."
"“等一下，”我说，“我得回去。”","“Wait,” I said.“I got to go back.”"
"“为什么？”乔说。","“What for?” said Joe."
"我回答道：“去把小艾伯特带上。”","And I said, “To get little Albert.”"
"他们说我不能这么做，还生气了。但我不在乎。我知道他们会等我的。你看，我在这里呆了二十五年了，我知道背面通向山的小路，而查利和乔却不知道。这就是他们想和我一起逃的原因。","And they said I couldn’t, and got mad.But I didn’t care.I knew they’d wait.You see, I’ve been here twenty-five years, and I know the back trails that lead up the mountain, and Charley and Joe didn’t know those trails.That’s why they wanted me to come."
"于是我回去带上了小艾伯特。他不能走路，不能说话，除了流口水之外什么都不会做，我只能把他抱在怀里。我们继续前行，经过了最后一片干草地，那是我去过最远的地方。之后，树木和灌木丛变得十分茂密，我也找不到任何小径，我们就顺着牛的足迹往下来到了一条小河边，然后翻过了“家”土地尽头的栅栏。","So I went back and got little Albert.He can’t walk, or talk, or do anything except drool, and I had to carry him in my arms.We went on past the last hayfield, which was as far as I’d ever gone.Then the woods and brush got so thick, and me not finding any more trail, we followed the cow-path down to a big creek and crawled through the fence which showed where the Home land stopped."
"我们爬上河对面的大山。山上全是大树，没有灌木丛，但山上落满了枯叶，又陡又滑，我们几乎寸步难行。不久我们就来到了一个真正糟糕的地方。那个地方只有四十英尺宽，一不小心就会摔到一千英尺以下，亦或是一百英尺以下。但是无论如何，你不会直接摔下去——只是滑下去罢了。我带着小艾伯特第一个过去的。紧接着是乔。但查利刚走了一半就害怕得坐了下来。","We climbed up the big hill on the other side of the creek.It was all big trees, and no brush, but it was so steep and slippery with dead leaves we could hardly walk.By and by we came to a real bad place.It was forty feet across, and if you slipped you’d fall a thousand feet, or mebbe a hundred.Anyway, you wouldn’t fall—just slide.I went across first, carrying little Albert.Joe came next.But Charley got scared right in the middle and sat down."
"“我要抽风了。”他说。","“I’m going to have a fit,” he said."
"“不，你不会的，”乔说，“因为如果你要抽风的话，你就不会坐下来了。你一直都是站着抽风的。”","“No, you’re not,” said Joe.“Because if you was you wouldn’t ’a’ sat down.You take all your fits standing.”"
"“这次抽风不一样。”查利说着说着就开始哭了起来。","“This is a different kind of a fit,” said Charley, beginning to cry."
"他不停地抖动着自己的身体，但正因为他想要把自己吓得抽风，他一点也抽不起来。","He shook and shook, but just because he wanted to he couldn’t scare up the least kind of a fit."
"乔急了，张口就骂。但一点作用也没有。于是我用柔和亲切的声调劝说查利。这才是对待弱智的办法。如果你发火，他们的情况只会更糟。我知道。我自己就是那样的。这就是为什么博普太太几乎要被我气死了。因为她对我发脾气。就快到下午了，我知道我们得继续上路了，所以我对乔说：","Joe got mad and used awful language.But that didn’t help none.So I talked soft and kind to Charley.That’s the way to handle feebs.If you get mad, they get worse.I know.I’m that way myself.That’s why I was almost the death of Mrs. Bopp.She got mad.It was getting along in the afternoon, and I knew we had to be on our way, so I said to Joe:"
"“过来，别骂了，抱着艾伯特。我过去把他带过来。”","“Here, stop your cussing and hold Albert.I’ll go back and get him.”"
"我也确实带他过来了；但他害怕极了，头晕眼花的，在我的帮助下，他才手脚并用地爬了过来。我把他弄过来之后，又抱起了艾伯特，这时我听见有人大笑，于是就朝下看。一对男女坐在马背上抬头看我们。那个男人的马鞍上别着把枪，而哈哈大笑的是那个女人。","And I did, too; but he was so scared and dizzy he crawled along on hands and knees while I helped him.When I got him across and took Albert back in my arms, I heard somebody laugh and looked down.And there was a man and woman on horseback looking up at us.He had a gun on his saddle, and it was her who was laughing."
"“到底是谁？”乔有些惊慌地问，“有人来抓我们？”","“Who in hell’s that?” said Joe, getting scared.“Somebody to catch us?”"
"“闭上你的臭嘴。”我对他说，“那个男人是这片农场的主人，他还写书。”","“Shut up your cussing,” I said to him.“That is the man who owns this ranch and writes books.”"
"“你好啊，恩迪科特先生。”我往下冲着他说。","“How do you do, Mr. Endicott,” I said down to him."
"“你好，”他说，“你们在这干什么呢？”","“Hello,” he said.“What are you doing here?”"
"“我们在逃跑。”我说。","“We’re running away,” I said."
"于是他说：“祝你好运，但一定要在天黑之前回去。”","And he said, “Good luck.But be sure and get back before dark.”"
"“但我们这次真的要逃跑。”我说。","“But this is a real running away,” I said."
"接着，他和他的妻子大笑起来。","And then both he and his wife laughed."
"“好吧，”他说，“还是祝你们好运。但天黑的时候小心狗熊和美洲狮，别让它们捉住你们。”","“All right,” he said.“Good luck just the same.But watch out the bears and mountain lions don’t get you when it gets dark.”"
"然后他们大笑着骑马离开了，很开心的样子；但我想他要是没说狗熊和美洲狮的事就好了。","Then they rode away laughing, pleasant like; but I wished he hadn’t said that about the bears and mountain lions."
"转过这座山之后，我们发现了一条小路，于是我们加快了脚步。查利不再有要抽风的迹象，却开始笑着谈论金矿。麻烦的是小艾伯特。他的个头几乎跟我一样大。你看，一直以来我都叫他小艾伯特，但他在慢慢长大。他太沉了，我都跟不上乔和查利了。我当时上气不接下气。因此我告诉他们必须轮流背他，他们却说他们不愿意。于是我说如果我把他们丢下，他们就会迷路，美洲狮和狗熊就会吃掉他们。查利看起来当场就要抽风了，而乔说：“把他给我吧。”之后，我们就开始轮流背小艾伯特。","After we got around the hill, I found a trail, and we went much faster.Charley didn’t have any more signs of fits, and began laughing and talking about gold mines.The trouble was with little Albert.He was almost as big as me.You see, all the time I’d been calling him little Albert, he’d been growing up.He was so heavy I couldn’t keep up with Joe and Charley.I was all out of breath.So I told them they’d have to take turns in carrying him, which they said they wouldn’t.Then I said I’d leave them and they’d get lost, and the mountain lions and bears would eat them.Charley looked like he was going to have a fit right there, and Joe said, “Give him to me.”And after that we carried him in turn."
"我们接着向上爬。我觉得这里没有什么金矿，但是如果当时我们没有迷路，天没有黑，也没有因为小艾伯特而累得精疲力尽的话，我们也许已经到达了山顶，找到了金矿。许多弱智都怕黑，乔说他要在那里抽风了。只不过他并没有抽风。我从来没见过这么不幸的男孩。他想抽风的时候从来没有抽过风。有的弱智一眨眼的工夫就能抽好几次风。","We kept right on up that mountain.I don’t think there was any gold mine, but we might ’a’ got to the top and found it, if we hadn’t lost the trail, and if it hadn’t got dark, and if little Albert hadn’t tired us all out carrying him.Lots of feebs are scared of the dark, and Joe said he was going to have a fit right there.Only he didn’t.I never saw such an unlucky boy.He never could throw a fit when he wanted to.Some of the feebs can throw fits as quick as a wink."
"不久天就黑了，我们也饿了，但我们没有火。你看，他们不让弱智带火柴，我们所能做的只是发抖。我们从来没有考虑到会挨饿。你看，弱智总是吃现成的饭菜，这就是为什么当个弱智比靠自己维持生计要好。","By and by it got real black, and we were hungry, and we didn’t have no fire.You see, they don’t let feebs carry matches, and all we could do was just shiver.And we’d never thought about being hungry.You see, feebs always have their food ready for them, and that’s why it’s better to be a feeb than earning your living in the world."
"最糟糕的事情，就是安静。而有一件比这还糟的事，那就是声音。每安静一会儿就会响起各种各样的声响。我觉得是兔子的声音，但灌木丛里发出的响动却像是野兽——你知道，沙沙声，砰砰声，撞击声，劈啪声，诸如此类。先是查利抽了次风，这次是真的，然后是乔，他抽得很厉害。在“家”的时候，大家都在一起，我不介意有人抽风。但是漆黑的夜里，身处树林中就不一样了。你听我说，不要跟弱智病人一起去找金矿，即使他们是高级病人。","And worse than everything was the quiet.There was only one thing worse, and it was the noises.There was all kinds of noises every once in a while, with quiet spells in between.I reckon they were rabbits, but they made noises in the brush like wild animals—you know, rustle rustle, thump, bump, crackle crackle, just like that.First Charley got a fit, a real one, and Joe threw a terrible one.I don’t mind fits in the Home with everybody around.But out in the woods on a dark night is different.You listen to me, and never go hunting gold mines with epilecs, even if they are high-grade."
"这是我度过的最可怕的一夜。乔和查利不抽风时，他们就假装抽风，在黑暗中我看不清楚，冷得发抖在我看来也像是在抽风。我也抖得厉害，我甚至以为自己也抽风了。小艾伯特没有东西吃，只是不停地流口水。我从没见过他的情况那么糟糕。哎呀，他那只左眼被眨巴得都要掉出来了。我看不见，但我能从他的动作看出来。乔只是躺在地上骂呀骂的，而查利则哭着希望回到“家”去。","I never had such an awful night.When Joe and Charley weren’t throwing fits they were making believe, and in the darkness the shivers from the cold which I couldn’t see seemed like fits, too.And I shivered so hard I thought I was getting fits myself.And little Albert, with nothing to eat, just drooled and drooled.I never seen him as bad as that before.Why, he twisted that left eye of his until it ought to have dropped out.I couldn’t see it, but I could tell from the movements he made.And Joe just lay and cussed and cussed, and Charley cried and wished he was back in the Home."
"我们没有死，第二天早上沿着原路返回了。小艾伯特沉得不得了。威尔逊医生恼怒得不得了，说我、乔还有查利是这个机构里最坏的弱智。但那时弱智病房的护士斯特赖克小姐只是抱着我大哭。我回来了她是那么高兴。就在那时我想也许我会娶她。但是仅仅一个月过后，她就嫁给了从市里过来修理新医院排水沟的水管工。小艾伯特有两天都没眨巴他的左眼，他的眼睛太累了。","We didn’t die, and next morning we went right back the way we’d come.And little Albert got awful heavy.Doctor Wilson was mad as could be, and said I was the worst feeb in the institution, along with Joe and Charley.But Miss Striker, who was a nurse in the drooling ward then, just put her arms around me and cried, she was that happy I’d got back.I thought right there that mebbe I’d marry her.But only a month afterward she got married to the plumber that came up from the city to fix the gutter-pipes of the new hospital.And little Albert never twisted his eye for two days, it was that tired."
"下一次逃跑，我要直接翻过那座山。但我不会和弱智病人同行了。他们无可救药，只要一害怕或是一兴奋就会猛烈地抽搐。但我会带着小艾伯特一起走。不知道为什么，我离开他就无法生活。不管怎样，我不准备逃走了。弱智病房比金矿要好，而且我听说有一个新护士要来。另外，小艾伯特现在比我的个头还要大，我不能抱着他翻山越岭了。他每一天都在长大。这真让人惊讶。","Next time I run away I’m going right over that mountain.But I ain’t going to take epilecs along.They ain’t never cured, and when they get scared or excited they throw fits to beat the band.But I’ll take little Albert.Somehow I can’t get along without him.And, anyway, I ain’t going to run away.The drooling ward’s a better snap than gold mines, and I hear there’s a new nurse coming.Besides, little Albert’s bigger than I am now, and I could never carry him over a mountain.And he’s growing bigger every day.It’s astonishing."
