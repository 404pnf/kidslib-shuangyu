		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在瑞士小镇沃韦，有一家特别舒适的旅店。实际上，这里有许多旅店，因为接待旅行者是当地最主要的行业。正如许多游客一定会记住的那样，小镇坐落在一条湖畔，湖水尤其蓝——而正是这片湖水吸引着每一位游客的到来。湖岸边整齐地排列着一排各式旅店，从最新式的“大饭店”，到旧时小巧别致的瑞士食宿公寓。大饭店都装有一扇粉笔白的正门和上百个阳台，十几面旗子从楼顶飘下。而瑞士公寓则将它的名字用看起来像德文字母的字体刻在一面粉色或黄色的墙壁上，花园的角落里还安放了一座不伦不类的凉亭。然而，在沃韦镇的诸多旅店里，有一家颇负盛名，甚至堪称经典，以其奢华、成熟的气派在相邻的暴发户中显得出类拔萃。六月份，这一地区的美国游客数不胜数。的确可以这么说，韦沃镇在这个季节具备美国温泉胜地的诸多特点。有一些景象和声音会使人想到纽波特和萨拉托加的情景和声音。时髦的年轻姑娘迈着轻快的脚步到处穿梭，平纹细布裙子的荷叶边发出沙沙的声音；上午的几个小时里有欢闹的舞曲，整天都能听到人们的尖叫声。你在美丽的三冠酒店对这些事物产生印象后，你的想象力会把你带到海洋大厦或国会大厅。但必须补充的是，在三冠酒店，其他的一些特点与这些联想截然不同：穿着整洁的德国服务生，看上去像德国公使馆的秘书；坐在花园里的俄罗斯公主；手牵着手、由家庭教师陪着四处散步的波兰男孩们；阳光灿烂的南峰峰顶的景色，以及风景如画的希永城堡塔楼。</td>
		<td class="en">At the little town of Vevey, in Switzerland, there is a particularly comfortable hotel.There are, indeed, many hotels, for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place, which, as many travelers will remember, is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake—a lake that it behooves every tourist to visit.The shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order, of every category, from the “grand hotel” of the newest fashion, with a chalk-white front, a hundred balconies, and a dozen flags flying from its roof, to the little Swiss pension of an elder day, with its name inscribed in German-looking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden.One of the hotels at Vevey, however, is famous, even classical, being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity.In this region, in the month of June, American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said, indeed, that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American watering place.There are sights and sounds which evoke a vision, an echo, of Newport and Saratoga.There is a flitting hither and thither of “stylish” young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces, a rattle of dance music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched voices at all times.You receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the “Trois Couronnes” and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to Congress Hall.But at the “Trois Couronnes,” it must be added, there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions: neat German waiters, who look like secretaries of legation; Russian princesses sitting in the garden; little Polish boys walking about held by the hand, with their governors; a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两三年前，一个年轻的美国人坐在三冠酒店的花园里，相当悠闲地四处打量着我先前提到的优雅景致。我几乎不知道他想到的最多的是相同之处，还是不同之处。那是一个美丽的夏天的早晨，这个年轻的美国人无论用什么方式看待事物，这些事物对他而言肯定是迷人的。前一天他乘坐小汽船从日内瓦来看望住在酒店的姑妈。他在日内瓦住了很长时间。可是他的姑妈正患头疼——他姑妈几乎总是头疼——现在她把自己关在房间里，闻着樟脑油，因而他就能四处去逛逛。他大约二十七岁，他的朋友们说起他时，通常会说他在日内瓦“学习”。他的仇人们说起他时，会说——不过话说回来，他根本没有仇人，他是个特别和蔼可亲的人，受到大家的喜欢。简而言之，我应该说的是当某些人说起他时，他们断言，他在日内瓦呆那么长时间是因为他非常倾心于一个住在那儿的小姐——一位外国小姐——一位比他年长的小姐。很少有美国人——实际上我认为没有一个美国人——曾经见过这位小姐，关于她却有一些奇异的故事。但是，温特博恩对加尔文派的这个小小的中心城市有一种由来已久的感情；还是个小男孩的时候他就被送到那儿上学，随后又在那儿上大学，这些经历他在年轻的时候就结下了许多友谊。他一直与很多人保持着友谊，对于他来说，友谊是巨大满足感的来源。</td>
		<td class="en">I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American, who, two or three years ago, sat in the garden of the “Trois Couronnes,” looking about him, rather idly, at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned.It was a beautiful summer morning, and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things, they must have seemed to him charming.He had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer, to see his aunt, who was staying at the hotel—Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence.But his aunt had a headache—his aunt had almost always a headache—and now she was shut up in her room, smelling camphor, so that he was at liberty to wander about.He was some seven-and-twenty years of age; when his friends spoke of him, they usually said that he was at Geneva “studying.”When his enemies spoke of him, they said—but, after all, he had no enemies; he was an extremely amiable fellow, and universally liked.What I should say is, simply, that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there—a foreign lady—a person older than himself.Very few Americans—indeed, I think none—had ever seen this lady, about whom there were some singular stories.But Winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism; he had been put to school there as a boy, and he had afterward gone to college there—circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships.Many of these he had kept, and they were a source of great satisfaction to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >敲了敲姑妈的门，知道她不舒服之后，他就去小镇上四处转悠了，然后回来吃早饭。现在他吃完了早饭，正喝着一小杯咖啡，这杯咖啡是一位看上去像使馆馆员的服务生给他端到花园的小桌上的。最后，他喝完咖啡，点了一支烟。一会儿，一个小男孩儿沿着小径走来——一个九岁或十岁左右的淘气鬼。对于他的年龄而言，他显得有些矮小，但脸上透露出的却是大人的表情：脸色苍白，轮廓鲜明。他穿着灯笼裤和红色长筒袜，露出两条像车轴一样细得可怜的小腿；他还系着一条亮红色的领巾。他手里拿着一根长长的登山杖，并用尖锐的杖尖刺进他接近的每件东西——花坛、花园的长凳、女士们连衣裙的拖裙。在温特博恩面前，他停了下来，用一双明亮的、富有穿透力的小眼睛看着他。</td>
		<td class="en">After knocking at his aunt’s door and learning that she was indisposed, he had taken a walk about the town, and then he had come in to his breakfast.He had now finished his breakfast; but he was drinking a small cup of coffee, which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache.At last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette.Presently a small boy came walking along the path—an urchin of nine or ten.The child, who was diminutive for his years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale complexion, and sharp little features.He was dressed in knickerbockers, with red stockings, which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks; he also wore a brilliant red cravat.He carried in his hand a long alpenstock, the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approached—the flowerbeds, the garden benches, the trains of the ladies’ dresses.In front of Winterbourne he paused, looking at him with a pair of bright, penetrating little eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你能给我一块糖吗？”他用尖锐刺耳的小嗓音问道——嗓音不够成熟，然而不知为什么，也并不年轻。</td>
		<td class="en">“Will you give me a lump of sugar?” he asked in a sharp, hard little voice—a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温特博恩瞥了一眼他旁边的小桌子，上面摆放着他的咖啡器皿，他看到上面还留着几小块糖。“行，你可以拿一块，”他答道，“可我觉得吃糖对小男孩没好处。”</td>
		<td class="en">Winterbourne glanced at the small table near him, on which his coffee service rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained.“Yes, you may take one,” he answered; “but I don’t think sugar is good for little boys.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个小男孩走上前，仔细挑选出了三块让他垂涎欲滴的糖块，两块塞进灯笼裤的口袋里，还有一块迅速地放到另一个地方。他将长矛式的登山杖插进温特博恩的长凳里，然后试图用牙咬碎糖块。</td>
		<td class="en">This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments, two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers, depositing the other as promptly in another place.He poked his alpenstock, lance-fashion, into Winterbourne’s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢！该死！好——硬！”他大喊道，用一种奇怪的方式发出这个形容词的音。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, blazes; it’s har-r-d!” he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温特博恩立刻察觉到，他可以荣幸地声称男孩是自己的同胞。“小心，不要伤到你的牙齿。”他说，像个父亲一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman.“Take care you don’t hurt your teeth,” he said, paternally.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我没有牙齿可以伤到了。它们全掉了。我只有七颗牙。昨晚我妈妈数过了，之后一颗牙又掉了。她说如果牙再掉就会扇我耳光。我也没办法。就因为这个老朽的欧洲。这里的气候使我的牙掉了。在美国它们没掉过。就因为这些旅店。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I haven’t got any teeth to hurt.They have all come out.I have only got seven teeth.My mother counted them last night, and one came out right afterward.She said she’d slap me if any more came out.I can’t help it.It’s this old Europe.It’s the climate that makes them come out.In America they didn’t come out.It’s these hotels.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温特博恩觉得非常好玩。“如果你吃下三块糖，你妈妈肯定会扇你耳光。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">Winterbourne was much amused.“If you eat three lumps of sugar, your mother will certainly slap you,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那她就得给我一些糖果。”他的年轻交谈者回答。“在这里我找不到任何糖果——任何美国糖果。美国糖果是最好的糖果。”</td>
		<td class="en">“She’s got to give me some candy, then,” rejoined his young interlocutor.“I can’t get any candy here—any American candy.American candy’s the best candy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那美国的小男孩是最好的小男孩吗？”温特博恩问。</td>
		<td class="en">“And are American little boys the best little boys?” asked Winterbourne.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不知道。我是个美国男孩。”孩子说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t know.I’m an American boy,” said the child.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我看你是最好的男孩之一！”温特伯恩大笑。</td>
		<td class="en">“I see you are one of the best!” laughed Winterbourne.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是美国男人吗？”这个活泼的小孩追问道。然后，听到温特伯恩的肯定回答后，他大声宣布：“美国男人是最好的男人！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you an American man?” pursued this vivacious infant.And then, on Winterbourne’s affirmative reply—“American men are the best,” he declared.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩的伙伴对他的恭维话表示了感谢，男孩此时已经跨在登山杖上，一边站着四处张望，一边咬着第二块糖。温特博恩不知道自己小时候是否也是这样，因为在差不多这个年龄的时候，他已经被带来欧洲了。</td>
		<td class="en">His companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had now got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he attacked a second lump of sugar.Winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy, for he had been brought to Europe at about this age.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我姐姐来了！”一会儿，这孩子喊道。“她是个美国女孩儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here comes my sister!” cried the child in a moment.“She’s an American girl.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温特博恩沿着小径望去，看到一位年轻漂亮的小姐正在走来。“美国女孩是最好的女孩！”他愉快地对他的小伙伴说。</td>
		<td class="en">Winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing.“American girls are the best girls,” he said cheerfully to his young companion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我姐姐不是最好的！”孩子宣称，“她总是冲我发火。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My sister ain’t the best!” the child declared.“She’s always blowing at me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我猜那是你的错，不是她的错。”温特博恩说。与此同时，年轻小姐已经走近了。她身穿白色平纹细布裙，裙上有上百个褶皱和荷叶边，还有一些浅色的缎带结。她没戴帽子，但手里拿着一把大阳伞，伞上有绣花的宽边，她非常漂亮，引人注目，让人很是喜欢。“她们好漂亮啊！”温特博恩想，在椅子上直起身，好像他准备站起来的样子。</td>
		<td class="en">“I imagine that is your fault, not hers,” said Winterbourne.The young lady meanwhile had drawn near.She was dressed in white muslin, with a hundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon.She was bareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep border of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty.“How pretty they are!” thought Winterbourne, straightening himself in his seat, as if he were prepared to rise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻小姐在他的长凳前停下来。长凳离花园栏杆很近，正对着湖水。小男孩现在已经将登山杖变成了撑杆，借助它的帮助，在砂砾地上四处跳跃，踢起了很多砂砾。</td>
		<td class="en">The young lady paused in front of his bench, near the parapet of the garden, which overlooked the lake.The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“伦道夫，”年轻小姐说，“你在干什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Randolph,” said the young lady, “what ARE you doing?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我在登阿尔卑斯山，”伦道夫回答，“就是这样登山的！”他又蹦了一下，将砾石溅到了温特伯恩的耳朵周围。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m going up the Alps,” replied Randolph.“This is the way!”And he gave another little jump, scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne’s ears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是人们下山的方法，”温特博恩说。</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s the way they come down,” said Winterbourne.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是个美国男人！”伦道夫用尖锐的小嗓音喊道。</td>
		<td class="en">“He’s an American man!” cried Randolph, in his little hard voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻小姐并没有注意这句话，而是直盯着他的弟弟看。“好了，我想你最好安静一下。”她简短地说了一句。</td>
		<td class="en">The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight at her brother.“Well, I guess you had better be quiet,” she simply observed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在温特博恩看来，他似乎已经以某一种方式被人作了介绍。他站起身，缓慢走向年轻女孩，还扔掉了他的香烟。“这个小男孩和我已经认识了。”他很有礼貌地说。他非常清楚地意识到，在日内瓦，一个年轻男子不能随便和一个年轻的未婚女子说话，除非是某些极个别的特殊场合；但这里是沃韦，还有什么情况比现在更好呢？——在花园里，一个漂亮的美国姑娘来了并站在你的面前。然而，听到温特博恩的话，这个漂亮的美国姑娘只是瞥了他一眼，随后她就转过头，目光越过栏杆，看着湖水和对面的山。他不知道自己是否做得过分了，但决定必须前进，而不是后退。他正在考虑说点别的话，年轻小姐又一次转向小男孩。</td>
		<td class="en">It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented.He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his cigarette.“This little boy and I have made acquaintance,” he said, with great civility.In Geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions could be better than these?—a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden.This pretty American girl, however, on hearing Winterbourne’s observation, simply glanced at him; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the opposite mountains.He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he decided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat.While he was thinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little boy again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想知道你是在哪儿得到那根杆的。”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I should like to know where you got that pole,” she said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我买的。”伦道夫回答。</td>
		<td class="en">“I bought it,” responded Randolph.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不是想说你要把它带到意大利吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You don’t mean to say you’re going to take it to Italy?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，我要把它带到意大利。”孩子宣布。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, I am going to take it to Italy,” the child declared.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻姑娘扫了一眼自己裙子的前面，把一两个缎带结弄平了。而后她的目光再次落到景色上。“好了，我想你最好把它留在某个地方。”过了片刻，她说道。</td>
		<td class="en">The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon.Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again.“Well, I guess you had better leave it somewhere,” she said after a moment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们要去意大利吗？”温特博恩用一种十分恭敬的语气询问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you going to Italy?” Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻小姐又瞥了他一眼。“是的，先生。”她回答。接着她又不说话了。</td>
		<td class="en">The young lady glanced at him again.“Yes, sir,” she replied.And she said nothing more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们……要……翻越辛普朗山吗？”温特博恩继续问，稍有点尴尬。</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you—a—going over the Simplon?”Winterbourne pursued, a little embarrassed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不知道。”她说，“我想是某座山吧。伦道夫，我们打算翻越什么山？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t know,” she said.“I suppose it’s some mountain.Randolph, what mountain are we going over?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去哪儿？”孩子问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Going where?” the child demanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去意大利。”温特博恩解释。</td>
		<td class="en">“To Italy,” Winterbourne explained.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不知道。”伦道夫说，“我不想去意大利。我想去美国。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t know,” said Randolph.“I don’t want to go to Italy.I want to go to America.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，意大利是个美丽的地方！”年轻人再次加入谈话。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, Italy is a beautiful place!” rejoined the young man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在那儿能买到糖果吗？”伦道夫大声询问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Can you get candy there?” Randolph loudly inquired.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我希望买不到。”他姐姐说，“我想你已经吃了足够多的糖果了，妈妈也这么认为。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I hope not,” said his sister.“I guess you have had enough candy, and mother thinks so too.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我已经好长时间没吃了——有一百个星期了！”男孩嚷嚷，还在到处蹦蹦跳跳。</td>
		<td class="en">“I haven’t had any for ever so long—for a hundred weeks!” cried the boy, still jumping about.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻小姐仔细看了看她的荷叶边，再次将她的缎带结抚平；片刻后，温特博恩冒险大胆地对美丽的景色作了评论。他不再感到尴尬，因为他开始意识到，她本人一点也不尴尬。她迷人的面容一点也没有变化，很明显她既没有生气，也没有觉得受到奉承。如果他和她说话，她却看着别处，似乎没有特别听他说话，这仅仅是她的习惯、她的方式而已。然而，当他多讲了一点，并指出视野内一些有趣的但似乎她很陌生的物体时，她开始逐渐向他投去了更多的目光；这时他发现这种目光相当直接和坚定。然而，这不是所谓的不庄重的目光，因为这年轻姑娘的眼睛异常地诚实和单纯。那是美丽绝伦的眼睛。事实上，温特博恩已经很长时间没有看到过比他的这位美丽的女同胞五官更漂亮的了——她的面容，她的鼻子，她的耳朵，还有她的牙齿。他非常喜爱女性的美，他痴迷于观察和分析美。关于这位年轻女士的脸，观察后他做了几点总结。她的脸也不是没有味道，可就是没有恰到好处地表现出来；尽管非常精致，但温特博恩心里还是指责它——非常仁慈地——不完美。他想，很可能伦道夫少爷的姐姐是个卖弄风情的女人，他确信她有自己的性格，可是在她亮丽、甜美、肤浅的小脸上，没有嘲弄，没有讽刺。很快，有一点就变得很明显了，她其实非常乐于交谈。她告诉他，他们打算去罗马过冬——她，她母亲，和伦道夫。她问他是否是“真正的美国人”；她不该把他当作一个美国人，他看起来更像德国人——这是稍稍犹豫后说的——尤其是当他说话的时候。温特博恩大笑着回答，他遇到过说话像美国人的德国人，但在他的记忆范围内，他还没有遇到过说话像德国人的美国人。然后，他问她，如果她坐在他刚刚离开的长凳上，是不是会更舒服一点。她回答说，她喜欢站着或者到处走走，但很快她还是坐下了。她告诉他，她来自纽约州——“如果你知道它在哪儿的话。”温特博恩抓住她瘦小、跑来跑去的弟弟，让他在自己身边站了几分钟，于是了解到更多有关她的情况。</td>
		<td class="en">The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again; and Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view.He was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself.There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered.If she looked another way when he spoke to her, and seemed not particularly to hear him, this was simply her habit, her manner.Yet, as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view, with which she appeared quite unacquainted, she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking.It was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance, for the young girl’s eyes were singularly honest and fresh.They were wonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman’s various features—her complexion, her nose, her ears, her teeth.He had a great relish for feminine beauty; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it; and as regards this young lady’s face he made several observations.It was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and though it was eminently delicate, Winterbourne mentally accused it—very forgivingly—of a want of finish.He thought it very possible that Master Randolph’s sister was a coquette; he was sure she had a spirit of her own; but in her bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was no mockery, no irony.Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation.She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter—she and her mother and Randolph.She asked him if he was a “real American”; she shouldn’t have taken him for one; he seemed more like a German—this was said after a little hesitation—especially when he spoke.Winterbourne, laughing, answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met an American who spoke like a German.Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted.She answered that she liked standing up and walking about; but she presently sat down.She told him she was from New York State—“if you know where that is.”Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small, slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“告诉我你的名字，小朋友。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Tell me your name, my boy,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“伦道夫·Ｃ. 米勒！”男孩尖声说。“我告诉你她的名字。”他用登山杖对准他姐姐。</td>
		<td class="en">“Randolph C. Miller,” said the boy sharply.“And I’ll tell you her name”; and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你最好等到别人问你的时候再说！”这位年轻小姐平静地说。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两天后，他和她去了希永城堡。他在旅馆的大厅等她，那里的侍从、仆人、外国游客正四处转悠并盯着他们看呢。要他选，他就不会选这里，但是她指定了这里。她轻快地走下楼来，穿着美丽的、素净优雅的旅行服，合拢的阳伞紧贴着美丽的身体，她边走边系着长手套上的纽扣。温特博恩想象力很丰富，正如我们的祖先过去说的，是一个敏感的人。当他看着她的穿着，看着她迈着利索自信的脚步走下宽大的楼梯时，他感觉有什么浪漫的事情要发生了。他可能还相信他将要和她私奔。他和她经过了聚集在那里的所有闲散的人，他们都使劲盯着她看；她一见到他就开始聊了起来。温特博恩本来更愿意坐马车去希永，但是她非常希望能坐小汽船去，她说她特别喜欢汽船。水上总是微风阵阵，让人心情愉快。附近有很多的游客。航程不长，可是温特博恩的同伴在这段时间里说了许多的事。对于小伙子自己来说，他们的小小旅程能算是一次出轨行为——一场冒险，即便考虑到她自由惯了，他也还是希望她也是这么想的。可是，不得不承认，尤其在这一点上，他失望了。戴西·米勒极其活跃，她精神愉悦，可是很明显她一点也不兴奋、不激动；她不会避开他的目光，也不避开任何其他人的目光；她看他的时候不脸红，她感觉到人们在看她的时候也不脸红。人们一直看她，温特博恩从他漂亮同伴那独特的气质中获得了很大的满足。他之前有点害怕她会大声讲话，笑得太多，甚至可能想要在船上到处走动。但是他很快就忘记了他的顾虑；他坐在那儿微笑着，目光停留在她的脸上，而她在座位上一动不动，发表着自己许许多多的新奇想法。这是他曾听到过的最迷人的闲聊。他曾经认同她有点“粗俗”的看法，可是，她真的是这样，还是他只是习惯了她的粗俗？她所说的东西主要是玄学家称为客观的那类事物，不过偶尔地，也会说些主观的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">Two days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon.He waited for her in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the servants, the foreign tourists, were lounging about and staring.It was not the place he should have chosen, but she had appointed it.She came tripping downstairs, buttoning her long gloves, squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure, dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume.Winterbourne was a man of imagination and, as our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he looked at her dress and, on the great staircase, her little rapid, confiding step, he felt as if there were something romantic going forward.He could have believed he was going to elope with her.He passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there; they were all looking at her very hard; she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him.Winterbourne’s preference had been that they should be conveyed to Chillon in a carriage; but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer; she declared that she had a passion for steamboats.There was always such a lovely breeze upon the water, and you saw such lots of people.The sail was not long, but Winterbourne’s companion found time to say a great many things.To the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapade—an adventure—that, even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom, he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way.But it must be confessed that, in this particular, he was disappointed.Daisy Miller was extremely animated, she was in charming spirits; but she was apparently not at all excited; she was not fluttered; she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her.People continued to look at her a great deal, and Winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companion’s distinguished air.He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about the boat a good deal.But he quite forgot his fears; he sat smiling, with his eyes upon her face, while, without moving from her place, she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections.It was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard.he had assented to the idea that she was “common”; but was she so, after all, or was he simply getting used to her commonness?Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a subjective turn.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们登上去以后，在城堡里，主观的因素无疑占了优势。戴西在拱形房间里轻快地到处跑着，她的裙子在螺旋形楼梯上沙沙地响。她在地牢旁边战栗了一下，有点卖弄风情地很动人地轻声叫了一声，并且转过异常漂亮的耳朵，倾听温特博恩给她讲这个地方的所有事情。但他看出来她对封建古迹并不感兴趣，希永城堡的幽暗历史也没给她留下什么印象。他们运气好，能够四处走动，除了管理员没有其他游客；温特博恩已经和这个管理员说好，管理员不会催他们，只要他们想去哪里，他们都可以随意走动和停留。管理员对他们的要求欣然答应，温特博恩这边也很是大方，最后就剩他们两个单独游览。米勒小姐谈话的逻辑性并不突出，对于任何她想说的事情，她肯定会找个托辞。在希永城堡崎岖不平的墙垛里，她找了大量的托辞，接着突然问起有关温特博恩的问题——他的家庭，他以前的经历，他的品味，他的习惯，他的计划等，并且也提供了她自己相应的信息。米勒小姐准备好用最明确最有利于她自己的方式来描述她自己的品味、习惯和计划。</td>
		<td class="en">In the castle, after they had landed, the subjective element decidedly prevailed.Daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers, rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases, flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes, and turned a singularly well-shaped ear to everything that Winterbourne told her about the place.But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon her.They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian; and Winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried—that they should linger and pause wherever they chose.The custodian interpreted the bargain generously—Winterbourne, on his side, had been generous—and ended by leaving them quite to themselves.Miss Miller’s observations were not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext.She found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking Winterbourne sudden questions about himself—his family, his previous history, his tastes, his habits, his intentions—and for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality.Of her own tastes, habits, and intentions Miss Miller was prepared to give the most definite, and indeed the most favorable account.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“The last!” cried the young girl; “I call it the first.I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone.”And for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid.Poor Winterbourne was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements.His companion, after this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of Chillon or the beauties of the lake; she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see.How did Miss Daisy Miller know that there was a charmer in Geneva?Winterbourne, who denied the existence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage.She seemed to him, in all this, an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity.“Does she never allow you more than three days at a time?” asked Daisy ironically.“Doesn’t she give you a vacation in summer?There’s no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season.I suppose, if you stay another day, she’ll come after you in the boat.Do wait over till Friday, and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive!”Winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked.If he had missed the personal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance.It sounded very distinctly, at last, in her telling him she would stop “teasing” him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in the winter.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温特伯恩急于证实自己的礼貌，而年轻姑娘也亲切地允许他陪她。他们在米勒夫人之前下了楼，在门口，温特伯恩看到米勒夫人的马车来到了近前，还有那个他在沃韦就结识的衣着光鲜的侍从。“再见，尤金尼奥！”戴西大声说，“我打算去散步。”从维亚·格雷戈里亚娜大街到品奇欧山另一端的美丽花园之间的路程实际上非常短。然而，因为天气很好，车辆、行人十分拥堵，漫步的人也很多，年轻的美国人发现他们的行程被耽搁了。对于这个事实，温特伯恩倒是很乐意，尽管他也意识到了他的尴尬处境。那群行进缓慢、目光悠然的罗马人把注意力集中在这个极为美丽的年轻外国小姐身上，她正挽着他的胳膊穿过人群；他想知道，当戴西提出要无人陪伴，暴露在人群中时，她的脑子里究竟在想什么。在她看来，他自己的任务很明显就是把她交给乔万内里先生；可是温特伯恩立刻感到既恼怒又满足，决定不做这样的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">Winterbourne’s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her.They passed downstairs before her mother, and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs. Miller’s carriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at Vevey seated within.“Goodbye, Eugenio!” cried Daisy; “I’m going to take a walk.”The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is, in fact, rapidly traversed.As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found their progress much delayed.This fact was highly agreeable to Winterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation.The slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in Daisy’s mind when she proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation.His own mission, to her sense, apparently, was to consign her to the hands of Mr. Giovanelli; but Winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified, resolved that he would do no such thing.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戴西明显具有做介绍的天赋；她向她的同伴们提及了彼此的名字。她缓缓地走着，身旁分别是两位同伴；英语说得非常讨巧的乔万内里先生——温特伯恩后来听说他在很多美国女继承人面前练习过这类用语——和她说了大量的客气的废话；他极其地温文尔雅，年轻的美国人什么也没说，却琢磨着意大利式聪明的奥妙，这种聪明能使人在越感到失望的时候表现得越有礼貌。乔万内里当然指望更加亲密一些，他没预料到会是一个三个人的聚会。可是他用一种意味深长的方式克制住了他的脾气。温特伯恩自以为认清了他的把戏。“他不是个绅士，”年轻美国人说，“他只是个聪明的绅士模仿者。他是个音乐教师，或穷文人，或是一个三流艺术家。让他的好相貌见鬼去吧！”当然，乔万内里先生有一副非常漂亮的面孔，但让温特伯恩感到无比愤怒的是他自己可爱的女同胞不知道一个假绅士和一个真绅士之间的差别。乔万内里又说又笑，使自己显得非常容易相处。的确是这样，如果他是个模仿者，他的模仿确实很出色。“然而，”温特伯恩对自己说，“一个好女孩应该知道的！”接着他又回到这个问题：事实上，她是不是个好女孩呢？一个好女孩，就算可以有点美国式的卖弄风骚，会和一个想必下流的外国人约会吗？诚然他们的约会是在大白天罗马最拥挤的角落里进行的，可是说他们选择这里是为了表现极端的玩世不恭也不是不可能。也许看起来很奇怪，温特伯很恼火这个年轻姑娘在会见情人时并没有对他自己的陪伴显得不耐烦，他还对自己的一厢情愿感到很恼火。不可能把她看作是个行为很端正的年轻小姐；她缺少某种不可或缺的优雅气质。要是能够将她当作言情作家所称的“感情上无法无天”的人对待，那问题就会简化了。她要是希望摆脱他，就会让他更加轻视她，要是一旦能轻视她，就会使得她不那么令人困惑了。可是戴西在这一场合的表现还是不可思议地将厚颜无耻和天真无邪融为了一体。</td>
		<td class="en">Daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions; she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other.She strolled alone with one of them on each side of her; Mr. Giovanelli, who spoke English very cleverly—Winterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses—addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense; he was extremely urbane, and the young American, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed.Giovanelli, of course, had counted upon something more intimate; he had not bargained for a party of three.But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions.Winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure.“He is not a gentleman,” said the young American; “he is only a clever imitation of one.He is a music master, or a penny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist.Damn his good looks!”Mr. Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face; but Winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman’s not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one.Giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable.It was true that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant.“Nevertheless,” Winterbourne said to himself, “a nice girl ought to know!”And then he came back to the question whether this was, in fact, a nice girl.Would a nice girl, even allowing for her being a little American flirt, make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner?The rendezvous in this case, indeed, had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome, but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism?Singular though it may seem, Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl, in joining her amoroso, should not appear more impatient of his own company, and he was vexed because of his inclination.It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy.It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers “lawless passions.”That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her, and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing.But Daisy, on this occasion, continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Since Winterbourne was not to meet her in Mrs. Walker’s drawing room, he went as often as possible to Mrs. Miller’s hotel.The ladies were rarely at home, but when he found them, the devoted Giovanelli was always present.Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room with Daisy alone, Mrs. Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance.Winterbourne noted, at first with surprise, that Daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance; but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him; the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect.She showed no displeasure at her tete-a-tete with Giovanelli being interrupted; she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always, in her conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility.Winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in Giovanelli, it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews; and he liked her the more for her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor.He could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous.At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the reader’s part, I may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to Winterbourne among the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be afraid—literally afraid—of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of Daisy Miller.It must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to Daisy; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with a sort of relief.It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisy’s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read.She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect.He stood there, looking at her—looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have been more brightly visible.He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller.Then, as he was going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the fear that he was doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism.He turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he heard Daisy speak again.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">What a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at injured innocence!But he wouldn’t cut her.Winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross.Daisy had got up; Giovanelli lifted his hat.Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria.What if she WERE a clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa.“How long have you been here?” he asked almost brutally.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Daisy followed with Winterbourne.He kept looking at her; she seemed not in the least embarrassed.Winterbourne said nothing; Daisy chattered about the beauty of the place.“Well, I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight!” she exclaimed.“That’s one good thing.”Then, noticing Winterbourne’s silence, she asked him why he didn’t speak.He made no answer; he only began to laugh.They passed under one of the dark archways; Giovanelli was in front with the carriage.Here Daisy stopped a moment, looking at the young American.“DID you believe I was engaged, the other day?” she asked.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Winterbourne, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that he had encountered Miss Miller, at midnight, in the Colosseum with a gentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little American circle, and commented accordingly.Winterbourne reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after Daisy’s return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver.But the young man was conscious, at the same moment, that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little American flirt should be “talked about” by low-minded menials.These people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the little American flirt was alarmingly ill.Winterbourne, when the rumor came to him, immediately went to the hotel for more news.He found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were being entertained in Mrs. Miller’s salon by Randolph.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就是因为晚上到处乱跑，”伦道夫说，“这就是她生病的原因。她总是在晚上到处乱逛。我觉得她不该去，天黑得要命。在这里，晚上你什么都看不见，除非有月亮的时候。在美国总是有月亮的！”没有看见米勒夫人，她现在至少也该是在陪伴着她的女儿。很明显，戴西病得很严重。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s going round at night,” said Randolph—“that’s what made her sick.She’s always going round at night.I shouldn’t think she’d want to, it’s so plaguy dark.You can’t see anything here at night, except when there’s a moon.In America there’s always a moon!”Mrs. Miller was invisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of her society.It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温特伯恩经常去问询她的消息，有一次他见到了米勒夫人，让他惊讶的是，她虽然十分担忧，却极为镇静，而且看上去还是位高效、干练的护士。她讲了很多有关戴维斯医生的话，可是温特伯恩还是向她表示了问候，并对自己说，毕竟她不是个荒谬的傻瓜。“戴西有一天说起你了。”她对他说，“有半数时间她不知道她在说什么，可是那次，我想她知道。她要我给你捎个口信。她要我告诉你说，她从未和那个英俊的意大利人订过婚。我肯定我非常高兴；自从她生病以来，乔万内里先生从没来过我们这儿。我原以为他真是个绅士；可是我觉得那样非常不礼貌！一位女士告诉我说，他害怕我会因为他带戴西晚上出去而生他的气。唉，我是生气，可是我想他知道我是位有身份的女士呀。我才不屑于去责骂他。无论怎样，她说她没有订婚。我不知道她为什么想让你知道，但是她和我说了三次：‘你一定告诉温特伯恩先生。’然后，她让我问问你，你是否记得在瑞士的那次去古堡的事。可是我说，我不愿传达任何这样的口信。只是，如果她没有订婚的话，我确信我很高兴知道这事。”</td>
		<td class="en">Winterbourne went often to ask for news of her, and once he saw Mrs. Miller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise, perfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious nurse.She talked a good deal about Dr. Davis, but Winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such a monstrous goose.“Daisy spoke of you the other day,” she said to him.“Half the time she doesn’t know what she’s saying, but that time I think she did.She gave me a message she told me to tell you.She told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian.I am sure I am very glad; Mr. Giovanelli hasn’t been near us since she was taken ill.I thought he was so much of a gentleman; but I don’t call that very polite!A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking Daisy round at night.Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I’m a lady.I would scorn to scold him.Anyway, she says she’s not engaged.I don’t know why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times, ‘Mind you tell Mr. Winterbourne.’And then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland.But I said I wouldn’t give any such messages as that.Only, if she is not engaged, I’m sure I’m glad to know it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，正如温特伯恩说的，这已经不重要了。此后一个星期，这个可怜的姑娘死了，那是一场可怕的热病。戴西的坟墓在小小的新教墓地里，在罗马皇宫城墙的一个角落里，在柏树和密集的迎春花下面。温特伯恩和很多其他送葬者站在墓旁，送葬者的数量超过你的预想，虽然这只是一个一生都传出流言蜚语的年轻姑娘。他的身旁站着乔万内里，在温特伯恩转身离开前，他凑了过来。乔万内里脸色很苍白，在这个场合他的钮孔里没插鲜花，他似乎想说点什么。最后，他说：“她是我见过的最漂亮的姑娘，而且是最亲切的姑娘。”之后，他又加上了一句，“她还是最天真的姑娘。”</td>
		<td class="en">But, as Winterbourne had said, it mattered very little.A week after this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever.Daisy’s grave was in the little Protestant cemetery, in an angle of the wall of imperial Rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers.Winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other mourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady’s career would have led you to expect.Near him stood Giovanelli, who came nearer still before Winterbourne turned away.Giovanelli was very pale: on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish to say something.At last he said, “She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw, and the most amiable”; and then he added in a moment, “and she was the most innocent.”</td></tr>
