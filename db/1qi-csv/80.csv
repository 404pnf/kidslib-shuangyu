"闪光的金子","The Gold That Glittered"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"一个带有某种寓意的故事，就像是蚊子的细长口器。它使你厌烦，然后又往你的皮肤里注进刺激性液体，使你良心不安。因此，我们先以寓意为上，来看看寓意。不是所有发光的物体都是金子，但是聪明的孩子知道把盛有试金酸溶液的瓶子上的塞子塞紧了。","A story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito.It bores you, and then injects a stinging drop to irritate your conscience.Therefore let us have the moral first and be done with it.All is not gold that glitters, but it is a wise child that keeps the stopper in his bottle of testing acid."
"百老汇和华盛顿广场交界的那一角是小里亚托剧院区。这里站着那儿的演员们，这就是他们的陈词滥调：“‘没门儿’，我对弗罗曼说，‘周薪一百，少一点儿也不行。’然后我就走开了。”","Where Broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by George the Veracious is the Little Rialto.Here stand the actors of that quarter, and this is their shibboleth: “‘Nit,’ says I to Frohman, ‘you can’t touch me for a kopeck less than two-fifty per,’ and out I walks.”"
"在这个倍受瞩目的剧院的西侧和南侧有一两条街道是说西班牙语的美国人的聚居地，他们在这个寒冷刺骨的北方，聚集在一块儿，寻求一点点热带的温暖。这个地区的主要活动中心就是“庇护所”，一个咖啡馆兼餐馆，来满足那些来自南方的居无定所的流亡人员的需要。来自智利、玻利维亚、哥伦比亚、绵延起伏的中美洲共和国和愤怒的西印度群岛的那些穿斗篷、戴墨西哥阔边帽的人们，就像本国政治火山大爆炸喷射出的燃烧的岩浆一样散落到这里。在这里他们研究对策、等待时机、寻求资助，招募那些勇于献身的人，偷运军火和弹药，准备打持久仗。在“庇护所”，他们找到了发展壮大所需要的环境。","Westward and southward from the Thespian glare are one or two streets where a Spanish-American colony has huddled for a little tropical warmth in the nipping North.The centre of life in this precinct is “El Refugio,” a café and restaurant that caters to the volatile exiles from the South.Up from Chili, Bolivia, Colombia, the rolling republics of Central America and the ireful islands of the Western Indies flit the cloaked and sombreroed señores, who are scattered like burning lava by the political eruptions of their several countries.Hither they come to lay counterplots, to bide their time, to solicit funds, to enlist filibusterers, to smuggle out arms and ammunitions, to play the game at long taw.In El Refugio, they find the atmosphere in which they thrive."
"“庇护所”餐馆里提供的食品能满足所有人的胃口。利他主义一定会终止这个如此之长的故事。但有必要继续说一点，用餐的人，厌倦了法国大厨师的手艺的人们啊，美味召唤你来到“庇护所”！只有在这里你才能找到某种用西班牙方式烘焙的鱼——青鱼、美国西鲱或者来自海湾的鲹鱼。番茄给予其色彩、特性和灵魂；科罗拉多的红辣椒赐予它风味、独特和热情；不知名的药草带来刺激与神秘；还有——它是无比荣耀的，需要有专门的介绍。在它的周围、它的上方、它的下面、它的附近——但不是里面——弥漫着一种似有似无的气味，一种臭气，如此稀薄而又微妙，只有物理研究协会才会知道它的起源。在“庇护所”，不要说鱼里面加了大蒜。不是别的，就好像是大蒜的精魂，翩翩飞过去，给那道最上面是欧芹的菜一个迟迟不离去的飞吻，就像现实生活中一样，你自作多情地认为，那个给别人的吻印在了你的唇上，并在那里萦绕不绝。然后，当名叫康齐托的侍者给你端来一碟褐色菜豆和一玻璃瓶波尔图葡萄酒的时候——啊，上帝啊！","In the restaurant of El Refugio are served compounds delightful to the palate of the man from Capricorn or Cancer.Altruism must halt the story thus long.On, diner, weary of the culinary subterfuges of the Gallic chef, hie thee to El Refugio!There only will you find a fish—bluefish, shad or pompano from the Gulf—baked after the Spanish method.Tomatoes give it color, individuality and soul; chili Colorado bestows upon it zest, originality and fervor; unknown herbs furnish piquancy and mystery, and—but its crowning glory deserves a new sentence.Around it, above it, beneath it, in its vicinity—but never in it—hovers an ethereal aura, an effluvium so rarefied and delicate that only the Society for Psychical Research could note its origin.Do not say that garlic is in the fish at El Refugio.It is not otherwise than as if the spirit of Garlic, flitting past, has wafted one kiss that lingers in the parsley-crowned dish as haunting as those kisses in life, “by hopeless fancy feigned on lips that are for others.”And then, when Conchito, the waiter, brings you a plate of brown frijoles and a carafe of wine that has never stood still between Oporto and El Refugio—ah, Dios!"
"一天，一艘汉堡—美国的邮轮在55号码头靠岸。佩里科·齐梅内斯·比利亚布兰卡·法尔孔将军，一个来自卡塔赫纳的乘客，在这里下了船。将军的肤色介于陶土色和栗色之间，42英寸的腰围，加上他的高跟马靴，身高共为5.4英尺。他留着射击场老板一样的胡须，穿着一身像是得克萨斯州的议会议员的衣服，活像一个没有被委派任务的代表。","One day a Hamburg-American liner deposited upon Pier No. 55 Gen. Perrico Ximenes Villablanca Falcon, a passenger from Cartagena.The General was between a claybank and a bay in complexion, had a 42-inch waist and stood 5 feet 4 with his Du Barry heels.He had the mustache of a shooting-gallery proprietor, he wore the full dress of a Texas congressman and had the important aspect of an uninstructed delegate."
"法尔孔将军懂的英文仅够他去询问去往“庇护所”的路。当他走到附近的时候，他看到一个体面的红砖房子前有一个招牌，上面写着：“西班牙旅馆”。窗户上有一个用西班牙语书写的告示：“本店只讲西班牙语”。这个将军进去了，确定这里就是那个最合适的避风港。","Gen. Falcon had enough English under his hat to enable him to inquire his way to the street in which El Refugio stood.When he reached that neighborhood he saw a sign before a respectable red-brick house that read, “Hotel Español.”In the window was a card in Spanish, “Aqui se habla Español.”The General entered, sure of a congenial port."
"在这个舒适的办公室里坐着的是奥布赖恩女士，这里的老板娘。她有着金色的头发，哦，那无与伦比的金色秀发。除此之外，她也和蔼可亲，长得白白胖胖。法尔孔将军的阔边帽子扫过地板，他说了一些西班牙语，音节听起来像一串鞭炮沿着一根火药引线轻轻地爆炸。","In the cozy office was Mrs. O’Brien, the proprietress.She had blond—oh, unimpeachably blond hair.For the rest she was amiability, and ran largely to inches around.Gen. Falcon brushed the floor with his broad-brimmed hat, and emitted a quantity of Spanish, the syllables sounding like firecrackers gently popping their way down the string of a bunch."
"“西班牙人还是意大利人？”奥布赖恩女士亲切地问道。","“Spanish or Dago?” asked Mrs. O’Brien, pleasantly."
"“我是哥伦比亚人，女士。”这个将军自豪地说，“我说西班牙语。您窗户上的告示说，这里只能说西班牙语。那是怎么回事呢？”","“I am a Colombian, madam,” said the General, proudly.“I speak the Spanish.The advisement in your window say the Spanish he is spoken here.How is that?”"
"“哦，您现在说的就是西班牙语，不是吗？”女士答道，“我可不会说。”","“Well, you’ve been speaking it, ain’t you?” said the madam.“I’m sure I can’t.”"
"在这个西班牙旅店，法尔孔将军订了房间，安顿下来。在黄昏的时候，他在街上散步，想好好看看这个喧闹的北方城市的奇观。他走路的时候想着那位奥布赖恩女士的完美金发。“在这里，”将军对自己说，毫无疑问他用的是他本国的语言，“人们可以找到世界上最美的女人。我以前在哥伦比亚见到的所有美女中，谁都没有如此美丽。是的，没有！但法尔孔将军现在不应该想美人。我所挚爱的应当是我的国家。”","At the Hotel Español General Falcon engaged rooms and established himself.At dusk he sauntered out upon the streets to view the wonders of this roaring city of the North.As he walked he thought of the wonderful golden hair of Mme. O’Brien.“It is here,” said the General to himself, no doubt in his own language, “that one shall find the most beautiful señoras in the world.I have not in my Colombia viewed among our beauties one so fair.But no!It is not for the General Falcon to think of beauty.It is my country that claims my devotion.”"
"在百老汇大街和小里亚托剧院交汇的转角处，将军被卷入车流。街上的车使他很困惑，其中一辆车的挡泥板刮到了他，使他撞上了一个满装着橘子的手推车。一辆出租马车的轮毂差点擦到他，车夫大骂了他一顿。他蹒跚地走向人行道，当一个花生烘焙机的汽笛声嘶吼着钻进了他的耳朵的时候，他又一次吓得跳开了。“上帝救救我！这是什么鬼地方？”","At the corner of Broadway and the Little Rialto the General became involved.The street cars bewildered him, and the fender of one upset him against a pushcart laden with oranges.A cab driver missed him an inch with a hub, and poured barbarous execrations upon his head.He scrambled to the sidewalk and skipped again in terror when the whistle of a peanut-roaster puffed a hot scream in his ear.“Válgame Dios!What devil’s city is this?”"
"当将军像一只受伤的沙锥鸟从来来往往的人群里飞出来时，他同时被两个猎手当作猎物盯上了。其中一个是“土霸”麦圭尔，他强壮的手臂和他那八英寸的铅制管子是他的常用工具。另一个柏油马路上的好猎人就是“蜘蛛”凯利，一个用更文明一点的方法的人。","As the General fluttered out of the streamers of passers like a wounded snipe he was marked simultaneously as game by two hunters.One was “Bully” McGuire, whose system of sport required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eight-inch piece of lead pipe.The other Nimrod of the asphalt was “Spider” Kelley, a sportsman with more refined methods."
"当他们朝明摆着的猎物奔去时，凯利先生的身手稍显敏捷。他的肘部精确地挡住了麦圭尔先生的猛攻。","In pouncing upon their self-evident prey, Mr. Kelley was a shade the quicker.His elbow fended accurately the onslaught of Mr. McGuire."
"“走开！”他严肃地命令道，“我先看到他的！”麦圭尔偷偷地走了，被那出众的才能震慑住了。","“G’wan!” he commanded harshly.“I saw it first.”McGuire slunk away, awed by superior intelligence."
"“对不起，”凯利先生对将军说，“你刚才有点慌乱，是吗？让我来帮助你吧。”他捡起了这个将军的帽子，掸了掸上面的灰尘。","“Pardon me,” said Mr. Kelley, to the General, “but you got balled up in the shuffle, didn’t you?Let me assist you.”He picked up the General’s hat and brushed the dust from it."
"凯利先生的方式总是很奏效。这个将军被这个喧闹的大街弄得迷惑而沮丧，自然把他的拯救者当作一个最无私的骑士一样来欢迎。","The ways of Mr. Kelley could not but succeed.The General, bewildered and dismayed by the resounding streets, welcomed his deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested heart."
"“我想，”这个将军说道，“回到奥布赖恩的那个旅馆，我逗留的地方。天啊！先生，在这个纽约城里，吵闹声和快节奏的生活让人受不了。”","“I have a desire,” said the General, “to return to the hotel of O’Brien, in which I am stop.Caramba! señor, there is a loudness and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this Nueva York.”"
"彬彬有礼的凯利先生不允许这个高贵的哥伦比亚人面对独自回去的危险。他们在西班牙旅馆的门前停了下来。在街道的斜对面，一个不显眼的、有灯光照明的牌子上很低调地写着“庇护所”。凯利先生几乎没有不熟悉的地方，从外表就知道这是一个“意大利人俱乐部”。凯利先生把所有的外国人分成两类，意大利人和法国人。他对将军说，他们相见恨晚，应该去那里喝酒以便加深他们的感情。","Mr. Kelley’s politeness would not suffer the distinguished Colombian to brave the dangers of the return unaccompanied.At the door of the Hotel Español they paused.A little lower down on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated sign of El Refugio.Mr. Kelley, to whom few streets were unfamiliar, knew the place exteriorly as a “Dago joint.”All foreigners Mr. Kelley classed under the two heads of “Dagoes” and Frenchmen.He proposed to the General that they repair thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid foundation."
"一个小时后，法尔孔将军和凯利先生在“庇护所”阴谋家之角的一张桌子旁坐下了。他们中间摆放着瓶子和玻璃杯。这是这个将军第十次说出他来美国的秘密使命。他宣布道，他来到这里是为了购买军火——2000支温切斯特来复枪——给哥伦比亚的革命者用。他的口袋里装着卡塔赫纳银行在纽约代理商行签署的25000美元的汇票。在其他桌子上，其他的革命者也在向他们的同谋者大叫着他们的政治秘密，但是谁也没像这位将军这样大声。他用力敲着桌子；他吆喝着再来一些酒；他向他的朋友们咆哮着说他的任务是机密的，不能透露给任何活口。凯利先生被打动了，他热情高涨，深表同情。他的手伸过桌子，抓住了这位将军的手。","An hour later found General Falcon and Mr. Kelley seated at a table in the conspirator’s corner of El Refugio.Bottles and glasses were between them.For the tenth time the General confided the secret of his mission to the Estados Unidos.He was here, he declared, to purchase arms—2,000 stands of Winchester rifles—for the Colombian revolutionists.He had drafts in his pocket drawn by the Cartagena Bank on its New York correspondent for $25,000.At other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their fellow-plotters; but none was as loud as the General.He pounded the table; he hallooed for some wine; he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one, and not to be hinted at to a living soul.Mr. Kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm.He grasped the General’s hand across the table."
"“先生，”他诚挚地说道，“我不知道你的国家在哪儿，但我对它充满敬意。我猜它一定是美国的什么地方，因为，有时侯一些诗人和校园里的人也叫我们哥伦比亚人。今晚能见到我，对于你来说真的是很幸运。我是纽约唯一的一个能跟你做这桩枪支生意的人。美国国防部长是我最好的朋友。他现在就在这个城市，我明天就为了你去见他。在此期间，先生，你一定要保管好你口袋里的汇票啊。我明天会给你打电话的，然后带你去见他。喂！你说的不是哥伦比亚区吧，是不是？”凯利先生最后突然不安地说道。“你不可能只靠2000支枪来搞定——以前用多得多的枪都失败了。”","“Monseer,” he said, earnestly, “I don’t know where this country of yours is, but I’m for it.I guess it must be a branch of the United States, though, for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us Columbia, too, sometimes.It’s a lucky thing for you that you butted into me to-night.I’m the only man in New York that can get this gun deal through for you.The Secretary of War of the United States is me best friend.He’s in the city now, and I’ll see him for you to-morrow.In the meantime, monseer, you keep them drafts tight in your inside pocket.I’ll call for you to-morrow, and take you to see him.Say! that ain’t the District of Columbia you’re talking about, is it?” concluded Mr. Kelley, with a sudden qualm.“You can’t capture that with no 2,000 guns—it’s been tried with more.”"
"“不，不，不！”将军惊叫道，“它是哥伦比亚共和国——南美洲顶端的一个伟大的共和国。是的。是的。”","“No, no, no!” exclaimed the General.“It is the Republic of Colombia—it is a g-r-reat republic on the top side of America of the South.Yes.Yes.”"
"“那好吧，”凯利先生安心地说道，“现在我们各自回家，分开走。我今晚就给部长写信，跟他定一个时间。从纽约运出枪支是一件棘手的事情。麦克拉斯基本人都搞定不了。”","“All right,” said Mr. Kelley, reassured.“Now suppose we trek along home and go by-by.I’ll write to the Secretary to-night and make a date with him.It’s a ticklish job to get guns out of New York.McClusky himself can’t do it.”"
"他们在西班牙旅馆门口分开了。这个将军抬起头看看月亮，叹了一口气。","They parted at the door of the Hotel Español.The General rolled his eyes at the moon and sighed."
"“你们的纽约真是一个很大的地方。”他说道，“街上的汽车坏了这里的景致，炒坚果的机器非常糟地发出刺耳的声音。但是，啊，凯利先生，这里的女人有着金色的头发，丰满得恰到好处，她们太棒了！非常厉害！”","“It is a great country, your Nueva York,” he said.“Truly the cars in the streets devastate one, and the engine that cooks the nuts terribly makes a squeak in the ear.But, ah, Señor Kelley—the señoras with hair of much goldness, and admirable fatness—they are magnificas!Muy magnificas!”"
"凯利去最近的公用电话亭给麦克拉里酒馆打电话，这个酒馆在远处百老汇大街上的一个地方。他给吉米·邓恩打电话。","Kelley went to the nearest telephone booth and called up McCrary’s café, far up on Broadway.He asked for Jimmy Dunn."
"“是吉米·邓恩吗？”凯利问道。","“Is that Jimmy Dunn?” asked Kelley."
"“是的。”那边回答道。","“Yes,” came the answer."
"“你这个大骗子。”凯利高兴地说，“你是国防部长。在那里等我。我有最好的事情要告诉你，绝对是你所钓过的最大的鱼。这是一个周围有金色带子的科罗拉多雪茄烟，这是免费的优惠券，它足够买一展红色的大厅灯，还有一座小溪里伸长脖子的普赛克雕像。我马上就到。”","“You’re a liar,” sang back Kelley, joyfully.“You’re the Secretary of War.Wait there till I come up.I’ve got the finest thing down here in the way of a fish you ever baited for.It’s a Colorado-maduro, with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to buy a red hall lamp and a statuette of Psyche rubbering in the brook.I’ll be up on the next car.”"
"吉米·邓恩是骗子组织里的文学硕士。他曾经是很出色的骗子艺术家。他一生都没用过棍棒；他藐视那些用蒙汗药的人。事实上，如果他有可能在纽约遇到这样的事情，在害人之前，他除了单纯地让计划中的受害者喝很多酒以外什么都不会准备。“蜘蛛”凯利的雄心就是把自己提高到吉米的层次上来。","Jimmy Dunn was an A. M. of Crookdom.He was an artist in the confidence line.He never saw a bludgeon in his life; and he scorned knockout drops.In fact, he would have set nothing before an intended victim but the purest of drinks, if it had been possible to procure such a thing in New York.It was the ambition of “Spider” Kelley to elevate himself into Jimmy’s class."
"那天晚上，这两个绅士在麦克拉里进行了谈话。凯利作了解释。","These two gentlemen held a conference that night at McCrary’s.Kelley explained."
"“他像一个警探那样容易搞定。他来自哥伦比亚岛屿，那里正在发生一场罢工或者冲突之类的什么事情，他们派遣他来这里购买2000支温切斯特枪，来了断这件事情。他给我看了两张10000美元、一张5000美元的汇票，可以在这里的银行里取款。事实上，吉米，我真的被他弄疯了，因为他没有把它换成千元大钞放在银盘子里直接给我。现在，我们就只能等他去银行把钱给我们取出来。”","“He’s as easy as a gumshoe.He’s from the Island of Colombia, where there’s a strike, or a feud, or something going on, and they’ve sent him up here to buy 2,000 Winchesters to arbitrate the thing with.He showed me two drafts for $10,000 each, and one for $5,000 on a bank here.’S truth, Jimmy, I felt real mad with him because he didn’t have it in thousand-dollar bills, and hand it to me on a silver waiter.Now, we’ve got to wait till he goes to the bank and gets the money for us.”"
"他们谈了两个小时终于谈完了，然后邓恩说：“明天下午四点，让他到百老汇大街X号。”","They talked it over for two hours, and then Dunn said; “Bring him to No.—Broadway, at four o’clock to-morrow afternoon.”"
"凯利瞅准时机给西班牙旅馆打了个电话找将军。他发现这个狡猾的战士正忙着和奥布赖恩女士开心地聊天。","In due time Kelley called at the Hotel Español for the General.He found the wily warrior engaged in delectable conversation with Mrs. O’Brien."
"“国防部长等着我们呢。”凯利说。","“The Secretary of War is waitin’ for us,” said Kelley."
"这个将军依依不舍地离开了。","The General tore himself away with an effort."
"“唉，先生，”他叹了口气说道，“责任在身啊。但是，先生，这位纽约的女士是多么漂亮啊！简直堪称典范，这位奥布赖恩女士真是美人一个，如此令人沉醉！她就是女神级别的美女——她就是天后朱诺——一位长着大大的眼睛的天后朱诺！”","“Ay, señor,” he said, with a sigh, “duty makes a call.But, señor, the señoras of your Estados Unidos—how beauties!For exemplification, take you la Madame O’Brien—que magnifica!She is one goddess—one Juno—what you call one ox-eyed Juno.”"
"凯利先生本来就很聪明，现在被他们自己想象的火焰燃烧得更加机灵了。","Now Mr. Kelley was a wit; and better men have been shriveled by the fire of their own imagination."
"“当然了！”他笑着说道，“但是你说的是一位用过氧化氢漂白出一头金发的朱诺，不是吗？”","“Sure!” he said with a grin; “but you mean a peroxide Juno, don’t you?”"
"奥布赖恩女士听到后，抬起一头金发看了看。她充满商业智慧的眼睛扫了一眼慢慢远去的凯利先生的背影。除了在街上坐车的时候，一个人是不该无缘无故地对一位女士无理的。","Mrs. O’Brien heard, and lifted an auriferous head.Her businesslike eye rested for an instant upon the disappearing form of Mr. Kelley.Except in street cars one should never be unnecessarily rude to a lady."
"这个多情的哥伦比亚人和他的护送人到达了百老汇指定的地方，他们在接待室等了半个小时，然后进入了一个设备齐全的办公室，那里有一个看起来很有气派、面部光滑的人在伏案写东西。法尔孔将军来到这个美国国防部长面前，他的老朋友凯利先生说明了他的来意。","When the gallant Colombian and his escort arrived at the Broadway address, they were held in an anteroom for half an hour, and then admitted into a well-equipped office where a distinguished looking man, with a smooth face, wrote at a desk.General Falcon was presented to the Secretary of War of the United States, and his mission made known by his old friend, Mr. Kelley."
"“啊——哥伦比亚！”国防部长在听他解释时意味深长地说道，“做那笔交易恐怕有点小麻烦。总统和我在关于此事的意见上产生了分歧。他更倾向于现在的政府，但是我——”这个部长给将军留下了一个神秘而有鼓励性的微笑，“你当然知道，法尔孔将军，在坦慕尼战争以后，议会通过了一项决议要求所有从该国出口的武器和弹药都必须通过国防部。现在，我很乐意尽我所能来为您办成这件事，这都是看在我的老朋友凯利的面子上。但这件事情必须绝对保密，就像我说的那样，总统对你们哥伦比亚革命党人的努力并不认可。我会让我的勤务兵带来现在闲置在仓库里的武器的清单。”","“Ah—Colombia!” said the Secretary, significantly, when he was made to understand; “I’m afraid there will be a little difficulty in that case.The President and I differ in our sympathies there.He prefers the established government, while I—” the secretary gave the General a mysterious but encouraging smile.“You, of course, know, General Falcon, that since the Tammany war, an act of Congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms and ammunition exported from this country to pass through the War Department.Now, if I can do anything for you I will be glad to do so to oblige my old friend, Mr. Kelley.But it must be in absolute secrecy, as the President, as I have said, does not regard favorably the efforts of your revolutionary party in Colombia.I will have my orderly bring a list of the available arms now in the warehouse.”"
"部长按了一下铃，一个帽子上印有字母A. D. T.的勤务兵立刻出现在了屋子里。","The Secretary struck a bell, and an orderly with the letters A. D. T. on his cap stepped promptly into the room."
"“给我小武器存货清单的B列表。”部长说道。","“Bring me Schedule B of the small arms inventory,” said the Secretary."
"这个勤务兵很快拿回来一张打印好的纸。部长仔细地看了一会儿。","The orderly quickly returned with a printed paper.The Secretary studied it closely."
"“找到了，”他说道，“在9号仓库，政府的库存，那里有2000支温切斯特枪，它们被摩洛哥苏丹定过了，但是却忘记了付钱。我们的规矩是一手交钱一手交货。我亲爱的凯利，你的朋友法尔孔将军如果想要这些武器的话，就按厂价算好了。如果我现在结束我们的谈话，我想你会原谅我的。我正在等日本大臣和查尔斯·墨菲，他们随时会来！”","“I find,” he said, “that in Warehouse 9, of Government stores, there is shipment of 2,000 stands of Winchester rifles that were ordered by the Sultan of Morocco, who forgot to send the cash with his order.Our rule is that legal-tender money must be paid down at the time of purchase.My dear Kelley, your friend, General Falcon, shall have this lot of arms, if he desires it, at the manufacturer’s price.And you will forgive me, I am sure, if I curtail our interview.I am expecting the Japanese Minister and Charles Murphy every moment!”"
"这场谈话的结果之一就是，那个将军深切地感谢他那受人尊敬的朋友——凯利先生。而另一方面，聪明的国防部长在接下来的两天里忙着疯狂地购买空的放枪支的箱子，并用砖来填满它们，然后把这些箱子储存在特地租来的仓库里。这边，当这个将军回到西班牙旅馆的时候，奥布赖恩女士走向他，拿掉他西服领子上的一根线头说道：","As one result of this interview, the General was deeply grateful to his esteemed friend, Mr. Kelley.As another, the nimble Secretary of War was extremely busy during the next two days buying empty rifle cases and filling them with bricks, which were then stored in a warehouse rented for that purpose.As still another, when the General returned to the Hotel Español, Mrs. O’Brien went up to him, plucked a thread from his lapel, and said: "
"“先生，我并不想‘插嘴’，但是那个长着猴子的脸、猫的眼睛、到处东张西望的混混找你干嘛？”","“Say, señor, I don’t want to ‘butt in,’ but what does that monkey-faced, cat-eyed, rubber-necked tin horn tough want with you?”"
"“啊呀呀呀！”这个将军解释道，“你可不该这样形容我的好朋友，凯利先生。”","“Sangre de mi vida!” exclaimed the General.“Impossible it is that you speak of my good friend, Señor Kelley.”"
"“到夏季花园里来，”奥布赖恩女士说，“我想和你谈谈。”","“Come into the summer garden,” said Mrs. O’Brien.“I want to have a talk with you.”"
"我们不妨假设过了一个小时。","Let us suppose that an hour has elapsed."
"“你的意思是，”这个将军说，“18000美元就可以买到这个房子内所有的设备，还有一年的租期，包括这个如此可爱的花园在内？它太像我在哥伦比亚的庭院了。”","“And you say,” said the General, “that for the sum of $18,000 can be purchased the furnishment of the house and the lease of one year with this garden so lovely—so resembling unto the patios of my cara Colombia?”"
"“就是那么便宜。”奥布赖恩女士叹了一口气说。","“And dirt cheap at that,” sighed the lady."
"“啊，上帝啊！”法尔孔将军喘着气说，“战争和政治对于我来说算什么？这个地方简直是天堂。我的国家还有其他勇敢的英雄继续作战。荣耀和杀戮对我来讲有意义吗？啊！什么意义也没有。在这里我找到了一个天使。让我们买下西班牙旅馆，你将是我的人，钱不应该浪费在枪支上。”","“Ah, Dios!” breathed General Falcon.“What to me is war and politics?This spot is one paradise.My country it have other brave heroes to continue the fighting.What to me should be glory and the shooting of mans?Ah! no.It is here I have found one angel.Let us buy the Hotel Español and you shall be mine, and the money shall not be waste on guns.”"
"奥布赖恩女士把金色秀发梳成了高卷式，她把头靠在了哥伦比亚爱国者的肩膀上。","Mrs. O’Brien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of the Colombian patriot."
"“哦，先生，”她叹气道，愉快地说，“你真了不起！”","“Oh, señor,” she sighed, happily, “ain’t you terrible!”"
"两天后就是约定好提武器给这个将军的日子了。那些看起来装着枪支的箱子在租来的仓库里堆放着，国防部长坐在上面，等着他的朋友凯利带那个受骗人过来。","Two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms to the General.The boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the rented warehouse, and the Secretary of War sat upon them, waiting for his friend Kelley to fetch the victim."
"凯利先生准时赶到西班牙旅馆。他发现将军在桌子后面算账。","Mr. Kelley hurried, at the hour, to the Hotel Español.He found the General behind the desk adding up accounts."
"“我决定了，”这个将军说，“不买枪支了。我今天买下了这个旅馆的内部设备，佩里科·齐梅内斯·比利亚布兰卡·法尔孔将军将要和奥布赖恩女士结婚了。”","“I have decide,” said the General, “to buy not guns.I have to-day buy the insides of this hotel, and there shall be marrying of the General Perrico Ximenes Villablanca Falcon with la Madame O’Brien.”"
"凯利先生几乎窒息了。","Mr. Kelley almost strangled."
"“你这个秃顶的老鞋油瓶子，”他骂道，“你是个大骗子——说的就是你！你竟然用属于你那个不知道在哪儿的鬼国家的钱买了一个寄居所。”","“Say, you old bald-headed bottle of shoe polish,” he spluttered, “you’re a swindler—that’s what you are!You’ve bought a boarding house with money belonging to your infernal country, wherever it is.”"
"“啊，”这个将军一边结算一栏账目一边说，“那就是你所谓的政治。战争和革命都不是好的。是的。总是追随战争不是最好的选择。不是的。这个旅馆很值得拥有，尤其是和这位天后在一起——那个长着大大的眼睛的美丽天后。啊！她的金色秀发是多么美啊！”","“Ah,” said the General, footing up a column, “that is what you call politics.War and revolution they are not nice.Yes.It is not best that one shall always follow @Minerva@.No.It is of quite desirable to keep hotels and be with that Juno—that ox-eyed Juno.Ah! What hair of the gold it is that she have!”"
"凯利先生再次气愤到窒息。","Mr. Kelley choked again."
"“天啊，凯利先生！”将军最后充满感情地说道，“你从来都没有吃过奥布赖恩女士做的腌制碎牛肉末吗？”","“Ah, Senor Kelley!” said the General, feelingly and finally, “is it that you have never eaten of the corned beef hash that Madame O’Brien she make?”"
