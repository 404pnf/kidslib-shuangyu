		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一部作品，无论多么卑微，要想成为艺术品，它的每一行都应具有成为艺术品的理由。艺术大概可以这样定义：通过揭示隐藏在每个现象下的多样或惟一的真实，给可视世界以最高公正的一种一心一意的尝试。艺术是一种企求，想从世界的形式、色彩、光亮和阴影中，从事物的种种现象和生活的种种现实中，发现各自主要、持久和根本的东西——一种具有启发作用和令人信服的品质——它们存在的实质。艺术家和思想家、科学家一样，探求真理，表达呼声。因受到世界不同方面的影响，思想家一头扎进概念，科学家则钻入事实——他们从那儿钻出后，立即呼吁：要充分利用我们人类最擅长的能力，以防止人生旅途中的风险。他们以权威的身份提到我们的常识、提到我们的智力、提到我们求安或求乱的愿望；经常提到我们的偏见、有时提到我们的恐惧、时常提到我们的自私——可总是提到我们的盲信。我们充满敬意地聆听他们讲话，因为他们关心的都是重大问题：培育我们的心智、关照我们的身体、实现我们的抱负、完善我们的方法、颂扬我们伟大的奋斗目标。</td>
		<td class="en">A work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line.And art itself may be defined as a single-minded attempt to render the highest kind of justice to the visible universe, by bringing to light the truth, manifold and one, underlying its every aspect.It is an attempt to find in its forms, in its colours, in its light, in its shadows, in the aspects of matter and in the facts of life what of each is fundamental, what is enduring and essential—their one illuminating and convincing quality—the very truth of their existence.The artist, then, like the thinker or the scientist, seeks the truth and makes his appeal.Impressed by the aspect of the world the thinker plunges into ideas, the scientist into facts—whence, presently, emerging they make their appeal to those qualities of our being that fit us best for the hazardous enterprise of living.They speak authoritatively to our common-sense, to our intelligence, to our desire of peace or to our desire of unrest; not seldom to our prejudices, sometimes to our fears, often to our egoism—but always to our credulity.And their words are heard with reverence, for their concern is with weighty matters: with the cultivation of our minds and the proper care of our bodies, with the attainment of our ambitions, with the perfection of the means and the glorification of our precious aims.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艺术家却并非如此。</td>
		<td class="en">It is otherwise with the artist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艺术家面对同样难以解释的现象时，会深入到自己内心深处，在这个充满紧张与冲突的孤独的世界里，如果他有才华和运气的话，他会找到他的呼吁方式。他呼吁的是我们潜在的能力：我们天性的那部分；由于人类危险的生存条件，这些能力不得不隐藏在坚韧、刚强的本性里面，未曾显现——仿佛被钢盔罩着的易受伤害的肉体一样。他的呼吁不那么响亮，但更深沉；不那么清楚，但更动人——而且更快被遗忘。然而它的的影响却是经久不衰。一代代人的智慧随之改变，必然会摒弃一些观点、质疑一些事实、推翻一些理论。但是，艺术家呼唤的是我们身上不依赖于智慧的东西；这种东西与生俱来，而非后天获取——因此更具永恒性。他提到我们感知欢喜和惊奇的能力，提到我们关于人生秘密的感受；提到我们对同情、美和痛苦的感受；提到对众生潜在的友爱之情——提到一种微妙而强大的信念，即人类心灵息息相通，这种信念把无数颗寂寞的心连在了一起；提到人们在梦想、欢乐、痛苦、志向、幻觉、愿望、恐惧方面的心灵相通，这种沟通把所有人——死去的、活着的和即将出生的——连在了一起。</td>
		<td class="en">Confronted by the same enigmatical spectacle the artist descends within himself, and in that lonely region of stress and strife, if he be deserving and fortunate, he finds the terms of his appeal.His appeal is made to our less obvious capacities: to that part of our nature which, because of the warlike conditions of existence, is necessarily kept out of sight within the more resisting and hard qualities—like the vulnerable body within a steel armour.His appeal is less loud, more profound, less distinct, more stirring—and sooner forgotten.Yet its effect endures forever.The changing wisdom of successive generations discards ideas, questions facts, demolishes theories.But the artist appeals to that part of our being which is not dependent on wisdom; to that in us which is a gift and not an acquisition—and, therefore, more permanently enduring.He speaks to our capacity for delight and wonder, to the sense of mystery surrounding our lives; to our sense of pity, and beauty, and pain; to the latent feeling of fellowship with all creation—and to the subtle but invincible conviction of solidarity that knits together the loneliness of innumerable hearts, to the solidarity in dreams, in joy, in sorrow, in aspirations, in illusions, in hope, in fear, which binds men to each other, which binds together all humanity—the dead to the living and the living to the unborn.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >只有类似这样一串思想，或者干脆说是感受，才能一定程度上说明下面故事的创作目的：即为什么从众多迷惘、纯朴、默默无闻、备受漠视的人群中，选出这么几个人，描写他们卑微人生中不平静的插曲。因为，如果上面所谈的信念有一点道理的话，那么，很显然，世上没有哪个光明的地方或黑暗的角落不值得投以惊奇或同情的一瞥，哪怕是瞬间一瞥也好。因此，这个动机就可用来证明这部作品的创作价值；但这篇序言只公开谈谈所做的努力还不能止笔，因为谈得不够全面。小说——如果要想成为艺术——必须能够激发情感。事实上，小说像绘画、音乐，像所有艺术一样，是一种情感对其他无数种情感的呼唤，各种情感微妙而强大的力量赋予故事中的事件真实含义，创造出当时当地的道德与情感气氛。这种呼唤若要产生效力，必须通过各种感觉来表达；事实上，也无法通过其他途径，因为情感，无论是一个人的或是集体的，都不能通过说理得以表达。因此，所有艺术主要诉诸感觉；当艺术目的借助文字表达时，若其最高愿望是触及情感反应的秘密之源，那么，它必须诉诸各种感觉。它必须力求达到雕塑的造型、绘画的色彩、音乐的神奇启发性——这是最高的艺术。只有坚定不移地追求形式和内容的完美结合，只有毫不松懈，永不气馁地关注句子的结构和声音，才能接近造型、色彩之美，才能在平淡无奇的文字表面赋予千百年来被人们随意使用，磨得面目全非的古老词语的神奇联想之光。</td>
		<td class="en">It is only some such train of thought, or rather of feeling, that can in a measure explain the aim of the attempt, made in the tale which follows, to present an unrestful episode in the obscure lives of a few individuals out of all the disregarded multitude of the bewildered, the simple and the voiceless.For, if any part of truth dwells in the belief confessed above, it becomes evident that there is not a place of splendour or a dark corner of the earth that does not deserve, if only a passing glance of wonder and pity.The motive then, may be held to justify the matter of the work; but this preface, which is simply an avowal of endeavour, cannot end here—for the avowal is not yet complete.Fiction—if it at all aspires to be art—appeals to temperament.And in truth it must be, like painting, like music, like all art, the appeal of one temperament to all the other innumerable temperaments whose subtle and resistless power endows passing events with their true meaning, and creates the moral, the emotional atmosphere of the place and time.Such an appeal to be effective must be an impression conveyed through the senses; and, in fact, it cannot be made in any other way, because temperament, whether individual or collective, is not amenable to persuasion.All art, therefore, appeals primarily to the senses, and the artistic aim when expressing itself in written words must also make its appeal through the senses, if its highest desire is to reach the secret spring of responsive emotions.It must strenuously aspire to the plasticity of sculpture, to the colour of painting, and to the magic suggestiveness of music—which is the art of arts.And it is only through complete, unswerving devotion to the perfect blending of form and substance; it is only through an unremitting never-discouraged care for the shape and ring of sentences that an approach can be made to plasticity, to colour, and that the light of magic suggestiveness may be brought to play for an evanescent instant over the commonplace surface of words: of the old, old words, worn thin, defaced by ages of careless usage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >真诚努力地完成这项具有创新性的任务，不遗余力地沿着这条路走下去，不怕跌倒、困顿和指责是散文工作者应尽的职责。只要无愧于心，对于那些满心追求功名利禄，而又明确要求得到启迪、慰藉和快乐的人，还有那些要求立刻受到启智、鼓励，感到恐惧、震惊或陶醉的人，他的回答必然是：我努力完成的任务是用文字的力量让你去倾听、去感受——最重要的是，让你“看到”。别无其他，仅此而已。要是我成功了，你就可以在我书中找到你需要的东西：鼓励、安慰、恐惧、陶醉——你需要的一切——还有，也许你忘记要求的：对事实的惊鸿一瞥。凭借一时之勇，从匆匆逝去的残酷时光里抢出一个生活片段，这仅是这项任务的开端。要审慎、忠实地对待这项任务，就要毫不犹豫，不加区分、勇敢无畏地把救出的片段以真诚的心态呈现在读者眼前。去展现它的震动、色彩、形式；通过它的运动和色彩来揭示事实的本质——揭示其鼓舞人心的秘密：每个令人信服的瞬间所蕴含的紧张和激情。在这样专心致志的尝试中，如果你既有天赋又幸运的话，你的作品也许就能达到真诚无暇的程度，最终你所呈现的悔恨、同情、恐惧或欢乐必然会唤起读者心中彼此相连的感受；在人类的神秘起源、辛勤劳作、欢乐、希望或无常命运上，这种感受是彼此相连的，它把人与人连系在了一起，把人类与斑斓的世界连系在了一起。显然，坚持上述信念的人，姑且不论正确与否，他都不会忠实于创作技巧的任何一种临时原则。这些原则中最持久的东西——真实，是任何一种原则都不能完全掩盖的——应当留下来作为他最珍贵的财富，而所有这些原则：现实主义、浪漫主义、自然主义，甚至未被文坛正式接受的伤感主义（像贫穷一样，伤感主义是极其难以消除的），所有这些神灵，经过短暂的相伴之后，必然都会舍他而去——即使他刚刚步入神殿门槛——让他去琢磨他的良知，让他去体会他工作的艰辛。在这种心神不安的孤独情形下，为艺术而艺术的最高呼声也逐渐失去了它那明显不道德的声音，这声音一度多么令人激动。这种声音越来越远。它不再是一种疾呼，听起来像是耳语，总是听不太懂，但偶尔也能起到微弱的鼓舞作用。</td>
		<td class="en">The sincere endeavour to accomplish that creative task, to go as far on that road as his strength will carry him, to go undeterred by faltering, weariness or reproach, is the only valid justification for the worker in prose.And if his conscience is clear, his answer to those who in the fulness of a wisdom which looks for immediate profit, demand specifically to be edified, consoled, amused; who demand to be promptly improved, or encouraged, or frightened, or shocked, or charmed, must run thus:—My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel—it is, before all, to make you—see—.That—and no more, and it is everything.If I succeed, you shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement, consolation, fear, charm—all you demand—and, perhaps, also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask. To snatch in a moment of courage, from the remorseless rush of time, a passing phase of life, is only the beginning of the task.The task approached in tenderness and faith is to hold up unquestioningly, without choice and without fear, the rescued fragment before all eyes in the light of a sincere mood.It is to show its vibration, its colour, its form; and through its movement, its form, and its colour, reveal the substance of its truth—disclose its inspiring secret: the stress and passion within the core of each convincing moment.In a single-minded attempt of that kind, if one be deserving and fortunate, one may perchance attain to such clearness of sincerity that at last the presented vision of regret or pity, of terror or mirth, shall awaken in the hearts of the beholders that feeling of unavoidable solidarity; of the solidarity in mysterious origin, in toil, in joy, in hope, in uncertain fate, which binds men to each other and all mankind to the visible world.It is evident that he who, rightly or wrongly, holds by the convictions expressed above cannot be faithful to any one of the temporary formulas of his craft.The enduring part of them—the truth which each only imperfectly veils—should abide with him as the most precious of his possessions, but they all: Realism, Romanticism, Naturalism, even the unofficial senti-mentalism (which like the poor, is exceedingly difficult to get rid of,) all these gods must, after a short period of fellowship, abandon him—even on the very threshold of the temple—to the stammerings of his conscience and to the outspoken consciousness of the difficulties of his work.In that uneasy solitude the supreme cry of Art for Art itself, loses the exciting ring of its apparent immorality.It sounds far off.It has ceased’ to be a cry, and is heard only as a whisper, often incomprehensible, but at times and faintly encouraging.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时，我们躺在路旁的树荫下，悠闲地舒展着身体，观看远处田间劳作者的举动，过上一会儿，我们就会百无聊赖地去想，这个人到底在忙什么。我们看他活动着身体，舞动着双臂，弯下腰，站起来，迟疑下一步干什么，然后重复这些动作。倘若明白了他劳动的目的，兴许会给我们的无聊时光增添一丝乐趣。倘若知道他在使劲搬石头，挖沟或刨树根，我们就会带着更实在的兴趣看他劳动，也会宽恕他劳作时发出的噪声打破了田园的宁静；如果我们怀着兄弟般的情意，我们还会原谅他的失败。因为我们明白他的目的，毕竟，这老兄尽力了，也许他力气有限——也许他知识不够。我们原谅了他，继续赶路——并且忘了这事。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes, stretched at ease in the shade of a roadside tree, we watch the motions of a labourer in a distant field, and after a time, begin to wonder languidly as to what the fellow may be at.We watch the movements of his body, the waving of his arms, we see him bend down, stand up, hesitate, begin again.It may add to the charm of an idle hour to be told the purpose of his exertions.If we know he is trying to lift a stone, to dig a ditch, to uproot a stump, we look with a more real interest at his efforts; we are disposed to condone the jar of his agitation upon the restfulness of the landscape; and even, if in a brotherly frame of mind, we may bring ourselves to forgive his failure.We understood his object, and, after all, the fellow has tried, and perhaps he had not the strength—and perhaps he had not the knowledge.We forgive, go on our way—and forget.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艺术工作者同样如此。艺术是漫长的，生命是短暂的，因而，成功遥遥无期。所以，当我们怀疑是否有力气走那么远的时候，我们不妨可以聊几句目的——艺术的目的，像生命一样，催人奋进，却异常艰难——层层迷雾遮掩住了它。艺术的目的不在获取成功结论的清晰逻辑里，也不在揭开称为自然法则的某个无情秘密中。艺术的目的同样伟大，却更难企及。</td>
		<td class="en">And so it is with the workman of art.Art is long and life is short, and success is very far off. And thus, doubtful of strength to travel so far, we talk a little about the aim—the aim of art, which, like life itself, is inspiring, difficult—obscured by mists—It is not in the clear logic of a triumphant conclusion; it is not in the unveiling of one of those heartless secrets which are called the Laws of Nature.It is not less great, but only more difficult.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >让那些忙于经纶事务的人们停下来，喘口气，逼那些沉醉于自己远大目标的人们瞥一眼周围的形、色、光、影；使他们止住脚步看一眼，叹一声，笑一下——这就是目标，难以企及，瞬间即逝，并且只有少数人才能完成。然而有时候，有才能的幸运儿即便是如此艰巨的任务也照样能够完成。任务一旦完成，看吧——所有生活的真实就会尽收眼底：一瞬风景，一声叹息，一个微笑——然后回归到永恒的平静。</td>
		<td class="en">To arrest, for the space of a breath, the hands busy about the work of the earth, and compel men entranced by the sight of distant goals to glance for a moment at the surrounding vision of form and colour, of sunshine and shadows; to make them pause for a look, for a sigh, for a smile—such is the aim, difficult and evanescent, and reserved only for a very few to achieve.But sometimes, by the deserving and the fortunate, even that task is accomplished.And when it is accomplished—behold!—all the truth of life is there: a moment of vision, a sigh, a smile—and the return to an eternal rest.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The main deck was dark aft, but halfway from forward, through the open doors of the forecastle, two streaks of brilliant light cut the shadow of the quiet night that lay upon the ship.A hum of voices was heard there, while port and starboard, in the illuminated doorways, silhouettes of moving men appeared for a moment, very black, without relief, like figures cut out of sheet tin. The ship was ready for sea. The carpenter had driven in the last wedge of the mainhatch battens, and, throwing down his maul, had wiped his face with great deliberation, just on the stroke of five.The decks had been swept, the windlass oiled and made ready to heave up the anchor; the big tow-rope lay in long bights along one side of the main deck, with one end carried up and hung over the bows, in readiness for the tug that would come paddling and hissing noisily, hot and smoky, in the limpid, cool quietness of the early morning.The captain was ashore, where he had been engaging some new hands to make up his full crew; and, the work of the day over, the ship’s officers had kept out of the way, glad of a little breathing-time.Soon after dark the few liberty-men and the new hands began to arrive in shore-boats rowed by white-clad Asiatics, who clamoured fiercely for payment before coming alongside the gangway-ladder.The feverish and shrill babble of Eastern language struggled against the masterful tones of tipsy seamen, who argued against brazen claims and dishonest hopes by profane shouts.The resplendent and bestarred peace of the East was torn into squalid tatters by howls of rage and shrieks of lament raised over sums ranging from five annas to half a rupee; and every soul afloat in Bombay Harbour became aware that the new hands were joining the—Narcissus—.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A little fellow, called Craik and nicknamed Belfast, abused the ship violently, romancing on principle, just to give the new hands something to think over.Archie, sitting aslant on his sea-chest, kept his knees out of the way, and pushed the needle steadily through a white patch in a pair of blue trousers.Men in black jackets and stand-up collars, mixed with men bare-footed, bare-armed, with coloured shirts open on hairy chests, pushed against one another in the middle of the forecastle.The group swayed, reeled, turning upon itself with the motion of a scrimmage, in a haze of tobacco smoke.All were speaking together, swearing at every second word.A Russian Finn, wearing a yellow shirt with pink stripes, stared upwards, dreamy-eyed, from under a mop of tumbled hair.Two young giants with smooth, baby faces—two Scandinavians—helped each other to spread their bedding, silent, and smiling placidly at the tempest of good-humoured and meaningless curses.Old Singleton, the oldest able seaman in the ship, set apart on the deck right under the lamps, stripped to the waist, tattooed like a cannibal chief all over his powerful chest and enormous biceps.Between the blue and red patterns his white skin gleamed like satin; his bare back was propped against the heel of the bowsprit, and he held a book at arm’s length before his big, sunburnt face.With his spectacles and a venerable white beard, he resembled a learned and savage patriarch, the incarnation of barbarian wisdom serene in the blasphemous turmoil of the world.He was intensely absorbed, and as he turned the pages an expression of grave surprise would pass over his rugged features.He was reading “Pelham.” The popularity of Bulwer Lytton in the forecastles of Southern-going ships is a wonderful and bizarre phenomenon.What ideas do his polished and so curiously insincere sentences awaken in the simple minds of the big children who people those dark and wandering places of the earth?What meaning can their rough, inexperienced souls find in the elegant verbiage of his pages?What excitement?—what forgetfulness?—what appeasement?Mystery! Is it the fascination of the incomprehensible?—is it the charm of the impossible?Or are those beings who exist beyond the pale of life stirred by his tales as by an enigmatical disclosure of a resplendent world that exists within the frontier of infamy and filth, within that border of dirt and hunger, of misery and dissipation, that comes down on all sides to the water’s edge of the incorruptible ocean, and is the only thing they know of life, the only thing they see of surrounding land—those life-long prisoners of the sea?Mystery!Singleton, who had sailed to the southward since the age of twelve, who in the last forty-five years had lived (as we had calculated from his papers) no more than forty months ashore—old Singleton, who boasted, with the mild composure of long years well spent, that generally from the day he was paid off from one ship till the day he shipped in another he seldom was in a condition to distinguish daylight—old Singleton sat unmoved in the clash of voices and cries, spelling through “Pelham” with slow labour, and lost in an absorption profound enough to resemble a trance.He breathed regularly.Every time he turned the book in his enormous and blackened hands the muscles of his big white arms rolled slightly under the smooth skin.Hidden by the white moustache, his lips, stained with tobacco-juice that trickled down the long beard, moved in inward whisper.His bleared eyes gazed fixedly from behind the glitter of black-rimmed glasses.Opposite to him, and on a level with his face, the ship’s cat sat on the barrel of the windlass in the pose of a crouching chimera, blinking its green eyes at its old friend.It seemed to meditate a leap on to the old man’s lap over the bent back of the ordinary seaman who sat at Singleton’s feet.Young Charley was lean and long-necked.The ridge of his backbone made a chain of small hills under the old shirt.His face of a street-boy—a face precocious, sagacious, and ironic, with deep downward folds on each side of the thin, wide mouth—hung low over his bony knees.He was learning to make a lanyard knot with a bit of an old rope.Small drops of perspiration stood out on his bulging forehead; he sniffed strongly from time to time, glancing out of the corners of his restless eyes at the old seaman, who took no notice of the puzzled youngster muttering at his work.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The noise increased.Little Belfast seemed, in the heavy heat of the forecastle, to boil with facetious fury.His eyes danced; in the crimson of his face, comical as a mask, the mouth yawned black, with strange grimaces.Facing him, a half-undressed man held his sides, and, throwing his head back, laughed with wet eyelashes.Others stared with amazed eyes.Men sitting doubled up in the upper bunks smoked short pipes, swinging bare brown feet above the heads of those who, sprawling below on sea-chests, listened, smiling stupidly or scornfully.Over the white rims of berths stuck out heads with blinking eyes; but the bodies were lost in the gloom of those places, that resembled narrow niches for coffins in a whitewashed and lighted mortuary.Voices buzzed louder.Archie, with compressed lips, drew himself in, seemed to shrink into a smaller space, and sewed steadily, industrious and dumb.Belfast shrieked like an inspired Dervish:—“...So I seez to him, boys, seez I, ‘Beggin’ yer pardon, sorr’, seez I to that second mate of that steamer—‘beggin’ your-r-r pardon, sorr, the Board of Trade must ’ave been drunk when they granted you your certificate!’ ‘What do you say, you———!’ seez he, comin’ at me like a mad bull...all in his white clothes; and I up with my tar-pot and capsizes it all over his blamed lovely face and his lovely jacket....‘Take that!’ seez I.‘I am a sailor, anyhow, you nosing, skipper-licking, useless, sooperfloos bridge-stanchion, you!That’s the kind of man I am!’ shouts I....You should have seed him skip, boys!Drowned, blind with tar, he was!So...”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Don’t ’ee believe him!He never upset no tar; I was there!” shouted somebody.The two Norwegians sat on a chest side by side, alike and placid, resembling a pair of love-birds on a perch, and with round eyes stared innocently; but the Russian Finn, in the racket of explosive shouts and rolling laughter, remained motionless, limp and dull, like a deaf man without a backbone.Near him Archie smiled at his needle.A broad-chested, slow-eyed newcomer spoke deliberately to Belfast during an exhausted lull in the noise:—“I wonder any of the mates here are alive yet with such a chap as you on board!I conclude they ain’t that bad now, if you had the taming of them, sonny.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他飞沫四溅，挥舞着双臂，突然龇牙咧嘴，从衣兜里掏出一片黑色烟叶，怪模怪样地狠狠咬了一块。另一个新船员——长着一双机灵的眼睛，一副瘦削蜡黄的面孔，一直坐在船舱中间柜子的阴影里，微微张着嘴巴倾听着——此刻他像鸭子一样呱呱地叫了起来：“喂，不管怎么说，这是返航回家。坏也罢，好也罢，反正我觉着像睡觉一样容易——只要能到家就行。我会维护自己的权利的！我会让他们见识见识！”所有人都把目光转向了他。只有那位普通海员和猫没有理会。他站在那里，双手叉腰，个头矮小，长着白色睫毛。看样子他似乎早已领略过人世间的所有屈辱和愤恨。他好像曾经被人拳打脚踢，扔到污泥中；他仿佛被人撕扯唾弃，遭到污言秽语谩骂过……然而，他仍能笑脸面对周围的人，仍然觉得自己是安全的。在破毡帽的重压下，他的耳朵耷拉着。黑大衣尾部已经磨破，布条在他后腿处荡来荡去。他解开仅存的两个扣子，谁都看得到他里面没穿衬衣。想不出谁还会穿如此破烂的衣服，他穿着就像是偷来的，这也是他应受的罪。他的脖子又细又长，眼皮红红的，稀疏的胡须挂在下巴上，肩膀瘦削耷拉着，仿佛鸟儿折断的翅膀。身子左侧满是泥巴，可见最近在泥沟里睡过。不久前，由于一时疏忽犯傻，他竟混进一艘美国船，要不是溜得快，他这无用的躯壳免不了一顿毒打。无奈只得在当地海滨流浪了两周，讨点酒喝，忍饥挨饿，睡垃圾堆，在太阳下四处瞎转：真是一位来自梦魇世界的惊人访客。突然周围一阵沉默，他站在那里傻笑，令人生厌。干净雪白的水手舱倒成了他的避难所；在这里他可以懒散度日；可以打滚、闲躺、混吃——并且诅咒吃的食物；他可以展示偷懒、行骗、乞讨的才能；他必定能找到欺骗和欺负的对象——并且因此而得到回报。他们都了解他。这个不祥的幸存者证明了撒谎和无耻是永远可行的，难道世间还有什么地方不知道这个人吗？一位沉默寡言的长臂老水手，长着钩形的手指，一直仰卧在铺上抽烟，这时转过脸来冷冷地打量着他，然后，从他头顶上对着门猛啐了一长条雪白的唾沫。谁都知道他！他这个人一不会掌舵，二不会结绳，黑夜里只会偷懒；在桅杆高处，他只会用双臂和双腿发疯似地紧抱桅杆，诅咒狂风、雪雨、黑暗；别人工作时，他则会咒骂大海。当全体船员被召唤时，他总是最后一个出去，最先一个回来。他多半事情不会干，会干的又不愿干。然而，他却是慈善家和追逐私利的旱鸭子的宠儿。好一个值得同情和赞赏的人啊，对自己的权利一清二楚，而对勇气、毅力、心照不宣的信念和把全体船员凝聚在一起的不言而喻的忠诚浑然不知。这个生长在贫民窟中，无人管束，过着放荡不羁生活的家伙，对海上严酷的劳作充满了鄙视与痛恨。</td>
		<td class="en">He foamed, whirling his arms, then suddenly grinned and, taking a tablet of black tobacco out of his pocket, bit a piece off with a funny show of ferocity.Another new hand—a man with shifty eyes and a yellow hatchet face, who had been listening open-mouthed in the shadow of the midship locker—observed in a squeaky voice:—“Well, it’s a ‘omeward trip, anyhow.Bad or good, I can do it on my ’ed—s‘long as I get ’ome.And I can look after my rights!I will show ’em!”All the heads turned towards him.Only the ordinary seaman and the cat took no notice.He stood with arms akimbo, a little fellow with white eyelashes.He looked as if he had known all the degradations and all the furies.He looked as if he had been cuffed, kicked, rolled in the mud; he looked as if he had been scratched, spat upon, pelted with unmentionable filth...and he smiled with a sense of security at the faces around.His ears were bending down under the weight of his battered felt hat. The torn tails of his black coat flapped in fringes about the calves of his legs.He unbuttoned the only two buttons that remained and every one saw that he had no shirt under it.It was his deserved misfortune that those rags which nobody could possibly be supposed to own looked on him as if they had been stolen.His neck was long and thin; his eyelids were red; rare hairs hung about his jaws; his shoulders were peaked and drooped like the broken wings of a bird; all his left side was caked with mud which showed that he had lately slept in a wet ditch.He had saved his inefficient carcass from violent destruction by running away from an American ship where, in a moment of forgetful folly, he had dared to engage himself; and he had knocked about for a fortnight ashore in the native quarter, cadging for drinks, starving, sleeping on rubbish-heaps, wandering in sunshine: a startling visitor from a world of nightmares.He stood repulsive and smiling in the sudden silence.This clean white forecastle was his refuge; the place where he could be lazy; where he could wallow, and lie and eat—and curse the food he ate; where he could display his talents for shirking work, for cheating, for cadging; where he could find surely some one to wheedle and some one to bully—and where he would be paid for doing all this.They all knew him.Is there a spot on earth where such a man is unknown, an ominous survival testifying to the eternal fitness of lies and impudence?A taciturn long-armed shellback, with hooked fingers, who had been lying on his back smoking, turned in his bed to examine him dispassionately, then, over his head, sent a long jet of clear saliva towards the door.They all knew him!He was the man that cannot steer, that cannot splice, that dodges the work on dark nights; that, aloft, holds on frantically with both arms and legs, and swears at the wind, the sleet, the darkness; the man who curses the sea while others work.The man who is the last out and the first in when all hands are called.The man who can’t do most things and won’t do the rest.The pet of philanthropists and self-seeking landlubbers.The sympathetic and deserving creature that knows all about his rights, but knows nothing of courage, of endurance, and of the unexpressed faith, of the unspoken loyalty that knits together a ship’s company.The independent offspring of the ignoble freedom of the slums full of disdain and hate for the austere servitude of the sea.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He knew how to conquer the naive instincts of that crowd.In a moment they gave him their compassion, jocularly, contemptuously, or surlily; and at first it took the shape of a blanket thrown at him as he stood there with the white skin of his limbs showing his human kinship through the black fantasy of his rags.Then a pair of old shoes fell at his muddy feet.With a cry:—“From under,” a rolled-up pair of canvas trousers, heavy with tar stains, struck him on the shoulder.The gust of their benevolence sent a wave of sentimental pity through their doubting hearts.They were touched by their own readiness to alleviate a shipmate’s misery.Voices cried:—“We will fit you out, old man.” Murmurs:“Never seed seech a hard case....  Poor beggar....I’ve got an old singlet....Will that be of any use to you?...Take it, matey....”Those friendly murmurs filled the forecastle.He pawed around with his naked foot, gathering the things in a heap and looked about for more.Unemotional Archie perfunctorily contributed to the pile an old cloth cap with the peak torn off. Old Singleton, lost in the serene regions of fiction, read on unheeding.Charley, pitiless with the wisdom of youth, squeaked:—“If you want brass buttons for your new unyforms I’ve got two for you.” The filthy object of universal charity shook his fist at the youngster.—“I’ll make you keep this ‘ere fo’c’sle clean, young feller,” he snarled viciously.“Never you fear.I will learn you to be civil to an able seaman, you ignerant ass.”He glared harmfully, but saw Singleton shut his book, and his little beady eyes began to roam from berth to berth.—“Take that bunk by the door there—it’s pretty fair,” suggested Belfast.So advised, he gathered the gifts at his feet, pressed them in a bundle against his breast, then looked cautiously at the Russian Finn, who stood on one side with an unconscious gaze, contemplating, perhaps, one of those weird visions that haunt the men of his race.—“Get out of my road, Dutchy,” said the victim of Yankee brutality.The Finn did not move—did not hear.“Get out, blast ye,” shouted the other, shoving him aside with his elbow.“Get out, you blanked deaf and dumb fool.Get out.” The man staggered, recovered himself, and gazed at the speaker in silence.—“Those damned furriners should be kept under,” opined the amiable Donkin to the forecastle.“If you don’t teach ‘em their place they put on you like anythink.” He flung all his worldly possessions into the empty bed-place, gauged with another shrewd look the risks of the proceeding, then leaped up to the Finn, who stood pensive and dull.—“I’ll teach you to swell around,” he yelled.“I’ll plug your eyes for you, you blooming square-head.” Most of the men were now in their bunks and the two had the forecastle clear to themselves.The development of the destitute Donkin aroused interest.He danced all in tatters before the amazed Finn, squaring from a distance at the heavy, unmoved face.One or two men cried encouragingly: “Go it, Whitechapel!” settling themselves luxuriously in their beds to survey the fight.Others shouted: “Shut yer row!...Go an’ put yer ’ed in a bag!...” The hubbub was recommencing.Suddenly many heavy blows struck with a handspike on the deck above boomed like discharges of small cannon through the forecastle.Then the boatswain’s voice rose outside the door with an authoritative note in its drawl:—“D’ye hear, below there?Lay aft!Lay aft to muster all hands!”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There was a moment of surprised stillness.Then the forecastle floor disappeared under men whose bare feet flopped on the planks as they sprang clear out of their berths.Caps were rooted for amongst tumbled blankets.Some, yawning, buttoned waistbands.Half-smoked pipes were knocked hurriedly against woodwork and stuffed under pillows.Voices growled:—“What’s up?...Is there no rest for us?”—Donkin yelped:“If that’s the way of this ship, we’ll ’ave to change all that....You leave me alone....I will soon....”None of the crowd noticed him.They were lurching in twos and threes through the doors, after the manner of merchant Jacks who cannot go out of a door fairly, like mere landsmen.The votary of change followed them.Singleton, struggling into his jacket, came last, tall and fatherly, bearing high his head of a weather-beaten sage on the body of an old athlete.Only Charley remained alone in the white glare of the empty place, sitting between the two rows of iron links that stretched into the narrow gloom forward.He pulled hard at the strands in a hurried endeavour to finish his knot.Suddenly he started up, flung the rope at the cat, and skipped after the black tom which went off leaping sedately over chain compressors, with its tail carried stiff and upright, like a small flag pole.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Outside the glare of the steaming forecastle the serene purity of the night enveloped the seamen with its soothing breath, with its tepid breath flowing under the stars that hung countless above the mastheads in a thin cloud of luminous dust.On the town side the blackness of the water was streaked with trails of light which undulated gently on slight ripples, similar to filaments that float rooted to the shore.Rows of other lights stood away in straight lines as if drawn up on parade between towering buildings; but on the other side of the harbour sombre hills arched high their black spines, on which, here and there, the point of a star resembled a spark fallen from the sky. Far off, Byculla way, the electric lamps at the dock gates shone on the end of lofty standards with a glow blinding and frigid like captive ghosts of some evil moons.Scattered all over the dark polish of the roadstead, the ships at anchor floated in perfect stillness under the feeble gleam of their riding-lights, looming up, opaque and bulky, like strange and monumental structures abandoned by men to an everlasting repose.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Before the cabin door Mr. Baker was mustering the crew.As they stumbled and lurched along past the mainmast, they could see aft his round, broad face with a white paper before it, and beside his shoulder the sleepy head, writh dropped eyelids, of the boy, who held, suspended at the end of his raised arm, the luminous globe of a lamp.Even before the shuffle of naked soles had ceased along the decks, the mate began to call over the names.He called distinctly in a serious tone befitting this roll-call to unquiet loneliness, to inglorious and obscure struggle, or to the more trying endurance of small privations and wearisome duties.As the chief mate read out a name, one of the men would answer: “Yes, sir!” or “Here!” and, detaching himself from the shadowy mob of heads visible above the blackness of starboard bulwarks, would step bare-footed into the circle of light, and in two noiseless strides pass into the shadows on the port side of the quarterdeck.They answered in divers tones: in thick mutters, in clear, ringing voices; and some, as if the whole thing had been an outrage on their feelings, used an injured intonation: for discipline is not ceremonious in merchant ships, where the sense of hierarchy is weak, and where all feel themselves equal before the unconcerned immensity of the sea and the exacting appeal of the work.Mr. Baker read on steadily:—“Hansen—Campbell—Smith—Wamibo.Now, then, Wamibo.Why don’t you answer?Always got to call your name twice.”The Finn emitted at last an uncouth grunt, and, stepping out, passed through the patch of light, weird and gaudy, with the face of a man marching through a dream.The mate went on faster:—“Craik—Singleton—Donkin....O Lord!” he involuntarily ejaculated as the incredibly dilapidated figure appeared in the light.It stopped; it uncovered pale gums and long, upper teeth in a malevolent grin.—“Is there any-think wrong with me, Mister Mate?” it asked, with a flavour of insolence in the forced simplicity of its tone.On both sides of the deck subdued titters were heard.—“That’ll do.Go over,” growled Mr. Baker, fixing the new hand with steady blue eyes.And Donkin vanished suddenly out of the light into the dark group of mustered men, to be slapped on the back and to hear flattering whispers:—“He ain’t afeard, he’ll give sport to ‘em, see if he don’t.... Reg’lar Punch and Judy show....Did ye see the mate start at him?...Well! Damme, if I ever!...” The last man had gone over, and there was a moment of silence while the mate peered at his list.—“Sixteen, seventeen,” he muttered.“I am one hand short, bo’sen,” he said aloud.The big west-countryman at his elbow, swarthy and bearded like a gigantic Spaniard, said in a rumbling bass:—“There’s no one left forward, sir.I had a look round.He ain’t aboard, but he may, turn up before daylight.”—“Ay.He may or he may not,” commented the mate, “can’t make out that last name.It’s all a smudge....That will do, men.Go below.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Suddenly the nigger’s eyes rolled wildly, became all whites.He put his hand to his side and coughed twice, a cough metallic, hollow, and tremendously loud; it resounded like two explosions in a vault; the dome of the sky rang to it, and the iron plates of the ship’s bulwarks seemed to vibrate in unison, then he marched off forward with the others.The officers lingering by the cabin door could hear him say: “Won’t some of you chaps lend a hand with my dunnage?I’ve got a chest and a bag.” The words, spoken sonorously, with an even intonation, were heard all over the ship, and the question was put in a manner that made refusal impossible.The short, quick shuffle of men carrying something heavy went away forward, but the tall figure of the nigger lingered by the main hatch in a knot of smaller shapes.Again he was heard asking: “Is your cook a coloured gentleman?” Then a disappointed and disapproving “Ah! h’m!” was his comment upon the information that the cook happened to be a mere white man.Yet, as they went all together towards the forecastle, he condescended to put his head through the galley door and boom out inside a magnificent “Good evening, doctor!” that made all the saucepans ring.In the dim light the cook dozed on the coal locker in front of the captain’s supper.He jumped up as if he had been cut with a whip, and dashed wildly on deck to see the backs of several men going away laughing.Afterwards, when talking about that voyage, he used to say:—“The poor fellow had scared me. I thought I had seen the devil.”The cook had been seven years in the ship with the same captain.He was a serious-minded man with a wife and three children, whose society he enjoyed on an average one month out of twelve.When on shore he took his family to church twice every Sunday.At sea he went to sleep every evening with his lamp turned up full, a pipe in his mouth, and an open Bible in his hand.Some one had always to go during the night to put out the light, take the book from his hand, and the pipe from between his teeth.“For”—Belfast used to say, irritated and complaining—“some night, you stupid cookie, you’ll swallow your ould clay, and we will have no cook.”—“Ah! sonny, I am ready for my Maker’s call...wish you all were,” the other would answer with a benign serenity that was altogether imbecile and touching.Belfast outside the galley door danced with vexation.“You holy fool!I don’t want you to die,” he howled, looking up with furious, quivering face and tender eyes.“What’s the hurry?You blessed wooden-headed ould heretic, the divvle will have you soon enough.Think of Us...of Us...of Us!” And he would go away, stamping, spitting aside, disgusted and worried; while the other, stepping out, saucepan in hand, hot, begrimed and placid, watched with a superior, cock-sure smile the back of his “queer little man” reeling in a rage.They were great friends.</td></tr>

The true peace of God begins at any spot a thousand miles from the nearest land; and when He sends there the messengers of His might it is not in terrible wrath against crime, presumption, and folly, but paternally, to chasten simple hearts—ignorant hearts that know nothing of life, and beat undisturbed by envy or greed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the evening the cleared decks had a reposeful aspect, resembling the autumn of the earth.The sun was sinking to rest, wrapped in a mantle of warm clouds.Forward, on the end of the spare spars, the boatswain and the carpenter sat together with crossed arms; two men friendly, powerful, and deep-chested.Beside them the short, dumpy sailmaker—who had been in the Navy—related, between the whiffs of his pipe, impossible stories about Admirals.Couples tramped backwards and forwards, keeping step and balance without effort, in a confined space.Pigs grunted in the big pigstye.Belfast, leaning thoughtfully on his elbow, above the bars, communed with them through the silence of his meditation.Fellows with shirts open wide on sunburnt breasts sat upon the mooring bits, and all up the steps of the forecastle ladders.By the foremast a few discussed in a circle the characteristics of a gentleman.One said:—“It’s money as does it.” Another maintained:—“No, it’s the way they speak.” Lame Knowles stumped up with an unwashed face (he had the distinction of being the dirty man of the forecastle), and showing a few yellow fangs in a shrewd smile, explained craftily that he “had seen some of their pants.” The backsides of them—he had observed—were thinner than paper from constant sitting down in offices, yet otherwise they looked first-rate and would last for years.It was all appearance.“It was,” he said, “bloomin’ easy to be a gentleman when you had a clean job for life.” They disputed endlessly, obstinate and childish; they repeated in shouts and with inflamed faces their amazing arguments; while the soft breeze, eddying down the enormous cavity of the foresail, distended above their bare heads, stirred the tumbled hair with a touch passing and light like an indulgent caress.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Suddenly the face of Donkin leaning high-shouldered over the after-rail became grave.Something like a weak rattle was heard through the forecastle door.It became a murmur; it ended in a sighing groan.The washerman plunged both his arms into the tub abruptly; the cook became more crestfallen than an exposed backslider; the boatswain moved his shoulders uneasily; the carpenter got up with a spring and walked away—while the sailmaker seemed mentally to give his story up, and began to puff at his pipe with sombre determination.In the blackness of the doorway a pair of eyes glimmered white, and big, and staring.Then James Wait’s head protruding, became visible, as if suspended between the two hands that grasped a doorpost on each side of the face.The tassel of his blue woollen nightcap, cocked forward, danced gaily over his left eyelid.He stepped out in a tottering stride.He looked powerful as ever, but showed a strange and affected unsteadiness in his gait; his face was perhaps a trifle thinner, and his eyes appeared rather startlingly prominent.He seemed to hasten the retreat of departing light by his very presence; the setting sun dipped sharply, as though fleeing before our nigger; a black mist emanated from him; a subtle and dismal influence; a something cold and gloomy that floated out and settled on all the faces like a mourning veil.The circle broke up.The joy of laughter died on stiffened lips.There was not a smile left among all the ship’s company.Not a word was spoken.Many turned their backs, trying to look unconcerned; others, with averted heads, sent half-reluctant glances out of the corners of their eyes.They resembled criminals conscious of misdeeds more than honest men distracted by doubt; only two or three stared frankly, but stupidly, with lips slightly open.All expected James Wait to say something, and, at the same time, had the air of knowing beforehand what he would say.He leaned his back against the doorpost, and with heavy eyes swept over them a glance domineering and pained, like a sick tyrant overawing a crowd of abject but untrustworthy slaves.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He stopped.The nigger waited awhile, then said, in a gloomy tone:—“You would....What? Go an’ fight another such one as yourself.Leave me alone.It won’t be for long.I’ll soon die....It’s coming right enough!”Men stood around very still and with exasperated eyes.It was just what they had expected, and hated to hear, that idea of a stalking death, thrust at them many times a day like a boast and like a menace by this obnoxious nigger.He seemed to take a pride in that death which, so far, had attended only upon the ease of his life; he was overbearing about it, as if no one else in the world had ever been intimate with such a companion; he paraded it unceasingly before us with an affectionate persistence that made its presence indubitable, and at the same time incredible.No man could be suspected of such monstrous friendship!Was he a reality—or was he a sham—this ever-expected visitor of Jimmy’s?We hesitated between pity and mistrust, while, on the slightest provocation, he shook before our eyes the bones of his bothersome and infamous skeleton.He was for ever trotting him out.He would talk of that coming death as though it had been already there, as if it had been walking the deck outside, as if it would presently come in to sleep in the only empty bunk; as if it had sat by his side at every meal.It interfered daily with our occupations, with our leisure, with our amusements.We had no songs and no music in the evening, because Jimmy (we all lovingly called him Jimmy, to conceal our hate of his accomplice) had managed, with that prospective decease of his, to disturb even Archie’s mental balance.Archie was the owner of the concertina; but after a couple of stinging lectures from Jimmy he refused to play any more.He said:—“Yon’s an uncanny joker.I dinna ken what’s wrang wi’ him, but there’s something verra wrang, verra wrang.It’s nae manner of use asking me.I won’t play.” Our singers became mute because Jimmy was a dying man.For the same reason no chap—as Knowles remarked—could “drive in a nail to hang his few poor rags upon,” without being made aware of the enormity he committed in disturbing Jimmy’s interminable last moments.At night, instead of the cheerful yell, “One bell!Turn out!Do you hear there?Hey! hey! hey!Show leg!” the watches were called man by man, in whispers, so as not to interfere with Jimmy’s, possibly, last slumber on earth.True, he was always awake, and managed, as we sneaked out on deck, to plant in our backs some cutting remark that, for the moment, made us feel as if we had been brutes, and afterwards made us suspect ourselves of being fools.We spoke in low tones within that fo’c’sle as though it had been a church.We ate our meals in silence and dread, for Jimmy was capricious with his food, and railed bitterly at the salt meat, at the biscuits, at the tea, as at articles unfit for human consumption—“let alone for a dying man!” He would say:—“Can’t you find a better slice of meat for a sick man who’s trying to get home to be cured—or buried?But there!If I had a chance, you fellows would do away with it.You would poison me.Look at what you have given me!” We served him in his bed with rage and humility, as though we had been the base courtiers of a hated prince; and he rewarded us by his unconciliating criticism.He had found the secret of keeping for ever on the run the fundamental imbecility of mankind; he had the secret of life, that confounded dying man, and he made himself master of every moment of our existence.We grew desperate, and remained submissive.Emotional little Belfast was for ever on the verge of assault or on the verge of tears.One evening he confided to Archie:—“For a ha’penny I would knock his ugly black head off—the skulking dodger!” And the straightforward Archie pretended to be shocked!Such was the infernal spell which that casual St. Kitt’s nigger had cast upon our guileless manhood!But the same night Belfast stole from the galley the officers’ Sunday fruit pie, to tempt the fastidious appetite of Jimmy.He endangered not only his long friendship with the cook but also—as it appeared—his eternal welfare.The cook was overwhelmed with grief; he did not know the culprit but he knew that wickedness flourished; he knew that Satan was abroad amongst those men, whom he looked upon as in some way under his spiritual care.Whenever he saw three or four of us standing together he would leave his stove, to run out and preach.We fled from him; and only Charley (who knew the thief) affronted the cook with a candid gaze which irritated the good man.“It’s you, I believe,” he groaned, sorrowful and with a patch of soot on his chin.“It’s you.You are a brand for the burning!No more of your socks in my galley.”Soon, unofficially, the information was spread about that, should there be another case of stealing, our marmalade (an extra allowance: half a pound per man) would be stopped.Mr. Baker ceased to heap jocular abuse upon his favourites, and grunted suspiciously at all.The captain’s cold eyes, high up on the poop, glittered mistrustful, as he surveyed us trooping in a small mob from halyards to braces for the usual evening pull at all the ropes.Such stealing in a merchant ship is difficult to check, and may be taken as a declaration by men of their dislike for their officers.It is a bad symptom.It may end in God knows what trouble.The—Narcissus— was still a peaceful ship, but mutual confidence was shaken.Donkin did not conceal his delight.We were dismayed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Then illogical Belfast reproached our nigger with great fury.James Wait, with his elbow on the pillow, choked, gasped out:—“Did I ask you to bone the dratted thing?Blow your blamed pie.It has made me worse—you little Irish lunatic, you!” Belfast, with scarlet face and trembling lips, made a dash at him.Every man in the forecastle rose with a shout.There was a moment of wild tumult.Some one shrieked piercingly:—“Easy, Belfast!Easy!...”We expected Belfast to strangle Wait without more ado.Dust flew.We heard through it the nigger’s cough, metallic and explosive like a gong.Next moment we saw Belfast hanging over him. He was saying plaintively:—“Don’t!Don’t, Jimmy!Don’t be like that.An angel couldn’t put up with ye—sick as ye are.” He looked round at us from Jimmy’s bedside, his comical mouth twitching, and through tearful eyes; then he tried to put straight the disarranged blankets.The unceasing whisper of the sea filled the forecastle.Was James Wait frightened, or touched, or repentant?He lay on his back with a hand to his side, and as motionless as if his expected visitor had come at last.Belfast fumbled about his feet, repeating with emotion:—“Yes.We know.Ye are bad, but....Just say what ye want done, and....We all know ye are bad—very bad....” No!Decidedly James Wait was not touched or repentant.Truth to say, he seemed rather startled.He sat up with incredible suddenness and ease.“Ah! You think I am bad, do you?” he said gloomily, in his clearest baritone voice (to hear him speak sometimes you would never think there was anything wrong with that man).“Do you?...Well, act according!Some of you haven’t sense enough to put a blanket shipshape over a sick man.There!Leave it alone!I can die anyhow!” Belfast turned away limply with a gesture of discouragement.In the silence of the forecastle, full of interested men, Donkin pronounced distinctly:—“Well, I’m blowed!” and sniggered.Wait looked at him. He looked at him in a quite friendly manner.Nobody could tell what would please our incomprehensible invalid: but for us the scorn of that snigger was hard to bear.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Donkin’s position in the forecastle was distinguished but unsafe.He stood on the bad eminence of a general dislike.He was left alone; and in his isolation he could do nothing but think of the gales of the Cape of Good Hope and envy us the possession of warm clothing and waterproofs.Our sea-boots, our oilskin coats, our well-filled sea-chests, were to him so many causes for bitter meditation: he had none of those things, and he felt instinctively that no man, when the need arose, would offer to share them with him.He was impudently cringing to us and systematically insolent to the officers.He anticipated the best results, for himself, from such a line of conduct—and was mistaken.Such natures forget that under extreme provocation men will be just—whether they want to be so or not. Donkin’s insolence to long-suffering Mr. Baker became at last intolerable to us, and we rejoiced when the mate, one dark night, tamed him for good.It was done neatly, with great decency and decorum, and with little noise.We had been called—just before midnight—to trim the yards, and Donkin—as usual—made insulting remarks.We stood sleepily in a row with the forebrace in our hands waiting for the next order, and heard in the darkness a scuffly trampling of feet, an exclamation of surprise, sounds of cuffs and slaps, suppressed, hissing whispers:—“Ah!Will you!”...“Don’t!...Don’t!”...“Then behave.”...“Oh! Oh!...” Afterwards there were soft thuds mixed with the rattle of iron things as if a man’s body had been tumbling helplessly amongst the main-pump rods.Before we could realise the situation, Mr. Baker’s voice was heard very near and a little impatient:—“Haul away, men!Lay back on that rope!” And we did lay back on the rope with great alacrity.As if nothing had happened, the chief mate went on trimming the yards with his usual and exasperating fastidiousness.We didn’t at the time see anything of Donkin, and did not care.Had the chief officer thrown him overboard, no man would have said as much as “Hallo! he’s gone!”But, in truth, no great harm was done—even if Donkin did lose one of his front teeth.We perceived this in the morning, and preserved a ceremonious silence: the etiquette of the forecastle commanded us to be blind and dumb in such a case, and we cherished the decencies of our life more than ordinary landsmen respect theirs.Charley, with unpardonable want of —savoir vivre—, yelled out:—“’Ave you been to your dentyst?...Hurt ye, didn’t it?” He got a box on the ear from one of his best friends.The boy was surprised, and remained plunged in grief for at least three hours.We were sorry for him, but youth requires even more discipline than age. Donkin grinned venomously.From that day he became pitiless; told Jimmy that he was a “black fraud”; hinted to us that we were an imbecile lot, daily taken in by a vulgar nigger.And Jimmy seemed to like the fellow!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Singleton lived untouched by human emotions.Taciturn and unsmiling, he breathed amongst us—in that alone resembling the rest of the crowd.We were trying to be decent chaps, and found it jolly difficult; we oscillated between the desire of virtue and the fear of ridicule; we wished to save ourselves from the pain of remorse, but did not want to be made the contemptible dupes of our sentiment.Jimmy’s hateful accomplice seemed to have blown with his impure breath undreamt of subtleties into our hearts.We were disturbed and cowardly.That we knew.Singleton seemed to know nothing, understand nothing.We had thought him till then as wise as he looked, but now we dared, at times, suspect him of being stupid—from old age. One day, however, at dinner, as we sat on our boxes round a tin dish that stood on the deck within the circle of our feet, Jimmy expressed his general disgust with men and things in words that were particularly disgusting.Singleton lifted his head.We became mute.The old man, addressing Jimmy, asked:—“Are you dying?” Thus interrogated, James Wait appeared horribly startled and confused.We all were startled.Mouths remained open; hearts thumped, eyes blinked; a dropped tin fork rattled in the dish; a man rose as if to go out, and stood still.In less than a minute Jimmy pulled himself together:—“Why?Can’t you see I am?” he answered shakily.Singleton lifted a piece of soaked biscuit (“his teeth”—he declared—“had no edge on them now”) to his lips.—“Well, get on with your dying,” he said with venerable mildness; “don’t raise a blamed fuss with us over that job.We can’t help you.” Jimmy fell back in his bunk, and for a long time lay very still wiping the perspiration off his chin.The dinner-tins were put away quickly.On deck we discussed the incident in whispers.Some showed a chuckling exultation.Many looked grave.Wamibo, after long periods of staring dreaminess, attempted abortive smiles; and one of the young Scandinavians, much tormented by doubt, ventured in the second dog-watch to approach Singleton (the old man did not encourage us much to speak to him) and ask sheepishly:—“You think he will die?” Singleton looked up.—“Why, of course he will die,” he said deliberately.This seemed decisive.It was promptly imparted to every one by him who had consulted the oracle.Shy and eager, he would step up and with averted gaze recite his formula:—“Old Singleton says he will die.” It was a relief!At last we knew that our compassion would not be misplaced, and we could again smile without misgivings—but we reckoned without Donkin.Donkin “didn’t want to ’ave no truck with ’em dirty furriners.” When Nilsen came to him with the news: “Singleton says he will die,” he answered him by a spiteful “And so will you—you fat-headed Dutchman.Wish you Dutchmen were all dead—’stead comin’ takin’ our money inter your starvin’ country.” We were appalled.We perceived that after all Singleton’s answer meant nothing.We began to hate him for making fun of us.All our certitudes were going; we were on doubtful terms with our officers; the cook had given us up for lost; we had overheard the boatswain’s opinion that “we were a crowd of softies.” We suspected Jimmy, one another, and even our very selves.We did not know what to do. At every insignificant turn of our humble life we met Jimmy overbearing and blocking the way, arm-in-arm with his awful and veiled familiar.It was a weird servitude.</td></tr>

Only Mr. Baker’s delicate tact prevented an all-fired row: he refused to take us seriously.He came bustling forward, and called us many unpolite names but in such a hearty and seamanlike manner that we began to feel ashamed of ourselves.In truth, we thought him much too good a sailor to annoy him willingly: and after all Jimmy might have been a fraud—probably was!The forecastle got a clean up that morning; but in the afternoon a sick-bay was fitted up in the deck-house.It was a nice little cabin opening on deck, and with two berths.Jimmy’s belongings were transported there, and then—notwithstanding his protests—Jimmy himself.He said he couldn’t walk.Four men carried him on a blanket.He complained that he would have to die there alone, like a dog.We grieved for him, and were delighted to have him removed from the forecastle.We attended him as before.The galley was next door, and the cook looked in many times a day. Wait became a little more cheerful.Knowles affirmed having heard him laugh to himself in peals one day. Others had seen him walking about on deck at night.His little place, with the door ajar on a long hook, was always full of tobacco smoke.We spoke through the crack cheerfully, sometimes abusively, as we passed by, intent on our work.He fascinated us.He would never let doubt die.He overshadowed the ship.Invulnerable in his promise of speedy corruption he trampled on our self-respect, he demonstrated to us daily our want of moral courage; he tainted our lives.Had we been a miserable gang of wretched immortals, unhallowed alike by hope and fear, he could not have lorded it over us with a more pitiless assertion of his sublime privilege.</td></tr>

The men turned in wet and turned out stiff to face the redeeming and ruthless exactions of their glorious and obscure fate.Far aft, and peering watchfully to windward, the officers could be seen through the mist of squalls.They stood by the weather-rail, holding on grimly, straight and glistening in their long coats; and in the disordered plunges of the hard-driven ship, they appeared high up, attentive, tossing violently above the grey line of a clouded horizon in motionless attitudes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们注视着天气和轮船，就像岸上的人们注视着命运的重大转机。阿里斯顿船长一刻也没有离开过甲板，好像他就是船的一部分。乘务员哆哆嗦嗦，可还是光穿一件衬衣，顶着寒风，不时把热咖啡给他端来，还没等送到唇前，杯中的一半已被大风吹洒。他郑重其事地把剩下的咖啡一口气喝完。这时，密集的水花哗哗地溅落在他的雨衣上，海水嗖嗖地击打着他的高筒皮靴；他的眼睛一刻也没有离开过这艘船。他的眼睛直勾勾地望着她，好比一个痴情男人望着一位无私劳作的淑女，她纤细的生命之线维系了世界的全部意义和欢乐。我们都守望着她。她美丽，也有不足。可我们并不因此减少一丝对她的爱。我们高声赞美她的品质，相互夸耀这些品质，好像这些品质就是我们自己的，我们深知她惟一的缺陷，但避而不谈，将其隐藏在我们对她的深深爱慕之中。她出生在克莱德河畔，在灰蒙蒙的天空下，黑烟缭绕，锤子打铁的声音宛如雷声轰鸣。这条喧嚣阴沉的河上产生过各种各样美好的东西，它们漂流到普天同照的阳光下，深受人们喜爱。“水仙号”便是那完美巢中的一个。也许她没有其他许多东西完美，但她是我们的，因此，无与伦比。我们为她自豪。在孟买，无知的新水手说她是“标致的灰船”。标致！多么鄙俗的赞扬！我们知道她是下过水的海船中最壮观的一条。像许多海船一样，她有时极为暴怒。这一点我们尽量忘记。她十分苛刻。装货、驾驶，她都需要照顾，谁都无法确切知道多少关照才足够。人类在这方面总是有缺陷的！而船知道，有时她会利用益于健康的恐惧训练去纠正狂妄人类的无知。我们曾听说过一些过去航海的凶险故事。厨师（专业上讲是海员，可事实上不是水手）——遇到不幸的事情时，比如平底锅在乱滚，他会紧张不安，一边擦地板，一边沮丧地嘟哝道：“你瞧！看她干的好事！不定哪一次航行，她会把我们都淹死的！你等着看她会不会。”乘务员在忧心忡忡的生活里忙里偷闲，在厨房里稍微喘一下气，这时听到厨子的议论，便用富有哲理的话语答道：“不过，看到的人是无法说的。我可不想见到。”我们觉着这些恐惧很是好笑。我们的心都向着这位老人，当时，他紧逼轮船，让她牢牢把握住自己，迎着风一点点前移；他要求轮船在卷起的帆篷之下侧身越过巨浪。在这恶劣的天气里，人们聚在船尾，时刻等候着负责甲板值勤的长官发出尖声命令：“值班人员各就各位！”此刻，他们正站在那儿欣赏她的勇猛呢。他们的眼睛在风中闪烁；他们黝黑的面庞淌着比人的泪水要咸要苦的水珠；他们的胡须湿透了，直直地挂着，不住地滴水，宛如纤细的海草。他们的样子十分怪异：脚蹬长筒靴，头戴头盔式的帽子，身穿明晃晃的雨衣，笨重地行走起来，身体僵硬而庞大，仿佛寓言中穿着奇装异服探险的人们。每当她轻松地越到碧浪顶端时，大家就会用胳膊肘捅捅彼此的肋骨，满脸生辉，低语道：“她这招真聪明。”大家不约而同地转过头，冷笑着，望着那受挫的波浪吼叫着滚到下风去，怪兽般地发着狂怒，泛起一片白沫。但如果她未能及时躲闪而遭到重击，就会战战兢兢地立着不动，于是，我们紧握绳索，抬头望去，只见那湿透的窄幅帆篷，绷得紧紧的，在空中拼命摇曳，我们心想：“这也难怪。可怜的东西！”</td>

		<td class="en">The thirty-second day out of Bombay began inauspiciously.In the morning a sea smashed one of the galley doors.We dashed in through lots of steam and found the cook very wet and indignant with the ship:—“She’s getting worse every day.She’s trying to drown me in front of my own stove!” He was very angry.We pacified him, and the carpenter, though washed away twice from there, managed to repair the door.Through that accident our dinner was not ready till late, but it didn’t matter in the end because Knowles, who went to fetch it, got knocked down by a sea and the dinner went over the side.Captain Allistoun, looking more hard and thin-lipped than ever, hung on to full topsails and foresail, and would not notice that the ship, asked to do too much, appeared to lose heart altogether for the first time since we knew her.She refused to rise, and bored her way sullenly through the seas.Twice running, as though she had been blind or weary of life, she put her nose deliberately into a big wave and swept the decks from end to end.As the boatswain observed with marked annoyance, while we were splashing about in a body to try and save a worthless wash-tub:—“Every blooming thing in the ship is going overboard this afternoon.” Venerable Singleton broke his habitual silence and said with a glance aloft:—“The old man’s in a temper with the weather, but it’s no good bein’ angry with the winds of heaven.” Jimmy had shut his door, of course.We knew he was dry and comfortable within his little cabin, and in our absurd way were pleased one moment, exasperated the next, by that certitude.Donkin skulked shamelessly, uneasy and miserable.He grumbled:—“I’m perishin’ with cold outside in bloomin’ wet rags, an’ that ’ere black sojer sits dry on a blamed chest full of bloomin’ clothes; blank his black soul!”We took no notice of him; we hardly gave a thought to Jimmy and his bosom friend.There was no leisure for idle probing of hearts.Sails blew adrift.Things broke loose.Cold and wet, we were washed about the deck while trying to repair damages.The ship tossed about, shaken furiously, like a toy in the hand of a lunatic.Just at sunset there was a rush to shorten sail before the menace of a sombre hail cloud.The hard gust of wind came brutal like the blow of a fist.The ship relieved of her canvas in time received it pluckily: she yielded reluctantly to the violent onset; then coming up with a stately and irresistible motion, brought her spars to windward in the teeth of the screeching squall.Out of the abysmal darkness of the black cloud overhead white hail streamed on her, rattled on the rigging, leaped in handfuls off the yards, rebounded on the deck—round and gleaming in the murky turmoil like a shower of pearls.It passed away.For a moment a livid sun shot horizontally the last rays of sinister light between the hills of steep, rolling waves.Then a wild night rushed in—stamped out in a great howl that dismal remnant of a stormy day.</td></tr>

In the bed-places men lay booted, resting on elbows and with open eyes.Hung-up suits of oilskin swung out and in, lively and disquieting like reckless ghosts of decapitated seamen dancing in a tempest.No one spoke and all listened.Outside the night moaned and sobbed to the accompaniment of a continuous loud tremor as of innumerable drums beating far off.Shrieks passed through the air. Tremendous dull blows made the ship tremble while she rolled under the weight of the seas toppling on her deck.At times she soared up swiftly as if to leave this earth for ever, then during interminable moments fell through a void with all the hearts on board of her standing still, till a frightful shock, expected and sudden, started them off again with a big thump.After every dislocating jerk of the ship, Wamibo, stretched full length, his face on the pillow, groaned slightly with the pain of his tormented universe.Now and then, for the fraction of an intolerable second, the ship, in the fiercer burst of a terrible uproar, remained on her side, vibrating and still, with a stillness more appalling than the wildest motion.Then upon all those prone bodies a stir would pass, a shiver of suspense.A man would protrude his anxious head and a pair of eyes glistened in the sway of light glaring wildly.Some moved their legs a little as if making ready to jump out.But several, motionless on their backs and with one hand gripping hard the edge of the bunk, smoked nervously with quick puffs, staring upwards; immobilised in a great craving for peace.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">About half-past seven the pitchy obscurity round us turned a ghastly grey, and we knew that the sun had risen.This unnatural and threatening daylight, in which we could see one another’s wild eyes and drawn faces, was only an added tax on our endurance.The horizon seemed to have come on all sides within arm’s length of the ship.Into that narrowed circle furious seas leaped in, struck, and leaped out.A rain of salt, heavy drops flew aslant like mist.The main-topsail had to be goose-winged, and with stolid resignation every one prepared to go aloft once more; but the officers yelled, pushed back, and at last we understood that no more men would be allowed to go on the yard than were absolutely necessary for the work.As at any moment the masts were likely to be jumped out or blown overboard, we concluded that the captain didn’t want to see all his crowd go over the side at once.That was reasonable.The watch then on duty, led by Mr. Creighton, began to struggle up the rigging.The wind flattened them against the ratlines; then, easing a little, would let them ascend a couple of steps; and again, with a sudden gust, pin all up the shrouds the whole crawling line in attitudes of crucifixion.The other watch plunged down on the main deck to haul up the sail.Men’s heads bobbed up as the water flung them irresistibly from side to side.Mr. Baker grunted encouragingly in our midst, spluttering and blowing amongst the tangled ropes like an energetic porpoise.Favoured by an ominous and untrustworthy lull, the work was done without any one being lost either off the deck or from the yard.For the moment the gale seemed to take off, and the ship, as if grateful for our efforts, plucked up heart and made better weather of it.</td></tr>

One or two, shouting, scrambled up the rigging; most, with a convulsive catch of the breath, held on where they stood.Singleton dug his knees under the wheel-box, and carefully eased the helm to the headlong pitch of the ship, but without taking his eyes off the coming wave.It towered close-to and high, like a wall of green glass topped with snow.The ship rose to it as though she had soared on wings, and for a moment rested poised upon the foaming crest as if she had been a great sea-bird.Before we could draw breath a heavy gust struck her, another roller took her unfairly under the weather bow, she gave a toppling lurch, and filled her decks.Captain Allistoun leaped up, and fell; Archie rolled over him, screaming:—“She will rise!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她再次向下风倾斜；下层的三孔滑轮深深地浸在水里；人们的脚向上扬起，挂在倾斜的尾楼上狂踢乱舞。他们清楚地看到船的一侧没入水中，齐声叫道：“船要沉了！”前面水手舱的几扇门轰然打开，只见下面的值班员一个个挥着手臂猛冲过来；接着手膝着地倒在甲板上，甲板比房顶还要陡，他们沿着高的一侧向船尾爬去。下风头汹涌的波涛追赶着他们；他们痛苦不堪，在绝望中挣扎，就像被洪水追赶的猛兽；一个个费力爬上船尾楼迎风处的梯子，身体半裸，怒目圆睁；一到上面，便一群一群地冲向下风处，个个紧闭双眼，直到肋骨紧紧贴住围栏的铁柱，才如释重负地收住脚步。然后，他们呻吟着，滚在一起。刚才，轮船上浮过程中涌上来的大量海水冲毁了水手舱背风处的舱门他们看到了自己的箱子、枕头、毛毯、衣服飘到了海上。他们挣扎着来到上风头时，个个惊慌失措。床上的草垫子浮在水面，毛毯舒展开来，上下起伏；箱子里灌满了水，变得异常沉重，就像断了桅杆的船，在沉没前严重倾斜；阿奇的大衣伸直两臂漂了过来，仿佛淹死的水手漂在水面，而头却没在水中。有人尽管用手指拼命抓住木板，可还是向下滑；还有人挤在角落里，翻转着大大的眼睛。他们不停着叫喊着：“桅杆！砍倒！砍倒！……”一阵阴风呼啸着低低地从船身掠过，轮船侧向一边，使得迎风桁端直指乌云；而高高的桅杆，几乎要倒向海面，显得无限的长。木匠松开手，滚到天窗边，接着爬向船舱入口处，那里存放着一把大斧，就是为了应付这类紧急事情的。就在这时，上桅帆帆脚索断了，重重的铁链一端在空中荡来荡去啪啪作响，撞击出来的红色火花透过飞溅的水雾飘落下来。帆篷再次摆动，它是那样的突然，似乎要通过我们的牙缝把我们的心撕裂，很快，它就被撕成了一缕缕狭窄的布条，在风中摇曳，上面打满了结，继而沿着帆桁安静了下来。阿里斯顿船长挣扎着试图站起来，他的脸贴近甲板；甲板上，人们在绳子的末端摇荡，就像悬崖上掏鸟巢的强盗。阿里斯顿的一只脚不知踩住了谁的胸部；只见他脸色发紫；嘴唇哆嗦。他也在大叫；弯着腰，大声叫道：“别！别！”贝克先生把一条腿翘在罗盘箱的架子上，大声嚷嚷道：“你是说别？别砍？”他发疯似地摇着头。“别！别！”　正在爬行的木匠从他的双腿间听到这话立即瘫倒，笔直地躺在天窗的一角。接着大家一齐叫道——“别！别！”　然后所有人一动不动。他们等待轮船的彻底倾覆，好把他们抛入大海；除了狂风和大海的可怕吼声，这些人没有发出一丝抱怨，他们不惜献出还可以多活许多年的生命去看“那些可恶的桅杆滚下大海！”他们认为这是他们的惟一机会；但是一个其貌不扬的小个子晃着他那长着灰发的头颅叫道“别”，却一眼也没有看其他任何人。他们没人言语，只顾喘气。他们紧抓船栏，把绳的一端缠在胳膊上；紧拉螺钉环，你挤我扛地爬向可以立脚的地方；他们用双臂撑着，用臂肘、下巴甚至牙齿钩住上风头的任何东西：有几位被风浪抽打后暂时动弹不得，当挣扎着向上爬时，只觉海浪陡然跃起，狠狠地抽打着他们的背部。辛格尔顿一直把着船舵。他的头发在风中飞舞；狂风仿佛找到了自己的终生仇敌，牢牢揪住对方的胡须，使劲晃动他那颗苍老的头颅。他却怎么也不肯松手，双膝使劲嵌在辐条状的舵轮把柄里，宛如挂在了树枝上，上下翻飞。死神好像没有准备停当，又开始四处察看。唐金一只脚被套在绳环里，头朝下挂在我们下方，他脸对着甲板大叫道：“砍呀！砍呀！”　两名水手小心翼翼地顺绳滑下去救他；其他人在上面拉绳子。大家把他拉了上来，推到一个相对安全的地方，按住他不让动。他对船长破口大骂，对他挥舞着拳头，满嘴都是不堪入耳的污言秽语，并用脏话怂恿我们去“砍呀！别理会那杀人的傻瓜！砍呀，你们谁去！”刚才救过他的一个人用手背给了他一个嘴巴；他的头撞在甲板上，突然变得十分安静，只见他脸色苍白，呼吸急促，破裂的嘴唇淌出几滴血。在背风的一侧，还有一个人直挺挺地躺着，好像是吓昏了；幸亏防波板挡住了他，才没有掉到海里。此人是乘务员。我们只好像吊货物一样把他吊起来，因为他吓瘫了。他觉得船要翻时从备餐间里冲了出来，却身不由己地滚了下去，手里还攥着一个瓷缸。瓷缸没破。我们费了很大劲才把瓷缸从他手中夺过来，他看到瓷缸在我们手中时十分纳闷。“这东西怎么会在你们手里？”他用颤抖的声音反复问道。他的衬衣已经被风扯成碎片；裂开的双袖就像翅膀一样摆动着。两名海员把他捆紧，然后将绳子对折，把他捆得活像一捆湿衣服。贝克先生沿着这排人爬了过来，问道：“大家都在这儿吗？”接着一个个打量了一遍。有人神情茫然地眨巴着眼睛，有人痉挛似地颤抖着；沃米博把头垂在胸前；他们蜷缩在角落里，面带痛苦，气喘吁吁，手被绳索磨破了，长期抓握东西累得筋疲力尽。他们的嘴唇抽搐着，倾斜的轮船每次起伏，他们都感到一阵恶心，把嘴张得大大的，仿佛要大声叫喊。厨子抱着一根木柱，不由自主地重复背诵一段祷文。在这可怕噪声的每一短暂间歇中，就可听到这位没戴帽子没穿拖鞋的厨子在祈求我们生命的主不要把他引入歧途。不久，他也沉默不语了。这群饥寒交迫的人，身心交瘁，正等待着死亡的突然降临，他们没有发出一点声音；他们默默无语，在忧郁的沉思中倾听着狂风的可怕诅咒。</td>
		<td class="en">She gave another lurch to leeward; the lower deadeyes dipped heavily; the men’s feet flew from under them, and they hung kicking above the slanting poop.They could see the ship putting her side in the water, and shouted all together:—“She’s going!”Forward the forecastle doors flew open, and the watch below were seen leaping out one after another, throwing their arms up; and, falling on hands and knees, scrambled aft on all fours along the high side of the deck, sloping more than the roof of a house.From leeward the seas rose, pursuing them; they looked wretched in a hopeless struggle, like vermin fleeing before a flood; they fought up the weather ladder of the poop one after another, half naked and staring wildly; and as soon as they got up they shot to leeward in clusters, with closed eyes, till they brought up heavily with their ribs against the iron stanchions of the rail; then, groaning, they rolled in a confused mass.The immense volume of water thrown forward by the last scend of the ship had burst the lee door of the forecastle.They could see their chests, pillows, blankets, clothing, come out floating upon the sea.While they struggled back to windward they looked in dismay.The straw beds swam high, the blankets, spread out, undulated; while the chests, waterlogged and with a heavy list, pitched heavily like dismasted hulks, before they sank; Archie’s big coat passed with outspread arms, resembling a drowned seaman floating with his head under water.Men were slipping down while trying to dig their fingers into the planks; others, jammed in corners, rolled enormous eyes.They all yelled unceasingly:—“The masts!Cut!Cut!...”A black squall howled low over the ship, that lay on her side with the weather yard-arms pointing to the clouds; while the tall masts, inclined nearly to the horizon, seemed to be of an immeasurable length.The carpenter let go his hold, rolled against the skylight, and began to crawl to the cabin entrance, where a big axe was kept ready for just such an emergency.At that moment the topsail sheet parted, the end of the heavy chain racketed aloft, and sparks of red fire streamed down through the flying sprays.The sail flapped once with a jerk that seemed to tear our hearts out through our teeth, and instantly changed into a bunch of fluttering narrow ribbons that tied themselves into knots and became quiet along the yard.Captain Allistoun struggled, managed to stand up with his face near the deck, upon which men swung on the ends of ropes, like nest robbers upon a cliff.One of his feet was on somebody’s chest; his face was purple; his lips moved.He yelled also; he yelled, bending down:—“No!No!” Mr. Baker, one leg over the binnacle-stand, roared out:—“Did you say no?Not cut?” He shook his head madly.“No! No!” Between his legs the crawling carpenter heard, collapsed at once, and lay full length in the angle of the skylight.Voices took up the shout—“No!No!” Then all became still.They waited for the ship to turn over altogether, and shake them out into the sea; and upon the terrific noise of wind and sea not a murmur of remonstrance came out from those men, who each would have given ever so many years of life to see “them damned sticks go overboard!” They all believed it their only chance; but a little hard-faced man shook his grey head and shouted “No!” without giving them as much as a glance.They were silent, and gasped.They gripped rails, they had wound ropes’-ends under their arms; they clutched ringbolts, they crawled in heaps where there was foothold; they held on with both arms, hooked themselves to anything to windward with elbows, with chins, almost with their teeth: and some, unable to crawl away from where they had been flung, felt the sea leap up, striking against their backs as they struggled upwards.Singleton had stuck to the wheel.His hair flew out in the wind; the gale seemed to take its life-long adversary by the beard and shake his old head.He wouldn’t let go, and, with his knees forced between the spokes, flew up and down like a man on a bough.As Death appeared unready, they began to look about.Don-kin, caught by one foot in a loop of some rope, hung, head down, below us, and yelled, with his face to the deck:—“Cut!Cut!” Two men lowered themselves cautiously to him; others hauled on the rope.They caught him up, shoved him into a safer place, held him.He shouted curses at the master, shook his fist at him with horrible blasphemies, called upon us in filthy words to “Cut!Don’t mind that murdering fool!Cut, some of you!” One of his rescuers struck him a back-handed blow over the mouth; his head banged on the deck, and he became suddenly very quiet, with a white face, breathing hard, and with a few drops of blood trickling from his cut lip. On the lee side another man could be seen stretched out as if stunned; only the washboard prevented him from going over the side.It was the steward.We had to sling him up like a bale, for he was paralysed with fright.He had rushed up out of the pantry when he felt the ship go over, and had rolled down helplessly, clutching a china mug. It was not broken.With difficulty we tore it away from him, and when he saw it in our hands he was amazed.“Where did you get that thing?” he kept on asking us in a trembling voice.His shirt was blown to shreds; the ripped sleeves flapped like wings.Two men made him fast, and, doubled over the rope that held him, he resembled a bundle of wet rags.Mr. Baker crawled along the line of men, asking:—“Are you all there?” and looking them over.Some blinked vacantly, others shook convulsively; Wamibo’s head hung over his breast; and in painful attitudes, cut by lashings, exhausted with clutching, screwed up in corners, they breathed heavily.Their lips twitched, and at every sickening heave of the overturned ship they opened them wide as if to shout.The cook, embracing a wooden stanchion, unconsciously repeated a prayer.In every short interval of the fiendish noises around he could be heard there, without cap or slippers, imploring in that storm the Master of our lives not to lead him into temptation.Soon he also became silent.In all that crowd of cold and hungry men, waiting wearily for a violent death, not a voice was heard; they were mute, and in sombre thoughtfulness listened to the horrible imprecations of the gale.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几个小时过去了。大风在他们头顶上一直呼啸不止，极度倾斜的轮船正好让他们避风。可是，寒冷的阵雨却不时洒落在他们那不安而宁静的避难所。在这种新的惩罚折磨下，有人会抖动一下双肩。牙齿不住打颤。天气逐渐放晴，明媚的阳光在船上方闪烁。每当汹涌的海浪猛烈发作之后，在飞散的水雾中，美丽而易逝的彩虹圆拱般地悬挂在漂浮着的轮船上方。狂风突然间完全停了，利索得像一把寒光闪闪的锋利尖刀。在两个长胡子的老水手中间，查利被谁的围巾牢牢绑在甲板的螺钉环上，他默默地哭着，由于惊恐、饥寒和煎熬，也挤出了几滴少有的眼泪。他身旁有个人在他肋骨上拍了一下，粗鲁地问道：“你的嘴巴咋啦？这么好的天气还不能堵上，年轻人。”他小心地回头看了看，然后脱下大衣扔给了小伙子。另一个人凑到跟前，低声说道：“这下子可把你打扮得像模像样哩，小子。”他们扬起胳膊，使劲地夹了他一下。查利收回双脚，垂下眼皮。水手们觉得自己“不会马上被淹死”，便想找个舒适的地方，于是传来了呻吟叹息之声。克赖顿先生的脚受了伤，他绷着嘴唇躺在我们中间。他手下的几个人张罗着让他躺得舒服点。他没有说话，也不看谁一眼，只是一次次抬起胳膊，便于大伙摆弄，他年轻刚毅的脸上，肌肉纹丝不动。他们担心地问道：“现在舒适些了吗，先生？”他简单地答道：“可以了。”他是个年轻严厉的长官，可他的许多下属却说，他们喜欢他是因为他“吆喝我们上下甲板干活时表现出来的绅士风度。”　而其他无法体会这种细腻情感的人，敬重他是因为他的帅气。自从轮船靠支撑在横梁一端行驶以来，阿里斯顿低头看下属一眼，这还是第一次。他几乎要站直了——一只脚靠着天窗一侧，一个膝盖抵着甲板；系在腰里的斜桁支索一端摇来摆去；他定睛向前方瞭望，似乎在寻找信号。他眼前这条船，在冷冷的阳光下闪烁着光芒，半边甲板没在水中，下面巨浪涌动，她也不住地上下起伏。我们开始觉得她有着惊人的浮力——按当时的情形讲。于是传来了自信的喊叫声：“伙计们，船好了！”贝尔法斯特满怀激情地嚷嚷道：“要是能让我抽上一袋烟，我宁可出上一个月的工资！”　有一两个人用干苦的舌头去舔咸涩的嘴唇，咕哝着“想要喝水”。厨子似乎得到了启示，爬了上去，用胸部抵住船尾楼上的水桶，向桶里看。桶底还有一些水。他挥舞着双臂大喊，于是有两个人拿着杯子分别向前向后爬。我们依次都喝了一大口。船长不耐烦地摇摇头，表示拒绝。当杯子递到查利跟前时，他旁边的人大声说道：“这傻孩子睡着了。”他睡得很沉，仿佛服了安眠药。他们没有叫醒他。辛格尔顿喝水时，用一只手把舵，他弯着腰好使嘴唇避开风。沃米博被推着叫着才看到水杯递到了自己眼前。诺尔斯风趣地说：“这杯水可比一杯好酒还珍贵。”贝克先生哼哼道：“谢谢。”　克赖顿先生喝罢点了点头。　唐金贪婪得一饮而尽，眼还死死盯着杯子的边沿。贝尔法斯特逗得我们捧腹大笑，他用嘴做着怪相大声叫道：“把杯子递到这边来。我们这儿都是禁酒守戒的人。”　有个人猫着腰再次把杯子递给船长并尖声说道：“船长，我们都喝过了。”船长摸着接过来，眼睛一直注视着前方，然后生硬地递回杯子，好像他的注意力半秒也不能离开这条船。大家的脸上都绽放出了光彩。我们对厨子大声招呼道：“干得好，大师傅！”他坐在背风处，身子撑在水桶上，不停地大声应和着，但就在此时，海浪又雷鸣般地发作起来，我们只能断断续续听到诸如“天意”和“再生”之类的字眼。他又玩起了他那讲经布道的老把戏。我们友好但又不无嘲讽地给他打手势，他在下面举起一只胳膊，牢牢地抓住另一只，双唇鼓动着；他满脸堆笑地望着我们，真诚地扯着嗓子喊，同时低头躲避水花。</td>
		<td class="en">Hours passed.They were sheltered by the heavy inclination of the ship from the wind that rushed in one long unbroken moan above their heads, but cold rain showers fell at times into the uneasy calm of their refuge.Under the torment of that new infliction a pair of shoulders would writhe a little.Teeth chattered.The sky was clearing, and bright sunshine gleamed over the ship.After every burst of battering seas, vivid and fleeting rainbows arched over the drifting hull in the flick of sprays.The gale was ending in a clear blow, which gleamed and cut like a knife.Between two bearded shellbacks Charley, fastened with somebody’s long muffler to a deck ring-bolt, wept quietly, with rare tears wrung out by bewilderment, cold, hunger, and general misery.One of his neighbours punched him in the ribs asking roughly:—“What’s the matter with your cheek?In fine weather there’s no holding you, youngster.” Turning about with prudence he worked himself out of his coat and threw it over the boy. The other man closed up, muttering:—“’Twill make a bloomin’ man of you, sonny.” They flung their arms over and pressed against him.Charley drew his feet up and his eyelids dropped.Sighs were heard, as men, perceiving that they were not to be “drowned in a hurry,” tried easier positions.Mr. Creighton, who had hurt his leg, lay amongst us with compressed lips.Some fellows belonging to his watch set about securing him better.Without a word or a glance he lifted his arms one after another to facilitate the operation, and not a muscle moved in his stern, young face.They asked him with solicitude:—“Easier now, sir?” He answered with a curt:—“That’ll do.” He was a hard young officer, but many of his watch used to say they liked him well enough because he had “such a gentlemanly way of damning us up and down the deck.” Others unable to discern such fine shades of refinement, respected him for his smartness.For the first time since the ship had gone on her beam ends Captain Allistoun gave a short glance down at his men.He was almost upright—one foot against the side of the skylight, one knee on the deck; and with the end of the vang round his waist swung back and forth with his gaze fixed ahead, watchful, like a man looking out for a sign.Before his eyes the ship, with half her deck below water, rose and fell on heavy seas that rushed from under her flashing in the cold sunshine.We began to think she was wonderfully buoyant—considering.Confident voices were heard shouting:—“She’ll do, boys!” Belfast exclaimed with fervour:—“I would giv’ a month’s pay for a draw at a pipe!” One or two, passing dry tongues on their salt lips, muttered something about a “drink of water.” The cook, as if inspired, scrambled up with his breast against the poop water-cask and looked in.There was a little at the bottom.He yelled, waving his arms, and two men began to crawl backwards and forwards with the mug.We had a good mouthful all round.The master shook his head impatiently, refusing.When it came to Charley one of his neighbours shouted:—“That bloom-in’ boy’s asleep.” He slept as though he had been dosed with narcotics.They let him be.Singleton held to the wheel with one hand while he drank, bending down to shelter his lips from the wind.Wamibo had to be poked and yelled at before he saw the mug held before his eyes.Knowles said sagaciously:—“It’s better’n a tot o’ rum.” Mr. Baker grunted:—“Thank ye.” Mr. Creighton drank and nodded.Donkin gulped greedily, glaring over the rim. Belfast made us laugh when with grimacing mouth he shouted:—“Pass it this way.We’re all taytottlers here.” The master, presented with the mug again by a crouching man, who screamed up at him:—“We all had a drink, captain,” groped for it without ceasing to look ahead, and handed it back stiffly as though he could not spare half a glance away from the ship.Faces brightened.We shouted to the cook:—“Well done, doctor!” He sat to leeward, propped by the water-cask and yelled back abundantly, but the seas were breaking in thunder just then, and we only caught snatches that sounded like: “Providence” and “born again.”He was at his old game of preaching.We made friendly but derisive gestures at him, and from below he lifted one arm, holding on with the other, moved his lips; he beamed up to us, straining his voice—earnest, and ducking his head before the sprays.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然有人叫道：“吉米在哪儿？”我们再次惊慌起来。在一排人的尽头，水手长声嘶力竭地问道：“有谁见他出来没有？”　许多人忧伤地惊叫道：“淹死了——会吗？不！在他的房间里……天啊……像只老鼠钻进了笼子……打不开门啊……唉！船倾得太快啦，水堵死了门……可怜的家伙！……谁也帮不了他……咱们去看看吧……”“该死的家伙，有谁愿意去？”唐金尖声叫道。“没人指望你去，”旁边的人怒气冲冲地说道，“你根本不算个人。”“有半点希望靠近他吗？”两三个人异口同声地问道。贝尔法斯特激情满腔，无所顾及，解开身上的绳子，嗖地一声冲到下风头，比闪电还快。我们惊慌万分，一起大声叫喊；他把双腿伸到船外，把稳身体，嚷嚷着要根绳子。到了生死关头，我们不觉得有什么可怕；所以，看到他脸色惊恐，乱踢乱蹬，反倒觉着可笑。不知是谁笑出了声，仿佛不由自主地受到欢快笑声的感染，这群桀骜不驯的家伙全都大笑起来，个个双目圆睁，就像捆在墙上的疯子。贝克先生从罗盘箱架旁转过来，把一条腿伸给他。他迅速爬了上来，带着几分恐惧，并对我们恶语相加，说我们是“恶魔”。“你呀……咳！真是个满嘴喷粪的东西，克雷克。”贝克先生哼哼唧唧地说。他结结巴巴，满怀忿恨地答道：“瞧他们吧，先生。一群肮脏的家伙!竟然取笑一个快要掉到海里的好友。他们也配称自己是人。”　这时水手长从船尾楼陡峭的边沿大声叫道：“过来。”贝尔法斯特连忙向他那边爬去。五个人把身体放稳后，注视着船尾楼的边沿，试图找出最好的前进路径。他们似乎有些犹豫。其他人缠绕在自己的绳套里，费劲地转过身，张大嘴巴注视着。阿里斯顿船长无暇注意这些；他似乎想凭借他那双具有超人注意力的眼睛保证轮船不沉。狂风在阳光里呼啸；柱柱浪花直冲云霄；彩虹突然出现在摇晃的轮船上方，彩光四射，救援人员小心翼翼地向前移动，一点一点，渐渐消失在人们的视线中。</td>
		<td class="en">Suddenly some one cried:—“Where’s Jimmy?” and we were appalled once more.On the end of the row the boatswain shouted hoarsely:—“Has any one seed him come out?” Voices exclaimed dismally:—“Drowned—is he?...No! In his cabin!...Good Lord!...Caught like a bloomin’ rat in a trap....Couldn’t open his door...Aye! She went over too quick and the water jammed it...Poor beggar!...No help for ’im....Let’s go and see...” “Damn him, who could go?” screamed Donkin.—“Nobody expects you to,” growled the man next to him: “you’re only a thing.”—“Is there half a chance to get at ’im?” inquired two or three men together.Belfast untied himself with blind impetuosity, and all at once shot down to leeward quicker than a flash of lightning.We shouted all together with dismay; but with his legs overboard he held and yelled for a rope.In our extremity nothing could be terrible; so we judged him funny kicking there, and with his scared face.Some one began to laugh, and, as if hysterically infected with screaming merriment, all those haggard men went off laughing, wild-eyed, like a lot of maniacs tied up on a wall.Mr. Baker swung off the binnacle-stand and tendered him one leg.He scrambled up rather scared, and consigning us with abominable words to the “divvle.” “You are....Ough! You’re a foul-mouthed beggar, Craik,” grunted Mr. Baker.He answered, stuttering with indignation:—“Look at ’em, sorr.The bloomin dirty images! laughing at a chum going overboard.Call themselves men, too.”But from the break of the poop the boatswain called out:—“Come along,”and Belfast crawled away in a hurry to join him.The five men, poised and gazing over the edge of the poop, looked for the best way to get forward.They seemed to hesitate.The others, twisting in their lashings, turning painfull, stared with open lips.Captain Allistoun saw nothing; he seemed with his eyes to hold the ship up in a superhuman concentration of effort.The wind screamed loud in sunshine; columns of spray rose straight up; and in the glitter of rainbows bursting over the trembling hull the men went over cautiously, disappearing from sight with deliberate movements.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波涛拍打着一半没入海水的甲板，他们摇摇晃晃地从波涛上的系索栓移到系缆墩。脚趾在木板上磨着。一排排碧绿刺骨的海水从船舷上泻下来，打在他们头顶上。他们暂时将身体挂在拉直的双臂上，喘着粗气，闭着眼睛——然后，松开一只手，歪着头保持平衡，设法抓住前面的绳索或柱子。那位长臂、健壮的水手长一下子窜了过去，用铁一般坚硬的拳头抓住东西，这时，忽然想起了“老婆子”最近来信中的话语。小个子贝尔法斯特怒气冲冲地攀爬着，嘴里嘟囔着“该死的黑鬼”。沃米博兴奋地伸着舌头，阿奇勇敢而镇定，机警冷静地观察着移动的时机。</td>
		<td class="en">They went swinging from belaying pin to cleat above the seas that beat the half-submerged deck.Their toes scraped the planks.Lumps of green cold water toppled over the bulwark and on their heads.They hung for a moment on strained arms, with the breath knocked out of them, and with closed eyes—then, letting go with one hand, balanced with lolling heads, trying to grab some rope or stanchion further forward.The long-armed and athletic boatswain swung quickly, gripping things with a fist hard as iron, and remembering suddenly snatches of the last letter from his “old woman.” Little Belfast scrambled in a rage spluttering “cursed nigger.” Wamibo’s tongue hung out with excitement; and Archie, intrepid and calm, watched his chance to move with intelligent coolness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了甲板室一侧的上方，他们依次松了手，重重地落了下去，四肢打开，手掌撑在光滑的柚木上。他们周围，回流的海浪激荡着白色浪花，哗哗作响。不用说，所有的门都成了活板门。第一个是厨房门。厨房从船的一侧延伸到另一侧，他们听到了海水空洞的冲击声。第二个是木匠工作间的门。他们把那扇门掀开往下看。房内似乎发生了地震。里面所有的东西都滚到了对着门的舱壁上，对面的舱壁上发现了吉米，不知是死是活。一条长凳、一个做到一半的食品柜、锯子、凿子、线材、斧头、撬棍堆在一起，上面还零零星星地散落着一些钉子。一把锋利的扁斧竖立着，明晃晃的斧刃发出瘆人的光，就像狰狞的笑容。大家彼此紧挨着，细心查看。轮船突然间诡秘的倾斜令人呕吐，几乎把大家全掀到海里去。贝尔法斯特一声吼叫“这边来！”随即跃身跳下。机警的阿奇紧随其后，抓住了一个木架子，木架随其漂流，他借助劈啪作响的断木喘息片刻。这里几乎没有容下三人移动的空间。在那阳光照射透着蓝天的方形门洞里，水手长长满胡须的黑脸和沃米博粗犷苍白的脸悬浮着——在密切观察。</td>
		<td class="en">When above the side of the house, they let go one after another, and falling heavily, sprawled, pressing their palms to the smooth teak wood.Round them the backwash of waves seethed white and hissing.All the doors had become trap-doors, of course.The first was the galley door.The galley extended from side to side, and they could hear the sea splashing with hollow noises in there.The next door was that of the carpenter’s shop.They lifted it, and looked down.The room seemed to have been devastated by an earthquake.Everything in it had tumbled on the bulkhead facing the door, and on the other side of that bulkhead there was Jimmy dead or alive.The bench, a half-finished meat-safe, saws, chisels, wire rods, axes, crowbars, lay in a heap besprinkled with loose nails.A sharp adze stuck up with a shining edge that gleamed dangerously down there like a wicked smile.The men clung to one another, peering.A sickening, sly lurch of the ship nearly sent them overboard in a body.Belfast howled “Here goes!” and leaped down.Archie followed cannily, catching at shelves that gave way with him, and eased himself in a great crash of ripped wood.There was hardly room for three men to move.And in the sunshiny blue square of the door, the boatswain’s face, bearded and dark, Wamibo’s face, wild and pale, hung over—watching.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们齐声叫喊：“吉米！吉米！”水手长在上面用低沉的声音叫道：“你。韦特！” 一阵沉默过后，贝尔法斯特乞求似地叫道：“吉米，吉米，亲爱的，你还活着吧？” 水手长说：“再叫一次！一齐喊，伙计们！” 于是大家一起使劲喊。沃米博的叫声像狗的狂吠。贝尔法斯特用一个铁块猛敲舱壁一侧。一切声响戛然而止。耳畔尖叫声和捶打声，微弱而清晰——仿佛合唱后的独唱。他还活着。他在我们下面急切地叫着敲着，好像过早地把活人装进了棺材。我们动手解救他。我们不顾一切，向那堆讨厌的东西发起进攻，有重的、尖的、难拿的。水手长爬到一边去找一根飘飞的绳头；沃米博被训斥声喝退：“别跳！别过来，糊涂蛋！”他依然呆在我们上面睁大眼睛观察。只见他两眼炯炯有神，牙齿熠熠发光，头发东倒西歪；活像一个疯疯癫癫的弱智野人，幸灾乐祸地旁观一个极其狼狈的落难者。水手长恳请大伙“搭把手”，于是，一条绳子放了下去。我们把各种杂物捆紧，只见它们晃晃悠悠被拉了上去，再也没被看见过。把东西扔到海里去的激动情绪支配了我们。我们拼命去救人，手被划破了，彼此粗鲁地招呼着。吉米不停的嚎叫声让人心烦；他像受刑的女人一样，扯着嗓子针刺一般尖叫，中间也不换气；他拳打脚踢，砰砰作响。他那极度的恐惧压榨着我们的心，我们感到非常痛苦，不想救他，想离开这井一般幽深、树一般摇摆的地方，逃到他听不见我们的去处，回到无比安静的船尾楼，在那儿我们宁愿被动等死。我们高喊着让他“看在上帝的份上，闭嘴”。 可他却叫得更凶了。他一定认为我们听不见。也许他自己听着也很微弱。我们想象着他蜷缩在上铺边沿，黑暗中气急败坏地用两个拳头捶着木板，张着大嘴不住地叫喊。这真是痛苦难耐的时刻。一片乌云掠过太阳，无情地将门口遮得暗淡许多。船的每次震动都会带来痛苦。我们四处攀爬，找不到喘息的地方，感到异常恶心。水手长对呆在下面的我们叫道：“搭把手！搭把手！你们要不快来帮忙，我们马上就会被冲走！”海浪一连三次越过高高的船侧，把满桶满桶的水直泼我们的头顶。吉米被这次冲击吓坏了，暂时停止了叫喊——也许是在等待船的沉没——接着又开始了他那凄惨的嚎叫，仿佛这阵恐惧给他增添了活力。地板上钉子洒了一地，有几英寸厚。真是可怕。世界上任何一颗没钉牢的钉子，仿佛都溜进了木匠的工作间。它们堆在那儿，各式各样，是七次航海积攒下来的。有镀锡平头铁钉，铜钉（像针一样尖）；抽水泵上用的钉，大头，就像小个铁蘑菇；无头钉（可怕）；法国钉，又亮又细。这些钉子厚厚地堆在一起，比刺猬还扎人。我们犹豫着想找一把铲子，这时，下面的吉米仿佛有人要剥他的皮似地大叫起来。我们呻吟着，把指头伸进钉子堆中，刺得生疼，摇摇手，钉子和血滴纷纷落下。我们把盛满各种钉子的帽子递给水手长，他好像在举行一个神秘的和平仪式，使劲将它们撒到愤怒的大海里。</td>
		<td class="en">Together they shouted: “Jimmy!Jim!” From above the boatswain contributed a deep growl: “You.Wait!” In a pause, Belfast entreated: “Jimmy, darlin’, are ye aloive?” The boatswain said: “Again!All together, boys!” All yelled excitedly.Wamibo made noises resembling loud barks.Belfast drummed on the side of the bulkhead with a piece of iron.All ceased suddenly.The sound of screaming and hammering went on thin and distinct—like a solo after a chorus.He was alive.He was screaming and knocking below us with the hurry of a man prematurely shut up in a coffin.We went to work.We attacked with desperation the abominable heap of things heavy, of things sharp, of things clumsy to handle.The boatswain crawled away to find somewhere a flying end of a rope; and Wamibo, held back by shouts:—“Don’t jump!...Don’t come in here, muddle-head!”—remained glaring above us—all shining eyes, gleaming fangs, tumbled hair; resembling an amazed and half-witted fiend gloating over the extraordinary agitation of the damned.The boatswain adjured us to “bear a hand,” and a rope descended.We made things fast to it and they went up spinning, never to be seen by man again.A rage to fling things overboard possessed us.We worked fiercely, cutting our hands and speaking brutally to one another.Jimmy kept up a distracting row; he screamed piercingly, without drawing breath, like a tortured woman; he banged with hands and feet.The agony of his fear wrung our hearts so terribly that we longed to abandon him, to get out of that place deep as a well and swaying like a tree, to get out of his hearing, back on the poop where we could wait passively for death in incomparable repose.We shouted to him to “shut up, for God’s sake.” He redoubled his cries.He must have fancied we could not hear him.Probably he heard his own clamour but faintly.We could picture him crouching on the edge of the upper berth, letting out with both fists at the wood, in the dark, and with his mouth wide open for that unceasing cry.Those were loathsome moments.A cloud driving across the sun would darken the doorway menacingly.Every movement of the ship was pain.We scrambled about with no room to breathe, and felt frightfully sick.The boatswain yelled down at us:—“Bear a hand!Bear a hand!We two will be washed away from here directly if you ain’t quick!” Three times a sea leaped over the high side and flung bucketfuls of water on our heads.Then Jimmy, startled by the shock, would stop his noise for a moment—waiting for the ship to sink, perhaps—and began again, distressingly loud, as if invigorated by the gust of fear.At the bottom the nails lay in a layer several inches thick.It was ghastly.Every nail in the world, not driven in firmly somewhere, seemed to have found its way into that carpenter’s shop.There they were, of all kinds, the remnants of stores from seven voyages.Tin-tacks, copper tacks (sharp as needles); pump nails with big heads, like tiny iron mushrooms; nails without any heads (horrible); French nails polished and slim.They lay in a solid mass more inabordable than a hedgehog.We hesitated, yearning for a shovel, while Jimmy below us yelled as though he had been flayed.Groaning, we dug our fingers in, and very much hurt, shook our hands, scattering nails and drops of blood.We passed up our hats full of assorted nails to the boatswain, who, as if performing a mysterious and appeasing rite, cast them wide upon a raging sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们终于接近了舱壁。舱壁是由结实的木板做的。她——“水仙号”这艘船——每个细节都做得十分精细。我们想，没有哪艘船的舱壁比她的更结实了。随后我们意识到，匆忙中我们把所有工具都扔进了大海。荒唐的小个子贝尔法斯特想用自己的体重推倒舱壁，像羚羊一样两脚腾空，嘴里骂着克莱德的造船工人干活太实在。他也捎带着骂起了整个英国北部、地球上其他地方、海洋——以及他所有的伙伴。当他重重地把脚跟放下来时，发誓说，他将永远永远不会同那些连“膝盖与臂肘都分不清”的傻瓜交往了。他咚咚地撞着，简直要把吉米最后一点魂也吓掉。我们能够听到那个惹人生气又令人同情的家伙在木板下窜来窜去。他已经喊破了嗓子，现在只能痛苦地发出吱吱呀呀的沙哑声。他的头或背这儿蹭一下，那儿蹭一下，让人难以捉摸。他躲避那无形的打击时，嘴里发出吱吱的声音。这种声音比嗷嗷直叫还凄惨。突然阿奇取出一根撬杠。这是他原来放在那儿的；还有一把小斧头。我们兴奋得欢呼起来。他猛劲砸下去，小木片在我们眼前乱飞。水手长在上面大叫：“当心！小心点。别把人砸死了。手脚轻点！”　沃米博欣喜若狂，低着头，拼命地给我们加油：“嘿！砸死他！嘿！嘿！”　我们担心他会滑到我们中间来误伤了谁，便连忙恳请水手长“把那该死的芬兰人推下船去”。然后大家一起对着下面的木板大声叫喊：“别站在下面！向前去。” 接着听听有没有动静。我们只听到头顶上低沉呜咽的风声，混杂着海浪的咆哮声和嘶嘶声。轮船仿佛被绝望压垮了，无精打采地摇荡着，我们的头随着她那不自然的起伏而摇摆。贝尔法斯特嚷嚷道：“为了上帝的爱，吉米，你到底在哪儿？……敲一敲！吉米亲爱的！……敲一敲！你这头残忍的黒兽！敲呀！”他悄无声息，就像墓中的死人；我们则像站在坟墓上的人，几乎要流出眼泪——可我们还感到烦恼、紧张、疲劳；想罢手不干，离开这里，找个地方躺下，在那里，我们能够看清危险，平静呼吸。阿奇叫道：“给我腾点地方！”我们蜷曲在他身后，护着头，他在木板接缝处一下接一下地砸着。舱壁咔嚓一下断开了。突然，撬杠从断开的长方形窟窿滑进了一半。就差半英寸没有捅到吉米的头。阿奇连忙抽回撬杠，而那无耻的黑鬼冲到窟窿前，凑上嘴唇，用几乎听不见的微弱声音说“救救我”；他把脑袋伸向窟窿，发疯似地想从一英寸宽三英寸长的小孔中钻出来。在如此混乱的情形下，我们简直被他那不可思议的举止吓呆了。把他赶走似乎不可能。即使阿奇，最终也失去了耐心。“你要是不滚开，我就用撬杠捅你的头。”他大声训斥道，语气十分坚决。他说到做到，他那认真的神态似乎对吉米产生了影响。他突然消失了，于是我们对板壁连撬带扯，那急切的样子就像对付不共戴天的仇敌，一心想把他撕得粉碎。木板裂开了，咔嚓一声坍倒了下来。贝尔法斯特把头和肩探下去，不怀好意地乱摸一通。“我摸到他啦！摸到啦。”他嚷嚷道。“哦！你瞧！……他溜了；我抓住了他！……使劲拉我的腿！……拉呀！”沃米博不住地狂叫。水手长发布指令：“抓住他的头发，贝尔法斯特；直接往上拉，你们两个一块儿！……使劲拉呀！” 我们使劲去拉。我们陡然把贝尔法斯特拽出来，非常不耐烦地将他丢在一边。他坐在那儿，脸色发紫，绝望地啜泣着说：“我咋才能抓住他那该死的短毛？”　突然，吉米的脑袋和肩膀露了出来。他卡在了中间，翻着眼睛，把唾沫吐在了我们脚边。我们急不可耐，疯狂地向他扑去，扯掉了他背上的衬衣，揪住了他的耳朵，对着他大口喘气；仿佛有人松开了他的双腿，一下子他跑到了我们手中。接下来，我们采用同样的动作，一鼓作气，把他推到上面。他发出刺耳的呼吸声，乱踢我们仰着的脸，紧紧抱住他头顶上的两双手臂，身体扭动着向上升起。由于上升急速，他那轻如气囊的身体，简直要从我们手中飞走。我们汗流浃背，攀爬着绳子，进到刺骨的冷风中，大家喘着气，仿佛跳进了冰水中。我们面部发烧，浑身哆嗦，冷气直透骨髓。我们觉得，以前狂风从来没有那么猛烈，大海从来没有那么疯狂，阳光从来没有那么无情和充满讥讽，轮船的处境从来没有那么绝望和可怕。她的每次震颤都是凶兆，预示着她那苦难航程的结束和我们灾难的来临。我们跌跌撞撞离开房门，船的突然摇摆让我们大吃一惊，纷纷摔倒在地，滚作一团。我们觉得船舱侧壁比玻璃还光，比冰还滑。除了一个偶尔用于闩门的长铜钩外，没有其他任何可以依附的东西。沃米博牢牢拉住铜钩，我们拉住沃米博，同时紧紧抓住吉米。他现在彻底瘫软了。似乎连握紧拳头的气力也没有了。我们忘记了恐惧，牢牢抓住吉米。谁也不担心沃米博会松手（我们知道这个野人比船上其他任何三人加起来力气都大），可我们担心铜钩会脱落，我们还深信不疑船已打定主意，最终要翻入大海。然而她并没有翻。一个大浪向我们袭来。水手长结结巴巴地说：“上来，走开。大海平静啦。大家快到船尾去，不然我们会在这儿完蛋的。”我们围着吉米站了起来。我们恳求他稳住不倒，至少要抓紧。他瞪着一双凸出的眼睛，鱼儿一样默不作声，所有的犟劲不复存在了。他不愿站稳；甚至不愿搂住我们的脖子；他简直就是一张黑皮，里面松松散散地装了些棉花和毛绒；他的胳膊和腿仿佛脱了臼，软软的，荡来荡去；他的头滚来滚去；下唇耷拉着，又大又重。我们紧紧护着他，心中充满烦恼与沮丧；我们一群人蹒蹒跚跚，为他遮挡风雨；在死亡的边缘，我们跌跌撞撞，做着神秘可笑的手势，尴尬的样子仿佛一群醉汉围着一具偷来的死尸。</td>
		<td class="en">We got to the bulkhead at last.Those were stout planks.She was a ship, well finished in every detail—the—Narcissus—was.They were the stoutest planks ever put into a ship’s bulkhead—we thought—and then we perceived that, in our hurry, we had sent all the tools overboard.Absurd little Belfast wanted to break it down with his own weight, and with both feet leaped straight up like a springbok, cursing the Clyde shipwrights for not scamping their work.Incidentally he reviled all North Britain, the rest of the earth, the sea—and all his companions.He swore, as he alighted heavily on his heels, that he would never, never any more associate with any fool that “hadn’t savee enough to know his knee from his elbow.” He managed by his thumping to scare the last remnant of wits out of Jimmy.We could hear the object of our exasperated solicitude darting to and fro under the planks.He had cracked his voice at last, and could only squeak miserably.His back or else his head rubbed the planks, now here, now there, in a puzzling manner.He squeaked as he dodged the invisible blows.It was more heartrending even than his yells.Suddenly Archie produced a crowbar.He had kept it back; also a small hatchet.We howled with satisfaction.He struck a mighty blow and small chips flew at our eyes.The boatswain above shouted:—“Look out!Look out there.Don’t kill the man.Easy does it!” Wamibo, maddened with excitement, hung head down and insanely urged us:—“Hoo!Strook’im! Hoo!Hoo!” We were afraid he would fall in and kill one of us and, hurriedly, we entreated the boatswain to “shove the blamed Finn overboard.” Then, all together, we yelled down at the planks:—“Stand from under!Get forward,” and listened.We only heard the deep hum and moan of the wind above us, the mingled roar and hiss of the seas.The ship, as if overcome with despair, wallowed lifelessly, and our heads swam with that unnatural motion.Belfast clamoured:—“For the love of God, Jimmy, where are ye?...Knock! Jimmy darlint!...Knock! You bloody black beast!Knock!” He was as quiet as a dead man inside a grave; and, like men standing above a grave, we were on the verge of tears—but with vexation, the strain, the fatigue; with the great longing to be done with it, to get away, and lie down to rest somewhere where we could see our danger and breathe.Archie shouted:—“Gi’e me room!” We crouched behind him, guarding our heads, and he struck time after time in the joint of planks.They cracked.Suddenly the crowbar went halfway in through a splintered oblong hole.It must have missed Jimmy’s head by less than an inch.Archie withdrew it quickly, and that infamous nigger rushed at the hole, put his lips to it, and whispered “Help” in an almost extinct voice; he pressed his head to it, trying madly to get out through that opening one inch wide and three inches long.In our disturbed state we were absolutely paralysed by his incredible action.It seemed impossible to drive him away.Even Archie at last lost his composure.“If ye don’t clear oot I’ll drive the crowbar thro’ your head,” he shouted in a determined voice.He meant what he said, and his earnestness seemed to make an impression on Jimmy.He disappeared suddenly, and we set to prising and tearing at the planks with the eagerness of men trying to get at a mortal enemy, and spurred by the desire to tear him limb from limb.The wood split, cracked, gave way.Belfast plunged in head and shoulders and groped viciously.“I’ve got ’im!Got ’im,” he shouted.“Oh! There!...He’s gone; I’ve got ’im!...Pull at my legs!...Pull!” Wamibo hooted unceasingly.The boatswain shouted directions:—“Catch hold of his hair, Belfast; pull straight up, you two!...Pull fair!” We pulled fair.We pulled Belfast out with a jerk, and dropped him with disgust.In a sitting posture, purple-faced, he sobbed despairingly:—“How can I hold on to ’is blooming short wool?” Suddenly Jimmy’s head and shoulders appeared.He stuck halfway, and with rolling eyes foamed at our feet.We flew at him with brutal impatience, we tore the shirt off his back, we tugged at his ears, we panted over him; and all at once he came away in our hands as though somebody had let go his legs.With the same movement, without a pause, we swung him up.His breath whistled, he kicked our upturned faces, he grasped two pairs of arms above his head, and he squirmed up with such precipitation that he seemed positively to escape from our hands like a bladder full of gas.Streaming with perspiration, we swarmed up the rope, and, coming into the blast of cold wind, gasped like men plunged into icy water.With burning faces we shivered to the very marrow of our bones.Never before had the gale seemed to us more furious, the sea more mad, the sunshine more merciless and mocking, and the position of the ship more hopeless and appalling.Every movement of her was ominous of the end of her agony and of the beginning of ours.We staggered away from the door, and, alarmed by a sudden roll, fell down in a bunch.It appeared to us that the side of the house was more smooth than glass and more slippery than ice. There was nothing to hang on to but a long brass hook used sometimes to keep back an open door.Wamibo held on to it and we held on to Wamibo, clutching our Jimmy.He had completely collapsed now.He did not seem to have the strength to close his hand.We stuck to him blindly in our fear.We were not afraid of Wamibo letting go (we remembered that the brute was stronger than any three men in the ship), but we were afraid of the hook giving way, and we also believed that the ship had made up her mind to turn over at last.But she didn’t.A sea swept over us.The boatswain spluttered:—“Up and away.There’s a lull.Away aft with you, or we will all go to the devil here.” We stood up surrounding Jimmy.We begged him to hold up, to hold on, at least.He glared with his bulging eyes, mute as a fish, and with all the stiffening knocked out of him.He wouldn’t stand; he wouldn’t even as much as clutch at our necks; he was only a cold black skin loosely stuffed with soft cotton wool; his arms and legs swung jointless and pliable; his head rolled about; the lower lip hung down, enormous and heavy.We pressed round him, bothered and dismayed; sheltering him we swung here and there in a body; and on the very brink of eternity we tottered all together with concealing and absurd gestures, like a lot of drunken men embarrassed with a stolen corpse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们必须得采取措施。一定把他弄到船尾。我们用绳子松松地系在他的两个胳肢窝下面，冒着生命危险，把他悬在前桅帆角索的铁角上。他一声不吭；看着既可笑又可怜，仿佛失去一半木屑的木偶；接着，我们穿过主甲板，开始了危险的旅程，小心翼翼地拖走这个可怜、瘦弱、令人憎恶的包袱。他不太重，但是即使他有一吨重的话，移动起来也不会比现在更困难。毫不夸张地说，我们是一人接一人地把他递过去的。每隔一会儿，我们就近把他系在系索栓上，喘口气，整理一下队形。要是系索栓断了，他就会无可挽回地掉进南部这片海洋，但他只得冒此风险；过了一会儿，他明白了怎么回事，便轻轻呻吟起来，费了很大劲，才哼出几句话。我们急切地侧耳细听。他抱怨我们太粗心，让他冒如此大的风险：“你看，我从那儿出来以后。”他有气无力地说着。“那儿”指的是他的小屋。并且是他自己出来的。显然我们什么也没帮他！……不要紧……我们继续对他施救，而他只能碰运气啦，因为我们别无选择；尽管当时我们比什么时候都恨他——恨他超过天底下任何事物——我们也不愿丢下他不管。迄今为止是我们救了他；而成功与否成了我们与大海之间的私事。我们的想法是对他永不放弃。如果我们（打一个不当的比喻）为救一个空桶而经历相似的艰辛和困难，那么，这只空桶对我们来说也会像吉米一样珍贵。事实上应该更为珍贵，因为我们没有理由痛恨水桶。可我们痛恨詹姆斯·韦特。我们无法摆脱心中的巨大怀疑：这个令人恐惧的黑人是在装病，面对我们的艰辛、我们的蔑视、我们的忍耐，他无动于衷，一直在装——现在不顾我们的忠诚——面对死亡，依然在装。他那不仗义的谎言令我们憎恶，同时，也唤醒了我们模糊不清、存有瑕疵的道德观念。可他却男子汉般地坚持他的劣行——真是令人吃惊。不！这不可能。他也完全处于极度痛苦之中。他感觉到那富有挑衅而又不可抗拒的死神时刻陪伴着他，结果造成了他这种坏脾气。不管谁与这专横的挚友相处都可能会发怒的。可是，我们又是什么样的人——满脑子都是这种念头！愤恨和猜疑在我们内心争斗，结果蹂躏了我们最美好的感情。因为怀疑我们憎恨他；因为不信任我们讨厌他。我们没有足够的理由鄙视他——同样，对他同情也有可能会损害自己的尊严。因此，我们尽管憎恨他，还是小心谨慎地把他从一个人的手中传到了另一个人的手中。我们大声喊道：“接好了吗？”“好啦。没问题。松手吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">Something had to be done.We had to get him aft.A rope was tied slack under his armpits, and, reaching up at the risk of our lives, we hung him on the fore-sheet cleet.He emitted no sound; he looked as ridiculously lamentable as a doll that had lost half its sawdust, and we started on our perilous journey over the main deck, dragging along with care that pitiful, that limp, that hateful burden.He was not very heavy, but had he weighed a ton he could not have been more awkward to handle.We literally passed him from hand to hand.Now and then we had to hang him up on a handy belaying-pin, to draw a breath and reform the line.Had the pin broken he would have irretrievably gone into the Southern Ocean, but he had to take his chance of that; and after a little while, becoming apparently aware of it, he groaned slightly, and with a great effort whispered a few words.We listened eagerly.He was reproaching us with our carelessness in letting him run such risks: “Now, after I got myself out from there,” he breathed out weakly.“There” was his cabin.And he got himself out.We had nothing to do with it apparently!...No matter....We went on and let him take his chances, simply because we could not help it; for though at that time we hated him more than ever—more than anything under heaven—we did not want to lose him.We had so far saved him; and it had become a personal matter between us and the sea.We meant to stick to him.Had we (by an incredible hypothesis) undergone similar toil and trouble for an empty cask, that cask would have become as precious to us as Jimmy was.More precious, in fact, because we would have had no reason to hate the cask.And we hated James Wait.We could not get rid of the monstrous suspicion that this astounding black-man was shamming sick, had been malingering heartlessly in the face of our toil, of our scorn, of our patience—and now was malingering in the face of our devotion—in the face of death.Our vague and imperfect morality rose with disgust at his unmanly lie.But he stuck to it manfully—amazingly.No! It couldn’t be.He was at all extremity.His cantankerous temper was only the result of the provoking invincible-ness of that death he felt by his side.Any man may be angry with such a masterful chum.But, then, what kind of men were we—with our thoughts!Indignation and doubt grappled within us in a scuffle that trampled upon the finest of our feelings.And we hated him because of the suspicion; we detested him because of the doubt.We could not scorn him safely—neither could we pity him without risk to our dignity.So we hated him and passed him carefully from hand to hand.We cried, “Got him?”—“Yes.All right.Let go.”</td></tr>

His eyes made two narrow white slits in the black face.The air escaped through his lips with a noise like the sound of bellows.We reached the poop ladder at last, and it being a comparatively safe place, we lay for a moment in an exhausted heap to rest a little.He began to mutter.We were always incurably anxious to hear what he had to say.This time he mumbled peevishly, “It took you some time to come!I began to think the whole smart lot of you had been washed overboard.What kept you back?Hey?

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们回到船尾楼，就像流浪者漂泊多年后回到了寂寞忧伤的故人之中。他们的眼睛在眼眶中慢慢地转动，瞥了我们一眼。这时传来了窃窃私语：“你们找到了他没有？”　这些熟悉的面孔看起来既陌生又亲切；显得更加憔悴、肮脏；个个脸上交织着疲惫与渴望的表情。在我们离开期间，他们似乎瘦了许多，仿佛处在被遗弃的境地，长期忍饥挨饿。船长手腕上缠着一圈绳子，单膝跪地，身体摇摆着，面容冰冷僵硬；可他的眼睛却活灵活现，密切关注着轮船动向，不曾理会任何人，好像沉浸在了超自然的努力中。我们把詹姆斯·韦特捆在一个安全的地方。贝克先生爬过来帮忙。克赖顿先生仰面躺着，脸色异常苍白，嘴里喃喃说道：“干得不错。”然后不屑地向我们、吉米和天空瞥了一眼，慢慢地闭上了眼睛。周围不断有人动弹动弹，但多数人无动于衷，在狭小的空间里，嘴里叽叽咕咕，浑身哆哆嗦嗦。夕阳西下。太阳是那样巨大，周围没有一丝乌云，红红的，低低的，仿佛在弯腰观察他们的脸。狂风呼啸着穿过太阳长长的光芒，那光芒明亮而寒冷，直直地照在凝视着的眼睛中放大的瞳孔上，可瞳孔一眨不眨。粘连在一起的缕缕头发和纠缠在一块的胡须，因夹杂了海水的盐分全变成了灰白色。人人面色如土，眼睛下面的黑斑一直延伸到耳际，笼罩了整个凹陷面颊的低洼处。嘴唇青灰消瘦，开合困难，仿佛与牙齿粘在了一起。有人在阳光下苦笑，打着寒战。也有人悲伤不已，一动不动。查利突然发觉自己因年轻而不被当回事，颇感忿恨，眼中射出可怕的光芒。两个没长胡须的挪威人就像虚弱的孩子，呆呆地注视着什么。下风侧水天相接处，黑浪翻滚，直冲灼烧的太阳。太阳缓慢下沉，圆圆的，亮亮的，浪尖冲击着明亮光环的边缘。其中一位挪威人似乎看到了这幅美景，十分惊喜，打开了话匣子。他的声音惊动了其他人，于是，大家都跟着动了起来。他们僵硬地晃晃脑袋，或者费劲地转过身望着他，感到吃惊，恐惧，或者仍然保持着深深的沉默。他对着落日念念有词，频频点头，此时，滚滚巨浪开始掠过深红色的圆盘；数英里辽阔汹涌的海面上，高浪的阴影随着奔腾的黑暗，扫过人们的面颊。一个顶似鸡冠的卷浪，发着嘶嘶的轰鸣声破碎了，太阳像被扑灭了一样，没了踪影。絮絮叨叨的谈话声时断时续，随后与白昼一同消失了。接着是一阵叹息声。海浪破碎声过后突然出现了片刻平静，有人少气无力地说：“那个讨厌的外国佬疯了。”　一个海员腰间系着绳子，用一只张开的手，反复快速地拍打着甲板。在越来越浓的暮霭中，只见一个大个子出现在船尾，他四肢着地，匍匐前行，那动作就像一只小心翼翼的大型野兽。那是贝克先生，他正从这排人身边经过。他对谁都哼唧两声表示鼓励，同时摸摸系在他们身上的绳索。有的眯着眼睛，就像受不了热时那样喘着气；有的用梦呓般的声音机械地答道：“啊！啊！先生！”　他爬过一个又一个，嘴里不停地咕哝道：“咳！……还得帮她渡过难关。”可是谁也没料到他会突然怒吼起来，责骂诺尔斯，因为他把应急舵具上的滑索截下了一长段。“咳！——真丢人——备用舵具——难道你不比谁清楚！——咳！——还是一等水手哩！咳！”那位跛脚水手无言以对。他咕哝道：“找点绳子给我系上吧，先生。” “咳！绳子——给你系上。你是勤杂工还是水手——什么？咳！——也许马上就用得上那舵啦——咳！——对于轮船来说，它比你这一瘸一拐的行尸走肉用处大。咳！——留着吧！——留着，既然你已经用了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The return on the poop was like the return of wanderers after many years amongst people marked by the desolation of time.Eyes were turned slowly in their sockets, glancing at us.Faint murmurs were heard, “Have you got ’im after all?” The well-known faces looked strange and familiar; they seemed faded and grimy; they had a mingled expression of fatigue and eagerness.They seemed to have become much thinner during our absence, as if all these men had been starving for a long time in their abandoned attitudes.The captain, with a round turn of a rope on his wrist, and kneeling on one knee, swung with a face cold and stiff; but with living eyes he was still holding the ship up, heeding no one, as if lost in the unearthly effort of that endeavour.We fastened up James Wait in a safe place.Mr. Baker scrambled along to lend a hand.Mr. Creighton, on his back, and very pale, muttered, “Well done,” and gave us, Jimmy and the sky, a scornful glance, then closed his eyes slowly.Here and there a man stirred a little, but most of them remained apathetic, in cramped positions, muttering between shivers.The sun was setting.A sun enormous, unclouded and red, declining low as if bending down to look into their faces.The wind whistled across long sunbeams that, resplendent and cold, struck full on the dilated pupils of staring eyes without making them wink.The wisps of hair and the tangled beards were grey with the salt of the sea.The faces were earthy, and the dark patches under the eyes extended to the ears, smudged into the hollows of sunken cheeks.The lips were livid and thin, and when they moved it was with difficulty, as though they had been glued to the teeth.Some grinned sadly in the sunlight, shaking with cold.Others were sad and still.Charley, subdued by the sudden disclosure of the insignificance of his youth, darted fearful glances.The two smooth-faced Norwegians resembled decrepit children, staring stupidly.To leeward, on the edge of the horizon, black seas leaped up towards the glowing sun.It sank slowly, round and blazing, and the crests of waves splashed on the edge of the luminous circle.One of the Norwegians appeared to catch sight of it, and, after giving a violent start, began to speak.His voice, startling the others, made them stir.They moved their heads stiffly, or turning with difficulty, looked at him with surprise, with fear, or in grave silence.He chattered at the setting sun, nodding his head, while the big seas began to roll across the crimson disc; and over miles of turbulent waters the shadows of high waves swept with a running darkness the faces of men.A crested roller broke with a loud hissing roar, and the sun, as if put out, disappeared.The chattering voice faltered, went out together with the light.There were sighs.In the sudden lull that follows the crash of a broken sea a man said wearily, “Here’s that blooming Dutchman gone off his chump.” A seaman, lashed by the middle, tapped the deck with his open hand with unceasing quick flaps.In the gathering greyness of twilight a bulky form was seen rising aft, and began marching on all fours with the movements of some big cautious beast.It was Mr. Baker passing along the line of men.He grunted encouragingly over every one, felt their fastenings.Some, with half-open eyes, puffed like men oppressed by heat; others mechanically and in dreamy voices answered him, “Aye!aye! sir!” He went from one to another grunting, “Ough!...See her through it yet;” and unexpectedly, with loud angry outbursts, blew up Knowles for cutting off a long piece from the fall of the relieving tackle.“Ough!———Ashamed of yourself———Relieving tackle———Don’t you know better!———Ough!———Able seaman!Ough!” The lame man was crushed.He muttered, “Get som’think for a lashing for myself, sir.”—“Ough!Lashing———yourself. Are you a tinker or a sailor———What?Ough!———May want that tackle directly———Ough!———More use to the ship than your lame carcass.Ough!———Keep it!———Keep it, now you’ve done it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他慢慢地爬着离开了，嘴里自言自语地说有些成年人“还不如孩子。”　这场争吵令人心情舒畅。可以听到有人发出低声的喝彩：“嗬……嗬。”那些一直在痛苦中打着盹的人们心惊肉跳地问道：“怎么啦？……什么事？”接下来的回答使人们感到意外的兴奋：“不知为了什么事，大副与跛脚杰克翻了脸。”“不会！”……“他能干什么坏事？”有人甚至咯咯地笑了起来。这犹如一丝希望，让人想起了过去平安的日子。吓呆了的唐金这时也突然恢复过来，开始大声嚷嚷：“听，这就是他们跟我们讲话的方式。你们为什么不揍他——你们谁都行？揍他。揍他呀！大副对我们指手画脚。我们和他一样也是人！我们现在都快下地狱了。我们在这破船上忍饥挨饿，为了他们这些黑心肠的恶棍，现在又要淹死了！揍他！”　在这渐深的夜幕下，他尖叫着，哭诉着，嚷嚷道：“揍他！揍他！”　夜越来越深，狂风不停地吼叫，生存权利被漠视给他带来的愤怒与恐惧时时刻刻折磨着他，这种折磨比黑夜中的阴影还可怕。船尾处只听贝克先生说道：“你们中没有谁能制止他——非让我去吗？”“闭嘴！”……“安静点！”几个人十分恼火地叫道，他们冻得瑟瑟发抖。“我马上赏你一记耳光，”一个暗处看不见的人用疲惫的声音说道，“我可不愿让大副费事。”他不再胡闹，失望地静静躺着。</td>
		<td class="en">He crawled away slowly, muttering to himself about some men being “worse than children.” It had been a comforting row. Low exclamations were heard: “Hallo...Hallo.”...Those who had been painfully dozing asked with convulsive starts, “What’s up?...What is it?”The answers came with unexpected cheerfulness: “The mate is going bald-headed for lame Jack about something or other.” “No!”....“What ’as he done?”Some one even chuckled.It was like a whiff of hope, like a reminder of safe days.Donkin, who had been stupefied with fear, revived suddenly and began to shout:—“’Ear ’im; that’s the way they tawlk to us. Vy donch ’ee ’it ’im—one ov yer?’It ’im.’It ’im!Comin’ the mate over us.We are as good men as ’ee!We’re all goin’ to ’ell now.We ’ave been starved in this rotten ship, an’ now we’re goin’ to be drowned for them black ’earted bullies!’It ’im!” He shrieked in the deepening gloom, he blubbered and sobbed, screaming:—“’It ’im!’It ’im!” The rage and fear of his disregarded right to live tried the steadfastness of hearts more than the menacing shadows of the night that advanced through the unceasing clamour of the gale.From aft Mr. Baker was heard:—“Is one of you men going to stop him—must I come along?” “Shut up!”...“Keep quiet!” cried various voices, exasperated, trembling with cold.—“You’ll get one across the mug from me directly,” said an invisible seaman, in a weary tone, “I won’t let the mate have the trouble.” He ceased and lay still with the silence of despair.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冰冷的南风在这深沉壮丽的天空下得意地狂吼。人们在难以抵挡的严寒威逼下瑟瑟发抖，仿佛要被撕成碎片。短促的呻吟刚到僵硬的嘴边就被吹跑了，没有谁能听见。有人低声抱怨“腰部以下完全麻木啦”，而闭目养神的人心里则想着胸口上还压着一块冰呢。有人用手无力地敲打着甲板——没完没了，筋疲力尽——可一点也不觉得手指疼痛，这不由令他们感到惊恐。沃米博目光恍惚，梦游一般。两个斯堪的纳维亚人牙齿打颤，不住地说着毫无意义的话语。几位消瘦的苏格兰人费了很大的劲才使下颚保持不动。几个西部老乡满脸怒气地躺在那儿，体积庞大，神情冷漠，有个人又是打呵欠又是诅咒。还有一位，呼吸时喉咙发出格格的响声。两位饱经风霜的老水手紧挨在一起，闲着无聊，低声谈论起他俩都认识的一家公寓的女老板。他们夸她具有慈母之心，做事慷慨大方；他们甚至扯到了大块牛肉和楼下厨房里的旺火。话音一到唇边就微弱得听不清了，最后化为轻轻的叹息。寒冷的夜空里突然传来一声大叫：“上帝呀！”没有人移动位置，也没有人在意这叫声。一两个人将手伸到面前，重复打着莫名其妙的手势，但多数人纹丝不动。他们身体麻木，行动不便，各种思绪梦幻般袭来，生动形象，弄得他们十分疲惫。他们不时猛然发出一声惊叫，似乎在回答梦幻中怪异的招呼；然后又陷入沉默，仿佛在回忆熟人的面孔和熟悉的事情。他们记起了遗忘船友的容貌，听到了已故船长的声音。他们回想起了煤气灯照耀下街道的喧嚣，酒吧间蒸汽弥漫的闷热，以及风平浪静时海上似火的骄阳。</td>
		<td class="en">The icy south wind howled exultingly under the sombre splendour of the sky.The cold shook the men with a resistless violence as though it had tried to shake them to pieces.Short moans were swept unheard off the stiff lips.Some complained in mutters of “not feeling themselves below the waist;” while those who had closed their eyes, imagined they had a block of ice on their chests.Others, alarmed at not feeling any pain in their fingers, beat the deck feebly with their hands—obstinate and exhausted.Wamibo stared vacant and dreamy.The Scandinavians kept on a meaningless mutter through chattering teeth.The spare Scotchmen, with determined efforts, kept their lower jaws still.The West-country men lay big and stolid in an invulnerable surliness.A man yawned and swore in turns.Another breathed with a rattle in his throat.Two elderly hard-weather shellbacks, fast side by side, whispered dismally to one another about the landlady of a boarding-house in Sunderland, whom they both knew.They extolled her motherliness and her liberality; they tried to talk about the joint of beef and the big fire in the downstairs kitchen.The words dying faintly on their lips, ended in light sighs.A sudden voice cried into the cold night, “O Lord!” No one changed his position or took any notice of the cry.One or two passed, with a repeated and vague gesture, their hand over their faces, but most of them kept very still.In the benumbed immobility of their bodies they were excessively wearied by their thoughts, which rushed with the rapidity and vividness of dreams.Now and then, by an abrupt and startling exclamation, they answered the weird hail of some illusion; then, again, in silence contemplated the vision of known faces and familiar things.They recalled the aspect of forgotten shipmates and heard the voice of dead and gone skippers.They remembered the noise of gaslit streets, the steamy heat of tap-rooms or the scorching sunshine of calm days at sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >贝克先生离开他那不安全的处所，沿着船尾楼爬一下，停一会儿。他在黑暗中爬行，仿佛某些食肉动物在尸堆里徘徊。在陡峭的边沿，他倚在一根柱子的上风处，向下查看主甲板。他发现轮船似乎还能再多坚持一会儿。风已经有所变缓，他想，但海浪仍然和以前一样涌得很高。波涛恶意地泛起白沫，下风一侧的甲板浸没在嘶嘶作响的白沫里，仿佛浸没在沸腾的牛奶中，绳索在深沉震颤的音调伴奏下不停地唱着，而轮船每次向上浮动时，风都会拉长声音，在桅桁中使劲吹。贝克先生静静地观察着。他旁边的一个人嘴唇颤动，发出啵啵的声响，那声音既突然又响亮，好像寒冷凶残地刺破了他的身体。那人的嘴不停抖动：“吧——吧——吧——啵——吧——吧。”“别响啦！”贝克先生在黑暗中一边摸索，一边嚷嚷道。“别响啦！”他摸到了一条腿，不住地晃了起来。“怎么了，先生？”贝尔法斯特叫道，那声音听起来像突然惊醒的样子，“我们正在这儿照料吉米。”“是吗？咳！那就别嚷嚷啦。挨着你的是谁？”“是我——水手长，先生，”西乡人大声答道，“我们要想法保住这个可怜虫的命。”　“哦，哦！”贝克先生说，“你们能安静点吗？”“他要我们把他抬到围栏上，”水手长忿恨地接着说道，“他说我们的夹克把他捂得透不过气。”“要是把他举起来，我们会把他掉到海里去的，”另外一个人说道，“我们的手已经冻得麻木了。”“我不管。我要窒息啦！”詹姆斯·韦特叫道，声音十分清晰。“哦，别这样，孩子，”水手长绝望地说，“这么好的晚上，我们走之前，你可千万别走。”“你会见到比这更糟的。”贝克先生兴奋地说。“这可不是小孩子闹着玩哩，先生！”水手长答道。“我们后面船尾部的几位可真够倒霉的。”　“要是这些该死的木杆早就砍倒的话，这艘船就会像其他漂亮的船一样正常行驶了，我们大家也都会得到好运。”有人叹着气说道。“老头子不允许……他真关心我们。”又一个人低声说道。“关心你们！”贝克先生气愤地嚷嚷道，“他为什么要关心你们？难道你们是一群需要照顾的女乘客吗？我们在这儿是照顾船的——可你们中的一些人连这一点也不明白。咳！……你们干了什么了不起的事值得被别人关心？咳！你们中有些人受点小罪就大吵大嚷的。”“得了吧，先生。我们没有这么差劲吧，”贝尔法斯特辩解道，因哆嗦声音有些颤抖，“我们不至于……啵……”“又来了，”大副一边说着，一边去抓那黑乎乎的人影，“又来了！……哎呀，你就穿件衬衫！你干什么啦？”“我把我的雨衣和夹克都盖在了这个半死的黑鬼身上了——可他说他要闷死。”贝尔法斯特抱怨道。“我要不是半死的话，你也不会叫我黑鬼，你这爱尔兰乞丐！”詹姆斯·韦特瓮声瓮气地说，显得精力十足。“你……啵……你就是身体再好，也不是白人……天气好的话……啵……我非揍你不可……啵……一只手反绑在背后……啵……?”“我才不稀罕你的破布——我需要空气。”另一位喘着气无力地说，仿佛气力突然衰竭了。浪花席卷而过，发出哗啦哗啦的声响。人们在平静的麻木状态中受到恼人的吵闹声惊扰，他们抱怨着，低声咒骂着。贝克先生向下风处爬去，那里隐隐约约呈现出一个大水桶，有个白色的东西紧紧挨着它。“是你吗，波德莫尔？”贝克先生问道。他不得不问了两次，厨子才轻轻地咳嗽着转过头。“是啊，先生。我心里在祈祷，想早点解脱；我已经准备好了，随时等候召唤……我——”“你瞧，厨子，”贝克先生打断厨子的话，“这些人都快被冻死了。”“冻死！”厨子凄惨地说道，“不久他们都会得到足够温暖的。”“什么？”贝克先生问道，眼睛顺着甲板注视着泛着泡沫的海水发出的微光。“他们是一群恶人，”厨子郑重地继续说道，但声音有些起伏，“像这个世界上任何一艘船上的水手一样坏。现在，我——”他哆嗦着，话都几乎讲不下去了；他呆在一个毫无遮蔽的地方，穿着一件布衬衣，一条薄裤子，双膝放在鼻子下，浑身颤抖，任凭咸水滴刺骨般的敲打；他的声音听起来十分疲惫——“现在。我——随时……我的大儿子，贝克先生……一个聪明的孩子……这次航行前在岸上的最后一个礼拜天，他不愿去教堂，先生。我说，‘你去向主忏悔，不去的话，我可知道是咋回事！’你猜他干了些什么？……池塘，贝克先生——穿着他最好的衣服掉进了池塘，先生！……意外？……‘什么也救不了你，尽管你是个好学生！’我说……真是意外！……我抽了他一顿，先生，直到打得我抬不起胳膊……”他的声音有些发抖。“我抽了他一顿！”他又说了一遍，牙齿咯吱直响；过了一会儿，他悲伤地叫了一声，这声音像是呻吟，又像是打鼾。贝克先生晃了晃他的肩膀。“喂！厨子！打起精神来，波德莫尔！告诉我——厨房水箱里还有淡水没有？轮船斜得没那么厉害了，我想；我得到前面去。有点水会对他们大有好处的。喂！小心！小心！”厨子挣扎着。“你可别去，先生——你可别去！”他开始向上风爬去。“厨房……我的事！”他大声说。“厨子要疯了。”大家异口同声说道。他嚷嚷道：“我疯了，是吗？对于死，我比你们谁都有思想准备，包括长官——绝对！只要船浮一天，我就坚持做一天饭！我给你们弄咖啡去。”“厨子，你是真正的男子汉！”贝尔法斯特叫道。可是厨子已经走过上风扶梯了。他又停了片刻，回过头来对着船尾楼大声喊道：——“只要船浮着，我就坚持给大家做饭！”喊罢就消失了，好像掉到海里去了。听到这话的人们欢呼着送他离去，那欢呼声听着就像病儿的哀号。一个多小时之后，有人肯定地说道：“他这一走就再也回不来啦。”“很有可能，”水手长附和道，“就是在好天，他在甲板上走路的姿态也不比一头初航的奶牛好多少。我们应该去看看。”　可谁也没动。黑暗中，时间慢慢地一小时一小时走过，贝克先生沿着船尾楼来来回回爬了好几次。有些人恍惚觉得听到了他与船长低声商量了些什么，但那时记忆远比实际的东西生动得多，因此他们不敢肯定那低语声是现在听到的还是多年前听到的。他们也不想弄明白。悄悄话多说点少说点无关紧要。奇寒的天气激不起好奇心甚至于希望。求生欲占据了他们的整个大脑，他们抽不出片刻空闲，也无心考虑其他事情。正是求生的欲望，才使他们在面对残忍顽固的狂风和严寒时，能够保持生气、刚毅和坚韧；此时，挂满星星的穹隆般黑色夜空在船上方缓慢旋转，船儿承载着他们的忍耐与痛苦，飘过了大海狂暴的寂寞。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Baker left his insecure place, and crawled, with stoppages, along the poop.In the dark and on all fours he resembled some carnivorous animal prowling amongst corpses.At the break, propped to windward of a stanchion, he looked down on the main deck.It seemed to him that the ship had a tendency to stand up a little more.The wind had eased a little, he thought, but the sea ran as high as ever.The waves foamed viciously, and the lee side of the deck disappeared under a hissing whiteness as of boiling milk, while the rigging sang steadily with a deep vibrating note, and, at every upward swing of the ship, the wind rushed with a long-drawn clamour amongst the spars.Mr. Baker watched very still.A man near him began to make a blabbing noise with his lips, all at once and very loud, as though the cold had broken brutally through him.He went on:—“Ba—ba—ba—brrr—brr—ba—ba.”—“Stop that!” cried Mr. Baker, groping in the dark.“Stop it!”He went on shaking the leg he found under his hand.—“What is it, sir?” called out Belfast, in the tone of a man awakened suddenly; “we are looking after that ’ere Jimmy.”—“Are you?Ough!Don’t make that row then.Who’s that near you?”—“It’s me—the boatswain, sir,” growled the West-country man; “we are trying to keep life in that poor devil.”—“Aye, aye!” said Mr. Baker.“Do it quietly, can’t you?”—“He wants us to hold him up above the rail,” went on the boatswain, with irritation, “says he can’t breathe here under our jackets.”—“If we lift ’im, we drop ’im overboard,” said another voice, “we can’t feel our hands with cold.”—“I don’t care.I am choking!” exclaimed James Wait in a clear tone.—“Oh, no, my son,” said the boatswain, desperately, “you don’t go till we all go on this fine night.”—“You will see yet many a worse,” said Mr. Baker, cheerfully.—“It’s no child’s play, sir!” answered the boatswain.“Some of us further aft, here, are in a pretty bad way.”—“If the blamed sticks had been cut out of her she would be running along on her bottom now like any decent ship, an’ giv’ us all a chance,” said some one, with a sigh.—“The old man wouldn’t have it...much he cares for us,” whispered another.—“Care for you!” exclaimed Mr. Baker, angrily.“Why should he care for you?Are you a lot of women passengers to be taken care of?We are here to take care of the ship—and some of you ain’t up to that.Ough!...What have you done so very smart to be taken care of?Ough!...Some of you can’t stand a bit of a breeze without crying over it.”—“Come, sorr.We ain’t so bad,” protested Belfast, in a voice shaken by shivers; “we ain’t...Brr...”—“Again,“ shouted the mate, grabbing at the shadowy form; “again!...Why, you’re in your shirt!What have you done?”—“I’ve put my oilskin and jacket over that half-dead nayggur—and he says he chokes,“ said Belfast, complainingly.—“You wouldn’t call me nigger if I wasn’t half dead, you Irish beggar!” boomed James Wait, vigorously.—“You...brrr...You wouldn’t be white if you were ever so well...I will fight you...brrrr...in fine weather...brrr...with one hand tied behind my back...Brrrrrr...”—“I don’t want your rags—I want air,” gasped out the other faintly, as if suddenly exhausted.The sprays swept over whistling and pattering.Men disturbed in their peaceful torpor by the pain of quarrelsome shouts, moaned, muttering curses.Mr. Baker crawled off a little way to leeward where a water-cask loomed up big, with something white against it.“Is it you, Podmore?” asked Mr. Baker. He had to repeat the question twice before the cook turned, coughing feebly.—“Yes, sir.I’ve been praying in my mind for a quick deliverance; for I am prepared for any call....I———”—“Look here, cook,” interrupted Mr. Baker, “the men are perishing with cold.”—“Cold!” said the cook, mournfully; “they will be warm enough before long.”—“What?” asked Mr. Baker, looking along the deck into the faint sheen of frothing water.—“They are a wicked lot,” continued the cook solemnly, but in an unsteady voice, “about as wicked as any ship’s company in this sinful world!Now, I”—he trembled so that he could hardly speak; his was an exposed place, and in a cotton shirt, a thin pair of trousers, and with his knees under his nose, he received, quaking, the flicks of stinging, salt drops; his voice sounded exhausted—“now.I—any time...My eldest youngster, Mr. Baker.. a clever boy...last Sunday on shore before this voyage he wouldn’t go to church, sir.Says I, ‘You go and clean yourself, or I’ll know the reason why!’What does he do?...Pond, Mr. Baker—fell into the pond in his best rig, sir!...Accident?...‘Nothing will save you, fine scholar though you are!’ says I....Accident!...I whopped him, sir, till I couldn’t lift my arm....” His voice faltered.“I whopped ’im!” he repeated, rattling his teeth; then, after a while, let out a mournful sound that was half a groan, half a snore.Mr. Baker shook him by the shoulders.“Hey! Cook!Hold up, Podmore!Tell me—is there any fresh water in the galley tank?The ship is lying along less, I think; I would try to get forward.A little water would do them good.Hallo!Look out!Look out!” The cook struggled.—“Not you, sir—not you!” He began to scramble to windward.“Galley!...my business!” he shouted.—“Cook’s going crazy now,” said several voices.He yelled:—“Crazy, am I?I am more ready to die than any of you, officers incloosive—there!As long as she swims I will cook!I will get you coffee.”—“Cook, ye are a gentleman!” cried Belfast.But the cook was already going over the weather-ladder.He stopped for a moment to shout back on the poop:—“As long as she swims I will cook!” and disappeared as though he had gone overboard.The men who had heard sent after him a cheer that sounded like a wail of sick children.An hour or more afterwards some one said distinctly: “He’s gone for good.”—“Very likely,” assented the boatswain; “even in fine weather he was as smart about the deck as a milch-cow on her first voyage.We ought to go and see.” Nobody moved.As the hours dragged slowly through the darkness Mr. Baker crawled back and forth along the poop several times.Some men fancied they had heard him exchange murmurs with the master, but at that time the memories were incomparably more vivid than anything actual, and they were not certain whether the murmurs were heard now or many years ago.They did not try to find out.A mutter more or less did not matter.It was too cold for curiosity, and almost for hope.They could not spare a moment or a thought from the great mental occupation of wishing to live.And the desire of life kept them alive, apathetic and enduring, under the cruel persistence of wind and cold; while the bestarred black dome of the sky revolved slowly above the ship, that drifted, bearing their patience and their suffering, through the stormy solitude of the sea.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Huddled close to one another, they fancied themselves utterly alone.They heard sustained loud noises, and again bore the pain of existence through long hours of profound silence.In the night they saw sunshine, felt warmth, and suddenly, with a start, thought that the sun would never rise upon a freezing world.Some heard laughter, listened to songs; others, near the end of the poop, could hear loud human shrieks, and opening their eyes, were surprised to hear them still, though very faint, and far away.The boatswain said:—“Why, it’s the cook, hailing from forward, I think.” He hardly believed his own words or recognised his own voice.It was a long time before the man next to him gave a sign of life.He punched hard his other neighbour and said:—“The cook’s shouting!” Many did not understand, others did not care; the majority further aft did not believe.But the boatswain and another man had the pluck to crawl away forward to see.They seemed to have been gone for hours, and were very soon forgotten.Then suddenly men who had been plunged in a hopeless resignation became as if possessed with a desire to hurt.They belaboured one another with fists.In the darkness they struck persistently anything soft they could feel near, and, with a greater effort than for a shout, whispered excitedly:—“They’ve got some hot coffee....Boss’en got it....” “No!...Where?”....“It’s coming!Cook made it.” James Wait moaned.Donkin scrambled viciously, caring not where he kicked, and anxious that the officers should have none of it.It came in a pot, and they drank in turns.It was hot, and while it blistered the greedy palates, it seemed incredible.The men sighed out parting with the mug:—“How ’as he done it?” Some cried weakly:—“Bully for you, doctor!”He had done it somehow.Afterwards Archie declared that the thing was “meeraculous.” For many days we wondered, and it was the one ever-interesting subject of conversation to the end of the voyage.We asked the cook, in fine weather, how he felt when he saw his stove “reared up on end.” We inquired, in the north-east trade and on serene evenings, whether he had to stand on his head to put things right somewhat.We suggested he had used his bread-board for a raft, and from there comfortably had stoked his grate; and we did our best to conceal our admiration under the wit of fine irony.He affirmed not to know anything about it, rebuked our levity, declared himself, with solemn animation, to have been the object of a special mercy for the saving of our unholy lives.Fundamentally he was right, no doubt; but he need not have been so offensively positive about it—he need not have hinted so often that it would have gone hard with us had he not been there, meritorious and pure, to receive the inspiration and the strength for the work of grace.Had we been saved by his recklessness or his agility, we could have at length become reconciled to the fact; but to admit our obligation to anybody’s virtue and holiness alone was as difficult for us as for any other handful of mankind.Like many benefactors of humanity, the cook took himself too seriously, and reaped the reward of irreverence.We were not un-ungrateful, however.He remained heroic.His saying——the— saying of his life—became proverbial in the mouth of men as are the sayings of conquerors or sages.Later, whenever one of us was puzzled by a task and advised to relinquish it, he would express his determination to persevere and to succeed by the words:—“As long as she swims I will cook!”</td></tr>

Captain Allistoun let go the rope he had round his wrist and rolled to leeward headlong.He could be seen casting the lee main braces off the pins while the backwash of waves splashed over him.—“Square the main yard!” he shouted up to us—who stared at him in wonder.We hesitated to stir.“The main brace, men.Haul! haul anyhow!Lay on your backs and haul!” he screeched, half drowned down there.We did not believe we could move the main yard, but the strongest and the less discouraged tried to execute the order.Others assisted half-heartedly.Singleton’s eyes blazed suddenly as he took a fresh grip of the spokes.Captain Allistoun fought his way up to windward.—“Haul, men!Try to move it!Haul, and help the ship.”His hard face worked suffused and furious.“Is she going off, Singleton?” he cried.—“Not a move yet, sir,” croaked the old seaman in a horribly hoarse voice.—“Watch the helm, Singleton,” spluttered the master.“Haul, men!Have you no more strength than rats?Haul, and earn your salt.” Mr. Creigh-ton, on his back, with a swollen leg and a face as white as a piece of paper, blinked his eyes; his bluish lips twitched.In the wild scramble men grabbed at him, crawled over his hurt leg, knelt on his chest.He kept perfectly still, setting his teeth without a moan, without a sigh.The master’s ardour, the cries of that silent man inspired us.We hauled and hung in bunches on the rope.We heard him say with violence to Donkin, who sprawled abjectly on his stomach,—“I will brain you with this belaying pin if you don’t catch hold of the brace,” and that victim of men’s injustice, cowardly and cheeky, whimpered:—“Are you goin’ to murder us now?” while with sudden desperation he gripped the rope.Men sighed, shouted, hissed meaningless words, groaned.The yards moved, came slowly square against the wind, that hummed loudly on the yard-arms.—“Going off, sir,” shouted Singleton, “she’s just started.”—“Catch a turn with that brace.Catch a turn!” clamoured the master.Mr. Creighton, nearly suffocated and unable to move, made a mighty effort, and with his left hand managed to nip the rope.—</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The master and Mr. Baker coming face to face stared for a moment, with the intense and amazed looks of men meeting unexpectedly after years of trouble.Their voices were gone, and they whispered desperately at one another.—“Any one missing?” asked Captain Allistoun.—“No.All there.”—“Anybody hurt?”—“Only the second mate.”—“I will look after him directly.We’re lucky.”—“Very,” articulated Mr. Baker, faintly.He gripped the rail and rolled bloodshot eyes.The little grey man made an effort to raise his voice above a dull mutter, and fixed his chief mate with a cold gaze, piercing like a dart.—“Get sail on the ship,” he said, speaking authoritatively and with an inflexible snap of his thin lips.“Get sail on her as soon as you can.This is a fair wind.At once, sir—Don’t give the men time to feel themselves.They will get done up and stiff, and we will never...We must get her along now”...He reeled to a long heavy roll; the rail dipped into the glancing, hissing water.He caught a shroud, swung helplessly against the mate...“now we have a fair wind at last———Make———sail.”His head rolled from shoulder to shoulder.His eyelids began to beat rapidly.“And the pumps———pumps, Mr. Baker.” He peered as though the face within a foot of his eyes had been half a mile off.“Keep the men on the move to———to get her along,” he mumbled in a drowsy tone, like a man going off into a doze.He pulled himself together suddenly.“Mustn’t stand.Won’t do,” he said with a painful attempt at a smile.He let go his hold, and, propelled by the dip of the ship, ran aft unwillingly, with small steps, till he brought up against the binnacle stand.Hanging on there he looked up in an aimless manner at Singleton, who, unheeding him, watched anxiously the end of the jib-boom—“Steering gear works all right?” he asked.There was a noise in the old seaman’s throat, as though the words had been rattling together before they could come out.—“Steers...like a little boat,” he said, at last, with hoarse tenderness, without giving the master as much as half a glance—then, watchfully, spun the wheel down, steadied, flung it back again.Captain Allistoun tore himself away from the delight of leaning against the binnacle, and began to walk the poop, swaying and reeling to preserve his balance....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >主桅根部的飞轮平稳地高速旋转，泵杆小幅度上下起伏，叮当作响，带着两组紧紧抓住拉手的、筋疲力尽的船员前后不停地猛烈摇摆。他们不顾自己的安危，臀部以上来回摇动，面部肌肉抽搐，两眼发直。木匠不时地测着水深，嘴里机械地惊叫道：“让船振作起来！让她走呀！”　贝克先生再也不能心平气和地讲话了，他发现自己在吼叫；在他训斥声的鞭策下，人们只得去照看索具，拖出新帆；他们心想，动都动不了啦，可还得把滑轮搬到高处——以便详细检查传动装置。他们哆哆嗦嗦，拼命地攀爬着绳子。手在不住变换着抓绳的部位，脚胡乱地踩在帆桁上，仿佛黑暗中的行人，人人感到头晕眼花；筋疲力尽时，便漫不经心地将身体靠在手边的绳子上。尽管摇摇欲坠，他们的心却没事似的无力地跳着；身下远处海浪的咆哮不绝于耳，但又隐隐约约，仿佛是来自另一世界的模糊声音：风吹得他们满眼流泪，剧烈时，甚至想把他们从摇摆不定的危险之处刮下去。只见他们脸上泪汗纵横，头发东倒西歪，在水天之间上下翻飞；他们有的骑跨在桁臂末端，有的蜷缩在踏脚索上，有的双腿夹紧吊索，腾出双手，还有人紧靠锁链，直起身来。他们的思想模糊地游弋于安息与生存的愿望之间，他们用僵直的手指解开帆顶耳索，笨手笨脚地摸找小刀，或者紧紧抓住绳索，抵御那不断拍打着的帆布的疯狂进攻。他们彼此凶狠地注视着，一只手打着疯狂的手势，另一只手把握住自己的性命，俯视着被淹没的一窄条甲板，顺风叫道：“往前递绳！”…… “把帆拉开！” ……“系紧！”他们的嘴唇鼓动着，眼睛睁得大大的，愤怒而急切，期盼别人明白自己的意思，但话还没等让人听见，就被风吹到沸腾的大海上去了。在难以忍受、无休无止的重压下，他们宛如被无情梦魇驱使着工作的人们，在冰与火的环境里做着苦工。他们一阵发烧，一阵哆嗦。他们的眼球酸痛，好像在大火中受过烟熏一样；每叫喊一声，头颅仿佛就要炸裂开来。似乎有坚硬的魔爪掐住了他们的喉咙。船的每次震动，他们都会想：这次肯定完了。它会把我们全掀到海里去的——他们横七竖八地挂在空中，疯狂地叫道：“小心——抓住绳头。”…… “把绳子穿好”…… “转动这个滑轮”……他们时而拼命地点着头；时而晃着愤怒的脸，“不！不！从下往上穿。”　他们彼此之间似乎恨得咬牙切齿。什么都不愿管的想法啮噬着他们的心，而把事情干好的愿望又像火一般灼烫着他们。他们诅咒着自己的命运，谴责着他们的非人生活，不惜耗费精力彼此咒骂。修帆工裸露着秃头，忙乱地干着活，忘掉了和许多海军上将的亲密友谊。水手长带了几把索针和几根粗捻的细索油麻绳往上爬，或者跪在帆桁上，准备顺便绕到船中部桅顶凸木上去，他脑海里不时闪现出生活在荒野村庄里的老婆和孩子的幻影。贝克先生感到身体十分虚弱，一歪一扭地随处走着，嘴里哼哼唧唧却又非常顽强，像铁人似的。他拦住那些刚从高处下来站着喘气的人们。他对他们或命令，或鼓励，或责备。“喂——现在该收拾主桅上桅帆了！拉紧那根桅顶吊索。别站在那儿晃来晃去！”“难道我们就不能歇一会儿吗？”几个人嘟囔道。他猛然转过身来，很是失望。“不行！活不干完不能歇。干到爬不起来为止。要你们来这儿来就是为了干活。”他肘旁一位弓着腰的海员噗嗤笑了一声。“要么干活，要么死。”他用嘶哑的声音痛苦地说着，然后，向手心里吐口唾沫，扬起他那两条长臂，抓住头顶上的绳子，发出一声哀号，让大家一起拉。一个大浪冲上了后甲板，驱赶着全体人员爬到下风去。帽子，绞盘棒都漂在了水中。透过发出哗哗响声的白色泡沫，可以看到紧握着的手，乱踢乱蹬着的腿，随处可见溅满白色水沫的脸。贝克先生和大家一起摔倒了，他尖叫道：“别松开绳子！抓紧！抓紧！”虽然受到绳子残忍地抽打，他们还是紧紧抓住了它，仿佛它是他们生命的一切。船儿剧烈震动着向前飞奔，高耸的波峰扫过船的左右两弦，峰顶白光闪闪。抽水泵工作完成了。转桁索穿过了滑轮。三面上桅帆和前桅帆张开了。船在水上快速行驶着，把奔腾的海浪甩在了后面。在她身后，远方传来海浪雷鸣般的可怕吼声——这声音引起的巨大震动弥漫在空气中。好像是为追求某种高尚事业的勇气所激励，在饱受蹂躏、折磨和创伤之后，她又劈波斩浪向北疾驶……</td>
		<td class="en">The pump-rods, clanking, stamped in short jumps while the fly-wheels turned smoothly, with great speed, at the foot of the mainmast, flinging back and forth with a regular impetuosity two limp clusters of men clinging to the handles.They abandoned themselves, swaying from the hip with twitching faces and stony eyes.The carpenter, sounding from time to time, exclaimed mechanically: “Shake her up!Keep her going!”Mr. Baker could not speak, but found his voice to shout; and under the goad of his objurgations, men looked to the lashings, dragged out new sails; and thinking themselves unable to move, carried heavy blocks aloft—overhauled the gear.They went up the rigging with faltering and desperate efforts.Their heads swam as they shifted their hold, stepped blindly on the yards like men in the dark; or trusted themselves to the first rope at hand with the negligence of exhausted strength.The narrow escapes from falls did not disturb the languid beat of their hearts; the roar of the seas seething far below them sounded continuous and faint like an indistinct noise from another world: the wind filled their eyes with tears, and with heavy gusts tried to push them off from where they swayed in insecure positions.With streaming faces and blowing hair they flew up and down between sky and water, bestriding the ends of yard-arms, crouching on foot-ropes, embracing lifts to have their hands free, or standing up against chain ties.Their thoughts floated vaguely between the desire of rest and the desire of life, while their stiffened fingers cast off head-earrings, fumbled for knives, or held with tenacious grip against the violent shocks of beating canvas.They glared savagely at one another, made frantic signs with one hand while they held their life in the other, looked down on the narrow strip of flooded deck, shouted along to leeward: “Light-to!”...“Haul out!”...“Make fast!” Their lips moved, their eyes started, furious and eager with the desire to be understood, but the wind tossed their words unheard upon the disturbed sea.In an unendurable and unending strain they worked like men driven by a merciless dream to toil in an atmosphere of ice or flame.They burnt and shivered in turns.Their eyeballs smarted as if in the smoke of a conflagration; their heads were ready to burst with every shout.Hard fingers seemed to grip their throats.At every roll they thought:Now I must let go.It will shake us all off—and thrown about aloft they cried wildly: “Look out there—catch the end.”...“Reeve clear”...“Turn this block....”They nodded desperately; shook infuriated faces, “No!No!From down up.” They seemed to hate one another with a deadly hate. The longing to be done with it all gnawed their breasts, and the wish to do things well was a burning pain.They cursed their fate, contemned their life, and wasted their breath in deadly imprecations upon one another.’ The sailmaker, with his bald head bared, worked feverishly, forgetting his intimacy with so many admirals.The boatswain, climbing up with marlinspikes and bunches of spunyarn rovings, or kneeling on the yard and ready to take a turn with the midship-stop, had acute and fleeting visions of his old woman and the youngsters in a moorland village.Mr. Baker, feeling very weak, tottered here and there, grunting and inflexible, like a man of iron.He waylaid those who, coming from aloft, stood gasping for breath.He ordered, encouraged, scolded.“Now then—to the main topsail now!Tally on to that gantline.Don’t stand about there!”—“Is there no rest for us?” muttered voices.He spun round fiercely, with a sinking heart.—“No!No rest till the work is done.Work till you drop.That’s what you’re here for.” A bowed seaman at his elbow gave a short laugh.—“Do or die,” he croaked bitterly, then spat into his broad palms, swung up his long arms, and grasping the rope high above his head sent out a mournful, wailing cry for a pull all together.A sea boarded the quarter-deck and sent the whole lot sprawling to leeward.Caps, handspikes floated.Clenched hands, kicking legs, with here and there a spluttering face, stuck out of the white hiss of foaming water.Mr. Baker, knocked down with the rest, screamed—“Don’t let go that rope!Hold on to it!Hold!” And sorely bruised by the brutal fling, they held on to it, as though it had been the fortune of their life.The ship ran, rolling heavily, and the topping crests glanced past port and starboard flashing their white heads.Pumps were freed.Braces were rove.The three topsails and foresail were set. She spurted faster over the water, outpacing the swift rush of waves.The menacing thunder of distanced seas rose behind her—filled the air with the tremendous vibrations of its voice.And devastated, battered, and wounded she drove foaming to the northward, as though inspired by the courage of a high endeavour....</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The forecastle was a place of damp desolation.They looked at their dwelling with dismay.It was slimy, dripping; it hummed hollow with the wind, and was strewn with shapeless wreckage like a half-tide cavern in a rocky and exposed coast.Many had lost all they had in the world, but most of the starboard watch had preserved their chests; thin streams of water trickled out of them, however.The beds were soaked; the blankets spread out and saved by some nail squashed under foot.They dragged wet rags from evil-smelling corners, and wringing the water out, recognised their property.Some smiled stiffly.Others looked round blank and mute.There were cries of joy over old waistcoats, and groans of sorrow over shapeless things found among the splinters of smashed bed boards.One lamp was discovered jammed under the bowsprit.Charley whimpered a little.Knowles stumped here and there, sniffing, examining dark places for salvage.He poured dirty water out of a boot, and was concerned to find the owner.Those who, overwhelmed by their losses, sat on the forepeak hatch, remained elbows on knees, and, with a fist against each cheek, disdained to look up.He pushed it under their noses.“Here’s a good boot.Yours?” They snarled, “No—get out.” One snapped at him, “Take it to hell out of this.” He seemed surprised.“Why? It’s a good boot,” but remembering suddenly that he had lost every stitch of his clothing, he dropped his find and began to swear.In the dim light cursing voices clashed.A man came in and, dropping his arms, stood still, repeating from the doorstep, “Here’s a bloomin’ old go!Here’s a bloomin’ old go!” A few rooted anxiously in flooded chests for tobacco.They breathed hard, clamoured with heads down.“Look at that Jack!”...“Here! Sam!Here’s my shore-going rig spoilt for ever.” One blasphemed tearfully, holding up a pair of dripping trousers.No one looked at him.The cat came out from somewhere.He had an ovation.They snatched him from hand to hand, caressed him in a murmur of pet names.They wondered where he had “weathered it out;” disputed about it.A squabbling argument began.Two men brought in a bucket of fresh water, and all crowded round it; but Tom, lean and mewing, came up with every hair astir and had the first drink.A couple of hands went aft for oil and biscuits.</td></tr>



“给你，威尔士人——拿去吧，你这贼！”“多谢啦！”黑暗中传来了他的叫喊声，这声音盖过了滚滚海水的嗖嗖声。可以听到他正甩去身上的海水；一个大浪重重地打在船上。“他这次可洗了个痛快澡。”一个尖刻的老水手说道。“哦，哦！”其他人哼哼唧唧附和着。经过长时间的沉默，沃米博发出了奇怪的声音。“喂，咋回事？”有人暴躁地问道。“他说他应该替戴维斯去。”老给芬兰人当翻译的阿奇解释道。“我相信他的话！”几个声音嚷嚷道……“没关系，外国佬……会轮到你的，糊涂蛋……马上轮到你去值班……现在舒舒服服的，倒是不知好歹。”　大家住了嘴，一齐把脸转向门口。辛格尔顿走了进来，往前跨了两步，颤巍巍地站住了。海水嘶嘶作响，咆哮着冲过船头，水手舱在颤动，充满了各种深沉的杂音；灯光闪耀，仿佛钟摆在不停地摇摆。他用梦幻般迷惑的眼神注视着周围，仿佛分辨不清静止的人和晃动的影子。不时有人惊恐地叫喊：“喂，喂”……“外面现在情况怎么样，辛格尔顿？”坐在舱口盖上的人们默默地抬起眼睛，船上年龄仅次于辛格尔顿的老海员（他俩虽然一天也说不上三句话，但彼此十分理解）注视了他的朋友片刻，把他那根短短的土烟斗从嘴里取出，啥话也没说，递了过去。辛格尔顿伸手去接，可没接住，踉踉跄跄，突然身体前倾，直直地摔倒在地，头部朝前，就像一棵连根拔起的大树。大家立刻涌上前去。众人你推我挤，嚷嚷道：“他不行啦！”……“把他的身体翻过来！” ……“站远一点！”一群人脸上带着惊慌神情俯视着他，他仰面朝天躺着，眼睛一眨不眨，样子十分难受。正当大家惊慌失措，屏息不语的时候，他用沙哑的声音说道：“我没事。”接着紧紧攥住自己的双手。他们扶他起来。他沮丧地嘟哝道：“我一天天老了……老了。”“你可一点不老。”贝尔法斯特非常机灵地随口答道。在众人搀扶下，他耷拉着头。“好点了吗？”他们问道。他睫毛下那双黑黑的大眼睛打量着大家，他那浓密的白胡子又长又厚直飘胸前。“老啦！老啦！”他坚定地重复着。在别人的一路搀扶下，他走到了自己的铺前。铺上是一堆滑腻的软东西，闻着就像泥泞的海滩上浅浅的死水发出的气味。这便是他那被水浸过的草床。他猛地使了一下劲，才倒在床上，在这黑暗狭窄的地方，只听他愤怒地嘟囔着，仿佛一头被激怒的野兽困在洞中，十分不安：“一点微风……小事……受不了啦……老啦！”他终于睡着了，脚上穿着皮靴，头上戴着防水帽，当他深深地叹息呻吟着翻身时，身上的油布雨衣沙沙作响。出于关心，人们小声地议论着他。“这回可能把他压垮了”……“过去一直像牛一样健壮”……“唉。现在他可比不得从前啦。”他们难过地谈论着，慢慢话题就岔开了。可是，半夜时分他又去值班了，好像什么事都没发生过；点到他的名字时，他凄楚地应道“在！”他比以前更常想心事，独自一人默不作声的样子令人费解，面部表情极度悲伤。多少年来，他经常听到别人叫他“老辛格尔顿”，也就心安理得地接受了这种称呼，认为这是对他的敬意。因为像他这样的人，半个世纪以来，一直与喜怒无常的大海打交道。可他从来没有为作为凡人的自己考虑过。他曾屈服于种种诱惑，经历过无数风暴，可身上未曾留下任何伤痕，好像是坚不可摧的。他在烈日下喘过气，在严寒中发过抖；忍受过饥渴放荡之苦；经历过无数磨难——早已明白各种狂风暴雨。老啦！在他看来，自己彻底垮了。就像一个熟睡中的人中了奸计，被人捆绑了起来，他醒时发现自己被蹉跎岁月的长链锁住了。他不得不立刻承担起自己生命的全部重担，但却发现担子太重，承担不了。老啦！他甩甩胳膊，摇摇头，晃晃四肢。一天天变老了……以后咋办呢？他头脑清醒了，望着永恒的大海，深深地认识到了它的无情威力；他发现大海不曾改变，在群星永久的注视下，黑沉沉的，泛着泡沫；他听见大海在用焦躁的声音召唤他，那声音来自于巨大的，充满不安、混乱和恐惧的无情世界。他向远方眺望，只见茫茫一片，无边无际，充满了痛苦与愚昧，悲伤与肆虐，这片大海夺去了他顽强生活过的所有日子，而当他生命终结之时，还要夺去他那奴隶般销蚀的躯壳……</td>
		<td class="en">Then in the yellow light and in the intervals of mopping the deck they crunched hard bread, arranging to “worry through somehow.” Men chummed as to beds.Turns were settled for wearing boots and having the use of oilskin coats.They called one another “old man” and “sonny” in cheery voices.Friendly slaps resounded.Jokes were shouted.One or two stretched on the wet deck, slept with heads pillowed on their bent arms, and several, sitting on the hatch, smoked.Their weary faces appeared through a thin blue haze, pacified and with sparkling eyes.The boatswain put his head through the door.“Relieve the wheel, one of you”—he shouted inside—“it’s six.Blamme if that old Singleton hasn’t been there more’n thirty hours.You are a fine lot.” He slammed the door again.“Mate’s watch on deck,” said some one.“Hey, Donkin, it’s your relief!” shouted three or four together.He had crawled into an empty bunk and on wet planks lay still.“Donkin, your wheel.” He made no sound.“Donkin’s dead,” guffawed some one, “Sell ’is bloomin’ clothes,” shouted another.“Donkin, if ye don’t go to the bloomin’ wheel they will sell your clothes—d’ye hear?” jeered a third.He groaned from his dark hole.He complained about pains in all his bones, he whimpered pitifully.“He won’t go,” exclaimed a contemptuous voice, “your turn, Davis.” The young seaman rose painfully, squaring his shoulders.Donkin stuck his head out, and it appeared in the yellow light, fragile and ghastly.“I will giv’ yer a pound of tobaccer,” he whined in a conciliating voice, “so soon as I draw it from aft.I will—s’elp me...” Davis swung his arm backhanded and the head vanished.“I’ll go,” he said, “but you will pay for it.” He walked unsteady but resolute to the door.“So I will,” yelped Donkin, popping out behind him.“So I will—s’elp me...a pound...three bob they chawrge.” Davis flung the door open.“You will pay my price...in fine weather,” he shouted over his shoulder.One of the men unbuttoned his wet coat rapidly, threw it at his head.“Here, Taffy—take that, you thief!” “Thank you!” he cried from the darkness above the swish of rolling water.He could be heard splashing; a sea came on board with a thump.“He’s got his bath already,” remarked a grim shellback.“Aye, aye!” grunted others.Then, after a long silence, Wamibo made strange noises.“Hallo, what’s up with you?” said some one grumpily.“He says he would have gone for Davy,” explained Archie, who was the Finn’s interpreter generally.“I believe him!“ cried voices....“Never mind, Dutchy...You’ll do, muddle-head....Your turn will come soon enough...You don’t know when ye’re well off.” They ceased, and all together turned their faces to the door.Singleton stepped in, advanced two paces, and stood swaying slightly.The sea hissed, flowed roaring past the bows, and the forecastle trembled, full of deep murmurs; the lamp flared, swinging like a pendulum.He looked with a dreamy and puzzled stare, as though he could not distinguish the still men from their restless shadows.There were awestruck exclamations:—“Hallo, hallo”...“How does it look outside now, Singleton?” Those who sat on the hatch lifted their eyes in silence, and the next oldest seaman in the ship (those two understood one another, though they hardly exchanged three words in a day) gazed up at his friend attentively for a moment, then taking a short clay pipe out of his mouth, offered it without a word.Singleton put out his arm towards it, missed, staggered, and suddenly fell forward, crashing down, stiff and headlong like an uprooted tree.There was a swift rush.Men pushed, crying:—“He’s done!”...“Turn him over!”...“Stand clear there!” Under a crowd of startled faces bending over him he lay on his back, staring upwards in a continuous and intolerable manner.In the breathless silence of a general consternation, he said in a grating murmur:—“I am all right,” and clutched with his hands.They helped him up.He mumbled despondently:—“I am getting old...old.”—“Not you,” cried Belfast, with ready tact.Supported on all sides, he hung his head.—“Are you better?”they asked.He glared at them from under his eyebrows with large black eyes, spreading over his chest the bushy whiteness of a beard long and thick.—“Old!old!” he repeated sternly.Helped along, he reached his bunk.There was in it a slimy soft heap of something that smelt, as does at dead low water a muddy foreshore.It was his soaked straw bed.With a convulsive effort he pitched himself on it, and in the darkness of the narrow place could be heard growling angrily, like an irritated and savage animal uneasy in its den:—“Bit of breeze...small thing...can’t stand up...old!”He slept at last, high-booted, sou’wester on head, and his oilskin clothes rustled, when with a deep sighing groan he turned over.Men conversed about him in quiet, concerned whispers.“This will break’im up”...“Strong as a horse”...“Aye. But he ain’t what he used to be.”In sad murmurs they gave him up.Yet at midnight he turned out to duty as if nothing had been the matter, and answered to his name with a mournful “Here!”He brooded alone more than ever, in an impenetrable silence and with a saddened face.For many years he had heard himself called “Old Singleton,” and had serenely accepted the qualification, taking it as a tribute of respect due to a man who through half a century had measured his strength against the favours and the rages of the sea.He had never given a thought to his mortal self.He lived unscathed, as though he had been indestructible, surrendering to all the temptations, weathering many gales.He had panted in sunshine, shivered in the cold; suffered hunger, thirst, debauch; passed through many trials—known all the furies.Old! It seemed to him he was broken at last.And like a man bound treacherously while he sleeps, he woke up fettered by the long chain of disregarded years.He had to take up at once the burden of all his existence, and found it almost too heavy for his strength.Old! He moved his arms, shook his head, felt his limbs.Getting old...and then?He looked upon the immortal sea with the awakened and groping perception of its heartless might; he saw it unchanged, black and foaming under the eternal scrutiny of the stars; he heard its impatient voice calling for him out of a pitiless vastness full of unrest, of turmoil, and of terror.He looked afar upon it, and he saw an immensity tormented and blind, moaning and furious, that claimed all the days of his tenacious life, and, when life was over, would claim the worn-out body of its slave....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是最后一丝微风。风向快速转换，变成了强劲的东南风，顺势推着船儿向北航行，进入到令人欢欣、阳光灿烂的信风带。白色的船儿在蔚蓝的天空下，在风平浪静的碧蓝海面上，沿着笔直的航道向着老家方向快速行驶。她载着辛格尔顿完整的智慧、唐金脆弱的情感和我们所有人的自负与愚昧。无聊打闹的时刻被人们忘在了脑后；这些黑暗的瞬间带来的恐惧和痛苦，在这明媚宁静的日子里再也无人提起。此时此刻，我们似乎开始了新的生活，仿佛死而复生。就像前世留给人们的猜测一样，航行的前一阶段——好望角东侧印度洋里的航行——全部消失在了阴霾之中。这段航程已经结束——然后是一段空白时段：一段灰白色的模糊的时光——而我们再次获得了新生！辛格尔顿收获了残酷的真相；克赖顿先生伤了一条腿；厨子得到了好名声——他竟不知羞耻地滥用荣誉给他带来的种种机会。唐金平添了更多不满。不管到哪儿他都要重复那句话：“他说他要砸烂我的头——你们都听见了吧？他们现在为鸡毛蒜皮的小事就想要我们的命。”最终，我们也觉着这确实可怕。其实，我们也很自负！我们夸耀我们的勇气，工作能力和精力。我们念念不忘那些荣耀的往事：我们的忠诚，我们的坚强意志——以此为荣，好像它们是我们不靠外力、自觉努力的结果。我们牢牢记住我们的危险境遇，我们的艰辛劳作——并顺势忘记了我们有过的巨大恐惧。我们诽谤上司——他们什么事情都不干——却听信唐金信口雌黄。他关心我们的权利，他无私地维护我们的尊严，他从不因我们一贯对他进行言辞上的侮辱和神情上的蔑视而气馁。我们极度鄙视他——可又禁不住怀着极大兴趣听这位艺术家天衣无缝的编造。他告诉我们说我们都是好人——一群“令人讨厌的该受谴责的好人。”谁会感谢我们呢？谁会关注我们受到的不公待遇呢？难道我们不是为了一个月两磅十先令而过着“猪狗不如的生活”吗？　难道我们认为那点少得可怜的工钱就足以补偿我们，让我们去卖命，去丢掉衣服？“我们丢得连一片布都没有啦！”他嚷嚷道。他让我们忘掉了这一点：不管怎么说，他什么也没丢。年轻人们边听边想——唐金这小子真是精明人，虽然也不完全说得上。两个斯堪的纳维亚人对他的狂妄深感惊讶；沃米博不明白他的话；两位老水手若有所思地点点头，晃得他们毛茸茸、厚墩墩耳垂上的金色薄耳环闪闪发光。一副副晒黑的严肃面孔，托在饰有纹身的前臂上沉思着。青筋突出的褐色拳头紧握着黑黢黢的冒着青烟的白黏土烟斗。大家伸着背，曲着肩，一声不吭地静静听着，可咋也听不明白。他激情满怀，滔滔不绝，大家看不起他，却也无法反驳他。他那绘声绘色、猥亵不堪的饶舌，宛如一条流自毒源的泛滥溪流。他那珠子般的小眼睛跳来跳去，左顾右盼，提防着上司的出现。偶尔，贝克先生去查看船头的帆脚索，拖着笨重脚步路过时，大家会突然安静下来；或者，克赖顿先生一瘸一拐地经过，年轻光滑的脸显得比以前更加严厉；清澈的眼睛发出犀利的光芒，一眼就看透了我们短暂的沉默。克赖顿一走，唐金又开始偷偷地斜着眼睛使眼色：“又一个。那天你们几个把他捆得真够结实的。你们得到重谢了吧。他不是把你们赶得更紧了吗……？让他滚到海里去……为什么不呢？这样麻烦不就少多了。为什么不呢？”他秘密地提出建议，博得了大家的赞许；他时而低声细语，时而高声尖叫，挥舞着他那可怜的不比烟袋管粗的胳膊——伸着细细的脖子——喷着唾沫斜着眼。在他激情演讲的间歇，风在高处轻轻叹息，平静得无人注意的大海沿着船边窃窃私语，似乎在警告什么。我们憎恶这家伙，但又不可否认他论点中无可辩驳的事实。这些再清楚不过了。毋庸置疑，我们都是好人；我们功劳显著，而报酬却微乎其微。我们拼着命拯救了这艘船，而船长却得到了全部荣誉。他到底干了些什么？我们倒想请教。唐金问道：“没有我们他能干什么？”谁也无法回答。我们一直受着世间不公正待遇的压迫；在这种负担下这么久竟浑然不知自己的悲惨境遇，这着实令我们吃惊；我们惴惴不安地怀疑自己是否愚蠢到不辨是非的地步，这又给我们平添了一层烦恼。唐金笃定地告诉我们这都是因为我们“心眼太好”，但我们并不能从他这种浅薄的诡辩中得到丝毫安慰。我们这些人有足够的勇气承认我们在智力上存在缺陷。打那时起，我们就不再去踢他，拧他的鼻子，或者有意无意撞他。在经历了好望角风暴之后，最后那项成了大家最喜欢的消遣。戴维斯不再说黑眼珠和塌鼻子这类令他不快的话。风暴过后，查利也收敛许多，不再讥讽他。诺尔斯恭恭敬敬，神情诡谲地提出一些问题，比如：“我们大家能否和大副二副他们吃得一样好？拿不到工钱，我们能不下海吗？要是我们拿到了，下一步该干什么？”对于这些问题，他显得不屑一顾，回答得从容肯定；他志得意满，踱来踱去；他穿的衣服太大，好像故意要显摆自己。这些衣服多半是吉米的——虽然他愿意接受任何人的东西，可除了吉米，谁都没有多余的。他对吉米无限忠诚。他老是躲在那间小屋里照料吉米的起居，迎合他的怪念头，顺从他吹毛求疵的坏脾气，陪他一块儿大笑。谁也阻止不了他探访病人的虔诚行为，尤其是甲板上有繁重的拖拉搬运之类的工作时。贝克先生有两次抓着他的领子把他从那儿使劲揪了出来，激起了我们内心极大的不满。怎么能让一个病人留在那儿无人照顾呢？怎么能虐待一个照看船友的人？“什么？”贝克先生听到这些牢骚后，转过身，恶狠狠地吼道，结果，围着的半圈人像是一个人似的一起向后退了一步。“张中桅辅助帆。爬到高处去，唐金，仔细检查一下滑轮，”大副果断命令道，“把帆拉过来，将落帆索盘好。搭把手。” 等帆张好后，他慢步来到船尾，站在那儿凝视了罗盘好一阵子，只见他疲惫不堪，神情忧郁，呼吸急促，仿佛那弥漫于船上莫名其妙的敌意让他窒息。“他们中间出了什么事？”他想，“真不明白他们干吗闪烁其词，嘀嘀咕咕。这年头，这伙人的表现已经不错了。”　唐金发完牢骚之后过了很久，大家还是会对一些不公而又难以挽回的蠢事——这些事不可否认——咒骂几句，小声议论议论。我们这个小小的世界，载着一个充满不满和抱负的群体向前驶去，道路曲折，但始终不偏离航向。他们无休止地认真分析着自己不被赏识的价值，从中找到了一丝黯淡的慰藉；他们为唐金那充满希望的说辞所鼓舞，狂热地梦想着自己的未来，到时候，航行在宁静大海上的每艘孤独的船，都由他们这些腰缠万贯、吃饱喝足、踌躇满志的船长们驾驶。</td>
		<td class="en">This was the last of the breeze.It veered quickly, changed to a black south-easter, and blew itself out, giving the ship a famous shove to the northward into the joyous sunshine of the trade.Rapid and white she ran homewards in a straight path, under a blue sky and upon the plain of a blue sea.She carried Singleton’s completed wisdom, Donkin’s delicate susceptibilities, and the conceited folly of us all.The hours of ineffective turmoil were forgotten; the fear and anguish of these dark moments were never mentioned in the glowing peace of fine days.Yet from that time our life seemed to start afresh as though we had died and had been resuscitated.All the first part of the voyage, the Indian Ocean on the other side of the Cape, all that was lost in a haze, like an ineradicable suspicion of some previous existence.It had ended—then there were blank hours: a livid blurr—and again we lived!Singleton was possessed of sinister truth; Mr. Creighton of a damaged leg; the cook of fame—and shamefully abused the opportunities of his distinction.Donkin had an added grievance.He went about repeating with insistence:—“’E said ’e would brain me—did yer ’ear?They are goin’ to murder us now for the least little thing.” We began at last to think it was rather awful.And we were conceited!We boasted of our pluck, of our capacity for work, of our energy.We remembered honourable episodes: our devotion, our indomitable perseverance—and were proud of them as though they had been the outcome of our unaided impulses.We remembered our danger, our toil—and conveniently forgot our horrible scare.We decried our officers—who had done nothing—and listened to the fascinating Donkin.His care for our rights, his disinterested concern for our dignity, were not discouraged by the invariable contumely of our words, by the disdain of our looks.Our contempt for him was unbounded—and we could not but listen with interest to that consummate artist.He told us we were good men—a “bloomin’ condemned lot of good men.” Who thanked us?Who took any notice of our wrongs?Didn’t we lead a “dorg’s loife for two poun’ ten a month?” Did we think that miserable pay enough to compensate us for the risk to our lives and for the loss of our clothes?“We’ve lost every rag!” he cried.He made us forget that he, at any rate, had lost nothing of his own.The younger men listened, thinking—this ’ere Donkin’s a long-headed chap, though no kind of man, anyhow.The Scandinavians were frightened at his audacities; Wamibo did not understand; and the older seamen thoughtfully nodded their heads making the thin gold earrings glitter in the fleshy lobes of hairy ears.Severe, sunburnt faces were propped meditatively on tattooed forearms.Veined, brown fists held in their knotted grip the dirty white clay of smouldering pipes.They listened, impenetrable, broad-backed, with bent shoulders, and in grim silence.He talked with ardour, despised and irrefutable.His picturesque and filthy loquacity flowed like a troubled stream from a poisoned source.His beady little eyes danced, glancing right and left, ever on the watch for the approach of an officer.Sometimes Mr. Baker going forward to take a look at the head sheets would roll with his uncouth gait through the sudden stillness of the men; or Mr. Creighton limped along, smooth-faced, youthful, and more stern than ever, piercing our short silence with a keen glance of his clear eyes.Behind his back Donkin would begin again darting stealthy, sidelong looks.—“’Ere’s one of ’em. Some of yer ’as made ’im fast that day. Much thanks yer got for it.Ain’t ’ee a-drivin’ yer wusse’n ever?...Let ’im slip overboard....Vy not?It would ’ave been less trouble.Vy not?” He advanced confidentially, backed away with great effect; he whispered, he screamed, waved his miserable arms no thicker than pipe-stems—stretched his lean neck—spluttered squinted.In the pauses of his impassioned orations the wind sighed quietly aloft, the calm sea unheeded murmured in a warning whisper along the ship’s side.We abominated the creature and could not deny the luminous truth of his contentions.It was all so obvious.We were indubitably good men; our deserts were great and our pay small.Through our exertions we had saved the ship and the skipper would get the credit of it.What had he done?we wanted to know.Donkin asked:—“What ’ee could do without hus?” and we could not answer.We were oppressed by the injustice of the world, surprised to perceive how long we had lived under its burden without realising our unfortunate state, annoyed by the uneasy suspicion of our undiscerning stupidity.Donkin assured us it was all our “good ’eartedness,” but we would not be consoled by such shallow sophistry.We were men enough to courageously admit to ourselves our intellectual shortcomings; though from that time we refrained from kicking him, tweaking his nose, or from accidentally knocking him about, which last, after we had weathered the Cape, had been rather a popular amusement.Davis ceased to talk at him provokingly about black eyes and flattened noses.Charley, much subdued since the gale, did not jeer at him.Knowles deferentially and with a crafty air propounded questions such as:—“Could we all have the same grub as the mates?Could we all stop ashore till we got it?What would be the next thing to try for if we got that?” He answered readily with contemptuous certitude; he strutted with assurance in clothes that were much too big for him as though he had tried to disguise himself.These were Jimmy’s clothes mostly—though he would accept anything from anybody; but nobody, except Jimmy, had anything to spare.His devotion to Jimmy was unbounded.He was for ever dodging in the little cabin, ministering to Jimmy’s wants, humouring his whims, submitting to his exacting peevishness, often laughing with him.Nothing could keep him away from the pious work of visiting the sick, especially when there was some heavy hauling to be done on deck.Mr. Baker had on two occasions jerked him out from there by the scruff of the neck to our inexpressible scandal.Was a sick chap to be left without attendance?Were we to be ill-used for attending a shipmate?—“What?” growled Mr. Baker, turning menacingly at the mutter, and the whole half-circle like one man stepped back a pace.“Set the topmast stunsail.Away aloft, Donkin, overhaul the gear,” ordered the mate inflexibly.“Fetch the sail along; bend the down-haul clear.Bear a hand.” Then, the sail set, he would go slowly aft and stand looking at the compass for a long time, careworn, pensive, and breathing hard as if stifled by the taint of unaccountable ill-will that pervaded the ship.“What’s up amongst them?” he thought.“Can’t make out this hanging back and growling.A good crowd, too, as they go nowadays.” On deck the men exchanged bitter words, suggested by a silly exasperation against something unjust and irremediable that would not be denied, and would whisper into their ears long after Donkin had ceased speaking.Our little world went on its curved and unswerving path carrying a discontented and aspiring population.They found comfort of a gloomy kind in an interminable and conscientious analysis of their unappreciated worth; and inspired by Donkin’s hopeful doctrines they dreamed enthusiastically of the time when every lonely ship would travel over a serene sea, manned by a wealthy and well-fed crew of satisfied skippers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这次航行似乎十分漫长。轻柔、无常的东南信风被抛在了身后；赤道上，低矮的灰色天空下，轮船被热浪包围着，漂浮在如玻璃般平滑的海面上。雷声回荡在水天交界处，绕着船，但又保持较远距离；它愤怒地吼叫着，仿佛一群野兽还不敢立即发起猛烈进攻。被乌云遮住的太阳，扫过笔直的桅杆，在乌云上留下了一块没有光芒的模糊亮斑，还有一块相似的淡淡光痕，它们自东向西与太阳同步俯瞰着暗淡的海面。夜里，透过这难以穿透的天地间的黑暗，一片片巨大的火焰无声无息地摇动着；刹那间，平静的船连同它的桅帆索具，漆黑而轮廓分明地显现在突然爆发的火焰中，仿佛是困在火球里的一艘烧焦的船。接下来的一段很长时间里，她一直隐没在黑夜和寂静所构成的巨大宇宙中，轻微的叹息声就像孤独的灵魂传遍各处，使得静止的帆篷仿佛受了惊吓抖动起来，被黑夜笼罩的涟漪在远处低声诉说着它的慈悲——声音是那样的悲凉、悠远、微弱……</td>
		<td class="en">It looked-as if it would be a long passage.The south-east trades, light and unsteady, were left behind; and then, on the equator and under a low grey sky, the ship, in close heat, floated upon a smooth sea that resembled a sheet of ground glass.Thunder squalls hung on the horizon, circled round the ship, far off and growling angrily, like a troop of wild beasts afraid to charge home.The invisible sun, sweeping above the upright masts, made on the clouds a blurred stain of rayless light, and a similar patch of faded radiance kept pace with it from east to west over the unglittering level of the waters.At night, through the impenetrable darkness of earth and, heaven, broad sheets of flame waved noiselessly; and for half a second the becalmed craft stood out with its masts and rigging, with every sail and every rope distinct and black in the centre of a fiery outburst, like a charred ship enclosed in a globe of fire.And, again, for long hours she remained lost in a vast universe of night and silence where gentle sighs wandering here and there like forlorn souls, made the still sails flutter as in sudden fear, and the ripple of a beshrouded ocean whisper its compassion afar—in a voice mournful, immense, and faint....</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When the lamp was put out, and through the door thrown wide open, Jimmy, turning on his pillow, could see vanishing beyond the straight line of top-gallant rail, the quick, repeated visions of a fabulous world made up of leaping fire and sleeping water.The lightning gleamed in his big sad eyes that seemed in a red flicker to burn themselves out in his black face, and then he would lie blinded and invisible in the midst of an intense darkness.He could hear on the quiet deck soft footfalls, the breathing of some man lounging on the doorstep; the low creak of swaying masts; or the calm voice of the watch-officer reverberating aloft, hard and loud, amongst the unstirring sails.He listened with avidity, taking a rest in the attentive perception of the slightest sound from the fatiguing wanderings of his sleeplessness.He was cheered by the rattling of blocks, reassured by the stir and murmur of the watch, soothed by the slow yawn of some sleepy and weary seaman settling himself deliberately for a snooze on the planks.Life seemed an indestructible thing.It went on in darkness, in sunshine, in sleep; tireless, it hovered affectionately round the imposture of his ready death.It was bright, like the twisted flare of lightning, and more full of surprises than the dark night.It made him safe, and the calm of its overpowering darkness was as precious as its restless and dangerous light.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But in the evening, in the dog-watches, and even far into the first night-watch, a knot of men could always be seen congregated before Jimmy’s cabin.They leaned on each side of the door peacefully interested and with crossed legs; they stood astride the doorstep discoursing, or sat in silent couples on his sea-chest; while against the bulwark along the spare topmast, three or four in a row stared meditatively; with their simple faces lit up by the projected glare of Jimmy’s lamp.The little place, repainted white, had, in the night, the brilliance of a silver shrine where a black idol, reclining stiffly under a blanket, blinked its weary eyes and received our homage.Donkin officiated.He had the air of a demonstrator showing a phenomenon, a manifestation bizarre, simple, and meritorious that, to the beholders, should be a profound and an everlasting lesson.“Just look at ’im, ’ee knows what’s what—never fear!” he exclaimed now and then, flourishing a hand hard and fleshless like the claw of a snipe.Jimmy, on his back, smiled with reserve and without moving a limb.He affected the languor of extreme weakness, so as to make it manifest to us that our delay in hauling him out from his horrible confinement, and then that night spent on the poop among our selfish neglect of his needs, had “done for him.” He rather liked to talk about it, and of course we were always interested.He spoke spasmodically, in fast rushes with long pauses between, as a tipsy man walks....“Cook had just given me a pannikin of hot coffee....Slapped it down there, on my chest—banged the door to....I felt a heavy roll coming; tried to save my coffee, burnt my fingers...and fell out of my bunk....She went over so quick....Water came in through the ventilator....I couldn’t move the door...dark as a grave...tried to scramble up into the upper berth....Rats...a rat bit my finger as I got up....I could hear him swimming below me....I thought you would never come...I thought you were all gone overboard...of course...Could hear nothing but the wind....Then you came...to look for the corpse, I suppose.A little more and...”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Gradually the tramping noises, the confused sound of voices, died out, and the officers, coming together on the poop, discussed the events.Mr. Baker was bewildered and grunted; Mr. Creighton was calmly furious; but Captain Allistoun was composed and thoughtful.He; listened to Mr. Baker’s growling argumentation, to Creighton’s interjected and severe remarks, while look-’ ing down on the deck he weighed in his hand the iron belaying-pin—that a moment ago had just missed his head—as if it had been the only tangible fact of the whole transaction.He was one of those commanders who speak little, seem to hear nothing, look at no one—and know everything, hear every whisper, see every fleeting shadow of their ship’s life.His two big officers towered above his lean, short figure; they talked over his head; they were dismayed, surprised, and angry, while between them the little quiet man seemed to have found his taciturn serenity in the profound depths of a larger experience.Lights were burning in the forecastle; now and then a loud gust of babbling chatter came from forward, swept over the decks, and became faint, as if the unconscious ship, gliding gently through the great peace of the sea, had left behind and for ever the foolish noise of turbulent mankind.But it was renewed again and again.Gesticulating arms, profiles of heads with open mouths appeared for a moment in the illuminated squares of doorways; black fists darted—withdrew...“Yes.It was most damnable to have such an unprovoked row sprung on one,” assented the master....A tumult of yells rose in the light, abruptly ceased....He didn’t think there would be any further trouble just then....A bell was struck aft, another, forward, answered in a deeper tone, and the clamour of ringing metal spread round the ship in a circle of wide vibrations that ebbed away into the immeasurable night of an empty sea....Didn’t he know them!Didn’t he!In past years.Better men, too.Real men to stand by one in a tight place.Worse than devils too sometimes—downright, horned devils.Pah! This—nothing.A miss as good as a mile....The wheel was being relieved in the usual way.—“Full and by,” said, very loud, the man going off.—“Full and by,” repeated the other, catching hold of the spokes.—“This head wind is my trouble,” exclaimed the master, stamping his foot in sudden anger; “head wind!all the rest is nothing.” He was calm again in a moment.“Keep them on the move to-night, gentlemen; just to let them feel we’ve got hold all the time—quietly, you know.Mind you keep your hands off them, Creighton.To-morrow I will talk to them like a Dutch Uncle.A crazy crowd of tinkers!Yes, tinkers!I could count the real sailors amongst them on the fingers of one hand.Nothing will do but a row—if—you—please.” He paused.“Did you think I had gone wrong there, Mr. Baker?” He tapped his forehead, laughed short.“When I saw him standing there, three parts dead and so scared—black amongst that gaping lot—no grit to face what’s coming to us all—the notion came to me all at once, before I could think.Sorry for him—like you would be for a sick brute.If ever creature was in a mortal funk to die!...I thought I would let him go out in his own way.Kind of impulse.It never came into my head, those fools....H’m! Stand to it now—of course.” He stuck the belaying-pin in his pocket, seemed ashamed of himself, then sharply:—“If you see Podmore at his tricks again tell him I will have him put under the pump.Had to do it once before.The fellow breaks out like that now and then.Good cook tho’.” He walked away quickly, came back to the companion.The two mates followed him through the starlight with amazed eyes.He went down three steps, and changing his tone, spoke with his head near the deck:—“I shan’t turn in to-night, in case of anything; just call out if...Did you see the eyes of that sick nigger, Mr. Baker?I fancied he begged me for something.What? Past all help.One lone black beggar amongst the lot of us, and he seemed to look through me into the very hell.Fancy, this wretched Podmore!Well, let him die in peace.I am master here after all.Let him be.He might have been half a man once...Keep a good look-out.” He disappeared down below, leaving his mates facing one another, and more impressed than if they had seen a stone image shed a miraculous tear of compassion over the incertitudes of life and death....</td></tr>

A short fellow with a thick clipped beard kept on yelling periodically:—“Who’s afeard?Who’s afeard?” Another one jumped up, excited, with blazing eyes, sent out a string of unattached curses and sat down quietly.Two men discussed familiarly, striking one another’s breast in turn, to clinch arguments.Three others, with their heads in a bunch, spoke all together with a confidential air, and at the top of their voices.It was a stormy chaos of speech where intelligible fragments tossing, struck the ear.One could hear:—“In the last ship”—“Who cares?Try it on any one of us if———-.”</td></tr>

The noise subsided like a broken wave: but Belfast cried once more with uplifted arms:—“The man is dying I tell ye!” then sat down suddenly on the hatch and took his head between his hands.All looked at Singleton, gazing upwards from the deck, staring out of dark corners, or turning their heads with curious glances.They were expectant and appeased as if that old man, who looked at no one, had possessed the secret of their uneasy indignations and desires, a sharper vision, a clearer knowledge.And indeed standing there amongst them, he had the uninterested appearance of one who had seen multitudes of ships, had listened many times to voices such as theirs, had already seen all that could happen on the wide seas.They heard his voice rumble in his broad chest as though the words had been rolling towards them out of a rugged past.“What do you want to do?” he asked.No one answered.Only Knowles muttered—“Aye, aye,” and somebody said low:—“It’s a bloomin’ shame.” He waited, made a contemptuous gesture.—“I have seen rows aboard ship before some of you were born,” he said, slowly, “for something or nothing; but never for such a thing.”—“The man is dying, I tell ye,” repeated Belfast, woefully, sitting at Singleton’s feet.—“And a black fellow, too,” went on the old seaman, “I have seen them die like flies.” He stopped, thoughtful, as if trying to recollect gruesome things, details of horrors, hecatombs of niggers.They looked at him fascinated.He was old enough to remember slavers, bloody mutinies, pirates perhaps; who could tell through what violences and terrors he had lived!What would he say?He said:—“You can’t help him; die he must.” He made another pause.His moustache and beard stirred.He chewed words, mumbled behind tangled white hairs; incomprehensible and exciting, like an oracle behind a veil....—“Stop ashore———sick.———-Instead———bringing all this head wind.Afraid.

Go faster.”—“Don’t yer ‘it me....I will pull yer up afore the magistryt....I’ll show yer up.” Captain Allistoun made a long stride, and Donkin, turning his back fairly, ran off a little, then stopped and over his shoulder showed yellow teeth.—“Further on, fore-rigging,” urged the master, pointing with his arm.—“Are yer goin’ to stand by and see me bullied?” screamed Donkin at the silent crowd that watched him.Captain Allistoun walked at him smartly.He started off again with a leap, dashed at the fore-rigging, rammed the pin into its hole violently.“I’ll be even with yer yet,” he screamed at the ship at large and vanished beyond the foremast.Captain Allistoun spun round and walked back aft with a composed face, as though he had already forgotten the scene.Men moved out of his way.He looked at no one.—“That will do, Mr. Baker.Send the watch below,” he said, quietly.“And you men try to walk straight for the future,” he added in a calm voice.He looked pensively for a while at the backs of the impressed and retreating crowd.“Breakfast, steward,” he called in a tone of relief through the cabin door.—“I didn’t like to see you—Ough!—give that pin to that chap, sir,” observed Mr. Baker; “he could have bust—Ough!—bust your head like an eggshell with it.”—“O! he!” muttered the master, absently.“Queer lot,” he went on in a low voice，“I suppose it’s all right now.Can never tell tho‘ nowadays, with such a...Years ago; I was a young master then—one China voyage I had a mutiny; real mutiny, Baker.Different men tho’.I knew what they wanted: they wanted to broach the cargo and get at the liquor.Very simple....We knocked them about for two days, and when they had enough—gentle as lambs.Good crew.And a smart trip I made.” He glanced aloft at the yards braced sharp up.“Head wind day after day,” he exclaimed, bitterly.“Shall we never get a decent slant this passage?”—“Ready, sir,” said the steward, appearing before them as if by magic and with a stained napkin in his hand.—“Ah!All right.Come along, Mr. Baker—it’s late—with all this nonsense.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阴沉寂静的氛围笼罩着轮船，令人压抑。下午人们忙着洗衣服，洗完后挂在微风中晾干，人人都像初醒的哲学家，沉思冥想，无精打采。很少听到有人说话。对于范围狭窄的人类语言来说，生命问题似乎过于浩瀚，于是人们普遍认为，自开天辟地以来，这个问题就被抛给了无垠的大海，大海早已把它纳入了自己巨大的掌控之中；大海无所不知，迟早要准确无误地揭开朦胧的面纱，让每个人看到隐藏在一切谬误中的智慧，潜伏在疑问中的真相，以及跨越悲伤与恐惧边界的安全与和平的领域。混杂在一起的各种胡思乱想，在人们体内不停地四处横流，这时，吉米浮出了水面，十分惹人注意，仿佛一个系在污浊河底的黑色浮标。虚伪取得了胜利。它的获胜凭借的是怀疑、愚昧、怜悯和感伤。出于同情、轻率和取乐，我们主动支持了他的这种虚伪。吉米在不可改变的事实面前表现出的不屈不挠的虚伪态度，简直是惊天之谜——宏大、费解，有时甚至能够引起人们的好奇与敬畏；同时，在许多人看来，对他这种极致的虚伪打趣逗乐也妙不可言。人们为了避免看他死去带来的痛苦，对这个遭受病痛折磨的人更加温柔体贴，其实，这是潜在的利己主义。我们眼睁睁地看着他的大限这一惟一事实一天天临近，可他却极为倔强，偏不承认，这正如大自然某条规律失灵一样，着实令人不安。他在自己的事情上错得这么严重，人们不禁怀疑他是否有超自然的本能。他甚至荒谬到认为自己受了神的启示。他是那样的独一无二，只有超人的事物才能像他一样让人神魂颠倒；他似乎已经超越了那可怕的边界，在另一边疾呼他的反对意见。他正在脱离形骸，变得幽灵一般；他的颧骨高高凸起，额头更加瘦削；面部肌肉凹陷，形成块块阴影；消瘦的脑袋酷似地下挖出的黑骷髅，眼眶中装着两颗不停打转的银灰色眼球。他令人泄气。有了他，我们变得更加慈悲、温和、圆滑，而且也极度消沉：我们懂得了他恐惧的微妙，理解了他所有的厌恶、畏缩、逃避和虚幻——仿佛我们过于世故、堕落，丝毫不懂生活的意义。我们的神态像是被传授了一些龌龊的秘密；我们扮着同谋者之间寓意深刻的怪相，交换着意味深长的眼神和简短而重要的话语。我们卑鄙得无法言表，可内心却乐不可支。我们使用甜言蜜语，郑重其事、感情真挚地对他撒谎，仿佛运用这种道德欺诈手段，是为了获取永恒报酬似的。对他的狂言，我们齐声附和，好像他是百万富翁、政客，或者改革者——而我们是一群野心勃勃的笨蛋。有时我们壮着胆子对他的话语提出质疑，可我们总是摆出阿谀奉承之人的谄媚姿态，结果，这种异议却成了奉承，反而进一步增加了他的荣耀。他左右着我们这个世界的道德观，仿佛他掌控着给我们分配荣誉、财富或痛苦的权力；事实上，他除了蔑视，什么也不曾给过我们。他的蔑视无边无际；我们眼看着他的身体一天天萎缩，而这种蔑视似乎却在逐渐壮大。这是关于他——也是属于他——的惟一能给人留下持久与活力印象的东西。它扎根于他内心深处，具有顽强的生命。它通过那永远撅起的黑唇表达自我；它通过那呆滞硕大的眼睛流露的无礼悲凄注地视着我们。我们专心致志地守护着他。他似乎不愿活动，好像怀疑自己身体的健康。极其轻微的动作也能表现出他身体的虚弱（当然他也绝不会做出其他的动作），由此引起一阵精神痛苦。他对自己的举动非常小心。他躺在床上，四肢打开，下巴贴在毛毯上，一动不动，显得诡秘、谨慎。只有他的目光在人们的面部游弋：鄙夷、锐利、忧伤。</td>
		<td class="en">A heavy atmosphere of oppressive quietude pervaded the ship.In the afternoon men went about washing clothes and hanging them out to dry in the unprosperous breeze with the meditative languor of disenchanted philosophers.Very little was said.The problem of life seemed too voluminous for the narrow limits of human speech, and by common consent it was abandoned to the great sea that had from the beginning enfolded it in its immense grip; to the sea that knew all, and would in time infallibly unveil to each the wisdom hidden in all the errors, the certitude that lurks in doubts, the realm of safety and peace beyond the frontiers of sorrow and fear.And in the confused current of impotent thoughts that set unceasingly this way and that through bodies of men, Jimmy bobbed up upon the surface, compelling attention, like a black buoy chained to the bottom of a muddy stream.Falsehood triumphed.It triumphed through doubt, through stupidity, through pity, through sentimentalism.We set ourselves to bolster it up from compassion, from recklessness, from a sense of fun. Jimmy’s steadfastness to his untruthful attitude in the face of the inevitable truth had the proportions of a colossal enigma—of a manifestation grand and incomprehensible that at times inspired a wondering awe; and there was also, to many, something exquisitely droll in fooling him thus to the top of his bent.The latent egoism of tenderness to suffering appeared in the developing anxiety not to see him die. His obstinate non-recognition of the only certitude whose approach we could watch from day to day was as disquieting as the failure of some law of nature.He was so utterly wrong about himself that one could not but suspect him of having access to some source of supernatural knowledge.He was absurd to the point of inspiration.He was unique, and as fascinating as only something inhuman could be; he seemed to shout his denials already from beyond the awful border.He was becoming immaterial like an apparition; his cheekbones rose, the forehead slanted more; the face was all hollows, patches of shade; and the fleshless head resembled a disinterred black skull, fitted with two restless globes of silver in the sockets of eyes.He was demoralising.Through him we were becoming highly humanised, tender, complex, excessively decadent: we understood the subtlety of his fear, sympathised with all his repulsions, shrinkings, evasions, delusions—as though we had been over-civilised, and rotten, and without any knowledge of the meaning of life.We had the air of being initiated in some infamous mysteries; we had the profound grimaces of conspirators, exchanged meaning glances, significant short words.We were inexpressibly vile and very much pleased with ourselves.We lied to him with gravity, with emotion, with unction, as if performing some moral trick with a view to an eternal reward.We made a chorus of affirmation to his wildest assertions, as though he had been a millionaire, a politician, or a reformer—and we a crowd of ambitious lubbers.When we ventured to question his statements we did it after the manner of obsequious sycophants, to the end that his glory should be augmented by the flattery of our dissent.He influenced the moral tone of our world as though he had it in his power to distribute honours, treasures, or pain; and he could give us nothing but his contempt.It was immense; it seemed to grow gradually larger, as his body day by day shrank a little more, while we looked.It was the only thing about him—of him—that gave the impression of durability and vigour.It lived within him with an unquenchable life.It spoke through the eternal pout of his black lips; it looked at us through the impertinent mournfulness of his languid and enormous stare.We watched him intently.He seemed unwilling to move, as if distrustful of his own solidity.The slightest gesture must have disclosed to him (it could not surely be otherwise) his bodily weakness, and caused a pang of mental suffering.He was chary of movements.He lay stretched out, chin on blanket, in a kind of sly, cautious immobility.Only his eyes roamed over faces: his eyes disdainful, penetrating and sad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就是在这个时候，贝尔法斯特的忠诚——还有他的好斗——赢得了普遍尊重。他把所有的空闲时间都花在了吉米的小屋内。他照顾吉米，和吉米聊天；像女人一样温柔，像老慈善家一样体贴热情，像模范奴隶主一样，从感情上关心他的黑奴。可一到舱外，他就变得十分暴躁，像火药一样一触即炸，他阴沉忧郁，疑神疑鬼，悲伤之时比其他任何时候都更加凶残。他有的只是眼泪和拳头：眼泪为吉米而流，而拳头任何人都有份——只要他在吉米的问题上不够谨慎，未能持有正统的观点。我们别的事情一概不谈。就连那两位斯堪的纳维亚人也议论起了当时的情形——可无法了解他们是什么看法，因为他们用自己的语言争论。贝尔法斯特怀疑他二人中间有一人不敬，可无法确定，既然别无选择，干脆就一起攻击。他们被他的野蛮态度吓坏了，自此，呆在我们中间垂头丧气，活像一对哑巴。沃米博什么时候讲话都让人费解，脸上没有一丝笑容，活像一头畜牲——似乎不比那只猫懂得多——结果倒是很安全。再说，他属于挑选出来营救吉米的那帮人中的一员，因此无需质疑。阿奇平时不爱说话，可他经常带着主人的姿态，和吉米静静聊上个把小时。白天无论什么时候，甚至夜里也经常见到有人坐在吉米的箱子上。傍晚，六点到八点之间，小屋里挤得水泄不通，门口还围着一群兴趣盎然的人。个个都盯着那黑人。</td>
		<td class="en">It was at that time that Belfast’s devotion—and also his pugnacity—secured universal respect.He spent every moment of his spare time in Jimmy’s cabin.He tended him, talked to him; was as gentle as a woman, as tenderly gay as an old philanthropist, as sentimentally careful of his nigger as a model slave-owner.But outside he was irritable, explosive as gunpowder, sombre, suspicious, and never more brutal than when most sorrowful.With him it was a tear and a blow: a tear for Jimmy, a blow for any one who did not seem to take a scrupulously orthodox view of Jimmy’s case.We talked about nothing else.The two Scandinavians, even, discussed the situation—but it was impossible to know in what spirit, because they quarrelled in their own language.Belfast suspected one of them of irreverence, and in this incertitude thought that there was no option but to fight them both.They became very much terrified by his truculence, and henceforth lived amongst us, dejected, like a pair of mutes.Wamibo never spoke intelligibly, but he was as smileless as an animal—seemed to know much less about it all than the cat—and consequently was safe.Moreover, he had belonged to the chosen band of Jimmy’s rescuers, and was above suspicion.Archie was silent generally, but often spent an hour or so talking to Jimmy quietly with an air of proprietorship.At any time of the day and often through the night some man could be seen sitting on Jimmy’s box.In the evening, between six and eight, the cabin was crowded, and there was an interested group at the door.Every one stared at the nigger.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛格尔顿超然如常，似乎对行将逝去生命的琐碎小事不屑一顾。只有一回，他走上前来，却又出人意料地在门口停下了。他默默地凝视着吉米，似乎要把这黑鬼加入到盘踞在他久远记忆中的那群幽灵中去。我们安静异常，辛格尔顿站了好一阵子，仿佛带有使命，专程来召唤某人或者查看某一重大事件似的。詹姆斯·韦特一动不动地躺着，显然没有觉察到别人在仔细端详他，这端详充满了期待。此时，空气中弥漫着一场争斗。我们感到了观看争斗的人们内心的紧张。末了，吉米带着明显的恐惧，在枕头上转动着头。“晚上好。”他用温顺的声音问候道。“嗯。”老海员粗鲁地答道。他威严地定睛打量了吉米一阵，突然走开了。过了好久，船舱内才有人开口讲话，此时我们大家呼吸似乎更加自由，像刚从危险中逃出的人们一样。我们都清楚这位老人对吉米的看法，可谁也不敢反驳。这些看法令人不安，它们会带来痛苦；更糟的是，据我们了解，这些看法都是正确的。只有一次，他屈尊向我们充分解释了他这些看法，于是给大家留下了永久的印象。他说吉米是导致逆风的根源。绝症病人——他说——会捱到看见陆地，一见陆地，就会死去；吉米也明白，第一片陆地将会夺去他的生命。哪条船都是如此。难道我们不知道？他用鄙视的语气严厉地问我们：我们知道些什么？我们下一步还会怀疑什么？吉米的愿望赢得了我们的支持，得到了沃米博的（他是个芬兰人——不是吗？很好！）咒语的帮助，使得这条船在大海上踯躅不前。</td>
		<td class="en">Singleton as usual held aloof, appearing to scorn the insignificant events of an ended life.Once only he came along, and unexpectedly stopped in the doorway.He peered at Jimmy in profound silence, as if desirous to add that black image to the crowd of Shades that peopled his old memory.We kept very quiet, and for a long time Singleton stood there as though he had come by appointment to call for some one, or to see some important event.James Wait lay perfectly still, and apparently not aware of the gaze scrutinising him with a steadiness full of expectation.There was a sense of a contest in the air.We felt the inward strain of men watching a wrestling bout.At last Jimmy with perceptible apprehension turned his head on the pillow.—“Good evening,” he said in a conciliating tone.—“H’m,” answered the old seaman, grumpily.For a moment longer he looked at Jimmy with severe fixity, then suddenly went away.It was a long time before any one spoke in the little cabin, though we all breathed more freely as men do after an escape from some dangerous situation.We all knew the old man’s ideas about Jimmy, and nobody dared to combat them.They were unsettling, they caused pain; and, what was worse, they might have been true for all we knew.Only once did he condescend to explain them fully, but the impression was lasting.He said that Jimmy was the cause of head winds.Mortally sick men—he maintained—linger till the first sight of land, and then die; and Jimmy knew that the very first land would draw his life from him.It is so in every ship.Didn’t we know it?He asked us with austere contempt: what did we know?What would we doubt next?Jimmy’s desire encouraged by us and aided by Wamibo’s (he was a Finn—wasn’t he?Very well!) by Wamibo’s spells delayed the ship in the open sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种情况只有傻瓜才看不出来。有谁听说过海上要么持续风平浪静要么总刮逆风？这不符合自然规律……我们无可否认这有点离奇。我们深感不安。俗话所谓“天数越多，挣钱越多”并不能像平常一样给我们一丝安慰，因为我们储备的粮食越来越少。在过好望角时，不少粮食损毁了，我们的饼干供应量也减少了一半。豌豆、糖和茶早就用光了。腌肉也快没有了。我们虽然有足够的咖啡，可煮咖啡的淡水却剩的很少。我们勒紧腰带，从早到晚不停地给船洗刷、打磨和上漆。不久她就看起来焕然一新；可饥饿却缠住了她。不是完全的饿死，而是一步步逼近你的活生生的饥饿，它悄悄地在甲板上溜达，睡在水手舱中；醒着的时候折磨你，睡梦中折腾你。我们望望上风头，看有无改变风向的迹象。不管白天黑夜，每隔几小时，我们就给她调次头，希望她最终能够顺风前进！可她却不。她似乎忘记了回家的路；左冲右突，一会儿头朝西北，一会儿头朝东方；她前后奔波，心烦意乱，活像一只墙根下胆怯的动物撞来撞去。有时，她仿佛累得要死，于是便会一整天都在宁静大海的平滑微波里少气无力地打转。摇摆的桅杆上挂着的帆篷在平静海面上闷热的空气中使劲地拍打着。我们疲惫不堪，又饥又渴，开始相信辛格尔顿所说的话，可我们对吉米忠诚不二，所以在他面前只得把自己的想法隐藏起来。我们用诙谐的隐喻和他说话，我们仿佛是巧妙计策中快乐的同谋；可我们不忘用渴求的眼光，越过船栏向西眺望，希望看到一种迹象，一种顺风的迹象；即使这第一丝风给不情愿的吉米带来死讯。可这是徒劳！宇宙与詹姆斯·韦特早已串通好了。轻快的微风再次从北边吹来；天空依然晴空万里；此时我们倍感困乏，可闪光的大海在微风吹拂下，却纵情地享受着明媚的阳光，似乎忘记了我们的生命与困苦。</td>
		<td class="en">Only lubberly fools couldn’t see it.Whoever heard of such a run of calms and head winds?It wasn’t natural....We could not deny that it was strange.We felt uneasy.The common saying, “More days, more dollars,” did not give the usual comfort because the stores were running short.Much had been spoiled off the Cape, and we were on half allowance of biscuit.Peas, sugar and tea had been finished long ago.Salt meat was giving out.We had plenty of coffee but very little water to make it with.We took up another hole in our belts and went on scraping, polishing, painting the ship from morning to night.And soon she looked as though she had come out of a band-box; but hunger lived on board of her.Not dead starvation, but steady, living hunger that stalked about the decks, slept in the forecastle; the tormentor of waking moments, the disturber of dreams.We looked to windward for signs of change.Every few hours of night and day we put her round with the hope that she would come up on that tack at last!She didn’t.She seemed to have forgotten the way home; she rushed to and fro, heading northwest, heading east; she ran backwards and forwards, distracted, like a timid creature at the foot of a wall.Sometimes, as if tired to death, she would wallow languidly for a day in the smooth swell of an unruffled sea.All up the swinging masts the sails thrashed furiously through the hot stillness of the calm.We were weary, hungry, thirsty; we commenced to believe Singleton, but with unshaken fidelity dissembled to Jimmy.We spoke to him with jocose allusiveness, like cheerful accomplices in a clever plot; but we looked to the westward over the rail with longing eyes for a sign of hope, for a sign of fair wind; even if its first breath should bring death to our reluctant Jimmy.In vain!The universe conspired with James Wait.Light airs from the northward sprang up again; the sky remained clear; and round our weariness the glittering sea, touched by the breeze, basked voluptuously in the great sunshine, as though it had forgotten our life and trouble.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Donkin looked out for a fair wind along with the rest.No one knew the venom of his thoughts now.He was silent, and appeared thinner, as if consumed slowly by an inward rage at the injustice of men and of fate.He was ignored by all and spoke to no one, but his hate for every man dwelt in his furtive eyes.He talked with the cook only, having somehow persuaded the good man that he—Donkin—was a much calumniated and persecuted person.Together they bewailed the immorality of the ship’s company.There could be no greater criminals than we, who by our lies conspired to send the unprepared soul of a poor ignorant black man to everlasting perdition.Podmore cooked what there was to cook, remorsefully, and felt all the time that by preparing the food of such sinners he imperilled his own salvation.As to the Captain—he had sailed with him for seven years, now, he said, and would not have believed it possible that such a man...“Well. Well...There it was...Can’t get out of it.Judgment capsized all in a minute...Struck in all his pride...More like a sudden visitation than anything else.” Donkin, perched sullenly on the coal-locker, swung his legs and concurred.He paid in the coin of spurious assent for the privilege to sit in the galley; he was disheartened and scandalised; he agreed with the cook; could find no words severe enough to criticise our conduct; and when in the heat of reprobation he swore at us, Podmore, who would have liked to swear also if it hadn’t been for his principles, pretended not to hear.So Donkin, unrebuked, cursed enough for two, cadged for matches, borrowed tobacco, and loafed for hours, very much at home, before the stove.From there he could hear us on the other side of the bulkhead, talking to Jimmy.The cook knocked the saucepans about, slammed the oven door, muttered prophesies of damnation for all the ship’s company; and Donkin, who did not admit of any hereafter (except for purposes of blasphemy) listened, concentrated and angry, gloating fiercely over a called-up image of infinite torment—as men gloat over the accursed images of cruelty and revenge, of greed, and of power....</td></tr>

Footsteps echoed on her quiet decks.The moonlight clung to her like a frosted mist, and the white sails stood out in dazzling cones as of stainless snow.In the magnificence of the phantom rays the ship appeared pure like a vision of ideal beauty, illusive like a tender dream of serene peace.And nothing in her was real, nothing was distinct and solid but the heavy shadows that filled her decks with their unceasing and noiseless stir: the shadows darker than the night and more restless than the thoughts of men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >唐金心怀怨恨，独自一人蹑手蹑脚穿行在阴影中，心里思忖着吉米拖了这么久还没有死去。那天晚上，高处的人们报告说看到了陆地，船长一边调试望远镜的长筒，一边凄楚地和贝克先生聊天，经过一步步艰难的航行，我们终于到了西部群岛，现在别无他求，只要近期风平浪静就行。天气晴朗，气压表升得很高。轻柔的微风随着太阳的西沉变得更加微弱，无边无际的沉静笼罩着晒热的海水，预示着夜里不会有风。只要白昼没有消逝，水手们便聚在船头楼最前部观看东方的天空，那里，弗洛里斯群岛屹立在无边无际的海面上，轮廓曲折断续，仿佛辽阔荒凉的平原上一座死气沉沉的废墟。这是四个月以来见到的首块陆地。查利十分兴奋，在大家的怂恿下，竟然对上司放肆起来。大家莫名其妙地兴高采烈，三五成群地交谈着，不时挥舞着光光的臂膀。在这毋庸置疑的现实面前，吉米亦真亦幻的存在似乎暂时被人们遗忘，这还是此次航行的头一回。我们总算走过了漫长的路程。贝尔法斯特高谈阔论，引用凭空想象的事例，说明从这片群岛回家的路有多么便捷。“那些运水果的快速帆船只需五天，”他肯定地说道，“你需要什么？——仅仅是一点风。” 阿奇却坚持说，航海记录上说要走七天，于是他们用侮辱的话语亲切地争论着。诺尔斯嚷嚷道，他从那儿已经闻得见家乡的气息啦，他把重量倚在那只短腿上，放声大笑，几乎笑折了腰。一群头发灰白的老水手默默注视了片刻，脸上露出严峻凝重的表情。有位突然说道：“现在离伦敦不太远了。”“上岸的头一晚上，我非得好好吃上一顿牛排加洋葱……再喝上一品脱苦啤酒。”另一位说。“你是说一桶。”有人喊道。“一日三餐，光吃火腿和鸡蛋。我就这样过！”一个激动的声音嚷嚷道。接下来是一阵叽叽喳喳，这是赞同的低语声；人们的眼睛开始闪亮；嘴嚼得咂咂作响；急促开怀的笑声不时传来。阿奇克制住自己暗自微笑。辛格尔顿走了过来，漠不关心地瞥了一眼，一言未发，便走了下去，他那漠然的样子，仿佛见过弗洛里斯无数次了。东方赶来的夜从清澈的空中降下，遮住了布满紫色斑点的高地。“没有一丝风浪。”有人静静地说。兴致勃勃的低声交谈突然松懈下来，逐渐消失；聚集的人群四散开来，人们一个个飘然离去，他们慢慢走下梯子，神情严肃，仿佛有关他们冥冥中的主宰的那句话惊醒了他们。硕大橙黄的月亮从清澈的地平线薄薄的边缘升了起来，它发现轮船正沉醉在屏息般的沉默中；一艘无畏的似乎酣睡着的无梦之船，正躺在沉睡着的可怕的大海怀中。</td>
		<td class="en">Donkin prowled spiteful and alone amongst the shadows, thinking that Jimmy too long delayed to die. That evening land had been reported from aloft, and the master, while adjusting the tubes of the long glass, had observed with quiet bitterness to Mr. Baker that, after fighting our way inch by inch to the Western Islands, there was nothing to expect now but a spell of calm.The sky was clear and the barometer high.The light breeze dropped with the sun, and an enormous stillness, forerunner of a night without wind, descended upon the heated waters of the ocean.As long as daylight lasted, the hands collected on the forecastle-head watched on the eastern sky the island of Flores, that rose above the level expanse of the sea with irregular and broken outlines like a sombre ruin upon a vast and deserted plain.It was the first land seen for nearly four months.Charley was excited, and in the midst of general indulgence took liberties with his betters.Men strangely elated without knowing why, talked in groups, and pointed with bared arms.For the first time that voyage Jimmy’s sham existence seemed for a moment forgotten in the face of a solid reality.We had got so far anyhow.Belfast discoursed, quoting imaginary examples of short homeward runs from the Islands.“Them smart fruit schooners do it in five days,” he affirmed.“What do you want?—only a good little breeze.” Archie maintained that seven days was the record passage, and they disputed amicably with insulting words.Knowles declared he could already smell home from there, and with a heavy list on his short leg laughed fit to split his sides.A group of grizzled sea-dogs looked out for a time in silence and with grim absorbed faces.One said suddenly—“’Tain’t far to London now.”—“My first night ashore, blamme if I haven’t steak and onions for supper...and a pint of bitter,” said another.—“A barrel ye mean,” shouted someone.—“Ham an’ eggs three times a day. That’s the way I live!” cried an excited voice.There was a stir, appreciative murmurs; eyes began to shine; jaws champed; short, nervous laughs were heard.Archie smiled with reserve all to himself.Singleton came up, gave a careless glance, and went down again without saying a word, indifferent, like a man who had seen Flores an incalculable number of times.The night travelling from the East blotted out of the limpid sky the purple stain of the high land.“Dead calm,” said somebody quietly.The murmur of lively talk suddenly wavered, died out; the clusters broke up; men began to drift away one by one, descending the ladders slowly and with serious faces as if sobered by that reminder of their dependence upon the invisible.And when the big yellow moon ascended gently above the sharp rim of the clear horizon it found the ship wrapped up in a breathless silence; a fearless ship that seemed to sleep profoundly, dreamlessly on the bosom of the sleeping and terrible sea.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Donkin chafed at the peace—at the ship—at the sea that stretching away on all sides merged into the illimitable silence of all creation.He felt himself pulled up sharp by unrecognised grievances.He had been physically cowed, but his injured dignity remained indomitable, and nothing could heal his lacerated feelings.Here was land already—home very soon—a bad pay-day—no clothes—more hard work.How offensive all this was.Land. The land that draws away life from sick sailors.That nigger there had money—clothes—easy times; and would not die. Land draws life away....He felt tempted to go and see whether it did.Perhaps already.. It would be a bit of luck.There was money in the beggar’s chest.He stepped briskly out of the shadows into the moonlight, and, instantly, his craving, hungry face from sallow became livid.He opened the door of the cabin and had a shock.Sure enough, Jimmy was dead!He moved no more than a recumbent figure with clasped hands, carved on the lid of a stone coffin.Donkin glared with avidity.Then Jimmy, without stirring, blinked his eyelids, and Donkin had another shock.Those eyes were rather startling.He shut the door behind his back with gentle care, looking intently the while at James Wait as though he had come in there at a great risk to tell some secret of startling im-portance.Jimmy did not move but glanced languidly out of the corners of his eyes.—“Calm?” he asked.—“Yuss,” said Donkin, very disappointed, and sat down on the box.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种访问不管白天黑夜，什么时候都有，吉米已经习以为常。这个去那个来。他们讲话声音清晰，用词欢快，重复着老笑话，倾听着他讲话；每人离开时，似乎都留下了一丝生气，献出了些许力量，反复交代要保重生命——生命不可毁灭！他不喜欢独自呆在自己的舱房里，因为，独自一人时，觉得自己根本不存在。一切都没有。没有痛苦。至少现在没有。一点不错——可他享受不了健康带给他的安静，除非有人在旁边看着。这家伙会跟任何人做得一样好。唐金悄悄地观察着他。“马上就到家了。”韦特说。“你干嘛说话声这么小？”唐金饶有兴趣地问道，“怎么不大声讲？”吉米显得有些生气，好一阵子没言语；然后，用低低的声音闷闷地说道：“我干嘛要叫嚷？你又不是聋子，这我还不知道。”“噢！我听得再清楚不过了。”唐金低低的声音答道，眼睛朝下看。他正悲伤得想着出去时，吉米又开腔了：“我们真正到家时，弄点什么像样的东西吃……我老觉得饿。”唐金突然怒气冲天。“我呢，”他声音沙哑地叫道，“我也饿得难受，可还得去干活。而你，还说饿！”“你干的活又不会要你的命，”韦特有气无力地说，“这儿下铺有几块饼干——你拿一块吃吧。我吃不下去。”　唐金猛冲过去，在角落里乱摸起来，当他走回来时，嘴里已经塞得满满的。他充满热情地咀嚼着。吉米似乎睁着眼睛打瞌睡。唐金吃罢硬饼干站起身。“你还不走？”吉米问道，眼睛死死盯着天花板。“不走。”唐金脱口答道，于是不但没有走，反而将背靠在了关着的门上。他打量着詹姆斯·韦特，只见他又高又瘦，形容枯槁，好像在白色炉子的烘烤下，肌肉都皱缩在了骨头上；一只手枯瘦的五指在床铺边沿轻轻来回移动，弹奏着没完没了的曲子。打量他真是让人既恼火又厌倦，他这样子可能还会捱上几天。他真吓人——完全处在不死不活的境地，正是对生死的无知，他才不会受到任何伤害。唐金饶有兴趣地去开导他。“你心里在想些什么呢？”他直率地问道。詹姆斯·韦特那瘦骨嶙峋、死人般冷漠的脸上浮现出一丝怪异的笑容，这笑容令人惊恐，仿佛梦中死人的突然微笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Jimmy was used to such visits at all times of night of day. Men succeeded one another.They spoke in clear voices, pronounced cheerful words, repeated old jokes, listened to him; and each, going out, seemed to leave behind a little of his own vitality, surrender some of his own strength, renew the assurance of life—the indestructible thing!He did not like to be alone in his cabin, because, when he was alone, it seemed to him as if he hadn’t been there at all.There was nothing.No pain.Not now. Perfectly right—but he couldn’t enjoy his healthful repose unless some one was by to see it.This man would do as well as anybody.Donkin watched him stealthily:—“Soon home now,” observed Wait.—“Vy d’yer whisper?” asked Donkin with interest, “can’t yer speak up?” Jimmy looked annoyed and said nothing for a while; then in a lifeless, unringing voice:—“Why should I shout?You ain’t deaf that I know.”—“Oh!I can ’ear right enough,” answered Donkin in a low tone, and looked down.He was thinking sadly of going out when Jimmy spoke again.—“Time we did get home...to get something decent to eat...I am always hungry.” Donkin felt angry all of a sudden.—“What about me,” he hissed, “I am ’ungry too an’ got ter work.You, ’ungry!”—“Your work won’t kill you,” commented Wait, feebly; “there’s a couple of biscuits in the lower bunk there—you may have one.I can’t eat them.” Donkin dived in, groped in the corner and when he came up again his mouth was full.He munched with ardour.Jimmy seemed to doze with open eyes.Donkin finished his hard bread and got up.—“You’re not going?” asked Jimmy, staring at the ceiling.—“No,” said Donkin, impulsively, and instead of going out leaned his back against the closed door.He looked at James Wait, and saw him long, lean, dried up, as though all his flesh had shrivelled on his bones in the heat of a white furnace; the meagre fingers of one hand moved lightly upon the edge of the bunk playing an endless tune.To look at him was irritating and fatiguing; he could last like this for days; he was outrageous—belonging wholly neither to death nor life, and perfectly invulnerable in his apparent ignorance of both.Donkin felt tempted to enlighten him.—“What are yer thinkin’ of?” he asked, surlily.James Wait had a grimacing smile that passed over the deathlike impassiveness of his bony face, incredible and frightful as would, in a dream, have been the sudden smile of a corpse.</td></tr>

Donkin felt this vaguely like a blind man feeling in his darkness the fatal antagonism of all the surrounding existences, that to him shall for ever remain irrealisable, unseen and enviable.He had a desire to assert his importance, to break, to crush; to be even with everybody for everything; to tear the veil, unmask, expose, leave no refuge—a perfidious desire of truthfulness!He laughed in a mocking splutter and said:</td></tr>

Steady.”Belfast obeyed, pulled, lifted, overcome with sorrow, dropping tears on the tarred twine.—.“Don’t you drag the canvas too taut over his poor face, Sails,” he entreated, tearfully.—“What are you fashing yourself for?He will be comfortable enough,” assured the sailmaker, cutting the thread after the last stitch, which came about the middle of Jimmy’s forehead.He rolled up the remaining canvas, put away the needles.“What makes you take on so?” he asked.Belfast looked down at the long package of grey sailcloth.—“I pulled him out,” he whispered, “and he did not want to go. If I had sat up with him last night he would have kept alive for me...but something made me tired.” The sailmaker took vigorous draws at his pipe and mumbled:—“When I...West India Station...In the —Blanche— frigate...Yellow Jack...sewed in twenty men a week...Portsmouth-Devon-port men—townies—knew their fathers, mothers, sisters—the whole boiling of ’em.Thought nothing of it.And these niggers like this one—you don’t know where it comes from.Got nobody.No use to nobody.Who will miss him?”—“I do—I pulled him out,” mourned Belfast dismally.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了外面，登上塔山，他们的眼睛不住地眨，脚步也变得迟缓拖沓，仿佛被这陌生的雾光刺花了眼，又像被这人山人海的景象扰乱了心；这些能在吼叫的狂风中听清彼此说话的人们，当面对这纷繁尘世的喧嚣时似乎耳朵聋了，思想乱了。“到黑马饭店去！到黑马饭店去！”有人嚷嚷道，“大家分手前好好喝上一杯。”他们穿过马路，一个跟着一个。只有贝尔法斯特和查利各自走开了。当我走近时，看见一个面色黑红的女人正搂着查利的脖子，只见她系着一条灰色围巾，蓬乱的头发上满是灰尘。那是他母亲。她亲昵地说道：“啊，我的孩子！我的孩子！”“放开我，”查利说，“放开我，妈妈！”　当时我从他身旁经过，他越过那老泪纵横的老太太的脏头，对我滑稽地笑了笑，然后瞥了我一眼，这深沉的目光充满了讥讽和鼓励，使我关于人生的全部认识变得不值一提。我冲他点点头走了过去，可又听到他愉快地说：“要是你这会儿放开我——我会从工钱中拿出一先令给你买酒喝。”又走了几步，我碰见了贝尔法斯特。他热情地拉住我的胳膊，身子有点哆嗦。“我可不能跟他们一块儿去。”他吞吞吐吐地说，点头暗示正热热闹闹漫步在街对面人行道上的那帮人。“我一想起吉米……可怜的吉姆！我一想起他，就再也没有心思喝酒了。你也是他的好朋友……是我把他拖出来的……是吧？他的头发那样短…… 确实。是我偷了那该死的饼……他不愿走……谁拖他都不愿走。”他说着泪流满面。“我从没有惹过他——从没有——从没有！”他呜咽着说，“他倒要揍我像……像……只绵羊。”</td>
		<td class="en">Outside, on Tower Hill, they blinked, hesitated clumsily, as if blinded by the strange quality of the hazy light, as if discomposed by the view of so many men; and they who could hear one another in the howl of gales seemed deafened and distracted by the dull roar of the busy earth.—“To the Black Horse!To the Black Horse!” cried some.“Let us have a drink together before we part.” They crossed the road, clinging to one another.Only Charley and Belfast wandered off alone.As I came up I saw a red-faced, blowsy woman, in a grey shawl, and with dusty, fluffy hair, fall on Charley’s neck.It was his mother.She slobbered over him:—“O, my boy!My boy!”—“Leggo of me,” said Charley, “Leggo, mother!” I was passing him at the time, and over the untidy head of the blubbering woman he gave me a humorous smile and a glance ironic, courageous, and profound, that seemed to put all my knowledge of life to shame.I nodded and passed on, but heard him say again, good-naturedly:—“If you leggo of me this minyt—ye shall ’ave a bob for a drink out of my pay.” In the next few steps I came upon Belfast.He caught my arm with tremulous enthusiasm.—“I couldn’t go wi’ ’em,” he stammered, indicating by a nod our noisy crowd, that drifted slowly along the other sidewalk.“When I think of Jimmy...Poor Jim!When I think of him I have no heart for drink.You were his chum, too...but I pulled him out...didn’t I?Short wool he had....Yes. And I stole the blooming pie....He wouldn’t go....He wouldn’t go for nobody.” He burst into tears.“I never touched him—never—never!” he sobbed.“He went for me like...like...a lamb.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我巧妙地脱了身。贝尔法斯特每次哭闹发作，结果总是同别人打上一架，他宣泄难以排解的痛苦时，我可不愿当靶子。再说，我们旁边还站着两名身材高大的警察，正用怀疑的目光盯着我们，眼睛里流露着对职责的无限忠诚。“再见啦！”我说罢便径自走开了。</td>
		<td class="en">I disengaged myself gently.Belfast’s crying fits generally ended in a fight with some one, and I wasn’t anxious to stand the brunt of his inconsolable sorrow.Moreover, two bulky policemen stood near by, looking at us with a disapproving and incorruptible gaze.—“So long!” I said, and went on my way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在街道拐弯处，我收住脚步，向“水仙号”的水手们投去了最后一眼。他们正摇摇摆摆慢慢吞吞地走在铸币厂外面宽阔的石板路上，一路上有说有笑，热热闹闹。他们正向黑马饭店走去；那里的店员长着凶神恶煞的面孔，戴着皮帽子，不穿外套，只穿衬衣。他们从漆过的桶里取出力量、欢乐和幸福的幻影；人生的辉煌与诗歌的幻影，分给这些南行船上发过工钱的水手们。远远地，我看见他们高谈阔论，打着笨拙的手势，目光中闪烁着欢乐的光芒，而生命之海却在他们耳畔不住震响，可没人留意。他们在白色石路上晃荡，周围是匆忙喧嚣的人群，他们似乎变成了另类——迷茫、孤独、健忘、在劫难逃；他们像流浪汉，像不顾后果，只图欢乐的流浪汉，像疯狂的流浪汉，在暴风雨中还坐在危险的礁石上寻欢作乐。城市的喧嚣犹如高耸海浪的轰鸣，无情、强劲，声音洪大，目的残忍；头顶上的云散开了；普照的阳光顺着污秽房屋的墙壁泻了下来。一群黑压压的海员便徜徉在阳光里。他们的左侧，塔园里的树木在叹息，塔石熠熠发光，似乎在光的嬉戏中动了起来，仿佛突然记起了过去一切巨大的欢乐与痛苦，这正是这些人斗争的原型；抓壮丁队；暴动的叫声；妇女河边的哭声；人们庆祝胜利的欢呼声。天上的阳光仿佛是上帝赐予的礼物，照在地上的烂泥中，照在深藏记忆而又沉默不语的石头上，照在贪婪自私上，照在健忘之人焦急的脸上。黑压压的人群右侧，铸币厂漆过的正面被阳光洗得干干净净，顷刻变得雪白耀眼，仿佛成了童话故事中的大理石宫殿。“水仙号”上的水手们逐渐漂出了视线。</td>
		<td class="en">But at the corner I stopped to take my last look at the crew of the—Narcissus—.They were swaying irresolute and noisy on the broad flagstones before the Mint.They were bound for the Black Horse, where men, in fur caps with brutal faces and in shirt sleeves, dispense out of varnished barrels the illusions of strength, mirth, happiness; the illusion of splendour and poetry of life, to the paid-off crews of southern-going ships.From afar I saw them discoursing, with jovial eyes and clumsy gestures, while the sea of life thundered into their ears ceaseless and unheeded.And swaying about there on the white stones, surrounded by the hurry and clamour of men, they appeared to be creatures of another kind—lost, alone, forgetful, and doomed; they were like castaways, like reckless and joyous castaways, like mad castaways making merry in the storm and upon an insecure ledge of a treacherous rock.The roar of the town resembled the roar of topping breakers, merciless and strong, with a loud voice and cruel purpose; but overhead the clouds broke; a flood of sunshine streamed down the walls of grimy houses.The dark knot of seamen drifted in sunshine.To the left of them the trees in Tower Gardens sighed, the stones of the Tower gleaming, seemed to stir in the play of light, as if remembering suddenly all the great joys and sorrows of the past, the fighting prototypes of these men; press-gangs; mutinous cries; the wailing of women by the riverside, and the shouts of men welcoming victories.The sunshine of heaven fell like a gift of grace on the mud of the earth, on the remembering and mute stones, on greed, selfishness; on the anxious faces of forgetful men.And to the right of the dark group the stained front of the Mint, cleansed by the flood of light, stood out for a moment dazzling and white like a marble palace in a fairy tale.The crew of the—Narcissus—drifted out of sight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >自此以后，我再也没有见过他们。大海带走了一些，轮船接收了几个，陆地上的坟场会说明其余人的去向。毫无疑问，辛格尔顿会把他忠实工作的漫长记录，带入那热情大海的平静深渊中去。至于唐金，他一辈子也没干过一天体面活，不用说，他要谋生，只得靠他那污言秽语的雄辩，去为劳工争取生存权利。这样也好！陆地和大海各得其所。</td>
		<td class="en">I never saw them again.The sea took some, the steamers took others, the graveyards of the earth will account for the rest.Singleton has no doubt taken with him the long record of his faithful work into the peaceful depths of an hospitable sea.And Donkin, who never did a decent day’s work in his life, no doubt earns his living by discoursing with filthy eloquence upon the right of labour to live.So be it!Let the earth and the sea each have its own.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个离去的船友，和其他任何人一样，永远离去了；我从未再见过他们其中任何一个。然而有时，记忆的春汛会猛力涌入黑暗的九曲河。于是，孤独的河上便会漂浮着一条船——一条阴影似的船，由一班幽灵似的水手驾驶着。他们朦朦胧胧地打了个招呼就一闪而过。难道我们不是一起在永恒的大海上，从我们罪孽的生命中挤出了一点意义吗？再见了，兄弟们！你们是一帮好人。不比任何一帮水手逊色：你们曾经狂吼着去操纵那不住拍打着的沉重的前桅帆；或者在漆黑的夜色中，攀在高空摇荡着，对着狂怒的西风高声呐喊。</td>
		<td class="en">A gone shipmate, like any other man, is gone for ever; and I never met one of them again.But at times the spring-flood of memory sets with force up the dark River of the Nine Bends.Then on the waters of the forlorn stream drifts a ship—a shadowy ship manned by a crew of Shades.They pass and make a sign, in a shadowy hail.Haven’t we, together and upon the immortal sea, wrung out a meaning from our sinful lives?Good-bye, brothers!You were a good crowd.As good a crowd as ever fisted with wild cries the beating canvas of a heavy foresail; or tossing aloft, invisible in the night, gave back yell for yell to a westerly gale.</td></tr>
