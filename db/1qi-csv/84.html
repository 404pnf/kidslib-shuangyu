		<td class="en">First Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours.You would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years.Then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist.Mrs. Parker’s manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents, who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted Mrs. Parker’s parlours.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着，你爬上一层楼梯去看租金八美元的二楼后间。帕克太太摆出了她到二楼后惯有的神情，让你确信这里值十二美元。她说图森贝里先生一直付这个价，直到他离开这儿去接管他哥哥在佛罗里达州棕榈滩附近的橘子园，还说麦金太尔太太总去那儿过冬，那儿有带独立浴室的两厅前间。你好不容易才含含糊糊地说你想要间更便宜的。</td>
		<td class="en">Next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second-floor-back at $8.Convinced by her second-floor manner that it was worth the $12 that Mr. Toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother’s orange plantation in Florida near Palm Beach, where Mrs. McIntyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath, you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果你经受得住帕克太太鄙视的嘲笑，你就会被带到三楼参观斯基德先生的大房间。斯基德先生的房间并不空着。他一天到晚都呆在房里写剧本，抽香烟。但是，每个来看房间的人都会被带到他的房间去欣赏窗户上的挂帘。每次参观之后，斯基德先生都会交点租金，生怕自己有可能被赶出去。</td>
		<td class="en">If you survived Mrs. Parker’s scorn, you were taken to look at Mr. Skidder’s large hall room on the third floor.Mr. Skidder’s room was not vacant.He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long.But every room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins.After each visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused by possible eviction, would pay something on his rent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后——哦，然后——如果你还是忐忑地站着，发烫的手在口袋里攥着三张汗湿了的美元，声音嘶哑地诉说自己那可恶的贫困，简直羞愧极了。帕克太太可就再也不会是你的向导了。她会大喊一声“克拉拉”，然后转身，迈着大步下楼去了。接着，黑人女仆克拉拉会陪你爬上铺着毡毯的四层楼梯，让你看带天窗的房间。它位于房子正中，宽七英尺，长八英尺。它的两边是黑洞洞的杂物间或储藏室。</td>
		<td class="en">Then—oh, then—if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty, nevermore would Mrs. Parker be cicerone of yours.She would honk loudly the word “Clara,” she would show you her back, and march downstairs.Then Clara, the coloured maid, would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight, and show you the Skylight Room.It occupied 7×8 feet of floor space at the middle of the hall.On each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >屋里面有一张简易铁床，一个脸盆架和一把椅子。一个架子充当梳妆台。四面光秃秃的墙像棺材的四壁一样，朝着你直逼过来。你的手慢慢摸向喉咙，你大口喘着气，你像呆在井底似的朝上望去——总算又能喘过气了。透过小天窗的玻璃，你可以看到一块一望无际的蓝色天幕。</td>
		<td class="en">In it was an iron cot, a washstand and a chair.A shelf was the dresser.Its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin.Your hand crept to your throat, you gasped, you looked up as from a well—and breathed once more.Through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“两美元，先生。”克拉拉用半是轻视半是塔斯基吉式的口气说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Two dollars, suh,” Clara would say in her half-contemptuous, half-Tuskegeenial tones.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，利森小姐来看房。她带着一台大个头女人才能拖得动的打字机。她身材娇小，她的个头不再长高之后，她的眼睛和头发依然一个劲儿地长，它们看起来似乎总在说：“天哪！你为什么不跟我们一块长呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">One day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room.She carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady.She was a very little girl, with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying: “Goodness me!Why didn’t you keep up with us?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >帕克太太带她去看了那间复式起居室。“这个壁橱里，”她说，“可以放一副骨架，或者麻醉剂，或者煤块——”</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Parker showed her the double parlours.“In this closet,” she said, “one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但我既不是大夫，也不是牙医。”利森小姐说，同时忍不住哆嗦了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">“But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist,” said Miss Leeson, with a shiver.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >帕克太太用怀疑、怜悯、嘲笑和冰冷的目光瞪了她一眼，这是她对付不够大夫或牙医资格的人的惯用招数，然后带路去二楼后间。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists, and led the way to the second floor back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“八美元？”利森小姐说，“天哪！就算我看着年轻，我可不是海蒂（那样的富家小姐）。我只是一个贫穷的小女工。带我看看楼层高一些、便宜一些的房间吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Eight dollars?” said Miss Leeson.“Dear me!I’m not Hetty if I do look green.I’m just a poor little working girl.Show me something higher and lower.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到敲门声，斯基德先生跳了起来，烟头撒了一地。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“打扰了，斯基德先生，”，望着他苍白的面色，帕克太太不怀好意地笑着说，“我不知道你在家。我是请这位小姐来参观一下你的挂帘。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Excuse me, Mr. Skidder,” said Mrs. Parker, with her demon’s smile at his pale looks.“I didn’t know you were in.I asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它们比什么都可爱。”利森小姐说，露出天使般的笑容。</td>
		<td class="en">“They’re too lovely for anything,” said Miss Leeson, smiling in exactly the way the angels do.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们离开后斯基德先生就忙活了起来，他删去了还未上映的新剧本中高个子黑头发的女主角，换上了一位头发浓密亮泽、身材娇小、活泼俏皮的姑娘。</td>
		<td class="en">After they had gone Mr. Skidder got very busy erasing the tall, black-haired heroine from his latest (unproduced) play and inserting a small, roguish one with heavy, bright hair and vivacious features.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“安娜·赫尔德也会争着演这个角色的。”斯基德先生自言自语道，他抬起脚搁在窗子的挂帘上，像墨鱼一样消失在一片缭绕的烟雾中。</td>
		<td class="en">“Anna Held’ll jump at it,” said Mr. Skidder to himself, putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没过一会儿，响起了警铃一样的喊声“克拉拉！”，向全世界宣告利森小姐的经济情况。一个黑皮肤的小鬼抓住她，带她爬上阴森森的楼梯，把她推进一间只有屋顶透着一丝光亮的拱顶房间，然后嘟囔出几个险恶而又神秘的字眼：“两美元！”</td>
		<td class="en">Presently the tocsin call of “Clara!” sounded to the world the state of Miss Leeson’s purse.A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian stairway, thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words “Two dollars!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我租下了！”利森小姐叹了口气，在吱吱作响的铁床上沉重地坐了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll take it!” sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >利森小姐每天都出去工作。晚上，她会带回家一些手写的稿子，用打字机打出来。有时晚上不需要工作，她就会和别的房客一起坐在门廊前高高的台阶上。上帝创造利森小姐时，并没有打算让她住进带天窗的房间。她生性乐观开朗，满脑子温柔善感、微妙古怪的想法。有一次，她让斯基德先生给她读了他那部（尚未出版的）喜剧巨作《并非玩笑》（又名《地铁的继承人》）中的三幕。</td>
		<td class="en">Every day Miss Leeson went out to work.At night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter.Sometimes she had no work at night, and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers.Miss Leeson was not intended for a sky-light room when the plans were drawn for her creation.She was gay-hearted and full of tender, whimsical fancies.Once she let Mr. Skidder read to her three acts of his great (unpublished) comedy, “It’s No Kid; or, The Heir of the Subway.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每当利森小姐有空在台阶上坐上一两个钟头时，男房客们都会乐开了花。但是，有位在公立学校教书的高个金发的朗奈克小姐，不论你说什么，她总会回道“对，没错儿！”，此时她却坐在最高一级台阶上嗤鼻冷笑。而且，那位在百货商店上班、每个周日都去康奈岛打活动木鸭的多恩小姐，也会坐在最低一级台阶上嗤鼻冷笑。利森小姐一坐到中间的台阶上，男士们会马上把她围起来。</td>
		<td class="en">There was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two.But Miss Longnecker, the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said, “Well, really!” to everything you said, sat on the top step and sniffed.And Miss Dorn, who shot at the moving ducks at Coney every Sunday and worked in a department store, sat on the bottom step and sniffed.Miss Leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >特别是斯基德先生，他嘴上不说，心里却已经把她当成他现实生活中私人浪漫剧的主角了。还有胡佛先生，他四十五岁，体态臃肿，脸色通红，傻里傻气。还有非常年轻的埃文斯先生，他老是装模作样地干咳，好吸引利森小姐劝他戒烟。男士们推选她为“最有趣、最快乐的人”，但是来自台阶顶级和底级的嗤鼻声却不肯妥协。</td>
		<td class="en">Especially Mr. Skidder, who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private, romantic (unspoken) drama in real life.And especially Mr. Hoover, who was forty-five, fat, flush and foolish.And especially very young Mr. Evans, who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes.The men voted her “the funniest and jolliest ever,” but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我恳求诸位允许这场戏暂停一会儿，好让合唱团阔步走到台前，为胡佛先生的肥胖洒一滴哀悼的泪水。调好乐器来哀悼脂肪的悲剧、臃肿的祸根和肥胖的灾难吧。试想，如果魅力与体重成正比，那么福斯塔夫的风流韵事原本应该会远远多于瘦骨嶙峋的罗密欧。情人可以叹息，却不能呼哧喘气。胖子是归嘲笑和非难指摘之神莫摩斯处置的。腰围超过五十二英寸的人，就算你那忠诚至极的心脏跳得再欢，也是枉然。滚一边去吧，胡佛！四十五岁、脸色通红、傻里傻气的胡佛还有可能拐走美人海伦；但四十五岁、脸色通红、傻里傻气、臃肿肥胖的胡佛却只是一具等着堕入地狱的臭皮囊罢了。你永远不会有机会的，胡佛。</td>
		<td class="en">I pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of Mr. Hoover.Tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow, the bane of bulk, the calamity of corpulence.Tried out, Falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have Romeo’s rickety ribs to the ounce.A lover may sigh, but he must not puff.To the train of Momus are the fat men remanded.In vain beats the faithfullest heart above a 52-inch belt.Avaunt, Hoover!Hoover, forty-five, flush and foolish, might carry off Helen herself; Hoover, forty-five, flush, foolish and fat is meat for perdition.There was never a chance for you, Hoover.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个夏日的晚上，帕克太太的房客们照旧坐在一起，利森小姐抬头仰望苍穹，她高兴地笑着喊道：</td>
		<td class="en">As Mrs. Parker’s roomers sat thus one summer’s evening, Miss Leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呀，那不是比利·杰克逊吗！我在这儿也能看到它呀。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, there’s Billy Jackson!I can see him from down here, too.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大家都抬起头——有人看向摩天大楼的窗户，有人四处寻找一架由杰克逊驾驶的飞船。</td>
		<td class="en">All looked up—some at the windows of skyscrapers, some casting about for an airship, Jackson-guided.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是那颗星星。”利森小姐伸出一根纤细的手指，指向天空解释道，“不是那颗一闪一闪的大星星——是它旁边那颗一动不动的蓝色的星星。每天晚上我都可以透过天窗看到它。我叫它比利·杰克逊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s that star,” explained Miss Leeson, pointing with a tiny finger.“Not the big one that twinkles—the steady blue one near it.I can see it every night through my skylight.I named it Billy Jackson.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，没错儿！”朗奈克小姐说，“我不知道你还是个天文学家呢，利森小姐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, really!” said Miss Longnecker.“I didn’t know you were an astronomer, Miss Leeson.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，是的，”凝望星星的小人儿说，“关于火星居民明年秋天要穿什么新样式的衣服，我知道的不比任何一个天文学家少。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, yes,” said the small star gazer, “I know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they’re going to wear next fall in Mars.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，没错！”朗奈克小姐说，“你指的那颗星星是伽马星，位于仙后星座。它接近于二等星，它的子午线程是——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, really!” said Miss Longnecker.“The star you refer to is Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia.It is nearly of the second magnitude, and its meridian passage is—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，”非常年轻的埃文斯先生说，“我认为比利·杰克逊对它来说是个好得多的名字。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh,” said the very young Mr. Evans, “I think Billy Jackson is a much better name for it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我同意，”胡佛先生说，粗声粗气地反对朗奈克小姐，“我认为利森小姐和那些老占星家们有一样的权利来给星星命名。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Same here,” said Mr. Hoover, loudly breathing defiance to Miss Longnecker.“I think Miss Leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，没错！”朗奈克小姐说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, really!” said Miss Longnecker.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我在想它是不是颗流星。”多恩小姐说，“星期天，我在康奈岛的打靶场上，十发子弹打中了九次鸭子，一次兔子。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I wonder whether it’s a shooting star,” remarked Miss Dorn.“I hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney Sunday.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从这下面看不是很清楚。”利森小姐说，“你们应该去我房里看他。要知道从井底往上看的话，就算大白天也能看到星星。一到晚上，我的房间就像煤矿的竖井，而比利·杰克逊就像夜女神别在她睡衣上的大钻石胸针。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He doesn’t show up very well from down here,” said Miss Leeson.“You ought to see him from my room.You know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well.At night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine, and it makes Billy Jackson look like the big diamond pin that Night fastens her kimono with.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后有一段时间，利森小姐不再带回家一大堆稿子打字了。早上出门后，她也不是去工作，而是找遍一家家事务所，却只能从傲慢的勤杂工那儿遭到冷冰冰的拒绝；她的心一天天沉了下去。这样的情形持续了好一段时间。</td>
		<td class="en">There came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy.And when she went out in the morning, instead of working, she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys.This went on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有天晚上，她疲惫不堪地爬上帕克太太的台阶，平常这个时候，她总是刚在餐馆吃了晚饭回来。可是这天她没有吃饭。</td>
		<td class="en">There came an evening when she wearily climbed Mrs. Parker’s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant.But she had had no dinner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她走进门厅的时候，胡佛先生碰见了她，赶忙抓住了这次机会。他要向她求婚，他的一身肥肉在她面前晃动，像随时会崩塌的雪山。她躲开他，抓住了楼梯扶手。他想拉住她的手，她抬起手，有气无力地打了他一巴掌。她拉着扶手，一步一步地往上挪。她经过斯基德先生的房门时，他正在用红墨水为他那（未被采用的）喜剧中默特尔·德洛姆（就是利森小姐）这个角色修改演出说明，好让她“旋转着脚尖从舞台左侧跳到伯爵身边”。最后，利森小姐终于爬上了铺着毡毯的梯子，打开了带天窗房间的房门。</td>
		<td class="en">As she stepped into the hall Mr. Hoover met her and seized his chance.He asked her to marry him, and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche.She dodged, and caught the balustrade.He tried for her hand, and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face.Step by step she went up, dragging herself by the railing.She passed Mr. Skidder’s door as he was red-inking a stage direction for Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson) in his (unaccepted) comedy, to “pirouette across stage from L to the side of the Count.”Up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她太累了，没力气开灯和换衣服。她倒在铁床上，瘦弱的身躯几乎都没把旧弹簧垫压下去一点儿。在如阴阳间的黑暗界一样幽暗的天窗房里，她缓缓抬起沉重的眼睑，微微笑了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">She was too weak to light the lamp or to undress.She fell upon the iron cot, her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs.And in that Erebus of the skylight room, she slowly raised her heavy eyelids, and smiled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为比利·杰克逊正透过天窗照耀着她，安静、明亮、恒定。她周围的世界消失了。她沉入黑暗的深渊，只剩一小块微弱的亮光，里面镶嵌着星星，那颗被她赋予如此古怪，哦，又如此不合适的名字的星星。朗奈克小姐一定是对的；它是仙后星座的伽马星，不是什么比利·杰克逊。然而，她还是无法开口叫它伽马。</td>
		<td class="en">For Billy Jackson was shining down on her, calm and bright and constant through the skylight.There was no world about her.She was sunk in a pit of blackness, with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh, so ineffectually named.Miss Longnecker must be right; it was Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia, and not Billy Jackson.And yet she could not let it be Gamma.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她仰面躺在那儿，两次试着抬起胳膊。第三次她总算把两根纤细的手指放在唇边，从黑暗的深渊里朝比利·杰克逊送去了一个飞吻。她的胳膊无力地垂了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">As she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm.The third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to Billy Jackson.Her arm fell back limply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再见了，比利，”她喃喃低语道，“你远在几百万英里之外，而且不肯眨一下眼睛。但是当四周一片黑暗，什么也看不到时，你总是呆在上面，在我可以看到的地方，不是吗？……几百万英里啊……再见了，比利·杰克逊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good-bye, Billy,” she murmured faintly.“You’re millions of miles away and you won’t even twinkle once.But you kept where I could see you most of the time up there when there wasn’t anything else but darkness to look at, didn’t you?...Millions of miles...Good-bye, Billy Jackson.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天上午十点钟，黑人女仆克拉拉发现利森小姐的房门还锁着，于是大家把门撞开了。用醋熏，拍打她的手腕，给她嗅烧焦的羽毛都不起作用，有人跑去打电话叫了救护车。</td>
		<td class="en">Clara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day, and they forced it open.Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail, some one ran to ’phone for an ambulance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没多久，救护车鸣叫着倒开进来停在门口，身着白色亚麻大褂、年轻干练的医生跳上了台阶。他沉着、灵活、自信，光洁的脸上露出半是潇洒，半是严肃的神情。</td>
		<td class="en">In due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the capable young medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active, confident, with his smooth face half debonair, half grim, danced up the steps.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“四十九号叫的救护车来了，”他利索地说，“出什么事儿了？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ambulance call to 49,” he said briefly.“What’s the trouble?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，是的，医生，”帕克太太轻蔑地说道，好像她的房子里出的事儿比什么事儿都麻烦，“我可弄不清她是怎么搞的。我们用尽了办法也救不醒她。她是个年轻女人，叫埃尔西——对，埃尔西·利森小姐。我这房子里以前从没——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, yes, doctor,” sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater.“I can’t think what can be the matter with her.Nothing we could do would bring her to.It’s a young woman, a Miss Elsie—yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson.Never before in my house—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哪个房间？”医生厉声喊道，帕克太太从没听过这么吓人的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">“What room?” cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs. Parker was a stranger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“带天窗的那间。它在——”</td>
		<td class="en">“The skylight room.It—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >显然，这位救护车随车医生十分熟悉天窗房的位置。他一步四级，冲上楼去。帕克太太端着架子，慢条斯理地跟在后面。</td>
		<td class="en">Evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms.He was gone up the stairs, four at a time.Mrs. Parker followed slowly, as her dignity demanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她刚到第一个楼梯口，就看见医生抱着小天文学家下来了。他停下来，用像熟练的手术刀一样利索的舌头数落起了帕克太太，不过声音并不高。帕克太太像从钉子上滑落的笔挺的衣服一样，慢慢瘫倒，皱缩成一团。从此之后，她的身心就永远留下了这些褶皱的印记。有时，好奇的房客们会问她医生到底和她说了些什么。</td>
		<td class="en">On the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms.He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue, not loudly.Gradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail.Ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body.Sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“算了吧，”她总会这样答道，“如果听了那些话能让我得到宽恕，我也就满足了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Let that be,” she would answer.“If I can get forgiveness for having heard it I will be satisfied.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >救护车随车医生抱着病人，大步穿过凑热闹的人群，周围的人们羞愧地退到一旁的人行道上，因为他脸上的神情让人觉得他抱着的是自己死去的亲人。</td>
		<td class="en">The ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed, for his face was that of one who bears his own dead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们注意到，他并没有把抱着的人放到救护车里的专用担架上，他只是对司机说了句：“快点开吧，威尔逊。”</td>
		<td class="en">They noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried, and all that he said was: “Drive like h—l, Wilson,” to the driver.</td></tr>
