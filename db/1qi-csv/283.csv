"得了条明眼狗","Get a Seeing-Eyed Dog "
"作者：欧内斯特·海明威","by Ernest Hemingway"
"“后来我们做什么了？”他问她。她告诉了他。","“And what did we do then?”He asked her.She told him."
"“这部分很陌生。我一点也想不起来了。”","“That part is very strange.I can’t remember that at all.”"
"“你还记得旅行队走时的情形吗？”","“Can you remember the safari leaving?”"
"“应该记得。但是想不起来。我记得女人们沿着小路到河滩边取水，她们头上顶着罐子，我还记得鹅群被那个小孩子来来回回地赶进水里。我记得它们都走得那么慢，总是不是下去就是上来。潮水也涨得很高，河滩的平地上一片黄色，河道经过远处的小岛。风一直在吹，没有苍蝇，也没有蚊子。上面是屋顶，下面是水泥地，中间有柱子撑起屋顶，整天都有风从中间穿过。白天很凉快，晚上更凉爽舒服。”","“I should.But I don’t.I remember the women going down the trail to the beach for the water with the pots on their heads and I remember the flock of geese the toto drove back and forth to the water.I remember how slowly they all went and they were always going down or coming up.There was a very big tide too and the flats were yellow and the channel ran by the far island.The wind blew all the time and there were no flies and no mosquitoes.There was a roof and a cement floor and the poles that held the roof up, and the wind blew through them all the time.It was cool all day and lovely and cool at night.”"
"“你还记得吗，有一次低潮的时候，那艘大独桅船是斜着驶进来的？”","“Do you remember when the big dhow came in and careened on the low tide?”"
"“对，我记得这条船，船员们都乘着小船上了岸，从河滩上沿着小路走来，鹅群怕他们，女人们也怕。”","“Yes, I remember her and the crew coming ashore in her boats and coming up the path from the beach, and the geese were afraid of them and so were the women.”"
"“就是那天我们抓了很多鱼，可是因为天气恶劣不得不回来。”","“That was the day we caught so many fish but had to come in because it was rough.”"
"“我记得。”","“I remember that.”"
"“你今天记起了很多事，”她说，“别太费心思了。”","“You’re remembering well today,” she said.“Don’t do it too much.”"
"“害你没能飞去桑给巴尔，真是抱歉，”他说，“我们当时住的地方再往上的河滩倒是个适合降落的好地方。在那里飞机降落、起飞都没什么问题。”","“I’m sorry you didn’t get to fly to Zanzibar,” he said.“That upper beach from where we were was a fine place to land.You could have landed and taken off from there quite easily.”"
"“我们随时可以去桑给巴尔。今天别费神想那么多了。我给你念段文章好不好？过期的《纽约人》里经常有些被我们漏掉的好文章。”","“We can always go to Zanzibar.Don’t try to remember too much today.Would you like me to read to you?There’s always something in the old New Yorkers that we missed.”"
"“不好，请别念，”他说，“就说说话吧。说说那些好日子。”","“No, please don’t read,” he said.“Just talk.Talk about the good days.”"
"“你想听听外边是什么情形吗？”","“Do you want to hear about what it’s like outside?”"
"“在下雨，”他说，“我知道。”","“It’s raining,” he said.“I know that.”"
"“在下大雨，”她告诉他，“这样的天气，游人们是不会出门的。风很大，我们下楼去炉火边坐坐吧。”","“It’s raining a big rain,” she told him.“There won’t be any tourists out with this weather.The wind is very wild and we can go down and sit by the fire.”"
"“好啊。我不再对他们感兴趣了。我想听他们说话。”","“We could anyway.I don’t care about them any more.I like to hear them talk.”"
"“有些人很讨厌，”她说，“不过有些人是很高雅的。我觉得到托尔契罗去的那些游人是最高雅的。”","“Some of them are awful,” she said.“But some of them are quite nice.I think it’s really the nicest ones that go out to Torcello.”"
"“说得很对，”他说，“我倒是没想过。他们若是不高雅，到那里的确没什么可看的。”","“That’s quite true,” he said.“I hadn’t thought of that.There’s really nothing for them to see unless they are a bit too nice.”"
"“我给你弄杯酒好吗？”她说，“你知道护理工作我真是做不好。我没受过训练，也没有什么天赋。不过我会调酒。”","“Can I make you a drink?” she asked.“You know how worthless a nurse I am.I wasn’t trained for it and I haven’t any talent.But I can make drinks.”"
"“我们喝一杯吧。”","“Let’s have a drink.”"
"“你想喝什么？”","“What do you want?”"
"“什么都行。”他说。","“Anything,” he said."
"“我要给你个惊喜。我要去楼下调酒。”","“I’ll make a surprise.I’ll make it downstairs.”"
"他听见门开了又关上，听见她走在楼梯上的脚步声，他想，我一定得让她去旅行一次。我得想个办法把这事办成。我得找个实际点的办法。我后半辈子就这样了，我得想些法子别毁了她的生活，毁了她。她一直好好的，不过她的体质并不怎么好。我指的是这种好。我的意思是每天都很好，纯粹意义上的好。","He heard the door open and close and her feet on the stairs and he thought, I must get her to go on a trip.I must figure out some way to do it.I have to think up something practical.I’ve got this now for the rest of my life and I must figure out ways not to destroy her life and ruin her with it.She has been so good and she was not built to be good.I mean this sort of good.I mean good every day and dull good."
"他听见她上楼了，他还注意到她手里端着两杯酒和刚才空手下楼时的脚步声有所不同。他听见了雨打在窗玻璃上的声音，闻到了壁炉里烧着的山毛榉木头的味道。她进屋的时候，他伸出手接酒，握紧了酒杯，感觉到她过来碰了碰杯。","He heard her coming up the stairs and noticed the difference in her tread when she was carrying two glasses and when she had walked down bare-handed.He heard the rain on the windowpane and he smelled the beech logs burning in the fireplace.As she came into the room he put his hand out for the drink and closed his hand on it and felt her touch the glass with her own."
"“是我们来这里以后常喝的酒，”她说，“加冰的堪培利和戈登酒。”","“It’s our old drink for out here,” she said.“Campari and Gordon’s with ice.”"
"“我很高兴，你不像别的姑娘那样，说‘有暗礁’。”“不，”她说，“我是不会那么说的。我们已经触过礁了。”","“I’m certainly glad you’re not a girl who would say ‘on the rocks.’”“No,” she said.“I wouldn’t ever say that.We’ve been on the rocks.”"
"“在紧要关头，我们永远得靠自己努力挺住，”他记起来了，“你还记得我们什么时候开始忌讳这些话的吗？”","“On our own two feet when the chips were down and for keeps,” he remembered.“Do you remember when we barred those phrases?”"
"“是在弄到我那头狮子的时候。真是头雄壮的狮子，不是吗？我等不及想见见他了。”","“That was in the time of my lion.Wasn’t he a wonderful lion?I can’t wait till we see him.”"
"“我也等不及了。”他说。","“I can’t either,” he said."
"“对不起。”","“I’m sorry.”"
"“你还记得我们什么时候起开始忌讳这句话的？”","“Do you remember when we barred that phrase?”"
"“我刚差点又说出来了。”","“I nearly said it again.”"
"“你知道，”他告诉她，“我们能来这里真是幸运。我记得很清楚，仿佛就发生在眼前。这个词第一次用，以后也要忌讳了。不过真是太棒了。我听到雨声的时候，就能看见雨点打在石头上，运河里和湖面上，我知道在怎样的风里树是怎样弯的，在怎样的光线中教堂和塔楼是怎样的情形。对我来说，再没有更合适的地方了。真是太完美了。我们有好的收音机，好的录音机，我会写出比以前好很多的文章。如果肯下工夫，有了录音机就能找到合适的词句了。我可以慢慢做，我只要把句子说出来，也就能看见了。要是有什么不妥，我就重来，仔细研究，直到找到合适的。亲爱的，这在很多方面真是再好不过了。”","“You know,” he told her, “we’re awfully lucky to have come here.I remember it so well that it is palpable.That’s a new word and we’ll bar it soon.But it really is wonderful.When I hear the rain I can see it on the stones and on the canal and on the lagoon, and I know the way the trees bend in every wind and how the church and the tower are in every sort of light.We couldn’t have come to a better place for me.It’s really perfect.We’ve got the good radio and a fine tape recorder and I’m going to write better than I ever could.If you take your time with the tape recorder you can get the words right.I can work slow and I can see the words when I say them.If they’re wrong I hear them wrong and I can do them over and work on them until I get them right.Honey, in lots of ways we couldn’t have it better.”"
"“哦，菲利普……”“狗屁，”他说，“看不见不过就是看不见。这跟真正的黑暗可不一样。我内心能看得清清楚楚，现在我的脑子也一天天好起来了，我能记起以前的事了，还能充分发挥想象。你等着看吧。我今天不是记起更多了吗？”","“Oh, Philip—” “Shit,” he said.“The dark is just the dark.This isn’t like the real dark.I can see very well inside and now my head is better all the time and I can remember and I can make up well.You wait and see.Didn’t I remember better today?”"
"“你一直都在进步。你的身体也渐渐强壮了。”","“You remember better all the time.And you’re getting strong.”"
"“我很强壮，”他说，“那么你是不是可以……”“我可以怎么样？”","“I am strong,” he said.“Now if you—” “If me what?”"
"“你可以出去一阵子，休息一下，换换环境。”","“If you’d go away for a while and get a rest and a change from this.”"
"“你不需要我了？”","“Don’t you want me?”"
"“我当然需要你啊，亲爱的。”","“Of course I want you, darling.”"
"“那为什么谈让我出门的事？我知道我不是很会照顾你，不过我可以做别人做不来的事情，而且我们彼此相爱。你爱我，这你也知道，我们之间互相了解的事情，别人是无法知道的。”","“Then why do we have to talk about me going away?I know I’m not good at looking after you but I can do things other people can’t do and we do love each other.You love me and you know it and we know things nobody else knows.”"
"“在黑暗中我们过得很好。”他说。","“We do wonderful things in the dark,” he said."
"“我们白天也过得很好。”","“And we did wonderful things in the daytime too.”"
"“你知道我倒更喜欢黑暗。从某种意义上讲，这倒更好。”","“You know I rather like the dark.In some ways it is an improvement.”"
"“别撒谎撒过头了，”她说，“你没必要装得这么高尚。”","“Don’t lie too much,” she said.“You don’t have to be so bloody noble.”"
"“听，下雨呢，”他说，“现在的潮情怎样？”","“Listen to it rain,” he said.“How is the tide now?”"
"“潮水退得很低了，风一吹，水位就更低了。差不多可以走着去布拉诺了。”","“It’s way out and the wind has driven the water even further out.You could almost walk to Burano.”"
"“除了一个地方都可以走着去了，”他说，“有很多鸟吗？”","“All except one place,” he said.“Are there many birds?”"
"“大多是海鸥和燕鸥。它们都落在河滩低地上，风大，飞不起来。”","“Mostly gulls and terns.They are down on the flats and when they get up the wind catches them.”"
"“没有水鸟吗？”","“Aren’t there any shore birds?”"
"“有一些，只有遇上这样的大风、这样的潮位，河滩低地才露出水面，水鸟才会在上面活动活动。”","“There are a few working on the part of the flats that only comes out when we have this wind and this tide.”"
"“你觉得会有春天吗？”","“Do you think it will ever be spring?”"
"“我不知道，”她说，“看样子是不会有了。”","“I don’t know,” she said.“It certainly doesn’t act like it.”"
"“你的酒都喝完了吗？”","“Have you drunk all your drink?”"
"“快了。你的为什么不喝？”","“Just about.Why don’t you drink yours?”"
"“我留着它。”","“I was saving it.”"
"“都喝光吧，”她说，“你不能喝酒的时候不是很难受吗？”“不，你知道，”他说，“你下楼的时候我在想，你可以去巴黎，然后去伦敦，你可以见见各种各样的人，痛快地玩玩，然后再回来，到那时就是春天了，你可以把一切都讲给我听。”“不。”她说。","“Drink it up,” she said.“Wasn’t it awful when you couldn’t drink at all?”“No, you see,” he said.“What I was thinking about when you went downstairs was that you could go to Paris and then to London and you’d see people and could have some fun and then you’d come back and it would have to be spring by then and you could tell me all about everything.”“No,” she said."
"“我觉得这么做挺明智的，”他说，“你知道这种乏味的生活可不是一天两天的事，我们得学会调整生活节奏。我可不想把你累坏了。你知道——”“你别老说‘你知道’行不行。”","“I think it would be intelligent to do,” he said.“You know this is a long sort of stupid business and we have to learn to pace ourselves.And I don’t want to wear you out.You know—”“I wish you wouldn’t say ‘you know’ so much.”"
"“你明白吗？这是最要紧的一件事。至于说话，我一定学着不让你生气。等你回来的时候，你没准会喜欢得发狂呢。”","“You see?That’s one of the things.I could learn to talk in a non-irritating way.You might be mad about me when you came back.”"
"“你晚上怎么办？”","“What would you do nights?”"
"“晚上好办啊。”","“Nights are easy.”"
"“我就知道肯定好办。我猜你也学会怎么睡觉了吧。”","“I’ll bet they are.I suppose you’ve learned how to sleep too.”"
"“我会学会的，”他告诉她，喝了半杯酒。“这是计划的一部分。你知道我的计划是这样的。你要是出门好好玩的话，我也会心安。那么我这辈子头一次心安，自然就睡着了。我拿一个枕头，代表我无愧的心，我抱着它就能入睡了。要是我偶然醒来的话，我就想想那些又美又甜又见不得光的事。要不就好好下个决心。要不就想想过去的事。你知道我想让你痛快玩玩去——”“请别再说‘你知道’。”“我会注意的，尽量不说。这也是忌讳，我给忘了，一不留神说漏嘴了。无论如何，我不希望你只当一只明眼狗。”","“I’m going to,” he told her and drank half the drink.“That’s part of The Plan.You know this is how it works.If you go away and have some fun then I have a good conscience.Then for the first time in my life with a good conscience I sleep automatically.I take a pillow which represents my good conscience and I put my arms around it and off I go to sleep.If I wake up by any odd chance I just think beautiful happy dirty thoughts.Or I make wonderful fine good resolutions.Or I remember things.You know I want you to have fun—” “Please don’t say ‘you know.’” “I’ll concentrate on not saying it.It’s barred but I forget and let the bars down.Anyway I don’t want you just to be a seeing-eyed dog.”"
"“我不是，你知道的。是导盲犬，不是明眼狗。”","“I’m not and you know it.Anyway it’s seeing-eye not seeing-eyed.”"
"“我知道的，”他跟她说，“来坐到这里，你不介意吧？”她过来，挨着他坐在床上，他们都听见雨点狠狠地打在窗玻璃上，他想尽力不用盲人那样的动作去摸她的头和她可爱的脸，可是不这样的话，他又怎能摸到她的脸。他紧紧抱住她，吻了吻她的头顶。他想，我改天还得再劝劝她。在这件事上我可不能犯傻。她摸起来是那么可爱，我这么爱她，却给她带去太多的伤害，我必须竭尽所能好好照顾她。只要想着她，只想着她，一切都会好的。","“I knew that,” he told her.“Come and sit here, would you mind very much?”She came and sat by him on the bed and they both heard the rain hard against the pane of the window and he tried not to feel her head and her lovely face the way a blind man feels and there was no other way that he could touch her face except that way.He held her close and kissed the top of her head.I will have to try it another day, he thought.I must not be so stupid about it.She feels so lovely and I love her so much and have done her so much damage and I must learn to take good care of her in every way I can.If I think of her and of her only, everything will be all right."
"“我不会再一直说‘你知道’了，”他跟她说，“我们以此作为开始吧。”","“I won’t say ‘you know’ all the time any more,” he told her.“We can start with that.”"
"她摇头，他能感觉到她在颤抖。","She shook her head and he could feel her tremble."
"“你想说就说吧。”她吻着他说。","“You say it all you want,” she said and kissed him."
"“别哭，亲爱的。”他说。","“Please don’t cry, my blessed,” he said."
"“我不想让你抱着脏枕头睡。”她说。","“I don’t want you to sleep with any lousy pillow,” she said."
"“不会的。不要脏枕头。”","“I won’t.Not any lousy pillow.”"
"打住，他对自己说。马上打住。","Stop it, he said to himself.Stop it right now."
"“听着，”他说，“我们现在下楼去，到炉火边舒服的老地方吃午餐去吧，让我告诉你，你是只多好的猫。我们是多幸运的一对猫。”","“Look, tu,” he said.“We’ll go down now and have lunch in our old fine place by the fire and I’ll tell you what a wonderful kitten you are and what lucky kittens we are.”"
"“我们确实是。”","“We really are.”"
"“我们会把一切都安排好的。”","“We’ll work everything out fine.”"
"“我只是不想被你打发走。”","“I just don’t want to be sent away.”"
"“没人打发你走。”","“Nobody is ever going to send you away.”"
"可是扶着扶手，小心翼翼地探着每个台阶下楼的时候，他在想，我一定得尽快让她去，但是不能伤害她。因为这事我办得不太好。我承认的确不好。但是你还能怎么做呢？没有办法，他想。实在是没有办法。不过，也许开始做了，慢慢就做好了。","But walking down the stairs feeling each stair carefully and holding to the banister he thought, I must get her away and get her away as soon as I can without hurting her.Because I am not doing too well at this.That I can promise you.But what else can you do?Nothing, he thought.There’s nothing you can do.But maybe, as you go along, you will get good at it."
