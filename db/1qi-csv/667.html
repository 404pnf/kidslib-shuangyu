		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两年前，我在《技术教育和资本主义工业化：西欧和美国技术力量形成问题研究》一文（1978年北京大学“五四”科学讨论会上的报告，发表于《社会科学战线》1978年第4期）中，曾从经济史的角度对教育同经济增长的关系作过一些分析。在那篇文章里，我所着重考察的是：教育是培养一国技术力量的主要途径；后进国家提高经济增长率以及在经济上赶上和超过先进国家的原因之一就是重视教育、重视人才的培养。关于教育在经济增长中的作用，在该文中归纳为以下五点：</td>
		<td class="en">In my speech “Technology education and capitalist industrialization: a study of the rise of technological power in Western Europe and America,”[^1]I dwelled on the relationship between education and economic growth in light of economic history. What I was driving at was that education is a major recourse for nations to groom technological personnel, and that only by putting a premium on education and the cultivation of talents can less developed nations boost their economic growth rates and catch up with and surpass the developed countries. As I put it in that speech, the role of education in economic growth has five aspects:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“第一，它向社会提供一支能在科学上有发现、发明，在生产技术上有创新、变革的科学研究和设计队伍。如果没有这样一支队伍，在科学技术上至多只能步别国的后尘，很难取得重大的突破。</td>
		<td class="en">“First, education provides society with a supply of researchers and designers who can venture into the unknown, innovating in science, renovating and transforming productive technology. Without such contingents, the best a nation can do is to tag along after other nations, but in that way you cannot score major breakthroughs in science and technology.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二，它向社会提供一支能掌握和运用先进生产方法的技术队伍。如果没有这样一支队伍，即使有了先进的生产工具和生产方法，它们也不可能充分发挥作用。</td>
		<td class="en">“Second, education provides society with engineers and technicians who can master and apply advanced means of production. Without such technocrats, even if a nation has acquired sophisticated tools of production, it cannot put them to best use.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第三，它向社会提供一支适应于工业化水平的生产和技术管理人员的队伍。如果没有这样一支队伍，就会造成生产过程中人力、物力、财力的巨大浪费，就不能发挥先进生产技术的优越性。</td>
		<td class="en">“Third, education brings forth production and technology managers well adapted to society's level of industrialization. Without teams of such managers, the production process can be prone to colossal waste in human, material and financial resources, making it impossible to benefit from the superiority of advanced productive technology.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第四，它提高全社会的科学文化水平，为新产品的推广使用、为先进科学技术知识的普及和提高准备条件，同时也为今后技术力量的成长提供广阔的基础，为源源不断的高质量的科研人员、工程技术人员、管理人员和熟练工人的供给提供保证。</td>
		<td class="en">“Fourth, education enhances society’s scientific and cultural attainment, and sets the stage for promoting new products and disseminating and upgrading knowledge in science and technology. At the same time, education also lays the groundwork for the future growth of a nation’s technological prowess, and guarantees the supply of a constant stream of high-caliber researchers, engineers and managers, and skilled workers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第五，它使社会积累起来的科学知识和生产经验得以保存和传播，这种传播可以不受国界的限制，也不受时间的限制。累积起来的科学知识和生产经验作为人类共同财富，通过教育从一个民族传播给另一个民族，从这一代传播给下一代。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Fifth, education enables society to preserve and disseminate its accumulation of scientific knowledge and productive experience free from barriers of time and space and national boundaries. It is through education that such accumulated knowledge and experience are spread from one nation to another and from one generation to another as humanity’s shared assets.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >本文以两年前发表的那篇文章为基础，继续考察教育同经济增长的关系。但这两篇文章的着重点有所不同。前一篇文章分析教育在促进一国经济增长和提高经济增长率方面的重要作用，本文分析教育在保证一国经济稳定、持续增长，以及有效地解决经济增长过程中发生的或可能发生的各种问题方面的重要作用。换言之，前一篇文章考察的范围在于经济增长本身，本文考察的范围在于稳定、持续经济增长过程中的社会就业、国际收支、收入分配、财政平衡等问题。此外，前一篇文章是从西欧和美国经济史的角度进行考察的，本文则以当前我国社会主义经济作为考察的对象。</td>
		<td class="en">I would like to go on with my observation of the relationship between education and economic growth on the basis of the speech I made and published two years ago. However, this paper has a different focus. While in my previous speech I looked into the major role education plays in expanding the economy and raising its growth rate, this paper underlines education’s important role in ensuring economic stability and sustained growth, and in providing effective solutions to problems that have occurred or may occur in the process of economic growth. In other words, my previous speech was about economic growth *per se*, whereas this paper is a study of employment, balance of international payments, income distribution, financial balance and other issues occurring in the process of stabilizing and sustaining economic growth. Furthermore, while my previous speech proceeded from the perspective of the economic history of Western Europe and America, this paper takes China’s socialist economy as its focus and background.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >本文分为四部分，分别考察教育与社会就业、国际收支、收入分配、财政平衡之间的关系，说明教育在保证经济稳定、持续增长中的作用。</td>
		<td class="en">This paper is delivered in four sections dealing respectively with education’s relationship with employment, balance of international payments, income distribution, and fiscal balance, so as to illustrate education’s role in guaranteeing economic stability and sustained growth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一、我国当前社会就业问题的“结构性”。这种“结构性”就业问题要依靠发展教育和调整教育结构来解决</td>
		<td class="en">I. The “structural” nature of the employment problem can be solved by developing and restructuring education</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从理论上说，任何一个国家的经济增长既可以通过增加劳动力数量来实现，也可以不通过增加劳动力数量，而通过增加对机器设备的投资，并相应地提高劳动者的技术水平和熟练程度来实现。在经济增长过程中，由于物质生产部门采用节约劳动的新技术设备的结果，有可能减少对劳动力数量的需要。因此，在一定的人口增长率条件下，经济增长本身并不能保证充分就业。物质生产部门在增加生产量的过程中究竟能够吸收多少人就业，不仅取决于这些部门的增长速度，而且取决于这些部门采取什么样的经济增长途径。如果一国主要不是依靠增加劳动力数量，而是依靠新技术设备的采用和劳动力文化技术水平的提高来实现经济增长的话，物质生产部门本身能吸收的劳动力将是有限的。</td>
		<td class="en">Theoretically speaking, any nation can grow its economy either by expanding its workforce or by investing more in machines and equipment and improving workers’ technical know how and skills. The adoption of labor-saving technology and equipment may help cut down the material production sector’s demand for workers in the course of economic growth. Consequently, given a constant population growth rate, economic growth itself cannot ensure full employment. The number of jobs to be created through output increase is determined not only by the rate of production expansion, but also by which approaches are adopted for such expansion. If a country develops its economy not by hiring more workers but by adopting new technology and equipment and improving workers’ cultural and technical proficiency, then the ability of its material production sector to absorb the workforce will be limited.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一方面，一国经济增长过程也是一国经济结构变化的过程。在物质生产领域内，必然有些部门或行业衰落下去，甚至被淘汰，另一些部门或行业则不断兴起、发展。物质生产领域与非物质生产领域在国民经济中的比重也会发生变化，非物质生产领域的一些部门的发展及其在国民经济中所占比重的增大，是经济增长的不可避免的趋势。在衰落和被淘汰的部门就业的劳动者，随着国民经济结构的变化，需要另谋职业，转移工作部门。在新兴的物质生产部门中，尤其是在日益发展的非物质生产部门中，劳动力则往往是不足的。因此，一国经济增长过程之所以能够增加就业，从长期趋势来看，主要依靠新兴物质生产部门的发展和各种非物质生产部门的发展。</td>
		<td class="en">On the other hand, economic growth also entails a process of change in a nation’s economic structure. The inexorable law of material production is that some old manufacturing industries decline or are phased out while new ones rise and grow. The ratio between material and nonmaterial production in the national economy is changing as well. It is an irrevocable trend in economic growth for some nonmaterial production industries to grow in strength along with their shares in the national economy. With the national economic structure changing constantly, those working in languishing or failed industries need to find new jobs elsewhere. The rising industries in material production, and particularly the burgeoning industries in nonmaterial production, often run short of workforce. Thus in the long term, the emergence and growth of new industries in both material and nonmaterial production are major reasons why a nation can increase employment amidst economic growth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一国经济结构的变化不仅包括部门结构的变化，而且包括地区结构的变化。国内原来经济较不发达的地区在经济增长过程中可能以较快的速度增长，而原来经济比较发达的地区经济增长速度则可能减缓，或者以相对较慢的速度增长。这样，经济增长率较慢的地区，或者经济增长率虽高但主要依靠增加技术设备投资来实现经济增长的地区，劳动力将会过多，这些人也必须另找就业岗位。而经济增长率较高的地区，特别是原来劳动力不足的地区，则有可能吸收就业者。</td>
		<td class="en">The changing economic structure of a nation implies changes in both industrial and geo-economic structures. In China, underdeveloped regions may achieve a relatively higher economic growth rate, whereas developed regions may slow down, or grow at a relatively lower pace. Regions that either suffer a low growth rate or maintain a high growth rate mainly by spending more on technology and equipment will produce a glut of factory layoffs that will have to seek employment elsewhere, whereas regions with a high growth rate, those with a labor shortage in particular, are likely to accept the job-hunters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从上述这些情况来分析，可以清楚地看到，一国经济增长过程中所遇到的社会就业问题，主要是“结构性”就业问题。这就是说，社会就业问题能否顺利地得到解决，要看劳动力的结构（不同技术水平的劳动力、不同工种的劳动力、不同地区的劳动力在劳动力总数中的构成）与经济增长速度是否适应，与经济结构的变化是否适应，要看劳动力本身在技术方面是否符合经济增长的要求。在劳动力结构与经济增长速度、经济结构变化不适应的情况下，在劳动者的技术水平不符合经济增长要求的情况下，经济增长过程中失业与职位空缺的并存将是不可避免的。</td>
		<td class="en">These situations prove clearly that the employment problem confronting a country in the process of economic growth is mainly “structural.” That is to say, the success or failure in tackling this problem hinges on whether the workforce structure — the makeup of workers of different trades, industries and locations in a region’s total number of workers — is commensurate with local economic growth rates and economic structural changes, and whether the workforce itself can meet the technical needs of local economic growth. When the structure of a workforce does not match the local economic growth rate and the changing local economic structure, and when workers’ technical proficiency level falls short of the needs of economic growth, unemployment will unavoidably exist alongside a surplus of unfilled job vacancies.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >失业与职位空缺并存，就是说，一方面是“人找事”，另一方面是“事找人”。经济增长过程中为什么会有失业？这是因为在经济增长主要靠提高劳动生产率来实现，而人口增长率又比较高时，新达到就业年龄的劳动力很可能找不到工作。即使不考虑新达到就业年龄的劳动力，那么增长率相对缓慢或停滞的部门和地区也会游离出一批劳动力。特别是对发展中国家来说，情况更为显著，因为在这样的国家中，农业一直在国民经济中占有重要地位，而农业中原来的劳动生产率一直是较低的。工业化过程中，从农业中游离出来的大量劳动力在社会上找不到可以容纳他们的工作岗位。因此，失业（包括隐蔽失业）是不可能避免的。</td>
		<td class="en">This paradoxical coexistence of unemployment and superfluous vacancies means that while people are looking frantically for jobs, many jobs are left unfilled. How is it that people lose jobs while the economy keeps growing? The answer is that if economic growth is achieved for the most part by raising labor productivity, while the population growth rate remains relatively high, those coming of employment age are likely to fail to land suitable jobs. Even if these people are a nonfactor, industries and regions with slow or stagnant growth lay off workers. This is particularly true of developing countries, where agriculture — known for its low labor productivity — often dominates the national economy. In the industrialization process, large numbers of villagers who have just quit farming may find it hard to land jobs. Unemployment — concealed unemployment[^2] included — thus becomes unavoidable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为什么同时又出现职位空缺？这主要是因为新兴的物质生产部门以及非物质生产领域内某些需要熟练劳动力的部门在劳动力结构与经济增长速度、经济结构不适应的情况下，找不到所需要的劳动者，例如技术工人、工程技术人员、科学研究人员、管理人员等。即使是原有的物质生产部门，如果它们的经济增长主要依靠采用新技术装备来实现，那么该部门内原来就业的劳动者也很可能不适合要求。因此这些部门也是缺少劳动力的。此外，职位空缺还可能出现于新发展的地区，因为这些地区本身无法提供所需要的劳动力。这种情况在发展中国家也是很突出的，因为这些国家中，由于历史的原因，适应于工业化要求的熟练劳动力尤其缺乏。</td>
		<td class="en">Why, then, are there vacancies that remain unoccupied? This is because, when the workforce structure does not tally with the prevailing economic growth rate and economic structure, the rising industries in both material and nonmaterial production cannot find what they want badly: skilled workers and competent engineers, technicians, researchers, and managers. The same labor shortage can also occur in established industries in material production that maintain growth by relying heavily on new technology and equipment, so much so that even workers on their payrolls cannot measure up to what such new technology and equipment require of them. Seemingly unwanted jobs may also occur in newly developed places where required workers are in short supply. This is an outstanding problem with developing countries, where, for historical reasons, skilled workers that can keep pace with industrialization are scarce.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一般说来，国民经济中的失业人数与职位空缺额不可能恰好相符。二者之间的比率随一国经济增长率、经济结构变化情况和劳动力结构调整情况而异。但即使失业人数与职位空缺额基本上相符，它们也不可能彼此抵消，因为在现代生产技术条件下，不同技术水平和工种的劳动力往往不可能替代。所以从长期趋势来看，一国经济增长过程中，失业与职位空缺并存的现象不是暂时性的，而很可能是持久性的，即旧的失业人员就业了，职位空缺现象消失了，但新的失业人员又出现了，新的职位空缺现象又产生了。失业（包括隐蔽失业）是人力资源的浪费，职位空缺是物质资源的浪费，失业与职位空缺的并存不仅不利于经济增长，而且将阻碍新技术的采用和推广，阻碍经济结构的必要调整，使一国经济停留在长期低效率的状态。特别是失业的长期化还会成为社会不稳定的一个重要因素。</td>
		<td class="en">Generally speaking, the number of the jobless can never match the number of jobs awaiting them in a national economy. The ratio between the two numbers differs with the changes and readjustments in a nation’s economic growth rate and economic and workforce structure. However, even if the two numbers match each other, they cannot offset each other, because workers of different proficiency levels and fields of work are not interchangeable under modern production and technological conditions. In the long run, the coexistence of unemployment and unfilled job vacancies in a nation’s economic growth is not temporary, but, most probably, perpetual. That is to say, job vacancies may disappear when long-time job-seekers have found their jobs, but will occur again when new layoffs arrive on the scene. Unemployment, concealed unemployment included, is a waste of human resources, while job vacancies left unfilled are a waste of material resources — for them to exist at the same time is not only detrimental to economic growth, but also holds back the adoption and popularization of new technology and economic restructuring. The result is that the economy remains mired in low efficiency. Chronic joblessness can also be a major destabilizing factor for society.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >总之，经济增长过程中的社会就业问题，很大程度上可以归结为经济增长过程中失业与职位空缺之间的矛盾无法得到解决。这就是社会就业的“结构性”。</td>
		<td class="en">In a nutshell, employment problems in a growing economy are attributable to the failure in reconciling the conflict between unemployment and unfilled job vacancies. Such is the “structural” nature of employment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我国的社会就业问题是复杂的。当前我们面临的社会就业问题，既有属于上述一般经济增长过程中带有普遍性的问题，又有作为发展中国家在经济发展过程中遇到的共同问题，还有我国所特有的问题。这三种问题是交织在一起的。属于一般经济增长过程中的问题，主要指先进机器使用和技术装备率提高后，物质生产部门中对劳动力的需求相对减少、对非熟练劳动力的需求甚至绝对减少。属于发展中国家经济发展中的共同问题，主要指在从农业社会转向工业社会的过程中，从农业中必然游离出大量非熟练劳动力，需要有就业岗位容纳他们。属于我国特有的问题，除了劳动管理体制不够完善以外，主要指十年动乱给国民经济造成了严重破坏，比例失调，使得劳动就业门路十分狭窄。加上50年代末、60年代初人口增长过速，以致二十岁左右的青年人如今大批走上或即将走上工作岗位，如果就业问题不能妥善解决，对社会和经济增长都是非常不利的。但与此同时，我国当前也存在熟练劳动力供给不足、在职人员劳动生产率低的问题。一方面许多待业青年没有工作岗位，另一方面不少工作岗位找不到适合的工作人员。劳动力总资源等于劳动力数量与劳动者平均技术熟练水平（劳动力质量的主要标志）的乘积。就这个意义上说，目前我国的劳动力总资源并不是十分丰富的，因为劳动力数量虽多，劳动者的平均技术熟练水平却比较低。</td>
		<td class="en">The employment problems confronting China are complicated. Some are universal to all economies, some are common to developing nations in economic development, but others are peculiarly China’s own. These three categories of employment problems are intertwined. The universal ones stem from the fact that the increasing use of sophisticated machines and technological equipment has whittled down producers’ need for workers, unskilled workers in particular. Those common to developing nations arise from the new job needs of large numbers of unskilled laborers that have just quit farming at the time of an agrarian society’s transition to industrialization. The employment problems peculiarly of China’s own are partly to be blamed on incompetent labor administration, but most of them are attributed to the lopsided economic development resulting from the ten-year chaos of the Cultural Revolution that considerably narrowed down people’s job options. These problems were aggravated by the excessive population growth in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Today, those born in those years are coming of age or will soon become eligible for jobs. If the employment problems for these people cannot be properly handled, both society and the economy will be in jeopardy. The situation is also complicated by a dire shortage of skilled workers and the low labor productivity of those in their jobs. The dilemma facing China today is that while many job-seeking youths are having trouble finding jobs, factories, too, find it hard to fill jobs with qualified workers. A nation’s aggregate volume of labor resources are derived by multiplying the total number of workers with their average level of technical competency — the chief indicator of labor quality. In that sense, China’s aggregate volume of labor resources is by no means abundant because its workers’ average skill proficiency is low despite their sheer numbers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >要使当前我国的社会就业问题得到妥善解决，归根到底有待于在经济增长过程中不断地创造出新的工作岗位。如果无法增加新的工作岗位，那么即使人口增长率很低，只要采用了新技术，对劳动力的需要仍会减少。但怎样才能增加新工作岗位呢？这里涉及社会主义制度下多种经济成分并存、社会主义公有制多种形式并存的问题，也涉及经济管理体制、技术创新类型、国民经济各部门比例关系以及经济增长速度等问题。这些方面的问题不是本文所要探讨的内容。本文所要讨论的是：假定通过所有制形式、体制、比例关系等方面的调整和改革，假定国民经济有较大幅度的增长，确实创造出相当多的新工作岗位，我国的社会就业问题能否得到解决呢？如果考虑到我国社会就业问题的“结构性”，那么可以断言，在教育事业没有相应的发展、教育结构未作相应的调整的条件下，劳动力结构与经济结构之间不相适应的情况是不会消除的。“人找事”和“事找人”的矛盾将会长期存在。教育对于解决就业问题的重要作用，正在于它有助于解决这一矛盾。</td>
		<td class="en">The solution to our nation’s employment problems, in the final analysis, is to create a constant supply of new jobs to keep pace with economic growth. If we cannot create new jobs, the need for labor will shrink with the adoption of new technology, even if population growth is kept at a low level. How to create new jobs? This involves the diverse economic sectors and forms of public ownership under the socialist system, as well as such factors as economic administration, various types of technical innovation, and the ratios between sectors and economic growth rate. These issues, however, are beyond the scope of this study. The topic at hand is this: Supposing substantial numbers of new jobs are created by readjusting and revamping the ownership structure, the economic system and the ratios between economic sectors, and by riding the nation’s robust economic growth, can the nation come to grips with its employment problems? Given the “structural” nature of employment in our country, we can assert categorically that the disparity between the structure of the workforce and that of the national economy will never be eradicated without corresponding development in education and without restructuring the education system. The dilemma between “people hunting for jobs” and “jobs seeking takers,” too, will remain for a long time to come. The important role of education in tackling employment problems rests precisely on its ability to deliver the nation from that dilemma.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >发展教育事业和增加对教育事业的支出，可以使劳动力的结构适合于经济增长对不同技术水平和不同工种的劳动力的需要。在这里，重要的问题是使教育的结构同经济增长速度、经济结构的变化相适应，根据长期经济增长的需要来调整各种类型学校的设置、各种专业的设置，以及作出各种不同学习期限的安排。从长期考察，不外乎以下两种可能性。一种可能性是：从长期看，待业人数和未来新达到就业年龄的人数之和可能小于预计的职位空缺额，那么调整的重点将放在进一步提高教育水平、提高劳动力质量上，使每一个受过教育或训练的劳动力能发挥更大的作用，从而提高劳动生产率，进一步推动新技术的采用和推广。这样，既可以适应经济增长的需要，又可以减少职位的空缺额。另一种可能性是：从长期看，待业人数和未来新达到就业年龄的人数之和可能大于预计的职位空缺额，那么调整时应当是提高与普及并重，既为国民经济培养有较高水平的专家，又使大量待业者有一技之长，便于找到合适的工作。这时，除了有必要进一步调整经济结构，以便增加职位空缺额以外，特别应注意发展中等技术和职业教育，给待业者以就业训练。还可以适当地延长在校学生的学习期限，一方面减少准备加入就业者行列的人数，另一方面提高他们的文化技术水平，以适应今后经济增长的需要。换句话说，与其让青年人在无技术、少知识的情况下待业，不如让他们多学习些知识与技能。</td>
		<td class="en">Developing education and spending more on it can help dovetail the workforce structure with a growing economy’s need for workers at different technical levels and in different fields of work. To achieve that end, we have got to adapt our educational structure to the changing economic growth rate and structure, and act on the long-term need of economic growth to readjust the categories of schools and the setup of academic programs, and to variegate the schooling terms. Long years of observation reveal two options in this regard. In the first option, when existing and prospective job-seekers are not outnumbered by anticipated unfilled job vacancies, the main thrust of our effort can be directed at further improving education and raising workforce quality, so that every worker that has been educated or trained can qualify for more demanding jobs, thereby enhancing labor productivity and further promoting the adoption of new technology. In this way, not only can the needs of economic growth be met, but the number of unfilled job vacancies can be curtailed as well. In the other option, when the total number of existing and prospective job-hunters outgrows the anticipated number of unfilled job vacancies, we can lay equal stress on improving and universalizing education, so that more high-caliber professionals can be cultivated for the national economy while legions of job-waiters are tooled with one kind of skill or another to qualify for suitable jobs. To achieve this end, apart from further restructuring the economy to increase job vacancies, attention should also be paid to developing secondary technical and vocational education so as to put more job-seekers through training. The school term for students can be lengthened so as to curtail the number of prospective job hunters and better prepare students culturally and technically for future economic growth needs. In other words, we would rather let our youngsters learn more knowledge and skill than keep them waiting for jobs when they are ill prepared in both skill and knowledge.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在上述两种可能性中，从我国具体情况来看，可以认为在相当长的时间内后一种可能性更大，所以我国教育事业的发展和教育结构的调整不能只着眼于提高，而忽略教育在解决“结构性”社会就业问题上的作用。</td>
		<td class="en">As things stand today, it is believed the second option is more workable for China for a long time to come. Thus, in education development and reform, we cannot go single-mindedly after improvement to the neglect of the role of education in tackling the “structural” employment problem.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这里，还应当注意到，教育结构调整不是一劳永逸的。一方面，经济增长本身要求教育部门输送大批有一定技术文化水平的、适应经济增长需要的劳动者，否则经济增长很难稳定地、持续地进行下去；另一方面，随着经济的增长，部门结构和地区结构总是处在不断变动之中，技术构成状况也会不断发生变化，这就要求教育结构相应地与之配合。一定的国民经济发展水平是与一定的教育结构相适应的，前者变动了，后者必须随之变动。这也是我国在制定长期人力资源规划时应当考虑的一个方面。</td>
		<td class="en">We should also remember that education reform cannot be accomplished overnight. For one thing, economic growth itself demands that our schools supply large numbers of well-educated and skilled workers who measure up to its needs. Failing this, stable and sustainable economic growth will be out of the question. For another, the economy’s ever-changing sectoral, regional and technological structures call for the adaptation of the education system. A certain level of national economic development is always consistent with a certain structure of education, with the latter changing in sync with the former. This fact should be considered when mapping out long-term national human resource plans.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以上是就“结构性”社会就业问题进行分析。我国当前的社会就业问题主要是“结构性”的，但并不仅仅是“结构性”的。应当承认，我国目前还存在着“个人职业选择性”的社会就业问题。在这种情况下，某些工作岗位空闲着，需要劳动者，但劳动者不是由于缺乏必要的文化和技术，而是出于个人对职业的选择，宁肯待业，而不愿去工作。这种类型的就业问题产生的原因是多方面的。但教育对于这一类就业问题的解决也能起到一定的作用，因为教育的任务不仅是传授文化技术知识。政治思想教育、革命人生观教育，对于我国的青年学生说来，也始终是不可缺少的。</td>
		<td class="en">So much for my analysis of the “structural” employment issue. The employment problems facing China today are “structural” in the main, but they do not stop merely at being “structural.” “Individual occupation selectivity” is another social employment issue for present-day China. When job openings are available, people can still choose to stay jobless. They do not lack the needed education and skill, but they make this choice out of occupational considerations. The causes of this employment problem are manifold, but education can still play a role in tackling it. This is because the mission of educators is not limited to teaching cultural knowledge and technical expertise. Character building and education in revolutionary values are essential to students in this country.</td></tr>
