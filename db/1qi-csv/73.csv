"钟摆","The Pendulum"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"“八十一号大街到站——请让他们下车。”穿蓝衣服的羊倌大叫道。","“Eighty-first street—let ’em out, please,” yelled the shepherd in blue."
"市民如一群绵羊一般乱哄哄地抢着下了车，接着另一群又急匆匆地挤了上去。叮—叮！曼哈顿高架铁道公司的牲口车隆隆驶过。约翰·珀金斯夹在下车的人群中，随波逐流地走下车站的楼梯。","A flock of citizen sheep scrambled out and another flock scrambled aboard.Ding-ding!The cattle cars of the Manhattan Elevated rattled away, and John Perkins drifted down the stairway of the station with the released flock."
"约翰慢慢地走向他的公寓。之所以慢慢地，是因为在他的日常生活的词典里，没有“也许”之类的词。对于一个结婚两年、住在公寓里的男人来说，没有什么惊喜在等候着他。约翰·珀金斯一边走着，一边带着郁郁寡欢的、被压制的、玩世不恭的心情，对自己预言着这单调的一天的结局早已注定了。","John walked slowly toward his flat.Slowly, because in the lexicon of his daily life there was no such word as “perhaps.”There are no surprises awaiting a man who has been married two years and lives in a flat.As he walked John Perkins prophesied to himself with gloomy and downtrodden cynicism the foregone conclusions of the monotonous day."
"凯蒂会在门口迎接他，并给他一个带着雪花膏和黄油硬糖味道的吻。他会脱掉外套，坐在一张像铺了碎石一样凹凸不平的长沙发上，读晚报上关于俄罗斯人和日本佬被致命的整行铸排机屠杀的新闻。","Katy would meet him at the door with a kiss flavored with cold cream and butter-scotch.He would remove his coat, sit upon a macadamized lounge and read, in the evening paper, of Russians and Japs slaughtered by the deadly linotype."
"晚饭准是炖肉、一份用保证不会使皮革裂开或损伤的佐料调制成的色拉、一份炖大黄和一瓶看到自己标签上的化学纯度证明会羞红了脸的草莓酱。晚饭后，凯蒂会给他看她的百衲被上的那块新补丁。补丁的料子是送冰人从他自己的活结领带尖上剪下来给她的。到了七点半，当楼上房间的胖子开始锻炼身体时，他们就会把报纸铺在家具上接掉下来的灰泥碎片。八点整时，在走廊对面的房间里，希基和穆尼组成的杂耍队（没人预约的）会受震颤性谵妄的轻微影响，妄想着哈默斯坦正带着一周五百美元的合约在追逐他们，于是他们开始推倒一把把椅子。接着，通风井对面的那位先生会坐在窗边拿出长笛；夜间泄漏的煤气总会悄悄溜到公路上作乐；送饭菜的小升降机会滑出手推车；看门人会再次把柴诺维茨基夫人的五个孩子赶过鸭绿江；那位穿香槟色鞋子的女子会带着她的斯凯岛长毛短腿狗轻快地走下楼梯，把她星期四用的名字粘在她的电铃和信箱上——然后，弗罗格摩尔公寓晚间的常规活动便拉开了序幕。","For dinner there would be pot roast, a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather, stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label.After dinner Katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four-in-hand.At half-past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises.Exactly at eight Hickey & Mooney, of the vaudeville team (unbooked) in the flat across the hall, would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that Hammerstein was pursuing them with a five-hundred-dollar-a-week contract.Then the gent at the window across the air-shaft would get out his flute; the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways; the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley; the janitor would drive Mrs. Zanowitski’s five children once more across the Yalu; the lady with the champagne shoes and the Skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her Thursday name over her bell and letter-box—and the evening routine of the Frogmore flats would be under way."
"约翰·珀金斯知道这些事一定会发生。他也知道，八点一刻，他就会鼓起勇气伸手去拿帽子，而他妻子则会怨声怨气地说一句：","John Perkins knew these things would happen.And he knew that at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat, and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone: "
"“喂，你要去哪儿，我想知道，约翰·珀金斯?”"," “Now, where are you going, I’d like to know, John Perkins?”"
"“我想去麦克洛斯基家，”他总是这样回答，“跟朋友们打一两局台球。”","“Thought I’d drop up to McCloskey’s,” he would answer, “and play a game or two of pool with the fellows.”"
"这是约翰·珀金斯近来养成的习惯。他总在十点或十一点钟回来。有时候，凯蒂已经睡着了，有时候她熬夜等着，准备从婚姻这条锻钢链子上再多熔化掉一点镀金，放在她愤怒的坩埚里。当爱神丘比特站在正义的被告栏后，面对受其所害的弗罗格摩尔公寓的住户们时，他将不得不回应这些事。","Of late such had been John Perkins’s habit.At ten or eleven he would return.Sometimes Katy would be asleep; sometimes waiting up, ready to melt in the crucible of her ire a little more gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony.For these things Cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the Frogmore flats."
"今天晚上，当约翰·珀金斯走到家门口时，却遭遇了单调生活里的一次巨变。凯蒂连同她那充满柔情和糖果味的吻都不在了。三个房间看起来都很凌乱，预示着不祥。她的东西乱糟糟的，到处都是。鞋子在地板中央，烫发钳、发结、和服式晨衣和化妆盒在梳妆台和椅子上杂乱地堆在一起——这可不是凯蒂的作风。看到梳子齿上有团她的棕色卷发，约翰的心直往下沉。她肯定是碰上什么异常紧急和烦恼的事了，因为她一贯把这些梳落的头发小心地放在壁炉台上那个蓝色小花瓶里，想着有一天可以做成一个令人垂涎的女用“发垫”。","To-night John Perkins encountered a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace when he reached his door.No Katy was there with her affectionate, confectionate kiss.The three rooms seemed in portentous disorder.All about lay her things in confusion.Shoes in the middle of the floor, curling tongs, hair bows, kimonos, powder box, jumbled together on dresser and chairs—this was not Katy’s way.With a sinking heart John saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth.Some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her, for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine “rat.”"
"煤气喷嘴上醒目地用线挂着一张折起来的纸。约翰一把抓住它。那是他妻子留的便条，上面是这样写着：","Hanging conspicuously to the gas jet by a string was a folded paper.John seized it.It was a note from his wife running thus:"
"“亲爱的约翰：我刚接到一封电报，说母亲病得很重。我要搭四点三十分的火车。山姆弟弟会在那边的火车站接我。冰盒里有冷羊肉。我希望不是她的扁桃腺炎症复发。付给送奶人五十美分。去年春天她病得厉害。别忘了写信跟公司说煤气表的事，你的袜子已洗好，放在最上面的抽屉里了。明天我会写信。匆此，凯蒂。”","“Dear John: I just had a telegram saying mother is very sick.I am going to take the 4.30 train.Brother Sam is going to meet me at the depot there.There is cold mutton in the ice box.I hope it isn’t her quinsy again.Pay the milkman 50 cents.She had it bad last spring.Don’t forget to write to the company about the gas meter, and your good socks are in the top drawer.I will write to-morrow.Hastily, KATY.”"
"他和凯蒂结婚两年，从来没有分开过一个晚上。约翰怔怔地把便条读了一遍又一遍。一成不变的生活被打乱了，这让他不知所措。","Never during their two years of matrimony had he and Katy been separated for a night.John read the note over and over in a dumbfounded way.Here was a break in a routine that had never varied, and it left him dazed."
"椅背上挂着那件她做饭时穿的红底黑点宽大长衣，如今却空空的，不成样子，让人觉得哀怜。匆忙中，她把平日穿的衣服扔得到处都是。一小纸袋她最爱吃的黄油硬糖放着，连绳子都没解开。一份日报杂乱地摊在地板上，被剪掉列车时刻表的地方留下了一个长方形的口子。房间里的一切都讲述着一种缺失，讲述着一个重要实体的逝去，讲述着它灵魂和生命的离去。约翰·珀金斯站在没有生命的余物中间，心里有一种奇怪的凄凉感。","There on the back of a chair hung, pathetically empty and formless, the red wrapper with black dots that she always wore while getting the meals.Her week-day clothes had been tossed here and there in her haste.A little paper bag of her favorite butter-scotch lay with its string yet unwound.A daily paper sprawled on the floor, gaping rectangularly where a railroad time-table had been clipped from it.Everything in the room spoke of a loss, of an essence gone, of its soul and life departed.John Perkins stood among the dead remains with a queer feeling of desolation in his heart."
"他开始整理房间，尽量收拾得整洁。他碰到她的衣服时，一种近似恐惧的震颤流遍他的全身。他从来没有想过，没有凯蒂的生活会是什么样子。她已经完全融入了他的生命中，就像是他呼吸的空气——必不可少，却几乎从不被察觉。如今，她没事先说一声就走了，消失了，完全不见了，就像她从来没存在过一般。当然，这只是几天的事，或者至多一两个星期，可是对他而言，这就仿佛死亡之手已把一根手指头指向了他平静、安稳的家。","He began to set the rooms tidy as well as he could.When he touched her clothes a thrill of something like terror went through him.He had never thought what existence would be without Katy.She had become so thoroughly annealed into his life that she was like the air he breathed—necessary but scarcely noticed.Now, without warning, she was gone, vanished, as completely absent as if she had never existed.Of course it would be only for a few days, or at most a week or two, but it seemed to him as if the very hand of death had pointed a finger at his secure and uneventful home."
"约翰慢吞吞地从冰盒里取出冷羊肉，煮好咖啡，坐下来一个人孤独地吃饭，与草莓酱瓶上那恬不知耻的纯度证明面面相觑。在被已然收回的诸多幸福中，那炖肉以及用棕黄色的、油亮的调料拌出的色拉的幻影，如今在他看来是那么鲜活生动。他的家被拆散了。一个扁桃腺发炎的丈母娘把他的家庭守护神抛到了九霄云外。约翰孤零零地吃完饭后，坐到窗前。","John dragged the cold mutton from the ice-box, made coffee and sat down to a lonely meal face to face with the strawberry marmalade’s shameless certificate of purity.Bright among withdrawn blessings now appeared to him the ghosts of pot roasts and the salad with tan polish dressing.His home was dismantled.A quinsied mother-in-law had knocked his lares and penates sky-high.After his solitary meal John sat at a front window."
"他不想抽烟。窗外的都市对他吼叫着，呼唤他加入自己愚蠢欢乐的舞蹈中去。夜晚是他的。毫无疑问，他可以出去,，他可以像那里的任何一个快乐的单身汉一样，无拘无束地信手拨弄狂欢的琴弦。只要他喜欢，他可以狂欢畅饮，可以到处游荡，可以恣意作乐，直到天亮；不会有愤怒的凯蒂在等他，忍受那盛着他欢乐残渣的高脚杯。只要他乐意，他可以在麦克洛斯基家和他那帮喧闹作乐的朋友打台球，直到曙光女神奥罗拉让电灯黯然失色。当弗罗格摩尔公寓已经让他生厌时，一直束缚着他的婚姻绳索松开了。凯蒂走了。","He did not care to smoke.Outside the city roared to him to come join in its dance of folly and pleasure.The night was his.He might go forth unquestioned and thrum the strings of jollity as free as any gay bachelor there.He might carouse and wander and have his fling until dawn if he liked; and there would be no wrathful Katy waiting for him, bearing the chalice that held the dregs of his joy.He might play pool at McCloskey’s with his roistering friends until Aurora dimmed the electric bulbs if he chose.The hymeneal strings that had curbed him always when the Frogmore flats had palled upon him were loosened.Katy was gone."
"约翰·珀金斯不习惯分析自己的情感。但是，当他坐在那没有凯蒂的、宽十英尺、长十二英尺的客厅里的时候，他准确无误地发现了自己不安的基调。现在他知道凯蒂对自己的幸福是不可或缺的。他对她的情感，由于日复一日枯燥的家庭生活而被麻痹得没有知觉了，如今却被她的离去猛地唤醒了。谚语、布道和寓言——抑或其他同样华丽而又真实的言辞里——不是三番五次地告诫过我们，在歌喉甜美的鸟儿飞走前，我们从来不珍惜音乐吗？","John Perkins was not accustomed to analyzing his emotions.But as he sat in his Katy-bereft 10×12 parlor he hit unerringly upon the keynote of his discomfort.He knew now that Katy was necessary to his happiness.His feeling for her, lulled into unconsciousness by the dull round of domesticity, had been sharply stirred by the loss of her presence.Has it not been dinned into us by proverb and sermon and fable that we never prize the music till the sweet-voiced bird has flown—or in other no less florid and true utterances?"
"“我是一个彻头彻尾的傻瓜，”约翰·珀金斯思忖道，“我一直那样对待凯蒂。每天晚上都出去打台球，和那些家伙闲逛，却没有呆在家里陪她。可怜的姑娘独自一人，什么消遣也没有，而我还那样做！约翰·珀金斯，你真是糟糕透了。我要补偿这个小姑娘。我要带她出去，让她见识一些娱乐活动。从此刻起，我要和麦克洛斯基那帮人断绝往来。”","“I’m a double-dyed dub,” mused John Perkins, “the way I’ve been treating Katy.Off every night playing pool and bumming with the boys instead of staying home with her.The poor girl here all alone with nothing to amuse her, and me acting that way!John Perkins, you’re the worst kind of a shine.I’m going to make it up for the little girl.I’ll take her out and let her see some amusement.And I’ll cut out the McCloskey gang right from this minute.”"
"是的，外面的都市在大声召唤约翰·珀金斯加入嘲笑与非难之神莫摩斯的队列中去跳舞。在麦克洛斯基家，那些家伙们正悠闲地把台球打进球袋，消磨时光，夜夜如此。但不管是享乐之路，还是咔嗒作响的球杆，都不能吸引失去妻子的珀金斯那懊悔的灵魂。那原属于他的东西从他的身边被带走了，他曾经对其轻视过，甚至有些鄙视，如今他却需要它。往前追溯，有个叫亚当的男人曾被小天使们从果园里赶了出来，懊悔的珀金斯能在他身上找到自己的源头。","Yes, there was the city roaring outside for John Perkins to come dance in the train of Momus.And at McCloskey’s the boys were knocking the balls idly into the pockets against the hour for the nightly game.But no primrose way nor clicking cue could woo the remorseful soul of Perkins the bereft.The thing that was his, lightly held and half scorned, had been taken away from him, and he wanted it.Backward to a certain man named Adam, whom the cherubim bounced from the orchard, could Perkins, the remorseful, trace his descent."
"在约翰·珀金斯右手边有把椅子。椅背上放着凯蒂的蓝色衬衣式连衣裙。它还保留着几分她身材曲线的影子。袖子中间部分有几个细微的、独特的皱褶，那都是凯蒂为了他的舒适和快乐挥动手臂劳动留下的。它散发着一股清雅而又沁人心脾的圆叶风铃草的香气。约翰拿起它，久久地、严肃地看着这件毫无回应的紧捻纱罗织裙。凯蒂从来都不会毫无回应。泪水——没错，就是泪水——涌上了约翰·珀金斯的双眼。当她回来的时候，情形会有所不同。他一定会补偿自己所有的疏忽。没有她，生活算什么？","Near the right hand of John Perkins stood a chair.On the back of it stood Katy’s blue shirtwaist.It still retained something of her contour.Midway of the sleeves were fine, individual wrinkles made by the movements of her arms in working for his comfort and pleasure.A delicate but impelling odor of bluebells came from it.John took it and looked long and soberly at the unresponsive grenadine.Katy had never been unresponsive.Tears:—yes, tears—came into John Perkins’s eyes.When she came back things would be different.He would make up for all his neglect.What was life without her?"
"门开了。凯蒂提着一个小手提包走了进来。约翰傻傻地盯着她。","The door opened.Katy walked in carrying a little hand satchel.John stared at her stupidly."
"“哎！真高兴回来了，”凯蒂说，“妈病得不算重。山姆在火车站，说她只发作了一会儿，他们打完电报不久，她就好了。所以我就搭下一班火车回来了。我好想喝杯咖啡。”","“My! I’m glad to get back,” said Katy.“Ma wasn’t sick to amount to anything.Sam was at the depot, and said she just had a little spell, and got all right soon after they telegraphed.So I took the next train back.I’m just dying for a cup of coffee.”"
"当弗罗格摩尔公寓三楼前面的大钟又嗡嗡地恢复正常轨道时，没人听见嵌齿轮发出的咔嗒声和格格声。传动带滑动了，弹簧被触动了，齿轮被调好了，轮子又在旧轨道里运转开了。","Nobody heard the click and rattle of the cog-wheels as the third-floor front of the Frogmore flats buzzed its machinery back into the Order of Things.A band slipped, a spring was touched, the gear was adjusted and the wheels revolve in their old orbit."
"约翰·珀金斯看了看这个时钟。是八点一刻。他伸手拿起帽子，朝门口走去。","John Perkins looked at the clock.It was 8.15.He reached for his hat and walked to the door."
"“喂，你要去哪儿，我想知道，约翰·珀金斯?” 凯蒂怨声怨气地问。","“Now, where are you going, I’d like to know, John Perkins?” asked Katy, in a querulous tone."
"“我打算去麦克洛斯基家，”约翰说，“跟伙计们打一两局台球。”","“Thought I’d drop up to McCloskey’s,” said John, “and play a game or two of pool with the fellows.”"
