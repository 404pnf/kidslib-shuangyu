"迟来的旅客","The Belated Travellers"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文","by Washington Irving"
"在一个傍晚时分，一辆骡车缓慢吃力地爬上亚平宁山脉的一个隘口。通过其中一个最荒凉的隘道远远望去，一个小小的村庄坐落在岩石顶上，透过山上浓密的树林，隐约可见一个修道院的几座白塔。这辆车式样古老，造得很笨重。剥落褪色的装饰诉说着它昔日的华丽，但是破旧的弹簧和吱嘎作响的车轴泄露了它如今的衰败。车里坐着一位高挑、瘦削的老绅士，他身穿军旅服，头戴一顶镶有皮边的军便帽。帽子下露出一些灰白头发，说明他的战斗生涯已经结束了。他身边坐着一个18岁的美丽女孩。她面色苍白，穿的好像是北方或者是波兰服装。一个仆人坐在车的前面，看样子是个顽固暴躁的人，脸上有一条刀疤，鼻子下长着两撇褐黄色的胡子，又短又硬，看上去老军人的气概十足。","It was late one evening that a carriage, drawn by mules, slowly toiled its way up one of the passes of the Apennines.It was through one of the wildest defiles, where a hamlet occurred only at distant intervals, perched on the summit of some rocky height, or the white towers of a convent peeped out from among the thick mountain foliage.The carriage was of ancient and ponderous construction.Its faded embellishments spoke of former splendour, but its crazy springs and axletrees creaked out the tale of present decline.Within was seated a tall, thin old gentleman, in a kind of military travelling dress, and a foraging cap trimmed with fur, though the grey locks which stole from under it hinted that his fighting days were over.Beside him was a pale, beautiful girl of eighteen, dressed in something of a northern or Polish costume.One servant was seated in front, a rusty, crusty-looking fellow, with a scar across his face; an orange@tawny schnur@bart, or pair of mustachios, bristling from under his nose, and altogether the air of an old soldier."
"事实上，这是一辆波兰贵族的马车，是皇族的遗物。主人原属皇室，一度过着奢华的生活，几乎比得上东方王公的华丽，但是波兰灭亡后，皇室就变得败落贫困了。这位伯爵，像其他许多慷慨激昂之士一样，犯了爱国罪，在某种程度上，是一个被放逐国外的流亡者。为了女儿的教育，他曾在意大利几个一流城市居住。在女儿身上，他倾注了全部的心思和欢乐。他曾带着女儿到上流社会应酬，她的美貌和才艺使她赢得了许多钦慕者。如果她不是一个贫穷、没落的波兰贵族的女儿，会有许多人争相向她求婚的。可是，忽然间她变得娇弱起来，精神也一日不如一日。她的快乐随着脸颊上的红润颜色一并消失了。她变得沉默寡言，弱不禁风。老伯爵看出了这种变化，非常担忧。“我们必须改变空气和环境。”他说。几天之后，这辆古老的家庭马车就在亚平宁群山之中辘辘地转动了。","It was, in fact, the equipage of a Polish nobleman; a wreck of one of those princely families which had lived with almost Oriental magnificence, but had been broken down and impoverished by the disasters of Poland.The Count, like many other generous spirits, had been found guilty of the crime of patriotism, and was, in a manner, an exile from his country.He had resided for some time in the first cities of Italy for the education of his daughter, in whom all his cares and pleasures were now centred.He had taken her into society, where her beauty and her accomplishments had gained her many admirers; and had she not been the daughter of a poor broken-down Polish nobleman, it is more than probable that many would have contended for her hand.Suddenly, however, her health had become delicate and drooping; her gaiety fled with the roses of her cheek, and she sank into silence and debility.The old count saw the change with the solicitude of a parent.“We must try a change of air and scene,” said he; and in a few days the old family carriage was rumbling among the Apennines."
"老兵卡斯珀是他们唯一的随从，他生于伯爵家，一直做家里的管家，现在已经变得苍老了。他跟随主人历经兴衰。打仗时，他与主人并肩而战；主人在战斗中倒下时，他紧护其身。因为保护主人，他脸上受了刀伤，致使容貌变得有些可怕。他现在是伯爵的贴身仆人和管家，负责伯爵的伙食和其他杂活。唯一能分享卡斯珀对主人的一片忠心的人是年轻的小姐，他看着她长大。小姐在孩提时，他拉着她的手走路。现在，他像一个父亲一样喜欢小姐；不仅如此，只要于她有益，他都会像父亲一样在各种事情上直率地提点她；看见小姐被人注视和赞美，他像一个父亲一样感到光荣。","Their only attendant was the veteran Caspar, who had been born in the family, and grown rusty in its service.He had followed his master in all his fortunes; had fought by his side; had stood over him when fallen in battle; and had received, in his defence, the sabre-cut which added such grimness to his countenance.He was now his valet, his steward, his butler, his factotum.The only being that rivalled his master in his affections was his youthful mistress; she had grown up under his eye.He had led her by the hand when she was a child, and he now looked upon her with the fondness of a parent; nay, he even took the freedom of a parent in giving his blunt opinion on all matters which he thought were for her good; and felt a parent’s vanity in seeing her gazed at and admired."
"他们沿着湍急的溪流穿过一个个狭窄的山谷，走了很长一段时间，夜幕也渐渐落下。周遭的景色荒凉而险恶。道路上乱石丛生，岩石边成群的白色山羊吃着草，不时地俯视着旅客。他们还得走上十里至十五里的路才能到达前面的村庄。骡夫皮特罗是个老酒鬼，在上一个休息的地方喝了超出常量的酒，精神亢奋，对着他的几头骡子一会儿唱歌一会儿说话，让骡子像蜗牛一样痛苦地慢慢行走，毫不理会伯爵频频的苦求和卡斯珀的咒骂。","The evening was thickening: they had been for some time passing through narrow gorges of the mountains, along the edge of a tumbling stream.The scenery was lonely and savage.The rocks often beetled over the road, with flocks of white goats browsing on their brinks, and gazing down upon the travellers.They had between two and three leagues yet to go before they could reach any village; yet the muleteer, Pietro, a tippling old fellow, who had refreshed himself at the last haltingplace with a more than ordinary quantity of wine, sat singing and talking alternately to his mules, and suffering them to lag on at a snail’s pace, in spite of the frequent entreaties of the Count and maledictions of Caspar."
"群山间的云层开始聚集，卷成一团一团，遮住山峰。这片高地的空气也变得潮湿、寒冷。伯爵因担心女儿受寒而没了平时的耐心。他从车里探出身子，对着老皮特罗愤怒地吼道：","The clouds began to roll in heavy masses among the mountains, shrouding their summits from the view.The air of these heights, too, was damp and chilly.The Count’s solicitude on his daughter’s account overcame his usual patience.He leaned from the carriage, and called to old Pietro in an angry tone."
"“向前赶啊！”伯爵叫道，“我们半夜也到不了旅店。”“先生，那边就是旅店。”骡夫说。“哪儿？”伯爵问道。“就在那边！”皮特罗指着前面大约四分之一里格远的几座孤零零的房子。“就在那种地方吗？——看起来不像旅店，倒像一堆废墟。我原以为我们能到一个村子里舒舒服服地过夜。”","“Forward !” said he.“It will be midnight before we arrive at our inn.”—“Yonder it is, signor,” said the muleteer.—“Where?” demanded the Count.—“Yonder,” said Pietro, pointing to a desolate pile of building about a quarter of a league distant.—“That the place?—why, it looks more like a ruin than an inn.I thought we were to put up for the night at a comfortable village.”"
"这时候，皮特罗便开始埋怨地喊叫，像所有懈怠的骡夫常挂在嘴边的话一样。“这样的路！这样的山！可怜的牲口走乏了，腿软了，它们要是倒下来，就永远到不了村庄了。先生您觉得还有什么旅店比更好！一座完美的城堡！一座宫殿！热情的人们！上好的伙食！舒服的床铺！先生可以在那儿吃得美美的，睡得甜甜的，像王子一样！”伯爵轻易就被说服了，因为他迫切地想让女儿避开夜间的寒气。不一会儿，这辆古老的马车就吱吱嘎嘎、叮叮当当地驶进了旅店的大门。这所房子与骡夫的描述确实有些相符。房子很大，够得上一座城堡或宫殿，结构结实，不过式样简单，接近粗陋，有许多废弃的房间。事实上，这所房子曾经是一位意大利亲王打猎时居住的别墅。房子里足够宽敞。这所房子的附属房足够驻扎一支小军队。看来这个荒凉大宅子里的住户，人口很少。他们到店的时候，出来迎接的人满脸污垢，神色阴沉。然而，他们都认识老皮特罗，他们把边唱边说，几乎是高声叫喊着把老皮特罗迎进门。","Here Pietro uttered a string of piteous exclamations and ejaculations, such as are ever at the tip of the tongue of a delinquent muleteer.“Such roads! and such mountains! and then his poor animals were way-worn, and leg-weary; they would fall lame; they would never be able to reach the village.And then what could his Eccellenza wish for better than the inn; a perfect castello—a palazza—and such people!—and such a larder!—and such beds! His Eccellenza might fare as sumptuously and sleep as soundly there as a prince!” The Count was easily persuaded, for he was anxious to get his daughter out of the night air; so in a little while the old carriage rattled and jingled into the great gateway of the inn.The building did certainly in some measure answer to the muleteer’s description.It was large enough for either castle or palazza; built in a strong, but simple and almost rude style; with a great quantity of waste room.It had, in fact, been, in former times, a hunting-seat for one of the Italian princes.There was space enough within its walls and in its out-buildings to have accommodated a little army.A scanty household seemed now to be people in this dreary mansion.The faces that presented themselves on the arrival of the travellers were begrimed with dirt, and scowling in their expression.They all knew old Pietro, however, and gave him a welcome as he entered, singing and talking, and almost whooping, into the gateway."
"旅店的女主人亲自招呼伯爵和他的女儿，领着他们看房间。女店主领着他们穿过一条阴暗的长廊，然后又穿过一些互通的内室，内室里有高高的天花板，巨大的横梁横穿而过。然而，房间里的东西都很又脏又旧。潮湿的墙壁上光秃秃的，只是到处都挂着些名画，那些画大得可以挂在教堂里，画面黑得什么也看不清了。","The hostess of the inn waited herself on the Count and his daughter, to show them the apartments.They were conducted through a long gloomy corridor, and then through a suite of chambers opening into each other, with lofty ceilings, and great beams extending across them.Everything, however, had a wretched, squalid look.The walls were damp and bare, excepting that here and there hung some great painting, large enough for a chapel, and blackened out of all distinctness."
"他们挑了两个房间，其中一间在另一间的里面，里间那间给女儿住。床很大，却变了形。老皮特罗曾夸赞床铺舒适，但是仔细一看，他们发现床垫里塞的都是麻纤，一块一块地都结成了团。伯爵耸耸肩，但也别无选择。房间里寒气入骨，他们很高兴回到一个普通的房间，或者是大厅，那里有一个大墙洞，里面烧着火，被误称为壁炉。","They chose two bed-rooms, one within another; the inner one for the daughter.The bedsteads were massive and misshapen; but on examining the beds, so vaunted by old Pietro, they found them stuffed with fibres of hemp, knotted in great lumps.The Count shrugged his shoulders, but there was no choice left.The chilliness of the apartments crept to their bones; and they were glad to return to a common chamber, or kind of hall, where there was a fire burning in a huge cavern, miscalled a chimney."
"他们扔进去许多绿树枝，壁炉里冒出一阵阵的浓烟。这间客厅与大宅其他部分的风格很相称。地面做了铺设，也很脏。一张又大又重的橡木桌子，稳稳地立在中间。","A quantity of green wood had just been thrown on, which puffed out volumes of smoke.The room corresponded to the rest of the mansion.The floor was paved and dirty.A great oaken table stood in the centre, immoveable from its size and weight."
"只有女店主的穿戴和整个大宅的寒酸气迥然不同。当然，她是个邋遢的女人，穿得随随便便，还脏兮兮的，可是衣服料子却挺贵重。她手上戴着好几个贵重的戒指，耳朵上戴着宝石，脖子上挂着一串大珍珠项链，链子上坠着一个闪闪发光的耶稣受难像。女店主风韵犹存，但是她脸上的某些表情，让伯爵小姐格外厌恶。她大献殷勤，卑躬屈膝地伺候他们，后来因为要去操办晚餐，她叫一个黝黑的、绷着脸的女仆来伺候他们，伯爵和他的女儿才松了一口气。","The only thing that contradicted this prevalent air of indigence was the dress of the hostess.She was a slattern, of course; yet her garments, though dirty and negligent, were of costly materials.She wore several rings of great value on her fingers, and jewels in her ears, and round her neck was a string of large pearls, to which was attached a sparkling crucifix.She had the remains of beauty; yet there was something in the expression of her countenance that inspired the young lady with singular aversion.She was officious and obsequious in her attentions, and both the Count and his daughter were relieved when she consigned them to the care of a dark, sullen-looking servant-maid, and went off to superintend the supper."
"卡斯珀对骡夫的行为很生气，不管他是有意还是无意，都不该把主人和小姐带到这样的地方来。他指着骡夫的胡子郑重地说，一旦他们平安离开山区，他就要向这个老无赖报仇。他一直跟那个绷着脸的女仆争吵，却只让那个女仆的表情更加凶恶，她的眼睛在又浓又黑的眉毛下，凶狠地看着旅客们。","Caspar was indignant at the muleteer for having, either through negligence or design, subjected his master and mistress to such quarters; and vowed by his mustachios to have revenge on the old varlet the moment they were safe out from among the mountains.He kept up a continual quarrel with the sulky servant-maid, which only served to increase the sinister expression with which she regarded the travellers, from under her strong dark eyebrows."
"至于伯爵，他脾气很好，是个随遇而安的旅客。也许是真正的灾难把他的脾气磨平了，那些正值春风得意的人感到痛苦难忍的事，在他看来都是可以忍受的小事。他把一把破旧的大靠椅拖到火炉边给他女儿，又拖了一把给自己；然后拿起一把巨大的火钳，想翻翻炉里的木头让火旺起来。然而，他这一折腾反而弄出一阵浓烟，几乎让这位老绅士失去耐心。他向后退了退，回头看了看他那娇弱的女儿，又看了看这间阴郁、肮脏的客厅，耸耸肩，又去搅动炉火了。","As to the Count, he was a good-humoured, passive traveller.Perhaps real misfortunes had subdued his spirit, and rendered him tolerant of many of those petty evils which make prosperous men miserable.He drew a large broken arm-chair to the fireside for his daughter, and another for himself, and seizing an enormous pair of tongs, endeavoured to re-arrange the wood so as to produce a blaze.His efforts, however, were only repaid by thicker puffs of smoke, which almost overcame the good gentleman’s patience.He would draw back, cast a look upon his delicate daughter, then upon the cheerless, squalid apartment, and shrugging his shoulders, would give a fresh stir to the fire."
"一家不舒服的旅店有许多让人痛苦的事，但最令人难以忍受的是始终绷着脸的女仆。这位好脾气的伯爵宁愿默默地忍受一会儿烟熏，也不愿跟那个愁眉苦脸的女仆说。可是后来他不得不求那个女仆去取些干燥的柴火来。","Of all the miseries of a comfortless inn, however, there is none greater than sulky attendance: the good Count for some time bore the smoke in silence, rather than address himself to the scowling servantmaid.At length he was compelled to beg for drier firewood."
"女仆低声抱怨着去了。不一会儿，她手里抱着干柴，匆匆走进来，但是不小心脚下一滑跌倒了，头磕在椅子角上，鬓角伤得很重。这一碰使她昏迷了一会儿，伤口流了许多血。当她醒过来时，发现伯爵的女儿正在用自己的手帕给她包扎伤口。这是任何一个有正常感情的女人都会做的事，但也许是正俯身照顾她的可爱女孩的容貌，或者是说话的声调，触动了女仆的心。从没有这样的人照顾过她。就这样，女仆被深深地感动了。她抓起这位波兰小姐娇嫩的手，放在嘴边热烈地吻着：","The woman retired muttering.On reentering the room hastily, with an armful of fagots, her foot slipped; she fell, and striking her head against the corner of a chair, cut her temple severely.The blow stunned her for a time, and the wound bled profusely.When she recovered, she found the Count’s daughter administering to her wound, and binding it up with her own handkerchief.It was such an attention as any woman of ordinary feeling would have yielded; but perhaps there was something in the appearance of the lovely being who bent over her, or in the tones of her voice, that touched the heart of the woman, unused to be ministered to by such hands.Certain it is, she was strongly affected.She caught the delicate hand of the Polonaise, and pressed it fervently to her lips:"
"“小姐，愿圣弗兰西斯保佑你!”她说。","“May San Francesco watch over you, signora!” exclaimed she."
"一批新到的旅客打破了旅店的寂静。来的是西班牙王爵夫人和她难以计数的随从。院子里一片喧闹，屋子里也忙忙碌碌的。女店主忙着招待显赫的贵宾，而穷伯爵和他的女儿，以及他们的晚餐在这个时候就被忘掉了。老兵卡斯珀用波兰话喃喃谩骂，足以使一个意大利人感到痛苦，却不能使女店主相信他的主人和小姐比全体西班牙王族更高贵。","A new arrival broke the stillness of the inn.It was a Spanish princess with a numerous retinue.The court-yard was in an uproar; the house in a bustle; the landlady hurried to attend such distinguished guests; and the poor Count and his daughter, and their supper, were for the moment forgotten.The veteran Caspar muttered Polish maledictions enough to agonize an Italian ear; but it was impossible to convince the hostess of the superiority of his old master and young mistress to the whole nobility of Spain."
"院子里的喧闹声吸引了伯爵的女儿，她走到窗口，新到的客人正好下车。一个年轻的骑士从马车上跳下来，扶着王爵夫人下车。夫人是个瘦小枯干的老太太，脸色像羊皮纸一样，双眼却乌黑有神。她衣着华丽阔气，走路支着一根与身齐高的金头手杖。那个年轻人身材修长，举止文雅。伯爵的女儿一看到那个年轻人就惊得连连后退，尽管窗架很深，外面的人不会看到她。她深深地叹了一声，关上窗户。我也不明白她为什么叹气。也许是由于王爵夫人华丽的马车和她父亲摇摇晃晃的旧马车停在一起，产生对比的缘故。不论是什么理由，这个年轻的女子叹息着关上了窗门。她坐回椅子里。娇嫩的身子一阵轻颤，胳膊支在椅子的扶手上，手掌托着苍白的脸，忧伤地望着炉火。","The noise of the arrival had attracted the daughter to the window just as the new comers had alighted.A young cavalier sprang out of the carriage, and handed out the Princess.The latter was a little shrivelled old lady, with a face of parchment, and a sparkling black eye; she was richly and gaily dressed, and walked with the assistance of a gold-headed cane as high as herself.The young man was tall and elegantly formed.The Count’s daughter shrank back at sight of him, though the deep frame of the window screened her from observation.She gave a heavy sigh as she closed the casement.What that sigh meant I cannot say.Perhaps it was at the contrast between the splendid equipage of the Princess, and the crazy, rheumatic-looking old vehicle of her father, which stood hard by.Whatever might be the reason, the young lady closed the casement with a sigh.She returned to her chair;—a slight shivering passed over her delicate frame; she leaned her elbow on the arm of the chair; rested her pale cheek in the palm of her hand, and looked mournfully into the fire."
"伯爵觉得她的脸色比平常更苍白。“我的孩子，你哪里不舒服吗？”他问。“没事，亲爱的爸爸！”她说着拉起了父亲的手，抬头微笑着看着他。只是，她说话时，涌上眼睛的泪珠出卖了她，她扭头转向别处。“窗口进来的风让你受凉了，”伯爵疼爱地说，“只要好好休息一晚就会好的。”","The Count thought she appeared paler than usual.—“Does anything ail thee, my child?” said he.—“Nothing, dear father!” replied she, laying her hand within his, and looking up smiling in his face; but as she said so, a treacherous tear rose suddenly to her eye, and she turned away her head.—“The air of the window has chilled thee,” said the Count, fondly, “but a good night’s rest will make all well again.”"
"晚餐的桌子终于放置好了，正要上餐时，女店主进来了，以她一贯的谄媚，表示抱歉说要把新旅客带到客厅来，因为晚上天气寒冷，别的房间没有火炉。她的道歉话还没说完，王爵夫人就挽着那个文雅的青年进来了。","The supper-table was at length laid, and the supper about to be served, when the hostess appeared, with her usual obsequiousness, apologizing for showing in the new comers; but the night air was cold, and there was no other chamber in the inn with a fire in it.She had scarcely made the apology when the Princess entered, leaning on the arm of the elegant young man."
"伯爵立刻认出了她，他在罗马和那不勒斯的社交场合经常见到她。实际上，她经常邀请伯爵参加她的谈话会。他也知道那个年轻的骑士是王爵夫人的侄子和继承人，交际场中人人都盛赞他的才能和前程。有一次，他父女二人和这个青年同时去探望住在那不勒斯附近别墅的一个贵族。听说他新近已和一个富有的西班牙女继承人订婚。","The Count immediately recognized her for a lady whom he had met frequently in society both at Rome and Naples; and at whose conversaziones, in fact, he had constantly been invited.The cavalier, too, was her nephew and heir, who had been greatly admired in the gay circles both for his merits and prospects, and who had once been on a visit at the same time with his daughter and himself at the villa of a nobleman near Naples.Report had recently affianced him to a rich Spanish heiress."
"伯爵和王爵夫人对这次相会都很高兴。伯爵是一个老派绅士，极其多礼。王爵夫人年轻时是个美女，一生都生活在上流社会，喜欢被关注。","The meeting was agreeable to both the Count and the Princess.The former was a gentleman of the old school, courteous in the extreme; the Princess had been a belle in her youth, and a woman of fashion all her life, and liked to be attended to."
"那个年轻人走到伯爵女儿面前，说了几句恭维的话，可是神态很不自然，嘴里的话到后来也含糊不清了。而小姐只是鞠了一躬，并不抬头看他，嘴唇在动，却说不出一个字来，她又坐回椅子里，盯着炉火，脸上的表情变化万千。","The young man approached the daughter, and began something of a complimentary observation: but his manner was embarrassed, and his compliment ended in an indistinct murmur, while the daughter bowed without looking up, moved her lips without articulating a word, and sank again into her chair, where she sat gazing into the fire, with a thousand varying expressions passing over her countenance."
"两个老人这时正忙着彼此殷勤地问候，并没有注意到这两位年轻人问候时的异常。店里安排他们两家共进晚餐，因为王爵夫人带着私人厨师，所以不一会儿，一顿上好的饭菜就热气腾腾地摆上了桌。不仅如此，王爵夫人还从马车里拿出了美酒和精致的甜点。她是一个资深美食家，好奇地想尝遍整个世界的美食。其实，她是一个活泼的小老太太，也是一个放荡的女人，也是一个虔诚的教徒。而这次，她是专程到洛雷托圣地来的，要在圣地奉上昂贵的财物，为她一生的风流和过失赎罪。简单的朝圣者带着小袋，拐杖和鸟蛤壳，而她不同，诚然是一个奢侈的忏悔者。但我们也没有理由指望上流社会的人能自我克制，而且不可否认的是，她带去献给圣母的贵重的耶稣受难像，黄金器皿和珠宝饰物是很有效力的。","This singular greeting of the young people was not perceived by the old ones, who were occupied at the time with their own courteous salutations.It was arranged that they should sup together; and as the Princess travelled with her own cook, a very tolerable supper soon smoked upon the board; this, too, was assisted by choice wines, and liqueurs, and delicate confitures brought from one of her carriages; for she was a veteran epicure, and curious in her relish for the good things of this world.She was, in fact, a vivacious little old lady, who mingled the woman of dissipation with the devotee.She was actually on her way to Loretto, to expiate a long life of gallantries and peccadilloes by a rich offering at the holy shrine.She was, to be sure, rather a luxurious penitent, and a contrast to the primitive pilgrims, with scrip, and staff, and cockleshell; but then it would be unreasonable to expect such selfdenial from people of fashion; and there was not a doubt of the ample efficacy of the rich crucifixes, and golden vessels, and jewelled ornaments, which she was bearing to the treasury of the Blessed Virgin."
"吃晚饭的时候，伯爵和王爵夫人说了许多话，谈论他们从前共同涉足的场合和社交界。然而，他们没有注意到，只有他们两个人在谈话，两个年轻人却拘谨地一言不发。尽管王爵夫人不断客气地劝小姐尝一尝精致的美食，小姐还是什么都没吃。伯爵摇着头，说：“她今晚身体不太舒服。你们的马车刚到的时候，她正从窗口往外看，我还以为她会晕倒。”小姐的脸一下子变得通红，但是她把头埋在盘子里，用头发挡住脸。","The Princess and the Count chatted much during supper about the scenes and society in which they had mingled, and did not notice that they had all the conversation to themselves: the young people were silent and constrained.The daughter ate nothing, in spite of the politeness of the Princess, who continually pressed her to taste of one or other of the delicacies.The Count shook his head:—“She is not well this evening,” said he.“I thought she would have fainted just now as she was looking out of the window at your carriage on its arrival.” A crimson glow flushed to the very temples of the daughter; but she leaned over her plate, and her tresses cast a shade over her countenance."
"晚餐结束后，他们把椅子拖到大火炉旁边。没了熊熊的火焰和呛人的浓烟，只剩下一堆发光的炭火，散出令人舒服的暖气。一把从伯爵的马车取出来的吉他，靠在墙边，王爵夫人看见了，便问道：“在我们各自就寝之前，是否可以奏点音乐？”","When supper was over, they drew their chairs about the great fireplace.The flame and smoke had subsided, and a heap of glowing embers diffused a grateful warmth.A guitar, which had been brought from the Count’s carriage, leaned against the wall; the Princess perceived it: “Can we not have a little music before parting for the night?” demanded she."
"伯爵向来以他女儿的音乐才艺为傲，便要他女儿弹吉他。那青年非常有礼地拿起吉他送到美丽的音乐家面前，不过态度很不自然。小姐本想拒绝，但却心慌意乱地接受了。的确，她神经紧张得说不出推辞的话来。她一只手颤抖着抱着吉他，在弹了一点前奏曲后，她自弹自唱了几只波兰歌曲。她父亲目光发亮地坐在那里盯着女儿。甚至连粗犷的卡斯珀也呆在房间里不肯离去，一方面是因为他喜欢听本国的音乐，但主要的是他为这位音乐家感到骄傲。确实，那悦耳的音调，精妙的指法足以使最挑剔的耳朵着迷。王爵夫人一面点头一面用手打着拍子，尽管很不合拍。而她的侄子坐在那儿望着对面墙上的一张黑色的画，沉浸在深深的冥想之中。","The Count was proud of his daughter’s accomplishment, and joined in the request.The young man made an effort of politeness, and taking up the guitar presented it, though in an embarrassed manner, to the fair musician.She would have declined it, but was too much confused to do so; indeed, she was so nervous and agitated, that she dared not trust her voice to make an excuse.She touched the instrument with a faltering hand, and, after preluding a little, accompanied herself in several Polish airs.Her father’s eyes glistened as he sat gazing on her.Even the crusty Caspar lingered in the room, partly through a fondness for the music of his native country, but chiefly through his pride in the musician.Indeed, the melody of the voice, and the delicacy of the touch, were enough to have charmed more fastidious ears.The little Princess nodded her head and tapped her hand to the music, though exceedingly out of time; while the nephew sat buried in profound contemplation of a black picture on the opposite wall."
"“现在，”伯爵疼爱地拍拍女儿的脸说，“再奏一支你拿手的曲子吧。让王爵夫人听听你最喜欢的西班牙小曲。你想象不到，”他又对王爵夫人说，“虽然她是一个忧郁的姑娘，而且近来又疏于练习，但她对你们的语言非常精通。”","“And now,” said the Count, patting her cheek fondly, “one more fovour.Let the Princess hear that little Spanish air you were so fond of.You can’t think,” added he, “what a proficiency she made in your language, though she has been a sad girl and neglected it of late.”"
"女儿苍白的脸一下子又红了起来，她迟疑了一会儿，喃喃地说了些什么，但还是竭力让自己镇静下来，。那是一个浪漫的西班牙歌曲，有甜美的爱情，也有忧伤。弹奏第一节时她投入了极大的感情，那颤抖、感伤的声调沁人心扉。但是她没有弹下去，乐声渐弱，她的嘴唇颤抖，泣不成声。","The colour flushed the pale cheek of the daughter; she hesitated, murmured something; but with sudden effort collected herself, struck the guitar boldly, and began.It was a Spanish romance, with something of love and melancholy in it.She gave the first stanza with great expression, for the tremulous, melting tones of her voice went to the heart; but her articulation failed, her lip quivered, the song died away, and she burst into tears."
"伯爵温柔地抱住她。“你不舒服，我的孩子，”他说，“我太难为你了。回房休息吧，愿上帝保佑你！”她对众人鞠了一躬，没有抬头就溜出了房间。","The Count folded her tenderly in his arms.“Thou art not well, my child,” said he, “and I am tasking thee cruelly.Retire to thy chamber, and God bless thee!” She bowed to the company without raising her eyes, and glided out of the room."
"门关了后，伯爵摇了摇头。他说：“这孩子有什么心事，我猜不出来。近来她的身体和精神都垮了。她向来是一朵娇嫩的花，我千辛万苦地养育她。原谅一个父亲的傻气吧，”他继续说，“我经历了家族中的许多患难，现在我只有这个可怜的姑娘了，她一向很活泼的——”“也许她在恋爱！”矮小的王爵夫人机灵地点着头说。“不可能！”好脾气的伯爵直率地说，“这样的事，她从未向我提过一个字。”可敬的伯爵做梦也想不到，是那强烈的爱情以及成千上万的忧虑和忧伤搅动了处女的心，胆怯的姑娘甚至不肯面对。","The Count shook his head as the door closed.“Something is the matter with that child,” said he, “which I cannot divine.She has lost all health and spirits lately.She was always a tender flower, and I had much pains to rear her.Excuse a father’s foolishness,” continued he, “but I have seen much trouble in my family; and this poor girl is all that is now left to me; and she used to be so lively—” —“Maybe she’s in love!” said the little Princess, with a shrewd nod of the head.—“Impossible!” replied the good Count, artlessly.“She has never mentioned a word of such a thing to me.” How little did the worthy gentleman dream of the thousand cares, and griefs, and mighty love concerns which agitate a virgin heart, and which a timid girl scarce breathes unto herself."
"王爵夫人的侄子突然站起来，在房间里来回踱着步。当小姐一个人回到房间里时，这个年轻女孩长久压抑的情感，一下子猛烈地迸发了出来。她打开窗户，让冷空气吹在她跳动的双鬓上。也许她的情绪中还混杂着一些骄傲与愤怒，那是她本来温柔的本性中所没有的。","The nephew of the Princess rose abruptly and walked about the room.When she found herself alone in her chamber, the feelings of the young lady, so long restrained, broke forth with violence.She opened the casement, that the cool air might blow upon her throbbing temples.Perhaps there was some little pride or pique mingled with her emotions; though her gentle nature did not seem calculated to harbour any such angry inmate."
"“他看见我哭了，”她说，忽然满面通红，喉咙肿胀，“但是不要紧！不要紧！”","“He saw me weep,” said she, with a sudden mantling of the cheek, and a swelling of the throat,—“but no matter!—no matter!”"
"说着，她把雪白的手臂交叉扶在窗框上，埋头纵情痛哭起来。她趴在那里出神，直到听见隔壁房间里父亲和卡斯珀的声音，才知道大家都去睡了。灯光沿着一个个窗子移动过去，她知道是他们领着王爵夫人到卧室去了，那是旅店对面的一排房间，透过一个窗子，她还清楚地看见了伯爵夫人侄子的影子。她深深地叹了一口气。正要关窗时，听见窗下有人窃窃私语，这两个人刚从房子的一角转过来。“那个可怜的年轻女孩会怎么样呢？”一个声音说，她听出是那个女仆的声音。","And so saying, she threw her white arms across the window-frame, buried her face in them, and abandoned herself to an agony of tears.She remained lost in a reverie, until the sound of her father’s and Caspar’s voices in the adjoining room gave token that the party had retired for the night.The lights gleaming from window to window, showed that they were conducting the Princess to her apartment, which was in the opposite wing of the inn; and she distinctly saw the figure of the nephew as he passed one of the casements.She heaved a deep heart-drawn sigh, and was about to close the lattice, when her attention was caught by words spoken below her window by two persons who had just turned an angle of the building.“But what will become of the poor young lady?” said a voice, which she recognized for that of the servant-woman."
"“啐！她只能听天由命了。”老皮特罗回答。","“Pooh! she must take her chance,” was the reply from old Pietro."
"“难道不能饶了她吗？”女仆恳求道，“她多善良啊！”","“But cannot she be spared?” asked the other, entreatingly; “she’s so kind-hearted!”"
"“呸！你疯了吗？”老皮特罗愤怒地回答，“你要为了一个傻姑娘而坏事吗？”这时他们已经走远了，小姐听不到他们的声音了。","“Coapetto! what has got into thee?” replied the other, petulantly: “would you mar the whole business for the sake of a silly girl?” By this time they had got so far from the window that the Polonaise could hear nothing further."
"小姐所听到的这些只言片语，预示着什么危险。难道和自己有关么？如果是，女仆在为她求情，这迫在眉睫的危险究竟是什么呢？ 她屡次要敲开父亲的门，告诉他她所听见的话，但是她想也许是自己听错了，也许是没有听清楚，也许他们指的是另外一个人。总之，还不能得出确切的结论。正犹豫不决时，小姐听见有人轻轻敲她住的这间阴暗卧室的护墙板，敲击声来自房间某处稍远的地方，她被吓了一跳。她举灯一看，看见那儿有一扇小门，以前并没有发现。门是在里面上闩的。她走到门边问是谁，应声的是女仆。小姐开了门，女仆站在门外，脸色苍白，焦虑不安。她轻手轻脚地进来，手指放在嘴唇上示意要小心保密。","There was something in this fragment of conversation that was calculated to alarm.Did it relate to herself?—and if so, what was this impending danger from which it was entreated that she might be spared? She was several times on the point of tapping at her father’s door, to tell him what she had heard; but she might have been mistaken; she might have heard indistinctly; the conversation might have alluded to some one else; at any rate it was too indefinite to lead to any conclusion.While in this state of irresolution, she was startled by a low knocking against the wainscot in a remote part of her gloomy chamber.On holding up the light, she beheld a small door there, which she had not before remarked.It was bolted on the inside.She advanced, and demanded who knocked, and was answered in the voice of the female domestic.On opening the door, the woman stood before it pale and agitated.She entered softly, laying her finger on her lips in sign of caution and secrecy."
"“快逃！”她说，“立刻离开这里，否则你就要丧命了！”小姐被这个警告吓得瑟瑟发抖，想让女仆说清楚事情的原委。“我没有时间了，”女仆回答说，“我不敢说——如果我再多呆一会儿，我也完了。快逃吧，否则你就没命了。”“丢下我父亲？”“他在哪？”“在隔壁房间。”“那么快去叫他，别耽误时间。”","“Fly!” said she: “leave this house instantly, or you are lost!”—The young lady, trembling with alarm, demanded an explanation.—“I have no time,” replied the woman, “I dare not—I shall be missed if I linger here—but fly instantly, or you are lost.”—“And leave my father?”—“Where is he?”—“In the adjoining chamber.”—“Call him, then, but lose no time.”"
"小姐去敲父亲的房门。他还没有睡下。她急忙走到房里，把自己听到的危险警告告诉他。伯爵随后来到她的房间，卡斯珀也跟了过来。在他的盘问下，女仆立刻局促不安地交代了实情。旅店就要被强盗包围了。午夜过后，强盗会被引来，那时王爵夫人的随从和其他旅客都睡熟了，便形同瓮中捉鳖。","The young lady knocked at her father’s door.He was not yet retired to bed.She hurried into his room and told him of the fearful warning she had received.The Count returned with her into her chamber, followed by Caspar.His questions soon drew the truth out of the embarrassed answers of the woman.The inn was beset by robbers.They were to be introduced after midnight, when the attendants of the Princess and the rest of the travellers were sleeping, and would be an easy prey."
"“但是我们可以堵住旅店的大门，我们可以自卫反击。”伯爵说。“没用的！旅店里的人和强盗是一伙的。”“那么我们怎么逃脱呢？我们不能备好马车然后逃走吗？”“圣弗兰西斯！备车干什么？告诉强盗他们的计谋被识破了吗？这会让强盗们不顾一切立刻冲进来的。他们知道旅店里有贵重的财物，是不会轻易放过的。”“我们还有什么别的办法逃走？”“旅店后面有一匹马，”女仆说，“刚才有人骑着这匹马到远处去拉拢那里的一批强盗，回来后把马留下了。”“一匹马！我们有三个人！”伯爵说。“还有西班牙王爵夫人！”女儿着急地喊道，“怎样救她脱险呢？”","“But we can barricade the inn, we can defend ourselves,” said the Count.—“What! when the people of the inn were in league with the banditti?”—“How then are we to escape? Can we not order out the carriage and depart?”—“San Francesco! for what? To give the alarm that the plot is discovered? That would make the robbers desperate, and bring them on you at once.They have had notice of the rich booty in the inn, and will not easily let it escape them.”—“But how else are we to get off?”—“There is a horse behind the inn,” said the woman, “from which the man has just dismounted who has been to summon the aid of a part of the band who were at a distance.”—“One horse! and there are three of us!” said the Count.—“And the Spanish Princess!” cried the daughter anxiously.“How can she be extricated from the danger?”"
"“魔鬼！她与我有什么相干？”女仆突然怒道，“我是来救你的，你却要害我，我们全都要完蛋！听！”她接着说道，“他们在叫我——我会被发现的——最后一句话。这个门连着的楼梯直达院子。院子后面有一个棚，棚下的门可以一直通到外面的田野。那里有一匹马，你们骑上它，会看到一座山，绕着山的影子走，要小心安静。穿过一条小溪，就是大路了，那里有三个白十字架钉在树上，然后你们就快马加鞭跑到村子里。但是记住，我的性命在你们手里，对你们所看到的、听到的和旅店里将要发生的都要要守口如瓶。”","“Diavolo! what is she to me?” said the woman in sudden passion.“It is @you@ I come to save, and you will betray me, and we shall all be lost! Hark!” continued she, “I am called—I shall be discovered—one word more.This door leads by a staircase to the court-yard.Under the shed, in the rear of the yard, is a small door leading out to the fields.You will find a horse there; mount it: make a circuit under the shadow of a ridge of rocks that you will see; proceed cautiously and quietly until you cross a brook, and find yourself on the road just where there are three white crosses nailed against a tree; then put your horse to his speed, and make the best of your way to the village—but recollect, my life is in your hands—say nothing of what you have heard or seen, whatever may happen at this inn.”"
"女仆匆匆走了。伯爵父女和老兵卡斯珀三人短暂而激烈的商量了一会。看起来，年轻的小姐由于担心王爵夫人而完全不顾自己的安危。“一声不响地自己逃走，留下她被人杀害！”一想到这里她就浑身发抖。侠胆豪情的伯爵也反对这么做。他不能丢下这些手无寸铁的旅客一走了之，让他们蒙在鼓里，不知大难临头。","The woman hurried away.A short and agitated consultation took place between the Count, his daughter, and the veteran Caspar.The young lady seemed to have lost all apprehension for herself in her solicitude for the safety of the Princess.“To fly in selfish silence, and leave her to be massacred!” A shuddering seized her at the very thought.The gallantry of the Count, too, revolted at the idea.He could not consent to turn his back upon a party of helpless travellers, and leave them in ignorance of the danger which hung over them."
"“但是小姐怎么办？”卡斯珀说，“如果警告大家，旅店里会一片混乱。万一打起来，小姐会有多么危险呀！”这些话激起了伯爵的爱女之情，他望着他那可爱而无助的孩子，想到她可能会落入强盗之手就害怕得浑身发抖。","“But what is to become of the young lady,” said Caspar, “if the alarm is given, and the inn thrown in a tumult? What may happen to her in a chance medley affray?” Here the feelings of the father were roused: he looked upon his lovely, helpless child, and trembled at the chance of her falling into the hands of ruffians."
"然而，女儿却没有考虑到自身的安危。“伯爵夫人！伯爵夫人！只要让伯爵夫人知道她有危险就好。”她愿意与伯爵夫人共患难。","The daughter, however, thought nothing of herself.“The Princess! the Princess!—only let the Princess know her danger.” She was willing to share it with her."
"后来，卡斯珀以一个老仆人的耿耿忠心从中调节。一刻也不能再耽搁了，最重要的是让小姐脱离危险。“你骑马，”卡斯珀对伯爵说，“带着小姐一起逃走！你逃到村里，叫醒村民来救我们。我留在这里警告王爵夫人和她的随从。我是一个老兵，我想我们能坚守到你给我们派救兵来。”","At length Caspar interfered, with the zeal of a faithful old servant.No time was to be lost—the first thing was to get the young lady out of danger.“Mount the horse,” said he to the Count, “take her behind you, and fly! Make for the village, rouse the inhabitants, and send assistance.Leave me here to give the alarm to the Princess and her people.I am an old soldier, and I think we shall be able to stand siege until you send us aid.”"
"女儿还要坚持和王爵夫人呆在一起。“为什么？”老兵卡斯珀直率地说，“你手无寸铁，只会碍手碍脚，我们反而要照顾你。”","The daughter would again have insisted on staying with the Princess.“For what?” said old Caspar bluntly.“You could do no good—you would be in the way—we should have to take care of you instead of ourselves.”"
"对这些反问的话，小姐一言不发。伯爵抓起枪，用胳膊夹住女儿就往楼梯走。小姐停下又走回来，紧张颤抖地说：“有个年轻骑士跟王爵夫人在一起——就是她的侄儿——也许他可以——”","There was no answering these objections: the Count seized his pistols, and taking his daughter under his arm, moved towards the staircase.The young lady paused, stepped back, and said, faltering with agitation—“There is a young cavalier with the Princess—her nephew—perhaps he may—”"
"“小姐，我明白，”老卡斯珀回答，意味深长地点点头，“只要我做得到，我绝不会让他损伤一根汗毛。”","“I understand you, mademoiselle,” replied old Caspar, with a significant nod; “not a hair of his head shall suffer harm if I can help it!”"
"小姐的脸从未这样红过，她没想到这个直率的老仆对她了解如此之深。","The young lady blushed deeper than ever; she had not anticipated being so thoroughly understood by the blunt old servant."
"“这不是我的意思。”她迟疑地说。她还想再说些什么，或者解释一下，但是时间宝贵，父亲也在催促她快走。","“That is not what I mean,” said she, hesitating.She would have added something, or made some explanation, but the moments were precious, and her father hurried her away."
"他们穿过院子走到那个小小的后门，那里果然有一匹马，栓在墙上的一个环上。伯爵上了马，小姐坐在后面，按着女仆指出的方向，尽可能悄悄地前行。小姐无数次地充满焦虑和恐惧回望那些昏暗的房子：积满灰尘的窗子里微弱的灯光一个接一个地熄灭了，说明店里的旅客渐渐入睡了。她焦虑地颤抖着，唯恐旅客们被危险惊醒时，救兵还到不了。","They found their way through the court-yard to the small postern gate, where the horse stood fastened to a ring in the wall.The Count mounted, took his daughter behind him, and they proceeded as quietly as possible in the direction which the woman had pointed out.Many a fearful and an anxious look did the daughter cast back upon the gloomy pile of building: the lights which had feebly twinkled through the dusty casements were one by one disappearing, a sign that the house was gradually sinking to repose; and she trembled with impatience, lest succour should not arrive until that repose had been fatally interrupted."
"他们静悄悄地沿着山岭的边缘前进，岩石垂下长长的影子，保护了他们的安全。他们穿过小溪，走到钉着三个白十字架的树旁，说明这里曾发生过谋杀案。刚刚到达这个不祥的地方，他们便看到阴暗处有几个人从山岭上一条崎岖的隘路走下来。","They passed silently and safely along the skirte of the rocks, protected from observation by their overhanging shadows.They crossed the brook, and reached the place where three white crosses nailed against a tree, told of some murder that had been committed there.Just as they had reached this illomened spot they beheld several men in the gloom, coming down a craggy defile among the rocks."
"“来的是什么人？”一个声音喊道。伯爵策马前进，但是其中一人跳过来抓住了马缰。马儿受了惊，突然后退，暴跳起来。若不是紧紧地抱住父亲，小姐就被甩下来了。伯爵身子前倾，对准强盗的头放了一枪。强盗倒地死了。马儿向前奔去。两三枚子弹从逃命的父女身边呼啸而过，吓得他们更加拼命奔跑。最后，他们平安到达村庄。","“Who goes there?” exclaimed a voice.The Count put spurs to his horse, but one of the men sprang forward and seized the bridle.The horse became restive, started back, and reared, and had not the young lady clung to her father, she would have been thrown off.The Count leaned forward, put a pistol to the very head of the ruffian, and fired.The latter fell dead.The horse sprang forward.Two or three shots were fired which whistled by the fugitives, but only served to augment their speed.They reached the village in safety."
"很快，整个村子的人都被唤醒了，但是村民畏惧强盗，都不敢和他们正面交锋。听说，有一伙亡命的强盗出没于这个山隘已经很久了。人们早就怀疑那家旅店是一个可怕的地方，毫无戒心的旅客落入陷阱，无声无息地被谋杀。邋遢的女店主所戴的贵重首饰也非常惹人生疑。这样的事情已发生过几次了。一些小的旅队在那条路上神秘地失踪了。起初，人们猜测是强盗为了索要赎金，绑架了他们，但后来都音讯全无。当伯爵竭力鼓动村民去营救处境危险的王爵夫人和她的随从时，村民们却七嘴八舌地对伯爵讲着这些传言。小姐也在一旁给父亲帮忙，凭借美貌，留着眼泪苦苦地劝说村民。每拖延一分钟，她的焦虑就增加一分，直至极度痛苦。幸运的是，村里驻扎了一队警察。一些年轻的村民也自愿加入。于是，一支小小的军队就出发了。伯爵把女儿安置在安全的地方。由于担心老兵卡斯珀，他飞速地赶往危险的旅店。年轻的小姐等待时的焦躁和不安，简直难以言说。","The whole place was soon aroused, but such was the awe in which the banditti were held, that the inhabitants shrunk at the idea of encountering them.A desperate band had for some time infested that pass through the mountains, and the inn had long been suspected of being one of those horrible places where the unsuspicious wayfarer is entrapped and silently disposed of.The rich ornaments worn by the slattern hostess of the inn had excited heavy suspicions.Several instances had occurred of small parties of travellers disappearing mysteriously on that road, who it was supposed, at first, had been carried off by the robbers for the sake of ransom, but who had never been heard of more.Such were the tales buzzed in the ears of the Count by the villagers as he endeavoured to rouse them to the rescue of the Princess and her train from their perilous situation.The daughter seconded the exertions of her father with all the eloquence of prayers, and tears, and beauty.Every moment that elapsed increased her anxiety, until it became agonizing.Fortunately, there was a body of gensdarmes resting at the village.A number of the young villagers volunteered to accompany them, and the little army was put in motion.The Count having deposited his daughter in a place of safety, was too much of the old soldier not to hasten to the scene of danger.It would be difficult to paint the anxious agitation of the young lady while awaiting the result."
"救兵及时到达了旅店。强盗们发现计谋被识破，旅客们也在准备反击，强盗们就公开地展开了猛烈的进攻。王爵夫人的随从们在一间套房里筑好防御，从门口、窗户抵御强盗。卡斯珀展现了一个老兵的将才，伯爵夫人的侄子也显出了一个年轻军人的勇猛。然而，他们的弹药即将耗尽，很难再坚持下去。就在此时，警察的步枪声，给他们传来了援军已到的喜讯。","The party arrived at the inn just in time.The robbers, finding their plans discovered, and the travellers prepared for their reception, had become open and furious in their attack.The Princess’s party had barricaded themselves in one suite of apartments and repulsed the robbers from the doors and windows.Caspar had shown the generalship of a veteran, and the nephew of the Princess the dashing valour of a young soldier.Their ammunition, however, was nearly exhausted, and they would have found it difficult to hold out much longer, when a discharge from the musketry of the gensdarmes gave them the joyful tidings of succour."
"随后，一场激烈的战斗开始了。旅店里的强盗现在反而被旅客围攻，竭力突围。而他们的同伙，在附近山岩和树丛的掩护下，拼命想解救他们。","A fierce fight ensued, for part of the robbers were surprised in the inn, and had to stand siege in their turn, while their comrades made desperate attempts to relieve them, from under coyer of the neighbouring rocks and thickets."
"关于这场战斗，我听说过各种说法，因此我不能假装知情，说出当时详细的情况。但可以断定的是强盗被打败了，几个被杀，几个被俘。这些俘虏与旅店里的人一道，有的被处以死刑，有的被罚做苦工。","I cannot pretend to give a minute account of the fight, as I have heard it related in a variety of ways.Suffice it to say, the robbers were defeated; several of them killed, and several taken prisoners; which last, together with the people of the inn, were either executed or sent to the galleys."
"事情发生后不久，我在一次旅行中听说了这些。我还曾路过那个旅店。那时它已被夷为平地，只剩下一间偏房，里面驻守着一队警察。他们把窗框上，墙上和门板上的子弹孔指给我看。附近的树枝上还挂着许多干枯的四肢，在空气中已经发黑了。据说是那些被杀的强盗和被处死的犯人的肢体。整个地方一派阴沉、荒凉、凄惨的景象。“王爵夫人的随从有被打死的吗？”英国人问。“据我所知，有两三个。”“我相信不是她的侄子！”美丽的威尼斯女人说。“哦，不是他。他急忙跟着伯爵给小姐带去胜利的消息，以消除她的焦虑。年轻的姑娘凭着强烈的感情，经受住了一次又一次的惊吓。看到王爵夫人的侄子陪着父亲安全归来，她喜极而泣，昏了过去。幸而她很快就醒过来了，而且，不久她就嫁给了那个年轻的骑士。一行人陪同着王爵夫人到洛雷托朝圣去了。她奉献的礼品也许仍可以在圣卡萨的宝库中找到。”","I picked up these particulars in the course of a journey which I made some time after the event had taken place.I passed by the very inn.It was then dismantled, excepting one wing, in which a body of gensdarmes was stationed.They pointed out to me the shot holes in the window-frames, the walls, and the panels of the doors.There were a number of withered limbs dangling from the branches of a neighbouring tree, and blackening in the air, which I was told were the limbs of the robbers who had been slain, and the culprits who had been executed.The whole place had a dismal, wild, forlorn look.—“Were any of the Princess’s party killed?” inquired the Englishman.—“As far as I can recollect, there were two or three.”—“Not the nephew, I trust?” said the fair Venetian.—“Oh no: he hastened with the Count to relieve the anxiety of the daughter by the assurances of victory.The young lady had been sustained throughout the intervals of suspense by the very intensity of her feelings.The moment she saw her father returning in safety, accompanied by the nephew of the Princess, she uttered a cry of rapture and fainted.Happily, however, she soon recovered, and what is more, was married shortly after to the young cavalier, and the whole party accompanied the old Princess in her pilgrimage to Loretto, where her votive offerings may still be seen in the treasury of the Santa Casa.”"
"听这样曲折迂回的会话仿佛穿越故事迷宫一样，让人觉得乏味无趣。直到新来的两个旅客把它打断——霍布斯和多布斯，一个是布商，一个是水果商。他们随着护送队刚刚从希腊和巴勒斯坦匆忙旅行回来。他俩满肚子都是关于市政官波普金斯的故事。使他们惊讶的是，强盗们居然敢抢劫商品交易所的重要人物，他不仅是色罗格莫顿街上知名的干货商，还是一个地方行政官员。","It would be tedious to follow the devious course of the conversation as it wound through a maze of stories of the kind, until it was taken up by two other travellers who had come under convoy of the Procaccio: Mr. Hobbs and Mr. Dobbs; a linendraper and a greengrocer, just returning from a hasty tour in Greece and the Holy Land.They were full of the story of Alderman Popkins.They were astonished that the robbers should dare to molest a man of his importance on Change, he being an eminent drysalter of Throgmorton Street, and a magistrate to boot."
"事实上，波普金斯一家的故事是千真万确的。不容有任何一丝怀疑，许多在场的人都可以出来作证。这些证词有些是矛盾的，有些是一致的，但是大家都会热心地提出来，并一起讨论。这样，英国人才收集到了下面这些材料。","In fact, the story of the Popkins family was but too true.It was attested by too many present to be for a moment doubted; and from the contradictory and concordant testimony of half a score, all eager to relate it, and all talking at the same time, the Englishman was enabled to gather the following particulars."
