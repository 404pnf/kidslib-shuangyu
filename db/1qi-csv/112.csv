"焦油博士和羽毛教授的疗法","The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether"
"作者：艾德加·爱伦·坡","by Edgar Allan Poe"
"那是一八几几年的秋天，我在法国南端的几个省份游历，途中来到距一家私立医院，也就是私立疯人院几英里的地方。我在巴黎时常听医学界的朋友们说起这家疯人院。我以前从未参观过这种地方，觉得机不可失，便向我的旅伴（几天前偶然结识的一位绅士）提议，花个把小时转过去，看看这家疯人院。他对此表示反对， 说是一来时间紧，二来，他一看到疯子就习惯性地感到恐惧。不过，他恳请我不要出于对他的礼貌就不去满足自己的好奇心，并说他会信马由缰、徐徐前行，这样，我当天，或者最迟第二天就可以赶上他。当他向我道别时，我突然想到恐怕不能轻易进入那家疯人院，就把这种担心对他说了。他说，除非我认识院长马亚尔先生，或者有一封能证明身份的信件，否则，的确可能会有困难，因为这些私立疯人院的规章制度比起公立医院来要更为苛刻。他又补充说，自己几年前就与马亚尔结识，愿意陪我到疯人院门口，把我介绍给院长，尽管他听到疯子的话题就不寒而栗，不愿进到医院里面去。","During the autumn of 18—, while on a tour through the extreme southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles of a certain Maison de Sante or private mad-house, about which I had heard much in Paris from my medical friends.As I had never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days before) that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look through the establishment.To this he objected—pleading haste in the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic.He begged me, however, not to let any mere courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the next.As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and mentioned my fears on this point.He replied that, in fact, unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws.For himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house."
"我向他表示了谢意，之后，我们两人便离开大路，踏上了一条长满杂草的旁道。走了有半个小时，小路便几乎淹没在山脚下的一片密林中。在潮湿阴暗的树林里穿行了约两英里，那家私立医院便进入了我们的视野。这是一座形状怪异的城堡，破损严重，甚至因年久失修，几乎不能居住。城堡破旧的外观让我感到极度恐慌，我勒住马缰，几欲转身离去。但我很快就为自己的脆弱感到羞愧，于是继续驱马前行。","I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain.Through this dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the Maison de Sante came in view.It was a fantastic chateau, much dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and neglect.Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and, checking my horse, I half resolved to turn back.I soon, however, grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded."
"来到门口，我发现大门微微开启，一个男人正在向外张望。 随即，这个男人就走上前来，喊着我同伴的名字，热情地握着他的手，请他下马。这个人就是马亚尔先生。他是个身材肥胖、相貌堂堂的老派绅士，举止温文尔雅，神态严肃、庄重又不失威严，令人印象深刻。","As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and the visage of a man peering through.In an instant afterward, this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight.It was Monsieur Maillard himself.He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity, dignity, and authority which was very impressive."
"我的朋友把我引见给他，说我想到院里参观一番。在马亚尔先生承诺会对我倍加关照之后，他就告辞了，从此我们便再未相见。","My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard’s assurance that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw him no more."
"朋友走后，院长带我进入一间面积不大却异常整洁的接待室。房间的陈设彰显了高雅的品味，其中陈列着许多书籍、绘画、瓶花和乐器。壁炉里，火苗在欢快地燃烧。一位美丽动人的年轻女子，坐在钢琴旁，唱着贝利尼的咏叹调。见我进来，她便止住了歌声，优雅地接待了我。她说话时低声细语，一举一动都显得很克制。我想，我从她脸上看到了忧伤的痕迹。她脸色惨白，尽管在我看来并不让人生厌。她身披重孝，在我内心唤起一种混杂着尊敬、好奇和爱慕的情愫。","When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical instruments.A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth.At a piano, singing an aria from Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me with graceful courtesy.Her voice was low, and her whole manner subdued.I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not unpleasingly, pale.She was attired in deep mourning, and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and admiration."
"我在巴黎时就听说，马亚尔先生的疯人院的管理方法俗称为“抚慰疗法”——要避免一切惩罚——就连关禁闭也极少使用——病人们受到秘密监视，可表面上被赋予很多自由，他们中的大多数人都可以穿着正常人的普通衣服在房间和院子里随意溜达。","I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of soothing”—that all punishments were avoided—that even confinement was seldom resorted to—that the patients, while secretly watched, were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind."
"脑子有了这些印象，我在那位年轻女士面前说话时便有了几分谨慎，因为我不能确定她的神志是否正常。事实上，她眼睛里闪烁着一种焦躁不安的光芒，多少让我感觉她神志不正常。因此，我把谈话内容局限于一般话题，和那些我认为即使对一个疯子来说也不会引起不快或造成刺激的话题。对我所说的一切，她的应答都十分合理；甚至她自己主动发起的话题也说得头头是道、极富理性。但是，对躁狂症的深奥莫测的长期了解让我无法相信这些心智健全的迹象，因此，在整个交谈中，我一直保持着开始时的谨慎 。                                                                                                                                                                 ","Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane; and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not.I confined my remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic.She replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with which I commenced it."
"不久，一个身穿制服的机敏的男仆端来一盘水果、葡萄酒和其他茶点，我吃了点。这位女士随后便离开了房间。她离开时，我转过脸，带着询问的目光看着主人。","Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit, wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon afterward leaving the room.As she departed I turned my eyes in an inquiring manner toward my host."
"“不是，”他说，“啊，不是——我的家人——我侄女，一位多才多艺的女士。”","“No,” he said, “oh, no—a member of my family—my niece, and a most accomplished woman.”"
"“万分抱歉！还望原谅我刚才的怀疑。”我回答道，“但是，您当然知道该怎样原谅我。您对疯人院的出色管理在巴黎是广为称道的。我想可能，您知道——”","“I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” I replied, “but of course you will know how to excuse me.The excellent administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris, and I thought it just possible, you know—”"
"“知道，知道——别再说了——倒是我自己应该感谢您刚才表现出了值得称道的谨慎。我们很少见到年轻人有如此周到的；因为参观者的轻率，不止一次发生了意外。在我实施先前的疗法时，允许病人们随意溜达，但常常有不明智的来访者使他们过分激动，造成危险。于是，我被迫实施了严格的准入制度，凡是我认为行事不够谨慎的人，都不允许踏入院内。”","“Yes, yes—say no more—or rather it is myself who should thank you for the commendable prudence you have displayed.We seldom find so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some unhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors.While my former system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to inspect the house.Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion I could not rely.”"
"“您实施先前的疗法时！”我重复着他的话，“那么我是不是可以理解成，我之前常听说的‘抚慰疗法’已经不再使用了？”","“While your former system was in operation!” I said, repeating his words—“do I understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing system’ of which I have heard so much is no longer in force?”"
"“到现在，”他回答道，“我们决定彻底放弃这种疗法已经有几个星期了。”","“It is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded to renounce it forever.”"
"“是么！您真让我感到惊讶！”","“Indeed! you astonish me!”"
"“我们发现，先生，”他叹了口气说，“回归传统做法是绝对有必要的。抚慰疗法的危险是它始终让人提心吊胆；人们过分高估了它的好处。我相信，先生，我们院对这种疗法进行了一次公正的试验，如果说曾在哪里试验过的话。我们尽己所能做了按人类理性来说应该做的一切。很遗憾您没能早些时候来我们这里参观。那样的话，您就可以自己做出评判。但是我相信您非常熟悉抚慰疗法——包括它的所有细节。”","“We found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary to return to the old usages.The danger of the soothing system was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much overrated.I believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a fair trial, if ever in any.We did every thing that rational humanity could suggest.I am sorry that you could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for yourself.But I presume you are conversant with the soothing practice—with its details.”"
"“并非完全如此。我听到的都是几经转述的说法。”","“Not altogether.What I have heard has been at third or fourth hand.”"
"“笼统地说，这种疗法就是极力迁就病人。我们对病人脑子里冒出的任何怪念头都不反对。相反，我们不仅迁就他们，而且还鼓励他们。我们的许多病人就是这样彻底治愈的。任何说理方式都不如归谬法那样能触动病人那脆弱的理性。例如，我们院曾经有病人幻想自己是小鸡。我们的疗法是，坚持把这种念头当作事实——责备病人笨得连这点事实都整不明白——因此，一个星期里只给他适合小鸡吃的东西，别的一概不给。就这样，一点谷物和砂砾，就创造了奇迹。”","“I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which the patients were menages-humored.We contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad.On the contrary, we not only indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent cures have been thus effected.There is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad absurdum.We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves chickens.The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact—to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact—and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken.In this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.”"
"“但是，仅靠这种顺应的方法就够了吗？”","“But was this species of acquiescence all?”"
"“当然不够。我们还十分相信简单娱乐活动的作用，比如音乐、舞蹈、一般的体操训练、打牌、某些类别的书籍，等等。我们假装把每个病人当成患有某种普通生理疾病的人，绝口不提‘疯子’二字。重要的一点是安排每个疯子监视所有其他疯子的行动。相信一个疯子的理解力或判断力，其目的就是要把他的全部身心都争取过来。用这样的方法，我们节省了雇佣看护的大笔开支。”","“By no means.We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind, such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards, certain classes of books, and so forth.We affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder, and the word ‘lunacy’ was never employed.A great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others.To repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to gain him body and soul.In this way we were enabled to dispense with an expensive body of keepers.”"
"“你们不使用任何惩罚？”","“And you had no punishments of any kind?”"
"“是的。”","“None.”"
"“也从来不关病人禁闭？”","“And you never confined your patients?”"
"“很少。偶尔，某个病人病情恶化，或突然变得狂暴，我们就把他送到一间密室，以免他的错乱感染其他病人。我们把他关在那里，直到可以放他回到他的朋友中间——因为对狂躁的疯子，我们一点法子都没有。他通常会被转到公立医院去。”","“Very rarely.Now and then, the malady of some individual growing to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends—for with the raging maniac we have nothing to do.He is usually removed to the public hospitals.”"
"“你们现在改变了这一切——而且您认为是为了取得更好的效果？”","“And you have now changed all this—and you think for the better?”"
"“确实如此。抚慰疗法有它的弊端，甚至是存在危险性。令人高兴的是，现在法国的所有私立医院都摈弃了这一疗法。”","“Decidedly.The system had its disadvantages, and even its dangers.It is now, happily, exploded throughout all the Maisons de Sante of France.”"
"“听您这么说，”我说道，“我真是很吃惊。我满以为，目前全国各地没有其他治疗疯病的办法。”","“I am very much surprised,” I said, “at what you tell me; for I made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for mania existed in any portion of the country.”"
"“您还年轻啊，我的朋友。”我的主人说，“总有一天，您会学会自己对世上的事务做出判断，而不是相信他人的传言。不要轻信任何您听到的，对亲眼所见的也只能相信一半。就说我们院吧，很显然某个无知之辈误导了您。不过，晚餐后，等您从鞍马劳顿中完全恢复过来，我将很乐意带您到院里四处走走，向您介绍一种疗法。这种疗法，在我和每个见识过其作用的人看来，是迄今发明的最为有效的方法，是举世无双的。”","“You are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others.Believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see.Now about our Maisons de Sante, it is clear that some ignoramus has misled you.After dinner, however, when you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy to take you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.”"
"“是您自己？” 我探问道，“是您自己的发明吗？”","“Your own?” I inquired—“one of your own invention?”"
"“对此我感到非常骄傲，”他回答道，“是我的发明——至少在某种程度上是。”","“I am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is—at least in some measure.”"
"就这样，我和马亚尔先生交谈了有一两个小时，期间，他带我参观了院里的花园和温室。","In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of the place."
"“眼下，”他说，“我还不能让您见我的病人。对一颗敏感的心而言，看到那些病人总会或多或少有些震惊，而且我不希望破坏您晚餐的食欲。我们就要用晚餐了。我可以给您吃一些圣梅努风味小牛肉，配上白汁花椰菜——然后，喝一杯伏旧园的葡萄酒——这样您的神经就可以变得足够镇定。","“I cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present.To a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner.We will dine.I can give you some veal a la Menehoult, with cauliflowers in veloute sauce—after that a glass of Clos de Vougeot—then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.”"
"六点钟，通知说晚餐已经就绪。主人陪我走进一个大餐厅，里面已经聚集了一大群人——总共有二十五或三十人。看上去他们都是有身份的人——无疑出身高贵——尽管在我看来，他们的服饰过于华丽，颇有几分过去宫廷奢华服装的炫耀成分。我注意到这些客人中女士占了至少有三分之二。她们中有些人的着装打扮一点也不符合当今巴黎人的审美品味。比如说，许多女士已年逾七十，但却打扮得浑身珠光宝气，戴着戒指、手镯和耳环，还不知羞耻地袒露着胸部和胳膊。我还注意到，她们的衣服没有几件做工精细的——或者至少可以说没有几件是合身的。环顾四周，我发现了马亚尔先生在小接待室向我引见过的那个有趣的姑娘。令我惊讶的是，她身穿一件带有鲸骨衬箍的裙子，脚蹬一双高跟鞋，头戴一顶肮脏的布鲁塞尔花边女帽。对她而言，帽子显然过大，把她的脸衬得太小，显得很滑稽。我第一次见到她时，她那一身重孝倒与她非常相配。总之，这群人的穿戴有种怪异的色彩。起初，这让我又想到了原来对“抚慰疗法”的理解，心想，马亚尔先生有意要等到晚餐结束后才告诉我真相，是想让我在用餐期间没什么不舒服的感觉，事后才知道自己是和一群疯子共进晚餐。但是我又想起在巴黎时有人告诉我，南方的乡下人都特别古怪，他们固守着众多陈腐的观念。随后，我和周围的人们交谈起来，我的担心立刻烟消云散了。","At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a large salle a manger, where a very numerous company were assembled—twenty-five or thirty in all.They were, apparently, people of rank—certainly of high breeding—although their habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vieille cour.I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day.Many females, for example, whose age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings, bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare.I observed, too, that very few of the dresses were well made—or, at least, that very few of them fitted the wearers.In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale, with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression.When I had first seen her, she was attired, most becomingly, in deep mourning.There was an air of oddity, in short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first, caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,” and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people, with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled."
"餐厅本身尽管足够舒适，也较为宽敞，却不大雅致。譬如，地板上没铺地毯，不过在法国，地毯并不常用。窗户上也没有挂窗帘，百叶窗关着，被铁条沿对角牢牢固定住了，就像我们普通的商店百叶窗一样。我注意到， 餐厅本身是城堡的侧厅。因此，这个平行四边形的大厅三面开窗，门则开在另外一面。窗户加起来多达十扇。","The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about it.For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a carpet is frequently dispensed with.The windows, too, were without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of our ordinary shop-shutters.The apartment, I observed, formed, in itself, a wing of the chateau, and thus the windows were on three sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other.There were no less than ten windows in all."
"餐桌布置奢华。满桌的盘子里盛满了美味佳肴。其奢侈程度的确毫无节制。肉食多得足以喂饱亚衲族人（注：“亚衲族”出自《旧约》，指巨人）。有生以来，我还从未见过如此奢侈铺张、暴殄天物的。然而，整体布置似乎没有什么品味。餐桌上和房间里见缝插针地摆放着银质枝形大烛台，上面无数根蜡烛射出耀眼的光芒，让我习惯于柔和灯光的眼睛感到不舒服。几位殷勤的仆人在伺候我们。房间那头的一张大桌子上，坐着七八个人，手里拿着提琴、横笛、长号和鼓。晚餐过程中，这几个家伙不时弄出各种嘈杂之声，令我很是厌烦。这些噪音，原是作为音乐演奏的，在座的人们好像都陶醉其中，只有我自己是个例外。","The table was superbly set out.It was loaded with plate, and more than loaded with delicacies.The profusion was absolutely barbaric.There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim.Never, in all my life, had I witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of life.There seemed very little taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was possible to find a place.There were several active servants in attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes, trombones, and a drum.These fellows annoyed me very much, at intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises, which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself."
"总而言之，我不禁认为我所见的一切都非常怪异荒诞——不过话说回来，世界是由各种各样的人组成的，他们有着不同的思想方式，不同的社会习俗。我游历过太多地方，可以说见怪不怪是我的拿手好戏。于是，我在主人的右手旁泰然而座，放开胃口，津津有味地享用摆在面前的美味佳肴。","Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing I saw—but then the world is made up of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts of conventional customs.I had travelled, too, so much, as to be quite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite, did justice to the good cheer set before me."
"与此同时，到处响起人们热烈的谈话声。女士们照例说个不停。我很快就发现在座的人们几乎都受过良好的教育；而我的主人本身就充满了非常幽默的轶事。他似乎很乐意谈及他私立医院院长的身份，而且，令我惊讶的是，在座的各位的确都热衷于谈论有关疯子的话题。他们讲了许多有趣的故事，都是有关病人的古怪念头的。","The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general.The ladies, as usual, talked a great deal.I soon found that nearly all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of good-humored anecdote in himself.He seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a Maison de Sante; and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a favorite one with all present.A great many amusing stories were told, having reference to the whims of the patients."
"“我们这里曾有个病人，”坐在我右手的一个矮胖的绅士说，“他认为自己是只茶壶，顺便问一句，这难道不奇特吗？疯子的脑海里怎么会经常冒出这种怪念头？法国的每一家疯人院几乎都有这么一只人壶。我们的这位先生是一只不大列颠陶瓷茶壶，每天早上会用鹿皮和白垩粉仔细擦拭自己一番。”","“We had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat at my right,—“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the way, is it not especially singular how often this particular crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic?There is scarcely an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot.Our gentleman was a Britannia-ware tea-pot, and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.”"
"“还有，”正对面一个高个子男子说，“不久前，我们这里有个病人非认为自己是头驴——从讽喻的角度来说，您会觉得这话没错。这个病人很烦人，我们费了好大劲才让他规矩下来。有很长一段时间，他除了蓟草什么都不吃。不过我们很快就通过坚持不给他吃任何其他东西的方法将他治愈。然后，他就一刻不停地尥蹶子——就像这样——这样——”","“And then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkey—which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite true.He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep him within bounds.For a long time he would eat nothing but thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon his eating nothing else.Then he was perpetually kicking out his heels—so—so—”"
"“德科克先生！拜托您规矩点！”坐在说话者旁边的一位老太太打断了他的话。","“Mr. De Kock! I will thank you to behave yourself!” here interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. "
"“请不要乱踢！您把我的锦缎衣服都踢脏了！请问，解释一句话需要这么又踢又蹬吗？您不这样比划，我们这位朋友也肯定能明白的。说实在的，您简直就是一头活生生的驴子， 和那位可怜的、不幸的病人想象中的自己一样。您的表演十分到位，真的。”","“Please keep your feet to yourself!You have spoiled my brocade!Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this.Upon my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself.Your acting is very natural, as I live.”"
"“十分抱歉！小姐！”那位被称作德科克的先生回答道，“非常抱歉！我无意冒犯您。拉普拉斯小姐——德科克先生十分荣幸地想与您喝一杯。”","“Mille pardons! Ma’m’selle! replied Monsieur De Kock, thus addressed—“a thousand pardons!”I had no intention of offending.Ma’m’selle Laplace—Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of taking wine with you.”"
"这时，德科克先生深鞠一躬，又煞有介事地吻了吻自己的手，然后和拉普拉斯小姐干杯。","Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much ceremony, and took wine with Ma’m’selle Laplace."
"“请允许我，我的朋友，”这时，马亚尔先生对我说，“请允许我给您一小份圣梅努风味小牛肉——您会觉得味道非常鲜美的。”","“Allow me, mon ami,” now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing myself, “allow me to send you a morsel of this veal a la St. Menhoult—you will find it particularly fine.”"
"说话间，三个健壮的侍者恰好把一个巨大的盘子——或者说是一个大木盘安全、顺利地摆上餐桌， 里面盛着的东西在我看来正是维吉尔在《伊尼特》中描述的那种“可怕的、变形的、巨大的瞎眼怪物”。可是，仔细端详一番后，我悬着的心放下了。那不过是一只烤全乳牛，牛呈跪状，嘴里塞着一只苹果，和英国人烤野兔的方式如出一辙。","At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher, containing what I supposed to be the “monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.”A closer scrutiny assured me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English fashion of dressing a hare."
"“谢谢您，我不要。”我回答道，“说实话，我不是特别喜欢圣——圣什么小牛肉——我觉得它不怎么合我的口味。不过，我倒是想换只盘子，来点兔肉尝尝。”","“Thank you, no,” I replied; “to say the truth, I am not particularly partial to veal a la St.—what is it?—for I do not find that it altogether agrees with me.I will change my plate, however, and try some of the rabbit.”"
"桌子上有好几道配菜，里面的东西看上去像是普通的法国兔肉——一道美味的菜肴，能合我的口味。","There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit—a very delicious morceau, which I can recommend."
"“皮埃尔，”主人大声说道，“给这位先生换只盘子来，然后给他来点这种猫肉烩兔肉。”","“Pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.”"
"“这种什么？” 我问。","“This what?” said I."
"“这种猫肉烩兔肉。”","“This rabbit au-chat.”"
"“呃，谢谢您——改主意了，不吃它了。我还是自己来点火腿吧。”","“Why, thank you—upon second thoughts, no.I will just help myself to some of the ham.”"
"我暗自思忖，在这些乡下人的餐桌上，你真不知道自己吃的是些什么。我不吃他们的猫肉烩兔肉——同样，也一口不吃他们的兔肉烩猫肉。","There is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the tables of these people of the province.I will have none of their rabbit au-chat—and, for the matter of that, none of their cat-au-rabbit either."
"“还有，”靠近桌子下首一个面容枯槁的人拾起了刚才断了的话头，“还有，除了其他怪人，我们曾有过一个病人，他固执地认为自己是块科尔多瓦奶酪。他四下走动，手里拿着刀子，恳求他的朋友们从他腿的中部割下一片尝尝。”","“And then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken off,—“and then, among other oddities, we had a patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg.”"
"“毫无疑问，他是个十足的傻瓜。”有人插话，“不过远不如某个人，这个人我们都知道，当然这位新来的先生除外。我是说把自己当成一瓶香槟的那位。他总是发出‘砰’的开瓶声，嘶嘶地冒泡，就像这样。”","“He was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know, with the exception of this strange gentleman.I mean the man who took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.”"
"说到这里，说话者用我看来非常粗鲁的方式把右手大拇指杵进左面的腮帮子，往外一拔，发出瓶塞拔出时“砰”的声响，然后，舌头在牙齿上灵活地转动，发出类似香槟冒泡时的刺耳的嘶嘶声，这样一直持续了好几分钟。我清楚地看出，这样的行为令马亚尔先生感到不悦，但他什么也没说。一个戴着大号假发的干瘦的小个子男人接着这个话题说了起来。","Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of champagne.This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig."
"“我们还有过一个白痴，”他说，“他认为自己是只青蛙。顺便说一句，在很大程度上他的确像一只青蛙。我真希望您见过他，先生。”说到这里，他转向我，“您要是看到他那活灵活现的样子，一定会很开心的。先生，如果那个人不是一只青蛙的话，我只能说是一种遗憾了。","“And then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree.I wish you could have seen him, sir,”—here the speaker addressed myself—“it would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on.Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only observe that it is a pity he was not."
"他的蛙鸣声是这样的——咕—呱——咕—呱！是世界上最好听的音调——降B调。当他把双肘像这样放在桌子上——在喝了一两杯酒后——就会鼓起腮帮子，就像这样，翻起眼睛，就像这样，飞快地眨动，就像这样。这就是为什么，先生，我敢肯定地说，您一定会为这个人的天赋惊叹不已——我绝不是在讽刺他。”","His croak thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world—B flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus—after taking a glass or two of wine—and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus, why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.”"
"“对此我一点也不怀疑。”我应道。","“I have no doubt of it,” I said."
"“还有，”另一个人说，“还有珀蒂·加亚尔，他认为自己是一撮鼻烟。因为不能用食指和拇指把自己捏起来，而感到痛苦不已。”","“And then,” said somebody else, “then there was Petit Gaillard, who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb.”"
"“还有朱尔斯·德苏利埃斯，说真的，他可是个少见的天才，他疯狂地认为自己是个南瓜。他纠缠着厨师，非要厨师把他包在馅饼里——被厨师气愤地拒绝了。要让我说，德苏利埃斯南瓜馅饼吃起来肯定会非常可口！”","“And then there was Jules Desoulieres, who was a very singular genius, indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin.He persecuted the cook to make him up into pies—a thing which the cook indignantly refused to do.For my part, I am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie a la Desoulieres would not have been very capital eating indeed!”"
"“您真让我吃惊！”我说，同时，向马亚尔先生投去探询的目光。","“You astonish me!” said I; and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur Maillard."
"“哈！哈！哈！”那个绅士笑道——“嘻！嘻！嘻！——嘿！嘿！嘿！——嗬！嗬！嗬！——嗨！嗨！嗨！嗨！——真的非常可口！","“Ha! ha! ha!” said that gentleman—“he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu! hu!—very good indeed!"
"您千万别吃惊，我的朋友。我们这位朋友是个风趣的人——一个怪人——他的话您可不能按字面理解。”","You must not be astonished, mon ami; our friend here is a wit—a drole—you must not understand him to the letter.”"
"“还有呢，”人群中又有人说，“还有布封· 勒格朗，又一个与众不同、特立独行的人物。他因爱而精神错乱，认为自己长着两个脑袋。他非说其中一个是西塞罗（注：古罗马政治家、雄辩家、著作家）的，而另一个则是个合体，从额顶到嘴是德摩斯梯尼（注：古希腊辩论家）的，从嘴到下巴则是布鲁厄姆爵士（注：英国政治家）的。他显然是在胡说，但他会让你相信他所说的千真万确，因为他是个能言善辩之人。他对演讲有着狂热的激情和不可抑制的表现欲。例如，他那时常常跳上餐桌，就像这样，这样——这样——”","“And then,” said some other one of the party,—“then there was Bouffon Le Grand—another extraordinary personage in his way.He grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two heads.One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the other he imagined a composite one, being Demosthenes’ from the top of the forehead to the mouth, and Lord Brougham’s from the mouth to the chin.It is not impossible that he was wrong; but he would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a man of great eloquence.He had an absolute passion for oratory, and could not refrain from display.For example, he used to leap upon the dinner-table thus, and—and—”"
"这时，他旁边的一位朋友把一只手搭在他的肩头，对他耳语了几句，他猛然止住话题，跌坐回了椅子上。","Here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear, upon which he ceased talking with great suddenness, and sank back within his chair."
"“还有，”刚才低声耳语的那位朋友说，“还有布拉尔，那个陀螺。我叫他陀螺，事实上是因为他满脑子都是那个古怪有趣而又并非不合逻辑的奇想，认为自己被变成了一只陀螺。您要是看到他旋转的样子一定会乐得呵呵大笑的。他会一小时一小时地单脚旋转，就像这样——这样——”","“And then,” said the friend who had whispered, “there was Boullard, the tee-totum.I call him the tee-totum because, in fact, he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet, that he had been converted into a tee-totum.You would have roared with laughter to see him spin.He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this manner—so—”"
"这时，刚才被他耳语打断的那位朋友，用同样的方式阻止了他。","Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper, performed an exactly similar office for himself."
"“可是，”一位老太太扯着嗓子喊道，“您的布拉尔先生是个疯子，充其量是个非常傻的疯子。请允许我问一句，有谁听说过人形陀螺？这事就是荒唐。茹瓦塞夫人就要更理性些，这您知道。她有一个怪念头，但那念头是一种合乎情理的本能，并且给每一个有幸与她结识的人都带来快乐。经过再三考虑，她发现自己被意外地变成了小公鸡，但是，作为小公鸡，她的行为举止中规中矩。她扇动翅膀的架势非常奇妙——就像这样——这样——而她打鸣的声音，也特别悦耳动听！喔喔—喔！——喔喔—喔！——喔喔—喔—喔—喔喔—喔—喔—喔！”","“But then,” cried the old lady, at the top of her voice, “your Monsieur Boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at best; for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum?The thing is absurd.Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person, as you know.She had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common sense, and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance.She found, upon mature deliberation, that, by some accident, she had been turned into a chicken-cock; but, as such, she behaved with propriety.She flapped her wings with prodigious effect—so—so—and, as for her crow, it was delicious!Cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-de-doo-dooo-do-o-o-o-o-o-o!”"
"“茹瓦塞夫人，请您注意自己的言行！” 这时，我们的主人非常生气地打断了她。","“Madame Joyeuse, I will thank you to behave yourself!” here interrupted our host, very  angrily. "
"“您要么像位夫人一样举止端庄，要么马上离开餐桌——您自己选择吧。”","“You can either conduct yourself as a lady should do, or you can quit the table forthwith—take your choice.”"
"听到主人叫她茹瓦塞夫人，我很是惊讶，她刚刚描述的女人就叫这个名字。而那位夫人满脸通红，似乎对这样的指责感到极度窘迫。她耷拉下脑袋，再没吭一声。但是另一个年轻点的女士接过了话题。她就是我在小接待室见到的那位美丽的姑娘。","The lady (whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame Joyeuse, after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just given) blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof.She hung down her head, and said not a syllable in reply.But another and younger lady resumed the theme.It was my beautiful girl of the little parlor."
"“噢，茹瓦塞夫人是个傻子！”她喊道，“不过，欧仁妮·萨尔萨菲特的看法，倒的确有很多合理的地方。她是个美丽迷人、非常谦逊的年轻女士。她认为普通的着装方式有伤风化，并且希望穿衣服时身子露在衣服外面，而不是裹在衣服里。这其实是件很容易做到的事。您只需要这样——然后这样——这样——这样——然后这样——这样——这样——然后这样——然后这样——”","“Oh, Madame Joyeuse was a fool!” she exclaimed, “but there was really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugenie Salsafette.She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes.It is a thing very easily done, after all.You have only to do so—and then so—so—so—and then so—so—so—and then so—so—and then—"
"“天啊！萨尔萨菲特小姐！”十几个声音同时喊道。“您想干什么？——停住！——够了！——我们看清怎么做了，非常清楚！——停下来！停下来！”几个人已经从座位上跳起来，阻止萨尔萨菲特小姐把自己脱成美第奇的维纳斯的模样。这时，城堡主楼的某个部分传来一阵阵震耳的惊叫或呼喊，这迅速、有效地制止了萨尔萨菲特小姐的行为。","“Mon dieu! Ma’m’selle Salsafette!” here cried a dozen voices at once.“What are you about?—forbear!—that is sufficient!—we see, very plainly, how it is done!—hold! hold!”and several persons were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma’m’selle Salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean Venus, when the point was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud screams, or yells, from some portion of the main body of the chateau."
"说真的，我的神经受到了这呼喊的强烈刺激；不过我真是可怜餐厅里的其他人。我一生中从未见过一群理性的人被吓得如此狼狈。他们的脸色全都变得煞白，像死尸一样，一个个蜷缩在座位上，吓得浑身发抖，语无伦次，等着那声音再次响起。叫喊声果然又出现了——比刚才更响亮也更近了——随之，第三次响声接踵而至，声震如雷，随后又传来了第四次，但力量明显减弱了。随着叫喊声的逐渐消失，这群人立即恢复了生气，又像刚才那样兴高采烈地谈论起奇闻轶事。这时，我冒昧地问起这阵骚动的原因。","My nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but the rest of the company I really pitied.I never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life.They all grew as pale as so many corpses, and, shrinking within their seats, sat quivering and gibbering with terror, and listening for a repetition of the sound.It came again—louder and seemingly nearer—and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished.At this apparent dying away of the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained, and all was life and anecdote as before.I now ventured to inquire the cause of the disturbance."
"“一个小插曲而已。”马亚尔先生回答道，“我们已经习以为常，很少在乎这种事情了。那些疯子们时不时会齐声嚎叫一番，一个人叫，其他人就应和成一片，就像有时候夜里一群狗突然狂吠一样。不过，有时在这种齐声嚎叫之后，病人们会协力挣脱监禁，那时，当然呢，恐怕就会有些小危险。”","“A mere bagtelle,” said Monsieur Maillard.“We are used to these things, and care really very little about them.The lunatics, every now and then, get up a howl in concert; one starting another, as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at night.It occasionally happens, however, that the concerto yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose, when, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.”"
"“那您现在负责多少病人？”","“And how many have you in charge?”"
"“目前我们总共有不超过十个病人。”","“At present we have not more than ten, altogether.”"
"“主要都是女性吧，我想？”","“Principally females, I presume?”"
"“哦，不是——全都是男的，还都是强壮的汉子，我可以肯定地说。”","“Oh, no—every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell you.”"
"“真的吗！我一直以为大多数疯子都是女性。”","“Indeed! I have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of the gentler sex.”"
"“一般来说是这样，但并不总是如此。曾有一段时间，这里有大约二十七个病人，其中女的就多达十八个。但是，最近，正像您所看到的，情况有了很大改变。”","“It is generally so, but not always.Some time ago, there were about twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less than eighteen were women; but, lately, matters have changed very much, as you see.”"
"“是啊——有了很大改变，正像您所看到的。”这时，刚才踢坏拉普拉斯小姐小腿的那位先生插话了。","“Yes—have changed very much, as you see,” here interrupted the gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma’m’selle Laplace."
"“是啊——有了很大改变，正像您所看到的！”整群人立刻响应道。","“Yes—have changed very much, as you see!” chimed in the whole company at once. "
"“都给我管住自己的舌头，一个都不例外！”我的主人狂怒不已。","“Hold your tongues, every one of you!” said my host, in a great rage."
"于是，在将近一分钟的时间里，满屋的人都陷入了死一般的沉寂。有一位女士，一字不落地执行了马亚尔先生的命令。她伸出特别长的舌头，顺从地用两只手握住，直到宴会结束。","Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute.As for one lady, she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to the letter, and thrusting out her tongue, which was an excessively long one, held it very resignedly, with both hands, until the end of the entertainment."
"“这位女士，”我探过身子，低声对马亚尔先生说，“这位刚刚说完话，给我们表演‘喔—喔—喔’的善良的夫人，我想，她没有危险——一点危险都没有，是吧？”","“And this gentlewoman,” said I, to Monsieur Maillard, bending over and addressing him in a whisper—“this good lady who has just spoken, and who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo—she, I presume, is harmless—quite harmless, eh?”"
"“没有危险！”他一脸的惊讶，突然喊道，“您——您什么意思嘛？”","“Harmless!” ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, “why—why, what can you mean?”"
"“只是稍微有些失常吗？”我问道，一边用手碰碰自己的脑袋。","“Only slightly touched?” said I, touching my head.  "
"“我可以认为，她的病不算特别危险，是吧？”","“I take it for granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected, eh?”"
"“我的天啊！ 您在胡思乱想些什么呀？这位夫人，我特别的老朋友乐茹瓦塞夫人，精神绝对正常，就像我一样。当然，她的确有些小怪癖——但是，您知道，所有上了年纪的女人——所有年迈的女人——或多或少都有些古怪！”","“Mon dieu! what is it you imagine?This lady, my particular old friend Madame Joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself.She has her little eccentricities, to be sure—but then, you know, all old women—all very old women—are more or less eccentric!”"
"“当然，”我说，“当然——那其他这些女士和先生们——”","“To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure—and then the rest of these ladies and gentlemen—”"
"“都是我的朋友和看护，”马亚尔先生打断了我，傲慢地挺直身子，“都是我非常好的朋友和助手。”","“Are my friends and keepers,” interupted Monsieur Maillard, drawing himself up with hauteur,—“my very good friends and assistants.”"
"“什么！他们都是？”我问道，“连女人也是吗？”","“What! all of them?” I asked,—“the women and all?”"
"“的确如此，”他说，“没有这些女人，我们简直没法工作，她们是世界上最好的精神病护士；她们有自己的一套办法，您知道；她们明亮的眼睛有着神奇的作用——有点像蛇的震慑力，您知道。”","“Assuredly,” he said,—“we could not do at all without the women; they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of their own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous effect;—something like the fascination of the snake, you know.”"
"“当然，”我说，“当然！她们的举止有些古怪，是吧？她们有点儿失常，是吧？难道您不这么认为？”","“To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure!They behave a little odd, eh?—they are a little queer, eh?—don’t you think so?”"
"“古怪！——失常！——怎么，您真这么认为？当然，在我们南方，我们不是特别讲究规矩——我们怎么高兴怎么来——享受生活，诸如此类，这您知道——”","“Odd!—queer!—why, do you really think so?We are not very prudish, to be sure, here in the South—do pretty much as we please—enjoy life, and all that sort of thing, you know—”"
"“当然，”我说，“当然。”","“To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure.”"
"“还有呢，可能这伏旧园葡萄酒有点上头，您知道——有些烈——您明白，对吧？”","“And then, perhaps, this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady, you know—a little strong—you understand, eh?”"
"“当然，”我说，“当然。顺便问问，先生，您是不是说，您现在采取的用以取代著名的抚慰疗法的方法，是非常苛刻、严厉的？”","“To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure.By the bye, Monsieur, did I understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous severity?”"
"“根本不是。我们有必要采取严格的监禁措施。但我们的治疗——我指的是医疗——对病人而言却是再合适不过了。”","“By no means.Our confinement is necessarily close; but the treatment—the medical treatment, I mean—is rather agreeable to the patients than otherwise.”"
"“这种新疗法是您自己发明的吗？”","“And the new system is one of your own invention?”"
"“不全是。其中有些部分归功于塔尔教授（注：‘塔尔’在英语中指‘涂上焦油’），对他您必然有所耳闻。另外，对于我的方案中的一些修正——我很高兴地告诉您——得益于知名的费斯尔（注：在英语中，‘费斯尔’的发音与‘羽毛’类似），如果我没弄错的话，您一定有幸与他熟识。”","“Not altogether.Some portions of it are referable to Professor Tarr, of whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the celebrated Fether, with whom, if I mistake not, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance.”"
"“非常惭愧，”我回答道，“这两位先生的名字，之前我甚至一个也没听说过。”","“I am quite ashamed to confess,” I replied, “that I have never even heard the names of either gentleman before.”"
"“天啊！”我的主人惊呼道，他突然把椅子往后一推，举起双手。“我一定是听错了！","“Good heavens!” ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair abruptly, and uplifting his hands.“I surely do not hear you aright!"
"您不会是想说，您从未听说过博学的塔尔博士和著名的费斯尔教授吧？”","You did not intend to say, eh? that you had never heard either of the learned Doctor Tarr, or of the celebrated Professor Fether?”"
"“我不得不承认我的孤陋寡闻。”我回答道，“不过，事实高于一切，不可更改。但对于这些无疑是杰出人物的著作我竟然一无所知，实在是羞愧得无地自容。我会立刻找来他们的著作，潜心拜读。马亚尔先生，您真是——我必须承认——您真是——让我汗颜！”","“I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,” I replied; “but the truth should be held inviolate above all things.Nevertheless, I feel humbled to the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of these, no doubt, extraordinary men.I will seek out their writings forthwith, and peruse them with deliberate care.Monsieur Maillard, you have really—I must confess it—you have really—made me ashamed of myself!”"
"确实如此。","And this was the fact."
"“不要再说了，我的善良的年轻朋友。”他握了握我的手，和蔼地说，“和我一起喝一杯苏特恩白葡萄酒吧。“","“Say no more, my good young friend,” he said kindly, pressing my hand,—“join me now in a glass of Sauterne.”"
"我们举杯共饮。其他人也都毫无节制地效仿我们。他们聊天——他们开玩笑——他们开怀大笑——他们做出许许多多荒诞不经的事情——琴声刺耳——鼓声喧嚣——长号轰鸣，就像许多法拉里斯铜牛发出的声音——随着酒精逐渐支配了人的神经，整个场面变得越来越混乱，最后简直就成了地狱一般。与此同时，就着几瓶苏特恩白葡萄酒和伏旧园葡萄酒，马亚尔先生和我扯着嗓子继续我们的谈话。如果用普通的音调说话，那就如同尼亚加拉瀑布下面的一条鱼发出的声音，谁也无法听清楚。","We drank.The company followed our example without stint.They chatted—they jested—they laughed—they perpetrated a thousand absurdities—the fiddles shrieked—the drum row-de-dowed—the trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris—and the whole scene, growing gradually worse and worse, as the wines gained the ascendancy, became at length a sort of pandemonium in petto.In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard and myself, with some bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us, continued our conversation at the top of the voice.A word spoken in an ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish from the bottom of Niagra Falls."
"“先生，”我冲着他的耳朵喊道，“您吃饭前曾提到以前的抚慰疗法招致的危险。那是怎么回事？”","“And, sir,” said I, screaming in his ear, “you mentioned something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing.How is that?”"
"“是的，”他回答说，“有时候的确会有很大的危险。疯子的反复无常是无法解释的。不仅是我这样认为，这也是塔尔博士和费斯尔教授的观点，允许疯子们不加看管地随意乱跑是绝对不安全的。在一段时间里，一个疯子可能会得到‘抚慰’，但最后，他很有可能变得无法管束。总所周知，他是非常狡猾的。如果他心里盘算着什么，他会非常巧妙地隐藏自己的计划。而他用来假装正常的机敏，是精神疗法家们在精神领域研究中遇到的最奇特的问题之一。的确，如果一个疯子看上去神志完全正常，就该立刻给他套上约束衣。”","“Yes,” he replied, “there was, occasionally, very great danger indeed.There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and, in my opinion as well as in that of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether, it is never safe to permit them to run at large unattended.A lunatic may be ‘soothed,’ as it is called, for a time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become obstreperous.His cunning, too, is proverbial and great.If he has a project in view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of mind.When a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high time to put him in a straitjacket.”"
"“但是，我亲爱的先生，就您刚才所言，您亲身经历过的危险——就是在您负责这家疯人院期间遇到的危险——有没有给您切实的理由，让您认为，对一个疯子而言，自由是危险的？”","“But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your own experience—during your control of this house—have you had practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic?”"
"“在这里？我亲身经历过？嗯，我可以说，有的。比如，就在不久以前，就在这家疯人院，发生了一件非同寻常的事。‘抚慰疗法’，您知道，当时正在实施中，病人们都不受管束。他们的举止非常规矩——特别规矩。看到那些家伙们表现得如此好，任何一个神志正常的人都会知道这个特别的现象背后酝酿着某个险恶的阴谋。的确如此，一个晴朗的早晨，看护们发现自己被捆住手脚，投进了监禁室。在那里他们被那些疯子们当成疯子一样看护着。疯子们篡夺了看护的职权。”","“Here?—in my own experience?—why, I may say, yes.For example:—no very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this very house.The ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in operation, and the patients were at large.They behaved remarkably well—especially so, any one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact, that the fellows behaved so remarkably well.And, sure enough, one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had usurped the offices of the keepers.”"
"“这太令人难以置信了！我还从未听说过这么荒唐的事情！”","“You don’t tell me so! I never heard of any thing so absurd in my life!”"
"“这是事实——这一切之所以发生都是因为一个愚蠢的家伙——一个疯子——他不知怎么搞的，冒出这么个念头，认为自己想出了一个闻所未闻的好的管理办法——我是说管理疯子。我想，他希望尝试一下他的新方法，于是便说服其他病人参与他的阴谋，一起推翻管制力量。”","“Fact—it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow—a lunatic—who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before—of lunatic government, I mean.He wished to give his invention a trial, I suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers.”"
"“那他真的成功了？”","“And he really succeeded?”"
"“一点没错。看护者和被看护者很快就被调换位置。这么说也不准确——因为疯子以前是自由的，但是现在看护随即就被关进了监禁室，并且受到，我很遗憾地说，非常傲慢的对待。”","“No doubt of it.The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places.Not that exactly either—for the madmen had been free, but the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I am sorry to say, in a very cavalier manner.”"
"“但是我想这次‘革命’很快就平息下去了。这种局面不可能维持很长时间。周围的村民们——来院里参观的人们——一定会报警。”","“But I presume a counter-revolution was soon effected.This condition of things could not have long existed.The country people in the neighborhood—visitors coming to see the establishment—would have given the alarm.”"
"“这您就错了。带头叛乱的那个人非常狡猾，他不会让这样的事发生。他根本不许任何人进来参观——只有一次例外。一天，他准许一个看上去非常愚蠢的年轻绅士进入医院，他没有理由害怕这个年轻人。他让那年轻人进来参观——只是为了换换花样——拿他找点小乐子而已。他一捉弄够了年轻人，就马上让他离开，把他打发走了。”","“There you are out.The head rebel was too cunning for that.He admitted no visitors at all—with the exception, one day, of a very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid.He let him in to see the place—just by way of variety,—to have a little fun with him.As soon as he had gammoned him sufficiently, he let him out, and sent him about his business.”"
"“那么，疯子们统治医院有多长时间？”","“And how long, then, did the madmen reign?”"
"“哦，很长时间，真的——肯定有一个月——具体有多久，我说不准。在此期间，疯子们过得非常惬意——这点您可以相信。他们脱掉自己的破烂衣服，擅自穿着家居服装，佩戴起珠宝首饰。城堡的地窖里贮存着许多酒，而这些疯子正是些贪恋美酒的魔鬼。他们过得非常好，我敢肯定。”","“Oh, a very long time, indeed—a month certainly—how much longer I can’t precisely say.In the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly season of it—that you may swear.They doffed their own shabby clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels.The cellars of the chateau were well stocked with wine; and these madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it.They lived well, I can tell you.”"
"“那治疗呢——反叛者的首领具体实施了怎样的治疗方案呢？”","“And the treatment—what was the particular species of treatment which the leader of the rebels put into operation?”"
"“哦，关于这个，疯子并不一定就是傻子，这点我已经说过了。我坦率地说，新的治疗方法比旧有的方法要好得多。这的确是一个极佳的疗法——简单——利落——根本没有麻烦——事实上，这种疗法令人愉悦，让人——”","“Why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as I have already observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better treatment than that which it superseded.It was a very capital system indeed—simple—neat—no trouble at all—in fact it was delicious it was—”"
"这时，又一阵叫喊打断了主人的话。这阵叫喊和刚才使我们惊慌失措的叫喊有着相同的特征。不过，发出这次的声音的人似乎在快速向这里逼近。","Here my host’s observations were cut short by another series of yells, of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us.This time, however, they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching."
"“天啊！” 我突然喊道，“疯子们肯定挣脱了。”","“Gracious heavens!” I ejaculated—“the lunatics have most undoubtedly broken loose.”"
"“恐怕情况的确如此。”马亚尔先生回答道，脸色变得惨白。 他一句话还没来得及说完，窗下就传来了巨大的喊叫声和咒骂声。片刻之后，情况愈发明朗，外面有一些人正竭力要闯进来。听起来他们像是用大锤在用力砸门，百叶窗被人拼命地扭动、摇晃着。","“I very much fear it is so,” replied Monsieur Maillard, now becoming excessively pale.He had scarcely finished the sentence, before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows; and, immediately afterward, it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room.The door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge-hammer, and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence."
"随即最可怕的混乱景象出现了。马亚尔先生一头钻进餐具柜下，这令我大吃一惊。我原以为他能当机立断。乐队成员在过去的十五分钟里，似乎已经醉得一塌糊涂，已经无法演奏下去，现在他们都一跃而起，将乐器踩在脚下。他们爬上桌子，异口同声地唱起了《扬基歌》，在整场骚乱中，他们一直在表演，虽说调子不是很准，但他们的劲头绝对超乎常人。","A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued.Monsieur Maillard, to my excessive astonishment, threw himself under the side-board.I had expected more resolution at his hands.The members of the orchestra, who, for the last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty, now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments, and, scrambling upon their table, broke out, with one accord, into, “Yankee Doodle,” which they performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an energy superhuman, during the whole of the uproar."
"与此同时，那个刚才费了好大劲才克制着没有跳上餐桌的绅士，跃上了主餐桌，踩在一堆瓶子和杯子间。他刚一站稳，就开始演说起来，要是有人能够听到的话，那绝对是一篇精彩无比的演说。同时，那位陀螺爱好者开始绕着屋子强力旋转起来，他双臂张开，与身体垂直，看起来像极了一只陀螺，撞倒了挡在他旋转线路上的每一个人。接着，我还难以置信地听到了香槟酒瓶塞“砰”地拔出、嘶嘶冒泡的声音，过了半天我才发现，是那个在席间模仿这种优雅饮品的人发出了这种声音。还有，那个青蛙人呱呱叫着跑开了，就好像他的灵魂是否得救要取决于他所发出的每一声蛙鸣一样。在这一片混乱中，响起了一头驴子持续的叫声，压过了一切。至于我的老朋友，茹瓦塞夫人，我真该为这个可怜的女士掉眼泪，她看上去极度茫然。她只是站在壁炉旁的一个角落里，扯着嗓子不停地打鸣：“喔—喔—喔—喔喔喔！”","Meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and glasses, leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been restrained from leaping there before.As soon as he fairly settled himself, he commenced an oration, which, no doubt, was a very capital one, if it could only have been heard.At the same moment, the man with the teetotum predilection, set himself to spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and with arms outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that happened to get in his way.And now, too, hearing an incredible popping and fizzing of champagne, I discovered at length, that it proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner.And then, again, the frog-man croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every note that he uttered.And, in the midst of all this, the continuous braying of a donkey arose over all.As for my old friend, Madame Joyeuse, I really could have wept for the poor lady, she appeared so terribly perplexed.All she did, however, was to stand up in a corner, by the fireplace, and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice, “Cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!”"
"高潮随之而来——整出剧彻底失败了。由于对屋外的那伙人的侵犯，人除了叫呀、喊啊，或是像鸡一样打鸣，没有做任何其他抵抗，转瞬间，十扇窗户几乎同时被撞开。我永远也忘不了我当时惊奇与恐惧交织的心情。我目瞪口呆地看着一群在我眼里就是小人猿、黑猩猩，或是好望角的大黑狒狒的人跳过窗户，在我们中间横冲直撞、连打带踩、连抓带吼。","And now came the climax—the catastrophe of the drama.As no resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was offered to the encroachments of the party without, the ten windows were very speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in.But I shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which I gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down among us pele-mele, fighting, stamping, scratching, and howling, there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be Chimpanzees, Ourang-Outangs, or big black baboons of the Cape of Good Hope."
"我被痛打了一顿——随后便滚到一张沙发下，一动不动地躺着。我躺了有十五分钟，一边竖起耳朵仔细听着屋子里的一切动静。最后，我对这场悲剧有了一个满意的解释。看来，马亚尔先生给我讲述那个鼓动同伴造反的疯子，实际上不过是在说他自己的英勇事迹。的确，这位先生，在大约两三年前，曾经是这里的院长，但后来他自己也疯了，成了一个病人。这个事实是给我引见的那个旅伴所不知道的。看护们，总共十人，突然被制服后，先是被浑身涂满焦油，然后被仔细地粘上羽毛，关进地下禁闭室。他们就这样被囚禁了一个多月。在此期间，马亚尔先生不仅慷慨地给他们焦油和羽毛（这是他“疗法”的组成部分），还给他们一些面包和充足的水。水是每天用水泵冲到他们身上的。终于，一个人通过下水道逃了出来，解救了其他人。","I received a terrible beating—after which I rolled under a sofa and lay still.After lying there some fifteen minutes, during which time I listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room, I came to some satisfactory denouement of this tragedy.Monsieur Maillard, it appeared, in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion, had been merely relating his own exploits.This gentleman had, indeed, some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the establishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient.This fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me.The keepers, ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered, were first well tarred, then—carefully feathered, and then shut up in underground cells.They had been so imprisoned for more than a month, during which period Monsieur Maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers (which constituted his “system”), but some bread and abundance of water.The latter was pumped on them daily.At length, one escaping through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest."
"“抚慰疗法”在进行了重大修改后，在这个城堡里重新得以实施。不过我不得不同意马亚尔先生的看法，即，他自己的“疗法”是同类疗法中最好的。他的评价很公正，这种疗法“简单——利落——根本没有麻烦——一点也没有。”","The “soothing system,” with important modifications, has been resumed at the chateau; yet I cannot help agreeing with Monsieur Maillard, that his own “treatment” was a very capital one of its kind.As he justly observed, it was “simple—neat—and gave no trouble at all—not the least.”"
"我需要补充的仅有一点，尽管我遍访欧洲所有的图书馆查找塔尔博士和费斯尔教授的著作，但迄今为止，我的一切努力都是徒劳，一本也没找到。","I have only to add that, although I have searched every library in Europe for the works of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, I have, up to the present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at procuring an edition."
