		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛莎·米查姆小姐在街角经营了一家小型面包店（店门口有三个台阶，当你走上台阶，推门进去时，你能听到门铃叮当作响）。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Martha Meacham kept the little bakery on the corner (the one where you go up three steps, and the bell tinkles when you open the door).</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛莎小姐四十岁，她的银行账户里有两千美元的存款，她还有两颗假牙和一颗怜爱之心。与玛莎小姐相比，不少女人结婚的机会十分渺茫，但她们却都已经结婚了。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Martha was forty, her bank-book showed a credit of two thousand dollars, and she possessed two false teeth and a sympathetic heart.Many people have married whose chances to do so were much inferior to Miss Martha’s.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一个顾客，每个星期都会来两三次，渐渐地，玛莎小姐对他产生了兴趣。他是个中年男子，戴副眼镜，棕色的胡子被仔细地修剪过。</td>
		<td class="en">Two or three times a week a customer came in  in whom she began to take an interest.He was a middle-aged man, wearing spectacles and a brown beard trimmed to a careful point.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他说英语时带着很重的德国口音。他的衣服有些地方磨破了，经过修补，其他地方也是皱皱巴巴、松松垮垮的。但他看上去干净整洁，还很懂礼貌。</td>
		<td class="en">He spoke English with a strong German accent.His clothes were worn and darned in places, and wrinkled and baggy in others.But he looked neat, and had very good manners.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他总是会买两块陈面包。新出炉的面包要五分钱一块。陈面包两块才五分钱。他从来都只要陈面包。</td>
		<td class="en">He always bought two loaves of stale bread.Fresh bread was five cents a loaf.Stale ones were two for five.Never did he call for anything but stale bread.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一次，玛莎小姐看到他手指上有一块红棕色的污迹，于是她断定他是一个穷困的艺术家。</td>
		<td class="en">Once Miss Martha saw a red and brown stain on his fingers. She was sure then that he was an artist and very poor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >毋庸置疑，他住在一间阁楼里，在那里画着画，啃着陈面包，还会想着玛莎小姐面包店里好吃的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">No doubt he lived in a garret, where he painted pictures and ate stale bread and thought of the good things to eat in Miss Martha’s bakery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当玛莎小姐坐下来吃肉排、面包卷、果酱，喝茶的时候，她经常会叹息。她多希望那位举止得体的艺术家能来和她一起分享这些美食，而不是在那个冷风阵阵的阁楼里啃着干巴巴的面包。正如之前说过的那样，玛莎小姐有一副好心肠。</td>
		<td class="en">Often when Miss Martha sat down to her chops and light rolls and jam and tea she would sigh, and wish that the gentle-mannered artist might share her tasty meal instead of eating his dry crust in that draughty attic.Miss Martha’s heart, as you have been told, was a sympathetic one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了证实她对这位顾客职业的猜测，一天，她从房里拿出在商店打折时买的一幅画，摆在面包柜台后面的架子上。</td>
		<td class="en">In order to test her theory as to his occupation, she brought from her room one day a painting that she had bought at a sale, and set it against the shelves behind the bread counter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那是一幅威尼斯的风景画。一座壮丽的大理石宫殿（画上是这样注明的）立在前景处——确切地说是在前面的水景上。其余的部分画有几艘平底小船（一位妇人的手伸在水中），还有云彩、苍穹和好些忽明忽暗的炫彩。任何一位艺术家都会注意到这幅画的。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a Venetian scene.A splendid marble palazzio (so it said on the picture) stood in the foreground—or rather forewater.For the rest there were gondolas (with the lady trailing her hand in the water), clouds, sky, and chiaro-oscuro in plenty.No artist could fail to notice it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两天后，那位顾客又来了。</td>
		<td class="en">Two days afterward the customer came in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请帮我拿两块陈面包。</td>
		<td class="en">“Two loafs of stale bread, if you blease.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫人，您这幅画还不错。”当她把面包包起来时，他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“You haf here a fine bicture, madame,” he said while she was wrapping up the bread.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦？”玛莎小姐说，对自己的聪明十分得意，“我酷爱艺术和——绘画（不，这么早说“艺术家”有些不妥），”她改口说，“你觉得这幅画不错吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes?” says Miss Martha, revelling in her own cunning.“I do so admire art and” (no, it would not do to say “artists” thus early) “and paintings,” she substituted.“You think it is a good picture?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“布局比例，”这位顾客说，“不是很协调。透视关系也不对。回见了，夫人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Der balance,” said the customer, “is not in good drawing.Der bairspective of it is not true.Goot morning, madame.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他拿了面包，欠了下身便匆匆离开了。</td>
		<td class="en">He took his bread, bowed, and hurried out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >是的，他一定是一个艺术家。玛莎小姐把画又搬回了屋。</td>
		<td class="en">Yes, he must be an artist.Miss Martha took the picture back to her room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >透过眼镜，他的那双眼睛闪烁着多么温柔和亲切的目光啊！他的眉宇多宽啊！一眼就能判断出透视法——却靠着陈面包过活！但是，天才在被认可之前往往是要经历一番磨难的。</td>
		<td class="en">How gentle and kindly his eyes shone behind his spectacles!What a broad brow he had!To be able to judge perspective at a glance—and to live on stale bread!But genius often has to struggle before it is recognized.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果天才能够得到两千元的存款、一家面包店和一副好心肠作为后盾，那他的艺术和透视法该有多好的发展啊！——但是，玛莎小姐，这些都只是白日梦罢了。</td>
		<td class="en">What a thing it would be for art and perspective if genius were backed by two thousand dollars in bank, a bakery, and a sympathetic heart to—But these were day-dreams, Miss Martha.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在他每次来时，都会隔着柜台聊上一会儿。他似乎很渴望听到玛莎小姐愉快的话语。</td>
		<td class="en">Often now when he came he would chat for a while across the showcase.He seemed to crave Miss Martha’s cheerful words.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他还是一直买陈面包。从来不买蛋糕、馅饼，或者她可口的萨利伦甜饼。</td>
		<td class="en">He kept on buying stale bread.Never a cake, never a pie, never one of her delicious Sally Lunns.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她觉得他渐渐消瘦了，看上去还有些沮丧。她的心在痛。她多想在他买那些寒酸的东西时给他加一些好吃的东西啊，但她始终没有勇气做出行动。她不敢冒犯他。她清楚艺术家们的骄傲。</td>
		<td class="en">She thought he began to look thinner and discouraged.Her heart ached to add something good to eat to his meagre purchase, but her courage failed at the act.She did not dare affront him.She knew the pride of artists.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >柜台后的玛莎小姐开始穿那件蓝点子绸背心了。在后屋里，她熬制了一种神奇的榅桲籽和硼砂的混合物，很多人用它来改善肤色。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Martha took to wearing her blue-dotted silk waist behind the counter.In the back room she cooked a mysterious compound of quince seeds and borax.Ever so many people use it for the complexion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，那个顾客像往常一样走进店里，把五分硬币放在柜台上，依旧买陈面包。正当玛莎小姐伸手去拿面包的时候，外面发出了一阵很大的嘟声和叮当声，一辆消防车隆隆地驶过。</td>
		<td class="en">One day the customer came in as usual, laid his nickel on the showcase, and called for his stale loaves.While Miss Martha was reaching for them there was a great tooting and clanging, and a fire-engine came lumbering past.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很自然的，这位顾客急忙跑到门口去看。忽然，玛莎小姐灵光一现，把握住了这个机会。</td>
		<td class="en">The customer hurried to the door to look, as any one will.Suddenly inspired, Miss Martha seized the opportunity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在柜台后架子的底部有一磅新鲜黄油，是十分钟前送奶工留下的。玛莎小姐用切面包的刀在每块陈面包上都划了一道深深的口子，塞进很多黄油，然后把面包压紧。</td>
		<td class="en">On the bottom shelf behind the counter was a pound of fresh butter that the dairyman had left ten minutes before.With a bread knife Miss Martha made a deep slash in each of the stale loaves, inserted a generous quantity of butter, and pressed the loaves tight again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当顾客再一次进来的时候，她正在用纸把面包包起来。</td>
		<td class="en">When the customer turned once more she was tying the paper around them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在一段格外愉快的闲聊后，他走了。玛莎小姐暗自笑了笑，但心里多少还是有些忐忑。</td>
		<td class="en">When he had gone, after an unusually pleasant little chat, Miss Martha smiled to herself, but not without a slight fluttering of the heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是不是太大胆了？他会生气吗？不过肯定不会的。食物又不会说话。黄油也不是冒失不矜持的代名词。</td>
		<td class="en">Had she been too bold?Would he take offense?But surely not.There was no language of edibles.Butter was no emblem of unmaidenly forwardness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从那以后很长一段时间，她的心里老是惦记着那回事。她想象着当他发现了她的小计谋后的情景。</td>
		<td class="en">For a long time that day her mind dwelt on the subject.She imagined the scene when he should discover her little deception.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他将放下画笔和调色板。画架上是他正在创作的画，其中所运用的透视法是无可挑剔的。</td>
		<td class="en">He would lay down his brushes and palette.There would stand his easel with the picture he was painting in which the perspective was beyond criticism.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >或许他准备用干面包和清水来凑合一顿午餐。或许他在切一片面包——啊！</td>
		<td class="en">He would prepare for his luncheon of dry bread and water.He would slice into a loaf—ah!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛莎小姐脸红了。当他吃面包的时候会不会想到那个放黄油的人呢？他会不会——</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Martha blushed.Would he think of the hand that placed it there as he ate?Would he—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >前门的门铃发出了刺耳的响声。有人吵吵嚷嚷地进来了。</td>
		<td class="en">The front door bell jangled viciously.Somebody was coming in, making a great deal of noise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛莎小姐赶忙走上前去。来的是两个男人。年轻一点儿的叼着烟斗，这个人她之前从来没见过。另外一个就是她的艺术家了。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Martha hurried to the front.Two men were there.One was a young man smoking a pipe—a man she had never seen before.The other was her artist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他面红耳赤，帽子扣在后脑勺上，头发相当凌乱。他紧握双拳，狠狠地在玛莎小姐面前挥舞着。那可是玛莎小姐啊。</td>
		<td class="en">His face was very red, his hat was on the back of his head, his hair was wildly rumpled.He clinched his two fists and shook them ferociously at Miss Martha.At Miss Martha.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“笨蛋！”他声嘶力竭地叫嚷着，“简直是五雷轰顶！”他叫嚷着德语中诸如此类的话。</td>
		<td class="en">“Dummkopf!” he shouted with extreme loudness; and then “Tausendonfer!” or something like it in German.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个年轻人试图把他拉开。</td>
		<td class="en">The young man tried to draw him away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是不会走的，”他怒气冲冲地说，“我必须告诉她。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I vill not go,” he said angrily, “else I shall told her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他擂鼓般地敲着玛莎小姐的柜台。</td>
		<td class="en">He made a bass drum of Miss Martha’s counter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是你毁了我！”他喊叫着，镜框后的蓝眼睛闪着怒火。“我告诉你！你就是一个令人深恶痛绝的老太婆！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You haf shpoilt me,” he cried, his blue eyes blazing behind his spectacles.“I vill tell you.You vas von meddingsome old cat!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛莎小姐虚弱地倚靠在架子上，一只手搭在蓝点子绸背心上。那个年轻人抓住同伴的衣领。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Martha leaned weakly against the shelves and laid one hand on her blue-dotted silk waist.The young man took the other by the collar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好了。”他说，“你说的够多的了。”他把勃然大怒的同伴拉出门外，一直拽到人行道上，然后返了回来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Come on,” he said, “you’ve said enough.”He dragged the angry one out at the door to the sidewalk, and then came back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫人，我觉得我应该告诉你这场纷争是怎么回事，”他说，“他叫布卢姆伯格尔，是一个建筑绘图员。我们在同一家办公室工作。</td>
		<td class="en">“Guess you ought to be told, ma’am,” he said, “what the row is about.That’s Blumberger.He’s an architectural draftsman.I work in the same office with him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在为新的市政大厅绘制设计图，已经忙了三个月。这是一个有奖竞赛。昨天他刚给线条上完墨。你知道的，设计师总是先用铅笔打底稿，上好墨后，再用陈面包屑擦去铅笔印。相比弹性橡皮擦，陈面包要好用得多。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He’s been working hard for three months drawing a plan for a new city hall.It was a prize competition.He finished inking the lines yesterday.You know, a draftsman always makes his drawing in pencil first.When it’s done he rubs out the pencil lines with handfuls of stale bread crumbs.That’s better than India rubber.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“布卢姆伯格尔一直以来都是在你这儿买的面包，嗯，今天——嗯，你知道，夫人，那黄油不能——嗯，布卢姆伯格尔的设计图现在完全没有用了，只能裁开用来打包火车上卖的三明治了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Blumberger’s been buying the bread here.Well, to-day—well, you know, ma’am, that butter isn’t—well, Blumberger’s plan isn’t good for anything now except to cut up into railroad sandwiches.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛莎小姐走进后屋。她换下了蓝点子绸背心，重新穿上了那件旧的褐色粗纺哔叽。然后她把榅桲籽和硼砂的混合物倒进了窗外的垃圾箱里。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Martha went into the back room.She took off the blue-dotted silk waist and put on the old brown serge she used to wear.Then she poured the quince seed and borax mixture out of the window into the ash can.</td></tr>
