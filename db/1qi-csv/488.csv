"人生如戏","The Thing’s the Play"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"我与一个新闻记者很熟，他经常有一些免费票。前不久的一个晚上，我和他相约去看了一个很受欢迎的歌舞杂耍剧。","Being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of free passes, I got to see the performance a few nights ago at one of the popular vaudeville houses."
"有个节目是小提琴独奏，那个演员相貌十分惊世骇俗，年纪不到四十，头发浓密但已完全灰白。我没有音乐鉴赏力，所以我对那噪音般的音乐充耳不闻，只顾专心观察拉琴的人。","One of the numbers was a violin solo by a striking-looking man not much past forty, but with very gray thick hair.Not being afflicted with a taste for music, I let the system of noises drift past my ears while I regarded the man."
"“我们在一两个月前报道过这个家伙，”记者说道，“他们给我分配了这个任务。要求篇幅占够一栏，文笔要极其轻松幽默。我的老板似乎很欣赏我对本地新闻的幽默的处理方式。哦，对了，我目前正在写一篇关于滑稽喜剧的报道。我去剧院收集了所有的素材，但是，很明显，我没有完成任务。我回去之后而是上交了一篇报道城东一次葬礼的捧场文章。为什么呢？不知为何，我怎么都不能以幽默的方式来切入故事。也许你能根据这些素材写出一幕悲伤的开场剧。呆会儿我把素材给你。”","“There was a story about that chap a month or two ago,” said the reporter.“They gave me the assignment.It was to run a column and was to be on the extremely light and joking order.The old man seems to like the funny touch I give to local happenings.Oh, yes, I’m working on a farce comedy now.Well, I went down to the house and got all the details; but I certainly fell down on that job.I went back and turned in a comic write-up of an east side funeral instead.Why?Oh, I couldn’t seem to get hold of it with my funny hooks, somehow.Maybe you could make a one-act tragedy out of it for a curtain-raiser.I’ll give you the details.”"
"演出结束之后，我的这位记者朋友一边喝着维尔茨堡酒，一边给我讲述那些素材。","After the performance my friend, the reporter, recited to me the facts over the Würzburger."
"“我觉得利用这些素材写出一个极佳的幽默故事完全没问题啊。”听他讲完后，我说道，“如果他们三个是真实舞台上的真正演员，那么他们的表演是再可笑滑稽不过的了。在我看来，这个世界就是一个大舞台，所有的男男女女都是舞台上的演员。‘人生如戏，’我喜欢引用莎士比亚先生的这句话。”","“I see no reason,” said I, when he had concluded, “why that shouldn’t make a rattling good funny story.Those three people couldn’t have acted in a more absurd and preposterous manner if they had been real actors in a real theatre.I’m really afraid that all the stage is a world, anyhow, and all the players men and women.‘The thing’s the play,’ is the way I quote Mr. Shakespeare.”"
"“那你不妨试试。”记者说。","“Try it,” said the reporter."
"“我会的。”我答道。我也是这样么做的，为的是向他表明完全可以用这些素材为他的报纸写出一栏幽默作品。","“I will,” said I; and I did, to show him how he could have made a humorous column of it for his paper."
"阿宾顿广场附近有一栋房子。底层是一个有着二十五年历史的小商店，主要经营玩具、小杂货和文具。","There stands a house near Abingdon Square.On the ground floor there has been for twenty-five years a little store where toys and notions and stationery are sold."
"二十年前的一个晚上，这家小店的楼上举行了一场婚礼。寡妇梅奥是房子和店铺的主人。新娘是她的女儿海伦，新郎是弗兰克·巴里。伴郎是约翰·德莱尼。海伦十八岁时，有一次，她的照片被刊登在晨报上，旁边则是一则来自蒙大拿州比尤特、标题为“杀人无数的女凶手”的新闻。不过，在你的眼睛和智力排除两者的联系之后，你再拿起放大镜，仔细阅读照片下的文字，就会发现她被介绍是下西区有名的美女之一。","One night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms above the store.The Widow Mayo owned the house and store.Her daughter Helen was married to Frank Barry.John Delaney was best man.Helen was eighteen, and her picture had been printed in a morning paper next to the headlines of a “Wholesale Female Murderess” story from Butte, Mont.But after your eye and intelligence had rejected the connection, you seized your magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as one of a series of Prominent Beauties and Belles of the lower west side."
"弗兰克·巴里和约翰·德莱尼是该区“著名的”纨绔子弟，也是一对好朋友，是那种我们可以预料到——每当舞台幕布拉开，两人便开始互相抬杠的好朋友。把钱都花在音乐会和戏剧院的人经常看到这种情形。这是发生在这个故事的第一个幽默情节。他们俩都很努力地追求海伦。弗兰克追到海伦之后，约翰和他握了握手，恭喜了他——表现得很是真诚。","Frank Barry and John Delaney were “prominent” young beaux of the same side, and bosom friends, whom you expected to turn upon each other every time the curtain went up.One who pays his money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this.That is the first funny idea that has turned up in the story yet.Both had made a great race for Helen’s hand.When Frank won, John shook his hand and congratulated him—honestly, he did."
"婚礼结束之后，海伦上楼去拿帽子。她已经是结婚之后出门的装束了。她和弗兰克准备去老康福角呆上一星期。叽叽喳喳的居民都在楼下等着这对新人，手里拿着许多装着大米的纸袋子和一些旧靴子。","After the ceremony Helen ran upstairs to put on her hat.She was getting married in a traveling dress.She and Frank were going to Old Point Comfort for a week.Downstairs the usual horde of gibbering cave-dwellers were waiting with their hands full of old Congress gaiters and paper bags of hominy."
"防火梯上“咔嗒”一声，失魂落魄的约翰·德莱尼跳进了海伦的房间。一撮湿漉漉的头发无力地卷曲在他额前，他疯狂地、痴迷地向他失去的爱人示爱，乞求她能和他一起私奔去里维埃拉，或布朗克斯，或任何与意大利一样，有着明亮的天空及舒适生活的老地方去。","Then there was a rattle of the fire-escape, and into her room jumps the mad and infatuated John Delaney, with a damp curl drooping upon his forehead, and made violent and reprehensible love to his lost one, entreating her to flee or fly with him to the Riviera, or the Bronx, or any old place where there are Italian skies and dolce far niente."
"然而，使他难受的是海伦拒竟然绝了他。带着强烈鄙视的眼神，她责问他，对像她这样有名望的人说出这种话到底是什么意思。","It would have carried Blaney off his feet to see Helen repulse him.With blazing and scornful eyes she fairly withered him by demanding whatever he meant by speaking to respectable people that way."
"她让他立刻离开。他刚才的那股男子汉气概消失了。他低着头，说了一些“难以抵抗的冲动”和“永远不会忘”之类的话——她便建议他立刻从防火梯上跳下去。","In a few moments she had him going.The manliness that had possessed him departed.He bowed low, and said something about “irresistible impulse” and “forever carry in his heart the memory of”—and she suggested that he catch the first fire-escape going down."
"“我会离开，”约翰·德莱尼说，“我要到地球最远的地方去。一想到你已嫁作他人妇，我一秒也不想在这儿呆下去了。我要去非洲，为别的事情努力——”","“I will away,” said John Delaney, “to the furthermost parts of the earth.I cannot remain near you and know that you are another’s.I will to Africa, and there amid other scenes strive to for—” "
"“看在上帝的分上，出去吧，”海伦说道，“随时都可能有人进来。”","“For goodness sake, get out,” said Helen.“Somebody might come in.”"
"他单膝跪下，她伸出一只白皙的手，让他吻别。","He knelt upon one knee, and she extended him one white hand that he might give it a farewell kiss."
"姑娘们，这个选择是不是小爱神丘比特所赐的恩惠——让你爱的人对你忠贞不渝，让你不爱的人前额聋拉着一撮湿漉漉的头发跪在你面前，喋喋不休说着非洲和他心中永远不会凋零的爱情花？了解自己的能力，感受自己幸福处境的甜蜜的安全感，把不幸之人打发到外国去，让他彻底死心；而当他把最后一个吻留在你的手指上时，你则庆幸自己的指甲修剪得如此精致、整洁——姑娘们，这太棒了——千万别让这个机会从你身边溜走。","Girls, was this choice boon of the great little god Cupid ever vouchsafed you—to have the fellow you want hard and fast, and have the one you don’t want come with a damp curl on his forehead and kneel to you and babble of Africa and love which, in spite of everything, shall forever bloom, an amaranth, in his heart?To know your power, and to feel the sweet security of your own happy state; to send the unlucky one, broken-hearted, to foreign climes, while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss upon your knuckles, that your nails are well manicured—say, girls, it’s galluptious—don’t ever let it get by you."
"当然了，之后——你猜怎么着？——新郎推开门，大踏步走了进来，正巧看到约翰亲吻海伦手的一幕，嫉妒之火顿时在他胸中熊熊燃烧起来。","And then, of course—how did you guess it?—the door opened and in stalked the bridegroom, jealous of slow-tying bonnet strings."
"道别之吻还留在海伦的手上，约翰·德莱尼已跃起跳到窗外，顺着防火梯下去，前往非洲了。","The farewell kiss was imprinted upon Helen’s hand, and out of the window and down the fire-escape sprang John Delaney, Africa bound."
"麻烦来点儿轻音乐——微弱的小提琴声，轻柔地吹奏一下单簧管，再稍稍拉一下大提琴。想象一下当时的情景。弗兰克像受了致命伤似的大喊大叫，形势趋于白热化。海伦急忙跑过去拉住他，想要解释。他抓住她的手腕，把它们硬生生地从他肩膀上扯开——一次、两次、三次，就这样把她扭来扭去——戏剧导演会把动作演示给你看的——她终于被甩开了，蜷缩在地上呻吟着。他大声嚷嚷着以后再也不想看到她了，之后便冲了出去，留下一屋子口瞪目呆的宾客。","A little slow music, if you please—faint violin, just a breath in the clarinet and a touch of the ’cello.Imagine the scene.Frank, white-hot, with the cry of a man wounded to death bursting from him.Helen, rushing and clinging to him, trying to explain.He catches her wrists and tears them from his shoulders—once, twice, thrice he sways her this way and that—the stage manager will show you how—and throws her from him to the floor a huddled, crushed, moaning thing.Never, he cries, will he look upon her face again, and rushes from the house through the staring groups of astonished guests."
"因为这是人生而不是戏剧，观众必须在二十年的幕间休息中走进世界的真正的休息室，无一例外地结婚、死亡、衰老、富有、贫穷、快乐亦或惨淡，直到大幕重新拉开。","And, now because it is the Thing instead of the Play, the audience must stroll out into the real lobby of the world and marry, die, grow gray, rich, poor, happy or sad during the intermission of twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again."
"巴里太太继承了这家店铺和这栋房子。三十八岁时，她在选美比赛中的常识问答得分和整体印象战胜了许多十八岁的小姑娘。只有少数几个人还记得她的婚礼闹剧，但是她从不隐瞒。她没有用薰衣草或者樟脑丸将这件事密封，也没有把它当作素材卖给杂志。","Mrs. Barry inherited the shop and the house.At thirty-eight she could have bested many an eighteen-year-old at a beauty show on points and general results.Only a few people remembered her wedding comedy, but she made of it no secret.She did not pack it in lavender or moth balls, nor did she sell it to a magazine."
"一天，一个收入颇丰的中年律师隔着柜台向她求婚，这个律师经常在她店里买公文纸和墨水。","One day a middle-aged money-making lawyer, who bought his legal cap and ink of her, asked her across the counter to marry him."
"“我真的很感谢你，”海伦高兴地说，“但是二十年前我已经和另外一个男人结婚了。与其说他是个男人，不如说他是个傻瓜，但是我觉得我依然爱着他。婚礼结束半小时之后，我就再也没见过他了。你要买的是复写墨还是书写墨？”","“I’m really much obliged to you,” said Helen, cheerfully, “but I married another man twenty years ago.He was more a goose than a man, but I think I love him yet.I have never seen him since about half an hour after the ceremony.Was it copying ink that you wanted or just writing fluid?”"
"律师在柜台外面按照传统的礼节向她鞠了一躬，并在她的手背上礼貌地留下一个吻。海伦叹了口气。离别的礼节，无论多么浪漫，都有可能过火。如今的她虽已三十八岁，风韵犹存，爱慕者络绎不绝；但她从求婚者那得到的似乎只有责备和分手。更糟糕的是，最后一次她还失去了一个顾客。","The lawyer bowed over the counter with old-time grace and left a respectful kiss on the back of her hand.Helen sighed.Parting salutes, however romantic, may be overdone.Here she was at thirty-eight, beautiful and admired; and all that she seemed to have got from her lovers were approaches and adieus.Worse still, in the last one she had lost a customer, too."
"生意日渐冷清，她挂出了出租房屋的招牌。三楼的两间大房子都收拾好了，随时为合适的房客准备着。遗憾的是，看房的人来来去去，大都是因为巴里太太过整洁、舒适以及品味的要求太高。","Business languished, and she hung out a Room to Let card.Two large rooms on the third floor were prepared for desirable tenants.Roomers came, and went regretfully, for the house of Mrs. Barry was the abode of neatness, comfort and taste."
"一天，小提琴家拉蒙蒂过来租了楼上靠前的房间。住宅区的嘈杂喧嚣使他敏感的耳朵很不舒服。因此他的一个朋友向他介绍了这片处于噪音沙漠中的绿洲。","One day came Ramonti, the violinist, and engaged the front room above.The discord and clatter uptown offended his nice ear; so a friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert of noise."
"拉蒙蒂的相貌依旧年轻，眉毛浓黑，下巴上还有短而尖、棕色而赋有异国风情的络腮胡子。他那醒目的灰白头发和艺术家的气质——主要表现在他轻松愉快的处事方式上——使他成为阿宾顿广场这栋老房子里颇受欢迎的房客。","Ramonti, with his still youthful face, his dark eyebrows, his short, pointed, foreign, brown beard, his distinguished head of gray hair, and his artist’s temperament—revealed in his light, gay and sympathetic manner—was a welcome tenant in the old house near Abingdon Square."
"海伦住在店铺的楼上。房屋的建筑古朴而奇特。门厅很宽敞，差不多是个正方形。一段开放式的楼梯从门厅一端跨到另一端，直通楼上。她把这个门厅布置成起居室和办公室两用的地方。她在那里放了一张书桌，在上面书写商业信件；晚上她就坐在温暖的火炉旁，在明亮的红色灯光下做做针线活，或读读书。拉蒙蒂觉得这种气氛非常惬意，便也在那里打发时间，由于他曾在巴黎跟随一个赫赫有名的小提琴家学过小提琴，因此对巴黎也算了解，便向巴里太太讲述他在那里看到的美妙风光。","Helen lived on the floor above the store.The architecture of it was singular and quaint.The hall was large and almost square.Up one side of it, and then across the end of it ascended an open stairway to the floor above.This hall space she had furnished as a sitting room and office combined.There she kept her desk and wrote her business letters; and there she sat of evenings by a warm fire and a bright red light and sewed or read.Ramonti found the atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there, describing to Mrs. Barry the wonders of Paris, where he had studied with a particularly notorious and noisy fiddler."
"接着，第二个房客也来了，是位四十岁出头，非常帅气，却流露出忧郁气质的男人。他留着神秘的棕色胡子，还有一双大眼睛，充满了令人不解的、恳求的神情。他也发现与海伦交往非常悦人心意。他有罗密欧的眼神和奥赛罗的口才，向海伦讲诉一些发生在令她心驰神往的遥远国度的故事，并用尊重她的方式婉转地向她传递爱意。","Next comes lodger No. 2, a handsome, melancholy man in the early 40’s, with a brown, mysterious beard, and strangely pleading, haunting eyes.He, too, found the society of Helen a desirable thing.With the eyes of Romeo and Othello’s tongue, he charmed her with tales of distant climes and wooed her by respectful innuendo."
"从见到这个男人开始，她就很激动，这种感觉非常奇妙、强烈。他的嗓音很快就把她带回到了她年轻时的浪漫时光。这种感觉越来越强烈，她终于屈服了，直觉告诉她，他曾是那段浪漫时光的男主角。接着，以女人的推断（是的，女人有时候就这样），她跳过了三段论法、理论、逻辑，确信她的丈夫回来了。因为她从他的眼神里读出了爱，女人对此是绝不会搞错的；她还读出了无穷的悔恨与自责，这些都令她顿生怜悯之心，而她的怜悯正是杰克建立一个家庭所必不可少的条件。","From the first Helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the presence of this man.His voice somehow took her swiftly back to the days of her youth’s romance.This feeling grew, and she gave way to it, and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a factor in that romance.And then with a woman’s reasoning (oh, yes, they do, sometimes) she leaped over common syllogisms and theory, and logic, and was sure that her husband had come back to her.For she saw in his eyes love, which no woman can mistake, and a thousand tons of regret and remorse, which aroused pity, which is perilously near to love requited, which is the sine qua non in the house that Jack built."
"但是她不露声色。一个在外游荡了二十年之后再回家的丈夫不应该指望自己的拖鞋放在最方便的地方，也不应该指望有一根已经划好了的火柴等着点燃他的雪茄。而必须有赎罪、解释，甚至可能有来自于妻子的咒骂。必须有点儿小惩罚才行，如果他百依百顺，那么便可以考虑给他一把竖琴和一顶王冠。因此，她大可不必露出她已经知道或者猜到的样子。","But she made no sign.A husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his slippers laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted for his cigar.There must be expiation, explanation, and possibly execration.A little purgatory, and then, maybe, if he were properly humble, he might be trusted with a harp and crown.And so she made no sign that she knew or suspected."
"我的这位记者朋友却看不出这其中的幽默之所在！却还被派去写一篇热闹、精彩、有趣的文章——但是我不想找朋友的茬——我们还是继续讲故事吧。","And my friend, the reporter, could see nothing funny in this!Sent out on an assignment to write up a roaring, hilarious, brilliant joshing story of—but I will not knock a brother—let us go on with the story."
"一天晚上，拉蒙蒂又顺便去了趟海伦的起居室兼办公室，又以狂喜中的音乐家的柔情和热忱向她表达了爱慕之情。他的豪言壮语如同梦想家兼实干家心中圣火的闪耀的火苗。","One evening Ramonti stopped in Helen’s hall-office-reception-room and told his love with the tenderness and ardor of the enraptured artist.His words were a bright flame of the divine fire that glows in the heart of a man who is a dreamer and doer combined."
"“但是在你答复我之前，”不等她指责他的唐突，他马上又说，“我必须得告诉你，我能给你的只有‘拉蒙蒂’这个姓。这是我的经纪人给我起的。我不知道我是谁，也不知道我从哪里来。我能记起的第一件事就是当我睁开眼睛时，我就躺在医院里。当时我很年轻，在医院已经躺了好几个星期了。但是对于之前的事情丝毫没有印象。有人告诉我，我被发现躺在路边，头部受伤，然后被救护车送进了医院。他们以为我肯定是摔倒了，头碰到了石头上。没有任何东西能证明我的身份。我的记忆也一直没有恢复。出院之后，我就开始学习小提琴。我大获成功。巴里太太——我不知道你的名字——但是我爱你；从我见到你的第一眼开始就觉得你是这个世界上唯一适合我的女人——而且”——总之，他说了很多诸如此类的话。","“But before you give me an answer,” he went on, before she could accuse him of suddenness, “I must tell you that ‘Ramonti’ is the only name I have to offer you.My manager gave me that.I do not know who I am or where I came from.My first recollection is of opening my eyes in a hospital.I was a young man, and I had been there for weeks.My life before that is a blank to me.They told me that I was found lying in the street with a wound on my head and was brought there in an ambulance.They thought I must have fallen and struck my head upon the stones.There was nothing to show who I was.I have never been able to remember.After I was discharged from the hospital, I took up the violin.I have had success.Mrs. Barry—I do not know your name except that—I love you; the first time I saw you I realized that you were the one woman in the world for me—and”—oh, a lot of stuff like that."
"海伦仿佛又一次回到了年轻时候。首先，一阵带有自豪和虚荣的暖流流遍全身；接着，她盯着拉蒙蒂的眼睛，心里小鹿乱撞。她没想到自己这么激动。激动的连自己也觉得意外。这个音乐家已经成了她生命中重要的一部分，而她以前从来没意识到这一点。","Helen felt young again.First a wave of pride and a sweet little thrill of vanity went all over her; and then she looked Ramonti in the eyes, and a tremendous throb went through her heart.She hadn’t expected that throb.It took her by surprise.The musician had become a big factor in her life, and she hadn’t been aware of it."
"“拉蒙蒂先生，”她悲伤地（请记住，这不是在舞台上，而是阿宾顿广场附近的一座老房子里）说道，“我很遗憾，但我结过婚。”","“Mr. Ramonti,” she said sorrowfully (this was not on the stage, remember; it was in the old home near Abingdon Square), “I’m awfully sorry, but I’m a married woman.”"
"接着，她向他讲诉了自己悲惨的往事，因为故事里的女主角迟早是要讲的，不是告诉剧院经理，便是讲给记者听。","And then she told him the sad story of her life, as a heroine must do, sooner or later, either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter."
"拉蒙蒂拉住她的手，低下头吻了一下，起身回自己的房间去了。","Ramonti took her hand, bowed low and kissed it, and went up to his room."
"海伦坐下来，伤心地看着自己的手。她当然有伤心的理由。三个追求者吻过她的这只手，然后都骑着他们的红棕马扬长而去。","Helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand.Well she might.Three suitors had kissed it, mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away."
"一个小时之后，那个眼神幽怨而神秘的陌生人走了进来。海伦坐在藤条椅上，编织着一件没用的棉毛衣裳。他没有上楼，只是停下来聊了几句。他隔着桌子坐在她面前，也诉说了他对她的爱慕之情。然后，他说：“海伦，你不记得我了吗？我觉得我从你眼睛里已经看到了答案。你能原谅我过去的所作所为，重温我们持续了二十年的爱情吗？之前我做的事深深地伤害了你——我不敢回到你身边——但是我的情感压倒了理性。你能原谅我吗？你愿意原谅我吗？”","In an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes.Helen was in the willow rocker, knitting a useless thing in cotton-wool.He ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat.Sitting across the table from her, he also poured out his narrative of love.And then he said: “Helen, do you not remember me?I think I have seen it in your eyes.Can you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years?I wronged you deeply—I was afraid to come back to you—but my love overpowered my reason.Can you, will you, forgive me?”"
"海伦站了起来。这个神秘的陌生人紧紧地拉住她的一只手，不停地颤抖。","Helen stood up.The mysterious stranger held one of her hands in a strong and trembling clasp."
"她站在那里一动不动。我觉得舞台上不曾展现过她现在情感的场景真是相当遗憾。","There she stood, and I pity the stage that it has not acquired a scene like that and her emotions to portray."
"她站在那里，内心的两种感情在相互交织。一种是对她的新郎的初恋般纯洁难忘的爱；占据另一半心灵的是对她第一次做出选择的珍惜、神圣和对记忆的尊重之情。她更偏爱那种纯洁的感情。荣誉、信仰和甜蜜持久的浪漫史将她与这种感情联结在一起。但是她心灵的另一半则充满了另一种情感——一种后来发生的、更充实、更亲近的感情。因此，新欢与旧爱正进行着激烈的交锋。","For she stood with a divided heart.The fresh, unforgettable, virginal love for her bridegroom was hers; the treasured, sacred, honored memory of her first choice filled half her soul.She leaned to that pure feeling.Honor and faith and sweet, abiding romance bound her to it.But the other half of her heart and soul was filled with something else—a later, fuller, nearer influence.And so the old fought against the new."
"正当她犹豫不决的时候，楼上传来一阵轻柔、哀婉、令人焦灼的小提琴声。音乐这个巫婆可以让心灵最崇高的人都受到蛊惑。人们可能不去理会那些无关痛痒的人或物，但是耳膜的振动却与敏感的心相距更近。","And while she hesitated, from the room above came the soft, racking, petitionary music of a violin.The hag, music, bewitches some of the noblest.The daws may peck upon one’s sleeve without injury, but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum gets it not far from the neck."
"音乐和音乐家在召唤着她，名誉和旧爱又从后面拖拽着她。","This music and the musician caller her, and at her side honor and the old love held her back."
"“原谅我吧。”他恳求道。","“Forgive me,” he pleaded."
"“对你的爱人说你离开了二十年，这可不是一个短时间。”她强调，语气中似有涤罪的意味。","“Twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say you love,” she declared, with a purgatorial touch."
"“我该怎样说呢？”他乞求道，“现在我不想再对你有所隐瞒了。那天晚上，他走后，我一直跟着他。我已经被妒火烧昏了头。就在一条幽暗的街道上，我把他击倒了。他没有爬起来。我仔细看了一下。他的头撞到了一块石头上。我并不是有意要去杀他的。我只是被爱情和嫉妒冲昏了头。我藏在附近，看见一辆救护车把他带走了。尽管你和他结了婚，海伦——”","“How could I tell?” he begged.“I will conceal nothing from you.That night when he left I followed him.I was mad with jealousy.On a dark street I struck him down.He did not rise.I examined him.His head had struck a stone.I did not intend to kill him.I was mad with love and jealousy.I hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away.Although you married him, Helen—” "
"“你究竟是谁？”海伦瞪大眼睛，尖声问道，随即把手抽了回来。","“Who Are You?” cried the woman, with wide-open eyes, snatching her hand away."
"“你难道不记得我了吗，海伦？——一直最爱你的那个人啊。我是约翰·德莱尼。如果你能原谅我——”","“Don’t you remember me, Helen—the one who has always loved you best?I am John Delaney.If you can forgive—” "
"还没等他说完，海伦已经消失了，她三步并作两步、跌跌撞撞地冲上楼梯，奔向琴声和那个已经忘记她、但在两生中都把她视为最爱的人。她一面爬楼梯，一面哭泣着喊道：“弗兰克！弗兰克！弗兰克！”","But she was gone, leaping, stumbling, hurrying, flying up the stairs toward the music and him who had forgotten, but who had known her for his in each of his two existences, and as she climbed up she sobbed, cried and sang: “Frank!Frank!Frank!”"
"三个普通人就这样像台球弹子一样，与岁月不断纠缠碰撞。而我的那位记者朋友居然看不出这里面有什么滑稽之处！","Three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard balls, and my friend, the reporter, couldn’t see anything funny in it!"
