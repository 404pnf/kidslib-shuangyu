"老头子同盟","The League of the Old Men"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"兵营里一个人正在接受要被判死刑的审讯。他是个老头子，是当地的怀特菲什河人，那条河流入勒巴尔杰湖下游的育空河里。这件事轰动了整个道森，也震惊了育空河方圆千里的居民。在陆地上掠夺，在海洋上抢劫的盎格鲁萨克逊人一贯用法律统治被征服的民族，这种法律通常十分严酷。可是在英勃尔这件案子里，这种法律就第一次显得不适当和软弱无力了。单从数学方面的精准性上说，他要受的刑罚，远远抵不过他犯的罪。判刑是无可避免的结果，这毫无疑问；但是，尽管判的是死刑，英勃尔也只有一条命，而他的案子却牵涉到几十条人命。","At the Barracks a man was being tried for his life.He was an old man, a native from the Whitefish River, which empties into the Yukon below Lake Le Barge.All Dawson was wrought up over the affair, and likewise the Yukon-dwellers for a thousand miles up and down.It has been the custom of the land-robbing and sea-robbing Anglo-Saxon to give the law to conquered peoples, and ofttimes this law is harsh.But in the case of Imber the law for once seemed inadequate and weak.In the mathematical nature of things, equity did not reside in the punishment to be accorded him.The punishment was a foregone conclusion, there could be no doubt of that; and though it was capital, Imber had but one life, while the tale against him was one of scores."
"事实上，他手上沾满那么多人的鲜血，谁也算不准他到底杀了多少人。人们在路旁抽着烟斗或者围炉烤火的时候，曾经粗略地估计过命丧他手的人数。这些不幸被他杀掉的人，全是白人，其中有单个被杀的，也有一对对或一群群被杀的。这种毫无目的、毫无顾忌的谋杀，长期以来，对那些骑警来说都是一个谜，甚至在警察队长们扬威的时代也一样。后来，小河里发现矿产，从大英帝国自治领派来的总督要这一带的人为当地的繁荣纳税的时候，这个谜仍未解开。不过，更不可思议的是，英勃尔竟会到道森来自首。此时正值暮春，育空河水在冰层下咆哮翻腾，这个老印第安人从河面吃力地爬上岸来，站在大街上直眨眼睛。凡是亲眼看见他来的人，都注意到他身体虚弱，步履蹒跚，摇摇晃晃地走到一堆盖房子的木料跟前坐下。他在那里坐了一整天，一直盯着面前像川流不息的潮水般涌过的白人。很多人都好奇地扭过头，瞧他那目不转睛的眼神，对这个神情古怪的锡沃斯老头议论纷纷。无数的人后来还记得，他的奇特外表当时就吸引住了他们，以致后来他们还一直夸耀自己的敏锐目光，说他们能够认出不寻常的事物。","In fact, the blood of so many was upon his hands that the killings attributed to him did not permit of precise enumeration.Smoking a pipe by the trailside or lounging around the stove, men made rough estimates of the numbers that had perished at his hand.They had been whites, all of them, these poor murdered people, and they had been slain singly, in pairs, and in parties.And so purposeless and wanton had been these killings, that they had long been a mystery to the mounted police, even in the time of the captains, and later, when the creeks realized, and a governor came from the Dominion to make the land pay for its prosperity.But more mysterious still was the coming of Imber to Dawson to give himself up.It was in the late spring, when the Yukon was growling and writhing under its ice, that the old Indian climbed painfully up the bank from the river trail and stood blinking on the main street.Men who had witnessed his advent, noted that he was weak and tottery, and that he staggered over to a heap of cabin-logs and sat down.He sat there a full day, staring straight before him at the unceasing tide of white men that flooded past.Many a head jerked curiously to the side to meet his stare, and more than one remark was dropped anent the old Siwash with so strange a look upon his face.No end of men remembered afterward that they had been struck by his extraordinary figure, and forever afterward prided themselves upon their swift discernment of the unusual."
"不过，这一次的主角，还得让迪肯森，小迪肯森做。小迪肯森抱着极大的梦想，带着一口袋现款来到这片土地；但是，钱用完了，梦想也破灭了，为了赚一笔回美国的路费，他只好在霍尔布鲁克-梅森经纪行里当个办事员。英勃尔坐着的那堆木料，就放在这家经纪行办公室对面的街上。迪肯森出去吃午饭前透过窗户瞧见了他，等吃完午饭回来，他又向窗外瞧了瞧，那个锡沃斯老头仍旧在那里。","But it remained for Dickensen, Little Dickensen, to be the hero of the occasion.Little Dickensen had come into the land with great dreams and a pocketful of cash; but with the cash the dreams vanished, and to earn his passage back to the States he had accepted a clerical position with the brokerage firm of Holbrook and Mason.Across the street from the office of Holbrook and Mason was the heap of cabin-logs upon which Imber sat.Dickensen looked out of the window at him before he went to lunch; and when he came back from lunch he looked out of the window, and the old Siwash was still there."
"迪肯森不断地往窗户外面望，而且后来他也一直夸耀自己的目光敏锐。他是个爱幻想的小伙子，他把这个一动不动的老异教徒看作是锡沃斯族的化身，冷静地注视着那一群群入侵的萨克逊人。好几个钟头过去了，可是英勃尔并未改变姿势，仍旧丝毫不动；迪肯森于是想起了有一次，在人群往来不息的大街上，一个人直挺挺地坐在一架雪橇上。大伙儿以为这个人在休息，但后来他们碰了他一下，才发现他的身体僵硬又冰冷，他冻死在热闹的大街上了。为了把他弄直，好装进棺材，人们只好把他拖到一堆火旁边，给他化化冻。迪肯森一想起这件事就不由得打起寒颤。","Dickensen continued to look out of the window, and he, too, forever afterward prided himself upon his swiftness of discernment.He was a romantic little chap, and he likened the immobile old heathen to the genius of the Siwash race, gazing calm-eyed upon the hosts of the invading Saxon.The hours swept along, but Imber did not vary his posture, did not by a hair’s-breadth move a muscle; and Dickensen remembered the man who once sat upright on a sled in the main street where men passed to and fro.They thought the man was resting, but later, when they touched him, they found him stiff and cold, frozen to death in the midst of the busy street.To undouble him, that he might fit into a coffin, they had been forced to lug him to a fire and thaw him out a bit.Dickensen shivered at the recollection."
"后来，迪肯森走到外面人行道上抽了根雪茄，让头脑冷静冷静；过了没多久，埃米丽·特拉维斯碰巧从这里经过。埃米丽·特拉维斯是个优雅娇贵的绝色佳人。不论在伦敦还是在克朗代克，她都穿戴得合乎百万富翁金矿工程师女儿的身份。小迪肯森于是把他的雪茄烟放到路旁窗台上可以再找到的地方，向她行了个脱帽礼。","Later on, Dickensen went out on the sidewalk to smoke a cigar and cool off; and a little later Emily Travis happened along.Emily Travis was dainty and delicate and rare, and whether in London or Klondike she gowned herself as befitted the daughter of a millionnaire mining engineer.Little Dickensen deposited his cigar on an outside window ledge where he could find it again, and lifted his hat."
"他们聊了十分钟左右，埃米丽·特拉维斯朝迪肯森肩后望了一眼，吓得小声叫了起来。迪肯森转身一看，也吓了一跳。英勃尔已经穿过马路，站在那里，他身形消瘦，面带饥容，像一个影子，他的眼睛一动不动地盯着埃米丽。","They chatted for ten minutes or so, when Emily Travis, glancing past Dickensen’s shoulder, gave a startled little scream.Dickensen turned about to see, and was startled, too.Imber had crossed the street and was standing there, a gaunt and hungry-looking shadow, his gaze riveted upon the girl."
"“你想要干什么？”小迪肯森鼓足勇气，用颤抖的声音问。","“What do you want?”Little Dickensen demanded, tremulously plucky."
"英勃尔咕噜了几句，就昂首阔步地走到埃米丽·特拉维斯跟前。他把她从头到脚、仔仔细细地打量了一番，看得非常透彻。他好像对她那丝一般的褐发，以及她那微微泛红的、柔嫩的、好像蝴蝶翅膀上绒毛似的粉霜一样的脸的颜色特别感兴趣。他绕着她走，用审慎的目光观察她，仿佛在研究一匹马的身型或一条船的轮廓。正在他兜圈子的时候，老头子忽然看见夕阳照在她粉红色的耳朵上，于是他停下来，端详着她那透明的玫瑰色耳廓。接着，他又重新瞧着她的脸，长久而专注地看着她那双蓝眼睛。他咕哝了一句，用一只手抓住她的上臂。他用另一只手把她的前臂折上来。这时他脸上露出厌恶又惊讶的神情，随后便丢开那只胳膊，鄙视地哼了一声。然后，他嘟哝着发出几个喉音，转过身子，对迪肯森说起话来。","Imber grunted and stalked up to Emily Travis.He looked her over, keenly and carefully, every square inch of her.Especially did he appear interested in her silky brown hair, and in the color of her cheek, faintly sprayed and soft, like the downy bloom of a butterfly wing.He walked around her, surveying her with the calculating eye of a man who studies the lines upon which a horse or a boat is builded.In the course of his circuit the pink shell of her ear came between his eye and the westering sun, and he stopped to contemplate its rosy transparency.Then he returned to her face and looked long and intently into her blue eyes.He grunted and laid a hand on her arm midway between the shoulder and elbow.With his other hand he lifted her forearm and doubled it back.Disgust and wonder showed in his face, and he dropped her arm with a contemptuous grunt.Then he muttered a few guttural syllables, turned his back upon her, and addressed himself to Dickensen."
"迪肯森不明白他的话，埃米丽·特拉维斯笑了起来。英勃尔皱着眉头，来回问着他们两个，可是他们都摇摇头。正当他要走开的时候，埃米丽喊道：","Dickensen could not understand his speech, and Emily Travis laughed.Imber turned from one to the other, frowning, but both shook their heads.He was about to go away, when she called out:"
"“喂，吉米！到这里来！”","“Oh, Jimmy!Come here!”"
"吉米从街对面走了过来。他是个身材高大粗陋的印第安人，身上是标准的白人服饰，头上戴着一顶埃尔多拉多国王式的宽边帽。他跟英勃尔谈话的时候，结结巴巴，好像咽喉痉挛了一样。吉米是锡特坎人，对于内地的方言，他只不过略知一二。","Jimmy came from the other side of the street.He was a big, hulking Indian clad in approved white-man style, with an Eldorado king’s sombrero on his head.He talked with Imber, haltingly, with throaty spasms.Jimmy was a Sitkan, possessed of no more than a passing knowledge of the interior dialects."
"“他是怀特菲什人，”他对埃米丽·特拉维斯说，“我不大明白他的话。他想见白人的首领。”","“Him Whitefish man,” he said to Emily Travis.“Me savve um talk no very much.Him want to look see chief white man.”"
"“总督。”迪肯森点明道。","“The Governor,” suggested Dickensen."
"吉米跟这个怀特菲什人又谈了几句，他的脸色变得严肃而且疑惑。","Jimmy talked some more with the Whitefish man, and his face went grave and puzzled."
"“我觉得他是想见亚历山大队长，”他解释道，“他说他杀过白种男人，白种女人，白种小孩，他杀了很多白人。他想死。”","“I t’ink um want Cap’n Alexander,” he explained.“Him say um kill white man, white woman, white boy, plenty kill um white people.Him want to die.”"
"“我猜他是个疯子。”迪肯森说。","“Insane, I guess,” said Dickensen."
"“你说他是什么？”吉米问道。","“What you call dat?” queried Jimmy."
"迪肯森用一根手指指向自己的脑袋，画了一个圈，当作解释。","Dickensen thrust a finger figuratively inside his head and imparted a rotary motion thereto."
"“可能，可能。”吉米说着，回过头去又和英勃尔讲了几句，他仍然要见白人的首领。　","“Mebbe so, mebbe so,” said Jimmy, returning to Imber, who still demanded the chief man of the white men."
"一个骑警（在克朗代克工作时已经不骑马了）来到这伙人中间，听到了英勃尔的再三要求。他是个结实的年轻人，宽肩膀，厚胸脯，匀称的双腿站立时叉得很开，英勃尔虽然个子高，但他比英勃尔还高半个头。他的双眼是灰色的，既冷静又沉着，而且他带着一副由于血统和习惯而产生的对于自己的权力特别信任的神气。过分的孩子气更加衬托出他雄壮的男子汉气概——他不过是个孩子——他那光滑的脸蛋，很容易发红，像个大姑娘。","A mounted policeman (unmounted for Klondike service) joined the group and heard Imber’s wish repeated.He was a stalwart young fellow, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, legs cleanly built and stretched wide apart, and tall though Imber was, he towered above him by half a head.His eyes were cool, and gray, and steady, and he carried himself with the peculiar confidence of power that is bred of blood and tradition.His splendid masculinity was emphasized by his excessive boyishness,—he was a mere lad,—and his smooth cheek promised a blush as willingly as the cheek of a maid."
"英勃尔立刻被他吸引了。他一瞧见这个小伙子脸上的刀疤，眼睛里就闪闪发光。他先用一只干枯的手顺着小伙子的大腿轻抚他鼓起的肌肉。他又用指节敲敲他宽阔的胸膛，并且在肌肉厚得像铠甲一样的肩膀上，按了又按，戳了又戳。许多好奇的路人也围拢过来——有健壮的矿工，也有山区和边区的人，他们都是那种长腿宽肩的人的子孙。英勃尔朝他们一个接一个地瞧过去，然后用怀特菲什的方言大声说起话来。","Imber was drawn to him at once.The fire leaped into his eyes at sight of a sabre slash that scarred his cheek.He ran a withered hand down the young fellow’s leg and caressed the swelling thew.He smote the broad chest with his knuckles, and pressed and prodded the thick muscle-pads that covered the shoulders like a cuirass.The group had been added to by curious passers-by—husky miners, mountaineers, and frontiersmen, sons of the long-legged and broad-shouldered generations.Imber glanced from one to another, then he spoke aloud in the Whitefish tongue."
"“他说什么？”迪肯森问道。","“What did he say?” asked Dickensen."
"“他说他们全跟这个警察一个样。”吉米解释道。","“Him say um all the same one man, dat p’liceman,” Jimmy interpreted."
"小迪肯森个子很小，特拉维斯小姐也一样，他很懊悔问那句话。那个警察因为怕他难堪，就走过来解围。“我想他说的事情也许有点道理。我要把他带到队长那里审问审问。吉米，告诉他，让他跟我走。”","Little Dickensen was little, and what of Miss Travis, he felt sorry for having asked the question.The policeman was sorry for him and stepped into the breach.“I fancy there may be something in his story.I’ll take him up to the captain for examination.Tell him to come along with me, Jimmy.”"
"吉米又结结巴巴地说完，英勃尔咕哝了几声，看样子好像很满意。","Jimmy indulged in more throaty spasms, and Imber grunted and looked satisfied."
"“吉米，再问问他，之前他抓住我的胳膊时说了些什么话，他想干什么。”","“But ask him what he said, Jimmy, and what he meant when he took hold of my arm.”"
"埃米丽·特拉维斯说完，吉米就把这个问题翻译过去并且得到了答复。","So spoke Emily Travis, and Jimmy put the question and received the answer."
"“他说，你不用害怕。”吉米说道。","“Him say you no afraid,” said Jimmy."
"埃米丽·特拉维斯看起来很得意。","Emily Travis looked pleased."
"“他还说你不中用，也不结实，嫩得完全像个小孩子。他用两只手就能把你撕碎，变成一块一块的。他觉得这种事很滑稽，很奇怪，你怎么能生出跟那个警察一样高大、一样健壮的男人。”","“Him say you no skookum, no strong, all the same very soft like little baby.Him break you, in um two hands, to little pieces.Him t’ink much funny, very strange, how you can be mother of men so big, so strong, like dat p’liceman.”"
"埃米丽·特拉维斯没有垂下眼睛，她保持着镇定，但她却面泛红晕。小迪肯森面色通红，难堪不已。至于那个警察，他也满脸通红。","Emily Travers kept her eyes up and unfaltering, but her cheeks were sprayed with scarlet.Little Dickensen blushed and was quite embarrassed.The policeman’s face blazed with his boy’s blood."
"“你跟我走吧。”警察粗声喝道，用肩膀在人群中挤开了一条路。","“Come along, you,” he said gruffly, setting his shoulder to the crowd and forcing a way."
"于是，英勃尔就这样来到了兵营，在那里他主动地招认了一切，从此以后，他就没有走出过兵营。","Thus it was that Imber found his way to the Barracks, where he made full and voluntary confession, and from the precincts of which he never emerged."
"英勃尔看起来很疲倦。从他脸上可以看出因为毫无希望和上了岁数而产生的疲劳感。　他沮丧地垂着双肩，眼睛里黯然无光。他那蓬乱的头发本来应该是白的，但风吹日晒已经让它们显得十分松弛，毫无生气和光泽。他对周围的所有事情都不感兴趣。审判室里挤满了在河里淘金和在山上打猎的人，他们低沉的声音里夹杂的隆隆声带着一种不祥的调子，在他听起来好像是海水在深穴里低吼。","Imber looked very tired.The fatigue of hopelessness and age was in his face.His shoulders drooped depressingly, and his eyes were lack-lustre.His mop of hair should have been white, but sun and weatherbeat had burned and bitten it so that it hung limp and lifeless and colorless.He took no interest in what went on around him.The courtroom was jammed with the men of the creeks and trails, and there was an ominous note in the rumble and grumble of their low-pitched voices, which came to his ears like the growl of the sea from deep caverns."
"他靠窗边坐着，那双漠然的眼睛不时瞧着窗外凄凉的景色。天上阴云密布，正下着灰蒙蒙的细雨。目前正是育空河涨水的季节。冰已经融化了，河水漫进了城区。人们划着独木舟或用篙撑着船，在大街上不停地来来往往。他常常看到那些船从街上转弯，划到被水淹没的四四方方的一块地方，那是兵营的阅兵场。有时那些船划到他下面就不见了，他听到船轧轧地撞着房子的木头，船上的人就从窗外爬进来。随后便听到他们用腿搅着泥水，穿过楼下的房间，爬上楼梯。接着他们就出现在房门口，拎着脱下的帽子，穿着湿淋淋的航海靴子，加入到等待的人群里面。","He sat close by a window, and his apathetic eyes rested now and again on the dreary scene without.The sky was overcast, and a gray drizzle was falling.It was flood-time on the Yukon.The ice was gone, and the river was up in the town.Back and forth on the main street, in canoes and poling-boats, passed the people that never rested.Often he saw these boats turn aside from the street and enter the flooded square that marked the Barracks’ parade-ground.Sometimes they disappeared beneath him, and he heard them jar against the house-logs and their occupants scramble in through the window.After that came the slush of water against men’s legs as they waded across the lower room and mounted the stairs.Then they appeared in the doorway, with doffed hats and dripping sea-boots, and added themselves to the waiting crowd."
"当这些人的眼光集中在他身上，残酷地等待他被判刑而获得满足感的时候，英勃尔也瞧着他们，默默地想着他们的生活方式，他们的从不睡觉，永不停息的法律，不论好年头，坏年头，闹水灾还是闹饥荒，或者在人们遭受烦恼、恐惧同死亡的时候，它都永无休止，直到时间的尽头。一个人使劲地拍着桌子，于是谈话的声音就弱了下来，直至寂静无声。英勃尔瞧了瞧这个人。他好像是个很有权的人，但是英勃尔却认为那个坐在后面一张桌子旁边的方脑门的人才是他们的首领，他不仅在他们所有人之上，也在这个拍桌子的人之上。跟他同桌的另外一个人站起来，拿着许多张精美的纸，开始高声读起来。他读每一页开头的时候，总要清下嗓子，而读每一页末尾的时候，总要舔下手指。英勃尔不明白他的话，但其他人都懂，他看得出这些话使他们很生气。有时候还使他们恼羞成怒，有一次一个人还用简短的话骂他，很刺耳很激烈，直到桌子旁边有个人拍桌子，才使他安静下来。","And while they centred their looks on him, and in grim anticipation enjoyed the penalty he was to pay, Imber looked at them, and mused on their ways, and on their Law that never slept, but went on unceasing, in good times and bad, in flood and famine, through trouble and terror and death, and which would go on unceasing, it seemed to him, to the end of time.A man rapped sharply on a table, and the conversation droned away into silence.Imber looked at the man.He seemed one in authority, yet Imber divined the square-browed man who sat by a desk farther back to be the one chief over them all and over the man who had rapped.Another man by the same table uprose and began to read aloud from many fine sheets of paper.At the top of each sheet he cleared his throat, at the bottom moistened his fingers.Imber did not understand his speech, but the others did, and he knew that it made them angry.Sometimes it made them very angry, and once a man cursed him, in single syllables, stinging and tense, till a man at the table rapped him to silence."
"那个人念了好久。他那单调拖长的声音使得英勃尔打起瞌睡来，等他念完，英勃尔已经睡得很沉了。这时一个人用他家乡怀特菲什的方言跟他说话，他醒过来，看见他姐姐的儿子的面孔并未感到惊讶，因为这个小伙子多年前就出去流浪，跟白人住在一起了。","For an interminable period the man read.His monotonous, sing-song utterance lured Imber to dreaming, and he was dreaming deeply when the man ceased.A voice spoke to him in his own Whitefish tongue, and he roused up, without surprise, to look upon the face of his sister’s son, a young man who had wandered away years agone to make his dwelling with the whites."
"“你不记得我了。”那个人说着，算是跟他打招呼。","“Thou dost not remember me,” he said by way of greeting."
"“记得，”英勃尔回答道，“你就是走到外地去的霍坎。你妈去世啦。”","“Nay,” Imber answered.“Thou art Howkan who went away.Thy mother be dead.”"
"“她上岁数了。”霍坎说。","“She was an old woman,” said Howkan."
"可是英勃尔没有听到。霍坎将手搭在他的肩膀上，再次把他弄醒。","But Imber did not hear, and Howkan, with hand upon his shoulder, roused him again."
"“我要把刚才那个人念过的话跟你讲一下，他说的都是你惹出的乱子，也就是你，你这个傻瓜，对亚历山大队长讲的。你要明白，你得老实交待这些话究竟是真是假。这是法庭的命令。”","“I shall speak to thee what the man has spoken, which is the tale of the troubles thou hast done and which thou hast told, O fool, to the Captain Alexander.And thou shalt understand and say if it be true talk or talk not true.It is so commanded.”"
"霍坎曾经跟教会里的人混过一阵，他们教会了他读书写字。他手里拿着先前那个人大声宣读过的许多讲究的纸张，纸上记的是英勃尔第一次通过吉米向亚历山大队长坦白的口供，一个书记员已将其记录下来。霍坎开始读起来。英勃尔听了一会儿，脸上露出诧异的神情，便突然插嘴道：","Howkan had fallen among the mission folk and been taught by them to read and write.In his hands he held the many fine sheets from which the man had read aloud, and which had been taken down by a clerk when Imber first made confession, through the mouth of Jimmy, to Captain Alexander.Howkan began to read.Imber listened for a space, when a wonderment rose up in his face and he broke in abruptly."
"“这是我说过的话，霍坎。你的耳朵并没有听到，可是嘴里怎么会说得出来。”","“That be my talk, Howkan.Yet from thy lips it comes when thy ears have not heard.”"
"霍坎洋洋自得地笑了笑。他的头发是从中间分开的。“不，英勃尔，这些话都是纸上来的。我的耳朵根本没有听见过。它们写在纸上，通过我的眼睛，进入我的大脑，再由我的嘴读出来给你听。这些话就是这么来的。”","Howkan smirked with self-appreciation.His hair was parted in the middle.“Nay, from the paper it comes, O Imber.Never have my ears heard.From the paper it comes, through my eyes, into my head, and out of my mouth to thee.Thus it comes.”"
"“就是这么来的？　这些话都在纸上？”英勃尔的声音低沉，充满敬畏，用拇指和食指沙沙地拨弄那些纸，盯着涂在上面的文字。“这真是一种了不起的法术，霍坎，你简直是创造奇迹的法师。”","“Thus it comes?It be there in the paper?”Imber’s voice sank in whisperful awe as he crackled the sheets ’twixt thumb and finger and stared at the charactery scrawled thereon.“It be a great medicine, Howkan, and thou art a worker of wonders.”"
"“算不了什么，算不了什么。”这个小伙子满不在乎地说，非常得意。他拿起文件随便挑了一页读着：“那一年，在解冻之前，来了一个老头和一个跛脚的男孩。他们也是我杀的，那个老头叫唤得很厉害——”","“It be nothing, it be nothing,” the young man responded carelessly and pridefully.He read at hazard from the document: “In that year, before the break of the ice, came an old man, and a boy who was lame of one foot.These also did I kill, and the old man made much noise—”"
"“这是真的，”英勃尔上气不接下气地插嘴道，“他叫唤得很厉害，过了好久都不肯死。可是你怎么知道的，霍坎？大概是白人首领告诉你的吧？当时没人看见我，我只告诉过他一个人。”霍坎不耐烦地摇了摇头。“我不是跟你说过这些话写在纸上了吗？你这个傻瓜。”","“It be true,” Imber interrupted breathlessly.“He made much noise and would not die for a long time.But how dost thou know, Howkan?The chief man of the white men told thee, mayhap?No one beheld me, and him alone have I told.”Howkan shook his head with impatience.“Have I not told thee it be there in the paper, O fool?”"
"英勃尔使劲盯着纸上的笔迹。“就像猎人瞅着雪地说，昨天有一只兔子从这里跑过；它在这片柳树丛旁停下听着，后来听到了什么，感到害怕，转身就往回跑；这里，它飞快地奔跑，用力地跳跃；可是这里来了一直山猫，跑得更快，跳得更远；这里，雪地里留下几个很深的猫爪子印，一定是那只山猫猛地一跳；这里，它扑倒了那只兔子，把它肚皮朝天翻了过来；这里，只留下山猫的脚印，再看不到兔子的了，——猎人看见雪上留下的印记，就会这么说，那么，你是不是也一样，看着那张纸，就会这么说，说老英勃尔干了些什么事？”","Imber stared hard at the ink-scrawled surface.“As the hunter looks upon the snow and says, Here but yesterday there passed a rabbit; and here by the willow scrub it stood and listened, and heard, and was afraid; and here it turned upon its trail; and here it went with great swiftness, leaping wide; and here, with greater swiftness and wider leapings, came a lynx; and here, where the claws cut deep into the snow, the lynx made a very great leap; and here it struck, with the rabbit under and rolling belly up; and here leads off the trail of the lynx alone, and there is no more rabbit,—as the hunter looks upon the markings of the snow and says thus and so and here, dost thou, too, look upon the paper and say thus and so and here be the things old Imber hath done?”"
"“一点儿也不错，”霍坎说，“现在你好好听着，管住你那根舌头，别像女人一样唠叨，叫你说话，你才可以说。”","“Even so,” said Howkan.“And now do thou listen, and keep thy woman’s tongue between thy teeth till thou art called upon for speech.”"
"之后好长时间，霍坎都在对他宣读他的口供，英勃尔一直沉思不语。最后，他说：","Thereafter, and for a long time, Howkan read to him the confession, and Imber remained musing and silent.At the end, he said:"
"“这些是我说过的话，都是真的，但是我老了，霍坎，一些忘了的事情现在才想起来，这些也应该让那个首领知道。首先，有一个从冰山那面过来的人，带着灵巧的铁夹子，想在怀特菲什河里捉海狸。他被我杀了。很久以前还有三个到怀特菲什河淘金的人。我也把他们杀了，丢在那里喂狼了。还有在五指山，有一个人划着木筏，带了许多肉。”","“It be my talk, and true talk, but I am grown old, Howkan, and forgotten things come back to me which were well for the head man there to know.First, there was the man who came over the Ice Mountains, with cunning traps made of iron, who sought the beaver of the Whitefish.Him I slew.And there were three men seeking gold on the Whitefish long ago.Them also I slew, and left them to the wolverines.And at the Five Fingers there was a man with a raft and much meat.”"
"每逢英勃尔停下来回忆的时候，霍坎就翻译，一个书记员连忙记录。审判室里的人麻木地听着每一个不加渲染的小悲剧，直到英勃尔讲到一个红发斜眼的男人被他远远地一枪打死。","At the moments when Imber paused to remember, Howkan translated and a clerk reduced to writing.The courtroom listened stolidly to each unadorned little tragedy, till Imber told of a red-haired man whose eyes were crossed and whom he had killed with a remarkably long shot."
"“他妈的。”坐在旁听席前排的一个人说。他说得很激动，很悲伤。他是红头发。“他妈的，”他又说了一遍，“那是我哥哥比尔。”在整个审判过程中，每隔一段时间，审判室里就能听到他那声沉痛的“他妈的”；他的同伴没有阻拦他，坐在桌旁的那个人也不拍桌子制止他。","“Hell,” said a man in the forefront of the onlookers.He said it soulfully and sorrowfully.He was red-haired.“Hell,” he repeated.“That was my brother Bill.”And at regular intervals throughout the session, his solemn “Hell” was heard in the courtroom; nor did his comrades check him, nor did the man at the table rap him to order."
"英勃尔的头又垂下去，他的双眼变得模糊，好像生了一层薄膜，看不见周围的世界。于是他做起梦来，梦见了只有上了岁数的人才会想起的无限虚度的青春岁月。","Imber’s head drooped once more, and his eyes went dull, as though a film rose up and covered them from the world.And he dreamed as only age can dream upon the colossal futility of youth."
"后来，霍坎又一次叫醒了他，说道：“站起来，英勃尔。法庭命令你讲出为什么惹这些乱子，杀死这些人，最后又跑来这里自首。”","Later, Howkan roused him again, saying: “Stand up, O Imber.It be commanded that thou tellest why you did these troubles, and slew these people, and at the end journeyed here seeking the Law.”"
"英勃尔无力地站起来，前后摇晃着。他开始说了，声音很低，微微发出隆隆声，但是霍坎打断了他。","Imber rose feebly to his feet and swayed back and forth.He began to speak in a low and faintly rumbling voice, but Howkan interrupted him."
"“这个老头子，他真是疯了，”他用英文对那个方脑门的人说，“他说的都是蠢话，跟小孩子一样。”","“This old man, he is damn crazy,” he said in English to the square-browed man.“His talk is foolish and like that of a child.”"
"“我们就听听他那跟小孩子一样的话吧，”方脑门的人说，“我们要逐字逐字地听他讲下去。你明白吗？”","“We will hear his talk which is like that of a child,” said the square-browed man.“And we will hear it, word for word, as he speaks it.Do you understand?”"
"霍坎领会了，英勃尔的眼睛里闪着光，因为他亲眼目睹了他的外甥和那个掌权的人之间的较量。然后他讲起了自己的故事，这是一首讲述青铜肤色的爱国者的史诗，值得刻在青铜碑上留给后世。大家都安静得出奇，那个方脑门的法官用手支着脑袋，思量着这个人的灵魂和他民族的灵魂。只听见英勃尔深沉的音调，和那个翻译的尖嗓门，有节奏地交替着，不时还听见那个红头发男人冥思苦想似地说声“他妈的”，好像上帝的钟声。","Howkan understood, and Imber’s eyes flashed, for he had witnessed the play between his sister’s son and the man in authority.And then began the story, the epic of a bronze patriot which might well itself be wrought into bronze for the generations unborn.The crowd fell strangely silent, and the square-browed judge leaned head on hand and pondered his soul and the soul of his race.Only was heard the deep tones of Imber, rhythmically alternating with the shrill voice of the interpreter, and now and again, like the bell of the Lord, the wondering and meditative “Hell” of the red-haired man."
"“我是英勃尔，怀特菲什人。”霍坎这样翻译着，他一听到英勃尔野蛮的语气和音调，他天生的野性就控制住了他，使他忘记了教会的教养和文明的外表。“我的父亲是奥兹巴奥克，一条壮实的汉子。”我小的时候，我们那块土地上都是暖洋洋的阳光和快乐的人们。没有人追求奇怪的东西，也没有人听陌生人的话。他们的父辈怎么生活，他们就怎么生活。女人都得到年轻男人的喜爱，男人们心满意足地瞧着她们。女人给孩子们喂奶，她们让部族的人口增加，自己的屁股就大起来了。那个时候，男人都是汉子。不管在太平富饶的日子里还是遇到战争饥荒，他们都是汉子。","“I am Imber of the Whitefish people.”So ran the interpretation of Howkan, whose inherent barbarism gripped hold of him, and who lost his mission culture and veneered civilization as he caught the savage ring and rhythm of old Imber’s tale.“My father was Otsbaok, a strong man.The land was warm with sunshine and gladness when I was a boy.The people did not hunger after strange things, nor hearken to new voices, and the ways of their fathers were their ways.The women found favor in the eyes of the young men, and the young men looked upon them with content.Babes hung at the breasts of the women, and they were heavy-hipped with increase of the tribe.Men were men in those days.In peace and plenty, and in war and famine, they were men."
"“那个时候，河里的鱼比现在多，林子里的肉也比现在多。我们的狗都像狼，厚厚的皮毛，暖暖和和，不怕冰霜，也不怕风雪。我们的狗这样，我们也是这样，我们同样不怕冰霜，不怕风雪。佩利人来到我们地面上的时候，我们就杀了他们，也被他们杀了不少。因为我们怀特菲什的人，我们都是汉子，我们的父辈和祖辈跟佩利人打过，还划定了疆界。","“At that time there was more fish in the water than now, and more meat in the forest.Our dogs were wolves, warm with thick hides and hard to the frost and storm.And as with our dogs so with us, for we were likewise hard to the frost and storm.And when the Pellys came into our land we slew them and were slain.For we were men, we Whitefish, and our fathers and our fathers’ fathers had fought against the Pellys and determined the bounds of the land."
"“就像我说的，我们的狗这样，我们也是这样。有一天，第一个白人来了。他在雪地里，用手和膝盖爬过来。他的皮绷得紧紧的，下面是凸起的骨头。我们想，从来没有过这样的人，我们很奇怪，他来自哪个陌生的部族，哪个地方呢。他很虚弱，非常虚弱，像小孩一样，因此，我们就在火边给他腾了个位子，让他躺在温暖的毛皮上，像给小孩喂东西一样喂他。","“As I say, with our dogs, so with us.And one day came the first white man.He dragged himself, so, on hand and knee, in the snow.And his skin was stretched tight, and his bones were sharp beneath.Never was such a man, we thought, and we wondered of what strange tribe he was, and of its land.And he was weak, most weak, like a little child, so that we gave him a place by the fire, and warm furs to lie upon, and we gave him food as little children are given food."
"“他带着一条狗，有我们的三条狗那么大，也是很虚弱。那条狗的毛很短，不能保暖，尾巴都冻僵了，尾巴尖都给冻掉了。我们给这只陌生的狗喂吃的，让它在火边卧着，并且把我们的狗赶开，要不然它就给咬死了。吃了驼鹿肉和晒干的鲑鱼之后，那个人和他的狗就有了力气，有了力气，他们就变得大模大样，无所畏惧了。那个人说话大声，不管老的还是年轻的，都要取笑，还大胆地瞟那些小姑娘。他的那只狗和我们的狗打架，别瞧它的毛又短又软，它一天里就咬死了我们三条狗。","“And with him was a dog, large as three of our dogs, and very weak.The hair of this dog was short, and not warm, and the tail was frozen so that the end fell off.And this strange dog we fed, and bedded by the fire, and fought from it our dogs, which else would have killed him.And what of the moose meat and the sun-dried salmon, the man and dog took strength to themselves; and what of the strength they became big and unafraid.And the man spoke loud words and laughed at the old men and young men, and looked boldly upon the maidens.And the dog fought with our dogs, and for all of his short hair and softness slew three of them in one day."
"“我们问起他那一族的人时，他说，‘我有不少弟兄，’然后便不怀好意地笑了。他完全恢复体力以后就离开了，瑙达，我们首领的女儿，也跟着走了。之后发生的第一桩事就是，我们的一只母狗生了小狗。从没见过这样品种的狗——脑袋大，嘴唇厚，毛又短，不中用。我记得很清楚，我的父亲，奥兹巴奥克，一条壮实的汉子。他一看见这个不中用的东西，就气得脸色铁青，他拿起一块石头，就那样，那个不中用的东西就没了。那之后，过了两个夏天，瑙达怀里抱着个男孩回来了。","“When we asked the man concerning his people, he said, ‘I have many brothers,’ and laughed in a way that was not good.And when he was in his full strength he went away, and with him went Noda, daughter to the chief.First, after that, was one of our bitches brought to pup.And never was there such a breed of dogs,—big-headed, thick-jawed, and short-haired, and helpless.Well do I remember my father, Otsbaok, a strong man.His face was black with anger at such helplessness, and he took a stone, so, and so, and there was no more helplessness.And two summers after that came Noda back to us with a man-child in the hollow of her arm."
"“这才是开始。第二个白人又来了，他带了几条短毛狗，走的时候丢下了它们。但是他带走了我们六条最壮实的狗，作为交易，他给了我舅舅库苏提一把很棒的能快速连放六响的手枪。　库苏提觉得有了这把枪就很了不起，他还嘲笑我们的弓箭。他说那是‘女人的东西’，然后就拿着手枪去打那只脸上没毛的灰熊。如今我们都知道了，用手枪去打灰熊是不行的，可是那时候我们怎么能知道呢？库苏提又怎么能知道呢？于是他很英勇地去了，用手枪飞快地连放了六响，但是那只灰熊只哼了一声，就像抓鸡蛋一样把他的胸口抓得粉碎，库苏提的脑浆像蜂蜜流出蜂窝一样流了一地。他是个能干的猎手，但是再也没有人给他老婆孩子把肉带回家了。我们都很痛苦，我们说，‘白人的好东西，就是我们的坏东西。’这是真的。白人很多，还都是胖胖的，但是依着他们过日子的办法却让我们的人少了，瘦了。","“And that was the beginning.Came a second white man, with short-haired dogs, which he left behind him when he went.And with him went six of our strongest dogs, for which, in trade, he had given Koo-So-Tee, my mother’s brother, a wonderful pistol that fired with great swiftness six times.And Koo-So-Tee was very big, what of the pistol, and laughed at our bows and arrows.‘Woman’s things,’ he called them, and went forth against the bald-face grizzly, with the pistol in his hand.Now it be known that it is not good to hunt the bald-face with a pistol, but how were we to know? and how was Koo-So-Tee to know?So he went against the bald-face, very brave, and fired the pistol with great swiftness six times; and the bald-face but grunted and broke in his breast like it were an egg, and like honey from a bee’s nest dripped the brains of Koo-So-Tee upon the ground.He was a good hunter, and there was no one to bring meat to his squaw and children.And we were bitter, and we said, ‘That which for the white men is well, is for us not well.’ And this be true.There be many white men and fat, but their ways have made us few and lean."
"“第三个白人来了，带来了各种各样奇特的能吃的和能用的东西。作为交换，他带走了我们二十条最壮实的狗。另外，他还用礼物和承诺带走了我们十个年轻的猎手，把他们弄到了没人知道的地方。据说，他们不是死在没有人烟的冰山积雪里，就是死在天边寂静的大山里了。不管怎么样，从那以后，怀特菲什的人再也没有见过那些狗和那些年轻的猎手了。","“Came the third white man, with great wealth of all manner of wonderful foods and things.And twenty of our strongest dogs he took from us in trade.Also, what of presents and great promises, ten of our young hunters did he take with him on a journey which fared no man knew where.It is said they died in the snow of the Ice Mountains where man has never been, or in the Hills of Silence which are beyond the edge of the earth.Be that as it may, dogs and young hunters were seen never again by the Whitefish people."
"“从此以后，一年又一年，白人来得更多了，他们总是用钱和礼物把那些年轻人带走。有时候，有的年轻人会回来，给我们讲在比佩利人居住地更远的地方，他们经历的危险和艰难，有时候，他们根本不回来。我们说：‘要说那些白人不怕送命，是因为他们人多；但是我们怀特菲什人少，年轻人不能再离开了。’但是年轻人还是离开了，连年轻的女人也离开了，我们很恼火。","“And more white men came with the years, and ever, with pay and presents, they led the young men away with them.And sometimes the young men came back with strange tales of dangers and toils in the lands beyond the Pellys, and sometimes they did not come back.And we said: ‘If they be unafraid of life, these white men, it is because they have many lives; but we be few by the Whitefish, and the young men shall go away no more.’But the young men did go away; and the young women went also; and we were very wroth."
"“确实，我们吃到了面粉、腌猪肉，喝上了茶，很高兴；可是我们弄不到茶的时候就很糟了，我们变得少言寡语，还容易生气。这样我们慢慢盼望白人能带来那些东西跟我们交易。交易！交易！始终都是交易！有一年冬天，我们卖出去的肉，换来了不会走的钟，坏了零件的手表，磨平了的锉刀，还有没有子弹的手枪，都是没用的东西。然后就闹起了饥荒，我们没了肉，开春之前，有四十个人饿死了。","“It be true, we ate flour, and salt pork, and drank tea which was a great delight; only, when we could not get tea, it was very bad and we became short of speech and quick of anger.So we grew to hunger for the things the white men brought in trade.Trade! trade! all the time was it trade!One winter we sold our meat for clocks that would not go, and watches with broken guts, and files worn smooth, and pistols without cartridges and worthless.And then came famine, and we were without meat, and two score died ere the break of spring."
"“我们说，‘如今我们弱了，佩利人会来打我们，攻占我们的地盘的。’不过我们经历的，佩利人也经历了，他们也变弱了，没法来打我们了。","“‘Now are we grown weak,’ we said; ‘and the Pellys will fall upon us, and our bounds be overthrown.’ But as it fared with us, so had it fared with the Pellys, and they were too weak to come against us."
"“我的父亲，奥兹巴奥克，一条壮实的汉子，这时已经老了，但是非常有见识。他跟首领说：‘瞧，我们的狗都用不上了。它们的皮毛不厚了，身体也不结实了，它们会在冰雪中干活的时候死掉。我们不如去村子里把它们杀了，只把狼种留下，然后夜里把它们栓在外面，让它们跟林子里的野狼交配。这样一来，我们就又能得到那些皮毛暖和身体结实的狗了。","“My father, Otsbaok, a strong man, was now old and very wise.And he spoke to the chief, saying: ‘Behold, our dogs be worthless.No longer are they thick-furred and strong, and they die in the frost and harness.Let us go into the village and kill them, saving only the wolf ones, and these let us tie out in the night that they may mate with the wild wolves of the forest.Thus shall we have dogs warm and strong again.’"
"“首领听了他的话，我们怀特菲什人就因为我们的狗而出名了，它们是这一带最棒的狗。可是我们不是因为自己才出名的。我们最棒的年轻男女都跟着白人从水路陆路走了，到很远的地方去了。年轻女人，回来的时候都老了，都衰弱了，就像瑙达回来时一样，要不她们就不回来。年轻男人会回来一段时间，他们在火堆旁坐着，说话下流，举止粗野，喝着害人的酒，整日整夜地赌博，他们老是心神不宁，直到白人来叫他们，他们就又走了，跑到我们不知道的地方去了。他们没有尊严，也不尊敬别人，嘲笑往日的风俗，还当面讥笑首领和萨满巫师们。","“And his word was harkened to, and we Whitefish became known for our dogs, which were the best in the land.But known we were not for ourselves.The best of our young men and women had gone away with the white men to wander on trail and river to far places.And the young women came back old and broken, as Noda had come, or they came not at all.And the young men came back to sit by our fires for a time, full of ill speech and rough ways, drinking evil drinks and gambling through long nights and days, with a great unrest always in their hearts, till the call of the white men came to them and they went away again to the unknown places.And they were without honor and respect, jeering the old-time customs and laughing in the faces of chief and shamans."
"“就像我说的，我们怀特菲什人变成了一个弱小的民族了。我们卖掉我们暖和的皮毛，换来了烟草、威士忌和单薄的棉布衣服，让我们在严寒中冻得发抖。咳嗽病也找上了我们，男男女女整夜咳嗽，出汗，出去打猎的人在雪地上吐血。还时不时地有一个又一个人嘴里突然喷血，接着就死了。女人们生的孩子也少了，生出来的也都体弱多病。还有很多其他的病也是白人带给我们的，都是我们从没见过也不懂怎么回事的病。像天花、麻疹，我听别人是这么说的；我们的人就是害了这样的病死了，就好像鲑鱼在秋天产完卵，不需要再活下去了，就死在静止的水涡里了。","“As I say, we were become a weak breed, we Whitefish.We sold our warm skins and furs for tobacco and whiskey and thin cotton things that left us shivering in the cold.And the coughing sickness came upon us, and men and women coughed and sweated through the long nights, and the hunters on trail spat blood upon the snow.And now one, and now another, bled swiftly from the mouth and died.And the women bore few children, and those they bore were weak and given to sickness.And other sicknesses came to us from the white men, the like of which we had never known and could not understand.Smallpox, likewise measles, have I heard these sicknesses named, and we died of them as die the salmon in the still eddies when in the fall their eggs are spawned and there is no longer need for them to live."
"“然而，奇怪的是，白人像死亡的气息一样飘来，他们的那一套总是把人带往死路，他们的鼻孔里都是死亡的气息，但是他们死不了。他们的威士忌、烟草还有短毛狗；他们那么多的病，天花、麻疹、咳嗽、吐血；他们的白皮肤，经不住冰霜和风雪；他们不中用的手枪，即使能飞快地连放六响。尽管有那么多病，他们还越长越胖，越来越兴旺，掌控着全世界，霸道地践踏着全世界的人们。他们的女人也娇嫩得跟婴儿一样，外表很柔弱，但是不容易完蛋，那些男人都是他们生的。而且，从这种种柔嫩、疾病和虚弱之中，产生的是力量、权势和权威。他们是神是鬼，就要看情况了。我可不知道。我，怀特菲什的老英勃尔，又能知道什么？我只知道他们让人没法了解，这些白人，总是流浪到很远的地方，在他们走过的地方打仗。","“And yet, and here be the strangeness of it, the white men come as the breath of death; all their ways lead to death, their nostrils are filled with it; and yet they do not die.Theirs the whiskey, and tobacco, and short-haired dogs; theirs the many sicknesses, the smallpox and measles, the coughing and mouth-bleeding; theirs the white skin, and softness to the frost and storm; and theirs the pistols that shoot six times very swift and are worthless.And yet they grow fat on their many ills, and prosper, and lay a heavy hand over all the world and tread mightily upon its peoples.And their women, too, are soft as little babes, most breakable and never broken, the mothers of men.And out of all this softness, and sickness, and weakness, come strength, and power, and authority.They be gods, or devils, as the case may be.I do not know.What do I know, I, old Imber of the Whitefish?Only do I know that they are past understanding, these white men, far-wanderers and fighters over the earth that they be."
"“就像我说的，林子里的肉越来越少。这是真的，白人的枪好极了，在老远的地方就打中；但是没有野兽可打的时候，要枪还有什么用？我小的时候，在怀特菲什，每座山上都有驼鹿，每年都有无数的驯鹿跑来。但是如今，猎手跑上十天也见不到一只驼鹿，至于那无数的驯鹿，根本就不来了。要我说，没有野兽可打的时候，枪一点用都没有，即使能隔着老远就打中。","“As I say, the meat in the forest became less and less.It be true, the white man’s gun is most excellent and kills a long way off; but of what worth the gun, when there is no meat to kill?When I was a boy on the Whitefish there was moose on every hill, and each year came the caribou uncountable.But now the hunter may take the trail ten days and not one moose gladden his eyes, while the caribou uncountable come no more at all.Small worth the gun, I say, killing a long way off, when there be nothing to kill."
"“而我，英勃尔，看着怀特菲什人、佩利人，还有这块地面上所有的部族，都像林子里的野兽一样渐渐消亡，我思量着这些事情。思量了很久。我跟萨满巫师们和那些见多识广的老人们商量。为了避免村子里的嘈杂打扰，我就离开村子，我不吃肉，以免我的肚子发胀、我的眼睛和耳朵都变得迟钝。我昼夜不眠地在林子里坐了很长时间，我睁大眼睛等待征兆，我耐心和敏锐的耳朵等待着要传给我的话。我一个人在黑夜里徘徊，走到河边，风在悲啼，水在啜泣，我打算在那里找到逝去的萨满巫师们的灵魂给我的启示。","“And I, Imber, pondered upon these things, watching the while the Whitefish, and the Pellys, and all the tribes of the land, perishing as perished the meat of the forest.Long I pondered.I talked with the shamans and the old men who were wise.I went apart that the sounds of the village might not disturb me, and I ate no meat so that my belly should not press upon me and make me slow of eye and ear.I sat long and sleepless in the forest, wide-eyed for the sign, my ears patient and keen for the word that was to come.And I wandered alone in the blackness of night to the river bank, where was wind-moaning and sobbing of water, and where I sought wisdom from the ghosts of old shamans in the trees and dead and gone."
"“最后，像幻影一样，在我的面前出现了那些可恶的短毛狗，办法似乎很简单。当初，我的父亲奥兹巴奥克，一条壮实的汉子，正是因为有了他的智慧，我们的狼狗才保留了纯种的血统，它们才保有暖和的毛皮和足够的力气去拉雪橇。于是，我回到村子里，跟人们讲述。‘这些白人，他们是一个部族，’我说，‘一个很大的部族，可以肯定的是，他们的土地上没有肉了，然后他们就来到我们中间，想在这里给自己开拓一片新天地。但是他们让我们变弱了，我们的人死了。他们是贪婪的民族。我们已经没有兽肉了，要是我们想活下去，就得像对付他们的狗一样对付他们。’","“And in the end, as in a vision, came to me the short-haired and detestable dogs, and the way seemed plain.By the wisdom of Otsbaok, my father and a strong man, had the blood of our own wolf-dogs been kept clean, wherefore had they remained warm of hide and strong in the harness.So I returned to my village and made oration to the men.‘This be a tribe, these white men,’ I said.‘A very large tribe, and doubtless there is no longer meat in their land, and they are come among us to make a new land for themselves.But they weaken us, and we die.They are a very hungry folk.Already has our meat gone from us, and it were well, if we would live, that we deal by them as we have dealt by their dogs.’"
"“我还说了很多，劝大家跟敌人作战。怀特菲什河的人听了以后，有的这样说，有的那样说，还有些人说了些废话，没人大胆地谈到行动和作战。虽然年轻人意志薄弱，胆小怕事，但是我观察到，那些老人却默默坐着，眼睛里闪着怒火。之后，在林子里，我们谈了很多。这时，我们已经达成共识，我们记起了年轻时的好日子，自由的土地，丰衣足食的光景，有快乐还有阳光；我们结成兄弟，保证保守秘密，发誓要把侵入我们土地的害人种族清除干净。很明显，我们都是傻子，但是当时我们这些怀特菲什的老头子怎么知道？","“And further oration I made, counselling fight.And the men of the Whitefish listened, and some said one thing, and some another, and some spoke of other and worthless things, and no man made brave talk of deeds and war.But while the young men were weak as water and afraid, watched that the old men sat silent, and that in their eyes fires came and went.And later, when forest and made more talk.And now we were agreed, and we remembered the good young days, and the free land, and the times of plenty, and the gladness and sunshine; and we called ourselves brothers, and swore great secrecy, and a mighty oath to cleanse the land of the evil breed that had come upon it.It be plain we were fools, but how were we to know, we old men of the Whitefish?"
"“为了激励其他人，我第一个行动了。我一直在育空河岸守卫着，直到第一只独木船从上游漂来。上面有两个白人，我站在岸上，举起一只手，他们就改变了路线，朝我这面划来。船头的那个人刚抬起头，打算弄清楚我为什么招呼他，我的箭就嗖的一声穿过空气，直射进他的咽喉，这时他知道了。第二个人本来在船尾划桨，他的来复枪还没举到肩头，我已经扔出三根矛，第一根就击中了他。","“And to hearten the others, I did the first deed.I kept guard upon the Yukon till the first canoe came down.In it were two white men, and when I stood upright upon the bank and raised my hand they changed their course and drove in to me.And as the man in the bow lifted his head, so, that he might know wherefore I wanted him, my arrow sang through the air straight to his throat, and he knew.The second man, who held paddle in the stern, had his rifle half to his shoulder when the first of my three spear-casts smote him."
"“‘这就算开始了，’老头子们都聚集到我身边的时候，我说，‘以后我们就要联合各个部族的老头子，再以后就是那些还很结实的年轻人，这样，干起来就容易了。’","“ ‘These be the first,’ I said, when the old men had gathered to me.‘Later we will bind together all the old men of all the tribes, and after that the young men who remain strong, and the work will become easy.’"
"“然后，我们把那两具白人的尸体扔到了河里。至于那只独木船，真是只好船，我们点了把火，把船连同船上的东西一并烧了。不过烧之前我们看了看那些东西，是一些皮口袋，我们拿刀子把它们割开了。里面有很多写着字的纸，霍坎，就跟你刚才念的那些一样，上面的符号我们看了都很奇怪，搞不明白。如今，我变聪明了，我知道那是人们说的话，就像你跟我说的话一样。”","“And then the two dead white men we cast into the river.And of the canoe, which was a very good canoe, we made a fire, and a fire, also, of the things within the canoe.But first we looked at the things, and they were pouches of leather which we cut open with our knives.And inside these pouches were many papers, like that from which thou has read, O Howkan, with markings on them which we marvelled at and could not understand.Now, I am become wise, and I know them for the speech of men as thou hast told me.”"
"霍坎把独木船的事情翻译完之后，审判室里响起了一片嘁嘁喳喳的低语声，一个男人大声说：“那是九一年丢掉的邮包，彼得·詹姆斯和德莱尼负责押运，马修斯是最后见到他们的人，还在勒巴尔杰湖边跟他们说过话。”书记不停地写下去，于是，北方的历史又添了一段内容。","A whisper and buzz went around the courtroom when Howkan finished interpreting the affair of the canoe, and one man’s voice spoke up: “That was the lost ’91 mail, Peter James and Delaney bringing it in and last spoken at Le Barge by Matthews going out.”The clerk scratched steadily away, and another paragraph was added to the history of the North."
"“要说的也不多了，”英勃尔慢吞吞地说了下去，“我们干过的事情都在纸上了。我们是老头子，我们不明白。我，英勃尔，到现在也不明白。我们暗地里杀，不停地杀，年龄越大，我们就越狡猾，我们学会了出手快，但是不慌张。当白人来到我们当中，铁青着脸，粗鲁地骂人，还拿铁链带走了我们六个无助的年轻人的时候，我们就明白了，我们得到更广的范围、更远的地方去杀。于是，我们这些老头子就一个又一个地到上游和下游不知名的地方去了。这是一种勇敢的行为。我们老了，什么都不怕，但是对于年纪大的人来说，出远门还是件可怕的事。","“There be little more,” Imber went on slowly.“It be there on the paper, the things we did.We were old men, and we did not understand.Even I, Imber, do not now understand.Secretly we slew, and continued to slay, for with our years we were crafty and we had learned the swiftness of going without haste.When white men came among us with black looks and rough words, and took away six of the young men with irons binding them helpless, we knew we must slay wider and farther.And one by one we old men departed up river and down to the unknown lands.It was a brave thing.Old we were, and unafraid, but the fear of far places is a terrible fear to men who are old."
"“于是我们就巧妙地杀下去，毫不慌乱。不管是在奇尔库特，还是在德尔塔，从山口到海边，只要白人在那里宿营或者开路，我们就杀。不错，他们是死了，但是没有什么用。他们仍然会翻山过来，而且越来越多，而我们这些老头子，年纪大了，越来越少。我还记得，在驯鹿隘，有一个白人在那里扎了营。他是一个很矮小的白人，有三个老头子趁他睡着的时候去杀他。第二天，我遇到了他们四个人。只有那个白人还喘着气，他临死前还诅咒了我一通。","“So we slew, without haste and craftily.On the Chilcoot and in the Delta we slew, from the passes to the sea, wherever the white men camped or broke their trails.It be true, they died, but it was without worth.Ever did they come over the mountains, ever did they grow and grow, while we, being old, became less and less.I remember, by the Caribou Crossing, the camp of a white man.He was a very little white man, and three of the old men came upon him in his sleep.And the next day I came upon the four of them.The white man alone still breathed, and there was breath in him to curse me once and well before he died."
"“于是，就这样，今天这个老头子死了，明天那个老头子也死了。有时候，过了很久，我们才知道他们怎么死的，有时候，根本就没什么消息。而别的部族的老头子体弱又胆小，都不愿意和我们一块干。就像我说的，一个又一个都死了，直到最后剩下我一个人。我是英勃尔，怀特菲什人。我父亲是奥兹巴奥克，一条壮实的汉子。如今已经没有怀特菲什人了。我是最后一个怀特菲什的老头子。年轻的男人和女人都离开了，有的去跟佩利人一起生活，有的去跟萨蒙人一起生活，更多的是到白人那里去了。我年纪很大了，也很累了，就像你说的，霍坎，跟法律作对是白费力气，所以我就来自首了。”","“And so it went, now one old man, and now another.Sometimes the word reached us long after of how they died, and sometimes it did not reach us.And the old men of the other tribes were weak and afraid, and would not join with us.As I say, one by one, till I alone was left.I am Imber, of the Whitefish people.My father was Otsbaok, a strong man.There are no Whitefish now.Of the old men I am the last.The young men and young women are gone away, some to live with the Pellys, some with the Salmons, and more with the white men.I am very old, and very tired, and it being vain fighting the Law, as thou sayest, Howkan, I am come seeking the Law.”"
"“哦，英勃尔，你真傻。”霍坎说。但是英勃尔正在做梦。那个方脑门的法官也做起梦了，他的整个种族都站在他面前，像一个巨大的幻影——他们是脚穿钢靴，身披铁甲的种族，他们是人类各种族中制订法律，创造万物之人。他看见这个幻影在黎明闪烁着红光，穿过黑暗的森林和阴郁的海洋；他看见它发出血红的火光，变成饱满全盛的正午；然后他看见在隐蔽的斜坡下，血红的沙砾正在沉入夜色中。通过这一切，他看到了无情却有力的法律，永远不可改变，永远在发号施令，不仅比那些履行法律或者被法律压制的人强大，甚至比他还强大，他的心软了。","“O Imber, thou art indeed a fool,” said Howkan.But Imber was dreaming.The square-browed judge likewise dreamed, and all his race rose up before him in a mighty phantasmagoria—his steel-shod, mail-clad race, the lawgiver and world-maker among the families of men.He saw it dawn red-flickering across the dark forests and sullen seas; he saw it blaze, bloody and red, to full and triumphant noon; and down the shaded slope he saw the blood-red sands dropping into night.And through it all he observed the Law, pitiless and potent, ever unswerving and ever ordaining, greater than the motes of men who fulfilled it or were crushed by it, even as it was greater than he, his heart speaking for softness."
