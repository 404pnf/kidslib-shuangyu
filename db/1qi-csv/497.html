		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >经过一段疲劳之旅，穿过最后一片灌木丛和杂乱蔓生的小矮林，就步入了不毛之地的核心。那吝啬的北方大概是拒绝给予世人这片土地，但就在这里，人们会发现连绵不断的森林和绵延广阔的乐土。不过，世人才刚刚开始了解这些。世界上的探险家时常会发现这个地方，可至今也没有谁能回来告知世人。</td>
		<td class="en">A weary journey beyond the last scrub timber and straggling copses, into the heart of the Barrens where the niggard North is supposed to deny the Earth, are to be found great sweeps of forests and stretches of smiling land.But this the world is just beginning to know.The world’s explorers have known it, from time to time, but hitherto they have never returned to tell the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不毛之地——不错，它们是不毛之地，北极贫瘠之地，北极圈的荒漠，是麝牛和瘦骨嶙峋的平原狼惨淡寒冷的家。埃弗里·范布伦特发现的就是这样一副景象。这里没有树木，毫无生气，只是稀稀落落地长着些苔藓和地衣，完全没有任何吸引力。至少他看到的是这样，直到他进入了地图上的空白区，遇见了连做梦都未曾想到过的葱茏的杉木林和未被记载的爱斯基摩部落。他一直以来想做的（也是他扬名的方法）就是开辟这些空白区域，他要用黑色的标记区分出连绵的山脉、洼地、盆地和弯弯曲曲的河道。一想到可能还有林带和当地的村落，他就更高兴了。</td>
		<td class="en">The Barrens—well, they are the Barrens, the bad lands of the Arctic, the deserts of the Circle, the bleak and bitter home of the musk-ox and the lean plains wolf.So Avery Van Brunt found them, treeless and cheerless, sparsely clothed with moss and lichens, and altogether uninviting.At least so he found them till he penetrated to the white blank spaces on the map, and came upon undreamed-of rich spruce forests and unrecorded Eskimo tribes.It had been his intention, (and his bid for fame), to break up these white blank spaces and diversify them with the black markings of mountain-chains, sinks and basins, and sinuous river courses; and it was with added delight that he came to speculate upon the possibilities of timber belts and native villages.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃弗里·范布伦特，或者荣誉全称是地质勘探的埃·范布伦特教授，是这次远征的二把手，也是这个探险队分支的一把手。他已经带领这支考察队沿塞隆河的一条支流往上跋涉了约五百英里，现在他又带领着队伍深入了一个未经记载的村子。八个人在他身后沉重缓慢地走着，其中两个是法裔加拿大向导，剩下的都是来自马尼托巴的高大魁梧的克里人。只有他是血统纯正的撒克逊人，血液在血管中有力地搏动着，他的种族一直都是这样。克莱夫、黑斯廷斯、德雷克、罗利、亨吉斯特以及霍萨和他一块儿走着。他就要成为自己种族中进入北部地带这人迹罕至的村子的第一人了，想到这一点他一阵狂喜，不禁洋洋得意。跟在他后面的人发现他腿上的疲劳消失了，他还不知不觉地加快了步伐。</td>
		<td class="en">Avery Van Brunt, or, in full distinction, Professor A. Van Brunt of the Geological Survey, was second in command of the expedition, and first in command of the sub-expedition which he had led on a side tour of some half a thousand miles up one of the branches of the Thelon and which he was now leading into one of his unrecorded villages.At his back plodded eight men, two of them French-Canadian voyageurs, and the remainder strapping Crees from Manitoba-way.He, alone, was full-blooded Saxon, and his blood was pounding fiercely through his veins to the traditions of his race.Clive and Hastings, Drake and Raleigh, Hengest and Horsa, walked with him.First of all men of his breed was he to enter this lone Northland village, and at the thought an exultancy came upon him, an exaltation, and his followers noted that his leg-weariness fell from him and that he insensibly quickened the pace.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >整个村子的人都出来了，各色人等都成群结队地出来见他。男人在前面威胁地紧抓着弓和矛，妇女和孩子在后边怯生生地挪动着步子。范布伦特举起右臂，做出一个通用的表示和平的手势，这个手势所有的种族都看得懂，于是村民也友好地回应了。但让他懊恼的是，一个穿兽皮的人却跑上前来，伸出手并说了一句熟悉的“你好”。这个人留着胡子，脸颊和额头都晒成了古铜色。看见他，范布伦特就知道他来自哪个种族。</td>
		<td class="en">The village emptied itself, and a motley crowd trooped out to meet him, men in the forefront, with bows and spears clutched menacingly, and women and children faltering timidly in the rear.Van Brunt lifted his right arm and made the universal peace sign, a sign which all peoples know, and the villagers answered in peace.But to his chagrin, a skin-clad man ran forward and thrust out his hand with a familiar “Hello.”He was a bearded man, with cheeks and brow bronzed to copper-brown, and in him Van Brunt knew his kind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是谁？”他一边问一边握住了对方伸出的手。“安德烈吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Who are you?” he asked, gripping the extended hand.“Andrée?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁是安德烈？”他反问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Who’s Andrée?” the man asked back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范布伦特更加犀利地看着他。“天啊，你来这里有段时间了吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">Van Brunt looked at him more sharply.“By George, you’ve been here some time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“五年了。”这个人回答说，眼神里模糊地闪现着一种自豪。“走，咱们聊聊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Five years,” the man answered, a dim flicker of pride in his eyes.“But come on, let’s talk.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让他们就在我房子边上安营，”看到范布伦特瞥向他的同伴，这人说道，“老唐特拉奇会照顾好他们的。走吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Let them camp alongside of me,” he answered Van Brunt’s glance at his party.“Old Tantlatch will take care of them.Come on.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他迈开大步在前面轻松地走着，范布伦特紧跟在他后面，穿过了村子。村子里的房子建得并不齐整，只要是地势合适，鹿皮小屋就会在那里搭建起来。范布伦特老练地用眼睛一扫，估算了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">He swung off in a long stride, Van Brunt following at his heels through the village.In irregular fashion, wherever the ground favored, the lodges of moose hide were pitched.Van Brunt ran his practised eye over them and calculated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“两百个人，不包括孩子。”他算出了结果。</td>
		<td class="en">“Two hundred, not counting the young ones,” he summed up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个人点点头。“相当接近。这是我住的地方，远离村里人多的区域，你知道——这样有更多的私生活之类的。坐下来。等你们的人做好了饭，我要和你一起吃。我都记不得茶是什么滋味了……五年了，都没尝过一口，闻也没闻过……有烟吗？……啊，谢谢，有烟斗吗？不错。现在拿根火柴，我们就知道这烟草是不是失去它的魔力了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The man nodded.“Pretty close to it.But here’s where I live, out of the thick of it, you know—more privacy and all that.Sit down.I’ll eat with you when your men get something cooked up.I’ve forgotten what tea tastes like....Five years and never a taste or smell....Any tobacco?...Ah, thanks, and a pipe?Good.Now for a fire-stick and we’ll see if the weed has lost its cunning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他带着林居者的小心翼翼划着了火柴，呵护着小小的火苗，就好像这是世界上唯一的一簇似的，接着抽了第一口烟。他若有所思地把烟含在嘴里。过了一会儿，他撅起嘴缓缓地、轻柔地吐出一口烟。他往后一靠，表情似乎柔和了起来，接着一缕轻烟模糊了他的眼睛。他愉悦地深深叹了口气，夹杂着无比的满足感，接着，他突然说道：</td>
		<td class="en">He scratched the match with the painstaking care of the woodsman, cherished its young flame as though there were never another in all the world, and drew in the first mouthful of smoke.This he retained meditatively for a time, and blew out through his pursed lips slowly and caressingly.Then his face seemed to soften as he leaned back, and a soft blur to film his eyes.He sighed heavily, happily, with immeasurable content, and then said suddenly:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“上帝啊！不过抽起来还真不赖！”</td>
		<td class="en">“God!But that tastes good!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范布伦特同情地点点头。“五年，你说的是五年吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">Van Brunt nodded sympathetically.“Five years, you say?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是五年了。”这个人又叹了一口气。“我猜，你应该想知道这个，你天生好奇，而且这里的情形还有其他种种都很不可思议。不过也没有什么可说的。我跟随着麝牛从埃德蒙顿来，和派克以及其他人一样，我也有自己的不幸，只是我和自己的队伍走散了，装备也丢了。你知道的，挨饿、受苦这都是常事，仅有的一个幸存者等诸如此类的情况，直到我手脚并用爬到了唐特拉奇家，也就是这里。</td>
		<td class="en">“Five years.”The man sighed again.“And you, I presume, wish to know about it, being naturally curious, and this a sufficiently strange situation, and all that.But it’s not much.I came in from Edmonton after musk-ox, and like Pike and the rest of them, had my mischances, only I lost my party and outfit.Starvation, hardship, the regular tale, you know, sole survivor and all that, till I crawled into Tantlatch’s, here, on hand and knee.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“五年了，”范布伦特讷讷地说着，回忆着，像是好些事情正在脑海中翻腾。</td>
		<td class="en">“Five years,” Van Brunt murmured retrospectively, as though turning things over in his mind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“离刚过去的二月份已经有五年了。我于五月初穿过了大奴湖——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Five years on February last.I crossed the Great Slave early in May—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是……费尔法克斯？”范布伦特打断说。</td>
		<td class="en">“And you are...Fairfax?” Van Brunt interjected.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个人点点头。</td>
		<td class="en">The man nodded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让我想想……约翰，我想是的，约翰·费尔法克斯。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Let me see...John, I think it is, John Fairfax.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你怎么知道的？”费尔法克斯懒懒地问，漫不经心地盯着烟圈在平静的空气里升腾。</td>
		<td class="en">“How did you know?”Fairfax queried lazily, half-absorbed in curling smoke-spirals upward in the quiet air.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那时候报纸上到处都讲这个。普雷旺——”</td>
		<td class="en">“The papers were full of it at the time. Prevanche—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“普雷旺！”费尔法克斯坐直了身子，突然间警觉起来。“他在斯莫克山脉那儿走丢了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Prevanche!” Fairfax sat up, suddenly alert.“He was lost in the Smoke Mountains.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，可他脱离了险境，还走了出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, but he pulled through and came out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >费尔法克斯又坐下，接着吐着烟圈。“听到这个我很高兴，”他沉思着说。“普雷旺是个恶棍，就算他知道怎么包扎脑袋，这个家伙。你说他脱离了险境？嗯，我挺高兴的。”</td>
		<td class="en">Fairfax settled back again and resumed his smoke-spirals.“I am glad to hear it,” he remarked reflectively.“Prevanche was a bully fellow if he did have ideas about head-straps, the beggar.And he pulled through?Well, I’m glad.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >五年了……这句话在范布伦特的思绪中回荡，不知怎的埃米莉·索思韦兹的脸好像冒了出来，呈现在他眼前。五年了……排成人字形的野禽鸣叫着，从头顶低空飞过，一见到露营地就往北急转，飞向了闷燃着的太阳。范布伦特的眼睛没法跟上它们。他掏出手表。午夜都过了一个钟头了。云团猛烈地向北涌动，暗红色的光射向南面，照得阴沉沉的森林闪耀出火红色的光辉。 宁静的空气叫人喘不过气来，帐篷里一丁点儿声音听起来都像号角声一样清楚。克里人和向导感觉到了这种氛围，梦幻般含糊地低语着，厨师也不知不觉压低了锅盆的声响。某个地方有个小孩在哭，而从森林的深处响起一个妇人的声音，像根银丝线似的，悲切地唱着：“噢……啊哈……，噢……啊哈……”</td>
		<td class="en">Five years...the phrase drifted recurrently through Van Brunt’s thought, and somehow the face of Emily Southwaithe seemed to rise up and take form before him.Five years...A wedge of wild-fowl honked low overhead and at sight of the encampment veered swiftly to the north into the smouldering sun.Van Brunt could not follow them.He pulled out his watch.It was an hour past midnight.The northward clouds flushed bloodily, and rays of sombre-red shot southward, firing the gloomy woods with a lurid radiance.The air was in breathless calm, not a needle quivered, and the least sounds of the camp were distinct and clear as trumpet calls.The Crees and voyageurs felt the spirit of it and mumbled in dreamy undertones, and the cook unconsciously subdued the clatter of pot and pan.Somewhere a child was crying, and from the depths of the forest, like a silver thread, rose a woman’s voice in mournful chant: “O-o-o-o-o-o-a-haa-ha-a-ha-aa-a-a, O-o-o-o-o-o-a-ha-a-ha-a.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范布伦特颤抖着，迅速地搓了搓手背。</td>
		<td class="en">Van Brunt shivered and rubbed the backs of his hands briskly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们当我死了，所以放弃我了？”他的同伴慢慢地问。</td>
		<td class="en">“And they gave me up for dead?” his companion asked slowly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唔，你一直没回来，所以你的朋友——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, you never came back, so your friends—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很快就忘了。”费尔法克斯刺耳地笑了笑，笑声中带着不屑。</td>
		<td class="en">“Promptly forgot.”Fairfax laughed harshly, defiantly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你为什么不出来？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why didn’t you come out?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想，一部分是因为我不愿出去，一部分是因为那些我无法控制的情形。你知道，我在这里认识唐特拉奇时，他拖着一条伤腿卧病在床——骨折得很严重——是我给他接好了腿，又帮他康复。我也呆了一段时间，恢复了气力。我是他见到的第一个白人，当然我看起来很聪明，我也教了他们无数的东西。其中就有军事战略训练，所以他们攻下了另外四个部落，（你还没看到那几个部落），然后统治了这片土地。渐渐地，他们自然就很看重我，非常看重，所以我准备要走的时候，他们不愿意听到这个消息。实际上，他们是非常好客的。他们派了两个守卫日日夜夜守着我。接着唐特拉奇还开出了具有诱惑力的条件——从某种意义来讲，是诱惑——可以这么说，又因为走不走其实都没什么要紧的，我就安心留了下来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Partly disinclination, I suppose, and partly because of circumstances over which I had no control.You see, Tantlatch, here, was down with a broken leg when I made his acquaintance,—a nasty fracture,—and I set it for him and got him into shape.I stayed some time, getting my strength back.I was the first white man he had seen, and of course I seemed very wise and showed his people no end of things.Coached them up in military tactics, among other things, so that they conquered the four other tribal villages, (which you have not yet seen), and came to rule the land.And they naturally grew to think a good deal of me, so much so that when I was ready to go they wouldn’t hear of it.Were most hospitable, in fact.Put a couple of guards over me and watched me day and night.And then Tantlatch offered me inducements,—in a sense, inducements,—so to say, and as it didn’t matter much one way or the other, I reconciled myself to remaining.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我认识你在弗赖堡的兄弟。我是范布伦特。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I knew your brother at Freiburg.I am Van Brunt.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >费尔法克斯突然冲动地往前一倾，握住他的手。“你是比利的朋友，嗯？可怜的比利！他常提起你。”</td>
		<td class="en">Fairfax reached forward impulsively and shook his hand.“You were Billy’s friend, eh?Poor Billy!He spoke of you often.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过在这种地方遇见还真是挺离奇的。”他补充了一句，同时欣然地浏览着这原始的景致，并倾听了片刻女人悲切的曲调。“她男人让熊给撕了，她很难受。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rum meeting place, though,” he added, casting an embracing glance over the primordial landscape and listening for a moment to the woman’s mournful notes.“Her man was clawed by a bear, and she’s taking it hard.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“野蛮的生活！”范布伦特的脸扭曲起来，满是厌恶的表情。“我猜，在这儿呆了五年之后，会觉得现代舒适的生活很美妙吧？你说呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Beastly life!” Van Brunt grimaced his disgust.“I suppose, after five years of it, civilization will be sweet?What do you say?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >费尔法克斯的脸上表情淡漠。“啊，我不知道。至少他们是诚实的人，按照他们自己的处世之道生活。他们也惊人地简单。他们一点儿也不复杂，所经历的任何情感不会有许许多多的微妙的纠葛。他们爱、恐惧、怨恨或者快乐，说的都是平常通用的话，不会出什么错。这也许是比较原始的生活，可至少在这里生活很容易。无需调情，也不会玩弄感情。要是一个女人喜欢你，她不会因为害羞而不告诉你。她要是恨你，就会这么跟你说；如果你愿意，你可以教训她，可问题是她清楚地知道你怎么想的，你也清楚地知道她是什么意思。不会弄错，也没有误会。在那种舒适文明的生活所带来的阵阵狂热过后，这种生活自有一种魅力。懂吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">Fairfax’s face took on a stolid expression.“Oh, I don’t know.At least they’re honest folk and live according to their lights.And then they are amazingly simple.No complexity about them, no thousand and one subtle ramifications to every single emotion they experience.They love, fear, hate, are angered, or made happy, in common, ordinary, and unmistakable terms.It may be a beastly life, but at least it is easy to live.No philandering, no dallying.If a woman likes you, she’ll not be backward in telling you so.If she hates you, she’ll tell you so, and then, if you feel inclined, you can beat her, but the thing is, she knows precisely what you mean, and you know precisely what she means.No mistakes, no misunderstandings.It has its charm, after civilization’s fitful fever.Comprehend?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，这里的生活相当好了，”顿了顿，他又接着说，“对我来说够好了，我打算呆下去。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, it’s a pretty good life,” he continued, after a pause; “good enough for me, and I intend to stay with it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范布伦特沉思着低下了头，嘴角露出一丝难以察觉的笑意。不用调情，不会玩弄感情，也没有误会。费尔法克斯还真是很放在心上，他想，就是因为埃米莉·索思韦兹阴差阳错地被熊掳走了。不过这熊倒不坏，她丈夫卡尔顿· 索思韦兹也是。</td>
		<td class="en">Van Brunt lowered his head in a musing manner, and an imperceptible smile played on his mouth.No philandering, no dallying, no misunderstanding.Fairfax also was taking it hard, he thought, just because Emily Southwaithe had been mistakenly clawed by a bear.And not a bad sort of a bear, either, was Carlton Southwaithe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可你会跟我走。”范布伦特从容不迫地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“But you are coming along with me,” Van Brunt said deliberately.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，我不会跟你走。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, I’m not.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“会的，你会的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, you are.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我得告诉你，这里的生活很舒服。”费尔法克斯坚定地说，“我明白这儿的一切，别人也理解我。冬夏交替就像太阳掠过篱笆的栅栏，四季往复就是恍惚间光阴的转换，时间飞驰，生命流转，之后……森林就会传来哀泣，在黑暗里。你听！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Life’s too easy here, I tell you.” Fairfax spoke with decision.“I understand everything, and I am understood.Summer and winter alternate like the sun flashing through the palings of a fence, the seasons are a blur of light and shade, and time slips by, and life slips by, and then...a wailing in the forest, and the dark. Listen!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他抬起手来，女人的哀泣如同一条银丝穿破了沉静和冷寂。费尔法克斯轻声地应和着。</td>
		<td class="en">He held up his hand, and the silver thread of the woman’s sorrow rose through the silence and the calm.Fairfax joined in softly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢……啊哈……噢……啊哈……”他吟唱道，“你听不见吗？你听不懂吗？那个女人在悼念——那葬礼上的悲吟——我已白发苍苍、年高德劭——我全身被裹，粗糙然而华丽——我那狩猎用的矛就在我身边。谁又能说不好呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“O-o-o-o-o-o-a-haa-ha-a-ha-aa-a-a, O-o-o-o-o-o-a-ha-a-ha-a,” he sang.“Can’t you hear it?Can’t you see it?The women mourning.—the funeral chant.—my hair white-locked and patriarchal.—my skins wrapped in rude splendor about me.—my hunting-spear by my side.And who shall say it is not well?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范布伦特冷冷地看着他。“费尔法克斯，你他妈的就是个傻子。这样的生活过了五年，足以击倒任何人了，你现在的状态并不健康，是病态的。再说，卡尔顿·索思韦兹也死了啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">Van Brunt looked at him coolly.“Fairfax, you are a damned fool.Five years of this is enough to knock any man, and you are in an unhealthy, morbid condition.Further, Carlton Southwaithe is dead.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范布伦特装好烟袋点着，带着几乎由于职业而养成的兴趣，狡黠地盯着他。费尔法克斯的眼睛立马就亮了起来；他攥紧了拳头，都快要站起来了，可紧接着肌肉松弛了下来，他好像陷入了沉思。厨师迈克尔打手势说饭做好了，可是范布伦特回了个手势说晚些再吃。沉沉的寂静，他开始去体会森林的气味，感受霉和腐烂草木的味道，松果和松针的清香，还有帐篷里缕缕青烟的芳香。费尔法克斯两次抬起头，可什么也没说，接着：</td>
		<td class="en">Van Brunt filled his pipe and lighted it, the while watching slyly and with almost professional interest.Fairfax’s eyes flashed on the instant, his fists clenched, he half rose up, then his muscles relaxed and he seemed to brood.Michael, the cook, signalled that the meal was ready, but Van Brunt motioned back to delay.The silence hung heavy, and he fell to analyzing the forest scents, the odors of mould and rotting vegetation, the resiny smells of pine cones and needles, the aromatic savors of many camp-smokes.Twice Fairfax looked up, but said nothing, and then:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那……埃米莉……？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And...Emily...?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“守了三年的寡，现在还在守寡。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Three years a widow; still a widow.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >又是一阵长长的沉寂，最后终于给费尔福克斯天真地一笑打破了。“我想你说得对，范布伦特。我要和你一起回去。”</td>
		<td class="en">Another long silence settled down, to be broken by Fairfax finally with a naïve smile.“I guess you’re right, Van Brunt.I’ll go along.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就知道你会的。”范布伦特把手搭到费尔法克斯的肩膀上。“当然了，谁也不知道，不过我猜想——像她这种情形——有不少人求婚——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I knew you would.”Van Brunt laid his hand on Fairfax’s shoulder.“Of course, one cannot know, but I imagine—for one in her position—she has had offers—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你什么时候动身？”费尔法克斯打断他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“When do you start?” Fairfax interrupted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“等我那伙人睡一会儿吧。这倒提醒我了，迈克尔要发火了，赶紧去吃饭吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“After the men have had some sleep.Which reminds me, Michael is getting angry, so come and eat.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吃过晚饭，克里人和林居者们钻进了毯子，打着呼噜，范布伦特和费尔法克斯却还逗留在渐渐熄灭的火堆旁。有好多要谈论的——战争、政治、探险，人们都做了什么，又发生了什么事情，他们共有的朋友、各种婚姻、各种死亡——费尔法克斯嚷着想知道的过去五年的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">After supper, when the Crees and voyageurs had rolled into their blankets, snoring, the two men lingered by the dying fire.There was much to talk about,—wars and politics and explorations, the doings of men and the happening of things, mutual friends, marriages, deaths,—five years of history for which Fairfax clamored.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“因此西班牙舰队被困在了圣地亚哥。”范布伦特正说着，一个年轻的女人从他跟前轻轻地走过，站在了费尔法克斯身旁。她匆匆看了一下他的脸，接着又心事重重地盯着范布伦特看。</td>
		<td class="en">“So the Spanish fleet was bottled up in Santiago,” Van Brunt was saying, when a young woman stepped lightly before him and stood by Fairfax’s side.She looked swiftly into his face, then turned a troubled gaze upon Van Brunt.</td></tr>
