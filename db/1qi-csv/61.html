		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >前些日子我在一个美术展上看到一幅已以五千美元售出的画。画家是一位名叫克拉夫特的年轻西部二流画家，他有钟爱的食粮和引以为豪的理论。他的食粮是对自然界那万无一失的艺术调节能力不熄的信念。他的理论固定于腌牛肉末和水煮蛋。这幅画背后有一个故事，我便回家提起钢笔把它写了下来。克拉夫特的想法——不过，那还不是故事的开端。　</td>
		<td class="en">In an art exhibition the other day I saw a painting that had been sold for $5,000.The painter was a young scrub out of the West named Kraft, who had a favourite food and a pet theory.His pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature.His theory was fixed around corned-beef hash with poached egg.There was a story behind the picture, so I went home and let it drip out of a fountain-pen.The idea of Kraft—but that is not the beginning of the story.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >三年前我和克拉夫特、比尔·贾金斯（一位诗人）常在第八大道的塞弗餐馆吃饭。我说的是“吃饭”。我们有钱的时候，塞弗让我们“掏”出来，他如此说。我们不能佘账；我们走进餐馆，叫了餐，吃完。我们有时付账，有时不付。我们对塞弗的阴沉和郁积的凶猛深信不疑。在他阴暗的心灵深处，他要么是一个王子，要么是一个傻瓜，要么是一个艺术家。他坐在虫蛀的桌子旁，桌上堆着一叠叠陈旧的侍者账单，我敢肯定最底下那份定是当年亨德里克·哈得孙吃蛤蚌所付的账单。塞弗有着和拿破仑三世和突眼鲈鱼一样的能力，能让双眼覆上一层薄膜，让这对心灵的窗户变得模糊。有一回我们找了个极糟的借口不付帐就走人，我回头时看见他那薄膜后面透出一阵几不可闻的笑声，笑得浑身直抖。时不时地我们也付清欠债。</td>
		<td class="en">Three years ago Kraft, Bill Judkins (a poet), and I took our meals at Cypher’s, on Eighth Avenue.I say “took.”When we had money, Cypher got it “off of” us, as he expressed it.We had no credit; we went in, called for food and ate it.We paid or we did not pay.We had confidence in Cypher’s sullenness and smouldering ferocity.Deep down in his sunless soul he was either a prince, a fool or an artist.He sat at a worm-eaten desk, covered with files of waiters’ checks so old that I was sure the bottomest one was for clams that Hendrik Hudson had eaten and paid for.Cypher had the power, in common with Napoleon III. and the goggle-eyed perch, of throwing a film over his eyes, rendering opaque the windows of his soul.Once when we left him unpaid, with egregious excuses, I looked back and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film.Now and then we paid up back scores.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但塞弗餐馆最重要的还是米利。她是个侍者。她是克拉夫特自然之艺术调节理论的绝佳阐释。她主要属于侍应这一行，正如密涅瓦属于争斗的艺术或维纳斯属于庄重调情的学问一样。若铸她为青铜像，置于座上，她也可能跻身于她那些最高贵的英勇的姐妹中，因为“肝尖和熏肉令世界活力无限。”她属于塞弗餐馆。你期待在油炸锅上氤氲的蓝色烟雾里看见她壮硕的身躯浮现出来，就像你期待帕利塞兹丘陵隐现于哈得孙河面漂流的雾气中一样。在那蔬菜和火腿蛋的蒸汽、食器的碰撞声、钢质餐具的撞击声、“快餐”的尖嚷声、饥饿食客的叫喊声和所有进餐者的可怕喧哗声里，在法老遗留给我们的一群群嗡嗡飞舞的苍蝇围绕中，米利像一艘大邮轮在咆哮的野蛮人的独木舟间壮观地破浪前行。</td>
		<td class="en">But the chief thing at Cypher’s was Milly.Milly was a waitress.She was a grand example of Kraft’s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature.She belonged, largely, to waiting, as Minerva did to the art of scrapping, or Venus to the science of serious flirtation.Pedestalled and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as “Liver-and-Bacon Enlivening the World.”She belonged to Cypher’s.You expected to see her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the Palisades to appear through a drifting Hudson River fog.There amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of “ham and,” the crash of crockery, the clatter of steel, the screaming of “short orders,” the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man, surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by Pharaoh, Milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们的食物女神气势如此庄严宏伟，令人不由得敬畏。她的袖管总是卷到胳膊肘之上。她可以用双手提起我们这三个火枪手，把我们丢出窗外。她比我们任何一个都年轻，但却具有非同一般的夏娃情怀，而且纯朴率直，从一开始就像母亲般照顾我们。她从塞弗餐馆的食品储藏室取给我们食物，颇有皇家气派，从不计较价格和数目，仿佛那里是丰饶之角，取之不尽。她的声音洪如银钟；经常微笑，笑时露出许多牙齿，仿佛山顶一轮金色的朝阳。我一见到她就会想到约塞米蒂。但不知怎么，我无法想象她在塞弗餐馆外生存的情况。自然把她安置在那里，她生了根并茁壮成长。她似乎很幸福，每周六晚领到几美元可怜的薪水时，都像个意外得到赠品的孩子一样高兴得涨红了脸。</td>
		<td class="en">Our Goddess of Grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe.Her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows.She could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window.She had seen fewer years than any of us, but she was of such superb Evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the beginning.Cypher’s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity, as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion.Her voice rang like a great silver bell; her smile was many-toothed and frequent; she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain tops.I never saw her but I thought of the Yosemite.And yet, somehow, I could never think of her as existing outside of Cypher’s.There nature had placed her, and she had taken root and grown mightily.She seemed happy, and took her few poor dollars on Saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克拉夫特第一个说出了我们每人的隐忧。当然，这是我们在讨论某些艺术问题时恰巧提起的。我们中的一个把海顿交响乐和开心果冰淇淋间存在的和谐比作米利和塞弗餐馆间的美妙协调。</td>
		<td class="en">It was Kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently.It came up apropos, of course, of certain questions of art at which we were hammering.One of us compared the harmony existing between a Haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between Milly and Cypher’s.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“某种命运笼罩着米利，”克拉夫特说，“它一旦压下，塞弗餐馆和我们都要失去她。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There is a certain fate hanging over Milly,” said Kraft, “and if it overtakes her she is lost to Cypher’s and to us.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她会发胖？”贾金斯战战兢兢地问。</td>
		<td class="en">“She will grow fat?” asked Judkins, fearsomely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她要去夜校念书提高文化？”我不安地试探。</td>
		<td class="en">“She will go to night school and become refined?” I ventured anxiously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是这样的，”克拉夫特僵硬的手指在溅到桌面的一滩咖啡里点着。“凯撒有他的布鲁特斯——棉花有棉铃虫，歌舞女郎有匹兹堡阔佬，夏天度假寄宿者有毒葛，英雄有卡内基勋章，艺术品有摩根，玫瑰有——”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is this,” said Kraft, punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger.“Caesar had his Brutus—the cotton has its bollworm, the chorus girl has her Pittsburger, the summer boarder has his poison ivy, the hero has his Carnegie medal, art has its Morgan, the rose has its—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喂，”我非常烦躁地打断他，“你不会是认为米利要结婚吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Speak,” I interrupted, much perturbed.“You do not think that Milly will begin to lace?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“总有一天，”克拉夫特严肃地下了结论，“会有一位家财万贯的威斯康星伐木人来到塞弗餐馆点一盘豆，他会娶走米利。”</td>
		<td class="en">“One day,” concluded Kraft, solemnly, “there will come to Cypher’s for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from Wisconsin, and he will marry Milly.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“绝不可以！”贾金斯和我一起惊慌地嚷道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Never!” exclaimed Judkins and I, in horror.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一个伐木人。”克拉夫特嘶哑地重复。</td>
		<td class="en">“A lumberman,” repeated Kraft, hoarsely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还是一个家财万贯的伐木人！”我绝望地叹气。</td>
		<td class="en">“And a millionaire lumberman!” I sighed, despairingly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“威斯康星来的！”贾金斯叹息道。</td>
		<td class="en">“From Wisconsin!” groaned Judkins.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们一致觉得这可怕的命运像在威胁着她。没有什么事是不可能的。米利就像是一大片尚未采伐的松林,必定会引起伐木人的注意。我们很清楚威斯康星人的习性，一旦好运青睐了他们。他们就直奔纽约，把货物放在廉价餐馆里替他们端来豆子的姑娘脚边。唉，连字母表本身都来共谋。星期日报标题记者的工作内容也已被准备好了。</td>
		<td class="en">We agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her.Few things were less improbable.Milly, like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods, was made to catch the lumberman’s eye.And well we knew the habits of the Badgers, once fortune smiled upon them.Straight to New York they hie, and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery.Why, the alphabet itself connives.The Sunday newspaper’s headliner’s work is cut for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“威斯康星伐木巨富情归迷人侍应女郎。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Winsome Waitress Wins Wealthy Wisconsin Woodsman.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有那么一会儿，我们觉得我们马上要失去米利。</td>
		<td class="en">For a while we felt that Milly was on the verge of being lost to us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正是我们对自然万无一失的艺术调节的热爱鼓舞了我们。我们不能把她交托给一个伐木人，他有钱而又土气，这使他显得加倍地令人讨厌。想到米利调整了声音，袖子不再高高卷起，在一个树木谋杀者的大理石圆锥形帐篷下斟茶的情形，我们就发抖。不！她属于塞弗餐馆——属于熏肉烟气、卷心菜香味，属于硬质瓷器和调味瓶的碰撞声合成的瓦格纳大合唱。</td>
		<td class="en">It was our love of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature that inspired us.We could not give her over to a lumberman, doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism.We shuddered to think of Milly, with her voice modulated and her elbows covered, pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer.No!In Cypher’s she belonged—in the bacon smoke, the cabbage perfume, the grand, Wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们的担心定有预言性，因为当天晚上，命中注定来没收米利的人就从原始森林中走出，来到我们身边——这就是我们支付的自然调节的费用。但来者不是威斯康星人，而是阿拉斯加人。</td>
		<td class="en">Our fears must have been prophetic, for on that same evening the wildwood discharged upon us Milly’s preordained confiscator—our fee to adjustment and order.But Alaska and not Wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那时我们正在吃晚餐，吃的是炖牛肉和苹果脯，他像赶着狗拉雪橇队一般快步小跑了进来，不顾满桌狼藉，成为我们中的一员。他像在露营似的肆意高声喧哗，像在廉价餐馆的狂热中迷失的人遇到了伙伴似的和我们攀谈。我们拥抱了那个怪家伙，不出三分钟，我们就成了生死相依的好友。</td>
		<td class="en">We were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the heels of a dog team, and made one of the mess at our table.With the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house.We embraced him as a specimen, and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他很健壮，留着胡子，久经风霜。他说他刚离开“铁道”，从北河一个渡口而来。我仿佛能看到奇尔科特的雪粒还洒在他的肩头。然后他像归来的克朗代克淘金者一样在桌面摊满了金砖、瓤松鸡、珠球刺绣和海豹毛皮，开始和我们唠叨他的数百万家产。</td>
		<td class="en">He was rugged and bearded and wind-dried.He had just come off the “trail,” he said, at one of the North River ferries.I fancied I could see the snow dust of Chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders.And then he strewed the table with the nuggets, stuffed ptarmigans, bead work and seal pelts of the returned Klondiker, and began to prate to us of his millions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我有两百万的银行汇票，”他总结道，“我拥有的开采权每天能带来一千元的进账。现在我想吃些炖牛肉和桃罐头。狗拉雪撬把我带到西雅图，搭上火车后我从没下来过，我饿极了。普尔曼卧铺车上黑人侍者给你吃的根本不能算东西。你们只点你们想吃的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Bank drafts for two millions,” was his summing up, “and a thousand a day piling up from my claims.And now I want some beef stew and canned peaches.I never got off the train since I mushed out of Seattle, and I’m hungry.The stuff the niggers feed you on Pullmans don’t count.You gentlemen order what you want.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，卷起袖管的胳膊上叠着许多盘子的米利出现了——高大而庄严，肤色白里泛着红，如同圣埃利亚斯山一般——她的笑容则像是峡谷的黎明。克朗代克淘金者的毛皮金砖被弃如糟粕，他耷拉着下巴，目不转睛地盯着她。你几乎已经看到米利戴上了他打算买给她的钻冠，穿上了巴黎手工刺绣的丝质礼服。</td>
		<td class="en">And then Milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm—loomed up big and white and pink and awful as Mount Saint Elias—with a smile like day breaking in a gulch.And the Klondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross, and let his jaw fall half-way, and stared at her.You could almost see the diamond tiaras on Milly’s brow and the hand-embroidered silk Paris gowns that he meant to buy for her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >棉铃虫终于侵害了棉花——毒葛伸出卷须缠住夏日度假寄宿者——貌似阿拉斯加采矿者的家财万贯的伐木人即将要吞噬我们的米利，扰乱自然的调节。</td>
		<td class="en">At last the bollworm had attacked the cotton—the poison ivy was reaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder—the millionaire lumberman, thinly disguised as the Alaskan miner, was about to engulf our Milly and upset Nature’s adjustment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克拉夫特第一个采取行动。他突然站了起来，重重地拍了拍克朗代克淘金者的背。“咱们去外头喝几杯，”他大声说，“先喝酒，再吃饭。”贾金斯抓住他的一条胳膊，我拽了另一条。我们把他香喷喷的松鸡和难以消化的金砖塞进他口袋，不由他分说，欢快又吵吵嚷嚷地把他从餐馆拽到了一家咖啡馆。</td>
		<td class="en">Kraft was the first to act.He leaped up and pounded the Klondiker’s back.“Come out and drink,” he shouted.“Drink first and eat afterward.”Judkins seized one arm and I the other.Gaily, roaringly, irresistibly, in jolly-good-fellow style, we dragged him from the restaurant to a café, stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在那里，他声音低沉地提出了愉快的抗议。“那正是我中意的姑娘，”他宣布说，“她后半辈子可以和我在一个锅里吃饭。哎呀，我从没见过这么好的姑娘。　我要回那儿向她求婚。我想当她看到我积攒的那堆钱，就不会再想当端盘子的侍者了。”</td>
		<td class="en">There he rumbled a roughly good-humoured protest.“That’s the girl for my money,” he declared.“She can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life.Why, I never see such a fine girl.I’m going back there and ask her to marry me.I guess she won’t want to sling hash any more when she sees the pile of dust I’ve got.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你现在再喝一杯加奶威士忌吧，”克拉夫特带着撒旦的微笑怂恿着。“我以为你们内地的人更能喝。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ll take another whiskey and milk now,” Kraft persuaded, with Satan’s smile.“I thought you up-country fellows were better sports.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克拉夫特把他存下的可怜的几枚硬币都买了酒，然后哀求地望着贾金斯和我，我们只得掏钱买酒敬我们的客人，直至掏尽最后一枚硬币。</td>
		<td class="en">Kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave Judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我们弹尽粮绝时，克朗代克人尚有几分清醒，又开始喋喋不休地谈起米利，克拉夫特在他耳边说了句客气的侮辱话，讽刺吝啬的有钱人，使得这采矿人一把把地甩出银币和钞票，要用世上所有的酒水溺毙这诋毁。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, when our ammunition was gone and the Klondiker, still somewhat sober, began to babble again of Milly, Kraft whispered into his ear such a polite, barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds, that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes, calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样才大功告成。用他的弹药，我们把他逐出了战场。然后我们用车把他推到一个很远的小旅馆，安顿他上了床，把金砖和海豹幼崽毛皮堆在他身旁。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus the work was accomplished.With his own guns we drove him from the field.And then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby seal-skins stuffed around him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他再也找不着塞弗餐馆了，”克拉夫特说，“明天他会向在甜品店里看到的第一个穿白围裙的姑娘求婚的。米利——我是说自然调节——得救了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“He will never find Cypher’s again,” said Kraft.“He will propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to-morrow.And Milly—I mean the Natural Adjustment—is saved!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们三个回到塞弗餐馆，发现没几个客人了，我们拉着手围着米利跳了一段印第安舞。</td>
		<td class="en">And back to Cypher’s went we three, and, finding customers scarce, we joined hands and did an Indian dance with Milly in the centre.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我说过，这事发生在三年前。那之后不久，我们三个人走了点好运，都能吃得起比塞弗餐馆贵却不及那里健康的食物了。我们各奔东西，我再也没见过克拉夫特，也不常看到贾金斯。</td>
		<td class="en">This, I say, happened three years ago.And about that time a little luck descended upon us three, and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than Cypher’s.Our paths separated, and I saw Kraft no more and Judkins seldom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但就如我说过的，几天前，我看到一幅已以五千美元售出的画作。画的标题是“博阿迪西亚”，画像体形似要占满一切空间。但在伫立于画前的所有仰慕者中，我相信只有我渴望博阿迪西亚从她的画框里走出，替我端来腌牛肉末和水煮蛋。</td>
		<td class="en">But, as I said, I saw a painting the other day that was sold for $5,000.The title was “Boadicea,” and the figure seemed to fill all out-of-doors.But of all the picture’s admirers who stood before it, I believe I was the only one who longed for Boadicea to stalk from her frame, bringing me corned-beef hash with poached egg.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我匆忙赶去见克拉夫特。他撒旦般的眼睛一如既往，头发更乱了，只是衣服却是裁缝替他量身定制的。</td>
		<td class="en">I hurried away to see Kraft.His satanic eyes were the same, his hair was worse tangled, but his clothes had been made by a tailor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我都不知道呢。”我对他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I didn’t know,” I said to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们用卖画的钱在布朗克斯买了栋小别墅，”他说，“晚上七点以后，随时欢迎来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“We’ve bought a cottage in the Bronx with the money,” said he.“Any evening at 7.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，”我说，“当初你领头对付那个伐木人——那个克朗代克人——的时候，不完全是为了自然界那万无一失的艺术调节？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then,” said I, “when you led us against the lumberman—the—Klondiker—it wasn’t altogether on account of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，不完全是。”克拉夫特咧着嘴笑着说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, not altogether,” said Kraft, with a grin.</td></tr>
