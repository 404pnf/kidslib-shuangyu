"古老的泰孔德罗加——一幅历史的画卷","Old Ticonderoga: A Picture of The Past"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"这附近最吸引人的景色就是著名的泰孔德罗加古要塞，从客栈阳台上就能看见它的遗址，它坐落在一片山丘之上，山丘的尽头是一片湖光山景。反抗山和独立山是这一带有名的山峰，历史上所有的美国人都很熟悉它们。尽管这两座山都不太符合它们的名字给人的想象，但还是特别引人注目，无人不识。说实话，除了要塞内部，这整个景色都很让我失望。反抗山，名字会让人联想到一座陡峭高耸、崎岖不平的山峰，令人望而生畏，嶙峋的峭壁犹如狰狞的面容，俯视着古老的泰孔德罗加要塞，但事实上，它只不过是一段绵长、树木繁茂的山脊，甚至之前曾一度享有“糖山”这个温柔的名字。要登顶的确困难，山坡的高度也足以鸟瞰要塞的每个角落。但是，圣克莱尔之所以没有攻占这座山，最可能的原因应该是兵力不足，无法在已有的工事中分兵把守，而非像传说的那样，反抗山高不可攀。奇怪的是，法国人从未在这个高地筑防御工事，而只是驻扎在他们已经找到的英军前进的区域。","The greatest attraction, in this vicinity, is the famous old fortress of Ticonderoga, the remains of which are visible from the piazza of the tavern, on a swell of land that shuts in the prospect of the lake.Those celebrated heights, Mount Defiance and Mount Independence, familiar to all Americans in history, stand too prominent not to be recognized, though neither of them precisely corresponds to the images excited by their names.In truth, the whole scene, except the interior of the fortress, disappointed me.Mount Defiance, which one pictures as a steep, lofty, and rugged hill, of most formidable aspect, frowning down with the grim visage of a precipice on old Ticonderoga, is merely a long and wooded ridge; and bore, at some former period, the gentle name of Sugar Hill.The brow is certainly difficult to climb, and high enough to look into every corner of the fortress.St. Clair’s most probable reason, however, for neglecting to occupy it, was the deficiency of troops to man the works already constructed, rather than the supposed inaccessibility of Mount Defiance.It is singular that the French never fortified this height, standing, as it does, in the quarter whence they must have looked for the advance of a British army."
"我第一次参观古要塞遗址时，有一位刚从西点军校毕业的年轻中尉给我做了详尽系统的解说。他在军校时是名工程兵，曾因卓越的军事才华受到褒奖。但大多数让他兴致勃勃的地方在我看来却一头雾水：线条笔直或者曲折交错，防筑之中又另有防筑，墙壁相对抑或壕沟相交；地面下是长方形的石料工事，工事之上则堆砌着高大的土堆或是覆盖着草皮的石丘。在其中一座人工山丘上，一棵松树生根发芽、茁壮成长，因为旗杆已被推倒了。但是，我这一介平民的眼睛认为平淡无奇、杂乱无章的地方，这年轻的中尉却如数家珍、津津乐道。他推测着每条壕沟的军事用途，凭借着已毁灭近半的线条勾画出整个要塞的平面图。他对泰孔德罗加的描述如同几何定理一样精确无误，但当中的诗意却荒芜得像这废墟一般。在我眼中，泰孔德罗加虽已沦为废墟半个世纪之久，却曾是古老力量的聚集之地：先后有三个国家的旗帜飘扬于此，如今却都无影无踪了；曾有军队在这里苦苦奋战，但年代如此久远，如今连亡者尸骨都已腐烂；曾有无数战争亡魂被弃置于此，如今和平却将此地变成一座遗址。现在这位西点军校的毕业生滔滔不绝地讲解着每一个V型棱堡，每一面堡垒外崖，每一个弯角，每一处密道，把整个遗址看作由砖墙、泥浆和石块按一定规则建造而成的实体存在，与数学紧密相连，却毫无诗意可言。","In my first view of the ruins, I was favored with the scientific guidance of a young lieutenant of engineers, recently from West Point, where he had gained credit for great military genius.I saw nothing but confusion in what chiefly interested him; straight lines and zigzags, defence within defence, wall opposed to wall, and ditch intersecting ditch; oblong squares of masonry below the surface of the earth, and huge mounds, or turf-covered hills of stone, above it.On one of these artificial hillocks, a pine-tree has rooted itself, and grown tall and strong, since the banner-staff was levelled.But where my unmilitary glance could trace no regularity, the young lieutenant was perfectly at home.He fathomed the meaning of every ditch, and formed an entire plan of the fortress from its half-obliterated lines.His description of Ticonderoga would be as accurate as a geometrical theorem, and as barren of the poetry that has clustered round its decay.I viewed Ticonderoga as a place of ancient strength, in ruins for half a century: where the flags of three nations had successively waved, and none waved now; where armies had struggled, so long ago that the bones of the slain were mouldered; where Peace had found a heritage in the forsaken haunts of War.Now the young West-Pointer, with his lectures on ravelins, counterscarps, angles, and covered ways, made it an affair of brick and mortar and hewn stone, arranged on certain regular principles, having a good deal to do with mathematics, but nothing at all with poetry."
"如果是一位头发花白、步履蹒跚的老兵陪我游览，我会高兴得多。也许他会跟我讲些法国驻军和他们印度盟友——阿伯克龙比、豪爵士和阿默斯特——的故事，讲述伊桑·艾伦的胜利和圣克莱尔的投降。老兵和古要塞可以相互映衬、相得益彰。他对往事的追忆，尽管与泰孔德罗加要塞的湖中倒影一般清晰，却也和眼前景色的灰暗陈旧和谐一致，毫不突兀。当年驻守此地的军队早已遣散，作为一名幸存者，他虽然只是一名普通士兵，却或许能从世界各地召来阵亡的长官和战友们的灵魂——有些来自威斯敏斯特教堂，有些来自英格兰的教堂墓地和欧洲各处战场——有些则来自这里——美国的墓地，还有许多就长眠于古要塞附近的土地上。他也许能把他们全都召集起来，让他们列队通过已毁坏的大门，经过时还要将他们沧桑的脸庞朝向我。倘若能有这样一个游伴相陪，夫复何求。","I should have been glad of a hoary veteran to totter by my side, and tell me, perhaps, of the French garrisons and their Indian allies,—of Abercrombie, Lord Howe, and Amherst,—of Ethan Allen’s triumph and St. Clair’s surrender.The old soldier and the old fortress would be emblems of each other.His reminiscences, though vivid as the image of Ticonderoga in the lake, would harmonize with the gray influence of the scene.A survivor of the long-disbanded garrisons, though but a private soldier, might have mustered his dead chiefs and comrades,—some from Westminster Abbey, and English churchyards, and battle-fields in Europe,—others from their graves here in America,—others, not a few, who lie sleeping round the fortress; he might have mustered them all, and bid them march through the ruined gateway, turning their old historic faces on me, as they passed.Next to such a companion, the best is one’s own fancy."
"第二次游览时，我是独自一人。沿着要塞的防御土墙漫步一圈之后，我在一座已没有屋顶的营房里坐了下来，稍事休息。这些营房是古老的法国建筑，围绕着一块巨大空地的三面排开，如今已杂草丛生，荨麻和蓟草也随处可见。我停留的这间营房又长又窄，跟其他营房一样，有着尖尖的三角墙。营房外墙都还很完整，是由扁平的、未经挑选的灰色石块建造而成。虽年代久远，但仍坚不可摧，可抵挡风吹雨打，除非有强大的外力才能使其倒塌。——屋顶、地板、隔墙和其他木质构造大概都被火烧毁了，只有一些被火烧焦的古橡木条还嵌在窗台和门上。烟囱旁有几小片灰泥墙，上面被胡乱刷了几个人形，也许是出自哪个士兵之手。空旷的建筑内杂草丛生、繁茂浓密，遮住了散落各处的墙体碎片。野草长满了窗台和每一处石头缝隙后，还一点一点向屋顶蔓延，直到三角墙最高处也被它们占领，一束黄色野花在那里迎风跳舞。一些辛香的药草散发出阵阵芬芳，弥漫整个废墟。郁郁葱葱的植物长满了二楼壁炉前的地板，整根的木材曾在这里通红明亮的煤火中化为灰烬。在宽敞的烟管下面，植物长得尤为繁茂，过去它曾对着不少法国或英国士兵吐过浓烟。曾经燃烧木块的地方如今却成为荒草的温床，我感觉没有什么比这更能代表衰落和破败的了。","At another visit I was alone, and, after rambling all over the ramparts, sat down to rest myself in one of the roofless barracks.These are old French structures, and appear to have occupied three sides of a large area, now overgrown with grass, nettles, and thistles.The one in which I sat was long and narrow, as all the rest had been, with peaked gables.The exterior walls were nearly entire, constructed of gray, flat, unpicked stones, the aged strength of which promised long to resist the elements, if no other violence should precipitate their fall.—The roof, floors, partitions, and the rest of the wood-work had probably been burnt, except some bars of stanch old oak, which were blackened with fire, but still remained imbedded into the window-sills and over the doors.There were a few particles of plastering near the chimney, scratched with rude figures, perhaps by a soldier’s hand.A most luxuriant crop of weeds had sprung up within the edifice, and hid the scattered fragments of the wall.Grass and weeds grew in the windows, and in all the crevices of the stone, climbing, step by step, till a tuft of yellow flowers was waving on the highest peak of the gable.Some spicy herb diffused a pleasant odor through the ruin.A verdant heap of vegetation had covered the hearth of the second floor, clustering on the very spot where the huge logs had mouldered to glowing coals, and flourished beneath the broad flue, which had so often puffed the smoke over a circle of French or English soldiers.I felt that there was no other token of decay so impressive as that bed of weeds in the place of the backlog."
"我坐在这儿，四周是耸立的没有屋顶的高墙，头顶是清澈的天空，午后的阳光透过窗棱和门廊温柔又明亮地照射进来。我的耳畔是牛铃在叮当作响，小鸟在叽喳啁啾，昆虫发出欢快的嗡嗡声。一只色彩艳丽的蝴蝶轻盈地飞来，四扇翅膀上点缀着金色的斑点。它先是绕着我翩翩起舞，随后又向高出飞去，停靠在最高处的那束黄色野花上，最后飞向了湖对岸。接着，又有一只蜜蜂在阳光下嗡嗡地飞来，在野草丛中寻获了许多甘蜜。我目送蜜蜂飞向它远处的蜂巢，然后闭上双眼，不再凝视泰孔德罗加的废墟。我的目光梦游般地投向过去，投向在这里曾经上演过的一幕幕往事。","Here I sat, with those roofless walls about me, the clear sky over my head, and the afternoon sunshine falling gently bright through the window-frames and doorway.I heard the tinkling of a cow-bell, the twittering of birds, and the pleasant hum of insects.Once a gay butterfly, with four gold-speckled wings, came and fluttered about my head, then flew up and lighted on the highest tuft of yellow flowers, and at last took wing across the lake.Next a bee buzzed through the sunshine, and found much sweetness among the weeds.After watching him till he went off to his distant hive, I closed my eyes on Ticonderoga in ruins, and cast a dream-like glance over pictures of the past, and scenes of which this spot had been the theatre."
"起初，我的想象只能看见阴沉的山峦、孤独的湖泊和古色苍然的森林。自从种子撒落到这块原始的土地上后，就没有一棵树挨过斧子。它们在漫长的岁月中茁壮成长，变得枝繁叶茂，又在时间的重压之下慢慢衰老，逐渐弯曲倒下，最后埋葬于青苔之中，为其他树木的根系提供养分，使它们成长为参天大树。听！一支轻盈的木桨轻轻划过湖面，一条橡木做的独木舟从岬角荡出，一位印第安酋长从眼前经过。他脸饰油彩，头戴羽翎。他的装备有山胡桃木的弓、燧石头的箭，还有一把石头战斧。但湖面涟漪几乎还未消散时，就见微风中一面白旗在荒野里的一座城堡上空飘扬；城堡四周壁垒森严，还架着一百门大炮。城堡里站了一位法国骑士，他是要塞的指挥官，正向一位古铜色皮肤的姑娘献殷勤。这姑娘是当地的公主，而骑士正使尽浑身解数，想用那些博得过巴黎贵妇欢心的手段来赢得公主炽热的爱。一支由法国人和印第安人组成的作战编队正从大门出发，前去摧毁新英格兰的某个村庄。要塞附近还有一群人在跳舞。舞者是兴高采烈的士兵和皮肤黝黑的土著少女。树林深处，几个印第安人正围着一桶烈酒开怀畅饮，随着酒意渐浓而愈发狂乱。另一处，一位耶稣会士在树阴的华盖之下宣讲天主教高教派的信条，并向印第安人分发十字架，让他们在割下英国人头皮后戴上它。","At first, my fancy saw only the stern hills, lonely lakes, and venerable woods.Not a tree, since their seeds were first scattered over the infant soil, had felt the axe, but had grown up and flourished through its long generation, had fallen beneath the weight of years, been buried in green moss, and nourished the roots of others as gigantic.Hark!A light paddle dips into the lake, a birch canoe glides round the point, and an Indian chief has passed, painted and feather-crested, armed with a bow of hickory, a stone tomahawk, and flint-headed arrows.But the ripple had hardly vanished from the water, when a white flag caught the breeze, over a castle in the wilderness, with frowning ramparts and a hundred cannon.There stood a French chevalier, commandant of the fortress, paying court to a copper-colored lady, the princess of the land, and winning her wild love by the arts which had been successful with Parisian dames.A war-party of French and Indians were issuing from the gate to lay waste some village of New England.Near the fortress there was a group of dancers.The merry soldiers footing it with the swart savage maids; deeper in the wood, some red men were growing frantic around a keg of the fire-water; and elsewhere a Jesuit preached the faith of high cathedrals beneath a canopy of forest boughs, and distributed crucifixes to be worn beside English scalps."
"我试图从多年以前法国人的这场战争中想象出一系列的场景：当时湖面上一定战舰横飞，树林里也到处是奋战的士兵，尤其是阿贝尔克龙比的惨败，在那场战斗中有数千将士命丧于此。然而，因我对指挥作战一窍不通，只好选取杰弗里·阿默斯特爵士攻占要塞之后营房内的一个夜景。壁炉内炉火熊熊燃烧，火光映照在宝剑、刺刀和火枪管上，与色泽鲜红的军服交相辉映，直到整个营房都在微红的火光中闪烁！一位士兵也许是刚猎鹿归来，或者为摆脱印第安人的追踪刚刚奔跑了很久，一回来便倒头大睡。另外两个人站起来，推推搡搡，差点儿打起来。横笛手应和着鼓手吹奏出尖锐的曲调——一首诉说浪漫爱情与残暴战争的乐曲，还有20个人声如洪钟的合唱，歌声如雷。同时，角落里的一位老兵唠叨着德廷根和方特诺耶的故事，还有马尔伯勒战役的相关传闻，直到烟斗突然在他的鼻子底下爆炸，因为有人恶作剧地把火药放进去了。而如今他们全都已随着烟囱吐出的青烟消散了。","I tried to make a series of pictures from the old French war, when fleets were on the lake and armies in the woods, and especially of Abercrombie’s disastrous repulse, where thousands of lives were utterly thrown away; but, being at a loss how to order the battle, I chose an evening scene in the barracks, after the fortress had surrendered to Sir Jeffrey Amherst.What an immense fire blazes on that hearth, gleaming on swords, bayonets, and musket-barrels, and blending with the hue of the scarlet coats till the whole barrack-room is quivering with ruddy light!One soldier has thrown himself down to rest, after a deer-hunt, or perhaps a long run through the woods with Indians on his trail.Two stand up to wrestle, and are on the point of coming to blows.A fifer plays a shrill accompaniment to a drummer’s song,—a strain of light love and bloody war, with a chorus thundered forth by twenty voices.Meantime, a veteran in the corner is prosing about Dettingen and Fontenoy, and relates camp-traditions of Marlborough’s battles, till his pipe, having been roguishly charged with gunpowder, makes a terrible explosion under his nose.And now they all vanish in a puff of smoke from the chimney."
"随后的20年，我只不过匆匆瞥了几眼，那是一段和平的岁月，这边境要塞也是一片太平，直到伊桑·艾伦一声怒吼，命令要塞驻军“以耶和华和大陆会议之名”投降认输。真是奇怪的盟友！英国将领如是想。随之而来的是匆忙召集的为自由而战的将士们，伯戈因的大炮架在反抗山的山顶向下瞄准，宣布了泰孔德罗加的又一个占领者。从此，泰孔德罗加不再是未被侵占的要塞了！一群士兵从营房蜂拥而出，衣物装备五花八门：有人穿着联邦的蓝黄军服，有人穿着红色英国军服，有人穿着龙骑兵的短上衣，还有人穿着棉布长大衣；这儿有人穿一条皮革马裤，那儿又有条条纹裤子；一个戴着近卫步兵的帽子，另一个则戴着插了长羽毛的宽沿帽；有人拿了一把国王猎枪，子弹也许能射到克朗波因特那么远，而他的同伴则拿一把长猎枪，最多只能打打湖上的野鸭。就在这一片忙乱中，古堡的最后一个战争场面在我脑中栩栩如生上演时，湖上突然传来一阵铃声，使我突然睁开了眼，眼前只有这灰暗沉寂、杂草丛生的废墟。阳光下，这废墟如此寂静，宛如一座战士的孤坟。","I merely glanced at the ensuing twenty years, which glided peacefully over the frontier fortress, till Ethan Allen’s shout was heard, summoning it to surrender “in the name of the great Jehovah and of the Continental Congress.”Strange allies! thought the British captain.Next came the hurried muster of the soldiers of liberty, when the cannon of Burgoyne, pointing down upon their stronghold from the brow of Mount Defiance, announced a new conqueror of Ticonderoga.No virgin fortress, this!Forth rushed the motley throng from the barracks, one man wearing the blue and buff of the Union, another the red coat of Britain, a third a dragoon’s jacket, and a fourth a cotton frock; here was a pair of leather breeches, and striped trousers there; a grenadier’s cap on one head, and a broad-brimmed hat, with a tall feather, on the next; this fellow shouldering a king’s arm, that might throw a bullet to Crown Point, and his comrade a long fowling-piece, admirable to shoot ducks on the lake.In the midst of the bustle, when the fortress was all alive with its last warlike scene, the ringing of a bell on the lake made me suddenly unclose my eyes, and behold only the gray and weed-grown ruins.They were as peaceful in the sun as a warrior’s grave."
"我匆忙登上防御土墙，才发现铃声是从富兰克林号汽船上传来的；它在客栈停靠，以便让一位来自怀特霍尔的旅客上岸，随后又继续向北航行，以便第二天早上抵达加拿大。一艘单桅帆船也行驶在这一航线上，一艘小划艇刚从渡口经过，还有一艘装满木材的宽边帆船正展开巨大的方帆，沿湖驶去。整个地区是一片耕田的农场。在防御土墙的火枪射程之内还坐落着佩尔先生小巧整洁的别墅；佩尔先生自革命之后就成为了这处英美法三国长久争执之地的主人。时光荏苒，世事变迁，如今我才深刻体会其中深意！在泰孔德罗加的这座古要塞里，军旗不再飘扬，大炮不再咆哮，鲜血不再流淌，将士也不再因号角声而斗志昂扬。防御土墙之上已长出参天大树，最后一名驻军早已撤出，且一去不返，或者只有在梦的召唤下才会从昏黄的历史中悄然出现，又在现实中消失得无影无踪。","Hastening to the rampart, I perceived that the signal had been given by the steamboat Franklin, which landed a passenger from Whitehall at the tavern, and resumed its progress northward, to reach Canada the next morning.A sloop was pursuing the same track; a little skiff had just crossed the ferry; while a scow, laden with lumber, spread its huge square sail, and went up the lake.The whole country was a cultivated farm.Within musket-shot of the ramparts lay the neat villa of Mr. Pell, who, since the Revolution, has become proprietor of a spot for which France, England, and America have so often struggled.How forcibly the lapse of time and change of circumstances came home to my apprehension!Banner would never wave again, nor cannon roar, nor blood be shed, nor trumpet stir up a soldier’s heart, in this old fort of Ticonderoga.Tall trees have grown upon its ramparts, since the last garrison marched out, to return no more, or only at some dreamer’s summons, gliding from the twilight past to vanish among realities."
