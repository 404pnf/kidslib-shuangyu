"意外","The Unexpected"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","By Jack London"
"看到明显的东西，做意料之中的事情，都很容易。个人的生活总是趋于安定，而非动荡；文明的进程推动了这种趋势，在文明的社会里，人们看到的都是显而易见的事，意料之外的情况极少发生。不过，如果发生意外，而且情况足够重大，不能适应的人就会完蛋。他们看不到不明显的事物，无法应对意外的情况，不能改变原来的生活套路，去适应别的陌生生活方式。总之，他们原来的生活套路走到尽头的时候，他们就只有一死了之。","It is a simple matter to see the obvious, to do the expected.The tendency of the individual life is to be static rather than dynamic, and this tendency is made into a propulsion by civilization, where the obvious only is seen, and the unexpected rarely happens.When the unexpected does happen, however, and when it is of sufficiently grave import, the unfit perish.They do not see what is not obvious, are unable to do the unexpected, are incapable of adjusting their well-grooved lives to other and strange grooves.In short, when they come to the end of their own groove, they die."
"另一方面，也有能够生存下来的人，不管他们无心或被迫偏离到一条怎样奇怪的道路，他们都能摒弃原先明显、意料之中的规则，让自己适应新的生活。伊迪丝·惠特尔西就是这样的人。她出生在英格兰的农村，那里的生活墨守成规，超出常规之举会让人感到特别意外，以至于会被视作不道德。她很早就去帮佣，还是一个青年女子的时候，就按照惯例，成为一名贵妇的侍女。","On the other hand, there are those that make toward survival, the fit individuals who escape from the rule of the obvious and the expected and adjust their lives to no matter what strange grooves they may stray into, or into which they may be forced.Such an individual was Edith Whittlesey.She was born in a rural district of England, where life proceeds by rule of thumb and the unexpected is so very unexpected that when it happens it is looked upon as an immorality.She went into service early, and while yet a young woman, by rule-of-thumb progression, she became a lady’s maid."
"文明的影响就在于强迫环境遵循人类的律法，直到环境变得跟机器一样规规整整。不会出现麻烦的事，一定要发生的事都会预料得到。一个人可能连雨都淋不着，也不会给风霜冻伤。就是死亡，也不是一直在身边徘徊，显得那么可怕和偶然，而是像一场预先编排好的大戏，顺顺当当地一直演到棺木送进家族墓穴；不但墓门上的合页保养得很好，不会生锈，连空气中的灰尘也会得到不断清扫。","The effect of civilization is to impose human law upon environment until it becomes machine-like in its regularity.The objectionable is eliminated, the inevitable is foreseen.One is not even made wet by the rain nor cold by the frost; while death, instead of stalking about grewsome and accidental, becomes a prearranged pageant, moving along a well-oiled groove to the family vault, where the hinges are kept from rusting and the dust from the air is swept continually away."
"伊迪丝·惠特尔西面临的环境就是如此。根本没发生过什么事。她二十五岁的时候，陪着女主人去美国旅游了一趟，不过这几乎说不上是一件事。不过是生活的辙印换了个方向。还是同样的顺顺当当、按部就班的生活。这段横跨大西洋的旅程毫无变故。船几乎就不是一条航行在大海之中的船，而是一座宽广的布满走廊的旅馆，迅速而平稳地移动着，用庞大的身躯将海浪压得服服帖帖；大海几乎变成磨坊边的池塘，单调而安静。到了另一端的岸上，这样设定的旅程还在继续——一路都安排得妥帖而上档次，每次停留的地方都有旅馆，两次停留的地方之间还有装在轮子上的旅馆。","Such was the environment of Edith Whittlesey.Nothing happened.It could scarcely be called a happening, when, at the age of twenty-five, she accompanied her mistress on a bit of travel to the United States.The groove merely changed its direction.It was still the same groove and well oiled.It was a groove that bridged the Atlantic with uneventfulness, so that the ship was not a ship in the midst of the sea, but a capacious, many-corridored hotel that moved swiftly and placidly, crushing the waves into submission with its colossal bulk until the sea was a mill-pond, monotonous with quietude.And at the other side the groove continued on over the land—a well-disposed, respectable groove that supplied hotels at every stopping-place, and hotels on wheels between the stopping-places."
"到了芝加哥，她的女主人看到了社交生活的一面，而伊迪丝·惠特尔西看到了另一面。到她辞别女主人，不再做侍女，而成为伊迪丝·纳尔逊的时候，她才略微显露了一把她的能力：她不仅能解决意外，而且能掌控意外。汉斯·纳尔逊是个移民，原籍瑞典，职业是木匠。他身上有着日耳曼人不屈不挠的精神，正是这种精神驱动着这个民族进行伟大的西进冒险。他是一个肌肉发达、头脑迟钝的人，极少幻想，却有着极强的进取欲望；他的忠诚和爱意，跟他的体格一样坚实可靠。","In Chicago, while her mistress saw one side of social life, Edith Whittlesey saw another side; and when she left her lady’s service and became Edith Nelson, she betrayed, perhaps faintly, her ability to grapple with the unexpected and to master it.Hans Nelson, immigrant, Swede by birth and carpenter by occupation, had in him that Teutonic unrest that drives the race ever westward on its great adventure.He was a large-muscled, stolid sort of a man, in whom little imagination was coupled with immense initiative, and who possessed, withal, loyalty and affection as sturdy as his own strength."
"“等我好好干一段时间，攒下些钱来，我就去科罗拉多。”新婚第二天，他对伊迪丝说。一年之后，他们真的去了科罗拉多。汉斯·纳尔逊在那儿第一次见到了采矿，就狂热地迷上了采矿。他四处勘探，走过了南北达科他、爱达荷、俄勒冈东部，还深入英属哥伦比亚的群山之间。不管是露营还是行进，伊迪丝·纳尔逊跟他一路同甘共苦，辛苦的活儿也帮他分担。她当大门不迈的侍女时的那种小碎步，已经变成了翻山越岭时的大步流星。她学会了用冷静的目光和清醒的头脑来对待危险，再也不会吓得手足无措了；那种恐惧源于无知，深深困扰着城里长大的人们，使他们像蠢马一样，一受惊吓就动弹不得、听天由命，而不去奋力搏斗，或者就盲目奔逃、自相践踏，堆积的尸体把逃命的路都堵死了。","“When I have worked hard and saved me some money, I will go to Colorado,” he had told Edith on the day after their wedding.A year later they were in Colorado, where Hans Nelson saw his first mining and caught the mining-fever himself.His prospecting led him through the Dakotas, Idaho, and eastern Oregon, and on into the mountains of British Columbia.In camp and on trail, Edith Nelson was always with him, sharing his luck, his hardship, and his toil.The short step of the house-reared woman she exchanged for the long stride of the mountaineer.She learned to look upon danger clear-eyed and with understanding, losing forever that panic fear which is bred of ignorance and which afflicts the city-reared, making them as silly as silly horses, so that they await fate in frozen horror instead of grappling with it, or stampede in blind self-destroying terror which clutters the way with their crushed carcasses."
"一路前行，处处都有意外，伊迪丝·纳尔逊把眼光也锻炼出来了，她放眼一望，看到的不是明显的东西，而是隐藏的东西。她平生从没煮过饭菜，却学会了不用啤酒花、酵母或者发面粉就做出面包来，学会了在篝火上用煎锅烤面包。当最后一杯面粉和最后一块腌肉也吃光了的时候，她能够随机应变，把鹿皮软鞋和行李上鞣制得比较软的皮做成替代食物，让她的丈夫能够多少保住性命，勉强前行。她学会了套马，套得跟男人一样好——这个活儿要是让任何一个城里人来干，脸面和胆量都会丢尽；她还知道那种行李最好用那种方法捆扎。她还可以在倾盆大雨中拿湿木头生火而不气馁。总之，在各种恶劣环境里，她都成功掌控了意外。但是，她生命中最大的意外还没有到来，还没有开始考验她。","Edith Nelson met the unexpected at every turn of the trail, and she trained her vision so that she saw in the landscape, not the obvious, but the concealed.She, who had never cooked in her life, learned to make bread without the mediation of hops, yeast, or baking-powder, and to bake bread, top and bottom, in a frying-pan before an open fire.And when the last cup of flour was gone and the last rind of bacon, she was able to rise to the occasion, and of moccasins and the softer-tanned bits of leather in the outfit to make a grub-stake substitute that somehow held a man’s soul in his body and enabled him to stagger on.She learned to pack a horse as well as a man,—a task to break the heart and the pride of any city-dweller, and she knew how to throw the hitch best suited for any particular kind of pack.Also, she could build a fire of wet wood in a downpour of rain and not lose her temper.In short, in all its guises she mastered the unexpected.But the Great Unexpected was yet to come into her life and put its test upon her."
"这时，寻找金矿的浪潮向北涌入了阿拉斯加，汉斯·纳尔逊和他的妻子也不可避免地卷了进来，一路奔向克朗代克。１８９７年秋天，他们到了戴亚，却没有钱将行李运过契尔库特山隘，再放舟前往道森。这年冬天，汉斯·纳尔逊就干起了老本行。斯卡圭，这个一夜之间冒出来的供给行李用品的小镇，汉斯对它的发展也出了一份力。","The gold-seeking tide was flooding northward into Alaska, and it was inevitable that Hans Nelson and his wife should he caught up by the stream and swept toward the Klondike.The fall of 1897 found them at Dyea, but without the money to carry an outfit across Chilcoot Pass and float it down to Dawson.So Hans Nelson worked at his trade that winter and helped rear the mushroom outfitting-town of Skaguay."
"他已经到了黄金国的边缘，这一冬天，他都觉得整个阿拉斯加都在召唤他。拉图亚湾对他吸引力最大，于是，１８９８年夏天，他和妻子坐上七十英尺长的印第安独木舟，沿着迷宫般的破碎海岸线摸索前进。跟他们同行的有印第安人和三个白人男子。印第安人把他们的人和给养送到离拉图亚湾约有一百英里的一个偏僻地方，就返回斯卡圭去了；三个白人男子留下了，因为他们跟纳尔逊夫妇结成了一个小集团。行李设备所用的钱大家均摊，以后赚的钱也会平分。伊迪丝·纳尔逊就为这些人烧饭，将来她也可以得到一份好处。","He was on the edge of things, and throughout the winter he heard all Alaska calling to him.Latuya Bay called loudest, so that the summer of 1898 found him and his wife threading the mazes of the broken coast-line in seventy-foot Siwash canoes.With them were Indians, also three other men.The Indians landed them and their supplies in a lonely bight of land a hundred miles or so beyond Latuya Bay, and returned to Skaguay; but the three other men remained, for they were members of the organized party.Each had put an equal share of capital into the outfitting, and the profits were to he divided equally.In that Edith Nelson undertook to cook for the outfit, a man’s share was to be her portion."
"首先，他们砍到了许多云杉，建起了一幢有三间屋子的小房子。打理家务成了伊迪丝·纳尔逊的任务。男人们的任务则是寻找金矿，而且要找到，他们也办到了。这倒不是什么惊人的大发现，因为只是一处储量很低的冲积矿，辛辛苦苦干上很长时间，一个人每天也只能得到十五到二十美元的金砂。这一年，阿拉斯加短暂的夏天比往年拖长了不少，他们就抓住这个机会，尽量推迟回斯卡圭的时间。结果，一切都太晚了。他们本来跟当地的几十个印第安人约好，等印第安人秋天去做生意的时候，一起南下海岸。印第安人等着这些白人等到最后一刻，终于开船走了。这伙人除了等偶然的机会搭个船之外，已经没有别的路可走了。这段日子里，他们淘光了金矿，贮存了许多木柴。","First, spruce trees were cut down and a three-room cabin constructed.To keep this cabin was Edith Nelson’s task.The task of the men was to search for gold, which they did; and to find gold, which they likewise did.It was not a startling find, merely a low-pay placer where long hours of severe toil earned each man between fifteen and twenty dollars a day.The brief Alaskan summer protracted itself beyond its usual length, and they took advantage of the opportunity, delaying their return to Skaguay to the last moment.And then it was too late.Arrangements had been made to accompany the several dozen local Indians on their fall trading trip down the coast.The Siwashes had waited on the white people until the eleventh hour, and then departed.There was no course left the party but to wait for chance transportation.In the meantime the claim was cleaned up and firewood stocked in."
"温暖的深秋像梦一样持续了好长时间，突然之间，冬天就带着尖利的呼号到来了。一夜之间冬天就来了，几个淘金者一觉醒来，已经是狂风大作、大雪纷飞、千里冰封。暴风雪一次又一次地刮起，中间间歇的时候，天地之间静悄悄的，只有澎湃的浪花拍打在荒凉的海岸上，打破这一沉寂，浓霜似的盐沫给沙滩镶上了一道白边。","The Indian summer had dreamed on and on, and then, suddenly, with the sharpness of bugles, winter came.It came in a single night, and the miners awoke to howling wind, driving snow, and freezing water.Storm followed storm, and between the storms there was the silence, broken only by the boom of the surf on the desolate shore, where the salt spray rimmed the beach with frozen white."
"房子里则是一切如意。金砂都称过了，约有八千美元，他们没法不感到心满意足。男人们都做了雪鞋，出去打一次猎就能带回好多新鲜肉储藏起来；漫漫长夜里，他们就一直玩牌，有时候打惠斯特，有时候打彼得牌。既然采矿已经结束，伊迪丝·纳尔逊就把生火和洗盘子的工作交给男人们去干，而她则为他们补袜子、缝衣服。","All went well in the cabin.Their gold-dust had weighed up something like eight thousand dollars, and they could not but be contented.The men made snowshoes, hunted fresh meat for the larder, and in the long evenings played endless games of whist and pedro.Now that the mining had ceased, Edith Nelson turned over the fire-building and the dish-washing to the men, while she darned their socks and mended their clothes."
"这幢小房子里从来没有抱怨、争吵，也没有发生过琐碎的拌嘴；这伙人的运气还不错，所以他们常常彼此祝贺。汉斯·纳尔逊头脑迟钝，待人随和，而伊迪丝早就凭借她待人接物的本事赢得了他无限的钦佩。哈基是个高大而干瘦的德克萨斯人，虽然性情忧郁，沉默寡言，但对人非常友善；只要他那套金子会生长的论调没人跳出来反对，他就是一个非常好相处的人。这个小集团的第四个成员叫迈克尔·丹宁，他给小房子里欢愉的气氛中增添了爱尔兰式的睿智。他是一个魁梧有力的人，容易为一些小事突然发火，可是每逢大事，局面紧张的时候，他又总能保持不错的心境。第五个，也是最后一个成员，叫做达基，自愿充当这个小集团的开心果。为了大家高兴，他甚至不惜自己出丑来制造笑料。他活着的目的似乎就是惹人发笑。在他们平静的生活中，从来没有发生过严重的争吵。既然干了短短一夏天，每人就收获了一千六百美元，小房子笼罩在一片富足、满意的氛围当中。","There was no grumbling, no bickering, nor petty quarrelling in the little cabin, and they often congratulated one another on the general happiness of the party.Hans Nelson was stolid and easy-going, while Edith had long before won his unbounded admiration by her capacity for getting on with people.Harkey, a long, lank Texan, was unusually friendly for one with a saturnine disposition, and, as long as his theory that gold grew was not challenged, was quite companionable.The fourth member of the party, Michael Dennin, contributed his Irish wit to the gayety of the cabin.He was a large, powerful man, prone to sudden rushes of anger over little things, and of unfailing good-humor under the stress and strain of big things.The fifth and last member, Dutchy, was the willing butt of the party.He even went out of his way to raise a laugh at his own expense in order to keep things cheerful.His deliberate aim in life seemed to be that of a maker of laughter.No serious quarrel had ever vexed the serenity of the party; and, now that each had sixteen hundred dollars to show for a short summer’s work, there reigned the well-fed, contented spirit of prosperity."
"接着，意外就发生了。他们刚坐在桌边准备吃早饭。尽管已经八点钟了（淘金的活儿停止以后，早餐自然也就吃得晚些了），还是得点燃那支插在瓶口的蜡烛来照亮饭桌。伊迪丝和汉斯分坐在桌子的两头。哈基和达基背靠着门，坐在桌子的一边。他们对面还空着一个位子。丹宁还没有来。","And then the unexpected happened.They had just sat down to the breakfast table.Though it was already eight o’clock (late breakfasts had followed naturally upon cessation of the steady work at mining) a candle in the neck of a bottle lighted the meal.Edith and Hans sat at each end of the table.On one side, with their backs to the door, sat Harkey and Dutchy.The place on the other side was vacant.Dennin had not yet come in."
"汉斯·纳尔逊看了一眼那把空椅子，缓缓地摇摇头，想要幽默一把，却说不好：“平常说到吃，他跑得最快了。真奇怪。可能他病了吧？”","Hans Nelson looked at the empty chair, shook his head slowly, and, with a ponderous attempt at humor, said: “Always is he first at the grub.It is very strange.Maybe he is sick.”"
"“迈克尔去哪儿了？”伊迪丝问道。","“Where is Michael?”Edith asked."
"“他起得比我们早一点，出去了。”哈基回答道。","“Got up a little ahead of us and went outside,” Harkey answered."
"达基的脸上露出淘气的笑容。他假装知道丹宁为什么没来，摆出一副神神秘秘的表情，结果大家都吵着向他打听。伊迪丝往男人们的寝室里望了一眼，回到桌子前来。汉斯看了看她，她则摇了摇头。","Dutchy’s face beamed mischievously.He pretended knowledge of Dennin’s absence, and affected a mysterious air, while they clamored for information.Edith, after a peep into the men’s bunk-room, returned to the table.Hans looked at her, and she shook her head."
"“他以前从来不会误饭点的。”她说。","“He was never late at meal-time before,” she remarked."
"“我想不明白，”汉斯说，“他的胃口一贯大得像马。”","“I cannot understand,” said Hans.“Always has he the great appetite like the horse.”"
"“太糟啦。”达基伤心地摇着头说道。","“It is too bad,” Dutchy said, with a sad shake of his head."
"有个伙伴没来，他们却借此大开玩笑。","They were beginning to make merry over their comrade’s absence."
"“实在是太可怜了！”达基主动挑起话题来。","“It is a great pity!”Dutchy volunteered."
"“怎么了？”其他人异口同声地问他。","“What?” they demanded in chorus."
"“可怜的迈克尔啊，”他的回答充满惋惜的味道。","“Poor Michael,” was the mournful reply."
"“哎，迈克尔怎么啦？”哈基问道。","“Well, what’s wrong with Michael?”Harkey asked."
"“他不会再觉得饿了，”达基惨兮兮地说，“他把胃口丢了。他不喜欢吃的了。”","“He is not hungry no more,” wailed Dutchy.“He has lost der appetite.He do not like der grub.”"
"“怎么会，他吃起东西来耳朵都快埋进去了。”哈基说。","“Not from the way he pitches into it up to his ears,” remarked Harkey."
"“他这样做，是对纳尔逊太太表示礼貌，”达基马上反驳到，“我知道的，我知道的，太糟了。他为啥不在这儿呢？因为他出去了。为啥要出去呢？出去开开胃。他怎么开胃呢？光脚在雪地上走。噢！我还会不知道？有钱人要是没胃口了，胃口跑了，这就是他们找回胃口的办法。迈克尔有一千六百块的金砂。他是有钱人。他就没胃口了。所以呢，于是乎，他就得把胃口追回来。你们要是打开门，就能看见他光着脚在雪地上走呢。不过你们看不见他的胃口。这正是困扰他的地方。他要是见着了胃口，就抓回来吃早饭了。”","“He does dot shust to be politeful to Mrs. Nelson,” was Dutchy’s quick retort.“I know, I know, and it is too pad.Why is he not here?Pecause he haf gone out.Why haf he gone out?For der defelopment of der appetite.How does he defelop der appetite?He walks barefoots in der snow.Ach! don’t I know?It is der way der rich peoples chases after der appetite when it is no more and is running away.Michael haf sixteen hundred dollars.He is rich peoples.He haf no appetite.Derefore, pecause, he is chasing der appetite.Shust you open der door und you will see his barefoots in der snow.No, you will not see der appetite.Dot is shust his trouble.When he sees der appetite he will catch it und come to preak-fast.”"
"达基的胡言乱语惹得大家哈哈大笑。笑声还没停，门就打开了，丹宁走了进来。大家都转过头去看他。他手里拿着一杆猎枪。就在他们看着的时候，丹宁把枪举上肩头，连开两枪。第一枪打中了达基，他一下子倒在桌子上，撞翻了咖啡杯，他那丛乱蓬蓬的黄头发浸到那盘粥里去了。他的额头压在盘子边缘，使盘子翘了起来，跟桌面形成一个四十五度的角。哈基当时已经跳了起来，在空中被第二枪击中；他脸朝下栽倒在地板上，那声“天哪”只是在喉咙里哼了一声，还没来得及喊出来。","They burst into loud laughter at Dutchy’s nonsense.The sound had scarcely died away when the door opened and Dennin came in.All turned to look at him.He was carrying a shot-gun.Even as they looked, he lifted it to his shoulder and fired twice.At the first shot Dutchy sank upon the table, overturning his mug of coffee, his yellow mop of hair dabbling in his plate of mush.His forehead, which pressed upon the near edge of the plate, tilted the plate up against his hair at an angle of forty-five degrees.Harkey was in the air, in his spring to his feet, at the second shot, and he pitched face down upon the floor, his “My God!” gurgling and dying in his throat."
"真是太出乎意料了。汉斯和伊迪丝都惊呆了。他们浑身紧张地坐在桌子旁边，眼睛像着了魔一样紧紧盯着这个杀人凶手。从火药的烟雾中，他们隐隐约约地看见了他；屋里一片寂静，只能听见达基那杯打翻的咖啡嗒嗒地滴到地板上的声音。丹宁打开猎枪后膛，退出两枚空弹壳。他一手端着枪，一手伸进口袋去摸子弹。","It was the unexpected.Hans and Edith were stunned.They sat at the table with bodies tense, their eyes fixed in a fascinated gaze upon the murderer.Dimly they saw him through the smoke of the powder, and in the silence nothing was to be heard save the drip-drip of Dutchy’s spilled coffee on the floor.Dennin threw open the breech of the shot-gun, ejecting the empty shells.Holding the gun with one hand, he reached with the other into his pocket for fresh shells."
"他正要将子弹装进猎枪，伊迪丝·纳尔逊警醒过来，准备采取行动。很明显，他还想杀了汉斯和她。这件意外来得太可怕、太难以置信了，使得她在大约三秒钟的时间里都神志恍惚、手脚僵硬。接着，她就挺身而出，跟这个意外斗一斗。她的行动非常实际：像猫一样纵身跃到凶手面前，双手揪住了他的衣领。这一撞让他踉踉跄跄地倒退了好几步。他试图摆脱她，又紧抓着猎枪不放。这可不好办，因为伊迪丝结实的身体已经像猫一样灵便。她扭住他的脖子，狠命往旁边一倒，这下差点把他摔倒在地板上。他站直身子，飞快地旋转起来。她还是抓得很紧，身体就随着他的旋转而转动起来，她的脚都离开了地板；她更加使劲地抓住他的脖子，悬空转了起来。他们这样转着，直到她撞到了一把椅子；两人在死命打斗之下狠狠地摔倒在地，占据了半个房间的面积。","He was thrusting the shells into the gun when Edith Nelson was aroused to action.It was patent that he intended to kill Hans and her.For a space of possibly three seconds of time she had been dazed and paralysed by the horrible and inconceivable form in which the unexpected had made its appearance.Then she rose to it and grappled with it.She grappled with it concretely, making a cat-like leap for the murderer and gripping his neck-cloth with both her hands.The impact of her body sent him stumbling backward several steps.He tried to shake her loose and still retain his hold on the gun.This was awkward, for her firm-fleshed body had become a cat’s.She threw herself to one side, and with her grip at his throat nearly jerked him to the floor.He straightened himself and whirled swiftly.Still faithful to her hold, her body followed the circle of his whirl so that her feet left the floor, and she swung through the air fastened to his throat by her hands.The whirl culminated in a collision with a chair, and the man and woman crashed to the floor in a wild struggling fall that extended itself across half the length of the room."
"在应付这件意外情况上，汉斯·纳尔逊比他妻子慢了半秒钟。他的神经和头脑的处理速度都比她要慢。他是那种心眼儿比较粗的人，要多耗费半秒钟才能认清情况、拿定主意并开始行动。汉斯跳起来的时候，伊迪丝已经飞扑到丹宁身上，掐住了他的脖子。汉斯可没有她那样的冷静。他怒火中烧，是那种失去理智的狂怒。他一从椅子上跳起来，就张着嘴发出一半像狮吼，一半像牛叫的声音。丹宁和伊迪丝的身体已经开始转起来了，他还在吼叫，然后就在房子里追赶着旋转着的两人，直到两人摔在地上，他才追到。","Hans Nelson was half a second behind his wife in rising to the unexpected.His nerve processed and mental processes were slower than hers.His was the grosser organism, and it had taken him half a second longer to perceive, and determine, and proceed to do.She had already flown at Dennin and gripped his throat, when Hans sprang to his feet.But her coolness was not his.He was in a blind fury, a Berserker rage.At the instant he sprang from his chair his mouth opened and there issued forth a sound that was half roar, half bellow.The whirl of the two bodies had already started, and still roaring, or bellowing, he pursued this whirl down the room, overtaking it when it fell to the floor."
"汉斯一扑到那个跌倒的男人身上，就疯了似地用拳头打他。这些拳头打下去，像大锤一样，等到伊迪丝觉得丹宁松懈了，她才松开手，翻滚到一边去。她躺在地板上，一边喘气，一边看着。愤怒的拳头还在雨点般地砸下去。丹宁好像都不在乎挨这些拳头。他动都没有动一下。她才猛然觉得丹宁已经人事不省了。她急忙大喊汉斯住手。她又喊了一遍。但是汉斯没有理会她的喊声。她抓住他的胳膊，不过这样没能阻止他，只是使他挥起拳头来不大方便罢了。","Hans hurled himself upon the prostrate man, striking madly with his fists.They were sledge-like blows, and when Edith felt Dennin’s body relax she loosed her grip and rolled clear.She lay on the floor, panting and watching.The fury of blows continued to rain down.Dennin did not seem to mind the blows.He did not even move.Then it dawned upon her that he was unconscious.She cried out to Hans to stop.She cried out again.But he paid no heed to her voice.She caught him by the arm, but her clinging to it merely impeded his effort."
"她做出下面的这个举动，是出于一种无法解释的冲动。这样做并不是出于怜悯，也不是要服从宗教的“不可为”的戒律。这是源于一种守法的意识，一种从种族继承而来、自童年时期就培养起来的道德感；因为这样，她不由自主地将自己的身体横在丈夫和那个已经无法反抗的凶手之间。直到发觉自己打的是自己的妻子时，汉斯才停手。他听任伊迪丝把自己推开，像极了一条凶猛但听话的狗，乖乖地任由主人把自己赶开。这个比喻还可以更像一些。汉斯的喉管里还回响着野兽般的愤怒的低嚎，有好几次他都想扑到猎物身上，都被他的妻子迅速地用身体挡住了。","It was no reasoned impulse that stirred her to do what she then did.Nor was it a sense of pity, nor obedience to the “Thou shalt not” of religion.Rather was it some sense of law, an ethic of her race and early environment, that compelled her to interpose her body between her husband and the helpless murderer.It was not until Hans knew he was striking his wife that he ceased.He allowed himself to be shoved away by her in much the same way that a ferocious but obedient dog allows itself to be shoved away by its master.The analogy went even farther.Deep in his throat, in an animal-like way, Hans’s rage still rumbled, and several times he made as though to spring back upon his prey and was only prevented by the woman’s swiftly interposed body."
"伊迪丝把他的丈夫一步一步往后推。她从没见过丈夫露出这副模样；丈夫这个样子，比跟她打斗最激烈时的丹宁，更让她感到害怕。她简直不敢相信，这头狂怒的野兽就是她的丈夫汉斯；她浑身一抖，忽然有种很畏缩的感觉，本能地害怕他会像一头发狂的野兽一样，扑过来用牙咬她的手。虽然不想伤害她，汉斯却不肯罢休，还是想回来接着打人；好些时候，他总是时而后退，时而前进。但是她坚决地拦住了他，直到他恢复理智，平静下来。","Back and farther back Edith shoved her husband.She had never seen him in such a condition, and she was more frightened of him than she had been of Dennin in the thick of the struggle.She could not believe that this raging beast was her Hans, and with a shock she became suddenly aware of a shrinking, instinctive fear that he might snap her hand in his teeth like any wild animal.For some seconds, unwilling to hurt her, yet dogged in his desire to return to the attack, Hans dodged back and forth.But she resolutely dodged with him, until the first glimmerings of reason returned and he gave over."
"两人都费劲地站了起来。汉斯摇摇晃晃地靠回墙边，他脸上的肉还在抽动，喉管里还在发出低沉的嘶吼；这声音慢慢变小，几秒钟之后终于听不见了。他终于反应过来了。伊迪丝站在地板中间，拧着双手，气喘吁吁，浑身剧烈地颤抖着。","Both crawled to their feet.Hans staggered back against the wall, where he leaned, his face working, in his throat the deep and continuous rumble that died away with the seconds and at last ceased.The time for the reaction had come.Edith stood in the middle of the floor, wringing her hands, panting and gasping, her whole body trembling violently."
"汉斯什么也没看，伊迪丝的眼睛则在疯狂地扫视着这间屋子，仔细查看刚才都发生了什么。丹宁一动不动地躺着。在疯狂旋转之中撞翻的椅子就在他旁边。那支猎枪有一截被他压在身下，后膛仍然是打开的。两枚没来得及装进枪膛的子弹从他右手里滚出来，他本来紧紧捏着，失去知觉了才松开手。哈基脸朝下，扑在他摔下去的地方；达基则往前伏在桌子上，蓬乱的黄头发浸在那盘玉米粥里。盘子仍然翘着，跟桌面形成一个四十五度角。她被这个翘起来的盘子吸引住了。为什么盘子不倒呢？太奇怪了。人都死了，盛粥的盘子还能翘在桌子上，实在不合情理。","Hans looked at nothing, but Edith’s eyes wandered wildly from detail to detail of what had taken place.Dennin lay without movement.The overturned chair, hurled onward in the mad whirl, lay near him.Partly under him lay the shot-gun, still broken open at the breech.Spilling out of his right hand were the two cartridges which he had failed to put into the gun and which he had clutched until consciousness left him.Harkey lay on the floor, face downward, where he had fallen; while Dutchy rested forward on the table, his yellow mop of hair buried in his mush-plate, the plate itself still tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees.This tilted plate fascinated her.Why did it not fall down?It was ridiculous.It was not in the nature of things for a mush-plate to up-end itself on the table, even if a man or so had been killed."
"她瞟了一眼丹宁，不过又马上转回来看这个翘起的盘子。太奇怪了！她有一种想歇斯底里大笑的冲动。接着，她注意到屋里很安静，就期待发生点什么，把那个盘子忘掉了。咖啡从桌子上滴到地板上的单调声音只是让屋里显得更加安静了。为什么汉斯不做点什么？不说点什么呢？她看着汉斯，刚想说点什么，猛地发现舌头已经不听使唤了。她的喉咙里有一种很特别的疼痛感，嘴巴又干又苦。她只能看着汉斯，而汉斯也看着她。","She glanced back at Dennin, but her eyes returned to the tilted plate.It was so ridiculous!She felt a hysterical impulse to laugh.Then she noticed the silence, and forgot the plate in a desire for something to happen.The monotonous drip of the coffee from the table to the floor merely emphasized the silence.Why did not Hans do something? say something?She looked at him and was about to speak, when she discovered that her tongue refused its wonted duty.There was a peculiar ache in her throat, and her mouth was dry and furry.She could only look at Hans, who, in turn, looked at her."
"突然，一声尖利的金属的哐啷声打破了这种沉寂。她尖叫一声，赶忙去瞧那张桌子。盘子已经掉下去了。汉斯叹息一声，好像大梦初醒。盘子哐啷一声落地，将他们唤回了这个他们将要生活在其中的新世界。他们以后要生活和行动的新世界，就浓缩在这幢小房子里了。原来的房子里那种生活已经一去不复返了。全新的生活看上去那么陌生。这场意外在一切事物的表面施了一层魔法，改变了事物的前景，模糊了价值，混淆了现实与非现实，呈现出一片令人无所适从的混乱景象。","Suddenly the silence was broken by a sharp, metallic clang.She screamed, jerking her eyes back to the table.The plate had fallen down.Hans sighed as though awakening from sleep.The clang of the plate had aroused them to life in a new world.The cabin epitomized the new world in which they must thenceforth live and move.The old cabin was gone forever.The horizon of life was totally new and unfamiliar.The unexpected had swept its wizardry over the face of things, changing the perspective, juggling values, and shuffling the real and the unreal into perplexing confusion."
"“天哪，汉斯！”伊迪丝说出了第一句话。","“My God, Hans!” was Edith’s first speech."
"汉斯没有回答，只是一脸惊恐地盯着她。他慢慢地扫视了一遍这个屋子，这才算看清楚了。然后，他戴上帽子，朝门口走去。","He did not answer, but stared at her with horror.Slowly his eyes wandered over the room, for the first time taking in its details.Then he put on his cap and started for the door."
"“你要去哪儿？”伊迪丝极其担心地追问道。","“Where are you going?”Edith demanded, in an agony of apprehension."
"他的手已经握在了门把手上，他半转过身子，答道：“去挖几座坟。”","His hand was on the door-knob, and he half turned as he answered, “To dig some graves.”"
"“别丢下我，汉斯，跟——跟这些在一起。”她的眼睛扫视着屋内。","“Don’t leave me, Hans, with—”her eyes swept the room—“with this.”"
"“坟早晚都是要挖的。”他说。","“The graves must be dug sometime,” he said."
"“但是你不知道要挖几个。”她绝望地反驳到。她注意到他有点犹豫不决，所以又说了一句：“而且，我跟你去，还能帮上点忙。”","“But you do not know how many,” she objected desperately.She noted his indecision, and added, “Besides, I’ll go with you and help.”"
"汉斯折回桌边，机械地吹灭了蜡烛。接着，他们两人开始查看屋里的情形。哈基和达基两人都死了，死状恐怖，因为开枪的距离太近了。汉斯不愿走近丹宁，伊迪丝不得已，就自己前去查看。","Hans stepped back to the table and mechanically snuffed the candle.Then between them they made the examination.Both Harkey and Dutchy were dead—frightfully dead, because of the close range of the shot-gun.Hans refused to go near Dennin, and Edith was forced to conduct this portion of the investigation by herself."
"“他还没死。”她叫汉斯说。","“He isn’t dead,” she called to Hans."
"汉斯走过来，低头看着这个杀人凶手。","He walked over and looked down at the murderer."
"“你在说什么？”伊迪丝听见丈夫的喉咙里含混地咕哝着什么，就问道。","“What did you say?”Edith demanded, having caught the rumble of inarticulate speech in her husband’s throat."
"“我说，没把他揍死，真是丢人。”这就是回答。","“I said it was a damn shame that he isn’t dead,” came the reply."
"伊迪丝弯下腰去检查丹宁。","Edith was bending over the body."
"“你躲开。”汉斯粗暴地命令道，声音很奇怪。","“Leave him alone,” Hans commanded harshly, in a strange voice."
"她突然警觉起来，看了他一眼。他拾起了丹宁丢下的猎枪，正在装填子弹。","She looked at him in sudden alarm.He had picked up the shot-gun dropped by Dennin and was thrusting in the shells."
"“你要干什么？”她大叫起来，很快直起身来。","“What are you going to do?” she cried, rising swiftly from her bending position."
"汉斯没有回答，伊迪丝只看见猎枪被举上了肩头。她抓住枪口，把枪抬高。","Hans did not answer, but she saw the shot-gun going to his shoulder.She grasped the muzzle with her hand and threw it up."
"“别管我！”他嘶哑地吼道。","“Leave me alone!” he cried hoarsely."
"他试图把枪夺过来，但是她靠得更近了，紧紧地抱住了他。","He tried to jerk the weapon away from her, but she came in closer and clung to him."
"“汉斯！汉斯！醒醒！”她大叫着，“别发疯！”","“Hans!Hans!Wake up!” she cried.“Don’t be crazy!”"
"“他杀了达基和哈基！”她的丈夫答到，“我要杀了他。”","“He killed Dutchy and Harkey!” was her husband’s reply; “and I am going to kill him.”"
"“这样做不对，”她反对说，“还有法律呢。”","“But that is wrong,” she objected.“There is the law.”"
"他冷笑一声，因为他不相信在这种地方法律还能管用；他只是毫无感情地、执拗地重复着：“他杀了达基和哈基。”","He sneered his incredulity of the law’s potency in such a region, but he merely iterated, dispassionately, doggedly, “He killed Dutchy and Harkey.”"
"她跟他争论了很久，其实也只是她在说而已，因为汉斯只是一遍又一遍地重复那句话：“他杀了达基和哈基。”但是她无法摆脱从小受的教训和骨子里生来就有的观念。她有着守法的传统，在她看来，正确的行为就是履行法律的要求。她不知道还有什么其他正义的事业可以追求。汉斯想凭他自己的手实施刑罚，这并不比丹宁的所做所为更光明正大。她觉得，两错相加不为对，只有一种办法惩罚丹宁，那就是通过社会已经安排好的法律的途径。最终，汉斯屈从了她的意见。","Long she argued it with him, but the argument was one-sided, for he contented himself with repeating again and again, “He killed Dutchy and Harkey.”But she could not escape from her childhood training nor from the blood that was in her.The heritage of law was hers, and right conduct, to her, was the fulfilment of the law.She could see no other righteous course to pursue.Hans’s taking the law in his own hands was no more justifiable than Dennin’s deed.Two wrongs did not make a right, she contended, and there was only one way to punish Dennin, and that was the legal way arranged by society.At last Hans gave in to her."
"“好吧，”他说，“照你说的办。说不定明天或者后天，他就会打死你和我。”","“All right,” he said.“Have it your own way.And to-morrow or next day look to see him kill you and me.”"
"她摇摇头，伸出手去，要他交出猎枪。他刚要伸手交枪，又迟疑了一下。","She shook her head and held out her hand for the shot-gun.He started to hand it to her, then hesitated."
"“还是让我打死他吧。”他恳求道。","“Better let me shoot him,” he pleaded."
"她摇摇头，于是，他又准备把猎枪交给她。正在这时，门打开了，一个印第安人没有敲门就闯了进来。一阵猛烈的风雪随着他刮进屋子里。两人转过头去面对着印第安人，而汉斯手里还拿着那杆猎枪。闯进来的人看着这幅场景，一点都不害怕。他扫了一眼，看见屋里有死的，也有伤的。他的脸上没有一丝惊讶的表情，连好奇都没有。哈基就死在他脚边，但他根本就不理会。在他看来，哈基的尸体仿佛不存在似的。","Again she shook her head, and again he started to pass her the gun, when the door opened, and an Indian, without knocking, came in.A blast of wind and flurry of snow came in with him.They turned and faced him, Hans still holding the shot-gun.The intruder took in the scene without a quiver.His eyes embraced the dead and wounded in a sweeping glance.No surprise showed in his face, not even curiosity.Harkey lay at his feet, but he took no notice of him.So far as he was concerned, Harkey’s body did not exist."
"“风好大啊，”印第安人说了一句，算是打招呼，“都好吗？你们都好吗？”","“Much wind,” the Indian remarked by way of salutation.“All well?Very well?”"
"汉斯手里仍然拿着那杆枪，他很肯定地觉得那个印第安人把横七竖八的尸体都算在他的头上。他用恳求的目光看着他的妻子。","Hans, still grasping the gun, felt sure that the Indian attributed to him the mangled corpses.He glanced appealingly at his wife."
"“早啊，尼古克，”她说，她的声音暴露了她说话很吃力，“没、没有很好。有大麻烦。”","“Good morning, Negook,” she said, her voice betraying her effort.“No, not very well.Much trouble.”"
"“再见啦，我走了，我忙着呢。”印第安人说完，不慌不忙，又非常小心地跨过地板上的一滩血迹，打开门，走出去了。","“Good-by, I go now, much hurry”, the Indian said, and without semblance of haste, with great deliberation stepping clear of a red pool on the floor, he opened the door and went out."
"两人面面相觑。","The man and woman looked at each other."
"“他觉得是我们干的，”汉斯喘不上气来了，“他觉得是我干的。”","“He thinks we did it,” Hans gasped, “that I did it.”"
"伊迪丝沉默了一会儿。接着，她用简短、务实的口吻说：","Edith was silent for a space.Then she said, briefly, in a businesslike way:"
"“不用管他怎么想。那是以后的事。现在我们得挖两个坟。在这之前我们得把丹宁捆起来，免得他跑掉。”","“Never mind what he thinks.That will come after.At present we have two graves to dig.But first of all, we’ve got to tie up Dennin so he can’t escape.”"
"汉斯根本不愿意碰丹宁一下，不过伊迪丝一个人还是把丹宁的手脚都绑好了。接着，她和汉斯出门走进雪地里。大地封冻了。锄头凿下去根本就没有反应。他们先弄来些木头，扫开积雪，在冰冻的地面上生起一堆火来。烧了一个小时，才解冻了几英尺深的泥土。他们把解冻的泥挖出来，再在里边生一堆火。照这样的速度，他们一个小时只能掘进两三英寸。","Hans refused to touch Dennin, but Edith lashed him securely, hand and foot.Then she and Hans went out into the snow.The ground was frozen.It was impervious to a blow of the pick.They first gathered wood, then scraped the snow away and on the frozen surface built a fire.When the fire had burned for an hour, several inches of dirt had thawed.This they shovelled out, and then built a fresh fire.Their descent into the earth progressed at the rate of two or three inches an hour."
"这是件艰苦的工作。乱雪纷飞，火根本就烧不旺；风灌进他们的衣服，冻得他们浑身冰凉。他们几乎没有说话。大风不容他们开口讲话。除了猜测丹宁的杀人动机之外，他们总是默默无语，心里压着这场惨剧给他们带来的恐惧。到下午一点的时候，汉斯望着小木屋，说他饿了。","It was hard and bitter work.The flurrying snow did not permit the fire to burn any too well, while the wind cut through their clothes and chilled their bodies.They held but little conversation.The wind interfered with speech.Beyond wondering at what could have been Dennin’s motive, they remained silent, oppressed by the horror of the tragedy.At one o’clock, looking toward the cabin, Hans announced that he was hungry."
"“不行，现在不行，汉斯。”伊迪丝答道。“屋子里那个样子，我不能一个人回去做饭。”","“No, not now, Hans,” Edith answered.“I couldn’t go back alone into that cabin the way it is, and cook a meal.”"
"到了两点，汉斯主动提出要跟她一块儿回去，但她坚持要他干下去，到了四点，两个坟才告完成。坟很浅，不到两英尺深，但也够用了。夜幕降临了。汉斯搬出了雪橇，在暴风雪肆虐的黑夜里，拖着两个死人挪向冰冻的坟墓。这场葬礼简直不像样子。雪橇深陷在积雪之中，拉起来非常困难。夫妇二人从昨天开始就粒米未进，现在饥肠辘辘、筋疲力尽，身体已经十分虚弱。他们已经没有抵御风的力气了，有时候一阵狂风吹来，都能将他们掀翻在地。有几次连雪橇都翻了，他们不得不再将可怕的尸体重新装上雪橇。离坟还有一百英尺的时候，他们得爬上一个陡坡；这次，他们像拉雪橇的狗一样，四肢着地，两手深深插进雪地里。即便如此，他们还是有两次给沉重的雪橇拽了回去，从陡坡上滑下来，死人和活人、绳索和雪橇可怕地纠缠在一起。","At two o’clock Hans volunteered to go with her; but she held him to his work, and four o’clock found the two graves completed.They were shallow, not more than two feet deep, but they would serve the purpose.Night had fallen.Hans got the sled, and the two dead men were dragged through the darkness and storm to their frozen sepulchre.The funeral procession was anything but a pageant.The sled sank deep into the drifted snow and pulled hard.The man and the woman had eaten nothing since the previous day, and were weak from hunger and exhaustion.They had not the strength to resist the wind, and at times its buffets hurled them off their feet.On several occasions the sled was overturned, and they were compelled to reload it with its sombre freight.The last hundred feet to the graves was up a steep slope, and this they took on all fours, like sled-dogs, making legs of their arms and thrusting their hands into the snow.Even so, they were twice dragged backward by the weight of the sled, and slid and fell down the hill, the living and the dead, the haul-ropes and the sled, in ghastly entanglement."
"“明天我再来立上两块牌子，写上他们的名字。”垒好两座坟，汉斯说。","“To-morrow I will put up head-boards with their names,” Hans said, when the graves were filled in."
"伊迪丝抽泣起来。她说不出一句整话来，只是断断续续念了几句，权当做完了葬礼祷告；她的丈夫只好扶着她走回木屋去。","Edith was sobbing.A few broken sentences had been all she was capable of in the way of a funeral service, and now her husband was compelled to half-carry her back to the cabin."
"丹宁醒过来了。他在地板上滚来滚去，徒劳地想挣脱束缚。他用亮晶晶的眼睛看着汉斯和伊迪丝，但没有要说话的意思。汉斯还是不愿碰这个凶手，只是愠怒地看着伊迪丝把他拖过地板，拖进男人们的寝室里。但是，她用尽力气，也无法把他抬到铺上。","Dennin was conscious.He had rolled over and over on the floor in vain efforts to free himself.He watched Hans and Edith with glittering eyes, but made no attempt to speak.Hans still refused to touch the murderer, and sullenly watched Edith drag him across the floor to the men’s bunk-room.But try as she would, she could not lift him from the floor into his bunk."
"“还是让我打死他吧，要不然以后会有更多的麻烦。”汉斯最后一次恳求道。","“Better let me shoot him, and we’ll have no more trouble,” Hans said in final appeal."
"伊迪丝摇了摇头，又弯下腰去搬丹宁。令她感到奇怪的是，丹宁的身体很容易就抬起来了；她知道汉斯心软了，在帮他搬。接下来要清扫厨房。惨剧在地板上留下了无法清除的痕迹，汉斯只好把血迹浸染的表面刨掉，扔进炉子付之一炬。","Edith shook her head and bent again to her task.To her surprise the body rose easily, and she knew Hans had relented and was helping her.Then came the cleansing of the kitchen.But the floor still shrieked the tragedy, until Hans planed the surface of the stained wood away and with the shavings made a fire in the stove."
"日子一天天过去了。黑暗和沉寂占据了大部分的时间，只有暴风雪和冰冷的海浪打在岸上的轰隆声送来一些声响。汉斯对伊迪丝唯命是从。他那些惊人的进取精神已经完全消失了。她要用自己的办法处理丹宁，所以汉斯就把这件事完全交给她去办了。","The days came and went.There was much of darkness and silence, broken only by the storms and the thunder on the beach of the freezing surf.Hans was obedient to Edith’s slightest order.All his splendid initiative had vanished.She had elected to deal with Dennin in her way, and so he left the whole matter in her hands."
"这个凶手始终是个威胁。不论何时，他都有机会从束缚中挣脱出来，所以夫妇两人只好日夜监视着他。两人中总有一个人时刻坐在丹宁旁边，拿着那杆装好子弹的猎枪。最初，伊迪丝试着八小时换一班，但是持续的压力太大，后来，她和汉斯就每四个小时轮流休息。他们总得睡会儿，而监视又是整日整夜的，所以他们醒着的时候都是在戒备着丹宁。他们几乎都没有时间做饭和砍柴了。","The murderer was a constant menace.At all times there was the chance that he might free himself from his bonds, and they were compelled to guard him day and night.The man or the woman sat always beside him, holding the loaded shot-gun.At first, Edith tried eight-hour watches, but the continuous strain was too great, and afterwards she and Hans relieved each other every four hours.As they had to sleep, and as the watches extended through the night, their whole waking time was expended in guarding Dennin.They had barely time left over for the preparation of meals and the getting of firewood."
"自从尼古克不合时宜地来了一趟之后，印第安人都躲着这间屋子走了。伊迪丝派汉斯去印第安人的木屋走了一趟，请他们拿一只独木舟把丹宁沿着海岸送到最近的白人定居点或贸易站去，但是汉斯无功而返。伊迪丝只好亲自出马，跟尼古克交涉。他是小村的头领，非常清楚自己的责任，几句话就阐明了他的观点。","Since Negook’s inopportune visit, the Indians had avoided the cabin.Edith sent Hans to their cabins to get them to take Dennin down the coast in a canoe to the nearest white settlement or trading post, but the errand was fruitless.Then Edith went herself and interviewed Negook.He was head man of the little village, keenly aware of his responsibility, and he elucidated his policy thoroughly in few words."
"“这是白人的麻烦，”他说，“不是印第安人的麻烦。要是我的人帮了你，这就变成印第安人的麻烦了。当白人的麻烦和印第安人的麻烦搅在一起，就会变成一个说不清的、没完没了的大麻烦。惹麻烦没好处。我的人没有做错事。他们为什么要帮你，惹上麻烦呢？”","“It is white man’s trouble”, he said, “not Siwash trouble.My people help you, then will it be Siwash trouble too.When white man’s trouble and Siwash trouble come together and make a trouble, it is a great trouble, beyond understanding and without end.Trouble no good.My people do no wrong.What for they help you and have trouble?”"
"因此，伊迪丝·纳尔逊只好回到那间恐怖的屋子，接着做无休无止的四小时轮一班的监视。有时在她值班的时候，她坐在囚徒旁边，腿上搁着装好子弹的猎枪，眼睛就不自觉地合上，打起盹来。这时她总是突然惊醒，一手抓起枪，马上盯着丹宁。这是明显的紧张过度，对她的影响当然好不了。她很害怕那个男人，即使是在她很清醒的时候，只要他在被子里动一动，她也不由自主地浑身一惊，赶紧去抓猎枪。","So Edith Nelson went back to the terrible cabin with its endless alternating four-hour watches.Sometimes, when it was her turn and she sat by the prisoner, the loaded shot-gun in her lap, her eyes would close and she would doze.Always she aroused with a start, snatching up the gun and swiftly looking at him.These were distinct nervous shocks, and their effect was not good on her.Such was her fear of the man, that even though she were wide awake, if he moved under the bedclothes she could not repress the start and the quick reach for the gun."
"这样下去迟早要精神崩溃，她自己也知道这一点。起初是眼珠子跳得厉害，逼得她只好闭上眼睛，以求缓解。不久以后，神经开始抽搐，控制不住，眼皮深受其扰。令她精神紧张的，还有她忘不了那场惨剧。那天早上，这场意外在木屋里发生的情形，都还历历在目。每天喂那个囚徒吃东西的时候，她都得强迫自己咬紧牙关，给自己加劲，也给自己打气。","She was preparing herself for a nervous break-down, and she knew it.First came a fluttering of the eyeballs, so that she was compelled to close her eyes for relief.A little later the eyelids were afflicted by a nervous twitching that she could not control.To add to the strain, she could not forget the tragedy.She remained as close to the horror as on the first morning when the unexpected stalked into the cabin and took possession.In her daily ministrations upon the prisoner she was forced to grit her teeth and steel herself, body and spirit."
"汉斯受到的影响就有所不同。他始终摆脱不了一个念头：打死丹宁是他的应尽的责任。每当他去为这个捆住的人照顾饮食，或者在他旁边戒备的时候，伊迪丝都提心吊胆，害怕汉斯给这幢房子的命案记录再多加上一条。他总是恶狠狠地咒骂丹宁，对他也很粗暴。为了掩盖他的杀心，汉斯有时候还会对妻子说：“慢慢地你就会想让我杀他了，不过那时候我就不杀了。对他动手我觉得恶心。”不止一次，在她不值班的时候，她悄悄摸进屋子，总是发现两个男人像野兽一样恶狠狠地盯着对方，汉斯满脸杀气，而丹宁则像一只被逼到角落里的老鼠一样，一脸凶野的表情。“汉斯！”这时候她就大喊起来，“快醒醒！”汉斯就镇静下来，有些吃惊，有些羞愧，但是并不显得后悔。","Hans was affected differently.He became obsessed by the idea that it was his duty to kill Dennin; and whenever he waited upon the bound man or watched by him, Edith was troubled by the fear that Hans would add another red entry to the cabin’s record.Always he cursed Dennin savagely and handled him roughly.Hans tried to conceal his homicidal mania, and he would say to his wife: “By and by you will want me to kill him, and then I will not kill him.It would make me sick.”But more than once, stealing into the room, when it was her watch off, she would catch the two men glaring ferociously at each other, wild animals the pair of them, in Hans’s face the lust to kill, in Dennin’s the fierceness and savagery of the cornered rat.“Hans!” she would cry, “wake up!” and he would come to a recollection of himself, startled and shamefaced and unrepentant."
"因此，那场意外发生之后，汉斯也成了伊迪丝·纳尔逊要解决的一个问题。起初这只是用怎样的正确方式处理丹宁的问题；她认为的正确方式，是将他囚禁起来，直到将他交给正规的法庭受审。现在汉斯也成了问题，她觉得她还得恢复他的神智，拯救他才行。不久，她还发现自己的体力和忍耐也成了问题。如此重压之下，她就要垮了。她的左臂会不由自主地抖动和抽搐。她用勺子吃东西，食物会洒出来，痛苦的左臂也不听使唤了。她认为这是一种叫“舞蹈病”的运动障碍，还担心病情会越来越严重。她要真垮了，会怎样呢？一想到将来这所房子可能只剩下丹宁和汉斯，她的恐惧就又增加了一层。","So Hans became another factor in the problem the unexpected had given Edith Nelson to solve.At first it had been merely a question of right conduct in dealing with Dennin, and right conduct, as she conceived it, lay in keeping him a prisoner until he could be turned over for trial before a proper tribunal.But now entered Hans, and she saw that his sanity and his salvation were involved.Nor was she long in discovering that her own strength and endurance had become part of the problem.She was breaking down under the strain.Her left arm had developed involuntary jerkings and twitchings.She spilled her food from her spoon, and could place no reliance in her afflicted arm.She judged it to be a form of St. Vitus’s dance, and she feared the extent to which its ravages might go.What if she broke down?And the vision she had of the possible future, when the cabin might contain only Dennin and Hans, was an added horror."
"三天之后，丹宁开口说话了。他的头一个问题是：“你们打算把我怎么办？”他每天都会问这个问题，问好几次。伊迪丝总是回答说，一定会依法惩处他。反过来，她也每天都问他：“你为什么要这么做？”他从来没有回答这个问题。而且，他一听到这个问题就暴跳如雷，想要挣脱身上的粗皮腰带，还威胁说，等他挣脱了他一定会好好收拾这夫妇两人，那是迟早的事情。这个时候，她就会扣紧枪上的两个扳机，万一他真的挣脱了，就用铅弹打死他；而她自己由于紧张和受惊，浑身发抖，心悸而且头晕。","After the third day, Dennin had begun to talk.His first question had been, “What are you going to do with me?”And this question he repeated daily and many times a day.And always Edith replied that he would assuredly be dealt with according to law.In turn, she put a daily question to him,—“Why did you do it?”To this he never replied.Also, he received the question with out-bursts of anger, raging and straining at the rawhide that bound him and threatening her with what he would do when he got loose, which he said he was sure to do sooner or later.At such times she cocked both triggers of the gun, prepared to meet him with leaden death if he should burst loose, herself trembling and palpitating and dizzy from the tension and shock."
"时间一久，丹宁变得老实了。看起来，他好像厌倦了这种躺着不动的姿势。他开始恳求她放了他。他漫天起誓。他说他不会伤害他们。他说他会自己沿着海岸南下，去法官那里自首。他说他愿意把他的那份金子都送给他们。他会一直走进荒野深处，从此不再踏足文明世界。只要她放开他，他甚至愿意自行了断。通常情况下，他这样哀求着，最后都不由自主地说起胡话了，她觉得这个人就快要说得痉挛了；而她总是摇摇头，拒绝放开他，尽管他如此疯狂地哀求。","But in time Dennin grew more tractable.It seemed to her that he was growing weary of his unchanging recumbent position.He began to beg and plead to be released.He made wild promises.He would do them no harm.He would himself go down the coast and give himself up to the officers of the law.He would give them his share of the gold.He would go away into the heart of the wilderness, and never again appear in civilization.He would take his own life if she would only free him.His pleadings usually culminated in involuntary raving, until it seemed to her that he was passing into a fit; but always she shook her head and denied him the freedom for which he worked himself into a passion."
"又过了几个星期，丹宁变得愈加温顺了。他的精神则是越来越明显地萎靡了。“我累了，太累了。”他喃喃地说，像个淘气孩子一样把头在枕头上翻来滚去。过了一段时间，他又会情绪激动地请求处死他，他求伊迪丝杀了他，求汉斯结束他的痛苦，这样他至少可以安安稳稳地长眠。","But the weeks went by, and he continued to grow more tractable.And through it all the weariness was asserting itself more and more.“I am so tired, so tired,” he would murmur, rolling his head back and forth on the pillow like a peevish child.At a little later period he began to make impassioned pleas for death, to beg her to kill him, to beg Hans to put him our of his misery so that he might at least rest comfortably."
"情况迅速变得令人无法忍受。伊迪丝的神经越来越紧张，她知道自己随时可能崩溃。她甚至都不能安心休息，因为她总是害怕在她睡觉的时候，汉斯狂性大发，把丹宁打死。虽然已经进入一月，前来做贸易的纵帆船也还要等几个月才有可能驶入海湾。他们原本没有料到会在木屋里过冬的，食物也要告罄了，而汉斯也不能出去打猎，补充一下给养。为了看守这个囚徒，他们简直给束缚在这座房子上了。","The situation was fast becoming impossible.Edith’s nervousness was increasing, and she knew her break-down might come any time.She could not even get her proper rest, for she was haunted by the fear that Hans would yield to his mania and kill Dennin while she slept.Though January had already come, months would have to elapse before any trading schooner was even likely to put into the bay.Also, they had not expected to winter in the cabin, and the food was running low; nor could Hans add to the supply by hunting.They were chained to the cabin by the necessity of guarding their prisoner."
"总得想个办法才是，伊迪丝明白这一点。她强迫自己回头重新梳理这个问题。她无法摆脱民族的传统，守法的精神与生俱来，也源于她受过的教育。她知道，无论做什么，都必须依照法律。每当猎枪搁在她的膝头，不安分的凶手躺在她身边，暴风雪在屋外怒吼，而她还在长时间地看守的时候，她就原创性地研究一些社会学的问题，自制出一套法律的演化论。她觉得，法律不过是一群人的判断和意志。这群人的人数多寡，无关紧要。她推断道，有很小的人群，比如说瑞士，也有很大的人群，比如说美国。照此推断，这个人群小到什么程度都没有关系。有的国家或许只有一万人，他们集体的判断和意志也成了那个国家的法律。那么，一千人为什么就不能组成一个可以形成法律的人群呢？她这样问自己。如果一千人可以，那么一百人为什么就不行呢？五十个人怎么就不行呢？五个人怎么就不行呢？两个人——怎么就不行呢？","Something must be done, and she knew it.She forced herself to go back into a reconsideration of the problem.She could not shake off the legacy of her race, the law that was of her blood and that had been trained into her.She knew that whatever she did she must do according to the law, and in the long hours of watching, the shot-gun on her knees, the murderer restless beside her and the storms thundering without, she made original sociological researches and worked out for herself the evolution of the law.It came to her that the law was nothing more than the judgment and the will of any group of people.It mattered not how large was the group of people.There were little groups, she reasoned, like Switzerland, and there were big groups like the United States.Also, she reasoned, it did not matter how small was the group of people.There might be only ten thousand people in a country, yet their collective judgment and will would be the law of that country.Why, then, could not one thousand people constitute such a group? she asked herself.And if one thousand, why not one hundred?Why not fifty?Why not five?Why not—two?"
"她被自己的结论吓了一跳，接着就跟汉斯说了一下。起初，汉斯听不明白，后来，他明白过来，又举了一个很有说服力的例子。他谈到了淘金者会议。开会的时候，当地的淘金者就聚到一起，制定法律，执行法律。他说，开会的可能总共也不过十到十五人，但是，多数人的意志就是这十到十五人的法律，谁要违反都会受到惩罚。","She was frightened at her own conclusion, and she talked it over with Hans.At first he could not comprehend, and then, when he did, he added convincing evidence.He spoke of miners’ meetings, where all the men of a locality came together and made the law and executed the law.There might be only ten or fifteen men altogether, he said, but the will of the majority became the law for the whole ten or fifteen, and whoever violated that will was punished."
"伊迪丝心里终于亮堂了。丹宁必须被绞死。汉斯也同意。在他们这三个人的人群里，夫妇俩占了大多数。丹宁应该被绞死，这就是集体的意志。在意志的执行上，伊迪丝很认真，执意遵照习惯的形式。但是，这个人群太小了，她和汉斯不得不同时担任证人、陪审团、法官——以及最后的行刑人。她郑重其事地指控迈克尔·丹宁谋杀了哈基和达基，而囚徒就躺在铺上，听取了证词，先是汉斯的，接着是伊迪丝的。他既不认罪，也不申明自己无罪，当伊迪丝问他要说什么为自己辩护的时候，他也保持沉默。她和汉斯，不用离开席位，就宣布陪审团裁定犯人有罪。接着，她充当法官，进行宣判。她的声音颤抖着，眼皮乱跳，左臂抽搐，但她终究读完了判决结果。","Edith saw her way clear at last.Dennin must hang.Hans agreed with her.Between them they constituted the majority of this particular group.It was the group-will that Dennin should be hanged.In the execution of this will Edith strove earnestly to observe the customary forms, but the group was so small that Hans and she had to serve as witnesses, as jury, and as judges—also as executioners.She formally charged Michael Dennin with the murder of Dutchy and Harkey, and the prisoner lay in his bunk and listened to the testimony, first of Hans, and then of Edith.He refused to plead guilty or not guilty, and remained silent when she asked him if he had anything to say in his own defence.She and Hans, without leaving their seats, brought in the jury’s verdict of guilty.Then, as judge, she imposed the sentence.Her voice shook, her eyelids twitched, her left arm jerked, but she carried it out."
"“迈克尔·丹宁，三天之内，你将被处以绞刑，剥夺生命。”","“Michael Dennin, in three days’ time you are to be hanged by the neck until you are dead.”"
"这就是判决结果。这个人不自觉地舒了一口气，然后大喇喇地笑起来，说：“那么，这张该死的床再也不会弄疼我的背了，真是欣慰啊。”","Such was the sentence.The man breathed an unconscious sigh of relief, then laughed defiantly, and said, “Thin I’m thinkin’ the damn bunk won’t be achin’ me back anny more, an’ that’s a consolation.”"
"宣判之后，一种轻松的感觉似乎传遍了所有人，在丹宁身上表现得尤为明显。他身上那种阴郁和抗拒完全消失了，他跟两个看管他的人亲切地聊天，甚至不时蹦出以前那样颇有才气的俏皮话。伊迪丝给他读《圣经》，他也感到很满意。她读的是《新约》部分，读到浪荡子和十字架上的贼的时候，丹宁听得尤为认真。","With the passing of the sentence a feeling of relief seemed to communicate itself to all of them.Especially was it noticeable in Dennin.All sullenness and defiance disappeared, and he talked sociably with his captors, and even with flashes of his old-time wit.Also, he found great satisfaction in Edith’s reading to him from the Bible.She read from the New Testament, and he took keen interest in the prodigal son and the thief on the cross."
"确定执行绞刑的前一天，伊迪丝又问了那个老问题：“你为什么要那么做？”丹宁回答说：“很简单。我当时只是想……”","On the day preceding that set for the execution, when Edith asked her usual question, “Why did you do it?”Dennin answered, “’Tis very simple.I was thinkin’—”"
"但她马上要他停住，让他等一等，然后奔到汉斯的床边。这正是他轮休的时候，他从梦中被吵醒，揉着眼睛，抱怨了几句。","But she hushed him abruptly, asked him to wait, and hurried to Hans’s bedside.It was his watch off, and he came out of his sleep, rubbing his eyes and grumbling."
"“快去，”她吩咐到，“把尼古克找来，另外再找一个印第安人。迈克尔要招供了。一定要把他们带来。拿上枪，要是不得已，就用枪指着他们，让他们过来。”","“Go,” she told him, “and bring up Negook and one other Indian.Michael’s going to confess.Make them come.Take the rifle along and bring them up at the point of it if you have to.”"
"半个小时过后，尼古克和他的叔叔哈迪克万就被领进了这间死亡之所。他们本不情愿来，汉斯拿着枪把他们押了过来。","Half an hour later Negook and his uncle, Hadikwan, were ushered into the death chamber.They came unwillingly, Hans with his rifle herding them along."
"“尼古克，”她说，“这不会给你和你的人带来麻烦。你要做的只是坐在这儿，听一听，了解一下情况。”","“Negook,” Edith said, “there is to be no trouble for you and your people.Only is it for you to sit and do nothing but listen and understand.”"
"就这样，迈克尔·丹宁在被判处死刑之后，终于公开招认了他的罪行。他一边说，伊迪丝一边记，两个印第安人在一旁听着；为了防止两个见证人逃走，汉斯就守在门边。","Thus did Michael Dennin, under sentence of death, make public confession of his crime.As he talked, Edith wrote his story down, while the Indians listened, and Hans guarded the door for fear the witnesses might bolt."
"丹宁说，他有十五年没有回老家了，他一直想带着一大笔钱回去，让他的老母亲可以舒舒服服地安享余生。","He had not been home to the old country for fifteen years, Dennin explained, and it had always been his intention to return with plenty of money and make his old mother comfortable for the rest of her days."
"“一千六百块能干啥呢？”他问道，“我想要的是所有的金子，那八千块的金子。这样我就可以风风光光地回去了。我跟自己讲，我可以杀了你们，跑到斯卡圭去报告说你们是让印第安人杀死的，然后一溜烟跑回爱尔兰——还有比这更容易的吗？我就开始动手杀你们，但是，就像哈基喜欢说的那样，我弄了太大的一块东西，我自己都无法吞下去。这就是我的供诉。我干了恶事，现在，如果上帝愿意接受，我也愿意向上帝赎罪。”","“An’ how was I to be doin’ it on sixteen hundred?” he demanded.“What I was after wantin’ was all the goold, the whole eight thousan’.Thin I cud go back in style.What ud be aisier, thinks I to myself, than to kill all iv yez, report it at Skaguay for an Indian-killin’, an’ thin pull out for Ireland?An’ so I started in to kill all iv yez, but, as Harkey was fond of sayin’, I cut out too large a chunk an’ fell down on the swallowin’ iv it.An’ that’s me confession.I did me duty to the devil, an’ now, God willin’, I’ll do me duty to God.”"
"“尼古克和哈迪克万，你们都听到了这个白人男子所说的话，”伊迪丝向两个印第安人说，“他的话都记在这张纸上了，现在轮到你们来画个押，就在这张纸上。这样，要是以后有白人来到这儿，他们就能知道你们做了旁听的证人。”","“Negook and Hadikwan, you have heard the white man’s words,” Edith said to the Indians.“His words are here on this paper, and it is for you to make a sign, thus, on the paper, so that white men to come after will know that you have heard.”"
"两个印第安人在他们的名字后面划了两个十字，然后他们收到两张传票，请他们次日带着部落里所有的人再来做一次见证，接着就获准离开了。","The two Siwashes put crosses opposite their signatures, received a summons to appear on the morrow with all their tribe for a further witnessing of things, and were allowed to go."
"他们把丹宁的手松开一些，使他能在文件上签字。接着，沉默又笼罩了整个屋子。汉斯很不安分，伊迪丝也觉得不舒服。丹宁仰面躺着，直勾勾地盯着裂缝给苔藓填满的屋顶。","Dennin’s hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.Then a silence fell in the room.Hans was restless, and Edith felt uncomfortable.Dennin lay on his back, staring straight up at the moss-chinked roof."
"“现在我要向上帝赎罪了。”他喃喃自语道。接着，他转过头去对着伊迪丝。“给我念一段《圣经》吧，”他说；接着，他又像开玩笑似的加了一句：“或许这样我就能忘了这铺有多难受。”","“An’ now I’ll do me duty to God,” he murmured.He turned his head toward Edith.“Read to me,” he said, “from the book;” then added, with a glint of playfulness, “Mayhap ’twill help me to forget the bunk.”"
"行刑的这一天，天气晴朗，寒气逼人。温度计直指向零下二十五度，寒风凛冽，穿透衣服，直刺进皮肉、骨头。这么多周过去了，今天丹宁第一次站了起来。他的肌肉已经很久没有活动了，他也很久没有保持直立姿态了，以致于他差点站不起来了。","The day of the execution broke clear and cold.The thermometer was down to twenty-five below zero, and a chill wind was blowing which drove the frost through clothes and flesh to the bones.For the first time in many weeks Dennin stood upon his feet.His muscles had remained inactive so long, and he was so out of practice in maintaining an erect position, that he could scarcely stand."
"他前后摇晃着，蹒跚前行，用捆着的双手抓住伊迪丝，以免跌倒。","He reeled back and forth, staggered, and clutched hold of Edith with his bound hands for support."
"“真的，我有点头晕呢。”他无力地笑了笑。","“Sure, an’ it’s dizzy I am,” he laughed weakly."
"过了一会儿他又说：“挺高兴的，事情总算过去了。我知道，那张该死的床迟早会把我弄死的。”","A moment later he said, “An’ it’s glad I am that it’s over with.That damn bunk would iv been the death iv me, I know.”"
"当伊迪丝给他扣上帽子，想把帽沿拉下来遮住他的耳朵时，他笑了，说：","When Edith put his fur cap on his head and proceeded to pull the flaps down over his ears, he laughed and said:"
"“你这是要想干什么呢？”","“What are you doin’ that for?”"
"“外面很冷。”她答道。","“It’s freezing cold outside”, she answered."
"“十分钟以后，可怜的迈克尔·丹宁就是冻坏了一只耳朵，又有什么关系呢？”他问道。","“An’ in tin minutes’ time what’ll matter a frozen ear or so to poor Michael Dennin?” he asked."
"她本来做好了心理准备，要挺过最后这场考验，但丹宁的话打乱了她的镇静。迄今为止，一切都像是梦中的幻影，而他说的残酷的实话令她大为吃惊，她睁大眼睛，看着即将发生的现实。她的悲痛没能瞒过爱尔兰人的眼睛。","She had nerved herself for the last culminating ordeal, and his remark was like a blow to her self-possession.So far, everything had seemed phantom-like, as in a dream, but the brutal truth of what he had said shocked her eyes wide open to the reality of what was taking place.Nor was her distress unnoticed by the Irishman."
"“对不起，我不该胡诌两句来让你难过，”他懊悔地说，“我不是故意的。今天对迈克尔·丹宁来说，是个伟大的日子，他真是兴高采烈啊。”","“I’m sorry to be troublin’ you with me foolish spache,” he said regretfully.“I mint nothin’ by it.’Tis a great day for Michael Dennin, an’ he’s as gay as a lark.”"
"他吹起了欢快的口哨，可是很快就变成了悲惨的调子，一会儿就停了。","He broke out in a merry whistle, which quickly became lugubrious and ceased."
"“我倒是希望能有一位牧师，”他若有所求地说，不过很快又加了一句：“不过，迈克尔·丹宁都是走南闯北的老手了，上路前没有这么奢侈的待遇，倒也无所谓。”","“I’m wishin’ there was a priest,” he said wistfully; then added swiftly, “But Michael Dennin’s too old a campaigner to miss the luxuries when he hits the trail.”"
"他已经非常虚弱了，也长时间没有走路了，当门打开，他跨出去的时候，风差点把他掀翻。伊迪丝和汉斯一边一个架着他走出来，他就跟他们讲着笑话，好让他们心情好些；只有说到怎样将他那份金子寄给他远在爱尔兰的母亲时，他才突然停止了说笑。","He was so very weak and unused to walking that when the door opened and he passed outside, the wind nearly carried him off his feet.Edith and Hans walked on either side of him and supported him, the while he cracked jokes and tried to keep them cheerful, breaking off, once, long enough to arrange the forwarding of his share of the gold to his mother in Ireland."
"他们爬上一座小山丘，来到林间一处空旷的地方。雪地里立着一只圆桶，桶的四周严肃地站着一圈人，他们是尼古克、哈迪克万和当地所有的印第安人，连孩子和狗都带来了；他们要来看看白人的法律是怎么运作的。旁边还有汉斯烧融了冻土挖出的墓穴。","They climbed a slight hill and came out into an open space among the trees.Here, circled solemnly about a barrel that stood on end in the snow, were Negook and Hadikwan, and all the Siwashes down to the babies and the dogs, come to see the way of the white man’s law.Near by was an open grave which Hans had burned into the frozen earth."
"丹宁很老练地看了看准备好的东西；他看到了墓穴、圆桶，注意到了绳子的粗细和搭绳子的树枝的粗细。","Dennin cast a practical eye over the preparations, noting the grave, the barrel, the thickness of the rope, and the diameter of the limb over which the rope was passed."
"“汉斯，要是由我来给你准备这些东西，我没法办得比你更好了。”","“Sure, an’ I couldn’t iv done better meself, Hans, if it’d been for you.”"
"说了这句俏皮话，他自己哈哈大笑起来，但是汉斯板着一张阴沉吓人的脸，似乎只有世界末日的号角声才能化开。汉斯也觉得很难受。他现在明白了，要把一个同伴送去另一个世界是一件多么艰巨的任务。伊迪丝倒是早就明白了，但即使明白了，这件任务也没有轻松半分。现在她非常怀疑自己能不能撑到任务结束。她感到有一种不可遏制的冲动，想要尖叫、狂喊，想要瘫倒在雪地里，用双手蒙住眼睛，转身乱跑进森林里，只要能离开，跑去哪里都行。她能够挺起胸膛，继续做她必须完成的事，完全是凭借着灵魂的至高力量。在这个过程中，她感激丹宁，因为他帮助她度过了这一切。","He laughed loudly at his own sally, but Hans’s face was frozen into a sullen ghastliness that nothing less than the trump of doom could have broken.Also, Hans was feeling very sick.He had not realized the enormousness of the task of putting a fellow-man out of the world.Edith, on the other hand, had realized; but the realization did not make the task any easier.She was filled with doubt as to whether she could hold herself together long enough to finish it.She felt incessant impulses to scream, to shriek, to collapse into the snow, to put her hands over her eyes and turn and run blindly away, into the forest, anywhere, away.It was only by a supreme effort of soul that she was able to keep upright and go on and do what she had to do.And in the midst of it all she was grateful to Dennin for the way he helped her."
"“搭把手。”丹宁对汉斯说；靠着汉斯的帮助，他总算踩上了圆桶。","“Lind me a hand,” he said to Hans, with whose assistance he managed to mount the barrel."
"他弯下腰去，好让伊迪丝把绳子套在他的脖子上。接着他又站直了，而汉斯拉紧了他头顶上套在树枝上的绳子。","He bent over so that Edith could adjust the rope about his neck.Then he stood upright while Hans drew the rope taut across the overhead branch."
"“迈克尔·丹宁，你还有什么要说的吗？”尽管声音颤抖，伊迪丝还是清楚地问出了这句话。","“Michael Dennin, have you anything to say?”Edith asked in a clear voice that shook in spite of her."
"丹宁两脚在圆桶上挪了挪，有点局促地看着下面，好像第一次发表演讲似的，然后清了清嗓子。","Dennin shuffled his feet on the barrel, looked down bashfully like a man making his maiden speech, and cleared his throat."
"“很高兴一切就要过去了，”他说，“你们始终把我当成基督徒来看待，我衷心感谢你们对我的好意。”","“I’m glad it’s over with,” he said.“You’ve treated me like a Christian, an’ I’m thankin’ you hearty for your kindness.”"
"“愿上帝收留你这个悔过的罪人。”伊迪丝说。","“Then may God receive you, a repentant sinner,” she said."
"“嗯，”他答道，他那低沉的嗓音回应着她尖细的声音，“愿上帝收留我这个悔过的罪人。”","“Ay,” he answered, his deep voice as a response to her thin one, “may God receive me, a repentant sinner.”"
"“别了，迈克尔。”她喊道，声音充满了绝望。","“Good-by, Michael,” she cried, and her voice sounded desperate."
"她使出全身的力量去推那个圆桶，但是怎么都推不倒。","She threw her weight against the barrel, but it did not overturn."
"“汉斯，快！帮我一下！”她无力地喊道。","“Hans!Quick!Help me!” she cried faintly."
"她觉得她把最后一丝力气都使出来了，但是那个木桶纹丝不动。汉斯连忙跑过去，把桶一下子就从迈克尔·丹宁脚下推开了。","She could feel her last strength going, and the barrel resisted her.Hans hurried to her, and the barrel went out from under Michael Dennin."
"她背过身去，拿指头堵住耳朵。接着，她笑了起来，尖利、刺耳，像金属的声音；汉斯吓了一跳，虽然他经历了整个惨剧，但是都没有受过如此的惊吓。伊迪丝·纳尔逊终于崩溃了。即使在她歇斯底里发泄的时候，她也知道自己垮了；她很高兴，在那么紧张的状态下苦撑过来了，直到所有事情就圆满完成。她摇摇晃晃地走向汉斯。","She turned her back, thrusting her fingers into her ears.Then she began to laugh, harshly, sharply, metallically; and Hans was shocked as he had not been shocked through the whole tragedy.Edith Nelson’s break-down had come.Even in her hysteria she knew it, and she was glad that she had been able to hold up under the strain until everything had been accomplished.She reeled toward Hans."
"“扶我到屋里去，汉斯。”她勉强说出几个字来。","“Take me to the cabin, Hans,” she managed to articulate."
"“让我休息一下，”她又说，“休息一下，好好休息一下，休息一下。”","“And let me rest,” she added.“Just let me rest, and rest, and rest.”"
"汉斯的臂膀搂着她，支撑着她，引导着她虚弱的脚步，她就这样从雪地上走回去了。而那些印第安人还留在原地，神色严峻地看着白人的法律怎样迫使一个人吊在半空晃来晃去。","With Hans’s arm around her, supporting her weight and directing her helpless steps, she went off across the snow.But the Indians remained solemnly to watch the working of the white man’s law that compelled a man to dance upon the air."
