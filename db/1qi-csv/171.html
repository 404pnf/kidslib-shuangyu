		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他溜达到拐角处，来回扫视着这条交叉路，却什么也没有看到，只有在一个个十字路口处那路灯照射下的安全之地给人些许慰藉。接着，他又按原路溜达回去了。他像个人影一般，在半明半暗间悄无声息地潜行，没有多余的动作。他也十分警觉，就像丛林中的野兽，极其敏锐、敏感。黑暗中，若他的周围有其他人活动，动作要比他更隐蔽才能不被他察觉。</td>
		<td class="en">He strolled to the corner and glanced up and down the intersecting street, but saw nothing save the oases of light shed by the street lamps at the successive crossings.Then he strolled back the way he had come.He was a shadow of a man sliding noiselessly and without undue movement through the semi-darkness.Also he was very alert, like a wild animal in the jungle, keenly perceptive and receptive.The movement of another in the darkness about him would need to have been more shadowy than he to have escaped him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他不仅能够洞察有关当前国家大事的宣传，还能够更加微妙地感知近旁的环境。刚才他在一所房子前驻足片刻，就知道里面有孩子。而知道这些，他并不需要费什么力气。就这一点来说，他甚至都没意识到自己知道了，因为他对房子的印象太玄妙了。然而有时，不知什么跟房子有关的行为就会迫使他认定房子里就有孩子。他熟知这片街区，自己却全然没意识到。</td>
		<td class="en">In addition to the running advertisement of the state of affairs carried to him by his senses, he had a subtler perception, a feel, of the atmosphere around him.He knew that the house in front of which he paused for a moment contained children.Yet by no willed effort of perception did he have this knowledge.For that matter, he was not even aware that he knew, so occult was the impression.Yet, did a moment arise in which action, in relation to that house, were imperative, he would have acted on the assumption that it contained children.He was not aware of all that he knew about the neighborhood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同样，他也不知道自己怎么就判断出从交叉路那边传来的脚步声没什么危险。还没看到那个步行的人，他就知道这人只是有事耽搁了，这会儿正匆忙赶路回家。步行的那个人在交叉口露面，沿街越走越远，最后消失不见了。一直观察着街上动静的这个人注意到，街角房子的窗户里突然有火光闪现，随之渐暗，于是他判断出那是火柴将要燃尽了。这是他对常见现象有意识地作出的判断，而他的脑海中又闪过了一个想法，“想知道几点了。”另一幢房子的一个房间里也亮起了灯。灯光暗淡平稳，他感觉那是间病房。</td>
		<td class="en">In the same way, he knew not how, he knew that no danger threatened in the footfalls that came up the cross street.Before he saw the walker, he knew him for a belated pedestrian hurrying home.The walker came into view at the crossing and disappeared on up the street.The man that watched noted a light that flared up in the window of a house on the corner, and as it died down he knew it for an expiring match.This was conscious identification of familiar phenomena, and through his mind flitted the thought, “Wanted to know what time.”In another house one room was lighted.The light burned dimly and steadily and he had the feel that it was a sick-room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他对位于对面街区中间的那幢房子特别感兴趣。这幢房子是他最为留意的。不管他朝哪个方向看，也不管他向哪个方向走，最后，他的视线总会回到这幢房子上，脚步也总会停在它的跟前。除了门廊上方的一扇窗子开着外，这房子没什么特别的。没什么东西进去或者打里面出来。什么事也没发生。没有一扇窗子里透着灯光，或是灯光亮了又灭了。可这就是他要考虑的关键。每次预卜一下街区的状况后，他都会回到这幢房子这儿。</td>
		<td class="en">He was especially interested in a house across the street in the middle of the block.To this house he paid most attention.No matter what way he looked, nor what way he walked, his looks and his steps always returned to it.Except for an open window above the porch, there was nothing unusual about the house.Nothing came in nor out.Nothing happened.There were no lighted windows, nor had lights appeared and disappeared in any of the windows.Yet it was the central point of his consideration.He rallied to it each time after a divination of the state of the neighborhood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管他能感知别的事情，却对这种能力不够自信。自己的处境危险，他很清楚。行人偶然过路时，尽管他没受到脚步声的打扰，却也像只胆怯的鹿一样紧张敏感，容易受到惊吓。他知道可能还有其他人在黑暗中潜行以探听消息——这些人和他一样动作灵活、感觉敏锐，也能够预卜未知。</td>
		<td class="en">Despite his feel of things, he was not confident.He was supremely conscious of the precariousness of his situation.Though unperturbed by the footfalls of the chance pedestrian, he was as keyed up and sensitive and ready to be startled as any timorous deer.He was aware of the possibility of other intelligences prowling about in the darkness—intelligences similar to his own in movement, perception, and divination.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沿街看去，他瞥见远处有什么东西在动。他知道那不会是回家晚了的人，而是威胁，是危险。他朝着街对面的房子吹了两声口哨，接着像个影子似的渐渐消失在去往街角的方向，然后躲进了街角。他就停在那里仔细观察着周围。定了定神，他从街角回头望过去，仔细端详着那移动着的，不断靠近的物体。他预测得没错，那是个警察。</td>
		<td class="en">Far down the street he caught a glimpse of something that moved.And he knew it was no late home-goer, but menace and danger.He whistled twice to the house across the street, then faded away shadow-like to the corner and around the corner.Here he paused and looked about him carefully.Reassured, he peered back around the corner and studied the object that moved and that was coming nearer.He had divined aright.It was a policeman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个人沿着交叉路溜到下一个街角，并在街角的掩护下观察着自己刚刚离开的那个街角。他看见警察从那儿路过又径直沿街走了下去。他顺着警察的路线走，在下一个街角处又看着警察经过，之后照原路返回。他朝着街对面的房子吹了一声口哨，过段时间又吹了一声。之前的两声口哨意在警告，这次的口哨声是让里面的人安心。</td>
		<td class="en">The man went down the cross street to the next corner, from the shelter of which he watched the corner he had just left.He saw the policeman pass by, going straight on up the street.He paralleled the policeman’s course, and from the next corner again watched him go by; then he returned the way he had come.He whistled once to the house across the street, and after a time whistled once again.There was reassurance in the whistle, just as there had been warning in the previous double whistle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他看到门廊顶上一个黑色的硕大轮廓慢慢顺着柱子下来了。接着那轮廓走下台阶，穿过狭小的铁门，沿着人行道向前走去，逐渐显出了人的身形。放哨的人仍在街的这边，与对面那个人并排着向拐角处走去，走到那儿时穿过街道与他会合了。站在他攀谈的这个人身边，他显得很矮小。</td>
		<td class="en">He saw a dark bulk outline itself on the roof of the porch and slowly descend a pillar.Then it came down the steps, passed through the small iron gate, and went down the sidewalk, taking on the form of a man.He that watched kept on his own side the street and moved on abreast to the corner, where he crossed over and joined the other.He was quite small alongside the man he accosted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“事办得怎么样了，马特？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“How’d you make out, Matt?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个人含含糊糊地嘟囔着，静静地走了几步。</td>
		<td class="en">The other grunted indistinctly, and walked on in silence a few steps.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想我搞到宝贝了。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I reckon I landed the goods,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆在黑暗中低声笑了笑，等着下文。走了几个街区，他等得不耐烦了。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim chuckled in the darkness, and waited for further information. The blocks passed by under their feet, and he grew impatient.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，东西怎么样啊？”他问道，“你这次到底弄到多少？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, how about them goods?” he asked.“What kind of a haul you make, anyway?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我哪有时间算呀，不过挺值钱的。吉姆，我能告诉你的就这么多，挺值钱的。我没去想它到底值多少钱。等我们回到房间再说吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I was too busy to figger it out, but it’s fat.I can tell you that much Jim, it’s fat.I don’t cast to think how fat it is.Wait till we get to the room.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在下一个交口路口处，吉姆在路灯的灯光下热切地看着他，注意到他脸上的表情不太高兴，左胳膊也不大对劲。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim looked at him keenly under the street lamp of the next crossing and saw that his face was a trifle grim and that he carried his left arm peculiarly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你胳膊怎么了？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s the matter with your arm?” he demanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让那个小个儿家伙给咬了一口。希望我不会得狂犬病。有时候让人咬了就会得狂犬病，不是吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“The little cuss bit me.Hope I don’t get hydrophoby.Folks gets hydrophoby from manbite sometimes, don’t they?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“和你搏斗了，嗯？”吉姆追问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Gave you a fight, eh?” Jim asked encouragingly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个人却只是嘟嘟囔囔。</td>
		<td class="en">The other grunted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“想从你那儿知道点儿什么真是难死了。”吉姆不耐烦地冒出句话来，“和我说说吧，和我说说又不赔钱。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re harder’n hell to get information from,” Jim burst out irritably.“Tell us about it.You ain’t goin’ to lose money just a-tellin’ a guy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想我是把他掐死了。”他回答道。接着他又解释说，“他听到我的动静醒了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I guess I choked him some,” came the answer.Then, by way of explanation, “He woke up on me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你做得很利索，我一点儿声音也没听见。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You did it neat.I never heard a sound.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“吉姆，”另一个人很严肃地说，“这可是杀头的事啊。我把他解决了，不过也是不得已啊。谁让他听到我的动静醒了呢。你得让我躲一阵子。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Jim,” the other said with seriousness, “it’s a hangin’ matter.I fixed ’m.I had to.He woke up on me.You an’ me’s got to do some layin’ low for a spell.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆会意地轻轻吹了声口哨。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim gave a low whistle of comprehension.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“之前你听见我吹口哨了吗？”他突然问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did you hear me whistle?” he asked suddenly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然。那时我都办好了，正要出来呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sure.I was all done.I was just comin’ out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“刚才是个警察。不过他一点儿也没注意到。他正好路过那儿，不过没停步，一直走到没影了。然后我就回来给你放了信。之后什么事耽搁你这么久？”</td>
		<td class="en">“It was a bull.But he wasn’t on a little bit.Went right by an’ kept a-paddin’ the hoof out a sight.Then I come back an’ gave you the whitle.What made you take so long after that?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我等着是为了确保万无一失。”马特解释说，“听见你又吹了声口哨，我太高兴了。干等着可是不好过。我只好坐在那儿想啊想啊……唉，想各种各样的事儿。人能想这么多事儿真是不容易。可过了一会儿偏偏有只可恶的猫围着房子转，叫得我心烦。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I was waitin’ to make sure,” Matt explained.“I was mighty glad when I heard you whistle again.It’s hard work waitin’.I just sat there an’ thought an’ thought… oh, all kinds of things.It’s remarkable what a fellow’ll think about.And then there was a darn cat that kept movin’ around the house an’ botherin’ me with its noises.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“而且还很值钱！”吉姆高兴却又不着边际地大声说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“An’ it’s fat!” Jim exclaimed irrelevantly and with joy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我明确地告诉你，吉姆，很值钱。我也急着想再看一眼。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m sure tellin’ you, Jim, it’s fat.I’m plum’ anxious for another look at ’em.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个人不知不觉地加快了步子。不过他们还是很谨慎，没有放松警惕。为了避开警察，他们两次改道，确定没人看见的时候才闪进市中心一栋廉价公寓房的门厅。</td>
		<td class="en">Unconsciously the two men quickened their pace.Yet they did not relax from their caution.Twice they changed their course in order to avoid policemen, and they made very sure that they were not obvious when they dived into the dark hallway of a cheap rooming house down town.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >进了顶层自己的房间，他们才划着火柴。吉姆点灯的时候，马特锁上了门，还插上了插销。转过身来，他发现同伴正期盼地等着。马特看见另一个人这么急切，自顾自地笑了笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Not until they had gained their own room on the top floor did they scratch a match.While Jim lighted a lamp, Matt locked the door and throw the bolts into place.As he turned, he noticed that his partner was waiting expectantly.Matt smiled to himself at the other’s eagerness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个手电筒还能用。”他说着掏出一个小手电筒，检查了一下。“不过我们得弄块新电池。手电的光很弱了。刚才有一两回我都觉得它会把我丢在黑暗中了。那房子的布局又很奇怪，我差点儿走丢了。他的房间在左边，我都有点儿被弄糊涂了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Them search-lights is all right,” he said, drawing forth a small pocket electric lamp and examining it.“But we got to get a new battery.It’s runnin’ pretty weak.I thought once or twice it’d leave me in the dark.Funny arrangements in that house.I near got lost.His room was on the left, an’ that fooled me some.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我告诉你了是在左边。”吉姆打断他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I told you it was on the left,” Jim interrupted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你跟我说的是在右边。”马特接着说，“我想我知道你和我说了什么，这是你画的地图。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You told me it was on the right,” Matt went on.“I guess I know what you told me, an’ there’s the map you drew.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在马甲兜里摸了摸，掏出一张折起来的纸条。他一边打开，吉姆一边弯下身子来看。</td>
		<td class="en">Fumbling in his vest pocket, he drew out a folded slip of paper.As he unfoIded it, Jim bent over and looked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我还真弄错了。”他承认道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I did make a mistake,” he confessed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你当然是弄错了，叫我猜了好一会儿呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You sure did.It got me guessin’ some for a while.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过现在没什么关系了，”吉姆大声说，“让我看看你都弄了些什么。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But it don’t matter now,” Jim cried.“Let’s see what you got.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还有关系，”马特反驳说，“关系重大……对我来说。风险都是我担着。我深入虎穴，你却只是呆在大街上。你可得长点儿出息，再仔细点儿。好了，叫你看看。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It does matter,” Matt retorted.“It matters a lot… to me.I’ve got to run all the risk.I put my head in the trap while you stay on the street.You got to get on to yourself an’ be more careful.All right, I’ll show you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他松松垮垮地把手伸进裤兜里，掏出一把小钻石。他将钻石撒在油腻的桌子上，排成亮闪闪的一溜儿。吉姆发出一声咒骂。</td>
		<td class="en">He dipped loosely into his trousers pocket and brought out a handful of small diamonds.He spilled them out in a blazing stream on the greasy table.Jim let out a great oath.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这不算什么，”马特得意洋洋地说，“我还没开始呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s nothing,” Matt said with triumphant complacence.“I ain’t begun yet.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他从一个又一个的兜里不断掏出战利品。好多钻石包在麂皮里，比头一把的要大。他从一个兜里掏出一把切割得很小的宝石。</td>
		<td class="en">From one pocket after another he continued bringing forth the spoil.There were many diamonds wrapped in chamois skin that were larger than those in the first handful.From one pocket he brought out a handful of very small cut gems.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不值钱的东西。”他一边把它们单独撒在桌子上的一块地方，一边说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Sun dust,” he remarked, as he spilled them on the table in a space by themselves.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉姆检查着。</td>
		<td class="en">Jim examined them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“都一样啊，它们零售一个也就几美元。”他说，“就这些吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Just the same, they retail for a couple of dollars each,” he said.“Is that all?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还不够多吗？”另一个人不满地反问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ain’t it enough?” the other demanded in an aggrieved tone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然够多了，”吉姆毫无异议地回答道，“比我预料的要好。我觉得这一堆至少得值一万。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sure it is,” Jim answered with unqualified approval.“Better’n I expected.I wouldn’t take a cent less than ten thousan’ for the bunch.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一万，”马特冷笑着说，“它们得值两万，况且我还不懂珠宝。看这个大家伙！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ten thousan’,” Matt sneered.“They’re worth twic’t that, an’ I don’t know anything about joolery, either.Look at that big boy!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他带着行家的架势从这堆闪烁的珠宝里挑出那一个，拿到灯前掂量着，鉴定着。</td>
		<td class="en">He picked it out from the sparkling heap and held it near to the lamp with the air of an expert, weighing and judging.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这一个就得值一千。”吉姆很快给出了判断。</td>
		<td class="en">“Worth a thousan’ all by its lonely,” was Jim’s quicker judgment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一千你个奶奶，”马特轻蔑地回答，“三千你也买不下来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A thousan’ your grandmother,” was Matt’s scornful rejoinder.“You couldn’t buy it for three.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让我清醒清醒！我不是在做梦吧！”宝石的光芒映在吉姆的眼睛里，他开始挑出大个的一一检查。“咱们是富人了，马特——咱们要成为上流社会的常客了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wake me up!I’m dreamin’!”The sparkle of the gems was in Jim’s eyes, and he began sorting out the larger diamonds and examining them.“We’re rich men, Matt—we’ll be regular swells.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“得多少年才能花完啊。”这是马特更实际的想法。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’ll take years to get rid of ’em,” was Matt’s more practical thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可想想我们会过得多好！什么都不用做，就是花钱，一直到花光它们。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But think how we’ll live!Nothin’ to do but spend the money an go on gettin’ rid of ’cm.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马特的眼睛开始放光了，虽然有些忧郁，却也是他冷漠的本性使然。</td>
		<td class="en">Matt’s eyes were beginning to sparkle, though sombrely, as his phlegmatic nature woke up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我告诉过你了，我没去想会值多少钱。”他低声说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I told you I didn’t cast think how fat it was,” he murmured in a low voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这下可发大财了！发大财了！”另一个人更加狂喜地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“What a killin’! What a killin’!” was the other’s more ecstatic utterance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我差点忘了。”马特说着把手插进了大衣里面的兜里。</td>
		<td class="en">“I almost forgot,” Matt said, thrusting his hand into his inside coat pocket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一串大珍珠从包着的绵纸和麂皮里冒了出来。吉姆几乎都没看一眼。</td>
		<td class="en">A string of large pearls emerged from wrappings of tissue paper and chamois skin.Jim scarcely glanced at them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它们可值钱了。”他说道，接着又看看钻石。</td>
		<td class="en">“They’re worth money,” he said, and returned to the diamonds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个人都沉默了下来。吉姆摆弄着珠宝，用手指把它们分成堆，又在桌子上平摊开。他瘦削、枯槁、紧张、暴躁、敏感而且贫血——是个典型的贫民区孩子，样子丑陋古怪，小眼睛，脸上永远是一副极度饥饿的样子，样子粗鲁野蛮、鬼鬼祟祟，堕落的标记已经渗透到骨子里了。</td>
		<td class="en">A silence fell on the two men.Jim played with the gems, running them through his fingers, sorting them into piles, and spreading them out flat and wide.He was a slender, wizened man, nervous, irritable, high-strung, and anaemic—a typical child of the gutter, with unbeautiful twisted features, small-eyed, with face and mouth perpetually and feverishly hungry, brutish in a catlike way, stamped to the core with degeneracy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马特没去摆弄那些钻石。他用手托着下巴坐在那儿，胳膊肘撑在桌子上，对着一堆堆闪耀的珠宝用力地眨着眼睛。他和另一个人格格不入。他不是在城市里长大的。他肌肉结实，身体多毛，论力气和长相都像个大猩猩。对他来讲，没有什么是他没见过的。他的眼睛圆圆的，间距较宽，似乎透着一种强烈的兄弟之情。这种眼神激发了信任感。可是再仔细一看就会发现，他的眼睛有点儿太圆了，两眼间的距离也有点儿太宽了。他有些过了头，失了常态，他的样貌掩盖了真实的自己。</td>
		<td class="en">Matt did not finger the diamonds.He sat with chin on hands and elbows on table, blinking heavily at the blazing array.He was in every way a contrast to the other.No city had bred him.He was heavy-muscled and hairy, gorilla-like in strength and aspect.For him there was no unseen world.His eyes were full and wide apart, and there seemed in them a certain bold brotherliness.They inspired confidence.But a closer inspection would have shown that his eyes were just a trifle too full, just a shade too wide apart.He exceeded, spilled over the limits of normality, and his features told lies about the man beneath.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这一堆得值五万。”吉姆突然说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“The bunch is worth fifty thousan’,” Jim remarked suddenly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“值十万。”马特说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“A hundred thousan’,” Matt said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >屋子里又平静下来，过了好长时间这种平静才又被他打破。</td>
		<td class="en">The silence returned and endured a long time, to be broken again by him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他到底把它们放在房子里哪儿了？——这是我想知道的。我以为他把它们都放在仓库的保险箱里了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What in hell was he coin’ with ’em all at the house?—that’s what I want to know.I’d a-thought he’d kept ’em in the safe down at the store.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马特刚还在回想被掐死的那个人的样子，就是在暗淡的灯光下最后又看了他一眼时的样子，可是提到他，马特并没有吓一跳。</td>
		<td class="en">Matt had just been considering the vision of the throttled man as he had last looked upon him in the dim light of the electric lantern; but he did not start at the mention of him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没什么可说的。”他回答道，“他可能正准备丢下自己的同伴。要不是咱们的意外出现，他早上可能要出发去什么地方。我想好人中的小偷不会比坏人里的少到哪儿去。在报纸上总能读到这样的事儿，吉姆。同伴之间总是自相残杀。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s no tellin’,” he answered.“He might a-ben gettin’ ready to chuck his pardner.He might a-pulled out in the mornin’ for parts unknown, if we hadn’t happened along.I guess there’s just as many thieves among honest men as there is among thieves.You read about such things in the papers, Jim.Pardners is always knifin’ each other.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一个人的眼神里有些奇怪和紧张。马特注意到了这点，可并没有表现出来，问道：</td>
		<td class="en">A queer, nervous look came in the other’s eyes.Matt did not betray that he noted it, though he said:—</td></tr>
