"雷神桥谜案[^1]","The Problem of Thor Bridge"
"查令十字科克斯银行[^2]的保险库里有一个满载风尘、破旧不堪的马口铁[^3]公文箱，盖子上写着我的姓名：约翰·H. 华生，医学博士，原属印度军团[^4]。箱子里面塞满了文件，绝大部分都是案卷，记录着歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生在各个时期经手的怪异问题。其中的一些案子虽然不乏趣味，结局却是彻底的失败，相关的事情既然永无定论，自然不适合形诸笔墨。没有答案的问题或许能引起研究者的兴趣，只可惜必然招致普通读者的怨声。有头无尾的故事包括詹姆斯·菲利莫尔先生的遭遇，他走回自己家里去拿雨伞，就这样从世上销声匿迹[^5]。独桅帆船“艾丽西亚号”的遭遇同样出奇，它在某个春日早晨驶入了一小团雾气，进去就没有出来，连同船上的人一起没了下文。第三个值得一提的此类故事以伊莎多拉·珀萨诺为主角，人们发现这位著名的记者兼决斗好手彻彻底底地失去了神志，直勾勾地瞪着面前的一个火柴盒，盒子里装的是一条古怪的蠕虫，据说是科学界闻所未闻的东西。抛开这些未曾破解的谜案不谈，还有些案子涉及极其重大的私家隐秘，竟至于达到了这样一种程度，一旦觉得这些案子有可能变成铅字，许多高高在上的处所就会出现惶惶不可终日的场面。不用说，像这种辜负他人信任的事情连想都不能想，眼下也已经到了把这些案子的记录挑出来销毁的时候，原因是我朋友刚好有时间，可以动手处理这件事情。剩下还有许多趣味或大或小的案子，我本来可以加工出来，可我又担心公众多食伤胃，由此损及我最为敬重的那个人的名望。有一些案子我曾经亲身参与，可以用目击证人的口吻来讲述，另一些则只能使用第三人称，因为我要么是未曾参与，要么就是参与的程度极为有限[^6]。以下这个故事则是我的亲身经历。","Somewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at Charing Cross, there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-box with my name, John H. Watson, M. D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine. Some, and not the least interesting, were complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no final explanation is forthcoming. A problem without a solution may interest the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader. Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world. No less remarkable is that of the cutter Alicia, which sailed one spring morning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged, nor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew. A third case worthy of note is that of Isadora Persano, the well-known journalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science. Apart from these unfathomed cases, there are some which involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would mean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible that they might find their way into print. I need not say that such a breach of confidence is unthinkable, and that these records will be separated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his energies to the matter. There remain a considerable residue of cases of greater or less interest which I might have edited before had I not feared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the reputation of the man whom above all others I revere. In some I was myself concerned and can speak as an eyewitness, while in others I was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person. The following narrative is drawn from my own experience."
"十月里一个风声怒号的早晨，我一边穿衣，一边看狂风吹袭后园那株孤零零的悬铃木，卷走枝头的最后一些叶子。这之后，我走到楼下去吃早餐，满以为会看到我室友郁郁不乐的模样，因为他跟所有的艺术大师一样，很容易受到环境的触动。完全出乎我意料的是，他几乎已经吃完了早餐，神情也格外地兴高采烈，身上还带着一种多少有点儿不怀好意的欢快劲头，正是他轻松时刻的常态。","It was a wild morning in October, and I observed as I was dressing how the last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane tree which graces the yard behind our house. I descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. On the contrary, I found that he had nearly finished his meal, and that his mood was particularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments."
"“手头有案子吧，福尔摩斯？”我如是说道。","“You have a case, Holmes?” I remarked."
"“演绎的本领显然是具有传染性啊，华生。”他回答道。“你也学会用演绎法来窥探我的秘密啦。没错，我手头有件案子。连着过了一个月琐碎无聊、停滞不前的日子，轮子终于又转了起来。”","“The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, Watson,” he answered. “It has enabled you to probe my secret. Yes, I have a case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more.”"
"“能给我讲讲吗？”","“Might I share it?”"
"“可讲的事情虽然不多，咱们倒不妨讨论一下，不过你得先吃完那两只鸡蛋。那两只鸡蛋是咱们的新厨子赏给咱们的，煮得梆硬，它们的火候多半跟我昨天在门厅桌子上看到的那本《家庭信使》[^7]不无关系。即便是应付煮鸡蛋这样的琐碎事情，你也得拿出一种准确把握时间的专注，与此同时，这样的专注是跟那本绝妙期刊里的言情故事水火不容的。”","“There is little to share, but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hard-boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us. Their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the Family Herald which I observed yesterday upon the hall-table. Even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time and incompatible with the love romance in that excellent periodical.”"
"一刻钟之后，桌子已经收拾干净，我俩面对面地坐在了一起，他手里拿着从衣兜里掏出来的一封信。","A quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face to face. He had drawn a letter from his pocket."
"“你听说过金矿大王尼尔·吉布森吗？”他问道。","“You have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold King?” he said."
"“你是说那个美国参议员吗？”","“You mean the American Senator?”"
"“没错，他一度是美国西部某个州的参议员，可他之所以出名，主要是因为他是世界上最大的金矿巨头。”","“Well, he was once Senator for some Western state, but is better known as the greatest gold-mining magnate in the world.”"
"“是的，我知道他。他来英国不是有些日子了嘛，他的名字我听着非常耳熟。”","“Yes, I know of him. He has surely lived in England for some time. His name is very familiar.”"
"“没错，大概五年之前，他在汉普郡[^8]置下了一大片产业。他妻子惨遭横祸，兴许你已经听说了吧？”","“Yes, he bought a considerable estate in Hampshire some five years ago. Possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?”"
"“那是当然，你一说我就想起来了。就是因为这件事情，我才会觉得他的名字耳熟。不过，其中的细节我确实是一无所知。”","“Of course. I remember it now. That is why the name is familiar. But I really know nothing of the details.”"
"福尔摩斯冲着椅子上的一堆报纸挥了挥手。“我完全没想到这件案子会到我的手里，不然的话，我肯定是一早就把资料准备好啦。”他说道。“事实上，这件案子虽然极其轰动，看上去却没有什么疑难之处。被告的个性虽然迷人，终归也不能抹杀确凿的罪证。验尸官陪审团就是这种看法，地方法庭也是这种结论。到这会儿，案子已经转到了温切斯特的巡回法庭[^9]。照我看，这恐怕是一件费力不讨好的活计。我有本事发现事实，华生，可我没本事改变事实。除非是有了什么意想不到的全新发现，如其不然，我这个主顾是没什么盼头的。”","Holmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair. “I had no idea that the case was coming my way or I should have had my extracts ready,” said he. “The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. The interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence. That was the view taken by the coroner’s jury and also in the police-court proceedings. It is now referred to the Assizes at Winchester. I fear it is a thankless business. I can discover facts, Watson, but I cannot change them. Unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope for.”"
"“你的主顾？”","“Your client?”"
"“哦，我倒是忘了，这件事情我还没跟你说呢。华生啊，我也染上了你那种莫名其妙的怪毛病，学会把故事倒过来讲啦。好了，你还是先读一读这个吧。”","“Ah, I forgot I had not told you. I am getting into your involved habit, Watson, of telling the story backward. You had best read this first.”"
"他把一封信递给了我，信上的笔迹清晰醒目，咄咄逼人，全文如下：","The letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand, ran as follows:"
"> 克拉里奇酒店，","> CLARRIDGE’S HOTEL, "
"> 十月三日","> *October* 3 *rd*."
"> 亲爱的歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生：","> Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:"
"> 我不能眼睁睁看着古往今来最好的女人走向死亡，一定要尽一切的努力来挽救她。我解释不了这些事情，哪怕是试着解释一下都做不到，可我确切无疑地知道，邓巴小姐是无辜的。相关的事实您肯定已经知道了——谁不知道呢？这已经成了举国上下的谈资。可是，没有一个人站出来替她说话！就是这种全无公道的该死局面把我逼到了疯狂的边缘。这个女人心软得连苍蝇都不忍伤害啊。这样吧，我明天十一点钟过去找您，看您能不能从黑暗之中找出一点光明。说不定，我手里还有什么我自个儿都不知道的线索呢。不管怎么样，我所知的一切、我所有的一切，再加上我整个儿的人，全部都听您差遣，只要您能救她就行。如果您确实拥有那些神奇的本领，那就把它们全部用到这件案子上吧。","> I can’t see the best woman God ever made go to her death without doing all that is possible to save her. I can’t explain things—I can’t even try to explain them, but I know beyond all doubt that Miss Dunbar is innocent. You know the facts—who doesn’t? It has been the gossip of the country. And never a voice raised for her! It’s the damned injustice of it all that makes me crazy. That woman has a heart that wouldn’t let her kill a fly. Well, I’ll come at eleven tomorrow and see if you can get some ray of light in the dark. Maybe I have a clue and don’t know it. Anyhow, all I know and all I have and all I am are for your use if only you can save her. If ever in your life you showed your powers, put them now into this case."
"> 您忠实的朋友","> Yours faithfully,"
"> J.尼尔·吉布森","> J. Neil Gibson."
"“看到了吧。”歇洛克·福尔摩斯一边说，一边抖掉他那斗饭后烟草的灰烬，然后又慢条斯理地往烟斗里添烟草。“我等的就是这位先生。至于这件事情嘛，我看你已经来不及读完所有这些报纸啦，如果你对案情产生了探究兴趣的话，我只能简要地给你介绍一下。这个人是世界上最有势力的财阀，据我所知还是个性情极其凶暴、极其可怕的家伙。这次惨案的受害人就是他的妻子，可我对他妻子一无所知，只知道她已经过了盛年，让局面雪上加霜的是，她那两个年幼孩子的家庭教师是一个非常有魅力的女人。案子的主角就是这三个人，案发地点则是一座富丽堂皇的古老府第，那里曾经是一个英格兰古国的政治中心。再来说惨案本身，深夜时分，人们在庭园里发现了他的妻子，那地方离宅子差不多有半英里。他妻子穿着晚装，搭着披肩，一颗左轮手枪子弹打穿了她的脑子。尸体周围没有武器，也没有关于这次凶案的任何线索。尸体周围没有武器，华生——记住这一点！凶案似乎是在入夜时分发生的，等到十一点钟左右，一名猎场看守发现了尸体，警察和医生随即对尸体进行了检查，之后才把尸体抬进宅子。我讲得是不是有点儿过于精简啊，你都听明白了吗？”","“There you have it,” said Sherlock Holmes, knocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it. “That is the gentleman I await. As to the story, you have hardly time to master all these papers, so I must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings. This man is the greatest financial power in the world, and a man, as I understand, of most violent and formidable character. He married a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom I know nothing save that she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children. These are the three people concerned, and the scene is a grand old manor house, the centre of a historical English state. Then as to the tragedy. The wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain. No weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder. No weapon near her, Watson—mark that! The crime seems to have been committed late in the evening, and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven o’clock, when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house. Is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?”"
"“你讲得非常清楚，不过，他们为什么要怀疑这个家庭教师呢？”","“It is all very clear. But why suspect the governess?”"
"“这个嘛，首先是因为他们找到了一些非常直接的证据。他们在家庭教师那里找到了一把开过一枪的左轮手枪，口径跟尸身上的子弹相符，手枪就摆在她那个衣橱的底板上。”说到这里，他突然双眼发直，一字一顿地把刚才的话重复了一遍，“就——摆在——她——那个衣橱——的——底板上。”接下来，他陷入了沉默，我看得出他脑子里的思维列车已经启动，自然不会去干打搅他的蠢事。突然之间，他猛一激灵，恢复了先前那种兴致勃勃的状态。“没错，华生，他们找到了手枪。铁板钉钉，对吧？那两个陪审团反正是这么想的。然后呢，死了的这个女人手里有一张字条，字条表明有人跟她约在了死亡地点，末尾署的是家庭教师的名字。你觉得怎么样？最后，家庭教师确实有作案的动机。吉布森参议员是个很有吸引力的人物，种种迹象都表明他对家庭教师非常上心，如果他妻子死了的话，还有谁会比这位年青女士更有可能接替他妻子的位置呢？爱情、金钱、权势，一切都取决于一个中年女人的性命。丑陋啊，华生——丑陋之极！”","“Well, in the first place there is some very direct evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe.” His eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words, “On—the—floor—of—her—wardrobe.” Then he sank into silence, and I saw that some train of thought had been set moving which I should be foolish to interrupt. Suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life once more. “Yes, Watson, it was found. Pretty damning, eh? So the two juries thought. Then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess. How’s that? Finally there is the motive. Senator Gibson is an attractive person. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer? Love, fortune, power, all depending upon one middle-aged life. Ugly, Watson—very ugly!”"
"“是啊，确实丑陋，福尔摩斯。”","“Yes, indeed, Holmes.”"
"“此外，家庭教师拿不出不在现场的证明。恰恰相反，她不得不承认，差不多就在惨案发生的那个时间，她确实是在雷神桥——也就是惨案现场——附近。这一点不容抵赖，因为一个路过的村民看见了她在那里。”","“Nor could she prove an alibi. On the contrary, she had to admit that she was down near Thor Bridge—that was the scene of the tragedy—about that hour. She couldn’t deny it, for some passing villager had seen her there.”"
"“看样子，这真的是一件铁案啊。”","“That really seems final.”"
"“然而，华生——然而！雷神桥是一座宽阔的石桥，两边都有栏杆。这座桥连着马车道，桥下是一个又长又深的苇塘，名字叫做‘雷神塘’。石桥从苇塘最狭窄的部位跨过，死了的这个女人就在桥头躺着。主要的事实就是这些。好了，我没搞错的话，咱们的主顾已经来了，时间提前了很多啊。”","“And yet, Watson—and yet! This bridge—a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides—carries the drive over the narrowest part of a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. Thor Mere it is called. In the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman. Such are the main facts. But here, if I mistake not, is our client, considerably before his time.”"
"比利[^10]已经推开了房门，通报的姓名却出乎我们的意料。来的是马洛·贝茨先生，我们两个都不认识。他瘦骨伶仃，诚惶诚恐，眼睛里惊魂未定，整个人抖抖索索，战战兢兢。以我的专业眼光来看，这个人已经走到了神经彻底崩溃的边缘。","Billy had opened the door, but the name which he announced was an unexpected one. Mr. Marlow Bates was a stranger to both of us. He was a thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes and a twitching, hesitating manner—a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown."
"“您好像有点儿激动啊，贝茨先生。”福尔摩斯说道。“请坐。恐怕我给不了您多少时间，因为我十一点钟有个约会。”","“You seem agitated, Mr. Bates,” said Holmes. “Pray sit down. I fear I can only give you a short time, for I have an appointment at eleven.”"
"“我知道，”我们的客人倒吸一口凉气，嘴里迸出一连串短短的句子，就跟喘不上气似的，“吉布森先生要上这儿来。吉布森先生是我的东家。我是他的庄园管事。福尔摩斯先生，他是个恶棍——是个地狱里来的恶棍。 ”","“I know you have,” our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences like a man who is out of breath, “Mr. Gibson is coming. Mr. Gibson is my employer. I am manager of his estate. Mr. Holmes, he is a villain—an infernal villain.”"
"“您的措辞很激烈啊，贝茨先生。”","“Strong language, Mr. Bates.”"
"“我不得不加重语气，福尔摩斯先生，因为我的时间实在有限。我死也不能让他看到我来了这儿，而他很快就要来了。可我赶得不巧，想早来也办不到。今天早上，他的秘书弗格森先生才告诉我，吉布森先生跟您有约。”","“I have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the time is so limited. I would not have him find me here for the world. He is almost due now. But I was so situated that I could not come earlier. His secretary, Mr. Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you.”"
"“您不是他的管事吗？”","“And you are his manager?”"
"“我已经跟他提出辞职了。用不了两个星期，我就能摆脱他那种该死的奴役。他是个冷酷的人，福尔摩斯先生，对身边所有的人都冷酷。他那些公开的善举不过是一块遮羞布，为的是掩盖他私底下的罪孽。当然喽，首当其冲的还是他的妻子。他对待妻子的方式惨无人道——真的，先生，惨无人道！他妻子是怎么死的我不知道，可我确切地知道，他把她的生活变成了痛苦的深渊。他妻子是热带地方的人，出生在巴西，这您肯定知道吧。”","“I have given him notice. In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken off his accursed slavery. A hard man, Mr. Holmes, hard to all about him. Those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities. But his wife was his chief victim. He was brutal to her—yes, sir, brutal! How she came by her death I do not know, but I am sure that he had made her life a misery to her. She was a creature of the tropics, a Brazilian by birth, as no doubt you know.”"
"“不知道，这我倒没留意。”","“No, it had escaped me.”"
"“热带出身，热带性情，她是个艳阳哺育的火辣女子。她把她这类女人的火辣深情全部倾注在了丈夫身上，结果呢，等到她的美貌——我听人说，她曾经貌美惊人——消褪之后，丈夫就彻底丧失了对她的兴趣。大家都喜欢她，同情她，都为她丈夫对待她的方式感到义愤填膺。不过，她丈夫可是个能说会道、诡计多端的家伙。我要说的就是这些。您不要光看他的表面，里头的东西还多着呢。好了，我得走了。别，别，别拦着我！他马上就要来啦。”","“Tropical by birth and tropical by nature. A child of the sun and of passion. She had loved him as such women can love, but when her own physical charms had faded—I am told that they once were great—there was nothing to hold him. We all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her. But he is plausible and cunning. That is all I have to say to you. Don’t take him at his face value. There is more behind. Now I’ll go. No, no, don’t detain me! He is almost due.”"
"这位奇异的客人惊慌失措地看了看钟，实实在在地跑了起来，转眼就消失在了门外。","With a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared."
"“好啊！好啊！”片刻沉默之后，福尔摩斯说道。“看样子，吉布森先生的家里人还挺拥护他的哩。不过，这个人的警告还是有点儿用处的。好啦，等他本人来了再说吧。”","“Well! Well!” said Holmes after an interval of silence. “Mr. Gibson seems to have a nice loyal household. But the warning is a useful one, and now we can only wait till the man himself appears.”"
"十一点整，楼梯上传来了沉重的脚步声，比利把这位著名的富豪领进了房间。看到他的模样，我不光懂得了他那个管事的恐惧和厌恶，还懂得了无数个商场对手堆在他脑袋上的那些诅咒。如果我是个雕塑家，打算塑造一个心如铁石、寡廉鲜耻的成功商人，尼尔·吉布森先生就是最合适的模特。他那副又高又瘦、骨架嶙峋的身板诉说着饥渴与贪婪。把亚伯拉罕·林肯身上的高贵替换成卑污，你就可以大致想见他的模样。他的脸就跟用花岗岩凿出来的一样，坚硬刻板，崎岖不平，冷酷无情，一道道深深的沟壑见证着他人生之中的无数个危难时刻。他猬毛一般的浓眉之下是一双冷漠的灰色眼睛，正在用老谋深算的目光来回打量我们。福尔摩斯介绍我的时候，他马马虎虎地欠了欠身，跟着就摆出一副飞扬跋扈的主子架势，把一把椅子拖到我室友面前，自顾自地坐了下来，皮包骨头的膝盖几乎顶到了我室友的身上。","Sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs, and the famous millionaire was shown into the room. As I looked upon him I understood not only the fears and dislike of his manager but also the execrations which so many business rivals have heaped upon his head. If I were a sculptor and desired to idealize the successful man of affairs, iron of nerve and leathery of conscience, I should choose Mr. Neil Gibson as my model. His tall, gaunt, craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and rapacity. An Abraham Lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man. His face might have been chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless, with deep lines upon it, the sears of many a crisis. Cold gray eyes, looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn. He bowed in perfunctory fashion as Holmes mentioned my name, and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him."
"“我直接说了吧，福尔摩斯先生。”他张嘴就说，“办这件案子我绝不计较花费。只要能照亮您通往真相的道路，您尽管把钞票当成生火的燃料。这个女人清白无辜，这个女人必须得到洗雪，这件事情得靠您来办。说个数吧！”","“Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes,” he began, “that money is nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it’s any use in lighting you to the truth. This woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared, and it’s up to you to do it. Name your figure!”"
"“我的业务费用有一套固定的标准。”福尔摩斯冷冷地说道。“完全免费的情形倒是有，收费的标准是不会变的。”","“My professional charges are upon a fixed scale,” said Holmes coldly. “I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.”"
"“呃，不在乎钱的话，那您就想想由此而来的声望吧。只要您办成了这件事情，英美两国的所有报纸都会把您往天上捧。两个大洲的人都会把您挂在嘴上的。”","“Well, if dollars make no difference to you, think of the reputation. If you pull this off every paper in England and America will be booming you. You’ll be the talk of two continents.”"
"“谢谢您，吉布森先生，我并不觉得我需要吹捧。说出来您可能会觉得惊讶，可我喜欢隐姓埋名地工作，兴趣所在仅仅是问题本身。算啦，说这些完全是浪费时间，咱们还是来说说案情吧。”","“Thank you, Mr. Gibson, I do not think that I am in need of booming. It may surprise you to know that I prefer to work anonymously, and that it is the problem itself which attracts me. But we are wasting time. Let us get down to the facts.”"
"“依我看，主要的案情都已经上了报，我真不知道我还能补充什么有用的东西。不过，如果您有什么地方需要弄得更明白的话——瞧，我这不是来了嘛。”","“I think that you will find all the main ones in the press reports. I don’t know that I can add anything which will help you. But if there is anything you would wish more light upon— well, I am here to give it.”"
"“很好，我要问的只有一点。”","“Well, there is just one point.”"
"“哪一点？”","“What is it?”"
"“确切地说，您和邓巴小姐究竟是什么关系？”","“What were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?”"
"金矿大王浑身一震，身子从椅子上起了一半。接下来，他恢复了先前那种泰然自若的神态。","The Gold King gave a violent start and half rose from his chair. Then his massive calm came back to him."
"“照我看，问这样的问题是您的权利，甚至可以说是您的职责，福尔摩斯先生。”","“I suppose you are within your rights—and maybe doing your duty—in asking such a question, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“您这个看法我同意。”福尔摩斯说道。","“We will agree to suppose so,” said Holmes."
"“那我可以向您保证，我和邓巴小姐之间的关系纯粹是也始终是一个东家和一个受聘的年青女士之间的关系，女士没有和东家的孩子待在一起的时候，东家从来没跟女士说过话，甚至从来没有见过她。”","“Then I can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, save when she was in the company of his children.”"
"福尔摩斯起身离座。","Holmes rose from his chair."
"“我这个人事情很多，吉布森先生。”他说道，“没工夫也没兴趣进行不着边际的谈话。再见。”","“I am a rather busy man, Mr. Gibson,” said he, “and I have no time or taste for aimless conversations. I wish you good-morning.”"
"客人也已经站了起来，骨架松散的魁梧身形比福尔摩斯还要高上一头，猬毛一般的浓眉之下射出了两道愤怒的寒光，蜡黄的双颊泛起了一抹鲜艳的颜色。","Our visitor had risen also, and his great loose figure towered above Holmes. There was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks."
"“这话到底是什么意思，福尔摩斯先生？您是要推掉我的案子吗？”","“What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes? Do you dismiss my case?”"
"“呃，吉布森先生，案子先不说，您这个人我是要推掉的。依我看，我已经说得够明白的啦。”","“Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I should have thought my words were plain.”"
"“是挺明白的，可我倒想知道，您心里打的是什么算盘？是坐地起价，是知难而退，还是另有图谋呢？我有权得到一个明明白白的回答。”","“Plain enough, but what’s at the back of it? Raising the price on me, or afraid to tackle it, or what? I’ve a right to a plain answer.”"
"“是吗，兴许您确实有这个权利，”福尔摩斯说道。“那我就给您一个回答吧。这件案子本来就已经够复杂的啦，用不着再弄些假情报来添乱。”","“Well, perhaps you have,” said Holmes. “I’ll give you one. This case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information.”"
"“意思是我说了谎。”","“Meaning that I lie.”"
"“呃，我一直都在尽量把话往委婉里说，不过，您要是非用这个字眼儿不可的话，我也不会反驳您的。”","“Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not contradict you.”"
"我一下子跳了起来，因为这位富豪的表情已经变得跟恶魔一样狰狞，那只骨节嶙峋的硕大拳头也已经举到了空中。福尔摩斯懒洋洋地笑了笑，伸手去拿自己的烟斗。","I sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire’s face was fiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted fist. Holmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe."
"“少安毋躁，吉布森先生。根据我的经验，刚吃完早饭的时候，就算是最轻微的口角也非常影响情绪。我看您不如出去走走，呼吸呼吸晨间的空气，安安静静地想一想，肯定会受益匪浅的。”","“Don’t be noisy, Mr. Gibson. I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.”"
"金矿大王勉强压住了心里的火气。片刻之间，无比强大的自制力就把他从一团熊熊燃烧的怒火变成了一座倨傲漠然的冰山，真叫我不得不佩服。","With an effort the Gold King mastered his fury. I could not but admire him, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference."
"“好吧，悉听尊便。按我看，您对自个儿的业务很有主见，我也不能勉强您接下您不愿意接的案子。今天早上的事情对您没什么好处，福尔摩斯先生，比您还难对付的人我也收拾过。跟我作对的人都没有占到什么便宜。”","“Well, it’s your choice. I guess you know how to run your own business. I can’t make you touch the case against your will. You’ve done yourself no good this morning, Mr. Holmes, for I have broken stronger men than you. No man ever crossed me and was the better for it.”"
"“好多人都像您这么说过，可我不还是这样嘛。”福尔摩斯笑着说道。“好啦，再见，吉布森先生。您需要学习的东西还多着呢。”","“So many have said so, and yet here I am,” said Holmes, smiling. “Well, good morning, Mr. Gibson. You have a good deal yet to learn.”"
"客人山呼海啸地退了场，福尔摩斯却好像没有听见，只是默默地抽着烟，出神地望着天花板。","Our visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling."
"“有何高见，华生？”他终于开口发问。","“Any views, Watson?” he asked at last."
"“呃，福尔摩斯，说老实话，鉴于他显然是个容不得任何绊脚石的人，而我还记得，那个名叫贝茨的人说得非常明白，他妻子没准儿就是一块不受他待见的绊脚石，所以我觉得——”","“Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I consider that this is a man who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me—”"
"“没错，我也这么觉得。”","“Exactly. And to me also.”"
"“不过，他跟那个家庭教师究竟是什么关系，你又是怎么看出来的呢？”","“But what were his relations with the governess, and how did you discover them?”"
"“诈唬，华生，靠的是诈唬！看到他信里那种激情洋溢、不合常规的私事口吻，再跟他本人那种自制内敛的神情举止作个对比，显而易见，这件事让他很是动情，动情还不是为了受害人，反倒是为了那个受到指控的女人。要想查明真相，咱们就必须弄清他们三个之间的确切关系。你看见了我向他发起的正面进攻，也看见了他是多么地应付裕如。所以我只好诈他，让他觉得我确定无疑地掌握了他俩之间的关系，实际呢，我只是非常怀疑而已。”","“Bluff, Watson, bluff! When I considered the passionate, unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of his letter and contrasted it with his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim. We’ve got to understand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth. You saw the frontal attack which I made upon him, and how imperturbably he received it. Then I bluffed him by giving him the impression that I was absolutely certain, when in reality I was only extremely suspicious.”"
"“没准儿他还会回来吧？”","“Perhaps he will come back?”"
"“他肯定会回来，不得不回来，因为他不能就这么撒手不管。哈！是门铃的声音吗？没错，我听到他的脚步声了。好啦，吉布森先生，刚才我还在跟华生医生说，您怎么还没回来啊。”","“He is sure to come back. He *must*come back. He can’t leave it where it is. Ha! isn’t that a ring? Yes, there is his footstep. Well, Mr. Gibson, I was just saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat overdue.”"
"金矿大王已经再次走进了房间，态度比离开的时候老实了一些。他的眼睛里仍然带着那种颜面受损的懊恨，可他的常识理性已经让他明白，要想达到目的，不妥协是不行的。","The Gold King had reentered the room in a more chastened mood than he had left it. His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes, but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain his end."
"“我一直在掂量这件事情，福尔摩斯先生，结论是您的话不无道理，我的火气未免有点儿草率。您确实应该探明事实，任何事实都不例外，您这么做，我倒是对您更加敬重。不过我可以跟您保证，我和邓巴小姐的关系对这件案子没有什么影响。”","“I’ve been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that I have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss. You are justified in getting down to the facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more of you for it. I can assure you, however, that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me don’t really touch this case.”"
"“有没有影响得是我说了算，对吧？”","“That is for me to decide, is it not?”"
"“对，我同意您的看法。您好比是一位医生，一定要看清所有的症状才能下诊断。”","“Yes, I guess that is so. You’re like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis.”"
"“没错，这个比喻非常贴切。还有啊，病人如果向医生隐瞒症状，那就肯定是另有目的。”","“Exactly. That expresses it. And it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case.”"
"“兴许是吧，可您必须承认，福尔摩斯先生，如果有人直截了当地问起自己跟某个女人的关系，大多数男人都会有点儿躲躲闪闪，如果他确实对这个女人动了真情的话。要我说，大多数男人的心灵深处都有一小块只属于自己的私人领地，不欢迎别人跑来窥探。您倒好，突然之间就闯了进来。话又说回来，您这么做只是为了救她，所以也情有可原。好吧，围栏已经撤除，私人领地已经开放，您想看哪儿就看哪儿吧。您想知道什么呢？”","“That may be so, but you will admit, Mr. Holmes, that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked point-blank what their relations with a woman may be—if there is really some serious feeling in the case. I guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they don’t welcome intruders. And you burst suddenly into it. But the object excuses you, since it was to try and save her. Well, the stakes are down and the reserve open, and you can explore where you will. What is it you want?”"
"“真相。”","“The truth.”"
"金矿大王沉默了片刻，似乎是正在整理自己的思绪。这时候，他那张沟壑纵横的严峻面孔已经变得更加悲哀、更加阴沉。","The Gold King paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts. His grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave."
"“真相几句话就可以说完，福尔摩斯先生。”他终于开了口。“有些事情不好讲，讲起来也让人痛苦，所以我只会讲到必要的程度，不会再往深里讲。在巴西淘金的时候，我认识了我的妻子。她闺名玛丽亚·平托，是马瑙斯一位政府官员的女儿，长得非常漂亮。那时我很年轻，脑子里充满了激情，不过，即便到了现在，拿一种更加冷静、更加挑剔的眼光回头去看，我仍然觉得当时的她是一个少有的美人。除此之外，吸引我的还有她那种深沉饱满的性情，她敢爱敢恨，全心全意，热情奔放，行事冲动，跟我在美国见到的那些女人大不相同。长话短说吧，我爱上了她，后来又娶了她。等到当初的浪漫激情——那样的激情持续了好些年——消退之后，我才认识到我俩之间没有共同点，一丁点儿都没有。这么着，我对她的爱由浓转淡。如果她的爱也淡了的话，事情倒还好办，可您肯定知道，女人就是这么奇妙！不管我怎么做，她始终不肯疏远我。即便我对她冷酷无情，按有些人的说法还达到了惨无人道的地步，那也只是因为我知道，如果能扑灭她的爱，或者是让她由爱转恨，我们两个都会好过一些。可是，什么事情也不能改变她的心意。身处英格兰的山林之中，她对我的爱依然跟二十年前在亚马逊河岸的时候一模一样。随便我怎么做，她始终对我死心塌地。","“I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr. Holmes,” said he at last. “There are some things that are painful as well as difficult to say, so I won’t go deeper than is needful. I met my wife when I was gold-hunting in Brazil. Maria Pinto was the daughter of a government official at Manaos, and she was very beautiful. I was young and ardent in those days, but even now, as I look back with colder blood and a more critical eye, I can see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty. It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-hearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from the American women whom I had known. Well, to make a long story short, I loved her and I married her. It was only when the romance had passed—and it lingered for years—that I realized that we had nothing—absolutely nothing—in common. My love faded. If hers had faded also it might have been easier. But you know the wonderful way of women! Do what I might, nothing could turn her from me. If I have been harsh to her, even brutal as some have said, it has been because I knew that if I could kill her love, or if it turned to hate, it would be easier for both of us. But nothing changed her. She adored me in those English woods as she had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the Amazon. Do what I might, she was as devoted as ever."
"“然后呢，格蕾丝·邓巴小姐来了。她来应征我们登的启事，然后就成了我们那两个孩子的家庭教师。报纸上有她的相片，您兴许已经看见了。所有的人都承认，她也是一个非常漂亮的女人。好啦，我并不打算装出一副比别人高尚的样子。我这就跟您坦白，天天跟这样的一个女人待在同一个屋檐下，我不可能不对她产生强烈的感情。这有什么不对吗，福尔摩斯先生？”","“Then came Miss Grace Dunbar. She answered our advertisement and became governess to our two children. Perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers. The whole world has proclaimed that she also is a very beautiful woman. Now, I make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her. Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“我倒不觉得您这种感情有什么不对，可您要是把它表白出来的话，那可就不应该了，因为这位年青的女士在一定程度上是托庇于您的。”","“I do not blame you for feeling it. I should blame you if you expressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your protection.”"
"“呃，兴许是吧。”富豪应了一句，只不过，福尔摩斯的谴责还是让愤怒的光芒再一次从他眼里一闪而过。“我没打算往自个儿脸上贴金。要我说，我一辈子都是个想要什么就伸手去拿的人，而我最想要的就是这个女人的爱，还有她这个人。我照直跟她说了。”","“Well, maybe so,” said the millionaire, though for a moment the reproof had brought the old angry gleam into his eyes. “I’m not pretending to be any better than I am. I guess all my life I’ve been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted, and I never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman. I told her so.”"
"“哦，您说了啊，真的吗？”","“Oh, you did, did you?”"
"真生起气来的时候，福尔摩斯的样子是非常可怕的。","Holmes could look very formidable when he was moved."
"“我跟她说，能娶她的话我一定会娶，只可惜我办不到。我还告诉她，钱不是问题，只要能让她过得舒心惬意，我不会吝惜任何东西。”","“I said to her that if I could marry her I would, but that it was out of my power. I said that money was no object and that all I could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done.”"
"“不用说，您真是慷慨极啦。”福尔摩斯冷笑一声。","“Very generous, I am sure,” said Holmes with a sneer."
"“听着，福尔摩斯先生，我找您是为了澄清事实，并不是为了跟您探讨道德问题。我不需要您对我指手划脚。”","“See here, Mr. Holmes. I came to you on a question of evidence, not on a question of morals. I’m not asking for your criticism.”"
"“完全是看在这位年青女士的分上，我才会碰您这件案子。”福尔摩斯厉声说道。“按我看，她身上的所有罪名都坏不过您自承不讳的那条罪名，因为您竟然打算毁掉一个托庇于您的无助姑娘。你们这样的富人真应该受到一点儿教训，好让你们知道，并不是整个世界都会接受你们的贿赂，对你们的罪恶不闻不问。”","“It is only for the young lady’s sake that I touch your case at all,” said Holmes sternly. “I don’t know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof. Some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences.”"
"出乎我意料的是，金矿大王竟然老老实实地收下了这通训斥。","To my surprise the Gold King took the reproof with equanimity."
"“到这会儿，我自个儿也是这么想的。谢天谢地，我的计划没有收到我预期的效果。她根本不听我说的那些话，还打算立刻离开我的宅子。”","“That’s how I feel myself about it now. I thank God that my plans did not work out as I intended. She would have none of it, and she wanted to leave the house instantly.”"
"“她为什么没有离开呢？”","“Why did she not?”"
"“呃，这首先是因为她得养活她的亲人，她不能随随便便地自断生计，让她的亲人陷入困境。等我发誓保证——我确实发了誓——再也不骚扰她之后，她也就接受了我的挽留。不过，这当中还有另外的原因。她心里明白，她对我的影响力超过了世上的任何一种力量，所以就想利用这种影响力来做点好事。”","“Well, in the first place, others were dependent upon her, and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living. When I had sworn—as I did—that she should never be molested again, she consented to remain. But there was another reason. She knew the influence she had over me, and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world. She wanted to use it for good.”"
"“怎么做呢？”","“How?”"
"“这个嘛，她对我的生意略有所知。我的生意做得很大，福尔摩斯先生，大得超出了普通人的想象。我掌握着兴造与摧毁的力量，不过我通常都是摧毁。毁在我手里的不光是单个的人，还有一个又一个的群体、一个又一个的城市，甚至是一个又一个的国家。生意是一种冷血的游戏，弱者只能承受失败的结局。我全力以赴地玩着这种游戏，自己从来不叫痛，也从来不管别人叫不叫痛。不过，她的看法跟我不一样，我也觉得她的看法不无道理。她心口如一地认为，一个人的多余财富绝不能建筑在千万人生活无着的基础之上。她的看法就是这样，按我的感觉，她能够看到某种比财富更加持久的东西。她发现我肯听她的话，所以相信自己可以通过影响我的行动来造福世人。这么着，她留了下来，然后就出了这件事情。”","“Well, she knew something of my affairs. They are large, Mr. Holmes—large beyond the belief of an ordinary man. I can make or break—and it is usually break. It wasn’t individuals only. It was communities, cities, even nations. Business is a hard game, and the weak go to the wall. I played the game for all it was worth. I never squealed myself, and I never cared if the other fellow squealed. But she saw it different. I guess she was right. She believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life. That was how she saw it, and I guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting. She found that I listened to what she said, and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions. So she stayed—and then this came along.”"
"“您自个儿有没有什么头绪呢？”","“Can you throw any light upon that?”"
"金矿大王没有立刻回答，而是用双手捂住脑袋，沉思了一两分钟。","The Gold King paused for a minute or more, his head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought."
"“局面确实对她非常不利，这一点我绝不否认。再者说，女人的心思深藏不露，往往会做出让男人没法预料的事情。刚刚出事的时候，我惊得慌了神，以至于愿意相信她确实是受了什么匪夷所思的蛊惑，做出了这种完全违背本性的事情。后来呢，我想到了这么一种解释，不管它讲不讲得通，我还是说给您听一听。我妻子非常妒忌她，这是件毫无疑问的事情。对精神关系的妒忌也可以非常疯狂，不逊于对身体关系的妒忌。虽说我妻子没有理由产生后一种妒忌——照我看，她自己也明白这一点——可她确实知道，这个英国姑娘可以在很大程度上影响我的想法和行动，而她自己从来不曾拥有这样的力量。尽管这是一种好的影响，事情也没有任何改观。仇恨把她逼到了疯狂的边缘，她的血液里又始终流淌着亚马逊河的刚烈性情。当时的情形兴许是这样的，她想要谋杀邓巴小姐，要不就是拿枪威胁邓巴小姐离开我们家。然后呢，她们两个扭打起来，枪走了火，中枪的正好是拿着枪的那一个。”","“It’s very black against her. I can’t deny that. And women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man. At first I was so rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature. One explanation came into my head. I give it to you, Mr. Holmes, for what it is worth. There is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause—and I think she understood this—for the latter, she was aware that this English girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had. It was an influence for good, but that did not mend the matter. She was crazy with hatred, and the heat of the Amazon was always in her blood. She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar—or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us. Then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it.”"
"“这种可能性我已经想到了。”福尔摩斯说道。“说实在的，这是唯一的一种可以替代蓄意谋杀的明显解释。”","“That possibility had already occurred to me,” said Holmes. “Indeed, it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.”"
"“可是，邓巴小姐彻底否认这种解释。”","“But she utterly denies it.”"
"“这个嘛，她的否认并不能成为定论，对吧？可想而知，一个女人陷入了如此可怕的处境，完全可能惊慌失措地拿着枪跑回家里，甚至还可能把枪扔进自己的衣橱，压根儿没有意识到自己在干什么。等到事情败露的时候，她也完全可能来个一概不认，用谎言来给自己开脱，因为其他的说辞都帮不上忙。您能拿什么来推翻这样的假设呢？”","“Well, that is not final—is it? One can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver. She might even throw it down among her clothes, hardly knowing what she was doing, and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial, since all explanation was impossible. What is against such a supposition?”"
"“邓巴小姐的人品。”","“Miss Dunbar herself.”"
"“是吗，也许吧。”","“Well, perhaps.”"
"福尔摩斯看了看表。“我敢肯定，我们今天上午就可以拿到必要的许可[^12]，然后就可以坐晚班火车去温切斯特。见到这位年青女士之后，我多半可以更好地替您出力，不过我不能保证，我的结论一定会符合您的心意。”","Holmes looked at his watch. “I have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach Winchester by the evening train. When I have seen this young lady it is very possible that I may be of more use to you in the matter, though I cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire.”"
"官方的手续出现了一些延误，结果呢，当天我们并没有直接赶往温切斯特，而是先去了一趟雷神府邸，也就是尼尔·吉布森先生在汉普郡置下的那片产业。吉布森先生没有亲自作陪，只是把考文垂警长的地址给了我们。考文垂警长来自当地的警局，是这件案子的第一个经手人。他身材瘦高、面无血色，老是摆着一副神神秘秘的架势，让人觉得他知道或者猜到的事情还有很多很多，只是不敢说出来而已。他还有一种怪癖，那就是突然把嗓门儿压到耳语那么低，似乎是有了什么天大的发现，说出来的却往往只是一些再平常不过的事情。另一方面，我们很快就发现，他外在的举止虽然怪异，骨子里却是个正派诚实的伙计，态度也比较谦逊，能够坦然承认自己束手无策，需要别人的帮助。","There was some delay in the official pass, and instead of reaching Winchester that day we went down to Thor Place, the Hampshire estate of Mr. Neil Gibson. He did not accompany us himself, but we had the address of Sergeant Coventry, of the local police, who had first examined into the affair. He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a secretive and mysterious manner which conveyed the idea that he knew or suspected a very great deal more than he dared say. He had a trick, too, of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon something of vital importance, though the information was usually commonplace enough. Behind these tricks of manner he soon showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help."
"“不管怎么样，福尔摩斯先生，您来了总比苏格兰场来人要好，”他如是说道。“苏格兰场来了人的话，本地的警察就只有背黑锅的份儿，什么功劳也别想分到。您不一样，我听说您办事是非常公道的。”","“Anyhow, I’d rather have you than Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “If the Yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure. Now, you play straight, so I’ve heard.”"
"“我压根儿就不需要在这件案子当中露脸。”福尔摩斯说道，我们这位愁眉苦脸的新相识立刻露出了宽慰的表情。“如果我破了案，你们也不需要提我的名字。”","“I need not appear in the matter at all,” said Holmes to the evident relief of our melancholy acquaintance. “If I can clear it up I don’t ask to have my name mentioned.”"
"“呃，说实在的，您的肚量可真大。我还知道，您的朋友华生医生也是个可靠的人。好了，福尔摩斯先生，既然咱们要去那边，我倒有个问题想请教您。除了您以外，我跟谁也不会提这个问题。”说到这里，他环顾四周，一副不敢开口的模样。“按您看，这件事情会不会是尼尔·吉布森先生本人干的呢？”","“Well, it’s very handsome of you, I am sure. And your friend, Dr. Watson, can be trusted, I know. Now, Mr. Holmes, as we walk down to the place there is one question I should like to ask you. I’d breathe it to no soul but you.” He looked round as through he hardly dare utter the words. “Don’t you think there might be a case against Mr. Neil Gibson himself?”"
"“我也在想这个问题。”","“I have been considering that.”"
"“您还没见过邓巴小姐呢，她从哪方面来说都是个非常不错的女人。吉布森先生很可能会嫌他妻子挡了路。再说了，那些美国人可比咱们这边的人喜欢动枪。那把枪就是他的，您知道吧。”","“You’ve not seen Miss Dunbar. She is a wonderful fine woman in every way. He may well have wished his wife out of the road. And these Americans are readier with pistols than our folk are. It was his pistol, you know.”"
"“这一点得到确认了吗？”","“Was that clearly made out?”"
"“是的，先生。他有一对那样的手枪，那是其中的一把。”","“Yes, sir. It was one of a pair that he had.”"
"“一对当中的一把？另一把在哪儿呢？”","“One of a pair? Where is the other?”"
"“呃，这位先生有一大堆这样那样的火器。我们一直都没给那把枪配上对——不过，盒子确实是装两把枪的盒子。”","“Well, the gentleman has a lot of firearms of one sort and another. We never quite matched that particular pistol—but the box was made for two.”"
"“既然它本来就是一对当中的一把，你们肯定能给它配上对啊。”","“If it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it.”"
"“这个嘛，我们把所有的枪都摆在了那座宅子里，您想看就可以去看。”","“Well, we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over.”"
"“以后再看吧。要我说，咱们还是一起去惨案现场看看好了。”","“Later, perhaps. I think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy.”"
"前面这段对话发生在当地警局那间小小的前屋里，所谓的当地警局则不过是考文垂警长那座简陋的农舍而已。接下来，我们踏入了一片风声瑟瑟的荒野，凋零的蕨类植物把荒野染成了黄金和青铜的颜色。步行大概半英里之后，我们走进了雷神府邸的庭园侧门，然后就沿着一条小径穿过雉鸡猎场，进入一片空地，在那里看到了占地宽广的雷神大宅。砖木结构的宅子矗立在小山顶上，一半是都铎式，一半是乔治王时代的风格。我们的旁边是一个长长的苇塘，中央的水面最为狭窄，上面架着一座石桥，庭园里主要的马车道就从桥上经过，石桥两侧的水面倒是比较宽阔，形成了两个小小的湖泊。走到桥头的时候，我们的警长向导停了下来，指了指地面。","This conversation had taken place in the little front room of Sergeant Coventry’s humble cottage which served as the local police-station. A walk of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all gold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us to a side-gate opening into the grounds of the Thor Place estate. A path led us through the pheasant preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the widespread, half-timbered house, half Tudor and half Georgian, upon the crest of the hill. Beside us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the centre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on either side. Our guide paused at the mouth of this bridge, and he pointed to the ground."
"“吉布森太太的尸体就是在这里发现的，这块石头是我做的记号。”","“That was where Mrs. Gibson’s body lay. I marked it by that stone.”"
"“据我所知，您赶到的时候，尸体还没有挪动过吧？”","“I understand that you were there before it was moved?”"
"“是的，他们马上就通知了我。”","“Yes, they sent for me at once.”"
"“谁通知您的呢？”","“Who did?”"
"“就是吉布森先生本人。刚刚听说出了事，他就带着几个人从宅子里冲了下来，并且严令他们保护现场，等警察来了再说。”","“Mr. Gibson himself. The moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house, he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive.”"
"“这倒是明智之举。我从报上看到了，子弹是从很近的距离射出来的。” ","“That was sensible. I gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters.”"
"“是的，先生，非常近。” ","“Yes, sir, very close.”"
"“子弹是打在右边的太阳穴附近吗？”","“Near the right temple?”"
"“太阳穴后面一点点，先生。” ","“Just Behind it, sir.”"
"“尸体是什么样的姿势呢？”","“How did the body lie?”"
"“仰面朝天，先生。现场没有打斗的迹象。什么痕迹都没有，也没有武器。邓巴小姐写的那张条子是在太太身上发现的，太太把条子攥在了左手的手心。” ","“On the back, sir. No trace of a struggle. No marks. No weapon. The short note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.”"
"“攥在手心，是这样吗？”","“Clutched, you say?”"
"“是的，先生，我们好不容易才掰开了她的手指。”","“Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers.”"
"“这一点非常重要，它排除了有人在太太死后塞条子栽赃的可能性。我的天！按我的记忆，那张条子非常简短，是这么写的：‘我九点钟到雷神桥。——格 ·邓巴’对吗？”","“That is of great importance. It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. Dear me! The note, as I remember, was quite short: I will be at Thor Bridge at nine o’clock. – G. Dunbar. Was that not so?”"
"“对，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“邓巴小姐承认条子是她写的吗？”","“Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?”"
"“承认，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“她怎么解释这件事情呢？”","“What was her explanation?”"
"“她的辩词要留到巡回法庭上去说，眼下她什么也不肯讲。”","“Her defence was reserved for the Assizes. She would say nothing.”"
"“这件案子还真是挺有趣的。条子的事情完全是不明不白，不是吗？” ","“The problem is certainly a very interesting one. The point of the letter is very obscure, is it not?”"
"“呃，先生，”警长说道，“请允许我斗胆说一句，这好像是整件案子当中唯一的一个明明白白的地方啊。”","“Well, sir,” said the guide, “it seemed, if I may be so bold as to say so, the only really clear point in the whole case.”"
"福尔摩斯摇了摇头。","Holmes shook his head."
"“假设条子是真的，条子的内容也是真的，太太收到条子的时间肯定得比出事的时间早那么一两个小时。既然如此，出事之后，条子为什么还在她的左手里面呢？她为什么要这么小心翼翼地攥着它呢？条子里并没有写什么见面时还得拿着参考的内容啊。您不觉得这件事情很奇怪吗？”","“Granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was certainly received some time before—say one hour or two. Why, then, was this lady still clasping it in her left hand? Why should she carry it so carefully? She did not need to refer to it in the interview. Does it not seem remarkable?”"
"“呃，先生，听您这么一说，还真是有点儿奇怪。”","“Well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.”"
"“我觉得我应该安安静静地坐几分钟，好好地想想这个问题。”他在石砌的栏杆扶手上坐了下来，敏锐的灰色眼睛飞快地四下扫视。突然之间，他一跃而起，跑到对面的栏杆跟前，飞快地掏出兜里的放大镜，研究起石头来。","“I think I should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out.” He seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge, and I could see his quick gray eyes darting their questioning glances in every direction. Suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the opposite parapet, whipped his lens from his pocket, and began to examine the stonework."
"“奇怪。”他说道。","“This is curious,” said he."
"“是啊，先生，我们也看见了扶手上面的这块凿痕。依我看，这肯定是哪个过路人干的。”","“Yes, sir, we saw the chip on the ledge. I expect it’s been done by some passerby.”"
"石砌的扶手是灰色的，眼前的这个位置却有一块白色的痕迹，只有一枚六便士硬币[^13]那么大。仔细看就可以发现，这是一次猛烈撞击留下的痕迹。","The stonework was gray, but at this one point it showed white for a space not larger than a sixpence. When examined closely one could see that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow."
"“这可真需要一点儿蛮力才办得到呢。”福尔摩斯若有所思地说道。他抡起手杖敲了几下扶手，扶手完好无损。“没错，之前的那次撞击非常猛烈。还有啊，撞击的位置也很古怪，撞击不是来自上方，而是从下面来的，这不，痕迹是在扶手的下缘。”","“It took some violence to do that,” said Holmes thoughtfully. With his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark. “Yes, it was a hard knock. In a curious place, too. It was not from above but from below, for you see that it is on the *lower*edge of the parapet.”"
"“可是，这地方离尸体少说也有十五英尺啊。”","“But it is at least fifteen feet from the body.”"
"“没错，这地方跟尸体之间的距离就是十五英尺。这块痕迹兴许跟这件案子没什么关系，但却还是值得咱们留意一下。要我说，这儿已经没什么可看的啦。您刚才说现场没有脚印，对吗？”","“Yes, it is fifteen feet from the body. It may have nothing to do with the matter, but it is a point worth noting. I do not think that we have anything more to learn here. There were no footsteps, you say?”"
"“案发当时的地面硬得跟铁板一样，先生，什么痕迹都没有。”","“The ground was iron hard, sir. There were no traces at all.”"
"“那咱们就走吧。我们准备到上面的宅子里去看看您说的那些武器，接着就去温切斯特，因为我还是想先见见邓巴小姐，之后再作打算。”","“Then we can go. We will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak. Then we shall get on to Winchester, for I should desire to see Miss Dunbar before we go farther.”"
"尼尔·吉布森先生还没有从城里回来，可我们倒是在宅子里见到了上午的那位访客，也就是神经兮兮的贝茨先生。他幸灾乐祸地领着我们参观了一大堆令人胆寒的火器，这些火器各式各样，有大有小，全都是他的东家在惊险跌宕的一生中积攒起来的东西。","Mr. Neil Gibson had not returned from town, but we saw in the house the neurotic Mr. Bates who had called upon us in the morning. He showed us with a sinister relish the formidable array of firearms of various shapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an adventurous life."
"“吉布森先生树敌很多，可您要是对他和他的手段有所了解，也就不会觉得奇怪啦。”他说道。“就算是睡觉的时候，他也会在床边的抽屉里摆上一把上了膛的左轮手枪。他这个人非常凶暴，先生，有些时候，我们大家都会被他弄得提心吊胆。我敢肯定，刚刚过世的那位可怜女士经常都被他吓得够呛。”","“Mr. Gibson has his enemies, as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods,” said he. “He sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed. He is a man of violence, sir, and there are times when all of us are afraid of him. I am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified.”"
"“您亲眼见过他对她动手吗？”","“Did you ever witness physical violence towards her?”"
"“没有，这我倒没见过。可我听到过一些几乎跟动手一样伤人的话，那些话带着一种冰冷刺骨的轻蔑，当着仆人的面他也说。”","“No, I cannot say that. But I have heard words which were nearly as bad—words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants.”"
"“在私生活方面，这位富翁好像不怎么高明啊。”去车站的路上，福尔摩斯如是说道。“好了，华生，咱们已经掌握了不少情况，有一些还是新发现的情况，即便如此，我还是拿不出什么结论。显而易见，贝茨先生对他的东家深恶痛绝，可他还是告诉我，警报传来的时候，东家确确实实是在图书室里。当天的晚餐是八点半结束的，之前也一切正常。警报传来的时间虽然是在深夜，惨案发生的时间却肯定是跟条子上写的那个时间相去不远。吉布森先生是下午五点从城里回来的，没有任何迹象表明他后来又出过门。反过来，从我了解到的情况来看，邓巴小姐已经承认自己约了吉布森太太在桥上见面。其他的事情她一概不说，因为她的律师建议她把辩词保留到巡回法庭开庭的时候。咱们有几个至关紧要的问题，需要这位年青女士帮着解答，见到她之前，我心里是踏实不了的。必须承认的是，要不是因为一件事情的话，我自个儿也会觉得，局面对她非常不利。”","“Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life,” remarked Holmes as we made our way to the station. “Well, Watson, we have come on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way from my conclusion. In spite of the evident dislike which Mr. Bates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library. Dinner was over at 8:30 and all was normal up to then. It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note. There is no evidence at all that Mr. Gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five o’clock. On the other hand, Miss Dunbar, as I understand it, admits that she had made an appointment to meet Mrs. Gibson at the bridge. Beyond this she would say nothing, as her lawyer, had advised her to reserve her defence. We have several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her. I must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing.”"
"“哪件事情，福尔摩斯？”","“And what is that, Holmes?”"
"“在她衣橱里找到手枪的事情。”","“The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe.”"
"“天哪，福尔摩斯！”我大叫一声，“要我看，这件事情是最最确凿的一条罪证啊。”","“Dear me, Holmes!” I cried, “that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all.”"
"“不是这样的，华生。刚开始有点儿粗略想法的时候，我已经觉得这件事情非常古怪，眼下我对案情有了更多的了解，这件事情就成了我可以仰仗的唯一一座靠山。咱们必须替所有的事情找出逻辑，一旦有什么地方不合逻辑，咱们就得当心其中有诈。”","“Not so, Watson. It had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading as very strange, and now that I am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope. We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it we must suspect deception.”"
"“我没听明白你的意思。”","“I hardly follow you.”"
"“行啦，华生，咱们不妨暂时把你想象成一个女人。你打算通过一种预先安排的残忍方法来除掉一个情敌。你订好了计划，写好了条子，情敌如约赶来，你掏出武器实施了罪行，整个过程驾轻就熟，算无遗策。可是，完成了如此巧妙的一桩罪行之后，你竟然不把武器扔进近在咫尺的苇塘，永远地隐藏罪证，非得小心翼翼地把武器带回家，再把它放进自个儿的衣橱，明知道那是警方搜查的第一个目标，你说说，你会用这样的方式来败坏自己在犯罪行当里的名声吗？华生啊，真正了解你的人都不会管你叫做谋略大师，即便如此，我还是觉得你干不出这么拙劣的事情。”","“Well now, Watson, suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to get rid of a rival. You have planned it. A note has been written. The victim has come. You have your weapon. The crime is done. It has been workmanlike and complete. Do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which would forever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be searched? Your best friends would hardly call you a schemer, Watson, and yet I could not picture you doing anything so crude as that.”"
"“可是，情急之下——”","“In the excitement of the moment—”"
"“不，不会的，华生，我绝不相信世上会有这样的事情。出自冷静预谋的罪行必然伴有出自冷静预谋的灭迹方法。所以我才抱有一线希望，希望眼前的事情仅仅是一种严重的错觉。”","“No, no, Watson, I will not admit that it is possible. Where a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of a serious misconception.”"
"“可是，需要澄清的疑点还很多啊。”","“But there is so much to explain.”"
"“这个嘛，咱们这就可以展开澄清疑点的工作。只需要换一换视角，你就会发现，特别不利的那些证据恰恰是提示真相的线索。例子之一就是那把左轮手枪。邓巴小姐说她完全不知道手枪的事情，咱们的新假设又表明她说的是实话，这样一来，那把枪就必然是别人放在她衣橱里的。谁放的呢？自然是某个想要嫁祸于她的人。如此说来，嫁祸的人不就是真正的凶手吗？你瞧，咱们马上就看到了一条极有价值的调查线索。”","“Well, we shall set about explaining it. When once your point of view is changed, the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth. For example, there is this revolver. Miss Dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it. On our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so. Therefore, it was placed in her wardrobe. Who placed it there? Someone who wished to incriminate her. Was not that person the actual criminal? You see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry.”"
"探监的手续仍然没有办妥，当晚我们只好住在了温切斯特。还好，次日早上我们就得到了入狱探视这位年青女士的许可，陪我们去的则是受托为她辩护的律师界新秀乔伊斯·卡明斯先生。根据之前的所有传闻，我早已知道这次要见的是一位美丽女子，即便如此，邓巴小姐仍然给我留下了永生难忘的印象。怪不得，就连那个专横跋扈的富豪都会在邓巴小姐身上看到一种比自己还要强大的东西，看到一种可以约束他、指引他的东西。只需要看看她那张轮廓分明、坚定却不失敏感的脸庞，谁都会觉得，即便她会有鲁莽行事的时候，固有的高贵品格仍然能保证她始终把自身的力量用到善的方向。她肤色微黑，身材颀长，仪态优雅，气势逼人，可她乌黑的眼睛却带着一种哀恳无助的神情，仿佛是一只明知罗网逼近却无法找到出路的猎物。到这会儿，她意识到我那位大名鼎鼎的朋友已经赶来相救，苍白的双颊便泛上了一丝血色，投向我们的目光里也亮起了一点希望的火花。","We were compelled to spend the night at Winchester, as the formalities had not yet been completed, but next morning, in the company of Mr. Joyce Cummings, the rising barrister who was entrusted with the defence, we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell. I had expected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but I can never forget the effect which Miss Dunbar produced upon me. It was no wonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something more powerful than himself—something which could control and guide him. One felt, too, as one looked at the strong, clear-cut, and yet sensitive face, that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed, none the less there was an innate nobility of character which would make her influence always for the good. She was a brunette, tall, with a noble figure and commanding presence, but her dark eyes had in them the appealing, helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the nets around it, but can see no way out from the toils. Now, as she realized the presence and the help of my famous friend, there came a touch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer in the glance which she turned upon us."
"“尼尔·吉布森先生已经把我和他之间的一些事情告诉了您，对吗？”她惴惴不安地低声问道。","“Perhaps Mr. Neil Gibson has told you something of what occurred between us?” she asked in a low, agitated voice."
"“是的。”福尔摩斯回答道，“您不需要讲述那些让您难堪的事情。见到您之后，我觉得吉布森先生没说假话，您对他的影响力是真的，你们俩之间关系清白也是真的。可是，您为什么不把全部的情况讲给地方法庭听呢？”","“Yes,” Holmes answered, “you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story. After seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr. Gibson’s statement both as to the influence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him. But why was the whole situation not brought out in court?”"
"“当时我觉得，如此荒谬的指控肯定是难以为继。所以我就想，如果我们等等的话，整件事情一定会自动澄清，用不着我们谈论那些涉及家庭私隐的难堪细节。可是，现在我已经知道，事情不但没有澄清，反倒是愈演愈烈。”","“It seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained. Ithought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family. But I understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious.”"
"“亲爱的小姐啊，”福尔摩斯语调恳切地高声说道，“您可千万不要抱这样的幻想。这位卡明斯先生可以明明白白地告诉您，桌上所有的牌都对您不利，咱们只有全力以赴才能摆脱困境。我要是硬说您面临的危险不算太大，那就是一种残忍的欺骗。所以呢，您一定要尽力帮助我查明真相。”","“My dear young lady,” cried Holmes earnestly, “I beg you to have no illusions upon the point. Mr. Cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear. It would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger. Give me all the help you can, then, to get at the truth.”"
"“我绝不隐瞒任何事情。”","“I will conceal nothing.”"
"“那好，说说您和吉布森太太的确切关系吧。”","“Tell us, then, of your true relations with Mr. Gibson’s wife.”"
"“她恨我，福尔摩斯先生，用尽了她全部的热带烈性来恨我。她这个人做什么事情都是毫无保留，她对她丈夫有多爱，对我也就有多恨。她多半是误会了我和她丈夫的关系。我不想说什么对她不公道的话，可她那种身体层面的爱情实在是太过强烈，因此就理解不了我和她丈夫之间这种精神层面乃至宗教层面的纽带，同时也无法想象，我之所以留在她家，仅仅是想把她丈夫的力量引上为善之途。现在我知道自己想错了，什么事情也不能成为我留下的理由，因为我已经变成了他人不幸的根源，话又说回来，可以肯定的是，那种不幸并不会随着我的离去而消失。”","“She hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature. She was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me. It is probable that she misunderstood our relations. I would not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even spiritual, tie which held her husband to me, or imagine that it was only my desire to influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof. I can see now that I was wrong. Nothing could justify me in remaining where I was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if I had left the house.”"
"“好了，邓巴小姐，”福尔摩斯说道，“麻烦您把当天晚上的事情原原本本地讲出来吧。”","“Now, Miss Dunbar,” said Holmes, “I beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening.”"
"“我可以把我知道的情况和盘托出，福尔摩斯先生，可我什么也证明不了，有一些细节——而且是至关紧要的细节——不光是超出了我自己所能解释的范围，在我看来还是根本无法解释的事情。”","“I can tell you the truth so far as I know it, Mr. Holmes, but I am in a position to prove nothing, and there are points—the most vital points—which I can neither explain nor can I imagine any explanation.”"
"“只要您提供事实，别的人兴许可以提供解释。”","“If you will find the facts, perhaps others may find the explanation.”"
"“好吧，当晚我之所以会去雷神桥，是因为我早上收到了吉布森太太的条子。条子就放在孩子课室的桌子上，兴许是她亲手放的。她恳求我晚餐之后到雷神桥去见她，说是有要事相告，还叫我把答复放在花园里的日晷上，因为她不希望别人知道这件事情。我不明白她为什么要做得这么隐秘，可我还是按她说的方法给出了答复，同意去见她。她要求我销毁她的条子，我就把条子扔进了课室的壁炉。她非常害怕她丈夫，因为她丈夫对她非常冷酷，我还经常为这件事情谴责她的丈夫呢。所以我只能推测，她之所以这么做，原因是她不想让丈夫知道我俩见面的事情。”","“With regard, then, to my presence at Thor Bridge that night, I received a note from Mrs. Gibson in the morning. It lay on the table of the schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her own hand. It implored me to see her there after dinner, said she had something important to say to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be in our confidence. I saw no reason for such secrecy, but I did as she asked, accepting the appointment. She asked me to destroy her note and I burned it in the schoolroom grate. She was very much afraid of her husband, who treated her with a harshness for which I frequently reproached him, and I could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview.”"
"“可她自己不是小心翼翼地保存着您的答复吗？”","“Yet she kept your reply very carefully?”"
"“是啊。听说她死的时候都还把条子捏在手里，我真是吃了一惊。”","“Yes. I was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died.”"
"“好吧，后来又怎么样呢？”","“Well, what happened then?”"
"“我如约前往见面地点。我走到桥头的时候，她已经在那里等着了。直到那一刻，我才真正认识到这个可怜的妇人恨我恨到了什么程度。她简直是一个疯婆子——现在想来，我觉得她就是一个疯婆子，只不过她拥有疯子往往会有的那种高超的欺骗本领，疯得不露痕迹。她心里装着如此狂暴的仇恨，但却还是可以行若无事地跟我天天见面，不是疯子又是什么呢？我不想重复她当时说的那些话，总而言之，她把满腔的疯狂怒火都变成了无比激烈、无比可怕的言语。我甚至没有回答——我没法回答。她那副样子真让人看不下去，于是我捂着耳朵逃离了那里。我跑开的时候，她仍然站在桥头，仍然在冲我尖声怒骂。”","“I went down as I had promised. When I reached the bridge she was waiting for me. Never did I realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me. She was like a mad woman— indeed, I think she *was* a mad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have. How else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart? I will not say what she said. She poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words. I did not even answer—I could not. It was dreadful to see her. I put my hands to my ears and rushed away. When I left her she was standing, still shrieking out her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.”"
"“是在他们发现尸体的那个地方吗？”","“Where she was afterwards found?”"
"“离那个地方只有几码[^14]的距离。”","“Within a few yards from the spot.”"
"“可是，既然她的死亡是您刚走不久的事情，您难道没有听见枪声吗？”","“And yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?”"
"“没有，我什么也没听见。不过，说真的，福尔摩斯先生，她这次可怕的爆发弄得我烦乱极了，所以我一心只想赶回自己的房间去图个清静，根本留意不到别的事情。”","“No, I heard nothing. But, indeed, Mr. Holmes, I was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that I rushed to get back to the peace of my own room, and I was incapable of noticing anything which happened.”"
"“按您的说法，您立刻回房去了。第二天早上之前，您还出过门吗？”","“You say that you returned to your room. Did you leave it again before next morning.”"
"“是的，有人来报告这个可怜妇人的死讯，我就跟其他人一起跑了出去。”","“Yes, when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death I ran out with the others.”"
"“当时您看到吉布森先生了吗？”","“Did you see Mr. Gibson?”"
"“看到了，他刚刚从桥那边回来，那时他已经派了人去请医生和警察。”","“Yes, he had just returned from the bridge when I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and the police.”"
"“按您的感觉，当时他显得慌乱吗？”","“Did he seem to you much perturbed?”"
"“吉布森先生是一个非常坚强、非常内敛的人，我觉得他从来都不会把心里的感觉摆在脸上。可我对他非常了解，所以就看得出来，他确实深受打击。”","“Mr. Gibson is a very strong, self-contained man. I do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface. But I, who knew him so well, could see that he was deeply concerned.”"
"“好了，咱们这就来谈谈最重要的那个问题，也就是他们在您的房间里找到的那把手枪。您以前见过那把枪吗？”","“Then we come to the all-important point. This pistol that was found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?”"
"“从来没见过，我可以发誓。”","“Never, I swear it.”"
"“枪是什么时候找到的呢？”","“When was it found?” "
"“第二天早上，警察就是在那个时候来搜查的。”","“Next morning, when the police made their search.”"
"“是在您的衣物当中找到的吗？”","“Among your clothes?” "
"“是的，在我衣橱的底板上，埋在我那些裙子下面。”","“Yes, on the floor of my wardrobe under mydresses.” "
"“您估计得出枪在您的衣橱里藏了多久吗？”","“You could not guess how long it had been there?” "
"“头天早上还不在我的衣橱里。”","“It had not been there the morning before.” "
"“您怎么知道呢？”","“How do you know?” "
"“头天早上我收拾过衣橱。”","“Because I tidied out the wardrobe.” "
"“这么说的话，事情就没有什么疑问了。也就是说，有人溜进了您的房间，把枪放在那里嫁祸于您。”","“That is final. Then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you.”"
"“只能这么解释。”","“It must have been so.”"
"“什么时候放的呢？”","“And when?”"
"“只能是在吃饭时间，要不就是我在课室里教孩子的时候。”","“It could only have been at meal-time, or else at the hours when I would be in the schoolroom with the children.”"
"“也就是您收到条子的时候吗？”","“As you were when you got the note?”"
"“是的，从收到条子的时候开始，再加上接下来的一整个上午。”","“Yes, from that time onward for the whole morning.”"
"“谢谢您，邓巴小姐。还有什么能帮助我查案的情况吗？”","“Thank you, Miss Dunbar. Is there any other point which could help me in the investigation?”"
"“我想不到别的了。”","“I can think of none.”"
"“桥栏的扶手上有一块猛烈撞击的痕迹，一块非常新的凿痕，就在正对尸体的地方。这件事情您有什么解释吗？”","“There was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge—a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body. Could you suggest any possible explanation of that?”"
"“应该只是一种巧合吧。”","“Surely it must be a mere coincidence.”"
"“奇怪啊，邓巴小姐，奇怪极了。凿痕为什么偏偏出现在惨案发生的时候，为什么偏偏出现在惨案发生的地点呢？”","“Curious, Miss Dunbar, very curious. Why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy, and why at the very place?”"
"“可它能是什么东西造成的呢？只有非常猛烈的撞击才能留下这种痕迹啊。”","“But what could have caused it? Only great violence could have such an effect.”"
"福尔摩斯没有回答。他那张热切的苍白脸庞突然带上了一种专注悠远的神情，根据我的经验，这样的神情往往出现在他将自己的天才发挥到了极致的时刻。他脑子里那个千钧一发的时刻表现得如此明显，以至于律师、囚犯和我一时间都不敢出声，只能坐在那里，全神贯注地盯着他看。突然之间，他从椅子上一跃而起，跃跃欲试，火急火燎，整个人都颤抖起来。","Holmes did not answer. His pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that tense, faraway expression which I had learned to associate with the supreme manifestations of his genius. So evident was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous energy and the pressing need for action."
"“快，华生，快！”他大叫起来。","“Come, Watson, come!” he cried."
"“怎么啦，福尔摩斯先生？”","“What is it, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“没怎么，亲爱的小姐。卡明斯先生，我会捎信给您的。仰赖正义之神的帮助，我会让您赢下一件必将轰动全国的案子。邓巴小姐，明天之前我就会给您消息，与此同时，您尽管收下我的保证：乌云正在消散，而我深信不疑，真相的曙光终将到来。”","“Never mind, my dear lady. You will hear from me, Mr. Cummings. With the help of the god of justice I will give you a case which will make England ring. You will get news by tomorrow, Miss Dunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through.”"
"温切斯特和雷神府邸之间的距离并不算远，可我心情急迫，自然是觉得长路迢迢。福尔摩斯呢，显然是觉得这段旅程漫长无尽，因为他焦躁得根本就坐不住，一会儿在车厢里走来走去，一会儿又用修长灵敏的手指使劲儿地敲打身边的坐垫。不过，快到终点的时候，他突然坐到了我的对面——我俩包下了一个头等车厢——两只手分别搭在我的两个膝盖上，直视着我的眼睛，眼神之中带着格外强烈的恶作剧意味，正是他顽童性情萌发之时的典型表现。","It was not a long journey from Winchester to Thor Place, but it was long to me in my impatience, while for Holmes it was evident that it seemed endless; for, in his nervous restlessness, he could not sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive fingers upon the cushions beside him. Suddenly, however, as we neared our destination he seated himself opposite to me—we had a first-class carriage to ourselves—and laying a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was characteristic of his more imp-like moods."
"“华生啊。”他说道，“我似乎记得，跟我出来兜风的时候，你总是带着武器的。”","“Watson,” said he, “I have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours.”"
"我带武器也是为了他好。专心研究问题的时候，他总是完全不顾自己的安全，这样一来，我的左轮手枪就不止一次地扮演了患难知交的角色。眼下他说到了武器的事情，我便提醒他不要忘了这个事实。","It was as well for him that I did so, for he took little care for his own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem, so that more than once my revolver had been a good friend in need. I reminded him of the fact."
"“是，是，我对这些事情确实有点儿心不在焉。不说这个，你那把左轮手枪在身上吗？”","“Yes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such matters. But have you your revolver on you?”"
"我从屁股兜里把枪掏了出来。这把枪枪身很短，便于携带，但却是一件非常趁手的小小武器。他拉开保险扣，抖出子弹，仔细地看了起来。","I produced it from my hip-pocket, a short, handy, but very serviceable little weapon. He undid the catch, shook out the cartridges, and examined it with care."
"“挺沉的，沉得出奇。”他说道。","“It’s heavy—remarkably heavy,” said he."
"“是啊，这把枪做得非常结实。”","“Yes, it is a solid bit of work.”"
"他看着枪想了片刻。","He mused over it for a minute."
"“你知道吗，华生。”他说道，“据我看，你这把枪将会跟咱们手头的谜案产生十分紧密的联系。”","“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “I believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating.”"
"“福尔摩斯老兄，你这是开玩笑吧。”","“My dear Holmes, you are joking.”"
"“不，华生，一点儿也不开玩笑。咱们得做一个实验，实验成功的话，案子就会水落石出。还有啊，实验的成败全得看这把小小武器的表现。好啦，一颗子弹留下，其余五颗装回去，再扣上保险扣。行了！这一来，枪的重量就会增加，实验的结果也会更加准确。”","“No, Watson, I am very serious. There is a test before us. If the test comes off all will be clear. And the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon. One cartridge out. Now we will replace the other five and put on the safety-catch. So! That increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction.”"
"我完全不知道他打的是什么主意，他也不作进一步的解释，只是坐在那里沉思默想，直到火车开进那个汉普郡小站为止。接下来，我们雇来一辆行将散架的轻便马车，一刻钟之后就赶到了那位故作神秘的警长朋友家里。","I had no glimmer of what was in his mind, nor did he enlighten me, but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little Hampshire station. We secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant."
"“有线索啦，福尔摩斯先生？什么线索呢？”","“A clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?”"
"“全都得看华生医生那把左轮手枪的表现。”福尔摩斯说道。“喏，枪就在这儿。好了，警官，您能给我十码绳子吗？”","“It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Watson’s revolver,” said my friend. “Here it is. Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of string?”"
"村里的商店供应了一团十分结实的绳子。","The village shop provided a ball of stout twine."
"“依我看，咱们这就算是万事俱备啦。”福尔摩斯说道。“好了，劳驾你们跟我一起上路吧，这应该是咱们这次旅程的最后一段了。”","“I think that this is all we will need,” said Holmes. “Now, if you please, we will get off on what I hope is the last stage of our journey.”"
"斜晖映照之下，连绵起伏的汉普郡荒野呈现出一派令人赞叹的秋日美景。警长拖着步子走在我俩身边，一次又一次地投来了挑剔和狐疑的目光，显然是对我朋友的神志产生了极大的怀疑。走近犯罪现场的时候，我发现我朋友虽然保持着惯常的镇静模样，实际上却已经心急如焚。","The sun was setting and turning the rolling Hampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal panorama. The sergeant, with many critical and incredulous glances, which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched along beside us. As we approached the scene of the crime I could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated."
"“是啊。”他回答的是我的目光，“华生，你是见过我失手的。我对这些事情的直觉非常好，可我有时也会上直觉的当。在温切斯特那间牢房里的时候，我突然有了一种直觉，当时还觉得它准保没错，可是，活跃的头脑也有一个坏处，总能让你想到一些其他的解释，让你怀疑自个儿的判断靠不住。然而——然而——呃，华生，没办法，只能一试。”","“Yes,” he said in answer to my remark, “you have seen me miss my mark before, Watson. I have all instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at Winchester, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet—and yet—Well, Watson, we can but try.”"
"前行过程之中，他把绳子的一端牢牢地绑在了左轮手枪的枪把上。到这会儿，我们已经来到了惨案现场。在警长的指引之下，他仔仔细细地标出了尸体原先所在的精确位置。接下来，他在周围的石南和蕨类植物丛中搜寻了一番，终于找来了一块相当不小的石头。他把绳子的另一端绑在石头上，又把石头从桥栏扶手上方往苇塘里放，一直放到了贴近水面的地方。这之后，他站在了刚刚标出的那个不祥位置，跟桥边稍微隔着一点儿距离，手里仍然拿着我那把左轮手枪，拴在枪上的绳子已经被绳子另一端的沉重石头绷得紧紧的了。","As he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of the revolver. We had now reached the scene of the tragedy. With great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot where the body had been stretched. He then hunted among the heather and the ferns until he found a considerable stone. This he secured to the other end of his line of string, and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge so that it swung clear above the water. He then stood on the fatal spot, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand, the string being taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side."
"“来吧！”他大喊一声。","“Now for it!” he cried."
"话音未落，他已经把手枪举到头上，跟着就松了手。转眼之间，手枪在石头重量的作用之下飞快地冲向桥边，“啪”的一声击中桥栏的扶手，跟着就越过栏杆，沉到了水里。手枪刚刚消失，福尔摩斯已经迫不及待地跪在了栏杆旁边，随即欢呼一声，显然是看到了预期的效果。","At the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his grip. In an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had vanished over the side into the water. It had hardly gone before Holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he had found what he expected."
"“还有比这更准确的演示吗？”他高声说道。“瞧啊，华生，问题已经被你的左轮手枪解决啦！”说话的时候，他一直用手指着刚刚出现在石砌扶手下缘的一块凿痕，凿痕的大小和形状都跟先前那块凿痕一模一样。","“Was there ever a more exact demonstration?” he cried. “See, Watson, your revolver has solved the problem!” As he spoke he pointed to a second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade."
"“我们会在村里的旅馆住一宿。”他站起身来，冲着大惊失色的警长说道。“当然喽，您可以去弄一套抓钩，不费多少力气就可以把我朋友的手枪捞起来。除此之外，您还会在他的手枪旁边找到另一把左轮手枪，上面也连着绳子和重物，全都是那个报复心强的女人留下的工具，用途是掩盖自己的罪行[^15]，同时把谋杀的罪名扣在一个无辜者的身上。麻烦您通知吉布森先生，我明天早上会去找他，以便为邓巴小姐洗雪冤情。”","“We’ll stay at the inn tonight,” he continued as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. “You will, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will easily restore my friend’s revolver. You will also find beside it the revolver, string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim. You can let Mr. Gibson know that I will see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for Miss Dunbar’s vindication.”"
"当天入夜时分，我俩坐在本村的旅馆里抽烟斗，福尔摩斯简单地回顾了一下之前的事情。","Late that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village inn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed."
"“依我看，华生。”他说道，“你要是把雷神桥的谜案写成了故事，恐怕也不能为我或许拥有的那点儿声誉锦上添花。这次我反应迟钝，揉合想象与现实的能力也有所欠缺，而那正是我这个行当必不可少的基本素质。说老实话，光是石头栏杆上的那块凿痕就足以揭示真正的答案，我没能更快地解决问题，完全是我自己的责任。","“I fear, Watson,” said he, “that you will not improve any reputation which I may have acquired by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and that I blame myself for not having attained it sooner."
"“不容否认的是，这个不幸女人的心机确实是渊深叵测，要识破她的阴谋并不是一件非常简单的事情。依我看，关于扭曲爱情的可怕力量，咱们的办案生涯当中还从来不曾有过比这件案子更为离奇的例证。看样子，不管邓巴小姐的情敌身份是不是只有精神层面的意义，在她眼里都是同样地不可饶恕。她丈夫用冷酷的态度和无情的话语来拒斥她那种过于直露的爱意，而她显然是把所有的委屈都算成了这位无辜女士的罪过。她的第一个决断是结束自己的生命，第二个决断则是采用一种特定的自戕方式，借此为她的目标安排一种比猝然死亡还要可怕得多的命运。","“It must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman’s mind were deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to unravel her plot. I do not think that in our adventures we have ever come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about. Whether Miss Dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes. No doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative affection. Her first resolution was to end her own life. Her second was to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden death could be."
"“咱们可以清清楚楚地看到她实施计划的各个步骤，这些步骤都体现着一颗老谋深算的头脑。她通过非常聪明的手法从邓巴小姐那里骗来了一张条子，好让人以为犯罪地点出自邓巴小姐的安排。她急于让人发现条子，到死都把它捏在手里，这样的做法多少有点儿过犹不及。单凭这一点，我就应该更早地看出其中有诈。","“We can follow the various steps quite clearly, and they show a remarkable subtlety of mind. A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. In her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. This alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did."
"“这之后，她拿上她丈夫的一把左轮手枪——你也看见了，她家的宅子堪称是一座武库——把枪留在手边备用。同一天上午，她将一把同样的手枪藏进了邓巴小姐的衣橱，藏之前还用它放了一枪。放枪的事情她可以在树林里做，很容易就可以瞒过别人的耳目。然后呢，她去了雷神桥，预先安排好了这种隐匿武器的精妙方法。邓巴小姐到场之后，她借着最后的一口气发泄出了满心的仇恨，等邓巴小姐跑到听不见枪声的地方之后，她便将可怕的最后一步付诸实施。到这会儿，所有的环节都已就位，事件的链条也已经构筑完整。记者们兴许会追问，干吗不一上来就去苇塘里打捞证据，不过，事后聪明可没有什么了不起，何况苇塘那么大，如果没有预先判定打捞的目标和位置的话，打捞证据再怎么说也不是一件容易的事情。好啦，华生，这次咱们帮到的是一个不一般的女人，再加上一个强有力的男人。如果事态按照眼前的趋势发展，他俩将来走到了一起的话，金融世界兴许会发现，尼尔·吉布森先生还是从那座教授人生课程的苦难课堂里学到了一点儿东西的。”","“Then she took one of her husband’s revolvers—there was, as you saw, an arsenal in the house—and kept it for her own use. A similar one she concealed that morning in Miss Dunbar’s wardrobe after discharging one barrel, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention. She then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when she was out of hearing, carried out her terrible purpose. Every link is now in its place and the chain is complete. The papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance, but it is easy to be wise after the event, and in any case the expanse of a reed-filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where. Well, Watson, we have helped a remarkable woman, and also a formidable man. Should they in the future join their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial world may find that Mr. Neil Gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught.”"
