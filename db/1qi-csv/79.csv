"姑娘和骗局","The Girl and the Graft"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"一天，我偶然碰见老朋友弗格森·波格。波格是一个顶级的职业骗子。他主要在西半球活动，从倒卖埃斯塔卡多大平原上的城镇土地，到在康涅狄格州销售木制玩具——这种玩具其实是通过把肉豆蔻果的粉末液压为浆状而制成的，他所经营的业务可谓应有尽有。","The other day I ran across my old friend Ferguson Pogue.Pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type.His headquarters is the Western Hemisphere, and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the Great Staked Plains to selling wooden toys in Connecticut, made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp."
"波格大赚了一笔以后，就会时不时来纽约放松放松。他说，在荒野做生意时，那种有酒、面包，还有女人相伴的日子过得非常悠闲惬意，就像塔夫脱总统在科尼艾兰游乐场坐过山车似的。波格说：“给我一座大城市，让我来度假。尤其是纽约。我不怎么待见纽约人，这世界上看不到纽约人的地方，大约也就只有曼哈顿了。”","Now and then when Pogue has made a good haul he comes to New York for a rest.He says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and Thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at Coney would be to President Taft.“Give me,” says Pogue, “a big city for my vacation.Especially New York.I’m not much fond of New Yorkers, and Manhattan is about the only place on the globe where I don’t find any.”"
"在这个大都市里，要想找波格，只要去两个地方就行。一个是位于第四大街的一家小二手书店，他常在那里翻阅他爱看的有关伊斯兰教和动物标本剥制技术的书籍。我在另一个地方——第十八大街上他的走廊小卧室里找到了他——当时他只穿着袜子坐着，正拉着小齐特琴，试图弹奏《沃巴什河岸》。这首曲子他已经练了四年，却还是不在调上，就像离水太远，用最长的钓鱼线也够不到水边一般。梳妆台上放着一把四五口径的蓝钢科尔特左轮手枪，旁边紧紧裹着一卷面额为十美元和二十美元的钞票，这钞票卷很大，大约属于春天响尾蛇故事里提及的那个级别。邻近的走廊里，一个打扫房间的女仆进不了卧室，又不能逃走，只好徘徊着。她反感波格只穿着袜子的脚，害怕科尔特左轮手枪，然而大都市生活带给她的本能又使她无法抵抗那卷黄色钞票对她魔法般的诱惑。","While in the metropolis Pogue can always be found at one of two places.One is a little second-hand book-shop on Fourth Avenue, where he reads books about his hobbies, Mahometanism and taxidermy.I found him at the other—his hall bedroom in Eighteenth Street—where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck “The Banks of the Wabash” out of a small zither.Four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the water’s edge.On the dresser lay a blued-steel Colt’s forty-five and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake-story class.A chambermaid with a room-cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall, unable to enter or to flee, scandalized by the stocking feet, aghast at the Colt’s, yet powerless, with her metropolitan instincts, to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow-hued roll."
"我坐在弗格森·波格的箱子上听他诉说。没有人说话比他更直率、坦白。与他的表达方式相比，亨利·詹姆斯一个月大时想吃奶的哭声就像是扶乩的密码。他自豪地向我讲述他那行业的故事，因为在他看来那是种艺术。我充满好奇，问他有没有见过女性干那一行。","I sat on his trunk while Ferguson Pogue talked.No one could be franker or more candid in his conversation.Beside his expression the cry of Henry James for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a Chaldean cryptogram.He told me stories of his profession with pride, for he considered it an art.And I was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it."
"“女士？”波格带着西方骑士的风范说，“哦，没有多少。特殊骗局她们干得不多，因为她们总是忙于一般骗术。什么？哎，她们不得不这么做。这个世界谁有钱？男人。你见过有哪个男人会不假思索地给女人哪怕一美元钱吗？男人可以轻易地白白给另一个男人钱，而不求回报。但是如果他往夏娃夫人女儿协会经营的售货机里投进去一枚硬币，而菠萝味的口香糖却没有在他拉下控制杆时掉出来的话，你在四个街区以外都可以听到他踢售货机的声音。对女人而言，最难对付的就是男人。男人是低等的矿石，女人要下番苦工才能有所收益。五次里有两次，女人都吃亏了。女人购置不起碎石机和昂贵的机器。男人注意到了女人，并参与到游戏之中。女人不得不淘洗手头现有的低劣矿石，而这会弄伤她们娇嫩的手。有些女人是天然的洗矿槽，每吨可收益一千美元。欲哭无泪的女人只能借助署名信函、假发、同情、袋鼠步、牛皮鞭、厨艺、多愁善感、能说会道、丝质内衣、门第、胭脂、匿名信、紫罗兰香囊、目击者、左轮手枪、充气隆胸垫、石炭酸、月光、美容霜和晚报来赢得男人的欢心。”","“Ladies?” said Pogue, with Western chivalry.“Well, not to any great extent.They don’t amount to much in special lines of graft, because they’re all so busy in general lines.What?Why, they have to.Who’s got the money in the world?The men.Did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration?A man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis.But if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the Madam Eve’s Daughters’ Amalgamated Association and the pineapple chewing gum don’t fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away.Man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against.He’s the low-grade one, and she has to work overtime to make him pay.Two times out of five she’s salted.She can’t put in crushers and costly machinery.He’d notice ’em and be onto the game.They have to pan out what they get, and it hurts their tender hands.Some of ’em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out $1,000 to the ton.The dry-eyed ones have to depend on signed letters, false hair, sympathy, the kangaroo walk, cowhide whips, ability to cook, sentimental juries, conversational powers, silk underskirts, ancestry, rouge, anonymous letters, violet sachet powders, witnesses, revolvers, pneumatic forms, carbolic acid, moonlight, cold cream and the evening newspapers.”"
"“你太无礼了，弗格森，”我说，“在一个完美、和谐的婚姻组合中，肯定没有你所谓的‘骗局’！”","“You are outrageous, Ferg,” I said.“Surely there is none of this ‘graft’ as you call it, in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union!”"
"“哎，”波格说，“不是那种每次总能给你充分的理由来打电话给警察总部，请他们派出一群后备警员和一个杂耍演员一样的警长，让他们笨手笨脚地忙得团团转的那种骗局。但是，我指的是：假设你是一位以不正当手段发财致富的第五大街的百万富翁。","“Well,” said Pogue, “nothing that would justify you every time in calling Police Headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run.But it’s this way: Suppose you’re a Fifth Avenue millionaire, soaring high, on the right side of copper and cappers."
"“你晚上回家，带回去一个值九百万美元的钻石胸针，递给和你永结同心的女士。你把它递给她。她说‘哦，乔治！’，并细看那个胸针，试图辨明真伪。她走上前来吻你。这正是你所期盼的。你如愿以偿。好了。那就是个骗局。","“You come home at night and bring a $9,000,000 diamond brooch to the lady who’s staked you for a claim.You hand it over.She says, ‘Oh, George!’ and looks to see if it’s backed.She comes up and kisses you.You’ve waited for it.You get it.All right.It’s graft."
"“但是我想给你讲讲阿尔泰米西娅·布莱的故事。她是堪萨斯人；看到她，人们就会联想到玉米的各个部分。她的头发如同玉米须那般金黄；她身材高挑、体型优雅，好似湿润夏天长在低地里的玉米秆；她的眼睛大而有神，就像玉米苞一般水灵。她最喜欢绿色。","“But I’m telling you about Artemisia Blye.She was from Kansas and she suggested corn in all of its phases.Her hair was as yellow as the silk; her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer; her eyes were as big and startling as bunions, and green was her favorite color."
"“我最近一次去你们那个偏僻城市的清凉的休养之地时，遇到了一个叫沃克劳斯的人。他身价——就是说，他有一百万。他告诉我他在那条街道上做生意。‘街边小贩？'我讽刺道。‘完全正确，'他说，‘铺路公司的高级伙伴。'","“On my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city I met a human named Vaucross.He was worth—that is, he had a million.He told me he was in business on the street.‘A sidewalk merchant?’ says I, sarcastic.‘Exactly,’ says he, ‘Senior partner of a paving concern.’"
"“我有些喜欢他了。因为这个原因，有天晚上我正走霉运、心情不好、没有烟抽、无处可去时，就去百老汇和他见面。他头戴真丝礼帽，全身珠光宝气。他一表人才。如果当时是你走在他身后，你肯定会自惭形秽。我当时看起来就像托尔斯泰伯爵和一只六月龙虾的相貌杂合体。我不走运。我一直不走运——但是让我把注意力重新转到那个生意人身上吧。","“I kind of took to him.For this reason, I met him on Broadway one night when I was out of heart, luck, tobacco and place.He was all silk hat, diamonds and front.He was all front.If you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face.I looked like a cross between Count Tolstoy and a June lobster.I was out of luck.I had—but let me lay my eyes on that dealer again."
"“沃克劳斯停下来，和我聊了几分钟，然后领我去了一家高档饭店吃晚饭。我在那儿听到了些乐曲，而后听了贝多芬的曲子；那儿还有波尔多调味汁、法语的诅咒声、奶油杏仁饼，以及傲慢和香烟。我有钱的时候对这样的地方并不陌生。","“Vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a high-toned restaurant to eat dinner.There was music, and then some Beethoven, and Bordelaise sauce, and cussing in French, and frangipangi, and some hauteur and cigarettes.When I am flush I know them places."
"“我敢说，坐在那里，我的窝囊样肯定和一个身无分文的杂志画家没什么分别；我头发凌乱，活像要在布鲁克林的波希米亚男人聚会里念上一章《埃尔茜的学校生活》一样。但沃克劳斯对待我像对待一名猎熊的向导。他不怕伤服务员的感情。","“I declare, I must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like I was booked to read a chapter from ‘Elsie’s School Days’ at a Brooklyn Bohemian smoker.But Vaucross treated me like a bear hunter’s guide.He wasn’t afraid of hurting the waiter’s feelings."
"“‘波格先生，’他向我解释说，‘我在利用你。’","“‘Mr. Pogue,’ he explains to me, ‘I am using you.’ "
"“‘继续说，’我说，‘我希望你不要清醒。’","“‘Go on,’ says I; ‘I hope you don’t wake up.’ "
"“之后他告诉我他是怎样一种人。他是纽约人。他的所有抱负就是希望引人注目。他想要出众。他想人们认出他、向他鞠躬、告诉其他人他是谁。他说，那已成为他一生的夙愿。他只有一百万，所以他不能通过挥金如土来引起关注。他说，有一次，为了吸引公众的注意力，他曾设法在东边的一个小公共广场上种了大蒜，免费供穷人取用；但是卡内基听说了，立即在上面盖了一所盖尔语的图书馆。他曾经三次跳到汽车前；但是唯一的结果是弄断了五根肋骨，报纸上的一条简讯说，一个身高五英尺十英寸、有四颗牙齿补过的无名氏，据说是臭名昭著的‘红头发利里’火车劫匪帮的最后成员，被车撞了。","“And then he tells me, you know, the kind of man he was.He was a New Yorker.His whole ambition was to be noticed.He wanted to be conspicuous.He wanted people to point him out and bow to him, and tell others who he was.He said it had been the desire of his life always.He didn’t have but a million, so he couldn’t attract attention by spending money.He said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor; but Carnegie heard of it, and covered it over at once with a library in the Gaelic language.Three times he had jumped in the way of automobiles; but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an unknown man, five feet ten, with four amalgam-filled teeth, supposed to be the last of the famous Red Leary gang had been run over."
"“‘有没有试过记者这条路子？’我问他。","“‘Ever try the reporters,’ I asked him."
"“‘上个月，’沃克劳斯回答，‘我在请记者吃午饭这档子事上的开销是一百二十四美元八十美分。’","“‘Last month,’ says Mr. Vaucross, ‘my expenditure for lunches to reporters was $124.80.’ "
"“‘有收获吗？’我问。","“‘Get anything out of that?’ I asks."
"“‘你提醒了我，’他说，‘另加八美元五十美分的消化素。是啊，真是令我消化不良。’","“‘That reminds me,’ says he; ‘add $8.50 for pepsin.Yes, I got indigestion.’ "
"“‘我应该怎样帮你炒作成名呢？’我问道，‘对比？’","“‘How am I supposed to push along your scramble for prominence?’ I inquires.‘Contrast?’ "
"“‘大概就是这种法子，今晚看看吧，’沃克劳斯说，‘这使我痛苦；但我不得不借助这种古怪行为。’说到这儿，他把餐巾丢到了汤里，站了起来，向房间那头一个正在棕榈树下享用土豆的绅士鞠了一躬。","“‘Something of that sort to-night,’ says Vaucross.‘It grieves me; but I am forced to resort to eccentricity.’And here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room."
"“‘他是警察局长。’我踊跃高攀的同伴得意地说。‘伙计，’我急忙说，‘你可以有野心，但是不要过河拆桥。当你利用我、把我作为一块垫脚石来向你的警察局长献殷勤时，你让我倒胃口，因为我的身份被贬低了、我遭人唾弃了。你好好想想吧。’","“‘The Police Commissioner,’ says my climber, gratified.‘Friend’, says I, in a hurry, ‘have ambitions but don’t kick a rung out of your ladder.When you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that I may be degraded and incriminated.Be thoughtful.’ "
"“吃费城的雉鸡砂锅时，我想到了阿尔泰米西娅·布莱。","“At the Quaker City squab en casserole the idea about Artemisia Blye comes to me."
"“‘假设我能让你成功上报，’我说，‘所有报纸每天一两个专栏，大部分报纸刊登你的照片，一直持续一周。你愿意出多少？’","“‘Suppose I can manage to get you in the papers,’ says I—‘a column or two every day in all of ’em and your picture in most of ’em for a week.How much would it be worth to you?’ "
"“‘一万美元。’沃克劳斯立刻兴奋地答道。‘但是不能是谋杀，’他说，‘也不能让我在交际舞会上穿粉红色内裤。’","“‘Ten thousand dollars,’ says Vaucross, warm in a minute.‘But no murder,’ says he; ‘and I won’t wear pink pants at a cotillon.’ "
"“‘我不会让你这么做的，’我说，‘这是一件荣耀、时尚、没有女人气的事。叫服务员来一小杯咖啡和一些别的豆子，我将向你透露操作过程。’","“‘I wouldn’t ask you to,’ says I.‘This is honorable, stylish and uneffeminate.Tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans, and I will disclose to you the opus moderandi.’ "
"“一小时之后，我们在华丽喧闹的餐馆谈妥了这笔交易。那晚，我给在萨莱纳市的阿尔泰米西娅小姐发了一份电报。第二天早晨，她带上几张照片和一封亲笔信去找了第四长老教会的长老，得到了些车费和八十美元现金。她在托皮卡稍作停留，用一张闪光灯拍摄成的内景照还有一张情人节卡片与一家信托公司的副总裁换了一本火车票簿和一包标有二百五十美元字样的五美元面额钞。","“We closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room.I telegraphed that night to Miss Artemisia in Salina.She took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the Fourth Presbyterian Church in the morning, and got some transportation and $80.She stopped in Topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vice-president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five-dollar notes with $250 scrawled on the band."
"“在接到电报后的第五个晚上，她就盛装打扮、袒胸露肩，等我和沃克劳斯带她去纽约一家女子公寓里吃晚餐，这种公寓一般男性进不来，除非他会玩比齐克牌并抽含脱毛剂的烟。","“The fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting, all décolletée and dressed up, for me and Vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these New York feminine apartment houses where a man can’t get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder cigarettes."
"“‘她很惊艳，’沃克劳斯见到她时说，‘他们一定会给她两栏篇幅的。’","“‘She’s a stunner,’ says Vaucross when he saw her.‘They’ll give her a two-column cut sure.’ "
"“这是我们三人共同策划的方案。它纯属商业性质。沃克劳斯要尽己所能、以流行的方式、张扬地、充满热情地追求布莱小姐一个月。当然，与他的雄心相比，那不算什么。一个打白领结、穿浅口漆皮鞋的男人在身材高挑、婀娜多姿、金发碧眼的女郎身上花大量的钱，给她买营养品和三色堇，这种现象在纽约很常见，就像是得了震颤性谵妄症的人总看到蓝色乌龟一样。但是他要给她写情书——最俗套的那种，就像你妻子在你去世后公诸于众的那种情书一样——每天都写。月底的时候，他会甩掉她，她将起诉，索赔违约赔偿金十万美元。","“This was the scheme the three of us concocted.It was business straight through.Vaucross was to rush Miss Blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a month.Of course, that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned.The sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall, willowy blondes in New York is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens.But he was to write her love letters—the worst kind of love letters, such as your wife publishes after you are dead—every day.At the end of the month he was to drop her, and she would bring suit for $100,000 for breach of promise."
"“阿尔泰米西娅小姐将得到一万美元。如果她赢了官司，钱就归她；若是输了，她也会拿到钱。他们据此签了份合同。","“Miss Artemisia was to get $10,000.If she won the suit that was all; and if she lost she was to get it anyhow.There was a signed contract to that effect."
"“有时候他们带我一起出去，但次数不多。我适应不了他们相处的方式。她经常拿出他写的那些信，批评它们就像是提货单。","“Sometimes they had me out with ’em, but not often.I couldn’t keep up to their style.She used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading."
"“‘喂，你！’她说，‘你说这东西叫什么——五金商人的外甥得知他的婶婶起了荨麻疹而给他叔叔写的问候信吗？你们这些东部来的笨蛋不会写情书，就像堪萨斯的蚱蜢没听说过拖船是什么玩意一样。“我亲爱的布莱小姐！”——这称呼难道能在你的婚礼蛋糕上装点粉红的糖粒和红色的小糖鸟吗？在法庭上，你打算用那种东西吸引观众多久？如果你想要聚光灯聚焦在你那稀疏的灰白头发上，你就要认真对待这件事，喊我“小甜心”和“忍冬花”，并在信尾署名“妈妈的淘气的大孩子”。信要充满情谊。'","“‘Say, you!’ she’d say.‘What do you call this—letter to a Hardware Merchant from His Nephew on Learning that His Aunt Has Nettlerash?You Eastern duffers know as much about writing love letters as a Kansas grasshopper does about tugboats.“My dear Miss Blye!”—wouldn’t that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake?How long do you expect to hold an audience in a court-room with that kind of stuff?You want to get down to business, and call me “Tweedlums Babe” and “Honeysuckle,” and sign yourself “Mama’s Own Big Bad Puggy Wuggy Boy” if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs.Get sappy.’ "
"“之后，沃克劳斯的钢笔如蘸上了塔巴斯科辣酱油，他笔下的文字令人印象深刻。他的情书在原来的基础上有了新意。我能够想象到陪审团坐得笔直，女人们都互相扯了扯帽子，以准备听法院宣读作为物证的情书。我也能够想象沃克劳斯先生声名远扬，就像克兰默大主教、布鲁克林大桥那样出名，或者就如同沙拉奶酪一样受人喜爱和欣赏。他看起来似乎对前景很满意。","“After that Vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco.His notes read like something or other in the original.I could see a jury sitting up, and women tearing one another’s hats to hear ’em read.And I could see piling up for Mr. Vaucross as much notoriousness as Archbishop Cranmer or the Brooklyn Bridge or cheese-on-salad ever enjoyed.He seemed mighty pleased at the prospects."
"“他们在一个晚上约好；我站在第五大街一家庄重典雅的饭店外看着他们。法院的传票使者走了进来，把相关文件递到沃克劳斯的桌子上。每个人都看着他们；他看起来就像古罗马演说家西塞罗那么骄傲。我回到我的房间，点燃一支五美分的雪茄，因为我知道那一万美元十有八九是我们的了。","“They agreed on a night; and I stood on Fifth Avenue outside a solemn restaurant and watched ’em.A process-server walked in and handed Vaucross the papers at his table.Everybody looked at ’em; and he looked as proud as Cicero.I went back to my room and lit a five-cent cigar, for I knew the $10,000 was as good as ours."
"“大约两小时后，有人来敲门。门外站着沃克劳斯和阿尔泰米西娅小姐，她紧紧地抱着——是的，紧紧地抱着——他的胳膊。他们告诉我，他们已经去教堂结婚了。他们明确地说了一些与爱情有关的、有点诗意的话。他们在桌子上放了一个包裹，道了声‘晚安’就离开了。","“About two hours later somebody knocked at my door.There stood Vaucross and Miss Artemisia, and she was clinging—yes, sir, clinging—to his arm.And they tells me they’d been out and got married.And they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such.And they laid down a bundle on the table and said ‘Good night’ and left."
"“那就是为什么我说，”弗格森·波格总结道，“女人太忙于她的天职和对骗局的直觉，例如自我保护和娱乐消遣，以至于不能在特殊骗局方面获得巨大成就。”","“And that’s why I say,” concluded Ferguson Pogue, “that a woman is too busy occupied with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for self-preservation and amusement to make any great success in special lines.”"
"“他们留在桌上的包里放着什么？”我带着我一贯的好奇问道。","“What was in the bundle that they left?”I asked, with my usual curiosity."
"“嗨，”弗格森说，“是一张去堪萨斯城的黄牛火车票和两条沃克劳斯先生的旧裤子。”","“Why,” said Ferguson, “there was a scalper’s railroad ticket as far as Kansas City and two pairs of Mr. Vaucross’s old pants.”"
