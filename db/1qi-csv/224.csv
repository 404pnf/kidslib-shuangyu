"海盗基德","Kidd The Pirate"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文","by Washington Irving"
"从前，在国王查理二世刚把新尼德兰一带从荷兰议会议员大人的手里夺过来、地方上还不大太平的时候，这个州可以说是各种各样的探险家，尤其是海盗最喜爱聚集的地方。这群海盗真是穷凶极恶的掠夺者，他们在和平时期，也敢打劫西班牙殖民地和西班牙商船。海盗利用曼哈托斯港口容易进出，政府毫无组织、法纪松弛的特点，将这一带变成了他们的聚合地。他们在此地分赃，并商量新的劫掠手段。成群的亡命之徒从各个国家和地方逃亡而来，在光天化日之下，在小城镇的街道上，大摇大摆地走来走去，用胳膊肘推开安静的荷兰人，把他们抢来的贵重的外国东西按半价卖给精明的商人，然后把赃款挥霍在酒馆里，他们在那里喝酒、赌博、唱歌、咒骂、吆喝，甚至突然大喊大叫、像暴徒般寻欢作乐，令周围的居民非常震惊。","In old times, just after the territory of the New Netherlands had been wrested from the hands of their High Mightinesses, the Lords States General of Holland, by Charles the Second, and while it was as yet in an unquiet state, the province was a favorite resort of adventurers of all kinds, and particularly of buccaneers.These were piratical rovers of the deep, who made sad work in times of peace among the Spanish settlements and Spanish merchant ships.They took advantage of the easy access to the harbor of the Manhattoes, and of the laxity of its scarcely-organized government, to make it a kind of rendezvous, where they might dispose of their ill-gotten spoils, and concert new depredations.Crews of these desperadoes, the runagates of every country and clime, might be seen swaggering, in open day, about the streets of the little burgh; elbowing its quiet Mynheers; trafficking away their rich outlandish plunder, at half price, to the wary merchant, and then squandering their gains in taverns; drinking, gambling, singing, swearing, shouting, and astounding the neighborhood with sudden brawl and ruffian revelry."
"最后，政府愤怒了，当局就决定把这一窝害虫从殖民地搜出来、撵出去。法律开始制裁他们，这在海盗中间引起了很大的恐慌，他们经常出没的老巢变成了危险之地。他们把自己的赃款和珠宝秘密地藏在偏远无人的地方，把它们埋在人迹稀少的河边和海岸边，自己则逃亡到全国各地。","At length the indignation of government was aroused, and it was determined to ferret out this vermin brood from the colonies.Great consternation took place among the pirates on finding justice in pursuit of them, and their old haunts turned to places of peril.They secreted their money and jewels in lonely out-of-the-way places; buried them about the wild shores of the rivers and sea-coast, and dispersed themselves over the face of the country."
"在政府招来的、由海路追捕他们的探员中，有一位就是著名的基德船长。他一向都是个能吃苦耐劳的冒险家、可疑的边境居民，像是个商人，又像是个走私犯，身上还带有少许不惹人厌的海盗气息。他曾经驾着一只轻便的小快艇，潜伏在海上，和海盗做了一阵子生意。他总是在各种奇异的地方打探消息，像狂风中海燕的雏儿一样奔忙。","Among the agents employed to hunt them by sea was the renowned Captain Kidd.He had long been a hardy adventurer, a kind of equivocal borderer, half trader, half smuggler, with a tolerable dash of the pickaroon.He had traded for some time among the pirates, lurking about the seas in a little rakish, mosquito-built vessel, prying into all kinds of odd places, as busy as a Mother Carey’s chicken in a gale of wind."
"当时，政府选上这么一位难以形容的人物指挥装备齐全的船舰去追捕海盗，就是因为他知道海盗的聚居地和隐藏地，用那句很睿智的古语说就是“用强盗捕捉强盗”。因此，基德乘着装备精良、整装待发的“冒险号”战舰从纽约启航，进而将船驶向马德拉群岛、博纳维斯塔岛和马达加斯加岛，并且航行在红海的入口附近。然而，他非但没有去和海盗开战，反而变成了海盗中的一员：抓捕朋友或敌人；俘获了一艘阔气的大商船，那上面的水手全是摩尔人，但船长却是一个英国人。在卖掉了他的赃物以后，基德又大胆地回到了波士顿，而且带来了满船的财富和一群跟在他后面的党羽。","This nondescript personage was pitched upon by government as the very man to command a vessel fitted out to cruise against the pirates, since he knew all their haunts and lurking-places: acting upon the shrewd old maxim of “setting a rogue to catch a rogue.”Kidd accordingly sailed from New York in the Adventure galley, gallantly armed and duly commissioned, and steered his course to the Madeiras, to Bonavista, to Madagascar, and cruised at the entrance of the Red Sea.Instead, however, of making war upon the pirates, he turned pirate himself: captured friend or foe; enriched himself with the spoils of a wealthy Indiaman, manned by Moors, though commanded by an Englishman, and having disposed of his prize, had the hardihood to return to Boston, laden with wealth, with a crew of his comrades at his heels."
"他已经名声在外。当局发出警报称，他这个海上的盗贼再次横行海上。当局采取措施，准备捉拿这个海盗。但据说，他还有时间埋好他大部分的金银珠宝。他在被捕的时候，甚至还企图抽出他的剑来保护自己，但最后还是被逮到，同他的几个党羽一起被关进了大牢。一艘快速战舰把他们送到英国，在那里，他们受到了审讯、被判了刑，并被绞死在行刑码头上。基德死时受了很大的折磨。一开始用来吊他的绳子因为承受不了他的体重，他一上去就断了，结果他摔到了地上。接着，他又第二次上了绞架，这一次才奏效。那个关于基德被绞死两次的传说，应该是这样来的。","His fame had preceded him.The alarm was given of the reappearance of this cut-purse of the ocean.Measures were taken for his arrest; but he had time, it is said, to bury the greater part of his treasures.He even attempted to draw his sword and defend himself when arrested; but was secured and thrown into prison, with several of his followers.They were carried to England in a frigate, where they were tried, condemned, and hanged at Execution Dock.Kidd died hard, for the rope with which he was first tied up broke with his weight, and he tumbled to the ground; he was tied up a second time, and effectually; from whence arose the story of his having been twice hanged."
"这就是关于海盗基德的故事的梗概，但它后来却引起了无数的传说。他在航行回来之后埋过大量金银珠宝的那个情节，使得沿海一带所有老实人的头脑都发热了。在这儿那儿发现大量金钱的谣言一个接着一个。有时人们会说在国家的这一带发现了金子，有时又说在那一带发现了金子；有着神秘记号的树木和岩石无疑暗示着珠宝埋藏的地点；有的钱币上还发现了摩尔人的文字，分明是基德从东方抢来的赃款，但是普通百姓瞧见它们，却认为这些摩尔文字是一种恶毒的符咒，或本身就附有魔力。","Such is the main outline of Kidd’s history; but it has given birth to an innumerable progeny of traditions.The circumstance of his having buried great treasures of gold and jewels after returning from his cruising set the brains of all the good people along the coast in a ferment.There were rumors on rumors of great sums found here and there; sometimes in one part of the country, sometimes in another; of trees and rocks bearing mysterious marks, doubtless indicating the spots where treasure lay hidden; of coins found with Moorish characters, the plunder of Kidd’s eastern prize, but which the common people took for diabolical or magic inscriptions."
"有些人说，赃物埋在普利茅斯和科德角半岛附近偏僻无人的地方。东海岸的许多其他部分，还有长岛的许多地方都被这些谣言镀上了一层金光，被爱冒险的掘金者洗劫一空。","Some reported the spoils to have been buried in solitary unsettled places about Plymouth and Cape Cod; many other parts of the Eastern coast, also, and various places in Long Island Sound, have been gilded by these rumors, and have been ransacked by adventurous money-diggers."
"在所有这些关于冒险精神的故事里，魔鬼都扮演着显眼的角色。有的人用仪式和祈祷取得了他的谅解，有的人还和他订立了协议和条约。不过，他必定还是会和那些掘金的人玩狡猾的诡计。有些人成功地掘到了有珠宝的铁箱子，但是一定会有令人疑惑的事件发生。不是地面突然下陷，填上了坑，就是出现了一些可怕的噪音或者鬼魂，吓得在场的人惊慌失措、四处逃散；有时候，魔鬼还会亲自显灵，把那些人刚刚到手的横财抢走；可是，如果第二天他们再到那地方，就发现那儿没有他们昨夜辛苦劳作的一丝痕迹。","In all the stories of these enterprises the devil played a conspicuous part.Either he was conciliated by ceremonies and invocations, or some bargain or compact was made with him.Still he was sure to play the money-diggers some slippery trick.Some had succeeded so far as to touch the iron chest which contained the treasure, when some baffling circumstance was sure to take place.Either the earth would fall in and fill up the pit or some direful noise or apparition would throw the party into a panic and frighten them from the place; and sometimes the devil himself would appear and bear off the prize from their very grasp; and if they visited the place on the next day, not a trace would be seen of their labors of the preceding night."
"这些模糊不清的谣言，长期以来引诱着我，却不能满足我对这些海盗趣闻的好奇心。世界上没有什么比真相更难得到的了。","Such were the vague rumors which for a long time tantalized without gratifying my curiosity on the interesting subject of these pirate traditions.There is nothing in this world so hard to get at as truth."
"我从我最喜爱的来源中寻找真正的信息，也就是那些最老的住户，尤其是州里的荷兰老妇。尽管我可以毫不客气地说，关于故乡的古怪传说，我比大部分的人知道得多，然而，经过了很长的时间，我仍然没有打听出实质性的结果。","I sought among my favorite sources of authentic information, the oldest inhabitants, and particularly the old Dutch wives of the province; but though I flatter myself I am better versed than most men in the curious history of my native province, yet for a long time my inquiries were unattended with any substantial result."
"最后，在夏末一个宁静的日子，我来到小时候最喜欢去的那片水域，钓了一天的鱼作为消遣，来放松紧张工作之后疲惫的身心。我和故乡几位可敬的人物一起去的。我们的消遣没什么意思，那些鱼都不肯随随便便地上钩。我们频繁地换钓鱼的地方，但运气也没好到哪里。最后，我们把船停靠在曼哈他岛东海岸突出的岩石下面，这是一个安静、暖和的日子。溪水在我们身边打着漩涡、泛着涟漪，不过没有波浪，甚至连半点波纹都没有，一切都是那样平静、安宁。因此，当我们看到一只翠鸟从一棵枯树的树枝上倒冲下来，在空中盘旋一会儿，看准目标，然后突然扑到平静的水面上去捕捉猎物的时候，几乎吓了一跳。我们懒散地靠在船上，那温暖沉寂的天气和乏味的运动弄得我们昏昏欲睡。我们当中的一位可敬的市议员困得不得了，当他打盹的时候，他钓竿上的铅垂就沉到河底去了。醒来之后，他觉得自己吊到了重要的东西，因为分量很重。等到把它拉出水面时，我们都诧异极了，原来是一支很古怪的、外国造的长手枪，从它生锈的样子和破烂不堪、布满藤壶的枪柄来判断，它好像在水下呆了很长时间。意外地发现了这么一件战争纪念物，这引起了我那些爱好和平的同伴们的诸多猜想。有一位猜想它是在革命战争时期掉下去的。另一位认为，从它古怪的式样来看，它可能属于殖民初期的航海家，说不定是大名鼎鼎的艾德里安·布洛克的遗物。当初他在桑德湾一带探险，并且发现了后来以乳酪闻名的布洛克岛。但第三位瞧了一会儿以后，却认定它是名副其实的西班牙工艺制成的。","At length it happened, one calm day in the latter part of summer, that I was relaxing myself from the toils of severe study by a day’s amusement in fishing in those waters which had been the favorite resort of my boyhood.I was in company with several worthy burghers of my native city.Our sport was indifferent; the fish did not bite freely; and we had frequently changed our fishing ground without bettering our luck.We were at length anchored close under a ledge of rocky coast, on the eastern side of the island of Manhata.It was a still, warm day.The stream whirled and dimpled by us without a wave or even a ripple, and every thing was so calm and quiet that it was almost startling when the kingfisher would pitch himself from the branch of some dry tree, and after suspending himself for a moment in the air to take his aim, would souse into the smooth water after his prey.While we were lolling in our boat, half drowsy with the warm stillness of the day and the dullness of our sport, one of our party, a worthy alderman, was overtaken by a slumber, and, as he dozed, suffered the sinker of his drop-line to lie upon the bottom of the river.On waking, he found he had caught something of importance, from the weight; on drawing it to the surface, we were much surprised to find a long pistol of very curious and outlandish fashion, which, from its rusted condition, and its stock being worm-eaten and covered with barnacles, appeared to have been a long time under water.The unexpected appearance of this document of warfare occasioned much speculation among my pacific companions.One supposed it to have fallen there during the revolutionary war.Another, from the peculiarity of its fashion, attributed it to the voyagers in the earliest days of the settlement; perchance to the renowned Adrian Block, who explored the Sound and discovered Block Island, since so noted for its cheese.But a third, after regarding it for some time, pronounced it to be of veritable Spanish workmanship."
"“我敢保证，”他说，“如果这支手枪会说话的话，它一定会讲出许多奇怪的、西班牙贵族之间激战的故事。我可以毫不怀疑地说，它一定是古时海盗的遗物。”","“I’ll warrant,” said he, “if this pistol could talk it would tell strange stories of hard fights among the Spanish Dons.I’ve not a doubt but it’s a relique of the buccaneers of old times.”"
"“真的很像，”另一个人说，“那时候，布雷迪什地区有一个在海盗，在贝拉蒙特大人因海盗制造了很大轰动之后，他将钱和珠宝埋在了这些地方或长岛上。然后，便有了基德船长——”","“Like enough,” said another of the party.“There was Bradish the pirate, who at the time Lord Bellamont made such a stir after the buccaneers, buried money and jewels somewhere in these parts or on Long-Island; and then there was Captain Kidd—”"
"“嘿！基德那家伙可真是个大胆的家伙，”一个面色严峻的科德角的捕鲸人说道，“从前还有一支关于他的挺不错的老歌，里面尽唱些：","“Ah, that Kidd was a daring dog,” said an iron-faced Cape Cod whaler.“There’s a fine old song about him, all to the tune of:"
"‘我叫罗伯特·基德，我要扬帆起航哟，我要扬帆起航哟。’","‘My name is Robert Kidd,As I sailed, as I sailed.’"
"后来又讲到了他如何埋下圣经以讨好魔鬼的：","And it tells how he gained the devil’s good graces by burying the Bible:"
"‘我手里拿着这本圣经，我要扬起帆哟，我要扬起帆哟，我把它埋在了沙里，我扬帆起航哦。’","‘I had the Bible in my hand,As I sailed, as I sailed,And I buried it in the sand,As I sailed.’"
"哎呀！要是这支手枪是基德用过的，即便是出于纯粹的好奇，我也要好好重视它。啊，对了，我听说了一个有关汤姆·沃克的古怪故事，据说他曾经挖出过一些基德埋的钱财，看起来鱼现在不会上钩，我就给你们讲一讲，权当是一种消遣吧。”","Egad, if this pistol had belonged to him I should set some store by it out of sheer curiosity.Ah, well, there’s an odd story I have heard about one Tom Walker, who, they say, dug up some of Kidd’s buried money; and as the fish don’t seem to bite at present, I’ll tell it to you to pass away time.”"
