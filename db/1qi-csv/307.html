		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在巴黎，你一定见过不少这样的人，他们汇聚在这个城市的某个中心区域，既有思想又有学识，彼此之间有着某些相似之处。我们即将认识的这位拉布丹先生就与他们十分相像，他此时正在政府最重要的一个部门里任处长。此时他四十岁，女人一见到他那一头颜色深浅恰到好处的灰发，就忍不住会迷恋上它，因为这头发舒缓了他略带忧郁的面容。他的眼睛蓝盈盈似有火光流转，皮肤还算白皙，只不过脸上星星点点地生了些鲜艳的红斑。他长着路易十五那样的额头和鼻子，嘴角露出严肃的神情，身材高挑单薄，也许可以说是羸弱，似乎他刚刚大病初愈。最后一点，他的举止有些不伦不类，介于懒汉的游手好闲和忙人的深思熟虑之间。如果说这幅肖像画描绘出了他的特点，那么对他衣着做一番速写将更能凸显他的特质。拉布丹先生习惯穿一件蓝色外套，打一条白色领带，上身穿罗伯斯比尔马甲，下身着没有背带的黑色长裤，脚上则套着灰色丝袜、蹬着平底鞋。他刮净胡渣，喝杯咖啡暖了暖胃，八点出门去部里上班，每天都像上了发条一般准时，连路过的街道也总是同样那几条。他的外表是如此整洁、正统、刻板，以至于人们会把他当成正往使馆走的英国佬。</td>
		<td class="en">In Paris, where men of thought and study bear a certain likeness to one another, living as they do in a common centre, you must have met with several resembling Monsieur Rabourdin, whose acquaintance we are about to make at a moment when he is head of a bureau in one of our most important ministries.At this period he was forty years old, with gray hair of so pleasing a shade that women might at a pinch fall in love with it for it softened a somewhat melancholy countenance, blue eyes full of fire, a skin that was still fair, though rather ruddy and touched here and there with strong red marks; a forehead and nose a la Louis XV., a serious mouth, a tall figure, thin, or perhaps wasted, like that of a man just recovering from illness, and finally, a bearing that was midway between the indolence of a mere idler and the thoughtfulness of a busy man.If this portrait serves to depict his character, a sketch of this man’s dress will bring it still further into relief.Rabourdin wore habitually a blue surcoat, a white cravat, a waistcoat crossed a la Robespierre, black trousers without straps, gray silk stockings and low shoes.Well-shaved, and with his stomach warmed by a cup of coffee, he left home at eight in the morning with the regularity of clock-work, always passing along the same streets on his way to the ministry: so neat was he, so formal, so starched that he might have been taken for an Englishman on the road to his embassy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从这些总体印象中，你可以很容易地看出，他是一个有家室的男人，既要被家庭琐事所困扰，又要因部里的公务而忧心。但他却像哲学家一般豁达，对待生活顺其自然。他为人诚恳，热爱祖国并为之效力，坚持正义并坦然面对困难；他深谙人性，处世谨慎；他对女人谦恭有礼，却毫无所求。总而言之，他是一个有才干的人，对下属非常和蔼，与同级保持距离，对上司不卑不亢。在本文所描写的那段时期，你会注意到他神情冷漠，又逆来顺受。他已掩埋了年轻时的种种幻想，放弃了每一个潜藏的抱负。你会发现一个气馁但还未厌世的人，他仍坚守着最初的事业——他大概更想发挥自己的才智，而不是对没有把握的成功抱有希望。他不佩戴任何勋章。他在复辟早期戴过旧时法国王室纹章，他认为这是自己怯懦无能的表现，总为此自责不已。</td>
		<td class="en">From these general signs you will readily discern a family man, harassed by vexations in his own household, worried by annoyances at the ministry, yet philosopher enough to take life as he found it; an honest man, loving his country and serving it, not concealing from himself the obstacles in the way of those who seek to do right; prudent, because he knew men; exquisitely courteous with women, of whom he asked nothing,—a man full of acquirements, affable with his inferiors, holding his equals at great distance, and dignified towards his superiors.At the epoch of which we write, you would have noticed in him the coldly resigned air of one who has buried the illusions of his youth and renounced every secret ambition; you would have recognized a discouraged, but not disgusted man, one who still clings to his first projects,—more perhaps to employ his faculties than in the hope of a doubtful success.He was not decorated with any order, and always accused himself of weakness for having worn that of the Fleur-de-lis in the early days of the Restoration.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个人物的生活被烙上了某些独特而又神秘的印记。他从未见过父亲；他的母亲奢华成性，总是衣着华贵，乘车赴宴。在他眼中，母亲美若天仙，但他很少能见她一面。她死时几乎没有给他留下任何东西。尽管她让他受过教育，但这种教育太过普通，又不够完整，使得他眼高手低、志大才疏。母亲去世前的几天，他离开了拿破仑中学，以临时雇员的身份进入政府部门工作，那时他才刚刚十六岁。这份差事是由一位他从未谋面的保护人替他谋到的。拉布丹二十二岁就当上了副处长，二十五岁便被提升为处长，也就是办事处的领导。从那以后，在他人生起步时曾帮助过他的那只援手就再也没有扶持过他的仕途。除了仅有的一次，那只手将他这个既穷酸又没什么朋友的年轻人领进了勒普兰斯先生的家门。这位先生曾经是位拍卖商，已经丧偶，据说极为富有，只有一个独生女儿。格扎维埃·拉布丹疯狂地爱上了塞莱斯蒂纳·勒普兰斯小姐。勒普兰斯小姐当时芳龄十七岁，拥有整整二十万法郎的嫁妆。她的母亲很有艺术天分。在她的精心教养下，这位年轻的淑女继承了母亲的多才多艺，足以吸引杰出男士的注意。她高挑俊俏、身段优美，在音乐方面很有造诣。她会画铅笔画，会画油画，还能说好几种语言，甚至略懂些科学知识——这可是个危险的长处，女人有了这种知识，就必须谨慎小心，以免落个故意卖弄的嫌疑。她娇弱温柔，尽管这并不真实，却蒙蔽了她母亲的双眼，致使她对女儿灌输了种种有关前途的错误想法。在母亲眼里，只有公爵大使、法兰西的将军或国家大臣，才能给她的塞莱斯蒂纳应有的社会地位。况且这位年轻的淑女无论是从举止、谈吐和习惯上看，都是一副上流社会的派头。她衣着华丽高贵，简直不像未婚女子。她现在什么也不缺，她未来的丈夫能给予她的只有幸福。她的母亲在女儿婚后一年过世，但之前母亲一直纵容她，宠爱她，对她的娇生惯养几乎到了愚蠢的程度，因而想要扮演好她丈夫这一角色难上加难。一个男人需要多么沉着冷静的头脑，才能征服这样的女子！普通男人心怀畏惧、望而却步，不敢向她求婚。格扎维埃无父无母，除了在政府里尚有一官半职之外，他也没什么财产。塞莱斯蒂纳的父亲向女儿推荐这个年轻人。她很久都没有答应，倒不是因为她对这位年轻俊朗、对自己又情有独钟的追求者有任何反感。她踌躇不前，是因为拉布丹夫人这个称谓毫不起眼。勒普兰斯先生向女儿保证，格扎维埃先生是块做政治家的料。塞莱斯蒂纳则回答说，一个姓拉布丹的人永远不会在波旁王朝出人头地，等等。她的父亲迫于无奈，犯了一个严重错误。他告诉女儿，她未来的丈夫在没达到获准入阁年龄之前，就一定能成为拉布丹·“德某某”之类的 。格扎维埃很快就将被任命为他所在部门的稽查长和秘书长。从这些底层职位做起，这个年轻人一定能青云直上，担当政府里更高层的职位。勒普兰斯先生还知道有这样一份遗嘱，格扎维埃将从中继承一笔遗产和一个尊贵的姓氏。此话一出，这桩婚事就谈成了。</td>
		<td class="en">The life of this man was marked by certain mysterious peculiarities.He had never known his father; his mother, a woman to whom luxury was everything, always elegantly dressed, always on pleasure bent, whose beauty seemed to him miraculous and whom he very seldom saw, left him little at her death; but she had given him that too common and incomplete education which produces so much ambition and so little ability.A few days before his mother’s death, when he was just sixteen, he left the Lycee Napoleon to enter as supernumerary a government office, where an unknown protector had provided him with a place.At twenty-two years of age Rabourdin became under-head-clerk; at twenty-five, head-clerk, or, as it was termed, head of the bureau.From that day the hand that assisted the young man to start in life was never felt again in his career, except as to a single circumstance; it led him, poor and friendless, to the house of a Monsieur Leprince, formerly an auctioneer, a widower said to be extremely rich, and father of an only daughter.Xavier Rabourdin fell desperately in love with Mademoiselle Celestine Leprince, then seventeen years of age, who had all the matrimonial claims of a dowry of two hundred thousand francs.Carefully educated by an artistic mother, who transmitted her own talents to her daughter, this young lady was fitted to attract distinguished men.Tall, handsome, and finely-formed, she was a good musician, drew and painted, spoke several languages, and even knew something of science,—a dangerous advantage, which requires a woman to avoid carefully all appearance of pedantry.Blinded by mistaken tenderness, the mother gave the daughter false ideas as to her probable future; to the maternal eyes a duke or an ambassador, a marshal of France or a minister of State, could alone give her Celestine her due place in society.The young lady had, moreover, the manners, language, and habits of the great world.Her dress was richer and more elegant than was suitable for an unmarried girl; a husband could give her nothing more than she now had, except happiness.Besides all such indulgences, the foolish spoiling of the mother, who died a year after the girl’s marriage, made a husband’s task all the more difficult.What coolness and composure of mind were needed to rule such a woman!Commonplace suitors held back in fear.Xavier Rabourdin, without parents and without fortune other than his situation under government, was proposed to Celestine by her father.She resisted for a long time; not that she had any personal objection to her suitor, who was young, handsome, and much in love, but she shrank from the plain name of Madame Rabourdin.Monsieur Leprince assured his daughter that Xavier was of the stock that statesmen came of.Celestine answered that a man named Rabourdin would never be anything under the government of the Bourbons, etc.Forced back to his intrenchments, the father made the serious mistake of telling his daughter that her future husband was certain of becoming Rabourdin “de something or other” before he reached the age of admission to the Chamber.Xavier was soon to be appointed Master of petitions, and general-secretary at his ministry.From these lower steps of the ladder the young man would certainly rise to the higher ranks of the administration, possessed of a fortune and a name bequeathed to him in a certain will of which he, Monsieur Leprince, was cognizant.On this the marriage took place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老拍卖商对那位神秘保护人只是略提了一下，但拉布丹和他的妻子都很信任这位保护人。这对夫妇一直盲目地怀着这种希冀，两人感情又好，自然用起钱来也大手大脚，婚后头五年就花掉了近十万法郎。五年后，塞莱斯蒂纳因看不到丈夫有任何晋升的动静，心里绷紧了弦，于是坚持把剩余的十万法郎嫁妆投到了地产业里，结果收益甚微。不过，将来她能从父亲那里继承到遗产，那足以弥补当前的窘困，让他们夫妇过上舒适无比的宽裕日子。他们对那位不知名的保护人寄予的希望破灭了。可敬的拍卖商见女婿未能得志，又看在女儿的份上，冒险用自己的一部分资产做了一笔很有可能获利的投机生意，试图弥补这份秘密的损失。但这个可怜人被牵扯进了纽沁根公司的一次清算倒闭中，最后郁积而终，除了十几幅被他女儿拿来装饰客厅的精美油画和一些被她堆在阁楼里的老式家具以外，没留下任何东西。</td>
		<td class="en">Rabourdin and his wife believed in the mysterious protector to whom the auctioneer alluded.Led away by such hopes and by the natural extravagance of happy love, Monsieur and Madame Rabourdin spent nearly one hundred thousand francs of their capital in the first five years of married life.By the end of this time Celestine, alarmed at the non-advancement of her husband, insisted on investing the remaining hundred thousand francs of her dowry in landed property, which returned only a slender income; but her future inheritance from her father would amply repay all present privations with perfect comfort and ease of life.When the worthy auctioneer saw his son-in-law disappointed of the hopes they had placed on the nameless protector, he tried, for the sake of his daughter, to repair the secret loss by risking part of his fortune in a speculation which had favourable chances of success.But the poor man became involved in one of the liquidations of the house of Nucingen, and died of grief, leaving nothing behind him but a dozen fine pictures which adorned his daughter’s salon, and a few old-fashioned pieces of furniture, which she put in the garret.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拉布丹夫人盼了八年毫无结果后，终于明白丈夫背后的保护人肯定是不在了。至于那份遗嘱，如果确实存在过的话，不是被人弄丢了，就是被人毁了。塞莱斯蒂纳父亲去世的前两年，司长一职曾出现过空缺。他们跳过了她的丈夫，将这一职位给了某个叫德拉比亚尔迪埃的人。这人是某个右派议员的亲戚，而那位议员在一八二三年被任命为大臣。这件事足以让拉布丹辞职而去，可他怎么能放弃八千法郎的官俸和其他各种津贴呢？这可是他总收入的四分之三，他的家人也早已习惯了用这笔收入作开销。况且，如果他能耐着性子再多等几年，就可以领退休金了。她从一开始就对人生抱有很高的期望，这份期望还多多少少有了保证，而且从各方面来讲大家都一致认定她以后会高人一等，对于这样一个女性来说，这可是极为巨大的落差。</td>
		<td class="en">Eight years of fruitless expectation made Madame Rabourdin at last understand that the paternal protector of her husband must have died, and that his will, if it ever existed, was lost or destroyed.Two years before her father’s death the place of chief of division, which became vacant, was given, over her husband’s head, to a certain Monsieur de la Billardiere, related to a deputy of the Right who was made minister in 1823.It was enough to drive Rabourdin out of the service; but how could he give up his salary of eight thousand francs and perquisites, when they constituted three fourths of his income and his household was accustomed to spend them?Besides, if he had patience for a few more years he would then be entitled to a pension.What a fall was this for a woman whose high expectations at the opening of her life were more or less warranted, and one who was admitted on all sides to be a superior woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拉布丹夫人实现了自己还是勒普兰斯小姐时的抱负。她气质高雅、人见人爱；她学识广博，能和不同的人用他们的本国语交谈；她有真才实学，思想独到又有高度；她的言谈富有魅力，内容广泛，充满新奇独到的想法，听者无不感到轻松愉悦。这些素养若为一位王室贵妇或大使夫人拥有，则很相称也很能派得上用场，但对于一个不得不老实持家、平凡度日的主妇来说，则一点用也没有。那些口若悬河的人渴望有听众，即便听他们说话的人有时感到厌烦，他们也乐此不疲。拉布丹夫人为了满足自己的精神需求，每周都会安排一天会客，而且常常出入上流社会，以满足她那颗惯于享乐的自恋之心。了解巴黎生活的人们一下子就能想明白，像她这样性情的女人承受了多少的痛苦，拮据的生活方式又令她的内心受了多少煎熬。无论人们在金钱问题上有过多么愚蠢的声明，所有的人，只要活在巴黎，都必须臣服于账单，敬畏数字，还得亲吻那分叉的金牛犊蹄子。她遇到的可是个大难题啊！一年进账一万二千法郎，用以支付全家人的开销，包括夫妻俩、两个孩子、一个女佣、一个厨子。一大家子人住在迪福街二楼的一间公寓里，房租一年两千法郎。在估算全家总花销之前，得先扣除夫人的服装费、车马费，所有事情在服装面前都得往后靠，然后看看还剩多少可以用于子女教育（女儿八岁，儿子九岁，他们俩的抚养费肯定至少得另花两千法郎）。于是你会看到，每个月拉布丹夫人几乎很难给她丈夫留出三十法郎。这就是巴黎一半丈夫的处境，他们被妻子当作恶棍看待，受着这样的惩罚。</td>
		<td class="en">Madame Rabourdin had justified the expectations formed of Mademoiselle Leprince; she possessed the elements of that apparent superiority which pleases the world; her liberal education enabled her to speak to every one in his or her own language; her talents were real; she showed an independent and elevated mind; her conversation charmed as much by its variety and ease as by the oddness and originality of her ideas.Such qualities, useful and appropriate in a sovereign or an ambassadress, were of little service to a household compelled to jog in the common round.Those who have the gift of speaking well desire an audience; they like to talk, even if they sometimes weary others.To satisfy the requirements of her mind Madame Rabourdin took a weekly reception-day and went a great deal into society to obtain the consideration her self-love was accustomed to enjoy.Those who know Parisian life will readily understand how a woman of her temperament suffered, and was martyrized at heart by the scantiness of her pecuniary means.No matter what foolish declarations people make about money, they one and all, if they live in Paris, must grovel before accounts, do homage to figures, and kiss the forked hoof of the golden calf.What a problem was hers! twelve thousand francs a year to defray the costs of a household consisting of father, mother, two children, a chambermaid and cook, living on the second floor of a house in the rue Duphot, in an apartment costing two thousand francs a year.Deduct the dress and the carriage of Madame before you estimate the gross expenses of the family, for dress precedes everything; then see what remains for the education of the children (a girl of eight and a boy of nine, whose maintenance must cost at least two thousand francs besides) and you will find that Madame Rabourdin could barely afford to give her husband thirty francs a month.That is the position of half the husbands in Paris, under penalty of being thought monsters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个女人相信自己注定要在世上大放异彩，却不得不和一个账本短兵相接，把她的心智与才华用在这样一场卑贱的争斗上。她已经拉下了脸面，做出了很大的牺牲！父亲死后不久，她连男佣都辞了。大多数女性都会被这种日复一日的挣扎拖得疲惫不堪。她们也会抱怨，但最后往往会向命运投降，接受现实。塞莱斯蒂纳的抱负非但没有减退，反而在困难面前愈挫愈强。当困难难以克服时，她就把困难统统丢到一边、不予理会。在她看来，这些生活琐事就像戈尔迪打的结一样，纠缠在一起无法解开，唯有天才才能将其剪断。她决不接受中产阶层的琐碎生活。期待的日子迟迟不来，生活中美好的事情因而不受她的掌控，这使得她怒火中烧，责怪命运欺骗了自己。塞莱斯蒂纳笃信自己是个有过人之处的女性。或许她有道理，或许她在大场合下能成为重要人物，或许她还没有处在适合她的位置上。我们要记住，有多少种男人就会有多少种女人，所有人都由社会塑造，适应着社会的需求。社会法则就像自然法则，自然界里总是嫩芽多过树木，鱼卵多过成鱼。许多才能卓绝的人（比如阿塔纳斯·格朗松）会像石头地上的种子一样，因缺少水的滋润而枯死。无疑，世界上存在着各种各样的女性：有顾家念家的、多才多艺的、充当摆设的，也有专门给人当妻子、母亲、恋人的。有的女性追求纯粹的精神享受，有的则以物质为重，这与不少当士兵、艺术家、工匠、数学家、诗人、商人的男人十分相像。他们或深谙赚钱之道，或明白农业，又或了解政府，对其他事情却一无所知。除此以外，世事无常，人们总会相互误解。应召的如过江之鲫，被选中的却寥寥无几，这既是人间的法则，也是上天的规则。拉布丹夫人认为自己完全有能力引导政治家的前途，激发艺术家的灵感，帮助发明家挖掘兴趣，甚至可以为纽沁根人贡献力量，制定出金融政策，在上流社会大放异彩。或许她只是在极力排遣自己心中的怨恨——洗衣单一张又一张，日常开销的账单不得不盯紧，日子得精打细算着过，房子小还得打理好，这一切都让她怀恨不已。她只有在那些能带给她快乐的事情上，才能得心应手。她的地位深深刺痛了她的心，只有圣劳伦斯上刑架的痛苦才可与之相提并论。所以，她有时候歇斯底里一番又有什么稀奇的呢？就这样，当她备受阻挠的野心突然迸发时，当她屡屡受挫的虚荣心重重击痛她时，塞莱斯蒂纳把怒气撒到格扎维埃·拉布丹头上。为她带来和她相称的身份地位，这难道不是她丈夫的义务吗？如果她是个男人，肯定会振作精神，在很短的时间内赚上一大笔钱，好让自己爱慕的妻子过得幸福！她骂他太老实。这种责骂从某些女人嘴里说出来，就是在说他蠢。她替他制定出了一些非凡的计划，却不考虑那些人为物质因素造成的障碍。接着，她就如同天下所有受激动情绪支配的女性一样，变得如贡德维尔一般懂权术，比马克西姆·德特拉伊还要肆无忌惮。每当这种时候，塞莱斯蒂纳就会心境大开，想象着自己已经实现了种种想法，直登巅峰。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus it was that this woman who believed herself destined to shine in the world was condemned to use her mind and her faculties in a sordid struggle, fighting hand to hand with an account-book.Already, terrible sacrifice of pride! she had dismissed her man-servant, not long after the death of her father.Most women grow weary of this daily struggle; they complain but they usually end by giving up to fate and taking what comes to them; Celestine’s ambition, far from lessening, only increased through difficulties, and led her, when she found she could not conquer them, to sweep them aside.To her mind this complicated tangle of the affairs of life was a Gordian knot impossible to untie and which genius ought to cut.Far from accepting the pettiness of middle-class existence, she was angry at the delay which kept the great things of life from her grasp,—blaming fate as deceptive.Celestine sincerely believed herself a superior woman.Perhaps she was right; perhaps she would have been great under great circumstances; perhaps she was not in her right place.Let us remember there are as many varieties of woman as there are of man, all of which society fashions to meet its needs.Now in the social order, as in Nature’s order, there are more young shoots than there are trees, more spawn than full-grown fish, and many great capacities (Athanase Granson, for instance) which die withered for want of moisture, like seeds on stony ground.There are, unquestionably, household women, accomplished women, ornamental women, women who are exclusively wives, or mothers, or sweethearts, women purely spiritual or purely material; just as there are soldiers, artists, artisans, mathematicians, poets, merchants, men who understand money, or agriculture, or government, and nothing else.Besides all this, the eccentricity of events leads to endless cross-purposes; many are called and few are chosen is the law of earth as of heaven.Madame Rabourdin conceived herself fully capable of directing a statesman, inspiring an artist, helping an inventor and pushing his interests, or of devoting her powers to the financial politics of a Nucingen, and playing a brilliant part in the great world.Perhaps she was only endeavouring to excuse to her own mind a hatred for the laundry lists and the duty of overlooking the housekeeping bills, together with the petty economies and cares of a small establishment.She was superior only in those things where it gave her pleasure to be so.Feeling as keenly as she did the thorns of a position which can only be likened to that of Saint-Laurence on his grid-iron, is it any wonder that she sometimes cried out?So, in her paroxysms of thwarted ambition, in the moments when her wounded vanity gave her terrible shooting pains, Celestine turned upon Xavier Rabourdin.Was it not her husband’s duty to give her a suitable position in the world?If she were a man she would have had the energy to make a rapid fortune for the sake of rendering an adored wife happy!She reproached him for being too honest a man.In the mouth of some women this accusation is a charge of imbecility.She sketched out for him certain brilliant plans in which she took no account of the hindrances imposed by men and things; then, like all women under the influence of vehement feeling, she became in thought as Machiavellian as Gondreville, and more unprincipled than Maxime de Trailles.At such times Celestine’s mind took a wide range, and she imagined herself at the summit of her ideas.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When these fine visions first began Rabourdin, who saw the practical side, was cool.Celestine, much grieved, thought her husband narrow-minded, timid, unsympathetic; and she acquired, insensibly, a wholly false opinion of the companion of her life.In the first place, she often extinguished him by the brilliancy of her arguments.Her ideas came to her in flashes, and she sometimes stopped him short when he began an explanation, because she did not choose to lose the slightest sparkle of her own mind.From the earliest days of their marriage Celestine, feeling herself beloved and admired by her husband, treated him without ceremony; she put herself above conjugal laws and the rules of private courtesy by expecting love to pardon all her little wrong-doings; and, as she never in any way corrected herself, she was always in the ascendant.In such a situation the man holds to the wife very much the position of a child to a teacher when the latter cannot or will not recognize that the mind he has ruled in childhood is becoming mature.Like Madame de Stael, who exclaimed in a room full of people, addressing, as we may say, a greater man than herself, “Do you know you have really said something very profound!”Madame Rabourdin said of her husband: “He certainly has a good deal of sense at times.”Her disparaging opinion of him gradually appeared in her behavior through almost imperceptible motions.Her attitude and manners expressed a want of respect.Without being aware of it she injured her husband in the eyes of others; for in all countries society, before making up its mind about a man, listens for what his wife thinks of him, and obtains from her what the Genevese term “pre-advice.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Placed in a position where he could study French administration and observe its mechanism, Rabourdin worked in the circle where his thought revolved, which, we may remark parenthetically, is the secret of much human accomplishment; and his labor culminated finally in the invention of a new system for the Civil Service of government.Knowing the people with whom he had to do, he maintained the machine as it then worked, so it still works and will continue to work; for everybody fears to remodel it, though no one, according to Rabourdin, ought to be unwilling to simplify it.In his opinion, the problem to be resolved lay in a better use of the same forces.His plan, in its simplest form, was to revise taxation and lower it in a way that should not diminish the revenues of the State, and to obtain, from a budget equal to the budgets which now excite such rabid discussion, results that should be two-fold greater than the present results.Long practical experience had taught Rabourdin that perfection is brought about in all things by changes in the direction of simplicity.To economize is to simplify.To simplify means to suppress unnecessary machinery; removals naturally follow.His system, therefore, depended on the weeding out of officials and the establishment of a new order of administrative offices.No doubt the hatred which all reformers incur takes its rise here.Removals required by this perfecting process, always ill-understood, threaten the well-being of those on whom a change in their condition is thus forced.What rendered Rabourdin really great was that he was able to restrain the enthusiasm that possesses all reformers, and to patiently seek out a slow evolving medium for all changes so as to avoid shocks, leaving time and experience to prove the excellence of each reform.The grandeur of the result anticipated might make us doubt its possibility if we lose sight of this essential point in our rapid analysis of his system.It is, therefore, not unimportant to show through his self-communings, however incomplete they might be, the point of view from which he looked at the administrative horizon.This tale, which is evolved from the very heart of the Civil Service, may also serve to show some of the evils of our present social customs.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Formerly, under the monarchy, the bureaucratic armies did not exist.The clerks, few in number, were under the orders of a prime minister who communicated with the sovereign; thus they directly served the king.The superiors of these zealous servants were simply called head-clerks.In those branches of administration which the king did not himself direct, such for instance as the “fermes” (the public domains throughout the country on which a revenue was levied), the clerks were to their superior what the clerks of a business-house are to their employer; they learned a science which would one day advance them to prosperity.Thus, all points of the circumference were fastened to the centre and derived their life from it.The result was devotion and confidence.Since 1789 the State, call it the Nation if you like, has replaced the sovereign.Instead of looking directly to the chief magistrate of this nation, the clerks have become, in spite of our fine patriotic ideas, the subsidiaries of the government; their superiors are blown about by the winds of a power called “the administration,” and do not know from day to day where they may be on the morrow.As the routine of public business must go on, a certain number of indispensable clerks are kept in their places, though they hold these places on sufferance, anxious as they are to retain them.Bureaucracy, a gigantic power set in motion by dwarfs, was generated in this way.Though Napoleon, by subordinating all things and all men to his will, retarded for a time the influence of bureaucracy (that ponderous curtain hung between the service to be done and the man who orders it), it was permanently organized under the constitutional government, which was, inevitably, the friend of all mediocrities, the lover of authentic documents and accounts, and as meddlesome as an old tradeswoman.Delighted to see the various ministers constantly struggling against the four hundred petty minds of the Elected of the Chamber, with their ten or a dozen ambitious and dishonest leaders, the Civil Service officials hastened to make themselves essential to the warfare by adding their quota of assistance under the form of written action; they created a power of inertia and named it “Report.”Let us explain the Report.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Rabourdin’s plan divided the government into three ministries, or departments.He thought that if the France of former days possessed brains strong enough to comprehend in one system both foreign and domestic affairs, the France of to-day was not likely to be without its Mazarin, its Suger, its Sully, its de Choiseul, or its Colbert to direct even vast administrative departments.Besides, constitutionally speaking, three ministries will agree better than seven; and, in the restricted number there is less chance for mistaken choice; moreover, it might be that the kingdom would some day escape from those perpetual ministerial oscillations which interfered with all plans of foreign policy and prevented all ameliorations of home rule.In Austria, where many diverse united nations present so many conflicting interests to be conciliated and carried forward under one crown, two statesmen alone bear the burden of public affairs and are not overwhelmed by it.Was France less prolific of political capacities than Germany?The rather silly game of what are called “constitutional institutions” carried beyond bounds has ended, as everybody knows, in requiring a great many offices to satisfy the multifarious ambition of the middle classes.It seemed to Rabourdin, in the first place, natural to unite the ministry of war with the ministry of the navy.To his thinking the navy was one of the current expenses of the war department, like the artillery, cavalry, infantry, and commissariat.Surely it was an absurdity to give separate administrations to admirals and marshals when both were employed to one end, namely, the defense of the nation, the overthrow of an enemy, and the security of the national possessions.The ministry of the interior ought in like manner to combine the departments of commerce, police, and finances, or it belied its own name.To the ministry of foreign affairs belonged the administration of justice, the household of the king, and all that concerned arts, sciences, and belles lettres.All patronage ought to flow directly from the sovereign.Such ministries necessitated the supremacy of a council.Each required the work of two hundred officials, and no more, in its central administration offices, where Rabourdin proposed that they should live, as in former days under the monarchy.Taking the sum of twelve thousand francs a year for each official as an average, he estimated seven millions as the cost of the whole body of such officials, which actually stood at twenty in the budget.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >通过将行政机构削减为三个主要部门，他压缩了毫无用处的部门和在巴黎维持这些部门所需的巨额费用。他证明，一个郡可以由十个人管理，一个省则最多需要十二人，这样除去国防部和司法部，整个法国的公务员队伍将被减至五千人。在这份计划里，法庭书记员负责贷款事宜，内政部则负责地产登记和管理。如此一来，拉布丹就把所有性质相关的分支机构合并到了同一个中央部门里。抵押、继承和登记都不会超出各部门的执行范围，只需在法庭和皇宫各额外安排三名公务员即可。这一原则平稳运作，拉布丹便能转而进行财政系统的改革。他将各项税收并入一个渠道，按照消费数额征收消费税，不再征收财产税。在他看来，和平年代唯一可以合理征税的便是消费。国家应该一直保有土地税，以防发生战争，因为只有到那个时候，国土面临危险，国家才可以名正言顺地要求人民为土地做出些牺牲。然而在和平年代，如果土地税征收超过了某个限度，那将成为一个严重的政治失误，因为如遇重大的紧急情况，就没法依赖这项税收了。因此，国泰民安时应公开在市场上发行国债，此时价值与票面等额；发国难时，百分之五十的票面价值都会蒸发掉。打仗时，国家应将征收土地税作为对策。</td>
		<td class="en">By thus reducing the ministers to three heads he suppressed departments which had come to be useless, together with the enormous costs of their maintenance in Paris.He proved that an arrondissement could be managed by ten men; a prefecture by a dozen at the most; which reduced the entire civil service force throughout France to five thousand men, exclusive of the departments of war and justice.Under this plan the clerks of the court were charged with the system of loans, and the ministry of the interior with that of registration and the management of domains.Thus Rabourdin united in one centre all divisions that were allied in nature.The mortgage system, inheritance, and registration did not pass outside of their own sphere of action and only required three additional clerks in the justice courts and three in the royal courts.The steady application of this principle brought Rabourdin to reforms in the finance system.He merged the collection of revenue into one channel, taxing consumption in bulk instead of taxing property.According to his ideas, consumption was the sole thing properly taxable in times of peace.Land-taxes should always be held in reserve in case of war; for then only could the State justly demand sacrifices from the soil, which was in danger; but in times of peace it was a serious political fault to burden it beyond a certain limit; otherwise it could never be depended on in great emergencies.Thus a loan should be put on the market when the country was tranquil, for at such times it could be placed at par, instead of at fifty per cent loss as in bad times; in war times resort should be had to a land-tax.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不幸的是，他认为一八二零年他刚开始致力于改革工作之时，这个让人佩服的公务机制所包含的真正原则几乎不为人所知。他计划对消费征收直接税，抑制整个体系中对间接税的征收。将税款的征收用一种单一的分类方法进行简化，下设数量众多的征税项目。这就消除了城市之间长期存在的关税壁垒困扰，并通过减少征税所需的巨额开支，从剩余的税种中征得最大化的收入。从财政角度讲，减轻税务负担并不是要减少税收，而是要更好地评估税收。税收负担减轻了，交易就更自由了，交易量也会增长。个人上缴的税款减少了，国家的收入却更多了。这项改革看似庞大，依靠的运行机制其实十分简单。拉布丹认为，个人财产税在体现全民消费水平方面最值得信赖。在法国，个人财产通常可以从租金、佣人数量、马匹马车以及奢侈品的数量上得以体现，这些花费全都符合国库的利益。相对而言，个人的房屋和屋内财产差异很小，但也不太可能会消失。他指出了个人财产税征收名目制定办法，这与现行名目相比应该会更为公正。在这之后，拉布丹又对会被纳入国库的间接税数额进行了估算，按百分比平分到每一个人头上。征税，是在似是而非的掩盖下，对人或物征收钱财的一种行动。政府要敲诈勒索钱财时，这些掩盖十分奏效。但如今赋税最重的阶级已经了解到国家征税的原因以及国家将税钱返还给人民所用的机制，这幌子就显得荒谬可笑了。事实上财政预算并不是一个保险柜，放进去什么就保存什么；预算是一个水壶，吸收的越多，倒出来的也越多，国家也就越兴旺。所以，假设有六百万家境宽裕的纳税人（拉布丹证实过这个数字，这其中包括了富人），让他们交点买酒税岂不更好，这不会比征收门窗购买税更无理。这一举措将带来一亿的进项，而且政府不对酒这一物品本身上税，人民也不会觉得不胜其扰。事实上，在这种税收制度下，个人所缴的实际税款减少了，而国家收入却增多了。之前国家对物价的干预一直没完没了，令人民十分恼火，现在国家松松手，消费者就能享受到物价大幅下降带来的好处。拉布丹的计划里保留了葡萄园种植税，以保护这一产业免遭生产过剩之苦。然后，按照居住地的人口数量对零售商征收营业执照税，这样生活不太宽裕的人们消费了，政府也能对其征税。</td>
		<td class="en">Unfortunately, Xavier considered the true principles of this admirable machine of civil service very little understood at the period when he began his labor of reform in 1820.His scheme levied a toll on the consumption by means of direct taxation and suppressed the whole machinery of indirect taxation.The levying of the taxes was simplified by a single classification of a great number of articles.This did away with the more harassing customs at the gates of the cities, and obtained the largest revenues from the remainder, by lessening the enormous expense of collecting them.To lighten the burden of taxation is not, in matters of finance, to diminish the taxes, but to assess them better; if lightened, you increase the volume of business by giving it freer play; the individual pays less and the State receives more.This reform, which may seem immense, rests on very simple machinery.Rabourdin regarded the tax on personal property as the most trustworthy representative of general consumption.Individual fortunes are usually revealed in France by rentals, by the number of servants, horses, carriages, and luxuries, the costs of which are all to the interest of the public treasury.Houses and what they contain vary comparatively but little, and are not liable to disappear.After pointing out the means of making a tax-list on personal property which should be more impartial than the existing list, Rabourdin assessed the sums to be brought into the treasury by indirect taxation as so much per cent on each individual share.A tax is a levy of money on things or persons under disguises that are more or less specious.These disguises, excellent when the object is to extort money, become ridiculous in the present day, when the class on which the taxes weigh the heaviest knows why the State imposes them and by what machinery they are given back.In fact the budget is not a strong-box to hold what is put into it, but a watering-pot; the more it takes in and the more it pours out the better for the prosperity of the country.Therefore, supposing there are six millions of tax-payers in easy circumstances (Rabourdin proved their existence, including the rich) is it not better to make them pay a duty on the consumption of wine, which would not be more offensive than that on doors and windows and would return a hundred millions, rather than harass them by taxing the thing itself.By this system of taxation, each individual tax-payer pays less in reality, while the State receives more, and consumers profit by a vast reduction in the price of things which the State releases from its perpetual and harassing interference.Rabourdin’s scheme retained a tax on the cultivation of vineyards, so as to protect that industry from the too great abundance of its own products.Then, to reach the consumption of the poorer tax-payers, the licences of retail dealers were taxed according to the population of the neighborhoods in which they lived.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如此一来，国家就可以通过酒税、葡萄园种植税和营业执照税三种形式获得大笔进项。这笔进项不需投入成本，更不会惹来阻碍征税的人徒增麻烦。目前，这一大摞令人讨厌的税务对国家、对公务员都是沉重的负担。于是税收就加在了富人身上，穷人的担子也就不至过重。再举个例子吧。假设，预计每个人为买盐支付一两个法郎，政府就可以进账一千万到一千二百万。现代的“盐税局”就会消失，穷人们就可以缓口气，农业也会得到解脱。国家收的钱一样多，但没有纳税人会抱怨了。所有人，不论属于工业阶级还是资产阶级，当他们发觉农村地区的商业是如何扩展起来，农村居民的生活是如何得到改善时，都会立刻看到这种税收方法的好处。简而言之，国家会看到生活宽裕的纳税人数量一年年地增长。撤销耗费高昂的间接税务机构后（这种机构仿佛是国中之国），国家财政和纳税个人都会受益良多，更别提会节省多少征税开支了。</td>
		<td class="en">In this way, the State would receive without cost or vexatious hindrances an enormous revenue under three forms; namely, a duty on wine, on the cultivation of vineyards, and on licenses, where now an irritating array of taxes existed as a burden on itself and its officials.Taxation was thus imposed upon the rich without overburdening the poor.To give another example.Suppose a share assessed to each person of one or two francs for the consumption of salt and you obtain ten or a dozen millions; the modern “gabelle” disappears, the poor breathe freer, agriculture is relieved, the State receives as much, and no tax-payer complains.All persons, whether they belong to the industrial classes or to the capitalists, will see at once the benefits of a tax so assessed when they discover how commerce increases, and life is ameliorated in the country districts.In short, the State will see from year to year the number of her well-to-do tax-payers increasing.By doing away with the machinery of indirect taxation, which is very costly (a State, as it were, within a State), both the public finances and the individual tax-payer are greatly benefited, not to speak of the saving in costs of collecting.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其实，整件事情与其说是财政问题，还不如说是政府问题。国家现在拥有的一切，包括森林、矿产、公共事业，都不应归其所有。在拉布丹看来，国家成为土地所有者违背了行政宗旨。国家既不能将财产转化为利润，又不能对自身征税，那就失掉了两种形式的生产力。至于政府办的工厂，在工业圈里也是一种不合理的存在。国家工厂收购的产品比商业售价还高，生产速度却更慢，国家就没办法从工业里收上税来，反过来维护工厂的费用也会减少。不去促进工厂的发展，却让国家来生产，用这样的方法管理一个国家难道恰当吗？一个国家不去创造更多财富，让产业更加多样化，而去占有财产，这难道恰当吗？在拉布丹的体制里，国家不会索取现金担保，他只允许抵押担保，理由如下：国家要么持有这些抵押硬币，阻碍企业发展和资金运转；要么以高于其自身所付的利息投出去，这无异于卑鄙可耻的抢劫勾当。但如果不这样做，国家就会在这笔交易中赔钱，那可就太蠢了。此外，假如国家什么时候不得不处理掉一大笔抵押资金，那么发生性质恶劣的破产事件的风险就上升了。</td>
		<td class="en">The whole subject is indeed less a question of finance than a question of government.The State should possess nothing of its own, neither forests, nor mines, nor public works.That it should be the owner of domains was, in Rabourdin’s opinion, an administrative contradiction.The State cannot turn its possessions to profit and it deprives itself of taxes; it thus loses two forms of production.As to the manufactories of the government, they are just as unreasonable in the sphere of industry.The State obtains products at a higher cost than those of commerce, produces them more slowly, and loses its tax upon the industry, the maintenance of which it, in turn, reduces.Can it be thought a proper method of governing a country to manufacture instead of promoting manufactures? to possess property instead of creating more possessions and more diverse ones?In Rabourdin’s system the State exacted no money security; he allowed only mortgage securities; and for this reason: Either the State holds the security in specie, and that embarrasses business and the movement of money; or it invests it at a higher rate than the State itself pays, and that is a contemptible robbery; or else it loses on the transaction, and that is folly; moreover, if it is obliged at any time to dispose of a mass of these securities it gives rises in certain cases to terrible bankruptcy.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The territorial tax did not entirely disappear in Rabourdin’s plan,—he kept a minute portion of it as a point of departure in case of war; but the productions of the soil were freed, and industry, finding raw material at a low price, could compete with foreign nations without the deceptive help of customs.The rich carried on the administration of the provinces without compensation except that of receiving a peerage under certain conditions.Magistrates, learned bodies, officers of the lower grades found their services honorably rewarded; no man employed by the government failed to obtain great consideration through the value and extent of his labors and the excellence of his salary; every one was able to provide for his own future and France was delivered from the cancer of pensions.As a result Rabourdin’s scheme exhibited only seven hundred millions of expenditures and twelve hundred millions of receipts.A saving of five hundred millions annually had far more virtue than the accumulation of a sinking fund whose dangers were plainly to be seen.In that fund the State, according to Rabourdin, became a stockholder, just as it persisted in being a land-holder and a manufacturer.To bring about these reforms without too roughly jarring the existing state of things or incurring a Saint-Bartholomew of clerks, Rabourdin considered that an evolution of twenty years would be required.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Such were the thoughts maturing in Rabourdin’s mind ever since his promised place had been given to Monsieur de la Billardiere, a man of sheer incapacity.This plan, so vast apparently yet so simple in point of fact, which did away with so many large staffs and so many little offices all equally useless, required for its presentation to the public mind close calculations, precise statistics, and self-evident proof.Rabourdin had long studied the budget under its double-aspect of ways and means and of expenditure.Many a night he had lain awake unknown to his wife.But so far he had only dared to conceive the plan and fit it prospectively to the administrative skeleton; all of which counted for nothing,—he must gain the ear of a minister capable of appreciating his ideas.Rabourdin’s success depended on the tranquil condition of political affairs, which up to this time were still unsettled.He had not considered the government as permanently secure until three hundred deputies at least had the courage to form a compact majority systematically ministerial.An administration founded on that basis had come into power since Rabourdin had finished his elaborate plan.At this time the luxury of peace under the Bourbons had eclipsed the warlike luxury of the days when France shone like a vast encampment, prodigal and magnificent because it was victorious.After the Spanish campaign, the administration seemed to enter upon an era of tranquillity in which some good might be accomplished; and three months before the opening of our story a new reign had begun without any apparent opposition; for the liberalism of the Left had welcomed Charles X. with as much enthusiasm as the Right.Even clear-sighted and suspicious persons were misled.The moment seemed propitious for Rabourdin.What could better conduce to the stability of the government than to propose and carry through a reform whose beneficial results were to be so vast?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Thus it was that about this period in their lives she resolved to take the making of her husband’s fortune on herself; to thrust him at any cost into a higher sphere, and to hide from him the secret springs of her machinations.She carried into all her plans the independence of ideas which characterized her, and was proud to think that she could rise above other women by sharing none of their petty prejudices and by keeping herself untrammelled by the restraints which society imposes.In her anger she resolved to fight fools with their own weapons, and to make herself a fool if need be.She saw things coming to a crisis.The time was favorable.Monsieur de la Billardiere, attacked by a dangerous illness, was likely to die in a few days.If Rabourdin succeeded him, his talents (for Celestine did vouchsafe him an administrative gift) would be so thoroughly appreciated that the office of Master of petitions, formerly promised, would now be given to him; she fancied she saw him the king’s commissioner, presenting bills to the Chambers and defending them; then indeed she could help him; she would even be, if needful, his secretary; she would sit up all night to do the work!All this to drive in the Bois in a pretty carriage, to equal Madame Delphine de Nucingen, to raise her salon to the level of Madame Colleville’s, to be invited to the great ministerial solemnities, to win listeners and make them talk of her as “Madame Rabourdin DE something or other” (she had not yet determined on the estate), just as they did of Madame Firmiani, Madame d’Espard, Madame d’Aiglemont, Madame de Carigliano, and thus efface forever the odious name of Rabourdin.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">These secret schemes brought some changes into the household.Madame Rabourdin began to walk with a firm step in the path of debt.She set up a man-servant, and put him in livery of brown cloth with red pipins, she renewed parts of her furniture, hung new papers on the walls, adorned her salon with plants and flowers, always fresh, and crowded it with knick-knacks that were then in vogue; then she, who had always shown scruples as to her personal expenses, did not hesitate to put her dress in keeping with the rank to which she aspired, the profits of which were discounted in several of the shops where she equipped herself for war.To make her “Wednesdays” fashionable she gave a dinner on Fridays, the guests being expected to pay their return visit and take a cup of tea on the following Wednesday.She chose her guests cleverly among influential deputies or other persons of note who, sooner or later, might advance her interests.In short, she gathered an agreeable and befitting circle about her.People amused themselves at her house; they said so at least, which is quite enough to attract society in Paris.Rabourdin was so absorbed in completing his great and serious work that he took no notice of the sudden reappearance of luxury in the bosom of his family.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Des Lupeaulx was just forty years old.His youth had long been a vexation to him, for he felt that the making of his career depended on his becoming a deputy.How had he reached his present position? may be asked.By very simple means.He began by taking charge of certain delicate missions which can be given neither to a man who respects himself nor to a man who does not respect himself, but are confided to grave and enigmatic individuals who can be acknowledged or disavowed at will.His business was that of being always compromised; but his fortunes were pushed as much by defeat as by success.He well understood that under the Restoration, a period of continual compromises between men, between things, between accomplished facts and other facts looking on the horizon, it was all-important for the ruling powers to have a household drudge.Observe in a family some old charwoman who can make beds, sweep the floors, carry away the dirty linen, who knows where the silver is kept, how the creditors should be pacified, what persons should be let in and who must be kept out of the house, and such a creature, even if she has all the vices, and is dirty, decrepit, and toothless, or puts into the lottery and steals thirty sous a day for her stake, and you will find the masters like her from habit, talk and consult in her hearing upon even critical matters; she comes and goes, suggests resources, gets on the scent of secrets, brings the rouge or the shawl at the right moment, lets herself be scolded and pushed downstairs, and the next morning reappears smiling with an excellent bouillon.No matter how high a statesman may stand, he is certain to have some household drudge, before whom he is weak, undecided, disputations with fate, self-questioning, self-answering, and buckling for the fight.Such a familiar is like the soft wood of savages, which, when rubbed against the hard wood, strikes fire.Sometimes great geniuses illumine themselves in this way.Napoleon lived with Berthier, Richelieu with Pere Joseph; des Lupeaulx was the familiar of everybody.He continued friends with fallen ministers and made himself their intermediary with their successors, diffusing thus the perfume of the last flattery and the first compliment.He well understood how to arrange all the little matters which a statesman has no leisure to attend to.He saw necessities as they arose; he obeyed well; he could gloss a base act with a jest and get the whole value of it; and he chose for the services he thus rendered those that the recipients were not likely to forget.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Thus, when it was necessary to cross the ditch between the Empire and the Restoration, at a time when every one was looking about for planks, and the curs of the Empire were howling their devotion right and left, des Lupeaulx borrowed large sums from the usurers and crossed the frontier.Risking all to win all, he bought up Louis XVIII.’s most pressing debts, and was the first to settle nearly three million of them at twenty per cent—for he was lucky enough to be backed by Gobseck in 1814 and 1815.It is true that Messrs. Gobseck, Werdet, and Gigonnet swallowed the profits, but des Lupeaulx had agreed that they should have them; he was not playing for a stake; he challenged the bank, as it were, knowing very well that the king was not a man to forget this debt of honor.Des Lupeaulx was not mistaken; he was appointed Master of petitions, Knight of the order of Saint Louis, and officer of the Legion of honor.Once on the ladder of political success, his clever mind looked about for the means to maintain his foothold; for in the fortified city into which he had wormed himself, generals do not long keep useless mouths.So to his general trade of household drudge and go-between he added that of gratuitous consultation on the secret maladies of power.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">After discovering in the so-called superior men of the Restoration their utter inferiority in comparison with the events which had brought them to the front, he overcame their political mediocrity by putting into their mouths, at a crisis, the word of command for which men of real talent were listening.It must not be thought that this word was the outcome of his own mind.Were it so, des Lupeaulx would have been a man of genius, whereas he was only a man of talent.He went everywhere, collected opinions, sounded consciences, and caught all the tones they gave out.He gathered knowledge like a true and indefatigable political bee.This walking Bayle dictionary did not act, however, like that famous lexicon; he did not report all opinions without drawing his own conclusions; he had the talent of a fly which drops plumb upon the best bit of meat in the middle of a kitchen.In this way he came to be regarded as an indispensable helper to statesmen.A belief in his capacity had taken such deep root in all minds that the more ambitious public men felt it was necessary to compromise des Lupeaulx in some way to prevent his rising higher; they made up to him for his subordinate public position by their secret confidence.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Nevertheless, feeling that such men were dependent on him, this gleaner of ideas exacted certain dues.He received a salary on the staff of the National Guard, where he held a sinecure which was paid for by the city of Paris; he was government commissioner to a secret society; and filled a position of superintendence in the royal household.His two official posts which appeared on the budget were those of secretary-general to his ministry and Master of petitions.What he now wanted was to be made commander of the Legion of honor, gentleman of the bed-chamber, count, and deputy.To be elected deputy it was necessary to pay taxes to the amount of a thousand francs; and the miserable homestead of the des Lupeaulx was rated at only five hundred.Where could he get money to build a mansion and surround it with sufficient domain to throw dust in the eyes of a constituency?Though he dined out every day, and was lodged for the last nine years at the cost of the State, and driven about in the minister’s equipage, des Lupeaulx possessed absolutely nothing, at the time when our tale opens, but thirty thousand francs of debt—undisputed property.A marriage might float him and pump the waters of debt out of his bark; but a good marriage depended on his advancement, and his advancement required that he should be a deputy.Searching about him for the means of breaking through this vicious circle, he could think of nothing better than some immense service to render or some delicate intrigue to carry through for persons in power.Alas! conspiracies were out of date; the Bourbons were apparently on good terms with all parties; and, unfortunately, for the last few years the government had been so thoroughly held up to the light of day by the silly discussions of the Left, whose aim seemed to be to make government of any kind impossible in France, that no good strokes of business could be made.The last were tried in Spain, and what an outcry that excited!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In addition to all this, des Lupeaulx complicated matters by believing in the friendship of his minister, to whom he had the imprudence to express the wish to sit on the ministerial benches.The minister guessed at the real meaning of the desire, which simply was that des Lupeaulx wanted to strengthen a precarious position, so that he might throw off all dependence on his chief.The harrier turned against the huntsman; the minister gave him cuts with the whip and caresses, alternately, and set up rivals to him.But des Lupeaulx behaved like an adroit courtier with all competitors; he laid traps into which they fell, and then he did prompt justice upon them.The more he felt himself in danger the more anxious he became for an irremovable position; yet he was compelled to play low; one moment’s indiscretion, and he might lose everything.A pen-stroke might demolish his civilian epaulets, his place at court, his sinecure, his two offices and their advantages; in all, six salaries retained under fire of the law against pluralists.Sometimes he threatened his minister as a mistress threatens her lover; telling him he was about to marry a rich widow.At such times the minister petted and cajoled des Lupeaulx.After one of these reconciliations he received the formal promise of a place in the Academy of Belles-lettres on the first vacancy.“It would pay,” he said, “the keep of a horse.”His position, so far as it went, was a good one, and Clement Chardin des Lupeaulx flourished in it like a tree planted in good soil.He could satisfy his vices, his caprices, his virtues and his defects.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">At the time of which we write, the Chamber did not meddle shabbily with the budget, as it does in the deplorable days in which we now live; it did not contemptibly reduce ministerial emoluments, nor save, as they say in the kitchen, the candle-ends; on the contrary, it granted to each minister taking charge of a public department an indemnity, called an “outfit.”It costs, alas, as much to enter on the duties of a minister as to retire from them; indeed, the entrance involves expenses of all kinds which it is quite impossible to inventory.This indemnity amounted to the pretty little sum of twenty-five thousand francs.When the appointment of a new minister was gazetted in the “Moniteur,” and the greater or lesser officials, clustering round the stoves or before the fireplaces and shaking in their shoes, asked themselves: “What will he do? will he increase the number of clerks? will he dismiss two to make room for three?” the cashier tranquilly took out twenty-five clean bank-bills and pinned them together with a satisfied expression on his beadle face.The next day he mounted the private staircase and had himself ushered into the minister’s presence by the lackeys, who considered the money and the keeper of money, the contents and the container, the idea and the form, as one and the same power.The cashier caught the ministerial pair at the dawn of official delight, when the newly appointed statesman is benign and affable.To the minister’s inquiry as to what brings him there, he replies with the bank-notes,—informing his Excellency that he hastens to pay him the customary indemnity.Moreover, he explains the matter to the minister’s wife, who never fails to draw freely upon the fund, and sometimes takes all, for the “outfit” is looked upon as a household affair.The cashier then proceeds to turn a compliment, and to slip in a few politic phrases: “If his Excellency would deign to retain him; if, satisfied with his purely mechanical services, he would,” etc.As a man who brings twenty-five thousand francs is always a worthy official, the cashier is sure not to leave without his confirmation to the post from which he has seen a succession of ministers come and go during a period of, perhaps, twenty-five years.His next step is to place himself at the orders of Madame; he brings the monthly thirteen thousand francs whenever wanted; he advances or delays the payment as requested, and thus manages to obtain, as they said in the monasteries, a voice in the chapter.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The supernumerary is to the administration what a choir-boy is to a church, what the company’s child is to the regiment, what the figurante is to a theatre; something artless, naive, innocent, a being blinded by illusions.Without illusions what would become of any of us?They give strength to bear the res angusta domi of arts and the beginnings of all science by inspiring us with faith.Illusion is illimitable faith.Now the supernumerary has faith in the administration; he never thinks it cold, cruel, and hard, as it really is.There are two kinds of supernumeraries, or hangers-on,—one poor, the other rich.The poor one is rich in hope and wants a place, the rich one is poor in spirit and wants nothing.A wealthy family is not so foolish as to put its able men into the administration.It confides an unfledged scion to some head-clerk, or gives him in charge of a directory who initiates him into what Bilboquet, that profound philosopher, called the high comedy of government; he is spared all the horrors of drudgery and is finally appointed to some important office.The rich supernumerary never alarms the other clerks; they know he does not endanger their interests, for he seeks only the highest posts in the administration.About the period of which we write many families were saying to themselves: “What can we do with our sons?”The army no longer offered a chance for fortune.Special careers, such as civil and military engineering, the navy, mining, and the professorial chair were all fenced about by strict regulations or to be obtained only by competition; whereas in the civil service the revolving wheel which turned clerks into prefects, sub-prefects, assessors, and collectors, like the figures in a magic lantern, was subjected to no such rules and entailed no drudgery.Through this easy gap emerged into life the rich supernumeraries who drove their tilburys, dressed well, and wore moustachios, all of them as impudent as parvenus.Journalists were apt to persecute the tribe, who were cousins, nephews, brothers, or other relatives of some minister, some deputy, or an influential peer.The humbler clerks regarded them as a means of influence.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The poor supernumerary, on the other hand, who is the only real worker, is almost always the son of some former clerk’s widow, who lives on a meagre pension and sacrifices herself to support her son until he can get a place as copying-clerk, and then dies leaving him no nearer the head of his department than writer of deeds, order-clerks, or, possibly, under-head-clerk.Living always in some locality where rents are low, this humble supernumerary starts early from home.For him the Eastern question relates only to the morning skies.To go on foot and not get muddied, to save his clothes, and allow for the time he may lose in standing under shelter during a shower, are the preoccupations of his mind.The street pavements, the flaggings of the quays and the boulevards, when first laid down, were a boon to him.If, for some extraordinary reason, you happen to be in the streets of Paris at half-past seven or eight o’clock of a winter’s morning, and see through piercing cold or fog or rain a timid, pale young man loom up, cigarless, take notice of his pockets.You will be sure to see the outline of a roll which his mother has given him to stay his stomach between breakfast and dinner.The guilelessness of the supernumerary does not last long.A youth enlightened by gleams by Parisian life soon measures the frightful distance that separates him from the head-clerkship, a distance which no mathematician, neither Archimedes, nor Leibnitz, nor Laplace has ever reckoned, the distance that exists between 0 and the figure 1.He begins to perceive the impossibilities of his career; he hears talk of favoritism; he discovers the intrigues of officials: he sees the questionable means by which his superiors have pushed their way,—one has married a young woman who made a false step; another, the natural daughter of a minister; this one shouldered the responsibility of another’s fault; that one, full of talent, risks his health in doing, with the perseverance of a mole, prodigies of work which the man of influence feels incapable of doing for himself, though he takes the credit.Everything is known in a government office.The incapable man has a wife with a clear head, who has pushed him along and got him nominated for deputy; if he has not talent enough for an office, he cabals in the Chamber.The wife of another has a statesman at her feet.A third is the hidden informant of a powerful journalist.Often the disgusted and hopeless supernumerary sends in his resignation.About three fourths of his class leave the government employ without ever obtaining an appointment, and their number is winnowed down to either those young men who are foolish or obstinate enough to say to themselves, “I have been here three years, and I must end sooner or later by getting a place,” or to those who are conscious of a vocation for the work.Undoubtedly the position of supernumerary in a government office is precisely what the novitiate is in a religious order,—a trial.It is a rough trial.The State discovers how many of them can bear hunger, thirst, and penury without breaking down, how many can toil without revolting against it; it learns which temperaments can bear up under the horrible experience—or if you like, the disease—of government official life.From this point of view the apprenticeship of the supernumerary, instead of being an infamous device of the government to obtain labor gratis, becomes a useful institution.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Rabourdin had noted a vocation for his work in the lad, and as he himself took the whole service seriously, he felt a lively interest in him.He guessed the poverty of his mother’s home, kept together on a widow’s pension of seven hundred francs a year—for the education of the son, who was just out of college, had absorbed all her savings.He therefore treated the youth almost paternally; often endeavoured to get him some fee from the Council, or paid it from his own pocket.He overwhelmed Sebastien with work, trained him, and allowed him to do the work of du Bruel’s place, for which that vaudevillist, otherwise known as Cursy, paid him three hundred francs out of his salary.In the minds of Madame de la Roche and her son, Rabourdin was at once a great man, a tyrant, and an angel.On him all the poor fellow’s hopes of getting an appointment depended, and the lad’s devotion to his chief was boundless.He dined once a fortnight in the rue Duphot; but always at a family dinner, invited by Rabourdin himself; Madame asked him to evening parties only when she wanted partners.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">At that moment Rabourdin was scolding poor Sebastien, the only human being who was in the secret of his immense labors.The youth copied and recopied the famous “statement,” written on a hundred and fifty folio sheets, besides the corroborative documents, and the summing up (contained in one page), with the estimates bracketed, the captions in a running hand, and the sub-titles in a round one.Full of enthusiasm, in spite of his merely mechanical participation in the great idea, the lad of twenty would rewrite whole pages for a single blot, and made it his glory to touch up the writing, regarding it as the element of a noble undertaking.Sebastien had that afternoon committed the great imprudence of carrying into the general office, for the purpose of copying, a paper which contained the most dangerous facts to make known prematurely, namely, a memorandum relating to the officials in the central offices of all ministries, with facts concerning their fortunes, actual and prospective, together with the individual enterprises of each outside of his government employment.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一楼被隔层一分为二，埃内斯特·德拉布里埃的生活间和办公室都在那里。这是一个神秘的大人物，关于他必须得说上几句，因为他值得一提。在本届政府的整个任期当中，这个年轻人一直是大臣的私人秘书。他的房间有扇密门连通着大臣阁下的私人办公室。私人秘书之于大臣就像德吕卜克斯之于整个部门那样。拉布里埃和德吕卜克斯之间的差别正如副官和参谋长之间的差别。保护人离职，大臣的学徒也会撤营；保护人重新得志的时候，学徒也会沾光。如果大臣在失势的时候依旧受到皇室赏识，或者在议会还有希望，他就会带着自己的秘书一起退休。只有他自己回来了，秘书才会跟着回来。要不然，他就把秘书放养到名目众多的部门中的其中之一去——例如会计部。私人秘书就在这路边的避难所里等待风暴的过去。准确地讲，这个年轻人不是政府官员，却是政界的一个人物。有时他的政治思想只是局限在某一个人身上。除了安排给他的其他工作，我们还会想到这个私人秘书必须要拆阅的信件数量。很显然，在君主政体下，国家会付给他很高的薪酬。国家每年需花费一万甚至两万法郎雇人干这种苦力活。而且他去剧院可以享受包厢，会收到社交邀请，还能坐大臣专用的马车。这些温和的宪政贵宾犬非常绅士、亲切、驯服，有着漂亮的卷毛，既干净又整洁。它们是一群细心的看门狗，从某种程度上说是非常忠诚的！俄国皇帝要是一年出五万法郎弄到一只，也会深感欣慰的。不过私人秘书是代议政府温室的产物，只在那里出生、生长。在君主制下，你只会看到廷臣和仆从；而在宪政制下，就会有自由人对你奉承、拍你马屁、为你效力。在法国，大臣可比国王或女人们强多了，因为大臣拥有完全理解他们的知己。也许私人秘书像女人和白纸一样，的确值得同情。他们无足轻重，却得承担一切。他们必须收敛才华，而又必须为大臣所用。他们一崭露头角，就可能会毁了自己。所以，私人秘书是政府授予大臣的亲密朋友。不过，还是让我们回到处里吧。</td>
		<td class="en">On the first floor, divided in two by an entresol, were the living rooms and office of Monsieur Ernest de la Briere, an occult and powerful personage who must be described in a few words, for he well deserves the parenthesis.This young man held, during the whole time that this particular administration lasted, the position of private secretary to the minister.His apartment was connected by a secret door with the private office of his Excellency.A private secretary is to the minister himself what des Lupeaulx was to the ministry at large.The same difference existed between young La Briere and des Lupeaulx that there is between an aide-de-camp and a chief of staff.This ministerial apprentice decamps when his protector leaves office, returning sometimes when he returns.If the minister enjoys the royal favor when he falls, or still has parliamentary hopes, he takes his secretary with him into retirement only to bring him back on his return; otherwise he puts him to grass in some of the various administrative pastures,—for instance, in the Court of Exchequer, that wayside refuge where private secretaries wait for the storm to blow over.The young man is not precisely a government official; he is a political character, however; and sometimes his politics are limited to those of one man.When we think of the number of letters it is the private secretary’s fate to open and read, besides all his other avocations, it is very evident that under a monarchical government his services would be well paid for.A drudge of this kind costs ten or twenty thousand francs a year; and he enjoys, moreover, the opera-boxes, the social invitations, and the carriages of the minister.The Emperor of Russia would be thankful to be able to pay fifty thousand a year to one of these amiable constitutional poodles, so gentle, so nicely curled, so caressing, so docile, always spick and span,—careful watch-dogs besides, and faithful to a degree!But the private secretary is a product of the representative government hot-house; he is propagated and developed there, and there only.Under a monarchy you will find none but courtiers and vassals, whereas under a constitutional government you may be flattered, served, and adulated by free men.In France ministers are better off than kings or women; they have some one who thoroughly understands them.Perhaps, indeed, the private secretary is to be pitied as much as women and white paper.They are nonentities who are made to bear all things.They are allowed no talents except hidden ones, which must be employed in the service of their ministers.A public show of talent would ruin them.The private secretary is therefore an intimate friend in the gift of government—However, let us return to the bureaus.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Here follows the portrait of Monsieur Dutocq, order-clerk in the Rabourdin bureau: Thirty-eight years old, oblong face and bilious skin, grizzled hair always cut close, low forehead, heavy eyebrows meeting together, a crooked nose and pinched lips; tall, the right shoulder slightly higher than the left; brown coat, black waistcoat, silk cravat, yellowish trousers, black woollen stockings, and shoes with flapping bows; thus you behold him.Idle and incapable, he hated Rabourdin,—naturally enough, for Rabourdin had no vice to flatter, and no bad or weak side on which Dutocq could make himself useful.Far too noble to injure a clerk, the chief was also too clear-sighted to be deceived by any make-believe.Dutocq kept his place therefore solely through Rabourdin’s generosity, and was very certain that he could never be promoted if the latter succeeded La Billardiere.Though he knew himself incapable of important work, Dutocq was well aware that in a government office incapacity was no hindrance to advancement; La Billardiere’s own appointment over the head of so capable a man as Rabourdin had been a striking and fatal example of this.Wickedness combined with self-interest works with a power equivalent to that of intellect; evilly disposed and wholly self-interested, Dutocq had endeavoured to strengthen his position by becoming a spy in all the offices.After 1816 he assumed a marked religious tone, foreseeing the favor which the fools of those days would bestow on those they indiscriminately called Jesuits.Belonging to that fraternity in spirit, though not admitted to its rites, Dutocq went from bureau to bureau, sounded consciences by recounting immoral jests, and then reported and paraphrased results to des Lupeaulx; the latter thus learned all the trivial events of the ministry, and often surprised the minister by his consummate knowledge of what was going on.He tolerated Dutocq under the idea that circumstances might some day make him useful, were it only to get him or some distinguished friend of his out of a scrape by a disgraceful marriage.The two understood each other well.Dutocq had succeeded Monsieur Poiret the elder, who had retired in 1814, and now lived in the pension Vanquer in the Latin quarter.Dutocq himself lived in a pension in the rue de Beaune, and spent his evenings in the Palais-Royal, sometimes going to the theatre, thanks to du Bruel, who gave him an author’s ticket about once a week.And now, a word on du Bruel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然塞巴斯蒂安接替了迪布吕埃尔的工作，拿到了一小笔补偿金。这个我们之前已经提过，不过迪布吕埃尔还是习惯去之前的办公室给自己升为副处长打打广告，还能一并领取薪酬。他真正的工作是在一份重要的部门期刊上发表戏剧评论，也替大臣们写东西——表明他们不言自明、清晰明确、无懈可击的观点立场。迪布吕埃尔可不缺那些调和众人口味的圆滑手腕。他替拉布丹夫人安排了首场演出的剧场包厢，还用马车接送她——这份关切显然取悦了她。拉布丹从不逼迫下属做事。他准许迪布吕埃尔排练，准许他自己安排上下班时间，还准许他在部里写杂剧。德绍利厄公爵大臣了解到，迪布吕埃尔正在写一部小说，准备献给他。早晨，迪布吕埃尔按照剧作家漫不经心的轻松风格将自己打扮了一番——他的裤子垂到了脚底下，背心明显是几种布料七拼八凑缝起来的；他还穿了一件橄榄绿长外套，戴着一条黑色的领带。到了晚上，他则会换上高雅的衣服扮作绅士。他给女演员弗洛丽娜写剧本，以很合理的缘由住在她家里。迪布吕埃尔，笔名居尔西，正在写一本给法国人观看的五幕剧。作者偶尔会送给塞巴斯蒂安一些池座票。忠心的塞巴斯蒂安在戏演到迪勃吕埃尔不确定的地方时，会以他毕生的忠诚与热情鼓掌叫好。事实上，这个年轻人把迪布吕埃尔看成伟大的作家。迪布吕埃尔会像所有杂剧作家那样，在一部三人合写的剧首演后的第二天告诉塞巴斯蒂安，“观众更喜欢看两个人写的剧”。</td>
		<td class="en">Though Sebastien did his work at the office for the small compensation we have mentioned, du Bruel was in the habit of coming there to advertise the fact that he was the under-head-clerk and to draw his salary.His real work was that of dramatic critic to a leading ministerial journal, in which he also wrote articles inspired by the ministers,—a very well understood, clearly defined, and quite unassailable position.Du Bruel was not lacking in those diplomatic little tricks which go so far to conciliate general good-will.He sent Madame Rabourdin an opera-box for a first representation, took her there in a carriage and brought her back,—an attention which evidently pleased her.Rabourdin, who was never exacting with his subordinates allowed du Bruel to go off to rehearsals, come to the office at his own hours, and work at his vaudevilles when there.Monsieur le Duc de Chaulieu, the minister, knew that du Bruel was writing a novel which was to be dedicated to himself.Dressed with the careless ease of a theatre man, du Bruel wore, in the morning, trousers strapped under his feet, shoes with gaiters, a waistcoat evidently vamped over, an olive surtout, and a black cravat.At night he played the gentleman in elegant clothes.He lived, for good reasons, in the same house as Florine, an actress for whom he wrote plays.Du Bruel, or to give him his pen name, Cursy, was working just now at a piece in five acts for the Francais.Sebastien was devoted to the author,—who occasionally gave him tickets to the pit,—and applauded his pieces at the parts which du Bruel told him were of doubtful interest, with all the faith and enthusiasm of his years.In fact, the youth looked upon the playwright as a great author, and it was to Sebastien that du Bruel said, the day after a first representation of a vaudeville produced, like all vaudevilles, by three collaborators, “The audience preferred the scenes written by two.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >迪布吕埃尔不独自写剧，当然是有原因的。他算得上第三分之一个作者。鲜为人知的是，一个剧作家由三个人组合而成。首先，要有人创作杂剧的主题，筹划结构或情景；其次，要有一位勤劳之士将作品塑造成型；再次，要有人润色，替音乐配上歌曲、安排合唱、协调乐章，还得让乐章逐个就位，最后写点吹捧的赞辞，进行广告宣传。迪布吕埃尔就是那个专司写作的勤劳之士。他在办公室阅读最新书籍，汲取书里的智慧，然后放到剧中的对话里。他为人心细，深受合作人喜欢。创作人相信自己的想法一定会被他理解，并被很好地演绎出来，于是便可高枕无忧了。办公室的公务员都很喜欢他，他们会结队去看他的首演，为剧本叫好。好同事这个称呼确实配得上他。他很乐意掏钱，不用人怂恿便会请他们吃冰激凌、喝宾治酒，借给人家五十法郎也不会要求人家还。他在奥尔奈有幢乡村住宅。除了政府发的四千五百法郎薪水以外，还从皇室经费里领一千二百法郎退休金。另外议会投票通过了促进艺术发展所需的三十万法郎基金，他从中获得了八百法郎。在这多项收入之外，还要加上三个剧场上演所获得的四分之一、三分之一和一半的款项，这相当于九千法郎。这样 你就会明白，这个人肯定是一位体形圆胖、心情舒畅、受人尊敬的资产者了。从心理上讲，他和蒂莉娅是恋人。他感觉到蒂莉娅发自内心地喜欢他，超过了她对精明的情场老手德雷托雷公爵的喜欢。</td>
		<td class="en">There were good reasons why du Bruel did not write alone.He was the third of an author.A dramatic writer, as few people know, is made up of three individuals; first, the man with brains who invents the subject and maps out the structure, or scenario, of the vaudeville; second, the plodder, who works the piece into shape; and third, the toucher-up, who sets the songs to music, arranges the chorus and concerted pieces and fits them into their right place, and finally writes the puffs and advertisements.Du Bruel was a plodder; at the office he read the newest books, extracted their wit, and laid it by for use in his dialogues.He was liked by his collaborators on account of his carefulness; the man with brains, sure of being understood, could cross his arms and feel that his ideas would be well rendered.The clerks in the office liked their companion well enough to attend a first performance of his plays in a body and applaud them, for he really deserved the title of a good fellow.His hand went readily to his pocket; ices and punch were bestowed without prodding, and he loaned fifty francs without asking them back.He owned a country-house at Aulnay, laid by his money, and had, besides the four thousand five hundred francs of his salary under government, twelve hundred francs pension from the civil list, and eight hundred from the three hundred thousand francs fund voted by the Chambers for encouragement of the Arts.Add to these diverse emoluments nine thousand francs earned by his quarters, thirds, and halves of plays in three different theatres, and you will readily understand that such a man must be physically round, fat, and comfortable, with the face of a worthy capitalist.As to morals, he was the lover and the beloved of Tullia and felt himself preferred in heart to the brilliant Duc de Rhetore, the lover in chief.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The first to arrive after Sebastien was a clerk of deeds in Rabourdin’s office named Phellion, a respectable family-man.To the influence of his chief he owed a half-scholarship for each of his two sons in the College Henri IV.; while his daughter was being educated gratis at a boarding school where his wife gave music lessons and he himself a course of history and one of geography in the evenings.He was about forty-five years of age, sergeant-major of his company in the National Guard, very compassionate in feeling and words, but wholly unable to give away a penny.Proud of his post, however, and satisfied with his lot, he applied himself faithfully to serve the government, believed he was useful to his country, and boasted of his indifference to politics, knowing none but those of the men in power.Monsieur Rabourdin pleased him highly whenever he asked him to stay half an hour longer to finish a piece of work.On such occasions he would say, when he reached home, “Public affairs detained me; when a man belongs to the government he is no longer master of himself.”He compiled books of questions and answers on various studies for the use of young ladies in boarding-schools.These little “solid treatises,” as he called them, were sold at the University library under the name of “Historical and Geographic Catechisms.”Feeling himself in duty bound to offer a copy of each volume, bound in red morocco, to Monsieur Rabourdin, he always came in full dress to present them,—breeches and silk stockings, and shoes with gold buckles.Monsieur Phellion received his friends on Thursday evenings, on which occasions the company played bouillote, at five sous a game, and were regaled with cakes and beer.He had never yet dared to invite Monsieur Rabourdin to honor him with his presence, though he would have regarded such an event as the most distinguished of his life.He said if he could leave one of his sons following in the steps of Monsieur Rabourdin he should die the happiest father in the world.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">After trying to get a few reasonable ideas into this foolish head, Rabourdin had finally given up the attempt as hopeless.Adolphe (his family name was Adolphe) had lately economized on dinners and lived entirely on bread and water, to buy a pair of spurs and a riding-whip.Jokes at the expense of this starving Amadis were made only in the spirit of mischievous fun which creates vaudevilles, for he was really a kind-hearted fellow and a good comrade, who harmed no one but himself.A standing joke in the two bureaus was the question whether he wore corsets, and bets depended on it.Vimeux was originally appointed to Baudoyer’s bureau, but he manoeuvred to get himself transferred to Rabourdin’s, on account of Baudoyer’s extreme severity in relation to what were called “the English,”—a name given by the government clerks to their creditors.“English day” means the day on which the government offices are thrown open to the public.Certain then of finding their delinquent debtors, the creditors swarm in and torment them, asking when they intend to pay, and threatening to attach their salaries.The implacable Baudoyer compelled the clerks to remain at their desks and endure this torture.“It was their place not to make debts,” he said; and he considered his severity as a duty which he owed to the public weal.Rabourdin, on the contrary, protected the clerks against their creditors, and turned the latter away, saying that the government bureaus were open for public business, not private.Much ridicule pursued Vimeux in both bureaus when the clank of his spurs resounded in the corridors and on the staircases.The wag of the ministry, Bixiou, sent round a paper, headed by a caricature of his victim on a pasteboard horse, asking for subscriptions to buy him a live charger.Monsieur Baudoyer was down for a bale of hay taken from his own forage allowance, and each of the clerks wrote his little epigram; Vimeux himself, good-natured fellow that he was, subscribed under the name of “Miss Fairfax.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The devil always puts a martyr near a Bixiou.Baudoyer’s bureau held the martyr, a poor copying-clerk twenty-two years of age, with a salary of fifteen hundred francs, named Auguste-Jean-Francois Minard.Minard had married for love the daughter of a porter, an artificial-flower maker employed by Mademoiselle Godard.Zelie Lorrain, a pupil, in the first place, of the Conservatoire, then by turns a danseuse, a singer, and an actress, had thought of doing as so many of the working-women do; but the fear of consequences kept her from vice.She was floating undecidedly along, when Minard appeared upon the scene with a definite proposal of marriage.Zelie earned five hundred francs a year, Minard had fifteen hundred.Believing that they could live on two thousand, they married without settlements, and started with the utmost economy.They went to live, like dove-turtles, near the barriere de Courcelles, in a little apartment at three hundred francs a year, with white cotton curtains to the windows, a Scotch paper costing fifteen sous a roll on the walls, brick floors well polished, walnut furniture in the parlor, and a tiny kitchen that was very clean.Zelie nursed her children herself when they came, cooked, made her flowers, and kept the house.There was something very touching in this happy and laborious mediocrity.Feeling that Minard truly loved her, Zelie loved him.Love begets love,—it is the abyssus abyssum of the Bible.The poor man left his bed in the morning before his wife was up, that he might fetch provisions.He carried the flowers she had finished, on his way to the bureau, and bought her materials on his way back; then, while waiting for dinner, he stamped out her leaves, trimmed the twigs, or rubbed her colors.Small, slim, and wiry, with crisp red hair, eyes of a light yellow, a skin of dazzling fairness, though blotched with red, the man had a sturdy courage that made no show.He knew the science of writing quite as well as Vimeux.At the office he kept in the background, doing his allotted task with the collected air of a man who thinks and suffers.His white eyelashes and lack of eyebrows induced the relentless Bixiou to name him “the white rabbit.”Minard—the Rabourdin of a lower sphere—was filled with the desire of placing his Zelie in better circumstances, and his mind searched the ocean of the wants of luxury in hopes of finding an idea, of making some discovery or some improvement which would bring him a rapid fortune.His apparent dulness was really caused by the continual tension of his mind; he went over the history of Cephalic Oils and the Paste of Sultans, lucifer matches and portable gas, jointed sockets for hydrostatic lamps,—in short, all the infinitely little inventions of material civilization which pay so well.He bore Bixiou’s jests as a busy man bears the buzzing of an insect; he was not even annoyed by them.In spite of his cleverness, Bixiou never perceived the profound contempt which Minard felt for him.Minard never dreamed of quarrelling, however,—regarding it as a loss of time.After a while his composure tired out his tormentor.He always breakfasted with his wife, and ate nothing at the office.Once a month he took Zelie to the theatre, with tickets bestowed by du Bruel or Bixiou; for Bixiou was capable of anything, even of doing a kindness.Monsieur and Madame Minard paid their visits in person on New-Year’s day.Those who saw them often asked how it was that a woman could keep her husband in good clothes, wear a Leghorn bonnet with flowers, embroidered muslin dresses, silk mantles, prunella boots, handsome fichus, a Chinese parasol, and drive home in a hackney-coach, and yet be virtuous; while Madame Colleville and other “ladies” of her kind could scarcely make ends meet, though they had double Madame Minard’s means.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Such were the principal figures of La Billardiere’s division of the ministry, where also were other clerks of less account, who resembled more or less those that are represented here.It is difficult even for an observer to decide from the aspect of these strange personalities whether the goose-quill tribe were becoming idiots from the effects of their employment or whether they entered the service because they were natural born fools.Possibly the making of them lies at the door of Nature and of the government both.Nature, to a civil-service clerk is, in fact, the sphere of the office; his horizon is bounded on all sides by green boxes; to him, atmospheric changes are the air of the corridors, the masculine exhalations contained in rooms without ventilators, the odor of paper, pens, and ink; the soil he treads is a tiled pavement or a wooden floor, strewn with a curious litter and moistened by the attendant’s watering-pot; his sky is the ceiling toward which he yawns; his element is dust.Several distinguished doctors have remonstrated against the influence of this second nature, both savage and civilized, on the moral being vegetating in those dreadful pens called bureaus, where the sun seldom penetrates, where thoughts are tied down to occupations like that of horses who turn a crank and who, poor beasts, yawn distressingly and die quickly.Rabourdin was, therefore, fully justified in seeking to reform their present condition, by lessening their numbers and giving to each a larger salary and far heavier work.Men are neither wearied nor bored when doing great things.Under the present system government loses fully four hours out of the nine which the clerks owe to the service,—hours wasted, as we shall see, in conversations, in gossip, in disputes, and, above all, in underhand intriguing.The reader must have haunted the bureaus of the ministerial departments before he can realize how much their petty and belittling life resembles that of seminaries.Wherever men live collectively this likeness is obvious; in regiments, in law-courts, you will find the elements of the school on a smaller or larger scale.The government clerks, forced to be together for nine hours of the day, looked upon their office as a sort of class-room where they had tasks to perform, where the head of the bureau was no other than a schoolmaster, and where the gratuities bestowed took the place of prizes given out to proteges,—a place, moreover, where they teased and hated each other, and yet felt a certain comradeship, colder than that of a regiment, which itself is less hearty than that of seminaries.As a man advances in life he grows more selfish; egoism develops, and relaxes all the secondary bonds of affection.A government office is, in short, a microcosm of society, with its oddities and hatreds, its envy and its cupidity, its determination to push on, no matter who goes under, its frivolous gossip which gives so many wounds, and its perpetual spying.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">This morning was to Rabourdin like the solemn hour in which great commanders decide upon a battle and weigh all chances.Knowing the spirit of official life better than any one, he well knew that it would never pardon, any more than a school or the galleys or the army pardon, what looked like espionage or tale-bearing.A man capable of informing against his comrades is disgraced, dishonored, despised; the ministers in such a case would disavow their own agents.Nothing was left to an official so placed but to send in his resignation and leave Paris; his honor is permanently stained; explanations are of no avail; no one will either ask for them or listen to them.A minister may well do the same thing and be thought a great man, able to choose the right instruments; but a mere subordinate will be judged as a spy, no matter what may be his motives.While justly measuring the folly of such judgment, Rabourdin knew that it was all-powerful; and he knew, too, that he was crushed.More surprised than overwhelmed, he now sought for the best course to follow under the circumstances; and with such thoughts in his mind he was necessarily aloof from the excitement caused in the division by the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere; in fact he did not hear of it until young La Briere, who was able to appreciate his sterling value, came to tell him.About ten o’clock, in the bureau Baudoyer, Bixiou was relating the last moments of the life of the director to Minard, Desroys, Monsieur Godard, whom he had called from his private office, and Dutocq, who had rushed in with private motives of his own.Colleville and Chazelle were absent.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Like all other ministers under the Restoration, this particular minister was a man without youth.The charter granted by Louis XVIII. had the defect of tying the hands of the kings by compelling them to deliver the destinies of the nation into the control of the middle-aged men of the Chamber and the septuagenarians of the peerage; it robbed them of the right to lay hands on a man of statesmanlike talent wherever they could find him, no matter how young he was or how poverty-stricken his condition might be.Napoleon alone was able to employ young men as he chose, without being restrained by any consideration.After the overthrow of that mighty will, vigor deserted power.Now the period when effeminacy succeeds to vigor presents a contrast that is far more dangerous in France than in other countries.As a general thing, ministers who were old before they entered office have proved second or third rate, while those who were taken young have been an honor to European monarchies and to the republics whose affairs they have directed.The world still rings with the struggle between Pitt and Napoleon, two men who conducted the politics of their respective countries at an age when Henri de Navarre, Richelieu, Mazarin, Colbert, Louvois, the Prince of Orange, the Guises, Machiavelli, in short, all the best known of our great men, coming from the ranks or born to a throne, began to rule the State.The Convention—that model of energy—was made up in a great measure of young heads; no sovereign can ever forget that it was able to put fourteen armies into the field against Europe.Its policy, fatal in the eyes of those who cling to what is called absolute power, was nevertheless dictated by strictly monarchical principles, and it behaved itself like any of the great kings.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">After ten or a dozen years of parliamentary struggle, having studied the science of politics until he was worn down by it, this particular minister had come to be enthroned by his party, who considered him in the light of their business man.Happily for him he was now nearer sixty than fifty years of age; had he retained even a vestige of juvenile vigor he would quickly have quenched it.But, accustomed to back and fill, retreat and return to the charge, he was able to endure being struck at, turn and turn about, by his own party, by the opposition, by the court, by the clergy, because to all such attacks he opposed the inert force of a substance which was equally soft and consistent; thus he reaped the benefits of what was really his misfortune.Harassed by a thousand questions of government, his mind, like that of an old lawyer who has tried every species of case, no longer possessed the spring which solitary minds are able to retain, nor that power of prompt decision which distinguishes men who are early accustomed to action, and young soldiers.How could it be otherwise?He had practised sophistries and quibbled instead of judging; he had criticised effects and done nothing for causes; his head was full of plans such as a political party lays upon the shoulders of a leader,—matters of private interest brought to an orator supposed to have a future, a jumble of schemes and impractical requests.Far from coming fresh to his work, he was wearied out with marching and counter-marching, and when he finally reached the much desired height of his present position, he found himself in a thicket of thorny bushes with a thousand conflicting wills to conciliate.If the statesmen of the Restoration had been allowed to follow out their own ideas, their capacity would doubtless have been criticised; but though their wills were often forced, their age saved them from attempting the resistance which youth opposes to intrigues, both high and low,—intrigues which vanquished Richelieu, and to which, in a lower sphere, Rabourdin was to succumb.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">After the rough and tumble of their first struggles in political life these men, less old than aged, have to endure the additional wear and tear of a ministry.Thus it is that their eyes begin to weaken just as they need to have the clear-sightedness of eagles; their mind is weary when its youth and fire need to be redoubled.The minister in whom Rabourdin sought to confide was in the habit of listening to men of undoubted superiority as they explained ingenious theories of government, applicable or inapplicable to the affairs of France.Such men, by whom the difficulties of national policy were never apprehended, were in the habit of attacking this minister personally whenever a parliamentary battle or a contest with the secret follies of the court took place,—on the eve of a struggle with the popular mind, or on the morrow of a diplomatic discussion which divided the Council into three separate parties.Caught in such a predicament, a statesman naturally keeps a yawn ready for the first sentence designed to show him how the public service could be better managed.At such periods not a dinner took place among bold schemers or financial and political lobbyists where the opinions of the Bourse and the Bank, the secrets of diplomacy, and the policy necessitated by the state of affairs in Europe were not canvassed and discussed.The minister has his own private councillors in des Lupeaulx and his secretary, who collected and pondered all opinions and discussions for the purpose of analyzing and controlling the various interests proclaimed and supported by so many clever men.In fact, his misfortune was that of most other ministers who have passed the prime of life; he trimmed and shuffled under all his difficulties,—with journalism, which at this period it was thought advisable to repress in an underhand way rather than fight openly; with financial as well as labor questions; with the clergy as well as with that other question of the public lands; with liberalism as with the Chamber.After manoeuvering his way to power in the course of seven years, the minister believed that he could manage all questions of administration in the same way.It is so natural to think we can maintain a position by the same methods which served us to reach it that no one ventured to blame a system invented by mediocrity to please minds of its own calibre.The Restoration, like the Polish revolution, proved to nations as to princes the true value of a Man, and what will happen if that necessary man is wanting.The last and the greatest weakness of the public men of the Restoration was their honesty, in a struggle in which their adversaries employed the resources of political dishonesty, lies, and calumnies, and let loose upon them, by all subversive means, the clamor of the unintelligent masses, able only to understand revolt.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Chapter VII  Scenes From Domestic Life</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴黎的家庭在方方面面都有维持奢侈的欲望，也几乎都被这种欲望吃空了。很少有人有这种头脑，能让外部环境和内部收入保持一致。可是这种罪过也许是法国爱国主义的真实表象，这种爱国主义试图通过衣着来保持这个国家至高无上的地位。法国通过服装统治了整个欧洲，人人都必须感受到保持法国商业王权地位的重要意义。时尚之于法国，正如海军之于英国，这也是这种地位造成的。亨利四世时期的奥比涅曾说过——对于那些“爱国者”，爱国热情能使整个国家为外表容貌牺牲一切。这也给巴黎女性造成了庞大的秘密劳动，占据了她们整个早晨的时间。如果她们和拉布丹夫人的希望一致，想用一万二千法郎过上很多年收入三万法郎的家庭都不敢奢望的生活，她们就得这么干。因此，每个星期五——她的聚会日——拉布丹夫人会帮着女佣打扫房间，因为厨子很早就去了集市，而男佣则在清洁银器、叠餐布和擦亮玻璃杯。如果早晨约莫十一点钟的时候，看门人一时疏忽让一个没头脑的客人闯进了拉布丹夫人的宅子，那这个客人会发现拉布丹夫人置身于一团乱糟糟的景象当中，颠覆了她之前的美好形象。她裹着件睡袍，头发还没打理，脚踩一双旧拖鞋，忙着点灯、摆花，或者匆匆忙忙弄一顿毫无诗意的早餐。客人即使之前对巴黎生活的神秘一面毫不知情，他在以后的人生中也一定会知道绝不该在错误的时刻踏入演员休息室。女人若被人看见了早晨的秘密，以后就会不停地指责那人，说他能犯下最黑暗的罪孽；或与人谈论他的愚蠢轻率之举，好破坏他的名声。真实的巴黎女人，对一切能给她带来利益的好奇心都是很宽容的，而在有损自己声望的事情上则是不依不饶的。此种擅闯私宅的行为不仅可以被称作（就像人们在给警局的报告里说的那样）攻击隐私，还可称作一场盗窃、抢劫，被偷盗的是最受人珍视的东西——信誉。一个女人倒是很愿意被人意外看见自己衣衫不整、头发披肩的样子。倘若头发全是真发，那她会有所收获，可她决不允许被人瞧见她在“收拾”自己的屋子，否则她会颜面尽失——颜面看上去是多么珍贵的东西啊！</td>
		<td class="en">Parisian households are literally eaten up with the desire to be in keeping with the luxury that surrounds them on all sides, and few there are who have the wisdom to let their external situation conform to their internal revenue.But this vice may perhaps denote a truly French patriotism, which seeks to maintain the supremacy of the nation in the matter of dress.France reigns through clothes over the whole of Europe; and every one must feel the importance of retaining a commercial sceptre that makes fashion in France what the navy is to England.This patriotic ardor which leads a nation to sacrifice everything to appearances—to the “paroistre,” as d’Aubigne said in the days of Henri IV.—is the cause of those vast secret labors which employ the whole of a Parisian woman’s morning, when she wishes, as Madame Rabourdin wished, to keep up on twelve thousand francs a year the style that many a family with thirty thousand does not indulge in.Consequently, every Friday,—the day of her dinner parties,—Madame Rabourdin helped the chambermaid to do the rooms; for the cook went early to market, and the man-servant was cleaning the silver, folding the napkins, and polishing the glasses.The ill-advised individual who might happen, through an oversight of the porter, to enter Madame Rabourdin’s establishment about eleven o’clock in the morning would have found her in the midst of a disorder the reverse of picturesque, wrapped in a dressing-gown, her hair ill-dressed, and her feet in old slippers, attending to the lamps, arranging the flowers, or cooking in haste an extremely unpoetic breakfast.The visitor to whom the mysteries of Parisian life were unknown would certainly have learned for the rest of his life not to set foot in these greenrooms at the wrong moment; a woman caught in her matin mysteries would ever after point him out as a man capable of the blackest crimes; or she would talk of his stupidity and indiscretion in a manner to ruin him.The true Parisian woman, indulgent to all curiosity that she can put to profit, is implacable to that which makes her lose her prestige.Such a domiciliary invasion may be called, not only (as they say in police reports) an attack on privacy, but a burglary, a robbery of all that is most precious, namely, CREDIT.A woman is quite willing to let herself be surprised half-dressed, with her hair about her shoulders.If her hair is all her own she scores one; but she will never allow herself to be seen “doing” her own rooms, or she loses her pariostre,—that precious seeming-to-be!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Madame Rabourdin was in full tide of preparation for her Friday dinner, standing in the midst of provisions the cook had just fished from the vast ocean of the markets, when Monsieur des Lupeaulx made his way stealthily in.The general-secretary was certainly the last man Madame Rabourdin expected to see, and so, when she heard his boots creaking in the ante-chamber, she exclaimed, impatiently, “The hair-dresser already!”—an exclamation as little agreeable to des Lupeaulx as the sight of des Lupeaulx was agreeable to her.She immediately escaped into her bedroom, where chaos reigned; a jumble of furniture to be put out of sight, with other heterogeneous articles of more or rather less elegance,—a domestic carnival, in short.The bold des Lupeaulx followed the handsome figure, so piquant did she seem to him in her dishabille.There is something indescribably alluring to the eye in a portion of flesh seen through an hiatus in the undergarment, more attractive far than when it rises gracefully above the circular curve of the velvet bodice, to the vanishing line of the prettiest swan’s-neck that ever lover kissed before a ball.When the eye dwells on a woman in full dress making exhibition of her magnificent white shoulders, do we not fancy that we see the elegant dessert of a grand dinner?But the glance that glides through the disarray of muslins rumpled in sleep enjoys, as it were, a feast of stolen fruit glowing between the leaves on a garden wall.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The next day Celestine began her preparations for entrance into the inner circle of the ministry.It was her day of triumph, her own!Never courtesan took such pains with herself as this honest woman bestowed upon her person.No dressmaker was ever so tormented as hers.Madame Rabourdin forgot nothing.She went herself to the stable where she hired carriages, and chose a coupe that was neither old, nor bourgeois, nor showy.Her footman, like the footmen of great houses, had the dress and appearance of a master.About ten on the evening of the eventful Tuesday, she left home in a charming full mourning attire.Her hair was dressed with jet grapes of exquisite workmanship,—an ornament costing three thousand francs, made by Fossin for an Englishwoman who had left Paris before it was finished.The leaves were of stamped iron-work, as light as the vine-leaves themselves, and the artist had not forgotten the graceful tendrils, which twined in the wearer’s curls just as, in nature, they catch upon the branches.The bracelets, necklace, and earrings were all what is called Berlin iron-work; but these delicate arabesques were made in Vienna, and seemed to have been fashioned by the fairies who, the stories tell us, are condemned by a jealous Carabosse to collect the eyes of ants, or weave a fabric so diaphanous that a nutshell can contain it.Madame Rabourdin’s graceful figure, made more slender still by the black draperies, was shown to advantage by a carefully cut dress, the two sides of which met at the shoulders in a single strap without sleeves.At every motion she seemed, like a butterfly, to be about to leave her covering; but the gown held firmly on by some contrivance of the wonderful dressmaker.The robe was of mousseline de laine—a material which the manufacturers had not yet sent to the Paris markets; a delightful stuff which some months later was to have a wild success, a success which went further and lasted longer than most French fashions.The actual economy of mousseline de laine, which needs no washing, has since injured the sale of cotton fabrics enough to revolutionize the Rouen manufactories.Celestine’s little feet, covered with fine silk stockings and turk-satin shoes (for silk-satin is inadmissible in deep mourning) were of elegant proportions.Thus dressed, she was very handsome.Her complexion, beautified by a bran-bath, was softly radiant.Her eyes, suffused with the light of hope, and sparkling with intelligence, justified her claims to the superiority which des Lupeaulx, proud and happy on this occasion, asserted for her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她举止得当地走进了房间（女人们可以理解这句话的意思），优雅地向大臣夫人躬身行礼。这一动作漂亮地将敬意和自尊融合到了一起。她端庄却又自持，所以没有冒犯别人，因为每个漂亮的女人都有权看上去像女皇一般。和大臣相处时，她则表现出一副无礼却又妩媚的神情。女人和男人在一起时，哪怕是和地位高贵的公爵在一起时也可以适度如此。她就坐后开始勘察这个战场，这也的的确确是个战场。她发现自己已经置身于只有少数人参加的贵宾聚会之中了。在这里，女人们相互打量、相互欣赏。人们说的每一句话都会回响在所有人耳边，每一种眼神都能戳伤人，每一轮对话都像一场被见证的决斗。在这里，普通的东西看上去会更一般；每一项优点或出众之处都会被人们默然接纳，仿佛在场的所有人自然而然就有这种水平。拉布丹一个人走进了隔壁客厅，那里有一些人正在玩牌。他站着一动不动，好像在做展览一样，以此证明了他并非没有社交才能。</td>
		<td class="en">She entered the room well (women will understand the meaning of that expression), bowed gracefully to the minister’s wife, with a happy mixture of deference and of self-respect, and gave no offence by a certain reliance on her own dignity; for every beautiful woman has the right to seem a queen.With the minister himself she took the pretty air of sauciness which women may properly allow themselves with men, even when they are grand dukes.She reconnoitred the field, as it were, while taking her seat, and saw that she was in the midst of one of those select parties of few persons, where the women eye and appraise each other, and every word said echoes in all ears; where every glance is a stab, and conversation a duel with witnesses; where all that is commonplace seems commoner still, and where every form of merit or distinction is silently accepted as though it were the natural level of all present.Rabourdin betook himself to the adjoining salon in which a few persons were playing cards; and there he planted himself on exhibition, as it were, which proved that he was not without social intelligence.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">At this moment the wily Madame Rabourdin was courting the minister’s wife.Carefully coached the evening before by des Lupeaulx, who knew all the countess’s weak spots, she was flattering her without seeming to do so.Every now and then she kept silence; for des Lupeaulx, in love as he was, knew her defects, and said to her the night before, “Be careful not to talk too much,”—words which were really an immense proof of attachment.Bertrand Barrere left behind him this sublime axiom: “Never interrupt a woman when dancing to give her advice,” to which we may add (to make this chapter of the female code complete), “Never blame a woman for scattering her pearls.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们的谈话没有涉及什么具体的方面。拉布丹夫人时而补充几句。她就像一只精心驯过的猫一样，小心翼翼地收起爪子，把天鹅绒一般柔顺的脚掌放在了女主人的蕾丝上。大臣的内心则几乎没有多少情感可言。在复辟王朝下，没有第二个政治家能像他这样，从来不向女人献殷勤。甚至是连《镜报》、《潘多拉》和《费加罗》这样的反对派报纸，也挑不出一根悸动的脉搏来指责他。拉布丹夫人了解这一点，不过她也知道鬼魂总会回到古老的城堡里。于是，她已在脑中记下要让大臣嫉妒德吕卜克斯在表面上享受的幸福。事实上，后者的喉咙里正在咕隆着他女神的名字。他为了成功推出他认定的情人，正在参加一个八只耳朵一起听的谈话。他正在努力说服德埃斯巴侯爵夫人、纽沁根夫人及伯爵夫人，让她们相信接受拉布丹夫人加入她们的同盟是明智之举，德康夫人对他表示支持。这一个小时过去后，大臣的虚荣心极大地骚动起来，拉布丹夫人的机智取悦了他。她也赢得了他太太的心，大臣夫人快活地邀请这个女妖来参加她的全部宴会，只要她乐意，什么时候来都行。</td>
		<td class="en">The conversation became general.From time to time Madame Rabourdin joined in, just as a well-trained cat puts a velvet paw on her mistress’s laces with the claws carefully drawn in.The minister, in matters of the heart, had few emotions.There was not another statesman under the Restoration who had so completely done with gallantry as he; even the opposition papers, the “Miroir,” “Pandora,” and “Figaro,” could not find a single throbbing artery with which to reproach him.Madame Rabourdin knew this, but she knew also that ghosts return to old castles, and she had taken it into her head to make the minister jealous of the happiness which des Lupeaulx was appearing to enjoy.The latter’s throat literally gurgled with the name of his divinity.To launch his supposed mistress successfully, he was endeavoring to persuade the Marquise d’Espard, Madame de Nucingen, and the countess, in an eight-ear conversation, that they had better admit Madame Rabourdin to their coalition; and Madame de Camps was supporting him.At the end of the hour the minister’s vanity was greatly tickled; Madame Rabourdin’s cleverness pleased him, and she had won his wife, who, delighted with the siren, invited her to come to all her receptions whenever she pleased.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Des Lupeaulx.“After all, though statistics are the childish foible of modern statesmen, who think that figures are estimates, we must cipher to estimate.Figures are, moreover, the convincing argument of societies based on self-interest and money, and that is the sort of society the Charter has given us,—in my opinion, at any rate.Nothing convinces the ‘intelligent masses’ as much as a row of figures.All things in the long run, say the statesmen of the Left, resolve themselves into figures.Well then, let us figure” (the minister here goes off into a corner with a deputy, to whom he talks in a low voice).“There are forty thousand government clerks in France.The average of their salaries is fifteen hundred francs.Multiply forty thousand by fifteen hundred and you have sixty millions.Now, in the first place, a publicist would call the attention of Russia and China, also that of Austria, the American republics, and indeed that of the whole world, to the fact that for this price France possesses the most inquisitorial, fussy, ferreting, scribbling, paper-blotting, fault-finding old housekeeper of a civil service on God’s earth.Not a copper farthing of the nation’s money is spent or hoarded that is not ordered by a note, proved by vouchers, produced and re-produced on balance-sheets, and receipted for when paid; orders and receipts are registered on the rolls, and checked and verified by an army of men in spectacles.If there is the slightest mistake in the form of these precious documents, the clerk is terrified, for he lives on such minutiae.Some nations would be satisfied to get as far as this; but Napoleon went further.That great organizer appointed supreme magistrates of a court which is absolutely unique in the world.These officials pass their days in verifying money-orders, documents, roles, registers, lists, permits, custom-house receipts, payments, taxes received, taxes spent, etc.; all of which the clerks write or copy.These stern judges push the gift of exactitude, the genius of inquisition, the sharp-sightedness of lynxes, the perspicacity of account-books to the point of going over all the additions in search of subtractions.These sublime martyrs to figures have been known to return to an army commissary, after a delay of two years, some account in which there was an error of two farthings.This is how and why it is that the French system of administration, the purest and best on the globe has rendered robbery, as his Excellency has just told you, next to impossible, and as for peculation, it is a myth.France at this present time possesses a revenue of twelve hundred millions, and she spends it.That sum enters her treasury, and that sum goes out of it.She handles, therefore, two thousand four hundred millions, and all she pays for the labor of those who do the work is sixty millions,—two and a half per cent; and for that she obtains the certainty that there is no leakage.Our political and administrative kitchen costs us sixty millions, but the gendarmerie, the courts of law, the galleys and the police cost just as much, and give no return.Moreover, we employ a body of men who could do no other work.Waste and disorder, if such there be, can only be legislative; the Chambers lead to them and render them legal.Leakage follows in the form of public works which are neither urgent nor necessary; troops re-uniformed and gold-laced over and over again; vessels sent on useless cruises; preparations for war without ever making it; paying the debts of a State, and not requiring reimbursement or insisting on security.”</td></tr>
