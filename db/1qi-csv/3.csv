"第一章 一双手","Chapter 1 Hands"
"在俄亥俄州温斯堡镇旁的山谷边缘附近有一座小木屋。一个矮胖的老头儿正焦急地在半旧的走廊上来回踱步。小木屋前是一片开阔的田野，种的是苜蓿，却只开出了浓密的黄色芥末草。穿过田野，他看到一辆货车正在公路上行驶，车上坐满了刚从地里采完浆果回来的人。采浆果的那些年轻的小伙子和姑娘们大笑着、高声喊叫着。一个穿着蓝色衬衣的小伙子跳下货车，并试图把他身后的一个姑娘拽下来，那女孩尖叫着大声抗议。小伙子的脚踩在地上，扬起一片尘土，漂浮在落日的余晖中。田野那头传来了一个尖细的少女似的声音。“噢，温·彼得波姆，你梳梳头发吧，都快掉进眼睛里了！”声音所指的那个老头儿，头上光秃秃的，一双小手紧张地摸了摸白净的脑门，就好像在整理一大团凌乱的头发似的。","Upon the half decayed veranda of a small frame house that stood near the edge of a ravine near the town of Winesburg, Ohio, a fat little old man walked nervously up and down.Across a long field that had been seeded for clover but that had produced only a dense crop of yellow mustard weeds, he could see the public highway along which went a wagon filled with berry pickers returning from the fields.The berry pickers, youths and maidens, laughed and shouted boisterously.A boy clad in a blue shirt leaped from the wagon and attempted to drag after him one of the maidens, who screamed and protested shrilly.The feet of the boy in the road kicked up a cloud of dust that floated across the face of the departing sun.Over the long field came a thin girlish voice.“Oh, you Wing Biddlebaum, comb your hair, it’s falling into your eyes,” commanded the voice to the man, who was bald and whose nervous little hands fiddled about the bare white fore-head as though arranging a mass of tangled locks."
"这就是温·彼得波姆，一个总是惊惶不安、疑虑重重的老头儿。他在这个镇上住了二十年，却从来不认为自己是镇上生活的一份子。温斯堡镇里只有一个人和他有交情。那个人叫乔治•威拉德，是新威拉德旅社老板汤姆•威拉德的儿子。乔治和温之间建立了一种类似友谊的感情。乔治·威拉德在《温斯堡鹰报》当记者，有时他会在夜晚沿着公路步行到温·彼得波姆的家里。现在，老头儿就在山谷里来回踱步，双手紧张地四处动着，一心希望乔治能来和他共度这个夜晚。载着采浆果的少男少女的货车过去后，彼得波姆就从那片高高的芥末草地中间穿过田野，爬上铁路的围栏，沿着通向镇上的公路急切地眺望着。他在那里站了一会儿，不停地搓着手，来来回回地向公路张望着。接着，恐惧袭向他，他又跑回房子，重新在自家的门廊上踱步。","Wing Biddlebaum, forever frightened and beset by a ghostly band of doubts, did not think of himself as in any way a part of the life of the town where he had lived for twenty years.Among all the people of Winesburg but one had come close to him.With George Willard, son of Tom Willard, the proprietor of the New Willard House, he had formed something like a friendship.George Willard was the reporter on the Winesburg Eagle and sometimes in the evenings he walked out along the highway to Wing Biddlebaum’s house.Now as the old man walked up and down on the veranda, his hands moving nervously about, he was hoping that George Willard would come and spend the evening with him.After the wagon containing the berry pickers had passed, he went across the field through the tall mustard weeds and climbing a rail fence peered anxiously along the road to the town.For a moment he stood thus, rubbing his hands together and looking up and down the road, and then, fear overcoming him, ran back to walk again upon the porch on his own house."
"二十年来，温·彼得波姆一直是小镇上的一个谜。但是，在乔治•威拉德面前，他却没那么怯懦了，而他那淹没于疑虑之海里的若隐若现的个性也得以展现出来。当那位年轻的记者站在他身边时，彼得波姆敢在大白天走上大街，也敢在自己家歪斜的门廊里大步徜徉，兴奋地讲话了。以往低沉而颤抖的声音也变得尖锐而响亮。驼着的背也挺得笔直。就像一尾鱼从渔夫的手中一扭身重又潜入小溪，沉默的彼得波姆一旦开始谈话，那股劲头像是要把漫长沉寂岁月里积攒在他脑袋里的思想全部化作语言一般。","In the presence of George Willard, Wing Biddlebaum, who for twenty years had been the town mystery, lost something of his timidity, and his shadowy personality, submerged in a sea of doubts, came forth to look at the world.With the young reporter at his side, he ventured in the light of day into Main Street or strode up and down on the rickety front porch of his own house, talking excitedly.The voice that had been low and trembling became shrill and loud.The bent figure straightened.With a kind of wriggle, like a fish returned to the brook by the fisherman, Biddlebaum the silent began to talk, striving to put into words the ideas that had been accumulated by his mind during long years of silence."
"温·彼得波姆很善于用手势语言。他十指纤长，富于表现力，尽管非常活跃，却总是被竭力隐藏在口袋里或是背后。可是，现在这双手变成了他传情达意的生力军。","Wing Biddlebaum talked much with his hands.The slender expressive fingers, forever active, forever striving to conceal themselves in his pockets or behind his back, came forth and became the piston rods of his machinery of expression."
"温·彼得波姆的故事就是这双手的故事。这双手无休止的动作就好像是囚鸟在扑扇着双翼，温·彼得波姆也因此而得名（“温”在英文中和“翼”同音）。——这是镇上的一位无名诗人想出来的。可是，这双手却吓坏了它们的主人。他想要将它们藏起来，同时，他又惊奇地注视着其他人的手——那些手的主人和他并肩在田地里劳作，或者在乡村大路上赶着瞌睡的牲畜经过——他们的手安静而毫无表现力。","The story of Wing Biddlebaum is a story of hands.Their restless activity, like unto the beating of the wings of an imprisoned bird, had given him his name.Some obscure poet of the town had thought of it.The hands alarmed their owner.He wanted to keep them hidden away and looked with amazement at the quiet inexpressive hands of other men who worked beside him in the fields, or passed, driving sleepy teams on country roads."
"彼得波姆对乔治说话的时候，紧握着拳头，敲打着桌子或者是他房子的墙。这种行为让他更舒服。当他们在田野里散步，彼得波姆想要谈话的时候，他会设法找到一截树桩或者是一块栅栏顶板，然后用手不停地、重重地敲打着，这样，他就能重新从容自在地交谈了。","When he talked to George Willard, Wing Biddlebaum closed his fists and beat with them upon a table or on the walls of his house.The action made him more comfortable.If the desire to talk came to him when the two were walking in the fields, he sought out a stump or the top board of a fence and with his hands pounding busily talked with renewed ease."
"温·彼得波姆这双手的故事真值得大写特写。如果感性地写，那将会探及无名小卒的诸多奇异美好的品质。可这是诗人的工作。在温斯堡，这双手之所以引人注目仅仅是因为它们的动作而已。凭着这双手，温·彼得波姆曾在一天内摘过多达一百四十夸脱的草莓。这双手成了他的显著特征，使他出了名。它们同样使得这个原本怪异而不可捉摸的人变得更加离奇。温斯堡对温·彼得波姆的双手引以为傲，就好像为班克·怀特的新石头房子感到自豪，或者是因为威斯利·摩耶的的栗色雄马托尼·蒂普在克利夫兰秋季赛马中创下二分十五秒的记录而感到骄傲一样。","The story of Wing Biddlebaum’s hands is worth a book in itself.Sympathetically set forth it would tap many strange, beautiful qualities in obscure men.It is a job for a poet.In Winesburg the hands had attracted attention merely because of their activity.With them Wing Biddlebaum had picked as high as a hundred and forty quarts of strawberries in a day.They became his distinguishing feature, the source of his fame.Also they made more grotesque an already grotesque and elusive individuality.Winesburg was proud of the hands of Wing Biddlebaum in the same spirit in which it was proud of Banker White’s new stone house and Wesley Moyer’s bay stallion, Tony Tip, that had won the two-fifteen trot at the fall races in Cleveland."
"至于乔治·威拉德，他也曾经很多次地想要问问有关这双手的事。有时，他被一种几乎无法抗拒的好奇心所控制。他感到其中必定有什么原因使得这双手行为奇特却总是深藏不露。但是，他对这双手的主人的尊敬与日俱增，这使得他没能把这萦绕心头的问题脱口说出。","As for George Willard, he had many times wanted to ask about the hands.At times an almost overwhelming curiosity had taken hold of him.He felt that there must be a reason for their strange activity and their inclination to keep hidden away and only a growing respect for Wing Biddlebaum kept him from blurting out the questions that were often in his mind."
"有一次，他几乎话到嘴边了。那正是个夏日的午后，他们两人在田野里散步，停下来，坐在草堤边。整个下午，彼得波姆说个不停，情绪高昂。他在篱笆边上停下来，对着乔治·威拉德大声叫嚷着，像只巨型啄木鸟似的，一下一下敲打着顶上的木板。他谴责他太易受旁人左右：“你在毁灭自我，”他大声喊道，“你容易孤独，又喜好做梦，可你又害怕这些梦。你希望和镇上其他的人一样。你听见他们谈话，还试图去模仿。”","Once he had been on the point of asking.The two were walking in the fields on a summer afternoon and had stopped to sit upon a grassy bank.All afternoon Wing Biddlebaum had talked as one inspired.By a fence he had stopped and beating like a giant woodpecker upon the top board had shouted at George Willard, condemning his tendency to be too much influenced by the people about him, “You are destroying yourself,” he cried.“You have the inclination to be alone and to dream and you are afraid of dreams.You want to be like others in town here.You hear them talk and you try to imitate them.”"
"坐在草堤边上的时候，温·彼得波姆又尽力阐明观点。他声音变得柔和，充满了怀旧情绪。他心满意足地叹了口气，像个迷失在梦境里的人一样开始了漫无边际的长谈。","On the grassy bank Wing Biddlebaum had tried again to drive his point home.His voice became soft and reminiscent, and with a sigh of contentment he launched into a long rambling talk, speaking as one lost in a dream."
"他为乔治·维拉德描绘了这个梦。在梦境中，人们重又生活在一种田园牧歌式的黄金时代。越过一片苍翠开阔的乡村，一群手足匀称的年轻小伙子走了过来，有的步行，有的骑马。他们走过去，聚集在一位老人的周围。这位老人坐在小花园的一棵树下，正对着他们侃侃而谈。","Out of the dream Wing Biddlebaum made a picture for George Willard.In the picture men lived again in a kind of pastoral golden age.Across a green open country came clean-limbed young men, some afoot, some mounted upon horses.In crowds the young men came to gather about the feet of an old man who sat beneath a tree in a tiny garden and who talked to them."
"彼得波姆整个人变得亢奋起来。就这一次，他忘记了自己的那双手。慢慢地，这双手滑了出来，停在了乔治·威拉德的肩膀上。彼得波姆说话的声音听起来有些不同，透着勇敢。“你必须尽力忘掉所有你学过的东西，”他说道，“你必须开始做梦。从此刻起，你万不可再听信旁人的高谈阔论。”","Wing Biddlebaum became wholly inspired.For once he forgot the hands.Slowly they stole forth and lay upon George Willard’s shoulders.Something new and bold came into the voice that talked.“You must try to forget all you have learned,” said the old man.“You must begin to dream.From this time on you must shut your ears to the roaring of the voices.”"
"他停顿下来，热切而长久地注视着乔治。他的眼睛里闪闪发光。接下来，他抬起手轻抚着年轻人。而一瞥惊惧之色随即划过了他的脸庞。","Pausing in his speech, Wing Biddlebaum looked long and earnestly at George Willard.His eyes glowed.Again he raised the hands to caress the boy and then a look of horror swept over his face."
"彼得波姆浑身一震，跳了起来，然后将手深深地插进了自己的裤袋里。泪水随即涌入了他的眼眶。“我得回家了。我不能再和你多谈了。”他神色慌张地说。","With a convulsive movement of his body, Wing Biddlebaum sprang to his feet and thrust his hands deep into his trousers pockets.Tears came to his eyes.“I must be getting along home.I can talk no more with you,” he said nervously."
"老头儿头也不回地急急忙忙冲下山坡，穿过一片草地，留下乔治困惑又惶恐地坐在绿草如茵的山坡上。年轻人吓得哆嗦了一下，随后站了起来，沿着通向镇上的公路走去。“我不想再问他有关那双手的事了。”乔治想着，记起他在老人眼中看到的恐惧，不禁动容。“肯定有什么隐情，可我也不想弄明白。他对我和其他人的惧怕一定和他的那双手有关。”","Without looking back, the old man had hurried down the hillside and across a meadow, leaving George Willard perplexed and frightened upon the grassy slope.With a shiver of dread the boy arose and went along the road toward town.“I’ll not ask him about his hands,” he thought, touched by the memory of the terror he had seen in the man’s eyes.“There’s something wrong, but I don’t want to know what it is.His hands have something to do with his fear of me and of everyone.”"
"乔治·威拉德是对的。我们不妨简单地说说这双手的故事吧。也许我们的故事会引起某些诗人的注意。那些诗人愿意谈及感化的隐匿奇迹，对他们而言，这双手也不过是两面感化成功的旌旗罢了。","And George Willard was right.Let us look briefly into the story of the hands.Perhaps our talking of them will arouse the poet who will tell the hidden wonder story of the influence for which the hands were but fluttering pennants of promise."
"温·彼得波姆年轻时曾经在宾夕法尼亚的一个小镇上当过学校老师。那时他并不叫这个名字，而以音调欠佳的阿道夫·迈尔斯为名。作为教师的阿道夫·迈尔斯深受学校男孩子们的喜爱。","In his youth Wing Biddlebaum had been a school teacher in a town in Pennsylvania.He was not then known as Wing Biddlebaum, but went by the less euphonic name of Adolph Myers.As Adolph Myers he was much loved by the boys of his school."
"阿道夫·迈尔斯生来就是给年轻人当老师的。有些人世上少有，世人难解，性格过分温柔，以至于被当成一种可爱的缺点。他便是其中之一。这类人对于被管教的男孩子们的感情类似于性情温和的女子对于男子的爱情。","Adolph Myers was meant by nature to be a teacher of youth.He was one of those rare, little-understood men who rule by a power so gentle that it passes as a lovable weakness.In their feeling for the boys under their charge such men are not unlike the finer sort of women in their love of men."
"可这还不过是粗略的表述。这里需要诗人来解释。阿道夫·迈尔斯曾经同他学校的男孩子们在傍晚散步，或者坐在校舍的台阶上谈天说地直到黄昏，全然迷失在一种梦境中。　　他的手四处游走，抚摩男孩子们的肩膀，把玩他们蓬蓬乱发的脑袋。当他说话的时候，声音变得轻柔又富于音律。声音也在爱抚着。在某种意义上，这声音和这双手，轻抚肩膀以及抚摸头发，都是这个老师在以某种方式努力将一个梦灌入那些年轻的头脑中。通过手指的爱抚，他也表达了自己的内心。有些人创造生活的力量是发散而不集中的，他亦是其中之一。在他双手的爱抚下，孩子们内心的疑虑被驱散了，于是也开始做梦。","And yet that is but crudely stated.It needs the poet there.With the boys of his school, Adolph Myers had walked in the evening or had sat talking until dusk upon the schoolhouse steps lost in a kind of dream.Here and there went his hands, caressing the shoulders of the boys, playing about the tousled heads.As he talked his voice became soft and musical.There was a caress in that also.In a way the voice and the hands, the stroking of the shoulders and the touching of the hair were a part of the schoolmaster’s effort to carry a dream into the young minds.By the caress that was in his fingers he expressed himself.He was one of those men in whom the force that creates life is diffused, not centralized.Under the caress of his hands doubt and disbelief went out of the minds of the boys and they began also to dream."
"可这便是悲剧的开始。学校里一个懵懂的男孩子迷恋上了这位年轻的老师。他夜里躺在床上时幻想些不可名状的东西，清晨又将梦境当作事实讲了出来。　　从他那没有遮拦的嘴里说出了奇怪而可怕的控诉。整个宾夕法尼亚小镇为之不寒而栗。那些曾经隐藏在人们心里的对阿道夫·迈尔斯朦朦胧胧的怀疑，如今一下子激变成了让人坚信不移的事实。　　","And then the tragedy.A half-witted boy of the school became enamored of the young master.In his bed at night he imagined unspeakable things and in the morning went forth to tell his dreams as facts.Strange, hideous accusations fell from his loose-hung lips.Through the Pennsylvania town went a shiver.Hidden, shadowy doubts that had been in men’s minds concerning Adolph Myers were galvanized into beliefs."
"悲剧的势头急转直下。颤栗着的少年们从床上被拽起来问话。“他用胳膊搂过我。”一个孩子说。“他总是用手指抚摸我的头发。”另一个说。","The tragedy did not linger.Trembling lads were jerked out of bed and questioned.“He put his arms about me,” said one.“His fingers were always playing in my hair,” said another."
"一个下午，镇上的酒吧店主亨利·布莱德福德来到了学校的大门口。他将阿道夫·迈尔斯叫到学校后院，开始用拳头揍他。他坚硬的拳头落在了老师惊恐的脸上，可他的怒火却愈发不可遏止。惶恐不安的孩子们惊声尖叫，四处乱跑，像被惊扰的小虫子。“你竟敢把你的脏手伸到我孩子身上，你这个畜生，我得好好教训教训你。”酒吧店主咆哮着，打得不解气，就开始蛮院子地又踢又踹。","One afternoon a man of the town, Henry Bradford, who kept a saloon, came to the schoolhouse door.Calling Adolph Myers into the school yard he began to beat him with his fists.As his hard knuckles beat down into the frightened face of the school-master, his wrath became more and more terrible.Screaming with dismay, the children ran here and there like disturbed insects.“I’ll teach you to put your hands on my boy, you beast,” roared the saloon keeper, who, tired of beating the master, had begun to kick him about the yard."
"夜里，阿道夫·迈尔斯被从宾西尼亚的小镇赶了出去。一群男人，手里拿着灯笼，聚集到他独居的房子门前，命令他穿好衣服出来。天正下着雨，其中一个人手里还拿着一根绳子。他们本打算将他吊死，但是，这个老师看起来瘦小、苍白、可怜兮兮的，他们动了恻隐之心，于是，就让他逃走了。当他逃进黑暗中的时候，他们又懊悔自己心软，便在后面追赶他，一边咒骂着，一边用木棍和大块的软泥砸向他。老师尖声叫着，越跑越快，终于消失在了夜色里。阿道夫·迈尔斯在温斯堡住了二十年，孑然一身。不过四十来岁的人看上去倒有六十五岁。彼得波姆这个名字也是他在慌忙中经过俄亥俄东部的一个小镇时，在货站的一个货物箱上看到而得来的。他有个姑妈住在温斯堡，是个养鸡的老太太，长了一口黑牙，他一直和她住在一起，直到她去世。在经历了宾夕法尼亚的事情之后，他病了一年。身体康复后，他白天便在田里干活，四处走动时也畏畏缩缩地，总是尽力把手藏起来。尽管他不明白那究竟是怎么一回事，可他感到这双手是罪魁祸首。因为那些男孩的父亲们一次次地提到过这双手。“管好你的脏手。”那个酒吧店主就曾在校园的院子里暴跳如雷地这样咆哮过。","Adolph Myers was driven from the Pennsylvania town in the night.With lanterns in their hands a dozen men came to the door of the house where he lived alone and commanded that he dress and come forth.It was raining and one of the men had a rope in his hands.They had intended to hang the school-master, but something in his figure, so small, white, and pitiful, touched their hearts and they let him escape.As he ran away into the darkness they repented of their weakness and ran after him, swearing and throwing sticks and great balls of soft mud at the figure that screamed and ran faster and faster into the darkness.For twenty years Adolph Myers had lived alone in Winesburg.He was but forty but looked sixty-five.The name of Biddlebaum he got from a box of goods seen at a freight station as he hurried through an eastern Ohio town.He had an aunt in Winesburg, a black-toothed old woman who raised chickens, and with her he lived until she died.He had been ill for a year after the experience in Pennsylvania, and after his recovery worked as a day laborer in the fields, going timidly about and striving to conceal his hands.Although he did not understand what had happened he felt that the hands must be to blame.Again and again the fathers of the boys had talked of the hands.“Keep your hands to yourself,” the saloon keeper had roared, dancing, with fury in the schoolhouse yard."
"在山谷边，小木屋的回廊上，温·彼得波姆又开始来来回回地踱步。他一直徘徊到夕阳西下，直到田野那头的公路也消失在灰色的阴影里。他进了屋，切了几片面包，涂上蜂蜜。当晚间快车载着一天收获的浆果隆隆驶去，夏夜重新恢复寂静时，他又走到前门廊上。在黑夜中，他看不见那双手，手也一动不动。他仍然热切地盼望乔治能够出现。通过这位年轻人，他向人类表达了自己的亲近之情。但是，这种盼望最终也变成了他孤独的一部分，使得他总在等待。他点亮一盏灯，洗了洗那顿简单的晚餐弄脏的几个盘子，在通向门廊的纱门边支起一张折叠床，准备脱衣服睡觉。一些零星的白面包屑掉在桌旁洗涮干净的地板上；他把灯放在一张矮凳上，开始捡面包屑。然后，把它们一个接一个地放进嘴里，速度惊人。在桌子下浓密的阴影里，他跪着的身影看上去像是一个忙于教堂事务的牧师。他那些紧张而充满表现力的手指，在光影里闪现，人们很可能将它们误认为是信徒的手，在快速地、十个十个地数着念珠。","Upon the veranda of his house by the ravine, Wing Biddlebaum continued to walk up and down until the sun had disappeared and the road beyond the field was lost in the grey shadows.Going into his house he cut slices of bread and spread honey upon them.When the rumble of the evening train that took away the express cars loaded with the day’s harvest of berries had passed and restored the silence of the summer night, he went again to walk upon the veranda.In the darkness he could not see the hands and they became quiet.Although he still hungered for the presence of the boy, who was the medium through which he expressed his love of man, the hunger became again a part of his loneliness and his waiting.Lighting a lamp, Wing Biddlebaum washed the few dishes soiled by his simple meal and, setting up a folding cot by the screen door that led to the porch, prepared to undress for the night.A few stray white bread crumbs lay on the cleanly washed floor by the table; putting the lamp upon a low stool he began to pick up the crumbs, carrying them to his mouth one  by one with unbelievable rapidity.In the dense blotch of light beneath the table, the kneeling figure looked like a priest engaged in some service of his church.The nervous expressive fingers, flashing in and out of the light, might well have been mistaken for the fingers of the devotee going swiftly through decade after decade of his rosary."
"第二章 纸球","Chapter 2 Paper Pills"
"他是一个大鼻子、大手的白胡子老头。很久以前，早在我们认识他以前，他曾是一个医生，赶着匹疲倦的白马穿过温斯堡的街道，从这个房子到下个房子。后来，他娶了个有钱的姑娘。他的岳父在死后给女儿留下了一大片肥沃的农场。这个姑娘文静、高挑，肤色偏黑。在很多人看来，她十分漂亮。温斯堡的人都很好奇，为什么她最后嫁给了这个医生。婚后不到一年，她就死了。","He was an old man with a white beard and huge nose and hands.Long before the time during which we will know him, he was a doctor and drove a jaded white horse from house to house through the streets of Winesburg.Later he married a girl who had money.She had been left a large fertile farm when her father died.The girl was quiet, tall, and dark, and to many people she seemed very beautiful.Everyone in Winesburg wondered why she married the doctor.Within a year after the marriage she died."
"这个医生的手指关节特别粗大。当他双手紧握的时候，看上去就像两个未经涂漆的木制大球，还是用钢针串在一起的、胡桃般大的那种。他用科波烟斗抽烟。在妻子死后，他成天坐在空荡荡的办公室里，挨着一扇结满了蜘蛛网的窗户。他从不打开这扇窗户。他也曾在八月的一个热天试着开窗，却发现窗子已经卡死了。此后，他也完全忘记了这件事。","The knuckles of the doctor’s hands were extraordinarily large.When the hands were closed they looked like clusters of unpainted wooden balls as large as walnuts fastened together by steel rods.He smoked a cob pipe and after his wife’s death sat all day in his empty office close by a window that was covered with cobwebs.He never opened the window.Once on a hot day in August he tried but found it stuck fast and after that he forgot all about it."
"温斯堡已经忘记了这个老人，但是，瑞非医生这个人身上有些非常优秀的品质。他的办公室在海夫纳街区的巴黎干货公司大楼上。他独自一人在发霉的办公室里无休止地工作，试图把他亲手毁掉的东西重新建立起来。他建起一座座小型真理金字塔，然后再将它们敲碎，这样，他或许就有理由去建立其他的金字塔。","Winesburg had forgotten the old man, but in Doctor Reefy there were the seeds of something very fine.Alone in his musty office in the Heffner Block above the Paris Dry Goods Company’s store, he worked ceaselessly, building up something that he himself destroyed.Little pyramids of truth he erected and after erecting knocked them down again that he might have the truths to erect other pyramids."
"瑞非医生是个高个子，一套衣服穿了十年。衣服的袖子磨损了，膝盖和手肘的地方都有小的破洞。他在办公室里也穿着一件亚麻的防尘服，衣服上有大大的口袋，里面总是被他塞满了纸片。数周后，这些纸片就会变成坚硬的、圆圆的小纸球。当口袋被装满的时候，他就把它们倒在地板上。十年来，他只有一个朋友。那是另一个老头，名叫约翰·斯帕尼亚德；他有一间苗圃。有时，老瑞非医生会开玩笑似的从口袋里掏出一把纸球，朝着苗圃的主人扔过去。“那是用来砸晕你的，你这个唠唠叨叨的老感伤派。”他大声地叫道，然后笑得全身直抖。","Doctor Reefy was a tall man who had worn one suit of clothes for ten years.It was frayed at the sleeves and little holes had appeared at the knees and elbows.In the office he wore also a linen duster with huge pockets into which he continually stuffed scraps of paper.After some weeks the scraps of paper became little hard round balls, and when the pockets were filled he dumped them out upon the floor.For ten years he had but one friend, anothe old man named John Spaniard who owned a tree nursery.Sometimes, in a playful mood, old Doctor Reefy took from his pockets a handful of the paper balls and threw them at the nursery man.“That is to confound you, you blathering old sentimentalist,” he cried, shaking with laughter."
"瑞非医生的故事，还有他向他的妻子——那个高挑的、黑皮肤的姑娘——求爱、结婚，然后获得一大笔遗产的故事非常具有传奇色彩。这个故事很有趣，就像温斯堡果园里长的那种不够圆溜的小苹果一样很美味。秋天里，人们在果园里散步，脚下的土地因结了霜，变得十分坚硬。苹果被工人从树上摘下来。苹果被放进桶里并装船运往各个城市，然后被人们吃掉。被吃掉的地点是在挤满了人，放满了书籍、杂志和家具的公寓里。树上只剩下一些结疤的苹果，工人们一般不会把它们摘下来。它们看起来就像瑞非医生的指关节。咬上一口，真是美味无比。苹果的甜味都集中在边上一个小小的、圆圆的地方。有人会从这棵树跑到那棵树，踩在结了霜的地面上，采摘那些结疤的歪苹果，把口袋装得满满的。只有少数几个人知道这种苹果是甜的。","The story of Doctor Reefy and his courtship of the tall dark girl who became his wife and left her money to him is a very curious story.It is delicious, like the twisted little apples that grow in the orchards of Winesburg.In the fall one walks in the orchards and the ground is hard with frost under-foot.The apples have been taken from the trees by the pickers.They have been put in barrels and shipped to the cities where they will be eaten in apartments that are filled with books, magazines, furniture, and people.On the trees are only a few gnarled apples that the pickers have rejected.They look like the knuckles of Doctor Reefy’s hands.One nibbles at them and they are delicious.Into a little round place at the side of the apple has been gathered all of its sweetness.One runs from tree to tree over the frosted ground picking the gnarled, twisted apples and filling his pockets with them.Only the few know the sweetness of the twisted apples."
"瑞非医生和那个姑娘的爱情故事开始于一个夏日的下午。那时他已四十五岁，已经开始养成把口袋装满纸片，把纸片变成硬硬的纸球，然后扔掉的习惯。当他坐着马车，由一匹疲倦的白马拉着在乡村公路上慢慢行进的时候，这种习惯就养成了。他把所思所想都写在纸上，有的是结尾，有的是开头。","The girl and Doctor Reefy began their courtship on a summer afternoon.He was forty-five then and already he had begun the practice of filling his pockets with the scraps of paper that became hard balls and were thrown away.The habit had been formed as he sat in his buggy behind the jaded white horse and went slowly along country roads.On the papers were written thoughts, ends of thoughts, beginnings of thoughts."
"瑞非医生的念头一个个渐渐变成了思想。众多的思想汇集在一起变成了真理，在他脑海里变成了庞然大物。这个真理遮蔽了整个世界。它先是变得可怕，然后渐渐淡去，但随即那些琐碎的思绪又重新冒了出来。","One by one the mind of Doctor Reefy had made the thoughts.Out of many of them he formed a truth that arose gigantic in his mind.The truth clouded the world.It became terrible and then faded away and the little thoughts began again."
"那个高个子的黑皮肤姑娘来找瑞非医生，是因为她怀了孕，心中惊惶不安。她之所以会沦落到这步田地也是因为一系列奇妙的际遇。","The tall dark girl came to see Doctor Reefy because she was in the family way and had become frightened.She was in that condition because of a series of circumstances also curious."
"她的父母双亡，一大片富饶的土地落到了她手里，这就招致了一大群求婚者尾追不舍。两年内，她几乎每晚都有求婚者。除了两个人以外，其他求婚者都大同小异。他们同她谈论激情，望着她的时候，声音和眼睛里有种压抑的渴望。而这与众不同的两个人，彼此也是截然不同的。其中一位身材颀长的年轻人有着白净的手，是温斯堡一个珠宝商的儿子。他总是不停地同她谈及贞洁。每当他同她相处时，总是提到这个话题。而另一个黑发的男子，长着大耳朵，什么也不说，可总是想方设法地将她拉到暗处，然后开始亲吻她。","The death of her father and mother and the rich acres of land that had come down to her had set a train of suitors on her heels.For two years she saw suitors almost every evening.Except two they were all alike.They talked to her of passion and there was a strained eager quality in their voices and in their eyes when they looked at her.The two who were different were much unlike each other.One of them, a slender young man with white hands, the son of a jeweler in Winesburg, talked continually of virginity.When he was with her he was never off the subject.The other, a black-haired boy with large ears, said nothing at all but always managed to get her into the darkness, where he began to kiss her."
"这个高个的黑姑娘一度曾考虑着应该嫁给珠宝商的儿子。她一言不发地坐上几个小时听他说话，接着她开始感到有些害怕。她觉得，在他关于贞洁的言论表象之下，隐藏着比其他人更加强烈的欲望。有时，在她看来，他说话时是将她的身体抱在手里的。她想象着他用那白净的双手慢慢转动自己的身体，定睛凝视着。夜晚，她梦到他咬了她身上，他的嘴里还滴着血。这样的梦她重复做了三次，然后，她就怀上了那位沉默的求婚者的孩子。他在激情迸发的时刻切切实实地咬在她的肩上，以至于那些牙印多日后还清晰可见。这位姑娘结识了瑞非医生后，似乎不想再离开他。一个清晨，她走进他的办公室，什么都没说，医生却似乎知道她发生了什么事。","For a time the tall dark girl thought she would marry the jeweler’s son.For hours she sat in silence listening as he talked to her and then she began to be afraid of something.Beneath his talk of virginity she began to think there was a lust greater than in all the others.At times it seemed to her that as he talked he was holding her body in his hands.She imagined him turning it slowly about in the white hands and staring at it.At night she dreamed that he had bitten into her body and that his jaws were dripping.She had the dream three times, then she became in the family way to the one who said nothing at all but who in the moment of his passion actually did bite her shoulder so that for days the marks of his teeth showed.After the tall dark girl came to know Doctor Reefy it seemed to her that she never wanted to leave him again.She went into his office one morning and without her saying anything he seemed to know what had happened to her."
"他的办公室里有个女人，是温斯堡书店的老板娘。像所有老式的乡村医师一样，瑞非医生也拔牙。候诊的这个女人用块手帕捂住牙齿在呻吟着。书店老板陪着妻子。当那颗牙被拔出来的时候，他们都尖叫起来，血流到了女人的白色裙子上。可那个高挑的黑姑娘丝毫没有注意。书店老板夫妇离开后，医生笑了起来。“我开车带你去乡下吧。”他说。","In the office of the doctor there was a woman, the wife of the man who kept the bookstore in Winesburg.Like all old-fashioned country practitioners, Doctor Reefy pulled teeth, and the woman who waited held a handkerchief to her teeth and groaned.Her husband was with her and when the tooth was taken out they both screamed and blood ran down on the woman’s white dress.The tall dark girl did not pay any attention.When the woman and the man had gone the doctor smiled.“I will take you driving into the country with me,” he said."
"姑娘和医生好几个星期来几乎天天呆在一起。使姑娘结识医生的那件事经过一场病痛后过去了。但是，她就像那些发现了歪苹果的甜蜜秘密的人一样，对于坐在城市的公寓里吃那些圆溜溜的苹果再也喜欢不起来。在他们结识后的那个秋天，姑娘嫁给了瑞非医生，第二年的春天，她就死了。整个冬天，他把自己写在纸片上的那些零零碎碎的思想都念给她听了。念过之后，他便哈哈大笑，重新把纸片塞进衣袋里，让它们变成又圆又硬的纸球。","For several weeks the tall dark girl and the doctor were together almost every day.The condition that had brought her to him passed in an illness, but she was like one who has discovered the sweetness of the twisted apples, she could not get her mind fixed again upon the round perfect fruit that is eaten in the city apartments.In the fall after the beginning of her acquaintanceship with him she married Doctor Reefy and in the following spring she died.During the winter he read to her all of the odds and ends of thoughts he had scribbled on the bits of paper.After he had read them he laughed and stuffed them away in his pockets to become round hard balls."
"第三章 母亲","Chapter 3 Mother"
"伊丽莎白·威拉德是乔治·威拉德的母亲。她个子很高，看上去十分憔悴，脸上布满着天花留下的伤疤。虽然才四十五岁，可某种不知名的疾病已经熄灭了她的生命之火。她无精打采地在这个杂乱无章、又老又旧的旅馆里转悠，看着那些褪了色的墙纸和残破的地毯；而且，当她能够活动时，她会做些清扫女工干的活儿——收拾那些被肥胖的旅客们睡觉时弄脏的床。可她的丈夫，汤姆·威拉德，身材颀长、气质文雅，有着宽宽的肩膀；走路像军人似的迈着大步，黑色的胡子两头梳得翘了起来；他一心想要把妻子置诸脑后。当他看见她那高高的、幽灵似的身影慢慢地穿过大厅时，总是引以为耻。他一想到她，就会怒火攻心，开始咒骂。旅店也不赚钱，总是在破产的边缘挣扎。他一心想自己能摆脱这个负担。他把这座老房子以及和他一起生活的这个女人看成是否中失败的、没救的东西。他曾经满怀希望地想在这个旅馆里开始新生活，可现如今，这个旅馆形同幽灵。当他衣冠楚楚、煞有介事地在温斯堡大街上穿行的时候，他时常会停下来，迅速地转个身，就好像害怕那旅店和他妻子的幽灵会跟着他跑到街上来似的。“这该死的日子，真该死！”他漫无目的、气急败坏地说。","Elizabeth Willard the mother of George Willard, was tall and gaunt and her face was marked with smallpox scars.Although she was but forty-five, some obscure disease had taken the fire out of her figure.Listlessly she went about the disorderly old hotel looking at the faded wallpaper and the ragged carpets and, when she was able to be about, doing the work of a chambermaid among beds soiled by the slumbers of fat traveling men.Her husband, Tom Willard, a slender, graceful man with square shoulders, a quick military step, and a black mustache trained to turn sharply up at the ends, tried to put the wife out of his mind.The presence of the tall ghostly figure, moving slowly through the halls, he took as a reproach to himself.When he thought of her he grew angry and swore.The hotel was unprofitable and forever on the edge of failure and he wished himself out of it.He thought of the old house and the woman who lived there with him as things defeated and done for.The hotel in which he had begun life so hopefully was now a mere ghost of what a hotel should be.As he went spruce and business-like through the streets of Winesburg, he sometimes stopped and turned quickly about as though fearing that the spirit of the hotel and of the woman would follow him even into the streets.“Damn such a life, damn it!” he sputtered aimlessly."
"汤姆·威拉德对乡村政治怀有极大的热情。多年来，在这个共和党占主导地位的社区，他一直是一名民主党的领军人物。他跟自己说，有朝一日，政治形势会变得有利于我；这么些年来毫无功效的努力，在论功行赏的时候必然会有巨大的回报。他还梦想着进入国会，甚至当上州长。一次，党内一个比他年轻的成员在一次政治会议上站出来，吹嘘自己忠贞不二的表现，汤姆·威拉德为此气得脸色发白，怒火中烧。“你给我闭嘴！”他咆哮着，怒目圆睁，“你懂什么效劳？你不过是个毛头小子？瞧瞧我都做了什么！在温斯堡还没人敢做个民主党人的时候，我就是个民主党人了。过去，他们竟还用枪抓捕过民主党。”","Tom Willard had a passion for village politics and for years had been the leading Democrat in a strongly Republican community.Some day, he told himself, the fide of things political will turn in my favor and the years of ineffectual service count big in the bestowal of rewards.He dreamed of going to Congress and even of becoming governor.Once when a younger member of the party arose at a political conference and began to boast of his faithful service, Tom Willard grew white with fury.“Shut up, you,” he roared, glaring about.“What do you know of service?What are you but a boy?Look at what I’ve done here!I was a Democrat here in Winesburg when it was a crime to be a Democrat.In the old days they fairly hunted us with guns.”"
"伊丽莎白同她唯一的儿子乔治之间联结着一条深切的、难以言说的感情纽带——惺惺相惜之情，源于她少女时候的一个梦，那梦很久以前就泯灭了。同儿子在一起的时候，伊丽莎白是胆怯而保守的。可是，有时乔治在镇上忙忙碌碌、执行记者的公务的时候，她就会来到他的房间，关上门，跪在窗户旁一张小小的、用厨房餐桌改成的书桌旁。就在这个房间的书桌旁，她进行着某种仪式，对着天空念念有词，半是祷告，半是要求。在她儿子身上，她渴望见到某种东西再现，那东西曾经是她的一部分，却已经快被淡忘了。祈祷的内容就是如此。“即使我死去，我也要使你远离失败，”她叫道。她的决心非常强烈，以至于她全身颤抖。她的眼睛灼灼闪光，双拳紧握。“假如我死了，看到我的儿子变成了一个像我一样的无用之辈，我就会回来。”她发誓道，“我恳请上帝现在给予我这种权利。我要求这个特权。我愿意为此付出代价。上帝可以予我以痛击。我情愿承受可能降临的任何打击，只要允许我的儿子能代表我们两个人而有所作为。”她迟疑地停顿了一会儿，开始环顾儿子的房间。“但也不要让他变得精明或者成功。”她模模糊糊地加了一句。","Between Elizabeth and her one son George there was a deep unexpressed bond of sympathy, based on a girlhood dream that had long ago died.In the son’s presence she was timid and reserved, but sometimes while he hurried about town intent upon his duties as a reporter, she went into his room and closing the door knelt by a little desk, made of a kitchen table, that sat near a window.In the room by the desk she went through a ceremony that was half a prayer, half a demand, addressed to the skies.In the boyish figure she yearned to see something half forgotten that had once been a part of herself recreated.The prayer concerned that.“Even though I die, I will in some way keep defeat from you,” she cried, and so deep was her determination that her whole body shook.Her eyes glowed and she clenched her fists.“If I am dead and see him becoming a meaningless drab figure like myself, I will come back,” she declared.“I ask God now to give me that privilege.I demand it.I will pay for it.God may beat me with his fists.I will take any blow that may befall if but this my boy be allowed to express something for us both.”Pausing uncertainly, the woman stared about the boy’s room.“And do not let him become smart and successful either,” she added vaguely."
"乔治·威拉德同他母亲的感情交流从表面上来看中规中矩、别无他意。当她生病，坐在自己房间的窗边时，他有时会在晚上去看望她。他们会靠着窗户坐着，从窗户望出去，目光可越过窗外一户低矮楼房的屋顶看到大街。转过头，他们可以从另一扇窗户看出去，沿着大街店面后的一条巷道，看到阿布纳·格罗夫面包店的后门。有的时候，他们就那么坐着，一副乡村生活的场景就会展现在他们眼前。阿布纳·格罗夫会手拿一根手杖或一个空牛奶瓶从店的后门出来。这位面包店老板同一只灰猫在很长一段时间里势同水火；那只猫的主人是药剂师西尔维斯特·韦斯特。母子俩看见猫偷偷溜进面包店的后门，又马上出来了，猫后面紧跟着面包店老板；他挥舞着胳膊，大声咒骂着。他小小的眼睛充着血，黑色的头发和胡子上都沾满了面粉。有时，他大发雷霆，尽管猫都跑得不见踪影了，他还在到处猛扔木棍、玻璃碎片，甚至是他做生意用的家伙。有一次，他甚至砸碎了思宁五金店的一扇后窗。那只灰猫经常蹲伏在小巷里的几个木桶后；桶里装满了碎纸片和破酒瓶，一大群黑压压的苍蝇在上面飞来飞去。有一次，伊丽莎白独自坐在那里，看到面包店老板徒劳地发了很久的脾气之后，她把头俯在自己纤长而白皙的手上，哭了起来。从那以后，她再也不往小巷里张望了，而且极力忘记这场面包师和灰猫之间的战争。那就像她自己生活的一场预演，活灵活现得可怕。","The communion between George Willard and his mother was outwardly a formal thing without meaning.When she was ill and sat by the window in her room he sometimes went in the evening to make her a visit.They sat by a window that looked over the roof of a small frame building into Main Street.By turning their heads they could see through another window, along an alleyway that ran behind the Main Street stores and into the back door of Abner Groff’s bakery.Sometimes as they sat thus a picture of village life presented itself to them.At the back door of his shop appeared Abner Groff with a stick or an empty milk bottle in his hand.For a long time there was a feud between the baker and a grey cat that belonged to Sylvester West, the druggist.The boy and his mother saw the cat creep into the door of the bakery and presently emerge followed by the baker, who swore and waved his arms about.The baker’s eyes were small and red and his black hair and beard were filled with flour dust.Sometimes he was so angry that, although the cat had disappeared, he hurled sticks, bits of broken glass, and even some of the tools of his trade about.Once he broke a window at the back of Sinning’s Hardware Store.In the alley the grey cat crouched behind barrels filled with torn paper and broken bottles above which flew a black swarm of flies.Once when she was alone, and after watching a prolonged and ineffectual outburst on the part of the baker, Elizabeth Willard put her head down on her long white hands and wept.After that she did not look along the alleyway any more, but tried to forget the contest between the bearded man and the cat.It seemed like a rehearsal of her own life, terrible in its vividness."
"晚上，母子俩坐在房间里时，沉默的气氛让他们都感到尴尬难堪。夜幕降临，晚班车驶进车站。楼下街道上，沉重的脚步声在木板人行道上来来往往。夜班车开走后，车站里一片寂静。也许此时列车代理人斯金纳·利生正在移动一辆卡车，足有整个车站月台那么长。前面的大街上传来了一个男人的大笑声。列车办公室的门被人敲得砰砰响。乔治站起身来，穿过房间，在黑暗里摸索着找门把。有时他会撞在椅子上，椅子在地板上摩擦发出声响。母亲靠窗坐着，一动不动，无精打采。她那双纤长的、苍白而毫无血色的手，无力地垂在扶手的两边。“我想你最好出门去找你的年轻朋友们。你呆在屋里的时间太多了。”她说，竭力消除分别时的尴尬。“我想我该去散会儿步。”乔治回答，心里觉得尴尬又心烦。","In the evening when the son sat in the room with his mother, the silence made them both feel awkward.Darkness came on and the evening train came in at the station.In the street below feet tramped up and down upon a board sidewalk.In the station yard, after the evening train had gone, there was a heavy silence.Perhaps Skinner Leason, the express agent, moved a truck the length of the station platform.Over on Main Street sounded a man’s voice, laughing.The door of the express office banged.George Willard arose and crossing the room fumbled for the doorknob.Sometimes he knocked against a chair, making it scrape along the floor.By the window sat the sick woman, perfectly still, listless.Her long hands, white and bloodless, could be seen drooping over the ends of the arms of the chair.“I think you had better be out among the boys.You are too much indoors,” she said, striving to relieve the embarrassment of the departure.“I thought I would take a walk,” replied George Willard, who felt awkward and confused."
"七月，在新威拉德旅店投宿的短期旅客数量减少了。一个夜晚，只点着煤油灯的走廊昏暗不明，显得低矮。伊丽莎白进行了一次难忘的探险。她已卧病在床了好几天，可乔治没有来看望她。她忧虑不安。因为焦虑，她体内微弱的生命余烬被煽动起来，变成了熊熊火焰。她爬下床，穿上衣服，沿着走廊急忙往儿子的房间走去，全身因为被放大的恐惧而簌簌发抖。她用手支撑自己走着，沿着大厅的墙纸悄然疾行，呼吸困难。气流从她的牙齿缝间呼呼吹过。就在她往前赶的时候，她又觉得自己非常愚蠢。“他在忙男孩子该干的事情呢，”她暗自想，“也许他现在已经开始和姑娘们一起在夜里散步呢。”","One evening in July, when the transient guests who made the New Willard House their temporary home had become scarce, and the hallways, lighted only by kerosene lamps turned low, were plunged in gloom, Elizabeth Willard had an adventure.She had been ill in bed for several days and her son had not come to visit her.She was alarmed.The feeble blaze of life that remained in her body was blown into a flame by her anxiety and she crept out of bed, dressed and hurried along the hallway toward her son’s room, shaking with exaggerated fears.As she went along she steadied herself with her hand, slipped along the papered walls of the hall and breathed with difficulty.The air whistled through her teeth.As she hurried forward she thought how foolish she was.“He is concerned with boyish affairs,” she told herself.“Perhaps he has now begun to walk about in the evening with girls.”"
"伊丽莎白害怕在旅店里被客人看见。这家旅店过去是她父亲的产业，现在在乡公所的记录里归在她的名下。旅店简陋，不断地失去主顾。现在，她觉得自己也是破旧不堪的了。她的房间在一个不起眼的角落里。当她觉得还能干些事情的时候，她会主动去整理床铺。客人们外出同温斯堡的商户做生意的时候，她愿意做些力所能及的事。","Elizabeth Willard had a dread of being seen by guests in the hotel that had once belonged to her father and the ownership of which still stood recorded in her name in the county courthouse.The hotel was continually losing patronage because of its shabbiness and she thought of herself as also shabby.Her own room was in an obscure corner and when she felt able to work she voluntarily worked among the beds, preferring the labor that could be done when the guests were abroad seeking trade among the merchants of Winesburg."
"母亲跪在儿子房门外的地板上，听着屋里面传出来的响声。等她听见儿子走动和低声说话的时候，唇角浮现出了微笑。乔治有高声自言自语的习惯。每当听见他这样说话的时候，伊丽莎白都会感到特别愉快。在母亲看来，他的这个习惯强化了母子间的那层神秘的关系。她无数次跟自己悄声谈及这个问题。“他正在努力探寻，发掘自我。”她想道，“他不是个迟钝的孩子，能言善道，而且机灵。他身上有种神秘的东西在努力壮大。那正是我曾拥有却被扼杀了的东西。”生病的母亲从走廊门前的地板上直起身来，在黑暗里重新朝着自己的房间走回去。她怕儿子会打开门撞见她。当她到了一个安全的距离，马上要转个弯到另一条走廊上的时候，她才停下来。她用手撑着自己，等了一会儿，想着撑过这一阵因身体虚弱而引起的颤抖。儿子呆在房间里，这让她十分高兴。在她独自躺在床上的漫长时光里，拜访她的那些小小的担忧曾经变成了巨人。可现在都烟消云散了。“回到房间我就该睡了。”她心怀感激地喃喃说道。","By the door of her son’s room the mother knelt upon the floor and listened for some sound from within.When she heard the boy moving about and talking in low tones a smile came to her lips.George Willard had a habit of talking aloud to himself and to hear him doing so had always given his mother a peculiar pleasure.The habit in him, she felt, strengthened the secret bond that existed between them.A thousand times she had whispered to herself of the matter.“He is groping about, trying to find himself,” she thought.“He is not a dull clod, all words and smartness.Within him there is a secret something that is striving to grow.It is the thing I let be killed in myself.”In the darkness in the hallway by the door the sick woman arose and started again toward her own room.She was afraid that the door would open and the boy come upon her.When she had reached a safe distance and was about to turn a corner into a second hallway she stopped and bracing herself with her hands waited, thinking to shake off a trembling fit of weakness that had come upon her.The presence of the boy in the room had made her happy.In her bed, during the long hours alone, the little fears that had visited her had become giants.Now they were all gone.“When I get back to my room I shall sleep,” she murmured gratefully."
"但是，她不能回到床上睡觉了。当她在黑暗中颤抖着站起来的时候，儿子的门打开了，走出来的却是她的丈夫汤姆·威拉德。他站在门开着的亮光中，手扶着门把，说着话。他的话立刻激怒了这位母亲。","But Elizabeth Willard was not to return to her bed and to sleep.As she stood trembling in the darkness the door of her son’s room opened and the boy’s father, Tom Willard, stepped out.In the light that steamed out at the door he stood with the knob in his hand and talked.What he said infuriated the woman."
"汤姆·威拉德对儿子有很高的期望。他一直自认为是个成功的男人，尽管他从没做成过一件成功的事。但是，一旦他离开新威拉德旅店，而且不用担心会碰见自己的妻子的时候，他便大摇大摆地开始扮演这个城镇上的大人物。他想要他的儿子成功。是他为儿子在《温斯堡鹰报》谋得了一个职位。此时，他正用一种恳切的语气就为人之道对儿子进行说教。“我告诉你，乔治，你得醒醒了。”他严厉地说，“就这个问题，威尔·亨德森已经对我说过三次了。他说你很长一段时间都对他说的话充耳不闻，行动起来像个傻里傻气的姑娘。你有什么烦心事吗？”汤姆·威拉德和善地笑了起来。“我想你会改掉这个毛病的。”他说，“我是这样告诉威尔的。你既不傻也不是个娘娘腔。你是我汤姆·威拉德的儿子，你会打起精神来的。我一点儿都不担心。你所说的证明了这一点。即使当记者使你产生了当作家的念头，那也是可以的。只不过我想你总得振作起来努把力吧，嗯？”","Tom Willard was ambitious for his son.He had always thought of himself as a successful man, although nothing he had ever done had turned out successfully.However, when he was out of sight of the New Willard House and had no fear of coming upon his wife, he swaggered and began to dramatize himself as one of the chief men of the town.He wanted his son to succeed.He it was who had secured for the boy the position on the Winesburg Eagle.Now, with a ring of earnestness in his voice, he was advising concerning some course of conduct.“I tell you what, George, you’ve got to wake up,” he said sharply.“Will Henderson has spoken to me three times concerning the matter.He says you go along for hours not hearing when you are spoken to and acting like a gawky girl.What ails you?”Tom Willard laughed good-naturedly.“Well, I guess you’ll get over it,” he said.“I told Will that.You’re not a fool and you’re not a woman.You’re Tom Willard’s son and you’ll wake up.I’m not afraid.What you say clears things up.If being a newspaper man had put the notion of becoming a writer into your mind that’s all right.Only I guess you’ll have to wake up to do that too, eh?”"
"汤姆步履轻快地沿着走廊下了一段楼梯，进了自己的办公室。伊丽莎白在黑暗里能听见他大笑的声音，还有他同一个顾客的谈话声。那位客人坐在靠近办公室门边的椅子上，打着瞌睡，试图以此来消磨枯燥的夜晚。她返身往儿子的房门走去。身体虚弱奇迹般地消失了，她大胆自信地向前走着。她脑袋里飞快地闪过无数念头。当听到椅子摩擦地面的声音和笔落在纸上的沙沙声时，她重又转过身，沿着来时的走廊往自己的房间走去。","Tom Willard went briskly along the hallway and down a flight of stairs to the office.The woman in the darkness could hear him laughing and talking with a guest who was striving to wear away a dull evening by dozing in a chair by the office door.She returned to the door of her son’s room.The weakness had passed from her body as by a miracle and she stepped boldly along.A thousand ideas raced through her head.When she heard the scraping of a chair and the sound of a pen scratching upon paper, she again turned and went back along the hallway to her own room."
"这位失败的妻子——温斯堡旅店的老板娘——在心里做了一个不可动摇的决定。这个决定是长年累月思考的结果，尽管这种思考是无声而且毫无成效的。“现在，” 她对自己说，“我得做点什么了。有件事情正在威胁着我的孩子，我不能让它发生。”父子间刚才的谈话平静而自然，就好像他们之间相互理解一样。这样的事实使她抓狂。多年以来，尽管伊丽莎白恨自己的丈夫，她的憎恨之前一直是以一种置身事外的形式存在着。他不过是她所恨着的某件不相干的东西的一部分。可是现在，他在门边说的那几句话，使他变成了一个活生生的可恨之人。她站在自己黑暗的房间里，紧握着拳头，愤怒地环顾四周。她走到墙边，从挂在钉子上的布袋里取出一把长长的缝纫剪刀，像把匕首似的握在手里。“我要捅死他。”她大声地说,“他自己选择了当魔鬼的代言人，我要杀了他。一旦我杀了他，我的生命也会中止，我也会死掉。这样我们就都解脱了。”","A definite determination had come into the mind of the defeated wife of the Winesburg hotel keeper.The determination was the result of long years of quiet and rather ineffectual thinking.“Now,” she told herself, “I will act.There is something threatening my boy and I will ward it off.”The fact that the conversation between Tom Willard and his son had been rather quiet and natural, as though an understanding existed between them, maddened her.Although for years she had hated her husband, her hatred had always before been a quite impersonal thing.He had been merely a part of something else that she hated.Now, and by the few words at the door, he had become the thing personified.In the darkness of her own room she clenched her fists and glared about.Going to a cloth bag that hung on a nail by the wall she took out a long pair of sewing scissors and held them in her hand like a dagger.“I will stab him,” she said aloud.“He has chosen to be the voice of evil and I will kill him.When I have killed him something will snap within myself and I will die also.It will be a release for all of us.”"
"在她的少女时代，在嫁给汤姆·威拉德之前，伊丽莎白在温斯堡的名声就不大好。多年来，她一直想做演员，曾经穿着花哨的衣服，跟她父亲旅店里的客人一起在街上招摇过市。那些人来自不同的城市，她总追着他们给她讲述那里的生活。有一次，她穿着男人的衣服，在大街上骑自行车，把全镇的人都吓了一跳。","In her girlhood and before her marriage with Tom Willard, Elizabeth had borne a somewhat shaky reputation in Winesburg.For years she had been what is called “stage-struck” and had paraded through the streets with traveling men guests at her father’s hotel, wearing loud clothes and urging them to tell her of life in the cities out of which they had come.Once she startled the town by putting on men’s clothes and riding a bicycle down Main Street."
"在那段日子里，这个高个子、黑皮肤的姑娘心里很混乱。内心巨大的躁动通过两个途径被释放了出来。首先，她渴望变化，渴望生活能发生大而明确的变化，尽管这种渴望会使她感到焦虑不安。正是这种情感使得她将注意力转向了舞台。她梦想能加入某个剧团，然后周游世界，不停地结识新的人，将自己的某些东西展现给所有人看。有时，她在夜晚想得如痴如醉，不能自已。但是，当她试着同一些来温斯堡住在她父亲旅店的剧团谈这个问题的时候，她却一无所获。他们似乎弄不明白她在说什么，或者，当她确实表达出了自己强烈的感情时，他们却只是哈哈大笑。“事情并非你想的样子。”他们说，“哪里都一样，和这里一样地乏味无趣。没什么结果的。”","In her own mind the tall dark girl had been in those days much confused.A great restlessness was in her and it expressed itself in two ways.First there was an uneasy desire for change, for some big definite movement to her life.It was this feeling that had turned her mind to the stage.She dreamed of joining some company and wandering over the world, seeing always new faces and giving something out of herself to all people.Sometimes at night she was quite beside herself with the thought, but when she tried to talk of the matter to the members of the theatrical companies that came to Winesburg and stopped at her father’s hotel, she got nowhere.They did not seem to know what she meant, or if she did get something of her passion expressed, they only laughed.“It’s not like that,” they said.“It’s as dull and uninteresting as this here.Nothing comes of it.”"
"同那些旅行的人一起四处散步及后来同汤姆·威拉德在一起，却是极为不同的。他们似乎总能理解她，并赞同她。在乡村的小路上，在树下的阴影里，他们握住她的手，她觉得体内某种未表达出的东西释放了出来，并化作了他们身上未表现出的某种东西的一部分。","With the traveling men when she walked about with them, and later with Tom Willard, it was quite different.Always they seemed to understand and sympathize with her.On the side streets of the village, in the darkness under the trees, they took hold of her hand and she thought that something unexpressed in herself came forth and became a part of an unexpressed something in them."
"这便是她释放躁动的第二种方式。每当那时，她都会一度感到放松和快乐。她既没有责备那些同她散步的人，后来，她也没有责备汤姆·威拉德。事情总是这样，从亲吻开始，经历了奇怪的激情之后，归于平静，最后是哭泣着忏悔。当她哭泣时，会把手放在那个男人的脸上，心里总有相同的想法。即使对方身材高大、满脸胡子，她也觉得他突然变成了小男孩。她奇怪为什么他不和她一样哭泣。","And then there was the second expression of her restlessness.When that came she felt for a time released and happy.She did not blame the men who walked with her and later she did not blame Tom Willard.It was always the same, beginning with kisses and ending, after strange wild emotions, with peace and then sobbing repentance.When she sobbed she put her hand upon the face of the man and had always the same thought.Even though he were large and bearded she thought he had become suddenly a little boy.She wondered why he did not sob also."
"她的房间位于这间旅店的一个角落里。伊丽莎白·威拉德在她房里点了盏灯，并将灯放在门边的梳妆台上。她忽然想到了什么，走到壁橱前，拿出一个小的方盒子，放在桌子上。盒子里装着化妆用的材料，是一个剧团滞留在温斯堡镇的时候留下来的；他们还留了其他东西。伊丽莎白觉得她该弄得漂亮些。她的头发依旧乌黑，厚厚的头发编成发辫盘在头上。接下来在楼下办公室将要发生的情景开始在她脑海里预演。一个像幽灵一样憔悴的人影是无法同汤姆·威拉德对抗的，除非是某种很出人意料、令人吃惊的东西。一个高高的人影，双颊灰白，头发大片地垂过肩膀，会大步地走下楼梯，来到旅店办公室，站在目瞪口呆的闲人面前。这个人影将是沉默的——行动迅猛而可怕。她将会像护卫受到威胁的幼仔的母虎一样，无声无息地从阴暗的地方出现，潜行，手里紧握着长长的凶器。","In her room, tucked away in a corner of the old Willard House, Elizabeth Willard lighted a lamp and put it on a dressing table that stood by the door.A thought had come into her mind and she went to a closet and brought out a small square box and set it on the table.The box contained material for make-up and had been left with other things by a theatrical company that had once been stranded in Winesburg.Elizabeth Willard had decided that she would be beautiful.Her hair was still black and there was a great mass of it braided and coiled about her head.The scene that was to take place in the office below began to grow in her mind.No ghostly worn-out figure should confront Tom Willard, but something quite unexpected and startling.Tall and with dusky cheeks and hair that fell in a mass from her shoulders, a figure should come striding down the stairway before the startled loungers in the hotel office.The figure would be silent—it would be swift and terrible.As a tigress whose cub had been threatened would she appear, coming out of the shadows, stealing noiselessly along and holding the long wicked scissors in her hand."
"伊丽莎白低低地发出一声伤心的呜咽，吹灭了桌上的灯，虚弱地站在黑暗中发抖。身体里那股奇迹般的力量已经消失，她几乎是踉踉跄跄地穿过地板，紧紧抓住椅背。在这张椅子上，她曾度过了漫长的岁月——坐在上面越过锡制的屋顶，望着温斯堡的大街。走廊里响起了脚步声，接着，乔治从门外走了进来。他坐在母亲身边的椅子上，开始说话。“我打算离开这儿。”他说，“我不知道该去哪儿，也不知道该做什么，但我要离开了。”","With a little broken sob in her throat, Elizabeth Willard blew out the light that stood upon the table and stood weak and trembling in the darkness.The strength that had been as a miracle in her body left and she half reeled across the floor, clutching at the back of the chair in which she had spent so many long days staring out over the tin roofs into the main street of Winesburg.In the hallway there was the sound of footsteps and George Willard came in at the door.Sitting in a chair beside his mother he began to talk.“I’m going to get out of here,” he said.“I don’t know where I shall go or what I shall do but I am going away.”"
"这位母亲坐在椅子上，等着，颤抖不已。她感到一阵冲动。“我想你该醒醒了。”她说，“你在想什么？跑到城市里，然后赚些钱，是吗？你可能认为这对你比较适合——做个商人，自信、干练、精明，然后就这么活着？”她等了等，不停地颤抖。","The woman in the chair waited and trembled.An impulse came to her.“I suppose you had better wake up,” she said.“You think that?You will go to the city and make money, eh?It will be better for you, you think, to be a business man, to be brisk and smart and alive?”She waited and trembled."
"儿子摇了摇头。“我想我无法让您明白，但是，我真希望我能做到啊。”他恳切地说，“我甚至不能和爸爸谈这个。我不会去试的。没什么意义。我真不知道该做什么。我只不过想出去走走，看看其他人，思考一下。”","The son shook his head.“I suppose I can’t make you understand, but oh, I wish I could,” he said earnestly.“I can’t even talk to father about it.I don’t try.There isn’t any use.I don’t know what I shall do.I just want to go away and look at people and think.”"
"母子俩一起坐在那里，又一次沉默相对。于是，像无数个夜晚那样，他们感到尴尬。过了一会儿，儿子试着重新开口。“我想这用不了一两年，可我一直想这么做。”他站起来，向门走去，说道，“爸爸说的话让我更加确信，是时候出去走走了。”他摸索着门把。房间里，沉默变得让这位母亲难以忍受。儿子刚才所说的话使她欢喜得想要大叫出来，可是对她而言，欢乐的表情已变得不可能。“我想你最好出去找伙伴们。你呆在屋里的时间太多了。”她说。“我想，我该出去走走。”儿子回答，同时极不自然地大步走出了房间，关上了门。","Silence fell upon the room where the boy and woman sat together.Again, as on the other evenings, they were embarrassed.After a time the boy tried again to talk.“I suppose it won’t be for a year or two but I’ve been thinking about it,” he said, rising and going toward the door.“Something father said makes it sure that I shall have to go away.”He fumbled with the doorknob.In the room the silence became unbearable to the woman.She wanted to cry out with joy because of the words that had come from the lips of her son, but the expression of joy had become impossible to her.“I think you had better go out among the boys.You are too much indoors,” she said.“I thought I would go for a little walk,” replied the son stepping awkwardly out of the room and closing the door."
"第四章 哲学家","Chapter 4 The Philosopher"
"帕斯瓦尔医生身材高大，嘴角下垂，留着一撇黄色的小胡子。他总穿着一件脏兮兮的白马甲，口袋里鼓鼓囊囊地塞满了廉价细长的黑雪茄。他的牙齿发黑、十分不整齐，眼睛也有些奇怪。左眼皮总在抽搐，落下去又猛地睁开，活像一扇百叶窗，并且有人站在他脑袋里面，把玩着那根窗绳。","Doctor Parcival was a large man with a drooping mouth covered by a yellow mustache.He always wore a dirty white waistcoat out of the pockets of which protruded a number of the kind of black cigars known as stogies.His teeth were black and irregular and there was something strange about his eyes.The lid of the left eye twitched; it fell down and snapped up; it was exactly as though the lid of the eye were a window shade and someone stood inside the doctor’s head playing with the cord."
"帕斯瓦尔医生特别喜欢一个年轻人——乔治·威拉德。事情开始于乔治在《温斯堡鹰报》工作的一年后。他们的交情全是医生的一厢情愿。","Doctor Parcival had a liking for the boy, George Willard.It began when George had been working for a year on the Winesburg Eagle and the acquaintanceship was entirely a matter of the doctor’s own making."
"某个傍晚，《鹰报》的老板兼主编——威尔·亨德森前往汤姆·威利的酒吧。他沿着小巷走，悄悄从酒吧的后门进去,然后喝一种掺苏打水的黑刺李杜松子酒。威尔·亨德森是个好色之徒，已经四十五岁了。他觉着杜松子酒能让他青春焕发。同大多数酒色之徒一样，他也喜欢谈论女人。他在那里逗留了一个小时，同汤姆·威利闲谈风月。酒吧的老板是个矮个子的男人，肩膀很宽，手上有种特殊的记号。那是一种胎记。人们有时会在男人或女人的脸上见到，红红的，就像火焰。汤姆·威利的手指和手背上就有这种红色的胎记。他站在吧台边上同威利·亨德森聊天的时候，不停地搓着手。随着他变得越来越兴奋，手指上的红色也变深了。这情景就好像是之前手曾被浸入血中，只不过血已经变干、变淡了。","In the late afternoon Will Henderson, owner and editor of the Eagle, went over to Tom Willy’s saloon.Along an alleyway he went and slipping in at the back door of the saloon began drinking a drink made of a combination of sloe gin and soda water.Will Henderson was a sensualist and had reached the age of forty-five.He imagined the gin renewed the youth in him.Like most sensualists he enjoyed talking of women, and for an hour he lingered about gossiping with Tom Willy.The saloon keeper was a short, broad-shouldered man with peculiarly marked hands.That flaming kind of birthmark that sometimes paints with red the faces of men and women had touched with red Tom Willy’s fingers and the backs of his hands.As he stood by the bar talking to Will Henderson he rubbed the hands together.As he grew more and more excited the red of his fingers deepened.It was as though the hands had been dipped in blood that had dried and faded."
"当威利·亨德森在酒吧看着这双红色的手闲谈风月的时候，他的助手乔治·威拉德正坐在《温斯堡鹰报》的办公室里，聆听帕斯瓦尔医生的高见。","As Will Henderson stood at the bar looking at the red hands and talking of women, his assistant, George Willard, sat in the office of the Winesburg Eagle and listened to the talk of Doctor Parcival."
"威尔·亨德森刚离开报社，这位医生就来了。这让人不禁怀疑，这位医生是否一直在从他办公室的窗户里监视这里，并且看到主编大人拐进了那条小巷。他从前门一进来，就给自己找了把椅子坐下，然后点了根廉价细长的雪茄，跷起二郎腿，聊了起来。看起来，他是打算说服这个年轻人采纳某种连他自己都无法界定的做人之道。","Doctor Parcival appeared immediately after Will Henderson had disappeared.One might have supposed that the doctor had been watching from his office window and had seen the editor going along the alleyway.Coming in at the front door and finding himself a chair, he lighted one of the stogies and crossing his legs began to talk.He seemed intent upon convincing the boy of the advisability of adopting a line of conduct that he was himself unable to define."
"“如果你留意过的话，你会发现，虽然我自称医生，其实并没有几个病人。”他开口说道，“这是有原因的。这不是种偶然，也不是因为我比这儿的任何人都学艺不精。我不想给人看病。你该明白，这个原因不是浮在表面上的。它是由于我的性格。如果你仔细想想，就会发现我性格里有很多奇怪的地方。我也不明白为什么我想把这件事告诉你。我可以保持沉默，然后获得你更多的信任。事实上，我倒很希望你能仰慕我。我也不知道这是怎么回事。所以想同你谈谈。这很有趣，不是吗？”","“If you have your eyes open you will see that although I call myself a doctor I have mighty few patients,” he began.“There is a reason for that.It is not an accident and it is not because I do not know as much of medicine as anyone here.I do not want patients.The reason, you see, does not appear on the surface.It lies in fact in my character, which has, if you think about it, many strange turns.Why I want to talk to you of the matter I don’t know.I might keep still and get more credit in your eyes.I have a desire to make you admire me, that’s a fact.I don’t know why.That’s why I talk.It’s very amusing, eh?”"
"时不时地，这位医生会对他自己的经历大谈特谈一番。在年轻人听来，那些故事是非常真实、意味深长的。他开始对这位胖胖的、看上去很邋遢的人心生敬仰。每当威尔·亨德森下午离开时，他就很期待那位医生的光临。","Sometimes the doctor launched into long tales concerning himself.To the boy the tales were very real and full of meaning.He began to admire the fat unclean-looking man and, in the afternoon when Will Henderson had gone, looked forward with keen interest to the doctor’s coming."
"帕斯瓦尔医生来温斯堡镇有五年了。他来自芝加哥。到这儿的时候酩酊大醉，还同脚夫阿尔伯特·朗沃思打了一架。打架的起因源于一个行李箱，结果是医生被押往村拘留所。等到他被释放后，他就在大街街尾的一家修鞋店的楼上租了个房间，挂牌行医了。尽管他没几个病人，有也是穷得付不了诊费的，可他看起来生活阔绰，足以满足自己的所需。他睡在脏得没法形容的诊室里，在火车站对面一间名叫比夫·卡特午餐厅的小木屋里吃饭。夏天的时候，午餐厅里飞满了苍蝇；老板身上的围裙比地板还要脏。可帕斯瓦尔医生一点也不介意。他满不在乎地走进午餐厅，扔了二十美分在柜台上。“随便给我弄些吃的。”他笑着说，“用你卖不出去的菜就行了。我无所谓的。我是个有身份的人，你知道的。我不会在乎吃的东西。”","Doctor Parcival had been in Winesburg about five years.He came from Chicago and when he arrived was drunk and got into a fight with Albert Longworth, the baggageman.The fight concerned a trunk and ended by the doctor’s being escorted to the village lockup.When he was released he rented a room above a shoe-repairing shop at the lower end of Main Street and put out the sign that announced himself as a doctor.Although he had but few patients and these of the poorer sort who were unable to pay, he seemed to have plenty of money for his needs.He slept in the office that was unspeakably dirty and dined at Biff Carter’s lunch room in a small frame building opposite the railroad station.In the summer the lunch room was filled with flies and Biff Carter’s white apron was more dirty than his floor.Doctor Parcival did not mind.Into the lunch room he stalked and deposited twenty cents upon the counter.“Feed me what you wish for that,” he said laughing.“Use up food that you wouldn’t otherwise sell.It makes no difference to me.I am a man of distinction, you see.Why should I concern myself with what I eat.”"
"医生说给乔治听的故事都是没头没尾的。有时候，乔治觉得那都是他杜撰的，一派胡言。可接下来，他又坚信故事里包含了真谛。","The tales that Doctor Parcival told George Willard began nowhere and ended nowhere.Sometimes the boy thought they must all be inventions, a pack of lies.And then again he was convinced that they contained the very essence of truth."
"“我做过记者，和你在这儿一样。”帕斯瓦尔医生开口说，“是在艾奥瓦州或是伊利诺伊州的一个小镇？我记不清了，反正这不重要。或许我正在试图隐瞒我的身份，不想被人看穿。你是不是也觉得奇怪？我虽然无所事事，可还衣食无忧。也许在来这里之前，我偷过一大笔钱，又或者，涉及过一场谋杀案。这些都能让人浮想联翩，不是吗？你要真是个机灵点儿的记者，你就该调查调查我。芝加哥有个名叫克罗宁的医生被人谋杀。你听说了吗？有些人杀了他，然后把尸体装进一个箱子。清晨，他们把箱子从城市一头拖到另一头。他们把它放在一辆高速货车后面，然后，若无其事地坐在座位上。他们静悄悄地穿过城市的大街小巷，那时人们还在睡觉呢。太阳刚从湖面上升起来。有趣吧——想想看，他们抽着烟斗，赶着车，若无其事地聊着天，就像我现在这个样子。或许我就是其中之一。现在事情就会出现奇怪的变化了，你说是吗？”医生又开始往下讲：“嗯，无论如何我都在那儿做过报社记者，就像你现在这样。四处跑跑，找点小新闻，登在报纸上。我妈妈是个穷人。她靠给人洗衣服谋生。她的梦想是让我当个长老会的牧师，我就为这个读的书。","“I was a reporter like you here,” Doctor Parcival began.“It was in a town in Iowa—or was it in Illinois?I don’t remember and anyway it makes no difference.Perhaps I am trying to conceal my identity and don’t want to be very definite.Have you ever thought it strange that I have money for my needs although I do nothing?I may have stolen a great sum of money or been involved in a murder before I came here.There is food for thought in that, eh?If you were a really smart newspaper reporter you would look me up.In Chicago there was a Doctor Cronin who was murdered.Have you heard of that?Some men murdered him and put him in a trunk.In the early morning they hauled the trunk across the city.It sat on the back of an express wagon and they were on the seat as unconcerned as anything.Along they went through quiet streets where everyone was asleep.The sun was just coming up over the lake.Funny, eh—just to think of them smoking pipes and chattering as they drove along as unconcerned as I am now.Perhaps I was one of those men.That would be a strange turn of things, now wouldn’t it, eh?”Again Doctor Parcival began his tale: “Well, anyway there I was, a reporter on a paper just as you are here, running about and getting little items to print.My mother was poor.She took in washing.Her dream was to make me a Presbyterian minister and I was studying with that end in view."
"“我爸疯了很多年。他呆在俄亥俄州代顿的一家精神病院里。你看，我不小心说漏嘴了！所有一切都发生在这里，就在俄亥俄州。如果你有心要调查我，这就是个线索。”","“My father had been insane for a number of years.He was in an asylum over at Dayton, Ohio.There you see I have let it slip out!All of this took place in Ohio, right here in Ohio.There is a clew if you ever get the notion of looking me up.”"
"“我打算跟你说说我的兄弟。这才是我的真正意图。我马上要讲到正题了。他是个铁路油漆工，在四大铁路公司工作。你知道铁路穿过俄亥俄州。他和其他工人一起住在货柜车厢里，往返于各个城镇间，给铁路设施涂漆——开关、闸门、桥梁和车站。”","“I was going to tell you of my brother.That’s the object of all this.That’s what I’m getting at.My brother was a railroad painter and had a job on the Big Four.You know that road runs through Ohio here.With other men he lived in a box car and away they went from town to town painting the railroad property—switches, crossing gates, bridges, and stations.”"
"“四大铁路公司的车站涂的是那种令人恶心的橘红色油漆。我真讨厌这种颜色！我的兄弟身上总有这种颜色。发薪水的时候，他常喝得烂醉，回家时穿着那件满是油漆的衣服，身上带着钱。他从不把钱给母亲，就那么摞成一摞堆在厨房的桌上。”","“The Big Four paints its stations a nasty orange color.How I hated that color!My brother was always covered with it.On pay days he used to get drunk and come home wearing his paint-covered clothes and bringing his money with him.He did not give it to mother but laid it in a pile on our kitchen table.”"
"“他总穿着那件满是橘红色油漆的恶心衣服在房里走动。我现在还能回忆起那个场景。我的母亲很瘦小，眼睛红红的，表情悲伤，总是从后门的一个小棚子走进房子里。那是她洗衣服的地方，她每天趴在洗衣盆上刷洗别人的脏衣服。她会走进来站在桌子边上，用围裙揉揉眼睛，围裙上满是肥皂沫。”","“About the house he went in the clothes covered with the nasty orange colored paint.I can see the picture.My mother, who was small and had red, sad-looking eyes, would come into the house from a little shed at the back.That’s where she spent her time over the washtub scrubbing people’s dirty clothes.In she would come and stand by the table, rubbing her eyes with her apron that was covered with soap-suds.”"
"“‘别碰！看谁敢动那钱！’我的兄弟咆哮着说。接着，他就拿着五或十美元，踏着沉重的脚步往酒吧去了。等他花光了拿去的钱，他就回家来再拿。他从不给母亲一分钱。每次都呆在外面直到把钱花光，一次花一点儿。之后，他就和别的油漆工回铁路上去上班了。他走之后，蔬菜和一些生活用品就源源不断地被送到家里来。有时，会带回给妈妈的裙子，或是给我的鞋。”","“‘Don’t touch it!Don’t you dare touch that money,’ my brother roared, and then he himself took five or ten dollars and went tramping off to the saloons.When he had spent what he had taken he came back for more.He never gave my mother any money at all but stayed about until he had spent it all, a little at a time.Then he went back to his job with the painting crew on the railroad.After he had gone things began to arrive at our house, groceries and such things.Sometimes there would be a dress for mother or a pair of shoes for me.”"
"“很奇特，对不对？虽然他没对我们说过一句好话，还总是暴跳如雷地威胁我们不准动他放在桌上的钱——哪怕那钱会放上三天，可我母亲还是更偏爱他些。”","“Strange, eh?My mother loved my brother much more than she did me, although he never said a kind word to either of us and always raved up and down threatening us if we dared so much as touch the money that sometimes lay on the table three days.”"
"“我们关系很好。我为了做牧师读书，还祈祷。我祷告时就是个不折不扣的蠢蛋。你真该听听。我爸死的时候，我祈祷了一整晚。我兄弟在镇上喝酒、忙着给我们买东西的时候，我也时常这样为大家祈祷。晚饭过后，我会跪在放钱的桌子旁，祈祷好几个小时。趁着没人注意，从桌上偷一两块，放进自己的口袋。现在我说起来觉得好笑，可在那时，真是胆战心惊。我一直都记得这件事。我在报社工作，每周能挣六块钱，我总是直接拿回家给母亲。可从桌上那一摞钱里偷的几块我都花在了自己身上。你知道，都用来买了些小东西，糖、香烟什么的。”","“We got along pretty well.I studied to be a minister and prayed.I was a regular ass about saying prayers.You should have heard me.When my father died I prayed all night, just as I did sometimes when my brother was in town drinking and going about buying the things for us.In the evening after supper I knelt by the table where the money lay and prayed for hours.When no one was looking I stole a dollar or two and put it in my pocket.That makes me laugh now but then it was terrible.It was on my mind all the time.I got six dollars a week from my job on the paper and always took it straight home to mother.The few dollars I stole from my brother’s pile I spent on myself, you know, for trifles, candy and cigarettes and such things.”"
"“父亲在代顿的精神病院里过世的时候，我曾去过。我向我的老板借了一些钱，晚上乘火车去的。那时下着雨。在精神病院，他们款待我的样子就好像我是个国王。”","“When my father died at the asylum over at Dayton, I went over there.I borrowed some money from the man for whom I worked and went on the train at night.It was raining.In the asylum they treated me as though I were a king.”"
"“在那家精神病院工作的人发现我是个报社记者。这让他们很害怕。要知道，当我父亲病重的时候，他们有些疏忽大意。他们觉得我可能会小题大作地在报纸上报道一番。可我从没这么想过。”","“The men who had jobs in the asylum had found out I was a newspaper reporter.That made them afraid.There had been some negligence, some carelessness, you see, when father was ill.They thought perhaps I would write it up in the paper and make a fuss.I never intended to do anything of the kind.”"
"“总之，我走进父亲停灵的房间，对着他的尸体开始祷告。我弄不清为什么我会那么做。即便这样，我那当油漆工的兄弟也不会笑话我。我站在尸体身旁，伸出双手。精神病院的院长和他的助手们走了进来，站在旁边，看着很窘迫。那场面很滑稽。我伸出双手说道：‘愿这具畜体安息。’我就是这么说的。”他一下站了起来，中断了讲述，开始在报社的办公室里来回地踱步，乔治·威拉德就坐在那里听着。他动作笨拙，办公室很小，所以总磕磕碰碰。“我说这些真像个傻瓜。”他说，“我来这儿可不是因为想强迫你同我交朋友。我有别的打算。你是个记者，我曾经也是。所以，你引起了我的注意。你有可能最后也变成另一个像我一样的傻瓜。我想给你提个醒，并一直想给你敲敲警钟。我就是为这个找你的。”","Anyway, in I went to the room where my father lay dead and blessed the dead body.I wonder what put that notion into my head.Wouldn’t my brother, the painter, have laughed, though.There I stood over the dead body and spread out my hands.The superintendent of the asylum and some of his helpers came in and stood about looking sheepish.It was very amusing.I spread out my hands and said, ‘Let peace brood over this carcass.’ That’s what I said.”Jumping to his feet and breaking off the tale, Doctor Parcival began to walk up and down in the office of the Winesburg Eagle where George Willard sat listening.He was awkward and, as the office was small, continually knocked against things.“What a fool I am to be talking,” he said.“That is not my object in coming here and forcing my acquaintanceship upon you.I have something else in mind.You are a reporter just as I was once and you have attracted my attention.You may end by becoming just such another fool.I want to warn you and keep on warning you.That’s why I seek you out.”"
"于是，帕斯瓦尔医生开始和乔治谈起了处世之道。可在乔治看来，他只有一个目的——让人人都看起来卑鄙。“我想让你充满憎恨和藐视，这样，你才能成为人上人。”他郑重地说，“你看我的兄弟，他就是个例子，不是吗？要知道，他谁也瞧不起。你压根儿想不到他有多瞧不起我和母亲。他难道不比我们强吗？你知道的，他确实如此。你没见过他，可我已经让你感觉到了。我已经让你有了这种感觉。他死了。有一次他喝醉了，躺在铁轨上。他同其他油漆工住的那节车厢从他身上碾了过去。”","Doctor Parcival began talking of George Willard’s attitude toward men.It seemed to the boy that the man had but one object in view, to make everyone seem despicable.“I want to fill you with hatred and contempt so that you will be a superior being,” he declared.“Look at my brother.There was a fellow, eh?He despised everyone, you see.You have no idea with what contempt he looked upon mother and me.And was he not our superior?You know he was.You have not seen him and yet I have made you feel that.I have given you a sense of it.He is dead.Once when he was drunk he lay down on the tracks and the car in which he lived with the other painters ran over him.”"
"八月的一天，帕斯瓦尔医生在温斯堡有过一次难忘的经历。那个月，乔治每天早上都会到医生的办公室呆上一个小时。因为医生想给乔治读读他在写的一本书。医生声称，他正是为了写这本书才住到温斯堡来的。","One day in August Doctor Parcival had an adventure in Winesburg.For a month George Willard had been going each morning to spend an hour in the doctor’s office.The visits came about through a desire on the part of the doctor to read to the boy from the pages of a book he was in the process of writing.To write the book Doctor Parcival declared was the object of his coming to Winesburg to live."
"八月的一个早上，乔治还没来。医生的诊室里发生了一个小插曲。大街上发生了一起事故。一群马被火车惊了，跑掉了。一个农夫的女儿——一个小姑娘，从马车上被甩下来，摔死了。","On the morning in August before the coming of the boy, an incident had happened in the doctor’s office.There had been an accident on Main Street.A team of horses had been frightened by a train and had run away.A little girl, the daughter of a farmer, had been thrown from a buggy and killed."
"大街上的人都惊动了，都叫着要找医生来。镇上三位积极的医生迅速赶了过去，却发现孩子已经死了。人群里有人跑到帕斯瓦尔医生的办公室，但医生却断然拒绝去救那个死去的孩子。当事人并没有注意到他的冷酷拒绝。事实上，奔上楼来叫他的人，没听见他拒绝就匆匆忙忙地走掉了。","On Main Street everyone had become excited and a cry for doctors had gone up.All three of the active practitioners of the town had come quickly but had found the child dead.From the crowd someone had run to the office of Doctor Parcival who had bluntly refused to go down out of his office to the dead child.The useless cruelty of his refusal had passed unnoticed.Indeed, the man who had come up the stairway to summon him had hurried away without hearing the refusal."
"帕斯瓦尔医生显然对此也一无所知。乔治·威拉德走进他的办公室的时候，发现医生害怕得浑身发抖。“我的所作所为肯定会激起公愤的。”他大声喊起来，“我还不了解人类的本性吗？我还不知道会发生些什么吗？人们肯定会私下传播我拒绝的消息。不久，他们就会聚集起来，议论纷纷。他们会到这儿来。我们会争论一番，然后提到绞刑。接着，再来时，他们就会手里拿着根绳子。”","All of this, Doctor Parcival did not know and when George Willard came to his office he found the man shaking with terror.“What I have done will arouse the people of this town,” he declared excitedly.“Do I not know human nature?Do I not know what will happen?Word of my refusal will be whispered about.Presently men will get together in groups and talk of it.They will come here.We will quarrel and there will be talk of hanging.Then they will come again bearing a rope in their hands.”"
"医生害怕得一直抖。“我有预感，”他郑重其事地宣布，“我刚才说的一切估计不会在今天早上发生。可最迟拖到晚上，我就会被吊死。他们会群情激愤。我将会被吊死在大街的灯柱上。”","Doctor Parcival shook with fright.“I have a presentiment,” he declared emphatically.“It may be that what I am talking about will not occur this morning.It may be put off until tonight but I will be hanged.Everyone will get excited.I will be hanged to a lamp post on Main Street.”"
"他走到他那脏兮兮的办公室的门边，畏畏缩缩地看着通往街道的楼梯。等他转回身来的时候，眼里的恐惧开始变成了怀疑。他轻手轻脚地穿过房间走过来，拍了拍乔治的肩膀。“如果不是现在，有朝一日也会，”他低声地说道，摇摇头，“最后，我也会被钉死的，毫无意义地钉死。”","Going to the door of his dirty office, Doctor Parcival looked timidly down the stairway leading to the street.When he returned the fright that had been in his eyes was beginning to be replaced by doubt.Coming on tiptoe across the room he tapped George Willard on the shoulder.“If not now, sometime,” he whispered, shaking his head.“In the end I will be crucified, uselessly crucified.”"
"医生又开始恳求乔治。“你必须对我留点心。”他催促道，“如果有事发生，或许你能把我没写完的书完成。这本书的主题很简单，简单到稍不留心就会忘记。那就是——世上人人都是基督，都被钉在十字架上。这就是我想说的。你千万别忘了。无论发生什么，你千万别忘记。”","Doctor Parcival began to plead with George Willard.“You must pay attention to me,” he urged.“If something happens perhaps you will be able to write the book that I may never get written.The idea is very simple, so simple that if you are not careful you will forget it.It is this—that everyone in the world is Christ and they are all crucified.That’s what I want to say.Don’t you forget that.Whatever happens, don’t you dare let yourself forget.”"

"乔治·威拉德先四处小心地望了望，然后从《温斯堡鹰报》办公室的书桌后站起身，急急忙忙地从后门出去了。这是个温暖而阴沉的夜晚，尽管不到八点，《鹰报》办公楼后的小巷内已经一片漆黑。黑暗中，一群马被拴在一根柱子上，踢着腿，蹬在烤得发硬的地面上。一只猫从乔治·威拉德脚下跳了过去，消失在黑夜里。年轻人有些紧张。一整天，他都像个被打昏了的人似的忙着工作。在巷子里，他就好像是被惊吓了似的颤抖着。","Looking cautiously about, George Willard arose from his desk in the office of the Winesburg Eagle and went hurriedly out at the back door.The night was warm and cloudy and although it was not yet eight o’clock, the alleyway back of the Eagle office was pitch dark.A team of horses tied to a post somewhere in the darkness stamped on the hard-baked ground.A cat sprang from under George Willard’s feet and ran away into the night.The young man was nervous.All day he had gone about his work like one dazed by a blow.In the alleyway he trembled as though with fright."
"乔治·威拉德在黑暗里小心翼翼地沿着小巷走着。温斯堡各个商店的后门都开着，他可以看见人们在店里的灯下闲坐着。在梅尔波姆杂货店里，酒吧店的老板娘威利太太站在柜台边，胳膊上挽着一个篮子。店员锡德·格林陪在她旁边。他斜靠在柜台上面，郑重其事地说着话。","In the darkness George Willard walked along the alleyway, going carefully and cautiously.The back doors of the Winesburg stores were open and he could see men sitting about under the store lamps.In Myerbaum’s Notion Store Mrs.Willy the saloon keeper’s wife stood by the counter with a basket on her arm.Sid Green the clerk was waiting on her.He leaned over the counter and talked earnestly."
"乔治·威拉德蹲下身子，随即一跃，跳过了从门口照出来的一片亮光。他开始在黑暗里向前奔跑。在埃德·格里菲思酒吧店的后面，老酒鬼杰里·伯德躺在地上睡着了。乔治绊在他伸出来的腿上。他笑得喘不过气。","George Willard crouched and then jumped through the path of light that came out at the door.He began to run forward in the darkness.Behind Ed Griffith’s saloon old Jerry Bird the town drunkard lay asleep on the ground.The runner stumbled over the sprawling legs.He laughed brokenly."
"乔治·威拉德在做件冒险的事。这一整天，他都在竭力下定决心要将这件事做到底。现在，他就在付诸实践。在《鹰报》的办公室里，他从六点钟开始就一直坐着，努力思考着。","George Willard had set forth upon an adventure.All day he had been trying to make up his mind to go through with the adventure and now he was acting.In the office of the Winesburg Eagle he had been sitting since six o’clock trying to think."
"他并没有做出什么决定。他于是跳起来，匆忙越过在印刷室里校样的威尔·亨德森，开始沿着小巷奔跑起来。","There had been no decision.He had just jumped to his feet, hurried past Will Henderson who was reading proof in the printshop and started to run along the alleyway."
"乔治·威拉德跑过一条又一条街道，躲过沿路的行人。他穿过马路，再穿回来。当穿过一盏街灯的时候，他把帽子拉下来盖住脸。他不敢想。他心里有种恐惧，可这是种新的恐惧。他害怕正在进行的这个冒险被破坏，那他将会失去勇气，无功而返。","Through street after street went George Willard, avoiding the people who passed.He crossed and recrossed the road.When he passed a street lamp he pulled his hat down over his face.He did not dare think.In his mind there was a fear but it was a new kind of fear.He was afraid the adventure on which he had set out would be spoiled, that he would lose courage and turn back."
"乔治·威拉德看见路易丝·特鲁宁在她父亲的厨房里。她在一盏煤油灯下洗着盘子。厨房在房子的后面，像个小棚屋似的。她就站在纱门后面。乔治·威拉德停在一道尖尖的篱笆旁，竭力控制他颤抖的身体。隔开他同这次冒险行为的只有一片窄小的土豆地。五分钟后，他才觉得有足够的信心开口叫她。“路易丝！哦，路易丝！”他叫道。叫声卡在了他的喉咙里。他的声音变成了嘶哑的低语。","George Willard found Louise Trunnion in the kitchen of her father’s house.She was washing dishes by the light of a kerosene lamp.There she stood behind the screen door in the little shedlike kitchen at the back of the house.George Willard stopped by a picket fence and tried to control the shaking of his body.Only a narrow potato patch separated him from the adventure.Five minutes passed before he felt sure enough of himself to call to her.“Louise!Oh, Louise!” he called.The cry stuck in his throat.His voice became a hoarse whisper."
"路易丝·特鲁宁穿过那片土豆地走出来，手里还拿着洗碗布。“你怎么知道我想同你一起出去？”她闷闷不乐地说，“你凭什么这么自信？”","Louise Trunnion came out across the potato patch holding the dish cloth in her hand.“How do you know I want to go out with you,” she said sulkily.“What makes you so sure?”"
"乔治·威拉德没有答话。两个人隔着篱笆默默地站在黑暗里。","George Willard did not answer.In silence the two stood in the darkness with the fence between them."
"“你先走吧。”她说，“我爸爸在那儿，我就来。你在威廉斯的谷仓旁等我。”","“You go on along,” she said.“Pa’s in there.I’ll come along.You wait by Williams’ barn.”"
"年轻的记者收到过路易丝·特鲁宁的一封信。信是早上送到《鹰报》办公室的。内容很简洁。上面写的是：“如果你愿意，我就是你的。”可是，刚才在黑漆漆的篱笆边上她装作两人之间毫无关系的样子让他觉得气恼。“她真放肆！嘿，老天，她真放肆！”他低声嘟囔着，顺着街道走过一排种着玉米的空地。玉米长到人的肩膀那么高，一直种到了人行道上。路易丝从家里的前门出来，仍旧穿着洗碗时的格子布裙。她没有戴帽子。乔治看见她握着门把站在那里，同门里的人说话，毫无疑问，是同她的父亲，老杰克·特鲁宁。老杰克有些耳聋，她大声地嚷着。门关上了，小巷里一片漆黑寂静。乔治·威拉德比以往抖得更厉害了。","The young newspaper reporter had received a letter from Louise Trunnion.It had come that morning to the office of the Winesburg Eagle.The letter was brief.“I’m yours if you want me,” it said.He thought it annoying that in the darkness by the fence she had pretended there was nothing between them.“She has a nerve!Well, gracious sakes, she has a nerve,” he muttered as he went along the street and passed a row of vacant lots where corn grew.The corn was shoulder high and had been planted right down to the sidewalk.When Louise Trunnion came out of the front door of her house she still wore the gingham dress in which she had been washing dishes.There was no hat on her head.The boy could see her standing with the doorknob in her hand talking to someone within, no doubt to old Jake Trunnion, her father.Old Jake was half deaf and she shouted.The door closed and everything was dark and silent in the little side street.George Willard trembled more violently than ever."
"乔治和路易丝站在谷仓旁的阴影里，谁也不敢开口。她并不是很漂亮，鼻子旁还有块黒印。乔治想，她一定是在拿过厨房的锅后拿手指檫过鼻子。","In the shadows by Williams’ barn George and Louise stood, not daring to talk.She was not particularly comely and there was a black smudge on the side of her nose.George thought she must have rubbed her nose with her finger after she had been handling some of the kitchen pots."
"这个年轻人开始神经质地大笑起来。“天气很暖和啊，”他说。他想用手碰碰她。“我不要太冒失。”他想。他打定主意，就去摸摸她那条弄脏了的格子棉裙的花边，那应该也很美妙。她开始找茬了。“你觉得你比我强。别告诉我，我想我知道。”她说着，向他靠近了些。","The young man began to laugh nervously.“It’s warm,” he said.He wanted to touch her with his hand.“I’m not very bold,” he thought.Just to touch the folds of the soiled gingham dress would, he decided, be an exquisite pleasure.She began to quibble.“You think you’re better than I am.Don’t tell me, I guess I know,” she said drawing closer to him."
"乔治·威拉德突然滔滔不绝地开始说话了。他记起在街上遇见的时候，这姑娘的眼睛里曾隐藏着的神情，然后他想起她写的那封信。他不再怀疑了。小镇里流传的那些关于她的事情给了他信心。他变得雄性十足，放肆大胆、勇往直前。在他的内心，他并不同情她。“啊，过来，没关系的。没人会知道。他们怎么可能知道呢？”他怂恿道。","A flood of words burst from George Willard.He remembered the look that had lurked in the girl’s eyes when they had met on the streets and thought of the note she had written.Doubt left him.The whispered tales concerning her that had gone about town gave him confidence.He became wholly the male, bold and aggressive.In his heart there was no sympathy for her.“Ah, come on, it’ll be all right.There won’t be anyone know anything.How can they know?” he urged."
"他们开始沿着一条狭窄的砖块铺成的人行道往前走；砖头缝里长着长长的杂草。有的地方砖头都没了，路面凹凸不平。他握住她的手。那只手也十分粗糙，可他觉得小得可爱。“我不能走远。”她说，声音安静而镇定。","They began to walk along a narrow brick sidewalk between the cracks of which tall weeds grew.Some of the bricks were missing and the sidewalk was rough and irregular.He took hold of her hand that was also rough and thought it delightfully small.“I can’t go far,” she said and her voice was quiet, unperturbed."
"他们穿过一座小溪上的桥，然后经过了另一片长着玉米的空地。到了街道的尽头。在马路旁的小道上，他们只能一前一后地走。威尔·奥佛顿的浆果地就在马路边，那里有堆木板。“威尔打算在这里搭个棚子来放浆果箱。”乔治说，然后他们就在木板上坐了下来。","They crossed a bridge that ran over a tiny stream and passed another vacant lot in which corn grew.The street ended.In the path at the side of the road they were compelled to walk one behind the other.Will Overton’s berry field lay beside the road and there was a pile of boards.“Will is going to build a shed to store berry crates here,” said George and they sat down upon the boards."
"当乔治·威拉德回到大街上的时候，已经十点多了，而且开始下雨了。他在大街上来回走了整整三趟。西尔维斯特·韦斯特的杂货店还在营业，他进去买了支雪茄。店员肖提·克兰德尔送他出门的时候，他心情愉快。两个人站在店门的避雨蓬下聊了五分钟。乔治·威拉德感到心满意足。他特别想找个人聊聊。他轻轻地吹着口哨，往街转角的新威拉德旅店走去。","When George Willard got back into Main Street it was past ten o’clock and had begun to rain.Three times he walked up and down the length of Main Street.Sylvester West’s Drug Store was still open and he went in and bought a cigar.When Shorty Crandall the clerk came out at the door with him he was pleased.For five minutes the two stood in the shelter of the store awning and talked.George Willard felt satisfied.He had wanted more than anything else to talk to some man.Around a corner toward the New Willard House he went whistling softly."
"他停在温尼的干货店旁的人行道上，那里有一块高高的木栅栏，上面贴满了马戏团的照片。他一动不动地站在黑暗中，停止了吹口哨，开始聚精会神地聆听，就好像有个声音在叫他的名字似的。接着，他又神经兮兮地笑起来。“她什么也没从我这儿得到。没人知道。”他固执地喃喃自语，然后继续走他的路。","On the sidewalk at the side of Winney’s Dry Goods Store where there was a high board fence covered with circus pictures, he stopped whistling and stood perfectly still in the darkness, attentive, listening as though for a voice calling his name.Then again he laughed nervously.“She hasn’t got anything on me.Nobody knows,” he muttered doggedly and went on his way."
"第六章 虔诚","Chapter 6 Godliness"
"一个由四部分组成的故事","A Tale in Four Parts"
"一","I"
"本特利农场里总有三四位老人，或坐在房前的门廊里，或在花园里散步。其中的三位老太太是女的，是杰西的姐姐。她们面容苍白,说起话来轻声细语。还有一位是杰西的叔叔，有一头稀少的白发，总是缄默不语的。","There were always three or four old people sitting on the front porch of the house or puttering about the garden of the Bentley farm.Three of the old people were women and sisters to Jesse.They were a colorless, soft voiced lot.Then there was a silent old man with thin white hair who was Jesse’s uncle."
"这座农舍用木头建成，是一大块向外伸着的木板盖在木头架子上。事实上，这不是一座房子，而是好几座，不过以相当无序的方式连在一起了。房子里面处处令人吃惊。从起居室到餐厅要上台阶，从一个房间走到另一个也要上下台阶。吃饭的时候，这个地方就像个马蜂窝。开始时，一切都很安静；接着，门纷纷被打开，杂乱的脚步声在台阶上响起；然后，听到轻声的喃喃自语，这些人便从各个不起眼的角落里冒了出来。","The farmhouse was built of wood, a board outer-covering over a framework of logs.It was in reality not one house but a cluster of houses joined together in a rather haphazard manner.Inside, the place was full of surprises.One went up steps from the living room into the dining room and there were always steps to be ascended or descended in passing from one room to another.At meal times the place was like a beehive.At one moment all was quiet, then doors began to open, feet clattered on stairs, a murmur of soft voices arose and people appeared from a dozen obscure corners."
"除了之前提及的四位老人，农场里还住着许多人。这里有四个男仆；有管理家务的考利·毕比大妈；负责铺床和挤牛奶的傻丫头伊莱扎·斯托顿；收拾马厩的一个小伙子；还有杰西·本特利本人，他是这里的主人，主宰一切。","Besides the old people, already mentioned, many others lived in the Bentley house.There were four hired men, a woman named Aunt Callie Beebe, who was in charge of the housekeeping, a dull-witted girl named Eliza Stoughton, who made beds and helped with the milking, a boy who worked in the stables, and Jesse Bentley himself, the owner and overlord of it all."
"那时，美国内战已过去二十年了，本特利农场所在的俄亥俄北部地区已经开始从拓荒生活中崛起。杰西当时已经拥有了收割稻谷的机器。他已经建起了新式的谷仓，还用仔细铺设的排水瓦管给大多数土地排了水。但为了弄明白这个人，我们还得从更早的时候说起。","By the time the American Civil War had been over for twenty years, that part of Northern Ohio where the Bentley farms lay had begun to emerge from pioneer life.Jesse then owned machinery for harvesting grain.He had built modern barns and most of his land was drained with carefully laid tile drain, but in order to understand the man we will have to go back to an earlier day."
"在杰西这一辈之前，本特利家族已经有好几代人在俄亥俄北部居住了。他们来自纽约州；当时这片土地还未经开垦，所以可以以低价买到，于是他们便买下了地，在这里扎根下来。在很长的一段时间内，他们同中西部的其他美国人一样，非常贫穷。他们定居的土地上森林繁茂，满是倒下来的原木和矮树丛。他们付出了长期而艰苦的劳动来清理这些东西、砍伐木材。但现在他们还有残留的树桩需要清理。耕地时，犁常会碰上埋在地下的树根和遍地都是的石头；低洼的地方有积水；刚长出来的玉米就变黄、枯萎，最后死掉了。","The Bentley family had been in Northern Ohio for several generations before Jesse’s time.They came from New York State and took up land when the country was new and land could be had at a low price.For a long time they, in common with all the other Middle Western people, were very poor.The land they had settled upon was heavily wooded and covered with fallen logs and underbrush.After the long hard labor of clearing these away and cutting the timber, there were still the stumps to be reckoned with.Plows run through the fields caught on hidden roots, stones lay all about, on the low places water gathered, and the young corn turned yellow, sickened and died."
"等到杰西的父亲和兄弟们接手这片土地时，大部分艰苦的清理工作已经完成。可是，他们仍旧坚持旧式的农作方式，像牲口似的劳作。他们几乎和当时所有的庄稼汉们一样生活着。在春天和大部分冬天，通往温斯堡镇的大路都是一片泥泞。家里的四个年轻男人整天都在地里拼命干活，吃大量粗糙、油腻的食物，晚上睡在稻草床上，像累坏了的野兽一般。他们的生活中很少有不粗俗、不野蛮的人；表面上看，他们自己也是粗鄙、鲁莽的。每到周六下午，他们就赶着马，驾着一辆三人座的马车往小镇上去。在那里，他们会围在商店的火炉边上，同别的农夫或者店主们交谈。他们穿着套头衣，冬天时就穿着厚厚的、满是泥点的外套。他们在烤火时伸出来的手是干裂发红的。他们不善交谈，于是大多时候保持缄默。当他们买了肉、面粉、糖和盐之后，便会找间温斯堡的酒吧去喝啤酒。在酒精的作用下，平时被开垦新疆土的英雄劳动所压抑的、天生的强烈欲望便被释放了出来。他们被一种原始的、类似动物般的、充满诗意的热情所控制。回家途中，他们站在马车座位上，对着星星大叫大嚷。有时他们会长时间凶狠地斗殴，有时则会放声高歌。有一次，老大伊诺克·本特利用一个马车夫的马鞭鞭柄抽了他的父亲老汤姆·本特利一顿，老头看上去都要断气了。有好多天，艾诺克都藏在马厩阁楼的稻草堆里。一旦他那一时冲动的结果变成谋杀，他便准备偷偷逃走。他靠母亲带来的食物维系生命，她也将老头的伤情告诉他。情况一好转，他就从藏身之处冒了出来，像什么都没发生过一样回去开垦土地。","When Jesse Bentley’s father and brothers had come into their ownership of the place, much of the harder part of the work of clearing had been done, but they clung to old traditions and worked like driven animals.They lived as practically all of the farming people of the time lived.In the spring and through most of the winter the highways leading into the town of Winesburg were a sea of mud.The four young men of the family worked hard all day in the fields, they ate heavily of coarse, greasy food, and at night slept like tired beasts on beds of straw.Into their lives came little that was not coarse and brutal and outwardly they were themselves coarse and brutal.On Saturday afternoons they hitched a team of horses to a three-seated wagon and went off to town.In town they stood about the stoves in the stores talking to other farmers or to the store keepers.They were dressed in overalls and in the winter wore heavy coats that were flecked with mud.Their hands as they stretched them out to the heat of the stoves were cracked and red.It was difficult for them to talk and so they for the most part kept silent.When they had bought meat, flour, sugar, and salt, they went into one of the Winesburg saloons and drank beer.Under the influence of drink the naturally strong lusts of their natures, kept suppressed by the heroic labor of breaking up new ground, were released.A kind of crude and animal-like poetic fervor took possession of them.On the road home they stood up on the wagon seats and shouted at the stars.Sometimes they fought long and bitterly and at other times they broke forth into songs.Once Enoch Bentley, the older one of the boys, struck his father, old Tom Bentley, with the butt of a teamster’s whip, and the old man seemed likely to die.For days Enoch lay hid in the straw in the loft of the stable ready to flee if the result of his momentary passion turned out to be murder.He was kept alive with food brought by his mother, who also kept him informed of the injured man’s condition.When all turned out well he emerged from his hiding place and went back to the work of clearing land as though nothing had happened."
"内战迅速地改变了本特利家族的命运，也成就了最小的儿子杰西。伊诺克·本特利、爱德华·本特利、哈里·本特利和威尔·本特利全都报名参了军；在漫长的战争结束之前，他们全死在了战场上。他们离家前往南方打仗之后，老汤姆曾试着独自耕作，却没能成功。当最后一个儿子也死在战场上时，他给杰西捎信，要他无论如何必须回家。","The Civil War brought a sharp turn to the fortunes of the Bentleys and was responsible for the rise of the youngest son, Jesse.Enoch, Edward, Harry, and Will Bentley all enlisted and before the long war ended they were all killed.For a time after they went away to the South, old Tom tried to run the place, but he was not successful.When the last of the four had been killed he sent word to Jesse that he would have to come home."
"接着，病了一年的母亲突然去世，父亲便完全意志消沉了。他谈到想卖掉农场，搬到镇上去。他整天四处游荡，摇着脑袋喃喃自语。田地被荒废，玉米地里杂草丛生。老汤姆雇来工人却不善管理。工人们早上到田里干活的时候，他便在树林里盘桓，坐在一根木头上。有时候他晚上也忘了回家，女儿不得不四处寻找。","Then the mother, who had not been well for a year, died suddenly, and the father became altogether discouraged.He talked of selling the farm and moving into town.All day he went about shaking his head and muttering.The work in the fields was neglected and weeds grew high in the corn.Old Tim hired men but he did not use them intelligently.When they had gone away to the fields in the morning he wandered into the woods and sat down on a log.Sometimes he forgot to come home at night and one of the daughters had to go in search of him."
"杰西·本特利回到农场的家里开始接管一切的时候，已经是个二十二岁的成年男子了，看上去瘦弱而敏感。他十八岁时离家去上学，想成为一名学者，最后做一名长老会的神父。整个少年时期，他就是那种农村里称为“乖僻的羊”的人；他同几个哥哥的关系也不好。家里只有母亲理解他，但她现在也过世了。他回家接管的农场在那时已经扩大到了超过六百英亩。见他没法去接手过去由四个身强力壮的哥哥干的活，附近农场和温斯堡镇郊的所有人都嘲笑他。","When Jesse Bentley came home to the farm and began to take charge of things he was a slight, sensitive-looking man of twenty-two.At eighteen he had left home to go to school to become a scholar and eventually to become a minister of the Presbyterian Church.All through his boyhood he had been what in our country was called an “odd sheep” and had not got on with his brothers.Of all the family only his mother had understood him and she was now dead.When he came home to take charge of the farm, that had at that time grown to more than six hundred acres, everyone on the farms about and in the nearby town of Winesburg smiled at the idea of his trying to handle the work that had been done by his four strong brothers."
"事实上，他们也有足够的理由笑话他。按照当时的标准，杰西看上去完全不像个男人。他瘦小纤细，身材像个女人；着装严格按照年轻牧师的传统穿戴：一件黑色长外套，系了个窄窄的黑色蝶形领结。每次邻居们看见他都忍俊不禁。多年以后，当他们看见他娶的城里的妻子时更是乐不可支。","There was indeed good cause to smile.By the standards of his day Jesse did not look like a man at all.He was small and very slender and womanish of body and, true to the traditions of young ministers, wore a long black coat and a narrow black string tie.The neighbors were amused when they saw him, after the years away, and they were even more amused when they saw the woman he had married in the city."
"事实上，他的妻子不久便死了。那或许都是杰西的错。在战后的艰难时世里，一个北俄亥俄州的农场并不适合雅致的女性；可凯瑟琳·本特利正是一位雅致的女人。杰西待她十分严厉，如同他那时待身边的每个人一样。她努力像周围所有的女人那样去干活，他也任她去，不加干涉。她帮着挤牛奶，做一部分家务，还给男人们铺床煮饭。她就这样每天从早到晚地操劳了一年，刚生完一个孩子就死了。","As a matter of fact, Jesse’s wife did soon go under.That was perhaps Jesse’s fault.A farm in Northern Ohio in the hard years after the Civil War was no place for a delicate woman, and Katherine Bentley was delicate.Jesse was hard with her as he was with everybody about him in those days.She tried to do such work as all the neighbor women about her did and he let her go on without interference.She helped to do the milking and did part of the housework; she made the beds for the men and prepared their food.For a year she worked every day from sunrise until late at night and then after giving birth to a child she died."
"至于杰西·本特利本人——虽然他体格柔弱，可他体内仍有些东西不会被轻易抹杀。他有着一头棕色的卷发和一双灰色的眼睛。有时眼神冷酷而犀利，有时游移不定。他不但长得瘦，而且个头较矮。他的嘴很像一个敏感而非常固执的孩子的嘴。杰西·本特利是个狂热分子。他生来同这个时代和地方格格不入，因此，他备受煎熬，也折磨着别人。他从未成功地从生活里得到他想要的东西，而他也不知道他想要什么。在他回到本特利农场的一段非常短的时间内，农场里的人都有些怕他。他的妻子本应当像他母亲那样同他亲近，却也一样怕他。他回家两周后，老汤姆·本特利就将这个地方的全部所有权移交给了他，自己则退隐到幕后。人人都退隐到了幕后。尽管杰西年轻、缺乏经验，可他自有方法降伏他的手下。他对自己的所言所行极为较真，以至于没人能理解。他使农场里的人空前地忙碌，然而工作毫无乐趣。如果事情进展顺利，那也只对杰西有利，而对那些赖他生存的人而言则毫无益处。就像其他后期来到美国的成千上万的强者一样，杰西仅仅是外强中干而已。他能掌控别人，却无法控制自己。管理这个从未被管理过的农场于他是一件易事。他一从就学的克利夫兰回到家，就不与他的所有手下接触，而是自己着手制定计划。他夜以继日地对农场进行筹谋，并取得了成功。他周边其他农场的人都在过于辛苦地工作，过于激情似火，而无暇思考，可对杰西而言，考虑农场，并为使农场经营成功而不断制定计划却是一种放松。这部分地满足了他狂热天性中的某种东西。他一回家就紧挨着老屋搭建了一间偏房，里面有间朝西的大房间，一边的窗户能看到谷场，另一边的窗户能望到整个田野。他就坐在窗边思考。日复一日，他接连好几个小时坐在那里眺望这片土地，悟出了新的人生定位。天性中燃烧着的热情开始变成熊熊大火，他的眼神也变得坚定起来。他想让农场的产出达到州内其他的农场无法企及的目标，接下来，他还想要些别的什么。他内心的这种莫名的饥渴使他的眼神犹疑，在人前也愈发沉默。他本当多多付出以获得一种平静，但他心里担心这种平静是自己无法企及的。","As for Jesse Bentley—although he was a delicately built man there was something within him that could not easily be killed.He had brown curly hair and grey eyes that were at times hard and direct, at times wavering and uncertain.Not only was he slender but he was also short of stature.His mouth was like the mouth of a sensitive and very determined child.Jesse Bentley was a fanatic.He was a man born out of his time and place and for this he suffered and made others suffer.Never did he succeed in getting what he wanted out of life and he did not know what he wanted.Within a very short time after he came home to the Bentley farm he made everyone there a little afraid of him, and his wife, who should have been close to him as his mother had been, was afraid also.At the end of two weeks after his coming, old Tom Bentley made over to him the entire ownership of the place and retired into the background.Everyone retired into the background.In spite of his youth and inexperience, Jesse had the trick of mastering the souls of his people.He was so in earnest in everything he did and said that no one understood him.He made everyone on the farm work as they had never worked before and yet there was no joy in the work.If things went well they went well for Jesse and never for the people who were his dependents.Like a thousand other strong men who have come into the world here in America in these later times, Jesse was but half strong.He could master others but he could not master himself.The running of the farm as it had never been run before was easy for him.When he came home from Cleveland where he had been in school, he shut himself off from all of his people and began to make plans.He thought about the farm night and day and that made him successful.Other men on the farms about him worked too hard and were too fired to think, but to think of the farm and to be everlastingly making plans for its success was a relief to Jesse.It partially satisfied something in his passionate nature.Immediately after he came home he had a wing built on to the old house and in a large room facing the west he had windows that looked into the barnyard and other windows that looked off across the fields.By the window he sat down to think.Hour after hour and day after day he sat and looked over the land and thought out his new place in life.The passionate burning thing in his nature flamed up and his eyes became hard.He wanted to make the farm produce as no farm in his state had ever produced before and then he wanted something else.It was the indefinable hunger within that made his eyes waver and that kept him always more and more silent before people.He would have given much to achieve peace and in him was a fear that peace was the thing he could not achieve."
"杰西·本特利整个人都活力四射。在他矮小的骨架里聚集了一长排强者的合力。在农场还是个小男孩的时候，他的精力就格外充沛，后来青年时期在学校里也是如此。求学期间，他全心全意地研习和思考上帝与《圣经》。随着时光流逝，他逐渐对人类有了更深的认识，于是开始将自己看作是一个非比寻常的人，与他的同伴们截然不同。他特别想让自己的人生变得意义非凡。当他环顾四周，看到他人皆是碌碌无为，在他看来如同傻瓜一般时，他决不能容忍自己也成为一个傻瓜。他专心思考着自己及自己的命运，却忽略了一个事实——他年轻的妻子即使在怀孕之后仍在做着一个强壮农妇做的家事；她在为他付出，但也在自杀。尽管如此，他本无意如此虐待她。他的老父亲因长年辛劳而佝偻着身体，将农场之主的权力移交予他后便看似满意地隐身到角落里去，等待大限到来。而他则耸耸肩，随后便将这位老人置于脑后了。","All over his body Jesse Bentley was alive.In his small frame was gathered the force of a long line of strong men.He had always been extraordinarily alive when he was a small boy on the farm and later when he was a young man in school.In the school he had studied and thought of God and the Bible with his whole mind and heart.As time passed and he grew to know people better, he began to think of himself as an extraordinary man, one set apart from his fellows.He wanted terribly to make his life a thing of great importance, and as he looked about at his fellow men and saw how like clods they lived it seemed to him that he could not bear to become also such a clod.Although in his absorption in himself and in his own destiny he was blind to the fact that his young wife was doing a strong woman’s work even after she had become large with child and that she was killing herself in his service, he did not intend to be unkind to her.When his father, who was old and twisted with toil, made over to him the ownership of the farm and seemed content to creep away to a corner and wait for death, he shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the old man from his mind."
"杰西坐在房间的窗边，思考着自己的事情，透过窗户可看见传到他手里的这片土地。他能听到自己的马群在牲畜棚里踏步，牛也在不停地来回走动着。　远处，他能看到其他的牛在牧场的青山上转悠。为他干活的工人们的声音从窗户外传了进来。从挤奶房那儿传来一成不变的咚咚作响声，那是傻姑娘伊莉扎·斯托顿在摆弄搅乳器。杰西想到了《旧约》里的情形，那时的人也拥有土地和牲畜。他记得上帝是如何从天上来到凡间，并同人类交谈，他也希望上帝能看到他，并也来同他交谈。他多么希望能够在自己生命中以某种方式实现曾降临在那些人身上的荣光，这种狂热的、孩子气的迫切心情占据了他的身心。作为一个勤于祈祷的人，他将这番心事大声地说给上帝听，而他的祷告声同时也增强和满足了他的渴望。","In the room by the window overlooking the land that had come down to him sat Jesse thinking of his own affairs.In the stables he could hear the tramping of his horses and the restless movement of his cattle.Away in the fields he could see other cattle wandering over green hills.The voices of men, his men who worked for him, came in to him through the window.From the milkhouse there was the steady thump, thump of a churn being manipulated by the half-witted girl, Eliza Stoughton.Jesse’s mind went back to the men of Old Testament days who had also owned lands and herds.He remembered how God had come down out of the skies and talked to these men and he wanted God to notice and to talk to him also.A kind of feverish boyish eagerness to in some way achieve in his own life the flavor of significance that had hung over these men took possession of him.Being a prayerful man he spoke of the matter aloud to God and the sound of his own words strengthened and fed his eagerness."
"“我是继承这片土地的新新人类。”他大声说道，“请看看我，上帝啊，请您也看看我的四邻和我的先辈们！啊，上帝，请将我造成另一个杰西吧，像古代的杰西一样，统治众人，我的儿子们也注定成为统治者！”他在大声祷告的时候变得激动起来，于是跳起身，在房里走来走去。他幻想着自己置身于那个时代，置身于那些古人之中。那片在他眼前延伸开去的土地变得意义重大；在他的幻想里，那里住着一种由他繁衍而来的新新人类。在他看来，他所在的时代便如同那些其他的旧日光辉年代一般，通过一名上帝挑选的仆人来宣告上帝的力量。由此，新的王国将被创造，新的力量被注入人类的生活。他渴望成为上帝的那个仆人。“我正是来这里完成上帝指派的使命的。”他高声宣告道，瘦小的身体挺得绷直，他觉得好像自己头上悬着上帝所许的光环。","“I am a new kind of man come into possession of these fields,” he declared.“Look upon me, O God, and look Thou also upon my neighbors and all the men who have gone before me here!O God, create in me another Jesse, like that one of old, to rule over men and to be the father of sons who shall be rulers!”Jesse grew excited as he talked aloud and jumping to his feet walked up and down in the room.In fancy he saw himself living in old times and among old peoples.The land that lay stretched out before him became of vast significance, a place peopled by his fancy with a new race of men sprung from himself.It seemed to him that in his day as in those other and older days, kingdoms might be created and new impulses given to the lives of men by the power of God speaking through a chosen servant.He longed to be such a servant.“It is God’s work I have come to the land to do,” he declared in a loud voice and his short figure straightened and he thought that something like a halo of Godly approval hung over him."
"对后世的人而言，要理解杰西·本特利恐非易事。在刚过去的五十年里，人们的生活发生了巨大的变化。事实上，一场革命已经开始了。工业主义伴随着喧嚣和纷扰来到：我们中数以百万的海外移民发出尖锐的呼喊声；火车来往奔忙；城市兴起；在建的城间火车线穿过城镇、经过乡村；而近来发明的汽车也已使在美国中部生活的人们在生活及思维习惯上发生了巨大变化。书本——尽管在我们这个年代看来是仓促而就、缺乏想象与文采的——却已经成为居家必备；杂志的发行量超过百万，报纸更是遍地皆是。我们这个年代的农夫会站在村中小店的炉火边，脑袋里塞满了别人的语言，侃侃而谈。报纸和杂志已为这些人提供了诸多谈资。曾经的粗鄙无知，虽然有种孩子般的纯真美好，也已经永远消失了。炉火边的农夫同城里的人就如兄弟一般，如果听听他们说话，你会发现他同城里最棒的人一样，浅薄愚昧。","It will perhaps be somewhat difficult for the men and women of a later day to understand Jesse Bentley.In the last fifty years a vast change has taken place in the lives of our people.A revolution has in fact taken place.The coming of industrialism, attended by all the roar and rattle of affairs, the shrill cries of millions of new voices that have come among us from overseas, the going and coming of trains, the growth of cities, the building of the inter-urban car lines that weave in and out of towns and past farmhouses, and now in these later days the coming of the automobiles has worked a tremendous change in the lives and in the habits of thought of our people of Mid-America.Books, badly imagined and written though they may be in the hurry of our times, are in every household, magazines circulate by the millions of copies, newspapers are everywhere.In our day a farmer standing by the stove in the store in his village has his mind filled to over-flowing with the words of other men.The newspapers and the magazines have pumped him full.Much of the old brutal ignorance that had in it also a kind of beautiful childlike innocence is gone forever.The farmer by the stove is brother to the men of the cities, and if you listen you will find him talking as glibly and as senselessly as the best city man of us all."
"但是，在杰西所处的年代里，整个中西部的农村在内战后的多年里都远非如此。人们疲于劳作，根本没力气再去阅读。他们对于印在纸上的铅字压根没有兴趣。当他们在田间劳作的时候，脑海里是些模糊而未成形的思想。他们信仰上帝，并坚信借由上帝的力量来掌控自己的生活。周日，他们聚集在小型的新教教堂里聆听上帝及其功绩。这些教堂就是当时社会和精神生活的中心。上帝的形象在当时人们的心中是伟大的。","In Jesse Bentley’s time and in the country districts of the whole Middle West in the years after the Civil War it was not so.Men labored too hard and were too tired to read.In them was no desire for words printed upon paper.As they worked in the fields, vague, half-formed thoughts took possession of them.They believed in God and in God’s power to control their lives.In the little Protestant churches they gathered on Sunday to hear of God and his works.The churches were the center of the social and intellectual life of the times.The figure of God was big in the hearts of men."
"因此，作为一个生来就富于想象力和极具强大知识渴求的孩子，杰西·本特利全身心地投入了上帝的怀抱。当内战夺走了他几个哥哥的生命时，他看到了上帝的力量。当他的父亲病倒，再也不能管理农场的时候，他也将此看作是上帝的指示。当他在城市里接到消息的时候，他在夜里步行穿过街道，思索着这个问题；当他回到家并将农场事务安排得井井有条的时候，他又在夜里步行穿过树林，越过低矮的山坡，同时思考着上帝。","And so, having been born an imaginative child and having within him a great intellectual eagerness, Jesse Bentley had turned wholeheartedly toward God.When the war took his brothers away, he saw the hand of God in that.When his father became ill and could no longer attend to the running of the farm, he took that also as a sign from God.In the city, when the word came to him, he walked about at night through the streets thinking of the matter and when he had come home and had got the work on the farm well under way, he went again at night to walk through the forests and over the low hills and to think of God."
"当他这样步行的时候，自己在某种神圣计划中的重要性越发地浮现在他的脑海里。他因农场只有六百英亩而变得贪婪、缺乏耐心。在某个草地边，他跪倒在篱笆的转角处放声高喊，周围一片静寂。他抬头仰望星空，看到星光照耀洒落在自己身上。父亲去世几个月后，他的妻子凯瑟琳也在随时待产。一个夜晚，杰西离开自己的房子去远处散步。本特利农场坐落在瓦英河所灌溉的一个小山谷里，杰西沿着溪流的河岸一直走到自家土地的尽头，再接着走过邻居家的田地。他一路走来，山谷时而宽时而窄。广袤的田野延伸开去，树林也展现在眼前。月亮从云层里出来，他爬上一座小山坡，坐下来思考。","As he walked the importance of his own figure in some divine plan grew in his mind.He grew avaricious and was impatient that the farm contained only six hundred acres.Kneeling in a fence corner at the edge of some meadow, he sent his voice abroad into the silence and looking up he saw the stars shining down at him.One evening, some months after his father’s death, and when his wife Katherine was expecting at any moment to be laid abed of childbirth, Jesse left his house and went for a long walk.The Bentley farm was situated in a tiny valley watered by Wine Creek, and Jesse walked along the banks of the stream to the end of his own land and on through the fields of his neighbors.As he walked the valley broadened and then narrowed again.Great open stretches of field and wood lay before him.The moon came out from behind clouds, and, climbing a low hill, he sat down to think."
"杰西想，作为上帝忠实的仆人，他所走过的整个农田都应当归他所有。他想起几个死去的哥哥，不由得责怪他们没能更努力些劳动，获得更多的土地。眼前，月光下的小溪顺着石子潺潺流下，他开始想到旧时和他一样的伟人们，他们曾牛羊成群，良田千顷。","Jesse thought that as the true servant of God the entire stretch of country through which he had walked should have come into his possession.He thought of his dead brothers and blamed them that they had not worked harder and achieved more.Before him in the moonlight the tiny stream ran down over stones, and he began to think of the men of old times who like himself had owned flocks and lands."
"一种奇异的冲动——半是害怕，半是贪婪——占据了杰西·本特利的心。他记起在《圣经》故事中，上帝如何出现在那个杰西面前，告知他将儿子大卫派到以拉谷去，在那里，扫罗正联合以色列人同非利士人打仗。杰西的心中此时坚定了一个信念：所有俄亥俄州瓦英谷里拥有土地的农场主们都是非利士人，也就是上帝的敌人。“假设，”他低声自语道，“他们当中会有一个像歌利亚一样的迦特非利士人，能够击败我并夺走我的所有。”在幻想中，他感到了那种令人厌恶的恐惧，他认为这种情绪必然也在大卫到来之前重重压在扫罗的心头。他跳起来，开始在黑夜中奔跑。他一边跑，一边呼唤着上帝。他的声音传遍了低矮的山坡。“万能的主啊”，他叫道，“今夜，从凯瑟琳的子宫里赐给我一个儿子吧。请您赐福与我。赐给我一个叫大卫的儿子，帮我从非利士人手中最终夺得所有这些土地，并使他们臣服于您，为您在世上建立王国。”","A fantastic impulse, half fear, half greediness, took possession of Jesse Bentley.He remembered how in the old Bible story the Lord had appeared to that other Jesse and told him to send his son David to where Saul and the men of Israel were fighting the Philistines in the Valley of Elah.Into Jesse’s mind came the conviction that all of the Ohio farmers who owned land in the valley of Wine Creek were Philistines and enemies of God.“Suppose,” he whispered to himself, “there should come from among them one who, like Goliath the  Philistine of Gath, could defeat me and take from me my possessions.”In fancy he felt the sickening dread that he thought must have lain heavy on the heart of Saul before the coming of David.Jumping to his feet, he began to run through the night.As he ran he called to God.His voice carried far over the low hills.“Jehovah of Hosts,” he cried, “send to me this night out of the womb of Katherine, a son.Let Thy grace alight upon me.Send me a son to be called David who shall help me to pluck at last all of these lands out of the hands of the Philistines and turn them to Thy service and to the building of Thy kingdom on earth.”"
"二","II"
"俄亥俄州温斯堡的大卫·哈代是本特利农场主杰西·本特利的外孙。当他十二岁大的时候，便住到本特利老宅去了。他的母亲，路易丝·本特利，就是杰西当晚在田野里奔跑呼喊着上帝赐予儿子的时候降临人世的那个女儿。她在农场长大，嫁给了温斯堡镇年轻的后来成了银行家的约翰·哈代。路易丝同丈夫生活得并不幸福，大家一致认为责任在她。她是个瘦小的女人，有敏锐的灰眼睛和一头黑发。从儿时起，她便爱发脾气，不生气的时候，她也总是面容阴郁，沉默不语。温斯堡里传言她酗酒。她的银行家丈夫是个谨慎精明的人，竭尽全力来使她高兴。当他开始赚钱的时候，他便在温斯堡的埃尔姆大街上为她买了幢砖砌的大房子；他是镇上首位为妻子的马车雇佣男仆的人。","David Hardy of Winesburg, Ohio, was the grandson of Jesse Bentley, the owner of Bentley farms.When he was twelve years old he went to the old Bentley place to live.His mother, Louise Bentley, the girl who came into the world on that night when Jesse ran through the fields crying to God that he be given a son, had grown to womanhood on the farm and had married young John Hardy of Winesburg, who became a banker.Louise and her husband did not live happily together and everyone agreed that she was to blame.She was a small woman with sharp grey eyes and black hair.From childhood she had been inclined to fits of temper and when not angry she was often morose and silent.In Winesburg it was said that she drank.Her husband, the banker, who was a careful, shrewd man, tried hard to make her happy.When he began to make money he bought for her a large brick house on Elm Street in Winesburg and he was the first man in that town to keep a manservant to drive his wife’s carriage."
"可是，路易丝并不容易取悦。她很容易半癫狂地发脾气，有时沉默，有时狂躁、爱与人争吵。她生气时会咒骂和大声叫嚷。她还从厨房拿过刀，威胁要杀死丈夫。有一次，她故意在房里纵火；而且她经常躲在自己的房间里，好几天谁都不见。她过着半隐居的生活，各种关于她的故事甚嚣尘上。有传言说她吸毒，还说她受酗酒的影响很大，身体的状况往往无法掩饰，所以只得躲起来不见人。有时在夏日的下午，她会从房子里出来，登上马车。她将车夫赶开，自己抓着缰绳，飞一般地驶过街道。若是有行人挡道，她也照直冲过去，吓得那人不得不赶紧逃开。在镇上的人看来，她几乎是存心从他们身上碾过去的。她驶过几条街，疾转过几个弯，然后用鞭子抽打着马匹向乡村奔去。当驶上乡村的大道，再看不到镇上的房子的时候，她便让马慢下来，而她那狂野鲁莽的情绪总算过去了。她陷入了深思，开始喃喃自语。有时泪水会涌上她的眼眶。可当她返回镇上时，她又开始发疯般地在安静的街道上横冲直撞。要不是她丈夫的影响力，以及当地人对他心怀的敬意，她早被镇上的警长逮捕过不止一次了。","But Louise could not be made happy.She flew into half insane fits of temper during which she was sometimes silent, sometimes noisy and quarrelsome.She swore and cried out in her anger.She got a knife from the kitchen and threatened her husband’s life.Once she deliberately set fire to the house, and often she hid herself away for days in her own room and would see no one.Her life, lived as a half recluse, gave rise to all sorts of stories concerning her.It was said that she took drugs and that she hid herself away from people because she was often so under the influence of drink that her condition could not be concealed.Sometimes on summer afternoons she came out of the house and got into her carriage.Dismissing the driver she took the reins in her own hands and drove off at top speed through the streets.If a pedestrian got in her way she drove straight ahead and the frightened citizen had to escape as best he could.To the people of the town it seemed as though she wanted to run them down.When she had driven through several streets, tearing around corners and beating the horses with the whip, she drove off into the country.On the country roads after she had gotten out of sight of the houses she let the horses slow down to a walk and her wild, reckless mood passed.She became thoughtful and muttered words.Sometimes tears came into her eyes.And then when she came back into town she again drove furiously through the quiet streets.But for the influence of her husband and the respect he inspired in people’s minds she would have been arrested more than once by the town marshal."
"年轻的大卫·哈代跟着妈妈在这间房子里长大，可以想见，他的童年没有多少乐趣可言。那时的他太年幼，很难对人形成自己的观点。但对于这个是自己母亲的女人不持有非常肯定的观点，有时倒很难。大卫一直是个安静规矩的孩子，长久以来，温斯堡的人都认为他有些傻气。他的眼睛是棕色的，还是个孩子时他就养成了一种习惯：长时间地看着人或物，可看起来又好像什么也没看见。当他听见别人无情地谈及他的母亲或是无意听到母亲在叱骂父亲的时候，他就感到害怕，要找个地方躲起来。有时他找不到藏身之处，就会惊惶失措。于是，他将脸转向一棵树，如果在房内就转向墙，闭上双眼，竭力什么也不去想。他习惯高声自言自语；幼年时，一种寂静的哀伤时常占据心头。","Young David Hardy grew up in the house with this woman and as can well be imagined there was not much joy in his childhood.He was too young then to have opinions of his own about people, but at times it was difficult for him not to have very definite opinions about the woman who was his mother.David was always a quiet, orderly boy and for a long time was thought by the people of Winesburg to be something of a dullard.His eyes were brown and as a child he had a habit of looking at things and people a long time without appearing to see what he was looking at.When he heard his mother spoken of harshly or when he overheard her berating his father, he was frightened and ran away to hide.Sometimes he could not find a hiding place and that confused him.Turning his face toward a tree or if he was indoors toward the wall, he closed his eyes and tried not to think of anything.He had a habit of talking aloud to himself, and early in life a spirit of quiet sadness often took possession of him."
"每当他前往本特利农场看望外公的时候，他总感到意足和快乐。他常常希望可以永远不再回到镇上去。有一次，他在农场呆了很长一段时间后返回家中时，发生了一件事，并对他产生了深远的影响。","On the occasions when David went to visit his grandfather on the Bentley farm, he was altogether contented and happy.Often he wished that he would never have to go back to town and once when he had come home from the farm after a long visit, something happened that had a lasting effect on his mind."
"大卫同一个仆人返回镇上。那个仆人急于去忙自己的事情，就将他一个孩子扔在了哈代家房子所在的那条街的街头上。当时正值秋夜的傍晚时分，天空乌云密布。大卫变了主意。他无法忍受再回到父母住的那座房子里，冲动之下，他决定离家出走。他打算回农场和外公呆在一起，可迷了路。他在乡间的马路上哭泣着转悠了好几个小时，惊惶不安。天开始下雨，闪电划过天空。孩子的想象力被激发起来，他幻想着能够看到和听见黑暗中奇怪的东西。他心里坚信他正漫步、奔跑在前人未曾涉足过的某个恐怖虚幻空间里。笼罩在他四周的黑暗似乎无边无际。大风吹过树林的声响令人毛骨悚然。当一队人马沿着他所在的马路接近他的时候，他受到了惊吓，爬上了一道篱笆。他飞奔着越过田野，来到另一条马路上，然后双膝跪倒，用手指抚摸着身下松软的大地。要不是他外公的身影——他害怕他在黑暗中再也找不到他了——他认为这个世界必定是完全虚空的。一个从镇上步行回家的农夫听到了他的喊叫，将他送回了他父亲的家。他又累又兴奋，对于发生的事情茫然无知。","David had come back into town with one of the hired men.The man was in a hurry to go about his own affairs and left the boy at the head of the street in which the Hardy house stood.It was early dusk of a fall evening and the sky was overcast with clouds.Something happened to David.He could not bear to go into the house where his mother and father lived, and on an impulse he decided to run away from home.He intended to go back to the farm and to his grandfather, but lost his way and for hours he wandered weeping and frightened on country roads.It started to rain and lightning flashed in the sky.The boy’s imagination was excited and he fancied that he could see and hear strange things in the darkness.Into his mind came the conviction that he was walking and running in some terrible void where no one had ever been before.The darkness about him seemed limitless.The sound of the wind blowing in trees was terrifying.When a team of horses approached along the road in which he walked he was frightened and climbed a fence.Through a field he ran until he came into another road and getting upon his knees felt of the soft ground with his fingers.But for the figure of his grandfather, whom he was afraid he would never find in the darkness, he thought the world must be altogether empty.When his cries were heard by a farmer who was walking home from town and he was brought back to his father’s house, he was so tired and excited that he did not know what was happening to him."
"大卫的父亲偶然间知道了孩子失踪这件事。他在街上遇到了那个本特利农场来的仆人，得知儿子已经返回镇上了。孩子没有回到家时，约翰·哈代就马上警觉了起来。他同镇上的几个人前往乡村寻找。大卫被绑架的消息马上传遍了温斯堡的街头巷尾。当他回到家里时，房子里一片漆黑，只有他的母亲跑了出来，迫不及待地将他紧紧抱住。大卫觉得她突然变成了另一个女人。他不能相信竟然发生了这样的好事。路易丝·哈代亲自给疲倦的儿子洗澡，给他做饭吃。她甚至舍不得让他去睡觉。当他穿上睡袍，她便吹熄了灯，将他抱在怀里，坐在椅子上。这个女人在黑夜里搂着儿子坐了有一个钟头。她一直不停地低声说着话。大卫不明白是什么使她发生了如此变化。他认为，她那张习惯性布满怨怼的脸已变成了一张他所见过的最平和、最可爱的面庞。当他开始呜呜哭泣的时候，她便抱得更紧了。她不停地说着话。那声音与她平时同丈夫说话时的那种沙哑或者尖锐的嗓音不同，而像是落在树间的雨滴的声音。不一会儿，有些人开始到门口来汇报，说孩子还没有找到。可她却一声不吭地将孩子藏了起来，直到将来人都打发走。大卫想这一定是妈妈和镇上的人同他玩的一个游戏，于是他兴高采烈地大笑起来。他不由得觉得他的走失和在黑夜中受到的惊吓都不过是件完全无足轻重的事情。他觉得只要能在那条漫长黑暗的道路尽头确定看到一个如此可爱的妈妈突然出现，那么即使要他再经历这可怕的体验一千遍，他也愿意。","By chance David’s father knew that he had disappeared.On the street he had met the farm hand from the Bentley place and knew of his son’s return to town.When the boy did not come home an alarm was set up and John Hardy with several men of the town went to search the country.The report that David had been kidnapped ran about through the streets of Winesburg.When he came home there were no lights in the house, but his mother appeared and clutched him eagerly in her arms.David thought she had suddenly become another woman.He could not believe that so delightful a thing had happened.With her own hands Louise Hardy bathed his tired young body and cooked him food.She would not let him go to bed but, when he had put on his nightgown, blew out the lights and sat down in a chair to hold him in her arms.For an hour the woman sat in the darkness and held her boy.All the time she kept talking in a low voice.David could not understand what had so changed her.Her habitually dissatisfied face had become, he thought, the most peaceful and lovely thing he had ever seen.When he began to weep she held him more and more tightly.On and on went her voice.It was not harsh or shrill as when she talked to her husband, but was like rain falling on trees.Presently men began coming to the door to report that he had not been found, but she made him hide and be silent until she had sent them away.He thought it must be a game his mother and the men of the town were playing with him and laughed joyously.Into his mind came the thought that his having been lost and frightened in the darkness was an altogether unimportant matter.He thought that he would have been willing to go through the frightful experience a thousand times to be sure of finding at the end of the long black road a thing so lovely as his mother had suddenly become."
"在大卫儿童时期的最后几年里，他很少见到母亲。对他而言，她变成了一个仅仅只是和他生活过一段时间的女人。但他仍不能将她的影子从脑海里抹去，随着年岁渐长，这个影子愈发变得清晰了。他长到十二岁时便住到了本特利农场。老杰西来到镇上，严正要求他们将孩子交给他管。老人非常激动而且决意如此。他在约翰·哈代的温斯堡储蓄银行的办公室里同他进行了会谈，然后两个人便一起回到位于埃尔姆大街的房子去和路易丝商量。他们都以为她会阻挠，可事实并非如此。她非常平静。当杰西说明了此行的目的，详细解释了让孩子呆在户外和老式农场安静的环境里生活的好处之后，她就点头表示同意了。“那里的气氛不会因为有我而变糟。”她一针见血地说。她的双肩颤抖，看上去似乎马上就要发火了。“那地方适合男孩子，尽管永远不适合我。”她继续说，“您从来都不想让我去那儿，当然，您房子那儿的空气对我也没好处。它对我而言就像毒药，可对大卫来说就不同了。”","During the last years of young David’s boyhood he saw his mother but seldom and she became for him just a woman with whom he had once lived.Still he could not get her figure out of his mind and as he grew older it became more definite.When he was twelve years old he went to the Bentley farm to live.Old Jesse came into town and fairly demanded that he be given charge of the boy.The old man was excited and determined on having his own way.He talked to John Hardy in the office of the Winesburg Savings Bank and then the two men went to the house on Elm Street to talk with Louise.They both expected her to make trouble but were mistaken.She was very quiet and when Jesse had explained his mission and had gone on at some length about the advantages to come through having the boy out of doors and in the quiet atmosphere of the old farmhouse, she nodded her head in approval.“It is an atmosphere not corrupted by my presence,” she said sharply.Her shoulders shook and she seemed about to fly into a fit of temper.“It is a place for a man child, although it was never a place for me,” she went on.“You never wanted me there and of course the air of your house did me no good.It was like poison in my blood but it will be different with him.”"
"路易丝转身走出了房间，留下两个男人尴尬地默然相对。之后，她和往常的做法一样，在自己的房间里呆了好些天。甚至直到孩子的衣服收拾好，孩子也被带走了，她都没有出现。失去儿子在她的生活里划下了一道深深的伤痕，她几乎都懒得同丈夫吵架了。事实上，约翰·哈代认为这一切变化都非常好。","Louise turned and went out of the room, leaving the two men to sit in embarrassed silence.As very often happened she later stayed in her room for days.Even when the boy’s clothes were packed and he was taken away she did not appear.The loss of her son made a sharp break in her life and she seemed less inclined to quarrel with her husband.John Hardy thought it had all turned out very well indeed."
"于是，小大卫便同老杰西住进了本特利农场。这位老农场主的两个姐姐还健在，仍住在那里。她们都挺害怕杰西。他在的时候，她们便很少说话。其中一个女人曾因年轻时有一头耀眼的红发而引人注目。她是个天生的母亲，于是就担任起了照顾孩子的工作。每晚大卫上床后，她就来到他的房间，坐在地板上直到他入睡。当他昏昏欲睡时，她就变得胆大了，开始喃喃地絮叨起来，大卫后来觉得自己一定是在做梦。","And so young David went to live in the Bentley farmhouse with Jesse.Two of the old farmer’s sisters were alive and still lived in the house.They were afraid of Jesse and rarely spoke when he was about.One of the women who had been noted for her flaming red hair when she was younger was a born mother and became the boy’s caretaker.Every night when he had gone to bed she went into his room and sat on the floor until he fell asleep.When he became drowsy she became bold and whispered things that he later thought he must have dreamed."
"这位姑婆声音低沉柔和，用各种昵称叫着他；他梦见母亲来找他，完全变成了他离家出走回来后的那副温柔的样子。他也变得大胆起来，伸出手去抚摸站在地板上的那个姑妈的脸，这使她欣喜若狂。男孩来到这儿后，老屋子里的每个人都变得快乐了。杰西·本特利的性格严厉固执，弄得屋子里人人缄默胆怯，即使是他的女儿路易丝在的时候也没能让他改变。可是，大卫的到来却改变了这一切。这就好像是上帝垂怜他，赐给了他一个儿子。","Her soft low voice called him endearing names and he dreamed that his mother had come to him and that she had changed so that she was always as she had been that time after he ran away.He also grew bold and reaching out his hand stroked the face of the woman on the floor so that she was ecstatically happy.Everyone in the old house became happy after the boy went there.The hard insistent thing in Jesse Bentley that had kept the people in the house silent and timid and that had never been dispelled by the presence of the girl Louise was apparently swept away by the coming of the boy.It was as though God had relented and sent a son to the man."
"他曾经自诩为上帝在瓦英河谷唯一忠诚的仆人，并祈求上帝通过凯瑟琳的子宫赐给他一个儿子以示首肯，如今他才觉得他的祈祷终于有了回应。尽管那时他才五十五岁，可看上去足有七十，过度的思考筹谋使他衰老。他扩张领土的努力成效卓著，山谷里几乎所有的农场都属于他，可直到大卫到来，他仍然是个极度失望的人。","The man who had proclaimed himself the only true servant of God in all the valley of Wine Creek, and who had wanted God to send him a sign of approval by way of a son out of the womb of Katherine, began to think that at last his prayers had been answered.Although he was at that time only fifty-five years old he looked seventy and was worn out with much thinking and scheming.The effort he had made to extend his land holdings had been successful and there were few farms in the valley that did not belong to him, but until David came he was a bitterly disappointed man."
"杰西·本特利的心里有两股力量在起作用，终其一生，这两股力量都在他脑子里相互厮杀搏斗。其一是他身上传统的东西。他希望成为上帝的仆人，并成为众人的领袖。他夜间在田野丛林里的漫步使得他亲近自然，然而，这个狂热的宗教信徒身上又有种力量向自然之力奔涌而出。凯瑟琳生的是女儿而非儿子这个事实使他失望，就好像有个看不见的人伸手狠狠打了他一拳，这个打击从而多少压制了他的妄自尊大。他仍然相信上帝会在任何时候从风中或者云里现身，可他不再要求亲眼目睹。取而代之的是，他为此而祈祷。有时他也会十分怀疑，认为上帝已经遗弃了这个世界。他抱怨自己命运不济，不能生在更单纯、甜蜜的年代，那时的人们听从天空中一片奇云的召唤就舍弃家园，去荒野中创造新的民族。在他日以继夜增加农场的产量和扩张土地的时候，他遗憾自己不能将这使不完的劲儿用来建造庙宇、宰杀异徒，以及一切在这个世上传扬上帝美名的事情。","There were two influences at work in Jesse Bentley and all his life his mind had been a battleground for these influences.First there was the old thing in him.He wanted to be a man of God and a leader among men of God.His walking in the fields and through the forests at night had brought him close to nature and there were forces in the passionately religious man that ran out to the forces in nature.The disappointment that had come to him when a daughter and not a son had been born to Katherine had fallen upon him like a blow struck by some unseen hand and the blow had somewhat softened his egotism.He still believed that God might at any moment make himself manifest out of the winds or the clouds, but he no longer demanded such recognition.Instead he prayed for it.Sometimes he was altogether doubtful and thought God had deserted the world.He regretted the fate that had not let him live in a simpler and sweeter time when at the beckoning of some strange cloud in the sky men left their lands and houses and went forth into the wilderness to create new races.While he worked night and day to make his farms more productive and to extend his holdings of land, he regretted that he could not use his own restless energy in the building of temples, the slaying of unbelievers and in general in the work of glorifying God’s name on earth."
"这是杰西曾渴望的事情，当时，他也曾渴望些别的东西。他在美国内战后长大成人，和那个时代的所有人一样，他被当时正在萌芽的现代工业主义在乡下的深远影响所触动。他开始购买机器，这使他在从事农场工作的时候可以减少雇佣人手。有时他甚至想，如果再年轻些，他会完全放弃农场工作，到温斯堡去开个工厂生产机器。杰西养成了阅读报纸和杂志的习惯。他还发明了一种用铁丝来做篱笆的机器。他模糊地意识到，时常盘桓在他脑海里的那种旧时代和地方的气氛同他人心里所想是大相径庭的。这是世界历史上最物质化的时代的开始：战争可以不为保家卫国；人类遗忘了上帝，只关注道德尺度；服务的意愿被权势的渴望所替代；美全然被置诸脑后，人们一股脑地热衷于获取财富。这个年代正在向杰西倾述它的历史，正如它向杰西周围的人倾诉一样。他变得贪婪，想要比耕作土地更快地获得金钱。他不止一次到温斯堡同女婿约翰·哈代谈及此事。“你是一个银行家，有我不可能有的机会。”他两眼灼灼地说，“我一直在想这件事。这个国家会发生大事，人们能赚到比我曾梦想过的更多的钱。你会实现这一切的。我真希望自己能年轻些，能有你这样的好机会。”杰西·本特利在银行的办公室里来回走着，越说越激动。他人生中曾有一次险些瘫痪，左半边身体因为后遗症不大灵活。说话的时候，他左边的眼睑抽搐。后来他驾车回家，当夜幕降临，繁星闪烁，他再难找回旧时那种同上帝亲近的感觉：住在天上的那位上帝随时会向他伸出手，触摸他的肩膀，托付他去完成某种英雄般的工作。杰西的心思完全被报纸杂志上的报道吸引——一些精明的买卖人几乎不费吹灰之力便发了财。对他而言，大卫的到来重新鼓起了他的旧时信仰，仿佛上帝最终眷顾于他。","That is what Jesse hungered for and then also he hungered for something else.He had grown into maturity in America in the years after the Civil War and he, like all men of his time, had been touched by the deep influences that were at work in the country during those years when modern industrialism was being born.He began to buy machines that would permit him to do the work of the farms while employing fewer men and he sometimes thought that if he were a younger man he would give up farming altogether and start a factory in Winesburg for the making of machinery.Jesse formed the habit of reading newspapers and magazines.He invented a machine for the making of fence out of wire.Faintly he realized that the atmosphere of old times and places that he had always cultivated in his own mind was strange and foreign to the thing that was growing up in the minds of others.The beginning of the most materialistic age in the history of the world, when wars would be fought without patriotism, when men would forget God and only pay attention to moral standards, when the will to power would replace the will to serve and beauty would be well-nigh forgotten in the terrible headlong rush of mankind toward the acquiring of possessions, was telling its story to Jesse the man of God as it was to the men about him.The greedy thing in him wanted to make money faster than it could be made by tilling the land.More than once he went into Winesburg to talk with his son-in-law John Hardy about it.“You are a banker and you will have chances I never had,” he said and his eyes shone.“I am thinking about it all the time.Big things are going to be done in the country and there will be more money to be made than I ever dreamed of.You get into it.I wish I were younger and had your chance.”Jesse Bentley walked up and down in the bank office and grew more and more excited as he talked.At one time in his life he had been threatened with paralysis and his left side remained somewhat weakened.As he talked his left eyelid twitched.Later when he drove back home and when night came on and the stars came out it was harder to get back the old feeling of a close and personal God who lived in the sky overhead and who might at any moment reach out his hand, touch him on the shoulder, and appoint for him some heroic task to be done.Jesse’s mind was fixed upon the things read in newspapers and magazines, on fortunes to be made almost without effort by shrewd men who bought and sold.For him the coming of the boy David did much to bring back with renewed force the old faith and it seemed to him that God had at last looked with favor upon him."
"对来到农场的大卫来说，生活正以无数种崭新又愉快的方式向他敞开怀抱。周遭所有的人对他都慈爱有加，这使他安静的天性变得开朗起来，逐渐改变了他同周围人在一起时半是胆怯半是犹疑的样子。整个白天，他都在马厩、田野里历险，或驾车同外公从一个农场驰骋到另一个农场，等晚上上床睡觉时，他几乎想要拥抱房子里的每个人。如果每晚来他房间坐在他床边的那位姑婆婆雪莉·本特利没有马上出现，他便会跑到楼梯头上大声喊叫，那稚嫩的声音在惯常寂静无声的狭窄走道里回响。清晨，当他醒来，静静地躺在床上时，从窗口飘进来的声音总让他满心喜悦。他战栗地想起温斯堡家里的生活和妈妈那总是让他浑身发抖的生气的声音。然而，这乡村里的所有声音都是令人愉快的。天亮，他起床的时候，房子后面的谷场上也开始有人工作了。人们在房子里四处走动。一个农场帮工捅着傻姑娘伊莱扎·斯托顿的肋骨，惹得她大声咯咯地笑。远处，一只奶牛在田野里哞哞叫唤，牲畜棚里的牛群应和着。另一个农场帮工正在马棚门边呵斥被洗刷的马匹。大卫从床上跳起来，跑到窗边。所有嘈杂的人声都令他兴奋，他不禁好奇，此刻镇上的妈妈正在房子里做什么。","As for the boy on the farm, life began to reveal itself to him in a thousand new and delightful ways.The kindly attitude of all about him expanded his quiet nature and he lost the half timid, hesitating manner he had always had with his people.At night when he went to bed after a long day of adventures in the stables, in the fields, or driving about from farm to farm with his grandfather, he wanted to embrace everyone in the house.If Sherley Bentley, the woman who came each night to sit on the floor by his bedside, did not appear at once, he went to the head of the stairs and shouted, his young voice ringing through the narrow halls where for so long there had been a tradition of silence.In the morning when he awoke and lay still in bed, the sounds that came in to him through the windows filled him with delight.He thought with a shudder of the life in the house in Winesburg and of his mother’s angry voice that had always made him tremble.There in the country all sounds were pleasant sounds.When he awoke at dawn the barnyard back of the house also awoke.In the house people stirred about.Eliza Stoughton the half-witted girl was poked in the ribs by a farm hand and giggled noisily, in some distant field a cow bawled and was answered by the cattle in the stables, and one of the farm hands spoke sharply to the horse he was grooming by the stable door.David leaped out of bed and ran to a window.All of the people stirring about excited his mind, and he wondered what his mother was doing in the house in town."
"从他房间的窗户不能直接看到谷场，在那里，农场的帮工们现在都已集合起来开始了早晨的工作。可是，他能听到他们的声音和马匹的嘶鸣。当有人大笑起来，他也不禁笑了。他从开着的窗户探出头去，看到果园里有只肥母猪在闲逛，身后还跟了一群小猪仔。每天清晨，他都会数数猪。“四、五、六、七。”他慢慢地说，将手指沾湿，在窗台上上上下下地划着竖线。大卫跑去赶紧将裤子和衬衣穿好。他忽然有种要冲出门去的强烈愿望。每天早晨，他下楼时都弄出很大的声响，管家考利婶婶常说他是要把房子给拆掉。等他跑过长长的老房子，将身后的门砰地关上，他来到谷场上，带着吃惊的神情四处张望，满怀期待。在他看来，晚上这里可能发生过一些惊人的大事。农场帮工们望着他大笑起来。一个从杰西接管这里便开始在这里工作的老帮工亨利·斯特雷德，在大卫来之前，没人知道他会说笑话。现在，他每天早晨都会讲同一个笑话。大卫觉得非常有趣，拍着巴掌哈哈大笑。“看，过来看啊，”老人大声叫道，“杰西爷爷的白色母马把穿在脚上的黑色长袜子给撕烂了。”","From the windows of his own room he could not see directly into the barnyard where the farm hands had now all assembled to do the morning shores, but he could hear the voices of the men and the neighing of the horses.When one of the men laughed, he laughed also.Leaning out at the open window, he looked into an orchard where a fat sow wandered about with a litter of tiny pigs at her heels.Every morning he counted the pigs.“Four, five, six, seven,” he said slowly, wetting his finger and making straight up and down marks on the window ledge.David ran to put on his trousers and shirt.A feverish desire to get out of doors took possession of him.Every morning he made such a noise coming down stairs that Aunt Callie, the housekeeper, declared he was trying to tear the house down.When he had run through the long old house, shutting the doors behind him with a bang, he came into the barnyard and looked about with an amazed air of expectancy.It seemed to him that in such a place tremendous things might have happened during the night.The farm hands looked at him and laughed.Henry Strader, an old man who had been on the farm since Jesse came into possession and who before David’s time had never been known to make a joke, made the same joke every morning.It amused David so that he laughed and clapped his hands.“See, come here and look,” cried the old man.“Grandfather Jesse’s white mare has tom the black stocking she wears on her foot.”"
"在漫长的夏季里，杰西·本特利每天都驾车在瓦英河谷的农场里来回奔驰，他的外孙也同他一起。他们驾着一辆舒适的旧马车，由一匹白马拉着。老人捋着稀薄的白胡子，自言自语地谈起他要增加他们看过的这片农田的产量的计划，还有上帝在众人制定的计划中所扮演的角色。有时他看着大卫，高兴地微笑着，可接着，有很长一段时间，他又像是忘了孩子的存在。现在，他每天都越来越多地回想起当初刚离开城市，并以农场为家时那些充斥在他脑子里的梦想。一天下午，他完全进入梦魇的样子把大卫吓坏了。他让孩子做见证，自己举行了一场仪式，结果导致了一场事故，几乎毁掉了两人之间日益深厚的情谊。","Day after day through the long summer, Jesse Bentley drove from farm to farm up and down the valley of Wine Creek, and his grandson went with him.They rode in a comfortable old phaeton drawn by the white horse.The old man scratched his thin white beard and talked to himself of his plans for increasing the productiveness of the fields they visited and of God’s part in the plans all men made.Sometimes he looked at David and smiled happily and then for a long time he appeared to forget the boy’s existence.More and more every day now his mind turned back again to the dreams that had filled his mind when he had first come out of the city to live on the land.One afternoon he startled David by letting his dreams take entire possession of him.With the boy as a witness, he went through a ceremony and brought about an accident that nearly destroyed the companionship that was growing up between them."
"杰西同外孙驱车前往离家几英里的一个河谷偏远处。路边有一片森林，瓦英河穿过林区，蜿蜒地流过林林总总的石头，流向远处的一条河流。整个下午，杰西都沉浸在深思中，现在他开始说话了。他回想起了某个深恐有巨人来抢劫财物的夜晚。而且，和他在田野里奔跑，高声祈求儿子的那个夜晚一样，他变得激动起来，近乎疯狂。他停住马，从车上下来，叫大卫也下了车。两人翻过一道围栏，沿着小溪的河岸走。孩子没注意到外公在一旁喃喃自语，只是挨着他奔跑，好奇接下来会发生什么。看到一只野兔跳起来，穿过树林跑掉时，他高兴得拍着巴掌跳起舞来。他看着那些高大的树木，非常遗憾自己不是只小动物，不能毫不畏惧地爬到高处。他蹲下来捡起一块小石子，从他外公的头上扔过去，石子掉进了一丛灌木丛里。“快起来，小家伙。爬到树顶上去。”他尖声地大声叫着。","Jesse and his grandson were driving in a distant part of the valley some miles from home.A forest came down to the road and through the forest Wine Creek wriggled its way over stones toward a distant river.All the afternoon Jesse had been in a meditative mood and now he began to talk.His mind went back to the night when he had been frightened by thoughts of a giant that might come to rob and plunder him of his possessions, and again as on that night when he had run through the fields crying for a son, he became excited to the edge of insanity.Stopping the horse he got out of the buggy and asked David to get out also.The two climbed over a fence and walked along the bank of the stream.The boy paid no attention to the muttering of his grandfather, but ran along beside him and wondered what was going to happen.When a rabbit jumped up and ran away through the woods, he clapped his hands and danced with delight.He looked at the tall trees and was sorry that he was not a little animal to climb high in the air without being frightened.Stooping, he picked up a small stone and threw it over the head of his grandfather into a clump of bushes.“Wake up, little animal.Go and climb to the top of the trees,” he shouted in a shrill voice."
"杰西·本特利在树下低着头往前走，心里躁动不安。他郑重其事的样子影响到了孩子，大卫很快变得安静，继而有些不安起来。一个念头冲入这位老人的脑海之中：他能从天上的上帝那里获得一个承诺或是一个暗示，只要他和外孙在树林的某个僻静处跪下，就能将他一直期待的奇迹变为近乎必然的事实。“正是在像这样的一个地方，另一个大卫在那里牧羊，接着他的父亲来叫他下山去找扫罗。”他喃喃地说。","Jesse Bentley went along under the trees with his head bowed and with his mind in a ferment.His earnestness affected the boy, who presently became silent and a little alarmed.Into the old man’s mind had come the notion that now he could bring from God a word or a sign out of the sky, that the presence of the boy and man on their knees in some lonely spot in the forest would make the miracle he had been waiting for almost inevitable.“It was in just such a place as this that other David tended the sheep when his father came and told him to go down unto Saul,” he muttered."
"他粗鲁地抓住孩子的肩膀，越过倒在地上的木头，来到树林一片空地前，然后他双膝跪倒，开始大声地祈祷。","Taking the boy rather roughly by the shoulder, he climbed over a fallen log and when he had come to an open place among the trees he dropped upon his knees and began to pray in a loud voice."
"大卫感到从未有过的恐惧。他蹲在一棵树下，注视着面前空地上的这个男人，双膝开始颤抖。在他看来，在他面前的不再是他的外祖父，而是个会伤害到他的陌生人，不再慈爱，而是危险粗暴。他开始哭了起来，低头捡了根小树枝，紧紧地攥在手里。杰西·本特利全副心神都集中在那个念头上，他猛地站起来朝孩子走过去，大卫更害怕了，开始全身发抖。树林里的一切仿佛被一种死寂笼罩着，突然，老人沙哑而固执的声音打破了寂静。他紧抓住孩子的肩膀，将脸转向天空大喊起来。他的整个左半边脸抽搐着，放在孩子肩上的手也抽搐不停。“赐予我神谕吧，上帝。”他喊道，“我在这里，和这个名叫大卫的孩子一起。请您从天上降临人间，显显灵吧。”","A kind of terror he had never known before took possession of David.Crouching beneath a tree he watched the man on the ground before him and his own knees began to tremble.It seemed to him that he was in the presence not only of his grandfather but of someone else, someone who might hurt him, someone who was not kindly but dangerous and brutal.He began to cry and reaching down picked up a small stick, which he held tightly gripped in his fingers.When Jesse Bentley, absorbed in his own idea, suddenly arose and advanced toward him, his terror grew until his whole body shook.In the woods an intense silence seemed to lie over everything and suddenly out of the silence came the old man’s harsh and insistent voice.Gripping the boy’s shoulders, Jesse turned his face to the sky and shouted.The whole left side of his face twitched and his hand on the boy’s shoulder twitched also.“Make a sign to me, God,” he cried.“Here I stand with the boy David.Come down to me out of the sky and make Thy presence known to me.”"
"大卫惊恐地大叫一声，从外公手里挣脱出来，转身逃离了树林。他根本不相信，刚刚那个仰着脸朝天空用沙哑的声音大喊大叫的人是他的外公。那个人看上去不像外公。他深信，一定是发生了什么奇怪、可怕的事，是某种神奇的力量使一个陌生、危险的人进入到了原本慈爱的外公的体内。他伤心地哭着，一路不停地跑下山坡。他绊倒在一棵树的树根上，磕到了头，接着，他站了起来，试图再接着跑。他的头很痛，不久便跌倒在地上躺着不动了。杰西将他抱到马车上，他醒来时，发现老人的手正慈爱地抚摩着他的头。直到那时，他心里的恐惧才消失。“带我走。树林后面有个可怕的人。”他坚定地大声说。可杰西眺望着树顶，嘴里又开始对上帝念念有词，“上帝啊，您并不赞同我的所为。”他轻声低语，反复地说着那些话，驾着车沿着公路飞驰，将孩子流着血的头轻轻地靠在自己的肩膀上。","With a cry of fear, David turned and, shaking himself loose from the hands that held him, ran away through the forest.He did not believe that the man who turned up his face and in a harsh voice shouted at the sky was his grandfather at all.The man did not look like his grandfather.The conviction that something strange and terrible had happened, that by some miracle a new and dangerous person had come into the body of the kindly old man, took possession of him.On and on he ran down the hillside, sobbing as he ran.When he fell over the roots of a tree and in falling struck his head, he arose and tried to run on again.His head hurt so that presently he fell down and lay still, but it was only after Jesse had carried him to the buggy and he awoke to find the old man’s hand stroking his head tenderly that the terror left him.“Take me away.There is a terrible man back there in the woods,” he declared firmly, while Jesse looked away over the tops of the trees and again his lips cried out to God.“What have I done that Thou dost not approve of me,” he whispered softly, saying the words over and over as he drove rapidly along the road with the boy’s cut and bleeding head held tenderly against his shoulder."
"三 屈服","III Surrender"
"路易丝·本特利嫁给了约翰·哈代，并住在温斯堡埃尔姆大街的一间砖头房子里。她的故事是一个关于误解的故事。要理解路易丝这类女人并使她们的生活有意义，需要大费周章。　得写上几本有深度的书，周边的人还得过一段深思熟虑的生活。","The story of Louise Bentley, who became Mrs. John Hardy and lived with her husband in a brick house on Elm Street in Winesburg, is a story of misunderstanding.Before such women as Louise can be understood and their lives made livable, much will have to be done.Thoughtful books will have to be written and thoughtful lives lived by people about them."
"她有一个纤弱而过度劳累的母亲，还有一个冲动、严厉而富于想象力的父亲；父亲并不希望她降临于世。从儿时起，路易丝就有些神经质，属于过度敏感的女性。工业化主义发展到后期，这样的女性便越来越多。","Born of a delicate and overworked mother, and an impulsive, hard, imaginative father, who did not look with favor upon her coming into the world, Louise was from childhood a neurotic, one of the race of over-sensitive women that in later days industrialism was to bring in such great numbers into the world."
"她幼年住在本特利农场的时候，是一个沉默又阴郁的孩子，极度渴望被爱却得不到。等她长到十五岁，便住到了温斯堡阿尔伯特·哈代家里。此人经营一间出售马车和货车的商店，同时也是镇上教育委员会的一员。","During her early years she lived on the Bentley farm, a silent, moody child, wanting love more than anything else in the world and not getting it.When she was fifteen she went to live in Winesburg with the family of Albert Hardy, who had a store for the sale of buggies and wagons, and who was a member of the town board of education."
"路易丝到镇上读温斯堡高中，她住在哈代家，是因为阿尔伯特同她父亲是朋友。","Louise went into town to be a student in the Winesburg High School and she went to live at the Hardys’ because Albert Hardy and her father were friends."
"温斯堡车商哈代同那个时代的其他千千万万人一样，热衷于教育问题。他在世上建功立业，并未借助书本上的知识，但他深信，若是读过书，他就能做得更好。他对每个光临的客人谈及此事，在家里也总是重弹旧调，惹人厌烦。","Hardy, the vehicle merchant of Winesburg, like thousands of other men of his times, was an enthusiast on the subject of education.He had made his own way in the world without learning got from books, but he was convinced that had he but known books things would have gone better with him.To everyone who came into his shop he talked of the matter, and in his own household he drove his family distracted by his constant harping on the subject."
"他有两个女儿，还有一个儿子——约翰·哈代；女儿们曾不止一次吵着要一起休学。在学业上，她们遵循着得过且过的原则。“我讨厌书本，也讨厌爱读书的人。”妹妹哈丽雅特情绪激昂地宣布道。","He had two daughters and one son, John Hardy, and more than once the daughters threatened to leave school altogether.As a matter of principle they did just enough work in their classes to avoid punishment.“I hate books and I hate anyone who likes books,” Harriet, the younger of the two girls, declared passionately."
"路易丝在温斯堡同在农场一样不快乐。多年来，她一心希望走出去见见世面，她把住进哈代家看作奔向自由的重要一步。每当她思及此事，都会觉得小镇必定是充满欢乐、生机勃勃的，那里男男女女幸福自在地共处，共享友谊与爱情，那感觉就像微风拂过脸颊一般。经历了本特利家沉寂而无趣的生活后，她梦想着走进那种温暖又洋溢着生命和现实的氛围里。在哈代家，路易丝本可以得到她曾如此渴望的东西，却因为她刚到镇里时的一个过失使这一切化为泡影。","In Winesburg as on the farm Louise was not happy.For years she had dreamed of the time when she could go forth into the world, and she looked upon the move into the Hardy household as a great step in the direction of freedom.Always when she had thought of the matter, it had seemed to her that in town all must be gaiety and life, that there men and women must live happily and freely, giving and taking friendship and affection as one takes the feel of a wind on the cheek.After the silence and the cheerlessness of life in the Bentley house, she dreamed of stepping forth into an atmosphere that was warm and pulsating with life and reality.And in the Hardy household Louise might have got something of the thing for which she so hungered but for a mistake she made when she had just come to town."
"她在学校学习勤奋刻苦，使得她遭到了哈代姐妹玛丽同哈丽雅特的冷落。她一直到学校开学才搬进哈代家，因此关于姐妹俩对学习的看法这事，她一无所知。她性格胆怯，开头的一个月里没有交什么朋友。每周五下午，农场会派来帮工驾车将她从温斯堡接回家度周末，因此她没和镇上的人一起过周六的假期。由于局促不安、性情孤僻，她便专心向学。在玛丽和哈丽雅特看来，她似乎在用自己的优秀给她们找麻烦。她急于表现良好，便想答上老师在课堂上提出的每个问题。她跳来跳去，眼睛忽闪着。当她答出班里其他学生不会的问题时，便高兴地微笑。“看吧，我替你们做出来了。”她的眼睛仿佛在说，“你们不需要再费劲了。我能答出所有的问题。只要我在，全班都能轻松些。”","Louise won the disfavor of the two Hardy girls, Mary and Harriet, by her application to her studies in school.She did not come to the house until the day when school was to begin and knew nothing of the feeling they had in the matter.She was timid and during the first month made no acquaintances.Every Friday afternoon one of the hired men from the farm drove into Winesburg and took her home for the weekend, so that she did not spend the Saturday holiday with the town people.Because she was embarrassed and lonely she worked constantly at her studies.To Mary and Harriet, it seemed as though she tried to make trouble for them by her proficiency.In her eagerness to appear well Louise wanted to answer every question put to the class by the teacher.She jumped up and down and her eyes flashed.Then when she had answered some question the others in the class had been unable to answer, she smiled happily.“See, I have done it for you,” her eyes seemed to say.“You need not bother about the matter.I will answer all questions.For the whole class it will be easy while I am here.”"
"在哈代家，晚上用过晚餐后，阿尔伯特便开始夸赞路易丝。有个老师非常赞赏她，因此他也觉得高兴。“哎，我又听说了，”他开口说道，严厉地望着自己的女儿们，然后转过头去朝路易丝微笑着，“又有一个老师向我表扬了路易丝做的功课。温斯堡的每个人都在告诉我她很聪明。令我感到惭愧的是，他们没有这样夸我的女儿们。”这位商人站起身来，在房里走来走去，点了一支晚上抽的雪茄。","In the evening after supper in the Hardy house, Albert Hardy began to praise Louise.One of the teachers had spoken highly of her and he was delighted.“Well, again I have heard of it,” he began, looking hard at his daughters and then turning to smile at Louise.“Another of the teachers has told me of the good work Louise is doing.Everyone in Winesburg is telling me how smart she is.I am ashamed that they do not speak so of my own girls.”Arising, the merchant marched about the room and lighted his evening cigar."
"他的两个女儿对望了一眼，无奈地摇了摇头。父亲见到她们如此漠然，便生起气来了。“我跟你们说，你们两个该好好想想了，”他大声说着，怒视着她们，“现在美国正在经历巨变，只有学知识才是你们这代人的唯一出路。路易丝是有钱人家的孩子，可她却能不耻向学。和她相比，你们真该觉得羞愧。”","The two girls looked at each other and shook their heads wearily.Seeing their indifference the father became angry.“I tell you it is something for you two to be thinking about,” he cried, glaring at them.“There is a big change coming here in America and in learning is the only hope of the coming generations.Louise is the daughter of a rich man but she is not ashamed to study.It should make you ashamed to see what she does.”"
"商人从门边的帽架上拿下帽子，打算晚上出门。他在门边停了一下，回头狠狠地瞪了一眼。他的目光太过凶狠，以至于路易丝被吓得逃回了楼上自己的房间。哈代姐妹俩开始谈论起自己的事情来。“给我听着，”她们的父亲大声咆哮着，“你们这些不动脑筋的懒丫头。你们对教育的漠然正在影响着你们的性格。你们会一事无成的。现在记住我说的话——路易丝会一直把你们甩得远远的，你们永远也追不上。”","The merchant took his hat from a rack by the door and prepared to depart for the evening.At the door he stopped and glared back.So fierce was his manner that Louise was frightened and ran upstairs to her own room.The daughters began to speak of their own affairs.“Pay attention to me,” roared the merchant.“Your minds are lazy.Your indifference to education is affecting your characters.You will amount to nothing.Now mark what I say—Louise will be so far ahead of you that you will never catch up.”"
"这位懊恼的父亲走出家门来到街上，全身气得发抖。他一路走着，口里咕咕哝哝地低声抱怨着、咒骂着，可当他走到大街上，他的愤怒就烟消云散了。他停下来同其他的某个商人或是刚进城的某个农夫谈起了天气或庄稼收成，将女儿们忘得一干二净了。假使他想起来，也不过是耸耸肩。“咳，算了，女孩子总归是女孩子。”他颇有哲理地唠叨着。","The distracted man went out of the house and into the street shaking with wrath.He went along muttering words and swearing, but when he got into Main Street his anger passed.He stopped to talk of the weather or the crops with some other merchant or with a farmer who had come into town and forgot his daughters altogether or, if he thought of them, only shrugged his shoulders.“Oh, well, girls will be girls,” he muttered philosophically."
"在他的家里，当路易丝从房间里下楼来的时候，那两姐妹坐在那里，谁也不愿理睬她。路易丝在那里住了六周多后，一个夜晚，她因为常常遭遇这种冷淡的氛围而伤心不已，放声大哭起来。“别哭了，回你自己的房间去读书吧！”玛丽·哈代尖刻地说。","In the house when Louise came down into the room where the two girls sat, they would have nothing to do with her.One evening after she had been there for more than six weeks and was heartbroken because of the continued air of coldness with which she was always greeted, she burst into tears.“Shut up your crying and go back to your own room and to your books,” Mary Hardy said sharply."
"路易丝住的房间在哈代家二楼，窗户正对着一个果园。房间里有个炉子，每晚小约翰·哈代都捧来一抱木柴放在靠墙放着的箱子里。路易丝来这儿的第二个月后就彻底放弃了同哈代姐妹友好共处的希望，晚饭一结束便回到自己的房间。","The room occupied by Louise was on the second floor of the Hardy house, and her window looked out upon an orchard.There was a stove in the room and every evening young John Hardy carried up an armful of wood and put it in a box that stood by the wall.During the second month after she came to the house, Louise gave up all hope of getting on a friendly footing with the Hardy girls and went to her own room as soon as the evening meal was at an end."
"她开始考虑同约翰·哈代交朋友。当他抱着木柴进到房间里时，她假装忙于学习，却在仔细地观察他。等他把木柴放进箱子，转身出去的时候，她低下头，脸红了。她试图同他交谈可又开不了口，等他走了，她又为自己的愚笨感到生气。这个农场姑娘的脑海里满是同那个年轻人拉近距离的想法。她想，或许能在他身上找到她一直以来在人们身上寻觅的那种品质。在她看来，她同世上所有其他人之间横亘着一堵墙。她生活在某种温暖的生活内圆的边缘，这种内圆世界必定是对其他人完全敞开的，也是可以理解的。她沉迷于这个想法里，也许就需要她一个有勇气的行动来使自己同其他人之间的关系变得全然不同，那样也许就能有一个全新的生活，就好像开启了一扇门，进入了另一个房间。她日以继夜地想着这个问题，可尽管她那么热切向往的东西是非常温暖而亲密的，但却和性没有丝毫有意的联系。这个想法并不确定，她看中约翰这个人不过因为他近在左右，而且不像他的姐妹们那样敌视她。","Her mind began to play with thoughts of making friends with John Hardy.When he came into the room with the wood in his arms, she pretended to be busy with her studies but watched him eagerly.When he had put the wood in the box and turned to go out, she put down her head and blushed.She tried to make talk but could say nothing, and after he had gone she was angry at herself for her stupidity.The mind of the country girl became filled with the idea of drawing close to the young man.She thought that in him might be found the quality she had all her life been seeking in people.It seemed to her that between herself and all the other people in the world, a wall had been built up and that she was living just on the edge of some warm inner circle of life that must be quite open and understandable to others.She became obsessed with the thought that it wanted but a courageous act on her part to make all of her association with people something quite different, and that it was possible by such an act to pass into a new life as one opens a door and goes into a room.Day and night she thought of the matter, but although the thing she wanted so earnestly was something very warm and close it had as yet no conscious connection with sex.It had not become that definite, and her mind had only alighted upon the person of John Hardy because he was at hand and unlike his sisters had not been unfriendly to her."
"哈代姐妹——玛丽和哈丽雅特——都比路易丝大。在对这个世界的认识上，她们要老道得多。她们像所有中西部小镇上的年轻女孩那样生活着。在那时，年轻女孩们不会离开镇子到东部的大学去上学，也几乎不存在社会阶层的想法。工人的女儿同农夫或者商人的女儿社会地位完全平等，没有什么有闲阶级。评价一个女孩的标准只有“漂亮”或者“不漂亮”。一个漂亮的姑娘周日和周三晚便会有年轻男子上门求见。有时，她也会同那名追求者去参加舞会或教堂的社交。其余的时候，她在家中接待他，并拨有专门的会客室。没有人进去打搅。两个年轻人关起门来呆上好几个小时。有时，灯光被调暗，年轻男女拥抱在一起。双颊嫣红，发丝凌乱。一两年后，若是他们之间的激情足够强烈和持久，他们便会结婚。","The Hardy sisters, Mary and Harriet, were both older than Louise.In a certain kind of knowledge of the world they were years older.They lived as all of the young women of Middle Western towns lived.In those days young women did not go out of our towns to Eastern colleges and ideas in regard to social classes had hardly begun to exist.A daughter of a laborer was in much the same social position as a daughter of a farmer or a merchant, and there were no leisure classes.A girl was “nice” or she was “not nice.”If a nice girl, she had a young man who came to her house to see her on Sunday and on Wednesday evenings.Sometimes she went with her young man to a dance or a church social.At other times she received him at the house and was given the use of the parlor for that purpose.No one intruded upon her.For hours the two sat behind closed doors.Sometimes the lights were turned low and the young man and woman embraced.Cheeks became hot and hair disarranged.After a year or two, if the impulse within them became strong and insistent enough, they married."
"路易丝在温斯堡的第一个冬天的某个夜晚，经历了一次奇遇，使得她有了一种新的冲动，想去打破同约翰·哈代之间的那堵墙。那是一个星期三，阿尔伯特一吃完晚饭便戴上帽子出门去了。年轻的约翰将木柴放进路易丝房间的箱子里。“你真的很用功，对吧？”他讷讷地说道，然后在她反应过来之前就出去了。","One evening during her first winter in Winesburg, Louise had an adventure that gave a new impulse to her desire to break down the wall that she thought stood between her and John Hardy.It was Wednesday and immediately after the evening meal Albert Hardy put on his hat and went away.Young John brought the wood and put it in the box in Louise’s room.“You do work hard, don’t you?” he said awkwardly, and then before she could answer he also went away."
"路易丝听到他走出房子的声音，有股疯狂的冲动想追出去。她打开窗户，探出身子，轻声叫道，“约翰，亲爱的约翰，回来，别走。”天上有云，黑暗中她看不清楚，可当她等待时，她想象着自己能听到一种轻微的响声，像是有个人踮着脚穿过果园里的果树。她害怕起来，迅速关上了窗户。她在房间里来回走动了一个小时，激动地颤抖着。当她再也无法忍受这等待的时候，她就轻轻地溜过走廊，下楼来到一间类似壁橱的房间，那里有门通往会客室。","Louise heard him go out of the house and had a mad desire to run after him.Opening her window she leaned out and called softly, “John, dear John, come back, don’t go away.”The night was cloudy and she could not see far into the darkness, but as she waited she fancied she could hear a soft little noise as of someone going on tiptoes through the trees in the orchard.She was frightened and closed the window quickly. For an hour she moved about the room trembling with excitement and when she could not longer bear the waiting, she crept into the hall and down the stairs into a closet-like room that opened off the parlor."
"路易丝决定将数周来盘桓在脑海里的那个勇敢之举付诸实施。她相信约翰·哈代已经藏身在她窗下的果园里，她决意找到他并告诉他，她希望他同她接近，拥她入怀，告诉她他的想法和梦想，也希望他能倾听她的想法和梦想。“黑暗里比较容易说话。”她低声自语道，同时站在小房子里，摸索着朝门走去。","Louise had decided that she would perform the courageous act that had for weeks been in her mind.She was convinced that John Hardy had concealed himself in the orchard beneath her window and she was determined to find him and tell him that she wanted him to come close to her, to hold her in his arms, to tell her of his thoughts and dreams and to listen while she told him her thoughts and dreams.“In the darkness it will be easier to say things,” she whispered to herself, as she stood in the little room groping for the door."
"就在那时，路易丝突然意识到她并不是独自一人在这房子里。门那头的会客室里有个男人在轻声说话，接着，门开了。路易丝刚来得及把自己藏在楼梯下的一小块空地里，玛丽·哈代同她那年轻的追求者就进了那间昏暗的小房间。","And then suddenly Louise realized that she was not alone in the house.In the parlor on the other side of the door a man’s voice spoke softly and the door opened.Louise just had time to conceal herself in a little opening beneath the stairway when Mary Hardy, accompanied by her young man, came into the little dark room."
"漆黑中，路易丝坐在地板上倾听了一个小时。玛丽·哈代没有说话，她同那位前来与她共度良宵的男子一道教会了这个农场姑娘什么是男女之事。她把头一直往下低，直到整个人蜷成一团，无声无息地躺在那里。在她看来，玛丽·哈代像是因为众神的一时冲动而被赋予了某种特质，她无法理解这位比她年长的女孩为什么决意要抵抗。","For an hour Louise sat on the floor in the darkness and listened.Without words Mary Hardy, with the aid of the man who had come to spend the evening with her, brought to the country girl a knowledge of men and women.Putting her head down until she was curled into a little ball she lay perfectly still.It seemed to her that by some strange impulse of the gods, a great gift had been brought to Mary Hardy and she could not understand the older woman’s determined protest."
"年轻男子抱着玛丽·哈代，亲吻着她。当她挣扎着大笑起来的时候，他却反而抱得更紧。他们之间的这场嬉戏持续了一个小时，之后便回到会客室，路易丝也逃回了楼上。“我真希望你在那儿安静些。你不能打搅到那只学习的小耗子。”当她站在楼上自己房间的门边时，听到哈丽·雅特对自己的姐姐说道。","The young man took Mary Hardy into his arms and kissed her.When she struggled and laughed, he but held her the more tightly.For an hour the contest between them went on and then they went back into the parlor and Louise escaped up the stairs.“I hope you were quiet out there.You must not disturb the little mouse at her studies,” she heard Harriet saying to her sister as she stood by her own door in the hallway above."
"路易丝给约翰·哈代写了张便条。深夜时，房里的人都睡着了，她偷偷下楼，把纸条从他门边塞了进去。她深恐如果自己不马上做这件事，勇气就会消失。她试着在便条上相当明确地了阐明了自己想要的是什么。“我想有人来爱我，也想去爱一个人。”她如是写道，“如果你就是那个人，我希望你晚上到果园里来，在我窗下弄出些声响。我能很容易地爬下窗蓬来找你。我一直在想这件事，所以，如果你真打算来就要快。”","Louise wrote a note to John Hardy and late that night, when all in the house were asleep, she crept downstairs and slipped it under his door.She was afraid that if she did not do the thing at once her courage would fail.In the note she tried to be quite definite about what she wanted.“I want someone to love me and I want to love someone,” she wrote.“If you are the one for me I want you to come into the orchard at night and make a noise under my window.It will be easy for me to crawl down over the shed and come to you.I am thinking about it all the time, so if you are to come at all you must come soon.”"
"很长一段时间里，路易丝都不知道她想为自己找个情人的鲁莽举动会有什么结果。在某种意义上，她也弄不明白自己究竟是否希望他来。有时候，她似乎觉得被人紧紧抱住并亲吻是生活的全部秘密，但随之一种新的冲动袭来，她怕得要死。女人自古以来情愿被男人占有的欲望已经占据了她的心灵，可她的人生准则是如此模糊，仿佛她只想让约翰的手碰到她的手便会满足。她很想知道他是否明白这些。第二天，当阿尔伯特·哈代坐在餐桌旁说话，两个女儿窃窃私语和大笑的时候，她没有朝约翰看，只规规矩矩地吃完饭后便溜之大吉。晚上，她在房子外面一直呆到确信约翰已经将木柴放进她的房间并离开了。之后的好几个夜晚，她都紧张地聆听着，却没听到来自黑暗中果园里的任何呼唤声。她心情低落，悲痛欲绝。她想自己是无法打破那堵将她同那欢乐的世界隔开的墙了。","For a long time Louise did not know what would be the outcome of her bold attempt to secure for herself a lover.In a way she still did not know whether or not she wanted him to come.Sometimes it seemed to her that to be held tightly and kissed was the whole secret of life, and then a new impulse came and she was terribly afraid.The age-old woman’s desire to be possessed had taken possession of her, but so vague was her notion of life that it seemed to her just the touch of John Hardy’s hand upon her own hand would satisfy.She wondered if he would understand that.At the table next day while Albert Hardy talked and the two girls whispered and laughed, she did not look at John but at the table and as soon as possible escaped.In the evening she went out of the house until she was sure he had taken the wood to her room and gone away.When after several evenings of intense listening she heard no call from the darkness in the orchard, she was half beside herself with grief and decided that for her there was no way to break through the wall that had shut her off from the joy of life."
"写纸条事件两三周后，一个星期一的夜晚，约翰·哈代来找她了。路易丝已经完全放弃了他会来的这个想法，所以很长一段时间，她都没有听到果园传来的叫声。上周五的晚上，当她由农场的帮工送回家去度周末的时候，一时冲动之下，做了件令自己都目瞪口呆的事情。当约翰·哈代站在窗户下的黑暗处轻声又长久地呼唤她的名字时候，她在自己房间里来回地走，好奇是怎样的冲动使她做出了这样荒唐的举动。","And then on a Monday evening two or three weeks after the writing of the note, John Hardy came for her.Louise had so entirely given up the thought of his coming that for a long time she did not hear the call that came up from the orchard.On the Friday evening before, as she was being driven back to the farm for the weekend by one of the hired men, she had on an impulse done a thing that had startled her, and as John Hardy stood in the darkness below and called her name softly and insistently, she walked about in her room and wondered what new impulse had led her to commit so ridiculous an act."
"那名农场的帮工是个有着一头黑色卷发的年轻小伙子。那周五晚上，不知什么原因他来晚了，所以他们只能在黑夜里驾车回家。路易丝满心里想的都是约翰·哈代，她试着同那个农场小伙子说话，可他太窘了，什么也说不出来。她开始回忆起童年的孤独时光，也痛苦地记起刚刚发生的那种新的强烈的孤独感。“我恨每一个人。”她突然大叫道，接着便说了一番令那名护送者惊恐万分的激烈言论。“我恨爸爸，也很哈代老头。”她愤怒地大声宣布，“我在镇上的学校上学，可我也恨上学。”","The farm hand, a young fellow with black curly hair, had come for her somewhat late on that Friday evening and they drove home in the darkness.Louise, whose mind was filled with thoughts of John Hardy, tried to make talk but the country boy was embarrassed and would say nothing.Her mind began to review the loneliness of her childhood and she remembered with a pang the sharp new loneliness that had just come to her.“I hate everyone,” she cried suddenly, and then broke forth into a tirade that frightened her escort.“I hate father and the old man Hardy, too,” she declared vehemently.“I get my lessons there in the school in town but I hate that also.”"
"路易丝转过头把脸放在那个小伙子的肩上，把他吓得更厉害了。她朦胧地希望他能像那个同玛丽站在黑暗房间里的年轻人那样，用胳膊抱住她亲吻，可这个乡下小伙子只是被吓呆了。他用鞭子赶着马，开始吹口哨。“这路不平，是吧？”他大声地说。露易丝非常生气，她伸出手一把从他头上抓下了他的帽子，扔到了路边。等他跳下马车去找帽子的时候，她驾着马车把他扔在后面，让他走回农场去。","Louise frightened the farm hand still more by turning and putting her cheek down upon his shoulder.Vaguely she hoped that he like that young man who had stood in the darkness with Mary would put his arms about her and kiss her, but the country boy was only alarmed.He struck the horse with the whip and began to whistle.“The road is rough, eh?” he said loudly.Louise was so angry that reaching up she snatched his hat from his head and threw it into the road.When he jumped out of the buggy and went to get it, she drove off and left him to walk the rest of the way back to the farm."
"路易丝·本特利把约翰·哈代当作情人。这并非她所愿，而是约翰就是这样解释她接近他的行为。她太急于去获得一些别的东西，所以也没有反抗。几个月后，他们都害怕她会怀孕，于是就在一个晚上去了县政府，结了婚。他们在哈代家住了几个月，之后就自己买了一所房子。婚后的一年里，路易丝都在试图让丈夫明白她的那种模糊而隐秘的渴望，那是她写下便条的原因，可至今仍未能被满足。她依偎在他怀里反复地谈及，可总也不能成功。约翰自有一套关于男女之爱的信条，他非但不听，反而开始亲吻她的双唇。这把她给弄懵了，最后不想被亲吻了。她也不知道自己想要什么。","Louise Bentley took John Hardy to be her lover.That was not what she wanted but it was so the young man had interpreted her approach to him, and so anxious was she to achieve something else that she made no resistance.When after a few months they were both afraid that she was about to become a mother, they went one evening to the county seat and were married.For a few months they lived in the Hardy house and then took a house of their own.All during the first year Louise tried to make her husband understand the vague and intangible hunger that had led to the writing of the note and that was still unsatisfied.Again and again she crept into his arms and tried to talk of it, but always without success.Filled with his own notions of love between men and women, he did not listen but began to kiss her upon the lips.That confused her so that in the end she did not want to be kissed.She did not know what she wanted."
"最终当怀孕一事被证实是子虚乌有的时候，她生起气来，说了些刻薄伤人心的话。后来，儿子大卫出生时，她不能哺育他，而且不知道自己是否想要他。她有时整天和儿子呆在房间里，四处走动，时不时地轻轻走过去用手温柔地触碰他，接下来的日子里，她又不想看见或靠近这个降临到她家里的小生命。当约翰指责她无情的时候，她大笑起来。“他是个男孩，无论如何都会得到想要的一切。”她尖刻地说，“假若她是个女孩，我便会为她付出一切。”","When the alarm that had tricked them into marriage proved to be groundless, she was angry and said bitter, hurtful things.Later when her son David was born, she could not nurse him and did not know whether she wanted him or not.Sometimes she stayed in the room with him all day, walking about and occasionally creeping close to touch him tenderly with her hands, and then other days came when she did not want to see or be near the tiny bit of humanity that had come into the house.When John Hardy reproached her for her cruelty, she laughed.“It is a man child and will get what it wants anyway,” she said sharply.“Had it been a woman child there is nothing in the world I would not have done for it.”"
"四 恐惧","IV Terror"
"当大卫·哈代长成为一个十五岁的高个子男孩时，像母亲一样，他也有了一次足以改变生活现状的历险。这使他从自己安静的角落里走出来，进入到了大千世界之中。他生活环境的外壳被打破，于是他被强迫前行。他离开温斯堡后，没人再在那里见过他。自他消失后，他的母亲和外公都过世了，父亲变得非常富有。他花了很多钱去寻找儿子，可那部分已不属于这个故事了。","When David Hardy was a tall boy of fifteen, he, like his mother, had an adventure that changed the whole current of his life and sent him out of his quiet corner into the world.The shell of the circumstances of his life was broken and he was compelled to start forth.He left Winesburg and no one there ever saw him again.After his disappearance, his mother and grandfather both died and his father became very rich.He spent much money in trying to locate his son, but that is no part of this story."
"那是一个深秋，一个本特利农场不同寻常的年头。到处庄稼都是大丰收。那年春天，杰西刚购进了瓦英河谷里的一长片黑色沼泽地。他低价购得这块地，却花了一大笔钱去改良它。他得挖许多沟渠，砌上大量的瓦片。左右的农夫们对这笔开销频频摇头。其中有些人甚至嘲笑杰西，希望他在这上面栽个大跟头，可老头儿一声不吭地继续他的工作。","It was in the late fall of an unusual year on the Bentley farms.Everywhere the crops had been heavy.That spring, Jesse had bought part of a long strip of black swamp land that lay in the valley of Wine Creek.He got the land at a low price but had spent a large sum of money to improve it.Great ditches had to be dug and thousands of tile laid.Neighboring farmers shook their heads over the expense.Some of them laughed and hoped that Jesse would lose heavily by the venture, but the old man went silently on with the work and said nothing."
"等到土壤被弄干后，他种上了卷心菜和洋葱，这又遭到了邻居们的嘲弄。可是，这片庄稼收成非常可观，卖价极高。于是，就在这一年里，杰西不仅赚回了修缮土地的全部成本，还有盈余，能让他再买两个农场。他喜不自禁，无法掩饰内心的喜悦。在他接管农场的历史上，这是他第一次在帮工面前露出笑脸。","When the land was drained he planted it to cabbages and onions, and again the neighbors laughed.The crop was, however, enormous and brought high prices.In the one year Jesse made enough money to pay for all the cost of preparing the land and had a surplus that enabled him to buy two more farms.He was exultant and could not conceal his delight.For the first time in all the history of his ownership of the farms, he went among his men with a smiling face."
"杰西购进大批新机器来削减人工成本，也将剩下的所有肥沃的黑色沼泽地买了下来。有一天，他去温斯堡给大卫买了一辆自行车和一套新衣服，他还给两个姐姐钱去参加在俄亥俄州克利夫兰举办的宗教集会。","Jesse bought a great many new machines for cutting down the cost of labor and all of the remaining acres in the strip of black fertile swamp land.One day he went into Winesburg and bought a bicycle and a new suit of clothes for David and he gave his two sisters money with which to go to a religious convention at Cleveland, Ohio."
"那年秋天，霜冻已至，瓦英河边森林里的树木都已变成了金黄色。大卫只要不上学，就会每时每刻呆在野外。他要么独自一人，要么和其他的男孩子一起，每个下午都到树林里去拾坚果。乡下其他的男孩子们大多是本特利农场工人的儿子。他们带着枪打野兔和松鼠，可大卫不和他们一起。他给自己用橡皮筋和叉形木棍做了一个弹弓，独自去采坚果。他一边四处走，一边也在思考。他意识到自己已经差不多是个男人了，很想知道将来要干些什么，可在还没想到一些具体的事情之前，这些想法就烟消云散了。他又变成了个小男孩。一天，他射中了一只呆在低矮的树枝上对着他叽叽喳喳的松鼠。他拿着那只松鼠跑回了家。一个姑婆把这只小动物煮了，他吃得津津有味。他把松鼠皮钉在一块木板上，用一根绳子把木板悬挂在他卧室的窗户上。","In the fall of that year when the frost came and the trees in the forests along Wine Creek were golden brown, David spent every moment when he did not have to attend school, out in the open.Alone or with other boys he went every afternoon into the woods to gather nuts.The other boys of the countryside, most of them sons of laborers on the Bentley farms, had guns with which they went hunting rabbits and squirrels, but David did not go with them.He made himself a sling with rubber bands and a forked stick and went off by himself to gather nuts.As he went about thoughts came to him.He realized that he was almost a man and wondered what he would do in life, but before they came to anything, the thoughts passed and he was a boy again.One day he killed a squirrel that sat on one of the lower branches of a tree and chattered at him.Home he ran with the squirrel in his hand.One of the Bentley sisters cooked the little animal and he ate it with great gusto.The skin he tacked on a board and suspended the board by a string from his bedroom window."
"这件事使他的想发生了新的转变。从此后，他去树林就总在口袋里带着弹弓，花上几个小时射击想象中藏匿在棕色树叶间的动物。想做大人的念头消失了，他心满意足地想做一个冲动的孩子。","That gave his mind a new turn.After that he never went into the woods without carrying the sling in his pocket and he spent hours shooting at imaginary animals concealed among the brown leaves in the trees.Thoughts of his coming manhood passed and he was content to be a boy with a boy’s impulses."
"一个周六下午，他在口袋里装着弹弓、肩上背着一袋坚果，正准备出发去树林，可外公拦住了他。老人的双眼里有种压抑的严肃的表情，那总让这个孩子有些害怕。每当这时，杰西·本特利的眼睛不会笔直地向前看，而是犹疑逡巡，似乎什么也没看。像是有种看不见的幕布将他和世界上其余的一切事物隔了开来。“我想让你跟我来。”他简短地说道，眼睛越过孩子的头顶，望向天空。“我们今天有点儿要紧事要做。如果你想的话，可以带上这袋坚果。没关系的，反正我们也要去树林。“","One Saturday morning when he was about to set off for the woods with the sling in his pocket and a bag for nuts on his shoulder, his grandfather stopped him.In the eyes of the old man was the strained serious look that always a little frightened David.At such times Jesse Bentley’s eyes did not look straight ahead but wavered and seemed to be looking at nothing.Something like an invisible curtain appeared to have come between the man and all the rest of the world.“I want you to come with me,” he said briefly, and his eyes looked over the boy’s head into the sky.“We have something important to do today.You may bring the bag for nuts if you wish.It does not matter and anyway we will be going into the woods.”"
"杰西和大卫乘着那匹白马拉着的轻便老马车从本特利农舍出发。他们沉默地走了一长段路，停在一片田野边上，那里有一群绵羊在吃草。羊群里有只不当季出生的小羊，大卫和外公抓住它，并把它紧紧捆得像只小白球。他们赶车接着往前，杰西让大卫抱着这只小羊。“我昨天看到了它，它让我想起了一直想做的事情。”他说着，又带着那种逡巡不定的眼神越过孩子的头顶看向远处。","Jesse and David set out from the Bentley farmhouse in the old phaeton that was drawn by the white horse.When they had gone along in silence for a long way they stopped at the edge of a field where a flock of sheep were grazing.Among the sheep was a lamb that had been born out of season, and this David and his grandfather caught and tied so tightly that it looked like a little white ball.When they drove on again Jesse let David hold the lamb in his arms.“I saw it yesterday and it put me in mind of what I have long wanted to do,” he said, and again he looked away over the head of the boy with the wavering, uncertain stare in his eyes."
"这个成功之年给他带来的志得意满渐渐褪去，另一种情绪占据了他的心头。很长一段时间里，他到处走动，感到极其卑微，常常祷告。他又在夜晚独自散步，想到了上帝；散步时，他又将自己同古时代的先辈们联系了起来。星空下，他跪倒在湿润的草地上，祈祷时提高了嗓音。现在，他决定像《圣经》中连篇累牍记载的圣人们那样，向上帝献祭。“上帝赐予我这大片的良田，还送给我了一个名叫大卫的男孩。”他喃喃低语，“也许我早该这么做了。”他很遗憾没在女儿路易丝出生前的日子里想到这个主意，而现在，他笃信，等他在树林里的某个偏僻处燃起一堆树枝，将羊羔的尸体作为焚烧的供物，上帝就会出现在他面前，给他神示。","After the feeling of exaltation that had come to the farmer as a result of his successful year, another mood had taken possession of him.For a long time he had been going about feeling very humble and prayerful.Again he walked alone at night thinking of God and as he walked he again connected his own figure with the figures of old days.Under the stars he knelt on the wet grass and raised up his voice in prayer.Now he had decided that like the men whose stories filled the pages of the Bible, he would make a sacrifice to God.“I have been given these abundant crops and God has also sent me a boy who is called David,” he whispered to himself.“Perhaps I should have done this thing long ago.”He was sorry the idea had not come into his mind in the days before his daughter Louise had been born and thought that surely now when he had erected a pile of burning sticks in some lonely place in the woods and had offered the body of a lamb as a burnt offering, God would appear to him and give him a message."
"他越是想及此事，就越是想到大卫；他那狂热的自爱之情便被忘记了大半。“这孩子该开始考虑进社会了，上帝的神示也会有些与他相关的。”他打定主意，“上帝必将为他指明一条道路。他一定会告诉我大卫将如何立足于世，还有他将何时开始人生的征途。这么看，这个孩子在场就是正确的。如果我够幸运，上帝的天使应当会出现，大卫就能看到上帝向凡人神示的美景和光荣了。这也必将使他成为一个真正的圣徒。”","More and more as he thought of the matter, he thought also of David and his passionate self-love was partially forgotten.“It is time for the boy to begin thinking of going out into the world and the message will be one concerning him,” he decided.“God will make a pathway for him.He will tell me what place David is to take in life and when he shall set out on his journey.It is right that the boy should be there.If I am fortunate and an angel of God should appear, David will see the beauty and glory of God made manifest to man.It will make a true man of God of him also.”"
"杰西同大卫一直沉默地沿路赶着车，直到他们来到那次杰西向上帝恳求并吓坏大卫的地方。这天早晨，阳光明媚，天气宜人，可现在，冷风开始吹了，乌云遮住了太阳。当大卫看见这个他们曾来过的地方时，他开始害怕得发抖。他们停在桥旁，溪水穿过树林顺流而下。他想要跳出马车逃走。","In silence Jesse and David drove along the road until they came to that place where Jesse had once before appealed to God and had frightened his grandson.The morning had been bright and cheerful, but a cold wind now began to blow and clouds hid the sun.When David saw the place to which they had come he began to tremble with fright, and when they stopped by the bridge where the creek came down from among the trees, he wanted to spring out of the phaeton and run away."
"他脑子里闪过了无数逃跑的计划，可当杰西停下马车，爬过篱笆，进入树林的时候，他还是跟了上去。“害怕是件很傻的事情。什么事也不会发生。”他抱着小羊羔，边走边对自己说。他手里紧紧抓着的这只无助的小动物身上的某种东西给了他勇气。他能感觉到它快速的心跳，这倒让他的心跳不那么剧烈了。当他在后面迅速地跟着外祖父往前走的时候，他解开了那条将羊羔四条腿绑在一起的绳子。“如果有事发生，我们就一起逃。”他想着。","A dozen plans for escape ran through David’s head, but when Jesse stopped the horse and climbed over the fence into the wood, he followed.“It is foolish to be afraid.Nothing will happen,” he told himself as he went along with the lamb in his arms.There was something in the helplessness of the little animal held so tightly in his arms that gave him courage.He could feel the rapid beating of the beast’s heart and that made his own heart beat less rapidly.As he walked swiftly along behind his grandfather, he untied the string with which the four legs of the lamb were fastened together.“If anything happens we will run away together,” he thought."
"他们沿着公路一直走了很久，到了树林里，杰西停在树木间的一块空地上，那里有一片四周长满低矮灌木丛的开阔地，从小溪边一直延伸过来。他依然一言不发，却立即开始堆高高的干柴堆，一会儿又点了火。孩子抱着小羊坐在地上。他的想象力使得老人的每个动作都别有意义，于是，他越来越感到害怕。“我必须将羊羔的血洒到大卫的头上。”杰西咕哝着。此时，柴火堆已经开始熊熊燃烧。他从口袋里拿出一把长长的匕首，然后转过身，快速穿过空地，朝大卫走过去。","In the woods, after they had gone a long way from the road, Jesse stopped in an opening among the trees where a clearing, overgrown with small bushes, ran up from the creek.He was still silent but began at once to erect a heap of dry sticks which he presently set afire.The boy sat on the ground with the lamb in his arms.His imagination began to invest every movement of the old man with significance and he became every moment more afraid.“I must put the blood of the lamb on the head of the boy,” Jesse muttered when the sticks had begun to blaze greedily, and taking a long knife from his pocket he turned and walked rapidly across the clearing toward David."
"恐惧占据了孩子的心灵。他就怕这个。他一动不动地坐了片刻，接着，他的身体变得僵硬，然后他一下子跳了起来。他的脸变得和这个羊羔的羊毛一样雪白。此时，羊羔突然发现松了绑，沿着山坡跑下去了。大卫也开始跑。恐惧使他箭步如飞。他疯一般地跳过低矮的灌木丛和圆木。他边跑边把手放进口袋里，拿出那个原本用来做弹弓射松鼠的树杈。当他来到那条清浅的、拍打着石头流淌而过的小溪时，他冲进水里，然后转身去看。当他看到外公手里紧握着那把长刀向他跑过来，他毫不迟疑地从水里选出一块石子放到弹弓上。他用尽全力将厚厚的皮筋往后一拉，石子嗖地飞了出去。石子正打在杰西的头上。他当时完全忘记了孩子，正全力追赶那只羊羔。他呻吟了一声，向前倒了下去，几乎就摔在了孩子的脚边上。当大卫看到他动也不动地躺在那里，显然是死了，他心中的恐惧剧增。这种恐惧几乎变成了一种失去理智的疯狂。","Terror seized upon the soul of the boy.He was sick with it.For a moment he sat perfectly still and then his body stiffened and he sprang to his feet.His face became as white as the fleece of the lamb that, now finding itself suddenly released, ran down the hill.David ran also.Fear made his feet fly.Over the low bushes and logs he leaped frantically.As he ran he put his hand into his pocket and took out the branched stick from which the sling for shooting squirrels was suspended.When he came to the creek that was shallow and splashed down over the stones, he dashed into the water and turned to look back, and when he saw his grandfather still running toward him with the long knife held tightly in his hand he did not hesitate, but reaching down, selected a stone and put it in the sling.With all his strength he drew back the heavy rubber bands and the stone whistled through the air.It hit Jesse, who had entirely forgotten the boy and was pursuing the lamb, squarely in the head.With a groan he pitched forward and fell almost at the boy’s feet.When David saw that he lay still and that he was apparently dead, his fright increased immeasurably.It became an insane panic."
"他大叫一声，转过身去，抽泣着穿过树林，跑掉了。“我不在乎——我杀了他，可我不在乎。”他呜咽着说。他不停地跑着，突然下决心再也不回本特利农场或是温斯堡镇了。“我杀了上帝的信徒，现在我自己已经成人，要出去闯世界了。”他坚定地说着，并停止了奔跑，转而快步地走上那条穿过田野和森林、沿着瓦英河蜿蜒向西的公路。","With a cry he turned and ran off through the woods weeping convulsively.“I don’t care—I killed him, but I don’t care,” he sobbed.As he ran on and on he decided suddenly that he would never go back again to the Bentley farms or to the town of Winesburg.“I have killed the man of God and now I will myself be a man and go into the world,” he said stoutly as he stopped running and walked rapidly down a road that followed the windings of Wine Creek as it ran through fields and forests into the west."
"杰西·本特利在溪边的地上艰难地挪动着。他呻吟着睁开双眼。很长时间，他静静地躺在地上，望着天空。最后，他站了起来，脑袋里一片混沌，对孩子的失踪一点儿也不吃惊。他在路边的一根圆木上坐了下来，开始谈起上帝。那就是人们能从他身上打听出来的一切。每当大卫的名字被提起，他都模模糊糊地看向天空，说是上帝的信使带走了那孩子。“这都是因为我太贪婪，想要荣誉啊。”他大声地说道。此外，关于此事，他再不多谈。","On the ground by the creek Jesse Bentley moved uneasily about.He groaned and opened his eyes.For a long time he lay perfectly still and looked at the sky.When at last he got to his feet, his mind was confused and he was not surprised by the boy’s disappearance.By the roadside he sat down on a log and began to talk about God.That is all they ever got out of him.Whenever David’s name was mentioned he looked vaguely at the sky and said that a messenger from God had taken the boy.“It happened because I was too greedy for glory,” he declared, and would have no more to say in the matter."
"第七章 一位有思想的人","Chapter 7 A Man Of Ideas"
"他同母亲住在一起。母亲是个头发花白、沉默寡言、面容奇特、面色如死灰一般的女人。他们住的房子坐落在一片小树林中，再过去就是温斯堡大街同瓦英河交汇的地方。他的名字叫乔·韦林，他的父亲是名律师，也是哥伦布市的州立法议员，曾是这个社区里有名望的人。乔本人身材矮小，性格也同镇上的其他人不一样。他就像一座沉睡多日的小型火山，突然就喷发火焰。不，也不像——他倒像一个被疯病控制了的人，由于疯病会突然来袭，将他推进莫名古怪的生理状况：翻着白眼，四肢抽搐，因此他在同伴中是个令人害怕的人。他就是这么个样子，只不过乔·韦林这种间歇性发作的毛病不是生理上的，而是精神上的。他被各种想法困扰，沉迷其中一个想法的苦痛让他无法自控。语言在他嘴里翻滚、踉跄而出。一种怪笑浮上他的双唇。他镶了金边的牙齿在太阳下闪闪发光。他猛抓住旁边的人就开始侃侃而谈。对于被抓的人，真是无处可逃。这位激动的倾诉者将热气喷到对方脸上，直望进人家的眼里；他用颤抖的食指戳着对方的胸膛，强迫对方认真听他说。","He lived with his mother, a grey, silent woman with a peculiar ashy complexion.The house in which they lived stood in a little grove of trees beyond where the main street of Winesburg crossed Wine Creek.His name was Joe Welling, and his father had been a man of some dignity in the community, a lawyer, and a member of the state legislature at Columbus.Joe himself was small of body and in his character unlike anyone else in town.He was like a tiny little volcano that lies silent for days and then suddenly spouts fire.No, he wasn’t like that—he was like a man who is subject to fits, one who walks among his fellow men inspiring fear because a fit may come upon him suddenly and blow him away into a strange uncanny physical state in which his eyes roll and his legs and arms jerk.He was like that, only that the visitation that descended upon Joe Welling was a mental and not a physical thing.He was beset by ideas and in the throes of one of his ideas was uncontrollable.Words rolled and tumbled from his mouth.A peculiar smile came upon his lips.The edges of his teeth that were tipped with gold glistened in the light.Pouncing upon a by-stander he began to talk.For the bystander there was no escape.The excited man breathed into his face, peered into his eyes, pounded upon his chest with a shaking forefinger, demanded, compelled attention."
"当时，美孚石油公司不像现在这样用大货车和机动卡车将油送到消费者手中，而是运到杂货零售商、五金店和其他诸如此类的店里。乔便是美孚公司在温斯堡和沿着那条穿过该城的铁路线前后几个镇的代理商。他收集账单、下订单，并做些其他的工作。这是他的立法委员父亲为他找来的工作。","In those days the Standard Oil Company did not deliver oil to the consumer in big wagons and motor trucks as it does now, but delivered instead to retail grocers, hardware stores, and the like.Joe was the Standard Oil agent in Winesburg and in several towns up and down the railroad that went through Winesburg.He collected bills, booked orders, and did other things.His father, the legislator, had secured the job for him."
"乔·韦林出入于温斯堡的那几家店铺——缄默、彬彬有礼，专心工作。人们暗中观察他，眼里隐藏着被警觉抑制着的消遣的神情。他们等着他发病，时刻准备好逃跑。尽管他的发作不足以造成什么伤害，可也不能一笑置之。那些时候让人难以承受。当被一个想法驾驭时，乔所向披靡。他的气场大得如巨人一般。这气场能压倒同他交谈的人，扫荡对方，扫荡一切，扫荡所有能听到他声音的人。","In and out of the stores of Winesburg went Joe Welling—silent, excessively polite, intent upon his business.Men watched him with eyes in which lurked amusement tempered by alarm.They were waiting for him to break forth, preparing to flee.Although the seizures that came upon him were harmless enough, they could not be laughed away.They were overwhelming.Astride an idea, Joe was overmastering.His personality became gigantic.It overrode the man to whom he talked, swept him away, swept all away, all who stood within sound of his voice."
"在西尔维斯特·韦斯特药店里站着四个人，他们正在谈论赛马。韦斯利·摩耶的那匹种马托尼·蒂普将参加六月份在俄亥俄州蒂芬举行的比赛。有谣言说那将是他职业生涯中最艰难的一战。据说那个了不起的骑师波普·吉尔斯会亲自到场。温斯堡的人都为托尼·蒂普的夺标捏了一把汗。","In Sylvester West’s Drug Store stood four men who were talking of horse racing.Wesley Moyer’s stallion, Tony Tip, was to race at the June meeting at Tiffin, Ohio, and there was a rumor that he would meet the stiffest competition of his career.It was said that Pop Geers, the great racing driver, would himself be there.A doubt of the success of Tony Tip hung heavy in the air of Winesburg."
"乔·韦林猛地推开纱门，走进了药店。他眼里带着一种奇怪的、专注的神情，他一把拽住埃德·托马斯。埃德认识波普·吉尔斯，而且他对托尼赢得比赛的看法值得重视。","Into the drug store came Joe Welling, brushing the screen door violently aside.With a strange absorbed light in his eyes he pounced upon Ed Thomas, he who knew Pop Geers and whose opinion of Tony Tip’s chances was worth considering."
"“瓦英河水涨起来了。”乔大叫着，那感觉就像是费迪皮迪兹带来了希腊人在马拉松中获胜的消息。他的手指在埃德宽阔的胸膛上敲鼓似的击打着。“在特鲁连桥那儿，水离桥面只有十一点五英寸了。”他接着说，语速飞快，齿缝间还发出些微的口哨音。其余四个人的脸上都浮现出无奈又厌恶的表情。","“The water is up in Wine Creek,” cried Joe Welling with the air of Pheidippides bringing news of the victory of the Greeks in the struggle at Marathon.His finger beat a tattoo upon Ed Thomas’s broad chest.“By Trunion bridge it is within eleven and a half inches of the flooring,” he went on, the words coming quickly and with a little whistling noise from between his teeth.An expression of helpless annoyance crept over the faces of the four."
"“我的数据绝对正确。请务必相信。我到思宁五金店买了把尺子。然后我回去量的。我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。你知道，十天没下雨了。起初，我也不知道怎么回事。各种想法在我脑袋里转得飞快。我想到了地下潜流和泉水。我的思维沉入地下去寻根探由。我在桥上席地而坐，挠了挠头。天上一片云也没有。到街上去，你就能看到。一片云都没有。现在也没有。哦，刚刚有一片云。我不想隐瞒事实。刚刚西边地平线附近有一片云，那云还没有一个人手掌大。”","“I have my facts correct.Depend upon that.I went to Sinnings’ Hardware Store and got a rule.Then I went back and measured.I could hardly believe my own eyes.It hasn’t rained you see for ten days.At first I didn’t know what to think.Thoughts rushed through my head.I thought of subterranean passages and springs.Down under the ground went my mind, delving about.I sat on the floor of the bridge and rubbed my head.There wasn’t a cloud in the sky, not one.Come out into the street and you’ll see.There wasn’t a cloud.There isn’t a cloud now.Yes, there was a cloud.I don’t want to keep back any facts.There was a cloud in the west down near the horizon, a cloud no bigger than a man’s hand.”"
"“可我不认为它同这件事有什么关系。就在那儿，你看。你明白我刚刚有多困惑了吧。”","“Not that I think that has anything to do with it.There it is, you see.You understand how puzzled I was.”"
"“接着，我突然有了灵感。我就笑起来了。你也会笑的。当然，梅迪纳县那边下过雨了。有趣吧，嗯？如果我们没火车，没邮局，没电报，我们还是会知道梅迪纳县那儿下过雨。那里是瓦英河的源头。人人都知道这件事。不起眼的老瓦英河给我们带来了这个消息。真有趣。我笑起来了。我觉得我该告诉你——有趣吧，嗯？”","“Then an idea came to me.I laughed.You’ll laugh, too.Of course it rained over in Medina County.That’s interesting, eh?If we had no trains, no mails, no telegraph, we would know that it rained over in Medina County.That’s where Wine Creek comes from.Everyone knows that.Little old Wine Creek brought us the news.That’s interesting.I laughed.I thought I’d tell you—it’s interesting, eh?”"
"乔·韦林转身走到门边。他从口袋里拿出一本书，站住了，手指快速划过其中一页。他又沉浸于自己身为美孚石油公司代理商的职责中了。“赫恩杂货店的煤油快断货了，我得去看看。”他喃喃说道，然后匆匆沿着街道走去，一路上向左右两边经过的人有礼貌地鞠躬致意。","Joe Welling turned and went out at the door.Taking a book from his pocket, he stopped and ran a finger down one of the pages.Again he was absorbed in his duties as agent of the Standard Oil Company.“Hern’s Grocery will be getting low on coal oil. I’ll see them,” he muttered, hurrying along the street, and bowing politely to the right and left at the people walking past."
"乔治·威拉德去《温斯堡鹰报》上班的时候，被乔·威林围住了。乔嫉妒这个男孩子。在他看来，他像是天生做记者的料。“这才是我该干的事。毫无疑问。”他大声地说，并在多尔蒂饭店前的人行道上拦住了乔治。他的双眼开始发光，食指也开始颤抖。“当然，我在美孚赚的钱更多。我只不过想告诉你，”他补充说，“我对你没有恶意，可你的工作本该是由我来做的。我可以用业余时间做这件工作。我可以到处跑，发现你从没见过的事情。“","When George Willard went to work for the Winesburg Eagle he was besieged by Joe Welling.Joe envied the boy.It seemed to him that he was meant by Nature to be a reporter on a newspaper.“It is what I should be doing, there is no doubt of that,” he declared, stopping George Willard on the side-walk before Daugherty’s Feed Store.His eyes began to glisten and his forefinger to tremble.“Of course I make more money with the Standard Oil Company and I’m only telling you,” he added.“I’ve got nothing against you but I should have your place.I could do the work at odd moments.Here and there I would run finding out things you’ll never see.”"
"乔越来越激动，把年轻的记者挤到了饭店前面。他像是陷入思考中了，紧张地翻着白眼，瘦长的手紧张地耙着头发。他微微笑起来，露出金牙，闪闪发光。“你把笔记本拿出来。”他命令道，“你口袋里随身带着一个小便笺本，对吧？我知道你是这么干的。嗯，你把这个写下来。我前几天想到的。让我们接受衰败。那什么是衰败？就是火。它烧焦木头和其他东西。你从没那么想过？当然没有。这儿的人行道，这个饭店，街那头的树林——都着火了。它们将被烧毁。你知道，衰败总是在发生。它不会停止。水和油漆也阻止不了。如果是铁的东西，会怎么样呢？会生锈，你明白吧。那也是火。整个世界都着火了。你就在报纸上这么写。用大号的字写‘全世界都着了火’。那会让他们尊敬你。他们会说你是个聪明的小伙子。我不在乎。我也不嫉妒你。我只是凭空想出这么个点子。我能让一张报纸热闹起来。你得承认这点。”","Becoming more excited Joe Welling crowded the young reporter against the front of the feed store.He appeared to be lost in thought, rolling his eyes about and running a thin nervous hand through his hair.A smile spread over his face and his gold teeth glittered.“You get out your note book,” he commanded.“You carry a little pad of paper in your pocket, don’t you?I knew you did.Well, you set this down.I thought of it the other day.Let’s take decay.Now what is decay?It’s fire.It burns up wood and other things.You never thought of that?Of course not.This sidewalk here and this feed store, the trees down the street there—they’re all on fire.They’re burning up.Decay you see is always going on.It doesn’t stop.Water and paint can’t stop it.If a thing is iron, then what?It rusts, you see.That’s fire, too.The world is on fire.Start your pieces in the paper that way.Just say in big letters ‘The World Is On Fire.’ That will make ‘em look up.They’ll say you’re a smart one.I don’t care.I don’t envy you.I just snatched that idea out of the air.I would make a newspaper hum.You got to admit that.”"
"乔·韦林飞快地转过身走掉了。他走了几步，停下来回头看看。“我会盯着你的。”他说，“我打算让你时不时地活泼一下。我应该自己开个报社，就该这么干。我会引起轰动的。人人都知道。”乔治·威拉德在《温斯堡鹰报》工作的一年期间，乔·韦林遭遇了四件事。他的母亲死了；他住进了新威拉德旅社；他恋爱了；他成立了温斯堡棒球俱乐部。","Turning quickly, Joe Welling walked rapidly away.When he had taken several steps he stopped and looked back.“I’m going to stick to you,” he said.“I’m going to make you a regular hummer.I should start a newspaper myself, that’s what I should do.I’d be a marvel.Everybody knows that.”When George Willard had been for a year on the Winesburg Eagle, four things happened to Joe Welling.His mother died, he came to live at the New Willard House, he became involved in a love affair, and he organized the Winesburg Baseball Club."
"乔成立棒球俱乐部是因为他想当教练，他担任此职位后便开始赢得镇上人们的尊重。“他真是个奇迹。”在他的队员横扫梅迪纳县队后，人们都这么说，“他让队员们齐心协力。你就看着他吧。”","Joe organized the baseball club because he wanted to be a coach and in that position he began to win the respect of his townsmen.“He is a wonder,” they declared after Joe’s team had whipped the team from Medina County.“He gets everybody working together.You just watch him.”"
"在棒球场上，乔·韦林站在第一垒旁边，全身兴奋地微微颤抖。所有的选手都不顾他们自己，而是紧紧地盯着他。这让对方的投球手十分困惑。","Upon the baseball field Joe Welling stood by first base, his whole body quivering with excitement.In spite of themselves all the players watched him closely.The opposing pitcher became confused."
"“现在！现在！现在！现在！”这个兴奋的人大声嚷着，“看着我！看着我！看着我的手指！看着我的手！看着我的脚！看着我的眼睛！让我们在这儿齐心协力！看着我！你们能在我身上看到所有比赛的动作。和我一起冲！和我一起冲！看着我！看着我！","“Now! Now! Now! Now!” shouted the excited man.“Watch me! Watch me! Watch my fingers! Watch my hands! Watch my feet! Watch my eyes! Let’s work together here! Watch me!In me you see all the movements of the game!Work with me! Work with me! Watch me! Watch me! Watch me!”"
"和温斯堡队的跑垒手们在一起的时候，乔·韦林变成了一个如有神助的人。在弄明白发生的事情之前，这些跑垒手紧紧盯着教练，跑过垒、前进、后退，好像被根无形的线牵着。对方球队的队员也盯着乔。他们都迷惑万分。他们盯了一会儿，紧接着，仿佛为了挣脱身上的魔咒，开始将球四处猛掷，就在那位教练一阵阵野兽般恶狠狠的叫喊声中，温斯堡的跑垒手们迅速跑到了本垒。","With runners of the Winesburg team on bases, Joe Welling became as one inspired.Before they knew what had come over them, the base runners were watching the man, edging off the bases, advancing, retreating, held as by an invisible cord.The players of the opposing team also watched Joe.They were fascinated.For a moment they watched and then, as though to break a spell that hung over them, they began hurling the ball wildly about, and amid a series of fierce animal-like cries from the coach, the runners of the Winesburg team scampered home."
"乔·韦林的恋爱让全温斯堡镇的人为之焦虑。开始的时候，人们窃窃私语，大摇其头。人们想笑，笑声却是勉强而不自然的。乔爱上了萨拉·金，一个身材瘦削，面容悲伤的姑娘。她同父亲、哥哥一起住在温斯堡公墓大门对面的一个砖头房子里。","Joe Welling’s love affair set the town of Winesburg on edge.When it began everyone whispered and shook his head.When people tried to laugh, the laughter was forced and unnatural.Joe fell in love with Sarah King, a lean, sad-looking woman who lived with her father and brother in a brick house that stood opposite the gate leading to the Winesburg Cemetery."
"父亲爱德华·金和哥哥汤姆·金在镇上都不受欢迎。人们说他们骄傲又危险。他们来自南部的某个地方，在特鲁连山峰上开了家苹果酒坊。据说汤姆·金在来温斯堡前杀过人。他二十七岁，骑着匹小灰马在镇上溜达。他还在唇上留着长长的一直盖到牙齿的黄色胡子，手里总拿着一根沉甸甸的、看上去意图不善的手杖。他有一次用手杖杀了一条狗。那只狗是鞋商温·波西家的，它站在路边摇着尾巴。汤姆·金一棍子下去就杀死了它。他因此而被捕，罚了十美金。老爱德华·金身材矮小，当他在街上经过的时候，发出一种奇怪而不悦的笑声。他大笑的时候总拿右手去挠左手肘。这个习惯使他的外套袖子几乎都磨破了。他沿着大街散步的时候，一边紧张地四处张望，一边大笑，看上去比他那沉默又面容凶狠的儿子更加危险。","The two Kings, Edward the father, and Tom the son, were not popular in Winesburg.They were called proud and dangerous.They had come to Winesburg from some place in the South and ran a cider mill on the Trunion Pike.Tom King was reported to have killed a man before he came to Winesburg.He was twenty-seven years old and rode about town on a grey pony.Also he had a long yellow mustache that dropped down over his teeth, and always carried a heavy, wicked-looking walking stick in his hand.Once he killed a dog with the stick.The dog belonged to Win Pawsey, the shoe merchant, and stood on the sidewalk wagging its tail.Tom King killed it with one blow.He was arrested and paid a fine of ten dollars.Old Edward King was small of stature and when he passed people in the street laughed a queer unmirthful laugh.When he laughed he scratched his left elbow with his right hand.The sleeve of his coat was almost worn through from the habit.As he walked along the street, looking nervously about and laughing, he seemed more dangerous than his silent, fierce-looking son."
"当萨拉·金开始和乔·韦林在夜晚出门散步的时候，人们惊恐地摇着头。她个子高但脸色苍白，眼睛下有黑眼圈。这对情侣在一起，看上去很荒唐。他们在树林里散步，乔说着话。乔热情迫切的山盟海誓从公墓墙边的阴影处传出来，或是从自来水厂通向贸易广场的山上那浓浓的树影中传来，然后在温斯堡的各个商店中流传。男人们站在新威拉德旅社的吧台边笑着谈论乔的求爱过程。笑过之后是一阵沉默。温斯堡棒球队在他的领导之下捷报频传，因此，全镇的人都开始尊敬他。他们感觉到了悲剧即将上演，他们等待着，神经质地大笑着。","When Sarah King began walking out in the evening with Joe Welling, people shook their heads in alarm.She was tall and pale and had dark rings under her eyes.The couple looked ridiculous together.Under the trees they walked and Joe talked.His passionate eager protestations of love, heard coming out of the darkness by the cemetery wall, or from the deep shadows of the trees on the hill that ran up to the Fair Grounds from Waterworks Pond, were repeated in the stores.Men stood by the bar in the New Willard House laughing and talking of Joe’s courtship.After the laughter came the silence.The Winesburg baseball team, under his management, was winning game after game, and the town had begun to respect him.Sensing a tragedy, they waited, laughing nervously."
"之后，一个周六的下午，在新威拉德旅社乔·卫林的房间里，全镇人期待已久、为之焦虑万分的事情终于发生了——乔同两位金先生见面了。乔治·威拉德是这场会面的见证人。经过是这样的：","Late on a Saturday afternoon the meeting between Joe Welling and the two Kings, the anticipation of which had set the town on edge, took place in Joe Welling’s room in the New Willard House.George Willard was a witness to the meeting.It came about in this way:"
"那位年轻的记者在晚饭后走进他房间的时候，看见汤姆·金和他的父亲坐在乔光线不明的房间里。汤姆拿着那枝沉甸甸的手杖，坐在靠门的地方。老爱德华·金在房里紧张地踱着步，右手挠着左手肘。走廊里空无一人，静悄悄的。","When the young reporter went to his room after the evening meal he saw Tom King and his father sitting in the half darkness in Joe’s room.The son had the heavy walking stick in his hand and sat near the door.Old Edward King walked nervously about, scratching his left elbow with his right hand.The hallways were empty and silent."
"乔治·威拉德回到自己的房间，在书桌旁坐下。他试图写些东西，可手抖得厉害，连笔都握不住。他也在房里紧张地踱起步来。他和镇上其他人一样，感觉很困惑，却不知如何是好。时间已经是晚上七点半，天色很快暗下来，乔·韦林沿着车站的月台朝旅社走来。他怀里抱着一束野草。尽管乔治因为害怕而全身发抖，他还是被此情此景逗乐了：那个敏捷的小个子抱着草，沿着月台快步小跑而来。","George Willard went to his own room and sat down at his desk.He tried to write but his hand trembled so that he could not hold the pen.He also walked nervously up and down.Like the rest of the town of Winesburg he was perplexed and knew not what to do.It was seven-thirty and fast growing dark when Joe Welling came along the station platform toward the New Willard House.In his arms he held a bundle of weeds and grasses.In spite of the terror that made his body shake, George Willard was amused at the sight of the small spry figure holding the grasses and half running along the platform."
"这位年轻的记者躲在乔·韦林同金家父子谈话的房间门外的走廊里，因害怕和焦虑发着抖。开始时传来一个誓言，老爱德华·金神经兮兮地咯咯笑了一阵，接着是一阵沉默。现在，乔突然发出尖锐而清晰的声音。乔治·威拉德开始笑了起来。他明白了。正如乔·韦林曾经横扫众人那样，如今他又开始用那滔滔不绝的言浪辞海使房里的两个人甘拜下风。在走廊里听着的那个人来回踱着步，惊奇得出了神。","Shaking with fright and anxiety, the young reporter lurked in the hallway outside the door of the room in which Joe Welling talked to the two Kings.There had been an oath, the nervous giggle of old Edward King, and then silence.Now the voice of Joe Welling, sharp and clear, broke forth.George Willard began to laugh.He understood.As he had swept all men before him, so now Joe Welling was carrying the two men in the room off their feet with a tidal wave of words.The listener in the hall walked up and down, lost in amazement."
"房间里，乔·韦林丝毫没有注意到汤姆·金的低声威胁。他沉浸在一个想法中，他关上了门，点亮了灯，将那捧杂草摊在地板上。“我这儿有些东西。”他严肃地宣布道，“我打算告诉乔治·威拉德这件事，让他就此给报纸写个报道。我很高兴你们在这儿。我真希望萨拉也在。我一直打算去你们的房子那儿告诉你们我的一些想法。非常有趣的想法。可萨拉不让我这么做。她说我们会吵起来的。那可真傻。”","Inside the room Joe Welling had paid no attention to the grumbled threat of Tom King.Absorbed in an idea he closed the door and, lighting a lamp, spread the handful of weeds and grasses upon the floor.“I’ve got something here,” he announced solemnly.“I was going to tell George Willard about it, let him make a piece out of it for the paper.I’m glad you’re here.I wish Sarah were here also.I’ve been going to come to your house and tell you of some of my ideas.They’re interesting.Sarah wouldn’t let me.She said we’d quarrel.That’s foolish.”"
"乔在两个困惑不解的人面前快步踱着，开始解释。“你们现在不是犯了错吗？”他大叫道，“这是件大事。”他的声音因为激动而尖锐起来。“你们跟着我，你们会感兴趣的。我知道你们会的。假设这个——假设所有的小麦、玉米、燕麦、豆子、土豆都被某种神奇的力量给一扫而光了。现在，我们在这儿，你们知道，在这个县里。在我们周围建有一道高高的护栏。我们就假设这样。没人能越过护栏，全世界的果实都被毁灭了，只剩下这些野生的东西，这些草。我们会就此完蛋吗？我问你们。我们会就此完蛋吗？”汤姆·金又生气地嘟囔着；房间里一时间陷入沉寂。接着，乔再次单刀直入，开始了他的鸿篇大论。“情况会变得艰难一阵子。我承认。我得承认。不会回避。我们必定会陷入困境。不止一个胖肚子要瘪下去。可这都不会把我们难倒。我必须说不会的。”","Running up and down before the two perplexed men, Joe Welling began to explain.“Don’t you make a mistake now,” he cried.“This is something big.”His voice was shrill with excitement.“You just follow me, you’ll be interested.I know you will.Suppose this—suppose all of the wheat, the corn, the oats, the peas, the potatoes, were all by some miracle swept away.Now here we are, you see, in this county.There is a high fence built all around us.We’ll suppose that.No one can get over the fence and all the fruits of the earth are destroyed, nothing left but these wild things, these grasses.Would we be done for?I ask you that.Would we be done for?”Again Tom King growled and for a moment there was silence in the room.Then again Joe plunged into the exposition of his idea.“Things would go hard for a time.I admit that.I’ve got to admit that.No getting around it.We’d be hard put to it.More than one fat stomach would cave in.But they couldn’t down us.I should say not.”"
"汤姆·金敦厚地大笑起来，爱德华·金那颤抖的、神经质的笑声也响彻整座房子。乔·韦林急忙接着往下说。“你们知道，我们得要开始培育新的蔬菜和果实。很快，我们就能重新获得失去的一切。注意，我并不是说新的东西会和旧东西一样。它们会不同。也许会更好，也许不会。很有趣，不是吗？你们可以想想看。这能让你们的思维转起来，不是吗？”","Tom King laughed good naturedly and the shivery, nervous laugh of Edward King rang through the house.Joe Welling hurried on.“We’d begin, you see, to breed up new vegetables and fruits.Soon we’d regain all we had lost.Mind, I don’t say the new things would be the same as the old.They wouldn’t.Maybe they’d be better, maybe not so good.That’s interesting, eh?You can think about that.It starts your mind working, now don’t it?”"
"房间里一片沉默，紧接着，老爱德华·金又神经兮兮地大笑起来。“我就说吧，我真希望萨拉在这儿。”乔·韦林大声说道，“我们到你们的房子那儿去。我想告诉她这件事。”","In the room there was silence and then again old Edward King laughed nervously.“Say, I wish Sarah was here,” cried Joe Welling.“Let’s go up to your house.I want to tell her of this.”"
"房间里传出一阵椅子摩擦的声音。就在那时，乔治·威拉德退回了自己的房间。从窗户探身望出去，他看见乔·韦林同金家父子沿着大街走着。汤姆·金不得不迈开大步跟上那个小个子男人。他一边大步走，一边倾身过去，倾听着——专注又兴味盎然。乔·韦林又在兴奋地说着话。“现在，拿着马利筋。”他大声说，“拿它或许能干很多事，对吧？简直难以相信。我想让你们想想看。我想让你们俩想想看。将会有个新的蔬菜王国，你们知道的。很有趣吧？这是个好点子。等你们见到萨拉，她也会明白这个想法的。她会感兴趣的。她一直对各种想法都感兴趣。没有比她更聪明的姑娘了，那么，你们能吗？当然，你们办不到。你们知道的。”","There was a scraping of chairs in the room.It was then that George Willard retreated to his own room.Leaning out at the window he saw Joe Welling going along the street with the two Kings.Tom King was forced to take extraordinary long strides to keep pace with the little man.As he strode along, he leaned over, listening—absorbed, fascinated.Joe Welling again talked excitedly.“Take milkweed now,” he cried.“A lot might be done with milkweed, eh?It’s almost unbelievable.I want you to think about it.I want you two to think about it.There would be a new vegetable kingdom you see.It’s interesting, eh?It’s an idea.Wait till you see Sarah, she’ll get the idea.She’ll be interested.Sarah is always interested in ideas.You can’t be too smart for Sarah, now can you?Of course you can’t.You know that.”"
"第八章 冒险","Chapter 8 Adventure"
"在乔治·威拉德还只是个小男孩的时候，艾丽斯·欣德曼是个27岁的女子，一直都住在温斯堡镇。她在温尼干货店工作，同她再嫁了的妈妈住在一起。","Alice Hindman, a woman of twenty-seven when George Willard was a mere boy, had lived in Winesburg all her life.She clerked in Winney’s Dry Goods Store and lived with her mother, who had married a second husband."
"艾丽斯的继父是马车油漆工，嗜酒如命。他的故事很奇怪。值得哪天来大书特书一番。","Alice’s step-father was a carriage painter, and given to drink.His story is an odd one.It will be worth telling some day."
"二十七岁时的艾丽斯身材高挑，有些纤瘦。她的头很大，看起来和身体不大协调。她的肩膀微微有些驼；她的眼睛和头发都是棕色的。她非常文静，可在平静的外表下一直有种躁动。","At twenty-seven Alice was tall and somewhat slight.Her head was large and overshadowed her body.Her shoulders were a little stooped and her hair and eyes brown.She was very quiet but beneath a placid exterior a continual ferment went on."
"在她十六岁，还没到店里工作的时候，艾丽斯曾经同一个年轻人相爱过。那位年轻人名叫内德·柯里，比艾丽斯年长些。他同乔治·威拉德一样，受雇于《温斯堡鹰报》，有很长一段时间，他几乎每晚都去同艾丽斯见面。两人一起在树下走过镇上的街道，谈起今后共同的生活。艾丽斯在当时是个非常漂亮的姑娘，内德·柯里用双臂抱着她亲吻。他变得兴奋起来，说了些原先没打算说的话。而艾丽斯则因为渴望有些美好的东西走进自己相当狭窄的生活而动了情，也越来越激动。她也说着。她生活的外壳，以及那层与生俱来的怯懦和保守都被撕破了，她让自己沉溺在爱情的洪流中。在她十六岁的那个深秋，内德·柯里离开此地，前往克利夫兰，想在城里的一家报社谋求职位，以期借此出人头地。艾丽斯想同他一起去。她用颤抖的声音告诉他自己的想法。“我会去工作，你也可以工作。”她说，“我不想拖累你，使你花些不必要的钱，让你的前途受阻。现在，你不必娶我。我们可以不结婚就在一起。即使我们住在一间房里，也没人会说什么的。在城市里，没人认识我们，人们也不会注意我们。”","When she was a girl of sixteen and before she began to work in the store, Alice had an affair with a young man.The young man, named Ned Currie, was older than Alice.He, like George Willard, was employed on the Winesburg Eagle and for a long time he went to see Alice almost every evening.Together the two walked under the trees through the streets of the town and talked of what they would do with their lives.Alice was then a very pretty girl and Ned Currie took her into his arms and kissed her.He became excited and said things he did not intend to say and Alice, betrayed by her desire to have something beautiful come into her rather narrow life, also grew excited.She also talked.The outer crust of her life, all of her natural diffidence and reserve, was torn away and she gave herself over to the emotions of love.When, late in the fall of her sixteenth year, Ned Currie went away to Cleveland where he hoped to get a place on a city newspaper and rise in the world, she wanted to go with him.With a trembling voice she told him what was in her mind.“I will work and you can work,” she said.“I do not want to harness you to a needless expense that will prevent your making progress.Don’t marry me now.We will get along without that and we can be together.Even though we live in the same house no one will say anything.In the city we will be unknown and people will pay no attention to us.”"
"内德·柯里被这位心上人的决心和轻率弄糊涂了，但也深受感动。他曾经想过让这个姑娘做他的情人，可又改变了主意。他想要保护并关爱她。“你不知道你在说些什么。”他严厉地说，“有一点你可以确定，我不会让你这么做的。我一找到份工作就会回来。现在，你还是得留在这里。这才是我们唯一能做的。”","Ned Currie was puzzled by the determination and abandon of his sweetheart and was also deeply touched.He had wanted the girl to become his mistress but changed his mind.He wanted to protect and care for her.“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said sharply; “you may be sure I’ll let you do no such thing.As soon as I get a good job I’ll come back.For the present you’ll have to stay here.It’s the only thing we can do.”"
"在他离开温斯堡前往城市，开始新生活的前一夜，内德·柯里去找艾丽斯。他们在街上散了一个小时的步，然后在韦斯利·莫耶车行租了一辆马车到乡间去兜风。月亮升上来，他们无法言语，陷入了沉默。在悲伤中，这位年轻人忘记了自己之前曾下定的决心——有关自己对这姑娘的行为的。他们从马车里下来，在瓦英河边长长的草地上找了一个地方，在昏暗的光线里，成了情人。午夜时分，他们回到镇上，两人都很开心。仿佛对他们而言，将来无论发生什么，都难以将刚才所经历的奇妙和美好抹煞。“现在，我们必须相依为命了。无论发生什么，我们必须这么做。”内德在她父亲门前同她分手时，这么说道。","On the evening before he left Winesburg to take up his new life in the city, Ned Currie went to call on Alice.They walked about through the streets for an hour and then got a rig from Wesley Moyer’s livery and went for a drive in the country.The moon came up and they found themselves unable to talk.In his sadness the young man forgot the resolutions he had made regarding his conduct with the girl.They got out of the buggy at a place where a long meadow ran down to the bank of Wine Creek and there in the dim light became lovers.When at midnight they returned to town they were both glad.It did not seem to them that anything that could happen in the future could blot out the wonder and beauty of the thing that had happened.“Now we will have to stick to each other, whatever happens we will have to do that,” Ned Currie said as he left the girl at her father’s door."
"年轻的记者没能在克利夫兰的报业觅到一席之地，便往西去了芝加哥。他一度感到孤独，几乎每天给艾丽斯写信。后来，他被城市的生活迷住了。他开始结交朋友，并在生活中寻找到了新的乐趣。在芝加哥，他住在一家有几位女士的房子里。其中一位吸引住了他，他便将在温斯堡的艾丽斯抛在了脑后。一年后，他不再写信，只有在极少数的时候，当他感到孤独或者在城市的某个公园里看到月光洒满草地，就像那晚在瓦英河边的草地上一样，他才会想起她。","The young newspaper man did not succeed in getting a place on a Cleveland paper and went west to Chicago.For a time he was lonely and wrote to Alice almost every day.Then he was caught up by the life of the city; he began to make friends and found new interests in life.In Chicago he boarded at a house where there were several women.One of them attracted his attention and he forgot Alice in Winesburg.At the end of a year he had stopped writing letters, and only once in a long time, when he was lonely or when he went into one of the city parks and saw the moon shining on the grass as it had shone that night on the meadow by Wine Creek, did he think of her at all."
"在温斯堡，这个经历过爱情的女孩变成了女人。在她二十二岁的时候，她的父亲——马具维修店的老板——突然过世了。这个马具商人是个老兵，过了几个月，他的妻子收到了一笔遗孀抚恤金。她用第一笔钱买了一架织布机，成了一位地毯织工，而艾丽斯也在温尼的店里找了份工作。许多年过去了，什么也无法让她相信内德·柯里最后不会再回来找她了。","In Winesburg the girl who had been loved grew to be a woman.When she was twenty-two years old her father, who owned a harness repair shop, died suddenly.The harness maker was an old soldier, and after a few months his wife received a widow’s pension.She used the first money she got to buy a loom and became a weaver of carpets, and Alice got a place in Winney’s store.For a number of years nothing could have induced her to believe that Ned Currie would not in the end return to her."
"她乐于工作，因为平日店里的辛劳工作能让她的等待变得不那么漫长和枯燥。她开始存钱，想着等她存到两三百美元的时候，就能到城市里去找她的情人，试试看她的出现能否赢回他的爱情。","She was glad to be employed because the daily round of toil in the store made the time of waiting seem less long and uninteresting.She began to save money, thinking that when she had saved two or three hundred dollars she would follow her lover to the city and try if her presence would not win back his affections."
"艾丽斯并不为那晚在月光下的野地里发生的事情责怪过内德·柯里，但觉得自己再不能嫁给其他人了。在她看来，在仍觉得自己只属于耐德的时候委身他人似乎是荒谬的。当其他的年轻人向她示好的时候，她不为所动。“我是他的妻子，无论他回不回来都是。”她轻声对自己说。虽然她决心自立，可也不能理解现代女性逐渐增强的自主自爱、为自己而活的观点。","Alice did not blame Ned Currie for what had happened in the moonlight in the field, but felt that she could never marry another man.To her the thought of giving to another what she still felt could belong only to Ned seemed monstrous.When other young men tried to attract her attention she would have nothing to do with them.“I am his wife and shall remain his wife whether he comes back or not,” she whispered to herself, and for all of her willingness to support herself could not have understood the growing modern idea of a woman’s owning herself and giving and taking for her own ends in life."
"艾丽斯在干货店从早上八点干到晚上六点，每周有三个晚上在店里从七点守到九点。随着时光流逝，她变得越来越孤独，于是开始尝试孤独的人都会做的事情。她每晚回到楼上自己的房间时就跪在地板上祈祷，将想对情人说的事情低声倾诉在祈祷里。她开始依恋无生命的东西；因为她将自己房里的家具视为几有，所以她无法忍受任何人触碰。她为了某个目的而开始的存钱计划，在放弃了去城市里找内德·柯里的打算之后，仍在进行着。它变成了一个固定的习惯，即使是当她需要新衣服的时候，她也没有动过那些钱。有时，在下雨的午后，在店里，她会拿出银行存折，打开来就放在面前，好几个小时都不切实际地幻想着自己攒够了钱，光是利息就能养活她自己和将来的丈夫。","Alice worked in the dry goods store from eight in the morning until six at night and on three evenings a week went back to the store to stay from seven until nine.As time passed and she became more and more lonely she began to practice the devices common to lonely people.When at night she went upstairs into her own room she knelt on the floor to pray and in her prayers whispered things she wanted to say to her lover.She became attached to inanimate objects, and because it was her own, could not bare to have anyone touch the furniture of her room.The trick of saving money, begun for a purpose, was carried on after the scheme of going to the city to find Ned Currie had been given up.It became a fixed habit, and when she needed new clothes she did not get them.Sometimes on rainy afternoons in the store she got out her bank book and, letting it lie open before her, spent hours dreaming impossible dreams of saving money enough so that the interest would support both herself and her future husband."
"“内德总爱四处游玩。”她想,“我会给他这个机会。哪天我们结婚的时候，我就能攒够我们两个人的钱，我们会很富有。我们就能一起去环游世界。”","“Ned always liked to travel about,” she thought.“I’ll give him the chance.Some day when we are married and I can save both his money and my own, we will be rich.Then we can travel together all over the world.”"
"艾丽斯在干货店里等待并幻想着她的情人的归来，时间从星期转瞬成了月，月又转瞬成了年。她的老板是个头发灰白的老人，戴着假牙，留着一直盖过嘴的稀薄的灰白胡须，也不爱说话。有时，在下雨天和冬季，大街上暴风雨肆虐，很久都没有一个顾客光临。艾丽斯就把货物摆了又摆。她站在前门的窗边，那里可以看到空无一人的街道，想起无数个夜晚当她和内德在一起散步时，他说过的话。“我们现在只有相依为命了。”这句话反反复复地在这位逐渐成熟的女人的心中回响。泪水涌上了她的眼眶。有时，当她的老板出了门，她独自守店的时候，她就将头伏在柜台上抹眼泪。“噢，内德，我在等你。”她一遍又一遍地低声说着。可是，那种他可能永远不会回来的恐惧日益蔓延，在她心里越变越强烈。","In the dry goods store weeks ran into months and months into years as Alice waited and dreamed of her lover’s return.Her employer, a grey old man with false teeth and a thin grey mustache that drooped down over his mouth, was not given to conversation, and sometimes, on rainy days and the winter when a storm raged in Main Street, long hours passed when no customers came in.Alice arranged and rearranged the stock.She stood near the front window where she could look down the deserted street and thought of the evenings when she had walked with Ned Currie and of what he had said.“We will have to stick to each other now.”The words echoed and reechoed through the mind of the maturing woman.Tears came into her eyes.Sometimes when her employer had gone out and she was alone in the store she put her head on the counter and wept.“Oh, Ned, I am waiting,” she whispered over and over, and all the time the creeping fear that he would never come back grew stronger within her."
"春天的雨季已经结束而漫长炎热的夏天尚未到来之时，温斯堡周边的乡村是令人心怡的。整座小镇座落在一马平川的的田野中央，但越过田野却是一片片赏心悦目的树林。在密林之中有许多小小的隐秘的角落，那地方很安静，情侣们周日下午常去那里坐。他们可以从树林中眺望田野，看见农夫们在谷仓边工作，或是人们驾车在马路上奔驰。小镇的钟声敲响，不时有火车经过，远看就像一个玩具。","In the spring when the rains have passed and before the long hot days of summer have come, the country about Winesburg is delightful.The town lies in the midst of open fields, but beyond the fields are pleasant patches of woodlands.In the wooded places are many little cloistered nooks, quiet places where lovers go to sit on Sunday afternoons.Through the trees they look out across the fields and see farmers at work about the barns or people driving up and down on the roads.In the town bells ring and occasionally a train passes, looking like a toy thing in the distance."
"内德·柯里走后的几年里，艾丽斯没在周日同其他的年轻人去过那片树林。但是，他离开两三年后，某日当她的寂寞无法排解之时，她便穿上最好的衣服出门去。她找到一小处能看到小镇和一大片农田的栖身地，坐下来。韶华逝去和空等一场的恐惧占据了她的身心。她再坐不住了，便站了起来。当她立在那里眺望农田的时候，某种东西，或许是四季轮回、生命无止尽的想法使她更加留恋过去。她意识到对她而言，青春的美丽和鲜活已经成为过去，不禁害怕得簌簌发抖。第一次，她感到被欺骗了。她并没责怪内德·柯里，也不知道有什么可责怪的。悲伤漫过心头。她双膝跪倒，试着祈祷，不过，从她唇间发出的是抗议之辞而非祷告词。“幸福不会降临到我身上。我永不会找到幸福。我为什么对自己说谎呢？”她哭着，一种奇怪的解脱感随之而来；这是她第一次大胆地试着去面对恐惧，尽管恐惧已经成为了她每日生活的一部分。","For several years after Ned Currie went away Alice did not go into the wood with the other young people on Sunday, but one day after he had been gone for two or three years and when her loneliness seemed unbearable, she put on her best dress and set out.Finding a little sheltered place from which she could see the town and a long stretch of the fields, she sat down.Fear of age and ineffectuality took possession of her.She could not sit still, and arose.As she stood looking out over the land something, perhaps the thought of never ceasing life as it expresses itself in the flow of the seasons, fixed her mind on the passing years.With a shiver of dread, she realized that for her the beauty and freshness of youth had passed.For the first time she felt that she had been cheated.She did not blame Ned Currie and did not know what to blame.Sadness swept over her.Dropping to her knees, she tried to pray, but instead of prayers words of protest came to her lips.“It is not going to come to me.I will never find happiness.Why do I tell myself lies?” she cried, and an odd sense of relief came with this, her first bold attempt to face the fear that had become a part of her everyday life."
"艾丽斯·欣德曼二十五岁那年，有两件事情发生，打乱了她乏味又平淡的生活。她的妈妈嫁给了温斯堡的马车油漆工布什·米尔顿；她自己成为了温斯堡卫理教的成员。艾丽斯入教是因为已经被自己生活处境中的孤独吓坏了。她妈妈的再婚进一步加深了她的孤独。“我变得又老又古怪。如果内德回来，也不会要我了。他所在的那个城市里，男人们都永远是年轻的。有那么多的事情发生，他们都没有时间变老。”她微微冷笑着自言自语道，下定决心与人亲近。每周四晚，当店里打烊后，她便去参加教堂地下室的祷告会；周日晚则参加一个名为爱普华斯团组织的集会。","In the year when Alice Hindman became twenty-five two things happened to disturb the dull uneventfulness of her days.Her mother married Bush Milton, the carriage painter of Winesburg, and she herself became a member of the Winesburg Methodist Church.Alice joined the church because she had become frightened by the loneliness of her position in life.Her mother’s second marriage had emphasized her isolation.“I am becoming old and queer.If Ned comes he will not want me.In the city where he is living men are perpetually young.There is so much going on that they do not have time to grow old,” she told herself with a grim little smile, and went resolutely about the business of becoming acquainted with people.Every Thursday evening when the store had closed she went to a prayer meeting in the basement of the church and on Sunday evening attended a meeting of an organization called The Epworth League."
"当威尔·赫尔利——一位在药店工作的中年人，同时也是她的教友——提出陪她散步回家的时候，她没有拒绝。“当然我不会真的让他常同我在一起，可是如果他偶尔来看我一次也无伤大雅。”她这样告诉自己，仍打定主意要忠于内德·柯里。","When Will Hurley, a middle-aged man who clerked in a drug store and who also belonged to the church, offered to walk home with her she did not protest.“Of course I will not let him make a practice of being with me, but if he comes to see me once in a long time there can be no harm in that,” she told herself, still determined in her loyalty to Ned Currie."
"她对发生着的事情并不了解，可凭着日益增长的决心，她开始如履薄冰地尝试着在生活中寻找一个新的支点。她同那位药店店员并肩沉默地走着，但有时当他们漠然地在黑暗中行进的时候，她便伸出手轻轻地触摸他外衣的褶皱。当他将她送至母亲家的房门前时，她并不进去，反而在门边站了一会儿。她想叫住那个药店职员，让他同自己在门前走廊上的黑暗处坐上一会儿，可又害怕他不能理解。“他不是我想要的那个人，”她对自己说，“我只是不想总一个人。如果我不小心，会变得不习惯与人相处。”","Without realizing what was happening, Alice was trying feebly at first, but with growing determination, to get a new hold upon life.Beside the drug clerk she walked in silence, but sometimes in the darkness as they went stolidly along she put out her hand and touched softly the folds of his coat.When he left her at the gate before her mother’s house she did not go indoors, but stood for a moment by the door.She wanted to call to the drug clerk, to ask him to sit with her in the darkness on the porch before the house, but was afraid he would not understand.“It is not him that I want,” she told herself; “I want to avoid being so much alone.If I am not careful I will grow unaccustomed to being with people.”"
"在她二十七岁的那个早秋，一种狂热的躁动占据了艾丽斯的心头。她不能忍受同那个药店职员作伴，于是当他傍晚来同她散步时，她便打发走他了。她的思维变得极为活跃。她因在店里长时间站在柜台后面而感到厌倦，可回家爬上床后又无法入睡。她睁着双眼凝视着黑夜。她的想象便如同酣眠后醒来的孩子一般，在这房间里四处移动。她内心深处有种东西不想被幻想欺骗，并要求从生活里找到某种确定的答案。","During the early fall of her twenty-seventh year a passionate restlessness took possession of Alice.She could not bear to be in the company of the drug clerk, and when, in the evening, he came to walk with her she sent him away.Her mind became intensely active and when, weary from the long hours of standing behind the counter in the store, she went home and crawled into bed, she could not sleep.With staring eyes she looked into the darkness.Her imagination, like a child awakened from long sleep, played about the room.Deep within her there was something that would not be cheated by phantasies and that demanded some definite answer from life."
"她拿过一个枕头紧紧抱在怀里。她从床上下来，将毯子整理了一下，在黑暗中看上去就像是一个人影躺在被褥间，然后自己跪在床边，抚摸着它，吟歌一般轻声地一遍又一遍地低语着。“为什么没什么事发生？为什么我被一个人留在这里？”她抱怨着。虽然她还会时常想起内德·柯里，可也已经不再指望他了。她的欲望变得模糊。她不再需要内德或是其他的男人。她希望被爱，希望有什么来回应心里越来越强烈的呼唤。","Alice took a pillow into her arms and held it tightly against her breasts.Getting out of bed, she arranged a blanket so that in the darkness it looked like a form lying between the sheets and, kneeling beside the bed, she caressed it, whispering words over and over, like a refrain.“Why doesn’t something happen?Why am I left here alone?” she muttered.Although she sometimes thought of Ned Currie, she no longer depended on him.Her desire had grown vague.She did not want Ned Currie or any other man.She wanted to be loved, to have something answer the call that was growing louder and louder within her."
"后来，在一个雨夜，艾丽斯有了一次奇遇。那使她害怕又困惑。九点，她从店里回家后发现房子里没有人。布什·米尔顿去了镇上，她的妈妈在一个邻居家。艾丽斯上楼回到自己的房间，在黑暗中脱掉衣服。她在窗边站了一会儿，听着雨点打在玻璃上，接着，一种奇怪的欲望占据了她。她没有停下来想自己要做什么就跑下了楼，穿过黑暗的房子，冲到雨里去了。当她站在门前小小的草地上，感受着冰冷的雨水打在身体上，一种想要在街头裸奔的疯狂欲望占据了她的身心。　","And then one night when it rained Alice had an adventure.It frightened and confused her.She had come home from the store at nine and found the house empty.Bush Milton had gone off to town and her mother to the house of a neighbor.Alice went upstairs to her room and undressed in the darkness.For a moment she stood by the window hearing the rain beat against the glass and then a strange desire took possession of her.Without stopping to think of what she intended to do, she ran downstairs through the dark house and out into the rain.As she stood on the little grass plot before the house and felt the cold rain on her body a mad desire to run naked through the streets took possession of her."
"她觉得雨水会在她的身体上产生一些富于创意的、奇妙的作用。很多年来，她都没有感到那样充满青春和勇气。她想要跳跃和奔跑，想大声叫喊，去找另一个孤独的人并拥抱他。房前的砖砌人行道上，有个男人跌跌撞撞地往家走。艾丽斯开始奔跑。她心里充满了一种狂乱又绝望的情绪。“我干嘛要在乎那是谁。他独自一人，我要去找他。”她暗自想着，轻声呼唤着，并没有停下来想这疯狂之举可能产生的结果。“等一下！”她叫道，“别走！无论你是谁，都要等一下！”","She thought that the rain would have some creative and wonderful effect on her body.Not for years had she felt so full of youth and courage.She wanted to leap and run, to cry out, to find some other lonely human and embrace him.On the brick sidewalk before the house a man stumbled homeward.Alice started to run.A wild, desperate mood took possession of her.“What do I care who it is.He is alone, and I will go to him,” she thought; and then without stopping to consider the possible result of her madness, called softly.“Wait!” she cried.“Don’t go away.Whoever you are, you must wait.”"
"人行道上的那个人停下来，站在那里听着。他是个老头，有些聋。他将手放在嘴边，喊道，“什么？说什么？”他大声问。","The man on the sidewalk stopped and stood listening.He was an old man and somewhat deaf.Putting his hand to his mouth, he shouted.“What? What say?” he called."
"艾丽斯倒在地上，躺着颤抖。想到刚才自己的行为，艾丽斯惊恐万分，以至于当那个老人继续往前走的时候，她也不敢站起来，而是匍匐着爬过草地，回到房子里。她回到自己的房间后，栓上了门，拉过梳妆台顶住门背。她全身就像冻着了似的直发抖；她的双手抖得厉害，连睡裙也穿不上。等她上了床，她将脸埋在枕头里，伤心地呜呜哭起来。“我是怎么了？如果不小心，我就会做出些可怕的事来。”她想着，转过脸朝着墙，开始强迫自己勇敢地面对这个事实——即使是在温斯堡，很多人也必会孤独终老。","Alice dropped to the ground and lay trembling.She was so frightened at the thought of what she had done that when the man had gone on his way she did not dare get to her feet, but crawled on hands and knees through the grass to the house.When she got to her own room she bolted the door and drew her dressing table across the doorway.Her body shook as with a chill and her hands trembled so that she had difficulty getting into her nightdress.When she got into bed she buried her face in the pillow and wept broken-heartedly.“What is the matter with me?I will do something dreadful if I am not careful,” she thought, and turning her face to the wall, began trying to force herself to face bravely the fact that many people must live and die alone, even in Winesburg."
"第九章 可敬之处","Chapter 9 Respectability"
"如果你在城市里住过，并在夏日的午后去公园里散过步，你或许见过一种巨大、奇怪的猴子，眼睛下面的皮肤丑陋、松弛、无毛，下体一片鲜亮的紫红色，在铁笼子的角落里眨着眼睛。这种猴子真是种怪物。它那极致丑陋的外表却造就了一种反常美。孩子们站在笼子前面着迷不已，男人们带着一种恶心的表情转过身去，而女人们则会驻足一会儿，可能在试着回忆在她们认识的男人中，有哪个和这个东西有些微相似之处。","If you have lived in cities and have walked in the park on a summer afternoon, you have perhaps seen, blinking in a corner of his iron cage, a huge, grotesque kind of monkey, a creature with ugly, sagging, hairless skin below his eyes and a bright purple underbody.This monkey is a true monster.In the completeness of his ugliness he achieved a kind of perverted beauty.Children stopping before the cage are fascinated, men turn away with an air of disgust, and women linger for a moment, trying perhaps to remember which one of their male acquaintances the thing in some faint way resembles."
"如果你童年时曾在俄亥俄州的温斯堡住过，就会发现这个笼中野兽毫无神秘可言。“它长得就像沃什·威廉斯。”你就会这么说的，“当它坐在角落那儿的时候，看上去完全和老沃什在夏天晚上停止营业后坐在车站广场的草坪上一样。”","Had you been in the earlier years of your life a citizen of the village of Winesburg, Ohio, there would have been for you no mystery in regard to the beast in his cage.“It is like Wash Williams,” you would have said.“As he sits in the corner there, the beast is exactly like old Wash sitting on the grass in the station yard on a summer evening after he has closed his office for the night.”"
"沃什·威廉斯，温斯堡的电报接线员，是镇上最丑的人。他粗腰、细脖子、两腿瘦弱。他很脏。有关他的一切都不干净。甚至连他的眼白看上去都是脏的。","Wash Williams, the telegraph operator of Winesburg, was the ugliest thing in town.His girth was immense, his neck thin, his legs feeble.He was dirty.Everything about him was unclean.Even the whites of his eyes looked soiled."
"我说得太过分了。沃什并不是样样东西都是脏的。他对自己的手就很小心。他的手指粗大，可放在电报局发报机旁的那只手却有着某种敏感而匀称的美感。年轻时，沃什·威姆斯曾被称作本州最佳发报员，尽管被贬到温斯堡发报局这么个不起眼的地方，他仍然为自己的能力自豪。","I go too fast.Not everything about Wash was unclean.He took care of his hands.His fingers were fat, but there was something sensitive and shapely in the hand that lay on the table by the instrument in the telegraph office.In his youth Wash Williams had been called the best telegraph operator in the state, and in spite of his degradement to the obscure office at Winesburg, he was still proud of his ability."
"沃什不与他住的这个镇上的人们来往。“我和他们没什么关系。”他说道，眼神朦胧地望着那些沿着车站月台经过发报局的人们。他在夜晚沿着大街走到埃德·格里菲思酒吧，不可思议地大喝一通后，步履蹒跚地回到新威拉德旅社自己的房间，上床睡觉。","Wash Williams did not associate with the men of the town in which he lived.“I’ll have nothing to do with them,” he said, looking with bleary eyes at the men who walked along the station platform past the telegraph office.Up along Main Street he went in the evening to Ed Griffith’s saloon, and after drinking unbelievable quantities of beer staggered off to his room in the New Willard House and to his bed for the night."
"沃什·威廉斯是个勇敢的人。发生在他身上的某件事让他痛恨生活，他以一个诗人的狂热对生活恨彻心肺。首先，他憎恨女人。“荡妇。”他这样称呼她们。他对男人的感情却有所不同。他可怜男人。“难道哪个男人不是让自己的生活被这个或是那个荡妇左右吗？”他问道。","Wash Williams was a man of courage.A thing had happened to him that made him hate life, and he hated it wholeheartedly, with the abandon of a poet.First of all, he hated women.“Bitches,” he called them.His feeling toward men was somewhat different.He pitied them.“Does not every man let his life be managed for him by some bitch or another?” he asked."
"在温斯堡，没人注意沃什，也没注意到他对人们的痛恨。有一次，银行家的夫人怀特太太向电报公司投诉说温斯堡的电报局办公室太脏，气味难闻，可是无人回应。总有人尊敬这位电报员。这类人本能地感到沃什内心有一种灼人的忿恨是他们不敢去做的。当沃什穿过街巷的时候，这样的人会对他肃然起敬，向他举帽致意或鞠躬行礼。监管温斯堡路段发报员的督察就有这样的感觉。他将沃什安置在温斯堡不起眼的办公室里，以免他被解雇，而且他特意将他留在那儿。当他收到银行家夫人的投诉信后，他将信撕毁，令人不快地笑了起来。出于某种原因，他撕信的时候想起了自己的妻子。","In Winesburg no attention was paid to Wash Williams and his hatred of his fellows.Once Mrs. White, the banker’s wife, complained to the telegraph company, saying that the office in Winesburg was dirty and smelled abominably, but nothing came of her complaint.Here and there a man respected the operator.Instinctively the man felt in him a glowing resentment of something he had not the courage to resent.When Wash walked through the streets such a one had an instinct to pay him homage, to raise his hat or to bow before him.The superintendent who had supervision over the telegraph operators on the railroad that went through Winesburg felt that way.He had put Wash into the obscure office at Winesburg to avoid discharging him, and he meant to keep him there.When he received the letter of complaint from the banker’s wife, he tore it up and laughed unpleasantly.For some reason he thought of his own wife as he tore up the letter."
"沃什·威廉斯曾有过一个妻子。年轻时，他在俄亥俄州的代顿娶过一个女人。那位女子高挑而苗条，有着蓝色的眼睛和黄色的头发。沃什那时也是个英俊的小伙子。他对妻子真挚的爱绝不亚于后来他对所有女人的恨。","Wash Williams once had a wife.When he was still a young man he married a woman at Dayton, Ohio.The woman was tall and slender and had blue eyes and yellow hair.Wash was himself a comely youth.He loved the woman with a love as absorbing as the hatred he later felt for all women."
"全温斯堡只有一个人知道这件事情的来龙去脉，这件事使沃什成为了一个外貌和性情都丑陋的人。他曾将故事讲给乔治·威拉德听，故事是这样开始的：","In all of Winesburg there was but one person who knew the story of the thing that had made ugly the person and the character of Wash Williams.He once told the story to George Willard and the telling of the tale came about in this way:"
"乔治·威拉德在一个傍晚同女帽装饰工贝拉·卡彭特一起散步，她在凯特·麦克林太太的女帽店里工作。这个年轻人并未爱上这个女人，事实上，贝拉有一名在埃德·格里菲思酒吧当酒保的追求者。可是，他们在树林下散步时，偶尔还是会拥抱。夜色和他们自己的思维唤起了他们心里的某种东西。他们返回大街时，经过车站旁的小草坪，看见沃什在一棵树下的草地上，显然是睡着了。第二天傍晚，发报员同乔治·威拉德一同去散步。他们沿着铁路走，在铁轨旁一堆腐烂的枕木上坐了下来。就是在那时，他对年轻的记者谈起了自己关于憎恨的故事。","George Willard went one evening to walk with Belle Carpenter, a trimmer of women’s hats who worked in a millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate McHugh.The young man was not in love with the woman, who, in fact, had a suitor who worked as bartender in Ed Griffith’s saloon, but as they walked about under the trees they occasionally embraced.The night and their own thoughts had aroused something in them.As they were returning to Main Street they passed the little lawn beside the railroad station and saw Wash Williams apparently asleep on the grass beneath a tree.On the next evening the operator and George Willard walked out together.Down the railroad they went and sat on a pile of decaying railroad ties beside the tracks.It was then that the operator told the young reporter his story of hate."
"或许，乔治·威拉德同住在他父亲旅社里的这位奇怪而丑陋的男人有过十几次交谈的契机。乔治看着这张可怕的、目光猥亵的脸，发现这人正凝望着旅社的餐厅，这个年轻人心里万分好奇。他在那双瞪大的眼睛里看到了些许隐藏着的东西，这个同他人无话可说的人却有些东西要告诉他。夏夜，他坐在一堆枕木上，满心期待地等着。那名发报员仍旧沉默，似乎改变了主意，不想说话了，于是他试着打开话题。“威廉斯先生，你结过婚吗？”他开口问道，“我猜你结过，可你的妻子去世了，是这样吗？”","Perhaps a dozen times George Willard and the strange, shapeless man who lived at his father’s hotel had been on the point of talking.The young man looked at the hideous, leering face staring about the hotel dining room and was consumed with curiosity.Something he saw lurking in the staring eyes told him that the man who had nothing to say to others had nevertheless something to say to him.On the pile of railroad ties on the summer evening, he waited expectantly.When the operator remained silent and seemed to have changed his mind about talking, he tried to make conversation.“Were you ever married, Mr. Williams?” he began.“I suppose you were and your wife is dead, is that it?”"
"沃什·威廉斯迸出一串不雅的咒骂。“是的，她死了。”他表示同意，“她和所有女人一样都死了。她就是个行尸走肉，在男人的面前晃动；她的存在弄得这世界一团糟。”这个男人凝视着小伙子的双眼，因为愤怒而脸涨得通红。“别在脑子里装蠢念头。”他以命令的口吻说道，“我的妻子，她死了；是的，没错。我告诉你，所有的女人都是死的，我的母亲，你的母亲，还有那个在帽子店工作的高个子的黑姑娘，我看见你和她昨天散步了——她们所有人，统统都死了。我跟你说，她们心里有些东西烂掉了。我结过婚，当然。我的妻子在嫁给我之前就死掉了，生养她的是个更糟糕的女人。她就是上天派来把我的生活弄得不堪忍受的东西。我就是个傻瓜，你明白吗，就像你现在这样，所以我娶了她。我想看到男人们开始稍微明白些女人的真相。她们是上天派来阻止男人创造世界的。这是造化的诡计。噢！她们有柔软的双手和蓝色的眼睛，是匍匐行进、来回扭动的东西。看见女人就让我恶心。我真不懂我怎么没看见一个杀一个。”","Wash Williams spat forth a succession of vile oaths.“Yes, she is dead,” he agreed.“She is dead as all women are dead.She is a living-dead thing, walking in the sight of men and making the earth foul by her presence.”Staring into the boy’s eyes, the man became purple with rage.“Don’t have fool notions in your head,” he commanded.“My wife, she is dead; yes, surely.I tell you, all women are dead, my mother, your mother, that tall dark woman who works in the millinery store and with whom I saw you walking about yesterday—all of them, they are all dead.I tell you there is something rotten about them.I was married, sure.My wife was dead before she married me, she was a foul thing come out a woman more foul.She was a thing sent to make life unbearable to me.I was a fool, do you see, as you are now, and so I married this woman.I would like to see men a little begin to understand women.They are sent to prevent men making the world worth while.It is a trick in Nature.Ugh! They are creeping, crawling, squirming things, they with their soft hands and their blue eyes.The sight of a woman sickens me.Why I don’t kill every woman I see I don’t know.”"
"乔治·威拉德有些害怕，可又被这个丑陋的老头眼睛里燃着的光吸引，便饶有兴味地听着。夜幕降临，他向前倾着身体，试图看清这个说话的老人的脸。夜幕渐浓，他再也看不见那张通红的、肿胀的脸和那双熊熊燃烧的眼睛，这时，一种奇异的幻想浮上心头。沃什·威廉斯用一种低沉而平缓的声调讲述着，这使他的话听起来更加可怕。在黑暗中，年轻的记者发现自己正想象着坐在身边铁轨枕木上的是个英俊的、有着黑发和闪闪发光的黑眼睛的年轻人。丑陋的沃什·威廉姆斯在讲述他那个关于憎恨的故事时，声音里似乎有种美的东西。","Half frightened and yet fascinated by the light burning in the eyes of the hideous old man, George Willard listened, afire with curiosity.Darkness came on and he leaned forward trying to see the face of the man who talked.When, in the gathering darkness, he could no longer see the purple, bloated face and the burning eyes, a curious fancy came to him.Wash Williams talked in low even tones that made his words seem the more terrible.In the darkness the young reporter found himself imagining that he sat on the railroad ties beside a comely young man with black hair and black shining eyes.There was something almost beautiful in the voice of Wash Williams, the hideous, telling his story of hate."
"黑暗中，坐在枕木上的这个电报员变成了一个诗人。仇恨将他培养成了一位诗人。　　“就是因为我看见你吻了贝拉·卡彭特，我才会告诉你我的故事。”他说，“我所遭遇的事或许将来会发生在你身上。我想让你小心。你或许已经在做梦了。我想打破这些梦。”","The telegraph operator of Winesburg, sitting in the darkness on the railroad ties, had become a poet.Hatred had raised him to that elevation.“It is because I saw you kissing the lips of that Belle Carpenter that I tell you my story,” he said.“What happened to me may next happen to you.I want to put you on your guard.Already you may be having dreams in your head.I want to destroy them.”"
"沃什·威廉斯开始讲述当他年轻时在俄亥俄州的代顿做发报员的时候同那个高个子的金发碧眼的姑娘相遇并结婚的故事。他的故事因拥有美丽的时刻而打动人心，可也时不时地夹杂着一连串恶毒的诅咒。这位发报员同一名牙医的三个女儿中最小的那一位结了婚。结婚当日，他由于能力出众升职做了分报员，薪水也涨了，然后被派往俄亥俄州哥伦布市的一间发报局。他同年轻的妻子在那里定居，并开始计划贷款买房。年轻的电报员处于疯狂的热恋之中。由于笃信宗教，他年轻时洁身自好，将处男之身保留到了婚前。他给乔治·威拉德描述了他同年轻的妻子在哥伦布市那所房子里的生活。“我们在房子后面的花园里种植蔬菜，”他说道，“你知道，就是豆子和玉米这一类的。我们在三月初去的哥伦布市，很快天气就变得暖和起来，我们到花园里去干活。我用锹将黑色的地翻过来，她就笑着四处跑，假装害怕被我挖出来的虫子。四月末，我们开始播种。她站在苗床的小田埂间，手里拿着个纸袋。袋子里装满了种子。每次她递给我一些种子，我再将它们插进温暖松软的土壤里。”","Wash Williams began telling the story of his married life with the tall blonde girl with the blue eyes whom he had met when he was a young operator at Dayton, Ohio.Here and there his story was touched with moments of beauty intermingled with strings of vile curses.The operator had married the daughter of a dentist who was the youngest of three sisters.On his marriage day, because of his ability, he was promoted to a position as dispatcher at an increased salary and sent to an office at Columbus, Ohio.There he settled down with his young wife and began buying a house on the installment plan.The young telegraph operator was madly in love.With a kind of religious fervor he had managed to go through the pitfalls of his youth and to remain virginal until after his marriage.He made for George Willard a picture of his life in the house at Columbus, Ohio, with the young wife. “In the garden back of our house we planted vegetables,” he said, “you know, peas and corn and such things.We went to Columbus in early March and as soon as the days became warm I went to work in the garden.With a spade I turned up the black ground while she ran about laughing and pretending to be afraid of the worms I uncovered.Late in April came the planting.In the little paths among the seed beds she stood holding a paper bag in her hand.The bag was filled with seeds.A few at a time she handed me the seeds that I might thrust them into the warm, soft ground.”"
"这个在黑暗中讲话的人声音里有片刻的哽咽。“我爱她。”他说，“我承认自己是个傻瓜。我仍旧爱她。春日的黄昏里，我爬过黑色的土地来到她的脚边，匍匐到她跟前。我亲吻她的鞋子和鞋子上面的脚踝。当她长裙的裙裾碰到我的脸时，我会颤抖。那样的生活过了两年之后，我发现她设法另外还拥有三个情人。他们常常在我外出工作的时候到我们的房子里来。我不想对他们或她兴师问罪。我只是把她送回了娘家，什么也没说。已经没有什么可说的了。我在银行里存了四百美元，我把钱都给了她。我没有问她原因。我什么都没说。她走的时候，我哭得像个傻呼呼的小孩子。很快，我找到机会把房子卖了，就把钱寄给了她。”","For a moment there was a catch in the voice of the man talking in the darkness.“I loved her,” he said.“I don’t claim not to be a fool.I love her yet.There in the dusk in the spring evening I crawled along the black ground to her feet and groveled before her.I kissed her shoes and the ankles above her shoes.When the hem of her garment touched my face I trembled.When after two years of that life I found she had managed to acquire three other lovers who came regularly to our house when I was away at work, I didn’t want to touch them or her.I just sent her home to her mother and said nothing.There was nothing to say.I had four hundred dollars in the bank and I gave her that.I didn’t ask her reasons.I didn’t say anything.When she had gone I cried like a silly boy.Pretty soon I had a chance to sell the house and I sent that money to her.”"
"沃什·威廉斯和乔治·威拉德从枕木上站起来，沿着铁轨向镇里走去。发报员迅速地一口气结束了他的故事。","Wash Williams and George Willard arose from the pile of railroad ties and walked along the tracks toward town.The operator finished his tale quickly, breathlessly."
"“她的母亲派人来找我。”他说，“她给我写了信，要我回她们代顿的房子那里。我到的时候，就和现在一样是夜晚。”","“Her mother sent for me,” he said.“She wrote me a letter and asked me to come to their house at Dayton.When I got there it was evening about this time.”"
"他的声音抬高，几乎是在尖叫了。“我在那所房子的门廊里坐了两个小时。她的妈妈将我带进去后就离开了。那所房子很时髦。他们是所谓的受人尊敬的人。房间里有几张长毛绒的椅子和一张长沙发。我浑身都在发抖。我恨那些我认为使她受冤的男人们。我厌倦了独自生活，想让她回来。等待的时间越长，我就变得越痛苦和脆弱。我想，如果她进来就用手碰碰我，我也许就会晕倒。我渴望既往不咎。”","Wash Williams’ voice rose to a half scream.“I sat in the parlor of that house two hours.Her mother took me in there and left me.Their house was stylish.They were what is called respectable people.There were plush chairs and a couch in the room.I was trembling all over.I hated the men I thought had wronged her.I was sick of living alone and wanted her back.The longer I waited the more raw and tender I became.I thought that if she came in and just touched me with her hand I would perhaps faint away.I ached to forgive and forget.”"
"沃什·威廉斯停下来站住，盯着乔治·威拉德。乔治的身体不寒而栗。沃什的声音再次变得低沉而柔和。“她光着身子走进了房间。”他继续说道，“是她妈妈的主意。我坐在那里的时候，她脱掉女儿的衣服，或许是半哄半劝地。一开始，我听到通往小走廊的门边传来的声音，接着门轻轻打开了。我的前妻很羞愧，一动不动地站着，眼睛仍盯着地板。她的妈妈并没进来。当她把女儿从门里推进来的时候，她就站在走廊里等着，希望我们能——嗯，你明白的——就等着。”","Wash Williams stopped and stood staring at George Willard.The boy’s body shook as from a chill.Again the man’s voice became soft and low.“She came into the room naked,” he went on.“Her mother did that.While I sat there she was taking the girl’s clothes off, perhaps coaxing her to do it.First I heard voices at the door that led into a little hallway and then it opened softly.The girl was ashamed and stood perfectly still staring at the floor.The mother didn’t come into the room.When she had pushed the girl in through the door she stood in the hallway waiting, hoping we would—well, you see—waiting.”"
"乔治·威拉德同发报员来到了温斯堡的大街上。商店窗户里灯火通明，灯光照在了人行道上。人们来来往往，笑着，交谈着。年轻的记者感到不舒服，浑身无力。在幻想中，他也变得又老又丑了。“我没有杀掉那位母亲。”沃什·威廉斯说道，上下打量着街道。“我用椅子砸了她一下，接着邻居们进来，拿走了椅子。她叫得那样大声，你知道。我现在也没有机会去杀她了。事情发生一个月后，她死于热病。”","George Willard and the telegraph operator came into the main street of Winesburg.The lights from the store windows lay bright and shining on the sidewalks.People moved about laughing and talking.The young reporter felt ill and weak.In imagination, he also became old and shapeless.“I didn’t get the mother killed,” said Wash Williams, staring up and down the street.“I struck her once with a chair and then the neighbors came in and took it away.She screamed so loud you see.I won’t ever have a chance to kill her now.She died of a fever a month after that happened.”"
"第十章 思考者","Chapter 10 The Thinker"
"塞斯·里士满与母亲在温斯堡住的房子曾是镇上的观光胜地，但是，在塞斯幼时住在那里的时候，它就已经多少有些不复当年的荣光了。银行家怀特在七叶树街上建的巨大砖房将它笼罩在其阴影之下。里士满家的房子在大街尽头远远的一个小山谷里。沿着南面尘土飞扬的马路过来准备进镇的农夫们会经过一片核桃树林，绕过集市广场，那里建着高高的贴满了广告的木板围栏，然后，他们会放慢速度，让马小跑着穿过山谷，经由里士满家进入镇里。温斯堡的南北两边乡村大都经营水果和浆果种植，因此，塞斯看得到一车车的采浆果的工人——男孩们、女孩们、还有女人们——早上到田里去，傍晚时分满面尘土地回来。这群喧闹的人，说着粗俗的笑话，从这辆马车上朝那辆马车大叫大嚷。有时，这一切会让他烦躁得抓狂。他懊恼自己不能也那样肆意地大笑，大声讲些毫无意义的玩笑话，成为这路上来来往往、川流不息的嘻嘻哈哈大军中的一员。","The house in which Seth Richmond of Winesburg lived with his mother had been at one time the show place of the town, but when young Seth lived there its glory had become somewhat dimmed.The huge brick house which Banker White had built on Buckeye Street had overshadowed it.The Richmond place was in a little valley far out at the end of Main Street.Farmers coming into town by a dusty road from the south passed by a grove of walnut trees, skirted the Fair Ground with its high board fence covered with advertisements, and trotted their horses down through the valley past the Richmond place into town.As much of the country north and south of Winesburg was devoted to fruit and berry raising, Seth saw wagon-loads of berry pickers—boys, girls, and women—going to the fields in the morning and returning covered with dust in the evening.The chattering crowd, with their rude jokes cried out from wagon to wagon, sometimes irritated him sharply.He regretted that he also could not laugh boisterously, shout meaningless jokes and make of himself a figure in the endless stream of moving, giggling activity that went up and down the road."
"里士满家的房子是用石灰建的，尽管村里的人总说它已变得衰败了，可事实上，随着时光流逝，它反倒变得愈发美丽了。时光已经开始一点点地给石头涂上了颜色，将鲜艳富丽的金色涂在表面，而在傍晚或是阴天再将屋檐下被遮盖的地方涂上起伏的一块块棕色和黑色。塞斯的祖父——一个采石工人——亲手建造了这间房子。后来，他将这房子连同往北十八英里的伊利湖边的采石场一起留给了儿子克拉伦斯·里士满，也就是塞斯的父亲。克拉伦斯·里士满是一个安静又热情的人，深受邻居们的欣赏。可一次，他在俄亥俄州托莱多的街上同一家报社的编辑打架时被杀了。那场纠纷的起因是克拉伦斯·里士满的名字同一个女教师的名字被同时刊登了出来，由于纠纷是死者向编辑开枪而引发的，惩处凶手的努力便无果而终。在他死后，人们才发现留给他的大量遗产都在朋友们的怂恿下被用来进行投机买卖和风险投资而挥霍掉了。","The Richmond house was built of limestone, and, although it was said in the village to have become run down, had in reality grown more beautiful with every passing year.Already time had begun a little to color the stone, lending a golden richness to its surface and in the evening or on dark days touching the shaded places beneath the eaves with wavering patches of browns and blacks.The house had been built by Seth’s grandfather, a stone quarryman, and it, together with the stone quarries on Lake Erie eighteen miles to the north, had been left to his son, Clarence Richmond, Seth’s father.Clarence Richmond, a quiet passionate man extraordinarily admired by his neighbors, had been killed in a street fight with the editor of a newspaper in Toledo, Ohio.The fight concerned the publication of Clarence Richmond’s name coupled with that of a woman school teacher, and as the dead man had begun the row by firing upon the editor, the effort to punish the slayer was unsuccessful.After the quarryman’s death it was found that much of the money left to him had been squandered in speculation and in insecure investments made through the influence of friends."
"他的妻子弗吉尼亚·里士满只剩下了一点微薄的收入。于是她在乡村过起了退隐生活，一心抚养儿子。尽管她因丈夫和公公的死而悲痛万分，可她一点儿也不相信人们在丈夫死后所说的那些事情。在她想来，敏感而有些孩子气的丈夫是个人见人爱的人，只不过他很走运，由于太完美了而不能见容于世。“你会听到各种流言，可你绝不要相信。”她对儿子说，“他是个好人，对人温和，不会惹是生非。无论我将如何计划和想象你的未来，我都认为你长大后能成为一个像你父亲一样的好人是最好的选择。”","Left with but a small income, Virginia Richmond had settled down to a retired life in the village and to the raising of her son.Although she had been deeply moved by the death of the husband and father, she did not at all believe the stories concerning him that ran about after his death.To her mind, the sensitive, boyish man whom all had instinctively loved, was but an unfortunate, a being too fine for everyday life.“You’ll be hearing all sorts of stories, but you are not to believe what you hear,” she said to her son.“He was a good man, full of tenderness for everyone, and should not have tried to be a man of affairs.No matter how much I were to plan and dream of your future, I could not imagine anything better for you than that you turn out as good a man as your father.”"
"丈夫死后的几年，弗吉尼亚·里士满渐渐对入不敷出的状况感到惊慌，于是便开始工作以增加收入。她学过速记，在丈夫朋友们的帮助下，她找到了法庭速记员的工作。在开庭的日子里，她每天清晨乘火车前往法院；没有庭审的时候，她便在自家花园的玫瑰丛里工作来打发日子。她是个高个子、身材笔挺的女人，长相普通，有一头浓密的棕发。","Several years after the death of her husband, Virginia Richmond had become alarmed at the growing demands upon her income and had set herself to the task of increasing it.She had learned stenography and through the influence of her husband’s friends got the position of court stenographer at the county seat.There she went by train each morning during the sessions of the court, and when no court sat, spent her days working among the rosebushes in her garden.She was a tall, straight figure of a woman with a plain face and a great mass of brown hair."
"塞斯同母亲的关系中有一种特质，甚至，在十八岁时，那种特质已经开始体现在他同其他男性的交往上。一种可以算得上是对年轻人并不健康的尊重使得他的母亲同他在一起的大多数时候都缄默不语。当她对他严词厉色的时候，他就平静地望着她的眼睛，看着里面浮现出一种困惑的神情，而这样的神情他已经在别人身上试验并见证过了。","In the relationship between Seth Richmond and his mother, there was a quality that even at eighteen had begun to color all of his traffic with men.An almost unhealthy respect for the youth kept the mother for the most part silent in his presence.When she did speak sharply to him he had only to look steadily into her eyes to see dawning there the puzzled look he had already noticed in the eyes of others when he looked at them."
"事实上，儿子心里非常明白，可母亲却不然。她原以为所有的人对生活都有着某种惯常的反应。如果你的孩子是个儿子，你责骂他时，他便会颤抖着望着地面。等你骂够了，他便应当呜呜哭泣，于是一切便得到谅解。哭泣过后，他回去睡觉，你再悄悄地走进他的房间去亲吻他。","The truth was that the son thought with remarkable clearness and the mother did not.She expected from all people certain conventional reactions to life.A boy was your son, you scolded him and he trembled and looked at the floor.When you had scolded enough he wept and all was forgiven.After the weeping and when he had gone to bed, you crept into his room and kissed him."
"弗吉尼亚·里士满不明白为什么她的儿子不这样做。即使是在最严厉的苛责过后，他也不会颤抖着望向地面，而是平静地望着她，使得她心里生出不安的疑虑。至于悄悄进入他的房间——在塞斯长到十五岁之后，她怕是不敢再做这类事情了。","Virginia Richmond could not understand why her son did not do these things.After the severest reprimand, he did not tremble and look at the floor but instead looked steadily at her, causing uneasy doubts to invade her mind.As for creeping into his room—after Seth had passed his fifteenth year, she would have been half afraid to do anything of the kind."
"在塞斯还是个十六岁的少年时，曾经同另外两个男生结伴离家出走过。三个少年爬进一辆开着门的空货车，车开了大约四十英里后来到了一个正在举办市集的小镇。其中一个少年带了一满瓶酒，里面混合了威士忌和黑莓酒，他们三个人晃荡着双腿坐在车门边，喝着这瓶酒。塞斯的两个伙伴唱着歌，向在小镇上火车经过的车站周围闲晃的人挥着手。他们计划去抢那些带着家眷来赶集的农夫们的篮子。“我们会像国王一样生活，一分钱也不必花就可以逛市集、看赛马。”他们大声地吹嘘着。","Once when he was a boy of sixteen, Seth in company with two other boys ran away from home.The three boys climbed into the open door of an empty freight car and rode some forty miles to a town where a fair was being held.One of the boys had a bottle filled with a combination of whiskey and blackberry wine, and the three sat with legs dangling out of the car door drinking from the bottle.Seth’s two companions sang and waved their hands to idlers about the stations of the towns through which the train passed.They planned raids upon the baskets of farmers who had come with their families to the fair.“We will live like kings and won’t have to spend a penny to see the fair and horse races,” they declared boastfully."
"塞斯失踪后，弗吉尼亚在房间的地板上来回踱步，心中隐约感到惊恐。尽管第二天她就通过镇警司的侦讯了解了这场冒险的始末，她仍然无法使自己平静。整个夜晚，她都睡不着，躺着听钟声滴答，她告诉自己，塞斯会和他的父亲一样，最后有个突然而惨烈的结局。尽管她没打算让警长来插手此事，她仍旧决定是时候让儿子感觉到她愤怒的份量了。她拿出铅笔和纸，写下一长串尖锐而严厉的训斥，打算劈头盖脸地训斥他一顿。她在花园里走来走去，专心背着那些训斥的话。她大声地讲着，就像演员在背台词。","After the disappearance of Seth, Virginia Richmond walked up and down the floor of her home filled with vague alarms.Although on the next day she discovered, through an inquiry made by the town marshal, on what adventure the boys had gone, she could not quiet herself.All through the night she lay awake hearing the clock tick and telling herself that Seth, like his father, would come to a sudden and violent end.So determined was she that the boy should this time feel the weight of her wrath that, although she would not allow the marshal to interfere with his adventure, she got out a pencil and paper and wrote down a series of sharp, stinging reproofs she intended to pour out upon him.The reproofs she committed to memory, going about the garden and saying them aloud like an actor memorizing his part."
"等到周末的时候，塞斯回来了，有些疲惫，耳朵里、眼睛旁都是煤灰，她又觉得自己不忍责骂他。他走进房子里，将帽子挂在厨房门上的钉子上，然后站在那里凝视着她。“我们离开一个小时后我就想回来了。”他解释道，“可我不知道怎么做。我知道你会担心，可我也知道如果我不继续下去，我会为自己感到羞愧的。我是为了自己做完这件事情的。睡在湿漉漉的草上的感觉很不舒服，还有两个喝醉了的黑鬼过来和我们睡在一起。我从一个农夫的马车上偷走一个午餐篮的时候，不禁在想他的孩子们会一天都没东西吃。我对这整件事情感到厌烦，可我决心将它做完，直到另两个人准备回来。”","And when, at the end of the week, Seth returned, a little weary and with coal soot in his ears and about his eyes, she again found herself unable to reprove him.Walking into the house he hung his cap on a nail by the kitchen door and stood looking steadily at her.“I wanted to turn back within an hour after we had started,” he explained.“I didn’t know what to do.I knew you would be bothered, but I knew also that if I didn’t go on I would be ashamed of myself.I went through with the thing for my own good.It was uncomfortable, sleeping on wet straw, and two drunken Negroes came and slept with us.When I stole a lunch basket out of a farmer’s wagon I couldn’t help thinking of his children going all day without food.I was sick of the whole affair, but I was determined to stick it out until the other boys were ready to come back.”"
"“我很高兴你坚持到底了。”母亲半是怨恨地答道，然后在他的前额上亲了亲，假装忙活家务事去了。","“I’m glad you did stick it out,” replied the mother, half resentfully, and kissing him upon the forehead pretended to busy herself with the work about the house."
"一个夏日的傍晚，塞斯·里士满到新威拉德旅社去拜访他的朋友——乔治·威拉德。整个下午都在下雨，可他走过大街的时候，天已经开始有些放晴，一道金光点亮了西边。转过一个弯，他来到了旅社的门前，开始爬那段通向他朋友房间的楼梯。旅社的办公室里，老板同两个旅客正忙于谈论政治。","On a summer evening Seth Richmond went to the New Willard House to visit his friend, George Willard.It had rained during the afternoon, but as he walked through Main Street, the sky had partially cleared and a golden glow lit up the west.Going around a corner, he turned in at the door of the hotel and began to climb the stairway leading up to his friend’s room.In the hotel office the proprietor and two traveling men were engaged in a discussion of politics."
"塞斯在楼梯上停住了，听着楼下男人们的声音。他们非常兴奋，飞快地说着。汤姆·威拉德正在严厉指责那两个旅客。“我是个民主党人，可你说的话让我厌烦。”他说，“你不了解麦金利。麦金利和马克·汉纳是朋友。以你们的心智，理解这点或许是不可能的。如果有人对你说友谊比金钱更深切、更重要、更有价值，或者比国家政治更重要，你们就会窃笑、大笑了。”","On the stairway Seth stopped and listened to the voices of the men below.They were excited and talked rapidly.Tom Willard was berating the traveling men.“I am a Democrat but your talk makes me sick,” he said.“You don’t understand McKinley.McKinley and Mark Hanna are friends.It is impossible perhaps for your mind to grasp that.If anyone tells you that a friendship can be deeper and bigger and more worth while than dollars and cents, or even more worth while than state politics, you snicker and laugh.”"
"其中一位在批发杂货店工作的高个子、留着灰胡子的旅客打断了这个老板。“难道你认为我在克利夫兰住了这些年都不了解马克·汉纳吗？”他诘问道，“你在瞎说。汉纳就只会要钱。这个麦金利就是他的工具。他连麦金利都骗了，你别忘了。”","The landlord was interrupted by one of the guests, a tall, grey-mustached man who worked for a wholesale grocery house.“Do you think that I’ve lived in Cleveland all these years without knowing Mark Hanna?” he demanded.“Your talk is piffle.Hanna is after money and nothing else.This McKinley is his tool.He has McKinley bluffed and don’t you forget it.”"
"站在楼梯上的年轻人没有再听下去，而是继续上楼，进到那个又小又黑的门厅里。这群男人在办公室里的谈话中有某些东西使他开始思考。他很孤独，已经开始认为孤独是他性格的一部分，会一直存在。他走进一个侧厅，站在一扇可以望见小巷的窗边。小镇的面包师阿布纳·格罗夫站在他店铺的后部。他那细小的、充血的眼睛在来回逡巡着小巷。有人在店里叫他，他假装没听见。他手里拿着个空奶瓶，眼睛里露出愤怒、阴郁的表情。","The young man on the stairs did not linger to hear the rest of the discussion, but went on up the stairway and into the little dark hall.Something in the voices of the men talking in the hotel office started a chain of thoughts in his mind.He was lonely and had begun to think that loneliness was a part of his character, something that would always stay with him.Stepping into a side hall he stood by a window that looked into an alleyway.At the back of his shop stood Abner Groff, the town baker.His tiny bloodshot eyes looked up and down the alleyway.In his shop someone called the baker, who pretended not to hear.The baker had an empty milk bottle in his hand and an angry sullen look in his eyes."
"塞斯·里士满在温斯堡被称为“深沉的人”。“他就像他的父亲。”当他走过街道时人们这么说，“他会在某一天爆发的。你们就等着瞧吧。”","In Winesburg, Seth Richmond was called the “deep one.”“He’s like his father,” men said as he went through the streets.“He’ll break out some of these days.You wait and see.”"
"小镇里的这种言论，以及所有男人和男孩不由主地对他表示的尊重——正如所有人对沉默者的致意——已经影响到了塞斯对生活和对自己的看法。像大多数的男孩子一样，他比人们所认为的要老成，可是，他也并不是小镇的人们甚至他母亲所认为的那个样子。在他习惯性的沉默背后并没隐藏什么远大目标，他对自己的生活甚至没有确定的计划。同他交往的同龄人在吵闹、争吵的时候，他就静静地站在一边。他用冷静的眼光观察同伴们指手画脚的活泼身影。他对正在进行着的一切并不是特别感兴趣，有些时候，他曾好奇自己是否会对什么特别感兴趣。现在，当他站在光线不明的窗边，看着那个面包师，他真希望自己也能被什么完全激怒，即使是像生闷气出了名的面包师格罗夫那样也好。“如果我能像夸夸其谈的老汤姆·威拉德那样因为政治而变得激动起来，并为此争吵也是好的。”他想着，同时从窗户边走开，再次沿着走廊往朋友乔治·威拉德所在的房间走去。","The talk of the town and the respect with which men and boys instinctively greeted him, as all men greet silent people, had affected Seth Richmond’s outlook on life and on himself.He, like most boys, was deeper than boys are given credit for being, but he was not what the men of the town, and even his mother, thought him to be.No great underlying purpose lay back of his habitual silence, and he had no definite plan for his life.When the boys with whom he associated were noisy and quarrelsome, he stood quietly at one side.With calm eyes he watched the gesticulating lively figures of his companions.He wasn’t particularly interested in what was going on, and sometimes wondered if he would ever be particularly interested in anything.Now, as he stood in the half-darkness by the window watching the baker, he wished that he himself might become thoroughly stirred by something, even by the fits of sullen anger for which Baker Groff was noted.“It would be better for me if I could become excited and wrangle about politics like windy old Tom Willard,” he thought, as he left the window and went again along the hallway to the room occupied by his friend, George Willard."
"乔治·威拉德比他年长，但是在两人奇特的友谊中，却总是乔治主动，而塞斯处于被动位置。乔治工作的报社有一个规定。那就是尽可能地在每个报道中提及乡村居民的名字。乔治·威拉德像条兴奋的狗一样四处奔波，在记事本上记载下哪个人到县政府去办事，或者谁到邻村去串门后又回来了。他整天在纸上记下琐碎的事件。“A. P. 温莱特刚收到了一批草帽。埃德·拜尔波姆和汤姆·马歇尔周五呆在克利夫兰。汤姆·思宁斯大叔正在河谷路自己的房子那儿建一个新的谷仓。”","George Willard was older than Seth Richmond, but in the rather odd friendship between the two, it was he who was forever courting and the younger boy who was being courted.The paper on which George worked had one policy.It strove to mention by name in each issue, as many as possible of the inhabitants of the village.Like an excited dog, George Willard ran here and there, noting on his pad of paper who had gone on business to the county seat or had returned from a visit to a neighboring village.All day he wrote little facts upon the pad.“A. P. Wringlet had received a shipment of straw hats.Ed Byerbaum and Tom Marshall were in Cleveland Friday.Uncle Tom Sinnings is building a new barn on his place on the Valley Road.”"
"人们认为乔治·威拉德将来会成为作家，因此温斯堡人都十分尊敬他。他总是向塞斯·里士满提起此事：“这样活着是最容易的。”他大声说着，变得激动而自豪，“你去哪里都成，没人对你发号施令。就算你在印度或是南海岸的船上，只需要动动笔，目的就达到了。等我成了名，再看看我能写出点什么有趣的东西来。”","The idea that George Willard would some day become a writer had given him a place of distinction in Winesburg, and to Seth Richmond he talked continually of the matter, “It’s the easiest of all lives to live,” he declared, becoming excited and boastful.“Here and there you go and there is no one to boss you.Though you are in India or in the South Seas in a boat, you have but to write and there you are.Wait till I get my name up and then see what fun I shall have.”"
"透过乔治·威拉德房间里的一扇窗户可以往下看到巷子，透过另一扇能越过铁轨看到车站对面比夫·卡特午餐厅；塞斯坐在一张扶手椅上，眼睛望着地板。乔治·威拉德已经在屋里坐了一个小时，百无聊赖地转着一支铅笔玩。他过分热情地迎接了他。“我一直在试着写一个爱情故事。”他解释道，神经兮兮地大笑着。他点了一支烟，开始在房间里来回地走。“我知道自己该干什么。我打算谈恋爱。我坐在这儿仔细地想过了，打算实践一下。”","In George Willard’s room, which had a window looking down into an alleyway and one that looked across railroad tracks to Biff Carter’s Lunch Room facing the railroad station, Seth Richmond sat in a chair and looked at the floor.George Willard, who had been sitting for an hour idly playing with a lead pencil, greeted him effusively.“I’ve been trying to write a love story,” he explained, laughing nervously.Lighting a pipe he began walking up and down the room.“I know what I’m going to do.I’m going to fall in love.I’ve been sitting here and thinking it over and I’m going to do it.”"
"乔治像是被自己的宣言给窘住了；他来到窗边，背对着他的朋友，探出身去。“我也知道我打算同谁恋爱。”他尖声地说，“就是海伦·怀特。她是镇上唯一一个‘会打扮’的姑娘。”","As though embarrassed by his declaration, George went to a window and turning his back to his friend leaned out.“I know who I’m going to fall in love with,” he said sharply.“It’s Helen White.She is the only girl in town with any ‘get-up’ to her.”"
"忽然，年轻的威拉德想到了一个新点子，向朋友走过去。“喂，”他说，“你比我熟悉海伦·怀特。我想让你去告诉她我的想法。你就去跟她说我爱上了她。看看她会说些什么。看看她的反应，你再回来告诉我。“","Struck with a new idea, young Willard turned and walked toward his visitor.“Look here,” he said.“You know Helen White better than I do.I want you to tell her what I said.You just get to talking to her and say that I’m in love with her.See what she says to that.See how she takes it, and then you come and tell me.”"
"塞斯·里士满站起来，向门走去。他朋友的话让他恼怒得无法忍受。“那么，再见。”他简短地说。","Seth Richmond arose and went toward the door.The words of his comrade irritated him unbearably.“Well, good-bye,” he said briefly."
"乔治被惊呆了。他跑上前去，站在黑暗中，试着看清塞斯的脸。“怎么了？你准备干什么？你别走，我们谈谈。”他请求道。一阵忿恨涌上塞斯的心头，他认为，城里人总是聊些没有意义的事，大多数都与他沉默的习惯背道而驰，这使得他几乎绝望。“喔，你自己去对她说吧。”他突然喊道，然后迅速走出了门口，当着朋友的面狠狠地摔上了门。“我这就去找海伦·怀特谈谈，但不会提他。”他低声咕哝着。","George was amazed.Running forward he stood in the darkness trying to look into Seth’s face.“What’s the matter?What are you going to do?You stay here and let’s talk,” he urged.A wave of resentment directed against his friend, the men of the town who were, he thought, perpetually talking of nothing, and most of all, against his own habit of silence, made Seth half desperate.“Aw, speak to her yourself,” he burst forth and then, going quickly through the door, slammed it sharply in his friend’s face.“I’m going to find Helen White and talk to her, but not about him,” he muttered."
"塞斯下了楼梯，走出旅社的大门，还在忿然地低声抱怨着。他穿过一条满是尘土的小道，爬过一道低矮的铁栏杆，在车站广场的草地上坐了下来。乔治·威拉德真是个大傻瓜，他暗地想，真希望自己刚才能说得更大声些。尽管他同银行家的女儿海伦·怀特的交情表面上是随意的，可她却经常是他遐想的对象，对他而言，她是自己的某种私有物。“那个忙碌的傻瓜，还有他的爱情小说，”他咕哝着，转过头去盯着乔治·威拉德的房间，“他怎么就从不厌烦自己的喋喋不休。”","Seth went down the stairway and out at the front door of the hotel muttering with wrath.Crossing a little dusty street and climbing a low iron railing, he went to sit upon the grass in the station yard.George Willard he thought a profound fool, and he wished that he had said so more vigorously.Although his acquaintanceship with Helen White, the banker’s daughter, was outwardly but casual, she was often the subject of his thoughts and he felt that she was something private and personal to himself.“The busy fool with his love stories,” he muttered, staring back over his shoulder at George Willard’s room, “why does he never tire of his eternal talking.”"
"现在正是温斯堡浆果收获的季节，在车站的月台上，男人们和小伙子们将整箱整箱芳香四溢的红色果子装到停在铁路旁轨上的两辆快车车厢里。尽管西边一场暴风雨即将来临，街灯一盏都没有点亮，但一轮六月的明月仍旧高高挂在天空。在昏暗的光线里，站在快车车厢边和在车门边往里搬箱子的人影只能依稀可见。另外一些人则坐在车站周围保护草坪的铁栏杆上。他们点着烟斗。时不时地说着些乡下的笑话。远处传来了火车的呼啸声，装箱的人又干得起劲起来。","It was berry harvest time in Winesburg and upon the station platform men and boys loaded the boxes of red, fragrant berries into two express cars that stood upon the siding.A June moon was in the sky, although in the west a storm threatened, and no street lamps were lighted.In the dim light the figures of the men standing upon the express truck and pitching the boxes in at the doors of the cars were but dimly discernible.Upon the iron railing that protected the station lawn sat other men.Pipes were lighted.Village jokes went back and forth.Away in the distance a train whistled and the men loading the boxes into the cars worked with renewed activity."
"塞斯从草地上起来，默默地经过栏杆上休息的人们，走到大街上。他下定了一个决心。“我要离开这儿。”他对自己说，“我在这儿有什么好呆的？我要去某个城市找份工作。明天我就告诉妈妈。”","Seth arose from his place on the grass and went silently past the men perched upon the railing and into Main Street.He had come to a resolution.“I’ll get out of here,” he told himself.“What good am I here?I’m going to some city and go to work.I’ll tell mother about it tomorrow.”"
"塞斯·里士满沿着大街慢慢走着，经过了瓦克尔香烟店和温斯堡政府大厅，来到了七叶树街。他无法融入自己生活的这所小镇，这个想法让他感到沮丧。可是，因为他并不觉得是自己有错，所以，这种沮丧程度并不深。在威林医生房前的一棵大树的浓重阴影里，他停了下来，站在那里望着傻呼呼的特克·斯莫利特，这人正在路上推着一辆独轮手推车。这个幼稚、愚蠢的老头在车上放了十几块长木板。他一边忙着赶路，一边费尽心思地保持木板的平衡。“慢点儿，特克！现在稳着点儿，老伙计！”老头儿对着自己大声叫着，笑的声音那么大，连车上的木板都岌岌可危地摇晃起来。","Seth Richmond went slowly along Main Street, past Wacker’s Cigar Store and the Town Hall, and into Buckeye Street.He was depressed by the thought that he was not a part of the life in his own town, but the depression did not cut deeply as he did not think of himself as at fault.In the heavy shadows of a big tree before Doctor Welling’s house, he stopped and stood watching half-witted Turk Smollet, who was pushing a wheelbarrow in the road.The old man with his absurdly boyish mind had a dozen long boards on the wheelbarrow, and, as he hurried along the road, balanced the load with extreme nicety.“Easy there, Turk!Steady now, old boy!” the old man shouted to himself, and laughed so that the load of boards rocked dangerously."
"塞斯了解这个几乎可以说是危险的老伐木工人特克·斯莫利特，他的古怪给乡间生活增色不少。他知道每当特克到镇上大街去，总会成为众矢之的。事实上，老头儿是特意绕远从大街上经过，想展示一下他推木板的绝技。“如果乔治·威拉德在这儿，他准会有话说。”塞斯想，“乔治是属于这所小镇的。他会嘲笑特克，然后特克也会回嘴。他们都会暗自为这种交流感到满意。可我不一样。我不属于这里。我不会对此大惊小怪，可我打算离开。”","Seth knew Turk Smollet, the half dangerous old wood chopper whose peculiarities added so much of color to the life of the village.He knew that when Turk got into Main Street he would become the center of a whirlwind of cries and comments, that in truth the old man was going far out of his way in order to pass through Main Street and exhibit his skill in wheeling the boards.“If George Willard were here, he’d have something to say,” thought Seth.“George belongs to this town.He’d shout at Turk and Turk would shout at him.They’d both be secretly pleased by what they had said.It’s different with me.I don’t belong.I’ll not make a fuss about it, but I’m going to get out of here.”"
"塞斯在昏暗中蹒跚前行，觉得自己是个自己城镇的弃儿。他开始可怜自己，可是这种荒唐的想法让他笑了起来。最后，他断定，自己只不过是过于老成了，完全不必自怜自艾。“我生来就是要工作的。我或许能靠稳定的工作为自己找到一席之地，我不妨就这么干。”他下定了决心。","Seth stumbled forward through the half-darkness, feeling himself an outcast in his own town.He began to pity himself, but a sense of the absurdity of his thoughts made him smile.In the end he decided that he was simply old beyond his years and not at all a subject for self-pity.“I’m made to go to work.I may be able to make a place for myself by steady working, and I might as well be at it,” he decided."
"塞斯来到银行家怀特的房子前，站在前门的阴暗处里。门上挂了一个沉甸甸的铜质门环，这是海伦·怀特的母亲在村里做的一个革新，她还组建了一个女子诗歌研究俱乐部。塞斯举起门环，然后让它落下。门环发出一阵沉重的声响，就像远处传来的枪声。“我真是又笨又傻，”他想，“如果怀特太太出来开门，我都不知道该说些什么。”","Seth went to the house of Banker White and stood in the darkness by the front door.On the door hung a heavy brass knocker, an innovation introduced into the village by Helen White’s mother, who had also organized a women’s club for the study of poetry.Seth raised the knocker and let it fall.Its heavy clatter sounded like a report from distant guns.“How awkward and foolish I am,” he thought.“If Mrs. White comes to the door, I won’t know what to say.”"
"海伦·怀特自己来开的门，她看见塞斯站在门廊的边上。她因为愉快而涨红了脸；她轻轻关上门，走上前来。“我打算离开这个小镇。我不知道会做什么，可是我准备离开这儿去工作。我想我会去哥伦布市。”他说，“也许我会去上那里的州立大学。无论怎样，我要走了。今晚我就告诉妈妈。”","It was Helen White who came to the door and found Seth standing at the edge of the porch.Blushing with pleasure, she stepped forward, closing the door softly.“I’m going to get out of town.I don’t know what I’ll do, but I’m going to get out of here and go to work.I think I’ll go to Columbus,” he said.“Perhaps I’ll get into the State University down there.Anyway, I’m going.I’ll tell mother tonight.”"
"他踌躇着，犹疑地四处张望。“或许你不介意同我散一会儿步吧？”","He hesitated and looked doubtfully about.“Perhaps you wouldn’t mind coming to walk with me?”"
"塞斯和海伦在树林下的街道上散着步。大片乌云从月亮表面掠过，在浓浓的暮色中，有个人肩扛着一个短梯子从他们身边经过。他急匆匆地往前走着，在街边的十字路口停下来，将梯子靠在木头灯柱上，点亮了村里的路灯。于是，在路灯下，在低矮的树枝投射的浓重阴影下，他们走的路变得半明半暗。树梢上开始有风吹过，惊醒了沉睡的鸟儿，于是，它们随风飞起，哀哀地叫着。在一盏路灯前面的一个光线明亮的地方，有两只蝙蝠盘旋飞行着，追逐着聚集起来的夜蝇群。","Seth and Helen walked through the streets beneath the trees.Heavy clouds had drifted across the face of the moon, and before them in the deep twilight went a man with a short ladder upon his shoulder.Hurrying forward, the man stopped at the street crossing and, putting the ladder against the wooden lamp-post, lighted the village lights so that their way was half lighted, half darkened, by the lamps and by the deepening shadows cast by the low-branched trees.In the tops of the trees the wind began to play, disturbing the sleeping birds so that they flew about calling plaintively.In the lighted space before one of the lamps, two bats wheeled and circled, pursuing the gathering swarm of night flies."
"从塞斯还是个穿短裤的男孩开始，他与这个如今第一次同他并肩散步的少女之间就有种只差言明的亲昵。她曾经一度因沉迷于给塞斯写便条而苦恼不已。在学校，他发现这些便条被藏在了他的书本里。有一次一个小孩子在路上递给他一张便条，还有几张是从村邮局寄来的。","Since Seth had been a boy in knee trousers there had been a half expressed intimacy between him and the maiden who now for the first time walked beside him.For a time she had been beset with a madness for writing notes which she addressed to Seth.He had found them concealed in his books at school and one had been given him by a child met in the street, while several had been delivered through the village post office."
"这些便条上的字迹圆润而孩子气，透露出作者在读完小说后所激起的热情。尽管一些用铅笔潦草地写在银行家妻子的信笺上的句子打动并愉悦了塞斯，但他却没有回信。他将信放进外衣口袋里，然后穿过街道或是站在学校操场的围栏边，心里激情澎湃。他觉得自己竟被这镇上最有钱、最可爱的姑娘看上真是太好了。","The notes had been written in a round, boyish hand and had reflected a mind inflamed by novel reading.Seth had not answered them, although he had been moved and flattered by some of the sentences scrawled in pencil upon the stationery of the banker’s wife.Putting them into the pocket of his coat, he went through the street or stood by the fence in the school yard with something burning at his side.He thought it fine that he should be thus selected as the favorite of the richest and most attractive girl in town."
"海伦和塞斯在围栏边停了下来，旁边一座低矮阴暗的建筑物正对着大街。这座建筑曾经是用来制作桶板的工厂，可现在却是空荡荡的。街对面一所房子的门廊上，一对男女谈着童年趣事，声音清楚地传进这对有些羞窘的年轻人耳中。接着传来了椅子摩擦的声音，那对男女走下了碎石小径，来到了木门前。那名男子站在门外倾过身亲吻了女人。“为了旧日时光。”他说着，然后转过身，沿着人行道快步地走了。","Helen and Seth stopped by a fence near where a low dark building faced the street.The building had once been a factory for the making of barrel staves but was now vacant.Across the street upon the porch of a house a man and woman talked of their childhood, their voices coming dearly across to the half-embarrassed youth and maiden.There was the sound of scraping chairs and the man and woman came down the gravel path to a wooden gate.Standing outside the gate, the man leaned over and kissed the woman.“For old times’ sake,” he said and, turning, walked rapidly away along the sidewalk."
"“那是贝拉·特纳，”海伦小声说，大胆地将自己的手放进塞斯的手中。“我原先不知道她有情人。我想她已经太老，过了那个年龄。”塞斯不安地笑了。女孩子的手很温暖，一种奇怪而晕眩的感觉传遍了他的全身。他脑子里有种欲望，想要对她说点儿他曾经决心不对她说的话。“乔治·威拉德爱上了你。”他说，尽管他心烦意乱，声音却是低沉而平静的。“他在写一个故事，因此想谈一场恋爱。他想感受一下爱情。他让我告诉你，看看你怎么说。”","“That’s Belle Turner,” whispered Helen, and put her hand boldly into Seth’s hand.“I didn’t know she had a fellow.I thought she was too old for that.”Seth laughed uneasily.The hand of the girl was warm and a strange, dizzy feeling crept over him.Into his mind came a desire to tell her something he had been determined not to tell.“George Willard’s in love with you,” he said, and in spite of his agitation his voice was low and quiet.“He’s writing a story, and he wants to be in love.He wants to know how it feels.He wanted me to tell you and see what you said.”"
"海伦和塞斯再一次沉默地走着。他们来到老里士满房子附近的花园，穿过树篱中的一个豁口，在灌木丛下的一条木头长凳上坐了下来。","Again Helen and Seth walked in silence.They came to the garden surrounding the old Richmond place and going through a gap in the hedge sat on a wooden bench beneath a bush."
"当他在街上同身边的少女同行的时候，塞斯·里士满的脑海里浮现出了新鲜而大胆的想法。他开始懊悔自己打算离开小镇的决定。“留下来，并时常同海伦·怀特一起在街上散步将会是一件新鲜又十分令人快乐的事。”他想。他在幻想中看见自己搂着她的腰，感觉她的双臂紧紧地环在他的脖子上。这些事件和地点奇怪地组合在一起，使他将与这个姑娘相爱和前些天去过的一个地方联系在了一起。有一次，他到一个农夫的家里去办事，那个人住在集市广场那头的山坡上。返回的时候，他经过一条横穿田野的小径。在那个农夫房子下面的山脚下，塞斯曾在一棵梧桐树下停留，寻找他。一阵轻柔的哼鸣声传入他的耳中。一时间，他以为树里面一定有一群蜜蜂在此安家。","On the street as he walked beside the girl new and daring thoughts had come into Seth Richmond’s mind.He began to regret his decision to get out of town.“It would be something new and altogether delightful to remain and walk often through the streets with Helen White,” he thought.In imagination he saw himself putting his arm about her waist and feeling her arms clasped tightly about his neck.One of those odd combinations of events and places made him connect the idea of love-making with this girl and a spot he had visited some days before.He had gone on an errand to the house of a farmer who lived on a hillside beyond the Fair Ground and had returned by a path through a field.At the foot of the hill below the farmer’s house Seth had stopped beneath a sycamore tree and looked about him.A soft humming noise had greeted his ears.For a moment he had thought the tree must be the home of a swarm of bees."
"接着，塞斯往下望去，看到蜜蜂在他周围长长的草丛里到处飞来飞去。他站在田地上密密层层的杂草间，那些草从山坡上一路绵延而下，高及人腰。草丛里开出紫色的小花，散发出阵阵袭人的芬芳。草丛上蜜蜂成群结对，嗡嗡地飞着采蜜。","And then, looking down, Seth had seen the bees everywhere all about him in the long grass.He stood in a mass of weeds that grew waist-high in the field that ran away from the hillside.The weeds were abloom with tiny purple blossoms and gave forth an overpowering fragrance.Upon the weeds the bees were gathered in armies, singing as they worked."
"塞斯幻想自己在夏天的傍晚躺在树下浓密的草丛中。在这幅幻想出的景象里，海伦·怀特躺在他身边，手放在他的手里。一种奇怪的厌恶情绪使他没有去亲吻她，可他认为，如果他想的话也许可以那样做。可是，他纹丝不动地躺在那里，望着她，耳边听着成群的蜜蜂在他头上哼唱那经年不断的、精彩的劳动之歌。","Seth imagined himself lying on a summer evening, buried deep among the weeds beneath the tree.Beside him, in the scene built in his fancy, lay Helen White, her hand lying in his hand.A peculiar reluctance kept him from kissing her lips, but he felt he might have done that if he wished.Instead, he lay perfectly still, looking at her and listening to the army of bees that sang the sustained masterful song of labor above his head."
"塞斯在花园里的长凳上躁动不安。他松开了海伦的手，将双手插进自己的裤袋里。有种欲望涌上他的心头——他要向他的同伴印证自己刚才做的决定是多么重大。于是，他朝房子点点头。“我想妈妈会大惊小怪的。”他低声说，“她从没想过我将来会干什么。她认为我永远会呆在这儿，只做个孩子。”","On the bench in the garden Seth stirred uneasily.Releasing the hand of the girl, he thrust his hands into his trouser pockets.A desire to impress the mind of his companion with the importance of the resolution he had made came over him and he nodded his head toward the house.“Mother’ll make a fuss, I suppose,” he whispered.“She hasn’t thought at all about what I’m going to do in life.She thinks I’m going to stay on here forever just being a boy.”"
"塞斯的声音充满了孩子气的一本正经。“你知道，我得独立去闯。我得去工作。那就是我擅长的事情。”","Seth’s voice became charged with boyish earnestness.“You see, I’ve got to strike out.I’ve got to get to work.It’s what I’m good for.”"
"海伦·怀特被打动了。她点点头，钦佩之情油然而生。“就该这样。”她想，“这个少年根本不是个孩子，而是一个坚强、有志气的男人。”曾经占据她心灵的某种朦胧的欲望被一扫而光。她挺直身子，坐在长凳上。雷声不断轰鸣，一道道明亮的闪电照亮了东面的天空。这个曾经是如此神秘而辽阔的花园，这个本来可能会因为有赛斯在她身边而变成某种奇妙冒险的绝佳之地，现在看上去却和温斯堡的所有平淡无奇的后花园一样，界垒分明。","Helen White was impressed.She nodded her head and a feeling of admiration swept over her.“This is as it should be,” she thought.“This boy is not a boy at all, but a strong, purposeful man.”Certain vague desires that had been invading her body were swept away and she sat up very straight on the bench.The thunder continued to rumble and flashes of heat lightning lit up the eastern sky.The garden that had been so mysterious and vast, a place that with Seth beside her might have become the background for strange and wonderful adventures, now seemed no more than an ordinary Winesburg back yard, quite definite and limited in its outlines."
"“你会在那里做什么呢？”她小声说。","“What will you do up there?” she whispered."
"塞斯在长凳上侧过半身，尽力在黑暗中看清她的脸。他觉得她比乔治·威拉德更理智、更坦诚。他很庆幸自己离开了那位朋友。对小镇居民的那种厌烦之情又被记起，他试着告诉她：“人人都在说话、说话。”他开始说道，“我对此感到厌倦。我要做一种与说话没什么重大关系的工作。或许，我会到某个店里做机械师。我也不知道。我想，我并不很在意。我就想工作，保持安静。这就是我所想的。”","Seth turned half around on the bench, striving to see her face in the darkness.He thought her infinitely more sensible and straightforward than George Willard, and was glad he had come away from his friend.A feeling of impatience with the town that had been in his mind returned, and he tried to tell her of it.“Everyone talks and talks,” he began.“I’m sick of it.I’ll do something, get into some kind of work where talk don’t count.Maybe I’ll just be a mechanic in a shop.I don’t know.I guess I don’t care much.I just want to work and keep quiet.That’s all I’ve got in my mind.”"
"塞斯从长凳上站起来，伸出手。他不想结束谈话，可也想不出别的可说的。“这是我们最后一次见面了。”他低声说。","Seth arose from the bench and put out his hand.He did not want to bring the meeting to an end but could not think of anything more to say.“It’s the last time we’ll see each other,” he whispered."
"一阵伤感席上海伦的心头。她把手放在塞斯肩上，开始将他的脸拉下来对着自己仰着的脸。这个动作完全出于爱慕，也是一种令人心伤的遗憾，原本会发生在今夜暧昧气氛中的某种冒险如今再也不能实现了。“我想我得回去了。”她说，手猛地垂到身体一侧。她脑海中冒出一个念头。“你别跟着我，我想一个人。”她说道，“你回去同你妈妈谈谈。你最好现在就去。”塞斯犹豫着，他站在那里等着的时候，女孩子转过身从篱笆里穿出去跑了。他想去追她，可他只是站在那里看着，对她的举动感到困惑不解，就像他曾对她所在的这个小镇上的其他事感到困惑不解一样。他慢慢地朝房子走去，停在一棵大树的树阴下，看着他的母亲坐在一扇亮着灯光的窗边正忙着缝缝补补。今晚早些时候他曾感到的那种孤独再次来袭，也影响了他对刚刚所经历的那次历险的看法。“嘿！”他大喊一声，转过身看着海伦·怀特走的方向。“那就是事情最后会变成的样子。她会和其他人一样。我想，她会开始用一种可笑的方式来看待我。”他看着地面，反复考虑着这个想法。“当我在她周围的时候，她会觉得尴尬和奇怪。”他低声自语道，“会变成那样的。每件事都会变成那样。她会爱上某个人，可永远都不会是我。那会是其他的人——某个傻瓜——某个夸夸其谈的人——像乔治·威拉德那样的人。”","A wave of sentiment swept over Helen.Putting her hand upon Seth’s shoulder, she started to draw his face down toward her own upturned face.The act was one of pure affection and cutting regret that some vague adventure that had been present in the spirit of the night would now never be realized.“I think I’d better be going along,” she said, letting her hand fall heavily to her side.A thought came to her.“Don’t you go with me; I want to be alone,” she said.“You go and talk with your mother.You’d better do that now.”Seth hesitated and, as he stood waiting, the girl turned and ran away through the hedge.A desire to run after her came to him, but he only stood staring, perplexed and puzzled by her action as he had been perplexed and puzzled by all of the life of the town out of which she had come.Walking slowly toward the house, he stopped in the shadow of a large tree and looked at his mother sitting by a lighted window busily sewing.The feeling of loneliness that had visited him earlier in the evening returned and colored his thoughts of the adventure through which he had just passed.“Huh!” he exclaimed, turning and staring in the direction taken by Helen White.“That’s how things’ll turn out.She’ll be like the rest.I suppose she’ll begin now to look at me in a funny way.”He looked at the ground and pondered this thought.“She’ll be embarrassed and feel strange when I’m around,” he whispered to himself.“That’s how it’ll be.That’s how everything’ll turn out.When it comes to loving someone, it won’t never be me.It’ll be someone else—some fool—someone who talks a lot—someone like that George Willard.”"
"第十一章 坦迪","Chapter 11 Tandy"
"七岁前，她一直住在一座未经粉刷的老房子里，房子坐落于通往特鲁连山峰的一条荒凉的道路上。她的父亲没给予她多少疼爱，她的母亲也过世了。那位父亲将时间都用来谈论和思考宗教了。他宣称自己是个不可知论者，并且专心于消灭那些悄悄进入他邻居们头脑中的上帝思想，如此专心以至于他从未发现上帝在这个小女孩身上显灵。小女孩几乎已被遗忘，四处漂泊不定的，靠她已故母亲的亲戚们的善心过活。","Until she was seven years old she lived in an old unpainted house on an unused road that led off Trunion Pike.Her father gave her but little attention and her mother was dead.The father spent his time talking and thinking of religion.He proclaimed himself an agnostic and was so absorbed in destroying the ideas of God that had crept into the minds of his neighbors that he never saw God manifesting himself in the little child that, half forgotten, lived here and there on the bounty of her dead mother’s relatives."
"一个外乡人来到温斯堡，在这孩子身上看到了她父亲没有发现的东西。他是个高大的红头发青年，总是喝得醉醺醺的。有时，他同那位名叫汤姆·哈德的父亲坐在新威拉德旅社前面的一张椅子上。当汤姆高谈阔论，宣称上帝可能并不存在的时候，他就微微一笑，朝旁边的人眨眨眼睛。他和汤姆成了朋友，经常呆在一起。","A stranger came to Winesburg and saw in the child what the father did not see.He was a tall, red-haired young man who was almost always drunk.Sometimes he sat in a chair before the New Willard House with Tom Hard, the father.As Tom talked, declaring there could be no God, the stranger smiled and winked at the bystanders.He and Tom became friends and were much together."
"这位外乡人是克利夫兰的一个富商的儿子，来温斯堡是为了一个目的。他希望能改掉嗜酒的坏习惯，并认为逃离城市的社交生活，住在乡村里，会比较有可能改掉这个正在毁掉他的嗜好。","The stranger was the son of a rich merchant of Cleveland and had come to Winesburg on a mission.He wanted to cure himself of the habit of drink, and thought that by escaping from his city associates and living in a rural community he would have a better chance in the struggle with the appetite that was destroying him."
"他暂居温斯堡的生活不算成功。乏味的生活使他比以前喝得更厉害。但是，他也做成了一件事。他给汤姆·哈德的女儿起了一个饱含深意的名字。","His sojourn in Winesburg was not a success.The dullness of the passing hours led to his drinking harder than ever.But he did succeed in doing something.He gave a name rich with meaning to Tom Hard’s daughter."
"一个傍晚，这个外乡人从长时间的迷醉中清醒过来，沿着小镇的大街踉跄着往回走。汤姆·哈德坐在新威拉德旅社前的一张椅子里，他五岁的女儿坐在他的腿上。年轻的乔治·威拉德坐在他旁边的人行道路面上。这位外乡人倒在他们旁边的一张扶椅上。他的身体在颤抖，说话的时候声音也在发抖。","One evening when he was recovering from a long debauch the stranger came reeling along the main street of the town.Tom Hard sat in a chair before the New Willard House with his daughter, then a child of five, on his knees.Beside him on the board sidewalk sat young George Willard.The stranger dropped into a chair beside them.His body shook and when he tried to talk his voice trembled."
"夜已经深了，黑暗笼罩着小镇和旅社前那条沿着小山坡的底部铺设的铁路。远处，一列开往西部客车的汽笛发出一声长鸣。一条躺在路面上睡觉的狗被吵醒了，汪汪地大叫起来。外乡人开始瞎侃，对躺在那位不可知论者怀里的小孩做了一番预言。","It was late evening and darkness lay over the town and over the railroad that ran along the foot of a little incline before the hotel.Somewhere in the distance, off to the west, there was a prolonged blast from the whistle of a passenger engine.A dog that had been sleeping in the roadway arose and barked.The stranger began to babble and made a prophecy concerning the child that lay in the arms of the agnostic."
"“我是来这儿戒酒的。”他说，泪水开始从脸颊上流下来。他没有去看汤姆·哈德，而是向前倾着身体，凝视着夜色，仿佛在看着什么幻境。“我跑到乡下是来治病的，可是没治好。这是有原因的。”他转过头望着笔直地坐在父亲膝上的小女孩，她也回望着他。","“I came here to quit drinking,” he said, and tears began to run down his cheeks.He did not look at Tom Hard, but leaned forward and stared into the darkness as though seeing a vision.“I ran away to the country to be cured, but I am not cured.There is a reason.”He turned to look at the child who sat up very straight on her father’s knee and returned the look."
"这个外乡人拍拍汤姆·哈德的胳膊。“喝酒不是我唯一上瘾的事，”他说，“还有别的东西。我是个多情的人，可还没找到我所爱的东西。这一点很重要，如果你能完全理解我的意思。你看，这使得我的毁灭不可避免。但没人明白这些。”","The stranger touched Tom Hard on the arm.“Drink is not the only thing to which I am addicted,” he said.“There is something else.I am a lover and have not found my thing to love.That is a big point if you know enough to realize what I mean.It makes my destruction inevitable, you see.There are few who understand that.”"
"这位外乡人沉默下来，似乎被悲伤给击倒了，然而，客车汽笛发出的又一次长鸣将他惊醒。“我还没有失去信仰。我声明。我只是被扔到了一个我知道我的信仰不会被实现的地方。”他声嘶力竭地大叫道。他不再管那位父亲，而是紧紧地盯着孩子，开始对她说起话来。“有个女人出现了，”他说，声音立刻变得尖锐又热切。“你看，我错过了她。她没在我的时代出现。你也许就是那个女人。就好像是命运让我有一次机会站在她面前，在这样的一个傍晚，我已经用酒精把自己毁掉，而她却还只是个小孩子。”","The stranger became silent and seemed overcome with sadness, but another blast from the whistle of the passenger engine aroused him.“I have not lost faith.I proclaim that.I have only been brought to the place where I know my faith will not be realized,” he declared hoarsely.He looked hard at the child and began to address her, paying no more attention to the father.“There is a woman coming,” he said, and his voice was now sharp and earnest.“I have missed her, you see.She did not come in my time.You may be the woman.It would be like fate to let me stand in her presence once, on such an evening as this, when I have destroyed myself with drink and she is as yet only a child.”"
"这位外乡人的双肩剧烈地抖动着。他试图卷起一根烟，可烟纸却从他颤抖着的指间掉下去了。他变得有些恼怒，大骂起来。“他们觉得做女人、被人爱是件容易的事情，可我懂得更透彻。”他说道。他再一次转向小女孩。“我懂，”他叫着，“也许所有的男人中只有我懂。”","The shoulders of the stranger shook violently, and when he tried to roll a cigarette the paper fell from his trembling fingers.He grew angry and scolded.“They think it’s easy to be a woman, to be loved, but I know better,” he declared.Again he turned to the child.“I understand,” he cried.“Perhaps of all men I alone understand.”"
"他的眼神又飘向了夜色深深的街道。“我懂她，尽管她从没遇见过我。”他轻柔地说，“我明白她的奋斗和失败。就是因为她的失败，她对我而言才是个可爱的人。从她的失败中衍生出一种女性的新品质。我给它起了个名字。我叫它坦迪。我想到这个名字时还是个虔诚的梦想家，身体也还没变坏。这是一种勇于被爱的坚强品质。这是男人需要从女人身上获得、但却无法获得的品质。”这位外乡人起身，站在汤姆·哈德面前。他的身躯前后摇晃着，看上去就要摔倒了，可相反，他在人行道上跪下来，将小女孩的双手捧到自己醉醺醺的唇边。他痴迷地吻着这双手。“做坦迪吧，小家伙，”他恳求着，“你要坚强、勇敢。那才是你的路。勇敢面对一切。勇敢地去被爱。要胜于寻常男女。做坦迪吧。”","His glance again wandered away to the darkened street.“I know about her, although she has never crossed my path,” he said softly.“I know about her struggles and her defeats.It is because of her defeats that she is to me the lovely one.Out of her defeats has been born a new quality in woman.I have a name for it.I call it Tandy.I made up the name when I was a true dreamer and before my body became vile.It is the quality of being strong to be loved.It is something men need from women and that they do not get.’The stranger arose and stood before Tom Hard.His body rocked back and forth and he seemed about to fall, but instead he dropped to his knees on the sidewalk and raised the hands of the little girl to his drunken lips.He kissed them ecstatically.“Be Tandy, little one,” he pleaded.“Dare to be strong and courageous.That is the road.Venture anything.Be brave enough to dare to be loved.Be something more than man or woman.Be Tandy.”"
"外乡人站了起来，沿着街道跌跌撞撞地走了。一两天之后，他登上了一辆火车，返回了自己的故乡克利夫兰。在旅社前的那场谈话结束后的一个夏夜，汤姆·哈德将女儿送到一个亲戚家，他们邀请小女孩去过夜。他黑夜里走在树下的时候，早已忘记了那位异乡人滔滔不绝的话语，脑袋里又开始想着如何组织观点去摧毁人们心中对上帝的笃信。他叫女儿的名字，可她开始哭起来。","The stranger arose and staggered off down the street.A day or two later he got aboard a train and returned to his home in Cleveland.On the summer evening, after the talk before the hotel, Tom Hard took the girl child to the house of a relative where she had been invited to spend the night.As he went along in the darkness under the trees he forgot the babbling voice of the stranger and his mind returned to the making of arguments by which he might destroy men’s faith in God.He spoke his daughter’s name and she began to weep."
"“我不想叫那个，”她说道，“我想叫坦迪——坦迪·哈德。”小女孩哭得如此伤心，触动了汤姆·哈德，他试着安慰她。他抱着女儿停在一棵树下，开始安抚她。“现在乖一点儿。”他厉声说，可是小女孩不愿安静下来。她孩子气地任性起来，伤心地嚎啕大哭，声音打破了夜晚街上的宁静。“我要叫坦迪。我要叫坦迪。我要叫坦迪·哈德。”她喊着，摇着头，哭泣着，仿佛年幼的力量还不足以承担那个醉汉的话带给她的幻境。","“I don’t want to be called that,” she declared.“I want to be called Tandy—Tandy Hard.”The child wept so bitterly that Tom Hard was touched and tried to comfort her.He stopped beneath a tree and, taking her into his arms, began to caress her.“Be good, now,” he said sharply; but she would not be quieted.With childish abandon she gave herself over to grief, her voice breaking the evening stillness of the street.“I want to be Tandy.I want to be Tandy.I want to be Tandy Hard,” she cried, shaking her head and sobbing as though her young strength were not enough to bear the vision the words of the drunkard had brought to her."
"第十二章 上帝的力量","Chapter 12 The Strength Of God"
"受人尊敬的柯蒂斯·哈特曼是温斯堡基督教长老会的一名牧师，他任职已经有十年了。他四十岁，天性极为沉默寡言。对他而言，站在讲坛上面对众人布道永远是件苦差。因此，从周三清晨到周六傍晚，他只想着周日必须要做的两场布道。周日一大早，他就到教堂钟楼里一间名为书房的小房间里去祈祷。在他的祷告词中，有一条总是占主导地位。“哦，上帝啊，请赐予我力量与勇气来为你服务吧！”他跪在没铺地毯的地板上，低着头，为即将开始的使命殷殷恳求着。","The reverend Curtis Hartman was pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Winesburg, and had been in that position ten years.He was forty years old, and by his nature very silent and reticent.To preach, standing in the pulpit before the people, was always a hardship for him and from Wednesday morning until Saturday evening he thought of nothing but the two sermons that must be preached on Sunday.Early on Sunday morning he went into a little room called a study in the bell tower of the church and prayed.In his prayers there was one note that always predominated.“Give me strength and courage for Thy work, O Lord!” he pleaded, kneeling on the bare floor and bowing his head in the presence of the task that lay before him."
"哈特曼牧师个子很高，留着棕色的胡子。他的妻子是个神经兮兮的胖女人。她是俄亥俄州克利夫兰的一个内衣制造商的女儿。牧师本人在镇上非常受人喜爱。教会长老们喜欢他，因为他安静谦恭。银行家的妻子怀特太太则认为他博学而优雅。","The Reverend Hartman was a tall man with a brown beard.His wife, a stout, nervous woman, was the daughter of a manufacturer of underwear at Cleveland, Ohio.The minister himself was rather a favorite in the town.The elders of the church liked him because he was quiet and unpretentious and Mrs. White, the banker’s wife, thought him scholarly and refined."
"基督教长老会与温斯堡其他教会相比而言，保持着较为清高的地位。基督教长老会规模更大、气势更宏伟，牧师的薪水也更高。牧师甚至有自己的马车；在夏天的傍晚，有时他会同妻子驾车在镇里四处逛逛。他穿过大街，往来于七叶树街上，庄重地向人们鞠躬；而他的妻子则暗藏得意、异常激动，一面从眼角的余光中望着他，一面还在担心若是马惊了会脱缰跑了。","The Presbyterian Church held itself somewhat aloof from the other churches of Winesburg.It was larger and more imposing and its minister was better paid.He even had a carriage of his own and on summer evenings sometimes drove about town with his wife.Through Main Street and up and down Buckeye Street he went, bowing gravely to the people, while his wife, afire with secret pride, looked at him out of the corners of her eyes and worried lest the horse become frightened and run away."
"自柯蒂斯·哈特曼来到温斯堡，多年来一直诸事顺利。在他供职的教堂里，他不属于那种能让信徒们产生狂热的人，但另一方面，他也从不树敌。事实上，他非常虔诚，有时，因为不能去镇上大街小巷高唱上帝福音而悔恨很长时间。他很疑惑圣灵之火是否真的在他内心燃烧；他还梦想着那么一天，一股强大而温柔的崭新力量会像一阵大风吹进他的声音和灵魂。那时，人们会因上帝在他身上显灵而颤抖。“我是个可怜的家伙，那种事永远不会发生在我身上。”他沮丧地沉思着，接着，忍耐的微笑浮上嘴角。“哦，那么，我想我做得够多了。”他冷静地补充了一句。","For a good many years after he came to Winesburg things went well with Curtis Hartman.He was not one to arouse keen enthusiasm among the worshippers in his church but on the other hand he made no enemies.In reality he was much in earnest and sometimes suffered prolonged periods of remorse because he could not go crying the word of God in the highways and byways of the town.He wondered if the flame of the spirit really burned in him and dreamed of a day when a strong sweet new current of power would come like a great wind into his voice and his soul and the people would tremble before the spirit of God made manifest in him.“I am a poor stick and that will never really happen to me,” he mused dejectedly, and then a patient smile lit up his features.“Oh well, I suppose I’m doing well enough,” he added philosophically."
"每周日清晨，牧师都去教堂钟楼的房间祈求上帝赐予他更多的神力。那个房间只有一扇窗户。窗子狭长，像门一样倚着合叶向外开着。窗户是由若干小块的镶铅框的窗玻璃组成，上面画有一幅图案：基督将手放在一个孩子头上。夏日里一个周日的清晨，他坐在房间的书桌旁，面前摊开着一本很大的《圣经》，几张布道板散落在旁边。就在此时，他吃惊地发现，在隔壁房子楼上的房间里，一个女人躺在床上边抽烟边看书。柯蒂斯·哈特曼踮着脚来到窗边，轻轻地关上了窗户。他一想到女人居然抽烟就觉得恐怖万状，再想到自己刚刚从《圣经》上抬起眼就看到了一个女人裸露的肩膀和雪白的脖颈，不由得浑身发抖。他的头脑里混乱一片，于是他下楼来到讲坛上做了一个长长的布道，根本没考虑自己的姿势或者声音。这次布道因为清楚有力而引起了不同寻常的关注。“我想知道她是否在听，我的话是否给她的灵魂带去了启示。”他这样想着，开始希望在以后的周日清晨能够用自己的言辞感染她，让这位显然深陷于隐秘罪恶的女人清醒过来。","The room in the bell tower of the church, where on Sunday mornings the minister prayed for an increase in him of the power of God, had but one window.It was long and narrow and swung outward on a hinge like a door.On the window, made of little leaded panes, was a design showing the Christ laying his hand upon the head of a child.One Sunday morning in the summer as he sat by his desk in the room with a large Bible opened before him, and the sheets of his sermon scattered about, the minister was shocked to see, in the upper room of the house next door, a woman lying in her bed and smoking a cigarette while she read a book.Curtis Hartman went on tiptoe to the window and closed it softly.He was horror stricken at the thought of a woman smoking and trembled also to think that his eyes, just raised from the pages of the book of God, had looked upon the bare shoulders and white throat of a woman.With his brain in a whirl he went down into the pulpit and preached a long sermon without once thinking of his gestures or his voice.The sermon attracted unusual attention because of its power and clearness.“I wonder if she is listening, if my voice is carrying a message into her soul,” he thought and began to hope that on future Sunday mornings he might be able to say words that would touch and awaken the woman apparently far gone in secret sin."
"牧师从窗子里看到令他如此懊恼景象的那座房子紧挨着基督教长老会教堂，现在里面住着两位女士。伊丽莎白·斯威夫特阿姨是一位寡妇。她头发花白，样子很精干，在温斯堡国家银行里有存款。与她同住的是她的女儿凯特·斯威夫特，是一位教师。这位老师有三十岁了，她身材匀称，看起来整洁利落。她没有几个朋友，出了名的说话刻薄。柯蒂斯·哈特曼开始琢磨她，记起来她曾去过欧洲，还在纽约市住过两年。“或许她抽烟根本不算什么。”他想。他记起自己在大学时偶尔也读些小说，有一次落在他手中的一本书里面就连续好多页描写了善良却有些世俗的女子也会抽烟。于是，他怀着一番新的决心，一整周都在致力于他的布道。在一心想要打动那位新听众的耳朵和灵魂的热忱中，他将在讲坛上的困窘与周日清晨在书房里必做的祷告统统忘记了。","The house next door to the Presbyterian Church, through the windows of which the minister had seen the sight that had so upset him, was occupied by two women.Aunt Elizabeth Swift, a grey competent-looking widow with money in the Winesburg National Bank, lived there with her daughter Kate Swift, a school teacher.The school teacher was thirty years old and had a neat trim-looking figure.She had few friends and bore a reputation of having a sharp tongue.When he began to think about her, Curtis Hartman remembered that she had been to Europe and had lived for two years in New York City.“Perhaps after all her smoking means nothing,” he thought.He began to remember that when he was a student in college and occasionally read novels, good although somewhat worldly women, had smoked through the pages of a book that had once fallen into his hands.With a rush of new determination he worked on his sermons all through the week and forgot, in his zeal to reach the ears and the soul of this new listener, both his embarrassment in the pulpit and the necessity of prayer in the study on Sunday mornings."
"哈特曼牧师对女人的经验终究是有限的。他是印第安纳州曼西市一名马车匠的儿子，半工半读完成了大学学业。在他读书期间，内衣制造厂商的女儿和他分租一套房子。在经历了一番正式而漫长的求爱过程后，他同她结了婚，而求爱的过程大部分都是那个姑娘自己安排的。结婚当天，内衣制造商给了他的女儿五千美金作为嫁妆，并承诺在他的遗嘱里至少会留给她两倍于这个数额的钱。牧师认为自己的婚姻是幸运的，从不允许自己想其他女人。他也不愿意想其他女人。他就想安静虔诚地做好这份神职工作。","Reverend Hartman’s experience with women had been somewhat limited.He was the son of a wagon maker from Muncie, Indiana, and had worked his way through college.The daughter of the underwear manufacturer had boarded in a house where he lived during his school days and he had married her after a formal and prolonged courtship, carried on for the most part by the girl herself.On his marriage day the underwear manufacturer had given his daughter five thousand dollars and he promised to leave her at least twice that amount in his will.The minister had thought himself fortunate in marriage and had never permitted himself to think of other women.He did not want to think of other women.What he wanted was to do the work of God quietly and earnestly."
"牧师心里激起了一场斗争。从希望自己的布道能传达到凯特·斯威夫特的耳朵里，以便触及她的灵魂，到也开始想再看一眼那静静地躺在床上的雪白的身体。一个周日的清晨，他因为胡思乱想睡不着，便起身到街上去散步。当他沿着大街快走到老里士满房子的时候，他停了下来，从地上拾起一块石头，快步向钟楼的房间赶去。他用石头打破了窗户的一角，然后锁上门，坐在书桌旁，对着摊开的《圣经》等待着。当凯特·斯威夫特房间的窗帘被拉起来的时候，他可以透过那个洞望见她的床，可她并不在那儿。她也起床出去散步了，那只拉窗帘的手是伊丽莎白·斯威夫特阿姨的。","In the soul of the minister a struggle awoke.From wanting to reach the ears of Kate Swift, and through his sermons to delve into her soul, he began to want also to look again at the figure lying white and quiet in the bed.On a Sunday morning when he could not sleep because of his thoughts he arose and went to walk in the streets.When he had gone along Main Street almost to the old Richmond place he stopped and picking up a stone rushed off to the room in the bell tower.With the stone he broke out a corner of the window and then locked the door and sat down at the desk before the open Bible to wait.When the shade of the window to Kate Swift’s room was raised he could see, through the hole, directly into her bed, but she was not there.She also had arisen and had gone for a walk and the hand that raised the shade was the hand of Aunt Elizabeth Swift."
"得以从这“偷窥”的肉欲中解脱出来使这位牧师几乎喜极而泣，于是他回到自己的房子里歌颂上帝。然而，他心慌意乱之际却忘了将窗户上的洞填起来。那块从窗子角落被敲下来的玻璃正好是图案上那个静静站在上帝面前、满怀喜悦地望着基督面容的孩子赤裸的脚后跟。","The minister almost wept with joy at this deliverance from the carnal desire to “peep” and went back to his own house praising God.In an ill moment he forgot, however, to stop the hole in the window.The piece of glass broken out at the corner of the window just nipped off the bare heel of the boy standing motionless and looking with rapt eyes into the face of the Christ."
"柯蒂斯·哈特曼忘记了那个周日早晨的布道。他同他的会众交谈。在谈话中他说，人们认为牧师是另一类人，天生过着清白无过错的生活，这种想法是错误的。“从我的亲身经历中，我了解到，我们这些上帝教义的使徒也会受到那些烦扰你们的诱惑的困扰。”他郑重地说，“我就受过诱惑，并屈从于它。只有上帝之手托住我的头，才使我得以超脱。正如他使我解脱一样，他也会使你们得到解脱。不要灰心。在你们犯罪的时候抬头望向上苍，你们将会一再地得到拯救。”","Curtis Hartman forgot his sermon on that Sunday morning.He talked to his congregation and in his talk said that it was a mistake for people to think of their minister as a man set aside and intended by nature to lead a blameless life.“Out of my own experience I know that we, who are the ministers of God’s word, are beset by the same temptations that assail you,” he declared.“I have been tempted and have surrendered to temptation.It is only the hand of God, placed beneath my head, that has raised me up.As he has raised me so also will he raise you.Do not despair.In your hour of sin raise your eyes to the skies and you will be again and again saved.”"
"牧师毅然地将床上女人的念头从脑海中摒弃了，并开始在妻子面前表现得像一个爱人。一天晚上，他们一同驾车外出，他将马车赶出七叶树街。在福音山上，俯瞰着水库池塘，他在黑暗中搂住了萨拉·哈特曼的腰。早上他吃过早饭，准备回房子后面的书房时，他绕过餐桌，吻了妻子的脸颊。每当关于凯特·斯威夫特的念头出现，他便微笑着抬头望天。“主啊，请您宽恕我，”他喃喃自语道，“让我坚守在一心为您服务的小径上吧。”","Resolutely the minister put the thoughts of the woman in the bed out of his mind and began to be something like a lover in the presence of his wife.One evening when they drove out together he turned the horse out of Buckeye Street and in the darkness on Gospel Hill, above Waterworks Pond, put his arm about Sarah Hartman’s waist.When he had eaten breakfast in the morning and was ready to retire to his study at the back of his house he went around the table and kissed his wife on the cheek.When thoughts of Kate Swift came into his head, he smiled and raised his eyes to the skies.“Intercede for me, Master,” he muttered, “keep me in the narrow path intent on Thy work.”"
"现在，这位棕色胡子的牧师心里开始了真正的挣扎。他偶然发现凯特·斯威夫特习惯在夜里躺在床上看书。床边的书桌上立着一盏灯，灯光倾泻在她雪白的肩膀和裸露的脖子上。发现这个景象的夜晚，牧师在满是灰尘的房间的书桌边从九点一直坐到十一点多。直到她熄了灯，他才蹒跚地走出教堂，又花了两个多小时到街上散步和祈祷。他并不想去亲吻凯特·斯威夫特的肩膀和脖子，他也不允许自己动那样的念头。他也不知道自己想要什么。“我是上帝的孩子，他必定能把我从自我堕落中解救出来的。”他在街上游荡时，站在树林下的阴影里大喊道。他站在一棵树旁，望着流云遮蔽的天空。他开始频繁而亲密地同上帝谈话。“天父啊，请你不要抛弃我。赐予我力量明天去修补那个窗洞吧。让我抬起头再次望向苍穹吧。请在你的仆人需要你的时候，与我同在。”","And now began the real struggle in the soul of the brown-bearded minister.By chance he discovered that Kate Swift was in the habit of lying in her bed in the evenings and reading a book.A lamp stood on a table by the side of the bed and the light streamed down upon her white shoulders and bare throat.On the evening when he made the discovery the minister sat at the desk in the dusty room from nine until after eleven and when her light was put out stumbled out of the church to spend two more hours walking and praying in the streets.He did not want to kiss the shoulders and the throat of Kate Swift and had not allowed his mind to dwell on such thoughts.He did not know what he wanted.“I am God’s child and he must save me from myself,” he cried, in the darkness under the trees as he wandered in the streets.By a tree he stood and looked at the sky that was covered with hurrying clouds.He began to talk to God intimately and closely.“Please, Father, do not forget me.Give me power to go tomorrow and repair the hole in the window.Lift my eyes again to the skies.Stay with me, Thy servant, in his hour of need.”"
"牧师在寂静的街上来来回回地走着，数日甚至数周以来，他的灵魂一直深受困扰。他无法理解这突如其来的诱惑，也弄不懂它到来的原因。他开始有些责怪上帝了，他对自己说他已经竭力回归正道，并未去追逐罪恶。“在我整个年轻的岁月里，以及我在这里的全部生活中，我都在安静地做我的工作。”他申述着，“为什么现在我应当受到诱惑呢？我究竟做错了什么，竟要承受这般罪责？”","Up and down through the silent streets walked the minister and for days and weeks his soul was troubled.He could not understand the temptation that had come to him nor could he fathom the reason for its coming.In a way he began to blame God, saying to himself that he had tried to keep his feet in the true path and had not run about seeking sin.“Through my days as a young man and all through my life here I have gone quietly about my work,” he declared.“Why now should I be tempted?What have I done that this burden should be laid on me?”"
"那年的初秋和冬天，柯蒂斯·哈特曼曾有三次从自己的房子偷偷出来，进入钟楼的房间，坐在黑暗中望着凯特·斯威夫特躺在床上的身体，然后到街上去散步和祷告。他无法理解自己。他可以好几个星期几乎不想那位教师，并且告诉自己已经战胜了偷窥她身体的情欲了。但是接下来就会有事发生。当他坐在自己房子的书房里，努力为布道做准备时，他会变得紧张，开始在房里走来走去。“我要到街上去。”他对自己说，但即使他使自己跨进了教堂大门，他仍会固执地否认他到此的理由。“我就不补窗户上的那个洞，我要训练自己晚上来这里，即使那个女人出现在面前也不会抬一下眼睛。我不会在这件事情上被打倒。上帝为考验我的灵魂而设计了这个诱惑，我会摸索着走出黑暗，找到正义的光明。”","Three times during the early fall and winter of that year Curtis Hartman crept out of his house to the room in the bell tower to sit in the darkness looking at the figure of Kate Swift lying in her bed and later went to walk and pray in the streets.He could not understand himself.For weeks he would go along scarcely thinking of the school teacher and telling himself that he had conquered the carnal desire to look at her body.And then something would happen.As he sat in the study of his own house, hard at work on a sermon, he would become nervous and begin to walk up and down the room.“I will go out into the streets,” he told himself and even as he let himself in at the church door he persistently denied to himself the cause of his being there.“I will not repair the hole in the window and I will train myself to come here at night and sit in the presence of this woman without raising my eyes.I will not be defeated in this thing.The Lord has devised this temptation as a test of my soul and I will grope my way out of darkness into the light of righteousness.”"
"一月的一个夜晚，天气严寒，温斯堡的街上有了厚厚的积雪。柯蒂斯·哈特曼最后一次造访教堂钟楼的那个房间。他离家的时候已过九点，他走得那样急，都忘了穿上套鞋。大街上空无一人，只有守夜人霍普·希金斯。除了守夜人和坐在《温斯堡鹰报》办公室里打算写篇报道的年轻人乔治·威拉德，全镇的人都已沉入了梦乡。牧师沿着街道前往教堂，他踏着积雪，向前跋涉，心里想着这次他将完全屈从于罪恶了。“我想去看看那个女人，幻想亲吻她的肩膀，让自己爱想什么就想什么。”他痛苦地宣布着，泪水涌上了眼眶。他开始考虑不再做牧师，试着从事其他的行业。“我应当到某个城市去从商。”他断言，“如果我天性如此，无法抵制罪恶，那么我就把自己交给罪恶吧。起码，我不会做个伪君子。我传道的同时，脑袋里却想着一个并不属于我的女人的肩膀和脖子。”","One night in January when it was bitter cold and snow lay deep on the streets of Winesburg Curtis Hartman paid his last visit to the room in the bell tower of the church.It was past nine o’clock when he left his own house and he set out so hurriedly that he forgot to put on his overshoes.In Main Street no one was abroad but Hop Higgins the night watchman and in the whole town no one was awake but the watchman and young George Willard, who sat in the office of the Winesburg Eagle trying to write a story.Along the street to the church went the minister, plowing through the drifts and thinking that this time he would utterly give way to sin.“I want to look at the woman and to think of kissing her shoulders and I am going to let myself think what I choose,” he declared bitterly and tears came into his eyes.He began to think that he would get out of the ministry and try some other way of life.“I shall go to some city and get into business,” he declared.“If my nature is such that I cannot resist sin, I shall give myself over to sin.At least I shall not be a hypocrite, preaching the word of God with my mind thinking of the shoulders and neck of a woman who does not belong to me.”"
"教堂钟楼的那个房间在一月的夜晚是极其寒冷的。几乎在他一踏进房间时就明白，如果呆在里面是会生病的。他的脚因踩过雪都湿了，而房间里也没有生火。而隔壁屋子的房间里，凯特·斯威夫特还没出现。这个男人怀着坚强的决心坐了下来，等待着。他坐在椅子里，抓着放《圣经》的书桌的边缘，凝视着夜色，想着他人生最黑暗的念头。他想起了自己的妻子，在这一刻，他几乎是恨她的。“她总以情欲为耻，还欺骗了我。”他想着，“男人有权利期望女人身上具有生动的激情和美丽。他不该忘记自己也是一种动物，我身上就有些希腊人的特质。我要抛弃这个属于我的女人，去追求其他的女人。我要追求这个女教师。我要公然违抗所有人；如果我是一个耽于肉欲的动物，那我就要为了自己的欲望而活。”","It was cold in the room of the bell tower of the church on that January night and almost as soon as he came into the room Curtis Hartman knew that if he stayed he would be ill.His feet were wet from tramping in the snow and there was no fire.In the room in the house next door Kate Swift had not yet appeared.With grim determination the man sat down to wait.Sitting in the chair and gripping the edge of the desk on which lay the Bible he stared into the darkness thinking the blackest thoughts of his life.He thought of his wife and for the moment almost hated her.“She has always been ashamed of passion and has cheated me,” he thought.“Man has a right to expect living passion and beauty in a woman.He has no right to forget that he is an animal and in me there is something that is Greek.I will throw off the woman of my bosom and seek other women.I will besiege this school teacher.I will fly in the face of all men and if I am a creature of carnal lusts I will live then for my lusts.”"
"这个心烦意乱的人从头到脚都在发抖，一半是因为寒冷，一半是因为他陷入了内心的挣扎。几小时过去了，他开始发烧。他的喉咙开始感到疼痛，牙齿也开始打颤。他的脚放在书房的地板上，冷得就像两块冰。他却还不愿放弃。“我要看看这个女人，然后想想我从来不敢想的事。”他对自己说，一边抓紧了桌角等待着。","The distracted man trembled from head to foot, partly from cold, partly from the struggle in which he was engaged.Hours passed and a fever assailed his body.His throat began to hurt and his teeth chattered.His feet on the study floor felt like two cakes of ice.Still he would not give up.“I will see this woman and will think the thoughts I have never dared to think,” he told himself, gripping the edge of the desk and waiting."
"那个夜晚在教堂的等待使柯蒂斯·哈特曼差点被冻死，但从发生过的事情中，他也发现了自己所认可的生活方式。在他之前等候的夜晚里，透过玻璃上的小洞，除了女老师的床，他没有注意到房间里任何其他的东西。他在黑暗中等待着，直到这个女人突然出现；她坐在床上，穿着白色的睡袍。她点亮灯，靠着一堆枕头看小说。有时，她会抽上一根烟。只能看见她裸露的肩膀和脖子。","Curtis Hartman came near dying from the effects of that night of waiting in the church, and also he found in the thing that happened what he took to be the way of life for him.On other evenings when he had waited he had not been able to see, through the little hole in the glass, any part of the school teacher’s room except that occupied by her bed.In the darkness he had waited until the woman suddenly appeared sitting in the bed in her white night-robe.When the light was turned up she propped herself up among the pillows and read a book.Sometimes she smoked one of the cigarettes.Only her bare shoulders and throat were visible."
"那个一月的夜晚，在他几乎快被冻死，好几次脑海里出现了奇怪的幻景，以至于他不得不用意志力强迫自己清醒之后，凯特·斯威夫特终于出现了。隔壁的房间亮起了灯，这位苦苦守候的牧师紧盯着那张空床。紧接着，在他眼前，一个赤裸的女人倒在了床上。她脸朝下躺在那里哭泣着，用拳头捶打着枕头。最后一轮恸哭爆发完了，她半坐起身。就在这个等着偷窥而且完全忘记了思考的男人面前，这个罪恶化身的女人开始祈祷。在灯光下，她展露的身体苗条而结实，看上去就像镶铅框的窗玻璃上基督面前的那个男孩。","On the January night, after he had come near dying with cold and after his mind had two or three times actually slipped away into an odd land of fantasy so that he had by an exercise of will power to force himself back into consciousness, Kate Swift appeared.In the room next door a lamp was lighted and the waiting man stared into an empty bed.Then upon the bed before his eyes a naked woman threw herself.Lying face downward she wept and beat with her fists upon the pillow.With a final outburst of weeping she half arose, and in the presence of the man who had waited to look and not to think thoughts the woman of sin began to pray.In the lamplight her figure, slim and strong, looked like the figure of the boy in the presence of the Christ on the leaded window."
"柯蒂斯·哈特曼永远都回忆不起自己是如何走出教堂的。他大叫一声站起来，把沉重的书桌也拽得在地板上拖了一下。《圣经》掉在地上，在寂静中发出巨大的声响。当隔壁房子的灯光熄灭后，他跌跌撞撞地走下楼梯，来到了街上。他沿着街道，边走边跑，来到《温斯堡鹰报》的门前。那时，乔治·威拉德正在办公室里走来走去，内心经历着挣扎。牧师便开始向他断断续续地讲述着。“上帝之道远非世人所能了解的啊。”他喊道，迅速跑进屋里，关上了门。他开始靠近这位年轻人，两眼发光，声音充满了热情。“我找到光明了，”他喊着，“我在这个镇上呆了十年之后，上帝通过一个女人的身体向我显灵了。”他的声音低下去，变成了低语。“我本来不明白，”他说，“我原本以为那是对灵魂的考验，结果它只是为一种崭新的、更美丽的灵做准备。上帝在凯特·斯威夫特这个赤裸着跪在床上的女教师身上向我显灵了。你认识凯特·斯威夫特吗？尽管她也许没有意识到，她是上帝的工具，承载着真理之义。”","Curtis Hartman never remembered how he got out of the church.With a cry he arose, dragging the heavy desk along the floor.The Bible fell, making a great clatter in the silence.When the light in the house next door went out he stumbled down the stairway and into the street.Along the street he went and ran in at the door of the Winesburg Eagle.To George Willard, who was tramping up and down in the office undergoing a struggle of his own, he began to talk half incoherently.“The ways of God are beyond human understanding,” he cried, running in quickly and closing the door.He began to advance upon the young man, his eyes glowing and his voice ringing with fervor.“I have found the light,” he cried.“After ten years in this town, God has manifested himself to me in the body of a woman.”His voice dropped and he began to whisper.“I did not understand,” he said.“What I took to be a trial of my soul was only a preparation for a new and more beautiful fervor of the spirit.God has appeared to me in the person of Kate Swift, the school teacher, kneeling naked on a bed.Do you know Kate Swift?Although she may not be aware of it, she is an instrument of God, bearing the message of truth.”"
"柯蒂斯·哈特曼牧师转身跑出了报社办公室。他在门口处停住，来回打量着空荡荡的街道，又转过来面对着乔治·威拉德。“我得救了。再也无所畏惧了。”他举起一只流着血的拳头给乔治看。“我砸碎了窗玻璃，”他大声说道，“现在整个窗子都要换了。上帝赐予了我力量，我便用拳头把窗子打破了。”","Reverend Curtis Hartman turned and ran out of the office.At the door he stopped, and after looking up and down the deserted street, turned again to George Willard.“I am delivered.Have no fear.”He held up a bleeding fist for the young man to see.“I smashed the glass of the window,” he cried.“Now it will have to be wholly replaced.The strength of God was in me and I broke it with my fist.”"
"第十三章 女教师","Chapter 13 The Teacher"
"温斯堡的街道上积着厚厚的雪。早上十点左右开始下雪，接着一阵风刮起来，把大街上的雪吹得如云雾般四处飞散。通往镇上的泥巴路被冻住了，变得非常光滑；有的地方，泥巴上面还覆盖着一层冰。“滑起雪橇来肯定很好。”威尔·亨德森站在埃德·格里菲思酒吧的吧台边说。他走出酒吧，遇到了药剂师西尔维斯特·韦斯特，后者穿着一种笨重的保暖防水套鞋，踉跄地沿街走着。“大雪会让人们星期六到镇上来的。”药剂师说道。两人停下脚步，交谈起来。威尔·亨德森只穿着一件薄外套，没穿套鞋，冷得用右脚脚趾磕着左脚后跟。“下雪对小麦生长有好处。”药剂师一副洞察先机的样子。","Snow lay deep in the streets of Winesburg.It had begun to snow about ten o’clock in the morning and a wind sprang up and blew the snow in clouds along Main Street.The frozen mud roads that led into town were fairly smooth and in places ice covered the mud.“There will be good sleighing,” said Will Henderson, standing by the bar in Ed Griffith’s saloon.Out of the saloon he went and met Sylvester West the druggist stumbling along in the kind of heavy overshoes called arctics.“Snow will bring the people into town on Saturday,” said the druggist.The two men stopped and discussed their affairs.Will Henderson, who had on a light overcoat and no overshoes, kicked the heel of his left foot with the toe of the right.“Snow will be good for the wheat,” observed the druggist sagely."
"无事可干的乔治·威拉德很高兴，因为他那天刚好不想开工。周报已经印好，周三晚上就送往了邮局，雪正好从周四开始下。八点的时候，早班火车已经开走，他把一双溜冰鞋放进口袋，朝水库池塘走去，但却没有在那里溜冰。他经过池塘，沿着瓦英河旁的一条小路一直走到一片毛榉树林里。他在一根圆木旁生起了火，然后坐在木头尾上开始思索。开始下雪的时候，风也刮了起来，他急忙给火堆添柴。","Young George Willard, who had nothing to do, was glad because he did not feel like working that day.The weekly paper had been printed and taken to the post office Wednesday evening and the snow began to fall on Thursday.At eight o’clock, after the morning train had passed, he put a pair of skates in his pocket and went up to Waterworks Pond but did not go skating.Past the pond and along a path that followed Wine Creek he went until he came to a grove of beech trees.There he built a fire against the side of a log and sat down at the end of the log to think.When the snow began to fall and the wind to blow he hurried about getting fuel for the fire."
"这位年轻的记者在想凯特·斯威夫特，她过去曾是他的教师。前晚，他去她家拿了一本她想让他看的书，同她单独呆了一个小时。这已经是第四还是第五次了，那位女教师极热情地同他攀谈，可他弄不懂她这么做是什么意思。他开始确信她必然爱上了自己，这个想法让他感到既开心又烦恼。","The young reporter was thinking of Kate Swift, who had once been his school teacher.On the evening before he had gone to her house to get a book she wanted him to read and had been alone with her for an hour.For the fourth or fifth time the woman had talked to him with great earnestness and he could not make out what she meant by her talk.He began to believe she must be in love with him and the thought was both pleasing and annoying."
"他从木头上一跃而起，开始往火堆上添柴。他环视四周，确定周围没有人，然后开始高声地自言自语，假装那位女士就在他面前。“噢，你只不过是装模作样，你自己知道。”他宣布，“我要把这件事弄明白。你等着瞧吧。”","Up from the log he sprang and began to pile sticks on the fire.Looking about to be sure he was alone he talked aloud pretending he was in the presence of the woman, “Oh, you’re just letting on, you know you are,” he declared.“I am going to find out about you.You wait and see.”"
"年轻人站起身，沿着回镇上的小路走了，丢下火堆在树林里熊熊燃烧。他穿过街道的时候，那双溜冰鞋在他口袋里铿锵作响。在新威拉德旅社他自己的房间里，他在壁炉里生起火，然后靠在床头。他开始绮念丛生，于是他拉上百叶窗，闭上眼睛，面朝着墙躺着。他拿过一个枕头搂在怀里，先是想到了那位女教师，她用语言点燃了他内心的激情。接着，他又想到了海伦·怀特，那位本镇银行家的苗条的女儿；他已经暗恋她很长时间了。","The young man got up and went back along the path toward town leaving the fire blazing in the wood.As he went through the streets the skates clanked in his pocket.In his own room in the New Willard House he built a fire in the stove and lay down on top of the bed.He began to have lustful thoughts and pulling down the shade of the window closed his eyes and turned his face to the wall.He took a pillow into his arms and embraced it thinking first of the school teacher, who by her words had stirred something within him, and later of Helen White, the slim daughter of the town banker, with whom he had been for a long time half in love."
"那天夜里九点钟时，街上的雪已经积得很厚了，天气变得极冷。走路变得很困难。商店里漆黑一片，人们都慢吞吞地回自己家去了。从克利夫兰来的夜班火车晚点了很长时间，但却没人在意。到十点的时候，小镇里的一千八百位居民都已入眠，只有四人例外。","By nine o’clock of that evening snow lay deep in the streets and the weather had become bitter cold.It was difficult to walk about.The stores were dark and the people had crawled away to their houses.The evening train from Cleveland was very late but nobody was interested in its arrival.By ten o’clock all but four of the eighteen hundred citizens of the town were in bed."
"守夜人霍普·希金斯半睡半醒。他是个瘸子，拄着一根沉重的拐杖。深夜里他拿着一盏灯。在九点到十点间巡夜。他蹒跚地踏着积雪走过整条大街，检查每家商店的门是否关好。接着他转进小巷，检查每家的后门。确定所有的门都锁好后，他便急忙转过街角，到新威拉德旅社去敲门。夜晚接下来的时间，他就打算呆在炉火边了。“你去睡吧。我来看炉子。”他对睡在旅社办公室里一张简易床上的服务生说道。","Hop Higgins, the night watchman, was partially awake.He was lame and carried a heavy stick.On dark nights he carried a lantern.Between nine and ten o’clock he went his rounds.Up and down Main Street he stumbled through the drifts trying the doors of the stores.Then he went into alleyways and tried the back doors.Finding all tight he hurried around the corner to the New Willard House and beat on the door.Through the rest of the night he intended to stay by the stove.“You go to bed.I’ll keep the stove going,” he said to the boy who slept on a cot in the hotel office."
"霍普·希金斯在炉边坐下，脱下鞋子。那名服务生去睡觉后，他开始思考自己的事情。他打算在春天的时候粉刷房子，于是坐在炉边计算油漆和人工的花费。那使他想起了其他的账。这位守夜人六十岁了，他想退休。内战时他当过兵，现在领着一笔微薄的补助。他希望能找到一个新的谋生之法，想要成为一名专业的雪貂养殖员。他已经在自己家的地窖里养了四头这种模样古怪的、凶狠的小动物，那是打猎爱好者用来追赶兔子用的。“现在，我有一只雌的，三只雄的。”他若有所思地说，“如果幸运的话，到春天我就能有十二或十五只了。再过一年，我就能在打猎报纸上登广告出售雪貂了。”","Hop Higgins sat down by the stove and took off his shoes.When the boy had gone to sleep he began to think of his own affairs.He intended to paint his house in the spring and sat by the stove calculating the cost of paint and labor.That led him into other calculations.The night watchman was sixty years old and wanted to retire.He had been a soldier in the Civil War and drew a small pension.He hoped to find some new method of making a living and aspired to become a professional breeder of ferrets.Already he had four of the strangely shaped savage little creatures, that are used by sportsmen in the pursuit of rabbits, in the cellar of his house.“Now I have one male and three females,” he mused.“If I am lucky by spring I shall have twelve or fifteen.In another year I shall be able to begin advertising ferrets for sale in the sporting papers.”"
"守夜人坐在椅子里，脑袋里一片空白。他没睡着。多年的习惯使他练就了长夜里静坐几个钟头不眠也不醒的本事。到了早上，他又精神焕发，犹如睡过一觉一样。","The nightwatchman settled into his chair and his mind became a blank.He did not sleep.By years of practice he had trained himself to sit for hours through the long nights neither asleep nor awake.In the morning he was almost as refreshed as though he had slept."
"除了安稳地坐在火炉后面的椅子里的霍普·希金斯，温斯堡里只有三个人还醒着。乔治·威拉德在《鹰报》办公室里假装忙着写报道。实际上，他还在继续早晨在树林火堆边上的胡思乱想。在基督教长老会的钟楼里，柯蒂斯·哈特曼牧师正坐在黑暗中，准备接受上帝的启示；而凯特·斯威夫特，那位学校女教师，正离开家要去风雪中散步。","With Hop Higgins safely stowed away in the chair behind the stove only three people were awake in Winesburg.George Willard was in the office of the Eagle pretending to be at work on the writing of a story but in reality continuing the mood of the morning by the fire in the wood.In the bell tower of the Presbyterian Church the Reverend Curtis Hartman was sitting in the darkness preparing himself for a revelation from God, and Kate Swift, the school teacher, was leaving her house for a walk in the storm."
"凯特·斯威夫特出门的时候已经十点多了，她原本没打算去散步。就仿佛是因为那一老一少正想着她才驱使她走进寒冬的街道上。伊丽莎白·斯威夫特阿姨去镇政府了。她去办她投资项目的抵押贷款事宜，直到第二天才会回来。她的女儿坐在起居室里一个叫自动加料火炉的大火炉旁边看书。突然，她跳起来，从前门衣架上抓过一件斗篷，跑出了房子。","It was past ten o’clock when Kate Swift set out and the walk was unpremeditated.It was as though the man and the boy, by thinking of her, had driven her forth into the wintry streets.Aunt Elizabeth Swift had gone to the county seat concerning some business in connection with mortgages in which she had money invested and would not be back until the next day.By a huge stove, called a base burner, in the living room of the house sat the daughter reading a book.Suddenly she sprang to her feet and, snatching a cloak from a rack by the front door, ran out of the house."
"三十岁的凯特·斯威夫特并不是温斯堡闻名的美女。她肤色不太好，脸上还有雀斑，显示出身体的不健康。她独自一人走在冬天黑夜的街头时却是可爱的。她的背很直，肩膀宽阔结实，她的容貌很像夏日傍晚昏暗光线中花园里的女神小雕像的模样。下午，这位女教师去找韦林医生检查过身体。医生责备了她，并告诉她有失聪的危险。凯特·斯威夫特呆在风雪中是不明智的，不明智的甚至是危险的。","At the age of thirty Kate Swift was not known in Winesburg as a pretty woman.Her complexion was not good and her face was covered with blotches that indicated ill health.Alone in the night in the winter streets she was lovely.Her back was straight, her shoulders square, and her features were as the features of a tiny goddess on a pedestal in a garden in the dim light of a summer evening.During the afternoon the school teacher had been to see Doctor Welling concerning her health.The doctor had scolded her and had declared she was in danger of losing her hearing.It was foolish for Kate Swift to be abroad in the storm, foolish and perhaps dangerous."
"这个女人已经不记得医生的警告了，即便她记得，她也不会回去。她觉得很冷，可走了五分钟后就不再想冷不冷了。起初，她走到了她所在街道的尽头，接着穿过两个放置在饲料仓前面地上的干草堆，然后进入了特鲁连山。沿着特鲁连山她来到内德·温特斯谷仓，接着转向东边，顺着一条两边都是低矮房屋的街道穿过福音山，走上萨克路。这条路沿着浅浅的山谷，经过艾克·斯米德养鸡场一直延伸到水库池塘。她一路走着，那种驱使她走出家门的鲁莽而兴奋的情绪去而复返。","The woman in the streets did not remember the words of the doctor and would not have turned back had she remembered.She was very cold but after walking for five minutes no longer minded the cold.First she went to the end of her own street and then across a pair of hay scales set in the ground before a feed barn and into Trunion Pike.Along Trunion Pike she went to Ned Winters’ barn and turning east followed a street of low frame houses that led over Gospel Hill and into Sucker Road that ran down a shallow valley past Ike Smead’s chicken farm to Waterworks Pond.As she went along, the bold, excited mood that had driven her out of doors passed and then returned again."
"凯特·斯威夫特的性格中有些尖锐且令人难以亲近的品质。人们都感觉到了。在学校教室里，她沉默、冷淡、严厉，可她却以一种奇特的方式和学生们十分亲近。很长一段时间，她才偶尔一次会心血来潮，变得快乐。全教室的孩子们都能感到她的欢乐。有好一会儿他们都不学习，只是坐在椅子上看着她。","There was something biting and forbidding in the character of Kate Swift.Everyone felt it.In the schoolroom she was silent, cold, and stern, and yet in an odd way very close to her pupils.Once in a long while something seemed to have come over her and she was happy.All of the children in the schoolroom felt the effect of her happiness.For a time they did not work but sat back in their chairs and looked at her."
"这位教师双手在背后紧握着，在教室里走来走去，飞快地说着话。她想到了什么似乎无关紧要。一次，她对孩子们说起了查尔斯·兰姆，还编了些奇怪又亲切的小故事来谈到这位已经过世的作家。故事是在这样一种氛围下被讲述的：某人曾住在查尔斯·兰姆的家中，还了解他的一些个人隐私。孩子们都有些弄糊涂了，觉得查尔斯·兰姆一定曾在温斯堡住过。","With hands clasped behind her back the school teacher walked up and down in the schoolroom and talked very rapidly.It did not seem to matter what subject came into her mind.Once she talked to the children of Charles Lamb and made up strange, intimate little stories concerning the life of the dead writer.The stories were told with the air of one who had lived in a house with Charles Lamb and knew all the secrets of his private life.The children were somewhat confused, thinking Charles Lamb must be someone who had once lived in Winesburg."
"还有一次，这位女教师对孩子们谈到了本韦努托·切利尼。那次他们都哈哈大笑。她将那位老艺术家塑造成了一个多么狂妄、暴躁、勇敢而又可爱的人啊！她也编了些关于他的奇闻轶事。故事中出现了一位同在米兰市、就住在切利尼楼上的德国音乐教师，使得孩子们大笑不止。一个叫休格斯·麦肯纳茨的胖胖的、脸颊红红的男孩子笑得太厉害了，竟晕头转向地从椅子上掉了下去，弄得凯特也和他一起大笑了起来。接下来，她突然又变得冷淡而严厉起来。","On another occasion the teacher talked to the children of Benvenuto Cellini.That time they laughed.What a bragging, blustering, brave, lovable fellow she made of the old artist!Concerning him also she invented anecdotes.There was one of a German music teacher who had a room above Cellini’s lodgings in the city of Milan that made the boys guffaw.Sugars McNutts, a fat boy with red cheeks, laughed so hard that he became dizzy and fell off his seat and Kate Swift laughed with him.Then suddenly she became again cold and stern."
"在冬夜里，当她在冰雪覆盖的无人街头散步时，这位女教师的生活中出现了一次危机。尽管温斯堡没人会疑心，但她的生活曾经险象环生。当她日复一日地在教室里工作，或是在街头漫步时，悲伤、希望和欲望就在她内心激战。冷漠的外表下，她的内心却发生着不同寻常的大事件。镇上的居民认为她是个不折不扣的老处女，因为她言辞犀利、特立独行，他们便觉得她少了那种使生活有血有肉的普通人的情感。事实上，她是所有人中灵魂最渴望激情的。自从她旅游回来定居在温斯堡，并随后成为一名学校教师的这五年里，她不止一次地被内心激烈的交战驱使着走出家门，在外散步到深更半夜。有一个雨夜，她在外面呆了六个钟头，回家后和伊丽莎白·斯威夫特阿姨吵了一架。“我真高兴你不是个男人，”这位母亲尖刻地说，“我曾经不止一次地等待你爸爸回家，不知道他又惹了什么新麻烦。我有理由感到不安，如果我是不想看到你父亲最糟糕的那面在你身上重现，你不可以埋怨我。”","On the winter night when she walked through the deserted snow-covered streets, a crisis had come into the life of the school teacher.Although no one in Winesburg would have suspected it, her life had been very adventurous.It was still adventurous.Day by day as she worked in the schoolroom or walked in the streets, grief, hope, and desire fought within her.Behind a cold exterior the most extraordinary events transpired in her mind.The people of the town thought of her as a confirmed old maid and because she spoke sharply and went her own way thought her lacking in all the human feeling that did so much to make and mar their own lives.In reality she was the most eagerly passionate soul among them, and more than once, in the five years since she had come back from her travels to settle in Winesburg and become a school teacher, had been compelled to go out of the house and walk half through the night fighting out some battle raging within.Once on a night when it rained she had stayed out six hours and when she came home had a quarrel with Aunt Elizabeth Swift.“I am glad you’re not a man,” said the mother sharply.“More than once I’ve waited for your father to come home, not knowing what new mess he had got into.I’ve had my share of uncertainty and you cannot blame me if I do not want to see the worst side of him reproduced in you.”"
"凯特·斯威夫特一想到乔治·威拉德，心里就炽热起来。在他学生时代写的东西里面，她认为她发现了天才的火花，她想要让这火花燃成熊熊大火。夏日的某一天，她来到《鹰报》办公室，发现这个年轻人没事可干，于是她便带着他走出大街，来到集市广场。两个人坐在草坪上谈话。女教师试图使这个年轻人意识到，作为一名作家他将会遇到的一些困难。“你必须弄懂生活。”她断言，声音因恳切而颤抖。她握住乔治的肩膀，将他转了过来，以便她能正视他。路过的人有可能以为他们是要拥抱。“你要想当作家，就必须停止玩弄文字。”她解释道，“在你准备得更充分之前，最好能放弃动笔的念头。现在是去体验生活的时候。我不想吓唬你，可我得让你明白你想尝试的事情的重要性。你不能仅仅做一个文字贩子。你该去学习的是人们在想些什么，而不是他们在说些什么。”","Kate Swift’s mind was ablaze with thoughts of George Willard.In something he had written as a school boy she thought she had recognized the spark of genius and wanted to blow on the spark.One day in the summer she had gone to the Eagle office and finding the boy unoccupied had taken him out Main Street to the Fair Ground, where the two sat on a grassy bank and talked.The school teacher tried to bring home to the mind of the boy some conception of the difficulties he would have to face as a writer.“You will have to know life,” she declared, and her voice trembled with earnestness.She took hold of George Willard’s shoulders and turned him about so that she could look into his eyes.A passer-by might have thought them about to embrace.“If you are to become a writer you’ll have to stop fooling with words,” she explained.“It would be better to give up the notion of writing until you are better prepared.Now it’s time to be living.I don’t want to frighten you, but I would like to make you understand the import of what you think of attempting.You must not become a mere peddler of words.The thing to learn is to know what people are thinking about, not what they say.”"
"在那个周四暴风雪之夜的前一晚，当柯蒂斯·哈特曼牧师在教堂钟楼坐等一窥女教师裸体的时候，年轻的维拉德曾前去拜访女教师并向她借一本书。接下来便发生了那件使年轻人困惑不解的事情。他将书夹在胳膊下，准备离开。凯特·斯威夫特又一次以极大的热忱对他说话。夜色降临，房间里的光线变得昏暗。在他转身要走的时候，她轻声地叫他的名字，并在冲动之下抓住了他的手。因为这位记者正迅速地成长为一个男人，他的几分男性吸引力，与男孩的迷人特质相结合，使这位孤独女人的内心躁动了起来。一股想使他明白生活的意义、让他学会真实而诚实地解读生活的狂热欲望传遍了她的全身。她往前靠过去，嘴唇擦过他的脸颊。与此同时，他第一次发现了她五官的显著之美。他们都感到有些尴尬。为了摆脱这种感觉，她变得严厉而专横。“有什么用呢？得再过十年，你才会开始明白我跟你说的话是什么意思。”她激动地叫道。","On the evening before that stormy Thursday night when the Reverend Curtis Hartman sat in the bell tower of the church waiting to look at her body, young Willard had gone to visit the teacher and to borrow a book.It was then the thing happened that confused and puzzled the boy.He had the book under his arm and was preparing to depart.Again Kate Swift talked with great earnestness.Night was coming on and the light in the room grew dim.As he turned to go she spoke his name softly and with an impulsive movement took hold of his hand.Because the reporter was rapidly becoming a man, something of his man’s appeal, combined with the winsomeness of the boy, stirred the heart of the lonely woman.A passionate desire to have him understand the import of life, to learn to interpret it truly and honestly, swept over her.Leaning forward, her lips brushed his cheek.At the same moment he for the first time became aware of the marked beauty of her features.They were both embarrassed, and to relieve her feeling she became harsh and domineering.“What’s the use?It will be ten years before you begin to understand what I mean what I talk to you,” she cried passionately."
"那个暴风雪的夜晚，就在牧师在教堂里苦苦等候她的同时，凯特·斯威夫特来到了《温斯堡鹰报》的办公室，打算同年轻人再谈一次。在雪地里走得久了，她感到寒冷、孤独和疲惫。当她走过大街的时候，看到印刷室窗户里透出的灯光照在雪地上。于是，冲动之下，她打开门走了进去。她在办公室里的炉火边坐了一个小时，谈着生活。她满怀激情与热忱地说着。那种驱使她走入雪中的冲动全都被注入了这次谈话之中。她变得充满灵感，就像她有时在学校的孩子们面前那样。一种想要向这个年轻人开启人生大门的强烈渴望占据着她的内心。这个人曾是她学生，而且在她看来，他也许具备某种洞察生活的天赋。这种热切太强烈了，以至于变成了生理上的冲动。她的双手又扶住了他的肩膀，将他转过身来。在昏暗的灯光中，她的眼睛闪闪发亮。她起身大笑起来，并不是她平时的那种尖刻的笑，而是一种奇特的、犹豫不决的笑。“我必须得走了。”她说，“马上就走，如果我留下，我会想要吻你的。”","On the night of the storm and while the minister sat in the church waiting for her, Kate Swift went to the office of the Winesburg Eagle, intending to have another talk with the boy.After the long walk in the snow she was cold, lonely, and tired.As she came through Main Street she saw the light from the printshop window shining on the snow and on an impulse opened the door and went in.For an hour she sat by the stove in the office talking of life.She talked with passionate earnestness.The impulse that had driven her out into the snow poured itself out into talk.She became inspired as she sometimes did in the presence of the children in school.A great eagerness to open the door of life to the boy, who had been her pupil and who she thought might possess a talent for the understanding of life, had possession of her.So strong was her passion that it became something physical.Again her hands took hold of his shoulders and she turned him about.In the dim light her eyes blazed.She arose and laughed, not sharply as was customary with her, but in a queer, hesitating way.“I must be going,” she said.“In a moment, if I stay, I’ll be wanting to kiss you.”"
"报社办公室里一阵手忙脚乱。凯特·斯威夫特转身走向门口。她虽然是教师，可她也是一个女人。当她看着乔治·威拉德的时候，那种想要被男人去爱的强烈欲望——曾千百次像暴风雪般袭遍全身的欲望——占据了她的身心。在灯光中，乔治·威拉德看上去不再是个男孩，而是一个可以扮演男性角色的男子汉。","In the newspaper office a confusion arose.Kate Swift turned and walked to the door.She was a teacher but she was also a woman.As she looked at George Willard, the passionate desire to be loved by a man, that had a thousand times before swept like a storm over her body, took possession of her.In the lamplight George Willard looked no longer a boy, but a man ready to play the part of a man."
"女教师让乔治·威拉德抱住自己。在这间小小的、温暖的办公室里，空气突然变得沉重，她也失去了全身的力气。她靠在门边一个低矮的柜台上，等待着。他走过来，把一只手放在她的肩膀上；她转过身，让自己重重地倒在他身上。乔治·威拉德随即变得愈加困惑了。有一会儿，他将这个女人的身体紧紧抱在胸前，但那身体随即就变得僵硬了。两个小拳头突然开始打在他的脸上。等那位女教师落荒而逃，只留他独自一人时，他便在办公室里来回踱着步，愤怒地大骂。","The school teacher let George Willard take her into his arms.In the warm little office the air became suddenly heavy and the strength went out of her body.Leaning against a low counter by the door she waited.When he came and put a hand on her shoulder she turned and let her body fall heavily against him.For George Willard the confusion was immediately increased.For a moment he held the body of the woman tightly against his body and then it stiffened.Two sharp little fists began to beat on his face.When the school teacher had run away and left him alone, he walked up and down the office swearing furiously."
"直到柯蒂斯·哈特曼牧师突然闯进来的时候，他还在困惑之中。牧师闯进来的时候，乔治·威拉德觉得全镇的人都疯了。牧师挥动着一只流血的拳头，宣布那位前一刻还被乔治抱在怀里的女人是上帝启示真理的工具。","It was into this confusion that the Reverend Curtis Hartman protruded himself.When he came in George Willard thought the town had gone mad.Shaking a bleeding fist in the air, the minister proclaimed the woman George had only a moment before held in his arms an instrument of God bearing a message of truth."
"乔治吹熄了窗边的灯，锁上印刷室的门，回家了。他经过旅社的办公室，走过还沉迷于饲养雪貂美梦中的霍普·希金斯，然后他上楼进了自己的房间。炉子里的火已经熄灭，他在寒冷中脱掉衣服。他上床的时候，觉得被单就像干雪做成的毛毯一样。","George blew out the lamp by the window and locking the door of the printshop went home.Through the hotel office, past Hop Higgins lost in his dream of the raising of ferrets, he went and up into his own room.The fire in the stove had gone out and he undressed in the cold.When he got into bed the sheets were like blankets of dry snow."
"乔治·威拉德在床上辗转反侧。今天下午他还躺在床上，抱着枕头，思索着凯特·斯威夫特的想法。他觉得突然变疯了的牧师的话又在耳边响起，。他双眼盯着房子。忿恨是遭受挫折的男性的一种常情。那股愤懑过去后，他试图弄明白究竟发生了什么。他仍搞不清楚。于是他在心里翻来覆去地想着。几个小时过去了，他开始意识到一定是新的一天到了。四点钟的时候，他把被子拉到脖子下，准备睡觉。就在他昏昏欲睡，合上眼睛的时候，他伸出一只手在黑暗里摸索。“我错过了什么事。我错过了凯特·斯威夫特一直想要告诉我的事情。”他睡意沉沉地咕哝着。接着他就睡着了。他于是成了温斯堡在这个冬夜里最后一个入眠的人。","George Willard rolled about in the bed on which had lain in the afternoon hugging the pillow and thinking thoughts of Kate Swift.The words of the minister, who he thought had gone suddenly insane, rang in his ears.His eyes stared about the room.The resentment, natural to the baffled male, passed and he tried to understand what had happened.He could not make it out.Over and over he turned the matter in his mind.Hours passed and he began to think it must be time for another day to come.At four o’clock he pulled the covers up about his neck and tried to sleep.When he became drowsy and closed his eyes, he raised a hand and with it groped about in the darkness.“I have missed something.I have missed something Kate Swift was trying to tell me,” he muttered sleepily.Then he slept and in all Winesburg he was the last soul on that winter night to go to sleep."
"第十四章 孤独","Chapter 14 Loneliness"
"他是阿尔·鲁滨孙太太的儿子。阿尔·鲁滨孙太太在温斯堡东面两英里的小镇边界外曾有过一个农场，位于从特鲁连山峰蜿蜒而下的一条小路上。农场的农舍漆成了棕色，所有朝着马路的窗户的百叶窗都紧闭着。房前的马路上，一群小鸡和两只雌珠鸡窝在厚厚的尘土里。那段日子，伊诺克就同母亲住在这房子里。那时他还是个少年，在温斯堡高中读书。老一辈的人记得他是个安静却面带笑容的少年，不怎么爱说话。他走到镇上的时候会走在大马路中间，有时还看着一本书。赶着联畜马车的车夫不得不朝他大吼大骂，好让他知道自己是走在哪儿了，他才会从中间道上离开，让别人过去。","He was the son of Mrs. Al Robinson who once owned a farm on a side road leading off Trunion Pike, east of Winesburg and two miles beyond the town limits.The farmhouse was painted brown and the blinds to all of the windows facing the road were kept closed.In the road before the house a flock of chickens, accompanied by two guinea hens, lay in the deep dust.Enoch lived in the house with his mother in those days and when he was a young boy went to school at the Winesburg High School.Old citizens remembered him as a quiet, smiling youth inclined to silence.He walked in the middle of the road when he came into town and sometimes read a book.Drivers of teams had to shout and swear to make him realize where he was so that he would turn out of the beaten track and let them pass."
"伊诺克二十一岁时去了纽约，在那儿做了十五年的城里人。他学习法语，还进了一家艺术学校，希望能开发自己的绘画才能。他暗自打算去巴黎，在大师手下完成自己的艺术学习，但却从未成行。","When he was twenty-one years old Enoch went to New York City and was a city man for fifteen years.He studied French and went to an art school, hoping to develop a faculty he had for drawing.In his own mind he planned to go to Paris and to finish his art education among the masters there, but that never turned out."
"伊诺克·鲁滨孙始终一事无成。他能画得很好，脑子里也有许多奇巧的想法原可以用一个画家的笔描绘出来。可是，他总是孩子气，这成了他取得世俗成就的障碍。他从未长大，所以他无法理解别人，也无法使别人理解自己。他内心的孩子气使他一直与一些东西发生碰撞，比如金钱、性爱或者舆论之类的现实的东西。有一次，他被一辆电车撞倒，摔到了一根铁柱子上。那次事故使他瘸了腿。这也是诸多阻碍伊诺克·鲁滨孙成功的原因之一。","Nothing ever turned out for Enoch Robinson.He could draw well enough and he had many odd delicate thoughts hidden away in his brain that might have expressed themselves through the brush of a painter, but he was always a child and that was a handicap to his worldly development.He never grew up and of course he couldn’t understand people and he couldn’t make people understand him.The child in him kept bumping against things, against actualities like money and sex and opinions.Once he was hit by a street car and thrown against an iron post.That made him lame.It was one of the many things that kept things from turning out for Enoch Robinson"
"伊诺克初到纽约，还没被生活的现实弄得迷惑慌乱的时候，他经常和一群年轻人来往。他加入了一个年轻艺术家团体，里面有男有女。他们有时会在夜晚来他家里拜访。一次他喝醉了，被带到了警察局，一位警官把他狠狠地吓唬了一通。还有一次，他在自己住所前的人行道上遇到一个妓女，他想跟她发生关系。那名女子跟伊诺克一同走过了三个街区，接着这个年轻人就害怕起来，于是落荒而逃。那名女子一直在喝酒；这个小插曲倒让她乐不可支。她靠在一栋建筑的墙上放声大笑，她笑得那么开心，还引得另一名男子停下来和她一起大笑。后来那两个人一起大笑着走了，伊诺克却偷偷溜回自己的房间，浑身颤抖，懊恼不已。","In New York City, when he first went there to live and before he became confused and disconcerted by the facts of life, Enoch went about a good deal with young men.He got into a group of other young artists, both men and women, and in the evenings they sometimes came to visit him in his room.Once he got drunk and was taken to a police station where a police magistrate frightened him horribly, and once he tried to have an affair with a woman of the town met on the sidewalk before his lodging house.The woman and Enoch walked together three blocks and then the young man grew afraid and ran away.The woman had been drinking and the incident amused her.She leaned against the wall of a building and laughed so heartily that another man stopped and laughed with her.The two went away together, still laughing, and Enoch crept off to his room trembling and vexed."
"年轻的鲁滨孙在纽约的住所正对着华盛顿广场，房间又长又窄，像个过道。牢记这点很重要。伊诺克的故事实际上就是一个房间的故事，而不仅仅是一个人的故事。","The room in which young Robinson lived in New York faced Washington Square and was long and narrow like a hallway.It is important to get that fixed in your mind.The story of Enoch is in fact the story of a room almost more than it is the story of a man."
"于是，晚上的时候，年轻的伊诺克的朋友们便到他的房间来了。他们并没什么特别的过人之处，不过是些夸夸其谈的艺术家。人们都知道这类空谈的艺术家。古往今来，他们都是聚在房间里高谈阔论。他们谈论艺术，激情澎湃，几乎称得上是狂热且认真无比。他们认为这比艺术本身重要得多。","And so into the room in the evening came young Enoch’s friends.There was nothing particularly striking about them except that they were artists of the kind that talk.Everyone knows of the talking artists.Throughout all of the known history of the world they have gathered in rooms and talked.They talk of art and are passionately, almost feverishly, in earnest about it.They think it matters much more than it does."
"就这样，这些人聚在一起，边抽烟边谈论。伊诺克·鲁滨孙，这个从温斯堡镇边上的农场里来的小伙子，也在那里。他呆在角落里，大多数时候一言不发。他那双孩子般的蓝色大眼睛是多么出神地望着！墙上挂着他作的画，都是粗糙的半成品。他的朋友们谈到了那些画。他们靠在扶手椅里，摇头晃脑地说个不停。关于线条、价值和构思的诸多言论再三被提起。","And so these people gathered and smoked cigarettes and talked and Enoch Robinson, the boy from the farm near Winesburg, was there.He stayed in a corner and for the most part said nothing.How his big blue childlike eyes stared about!On the walls were pictures he had made, crude things, half finished.His friends talked of these.Leaning back in their chairs, they talked and talked with their heads rocking from side to side.Words were said about line and values and composition, lots of words, such as are always being said."
"伊诺克也想谈点什么，可他不知道怎么说。他太激动了，所以语不成句。他竭力开口的时候就会语无伦次、期期艾艾，声音听起来奇怪而刺耳。这使得他干脆闭上了嘴。他知道自己想说什么，可他也知道他是永不可能说出来的。当别人评价他的某幅画时，他想这样突然说：“你们没明白。”他还想解释：“你们面前的这幅画并不是你们看到和谈论的那样。那里面有些别的东西，有些你们根本没看出来、也根本没打算看出来的东西。看看这边的这张，就在门边上，有窗外的灯照在上面。路边的黑点你们根本就没注意到，你看，那才是所有东西的开端。那里有一丛接骨木树，就是经常长在俄亥俄州温斯堡我家门前路边的那种树，树里面藏着某种东西。那是个女人，是个女人藏在里面。她从马背上摔下来，可马已经跑得看不见了。难道你们没看到驾车的老人在焦急地张望吗？那是萨德·格雷拜克，他在路那头有个农场。他在把玉米运往温斯堡，再到科姆斯托克磨坊去磨成粉。他知道接骨木树丛里有东西，有东西藏在那儿，可他不太知道那是什么。","Enoch wanted to talk too but he didn’t know how.He was too excited to talk coherently.When he tried he sputtered and stammered and his voice sounded strange and squeaky to him.That made him stop talking.He knew what he wanted to say, but he knew also that he could never by any possibility say it.When a picture he had painted was under discussion, he wanted to burst out with something like this: “You don’t get the point,” he wanted to explain; “the picture you see doesn’t consist of the things you see and say words about.There is something else, something you don’t see at all, something you aren’t intended to see.Look at this one over here, by the door here, where the light from the window falls on it.The dark spot by the road that you might not notice at all is, you see, the beginning of everything.There is a clump of elders there such as used to grow beside the road before our house back in Winesburg, Ohio, and in among the elders there is something hidden.It is a woman, that’s what it is.She has been thrown from a horse and the horse has run away out of sight.Do you not see how the old man who drives a cart looks anxiously about?That is Thad Grayback who has a farm up the road.He is taking corn to Winesburg to be ground into meal at Comstock’s mill.He knows there is something in the elders, something hidden away, and yet he doesn’t quite know."
"“是个女人，你看，就是个女人！是个女人，喔，她真可爱！她受了伤，疼痛万分，可她一声不吭。你难道没看出是怎么了吗？她十分平静地躺着，洁白而平静，美从她身体中流淌出来，蔓延至万物。美融在那背后的天空和周围的一切中。当然了，我没打算画那个女人。她太美了，画笔无法描绘。谈论构图这类东西太乏味了！你们为什么不看看天空然后走掉呢，就像我还是孩子时在俄亥俄州的温斯堡镇常做的那样？”","“It’s a woman you see, that’s what it is!It’s a woman and, oh, she is lovely!She is hurt and is suffering but she makes no sound.Don’t you see how it is?She lies quite still, white and still, and the beauty comes out from her and spreads over everything.It is in the sky back there and all around everywhere.I didn’t try to paint the woman, of course.She is too beautiful to be painted.How dull to talk of composition and such things!Why do you not look at the sky and then run away as I used to do when I was a boy back there in Winesburg, Ohio?”"
"那就是年轻的伊诺克·鲁滨孙颤抖着想对这些来他房间的客人们说的话，那时他还是纽约市的一个年轻小伙子，可他总是最后什么也没说。接着，他开始怀疑自己的想法。他害怕他的感受没有在他的作品中表达出来。在几乎羞恼的情绪中，他不再邀请朋友们到他的房间里来，继而现在养成了闭门谢客的习惯。他开始觉得，来找他的人已经太多了，他不再需要什么人了。他开始以敏锐的想象力塑造出一群自己人，他可以真正同他们谈话，给他们解释他无法对现实中的人解释的事情。他的房间里开始常驻着这样一群男男女女的灵魂，他出入其中，轮到自己说话就发言。仿佛每个伊诺克·鲁滨孙见过的人都留给了他一些自己的精髓所在，一些他能将其塑造或改变以满足他自己幻想的东西，一些能完全理解诸如他作品里接骨木树后面那名受伤的女子之类的东西。","That is the kind of thing young Enoch Robinson trembled to say to the guests who came into his room when he was a young fellow in New York City, but he always ended by saying nothing.Then he began to doubt his own mind.He was afraid the things he felt were not getting expressed in the pictures he painted.In a half indignant mood he stopped inviting people into his room and presently got into the habit of locking the door.He began to think that enough people had visited him, that he did not need people any more.With quick imagination he began to invent his own people to whom he could really talk and to whom he explained the things he had been unable to explain to living people.His room began to be inhabited by the spirits of men and women among whom he went, in his turn saying words.It was as though everyone Enoch Robinson had ever seen had left with him some essence of himself, something he could mould and change to suit his own fancy, something that understood all about such things as the wounded woman behind the elders in the pictures."
"这个温和的蓝眼睛俄亥俄年轻小伙子成了一个彻底的自我主义者，就像所有的孩子都是自我主义者一样。他不想要朋友的原因很简单：孩子们都不想要朋友。他最需要的是迎合他心意的人，他可以真正与之交谈的人，他可以随时对其夸夸其谈并任意责骂的人。你知道的，那是他幻想中的奴仆。同他们在一起时，他总是自信又大胆。他们当然也会交谈，甚至会有自己的意见，但他总是最后一个发言，而且说得最好。他就像个作家，忙于在头脑里塑造各种角色。在纽约市的这个面对华盛顿广场的每月租金六美元的房间里，他就像个蓝眼睛的小国王。","The mild, blue-eyed young Ohio boy was a complete egotist, as all children are egotists.He did not want friends for the quite simple reason that no child wants friends.He wanted most of all the people of his own mind, people with whom he could really talk, people he could harangue and scold by the hour, servants, you see, to his fancy.Among these people he was always self-confident and bold.They might talk, to be sure, and even have opinions of their own, but always he talked last and best.He was like a writer busy among the figures of his brain, a kind of tiny blue-eyed king he was, in a six-dollar room facing Washington Square in the city of New York."
"伊诺克·鲁滨孙结婚了。他开始感到孤独，希望用手触摸有血有肉的、实实在在的人。时光流逝，他的房间看上去一片空寂。性欲造访他的身体，欲望也开始在他的心中滋生。晚上，身体里某种奇怪的狂热在熊熊燃烧，使他夜不能眠。他同艺术学校里邻座的女孩子结了婚，住在布鲁克林的一间公寓里。他的妻子生了两个孩子，伊诺克则在一家广告公司找了一份画插图的工作。","Then Enoch Robinson got married.He began to get lonely and to want to touch actual flesh-and-bone people with his hands.Days passed when his room seemed empty.Lust visited his body and desire grew in his mind.At night strange fevers, burning within, kept him awake.He married a girl who sat in a chair next to his own in the art school and went to live in an apartment house in Brooklyn.Two children were born to the woman he married, and Enoch got a job in a place where illustrations are made for advertisements."
"伊诺克的生活进入了一个新的阶段。他开始玩一种新游戏。有一段时间，他为自己繁衍后代的角色感到非常自豪。他摒弃了事物的本质，玩起了现实游戏。秋天的时候，他在一次选举中投了票，还订了一份报纸。报纸每天清晨被送到他家走廊上。傍晚，他下班回家，从电车上下来，跟在某个生意人的身后庄重地走着。他努力使自己看上去显赫又高贵。作为纳税人，他感到有必要使自己了解社会的运作。“我一定会在某个时刻，在州里、城里等等，有所作为的。”他带着一种略微有趣的神气庄重地对自己说。一次，他从费城回家，在火车上同一个男人做了一次交谈。伊诺克谈到了由政府持有和运作铁路是明智之举，那名男子递给了他一支雪茄。在他看来，政府做这样一个举措将是件好事，于是他说着说着就变得相当激动起来。后来，他满心愉悦地回忆自己的言论。“我给了他一些事情思考，那个家伙。”他在爬布鲁克林公寓楼梯的时候这样喃喃自语道。","That began another phase of Enoch’s life.He began to play at a new game.For a while he was very proud of himself in the role of producing citizen of the world.He dismissed the essence of things and played with realities.In the fall he voted at an election and he had a newspaper thrown on his porch each morning.When in the evening he came home from work he got off a streetcar and walked sedately along behind some business man, striving to look very substantial and important.As a payer of taxes he thought he should post himself on how things are run.“I’m getting to be of some moment, a real part of things, of the state and the city and all that,” he told himself with an amusing miniature air of dignity.Once, coming home from Philadelphia, he had a discussion with a man met on a train.Enoch talked about the advisability of the government’s owning and operating the railroads and the man gave him a cigar.It was Enoch’s notion that such a move on the part of the government would be a good thing, and he grew quite excited as he talked.Later he remembered his own words with pleasure.“I gave him something to think about, that fellow,” he muttered to himself as he climbed the stairs to his Brooklyn apartment."
"可以确定的是，伊诺克的婚姻也不成功。他自己将它结束了。他开始感到公寓里的生活局促而令人窒息，于是觉得他的妻子甚至是孩子们都像那些曾经来拜访他的朋友一样令人厌烦。他开始撒些小谎，假借工作会面使自己能自由地夜晚到街上独自散步。机缘巧合下，他悄悄地重新租下了华盛顿广场对面的那个房间。后来，阿尔·鲁滨孙太太在温斯堡边上的农场里去世了。他从托管她房产的银行里得到了八千美金的遗产。这使得伊诺克彻底地从男人的世界里脱身出来。他将钱给了妻子，告诉她自己不能再住在公寓里了。她哭着，气急败坏地威胁他，可他仅仅望了她一眼就扬长而去了。事实上，这位妻子也并不太在意。她觉得伊诺克有轻微的精神失常，有些怕他。当确信他永远都不会再回来后，她带着两个孩子去了康涅狄格州的一个村庄；她当姑娘时曾住在那里。最后，她嫁给一个买卖地产的商人，心满意足。","To be sure, Enoch’s marriage did not turn out.He himself brought it to an end.He began to feel choked and walled in by the life in the apartment, and to feel toward his wife and even toward his children as he had felt concerning the friends who once came to visit him.He began to tell little lies about business engagements that would give him freedom to walk alone in the street at night and, the chance offering, he secretly rerented the room facing Washington Square.Then Mrs. Al Robinson died on the farm near Winesburg, and he got eight thousand dollars from the bank that acted as trustee of her estate.That took Enoch out of the world of men altogether.He gave the money to his wife and told her he could not live in the apartment any more.She cried and was angry and threatened, but he only stared at her and went his own way.In reality the wife did not care much.She thought Enoch slightly insane and was a little afraid of him.When it was quite sure that he would never come back, she took the two children and went to a village in Connecticut where she had lived as a girl.In the end she married a man who bought and sold real estate and was contented enough."
"于是，伊诺克·鲁滨孙呆在纽约的那间房子里，同幻想中的人们在一起，跟他们玩乐、交谈，高兴得像孩子一样。他们是古怪的一群人，是伊诺克的人。我想，他们是他根据所见过的真人创造出来的，而这些人身上有些隐晦的原因吸引了他。其中有个单手握剑的女人，一个长着长长的白胡子的老头，身边总跟着一条狗，还有一个年轻姑娘，她的长袜子总是掉下来，悬在鞋尖上。伊诺克·鲁滨孙的童心创造出来了应该有二十多个幻想人物，他们都同他住在这个房间里。","And so Enoch Robinson stayed in the New York room among the people of his fancy, playing with them, talking to them, happy as a child is happy.They were an odd lot, Enoch’s people.They were made, I suppose, out of real people he had seen and who had for some obscure reason made an appeal to him.There was a woman with a sword in her hand, an old man with a long white beard who went about followed by a dog, a young girl whose stockings were always coming down and hanging over her shoe tops.There must have been two dozens of the shadow people, invented by the child-mind of Enoch Robinson, who lived in the room with him."
"伊诺克非常愉快。他一进屋就锁上门。他以一种荒谬的郑重口吻高声谈话、发号施令、品评生活。他快乐而心满意足地继续在广告公司工作养活自己，直到一件事发生。当然会有事发生。正是因为如此，他才回到温斯堡生活，我们才能了解他。事情是一个女人引起的。总是这样。他太高兴了。势必会有些东西闯入他的世界。势必会有些东西将他从纽约的那间房子里赶出去，过一种不起眼的、愚蠢的小人物的生活，让他在傍晚时分，在太阳落到韦斯利·莫耶的马车出租行后面的屋檐下时，在俄亥俄州一个小镇的街道上快速地四处走动，。","And Enoch was happy.Into the room he went and locked the door.With an absurd air of importance he talked aloud, giving instructions, making comments on life.He was happy and satisfied to go on making his living in the advertising place until something happened.Of course something did happen.That is why he went back to live in Winesburg and why we know about him.The thing that happened was a woman.It would be that way.He was too happy.Something had to come into his world.Something had to drive him out of the New York room to live out his life an obscure, jerky little figure, bobbing up and down on the streets of an Ohio town at evening when the sun was going down behind the roof of Wesley Moyer’s livery barn."
"关于发生的这件事情，伊诺克在某个夜晚告诉了乔治·威拉德。他想对某个人说，于是选择了这位年轻的报社记者，因为他们碰巧遇到一起的时候，更年轻的那个人有心情去理解他。","About the thing that happened, Enoch told George Willard about it one night.He wanted to talk to someone, and he chose the young newspaper reporter because the two happened to be thrown together at a time when the younger man was in a mood to understand."
"对青春的感伤，这种年轻人特有的悲哀情绪——一个长在乡村的少年在年底岁末的悲哀情绪——使老人张开了口。这种悲哀在乔治·威拉德的心中，虽毫无意义，却吸引了伊诺克·鲁滨孙。","Youthful sadness, young man’s sadness, the sadness of a growing boy in a village at the year’s end, opened the lips of the old man.The sadness was in the heart of George Willard and was without meaning, but it appealed to Enoch Robinson."
"他们两人遇见并交谈的那个傍晚下着雨；那是一个淅淅沥沥的十月阴雨天。收获的季节已经到来，夜晚天上本应是一轮圆月，空气中透出霜冻将至的清新凛冽的气息，可那天却不是这样。天上下着雨，小水坑里的水在大街的路灯下闪着光。集市广场那边漆黑一片的树林里，水从黑黢黢的树上滴下来。树下，湿漉漉的树叶粘在从地下突起的树根上。在温斯堡每家的后花园里，干瘪枯萎的土豆藤蔓在地面上蔓延。男人们吃过晚饭，本打算到镇上商店的后面去同其他人谈天，现在都改变了主意。乔治·威拉德在雨里大步行走，为下雨感到高兴。他有那种感觉。他就像是伊诺克·鲁滨孙；傍晚时这位老人走出他的房间，来到街头独自漫步。他很像他，只是乔治已经长成了一个高个子的年轻男人，而且不认为哭泣且一贯为之是男子汉所为。他的母亲已经重病一个月了，这和他的悲伤有些关系，但关系不大。他想到了自己，对年轻人来说，这总是会引发悲伤的。","It rained on the evening when the two met and talked, a drizzly wet October rain.The fruition of the year had come and the night should have been fine with a moon in the sky and the crisp sharp promise of frost in the air, but it wasn’t that way.It rained and little puddles of water shone under the street lamps on Main Street.In the woods in the darkness beyond the Fair Ground, water dripped from the black trees.Beneath the trees wet leaves were pasted against tree roots that protruded from the ground.In gardens back of houses in Winesburg dry shriveled potato vines lay sprawling on the ground.Men who had finished the evening meal and who had planned to go uptown to talk the evening away with other men at the back of some store changed their minds.George Willard tramped about in the rain and was glad that it rained.He felt that way.He was like Enoch Robinson on the evenings when the old man came down out of his room and wandered alone in the streets.He was like that only that George Willard had become a tall young man and did not think it manly to weep and carry on.For a month his mother had been very ill and that had something to do with his sadness, but not much.He thought about himself and to the young that always brings sadness."
"伊诺克·鲁滨孙和乔治·威拉德在一个木头雨蓬下相遇。那个雨篷一直延伸出去，直到位于莫米大街的沃伊特马车行前面的人行道上。莫米大街刚好是从温斯堡大街分岔出来的。他们从那里开始同行，穿过被雨冲刷过的街道，来到老人在赫夫纳街区三楼的房间里。年轻的记者是非常乐意前往的。伊诺克·鲁滨孙在两人交谈了十分钟后邀请他来家里。这个年轻人有些害怕，可生平他从没有这么好奇过。他曾经上百次听人们说这个老头有些神经错乱，他觉得自己去他的家是相当勇敢而充满男子汉气概的举动。最初，在雨中的街道上时，这个老人用一种奇怪的方式说着，试图讲述华盛顿广场那个房间的故事和他在里面的生活。“如果你认真地试过了，就会明白。”他肯定地说道，“你在街上经过我身边时，我已经看到你了，我想你能明白。这并不难。你需要做的就是相信我所说的，只要听和相信，那就足够了。”","Enoch Robinson and George Willard met beneath a wooden awning that extended out over the sidewalk before Voight’s wagon shop on Maumee Street just off the main street of Winesburg.They went together from there through the rain-washed streets to the older man’s room on the third floor of the Heffner Block.The young reporter went willingly enough.Enoch Robinson asked him to go after the two had talked for ten minutes.The boy was a little afraid but had never been more curious in his life.A hundred times he had heard the old man spoken of as a little off his head and he thought himself rather brave and manly to go at all.From the very beginning, in the street in the rain, the old man talked in a queer way, trying to tell the story of the room in Washington Square and of his life in the room.“You’ll understand if you try hard enough,” he said conclusively.“I have looked at you when you went past me on the street and I think you can understand.It isn’t hard.All you have to do is to believe what I say, just listen and believe, that’s all there is to it.”"
"那天夜里，在赫夫纳街区的房间里，当老伊诺克对乔治讲到故事的关键，就是那个女人和那件将他最终赶出那座城市，并在温斯堡里孤独终老、一败涂地的事情时，时针已经指过了十一点。他坐在窗边的一张简易床上，手捧着头，乔治·威拉德则坐在桌子旁的一张椅子上。桌上放着一盏煤油灯，尽管房间里没什么家具，却收拾得极其整洁。当老人讲述的时候，乔治·威拉德开始觉得他宁愿从椅子上起来，也坐到那张床上去。他想抱住那个瘦小的老头。在半明半暗间，老人说着，年轻人听着，内心充满了悲伤。","It was past eleven o’clock that evening when old Enoch, talking to George Willard in the room in the Heffner Block, came to the vital thing, the story of the woman and of what drove him out of the city to live out his life alone and defeated in Winesburg.He sat on a cot by the window with his head in his hand and George Willard was in a chair by a table.A kerosene lamp sat on the table and the room, although almost bare of furniture, was scrupulously clean.As the man talked George Willard began to feel that he would like to get out of the chair and sit on the cot also.He wanted to put his arms about the little old man.In the half darkness the man talked and the boy listened, filled with sadness."
"“在那个房间空寂了多年后，她闯了进来。”伊诺克说道，“她在房子的走廊里看见的我，于是我们便认识了。我现在都不知道她到底在自己的屋子里做什么。我从没进过她的房间。我认为她是个音乐家，拉小提琴。她时常过来敲门，我就把门打开。她进来坐在我身边，就那么坐着四处看着，什么也没说。无论怎样，她没说过一句要紧的话。”","“She got to coming in there after there hadn’t been anyone in the room for years,” said Enoch Robinson.“She saw me in the hallway of the house and we got acquainted.I don’t know just what she did in her own room.I never went there.I think she was a musician and played a violin.Every now and then she came and knocked at the door and I opened it.In she came and sat down beside me, just sat and looked about and said nothing.Anyway, she said nothing that mattered.”"
"老人从床上站起身，在房间里四处走动。他穿的外套在雨里淋湿了，雨水一直往下滴，在地板上发出柔和低沉的滴答声。当他再次坐到床上的时候，乔治·威拉德从椅子上起来，坐到了他的身边。","The old man arose from the cot and moved about the room.The overcoat he wore was wet from the rain and drops of water kept falling with a soft thump on the floor.When he again sat upon the cot George Willard got out of the chair and sat beside him."
"“我对她产生了感情。她就和我坐在房间里，可她相对那房间来说太大了。我感到她正在把其他的东西都赶出去。我们就谈些琐碎的小事，可我无法坐着不动。我想要用手指触摸她，亲吻她。她的手很强壮，面庞生得很美，而她总是望着我。”","“I had a feeling about her.She sat there in the room with me and she was too big for the room.I felt that she was driving everything else away.We just talked of little things, but I couldn’t sit still.I wanted to touch her with my fingers and to kiss her.Her hands were so strong and her face was so good and she looked at me all the time.”"
"老人颤抖的声音沉寂了下来，身体像是怕冷似的发着抖。“我害怕，”他低声说，“我非常害怕。她敲门的时候我不想让她进来，可我无法坐着不动。‘不，不，’我对自己说，可我还是站起来开了门。你看，她是那么成熟。她是个女人。我想，在那间屋子里她会比我还大。”","The trembling voice of the old man became silent and his body shook as from a chill.“I was afraid,” he whispered.“I was terribly afraid. I didn’t want to let her come in when she knocked at the door but I couldn’t sit still.‘No, no,’ I said to myself, but I got up and opened the door just the same.She was so grown up, you see.She was a woman.I thought she would be bigger than I was there in that room.”"
"伊诺克·鲁滨孙注视着乔治·威拉德，他那双孩子般的蓝眼睛在灯光中熠熠生辉。他再次颤抖起来。“我想要她，可我又总是不想她来。”他解释道，“于是我开始告诉她我的那帮朋友，以及那些对我意义重大的每件事。我试图保持安静，独善其身，可我做不到。我感到就像我要去开门一样。有时，我让她离开，再不要回来，这使我感到很痛苦。”","Enoch Robinson stared at George Willard, his childlike blue eyes shining in the lamplight.Again he shivered.“I wanted her and all the time I didn’t want her,” he explained.“Then I began to tell her about my people, about everything that meant anything to me.I tried to keep quiet, to keep myself to myself, but I couldn’t.I felt just as I did about opening the door.Sometimes I ached to have her go away and never come back any more.”"
"老人跳起来，声音因为激动而发抖。“一天晚上，事情发生了。我发疯似的想让她弄懂我，让她了解在那个房间里我是多么重要。我希望她能看到我的重要。我一遍又一遍地告诉她。当她试图离开的时候，我跑过去锁上了门。我跟着她。我不停地说，突然，事情搞砸了。她的眼睛里露出一种神情，我知道她真的明白了。也许她一直都是明白的。我勃然大怒。我无法忍受。我希望她了解，可是，难道你不懂吗，我又不能让她明白。你看，那时我感到她会明白一切的，我会被淹没、被溺死。就是这么回事。我也莫名其妙。”","The old man sprang to his feet and his voice shook with excitement.“One night something happened.I became mad to make her understand me and to know what a big thing I was in that room.I wanted her to see how important I was.I told her over and over.When she tried to go away, I ran and locked the door.I followed her about.I talked and talked and then all of a sudden things went to smash.A look came into her eyes and I knew she did understand.Maybe she had understood all the time.I was furious.I couldn’t stand it.I wanted her to understand but, don’t you see, I couldn’t let her understand.I felt that then she would know everything, that I would be submerged, drowned out, you see.That’s how it is.I don’t know why.”"
"老人倒在灯旁的一张椅子上，而年轻人倾听着，心中充满敬畏。“走吧，孩子。”老头说，“别再在这儿跟我呆在一块儿了。我原以为告诉你会是件好事，可却不是的。我不想再说了。你走吧。”","The old man dropped into a chair by the lamp and the boy listened, filled with awe.“Go away, boy,” said the man.“Don’t stay here with me any more.I thought it might be a good thing to tell you but it isn’t.I don’t want to talk any more.Go away.”"
"乔治·威拉德摇头，声音里带着一种命令的口吻。“别现在停下来。告诉我接下来的故事。”他厉声命令道，“发生了什么？告诉我下面的故事。”","George Willard shook his head and a note of command came into his voice.“Don’t stop now.Tell me the rest of it,” he commanded sharply.“What happened?Tell me the rest of the story.”"
"伊诺克·鲁滨孙跳起来，跑到窗边，从那儿可以看到空无一人的温斯堡大街。乔治·威拉德跟了上去。两个人站在窗边，一个是高大而笨拙的男孩般的男人，一个是矮小的、长满皱纹的男人模样的男孩。那孩子气的、急切的声音继续讲述着故事。“我咒骂她。”他解释道，“我说了些下流话。我命令她离开，再也别回来。噢，我说了些很糟糕的话。起初，她假装不懂，可我一直在说。我尖叫着，在地板上跺着脚。我弄得整间屋子都充满了我的咒骂声。我从未想过再见到她，我知道，在我说过那些话之后，我再不会见到她了。”","Enoch Robinson sprang to his feet and ran to the window that looked down into the deserted main street of Winesburg.George Willard followed.By the window the two stood, the tall awkward boy-man and the little wrinkled man-boy.The childish, eager voice carried forward the tale.“I swore at her,” he explained.“I said vile words.I ordered her to go away and not to come back.Oh, I said terrible things.At first she pretended not to understand but I kept at it.I screamed and stamped on the floor.I made the house ring with my curses.I didn’t want ever to see her again and I knew, after some of the things I said, that I never would see her again.”"
"老人的声音停顿了一下，他摇摇头。“事情都弄砸了。”他静静地、哀伤地说，“她穿过门离开了，房间里曾有的所有生活都随着她离去了。她带走了我所有的人物。他们都随着她穿过门离去了。就是这么回事。”","The old man’s voice broke and he shook his head.“Things went to smash,” he said quietly and sadly.“Out she went through the door and all the life there had been in the room followed her out.She took all of my people away. They all went out through the door after her.That’s the way it was.”"
"乔治·威拉德转身离开了伊诺克·鲁滨孙的房间。当他穿过房门的时候，他能听见那个单薄而苍老的声音在窗边的黑暗里呜咽、抱怨。“我孑然一身，在这里我是完全孤独的。”那个声音说道，“我的房间里曾经温暖友好，可现在，我是完全孤独了。”","George Willard turned and went out of Enoch Robinson’s room.In the darkness by the window, as he went through the door, he could hear the thin old voice whimpering and complaining.“I’m alone, all alone here,” said the voice.“It was warm and friendly in my room but now I’m all alone.”"
"第十五章 一次觉醒","Chapter 15 An Awakening"
"贝尔·卡彭特皮肤黝黑，有着灰色的眼睛和厚厚的嘴唇。她个子很高，身体强壮。当烦闷涌上心头的时候，她就感到愤怒，希望自己是个男人，可以用拳头和谁打一架。她在凯特·麦克林太太的女帽店里工作，白天就坐在店后面的窗户边装饰各种帽子。她是温斯堡第一国家银行记账员亨利·卡彭特的女儿。她同父亲住在很远的七叶树街尾一间阴暗古老的房子里。屋子的四周长着松柏，可树下却寸草不生。屋后有一根生锈的檐槽在接头处松脱了。一起风，它就敲打着一间小棚子的屋顶，发出沉闷的击鼓声，有时还会响上一整晚。","Belle Carpenter had a dark skin, grey eyes, and thick lips.She was tall and strong.When black thoughts visited her she grew angry and wished she were a man and could fight someone with her fists.She worked in the millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate McHugh and during the day sat trimming hats by a window at the rear of the store.She was the daughter of Henry Carpenter, bookkeeper in the First National Bank of Winesburg, and lived with him in a gloomy old house far out at the end of Buckeye Street.The house was surrounded by pine trees and there was no grass beneath the trees.A rusty tin eavestrough had slipped from its fastenings at the back of the house and when the wind blew it beat against the roof of a small shed, making a dismal drumming noise that sometimes persisted all through the night."
"在贝尔还是个小姑娘的时候，亨利·卡彭特把生活弄得让她难以忍受，但当她从女孩子变成女人后，他就无力管她了。这位记账员的生活是由数不尽的琐碎小事组成的。早上去银行上班的时候，他走进衣帽间，穿上一件因年久而变得破旧的黑色驼毛外套。晚上回家以后，他再换上另一件黑色驼毛外套。每天晚上，他把出门上街穿的衣服熨好。为此，他还发明了一种木板装置。他将上街穿的裤子放在木板中间，然后用大螺丝将木板夹在一起。早上，他用一块湿抹布擦拭木板，然后让它们直立在餐厅的门后。如果谁在白天移动了木板，他就会气得不说话，一个星期都平复不了。这个记账员有一点儿欺软怕硬，而且怕他女儿。他明白，他的女儿知道他曾经虐待过她的母亲，并为此憎恨他。一天中午，她回到家，手里捧着一把从路边弄来的烂泥进了屋。她把泥巴糊在夹裤子的木板上，然后觉得出了口气，高兴地回去上班了。","When she was a young girl Henry Carpenter made life almost unbearable for Belle, but as she emerged from girlhood into womanhood he lost his power over her.The bookkeeper’s life was made up of innumerable little pettinesses. When he went to the bank in the morning he stepped into a closet and put on a black alpaca coat that had become shabby with age.At night when he returned to his home he donned another black alpaca coat.Every evening he pressed the clothes worn in the streets.He had invented an arrangement of boards for the purpose.The trousers to his street suit were placed between the boards and the boards were clamped together with heavy screws. In the morning he wiped the boards with a damp cloth and stood them upright behind the dining room door.If they were moved during the day he was speechless with anger and did not recover his equilibrium for a week.The bank cashier was a little bully and was afraid of his daughter.She, he realized, knew the story of his brutal treatment of her mother and hated him for it.One day she went home at noon and carried a handful of soft mud, taken from the road, into the house.With the mud she smeared the face of the boards used for the pressing of trousers and then went back to her work feeling relieved and happy."
"贝尔·卡彭特偶尔和乔治·威拉德在晚上出去散步。她偷偷地爱着另一个男人，可这份无人知晓的暗恋弄得她极其烦躁。她爱上的是埃德·汉德比，埃德·格里菲思酒吧的酒保。她和年轻的记者出门只不过是她感情的一种宣泄罢了。她觉得自己的社会地位是不允许她同那名酒保结伴而行的。她同乔治·威拉德在树林下走走，让他亲吻自己，可以让她内心的强烈渴望得到慰藉。她觉得她能让这个年轻的男人不越界。可对于埃德·汉德比，她可就没把握了。这个酒保是个高个子、肩膀宽阔的三十岁男人，住在格里菲思酒吧楼上的一间房里。他的拳头很大，眼睛却异常小，但似乎是想要努力隐藏那双拳头的威力似的，他的声音既轻柔又平静。在这个酒保二十五岁的时候，他从印第安纳州的一个叔叔那里继承了一个大农场。埃德只用了六个月的时间就花光了卖掉农场得到的八千美金。他来到伊利湖边的桑达斯基，过上了花天酒地的放荡生活。这个故事后来让他的乡亲们敬畏有加。","Belle Carpenter occasionally walked out in the evening with George Willard.Secretly she loved another man, but her love affair, about which no one knew, caused her much anxiety.She was in love with Ed Handby, bartender in Ed Griffith’s Saloon, and went about with the young reporter as a kind of relief to her feelings.She did not think that her station in life would permit her to be seen in the company of the bartender and walked about under the trees with George Willard and let him kiss her to relieve a longing that was very insistent in her nature.She felt that she could keep the younger man within bounds.About Ed Handby she was somewhat uncertain.Handby, the bartender, was a tall, broad-shouldered man of thirty who lived in a room upstairs above Griffith’s saloon.His fists were large and his eyes unusually small, but his voice, as though striving to conceal the power back of his fists, was soft and quiet.At twenty-five the bartender had inherited a large farm from an uncle in Indiana.When sold, the farm brought in eight thousand dollars, which Ed spent in six months.Going to Sandusky, on Lake Erie, he began an orgy of dissipation, the story of which afterward filled his hometown with awe."
"他四处挥霍，驾着马车穿街走巷，设酒宴款待男男女女，下大注赌牌，还包养情妇，她们的衣服就花了他几百美金。","Here and there he went throwing the money about, driving carriages through the streets, giving wine parties to crowds of men and women, playing cards for high stakes and keeping mistresses whose wardrobes cost him hundreds of dollars."
"一天晚上，在一个名叫雪松点的游乐场里，他和人打了一架，那疯狂的样子就像一头野兽。他用拳头打碎了酒店洗手间里的一面大镜子，后来又在舞厅里砸窗户、摔椅子，为的不过是以图一乐，听听玻璃碎在地板上的声音，看看那些从桑达斯基带着情人来此消磨夜晚的职员们眼里露出的惊慌神色。","One night at a resort called Cedar Point, he got into a fight and ran amuck like a wild thing.With his fist he broke a large mirror in the wash room of a hotel and later went about smashing windows and breaking chairs in dance halls for the joy of hearing the glass rattle on the floor and seeing the terror in the eyes of clerks who had come from Sandusky to spend the evening at the resort with their sweethearts."
"埃德·汉德比与贝尔·卡彭特从表面上看其实没什么暧昧。","The affair between Ed Handby and Belle Carpenter on the surface amounted to nothing."
"他曾经得以和她晚上同行，但只有一晚。那晚，他从韦斯利·莫耶的马车出租行租了一匹马和一辆马车，带着她去兜风。他深信她就是自己想要的女人，因此他必须要让她依靠自己过活，于是他将自己的渴望告诉了他。酒保已经做好准备结婚，开始努力赚钱养家，可是，他的性格太过单纯，很难将他的心意说明白。他的身体因生理的渴望而疼痛，他便用身体来表达自己。他将这位女帽店店员揽在怀里，不顾她的挣扎紧紧抱着她，吻她，直到她无计可施。后来，他将她带回镇上，让她下了马车。“等我再次抱住你，我就不会再让你离开。","He had succeeded in spending but one evening in her company.On that evening he hired a horse and buggy at Wesley Moyer’s livery barn and took her for a drive.The conviction that she was the woman his nature demanded and that he must get her settled upon him and he told her of his desires.The bartender was ready to marry and to begin trying to earn money for the support of his wife, but so simple was his nature that he found it difficult to explain his intentions.His body ached with physical longing and with his body he expressed himself.Taking the milliner into his arms and holding her tightly in spite of her struggles, he kissed her until she became helpless.Then he brought her back to town and let her out of the buggy.“When I get hold of you again I’ll not let you go."
"你不能玩弄我。”他说着，掉转身打算驾车离开。接着，他跳下马车，用强壮的双手抓住她的肩膀。“下一次，我永远不会放手了。”他说，“你还是打定主意吧。这是我跟你两个人的事，我等不及安排好就想娶你了。”","You can’t play with me,” he declared as he turned to drive away.Then, jumping out of the buggy, he gripped her shoulders with his strong hands.“I’ll keep you for good the next time,” he said.“You might as well make up your mind to that.It’s you and me for it and I’m going to have you before I get through.”"
"一月的某个夜晚，天上挂着一弯新月，乔治·威拉德外出散步。在埃德·汉德比看来，他是自己迎娶贝尔·卡彭特的唯一障碍。当晚早些时候，乔治同赛思·里士满和本镇屠夫的儿子阿特·威尔逊一起进了兰塞姆·塞柏克的台球厅。赛思·里士满德背靠墙站着，一言不发，可乔治·威拉德在说话。台球厅里都是温斯堡的年轻男孩，他们谈到了女人。年轻的记者便插了进去。他说女人们应当自己当心，同姑娘们外出的小伙子们可不会对发生的事情负责。他说的时候望着周围，希望引起注意。他讲了五分钟，接着阿特·威尔逊就开口了。阿特在卡尔·普劳斯的店里学习理发，并开始认为自己在棒球、赛马、喝酒和玩女人这些方面已经是个老手了。他开始讲起某个夜晚他和两个温斯堡男人到镇政府的妓院去的事情。这名屠夫的儿子在嘴边叼了根雪茄，当他说话的时候，就吐在了地板上。“那地方的女人才不会让我觉得害臊，哪怕她们费力地想要那么干。”他吹嘘道，“其中的一个妓女想要搞点新花样，可我耍了她。她一开始说话，我就走过去坐在了她的大腿上。我吻她的时候，全屋的人都放声大笑起来。我让她不要惹我。”","One night in January when there was a new moon George Willard, who was in Ed Handby’s mind the only obstacle to his getting Belle Carpenter, went for a walk.Early that evening George went into Ransom Surbeck’s pool room with Seth Richmond and Art Wilson, son of the town butcher.Seth Richmond stood with his back against the wall and remained silent, but George Willard talked.The pool room was filled with Winesburg boys and they talked of women.The young reporter got into that vein.He said that women should look out for themselves, that the fellow who went out with a girl was not responsible for what happened.As he talked he looked about, eager for attention.He held the floor for five minutes and then Art Wilson began to talk.Art was learning the barber’s trade in Cal Prouse’s shop and already began to consider himself an authority in such matters as baseball, horse racing, drinking, and going about with women.He began to tell of a night when he with two men from Winesburg went into a house of prostitution at the county seat.The butcher’s son held a cigar in the side of his mouth and as he talked spat on the floor.“The women in the place couldn’t embarrass me although they tried hard enough,” he boasted.“One of the girls in the house tried to get fresh, but I fooled her.As soon as she began to talk I went and sat in her lap.Everyone in the room laughed when I kissed her.I taught her to let me alone.”"
"乔治·威拉德走出台球厅，来到大街上。连日来，天气酷寒，劲风从十八英里以北的伊利湖直吹到镇上。可是那个晚上却没有风，一弯新月使夜色变得分外可爱。没想到去哪儿，也没想要做什么，乔治走出大街，开始在灯光昏暗、两旁满是木板房的街道上走着。","George Willard went out of the pool room and into Main Street.For days the weather had been bitter cold with a high wind blowing down on the town from Lake Erie, eighteen miles to the north, but on that night the wind had died away and a new moon made the night unusually lovely.Without thinking where he was going or what he wanted to do, George went out of Main Street and began walking in dimly lighted streets filled with frame houses."
"在这缀满星星的漆黑夜空下，他忘记了台球厅里的同伴们。因为天黑，路上只有他一个人，他开始高声自语。他玩心大发，先是模仿一个醉汉沿着街道踉踉跄跄地走，接着又想像自己是个穿着铮亮的、长及膝盖的皮靴的士兵，戴着佩剑，走路时发出铿锵的声音。一想到士兵，他又幻想自己是个长官，正在检阅面前一长排立正的队伍。他开始检查这些士兵的装备。他在一棵树前面停下来，开始训话。“你的背包不整齐。”他严厉地说，“这个问题我还要说多少遍？在这里，每样东西都必须有秩序。我们面前有个艰巨的任务，没有秩序，什么困难的任务都办不成。”","Out of doors under the black sky filled with stars he forgot his companions of the pool room.Because it was dark and he was alone he began to talk aloud.In a spirit of play he reeled along the street imitating a drunken man and then imagined himself a soldier clad in shining boots that reached to the knees and wearing a sword that jingled as he walked.As a soldier he pictured himself as an inspector, passing before a long line of men who stood at attention.He began to examine the accoutrements of the men.Before a tree he stopped and began to scold.“Your pack is not in order,” he said sharply.“How many times will I have to speak of this matter?Everything must be in order here.We have a difficult task before us and no difficult task can be done without order.”"
"年轻人被自己的话蛊惑了，跌跌撞撞地沿着木板人行道走着，越说越起劲儿。“军队是有纪律的，男人也一样。”他喃喃地说，陷入深思中。“纪律起源于琐碎小事，然后延伸到所有的事情上。每件小事都必须有秩序，人们工作的地方，他们的衣着，还有思想，都是如此。我自己就必须遵守秩序。我必须学习纪律。我必须使自己接触那些有秩序又伟大的东西，它们就像星星一样闪亮整个夜空。在我自己的小范围内，我必须开始去学习一些东西，开始用生命和纪律去付出，去大干一场，去工作。”","Hypnotized by his own words, the young man stumbled along the board sidewalk saying more words.“There is a law for armies and for men too,” he muttered, lost in reflection.“The law begins with little things and spreads out until it covers everything.In every little thing there must be order, in the place where men work, in their clothes, in their thoughts.I myself must be orderly.I must learn that law.I must get myself into touch with something orderly and big that swings through the night like a star.In my little way I must begin to learn something, to give and swing and work with life, with the law.”"
"乔治·威拉德在路灯旁的一道尖桩篱栅前停下来，身体开始发抖。在这样的念头出现之前，他从未想过这些，他也不知道它们从何而来。在那一刻，仿佛有个外来的声音一直在他散步的时候同他说话。他对自己的思绪感到又惊又喜，当他继续走的时候，再一次狂热地谈起这个问题。“走出兰塞姆·塞柏克的台球厅，像这样思考问题，”他低声说，“还是一个人呆着好。”如果我像阿特·威尔逊那样说话，那帮小子是能听懂。可是，他们不会懂得我刚在这里思考的一切。“","George Willard stopped by a picket fence near a street lamp and his body began to tremble.He had never before thought such thoughts as had just come into his head and he wondered where they had come from.For the moment it seemed to him that some voice outside of himself had been talking as he walked.He was amazed and delighted with his own mind and when he walked on again spoke of the matter with fervor.“To come out of Ransom Surbeck’s pool room and think things like that,” he whispered.“It is better to be alone.If I talked like Art Wilson the boys would understand me but they wouldn’t understand what I’ve been thinking down here.”"
"像二十年前的所有俄亥俄的小镇一样，温斯堡镇里也有一块特定的区域，里面住着打零工的人。由于工厂的时代还没有到来，工人们在田里干活，或者在铁路沿线上当护路工。他们一天工作十二个小时，辛劳一天的所得是一美元。他们住的房子很小，是用廉价的木料简单搭建而成的，后面有个花园。其中一些生活舒适点儿的人会养些奶牛或者一头猪，牲畜棚就建在花园的小棚子里。","In Winesburg, as in all Ohio towns of twenty years ago, there was a section in which lived day laborers.As the time of factories had not yet come, the laborers worked in the fields or were section hands on the railroads.They worked twelve hours a day and received one dollar for the long day of toil.The houses in which they lived were small cheaply constructed wooden affairs with a garden at the back.The more comfortable among them kept cows and perhaps a pig, housed in a little shed at the rear of the garden."
"在这个一月的晴朗夜空下，乔治·威拉德脑袋里回响着那些念头，走上了这样一条街。这条街上灯光昏暗，有的地方连人行道都没有。展现在他眼前的景象中，有些东西激起了他已经萌发的幻想。有一整年，他曾把所有的业余时间都用来阅读。现在，曾读过的那些关于中世纪古老城镇生活的故事清晰地出现在了他的脑海。于是，他蹒跚向前，有一种故地重游般的奇特感觉。冲动之下，他转出了街道，走进了一条阴暗的小巷。小巷位于关着奶牛和猪的牲畜棚后面。","With his head filled with resounding thoughts, George Willard walked into such a street on the clear January night.The street was dimly lighted and in places there was no sidewalk.In the scene that lay about him there was something that excited his already aroused fancy.For a year he had been devoting all of his odd moments to the reading of books and now some tale he had read concerning life in old world towns of the middle ages came sharply back to his mind so that he stumbled forward with the curious feeling of one revisiting a place that had been a part of some former existence.On an impulse he turned out of the street and went into a little dark alleyway behind the sheds in which lived the cows and pigs."
"他在那里呆了半个小时，闻着极为拥挤的牲畜棚里传来的臭味的同时，在脑袋里玩味着那突如其来的新奇念头。清新香甜的空气里充斥着肥料的臭气，唤醒了他脑海里某种兴奋的东西。简陋的小房子里面点着煤油灯，烟囱里冒出的烟直直地升上天空，猪的哼哼声，女人们穿着廉价的花布衣裳在厨房里洗盘子的声音，男人们离开房子、走进大街上的商店和酒吧的脚步声，狗的叫声，还有孩子们的哭声——所有一切使他看上去仿佛潜伏在黑暗中，怪异地超脱于众生之外。","For a half hour he stayed in the alleyway, smelling the strong smell of animals too closely housed and letting his mind play with the strange new thoughts that came to him.The very rankness of the smell of manure in the clear sweet air awoke something heady in his brain. The poor little houses lighted by kerosene lamps, the smoke from the chimneys mounting straight up into the clear air, the grunting of pigs, the women clad in cheap calico dresses and washing dishes in the kitchens, the footsteps of men coming out of the houses and going off to the stores and saloons of Main Street, the dogs barking and the children crying—all of these things made him seem, as he lurked in the darkness, oddly detached and apart from all life."
"兴奋的年轻人无法承受自己思想的重量，开始小心地沿着小巷前行。一条狗扑过来，被他用石头赶开了。接着,一栋房子的门前出现了一个男人，朝那条狗叫骂着。乔治来到一块空地上，仰起头望着天。他感到自己变得说不出的大，并且自己被这刚刚的简单体验给重塑了。他怀着一种狂热的情感把双手举过头顶，伸到黑暗之中，喃喃自语。想说点儿什么的欲望征服了他，他开始说些无意义的话。话语从他的舌尖滚落，之所以说这些话，是因为它们都是勇敢之词，意义重大。“死亡，”他喃喃地说，“黑夜，海洋，恐惧，美丽。”","The excited young man, unable to bear the weight of his own thoughts, began to move cautiously along the alleyway.A dog attacked him and had to be driven away with stones, and a man appeared at the door of one of the houses and swore at the dog.George went into a vacant lot and throwing back his head looked up at the sky.He felt unutterably big and remade by the simple experience through which he had been passing and in a kind of fervor of emotion put up his hands, thrusting them into the darkness above his head and muttering words.The desire to say words overcame him and he said words without meaning, rolling them over on his tongue and saying them because they were brave words, full of meaning.“Death,” he muttered, night, the sea, fear, loveliness.”"
"乔治·威拉德离开那片空地，重又站在房子对面的人行道上。他觉得那小街上的所有人都必定是他的手足，他希望自己能有勇气去将他们唤出屋来，同他们握手。“如果这里只有一个女人，我会牵着她的手一同奔跑，直到我们都精疲力竭为止。”他想，“那会让我好受些。”想到女人，他走出那条街，朝着贝尔·卡彭特住的房子走去。他觉得她能理解他的情绪，并且在她面前，他能做到他一直想达到的境地。以前，当他同她在一起并吻过她的双唇后，他对自己充满愤怒。他觉得自己像是被某种隐藏的目的利用了，因此并不享受这样的情感。现在，他觉得自己突然长大了，不会再被利用了。","George Willard came out of the vacant lot and stood again on the sidewalk facing the houses.He felt that all of the people in the little street must be brothers and sisters to him and he wished he had the courage to call them out of their houses and to shake their hands.“If there were only a woman here I would take hold of her hand and we would run until we were both tired out,” he thought.“That would make me feel better.”With the thought of a woman in his mind he walked out of the street and went toward the house where Belle Carpenter lived.He thought she would understand his mood and that he could achieve in her presence a position he had long been wanting to achieve.In the past when he had been with her and had kissed her lips he had come away filled with anger at himself.He had felt like one being used for some obscure purpose and had not enjoyed the feeling.Now he thought he had suddenly become too big to be used."
"当乔治来到贝尔·卡彭特的屋前时，那里已经有了一个拜访者。埃德·汉德比已到了门边，正在叫贝尔出来，想跟她说话。他想让这个女人同他一道离开，做他的妻子，可当她走出来站到门边的时候，他失去了自信，变得郁郁寡欢起来。“你离那个毛孩子远点儿。”想到乔治·威拉德，他怒吼起来。然后不知该说些什么，他便转身走了。“如果我再看到你们在一起，我就打断你的骨头，还有他的。”他加了一句。这个酒保原本是来求婚而非威胁的，却因自己的失败而生自己的气。","When George got to Belle Carpenter’s house there had already been a visitor there before him.Ed Handby had come to the door and calling Belle out of the house had tried to talk to her.He had wanted to ask the woman to come away with him and to be his wife, but when she came and stood by the door he lost his self-assurance and became sullen.“You stay away from that kid,” he growled, thinking of George Willard, and then, not knowing what else to say, turned to go away.“If I catch you together I will break your bones and his too,” he added.The bartender had come to woo, not to threaten, and was angry with himself because of his failure."
"当她的情人离开后，贝尔走进屋子，急急忙忙跑上楼。从房子上方的窗户里，她看到埃德·汉德比穿过街道，然后坐在邻居家门前的一块栓马石上。那个男人在昏暗的灯光下动也不动地坐着，双手捧着头。看到这个情景，她高兴起来。当乔治·威拉德来到门口时，她热情地欢迎了他，急忙戴上了帽子。她觉得，等她和年轻的威拉德散步穿过街道的时候，埃德·汉德比就会跟上来，她想让他不好受。","When her lover had departed Belle went indoors and ran hurriedly upstairs.From a window at the upper part of the house she saw Ed Handby cross the street and sit down on a horse block before the house of a neighbor.In the dim light the man sat motionless holding his head in his hands.She was made happy by the sight, and when George Willard came to the door she greeted him effusively and hurriedly put on her hat.She thought that, as she walked through the streets with young Willard, Ed Handby would follow and she wanted to make him suffer."
"在这夜晚甜蜜的空气中，贝尔·卡彭特和年轻记者在树林下走了快一个小时。乔治满口豪言壮语。在黑暗小巷中涌上来的力量仍留在他心中，他大胆地说着，挥动着双臂，大摇大摆地走着。他想让贝尔·卡彭特明白，他已经意识到了自己之前的不足，现在他已经改变了。“你会发现我变了。”他说道，手插在裤袋里，大胆地直视着她。“我也不知为何，可就是这样的。你必须把我当一个男人对待，要么就别来惹我。就是这么回事。”","For an hour Belle Carpenter and the young reporter walked about under the trees in the sweet night air.George Willard was full of big words.The sense of power that had come to him during the hour in the darkness in the alleyway remained with him and he talked boldly, swaggering along and swinging his arms about.He wanted to make Belle Carpenter realize that he was aware of his former weakness and that he had changed.“You’ll find me different,” he declared, thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking boldly into her eyes.“I don’t know why but it is so.You’ve got to take me for a man or let me alone.That’s how it is.”"
"一弯新月下，女人和男孩安静地在街道上来来回回地走着。乔治说完后，他们便转到了一条小街上，穿过一座桥，来到通往山坡上的小径。这座山从水库池塘那里开始，一直延伸到温斯堡的集市广场。山坡上长满了密密的灌木丛和小树，灌木丛中有小块的开阔地，上面覆盖着长长的草，现在草都变硬结冰了。","Up and down the quiet streets under the new moon went the woman and the boy.When George had finished talking they turned down a side street and went across a bridge into a path that ran up the side of a hill.The hill began at Waterworks Pond and climbed upward to the Winesburg Fair Grounds.On the hillside grew dense bushes and small trees and among the bushes were little open spaces carpeted with long grass, now stiff and frozen."
"乔治·威拉德跟在女人的身后往山上走，他的心开始跳得很快，肩膀也挺直了。突然，他肯定贝尔·卡彭特准备委身与他了。他觉得，在他身上表现出来的新力量已经在她身上起了作用，使她臣服了。这个想法使他感受到了男性的力量，几乎有些陶醉其中了。尽管他们一路上走来，她似乎没有听进去他说的话，这让他有些生气，可事实上她陪着他来到了这个地方，这打消了他所有的疑虑。“这是不同的。每件事都不同了。”他想着，抓住她的肩膀将她转过来，他站在那里看着她，眼睛里闪着骄傲的光。","As he walked behind the woman up the hill George Willard’s heart began to beat rapidly and his shoulders straightened. Suddenly he decided that Belle Carpenter was about to surrender herself to him.The new force that had manifested itself in him had, he felt, been at work upon her and had led to her conquest.The thought made him half drunk with the sense of masculine power.Although he had been annoyed that as they walked about she had not seemed to be listening to his words, the fact that she had accompanied him to this place took all his doubts away.“It is different.Everything has become different,” he thought and taking hold of her shoulder turned her about and stood looking at her, his eyes shining with pride."
"贝尔·卡彭特没有反抗。他亲吻她嘴唇的时候，她重重地倒在他怀里，同时越过他的肩膀看向黑夜。她的整个态度都在暗示着她在等待。像在小巷里一样，乔治·威拉德的思绪又回到了语言上，他紧紧地抱着这个女人，在寂静的黑夜中低声地说着。“欲望，”他低声说，“欲望、夜晚和女人。”","Belle Carpenter did not resist.When he kissed her upon the lips she leaned heavily against him and looked over his shoulder into the darkness.In her whole attitude there was a suggestion of waiting. Again, as in the alleyway, George Willard’s mind ran off into words and, holding the woman tightly he whispered the words into the still night.“Lust,” he whispered, “lust and night and women.”"
"乔治·威拉德没弄懂那晚在山坡上发生了什么事。后来，等他回到自己的房间，他想大哭一场，接着，因为愤怒和仇恨而变得几近疯狂。他恨贝尔·卡彭特，并确信他会恨她一辈子。在山坡上，他将那个女人带到了灌木丛中的一小片开阔地上，在她身边跪下来。正如同他在那些工人的房子旁边的空地上举起双手，为身上的新力量而满怀感激一样，他也在等着这个女人说些什么。此时，埃德·汉德比出现了。","George Willard did not understand what happened to him that night on the hillside.Later, when he got to his own room, he wanted to weep and then grew half insane with anger and hate.He hated Belle Carpenter and was sure that all his life he would continue to hate her.On the hillside he had led the woman to one of the little open spaces among the bushes and had dropped to his knees beside her.As in the vacant lot, by the laborers’ houses, he had put up his hands in gratitude for the new power in himself and was waiting for the woman to speak when Ed Handby appeared."
"这个酒保并不想打这个男孩，尽管在他看来，他正试图抢走他的女人。他明白打人没有必要，他有能力不用拳头来达成自己的目的。他抓住乔治的肩膀，把他给拉了起来，然后用一只手抓着这个男孩，同时看着坐在草地上的贝尔·卡彭特。接着，他的胳膊迅速向边上一抬，将年轻人远远地摔到了灌木丛里，随后他开始恐吓那个已经站起来的女人。“你不听话。”他粗暴地说，“我有点儿不想和你继续纠缠了。要不是我那么想要你，我才不来管你。”","The bartender did not want to beat the boy, who he thought had tried to take his woman away.He knew that beating was unnecessary, that he had power within himself to accomplish his purpose without using his fists.Gripping George by the shoulder and pulling him to his feet, he held him with one hand while he looked at Belle Carpenter seated on the grass.Then with a quick wide movement of his arm he sent the younger man sprawling away into the bushes and began to bully the woman, who had risen to her feet.“You’re no good,” he said roughly.“I’ve half a mind not to bother with you.I’d let you alone if I didn’t want you so much.”"
"乔治·威拉德在灌木丛里趴着，望着他眼前的情景，竭力去思考是怎么回事。他打算跳起来,扑向那个羞辱了他的男人。被痛打一顿似乎比这样被耻辱地扔到一边要好得多。","On his hands and knees in the bushes George Willard stared at the scene before him and tried hard to think.He prepared to spring at the man who had humiliated him.To be beaten seemed to be infinitely better than to be thus hurled ignominiously aside."
"年轻的记者三次跳起来扑向埃德·汉德比，每次都被调酒师抓住肩膀给扔回了灌木丛。年长些的男人看起来预备将这种练习无限地进行下去，可是乔治·威拉德的头撞在一棵树根上，静静地躺在那里。于是埃德·汉德比拽着贝尔，扬长而去。","Three times the young reporter sprang at Ed Handby and each time the bartender, catching him by the shoulder, hurled him back into the bushes.The older man seemed prepared to keep the exercise going indefinitely but George Willard’s head struck the root of a tree and he lay still.Then Ed Handby took Belle Carpenter by the arm and marched her away."
"乔治听见他们穿过灌木丛走出去。当他爬下山坡的时候，他的心情糟透了。他恨他自己，恨命运带给他如此奇耻大辱。当他回想起那小巷里独处的一小时，他感到迷惑了；他停下来在黑暗中倾听着，希望再次听见不久前使他充满勇气的外在之音。在他回家的路上再次来到了两边都是木板棚屋的街道上，可他无法忍受看到的景象，于是开始跑起来。他想尽快摆脱周围的一切，现在那些东西在他看来十分脏乱，稀疏平常。","George heard the man and woman making their way through the bushes.As he crept down the hillside his heart was sick within him.He hated himself and he hated the fate that had brought about his humiliation.When his mind went back to the hour alone in the alleyway he was puzzled and stopping in the darkness listened, hoping to hear again the voice outside himself that had so short a time before put new courage into his heart.When his way homeward led him again into the street of frame houses he could not bear the sight and began to run, wanting to get quickly out of the neighborhood that now seemed to him utterly squalid and commonplace."
"第十六章 “古怪”","Chapter 16 “Queer”"
"温斯堡镇里有一家考利父子商店。埃尔默·考利，年轻的小老板，正在紧贴在商店后面的一间简易木板棚屋里。他坐在一个箱子充当的座位上，从那里透过一面满是灰尘的窗户，他可以看见《温斯堡鹰报》的打印室。埃尔默正在给鞋子穿上新鞋带。鞋带不太好穿，他不得不把鞋子脱下来。他坐在那里看着一只袜子后跟上的大洞，一手还拿着鞋子。接着，他飞快地抬起头来，看到镇上唯一的报社记者乔治·威拉德正站在《鹰报》打印室的后门边，心不在焉地四处张望着。“好，好，接下来又是什么！”年轻人大叫道，手里还拿着一只鞋。他跳起来，从窗边悄悄地走开了。","From his seat on a box in the rough board shed that stuck like a burr on the rear of Cowley & Son’s store in Winesburg, Elmer Cowley, the junior member of the firm, could see through a dirty window into the printshop of the Winesburg Eagle.Elmer was putting new shoelaces in his shoes.They did not go in readily and he had to take the shoes off.With the shoes in his hand he sat looking at a large hole in the heel of one of his stockings.Then looking quickly up, he saw George Willard, the only newspaper reporter in Winesburg, standing at the back door of the Eagle printshop and staring absentmindedly about.“Well, well, what next!” exclaimed the young man with the shoes in his hand, jumping to his feet and creeping away from the window."
"埃尔默·考利的脸慢慢变红，双手开始颤抖。在考利父子商店里，一个犹太籍的旅行推销员站在柜台边上，正同他的父亲说话。他觉得那个记者能听到他们的谈话，这个想法让他怒火中烧。他站在棚屋的角落里，手里仍然拿着一只鞋，一只只穿着袜子的脚在木地板上跺着。","A flush crept into Elmer Cowley’s face and his hands began to tremble.In Cowley & Son’s store a Jewish traveling salesman stood by the counter talking to his father.He imagined the reporter could hear what was being said and the thought made him furious.With one of the shoes still held in his hand he stood in a corner of the shed and stamped with a stockinged foot upon the board floor."
"考利父子商店并不是朝着温斯堡大街的。它的正门开在莫米大街上，过去便是沃伊特马车行和一间给农夫们歇马的马棚。商店的旁边是一条横在大街商店背后的小巷，整天有运货马车和送料车来来往往，将货物运进运出。商店本身很难描述。威尔·亨德森曾经提到过一次，说它什么都卖又什么都不卖。商店朝着莫米大街的窗户上立着一块苹果桶大小的大煤块，以示此店接受燃煤的订单。在黑煤块的旁边放着三个蜂房的蜂蜜，都已经变成了褐色，木架子也脏兮兮的。","Cowley & Son’s store did not face the main street of Winesburg.The front was on Maumee Street and beyond it was Voight’s wagon shop and a shed for the sheltering of farmers’ horses.Beside the store an alleyway ran behind the main street stores and all day drays and delivery wagons, intent on bringing in and taking out goods, passed up and down.The store itself was indescribable.Will Henderson once said of it that it sold everything and nothing.In the window facing Maumee Street stood a chunk of coal as large as an apple barrel, to indicate that orders for coal were taken, and beside the black mass of the coal stood three combs of honey grown brown and dirty in their wooden frames."
"蜂蜜在商店的窗子上已经放了半年之久。同样出售的还有外衣衣架、有专利的吊带纽扣、罐装的屋顶油漆、瓶装风湿药以及咖啡替代品，它们同蜂蜜一起，耐心地等待着服务大众。","The honey had stood in the store window for six months.It was for sale as were also the coat hangers, patent suspender buttons, cans of roof paint, bottles of rheumatism cure, and a substitute for coffee that companioned the honey in its patient willingness to serve the public."
"站在店里听着那名旅行推销员喋喋不休的男人名叫埃比尼泽·考利，他是个瘦高个，看上去不怎么整洁。在他干瘦的脖子上长着一个老大的粉瘤，被盖下来的灰白色胡须遮住了一半。他身穿一件双排扣的男长礼服。这件外套原本是买来做结婚礼服的。在做商人之前，埃比尼泽是名农夫。婚后，周日时他穿着这件男礼服去教堂，周六下午则穿着进镇做买卖。自从他卖掉农场，成为一名商人之后，他便常常穿着它。时间久了，衣服开始发黄，上面满是油污点，可是埃比尼泽总觉得穿上它便衣着光鲜，可以白天去镇上。","Ebenezer Cowley, the man who stood in the store listening to the eager patter of words that fell from the lips of the traveling man, was tall and lean and looked unwashed.On his scrawny neck was a large wen partially covered by a grey beard.He wore a long Prince Albert coat.The coat had been purchased to serve as a wedding garment.Before he became a merchant Ebenezer was a farmer and after his marriage he wore the Prince Albert coat to church on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons when he came into town to trade.When he sold the farm to become a merchant he wore the coat constantly.It had become brown with age and was covered with grease spots, but in it Ebenezer always felt dressed up and ready for the day in town."
"作为商人的埃比尼泽生活得不快乐，可做农夫的时候，他也同样不快乐。可他还是生存着。他有一个女儿，名叫梅布尔，还有一个儿子。三人住在商店的楼上，生活的开销不大。他的苦恼并不是金钱方面的。他作为商人的不幸在于：当旅行推销员从前门进来，拿着物品来卖的时候，他便开始害怕。他站在柜台后面直摇头。他害怕的原因有：首先，如果他坚持不买，那么就失去了再卖出去的机会；其次，他往往不够坚持，会一时心软，买下卖不出去的东西。","As a merchant Ebenezer was not happily placed in life and he had not been happily placed as a farmer.Still he existed.His family, consisting of a daughter named Mabel and the son, lived with him in rooms above the store and it did not cost them much to live.His troubles were not financial.His unhappiness as a merchant lay in the fact that when a traveling man with wares to be sold came in at the front door he was afraid.Behind the counter he stood shaking his head.He was afraid, first that he would stubbornly refuse to buy and thus lose the opportunity to sell again; second that he would not be stubborn enough and would in a moment of weakness buy what could not be sold."
"这天早上，在商店里，当埃尔默·考利看见乔治·威拉德站在《鹰报》打印室的后门边，明显是在偷听的时候，这样一个总能激起他怒火的情况再次激怒了这位儿子。那名旅行推销员说着，埃比尼泽听着，他的整个身影传达出犹豫不决的信息。“你看这多快。”旅行推销员说道，他在推销一种小巧、扁平、能代替衣领纽扣的金属制品。他用一只手就迅速地解开了自己的衬衣衣领，然后又重新扣好了。他带着一副谄媚、哄骗的腔调。“我告诉你吧，人们就快不用这种愚蠢的衬衣纽扣了，你正好利用这个改变来赚钱。我把这个镇的独家代理权交给你。你只要买二十打这种别针，我就不再去别家店了。我把这个市场都留给你。”","In the store on the morning when Elmer Cowley saw George Willard standing and apparently listening at the back door of the Eagle printshop, a situation had arisen that always stirred the son’s wrath.The traveling man talked and Ebenezer listened, his whole figure expressing uncertainty.“You see how quickly it is done,” said the traveling man, who had for sale a small flat metal substitute for collar buttons.With one hand he quickly unfastened a collar from his shirt and then fastened it on again.He assumed a flattering wheedling tone.“I tell you what, men have come to the end of all this fooling with collar buttons and you are the man to make money out of the change that is coming.I am offering you the exclusive agency for this town.Take twenty dozen of these fasteners and I’ll not visit any other store.I’ll leave the field to you.”"
"旅行推销员靠在柜台上探过身去，用手指敲敲埃艾比尼泽的胸膛。“这可是个好机会，我希望你抓住它。”他怂恿道，“我的一个朋友向我提过你。‘去见见那个叫考利的人。’他说，‘他可是个有头脑的。’”","The traveling man leaned over the counter and tapped with his finger on Ebenezer’s breast.“It’s an opportunity and I want you to take it,” he urged.“A friend of mine told me about you.‘See that man Cowley,’ he said.‘He’s a live one.’”"
"旅行推销员停下来，等了会儿。他从口袋里拿出一个本子，开始写订单。埃尔默·考利还把那只鞋拿在手里。他穿过商店，经过聚精会神的两个人，然后来到前门边的一个玻璃陈列柜前。他从柜子里拿出一把廉价的手枪，开始上下挥舞。“你滚出去！”他尖叫道，“我们这里不需要什么衣领别针。”他忽然想到一个点子。“当心，我可不是在吓唬谁。”他加了一句，“我没说我会开枪。我也许不过是把枪从陈列柜里拿出来看看。可是，你最好滚出去。是的，先生，我就是这个意思。你最好拿好你的东西给我滚。”","The traveling man paused and waited.Taking a book from his pocket he began writing out the order.Still holding the shoe in his hand Elmer Cowley went through the store, past the two absorbed men, to a glass showcase near the front door.He took a cheap revolver from the case and began to wave it about.“You get out of here!” he shrieked.“We don’t want any collar fasteners here.”An idea came to him.“Mind, I’m not making any threat,” he added.“I don’t say I’ll shoot.Maybe I just took this gun out of the case to look at it.But you better get out.Yes sir, I’ll say that.You better grab up your things and get out.”"
"这个小老板的声音高得像在尖叫，他走到柜台后面，朝那两人走过去。“我们在这儿是彻头彻尾的傻瓜！”他喊道，“等我们开始卖得出东西才进货。我们不打算再这么古怪下去，引得别人偷看或偷听。你给我滚出去！”","The young storekeeper’s voice rose to a scream and going behind the counter he began to advance upon the two men.“We’re through being fools here!” he cried.“We ain’t going to buy any more stuff until we begin to sell.We ain’t going to keep on being queer and have folks staring and listening. You get out of here!”"
"那名旅行推销员离开了。他把柜台上的衣领别针样品扫进一个黑皮包里，然后落荒而逃。他是个矮个子男人，罗圈腿很严重，跑步的样子十分笨拙。那个黑皮包勾在门上，让他跌跌撞撞地摔了一跤。“疯了，他真的是——疯了！”他一边气急败坏地说着，一边从人行道上爬起来，急忙跑了。","The traveling man left.Raking the samples of collar fasteners off the counter into a black leather bag, he ran.He was a small man and very bow-legged and he ran awkwardly.The black bag caught against the door and he stumbled and fell.“Crazy, that’s what he is—crazy!” he sputtered as he arose from the sidewalk and hurried away."
"埃尔默·考利在店里和父亲大眼瞪着小眼。使他爆发这场怒火的直接对象已经逃走了，这个年轻人变得有些尴尬。“嗯，我就是这个意思。我觉得我们这么古里古怪的时间够久了。”他说着，走到陈列柜边，把枪放回了原处。他坐在一个桶上，然后穿上那只一直拿在手里的鞋，并把鞋带系好。他期待父亲表示理解地说些什么，可埃比尼泽开口说的话却让儿子怒火重燃。那年轻人没有回嘴，而是跑出了商店。这位店主用又长又脏的手指抓了抓自己的灰胡子，用方才面对那个旅行推销员时露出的犹豫不定的眼神望着自己的儿子。“我会被上浆的。”他轻声说，“唉，唉，我会被洗了之后熨平，再上浆！”","In the store Elmer Cowley and his father stared at each other.Now that the immediate object of his wrath had fled, the younger man was embarrassed.“Well, I meant it.I think we’ve been queer long enough,” he declared, going to the showcase and replacing the revolver.Sitting on a barrel he pulled on and fastened the shoe he had been holding in his hand.He was waiting for some word of understanding from his father but when Ebenezer spoke his words only served to reawaken the wrath in the son and the young man ran out of the store without replying.Scratching his grey beard with his long dirty fingers, the merchant looked at his son with the same wavering uncertain stare with which he had confronted the traveling man.“I’ll be starched,” he said softly.“Well, well, I’ll be washed and ironed and starched!”"
"埃尔默·考利离开温斯堡镇，沿着一条和铁轨并行的乡村小路走着。他不知道去哪儿，也不知道自己要做什么。马路向右急转之后从铁轨下穿过，就在那里有个深沟。他在沟旁停下来，使他在店里突然爆发的那股激愤又开始冒了出来。“我不想做个怪人——被人盯着看，被人偷听。”他大声宣布，“我要和平常人一样。我要让乔治·威拉德看看。他会发现的。我要让他看看！”","Elmer Cowley went out of Winesburg and along a country road that paralleled the railroad track.He did not know where he was going or what he was going to do.In the shelter of a deep cut where the road, after turning sharply to the right, dipped under the tracks he stopped and the passion that had been the cause of his outburst in the store began to again find expression.“I will not be queer—one to be looked at and listened to,” he declared aloud. “I’ll be like other people.I’ll show that George Willard.He’ll find out.I’ll show him!”"
"心烦意乱的年轻人站在马路中央，回头怒视着那座小镇。他并不认识乔治·威拉德记者，对这个在镇上东奔西跑采集新闻的高个子男孩也没什么特别的感觉。记者在《温斯堡鹰报》办公室和印刷室的现身，不过是代表这位年轻商人心里的某种东西而已。他觉得这个多次经过考利父子商店，并在大街上停下同人们交谈的小伙子一定是在谈他，或许还在嘲笑他。他觉得乔治·威拉德属于这个小镇，是小镇的典型人物。在他身上代表了小镇的精神。埃尔默·考利不会相信乔治也有不快乐的时候，那些朦胧的渴求，以及隐秘又无可名状的欲望也曾造访过他的心灵。难道他不是代表着公众的看法吗？难道温斯堡众人的看法没有指责过考利一家太过古怪吗？难道他不曾边走边吹着口哨，笑声响遍大街？打击他不就是打击了更大的敌人——那微笑着我行我素的东西——温斯堡的裁判？","The distraught young man stood in the middle of the road and glared back at the town.He did not know the reporter George Willard and had no special feeling concerning the tall boy who ran about town gathering the town news.The reporter had merely come, by his presence in the office and in the printshop of the Winesburg Eagle, to stand for something in the young merchant’s mind.He thought the boy who passed and repassed Cowley & Son’s store and who stopped to talk to people in the street must be thinking of him and perhaps laughing at him.George Willard, he felt, belonged to the town, typified the town, represented in his person the spirit of the town.Elmer Cowley could not have believed that George Willard had also his days of unhappiness, that vague hungers and secret unnamable desires visited also his mind.Did he not represent public opinion and had not the public opinion of Winesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness?Did he not walk whistling and laughing through Main Street?Might not one by striking his person strike also the greater enemy—the thing that smiled and went its own way—the judgment of Winesburg?"
"埃尔默·考利格外高，双臂长而有力。他的头发、眉毛和下巴上开始长出来的细软的胡子都是灰白的，几乎是白色的。他的牙齿从双唇间凸出来；他的眼睛是蓝色的，就像温斯堡的男孩子们口袋里装着的那种叫“爱吉斯”的玩具子珠的暗蓝色。埃尔默在温斯堡住了一年，没有交到任何朋友。他觉得自己注定终生没有朋友，他恨这个想法。","Elmer Cowley was extraordinarily tall and his arms were long and powerful.His hair, his eyebrows, and the downy beard that had begun to grow upon his chin, were pale almost to whiteness.His teeth protruded from between his lips and his eyes were blue with the colorless blueness of the marbles called “aggies” that the boys of Winesburg carried in their pockets.Elmer had lived in Winesburg for a year and had made no friends.He was, he felt, one condemned to go through life without friends and he hated the thought."
"这个高个子的年轻人把手塞在裤子口袋里，闷闷不乐地沿着马路，拖着步子走。天气很冷，吹着凛冽的风，可这会儿太阳开始冒出来了，马路变得松软、泥泞。路上尽是冻泥形成的垄脊，顶上的部分开始融化了，泥巴都粘在埃尔默的鞋上。他的双脚开始变冷。走了几英里之后，他从马路上下来，穿过一片田野，进入了一个树林。他在林子里用木棍燃起火堆。他坐在火堆旁，试着让自己暖和一些；他的身上和心里都痛苦极了。","Sullenly the tall young man tramped along the road with his hands stuffed into his trouser pockets.The day was cold with a raw wind, but presently the sun began to shine and the road became soft and muddy.The tops of the ridges of frozen mud that formed the road began to melt and the mud clung to Elmer’s shoes.His feet became cold.When he had gone several miles he turned off the road, crossed a field and entered a wood.In the wood he gathered sticks to build a fire, by which he sat trying to warm himself, miserable in body and in mind."
"他在火堆边的木头上坐了两个小时，然后站起身，小心地爬过一大片低矮的灌木丛，来到一道篱笆前，越过田野望向被一片矮屋棚围住的一家小农舍。一个微笑浮现在他嘴角。他开始用长长的手臂朝着一个正在田里剥玉米的男人打起手势来。","For two hours he sat on the log by the fire and then, arising and creeping cautiously through a mass of underbrush, he went to a fence and looked across fields to a small farmhouse surrounded by low sheds.A smile came to his lips and he began making motions with his long arms to a man who was husking corn in one of the fields."
"在这个年轻商人痛苦的这段时间里，他回到了自己幼年时期生活过的那间农场。在那里有另一种人，他觉得能对他们解释自己。农场里的那个男人名叫穆克，是个弱智的老头。埃比尼泽·考利曾经雇佣过他。他一直呆在那里，直到农场被卖掉。那个老头住在农舍后面的一间未经粉刷的棚屋里，整日在田地里闲晃。","In his hour of misery the young merchant had returned to the farm where he had lived through boyhood and where there was another human being to whom he felt he could explain himself.The man on the farm was a half-witted old fellow named Mook.He had once been employed by Ebenezer Cowley and had stayed on the farm when it was sold.The old man lived in one of the unpainted sheds back of the farmhouse and puttered about all day in the fields."
"可是蠢笨的穆克活得很开心。他有种孩子般的信仰，相信和他一同住在棚屋里的动物的理解力。当他感到孤独时，就会和奶牛、猪，甚至是在谷场里到处跑的小鸡长时间地交谈。就是他把“被洗熨”之类的词变成了他前雇主的口头禅。遇到令人兴奋或是吃惊的事情，他就茫然地微笑，喃喃地说：“我要被洗了再熨平。唉，唉，我要被洗了之后熨平，再上浆。”","Mook the half-wit lived happily.With childlike faith he believed in the intelligence of the animals that lived in the sheds with him, and when he was lonely held long conversations with the cows, the pigs, and even with the chickens that ran about the barnyard.He it was who had put the expression regarding being “laundered” into the mouth of his former employer.When excited or surprised by anything he smiled vaguely and muttered: “I’ll be washed and ironed.Well, well, I’ll be washed and ironed and starched.”"
"这个蠢笨的老人丢下在剥的玉米，去树林里见埃尔默·考利。对年轻人的突然出现，老人既不感到惊讶，也没有表现得特别好奇。他也觉得脚冷，于是坐在火堆旁的那根木头上；他因为温暖而表示感激，却明显对埃尔默要说的话表现得漠不关心。","When the half-witted old man left his husking of corn and came into the wood to meet Elmer Cowley, he was neither surprised nor especially interested in the sudden appearance of the young man.His feet also were cold and he sat on the log by the fire, grateful for the warmth and apparently indifferent to what Elmer had to say."
"埃尔默热切又畅快地说着，一边走来走去，一边挥动着双臂。“你不知道我出了什么事，所以你当然不在意。”他说道，“可我就不一样了。你看，我总是摆脱不掉。爸爸古里古怪，妈妈也是这样。即使是妈妈以前穿的衣服也和别人不一样，看看爸爸穿到镇里去的那件外套吧，他还觉得挺体面呢。他为什么不买件新的？又花不了多少钱。我来告诉你原因。爸爸不知道，即使是妈妈还活着的时候，她也不知道。梅布尔不同。她知道，可她不会说什么。可是，我会。我不打算再让别人盯着我们看了。为什么，听我说，穆克，爸爸不知道他的店在镇上只不过是个古怪的杂物堆，他买的东西从来都卖不出去。他对此一无所知。有时候他因为没生意有些着急，就去买些别的东西。晚上的时候，他坐在楼上的火炉旁，说不久就会有生意了。他并不着急。他是个古怪的人。他甚至不太懂得去担心着急。”","Elmer talked earnestly and with great freedom, walking up and down and waving his arms about.“You don’t understand what’s the matter with me so of course you don’t care,” he declared.“With me it’s different.Look how it has always been with me.Father is queer and mother was queer, too.Even the clothes mother used to wear were not like other people’s clothes, and look at that coat in which father goes about there in town, thinking he’s dressed up, too.Why don’t he get a new one?It wouldn’t cost much.I’ll tell you why.Father doesn’t know and when mother was alive she didn’t know either.Mabel is different.She knows but she won’t say anything.I will, though.I’m not going to be stared at any longer.Why, look here, Mook, father doesn’t know that his store there in town is just a queer jumble, that he’ll never sell the stuff he buys.He knows nothing about it.Sometimes he’s a little worried that trade doesn’t come and then he goes and buys something else.In the evenings he sits by the fire upstairs and says trade will come after a while. He isn’t worried.He’s queer.He doesn’t know enough to be worried.”"
"激动的年轻人变得愈发激动起来。“他不知道，可我知道。”他喊着，不再低头盯着弱智老头的那张迟钝、木讷、毫无反应的脸。“我了解得一清二楚。我再也忍不下去了。我们住在这儿的时候是不一样的。我白天工作，晚上上床睡觉。我不像现在这样经常能见到人，还要思考。在镇上的晚上，我就去邮局或者到车站去看火车进站，没人同我说话。大家站在四周，大笑着，他们互相交谈，可不对我说话。我觉得太古怪了，结果我也不会说话了。我就离开。什么也不说。我说不出。”","The excited young man became more excited.“He don’t know, but I know,” he shouted, stopping to gaze down into the dumb, unresponsive face of the half-wit.“I know too well.I can’t stand it.When we lived out here it was different.I worked and at night I went to bed and slept.I wasn’t always seeing people and thinking as I am now.In the evening, there in town, I go to the post office or to the depot to see the train come in, and no one says anything to me.Everyone stands around and laughs and they talk but they say nothing to me.Then I feel so queer that I can’t talk either.I go away.I don’t say anything.I can’t.”"
"年轻人的怒火无法遏制。“我受不了了，”他高声喊道，抬头望着光秃秃的树杈，“我生来不是为了忍耐的。”","The fury of the young man became uncontrollable.“I won’t stand it,” he yelled, looking up at the bare branches of the trees.“I’m not made to stand it.”"
"埃尔默被坐在火堆边木头上那人的沉闷的脸给弄疯了。他转身瞪着他，就像他回身瞪着通往温斯堡的马路一样。“回去干活吧，”他尖声叫道，“我跟你说话有什么用处呢？”他突然想到了什么，声音低了下去。“我也是个懦夫，不是吗？”他喃喃自语道，“你知道我为什么一直徒步到这儿来？我非得和谁说说不可，你是唯一我能说话的人。我又找到了另一个怪家伙，你看。我逃走了，我就是这么干的。我受不了乔治·威拉德那样的人。我不得不来找你。我应该告诉他，我会这么干的。“","Maddened by the dull face of the man on the log by the fire, Elmer turned and glared at him as he had glared back along the road at the town of Winesburg.“Go on back to work,” he screamed.“What good does it do me to talk to you?”A thought came to him and his voice dropped.“I’m a coward too, eh?” he muttered.“Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?I had to tell someone and you were the only one I could tell.I hunted out another queer one, you see.I ran away, that’s what I did.I couldn’t stand up to someone like that George Willard.I had to come to you.I ought to tell him and I will.”"
"他又提高了嗓音，变成大喊大叫，挥舞着胳膊。“我要告诉他，我不会做个怪人。我不在乎他们怎么想。我再也受不了了。”","Again his voice arose to a shout and his arms flew about.“I will tell him.I won’t be queer.I don’t care what they think.I won’t stand it.”"
"埃尔默·考利跑出了树林，留下弱智的老头坐在火堆前的木头上。不久，老人站了起来，翻过篱笆，又回去剥玉米了。“我要被洗了之后熨平，再上浆。”他说着，“哎哟，哎哟，我要被洗了之后熨平，再上个浆。”穆克很感兴趣。他沿着小巷来到一片田边，两头奶牛正站在那里一点点地啃食着谷草堆。“埃尔默在那儿。”他对奶牛说，“埃尔默疯了。你们最好躲到草堆后面去，别叫他看见。他终究会伤害某个人的，埃尔默会的。”","Elmer Cowley ran out of the woods leaving the half-wit sitting on the log before the fire.Presently the old man arose and climbing over the fence went back to his work in the corn.“I’ll be washed and ironed and starched,” he declared.“Well, well, I’ll be washed and ironed.”Mook was interested.He went along a lane to a field where two cows stood nibbling at a straw stack.“Elmer was here,” he said to the cows.“Elmer is crazy.You better get behind the stack where he don’t see you.He’ll hurt someone yet, Elmer will.”"
"当天晚上八点的时候，乔治·威拉德坐在《鹰报》办公室里写东西，埃尔默·考利在前门探头进来。他把帽子拉低盖住了眼睛，脸上露出一种阴沉而坚定的神情。“你跟我出来一下。”他一边说着，一边走进去关上门。他的手一直放在门把上，好像在防止别人进来。“你就到外面来一下。我想见你。”","At eight o’clock that evening Elmer Cowley put his head in at the front door of the office of the Winesburg Eagle where George Willard sat writing.His cap was pulled down over his eyes and a sullen determined look was on his face.“You come on outside with me,” he said, stepping in and closing the door.He kept his hand on the knob as though prepared to resist anyone else coming in.“You just come along outside.I want to see you.”"
"乔治·威拉德和埃尔默·考利在温斯堡的大街上散步。夜里很冷，乔治·威拉德穿了件新大衣，看上去衣冠楚楚的，非常帅气。他的双手插在大衣口袋里，探询地望着他的同伴。他老早就在想和这个年轻商人结交，想弄明白他在想些什么。现在他认为机会来了，所以感到很高兴。“我真想知道他有什么事？或许他觉得他有条可以上报纸的新闻。不会是场火灾，因为我没听到过火警，也没有人跑动。”他想着。","George Willard and Elmer Cowley walked through the main street of Winesburg.The night was cold and George Willard had on a new overcoat and looked very spruce and dressed up.He thrust his hands into the overcoat pockets and looked inquiringly at his companion.He had long been wanting to make friends with the young merchant and find out what was in his mind.Now he thought he saw a chance and was delighted.“I wonder what he’s up to?Perhaps he thinks he has a piece of news for the paper.It can’t be a fire because I haven’t heard the fire bell and there isn’t anyone running,” he thought."
"寒冷的十一月的傍晚，温斯堡的大街上只有少数几个人，他们都在匆忙赶路，一心想到某个商店后门的火炉边取个暖。很多商店的窗户上都结了霜，寒风吹得挂在韦林医生诊所楼梯入口的锡制标牌哐啷作响。在赫恩的水果店前，一筐苹果和一个装满新扫帚的架子立在人行道上。埃尔默·考利停下来，面朝乔治·威拉德站着。他试图说话，胳膊开始上下挥动。他的脸痉挛地抽搐着。他看起来要大声喊了。“噢，你回去吧。”他喊道，“别和我一起站在这儿。我没什么可告诉你的，我根本不想见到你。”","In the main street of Winesburg, on the cold November evening, but few citizens appeared and these hurried along bent on getting to the stove at the back of some store.The windows of the stores were frosted and the wind rattled the tin sign that hung over the entrance to the stairway leading to Doctor Welling’s office.Before Hern’s Grocery a basket of apples and a rack filled with new brooms stood on the sidewalk.Elmer Cowley stopped and stood facing George Willard.He tried to talk and his arms began to pump up and down.His face worked spasmodically.He seemed about to shout.“Oh, you go on back,” he cried.“Don’t stay out here with me.I ain’t got anything to tell you. I don’t want to see you at all.”"
"心烦意乱的年轻商人在温斯堡这片居民区的街道上来回晃荡了三个钟头。因为没能宣布自己不愿再做怪人的决心，他气得两眼发黑。涌上心头挫败的感觉太苦涩了，他想要流泪。整个下午他数个小时的气急败坏却毫无意义，连同他在年轻记者面前的失败，使他觉得再也看不到自己的未来了。","For three hours the distracted young merchant wandered through the resident streets of Winesburg blind with anger, brought on by his failure to declare his determination not to be queer.Bitterly the sense of defeat settled upon him and he wanted to weep.After the hours of futile sputtering at nothingness that had occupied the afternoon and his failure in the presence of the young reporter, he thought he could see no hope of a future for himself."
"之后，他有了一个新的想法。他开始在周遭的黑暗中看到了一丝光亮。他来到已经黑灯打烊的考利父子商店。这商店已经在那儿空等了一年多，却没有生意上门。他偷偷爬进去，摸索着店后面炉边立着的一个圆桶。圆桶里面装的刨花下面放着一个锡制的盒子，里面装着考利父子商店的现金。每晚，埃比尼泽·考利关上店门，把盒子放进桶里，然后上楼睡觉。“他们永远都想不到这样一个不起眼的地方。”他自言自语，心里想着盗贼。","And then a new idea dawned for him.In the darkness that surrounded him he began to see a light.Going to the now darkened store, where Cowley & Son had for over a year waited vainly for trade to come, he crept stealthily in and felt about in a barrel that stood by the stove at the rear.In the barrel beneath shavings lay a tin box containing Cowley & Son’s cash.Every evening Ebenezer Cowley put the box in the barrel when he closed the store and went upstairs to bed.“They wouldn’t never think of a careless place like that,” he told himself, thinking of robbers."
"卖掉农场剩余的现金卷成了一小卷，大概四百美金。埃尔默从里面拿出两张十元的钞票，共二十美元。然后他将盒子重又放回刨花下面，静静地走出前门，重新回到街上。","Elmer took twenty dollars, two ten-dollar bills, from the little roll containing perhaps four hundred dollars, the cash left from the sale of the farm.Then replacing the box beneath the shavings he went quietly out at the front door and walked again in the streets."
"他想到的结束不幸的方法非常简单。“我要离开这儿，离开家。”他告诉自己。他知道有一趟货运慢车会在午夜经过温斯堡，然后开往克利夫兰，并在黎明到达那里。他可以偷偷搭乘这趟区间车，等他到达克利夫兰就会消失在人群中。他可以在某个店里打工，同其他的工人们交朋友，然后变得和其他人没什么差异了。那时，他就可以交谈和大笑。他不会再那么古怪，会交上朋友。生活于他就会开始变得温暖而富有意义，就像对其他人一样。","The idea that he thought might put an end to all of his unhappiness was very simple.“I will get out of here, run away from home,” he told himself.He knew that a local freight train passed through Winesburg at midnight and went on to Cleveland, where it arrived at dawn.He would steal a ride on the local and when he got to Cleveland would lose himself in the crowds there.He would get work in some shop and become friends with the other workmen and would be indistinguishable.Then he could talk and laugh.He would no longer be queer and would make friends.Life would begin to have warmth and meaning for him as it had for others."
"这个笨拙的高个年轻人大步穿过街道，嘲笑自己曾那么生气，还有些害怕乔治·威拉德。他决定在离开小镇前应当同那位年轻记者谈谈，告诉他这一切，也许会向他挑战，并由此向全温斯堡的人挑战。","The tall awkward young man, striding through the streets, laughed at himself because he had been angry and had been half afraid of George Willard.He decided he would have his talk with the young reporter before he left town, that he would tell him about things, perhaps challenge him, challenge all of Winesburg through him."
"埃尔默重又充满了自信，容光焕发。他来到新威拉德旅社的办公室，砰砰地敲着门。一个睡眼惺忪的男孩睡在办公室里的一张简易床上。他不拿薪水，只是吃住在旅社，并自豪地顶着“夜班员工”的头衔。埃尔默在这个男孩子面前是大胆而坚定的。“你‘叫他起来”，他命令道，“你告诉他到火车站来。我要见见他，我要搭区间车走了。告诉他穿上衣服下来。我没多少时间了。”","Aglow with new confidence Elmer went to the office of the New Willard House and pounded on the door.A sleep-eyed boy slept on a cot in the office.He received no salary but was fed at the hotel table and bore with pride the title of “night clerk.”Before the boy Elmer was bold, insistent.“You wake him up,” he commanded.“You tell him to come down by the depot.I got to see him and I’m going away on the local.Tell him to dress and come on down.I ain’t got much time.”"
"午夜的区间车结束了在温斯堡的工作，铁路工人正在挂车厢，摇灯，准备继续往东行驶。乔治·威拉德揉着眼睛，重新穿上了那件新大衣，满心好奇地一路跑到月台上来。“好了，我来了。你想干嘛？你有话要对我说，不是吗？”他说。","The midnight local had finished its work in Winesburg and the trainsmen were coupling cars, swinging lanterns and preparing to resume their flight east.George Willard, rubbing his eyes and again wearing the new overcoat, ran down to the station platform afire with curiosity.“Well, here I am.What do you want?You’ve got something to tell me, eh?” he said."
"埃尔默试图解释。他舔了舔嘴唇，望着开始鸣笛并开动的火车。“嗯，你看，”他开口说，接着，舌头就不听使唤了。“我要被洗了之后熨平。我会被洗了之后熨平，再上浆。”他不太连贯地低声说道。","Elmer tried to explain.He wet his lips with his tongue and looked at the train that had begun to groan and get under way.“Well, you see,” he began, and then lost control of his tongue.“I’ll be washed and ironed.I’ll be washed and ironed and starched,” he muttered half incoherently."
"在月台的阴影里，埃尔默·考利站在鸣笛的火车旁，怒火中烧地跳起来。灯光斜射进空气中，在他眼前上下跳动。他从口袋里拿出那两张十元钞票，把他们塞进乔治·威拉德的手里。“拿着。”他喊道，“我不想要了。把钱给我父亲。这是我偷来的。”他愤怒地吼叫了一声，然后转过身，长长的双臂开始在空中乱抓。仿佛是要从禁锢他的一双手中挣脱出来一样，他大打出手，一拳一拳地打在乔治·威拉德的胸膛、脖颈和嘴上。年轻记者被这拳头凶猛的力量打晕了，他在月台上翻滚了几下，陷入半昏迷状态。埃尔默跳上了开动的火车，他跑过几节车厢的车顶，跳到了一节平整的车厢上，趴在那里往回望，竭力想看到倒在黑暗中的那个人。他的自豪感油然而生。“我让他看见了。”他叫道，“我想我让他看见了。我没那么古怪。我想我让他看见了，我并没那么古怪。”","Elmer Cowley danced with fury beside the groaning train in the darkness on the station platform.Lights leaped into the air and bobbed up and down before his eyes.Taking the two ten-dollar bills from his pocket he thrust them into George Willard’s hand.“Take them,” he cried.“I don’t want them.Give them to father.I stole them.”With a snarl of rage he turned and his long arms began to flay the air.Like one struggling for release from hands that held him he struck out, hitting George Willard blow after blow on the breast, the neck, the mouth.The young reporter rolled over on the platform half unconscious, stunned by the terrific force of the blows.Springing aboard the passing train and running over the tops of cars, Elmer sprang down to a flat car and lying on his face looked back, trying to see the fallen man in the darkness.Pride surged up in him.“I showed him,” he cried.“I guess I showed him.I ain’t so queer.I guess I showed him I ain’t so queer.”"
"第十七章 未讲出口的谎言","Chapter 17 The Untold Lie"
"雷·皮尔逊和哈尔·温特斯是温斯堡以北三英里处一家农场雇佣的帮工。每周六下午，他们来到镇上，同其他的乡下伙计一起在街上闲逛。","Ray Pearson and Hal Winters were farm hands employed on a farm three miles north of Winesburg.On Saturday afternoons they came into town and wandered about through the streets with other fellows from the country."
"雷是个五十岁左右的男人。他性格安静，相当神经质，留着棕色的胡子。因为干了太多的重活，他的肩膀是圆圆的。他同哈尔·温特斯的性格差异要多大有多大。","Ray was a quiet, rather nervous man of perhaps fifty with a brown beard and shoulders rounded by too much and too hard labor.In his nature he was as unlike Hal Winters as two men can be unlike."
"雷是个不折不扣的不苟言笑之人。他的妻子身材小巧，五官分明，声音也十分尖细。他们俩带着六个细胳膊细腿的孩子，住在一个摇摇欲坠、破烂不堪的木板房子里。房子位于雷被雇佣的农场后面的一条小河边上。","Ray was an altogether serious man and had a little sharp-featured wife who had also a sharp voice.The two, with half a dozen thin-legged children, lived in a tumble-down frame house beside a creek at the back end of the Wills farm where Ray was employed."
"他的工友哈尔·温特斯是个年轻小伙子。他不是内德·温特斯家族的成员，那个家族在温斯堡非常受人尊敬。但他却是那位叫温德彼得·温特斯的老人的三个儿子中的一个。这位老人在六英里外的尤宁维尔有一家锯木厂，全温斯堡的人都认为他是一个地地道道的老败家子。","Hal Winters, his fellow employee, was a young fellow.He was not of the Ned Winters family, who were very respectable people in Winesburg, but was one of the three sons of the old man called Windpeter Winters who had a sawmill near Unionville, six miles away, and who was looked upon by everyone in Winesburg as a confirmed old reprobate."
"来自温斯堡所在的俄亥俄北部地区的人都记得老温德彼得，因为他死得十分意外而且悲惨。一天晚上，他在镇上喝醉了，然后驾着马车沿着铁轨回尤宁维尔的家。住在那条路旁的屠夫亨利·布莱顿伯格在小镇边拦住了他，告诉他这样一定会撞上下行的火车，可温德彼得给了他一鞭子，然后继续赶路。他和两匹马被火车撞死的时候，一对驾马车回家的农民夫妇正好从附近的路上经过，目睹了这场事故。他们说，老温德彼得站在马车的座位上，朝着迎面而来的火车头胡言乱语、大声叫骂。当那两匹马在他不断的抽打下发疯般地朝着必死无疑的结局笔直冲过去的时候，他还高兴地大声尖叫。像乔治·威拉德和塞思·里士满这样的男孩子都真真切切地记得那次事故，因为，尽管镇上的每个人都觉得那个老头该下地狱，大家也会因为他的死过得更好，但他们却私下深信不疑老温德彼得其实知道自己是在干什么，因此钦佩他愚蠢的勇气。大多数的男孩子都会有那么一段时期，希望自己能光荣地死去，而不是做个杂货店的店员，过着平凡无奇的生活。","People from the part of Northern Ohio in which Winesburg lies will remember old Windpeter by his unusual and tragic death.He got drunk one evening in town and started to drive home to Unionville along the railroad tracks.Henry Brattenburg, the butcher, who lived out that way, stopped him at the edge of the town and told him he was sure to meet the down train but Windpeter slashed at him with his whip and drove on.When the train struck and killed him and his two horses a farmer and his wife who were driving home along a nearby road saw the accident.They said that old Windpeter stood up on the seat of his wagon, raving and swearing at the onrushing locomotive, and that he fairly screamed with delight when the team, maddened by his incessant slashing at them, rushed straight ahead to certain death.Boys like young George Willard and Seth Richmond will remember the incident quite vividly because, although everyone in our town said that the old man would go straight to hell and that the community was better off without him, they had a secret conviction that he knew what he was doing and admired his foolish courage.Most boys have seasons of wishing they could die gloriously instead of just being grocery clerks and going on with their humdrum lives."
"但这不是关于温德彼得·温特斯的故事，也不是那个在威尔斯农场同雷·皮尔逊一同干活的他的儿子哈尔的故事。这个故事是关于雷的。可是，难免还是要稍微地谈及一下年轻的哈尔，这样你才能明白其中的真意。","But this is not the story of Windpeter Winters nor yet of his son Hal who worked on the Wills farm with Ray Pearson.It is Ray’s story.It will, however, be necessary to talk a little of young Hal so that you will get into the spirit of it."
"哈尔是个坏小子。人人都这么说。温特斯家有三个儿子：约翰、哈尔和爱德华。他们都像父亲老温德彼得一样有着宽阔的肩膀和高大的身材，也都爱打架，玩女人，总而言之是无恶不作。","Hal was a bad one.Everyone said that.There were three of the Winters boys in that family, John, Hal, and Edward, all broad-shouldered big fellow like old Windpeter himself and all fighters and woman-chasers and generally all-around bad ones."
"其中哈尔最恶劣，常常到了邪门的地步。有一次他从父亲的锯木厂里偷了一堆木板，到温斯堡卖掉了。他用得来的钱给自己买了一套廉价又花哨的衣服。然后他就喝得酩酊大醉。他的父亲咒骂着到镇上来找他，两人一见面就在大街上大打出手，一起被抓起来关进了监狱。","Hal was the worst of the lot and always up to some devilment.He once stole a load of boards from his father’s mill and sold them in Winesburg.With the money he bought himself a suit of cheap, flashy clothes.Then he got drunk and when his father came raving into town to find him, they met and fought with their fists on Main Street and were arrested and put into jail together."
"哈尔来到威尔斯农场工作，因为他迷上了附近的一个乡村女教师。他那时才二十二岁，可他已经去过两三个温斯堡人说的“妓院”了。听说他迷恋了那位女教师，每个人都断定这事不会有好结果。“他只会给她带来麻烦，你们就等着瞧吧。”这就是人们相互传的话。","Hal went to work on the Wills farm because there was a country school teacher out that way who had taken his fancy.He was only twenty-two then but had already been in two or three of what were spoken of in Winesburg as “women scrapes.”Everyone who heard of his infatuation for the school teacher was sure it would turn out badly.“He’ll only get her into trouble, you’ll see,” was the word that went around."
"十月下旬的一天，雷和哈尔两人在地里干活。他们剥着玉米，时不时地说点什么，一起哈哈大笑。然后他们都陷入了沉默。相比之下，雷更敏感，对事情总要更在意一些，他的两只手皴裂了，疼得厉害。他把手放进外衣口袋，眺望远处的田野。他带着悲伤又心烦的情绪，却被这乡间的美景感染了。如果你了解温斯堡乡间的秋天，知道那些低矮的山坡是如何被染成各种黄色和红色，你就会明白他的感受。他开始想起很久以前的时光，那时他还是个小伙子，同当时在温斯堡做面包师的父亲住在一起。在那些日子里，他就会来到树林里漫步，捡果子，打野兔，或者只是叼着烟斗四处闲逛。他的婚姻就是在他闲逛的日子里产生的。他引诱了一个在他父亲店里等着买东西的女孩子和他一同外出，接着就出了事。他想起了那个下午，以及它如何影响了他的一生，心里便油然生出一种不平的情绪。他忘了哈尔在旁边，开始喃喃自语了起来。“被上帝骗了，我就是这样，被生活骗了、耍了。”他低声说。","And so these two men, Ray and Hal, were at work in a field on a day in the late October.They were husking corn and occasionally something was said and they laughed.Then came silence.Ray, who was the more sensitive and always minded things more, had chapped hands and they hurt.He put them into his coat pockets and looked away across the fields.He was in a sad, distracted mood and was affected by the beauty of the country.If you knew the Winesburg country in the fall and how the low hills are all splashed with yellows and reds you would understand his feeling.He began to think of the time, long ago when he was a young fellow living with his father, then a baker in Winesburg, and how on such days he had wandered away into the woods to gather nuts, hunt rabbits, or just to loaf about and smoke his pipe.His marriage had come about through one of his days of wandering.He had induced a girl who waited on trade in his father’s shop to go with him and something had happened.He was thinking of that afternoon and how it had affected his whole life when a spirit of protest awoke in him.He had forgotten about Hal and muttered words.“Tricked by Gad, that’s what I was, tricked by life and made a fool of,” he said in a low voice."
"仿佛明白他的想法似的，哈尔·温特斯大声地问道：“那么，值得吗？怎么样呢，嗯？婚姻以及所有的这一切如何呢？”他问，然后大笑起来。哈尔试图一直笑下去，可他的情绪也是诚挚的。他开始诚恳地说话。“是个人都得这么过吗？”他问，“一个人终生非得像匹马似的被套牢、被驱赶吗？”","As though understanding his thoughts, Hal Winters spoke up.“Well, has it been worth while?What about it, eh?What about marriage and all that?” he asked and then laughed.Hal tried to keep on laughing but he too was in an earnest mood.He began to talk earnestly.“Has a fellow got to do it?” he asked.“Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?”"
"哈尔并没有等他回答，而是跳起来，在玉米堆之间来回走动。他变得越来越激动。他突然弯下身，捡起一穗黄玉米，扔到篱笆上。“我让内尔·冈瑟有麻烦了。”他说，“我跟你说，可你别说出去。”","Hal didn’t wait for an answer but sprang to his feet and began to walk back and forth between the corn shocks.He was getting more and more excited.Bending down suddenly he picked up an ear of the yellow corn and threw it at the fence.“I’ve got Nell Gunther in trouble,” he said.“I’m telling you, but you keep your mouth shut.”"
"雷·皮尔逊立起身，站在那里望着。他几乎比哈尔矮一英尺，等年轻者走过来把双手放在年长者肩膀上的时候，他们构成了一幅画。他们站在辽阔又空荡荡的田野里，玉米一排排安静地堆在身后，远处是黄红相间的连绵山坡，他们从两个漠不关心的工友变成了令彼此生气勃勃的人。哈尔感觉到了，因为那是他的方式，他大笑起来，“咳，老伙计，”他有些局促地说，“来吧，给我点儿建议。我让内尔有麻烦了。或许你也曾经陷入这样的困境。我知道大家说的是应该做的事，可你怎么看呢？我该结婚，然后安定下来吗？我是不是该套上马具，像匹老马似的疲于奔命呢？你了解我，雷。除了我自己，没人能打倒我。我是该这么做呢，还是该让内尔滚开？来吧，你来告诉我。无论你怎么说，雷，我都听你的。”","Ray Pearson arose and stood staring.He was almost a foot shorter than Hal, and when the younger man came and put his two hands on the older man’s shoulders they made a picture.There they stood in the big empty field with the quiet corn shocks standing in rows behind them and the red and yellow hills in the distance, and from being just two indifferent workmen they had become all alive to each other.Hal sensed it and because that was his way he laughed. “Well, old daddy,” he said awkwardly, “come on, advise me.I’ve got Nell in trouble.Perhaps you’ve been in the same fix yourself.I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?Shall I marry and settle down?Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?You know me, Ray.There can’t anyone break me but I can break myself.Shall I do it or shall I tell Nell to go to the devil?Come on, you tell me.Whatever you say, Ray, I’ll do.”"
"雷没有回答。他把哈尔的手抖落，转过身，笔直地朝谷仓走去。他是个敏感的人，眼泪在他眼里打转。他知道他只能对老温德彼得·温特斯的儿子哈尔·温特斯说一件事，这件事是他的教养和所有他认识的人的信条所赞同的。可无论如何，他都说不出口他明知道该说的话。","Ray couldn’t answer.He shook Hal’s hands loose and turning walked straight away toward the barn. He was a sensitive man and there were tears in his eyes.He knew there was only one thing to say to Hal Winters, son of old Windpeter Winters, only one thing that all his own training and all the beliefs of the people he knew would approve, but for his life he couldn’t say what he knew he should say."
"下午四点半的时候，雷的妻子沿着河边的小路走过来叫他，那时他正在谷场那里闲逛。同哈尔谈过话后，他没有再回到玉米地里去，而是在谷仓旁干活。他已经做完了晚上的杂事，看见哈尔穿戴整齐，从农舍出来走上了马路，准备到镇上去找乐子。他拖着步子跟在妻子的身后，边眼睛望着地思索着，边沿着小路往家里走去。他弄不懂是哪里出了错。每当他抬眼看到薄暮中的乡间美景，他都想要做点儿从没做过的事，比如大喊、尖叫，用拳头揍妻子一顿，或者其他什么想象不到的可怕的事。他沿着小路走着，抓耳挠腮地想要弄明白。他使劲地看着妻子的后背，可她似乎一切如常。","At half past four that afternoon Ray was puttering about the barnyard when his wife came up the lane along the creek and called him.After the talk with Hal he hadn’t returned to the cornfield but worked about the barn.He had already done the evening chores and had seen Hal, dressed and ready for a roistering night in town, come out of the farmhouse and go into the road.Along the path to his own house he trudged behind his wife, looking at the ground and thinking.He couldn’t make out what was wrong.Every time he raised his eyes and saw the beauty of the country in the failing light he wanted to do something he had never done before, shout or scream or hit his wife with his fists or something equally unexpected and terrifying.Along the path he went scratching his head and trying to make it out.He looked hard at his wife’s back but she seemed all right."
"她只想让他到镇上去买些食物，可她刚一对他说到想要买的东西，就开始责骂他。“你总在闲逛。”她说，“现在我想让你忙起来。家里没有晚饭了，你得赶快到镇上去买回来。”","She only wanted him to go into town for groceries and as soon as she had told him what she wanted began to scold.“You’re always puttering,” she said.“Now I want you to hustle.There isn’t anything in the house for supper and you’ve got to get to town and back in a hurry.”"
"雷进了自己的家，从门后的衣钩上拿了件外套。衣服口袋都已经磨破了，衣领也磨得发亮。他的妻子进了卧室，很快就出来，一只手上拿着一块脏兮兮的抹布，另一只手里拿着三块银元。孩子在房子里的什么地方大声哭起来，炉边睡觉的狗起来打了个哈欠。妻子又开始骂他。“孩子们总是不停地哭。你干嘛总是在闲逛？”她问道。","Ray went into his own house and took an overcoat from a hook back of the door.It was torn about the pockets and the collar was shiny.His wife went into the bedroom and presently came out with a soiled cloth in one hand and three silver dollars in the other.Somewhere in the house a child wept bitterly and a dog that had been sleeping by the stove arose and yawned. Again the wife scolded.“The children will cry and cry.Why are you always puttering?” she asked."
"雷走出房子，翻过篱笆进了一片田地。天渐渐黑下来，眼前的景色美极了。所有低矮的山坡都被涂上了色彩，即使是篱笆角落里的小灌木丛也美得生机盎然。在雷·皮尔逊看来，整个世界变得栩栩如生，就如同他和哈尔站在玉米地里四目相对时，突然变得生气勃勃了一样。","Ray went out of the house and climbed the fence into a field.It was just growing dark and the scene that lay before him was lovely.All the low hills were washed with color and even the little clusters of bushes in the corners of the fences were alive with beauty.The whole world seemed to Ray Pearson to have become alive with something just as he and Hal had suddenly become alive when they stood in the corn field stating into each other’s eyes."
"在那个秋日的傍晚，温斯堡的乡间美景让雷感到无力承受。仅此而已。他却无法承受。突然间，他完全忘掉了要做一名安静的农场老帮工。他脱掉那件磨破的外套，开始在田野里狂奔。他边跑边大声地喊出对自己生活的抗议，对所有生活的抗议，对使生活变得丑陋的所有东西的抗议。“没有承诺。”他朝四周的旷野大喊道，“我没有向我的明妮做过任何承诺，哈尔也没有对内尔许诺过什么。我知道他没有。她跟着他到树林里，是因为她想去。他想要的和她一样。为什么我得付出代价？为什么哈尔得付出代价？为什么要有人付出代价？我不想哈尔变得又老又憔悴。我要告诉他。我不能让这事继续下去。我要在哈尔到镇上前拦住他，我要告诉他。”","The beauty of the country about Winesburg was too much for Ray on that fall evening.That is all there was to it.He could not stand it.Of a sudden he forgot all about being a quiet old farm hand and throwing off the torn overcoat began to run across the field.As he ran he shouted a protest against his life, against all life, against everything that makes life ugly.“There was no promise made,” he cried into the empty spaces that lay about him.“I didn’t promise my Minnie anything and Hal hasn’t made any promise to Nell.I know he hasn’t.She went into the woods with him because she wanted to go.What he wanted she wanted.Why should I pay?Why should Hal pay?Why should anyone pay?I don’t want Hal to become old and worn out.I’ll tell him.I won’t let it go on.I’ll catch Hal before he gets to town and I’ll tell him.”"
"雷笨拙地跑着，脚下一拌还摔倒了一次。“我必须拦住哈尔，告诉他。”他不停地想，尽管他喘个不停，可还是越来越使劲地跑着。他跑的时候想到了一些多年来从未想过的事情——他结婚的时候是如何计划到西部去找在俄勒冈州波特兰市的叔叔——他是多么不想做个农场帮工，想到如果到了西部他就会到海上做水手或者在大牧场找份工作，骑马到西部小镇去，大叫大笑地吵醒家家户户。接着，他跑的时候想到了孩子们，觉得他们的手紧紧地抓着他。所有他想到自己的这些事情他都套在了哈尔身上，他觉得这些孩子们的手也紧紧地抓着那个年轻人。“他们是生活的意外，哈尔。”他喊道，“他们不是我的，也不是你的。我和他们一点儿关系都没有。","Ray ran clumsily and once he stumbled and fell down.“I must catch Hal and tell him,” he kept thinking, and although his breath came in gasps he kept running harder and harder.As he ran he thought of things that hadn’t come into his mind for years—how at the time he married he had planned to go west to his uncle in Portland, Oregon—how he hadn’t wanted to be a farm hand, but had thought when he got out West he would go to sea and be a sailor or get a job on a ranch and ride a horse into Western towns, shouting and laughing and waking the people in the houses with his wild cries.Then as he ran he remembered his children and in fancy felt their hands clutching at him.All of his thoughts of himself were involved with the thoughts of Hal and he thought the children were clutching at the younger man also.“They are the accidents of life, Hal,” he cried.“They are not mine or yours.I had nothing to do with them.”"
"雷·皮尔逊不停地跑着，田野里开始黑了下来。他的呼吸声变成了小声的哭泣。当他到达马路边的篱笆时碰到了哈尔·温特斯，后者衣冠楚楚，洋洋得意地叼着烟斗散步。他却无法说出他的想法还有渴望。","Darkness began to spread over the fields as Ray Pearson ran on and on.His breath came in little sobs.When he came to the fence at the edge of the road and confronted Hal Winters, all dressed up and smoking a pipe as he walked jauntily along, he could not have told what he thought or what he wanted."
"雷·皮尔逊失去了勇气，这个故事发生在他身上的部分真正结束了。他来到篱笆边的时候，天已经快黑透了。他把手放在木桩的上面，站在那里望着。哈尔·温特斯跳过一条沟，来到雷面前，将双手放进口袋里笑起来。他似乎忘记了在玉米地里发生过的事了，他举起一只有力的手抓住雷的外套翻领，摇晃着这个老人，就跟他摇晃一只不听话的狗一样。","Ray Pearson lost his nerve and this is really the end of the story of what happened to him.It was almost dark when he got to the fence and he put his hands on the top bar and stood staring.Hal Winters jumped a ditch and coming up close to Ray put his hands into his pockets and laughed.He seemed to have lost his own sense of what had happened in the corn field and when he put up a strong hand and took hold of the lapel of Ray’s coat he shook the old man as he might have shaken a dog that had misbehaved."
"“你来告诉我，是吗？”他说，“好吧，别再费心告诉我什么了。我不是个懦夫，我已经打定了主意。”他又大笑起来，转回去跳过那道沟。“内尔不傻。”他说，“她没有要我娶她。是我想娶她。我想安定下来，生儿育女。”","“You came to tell me, eh?” he said.“Well, never mind telling me anything.I’m not a coward and I’ve already made up my mind.”He laughed again and jumped back across the ditch.“Nell ain’t no fool,” he said.“She didn’t ask me to marry her.I want to marry her.I want to settle down and have kids.”"
"雷·皮尔逊也大笑起来。他感到像是在嘲笑自己和全世界。","Ray Pearson also laughed.He felt like laughing at himself and all the world."
"当哈尔·温特斯的身影消失在通向温斯堡的马路尽头的暮霭中，他转身慢慢地穿过田野，来到那件旧外套被扔下的地方。他走路的时候，必定想起了和他细胳膊细腿的孩子们在河边那座摇摇欲坠、破烂不堪的房子里一起渡过的愉快夜晚，因为他在喃喃自语：“这也不错。我无论告诉他什么都有可能是个谎言。”他轻声说道。然后，他的身影也消失在了田间的黑暗之中。","As the form of Hal Winters disappeared in the dusk that lay over the road that led to Winesburg, he turned and walked slowly back across the fields to where he had left his torn overcoat.As he went some memory of pleasant evenings spent with the thin-legged children in the tumble-down house by the creek must have come into his mind, for he muttered words.“It’s just as well.Whatever I told him would have been a lie,” he said softly, and then his form also disappeared into the darkness of the fields."
"第十八章 一醉","Chapter 18 DRINK"
"汤姆·福斯特从辛辛那提来温斯堡的时候还年幼，能够留下很多新鲜的印象。他的外祖母是在小镇旁的一座农场里长大的，她小女孩的时候在镇上读过书。那时温斯堡还是个有十二或十五座房子的小村落，聚集在特鲁连山上的一家杂货店的周围。","Tom Foster came to Winesburg from Cincinnati when he was still young and could get many new impressions.His grandmother had been raised on a farm near the town and as a young girl had gone to school there when Winesburg was a village of twelve or fifteen houses clustered about a general store on the Trunion Pike."
"从她离开这个边远的定居地开始，这位老太太过的是一种什么样的生活啊！她又是个多么坚强、能干的小老太太啊！她的丈夫生前是个机械师。在他过世前，他们曾一起四处旅行，去过堪萨斯州、加拿大和纽约市。后来，她跟她的女儿住在一起。她女儿也嫁给了一个机械师，住在肯塔基州的卡温顿市，和辛辛那提隔江相望。","What a life the old woman had led since she went away from the frontier settlement and what a strong, capable little old thing she was!She had been in Kansas, in Canada, and in New York City, traveling about with her husband, a mechanic, before he died.Later she went to stay with her daughter, who had also married a mechanic and lived in Covington, Kentucky, across the river from Cincinnati."
"后来，汤姆·福斯特的外祖母的艰难岁月便开始了。起初，她的女婿在一次罢工中被警察打死了，接着，汤姆的母亲一病不起也去世了。外祖母的一点积蓄，也由于女儿的病和两场葬礼花光了。她差不多变成了一满脸倦容的老年女工，和外孙一起住在辛辛那提一条小巷里的旧货商店楼上。她在一间办公楼里打扫地板了五年，然后到一家餐馆做洗碗工。她的双手都已经扭曲变形了。她握着拖把或是扫帚的时候，那双手看着就像一根紧贴在树上蔓延着的老藤蔓的枯茎。","Then began the hard years for Tom Foster’s grandmother.First her son-in-law was killed by a policeman during a strike and then Tom’s mother became an invalid and died also.The grandmother had saved a little money, but it was swept away by the illness of the daughter and by the cost of the two funerals.She became a half worn-out old woman worker and lived with the grandson above a junk shop on a side street in Cincinnati.For five years she scrubbed the floors in an office building and then got a place as dish washer in a restaurant. Her hands were all twisted out of shape.When she took hold of a mop or a broom handle the hands looked like the dried stems of an old creeping vine clinging to a tree."
"老太太一找到机会就回到了温斯堡。一天晚上，她下班回家的时候捡到了一个钱包，里面装有三十七美元，于是机会来了。这次旅行对孩子而言是个天大的历险。当外祖母用枯老的双手紧紧地抓着那个钱包回到家的时候已经是晚上七点多了，她兴奋得几乎说不出话来。她坚持在当晚离开辛辛那提，她说要是留到第二天早上，失主肯定会把他们揪出来找麻烦的。那时汤姆十六岁，不得不背着用一条破毯子包起来的所有家当，吃力地跟着这位老妇来到车站。走在身旁的外祖母不停地催促他往前走。她掉了牙齿的干瘪的嘴紧张地抽搐着。当汤姆感到疲惫，想要把包袱放下来在十字路口休息的时候，她一把抓起包袱，如果他不阻拦，她就会把它扔到自己的背上去。等他们上了火车，火车驶离那座城市时，她高兴得就像个小姑娘，说话的样子就像是这个少年从来没有听过她说话一样。","The old woman came back to Winesburg as soon as she got the chance.One evening as she was coming home from work she found a pocketbook containing thirty-seven dollars, and that opened the way.The trip was a great adventure for the boy.It was past seven o’clock at night when the grandmother came home with the pocketbook held tightly in her old hands and she was so excited she could scarcely speak.She insisted on leaving Cincinnati that night, saying that if they stayed until morning the owner of the money would be sure to find them out and make trouble.Tom, who was then sixteen years old, had to go trudging off to the station with the old woman, bearing all of their earthly belongings done up in a worn-out blanket and slung across his back.By his side walked the grandmother urging him forward.Her toothless old mouth twitched nervously, and when Tom grew weary and wanted to put the pack down at a street crossing, she snatched it up and if he had not prevented would have slung it across her own back.When they got into the train and it had run out of the city she was as delighted as a girl and talked as the boy had never heard her talk before."
"随着火车哐当前行，外祖母整夜都在给汤姆讲有关温斯堡的故事，讲到了他将如何愉快地享受在田里干活和在林间打猎的生活。她无法相信，在她离开的时光里，五十年前的小村落竟然变成了一座欣欣向荣的城镇。早晨，火车到达温斯堡，她却不想下车。“这不是我原来想象的。你在这里怕日子不好过。”她说。火车开走了，两个人站在温斯堡行包负责人艾伯特·朗沃思的面前困惑不安，不知道该去哪里。","All through the night as the train rattled along, the grandmother told Tom tales of Winesburg and of how he would enjoy his life working in the fields and shooting wild things in the woods there.She could not believe that the tiny village of fifty years before had grown into a thriving town in her absence, and in the morning when the train came to Winesburg she did not want to get off.“It isn’t what I thought.It may be hard for you here,” she said, and then the train went on its way and the two stood confused, not knowing where to turn, in the presence of Albert Longworth, the Winesburg baggage master."
"可是汤姆·福斯特却过得很好。他是个随遇而安的人。他的外祖母被银行家的妻子怀特太太雇去当厨娘，而他自己则在这位银行家用砖新砌的马房里做小马官。","But Tom Foster did get along all right.He was one to get along anywhere.Mrs. White, the banker’s wife, employed his grandmother to work in the kitchen and he got a place as stable boy in the banker’s new brick barn."
"在温斯堡，找佣人很难。那位需要人帮忙做家务的太太雇佣了一个“女仆”，这个女仆坚持要跟这家人同桌吃饭。怀特太太讨厌这些女仆，于是抓住机会找到了这位来自城市的老妇人。她在马房的楼上给少年汤姆置办出了一间房。“不看马的时候，他可以修剪草坪，跑跑腿儿。”她对丈夫解释说。","In Winesburg servants were hard to get.The woman who wanted help in her housework employed a “hired girl” who insisted on sitting at the table with the family.Mrs. White was sick of hired girls and snatched at the chance to get hold of the old city woman. She furnished a room for the boy Tom upstairs in the barn.“He can mow the lawn and run errands when the horses do not need attention,” she explained to her husband."
"汤姆·福斯特看上去比实际年龄小得多，大大的脑袋上又黑又硬的头发根根直立。头发令他的头显得更大。他的声音轻柔之极，他本人也非常温顺和安静，所以当他静悄悄地进入小镇生活的时候，没有引起一丁点儿的注意。","Tom Foster was rather small for his age and had a large head covered with stiff black hair that stood straight up.The hair emphasized the bigness of his head.His voice was the softest thing imaginable, and he was himself so gentle and quiet that he slipped into the life of the town without attracting the least bit of attention."
"人们不禁好奇，汤姆·福斯特是如何养成这样温顺的脾气的。他住在辛辛那提时，邻居里有些匪里匪气的男孩子成群结伙地在街上晃荡。他最初成长的那几年就和那些小流氓一起到处跑。他做过一阵子电报公司的送信员，往附近散落着很多妓院的地区送信。妓院的女人们认识他，也喜欢他，那帮小混混们也喜欢他。","One could not help wondering where Tom Foster got his gentleness.In Cincinnati he had lived in a neighborhood where gangs of tough boys prowled through the streets, and all through his early formative years he ran about with tough boys.For a while he was a messenger for a telegraph company and delivered messages in a neighborhood sprinkled with houses of prostitution.The women in the houses knew and loved Tom Foster and the tough boys in the gangs loved him also."
"他从不表现自己。这个品质使他得以超脱。他以一种奇特的方式站在生活这面墙的阴影处，而且是故意站在阴影里。他看到妓院里男男女女的欲望，了解他们随便又可怕的情爱纠葛；他看到男孩子们打架，听他们说偷窃和酗酒的故事，可他不为所动，也奇怪地不受影响。","He never asserted himself.That was one thing that helped him escape.In an odd way he stood in the shadow of the wall of life, was meant to stand in the shadow.He saw the men and women in the houses of lust, sensed their casual and horrible love affairs, saw boys fighting and listened to their tales of thieving and drunkenness, unmoved and strangely unaffected."
"汤姆的确做过一次贼。那时他还住在城市里。外祖母那时病倒了，而他自己也没有找到工作。家里没有一点儿吃的，于是他进了小巷上的一家马具店，从装现金的抽屉里偷了一美元七十五美分。","Once Tom did steal.That was while he still lived in the city.The grandmother was ill at the time and he himself was out of work.There was nothing to eat in the house, and so he went into a harness shop on a side street and stole a dollar and seventy-five cents out of the cash drawer."
"这家马具店是一个长胡子老头开的。他看到这个男孩子躲在一边，并没当回事。当他到街上去同一个赶马的人谈话的时候，汤姆就打开了装现金的抽屉，拿了钱溜之大吉了。后来他被抓住了，外祖母以一个月每周给店主擦两次地板的条件平息了此事。这孩子很惭愧，可他也相当高兴。“羞愧是对的，这使我懂了一些新东西。”他对外祖母说。可外祖母不懂孩子在说些什么，可她那么爱他，懂不懂也没有关系。","The harness shop was run by an old man with a long mustache.He saw the boy lurking about and thought nothing of it.When he went out into the street to talk to a teamster Tom opened the cash drawer and taking the money walked away.Later he was caught and his grandmother settled the matter by offering to come twice a week for a month and scrub the shop.The boy was ashamed, but he was rather glad, too.“It is all right to be ashamed and makes me understand new things,” he said to the grandmother, who didn’t know what the boy was talking about but loved him so much that it didn’t matter whether she understood or not."
"汤姆·福斯特在银行家的马房里住了一年，然后丢了那儿的差事。他不太会看马，而且总是让那位银行家的太太生气。她让他修剪草坪，可他却忘记了。接着，她差他去商店或是邮局，可他却没有回去，而是加入了一帮男人和男孩中间，和他们一起消耗掉了整个下午。他闲站着，听人说话，偶尔被问及就说上几句。正如他在城市妓院里的待遇和晚间跟小流氓们走街串巷一样，他身处温斯堡居民中间总有本事融入其中，可又超脱其外。","For a year Tom Foster lived in the banker’s stable and then lost his place there.He didn’t take very good care of the horses and he was a constant source of irritation to the banker’s wife.She told him to mow the lawn and he forgot.Then she sent him to the store or to the post office and he did not come back but joined a group of men and boys and spent the whole afternoon with them, standing about, listening and occasionally, when addressed, saying a few words.As in the city in the houses of prostitution and with the rowdy boys running through the streets at night, so in Winesburg among its citizens he had always the power to be a part of and yet distinctly apart from the life about him."
"他失去怀特太太那里的工作后，便不同外婆住在一起了，但她常常在傍晚来看他。他在老鲁弗斯·怀廷的一座小木板房的后部租了一间房。那房子位于杜安街，就在大街的尽头，多年来一直被老人用来做律师事务所。现在老人年老体弱又健忘，无法再从事这个行当了，可他却没意识到自己的无能。他喜欢汤姆，便让他每月付一美元租金租了那间房。下午晚些时候，当律师回家后，少年有了自己的空间，就一连好几个小时躺在炉火边的地板上，想些事情。傍晚时分，外祖母来了，坐在律师的椅子上抽烟斗，而汤姆沉默着，就和他平时在大家面前一样。","After Tom lost his place at Banker White’s he did not live with his grandmother, although often in the evening she came to visit him.He rented a room at the rear of a little frame building belonging to old Rufus Whiting.The building was on Duane Street, just off Main Street, and had been used for years as a law office by the old man, who had become too feeble and forgetful for the practice of his profession but did not realize his inefficiency.He liked Tom and let him have the room for a dollar a month.In the late afternoon when the lawyer had gone home the boy had the place to himself and spent hours lying on the floor by the stove and thinking of things.In the evening the grandmother came and sat in the lawyer’s chair to smoke a pipe while Tom remained silent, as he always, did in the presence of everyone."
"这位老妇人经常精力充沛地说话。有时，她会对银行家家里发生的事情感到生气，一连骂上好几个钟头。她用自己赚的钱买了一个拖把，经常打扫律师的办公室。于是，等整个房间一尘不染，空气也清新时，她就点燃她那只陶制的烟斗，和汤姆一起抽烟。“要是你准备去死，我也会死的。”她对躺在自己椅子旁的地板上的少年说。","Often the old woman talked with great vigor. Sometimes she was angry about some happening at the banker’s house and scolded away for hours.Out of her own earnings she bought a mop and regularly scrubbed the lawyer’s office.Then when the place was spotlessly clean and smelled clean she lighted her clay pipe and she and Tom had a smoke together.“When you get ready to die then I will die also,” she said to the boy lying on the floor beside her chair."
"汤姆·福斯特很享受在温斯堡的生活。他打零工，比方说给厨房的炉子砍柴，割一割房子前的草。五月末到六月初，他就到田地里去摘草莓。他有时间到处闲晃，并享受其中。银行家怀特曾给过他一件不要了的外套，可他穿太大了，于是外祖母把它改小。他还有一件毛皮衬里的大衣，也是从那儿得来的。毛皮有的地方脱落了，但外套却很暖和，冬天汤姆就穿着它睡觉。他觉得自己的生活方式很好，对于在温斯堡的生活感到开心，也很满足。","Tom Foster enjoyed life in Winesburg.He did odd jobs, such as cutting wood for kitchen stoves and mowing the grass before houses.In late May and early June he picked strawberries in the fields.He had time to loaf and he enjoyed loafing.Banker White had given him a cast-off coat which was too large for him, but his grandmother cut it down, and he had also an overcoat, got at the same place, that was lined with fur.The fur was worn away in spots, but the coat was warm and in the winter Tom slept in it.He thought his method of getting along good enough and was happy and satisfied with the way life in Winesburg had turned out for him."
"最荒唐的小事也能使他高兴。我想，这就是人们喜欢他的原因。在赫恩的杂货店，他们会在周五的下午煮咖啡，那是为周六的生意高峰期做准备，浓郁的香味传遍了大街的下段。汤姆·福斯特出现了，坐在商店后面的一个箱子上。他会安静地坐上一个小时，一动不动，让自己沐浴在香味中，快乐得有些陶醉。“我喜欢它。”他轻轻地说，“它使我想起遥远的东西，像这样的地方和东西。”","The most absurd little things made Tom Foster happy.That, I suppose, was why people loved him.In Hern’s Grocery they would be roasting coffee on Friday afternoon, preparatory to the Saturday rush of trade, and the rich odor invaded lower Main Street.Tom Foster appeared and sat on a box at the rear of the store.For an hour he did not move but sat perfectly still, filling his being with the spicy odor that made him half drunk with happiness.“I like it,” he said gently.“It makes me think of things far away, places and things like that.”"
"有一夜，汤姆·福斯特喝醉了。这事情发生得稀奇古怪。他以前从未醉酒，事实上他一生中从没喝过任何使人兴奋的东西，可他觉得有必要醉一次，所以就那么干了。","One night Tom Foster got drunk.That came about in a curious way.He never had been drunk before, and indeed in all his life had never taken a drink of anything intoxicating, but he felt he needed to be drunk that one time and so went and did it."
"汤姆住在辛辛那提的时候，他发现了许多东西，诸如丑陋、罪恶和肉欲之类的东西。实际上，他比温斯堡的所有人都要更加懂得这些东西。尤其是性事，曾以一种恐怖的方式展现在他面前，因此在他心里流下了深刻的印象。他觉得，在他看到在寒冷的夜晚站在肮脏的房门前的妓女们，以及停下来和她们谈话的男人们眼中的神情之后，他便将性这件事完全摒弃在自己的生活之外。一次，邻居有个女人勾引他，他便跟着她进了房间。他永远也忘不了那个房间里的气味和那个女人眼中流露出的急色。那使他感到恶心，并以一种糟糕的方式在他的心灵中留下了一道伤疤。之前，他总以为女人是非常单纯的，就像他的外祖母，可在那间房里的经历过后，他将女人赶出了自己的脑海。他的天性非常温柔，因此不会去恨任何东西，所以因为无法理解，他决定忘记。","In Cincinnati, when he lived there, Tom had found out many things, things about ugliness and crime and lust.Indeed, he knew more of these things than anyone else in Winesburg.The matter of sex in particular had presented itself to him in a quite horrible way and had made a deep impression on his mind.He thought, after what he had seen of the women standing before the squalid houses on cold nights and the look he had seen in the eyes of the men who stopped to talk to them, that he would put sex altogether out of his own life.One of the women of the neighborhood tempted him once and he went into a room with her.He never forgot the smell of the room nor the greedy look that came into the eyes of the woman.It sickened him and in a very terrible way left a scar on his soul.He had always before thought of women as quite innocent things, much like his grandmother, but after that one experience in the room he dismissed women from his mind.So gentle was his nature that he could not hate anything and not being able to understand he decided to forget."
"而且直到来温斯堡前，汤姆确实已经忘记了。可他在那儿住了两年之后，开始有些骚动不安。他到处看到有年轻人做爱，而他本身也是一个年轻人。他还不知道怎么回事就已经陷入爱河了。他爱上了海伦·怀特，他曾打工的老板家的女儿，他发觉自己在夜里也在想她。","And Tom did forget until he came to Winesburg.After he had lived there for two years something began to stir in him.On all sides he saw youth making love and he was himself a youth.Before he knew what had happened he was in love also.He fell in love with Helen White, daughter of the man for whom he had worked, and found himself thinking of her at night."
"这对汤姆而言是个难题，他便用自己的方式解决。每当海伦·怀特的身影出现在他的脑海，他便放任自己想着她，他只关心自己的思考方法。他同自己搏斗，一种静静的、坚决的小型搏斗，从而使他的欲望回归到他所认为的正途。可总体来说，他是胜利的。","That was a problem for Tom and he settled it in his own way.He let himself think of Helen White whenever her figure came into his mind and only concerned himself with the manner of his thoughts.He had a fight, a quiet determined little fight of his own, to keep his desires in the channel where he thought they belonged, but on the whole he was victorious."
"接着便发生了春日夜晚的酒醉一事。汤姆在那晚变得很狂野。他就像森林里一头单纯的年轻雄鹿，吃了某种令人发疯的草。整件事在一个晚上开始，发展和结束。可以确信，温斯堡没有第二个人比汤姆爆发得更厉害。","And then came the spring night when he got drunk.Tom was wild on that night.He was like an innocent young buck of the forest that has eaten of some maddening weed.The thing began, ran its course, and was ended in one night, and you may be sure that no one in Winesburg was any the worse for Tom’s outbreak."
"首先，那是个使天性敏感的人喝醉的夜晚。小镇住宅区街道旁的树都披上了一身嫩绿的新叶；屋后的花园里男人们在菜园里闲逛；空气里有一种寂静，一种等待的沉默，使人热血澎湃。","In the first place, the night was one to make a sensitive nature drunk.The trees along the residence streets of the town were all newly clothed in soft green leaves, in the gardens behind the houses men were puttering about in vegetable gardens, and in the air there was a hush, a waiting kind of silence very stirring to the blood."
"夜幕刚刚降临，汤姆便离开了他在杜安大街的房间。起初，他在街上散步，轻轻地、安静地走着，思考着他想要转化成语言的思绪。他说海伦·怀特就像空气中跳动的火焰，而他自己则是一株小小的无叶树，突兀地站在天幕下。接着，他说她是一阵风，一阵狂风，从黑暗的波浪滔天的海上吹来，而他就是一艘被渔夫留在海边的船。","Tom left his room on Duane Street just as the young night began to make itself felt.First he walked through the streets, going softly and quietly along, thinking thoughts that he tried to put into words.He said that Helen White was a flame dancing in the air and that he was a little tree without leaves standing out sharply against the sky.Then he said that she was a wind, a strong terrible wind, coming out of the darkness of a stormy sea and that he was a boat left on the shore of the sea by a fisherman."
"这个想法令少年感到愉快，他一边散步一边玩味着。他来到大街上，在瓦克尔烟草店门前的石栏上坐下来。他逗留了一个小时，听着人们交谈，但他并不太感兴趣，于是就溜走了。然后，他决定去大醉一场，就走进了威利酒吧，买了一瓶威士忌。他将酒瓶放进口袋，走出小镇，想要独处来思考更多的想法，并喝威士忌。","That idea pleased the boy and he sauntered along playing with it.He went into Main Street and sat on the curbing before Wacker’s tobacco store.For an hour he lingered about listening to the talk of men, but it did not interest him much and he slipped away.Then he decided to get drunk and went into Willy’s saloon and bought a bottle of whiskey.Putting the bottle into his pocket, he walked out of town, wanting to be alone to think more thoughts and to drink the whiskey."
"汤姆坐在镇北一英里马路边新生的草坪上，喝醉了。他面前是一条白色的马路，身后是鲜花盛开的苹果园。他从酒瓶里喝了一口酒，然后就躺倒在草地上。他想起了温斯堡的清晨，还有怀特家旁边的马路上的石子，在晨光里因露水的湿润而发着光。他想起了在马房里的夜晚，下雨的时候他醒着躺在那儿，听着雨水的滴答声，闻着马匹和干草发出的温暖的气味。接着，他还想起了几天前咆哮着席卷整个温斯堡的那场暴风雨。他的思绪继续向前，重又想起了他们祖孙两人从辛辛那提而来，在火车上渡过的那个夜晚。他清楚地记得：静静地坐在座位上，感受发动机推动火车在夜里飞驰的力量，那感觉是那么新奇。","Tom got drunk sitting on a bank of new grass beside the road about a mile north of town.Before him was a white road and at his back an apple orchard in full bloom.He took a drink out of the bottle and then lay down on the grass.He thought of mornings in Winesburg and of how the stones in the graveled driveway by Banker White’s house were wet with dew and glistened in the morning light.He thought of the nights in the barn when it rained and he lay awake hearing the drumming of the raindrops and smelling the warm smell of horses and of hay.Then he thought of a storm that had gone roaring through Winesburg several days before and, his mind going back, he relived the night he had spent on the train with his grandmother when the two were coming from Cincinnati.Sharply he remembered how strange it had seemed to sit quietly in the coach and to feel the power of the engine hurling the train along through the night."
"汤姆很快就喝醉了。他在思考的时候不停地从酒瓶里喝着酒，然后他开始觉得头晕，于是站起身，沿着马路离开温斯堡。从温斯堡的北部通向伊利湖的马路上有一座桥，喝醉的少年就沿着这条路往桥上而去。他在那里坐下来。他试图再接着喝，可是他一拔开酒瓶的木塞便觉得难受，于是很快又塞回去。他的头前摇后晃的，于是他坐在靠近桥的石头上叹息。他的头好像风车般飞转着，接着头向前点去，四肢不受控制地晃动。","Tom got drunk in a very short time.He kept taking drinks from the bottle as the thoughts visited him and when his head began to reel he got up and walked along the road going away from Winesburg.There was a bridge on the road that ran out of Winesburg north to Lake Erie and the drunken boy made his way along the road to the bridge.There he sat down.He tried to drink again, but when he had taken the cork out of the bottle he became ill and put it quickly back.His head was rocking back and forth and so he sat on the stone approach to the bridge and sighed.His head seemed to be flying about like a pinwheel and then projecting itself off into space and his arms and legs flopped helplessly about."
"11点的时候，汤姆回到镇上。乔治·威拉德看到他在闲逛，便将他带到了《鹰报》的印刷室。继而他怕这个醉酒的少年会把地板弄脏，就扶他到过道里。","At eleven o’clock Tom got back into town.George Willard found him wandering about and took him into the Eagle printshop.Then he became afraid that the drunken boy would make a mess on the floor and helped him into the alleyway."
"记者被汤姆·福斯特给弄糊涂了。喝醉的少年提到了海伦·怀特，说他曾和她到过海边，同她做过爱。乔治曾在傍晚见过海伦·怀特同她的父亲在街上散步，因此断定汤姆已经头脑不清了。潜藏在他内心的对海伦·怀特的情感被点燃，于是他生气了。“你别再说了，”他说，“我不会让海伦·怀特的名字和这种事扯上关系的。我不会让这种事发生。”他开始摇晃汤姆的肩膀，想让他清醒过来。“你别说了。”他再次说道。","The reporter was confused by Tom Foster.The drunken boy talked of Helen White and said he had been with her on the shore of a sea and had made love to her.George had seen Helen White walking in the street with her father during the evening and decided that Tom was out of his head.A sentiment concerning Helen White that lurked in his own heart flamed up and he became angry.“Now you quit that,” he said.“I won’t let Helen White’s name be dragged into this.I won’t let that happen.”He began shaking Tom’s shoulder, trying to make him understand.“You quit it,” he said again."
"这两个年轻人莫名其妙地遇到一起，在印刷室里呆了三个钟头。等到汤姆有些清醒的时候，乔治就带他出去走走。他们来到乡间，坐在树林边的一根木头上。宁静的夜晚里有些什么东西将他们拉到一起，当醉酒的男孩子开始清醒的时候，他们谈了起来。","For three hours the two young men, thus strangely thrown together, stayed in the printshop.When he had a little recovered George took Tom for a walk.They went into the country and sat on a log near the edge of a wood.Something in the still night drew them together and when the drunken boy’s head began to clear they talked."
"“喝醉是件好事。”汤姆·福斯特说，“它教会我一些事。我不会再这么做了。此后，我会想得更明白的。你明白是怎么回事。”","“It was good to be drunk,” Tom Foster said.“It taught me something.I won’t have to do it again.I will think more dearly after this.You see how it is.”"
"乔治·威拉德不明白，可他关于海伦·怀特的那股怒火已经过去，他被这个苍白、全身发抖的少年吸引住了，他以前从没被任何人吸引过。他带着一种母亲般的担心，坚持要汤姆站起来走动走动。他们又走回印刷室，沉默地坐在黑暗中。","George Willard did not see, but his anger concerning Helen White passed and he felt drawn toward the pale, shaken boy as he had never before been drawn toward anyone.With motherly solicitude, he insisted that Tom get to his feet and walk about.Again they went back to the printshop and sat in silence in the darkness."
"记者没办法弄懂汤姆·福斯特行为的意图。当汤姆再次谈到海伦·怀特时，他便又生气起来，开始斥责他。“你别说了，”他严厉地说，“你和她没有在一起过。为什么你要说有？是什么让你一直说这些事？现在你别再说了，听见没有？”","The reporter could not get the purpose of Tom Foster’s action straightened out in his mind.When Tom spoke again of Helen White he again grew angry and began to scold. “You quit that,” he said sharply.“You haven’t been with her.What makes you say you have?What makes you keep saying such things?Now you quit it, do you hear?”"
"汤姆觉得受到了伤害。他无法同乔治·威拉德争吵，因为他不善吵架，于是他站起来准备离开。乔治·威拉德很坚持，汤姆便将手放在这个年长些的少年的胳膊上，试图解释。","Tom was hurt.He couldn’t quarrel with George Willard because he was incapable of quarreling, so he got up to go away.When George Willard was insistent he put out his hand, laying it on the older boy’s arm, and tried to explain."
"“好吧，”他轻声地说，“我也不知道是怎么回事。我很快乐。你看，就是这样。海伦·怀特使我快乐，夜晚也使我快乐。我希望痛苦，受点伤害。我觉得那是我该做的事。我希望痛苦，你看，因为每个人都在受苦，也会做错事。我想要做很多事情，可都没有用。那都会伤害到其他人。”","“Well,” he said softly, “I don’t know how it was.I was happy.You see how that was.Helen White made me happy and the night did too.I wanted to suffer, to be hurt somehow.I thought that was what I should do.I wanted to suffer, you see, because everyone suffers and does wrong.I thought of a lot of things to do, but they wouldn’t work.They all hurt someone else.”"
"汤姆·福斯特的声音抬高了，他长这么大头一次几乎激动起来。“就好比是做爱，我就是那个意思。”他解释说，“你难道不懂是怎么回事吗？做我做过的事情会使我受到伤害，让每件事情都变得奇怪。这就是我这么做的原因。我也很高兴。它教会我一些东西，就是这样，这就是我要的。你还不明白吗？我想学习东西，你看。这就是我这么干的原因。“","Tom Foster’s voice arose, and for once in his life he became almost excited. “It was like making love, that’s what I mean,” he explained.“Don’t you see how it is?It hurt me to do what I did and made everything strange.That’s why I did it.I’m glad, too.It taught me something, that’s it, that’s what I wanted.Don’t you understand?I wanted to learn things, you see.That’s why I did it.”"
"第十九章 死亡","CHAPTER 19 DEATH"
"瑞菲医生的诊所位于赫夫纳街区的帕里斯干货店的楼上，通向诊所的楼梯里只有昏暗的灯光。楼梯口挂着一盏灯，灯罩脏兮兮的，被用一个支架固定在了墙上。灯上有一个锡制的反光镜，锈成了褐色，上面布满了灰尘。上楼的人循着以前来过的人留下的脚印往上爬。软绵绵的楼梯板在脚步的压力下凹陷，深深的凹痕留在了这条路上。","The stairway leading up to Doctor Reefy’s office, in the Heffner Block above the Paris Dry Goods store, was but dimly lighted.At the head of the stairway hung a lamp with a dirty chimney that was fastened by a bracket to the wall.The lamp had a tin reflector, brown with rust and covered with dust.The people who went up the stairway followed with their feet the feet of many who had gone before.The soft boards of the stairs had yielded under the pressure of feet and deep hollows marked the way."
"上到楼顶，往右转就到了医生的门口。左边是个昏暗的走廊，里面堆满了废品。旧凳子、木匠的脚架、步梯，还有空箱子，都堆在黑暗里，随时都会蹭破小腿。这堆废弃物属于帕里斯干货公司。每当店里的一个柜台或是一排架子没用了，店员便搬上楼梯，堆在上面。","At the top of the stairway a turn to the right brought you to the doctor’s door.To the left was a dark hallway filled with rubbish.Old chairs, carpenter’s horses, step ladders and empty boxes lay in the darkness waiting for shins to be barked.The pile of rubbish belonged to the Paris Dry Goods Company.When a counter or a row of shelves in the store became useless, clerks carried it up the stairway and threw it on the pile."
"瑞菲医生的诊所大得像个仓库。房间的中央是个圆形的火炉。炉子的底座堆着木屑，用钉在地板上的大厚板归拢在一起。门边放了一张超大的桌子，那曾经是赫里克服装店的一件家具，曾用来展示定制服装的。桌上面放满了书、药瓶和外科仪器。桌子边沿上放了三四个苹果，是约翰·斯帕尼亚德留下来的，他是瑞菲医生的朋友，是个护林员。苹果是他进门的时候悄悄从口袋里拿出来的。","Doctor Reefy’s office was as large as a barn.A stove with a round paunch sat in the middle of the room.Around its base was piled sawdust, held in place by heavy planks nailed to the floor.By the door stood a huge table that had once been a part of the furniture of Herrick’s Clothing Store and that had been used for displaying custom-made clothes.It was covered with books, bottles, and surgical instruments.Near the edge of the table lay three or four apples left by John Spaniard, a tree nurseryman who was Doctor Reefy’s friend, and who had slipped the apples out of his pocket as he came in at the door."
"瑞菲医生是个中年人，个子很高，可有些笨拙。他后来长的灰色胡须还没冒出来，可嘴上面却长着棕色的小胡子。他不是一个优雅的人，随着年纪渐老，越发觉得手脚不知放在哪里好了。","At middle age Doctor Reefy was tall and awkward.The grey beard he later wore had not yet appeared, but on the upper lip grew a brown mustache.He was not a graceful man, as when he grew older, and was much occupied with the problem of disposing of his hands and feet."
"伊丽莎白·威拉德结婚多年，儿子乔治已经十二或十四岁了。夏日的午后，她有时会爬上老旧的楼梯来找瑞菲医生看病。这个女人天生的高挑身材已经开始萎缩，她无精打采地拖着身子四处走动。表面上她是因为健康的原因来找医生看病，可有五六次，她来见他的目的并不主要是为了看病。她和医生会谈及她的身体状况，可他们大多数时候是在谈她的生活，他们两个人的生活，以及他们在温斯堡生活时曾经有的一些想法。","On summer afternoons, when she had been married many years and when her son George was a boy of twelve or fourteen, Elizabeth Willard sometimes went up the worn steps to Doctor Reefy’s office.Already the woman’s naturally tall figure had begun to droop and to drag itself listlessly about.Ostensibly she went to see the doctor because of her health, but on the half dozen occasions when she had been to see him the outcome of the visits did not primarily concern her health.She and the doctor talked of that but they talked most of her life, of their two lives and of the ideas that had come to them as they lived their lives in Winesburg."
"这个男人和这位妇女坐在大而空荡的办公室里，彼此注视着，他们有很多相似的地方。他们的身体不同，眼睛的颜色也不同，鼻子的长度和生存的环境也不相同。可是，他们内在的某些东西是一样的，他们都想要解脱，都会在旁观者的记忆里留下相同的印象。后来，他变老了，却娶了一位年轻的妻子。医生经常向她谈到他与那个女病人在一起度过的时光，说了很多他当时无法对伊丽莎白表达的话。他老年的时候几乎成了一个诗人，对发生的事情的认知有了一种富有诗意的转变。“我的人生中曾有过一段日子祷告变得极为必要，因此我造了一些神，并向他们祈祷。”他说，“我不用语言做祷告，也不下跪，而是静静地坐在我的椅子上。傍晚时分，大街上燥热而安静的时候，或是在冬日，天气阴沉的时候，这些神就会造访我的诊所，我想没人知道他们。后来我发现那个名叫伊丽莎白的女人是知道的，她也膜拜过同样的神。我觉得她到我的诊所来是因为她相信那些神会在那里，而且也因为发现自己并不孤单而感到高兴。这是一种很难解释的经历，尽管我猜想它总是发生在各个地方的男男女女身上。”","In the big empty office the man and the woman sat looking at each other and they were a good deal alike.Their bodies were different, as were also the color of their eyes, the length of their noses, and the circumstances of their existence, but something inside them meant the same thing, wanted the same release, would have left the same impression on the memory of an onlooker.Later, and when he grew older and married a young wife, the doctor often talked to her of the hours spent with the sick woman and expressed a good many things he had been unable to express to Elizabeth.He was almost a poet in his old age and his notion of what happened took a poetic turn.“I had come to the time in my life when prayer became necessary and so I invented gods and prayed to them,” he said.“I did not say my prayers in words nor did I kneel down but sat perfectly still in my chair.In the late afternoon when it was hot and quiet on Main Street or in the winter when the days were gloomy, the gods came into the office and I thought no one knew about them.Then I found that this woman Elizabeth knew, that she worshipped also the same gods.I have a notion that she came to the office because she thought the gods would be there but she was happy to find herself not alone just the same.It was an experience that cannot be explained, although I suppose it is always happening to men and women in all sorts of places.”"
"夏日的午后，伊丽莎白和医生坐在诊所里，谈起他们两人各自的生活，也谈到了其他人的生活。有时，医生会说些哲人般的警世箴言。然后，他自己乐得咯咯笑。时不时的，在一段沉默过后，他们会说上一两个字或者给出某个暗示，由此奇怪地启发了说话者的生活。于是，希望变成了欲望或是梦想，本以几乎熄灭，却又突然被重新点燃。大多数时候，话是那位妇女说的，说的时候她并不看着那个男人。","On the summer afternoons when Elizabeth and the doctor sat in the office and talked of their two lives they talked of other lives also.Sometimes the doctor made philosophic epigrams.Then he chuckled with amusement.Now and then after a period of silence, a word was said or a hint given that strangely illuminated the life of the speaker, a wish became a desire, or a dream, half dead, flared suddenly into life.For the most part the words came from the woman and she said them without looking at the man."
"每次这个旅社老板娘来看医生都会在说话的时候变得更自如一些。在医生面前呆上一两个钟头后，她走下楼来到大街上，感到焕然一新，并重新有力量去面对自己沉闷的生活。她用一种近乎少女的姿势摇摇摆摆地走回去，可一旦她坐回到自己房间窗边的椅子上，夜幕降临，女仆从旅社餐厅用托盘把她的晚餐端来，她则任由它慢慢地冷掉。她的思绪奔回到自己的少女时期，那时充满了对冒险的狂热渴望。她记得那些抱住她的男人的臂膀，那时冒险对她而言触手可及。她特别记得那个曾经做过她情人的男子，在激情的时刻不下一百次地对她高喊着，一遍又一遍疯狂地说着同样的话：“亲爱的！亲爱的！我最亲爱的！”她想，这些话说出了她原本想在生活中寻觅的东西。","Each time she came to see the doctor the hotel keeper’s wife talked a little more freely and after an hour or two in his presence went down the stairway into Main Street feeling renewed and strengthened against the dullness of her days.With something approaching a girlhood swing to her body she walked along, but when she had got back to her chair by the window of her room and when darkness had come on and a girl from the hotel dining room brought her dinner on a tray, she let it grow cold.Her thoughts ran away to her girlhood with its passionate longing for adventure and she remembered the arms of men that had held her when adventure was a possible thing for her.Particularly she remembered one who had for a time been her lover and who in the moment of his passion had cried out to her more than a hundred times, saying the same words madly over and over: “You dear! You dear! You lovely dear!”The words, she thought, expressed something she would have liked to have achieved in life."
"在这家破旧的旅店里，生病的老板娘在自己的房间里开始呜咽，双手捂着脸，前后摇晃着。她唯一的朋友瑞菲医生的话在她耳边回响。","In her room in the shabby old hotel the sick wife of the hotel keeper began to weep and, putting her hands to her face, rocked back and forth.The words of her one friend, Doctor Reefy, rang in her ears."
"“爱情就像一阵风，在漆黑的夜晚拂动树下的草地。”他曾说过，“你切勿试图将爱确定。那是生活中一次神圣的意外。如果你试图确定和确信爱，并跑到那温柔的夜风拂过的树下去生活，那么漫长炎热的白昼会立即令你失望，来往的车马扬起的沙尘会堆积在你因亲吻而红肿的娇柔双唇上。”","“Love is like a wind stirring the grass beneath trees on a black night,” he had said.“You must not try to make love definite.It is the divine accident of life.If you try to be definite and sure about it and to live beneath the trees, where soft night winds blow, the long hot day of disappointment comes swiftly and the gritty dust from passing wagons gathers upon lips inflamed and made tender by kisses.”"
"伊丽莎白·威拉德记不起她的母亲了，母亲在她只有五岁的时候就死了。她的少女时代过得糟糕至极。她的父亲喜欢清净，不被打扰，可是旅社的事务无法让他清净自在。他活着的时候也在生病，最后一病呜呼。他每天兴高采烈地起床，可到了早上十点，所有的欢乐就都从他心里消失了。每当有客人投诉旅社的餐厅收费，或是铺床的女仆因为结婚而离开的时候，他就跺着地板咒骂。到了晚上上床时，他想到女儿在这些进进出出、川流不息的人群中长大，便悲从中来。等到女儿长大些，开始在傍晚同男子外出散步的时候，他想和她谈谈，他试过却没有成功。他总是忘记想说的话，时间都花在抱怨他自己的事情上了。","Elizabeth Willard could not remember her mother who had died when she was but five years old.Her girlhood had been lived in the most haphazard manner imaginable.Her father was a man who had wanted to be let alone and the affairs of the hotel would not let him alone.He also had lived and died a sick man.Every day he arose with a cheerful face, but by ten o’clock in the morning all the joy had gone out of his heart.When a guest complained of the fare in the hotel dining room or one of the girls who made up the beds got married and went away, he stamped on the floor and swore.At night when he went to bed he thought of his daughter growing up among the stream of people that drifted in and out of the hotel and was overcome with sadness.As the girl grew older and began to walk out in the evening with men he wanted to talk to her, but when he tried was not successful.He always forgot what he wanted to say and spent the time complaining of his own affairs."
"在她的女孩和少女时期，伊丽莎白曾试图在生活中做一个真正的冒险家。十八岁时，她对生活如此着迷，因此失去了童贞。然而，尽管在嫁给汤姆·威拉德之前她有过6个情人，她却从没仅仅受欲望驱使而冒过一次险。和世上的所有女人一样，她想要一个真正的情人。她总是盲目而又充满激情地寻找人生中隐藏的某种惊奇。这个摇摇摆摆地迈开大步、同男人们在树林下散步的高个子美丽姑娘，总是把手伸到黑暗里，试图去握住另一个人的手。从那些与她冒险的男人们嘴里源源不断地说出来的话中，她试图找出对她的真心话。","In her girlhood and young womanhood Elizabeth had tried to be a real adventurer in life.At eighteen life had so gripped her that she was no longer a virgin but, although she had a half dozen lovers before she married Tom Willard, she had never entered upon an adventure prompted by desire alone.Like all the women in the world, she wanted a real lover.Always there was something she sought blindly, passionately, some hidden wonder in life.The tall beautiful girl with the swinging stride who had walked under the trees with men was forever putting out her hand into the darkness and trying to get hold of some other hand.In all the babble of words that fell from the lips of the men with whom she adventured she was trying to find what would be for her the true word."
"伊丽莎白嫁给了她父亲旅社里的一个伙计汤姆·威拉德，因为当她下定决心结婚的时候，他就在面前，而且在那时他也想要结婚。有一阵子，她像大多数的年轻女孩一样，认为婚姻将会改变生活的面貌。如果她心里曾对与汤姆结婚的结果有过疑虑，她也将它忽略掉。当时，她的父亲病入膏肓，她也因刚刚结束了一场毫无意义的恋爱而十分困惑。温斯堡其他像她这样年纪的女孩们都在准备嫁人，对象都是她认识的人、杂货店的店员或是年轻的农夫。她们晚上同丈夫在大街上散步。当她经过时，她们会露出幸福的笑容。于是她开始想，婚姻这件事可能饱含着某种隐秘的意义。同她交谈的年轻妻子们说起话来轻言细语，娇羞无限。“有个自己的男人就会很不同了。”她们如是说。","Elizabeth had married Tom Willard, a clerk in her father’s hotel, because he was at hand and wanted to marry at the time when the determination to marry came to her.For a while, like most young girls, she thought marriage would change the face of life.If there was in her mind a doubt of the outcome of the marriage with Tom she brushed it aside.Her father was ill and near death at the time and she was perplexed because of the meaningless outcome of an affair in which she had just been involved.Other girls of her age in Winesburg were marrying men she had always known, grocery clerks or young farmers.In the evening they walked in Main Street with their husbands and when she passed they smiled happily.She began to think that the fact of marriage might be full of some hidden significance.Young wives with whom she talked spoke softly and shyly.“It changes things to have a man of your own,” they said."
"新婚的前一夜，这个困惑的姑娘和父亲有过一次谈话。后来，她怀疑是不是和生病的父亲单独在一起的那几个小时才导致她嫁人的决定。父亲谈及自己的生活，忠告女儿不要使自己陷入同样的困境。他大骂汤姆·威拉德，这使得伊丽莎白为那位伙计辩护。病重的父亲愈发激动，挣扎着要下床。当她阻止他下床走动的时候，他开始抱怨。“我从没有清静过。”他说，“尽管我努力地工作，可还是没能让旅社赚到钱。甚至现在我还欠着银行的钱。等我死了你就会发现的。”","On the evening before her marriage the perplexed girl had a talk with her father.Later she wondered if the hours alone with the sick man had led to her decision to marry.The father talked of his life and advised the daughter to avoid being led into another such muddle.He abused Tom Willard, and that led Elizabeth to come to the clerk’s defense.The sick man became excited and tried to get out of bed.When she would not let him walk about he began to complain.“I’ve never been let alone,” he said.“Although I’ve worked hard I’ve not made the hotel pay.Even now I owe money at the bank.You’ll find that out when I’m gone.”"
"病人的声音因为认真而紧张起来。因为站不起来，他伸出手把女儿的头拉下来挨着自己。“有个解决的办法。”他低声说，“别嫁给汤姆·威拉德或者温斯堡的任何人。在我箱子的锡盒里有八百美元，你拿上钱离开吧。”","The voice of the sick man became tense with earnestness.Being unable to arise, he put out his hand and pulled the girl’s head down beside his own.“There’s a way out,” he whispered.“Don’t marry Tom Willard or anyone else here in Winesburg.There is eight hundred dollars in a tin box in my trunk.Take it and go away.”"
"病人的声音重又变得怨声不断。“你得保证，”他说道，“如果你不答应不嫁人，就向我保证，永远不要告诉汤姆钱的事情。那是我的钱，如果我给了你，就有权提出要求。把钱藏起来。这是我作为一个失败的父亲对你的补偿。某个时候，它能为你打开一扇门，一扇敞开的大门。好了，我跟你说我快死了，向我保证。”","Again the sick man’s voice became querulous.“You’ve got to promise,” he declared.“If you won’t promise not to marry, give me your word that you’ll never tell Tom about the money.It is mine and if I give it to you I’ve the right to make that demand.Hide it away.It is to make up to you for my failure as a father.Some time it may prove to be a door, a great open door to you.Come now, I tell you I’m about to die, give me your promise.”"
"伊丽莎白，这位四十一岁、疲惫瘦削的老女人，坐在瑞菲医生诊所火炉边的一张椅子上，眼睛望着地面。医生坐在靠窗的一张小书桌旁。他手里玩弄着一支放在桌上的铅笔。伊丽莎白谈到她结婚以后的生活。她变得很冷漠，也忘了自己的丈夫，只在讲述自己故事的时候将他作为一个道具。“后来我结了婚，发现根本不是那么回事。”她痛苦地说，“我一结婚就开始害怕。或许是我以前懂得太多，又或许在我和他的初夜我发现了太多。我记不清了。","In Doctor Reefy’s office, Elizabeth, a tired gaunt old woman at forty-one, sat in a chair near the stove and looked at the floor.By a small desk near the window sat the doctor.His hands played with a lead pencil that lay on the desk.Elizabeth talked of her life as a married woman.She became impersonal and forgot her husband, only using him as a lay figure to give point to her tale.“And then I was married and it did not turn out at all,” she said bitterly.“As soon as I had gone into it I began to be afraid.Perhaps I knew too much before and then perhaps I found out too much during my first night with him.I don’t remember."
"“我真是个傻瓜。我的爸爸给我那笔钱，尽力劝说我不要结婚，我却没有听。我想到了结了婚的女孩子们说过的关于婚姻的话，所以我也想结婚了。汤姆并非我想要的，我想要的是婚姻。爸爸睡着的时候我从窗户里探出身去，想到我过去的生活。我不想做个坏女人。小镇里到处都是关于我的流言。我甚至开始害怕汤姆会改变主意。”","“What a fool I was.When father gave me the money and tried to talk me out of the thought of marriage, I would not listen.I thought of what the girls who were married had said of it and I wanted marriage also.It wasn’t Tom I wanted, it was marriage.When father went to sleep I leaned out of the window and thought of the life I had led.I didn’t want to be a bad woman.The town was full of stories about me.I even began to be afraid Tom would change his mind.”"
"女人的声音因为激动而颤抖起来。瑞菲医生已经开始爱上了她，但他自己却没有察觉，于是产生了奇怪的幻觉。他觉得这个妇女在讲述的时候，她的身体正在发生着变化，她变得年轻、挺拔、强壮了。当他无法摆脱这个幻像时，便在心里做了一个专业性的歪解。“这样的谈话对她的身心都有好处。”他低声说道。","The woman’s voice began to quiver with excitement.To Doctor Reefy, who without realizing what was happening had begun to love her, there came an odd illusion.He thought that as she talked the woman’s body was changing, that she was becoming younger, straighter, stronger.When he could not shake off the illusion his mind gave it a professional twist.“It is good for both her body and her mind, this talking,” he muttered."
"这位妇人开始讲述结婚数月之后的一个下午所发生的一件小事。她的声音开始平静了下来。“傍晚的时候，我独自驾马车外出。”她说，“我在莫耶的车行养了一辆马车和一匹灰色的小马。汤姆在旅社里粉刷房间，重贴墙纸。他需要钱，我也准备打定主意告诉他我爸爸留给我的八百块钱。可我下不了决心这么做。我还不够喜欢他。那段时间，他的手上和脸上总是有油漆，闻起来也一股油漆味。他想把老旅社翻新，让它变得崭新而时髦。”","The woman began telling of an incident that had happened one afternoon a few months after her marriage.Her voice became steadier.“In the late afternoon I went for a drive alone,” she said.“I had a buggy and a little grey pony I kept in Moyer’s Livery.Tom was painting and repapering rooms in the hotel.He wanted money and I was trying to make up my mind to tell him about the eight hundred dollars father had given to me.I couldn’t decide to do it.I didn’t like him well enough.There was always paint on his hands and face during those days and he smelled of paint.He was trying to fix up the old hotel, and make it new and smart.”"
"在她说起那个春天的下午她驾车独自出行的时候，这个兴奋的女人在椅子坐得笔直，用手飞快地做了一个女孩子气的动作。“那天阴云密布，快要下暴雨的样子。”她说，“乌云衬得树木和青草的绿色分外鲜明，那颜色刺痛了我的眼睛。我走出特鲁连山峰一英里多，然后转下一条小道。小马驹快速地沿着山路上下奔跑。我没了耐心。思绪纷沓而至，而我想摆脱这些思绪。我开始抽打小马。乌云聚集，天开始下雨了。我想要飞奔，永远这样驰骋下去。我要离开小镇，脱掉衣服，摆脱婚姻，丢掉这个躯壳，抛弃一切。我不停地让马奔跑，快把马给累死了。当马跑不动了，我便从马车上下来，徒步朝着黑暗奔去，直到摔倒在地，伤了肋骨。我想逃离一切，可我也想要奔向什么。你难道不明白吗，亲爱的，怎么会这样呢？”","The excited woman sat up very straight in her chair and made a quick girlish movement with her hand as she told of the drive alone on the spring afternoon.“It was cloudy and a storm threatened,” she said.“Black clouds made the green of the trees and the grass stand out so that the colors hurt my eyes.I went out Trunion Pike a mile or more and then turned into a side road.The little horse went quickly along up hill and down.I was impatient.Thoughts came and I wanted to get away from my thoughts.I began to beat the horse.The black clouds settled down and it began to rain.I wanted to go at a terrible speed, to drive on and on forever.I wanted to get out of town, out of my clothes, out of my marriage, out of my body, out of everything.I almost killed the horse, making him run, and when he could not run any more I got out of the buggy and ran afoot into the darkness until I fell and hurt my side.I wanted to run away from everything but I wanted to run towards something too.Don’t you see, dear, how it was?”"
"伊丽莎白从椅子上跳起来，在诊所里来回走动。她用一种瑞菲医生从未见过的方式走着。她的身体里仿佛有一个钟摆，那种节奏令他陶醉。当她走过来在他椅子旁边跪倒的时候，他抱住她，开始狂热地亲吻她。“我一路哭着回到家。”她说着，试图继续讲述她那次狂野的驾车之行，可他没有听。“亲爱的！我最亲爱的！哦，我最亲爱的！”他喃喃地说着，觉得自己抱住的不是那个身心疲惫的四十一岁女人，而是一个可爱又纯真的姑娘，那姑娘借助某种奇迹将自己从这个疲惫不堪的女人的躯壳中拉了出来。","Elizabeth sprang out of the chair and began to walk about in the office.She walked as Doctor Reefy thought he had never seen anyone walk before.To her whole body there was a swing, a rhythm that intoxicated him.When she came and knelt on the floor beside his chair he took her into his arms and began to kiss her passionately.“I cried all the way home,” she said, as she tried to continue the story of her wild ride, but he did not listen.“You dear! You lovely dear! Oh you lovely dear!” he muttered and thought he held in his arms not the tired-out woman of forty-one but a lovely and innocent girl who had been able by some miracle to project herself out of the husk of the body of the tired-out woman."
"直到她死后，瑞菲医生才再次见到他曾拥在怀里的这个女人。那个夏日的午后，在诊所里，当他即将成为她的情人的时候，一件几乎是离奇的小插曲立即终结了他的爱情。就在这一男一女紧紧地抱在一起的时候，诊所的楼梯上响起了沉重的脚步声。两个人跳起来，战战兢兢地站在那里听着。楼梯上的响声是一名帕里斯干货公司的伙计发出的。他砰的一声将一个空箱子扔到走廊里的废物堆上，然后再咚咚地下了楼。伊丽莎白几乎立即就跟在他后面下去了。她和她唯一的朋友交谈时在心里复苏的某种东西，突然间死去了。她和瑞菲医生都有些歇斯底里，她不想继续说下去了。她沿着街道走着，身体里的血液仍旧在沸腾。可当她一转过大街，看见新威拉德旅社的灯光时就开始发抖，膝盖抖得如此厉害，以至于有一刹那她以为自己要摔倒在街上了。","Doctor Reefy did not see the woman he had held in his arms again until after her death.On the summer afternoon in the office when he was on the point of becoming her lover a half grotesque little incident brought his love-making quickly to an end.As the man and woman held each other tightly heavy feet came tramping up the office stairs.The two sprang to their feet and stood listening and trembling.The noise on the stairs was made by a clerk from the Paris Dry Goods Company.With a loud bang he threw an empty box on the pile of rubbish in the hallway and then went heavily down the stairs.Elizabeth followed him almost immediately.The thing that had come to life in her as she talked to her one friend died suddenly.She was hysterical, as was also Doctor Reefy, and did not want to continue the talk.Along the street she went with the blood still singing in her body, but when she turned out of Main Street and saw ahead the lights of the New Willard House, she began to tremble and her knees shook so that for a moment she thought she would fall in the street."
"这个女病人在对死亡的渴望中度过了生命中最后的几个月。她在死亡的路上走着，追寻着，渴求着。她把死亡拟人化了，将他时而想象成是一个正在翻越山坡的强壮的黑发年轻人，时而又变成了一个严肃而安静的男子，被生活烙上了印记，弄得满身伤痕。在她房间里，黑暗中，她从被褥里伸出手，觉得死亡就像一个活生生的东西在向她伸出手来。“耐心点儿，爱人。”她低声说，“让自己保持年轻和美丽，有点儿耐心。”","The sick woman spent the last few months of her life hungering for death.Along the road of death she went, seeking, hungering.She personified the figure of death and made him now a strong black-haired youth running over hills, now a stem quiet man marked and scarred by the business of living.In the darkness of her room she put out her hand, thrusting it from under the covers of her bed, and she thought that death like a living thing put out his hand to her.“Be patient, lover,” she whispered.“Keep yourself young and beautiful and be patient.”"
"到了晚上，病痛给了她沉重的一击，她本打算告诉儿子乔治那偷藏的八百美元的计划被击碎了。她下了床，爬过半个房间，向死亡恳求再多一个小时的生命。“等等，亲爱的！我的儿子！我的儿子！我的儿子！”她一边恳求，一边用尽全身的力气去挣脱那曾万分期待的情人的双臂。","On the evening when disease laid its heavy hand upon her and defeated her plans for telling her son George of the eight hundred dollars hidden away, she got out of bed and crept half across the room pleading with death for another hour of life.“Wait, dear! The boy! The boy! The boy!” she pleaded as she tried with all of her strength to fight off the arms of the lover she had wanted so earnestly."
"伊丽莎白死在三月的一天，她的儿子乔治那年十八岁，那个年轻人对她死亡的意义几乎没有感觉。只有时间能教会他这些。他看到她在床上躺了一个月，脸色苍白，一动不动，也不说话。接着，一天下午，医生在走廊里拦住他，跟他说了几句话。","Elizabeth died one day in March in the year when her son George became eighteen, and the young man had but little sense of the meaning of her death.Only time could give him that.For a month he had seen her lying white and still and speechless in her bed, and then one afternoon the doctor stopped him in the hallway and said a few words."
"年轻人走进自己的房间，关上了门。他的腹部区域有一种奇异的空虚感。他坐着盯着地板看了一会，然后跳起来出门去散步。他沿着车站的月台走，然后穿过住宅区的街道，经过高中的教学楼，几乎全都在想着自己的事情。他没有明白死亡的含义，实际上，母亲在那天死去使他有些恼怒。他刚刚收到银行家的女儿海伦·怀特的便条，是答复他的。“今夜我本可以去见她，可现在只能延期了。”他几乎有些恼怒地这样想。","The young man went into his own room and closed the door.He had a queer empty feeling in the region of his stomach.For a moment he sat staring at, the floor and then jumping up went for a walk.Along the station platform he went, and around through residence streets past the high-school building, thinking almost entirely of his own affairs.The notion of death could not get hold of him and he was in fact a little annoyed that his mother had died on that day.He had just received a note from Helen White, the daughter of the town banker, in answer to one from him.“Tonight I could have gone to see her and now it will have to be put off,” he thought half angrily."
"伊丽莎白是在周五下午三点死的。早晨的时候天气很冷，还下着雨，但是下午太阳就出来了。她死前瘫痪着躺了六天，既不能说也不能动，只有思维和眼睛是活着的。这六天中有三天她在挣扎，想到自己的儿子，她试图想就他的将来说几句话。在她眼里出现的那种恳求之情是那样令人为之动容，以至于凡是见过的人在后来的很多年里都还记得这个垂死的女人。即使是一直有些怨恨妻子的汤姆·威拉德也忘记了怨恨。他的泪水涌出眼眶，粘在胡须上。汤姆的胡须已经开始变白，是他自己给染成了黑色。他用来染色的东西里有油，眼泪落在他的胡须上，被他用手擦去，变成了细小的雾状水蒸汽。汤姆·维威拉德悲痛的脸看上去就像一只长时间被丢弃在坏天气里的小狗。","Elizabeth died on a Friday afternoon at three o’clock.It had been cold and rainy in the morning but in the afternoon the sun came out.Before she died she lay paralyzed for six days unable to speak or move and with only her mind and her eyes alive.For three of the six days she struggled, thinking of her boy, trying to say some few words in regard to his future, and in her eyes there was an appeal so touching that all who saw it kept the memory of the dying woman in their minds for years.Even Tom Willard, who had always half resented his wife, forgot his resentment and the tears ran out of his eyes and lodged in his mustache.The mustache had begun to turn grey and Tom colored it with dye.There was oil in the preparation he used for the purpose and the tears, catching in the mustache and being brushed away by his hand, formed a fine mistlike vapor.In his grief Tom Willard’s face looked like the face of a little dog that has been out a long time in bitter weather."
"母亲去世的那天，乔治在夜色中沿着大街走回家。他回到自己的房间，整理了一下头发和服饰后，沿着走廊来到了停放尸体的房间。门边的梳妆台上放着一只蜡烛，瑞菲医生坐在床边的一张椅子上。医生站起来，开始往外走。他伸出手，仿佛在迎接这个年轻人，可接着又尴尬地收了回去。房间里的气氛因为这两个尴尬的人而变得沉重，于是医生很快离开了。","George came home along Main Street at dark on the day of his mother’s death and, after going to his own room to brush his hair and clothes, went along the hallway and into the room where the body lay.There was a candle on the dressing table by the door and Doctor Reefy sat in a chair by the bed.The doctor arose and started to go out.He put out his hand as though to greet the younger man and then awkwardly drew it back again.The air of the room was heavy with the presence of the two self-conscious human beings, and the man hurried away."
"这位已逝妇女的儿子坐在椅子上，看着地板。他又开始想自己的事情，并下定决心要改变自己的生活，离开温斯堡。“我要到某个城市去。或许我能在报社找份工作。”他这么想，接着他转念想到了那个本打算共度今夜的女孩，又有些恼怒这件事使得他无法去见那个女孩。","The dead woman’s son sat down in a chair and looked at the floor.He again thought of his own affairs and definitely decided he would make a change in his life, that he would leave Winesburg.“I will go to some city.Perhaps I can get a job on some newspaper,” he thought, and then his mind turned to the girl with whom he was to have spent this evening and again he was half angry at the turn of events that had prevented his going to her."
"同死去的母亲一同呆在灯光昏暗的房间里，年轻人开始有了一些想法。他在心里品味着有关生命的想法，就像他的母亲曾品味过有关死亡的想法一样。他闭上眼睛，想象着海伦·怀特年轻的红唇碰触到了他自己的双唇。","In the dimly lighted room with the dead woman the young man began to have thoughts.His mind played with thoughts of life as his mother’s mind had played with the thought of death.He closed his eyes and imagined that the red young lips of Helen White touched his own lips."
"他的身体战栗，双手颤抖。接着，事情能够发生了。小伙子跳了起来，僵直地站立着。他看着被单下死去的妇人的遗体，为自己刚刚的想法而羞愧难当，开始呜咽起来。一个新的想法冒了出来，他转身负疚地望了望周围，似乎害怕有人在看他。","His body trembled and his hands shook.And then something happened.The boy sprang to his feet and stood stiffly.He looked at the figure of the dead woman under the sheets and shame for his thoughts swept over him so that he began to weep.A new notion came into his mind and he turned and looked guiltily about as though afraid he would be observed."
"乔治·威拉德生出了一种疯狂的念头，他想要揭开尸体上的被单，看看母亲的脸。这个念头出现在他脑海里，挥之不去。他相信，躺在他面前的床上的不是他的母亲，而是别的什么人。这样的信念太过真实，让他几乎无法忍受。被单下的尸体纤长，因为死亡而显得年轻而优雅。这个小伙子竟然产生了某种奇异的幻想，觉得那尸体不可言喻的美丽。他觉得面前的尸体是活的，在下一秒一个可爱的女子便会从床上跳出来迎接他。这种感觉如此强烈，让他无法承受这种疑虑。他一次次地伸出手。有一次，他摸到了白色的被单，快要把它揭起来了，可他的勇气消失了，他也像瑞菲医生一样转身走出了房间。他停在门外的走廊上，浑身发抖，因此不得不用手扶着墙支撑自己。“那不是我的母亲。躺在那里的不是我的母亲。”他小声地对自己说，身体再次因为害怕和不确定而发起抖来。伊丽莎白·斯威夫特阿姨从旁边的房间里走出来照料尸体。他把手放进她的手中，开始哭泣起来，摇着头，悲恸得几乎失神。“我的妈妈死了。”他说。接着他忘记了面前的女人，转过身，凝视着他刚刚出来的那扇门。“亲爱的，亲爱的，我最亲爱的。”小伙子被外界的某种冲动驱使着，高声叫道。","George Willard became possessed of a madness to lift the sheet from the body of his mother and look at her face.The thought that had come into his mind gripped him terribly.He became convinced that not his mother but someone else lay in the bed before him.The conviction was so real that it was almost unbearable.The body under the sheets was long and in death looked young and graceful.To the boy, held by some strange fancy, it was unspeakably lovely.The feeling that the body before him was alive, that in another moment a lovely woman would spring out of the bed and confront him, became so overpowering that he could not bear the suspense.Again and again he put out his hand.Once he touched and half lifted the white sheet that covered her, but his courage failed and he, like Doctor Reefy, turned and went out of the room.In the hallway outside the door he stopped and trembled so that he had to put a hand against the wall to support himself.“That’s not my mother.That’s not my mother in there,” he whispered to himself and again his body shook with fright and uncertainty.When Aunt Elizabeth Swift, who had come to watch over the body, came out of an adjoining room he put his hand into hers and began to sob, shaking his head from side to side, half blind with grief.“My mother is dead,” he said, and then forgetting the woman he turned and stared at the door through which he had just come.“The dear, the dear, oh the lovely dear,” the boy, urged by some impulse outside himself, muttered aloud."
"至于那八百美元，已逝的母亲藏了那么久是准备给乔治·威拉德到城市用于创业之用的。钱放在那个锡盒里，藏在他母亲床脚旁的石灰墙的后面。伊丽莎白结婚一周后，用一根木棍把墙角的石灰敲掉，将盒子放在那里。然后，她找来一名当时丈夫雇佣的旅社伙计将墙补好。“我猛推床角，撞到了墙。”她向丈夫解释说，那时她还无法放弃想要解脱的梦想。可这样的解脱后来在她的生活中只出现过两次：即她的死神情人和瑞菲医生将她抱在怀中的时候。","As for the eight hundred dollars the dead woman had kept hidden so long and that was to give George Willard his start in the city, it lay in the tin box behind the plaster by the foot of his mother’s bed.Elizabeth had put it there a week after her marriage, breaking the plaster away with a stick.Then she got one of the workmen her husband was at that time employing about the hotel to mend the wall.“I jammed the corner of the bed against it,” she had explained to her husband, unable at the moment to give up her dream of release, the release that after all came to her but twice in her life, in the moments when her lovers Death and Doctor Reefy held her in their arms."
"第二十章 成熟","CHAPTER 20 SOPHISTICATION"
"深秋的一个傍晚，大批的乡下人涌入镇上的温斯堡乡村集市。白天天气晴朗，夜晚温暖宜人。马路从镇上延伸出来，从特鲁连山峰上伸向远方。路两边都是浆果田，而今铺满了枯黄的叶子，来往的马车扬起的灰尘飘在半空中。孩子们蜷成一个个小团，睡在马车上散乱的稻草铺上。他们的头发上满是尘土，手指乌黑黏腻。扬起的尘土飘到田野上，在夕阳下发着彩色的光。","It was early evening of a day in the late fall and the Winesburg County Fair had brought crowds of country people into town.The day had been clear and the night came on warm and pleasant.On the Trunion Pike, where the road after it left town stretched away between berry fields now covered with dry brown leaves, the dust from passing wagons arose in clouds.Children, curled into little balls, slept on the straw scattered on wagon beds.Their hair was full of dust and their fingers black and sticky.The dust rolled away over the fields and the departing sun set it ablaze with colors."
"温斯堡镇的大街上，商店里和人行道上都挤满了人群。夜晚降临，马声嘶鸣，店里面的伙计们疯狂地跑老跑去，孩子们不知所措，使劲大喊大叫。这个美国小镇在纵情欢乐。","In the Main Street of Winesburg crowds filled the stores and the sidewalks.Night came on, horses whinnied, the clerks in the stores ran madly about, children became lost and cried lustily, an American town worked terribly at the task of amusing itself."
"年轻的乔治·威拉德挤过大街上拥挤的人群，躲在通往瑞菲医生诊所的楼梯上，望着往来的人们。他用狂热的目光注视着商店灯光下不断闪现的面孔。各种想法不停地进入他的脑海，可他不想思考。他不耐烦地用脚跺着木制楼梯，敏锐地四处张望。“那么，她会和他呆上一整天吗？我就这么干坐着等吗？”他咕哝着。","Pushing his way through the crowds in Main Street, young George Willard concealed himself in the stairway leading to Doctor Reefy’s office and looked at the people.With feverish eyes he watched the faces drifting past under the store lights.Thoughts kept coming into his head and he did not want to think.He stamped impatiently on the wooden steps and looked sharply about.“Well, is she going to stay with him all day?Have I done all this waiting for nothing?” he muttered."
"乔治·威拉德，这个俄亥俄州的乡下少年，飞快地长成了一个男人，有了新的想法。整整一天，他在集市的人群中走来走去，却觉得很孤独。他打算离开温斯堡到某个城市里去，希望能在城市报社找份工作，他觉得自己已经成年了。这种充斥在他心头的情绪是仅男人才懂，而少年不识的。他觉得自己老了，有些累了。回忆在他心中苏醒。这种新的成熟的感觉使他内心分裂，构成了他近乎悲剧性的人生。他希望有人能理解他在母亲死后心里产生的感觉。","George Willard, the Ohio village boy, was fast growing into manhood and new thoughts had been coming into his mind.All that day, amid the jam of people at the Fair, he had gone about feeling lonely.He was about to leave Winesburg to go away to some city where he hoped to get work on a city newspaper and he felt grown up.The mood that had taken possession of him was a thing known to men and unknown to boys.He felt old and a little tired.Memories awoke in him.To his mind his new sense of maturity set him apart, made of him a half-tragic figure.He wanted someone to understand the feeling that had taken possession of him after his mother’s death."
"每个少年人生中都会有这么一段时期，他生平第一次回顾自己的人生。也许那便是他越过那条界线，成为男人的时刻。这个少年在家乡小镇的街道上漫步。他在思考未来，还有他将在这世界上扮演的角色。他心中涌动着野心和悔恨。突然，发生了一件事；他停在一棵树下等待着，仿佛有人在呼喊他的名字。旧事的阴影爬上了他的心头；身外的声音在低声地述说着生命的有限。他曾一度对自己和未来非常有信心，可是如今又不那么确信了。他若是个充满想象力的少年，便会看到一扇门裂开，他得以第一次探望外面的世界，仿佛能看到无数前人浩浩荡荡地列队从他面前经过。他们来自虚无，进入这个世界，活过了，又消失于虚无之中。成长的悲伤浮上少年的心头。他低低地喘着气，觉得自己不过是一片树叶，被风吹着飘荡在故乡的街头。他知道，无论他的同伴如何言之凿凿，他必定生死无常，就如飘荡在风中的一件东西，或是像谷物一样注定会在太阳下枯萎。他战栗着，急切地四处张望。他生活的这十八年仿佛就是一刹那，是人类征途中呼吸的一瞬。他已经听到死亡在召唤了。他全心全意地想要接近别人，用双手来触摸别人，也被别人触摸。如果让他选，他愿意那是个女人，因为他觉得女人温柔，她也能理解。他最需要的就是理解。","There is a time in the life of every boy when he for the first time takes the backward view of life.Perhaps that is the moment when he crosses the line into manhood.The boy is walking through the street of his town.He is thinking of the future and of the figure he will cut in the world.Ambitions and regrets awake within him.Suddenly something happens; he stops under a tree and waits as for a voice calling his name.Ghosts of old things creep into his consciousness; the voices outside of himself whisper a message concerning the limitations of life.From being quite sure of himself and his future he becomes not at all sure.If he be an imaginative boy a door is torn open and for the first time he looks out upon the world, seeing, as though they marched in procession before him, the countless figures of men who before his time have come out of nothingness into the world, lived their lives and again disappeared into nothingness.The sadness of sophistication has come to the boy.With a little gasp he sees himself as merely a leaf blown by the wind through the streets of his village.He knows that in spite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live and die in uncertainty, a thing blown by the winds, a thing destined like corn to wilt in the sun.He shivers and looks eagerly about.The eighteen years he has lived seem but a moment, a breathing space in the long march of humanity.Already he hears death calling.With all his heart he wants to come close to some other human, touch someone with his hands, be touched by the hand of another.If he prefers that the other be a woman, that is because he believes that a woman will be gentle, that she will understand.He wants, most of all, understanding."
"当乔治·威拉德走向成熟的那一刻，他想到了海伦·怀特，温斯堡镇上银行家的女儿。他总是觉得那个女孩正成长为女人，如同他正成长为一个男子一样。在他十八岁时的一个夏夜，他同她在乡间马路上散步，他一时冲动便开始了吹嘘，为的是想使自己在她眼中看起来成熟伟岸。现在他想见她却是为了另一个目的。他想告诉她涌上自己心头的这些新冲动。在他还不懂什么男子气概的时候，他竭力要使她相信自己是个男子汉。现在，他想同她在一起，好让她感觉到他认为已经在自己身上发生的变化。","When the moment of sophistication came to George Willard his mind turned to Helen White, the Winesburg banker’s daughter.Always he had been conscious of the girl growing into womanhood as he grew into manhood.Once on a summer night when he was eighteen, he had walked with her on a country road and in her presence had given way to an impulse to boast, to make himself appear big and significant in her eyes.Now he wanted to see her for another purpose.He wanted to tell her of the new impulses that had come to him.He had tried to make her think of him as a man when he knew nothing of manhood and now he wanted to be with her and to try to make her feel the change he believed had taken place in his nature."
"对海伦·怀特而言，她也已经到了一个转型期。乔治感受到的东西，她也在以年轻女人的方式感觉着。她不再是个小姑娘，而是渴望获得成熟女子的优雅与美丽。她刚刚从克利夫兰回到家。她在那里上大学，回来是准备去集市上玩一天。她也开始有了回忆。白天，她同一名年轻男子坐在大看台上，那是她母亲的客人，也是她大学里的导师。这位年轻人有些迂腐，她很快感到他不合她意。在集市上，她倒是很乐意被人看到与他结伴，因为他穿着体面，还是个陌生人。她知道他的陪伴会引人注意。白天的时候她很高兴，可当夜晚来临，她就有些坐不住了。她想把那个导师支开，别在她面前出现。当他们一起坐在大看台上，以前的同学将目光停留在他们身上的时候，她对自己男伴的过度关注使他来了兴趣。“学者需要钱。我必须娶个有钱的姑娘。”他暗地想。","As for Helen White, she also had come to a period of change.What George felt, she in her young woman’s way felt also.She was no longer a girl and hungered to reach into the grace and beauty of womanhood.She had come home from Cleveland, where she was attending college, to spend a day at the Fair.She also had begun to have memories.During the day she sat in the grandstand with a young man, one of the instructors from the college, who was a guest of her mother’s.The young man was of a pedantic turn of mind and she felt at once he would not do for her purpose.At the Fair she was glad to be seen in his company as he was well dressed and a stranger.She knew that the fact of his presence would create an impression.During the day she was happy, but when night came on she began to grow restless.She wanted to drive the instructor away, to get out of his presence.While they sat together in the grandstand and while the eyes of former schoolmates were upon them, she paid so much attention to her escort that he grew interested.“A scholar needs money.I should marry a woman with money,” he mused."
"海伦·怀特在想着乔治·威拉德，正如他也闷闷不乐地穿行在拥挤的人群中想着她。她记起他们一起漫步的那个夏夜，很想再同他散一次步。她认为自己在城市里呆了几个月，去剧院看过戏，也看过乌泱泱的人群在灯火辉煌的大道上漫步，她已经改变了很多。她希望他能感觉到并且明白她身上的变化。","Helen White was thinking of George Willard even as he wandered gloomily through the crowds thinking of her.She remembered the summer evening when they had walked together and wanted to walk with him again.She thought that the months she had spent in the city, the going to theaters and the seeing of great crowds wandering in lighted thoroughfares, had changed her profoundly.She wanted him to feel and be conscious of the change in her nature."
"两位年轻男女铭记的那个共度的夏夜，若十分理智地来看的话，是过得非常愚蠢的。他们沿着乡间马路走出镇子。然后他们在一片刚长起来的玉米地的篱笆旁停下，乔治脱掉外套，搭在胳膊上。“嗯，我一直呆在温斯堡——是啊——我还没出过远门，可我正在长大。”他说着，“我一直在阅读，一直在思考。我希望在人生中成就些什么。”","The summer evening together that had left its mark on the memory of both the young man and woman had, when looked at quite sensibly, been rather stupidly spent.They had walked out of town along a country road.Then they had stopped by a fence near a field of young corn and George had taken off his coat and let it hang on his arm.“Well, I’ve stayed here in Winesburg—yes—I’ve not yet gone away but I’m growing up,” he had said.“I’ve been reading books and I’ve been thinking.I’m going to try to amount to something in life."
"“可是，”他解释道，“这不是重点。也许我最好还是别谈这个了。”","“Well,” he explained, “that isn’t the point.Perhaps I’d better quit talking.”"
"困惑的少年把手放在女孩的手臂上。他的声音颤抖。两个人开始沿着马路回小镇。绝望之时，乔治吹嘘道：“我会成为一个大人物，温斯堡里没出过的大人物。”他宣称道，“我希望你做点儿什么，我还不清楚是什么。这或许不关我的事。我希望你能努力和其他的女人不一样。你明白我的意思。我告诉你，这可和我没关系。我希望你成为一个美丽的女人。你明白我要的是什么。”","The confused boy put his hand on the girl’s arm.His voice trembled.The two started to walk back along the road toward town.In his desperation George boasted, “I’m going to be a big man, the biggest that ever lived here in Winesburg,” he declared.“I want you to do something, I don’t know what.Perhaps it is none of my business.I want you to try to be different from other women.You see the point.It’s none of my business I tell you.I want you to be a beautiful woman.You see what I want.”"
"少年的声音低了下去，两个人沉默地回到镇上，沿着街道来到了海伦·怀特的家。","The boy’s voice failed and in silence the two came back into town and went along the street to Helen White's house."
"在门口，他打算说点儿让人印象深刻的话。他之前想出来的长篇大论冒了出来，可它们似乎完全没有意义。“我想——我曾经想——我在心里以为你会嫁给塞思·里士满。现在我知道你不会了。”当她走进大门，朝屋门走去的时候，他总算找到一句话说了。","At the gate he tried to say something impressive.Speeches he had thought out came into his head, but they seemed utterly pointless.“I thought—I used to think—I had it in my mind you would marry Seth Richmond.Now I know you won’t,” was all he could find to say as she went through the gate and toward the door of her house."
"在温暖的秋夜里，乔治站在楼梯口望着大街上川流不息的人群，想到玉米地旁的那次交谈，不禁为自己扮演的角色感到羞愧。街上的人涌来涌去，就像关在牛栏里的牛群。马车和货车几乎塞满了狭窄的主干道。一个乐队在演奏，小孩子们在人行道上追逐，在男人们的腿之间乱钻。红光满面的年轻男子挽着女孩的胳膊，笨拙地走来走去。一家商店楼上的房间里正要举办舞会，提琴手正在调音。断断续续的声音从开着的窗户里飘出来，同嗡嗡的人声，还有乐队喇叭响亮的奏鸣声混在一起。混杂的声音刺激着年轻的威拉德的神经。每个角落、四面八方，生活拥挤、动荡的感觉包围着他。他想要一个人逃离，静静地思考。“要是她想和那个家伙呆在一起，就随她愿吧。我干嘛要在乎？这于我有什么意义呢？”他咕哝了一声，然后沿着大街走去，穿过赫恩的杂货店，来到一条小街上。","On the warm fall evening as he stood in the stairway and looked at the crowd drifting through Main Street, George thought of the talk beside the field of young corn and was ashamed of the figure he had made of himself.In the street the people surged up and down like cattle confined in a pen.Buggies and wagons almost filled the narrow thoroughfare.A band played and small boys raced along the sidewalk, diving between the legs of men.Young men with shining red faces walked awkwardly about with girls on their arms.In a room above one of the stores, where a dance was to be held, the fiddlers tuned their instruments.The broken sounds floated down through an open window and out across the murmur of voices and the loud blare of the horns of the band.The medley of sounds got on young Willard’s nerves.Everywhere, on all sides, the sense of crowding, moving life closed in about him.He wanted to run away by himself and think.“If she wants to stay with that fellow she may.Why should I care?What difference does it make to me?” he growled and went along Main Street and through Hern’s Grocery into a side street."
"乔治觉得十分孤独和沮丧，想要落泪。可是骄傲使他挥动着双臂，迅速地向前走着。他来到韦斯利·莫耶的马车出租行，停在阴影里听一伙人谈论赛马，韦斯利的种马托尼·蒂普赢了下午集市上的比赛。一群人聚在马房前面，韦斯利在人们面前神气地走来走去，吹嘘着。他手里拿着根皮鞭，不断拍打着地面。一团团的尘土在灯光下飞扬。“见鬼，你别再说了。”韦斯利大叫道，“我不怕，我知道我总能把他们打败。我可不怕。”","George felt so utterly lonely and dejected that he wanted to weep but pride made him walk rapidly along, swinging his arms.He came to Wesley Moyer’s livery barn and stopped in the shadows to listen to a group of men who talked of a race Wesley’s stallion, Tony Tip, had won at the Fair during the afternoon.A crowd had gathered in front of the barn and before the crowd walked Wesley, prancing up and down boasting.He held a whip in his hand and kept tapping the ground.Little puffs of dust arose in the lamplight.“Hell, quit your talking,” Wesley exclaimed.“I wasn’t afraid, I knew I had ’em beat all the time.I wasn’t afraid.”"
"平常，乔治·威拉德准会聚精会神地听骑手莫耶吹牛。可现在这让他恼火。他转过身，急忙沿着街道走了。“说大话的老家伙。”他气急败坏地说，“他为什么总想吹牛呢？他干嘛不闭上嘴？”","Ordinarily George Willard would have been intensely interested in the boasting of Moyer, the horseman.Now it made him angry.He turned and hurried away along the street.“Old windbag,” he sputtered.“Why does he want to be bragging?Why don’t he shut up?”"
"乔治来到一片空地，他走得太匆忙了，摔倒在一堆垃圾上。空桶上突出来的一颗钉子撕破了他的裤子。他坐在地上，咒骂着。他用一个别针把破的地方别起来，然后站起来，继续往前走。“我要到海伦·怀特家去找她，我就要这么干。我要照直走进去。我就说想见她。我要走进去，坐下来，就这么办。”他一边说着，一边越过一道篱笆，开始跑起来。","George went into a vacant lot and, as he hurried along, fell over a pile of rubbish.A nail protruding from an empty barrel tore his trousers.He sat down on the ground and swore.With a pin he mended the torn place and then arose and went on.“I’ll go to Helen White’s house, that’s what I’ll do.I’ll walk right in.I’ll say that I want to see her.I’ll walk right in and sit down, that’s what I’ll do,” he declared, climbing over a fence and beginning to run."
"在家里的阳台上，海伦·怀特坐立不安，心烦意乱。那位导师坐在母亲和女儿中间。他的谈话使少女感到厌烦。尽管他也在俄亥俄州的小镇长大，可这位导师却开始摆出一副城市人的派头。他想表现得像个见过世面的人。“我很高兴你给我这个机会，来研究我们学校大多数女士的出身背景。”他说道，“你真是太好了，怀特太太，能邀请我来乡下玩上一天。”他转向海伦，笑起来。“你的生活还是和这个小镇的生活紧密联系着吗？”他问道，“这儿有没有你中意的人呢？”在这女孩听来，他的声音既傲慢又老气横秋。","On the veranda of Banker White’s house Helen was restless and distraught.The instructor sat between the mother and daughter.His talk wearied the girl.Although he had also been raised in an Ohio town, the instructor began to put on the airs of the city.He wanted to appear cosmopolitan.“I like the chance you have given me to study the background out of which most of our girls come,” he declared.“It was good of you, Mrs. White, to have me down for the day.”He turned to Helen and laughed.“Your life is still bound up with the life of this town?” he asked.“There are people here in whom you are interested?”To the girl his voice sounded pompous and heavy."
"海伦站起来，进了屋子。她在通往后花园的门边停了下来，站在那里听着。她的母亲开始说话。“这儿没有一个人配得上和海伦这样有教养的姑娘交往。”她说。","Helen arose and went into the house.At the door leading to a garden at the back she stopped and stood listening.Her mother began to talk.“There is no one here fit to associate with a girl of Helen’s breeding,” she said."
"海伦跑下房子后面的楼梯，进了花园。她在黑暗中停下来，站着全身发抖。在她看来，整个世界都是些无聊的人在说话。怀着炽烈的渴望，她跑出花园的大门，然后在马房旁转了个弯，来到一条小街上。“乔治！你在哪里，乔治？”她喊着，满心紧张和激动。她停下奔跑，靠在一棵树上歇斯底里地大笑起来。乔治·威拉德沿着这条阴暗的小街走出来，口里还在喃喃自语。“我要直接走进她的家。我要直接走进去，坐下来。”他一边说一边向她走来。他停下来，傻乎乎地望着她。“来吧。”他说着，抓起她的手。他们仰着头，沿着街道在树下走着。枯黄的树叶被踩在脚下，沙沙作响。现在乔治已经找到了她，他却不知道怎么做、怎么说才好。","Helen ran down a flight of stairs at the back of the house and into the garden.In the darkness she stopped and stood trembling.It seemed to her that the world was full of meaningless people saying words.Afire with eagerness she ran through a garden gate and, turning a corner by the banker’s barn, went into a little side street.“George! Where are you, George?” she cried, filled with nervous excitement.She stopped running, and leaned against a tree to laugh hysterically.Along the dark little street came George Willard, still saying words.“I’m going to walk right into her house.I’ll go right in and sit down, “ he declared as he came up to her.He stopped and stared stupidly.“Come on,” he said and took hold of her hand.With hanging heads they walked away along the street under the trees.Dry leaves rustled under foot.Now that he had found her George wondered what he had better do and say."
"在温斯堡集市广场的北边，有一个半腐朽的、古旧的大看台。它从没被粉刷过，木板全都弯曲变形了。集市广场坐落在一个从瓦英河谷突出来的小山的山头上。晚上，站在大看台上，越过一片玉米地，人们可以看到小镇的灯光在天幕下熠熠生辉。","At the upper end of the Fair Ground, in Winesburg, there is a half decayed old grandstand.It has never been painted and the boards are all warped out of shape.The Fair Ground stands on top of a low hill rising out of the valley of Wine Creek and from the grandstand one can see at night, over a cornfield, the lights of the town reflected against the sky."
"乔治和海伦从水库池塘边的小路爬上山，来到了集市广场。年轻人站在镇上拥挤的街头时心里涌上的孤独感和孤立感，被海伦的出现给击碎了，可也同时被加强了。他的感受也影响了她。","George and Helen climbed the hill to the Fair Ground, coming by the path past Waterworks Pond.The feeling of loneliness and isolation that had come to the young man in the crowded streets of his town was both broken and intensified by the presence of Helen.What he felt was reflected in her."
"年轻时，人们心中总有两股力量在较量。内心中那个热情、轻率的小动物正在同那个会深思和回忆的小家伙博弈；年龄越大，乔治·威拉德越容易被成熟的东西左右。海伦感受到了他的情绪，满心尊敬地走在他身边。等他们到了大看台，他们爬了上去，在屋顶下面一个长凳样的座椅上坐了下来。","In youth there are always two forces fighting in people.The warm unthinking little animal struggles against the thing that reflects and remembers, and the older, the more sophisticated thing had possession of George Willard.Sensing his mood, Helen walked beside him filled with respect.When they got to the grandstand they climbed up under the roof and sat down on one of the long bench-like seats."
"在一年一度的集市结束后的夜里，走进这样一个中西部小镇边上的集市广场，总会有些难以忘怀的经历。那种感触是让人永难忘怀的。四面八方都是憧憧的影子，并非是魂灵，而是人影。在这里，在刚刚过去的白天里，人们从镇上和周围的乡村涌过来。携家带口的农夫，成百上千来自小木板房的居民，都聚集在这些木板墙里面。年轻的姑娘们大笑着，留着胡子的男人们谈论着他们的生活琐事。整个地方洋溢着生活的气息。生活曾在这里渴望过，蠢蠢欲动，可现在夜幕降临，一切都消失了。这沉默几乎令人觉得害怕。当一个人沉默地隐藏在树干旁，天性中深思的倾向会增强。而此刻，若思及生活的无意义，一个人会不寒而栗，而若是镇上的人都是他的乡亲，他便会因对生活强烈的爱而热泪盈眶。","There is something memorable in the experience to be had by going into a fair ground that stands at the edge of a Middle Western town on a night after the annual fair has been held.The sensation is one never to be forgotten.On all sides are ghosts, not of the dead, but of living people.Here, during the day just passed, have come the people pouring in from the town and the country around.Farmers with their wives and children and all the people from the hundreds of little frame houses have gathered within these board walls.Young girls have laughed and men with beards have talked of the affairs of their lives.The place has been filled to overflowing with life.It has itched and squirmed with life and now it is night and the life has all gone away.The silence is almost terrifying.One conceals oneself standing silently beside the trunk of a tree and what there is of a reflective tendency in his nature is intensified.One shudders at the thought of the meaninglessness of life while at the same instant, and if the people of the town are his people, one loves life so intensely that tears come into the eyes."
"在大看台屋顶下的黑暗中，乔治·威拉德坐在海伦·怀特旁边，敏锐地感到在这个生存体制中自己的渺小。小镇里人们四处奔波、忙忙碌碌，令人心情烦躁。现在他出了镇，这种烦闷便一扫而光。海伦的陪伴令他精神焕发、神清气爽。仿佛是因为她用那只女人的手帮他将生活的机器微微调整了一下。他开始带着近乎敬畏的心情去看待同他一起生活的小镇居民。他也对海伦肃然起敬。他想要爱她，也希望被她所爱，但是，他不想在此刻被她的女性气质所迷惑。他在黑暗中握住她的手，并在她悄悄靠近的时候伸手搂住了她的肩膀。一阵风起，他打了个冷战。他用尽全力试图保持镇定，弄懂自己此刻的心情。在这个黑暗的高处，这两个异常敏感的人类分子紧紧地互相拥抱，等待着。他们的心里有着同样的想法。“我来到了这个孤单的地方，而这里还有另一个人。”这便是他们感受到的实质。","In the darkness under the roof of the grandstand, George Willard sat beside Helen White and felt very keenly his own insignificance in the scheme of existence.Now that he had come out of town where the presence of the people stirring about, busy with a multitude of affairs, had been so irritating, the irritation was all gone.The presence of Helen renewed and refreshed him.It was as though her woman’s hand was assisting him to make some minute readjustment of the machinery of his life.He began to think of the people in the town where he had always lived with something like reverence.He had reverence for Helen.He wanted to love and to be loved by her, but he did not want at the moment to be confused by her womanhood.In the darkness he took hold of her hand and when she crept close put a hand on her shoulder.A wind began to blow and he shivered.With all his strength he tried to hold and to understand the mood that had come upon him.In that high place in the darkness the two oddly sensitive human atoms held each other tightly and waited.In the mind of each was the same thought.“I have come to this lonely place and here is this other,” was the substance of the thing felt."
"在温斯堡，熙熙攘攘的白天已经结束，深秋的漫长黑夜开始了。农场的马匹拖着各自疲惫的主人，沿着寂静的乡间马路缓缓而去。伙计们开始把人行道上的货物样品拿进去，并锁上店门。在歌剧院里，一群人聚在那里等着看表演；沿着大街再往前，小提琴手调好了弦，大汗淋漓地演奏着，让年轻的舞步在舞池里不停旋转。","In Winesburg the crowded day had run itself out into the long night of the late fall.Farm horses jogged away along lonely country roads pulling their portion of weary people.Clerks began to bring samples of goods in off the sidewalks and lock the doors of stores.In the Opera House a crowd had gathered to see a show and further down Main Street the fiddlers, their instruments tuned, sweated and worked to keep the feet of youth flying over a dance floor."
"大看台上的海伦·怀特和乔治·威拉德仍然在黑暗中沉默着。将他们绑在一起的那股魔咒时不时地被打破。他们转过身，竭力在昏暗的灯光中望见彼此的眼睛。他们接吻，可这股激情并不持久。在集市广场的北边，六名男子在检查下午参加了比赛的马匹。他们生了一堆火，用水壶在烧水。在火光中只能看见他们走来走去的腿。起风的时候，微弱的火焰被吹得疯狂地跳动。","In the darkness in the grandstand Helen White and George Willard remained silent.Now and then the spell that held them was broken and they turned and tried in the dim light to see into each other’s eyes.They kissed but that impulse did not last.At the upper end of the Fair Ground a half dozen men worked over horses that had raced during the afternoon.The men had built a fire and were heating kettles of water.Only their legs could be seen as they passed back and forth in the light.When the wind blew the little flames of the fire danced crazily about."
"乔治和海伦站起来，走向黑暗。他们沿着一条小径经过一片尚未收割的玉米地。风在干枯的玉米叶子间呼啸着。在他们走回镇的路上，将他们绑在一起的魔咒一度被打破。他们来到水库山的山顶，停在一棵树旁边，乔治再次把手放在女孩的肩膀上。她热情地拥抱他，接着他们又再次迅速地从那种冲动中清醒过来。他们停止接吻，往边上站开一点儿。他们更加尊重彼此了。他们都感到尴尬，为了缓解这种窘迫情绪，他们便顺从了年轻的兽性。他们大笑起来，开始互相拉拉扯扯。在某种意义上，他们被自己正处于的这种情绪修正并净化，变得既不是男人和女人，也不是少年和少女，而是兴奋的小动物。","George and Helen arose and walked away into the darkness.They went along a path past a field of corn that had not yet been cut.The wind whispered among the dry corn blades.For a moment during the walk back into town the spell that held them was broken.When they had come to the crest of Waterworks Hill they stopped by a tree and George again put his hands on the girl’s shoulders.She embraced him eagerly and then again they drew quickly back from that impulse.They stopped kissing and stood a little apart.Mutual respect grew big in them.They were both embarrassed and to relieve their embarrassment dropped into the animalism of youth.They laughed and began to pull and haul at each other.In some way chastened and purified by the mood they had been in, they became, not man and woman, not boy and girl, but excited little animals."
"他们就这样走下山坡。黑暗中，他们像两只年轻漂亮的小动物在年轻的世界里嬉戏。一次，在往前猛冲的时候，海伦把乔治绊倒了。他扭动着大叫起来。他笑得全身发抖，滚下山去了。海伦追赶着他。她在黑暗里稍停了一会儿。她的脑子里闪过了什么样的女性思想无从得知。但等到达山脚下，她就朝少年走过去，拉住他的手臂，在庄严的沉默中走在他的身边。由于某种原因，他们都无法解释，为何他们都从那个共同度过的沉默夜晚里得到了所需要的东西。","It was so they went down the hill.In the darkness they played like two splendid young things in a young world.Once, running swiftly forward, Helen tripped George and he fell.He squirmed and shouted.Shaking with laughter, he rolled down the hill.Helen ran after him.For just a moment she stopped in the darkness.There was no way of knowing what woman’s thoughts went through her mind but, when the bottom of the hill was reached and she came up to the boy, she took his arm and walked beside him in dignified silence.For some reason they could not have explained they had both got from their silent evening together the thing needed."
"男人或是男孩，女人或是女孩，他们都曾片刻间抓住过这种能使男人和女人有可能在现代世界里过上成熟生活的东西。","Man or boy, woman or girl, they had for a moment taken hold of the thing that makes the mature life of men and women in the modern world possible."
"第二十一章 离乡","CHAPTER 21 DEPARTURE"
"年轻的乔治·威拉德清晨四点就起了床。正值四月，幼嫩的树叶正从苞芽中抽出。温斯堡住宅区街道两旁都是枫树，种子四处飘散。起风的时候，种子便随着风疯狂地打转，飞散在空中，然后落在地上，变成了脚下的地毯。","Young George Willard got out of bed at four in the morning.It was April and the young tree leaves were just coming out of their buds.The trees along the residence streets in Winesburg are maple and the seeds are winged.When the wind blows they whirl crazily about, filling the air and making a carpet underfoot."
"乔治拿着一个棕色的皮包，下楼来到旅社办公室。出发的行李已经收拾妥当。他从两点钟醒来就一直在思考这次将要进行的旅行，想知道在旅程的尽头他会发现些什么。睡在旅社办公室里的小伙子躺在靠门边的一张简易床上。他张着嘴，鼾声如雷。乔治悄悄地越过那张床，走出旅社，来到寂静无人的大街上。东方曙光初现，一条条长长的光带爬上天空，只剩几颗星星仍在闪烁。","George came downstairs into the hotel office carrying a brown leather bag.His trunk was packed for departure.Since two o’clock he had been awake thinking of the journey he was about to take and wondering what he would find at the end of his journey.The boy who slept in the hotel office lay on a cot by the door.His mouth was open and he snored lustily.George crept past the cot and went out into the silent deserted main street.The east was pink with the dawn and long streaks of light climbed into the sky where a few stars still shone."
"越过特鲁连山峰上的最后一座房子，有一大块开阔的田野。田野的所有者是住在镇上的农夫，他们在傍晚驾着咯吱作响的轻便马车，顺着特鲁连山往家里赶。田野里种着各种浆果和小型水果。炎热的夏季午后，马路上和田野里都覆盖着尘土，一层烟雾笼罩着这一大片平坦的盆地。眺望这片田野就像是在眺望大海。春季的时候，大地一片葱绿，景象又不尽相同。土地变成一大块绿色的台球桌面，微型的人形小昆虫在其间耕耘劳作。","Beyond the last house on Trunion Pike in Winesburg there is a great stretch of open fields.The fields are owned by farmers who live in town and drive homeward at evening along Trunion Pike in light creaking wagons.In the fields are planted berries and small fruits.In the late afternoon in the hot summers when the road and the fields are covered with dust, a smoky haze lies over the great flat basin of land.To look across it is like looking out across the sea.In the spring when the land is green the effect is somewhat different.The land becomes a wide green billiard table on which tiny human insects toil up and down."
"乔治·威拉德的整个少年和青年期都有在特鲁连山峰散步的习惯。他曾经在冬夜到过这片巨大的空地，那时候地面白雪皑皑，只有月亮照在他身上；他也曾在秋天来过，萧瑟的秋风吹拂着；而在夏夜，空气因虫鸣而微微颤动。他想在四月的清晨再去一次，再静静地散一次步。他的确步行到了小镇两英里外，那里的马路被一条小溪淹没了。然后，他转身再默默地走回来。当他回到大街时，伙计们正在店门前清扫人行道。“嘿，乔治。要出远门感觉如何啊？”他们问道。","All through his boyhood and young manhood George Willard had been in the habit of walking on Trunion Pike.He had been in the midst of the great open place on winter nights when it was covered with snow and only the moon looked down at him; he had been there in the fall when bleak winds blew and on summer evenings when the air vibrated with the song of insects.On the April morning he wanted to go there again, to walk again in the silence.He did walk to where the road dipped down by a little stream two miles from town and then turned and walked silently back again.When he got to Main Street clerks were sweeping the sidewalks before the stores.“Hey, you George.How does it feel to be going away?” they asked."
"西行的火车将于早上七点四十五分从温斯堡驶出。汤姆·利特尔是列车员。他的火车从克利夫兰发出，行驶到与主干线相接的地方，线路的终点是芝加哥和纽约。汤姆负责的这段行程被铁路圈的人称作“轻松行”。每天晚上他都回家。秋天和春天的时候，他就在礼拜天到伊利湖去钓鱼。他有着红润的圆脸和蓝色的小眼睛。他对铁路沿线上的小镇居民的熟悉程度，可比一个城市人对他同住一栋公寓楼的人的了解程度要强多了。","The westbound train leaves Winesburg at seven forty-five in the morning.Tom Little is conductor.His train runs from Cleveland to where it connects with a great trunk line railroad with terminals in Chicago and New York.Tom has what in railroad circles is called an “easy run.”Every evening he returns to his family.In the fall and spring he spends his Sundays fishing in Lake Erie.He has a round red face and small blue eyes.He knows the people in the towns along his railroad better than a city man knows the people who live in his apartment building."
"乔治在七点钟的时候从新威拉德旅社出来，走下小斜坡。汤姆·威拉德拿着他的包。儿子已经长得比父亲还要高些。","George came down the little incline from the New Willard House at seven o’clock.Tom Willard carried his bag.The son had become taller than the father."
"在站台上，每个人都同这个年轻人握手。还有十几个人等在旁边。他们聊着自己的事情。就连懒惰的常常每天睡到九点的威尔·亨德森也起来了。乔治很窘迫。在温斯堡邮局工作的格特鲁德·威尔莫特，一位瘦高的五十岁女人，也沿着站台走了过来。她之前从没留意过乔治。可现在，她停下来，伸出手。她用两个词就说出了每个人的感受。“祝你好运。”她简单地说，然后转身走了。","On the station platform everyone shook the young man’s hand.More than a dozen people waited about.Then they talked of their own affairs.Even Will Henderson, who was lazy and often slept until nine, had got out of bed.George was embarrassed.Gertrude Wilmot, a tall thin woman of fifty who worked in the Winesburg post office, came along the station platform.She had never before paid any attention to George.Now she stopped and put out her hand.In two words she voiced what everyone felt.“Good luck,” she said sharply and then turning went on her way."
"火车进站的时候，乔治终于感到解脱了。他急忙跳上了车。海伦·怀特沿着大街跑过来，希望和他道个别，可他已经找到位置坐下了，没有看到她。火车开动的时候，汤姆·利特尔来检票，冲他咧嘴笑。尽管他很了解乔治，也知道他此次出发是为了什么冒险，他却不发表任何意见。汤姆已经见过无数个乔治·威拉德这样的年轻人离开他们的小镇，前往城市。对他而言，这是再普通不过的一件事情。在吸烟车厢，有个人刚刚邀请了汤姆到桑达斯基湾去钓鱼。他想接受这份邀请，再谈谈细节问题。","When the train came into the station George felt relieved.He scampered hurriedly aboard.Helen White came running along Main Street hoping to have a parting word with him, but he had found a seat and did not see her.When the train started Tom Little punched his ticket, grinned and, although he knew George well and knew on what adventure he was just setting out, made no comment.Tom had seen a thousand George Willards go out of their towns to the city.It was a commonplace enough incident with him.In the smoking car there was a man who had just invited Tom to go on a fishing trip to Sandusky Bay.He wanted to accept the invitation and talk over details."
"乔治上下打量了一下这节车厢，确定没有人注意他后，便拿出钱包来开始数钱。他满脑子想着不要表现得像个新手。他的父亲所说的最后几句话几乎都是关于他到城市后的行为举止问题。“放机灵点儿。”汤姆·威拉德说，“看好自己的钱。警觉点。这是车票。别让人觉得你什么都不懂。”","George glanced up and down the car to be sure no one was looking, then took out his pocketbook and counted his money.His mind was occupied with a desire not to appear green.Almost the last words his father had said to him concerned the matter of his behavior when he got to the city.“Be a sharp one,” Tom Willard had said.“Keep your eyes on your money.Be awake.That’s the ticket.Don’t let anyone think you’re a greenhorn.”"
"乔治数完钱之后，就望着窗外，惊奇地发现火车仍然还在温斯堡。","After George counted his money he looked out of the window and was surprised to see that the train was still in Winesburg."
"这个离开故土去冒险闯荡的年轻人开始思考，可他并没有思考什么十分重大或是戏剧性的事件。诸如母亲的死，他离开温斯堡，他在城市中的未知的生活，这些生活中的严肃面和重大面还没有进入他的思想。","The young man, going out of his town to meet the adventure of life, began to think but he did not think of anything very big or dramatic.Things like his mother’s death, his departure from Winesburg, the uncertainty of his future life in the city, the serious and larger aspects of his life did not come into his mind."
"他反而想到许多的小事——特克·斯莫利特在清晨推着木板车穿过镇上的大街；一个高个子、穿着美丽睡袍的女人，曾有一次在父亲的旅社里呆了一整夜；温斯堡的点灯人布奇·惠勒拿着手电筒，在一个夏夜里急忙穿过街道；海伦·怀特站在温斯堡的邮局窗户边，往一个信封上贴邮票。","He thought of little things—Turk Smollet wheeling boards through the main street of his town in the morning, a tall woman, beautifully gowned, who had once stayed overnight at his father’s hotel, Butch Wheeler the lamp lighter of Winesburg hurrying through the streets on a summer evening and holding a torch in his hand, Helen White standing by a window in the Winesburg post office and putting a stamp on an envelope."
"对梦想的高涨的热情占据了这个年轻人的心。看着他，没人会觉得他特别机灵。他在脑海里一边回忆着各种小事情，一边闭上眼睛向后靠在车座上。他就这样呆了很长的一段时间。当他醒过来再次望向车窗外时，温斯堡镇已经消失，他在那里的生活也已经成为了一个背景色。在这个背景色上，他将描绘自己成年时期的梦想。","The young man’s mind was carried away by his growing passion for dreams.One looking at him would not have thought him particularly sharp.With the recollection of little things occupying his mind he closed his eyes and leaned back in the car seat.He stayed that way for a long time and when he aroused himself and again looked out of the car window the town of Winesburg had disappeared and his life there had become but a background on which to paint the dreams of his manhood."
"终结","End."
