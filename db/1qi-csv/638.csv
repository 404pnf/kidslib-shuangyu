"最后一案","The Final Problem"
"怀着十分沉痛的心情，我最后一次提笔叙写我朋友歇洛克·福尔摩斯，叙写他秀出群伦的独特本领。在此之前，我以一种杂乱无章、自己也深感十分苍白的方式讲述了我与他共同经历的一些离奇事件，始于我俩借由“暗红习作”一案初次相识，迄于他介入“海军协定”一案。在后面这件案子当中，毫无疑问，多亏有他的介入，一场严重的国际纠纷才没有成为事实。我本打算就此封笔，绝口不提下面这件事情，因为这件事情给我的生活造成了难以承受的缺憾，事隔两年也没有丝毫好转。可是，詹姆斯·莫里亚蒂上校最近发表了一些信件，试图为他已故的兄弟正名，所以我已经别无选择，只能遽尔操觚，把相关的事实原原本本地呈现在公众眼前。世上只有我一个人了解这件事情的全部真相，而我已经断定，事到如今，秘而不宣不会再有任何好处。据我所知，关于此事的公开报道只有三种，一是《日内瓦日报》[^1]一八九一年五月六日的报道，二是英国各家报纸五月七日刊发的路透社电讯，再就是我前面提到的那些新近发表的公开信。前两种都是语焉不详，后一种则正如我即将揭示的那样，完全是颠倒黑白。有鉴于此，我自感义不容辞，不得不首次披露，莫里亚蒂教授和歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生二人纠葛的真实始末。","It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished. In an incoherent and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion, I have endeavoured to give some account of my strange experiences in his company from the chance which first brought us together at the period of the ‘Study in Scarlet,’ up to the time of his interference in the matter of the “Naval Treaty”—an interference which had the unquestionable effect of preventing a serious international complication. It was my intention to have stopped there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill. My hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother, and I have no choice but to lay the facts before the public exactly as they occurred. I alone know the absolute truth of the matter, and I am satisfied that the time has come when no good purpose is to be served by its suppression. As far as I know, there have been only three accounts in the public press: that in the *Journal de Genève* on May 6th, 1891, the Reuter’s dispatch in the English papers on May 7th, and finally the recent letters to which I have alluded. Of these the first and second were extremely condensed, while the last is, as I shall now show, an absolute perversion of the facts. It lies with me to tell for the first time what really took place between Professor Moriarty and Mr. Sherlock Holmes."
"读者诸君也许记得，自从我有了家室，随后又开业行医，我和福尔摩斯之间的亲密关系就在一定程度上有所疏远。隔三岔五，赶上他的调查工作需要同伴的时候，他依然会来找我，然而，这样的情形日见稀少，最后我竟然发现，我一八九零年的记录当中只有区区三件案子。这一年的冬天和一八九一年的初春，我在报上看到他接受了法国政府的委托，正在办一件极其重大的案子，其间又收到了他分别从纳博讷和尼姆[^2]寄来的两封信，由此推测他的法国之行可能会旷日持久。这样一来，四月二十四日晚上，看到他走进我的诊疗室，我不免觉得有些惊讶。与此同时，我发现他脸色比平常还要苍白，身形也更见消瘦。","It may be remembered that after my marriage, and my subsequent start in private practice, the very intimate relations which had existed between Holmes and myself became to some extent modified. He still came to me from time to time when he desired a companion in his  investigations, but these occasions grew more and more seldom, until I find that in the year 1890 there were only three cases of which I retain any record. During the winter of that year and the early spring of 1891, I saw in the papers that he had been engaged by the French government upon a matter of supreme importance, and I received two notes from Holmes, dated from Narbonne and from Nimes, from which I gathered that his stay in France was likely to be a long one. It was with some surprise, therefore, that I saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the evening of April 24th. It struck me that he was looking even paler and thinner than usual."
"“是啊，我的确把自己消耗得太厉害了，”他回答的是我的表情，并没有等我开口说话，“最近的压力稍微有点儿沉重。我得把你的窗板关上，你没意见吧？”","“Yes, I have been using myself up rather too freely,” he remarked, in answer to my look rather than to my words; “I have been a little pressed of late. Have you any objection to my closing your shutters?”"
"我本来是在看书，桌上的提灯是屋里仅有的光源。福尔摩斯贴着墙蹭到窗边，砰的一声关上窗板，跟着就紧紧地插上了插销。","The only light in the room came from the lamp upon the table at which I had been reading. Holmes edged his way round the wall, and, flinging the shutters together, he bolted them securely."
"“你是在害怕某种东西吗？”我问道。","“You are afraid of something?” I asked."
"“呃，是的。”","“Well, I am.”"
"“什么东西呢？”","“Of what?”"
"“气枪[^3]。”","“Of air-guns.”"
"“亲爱的福尔摩斯，这话是什么意思？”","“My dear Holmes, what do you mean?”"
"“你对我非常了解，华生，应该知道我绝不是一个神经过敏的人。话又说回来，如果危险临头还拒绝承认，那就不叫勇敢，只能叫做愚蠢了。你能给我根火柴吗？”他贪婪地吸着香烟，似乎是非常享受它的镇静作用。","“I think that you know me well enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means a nervous man. At the same time, it is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognize danger when it is close upon you. Might I trouble you for a match?” He drew in the smoke of his cigarette as if the soothing influence was grateful to him."
"“这么晚上门，我得跟你道个歉，”他说道，“不光如此，一会儿我还得从你们家后园的墙头翻出去，请你不要见怪。”","“I must apologize for calling so late,” said he, “and I must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall."""
"“可是，这一切到底是怎么回事呢？”我问道。于是他伸出一只手来，而我借着提灯的光线看见，他有两个指关节已经破皮见血。","“But what does it all mean?” I asked. He held out his hand, and I saw in the light of the lamp that two of his knuckles were burst and bleeding."
"“看见了吧，这可不是虚无缥缈的事情，”他笑着说道。“恰恰相反，这事情铁板钉钉，打上去都会伤到手呢。你太太在吗？”","“It’s not an airy nothing, you see,” said he, smiling. “On the contrary, it is solid enough for a man to break his hand over. Is Mrs. Watson in?”"
"“她出门作客去了。”","“She is away upon a visit.”"
"“真的啊！你一个人吗？”","“Indeed! you are alone?”"
"“没错。”","“Quite.”"
"“这样的话，事情就好办了。我打算请你跟我一起上欧洲大陆去待一周，本来还有点儿不好开口呢。” ","“Then it makes it the easier for me to propose that you should come away with me for a week to the Continent.”"
"“去哪儿？”","“Where?”"
"“噢，哪儿都行，对我来说都一样。”","“Oh, anywhere. It’s all the same to me.”"
"眼前的一切实在是非常古怪。福尔摩斯可不是一个喜欢没事闲逛的人，更何况，他苍白憔悴的脸庞已经告诉了我，他的神经正处于最为紧张的状态。他看到了我眼睛里的疑问，于是就把双手叉在一起，双肘支在膝头，开始解释其中的缘由。","There was something very strange in all this. It was not Holmes’s nature to take an aimless holiday, and something about his pale, worn face told me that his nerves were at their highest tension. He saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips together and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation."
"“莫里亚蒂教授这个人，你多半是从来没听说过吧？”他说道。“没听说过。”","“You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?” said he."
"“可不是嘛，高就高在这里，妙就妙在这里！”他大声说道。","“Never.”"
"“他的势力遍及伦敦的每一个角落，他的名字却从来不曾有人提起。他之所以能够登上犯罪史的巅峰，原因就在这里。实实在在地告诉你，华生，如果能够击败这个家伙，能够为社会清除这个祸害，我就会觉得自己的职业生涯已经达到顶峰，往后就可以去过一种比较平静的生活。咱俩私下说啊，最近这段时间，替斯堪的纳维亚王室和法国公众办完那几件案子之后，我已经打下了一点儿基础，可以去过我最喜欢的那种隐居生活，集中精力搞我的化学研究。可是，华生，一想到莫里亚蒂教授这样的人还在伦敦的大街上横行无忌，我就没办法踏实下来，没办法安安稳稳地坐在自个儿的椅子上。 ”","“Ay, there’s the genius and the wonder of the thing!” he cried. “The man pervades London, and no one has heard of him. That’s what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime. I tell you Watson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if I could free society of him, I should feel that my own career had reached its summit, and I should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life. Between ourselves, the recent cases in which I have been of assistance to the royal family of Scandinavia, and to the French republic, have left me in such a position that I could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical researches. But I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty were walking the streets of London unchallenged.”"
"“那么，他都干了些什么呢？”","“What has he done, then?”"
"“这个人的履历可谓不同凡响。他出身名门，受过非常好的教育，还拥有惊人的数学天赋。刚刚二十一岁的时候，他就完成了一篇关于二项式定理的论文，一时间名噪全欧。靠着论文带来的声誉，他在本国一所不那么显赫的大学里获得了数学教席，从各个方面来看都是前程似锦。可是，这家伙拥有邪恶至极的遗传天性，血管里流的也是罪犯的血液，而他非凡的智力不但没有起到矫正的作用，反而助长了他的犯罪倾向，使他的犯罪行为变本加厉。这么着，他从教的那个校园小镇渐渐有了一些关于他的恐怖传言，而他也不得不辞去教授职位，来到伦敦，摇身变成了一名陆军教官。外界对他的了解到此为止，接下来的这些事情都是我自己的发现。","“His career has been an extraordinary one. He is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise upon the binomial theorem, which has had a European vogue. On the strength of it he won the mathematical chair at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all appearances, a most brilliant career before him. But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. Dark rumours gathered round him in the university town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and to come down to London, where he set up as an army coach. So much is known to the world, but what I am telling you now is what I have myself discovered."
"“你是知道的，华生，关于伦敦高层犯罪圈子的内幕，这世上再没有谁比我更清楚。多年以来，我一直觉得伦敦罪犯的背后有一股组织完备、深藏不露的势力，这股势力一直在阻碍法律的实施，一直在为不法之徒提供庇护。一次又一次，我不断地通过五花八门的罪案——伪造、劫盗、谋杀——察觉到这股势力的存在，还从我未曾亲身参与的许多悬案当中嗅到了它的气息。多年以来，我一直在努力揭开它的神秘面幂，最后才终于找到线索，开始顺藤摸瓜。千百次扑朔迷离的转折之后，这条线索终于让我追踪到了曾经的数学名流，现已退职的莫里亚蒂教授。","“As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do. For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organizing power which forever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over the wrong-doer. Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts—forgery cases, robberies, murders—I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted. For years I have endeavoured to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when I seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-Professor Moriarty, of mathematical celebrity."
"“他就是罪犯之中的拿破仑，华生。他是咱们这座伟大城市里半数罪案的主谋，那些未能破获的悬案几乎都是出自他的筹划。他是个天才，又是个哲人，还是个超凡脱俗的思想者。他拥有第一流的头脑，总是像蜘蛛一样端坐在网子的中央，可怕的是，他那张网包括千万条丝线，每一条丝线的每一丝颤抖他都是了如指掌。他很少亲自动手，只负责制订计划，可他的爪牙不光是不计其数，而且拥有十分完备的组织。如果有人想实施什么罪行，打个比方说吧，想盗窃某份文件，想抢劫某座房屋，或者是想清除某个人，只需要给教授捎个话，事情就会安排妥当、水到渠成。爪牙可能会落入法网，但却总会有人出钱来保他们，或者是替他们打官司。与此同时，操纵这些爪牙的中枢从来都不曾被人逮到，甚至是从来不曾惹上嫌疑。这就是我追查出来的那个组织，华生，也是我用尽全力去揭露并摧毁的目标。","“He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans. But his agents are numerous and splendidly organized. Is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed—the word is passed to the professor, the matter is organized and carried out. The agent may be caught. In that case money is found for his bail or his defence. But the central power which uses the agent is never caught—never so much as suspected. This was the organization which I deduced, Watson, and which I devoted my whole energy to exposing and breaking up."
"“可是，教授在自己周围设下了一道道精心构筑的屏障，即便我使尽浑身解数，一时之间也不免灰心丧气，觉得我根本拿不到足以将他按律定罪的证据。我的本领你是知道的，亲爱的华生，可是，整整三个月的追查之后，我不得不承认，我终于遇上了一个智力和我不相上下的对手。那时候，我对他的本事无比钦佩，甚至超过了我对他那些罪行的憎恨之情。不过，他最终还是犯了个错误。当然，那只是一个非常非常小的错误，可是，既然有我在他身后穷追不舍，错误的代价就不是他所能承受。就从他犯错的那一刻开始，我见机而作，一步步地在他周围布下了天罗地网，眼下已经是万事俱备，只待收网见鱼。三天之后，换句话说就是下周一，时机就会成熟，教授和他那个帮派里所有的得力干将都会落入警方的掌握。随之而来的就会是本世纪最大的一次刑事审判，四十多宗疑案将会同时破解，所有案犯也都会摊上一根绞索。不过，你明白吧，我们绝不能过早地采取任何行动，那样的话，即便已经到了最后的关头，他们仍然有可能溜出我们的掌心。","“But the professor was fenced round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do what I would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which would convict in a court of law. You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal. My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill. But at last he made a trip—only a little, little trip—but it was more than he could afford, when I was so close upon him. I had my chance, and, starting from that point, I have woven my net round him until now it is all ready to close. In three days—that is to say, on Monday next—matters will be ripe, and the professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police. Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and the rope for all of them; but if we move at all prematurely, you understand, they may slip out of our hands even at the last moment."
"“好了，如果我这些安排能够瞒过莫里亚蒂教授的话，所有事情当然会顺利完成。只可惜他老谋深算，不可能对此无知无觉。他看到了我那张网的每一条经纬，一次又一次地想要破网而逃，而我也一次又一次地截住了他。这么跟你说吧，我的朋友，我和他之间那场沉默的较量如果能有一份详尽的记述，一定会成为侦探史上最精彩的一篇智斗经典。以前我从来不曾到达如此超绝的高度，也从来不曾被对手逼得如此窘迫。他确实是深谋远虑，可我刚好比他稍微高了那么一筹。今天早上，我做好了最后的部署，只需要三天的时间，整件事情就可以大功告成。接下来，我坐在自己的房间里掂量这件事情，房门突然开了，莫里亚蒂教授站在了我的眼前。","“Now, if I could have done this without the knowledge of Professor Moriarty, all would have been well. But he was too wily for that. He saw every step which I took to draw my toils round him. Again and again he strove to break away, but I as often headed him off. I tell you, my friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest could be written, it would take its place as the most brilliant bit of thrust-and-parry work in the history of detection. Never have I risen to such a height, and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent. He cut deep, and yet I just undercut him. This morning the last steps were taken, and three days only were wanted to complete the business. I was sitting in my room thinking the matter over when the door opened and Professor Moriarty stood before me."
"“我的神经算得上相当坚强，华生，可我必须承认，看到我日夜琢磨的那个人突然站在了我的家门口，我还是吓了一跳。他的长相我早已了如指掌，个子高得出奇，身材瘦得出奇，突出的额头形成了一个白色的弧面，眼睛深深地陷进了头颅。他苍白的脸庞刮得干干净净，样子有点儿像苦行的僧侣，眉目之间还依稀保留着教授的风范。他的肩膀因为长年的研究工作而变得有些佝偻，伸在身前的脸则不停地左摇右摆，摆动的速度十分缓慢，方式也十分古怪，活像是一只爬行动物。进门之后，他眯缝起眼睛，饶有兴致地打量着我。","“My nerves are fairly proof, Watson, but I must confess to a start when I saw the very man who had been so much in my thoughts standing there on my threshold. His appearance was quite familiar to me. He is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in his head. He is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of the professor in his features. His shoulders are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward and is forever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion. He peered at me with great curiosity in his puckered eyes."
"“‘您的额头也没有我想的那么高嘛，’良久之后，他终于开了口。‘把手伸在睡袍口袋里拨弄上了膛的火器，这可是一种危险的习惯哪。’","“‘You have less frontal development than I should have expected,’ said he at last. ‘It is a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one’s dressing-gown.’"
"“的确，他刚刚跨进门槛，我立刻意识到自己的生命面临着极大的危险。他要想逃脱法律的制裁，惟一的办法就是让我闭上嘴巴。所以呢，我赶紧从抽屉里摸出左轮手枪，悄悄地塞进睡袍的口袋，隔着衣服对准了他。眼下他既然挑明了这一点，我便把扳好击铁的手枪从口袋里掏了出来，摆到了桌子上。他仍然笑眯眯地眨巴着眼睛，可他的眼神却让我觉得，手里有枪是一件值得庆幸的事情。","“The fact is that upon his entrance I had instantly recognized the extreme personal danger in which I lay. The only conceivable escape for him lay in silencing my tongue. In an instant I had slipped the revolver from the drawer into my pocket and was covering him through the cloth. At his remark I drew the weapon out and laid it cocked upon the table. He still smiled and blinked, but there was something about his eyes which made me feel very glad that I had it there."
"“‘您显然是对我缺乏了解，’他说。","“‘You evidently don’t know me,’ said he."
"“‘恰恰相反，’我这么回答他，‘要我说，真正显然的事情是我对您非常了解。请坐。如果您有话要说的话，我可以给您五分钟的时间。’","“‘On the contrary,’ I answered, ‘I think it is fairly evident that I do. Pray take a chair. I can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say.’"
"“‘我要说的话，都在您的意料之中，’他说。","“‘All that I have to say has already crossed your mind,’ said he."
"“‘如此说来，我的回答多半也在您的意料之中，’我说。","“‘Then possibly my answer has crossed yours,’ I replied."
"“‘您不肯让步吗？’","“‘You stand fast?’"
"“‘绝对不肯。 ’","“‘Absolutely.’"
"“他飞快地把手伸进自己的口袋，我赶紧抄起了桌上的手枪。不过，他掏出来的只是一个记事本，上面潦草地记着几个日期。","“He clapped his hand into his pocket, and I raised the pistol from the table. But he merely drew out a memorandum-book in which he had scribbled some dates."
"“‘一月四日，您挡了我的道，’他说。‘二十三日，您碍了我的事。二月中旬，您给我造成了极大的不便。三月底，我的计划碰上了无法逾越的障碍。眼下呢，四月即将过去，而我已经发现，由于您没完没了的迫害，我竟然实实在在地面临着丧失自由的危险。按我看，局面已经有点儿不堪忍受了。’","“‘You crossed my path on the fourth of January,’ said he. ‘On the twenty-third you incommoded me; by the middle of February I was seriously inconvenienced by you; at the end of March I was absolutely hampered in my plans; and now, at the close of April, I find myself placed in such a position through your continual persecution that I am in positive danger of losing my liberty. The situation is becoming an impossible one.’"
"“‘您有什么提议吗？’我问他。","“‘Have you any suggestion to make?’ I asked."
"“‘您必须住手，福尔摩斯先生，’他的脸依然在左摇右摆。‘您也知道，您真的别无选择。’","“‘You must drop it, Mr. Holmes,’ said he, swaying his face about. ‘You really must, you know.’"
"“‘过了周一再说吧，’我说。","“‘After Monday,’ said I."
"“‘啧，啧！’他说。‘您这么聪明，我敢肯定您非常清楚，这事情只能有一个结果。您必须见好就收，不收是不行的。您把事情搞到了今天这种地步，留给我们的只有一条出路。看到您纠缠这件事情的巧妙方法，实在是一种智力上的享受，说心里话，如果我被迫采取某种极端的措施，那可就太让人痛心了。您别笑，先生，我可以跟您保证，我真的会觉得非常痛心。’","“‘Tut, tut!’ said he. ‘I am quite sure that a man of your intelligence will see that there can be but one outcome to this affair. It is necessary that you should withdraw. You have worked things in such a fashion that we have only one resource left. It has been an intellectual treat to me to see the way in which you have grappled with this affair, and I say, unaffectedly, that it would be a grief to me to be forced to take any extreme measure. You smile, sir, but I assure you that it really would.’"
"“‘干了我这个行当，危险自然是家常便饭，’我说。","“‘Danger is part of my trade,’ I remarked."
"“‘这可不是危险，’他说。‘是无法逃脱的毁灭。让您挡了道的不是一个单枪匹马的个体，而是一个神通广大的组织，您虽然聪明绝顶，却也没能认识到它全部的力量。您必须靠边站，福尔摩斯先生，要不然会被踩扁的。’","“This is not danger,’ said he. ‘It is inevitable destruction. You stand in the way not merely of an individual but of a mighty organization, the full extent of which you, with all your cleverness, have been unable to realize. You must stand clear, Mr. Holmes, or be trodden under foot.’"
"“‘不好意思，’我一边说，一边站了起来，‘我光顾着享受跟您谈话的乐趣，恐怕已经耽搁了别处的一些待办要务。’","“‘I am afraid,’ said I, rising, ‘that in the pleasure of this conversation I am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere.’"
"“他也站了起来，默不作声地看着我，悲哀地摇了摇脑袋。","“He rose also and looked at me in silence, shaking his head sadly."
"“‘好吧，好吧，’他终于开了口。‘这事情似乎有点儿遗憾，可我已经尽我所能。您的每一步棋我都知道，周一之前您什么也干不了。这是你我二人的一场决斗，福尔摩斯先生。您想把我送上被告席，可我只能告诉您，我是绝对不会站上被告席的。您还想击败我，那我也只能告诉您，这事情您永远做不到。您要是聪明到了可以毁灭我的地步，那就请您尽管放心，我也能对您做到同样的事情。’","“‘Well, well,’ said he at last. ‘It seems a pity, but I have done what I could. I know every move of your game. You can do nothing before Monday. It has been a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell you that I will never stand in the dock. You hope to beat me. I tell you that you will never beat me. If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.’"
"“‘刚才您跟我客气了好几次，莫里亚蒂先生，’我说。‘容我也跟您客套一句。我要说的是，如果确信前一件事情能够实现的话，那么，为公众的利益起见，我会欣然接受后一件事情。’","“‘You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,’ said I. ‘Let me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality I would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.’"
"“‘我只能跟您担保其中一件，另一件我可担保不了，’他吼了一声，然后就转过身去，用他那佝偻的背脊对着我，一边东张西望，一边走出了房间。","“‘I can promise you the one, but not the other,’ he snarled, and so turned his rounded back upon me and went peering and blinking out of the room."
"“这就是我和莫里亚蒂教授的奇异会晤。坦白说，这次会晤让我心里很不愉快。他那些轻描淡写、严谨缜密的言语可说是掷地有声，绝不是咋咋唬唬的恐吓所能比拟。你当然会问，‘干吗不让警方对他采取措施呢？’答案就是我非常清楚，他自己不会动手，动手的只会是他的爪牙。情形必然会是这样，我已经有了再确凿不过的证据。”","“That was my singular interview with Professor Moriarty. I confess that it left an unpleasant effect upon my mind. His soft, precise fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity which a mere bully could not produce. Of course, you will say: ‘Why not take police precautions against him?’ The reason is that I am well convinced that it is from his agents the blow would fall. I have the best of proofs that it would be so.”"
"“他们已经对你下手了吗？”","“You have already been assaulted?”"
"“亲爱的华生，莫里亚蒂教授可不是一个干等着脚下长草的人。今天中午，我去牛津街办点事情，刚走到本廷克街转往维尔贝克街的那个拐角，一辆双驾货车就呼啸着转进本廷克街，闪电般地朝我碾了过来。我赶紧跳上人行道，间不容发地躲过了劫难。那辆货车一直冲进玛丽勒本路，转眼之间就不见了。从那时起，华生，我再也没敢离开人行道。可是，我走在维尔街上的时候[^4]，一块砖头突然从旁边一座房子的屋顶上掉了下来，在我脚边砸得粉碎。我叫来警察，让他们搜查了那座房子。他们发现屋顶堆着一些用于修缮的板瓦和砖块，于是就竭力让我相信，砖头是让风给刮下来的。我当然知道情形并非如此，但却拿不出任何证据。接下来，我坐上出租马车去了朴尔莫尔大街，整个下午都待在我哥哥家里。来你这儿的路上，一名手持大头棒的暴徒对我发起了袭击。我放倒了他，还把他交给了警察，不过，你可以放一百万个心，警方绝对找不出这位先生和那位退职数学教授之间的任何联系。我的指关节在这位先生的门牙上破皮见血的时候，那位教授，我敢说，肯定是在十英里之外的一块黑板跟前研究数学问题呢。华生啊，我一进门就关上了你家的窗板，刚才还不得不向你申请，要通过一条比前门隐蔽一点儿的路线离开你家，听了我这番解释，你应该不会再觉得奇怪了吧。”","“My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet. I went out about midday to transact some business in Oxford Street. As I passed the corner which leads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. I sprang for the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of a second. The van dashed round by Marylebone Lane and was gone in an instant. I kept to the pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses and was shattered to fragments at my feet. I called the police and had the place examined. There were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing. I took a cab after that and reached my brother’s rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the day. Now I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. I knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but I can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I daresay, working out problems upon a black-board ten miles away. You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.”"
"我经常都对我朋友的勇气赞佩不已，眼下就更是五体投地，因为他泰然自若地坐在那里，一件一件地数出了一长串事故。一天里就有这么多事故，这一天不知道该有多么恐怖。","I had often admired my friend’s courage, but never more than now, as he sat quietly checking off a series of incidents which must have combined to make up a day of horror."
"“你打算在这里过夜吗？”我说道。","“You will spend the night here?” I said."
"“不行啊，我的朋友，因为你兴许会发现，我这样的客人相当危险。我已经做好了计划，应该不会再有什么问题。事情进行到这个程度，他们不需要我的帮助也可以抓到犯人，当然喽，如果要给这些犯人定罪，没有我在场是不行的。显而易见，在警方可以全面出击之前的这几天，我最明智的选择就是暂时离开这里。所以呢，如果你能陪我去一趟欧洲大陆的话，那我就再高兴不过了。”","“No, my friend, you might find me a dangerous guest. I have my plans laid, and all will be well. Matters have gone so far now that they can move without my help as far as the arrest goes, though my presence is necessary for a conviction. It is obvious, therefore, that I cannot do better than get away for the few days which remain before the police are at liberty to act. It would be a great pleasure to me, therefore, if you could come on to the Continent with me.”"
"“诊所的生意十分清淡，”我说道，“隔壁的医生又非常愿意帮忙。乐意奉陪。”","“The practice is quiet,” said I, “and I have an accommodating neighbour. I should be glad to come.”"
"“明天早上就动身，没问题吧？”","“And to start to-morrow morning?”"
"“如果有这个必要的话。 ”","“If necessary.”"
"“噢，有必要，绝对有必要。好了，亲爱的华生，下面这些就是我的指示，请你务必严格执行，因为从现在开始，你就是我的搭档，得跟我一起对付整个欧洲最狡猾的匪徒，还有整个欧洲最强大的匪帮。听好！今天晚上，你得找一个靠得住的信差，让他把你打算携带的所有行李送到维多利亚车站，行李上不要写发往何处。明天早晨，你得打发仆人去叫一辆出租马车，还得叮嘱他，送上门来的第一辆和第二辆都不能要。然后呢，你跳上马车，让车夫载你到劳瑟拱廊[^5]靠斯特兰街的那个入口，你得把地址写在纸片上交给车夫，吩咐他别把纸片扔掉。你得预先付清车钱，马车一停就往拱廊里面冲，还得自己算好时间，总之要在九点一刻的时候冲到拱廊的另一头。届时会有一辆小型的四轮马车在路边等你，赶车的人身穿一件厚重的黑色斗篷，领口上镶着红边。坐上那辆马车之后，你就可以及时到达维多利亚车站，赶上开往欧洲大陆的快车。”","“Oh, yes, it is most necessary. Then these are your instructions, and I beg, my dear Watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in Europe. Now listen! You will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria to-night. In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself. Into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to the Strand end of the Lowther Arcade, handing the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away. Have your fare ready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash through the Arcade, timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter past nine. You will find a small brougham waiting close to the curb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red. Into this you will step, and you will reach Victoria in time for the Continental express.”"
"“咱们在哪儿碰头呢？”","“Where shall I meet you?”"
"“在车站碰头。我已经把从车头数的第二节头等车厢包了下来。”","“At the station. The second first-class carriage from the front will be reserved for us.”"
"“这么说，那节车厢就是咱们的集合地点喽？”","“The carriage is our rendezvous, then?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"不管我怎么劝说，福尔摩斯还是不肯留下来过夜。我心里明白，他之所以执意离去，怕的是给我家里招来麻烦。他匆匆交代了几句明天的事情，然后就站起身来，跟我一起走进花园，从墙头翻进了莫蒂默街。紧接着，我听见他打了个唿哨，叫住一辆出租马车，坐上马车离去了。","It was in vain that I asked Holmes to remain for the evening. It was evident to me that he thought he might bring trouble to the roof he was under, and that that was the motive which impelled him to go. With a few hurried words as to our plans for the morrow he rose and came out with me into the garden, clambering over the wall which leads into Mortimer Street, and immediately whistling for a hansom, in which I heard him drive away."
"第二天早上，我不折不扣地执行了福尔摩斯的指示。我叫人雇来一辆马车，雇车的时候也采取了相应的预防措施，杜绝了别人预先布下圈套的可能。吃过早饭之后，我立刻坐车赶到劳瑟拱廊，跟着就以最快的速度冲到了拱廊的另一头。一辆四轮马车已经等在那里，车夫块头很大，身上裹着黑色的斗篷。我刚刚踏进马车，车夫就扬鞭打马，马车立刻辚辚驶向维多利亚车站。我下车之后，他立刻掉转车头绝尘而去，连看都没有看我一眼。","In the morning I obeyed Holmes’s injunctions to the letter. A hansom was procured with such precautions as would prevent its being one which was placed ready for us, and I drove immediately after breakfast to the Lowther Arcade, through which I hurried at the top of my speed. A brougham was waiting with a very massive driver wrapped in a dark cloak, who, the instant that I had stepped in, whipped up the horse and rattled off to Victoria Station. On my alighting there he turned the carriage, and dashed away again without so much as a look in my direction."
"到这会儿为止，一切都进行得十分顺利。我的行李已经上了车，找福尔摩斯所说的那节车厢也没费什么力气。整列火车上只有那节车厢标着“已有预订”，找起来当然更加容易。让我担心的事情只有一件，那就是车站的时钟显示火车七分钟之后就要出发，福尔摩斯却始终没有露面。我在成群结队的旅客和送行亲友当中搜寻着我朋友的矫健身影，但却没有任何发现。这之后，我花了几分钟的时间来帮助一位年迈的意大利神父，因为他的英语非常蹩脚，怎么也没法让搬运工明白，应该把他的行李托运到巴黎。接下来，我又在周围找了一圈，然后就回到了车上。没想到，那个搬运工竟然擅作主张，把那位衰朽的意大利朋友变成了我的旅伴，也不管车票对不对得上。我想跟他解释他上错了车厢，可惜的是怎么也说不清楚，因为我的意大利语比他的英语还要蹩脚。于是我只好无可奈何地耸耸肩膀，继续焦灼不安地往窗子外面张望，寻觅着我朋友的身影。我心里渐渐涌起了一股冰凉的恐惧，因为我暗自揣测，今天他没有来，会不会是昨天夜里出了什么事情。眼看着车门已经悉数关闭，耳边也传来了汽笛的声音，就在这时——","So far all had gone admirably. My luggage was waiting for me, and I had no difficulty in finding the carriage which Holmes had indicated, the less so as it was the only one in the train which was marked “Engaged.” My only source of anxiety now was the non-appearance of Holmes. The station clock marked only seven minutes from the time when we were due to start. In vain I searched among the groups of travellers and leave-takers for the lithe figure of my friend. There was no sign of him. I spent a few minutes in assisting a venerable Italian priest, who was endeavouring to make a porter understand, in his broken English, that his luggage was to be booked through to Paris. Then, having taken another look round, I returned to my carriage, where I found that the porter, in spite of the ticket, had given me my decrepit Italian friend as a travelling companion. It was useless for me to explain to him that his presence was an intrusion, for my Italian was even more limited than his English, so I shrugged my shoulders resignedly, and continued to look out anxiously for my friend. A chill of fear had come over me, as I thought that his absence might mean that some blow had fallen during the night. Already the doors had all been shut and the whistle blown, when——"
"“亲爱的华生，”一个声音说道，“你的架子可真不小，连道声早安都不乐意。 ”","“My dear Watson,” said a voice, “you have not even condescended to say good-morning.”"
"我大吃一惊，不由自主地转过头去，刚好跟那位年迈的神父四目相对。刹那之间，他脸上的皱纹纷纷消失，鼻子高高耸起，下唇不再突出，嘴里不再念念有词，暗淡的眼睛重放光华，佝偻的身子也挺了起来。紧接着，他整个儿的身形再一次塌了下去，福尔摩斯再一次从我眼前消失，来得快去得也快。","I turned in uncontrollable astonishment. The aged ecclesiastic had turned his face towards me. For an instant the wrinkles were smoothed away, the nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip ceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the dull eyes regained their fire, the drooping figure expanded. The next the whole frame collapsed again, and Holmes had gone as quickly as he had come."
"“天哪！”我忍不住叫了起来，“你可真把我给吓坏了！”","“Good heavens!” I cried, “how you startled me!”"
"“眼下依然不能有丝毫大意，”他悄声说道。“我完全有理由相信，他们跟咱们如影随形。哈，那就是莫里亚蒂本人。”","“Every precaution is still necessary,” he whispered. “I have reason to think that they are hot upon our trail. Ah, there is Moriarty himself.”"
"福尔摩斯说话的时候，火车已经动了起来。我回头瞥了一眼，看见一个高个子男人正在发疯似的挤过人群，一只手还在不停挥舞，似乎是想让火车停下来。不过，他已经来迟一步，因为火车飞快地提高了速度，转眼就把车站远远地甩在了后面。","The train had already begun to move as Holmes spoke. Glancing back, I saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped. It was too late, however, for we were rapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later had shot clear of the station."
"“看见了吧，咱们千小心万小心，这次还是走得非常侥幸，”福尔摩斯笑着说道。这之后，他站了起来，脱下身上的黑袍黑帽，把这套神父行头装进了一个手提包。","“With all our precautions, you see that we have cut it rather fine,” said Holmes, laughing. He rose, and throwing off the black cassock and hat which had formed his disguise, he packed them away in a hand-bag."
"“今天的晨报你看了吗，华生？” ","“Have you seen the morning paper, Watson?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“这么说，贝克街的新闻你也没看见喽？”","“You haven’t seen about Baker Street, then?”"
"“贝克街？”","“Baker Street?”"
"“昨天夜里，他们点着了咱们的房子，还好是损失不大。”","“They set fire to our rooms last night. No great harm was done.”"
"“天哪，福尔摩斯，这可真叫人忍无可忍！”","“Good heavens, Holmes, this is intolerable!”"
"“那个拿大头棒的家伙被捕之后，他们一定是彻底失去了我的踪迹。要不然，他们就不会以为我回家去了。不过，他们显然没忘了派人盯你的梢，就是因为盯上了你，莫里亚蒂才追到了维多利亚车站。来车站的时候，你没出什么岔子吧？”","“They must have lost my track completely after their bludgeonman was arrested. Otherwise they could not have imagined that I had returned to my rooms. They have evidently taken the precaution of watching you, however, and that is what has brought Moriarty to Victoria. You could not have made any slip in coming?”"
"“我完全是按你说的做的。”","“I did exactly what you advised.”"
"“你赶上那辆四轮马车了吗？”","“Did you find your brougham?”"
"“是的，当时它就在那里等着。”","“Yes, it was waiting.”"
"“车夫是谁，你认出来了吗？” ","“Did you recognize your coachman?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“是我哥哥迈克罗夫特。这样的事情可不能托付给雇来的人，有了他，事情就方便多了。不过，咱们必须好好地盘算盘算，接下来该怎么应付莫里亚蒂。”","“It was my brother Mycroft. It is an advantage to get about in such a case without taking a mercenary into your confidence. But we must plan what we are to do about Moriarty now.”"
"“咱们坐的是趟快车，接下来又有联程的轮渡[^6]，依我看，咱们应该可以把他远远地甩在身后吧。 ”","“As this is an express, and as the boat runs in connection with it, I should think we have shaken him off very effectively.”"
"“亲爱的华生，之前我说过，这个人的智力水平多半是跟我本人不相上下，现在看来，你显然是没有认识到这句话的含义。换成是我来追踪的话，你总不至于认为，这么点儿微不足道的问题就能把我给难住吧。既然如此，你把他看得这么无能，道理又在哪里呢？”","“My dear Watson, you evidently did not realize my meaning when I said that this man may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual plane as myself. You do not imagine that if I were the pursuer I should allow myself to be baffled by so slight an obstacle. Why, then, should you think so meanly of him?”"
"“他会怎么做呢？”","“What will he do?”"
"“做我会做的事情。 ”","“What I should do.”"
"“那么，你会怎么做呢？”","“What would you do, then?”"
"“安排一趟专列。 ”","“Engage a special.”"
"“那也会比咱们晚。 ”","“But it must be late.”"
"“绝对不会。这趟车会在坎特伯雷[^7]停一阵，一般来说，轮渡至少也得等一刻钟。他会在渡口追上咱们的。”","“By no means. This train stops at Canterbury; and there is always at least a quarter of an hour’s delay at the boat. He will catch us there.”"
"“听你说这些，人家还以为咱俩是逃犯呢。咱们不妨通知警方，等他一到就逮捕他。”","“One would think that we were the criminals. Let us have him arrested on his arrival.”"
"“那样的话，整整三个月的辛劳就会付之流水。大鱼固然可以捉到，小鱼却会飞快地钻出网子。等到周一的话，咱们就可以一网打尽。不行，现在可不能逮捕他。”","“It would be to ruin the work of three months. We should get the big fish, but the smaller would dart right and left out of the net. On Monday we should have them all. No, an arrest is inadmissible.”"
"“那么，怎么办才好呢？”","“What then?”"
"“咱们应该在坎特伯雷下车。 ”","“We shall get out at Canterbury.”"
"“然后呢？”","“And then?”"
"“呃，然后咱们就从陆路前往纽黑文，再从纽黑文去迪耶普[^8]。扑空之后，莫里亚蒂又会做我会做的事情，那就是前往巴黎，找出咱们的行李所在的货栈，在货栈那里等上两天。与此同时，咱们不妨买上两个毡包，支持一下沿途各国的制造业[^9]，然后优哉游哉地前往卢森堡，再从巴塞尔进入瑞士。”","“Well, then we must make a cross-country journey to Newhaven, and so over to Dieppe. Moriarty will again do what I should do. He will get on to Paris, mark down our luggage, and wait for two days at the depot. In the meantime we shall treat ourselves to a couple of carpet-bags, encourage the manufactures of the countries through which we travel, and make our way at our leisure into Switzerland, via Luxembourg and Basle.”"
"作为一名经验丰富的旅行者，我并不觉得失去行李是一件十分不便的事情，不过我必须承认，被迫在这么个劣迹昭彰的家伙面前躲躲藏藏，我心里确实有点儿窝火。然而，显而易见，福尔摩斯比我更清楚眼下的形势[^10]。计议已定，我俩就在坎特伯雷下了车，结果却发现，还得等上一个小时才有去纽黑文的火车。","At Canterbury, therefore, we alighted, only to find that we should have to wait an hour before we could get a train to Newhaven."
"目送着载有我全部行装的行李车厢飞速远去，我不由得满心懊恼，就在这时，福尔摩斯拽了拽我的衣袖，指了指远方的铁道。","I was still looking rather ruefully after the rapidly disappearing luggage-van which contained my wardrobe, when Holmes pulled my sleeve and pointed up the line."
"“你瞧，他已经来了，”他说道。","“Already, you see,” said he."
"远远的地方，肯特郡的丛林之中升起了一缕轻烟。片刻之后，一部机车拖着一节车厢出现在了附近那段没有遮掩的弯道上，向着车站飞快地冲了过来。我俩刚刚藏到一堆行李后面，那列火车就一声长鸣，轰隆隆地驶过站台，热烘烘的空气扑到了我俩的脸上。","Far away, from among the Kentish woods there rose a thin spray of smoke. A minute later a carriage and engine could be seen flying along the open curve which leads to the station. We had hardly time to take our place behind a pile of luggage when it passed with a rattle and a roar, beating a blast of hot air into our faces."
"“他走啦，”我俩看着那列火车摇摇晃晃地驶过一个个道岔，福尔摩斯说道。“你瞧，咱们这位朋友的智力也是有极限的。要是他能够把我的演绎结果演绎出来、并且据此采取行动的话，那可就真是高明到家了。”","“There he goes,” said Holmes, as we watched the carriage swing and rock over the points. “There are limits, you see, to our friend’s intelligence. It would have been a *coup-de-maître* had he deduced what I would deduce and acted accordingly.”"
"“要是追上了咱们的话，他会怎么做呢？”","“And what would he have done had he overtaken us?”"
"“毫无疑问，他会向我发起致命一击。不过，谁死谁活还是未知之数。眼下的问题是，咱们是在这儿吃顿为时过早的午饭呢，还是冒一冒饥饿至死的风险，到了纽黑文再找饭馆。”","“There cannot be the least doubt that he would have made a murderous attack upon me. It is, however, a game at which two may play. The question now is whether we should take a premature lunch here, or run our chance of starving before we reach the buffet at Newhaven.”"
"我俩连夜赶到布鲁塞尔，在那里待了两天，第三天就到了斯特拉斯堡[^11]。周一早晨，福尔摩斯给伦敦警方发了封电报，当晚我俩回到酒店的时候，伦敦警方的回复已经到了。福尔摩斯一把扯开电报，跟着就痛骂一声，把电报扔进了壁炉。","We made our way to Brussels that night and spent two days there, moving on upon the third day as far as Strasbourg. On the Monday morning Holmes had telegraphed to the London police, and in the evening we found a reply waiting for us at our hotel. Holmes tore it open, and then with a bitter curse hurled it into the grate."
"“我早该想到会是这样！”他气冲冲地说道。“他跑掉了！”","“I might have known it!” he groaned. “He has escaped!”"
"“莫里亚蒂吗？”","“Moriarty?”"
"“他们把整个匪帮一网打尽，单单漏掉了他。他从他们手底下溜掉了。唉，既然我离开了英国，他当然是没有对手啦。可是，当时我真的以为，我交给他们的是一盘稳赢不输的棋。依我看，华生，你最好还是回英国去吧。”","“They have secured the whole gang with the exception of him. He has given them the slip. Of course, when I had left the country there was no one to cope with him. But I did think that I had put the game in their hands. I think that you had better return to England, Watson.”"
"“为什么？”","“Why?”"
"“因为我已经变成了一个危险的旅伴。这家伙的行当已经完了，再回伦敦也不会有任何出路。如果我没有看走眼的话，他一定会抛开一切，不遗余力地找我报仇。之前那次短暂的会晤当中，他就是这么跟我说的，依我看，他可绝不是说说而已。听我的，你一定得回你的诊所去。”","“Because you will find me a dangerous companion now. This man’s occupation is gone. He is lost if he returns to London. If I read his character right he will devote his whole energies to revenging himself upon me. He said as much in our short interview, and I fancy that he meant it. I should certainly recommend you to return to your practice.”"
"我可是一个沙场老将，又是他的老朋友，自然不会接受这样的提议。为了这个问题，我俩坐在斯特拉斯堡的餐厅里争论了半个小时。不过，当晚我俩还是继续赶路，并且平安地抵达了日内瓦。","It was hardly an appeal to be successful with one who was an old campaigner as well as an old friend. We sat in the Strasbourg *salle-à-manger* arguing the question for half an hour, but the same night we had resumed our journey and were well on our way to Geneva."
"我俩在罗讷河河谷四处漫游，度过了十分惬意的一周，之后就从洛伊克转入岔路，翻越依然覆盖着厚厚积雪的杰米隘口，取道因特拉肯进入迈林根[^12]。一路之上风光旖旎，山下是青葱秀美的春色，山上是纯白无瑕的冬景。不过，一望而知，福尔摩斯一刻也不曾忘却笼罩在他身上的那片阴影。不管是在风俗淳厚的阿尔卑斯山村，还是在荒僻无人的山间隘口，我都可以看到他四处扫视的迅疾眼神，看到他仔细打量从我们身边经过的每一张面孔，由此知道他确信无疑，不管我俩走到哪里，都不能逃脱那种如影随形的危险。","For a charming week we wandered up the valley of the Rhone, and then, branching off at Leuk, we made our way over the Gemmi Pass, still deep in snow, and so, by way of Interlaken, to Meiringen. It was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the spring below, the virgin white of the winter above; but it was clear to me that never for one instant did Holmes forget the shadow which lay across him. In the homely Alpine villages or in the lonely mountain passes, I could still tell by his quick glancing eyes and his sharp scrutiny of every face that passed us, that he was well convinced that, walk where we would, we could not walk ourselves clear of the danger which was dogging our footsteps."
"记得有一次，我俩刚刚翻过杰米隘口，正走在景色凄迷的道本湖边，一块巨大的岩石突然从右边的山梁上掉了下来，轰隆隆地翻滚了一路，咚的一声砸进了我俩身后的湖水。福尔摩斯立刻冲上山梁，站到高耸的峰顶，伸长了脖子四下张望。带路的向导一再向他保证，在这个地方，春天里掉石头实属等闲之事，可他始终不肯相信。他没有出言反驳，只是冲我笑了笑，用他的神态告诉我，这不过是他意料之中的事情。","Once, I remember, as we passed over the Gemmi, and walked along the border of the melancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us. In an instant Holmes had raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction. It was in vain that our guide assured him that a fall of stones was a common chance in the springtime at that spot. He said nothing, but he smiled at me with the air of a man who sees the fulfillment of that which he had expected."
"他虽然万分警惕，但却从来不曾垂头丧气。恰恰相反，在我的记忆之中，他还从来不曾有过如此意气昂扬的时刻。一次又一次，他不厌其烦地提醒我这样一个事实，一旦断定莫里亚蒂教授已经无法危害社会，他就可以高高兴兴地结束自己的侦探生涯。","And yet for all his watchfulness he was never depressed. On the contrary, I can never recollect having seen him in such exuberant spirits. Again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could be assured that society was freed from Professor Moriarty he would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion."
"“依我看，华生，我完全可以不揣冒昧地说一句，我的人生并非一无是处，”他如是说道。“即便我的人生篇章在今夜戛然而止，回首前尘，我依然可以问心无愧。因为我的存在，伦敦的空气多少清新了一些。我经手过上千件案子，扪心自问，我从来不曾将我的本领用到有违道义的方向。最近这段时间，我渐渐对大自然提出的种种问题产生了探究的兴趣，与之相较，我们这个矫揉造作的社会所引发的种种问题不免有点儿浅薄无稽。华生，一旦我擒获或者铲除这个危害与本领都堪称全欧之最的罪犯，由此登上我职业生涯的巅峰，你的回忆录就可以画上句号了。”","“I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain,” he remarked. “If my record were closed to-night I could still survey it with equanimity. The air of London is the sweeter for my presence. In over a thousand cases I am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side. Of late I have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible. Your memoirs will draw to an end, Watson, upon the day that I crown my career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable criminal in Europe.”"
"我要讲的故事已经接近终篇，我会简明扼要地把它讲完，同时也会力求准确无误。这个话题我并不愿意多谈，与此同时，我已经意识到，我有责任还原事情的真相，不能遗漏任何细节。","I shall be brief, and yet exact, in the little which remains for me to tell. It is not a subject on which I would willingly dwell, and yet I am conscious that a duty devolves upon me to omit no detail."
"我俩是五月三号抵达迈林根的。到了那个小村之后，我俩住进了“英吉利旅馆”。旅馆的东家名为老彼得·斯泰勒，脑子非常好使，曾在伦敦的格罗夫纳酒店当过三年侍应，说得一口流利的英语。按照他推荐的路线，我俩在四日下午出门游玩，打算翻过几座小山，到罗森洛伊村去过夜。除此之外，他郑而重之地叮嘱我俩，绝不能错过半山的莱辛巴赫瀑布，无论如何也要绕点儿路去欣赏一下。","It was on the third of May that we reached the little village of Meiringen, where we put up at the Englischer Hof, then kept by Peter Steiler the elder. Our landlord was an intelligent man and spoke excellent English, having served for three years as waiter at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. At his advice, on the afternoon of the fourth we set off together, with the intention of crossing the hills and spending the night at the hamlet of Rosenlaui. We had strict injunctions, however, on no account to pass the falls of Reichenbach, which are about halfway up the hills, without making a small detour to see them."
"千真万确，那是个惊心动魄的地方。挟着消融的积雪，水势大盛的滚滚激流猛然跌进可怕的深渊，水雾层层上涌，宛如失火房屋的浓烟。河水跌落的终点本来就是一道巨大的裂缝，周围那些漆黑发亮的岩石更把它箍成了一个白沫翻腾、深不可测的洞穴，满溢的水流从犬牙交错的洞口射向上空。又宽又长的碧色水流无休无止地轰然坠落，摇曳的水汽则形成了一道厚重的帘幕，无休无止地嘶嘶上涌，混乱与喧嚣持续不断，令人头晕目眩。我俩站在崖边，凝望瀑水坠入远远的下方、在黑色的岩石上溅起亮闪闪的水花，倾听瀑水那宛如怒吼的轰鸣，挟着深渊之中的水雾腾腾升起。","It is, indeed, a fearful place. The torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. The shaft into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm, lined by glistening coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip. The long sweep of green water roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamour. We stood near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black rocks, and listening to the half-human shout which came booming up with the spray out of the abyss."
"观瀑的小径凿在瀑布崖壁的半高处，为的是让游人看到瀑布的全貌，小径的尽头则是一道断崖，游人只能原路折返。我俩刚刚转过身来，准备往回走，却见一名瑞士青年沿着小径跑了过来，手里还拿着一封信。信上有我俩刚刚离开的那家旅馆的标记，是旅馆的东家写给我的。信上说，我俩刚走没几分钟，旅馆里就来了一位英国女士。该女士患有肺结核，已经到了晚期，之前是在达沃斯普拉茨过冬，眼下则准备去卢塞恩访友[^13]，不料却突然咯血，据估计是只剩下几个小时的生命。即便如此，如果能得到一名英国医生的照料，对她来说也是极大的安慰。既有此等情形，请问我是否愿意返回旅馆，如此等等。好心的斯泰勒还在附言里恳切表示，该女士断然拒绝瑞士医生的诊治，因此他自感责任重大，如果我遵嘱返回，他本人也将感激不尽。","The path has been cut halfway round the fall to afford a complete view, but it ends abruptly, and the traveller has to return as he came. We had turned to do so, when we saw a Swiss lad come running along it with a letter in his hand. It bore the mark of the hotel which we had just left and was addressed to me by the landlord. It appeared that within a very few minutes of our leaving, an English lady had arrived who was in the last stage of consumption. She had wintered at Davos Platz and was journeying now to join her friends at Lucerne, when a sudden hemorrhage had overtaken her. It was thought that she could hardly live a few hours, but it would be a great consolation to her to see an English doctor, and, if I would only return, etc. The good Steiler assured me in a postscript that he would himself look upon my compliance as a very great favour, since the lady absolutely refused to see a Swiss physician, and he could not but feel that he was incurring a great responsibility."
"面对这样的要求，我自然不能置之不理。一位女性同胞即将客死异乡，拒绝她的请求实在是件无法想象的事情。可是，要让我撇下福尔摩斯，我终归觉得顾虑重重。不过，我们最终还是商量出了一个办法，那就是我暂时返回迈林根，那名年青的瑞士信差则留在这里，充当他的向导和旅伴。我朋友说，他打算在瀑布旁边稍事停留，然后就慢慢地翻山前往罗森洛伊。傍晚时分，我可以到那里去跟他会合。转身离去的时候，我看见福尔摩斯背靠一块岩石，双臂抱在胸前，正在凝神俯瞰飞泻的瀑水。谁曾想天意茫茫，这一眼，便是我今生最后一次看到他的身影。","The appeal was one which could not be ignored. It was impossible to refuse the request of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land. Yet I had my scruples about leaving Holmes. It was finally agreed, however, that he should retain the young Swiss messenger with him as guide and companion while I returned to Meiringen. My friend would stay some little time at the fall, he said, and would then walk slowly over the hill to Rosenlaui, where I was to rejoin him in the evening. As I turned away I saw Holmes, with his back against a rock and his arms folded, gazing down at the rush of the waters. It was the last that I was ever destined to see of him in this world."
"快到山脚的时候，我回头望了一眼。瀑布已经不在视线范围之内，能看见的只是山腰那条通往瀑布的蜿蜒小径。我记得，当时我看到了一个男人，正在小径上急速前行。","When I was near the bottom of the descent I looked back. It was impossible, from that position, to see the fall, but I could see the curving path which winds over the shoulder of the hills and leads to it. Along this a man was, I remember, walking very rapidly."
"青葱山崖映衬之下，那人的黑色身影显得格外清晰。我注意到了他，也注意到了他健步如飞的匆匆行色，可我很快就把这件事情置之脑后，因为我要务在身，自己也是脚下生风。","I could see his black figure clearly outlined against the green behind him. I noted him, and the energy with which he walked, but he passed from my mind again as I hurried on upon my errand."
"大概用了一个钟头多一点点的时间，我赶回了迈林根。老斯泰勒站在旅馆的门廊里。","It may have been a little over an hour before I reached Meiringen. Old Steiler was standing at the porch of his hotel."
"“呃，”我一边急步上前，一边说道，“要我说，她的病情没有恶化吧？”","“Well,” said I, as I came hurrying up, “I trust that she is no worse?”"
"诧异的表情掠过了他的脸庞，随着他眉毛一挑，我的心猛然一坠，仿佛是灌满了铅。","A look of surprise passed over his face, and at the first quiver of his eyebrows my heart turned to lead in my breast."
"“这封信不是你写的吗？”我把兜里的信掏了出来。“旅馆里没有患病的英国女士吗？”","“You did not write this?” I said, pulling the letter from my pocket. “There is no sick Englishwoman in the hotel?”"
"“当然没有！”他叫道。“怪了，信上的确有旅馆的标记哩！啊，这一定是那位高个子的英国先生写的，你们走了之后他才来的。他说——”","“Certainly not!” he cried. “But it has the hotel mark upon it! Ha, it must have been written by that tall Englishman who came in after you had gone. He said——”"
"恐惧的感觉传遍了我的全身，不等他接着解释，我已经顺着村里的街道跑了出去，跑向我片刻之前刚刚离开的那条山径。下来的时候我用了一个钟头，此时我使尽了浑身力气，但却还是用了两个钟头才赶回莱辛巴赫瀑布跟前。福尔摩斯的登山杖依然斜倚在岩石上，跟我离开的时候一样。可是，手杖的主人已经不见踪影，不管我怎么呼唤，回应我的都只有我自己的声音，在四围的峭壁之间反复盘旋。","But I waited for none of the landlord’s explanation. In a tingle of fear I was already running down the village street, and making for the path which I had so lately descended. It had taken me an hour to come down. For all my efforts two more had passed before I found myself at the fall of Reichenbach once more. There was Holmes’s Alpine-stock still leaning against the rock by which I had left him. But there was no sign of him, and it was in vain that I shouted. My only answer was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me."
"看到他的登山杖，我不由得满心寒意、天旋地转。这么说，他并没有去罗森洛伊。他的敌人追上他的时候，他仍然在这条三英尺宽的小径上，一边是高不可攀的绝壁，一边是深不可测的悬崖。那个瑞士青年也不见了，由此看来，他多半是得了莫里亚蒂的好处，所以才抽身离去，任由这两个宿敌去拼个你死我活。那么，接下来又发生了什么事情呢？谁能告诉我们，接下来发生了什么事情呢？","It was the sight of that Alpine-stock which turned me cold and sick. He had not gone to Rosenlaui, then. He had remained on that three-foot path, with sheer wall on one side and sheer drop on the other, until his enemy had overtaken him. The young Swiss had gone too. He had probably been in the pay of Moriarty and had left the two men together. And then what had happened? Who was to tell us what had happened then?"
"可怕的局面让我头晕目眩，于是我在原地站了一两分钟，竭力平复自己的情绪。接下来，我开始回想福尔摩斯的种种方法，试着用它们来解读眼前的悲剧。老天啊，眼前的悲剧实在是太过一目了然，哪里还需要什么解读。之前我和他商量的时候，我俩并不是站在小径的尽头，他的登山杖可以说明我俩当时的位置。水雾无休无止，小径上那些黑黢黢的土壤始终处于潮湿松软的状态，如果从小径上走过，即便是鸟儿也会留下爪子的印迹。此时此刻，小径的外侧有两行清晰的足迹，两行都是有去无回。离小径尽头只有几码的地方，土壤已经被践踏成一片泥泞，断崖边缘的树莓和蕨类也是狼藉凌乱，纷纷倒伏在泥泞之中。我趴到地面，尽力透过笼罩四周的升腾水雾窥视下方的情形。可是，天色已经比我离开的时候昏暗了一些，眼下我只能看见湿漉漉的黝黑崖壁，看见崖壁上东一处西一处的反光，看见水流在远远的深坑底部溅起白亮亮的水花。我大声呼叫，传回耳边的却只有那种宛如怒吼的瀑水轰鸣，跟先前一模一样。","I stood for a minute or two to collect myself, for I was dazed with the horror of the thing. Then I began to think of Holmes’s own methods and to try to practise them in reading this tragedy. It was, alas, only too easy to do. During our conversation we had not gone to the end of the path, and the Alpine-stock marked the place where we had stood. The blackish soil is kept forever soft by the incessant drift of spray, and a bird would leave its tread upon it. Two lines of footmarks were clearly marked along the farther end of the path, both leading away from me. There were none returning. A few yards from the end the soil was all ploughed up into a patch of mud, and the brambles and ferns which fringed the chasm were torn and bedraggled. I lay upon my face and peered over with the spray spouting up all around me. It had darkened since I left, and now I could only see here and there the glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far away down at the end of the shaft the gleam of the broken water. I shouted; but only that same half-human cry of the fall was borne back to my ears."
"不过，上苍怜悯，我终归还是找到了我的朋友兼战友留给我的临别赠言。前面我已经说过，他的登山杖仍然斜倚在一块伸入小径的突出岩石上。这时候我看见，一件明晃晃的东西在岩石的顶上闪了一闪。抬手去拿的时候，我发现闪光来自一个银质的烟盒，正是他平常随身携带的物品。我拿起烟盒，压在烟盒下面的那个纸折的小方块应手而落、翩然坠地。展开之后，方块变成了他从笔记本上撕下来的三页纸，纸上是一封写给我的信。这封信与他素日的信件毫无二致，措辞依然精准无误，笔迹依然刚劲清晰，宛如出自他的书房。","But it was destined that I should, after all, have a last word of greeting from my friend and comrade. I have said that his Alpine-stock had been left leaning against a rock which jutted on to the path. From the top of this boulder the gleam of something bright caught my eye, and raising my hand I found that it came from the silver cigarette-case which he used to carry. As I took it up a small square of paper upon which it had lain fluttered down on to the ground. Unfolding it, I found that it consisted of three pages torn from his notebook and addressed to me. It was characteristic of the man that the direction was as precise, and the writing as firm and clear, as though it had been written in his study."

"> 我能够写下你眼前的这几行文字，多亏了莫里亚蒂先生的美意，此刻他正在静待我写完此信，以便与他展开最后的讨论，解决我和他之间的种种问题。他已经向我大致讲述了他摆脱英国警方的方法，以及他侦知你我行踪的手段。毫无疑问，他那些手段足以确证，我对他本领的高度评价并非过誉，而我非常欣慰地发现，我应该可以让这个社会从此免受因他而来的种种荼毒，尽管我不无忧虑，我为此付出的代价恐怕会伤害到我的各位友人，尤其是你，亲爱的华生。不过，正如我曾经向你解释的那样，无论如何，我的职业生涯终归是面临转折，对我来说，再没有比这更让人满意的谢幕方式。事实上，如果你允许我彻底坦白的话，我完全知道那封来自迈林根的信件是个骗局，而我之所以同意你回去应付那件差使，正是因为我确信无疑，这类的事情将会接踵而至。麻烦你转告帕特森督察，指证匪帮所需的文件都在编号为“M”的文件格子里，格子里有一个蓝色的信封，信封上写着“莫里亚蒂”。离开英格兰之前，我已经对我的财产进行了妥善的处理，将它们交给了我哥哥迈克罗夫特。代我向尊夫人问好，亲爱的伙计，请相信我始终是","> I write these few lines through the courtesy of Mr. Moriarty, who awaits my convenience for the final discussion of those questions which lie between us. He has been giving me a sketch of the methods by which he avoided the English police and kept himself informed of our movements. They certainly confirm the very high opinion which I had formed of his abilities. I am pleased to think that I shall be able to free society from any further effects of his presence, though I fear that it is at a cost which will give pain to my friends, and especially, my dear Watson, to you. I have already explained to you, however, that my career had in any case reached its crisis, and that no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial to me than this. Indeed, if I may make a full confession to you, I was quite convinced that the letter from Meiringen was a hoax, and I allowed you to depart on that errand under the persuasion that some development of this sort would follow. Tell Inspector Patterson that the papers which he needs to convict the gang are in pigeonhole M., done up in a blue envelope and inscribed “Moriarty.” I made every disposition of my property before leaving England and handed it to my brother Mycroft. Pray give my greetings to Mrs. Watson, and believe me to be, my dear fellow,"

"剩下的少许枝节，几句话就可以讲完。经过专家的勘验，毫无疑问，两个人进行了一场生死格斗，最终则以一种势所必然的方式收场，也就是两人扭作一团，双双滚落悬崖。找回尸体实属绝无指望，这样看来，当代最凶恶的罪犯将会和当代最伟大的法律卫士结伴长眠，永远安息在那个可怕绝壑的深处、安息在奔腾的激流和鼎沸的水沫之中。那个瑞士青年从此杳如黄鹤，无疑是莫里亚蒂帐下无数爪牙之一。至于那个匪帮，公众应该依然记得，福尔摩斯搜集的那些指控他们的证据是多么地完备，这位逝者的铁拳又对他们造成了多么沉重的打击。不过，当时的审判几乎没有涉及他们那个可怕头领的详细情况，而我之所以要在这里毫不含糊地揭露他的罪恶生涯，实在也是事出无奈，因为一些不明真相的拥趸正在竭力恢复他的名誉，为此还不惜诋毁另外一个人，与此同时，在我的心目之中，他们诋毁的对象永远都是我生平所知最为优秀、最为睿智的人[^14]。","A few words may suffice to tell the little that remains. An examination by experts leaves little doubt that a personal contest between the two men ended, as it could hardly fail to end in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked in each other’s arms. Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful cauldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation. The Swiss youth was never found again, and there can be no doubt that he was one of the numerous agents whom Moriarty kept in his employ. As to the gang, it will be within the memory of the public how completely the evidence which Holmes had accumulated exposed their organization, and how heavily the hand of the dead man weighed upon them. Of their terrible chief few details came out during the proceedings, and if I have now been compelled to make a clear statement of his career, it is due to those injudicious champions who have endeavoured to clear his memory by attacks upon him whom I shall ever regard as the best and the wisest man whom I have ever known."
