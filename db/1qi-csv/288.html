		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >前者的名字叫玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜·卡里金。她的丈夫倔强易怒、精明果断，已经去世十年了。他曾任省检察官，生前工作出色，在职时享有盛誉。他上过大学，受过良好的教育，但是由于出身贫寒，他早早就懂得必须奋力向前闯并且多多赚钱。玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜和他是恋爱结婚的。他长得不错，人也聪明，乐意的时候，还可以表现得非常和蔼可亲。玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜·佩斯托（她出嫁以前姓佩斯托）幼年时就失去了双亲。她曾在莫斯科的一所寄宿学校上了几年学，毕业后，与姑姑、哥哥一起住在离O省城四十英里的祖产波克罗夫斯基村。没过多久，她的这个哥哥去彼得斯堡任职，让她们靠微薄的津贴过活。他对他的姑姑和妹妹一直很吝啬，直到死神突降，终断了他的事业。玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜继承了波克罗夫斯基村，不过并没有在那里住多久。在她和卡里金——这个几天内就赢得了她的芳心的男人——结婚两年后，她就用波克罗夫斯基村换得了另一处地产，这块地产的收益要多得多，但是一点也不美，也没有娱乐场所。同时，卡里金在O市购买了一幢房子，在那里长久地居住下来。这幢房子周围有一个大花园，从花园的一边可以将城外空旷的田野一览无余。</td>
		<td class="en">The name of the former was Marya Dmitrievna Kalitin.Her husband, a shrewd determined man of obstinate bilious temperament, had been dead for ten years.He had been a provincial public prosecutor, noted in his own day as a successful man of business.He had received a fair education and had been to the university; but having been born in narrow circumstances he realized early in life the necessity of pushing his own way in the world and making money.It had been a love-match on Marya Dmitrievna’s side.He was not bad-looking, was clever and could be very agreeable when he chose.Marya Dmitrievna Pesto—that was her maiden name—had lost her parents in childhood.She spent some years in a boarding-school in Moscow, and after leaving school, lived on the family estate of Pokrovskoe, about forty miles from O—, with her aunt and her elder brother.This brother soon after obtained a post in Petersburg, and made them a scanty allowance.He treated his aunt and sister very shabbily till his sudden death cut short his career.Marya Dmitrievna inherited Pokrovskoe, but she did not live there long.Two years after her marriage with Kalitin, who succeeded in winning her heart in a few days, Pokrovskoe was exchanged for another estate, which yielded a much larger income, but was utterly unattractive and had no house.At the same time Kalitin took a house in the town of O—, in which he and his wife took up their permanent abode.There was a large garden round the house, which on one side looked out upon the open country away from the town.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“And so,” decided Kalitin, who had a great distaste for the quiet of country life, “there would be no need for them to be dragging themselves off into the country.”In her heart Marya Dmitrievna more than once regretted her pretty Pokrovskoe, with its babbling brook, its wide meadows, and green copses; but she never opposed her husband in anything and had the greatest veneration for his wisdom and knowledge of the world.When after fifteen years of married life he died leaving her with a son and two daughters, Marya Dmitrievna had grown so accustomed to her house and to town life that she had no inclination to leave O—.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜年轻时是公认的漂亮金发女郎。如今，年至半百的她虽然身材失去了魅力，身姿不那么曼妙，却也风韵犹存。与其说她心地善良，倒不如说她多愁善感，甚至成年之后还保留着寄宿学校时的习气。她做事自我放纵，动不动就生气，稍不如意时甚至开始哭闹。但是，当她事事如愿、样样称心时，她也显得可亲可爱。她的住宅是市里最舒适宜人的房子之一。她家产颇丰，其中大部分不是她自己的，而是她丈夫的积蓄。两个女儿与她住在一起，儿子在彼得斯堡一所最好的公立学校读书。</td>
		<td class="en">In her youth Marya Dmitrievna had always been spoken of as a pretty blonde; and at fifty her features had not lost all charm, though they were somewhat coarser and less delicate in outline.She was more sentimental than kindhearted; and even at her mature age, she retained the manners of the boarding-school.She was self-indulgent and easily put out, even moved to tears when she was crossed in any of her habits.She was, however, very sweet and agreeable when all her wishes were carried out and none opposed her.Her house was among the pleasantest in the town.She had a considerable fortune, not so much from her own property as from her husband’s savings.Her two daughters were living with her; her son was being educated in one of the best government schools in Petersburg.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The old lady sitting with Marya Dmitrievna at the window was her father’s sister, the same aunt with whom she had once spent some solitary years in Pokrovskoe.Her name was Marfa Timofyevna Pestov.She had a reputation for eccentricity as she was a woman of an independent character, told every one the truth to his face, and even in the most straitened circumstances behaved just as if she had a fortune at her disposal.She could not endure Kalitin, and directly her niece married him, she removed to her little property, where for ten whole years she lived in a smoky peasants’ hut.Marya Dmitrievna was a little afraid of her.A little sharp-nosed woman with black hair and keen eyes even in her old age, Marfa Timofyevna walked briskly, held herself upright and spoke quickly and clearly in a sharp ringing voice.She always wore a white cap and a white dressing-jacket.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Why is it Gedeonovsky does not come?” observed Marfa Timofyevna, moving her knitting needles quickly.(She was knitting a large woolen scarf.)“He would have sighed with you—or at least he’d have had some fib to tell you.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“And no wonder!It was he who picked him out of the gutter,” muttered Marfa Timofyevna, and her knitting needles moved faster than ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看上去倒还温顺老实，”她又接着说，“头发都全白了，可是一张嘴，不是说瞎话就是说别人的坏话。亏他还是个五等文官呢！不过，当然了，他不过只是个乡下牧师的儿子。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He looks so meek and mild,” she began again, “with his grey head, but he no sooner opens his mouth than out comes a lie or a slander.And to think of his having the rank of a councillor!To be sure, though, he’s only a village priest’s son.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“人无完人嘛，姑姑，不过他确实有这个毛病。谢尔盖·彼得罗维奇没有受过什么教育，当然也不会说法语。不过，不管您怎么说，他仍然是个讨人喜欢的人。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，他一直对你奉承有加嘛。他不会说法语——这也不是什么大不了的事。我的法国方言也说得一般。如果他什么语言都不会说，那就最好不过了，那样他就不会撒谎了。他来了，真是说曹操，曹操到。”玛尔法·季莫菲耶芙娜朝大街上望了望，接着说，“你那位讨人喜欢的人正大步走过来。瘦长瘦长的，简直像只鹤！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, he is always ready to kiss your hands.He does not speak French—that’s no great loss.I am not over strong in the French lingo myself.It would be better if he could not speak at all; he would not tell lies then.But here he is—speak of the devil,” added Marfa Timofyevna looking into the street.“Here comes your agreeable man striding along.What a lanky creature he is, just like a stork!”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们刚刚给读者介绍的这位年轻人名叫弗拉基米尔·尼古拉伊奇·潘申。他在彼得斯堡的内务部任职，是个特派官员。他来O市是为了执行一些临时公务，听从省长佐宁堡将军的指挥，而这位省长又碰巧是他的远房亲戚。潘申的父亲是一位退役骑兵军官，也是个臭名昭著的赌徒。他双眼谄媚，面容憔悴，嘴巴老是神经质地抽搐着。他一生都在贵族社会厮混，经常光顾两个都城里的英国俱乐部。大家都认为他非常精明，但是不太靠得住，不过他这个人温厚和善、快活高兴。尽管他很精明，却常常处于破产边缘，也没给儿子留下什么家产，反而还债台高筑。不过，为了弥补这点，他以自己的方式注重儿子的教育。所以弗拉基米尔·尼古拉伊奇法语说得很棒，英语也不错，德语就不行了。这也是理所当然的——时尚男女都耻于说一口流利的德语，不过在打趣的时候偶尔说上几个德语词还是可以的。正如彼得斯堡的法国人说的那样：这是一种时髦。弗拉基米尔·尼古拉伊奇从十五岁时就开始知道该如何从容大方地进入任何人家的客厅，以及怎样在那里优雅自如地走动，还会在适当的时候起身告辞。潘申的父亲为了他的儿子找了不少关系。在两局牌洗牌的空当，或者打牌得胜的时候，他都会向任何一位爱好打牌的名贵提起他的沃洛吉卡（弗拉基米尔的小名）。弗拉基米尔在大学读书时（他毕业时成绩并不突出），也结识了一些贵族出身的年轻朋友，开始出入豪门贵族之家了。他到哪里都会受到热情接待：他仪表不凡、举止儒雅、风趣幽默；一向身强体壮，对各种应酬得心应手；需要礼貌的时候，他谦恭有礼；有时还胆敢粗野无礼；他是一个出色的伙伴，一个魅力四射的青年。他的前景一片美好。潘申不久就掌握了上流社会中为人处事的秘诀。他知道如何真心尊重这些准则来获得成功，还知道如何在处理琐事时带点办讽刺性的严肃，把严肃的事情当作小事看待。他舞艺超群，穿衣打扮俨然一副英国派头。他很快被誉为是彼得斯堡最聪明、最有魅力的年轻人之一了。</td>
		<td class="en">The name of the young man whom we have just introduced to the reader was Vladimir Nikolaitch Panshin.He served in Petersburg on special commissions in the department of internal affairs.He had come to the town of O— to carry out some temporary government commissions, and was in attendance on the Governor-General Zonnenberg, to whom he happened to be distantly related.Panshin’s father, a retired cavalry officer and a notorious gambler, was a man with insinuating eyes, a battered countenance, and a nervous twitch about the mouth.He spent his whole life hanging about the aristocratic world; frequented the English clubs of both capitals, and had the reputation of a smart, not very trustworthy, but jolly good-natured fellow.In spite of his smartness, he was almost always on the brink of ruin, and the property he left his son was small and heavily-encumbered.To make up for that, however, he did exert himself, after his own fashion, over his son’s education.Vladimir Nikolaitch spoke French very well, English well, and German badly; that is the proper thing; fashionable people would be ashamed to speak German well; but to utter an occasional—generally a humorous—phrase in German is quite correct, c’est meme tres chic, as the Parisians of Petersburg express themselves.By the time he was fifteen, Vladimir knew how to enter any drawing-room without embarrassment, how to move about in it gracefully and to leave it at the appropriate moment.Panshin’s father gained many connections for his son.He never lost an opportunity, while shuffling the cards between two rubbers, or playing a successful trump, of dropping a hint about his Volodka to any personage of importance who was a devotee of cards.And Vladimir, too, during his residence at the university, which he left without a very brilliant degree, formed an acquaintance with several young men of quality, and gained an entry into the best houses.He was received cordially everywhere: he was very good-looking, easy in his manners, amusing, always in good health, and ready for everything; respectful, when he ought to be; insolent, when he dared to be; excellent company, un charmant garcon.The promised land lay before him.Panshin quickly learnt the secret of getting on in the world; he knew how to yield with genuine respect to its decrees; he knew how to take up trifles with half ironical seriousness, and to appear to regard everything serious as trifling; he was a capital dancer; and dressed in the English style.In a short time he gained the reputation of being one of the smartest and most attractive young men in Petersburg.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Christopher Theodor Gottlieb Lemm was born in 1786 in the town of Chemnitz in Saxony.His parents were poor musicians.His father played the French horn, his mother the harp; he himself was practising on three different instruments by the time he was five.At eight years old he was left an orphan, and from his tenth year he began to earn his bread by his art.He led a wandering life for many years, and performed everywhere in restaurants, at fairs, at peasants’ weddings, and at balls.At last he got into an orchestra and constantly rising in it, he obtained the position of director.He was rather a poor performer; but he understood music thoroughly.At twenty-eight he migrated into Russia, on the invitation of a great nobleman, who did not care for music himself, but kept an orchestra for show.Lemm lived with him seven years in the capacity of orchestra conductor, and left him empty-handed.The nobleman was ruined, he intended to give him a promissory note, but in the sequel refused him even that—in short, did not pay him a farthing.He was advised to go away; but he was unwilling to return home in poverty from Russia, that great Russia which is a mine of gold for artists; he decided to remain and try his luck.For twenty years the poor German had been trying his luck; he had lived in various gentlemen’s houses, had suffered and put up with much, had faced privation, had struggled like a fish on the ice; but the idea of returning to his own country never left him among all the hardships he endured; it was this dream alone that sustained him.But fate did not see fit to grant him this last and first happiness: at fifty, broken-down in health and prematurely aged, he drifted to the town of O—, and remained there for good, having now lost once for all every hope of leaving Russia, which he detested.He gained his poor livelihood somehow by lessons.Lemm’s exterior was not prepossessing.He was short and bent, with crooked shoulders, and contracted chest, with large flat feet, and bluish white nails on the gnarled bony fingers of his sinewy red hands.He had a wrinkled face, sunken cheeks, and compressed lips, which he was for ever twitching and biting; and this, together with his habitual taciturnity, produced an impression almost sinister.His grey hair hung in tufts on his low brow; like smouldering embers, his little set eyes glowed with dull fire.He moved painfully, at every step swinging his ungainly body forward.Some of his movements recalled the clumsy actions of an owl in a cage when it feels that it is being looked at, but itself can hardly see out of its great yellow eyes timorously and drowsily blinking.Pitiless, prolonged sorrow had laid its indelible stamp on the poor musician; it had disfigured and deformed his person, by no means attractive to begin with.But any one who was able to get over the first impression would have discerned something good, and honest, and out of the common in this half-shattered creature.A devoted admirer of Bach and Handel, a master of his art, gifted with a lively imagination and that boldness of conception which is only vouchsafed to the German race, Lemm might, in time—who knows?—have taken rank with the great composers of his fatherland, had his life been different; but he was born under an unlucky star!He had written much in his life, and it had not been granted to him to see one of his compositions produced; he did not know how to set about things in the right way, to gain favour in the right place, and to make a push at the right moment.A long, long time ago, his one friend and admirer, also a German and also poor, had published two of Lemm’s sonatas at his own expense—the whole edition remained on the shelves of the music-shops; they disappeared without a trace, as though they had been thrown into a river by night.At last Lemm had renounced everything; the years too did their work; his mind had grown hard and stiff, as his fingers had stiffened.He lived alone in a little cottage not far from the Kalitin’s house, with an old cook he had taken out of the poorhouse (he had never married).He took long walks, and read the Bible and the Protestant version of the Psalms, and Shakespeare in Schlegel’s translation.He had composed nothing for a long time; but apparently, Lisa, his best pupil, had been able to inspire him; he had written for her the cantata to which Panshin had made allusion.The words of this cantata he had borrowed from his collection of hymns.He had added a few verses of his own.It was sung by two choruses—a chorus of the happy and a chorus of the unhappy.The two were brought into harmony at the end, and sang together, “Merciful God, have pity on us sinners, and deliver us from all evil thoughts and earthly hopes.”On the title-page was the inscription, most carefully written and even illuminated, “Only the righteous are justified.A religious cantata.Composed and dedicated to Miss Elisaveta Kalitin, his dear pupil, by her teacher, C. T. G. Lemm.”The words, “Only the righteous are justified” and “Elisaveta Kalitin,” were encircled by rays.Below was written: “For you alone, fur Sie allein.”This was why Lemm had grown red, and looked reproachfully at Lisa; he was deeply wounded when Panshin spoke of his cantata before him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Fedor Ivanitch Lavretsky—we must ask the reader’s permission to break off the thread of our story for a time—came of an old noble family.The founder of the house of Lavretskky came over from Prussia in the reign of Vassili the Blind, and received a grant of two hundred chetverts of land in Byezhetsk.Many of his descendants filled various offices, and served under princes and persons of eminence in outlying districts, but not one of them rose above the rank of an inspector of the Imperial table nor acquired any considerable fortune.The richest and most distinguished of all the Lavretskys was Fedor Ivanitch’s great-grandfather, Andrei, a man cruel and daring, cunning and able.Even to this day stories still linger of his tyranny, his savage temper, his reckless munificence, and his insatiable avarice.He was very stout and tall, swarthy of countenance and beardless, he spoke in a thick voice and seemed half asleep; but the more quietly he spoke the more those about him trembled.He had managed to get a wife who was a fit match for him.She was a gipsy by birth, goggle-eyed and hook-nosed, with a round yellow face.She was irascible and vindictive, and never gave way in anything to her husband, who almost killed her, and whose death she did not survive, though she had been for ever quarrelling with him.The son of Andrei, Piotr, Fedor’s grandfather, did not take after his father; he was a typical landowner of the steppes, rather a simpleton, loud-voiced, but slow to move, coarse but not ill-natured, hospitable and very fond of coursing with dogs.He was over thirty when he inherited from his father a property of two thousand serfs in capital condition; but he had soon dissipated it, and had partly mortgaged his estate, and demoralised his servants.All sorts of people of low position, known and unknown, came crawling like cockroaches from all parts into his spacious, warm, ill-kept halls.All this mass of people ate what they could get, but always had their fill, drank till they were drunk, and carried off what they could, praising and blessing their genial host; and their host too when he was out humour blessed his guests—for a pack of sponging toadies, but he was bored when he was without them.Piotr Andreitch’s wife was a meek-spirited creature; he had taken her from a neighbouring family by his father’s choice and command; her name was Anna Pavlovna.She never interfered in anything, welcomed guests cordially, and readily paid visits herself, though being powdered, she used to declare, would be the death of her.“They put,” she used to say in her old age, “a fox’s brush on your head, comb all the hair up over it, smear it with grease, and dust it over with flour, and stick it up with iron pins,—there’s no washing it off afterwards; but to pay visits without powder was quite impossible—people would be offended.Ah, it was a torture!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她喜欢骑着快马去兜风，乐意从早到晚地打牌。每当他丈夫走近牌桌时，她就会把记录的输赢钱数藏在一只手下。不过，她把所有的嫁妆和财产都完全交由丈夫支配。她为他生有两个孩子，一个儿子伊凡，也就是费奥多尔的父亲，另一个是女儿格拉菲拉。伊凡不是在自己家里长大的，他与一个富有的老姨妈，即从未出嫁的库宾斯卡娅公爵小姐一起住。她已经指定他为继承人（要不是为了这个原因，他的父亲也不会让他去）。她把他打扮得像个洋娃娃，给他请了各种不同的老师，还请一个家庭教师专门负责照管他。这个家庭教师是个法国人，以前是个牧师，也是让·雅克·卢梭的信徒。他叫库尔坦·德·沃塞勒先生，是个阴险狡诈、诡计多端的人——正如她所说，是移民中的精华。她在将近七十岁时嫁给了这个“精华”，还把自己的所有财产都转到他了的名下。此后不久，她涂着胭脂，浑身散发着浓郁的黎塞留式的香水味，身边围着几条体形娇弱的灵缇犬和几只声音尖细的鹦鹉，以及年轻的黑奴。她最后死在了一张路易十五时代的弯型丝绸长沙发床上，手里还攥着帕蒂托制作的搪瓷的鼻烟壶——她死了，也已经被丈夫遗弃了。那个曲意逢迎的库尔坦先生已经带着她的钱，溜回巴黎去了。这个出人意料的打击（我们指的是公爵小姐的婚姻，而不是她的去世）降临到伊凡身上的时候，他才刚刚二十岁。他不愿意再呆在姨妈家里了。在那里，他发现自己从一位富有的继承人一下子变成了一个穷亲戚。在彼得斯堡，他在其中长大成人的那个上流社会把他拒之门外。他觉得在政府部门从低级职位干起，工作艰苦，而且前途渺茫，所以很是厌恶——这些事情都发生在亚历山大大帝执政初期。他很不情愿，却不得不回到乡下父亲那里。对他而言，父母的居所太肮脏、太可怜、太悲惨了！乡下生活的沉闷呆滞和肮脏处处让他感到恼火。他觉得百无聊赖，日渐憔悴下去。并且，家里除了他母亲外，其他人看他的眼光都不友善。他的父亲不喜欢他那城里人的举止、他的燕尾服、他那带有皱边领的衬衫、他的书籍、他的长笛、他的吹毛求疵——他的父亲从他的苛求中感到了他对周围环境的厌恶，这种感觉也并非全无道理。他总是对他的儿子牢骚满腹。“这儿没有一点，”他常常说，“合他的意。他坐在餐桌旁时烦躁不安，不吃不喝。他也受不了房间里的热气和气味。看到别人喝醉了，他也不高兴，在他面前没人敢打架。他也不愿意去政府当差，你看看他，身体虚弱。呸，没出息的家伙！这全都是因为他满脑子里都是伏尔泰的思想。”这老头特别厌恶伏尔泰和“狂热者”狄德罗，尽管对于他们的著作，他一个字都没有读过，读书可不关他的事。彼得·安德烈倒是没说错，他儿子的脑子里确实装满了狄德罗和伏尔泰，并且还不只是他们俩，还有卢梭、爱尔维修以及其他类似的作家——不过也只是在脑子里而已。那个学识渊博、曾经担任过伊凡·彼得罗维奇的家庭教师的退职牧师喜欢把十八世纪的至理名言都灌输给他的学生，而学生的脑子里也只是装满了这些真知灼见。但是这些智慧并没有与他的血液融为一体，也没有渗入到他的灵魂中，更没有形成坚固的信念……不过，也难怪，时至今日，我们还没有获得这些信念，难道还要奢望一个五十年前的青年拥有这些吗？经常来他父亲家里的客人们也因为伊凡·彼得罗维奇的在场而感到压抑不安。他憎恶他们，他们害怕他。连那个大他十二岁的姐姐格拉菲拉也根本和他处不来。这位格拉菲拉像个怪物：她相貌丑陋，弯腰驼背，身材削瘦，一双严厉的眼睛瞪得大大的，薄薄的嘴唇紧闭着。她的面貌、声音和那慌张生硬的动作，都像她的祖母，那个吉卜赛人，也就是安德烈的妻子。她性格固执，喜欢发号施令，对于婚姻这个话题听都不愿听。伊凡·彼得罗维奇的归来并不合她的心意。库宾斯卡娅公爵小姐留他跟自己住在一起的时候，格拉菲拉还希望能得到她父亲至少一半的财产。在贪财这点，格拉菲拉也像她的祖母。并且，格拉菲拉还嫉妒她的弟弟，因为他受到过那么好的教育，还能讲一口带有巴黎口音的法语，而她自己连“日安”和“你好”这两个法语单词都发不准。确实，她的父母不懂一点儿法语。不过，这并不会给她带来任何安慰。伊凡·彼得罗维奇对自己的不幸和无所事事也无计可施。他在乡下呆了将近一年了，可是这一年对他而言简直像十年那么长。只有跟母亲在一起聊天时，他才能找到些安慰。他会在她那低矮的房间里一坐几个小时，一边吃着果酱，一边倾听这位善良单纯的女士跟他闲聊。碰巧，安娜·巴甫洛芙娜的女仆中有一位非常漂亮的姑娘。她名叫玛兰尼娅，眼睛清澈温柔，面容精致，为人谦逊聪明。伊凡·彼得罗维奇对她一见钟情，他爱上了她，爱上了她羞怯的举动、她娇羞的回答、她温和的声音和温柔的微笑。他觉得她一天比一天更甜美可爱。她全心全意地爱着伊凡·彼得罗维奇，就像只有俄国姑娘才能做到的献身那样，她把自己献给了他。在乡村地主家里，没有什么秘密能保持得长久。不久，年轻主子和玛兰尼娅的恋情已经人尽皆知了，这个流言最后传到了彼得·安德烈的耳朵里。要是在别的情况下，他很可能对这样一件无关紧要的事置之不理，可他早就对儿子心怀怨气，现在正高兴有机会来羞辱一下这个城市里长大的自以为有才的花花公子。一场风波闹得沸沸扬扬的。玛兰尼娅被关进了餐具室，伊凡·彼得罗维奇被叫去见父亲。安娜·巴甫洛芙娜听到吵闹声，也赶紧跑了过来。她试图平息她丈夫的怒火，可是彼得·安德烈伊奇什么也听不下去。他像只鹰一样猛扑向儿子，斥责他伤风败俗、道貌岸然、亵渎上帝。他还趁机把对库宾斯卡娅公爵小姐压抑已久的满腹怨恨都发泄到他的身上，还毫无保留地把各种难听的话都骂了出来。起初，伊凡·彼得罗维奇还默默隐忍着，直到他父亲用羞辱性的惩罚威胁他时，他忍无可忍了。“啊，”他心想，“明知山有虎，我偏向虎山行。我要让你们所有人都大吃一惊，狂人狄德罗要登场了！”所以，尽管他内心害怕，四肢颤抖，但还是用镇定和平静的声音告诉父亲用不着骂他伤风败俗。虽然他不打算为自己的过错辩解，可他愿意设法弥补，他感到自己摆脱了所有偏见，所以更——事实也是这样——愿意娶玛兰尼娅为妻。伊凡·彼得罗维奇说的这番话毋庸置疑达到了其目的。他把彼得·安德烈惊得目瞪口呆，一时间哑口无言。不过，他很快恢复过来。他像往常一样身穿松鼠皮晨袍，赤脚穿着拖鞋，此刻挥着拳头就朝伊凡·彼得罗维奇猛扑过来。那天早上，儿子好像是故意似的，梳着提图斯式发型，穿着一件崭新的蓝色英国式外套、一双带小流苏的长筒靴和一条时髦的紧身鹿皮裤子。安娜·巴甫洛芙娜双手捂脸，声嘶力竭地尖叫起来。她的儿子在整个家里到处乱跑，猛然冲进院子，跑进菜园，又跑进娱乐场，又飞奔到路上。他一直狂奔不停，头也不回，直到最后他听不到身后父亲那沉重的脚步声和费力的叫嚷声“你给我站住！要不然我要诅咒你了！”伊凡·彼得罗维奇躲到了附近一个小地主家里，而彼得·安德烈伊奇回到家里时，累得筋疲力尽、汗流浃背。他没等喘口气，就立即宣布收回对儿子的祝福，剥夺他的继承权，还下令把他所有的邪书都烧掉，并让人把女仆玛兰尼娅立即送到一个遥远的村子里。有几个好心人找到了伊凡·彼得罗维奇，并且把发生的一切都告诉了他。他觉得自己蒙羞受辱，气得发狂，发誓要报复他的父亲。当天夜里，他等待运走玛兰尼娅的农车，强行抢走了她，带着她骑马飞奔到离这儿最近的一座城市，和她结了婚。一个邻居资助了他，这个人是位善良的退役海军军官，经常喝得烂醉如泥。他热衷于任何一种——用他的话说——浪漫故事。</td>
		<td class="en">She liked being driven with fast-trotting horses, and was ready to play cards from morning till evening, and would always keep the score of the pennies she had lost or won hidden under her hand when her husband came near the card-table; but all her dowry, her whole fortune, she had put absolutely at his disposal.She bore him two children, a son Ivan, the father of Fedor, and a daughter Glafira.Ivan was not brought up at home, but lived with a rich old maiden aunt, the Princess Kubensky; she had fixed on him for her heir (but for that his father would not have let him go).She dressed him up like a doll, engaged all kinds of teachers for him, and put him in charge of a tutor, a Frenchman, who had been an abbe, a pupil of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a certain M. Courtin de Vaucelles, a subtle and wily intriguer—the very, as she expressed it, fine fleur of emigration—and finished at almost seventy years old by marrying this “fine fleur,” and making over all her property to him.Soon afterwards, covered with rouge, and redolent of perfume a la Richelieu, surrounded by negro boys, delicate-shaped greyhounds and shrieking parrots, she died on a crooked silken divan of the time of Louis XV., with an enamelled snuff-box of Petitot’s workmanship in her hand—and died, deserted by her husband; the insinuating M. Courtin had preferred to remove to Paris with her money.Ivan had only reached his twentieth year when this unexpected blow (we mean the princess’s marriage, not her death) fell upon him; he did not care to stay in his aunt’s house, where he found himself suddenly transformed from a wealthy heir to a poor relation; the society in Petersburg in which he had grown up was closed to him; he felt an aversion for entering the government service in the lower grades, with nothing but hard work and obscurity before him,—this was at the very beginning of the reign of the Emperor Alexander.He was obliged reluctantly to return to the country to his father.How squalid, poor, and wretched his parents’ home seemed to him!The stagnation and sordidness of life in the country offended him at every step.He was consumed with ennui.Moreover, every one in the house, except his mother, looked at him with unfriendly eyes.His father did not like his town manners, his swallow-tail coats, his frilled shirt-fronts, his books, his flute, his fastidious ways, in which he detected—not incorrectly—a disgust for his surroundings; he was for ever complaining and grumbling at his son.“Nothing here,” he used to say, “is to his taste; at table he is all in a fret, and doesn’t eat; he can’t bear the heat and close smell of the room; the sight of folks drunk upsets him, one daren’t beat any one before him; he doesn’t want to go into the government service; he’s weakly, as you see, in health; fie upon him, the milksop!And all this because he’s got his head full of Voltaire.”The old man had a special dislike to Voltaire, and the “fanatic” Diderot, though he had not read a word of their words; reading was not in his line.Piotr Andreitch was not mistaken; his son’s head for that matter was indeed full of both Diderot and Voltaire, and not only of them alone, of Rousseau too, and Helvetius, and many other writers of the same kind—but they were in his head only.The retired abbe and encyclopedist who had been Ivan Petrovitch’s tutor had taken pleasure in pouring all the wisdom of the eighteenth century into his pupil, and he was simply brimming over with it; it was there in him, but without mixing in his blood, nor penetrating to his soul, nor shaping itself in any firm convictions.... But, indeed, could one expect convictions from a young man of fifty years ago, when even at the present day we have not succeeded in attaining them?The guests, too, who frequented his father’s house, were oppressed by Ivan Petrovitch’s presence; he regarded them with loathing, they were afraid of him; and with his sister Glafira, who was twelve years older than he, he could not get on at all.This Glafira was a strange creature; she was ugly, crooked, and spare, with severe, wide-open eyes, and thin compressed lips.In her face, her voice, and her quick angular movements, she took after her grandmother, the gipsy, Andrei’s wife.Obstinate and fond of power, she would not even hear of marriage.The return of Ivan Petrovitch did not fit in with her plans; while the Princess Kubensky kept him with her, she had hoped to receive at least half of her father’s estate; in her avarice, too, she was like her grandmother.Besides, Glafira envied her brother, he was so well educated, spoke such good French with a Parisian accent, while she was scarcely able to pronounce “bon jour” or “comment vous portez-vous.”To be sure, her parents did not know any French, but that was no comfort to her.Ivan Petrovitch did not know what to do with himself for wretchedness and ennui; he had spent hardly a year in the country, but that year seemed to him as long as ten.The only consolation he could find was in talking to his mother, and he would sit for whole hours in her low-pitched rooms, listening to the good woman’s simple-hearted prattle, and eating preserves.It so happened that among Anna Pavlovna’s maids there was one very pretty girl with clear soft eyes and refined features, Malanya by name, an modest intelligent creature.She took his fancy at first sight, and he fell in love with her: he fell in love with her timid movements, her bashful answers, her gentle voice and gentle smile; every day she seemed sweeter to him.And she became devoted to Ivan Petrovitch with all the strength of her soul, as none but Russian girls can be devoted—and she gave herself to him.In the large household of a country squire nothing can long be kept a secret; soon every one knew of the love between the young master and Malanya; the gossip even reached the ears of Piotr Andreitch himself.Under other circumstances, he would probably have paid no attention to a matter of so little importance, but he had long had a grudge against his son, and was delighted at an opportunity of humiliating the town-bred wit and dandy.A storm of fuss and clamour was raised; Malanya was locked up in the pantry, Ivan Petrovitch was summoned into his father’s presence.Anna Pavlovna too ran up at the hubbub.She began trying to pacify her husband, but Piotr Andreitch would hear nothing.He pounced down like a hawk on his son, reproached him with immorality, with godlessness, with hypocrisy; he took the opportunity to vent on him all the wrath against the Princess Kubensky that had been simmering within him, and lavished abusive epithets upon him.At first Ivan Petrovitch was silent and held himself in, but when his father thought to fit to threaten him with a shameful punishment he could endure it no longer.“Ah,” he thought, “the fanatic Diderot is brought out again, then I will take the bull by the horns, I will astonish you all.”And thereupon with a calm and even voice, though quaking inwardly in every limb, Ivan Petrovitch declared to his father, that there was no need to reproach him with immorality; that though he did not intend to justify his fault he was ready to make amends for it, the more willingly as he felt himself to be superior to every kind of prejudice—and in fact—was ready to marry Malanya.In uttering these words Ivan Petrovitch did undoubtedly attain his object; he so astonished Piotr Andreitch that the latter stood open-eyed, and was struck dumb for a moment; but instantly he came to himself, and just as he was, in a dressing-gown bordered with squirrel fur and slippers on his bare feet, he flew at Ivan Petrovitch with his fists.The latter, as though by design, had that morning arranged his locks a la Titus, and put on a new English coat of a blue colour, high boots with little tassels and very tight modish buckskin breeches.Anna Pavlovna shrieked with all her might and covered her face with her hands; but her son ran over the whole house, dashed out into the courtyard, rushed into the kitchen-garden, into the pleasure-grounds, and flew across into the road, and kept running without looking round till at last he ceased to hear the heavy tramp of his father’s steps behind him and his shouts, jerked out with effort, “Stop you scoundrel!” he cried, “stop! or I will curse you!”Ivan Petrovitch took refuge with a neighbour, a small landowner, and Piotr Andreitch returned home worn out and perspiring, and without taking breath, announced that he should deprive his son of his blessing and inheritance, gave orders that all his foolish books should be burnt, and that the girl Malanya should be sent to a distant village without loss of time.Some kind-hearted people found out Ivan Petrovitch and let him know everything.Humiliated and driven to fury, he vowed he would be revenged on his father, and the same night lay in wait for the peasant’s cart in which Malanya was being driven away, carried her off by force, galloped off to the nearest town with her and married her.He was supplied with money by the neighbour, a good-natured retired marine officer, a confirmed tippler, who took an intense delight in every kind of—as he expressed it—romantic story.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Ivan Petrovitch returned to Russia an Anglomaniac.His short-cropped hair, his starched shirt-front, his long-skirted pea-green overcoat with its multitude of capes, the sour expression of his face, something abrupt and at the same time indifferent in his behaviour, his way of speaking through his teeth, his sudden wooden laugh, the absence of smiles, his exclusively political or politic-economical conversation, his passion for roast beef and port wine—everything about him breathed, so to speak, of Great Britain.But, marvelous to relate, while he had been transformed into an Anglomaniac, Ivan Petrovitch had at the same time become a patriot, at least he called himself a patriot, though he knew Russia little, had not retained a single Russian habit, and expressed himself in Russian rather queerly; in ordinary conversation, his language was spiritless and inanimate and constantly interspersed with Gallicisms.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伊凡·彼得罗维奇带回了一些有关政府行政管理和改革的计划文稿，他对所闻所见都不满——尤其是制度的缺乏问题。刚见到姐姐，他一开口就宣布，他决心进行彻底的改革，从今以后，跟他有关系的一切都要按照新的制度运行。格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜什么也没回答，她只是咬牙切齿地暗自思忖：“那我怎么办啊？”不过，和弟弟、侄子回到乡下以后，她的担心很快就消失得无影无踪了。家里的确发生了一些变化：懒汉和寄生虫立即被扫地出门，这使得其中的两个老太婆吃了不少苦头，她们俩一个是瞎子，另一个是病恹恹的瘫子，还有一个年老体弱、叶卡捷琳娜时期的少校，这位少校食量大得惊人，因此只给他吃黑面包和小扁豆。还发出一道命令：以前的客人一律不许再接待，取而代之的是一个头发浅黄、患有淋巴结核病的男爵，这个人是一个远邻，受过良好教育，不过头脑愚笨。家里添置了从莫斯科运来的新家具，初次使用了痰盂、小钟、盥洗台，上早餐的方式也跟以前大不相同，伏特加和甜酒被外国酒给取代了，仆人们的衣服也换成了新的工作服，家族纹章上也又加了一句箴言：守法既是美德……实际上，格拉菲拉手里的大权丝毫未减：所有的采购、花销都仍然由她说了算。从国外带来的那个阿尔萨斯人管家，曾试图和她争权夺位，尽管他有主人的庇护，结果却连自己的位子都没保住。说到家里的事务和农庄的管理，格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜也都要插手料理，虽然伊凡·彼得罗维奇曾多次表示过自己的意向：给这混乱的局面注入新的活力，但是一切仍然是老样子，只不过有些地方的地租增加了，女主人更加严厉了，而且不准农民们直接去找伊凡·彼得罗维奇。这个爱国主义者早都对他的同胞们嗤之以鼻。伊凡·彼得罗维奇的新政策只在费佳身上得以全部推行，他的教育真正经过了“彻底改革”：他的教育唯有父亲一个人全权负责。</td>
		<td class="en">Ivan Petrovitch brought with him a few schemes in manuscript, relating to the administration and reform of the government; he was much displeased with everything he saw; the lack of system especially aroused his spleen.On his meeting with his sister, at the first word he announced to her that he was determined to introduce radical reforms, that henceforth everything to do with him would be on a different system.Glafira Petrovna made no reply to Ivan Petrovitch; she only ground her teeth and thought: “Where am I to take refuge?”After she was back in the country, however, with her brother and nephew, her fears were soon set at rest.In the house, certainly, some changes were made; idlers and dependants met with summary dismissal; among them two old women were made to suffer, one blind, another broken down by paralysis; and also a decrepit major of the days of Catherine, who, on account of his really abnormal appetite, was fed on nothing but black bread and lentils.The order went forth not to admit the guests of former days; they were replaced by a distant neighbour, a certain fair-haired, scrofulous baron, a very well educated and very stupid man.New furniture was brought from Moscow; spittoons were introduced, and bells and washing-stands; and breakfast began to be served in a different way; foreign wines replaced vodka and syrups; the servants were put into new livery; a motto was added to the family arms: in recto virtus...In reality, Glafira’s power suffered no diminution; the giving out and buying of stores still depended on her.The Alsatian steward, brought from abroad, tried to fight it out with her and lost his place, in spite of the master’s protection.As for the management of the house, and the administration of the estate, Glafira Petrovna had undertaken these duties also; in spite of Ivan Petrovitch’s intention,—more than once expressed—to breathe new life into this chaos, everything remained as before; only the rent was in some places raised, the mistress was more strict, and the peasants were forbidden to apply direct to Ivan Petrovitch.The patriot had already a great contempt for his fellow-countrymen.Ivan Petrovitch’s system was applied in its full force only to Fedya; his education really underwent a “radical reformation;” his father devoted himself exclusively to it.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正如前文所说，伊凡·彼得罗维奇从国外回来之前，费佳已经在格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的照管之下了。他母亲去世的时候，他还不满八岁。虽然他不是每天都能见到母亲，可还是深深地爱着她。他永远铭记着她，铭记着她那温柔却苍白的面容，铭记着她那忧郁的目光和战战兢兢的爱抚。而他隐约明白她在家里的地位，感觉到在他和她之间有一道她不敢也不能逾越的障碍。他跟父亲认生，伊凡·彼得罗维奇的确也从来不爱抚他。他的祖父有时还轻轻拍拍他的小脑袋，亲亲他的小手，不过祖父认为他是小傻瓜，还这样叫他。玛兰尼娅·谢尔盖耶芙娜死后，他的姑姑终于把他完全置于自己的控制之下了。费佳对她心生畏惧：他惧怕她那双明亮犀利的眼睛和她那刺耳的声音。他在她面前吓得不敢吭声，经常会发生这样的情况：只要他在椅子上稍微动弹一下，她就会立即斥责道：“你干嘛呢？坐着别动！”每逢星期天，他要等到弥撒结束后才被允许去玩。也就是说，她给他一本厚厚的神神秘秘的书，是马克西莫维奇·安博季克的著作，书名是《象征与图谱》。这本书中有一千幅左右令人琢磨不透的图画，配有同样多的令人琢磨不透的说明，用五种文字写成。这些图画的主要角色就是体态丰腴的裸身丘比特。其中有一幅画，题名为《番红花和彩虹》，附加的说明是：“这幅画有巨大的影响。”跟这幅画相对的另一幅画名为《口衔紫罗兰振翅而飞的苍鹭》，说明文字是：“汝熟知它们。”《爱神和添自己的毛的熊》附着的说明是：“一点一点地。”以前，费佳常常长时间地思索这些图片，一丝一毫，他都非常熟悉。有几幅图画，一直也都是那几幅，是他沉思冥想的精神食粮，常常使他坠入梦境。除了这个，他就再也没有别的娱乐了。到了要教他语言和音乐的时候，格拉菲拉就用很少的一点钱雇了一个老师。她是个瑞典人，年岁很大，没结过婚，长着一双兔子眼，法语和德语说得错误百出，钢琴弹得马马虎虎，不过黄瓜腌得倒是恰到好处。费佳和这个家庭女教师、他的姑姑和老侍女瓦西里耶芙娜一起度过了整整四年的时间。他经常捧着他的《象征与图谱》坐在角落里，一直坐在那里……低矮的屋子里弥漫着天竺葵的香气，孤独的烛光越燃越暗，有只蟋蟀单调地唧唧叫着，墙上的小挂钟好像感到不耐烦似的，急匆匆地滴滴答答响着，一只老鼠偷偷摸摸地抓咬着糊墙纸。那三个老太婆，就像命运三女神一样一言不发、迅速敏捷地拨动着她们的织针。在半明半暗的光线里，她们的手的影子一会儿快速地移动着，一会儿又在稀奇古怪地颤动着，同样稀奇古怪、半明半暗的思绪也蜂拥进入孩子的脑海里。费佳不是一个有趣的孩子。他面色相当苍白，却长得胖嘟嘟的，身形不佳，笨手笨脚——用格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的话说，他是一个彻头彻尾的农夫。要是允许他多到户外走动走动，他那苍白的面色很快就会消失不见了。尽管他经常偷懒，他学得倒是挺快的。他从来不掉泪，不过有时他那可怕的顽固劲儿突然发作起来，没人能劝得了他。周围的人，费佳没一个喜欢的……一颗从小就不会爱人的心真是悲哀呀！</td>
		<td class="en">Until Ivan Petrovitch’s return from abroad, Fedya was, as already related, in the hands of Glafira Petrovna.He was not eight years old when his mother died; he did not see her every day, and loved her passionately; the memory of her, of her pale and gentle face, of her dejected looks and timid caresses, was imprinted on his heart for ever; but he vaguely understood her position in the house; he felt that between him and her there existed a barrier which she dared not and could not break down.He was shy of his father, and, indeed, Ivan Petrovitch on his side never caressed him; his grandfather sometimes patted him on the head and gave him his hand to kiss, but he thought him and called him a little fool.After the death of Malanya Sergyevna, his aunt finally got him under her control.Fedya was afraid of her: he was afraid of her bright sharp eyes and her harsh voice; he dared not utter a sound in her presence; often, when he only moved a little in his chair, she would hiss out at once:“What are you doing? Sit still.”On Sundays, after mass, he was allowed to play, that is to say, he was given a thick book, a mysterious book, the work of a certain Maimovitch-Ambodik, entitled “Symbols and Emblems.”This book was a medley of about a thousand mostly very enigmatical pictures, and as many enigmatical interpretations of them in five languages.Cupid—naked and very puffy in the body—played a leading part in these illustrations.In one of them, under the heading, “Saffron and the Rainbow,” the interpretation appended was: “Of this, the influence is vast;” opposite another, entitled “A heron, flying with a violet in his beak,” stood the inscription: “To thee they are all known.”“Cupid and the bear licking his fur” was inscribed, “Little by little.”Fedya used to ponder over these pictures; he knew them all to the minutest details; some of them, always the same ones, used to set him dreaming, and afforded him food for meditation; he knew no other amusements. When the time came to teach him languages and music, Glafira Petrovna engaged, for next to nothing, an old maid, a Swede, with eyes like a hare’s, who spoke French and German with mistakes in every alternate word, played after a fashion on the piano, and above all, salted cucumbers to a perfection.In the society of this governess, his aunt, and the old servant maid, Vassilyevna, Fedya spent four whole years.Often he would sit in the corner with his “Emblems”; he sat there endlessly; there was a scent of geranium in the low pitched room, the solitary candle burnt dim, the cricket chirped monotonously, as though it were weary, the little clock ticked away hurriedly on the wall, a mouse scratched stealthily and gnawed at the wall-paper, and the three old women, like the Fates, swiftly and silently plied their knitting needles, the shadows raced after their hands and quivered strangely in the half darkness, and strange, half dark ideas swarmed in the child’s brain.No one would have called Fedya an interesting child; he was rather pale, but stout, clumsily built and awkward—a thorough peasant, as Glafira Petrovna said; the pallor would soon have vanished from his cheeks, if he had been allowed oftener to be in the open air.He learnt fairly quickly, though he was often lazy; he never cried, but at times he was overtaken by a fit of savage obstinacy; then no one could soften him.Fedya loved no one among those around him.... Woe to the heart that has not loved in youth!</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我首先要把他培养成一个男子汉，大丈夫。”他对格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜说，“不仅仅是个男子汉，还应该是位斯巴达勇士。”伊凡·彼得罗维奇开始执行起了他的计划，让儿子穿着苏格兰褶裥短裙。这个十二岁的男孩就得光着小腿走路，头上戴的苏格兰帽子上还插了一根羽毛。一位精通体操的年轻瑞士教师受雇，替换了那位瑞典女士。音乐课被废除了，因为他认为音乐不值得男子汉花时间学习。遵照让·雅克·卢梭的教育准则，他给儿子开设了自然科学、国际法、数学、木工手艺，还有激励骑士精神的纹章学，这些都成了这个未来的“男子汉”要致力于的课程。凌晨四点钟，他就把儿子叫醒了，立刻给儿子用冷水冲洗，接着让儿子牵着一根绳子，绕着一根高高的柱子跑。他一天只让儿子吃一顿饭，还只有一道菜，还让他骑马、射箭，利用一切便利时机让儿子以他为榜样锻炼坚强的意志。每天晚上，他都要求儿子在一个专用的本子上写下一天的生活内容和个人感想。伊凡·彼得罗维奇本人则用法语给儿子写下教导之语。他在这些教导之语中把费佳叫做“我的儿子”，还称呼他为“您”。费佳用俄语尊称父亲为“您”，却不敢在父亲面前坐下。这个“制度”把孩子搞晕了，脑子糊里糊涂的，聪明才智也受到束缚限制。不过，另一方面，这种新的生活方式对他的身体健康却颇有益处。一开始，他生了一场热病，不过很快便康复了，还变得结实、强壮起来。他的父亲为他感到自豪无比，用他自己的奇怪的术语称他为“自然之子，我的杰作”。费佳满十六岁的时候，伊凡·彼得罗维奇认为有责任给他灌输轻蔑女性的意识了。所以，这个内心羞怯的斯巴达年轻人，这个嘴上刚刚长出茸毛、精力充沛、身强体壮、浑身充溢着青春活力的人，已经在努力装出对女性漠不关心、冷淡粗鲁的样子来。</td>
		<td class="en">“I want above all to make a man, un homme, of him,” he said to Glafira Petrovna, “and not only a man, but a Spartan.”Ivan Petrovitch began carrying out his intentions by putting his son in a Scotch kilt; the twelve-year-old boy had to go about with bare knees and a plume stuck in his Scotch cap.The Swedish lady was replaced by a young Swiss tutor, who was versed in gymnastics to perfection.Music, as a pursuit unworthy of a man, was discarded.The natural sciences, international law, mathematics, carpentry, after Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s precept, and heraldry, to encourage chivalrous feelings, were what the future “man” was to be occupied with.He was waked at four o’clock in the morning, splashed at once with cold water and set to running round a high pole with a cord; he had only one meal a day, consisting of a single dish; rode on horseback; shot with a cross-bow; at every convenient opportunity he was exercised in acquiring after his parent’s example firmness of will, and every evening he inscribed in a special book an account of the day and his impressions; and Ivan Petrovitch on his side wrote him instructions in French in which he called him mon fils, and addressed him as vous.In Russian Fedya called his father thou, but did not dare to sit down in his presence.The “system” dazed the boy, confused and cramped his intellect, but his health on the other hand was benefited by the new manner of his life; at first he fell into a fever but soon recovered and began to grow stout and strong.His father was proud of him and called him in his strange jargon “a child of nature, my creation.”When Fedya had reached his sixteenth year, Ivan Petrovitch thought it his duty in good time to instil into him a contempt for the female sex; and the young Spartan, with timidity in his heart and the first down on his lip, full of sap and strength and young blood, already tried to seem indifferent, cold, and rude.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >光阴飞逝。这一年内，伊凡·彼得罗维奇大部分时间都呆在拉夫里基庄园（这是他世袭的主要庄园）。冬天，他常常独自一人到莫斯科去，住在一家小客栈，殷勤地去俱乐部，在人家的客厅里侃侃而谈自己的各种计划。他那亲英的派头、对政治的爱好，以及满腹牢骚的倾向在他的行为举止中表现得淋漓尽致。随着1825年的到来，很多不幸也接踵而至。伊凡·彼得罗维奇的密友和结交之人都遭受着痛苦的考验。伊凡·彼得罗维奇急忙回到乡下，躲在家里，闭门不出。又过了一年，伊凡·彼得罗维奇突然变得虚弱无力、衰弱多病起来，健康状况开始急剧下降。他这个自由思想家竟然开始去教堂，开始让牧师为他做祷告了；他这个已经被西欧化了的人却开始洗起蒸气浴来，下午两点钟吃午餐，晚上九点钟休息，听到老管家唠叨的说话声就能打盹儿；他这位有着自己政治观的人竟然烧掉了他所有的策划和所有的信函，见了省长就战战栗栗，听到县警察局长叹气就忧心忡忡；他这位有铁一般意志的男子汉，竟然会因为齿龈有点溃疡或给他端来的汤是凉的而抽抽搭搭或发起牢骚。格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜又掌握了家里的大权。工头、管家、普通农夫又开始从后门进进出出，来向这个“老巫婆”报告，“老巫婆”是仆人们给她起的外号。伊凡·彼得罗维奇的转变让他的儿子大吃一惊，对他影响颇大。他现在已经十九岁了，开始思考事情，并且力求从如重负一样的束缚中解放出来。他甚至在此之前就发现父亲言行有点不一，发现父亲那空泛的自由主义理论和他的心胸狭窄、冷酷专制之间大相径庭。不过，父亲的精神崩溃得如此彻底，还是完全出乎他的意料之外。他那根深蒂固的利己主义现在是原形毕露了。年轻的拉夫列茨基已经准备好前去莫斯科上大学预科班。这时，一个出其不意的新灾难降临在了伊凡·彼得罗维奇身上。他的眼睛在一天之内瞎了，并且毫无治愈的希望。</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile time was passing.Ivan Petrovitch spent the great part of the year in Lavriky (that was the name of the principal estate inherited from his ancestors).But in the winter he used to go to Moscow alone; there he stayed at a tavern, diligently visited the club, made speeches and developed his plans in drawing-rooms, and in his behaviour was more than ever Anglomaniac, grumbling and political.But the year 1825 came and brought much sorrow.Intimate friends and acquaintances of Ivan Petrovitch underwent painful experiences.Ivan Petrovitch made haste to withdraw into the country and shut himself up in his house.Another year passed by, and suddenly Ivan Petrovitch grew feeble, and ailing; his health began to break up.He, the free-thinker, began to go to church and have prayers put up for him; he, the European, began to sit in steam-baths, to dine at two o’clock, to go to bed at nine, and to doze off to the sound of the chatter of the old steward; he, the man of political ideas, burnt all his schemes, all his correspondence, trembled before the governor, and was uneasy at the sigh of the police-captain; he, the man of iron will, whimpered and complained, when he had a gumboil or when they gave him a plate of cold soup.Glafira Petrovna again took control of everything in the house; once more the overseers, bailiffs and simple peasants began to come to the back stairs to speak to the “old witch,” as the servants called her.The change in Ivan Petrovitch produced a powerful impression on his son.He had now reached his nineteenth year, and had begun to reflect and to emancipate himself from the hand that pressed like a weight upon him.Even before this time he had observed a little discrepancy between his father’s words and deeds, between his wide liberal theories and his harsh petty despotism; but he had not expected such a complete breakdown.His confirmed egoism was patent now in everything.Young Lavretsky was getting ready to go to Moscow, to prepare for the university, when a new unexpected calamity overtook Ivan Petrovitch; he became blind, and hopelessly blind, in one day.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">After burying his father and intrusting to the unchanged Glafira Petrovna the management of his estate and superintendence of his bailiffs, young Lavretsky went to Moscow, whither he felt drawn by a vague but strong attraction.He recognised the defects of his education, and formed the resolution, as far as possible, to regain lost ground.In the last five years he had read much and seen something; he had many stray ideas in his head; any professor might have envied some of his acquirements, but at the same time he did not know much that every schoolboy would have learnt long ago.Lavretsky was aware of his limitations; he was secretly conscious of being eccentric.The Anglomaniac had done his son an ill turn; his whimsical education had produced its fruits.For long years he had submitted unquestioningly to his father; when at last he began to see through him, the evil was already done, his habits were deeply-rooted.He could not get on with people; at twenty-three years old, with an unquenchable thirst for love in his shy heart, he had never yet dared to look one woman in the face.With his intellect, clear and sound, but somewhat heavy, with his tendencies to obstinacy, contemplation, and indolence he ought from his earliest years to have been thrown into the stream of life, and he had been kept instead in artificial seclusion.And now the magic circle was broken, but he continued to remain within it, prisoned and pent up within himself.It was ridiculous at his age to put on a student’s dress, but he was not afraid of ridicule; his Spartan education had at least the good effect of developing in him a contempt for the opinion of others, and he put on, without embarrassment, the academical uniform.He entered the section of physics and mathematics.Robust, rosy-cheeked, bearded, and taciturn, he produced a strange impression on his companions; they did not suspect that this austere man, who came so punctually to the lectures in a wide village sledge with a pair of horses, was inwardly almost a child.He appeared to them to be a queer kind of pedant; they did not care for him, and made no overtures to him, and he avoided them.During the first two years he spent in the university, he only made acquaintance with one student, from whom he took lessons in Latin.This student Mihalevitch by name, an enthusiast and a poet, who loved Lavretsky sincerely, by chance became the means of bringing about an important change in his destiny.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一次，他在剧院——当时，莫恰洛夫正处于名声鼎盛时期，他的演出拉夫列茨基一次也没有错过——前端的包厢里看到一位年轻的姑娘。虽然任何一位女性从他那冷漠的身旁经过时，他的心都会剧烈地跳动，但还是第一次跳得这么厉害。那位姑娘倾斜着身体，手肘架在包厢的天鹅绒扶手上，静静地坐着。她那椭圆形的脸蛋有些黑，但很招人喜欢，脸上处处洋溢着青春活力。她美丽的眉毛下那炯炯有神的眼睛温柔专注的凝视中、表情丰富的嘴唇上掠过的微笑中，还有她的头、双手和颈部的姿态中无一不显示出她微妙的聪慧。她衣着华丽精致。她身旁坐着一位四十五岁左右的女人，这个女人的脸又黄又皱，牙齿已经掉光了。她戴着一个低领口的黑色头饰，毫无表情却专注入神的脸上露出一丝笑容。在包厢更里面一些可以看到一位上了年纪的男人。他身穿一件宽大的长外套，脖子上系着一个高高的领结，一双小眼睛里流露出沉闷无神、高傲自大、阿谀奉承、疑心重重的神情。他唇上的小胡子和络腮胡子都染过色了，大大的额头没有什么特殊含义，双颊皱纹纵横。从这些特征来看，他是一位退伍的将军。拉夫列茨基目不转睛地盯着那位让他产生深刻印象的姑娘看。突然，包厢的门开了，米哈列维奇进去了。这个人几乎是拉夫列茨基在莫斯科唯一的熟人，这人在唯一一位吸引了他全部注意力的姑娘身边出现，对他而言，即奇妙又别有深意。他继续注视着那个包厢，发现包厢里的每个人对待米哈列维奇，就像对待老朋友那样。舞台上的演出再也引不起拉夫列茨基的兴趣，包括莫恰洛夫，尽管他那晚的表演“异常精彩”，也没有给他留下什么印象。舞台上正演到感人至深的一幕时，拉夫列茨基情不自禁地瞅了瞅他的美人：她的身子向前倾斜着，他执着的凝视让她双颊绯红。她那原本凝视着舞台的眼睛慢慢地转向他，停在了他的身上。整整一夜，他的脑子里全是那双眼睛！巧妙筑起的障碍终于被打破，他浑身打颤、燥热不安。第二天，他就去找米哈列维奇了。从米哈列维奇那里，他得知那位美丽的姑娘名叫瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜·科罗宾，与她一起坐在包厢里的两位老人是她的双亲。米哈列维奇本人是一年前在莫斯科近郊的N伯爵家里当家庭教师时认识他们的。说到瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜时，这位热心人对她倍加赞赏。“我的老兄啊”，他用他那独特的动听又急切的嗓音喊道，“那位姑娘可了不起呢，她可是个天才，一个名副其实的艺术家，人也非常善良。”他从拉夫列茨基的探询中，注意到瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜给拉夫列茨基留下的印象之深。于是，他打算把她介绍给他认识，还说他自己就像是瓦尔瓦拉的家人一样。那位将军实际上并不是一位高傲自大的人，那位母亲也愚笨得都不敢对一只家鹅吆喝一声。拉夫列茨基羞红了脸，咕咕哝哝说了几句话，也没让人听懂，就匆匆跑开了。整整五天，他都在和自己的怯懦作斗争。到了第六天，这位年轻的斯巴达人穿上了崭新的制服，对米哈列维奇言听计从了。而米哈列维奇自己伺候自己，只是梳了一下头发，两人就一道动身前往科罗宾家了。</td>
		<td class="en">One day at the theatre—Motchalov was then at the height of his fame and Lavretsky did not miss a single performance—he saw in a box in the front tier a young girl, and though no woman ever came near his grim figure without setting his heart beating, it had never beaten so violently before.The young girl sat motionless, leaning with her elbows on the velvet of the box; the light of youth and life played in every feature of her dark, oval, lovely face; subtle intelligence was expressed in the splendid eyes which gazed softly and attentively from under her fine brows, in the swift smile on her expressive lips, in the very pose of her head, her hands, her neck.She was exquisitely dressed.Beside her sat a yellow and wrinkled woman of forty-five, with a low neck, in a black headdress, with a toothless smile on her intently-preoccupied and empty face, and in the inner recesses of the box was visible an elderly man in a wide frock-coat and high cravat, with an expression of dull dignity and a kind of ingratiating distrustfulness in his little eyes, with dyed moustache and whiskers, a large meaningless forehead and wrinkled cheeks, by every sign a retired general.Lavretsky did not take his eyes off the girl who had made such an impression on him; suddenly the door of the box opened and Mihalevitch went in.The appearance of this man, almost his one acquaintance in Moscow, in the society of the one girl who was absorbing his whole attention, struck him as curious and significant.Continuing to gaze into the box, he observed that all the persons in it treated Mihalevitch as an old friend.The performance on the stage ceased to interest Lavretsky, even Motchalov, though he was that evening in his “best form,” did not produce the usual impression on him.At one very pathetic part, Lavretsky involuntarily looked at his beauty: she was bending forward, her cheeks glowing under the influence of his persistent gaze, her eyes, which were fixed on the stage, slowly turned and rested on him.All night he was haunted by those eyes.The skillfully constructed barriers were broken down at last; he was in a shiver and a fever, and the next day he went to Mihalevitch.From him he learnt that the name of the beauty was Varvara Pavlovna Korobyin; that the old people sitting with her in the box were her father and mother; and that he, Mihalevitch, had become acquainted with them a year before, while he was staying at Count N.’s, in the position of a tutor, near Moscow.The enthusiast spoke in rapturous praise of Varvara Pavlovna.“My dear fellow,” he exclaimed with the impetuous ring in his voice peculiar to him, “that girl is a marvelous creature, a genius, an artist in the true sense of the word, and she is very good too.”Noticing from Lavretsky’s inquiries the impression Varvara Pavlovna had made on him, he himself proposed to introduce him to her, adding that he was like one of the family with them; that the general was not at all proud, and the mother was so stupid she could not say “Bo” to a goose.Lavretsky blushed, muttered something unintelligible, and ran away.For five whole days he was struggling with his timidity; on the sixth day the young Spartan got into a new uniform and placed himself at Mihalevitch’s disposal.The latter being his own valet, confined himself to combing his hair—and both betook themselves to the Korobyins.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜的父亲巴维尔·彼得罗维奇·科罗宾是一位退伍的少将，一生都在彼得斯堡服役。他年轻时是一个颇有名气的跳舞高手，也是一个非常出色的训练军官。由于家境贫寒，他只能在两三个不起眼的将军手下当副官，娶了其中一个将军的女儿为妻，得到了大约两万五千卢布的嫁妆。他对军事纪律了如指掌，对军队作战演习的研究也颇为精辟透彻，经过二十五年的兢兢业业、勤恳工作后，最终获得了将军军衔，掌管一个军团。这时他理应放松下来，从容淡定地巩固自己的经济地位。他原本也是这样打算的，可是他的事情办得却有些欠缺谨慎：他想出了一种挪用公款投机买卖的新方法——这个方法似乎妙不可言——但是他在适当的地方却没打点好关系，结果别人把他告发了，酿成了一件很不光彩、丢人现眼的丑闻。将军好不容易才从这件丑闻中摆脱出来，不过他的前程也就此断送了，有人劝他干脆退役算了。他在彼得斯堡闲呆了两年光景，希望能碰上一个轻松愉快的文职空缺，但却没碰到这样轻松的差事。他的女儿这时已经毕业了，家里的花销也在与日俱增。已经听由天命的他决定迁往莫斯科，以便降低生活支出，在老马厩街租了一件狭小低矮的房屋，在屋顶上挂了一个七英尺长的盾形族徽，就这样凭着每年2750卢布的收入开始了退役将军的生活。莫斯科是一个热情好客的城市，非常乐意迎接所有流落至此的来客，对将军们更是偏爱有加。没过多久，巴维尔·彼得罗维奇那虽然笨重却不失军人仪态的身影就出现在莫斯科一些最豪华的客厅里。那群面色苍白、百无聊赖、在舞会进行时经常闷闷不乐地围着牌桌转的年轻人，也开始熟悉他那光秃秃的后脑勺和那一绺绺染过色的头发，还有他那戴在乌黑亮丽的领结上的脏兮兮的圣安娜勋章绶带了。巴维尔·彼得罗维奇深谙在社交场合立足的策略：他少言寡语，不过依旧照着老习惯，给人屈尊俯就的感觉——当然，他在跟比他权高位尊的人说起话来的时候并不是这个样子。他打起牌来谨小慎微，在家里的时候，饭吃得并不多，但是外出参加宴会时食量可以顶得上六个人。关于他的妻子，几乎没什么可说的。她名叫卡里奥帕·卡尔洛芙娜。她的左眼老是眼泪汪汪的，所以卡里奥帕·卡尔洛芙娜（必须得附上一句，她是德国人的后裔）认为自己是个多愁善感的女人。她总是处于紧张不安、焦虑烦躁的状态之中，好像营养不良似的，身穿紧身的天鹅绒连衣裙，头戴一顶女帽，胳臂上戴着一副早已失去光泽的空心手镯。巴维尔·彼得罗维奇和卡里奥帕·卡尔洛芙娜只有一个女儿，也就是瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜，她从寄宿学校毕业的时候才刚刚满十七岁，在那所学校里，如果说她不算最漂亮的女生的话，那至少可以认为她是最聪明伶俐的学生，也是最有才华的音乐家，而且她还在那儿得过奖章。拉夫列茨基第一次见到她的时候，她还不到十九岁。</td>
		<td class="en">Varvara Pavlovna’s father, Pavel Petrovitch Korobyin, a retired general-major, had spent his whole time on duty in Petersburg.He had had the reputation in his youth of a good dancer and driller.Through poverty, he had served as adjutant to two or three generals of no distinction, and had married the daughter of one of them with a dowry of twenty-five thousand roubles.He mastered all the science of military discipline and manoeuvres to the minutest niceties, he went on in harness, till at last, after twenty-five years’ service, he received the rank of a general and the command of a regiment.Then he might have relaxed his efforts and have quietly secured his pecuniary position.Indeed this was what he reckoned upon doing, but he managed things a little incautiously. He devised a new method of speculating with public funds—the method seemed an excellent one in itself—but he neglected to bribe in the right place, and was consequently informed against, and a more than unpleasant, a disgraceful scandal followed.The general got out of the affair somehow, but his career was ruined; he was advised to retire from active duty.For two years he lingered on in Petersburg, hoping to drop into some snug berth in the civil service, but no such snug berth came in his way.His daughter had left school, his expenses were increasing every day.Resigning himself to his fate, he decided to remove to Moscow for the sake of the greater cheapness of living, and took a tiny low-pitched house in the Old Stables Road, with a coat of arms seven feet long on the roof, and there began the life of a retired general at Moscow on an income of 2750 roubles a year.Moscow is a hospitable city, ready to welcome all stray comers, generals by preference.Pavel Petrovitch’s heavy figure, which was not quite devoid of martial dignity, however, soon began to be seen in the best drawing-rooms in Moscow.His bald head with its tufts of dyed hair, and the soiled ribbon of the Order of St. Anne which he wore over a cravat of the colour of a raven’s wing, began to be familiar to all the pale and listless young men who hang morosely about the card-tables while dancing is going on.Pavel Petrovitch knew how to gain a footing in society; he spoke little, but from old habit, condescendingly—though, of course, not when he was talking to persons of a higher rank than his own.He played cards carefully; ate moderately at home, but consumed enough for six at parties.Of his wife there is scarcely anything to be said.Her name was Kalliopa Karlovna.There was always a tear in her left eye, on the strength of which Kalliopa Karlovna (she was, one must add, of German extraction) considered herself a woman of great sensibility.She was always in a state of nervous agitation, seemed as though she were ill-nourished, and wore a tight velvet dress, a cap, and tarnished hollow bracelets.The only daughter of Pavel Petrovitch and Kalliopa Karlovna, Varvara Pavlovna, was only just seventeen when she left the boarding-school, in which she had been reckoned, if not the prettiest, at least the cleverest pupil and the best musician, and where she had taken a decoration.She was not yet nineteen, when Lavretsky saw her for the first time.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The young Spartan’s legs shook under him when Mihalevitch conducted him into the rather shabbily furnished drawing-room of the Korobyins, and presented him to them.But his overwhelming feeling of timidity soon disappeared.In the general the good-nature innate in all Russians was intensified by that special kind of geniality which is peculiar to all people who have done something disgraceful; the general’s lady was as it were overlooked by every one; and as for Varvara Pavlovna, she was so self-possessed and easily cordial that every one at once felt at home in her presence; besides, about all her fascinating person, her smiling eyes, her faultlessly sloping shoulders and rosy-tinged white hands, her light and yet languid movements, the very sound of her voice, slow and sweet, there was an impalpable, subtle charm, like a faint perfume, voluptuous, tender, soft, though still modest, something which is hard to translate into words, but which moved and kindled—and timidity was not the feeing it kindled.Lavretsky turned the conversation on the theater, on the performance of the previous day; she at once began herself to discuss Motchalov, and did not confine herself to sighs and interjections only, but uttered a few true observations full of feminine insight in regard to his acting.Mihalevitch spoke about music; she sat down without ceremony to the piano, and very correctly played some of Chopin’s mazurkas, which were then just coming into fashion.Dinner-time came; Lavretsky would have gone away, but they made him stay: at dinner the general regaled him with excellent Lafitte, which the general’s lackey hurried off in a street-sledge to Dupre’s to fetch.Late in the evening Lavretsky returned home; for a long while he sat without undressing, covering his eyes with his hands in the stupefaction of enchantment.It seemed to him that now for the first time he understood what made life worth living; all his previous assumptions, all his plans, all that rubbish and nonsense had vanished into nothing at once; all his soul was absorbed in one feeling, in one desire—in the desire of happiness, of possession, of love, the sweet love of a woman.at once; all his soul was absorbed in one feeling, in one desire—in the desire of happiness, of possession, of love, the sweet love of a woman.From that day he began to go often to the Korobyins.Six months later he spoke to Varvara Pavlovna, and offered her his hand.His offer was accepted; the general had long before, almost on the eve of Lavretsky’s first visit, inquired of Mihalevitch how many serfs Lavretsky owned; and indeed Varvara Pavlovna, who through the whole time of the young man’s courtship, and even at the very moment of his declaration, had preserved her customary composure and clearness of mind—Varvara Pavlovna too was very well aware that her suitor was a wealthy man; and Kalliopa Karlovna thought “meine Tochter macht eine schone Partie,” and bought herself a new cap.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，拉夫列茨基的求婚被接受了，不过有几个条件。首先，拉夫列茨基得马上离开大学：谁会跟一个学生结婚呢？再说，一个地主，一个富有的年轻人，都二十六岁了还在学校上课，难道这种想法不奇怪吗？其次，瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜要亲自定做、置办她的嫁妆，甚至未婚夫送给她的礼物也要由她亲自挑选。她有很多实际的想法，许多的爱好，特别喜爱舒适，也有本事让自己获得这种舒适生活。当婚礼刚过去，拉夫列茨基和妻子乘上她买来的舒适四轮轿式马车，前往拉夫里基的路上时，她的这种使自己过上舒适生活的能力使拉夫列茨基大吃一惊。瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜把他旅途中周围的一切都考虑、料想、事前筹备得多么细心啊！在各个温暖舒适的角落里出现了一些非常漂亮的小饰品，一些非常迷人的梳妆盒和咖啡壶，瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜在每天早上亲手煮咖啡的时候是多么开心啊！然而，那个时候的拉夫列茨基是不愿仔细观察的：他正沉浸在新婚燕尔的喜悦中，迷醉在幸福里，他像孩子似的在幸福快乐中不可自拔。他这个年轻的赫拉克勒斯确确实实单纯得像个孩子。怪不得在他眼里，他那年轻的妻子浑身都散发着迷人的魅力，怪不得她许诺能给予他无尽的幸福和神秘惬意的享受。她实际做到的比她应允的还要多。到达拉夫里基的时候正值盛夏，她觉得房子昏暗邋遢，仆人怪诞可笑，还土里土气。不过，她认为这些都无需暗示她的丈夫。要是她打算长期住在拉夫里基的话，她就会把这里的一切都改造一番，当然，首先要改造的就是这栋房子。不过要在这个人烟稀少的大草原的一隅一直呆下去，这种想法还从来没有在她的头脑里哪怕是闪现过一瞬。她住在这里，就像住在野外帐篷里一样，宽容和蔼地忍受着这里的一切不便之处，还宽容地拿它们开玩笑。玛尔法·季莫菲耶芙娜前来看她照管过的孩子，瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜非常喜欢玛尔法，可是玛尔法可不怎么喜欢瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜。这位新娶进门的女主人与格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜相处得也不好，她本来可以不和格拉菲拉打交道，可是老科罗宾想要插手管理女婿家的事情。他说，管理这么近的亲戚的家产，就算是一个将军，也不是什么有失身份尊严的事。必须补充说一点：就算是让巴维尔·彼得罗维奇去管理一个根本不认识的陌生人的产业，他也绝不会拒绝的。瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜非常巧妙地开始发起了进攻：她事先不露声色，看样子像是完全沉浸在新婚蜜月的幸福之中，乡村静谧的生活之中，音乐和书籍之中，其实她渐渐把格拉菲拉搞得到了再也忍无可忍的地步，于是一天早上，格拉菲拉好像着了魔一样，突然冲进拉夫列茨基的书房，把一串钥匙往书桌上一扔，还扬言说，她再也没能力管理家里的事情了，也不想在村子里住下去了。瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜早已用适当的方式让拉夫列茨基预先做好了心理准备，因此他当即同意了姑妈要离开的要求。这倒是出乎格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的意料之外。“很好，”她说，她的脸色变得阴沉起来，“我看得出来，我在这儿根本就是个多余！是谁把我从我祖祖辈辈的家里赶了出去，我很清楚。只不过你要记住我的话，我的侄儿：你无论在哪儿都会无家可归的，你终将一辈子在外漂泊流浪。这就是我临走前送你的最后一句话。”就在这同一天，她回她自己的小村庄去了。还没过一周，科罗宾将军就大驾光临了，他的目光和他的一举一动中都流露出欢喜而又忧郁的神情，他着手把全部家产都统统接管到了自己手里。</td>
		<td class="en">And so his offer was accepted, but on certain conditions.In the first place, Lavretsky was at once to leave the university; who would be married to a student, and what a strange idea too—how could a landowner, a rich man, at twenty-six, take lessons and be at school?Secondly, Varvara Pavlovna took upon herself the labour of ordering and purchasing her trousseau and even choosing her present from the bridegroom.She had much practical sense, a great deal of taste, and a very great love of comfort, together with a great faculty for obtaining it for herself.Lavretsky was especially struck by this faculty when, immediately after their wedding, he traveled alone with his wife in the comfortable carriage, bought by her, to Lavriky.How carefully everything with which he was surrounded had been thought of, devised and provided beforehand by Varvara Pavlovna!What charming knick-knacks appeared from various snug corners, what fascinating toilet-cases and coffee-pots, and how delightfully Varvara Pavlovna herself made the coffee in the morning!Lavretsky, however, was not at that time disposed to be observant; he was blissful, drunk with happiness; he gave himself up to it like a child.Indeed he was as innocent as a child, this young Hercules.Not in vain was the whole personality of his young wife breathing with fascination; not in vain was her promise to the senses of a mysterious luxury of untold bliss; her fulfillment was richer than her promise.When she reached Lavriky in the very height of the summer, she found the house dark and dirty, the servants absurd and old-fashioned, but she did not think it necessary even to hint at this to her husband.If she had proposed to establish herself at Lavriky, she would have changed everything in it, beginning of course with the house; but the idea of staying in that out-of-the-way corner of the steppes never entered her head for an instant; she lived as in a tent, good-temperedly putting up with all its inconveniences, and indulgently making merry over then.Marfa Timofyevna came to pay a visit to her former charge; Varvara Pavlovna liked her very much, but she did not like Varvara Pavlovna.The new mistress did not get on with Glafira Petrovna either; she would have left her in peace, but old Korobyin wanted to have a hand in the management of his son-in-law’s affairs; to superintend the property of such a near relative, he said, was not beneath the dignity of even a general.One must add that Pavel Petrovitch would not have been above managing the property even of a total stranger.Varvara Pavlovna conducted her attack very skillfully, without taking any step in advance, apparently completely absorbed in the bliss of the honeymoon, in the peaceful life of the country, in music and reading, she gradually worked Glafira up to such a point that she rushed one morning, like one possessed, into Lavretsky’s study, and throwing a bunch of keys on the table, she declared that she was not equal to undertaking the management any longer, and did not want to stop in the place.Lavretsky, having been suitably prepared beforehand, at once agreed to her departure.This Glafira Petrovna had not anticipated.“Very well,” she said, and her face darkened, “I see that I am not wanted here!I know who is driving me out of the home of my fathers.Only you mark my words, nephew; you will never make a home anywhere, you will come to be a wanderer for ever.That is my last word to you.”The same day she went away to her own little property, and in a week General Korobyin was there, and with a pleasant melancholy in his looks and movements he took the superintendence of the whole property into his hands.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the month of September, Varvara Pavlovna carried her husband off to Petersburg.She passed two winters in Petersburg (for the summer she went to stay at Tsarskoe Selo), in a splendid, light, artistically-furnished flat; they made many acquaintances among the middle and even higher ranks of society; went out and entertained a great deal, and gave the most charming dances and musical evenings.Varvara Pavlovna attracted guests as a fire attracts moths.Fedor Ivanitch did not altogether like such a frivolous life.His wife advised him to take some office under government; but from old association with his father, and also through his own ideas, he was unwilling to enter government service, still he remained in Petersburg for Varvara Pavlovna’s pleasure.He soon discovered, however, that no one hindered him from being alone; that it was not for nothing that he had the quietest and most comfortable study in all Petersburg; that his tender wife was even ready to aid him to be alone; and from that time forth all went well.He again applied himself to his own, as he considered, unfinished education; he began again to read, and even began to learn English.It was a strange sight to see his powerful, broad-shouldered figure for ever bent over his writing table, his full-bearded ruddy face half buried in the pages of a dictionary or note-book.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每天，他早晨就开始学习，接下来吃一顿有滋有味的午餐（瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜是一位无可匹敌的主妇）。到了晚上，他就进入了一个令人陶醉、灯迷香飘的世界，到处都可以见到年轻快活的面孔。这个世界的中心也就是这位精心周到的主妇——他的妻子。她生了一个儿子，这使他欣喜万分。可是，这个可怜的孩子没能活多久，在春天里死了。到了夏天，拉夫列茨基听从医生的建议，带着妻子去了国外的一处温泉疗养地。这样不幸的事情发生过后，对她而言，出去散散心是非常重要的。况且，她的健康也需要一个温暖的气候。夏天和秋天，他们是在德国和瑞士度过的。到了冬天，他们去了巴黎，人们自然会想到这一点。在巴黎，瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜就像一朵盛开的玫瑰一样。她如同在彼得斯堡一样，很快就精巧地为自己建立了一个安乐的小窝。她在巴黎的一条幽静却很时髦的街道上找到了一套非常漂亮的公寓。她为丈夫缝了一种他以前从来没有穿过的睡衣，雇了一位妖艳动人的女佣、一位手艺出众的厨娘和一位聪明机灵的男仆，还购置了一辆叫人赞不绝口的四轮马车和一架制作精良的钢琴。还没过一个星期，她已经披着一方披肩，打着一把阳伞，带着一副手套，在巴黎的街道上穿行了。那姿态跟一个土生土长的巴黎女郎没什么两样。她的身边很快就有了不少朋友。起初，来拜访她的只是一些俄国人。后来，法国人也来了。他们都是些和蔼可亲、彬彬有礼、风度翩翩、姓名悦耳的未婚男士；都能说会道，语速很快，经常对人鞠躬致礼，露出令人愉悦的笑容；个个嘴唇红润，牙齿雪白发亮——笑起来多么迷人啊！他们每个人都把自己的朋友带来。因此，从安坦大街到里尔路，美丽的拉夫列茨基夫人很快就已经无人不晓了。那些日子里（事情发生在1836年），如今这样如同蚁丘周围的蚂蚁般到处乱窜的记者和新闻通讯员还没有大量涌现。即便如此，当时在瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜家的客厅里仍然可以看到某个朱尔斯先生，这位男士相貌平平、声名狼藉、蛮横无理、卑鄙吝啬，一副随时与人决斗可又被人打败的模样。瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜对这位朱尔斯先生特别反感。但是，她接待了他，因为他为各种不同的报刊撰写文章，在这些文章里还不断地提到她。他有时候称她为拉夫列茨基夫人，有时候又称呼她为“住在Ｐ街的雍容华贵的伟大的拉夫列茨基夫人”，还向全世界几百个与拉夫列茨基夫人毫无干系的读者们介绍一番这位夫人，说她怎样魅力四射、讨人喜欢，还称她为一个充满智慧的真真正正的法国女人（一个有头脑的真真正正的法国女人），这是法国人最为崇高的赞美词。他还说她是一位才华出众的音乐家，跳起华尔兹舞来令人惊叹（的确，瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜跳华尔兹时，把所有的注意力都集中到她那轻薄迷离、盈盈舞动的裙摆上）。总而言之，他让她享誉世界，不管怎么说，这都是令人愉快的。当时，马尔斯小姐已经退出舞台，拉谢尔小姐还没有登台亮相。不过，瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜却孜孜不倦地光顾剧院。她对意大利音乐喜爱若狂，在法国戏剧院里端庄得体地打着哈欠，为多瓦尔夫人在某一部极其浪漫的情节剧中的表演而落泪。有一件大好事，李斯特曾在她家的客厅里演奏过两次，他是那么亲切友好，那么朴实直爽——真是让人着迷！冬天就在这样令人惬意的感受中过去了。暮冬时节，瓦尔瓦拉·巴甫洛芙娜甚至还被引荐去过宫廷。至于费奥多尔·伊凡内奇，他也不觉得无聊乏味，虽说有时他的生活让他感到压力重重——因为生活空虚。他经常读报，到索邦神学院和法兰西学院去听课，追踪议会里的辩论，还开始翻译一部关于水利灌溉的著名科学专著。“我可没有虚度光阴，”他心想，“这些都是大有用处的。不过，明年冬天，我必须回到俄国去，并且要开始做事了，不能有误。”他是不是清楚准确地知道要干什么事，这很难说。并且他能不能在冬天顺利回到俄国，也说不准。目前，他正打算跟妻子一同前往巴登。一件突如其来的事情打乱了他的全盘计划。</td>
		<td class="en">Every morning he set to work, then had a capital dinner (Varvara Pavlovna was unrivaled as a housekeeper), and in the evenings he entered an enchanted world of light and perfume, peopled by gay young faces, and the centre of this world was also the careful housekeeper, his wife.She rejoiced his heart by the birth of a son, but the poor child did not live long; it died in the spring, and in the summer, by the advice of the doctors, Lavretsky took his wife abroad to a watering-place.Distraction was essential for her after such a trouble, and her health, too, required a warm climate.The summer and autumn they spent in Germany and Switzerland, and for the winter, as one would naturally expect, they went to Paris.In Paris, Varvara Pavlovna bloomed like a rose, and was able to make herself a little nest as quickly and cleverly as in Petersburg.She found very pretty apartments in one of the quiet but fashionable streets in Paris; she embroidered her husband such a dressing-gown as he had never worn before; engaged a coquettish waiting maid, an excellent cook, and a smart footman, procured a fascinating carriage, and an exquisite piano.Before a week had passed, she crossed the street, wore her shawl, opened her parasol, and put on her gloves in a manner equal to the most true-born Parisian.And she soon drew round herself acquaintances.At first, only Russians visited her, afterwards Frenchmen too, very agreeable, polite, and unmarried, with excellent manners and well-sounding names; they all talked a great deal and very fast, bowed easily, grimaced agreeably; their white teeth flashed under their rosy lips—and how they could smile!All of them brought their friends, and la belle Madame de Lavretsky was soon known from Chausee d’Antin to Rue de Lille.In those days—it was in 1836—there had not yet arisen the tribe of journalists and reporters who now swarm on all sides like ants in an ant-hill; but even then there was seen in Varvara Pavlovna’s salon a certain M. Jules, a gentleman of unprepossessing exterior, with a scandalous reputation, insolent and mean, like all duelists and men who have been beaten.Varvara Pavlovna felt a great aversion to this M. Jules, but she received him because he wrote for various journals, and was incessantly mentioning her, calling her at one time Madame de L—tski, at another Madame de —, cette grande dame russe si distinguee, qui demeure rue de P—and telling all the world, that is, some hundreds of readers who had nothing to do with Madame de L—tski, how charming and delightful this lady was; a true Frenchwoman in intelligence (une vraie francaise par l’esprit)—Frenchmen have no higher praise than this—what an extraordinary musician she was, and how marvelously she waltzed (Varvara Pavlovna did in fact waltz so that she drew all her hearts to the hem of her light flying skirts)—in a word, he spread her fame through the world, and, whatever one may say, that is pleasant.Mademoiselle Mars had already left the stage, and Mademoiselle Rachel had not yet made her appearance; nevertheless, Varvara Pavlovna was assiduous in visiting the theatres.She went into raptures over Italian music, yawned decorously at the Comedie Francaise, and wept at the acting of Madame Dorval in some ultra romantic melodrama; and a great thing—Liszt played twice in her salon, and was so kind, so simple—it was charming!In such agreeable sensations was spent the winter, at the end of which Varvara Pavlovna was even presented at court.Fedor Ivanitch, for his part, was not bored, though his life, at times, weighed rather heavily on him—because it was empty.He read the papers, listened to the lectures at the Sorbonne and the College de France, followed the debates in the Chambers, and set to work on a translation of a well-known scientific treatise on irrigation.“I am not wasting my time,” he thought, “it is all of use; but next winter I must, without fail, return to Russia and set to work.”It is difficult to say whether he had any clear idea of precisely what this work would consist of; and there is no telling whether he would have succeeded in going to Russia in the winter; in the meantime, he was going with his wife to Baden.. An unexpected incident broke up all his plans.</td></tr>

And he did not finish the question, and yawned again, shivering and shaking all over.Memories—bright and gloomy—fretted him alike; suddenly it crossed his mind how some days before she had sat down to the piano and sung before him and Ernest the song, “Old husband, cruel husband!”He recalled the expression of her face, the strange light in her eyes, and the colour on her cheeks—and he got up from his seat, he would have liked to go to them, to tell them: “You were wrong to play your tricks on me; my great-grandfather used to hang the peasants up by their ribs, and my grandfather was himself a peasant,” and to kill them both.Then all at once it seemed to him as if all that was happening was a dream, scarcely even a dream, but some kind of foolish joke; that he need only shake himself and look round... He looked round, and like a hawk clutching its captured prey, anguish gnawed deeper and deeper into his heart.hawk clutching its captured prey, anguish gnawed deeper and deeper into his heart.To complete it all Lavretsky had been hoping in a few months to be a father.... The past, the future, his whole life was poisoned.He went back at last to Paris, stopped at an hotel and sent M. Ernest’s note to Varvara Pavlovna with the following letter:—</td></tr>

Jules.In this article there was a kind of sympathetic condolence apparent under the habitual playfulness; there was a deep sense of disgust in the soul of Fedor Ivanitch as he read this article.Afterwards he learned that a daughter had been born to him; two months later he received a notification from his steward that Varvara Pavlovna had asked for the first quarter’s allowance.Then worse and worse rumors began to reach him; at last, a tragic-comic story was reported with acclamations in all the papers.His wife played an unenviable part in it.It was the finishing stroke; Varvara Pavlovna had become a “notoriety.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Four days later, he set off for home.His coach rolled quickly along the soft cross-road.There had been no rain for a fortnight; a fine milk mist was diffused in the air and hung over the distant woods; a smell of burning came from it.A multitude of darkish clouds with blurred edges were creeping across the pale blue sky; a fairly strong breeze blew a dry and steady gale, without dispelling the heat.Leaning back with his head on the cushion and his arms crossed on his breast, Lavretsky watched the furrowed fields unfolding like a fan before him, the willow bushes as they slowly came into sight, and the dull ravens and rooks, who looked sidelong with stupid suspicion at the approaching carriage, the long ditches, overgrown with mugwort, wormwood, and mountain ash; and as he watched the fresh fertile wilderness and solitude of this steppe country, the greenness, the long slopes, and valleys with stunted oak bushes, the grey villages, and scant birch trees,—the whole Russian landscape, so long unseen by him, stirred emotion at once pleasant, sweet and almost painful in his heart, and he felt weighed down by a kind of pleasant oppression.Slowly his thoughts wandered; their outlines were as vague and indistinct as the outlines of the clouds which seemed to be wandering at random overhead.He remembered his childhood, his mother; he remembered her death, how they had carried him in to her, and how, clasping his head to her bosom, she had begun to wail over him, then had glanced at Glafira Petrovna—and checked herself.He remembered his father, at first vigorous, discontented with everything, with strident voice; and later, blind, tearful, with unkempt grey beard; he remembered how one day after drinking a glass too much at dinner, and spilling the gravy over his napkin, he began to relate his conquests, growing red in the face, and winking with his sightless eyes; he remember Varvara Pavlovna,—and involuntarily shuddered, as a man shudders from a sudden internal pain, and shook his head.Then his thoughts came to a stop at Lisa.</td></tr>

His head slipped on one side, he opened his eyes.The same fields, the same steppe scenery; the polished shoes of the trace-horses flashed alternately through the driving dust; the coachman’s shirt, yellow with red gussets, was puffed out by the wind.... “A nice home-coming!” glanced through Lavretsky’s brain; and he cried, “Get on!” wrapped himself in his cloak and pressed close into the cushion.The carriage jolted; Lavretsky sat up and opened his eyes wide.On the slope before him stretched a small hamlet; a little to the right could be seen an ancient manor house of small size, with closed shutters and a winding flight of steps; nettles, green and thick as hemp, grew over the wide courtyard from the very gates; in it stood a storehouse built of oak, still strong.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拉夫列茨基来到的这座不大的庄园住宅是两年前格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜去世的地方。它是上个世纪建造的，木材用的是很结实的松木，看起来古老，实际上还能住上五十年或者更久。拉夫列茨基到所有的房间都看了看，命令把所有的窗户都打开。这让那些一直居住在门梁和窗梁下的衰老迟缓的苍蝇十分不适，它们身上还盖着白色的尘土。自从格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜死后，这些窗户就没有打开过。屋里的一切都依然如故。客厅里摆着几张白色的细腿小沙发，上面蒙着光滑的灰色布料。沙发破旧不堪，快要散架了，让人不禁想起叶卡捷琳娜女皇时代。客厅里还有一把女主人最喜欢的安乐椅，椅背又高又直。即使在她暮年之时，她也没倚过那个椅背。客厅的正墙上挂着一幅费奥多尔的曾祖父安德雷·拉夫列茨基的旧画像。他那张暗黄色的脸，几乎无法从变形褪色的底版上辨认出来了。耷拉着的看似浮肿的眼睑下，一双凶恶的小眼睛发出冷酷的眼神。他眉头紧皱、神情凝重，没有施粉的黑发立了起来。画像的一角挂着一个蜡菊花圈，上面落满了灰尘。“这个花圈是格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜亲自编的。”安东讲道。卧室里放着一张窄窄的床架，上面挂着老式的质量很好的条纹布制成的帐幔。床上放有一堆褪了色的枕头和一床薄棉床罩，床头挂着一幅《圣母进入神殿》的画像。这个被人遗忘的老处女孤独死去时，最后一次把她那已冰冷的嘴唇贴在了这张画像的上面。窗前摆着一张嵌有铜饰的镶嵌木梳妆台。镜子看起来有点歪斜，镜框也失去了光泽。紧挨着卧室的是一个供奉神像的小房间。四面墙上空空的，什么都没有。角落里放着一个很沉的神龛。地上铺着破旧的小地毯，上面蜡渍点点。格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜过去就跪在上面跪拜祈祷。安东和拉夫列茨基的车夫一道去开马厩和车房的门了。一个差不多和他同样年纪的老太婆出现在了他站过的那个地方，她用头巾把头包得严严的，一直包到眉毛处。她摇晃着脑袋，眼睛暗淡无光，不过却表露出热情的神情，那是多年来恭顺服从的习惯，同时也流露出尊敬和同情之态。她吻了吻拉夫列茨基的手，然后就退到门道等候着主人吩咐。他根本想不起来她的名字，甚至都不记得以前是否见过她。原来她叫阿普拉克谢娅。四十年前，她被格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜从主人家里赶了出来，受命到这里饲养家禽。不过她少言寡语，好像已经老得失去感知了，只能逢迎地看着他。除了这两个上了年纪的人和三个穿着长罩衫的肚子鼓鼓的孩子（安东的曾孙）之外，这个庄园住宅里还住着一个被免除奴役的独臂农民。他像个山鹬一样咕咕哝哝的，什么都做不了。比他稍微有用的是那条刚刚用叫声欢迎拉夫列茨基归来的老狗。格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜命人买了一条沉甸甸的链子把他拴了起来，至今都有十年了，结果弄得它几乎无法移动或拖动链子。拉夫列茨基看完每个房间后，便来到了花园。对这个花园，他觉得非常满意。花园里处处长着高高的野草、牛蒡、醋栗和覆盆子丛，不过还有很多老椴树，枝桠奇形怪状，树干大得惊人，留下很多树阴。它们长得特别密，只是在某个时候经人修剪过，可能是一百年前了。花园的尽头是一个清澈的小池塘，四周是高高的红色灯心草。人类生活的迹象消失得真快。格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的庄园虽然尚未完全荒芜，不过好像也已经陷入寂静的睡眠状态中。万物俱籁，没有人类焦躁的搅扰。费奥多尔·伊凡内奇也在村子里转了转。农妇们手托着脸，从自己棚屋的门口瞅着他。农夫们老远就向他施礼致意，孩子们都跑走了，狗儿们懒懒地叫着。最后，他开始觉着饿了。可是，他的仆人和厨子要到晚上才能到，从拉夫里基来的运送食品的马车还没到。他只有去找安东了。安东立即张罗起来。他捉了只老母鸡，把它杀了，又拔了毛。阿普拉克谢娅像洗衣服一样又是搓又是洗，弄了好长时间，才把它放到锅里炖。最后，鸡终于做好了。安东摆好桌子，放好桌布和刀叉，又在旁边摆了一个失去了光泽的三脚盐瓶、一个塞着圆玻璃塞的雕花细颈玻璃酒瓶。然后，他唱歌似的向拉夫列茨基宣布饭菜已经准备好了，自己用餐布裹着右臂，站到了主人的椅子后面。他身上发出一种特殊的像柏树气味一样的强烈又古老的气味。拉夫列茨基尝了一下鸡汤，把鸡捞了出来。鸡皮上到处都是大水泡，每条鸡腿上都能看到粗糙的肌腱。鸡肉有一股木头味和苏打味。用餐过后，拉夫列茨基说他想喝杯茶，如果……“我这就送来。”老人插话说。他果然没有食言。他在一个用红纸拧成螺丝状的纸包里找到了一小撮茶叶和一个茶壶。茶壶虽然小，但在火上烧得很旺，嘶嘶直响。他还找到几小块看起来似乎要溶化了的方糖。拉夫列茨基用一只大茶杯喝了茶。他从小就记得这只杯子，上面画着些纸牌，是专供来客喝茶用的——现在呢，他正像一个客人一样用它喝茶呢。到了晚上，他的仆人到了。拉夫列茨基不想在姑姑的床上睡，就让仆人在客厅里给他铺了一张床。他熄灭蜡烛，久久地注视着四周，沉浸在不悦的思绪之中。他经历的感觉就像每个在很久没有人居住过的地方过夜的人所感觉的那样。他似乎觉得，四周包围着他的黑暗并不能习惯这个新来的居住者，这间房子的四壁好像感到很吃惊。最后，他叹了口气，把被子拉过来盖在身上，睡着了。大家都休息了，安东还没睡。他和阿普拉克谢娅低声耳语了很长时间，他低声叹着气，还划了两次十字。他们俩都没想到主人会跟他们一起住在瓦西里耶夫斯科耶，而不是住在离这不远的华美邸宅，那座住宅是花重金建成的。他们也不会想到，那座住宅正是拉夫列茨基深恶痛绝的，它会激起他内心痛苦的回忆。聊够了之后，安东拿了根棍子，在静静地挂了好多年的打更板上敲了几下，就躺在院子里睡了，头发花白的脑袋上什么也没有盖。五月的夜暖暖的，很舒服，老人也睡得很香甜。</td>
		<td class="en">The small manor-house to which Lavretsky had come and in which two years before Glafira Petrovna had breathed her last, had been built in the preceding century of solid pine-wood; it looked ancient, but it was still strong enough to stand another fifty years or more.Lavretsky made the tour of all the rooms, and to the great discomfiture of the aged languid flies, settled under the lintels and covered with white dust, he ordered the windows to be opened everywhere; they had not been opened ever since the death of Glafira Petrovna.Everything in the house had remained as it was; the thin-legged white miniature couches in the drawing-room, covered with glossy grey stuff, threadbare and rickety, vividly suggested the days of Catherine; in the drawing-room, too, stood the mistress’s favourite arm-chair, with high straight back, against which she never leaned even in her old age.On the principal wall hung a very old portrait of Fedor’s great-grandfather, Andrey Lavretsky; the dark yellow face was scarcely distinguishable from the warped and blackened background; the small cruel eyes looked grimly out from beneath the eyelids, which dropped as if they were swollen; his black unpowdered hair rose bristling above his heavy indented brow.In the corner of the portrait hung a wreath of dusty immortelles.“Glafira Petrovna herself was pleased to make it,” Anton announced.In the bedroom stood a narrow bedstead, under a canopy of old-fashioned and very good striped material; a heap of faded cushions and a thin quilted counterpane lay on the bed, and at the head hung a picture of the Presentation in the Temple of the Holy Mother of God; it was the very picture which the old maid, dying alone and forgotten by every one, had for the last time pressed to her chilling lips.A little toilet table of inlaid wood, with brass fittings and a warped looking-glass in a tarnished frame stood in the window.Next to the bedroom was the little ikon room with bare walls and a heavy case of holy images in the corner; on the floor lay a threadbare rug spotted with wax; Glafira Petrovna used to pray bowing to the ground upon it.Anton went away with Lavretsky’s groom to unlock the stable and coach-house; to replace him appeared an old woman of about the same age, with a handkerchief tied round to her very eyebrows; her head shook, and her eyes were dim, but they expressed zeal, the habit of years of submissive service, and at the same time a kind of respectful commiseration.She kissed Lavretsky’s hand and stood still in the doorway awaiting his orders.He positively could not recollect her name and did not even remember whether he had ever seen her.Her name, it appeared, was Apraxya; forty years before, Glafira Petrovna had put her out of the master’s house and ordered that she should be a poultry woman.She said little, however; she seemed to have lost her senses from old age, and could only gaze at him obsequiously.Besides these two old creatures and three pot-bellied children in long smocks, Anton’s great-grandchildren, there was also living in the manor-house a one-armed peasant, who was exempted from servitude; he muttered like a woodcock and was of no use for anything.Not much more useful was the decrepit dog who had saluted Lavretsky’s return by its barking; he had been for ten years fastened up by a heavy chain, purchased at Glafira Petrovna’s command, and was scarcely able to move and drag the weight of it.Having looked over the house, Lavretsky went into the garden and was very much pleased with it.It was all overgrown with high grass, and burdock, and gooseberry and raspberry bushes, but there was plenty of shade, and many old lime-trees, which were remarkable for their immense size and the peculiar growth of their branches; they had been planted too close and at some time or other—a hundred years before—they had been lopped.At the end of the garden was a small clear pool bordered with high reddish rushes.The traces of human life very quickly pass away; Glafira Petrovna’s estate had not had time to become quite wild, but already it seemed plunged in that quiet slumber in which everything reposes on earth where there is not the infection of man’s restlessness.Fedor Ivanitch walked also through the village; the peasant-women stared at him from the doorways of their huts, their cheeks resting on their hands; the peasants saluted him from a distance, the children ran out, and the dogs barked indifferently.At last he began to feel hungry; but he did not expect his servants and his cook till the evening; the waggons of provisions from Lavriky had not come yet, and he had to have recourse to Anton.Anton arranged matters at once; he caught, killed, and plucked an old hen; Apraxya gave it a long rubbing and cleaning, and washed it like linen before putting it into the stew-pan; when, at last, it was cooked Anton laid the cloth and set the table, placing beside the knife and fork a three-legged salt-cellar of tarnished plate and a cut decanter with a round glass stopper and a narrow neck; then he announced to Lavretsky in a sing-song voice that the meal was ready, and took his stand behind his chair, with a napkin twisted round his right fights, and diffusing about him a peculiar strong ancient odour, like the scent of a cypress-tree.Lavretsky tried the soup, and took out the hen; its skin was all covered with large blisters; a tough tendon ran up each leg; the meat had a flavour of wood and soda.When he had finished dinner, Lavretsky said that he would drink a cup of tea, if—“I will bring it this minute,” the old man interrupted.And he kept his word.A pinch of tea was hunted up, twisted in a screw of red paper; a small but very fiery and loudly-hissing samovar was found, and sugar too in small lumps, which looked as if they were thawing.Lavretsky drank tea out of a large cup; he remembered this cup from childhood; there were playing-cards depicted upon it, only visitors used to drink out of it—and here was he drinking out if like a visitor.In the evening his servants came; Lavretsky did not care to sleep in his aunt’s bed; he directed them put him up a bed in the dining-room.After extinguishing his candle he stared for a long time about him and feel into cheerless reflection; he experienced that feeling which every man knows whose lot it is to pass the night in a place long uninhabited; it seemed to him that the darkness surrounding him on all sides could not be accustomed to the new inhabitant, the very walls of the house seemed amazed.At last he sighed, drew up the counterpane round him and fell asleep.Anton remained up after all the rest of the household; he was whispering a long while with Apraxya, he sighed in an undertone, and twice he crossed himself; they had neither of them expected that their master would settle among them at Vassilyevskoe when he had not far off such a splendid estate with such a capitally built house; they did not suspect that the very house was hateful to Lavretsky; it stirred painful memories within him.Having gossiped to his heart’s content, Anton took a stick and struck the night watchman’s board, which had hung silent for so many years, and laid down to sleep in the courtyard with no covering on his white head.The May night was mild and soft, and the old man slept sweetly.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，我真是沉入到河底了。”他不止一次地自言自语。他一动不动地坐在窗前，仿佛在倾听他周围的宁静生活流过，倾听这与世隔绝的乡野中的各种声响。荨麻后面好像有谁在发出尖锐的啁啾声，一只蚊子似乎在应和着。现在，啁啾声停止了，那只蚊子仍然嗡嗡地尖叫着。伴随着苍蝇不厌其烦、急促、愉悦的嗡嗡声，一只肥大的蜜蜂也哼着曲子，不断用脑袋撞着天花板。一只公鸡在街上鸣叫，嘶哑的叫声拖得老长。一辆马车嘎吱嘎吱地驶过，村子里的一个大门正吱吱响着。“怎么啦？”一位农妇刺耳的声音响起。“啊，我的小宝贝。”安东对他怀里抱着的一个两岁大的小女孩大声说，他正颤动着胳臂哄她。“去把克瓦斯淡啤酒拿来。”刚才那个妇人的声音又响起。接着是突然而至的死一般的寂静。什么都不响了，什么都不动了。风不再拨动树叶，燕子一只接一只地从大地上空飞过，没发出一点声音。它们悄无声息的飞翔使人感到忧伤。“现在，我真是沉入到河底了。”拉夫列茨基心想。“这里的生活一直都是这样宁静、节奏缓慢。”他想，“无论谁进入了这个圈子，都得向它屈服。这儿没什么让你焦虑不安，没什么让你感到困扰。只有像农夫犁出条条垄沟那样放慢做事的步调，才能融入这里的生活。这个慢吞吞的地方蕴藏着多少活力，多少健康啊！在窗子底下，一根强壮的牛蒡从茂盛的草丛中偷偷探出头来，圆叶当归在它上面拖着水灵灵的茎。更高的地方，圣母泪草高高地扬起它那粉红色的卷须。远处，田野里的麦子闪着光，燕麦已经抽穗扬花。每棵树上的每片叶子，每株小草的每根草茎都使足了劲，铺展开来。我最美好的时光都流逝于对一个女人的爱。”拉夫列茨基接着想道，“希望这一成不变的生活让我清醒，给我安慰，让我准备好，以学会从从容容地做事情。”他又开始沉醉在对这片宁静的聆听之中，什么也不期盼——同时，又像一直在期盼着什么。静谧从四面八方把他包围起来，太阳在恬静的蓝天中平稳地移动，云朵也平稳地在空中穿梭。它们似乎知道为什么而移动，也知道要移动到哪里去。就在这个时候，地球上的其它地方，生活正在熙熙攘攘、激荡碰撞。而在这里，生活如水流过沼泽般悄无声息地滑过。一直到了夜晚，拉夫列茨基也无法让自己从对已然走过的生活的沉思中摆脱出来。往事的悲痛恰似春天的积雪，在他的心中融化——真是奇怪了——他对故乡的感情从未如此深沉，如此强烈。</td>
		<td class="en">“Here I am at the very bottom of the river,” he said to himself more than once.He sat at the window without stirring, and, as it were, listened to the current of the quiet life surrounding him, to the few sounds of the country solitude.Something from behind the nettles chirps with a shrill, shrill little note; a gnat seems to answer it.Now it has ceased, but still the gnat keeps up its sharp whirr; across the pleasant, persistent, fretful buzz of the flies sounds the hum of a big bee, constantly knocking its head against the ceiling; a cock crows in the street, hoarsely prolonging the last note; there is the rattle of a cart; in the village a gate is creaking.Then the jarring voice of a peasant woman, “What?”“Hey, you are my little sweetheart,” cries Anton to the little two-year-old girl he is dandling in his arms.“Fetch the kvas,” repeats the same woman’s voice, and all at once there follows a deathly silence; nothing rattles, nothing is moving; the wind is not stirring a leaf; without a sound the swallows fly one after another over the earth, and sadness weights on the heart from their noiseless flight.“Here I am at the very bottom of the river,” thought Lavretsky again.“And always, at all times life here is quiet, unhasting,” he thought; “whoever comes within its circle must submit; here there is nothing to agitate, nothing to harass; one can only get on here by making one’s way slowly, as the ploughman cuts the furrow with his plough.And what vigour, what health abound in this inactive place!Here under the window the sturdy burdock creeps out of the thick grass; above it the lovage trails its juicy stalks and the Virgin’s tears fling still higher their pink tendrils; and yonder further in the fields is the silky rye, and the oats are already in ear, and every leaf on every tree, every grass on its stalk is spread to its fullest width.In the love of a woman my best years have gone by,” Lavretsky went on thinking, “let me be sobered by the sameness of life here, let me be soothed and made ready, so that I may learn to do my duty without haste.”And again he fell to listening to the silence, expecting nothing—and at the same time constantly expecting something; the silence enfolded him on all sides, the sun moved calmly in the peaceful blue sky, and the clouds sailed calmly across it; they seemed to know why and whither they were sailing.At this same time in other places on the earth there is the seething, the bustle, the clash of life; life here slipped by noiseless, as water over marshy grass; and even till evening Lavretsky could not tear himself from the contemplation of this life as it passed and glided by; sorrow for the past was melting in his soul like snow in spring, and strange to say, never had the feeling of home been so deep and strong within him.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >费奥多尔·伊凡内奇用了两个星期的时间把格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的小房子收拾得井然有序，把庭院和花园也清扫干净。舒适的家具被从拉夫里基给他运来，葡萄酒、书籍和报纸也从城里运来，马厩里出现了马匹。简言之，费奥多尔·伊凡内奇给自己置办了一切生活必需品，开始过起了一种生活——既不是准确意义上的乡村地主生活，也不完全是乡野隐士的生活。他的日子过得很单调。虽然他看不见什么人，不过他也不觉得无聊。他勤勤恳恳、专心致志地经营自己的庄园，骑着马在附近四处转转，还会读读书。不过，他读书并不多。他发现听老安东讲故事更有趣。拉夫列茨基常常坐在窗户边，嘴里叼个烟斗，面前放碗凉茶。安东双手交叉放在背后，站在门口，开始慢慢地细讲起古代和神话里的故事。在故事里的那些时代，黑麦和燕麦还不是用称计量着卖，而是用大麻袋计量，两三个法寻就能买到一麻袋。那时，有些森林无法穿越，未开垦的原野四处伸展，甚至延伸到城边。“现在呢，”年过八十的老人抱怨说，“大量的砍伐和开垦导致马车都没地方可走了。”安东还讲了很多他的女主人格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的故事，讲她有多么谨慎，多么节俭。曾有一位年轻的先生住在附近，对她心生爱慕，常常骑马过来看她。而她为了他，高兴地戴上她最好的包发帽（上面带有橙色缎带），穿上用利凡廷绸缝制的黄色连衣裙。可后来，那位先生出言不逊地询问道：“小姐，请问您该有很多财产吧？”她对此怒不可遏，吩咐仆人不准他再来家里。当时，她还发出命令说，她辞世之后，所有的东西，就算是一块破布，也要留给费奥多尔·伊凡内奇。的确如此，拉夫列茨基发现姑姑的所有东西都好端端地保存着，连那顶带有橙色缎带的包发帽，即她最好的包发帽和那件利凡廷绸缝制的黄色连衣裙都不例外。拉夫列茨基想找一些旧文件和有趣的文献，可是却无迹可寻，只找到一本破旧的书。他的祖父彼得·安德烈耶维奇在书上的一处写道：“亚历山大·亚历山大罗维奇·普罗卓罗夫斯基王子阁下与土耳其帝国缔结和约，圣彼得堡举城欢庆。” 还有一个地方记录了医治胸部疼痛的汤剂药方，附注是：这是“给予生命的三位一体教堂”大牧师费奥多尔·阿夫克欣季耶维奇赠给普拉斯科菲雅·费奥多罗芙娜将军夫人的药方。还有一处写着这样一则政治新闻：不知为何，大家不怎么谈论法国虎了。紧挨着这则新闻，写的是：《莫斯科新闻》宣布米哈伊尔·彼得罗维奇·科雷切夫中校先生逝世。他不是彼得·瓦西里耶维奇·科雷切夫的儿子吗？拉夫列茨基还找到了一些旧历书和解梦书，以及安波季克先生的那本神秘著作。已被忘却许久却广为人知的《象征与图谱》勾起了他许多回忆。在格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的梳妆台的抽屉里，拉夫列茨基发现了一个用黑丝带系着，还用黑色的火漆封着的小包，这个小包在抽屉最里面的角落里。小包里有两张画像面对面放着。一幅是他父亲年轻时的粉蜡笔画，他柔软的卷发散落在前额上，一双杏眼懒洋洋地睁着，嘴巴张开。另一幅画像几乎看不清了，画上是一位身穿白色连衣裙、面色苍白的女人，手里拿着一支白色的玫瑰——这是他的母亲。格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜从不允许别人给她画像。“我，自己，费奥多尔·伊凡内奇老爷，”安东曾对拉夫列茨基说，“尽管我当时没住在老爷府上，我还是记得您的曾祖父安德雷·阿法纳西耶维奇，因为他过世的时候，我已经十八岁了。有一次，我在花园里碰见他，吓得我直打哆嗦。不过，他老人家并没怎么样我，只是问了下我的名字，吩咐我到他的房间去拿他的手帕。他是位绅士——怎么给您说呢——他从来不觉得别的任何人比他厉害。因为您的曾祖父，我敢确定，他有一个神奇的护身符，是一位来自希腊阿陀斯山的和尚赠送给他的礼物。他还告诉他，就是这个和尚说：‘老爷，为了感谢您的善心，我把这个送给您。戴着它，您不需要害怕别人怎么说。’哦，不过，老爷，谁都知道那是什么年代。那时候，主人想干什么就能干什么。有时，就算某个贵族老爷想要与他作对，他只是瞅上那人一眼，说：‘你还嫩着呢。’这是他最爱说的一句话了。您已故的曾祖父曾住在一个小木屋里，留下的财产却不计其数，银子啦，各种各样的东西！所有的储藏室都满得要装不下了。他把家经营得特别好。那个你啧啧赞叹的玻璃酒瓶，就是他的。他以前用它来喝白兰地。不过，您的祖父彼得·安德烈耶维奇用石块为自己盖了一座宫殿，却没有积攒下财富。他什么事都没干好，日子过得远不如他的父亲好，自己过得也一点都不快乐。不过，他倒是把钱都挥霍光了，现在没什么用来追忆他的——他连把银勺子都没留下。所有保存下的东西都多亏了格拉菲拉·彼得罗芙娜的经营。”</td>
		<td class="en">In the course of a fortnight, Fedor Ivanitch had brought Glafira Petrovna’s little house into order and had cleared the court-yard and the garden.From Lavriky comfortable furniture was sent him; from the town, wine, books, and papers; horses made their appearance in the stable; in brief Fedor Ivanitch provided himself with everything necessary and began to live—not precisely after the manner of a country landowner, nor precisely after the manner of a hermit.His days passed monotonously; but he was not bored though he saw no one; he set diligently and attentively to work at farming his estate, rode about the neighbourhood and did some reading.He read little, however; he found it pleasanter to listen to the tales of old Anton.Lavretsky usually sat at the window with a pipe and a cup of cold tea.Anton stood at the door, his hands crossed behind him, and began upon his slow, deliberate stories of old times, of those fabulous times when oats and rye were not sold by measure, but in great sacks, at two or three farthings a sack; when there were impassable forests, virgin steppes stretching on every side, even close to the town.“And now,” complained the old man, whose eightieth year had passed, “there has been so much clearing, so much ploughing everywhere, there’s nowhere you may drive now.”Anton used to tell many stories, too, of his mistress, Glafira Petrovna; how prudent and saving she was; how a certain gentleman, a young neighbour, had paid her court, and used to ride over to see her, and how she was even pleased to put on her best cap, with ribbons of salmon colour, and her yellow gown of tru-tru levantine for him; but how, later on, she had been angry with the gentleman neighbour for his unseemly inquiry, “What, madam, pray, might be your fortune?” and had bade them refuse him the house; and how it was then that she had given directions that, after her decease, everything to the last rag should pass to Fedor Ivanitch.And, indeed, Lavretsky found all his aunt’s household goods intact, not excepting the best cap with ribbons of salmon colour, and the yellow gown of tru-tru levantine.Of old papers and interesting documents, upon which Lavretsky had reckoned, there seemed no trace, except one old book, in which his grandfather, Piotr Andreitch, had inscribed in one place, “Celebration in the city of Saint Petersburg of the peace, concluded with the Turkish empire by his Excellency Prince Alexander Alexandrovitch Prozorovsky;” in another place a recipe for a pectoral decoction with the comment, “This recipe was given to the general’s lady, Prascovya Federovna Soltikov, by the chief priest of the Church of the Life-giving Trinity, Fedor Avksentyevitch:” in another, a piece of political news of this kind: “Somewhat less talk of the French tigers;” and next this entry: “In the Moscow Gazette an announcement of the death of Mr. Senior-Major Mihal Petrovitch Kolitchev.Is not this the son of Piotr Vassilyevitch Kolitchev?Lavretsky found also some old calendars and dream-books, and the mysterious work of Ambodik; many were the memories stirred by the well-known; but long-forgotten Symbols and Emblems.In Glafira Petrovna’s little dressing-table, Lavretsky found a small packet, tied up with black ribbon, sealed with black sealing wax, and thrust away in the very farthest corner of the drawer.In the parcel there lay face to face a portrait, in pastel, of his father in his youth, with effeminate curls straying over his brow, with almond-shaped languid eyes and parted lips, and a portrait, almost effaced, of a pale woman in a white dress with a white rose in her hand—his mother.Of herself, Glafira Petrovna had never allowed a portrait to be taken.“I, myself, little father, Fedor Ivanitch,” Anton used to tell Lavretsky, “though I did not then live in the master’s house, still I can remember your great-grandfather, Andrey Afanasyevitch, seeing that I had come to my eighteenth year when he died.Once I met him in the garden and my knees were knocking with fright indeed; however, he did nothing, only asked me my name, and sent me to his room for his pocket-handkerchief.He was a gentleman—how shall I tell you—he didn’t look on any one as better than himself.For your great-grandfather had, I do assure you, a magic amulet; a monk from Mount Athos made him a present of this amulet.And he told him, this monk did, “It’s for your kindness, Boyar, I give you this; wear it, and you need not fear judgment.”Well, but there, little father, we know what those times were like; what the master fancied doing, that he did.Sometimes, if even some gentleman saw fit to cross him in anything, he would just stare at him and say, “You swim in shallow water;” that was his favourite saying.And he lived, your great-grandfather of blessed memory, in a small log-house; and what goods he left behind him, what silver, and stores of all kinds!All the storehouses were full and overflowing.He was a manager.That very decanter, that you were pleased to admire, was his; he used to drink brandy out of it.But there was your grandfather, Piotr Andreitch, built himself a palace of stone, but he never grew rich; everything with him went badly, and he lived worse than his father by far, and he got no pleasure from it for himself, but spent all his money, and now there is nothing to remember him by—not a silver spoon has come down from him, and we have Glafira Petrovna’s management to thank for all that is saved.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As he uttered the two last lines, Mihalevitch all but shed tears; a slight spasm—the sign of deep emotion—passed over his wide mouth, his ugly face lighted up.Lavretsky listened, and listened to him—and the spirit of antagonism was aroused in him; he was irritated by the ever-ready enthusiasm of the Moscow student, perpetually at boiling-point.Before a quarter of an hour had elapsed a heated argument had broken out between them, one of these endless arguments, of which only Russians are capable.After a separation of many years spent in two different worlds, with no clear understanding of the other’s ideas or even of their own, catching at words and replying only in words, they disputed about the most abstract subjects, and they disputed as though it were a matter of life and death for both: they shouted and vociferated so that every one in the house was startled, and poor Lemm, who had locked himself up in his room directly after Mihalevitch arrived, was bewildered, and began even to feel vaguely alarmed.</td></tr>

Alas! the music turned out to be complicated and painfully strained; it was clear that the composer had striven to express something passionate and deep, but nothing had come of it; the effort had remained an effort.Lavretsky and Lisa both felt this, and Lemm understood it.Without uttering a single word, he put his song back into his pocket, and in reply to Lisa’s proposal to play it again, he only shook his head and said significantly: “Now—enough!” and shrinking into himself he turned away.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Towards evening the whole party went out to fish.In the pond behind the garden there were plenty of carp and groundlings.Marya Dmitrievna was put in an arm-chair near the banks, in the shade, with a rug under her feet and the best line was given to her.Anton as an old experienced angler offered her his services.He zealously put on the worms, and clapped his hand on them, spat on them and even threw in the line with a graceful forward swing of his whole body.Marya Dmitrievna spoke of him the same day to Fedor Ivanitch in the following phrase, in boarding-school French: “Il n’y a plus maintenant de ces gens comme ca, comme autrefois.”Lemm with the two little girls went off further to the dam of the pond; Lavretsky took up his position near Lisa.The fish were continually biting, the carp were constantly flashing in the air with golden and silvery sides as they were drawn in; the cries of pleasure of the little girls were incessant, even Marya Dmitrievna uttered a little feminine shriek on two occasions.The fewest fish were caught by Lavretsky and Lisa; probably this was because they paid less attention than the others to the angling, and allowed their floats to swim back right up to the bank.The high reddish reeds rustled quietly around, the still water shone quietly before them, and quietly too they talked together.Lisa was standing on a small raft; Lavretsky sat on the inclined trunk of a willow; Lisa wore a white gown, tied round the waist with a broad ribbon, also white; her straw hat was hanging on one hand, and in the other with some effort she held up the crooked rod.Lavretsky gazed at her pure, somewhat severe profile, at her hair drawn back behind her ears, at her soft cheeks, which glowed like a little child’s, and thought, “Oh, how sweet you are, bending over my pond!”Lisa did not turn to him, but looked at the water, half frowning, to keep the sun out of her eyes, half smiling.The shade of the lime-tree near fell upon both.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时夜幕已降临，玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜表现出想回家的意思，小姑娘们依依不舍地离开了池塘，然后被安顿好准备出发了。拉夫列茨基宣布他要亲自将客人们送至半路，于是吩咐下人把马备好。他把玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜扶上马车时，想起了莱姆，但哪儿也不见这个老家伙的踪影。一钓完鱼，他立马就消失不见了。安东“砰”的一声把车门关上了，对于他这个年纪来说，他的力气可不是一般的大。他严厉地喊道：“车夫，出发！”马车便开动了。玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜和莉萨同坐在马车的后座上。两个女孩和侍女坐在前排。夜晚温暖而静谧，两边的车窗都敞开着。在莉萨那一边，拉夫列茨基策马靠近马车，一只手搭在车门上——马儿以平稳的节奏前行，他把缰绳甩在了马颈上——不时和那位年轻的女郎闲聊几句。夕阳西下，余辉熠熠。夕阳西下，余辉熠熠。夜幕降临，空气却似乎变得暖和起来了。玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜很快开始打瞌睡了，小女孩们和侍女也进入了梦乡。马车稳稳当当地向前飞驶着。莉萨俯身向前，心情愉悦。徐徐升起的皓月照着她的脸庞，幽幽含香的夜风拂过她的双眸和面颊。她的一只手紧挨着拉夫列茨基的那只手搁在车门上。他满心欢喜。在这宁静柔美的夜色中，他策马飞奔，目光一刻也没有从那张娇美年轻的脸庞上移开。她那充满青春活力的声音传到他的耳朵里，连低声细语也是那么悦耳，她讲的都是些纯洁美好的事物，他甚至没有意识到已经走过了一半路程。他不想把玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜吵醒，便轻轻地按了按莉萨的手，说：“我们现在可以算是朋友了，不是吗？”她点点头。他勒住马，马车继续向前行驶着，晃晃颠颠、时隐时现。拉夫列茨基朝着回家的方向，策马缓步前行。他沉醉于这迷人的夏夜中，周遭的一切仿佛突然变得如此陌生，却又是熟知已久、亲切美好。无论在近处还是远处——人能看到很远的地方，虽然许多东西看不清楚——一切都是那么祥和。这深深的祥和里似乎焕发出了年轻而旺盛的生命力。拉夫列茨基的马毫无畏惧地向前奔跑着，有规律地左右摇摆着。庞大的黑色影子在旁边随它同时前进。马蹄的嘚嘚声给人以不同寻常的美好感受，鹌鹑响亮的啼叫中有着奇妙的吸引力。繁星隐没在透着光亮的淡雾中。明月尚未满盈，寒光流闪，月光如淡蓝色的流水溢满天空，洒落在从附近飘来的薄薄的云层上，留下一片片薄如轻烟的金色。清新的空气让他的眼睛微微湿润起来，轻柔地拥抱着他的四肢和躯干，沁入心脾。拉夫列茨基完全沉浸在此刻的喜悦之中，并为这种独自的享受感到欣喜不已。“来吧，我们还活着呢，”他想，“我们还没有被彻底压垮……”他并没有说明被什么人或什么事压垮。之后，他想起了莉萨，他认为她几乎不可能爱上潘申。他想，倘若他不是在这种情况下遇到了她——只有上帝知道结局如何。他很明白莱姆的心意，虽然她“说不出自己的话来”。他又想，不是这样的，她有自己的话。“请别轻率地谈论这件事。”他又想起了莉萨的话。他骑在马背上，低头沉思，就这样走过了很长的一段路。随后，他直起身来，慢悠悠地高声重复起那首诗：</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile the evening had come on, Marya Dmitrievna expressed a desire to return home, and the little girls were with difficulty torn away from the pond, and made ready.Lavretsky declared that he would escort his guests half-way, and ordered his horse to be saddled.As he was handing Marya Dmitrievna into the coach, he bethought himself of Lemm; but the old man could nowhere be found.He had disappeared directly after the angling was over.Anton, with an energy remarkable for his years, slammed the doors, and called sharply, “Go on, coachman!” the coach started.Marya Dmitrievna and Lisa were seated in the back seat; the children and their maid in the front.The evening was warm and still, and the windows were open on both sides.Lavretsky trotted near the coach on the side of Lisa, with his arm leaning on the door—he had thrown the reigns on the neck of his smoothly-pacing horse—and now and then he exchanged a few words with the young girl.The glow of sunset was!The glow of sunset was disappearing; night came on, but the air seemed to grow even warmer.Marya Dmitrievna was soon slumbering, the little girls and the maid fell asleep also.The coach rolled swiftly and smoothly along; Lisa was bending forward, she felt happy; the rising moon lighted up her face, the fragrant night on breeze breathed on her eyes and cheeks.Her hand rested on the coach door near Lavretsky’s hand.And he was happy; borne along in the still warmth of the night, never taking his eyes off the good young face, listening to the young voice that was melodious even in a whisper, as it spoke of simple, good things, he did not even notice that he had gone more than half-way.He did not want to wake Marya Dmitrievna, he lightly pressed Lisa’s hand and said, “I think we are friends now, aren’t we?”She nodded, he stopped his horse, and the coach rolled away, lightly swaying and oscillating up and down; Lavretsky turned homeward at a walking pace.The witchery of the summer night enfolded him; all around him seemed suddenly so strange—and at the same time so long known; so sweetly familiar.Everywhere near and afar—and one could see into the far distance, though the eye could not make out clearly much of what was seen—all was at peace; youthful, blossoming life seemed expressed in this deep peace.Lavretsky’s horse stepped out bravely, swaying evenly to right and left; its great black shadow moved along beside it.There was something strangely sweet in the tramp of its hoofs, a strange charm in the ringing cry of the quails.The stars were lost in a bright mist; the moon, not yet at the full, shone with steady brilliance; its light was shot in an azure stream over the sky, and fell in patches of smoky gold on the thin clouds as they drifted near.The freshness of the air drew a slight moisture into the eyes, sweetly folded all the limbs, and flowed freely into the lungs.Lavretsky rejoiced in it, and was glad at his own rejoicing.“Come, we are still alive,” he thought; “we have not been altogether destroyed by”—he did not say—by whom or by what.Then he fell to thinking of Lisa, that she could hardly love Panshin, that if he had met her under different circumstances—God knows what might have come of it; that he undertook Lemm though Lisa had no words of “her own:” but that, he thought, was not true; she had words of her own.“Don’t speak light of that,” came back to Lavretsky’s mind.He rode a long way with his head bent in thought, then drawing himself up, he slowly repeated aloud:</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天过得索然无味。雨从一大早就开始下了。莱姆眉头紧锁，嘴巴抿得更紧了，仿佛已经发过誓再也不开口一样。拉夫列茨基回房间入寝时，把一叠法国报纸带上了床。这些报纸还没有开封，已经放在他桌上至少两周了。他漫不经心地撕开包装，匆匆地浏览了报纸的各个栏目。不过，里面并没有什么新闻。他正要把它们扔到一边时，突然好像被什么叮到似的跳下了床。一张报纸的某篇文章里，大家都熟知的朱尔斯先生向读者报道了一条“令人悲痛”的消息。“冰雪聪明、貌美绝伦的莫斯科美人，“他写道，“时尚女王，巴黎沙龙的宠儿，拉夫列茨基夫人突然仙逝。”令人惋惜的是，此消息千真万确。朱尔斯先生刚刚得到消息。他继续写道，“他算得上是亡人的一个朋友。”</td>
		<td class="en">The next day passed rather dully.Rain was falling from early morning; Lemm wore a scowl, and kept more and more tightly compressing his lips, as though he had taken an oath never to open them again.When he went to his room, Lavretsky took up to bed with him a whole bundle of French newspapers, which had been lying for more than fortnight on his table unopened.He began indifferently to tear open the wrappings, and glanced hastily over the columns of the newspapers—in which, however, there was nothing new.He was just about to throw them down—and all at once he leaped out of bed as if he had been stung.In an article in one of the papers, M. Jules, with whom we are already familiar, communicated to his readers a “mournful intelligence, that charming, fascinating Moscow lady,” he wrote, “one of the queens of fashion, who adorned Parisian salons, Madame de Lavretsky, had died almost suddenly, ”and this intelligence, unhappily only too well-founded, had only just reached him, M.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >次日早上，茶点时分，莱姆请求拉夫列茨基给他备好马车，让他回城。“我该去着手工作了，去教我的课。”这个老人说，“况且，我在这儿呆着，纯属浪费时间。”拉夫列茨基没有马上回他的话，似乎有些心不在焉。“很好，”最后他说，“我跟您一同前去。”莱姆不让仆人帮忙，自己喘吁吁、气呼呼地把他那个不大的皮箱拾掇好，还把几张乐谱纸撕烂，然后烧掉了。马车准备好了。拉夫列茨基从房间里走出来时，把他前一天晚上看过的那张报纸塞进了口袋。整个途中，莱姆和拉夫列茨基很少交谈，各自忙于想着自己的心事，都为这份清净感到高兴。分手时，两人都相当冷淡，不过，在俄罗斯，这种情形在朋友之间是常见的。拉夫列茨基把莱姆送到他的小屋门口。老人下了马车，取出皮箱，没有和他的朋友握手（他用双手把皮箱抱在胸前），甚至没有看他的朋友一眼，只用俄语说了声“再见！”“再见！”拉夫列茨基说了同样的话，之后吩咐车夫把马车驶向自己的住处。他之前在Ｏ市租了几间房子……拉夫列茨基写了几封信，匆匆地吃过午饭之后，就往卡里金家去了。在他们家的客厅里，拉夫列茨基只看到潘申一个人。潘申告诉他玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜马上就来，还用亲切友好的口吻和他闲聊起来。那天之前，潘申对待拉夫列茨基的态度如果称不上傲慢，至少也有点屈尊的意思。然而，莉萨跟潘申讲述前一天的郊游时，说拉夫列茨基是个很棒的人，很有头脑。这已经足够了，他觉得必须要给这个“很棒的人”留个好印象。首先，潘申对拉夫列茨基讲了一堆恭维奉承的话，然后把玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜一家说到瓦西里耶夫斯科耶时表现出的欢喜之情描述了一番。接着，按照他一贯的作风，把话题神不知鬼不觉地转移到自己身上，谈他的工作、人生观、世界观以及对政府机关的看法。他用一两句话谈了谈对俄罗斯未来以及省长们如何执好政的见解。说到这里，他还冷笑着自嘲了两句，又补充说他在彼得堡奉命要推广“土地调查并注册”的理念。他滔滔不绝地说了很久，对一切困难都漫不经心、狂妄自大地发表一下自己的高见，认为解决那些极其重要的行政与政治问题对他来说犹如变戏法的人玩弹球，简直易如反掌。他嘴边时不时挂着“要是我在政府工作，我就会那么做”这样的话，以及“你这么一个聪明人，肯定会立马和我站在一边的。”拉夫列茨基听着潘申的夸夸其谈，很是不屑。他不喜欢这个英俊、聪明、附庸风雅、声音亲切、彬彬有礼、眼睛似乎能洞察别人内心的年轻人。潘申具有敏锐地洞察别人情感的独特能力，很快料到自己没能得到对方的好感，便趁机找了个牵强的理由走开了。他内心暗暗地断定拉夫列茨基应该是个“很棒的人”，只是不那么讨人喜欢、难以接近，说到底，还有点儿滑稽可笑。玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜在格杰奥诺夫斯基的陪同下下来了。随后，玛尔法·季莫菲耶芙娜和莉萨也进来了。之后是家里的其他人，再接着是一位名叫别列尼岑娜夫人的音乐业余爱好者，这位女士身材瘦小，长着一张漂亮的娃娃脸，一脸倦容，穿着一条黑长裙，走起路来沙沙作响，拿着一把条纹扇，手腕上还戴着沉沉的金手镯。她的丈夫也一同前来，是个脸泛着红光的胖子，宽手大脚，白乎乎的睫毛，厚厚的嘴唇上僵硬地咧出笑容。他的妻子有别人在场时从不理睬他，可在家里撒娇时，常叫他“我的小猪猪”。潘申回来时，屋里已经满是人，人声嘈杂。拉夫列茨基对这么热闹的场面感到反感。尤其令他恼火的是，别列尼岑娜夫人不停地透过眼镜盯着他看。要不是因为莉萨，他早就立马走掉了。他盼望着能和莉萨单独聊几句，可是过了很久都没有找到合适的机会。他只好满足于凝望她时暗暗的喜悦。在他看来，莉萨的脸从未像今天这样甜美高贵。在旁边的别列尼岑娜夫人的衬托下，她显得更加花容月貌了。别列尼岑娜夫人在椅子上坐立不安，窄窄的肩头还不住地耸耸，时不时嗲兮兮地笑两声，眼睛时而眯缝时而瞪圆。莉萨坐姿安稳，目光从容，不露笑靥。卡里金夫人入了座，和玛尔法·季莫菲耶芙娜、别列尼岑娜夫人、格杰奥诺夫斯基一起打牌。格杰奥诺夫斯基总是出牌很慢，而且连连出错，皱着眉头，用手帕抹抹脸。潘申作出忧郁的神情，说一些简短、高深、沉郁的话，活脱脱像一个不得志的艺术家似的。纵使公然向他摆弄风骚的别列尼岑娜再三请求，他还是不唱他的那首歌。他觉得拉夫列茨基在这里让他很拘谨。费奥多尔·伊凡内奇也很少说话。他一进来时，他那怪异的表情就把莉萨给吓住了。她顿时感觉到他有话跟自己说，虽然她自己也说不清是为什么。但她不敢去问他。最终，她要去隔壁倒茶时，下意识地回头朝他看了一眼。他随即跟了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">The next morning, over their tea, Lemm asked Lavretsky to let him have the horses to return to town.“It’s time for me to set to work, that is, to my lessons,” observed the old man.“Besides, I am only wasting time here.”Lavretsky did not reply at once; he seemed abstracted.“Very good,” he said at last; “I will come with you myself.”Unaided by the servants, Lemm, groaning and wrathful, packed his small box and tore up and burnt a few sheets of music-paper.The horses were harnessed.As he came out of his own room, Lavretsky put the paper he had read last night in his pocket.During the whole course of the journey both Lemm and Lavretsky spoke little to one another; each was occupied with his own thoughts, and each was glad not to be disturbed by the other; and they parted rather coolly; which is often the way, however, with friends in Russia.Lavretsky conducted the old man to his little house; the latter got out, took his trunk and without holding out his hand to his friend (he was holding his trunk in both arms before his breast), without even looking at him, he said to him in Russian, “good-bye!”“Good-bye,” repeated Lavretsky, and bade the coachman drive to his lodging.He had taken rooms in the town of O－... After writing a few letters and hastily dining, Lavretsky went to the Kalitins’.In their drawing-room he found only Panshin, who informed him that Marya Dmitrievna would be in directly, and at once, with charming cordiality, entered into conversation with him.Until that day, Panshin had always treated Lavretsky, not exactly haughtily, but at least condescendingly; but Lisa, in describing her expedition of the previous day to Panshin, had spoken of Lavretsky as an excellent and clever man, that was enough; he felt bound to make a conquest of an “excellent man.”Panshin began with compliments to Lavretsky, with a description of the rapture in which, according to him, the whole family of Marya Dmitrievna spoke of Vassilyevskoe;and then, according to his custom, passing neatly to himself, began to talk about his pursuits, and his views on life, the world and government service; uttered a sentence or two upon the future of Russia, and the duty of rulers to keep a strict hand over the country; and at this point laughed light-heartedly at his own expense, and added that among other things he had been intrusted in Petersburg with the duty de poplariser l’idee du cadastre.He spoke somewhat at length, passing over all difficulties with careless self-confidence, and playing with the weightiest administrative and political questions, as a juggler plays with balls.The expressions: “That’s what I would do if I were in the government;” “you as a man of intelligence, will agree with me at once,” were constantly on his lips.Lavretsky listened coldly to Panshin’s chatter; he did not like this handsome, clever, easily-elegant young man, with his bright smile, affable voice, and inquisitive eyes.Panshin, with the quick insight into the feelings of others, which was peculiar to him, soon guessed that he was not giving his companion any special satisfaction, and made a plausible excuse to go away, inwardly deciding that Lavretsky might be an “excellent man,” but he was unattractive, aigri, and, en somme, rather absurd.Marya Dmitrievna made her appearance escorted by Gedeonovsky, then Marfa Timofyevna and Lisa came in; and after them the other members of the household; and then the musical amateur, Madame Byelenitsin, arrived, a little thinnish lady, with a languid, pretty, almost childish little face, wearing a rustling dress, a striped fan, and heavy gold bracelets.Her husband was with her, a fat red-faced man, with large hands and feet, white eye-lashes, and an immovable smile on his thick lips; his wife never spoke to him in company, but at home, in moments of tenderness, she used to call him her little sucking-pig.Panshin returned; the rooms were very full of people and noise.Such a crowd was not to Lavretsky’s taste; and he was particularly irritated by Madame Byelenitsin, who kept staring at him through her eye-glasses.He would have gone away at once but for Lisa; he wanted to say a few words to her alone, but for a long time he could not get a favourable opportunity, and had to content himself with following her in secret delight with his eyes; never had her face seemed sweeter and more noble to him.She gained much from being near Madame Byelenitsin.The latter was for ever fidgeting in her chair, shrugging her narrow shoulders, giving little girlish giggles, and screwing up her eyes and then opening them wide; Lisa sat quietly, looked directly at every one and did not laugh at all.Madame Kalitin sat down to a game of cards with Marfa Timofyevna, Madame Byelenitsin, and Gedeonovsky, who played very slowly, and constantly made mistakes, frowning and wiping his face with his handkerchief.Panshin assumed a melancholy air, and expressed himself in brief, pregnant, and gloomy phrases, played the part, in fact, of the unappreciated genius, but in spite of the entreaties of Madame Byelenitsin, who was very coquettish with him, he would not consent to sing his song; he felt Lavretsky’s presence a constraint.Fedor Ivanitch also spoke little the peculiar expression of his face struck Lisa directly he came into the room; she felt at once that he had something to tell her, and though she could not herself have said why, she was afraid to question him.At last, as she was going into the next room to pour out tea, she involuntarily turned her head in his direction.He at once went after her.</td></tr>

That “if only”—in which he had referred to the past, to the impossible had come to pass, though not as he had imagined it,—but his freedom alone was little.“She will obey her mother,” he thought, “she will marry Panshin; but even if she refuses him, won’t it be just the same as far as I am concerned?”Going up to the looking-glass he minutely scrutinised his own face and shrugged his shoulders.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">After an exhaustingly hot day, such a lovely evening had set in that Marya Dmitrievna, in spite of her aversion to a draught, ordered all the windows and doors into the garden to be thrown open, and declared that she would not play cards, that it was a sin to play cards in such weather, and one ought to enjoy nature.Panshin was the only guest.He was stimulated by the beauty of the evening, and conscious of a flood of artistic sensations, but he did not care to sing before Lavretsky, so he fell to reading poetry; he read aloud well, but too self-consciously and with unnecessary refinements, a few poems of Lermontov (Pushkin had not then come into fashion again).Then suddenly, as though ashamed of his enthusiasm, began, a propos of the well-known poem, “A Reverie,” to attack and fall foul of the younger generation.While doing so he did not lose the opportunity of expounding how he would change everything after his own fashion, if the power were in his hands. after his own fashion, if the power were in his hands.“Russia,” he said, “has fallen behind Europe; we must catch her up.It is maintained that we are young—that’s nonsense.Moreover we have no inventiveness: Homakov himself admits that we have not even invented mouse-traps.Consequently, whether we will or no, we must borrow from others.We are sick, Lermontov says—I agree with him.But we are sick from having only half become Europeans, we must take a hair of the dog that bit us (‘le cadastre,’ thought Lavretsky).”“The best head, les meilleures tetes,” he continued, “among us have long been convinced of it.All peoples are essentially alike; only introduce among them good institutions, and the thing is done.Of course there may be adaptation to the existing national life; that is our affair—the affair of the official (he almost said “governing”) class.But in case of need don’t be uneasy.The institutions will transform the life itself.”Marya Dmitrievna most feelingly assented to all Panshin said.“What a clever man,” she thought, “is talking in my drawing-room!”Lisa sat in silence leaning back against the window; Lavretsky too was silent.Marfa Timofyevna, playing cards with her old friend in the corner, muttered something to herself.Panshin walked up and down the room, and spoke eloquently, but with secret exasperation.It seemed as if he were abusing not a whole generation but a few people known to him.In a great lilac bush in the Kalitins’ garden a nightingale had built its nest; its first evening notes filled the pauses of the eloquent speech; the first stars were beginning to shine in the rosy sky over the motionless tops of the limes.Lavretsky got up and began to answer Panshin; an argument sprang up.Lavretsky championed the youth and the independence of Russia; he was ready to throw over himself and his generation, but he stood up for the new men, their convictions and desires.Panshin answered sharply and irritably.He maintained that the intelligent people ought to change everything, and was at last even brought to the point of forgetting his position as a kammer-yunker, and his career as an official, and calling Lavretsky an antiquated conservative, even hinting—very remotely it is true—at his dubious position in society.Lavretsky did not lose his temper.He did not raise his voice (he recollected that Mihalevitch too had called him antiquated but an antiquated Voltairean), and calmly proceeded to refute Panshin at all points.He proved to him the impracticability of sudden leaps and reforms from above, founded neither on knowledge of the mother-country, nor on any genuine faith in any ideal, even a negative one.He brought forward his own education as an example, and demanded before all things a recognition of the true spirit of the people and submission to it, without which even a courageous combat against error is impossible.Finally he admitted the reproach—well-deserved as he thought—of reckless waste of time and strength.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Lisa had not uttered a word in the course of the dispute between Lavretsky and Panshin, but she had followed it attentively and was completely on Lavretsky’s side.Politics interested her very little; but the supercilious tone of the worldly official (he had never delivered himself in that way before) repelled her; his contempt for Russia wounded her.It had never occurred to Lisa that she was a patriot; but her heart was with the Russian people; the Russian turn of mind delighted her; she would talk for hours together without ceremony to the peasant-overseer of her mother’s property when he came to the town, and she talked to him as to an equal, without any of the condescension of a superior.Lavretsky felt all this; he would not have troubled himself to answer Panshin by himself; he had spoken only for Lisa’s sake.They had said nothing to one another, their eyes even had seldom met.But they both knew that they had grown closer that evening, they knew that they liked and disliked the same things.and disliked the same things.On one point only were they divided; but Lisa secretly hoped to bring him to God.They sat near Marfa Timofyevna, and appeared to be following her play; indeed, they were really following it, but meanwhile their hearts were full, and nothing was lost on them; for them the nightingale sang, and the stars shone, and the trees gently murmured, lulled to sleep by the summer warmth and softness.Lavretsky was completely carried away, and surrendered himself wholly to his passion—and rejoiced in it.But no word can express what was passing in the pure heart of the young girl.It was a mystery for herself.Let it remain a mystery for all.No one knows, no one has seen, nor will ever see, how the grain, destined to life and growth, swells and ripens in the bosom of the earth.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大家已经对拉夫列茨基的成长历程和生活阅历有一定的了解了。我们来简单说说莉萨受到的教育吧。莉萨十岁时，父亲就去世了。然而，父亲从未在她身上花过很多心思。生意上的大事小事让他忙得不可开交，他所关心的永远是财产的增多。他脾性暴躁、尖刻、没耐性。他十分慷慨地给孩子们请老师、家庭教师，买新衣服和其他的生活必需品。可是，他无法忍受一点，照他的话说，就是“照看这帮闹腾不停的小家伙们”，实际上他根本没时间照看他们。他忙生意上的工作，几乎抽不出休息的时间，连觉都睡得很少，偶尔打一次牌，可不久就又开始工作了。他把自己比喻成一匹被套在打谷机上的马。弥留之际，他干涸的嘴唇露出一丝苦笑，说道：“我的一生太短暂了。”其实，玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜在莉萨身上花的心血也并没比丈夫多，尽管他跟拉夫列茨基炫耀说孩子都是她自己教育的。她把莉萨打扮得像个洋娃娃，在客人面前抚摸抚摸她的头，叫她“小机灵”或者“小心肝儿”，仅此而已。她是个很懒的女人，对任何需要不断关照的事情很快就失去耐性了。莉萨的父亲还在世时，一位从巴黎来的莫罗小姐照顾她，当她的家庭教师。他辞世之后，这个重任就落在了玛尔法·季莫菲耶芙娜的身上。大家已经知道玛尔法·德米特里耶芙娜了。而莫罗小姐个子不高，满脸褶子，有着小鸟一般的行为方式和思维。她在少年时期过得很散漫，到了老年只保留着两大嗜好——大吃大喝和赌牌。填饱了肚子后，若没有打牌或是闲聊，她的脸就会出现死灰一般的神情。她坐着，看着，呼吸着——但一眼就看出来，她在发呆。甚至都不能称她脾气温和。鸟儿是不会脾气温和的。由于她肆意地挥霍青春，抑或是她打小就呼吸着巴黎空气的缘故，她对一切都抱有一种廉价的怀疑主义。她通常会这样说：“这通通一派胡言。”她说话虽然不合语法，但确实是地道的巴黎腔。她不会说东家骂西家，也没有什么出格的行为——一个家庭女教师，人们也不会对她有更多的要求吧？她对莉萨的影响寥寥无几，更大的影响来自她的保姆阿加菲娅·弗拉西耶芙娜。</td>
		<td class="en">The reader knows how Lavretsky grew up and developed.Let us say a few words about Lisa’s education.She was in her tenth year when her father died; but he had not troubled himself much about her.Weighed down with business cares, for ever anxious for the increase of his property, bilious, sharp and impatient, he gave money unsparingly for the teachers, tutors, dress and other necessities of his children; but he could not endure, as he expressed it, “to be dandling his squallers,” and indeed had no time to dandle them.He worked, took no rest from business, slept little, rarely played cards, and worked again.He compared himself to a horse harnessed to a threshing-machine.“My life has soon come to an end,” was his comment on his deathbed, with a bitter smile on his parched lips.Marya Dmitrievna did not in reality trouble herself about Lisa any more than her husband, though she had boasted to Lavretsky that she alone had educated her children.She dressed her up like a doll, stroked her on the head before visitors and called her a clever child and a darling to her face, and that was all.Any kind of continuous care was too exhausting for the indolent lady.During her father’s lifetime, Lisa was in the hands of a governess, Mademoiselle Moreau from Paris, after his death she passed into the charge of Marfa Timofyevna.Marfa Timofyevna the reader knows already; Mademoiselle Moreau was a tiny wrinkled creature with little bird-like ways and a bird’s intellect.In her youth she had led a very dissipated life, but in old age she had only two passions left—gluttony and cards.When she had eaten her fill, and was neither playing cards nor chattering, her face assumed an expression almost death-like.She was sitting, looking, breathing—yet it was clear that there was not an idea in her head.One could not even call her good-natured.Birds are not good-natured.Either as a result of her frivolous youth or of the air of Paris, which she had breathed from childhood, a kind of cheap universal scepticism had found its way into her, usually expressed by the words: tout ca c’est des betises.She spoke ungrammatically, but in a pure Parisian jargon, did not talk scandal and had no caprices—what more can one desire in a governess?Over Lisa she had little influence; all the stronger was the influence on her of her nurse, Agafya Vlasyevna.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个女人的故事非常奇特。她出生在一个农民家庭。十六岁时，她嫁给了一个农民。不过与其他农民的女儿相比，她算是极其特殊的一个了。父亲是干了二十年的老村长，存下了很可观的一笔钱，他从小就对她娇惯有加。在整个地区，无论数美貌还是穿着打扮，她都是最杰出的。她机智敢言，很讨人喜欢。她的主人德米特里·佩斯托夫是玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜的父亲，是个谦逊温和的男人。一次，他在打谷场遇见了她，和她攀谈了之后便狂热地爱上了她。她不久就成了寡妇。佩斯托夫把她领到家里，还把她打扮成一个窈窕淑女，尽管他已经成家了。阿加菲娅很快适应了自己的新身份，似乎她以前的生活一直是这样。她变得更加漂亮丰满，她的手臂从细纱袖子里伸出来时，是那么柔滑白嫩，简直就像一双富商太太的手臂。她的桌上总是摆着一个茶炊，只穿绸缎和丝绒，而且睡觉时必须要垫一个羽绒垫子才行。这种幸福生活只持续了五年，后来德米特里·佩斯托夫去世了。他的遗孀心地善良，为了尊重故去丈夫的过去，并没有对情敌做出绝情的事，也是因为阿加菲娅从未当着她的面忘乎所以。不过，女主人还是把她许配给了一个养牲畜的农人，送她远嫁。又过了三年。一个酷热的夏日，女主人碰巧开车路过畜牧场，便停车进去看看。阿加菲娅拿出美味的冻奶款待她，毕恭毕敬，看起来干净利落、乐观快活而又很知足的样子，于是女主人决定原谅她了，还准许她回家。过了六个月，女主人变得非常依赖她，于是提升她当女管家，把管理一切家事的大权都交给了她。阿加菲娅又一次权力大握，变得白皙丰满了。女主人已经对她完全信任了。又五年过去了。不幸再一次降临到阿加菲娅身上。她把丈夫举荐到女主人家作仆人，可是他却沉迷于酗酒，甚至习惯于夜不归宿，最后还偷了主人的六把汤匙，把它们藏到了妻子的箱子中，伺机出售。后来还是被发现了。他被遣送回去继续养牲畜去了，阿加菲娅因此蒙羞。虽然她没有被女主人逐出家门，却从女管家沦落到了缝衣女仆，还被命令脱下包发帽，改包头巾。令所有人惊诧的是，阿加菲娅谦卑地认命，接受了这个晴天霹雳。正值不惑之年的她失去了所有孩子，丈夫也没能长命。是时候该看透人生了。她的确看透了。她变得少言寡语，一心向善，绝不错过任何一次晨祷或者月祷，还把自己所有的好衣服捐了出去。她安静平和、虔诚正直地度过了十五个年头，从未与人发生口角，对每个人都礼让三分。要是有人责骂她，她也只是俯首致意，感谢他们的警告。虽然女主人很久以前就宽恕她了，为她洗清了耻辱，还亲手把自己头上的包发帽摘下送予她。可她就是不愿换下头巾，还总是一袭黑衣。女主人去世之后，她变得更加平静和谦逊了。俄罗斯人很容易惧怕或者喜爱一个人，可是要让他们尊敬你却很难：受人尊敬并非唾手可得，也不是人人尽得的美事。但是阿加菲娅受到了主人家所有成员莫大的尊敬。她昔日的过错仿佛随着老主人一起归入地下，没有人再记得起来了。</td>
		<td class="en">This woman’s story was remarkable.She came of a peasant family.She was married at sixteen to a peasant; but she was strikingly different from her peasant sisters.Her father had been twenty years starosta, and had made a good deal of money, and he spoiled her.She was exceptionally beautiful, the best-dressed girl in the whole district, clever, ready with her tongue, and daring.Her master Dmitri Pestov, Marya Dmitrievna’s father, a man of modest and gentle character, saw her one day at the threshing-floor, talked to her and fell passionately in love with her.She was soon left a widow; Pestov, though he was a married man, took her into his house and dressed her like a lady.Agafya at once adapted herself to her new position, just as if she had never lived differently all her life.She grew fairer and plumper; her arms grew as “floury white” under her muslin-sleeves as a merchant’s lady’s; the samovar never left her table; she would wear nothing except silk or velvet, and slept on well-stuffed feather-beds.This blissful existence lasted for five years, but Dmitri Pestov died; his widow, a kind-hearted woman, out of regard for the memory of the deceased, did not wish to treat her rival unfairly, all the more because Agafya had never forgotten herself in her presence.She married her, however, to a shepherd, and sent her a long way off.Three years passed.It happened one hot summer day that her mistress in driving past stopped at the cattle-yard.Agafya regaled her with such delicious cool cream, behaved so modestly, and was so neat, so bright, and so contented with everything that her mistress signified her forgiveness to her and allowed her to return to the house.Within six months she had become so much attached to her that she raised her to be housekeeper, and intrusted the whole household management to her.Agafya again returned to power, and again grew plump and fair; her mistress put the most complete confidence in her.So passed five years more.Misfortune again overtook Agafya.Her husband, whom she had promoted to be a footman, began to drink, took to vanishing from the house, and ended by stealing six of the mistress’ silver spoons and hiding them till a favourable moment in his wife’s box.It was opened.He was sent to be a shepherd again, and Agafya fell into disgrace.She was not turned out of the house, but was degraded from housekeeper to being a sewing-woman and was ordered to wear a kerchief on her head instead of a cap.To the astonishment of every one, Agafya accepted with humble resignation the blow that had fallen upon her.She was at that time about thirty, all her children were dead and her husband did not live much longer.The time had come for her to reflect.And she did reflect.She became very silent and devout, never missed a single matin’s service nor a single mass, and gave away all her fine clothes.She spent fifteen years quietly, peacefully, and soberly, never quarrelling with any one and giving way to every one.If any!If any one scolded her, she only bowed to them and thanked them for the admonition.Her mistress had long ago forgiven her, raised her out of disgrace, and made her a present of a cap of her own.But she was herself unwilling to give up the kerchief and always wore a dark dress.After her mistress’ death she became still more quiet and humble.A Russian readily feels fear, and affection; but it is hard to gain his respect: it is not soon given, nor to every one.For Agafya every one in the home had great respect; no one even remembered her previous sins, as though they had been buried with the old master.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >起初，莉萨对这个一板一眼、神情严肃的新保姆心存畏惧，可不久之后，她渐渐熟悉了她，也开始喜欢她了。莉萨自己也是个严肃的孩子。她的相貌坚毅、端庄正派，有父亲卡里金的影子。她的眼睛不像父亲，明亮的眼睛里饱含着温柔的关注和善意，很少有孩子会这样。她并不喜爱洋娃娃，从不放声大笑或者长笑，举止十分稳重。她不常陷入沉思，但沉思时，一定是有某种原因。思索片刻后，她常会向大人提出一个问题，这说明之前她在思考某个新视野。她很早就过了咿呀学语的阶段，四岁时就可以清晰流利地说话了。她对父亲有些惧怕，而对母亲却有一种说不明的情愫——不惧怕也不迷恋。虽然她只对阿加菲娅存有爱恋，却同样不迷恋她。阿加菲娅从未离开她半步。俩人在一起的情景令人称奇。阿加菲娅总穿着一身黑衣，包着黑头巾，消瘦而苍白若蜡的脸依然美丽动人、表情丰富。她端坐着织袜子，莉萨则坐在她脚边的小扶椅上忙着玩什么，或者抬起清澈的双眸入神地望着阿加菲娅，听她讲些什么。阿加菲娅从未给她讲过童话故事，但会声音平稳、抑扬顿挫地给她讲圣母传，还有隐士、圣徒和圣人们的故事。她曾给莉萨讲过圣徒们如何在荒漠中生活、如何得到救赎、如何忍受饥饿和匮乏，他们不惧怕国王，只对基督耶稣虔诚坦白。她还讲过飞鸟如何为他们送来食物，野兽如何听从他们，还有他们鲜血洒过的地方是如何开出花来的。“开出了桂竹香花吗？”一次，热爱花儿的莉萨问道……阿加菲娅为莉萨讲述时显得庄重而谦逊，好像她觉得自己不够资格说这么崇高而神圣的词句一样。听着阿加菲娅的讲述，莉萨的灵魂被万物皆知的上帝那种美好的神力所渗透，饱含着圣洁而虔诚的敬畏。但对她来说，耶稣基督变得亲近而熟悉。阿加菲娅还教她如何祈祷。有时候，她会在拂晓时分把莉萨叫醒，急匆匆给她穿好衣服，便悄悄把她领去做晨祷了。莉萨几乎屏着呼吸、踮着脚尖跟在她后面。晨光初现，寒意阵阵。教堂里的清新和空荡，这些意外之旅的私密，回家躺倒小床上时的谨慎，所有这些违禁、奇特、神圣的印象交杂在一起，触动着这个小女孩，渗入她本性的最深处。阿加菲娅从不斥责任何人，莉萨顽皮淘气时，她也绝不训她。她用沉默来应对所有令她不悦的事。莉萨很是理解她这种沉默的方式。每当阿加菲娅对某些人心存不满，比如说玛丽娅·德米特里耶芙娜或是卡里金本人，莉萨也能以孩子特有的敏锐读懂她的心思。阿加菲娅照顾莉萨长达三年之多，后来莫罗小姐代替了她。然而，这个举止轻浮的法国女人，待人冷漠，动辄大惊小怪，还常常把“这通通都是胡说八道”挂在嘴边，永远也无法将莉萨心爱的保姆从她心中排挤出去。播入她心田的种子已经深深地扎根了。况且，阿加菲娅虽然没有照顾莉萨的职责了，但她仍然留在家里，常常和这个对她信赖未减的女孩见面。</td>
		<td class="en">Lisa was at first frightened by the austere and serious face of her new nurse; but she soon grew used to her and began to love her.She was herself a serious child.Her features recalled Kalitin’s decided and regular profile, only her eyes were not her father’s; they were lighted up by a gentle attentiveness and goodness, rare in children.She did not care to play with dolls, never laughed loudly or for long, and behaved with great decorum.She was not often thoughtful, but when she was, it was almost always with some reason.After a short silence, she usually turned to some grown-up person with a question which showed that her brain had been at work upon some new impression.She very early got over childish lispings, and by the time she was four years old spoke perfectly plainly.She was afraid of her father; her feeling towards her mother was undefinable, she was not afraid of her, nor was she demonstrative to her; but she was not demonstrative even towards Agafya, though she was the only person she loved.Agafya never left her.It was curious to see them together.Agafya, all in black, with a dark handkerchief on her head, her face thin and transparent as wax, but still beautiful and expressive, would be sitting upright, knitting a stocking; Lisa would sit at her feet in a little arm-chair, also busied over some kind of work, and seriously raising her clear eyes, listening to what Agafya was relating to her.And Agafya did not tell her stories; but in even measured accents she would narrate the life of the Holy Virgin, the lives of hermits, saints, and holy men.She would tell Lisa how the holy men lived in deserts, how they were saved, how they suffered hunger and want, and did not fear kings, but confessed Christ; how fowls of the air brought them food and wild beasts listened to them, and flowers sprang up on the spots where their blood had been spilt.“Wall-flowers?” asked Lisa one day, she was very fond of flowers.... Agafya spoke to Lisa gravely and meekly, as though she felt herself to be unworthy to utter such high and holy words.Lisa listened to her, and the image of the all-seeing, all-knowing God penetrated with a kind of sweet power into her very soul, filling it with pure and reverent awe; but Christ became for her something near, well-known, almost familiar.Agafya taught her to pray also.Sometimes she wakened Lisa early at daybreak, dressed her hurriedly, and took her in secret to matins.Lisa followed her on tiptoe, almost holding her breath.The cold and twilight of the early morning, the freshness and emptiness of the church, the very secrecy of these unexpected expeditions, the cautious return home and to her little bed, all these mingled impressions of the forbidden, strange, and holy agitated the little girl and penetrated to the very innermost depths of her nature.Agafya never censured any one, and never scolded Lisa for being naughty.When she was displeased at anything, she only kept silence.And Lisa understood this silence; with a child’s quick-sightedness she knew very well, too, when Agafya was displeased with other people, Marya Dmitrievna, or Kalitin himself.For a little over three years, Agafya waited on Lisa, then Mademoiselle Moreau replaced her; but the frivolous Frenchwoman, with her cold ways and exclamation, tout ca c’est des betises, could never dislodge her dear nurse from Lisa’s heart; the seeds that had been dropped into it had become too deeply rooted.Besides, though Agafya no longer waited on Lisa, she was still in the house and often saw her charge, who believed in her as before.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Agafya did not, however, get on well with Marfa Timofyevna, when she came to live in the Kalitins’ house.Such gravity and dignity on the part of one who had once worn the motley skirt of a peasant wench displeased the impatient and self-willed old lady.Agafya asked leave to go on a pilgrimage and she never came back.There were dark rumours that she had gone off to a retreat of sectaries.But the impression she had left in Lisa’s soul was never obliterated.She went as before to the mass as to a festival, she prayed with rapture, with a kind of restrained and shamefaced transport, at which Marya Dmitrievna secretly marvelled not a little, and even Marfa Timofyevna, though she did not restrain Lisa in any way, tried to temper her zeal, and would not let her make too many prostrations to the earth in her prayers; it was not a lady-like habit, she would say.In her studies Lisa worked well, that is to say perseveringly; she was not gifted with specially brilliant abilities, or great intellect; she could not succeed in anything without labour.She played the piano well, but only Lemm knew what it had cost her.She had read little; she had not “words of her own,” but she had her own ideas, and she went her own way.It was not only on the surface that she took after her father; he, too, had never asked other people what was to be done.So she had grown up tranquilly and restfully till she had reached the age of nineteen.She was very charming, without being aware of it herself.Her every movement was full of spontaneous, somewhat awkward gracefulness; her voice had the silvery ring of untouched youth, the least feeling of pleasure called forth an enchanting smile on her lips, and added a deep light and a kind of mystic sweetness to her kindling eyes.Penetrated through and through by a sense of duty, by the dread of hurting any one whatever, with a kind and tender heart, she had loved all men, and no one in particular; God only she had loved passionately, timidly, and tenderly.loved passionately, timidly, and tenderly.Lavretsky was the first to break in upon her peaceful inner life.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Ever since the morning, from the very instant when, chill with horror, she had read Lavretsky’s note, Lisa had been preparing herself for the meeting with his wife.She had a presentiment that she would see her.She resolved not to avoid her, as a punishment of her, as she called them, sinful hopes.The sudden crisis in her destiny had shaken her to the foundations.In some two hours her face seemed to have grown thin.But she did not shed a single tear.“It’s what I deserve!” she said to herself, repressing with difficulty and dismay some bitter impulses of hatred which frightened her in her soul.“Well, I must go down!” she thought directly she heard of Madame Lavretsky’s arrival, and she went down.... She stood a long while at the drawing-room door before she could summon up courage to open it.With the thought, “I have done her wrong,” she crossed the threshold and forced herself to look at her, forced herself to smile.Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her directly she caught sight of her, and bowed to her slightly, but still respectfully.“Allow me to introduce myself,” she began in an insinuating voice, “your maman is so indulgent to me that I hope that you too will be... good to me.”The expression of Varvara Pavlovna, when she uttered these last words, cold and at the same time soft, her hypocritical smile, the action of her hands, and her shoulders, her very dress, her whole being aroused such a feeling of repulsion in Lisa that she could make no reply to her, and only held out her hand with an effort.“This young lady disdains me,” thought Varvara Pavlovna, warmly pressing Lisa’s cold fingers, and turning to Marya Dmitrievna, she observed in an undertone, “mais elle est delicieuse!”Lisa faintly flushed; she heard ridicule, insult in this exclamation.But she resolved not to trust her impressions, and sat down by the window at her embroidery-frame.Even here Varvara Pavlovna did not leave her in peace.She began to admire her taste, her skill.... Lisa’s heart beat violently and painfully.She could scarcely control herself, she could scarcely sit in her place.It seemed to her that Varvara Pavlovna knew all, and was mocking at her in secret triumph.To her relief, Gedeonovsky began to talk to Varvara Pavlovna, and drew off her attention.Lisa bent over her frame, and secretly watched her.“That woman,” she thought, “was loved by him.”But she at once drove away the very thought of Lavretsky; she was afraid of losing her control over herself, she felt that her head was going round.Marya Dmitrievna began to talk of music.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Varvara Pavlovna sat down at the piano, Panshin stood by her.They sang through the duet in an undertone, and Varvara Pavlovna corrected him several times as they did so, then they sang it aloud, and then twice repeated the performance of Mira la bianca lu-u-na.Varvara Pavlovna’s voice had lost its freshness, but she managed it with great skill.Panshin at first was hesitating, and a little out of tune, then he warmed up, and if his singing was not quite beyond criticism, at least he shrugged his shoulders, swayed his whole person, and lifted his hand from time to time in the most genuine style.Varvara Pavlovna played two or three little things of Thalberg’s, and coquettishly rendered a little French ballad.Marya Dmitrievna did not know how to express her delight; she several times tried to send for Lisa.Gedeonovsky, too, was at a loss for words, and could only nod his head, but all at once he gave an unexpected yawn, and hardly had time to cover his mouth with his hand. hand.This yawn did not escape Varvara Pavlovna; she at once turned her back on the piano, observing, “Assez de musique comme ca; let us talk,” and she folded her arms.“Oui, assez de musique,” repeated Panshin gaily, and at once he dropped into a chat, alert, light, and in French.“Precisely as in the best Parisian salon,” thought Marya Dmitrievna, as she listened to their fluent and quick-witted sentences.Panshin had a sense of complete satisfaction; his eyes shone, and he smiled.At first he passed his hand across his face, contracted his brows, and sighed spasmodically whenever he chanced to encounter Marya Dmitrievna’s eyes.But later on he forgot her altogether, and gave himself up entirely to the enjoyment of a half-worldly, half-artistic chat.Varvara Pavlovna proved to be a great philosopher; she had a ready answer for everything; she never hesitated, never doubted about anything; one could see that she had conversed much with clever men of all kinds.All her ideas, all her feelings revolved round Paris.Panshin turned the conversation upon literature; it seemed that, like himself, she read only French books.George Sand drove her to exasperation, Balzac she respected, but he wearied her; in Sue and Scribe she saw great knowledge of human nature, Dumas and Feval she adored.In her heart she preferred Paul de Kock to all of them, but of course she did not even mention his name.To tell the truth, literature had no great interest for her.Varvara Pavlovna very skilfully avoided all that could even remotely recall her position; there was no reference to love in her remarks; on the contrary, they were rather expressive of austerity in regard to the allurements of passion, of disillusionment and resignation.Panshin disputed with her; she did not agree with him.... but, strange to say!...Panshin disputed with her; she did not agree with him.... but, strange to say at the very time when words of censure—often of severe censure—were coming from her lips, these words had a soft caressing sound, and her eyes spoke... precisely what those lovely eyes spoke, it was hard to say; but at least their utterances were anything but severe, and were full of undefined sweetness.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Panshin tried to interpret their secret meaning, he tried to make his own eyes speak, but he felt he was not successful; he was conscious that Varvara Pavlovna, in the character of a real lioness from abroad, stood high above him, and consequently was not completely master of himself.Varvara Pavlovna had a habit in conversation of lightly touching the sleeve of the person she was talking to; those momentary contacts had a most disquieting influence on Vladimir Nikolaitch.Varvara Pavlovna possessed the faculty of getting on easily with every one; before two hours had passed it seemed to Panshin that he had known her for an age, and Lisa, the same Lisa whom, at any-rate, he had loved, to whom he had the evening before offered his hand, had vanished as it were into a mist.Tea was brought in; the conversation became still more unconstrained.Marya Dmitrievna rang for the page and gave orders to ask Lisa to come down if her head were better.Panshin, hearing Lisa’s name, fell to discussing self-sacrifice and the question which was more capable of sacrifice—man or woman.Marya Dmitrievna at once became excited, began to maintain that woman is more the ready for sacrifice, declared that she would prove it in a couple of words, got confused and finished up by a rather unfortunate comparison.Varvara Pavlovna took up a music-book and half-hiding behind it and bending towards Panshin, she observed in a whisper, as she nibbled a biscuit, with a serene smile on her lips and in her eyes, “Elle n’a pas invente la poudre, la bonne dame.” Panshin was a little taken aback and amazed at Varvara Pavlovna’s audacity; but he did not realise how much contempt for himself was concealed in this unexpected outbreak, and forgetting Marya Dmitrievna’s kindness and devotion, forgetting all the dinners she had given him, and the money she had lent him, he replied (luckless mortal!) with the same smile and in the same tone, “je crois bien,” and not even, je crois bien, but j’crois ben!with the same smile and in the same tone, “je crois bien,” and not even, je crois bien, but j’crois ben!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Eight years had passed by.Once more the spring had come.... But we will say a few words first of the fate of Mihalevitch, Panshin, and Madame Laverestky—and then take leave of them.Mihalevitch, after long wanderings, has at last fallen in with exactly the right work for him; he has received the position of senior superintendent of a government school.He is very well content with his lot; his pupils adore him, though they mimick him too.Panshin has gained great advancement in rank, and already has a directorship in view; he walks with a slight stoop, caused doubtless by the weight round his neck of the Vladimir cross which has been conferred on him.The official in him has finally gained the ascendency over the artist; his still youngish face has grown yellow, and his hair scanty; he now neither sings nor sketches, but applies himself in secret to literature; he has written a comedy, in the style of a “proverb,” and as nowadays all writers have to draw a portrait of some one or something, he has drawn in it the portrait of a coquette, and he reads it privately to two or three ladies who look kindly upon him.He has, however, not entered upon matrimony, though many excellent opportunities of doing so have presented themselves.For this Varvara Pavlovna was responsible.As for her, she lives constantly at Paris, as in former days.Fedor Ivanitch has given her a promissory note for a large sum, and has so secured immunity from the possibility of her making a second sudden descent upon him.She has grown older and stouter, but is still charming and elegant.Every one has his ideal.Varvara Pavlovna found hers in the dramatic works of M. Dumas Fils.She diligently frequents the theatres, when consumptive and sentimental “dames aux camelias” are brought on the stage; to be Madame Doche seems to her the height of human bliss; she once declared that she did not desire a better fate for her own daughter.It is to be hoped that fate will spare Mademoiselle Ada from such happiness; from a rosy-cheeked, chubby child she has turned into a weak-chested, pale girl; her nerves are already deranged.The number of Varvara Pavlovna adorers has diminished, but she still has some; a few she will probably retain to the end of her days.The most ardent of them in these later days is a certain Zakurdalo-Skubrinikov, a retired guardsman, a full-bearded man of thirty-eight, of exceptionally vigorous physique.The French habitues of Madame Lavretsky’s salon call him “le gros taureau de l’Ukraine;” Varvara Pavlovna never invites him to her fashionable evening reunions, but he is in the fullest enjoyment of her favours.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">On the evening of which we are speaking, the inhabitants of the Kalitins’ house (the eldest of them, Lenotchka’s betrothed, was only twenty-four) were engaged in a game, which, though not of a very complicated nature, was, to judge from their merry laughter, exceedingly entertaining to them; they were running about the rooms, chasing one another; the dogs, too, were running and barking, and the canaries, hanging in cages above the windows, were straining their throats in rivalry and adding to the general uproar by the shrill trilling of their piercing notes.At the very height of this deafening merry-making a mud-bespattered carriage stopped at the gate, and a man of five-and forty, in a travelling dress, stepped out of it and stood still in amazement.He stood a little time without stirring, watching the house with attentive eyes; then went through the little gate in the courtyard, and slowly mounted the steps.In the hall he met no one; but the door of a room was suddenly!flung open, and out of it rushed Shurotchka, flushed and hot, and instantly, with a ringing shout, all the young party in pursuit of her.They stopped short at once and were quiet at the sight of a stranger; but their clear eyes fixed on him wore the same friendly expression, and their fresh faces were still smiling as Marya Dmitreivna’s son went up to the visitor and asked him cordially what he could do for him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He was answered by a shout in chorus—and not because these young people were greatly delighted at the arrival of a distant, almost forgotten relation, but simply because they were ready to be delighted and make noise at every opportunity.They surrounded Lavretsky at once; Lenotchka, as an old acquaintance, was the first to mention her own name, and assured him that in a little while she would have certainly recognised him.She presented him to the rest of the party, calling each, even her betrothed, by their pet names.They all trooped through the dining-room into the drawing-room.The walls of both rooms had been repapered; but the furniture remained the same.Lavretsky recognised the piano; even the embroidery-frame in the window was just the same, and in the same position, and it seemed with the same unfinished embroidery on it, as eight years ago.They made him sit down in a comfortable arm-chair; all sat down politely in a circle round him.Questions, exclamations, and anecdotes followed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Lavretsky went out into the garden, and the first thing that met his eyes was the very garden seat on which he had once spent with Lisa those few blissful moments, never repeated; it had grown black and warped; but he recognised it, and his soul was filled with that emotion, unequalled for sweetness and for bitterness—the emotion of keen sorrow for vanished youth, for the happiness which has once been possessed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He walked along the avenues with the young people; the lime-trees looked hardly older or taller in the eight years, but their shade was thicker; on the other hand, all the bushes had sprung up, the raspberry bushes had grown strong, the hazels were tangled thicket, and from all sides rose the fresh scent of the trees and grass and lilac.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Please, play your games,” Lavretsky hastened to interpose; “don’t pay attention to me.I shall be happier myself, when I am sure I am not in your way.And there’s no need for you to entertain me; we old fellows have an occupation which you know nothing of yet, and which no amusement can replace—our memories.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The young people listened to Lavretsky with polite but rather ironical respect—as though a teacher were giving them a lesson—and suddenly they all dispersed, and ran to the lawn; four stood near trees, one in the middle, and the game began.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拉夫列茨基回到房子里，走进了餐厅，来到钢琴前，摸了一个琴键，响起了微弱却清晰的琴声，这乐符在他心里暗暗响了起来：很久以前，在那个同样幸福的夜晚，莱姆，那位已经死去的列姆，给他弹起了鼓舞激昂的旋律，让他情不自禁，喜不自胜，那个旋律就是从这个音符开始的。然后拉夫列茨基来到了客厅，在那呆了很长时间。在那间屋子了，他过去经常看到莉萨，她的容颜无比清晰地浮现在他的面前，他好像感觉到，在他周围，处处都有她的踪迹。然而他为她感到悲伤，这份悲伤压得他难以承受，并不是死亡带来的那种平和。莉萨在某个隐蔽遥远的地方仍然活着，他想念的是那个活力四射的她，而他曾经爱着的那个女子隐藏在修女的衣服之中，周围焚着香，烟雾缭绕，在那模糊苍白的身影中，他再也找不到原来的那个她了。如果拉夫列茨基看看自己，就像他想象着看着莉萨一样，那他也会认不出自己了。在这八年的时光里，他经历了人生的那个转折点。这个转折点，很多人都没有经历过，可是没有这个转折点，任何人最后都不会成为一个好人。他真的已经不再思考他自己的幸福，也不考虑个人的目标。他已经变得冷静起来，那么——为什么要隐藏真相呢？——变老了的不仅仅是面容和身体，还有他的心，就像有些人说的那样，到老了还保持一颗年轻的心，不仅很难，而且几乎是滑稽可笑的。一个人要是没有失去对行善的信念，对意志的坚定，和对工作的热情，那他大可以感到心满意足了。拉夫列茨基大有理由感到心满意足，他的确已经成为一位出色的农场主，他真的已经学会如何种地，并且他劳动并不只是为了他自己，他竭尽全力地保护农民们的生活幸福安宁，稳定安康。</td>
		<td class="en">And Lavretsky went back into the house, went into the dining-room, drew near the piano and touched one of the keys; it gave out a faint but clear sound; on that note had begun the inspired melody with which long ago on that same happy night Lemm, the dead Lemm, had thrown him into such transports.Then Lavretsky went into the drawing-room, and for a long time he did not leave it; in that room where he had so often seen Lisa, her image rose most vividly before him; he seemed to feel the traces of her presence round him; but his grief for her was crushing, not easy to bear; it had none of the peace which comes with death.Lisa still lived somewhere, hidden and afar; he thought of her as of the living, but he did not recognize the girl he had once loved in that dim pale shadow, cloaked in a nun’s dress and encircled in misty clouds of incense.Lavretsky would not have recognized himself, could he have looked at himself, as mentally he looked at Lisa.In the course of these eight years he had passed that turning-point in life, which many never pass, but without which no one can be a good man to the end; he had really ceased to think of his own happiness, of his personal aims.He had grown calm, and—why hide the truth?—he had grown old not only in face and in body, he had grown old in heart; to keep a young heart up to old age, as some say, is not only difficult, but almost ridiculous; he may well be content who has not lost his belief in goodness, his steadfast will, and his zeal for work.Lavretsky had good reason to be content; he had become actually an excellent farmer, he had really learnt to cultivate the land, and his labours were not only for himself; he had, to the best of his powers, secured on a firm basis the welfare of his peasants.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拉夫列茨基从房子里出来，走进花园，在那个熟悉的长凳上坐了下来。在这个他珍爱的地方，面对着那栋房屋，正是在那个房屋里，他最后一次徒劳地向那个迷人的起着泡沫的酒杯伸出了他的手，那个酒杯中，金色的美酒正在闪烁欢腾，他，一个孤零零的无家可归的流浪汉，正在回顾他的一生，就在这时，耳畔传来的是这群已经取代了他的年轻一代的欢乐的欢呼声。他的心是悲凉的，可那不是沮丧，也不是痛苦。他没有什么可遗憾的，也没有什么可感到羞耻的。</td>
		<td class="en">Lavretsky went out of the house into the garden, and sat down on the familiar garden seat.And on this loved spot, facing the house where for the last time he had vainly stretched out his hand for the enchanted cup which frothed and sparkled with the golden wine of delight, he, a solitary homeless wanderer, looked back upon his life, while the joyous shouts of the younger generation who were already filling his place floated across the garden to him.His heart was sad, but not weighed down, nor bitter; much there was to regret, nothing to be ashamed of.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“尽情玩吧，高兴点，长得强大起来吧，你们是精力旺盛的年轻人！”他想着，并没有一丝辛酸，“你们的生活就摆在你们面前，对你们而言，生活会更容易些。你们不会像我们那样，得在黑暗中为自己摸索道路，得挣扎奋斗，会倒下，还得再爬起来。为了维持生活，我们吃了数不清的苦——并且我们这代人中又有多少人没熬过来呢？——不过你们只需要完成你们的职责，去努力工作，我们这些老头子会为你们祝福的。我呢，从今以后，经历过这些感情后，我还要最后一次跟你们辞别——尽管有些伤感，不过不是羡慕，也没有任何阴暗的感情，在展望人生的终点时，在看到等待着我的上帝时，只说一句：‘欢迎你，孤独的晚年！燃尽吧，无用的人生！’”</td>
		<td class="en">“Play away, be gay, grow strong, vigorous youth!” he thought, and there was no bitterness in his meditations; “your life is before you, and for you life will be easier; you have not, as we had, to find out a path for yourselves, to struggle, to fall, and to rise again in the dark; we had enough to do to last out—and how many of us did not last out?—but you need only do your duty, work away, and the blessing of an old man be with you.For me, after to-day, after these emotions, there remains to take my leave at last,—and though sadly, without envy, without any dark feelings, to say, in sight of the end, in sight of God who awaits me: ‘Welcome, lonely old age! burn out, useless life!’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拉夫列茨基轻轻的站了起来，悄悄地离开了，没有一个人注意到他，也没有一个人挽留。高高的椴树丛组成了厚厚的绿色围墙，坐落其后的花园里，那欢乐的叫喊声比以前更大了。他在四轮马车里坐下，吩咐车夫赶车回家，但是并不用快马扬鞭。</td>
		<td class="en">Lavretsky quietly rose and quietly went away; no one noticed him, no one detained him; the joyous cries sounded more loudly in the garden behind the thick green wall of high lime-trees.He took his seat in the carriage and bade the coachman drive home and not hurry the horses.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这就结束了吗？”并不满足的读者或许会问。“后来拉夫列茨基怎么样了？莉萨呢？”可是关于这些尽管还活在人世，却已经退出人生战场的人，还有什么好说的呢？有人说，拉夫列茨基去拜访了那个莉萨隐居的遥远的修道院——他还见到了她。她从一个唱诗班移到另一个唱诗班的时候，从他身边经过，她正迈着修女的步伐，那步伐大小匀称，匆匆忙忙却又温温顺顺。而且她瞥都没瞥他一眼，只是朝着他那一边的眼睫毛微微抖了一下，只把她那憔悴消瘦的面庞俯得更低了，并且她那紧握的双手的手指搓捻着念珠，攥得更紧了。他们俩在想着什么，又有什么感觉呢？谁能知道呢？谁敢说呢？人生中就是有这样的时刻，这样的感觉……只能点到为止吧——就从它们旁边走过吧。</td>
		<td class="en">“And the end?” perhaps the dissatisfied reader will inquire.“What became of Lavretsky afterwards, and of Lisa?”But what is there to tell of people who, though still alive, have withdrawn from the battlefield of life?They say, Lavretsky visited that remote convent where Lisa had hidden herself—that he saw her.Crossing over from choir to choir, she walked close past him, moving with the even, hurried, but meek walk of a nun; and she did not glance at him; only the eyelashes on the side towards him quivered a little, only she bent her emaciated face lower, and the fingers of her clasped hands, entwined with her rosary, were pressed still closer to one another.What were they both thinking, what were they feeling?Who can know?who can say?There are such moments in life, there are such feelings...One can but point to them—and pass them by.</td></tr>
