		<td class="en">“It is my right to know,” the girl said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的声音沉着有力，透着坚决。这声音里没有流露出恳求的意味，然而要达到这种坚决的效果却需要长期的恳求。但就她来说，这已经是恳求了，只不过没有表现在言语中，而在性格上。她始终双唇紧闭，但有很长一段时间，她的脸和眼睛以及她内心深处的那种态度都显现出了疑惑。这一点这个男人是知道的，但他从不回答，而现在她需要他口头回答。</td>
		<td class="en">Her voice was firm-fibred with determination.There was no hint of pleading in it, yet it was the determination that is reached through a long period of pleading.But in her case it had been pleading, not of speech, but of personality.Her lips had been ever mute, but her face and eyes, and the very attitude of her soul, had been for a long time eloquent with questioning.This the man had known, but he had never answered; and now she was demanding by the spoken word that he answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是我的权利。”女孩重复道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is my right,” the girl repeated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我明白。”他回答道，绝望而又无助。</td>
		<td class="en">“I know it,” he answered, desperately and helplessly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后一阵沉默，她等待着，眼睛注视着滤过高处的枝杈的光线，柔和而温暖的阳光洒在粗壮的红木树干上。这光线柔和而又色彩斑斓，几乎就像是从树干本身发出来的，它们用自己的色调把这光线浸染得如此之强烈。女孩似看非看，似听非听，流经远处峡谷底部的小溪发出低沉的汩汩声。</td>
		<td class="en">She waited, in the silence which followed, her eyes fixed upon the light that filtered down through the lofty boughs and bathed the great redwood trunks in mellow warmth.This light, subdued and colored, seemed almost a radiation from the trunks themselves, so strongly did they saturate it with their hue.The girl saw without seeing, as she heard, without hearing, the deep gurgling of the stream far below on the canyon bottom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她低下头看着那男人。“嗯？”她坚定地问道，自认为这男人接下来会听她的。</td>
		<td class="en">She looked down at the man.“Well?” she asked, with the firmness which feigns belief that obedience will be forthcoming.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她坐得笔直，背靠着一棵倒下的树干，而他在她身边侧躺着，一只胳膊肘撑在地上，手托着头。</td>
		<td class="en">She was sitting upright, her back against a fallen tree-trunk, while he lay near to her, on his side, an elbow on the ground and the hand supporting his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的，亲爱的卢特。”他轻声唤道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Dear, dear Lute,” he murmured.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到他的声音，她的身体微微颤抖——不是因为反感，而是在抗拒他那充满宠爱的温柔魅力。她很清楚这个男人的诱惑力——他说话时那温柔的语调，那仅是手手相触或是他在她脖子或脸颊处的微弱气息都流露出了无限的惬意与闲适。这个男人如果不用晦涩难懂的表达方式，他就没办法通过言语、神情、触觉来传达自己的信息，这种感觉就像有一只手经过，途中轻柔抚摸性地轻敲两下。这种无所不在的抚摸不是一种因太多的柔情蜜意而让人觉得腻烦的东西；不是无病呻吟,也不是为爱疯狂而伤感。而是生机勃勃，动人心弦，充满了阳刚之气。在这方面，这个男人很大程度上是没有感觉的。他只是模糊意识到这一点。这是他的一部分，可以说是他灵魂的气息，不由自主而非刻意。</td>
		<td class="en">She shivered at the sound of his voice—not from repulsion, but from struggle against the fascination of its caressing gentleness.She had come to know well the lure of the man—the wealth of easement and rest that was promised by every caressing intonation of his voice, by the mere touch of hand on hand or the faint impact of his breath on neck or cheek.The man could not express himself by word nor look nor touch without weaving into the expression, subtly and occultly, the feeling as of a hand that passed and that in passing stroked softly and soothingly.Nor was this all-pervading caress a something that cloyed with too great sweetness; nor was it sickly sentimental; nor was it maudlin with love’s madness.It was vigorous, compelling, masculine.For that matter, it was largely unconscious on the man’s part.He was only dimly aware of it.It was a part of him, the breath of his soul as it were, involuntary and unpremeditated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是现在，她下定决心，孤注一掷，使自己在他面前坚强起来。他试着面对她，但她那灰色的眼睛却坚定地朝他看过来，双眉冷静，于是他低头躺在她的膝盖上。她的手轻轻地伸进他的头发里，她的脸上逐渐浮现出关切与柔情。但是当他再次抬起头的时候，她灰色的眼睛透着趁着，眉间带着冷静和坚定。</td>
		<td class="en">But now, resolved and desperate, she steeled herself against him.He tried to face her, but her gray eyes looked out to him, steadily, from under cool, level brows, and he dropped his head upon her knee.Her hand strayed into his hair softly, and her face melted into solicitude and tenderness.But when he looked up again, her gray eyes were steady, her brows cool and level.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我还能告诉你什么？”男人说道。他抬起头，和她四目相对。“我不能和你结婚。我不能和任何女人结婚。我爱你——你知道——胜过我自己的生命。若是我把你与我生活中所有珍贵的东西作比较，你远胜过一切。为了你我可以不惜一切代价，但我不能。我不能和你结婚。我永远无法和你结婚。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What more can I tell you?” the man said.He raised his head and met her gaze.“I cannot marry you.I cannot marry any woman.I love you—you know that—better than my own life.I weigh you in the scales against all the dear things of living, and you outweigh everything.I would give everything to possess you, yet I may not.I cannot marry you.I can never marry you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她双唇紧闭，努力控制自己。她审视他时，他的头又枕在她的膝盖上。</td>
		<td class="en">Her lips were compressed with the effort of control.His head was sinking back to her knee, when she checked him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你已经结婚了吧，克里斯？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are already married, Chris?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有！没有！”他激烈地叫道，“我从没有结过婚。我只想娶你，可我做不到！”</td>
		<td class="en">“No! no!” he cried vehemently.“I have never been married.I want to marry only you, and I cannot!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别！”他打岔道，“别问我！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t!” he interrupted.“Don’t ask me!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我有权知道。”她重复道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is my right to know,” she repeated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我明白。”他又打岔道，“可是我不能告诉你。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I know it,” he again interrupted.“But I cannot tell you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你没有考虑过我，克里斯。”她继续轻声地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“You have not considered me, Chris,” she went on gently.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我明白，我明白。”他插嘴说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I know, I know,” he broke in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不可能考虑过我。你不知道我因为你，在家里承受了什么样的压力。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You cannot have considered me.You do not know what I have to bear from my people because of you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我认为他们对我的感觉不是那么不友好。”他愤愤不平地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I did not think they felt so very unkindly toward me,” he said bitterly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是真的。他们几乎无法容忍你。他们不会当着你的面表现出来，但他们几乎是憎恨你。是我不得不承担这一切。可并不总是这样。刚开始他们喜欢你就像……就像我喜欢你一样。但那是四年前的事情了。岁月流逝——一年，两年；然后他们开始变得讨厌你。他们不应受到指责。你只字不提婚事。他们觉得你在摧毁我的生活。到现在四年了，你从没向他们提起婚事。他们会怎么想？他们所想到的就是你正在毁掉我的生活。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is true.They can scarcely tolerate you.They do not show it to you, but they almost hate you.It is I who have had to bear all this.It was not always so, though.They liked you at first as...as I liked you.But that was four years ago.The time passed by—a year, two years; and then they began to turn against you.They are not to be blamed.You spoke no word.They felt that you were destroying my life.It is four years, now, and you have never once mentioned marriage to them.What were they to think?What they have thought, that you were destroying my life.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她说话的时候，继续用手指温柔地捋着他的头发，为她正遭受的痛苦而伤心。</td>
		<td class="en">As she talked, she continued to pass her fingers caressingly through his hair, sorrowful for the pain that she was inflicting.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“刚开始他们确实喜欢你。谁能刻意不喜欢你呢？你好像能让所有活的东西对你产生感情，就像这些树从地上吸取湿气一样。你身上的这种能力好像是与生俱来的。米尔德里德姑姑和罗伯特姑父认为没人能像你一样。太阳升起来照耀着你。他们认为我能赢得一个像你这样的男人的爱情，是世上最幸运的女孩了。‘因为看起来像这么回事。’罗伯特姑父过去常常顽皮地对着我摇摇头，说道。当然，他们喜欢你。米尔德里德姑姑以前常常叹息，还取笑似的瞧着姑父说：‘每当我想起克里斯，我几乎都会想自己要是年轻点多好。’姑父就会答道：‘我不怪你，亲爱的，一点儿都不。’然后他们两口子就满脸笑容地看着我，祝贺我赢得了像你这样的男人的爱情。</td>
		<td class="en">“They did like you at first.Who can help liking you?You seem to draw affection from all living things, as the trees draw the moisture from the ground.It comes to you as it were your birthright.Aunt Mildred and Uncle Robert thought there was nobody like you.The sun rose and set in you.They thought I was the luckiest girl alive to win the love of a man like you.‘For it looks very much like it,’ Uncle Robert used to say, wagging his head wickedly at me.Of course they liked you.Aunt Mildred used to sigh, and look across teasingly at Uncle, and say, ‘When I think of Chris, it almost makes me wish I were younger myself.’ And Uncle would answer, ‘I don’t blame you, my dear, not in the least.’ And then the pair of them would beam upon me their congratulations that I had won the love of a man like you.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“而且他们知道我也爱你。我如何掩藏呢？——这份伟大、美妙的感情进入了我的生活，吞噬了我所有的时光！四年了，克里斯，我只为你而活。分分秒秒都是你的。醒着，我爱你。睡着了，我梦到你。我所做的每一件事都是受你的影响，受你思想的影响。甚至我的思想也被你，被你无形的存在塑造而成。你不在我身边，不管是小的还是大的目标，我都没有。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And they knew I loved you as well.How could I hide it?—this great, wonderful thing that had entered into my life and swallowed up all my days!For four years, Chris, I have lived only for you.Every moment was yours.Waking, I loved you.Sleeping, I dreamed of you.Every act I have performed was shaped by you, by the thought of you.Even my thoughts were moulded by you, by the invisible presence of you.I had no end, petty or great, that you were not there for me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我从未想过要奴役你。”他喃喃道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I had no idea of imposing such slavery,” he muttered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你什么都没施加于我。你总是让我自主行事。你才是听话的奴隶。你这样对我，我并不生气。你先发制人，阻止了我的愿望，却一点儿不像预先阻止；它们那么自然而又不可避免，是你为我所做出的一切。我说了，我并不生气。你不是翩翩起舞的木偶。你没有小题大做。难道你不明白吗？你好像什么事情都没有做。不管怎样，它们总是理所当然地做成了。</td>
		<td class="en">“You imposed nothing.You always let me have my own way.It was you who were the obedient slave.You did for me without offending me.You forestalled my wishes without the semblance of forestalling; them, so natural and inevitable was everything you did for me.I said, without offending me.You were no dancing puppet.You made no fuss.Don’t you see?You did not seem to do things at all.Somehow they were always there, just done, as a matter of course.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这奴役是爱的奴役。正是我对你的爱让你吞噬了我所有的时光。你没有驱使自己进入我的思想。你总是悄悄地进行，你总是在那儿——程度怎样，你绝不会知道。</td>
		<td class="en">“The slavery was love’s slavery.It was just my love for you that made you swallow up all my days.You did not force yourself into my thoughts.You crept in, always, and you were there always—how much, you will never know.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是随着时间的推移，米尔德里德姑姑和姑父开始不喜欢你了。他们担心起来。我会怎么样呢？你在毁掉我的生活。我的音乐呢？你知道我的音乐梦想是怎样慢慢消失的。那个春天，我第一次遇见你的时候——我二十岁，那时我即将动身去德国。我是要努力学习的。那是四年前的事了，而我现在却仍然在加利福尼亚这儿。</td>
		<td class="en">“But as time went by, Aunt Mildred and Uncle grew to dislike you.They grew afraid.What was to become of me?You were destroying my life.My music?You know how my dream of it has dimmed away.That spring, when I first met you—I was twenty, and I was about to start for Germany.I was going to study hard.That was four years ago, and I am still here in California.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我有其他爱慕者。你把他们都赶跑了——不！不！我不是这个意思。是我把他们赶跑了。你在我身边的时候，我哪会在爱慕者，在意其他什么呢？可是就像我说的那样，米尔德里德姑姑和姑父开始担心了。还有一块儿说话的朋友，爱管闲事的人以及所有其他的人。时间一天天过去了。你还是不提婚事。我只是奇怪，奇怪。我知道你是爱我的。起初是姑父说很多不利于你的话，后来米尔德里德姑姑也说。你知道，对于我来说，他们就是父母。我不能帮你辩解。但是我对你是忠诚的。我拒绝讨论你。我避而不谈。我家里形成了半隔离状态——罗伯特姑父像个殡仪服务员一样拉着脸，而米尔德里德姑姑心都碎了。可是我能做什么呢，克里斯？我能做什么呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I had other lovers.You drove them away—No! no!I don’t mean that.It was I that drove them away.What did I care for lovers, for anything, when you were near?But as I said, Aunt Mildred and Uncle grew afraid.There has been talk friends, busybodies, and all the rest.The time went by.You did not speak.I could only wonder, wonder.I knew you loved me.Much was said against you by Uncle at first, and then by Aunt Mildred.They were father and mother to me, you know.I could not defend you.Yet I was loyal to you.I refused to discuss you.I closed up.There was half-estrangement in my home—Uncle Robert with a face like an undertaker, and Aunt Mildred’s heart breaking.But what could I do, Chris?What could I do?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这男人又把头放在她的膝盖上，含混不清地哼哼着，但没作其他回答。</td>
		<td class="en">The man, his head resting on her knee again, groaned, but made no other reply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“米尔德里德姑姑对于我来说就是妈妈，然而我却不再和她谈我的知心话。我童年的书已经合上了。那是一本充满甜蜜情意的书，克里斯。有时想起它，我就会热泪盈眶。但这没关系。我还是感到极大的幸福。我很高兴我能坦诚地说出我对你的爱。而且拥有这样的坦诚是非常甜蜜的。我真的爱你，克里斯。我爱你……我说不出是多爱你。你对于我来说就是一切，而且要更多。你记得孩提时的圣诞树吗？——当时我们玩捉迷藏，你抓住了我的胳膊，你的手指抓得那么紧，疼得我叫了起来？我从没有告诉过你，但胳膊伤得很厉害。你永远也猜不到我却因此感到那么甜蜜。那儿，青一块儿紫一块儿的，都是你的指痕——你的指痕，克里斯，你的指痕。看得出是你的碰触。一周都那样，我亲吻那些印记——哦，如此经常！我讨厌看见它们消退；我想再次把胳膊抓伤，不让淤青消退。我很害怕皮肤恢复白皙，这会使淤青褪去。不管怎样，——噢！我无法解释，但我是这么爱你！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Aunt Mildred was mother to me, yet I went to her no more with my confidences.My childhood’s book was closed.It was a sweet book, Chris.The tears come into my eyes sometimes when I think of it.But never mind that.Great happiness has been mine as well.I am glad I can talk frankly of my love for you.And the attaining of such frankness has been very sweet.I do love you, Chris.I love you...I cannot tell you how.You are everything to me, and more besides.You remember that Christmas tree of the children?—when we played blindman’s buff? and you caught me by the arm so, with such a clutching of fingers that I cried out with the hurt?I never told you, but the arm was badly bruised.And such sweet I got of it you could never guess.There, black and blue, was the imprint of your fingers—your fingers, Chris, your fingers.It was the touch of you made visible.It was there a week, and I kissed the marks—oh, so often!I hated to see them go; I wanted to rebruise the arm and make them linger.I was jealous of the returning white that drove the bruise away.Somehow,—oh!I cannot explain, but I loved you so!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两人陷入沉默，她继续抚摩他的头发，同时她漫不经心地看着一只又喧闹又有趣的灰色大松鼠在远处红杉林的景观中来回地蹦蹦跳跳。一只长着深红色羽冠的啄木鸟正精力充沛地在啄一段倒下的树干，这吸引并转移了她的视线。男人没有抬头。更确切地说，他把脸压得更靠近她的膝盖，从他起伏的双肩可以看出这个姿势令他呼吸不太顺畅。</td>
		<td class="en">In the silence that fell, she continued her caressing of his hair, while she idly watched a great gray squirrel, boisterous and hilarious, as it scampered back and forth in a distant vista of the redwoods.A crimson-crested woodpecker, energetically drilling a fallen trunk, caught and transferred her gaze.The man did not lift his head.Rather, he crushed his face closer against her knee, while his heaving shoulders marked the hardness with which he breathed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你必须告诉我，克里斯。”女孩温柔地说，“这个秘密——它要把我折磨死了。我必须知道为什么我们不能结婚。我们总是要这样吗？——仅仅是情人，经常见面，这不假，但是见面的间隔时间不长吗？这就是世界给予你和我的一切吗，克里斯？我们彼此永远不能再进一步吗？噢，只是相爱是很好，我知道——你让我非常高兴；但是有时候人会渴望得到更多的东西的！我想要你更多更多的东西，克里斯。我想要你的一切。我想要我们两个天天在一起。我想要所有的陪伴和友情，现在它们不属于我们，但我们结婚时就会属于我们了——”她很快屏住了呼吸，“可是我们永远不会结婚。我忘了。你必须告诉我原因。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You must tell me, Chris,” the girl said gently.“This mystery—it is killing me.I must know why we cannot be married.Are we always to be this way?—merely lovers, meeting often, it is true, and yet with the long absences between the meetings?Is it all the world holds for you and me, Chris?Are we never to be more to each other?Oh, it is good just to love, I know—you have made me madly happy; but one does get so hungry at times for something more!I want more and more of you, Chris.I want all of you.I want all our days to be together.I want all the companionship, the comradeship, which cannot be ours now, and which will be ours when we are married—” She caught her breath quickly.“But we are never to be married.I forgot.And you must tell me why.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男人抬起头，看着她的眼睛。这是他的方式，不管和谁说话，都看着对方的眼睛。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果有什么事……如果有障碍……如果这个谜团的确会阻止……”她说得很慢，停顿时间也很长，在为她的思想框架寻找更加恰当的说话方式。“克里斯，我真的爱你。我深深地爱着你，程度不亚于任何一个女性的爱，我敢保证。如果你现在对我说‘过来’，我就跟你走。不管你领我到哪儿，我都跟着。我愿做你的侍从，就像古时候的女人跟着她们的骑士奔赴远方一样。你是我的骑士，克里斯，而且你不会做错事。你的意愿就是我的愿望。我曾经害怕世俗的指责。既然你已经走进我的生活，我就不再害怕了。我会嘲笑世俗以及因你的缘故受的指责——也是因我的缘故。我会笑，因为我应该拥有你，你对我来说比世间的友善和赞许更重要。如果你说‘过来’，我会——”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他坐在她身边，动作显示出下定了决心。他把她的手放在他手上，紧紧地攥着。他的嘴唇动了动，正要说话。这个谜颤抖着道了出来。空气因它的出现而打颤。似乎它是不可改变的法令，女孩让自己坚强起来去听。但是男人停住了，直直地朝自己的前方看着。她感觉到他的手在她手里放松了，她就又同情又鼓励地按着它。但是她感觉到他紧张的身体已不再僵硬，而且她知道他的灵魂与肉体正一起放松。他的决心正在减退。他不会说了——她知道。她也同样清楚地知道那是因为他不能说。</td>
		<td class="en">He sat up beside her, the action stamped with resolve.He took her hand in his and held it closely.His lips moved to the verge of speech.The mystery trembled for utterance.The air was palpitant with its presence.As if it were an irrevocable decree, the girl steeled herself to hear.But the man paused, gazing straight out before him.She felt his hand relax in hers, and she pressed it sympathetically, encouragingly.But she felt the rigidity going out of his tensed body, and she knew that spirit and flesh were relaxing together.His resolution was ebbing.He would not speak—she knew it; and she knew, likewise, with the sureness of faith, that it was because he could not.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">So far removed did she seem, that she was aware of a curiosity, strangely impersonal, in what lay around her.Through a near vista she looked at a buckeye tree in full blossom as though her eyes encountered it for the first time.Her eyes paused and dwelt upon a yellow cluster of Diogenes’ lanterns that grew on the edge of an open space.It was the way of flowers always to give her quick pleasure-thrills, but no thrill was hers now.She pondered the flower slowly and thoughtfully, as a hasheesh-eater, heavy with the drug, might ponder some whim-flower that obtruded on his vision.In her ears was the voice of the stream—a hoarse-throated, sleepy old giant, muttering and mumbling his somnolent fancies.But her fancy was not in turn aroused, as was its wont; she knew the sound merely for water rushing over the rocks of the deep canyon-bottom, that and nothing more.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The horses broke into an easy lope.Chris rock on the outside, looking down into the great depths and pleasuring with his eyes in what he saw.Dissociating itself from the murmur of the bees, a murmur arose of falling water.It grew louder with every stride of the horses.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Lute leaned well out from her horse to see.Beneath them the water slid foaming down a smooth-faced rock to the lip, whence it leaped clear—a pulsating ribbon of white, a-breath with movement, ever falling and ever remaining, changing its substance but never its form, an aerial waterway as immaterial as gauze and as permanent as the hills, that spanned space and the free air from the lip of the rock to the tops of the trees far below, into whose green screen it disappeared to fall into a secret pool.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">All things tended to key them to an exquisite pitch—the movement of their bodies, at one with the moving bodies of the animals beneath them; the gently stimulated blood caressing the flesh through and through with the soft vigors of health; the warm air fanning their faces, flowing over the skin with balmy and tonic touch, permeating them and bathing them, subtly, with faint, sensuous delight; and the beauty of the world, more subtly still, flowing upon them and bathing them in the delight that is of the spirit and is personal and holy, that is inexpressible yet communicable by the flash of an eye and the dissolving of the veils of the soul.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The road curved before them, so that the upper reaches of the canyon could be seen, the distant bed of it towering high above their heads.They were rounding the curve, leaning toward the inside, gazing before them at the swift-growing picture.There was no sound of warning.She heard nothing, but even before the horse went down she experienced the feeling that the unison of the two leaping animals was broken.She turned her head, and so quickly that she saw Comanche fall.It was not a stumble nor a trip.He fell as though, abruptly, in midleap, he had died or been struck a stunning blow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在那一瞬间她想起了扶乩；这如一闪而过的闪电，灼烧着她的大脑，吞噬了她所有的记忆。她的马后退几步，她身体重量全落在缰绳上；但她转过头，注视着快要倒下的科曼齐。它正好撞在了路基上，它的腿在他身下松弛了下来，也没了活力。</td>
		<td class="en">And in that moment she remembered Planchette; it seared her brain as a lightning-flash of all-embracing memory.Her horse was back on its haunches, the weight of her body on the reins; but her head was turned and her eyes were on the falling Comanche.He struck the road-bed squarely, with his legs loose and lifeless beneath him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所有这一切都发生在几秒钟的时间内，然而这几秒却像几年那样漫长，它永恒占据了所发生的一切。科曼齐的身体撞到地上后有一些反弹，尽管很轻微但却能感觉到。猛烈的撞击使它倍感疼痛，张开嘴发出了凄惨的叫声，谁都能听到。奔跑的惯性使它前行了几步，超出了边缘。它脖子上骑手的重量在它倒下的时候先把它弄翻了。</td>
		<td class="en">It all occurred in one of those age-long seconds that embrace an eternity of happening.There was a slight but perceptible rebound from the impact of Comanche’s body with the earth.The violence with which he struck forced the air from his great lungs in an audible groan.His momentum swept him onward and over the edge.The weight of the rider on his neck turned him over head first as he pitched to the fall.</td></tr>
