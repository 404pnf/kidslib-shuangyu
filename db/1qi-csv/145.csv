"漫谈理发师","About Barbers"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"万事万物都在发展变化，但只有理发师、理发师的工作方式以及理发师的环境除外。这些从来都不会改变。一个人第一次走进理发店体验到的一切，也就是他以后在理发店一直体验到的一切，到他在人世间的日子结束都是如此。今天早晨，我像往常一样去刮胡子。我从梅音大街走到理发店门口时，一个家伙也从琼斯街走到门口——每次都是这样。我加快脚步，但一点也没用；他比我快一小步先进门，我紧跟着进去，看到他坐在唯一空着的椅子上，守在那里的是最好的一位理发师。事情总是这么不凑巧。我坐下，希望自己能坐上剩下两个当中手艺较好的理发师的椅子上，因为他已经在给客人梳头，而他的同事还在给客人搓揉头发，擦油。我十分关切地注视这一切。当我看见二号理发师进展飞快大有赶超一号的架势时，我的关心变成了担心。一号理发师停下来给新来买澡票的顾客找零钱，这使得他落后了，我悬着的心提到了嗓子眼。","All things change except barbers, the ways of barbers, and the surroundings of barbers.These never change.What one experiences in a barber shop the first time he enters one, is what he always experiences in barber shops afterward till the end of his days.I got shaved this morning as usual.A man approached the door from Jones Street as I approached it from Main—a thing that always happens.I hurried up, but it was of no use; he entered the door one little step ahead of me, and I followed in on his heels and saw him take the only vacant chair, the one presided over by the best barber.It always happens so.I sat down, hoping that I might fall heir to the chair belonging to the better of the remaining two barbers, for he had already begun combing his man’s hair, while his comrade was not yet quite done rubbing up and oiling his customer’s locks.I watched the probabilities with strong interest.When I saw that No.2 was gaining on No.1 my interest grew to solicitude.When No.1 stopped a moment to make change on a bath ticket for a new-comer, and lost ground in the race, my solicitude rose to anxiety."
"一号又赶上来的时候，他和同事同时解去毛巾，刷去残留在客人脸上的粉，谁都有可能先喊“下一位！”，我几乎紧张地屏住呼吸。但就在最后关头，一号停下来用梳子梳了梳客人的眉毛，我眼睁睁地看着他在这短短一瞬间输掉了比赛，我愤然起身走出理发店，不让自己落入二号手中；我实在没有令人羡慕的坚定，可以平静地看着一个等待顾客的理发师，却对他说我要等他的同事来服务。","When No.1 caught up again, and both he and his comrade were pulling the towels away and brushing the powder from their customers’ cheeks, and it was about an even thing which one would say “Next!” first, my very breath stood still with the suspense.But when,at the culminating moment, No.1 stopped to pass a comb a couple of times through his customer’s eyebrows, I saw that he had lost the race by a single instant, and I rose indignant and quitted the shop, to keep from falling into the hands of No. 2; for I have none of that enviable firmness that enables a man to look calmly into the eyes of a waiting barber and tell him he will wait for his fellow-barber’s chair."
"我在理发店外呆了一刻钟，又回到店里，希望运气好转。当然这时候所有的椅子上都坐满了，还有四名客人在排队，没人说话，互不理睬，一个个心烦意乱，烦躁不安，大家在理发店等待时总是那样。我坐在一张旧沙发的一个带铁扶手的座位上，浏览镜框里各种为染发烫发骗人药水所做的广告，靠这个来打发点时间。然后我看看各自香水瓶上贴着的油腻标签，看看杂物架上修面杯上的名称和标号，研究挂在墙上的那些又破又脏的廉价图片：有战争场景，早期总统的画像，苏丹王妃半躺着的性感艳照，还有令人讨厌，一成不变的女孩戴着祖父的眼镜俗不可耐的图片；我在心里咒骂着几乎所有的理发店都有欢快的金丝雀和恼人的鹦鹉。屋子中央那张脏兮兮的桌子上堆放了一堆乱糟糟的去年的插图报纸，最后，我又从中费力地挑出几张破损不太严重的，琢磨那些被人遗忘的旧事不合理的主观臆断。","I stayed out fifteen minutes, and then went back, hoping for better luck.Of course all the chairs were occupied now, and four men sat waiting, silent, unsociable, distraught, and looking bored, as men always do who are awaiting their turn in a barber’s shop.I sat down in one of the iron-armed compartments of an old sofa, and put in the time for a while, reading the framed advertisements of all sorts of quack nostrums for dyeing and coloring the hair.Then I read the greasy names on the private bayrum bottles; read the names and noted the numbers on the private shaving-cups in the pigeonholes; studied the stained and damaged cheap prints on the walls, of battles, early Presidents, and voluptuous, recumbent sultanas, and the tiresome and everlasting young girl putting her grandfather’s spectacles on; execrated in my heart the cheerful canary and the distracting parrot that few barbers’ shops are without.Finally, I searched out the least dilapidated of the last year’s illustrated papers that littered the foul center-table, and conned their unjustifiable misrepresentations of old forgotten events."
"终于轮到我了。一个声音在叫“下一位！”我当然是落到了——二号手里。事情总是这样。我怯怯地说我有点急事，他的反应就好像压根没听见。他把我脑袋向上一抬，将布围在脖子上。他把手伸进我衣领里系了条毛巾。他用手指梳了梳我的头发，示意我剪下头发。我说我并不想剪头发。他又抓抓头发，说头发太长，不适合现在的发型——最好剪短一点，特别是后边的头发。我说我上周刚刚剪过。他盯着我头发使劲想了会儿，然后轻蔑地问，谁剪的？我立即回他“你剪的！”我就等着他问呢。他开始搅拌剃须用的肥皂泡，仔细端详镜子中的自己，时不时停下手头的工作，凑上前去仔细观察自己的下巴或查看一颗粉刺。接着他在我半边脸上涂满肥皂沫，正要涂另半边脸时，两只打架的狗吸引了他的注意。他跑到窗户前站在那里看完打架，还在和其他理发师的打赌中输了两先令，这让我觉得很痛快。他给我打完肥皂沫，这期间他把刷子伸进我嘴里只有两次，接着开始用手在我脸上搓啊搓；这时他把头转向一边，和其他理发师谈论刚才打架的狗，他很自然地把一堆肥皂沫挖进我嘴里，但他并不知道，可是我知道。","At last my turn came.A voice said “Next!” and I surrendered to—No. 2, of course.It always happens so.I said meekly that I was in a hurry, and it affected him as strongly as if he had never heard it.He shoved up my head, and put a napkin under it.He ploughed his fingers into my collar and fixed a towel there.He explored my hair with his claws and suggested that it needed trimming.I said I did not want it trimmed.He explored again and said it was pretty long for the present style—better have a little taken off; it needed it behind, especially.I said I had had it cut only a week before.He yearned over it reflectively a moment, and then asked, with a disparaging manner, who cut it?I came back at him promptly with a “You did!”I had him there.Then he fell to stirring up his lather and regarding himself in the glass, stopping now and then to get close and examine his chin critically or inspect a pimple.Then he lathered one side of my face thoroughly, and was about to lather the other, when a dog-fight attracted his attention, and he ran to the window and stayed and saw it out, losing two shillings on the result in bets with the other barbers, a thing which gave me great satisfaction.He finished lathering, meantime getting the brush into my mouth only twice, and then began to rub in the suds with his hand; and as he now had his head turned, discussing the dog fight with the other barbers, he naturally shovelled considerably lather into my mouth without knowing it, but I did."
"现在他开始在一条旧磨刀布上打磨剃须刀，由于他在讨论他昨晚参加的一个低档次的假面舞会，所以耽搁了好一会儿，他穿着红色亚麻衣服和假貂皮，假扮某个国王的样子。同事调侃他说舞会上有个少女为他的魅力所倾倒，他感到很满足，但他假装被同事惹恼，用各种办法来继续这场争论。这件事进一步促使他到镜子前观察自己，他放下手中的剃须刀，小心翼翼地梳理自己的头发，把前面头发弯成倒弓型贴在前额上，将后面的头发精确地“分了出去”，把两边的鬓发梳到耳前，仔仔细细地将其别在耳朵上面。与此同时，我脸上的肥皂沫渐渐干了，似乎在慢慢渗入我的血管里。","He now began to sharpen his razor on an old suspender, and was delayed a good deal on account of a controversy about a cheap masquerade ball he had figured at the night before, in red cambric and bogus ermine, as some kind of a king.He was so gratified with being chaffed about some damsel whom he had smitten with his charms that he used every means to continue the controversy by pretending to be annoyed at the chaffings of his fellows.This matter begot more surveyings of himself in the glass, and he put down his razor and brushed his hair with elaborate care, plastering an inverted arch of it down on his forehead, accomplishing an accurate “part” behind, and brushing the two wings forward over his ears with nice exactness.In the mean time the lather was drying on my face, and apparently eating into my vitals."
"这时他才开始给我刮脸，把手指按到我面部拉紧皮肤，时不时捏下我鼻子，顺手根据刮胡子的需要把我头拨来拨去。如果他只整我脸上两边皮厚的地方我还不受罪；但当他开始对我的下巴又拧又扯又扒，我的眼泪就出来了。接下来，他一把拧住我得鼻子，帮他刮我上嘴唇角落的胡须，就是这个娴熟的动作让我发现他在店里还有一个工作，就是清洗煤油灯。我以前常常纳闷，真不清楚这工作到底是由理发师们干还是老板亲自动手。","Now he began to shave, digging his fingers into my countenance to stretch the skin,make a handle of nose now and then, and bundling and tumbling my head this way and that as convenience in shaving demanded.As long as he was on the tough sides of my face I did not suffer; but when he began to rake, and rip, and tug at my chin, the tears came.He now made a handle of my nose, to assist him shaving the corners of my upper lip, and it was by this bit of circumstantial evidence that I discovered that a part of his duties in the shop was to clean the kerosene-lamps.I had often wondered in an indolent way whether the barbers did that, or whether it was the boss."
"这个时候我正暗自琢磨试图猜他这次最可能冲哪里下手，他没等我来得及猜，就在下巴尖上划了个口子，我这才回过神来。他赶紧去磨剃须刀——他这之前早就该去磨。我一点不喜欢刮得太仔细，更不想让他再来第二遍。我试着劝他收起剃须刀，害怕他会刮我下巴侧面，那是我脸上最娇嫩的地方，那地方剃须刀要是刮两次不可能不出事；但他说他只想把我脸上一小块粗糙的地方修理平整，说着他立即把剃须刀放在禁区了，之前刮得太净残留的青春痘疤又被揭开，一阵刺痛。这时他把毛巾一头浸在月桂液里，再拿出来“啪”的一声狠狠地盖在我脸上；这样一下子拍住脸好像人本来就是这样洗脸的。之后，他为了给我擦干脸又“啪”的一下把毛巾干的一头甩到我脸上，好像人就是这样擦干脸的；毕竟理发师很少像基督徒受洗那样抚摸你。接着他用毛巾蘸着月桂液戳我的伤口，又用粉状物按住伤口，又拿月桂液浸湿伤口，他会一直这样一会儿浸湿一会儿堵住的，毫无悬念，如果不是我不反抗不求饶的话。他现在把我整个脸上都扑了粉，扶我坐直，开始若有所思地用手捋我的头发。接着他向我建议一款洗发香波，说我的头发需要，非常、非常需要。我仔细看了下确信我昨天洗澡时已经用它好好地洗过了。我又“等着他问我呢”。他接下来向我推荐“史密斯美发系列”用品并提出卖给我一瓶。我谢绝了。他开始夸赞一款新的清新剂——“琼斯洁厕清新剂”，有意卖给我几瓶。我再次谢绝。他提议我买他自己发明的漱口水，我谢绝后，他提出和我做小刀生意。","About this time I was amusing myself trying to guess where he would be most likely to cut me this time, but he got ahead of me, and sliced me on the end of the chin before I had got my mind made up.He immediately sharpened his razor—he might have done it before.I do not like a close shave, and would not let him go over me a second time.I tried to get him to put up his razor, dreading that he would make for the side of my chin, my pet tender spot, a place which a razor cannot touch twice without making trouble; but he said he only wanted to just smooth off one little roughness, and in the same moment he slipped his razor along the forbidden ground, and the dreaded pimple-signs of a close shave rose up smarting and answered to the call.Now he soaked his towel in bay rum, and slapped it all over my face nastily; slapped it over as if a human being ever yet washed his face in that way.Then he dried it by slapping with the dry part of the towel, as if a human being ever dried his face in such a fashion; but a barber seldom rubs you like a Christian.Next he poked bay rum into the cut place with his towel, then choked the wound with powdered starch, then soaked it with bay rum again, and would have gone on soaking and powdering it forevermore, no doubt, if I had not rebelled and begged off.He powdered my whole face now, straightened me up, and began to plow my hair thoughtfully with his hands.Then he suggested a shampoo, and said my hair needed it badly, very badly.I observed that I shampooed it myself very thoroughly in the bath yesterday.I “had him” again.He next recommended some of “Smith’s Hair Glorifier,” and offered to sell me a bottle.I declined.He praised the new perfume, “Jones’s Delight of the Toilet,” and proposed to sell me some of that.I declined again.He tendered me a tooth-wash atrocity of his own invention, and when I declined, offered to trade knives with me."
"他重新给我理发，因为最后这笔交易也流产了。他给我全身喷香水，腿上和浑身都喷；他给我的头发上油，也不顾我强烈的反对，又使劲搓揉头发，把很多头发连根搓揉出来，再把剩下的头发梳一梳理一理，向后分开，把最终的倒弓形的头发放下来贴在我额头上；接着，他一边梳我稀疏的眉毛，将它们排列一纵队，一边极力夸赞他那条六盎司重黑棕相间的小狗所取得的丰功伟绩，直到我听到了中午报时的汽笛鸣响，我知道我已经晚点五分，赶不上火车了。接着他突然把毛巾拿开，在我脸上轻轻扫了几下，用梳子梳了下我的眉毛，又一次，快活地唱着“下一位！”。","He returned to business after the miscarriage of this last enterprise, sprinkled me all over, legs and all, greased my hair in defiance of my protest against it, rubbed and scrubbed a good deal of it out by the roots, and combed and brushed the rest, parting it behind, and plastering the eternal inverted arch of hair down on my forehead, and then, while combing my scant eyebrows and defiling them with pomade, strung out an account of the achievements of a six-ounce black-and-tan terrier of his till I heard the whistles blow for noon, and knew I was five minutes too late for the train.Then he snatched away the towel, brushed it lightly about my face, passed his comb through my eyebrows once more, and gaily sang out “Next!”"
"这个理发师突然摔倒，两个小时后，中风死了。我要多留一天出这口恶气——我要参加他的葬礼。","This barber fell down and died of apoplexy two hours later.I am waiting over a day for my revenge—I am going to attend his funeral."
