		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有那么两三件事是我一直想知道的。我可不在乎是不是秘密。于是我就开始打听了。</td>
		<td class="en">There were two or three things that I wanted to know.I do not care about a mystery.So I began to inquire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我花了两个星期的时间弄清楚女人都在衣箱里装了些什么。然后我开始置疑床垫为什么是由两部分组成的。这个严肃的问题最开始惹来了一些疑虑，因为它听起来就像是一个无解谜题。我最终确信，之所以床要被设计成双层结构是为了减轻女性的负担，毕竟她们是要负责整理床铺的。我傻乎乎的，竟固执地巴望着能明白为什么两部分的大小会不一样；这个问题始终不得解。</td>
		<td class="en">It took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases.And then I began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces.This serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum.I was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman, who makes up beds.I was so foolish as to persist, begging to know why, then, they were not made in two equal pieces; whereupon I was shunned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我渴望从知识宝库中得到启示的第三件事是关于那个被称作“城市佬”的人物。作为一个典型，他在我的脑海中显得过于模糊。在理解任何事物之前，我们都必须对它有一个切实的认识，哪怕只是一个假设的概念。这会儿，我在心里想象着某个小瘪三，画面清晰得就像钢板雕刻的一般。他有一双浅蓝色的眼睛，穿一件棕色背心和一件闪亮的黑色哔叽外套。他总是站在阳光下，嘴里嚼着什么，并且不停地把他的折叠小刀先半阖起来，再用拇指把它打开。此外，倘若找到他们的头头儿，我敢保证，那一定是个大块头的、脸色苍白的男人；他袖口下面露出蓝色的手链，坐在听得到保龄球道声音的地方让人为他擦皮鞋，而且他身上必定有什么地方镶着绿松石。</td>
		<td class="en">The third draught that I craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as A Man About Town.He was more vague in my mind than a type should be.We must have a concrete idea of anything, even if it be an imaginary idea, before we can comprehend it.Now, I have a mental picture of John Doe that is as clear as a steel engraving.His eyes are weak blue; he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat.He stands always in the sunshine chewing something; and he keeps half-shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb.And, if the Man Higher Up is ever found, take my assurance for it, he will be a large, pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs, and he will be sitting to have his shoes polished within sound of a bowling alley, and there will be somewhere about him turquoises.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是当我打算描绘城市佬的时候，我想象的画布却一片空白。我想象他有着机械的嗤笑表情（类似柴郡猫的那种微笑），带着可脱卸的袖口，仅此而已。于是，我向一个新闻记者问起有关城市佬的事。</td>
		<td class="en">But the canvas of my imagination, when it came to limning the Man About Town, was blank.I fancied that he had a detachable sneer (like the smile of the Cheshire cat) and attached cuffs; and that was all.Whereupon I asked a newspaper reporter about him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唔，”他说，“‘城市佬’是介于‘无业游民’和‘纨绔子弟’之间的角色。他不确定——嗯，他适合呆在介于菲什夫人的宴会和私人拳击赛场之间的场合。他并不——嗯，他既不属于莲花俱乐部，也不是杰利·麦克盖根白铁学徒工左勾拳杂烩联盟的成员。我不知道如何确切地跟你描述出这种人。随便有点儿什么事发生的地方，你都能见得到他。不错，我想这类人是一种典型。每晚穿着正装，熟悉各种内慕，无论叫城里的哪个警察和服务员都是直呼其名。不，他从不跟女性一同外出。你通常会见到他独来独往，要么就是跟另一位男士在同行。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why,” said he, “a ‘Man About Town’ something between a ‘rounder’ and a ‘clubman.’He isn’t exactly—well, he fits in between Mrs. Fish’s receptions and private boxing bouts.He doesn’t—well, he doesn’t belong either to the Lotos Club or to the Jerry McGeogheghan Galvanised Iron Workers’ Apprentices’ Left Hook Chowder Association.I don’t exactly know how to describe him to you.You’ll see him everywhere there’s anything doing.Yes, I suppose he’s a type.Dress clothes every evening; knows the ropes; calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names.No; he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives.You generally see him alone or with another man.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的这个记者朋友离开了我，我继续向前逛。此时，百老汇剧场街的三千一百二十六盏电灯都已点亮。人们从我身边经过，却不能让我停下脚步。淫荡的眼神投射到我身上，但离开时我毫发无损。赴晚餐的人、回家的人、女店员、骗子、乞丐、演员、强盗、百万富翁和外地人，他们有的急匆匆，有的仓皇，有的悠闲，有的蹑手蹑脚，有的大摇大摆，还有的急急忙忙地走过我身边，可我谁也没有留意。我了解他们所有人，我看透了他们的心思，他们对我都毫无用处。我想要属于我的城市佬。他是一个活体典型，就像排字工手中的活铅字，漏掉他就会造成错误——手民误植——但是算了！让我们继续吧。</td>
		<td class="en">My friend the reporter left me, and I wandered further afield.By this time the 3126 electric lights on the Rialto were alight.People passed, but they held me not.Paphian eyes rayed upon me, and left me unscathed.Diners, heimgangers, shop-girls, confidence men, panhandlers, actors, highwaymen, millionaires and outlanders hurried, skipped, strolled, sneaked, swaggered and scurried by me; but I took no note of them.I knew them all; I had read their hearts; they had served.I wanted my Man About Town.He was a type, and to drop him would be an error—a typograph—but no! Let us continue.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >让我们用一点伦理方面的题外话继续下去。去瞧瞧一家人阅读周日报纸正好合意。各个版块都已经分崩离析了。爸爸急着看的那一页的图片上，一个年轻姑娘正在敞开的窗边健身，并且弯下了腰——可是，好吧，好吧！妈妈正兴致勃勃地试着猜出“_丑 _勺”那两个空格里该补上什么偏旁部首。大女儿热衷于浏览财经新闻，因为上周日晚上某个年轻人说过他会孤注一掷，把所有资金都投到Q. X. &Z.公司的股票上去。读纽约公立学校的十八岁的小儿子威利，正沉浸在每周一刊介绍如何改造旧衬衫的文章里，希望能够在毕业那天拿个缝纫奖。</td>
		<td class="en">Let us continue with a moral digression.To see a family reading the Sunday paper gratifies.The sections have been separated.Papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window, and bending—but there, there!Mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word N—w Yo—k.The oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports, for a certain young man remarked last Sunday night that he had taken a flyer in Q., X. & Z.Willie, the eighteen-year-old son, who attends the New York public school, is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old shirt, for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >奶奶把着连环漫画副刊看了两个钟头了；还是个婴儿的小托蒂正躺在房地产转让版上左摇右摆。这个场景是为了让大家放心，因为这个故事有几行最好还是跳过去。因为下面引出的将是烈性饮料。</td>
		<td class="en">Grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two-hours’ grip; and little Tottie, the baby, is rocking along the best she can with the real estate transfers.This view is intended to be reassuring, for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped.For it introduces strong drink.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我走进一家小酒馆——苏格兰威士忌还在调制的时候，我向那个立刻拾起你刚放下的调酒匙的调酒师问起他是否理解这样一个名词、尊号、类型、称呼、描述或者名号——“城市佬”。</td>
		<td class="en">I went into a café to—and while it was being mixed I asked the man who grabs up your hot Scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he understood by the term, epithet, description, designation, characterisation or appellation, viz.: a “Man About Town.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唔，”他小心翼翼地说，“这是指那种精明的家伙，即使被人劝一晚上酒都还保持理智——你知道？那可是老油条，无论在熨斗大厦哪一层都碰不了壁——明白吗？我猜就是这个意思吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why,” said he, carefully, “it means a fly guy that’s wise to the all-night push—see?It’s a hot sport that you can’t bump to the rail anywhere between the Flatirons—see?I guess that’s about what it means.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我谢了他，走了出来。</td>
		<td class="en">I thanked him and departed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人行道上一个救世军小姑娘冲着我的背心口袋轻轻地摇着她的募捐箱。</td>
		<td class="en">On the sidewalk a Salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你能不能告诉我，”我问她，“你每天到处转悠的时候有没有见过通常被称为‘城市佬’的人？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Would you mind telling me,” I asked her, “if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as ‘A Man About Town’ during your daily wanderings?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想我知道你说的是什么人。”她温柔地一笑，答道，“我们每晚都能在同样的地点见到他们。他们是魔鬼的贴身保镖，如果哪个部队的士兵能像他们一样忠诚，他们的指挥官就有福了。我们来到他们中间，从他们的罪恶里刨几个小钱来服务上帝。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think I know whom you mean,” she answered, with a gentle smile.“We see them in the same places night after night.They are the devil’s body guard, and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are, their commanders are well served.We go among them, diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the Lord’s service.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她又一次摇晃起那个募捐箱，我扔了一个十美分硬币进去。</td>
		<td class="en">She shook the box again and I dropped a dime into it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在一栋富丽堂皇的酒店前，我的一个朋友，一位批评家，正从一辆出租马车里钻出来。他看起来正闲，我就把我的问题又抛给了他。他正如我所确信的那样，认认真真地回答了我。</td>
		<td class="en">In front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing from a cab.He seemed at leisure; and I put my question to him.He answered me conscientiously, as I was sure he would.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“纽约确实有‘城市佬’这么一类人。”他答道，“这个名词对我来说太熟悉了，但想来，之前还从来没人请求我去给这类人物下个定义。给你指出一个确切的样本应该挺困难的。让我随口说说，我会说那种人是无药可救的患者，患着爱看热闹、爱打听这一独特的纽约城市病。对他来说，每天的生活六点就开始了。他的衣着举止严格地依照时下风习，但在管一些自己不该管的闲事方面，他简直可以给善于追踪的灵猫或者寒鸦提供线索了。这种人过着那种放荡不羁的都市生活，从地下酒吧到屋顶花园，从西斯特街到哈莱姆区。在这座城市里你找不出一处地方没有他们用餐刀切着意大利细面条的身影。你所说的‘城市佬’做的就是那样的事情。他总是追踪着新鲜的事物。他是好奇的、冒失的、无所不在的。他只乘坐汉萨姆马车，抽箍着金色烟标的雪茄，总在晚饭时诅咒餐厅的音乐。这种人为数不多，可是他们这一小部分人的意见却四处得到采纳。</td>
		<td class="en">“There is a type of ‘Man About Town’ in New York,” he answered.“The term is quite familiar to me, but I don’t think I was ever called upon to define the character before.It would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen.I would say, offhand, that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar New York disease of wanting to see and know.At 6 o’clock each day life begins with him.He follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners; but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw.He is the man who has chased Bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from Hester street to Harlem until you can’t find a place in the city where they don’t cut their spaghetti with a knife.Your ‘Man About Town’ has done that.He is always on the scent of something new.He is curiosity, impudence and omnipresence.Hansoms were made for him, and gold-banded cigars; and the curse of music at dinner.There are not so many of him; but his minority report is adopted everywhere.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我很高兴你提起这个话题，我已经觉到这种夜间活动的病菌对我们城市的侵扰，可之前从没想过去分析它。现在我看得出你所说的‘城市佬’早就该被归类了。随着他们的出现，大批葡萄酒经销商和服装模特迅速兴起；在他们的要求之下，乐队也以演奏《让我们都去莫德家》这样的流行歌曲取代了亨德尔的古典音乐。他们每夜四处闲逛，而你我每周只有一次机会去开开眼。当雪茄烟铺遭到突袭搜查的时候，他们只要冲熟悉他们底细的警官使个眼色，就可以免于盘查，扬长而去，而你我就得夹在一群会长、明星之类的人物中间去警局把姓名和住址报给内勤警官。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m glad you brought up the subject; I’ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city, but I never thought to analyse it before.I can see now that your ‘Man About Town’ should have been classified long ago.In his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models; and the orchestra plays ‘Let’s All Go Up to Maud’s’ for him, by request, instead of Händel.He makes his rounds every evening; while you and I see the elephant once a week.When the cigar store is raided, he winks at the officer, familiar with his ground, and walks away immune, while you and I search among the Presidents for names, and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的这个批评家朋友停下来吸了口气，打算继续长篇大论下去。我赶紧抓住机会。</td>
		<td class="en">My friend, the critic, paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence.I seized my advantage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你已经把这种人界定出来了。”我开心地叫道，“你已经在城市典型的画廊里绘出他们的肖像了。但我必须得当面见一个。我必须通过第一手资料研究城市佬。我从哪儿能找到他们呢？我怎么才能认出他们呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You have classified him,” I cried with joy.“You have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types.But I must meet one face to face.I must study the Man About Town at first hand.Where shall I find him?How shall I know him?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >批评家像是没听见我的话，继续说了下去。他的出租马车夫也还在等他付账。</td>
		<td class="en">Without seeming to hear me, the critic went on.And his cab-driver was waiting for his fare, too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们是多管闲事的理想精华，是招惹麻烦的天然纯萃，是好奇心和包打听的一心一意、毫无杂质、无可争辩、无法避免的神髓。发掘新的感受对他们就像让呼吸出入鼻孔一般容易；当之前的那些新鲜感都被他们消耗殆尽，他们便开始不屈不挠地探索一个新的领域——”</td>
		<td class="en">“He is the sublimated essence of Butt-in; the refined, intrinsic extract of Rubber; the concentrated, purified, irrefutable, unavoidable spirit of Curiosity and Inquisitiveness.A new sensation is the breath in his nostrils; when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不好意思，”我打断道，“但你能不能举一个例子？这对我是个新鲜事物。我必须得研究研究。我会找遍整个城市，直到我把他们找到。他们的大本营一定在这儿，在百老汇路上。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Excuse me,” I interrupted, “but can you produce one of this type?It is a new thing to me.I must study it.I will search the town over until I find one.Its habitat must be here on Broadway.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我马上要在这儿吃饭。”我的朋友说，“进来吧，如果在那儿有个城市佬出现的话，我会给你指出来。这儿的常客我几乎都认识。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am about to dine here,” said my friend.“Come inside, and if there is a Man About Town present I will point him out to you.I know most of the regular patrons here.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我这会儿还没准备吃晚饭。”我对他说，“恕我不能奉陪了。即便是要从炮台公园到小科尼岛游乐场，把纽约城翻个底儿朝天，今晚我也要把城市佬找出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am not dining yet,” I said to him.“You will excuse me.I am going to find my Man About Town this night if I have to rake New York from the Battery to Little Coney Island.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我离开酒店，走到百老汇路上。对这一典型人物的搜寻给我呼吸的空气增添了一份生活的情趣和乐趣。我很高兴身处于这样一座巨大、复杂又多样化的城市。我悠闲地摆着谱漫步着，满心想着自己是这个大纽约城的一名公民，分享着它的繁华乐事，它的声名与荣耀，感觉自己简直要膨胀起来了。</td>
		<td class="en">I left the hotel and walked down Broadway.The pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savor of life and interest to the air I breathed.I was glad to be in a city so great, so complex and diversified.Leisurely and with something of an air I strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that I was a citizen of great Gotham, a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures, a partaker in its glory and prestige.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我转身准备穿过马路。我听到有什么像蜜蜂一样嗡鸣着，然后就随桑托斯—杜蒙特做了次愉快的长途飞行。</td>
		<td class="en">I turned to cross the street.I heard something buzz like a bee, and then I took a long, pleasant ride with Santos-Dumont.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我记得等我睁开眼，还闻到一股汽油味，于是我大喊道：“车还没过去吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">When I opened my eyes I remembered a smell of gasoline, and I said aloud: “Hasn’t it passed yet?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个护士把她并不特别柔软的手放到我根本就没发热的额头上。一位年轻的医生走过来，咧嘴一笑，递给我一份早报。</td>
		<td class="en">A hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered.A young doctor came along, grinned, and handed me a morning newspaper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“想知道是怎么回事吧？”他愉快地问道。我读了那篇报道。头条新闻是从昨晚我听到的那阵嗡鸣声停止开始写起的。结尾处是这样几行：</td>
		<td class="en">“Want to see how it happened?” he asked cheerily.I read the article.Its headlines began where I heard the buzzing leave off the night before.It closed with these lines: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“——来自贝尔维尤医院的消息，称他的伤势并不严重。伤者似乎是个典型的城市佬。”</td>
		<td class="en">“—Bellevue Hospital, where it was said that his injuries were not serious.He appeared to be a typical Man About Town.”</td></tr>
