		<td class="en">唯一给我留下印象，或者说唯一会给我留下印象的，是第一次博览会，它可是博览会的鼻祖。现在看来，它已经算是旧时的事物了——那就是1851年在伦敦海德公园举办的万国工业博览会。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">这些话题引领我们去谈论各种高低贵贱的人物，他们在当时狭窄、平静的领域中生活、奔波和忙碌。这里要特别谈到三个人，他们不寻常的生活经历和万国工业博览会有些奇妙的联系。而且，与斯蒂克福德、梅尔斯托克、埃格顿等偏远地区的其他人相比，他们的生活经历和万国工业博览会的联系要紧密得多。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">他是乐师、花花公子，也是一名在职的公司雇员；他懂些兽医知识，在梅尔斯托克村住过一阵子，谁都不知道他家乡是哪里；不过有人说他第一次在这附近亮相就是在格林希尔博览会上，他在一次表演中担任小提琴手。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Many a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated maidenhood—a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird and wizardly in it.</td>
		<td class="en">很多正派的村民都很羡慕他，因为他对不谙世事的女孩有着一种吸引力——这种吸引力有时似乎带有一丝怪异而神奇的色彩。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-English, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather clammy—made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came fresh to a party, caused him to smell like ‘boys’-love’ (southernwood) steeped in lamp-oil.</td>
		<td class="en">就其个人而言，他长得并不难看，尽管他不太像英国人。他的肤色是深橄榄色的，头发很多，又黑又油腻——抹了神秘的油膏后就更加油腻了，这使得他刚出现在聚会时，闻起来像浸在灯油中的青蒿似的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >On occasion he wore curls—a double row—running almost horizontally around his head.</td>
		<td class="en">有时他留卷发——卷成两层——几乎在他的脑袋上水平地绕一周。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had been nicknamed ‘Mop,’ from this abundance of hair, which was long enough to rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more prevailed.</td>
		<td class="en">由于他的头发非常浓密，长及肩膀，那些对他由爱生恨的女孩们给他起了个绰号“大拖把”。时间一长，这绰号就流传开了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >His fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he exercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most peculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher.</td>
		<td class="en">他的魅力可能与其琴技关系最大。因为平心而论，他的琴技本身极其特别，很有个性，正如牧师那令人感动的布道一样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There were tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and averseness to systematic application were all that lay between ‘Mop’ and the career of a second Paganini.</td>
		<td class="en">他拉出的曲调让人立刻相信，若不是懒惰成性，反感系统训练，“大拖把”就能成为帕格尼尼第二了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >While playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it were, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive passages ever heard by rustic man.</td>
		<td class="en">演奏时，他总是闭着眼睛。他不用谱子，似乎在让小提琴任意发挥，奏出乡下人从未听过的哀伤乐曲。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There was a certain lingual character in the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have drawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post.</td>
		<td class="en">他奏出的曲子有一种类似人声的特质，诉说着心中的祈求，就连门柱听了都会心痛难安。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He could make any child in the parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few minutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely affected—country jigs, reels, and ‘Favourite Quick Steps’ of the last century—some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless phantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by the curious, or by such old-fashioned and far-between people as have been thrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.</td>
		<td class="en">仅需拉一首古老的舞曲，他就可以使教区里稍有音乐天赋的孩子在几分钟内大哭起来。他喜欢几乎所有古老的舞曲——上世纪的乡村吉格舞曲、里尔舞曲以及“流行快步舞曲”。现在，其中一些残缺不全的乐曲片段甚至像无名的幽灵一样，重新出现在新的四对方舞曲和加洛普舞曲中。而只有那些有好奇心的人，或者那些早年和沃特·奥拉莫尔之类的人交往过的因循守旧的少数人才会辨认得出。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >His date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band which comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest—in fact, he did not rise above the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were disbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries.</td>
		<td class="en">他所处的年代比梅尔斯托克的老唱诗班乐团要晚一点儿，其成员包括德维兄弟、梅尔等人。实际上，直到那些著名乐师们不再为教会供职后，他才开始崭露头角。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >In their honest love of thoroughness they despised the new man’s style.</td>
		<td class="en">那些乐师挚爱严谨，因而他们瞧不上这个新来的人的风格。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Theophilus Dewy (Reuben the tranter’s younger brother) used to say there was no ‘plumness’ in it—no bowing, no solidity—it was all fantastical.</td>
		<td class="en">西奥菲勒斯·德维（流动商贩鲁本的弟弟）曾经说他的琴技毫不“体面”——不运弓法、连续性差——完全荒诞不稽。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And probably this was true.</td>
		<td class="en">这话也许不假。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-music from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock church where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many hundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all.</td>
		<td class="en">无论如何，显然，“大拖把”从出生起就从未演奏过一次教堂音乐；他从未坐在梅尔斯托克教堂的边座上，而其他人曾在那里把庄严的赞美诗奏唱过几百次。他很可能根本没进过教堂。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >All were devil’s tunes in his repertory.</td>
		<td class="en">他的曲目全是恶魔之曲。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘He could no more play the Wold Hundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,’ the tranter would say.</td>
		<td class="en">“他连《赞美诗第一百首》都拉不好，就像他吹蛇形铜管一样差劲。”流动商贩会这么说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >(The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a musical instrument particularly hard to blow.)</td>
		<td class="en">（在梅尔斯托克，蛇形铜管是一种非常难吹奏的乐器。）</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Occasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls of grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive organization.</td>
		<td class="en">有时，“大拖把”也能打动成年人的心，产生如前所述的效果，心思细腻敏感的年轻女子尤其如此。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Such an one was Car’line Aspent.</td>
		<td class="en">卡罗琳·阿斯彭特就是这样的一个女人。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Though she was already engaged to be married before she met him, Car’line, of them all, was the most influenced by Mop Ollamoor’s heart-stealing melodies, to her discomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.</td>
		<td class="en">尽管在遇到“大拖把”之前，卡罗琳已经订了婚，但是在所有这些女人中，她是受“大拖把”奥拉莫尔那勾魂的旋律影响最深的人。那旋律不仅使她不安，还给她带来极大的痛苦和致命的伤害。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >She was a pretty, invocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her sex was a tendency to peevishness now and then.</td>
		<td class="en">她漂亮，惹人怜爱，不善言辞。跟同性伴侣在一起时，她唯一的缺点是偶尔爱发发牢骚。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At this time she was not a resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off at Stickleford, farther down the river.</td>
		<td class="en">那时，她并不是“大拖把”所在的梅尔斯托克教区的居民，她住在河流下游几英里外的斯蒂克福德。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >How and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is not truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed on one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she chanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and languidly leaned over the parapet.</td>
		<td class="en">关于她是在何地如何结识他及其琴技的，实际上并不为人所知，但是据说这一切始于或源于一个春天的夜晚。当时，她经过下梅尔斯托克，恰好在他寓所附近的桥上停留歇息，无精打采地靠在栏杆上。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Mop was standing on his door-step, as was his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and demi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of passers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the little children hanging around him.</td>
		<td class="en">像往常一样，“大拖把”站在门阶上，用小提琴的E弦为过路人拉奏出让人沉醉的十六分音符和三十二分音符的乐曲。当围在他身边久久不愿离去的小孩子们泪流满面时，他便欢笑起来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Car’line pretended to be engrossed with the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was listening, as he knew.</td>
		<td class="en">卡罗琳假装被桥洞下泛着涟漪的溪水吸引，其实却在聆听他奏出的音乐，这一点他很清楚。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Presently the aching of the heart seized her simultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an infinite dance.</td>
		<td class="en">不久，伴随着心的痛楚，她产生了一种强烈的欲望，想要在无尽的舞蹈迷宫中翩然起舞。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on, although it would be necessary to pass him as he played.</td>
		<td class="en">为了摆脱这种诱惑，她决定继续向前走，尽管必须经过他的面前。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >On stealthily glancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes were closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.</td>
		<td class="en">她悄悄地瞥了一眼小提琴手，发现他闭着眼睛，沉浸在演奏中，便安下心来，大胆地大步向前走。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and more accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced along.</td>
		<td class="en">但是离他近一点儿时，她的脚步又变得羞怯起来，步伐跳动着，与旋律的节奏越来越一致，简直就是踏着舞步向前走了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw that one of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her emotional state.</td>
		<td class="en">走到他正前方时，她又瞥了他一眼，看到他的一只眼睛睁着，用探究的目光看着她，同时嘲笑她激动的情绪。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled capers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car’line was unable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.</td>
		<td class="en">直到离开那所房子很长一段距离，她的步伐才摆脱了不由自主的跳跃。好几个小时之后，卡罗琳才摆脱了那莫名的悸动。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >After that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to which she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the musician, Car’line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved a walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as elsewhere.</td>
		<td class="en">那天之后，每当附近有舞会，只要她能获得邀请，而且“大拖把”奥拉莫尔是舞会的伴奏者时，卡罗琳总是设法参加。由于他不常在斯蒂克福德演奏，卡罗琳有时要走好几英里，但她还是乐此不疲。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it would require a neurologist to fully explain them.</td>
		<td class="en">还有一些能表明他对她的影响的迹象，它们相当奇异，可能需要一位神经科医师才能完全解释清楚。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >She would be sitting quietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish clerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this being the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles eastward.</td>
		<td class="en">每天天黑后，她会静静地坐在身为教区执事的父亲的房子里。房子位于斯蒂克福德村街道中部，这条街是连接下梅尔斯托克和东边五英里外的莫尔福德的大路。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Here, without a moment’s warning, and in the midst of a general conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before alluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she would start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a galvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she would burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed that she grew calm as usual.</td>
		<td class="en">在这房子里，当父亲、姐姐以及之前提到的年轻男子——他热烈地追求她，却并不知道她的悸动——进行日常的交谈时，她会毫无预警地从壁炉边的座位上跳起来，再向天花板猛跳几下，好像触了电一般。接着她便大哭起来，持续半个小时左右才会恢复平静。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Her father, knowing her hysterical tendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his youngest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit.</td>
		<td class="en">她的父亲知道她情绪很容易变得激动，总是为最小的女儿这一特质忧心忡忡，担心那是癫痫发作的症状。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew; but his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman whom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles farther on.</td>
		<td class="en">那个行人就是“大拖把”奥拉莫尔，这一点女孩很清楚。但是，他到这里并不是来拜访她，而是去找那个他称之为意中人的另一个女人。那女人住在莫尔福德，还要再走两英里才到。</td></tr>
