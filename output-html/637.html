		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >新婚数月之后的一个夏夜，我坐在自家的壁炉跟前，一边抽睡前的最后一斗烟，一边对着一本小说频频点头，因为日间的工作十分繁忙，让人筋疲力尽。我妻子已经上了楼，早些时候我还听见了前厅大门上锁的声音，由此知道仆人们也已经回房休息。我从椅子上站起身来，正在磕烟斗上的烟灰，门铃却突然叮叮当当地响了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">One summer night a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day’s work had been an exhausting one. My wife had already gone upstairs, and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired. I had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我看了看钟，时间是十一点三刻。这时候不会有客人上门，来的显然是一个病人，兴许会让我整夜不得休息。想到这里，我愁眉苦脸地走进前厅，替来人打开了门。出乎我意料的是，站在我家门口的竟然是歇洛克·福尔摩斯。</td>
		<td class="en">I looked at the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. This could not be a visitor at so late an hour. A patient evidently, and possibly an all-night sitting. With a wry face I went out into the hall and opened the door. To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood upon my step.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“You look surprised, and no wonder! Relieved, too, I fancy! Hum! You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days, then! There’s no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat.

		<td class="en">“Ah! He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it. No, thank you, I had some supper at Waterloo, but I’ll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我把烟草袋子递给了他，他坐到我的对面，默不作声地抽了一会儿。我心里非常清楚，没有专业上的重要事务，他是不会在这样的时间来找我的，于是我耐心等待，等他自己讲明来意。</td>
		<td class="en">I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and smoked for some time in silence. I was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour, so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Holmes chuckled to himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的优势在于我了解你的习惯，亲爱的华生，”他说道。“出诊的时候，路近你就走着去，路远你就坐马车。我注意到你的靴子虽然穿过，但却一点儿也不脏，因此就可以断定，眼下你忙得够戗，不得不用马车代步。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,” said he. “When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you use a hansom. As I perceive that your boots, although used, are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“妙极了！”我赞叹了一声。</td>
		<td class="en">“Excellent!” I cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“简单之极，”他说道。“这是一个小小的例证，说明演绎专家之所以能制造出让旁人觉得不可思议的效果，仅仅是因为旁人没有留意到他用作演绎基础的那个小小细节。同样道理，我亲爱的伙计，你撰写的那些小小故事之所以能有耸人听闻的效果，实际上只是因为你把案情当中的一些要素捏在了自个儿的手心里，从来不跟读者分享。好了，我眼下的处境就跟你那些读者一模一样，因为我碰上了一件空前离奇的疑难案子，也掌握了几条线索，偏偏又缺了那么一两个要素，没法把自己的假设补充完整。不过，我会找到它们的，华生，会找到的！”说到这里，他的双眼熠熠闪光，瘦削的双颊也泛起了淡淡的红晕。有那么一瞬间，他那种机警热切的天性从面幂之下探出了头，不过，这也仅仅是一瞬间而已。等我再看他的时候，他的面孔已经恢复了印第安人那种铁板一块的模样，就因为这种模样，许多人都觉得他不像是一个有血有肉的人，更像是一部机器。</td>
		<td class="en">“Elementary,” said he. “It is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour, because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction. The same may be said, my dear fellow, for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader. Now, at present I am in the position of these same readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a man’s brain, and yet I lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory. But I’ll have them, Watson, I’ll have them!” His eyes kindled and a slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant the veil had lifted upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. When I glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这件案子呈现出了一些有趣的特征，”他说道。“依我看，说这些特征前所罕见也不为过。我已经进行了深入的调查，照我自己的估计，答案也已经近在眼前。如果你能陪我完成最后这个步骤的话，就算是帮了我一个大忙。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The problem presents features of interest,” said he. “I may even say exceptional features of interest. I have already looked into the matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution. If you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable service to me.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case. It is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter. It is the supposed murder of Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am investigating.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我一点儿也没听说过这件事情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have heard nothing of it.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“It has not excited much attention yet, except locally. The facts are only two days old. Briefly they are these:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你应该知道，皇家芒斯特步兵团是本国陆军当中最著名的爱尔兰团之一，曾在克里米亚战争和印度兵变[^4]期间立下赫赫奇功。从那以后，它在各种场合当中的表现也都是卓越不凡。到周一晚上为止，它的指挥官一直都是詹姆斯·巴克利。巴克利是一名勇敢无畏的老兵，起初不过是一名普通战士，凭借印度兵变之中的英勇表现才有了军官的身份，后来又在自己的团队里步步高升，最终就从肩扛步枪的小卒变成了整支团队的指挥官。</td>
		<td class="en">“The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish regiments in the British Army. It did wonders both in the Crimea and the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion. It was commanded up to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a musket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还是一名中士的时候，巴克利上校就成了家，他妻子闺名南希·德沃伊，妻子的父亲曾经是同一个团队里的护旗军士[^5]。可想而知，成婚之后，这对年青夫妇（当时他俩还很年青）发现自己的外部环境起了变化，社交方面也受了一些排挤。不过，他俩似乎很快就适应了这样的变化，从我了解的情况来看，巴克利太太一直都很受同团女眷的欢迎，她丈夫也很受军中袍泽的喜爱。我还得补充一点，她是个非常漂亮的女子，即便是在结婚三十多年之后的现在，她依然拥有女王一般的惊人美貌。</td>
		<td class="en">“Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of a former colour sergeant in the same corps. There was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple (for they were still young) found themselves in their new surroundings. They appear, however, to have quickly adapted themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his brother officers. I may add that she was a woman of great beauty, and that even now, when she has been married for upward of thirty years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看情形，巴克利上校的家庭生活一直都是十分美满。大部分案情我都是从墨菲少校那里了解到的，而他信誓旦旦地告诉我，他从来没听说过这对夫妻闹意见的事情。按照墨菲少校的看法，总体说来，巴克利对妻子要比妻子对他更为痴心。如果妻子不在身边，哪怕只是一天，他也会觉得十分紧张。另一方面，妻子对他虽然也称得上忠贞不渝，依恋之情却不像他那么明显。不过，全团上下都认为他俩是中年夫妇的绝佳典范。从他俩的关系当中，谁也瞧不出后来那场悲剧的任何端倪。</td>
		<td class="en">“Colonel Barclay’s family life appears to have been a uniformly happy one. Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair. On the whole, he thinks that Barclay’s devotion to his wife was greater than his wife’s to Barclay. He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day. She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively affectionate. But they were regarded in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple. There was absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for the tragedy which was to follow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从自身性格来看，巴克利上校似乎有一些古怪之处。通常情况之下，他都是一名大大咧咧、兴高采烈的老战士，隔三岔五，他也会表现出相当暴戾的性情和相当强烈的报复心。话说回来，他似乎从来不曾把天性中的这一面用到他妻子身上。除了墨菲少校之外，我还跟其他五名军官聊过，他们当中有三个都留意到了墨菲少校也曾留意的另一个事实，那就是有些时候，上校会突然陷入一种古怪的消沉状态。按照墨菲少校的形容，情形往往是他正在餐桌上跟大家耍笑逗乐，笑容却突然从他的嘴边彻底消失，就跟被一只看不见的手抹掉了似的。一旦陷入这种状态，他的情绪就会低落到无以复加的地步，一连几天都缓不过劲儿来。在他那些军中袍泽看来，他性情之中的全部古怪就是这种消沉状态，外加一点儿小小的迷信。后面这种怪癖的表现是他特别地害怕独处，天黑之后尤其如此。这种孩子气的恐惧跟他十分阳刚的性情格格不入，经常都会引起人们的议论和猜测。</td>
		<td class="en">“Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in his character. He was a dashing, jovial old soldier in his usual mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness. This side of his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his wife. Another fact which had struck Major Murphy and three out of five of the other officers with whom I conversed was the singular sort of depression which came upon him at times. As the major expressed it, the smile has often been struck from his mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he has been joining in the gaieties and chaff of the mess-table. For days on end, when the mood was on him, he has been sunk in the deepest gloom. This and a certain tinge of superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his brother officers had observed. The latter peculiarity took the form of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark. This puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often given rise to comment and conjecture.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“皇家芒斯特步兵团（前身是第一百一十七团）的第一营已经在奥尔德肖特驻扎多年，有家室的军官都住在军营外面，上校则一直住在一座名为‘拉欣’的别墅里，离北边的军营大概有半英里。屋子四面都有庭院，西面跟大路之间的距离却不超过三十码。上校夫妇没有孩子，家里只请了一名车夫和两名女仆，平常又没有客人到家里来住，这样一来，主仆五人就成了拉欣别墅仅有的住客。</td>
		<td class="en">“The first battalion of the Royal Munsters (which is the old One Hundred and Seventeenth) has been stationed at Aldershot for some years. The married officers live out of barracks, and the colonel has during all this time occupied a villa called ‘Lachine,’ about half a mile from the north camp. The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it is not more than thirty yards from the highroad. A coachman and two maids form the staff of servants. These with their master and mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of last Monday.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“情形似乎是，巴克利太太是一名天主教徒，对圣乔治救济会的事务非常热心，后者是附属于瓦特街小教堂的一个慈善机构，使命是向穷人分发旧衣服。当晚八点，救济会有个会议，为了及时赶到会场，巴克利太太便急急忙忙地吃完了晚餐。她出门之前，车夫听见她跟丈夫聊了几句家常，还说她很快就会回来，叫丈夫不要担心。接下来，她去了紧邻她家的那座别墅，叫上了一个名叫莫里森的年青小姐，两个人一起前往会场。她们的会开了四十分钟，九点过一刻的时候，巴克利太太回到了家里，路上还把莫里森小姐送了回去。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off clothing. A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be present at it. When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa and the two went off together to their meeting. It lasted forty minutes, and at a quarter past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss Morrison at her door as she passed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“拉欣别墅里有一个权充日间起居室[^6]的房间，房间朝着大路，通过一道巨大的折叠玻璃门[^7]与外面的草坪相连。草坪宽三十码，跟大路之间只隔着一堵顶上有铁栏杆的矮墙。回家之后，巴克利太太径直走进了这个房间。这个房间晚上很少有人用，百叶帘也没有拉上，即便如此，巴克利太太还是一反常态地走了进去，自己点上了提灯，跟着就拉响铃铛，让女仆简·斯图尔特端一杯茶给她。上校本来坐在餐室里，听到妻子已经回来，就跑到日间起居室去找她。车夫看见他穿过厅堂走了进去，进去就没能活着出来。</td>
		<td class="en">“There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine. This faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the lawn. The lawn is thirty yards across and is only divided from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it. It was into this room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return. The blinds were not down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the housemaid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to her usual habits. The colonel had been sitting in the dining-room, but, hearing that his wife had returned, he joined her in the morning-room. The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it. He was never seen again alive.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“十分钟之后，女仆按照太太的吩咐送茶过去。可是，走到门边的时候，她惊讶地听见了主人夫妇的声音，两个人正吵得不可开交。她敲了敲门，没有得到任何回答，于是便斗胆转了转门把，但却发现门是反锁着的。她自然是跑了回去，跟厨娘说了这件事情，两个女人就和车夫一起走回大厅，倾听里面那场依然激烈的口角。三个人一致同意，房间里当时只有两个声音，一个是巴克利，另一个就是他的妻子。巴克利把嗓门儿压得很低，说话也断断续续，三位听众完全听不出他在讲什么。另一方面，太太的口气倒是十分严厉，嗓门儿高起来的时候就可以听得清清楚楚。‘你这个懦夫！’这句话她说了一遍又一遍。‘现在怎么办呢？现在怎么办呢？把我的人生还给我。我没法再跟你一起过了！你这个懦夫！你这个懦夫！’以上这些就是仆人们听见的一些片断，尾声部分则是男主人突如其来的一声可怕叫喊、一声沉重的咣当，再加女主人的一声撕心裂肺的尖叫。仆人们确信房间里发生了某种惨剧，车夫赶紧冲到门前，使劲儿地想把门撬开，与此同时，房里的人还在一声接一声地尖叫。可是，车夫始终都没能把门撬开，女仆们又吓得失魂落魄，根本帮不上他的忙。突然之间，车夫想到了一个主意，于是就跑出大厅，绕到了那道大玻璃门前面的草坪上。他毫不费力地走进了房间，因为玻璃门开了一扇，据他们说，门开着也是夏天里的正常情形。车夫进去的时候，女主人已经停止尖叫，四仰八叉地晕倒在了一张沙发上，那位不幸的军人则双脚跷在一把椅子的扶手上，脑袋搁在离壁炉挡板一角很近的地面，一动不动地躺在了自个儿的血泊之中。</td>
		<td class="en">“The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle, but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside. Naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was still raging. They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard, those of Barclay and of his wife. Barclay’s remarks were subdued and abrupt so that none of them were audible to the listeners. The lady’s, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her voice could be plainly heard. ‘You coward!’ she repeated over and over again. ‘What can be done now? What can be done now? Give me back my life. I will never so much as breathe the same air with you again! You coward! You coward!’ Those were scraps of her conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man’s voice, with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman. Convinced that some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it, while scream after scream issued from within. He was unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him. A sudden thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open. One side of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the summertime, and he passed without difficulty into the room. His mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an armchair, and his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Naturally, the coachman’s first thought, on finding that he could do nothing for his master, was to open the door. But here an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself. The key was not in the inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. He went out again, therefore, through the window, and, having obtained the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned. The lady, against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to her room, still in a state of insensibility. The colonel’s body was then placed upon the sofa and a careful examination made of the scene of the tragedy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“检查发现，那名不幸的老兵伤在脑后，伤口参差不齐，大概有两英寸长，来由显然是某种钝器的猛然一击。钝器的具体样式也是个不难推测的问题，因为尸体旁边的地板上就躺着一根形制奇特的雕花木棒，材质是硬木，带有骨制的把柄。上校从他征战过的那些国家里搜罗了一大堆各式各样的武器，据警方推测，这根木棒也是他的战利品之一。仆人们都说以前没见过这根木棒，不过，别墅里的奇异物品数不胜数，即便大家都没注意到它，也完全可以说得过去。除此之外，警方再没有在房间里找到什么值得注意的东西。值得注意的只有一个无法解释的事实，那就是房间的钥匙不在巴克利太太身上，不在死者身上，也不在房间里的任何地方。房门最终还是打开了，开门的则是奥尔德肖特的一名锁匠。</td>
		<td class="en">“The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt weapon. Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have been. Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle. The colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that this club was among his trophies. The servants deny having seen it before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked. Nothing else of importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay’s person nor upon that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to be found.

One other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the housemaid. You will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants. On that first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hardly hear anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they had fallen out. On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she heard the word David uttered twice by the lady. The point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel.

More than one person fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect. It was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused him the utmost horror. This, of course, fitted in well enough with the police theory, if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him.

Therefore it must have been taken from it. But neither the colonel nor the colonel’s wife could have taken it. That was perfectly clear. Therefore a third person must have entered the room.

There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming from the road. I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of his footmarks: one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon the stained boards near the window where he had entered.

In spite of the warm weather he was crouching over a fire, and the little room was like an oven. The man sat all twisted and huddled in his chair in a way which gave an indescribable impression of deformity, but the face which he turned towards us, though worn and swarthy, must at some time have been remarkable for its beauty. He looked suspiciously at us now out of yellow-shot, bilious eyes, and, without speaking or rising, he waved towards two chairs.</td></tr>

It was our only chance, for we could not hope to fight our way out with all the women and children, so I volunteered to go out and to warn General Neill of our danger. My offer was accepted, and I talked it over with Sergeant Barclay, who was supposed to know the ground better than any other man, and who drew up a route by which I might get through the rebel lines.

I was tortured and tried to get away, and was captured and tortured again. You can see for yourselves the state in which I was left. Some of them that fled into Nepal took me with them, and then afterwards I was up past Darjeeling. The hill-folk up there murdered the rebels who had me, and I became their slave for a time until I escaped; but instead of going south I had to go north, until I found myself among the Afghans. There I wandered about for many a year, and at last came back to the Punjab, where I lived mostly among the natives and picked up a living by the conjuring tricks that I had learned. What use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back to England or to make myself known to my old comrades? Even my wish for revenge would not make me do that. I had rather that Nancy and my old pals should think of Harry Wood as having died with a straight back, than see him living and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee.
