		<td class="en">Many of the tales in this book were told me by one Paddy Flynn, a little bright-eyed old man, who lived in a leaky and one-roomed cabin in the village of Ballisodare1, which is, he was wont to say, “the most gentle”— whereby he meant faery—“place in the whole of County Sligo2.” Others hold it, however, but second to Drumcliff3 and Drumahair4. The first time I saw him he was cooking mushrooms for himself; the next time he was asleep under a hedge, smiling in his sleep. He was indeed always cheerful, though I thought I could see in his eyes (swift as the eyes of a rabbit, when they peered out of their wrinkled holes) a melancholy which was well-nigh a portion of their joy; the visionary melancholy of purely instinctive natures and of all animals. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其实，他生活中有太多的沮丧，年老、性格古怪和耳背使他越发孤独，顽童们又总来烦扰他。也许正因如此，他才如此钟情于欢乐与希望。比如，他喜欢讲述圣科隆巴如何安慰母亲的故事。“母亲，您今天怎么样了？”圣人问道。“更糟糕了。”母亲答道。“愿您明天更糟糕。”圣人说道。第二天，圣科隆巴又来了，两人完全重复了前一天的对话。然而第三天，母亲则说：“感谢上帝，我好些了。”圣人回答她说：“愿您明天更好些。”他也喜欢讲审判之神如何在末日微笑着，嘉赏善行，将堕落者抛入永不熄灭的烈火之中。他看到太多稀奇古怪的景象，有的让他欢喜，有的则让他忧愁。我问他是否见过精灵，他反问：“我还没被他们烦够吗？”我又问他见过报丧女妖没有，“见过，”他说，“就在水边，她用手在河中拍水呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">And yet there was much in his life to depress him, for in the triple solitude of age, eccentricity, and deafness, he went about much pestered by children. It was for this very reason perhaps that he ever recommended mirth and hopefulness. He was fond, for instance, of telling how Collumcille5 cheered up his mother. “How are you to-day, mother?” said the saint. “Worse,” replied the mother. “May you be worse to-morrow,” said the saint. The next day Collumcille came again, and exactly the same conversation took place, but the third day the mother said, “Better, thank God.” And the saint replied, “May you be better to-morrow.” He was fond too of telling how the Judge smiles at the last day alike when he rewards the good and condemns the lost to unceasing f lames. He had many strange sights to keep him cheerful or to make him sad. I asked him had he ever seen the faeries, and got the reply, “Am I not annoyed with them?” I asked too if he had ever seen the banshee6. “I have seen it,” he said, “down there by the water, batting the river with its hands.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拜访帕迪.弗林后不久，我的笔记本几乎记满了他讲的故事和他的话语，现在，我只是稍作文字上的调整，又誊抄了一遍。看着笔记，想着最后几页那将永远无缘填补的空白，心里有些懊恼。帕迪去世了。我有个朋友送他一大瓶威士忌，素有节制的他，见到这么多酒竟然兴奋不已，大醉几日之后，便再也没有醒过来。年事已高，加上生活艰辛，他的身体已不如年轻时那样能扛得住酒精的考验。弗林很会讲故事，和一般讲传奇故事的人不同，他知道如何向人们道尽天堂、地狱、炼狱、精灵王国和人间的故事。他生活的世界并不小，了解的也丝毫不逊于荷马。也许，正由于这类人的存在，盖尔人方能唤回古朴而丰富的想象。如果没有以象征和事件为载体而作的情绪表达，文学将是什么样？如果没有天堂、地狱、炼狱、精灵王国，而仅仅依赖于荒芜的人间，情感该如何表述？不但如此，如果没有勇者敢于将天堂、地狱、炼狱、精灵之地糅合，乃至将兽头安在人身，将人的灵魂置入顽石，那么情怀将如何言表？讲故事的人哪，让我们前进吧，抓住心灵向往的所有猎物，勿要惧怕。万物皆存，所言皆实，人间不过是我们脚下的些许微尘。</td>
		<td class="en">I have copied this account of Paddy Flynn, with a few verbal alterations, from a note-book which I almost filled with his tales and sayings, shortly after seeing him. I look now at the note-book regretfully, for the blank pages at the end will never be filled up. Paddy Flynn is dead; a friend of mine gave him a large bottle of whiskey, and though a sober man at most times, the sight of so much liquor filled him with a great enthusiasm, and he lived upon it for some days and then died. His body, worn out with old age and hard times, could not bear the drink as in his young days. He was a great teller of tales, and unlike our common romancers, knew how to empty heaven, hell, and purgatory, faeryland and earth, to people his stories. He did not live in a shrunken world, but knew of no less ample circumstance than did Homer himself. Perhaps the Gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination. What is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident? And are there not moods which need heaven, hell, purgatory, and faeryland for their expression, no less than this dilapidated earth? Nay, are there not moods which shall find no expression unless there be men who dare to mix heaven, hell, purgatory, and faeryland together, or even to set the heads of beasts to the bodies of men, or to thrust the souls of men into the heart of rocks? Let us go forth, the tellers of tales, and seize whatever prey the heart long for, and have no fear. Everything exists, everything is true, and the earth is only a little dust under our feet. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">There are some doubters even in the western villages. One woman told me last Christmas that she did not believe either in hell or in ghosts. Hell she thought was merely an invention got up by the priest to keep people good; and ghosts would not be permitted, she held, to go “trapsin about the earth” at their own free will; “but there are faeries,” she added, “and little leprechauns1, and water-horses and fallen angels.” I have met also a man with a mohawk2 Indian tattooed upon his arm, who held exactly similar beliefs and unbeliefs. No matter what one doubts one never doubts the faeries, for, as the man with the mohawk Indian on his arm said to me, “they stand to reason.” Even the official mind does not escape this faith. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大概三年前，在本布尔本山朝海山坡附近的格兰奇村里，有个做佣人的小女孩，一天晚上突然失踪了。附近地区顿时骚动起来，因为据传这个小女孩是被精灵们掳走的。听说，当时有个村民拼命想保住这个女孩子，但最终没能斗过它们，手中只捞到一根扫帚柄。当地治安官参与调查此事，立即下令挨家挨户进行搜查，与此同时，奉劝人们烧掉女孩失踪的那片地里的全部豚草，因为精灵们视豚草为神物。人们花了一个通宵烧掉所有的豚草，治安官也彻夜不停地念着咒语。故事还说，这个小女孩是在第二天的早晨被找到的，她当时正在田地里游荡。女孩说，精灵们带她骑着仙马走了很远，后来，她看到一条大河，那个拼命想救她的人在一只小船上，正顺流而下——精灵们的魔力总是令人异想天开。一路上，精灵们还提到了村子里几个不久将去世的人的名字。</td>
		<td class="en">A little girl who was at service in the village of Grange, close under the seaward slopes of Ben Bulben3, suddenly disappeared one night about three years ago. There was at once great excitement in the neighbourhood, because it was rumoured that the faeries had taken her. A villager was said to have long struggled to hold her from them, but at last they prevailed, and he found nothing in his hands but a broomstick4. The local constable was applied to, and he at once instituted a houseto-house search, and at the same time advised the people to burn all the bucalauns (ragweed) on the field she vanished from, because bucalauns are sacred to the faeries. They spent the whole night burning them, the constable repeating spells the while. In the morning the little girl was found, the story goes, wandering in the field. She said the faeries had taken her away a great distance, riding on a faery horse. At last she saw a big river, and the man who had tried to keep her from being carried off was drifting down it—such are the topsy-turvydoms of faery glamour— in a cockleshell. On the way her companions had mentioned the names of several people who were about to die shortly in the village. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >也许治安官是对的。宁可信其有，不可信其无。对于那些非理性的事物或者具有一点真实性的事物，最好还是持相信的态度吧，这要比为了否定而去将真理和谬误一并否定要好；因为当我们这样做时，我们没有灯芯草烛光引路，甚至没有微弱的鬼火在沼泽之地迎面起舞，我们只能在居住着形形色色鬼魂的荒芜之地摸索前行。此外，如果我们在壁炉中和灵魂里燃起长明之火，张开双臂欢迎所有前来取暖的美好生灵，无论对人或幽灵，甚至魔鬼本身，也不忍心呵斥“你走开”，我们真会因此而招致莫大的不幸吗？到头来，我们怎么会知道自己所相信的非理性的事物就不比别人所相信的真理更好呢？毕竟，这些生灵已经在我们的壁炉前与灵魂中取暖了，且随时准备迎接真理的野蜂前来筑巢，酿蜜。野蜂啊，野蜂，请再度临驾我们的世界吧！</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps the constable was right. It is better doubtless to believe much unreason and a little truth than to deny for denial’s sake truth and unreason alike, for when we do this we have not even a rush candle to guide our steps, not even a poor sowlth to dance before us on the marsh, and must needs fumble our way into the great emptiness where dwell the mis-shapen dhouls. And after all, can we come to so great evil if we keep a little fire on our hearths and in our souls, and welcome with open hand whatever of excellent come to warm itself, whether it be man or phantom, and do not say too fiercely, even to the dhouls themselves, “Be ye gone”? When all is said and done, how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than another’s truth? For it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls, and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it, and make their sweet honey. Come into the world again, wild bees, wild bees! </td></tr>

		<td class="en">One hears in the old poems of men taken away to help the gods in a battle, and Cuchullain1 won the goddess Fand2 for a while, by helping her married sister and her sister’s husband to overthrow another nation of the Land of Promise. I have been told, too, that the people of faery cannot even play at hurley unless they have on either side some mortal, whose body, or whatever has been put in its place, as the story-teller would say, is asleep at home. Without mortal help they are shadowy and cannot even strike the balls. One day I was walking over some marshy land in Galway3 with a friend when we found an old, hard-featured man digging a ditch. My friend had heard that this man had seen a wonderful sight of some kind, and at last we got the story out of him. When he was a boy he was working one day with about thirty men and women and boys. They were beyond Tuam4 and not far from Knock-na-gur. Presently they saw, all thirty of them, and at a distance of about half-a-mile, some hundred and fifty of the people of faery. There were two of them, he said, in dark clothes like people of our own time, who stood about a hundred yards from one another, but the others wore clothes of all colours, “bracket” or chequered, and some with red waistcoats. </td></tr>

He saw them for about half-an-hour, and then the old man he and those about him were working for took up a whip and said, “Get on, get on, or we will have no work done!” I asked if he saw the faeries too, “Oh, yes, but he did not want work he was paying wages for to be neglected.” He made everybody work so hard that nobody saw what happened to the faeries. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">A young man came to see me at my lodgings the other night, and began to talk of the making of the earth and the heavens and much else. I questioned him about his life and his doings. He had written many poems and painted many mystical designs since we met last, but latterly had neither written nor painted, for his whole heart was set upon making his mind strong, vigorous, and calm, and the emotional life of the artist was bad for him, he feared. He recited his poems readily, however. He had them all in his memory. Some indeed had never been written down. They, with their wild music as of winds blowing in the reeds, (I wrote this sentence long ago. This sadness now seems to me a part of all peoples who preserve the moods of the ancient peoples of the world. I am not so preoccupied with the mystery of Race as I used to be, but leave this sentence and other sentences like it unchanged. We once believed them, and have, it may be, not grown wiser.) seemed to me the very inmost voice of Celtic sadness, and of Celtic longing for infinite things the world has never seen. Suddenly it seemed to me that he was peering about him a little eagerly. “Do you see anything, X—?” I said. “A shining, winged woman, covered by her long hair, is standing near the doorway,” he answered, or some such words. “Is it the influence of some living person who thinks of us, and whose thoughts appear to us in that symbolic form?” I said; for I am well instructed in the ways of the visionaries and in the fashion of their speech. “No,” he replied; “for if it were the thoughts of a person who is alive I should feel the living influence in my living body, and my heart would beat and my breath would fail. It is a spirit. It is some one who is dead or who has never lived.” </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I asked what he was doing, and found he was clerk in a large shop. His pleasure, however, was to wander about upon the hills, talking to half mad and visionary peasants, or to persuade queer and consciencestricken persons to deliver up the keeping of their troubles into his care. Another night, when I was with him in his own lodging, more than one turned up to talk over their beliefs and disbeliefs, and sun them as it were in the subtle light of his mind. Sometimes visions come to him as he talks with them, and he is rumoured to have told divers people true matters of their past days and distant friends, and left them hushed with dread of their strange teacher, who seems scarce more than a boy, and is so much more subtle than the oldest among them. </td></tr>

Sometimes it told of other lives he believes himself to have lived in other centuries, sometimes of people he had talked to, revealing them to their own minds. I told him I would write an article upon him and it, and was told in turn that I might do so if I did not mention his name, for he wished to be always “unknown, obscure, impersonal.” Next day a bundle of his poems arrived, and with them a note in these words: “Here are copies of verses you said you liked. I do not think I could ever write or paint any more. I prepare myself for a cycle of other activities in some other life. I will make rigid my roots and branches. It is not now my turn to burst into leaves and flowers.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那些诗歌都竭力通过种种朦胧的幻象来捕捉某种强烈而飘忽的情绪。整体说来，每一篇都有精彩的段落，但往往都植入了他的思想。这些思想显然都具有他独特的价值观念；而对他人而言，这些思想却像某种无名的铸币。在这些人眼中，这些仅仅是黄铜、紫铜，顶多是褪去光泽的银子。有时，思想之美却又被粗心的书写所遮掩，似乎他突然间怀疑书写不过是一种愚蠢的苦力。他不时在诗篇中画上插图，这些并不完美的注解丝毫也掩盖不了他情感的极致之美。他所信仰的精灵们给他提供了许多题材，特别是：厄尔塞尔多恩的托马斯静坐在暮霭之中，年轻而美丽的精灵从暗处轻柔地斜探出身来，朝他低声耳语。他最喜欢色彩带来的强烈效果：精灵们头上长的并非头发，而是孔雀的羽毛；幽灵从火焰旋涡中朝星星伸手；一个精灵手捧一个斑斓如虹的水晶球——灵魂的象征——经过。然而，在这绚烂色彩的慷慨背后，始终隐藏着他对人类脆弱希望的温柔布道。他这种精神上的热望吸引了那些像他一样寻求启示或悼念已逝欢乐的人们向他靠近。其中一个人给人印象尤其深刻。一两年前的冬天，他大半个晚上都在山中来来回回游荡，与一位老农进行对话。老人对大多人都保持沉默，却向他倾吐心声。两人都郁郁寡欢：X是因为开始那会儿刚发现美术和诗歌不适合自己；老农则因为年迈无所成，希望不复存在。他们都是如此典型的凯尔特人，都奋力追逐着某些言语或行为永远无法彻底表述的某种东西。老农带着深沉的忧伤沉浸在自己的思绪中。他时而喟叹“上帝拥有天堂——上帝拥有天堂——但他还思慕着人间”，时而又哀悼自己的老邻居们都撒手人寰，所有人都已经遗忘了他：过去每走进一户人家，邻居们都为他拉上一把椅子；而现在，人们说：“那边那个老头是谁啊？”“我的末日就要到了。”他重复着，接着又说起上帝和天堂。他不止一次朝大山挥舞手臂，说：“只有我自己知道40年前那颗荆棘树下所发生的事情。”每次说这句话时，他的泪珠就在月光下闪闪发光。</td>
		<td class="en">The poems were all endeavours to capture some high, impalpable mood in a net of obscure images. There were fine passages in all, but these were often embedded in thoughts which have evidently a special value to his mind, but are to other men the counters of an unknown coinage. To them they seem merely so much brass or copper or tarnished silver at the best. At other times the beauty of the thought was obscured by careless writing as though he had suddenly doubted if writing was not a foolish labour. He had frequently illustrated his verses with drawings, in which an unperfect anatomy did not altogether hide extreme beauty of feeling. The faeries in whom he believes have given him many subjects, notably Thomas of Ercildoune1 sitting motionless in the twilight while a young and beautiful creature leans softly out of the shadow and whispers in his ear. He had delighted above all in strong effects of colour: spirits who have upon their heads instead of hair the feathers of peacocks; a phantom reaching from a swirl of flame towards a star; a spirit passing with a globe of iridescent crystal—symbol of the soul—half shut within his hand. But always under this largess of colour lay some tender homily addressed to man’s fragile hopes. This spiritual eagerness draws to him all those who, like himself, seek for illumination or else mourn for a joy that has gone. One of these especially comes to mind. A winter or two ago he spent much of the night walking up and down upon the mountain talking to an old peasant who, dumb to most men, poured out his cares for him. Both were unhappy: X— because he had then first decided that art and poetry were not for him, and the old peasant because his life was ebbing out with no achievement remaining and no hope left him. Both how Celtic! how full of striving after a something never to be completely expressed in word or deed. The peasant was wandering in his mind with prolonged sorrow. Once he burst out with “God possesses the heavens—God possesses the heavens— but He covets the world”; and once he lamented that his old neighbours were gone, and that all had forgotten him: they used to draw a chair to the fire for him in every cabin, and now they said, “Who is that old fellow there?” “The fret” [Irish for doom] “is over me,” he repeated, and then went on to talk once more of God and heaven. More than once also he said, waving his arm towards the mountain, “Only myself knows what happened under the thorn-tree forty years ago”; and as he said it the tears upon his face glistened in the moonlight. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">Probably the man braved Mrs. Stewart at Hillside Gate. When she lived she was the wife of the Protestant clergyman. “Her ghost was never known to harm any one,” say the village people; “it is only doing a penance upon the earth.” Not far from Hillside Gate, where she haunted, appeared for a short time a much more remarkable spirit. Its haunt was the bogeen, a green lane leading from the western end of the village. I quote its history at length: a typical village tragedy. In a cottage at the village end of the bogeen lived a house-painter, Jim Montgomery, and his wife. They had several children. He was a little dandy, and came of a higher class than his neighbours. His wife was a very big woman. Her husband, who had been expelled from the village choir for drink, gave her a beating one day. Her sister heard of it, and came and took down one of the window shutters—Montgomery was neat about everything, and had shutters on the outside of every window—and beat him with it, being big and strong like her sister. He threatened to prosecute her; she answered that she would break every bone in his body if he did. She never spoke to her sister again, because she had allowed herself to be beaten by so small a man. Jim Montgomery grew worse and worse: his wife soon began to have not enough to eat. She told no one, for she was very proud. Often, too, she would have no fire on a cold night. If any neighbours came in she would say she had let the fire out because she was just going to bed. The people about often heard her husband beating her, but she never told any one. She got very thin. At last one Saturday there was no food in the house for herself and the children. She could bear it no longer, and went to the priest and asked him for some money. He gave her thirty shillings. Her husband met her, and took the money, and beat her. On the following Monday she got very ill, and sent for a Mrs. Kelly. Mrs. Kelly, as soon as she saw her, said, “My woman, you are dying,” and sent for the priest and the doctor. She died in an hour. After her death, as Montgomery neglected the children, the landlord had them taken to the workhouse. A few nights after they had gone, Mrs. Kelly was going home through the bogeen when the ghost of Mrs. Montgomery appeared and followed her. It did not leave her until she reached her own house. She told the priest, Father S—, a noted antiquarian, and could not get him to believe her. A few nights afterwards Mrs. Kelly again met the spirit in the same place. She was in too great terror to go the whole way, but stopped at a neighbour’s cottage midway, and asked them to let her in. They answered they were going to bed. She cried out, “In the name of God let me in, or I will break open the door.” They opened, and so she escaped from the ghost. Next day she told the priest again. This time he believed, and said it would follow her until she spoke to it. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第三次在那条巷子遇到鬼魂，凯莉夫人问它是什么让她不能安息。鬼魂说，必须把孩子们带出救济院，因为她从没有亲戚去过那里面。此外，若要使她的灵魂安息，需要做三次弥撒。“我丈夫若不信你，”她说，“让他看这个。”说着，用三个指头碰了一下凯莉夫人的手腕，手腕被碰之处便肿胀变黑了。鬼魂随即消失了。蒙哥马利起初不相信妻子显形了。“她应该是不会让凯莉夫人看到自己的，”他说，“她只在尊贵的人面前现身。”但三个指印说服了他，孩子们也被带出了救济院。牧师做了三次弥撒，自此鬼魂再也没出现过，想必是获得安宁了吧。后来，蒙哥马利一直酗酒，家境愈加窘迫，最后死在救济院。</td>

The spirit said that its children must be taken from the workhouse, for none of its relations were ever there before, and that three masses were to be said for the repose of its soul. “If my husband does not believe you,” she said, “show him that,” and touched Mrs. Kelly’s wrist with three fingers. The places where they touched swelled up and blackened. She then vanished. For a time Montgomery would not believe that his wife had appeared: “she would not show herself to Mrs. Kelly,” he said—“she with respectable people to appear to.” He was convinced by the three marks, and the children were taken from the workhouse. The priest said the masses, and the shade must have been at rest, for it has not since appeared.

		<td class="en">I have some acquaintance among the ghost-seers of western villages. The Connaught3 tales are very different from those of Leinster. These H— spirits have a gloomy, matter-of-fact way with them. They come to announce a death, to fulfil some obligation, to revenge a wrong, to pay their bills even—as did a fisherman’s daughter the other day—and then hasten to their rest. All things they do decently and in order. It is demons, and not ghosts, that transform themselves into white cats or black dogs. The people who tell the tales are poor, serious-minded fishing people, who find in the doings of the ghosts the fascination of fear. In the western tales is a whimsical grace, a curious extravagance. The people who recount them live in the most wild and beautiful scenery, under a sky ever loaded and fantastic with flying clouds. They are farmers and labourers, who do a little fishing now and then. They do not fear the spirits too much to feel an artistic and humorous pleasure in their doings. The ghosts themselves share in their quaint hilarity. In one western town, on whose deserted wharf the grass grows, these spirits have so much vigour that, when a misbeliever ventured to sleep in a haunted house, I have been told they flung him through the window, and his bed after him. In the surrounding villages the creatures use the most strange disguises. A dead old gentleman robs the cabbages of his own garden in the shape of a large rabbit. A wicked sea-captain stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall, in the shape of a snipe, making the most horrible noises. He was only dislodged when the wall was broken down; then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I I have been lately to a little group of houses, not many enough to be called a village, in the barony of Kiltartan in County Galway, whose name, Ballylee2, is known through all the west of Ireland. There is the old square castle, Ballylee, inhabited by a farmer and his wife, and a cottage where their daughter and their son-in-law live, and a little mill with an old miller, and old ash-trees throwing green shadows upon a little river and great stepping-stones. I went there two or three times last year to talk to the miller about Biddy Early3, a wise woman that lived in Clare4 some years ago, and about her saying, “There is a cure for all evil between the two mill-wheels of Ballylee,” and to find out from him or another whether she meant the moss between the running waters or some other herb. I have been there this summer, and I shall be there again before it is autumn, because Mary Hynes, a beautiful woman whose name is still a wonder by turf fires, died there sixty years ago; for our feet would linger where beauty has lived its life of sorrow to make us understand that it is not of the world. An old man brought me a little way from the mill and the castle, and down a long, narrow boreen that was nearly lost in brambles and sloe bushes, and he said, “That is the little old foundation of the house, but the most of it is taken for building walls, and the goats have ate those bushes that are growing over it till they’ve got cranky, and they won’t grow any more. They say she was the handsomest girl in Ireland, her skin was like dribbled snow”—he meant driven snow, perhaps,—“and she had blushes in her cheeks. She had five handsome brothers, but all are gone now!” I talked to him about a poem in Irish, Raftery5, a famous poet, made about her, and how it said, “there is a strong cellar in Ballylee.” He said the strong cellar was the great hole where the river sank underground, and he brought me to a deep pool, where an otter hurried away under a grey boulder, and told me that many fish came up out of the dark water at early morning “to taste the fresh water coming down from the hills.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我最早是从一个老妇人那儿听来的这首诗。妇人家在河上游，离这里大约两英里，她记得拉夫特里和玛丽·海因斯，说：“我从没见过像她这么标致的人，今后也见不到啦。”又说，拉夫特里眼睛几乎失明，并且“没有谋生的活计，只能每天到处转，标上记号要去哪家，然后周边的邻居就会围过来听他说话。若是你对他好，他就赞美你，要不然，他就用爱尔兰语指责你。他是爱尔兰最伟大的诗人，即使碰巧站在灌木丛边，他也能写首关于灌木的歌谣来。有次他站在灌木边躲雨，就作诗赞美它，后来雨水淋下来，他又作诗指责它”。老妇人用爱尔兰语为我和朋友唱起那首献给玛丽·海因斯的诗，每一个词都清晰入耳，饱含深情，犹如旧日歌谣那样，我想那时，音乐还不像后来演变得那般壮丽，不屑于只是歌词的外袍，而是随着歌词力量的流动和嬗变婉转流畅。这首诗不及爱尔兰上个世纪最美妙的诗歌那么自然，因为其表达思想的形式过于传统。因而，这位不幸的几乎失明的老汉说起话来，就如一个富有的农夫向心爱的女人奉上自己最好的一切，但其中却不乏天真和温情的话语。同去的朋友译出诗的一部分，还有一部分是当地人自己译的。我认为，与绝大多数译作相比，这个译本更具爱尔兰歌谣的质朴特色：</td>
		<td class="en">I first heard of the poem from an old woman who lives about two miles further up the river, and who remembers Raftery and Mary Hynes. She says, “I never saw anybody so handsome as she was, and I never will till I die,” and that he was nearly blind, and had “no way of living but to go round and to mark some house to go to, and then all the neighbours would gather to hear. If you treated him well he’d praise you, but if you did not, he’d fault you in Irish. He was the greatest poet in Ireland, and he’d make a song about that bush if he chanced to stand under it. There was a bush he stood under from the rain, and he made verses praising it, and then when the water came through he made verses dispraising it.” She sang the poem to a friend and to myself in Irish, and every word was audible and expressive, as the words in a song were always, as I think, before music grew too proud to be the garment of words, f lowing and changing with the flowing and changing of their energies. The poem is not as natural as the best Irish poetry of the last century, for the thoughts are arranged in a too obviously traditional form, so the old poor half-blind man who made it has to speak as if he were a rich farmer offering the best of everything to the woman he loves, but it has naïve  and tender phrases. The friend that was with me has made some of the translation, but some of it has been made by the country people themselves. I think it has more of the simplicity of the Irish verses than one finds in most translations. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">An old weaver, whose son is supposed to go away among the Sidhe (the faeries) at night, says, “Mary Hynes was the most beautiful thing ever made. My mother used to tell me about her, for she’d be at every hurling, and wherever she was she was dressed in white. As many as eleven men asked her in marriage in one day, but she wouldn’t have any of them. There was a lot of men up beyond Kilbecanty one night, sitting together drinking, and talking of her, and one of them got up and set out to go to Ballylee and see her; but Cloon Bog was open then, and when he came to it he fell into the water, and they found him dead there in the morning. She died of the fever that was before the famine.” Another old man says he was only a child when he saw her, but he remembered that “the strongest man that was among us, one John Madden, got his death of the head of her, cold he got crossing rivers in the night-time to get to Ballylee.” This is perhaps the man the other remembered, for tradition gives the one thing many shapes. There is an old woman who remembers her, at Derrybrien8 among the Echtge9 hills, a vast desolate place, which has changed little since the old poem said, “the stag upon the cold summit of Echtge hears the cry of the wolves,” but still mindful of many poems and of the dignity of ancient speech. She says, “The sun and the moon never shone on anybody so handsome, and her skin was so white that it looked blue, and she had two little blushes on her cheeks.” And an old wrinkled woman who lives close by Ballylee, and has told me many tales of the Sidhe, says, “I often saw Mary Hynes, she was handsome indeed. She had two bunches of curls beside her cheeks, and they were the colour of silver. I saw Mary Molloy that was drowned in the river beyond, and Mary Guthrie that was in Ardrahan10, but she took the sway of them both, a very comely creature. I was at her wake too—she had seen too much of the world. She was a kind creature. One day I was coming home through that field beyond, and I was tired, and who should come out but the Poisin Glegeal (the shining flower), and she gave me a glass of new milk.” This old woman meant no more than some beautiful bright colour by the colour of silver, for though I knew an old man—he is dead now—who thought she might know “ the cure for all the evils in the world,” that the Sidhe knew, she has seen too little gold to know its colour. But a man by the shore at Kinvara11, who is too young to remember Mary Hynes, says, “Everybody says there is no one at all to be seen now so handsome; it is said she had beautiful hair, the colour of gold. She was poor, but her clothes every day were the same as Sunday, she had such neatness. And if she went to any kind of a meeting, they would all be killing one another for a sight of her, and there was a great many in love with her, but she died young. It is said that no one that has a song made about them will ever live long.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们说，过分被人赞美钦慕的人将被山脚神人掳走，他能利用人类放纵的感情达到自己的目的。因此，一个药草医生曾经对我说，父亲可能会把孩子交给精灵，丈夫可能会把妻子给它们。只有当人们眼睛看着这些被爱慕或是期待的人说“上帝保佑他们”时，他们才是安全的。唱那首歌的老妇人也认为玛丽·海因斯是被“掳走”的，她这么说：“他们都掳走了那么多不漂亮的，怎么可能放过她？人们从四面八方赶来看她，可能有些人没有说‘上帝保佑她’。”一位家住杜拉斯海边的老人也相信她是被掳走的，“有些活着的人还记得她出现在守护神祭奠节（祭奠某个圣人的节日）上，大家都说她是爱尔兰最标致的姑娘。”她年纪轻轻就死了，因为众神眷顾她，而山脚神人就是神灵。或许，那句被我们忽略字面含义的古老谚语早已暗示了她的死因。相比于现在我们当中有学识的人，这些贫穷的乡民们的信仰和感情更接近古希腊世界，那就是将美与万物之源并列。她“已经看透了这世界”，但是，无论老头还是老妇人说起她，都只会归咎于别人，并不曾怪罪她。他们的心肠未必总那么软，但提到她，就变得温柔，就如特洛伊城中老人们见到海伦从城墙边走过，他们的心都软了一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Those who are much admired are, it is held, taken by the Sidhe, who can use ungoverned feeling for their own ends, so that a father, as an old herb doctor told me once, may give his child into their hands, or a husband his wife. The admired and desired are only safe if one says “God bless them” when one’s eyes are upon them. The old woman that sang the song thinks, too, that Mary Hynes was “taken,” as the phrase is, “for they have taken many that are not handsome, and why would they not take her? And people came from all parts to look at her, and maybe there were some that did not say ‘God bless her.’” An old man who lives by the sea at Duras has as little doubt that she was taken, “for there are some living yet can remember her coming to the pattern (A “pattern,” or “patron,” is a festival in honour of a saint.) there beyond, and she was said to be the handsomest girl in Ireland.” She died young because the gods loved her, for the Sidhe are the gods, and it may be that the old saying12, which we forget to understand literally, meant her manner of death in old times. These poor countrymen and countrywomen in their beliefs, and in their emotions, are many years nearer to that old Greek world, that set beauty beside the fountain of things, than are our men of learning. She “had seen too much of the world”; but these old men and women, when they tell of her, blame another and not her, and though they can be hard, they grow gentle as the old men of Troy grew gentle when Helen passed by on the walls. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">The poet who helped her to so much fame has himself a great fame throughout the west of Ireland. Some think that Raftery was half blind, and say, “I saw Raftery, a dark man, but he had sight enough to see her,”。or the like, but some think he was wholly blind, as he may have been at the end of his life. Fable makes all things perfect in their kind, and her blind people must never look on the world and the sun. I asked a man I met one day, when I was looking for a pool na mna Sidhe where women of faery have been seen, how Raftery could have admired Mary Hynes so much if he had been altogether blind? He said, “I think Raftery was altogether blind, but those that are blind have a way of seeing things, and have the power to know more, and to feel more, and to do more, and to guess more than those that have their sight, and a certain wit and a certain wisdom is given to them.” Everybody, indeed, will tell you that he was very wise, for was he not only blind but a poet? The weaver whose words about Mary Hynes I have already given, says, “His poetry was the gift of the Almighty, for there are three things that are the gift of the Almighty—poetry and dancing and principles. That is why in the old times an ignorant man coming down from the hillside would be better behaved and have better learning than a man with education you’d meet now, for they got it from God;” and a man at Coole says, “When he put his finger to one part of his head, everything would come to him as if it was written in a book;” and an old pensioner at Kiltartan says, “He was standing under a bush one time, and he talked to it, and it answered him back in Irish. Some say it was the bush that spoke, but it must have been an enchanted voice in it, and it gave him the knowledge of all the things of the world. The bush withered up afterwards, and it is to be seen on the roadside now between this and Rahasine.” There is a poem of his about a bush, which I have never seen, and it may have come out of the cauldron of fable in this shape. </td></tr>

Doran said, “I think I know what is wrong. That man will be her brother, and that man will be her lover, and the brother is sending her to America to get her away from the lover. How she is crying! But I think I could console her myself.” Presently the lover and brother went away, and Doran began to walk up and down before her, saying, “Mild weather, Miss,” or the like. She answered him in a little while, and the three began to talk together. The emigrant ship did not arrive for some days; and the three drove about on outside cars very innocently and happily, seeing everything that was to be seen. When at last the ship came, and Doran had to break it to her that he was not going to America, she cried more after him than after the first lover. Doran whispered to Byrne as he went aboard ship, “Now, Byrne, I don’t grudge her to you, but don’t marry young.” </td></tr>

We have the dark powers much more than I thought, but not as much as the Scottish, and yet I think the imagination of the people does dwell chiefly upon the fantastic and capricious.) and come across any who have seen them even more rarely, for the imagination of the people dwells rather upon the fantastic and capricious, and fantasy and caprice would lose the freedom which is their breath of life, were they to unite them either with evil or with good. And yet the wise are of opinion that wherever man is, the dark powers who would feed his rapacities are there too, no less than the bright beings who store their honey in the cells of his heart, and the twilight beings who flit hither and thither, and that they encompass him with a passionate and melancholy multitude. They hold, too, that he who by long desire or through accident of birth possesses the power of piercing into their hidden abode can see them there, those who were once men or women full of a terrible vehemence, and those who have never lived upon the earth, moving slowly and with a subtler malice. The dark powers cling about us, it is said, day and night, like bats upon an old tree; and that we do not hear more of them is merely because the darker kinds of magic have been but little practised. I have indeed come across very few persons in Ireland who try to communicate with evil powers, and the few I have met keep their purpose and practice wholly hidden from those among whom they live. They are mainly small clerks and the like, and meet for the purpose of their art in a room hung with black hangings. They would not admit me into this room, but finding me not altogether ignorant of the arcane science, showed gladly elsewhere what they would do. “Come to us,” said their leader, a clerk in a large flour-mill, “and we will show you spirits who will talk to you face to face, and in shapes as solid and heavy as our own.” </td></tr>

Upon the table in front of him was a brass dish of burning herbs, a large bowl, a skull covered with painted symbols, two crossed daggers, and certain implements shaped like quern stones, which were used to control the elemental powers in some fashion I did not discover. I also put on a black gown, and remember that it did not fit perfectly, and that it interfered with my movements considerably. The sorcerer then took a black cock out of a basket, and cut its throat with one of the daggers, letting the blood fall into the large bowl. He opened a book and began an invocation, which was certainly not English, and had a deep guttural sound. Before he had finished, another of the sorcerers, a man of about twenty-five, came in, and having put on a black gown also, seated himself at my left band. I had the invoker directly in front of me, and soon began to find his eyes, which glittered through the small holes in his hood, affecting me in a curious way. I struggled hard against their inf luence, and my head began to ache. The invocation continued, and nothing happened for the first few minutes. Then the invoker got up and extinguished the light in the hall, so that no glimmer might come through the slit under the door. There was now no light except from the herbs on the brass dish, and no sound except from the deep guttural murmur of the invocation. </td></tr>

After a struggle I got rid of the black clouds, and was able to observe with my ordinary senses again. The two sorcerers now began to see black and white columns moving about the room, and finally a man in a monk’s habit, and they became greatly puzzled because I did not see these things also, for to them they were as solid as the table before them.

She was lonely for the priest and her society, (The religious society she had belonged to.) and hung herself to the banisters with a scarf. She was no sooner dead than she became white as a lily, and if it had been murder or suicide she would have become black as black. They gave her Christian burial, and the priest said she was no sooner dead than she was with the Lord. So nothing matters that you do for the love of God.” I do not wonder at the pleasure she has in telling this story, for she herself loves all holy things with an ardour that brings them quickly to her lips. She told me once that she never hears anything described in a sermon that she does not afterwards see with her eyes. She has described to me the gates of Purgatory as they showed themselves to her eyes, but I remember nothing of the description except that she could not see the souls in trouble but only the gates. Her mind continually dwells on what is pleasant and beautiful. One day she asked me what month and what flower were the most beautiful. When I answered that I did not know, she said, “the month of May, because of the Virgin,1 and the lily of the valley, because it never sinned, but came pure out of the rocks,” and then she asked, “what is the cause of the three cold months of winter?” I did not know even that, and so she said, “the sin of man and the vengeance of God.” Christ Himself was not only blessed, but perfect in all manly proportions in her eyes, so much do beauty and holiness go together in her thoughts.

They sing chiefly, it seems, a song called “The Distant Waterfall,” and though they once knocked her down she never thinks badly of them. She saw them most easily when she was in service in King’s County2, and one morning a little while ago she said to me, “Last night I was waiting up for the master and it was a quarter-past eleven. I heard a bang right down on the table. ‘King’s County all over,’ says I, and I laughed till I was near dead. It was a warning I was staying too long. They wanted the place to themselves.” I told her once of somebody who saw a faery and fainted, and she said, “It could not have been a faery, but some bad thing, nobody could faint at a faery. It was a demon. I was not afraid when they near put me, and the bed under me, out through the roof. I wasn’t afraid either when you were at some work and I heard a thing coming flop-flop up the stairs like an eel, and squealing. It went to all the doors. It could not get in where I was. I would have sent it through the universe like a flash of fire. There was a man in my place, a tearing fellow, and he put one of them down. He went out to meet it on the road, but he must have been told the words. But the faeries are the best neighbours. If you do good to them they will do good to you, but they don’t like you to be on their path.” Another time she said to me, “They are always good to the poor.” </td></tr>

But I could not imagine this man seeing Paradise.

Singing they do be sometimes, and dancing, but all the time they have cloven feet.” Yet he was so scornful of unchristian things for all their dancing and singing that he thinks that “you have only to bid them begone and they will go. It was one night,” he says, “after walking back from Kinvara and down by the wood beyond I felt one coming beside me, and I could feel the horse he was riding on and the way he lifted his legs, but they do not make a sound like the hoofs of a horse. So I stopped and turned around and said, very loud, ‘Be off!’ and he went and never troubled me after. And I knew a man who was dying, and one came on his bed, and he cried out to it, ‘Get out of that, you unnatural animal!’ and it left him. Fallen angels they are, and after the fall God said, ‘Let there be Hell,’ and there it was in a moment.” An old woman who was sitting by the fire joined in as he said this with “God save us, it’s a pity He said the word, and there might have been no Hell the day,” but the seer did not notice her words. He went on, “And then he asked the devil what would he take for the souls of all the people. And the devil said nothing would satisfy him but the blood of a virgin’s son, so he got that, and then the gates of Hell were opened.” He understood the story, it seems, as if it were some riddling old folk tale. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">Michael Moran1 was born about 1794 off Black Pitts, in the Liberties of Dublin, in Faddle Alley. A fortnight after birth he went stone blind from illness, and became thereby a blessing to his parents, who were soon able to send him to rhyme and beg at street corners and at the bridges over the Liffey2. They may well have wished that their quiver were full of such as he, for, free from the interruption of sight, his mind became a perfect echoing chamber, where every movement of the day and every change of public passion whispered itself into rhyme or quaint saying. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">By the time he had grown to manhood he was the admitted rector of all the ballad-mongers of the Liberties. Madden, the weaver, Kearney, the blind fiddler from Wicklow3, Martin from Meath4, M’Bride from heaven knows where, and that M’Grane, who in after days, when the true Moran was no more, strutted in borrowed plumes, or rather in borrowed rags, and gave out that there had never been any Moran but himself, and many another, did homage before him, and held him chief of all their tribe. Nor despite his blindness did he find any difficulty in getting a wife, but rather was able to pick and choose, for he was just that mixture of ragamuffin and of genius which is dear to the heart of woman, who, perhaps because she is wholly conventional herself, loves the unexpected, the crooked, the bewildering. Nor did he lack, despite his rags, many excellent things, for it is remembered that he ever loved caper sauce, going so far indeed in his honest indignation at its absence upon one occasion as to f ling a leg of mutton at his wife. He was not, however, much to look at, with his coarse frieze coat with its cape and scalloped edge, his old corduroy trousers and great brogues, and his stout stick made fast to his wrist by a thong of leather: and he would have been a woeful shock to the gleeman MacConglinne5, could that friend of kings have beheld him in prophetic vision from the pillar stone at Cork6. And yet though the short cloak and the leather wallet were no more, he was a true gleeman, being alike poet, jester, and newsman of the people. In the morning when he had finished his breakfast, his wife or some neighbour would read the newspaper to him, and read on and on until he interrupted with, “That’ll do—I have me meditations;” and from these meditations would come the day’s store of jest and rhyme. He had the whole Middle Ages under his frieze coat. </td></tr>

Boys, am I standin’ in puddle? am I standin’ in wet?” Thereon several boys would cry, “Ali, no! yez not! yer in a nice dry place. Go on with St. Mary; go on with Moses7” —each calling for his favourite tale. Then Moran, with a suspicious wriggle of his body and a clutch at his rags, would burst out with “All me buzzim friends are turned backbiters;” and after a final “If yez don’t drop your coddin’ and diversion I’ll lave some of yez a case,” by way of warning to the boys, begin his recitation, or perhaps still delay, to ask, “Is there a crowd round me now?

When at last she was at the point of death, God sent Bishop Zozimus to hear her confession, give her the last sacrament, and with the help of a lion, whom He sent also, dig her grave. The poem has the intolerable cadence of the eighteenth century, but was so popular and so often called for that Moran was soon nicknamed Zozimus, and by that name is he remembered.

		<td class="en">One night a middle-aged man, who had lived all his life far from the noise of cab-wheels, a young girl, a relation of his, who was reported to be enough of a seer to catch a glimpse of unaccountable lights moving over the fields among the cattle, and myself, were walking along a far western sandy shore. We talked of the Forgetful People as the faery people are sometimes called, and came in the midst of our talk to a notable haunt of theirs, a shallow cave amidst black rocks, with its reflection under it in the wet sea sand. I asked the young girl if she could see anything, for I had quite a number of things to ask the Forgetful People. She stood still for a few minutes, and I saw that she was passing into a kind of waking trance, in which the cold sea breeze no longer troubled her, nor the dull boom of the sea distracted her attention. I then called aloud the names of the great faeries, and in a moment or two she said that she could hear music far inside the rocks, and then a sound of confused talking, and of people stamping their feet as if to applaud some unseen performer. Up to this my other friend had been walking to and fro some yards off, but now he passed close to us, and as he did so said suddenly that we were going to be interrupted, for he heard the laughter of children somewhere beyond the rocks. We were, however, quite alone. The spirits of the place had begun to cast their inf luence over him also. In a moment he was corroborated by the girl, who said that bursts of laughter had begun to mingle with the music, the confused talking, and the noise of feet. She next saw a bright light streaming out of the cave, which seemed to have grown much deeper, and a quantity of little people, (The people and faeries in Ireland are sometimes as big as we are, sometimes bigger, and sometimes, as I have been told, about three feet high. The Old Mayo woman I so often quote, thinks that it is something in our eyes that makes them seem big or little.) in various coloured dresses, red predominating, dancing to a tune which she did not recognize.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I then bade her call out to the queen of the little people to come and talk with us. There was, however, no answer to her command. I therefore repeated the words aloud myself, and in a moment a very beautiful tall woman came out of the cave. I too had by this time fallen into a kind of trance, in which what we call the unreal had begun to take upon itself a masterful reality, and was able to see the faint gleam of golden ornaments, the shadowy blossom of dim hair. I then bade the girl tell this tall queen to marshal her followers according to their natural divisions, that we might see them. I found as before that I had to repeat the command myself. The creatures then came out of the cave, and drew themselves up, if I remember rightly, in four bands. One of these bands carried quicken boughs in their hands, and another had necklaces made apparently of serpents’ scales, but their dress I cannot remember, for I was quite absorbed in that gleaming woman. I asked her to tell the seer whether these caves were the greatest faery haunts in the neighbourhood. Her lips moved, but the answer was inaudible. I bade the seer lay her hand upon the breast of the queen, and after that she heard every word quite distinctly. No, this was not the greatest faery haunt, for there was a greater one a little further ahead. I then asked her whether it was true that she and her people carried away mortals, and if so, whether they put another soul in the place of the one they had taken? “We change the bodies,” was her answer. “Are any of you ever born into mortal life?” “Yes.” “Do I know any who were among your people before birth?” “You do.” “Who are they?” “It would not be lawful for you to know.” I then asked whether she and her people were not “dramatizations of our moods”? “She does not understand,” said my friend, “but says that her people are much like human beings, and do most of the things human beings do.” I asked her other questions, as to her nature, and her purpose in the universe, but only seemed to puzzle her. At last she appeared to lose patience, for she wrote this message for me upon the sands—the sands of vision, not the grating sands under our feet—“Be careful, and do not seek to know too much about us.” Seeing that I had offended her, I thanked her for what she had shown and told, and let her depart again into her cave. In a little while the young girl awoke out of her trance, and felt again the cold wind of the world, and began to shiver. </td></tr>

He has heard the hedgehog—“grainne oge,” he calls him— “grunting,” and is certain that he steals apples by rolling about under an apple tree until there is an apple sticking to every quill. He is certain too that the cats, of whom there are many in the woods, have a language of their own—some kind of old Irish. He says, “Cats were serpents, and they were made into cats at the time of some great change in the world. That is why they are hard to kill, and why it is dangerous to meddle with them. If you annoy a cat it might claw or bite you in a way that would put poison in you, and that would be the serpent’s tooth.” Sometimes he thinks they change into wild cats, and then a nail grows on the end of their tails; but these wild cats are not the same as the marten cats, who have been always in the woods. The foxes were once tame, as the cats are now, but they ran away and became wild. He talks of all wild creatures except squirrels—whom he hates—with what seems an affectionate interest, though at times his eyes will twinkle with pleasure as he remembers how he made hedgehogs unroll themselves when he was a boy, by putting a wisp of burning straw under them. </td></tr>

Many years ago he used to work in the garden, and once they put him to sleep in a garden-house where there was a loft full of apples, and all night he could hear people rattling plates and knives and forks over his head in the loft. Once, at any rate, be has seen an unearthly sight in the woods. He says, “One time I was out cutting timber over in Inchy, and about eight o’clock one morning when I got there I saw a girl picking nuts, with her hair hanging down over her shoulders, brown hair, and she had a good, clean face, and she was tall and nothing on her head, and her dress no way gaudy but simple, and when she felt me coming she gathered herself up and was gone as if the earth had swallowed her up.

Even when I was a boy I could never walk in a wood without feeling that at any moment I might find before me somebody or something I had long looked for without knowing what I looked for. And now I will at times explore every little nook of some poor coppice with almost anxious footsteps, so deep a hold has this imagination upon me. You too meet with a like imagination, doubtless, somewhere, wherever your ruling stars will have it, Saturn driving you to the woods, or the Moon, it may be, to the edges of the sea. I will not of a certainty believe that there is nothing in the sunset, where our forefathers imagined the dead following their shepherd the sun, or nothing but some vague presence as little moving as nothing. If beauty is not a gateway out of the net we were taken in at our birth, it will not long be beauty, and we will find it better to sit at home by the fire and fatten a lazy body or to run hither and thither in some foolish sport than to look at the finest show that light and shadow ever made among green leaves. I say to myself, when I am well out of that thicket of argument, that they are surely there, the divine people, for only we who have neither simplicity nor wisdom have denied them, and the simple of all times and the wise men of ancient times have seen them and even spoken to them. They live out their passionate lives not far off, as I think, and we shall be among them when we die if we but keep our natures simple and passionate.

		<td class="en">There are marten cats and badgers and foxes in the Enchanted Woods, but there are of a certainty mightier creatures, and the lake hides what neither net nor line can take. These creatures are of the race of the white stag that flits in and out of the tales of Arthur, and of the evil pig that slew Diarmuid1 where Ben Bulben mixes with the sea wind. They are the wizard creatures of hope and fear, they are of them that fly and of them that follow among the thickets that are about the Gates of Death. A man I know remembers that his father was one night in the wood of Inchy, “where the lads of Gort2 used to be stealing rods. He was sitting by the wall, and the dog beside him, and he heard something come running from Owbawn Weir, and he could see nothing, but the sound of its feet on the ground was like the sound of the feet of a deer. And when it passed him, the dog got between him and the wall and scratched at it there as if it was afraid, but still he could see nothing but only hear the sound of hoofs. So when it was passed he turned and came away home.” “ Another time,” the man says, “my father told me he was in a boat out on the lake with two or three men from Gort, and one of them had an eel-spear, and he thrust it into the water, and it hit something, and the man fainted and they had to carry him out of the boat to land, and when he came to himself he said that what he struck was like a calf, but whatever it was, it was not fish!” A friend of mine is convinced that these terrible creatures, so common in lakes, were set there in old times by subtle enchanters to watch over the gates of wisdom. He thinks that if we sent our spirits down into the water we would make them of one substance with strange moods of ecstasy and power, and go out it may be to the conquest of the world. We would, however, he believes, have first to outface and perhaps overthrow strange images full of a more powerful life than if they were really alive. It may be that we shall look at them without fear when we have endured the last adventure, that is death. 1902.0</td></tr>

As they were coming down again they saw a very thin, long-legged pig of the old Irish sort, and the pig began to follow them. One of them cried out as a joke that it was a fairy pig, and they all began to run to keep up the joke. The pig ran too, and presently, how nobody knew, this mock terror became real terror, and they ran as for their lives. When they got to the car they made the horse gallop as fast as possible, but the pig still followed. Then one of them put up his rifle to fire, but when he looked along the barrel he could see nothing. Presently they turned a corner and came to a village.

		<td class="en">One day I was walking over a bit of marshy ground close to Inchy Wood when I felt, all of a sudden, and only for a second, an emotion which I said to myself was the root of Christian mysticism. There had swept over me a sense of weakness, of dependence on a great personal Being somewhere far off yet near at hand. No thought of mine had prepared me for this emotion, for I had been pre-occupied with Aengus1 and Edain2, and with Mannanan3, son of the sea. That night I awoke lying upon my back and hearing a voice speaking above me and saying, “No human soul is like any other human soul, and therefore the love of God for any human soul is infinite, for no other soul can satisfy the same need in God.” A few nights after this I awoke to see the loveliest people I have ever seen. A young man and a young girl dressed in olive-green raiment, cut like old Greek raiment, were standing at my bedside. I looked at the girl and noticed that her dress was gathered about her neck into a kind of chain, or perhaps into some kind of stiff embroidery which represented ivy-leaves. But what filled me with wonder was the miraculous mildness of her face. There are no such faces now. It was beautiful, as few faces are beautiful, but it had neither, one would think, the light that is in desire or in hope or in fear or in speculation. It was peaceful like the faces of animals, or like mountain pools at evening, so peaceful that it was a little sad. I thought for a moment that she might be the beloved of Aengus, but how could that hunted, alluring, happy, immortal wretch have a face like this? Doubtless she was from among the children of the Moon, but who among them I shall never know. 1902.0</td></tr>

No mortal has ever touched it with his hand; no sheep or goat has ever browsed grass beside it.

To their trained eyes and ears the fields are covered by red-hatted riders, and the air is full of shrill voices—a sound like whistling, as an ancient Scottish seer has recorded, and wholly different from the talk of the angels, who “speak much in the throat, like the Irish,” as Lilly, the astrologer, has wisely said. If there be a new-born baby or new-wed bride in the neighbourhood, the nightcapped “doctors” will peer with more than common care, for the unearthly troop do not always return empty-handed. Sometimes a new-wed bride or a new-born baby goes with them into their mountains; the door swings to behind, and the new-born or the new-wed moves henceforth in the bloodless land of Faery; happy enough, but doomed to melt out at the last judgment like bright vapour, for the soul cannot live without sorrow.

Nothing seemed wrong with him, yet weaker and weaker he grew. Away went the wife to Dr. Opendon. She was shown into the shop parlour. A black cat was sitting straight up before the fire.

He was dressed all in black, the same as the cat, and his wife walked behind him dressed in black likewise. She gave him a guinea, and got a little bottle in return. Her husband recovered that time. Meanwhile the black doctor cured many people; but one day a rich patient died, and cat, wife, and doctor all vanished the night after. In a year the man Ormsby fell sick once more. Now he was a goodlooking man, and his wife felt sure the “gentry” were coveting him. She went and called on the “faery-doctor” at Cairnsfoot. As soon as he had heard her tale, he went behind the back door and began muttering, muttering, muttering—making spells. Her husband got well this time also. But after a while he sickened again, the fatal third time, and away went she once more to Cairnsfoot, and out went the faery-doctor behind his back door and began muttering, but soon he came in and told her it was no use—her husband would die; and sure enough the man died, and ever after when she spoke of him Mrs. Ormsby shook her head saying she knew well where he was, and it wasn’t in heaven or hell or purgatory either.

		<td class="en">John Kirwan was a great horse-racing man, and once landed in Liverpool with a fine horse, going racing somewhere in middle England. That evening, as he walked by the docks, a slip of a boy came up and asked where he was stabling his horse. In such and such a place, he answered. “Don’t put him there,” said the slip of a boy; “that stable will be burnt to-night.” He took his horse elsewhere, and sure enough the stable was burnt down. Next day the boy came and asked as reward to ride as his jockey in the coming race, and then was gone. The racetime came round. At the last moment the boy ran forward and mounted, saying, “If I strike him with the whip in my left hand I will lose, but if in my right hand bet all you are worth.” For, said Paddy Flynn, who told me the tale, “the left arm is good for nothing. I might go on making the sign of the cross with it, and all that, come Christmas, and a Banshee, or such like, would no more mind than if it was that broom.” Well, the slip of a boy struck the horse with his right hand, and John Kirwan cleared the field out. When the race was over, “What can I do for you now?” said he. “Nothing but this,” said the boy: “my mother has a cottage on your land-they stole me from the cradle. Be good to her, John Kirwan, and wherever your horses go I will watch that no ill follows them; but you will never see me more.” With that he made himself air, and vanished. </td></tr>

The cow fell into the river, and was washed away. There was a man thereabouts who went to a red-haired woman —for such are supposed to be wise in these things—and she told him to take the calf down to the edge of the river, and hide himself and watch. He did as she had told him, and as evening came on the calf began to low, and after a while the cow came along the edge of the river and commenced suckling it. Then, as he had been told, he caught the cow’s tail. Away they went at a great pace across hedges and ditches, till they came to a royalty (a name for the little circular ditches, commonly called raths or forts, that Ireland is covered with since Pagan times). Therein he saw walking or sitting all the people who had died out of his village in his time. A woman was sitting on the edge with a child on her knees, and she called out to him to mind what the red-haired woman had told him, and he remembered she had said, Bleed the cow. So he stuck his knife into the cow and drew blood. That broke the spell, and he was able to turn her homeward. “Do not forget the spancel,” said the woman with the child on her knees; “take the inside one.” There were three spancels on a bush; he took one, and the cow was driven safely home to the widow. </td></tr>

A short while ago, they say, two faeries, little creatures, one like a young man, one like a young woman, came to a farmer’s house, and spent the night sweeping the hearth and setting all tidy. The next night they came again, and while the farmer was away, brought all the furniture up-stairs into one room, and having arranged it round the walls, for the greater grandeur it seems, they began to dance. They danced on and on, and days and days went by, and all the country-side came to look at them, but still their feet never tired. The farmer did not dare to live at home the while; and after three months he made up his mind to stand it no more, and went and told them that the priest was coming. The little creatures when they heard this went back to their own country, and there their joy shall last as long as the points of the rushes are brown, the people say, and that is until God shall burn up the world with a kiss. </td></tr>

It seems that when mortals have gone amid those poor happy leaves of the Imperishable Rose of Beauty, blown hither and thither by the winds that awakened the stars, the dim kingdom has acknowledged their birthright, perhaps a little sadly, and given them of its best. Such a mortal was born long ago at a village in the south of Ireland. She lay asleep in a cradle, and her mother sat by rocking her, when a woman of the Sidhe (the faeries) came in, and said that the child was chosen to be the bride of the prince of the dim kingdom, but that as it would never do for his wife to grow old and die while he was still in the first ardour of his love, she would be gifted with a faery life. The mother was to take the glowing log out of the fire and bury it in the garden, and her child would live as long as it remained unconsumed. The mother buried the log, and the child grew up, became a beauty, and married the prince of the faeries, who came to her at nightfall. After seven hundred years the prince died, and another prince ruled in his stead and married the beautiful peasant girl in his turn; and after another seven hundred years he died also, and another prince and another husband came in his stead, and so on until she had had seven husbands. At last one day the priest of the parish called upon her, and told her that she was a scandal to the whole neighbourhood with her seven husbands and her long life. She was very sorry, she said, but she was not to blame, and then she told him about the log, and he went straight out and dug until he found it, and then they burned it, and she died, and was buried like a Christian, and everybody was pleased. Such a mortal too was Clooth-na-bare (Doubtless Clooth-na-bare should be Cailleac Bare, which would mean the old Woman Bare. Bare or Bere or Verah or Dera or Dhera was a very famous person, perhaps the mother of the Gods herself.

Perhaps Lough Ia is my mishearing, or the storyteller’s mispronunciation of Lough Leath, for there are many Lough Leaths.), who went all over the world seeking a lake deep enough to drown her faery life, of which she had grown weary, leaping from hill to lake and lake to hill, and setting up a cairn of stones wherever her feet lighted, until at last she found the deepest water in the world in little Lough Ia, on the top of the Birds’ Mountain at Sligo. </td></tr>

Images form themselves in our minds perpetually as if they were reflected in some pool. We gave ourselves up in old times to mythology, and saw the Gods everywhere. We talked to them face to face, and the stories of that communion are so many that I think they outnumber all the like stories of all the rest of Europe. Even to-day our country people speak with the dead and with some who perhaps have never died as we understand death; and even our educated people pass without great difficulty into the condition of quiet that is the condition of vision.

		<td class="en">One day I was at the house of my friend the strong farmer, who lives beyond Ben Bulben and Cope’s mountain, and met there a young lad who seemed to be disliked by the two daughters. I asked why they disliked him, and was told he was a coward. This interested me, for some whom robust children of nature take to be cowards are but men and women with a nervous system too finely made for their life and work. I looked at the lad; but no, that pink-and-white face and strong body had nothing of undue sensibility. After a little he told me his story. He had lived a wild and reckless life, until one day, two years before, he was coming home late at night, and suddenly fell himself sinking in, as it were, upon the ghostly world. For a moment he saw the face of a dead brother rise up before him, and then he turned and ran. He did not stop till he came to a cottage nearly a mile down the road. He flung himself against the door with so much of violence that he broke the thick wooden bolt and fell upon the floor. From that day he gave up his wild life, but was a hopeless coward. Nothing could ever bring him to look, either by day or night, upon the spot where he had seen the face, and he often went two miles round to avoid it; nor could, he said, “the prettiest girl in the country” persuade him to see her home after a party if he were alone. He feared everything, for he had looked at the face no man can see unchanged—the imponderable face of a spirit. </td></tr>

A few days after he learned this story: A great quantity of treasure had been buried in the rath in pagan times, and a number of evil faeries set to guard it; but some day it was to be found and belong to the family of the O’Byrnes. Before that day three O’Byrnes must find it and die. Two had already done so. The first had dug and dug until at last he had got a glimpse of the stone coffin that contained it, but immediately a thing like a huge hairy dog came down the mountain and tore him to pieces. The next morning the treasure had again vanished deep into the earth. The second O’Byrne came and dug and dug until he found the coffer, and lifted the lid and saw the gold shining within. He saw some horrible sight the next moment, and went raving mad and soon died. The treasure again sank out of sight. The third O’Byrne is now digging. He believes that he will die in some terrible way the moment he finds the treasure, but that the spell will be broken, and the O’Byrne family made rich for ever, as they were of old.</td></tr>

When we came to Mullingar4 the canal ended, and I began to walk, and stiff and fatigued I was after the slowness. I had some friends with me, and now and then we walked, now and then we rode in a cart. So on till we saw some girls milking cows, and stopped to joke with them. After a while we asked them for a drink of milk. ‘We have nothing to put it in here,’ they said, ‘but come to the house with us.’ We went home with them, and sat round the fire talking. After a while the others went, and left me, loath to stir from the good fire. I asked the girls for something to eat. There was a pot on the fire, and they took the meat out and put it on a plate, and told me to eat only the meat that came off the head. When I had eaten, the girls went out, and I did not see them again. It grew darker and darker, and there I still sat, loath as ever to leave the good fire, and after a while two men came in, carrying between them a corpse. When I saw them coming I hid behind the door. Says one to the other, putting the corpse on the spit, ‘Who’ll turn the spit?’ Says the other, ‘Michael H—, come out of that and turn the meat.’ I came out all of a tremble, and began turning the spit. ‘Michael H—,’ says the one who spoke first, ‘if you let it burn we’ll have to put you on the spit instead;’ and on that they went out. I sat there trembling and turning the corpse till towards midnight. The men came again, and the one said it was burnt, and the other said it was done right. But having fallen out over it, they both said they would do me no harm that time; and, sitting by the fire, one of them cried out: ‘Michael H—, can you tell me a story?’ ‘Divil a one,’ said I. On which he caught me by the shoulder, and put me out like a shot. It was a wild blowing night. Never in all my born days did I see such a night—the darkest night that ever came out of the heavens. I did not know where I was for the life of me. So when one of the men came after me and touched me on the shoulder, with a ‘Michael H—, can you tell a story now?’ ‘I can,’ says I. In he brought me; and putting me by the fire, says: ‘Begin.’ ‘I have no story but the one,’ says I, ‘that I was sitting here, and you two men brought in a corpse and put it on the spit, and set me turning it.’ ‘That will do,’ says he; ‘ye may go in there and lie down on the bed.’ And I went, nothing loath; and in the morning where was I but in the middle of a green field!” </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I Once a number of Icelandic peasantry found a very thick skull in the cemetery where the poet Egil1 was buried. Its great thickness made them feel certain it was the skull of a great man, doubtless of Egil himself. To be doubly sure they put it on a wall and hit it hard blows with a hammer. It got white where the blows fell but did not break, and they were convinced that it was in truth the skull of the poet, and worthy of every honour. In Ireland we have much kinship with the Icelanders, or “Danes” as we call them and all other dwellers in the Scandinavian countries1. In some of our mountainous and barren places, and in our seaboard villages, we still test each other in much the same way the Icelanders tested the head of Egil. We may have acquired the custom from those ancient Danish pirates, whose descendants the people of Rosses tell me still remember every field and hillock in Ireland which once belonged to their forebears, and are able to describe Rosses itself as well as any native. There is one seaboard district known as Roughley, where the men are never known to shave or trim their wild red beards, and where there is a fight ever on foot. I have seen them at a boat-race fall foul of each other, and after much loud Gaelic, strike each other with oars. The first boat had gone aground, and by dint of hitting out with the long oars kept the second boat from passing, only to give the victory to the third. One day the Sligo people say a man from Roughley was tried in Sligo for breaking a skull in a row, and made the defence not unknown in Ireland, that some heads are so thin you cannot be responsible for them. Having turned with a look of passionate contempt towards the solicitor who was prosecuting, and cried, “that little fellow’s skull if ye were to hit it would go like an egg-shell,” he beamed upon the judge, and said in a wheedling voice, “but a man might wallop away at your lordship’s for a fortnight.” </td></tr>

		<td class="en">In Ireland this world and the world we go to after death are not far apart. I have heard of a ghost that was many years in a tree and many years in the archway of a bridge, and my old Mayo woman says, “There is a bush up at my own place, and the people do be saying that there are two souls doing their penance under it. When the wind blows one way the one has shelter, and when it blows from the north the other has the shelter. It is twisted over with the way they be rooting under it for shelter. I don’t believe it, but there is many a one would not pass by it at night.” Indeed there are times when the worlds are so near together that it seems as if our earthly chattels were no more than the shadows of things beyond. A lady I knew once saw a village child running about with a long trailing petticoat upon her, and asked the creature why she did not have it cut short. “It was my grandmother’s,” said the child; “would you have her going about yonder with her petticoat up to her knees, and she dead but four days?” I have read a story of a woman whose ghost haunted her people because they had made her grave-clothes so short that the fires of purgatory burned her knees. The peasantry expect to have beyond the grave houses much like their earthly homes, only there the thatch will never grow leaky, nor the white walls lose their lustre, nor shall the dairy be at any time empty of good milk and butter. But now and then a landlord or an agent or a gauger will go by begging his bread, to show how God divides the righteous from the unrighteous. 1892 and 1902. </td></tr>

Whether they be faint or vivid, they are ever beyond the power of my will to alter in any way. They have their own will, and sweep hither and thither, and change according to its commands. One day I saw faintly an immense pit of blackness, round which went a circular parapet, and on this parapet sat innumerable apes eating precious stones out of the palms of their hands. The stones glittered green and crimson, and the apes devoured them with an insatiable hunger. I knew that I saw the Celtic Hell, and my own Hell, the Hell of the artist, and that all who sought after beautiful and wonderful things with too avid a thirst, lost peace and form and became shapeless and common.

We belonged then to God and to His works, and to things come down from the ancient days. We would not have been greatly surprised had we met the shining feet of an angel among the white mushrooms upon the mountains, for we knew in those days immense despair, unfathomed love—every eternal mood,—but now the draw-net is about our feet. A few miles eastward of Lough Gill1, a young Protestant girl, who was both pretty herself and prettily dressed in blue and white, wandered up among those mountain mushrooms, and I have a letter of hers telling how she met a troop of children, and became a portion of their dream. When they first saw her they threw themselves face down in a bed of rushes, as if in a great fear; but after a little other children came about them, and they got up and followed her almost bravely. She noticed their fear, and presently stood still and held out her arms. A little girl threw herself into them with the cry, “Ah, you are the Virgin out o’ the picture!” “No,” said another, coming near also, “she is a sky faery, for she has the colour of the sky.” “No,” said a third, “she is the faery out of the foxglove grown big.” The other children, however, would have it that she was indeed the Virgin, for she wore the Virgin’s colours. Her good Protestant heart was greatly troubled, and she got the children to sit down about her, and tried to explain who she was, but they would have none of her explanation. Finding explanation of no avail, she asked had they ever heard of Christ?</td></tr>

When the children had gone she went on her way, and had walked about half-amile, when the child who was called “a divil” jumped down from the high ditch by the lane, and said she would believe her “an ordinary lady” if she had “two skirts,” for “ladies always had two skirts.” The “two skirts” were shown, and the child went away crestfallen, but a few minutes later jumped down again from the ditch, and cried angrily, “Dad’s a divil, mum’s a divil, and I’m a divil, and you are only an ordinary lady,” and having flung a handful of mud and pebbles ran away sobbing. When my pretty Protestant had come to her own home she found that she had dropped the tassels of her parasol.

No, you are not! No, you are not!” was the passionate reply. And after all, it was not my pretty Protestant, but Mary, Star of the Sea, still walking in sadness and in beauty upon many a mountain and by many a shore, who cast those tassels at the feet of the child. It is indeed fitting that men pray to her who is the mother of peace, the mother of dreams, and the mother of purity, to leave them yet a little hour to do good and evil in, and to watch old Time telling the rosary of the stars. </td></tr>

I seemed to hear a voice of lamentation out of the Golden Age. It told me that we are imperfect, incomplete, and no more like a beautiful woven web, but like a bundle of cords knotted together and f lung into a corner. It said that the world was once all perfect and kindly, and that still the kindly and perfect world existed, but buried like a mass of roses under many spadefuls of earth. The faeries and the more innocent of the spirits dwelt within it, and lamented over our fallen world in the lamentation of the wind-tossed reeds, in the song of the birds, in the moan of the waves, and in the sweet cry of the fiddle. It said that with us the beautiful are not clever and the clever are not beautiful, and that the best of our moments are marred by a little vulgarity, or by a pin-prick out of sad recollection, and that the fiddle must ever lament about it all. It said that if only they who live in the Golden Age could die we might be happy, for the sad voices would be still; but alas! alas!

		<td class="en">Not only in Ireland is faery belief still extant. It was only the other day I heard of a Scottish farmer who believed that the lake in front of his house was haunted by a water-horse. He was afraid of it, and dragged the lake with nets, and then tried to pump it empty. It would have been a bad thing for the water-horse had he found him. An Irish peasant would have long since come to terms with the creature. For in Ireland there is something of timid affection between men and spirits. They only illtreat each other in reason. Each admits the other side to have feelings. There are points beyond which neither will go. No Irish peasant would treat a captured faery as did the man Campbell tells of. He caught a kelpie, and tied her behind him on his horse. She was fierce, but he kept her quiet by driving an awl and a needle into her. They came to a river, and she grew very restless, fearing to cross the water. Again he drove the awl and needle into her. She cried out, “Pierce me with the awl, but keep that slender, hair-like slave (the needle) out of me.” They came to an inn. He turned the light of a lantern on her; immediately she dropped down like a falling star, and changed into a lump of jelly. She was dead. Nor would they treat the faeries as one is treated in an old Highland1 poem. A faery loved a little child who used to cut turf at the side of a faery hill. Every day the faery put out his hand from the hill with an enchanted knife. The child used to cut the turf with the knife. It did not take long, the knife being charmed. Her brothers wondered why she was done so quickly. At last they resolved to watch, and find out who helped her. They saw the small hand come out of the earth, and the little child take from it the knife. When the turf was all cut, they saw her make three taps on the ground with the handle.

In Scotland it is altogether different. You have soured the naturally excellent disposition of ghosts and goblins.

He must have gone nearly a mile, when they heard the sound of a struggle. Then the piping ceased suddenly. Some time went by, and then his dog came out of the cavern completely flayed, too weak even to howl. Nothing else ever came out of the cavern. Then there is the tale of the man who dived into a lake where treasure was thought to be. He saw a great coffer of iron. Close to the coffer lay a monster, who warned him to return whence he came. He rose to the surface; but the bystanders, when they heard he had seen the treasure, persuaded him to dive again. He dived. In a little while his heart and liver floated up, reddening the water.

		<td class="en">When there was a rumour of war with France a while ago, I met a poor Sligo woman, a soldier’s widow, that I know, and I read her a sentence out of a letter I had just had from London: “The people here are mad for war, but France seems inclined to take things peacefully,” or some like sentence. Her mind ran a good deal on war, which she imagined partly from what she had heard from soldiers, and partly from tradition of the rebellion of ’981, but the word London doubled her interest, for she knew there were a great many people in London, and she herself had once lived in “a congested district.” “There are too many over one another in London. They are getting tired of the world. It is killed they want to be. It will be no matter; but sure the French want nothing but peace and quietness. The people here don’t mind the war coming. They could not be worse than they are. They may as well die soldierly before God. Sure they will get quarters in heaven.” Then she began to say that it would be a hard thing to see children tossed about on bayonets, and I knew her mind was running on traditions of the great rebellion. She said presently, “I never knew a man that was in a battle that liked to speak of it after. They’d sooner be throwing hay down from a hayrick.” She told me how she and her neighbours used to be sitting over the fire when she was a girl, talking of the war that was coming, and now she was afraid it was coming again, for she had dreamed that all the bay was “stranded and covered with seaweed.” I asked her if it was in the Fenian times2 that she had been so much afraid of war coming. But she cried out, “Never had I such fun and pleasure as in the Fenian times. I was in a house where some of the officers used to be staying, and in the daytime I would be walking after the soldiers’ band, and at night I’d be going down to the end of the garden watching a soldier, with his red coat on him, drilling the Fenians in the field behind the house. One night the boys tied the liver of an old horse, that had been dead three weeks, to the knocker, and I found it when I opened the door in the morning.” And presently our talk of war shifted, as it had a way of doing, to the battle of the Black Pig, which seems to her a battle between Ireland and England, but to me an Armageddon3 which shall quench all things in the Ancestral Darkness again, and from this to sayings about war and vengeance. “Do you know,” she said, “what the curse of the Four Fathers is? They put the man-child on the spear, and somebody said to them, ‘You will be cursed in the fourth generation after you,’ and that is why disease or anything always comes in the fourth generation.”1902.0</td></tr>

		<td class="en"> I have heard one Hearne, a witch-doctor, who is on the border of Clare and Galway, say that in “every household” of faery “there is a queen and a fool,” and that if you are “touched” by either you never recover, though you may from the touch of any other in faery. He said of the fool that he was “maybe the wisest of all,” and spoke of him as dressed like one of “the mummers that used to be going about the country.” Since then a friend has gathered me some few stories of him, and I have heard that he is known, too, in the highlands. I remember seeing a long, lank, ragged man sitting by the hearth in the cottage of an old miller not far from where I am now writing, and being told that he was a fool; and I find from the stories that my friend has gathered that he is believed to go to faery in his sleep; but whether he becomes an Amadán-na-Breena, a fool of the forth, and is attached to a household there, I cannot tell. It was an old woman that I know well, and who has been in faery herself, that spoke of him. She said, “There are fools amongst them, and the fools we see, like that Amadán of Ballylee, go away with them at night, and so do the woman fools that we call Oinseachs (apes).” A woman who is related to the witchdoctor on the border of Clare, and who can cure people and cattle by spells, said, “There are some cures I can’t do. I can’t help any one that has got a stroke from the queen or the fool of the forth. I knew of a woman that saw the queen one time, and she looked like any Christian. I never heard of any that saw the fool but one woman that was walking near Gort, and she called out, ‘There’s the fool of the forth coming after me.’ So her friends that were with her called out, though they could see nothing, and I suppose he went away at that, for she got no harm. He was like a big strong man, she said, and half naked, and that is all she said about him. I have never seen any myself, but I am a cousin of Hearne, and my uncle was away twenty-one years.” The wife of the old miller said, “It is said they are mostly good neighbours, but the stroke of the fool is what there is no cure for; any one that gets that is gone. The Amadán-na-Breena we call him!” And an old woman who lives in the Bog of Kiltartan, and is very poor, said, “It is true enough, there is no cure for the stroke of the Amadán-na-Breena. There was an old man I knew long ago, he had a tape, and he could tell what diseases you had with measuring you; and he knew many things. And he said to me one time, ‘What month of the year is the worst?’ and I said, ‘The month of May, of course.’ ‘It is not,’ he said; ‘but the month of June, for that’s the month that the Amadán gives his stroke!’ They say he looks like any other man, but he’s leathan (wide), and not smart. I knew a boy one time got a great fright, for a lamb looked over the wall at him with a beard on it, and he knew it was the Amadán, for it was the month of June. And they brought him to that man I was telling about, that had the tape, and when he saw him he said, ‘Send for the priest, and get a Mass said over him.’ And so they did, and what would you say but he’s living yet and has a family! A certain Regan said, ‘They, the other sort of people, might be passing you close here and they might touch you. But any that gets the touch of the Amadán-na-Breena is done for.’ It’s true enough that it’s in the month of June he’s most likely to give the touch. I knew one that got it, and he told me about it himself. He was a boy I knew well, and he told me that one night a gentleman came to him, that had been his land-lord, and that was dead. And he told him to come along with him, for he wanted him to fight another man. And when he went he found two great troops of them, and the other troop had a living man with them too, and he was put to fight him. And they had a great fight, and he got the better of the other man, and then the troop on his side gave a great shout, and he was left home again. But about three years after that he was cutting bushes in a wood and he saw the Amadán coming at him. He had a big vessel in his arms, and it was shining, so that the boy could see nothing else; but he put it behind his back then and came running, and the boy said he looked wild and wide, like the side of the hill. And the boy ran, and he threw the vessel after him, and it broke with a great noise, and whatever came out of it, his head was gone there and then. He lived for a while after, and used to tell us many things, but his wits were gone. He thought they mightn’t have liked him to beat the other man, and he used to be afraid something would come on him.” And an old woman in a Galway workhouse, who had some little knowledge of Queen Maive, said the other day, “The Amadán-na-Breena changes his shape every two days. Sometimes he comes like a youngster, and then he’ll come like the worst of beasts, trying to give the touch he used to be. I heard it said of late he was shot, but I think myself it would be hard to shoot him.” </td></tr>

		<td class="en">What else can death be but the beginning of wisdom and power and beauty? and foolishness may be a kind of death. I cannot think it wonderful that many should see a fool with a shining vessel of some enchantment or wisdom or dream too powerful for mortal brains in “every household of them.” It is natural, too, that there should be a queen to every household of them, and that one should hear little of their kings, for women come more easily than men to that wisdom which ancient peoples, and all wild peoples even now, think the only wisdom. The self, which is the foundation of our knowledge, is broken in pieces by foolishness, and is forgotten in the sudden emotions of women, and therefore fools may get, and women do get of a certainty, glimpses of much that sanctity finds at the end of its painful journey. The man who saw the white fool said of a certain woman, not a peasant woman, “If I had her power of vision I would know all the wisdom of the gods, and her visions do not interest her.” And I know of another woman, also not a peasant woman, who would pass in sleep into countries of an unearthly beauty, and who never cared for anything but to be busy about her house and her children; and presently an herb doctor cured her, as he called it. Wisdom and beauty and power may sometimes, as I think, come to those who die every day they live, though their dying may not be like the dying Shakespeare spoke of. There is a war between the living and the dead, and the Irish stories keep harping upon it. They will have it that when the potatoes or the wheat or any other of the fruits of the earth decay, they ripen in faery, and that our dreams lose their wisdom when the sap rises in the trees, and that our dreams can make the trees wither, and that one hears the bleating of the lambs of faery in November, and that blind eyes can see more than other eyes.

He had asked a friend of his what he should do, and the friend had told him to buy a flute, and play on it when they began to shout or to play on their pipes, and maybe they would give up annoying him; and he did, and they always went out into the field when he began to play. He showed me the pipe, and blew through it, and made a noise, but he did not know how to play; and then he showed me where he had pulled his chimney down, because one of them used to sit up on it and play on the pipes. A friend of his and mine went to see him a little time ago, for she heard that “three of them” had told him he was to die. He said they had gone away after warning him, and that the children (children they had “taken,” I suppose) who used to come with them, and play about the house with them, had “gone to some other place,” because “they found the house too cold for them, maybe”; and he died a week after he had said these things. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有位朋友从乌尔斯特给我寄来一份资料，讲述了一个人和精灵之间真正的友谊。故事记录得很精确，因为我听到故事前不久，朋友已经从老妇人那儿听过一遍了，并让她重述了一遍，当即记录下来了。朋友首先告诉老妇人，她害怕鬼魂和精灵，因些不喜欢单独呆在屋里。老妇人说：“小姐，精灵一点都不可怕。我自己就和一个精灵，或者精灵之类的女人说过很多次话呢，她和人类没有一点差别。在我小时候，她老去你外祖父家——其实是你母亲的外祖父家。你应该听说过她的事情吧。”朋友承认以前听过有关她的事，但那是很久以前的事了，想再听听。于是，老妇人接着说：“好哩，亲爱的孩子。我最早听人说起她，是你舅舅——其实，他是你母亲的舅舅——约瑟夫结婚的时候，为妻子盖了幢新房，因为他最初是把妻子带到了他父亲在湖边的家中。我父亲和我们家住得离建新房的地方不远，往下看就能看见男人们在干活。我父亲是个织布工，他把织布机之类的都放在旁边的小屋子里。地基已经标出来了，建房的石块堆在旁边，但泥瓦匠还没来。有一天，我和母亲站在地基对面，突然看见一个漂亮的娇小女人从河那边的田野里朝我们走来。我那时还是个小不点，到处蹦蹦跳跳地玩耍，但我对她印象很深，就好像她还在那儿似的！”朋友问她这个女人的穿着打扮，老妇人回忆道：“她披着灰色斗篷，穿着绿色羊绒裙，头上围条黑色丝巾，就像那时乡村妇女的打扮。”我朋友又问：“她个子有多小？”老妇人答道：“嗯，想起来她其实一点都不小，只不过我们都叫她小女人。她比很多人都高大，但也算不上高个子。看起来她是个三十岁左右的女人，头发是褐色的，脸圆圆的，和贝蒂小姐有些像。贝蒂是你外祖母的妹妹，但她和其他姊妹都不像，既不像你外祖母，也不像其他任何姐妹。贝蒂的脸圆圆的，气色红润，她一辈子都没嫁人，因为她瞧不上任何男人。我们过去总说，你看小女人，那么像贝蒂，可能是她的姐妹呢，只不过还没长大就被掳走了，所以她总是跟随着我们，给我们一些警告和预言。这一次，小女人径直向我母亲站着的地方走过来。‘现在就去湖边！’——就那样命令我母亲——‘去湖边，告诉约瑟夫，他必须把这个房子的地基迁到我给你指的那个荆丛对面。他要想兴旺发达，房子就得建在那里。现在就按我刚才说的去做！’我猜，那是因为房子正建在“精灵路”上，那是精灵们出行时走的路。母亲把约瑟芬带来，给他指明地方。于是，他照吩咐迁了地基，但没完全建在指定地方。结果呢，搬到新家后，他妻子在意外中丧了命。当时，有一匹马，拉着耙子，在灌木丛和屋墙之间想向右转，但地方不够，撞到了约瑟夫的妻子。小女人再来时，表情古怪并且很生气，对我们说：‘他没有照我说的做，他就等着瞧吧。’”朋友问起小女人这次从哪里来，穿着是否和上次一样，妇人说：“总是老样子，从河那边的田地里过来。夏天披条薄围巾，冬天披着斗篷。她来过很多回，总是给我母亲提些好建议，警告她如果想走运，就一定不要做哪些事。我们家的孩子，除了我谁都没见过她。不过每次我看到她从河边过来，都很高兴，跑出去拉着她的手，拽着她的斗篷，喊我母亲：‘小女人来了！’从来没有男人见过她。我父亲曾经总想见见她，并且对我和母亲很恼火，以为我们在撒谎说胡话。于是，有一天她来了之后，坐在炉边和母亲说话时，我就溜到父亲干活的田里。‘快来，’我说，‘你不是想见她吗，她正坐在炉边和母亲说话呢。’于是父亲跟我回到家，四处看了看，一副生气的样子，因为他什么也没见到。他抓起手边的扫帚，打了我一顿。‘你欠揍！’他说，‘竟然敢耍我！’说完，他立刻就走了，对我既怀疑又愤怒。小女人之后对我说：‘这是对你带别人来看我的惩罚。从没有男人见过我，以后也不会有。’”</td>
		<td class="en">A friend has sent me from Ulster an account of one who was on terms of true friendship with the people of faery. It has been taken down accurately, for my friend, who had heard the old woman’s story some time before I heard of it, got her to tell it over again, and wrote it out at once. She began by telling the old woman that she did not like being in the house alone because of the ghosts and fairies; and the old woman said, “There’s nothing to be frightened about in faeries, miss. Many’s the time I talked to a woman myself that was a faery, or something of the sort, and no less and more than mortal anyhow. She used to come about your grandfather’s house—your mother’s grandfather, that is—in my young days. But you’ll have heard all about her.” My friend said that she had heard about her, but a long time before, and she wanted to hear about her again; and the old woman went on, “Well, dear, the very first time ever I heard word of her coming about was when your uncle—that is, your mother’s uncle—Joseph married, and building a house for his wife, for he brought her first to his father’s, up at the house by the Lough. My father and us were living nigh hand to where the new house was to be built, to overlook the men at their work. My father was a weaver, and brought his looms and all there into a cottage that was close by. The foundations were marked out, and the building stones lying about, but the masons had not come yet; and one day I was standing with my mother fornent the house, when we sees a smart wee woman coming up the field over the burn to us. I was a bit of a girl at the time, playing about and sporting myself, but I mind her as well as if I saw her there now!” My friend asked how the woman was dressed, and the old woman said, “It was a gray cloak she had on, with a green cashmere skirt and a black silk handkercher tied round her head, like the country women did use to wear in them times.” My friend asked, “How wee was she?” And the old woman said, “Well now, she wasn’t wee at all when I think of it, for all we called her the Wee Woman. She was bigger than many a one, and yet not tall as you would say. She was like a woman about thirty, brown-haired and round in the face. She was like Miss Betty, your grandmother’s sister, and Betty was like none of the rest, not like your grandmother, nor any of them. She was round and fresh in the face, and she never was married, and she never would take any man; and we used to say that the Wee Woman—her being like Betty—was, maybe, one of their own people that had been took off before she grew to her full height, and for that she was always following us and warning and foretelling. This time she walks straight over to where my mother was standing. ‘Go over to the Lough this minute!’—ordering her like that—‘Go over to the Lough, and tell Joseph that he must change the foundation of this house to where I’ll show you fornent the thornbush. That is where it is to be built, if he is to have luck and prosperity, so do what I’m telling ye this minute.’ The house was being built on ‘the path’ I suppose—the path used by the people of faery in their journeys, and my mother brings Joseph down and shows him, and he changes the foundations, the way he was bid, but didn’t bring it exactly to where was pointed, and the end of that was, when he come to the house, his own wife lost her life with an accident that come to a horse that hadn’t room to turn right with a harrow between the bush and the wall. The Wee Woman was queer and angry when next she come, and says to us, ‘He didn’t do as I bid him, but he’ll see what he’ll see.’ ” My friend asked where the woman came from this time, and if she was dressed as before, and the woman said, “Always the same way, up the field beyant the burn. It was a thin sort of shawl she had about her in summer, and a cloak about her in winter; and many and many a time she came, and always it was good advice she was giving to my mother, and warning her what not to do if she would have good luck. There was none of the other children of us ever seen her unless me; but I used to be glad when I seen her coming up the burn, and would run out and catch her by the hand and the cloak, and call to my mother, ‘Here’s the Wee Woman!’ No man body ever seen her. My father used to be wanting to, and was angry with my mother and me, thinking we were telling lies and talking foolish like. And so one day when she had come, and was sitting by the fireside talking to my mother, I slips out to the field where he was digging. ‘Come up,’ says I, ‘if ye want to see her. She’s sitting at the fireside now, talking to mother.’ So in he comes with me and looks round angry like and sees nothing, and he up with a broom that was near hand and hits me a crig with it. ‘Take that now!’ says he, ‘for making a fool of me!’ and away with him as fast as he could, and queer and angry with me. The Wee Woman says to me then, ‘Ye got that now for bringing people to see me. No man body ever seen me, and none ever will.’ </td></tr>

Coming home from Gortin, my father got as bad a fright as ever he got in his life. What it was I don’t right mind, but anyway he was badly damaged by it. My mother was in a queer way, frightened of the Wee Woman, after what she done, and sure enough the next time she was angry. ‘Ye didn’t believe me,’ she said, ‘and ye threw the herb I gave ye in the fire, and I went far enough for it.’ There was another time she came and told how William Hearne was dead in America. ‘Go over,’ she says, ‘to the Lough, and say that William is dead, and he died happy, and this was the last Bible chapter ever he read,’ and with that she gave the verse and chapter. ‘Go,’ she says, ‘and tell them to read them at the next class meeting, and that I held his head while he died.’ And sure enough word came after that how William had died on the day she named. And, doing as she bid about the chapter and hymn, they never had such a prayer-meeting as that. One day she and me and my mother was standing talking, and she was warning her about something, when she says of a sudden, ‘Here comes Miss Letty in all her finery, and it’s time for me to be off.’ And with that she gave a swirl round on her feet, and raises up in the air, and round and round she goes, and up and up, as if it was a winding stairs she went up, only far swifter. She went up and up, till she was no bigger than a bird up against the clouds, singing and singing the whole time the loveliest music I ever heard in my life from that day to this. It wasn’t a hymn she was singing, but poetry, lovely poetry, and me and my mother stands gaping up, and all of a tremble. ‘What is she at all, mother?’ says I. ‘Is it an angel she is, or a faery woman, or what?’ With that up come Miss Letty, that was your grandmother, dear, but Miss Letty she was then, and no word of her being anything else, and she wondered to see us gaping up that way, till me and my mother told her of it. She went on gay-dressed then, and was lovely looking.

So Jack looked about for some place where there would be better grass, and after a while he saw a field with good green grass in it, and it belonging to a giant. So he knocked down a bit of the wall and drove them in, and he went up himself into an apple-tree and began to eat the apples. Then the giant came into the field. “Fee-fawfum,” says he, “I smell the blood of an Irishman. I see you where you are, up in the tree,” he said; “you are too big for one mouthful, and too small for two mouthfuls, and I don’t know what I’ll do with you if I don’t grind you up and make snuff for my nose.” “As you are strong, be merciful,” says Jack up in the tree. “Come down out of that, you little dwarf,” said the giant, “or I’ll tear you and the tree asunder.” So Jack came down. “Would you sooner be driving red-hot knives into one another’s hearts,” said the giant, “or would you sooner be fighting one another on red-hot f lags?” “Fighting on red-hot f lags is what I’m used to at home,” said Jack, “and your dirty feet will be sinking in them and my feet will be rising.” So then they began the fight. The ground that was hard they made soft, and the ground that was soft they made hard, and they made spring wells come up through the green f lags. They were like that all through the day, no one getting the upper hand of the other, and at last a little bird came and sat on the bush and said to Jack, “If you don’t make an end of him by sunset, he’ll make an end of you.” Then Jack put out his strength, and he brought the giant down on his knees. “Give me my life,” says the giant, “and I’ll give you the three best gifts.” “What are those?” said Jack. “A sword that nothing can stand against, and a suit that when you put it on, you will see everybody, and nobody will see you, and a pair of shoes that will make you ran faster than the wind blows.” “Where are they to be found?” said Jack. “In that red door you see there in the hill.” So Jack went and got them out. “Where will I try the sword?” says he. “Try it on that ugly black stump of a tree,” says the giant. “I see nothing blacker or uglier than your own head,” says Jack. And with that he made one stroke, and cut off the giant’s head that it went into the air, and he caught it on the sword as it was coming down, and made two halves of it. “It is well for you I did not join the body again,” said the head, “or you would have never been able to strike it off again.” “I did not give you the chance of that,” said Jack.

Then the bound put his teeth in her, and Bill brought her down, and she cried for mercy. “Give me my life,” she said, “and I’ll tell you where you’ll get your brother again, and his hound and horse.” “Where’s that?” said Bill. “ Do you see that rod over the fire?” said she; “take it down and go outside the door where you’ll see three green stones, and strike them with the rod, for they are your brother, and his horse and hound, and they’ll come to life again.” “I will, but I’ll make a green stone of you first,” said Bill, and he cut off her head with his sword. </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >昨天晚上，我去基尔塔坦路边一片宽阔的地方，听一些爱尔兰民歌。我正在等歌手们的时候，有位老人唱起那首关于多年前死去的乡村美人的歌，又说到一位他认识的歌手，说他的歌声太动听了，以至于连马经过时都不愿挪步，非得站在那里，转过头来，竖起耳朵听他唱。没过多久，来了大约二十个人，有大人，有男孩，也有女孩，他们都裹着头巾，都聚在树下听。有人唱起了《忠诚的恋人》，又有人唱起了《吉米啊，我的宝贝》，都是一些关于生离死别和流放的哀伤曲子。然后，他们中的一些人站起来，跳起了舞；同时有人欢快地跟着他们的节奏伴唱；之后，有人唱起《亲爱的埃布林》，这首关于相逢的欢歌每次都比其他的歌更能打动我的心，因为创作这首歌的人正在热恋中，每天都在山脚下为恋人唱这支歌，而我的整个孩提时代，每天都看得见那座山。歌声融入薄雾之中，飘入丛林之间，而每当我想到那些歌词时，它们也已然消逝，融入一代代人的生活中。时而，它是一个短语，时而，它又是一种心态，一种情绪模式，它将我的记忆带入更古老的歌谣之中，甚至是被遗忘的神话之中。我被带到了遥远的地方，似乎来到了四条河流中的一条，沿着河流，我在天堂的围墙下追随它，来到了知识和生命之树的脚下。在那些民间流传下来的歌谣或故事中，每一首歌谣或每一个故事都拥有一些词句或思想，能将你的思绪带往远方；或许你对它们的起源知之甚少。但是，你知道，它们就像中世纪的家谱，将绵延不断的贵族血统追溯到世界的源头。民间艺术，确实是最古老的思想贵族。因为它将稍纵即逝和琐碎无趣之物拒之门外，也拒绝徒有美貌或小聪明之物，更不必提粗俗与伪善；也因为，它将世世代代最淳朴和深刻的思想集于一身，故而，它是一切伟大艺术扎根的土壤。不管是在炉边的谈话，还是在路边的咏唱，抑或是刻在过梁上的铭文。总之，不论在哪儿，这些艺术经过一个人的整合和谋划，人们对艺术的欣赏便会在时机成熟之时迅速地传播开来。</td>
		<td class="en">Last night I went to a wide place on the Kiltartan road to listen to some Irish songs. While I waited for the singers an old man sang about that country beauty who died so many years ago, and spoke of a singer he had known who sang so beautifully that no horse would pass him, but must turn its head and cock its ears to listen. Presently a score of men and boys and girls, with shawls over their heads, gathered under the trees to listen. Somebody sang Sa Muirnín Díles, and then somebody else Jimmy Mo Mílestór, mournful songs of separation, of death, and of exile. Then some of the men stood up and began to dance, while another lilted the measure they danced to, and then somebody sang Eiblín a Rúin, that glad song of meeting which has always moved me more than other songs, because the lover who made it sang it to his sweetheart under the shadow of a mountain I looked at every day through my childhood. The voices melted into the twilight and were mixed into the trees, and when I thought of the words they too melted away, and were mixed with the generations of men. Now it was a phrase, now it was an attitude of mind, an emotional form, that had carried my memory to older verses, or even to forgotten mythologies. I was carried so far that it was as though I came to one of the four rivers1, and followed it under the wall of Paradise to the roots of the trees of knowledge and of life. There is no song or story handed down among the cottages that has not words and thoughts to carry one as far, for though one can know but a little of their ascent, one knows that they ascend like medieval genealogies through unbroken dignities to the beginning of the world. Folk art is, indeed, the oldest of the aristocracies of thought, and because it refuses what is passing and trivial, the merely clever and pretty, as certainly as the vulgar and insincere, and because it has gathered into itself the simplest and most unforgetable thoughts of the generations, it is the soil where all great art is rooted. Wherever it is spoken by the fireside, or sung by the roadside, or carved upon the lintel, appreciation of the arts that a single mind gives unity and design to, spreads quickly when its hour is come. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">In a society that has cast out imaginative tradition, only a few people— three or four thousand out of millions—favoured by their own characters and by happy circumstance, and only then after much labour, have understanding of imaginative things, and yet “the imagination is the man himself.” The churches in the Middle Age won all the arts into their service because men understood that when imagination is impoverished, a principal voice—some would say the only voice—for the awakening of wise hope and durable faith, and understanding charity, can speak but in broken words, if it does not fall silent. And so it has always seemed to me that we, who would re-awaken imaginative tradition by making old songs live again, or by gathering old stories into books, take part in the quarrel of Galilee. Those who are Irish and would spread foreign ways, which, for all but a few, are ways of spiritual poverty, take part also. Their part is with those who were of Jewry, and yet cried out, “If thou let this man go thou art not Caesar’s friend.” 2 1901.0</td></tr>
