		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘It is the best thing I have ever heard,’ answered the fox; and as they were two to one the bear had to be content, though in his heart he would much have preferred a good dinner at once to any friendship.</td>
		<td class="en">“这是我听过的最好的主意。”狐狸回答。由于它们三个当中已有两个同意了，熊也只好同意。尽管在熊心中，友情跟立刻饱餐一顿相比，根本不算什么。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >For a few days all went well; there was plenty of game in the forest, and even the wolf had as much to eat as he could wish.</td>
		<td class="en">刚开始的几天，一切都很顺利。森林里有很多猎物，就连狼都可以想吃多少就吃多少。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >One morning the fox as usual was going his rounds when he noticed a tall, slender tree, with a magpie’s nest in one of the top branches.</td>
		<td class="en">一天早上，狐狸像往常一样四处转悠，这时，它注意到一棵又高又细的树，最上面的一根树枝上有个喜鹊窝。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“要另找一棵能做这么好的雪鞋的树，可不容易啊。”狐狸一边回答，一边把头歪向一边，若有所思地盯着这棵树，“不过我不想当恶人，因此，如果你愿把你的一个孩子给我的话，我就会到别处找棵树做雪鞋。”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">可怜的喜鹊不知所措，只好同意。它心情沉重地飞回窝里，把它的一个孩子从窝里扔了出来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in triumph, while the magpie, though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one, found some comfort in the thought that only a bird of extraordinary wisdom would have dreamed of saving the rest by the sacrifice of the one.</td>
		<td class="en">狐狸叼住小喜鹊，得意地跑开了。而喜鹊尽管因为失去一个孩子而感到非常痛苦，但想到只有智慧出众的鸟儿才会想到牺牲一只小喜鹊保全其他几只，它又找到了些许安慰。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But what do you think happened?</td>
		<td class="en">但是，你猜随后怎样？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Why, a few days later, Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same tree, and a dreadful pang shot through the heart of the magpie as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest.</td>
		<td class="en">唉，几天之后，你可能会看到狐狸迈克尔恰好坐在同一棵树下。喜鹊透过窝里的孔隙瞥见了狐狸，一阵剧痛猛地袭上心头。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘What are you looking at?’ he asked in a trembling voice.</td>
		<td class="en">“你在看什么？”它声音颤抖地问。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘At this tree.</td>

		<td class="en">我刚刚在想，正好可以用它做一双多么好的雪鞋啊。”狐狸心不在焉地回答道，似乎说这些话时并没过多思考。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Oh, my brother, my dear little brother, don’t do that,’ cried the magpie, hopping about in his anguish.</td>
		<td class="en">“噢，我的大哥，我亲爱的大哥，别这么做。”喜鹊哭喊道，痛苦地跳来跳去。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">实在抱歉，让你失望了，但这真的不是我的错。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The only thing I can do for you is to offer to give up my snow-shoes altogether if you will throw me down one of your young ones in exchange.’</td>
		<td class="en">如果你肯把你的小喜鹊扔下来一只跟我作交换的话，我会彻底放弃做雪鞋的念头，这是我唯一能为你做的事情了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And the poor magpie, in spite of his wisdom, was obliged to throw another of his little ones out of the nest; and this time he was not able to console himself with the thought that he had been much cleverer than other people.</td>
		<td class="en">可怜的喜鹊，尽管聪慧，只好把自己的另一个小孩子扔出窝。这一次，它再也无法用自以为比别人更聪明这种想法来安慰自己了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He sat on the edge of his nest, his head drooping and his feathers all ruffled, looking the picture of misery.</td>
		<td class="en">它坐在窝边，耷拉着脑袋，羽毛蓬乱，看起来万分痛苦。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Indeed he was so different from the gay, jaunty magpie whom every creature in the forest knew, that a crow who was flying past, stopped to inquire what was the matter.</td>
		<td class="en">的确，它跟森林里的动物们所熟悉的那只欢快、活泼的喜鹊大不相同，以至于一只飞过的乌鸦停了下来，询问发生了什么事情。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Where are the two young ones who are not in the nest?’ asked he.</td>
		<td class="en">“你的那两个孩子呢？怎么不在窝里呀？”乌鸦问道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘I had to give them to the fox,’ replied the magpie in a quivering voice; ‘he has been here twice in the last week, and wanted to cut down my tree for the purpose of making snow-shoes out of it, and the only way I could buy him off was by giving him two of my young ones.’</td>
		<td class="en">“我不得不把它们给了狐狸。”喜鹊声音颤抖地回答，“上周，它来了两次，说想砍了这棵树，要用它做雪鞋。我只能把两个孩子送给它，才买通了它。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Oh, you fool,’ cried the crow, ‘the fox was only trying to frighten you.</td>
		<td class="en">“唉，你这个傻瓜。”乌鸦喊道，“狐狸只是来吓吓你而已。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He could not have cut down the tree, for he has neither axe nor knife.</td>
		<td class="en">它既没有斧子也没有刀，是不能把树砍倒的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Dear me, to think that you have sacrificed your young ones for nothing!</td>
		<td class="en">天哪，你居然白白牺牲了两个孩子啊！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Dear, dear! how could you be so very foolish!’</td>
		<td class="en">天哪，天哪！你怎么能这么笨呢！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And the crow flew away, leaving the magpie overcome with shame and sorrow.</td>
		<td class="en">乌鸦飞走了，留下满心羞愧与痛苦的喜鹊。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The next morning the fox came to his usual place in front of the tree, for he was hungry, and a nice young magpie would have suited him very well for dinner.</td>
		<td class="en">第二天早上，狐狸又来到老地方，来到了这棵树前，因为它饿了，一只美味的小喜鹊是再合适不过的美餐了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But this time there was no cowering, timid magpie to do his bidding, but a bird with his head erect and a determined voice.</td>
		<td class="en">但这次喜鹊不再胆小地蜷缩成一团，对狐狸言听计从了，反而昂着头，声音坚定。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘My good fox,’ said the magpie putting his head on one side and looking very wise—‘my good fox, if you take my advice, you will go home as fast as you can.</td>
		<td class="en">“亲爱的狐狸，”喜鹊边说边把头歪到一边，看起来很聪明的样子，“亲爱的狐狸，如果你肯听我的话，就赶紧滚回家去吧。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There is no use your talking about making snow-shoes out of this tree, when you have neither knife nor axe to cut it down with!’</td>
		<td class="en">你既没有砍树用的刀，也没有斧子，还说要用这棵树来做雪鞋，根本就是胡说！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Who has been teaching you wisdom?’ asked the fox, forgetting his manners in his surprise at this new turn of affairs.</td>
		<td class="en">“谁把你教得这么聪明？”狐狸对事情的新变化感到意外，都没顾得上风度，忙问道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘The crow, who paid me a visit yesterday,’ answered the magpie.</td>
		<td class="en">“乌鸦，它昨天来看我了。”喜鹊答道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘The crow was it?’ said the fox, ‘well, the crow had better not meet me for the future, or it may be the worse for him.’</td>
		<td class="en">“乌鸦？”狐狸说，“好吧，从今以后，最好别让乌鸦碰到我，否则更有它好受的。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >As Michael, the cunning beast, had no desire to continue the conversation, he left the forest; but when he came to the high road he laid himself at full length on the ground, stretching himself out, just as if he was dead.</td>
		<td class="en">狡猾的狐狸迈克尔无心再与喜鹊说话，就离开了森林。但一到大路上，它就伸直四肢，平躺在地上，仿佛死了一般。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">先把我从悬崖上扔下去，这样我的羽毛就会到处散落，无论谁看到我的羽毛，都会知道你比我聪明多了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This idea pleased the fox, for he had not yet forgiven the crow for depriving him of the young magpies, so he carried the crow to the edge of the precipice and threw him over, intending to go round by a path he knew and pick him up at the bottom.</td>
		<td class="en">听了这个主意，狐狸非常开心，因为它对乌鸦害自己没能吃到小喜鹊的事一直记恨在心，于是它把乌鸦带到悬崖边，把乌鸦扔了出去，打算要沿自己熟悉的一条路到崖底去捡乌鸦的尸体。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But no sooner had the fox let the crow go than he soared up into the air, and hovering just out of touch of his enemy’s jaws, he cried with a laugh: ‘Ah, fox! you know well how to catch, but you cannot keep.’</td>
		<td class="en">但狐狸刚把乌鸦扔出去，乌鸦就飞上了天空，在敌人嘴巴够不到的地方盘旋，一边大笑一边喊道：“啊，狐狸！你抓动物的本领很强，但守住动物的本领却不行。”</td></tr>
