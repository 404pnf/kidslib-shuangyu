		<td class="en">by O. Henry</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冒着使你厌倦的危险，在讲述这个情感激烈的故事之前，我们先来谈些有关几何学的话题。</td>
		<td class="en">At the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehement emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大自然的运动轨迹是圆周；艺术的运动轨迹是直线。自然之物呈圆形；人造之物则是有棱角的。一个在雪地中迷路的人在不知不觉中便走出完美的圆圈；而城市中的人，由于脚被长方形的街道和地板改变了本性，则远远地偏离了自我。</td>
		<td class="en">Nature moves in circles; Art in straight lines.The natural is rounded; the artificial is made up of angles.A man lost in the snow wanders, in spite of himself, in perfect circles; the city man’s feet, denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors, carry him ever away from himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >儿童圆圆的眼睛表示纯真；卖弄风情者的眼睛眯成一道细缝，则表明艺术的入侵。平平的嘴巴表明决定使诈；而谁没在为了真诚的吻而撅成圆形的嘴唇上读到过大自然最真情流露的抒情诗？</td>
		<td class="en">The round eyes of childhood typify innocence; the narrowed line of the flirt’s optic proves the invasion of art.The horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning; who has not read Nature’s most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >美就是大自然的完美状态；圆是它的主要属性。看看那一轮满月、迷人的高尔夫球、辉煌壮丽的庙宇圆顶、越橘馅饼、结婚戒指、马戏场、叫侍者的铃铛，以及喝酒时的“巡”。</td>
		<td class="en">Beauty is Nature in perfection; circularity is its chief attribute.Behold the full moon, the enchanting golf ball, the domes of splendid temples, the huckleberry pie, the wedding ring, the circus ring, the ring for the waiter, and the “round” of drinks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而另一方面，直线表示大自然已经有所偏离。想象一下维纳斯的紧身褡竟然变成了一件“直筒罩衣”。</td>
		<td class="en">On the other hand, straight lines show that Nature has been deflected.Imagine Venus’s girdle transformed into a “straight front”!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我们开始沿直线运动，转过一个个急转弯时，我们的本性就开始改变了。其结果是，大自然因为比艺术的适应性更强，便试图去遵守更严格的规则。这一结果往往是一个相当奇怪的产物——比如菊花奖、木醇威士忌、共和党密苏里州、脆皮花椰菜，还有纽约人。</td>
		<td class="en">When we begin to move in straight lines and turn sharp corners our natures begin to change.The consequence is that Nature, being more adaptive than Art, tries to conform to its sterner regulations.The result is often a rather curious product—for instance: A prize chrysanthemum, wood alcohol whiskey, a Republican Missouri, cauliflower au gratin, and a New Yorker.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大自然在大城市里消失得最快。原因在于几何学方面，而非道德层面。街道和建筑物的直线条，法律和社会习俗的方正刻板，笔直的人行道，所有生活方式中那些刻板、严厉、令人沮丧、强硬的规则——甚至娱乐和运动都是这样——都冷酷地展示着对大自然曲线的讥笑和挑衅。</td>
		<td class="en">Nature is lost quickest in a big city.The cause is geometrical, not moral.The straight lines of its streets and architecture, the rectangularity of its laws and social customs, the undeviating pavements, the hard, severe, depressing, uncompromising rules of all its ways—even of its recreation and sports—coldly exhibit a sneering defiance of the curved line of Nature.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，或许可以说，大城市表明了使圆成方的问题。或许还可以补充说一下，我们是先引入这个数学问题，然后才来讲述发生在肯塔基州的一个世仇故事的命运。这世仇被带入城市，而城市习惯使进入它的物体都符合它的棱角。</td>
		<td class="en">Wherefore, it may be said that the big city has demonstrated the problem of squaring the circle.And it may be added that this mathematical introduction precedes an account of the fate of a Kentucky feud that was imported to the city that has a habit of making its importations conform to its angles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个世仇开始于坎伯兰山区的福韦尔和哈克尼斯两个家族之间。这场民间的复仇争斗的第一个受害者是比尔·哈克尼斯家的一条猎负鼠的狗。哈克尼斯家族杀死了福韦尔家族的首领，从而为这一悲惨的损失实施了报复。福韦尔家族立即予以还击。他们擦亮他们的小口径步枪，使比尔·哈克尼斯跟随他的狗去到另一个国度成为了可能。在那里，不用挥动斧子，负鼠爬上树就掉下来了。</td>
		<td class="en">The feud began in the Cumberland Mountains between the Folwell and the Harkness families.The first victim of the homespun vendetta was a ’possum dog belonging to Bill Harkness.The Harkness family evened up this dire loss by laying out the chief of the Folwell clan.The Folwells were prompt at repartee.They oiled up their squirrel rifles and made it feasible for Bill Harkness to follow his dog to a land where the ’possums come down when treed without the stroke of an ax.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这场世仇闹了四十年。哈克尼斯家族的人一个一个地被枪杀了，或在耕地时，或在家里灯下的木屋窗旁，或从野营回来的路上，或在睡梦中，或在决斗中，或在酒醒酒醉之时，在独自一人或家族聚会之时，抑或在有或没有防备之时。以类似的方式，福韦尔家族的家谱之树也一枝枝地被砍掉了，因为该地区的传统就是这么规定并被获准这么执行的。</td>
		<td class="en">The feud flourished for forty years.Harknesses were shot at the plough, through their lamp-lit cabin windows, coming from camp-meeting, asleep, in duello, sober and otherwise, singly and in family groups, prepared and unprepared.Folwells had the branches of their family tree lopped off in similar ways, as the traditions of their country prescribed and authorized.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >渐渐地，经过一再修枝，两个家族都只剩下了一个家族成员。然后，卡尔·哈克尼斯很可能考虑到对这场争斗的深究会给世仇带上过于鲜明的个人特征，便突然从坎伯兰地区消失了，以逃脱结仇的福韦尔家族的最后一人萨姆的复仇之手。坎伯兰地区平静了。</td>
		<td class="en">By and by the pruning left but a single member of each family.And then Cal Harkness, probably reasoning that further pursuance of the controversy would give a too decided personal flavor to the feud, suddenly disappeared from the relieved Cumberlands, baulking the avenging hand of Sam, the ultimate opposing Folwell.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一年后，萨姆·福韦尔得知他那还未被降服的宿敌住在纽约城里。萨姆将院子里的铁制大洗衣锅翻转过来，刮掉些烟灰，再掺上些猪油，用这种混合物擦亮他的靴子。他穿上了现成配好的一套：原本淡棕色、现已染成黑色的外衣，一件白领的白衬衫，还在毯制手提包里装上了几件斯巴达式的亚麻制内衣。他从钩子上拿下他的小口径步枪，却又叹了口气把它放了回去。不管这种习惯在坎伯兰山区是如何合情合理，或许纽约不会允许他在沿百老汇的高楼大厦间猎捕松鼠。他从写字台抽屉里翻出一把左轮手枪。枪已经很旧，但还能用，似乎在宣告它是大都市冒险和复仇最合适的武器。萨姆把这把枪还有一把装在皮革鞘里的猎刀都放在毯制手提包里。当他骑在骡子背上，向山下的火车站出发时，这个福韦尔家族的最后一员从鞍上转过身，严肃地看着雪松丛中一小群白杨松碑石，那标明了福韦尔家墓地的位置。</td>
		<td class="en">A year afterward Sam Folwell learned that his hereditary, unsuppressed enemy was living in New York City.Sam turned over the big iron wash-pot in the yard, scraped off some of the soot, which he mixed with lard and shined his boots with the compound.He put on his store clothes of butternut dyed black, a white shirt and collar, and packed a carpet-sack with Spartan lingerie.He took his squirrel rifle from its hooks, but put it back again with a sigh.However ethical and plausible the habit might be in the Cumberlands, perhaps New York would not swallow his pose of hunting squirrels among the skyscrapers along Broadway.An ancient but reliable Colt’s revolver that he resurrected from a bureau drawer seemed to proclaim itself the pink of weapons for metropolitan adventure and vengeance.This and a hunting-knife in a leather sheath, Sam packed in the carpet-sack.As he started, Muleback, for the lowland railroad station the last Folwell turned in his saddle and looked grimly at the little cluster of white-pine slabs in the clump of cedars that marked the Folwell burying-ground.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >萨姆·福韦尔到达纽约时已是夜里。他仍然在自然的自由圆周中运动和生活，还没有察觉到大城市中那些可怕无情、焦躁不安的锋利棱角正在黑暗中等待着他，要包围住他那圆圆的心脏和大脑，要把他铸造成其成千上万个已变形的受害者的形状。一个出租车司机把他从一阵混乱中挑了出来，就如同萨姆自己经常从一堆随风飘荡的秋叶中挑出一枚坚果一样，很快将他送到了一家与他的靴子和毯制手提包很相称的旅馆。第二天早晨，福韦尔家的最后一员向这个掩护着最后一位哈克尼斯家族成员的城市发起突击。左轮手枪别在外衣下面，上面还系了条窄窄的皮带以确保安全；猎刀挂在他的肩胛骨之间，刀柄在外衣衣领下面一英尺处。他就知道这么多——卡尔·哈克尼斯在这座城里的某个地方驾驶快运货车，而他，萨姆·福韦尔是来杀他的。他踏上了人行横道，眼睛开始发红，世仇之恨涌入心中。</td>
		<td class="en">Sam Folwell arrived in New York in the night.Still moving and living in the free circles of nature, he did not perceive the formidable, pitiless, restless, fierce angles of the great city waiting in the dark to close about the rotundity of his heart and brain and mould him to the form of its millions of re-shaped victims.A cabby picked him out of the whirl, as Sam himself had often picked a nut from a bed of wind-tossed autumn leaves, and whisked him away to a hotel commensurate to his boots and carpet-sack.On the next morning the last of the Folwells made his sortie into the city that sheltered the last Harkness.The Colt was thrust beneath his coat and secured by a narrow leather belt; the hunting-knife hung between his shoulder-blades, with the haft an inch below his coat collar.He knew this much—that Cal Harkness drove an express wagon somewhere in that town, and that he, Sam Folwell, had come to kill him.And as he stepped upon the sidewalk the red came into his eye and the feud-hate into his heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >中心大街的喧闹声将他吸引了过去。他非常期望能看到卡尔沿街而来，穿着有袖衬衫，手里拿着鞭子和水壶，就如同他会在法兰克福或者劳雷尔市看到他一样。但一个小时过去了，卡尔并没有出现。或许他正埋伏着，等待着从一扇门或一扇窗户后面向他开枪。萨姆警觉地审视了一会儿那些门窗。</td>
		<td class="en">The clamor of the central avenues drew him thitherward.He had half expected to see Cal coming down the street in his shirt-sleeves, with a jug and a whip in his hand, just as he would have seen him in Frankfort or Laurel City.But an hour went by and Cal did not appear.Perhaps he was waiting in ambush, to shoot him from a door or a window.Sam kept a sharp eye on doors and windows for a while.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大约中午时分，城市厌倦了与它的老鼠玩耍，突然用它直直的光线挤压他。</td>
		<td class="en">About noon the city tired of playing with its mouse and suddenly squeezed him with its straight lines.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >萨姆·福韦尔站在由两条宽阔的城市干道呈直角形成的交叉路口上。他看向四个方向，看到世界脱离了轨道，被水准仪和卷尺隔成了一个有边有角的平面。所有的生命都按照规则，在一定的范围内机械地、刻板地沿轨迹运行。生命之根是呈立方体的根；存在的度量衡是平方单位制。人群站成笔直的一排涌入；可怕的喧闹和碰撞使他眩晕。</td>
		<td class="en">Sam Folwell stood where two great, rectangular arteries of the city cross.He looked four ways, and saw the world burled from its orbit and reduced by spirit level and tape to an edged and cornered plane.All life moved on tracks, in grooves, according to system, within boundaries, by rote.The root of life was the cube root; the measure of existence was square measure.People streamed by in straight rows; the horrible din and crash stupefied him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >萨姆靠在一幢石制建筑的锋利的拐角处。成千上万张脸经过他身旁，却没有一张脸转向他。他突然有一种愚蠢的恐惧感，感到自己已经死了，成了一个幽灵，他们看不到他，也抓不住他。这样，他在这座城市里陷入了深深的孤独之中。</td>
		<td class="en">Sam leaned against the sharp corner of a stone building.Those faces passed him by thousands, and none of them were turned toward him.A sudden foolish fear that he had died and was a spirit, and that they could not see him, seized him.And then the city smote him with loneliness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个胖子脱离了人潮，站在几英尺外等车。萨姆悄悄地来到他身旁，以大过喧闹声的声音冲他耳朵喊道：</td>
		<td class="en">A fat man dropped out of the stream and stood a few feet distant, waiting for his car.Sam crept to his side and shouted above the tumult into his ear:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“兰金斯家的猪比我们家的那一群都肥，但那周围的饲料坚果好过下面——”</td>
		<td class="en">“The Rankinses’ hogs weighed more’n ourn a whole passel, but the mast in thar neighborhood was a fine chance better than what it was down—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那胖子毫不张扬地走开，还买了炒栗子来掩饰他的恐慌。</td>
		<td class="en">The fat man moved away unostentatiously, and bought roasted chestnuts to cover his alarm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >萨姆感到他需要一滴私酿的威士忌酒。街道对面，人们穿梭在弹簧门内外。他可以瞥几眼那间闪亮耀眼的酒吧，以及酒吧里华丽的装潢。这个怀有世仇的人穿过街道，想要走进去。艺术再一次摒弃了他所熟悉的圆形。萨姆的手没找到门把手——他的手在长方形的黄铜门牌和抛光橡木上滑动，却什么都找不到，就连像大头针头那么大的能用手抓住的东西都没有。他窘迫得脸都红了，心都碎了，从那没有锁扣的门旁走开，坐在一级台阶上。一根警棍在他的肋间挠了挠。</td>
		<td class="en">Sam felt the need of a drop of mountain dew.Across the street men passed in and out through swinging doors.Brief glimpses could be had of a glistening bar and its bedeckings.The feudist crossed and essayed to enter.Again had Art eliminated the familiar circle.Sam’s hand found no door-knob—it slid, in vain, over a rectangular brass plate and polished oak with nothing even so large as a pin’s head upon which his fingers might close.Abashed, reddened, heartbroken, he walked away from the bootless door and sat upon a step.A locust club tickled him in the ribs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你，自己去逛逛吧。”警察说道，“你已经在这附近闲逛得够久了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Take a walk for yourself,” said the policeman.“You’ve been loafing around here long enough.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在下一个拐角处，萨姆耳边响起一声尖锐刺耳的口哨声。他转过身，看见一个绷着脸的无赖正怒视着他，那人下面是一台冒着蒸汽的机器，上面堆满花生。他打算穿过街道。一台巨大的发动机，没有骡子拉就跑起来了，发出公牛般的叫声，散发出冒烟油灯的气味，擦着他的膝盖嗖嗖驶过。一个出租马车司机用轮毂猛地撞了他一下，并向他解释说，友善的话是为别的场合而发明的。一个骑摩托车的人疯狂地按响铃，并使他生平第一次确证了出租车司机的话。一个穿着闪光丝绸背心的胖女人用胳膊肘撞他的后背，一个报童一边忧心忡忡地不断向他扔香蕉皮，一边小声嘀咕着：“我讨厌这么做——但如果有人盯着我，让我这么做，我也无所谓。”</td>
		<td class="en">At the next corner a shrill whistle sounded in Sam’s ear.He wheeled around and saw a black-browed villain scowling at him over peanuts heaped on a steaming machine.He started across the street.An immense engine, running without mules, with the voice of a bull and the smell of a smoky lamp, whizzed past, grazing his knee.A cab-driver bumped him with a hub and explained to him that kind words were invented to be used on other occasions.A motorman clanged his bell wildly and, for once in his life, corroborated a cab-driver.A large lady in a changeable silk waist dug an elbow into his back, and a newsy pensively pelted him with banana rinds, murmuring, “I hates to do it—but if anybody seen me let it pass!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡尔·哈克尼斯下班了，安放好他的快速货车，转过建筑物锋利的边缘。由于设计师的狂妄，那幢建筑被设计成了安全剃刀的形状。在行色匆匆的人群中，他的眼睛挑出了三码之外那个幸存的、该死的、不共戴天的家族仇人。</td>
		<td class="en">Cal Harkness, his day’s work over and his express wagon stabled, turned the sharp edge of the building that, by the cheek of architects, is modelled upon a safety razor.Out of the mass of hurrying people his eye picked up, three yards away, the surviving bloody and implacable foe of his kith and kin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他猛地停了下来，犹豫了一下。他没带任何武器，而且大感意外。但是萨姆·福韦尔那山里人敏锐的眼睛已经认出了他。</td>
		<td class="en">He stopped short and wavered for a moment, being unarmed and sharply surprised.But the keen mountaineer’s eye of Sam Folwell had picked him out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在熙熙攘攘的人流中，突然冒出一股清泉，泛起一圈涟漪，只听萨姆的声音喊道：</td>
		<td class="en">There was a sudden spring, a ripple in the stream of passersby and the sound of Sam’s voice crying:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好，卡尔！见到你我真是太高兴了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Howdy, Cal!I’m durned glad to see ye.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在百老汇第五大道和第二十三号街的拐角处，坎伯兰的两个宿敌握手言和了。</td>
		<td class="en">And in the angles of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and Twenty-third Street the Cumberland feudists shook hands.</td></tr>
