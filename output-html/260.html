		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在一幢漂亮的海边小别墅里，一位个子矮小的年轻人坐在窗边，努力让自己相信他是在看报。那时大概是早上八点半。外面，玫瑰开得很绚烂，沐浴在早晨的阳光中，像一个个倾侧着的小火盆。这位年轻人看看桌子，又看看时钟，再看看他自己的那块大大的银表。他的脸上浮现出一种坚忍的神情。他接着站起身，回想起房间里挂在墙上的那些油画，便仔细但又心怀敌意地看了看那幅《雄鹿在海湾》。他试图打开钢琴盖，却发现钢琴是锁着的。他在一面小镜子里看到了自己的脸，然后他捋了捋自己棕色的胡须，眼睛顿然神采飞扬。他的长相并不难看。他捻了捻胡须。他身材有些矮小，人却机灵活泼又精力充沛。转身离开镜子时，一种自我怜悯而又自我欣赏的神情浮现在他的脸上。</td>
		<td class="en">A rather small young man sat by the window of a pretty seaside cottage trying to persuade himself that he was reading the newspaper.It was about half-past eight in the morning.Outside, the glory roses hung in the morning sunshine like little bowls of fire tipped up.The young man looked at the table, then at the clock, then at his own big silver watch.An expression of stiff endurance came on to his face.Then he rose and reflected on the oil-paintings that hung on the walls of the room, giving careful but hostile attention to “The Stag at Bay”.He tried the lid of the piano, and found it locked.He caught sight of his own face in a little mirror, pulled his brown moustache, and an alert interest sprang into his eyes.He was not ill-favoured.He twisted his moustache.His figure was rather small, but alert and vigorous.As he turned from the mirror a look of self-commiseration mingled with his appreciation of his own physiognomy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他深感压抑，走进了花园。他的夹克反而看起来轻松明快，一点也不沮丧。夹克是新的，穿在原本自信的他身上，使他看上去更加帅气自信了。他审视着草坪旁那棵繁茂的臭椿树，信步来到另一株植物前。那是一棵被压弯了的苹果树，长得更为繁茂，树上结满了红棕色的苹果。他四下看了看，摘下一个苹果，背对着房子，干脆地咬了一口。让他惊讶的是，苹果原来很甜。于是他又咬了一口。然后他再次转过身查看卧室的窗，透过那些窗可以俯瞰花园。他看到一个女人的身影，惊了一下，但那只不过是他的妻子。她正透过窗户凝望大海，显然没看到他。</td>
		<td class="en">In a state of self-suppression, he went through into the garden.His jacket, however, did not look dejected.It was new, and had a smart and self-confident air, sitting upon a confident body.He contemplated the Tree of Heaven that flourished by the lawn, then sauntered on to the next plant.There was more promise in a crooked apple tree covered with brown-red fruit.Glancing round, he broke off an apple and, with his back to the house, took a clean, sharp bite.To his surprise the fruit was sweet.He took another.Then again he turned to survey the bedroom windows overlooking the garden.He started, seeing a woman’s figure; but it was only his wife.She was gazing across to the sea, apparently ignorant of him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他看着她，注视了她好一会。她是个漂亮的女人，看起来比他大些，面容苍白却很健康，脸上带着一种渴望的神色。一头红褐色的头发层层叠叠地盘在她的前额上。她并没有把视线落在他和他的世界，而是注视着远处的大海。她竟继续走神，对他视而不见，这令她丈夫很恼火；他摘下几个红苹果，朝窗户扔去。她惊了一下，瞥了他一眼，朝他灿烂地一笑，目光又移开了。随即，她便从窗前走开了。他也走进了屋去看她。她举止优雅，神情高傲，身着一袭轻柔的平纹细布白裙。</td>
		<td class="en">For a moment or two he looked at her, watching her.She was a good-looking woman, who seemed older than he, rather pale, but healthy, her face yearning.Her rich auburn hair was heaped in folds on her forehead.She looked apart from him and his world, gazing away to the sea.It irked her husband that she should continue abstracted and in ignorance of him; he pulled poppy fruits and threw them at the window.She started, glanced at him with a wild smile, and looked away again.Then almost immediately she left the window.He went indoors to meet her.She had a fine carriage, very proud, and wore a dress of soft white muslin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我已经等了够久了。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ve been waiting long enough,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“等我还是等早餐？”她淡淡地说，“你知道我们说好九点的。我本以为，旅行之后你会睡个懒觉。”“你知道我总在五点起床，六点过后就无法再呆在床上了。在这样的早上，躺在床上和躺在矿坑里没什么两样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“For me or for breakfast?” she said lightly.” You know we said nine o’clock. I should have thought you could have slept after the journey.”“You know I’m always up at five, and I couldn’t stop in bed after six.You might as well be in pit as in bed, on a morning like this.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没想到这地方会让你想起矿坑。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I shouldn’t have thought the pit would occur to you, here.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她踱来踱去，审视着这间屋子，看了看玻璃罩下的饰品。而他则立在壁炉前的地毯上，很不安地注视着她，露出一种不情愿的溺爱神色。她对着这个房子耸了耸肩膀。</td>
		<td class="en">She moved about examining the room, looking at the ornaments under glass covers.He, planted on the hearthrug, watched her rather uneasily, and grudgingly indulgent.She shrugged her shoulders at the apartment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来，”她说着，拉起他的胳膊，“我们去花园吧，等科茨太太把早餐端来再回来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come,” she said, taking his arm, “let us go into the garden till Mrs Coates brings the tray.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我希望她能快点。”他捋着胡子说。她笑了一声，倚着他的胳膊走了出去。他点着了烟斗。</td>
		<td class="en">“I hope she’ll be quick,” he said, pulling his moustache.She gave a short laugh, and leaned on his arm as they went.He had lighted a pipe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们下楼的时候，科茨太太走进了屋子。这位讨人喜欢、腰板直挺的老太太匆忙赶到窗外来一睹她的来客的容貌。那对年轻的夫妇沿小路走下去，丈夫挽着妻子，步伐安闲自在，样子泰然自若。看着他们，她那双中国蓝的眼睛里绽放出光彩。这位女房东用那轻柔的约克郡口音自言自语起来：</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs Coates entered the room as they went down the steps.The delightful, erect old lady hastened to the window for a good view of her visitors.Her china-blue eyes were bright as she watched the young couple go down the path, he walking in an easy, confident fashion, with his wife, on his arm.The landlady began talking to herself in a soft, Yorkshire accent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们恰好一般高。虽然他在其他方面不如她，但是，我觉得她不会嫁一个比自己个头矮的人的。”这时她的孙女走了进来，把一只盘子放在了桌上。小女孩来到老太太的身边。</td>
		<td class="en">“Just of a height they are.She wouldn’t ha’ married a man less than herself in stature, I think, though he’s not her equal otherwise.”Here her granddaughter came in, setting a tray on the table.The girl went to the old woman’s side.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“奶奶，他一直在吃苹果呢。”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“He’s been eating the apples, gran’,” she said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是吗，我的小乖乖？如果他乐意，为什么不让他吃呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Has he, my pet?Well, if he’s happy, why not?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外面，那位俊朗的年轻人不耐烦地听着茶杯叮当作响。终于，这对夫妻如释重负地叹了口气，进屋来吃早餐了。他吃了一会，停了片刻，说道：</td>
		<td class="en">Outside, the young, well-favoured man listened with impatience to the chink of the teacups.At last, with a sigh of relief, the couple came in to breakfast.After he had eaten for some time, he rested a moment and said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你觉得这里比布里德灵顿要好些吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you think it’s any better place than Bridlington?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，”她说，“好很多啊！况且在这里我觉得舒适自在——对我来说，这并不像个陌生的海滨。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I do,” she said, “infinitely!Besides, I am at home here—it’s not like a strange sea-side place to me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你以前在这里呆过多长时间？”</td>
		<td class="en">“How long were you here?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“两年。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Two years.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他若有所思地吃着。</td>
		<td class="en">He ate reflectively.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我原本以为你宁可去一个新地方。”过了很长时间他才开口说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I should ha’ thought you’d rather go to a fresh place,” he said at length.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她静静地坐着，接着她谨慎地试探着问他道：</td>
		<td class="en">She sat very silent, and then, delicately, put out a feeler.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么？”她说，“你觉得我不会快活吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why?”she said.“Do you think I shan’t enjoy myself?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他舒心地笑了笑，往面包上涂了一层厚厚的果酱。</td>
		<td class="en">He laughed comfortably, putting the marmalade thick on his bread.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我希望你快活。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I hope so,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她又不理睬他了。</td>
		<td class="en">She again took no notice of him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但弗兰克，别在村里说这事。”她随意地说道，“不要说我是谁，也不要说我曾经住在这儿。特别是这里没有我想见的人，而且如果有人认出我来，我们就会觉得不自在了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But don’t say anything about it in the village, Frank,” she said casually.“Don’t say who I am, or that I used to live here.There’s nobody I want to meet, particularly, and we should never feel free if they knew me again.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，你为什么要来？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why did you come, then?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘为什么’？你难道理解不了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Why?’Can’t you understand why?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果你不想见任何人的话，我真不理解。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not if you don’t want to know anybody.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我来为的是看这个地方，不是看人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I came to see the place, not the people.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他没再说什么了。</td>
		<td class="en">He did not say any more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“女人，”她说道，“是不同于男人的。我不知道为什么想来——但是我确实想来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Women,” she said, “are different from men.I don’t know why I wanted to come—but I did.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她周到地又帮他续了一杯咖啡。</td>
		<td class="en">She helped him to another cup of coffee, solicitously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“只是，”她继续说，“别在村里谈论我。”她笑着，声音有些颤抖。“你知道，我不想让别人提起我的过去，跟我对着干。”她用指尖动了一下桌布上的面包屑。</td>
		<td class="en">“Only,” she resumed, “don’t talk about me in the village.”She laughed shakily.“I don’t want my past brought up against me, you know.”And she moved the crumbs on the cloth with her finger-tip.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一边喝咖啡，一边看着她，接着吸了下胡须，放下杯子，冷静地说：</td>
		<td class="en">He looked at her as he drank his coffee; he sucked his moustache, and putting down his cup, said phlegmatically:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我敢打赌，你有很多往事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll bet you’ve had a lot of past.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她低头看着桌布，眼中带有一丝愧疚，这让他感到愉快。</td>
		<td class="en">She looked with a little guiltiness, that flattered him, down at the tablecloth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对了，”她亲柔地说，“你不会把我是谁泄露出去，是吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well,” she said, caressive, “you won’t give me away, who I am, will you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不会，”他笑着宽慰她说，“我不会把你是谁泄露出去的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” he said, comforting, laughing, “I won’t give you away.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他很高兴。</td>
		<td class="en">He was pleased.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她却保持沉默。过了一会，她抬起头说：</td>
		<td class="en">She remained silent.After a moment or two she lifted her head, saying:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我得跟科茨太太安排一下，还要做很多事情。所以今儿早上你最好一人出去——一点钟我们一起在家吃午饭。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ve got to arrange with Mrs Coates, and do various things.So you’d better go out by yourself this morning—and we’ll be in to dinner at one.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是你不会整个早上都和科茨太太安排吧。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“But you can’t be arranging with Mrs Coates all morning,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，对了——然后我有几封信要写，我还要把我裙子上的污渍弄掉。今天早上我还有很多琐事要做。你最好自己出去。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, well—then I’ve some letters to write, and I must get that mark out of my skirt.I’ve got plenty of little things to do this morning.You’d better go out by yourself.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他觉察到她想撇开他，于是等她上了楼，他便拿起帽子，强忍住怒火，漫步走向了峭壁。</td>
		<td class="en">He perceived that she wanted to be rid of him, so that when she went upstairs, he took his hat and lounged out on to the cliffs, suppressedly angry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久，她也出门了。她头戴一顶插着玫瑰花的帽子，脖子上戴着的那条长长的蕾丝披巾，一直垂到白裙子上。她惴惴不安地撑起阳伞，半边脸埋在了阳伞的彩色阴影里。她沿着窄窄的石板路走着，石板已经被渔夫踩得凹陷下去了。她好像要躲开周围的事物，仿佛在阳伞的小小阴影下，她才安全。</td>
		<td class="en">Presently she too came out.She wore a hat with roses, and a long lace scarf hung over her white dress.Rather nervously, she put up her sunshade, and her face was half-hidden in its coloured shadow.She went along the narrow track of flag-stones that were worn hollow by the feet of the fishermen.She seemed to be avoiding her surroundings, as if she remained safe in the little obscurity of her parasol.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她走过教堂，顺着小巷走下去，一直走到路边的高墙旁。在墙边，她放慢了脚步，终于在一个敞开的门前停住。这扇门就像一幅镶嵌在漆黑墙面上的明亮的图画，闪闪发光。门的另一边，像是被施了魔法一般，各式各样的阴影落在阳光照耀的院子里，落在蓝色和白色海卵石铺的小路上，远处绿油油的草坪散发着光辉，草坪边一棵月桂树也闪闪发着光。她很紧张，蹑手蹑脚地走进庭院，瞥了一眼那间被阴影覆盖的房子。没有拉窗帘的窗户看起来黑暗而且没有生气，厨房的门是敞开的。她犹豫不决地往前迈了一步，又向前迈了一步，趄着身子，满怀渴望地向花园里面走去。</td>
		<td class="en">She passed the church, and went down the lane till she came to a high wall by the wayside.Under this she went slowly, stopping at length by an open doorway, which shone like a picture of light in the dark wall.There in the magic beyond the doorway, patterns of shadow lay on the sunny court, on the blue and white sea-pebbles of its paving, while a green lawn glowed beyond, where a bay tree glittered at the edges.She tiptoed nervously into the courtyard, glancing at the house that stood in shadow.The uncurtained windows looked black and soulless, the kitchen door stood open.Irresolutely she took a step forward, and again forward, leaning, yearning, towards the garden beyond.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她就快来到房子的拐角了，这时一个人踏着沉重的步子，嘎吱嘎吱地穿过树林走了过来。出现在她面前的是一个园丁。他端着一个柳条编的托盘，熟透了的深红色醋栗在上面滚着。他缓慢地向前移动着。</td>
		<td class="en">She had almost gained the corner of the house when a heavy step came crunching through the trees.A gardener appeared before her.He held a wicker tray on which were rolling great, dark red gooseberries, overripe.He moved slowly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“花园今天不对外开放。”他轻声对这位妩媚的女人说，而她已经准备好离去了。</td>
		<td class="en">“The garden isn’t open today,” he said quietly to the attractive woman, who was poised for retreat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为惊讶，她沉默了一会。这花园怎么会对外开放？</td>
		<td class="en">For a moment she was silent with surprise.How should it be public at all?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么时间对外开放？”她机敏地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“When is it open?”she asked, quick-witted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“每周二和每周五，教区长允许参观者进园。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The rector lets visitors in on Fridays and Tuesdays.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她静静地站着，思索着。教区长把自己的花园对外开放，真是奇怪呀！</td>
		<td class="en">She stood still, reflecting.How strange to think of the rector opening his garden to the public!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是所有的人都会在教堂吧，”她诱哄着对这人说，“这儿不会有人过来，是吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But everybody will be at church,” she said coaxingly to the man.“There’ll be nobody here, will there?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >园丁移了移身子，硕大的醋栗翻滚着。</td>
		<td class="en">He moved, and the big gooseberries rolled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“教区长在他的新宅子里住。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“The rector lives at the new rectory,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这两个人都静静地站着。园丁不愿意让她走开。最终，她带着迷人的笑容转向园丁。</td>
		<td class="en">The two stood still.He did not like to ask her to go.At last she turned to him with a winning smile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我可不可以偷偷看‘一眼’这里的玫瑰啊？”她哄着他，带着任性撒娇的语气。</td>
		<td class="en">“Might I have ONE peep at the roses?”she coaxed, with pretty wilfulness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想这应该没什么要紧的，”他说着就把身体移开了，“你不能停留太长时间——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t suppose it would matter,” he said, moving aside: “you won’t stop long—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她向前走着，一会就把园丁忘了。她的表情变得不太自然，步子也迈得急切了。她瞥了瞥四周，发现所有对着草坪的窗子都没窗帘，也都很暗。这房子看起来毫无生气，好像仍在使用中，但是没有人居住。似乎有一个阴影从她身旁走过去。她穿过草坪，走向花园，穿过一个深红色蔓性蔷薇攀缘而成的鲜亮的拱门。花园另外一边被晨雾笼罩着的是柔和的蓝色海湾；天边的黑岩岬，在蓝色的水天交接处时隐时现。她的脸开始泛光，露出既痛苦又喜悦的表情。从她脚下站着的地方开始，花园出现了陡坡，四处都布满了花。远处陡坡下面，黑压压的树梢遮住了溪流。</td>
		<td class="en">She went forward, forgetting the gardener in a moment.Her face became strained, her movements eager.Glancing round, she saw all the windows giving on to the lawn were curtainless and dark.The house had a sterile appearance, as if it were still used, but not inhabited.A shadow seemed to go over her.She went across the lawn towards the garden, through an arch of crimson ramblers, a gate of colour.There beyond lay the soft blue sea with the bay, misty with morning, and the farthest headland of black rock jutting dimly out between blue and blue of the sky and water.Her face began to shine, transfigured with pain and joy.At her feet the garden fell steeply, all a confusion of flowers, and away below was the darkness of tree-tops covering the beck.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她转身走进花园，置身在开得正绚烂的鲜花丛中。她知道小角落里的紫杉树下有个座位。而且那里有一个露台，里面开着各种各样的花，从露台处向下延伸出两条小路，一边一条，被花园隔开。她收起阳伞，在花丛中慢慢地踱步。四周满是玫瑰花丛，一排又一排，有些玫瑰从柱子上垂下来摇曳着，有些则在挺直的灌木丛上，保持着平衡。开阔的地面上还有很多其他的花。如果她抬起头来，她会看到花园另一边，海面被浪抬高了，还可以看到科德角半岛。</td>
		<td class="en">She turned to the garden that shone with sunny flowers around her.She knew the little corner where was the seat beneath the yew tree.Then there was the terrace where a great host of flowers shone, and from this, two paths went down, one at each side of the garden.She closed her sunshade and walked slowly among the many flowers.All round were rose bushes, big banks of roses, then roses hanging and tumbling from pillars, or roses balanced on the standard bushes.By the open earth were many other flowers.If she lifted her head, the sea was upraised beyond, and the Cape.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她沿着一条小路依依不舍地慢慢前行，仿佛回到了过去。突然间她的手触碰到了深红的玫瑰，那些花柔软如天鹅绒一般，她若有所思地抚摸着它们，自己却毫无察觉，就像母亲有时会不知不觉地抚摸孩子的小手一样。她身子稍微前倾，去闻那花香。然后她心不在焉地向前漫步。偶尔看到火红的没有香气的玫瑰花，她会停住脚步。她停下来凝视着花朵，仿佛不知道那是什么。当她在一簇粉色的花瓣前驻足时，那往日的亲密柔情又涌上心头。接着她沉醉于花丛中间的白色玫瑰，那花朵微微发绿，如冰雪般纯洁。于是，缓缓地，她就像一只凄楚的白蝶，沿着小径飞舞，最终来到了一个满是玫瑰的小露台跟前。一堆绚烂夺目的玫瑰似乎挤满了露台。它们是如此纷繁、如此鲜艳，对此，她感到羞涩。这些花好像在说笑。她觉得自己仿佛置身于一群陌生人中。这让她兴奋不已，陶醉其中，忘记了自己。她兴奋得脸都红了。空气里满是花朵的芬芳。</td>
		<td class="en">Slowly she went down one path, lingering, like one who has gone back into the past.Suddenly she was touching some heavy crimson roses that were soft as velvet, touching them thoughtfully, without knowing, as a mother sometimes fondles the hand of her child.She leaned slightly forward to catch the scent.Then she wandered on in abstraction.Sometimes a flame-coloured, scentless rose would hold her arrested.She stood gazing at it as if she could not understand it.Again the same softness of intimacy came over her, as she stood before a tumbling heap of pink petals.Then she wondered over the white rose, that was greenish, like ice, in the centre.So, slowly, like a white, pathetic butterfly, she drifted down the path, coming at last to a tiny terrace all full of roses.They seemed to fill the place, a sunny, gay throng.She was shy of them, they were so many and so bright.They seemed to be conversing and laughing.She felt herself in a strange crowd.It exhilarated her, carried her out of herself.She flushed with excitement.The air was pure scent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她匆忙走到白玫瑰丛中的小座位旁，坐了下来。她那绯红色的遮阳伞极大地破坏了周围的色调。她很安静地坐着，忘了自己的存在。她只是一朵玫瑰，一朵无法盛开但仍含苞待放的玫瑰。一只小苍蝇飞落在她的膝盖上，落到了她白裙子上。她盯着那只苍蝇，仿佛它落在了一朵玫瑰上。她已经不是往日的她了。</td>
		<td class="en">Hastily, she went to a little seat among the white roses, and sat down.Her scarlet sunshade made a hard blot of colour.She sat quite still, feeling her own existence lapse.She was no more than a rose, a rose that could not quite come into blossom, but remained tense.A little fly dropped on her knee, on her white dress.She watched it, as if it had fallen on a rose.She was not herself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，她看到一个阴影从面前闪过，她被吓了一大跳，她看到了一个人。是一个男人，他穿拖鞋走了进来，走路没有声响。他身穿一件亚麻外套。大好的晨光被破坏了，花园的魔力也不复存在了。现在她只是怕别人会向自己发问。他走上前来。她站起身。然后，她看着他，一股力量袭遍她全身，她又跌坐在椅子上。</td>
		<td class="en">Then she started cruelly as a shadow crossed her and a figure moved into her sight.It was a man who had come in slippers, unheard.He wore a linen coat.The morning was shattered, the spell vanished away.She was only afraid of being questioned.He came forward.She rose.Then, seeing him, the strength went from her and she sank on the seat again.</td></tr>
