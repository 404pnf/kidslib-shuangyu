		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对福图纳托加于我的无数次伤害，我一直尽力一忍再忍，但当他斗胆侮辱了我，我发誓一定要报复。你如此了解我的脾性，绝不会认为我只是威胁着说说而已。总有一天我会报仇雪恨，这是一个明确设定的目标——正是因为此目标设定得如此明确，我没有想到会有危险。我必须做到既惩罚了他，又使自己免于惩罚。若复仇者自己受到了惩罚，那就不能算报了仇。同样，若复仇者没能让对方知道是谁在报复，也不能算是报了仇。</td>
		<td class="en">THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge.You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat.At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled—but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk.I must not only punish but punish with impunity.A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser.It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不言而喻，我的一言一行丝毫没有让福图纳托怀疑我是否居心不良。我像往常一样冲他微笑，他根本没有察觉到我这次的微笑是笑里藏刀。</td>
		<td class="en">It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will.I continued, as was my in to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他有一个弱点——福图纳托这个人——虽然在其他方面他将会是一个值得尊敬甚至是敬畏的人。他对自己在品酒方面的鉴赏力颇感自豪。很少有意大利人具有真正的行家气质。大多数情况下，他们的热情都用在见机行事、见风使舵上以蒙骗那些英国和奥地利的百万富翁们。在绘画和珠宝方面，福图纳托和他的同乡们一样，是个假内行，不过对于陈年老酒，他确实在行。在这方面，我跟他没有实质性的不同——我自己对意大利葡萄酒也十分在行，一有机会就大量买进。</td>
		<td class="en">He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires.In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.In this respect I did not differ from him materially;—I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那是一个热闹的狂欢节的傍晚，当暮色降临之际我遇到了我的那位朋友。他异常亲热地招呼我，因为他已经喝了不少酒。那家伙打扮成一个小丑。他穿着一件带杂色条纹的紧身衣，头戴圆尖帽，上面系着铃铛。我看见他高兴极了，我想我从来不曾那样与他握过手。</td>
		<td class="en">It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend.He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.The man wore motley.He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我对他说：“亲爱的福图纳托，遇到你真是不胜荣幸。你今天看起来气色真好啊。我收到了一大桶所谓的白葡萄酒，可我有些怀疑。”</td>
		<td class="en">I said to him—“My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.How remarkably well you are looking to-day.But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么弄到的？”他说，“白葡萄酒，一大桶？不可能！而且还是在狂欢节期间！”</td>
		<td class="en">“How?” said he.“Amontillado, A pipe?Impossible!And in the middle of the carnival!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不太确定，”我回答，“而且我真是愚蠢至极，没有向你请教就照白葡萄酒的全价付了钱。当时找不到你，我又生怕错过了一笔买卖。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter.You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“卢切西分不出白葡萄酒和雪利酒。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可有些傻瓜说他的品酒能力和你不相上下。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我没事，走吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have no engagement;—come.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的朋友，不行。有事没事倒没什么，而是我看你正冷得够呛。地窖里潮湿得受不了。到处都结满了硝石。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My friend, no.It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted.The vaults are insufferably damp.They are encrusted with nitre.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没关系，咱们走吧。冷算不了什么。白葡萄酒！你一定上当了。至于卢切西，他分不清什么是雪利酒什么是白葡萄酒。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Let us go, nevertheless.The cold is merely nothing.Amontillado!You have been imposed upon.And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这么说着，福图纳托拉住了我的胳膊；我戴上黑绸面具，把短披风紧紧裹住身子，任由他催促着往我的府邸去了。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >家里没有一个仆人；他们早就都溜出去过节狂欢去了。我告诉过他们我要到第二天早上才能回来，并明确地命令他们不准出门。我清楚得很，这些命令足以确保我刚一转身他们立马就跑光了。</td>
		<td class="en">There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time.I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我从烛台上拿了两个火把，一个递给福图纳托，然后点头哈腰地领他穿过几套房间，走进通往地窖的拱廊。我走下一段长长的回旋楼梯，让紧跟身后的他多加小心。我们终于下完楼梯，一块儿站在蒙特雷索家地下墓窖的湿地上。</td>
		<td class="en">I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults.I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed.We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我朋友步子摇摇晃晃，每走一步他帽子上的铃铛就叮当作响。</td>
		<td class="en">The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那桶酒。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“The pipe,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还在前面，”我说，“可得留神洞穴墙壁上发光的这些白色蛛网。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is farther on,” said I; “but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他朝我转过身，用两只因醉酒像要渗出黏液的朦胧的眼睛看着我。</td>
		<td class="en">He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“硝？”他终于问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nitre?” he asked, at length.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“硝。” 我回答，“你这样咳嗽有多长时间了?”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nitre,” I replied.“How long have you had that cough?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！咳！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我可怜的朋友好几分钟都无法回答。</td>
		<td class="en">My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没什么。”他最后终于说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is nothing,” he said, at last.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来，”我毅然说道，“我们回去吧，你身体要紧。你有钱，受人尊敬，人人爱戴；你是幸福的，像我以前一样。你应该多保重。至于我，那倒无所谓。我们回去吧；你会生病的，我可负不起这个责。再说，还有卢切西——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come,” I said, with decision, “we will go back; your health is precious.You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was.You are a man to be missed.For me it is no matter.We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.Besides, there is Luchresi—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“够了，”他说，“咳嗽算不了什么，不会要了我的命。我不会咳死的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Enough,” he said; “the cough’s a mere nothing; it will not kill me.I shall not die of a cough.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对——对，”我回答，“我确实不是存心吓唬你——不过你应该尽量小心才是。喝口梅多克葡萄酒祛祛潮气吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“True—true,” I replied; “and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily—but you should use all proper caution.A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说着我从堆在模具上的一长溜酒瓶中拿出一瓶酒，敲掉了瓶颈。</td>
		<td class="en">Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喝吧。”我说着把酒递给他。</td>
		<td class="en">“Drink,” I said, presenting him the wine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他瞥了我一眼把酒举到唇边。接着他停下来，亲热地向我点点头，帽子上的铃铛也随之叮当作响。</td>
		<td class="en">He raised it to his lips with a leer.He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我为周围那些长眠于地下的死者们而喝。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我为你长命百岁而喝。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And I to your long life.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他再次挽起我的胳膊，然后我们继续向前走。</td>
		<td class="en">He again took my arm, and we proceeded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这些地窖，”他说，“真大啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“These vaults,” he said, “are extensive.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“蒙特雷索家，”我说，“是个人丁兴旺的大家族。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The Montresors,” I replied, “were a great and numerous family.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我忘了你家的家徽了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I forget your arms.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“蓝色的背景下衬着一只金色的大脚，那脚正把一条毒牙咬进脚后跟的蟒蛇踩得粉碎。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那家训呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And the motto?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“凡伤我者，必受惩罚。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nemo me impune lacessit.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好！”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Good!” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >喝了酒，他眼睛亮闪闪的。帽上的铃铛又叮呤当啷地响了。我自己的想象力也因梅多克酒而丰富了起来。我们已经穿过由尸骨、酒桶和支柱堆成的一道道墙，进入了墓窖的最深处。我又停了下来，这次居然斗胆抓住了福图纳托的上臂。</td>
		<td class="en">The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc.We had passed through long walls of piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs.I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“硝！”我说，“看，越来越多了。它就像挂在窖顶的青苔。我们在河床的下面。水珠滴在尸骨堆里。快走，我们还是趁早回去吧。你的咳嗽——”</td>
		<td class="en">“The nitre!” I said; “see, it increases.It hangs like moss upon the vaults.We are below the river’s bed.The drops of moisture trickle among the bones.Come, we will go back ere it is too late.Your cough—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没什么，”他说，“我们继续走吧。但是，先得再喝一口梅多克酒。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is nothing,” he said; “let us go on.But first, another draught of the Medoc.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我开了一壶德格拉夫的白葡萄酒递给他。他一口气喝光了。他的眼睛闪出一种可怕的光。他哈哈大笑，并用一种我不明白的手势把酒瓶往上一扔。</td>
		<td class="en">I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.He emptied it at a breath.His eyes flashed with a fierce light.He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我吃惊地看着他。他重复了那个动作——一个古怪的手势。</td>
		<td class="en">I looked at him in surprise.He repeated the movement—a grotesque one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不懂？”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You do not comprehend?” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不懂。”我答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Not I,” I replied.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你就不是同道中人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then you are not of the brotherhood.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“How?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不是共济会员。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are not of the masons.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，不，”我说，“我是，我是。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, yes,” I said; “yes, yes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你？不可能！一个共济会员？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You?Impossible!A mason?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是一个泥瓦工。”我回答。</td>
		<td class="en">“A mason,” I replied.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“暗号，”他说，“给个暗号。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A sign,” he said, “a sign.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这就是。”我边回答边从短披风的褶层下拿出一把泥刀。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is this,” I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my roquelaire a trowel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你开玩笑。”他往后倒退了几步喊道，“我们还是往前去看蒙特亚白葡萄酒吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.“But let us proceed to the Amontillado.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧。”我说，接着把泥刀重新放回披风下面，又伸过胳膊让他挽住。他重重地靠在我的胳膊上。我们继续前行寻找那桶白葡萄酒。我们穿过一连串低矮的拱道，向下，往前，再向下，最后到了一个幽深的墓穴。里面空气混浊，我们手里的火把不再有火焰，只剩下微弱的火苗。</td>
		<td class="en">“Be it so,” I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm.He leaned upon it heavily.We continued our route in search of the Amontillado.We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在墓穴的尽头出现了另一个更狭小的墓穴。其墙体成排堆着尸骨，一直高高堆到拱顶，跟巴黎大墓窟的样子类似。这个内部的墓穴里有三面墙的尸骨是这样堆着的。沿第四面墙堆放的尸骨已经被推倒，乱七八糟地堆在地上，有一处形成了一个尸骨墩。透过这面因推倒尸骨而暴露出来的墙面，我们看见里面还有一个墓穴或者说是凹洞，深约四英尺，宽三英尺，高六七英尺。这个墓穴看起来仿佛当初建造时就没派什么特殊的用场，只不过是墓窖顶下两个巨大支撑物之间的一个空隙，它的里端由一道坚硬的花岗岩石壁支撑着。</td>
		<td class="en">At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size.Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven.It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >福图纳托举起他手中昏暗的火把，尽力朝凹洞的深处仔细探视，可也是徒劳而已。微弱的光亮让我们看不清它的里端。</td>
		<td class="en">It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess.Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“往前走，”我说，“白葡萄酒就在里面。至于卢切西——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Proceed,” I said; “herein is the Amontillado.As for Luchresi—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是个笨蛋。”我的朋友打断了我，摇摇晃晃地朝前走，我则紧随其后。转眼他已走到了凹洞的尽头，发现去路被石墙挡住，他一筹莫展地站在那儿发愣。隔了片刻，我已经把他锁在了花岗岩石壁上。石壁上有两颗U形铁钉，平行相距约有两英尺远。一颗钉上挂着一条短链，另一颗则垂着一把挂锁。用铁链把他拦腰锁住，这只不过用了几秒钟就可以确保万无一失。他震惊得忘记了反抗。我拔出钥匙退出了凹洞。</td>
		<td class="en">“He is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels.In niche, and finding an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite.In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally.From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it.He was too much astounded to resist.Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“伸出你的手，”我说，“摸摸墙，你肯定能摸到硝石。是的，它非常潮湿。让我再一次请求你回去吧。不回去？那么我肯定得离开你了。但是首先我必须尽力伺候你一番。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pass your hand,” I said, “over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre.Indeed, it is very damp.Once more let me implore you to return.No?Then I must positively leave you.But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“白葡萄酒！”我的朋友惊魂未定，脱口喊道。</td>
		<td class="en">“The Amontillado!”ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不错，”我说，“白葡萄酒。”</td>
		<td class="en">“True,” I replied; “the Amontillado.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我说这些话时我已经在我之前说过的那堆尸骨间忙开了。我把尸骨都扔在一边，很快就露出了很多砌墙用的石头和灰泥。有了这些材料并凭借我的那把泥刀，我开始干劲十足地在凹洞入口处垒起墙来。</td>
		<td class="en">As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken.Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar.With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我连第一层石块还没砌好就发现福图纳托的醉意已经消失了一大半。我最初明白这一点是由于从墓穴深处传来一声低沉的呻吟。那不是一个醉汉的叫声。接着是一阵长长的、令人难耐的寂静。我砌好了第二层，接着是第三层和第四层；然后我听到了铁链被猛烈摇晃的声音。声音持续了几分钟，期间，为了听得更称心如意，我停下手中的活，在尸骨堆上坐了下来。当咣当声最终平息了下来，我才又重新拿起泥刀，一口气砌完了第五、第六和第七层。这时墙砌得差不多齐我胸高。我再次停下来，把火把举过新砌的墙，一线微弱的光亮照在里面那个身影上。</td>
		<td class="en">I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off.The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess.It was not the cry of a drunken man.There was then a long and obstinate silence.I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones.When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier.The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然，一串高声刺耳的尖叫从被铁链锁住的人的喉咙里迸发而出，仿佛要拼命让我后退。我一时间踌躇不前，浑身颤抖。随后我拔出长剑，在凹洞内四处触碰摸索；但转念一想又放下心来。我把手放在墓穴坚固的建筑结构上，觉得安心了。我重新走到墙跟前；他大声嚷嚷着，我也回应着他的尖叫。他叫一声，我跟着重复一声，我甚至还帮着他叫，叫得比他更有力。我这样一叫，大声叫嚷的他反倒渐渐平静了。</td>
		<td class="en">A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled.Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me.I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied.I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured.I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength.I did this, and the clamourer grew still.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那时已是午夜，我的活儿也接近尾声。我已经砌完了第八层，第九层和第十层。最后的第十一层也快要完工；就剩砌上最后一块石头再抹上灰泥就行了。我拼命搬起那块石头；并把它的一角搁在原定的位置。这时从凹洞里传出一阵让我毛骨悚然的低声大笑。紧接着又是一阵凄惨的声音，我好不容易才认出那声音来自高贵的福图纳托。那声音说——</td>
		<td class="en">It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.I had completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier.I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in.I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato.The voice said—</td></tr>

		<td class="en">No answer still.I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within.There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that made it so.I hastened to make an end of my labour.I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up.Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones.</td></tr>
