		<td class="en">这是一个很小的聚会，因为我们的女主人喜欢大家一起聊天。一起吃晚饭的人通常只有六个，从不超过八个。晚饭后我们前往会客厅，在那里，椅子的摆放方式不会让任何两个人有机会躲到角落里窃窃私语，从而打破一起谈话的氛围。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">他不知怎么听说了沃姆伍德·斯克拉比斯监狱需要志愿者，这引起了他的兴趣，于是他跑到内政部，见了专管监狱的官员，并提出要干这份差事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The job is unpaid, and though a number of persons are willing to undertake it, either from compassion or curiosity, they are apt to grow tired of it, or find it takes up too much time, and the prisoners whose problems, interests and future they have been concerned with are left somewhat in the lurch.</td>
		<td class="en">这份工作没有报酬，尽管很多人出于同情或好奇干了这份工作，但往往不久就由于厌烦，或是感到占用的时间太多，开始打退堂鼓。他们曾经关心的囚犯以及这些人所面临的问题、利益和未来，都被抛到了脑后。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The Home Office people consequently are wary of taking on anyone who does not look as if he would persevere, and they make careful inquiries into the applicant’s antecedents, character, and general suitability.</td>
		<td class="en">因此，内政部的官员们不会招募那些看起来不能坚持干下去的人，并会仔细询问申请人的经历、性格和适应能力。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He neither preached nor moralized.</td>
		<td class="en">他既不劝诫，也不说教。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He had never done a criminal, or even a mean, thing in his life, but he treated the crime of the prisoners he had to deal with as though it were an illness like his own tuberculosis which was a nuisance you had to put up with, but which it did no good to talk about.</td>
		<td class="en">他一生中从没犯过罪，甚至也没有做过卑劣的事情，但是他对待自己所负责的囚犯们的罪行就像对待自己的结核病一样，把它们当成是不得不忍受的烦心事，但是过多地谈论它们也没什么好处。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Wormwood Scrubs is a first offenders’ prison and it is a building, grim and cold, of forbidding appearance.</td>
		<td class="en">沃姆伍德·斯克拉比斯监狱里关的都是初次犯罪的人。那是一个晦暗又寒冷的地方，看了令人心生畏惧。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">内德的任务之一就是照顾那些刚被关进来的、觉得日子难熬的囚犯。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They were often badly shaken by their trial and sentence; and when, after the preliminary proceedings they had to go through on entering the jail, the stripping, the bath, the medical examination and the questioning, the getting into prison clothes, they were led into a cell and locked up, they were apt to break down.</td>
		<td class="en">他们常常因为审讯和宣判而受到很大的刺激。在经历入狱必经的最初程序后，其中包括脱去衣服、洗澡、体检、盘问、换上囚衣，他们会被带进一间牢房锁起来，这样一来，他们几乎都要垮掉了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Sometimes they cried hysterically; sometimes they could neither eat nor sleep.</td>
		<td class="en">有时候他们会歇斯底里地哭喊，有时候则吃不下饭也睡不着觉。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Since everyone is interested in crime it was inevitable that sooner or later, with Ned there, the conversation should turn upon it.</td>
		<td class="en">由于大家都对犯罪方面的事情感兴趣，因此只要内德在场，话题迟早会转到这方面来。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">他讲的这些故事都用以证明他经常津津乐道的一个观点：英国人普遍得到民主之前，所谓的下层阶级总是有更多的热情、更多的传奇故事、更少的顾虑；而那些富裕的或是所谓有教养的阶级却总是小心谨慎、循规蹈矩。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Because the working man doesn’t read much,’ he said, ‘because he has no great gift for expressing himself, you think he has no imagination.</td>
