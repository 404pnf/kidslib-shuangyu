		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >My memory takes me back across the interval of fifty years to a little ill-lit room with a sash window open to a starry sky, and instantly there returns to me the characteristic smell of that room, the penetrating odor of an ill-trimmed lamp, burning cheap paraffin.</td>
		<td class="en">记忆将我带回50年前一间昏暗的小房间，房间里一扇推拉窗大敞着，空对着满天繁星。我随即回忆起当时房间里特有的气味——那是一盏油灯散发出的刺鼻气味，那盏灯没什么装饰，里面燃着廉价煤油。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Lighting by electricity had then been perfected for fifteen years, but still the larger portion of the world used these lamps.</td>

		<td class="en">那就是房间夜晚的气味。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >By day it had a more subtle aroma, a closeness, a peculiar sort of faint pungency that I associate—I know not why—with dust.</td>
		<td class="en">白天它散发一股更为清淡的香气，那是一股模模糊糊的刺鼻气味，感觉很近、很特别。不知何故，我总会把这种味道与灰尘联系在一起。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Let me describe this room to you in detail.</td>
		<td class="en">让我为你详细地描绘一下这个房间吧。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was perhaps eight feet by seven in area and rather higher than either of these dimensions; the ceiling was of plaster, cracked and bulging in places, gray with the soot of the lamp, and in one place discolored by a system of yellow and olive-green stains caused by the percolation of damp from above.</td>
		<td class="en">房间长约8英尺，宽7英尺，高度较长宽来讲则更大；石膏屋顶裂纹斑斑、凹凸不平，被煤油灯的烟熏成了灰色，还有一处被天花板渗出的潮气染出了黄色与橄榄绿夹杂的印渍。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The walls were covered with dun-colored paper, upon which had been printed in oblique reiteration a crimson shape, something of the nature of a curly ostrich feather, or an acanthus flower, that had in its less faded moments a sort of dingy gaiety.</td>
		<td class="en">墙身贴着深褐色的墙纸，上面曾斜印着深红色的图案，形状有些像鸵鸟的卷毛，抑或是一种爵床科的花朵——在尚未完全凋零之前，曾经在昏暗中开得很艳。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There were several big plaster-rimmed wounds in this, caused by Parload’s ineffectual attempts to get nails into the wall, whereby there might hang pictures.</td>
		<td class="en">墙上有几大块石膏补过的地方，那是帕罗德试图在墙上钉钉子时留下的，只是钉子最终也没能钉进去，不然他可能会挂些画在上面。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >One nail had hit between two bricks and got home, and from this depended, sustained a little insecurely by frayed and knotted blind-cord, Parload’s hanging bookshelves, planks painted over with a treacly blue enamel and further decorated by a fringe of pinked American cloth insecurely fixed by tacks.</td>
		<td class="en">一颗钉子在两块砖之间落了脚，上面悬着一根窗帘绳，绳子已经磨损，打着结，摇摇晃晃地挂着帕罗德的书架。书架的板条上刷了一层黏稠的蓝色搪瓷，上面用大头钉松松垮垮地钉着彩色漆布的锯齿形流苏作为装饰。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Below this was a little table that behaved with a mulish vindictiveness to any knee that was thrust beneath it suddenly; it was covered with a cloth whose pattern of red and black had been rendered less monotonous by the accidents of Parload’s versatile ink bottle, and on it, leit motif of the whole, stood and stank the lamp.</td>
		<td class="en">书架下面是一张小桌子，那架势就像是坚持要报复突然伸到它下面的每一双膝盖；桌上蒙着一块桌布，帕罗德的多功能墨水瓶偶尔在桌上打翻过，这使桌布红黑相间的图案不再那么单调了；桌上最醒目的地方放着一盏灯，散发着恶臭。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This lamp, you must understand, was of some whitish translucent substance that was neither china nor glass, it had a shade of the same substance, a shade that did not protect the eyes of a reader in any measure, and it seemed admirably adapted to bring into pitiless prominence the fact that, after the lamp’s trimming, dust and paraffin had been smeared over its exterior with a reckless generosity.</td>
		<td class="en">你要知道，这盏灯是用一种发白的半透明的材料做成的（那种材料不是陶瓷也不是玻璃），灯罩用的也是同一种材料，起不到一点儿保护读者眼睛的作用。它似乎恰到好处，无情地突显了下述事实，即灯点燃后，灰尘和煤油会不计后果、慷慨大方地糊在灯罩外面。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The uneven floor boards of this apartment were covered with scratched enamel of chocolate hue, on which a small island of frayed carpet dimly blossomed in the dust and shadows.</td>
		<td class="en">房间的地板凹凸不平，上面巧克力色的搪瓷已经满是划痕，一小块磨旧了的地毯在灰尘和阴影里若隐若现。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There was a very small grate, made of cast-iron in one piece and painted buff, and a still smaller misfit of a cast-iron fender that confessed the gray stone of the hearth.</td>
		<td class="en">房间里有一个很小的壁炉，涂着浅黄色的漆。壁炉由一整块铸铁制成，外面是一道更小、更不相称的铸铁护栏，围着灰色的壁炉铺石。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >No fire was laid, only a few scraps of torn paper and the bowl of a broken corn-cob pipe were visible behind the bars, and in the corner and rather thrust away was an angular japanned coal-box with a damaged hinge.</td>
		<td class="en">炉里没有生火，只能看见炉栅后的几张碎纸片和一个坏了的玉米穗轴烟斗的斗。角落更深处是一个涂了亮漆、有尖角的煤箱，上面吊着一根破铰链。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was the custom in those days to warm every room separately from a separate fireplace, more prolific of dirt than heat, and the rickety sash window, the small chimney, and the loose-fitting door were expected to organize the ventilation of the room among themselves without any further direction.</td>
		<td class="en">尽管使用不同的壁炉为各个房间单独供暖的方式会产生更多的灰尘，而不是更多的暖气，但在当时却是一种惯例。无需多言，摇晃的推拉窗、小烟囱和关不严的门保证了各个房间可以多通风。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Parload’s truckle bed hid its gray sheets beneath an old patchwork counterpane on one side of the room, and veiled his boxes and suchlike oddments, and invading the two corners of the window were an old whatnot and the washhandstand, on which were distributed the simple appliances of his toilet.</td>
		<td class="en">房间一边放着帕罗德的活动矮床，床上铺着灰不溜秋的床单，床单上罩着破旧的百衲床罩，他的箱子和类似的零碎物件也都用床罩蒙着。窗户两边的角落里各放着旧的陈列架和洗漱台，上面杂乱地摆着他的几件简单的盥洗用具。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This washhandstand had been made of deal by some one with an excess of turnery appliances in a hurry, who had tried to distract attention from the rough economies of his workmanship by an arresting ornamentation of blobs and bulbs upon the joints and legs.</td>
		<td class="en">洗漱台是松木制成的，做得很匆忙，绝大部分都是用车床完成的。为了掩饰其粗糙的工艺，制作者在洗漱台的接缝和腿架上装饰着一团团的球状物。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Apparently the piece had then been placed in the hands of some person of infinite leisure equipped with a pot of ocherous paint, varnish, and a set of flexible combs.</td>
		<td class="en">很显然，这个洗漱台后来落到了某个拥有无限闲暇的人手中，他应该有一罐赭色的油漆、一罐清漆和一套折叠梳子。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This person had first painted the article, then, I fancy, smeared it with varnish, and then sat down to work with the combs to streak and comb the varnish into a weird imitation of the grain of some nightmare timber.</td>
		<td class="en">我猜想，这个人应该先给洗漱台刷了一层油漆，然后喷上清漆，之后坐下来用梳子划，在清漆层上划出某种奇怪的条纹，就像某种可怕的木材的纹理。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The washhandstand so made had evidently had a prolonged career of violent use, had been chipped, kicked, splintered, punched, stained, scorched, hammered, dessicated, damped, and defiled, had met indeed with almost every possible adventure except a conflagration or a scrubbing, until at last it had come to this high refuge of Parload’s attic to sustain the simple requirements of Parload’s personal cleanliness.</td>
		<td class="en">很显然，曾有人长期粗暴地对待这个洗漱台。它曾被削过、踢过、劈过、猛击过，曾被染污、烧焦、捶打过，曾经干燥、潮湿过，被腐蚀过，实际上，除了大火和擦洗之外，几乎各种可能的危险它都经历过了，直到它最终流落到帕罗德家的顶楼这个高级避难所，成了帕罗德维持基本的个人卫生的工具。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There were, in chief, a basin and a jug of water and a slop-pail of tin, and, further, a piece of yellow soap in a tray, a tooth-brush, a rat-tailed shaving brush, one huckaback towel, and one or two other minor articles.</td>
		<td class="en">洗漱台上的主要物品有一个脸盆、一壶水和一个锡皮污水桶，以及一块放在盒里的黄色肥皂、一把牙刷、一把鼠尾状的修面刷、一条粗麻布毛巾和一两件小物品。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >In those days only very prosperous people had more than such an equipage, and it is to be remarked that every drop of water Parload used had to be carried by an unfortunate servant girl,—the “slavey,” Parload called her—up from the basement to the top of the house and subsequently down again.</td>
		<td class="en">在那个年代，只有极为富有的人才用得起比这个还高级的物件。值得一提的是，帕罗德用的每一滴水都是由一位时运不济的女佣人（帕罗德叫她“奴隶”）从地下室提到顶楼，而后再从顶楼提下去的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Already we begin to forget how modern an invention is personal cleanliness.</td>
		<td class="en">我们已经开始忘记，讲究个人卫生是一个多么现代的发明。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It is a fact that Parload had never stripped for a swim in his life; never had a simultaneous bath all over his body since his childhood.</td>
		<td class="en">事实上，帕罗德一生中从未脱掉衣服游过泳；而且自从童年起，他从未全部脱光后从头到尾地洗过澡。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">衣柜也同样被划出奇怪的纹理。衣柜有两个大抽屉和两个小抽屉，里面放着帕罗德的换洗衣服，门后的挂钩上挂着他的两顶帽子，这些加起来就是他的“卧室兼起居室”的全部家当，这是在巨变前我就知道的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But I had forgotten—there was also a chair with a “squab” that apologized inadequately for the defects of its cane seat.</td>

		<td class="en">那时他身材高大，有一头亚麻色的头发，是个有些笨拙的年轻人，脖子和手腕不太成比例，但整个人充满了热情。他每周都抽两个晚上上夜校，去欧弗卡斯尔正规的科技学校读书。自然地理学是他最爱的“科目”，这种学习潜移默化地打开了他的思维，对外太空的好奇开始占据着他的灵魂。</td></tr>
