		<td class="en">从前有个好孩子，名字叫雅各布·布利文斯。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He always obeyed his parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath-school.</td>
		<td class="en">他总是听父母的话，无论他们的要求多么可笑、多么不近情理。他总是老老实实地读书，上主日学校也从未迟到过。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He would not play hookey, even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.</td>
		<td class="en">他从不逃学，即使冷静的判断告诉他这是他能做的最有利的事情。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely.</td>
		<td class="en">他的行为如此古怪，其他的男孩没有一个能弄明白是怎么回事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He wouldn’t lie, no matter how convenient it was.</td>
		<td class="en">他不说谎，无论撒谎能给他带来多大便利。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He just said it was wrong to lie, and that was sufficient for him.</td>
		<td class="en">他只是说，撒谎是不对的，这个理由对他来说就足够了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And he was so honest that he was simply ridiculous.</td>
		<td class="en">他是那么诚实，简直到了滑稽可笑的地步。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything.</td>
		<td class="en">雅各布古怪的行为举止真是无与伦比。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He wouldn’t play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn’t rob birds’ nests, he wouldn’t give hot pennies to organ-grinders’ monkeys; he didn’t seem to take any interest in any kind of rational amusement.</td>
		<td class="en">星期天时，他也不玩弹珠，不掏鸟窝，也不拿给街头手风琴师的猴子糖果。他似乎对任何合理的娱乐都不感兴趣。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an understanding of him, but they couldn’t arrive at any satisfactory conclusion.</td>
		<td class="en">因此，其他的男孩曾经试图推断出其中的原因，并尝试了解他，但他们没能得出任何令人满意的结论。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >As I said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was “afflicted,” and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to him.</td>
		<td class="en">正如我之前说过的，他们只能够想出一个模模糊糊的结论，那就是他“饱受折磨”，所以大家都把他置于他们的保护之下，不允许他受到任何伤害。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest delight.</td>
		<td class="en">这个好孩子读过主日学校所有的书，这些书是他最大的快乐。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This was the whole secret of it.</td>
		<td class="en">全部的秘密就在这里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He believed in the gold little boys they put in the Sunday-school book; he had every confidence in them.</td>
		<td class="en">他相信主日学校的书上所描述的那些好孩子们，也充分地信任他们。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He longed to come across one of them alive once; but he never did.</td>
		<td class="en">他曾经渴望遇到他们当中活生生的某个人，但他从来没有遇见过。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They all died before his time, maybe.</td>
		<td class="en">也许，他们在他出生之前就已经死了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and gaze on him; but it wasn’t any use; that good little boy always died in the last chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as much as a yard and a half of stuff in them.</td>
		<td class="en">每当他读到描写一个特别好的孩子的故事时，他就赶快翻到最后，看看书中的好孩子都发生了什么。因为他想跨越数千英里去仔细看看他。但是这没有任何作用，那些好孩子们总是在最后一章死去了，并且有一幅描写葬礼的插图，在那上面，他所有的亲戚和主日学校的孩子们围绕坟墓站着，穿着非常短的马裤，戴着非常大的帽子，每个人都埋在一条足有一码半长的手绢里大哭。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He was always headed off in this way.</td>
		<td class="en">他的兴致总是这样被打断了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the last chapter.</td>
		<td class="en">因为他们总是会在最后一章中死去，他便不可能看到那些好孩子们中的任何一个。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday school book.</td>
		<td class="en">雅各布有一个崇高的目标，就是被写入主日学校的书中。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He wanted to be put in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around the corner as he came from school, and welted him so over the head with a lath, and then chased him home, saying, “Hi! hi!” as he proceeded.</td>
		<td class="en">他想被写进书里，附带那些插图，描写他光荣地拒绝欺骗他的母亲，而她为此喜极而泣的情形。有的插图画着他站在门口赏给一个带着六个孩子的可怜的乞丐母亲一便士，还叫她拿去随便花，但是不要浪费，因为浪费是一种罪过。另外，还有一些插图关于他宽宏大量地拒绝去告发那个坏孩子，那孩子总在他放学回家的路上，埋伏在转角里等着他，拿一块木条板乱敲他的头，然后追赶着他直到家门口，他一边往前走着，那孩子一边嚷着：“嗨！嗨！”。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >That was the ambition of young Jacob Blivens.</td>
		<td class="en">这就是小雅各布·布利文斯的雄心壮志。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book.</td>
		<td class="en">他希望被写入主日学校的书中。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It made him feel a lithe uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died.</td>
		<td class="en">但有时候他一想到好孩子总是死去时，心里就感到有点儿不舒服。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He loved to live, you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about being a Sunday-school-book boy.</td>
		<td class="en">你知道，他是愿意活下去的，而对于成为一个主日学校的书中的好孩子，这是最令人不愉快的事情。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He knew it was not healthy to be good.</td>
		<td class="en">他知道做一个好孩子是不会有健康的身体的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He knew it was more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books were he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn’t ever see it, or even if they did get the book out before he died it wouldn’t be popular without any picture of his funeral in the back part of it.</td>
		<td class="en">他知道，要成为一个像书中那样异乎寻常地好的孩子，比害肺痨还要致命。他也知道他们中没有一个人能够坚持长久的，而一想到如果他们把他写进一本他再也看不到的书中，或者即使在他死之前的确出了那本书，却因为在书后面的部分没有他的丧礼盛况的插图而不受欢迎，他心里就非常难过。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It couldn’t be much of a Sunday-school book that couldn’t tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying.</td>
		<td class="en">如果在书里没有他临死时对社会人士作的忠告，那就算不上一本主日学校的书。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So at last, of course, he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the circumstances—to live right, and hang on as long as he could and have his dying speech all ready when his time came.</td>
		<td class="en">所以最后，当然只有下定决心在这种情形下尽可能地做到最好——循规蹈矩地生活，能坚持多久就坚持多久，并且把临死时要说的话也都预先准备好了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But somehow nothing ever went right with the good little boy; nothing ever turned out with him the way it turned out with the good little boys in the books.</td>
		<td class="en">但是不知怎么搞的，这个好孩子干什么事都不顺利，他所遭遇的事情根本就不像书中好孩子们所遭遇的那样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They always had a good time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose somewhere, and it all happened just the other way.</td>
		<td class="en">书里说他们总是过着快乐的日子，而坏孩子总是摔断了腿。但是他的情况则不知哪里不对劲了，这一切都恰好和书里说的相反。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When he found Jim Blake stealing apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out of a neighbor’s apple tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree, too, but he fell on him and broke his arm, and Jim wasn’t hurt at all.</td>
		<td class="en">当他发现吉姆·布莱克偷苹果时，他就跑到树底下念关于坏孩子从邻居家的树上掉下来摔断了胳膊的故事给他听。结果吉姆也从树上掉下来了，可是却摔在他身上，压断了他的胳膊，而吉姆却完全没有受伤。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Jacob couldn’t understand that.</td>
		<td class="en">雅各布无法理解这一点。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There wasn’t anything in the books like it.</td>
		<td class="en">书上所描述的事情可没有一件是像这样的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said he would like to catch him shoving him again, and then pretending to help him up.</td>
		<td class="en">又有一次，几个坏孩子把一位盲人推倒在泥泞中，雅各布跑过去扶他站起来，准备接受他的道谢。这位盲人非但完全不感激他，反而用拐杖重重地敲他的头，还说倒要看看他敢不敢再把他推倒又假装扶他起来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This was not in accordance with any of the books.</td>
		<td class="en">这可与任何主日学校书籍中所写的都不相符。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Jacob looked them all over to see.</td>
		<td class="en">雅各布翻遍了所有的书来看，想找出同样的例子。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn’t any place to stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that dog’s imperishable gratitude.</td>
		<td class="en">雅各布还想做一件事情，就是找到一条跛脚的、无家可归的、又饥饿又饱受摧残的狗，带回家去，把它当宝贝似的钟爱，以得到那条狗永久的感激。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him that was astonishing.</td>
		<td class="en">最后，他终于发现了一条，心里很高兴。于是他把它带回家、喂养它。可是当他想去逗这只狗玩时，它突然扑向他，撕裂了他全身的衣服，只剩下前面几块，当时的景象使他看上去显得狼狈不堪。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He examined authorities, but he could not understand the matter.</td>
		<td class="en">他仔细翻看主日学校的书籍，但他还是无法明白这是为什么。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very differently.</td>
		<td class="en">它和书里面描述的狗是属于同一品种的，但是它却表现得很不一样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Whatever this boy did he got into trouble.</td>
		<td class="en">不管这个孩子做什么，他都会招惹来麻烦。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The very things the boys in the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he could invest in.</td>
		<td class="en">书里面那些孩子获得奖励的事情，他一做起来，结果却成为对他最不利的事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off pleasuring in a sailboat.</td>
		<td class="en">有一次，在去主日学校的路上，他看到几个坏孩子驾驶着一只帆船，正开心地准备出发。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned.</td>
		<td class="en">他十分惊愕，因为他从书中知道，那些礼拜天驾船出去玩的孩子总会被淹死。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So he ran out on a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river.</td>
		<td class="en">所以他驾一只小筏去警告他们，可是他脚下一块木料动了，他跌落到河里去了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >A man got him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick abed nine weeks.</td>
		<td class="en">一个人很快把他救了起来，医生把他肚子里的水抽出来，让他的肺重新开始呼吸。可是他着凉了，在病床上躺了九个星期。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner.</td>
		<td class="en">而最不可思议的是，船里的坏孩子一整天都玩得很开心，然后安然无恙地回到了家里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Jacob Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books.</td>
		<td class="en">雅各布·布利文斯说，书里面根本没有这样的事情。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He was perfectly dumfounded.</td>
		<td class="en">他完全目瞪口呆了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying anyhow.</td>
		<td class="en">他病好之后，有点儿沮丧，但他决定无论如何一定要继续努力下去。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He knew that so far his experiences wouldn’t do to go in a book, but he hadn’t yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up.</td>
		<td class="en">他知道，到目前为止，以他的经历是不能被写入书里面的，好在他还没有达到书里面为好孩子们规定的生命期限。他希望，如果自己坚持下去，直到寿命应该完结的时候，他还是有机会上书扬名的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >If everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</td>
		<td class="en">即使每一件事情都失败了，他还可以转而依靠自己的那番临终遗言。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a cabin-boy.</td>
		<td class="en">他考察了有权威性的典籍，发现现在该去海上做一个船舱服务员的时候了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He called on a ship-captain and made his application, and when the captain asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the word, “To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher.”</td>
		<td class="en">他就去拜见一位船长，提出自己的申请。当船长要他的推荐信时，他自豪地掏出一本小册子，指着上面题的一句话，“致雅各布·布利文斯，爱他的老师赠。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, and he said, “Oh, that be blowed! that wasn’t any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he guessed he didn’t want him.”</td>
		<td class="en">但这位船长是一个粗鲁庸俗的人，他说：“噢，这他妈的有啥用！这完全不能证明他知道怎样洗碗碟或者提污水桶，我看他不行。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that ever happened to Jacob in all his life.</td>
		<td class="en">对雅各布来说，这是他整个人生中是遇到的最不可思议的一件事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship-captains, and open the way to all offices of honor and profit in their gift it never had in any book that ever he had read.</td>
		<td class="en">老师在宗教册子上的赞美，总能打动船长最仁慈的感情，使得船长在自己的权限之内给予好孩子一切可以带来荣誉和利益的职位。眼前这种事从未出现在他读过的所有的书里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He could hardly believe his senses.</td>
		<td class="en">他几乎不敢相信自己的感觉了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This boy always had a hard time of it.</td>
		<td class="en">这个孩子总是为此吃了不少苦头。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Nothing ever came out according to the authorities with him.</td>
		<td class="en">从来没有任何事情会照着他所参考的书本内容发生在他身上。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lot of them in the old iron-foundry fixing up a little joke on fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession, and were going to ornament with empty nitroglycerin cans made fast to their tails.</td>
		<td class="en">终于有一天，当他到处找寻坏孩子来劝诫时，他发现一大群坏孩子正在那个旧翻砂厂戏弄十四五条狗。他们把狗拴成一串，正打算用空的硝化甘油罐子去绑在它们的尾巴上，给它们装饰一番。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Jacob’s heart was touched.</td>
		<td class="en">雅各布的心被触动了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He sat down on one of those cans (for he never minded grease when duty was before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by the collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones.</td>
		<td class="en">他在一只铁罐上坐下来（因为在义务当前时，他并没有考虑到那是硝化甘油），他抓住最前面的狗的项圈，转过来用责备的眼神盯着邪恶的汤姆·琼斯。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But just at that moment Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in.</td>
		<td class="en">但就在这时，市议员麦克维尔特怒气冲冲地走了进来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little Sunday-school-book speeches which always commence with “Oh, sir!” in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with “Oh, sir.”</td>
		<td class="en">所有的坏孩子都跑了，可是雅各布·布利文斯却天真无邪地慢慢站起来，开始了那番庄严的、主日学校书上的短小演讲，他们总是从“哦，先生！”开始的。相反，事实上没有一个孩子，不论孩子是好是坏，说起话来会以“哦，先生！”开头。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the alderman never waited to hear the rest.</td>
		<td class="en">可是市议员永远不会等着听接下来的内容。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an instant that good little boy shot out through the roof and soared away toward the sun with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like the tail of a kite.</td>
		<td class="en">他揪住雅各布·布利文斯的耳朵，使他转过来，在他屁股上狠狠打了一巴掌。刹那间，这个好孩子冲破了屋顶，飞向了太阳，后面带着那十五条狗的碎块，像风筝的尾巴一样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And there wasn’t a sign of that alderman or that old iron-foundry left on the face of the earth; and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and how it occurred.</td>
		<td class="en">地面上再也没有了市议员或者那个旧翻砂厂的痕迹，而对于年轻的雅各布·布利文斯来说，他再也没有机会作他那费尽心血准备的临终演讲了，除非他向鸟儿们演说。因为，虽然他身体的主要部分刚好掉在了邻县的一棵树的顶上，而其他部分则分散到了四个乡镇，为此大家不得不对他进行了五次验尸，看看他究竟是否死了，以调查清楚这是怎么发生的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >You never saw a boy scattered so.</td>
		<td class="en">你永远也不会看见一个孩子这样五马分尸地死掉了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >—[This glycerin catastrophe is borrowed from a floating newspaper item, whose author’s name I would give if I knew it.—M. T.]</td>
		<td class="en">——［这次甘油灾难事件是从一个不知姓名的知情人处得知的。——马克·吐温］</td></tr>

		<td class="en">这个已经尽了全力的好孩子是这样死去的，可是他并不是按照书上所说的那样死的。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">他的情况确实不一般。</td></tr>
