		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1848年3月，亨利.大卫.梭罗（1817—1862）30岁，哈里森.G.O.布莱克（1816—1898）比梭罗大一岁。在瓦尔登湖畔居住了26个月后，梭罗于1847年9月6日离开了他在湖畔的隐居地，6个月后收到了下面这封信。梭罗在湖畔写出了他的第一本书——《在康科德河和梅里马克河上的一周》——的大部分手稿，这本书直到1849年5月才出版，同时他还写完了《瓦尔登湖》的初稿，这是他的第二本书，也是最著名的一本，这本书直到1854年8月才出版。梭罗一生中只出版过这两本书。正如梭罗在第三封信中提到的，他当时住在爱默生家中，与莉迪安.爱默生（1802—1892）作伴，同时做些家庭修补的杂事，而莉迪安的丈夫拉尔夫.瓦尔多.爱默生（1803—1882）正在英格兰讲学。写完这封信42年后，布莱克说：“也许我曾为同胞提供的最好的确切无疑的服务，如同一般意义上我们最好的服务，就是无意中在梭罗还不为人知时承认了他，如他所说，给了他‘生存的机会’，通过我的信，为他提供了一个机会……”我已经给这封信划分了段落。</td>
		<td class="en">In March 1848 Henry David Thoreau (1817—1862) was thirty years of age, Harrison Gray Otis Blake (1816—1898) a year older. After residing at Walden twenty-six months, Thoreau had left his retreat at the pond on September 6, 1847, six months before receiving this letter. While there he had written most of the manuscript for his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, which would not see publication until May 1849, and had written a complete draft of his second and most famous book, Walden, which remained unpublished until August 1854. Those were the only two books he published during his lifetime. As he mentions in Letter 3, he was at this time living in the Emerson1 household, where he kept Lidian Emerson (1802—1892) company and served as handyman while her husband Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803—1882) lectured in England. Forty-two years after writing this letter Blake remarked, “Perhaps the best definite service I ever performed for my fellow-men was, like our best services generally, the unintended one of simply recognizing Thoreau at a time when he was yet so little recognized, giving him, as he said, ‘an opportunity to live,’ making by my letters an occasion for his…” I have added the paragraph breaks to this letter.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">That reply was memorable to me. It indicated a depth of resources, a completeness of renunciation, a poise and repose in the universe, which to me is almost inconceivable; which in you seemed domesticated, and to which I look up with veneration. I would know of that soul which can say “I am nothing.” I would be roused by its words to a truer and purer life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上帝在这里的观点，我似乎渐渐明白了其中的新意；只要我们时时刻刻无比虔诚地向上帝膜拜，他的存在将充满我们的灵魂。在向上帝敞开灵魂的过程中，所有责任似乎都汇聚于中心；除此之外，我们还要做什么呢？……</td>
		<td class="en">Upon me seems to be dawning with new significance the idea that God is here; that we have but to bow before Him in profound submission at every moment, and He will fill our souls with his presence. In this opening of the soul to God, all duties seem to centre; what else have we to do? …</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果我的理解正确，你人生的意义就在于：你将从社会中抽身而出，从机构、风俗和陈规陋习的束缚中解脱出来，于是你会与上帝为伴，过上一种清新、简单的生活。你不是要向旧的形式注入新的生活，而是要过上一种里里外外全新的生活。在我看来，这种态度里包含着某些崇高的东西——尽管我自己可能离它很远……</td>
		<td class="en">If I understand rightly the significance of your life, this is it: You would sunder yourself from society, from the spell of institutions, customs, conventionalities, that you may lead a fresh, simple life with God. Instead of breathing a new life into the old forms, you would have a new life without and within. There is something sublime to me in this attitude,—far as I may be from it myself…</td></tr>

Amid a world of noisy, shallow actors it is noble to stand aside and say, “I will simply be.” Could I plant myself at once upon the truth, reducing my wants to their minimum, … I should at once be brought nearer to nature, nearer to my fellow-men,—and life would be infinitely richer.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听说我的一些话对你产生了影响，我感到很高兴, 虽然这些话是很久之前说的，我几乎不敢宣称它们出自我的口中。我感到高兴是因为这样我就有理由相信，我说出过一些人们关注的东西，而且人与人之间的对话也不是徒劳的。这就是文学的价值。然而不管怎么说，那些日子太遥远了，我不得不重新翻开那一页，才能了解我当时大概的想法。但是，仅仅因为那篇文章是你写信的契机，我也应该重视它。</td>
		<td class="en">I am glad to hear that any words of mine, though spoken so long ago that I can hardly claim identity with their author, have reached you. It gives me pleasure, because I have therefore reason to suppose that I have uttered what concerns men, and that it is not in vain that man speaks to man. This is the value of literature. Yet those days are so distant, in every sense, that I have had to look at that page again, to learn what was the tenor of my thoughts then. I should value that article, however, if only because it was the occasion of your letter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外部生活和内心生活是一致的，对此我确信无疑；如果有人会成功地过上一种更高境界的生活，其他人是无从得知的；差别和距离是同一的。开始过一种真正的生活，就是要踏上一段通往遥远国度的征程，渐渐地，我们会发现四周都是新的景致和陌生的人；只要旧事物还围绕在我身边，我就知道我并没有真正过上一种崭新的或更好的生活。外部生活只是内部生活的外显。人类本性不是隐藏于习惯下面，而是被习惯透露出来；习惯是人类真实的外衣。至于人们用何等稀奇的理由来解释他们为何遵守习惯，我并不关心。环境不是一成不变的，但我们的习惯是顽固的。我们有时容易说话含糊，似乎一种神圣的生活要嫁接到或建立在这个当前的状态上，而这个当前的状态是一个合适的基础。如果我们这样利用旧生活，这可能行得通：从旧生活中剔除我们情感中的所有温暖，然后使它腐坏，就像画眉鸟把巢建在杜鹃蛋上，把自己的蛋产在上面，然后只孵上面的蛋；但事实上，我们同时孵了两个蛋——这就是区别，而杜鹃的总是早一日孵出来，那只孵出的小杜鹃将那些小画眉挤到巢外。这是不行的，要么破坏杜鹃的蛋，要么重筑一个新巢。</td>
		<td class="en">I do believe that the outward and the inward life correspond; that if any should succeed to live a higher life, others would not know of it; that difference and distance are one. To set about living a true life is to go [on] a journey to a distant country, gradually to find ourselves surrounded by new scenes and men; and as long as the old are around me, I know that I am not in any true sense living a new or a better life. The outward is only the outside of that which is within. Men are not concealed under habits, but are revealed by them; they are their true clothes. I care not how curious a reason they may give for their abiding by them. Circumstances are not rigid and unyielding, but our habits are rigid. We are apt to speak vaguely sometimes, as if a divine life were to be grafted on to or built over this present as a suitable foundation. This might do if we could so build over our old life as to exclude from it all the warmth of our affection, and addle it, as the thrush builds over the cuckoo’s egg, and lays her own atop, and hatches that only; but the fact is, we—so there is the partition—hatch them both, and the cuckoo’s always by a day first, and that young bird crowds the young thrushes out of the nest. No. Destroy the cuckoo’s egg, or build a new nest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >改变就是改变。新生活不会占据旧躯壳；——因为旧躯壳会腐烂。新生活要新生，要成长，要繁荣。十分可悲的是，人们熟悉旧生活，欣然接受它并且保持它。如果可以去往天堂，为什么要忍受济贫院呢？这只是防止躯体腐烂——再无其他。更别提放下你的药膏和亚麻布绷带，进入一个新生儿的躯体。你在埃及的地下墓穴里看到了那个试验的结果——那就是它的终结。</td>
		<td class="en">Change is change. No new life occupies the old bodies;—they decay. It is born, and grows, and flourishes. Men very pathetically inform the old, accept and wear it. Why put it up with the almshouse when you may go to heaven? It is embalming,—no more. Let alone your ointments and your linen swathes, and go into an infant’s body. You see in the catacombs of Egypt the result of that experiment,—that is the end of it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我确实崇尚简单。即使是最聪明的人，也认为他在一天内必须处理那么多琐碎的事情；他还觉得必须省略一件杂事是不可思议的，这真让人既难过又吃惊。而数学家解决一道难题时，他会首先为方程式除去所有障碍，把它化为最简单的形式。因此，生活中的问题要简单化，要分清必要的和真实的东西。要深入地下，看看你的主根到底伸向何处。我将立足于事实。为什么不去看——用我们自己的眼睛去看呢？人类真的一无所知吗？我认识许多这样的人，他们在日常的事情上，不会受到欺骗；他们不相信空谈；他们精确地计算钱财，知道如何投资；人们说他们审慎、博学，但是他们生命的大部分时光仍然是站在桌旁，像银行的出纳员一样，发微光，生锈，最后离开。如果他们真的知道一点什么，到底为什么还要那样做？他们知道面包是什么吗？或面包是用来干什么的？他们知道生命是什么吗？如果他们知道什么，那么他们应该知道现在认识他们的地方并非会永远认识他们。</td>
		<td class="en">I do believe in simplicity. It is astonishing as well as sad, how many trivial affairs even the wisest man thinks he must attend to in a day; how singular an affair he thinks he must omit. When the mathematician would solve a difficult problem, he first frees the equation of all encumbrances, and reduces it to its simplest terms. So simplify the problem of life, distinguish the necessary and the real. Probe the earth to see where your main roots run. I would stand upon facts. Why not see,—use our eyes? Do men know nothing? I know many men who, in common things, are not to be deceived; who trust no moonshine; who count their money correctly, and know how to invest it; who are said to be prudent and knowing, who yet will stand at a desk the greater part of their lives, as cashiers in banks, and glimmer and rust and finally go out there. If they know anything, what under the sun do they do that for? Do they know what bread is? or what it is for? Do they know what life is? If they knew something, the places which know them now would know them no more forever.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">This, our respectable daily life, in which the man of common sense, the Englishman of the world, stands so squarely, and on which our institutions are founded, is in fact the veriest illusion, and will vanish like the baseless fabric of a vision; but that faint glimmer of reality which sometimes illuminates the darkness of daylight for all men, reveals something more solid and enduring than adamant, which is in fact the corner-stone of the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >事物的状态凡是人们能想象出来的，没有不能实现的。是否有人能诚实地比照自己的经历，说确实如此呢？当我们说我们的梦想不够成熟时，我们有任何事实根据吗？你听说过有人一生都忠诚和单独地向着某个目标努力，而始终不能成功的吗？如果一个人不断地追求，他能不提高吗？有没有人一直保持真诚宽宏大量，并且践行英雄主义、追求真理，最后却发现这些没有任何益处？这一切都是徒劳？当然我们并不期望我们的天堂是一个花园。我们不知道自己所求的是什么。看看文学吧——每个人的好想法如此之多！但是表达出来的却如此之少！但是我们的幻想从来不会如此微妙、缥缈，然而只有天才，再加上更大的决心和不懈的坚持，在历经千百次的失败后，才能将它用清晰的、连贯的词汇雕琢成型并表达出来，而且我们应该明白，梦想是我们知道的最可靠的事实。但是我要谈的不是梦想。</td>
		<td class="en">Men cannot conceive of a state of things so fair that it cannot be realized. Can any man honestly consult his experience and say that it is so? Have we any facts to appeal to when we say that our dreams are premature? Did you ever hear of a man who had striven all his life faithfully and singly toward an object and in no measure obtained it? If a man constantly aspires, is he not elevated? Did ever a man try heroism, magnanimity, truth, sincerity, and find that there was no advantage in them? that it was a vain endeavor? Of course we do not expect that our paradise will be a garden. We know not what we ask. To look at literature;—how many fine thoughts has every man had! how few fine thoughts are expressed! Yet we never have a fantasy so subtile and ethereal, but that talent merely, with more resolution and faithful persistency, after a thousand failures, might fix and engrave it in distinct and enduring words, and we should see that our dreams are the solidest facts that we know.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1848年5月2日，星期二；马萨诸塞州康科德信的开头引用了“我们需要面包”，这第一次清楚地表明，梭罗经常也可能总是按照布莱克选择的话题写信。换句话说，他的信应该当成对话双方的一方来理解。1848年5月2日于康科德“我们需要面包。”但什么是我们的面包呢？是面包房里的面包吗？我觉得应该就是家里自制的面包。什么是我们的肉？是肉铺里的肉吗？什么是我们必需的？我们现在通过劳动挣来的面包香甜吗？有的面包变质变酸，放入碱后却有了甜味，再经过酒精发酵、醋酸发酵，有时甚至是腐化发酵，然后放入明矾使之变白，不是这样的面包吗？这是我们必需的面包吗？的确，人类必须挥洒额头的汗水来挣自己的面包，但也要通过额头里面大脑的努力来挣面包。身体只能喂养身体。我一生中几乎没有品尝过面包。大多数面包不过是果腹的食物，滋养大脑和心灵的面包则极其罕见，即使在富人的餐桌上也绝对没有。没有一种食物适合所有人。你必须并且势必喂养那些你使用的器官。筋疲力尽的体力劳动者与耗尽脑力的学者需要的食物是不同的。人类不应该像野兽那样愚蠢地劳动，应该让大脑和身体总是或尽可能地同时工作，同时休息，这样，当身体饥饿时，大脑也会饥饿，而相同的食物将满足两者的需要；否则，身体疲累后，为身体补充能量的食物会压迫习惯于案头工作的大脑，而体能退化的学者会认为所有食物都是粗糙的，一切谋生手段都是苦差事。我们应该如何挣得面包，这是一个重大的问题，但也是一个令人愉快且引人入胜的问题。我们不要像往常那样逃避它。它是人类面对的最重要、最实际的问题。对这个问题，我们不要草率作答。我们不要满足于以某种粗俗、粗心、草率的方式获得面包。有人打猎，有人捕鱼，有人赌博，有人打仗；但他们的快乐程度都比不上认真挣取面包的人。通过诚挚的方式，全心全意、不遗余力地挣取面包的人，一定能获得面包，面包对他们来说也必定格外香甜。从真实的角度和实际的角度来说，这是毋庸置疑的，从物质的角度和精神的角度来说，这也是毋庸置疑的。一小块面包——少许面包屑就足够了，如果质量是上好的，因为好面包将提供无穷的营养。那就请每个人在去世之前，为他的身体至少挣得一片面包，然后品尝面包的味道——它与生命的面包是相同的，而且两种面包都是一口就能咽下去。我们的面包从来都不必是酸的或者是难以消化的。大自然中有益心灵的也有益于身体。她滋养了我的想象力的同时，也将滋养我的身体；因为大自然向来说话算话，并且随时准备付诸行动。大自然不仅仅有诗人眼中的美丽。彩虹和落日固然是美丽的，而人类得到食物、衣服、住所和温暖，也同样是美好的、令人欢欣鼓舞的。在人类的生命中未必有根除不了的粗俗和丑陋。我们要在生活中实事求是地努力弥补想象力察觉到的一切缺陷。天空是高远的，而我们的抱负是远大的。无论一颗树渴望长到多高，它总会在那个高度找到适合自己生长的环境。每个人都应该代表一种完全不可抗拒的力量。敢于存在的人怎么可能软弱呢？即使是最娇嫩的植物都能冲破最坚硬的土壤和岩石的缝隙向上生长，人类更是任何物质力量都不能阻挡的。一个认真的人，就是一根楔子、一把大槌、一支弹弓！有什么能阻挡他呢？一个人可能是好人，也可能是坏人；他的生活可能是真实的，也可能是虚假的；对他来说生活可能是一种耻辱，也可能是一种荣耀；这是一个重要的事实。好人会逐步完善自我；坏人则逐渐毁灭自我。但是，不管做什么，我们都要充满信心地去做（如果我们胆小，我们就按照胆小的方式去做），不期待更多的光明，但已经拥有足够的光明。如果我们充满信心地期待更多，那就让我们耐心地等待。但是我们现在拥有的是什么呢？我们不是已经等待过了吗？这是时间的开始吗？会有人无法看清前方吗，即使前方距离他站立的地方仅一寸之遥？如果一个人在路上犹豫不决，那就让他停止不前吧。让他尊重自己的疑惑，因为疑惑本身也可能包含着神性。只有一点点信念并不可悲，可悲的是对我们的信念只有一点点的忠诚。通过忠诚，我们获得信念。在生命的旅程中，如果一个人偏离了正确的预定的道路，即使偏离的角度微乎其微（而且即使在最初，这也绝不是在无意中发生的；事实上，这是他又大又红的罪恶——啊，他心里明白，但说不出来），那么他人生这出戏将变成悲剧，匆匆忙忙走向第五幕。一旦我们因此落后于自己，我们将会在途中碰到闻所未闻的障碍，在那条路上彷徨时，没有人拥有足够的智慧向我们提出忠告，没有人拥有足够的力量帮助我们。这些是责任的诅咒，因为他们忽视了自己的责任。因此才出现了十诫和其他更加复杂更加可怕的法典。这些偏离——谁没有经历过呢？——因为它们像恒星视差一样微小，开始时我们说它们什么都不是，换句话说，它们从虚无中产生于灵魂的一种休眠和遗忘状态。人要慎之又慎才不会偏离正道，一定要高瞻远瞩，这样才能认清自己真正的道路。</td>
		<td class="en">May 2, 1848, Tuesday; Concord, MassachusettsThe quotation beginning this letter—“We must have our bread”—is the first clear indication that Thoreau often and perhaps usually wrote on topics of Blake’s choosing. In other words, his letters should be understood as one side of what was actually a dialogue between the two men.Concord, May 2, 1848.“We must have our bread.” But what is our bread? Is it baker’s bread? Methinks it should be very home-made bread. What is our meat? Is it butcher’s meat? What is that which we must have? Is that bread which we are now earning sweet? Is it not bread which has been suffered to sour, and then been sweetened with an alkali, which has undergone the vinous, acetous, and sometimes the putrid fermentation, and then been whitened with vitriol? Is this the bread which we must have? Man must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, truly, but also by the sweat of his brain within his brow. The body can feed the body only. I have tasted but little bread in my life. It has been mere grub and provender for the most part. Of bread that nourished the brain and the heart, scarcely any. There is absolutely none even on the tables of the rich.There is not one kind of food for all men. You must and you will feed those faculties which you exercise. The laborer whose body is weary does not require the same food with the scholar whose brain is weary. Men should not labor foolishly like brutes, but the brain and the body should always, or as much as possible, work and rest together, and then the work will be of such a kind that when the body is hungry the brain will be hungry also, and the same food will suffice for both; otherwise the food which repairs the waste energy of the overwrought body will oppress the sedentary brain, and the degenerate scholar will come to esteem all food vulgar, and all getting a living drudgery.How shall we earn our bread is a grave question; yet it is a sweet and inviting question. Let us not shirk it, as is usually done. It is the most important and practical question which is put to man. Let us not answer it hastily. Let us not be content to get our bread in some gross, careless, and hasty manner. Some men go a-hunting, some a-fishing, some a-gaming, some to war; but none have so pleasant a time as they who in earnest seek to earn their bread. It is true actually as it is true really; it is true materially as it is true spiritually, that they who seek honestly and sincerely, with all their hearts and lives and strength, to earn their bread, do earn it, and it is sure to be very sweet to them. Avery little bread,—a very few crumbs are enough, if it be of the right quality, for it is infinitely nutritious. Let each man, then, earn at least a crumb of bread for his body before he dies, and know the taste of it,—that it is identical with the bread of life 1, and that they both go down at one swallow.Our bread need not ever be sour or hard to digest. What Nature is to the mind she is also to the body. As she feeds my imagination, she will feed my body; for what she says she means, and is ready to do. She is not simply beautiful to the poet’s eye. Not only the rainbow and sunset are beautiful, but to be fed and clothed, sheltered and warmed aright, are equally beautiful and inspiring. There is not necessarily any gross and ugly fact which may not be eradicated from the life of man. We should endeavor practically in our lives to correct all the defects which our imagination detects. The heavens are as deep as our aspirations are high. So high as a tree aspires to grow, so high it will find an atmosphere suited to it. Every man should stand for a force which is perfectly irresistible. How can any man be weak who dares to be at all? Even the tenderest plants force their way up through the hardest earth, and the crevices of rocks; but a man no material power can resist. What a wedge, what a beetle, what a catapult, is an earnest man! What can resist him?It is a momentous fact that a man may be good, or he may be bad; his life may be true, or it may be false; it may be either a shame or a glory to him. The good man builds himself up; the bad man destroys himself.But whatever we do we must do confidently (if we are timid, let us, then, act timidly), not expecting more 1ight, but having light enough. If we confidently expect more, then let us wait for it. But what is this which we have? Have we not already waited? Is this the beginning of time? Is there a man who does not see clearly beyond, though only a hair’s breadth beyond where he at any time stands?If one hesitates in his path, let him not proceed. Let him respect his doubts, for doubts, too, may have some divinity in them. That we have but little faith is not sad, but that we have but little faithfulness. By faithfulness faith is earned. When, in the progress of a life, a man swerves, though only by an angle infinitely small, from his proper and allotted path (and this is never done quite unconsciously even at first; in fact, that was his broad and scarlet sin2,—ah, he knew of it more than he can tell), then the drama of his life turns to tragedy, and makes haste to its fifth act3. When once we thus fall behind ourselves, there is no accounting for the obstacles which rise up in our path, and no one is so wise as to advise, and no one so powerful as to aid us while we abide on that ground. Such are cursed with duties, and the neglect of their duties. For such the decalogue was made, and other far more voluminous and terrible codes.These departures,—who have not made them?—for they are as faint as the parallax of a fixed star, and at the commencement we say they are nothing,—that is, they originate in a kind of sleep and forget fullness of the soul when it is naught. A man cannot be too circumspect in order to keep in the straight road, and be sure that he sees all that he may at any time see, that so he may distinguish his true path.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">April 17, 1849, Tuesday; Concord, MassachusettsDuring the preceding five months Thoreau had on six occasions delivered one or another of his three Walden lectures in Portland, Maine, and in the Massachusetts towns of Concord, Lincoln, Salem, and Gloucester. Blake had probably arranged for him to deliver all three Walden lectures in Worcester on three successive Friday evenings at 7:30 p.m., the first in City Hall on April 20, the other two in Brinley Hall on April 27 and May 3. The previous month Thoreau contracted with James Munroe and Company of Boston to publish A Week at his own expense, with Walden to be published shortly afterward. He had also agreed to write up his February 1848 lecture on “Resistance to Civil Government” (later retitled “Civil Disobedience”) for publication in May. So during this time he was extremely busy preparing his manuscripts and correcting proofs. His older sister Helen was also struggling through a final bout with tuberculosis at this time. She succumbed to the disease on June14. Thoreau rode the Fitchburg Railroad fifteen miles northwest to Groton, Massachusetts, where he changed to the Worcester & Nashua Railroad. The mention of Emerson is explained by the fact that Emerson traveled extensively as a professional lecturer and was therefore very familiar with railroad schedules and routes.Concord Apr. 17th 1849</td></tr>

But the commercial failure of A Week, perhaps not yet apparent in early August, was to delay Walden’s appearance until August 1854.Concord, August 10, 1849Mr. Blake,—I write now chiefly to say, before it is too late, that I shall be glad to see you in Concord, and will give you a chamber, etc., in my father’s house, and as much of my poor company as you can bear.I am in too great haste this time to speak to your, or out of my, condition. I might say,—you might say,—comparatively speaking, be not anxious to avoid poverty. In this way the wealth of the universe may be securely invested. What a pity if we do not live this short time according to the laws of the long time,—the eternal laws! Let us see that we stand erect here, and do not lie along by our whole length in the dirt. Let our meanness be our footstool, not our cushion. In the midst of this labyrinth let us live a thread1 of life. We must act with so rapid and resistless a purpose in one direction, that our vices will necessarily trail behind. The nucleus of a comet is almost a star. Was there ever a genuine dilemma? The laws of earth are for the feet, or inferior man; the laws of heaven are for the head, or superior man; the latter are the former sublimed and expanded, even as radii from the earth’s centre go on diverging into space.

		<td class="en">This fall and winter was an incredibly busy and important time for Thoreau. As he mentions in this letter, he had established a productive routine of reading and writing during mornings and evenings with along walk in the afternoon. But that routine must have been regularly disrupted as a consequence of the commercial failure of A Week, which by November was a settled fact and which left Thoreau with a debt of almost three hundred dollars—about a year’s wages for the average working male at the time. To begin paying off his debt (it was not fully paid until late 1853) he worked long hours in his family’s pencil factory and peddled finished pencils as well. Although he seriously considered speculating in cranberries, he dropped that scheme when he found that it would not pay. Instead, he announced his services as a professional surveyor. He had purchased surveying equipment years before, when teaching with his older brother John (1814—1842), in order to give his students a practical application of mathematics, and he had used the equipment while at Walden to produce a highly detailed survey of the pond. He had even done a small surveying job for Emerson in May 1849. But now he purchased a surveyor’s handbook and took on two large surveying jobs, one of which lasted throughout the winter. The previous month he and William Ellery Channing (1817—1901) had gone on a five-day excursion to Cape Cod, and he immediately began drafting a lecture based on the trip, completing a draft by December. In September he had requested and received borrowing privileges at the Harvard College Library. He used those privileges to begin researching early New England history, in part to supplement his Cape Cod lectures. In 1843 he had conducted research on graphite, the principal ingredient used to make pencils, and had dramatically improved the graphite-grinding machinery in the family’s mill. As a result of his ingenuity, the family business by 1849 had effected a transition from the manufacture of pencils to supplying powdered graphite to electrotypers, a transition which resulted in sufficient prosperity for the family to purchase a commodious house on Main Street in Concord. Although they purchased the house in November 1849, repairs and improvements delayed the move for a year. Finally, during this difficult period Thoreau’s relationship with Emerson degenerated badly. Emerson had encouraged Thoreau to publish A Week at his own expense but had criticized the book after it was published. Naturally, Thoreau felt betrayed by his erstwhile mentor, and although they continued to be on fairly good terms, their friendship never fully recovered.</td></tr>

He taught in Milton with Christopher A.

Are we well acquainted, then, with the reality? There is none who does not lie hourly in the respect he pays to false appearance. How sweet it would be to treat men and things, for an hour, for just what they are! We wonder that the sinner does not confess his sin. When we are weary with travel, we lay down our load and rest by the wayside. So, when we are weary with the burden of life, why do we not lay down this load of falsehoods which we have volunteered to sustain, and be refreshed as never mortal was? Let the beautiful laws prevail. Let us not weary ourselves by resisting them. When we would rest our bodies we cease to support them; we recline on the lap of earth. So, when we would rest our spirits, we must recline on the Great Spirit1. Let things alone; let them weigh what they will; let them soar or fall.

		<td class="en">May 28, 1850, Tuesday; Concord, MassachusettsConcord May 28 1850Mr. Blake,I “never found any contentment in the life which the newspapers record”—any thing of more value than the cent which they cost. Contentment in being covered with dust an inch deep! We who walk the streets and hold time together, are but the refuse of ourselves,and that life is for the shells of us—of our body & our mind—for our scurf—a thoroughly scurvy life. It is coffee made of coffee-grounds the twentieth time, which was only coffee the first time—while the living water leaps and sparkles by our doors. I know some who in their charity give their coffee-grounds to the poor! We demanding news, and putting up with such news! Is it a new convenience or a new accident or rather a new perception of the truth that we want?You say that “the serene hours in which Friendship, Books, Nature, Thought, seem above primary considerations, visit you but faintly”—Is not the attitude of expectation somewhat divine?—a sort of homemade divineness? Does it not compel a kind of sphere music to attend on it? And do not its satisfactions merge at length by insensible degrees in the enjoyment of the thing expected?What if I should forget to write about my not writing. It is not worth the while to make that a theme. It is as if I had written every day—It is as if I had never written before—I wonder that you think so much about it, for not writing is the most like writing in my case of anything I know.Why will you not relate to me your dream? That would be to realize it somewhat. You tell me that you dream, but not what you dream.—I can guess what comes to pass. So do the frogs dream.1 Would that I knew what. I have never found out whether they are awake or asleep—whether it is day or night with them.I am preaching, mind you, to bare walls, that is to myself; and if you have chanced to come in and occupy a pew—do not think that my remarks are directed at you particularly, and so slam the seat in disgust.

		<td class="en">August 9, 1850, Friday; Concord, MassachusettsProbably to supplement his lectures, Thoreau had visited Cape Cod again in late June, this time alone. He described the ocean in his lectures as a “vast morgue,” an association that was doubtless heightened when, at Emerson’s request, he left Concord on July 23 to search for the remains and personal effects of the well-known author Margaret Fuller (1810—1850), who with her husband, Giovanni Angelo, the Marquis of Ossoli (d. 1850), and their young son, Angelo (1848—1850), had perished in a shipwreck on July 19 off the coast of Fire Island, a barrier island off Long Island. The bodies of Fuller and Ossoli were never recovered. By the time Thoreau arrived, Angelo had already been buried and the ship’s wreckage had been plundered, so his search was largely fruitless. He returned to Concord on July 29. Late in August the Thoreau family moved to the newly remodeled house on Main Street, where Thoreau occupied the third-floor attic. He continued, for the most part, to ignore his Walden manuscript. Although one scholar believes that Blake moved from Milton back to Worcester between July 22 and August 11, the fact that Blake’s colleague in Milton, Christopher Greene, hand-carried this letter to Blake suggests that the move did not take place until a somewhat later date.H. G. O. BlakeCare of Mr. C. A. GreeneMilton Mass.Concord Aug. 9th 1850Mr Blake,I received your letter just as I was rushing to Fire Island Beach to recover what remained of Margaret Fuller and read it on the way. That event and its train, as much as anything, have prevented my answering it before. It is wisest to speak when you are spoken to. I will now endeavor to reply at the risk of having nothing to say.I find that actual events, notwithstanding the singular prominence which we all allow them, are far less real than the creations of my imagination. They are truly visionary and insignificant—all that we commonly call life & death—and affect me less than my dreams. This petty stream which from time to time swells & carries away the mills and bridges of our habitual life—and that mightier stream or ocean on which we securely float—what makes the difference between them? I have in my pocket a button which I ripped off the coat of the Marquis of Ossoli on the sea-shore the other day. Held up it intercepts the light—an actual button—and yet all the life it is connected with is less substantial to me, and interests me less, than my faintest dream.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1852 年7 月21 日，星期三；马萨诸塞州康科德梭罗的上一封信写于两年前，这两年以来发生了很多事。1850 年秋天，他和钱宁一起前往蒙特利尔和魁北克，梭罗详细描写了这次旅行，并于1851 年就此发表了演讲，从上一封信以来，梭罗共发表了十四次演讲，这是其中的一次。当时的南北冲突已经很激烈，这种冲突在不到十年的时间内就会造成国家分裂，而《1850 年妥协案》的通过，使得南北冲突急剧地加剧，其中最有争议的部分是《逃奴法》。这个总括性法案的这一部分规定联邦政府必须竭力协助追捕逃亡奴隶，法案中的条款允许联邦政府将任何人强行从某州境内带走，这就侵害了各州的主权，因此当时的美国人对该法案颇为怀疑。1851 年4 月，安东尼. 西姆斯从波士顿被引渡，这引发了北方人的愤怒，使许多北方人加入了反对奴隶制度的行列。梭罗自己也作出了回应，他积极地参与到“地下铁路”运动中，庇护逃跑的奴隶，帮助他们逃往加拿大。他于1851 年4 月发表了题为《散步》的演讲，这是最早的版本，一开始就对《逃奴法》提出了尖锐的批评。在这次演讲中，梭罗首次提出了“荒野中蕴藏着世界”，这可能是他最著名的论断。后来他可能发现，他将这次演讲作为“我今后写的所有东西的引言”，这指的是他之后进行的大型自然史项目，他在这十年中的后几年开始研究自然史，并且一直持续工作到生命结束。下个月底，即1851 年5 月末，梭罗装上假牙之后到伍斯特发表演讲，在那里停留了三天，拜访了布莱克、布朗以及他在伍斯特的其他朋友。这段时间，测量事业让他变得比他所希望的更繁忙，尽管他还是需要资金来偿还出版《在康科德河和梅里马克河上的一周》欠下的债务。1851 年年末，他终于回到修改《瓦尔登湖》手稿的工作上，此后修改工作一直持续，直到1854 年8 月此书出版。大约从1850 年秋天开始，梭罗投入大量精力学习植物学，更加系统地研究家乡的树木和田野。写这封信的时候，他正对季节的变化尤其感兴趣，并在进行更细心的追踪观察，这封信的第一个注释会提到这点。布莱克于1851年秋天在波士顿教书，可能一直教到1852 年春天，现在，他又回到了伍斯特。1852 年7 月21 日于康科德布莱克先生：我这些天过得太过无聊，以至于没有什么值得给你写信的。我的生活几乎完全成了外在的，整个都是坚硬的果壳，而没有柔嫩的果仁；因此我担心我叙述的生活对你来说只是一枚坚果，砸开它，里面却没有果肉可以供你吃。此外，你没有催我回信，因此对于何时回信，我很愉快地享受着如此大的自由，觉得自己像空气一样飘忽。不过，我高兴地得知，你以极大的耐心聆听了之前我所说的任何事情，并且发现了其中所有的真理。这鼓励我想多谈一些——但恐怕不是在这封信里——而是在将来我可能写的某本书中。知道自己对世人有贡献，这让我很高兴，就像坚持不懈、始终如一的稻草人对农民的贡献一样——我就如那一捆稻草，披着人类的外衣——身上晃荡着的几片马口铁在太阳下闪闪发光。好像我正在田间辛苦工作。但是，如果这种生活能拯救任何人的玉米——但他是得利者。既然你了解我的为人，知道我的想法和目标，并且能将两者区分开来，我就不担心你会奉承我，因为一般情况下，如果你赞美后者，就会谴责前者。我清晰地记得那次到阿斯尼伯姆斯基特的徒步之旅，那是一个适合星期日去的地方，是大地上真正的庙宇之一。你知道，在古代，庙宇是“没有穹顶的空旷地”，四围的墙壁只是要将世界挡在庙宇外面，指引精神升向天堂；但是现代的会堂则将天堂挡在门外，把世界塞进更加拥挤的空间。在我看来，山顶是最好的去处，无遮无拦，能得到自我提升，脚下还有以太环绕。蔓虎刺吸收了山上露水的精华，在那里茂盛地生长，这至少比我上次从牧师那听来的话更令我难忘，就我来说，我更愿意朝向拉特兰步行，而不是耶路撒冷。拉特兰是一座现代小镇，布满了车辙的土地，平凡而破旧，它不是那么神圣，也没有圣墓，但是有碧绿而实在的田野和积满尘土的道路——在这里你有机会过着一种尽可能神圣的生活；——在这里如果神圣存在，也只存在于你自己身上，与地方无关。我担心你们伍斯特人不常攀上山顶，虽然我听说你们山上的泉水比山谷的泉水离地表更近。他们被誉为“自由占地者”——他们是否也坚持拥有自由的空气，即坚持拥有头脑或思想以及双脚的自由呢？如果我有意加入某个党派，我会选择思想最自由的党派。现在全世界的人都在抱怨，说他们琐事缠身，没有时间和精力经营他们所知道的更高境界的生活——但是毋庸置疑，如果他们天生合适高尚生活，假定他们又能从一切琐事中解脱——那么他们即刻就能成就高尚的事业，从而忽略其他一切无足轻重的东西，这会像呼吸一样自然。他们再也不会抱怨自己没有时间进行高尚的追求，因为即使最呆笨的人也知道他要做的只有这件事。那些出于责任感而行动的人，绝不会把次要责任放在首要责任之上。那些渴望并有能力从事高尚事业的人，未必会有能力为自己搭建通往高处的平台。至于是否经历过伟大而又辉煌的体验，并且在体验中自我提升——就像雄鹰飞过夜空，冲向更光明、更晴朗的天空一样，我不敢说自己曾经有过如此光荣的航行，只是我的航船曾经似乎受到侧风的干扰，消失在海的边缘，现在只是偶尔才会重新驶回那片大海的中心。我还没有超越任何美好的东西，但我敢坦言，美德的整块大陆还在我的前方，它们本应该像我旅程中的小岛，被一一超越；不过我相信——我还能相信什么呢？——当某个星期五刮起强风时，我抛掉了船上的某些货物后，就可能补回我落下的所有的里程。</td>
		<td class="en">July 21, 1852, Wednesday; Concord, MassachusettsA great deal had occurred in the two years since Thoreau’s last letter. He and Channing had traveled to Montreal and Quebec in the fall of 1850, an excursion which Thoreau wrote up and lectured on in December 1851, one of fourteen lectures he had delivered since his last letter. The sectional strife that would tear the country apart in less than a decade accelerated dramatically with the passage of the Compromise of 1850, the most contentious part of which was the Fugitive Slave Law. This component of the omnibus bill mandated federal resources for the remanding of escaped slaves, but Americans at this time were highly skeptical of provisions allowing the federal government to infringe upon a state’s sovereignty by forcibly removing anyone from within the state’s borders. The April 1851 rendition of Anthony Sims from Boston ignited the wrath of Northerners, driving many into antislavery ranks. Thoreau himself responded by stepping up his participation in the Underground Railroad, sheltering escaped slaves and helping them on their way to Canada. He delivered the earliest version of his “Walking” lecture in April 1851, prefacing the lecture with a caustic remark about the Fugitive Slave Law. In this lecture he first uttered what may be his most famous proclamation, “[I]n Wildness is the preservation of the world.” Later he would note that he regarded this lecture as “a sort of introduction to all I may write hereafter,” a reference to the large natural history projects he would take up later in the decade and would continue working on for the remainder of his life. At the end of the following month, May 1851, after being fitted with false teeth, he delivered the lecture in Worcester, staying on three days to visit with Blake, Brown, and his other Worcester friends. His surveying business had been keeping him busier than he wished, although he continued toneed the money to pay down his debt for A Week. Late in 1851 he finally got back to work on his Walden manuscript and would continue to steadily refine it until publication in August 1854. Since the fall of 1850 or so he had been putting considerable effort into learning botany, and studying the woods and fields of his hometown more systematically. At the time of this letter he was particularly interested in tracking the seasons more carefully, as the first note for this letter indicates. Blake was by this time once again back in Worcester after having taught in Boston during the fall of 1851 and perhaps into the spring of 1852.Concord July 21st ’52.Mr. Blake,I am too stupidly well these days to write to you. My life is almost altogether outward, all shell and no tender kernel; so that I fear the report of it would be only a nut for you to crack, with no meat in it for you to eat. Moreover, you have not cornered me up, and I enjoy such large liberty in writing to you that I feel as vague as the air. However, I rejoice to hear that you have attended so patiently to anything which I have said heretofore, and have detected any truths in it. It encourages me to say more—not in this letter I fear—but in some book which I may write one day. I am glad to know that I am as much to any mortal as a persistent and consistent scarecrow is to a farmer—such a bundle of straw in a man’s clothing as I am—with a few bits of tin1 to sparkle in the sun dangling about me. As if I were hard at work there in the field. However, if this kind of life saves any man’s corn,—why he is the gainer. I am not afraid that you will f latter me as long as you know what I am, as well as what I think, or aim to be, & distinguish between these two, for then it will commonly happen that if you praise the last, you will condemn the first.I remember that walk to Asnebumskit2 very well;—a fit place to go on a Sunday, one of the true temples of the earth. A temple you know was anciently “an open place without a roof,” whose walls served merely to shut out the world, and direct the mind toward heaven; but a modern meeting house shuts out the heavens, while it crowds the world into still closer quarters. Best of all is it when as on a Mt. top you have for all walls your own elevations and deeps of surrounding ether3. The partridge berries watered with Mt. dews, which are gathered there, are more memorable to me than the words which I last heard from the pulpit at least, and for my part I would rather walk toward Rutland4 than Jerusalem. Rutland—modern town—land of ruts—trivial and worn—not too sacred—with no holy sepulchre, but prophane green fields and dusty roads,—and opportunity to live as holy a life as you can;—where the sacredness if there is any is all in yourself and not in the place.I fear that your Worcester people do not often enough go to the hilltops, though, as I am told, the springs lie nearer to the surface on your hills than in your valleys. They have the reputation of being Free Soilers5—Do they insist on a free atmosphere too, that is, on freedom for the head or brain as well as the feet? If I were consciously to join any party it would be that which is the most free to entertain thought.All the world complain nowadays of a press of trivial duties & engagements which prevents their employing themselves on some higher ground they know of,—but undoubtedly if they were made of the right stuff to work on that higher ground, provided they were released from all those engagements—they would now at once fulfill the superior engagement, and neglect all the rest, as naturally as they breathe. They would never be caught saying that they had no time for this when the dullest man knows that this is all that he has time for. No man who acts from a sense of duty ever puts the lesser duty above the greater. No man has the desire and the ability to work on high things but he has also the ability to build himself a high staging.As for passing through any great and glorious experience, and rising above it,—as an eagle might fly athwart the evening sky to rise into still brighter & fairer regions of the heavens, I cannot say that I ever sailed so creditably, but my bark ever seemed thwarted by some side wind and went off over the edge and now only occasionally tacks back toward the center of that sea again. I have outgrown nothing good, but, I do not fear to say, fallen behind by whole continents of virtue which should have been passed as islands in my course; but I trust—what else can I trust?—that with a stiff wind some Friday, when I have thrown some of my cargo over board, I may make up for all that distance lost.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">September 1852; Concord, MassachusettsIn July 1852, Blake and one of his longtime students, Nancy Pope Howe Conant (1829—1872) decided they would marry during the forthcoming autumn. At thirty-six years of age, Blake had been a widower and single parent for six years. His fiancée was thirteen years his junior and from a wealthy family in Sterling, a small town twelve miles north of downtown Worcester. The couple married at a Unitarian church in Sterling on October 27, 1852. The marriage brought Blake financial security—a Worcester newspaper two years later reported that he paid tax on $20,590, whereas before he had been struggling to make ends meet—but more importantly it allied him to a woman who seems to have been as high-minded as he was. In late August 1852 he wrote to both Thoreau and Amos Bronson Alcott asking them, as he wrote in his letter to Alcott, how they thought a man and a woman could “help each other to be more truly solitary in the good & beautiful sense, to be more truly free, to be nearer the common Friend that we could be, apart? For we aim, I think, at nothing less than that. How shall we treat each other, with what reserve, with what Holy Reverence, so that the Mystery, the Poetry, & Beauty which hang about the dawning of love, may not be changed by too close an intercourse, by sharing, in common, the cares of daily life, into a prosaic & vulgar familiarity.” His letter makes clear that he had conferred with his fiancée on these matters. Clearly, then, the high moral purpose of marital union was suggested by Blake and his fiancée just as much as it was assumed by Thoreau. Although Thoreau’s cover letter for the two enclosures is undated, he would probably have needed two or three weeks to gather the “disconnected fragments” on “Love” and “Chastity and Sensuality” from his journal. Probably he sent them during September 1852.

		<td class="en">April 10, 1853, Sunday; Concord, MassachusettsConcord, April 10, 1853.Mr. Blake,—Another singular kind of spiritual foot-ball,—really nameless, handleless, homeless, like myself,—a mere arena for thoughts and feelings; definite enough outwardly, indefinite more than enough inwardly. But I do not know why we should be styled “misters” or “masters”: we come so near to being anything or nothing, and seeing that we are mastered, and not wholly sorry to be mastered, by the least phenomenon. It seems to me that we are the mere creatures of thought,—one of the lowest forms of intellectual life, we men,—as the sunfish is of animal life. As yet our thoughts have acquired no definiteness nor solidity; they are purely molluscous, not vertebrate; and the height of our existence is to float upward in an ocean where the sun shines,—appearing only like a vast soup or chowder to the eyes of the immortal navigators. It is wonderful that I can be here, and you there, and that we can correspond, and do many other things, when, in fact, there is so little of us, either or both, anywhere. In a few minutes, I expect, this slight film or clash of vapor that I am will be what is called asleep,—resting! forsooth from what? Hard work? and thought? The hard work of the dandelion down, which floats over the meadow all day; the hard work of a pismire that labors to raise a hillock all day, and even by moonlight. Suddenly I can come forward into the utmost apparent distinctness, and speak with a sort of emphasis to you; and the next moment I am so faint an entity, and make so slight an impression, that nobody can find the traces of me. I try to hunt myself up, and find the little of me that is discoverable is falling asleep, and then I assist and tuck it up. It is getting late. How can I starve or feed? Can I be said to sleep? There is not enough of me even for that. If you hear a noise,—’t aint I, —’t aint I,—as the dog says with a tin-kettle tied to his tail.1I read of something happening to another the other day: how happens it that nothing ever happens to me? A dandelion down that never alights, —settles,—blown off by a boy to see if his mother wanted him2,—some divine boy in the upper pastures.Well, if there really is another such a meteor sojourning in these spaces, I would like to ask you if you know whose estate this is that we are on? For my part I enjoy it well enough, what with the wild apples and the scenery; but I shouldn’t wonder if the owner set his dog on me next. I could remember something not much to the purpose, probably; but if I stick to what I do know, then—It is worth the while to live respectably unto ourselves. We can possibly get along with a neighbor, even with a bedfellow, whom we respect but very little; but as soon as it comes to this, that we do not respect ourselves, then we do not get along at all, no matter how much money we are paid for halting. There are old heads in the world who cannot help me by their example or advice to live worthily and satisfactorily to myself; but I believe that it is in my power to elevate myself this very hour above the common level of my life. It is better to have your head in the clouds, and know where you are, if indeed you cannot get it above them, than to breathe the clearer atmosphere below them, and think that you are in paradise.Once you were in Milton doubting what to do. To live a better life—this surely can be done. Dot and carry one. Wait not for a clear sight, for that you are to get. What you see clearly you may omit to do. Milton and Worcester? It is all Blake, Blake. Never mind the rats in the wall; the cat will take care of them. All that men have said or are is a very faint rumor, and it is not worth the while to remember or refer to that. If you are to meet God, will you refer to anybody out of that court? How shall men know how I succeed, unless they are in at the life? I did not see the “Times” reporter there.Is it not delightful to provide one’s self with the necessaries of life,—to collect dry wood for the fire when the weather grows cool, or fruits when we grow hungry?—not till then. And then we have all the time left for thought!Of what use were it, pray, to get a little wood to burn, to warm your body this cold weather, if there were not a divine fire kindled at the same time to warm your spirit?“Unless above himself he can</td></tr>

		<td class="en">December l9 and 22, 1853, Monday and Thursday;Concord, MassachusettsIn September Thoreau had made his second trip into the Maine woods, where he was accompanied by his cousin George Thatcher and the Indian guide Joseph Aitteon. He quickly wrote the excursion up as a lecture and delivered it before his townsmen on December 14. An expanded version of this lecture is the second chapter, “Chesuncook,” in his posthumously published book The Maine Woods. At the end of October he received the 706 unsold copies of A Week (of 1,000 printed),the debt for which he had still not quite paid. Having carried them up two flights of stairs to his attic apartment and observed their vast bulk, he remarked wryly in his journal, “I now have a library of nearly nine hundred volumes, over seven hundred of which I wrote myself.” An entry in Emerson’s journal of this period appears to relate to this particular letter: “H. D. T charged Blake, if he could not do hard tasks, to take the soft ones, & when he liked anything, if it was only a picture or a tune, to stay by it, find out what he liked, & draw that sense or meaning out of it, & do that: harden it, somehow, & make it his own. Blake thought & thought on this, & wrote afterwards to Henry, that he had got his first glimpse of heaven.” Emerson later added the remark, “Henry was a good physician.”Concord, December 19, 1853.Mr. Blake,—My debt has accumulated so that I should have answered your last letter at once, if I had not been the subject of what is called a press of engagements, having a lecture to write for last Wednesday, and surveying more than usual besides. It has been a kind of running fight with me,—the enemy not always behind me, I trust.True, a man cannot lift himself by his own waistbands, because he cannot get out of himself; but he can expand himself (which is better, there being no up nor down in nature), and so split his waistbands, being already within himself.You speak of doing and being, and the vanity, real or apparent, of much doing. The suckers—I think it is they—make nests in our river in the spring of more than a cart-load of small stones, amid which to deposit their ova. The other day I opened a muskrat’s house. It was made of weeds, five feet broad at base, and three feet high, and far and low within it was a little cavity, only a foot in diameter, where the rat dwelt. It may seem trivial, this piling up of weeds, but so the race of muskrats is preserved. We must heap up a great pile of doing, for a small diameter of being. Is it not imperative on us that we do something, if we only work in a treadmill? And, indeed, some sort of revolving is necessary to produce a center and nucleus of being. What exercise is to the body, employment is to the mind and morals. Consider what an amount of drudgery must be performed,—how much humdrum and prosaic labor goes to any work of the least value. There are so many layers of mere white lime in every shell to that thin inner one so beautifully tinted. Let not the shell-fish think to build his house of that alone; and pray, what are its tints to him? Is it not his smooth close-fitting shirt merely, whose tints are not to him, being in the dark, but only when he is gone or dead, and his shell is heaved up to light, a wreck upon the beach, do they appear. With him, too, it is a Song of the Shirt, “Work,—work,—work!”1 And the work is not merely a police in the gross sense, but in the higher sense a discipline. If it is surely the means to the highest end we know, can any work be humble or disgusting? Will it not rather be elevating as a ladder, the means by which we are translated?How admirably the artist is made to accomplish his self-culture by devotion to his art! The wood-sawyer, through his effort to do his work well, becomes not merely a better wood-sawyer, but measurably a better man. Few are the men that can work on their navels,—only some Brahmins that I have heard of. To the painter is given some paint and canvas instead. In a thousand apparently humble ways men busy themselves to make some right take the place of some wrong, if it is only to make a better paste-blacking,—and they are themselves so much the better morally for it.You say that you do not succeed much. Does it concern you enough that you do not? Do you work hard enough at it? Do you get the benefit of discipline out of it? If so, persevere. Is it a more serious thing than to walk a thousand miles in a thousand successive hours? Do you get any corns by it? Do you ever think of hanging yourself on account of failure?If you are going into that line,—going to besiege the city of God,—you must not only be strong in engines, but prepared with provisions to starve out the garrison. An Irishman came to see me to-day, who is endeavoring to get his family out to this New World. He rises at half past four, milks twenty-eight cows (which has swollen the joints of his fingers), and eats his breakfast, without any milk in his tea or coffee, before six; and so on, day after day, for six and a half dollars a month; and thus he keeps his virtue in him, if he does not add to it; and he regards me as a gentleman able to assist him; but if I ever get to be a gentleman, it will be by working after my fashion harder than he does. If my joints are not swollen it must be because I deal with the teats of celestial cows before breakfast (and the milker in this case is always allowed some of the milk for his breakfast), to say nothing of the flocks and herds of Admetus2 afterward.It is the art of mankind to polish the world, and everyone who works is scrubbing in some part.If the work is high and far,You must not only aim aright,But draw the bow with all your might,You must qualify yourself to use a bow which no humbler archer can bend.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">January 21, 1854, Saturday; Concord, MassachusettsThoreau left for Worcester at noon on January 23 and returned to Concord at noon on January 25. From 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on January24, which Thoreau noted in his journal was “a very cold day,” he and Blake walked the six miles or so from Blake’s house near downtown Worcester north to the small town of Holden and back. Thoreau was at this date almost done with his Walden manuscript, which he would soon present to the Boston publishers Ticknor and Fields.Concord Jan 21st ‘54Mr. Blake,My coat is at last done, and my mother & sister allow that I am so far in a condition to go abroad. I feel as if I had gone abroad the moment I put it on. It is, as usual a production strange to me, the wearer, invented by some Count D’Orsay, and the maker of it was not acquainted with any of my real depressions or elevations. He only measured a peg to hang it on, and might have made the loop big enough to go over my head. It requires a not quite innocent indifference not to say insolence to wear it. Ah, the process by which we get overcoats is not what it should be. Though the church declare it righteous & its priest pardons me, my own Good Genius tells me that it is hasty & coarse & false. I expect a time when, or rather an integrity by which a man will get his coat as honestly, and as perfectly fitting as a tree its bark. Now our garments are typical of our conformity to the ways of the world, i.e. of the Devil, & to some extent react on us and poison us like that shirt which Hercules put on.1I think to come & see you next week on Monday if nothing hinders. I have just returned from Court at Cambridge, whither I was called as a witness, having surveyed a water-privilege about which there is a dispute since you were here.Ah! what foreign countries there are, greater in extent than the U. S. or Russia, and with no more souls to a square mile—stretching away one very side from every human being with whom you have no sympathy. Their humanity affects me as simply monstrous. Rocks—earth—brute beasts comparatively are not so strange to me. When I sit in the parlors or kitchens of some with whom my business brings me—I was going to say in contact—(business, like misery, makes strange bedfellows2) I feel a sort of awe and as forlorn as if I were cast away on a desolate shore—I think of Riley’s Narrative3 & his sufferings. You who soared like a merlin with your mate through the realms of ether—in the presence of the unlike drop at once to earth a mere amorphous squab—divested of your air-inflated pinions. (By the way, excuse this writing, for I amusing the stub of the last feather I chance to possess.) You travel on, however, through this dark & desert world.

With about 50,000 citizens lining the streets, Burns was escorted by federal troops from the Boston courthouse to a federal frigate, which remanded him to his owner in Virginia. A month later, on Independence Day, Thoreau read an extract from his essay “Slavery in Massachusetts” at an antislavery gathering in Framingham, Massachusetts. The full essay was given wide exposure by being reprinted in The Liberator on July 21 and on August 2 in the New York Tribune. At the same gathering and on the same stage, the fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison (1805—1879) burned a copy of the U.S. Constitution, declaring it “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell” because of its provisions allowing slavery to stand. As he mentions at the beginning of the next letter, the day after he wrote this letter he took the train into Boston to pick up his author’s copies of Walden from the publisher, Ticknor and Fields, and had the publisher send a copy of the book to Blake.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Methinks I have spent a rather unprofitable summer thus far. I have been too much with the world, as the poet might say.1 The completest performance of the highest duties it imposes would yield me but little satisfaction. Better the neglect of all such, because your life passed on a level where it was impossible to recognize them. Laterly, I have heard the very flies buzz too distinctly, and have accused myself because I did not still this superficial din. We must not be too easily distracted by the crying of children or of dynasties. The Irishman erects his sty, and gets drunk, and jabbers more and more under my eaves, and I am responsible for all that filth and folly. I find it, as ever, very unprofitable to have much to do with men. It is sowing the wind, but not reaping even the whirlwind;2 only reaping an unprofitable calm and stagnation. Our conversation is a smooth, and civil, and never-ending speculation merely. I take up the thread of it again in the morning, with very much such courage as the invalid takes his prescribed Seidlitz powders3. Shall I help you to some of the mackerel? It would be more respectable if men, as has been said before, instead of being such pigmy desperates, were Giant Despairs4. Emerson says that his life is so unprofitable and shabby for the most part, that he is driven to all sorts of resources, and, among the rest, to men. I tell him that we differ only in our resources. Mine is to get away from men. They very rarely affect me as grand or beautiful; but I know that there is a sunrise and a sunset every day. In the summer, this world is a mere watering-place,—a Saratoga,—drinking so many tumblers of Congress water; and in the winter, is it any better, with its oratorios? I have seen more men than usual, lately; and, well as I was acquainted with one, I am surprised to find what vulgar fellows they are. They do a little business commonly each day, in order to pay their board, and then they congregate in sitting-rooms and feebly fabulate and paddle in the social slush; and when I think that they have sufficiently relaxed, and am prepared to see them steal away to their shrines, they go unashamed to their beds, and take on a new layer of sloth. They may be single, or have families in their faineancy. I do not meet men who can have nothing to do with me because they have so much to do with themselves. However, I trust that a very few cherish purposes which they never declare. Only think, for a moment, of a man about his affairs! How we should respect him! How glorious he would appear! Not working for any corporation, its agent, or president, but fulfilling the end of his being! A man about his business would be the cynosure of all eyes.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">December 19, 1854, Tuesday; Concord, MassachusettsBecause he had not received enough invitations to make it worth his while, Thoreau was forced to give up his plans for a lecture tour to the West and instead began accepting engagements nearer to home. He had delivered his new “What Shall It Profit” lecture in Railroad Hall in Providence, Rhode Island, on December 6, meeting Theo Brown while in town and thereby setting up the pun which begins this letter.Concord, December 19, 1854.Mr. Blake,—I suppose you have heard of my truly providential1 meeting with Mr T. Brown; providential because it saved me from the suspicion that my words had fallen altogether on stony ground, when it turned out that there was some Worcester soil there. You will allow me to consider that I correspond with him through you.I confess that I am a very bad correspondent, so far as promptness of reply is concerned; but then I am sure to answer sooner or later. The longer I have forgotten you, the more I remember you. For the most part I have not been idle since I saw you. How does the world go with you? or rather, how do you get along without it? I have not yet learned to live, that I can see, and I fear that I shall not very soon. I find, however, that in the long run things correspond to my original idea,—that they correspond to nothing else so much; and thus a man may really be a true prophet without any great exertion. The day is never so dark, nor the night even, but that the laws at least of light still prevail, and so may make it light in our minds if they are open to the truth. There is considerable danger that a man will be crazy between dinner and supper; but it will not directly answer any good purpose that I know of, and it is just as easy to be sane. We have got to know what both life and death are, before we can begin to live after our own fashion. Let us be learning our a-b-c’s as soon as possible. I never yet knew the sun to be knocked down and rolled through a mud-puddle; he comes our honor-bright from behind every storm. Let us then take sides with the sun, seeing we have so much leisure. Let us not put all we prize into a football to be kicked, when a bladder will do as well.When an Indian is burned, his body may be broiled, it may be no more than a beefsteak. What of that? They may broil his heart, but they do not therefore broil his courage,—his principles. Be of good courage! That is the main thing.If a man were to place himself in an attitude to bear manfully the greatest evi2 that can be inflicted on him, he would find suddenly that there was no such evil to bear; his brave back would go a-begging. When Atlas got his back made up1, that was all that was required. (In this case, a priv., not pleon., and Tλἣμ.)3 The world rests on principles. The wise gods will never make underpinning of a man.

Ricketson had read Walden immediately upon its publication and had written Thoreau an admiring letter on August 12.

One such sentence reads: “It is refreshing to find…the sentiments of one man whose aim manifestly is to live and not to waste his time upon the externals of living.” The abbreviation “inst.” (for “instant”) in the second paragraph means “during the present or current month.”Concord Dec. 22nd ’54Mr. Blake,I will lecture for your Lyceum on the 4th of January next and I hope that I shall have time for that good day out of doors.

		<td class="en">June 27, 1855, Wednesday; Concord, MassachusettsThe weakness in his legs that Thoreau suffered throughout the remainder of this year and into the next was very likely a symptom of tuberculosis. Given his known susceptibility to psychosomatic illness (he suffered acutely from sympathetic lockjaw in the weeks after his older brother John died of the disease), one suspects that the weakness may have been brought about by Walden not being as well received as he had hoped. In any case, the debility caused him to postpone what would have been his third trip to Maine; instead he went on what amounted to a convalescent excursion to Cape Cod with Channing shortly after writing this letter. Neither Blake nor Brown was able to join him during his two week stay on the Cape. Essay versions of his earlier lecture course “An Excursion to Cape Cod” began appearing serially in Pumam’s Monthly for June but halted peremptorily after the August issue, ostensibly because Curtis, still the editor, had not realized that “the Cape Cod paper ‘was to be expanded into a book,’” by which he apparently meant that the whole was longer than he was willing to accommodate.Concord June 27th 1855Mr. Blake,I have been sick and good for nothing but to lie on my back and wait for something to turn up, for two or three months. This has compelled me to postpone several things, among them writing to you to whom I am so deeply in debt, and inviting you and Brown to Concord—not having brains adequate to such an exertion. I should feel a little less ashamed if I could give any name to my disorder, but I cannot, and our doctor cannot help me to it, and I will not take the name of any disease in vain. However, there is one consolation in being sick, and that is the possibility that you may recover to a better state than you were ever in before. I expected in the winter to be deep in the woods of Maine in my canoe long before this, but I am so far from that that I can only take a languid walk in Concord streets.I do not know how the mistake arose about the Cape Cod excursion. The nearest I have come to that with anybody is that about a month ago Channing proposed to me to go to Truro on Cape Cod, with him& board there awhile, but I declined. For a week past however I have been a little inclined to go there & sit on the sea-shore a week or more, but I do not venture to propose myself as the companion of him or of any peripatetic man. Not that I should not rejoice to have you and Brown or C. sitting there also. I am not sure that C. really wishes to go now—and as I go simply for the medicine of it, while I need it, I should not think it worth the while to notify him when I am about to take my bitters.</td></tr>

Long Wharf was and still is an extension into the harbor of State Street. As one might expect, “good livers” are those who know how to enjoy the pleasures of life.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The day after Thoreau wrote this letter, Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina used a walking cane to beat Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts into unconsciousness on the floor of the Senate chambers. Sumner had delivered a strident speech on “Bleeding Kansas,” where pro- and antislavery forces were violently contending with one another, and Brooks felt that Sumner had impugned the integrity of a relative. It took Sumner over three years to recover from his injuries. Thoreau does not mention this event in his journal, where he continued to concentrate heavily on observations of nature, although surely the event was a topic of conversation with Blake and Brown when they visited Concord on May 25. On the way to Fair Haven Pond, an expansion of the Sudbury River, the trio stopped at Clamshell Hill, where Thoreau found five Indian arrowheads. He had a special knack for finding arrowheads and other stone implements, in part because he knew where to look, having now studied Indian history for so many years. Thoreau reciprocated his friends’ visit with an extended stay in Worcester the following month, June 13-19, rooming first at Brown’s house and then at Blake’s. While in Worcester he sat for a photograph at the rooms of the daguerreotypist Benjamin Maxham.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1852年，富有的教友会信徒兼废奴主义者马库斯.斯普林（1810—1874）在新泽西州佩西安博伊西南一英里以外的地方买了268 英亩土地，这块土地在靠近拉里坦河河口的拉里坦湾的岸上，是拉里坦湾合作社的大本营。但是，与当时其他乌托邦公社一样，这个合作社也维持得相当艰难，最后于1860年彻底失败。1856年，作为解决财政问题的权宜之计，斯普林将这块土地重新命名为伊格尔斯伍德，并决定将它分成小块廉价出售。梭罗的朋友，教育家兼作家A.B.阿尔科特（1799—1888）也是斯普林的朋友，1856年10月到伊格尔斯伍德参观期间，他建议委托梭罗测量这块土地，并顺便发表几个演讲。10月24日，在前往伊格尔斯伍德的途中，梭罗在伍斯特停留，但是当时布莱克去了波士顿观看赛马，所以两人没有见面。梭罗和布朗以及希金森一起度过了那个下午，然后继续他的旅程。在伊格尔斯伍德期间，梭罗演讲了《散步》、《这有何益处》和《猎麋》，后者就是1853年12月他命名的《穆斯黑德湖游记》。他在给姐姐索菲亚的一封信中提到布莱克让他“回程中在伍斯特停留并演讲，”显然布莱克特别邀请他再演讲一次的是《这有何益处》，他已于1855年1月4日在伍斯特作过同样的演讲。梭罗在这封信中提到的另外三个人分别是：《纽约论坛报》著名编辑霍勒斯. 格里利（1811—1872），多年来他一直为梭罗充当非正式的文学经纪人；激进的废奴主义者以及极受欢迎的演说家亨利. 沃德. 比彻神父（1813—1887），梭罗后来在日记中这样写到他：“如果比彻比其他人更了解上帝，如果他在这方面发现了某些真理，他应该将发现发表在《西里曼期刊》（一种科学刊物）上，并且尽可能避免华丽辞藻，这样我会很感谢他”；还有最特别的一位，那就是诗人沃尔特. 惠特曼（1819—1892），梭罗于11月10日在惠特曼位于布鲁克林的家中与他见的面。那必定是一个激动人心的时刻，美国文学界的两大巨头会面，当时阿尔科特和惠特曼的母亲也在场。惠特曼回忆起两人见面时梭罗曾说过：“惠特曼，你知不知道自己比一般人更伟大、更杰出——可能产生非常重要的影响？”他同时回忆起梭罗坦白地承认：“你的很多观点我无法接受：问题可能在我：但我还是抱有不同意见。”1855年7月，《草叶集》出版，显而易见，大多数维多利亚时代的读者发现惠特曼诗中的“欲望”和“自我主义”令人不快，但是值得称道的是，梭罗能承认惠特曼的天才，虽然他有不同意见。数年后，惠特曼评价梭罗说，他“是一个令人惊奇的同伴——他很难理解——难以捉摸：但是他是一种自然的力量——代表着一种事实，一种运动和一种变革：梭罗属于美国，属于超验主义，属于抗议者……梭罗身上有一点让他和我十分接近：我指的是他无视法律——他的不顺从——他坚持自己的道路，任凭地狱的火焰燃烧一切。”如梭罗所说，惠特曼的日常习惯正好和他一样：上午学习和写作，下午散步。</td>
		<td class="en">In 1852 the wealthy Quaker abolitionist Marcus Spring (1810—1874 ) had purchased 268 acres a little over a mile southwest of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, on the shore of Raritan Bay near the mouth of Raritan River, as the home for a cooperative community, the Raritan Bay Union. Like other utopian communities of the time, however, it faltered, failing completely in 1860. But in 1856, having renamed the area Eagleswood, Spring decided as a fiscal stopgap to subdivide the land and sell of flots. Thoreau’s friend the educator and writer Amos Bronson Alcott(1799—1888) was a friend of Spring’s and during a visit to Eagleswood in October 1856 suggested that Thoreau be commissioned to survey the land and, during his visit, deliver a few lectures. On the way to Eagleswood, on October 24, Thoreau stopped off in Worcester, but because Blake had gone to a horse race in Boston, the two did not meet. Thoreau instead spent the afternoon with Brown and Higginson before continuing his journey. While at Eagles wood he lectured on “Walking,” “What Shall It Profit,” and “Moose hunting,” the latter of which he had called “An Excursion to Moosehead Lake” in December1853. He mentions in a letter to his sister Sophia that Blake had asked him “to stop at Worcester & lecture on my return,” apparently asking specifically for a repeat of “What Shall It Profit,” which he had delivered in Worcester on January 4, 1855. The three other individual she mentions in this letter are the famous editor of the New-York Tribune, Horace Greeley (1811—1872), who had for many years served him as an informal literary agent; the fiery abolitionist minister and extremely popular orator the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher (1813—1887), of whom he later wrote in his journal, “If Henry Ward Beecher knows so much more about God than another, if he has made some discovery of truth in this direction, I would thank him to publish it in Silliman’s Journal [a scientific publication], with as few flourishes as possible”; and most particularly the poet Walt Whitman (1819—1892), whom he met at Whitman’s Brooklyn home on November 10. It must have been an electric moment, this meeting of two giants of American literature, with Alcott and Whitman’s mother also being present. Whitman recollected that Thoreau said to him during their meeting, “Whitman, do you have any idea that you are rather bigger and outside the average—may perhaps have immense significance?” He also recalled Thoreau confessing, “There is much in you to which I cannot accommodate myself: the defect may be mine: but the objections are there.” Although it is easy to see how Victorian-era readers of Leaves of Grass, published in July 1855, would have found Whitman’s “sensuality” and “egotism” offensive, it is to Thoreau’s credit that he was able to recognize Whitman’s genius despite his objections. Years later Whitman remarked of Thoreau that he “was a surprising fellow—he is not easily grasped—is elusive: yet he is one of the native forces—stands for a fact, a movement, an upheaval: Thoreau belongs to America, to the transcendental, to the protestors... One thing about Thoreau keeps him very near to me: I refer to his lawlessness—his dissent—his going his own absolute road let hell blaze all it chooses.” As Thoreau notes, Whitman maintained a routine precisely like his own: morning study and writing followed by an afternoon walk.</td></tr>

As the first Harlem train unexpectedly connected with the first from Fitchburg, I did not spend the forenoon with you, as I had anticipated, on account of baggage &c—If it had been a seasonable hour I should have seen you, i.e. if you had not been gone to a horse-race. But think of making a call at half past three in the morning! (Would it not have implied a 3 o’clock in the morning courage in both you & me?) As it were ignoring the fact that mankind are really not at home—are not out, but so deeply in that they cannot be seen—nearly half their hours at this season of the year. I walked up & down the Main Street at half past 5 in the dark, and paused long in front of Brown’s store trying to distinguish its features; considering whether I might safely leave his “Putnam” in the door handle, but concluded not to risk it. Meanwhile a watchman (?) seemed to be watching me, & I moved off. Took another turn around there, a little later, and had the very earliest offer of the Transcript from an urchin behind, whom I actually could not see, it was so dark. So I with drew, wondering if you & B. would know that I had been there. You little dream who is occupying Worcester when you are all asleep. Several things occurred there that night, which I will venture to say were not put into the Transcript. A cat caught a mouse at the depot,& gave it to her kitten to play with. So that world famous tragedy goes on by night as well as by day, & nature is emphatically wrong. Also I saw a young Irishman kneel before his mother, as if in prayer, while she wiped a cinder out of his eye with her tongue; and I found that it was never too late (or early?) to learn something.—These things transpired while you and B. were, to all practical purposes, no where, & good for nothing—not even for society,—not for horseraces,—nor the taking back of a Putnam’s Magazine. It is true I might have recalled you to life, but it would have been a cruel act, considering the kind of life you would have come back to.However, I would fain write to you now by broad daylight, and report to you some of my life, such as it is, and recall you to your life, which is not always lived by you, even by day light.Blake! Blake! Are you awake? Are you aware what an ever-glorious morning this is? What long expected never to be repeated opportunity is now offered to get life & knowledge?For my part I am trying to wake up,—to wring slumber out of pores;—for, generally, I take events as unconcernedly as a fence post,—absorb wet & cold like it, and am pleasantly tickled with lichens slowly spreading over me. Could I not be content then to be a cedar post, which lasts 25 years? Would I not rather be that than the farmer that set it? or he that preaches to that farmer?—& go to the heaven of posts at last? I think I should like that as well as any would like it. But I should not care if I sprouted into a living tree, put forth leaves &flowers, & have fruit.I am grateful for what I am & have. My thanksgiving is perpetual. It is surprising how contented one can be with nothing definite—only a sense of (Eagleswood again all cut off!) existence. Well anything for variery. I am ready to try this for the next 1000 years, & exhaust it. How sweet to think of ! My extremities well charred, and my intellectual part too, so that there is no danger of worm or rot for along while. My breath is sweet to me. O how I laugh when I think of my vague indefinite riches. No run on my bank can drain it—for my wealth is not possession but enjoyment.What are all these years made for? and now another winter comes, so much like the last? Can’t we satisfy the beggars once for all? Have you got in your wood for this winter? What else have you got in? Of what use a great fire on the hearth & a confounded little fire in the heart? Are you prepared to make a decisive campaign—to pay for your costly tuition—to pay for the suns of past summers—for happiness & unhappiness lavished upon you?</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1857年11月16日，星期一；马萨诸塞州康科德很可能布莱克独自游览了怀特山，部分原因正如上一封信中所暗示的——而这封信中则说得十分明确——他恐怕自己不能承受上次七八月间缅因之行的艰苦。1857年整个夏天，美国经济增长明显放缓，九月初纽约几家银行的倒闭引发了全面的金融恐慌。有偿付能力的银行为了应对恐慌，中止了以金币兑换纸币。这次惊人的经济大衰退，后来被称为1857年大萧条，是自1837年以来最严重的一次。从缅因返回后不久，梭罗蓄了络腮胡子，一直保留着直到生命终结。1857年11月16日于康科德布莱克先生：你又开始了新的话题。如果我没有弄错，我是欠了你一两封信。现在他们穷于应付艰难时世；但是我觉得全体大众，包括牧师和其他所有人，关于这件事的观点是错误的，虽然有些牧师按照一套固定的模式布道，假装那是正确的。经济的普遍衰退，无论是个人的还是公众的，这反倒应该让人高兴，因为这提醒我们到底是谁在掌控全局——正义总会得到伸张。如果大多数商人没有破产，银行也没有破产，那我对世界古老法则的信仰将会动摇。100个商人里有96个必定要破产这种说法，可能是统计学已揭示的最令人高兴的事实——就像春天里柳树的清香，令人振奋。不是还有这样的说法：“耶和华作王，愿地快乐”吗？如果成千上万的人失业，那说明他们的工作并不适合他们。他们为什么不领会这种暗示呢？勤劳是不够的；蚂蚁也勤劳。你为了什么而勤劳？商人和公司长久以来一直嘲笑先验论和更高的法则等等，叫嚣着：“不要再宣扬你们的空话了”，仿佛他们抛锚停泊的地方是确定、可靠、永久的。如果存在一个机构，可以认定它建立在结实而可靠的基础之上，比其他机构更能代表这种可夸耀的判断力、审慎和办事才能，那就是银行；但是现在人们却发现这些银行不过是任风吹动的芦苇。在这个世界，几乎没有人能坚守承诺。似乎在这个世界的任何时代，你只要生活四十年，就会目睹最有前途的政府沦落为堪萨斯州政府，而银行则无处可寻。现在不仅布鲁克农场和傅立叶公社破产了，整个美国社会都破产了。但是空话仍然存在，安详、仁慈、一成不变。我要说困难时期有它的价值，别的不说，这种时期向我们展示了这种承诺有何价值——可靠的银行在哪里。几天前我听到某个商人受到赞扬，因为他几乎竭尽所有偿还了部分债务，（哎，我自己也这样做过许多次，甚至比他做得还多），然后开始过寄宿生活。要是他真的去过寄宿生活又怎样呢？我希望他寄宿的地方好一点，并且他能支付得起租金。不是每个人都能支付得起的。但是，就我看来，住自己房子还更便宜一点——如果你的房子不是太大的话。有时人们会对你说“挣钱很难。”我说这正表明了钱不是用来吃的。想想一个人，在这个新世界里，在他的小木屋里，在玉米地和土豆地中间，一边是羊圈，竟然谈论着挣钱很难！火石也是硬的；火石里没有合金。他种植粮食，砍木头（或劈木头），下雨时呆在屋内，如果需要，纺纱并且编织自己的衣服，挣钱难不难和这些有何关系？前几天和轮船一起沉入海底的那些人，还发现钱也是沉的呢。想想有人竟然因为这种财富而洋洋自得，仿佛它使他变得极度富有。好像一个正在海中央挣扎的人，背上驮了一袋黄金，还应该气喘吁吁地大喊：“我的身价是10万美元。”我看见他们在旱地上做着同样无效的挣扎，不，甚至更无望，因为在前种情况下，为避免沉入海底，他们最后会放开装有黄金的袋子；但是在后种情况下，他们必定会紧紧抓住袋子，和它一起堕落。我看见他们穿着厚重的大衣四处游走，收取租金，确保收到所有欠款，一口口地喝着苦水，却感觉更渴，身上浸满的水越来越多，直到最后完全沉入海底。但是这个话题就到此为止吧。你读过拉斯金的书吗？如果没有，我推荐你读一下他的《现代画家》第二卷和第三卷（不是部分）。我在读第四卷，而且最近几乎读完了他所有其他的著作。这些书异常优秀，很鼓舞人，虽然里面不乏粗糙和偏执的地方。这几卷书中涉及的主题包括永恒、美、想象力、热爱自然等等——所有主题都写得很生动，我为它们感到惊叹。值得注意的是，这些东西主要是以绘画为引子来讨论的，而不是文学。《建筑的七盏灯》也包含了很好的东西，但是，根据我的记忆，对我和霍屯督人来说，里面涉及到太多艺术的东西。我们想知道普通的事物和事情。我们的房子迄今还只是木屋。你独自游览了怀特山，一定收获颇丰。我想当我站在山顶时，将同许多人走进教堂时一样，怀着同样的敬畏。看看那是怎样的大地，在这大地上某处你或许有自己的房子和花园！那感悟仿佛就是时光流逝多年后的蓦然回首。你必须爬上山顶，才能弄清你和物质的关系以及你和你自己身体的关系，因为那里是你身体的家，虽然不是你的家。你的身体可能在那里生成，从那里返回尘土，不用绕远路从你的花园归入尘土；但如果你的灵魂继续存活，必然会离开，还会带上你的身体。你的花园同样惊人，同样辉煌。看我如何玩自己的手指！它们是我发现的最有趣的伙伴。这些手指从何处来？我对手指的控制多么奇怪！我是谁？它们是什么？——那些小山峰——叫它们麦迪逊、杰斐逊、拉斐特。这个物体是什么？我的10 根手指，我说。啊，不久它们可能就会构成华盛顿山亮晶晶的最顶层。我爬上山顶去看我身体的表亲。那里有我感兴趣的一些手指、脚趾、肠子等，因此我对它们的所有亲戚都感兴趣。我给你提议一个主题吧：准确地、完整地向你自己陈述在山中散步的意义——然后反复琢磨这篇文章，将所有重要的经历都包含其中，直到你满意。这样你就可以给出充分的理由，说明自己为何要爬上大山，因为人类总是不断地翻过大山。别以为你试过最初的十几次之后，就能很准确地讲述出来，要反复尝试，尤其是在充足的停顿后，当你怀疑自己触摸到了事物的心脏或顶峰时，你更要在那里反复推敲，对自己解释爬山的理由。故事并不一定要长，但要花很长的时间才能写得简短。你以为翻过大山不需要花很长时间；但是你真的翻过大山了吗？如果你曾经到过华盛顿山的顶峰，那么我问你，你在那里发现了什么？你知道，他们就是这样求证于证人的。爬上山顶，任大风吹面，这没有什么了不起。在山里时，我们从未攀登过很多，只是在那吃午饭等等，几乎像在家里一样。我们回家后，才是真的翻过了大山，如果说我们曾经有过这种经历的话。山说过什么？山做过什么？</td>
		<td class="en">November 16, 1857, Monday; Concord, MassachusettsVery likely Blake undertook his solitary journey to the White Mountains in part because of the suggestion implicit in the previous letter—and made quite explicit in this letter—that he would not have been up to the rigors of the Maine excursion of July-August. Throughout the summer of 1857 the American economy had slowed noticeably, and in early September the failure of several New York banks precipitated a full scale financial panic. Banks that remained solvent reacted to the panic by suspending specie payments. This dramatic economic downturn, afterward called the Depression of1857, was the worst since the Depression of 1837. Sometime after returning from Maine, Thoreau grew a full beard, which he kept for the remainder of his life.Concord, November 16, 1857.Mr. Blake,—You have got the start again. It was I that owed you a letter or two, if I mistake not.They make a great ado nowadays about hard times; but I think that the community generally, ministers and all, take a wrong view of the matter, though some of the ministers preaching according to a formula may pretend to take a right one. This general failure, both private and public, is rather occasion for rejoicing, as reminding us whom we have at the helm,—that justice is always done. If our merchants did not most of them fail, and the banks too, my faith in the old laws of the world would be staggered. The statement that ninety-six in a hundred doing such business surely break down is perhaps the sweetest fact that statistics have revealed,—exhilarating as the fragrance of sallows in spring. Does it not say somewhere, “The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice”1? If thousands are thrown out of employment, it suggests that they were not well employed. Why don’t they take the hint? It is not enough to be industrious; so are the ants. What are you industrious about?The merchants and company have long laughed at transcendentalism, higher laws, etc., crying, “None of your moonshine,” as if they were anchored to something not only definite, but sure and permanent. If there was any institution which was presumed to rest on a solid and secure basis, and more than any other represented this boasted common sense, prudence, and practical talent, it was the bank; and now those very banks are found to be mere reeds shaken by the wind2.Scarcely one in the land has kept its promise. It would seem as if you only need live forty years in any age of this world, to see its most promising government become the government of Kansas, and banks nowhere. Not merely the Brook Farm and Fourierite communities3, but now the community generally has failed. But there is the moonshine still, serene, beneficent, and unchanged. Hard times, I say, have this value, among others, that they show us what such promises are worth,—where the sure banks are. I heard some merchant praised the other day because he had paid some of his debts, though it took nearly all he had (why, I’ve done as much as that myself many times, and a little more), and then gone to board. What if he has? I hope he’s got a good boarding-place, and can pay for it. It’s not everybody that can. However, in my opinion, it is cheaper to keep house, —i.e., if you don’t keep too big a one.Men will tell you sometimes that “money’s hard.” That shows it was not made to eat, I say. Only think of a man in this new world, in his log cabin, in the midst of a corn and potato parch, with a sheepfold on one side, talking about money being hard! So are flints hard; there is no alloy in them. What has that to do with his raising his food, cutting his wood (or breaking it), keeping in-doors when it rains, and, if need be, spinning and weaving his clothes? Some of those who sank with the steamer the other day found out that money was heavy too. Think of a man’s priding himself on this kind of wealth, as if it greatly enriched him. As if one struggling in mid-ocean with a bag of gold on his back should gasp out, “I am worth a hundred thousand dollars.” I see them struggling just as ineffectually on dry land, nay, even more hopelessly, for, in the former case, rather than sink, they will finally let the bag go; but in the latter they are pretty sure to hold and go down with it. I see them swimming about in their greatcoats, collecting their rents, really getting their dues, drinking bitter draughts which only increase their thirst, becoming more and more water-logged, till finally they sink plumb down to the bottom. But enough of this.Have you ever read Ruskin’s4 books? If not, I would recommend you to try the second and third volumes (not parts) of his “Modern Painters.” I am now reading the fourth, and have read most of his other books lately. They are singularly good and encouraging, though not without crudeness and bigotry. The themes in the volumes referred to are infinity, Beauty, Imagination, Love of Nature, etc.,—all treated in a very living manner. I am rather surprised by them. It is remarkable that these things should be said with reference to painting chiefly, rather than literature. The “Seven Lamps of Architecture,” too, is made of good stuff; but, as I remember, there is too much about art in it for me and the Hottentots5. We want to know about matters and things in general. Our house is as yet a hut.You must have been enriched by your solitary walk over the mountains. I suppose that I feel the same awe when on their summits that many do on entering a church. To see what kind of earth that is on which you have a house and garden somewhere, perchance! It is equal to the lapse of many years. You must ascend a mountain to learn your relation to matter, and so to your own body, for it is at home there, though you are not. It might have been composed there, and will have no farther to go to return to dust there, than in your garden; but your spirit inevitably comes away, and brings your body with it, if it lives. Just as awful really, and as glorious, is your garden. See how I can play with my fingers! They are the funniest companions I have ever found. Where did they come from? What strange control I have over them! Who am I? What are they?—those little peaks—call them Madison, Jefferson, Lafayette. What is the matter? My fingers ten, I say. Why, erelong, they may form the top-most crystal of Mount Washington. I go up there to see my body’s cousins. There are some fingers, toes, bowels, etc., that I take an interest in, and therefore I am interested in all their relations.Let me suggest a theme for you: to state to yourself precisely and completely what that walk over the mountains amounted to for you,—returning to this essay again and again, until you are satisfied that all that was important in your experience is in it. Give this good reason to yourself for having gone over the mountains, for mankind is ever going over a mountain. Don’t suppose that you can tell it precisely the first dozen times you try, but at’em again, especially when, after a sufficient pause, you suspect that you are touching the heart or summit of the matter, reiterate your blows there, and account for the mountain to yourself. Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long while to make it short. It did not take very long to get over the mountain, you thought; but have you got over it indeed? If you have been to the top of Mount Washington, let me ask, what did you find there? That is the way they prove witnesses, you know. Going up there and being blown on is nothing. We never do much climbing while we are there, but we eat our luncheon, etc., very much as at home. It is after we get home that we really go over the mountain, if ever. What did the mountain say? What did the mountain do?</td></tr>

The night of July 4 they camped near Senter (usually Center) Harbor, New Hampshire, a village at the northern extremity of Lake Winnepesaukee. On July 7 they stopped by the Glen House below Pinkham Notch, left a note there for Blake, and ascended Mount Washington, joined by one William H. H. Wentworth, whom Hoar had hired on as a packer. The following afternoon, as Thoreau reported in his journal, “we heard, as we thought, a faint shout, and it occurred to me that Blake... might possibly be looking for me; but soon Wentworth decided that it must be a bear, for they make a noise like a woman in distress. He has caught many of them. Nevertheless, we shouted in return and waved alight coat on the meadow. After an hour or two had elapsed, we heard the voice again, nearer, and saw two men, and I went up the stream to meet Blake and Brown, wet, ragged, and bloody with black flies.” The next morning Thoreau sprained his ankle in Tuckerman Ravine and had to lay up the remainder of that day and the next. The five man party continued botanizing on and around Mount Washington until July 16, when Thoreau, Hoar, Blake, and Brown headed home, arriving in Concord at noon on July 19.

		<td class="en">January 1, 1859, Saturday; Concord, MassachusettsIn late November Cholmondeley had mailed Thoreau a letter from Montreal stating that he would be visiting Boston before heading to the West Indies for the winter, whither he asked Thoreau to join him. Later, after Cholmondeley’s arrival, he suggested to Thoreau that they explore the valley of the Amazon together, but Thoreau demurred once again, telling his English friend, “I think I had better stay in Concord.” Thoreau’s two most fervent admirers outside of his family, Blake and Ricketson, met one another and apparently did not hit it off particularly well. They were, in fact, very different personalities—Blake extremely serious and highly idealistic, Ricket son remarkably self-absorbed and literal-minded. Emerson and his compeers in the Saturday Club, had they stuck to their routine of meeting the last Saturday of the month, would have convened at the Parker House in Boston on Christmas Day. It would appear that Emerson attempted to attract Thoreau to the meeting.Concord, January 1, 1859.Mr. Blake,—It may interest you to hear that Cholmondeley has been this way again, via Montreal and Lake Huron, going to the West Indies, or rather to Weissnichtwo1, whither he urges me to accompany him. He is rather more demonstrative than before, and, on the whole, what would be called “a good fellow,”—is a man of principle, and quite reliable, but very peculiar. I have been to New Bedford with him, to show him a whaling town and Ricketson. I was glad to hear that you had called on R. How did you like him? I suspect that you did not see one another fairly.I have lately got back to that glorious society called Solitude, where we meet our friends continually, and can imagine the outside world also to be peopled. Yet some of my acquaintance would fain hustle me into the almshouse for the sake of society, as if I were pining for that diet, when I seem to myself a most befriended man, and find constant employment. However, they do not believe a word I say. They have got a club, the handle of which is in the Parker House at Boston, and with this they beat me from time to rime, expecting to make me render or minced meat, so fit for a club to dine off.“Hercules with his clubThe Dragon did drub;But More of More Hall,With nothing at all,He slew the Dragon of Wantle.” 2Ah! that More of More Hall knew what fair play was. Channing, who wrote to me about it once, brandishing the club vigorously (being set on by another, probably), says now, seriously, that he is sorry to find by my letters that I am “absorbed in politics,” and adds, begging my pardon for his plainness, “Beware of an extraneous life!” and so he does his duty, and washes his hands of me. I tell him that it is as if he should say to the sloth, that Fellow that creeps so slowly along a tree, and cries ai from time to time, “Beware of dancing!”The doctors are all agreed that I am suffering from want of society. Was never a case like it. First, I did not know that I was suffering at all. Secondly, as an Irishman might say, I had thought it was indigestion of the society I got. It is indispensable that I should take a dose of Lowell& Agassiz & Woodman.As for the Parker House, I went there once, when the Club was away, but I found it hard to see through the cigar smoke, and men were deposited about in chairs over the marble floor, as thick as legs of bacon in a smoke-house. It was all smoke, and no salt, Attics3 or other. The only room in Boston which I visit with alacrity is the Gentlemen’s Room4 at the Fitchburg Depot, where I wait for the cars, sometimes for two hours, in order to get out of town. It is a paradise to the Parker House, for no smoking is allowed, and there is far more retirement. A large and respectable club of us hire it (Town and Country Club5), and I am pretty sure to find some one there whose face is set the same way as my own.My last essay, on which I am still engaged, is called Autumnal Tints. I do not know how readable (i.e., by me to others) it will be.</td></tr>

In the letter to which Thoreau responds here, Blake once again suggested that his friend deliver “What Shall It Profit” a second time in Worcester, either overlooking the remark in Letter 41 about “Autumnal Tints” or assuming Thoreau would not have that nascent lecture ready in goodtime. Blake also appears to have mentioned in his letter having written a paper about his “adventures in the Ravine.” Tuckerman Ravine is doubtless meant, and the paper was almost certainly the result of Blake’s compliance with the suggestion in Letter 37 that he “state to [himself ] precisely and completely what his solitary walk over the mountains amounted to” for him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">September 26, l859, Monday; Concord, MassachusettsThe Thoreau family business thrived throughout the 1850s, and with the death of his father Thoreau was left to run it himself, which reduced dramatically the free time he had become accustomed to enjoying over the years. Blake and Brown visited him in Concord on April 28, and the following month he again met John Brown, who once more visited Concord from Kansas. As he had done during his previous visit, Brown spoke at the Concord Town Hall, but this time Thoreau was considerably more impressed with Brown than he had been before. Doubtless inspired by Thoreau accounts of Cape Cod, Blake visited the Cape himself but clearly found the place not so much to his liking.Concord Sep. 26th 1859Mr. Blake,I am not sure that I am in a fit mood to write to you, for I feel & think rather too much like a business man, having some very irksome affairs to attend to these months and years on account of my family. This is the way I am serving King Admetus1—confound him! If it were not for my relations I would let the wolves prey on his flocks to their bellies’ content. Such fellows you have to deal with! herdsmen of some other king, or of the same, who tell no tale, but in the sense of counting their flocks, & then lie drunk under a hedge. How is your grist ground?—Not by some murmuring stream, while you lie dreaming on the bank, but, it seems, you must take hold with your hands & shove the wheel round. You can’t depend on streams, poor feeble things! You can’t depend on worlds, left to themselves, but you’ve got to oil them &goad them along. In short, you’ve got to carry on 2 farms at once, the farm on the earth, and the farm in your mind. Those Crimean and Italian battles were mere boy’s play—they are the scrapes into which truants get. But what a battle a man must fight everywhere to maintain his standing army of thoughts, & march with them in orderly array through the always hostile country! How many enemies there are to sane thinking! Every soldier has succumbed to them before he enlists for those other battles. Men may sit in chambers, seemingly safe &sound, & yet despair, and turn out at last only hollowness & dust within, like a Dead-sea apple2. A standing army of numerous, brave, & well disciplined thoughts, & you at the head of them, marching straight to your goal! —How to bring this about is the problem, & Scotts’ Tactics3 will not help you to it. Think of a poor fellow begirt only with a sword belt,& no such staff of athletic thoughts! his brains rattling as he walks, and talks! —These are your Pretorian guard.It is easy enough to maintain a family, or a state, but it is hard to maintain these children of your brain (or say rather these guests that trust to enjoy your hospitality), they make such great demands; and yet he who does only the former, and loses the power to think originally, or as only he ever can, falls miserably. Keep up the fires of thought and all will go well.Zouaves?—Pish! How you can overrun a country, climb any rampart, and carry any fortress, with an army of alert thoughts!—thoughts that send their bullets home to heaven’s door—with which you can take the whole world, without paying for it, or robbing any body. See the conquering hero comes! You fail in your thoughts, or you prevail in your thoughts only. Provided you think well, the heavens falling, or the earth gaping, will be music for you to march by. No foe can ever see you, or you him; you cannot so much as think of him. Swords have no edges, bullets no penetration, for such a contest. In your mind must be a liquor which will dissolve the world whenever it is dropt in it. There is no universal solvent but this, & all things together cannot saturate it. It will hold the universe in solution, & yet be as translucent as ever. The vast machine may indeed roll over our toes, & we not know it, but it would rebound & be staved to pieces like an empty barrel, if it should strike fair & square, on the smallest & least angular of a man’s thoughts.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">October 31, 1859, Monday; Concord, MassachusettsBlake visited Thoreau on October 13, staying overnight and joining him the next morning for a walk around Flint’s Pond in Lincoln, Massachusetts, one of the towns adjoining Concord. During this month Thoreau began work on a massively ambitious project, Wild Fruits, wherein he planned to catalog and describe in considerable detail the complete natural history of all the naturally occurring fruits of his hometown in their order of ripening, as well as survey how humankind over the millennia had used and enjoyed each of those fruits. Unfortunately, this project was left unfinished at his death, and a reconstructed version of the incomplete project was not published until 2000. On October 19, five days after Blake returned home from his visit, the first report arrived in Concord of John Brown’s raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia).Brown and twenty-one men aspired to rid the land of the iniquity of slavery by leading an insurrection and arming the slaves with weapons from the arsenal. Instead, ten of the men were killed, including two of Brown’s sons; five escaped and were never caught. Brown was among the remaining six who were captured and quickly brought to trial. Thoreau’s response to the initial reports was swift, decisive, unequivocal. Brown’s character, if not his specific actions, must be defended at all hazards. Thoreau’s journal, filled with observations about nature in the days leading up to October 19, is filled with nothing but his thoughts on the John Brown affair through the remainder of the month. As more news came to him through the Boston newspapers, particularly the reports of what Brown said to his captors as he lay wounded on the armory’s engine house floor, Thoreau’s indignation mounted, as did his respect for Brown’s character. While the nation rowdily debated the import of this incredibly dramatic event and argued about Brown’s sanity, Thoreau organized his journal comments into a lecture. When he sent word around town that he would deliver a defense of Brown, the local abolitionists responded that a defense at that time might be counterproductive. Thoreau replied, “I did not send to you for advice, but to announce that I am to speak.” His lecture “A Plea for Captain John Brown,” delivered in the vestry of the Unitarian Meetinghouse in Concord on October 30, made him the first person in the country to speak out publicly in support of Brown. It was a daring, even a dangerous act, but wholly characteristic. The lecture inaugurated a gradual swaying of the public’s mind in the Free States, a development that was completed eighteen months later, when many troops assembled from those states and marched southward to the song “John Brown’s Body.” Two days after the Concord lecture and the day after this letter to Blake, November 1, Thoreau read the lecture again, this time in one of Boston’s foremost auditoriums, the Tremont Temple. The black abolitionist orator Frederick Douglass had been scheduled to speak, but he had left hastily for Canada, fearing reprisals for his suspected involvement in planning Brown’s raid. On October 31, probably after writing to Blake, Thoreau had received an urgent telegram from Boston asking him to stand in for Douglass. The lecture was scheduled for 7:30 p.m., but Tremont Hall was filled with 2,500 auditors at 7 p.m. Thoreau spoke for an hour and a half, giving what seems to have been one of his best performances on the lecture platform, for the newspaper reports indicate that the audience listened with “enthusiastic approval” and that Thoreau’s speech was several times interrupted by applause. When Blake received this letter from Thoreau, he quickly rented Washburn Hall in Worcester’s new Mechanic’s Hall building on Main Street for Thursday, November 3.Higginson was not in town when the letter arrived but was returning from upstate New York, where he had gone to speak with Mrs. Brown in North Elba about persuading her husband to allow his friends in the North to rescue him from prison. (Brown, understanding that his martyrdom was far more valuable to the cause of abolition than his life, had refused offers of rescue.) The court in Virginia issued its verdict the day before Thoreau’s Worcester engagement, November 2: death by hanging in one month. The next day’s newspapers contained the text of John Brown’s last speech to the court, a speech that many American school children throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century were required to recite from memory. Thoreau read Brown’s brief speech at the close of his Worcester lecture that evening. The next day he stopped by Alcott’s house in Concord and reported on both his Boston and Worcester lectures, after which Alcott wrote in his diary, “Thoreau has good right to speak fully his mind concerning Brown, and has been the first to speak and celebrate the hero’s courage and magnanimity. It is these which he discerns and praises. The men have much in common: the sturdy manliness, straight-forwardness and independence. It is well they met, and that Thoreau saw what he sets forth as no one else can.”Concord Oct 31stMr. Blake.I spoke to my townsmen last evening on “the character of Capt. Brown, now in the clutches of the slaveholder.” I should like to speak to any company in Worcester who may wish to hear me, & will come, if only my expenses are paid.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1860年5月20日，星期日；马萨诸塞州康科德2月8日，梭罗在康科德发表了新的演讲《野苹果》。它是《野果》的一部分，去年10月，梭罗就开始写《野果》，正好是布莱克上次来访期间。《野苹果》演讲后不久，他阅读了美国最早版本的《物种起源》，这本著作是当时知识界的一枚炸弹，至今人们依然争论不休。查尔斯. 达尔文（1809—1882）于去年10月在伦敦出版了这部专著。他知道这部著作将引起人们的争论，事实确实如此。梭罗是最早阅读这本书的美国人之一，而且因为他思想异常开放，在自然史方面阅读广泛，尤其是1851年之后，所以他是这本书特别合适的读者。这本书的最后一章含有一个强有力的请求，达尔文鼓励那些拥有支持“发展”论（现在普遍称为进化论）的证据的自然史学者，收集并发表他们的证据。梭罗马上对此作出了回应，他开始整理种子传播和森林演替方面的观察资料，这些资料分散在他十多年来的日记中。梭罗十分清楚，这些资料能够有力地甚至决定性地证明达尔文进化论最关键几环中的一环，即物种的地理分布。1860年9月20日，梭罗在康科德宣读了论文《森林演替》。此后不久，这篇文章多次重印。遗憾的是，他没有完成著作《种子传播》就去世了，直到1993年，著作残稿才得以整理出版，书名为《种子的信仰》。在这本书的手稿中，梭罗雄辩地总结了自己对达尔文进化论的思考：“发展论说明了大自然中存在着一种更强大的生命力，因为它有更强的灵活性和适应性，等同于某种持续不断的新创造。”这也正是梭罗的宗教观点。1860年5月20日于康科德布莱克先生：我必须努力偿还对你欠下的一些债务。那么从我们上次停下的地方开始吧。假设我们总是不变的；我们的机遇和大自然本身是变化的。看看人类，表面看来，人和人之间没有很大差别；他们可能有相同的高度、宽度和重量；但是对于东方人来说，生活是令人厌倦、一成不变的，如尘土一般，他把自己的想象力（！）（他重要器官之间的摩擦力）溺死在碗里。而对于他的同代人（！），即西方人来说，生活是成就各种崇高事业的园地，是极乐世界，是英雄和骑士的居所。前者抱怨说，他有一千件事情要处理；但他没有意识到，他的事情（即使有一千件）和他本人是同一的。男人和男孩学习各种手艺，唯独没有学习如何做人。他们学习建房子，但住得并不好，他们在房子里不像洞里的土拨鼠那样感到满足。如果你没有尚好的星球安置房子，房子又有何用？如果你不能容忍房子所在的星球，房子又有何用？先把土地分级。如果一个人相信并期望自己能取得很大的成就，无论你把他放在何处或使他见到何物，都没有多大区别，（当然，你不能把他放在任何地方或向他展示任何东西，）他将被辉煌围绕。他的处境像一个健康而饥饿的人，他对自己说——面包皮真香甜！如果一个人对自己绝望，托非特地狱将是他的住所，他的处境像一个病人，即使最可口的水果，也会让他厌恶。</td>
		<td class="en">May 20, 1860, Sunday; Concord, MassachusettsThoreau had delivered a new lecture, “Wild Apples,” in Concord on February 8. It was part of Wild Fruits, the project he had begun working on the previous October, right around the time of Blake’s last visit. Shortly after his delivery of “Wild Apples,” he read the first American edition of On the Origin of Species, an intellectual bombshell that continues to be controversial in our time. Charles Darwin (1809-1882)had published the treatise in London the preceding October. He knew it would spark controversy, and it certainly did that. Thoreau was one of the first Americans to read the book, and because of his incredible open-mindedness and his wide reading in natural history, particularly since 1851, he was an unusually fit reader for this particular book. The   final chapter contains an eloquent plea encouraging natural historians with evidence supporting the “developmental” thesis (now more popularly known as the theory of evolution) to gather and present their evidence. Thoreau responded by immediately beginning to assemble the observations on seed dispersion and forest succession scattered throughout his journal of the preceding ten and more years. As Thoreau well knew, those observations firmly, even conclusively supported one of the most critical links in Darwin’s argument, the one on the geographical distribution of species. He read a paper on “The Succession of Forest Trees” in Concord on September 20, 1860.The essay was widely reprinted shortly thereafter. Regrettably, he did not live to complete his treatise The Dispersion of Seeds, the scattered leaves of which were not reconstructed and published until1993 in Faith in a Seed. In that manuscript he eloquently sums up his thoughts on Darwin’s revolutionary theory: “The development theory implies a greater vital force in nature, because it is more flexible and accommodating, and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation.” Precisely the same point can be made about Thoreau’s religious thought.Concord May 20 1860Mr. Blake,I must endeavor to pay some of my debts to you.To begin where we left off then.The presumption is that we are always the same; our opportunities & Nature herself fluctuating. Look at mankind. No great difference between two, apparently; perhaps the same height and breadth and weight; and yet to the man who sits most E., this life is a weariness, routine, dust and ashes, and he drowns his imaginary cares (!) (a sort of friction among his vital organs), in a bowl. But to the man who sits most W., his contemporary (!), it is a field for all noble endeavors, an elysium, the dwelling place of heroes & knights. The former complains that he has a thousand affairs to attend to; but he does not realize, that his affairs, (though they may be a thousand, ) and he are one.Men & boys are learning all kinds of trades but how to make men of themselves. They learn to make houses, but they are not so well housed, they are not so contented in their houses, as the woodchucks in their holes. What is the use of a house if you haven’t got a tolerable planet to put it on? If you can not tolerate the planet it is on? Grade the ground first. If a man believes and expects great things of himself, it makes no odds where you put him, or what you show him, (of course, you cannot put him anywhere nor show him anything,) he will be surrounded by grandeur. He’s in the condition of a healthy & hungry man, who says to himself—How sweet this crust is!If he despairs of himself, then Tophet is his dwelling place, and he is in the condition of a sick man who is disgusted with the fruits of finest flavor.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">December 2, 1860, Sunday; Concord, MassachusettsThe results of the election earlier in the month reflected a deeply divided country. Lincoln’s victory prompted secession conventions in seven states of the Deep South, and by the end of November the convention in South Carolina had rapidly moved toward a resolution to secede. Its Ordinance of Secession would not be formally issued, however, until December 20. On November 29 Thoreau had met with Alcott to discuss a meeting in Boston to commemorate the upcoming anniversary of the execution of John Brown. Alcott had a very bad cold at the time, apparently picked up four days before while attending a convention of the Massachusetts Teachers’ Association, and he apparently passed the cold on to Thoreau, who began suffering the symptoms four days later, at about the time he wrote this letter to Blake. Rather than cancel his Waterbury lecture engagement so that he could convalesce, he kept the engagement (he delivered “Autumnal Tints”) and exacerbated what he later described as an already severe cold. As planned, he stopped off at Worcester on December 11 and stayed the night with Blake. A friend of Blake’s stopped by to meet Thoreau that evening and described him as a very sick man. If his cold did not worsen into bronchitis before the trip to Waterbury, it certainly did during or very soon afterward. He remained housebound throughout the winter, during which time he busied himself with his natural history manuscripts and reading. He would never recover.Concord Dec 2d’60</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1861年5月3日，星期五；马萨诸塞州康科德12月20日南卡罗来纳州首先脱离联邦，接着密西西比州（1月9日）、佛罗里达州（1月10日）、亚拉巴马州（1月11日）、佐治亚州（1月19日）、路易斯安那州（1月26日）和德克萨斯州（2月1日）也相继脱离联邦。稍后，这七个州于2月颁布了新邦联的宪法，提名杰.斐逊 戴维斯为选举前的临时总统。脱离联邦的七个州还占领了他们境内的联邦要塞或者要求现政府交出这些要塞，但是布坎南总统拒绝交出任何要塞。在这种危急关头，堪萨斯被纳入联邦（1月29日）。2月末，布莱克和布朗花了两天的时间，通过溜冰和步行从伍斯特来到康科德，他们和梭罗一起度过了一天半的时间，进行了“充实的谈话”，虽然梭罗承认他的“气管还没康复。”林肯的就职典礼于3月4日举行。他宣布不打算在已经存在奴隶制的那些州内结束奴隶制，但同时也表明不接受各州脱离联邦政府。4月初，林肯通知南卡罗来纳，他会重新为查尔斯顿港的萨姆特要塞提供给养。4月10日， P.G.T.博勒加德准将要求要塞驻军马上投降，他当时统领临时邦联政府在联邦要塞周围的军队。4月12日，要塞指挥官拒绝投降，于是临时联邦政府军队炮轰要塞，要塞于第二天投降。4月15日，林肯发表声明，宣布存在“叛乱”，并招募 75000名“来自联邦政府好几个州的民兵”。同时，梭.罗的医生乔赛亚  巴特勒特，也就是《瓦尔登湖》“阅读”一章最后提到的“B医生”，建议梭罗到更暖和的地方疗养。由于各种复杂的原因，梭罗很可能决定去明尼苏达州，但信中并未明确地说明原因。其中的一个原因是，十年前，他的一位患有呼吸道疾病的远房兄弟搬到那里，之后病情有所好转。而且，东部报纸上出现了许多谈及明尼苏达州的气候有益于健康的文章。这些文章的出现有以下三个原因：第一，成千上万的东部人患有肺结核，第二，开往明尼苏达（那时相对比较偏远）的火车正寻求更多的客源，第三，明尼苏达的拓荒者急于鼓励更多人移民到这个州。不管怎样，5月11日，梭罗在伍斯特逗留，与布莱克和布朗一起度过了两天。梭罗因病而无法行走，所以三人乘坐马车游览了乡村。梭罗后来前往西部，与他同行的.是年轻的自然学家小霍勒斯曼（1844—1868），他的父亲是著名的教育家，当时他们家刚搬到康科德。“德恩雷斯”现在叫“东迪比克”，位于伊利诺伊州，正好在爱荷华州的迪比克对面，它们之间隔着密西西比河。富尔顿位于伊利诺伊州，也在密西西比河上，在东迪比克东南偏南50英里处。梭罗给布莱克的最后一封信里，以“道德”二字结尾是完全恰当的。1861年5月3日于康科德布莱克先生：同上次与你和布朗见面时相比，我的病情没有好转，甚至可能变得更重了，照这样下去，在我的支气管炎好之前，冷天气可能就会再次来临。因此医生告诉我必须“离开这里”，前往西印度群岛或其他地方，他好像不怎么在意我去哪个地方。但是我不准备去西印度群岛，那里的夏天闷热潮湿，我也不想去南欧，去一趟需要大量的时间和金钱，最后我决定去呼吸明尼苏达州的空气，比如圣保罗，这对我是最适宜的。现在我就等病情好转一点后启程——希望一周或十天内可以出发。内陆空气可能马上就会对我有所帮助，也可能不会。无论如何，病情如此，我必须仔细琢磨，让自己在旅程中尽可能地舒适——如果需要，就停下来休息。我想买一张到芝加哥的通票——途中可以随时停下来，第一次重要的停留选在尼亚加拉大瀑布——在那里逗留几天或一周，投宿私人旅馆，然后在底特律呆一晚或一天——在芝加哥也如此，我的健康需要这样的旅程安排。</td>
		<td class="en">May 3, 1861, Friday; Concord, MassachusettsThe secession of South Carolina on December 20 had been followed by the secession of Mississippi (January 9), Florida (January 10), Alabama (January 11), Georgia (January 19), Louisiana (January 26), and Texas (February 1). These seven states formed a Confederate constitution later in February and named Jefferson Davis provisional president pending elections. The seceded states also occupied or insisted on the surrender of federal forts within their borders, but President Buchanan refused to surrender any forts. During this period of crisis Kansas was admitted to the Union (January 29). At the end of February Blake and Brown ice-skated and walked to Concord from Worcester, the trip taking two days, and spent a day and a half enjoying “a solid talk” with Thoreau, although he confessed that his “pipes were not in good order.” Lincoln’s inauguration took place on March 4. He announced that he had no plans to end slavery in those states where it already existed, but he also said he would not accept secession. Lincoln informed South Carolina in early April that he would resupply Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, and on April 10 Brigadier General Pierre Gustare Toutant Beauregard, in command of the provisional Confederate forces around the Union garrison, demanded its immediate surrender. When the garrison commander refused to surrender on April 12, Confederate batteries opened fire on the fort, which surrendered the following day. Lincoln issued a proclamation on April 15 announcing the existence of an “insurrection” and calling forth 75,000 of “the militia of the several States of the Union.” Meanwhile, the physician attending Thoreau, Dr. Josiah Bartlett, the “Dr. B” mentioned near the end of the “Reading” chapter of Walden, had given his advice for Thoreau to visit warmer climes. Thoreau likely decided on Minnesota for a complex of reasons not mentioned in his letter. For one, a distant cousin had moved there a decade before with a respiratory ailment and had improved. Also, many stories were appearing in the Eastern press about the salutary effects of Minnesota’s climate. The stories seem to have sprung from three facts: hundreds of thousands of Easterners suffered from tuberculosis, railroads to Minnesota (then relatively remote) were looking for more passengers, and pioneers in Minnesota were eager to encourage migration to their state. In any case, Thoreau stopped in Worcester on May 11 and spent two days with Blake and Brown. He was unable to walk because of his illness, so the three men instead toured the countryside in a horse-drawn carriage. Thoreau was on his way west, accompanied by the young naturalist Horace Mann Jr. (1844—1868), the son of the famous educator, whose family had recently moved to Concord. “Dunleith,” just across the Mississippi River from Dubuque, Iowa, is now named East Dubuque, Illinois. Fulton, Illinois, also on the Mississippi River, is fifty miles south-southeast of East Dubuque. It is altogether fitting that the final word of this, Thoreau’s last letter to Blake, is “moral.”Concord May 3rd 1861Mr. Blake,I am still as much an invalid as when you & Brown were here, if not more of one, and at this rate there is danger that the cold weather may come again, before I get over my bronchitis. The Doctor accordingly tells me that I must “clear out,” to the West Indies, or elsewhere, he does not seem to care much where. But I decide against the West Indies, on account of their muggy heat in the summer, & the S. of Europe, on ac of the expense of time & money, and have at last concluded that it will be most expedient for me to try the air of Minnesota, say somewhere about St Paul. I am only waiting to be well enough to start—hope to get off within a week or 10 days.The inland air may help me at once, or it may not. At any rate I am so much of an invalid that I shall have to study my comfort in traveling to a remarkable degree—stopping to rest &c &c if need be. I think to get a through ticket to Chicago—with liberty to stop frequently on the way, making my first stop of consequence at Niagara Falls—several days or a  week, at a private boarding house—then a night or day at Detroit—& as much at Chicago, as my health may require.</td></tr>
