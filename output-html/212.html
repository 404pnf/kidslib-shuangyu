		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那是1897年的夏天，塔尔沃特家遇到了麻烦。在十分压抑且伤心地度过了安静的十年之后，塔尔沃特爷爷又爆发了。这次是克朗代克热。他这种病最先出现且一直不变的一个症状就是唱歌。他只唱一段歌曲，尽管他仅仅记得第一节，还只是这一节的三行歌词。当他提高他那沙哑的嗓音时，家人就知道他的脚有些痒痒了，脑子里也全是以前的疯狂往事。他现在就在用假音唱：</td>
		<td class="en">It was the summer of 1897, and there was trouble in the Tarwater family.Grandfather Tarwater, after remaining properly subdued and crushed for a quiet decade, had broken out again.This time it was the Klondike fever.His first and one unvarying symptom of such attacks was song.One chant only he raised, though he remembered no more than the first stanza and but three lines of that.And the family knew his feet were itching and his brain was tingling with the old madness, when he lifted his hoarse-cracked voice, now falsetto-cracked, in:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就像古时候的阿格斯，我们离开了这个现代的希腊，嗒—嗒，嗒—嗒，嗒，嗒，嗒—嗒，来剪金羊毛。</td>
		<td class="en">Like Argus of the ancient times,We leave this modern Greece,Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum, tum, tum-tum,To shear the Golden Fleece.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >早在十年前，配着“颂歌”的旋律，他就唱过这一段，那时候他正沉湎于去巴塔哥尼亚淘金的狂热中。这个人口众多的一家子曾开会讨论过如何对付他的这种病，但实施起来还是很困难。当其他所有人都不能动摇他的决心时，他们为他申请了律师，威胁他说，要拿出监护文件把他关在收纳精神失常者的州收容所里——这样对他也不是没有道理，因为在二十五年前，他因为投机买卖失败，只剩下了加利福尼亚州十英亩贫瘠的土地，从此以后，他再也没有展示出更好的生意头脑。</td>
		<td class="en">Ten years earlier he had lifted the chant, sung to the air of the “Doxology,” when afflicted with the fever to go gold-mining in Patagonia.The multitudinous family had sat upon him, but had had a hard time doing it.When all else had failed to shake his resolution, they had applied lawyers to him, with the threat of getting out guardianship papers and of confining him in the state asylum for the insane—which was reasonable for a man who had, a quarter of a century before, speculated away all but ten meagre acres of a California principality, and who had displayed no better business acumen ever since.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为约翰·塔尔沃特申请律师，就像给他涂抹芥末膏药一样，令他心有余悸。因为，在他看来，他们是贵族，比任何人都要高贵，他们只会把他赶出辽阔的塔尔沃特庄园。所以，当他沉浸于巴塔哥尼亚狂热时，那个烈性药方的想法就足以治好他。很快他就放弃了那种狂热，同意不去巴塔哥尼亚，以此表明他不是疯子。</td>
		<td class="en">The application of lawyers to John Tarwater was like the application of a mustard plaster.For, in his judgment, they were the gentry, more than any other, who had skinned him out of the broad Tarwater acres.So, at the time of his Patagonian fever, the very thought of so drastic a remedy was sufficient to cure him.He quickly demonstrated he was not crazy by shaking the fever from him and agreeing not to go to Patagonia.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，他又表明了他实际有多么疯狂，因为他主动立契约把私人财产转给他的家人，包括塔尔沃特套房的十英亩土地、房子、谷仓、附属建筑物以及水权。而且他还把银行里的八百美元也交了出来，那可是他从失事财富中抢救出的存了很长时间的钱。但正是因为这一点，他的家人就没理由把他送进收容所了，因为一旦把他送进收容所，一定会让他所做的一切都无效。</td>
		<td class="en">Next, he demonstrated how crazy he really was, by deeding over to his family, unsolicited, the ten acres on Tarwater Flat, the house, barn, outbuildings, and water-rights.Also did he turn over the eight hundred dollars in bank that was the long-saved salvage of his wrecked fortune.But for this the family found no cause for committal to the asylum, since such committal would necessarily invalidate what he had done.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“爷爷一定是不高兴了。”玛丽说。玛丽是他的大女儿，当她父亲戒烟的时候，她已经当奶奶了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Grandfather is sure peeved,” said Mary, his oldest daughter, herself a grandmother, when her father quit smoking.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他留给自己的所有东西就是几匹老马、一辆山地四轮马车，和拥挤房屋中的一间房。而且，他说过自己对他们没有义务，除了递送美国邮件的合同义务，每星期两次，得从凯尔特维尔翻过塔尔沃特山到达旧阿尔马登——那是一个在高地养牛区里间歇性开发过的水银矿。他就跟他的老马，每周两次地往返于这段路程。而且十年来，不论晴雨，他从没耽误过一次。而且他也从来没有落下每周给玛丽的伙食费用。这个伙食费是他坚持要给的，即使是在巴塔哥尼亚狂热症恢复期间，他都按时照付，虽然为了付这笔钱他得戒烟。</td>
		<td class="en">All he had retained for himself was a span of old horses, a mountain buckboard, and his one room in the crowded house.Further, having affirmed that he would be beholden to none of them, he got the contract to carry the United States mail, twice a week, from Kelterville up over Tarwater Mountain to Old Almaden—which was a sporadically worked quick-silver mine in the upland cattle country.With his old horses it took all his time to make the two weekly round trips.And for ten years, rain or shine, he had never missed a trip.Nor had he failed once to pay his week’s board into Mary’s hand.This board he had insisted on, in the convalescence from his Patagonian fever, and he had paid it strictly, though he had given up tobacco in order to be able to do it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈！”他向这台老旧的塔尔沃特磨坊里毁坏的水车倾诉过心事。这座旧磨坊是他用建筑用材做的，而且还给第一批定居者磨过面粉。“哈！只要我还能养活自己，他们永远不会把我放到这个贫瘠的农场上的。而且我名下没有任何钱财，没有哪个律师会来帮我打官司。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Huh!” he confided to the ruined water wheel of the old Tarwater Mill, which he had built from the standing timber and which had ground wheat for the first settlers.“Huh!They’ll never put me in the poor farm so long as I support myself.And without a penny to my name it ain’t likely any lawyer fellows’ll come snoopin’ around after me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，恰恰因为这些高度合理的行为，人们认为约翰·塔尔沃特有些疯癫了！</td>
		<td class="en">And yet, precisely because of these highly rational acts, it was held that John Tarwater was mildly crazy!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他第一次唱“像古代的阿格斯”这段，是在1849年，那时他二十二岁，正狂热地追逐着想去加利福尼亚的念头。他卖掉了在密歇根的二百四十英亩土地，其中有四十英亩是开发过的，总共只卖得了四头带轭的牛和一驾四轮马车，然后他就开始驾车穿越大平原。</td>
		<td class="en">The first time he had lifted the chant of “Like Argus of the Ancient Times,” had been in 1849, when, twenty-two years’ of age, violently attacked by the Californian fever, he had sold two hundred and forty Michigan acres, forty of it cleared, for the price of four yoke of oxen, and a wagon, and had started across the Plains.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“然后我们在霍尔堡改变了方向，在那儿俄勒冈的移民往北走，我们则向南驶往加利福尼亚。”他讲述那段艰苦旅程时总结道。而比尔·平和我过去常常在萨克拉门托山谷里，用绳索捕猎藏在卡什沼矮灌木丛中的灰熊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And we turned off at Fort Hall, where the Oregon emigration went north’ard, and swung south for Californy,” was his way of concluding the narrative of that arduous journey.And Bill Ping and me used to rope grizzlies out of the underbrush of Cache Slough in the Sacramento Valley.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来的几年他一直运送货物和挖矿山，用从默塞德矿区得到的资金，他满足了自己所在种族占有土地的欲望，并在索诺马县定居下来。</td>
		<td class="en">Years of freighting and mining had followed, and, with a stake gleaned from the Merced placers, he satisfied the land-hunger of his race and time by settling in Sonoma County.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在送信的十年间，他的脚步遍及塔尔沃特镇、塔尔沃特山谷和塔尔沃特山，而这其中的大部分土地都曾属于他，他也一直梦想着在他离世之前，再赢回这些土地。他高大、憔悴的身躯要比几年前更为挺拔，一双小眼睛间距很窄，里面闪耀着蓝色的光芒。此刻，他又唱起了那段古老的歌曲。</td>
		<td class="en">During the ten years of carrying the mail across Tarwater Township, up Tarwater Valley, and over Tarwater Mountain, most all of which land had once been his, he had spent his time dreaming of winning back that land before he died.And now, his huge gaunt form more erect than it had been for years, with a glinting of blue fires in his small and close-set eyes, he was lifting his ancient chant again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“又来了——听他唱。”威廉·塔尔沃特说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“There he goes now—listen to him,” said William Tarwater.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“家里没人。”哈里斯·托平笑道，他是家里的临时工、安妮·塔尔沃特的丈夫和她九个孩子的父亲。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nobody at home,” laughed Harris Topping, day labourer, husband of Annie Tarwater, and father of her nine children.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >厨房的门开了，老人走进来，他刚喂完马回来。歌声已经停止；但是玛丽开始生气了，因为她烧伤了手，而孙子也把稀释过的牛奶吐了一地。</td>
		<td class="en">The kitchen door opened to admit the old man, returning from feeding his horses.The song had ceased from his lips; but Mary was irritable from a burnt hand and a grandchild whose stomach refused to digest properly diluted cows’ milk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在你继续这样已经没用了，父亲，”她说他，“再去克朗代克那样的地方，对你已经不合适了，而且唱歌不会给你带来任何东西。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now there ain’t no use you carryin’ on that way, father,” she tackled him.“The time’s past for you to cut and run for a place like the Klondike, and singing won’t buy you nothing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是一样的，”他平静地答道，“我打赌，我能再到克朗代克那块地方，淘到足够的金子买回塔尔沃特的土地。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Just the same,” he answered quietly.“I bet I could go to that Klondike place and pick up enough gold to buy back the Tarwater lands.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老糊涂！”安妮说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Old fool!” Annie contributed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“少于三十万你是买不回那些土地的。”威廉努力让他冷静下来。</td>
		<td class="en">“You couldn’t buy them back for less’n three hundred thousand and then some,” was William’s effort at squelching him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但只要我能到那儿，就至少可以挣到三十万。”老人平静地反驳道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Then I could pick up three hundred thousand, and then some, if I was only there,” the old man retorted placidly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“感谢老天你不可能徒步走到那儿，否则你真会这么干，我知道的。”玛丽喊道，“海上旅行是要花钱的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Thank God you can’t walk there, or you’d be startin’, I know,” Mary cried.“Ocean travel costs money.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我过去有钱。”她父亲低声下气地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I used to have money,” her father said humbly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但你现在一点儿钱都没有了——所以忘了这件事吧。”威廉建议道，“都是过去的事了，就像曾经和比尔·平用绳索捉熊一样。现在也没熊了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, you ain’t got any now—so forget it,” William advised.“Them times is past, like roping bear with Bill Ping.There ain’t no more bear.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“都是一样的——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Just the same—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是玛丽打断了他。她从厨房的桌子上抓过今天的报纸，粗鲁地在她年迈的父亲鼻子底下挥舞着。</td>
		<td class="en">But Mary cut him off.Seizing the day’s paper from the kitchen table, she flourished it savagely under her aged progenitor’s nose.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那些克朗代克人说什么了？这上面清清楚楚地写着呢。只有血气方刚的年轻人才能受得了克朗代克地区的天气。那里的天气比北极的还恶劣。他们把大批死去的同伴留在了那里。看看他们的照片。你比他们当中年纪最大的都要大上四十岁。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What do those Klondikers say?There it is in cold print.Only the young and robust can stand the Klondike.It’s worse than the north pole.And they’ve left their dead a-plenty there themselves.Look at their pictures.You’re forty years older ’n the oldest of them.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰·塔尔沃特还真看了起来，但是他的目光游移到了引人入胜的头版照片上。</td>
		<td class="en">John Tarwater did look, but his eyes strayed to other photographs on the highly sensational front page.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看看他们敲落金砖的照片，”他说，“我对金子了解得很。我不是从默塞德挣过两万吗？如果不是那场突如其来的大暴雨冲毁了我的翼堤，我会挣不到十万吗？现在，只要我在克朗代克——”</td>
		<td class="en">“And look at the photys of them nuggets they brought down,” he said.“I know gold.Didn’t I gopher twenty thousand outa the Merced?And wouldn’t it a-ben a hundred thousand if that cloudburst hadn’t busted my wing-dam?Now if I was only in the Klondike—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“完全疯了。”威廉对着其余的人公开嘲笑道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Crazy as a loon,” William sneered in open aside to the rest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“跟你父亲说话要礼貌些，”老塔尔沃特温和地责备说，“如果我那样跟我父亲说话，他会用木棍打得我鼻青脸肿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A nice way to talk to your father,” Old Man Tarwater censured mildly.“My father’d have walloped the tar out of me with a single-tree if I’d spoke to him that way.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是你真的疯了，父亲——”威廉开始说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“But you ARE crazy, father—” William began.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“估计你是对的，儿子。这点倒是我父亲还明白的地方。他肯定会揍你。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Reckon you’re right, son.And that’s where my father wasn’t crazy.He’d a-done it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老家伙正在读一些杂志上的文章，说的是四十岁以后的成功男人。”安妮嘲笑道。</td>
		<td class="en">“The old man’s been reading some of them magazine articles about men who succeeded after forty,” Annie jibed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么不可以呢，安妮？”老人问道，“为什么一个男人在他七十岁之后，就不能成功呢？我今年才七十岁。而且如果我可以去克朗代克的话，也许我可以成功——”</td>
		<td class="en">“And why not, daughter?” he asked.“And why can’t a man succeed after he’s seventy?I was only seventy this year.And mebbe I could succeed if only I could get to the Klondike—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是你不可以去。”玛丽打断了他。</td>
		<td class="en">“Which you ain’t going to get to,” Mary shut him off.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，嗯，那么，”他叹气道，“既然我不能，我也只能去睡觉了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, well, then,” he sighed, “seein’s I ain’t, I might just as well go to bed.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他站了起来，身子高大憔悴，骨骼硬朗，而且关节突出，饱经人间沧桑。他参差不齐的头发和胡须不再是灰白，而是雪白了，就跟长在他宽大瘦削的手指背上的一撮撮毛发一样。他走向门口，打开门，叹了口气，又停下来回头看了一眼。</td>
		<td class="en">He stood up, tall, gaunt, great-boned and gnarled, a splendid ruin of a man.His ragged hair and whiskers were not grey but snowy white, as were the tufts of hair that stood out on the backs of his huge bony fingers.He moved toward the door, opened it, sighed, and paused with a backward look.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还是一样的，”他哀伤地低语道，“我的脚底板还是痒得很。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Just the same,” he murmured plaintively, “the bottoms of my feet is itching something terrible.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >早在第二天全家人热闹起来之前，老塔尔沃特就已经打着灯笼喂了马，整理好了马具，做好了早饭。在油灯下吃过饭后他就走了，经过塔尔沃特山谷，前往凯尔特维尔。自从签下邮差合同后，这段寻常的路程他已经走过一千零四十次了，但是这回有两点不寻常。他没有驾车前往凯尔特维尔，而是在主路换了方向，往南去了圣罗莎。甚至比这更值得注意的是，放在他两脚间用纸包着的包裹。包裹里有一套体面的黑色套装，玛丽有很长时间都不愿再看他穿这套衣服了，不是因为衣服破旧，而是因为，就如他猜的那样，玛丽在内心深处认为他下葬时穿这套衣服才够体面。</td>
		<td class="en">Long before the family stirred next morning, his horses fed and harnessed by lantern light, breakfast cooked and eaten by lamp fight, Old Man Tarwater was off and away down Tarwater Valley on the road to Kelterville.Two things were unusual about this usual trip which he had made a thousand and forty times since taking the mail contract.He did not drive to Kelterville, but turned off on the main road south to Santa Rosa.Even more remarkable than this was the paper-wrapped parcel between his feet.It contained his one decent black suit, which Mary had been long reluctant to see him wear any more, not because it was shabby, but because, as he guessed what was at the back of her mind, it was decent enough to bury him in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在圣罗莎一个二手衣服商店，他立马就卖了这套衣服，得到二点五美元。同样从这个乐于助人的店主手里，他卖了他过世很久的妻子的婚戒，得了四美元。他还处理掉了那些马匹跟那辆四轮马车，卖了七十五美元，但只拿到了二十五美元的现金。他在街上偶然碰到了奥尔顿·格兰杰，之前约翰从没向奥尔顿提过在1874年借给他的十美元，这次他跟奥尔顿提起了这件小事，奥尔顿立马就还给了他。而且，在最不可能将来会阔绰的人中，他找到了镇上的酒鬼，约翰在过去阔绰时曾经给他买过很多酒。约翰·塔尔沃特从酒鬼那里借了一美元。最终，约翰坐上了下午去往旧金山的火车。</td>
		<td class="en">And at Santa Rosa, in a second-hand clothes shop, he sold the suit outright for two dollars and a half.From the same obliging shopman he received four dollars for the wedding ring of his long- dead wife.The span of horses and the wagon he disposed of for seventy-five dollars, although twenty-five was all he received down in cash.Chancing to meet Alton Granger on the street, to whom never before had he mentioned the ten dollars loaned him in ’74, he reminded Alton Granger of the little affair, and was promptly paid.Also, of all unbelievable men to be in funds, he so found the town drunkard for whom he had bought many a drink in the old and palmy days.And from him John Tarwater borrowed a dollar.Finally, he took the afternoon train to San Francisco.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >十二天之后，带着一个半空的帆布包，包里装着毯子和旧衣服，他登上了戴依海滩，此时正是克朗代克淘金潮最火热的时刻。海滩上叫喊声撕心裂肺，一片混乱。万吨重的设备散乱地堆在海滩上，由两万人操作着，场面喧嚣热闹。货物由印度航船运过来，越过奇尔库特到达莱克林德曼后，其价钱就从每磅十六美分涨到了三十美分，这样就是每吨六百美元。而亚寒带的冬天马上就要来了。所有人都知道这点，也都知道他们两万人中，只有很少人能跨过这个关口，剩下的只能留在这里，等待晚春来临时的冰雪消融。</td>
		<td class="en">A dozen days later, carrying a half-empty canvas sack of blankets and old clothes, he landed on the beach of Dyea in the thick of the great Klondike Rush.The beach was screaming bedlam.Ten thousand tons of outfit lay heaped and scattered, and twice ten thousand men struggled with it and clamoured about it.Freight, by Indian-back, over Chilcoot to Lake Linderman, had jumped from sixteen to thirty cents a pound, which latter was a rate of six hundred dollars a ton.And the sub-arctic winter gloomed near at hand.All knew it, and all knew that of the twenty thousand of them very few would get across the passes, leaving the rest to winter and wait for the late spring thaw.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这就是老约翰·塔尔沃特踏上的沙滩。他跨过这个沙滩，沿着一条通向奇尔库特的小路向前走着，高声笑唱起了那段古老的歌谣，他自己就像一位阿格斯爷爷，不用担心这世上装备的问题，因为他也没有任何装备。那晚，他就睡在离戴依海滩五英里远的平原上，就在导航独木舟的前方。戴依河从冰山上的黑暗山谷中喷涌而出，在这里变成了一条汹涌的山洪，远处的冰山正是山洪的来源。</td>
		<td class="en">Such the beach old John Tarwater stepped upon; and straight across the beach and up the trail toward Chilcoot he headed, cackling his ancient chant, a very Grandfather Argus himself, with no outfit worry in the world, for he did not possess any outfit.That night he slept on the flats, five miles above Dyea, at the head of canoe navigation.Here the Dyea River became a rushing mountain torrent, plunging out of a dark canyon from the glaciers that fed it far above.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天一大早，他在这里看到了一个体重不过百的矮个子男人，蹒跚地走在一条只有脚那么宽的木头上，背上背着一百多磅重的面粉。而且，他还看到这个矮个子男人在木头桥上绊倒了，脸朝下掉进一个静静的涡流中，涡流的水有两英尺深，而他眼看就要无声无息地被淹死了。他并不想就这么死去，但是背上的面粉跟他差不多重，让他无法起来。</td>
		<td class="en">And here, early next morning, he beheld a little man weighing no more than a hundred, staggering along a foot-log under all of a hundred pounds of flour strapped on his back.Also, he beheld the little man stumble off the log and fall face-downward in a quiet eddy where the water was two feet deep and proceed quietly to drown.It was no desire of his to take death so easily, but the flour on his back weighed as much as he and would not let him up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谢谢您，老先生。”当塔尔沃特把他从水里拖上岸后，他对塔尔沃特说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Thank you, old man,” he said to Tarwater, when the latter had dragged him up into the air and ashore.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在他解开鞋带，把水倒出时，他们攀谈了起来。接着，他摸出一枚十美元的金币，给他的救命恩人。</td>
		<td class="en">While he unlaced his shoes and ran the water out, they had further talk.Next, he fished out a ten-dollar gold-piece and offered it to his rescuer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老塔尔沃特摇了摇头，打了个冷颤，因为刚才冰冷的河水一直浸湿到了他的膝盖。</td>
		<td class="en">Old Tarwater shook his head and shivered, for the ice-water had wet him to his knees.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是我想，我是不会拒绝坐下来和您共进友好一餐的。</td>
		<td class="en">“But I reckon I wouldn’t object to settin’ down to a friendly meal with you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您还没用过早餐吗？”这个矮个子真诚而好奇地瞟了他一眼问道。他年纪在四十岁以上，并说自己叫安森。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ain’t had breakfast?” the little man, who was past forty and who had said his name was Anson, queried with a glance frankly curious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一口也没吃。”约翰·塔尔沃特回答道。</td>
