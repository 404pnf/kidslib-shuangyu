		<td class="en">CHAPTER I</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >穿过这片森林可以少走一英里的路程。辛森在经过铁匠铺时机械地拐了过去，拨开了田间栅门。铁匠和他的伙计静止地站在那儿，看着这个不速之客。但是辛森看起来太过绅士，这使得他们无法和他搭讪。就这样，铁匠和他的伙计沉默地看着辛森穿过这片地，进入了森林。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a mile nearer through the wood.Mechanically, Syson turned up by the forge and lifted the field-gate.The blacksmith and his mate stood still, watching the trespasser.But Syson looked too much a gentleman to be accosted.They let him go in silence across the small field to the wood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这天早晨和六年或八年前那些春天的早晨没有丝毫不同，还是那样清新明亮。白色和黄棕色的鸡依旧在栅门周围刨土，弄得遍地都是鸡毛和刨出的脏东西。矮树篱中有两簇浓密的冬青灌木，而这两簇灌木之间有一个隐蔽的缺口。人们可以翻过这个篱笆进入森林。而篱笆上的木条和之前一样被守林人踩得满是痕迹。他终于回来了。</td>
		<td class="en">There was not the least difference between this morning and those of the bright springs, six or eight years back.White and sandy-gold fowls still scratched round the gate, littering the earth and the field with feathers and scratched-up rubbish.Between the two thick holly bushes in the wood-hedge was the hidden gap, whose fence one climbed to get into the wood; the bars were scored just the same by the keeper’s boots.He was back in the eternal.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森高兴极了。他像个不安的幽灵回到了以往生活过的村庄，他发觉这里一直在等着他，一点也没有变。榛树依旧欢快地向下伸展着它的小手。在葱郁的青草间，在灌木的树阴下，风铃草还是那样柔弱、稀疏。</td>
		<td class="en">Syson was extraordinarily glad.Like an uneasy spirit he had returned to the country of his past, and he found it waiting for him, unaltered.The hazel still spread glad little hands downwards, the bluebells here were still wan and few, among the lush grass and in shade of the bushes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在山坡的顶部，有条小路穿过丛林，一度蜿蜒至很远。周边是枝繁叶茂的橡树，展示着它们的金贵。一丛丛的车叶草、一片片的山毛榉和一簇簇的风信子把地面装饰成了美丽的菱形拼图。两棵倒下的树依旧横躺在小路上。辛森摇摇晃晃地走下一个陡峭崎岖的山坡，再一次来到一片空地。此刻从这里往北望去，就好像透过丛林里的一扇大窗户看过去一样。他停在那儿，目光掠过山顶的平地，凝望着村庄。那村庄点缀着光秃秃的高地，就好像是从过往的工业货车上颠下来，被遗弃在这儿似的。那里有一座笔挺的、洋溢着现代风格的灰色小教堂。红色的住房纵横交错，散落其中。村庄后部，矿井的井架闪闪发亮，矿山若隐若现。户外的一切都赤裸裸的，连一棵树也没有！那里真是一点也没有变。</td>
		<td class="en">The path through the wood, on the very brow of a slope, ran winding easily for a time.All around were twiggy oaks, just issuing their gold, and floor spaces diapered with woodruff, with patches of dog-mercury and tufts of hyacinth.Two fallen trees still lay across the track.Syson jolted down a steep, rough slope, and came again upon the open land, this time looking north as through a great window in the wood.He stayed to gaze over the level fields of the hill-top, at the village which strewed the bare upland as if it had tumbled off the passing waggons of industry, and been forsaken.There was a stiff, modern, grey little church, and blocks and rows of red dwellings lying at random; at the back, the twinkling headstocks of the pit, and the looming pit-hill.All was naked and out-of-doors, not a tree!It was quite unaltered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森满意地转过身，沿着这条通往山下的小路向森林走去。莫名其妙地，他得意起来，感觉自己又回到了永恒的梦幻中。突然，他如梦初醒，吃了一惊。一位守林人正站在前面几码远的地方，挡住了去路。</td>
		<td class="en">Syson turned, satisfied, to follow the path that sheered downhill into the wood.He was curiously elated, feeling himself back in an enduring vision.He started.A keeper was standing a few yards in front, barring the way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“先生，您走这条路是要去哪里？”那个男人问道。语气中带着挑衅的意味。辛森用冷淡而又敏锐的目光注视着这个家伙。这是一位二十四五岁的年轻人，脸色红润，面容俊俏。一双深蓝色眼睛正盛气凌人地盯着这位入侵者。他乌黑浓密的胡须剪得很短，下面是一张小巧、极柔软的嘴。无论从哪方面来看，这小伙子都很有男人味，很帅气。他中等个头，前胸健壮突出，身体挺得笔直而又充满自信，神态悠然自得。这一切都给人一种充满野性的感觉，就像喷泉为使自己保持内在的平衡而喷射出的一股急流。他站在那儿，枪托支在地上，用不确定而审视的眼神看着辛森。这个外来者则用黑黑的、转个不停的眼睛审视着这个男人，洞察着他，完全无视他的职权。这使守林人不安起来，脸也变得通红。</td>
		<td class="en">“Where might you be going this road, sir?” asked the man.The tone of his question had a challenging twang.Syson looked at the fellow with an impersonal, observant gaze.It was a young man of four or five and twenty, ruddy and well favoured.His dark blue eyes now stared aggressively at the intruder.His black moustache, very thick, was cropped short over a small, rather soft mouth.In every other respect the fellow was manly and good-looking.He stood just above middle height; the strong forward thrust of his chest, and the perfect ease of his erect, self-sufficient body, gave one the feeling that he was taut with animal life, like the thick jet of a fountain balanced in itself.He stood with the butt of his gun on the ground, looking uncertainly and questioningly at Syson.The dark, restless eyes of the trespasser, examining the man and penetrating into him without heeding his office, troubled the keeper and made him flush.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“内勒在哪儿？你接了他的工作？”辛森问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Where is Naylor?Have you got his job?” Syson asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不是从豪斯来的，对吗？”守林人问道。那是不可能的，因为那里的人早就搬走了。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re not from the House, are you?” inquired the keeper.It could not be, since everyone was away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，我不是从豪斯来的。”辛森答道。好像有意戏弄他似的。</td>
		<td class="en">“No, I’m not from the House,” the other replied.It seemed to amuse him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么我可否问一下你要去哪儿呢？”守林人愤愤地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Then might I ask where you were making for?” said the keeper, nettled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我要去哪儿呢？”辛森重复道。“我要去威利－瓦特农场。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Where I am making for?” Syson repeated.“I am going to Willey–Water Farm.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是这条路。”</td>
		<td class="en">“This isn’t the road.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我觉得是。沿着这条路一直走，路过一口井，然后从白门出去。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think so.Down this path, past the well, and out by the white gate.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但那可不是公路。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But that’s not the public road.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也认为那不是。我都忘了，内勒在这儿的时候，我经常走这条路。顺便问一句，内勒在哪儿？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I suppose not.I used to come so often, in Naylor’s time, I had forgotten.Where is he, by the way?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“得了风湿病，瘸了。”守林人不情愿地回应道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Crippled with rheumatism,” the keeper answered reluctantly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是吗？”辛森痛苦地惊呼道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is he?”Syson exclaimed in pain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你是谁啊？”守林人换了一种语调问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“And who might you be?” asked the keeper, with a new intonation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“约翰·阿德利·辛森，我以前住在考迪莱恩。”</td>
		<td class="en">“John Adderley Syson; I used to live in Cordy Lane.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“以前追求过希尔达·米勒希普？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Used to court Hilda Millership?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森睁大双眼，脸上露出一丝痛苦的微笑。他点了点头。接着是一阵令人别扭的沉默。</td>
		<td class="en">Syson’s eyes opened with a pained smile.He nodded.There was an awkward silence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么你——你是谁啊？”辛森问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“And you—who are you?” asked Syson.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“阿瑟·佩尔比姆——内勒是我的叔叔。”守林人说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Arthur Pilbeam—Naylor’s my uncle,” said the other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你就住在纳托尔这里吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You live here in Nuttall?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我现在就住在我叔叔家——内勒家。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m lodgin’ at my uncle’s—at Naylor’s.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我明白了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“I see!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你说过要到威利－瓦特去？”守林人问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did you say you was goin’ down to Willey–Water?” asked the keeper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两人停顿了片刻之后，守林人突然说：“我正在追求希尔达·米勒希普。”</td>
		<td class="en">There was a pause of some moments, before the keeper blurted: “I’M courtin’ Hilda Millership.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位年轻人充满敌意但又几乎是同情地看着这位不速之客。辛森眼前一亮。</td>
		<td class="en">The young fellow looked at the intruder with a stubborn defiance, almost pathetic.Syson opened new eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是吗？”辛森惊讶地问。守林人变得满脸通红。</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you?” he said, astonished.The keeper flushed dark.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我和她正在交往。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“She and me are keeping company,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我居然不知道！”辛森说。守林人不自在地等着对方继续说下去。</td>
		<td class="en">“I didn’t know!” said Syson.The other man waited uncomfortably.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这事，定好了吗？”不速之客问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What, is the thing settled?” asked the intruder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么，定好了？”守林人愠怒地反驳道。</td>
		<td class="en">“How, settled?” retorted the other sulkily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们很快就要结婚了吗，有没有诸如此类的事？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you going to get married soon, and all that?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >守林人沉默地凝视了一段时间，一副无奈的样子。</td>
		<td class="en">The keeper stared in silence for some moments, impotent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想是的。”他满怀怨恨地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I suppose so,” he said, full of resentment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢！”辛森仔细地注视着他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah!” Syson watched closely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >过了一会儿，辛森补充道：“我已经结婚了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m married myself,” he added, after a time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你结婚了？”守林人怀疑地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“You are?” said the other incredulously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森响亮而又凄然地笑了笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Syson laughed in his brilliant, unhappy way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“十五个月之前。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“This last fifteen months,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >守林人睁大双眼，用疑惑的眼神瞪着他，显然在回想过去，试图把事情弄清楚。</td>
		<td class="en">The keeper gazed at him with wide, wondering eyes, apparently thinking back, and trying to make things out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么，难道你不知道吗？”辛森问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, didn’t you know?” asked Syson.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，我不知道。”守林人绷着脸说。</td>
		<td class="en">“No, I didn’t,” said the other sulkily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来是一阵沉默。</td>
		<td class="en">There was silence for a moment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，好了！”辛森说道，“我要继续赶路了。我想我可以走吧。”对面的守林人一声不吭地站在那儿。两人在这片绿草茵茵的开阔地上迟疑不决。周围是一束束茁壮成长的风铃草，这一小片开阔地就位于山的坡顶。辛森犹豫地往前走了几步，然后又停了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah well!” said Syson, “I will go on. I suppose I may.”The keeper stood in silent opposition.The two men hesitated in the open, grassy space, set around with small sheaves of sturdy bluebells; a little open platform on the brow of the hill.Syson took a few indecisive steps forward, then stopped.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我说，这里真漂亮！”他喊道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I say, how beautiful!” he cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >整个山坡的景色他已尽收眼底。宽宽的道路像一条小河从他的脚下延伸出去。除了守林人在路中央踏出的绿色羊肠小径外，路上长满了风铃草。这条路就像一条小溪，通往水边蔚蓝的浅滩。那里生长着丛丛簇簇的风铃草。绿色的羊肠小径依然从风铃草中穿过，像一条窄窄的冰水流过蓝色的湖面。一片阴影斑驳的碧蓝徜徉在灌木的紫色枝条下，仿佛花朵越过林地，卧在水中。</td>
		<td class="en">He had come in full view of the downslope.The wide path ran from his feet like a river, and it was full of bluebells, save for a green winding thread down the centre, where the keeper walked.Like a stream the path opened into azure shallows at the levels, and there were pools of bluebells, with still the green thread winding through, like a thin current of ice-water through blue lakes.And from under the twig-purple of the bushes swam the shadowed blue, as if the flowers lay in flood water over the woodland.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，这里多美啊！”辛森惊呼道。这就是他的过去，他曾经抛弃的村庄。它的美刺痛了他。林鸽在头顶咕咕地叫着，空气里洋溢着鸟儿们欢快的歌唱。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah, isn’t it lovely!”Syson exclaimed; this was his past, the country he had abandoned, and it hurt him to see it so beautiful.Woodpigeons cooed overhead, and the air was full of the brightness of birds singing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果你结婚了，为什么还一直给她写信，寄给她诗集还有别的东西？” 守林人问道。辛森盯着他，十分震惊并感到羞愧万分。然后他笑了笑。</td>
		<td class="en">“If you’re married, what do you keep writing to her for, and sending her poetry books and things?” asked the keeper.Syson stared at him, taken aback and humiliated.Then he began to smile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，”他说，“我不知道你......”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well,” he said, “I did not know about you...”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >守林人又一次满脸通红。</td>
		<td class="en">Again the keeper flushed darkly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是如果你结婚了——”他指责道。</td>
		<td class="en">“But if you are married—” he charged.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是结婚了。”辛森嘲弄地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am,” answered the other cynically.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后，辛森俯视着这条美丽的青色小路，感到了自己的耻辱。“我又有什么权利抓住她不放？”他痛苦而又妄自菲薄地想着。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, looking down the blue, beautiful path, Syson felt his own humiliation.“What right HAVE I to hang on to her?” he thought, bitterly  self-contemptuous.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她知道我结婚了。”辛森说。</td>
		<td class="en">“She knows I’m married and all that,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是你一直给她寄书。”守林人质疑道。</td>
		<td class="en">“But you keep sending her books,” challenged the keeper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森一声不吭，嘲弄而又半带怜悯地看着这个人。然后，他转过身去。</td>
		<td class="en">Syson, silenced, looked at the other man quizzically, half pitying.Then he turned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再见。”他说道，之后便离开了。现在，一切都使他感到烦躁：两棵阔叶柳，一棵通体金黄色，散发着香气，还发出沙沙声；另一棵泛着银灰色和绿色，长满刺毛。这使他回想起在这里曾经给她讲过花朵授粉的往事。他真是个傻瓜！总是干蠢事！</td>
		<td class="en">“Good day,” he said, and was gone.Now, everything irritated him: the two sallows, one all gold and perfume and murmur, one silver-green and bristly, reminded him, that here he had taught her about pollination.What a fool he was!What god-forsaken folly it all was!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，那么，”　辛森自言自语道，“这个可怜的家伙好像对我心存嫉妒。我会尽力帮他的。”他气急败坏地咧了咧嘴。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah well,” he said to himself; “the poor devil seems to have a grudge against me.I’ll do my best for him.”He grinned to himself, in a very bad temper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二章</td>
		<td class="en">CHAPTER II</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >农场离林边不到一百码远。树墙构成了这个开阔的四方形庭院的第四面墙。房屋面朝树林。怀着复杂的心情，辛森留意到李子花散落在长势茂盛、色彩缤纷的樱草花上。这些樱草花还是他亲手种在这里的。如今它们长得多茂盛啊！李子树下长着丛丛簇簇的樱草花，有大红色的、粉红色的、还有淡紫色的。辛森看见有人透过厨房的窗子扫了他一眼，还听到男人们的说话声。</td>
		<td class="en">The farm was less than a hundred yards from the wood’s edge.The wall of trees formed the fourth side to the open quadrangle.The house faced the wood.With tangled emotions, Syson noted the plum blossom falling on the profuse, coloured primroses, which he himself had brought here and set.How they had increased!There were thick tufts of scarlet, and pink, and pale purple primroses under the plum trees.He saw somebody glance at him through the kitchen window, heard men’s voices.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >房门突然打开了：她俨然已经出落成一个大姑娘了！他感到自己面色发白。</td>
		<td class="en">The door opened suddenly: very womanly she had grown!He felt himself going pale.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是？——阿迪！”她惊呼道，一动不动地呆站在那儿。</td>
		<td class="en">“You?—Addy!” she exlaimed, and stood motionless.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁啊？”农夫喊道。接着是男人们低沉的声音。那些低沉的声音，好奇而又几乎带着嘲弄，使这位访客心生痛楚。辛森在那儿等着，冲着她灿烂地微笑。</td>
		<td class="en">“Who?” called the farmer’s voice.Men’s low voices answered.Those low voices, curious and almost jeering, roused the tormented spirit in the visitor.Smiling brilliantly at her, he waited.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我——为什么不是呢？”他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Myself—why not?” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她脸红了，一直红到面颊和脖根。</td>
		<td class="en">The flush burned very deep on her cheek and throat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们马上就要吃完饭了。”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“We are just finishing dinner,” she said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那我在外面呆着。”他示意自己会坐在门旁的红色陶桶上。这桶伫立在水仙花丛中，里面还装着饮用水。</td>
		<td class="en">“Then I will stay outside.”He made a motion to show that he would sit on the red earthenware pipkin that stood near the door among the daffodils, and contained the drinking water.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，不要，进来吧。”她急忙说道。辛森跟着她走进去。在门口，辛森迅速地瞥了这家人一眼，并鞠躬行礼。在场的每个人都很困惑。农夫、他的妻子，还有四个儿子坐在餐桌旁。餐桌上胡乱摆放着些盘碟，男人们的衣袖一直挽到胳膊肘的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh no, come in,” she said hurriedly.He followed her.In the doorway, he glanced swiftly over the family, and bowed.Everyone was confused.The farmer, his wife, and the four sons sat at the coarsely laid dinner-table, the men with arms bare to the elbows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“非常抱歉在午餐时间来打搅你们。”辛森说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am sorry I come at lunch-time,” said Syson.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好，阿迪！”农夫说道，尽管用的是以前的称呼，可是语调冷淡。“你好吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hello, Addy!” said the farmer, assuming the old form of address, but his tone cold.“How are you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他和辛森握了手。</td>
		<td class="en">And he shook hands.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你要吃点吗？”他邀请这位年轻的访客，但想当然地认为他会被拒绝。他断定辛森已变得相当讲究，吃不下这粗茶淡饭。年轻人对这种责难感到畏缩。</td>
		<td class="en">“Shall you have a bit?” he invited the young visitor, but taking for granted the offer would be refused.He assumed that Syson was become too refined to eat so roughly.The young man winced at the imputation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你吃过饭了吗？”女儿问道。　</td>
		<td class="en">“Have you had any dinner?” asked the daughter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有。”辛森回答道，“现在太早了。我一点半的时候就回去。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” replied Syson.“It is too early.I shall be back at half-past one.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你叫它午餐，是吗？”大儿子近乎讽刺地问道。他曾是辛森，这位年轻人的密友。</td>
		<td class="en">“You call it lunch, don’t you?”  asked the eldest son, almost ironical.He had once been an intimate friend of this young man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“等我们吃完后，会给阿迪些吃的。”病弱的母亲反对道。</td>
		<td class="en">“We’ll give Addy something when we’ve finished,” said the mother, an invalid, deprecating.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不——不用麻烦。我不想给你们添任何麻烦。”辛森说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“No—don’t trouble.I don’t want to give you any trouble,” said Syson.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你就靠这新鲜的空气和美丽的景色过活吧！”十九岁的小儿子笑着说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You could allus live on fresh air an’ scenery,” laughed the youngest son, a lad of nineteen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森绕过这些房屋，进到屋后的果园里。在那里，沿着树篱生长的水仙花左右摇荡，就像栖息在树枝上竖起羽毛的黄色鸟儿一样。他特别喜爱这个地方。这里山峦环绕，熊皮似的树林遍布于它们的谷肩之上，小小的红色农场像胸针一样别在它们的外衣上；山谷间流淌着一股蓝色的清泉，家用牧场则是光秃秃的，鸟儿们叽叽喳喳地唱着，虽然通常没有人会听。即使到他生命的最后一刻，他都会梦到这里，感受洒向面颊的阳光，欣赏冬日细枝间的几捧白雪，或者闻闻春天来临的气息。</td>

		<td class="en">Syson looked at her.He was startled to see his young love, his nun, his Botticelli angel, so revealed.It was he who had been the fool.He and she were more separate than any two strangers could be.She only wanted to keep up a correspondence with him—and he, of course, wanted it kept up, so that he could write to her, like Dante to some Beatrice who had never existed save in the man’s own brain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在小路的尽头，希尔达离开了辛森。于是，他和守林人一起走向开阔地，走向林边的大门。两人几乎像朋友一样地走着。他们并不表露各自心中的想法。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森并未径直走向大路口，而是沿着林边走。溪水蔓延到一片小沼泽；桤木树下、芦苇丛中，一大株一大株金黄色的万寿菊在阳光下闪耀着。棕色的溪流如缕缕丝线流淌着，与花朵的金黄色交相辉映。突然空中一道蓝光闪现，有一只翠鸟飞过。</td>
		<td class="en">Instead of going straight to the high-road gate, Syson went along the wood’s edge, where the brook spread out in a little bog, and under the alder trees, among the reeds, great yellow stools and bosses of marigolds shone.Threads of brown water trickled by, touched with gold from the flowers.Suddenly there was a blue flash in the air, as a kingfisher passed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森格外感动。他爬上河岸来到荆豆丛中，零星的花朵尚未簇拥成花的海洋。辛森躺在褐色的枯草皮上，发现了几小枝紫色的远志和少许粉红的马先蒿。这是一个多么美妙的世界啊——精彩绝伦，总是崭新的。尽管他感觉这仿佛是在地下，像是一成不变的地狱的旷野。他胸中的痛楚就像伤口一样疼痛。他记起了威廉·莫里斯的诗句。诗中描绘了里昂内斯教堂中一位受伤的骑士躺在地上，矛柄深深地刺入他胸膛的情景。他如死去一般躺着，但又没有死，日复一日，斑斓的阳光透过彩色玻璃窗照到圣坛，而后又逝去。他现在知道，他和希尔达之间的事情绝不可能是真的，从来也没有过。真相始终相去甚远。</td>
		<td class="en">Syson was extraordinarily moved.He climbed the bank to the gorse bushes, whose sparks of blossom had not yet gathered into a flame.Lying on the dry brown turf, he discovered sprigs of tiny purple milkwort and pink spots of lousewort.What a wonderful world it was—marvellous, for ever new.He felt as if it were underground, like the fields of monotone hell, notwithstanding.Inside his breast was a pain like a wound.He remembered the poem of William Morris, where in the Chapel of Lyonesse a knight lay wounded, with the truncheon of a spear deep in his breast, lying always as dead, yet did not die, while day after day the coloured sunlight dipped from the painted window across the chancel, and passed away.He knew now it never had been true, that which was between him and her, not for a moment.The truth had stood apart all the time.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >辛森透过灌木丛看过去。希尔达正站在靠近门口的树林之中。守林人在田野里，徘徊于树篱边上，玩弄着那些停在白荆棘花上的蜜蜂。</td>
		<td class="en">Syson looked through the bushes.Hilda was standing in the wood, near the gate.The man was in the field, loitering by the hedge, and playing with the bees as they settled on the white bramble flowers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一阵沉默。辛森此时想象着希尔达的心绪正沉浸在百鸟灵的明快歌声中。突然守林人惊呼“啊！”并咒骂了一声。他正紧紧地抓住外套衣袖靠近肩膀的地方。接着他脱掉夹克，把它扔到了地上，然后聚精会神地把衬衣袖卷到肩膀。</td>
		<td class="en">There was silence for a while, in which Syson imagined her will among the brightness of the larks.Suddenly the keeper exclaimed “Ah!” and swore.He was gripping at the sleeve of his coat, near the shoulder.Then he pulled off his jacket, threw it on the ground, and absorbedly rolled up his shirt sleeve right to the shoulder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊！”他报复似地说，一面捉起蜜蜂并把它丢到一旁。他将纤细光亮的胳膊扭过来，笨拙地朝肩膀上看去。</td>

		<td class="en">When Syson next looked up, at the sound of voices, he saw in the shadow the keeper with his mouth on the throat of his beloved, whose head was thrown back, and whose hair had fallen, so that one rough rope of dark brown hair hung across his bare arm.</td></tr>
