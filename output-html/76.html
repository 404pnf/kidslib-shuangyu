		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天早晨，我和妻子正如往常一样告别。她放下她的第二杯茶，跟随我走到前门。在门口，她从我西服的翻领里扯出一根看不到的线头（这是女人们宣告所有权的普遍行为），并嘱咐我注意感冒。我没有感冒。接着是她的告别吻——那带有雨茶芳香的、充满家庭生活气息的吻。不必担心，她无限延续的习惯里不会有率性而为的、五花八门的新举动。由于长久以来习惯性的失职，她把我那原本端正的领带夹碰歪了。接着，在关门的时候，我听到她大清早拖着拖鞋走回她渐渐变凉的茶边的步履声。</td>
		<td class="en">My wife and I parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner.She left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front door.There she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint (the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership) and bade me to take care of my cold.I had no cold.Next came her kiss of parting—the level kiss of domesticity flavored with Young Hyson.There was no fear of the extemporaneous, of variety spicing her infinite custom.With the deft touch of long malpractice, she dabbed awry my well-set scarf pin; and then, as I closed the door, I heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >出发时，我并没有想过或是预测到接下来将要发生的事。这病来得突然。</td>
		<td class="en">When I set out I had no thought or premonition of what was to occur.The attack came suddenly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >数周以来，我一直在辛苦工作——几乎夜以继日；我在忙一桩轰动一时的铁路诉讼案，结果我大获全胜，这也不过是几天前的事而已。事实上，多年以来，我一直在苦心钻研法律，几乎从没中止过。优秀的沃尔尼医生已经警告过我一两次了。他是我的朋友，也是我的医师。</td>
		<td class="en">For many weeks I had been toiling, almost night and day, at a famous railroad law case that I won triumphantly but a few days previously.In fact, I had been digging away at the law almost without cessation for many years.Once or twice good Doctor Volney, my friend and physician, had warned me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果你不放松下来的话，贝尔福德，”他说道，“你会突然身心崩溃的。要么你的神经会出问题，要么你的大脑会吃不消。告诉我，哪个星期你在报纸上没读到有关失语症的病例？——某个走失的男子，他的过去和身份都无从查起，没名没姓地漂泊——而这一切都是由大脑里的一个小血块引起的，其根源在于工作过度或忧虑。”</td>
		<td class="en">“If you don’t slacken up, Bellford,” he said, “you’ll go suddenly to pieces.Either your nerves or your brain will give way.Tell me, does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case of aphasia—of some man lost, wandering nameless, with his past and his identity blotted out—and all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我总以为，”我说，“那些病例中说的血块其实是在那些报社记者的大脑里找到的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I always thought,” said I, “that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃尔尼医生摇摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">Doctor Volney shook his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这种病确实存在，”他说道，“你需要改变或者休息。法庭、办公室和家——这就是你唯一的出行路线。至于娱乐——对你而言就是读法律书籍。你最好及时听取我的警告。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The disease exists,” he said.“You need a change or a rest.Court-room, office and home—there is the only route you travel.For recreation you—read law books.Better take warning in time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“每周四晚上，”我辩驳道，“我和我妻子玩克里比奇牌戏。每周日，她给我读她母亲的每周来信。法律书籍不是一种消遣，这一说法还有待确证。”</td>
		<td class="en">“On Thursday nights,” I said, defensively, “my wife and I play cribbage.On Sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her mother.That law books are not a recreation remains yet to be established.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天早晨，我一边走着，一边想起了沃尔尼医生的话。我感觉跟往常一样好——也许比平常更加精神焕发。</td>
		<td class="en">That morning as I walked I was thinking of Doctor Volney’s words.I was feeling as well as I usually did—possibly in better spirits than usual.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于在客车那狭窄的座位上睡了很长一段时间，醒来时我浑身僵硬、肌肉抽筋。我把头倚靠在座位上努力地去想。过了很长一段时间后，我对自己说道：“我肯定有个什么名字。”我翻看我的口袋。我没能找到一张卡片、一封信、一张纸或一个姓名首字母组成的花押字。但我却在我外套的口袋里找到了总额近3000美元的大面额钞票。“当然，我肯定是个什么人。”我对自己重复道，然后又一次陷入沉思中。</td>
		<td class="en">I woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious seat of a day coach.I leaned my head against the seat and tried to think.After a long time I said to myself: “I must have a name of some sort.”I searched my pockets.Not a card; not a letter; not a paper or monogram could I find.But I found in my coat pocket nearly $3,000 in bills of large denomination.“I must be some one, of course,” I repeated to myself, and began again to consider.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这趟车挤满了人。我暗自思忖，他们中间一定有着某些共同的爱好，因为他们无拘无束地混在一起，而且似乎心情和精神都极佳。他们中的一员——一个戴着眼镜的精壮的先生，浑身散发出明显的肉桂皮和芦荟的气味——向我友好地点了点头，同时占用了我的半个空位，随即打开了一张报纸。在他读报的间歇里，我们交谈着，像所有旅客那样谈谈当前的时事。我发现自己能够很好地将有关这方面话题的谈话维持下去，至少我的记忆在这样的谈话中还算够用。不久我的同伴说：“你肯定是我们中的一员。这次西部派出了非常多人。我很高兴他们在纽约召开大会；我以前从没去过东部。我名叫R. P. 波尔德——来自密苏里州希科里格罗夫的波尔德父子公司。”</td>
		<td class="en">The car was well crowded with men, among whom, I told myself, there must have been some common interest, for they intermingled freely, and seemed in the best good humor and spirits.One of them—a stout, spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of cinnamon and aloes—took the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod, and unfolded a newspaper.In the intervals between his periods of reading, we conversed, as travelers will, on current affairs.I found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with credit, at least to my memory.By and by my companion said: “You are one of us, of course.”Fine lot of men the West sends in this time.I’m glad they held the convention in New York; I’ve never been East before.My name’s R. P. Bolder—Bolder & Son, of Hickory Grove, Missouri.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管毫无准备，我依然能应付这个紧急情况，就像当人们面对这样的情况时也能如此一样。现在我必须为自己举行一场洗礼，而且同时扮演婴儿、牧师和父母的角色。我的理智前来营救我那慢人一步的大脑。我同伴身上那挥之不去的药味给我提供了一个主意；我瞥了他的报纸一眼，看到了一个显眼的广告，这进一步帮了我。</td>
		<td class="en">Though unprepared, I rose to the emergency, as men will when put to it.Now must I hold a christening, and be at once babe, parson and parent.My senses came to the rescue of my slower brain.The insistent odor of drugs from my companion supplied one idea; a glance at his newspaper, where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement, assisted me further.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我叫爱德华·平卡汉默。”我流利地说，“我是一名药剂师，家住堪萨斯州的科诺普利斯。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My name,” said I, glibly, “is Edward Pinkhammer.I am a druggist, and my home is in Cornopolis, Kansas.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我知道你是一位药剂师，”我的旅伴友好地说，“我看见你右手食指因握碾槌而磨出老茧的地方了。你肯定是我们全国代表大会的一个代表。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I knew you were a druggist,” said my fellow traveler, affably.“I saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs.Of course, you are a delegate to our National Convention.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这些人都是药剂师吗？”我惊讶地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Are all these men druggists?” I asked, wonderingly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，他们都是药剂师。这车从西部开来。他们跟你一样,也是老一代的药剂师——而不是那些用自动贩卖机取代处方桌、专卖药片药粒的成药店伙计。我们自己过滤止痛剂，自己捻药丸，也不会经营糖果和鞋子副业、在春天里卖些花木种子。我告诉你，平卡汉默，在这次大会上，我有一个想法要提出来——他们需要的正是新点子。这么说吧，你知道药架上一瓶瓶的酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠Ant. Et Pot. Tart.和Sod. Et Pot. Tart.——你知道，一个有毒，一个无害。看标签很容易把它们弄混淆。药剂师们通常把它们放在哪儿呢？唉，让它们离得尽可能远，放在不同的药架上。这是错误的。我说，得把它们并排着放，这样的话，当你想要一个时，你总能把它与另一个进行比较，如此一来就可以避免弄错了。你听懂这个主意了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“They are.This car came through from the West.And they’re your old-time druggists, too—none of your patent tablet-and-granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk.We percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills, and we ain’t above handling a few garden seeds in the spring, and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes.I tell you Hampinker, I’ve got an idea to spring on this convention—new ideas is what they want.Now, you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and Rochelle salt Ant. Et Pot. Tart. And Sod. Et Pot. Tart.—one’s poison, you know, and the other’s harmless.It’s easy to mistake one label for the other.Where do druggists mostly keep ’em?Why, as far apart as possible, on different shelves.That’s wrong.I say keep ’em side by side, so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes.Do you catch the idea?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在我看来，这主意很好。”我回答。</td>
		<td class="en">“It seems to me a very good one,” I said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好啊！我在大会上提出这个主意的时候，你要支持啊。那些整天摆弄橙色磷酸盐和按摩膏的东部教授们自以为他们是市场上唯一的锭剂，我们要让他们看起来就像皮下注射剂。”</td>
		<td class="en">“All right!When I spring it on the convention you back it up.We’ll make some of these Eastern orange-phosphate-and-massage-cream professors that think they’re the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果我能提供任何帮助的话，”我热切地说，“那两瓶——呃——”</td>
		<td class="en">“If I can be of any aid,” I said, warming, “the two bottles of—er—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tartrate of antimony and potash, and tartrate of soda and potash.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从此以后应该并排放着。”我语气坚定地总结道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Shall henceforth sit side by side,” I concluded, firmly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，还有另一件事，”波尔德先生说，“制作药丸时，你更喜欢用哪一种赋形剂——碳酸镁还是甘草根粉？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, there’s another thing,” said Mr. Bolder.“For an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer—the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个——呃——镁吧。”我说。这个词比另一个词更好说些。</td>
		<td class="en">“The—er—magnesia,” I said.It was easier to say than the other word.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波尔德先生透过眼镜，猜疑地看了我一眼。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我用甘草，”他说，“镁会结块。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Give me the glycerrhiza,” said he.“Magnesia cakes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这儿又有一个捏造出来的失语症病例，”不一会儿后，他把他的报纸递给我，用手指指着一篇报道说，“我不相信这些。我认为这其中十有八九都是骗人的把戏。一个人厌烦了他的工作和亲人，想去寻个开心罢了。他偷偷溜走，去到某个地方。当他们找到他时，他就假装失忆了——不知道他自己的名字，甚至认不出他妻子左肩上的红色胎记。失语症！啧！为什么他们不能呆在家失忆呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here’s another one of these fake aphasia cases,” he said, presently, handing me his newspaper, and laying his finger upon an article.“I don’t believe in ’em.I put nine out of ten of ’em down as frauds.A man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time.He skips out somewhere, and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memory—don’t know his own name, and won’t even recognize the strawberry mark on his wife’s left shoulder.Aphasia!Tut!Why can’t they stay at home and forget?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我拿过报纸，读了起来。在醒目的标题后，正文如下：“丹佛，6月12日讯。——著名律师埃尔温·C. 贝尔福德三天前从家中神秘失踪，所有查明他下落的努力都付诸东流。贝尔福德先生是拥有极高社会地位的、名声显赫的公民。他的法律业务规模庞大、利润可观。他已婚，有一座精美的住所，还拥有本州最大的私人藏书室。在他失踪的那一天，他从银行里取出了一大笔钱。他离开银行后，再也没有人见过他。贝尔福德先生是一个非常好静并且恋家的人，而且似乎在家里和工作中得到了幸福。几个月来，他一直一心扑在一桩与Q. Y. & Z.铁路公司有关的重要的诉讼案上。如果关于他的离奇失踪有任何线索可循的话，那也许能在这件事情上找到点线索。恐怕过度工作已经影响了他的大脑。目前正在尽一切努力寻找这名失踪男子的下落。”</td>
		<td class="en">I took the paper and read, after the pungent headlines, the following: “ Denver, June 12.—Elwyn C. Bellford, a prominent lawyer, is myseteriously missing from his home since three days ago, and all efforts to locate him have been in vain.Mr. Bellford is a well-known citizen of the highest standing, and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law practice.He is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the State.On the day of his disappearance, he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank.No one can be found who saw him after he left the bank.Mr. Bellford was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes, and seemed to find his happiness in his home and profession.If any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance, it may be found in the fact that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection with the Q. Y. and Z. Railroad Company.It is feared that overwork may have affected his mind.Every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“波尔德先生，在我看来你有点愤世嫉俗啊，”读完这条新闻后我说，“依我看，这个病例似乎是真的。为什么这个事业有成、婚姻美满并且受人尊敬的人要突然选择放弃一切呢？我相信，这些记忆力衰退的情况确实发生了，并且，确实有人没名没姓、没有背景、没有家庭地漂泊着。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It seems to me you are not altogether uncynical, Mr. Bolder,” I said, after I had read the despatch.“This has the sound, to me, of a genuine case.Why should this man, prosperous, happily married, and respected, choose suddenly to abandon everything?I know that these lapses of memory do occur, and that men do find themselves adrift without a name, a history or a home.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唔，胡说八道！”波尔德先生说，“他们是在寻欢作乐。现在人们知道得太多了。男人们知道了失语症的事，就把它当作借口。女人们也聪明。当一切结束时，她们看着你的眼睛，很懂科学地说：‘他对我施了催眠术。’”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, gammon and jalap!” said Mr. Bolder.“It’s larks they’re after.There’s too much education nowadays.Men know about aphasia, and they use it for an excuse.The women are wise, too.When it’s all over they look you in the eye, as scientific as you please, and say: ‘He hypnotized me.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波尔德先生就这么转移了话题，不再用他的评论和观点来帮助我。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus Mr. Bolder diverted, but did not aid, me with his comments and philosophy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚上10点左右，我们抵达纽约。我搭乘出租马车去了一家旅馆，在登记簿上写下我的名字“爱德华·平卡汉默”。就在我写下这个名字时，我感到全身充斥着一种绝妙的、狂热的、令人陶醉的轻松愉快——一种不受约束的自由感，一种充满新希望之感。我刚刚才出生来到这人世。往日束缚我的枷锁——无论它们曾是什么——都已从我的手脚上给砸掉了。仿佛婴儿刚来到这世上一样，未来在我面前展现了一条阳关大道；并且，我还能够以一个成年男子的学识和阅历来开始这段旅程。</td>
		<td class="en">We arrived in New York about ten at night.I rode in a cab to a hotel, and I wrote my name “Edward Pinkhammer” in the register.As I did so I felt pervade me a splendid, wild, intoxicating buoyancy—a sense of unlimited freedom, of newly attained possibilities.I was just born into the world.The old fetters—whatever they had been—were stricken from my hands and feet.The future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters, and I could set out upon it equipped with a man’s learning and experience.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我觉得旅馆接待员多看了我五秒钟。我没有行李。</td>
		<td class="en">I thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long.I had no baggage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是来参加药剂师大会的，”我说，“我的行李箱不知什么原因还没有到。”我取出一卷钱来。</td>
		<td class="en">“The Druggists’ Convention,” I said.“My trunk has somehow failed to arrive.”I drew out a roll of money.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊！”他露出一颗镶金的牙齿，说道，“我们这儿住着很多西部代表。”他摇铃唤来一个服务生。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah!” said he, showing an auriferous tooth, “we have quite a number of the Western delegates stopping here.”He struck a bell for the boy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我努力给我的角色增添几分色彩。</td>
		<td class="en">I endeavored to give color to my role.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们西部代表中在进行一个重要的运动，”我说，“要向大会建议把装有酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠的瓶子并排放在药架上。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There is an important movement on foot among us Westerners,” I said, “in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimony and potash, and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把这位先生领去314号房。”接待员急忙说。我被匆匆领去我的房间。</td>
		<td class="en">“Gentleman to three-fourteen,” said the clerk, hastily.I was whisked away to my room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天，我买了一个行李箱和一些衣服，开始了作为爱德华·平卡汉默的生活。我没有费脑筋努力去解决有关过去的问题。</td>
		<td class="en">The next day I bought a trunk and clothing, and began to live the life of Edward Pinkhammer.I did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个巨大的岛屿城市把一杯翻滚冒泡的烈酒端到我嘴边。我满怀感激地喝下它。曼哈顿的钥匙属于能够承受它们的人。你要么成为这座城市的座上宾，要么就必然得成为它的牺牲品。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips.I drank of it gratefully.The keys of Manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them.You must be either the city’s guest or its victim.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来的几天过得酣畅淋漓。爱德华·平卡汉默，自出生以来不过几个小时，就已经体验到了罕有的快乐——那以羽翼丰满、无拘无束之身来到一个如此有趣的世界的快乐。我如痴如醉地坐在由剧院和屋顶花园提供的魔毯上，那魔毯把人送往奇异、愉悦的乐土——那儿满是欢快的音乐，漂亮的女孩和对人类滑稽、诙谐、夸张的模仿。我来来去去完全是按照自己的意愿，不受空间、时间或是行为规范的限制。我在怪诞的歌舞餐厅进餐，在更加怪诞的小餐馆里听着匈牙利音乐和雄辩机智的艺术家、雕塑家们狂野的叫喊就餐。又或者，我置身于如自动放映的电影画面一般的、在灯光下摇曳的夜生活中——世界上各种女帽、珠宝、被这些东西装点的女子，以及使这三者成为可能的男子聚在一起花天酒地、招摇过市。在我所提及的所有这些场景中，我认识到了一件我以前从来不明白的事。那就是，通往自由的钥匙不是掌握在许可证手中，而是由惯例所掌管。礼仪有一道关卡，在那儿你必须付费，否则你就可能进不了自由的乐土。在一片光彩夺目中、在表面的混乱中、在炫耀放纵中，我发现了这条规则。尽管不显眼，然而却像铁律，不容忽视。因此，在曼哈顿，你必须遵守这些不成文的规则，而后你将会得到最大限度的自由。假如你拒绝为这些规则所制约，你就等于为自己戴上了镣铐。</td>
		<td class="en">The following few days were as gold and silver.Edward Pinkhammer, yet counting back to his birth by hours only, knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full-fledged and unrestrained.I sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roof-gardens, that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music, pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind.I went here and there at my own dear will, bound by no limits of space, time or comportment.I dined in weird cabarets, at weirder tables d’hôte to the sound of Hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors.Or, again, where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture, and the millinery of the world, and its jewels, and the ones whom they adorn, and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect.And among all these scenes that I have mentioned I learned one thing that I never knew before.And that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of License, but Convention holds it.Comity has a toll-gate at which you must pay, or you may not enter the land of Freedom.In all the glitter, the seeming disorder, the parade, the abandon, I saw this law, unobtrusive, yet like iron, prevail.Therefore, in Manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws, and then you will be freest of the free.If you decline to be bound by them, you put on shackles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时，由于受情绪驱使，我会去找富丽堂皇的、种植棕榈的餐厅，并在那里进餐；那里的人们轻声低语，散发着高贵、优雅、克制的气息。此外，我会乘坐汽船下到水路上，和那些大声喧哗、打扮入时、毫无顾忌地卿卿我我的职员们和女售货员们挤在一起，去曼哈顿海滨寻找粗俗的乐子。当然，还有百老汇——光彩夺目、富丽堂皇、诡计多端、变幻莫测、令人心满意足的百老汇——使人就像吸食鸦片上瘾一样越来越喜欢它。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes, as my mood urged me, I would seek the stately, softly murmuring palm rooms, redolent with high-born life and delicate restraint, in which to dine.Again I would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous, bedecked, unchecked love-making clerks and shop-girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores.And there was always Broadway—glistening, opulent, wily, varying, desirable Broadway—growing upon one like an opium habit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天下午，我走进我住的旅馆时，一个大鼻子、黑胡子的精壮男人在走廊里挡住了我的去路。当我正要从他身边绕过去时，他用令人不适的亲切向我打招呼。</td>
		<td class="en">One afternoon as I entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor.When I would have passed around him, he greet me with offensive familiarity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好啊，贝尔福德！”他大声地喊道，“你到底在纽约干什么？我还不知道有什么东西能把你从你那陈旧的书房拽出来呢。贝尔福德太太和你一起来的，还是你自己一个人来办点小事，嗯？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hello, Bellford!” he cried, loudly.“What the deuce are you doing in New York?Didn’t know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours.Is Mrs. B. along or is this a little business run alone, eh?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“先生，你搞错了，”我冷冷地说道，同时把手从他手中抽出来，“我姓平卡汉默。请见谅。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You have made a mistake, sir,” I said, coldly, releasing my hand from his grasp.“My name is Pinkhammer.You will excuse me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个人退到走廊的一边，显然吃了一惊。当我向接待员的桌子走去时，我听到他唤来一个服务生并说了些关于电报纸的事。</td>
		<td class="en">The man dropped to one side, apparently astonished.As I walked to the clerk’s desk I heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你给我结账，”我对接待员说道，“并派人在半小时内把我的行李拿下来。我不喜欢呆在被自以为是的人打扰的地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You will give me my bill,” I said to the clerk, “and have my baggage brought down in half an hour.I do not care to remain where I am annoyed by confidence men.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天下午，我搬去了另一家旅馆，一家位于第五大街街尾的、安静的、老式风格的旅馆。</td>
