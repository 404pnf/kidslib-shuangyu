		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >严格说来，有关这位著名黑人一生中激动人心的事迹始于他的死亡——也就是说，他引人注目的事迹是从他的第一次死亡开始的。在那之前，几乎没人听说过他，可从那之后，有关他的消息就从未中断过；我们总是每隔一段时间就能听到他的消息。他的一生非同寻常，我已经想过这段历史会为我们的传记文学增添一笔宝贵的财富。因此，为了写这篇文章，我仔细整理了一批资料，资料的来源真实可靠，在这里我将它们呈现给大众。我已经将这篇文章里所有不确切的内容完全删除掉了，目的是为了让我的这一作品进入教科书，以教育我们国家的年轻一代。</td>
		<td class="en">The stirring part of this celebrated colored man’s life properly began with his death—that is to say, the notable features of his biography began with the first time he died.He had been little heard of up to that time, but since then we have never ceased to hear of him; we have never ceased to hear of him at stated, unfailing intervals.His was a most remarkable career, and I have thought that its history would make a valuable addition to our biographical literature.Therefore, I have carefully collated the materials for such a work, from authentic sources, and here present them to the public.I have rigidly excluded from these pages everything of a doubtful character, with the object in view of introducing my work into the schools for the instruction of the youth of my country.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >华盛顿将军的这位著名的贴身仆人名叫乔治。他尽职尽责伺候了自己杰出的主人半个世纪，在此期间，他深得主人的器重和信任，之后，他又怀着悲痛无比的心情履行了他的最后一项职责——让他敬爱的主人在波托马克河畔安静的坟墓中安息。10年后——即1809年——年事已高、功勋卓著的他去世了，所有认识他的人都悼念他。那天的《波斯顿公报》这样报道此事：</td>
		<td class="en">The name of the famous body-servant of General Washington was George.After serving his illustrious master faithfully for half a century, and enjoying throughout his long term his high regard and confidence, it became his sorrowful duty at last to lay that beloved master to rest in his peaceful grave by the Potomac.Ten years afterward—in 1809—full of years and honors, he died himself, mourned by all who knew him.The Boston Gazette of that date thus refers to the event: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔治，已故华盛顿将军挚爱的贴身仆人，上周二在弗吉尼亚的里士满去世，享年95岁高龄。就在他去世前的几分钟，他依然神志清醒，记忆力也很好。他曾经出席过华盛顿总统第二次就职典礼，也参加了华盛顿总统的葬礼；他能清晰地回忆起与这些著名事件相关的所有重要细节。</td>
		<td class="en">George, the favorite body-servant of the lamented Washington, died in Richmond, Va., last Tuesday, at the ripe age of 95 years.His intellect was unimpaired, and his memory tenacious, up to within a few minutes of his decease.He was present at the second installation of Washington as President, and also at his funeral, and distinctly remembered all the prominent incidents connected with those noted events.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从这以后，我们再没听说过华盛顿将军挚爱的贴身仆人的消息，直到1825年5月，他又去世了。费城的一家报纸这样诉说这件令人悲伤的事情：</td>
		<td class="en">From this period we hear no more of the favorite body-servant of General Washington until May, 1825, at which time he died again.A Philadelphia paper thus speaks of the sad occurrence: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上周，在佐治亚州的梅肯市，一位名叫乔治的黑人逝世，此人曾是华盛顿将军挚爱的贴身仆人，享年95岁。直到他离世前的几小时，他身体的各项机能还都保持正常，他还能准确地回忆起华盛顿第二次总统就职仪式以及总统的去世和葬礼。他记得康沃利斯投降、特伦顿战役及在福治山谷里所经受的艰难困苦等等。梅肯市的所有居民都自发到墓地为逝者送行。</td>
		<td class="en">At Macon, Ga., last week, a colored man named George, who was the favorite body-servant of General Washington, died at the advanced age of 95 years.Up to within a few hours of his dissolution he was in full possession of all his faculties, and could distinctly recollect the second installation of Washington, his death and burial, the surrender of Cornwallis, the battle of Trenton, the griefs and hardships of Valley Forge, etc.Deceased was followed to the grave by the entire population of Macon.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">On the Fourth of July, 1830, and also of 1834 and 1836, the subject of this sketch was exhibited in great state upon the rostrum of the orator of the day, and in November of 1840 he died again.The St. Louis Republican of the 25th of that month spoke as follows: </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔治，曾是华盛顿将军挚爱的贴身仆人，昨日在本市约翰·利文沃斯先生的家中去世，享年95岁高龄。就在他生命停止呼吸的最后一个小时前，他身体的各项功能还都保持正常，他还能准确地回忆起华盛顿总统第一次和第二次就职仪式和去世的情景，回忆起康沃利斯投降、特伦顿战役和蒙茅斯战役、革命先驱部队在福治山谷所经受的磨难、《独立宣言》的公布、帕特里克·亨利在弗吉尼亚众议院发表的演说，还有其他很多振奋人心的旧时往事。没有几个白人死后能像这位老黑奴那样让世人悲痛惋惜。参加葬礼的人数众多。</td>
		<td class="en">George, once the favorite body-servant of General Washington, died yesterday at the house of Mr. John Leavenworth in this city, at the venerable age of 95 years.He was in the full possession of his faculties up to the hour of his death, and distinctly recollected the first and second installations and death of President Washington, the surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and Monmouth, the sufferings of the patriot army at Valley Forge, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, the speech of Patrick Henry in the Virginia House of Delegates, and many other old-time reminiscences of stirring interest.Few white men die lamented as was this aged negro.The funeral was very largely attended.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来的10年或11年里，这篇报道的主人公时不时出现在7月4日全国各地的庆典中，每次在讲坛上被演说者展示出来时都会获得巨大的成功。但到1855年秋，他又死了。加利福尼亚州的报纸上是这样登载的：</td>
		<td class="en">During the next ten or eleven years the subject of this sketch appeared at intervals at Fourth-of-July celebrations in various parts of the country, and was exhibited upon the rostrum with flattering success.But in the fall of 1855 he died again.The California papers thus speak of the event: </td></tr>

		<td class="en">ANOTHER OLD HERO GONE </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >3月7日，乔治（曾是华盛顿将军最喜爱的贴身仆人）在达奇弗拉特镇逝世，享年95岁。直到最后一刻，他的记忆力都保持得很好，犹如一间奇异的储藏室，珍藏着各种有趣的往事。他能准确地回忆起华盛顿总统第一次和第二次就职典礼以及总统去世时的情景，记得康沃利斯投降、特伦顿战役、蒙茅斯战役和邦克山战役，记得《独立宣言》的颁布，以及在布拉多克的惨败。乔治在达奇弗拉特镇极受尊重，据统计有1万人出席了他的葬礼。</td>
		<td class="en">Died, at Dutch Flat, on the 7th of March, George (once the confidential body-servant of General Washington), at the great age of 95 years.His memory, which did not fail him till the last, was a wonderful storehouse of interesting reminiscences.He could distinctly recollect the first and second installations and death of President Washington, the surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and Monmouth, and Bunker Hill, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, and Braddock’s defeat.George was greatly respected in Dutch Flat, and it is estimated that there were 10,000 people present at his funeral.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这篇文章的主人公最后一次去世是在1864年6月；除非我们得到相反的说法，否则我们会认为他这次是永远逝世了。密歇根州报纸是这样讲述这一令人悲痛的时刻的：</td>
		<td class="en">The last time the subject of this sketch died was in June, 1864; and until we learn the contrary, it is just to presume that he died permanently this time.The Michigan papers thus refer to the sorrowful event: </td></tr>

		<td class="en">ANOTHER CHERISHED REMNANT OF THE REVOLUTION GONE </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔治，黑人，曾是华盛顿将军挚爱的贴身仆人，上周在底特律去世，享年95岁。弥留之际，他依旧神志清醒，他能准确地回忆起华盛顿第一次和第二次总统就职典礼以及他去世时的情景，记得康沃利斯投降、特伦顿战役和蒙茅斯战役、邦克山战役，记得《独立宣言》的颁布、布拉多克惨败、波士顿港倾茶事件以及清教徒登陆事件。他去世时极受人们爱戴，为其送葬的人群络绎不绝，人数众多。</td>
		<td class="en">George, a colored man, and once the favorite body-servant of George Washington, died in Detroit last week, at the patriarchal age of 95 years.To the moment of his death his intellect was unclouded, and he could distinctly remember the first and second installations and death of Washington, the surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and Monmouth, and Bunker Hill, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, Braddock’s defeat, the throwing over of the tea in Boston harbor, and the landing of the Pilgrims.He died greatly respected, and was followed to the grave by a vast concourse of people.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位忠实的老仆人终于逝去了！在他再次出现前，我们不会再见到他了。如今，他结束了他漫长而又无比辉煌的死亡事业，安息了，因为只有努力争取到休息权利的人才能长眠。无论从哪一方面讲，他都是个与众不同的人。比起历史上任何一位叱咤风云的人物，他都更会使自己的生命保持不朽；他活得越久，记忆力就会变得越发地历久弥新。如果他能活到再去世一次，他将能准确地回忆起发现美洲大陆一事。</td>
		<td class="en">The faithful old servant is gone!We shall never see him more until he turns up again.He has closed his long and splendid career of dissolution, for the present, and sleeps peacefully, as only they sleep who have earned their rest.He was in all respects a remarkable man.He held his age better than any celebrity that has figured in history; and the longer he lived the stronger and longer his memory grew.If he lives to die again, he will distinctly recollect the discovery of America.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然他可能一两次死在偏僻的地方没能被报纸扬名，我还是认为以上有关他自传的介绍大体是正确的。我从我引用的所有关于他死亡的报道中发现了一处错误，这个错误应该进行修改。在所有的报道中，他去世的年龄都是无一例外的95岁。这压根是不可能的。他有可能做到一次或两次，但他不可能永远在95岁死去。假设他第一次去世时就是享年95岁，那他最后在1864年去世时，应该有151岁了。除此以外，他的年龄和他的回忆不同步。他最后一次去世时，竟然能准确地回忆清教徒登陆事件，而那是1620发生的事。他亲眼目睹那件事的时候应该有20岁左右吧，由此我们可以大胆推测华盛顿将军的贴身仆人最后一次与世长辞时应该接近两百六七十岁的高龄了。</td>
		<td class="en">The above resume of his biography I believe to be substantially correct, although it is possible that he may have died once or twice in obscure places where the event failed of newspaper notoriety.One fault I find in all the notices of his death I have quoted, and this ought to be correct.In them he uniformly and impartially died at the age of 95.This could not have been.He might have done that once, or maybe twice, but he could not have continued it indefinitely.Allowing that when he first died, he died at the age of 95, he was 151 years old when he died last, in 1864.But his age did not keep pace with his recollections.When he died the last time, he distinctly remembered the landing of the Pilgrims, which took place in 1620.He must have been about twenty years old when he witnessed that event, wherefore it is safe to assert that the body-servant of General Washington was in the neighborhood of two hundred and sixty or seventy years old when he departed this life finally.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了确保那文章中的主角的的确确永远地离开了我们，我等待了相当长一段时间。现在我终于可以满怀信心地发表他的传记，并怀着崇敬之情将其呈现给哀悼中的国民。</td>
		<td class="en">Having waited a proper length of time, to see if the subject of this sketch had gone from us reliably and irrevocably, I now publish his biography with confidence, and respectfully offer it to a mourning nation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >附言——我看到报纸上报道这个臭名昭著的老骗子又死了，在阿肯色州。加上这次，他为人所知的死亡次数已经六次了，而且每次都换一个新地方。华盛顿贴身仆人的死已经不再是新鲜事了，魅力消失了，国人厌倦了，让它就此结束吧。到现在，这位善意的却误入歧途的黑人已经让六个不同的社区为体面地安葬他而破费，还诱骗成千上万人送他到墓地，让这些人误以为有个出类拔萃、与众不同的大人物托付给了他们。如今，就让他永远埋葬于地下吧。从今往后，哪家报社要是再刊登华盛顿将军挚爱的贴身黑人仆人的死讯，就等着遭受最严厉的谴责吧。</td>
		<td class="en">P.S.—I see by the papers that this infamous old fraud has just died again, in Arkansas.This makes six times that he is known to have died, and always in a new place.The death of Washington’s body-servant has ceased to be a novelty; it’s charm is gone; the people are tired of it; let it cease.This well-meaning but misguided negro has now put six different communities to the expense of burying him in state, and has swindled tens of thousands of people into following him to the grave under the delusion that a select and peculiar distinction was being conferred upon them.Let him stay buried for good now; and let that newspaper suffer the severest censure that shall ever, in all the future time, publish to the world that General Washington’s favorite colored body-servant has died again.</td></tr>
