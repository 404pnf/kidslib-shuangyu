		<td class="en">临走前，他四处望了望，看看屋子里有什么东西可以带着上路的。但是找来找去，他只找到了一块存放已久的奶酪，于是他把它带上了。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">走到房子前面，他又看见了之前在灌木丛中捉到的一只鸟，于是他把它放进奶酪旁边的袋子里。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">他爬上了一座小山。山顶上坐着一个强壮的巨人，此时他正镇定地俯瞰山中风景。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: “What a poor wretched little creature you are!”</td>
		<td class="en">巨人轻蔑地看了看小裁缝，说：“你这个可怜的小家伙啊！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“That’s a good joke,” answered the little tailor, and unbuttoning his coat he showed the giant the girdle.</td>
		<td class="en">“那是个善意的玩笑。”小裁缝一边回答，一边解开他的外套，向巨人展示了那条布带，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“There now, you can read what sort of a fellow I am.”</td>
		<td class="en">“现在，你可以看出我是什么样的人了吧。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The giant read: “Seven at a blow”; and thinking they were human beings the tailor had slain, he conceived a certain respect for the little man.</td>
		<td class="en">巨人看了看：“一下打死七个”，以为小裁缝打死的是七个人，因此对他多了一些敬意。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But first he thought he’d test him, so taking up a stone in his hand, he squeezed it till some drops of water ran out.</td>
		<td class="en">不过，他还是想先考验考验他，于是拿起一块石头放在手里，使劲捏，直到捏出水来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Now you do the same,” said the giant, “if you really wish to be thought strong.”</td>
		<td class="en">“现在你照着做吧，”巨人说道，“如果你想让人们觉得你很强壮的话。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Is that all?” said the little tailor; “that’s child’s play to me,” so he dived into his wallet, brought out the cheese, and pressed it till the whey ran out.</td>
		<td class="en">“就那样？”小裁缝说，“对我来说不过是小儿科。”于是他从口袋里掏出奶酪，使劲压，直到乳浆直往外流。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“My squeeze was in sooth better than yours,” said he.</td>
		<td class="en">“我捏得确实要比你好。”他说。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“轮到你了，小家伙，让我瞧瞧你怎么做。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Well thrown,” said the tailor; “but, after all, your stone fell to the ground; I’ll throw one that won’t come down at all.”</td>
		<td class="en">“扔得好，”小裁缝说道，“但是，你的石头毕竟还是落地了，而我扔出去的根本不会掉下来。”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“You can certainly throw,” said the giant; “but now let’s see if you can carry a proper weight.”</td>
		<td class="en">“你扔得当然不错，”巨人说，“但是，现在让我们比比看，看你能不能扛起合适的重量。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >With these words he led the tailor to a huge oak tree which had been felled to the ground, and said: “If you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the wood.”</td>
		<td class="en">话音一落，他就带着小裁缝来到一棵已倒在地上的大橡树前，说：“如果你够强壮，就帮我把这棵树抬出森林。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Most certainly,” said the little tailor: “just you take the trunk on your shoulder; I’ll bear the top and branches, which is certainly the heaviest part.”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The giant laid the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor sat at his ease among the branches; and the giant, who couldn’t see what was going on behind him, had to carry the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain.</td>
		<td class="en">巨人把树干放在肩膀上，而小裁缝轻松地坐在树枝上；巨人走在前面，看不到后面发生了什么，不得不扛起整棵树和小裁缝。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There he sat behind in the best of spirits, lustily whistling a tune, as if carrying the tree were mere sport.</td>
		<td class="en">小裁缝坐在后面，精神饱满，还一边哼着小调，好像扛一棵树不过是一种消遣。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The giant, after dragging the heavy weight for some time, could get on no further, and shouted out: “Hi!</td>

		<td class="en">小裁缝敏捷地跳下来，两手抓着树，好像他一路都扛着似的，然后对巨人说：“你这么大一个人居然扛不起一棵树！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They continued to go on their way together, and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruit hung, gave the branches into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat.</td>
		<td class="en">他们继续往前走。路过一棵樱桃树的时候，巨人一把抓住树的顶端，那上面悬挂着熟透了的果子，然后把树枝放到小裁缝手里，命令他吃下去。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself, the giant said: “What! do you mean to tell me you haven’t the strength to hold down a feeble twig?”</td>
		<td class="en">小裁缝掉到地上，并没有伤到自己。巨人说：“什么！你这意思是想告诉我你竟然没有力气抓住一根柔弱的树枝吗？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“It wasn’t strength that was wanting,” replied the tailor; “do you think that would have been anything for a man who has killed seven at a blow?</td>
		<td class="en">“力气不是重点，”小裁缝答道，“难道你认为对于一个一下打死七个的人来说，那也算事儿吗？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us.</td>
		<td class="en">我刚刚从那棵树上翻下来，是因为附近有猎人朝树枝上开枪。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Do you do the like if you dare.”</td>
		<td class="en">如果你敢，你也那样做做看。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The giant made an attempt, but couldn’t get over the tree, and stuck fast in the branches, so that here too the little tailor had the better of him.</td>
		<td class="en">巨人试了一下，跳不过那棵树，还一下子卡在了树枝上，小裁缝因此更加佩服自己了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Well, you’re a fine fellow, after all,” said the giant; “come and spend the night with us in our cave.”</td>
		<td class="en">“好吧，你是个好家伙，”巨人说道，“晚上到洞里和我们一起过夜吧。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The little tailor willingly consented to do this, and following his friend they went on till they reached a cave where several other giants were sitting round a fire, each holding a roast sheep in his hand, of which he was eating.</td>
		<td class="en">小裁缝欣然答应，跟着他的朋友继续前行，来到一个洞里。那里坐着几个巨人，他们围着一堆火，每个人手里拿着一只烤羊在吃。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The little tailor looked about him, and thought: “Yes, there’s certainly more room to turn round in here than in my workshop.”</td>
		<td class="en">小裁缝环顾四周，心想：“嗯，这儿的空间的确比我那小裁缝店大多了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The giant showed him a bed and bade him lie down and have a good sleep.</td>
		<td class="en">巨人给小裁缝指了一张床，命令他躺下，好好睡一觉。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the bed was too big for the little tailor, so he didn’t get into it, but crept away into the corner.</td>
		<td class="en">可是，这张床太大了，小裁缝根本不适应，于是，他慢慢地缩到了一个角落里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At midnight, when the giant thought the little tailor was fast asleep, he rose up, and taking his big iron walking-stick, he broke the bed in two with a blow, and thought he had made an end of the little grasshopper.</td>
		<td class="en">午夜时分，巨人以为小裁缝熟睡了，于是爬起来，拿起他的大铁拐棍一挥，把床劈成了两半，心想这下了结了这只小蚱蜢。</td></tr>
