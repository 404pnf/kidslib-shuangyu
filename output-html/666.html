		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在中国，对古物的研究在宋朝（960年～127年）初期就已经开始有所发展，当时曾经有百余年的鼎盛期，为以后的发展奠定了 坚实的基础。18～19世纪古学的复兴包含了一股古物热的风潮，这股热潮被认为与宋学一脉相承，此种看法是正确的。西方科学开始对中国产生实在的影响，已是在20世纪初以后。因此，中国近代考古学的概念可以说是从两个截然不同而又相互补充的传统发展而来：一方面，它是从中国古典学问中的金石学这一特殊分支发展而来；另一方面，它又与地质学和生物学中首先发展起来的田野调查与地下发掘联系在一起，西方考古学正是从这些科学中逐渐发展出来。既然如此，那么，与大多数中国第一次接触到的自然科学不同，考古学极好地将西方近代科学和中国古典学问联系起来。要准确评价目前正在进行的工作和未来可达成的目标，有必要对中国古学研究的历史作一番了解。</td>
		<td class="en">Antiquarian studies in China began to develop in the beginning of the Sung Dynasty (960-1126, A.D.). They enjoyed a glorious period for more than one hundred years, during which a solid foundation was laid for later development. The classical revival in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries included a very strong current of antiquarian interest, which has been rightly considered as the direct descendant of Sung scholarship. Western science began to affect China seriously, only at the beginning of the twentieth century. So the concept of modern archaeology in China may be said to be developed from two entirely different, but mutually complementary traditions: on the one hand, it is related to that special branch of classical learning known as the Study of Metals and Stones; and on the other, to the field explorations and excavations, which were first developed in the science of geology and biology, and from which archaeology in the West has been gradually evolved. Such being the case, archaeology, therefore, unlike most other natural sciences which have come to China unprecedented, serves best to link together modern science and traditional Chinese learning. In order to make a proper estimate of what is being done at present and what can be achieved in the future, it is necessary that something should be known of China’s antiquarian past.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在已故王国维教授发表的《宋代之金石学》一文中，他指出宋代学者在金石研究多个方面取得了非凡成绩，尤其体现在搜集、著录和考订方面。他们在研究所及之领域均获得了极高的成就，有些至今尚无人能及。应该注意到，这只是宋代这场大的思想运动的部分结果，这场运动在许多不同领域都取得了重要成果。此次运动整体呈现出极具建设性的特点，许多史学巨著、精神财富都起源于那个时代。虽然对于古物的兴趣无疑只是宋代史学思想发展的一个阶段，但它从一开始就获得了独立的发展。这一时期留传下来的有关这一主题的著作，其中的许多观念都出人意料地具有近代特征。诚然，那时没有历史方法，没有比较方法，更没有试图创造一个综合体系，但他们追求准确描述和复制的努力以及他们的许多考订，都是颇值得称道的。11～12世纪出版的《考古图》和《博古图》绝不仅仅是一个收藏指南，其中创立了一个著录和复制古物的系统，除了因近代印刷技术的改进而造成的在少数细节上比较落后外，这一系统直到今天都是这方面论著的典范。也许无法检测其度量与复制的精确程度，但他们力求精确的目标是显而易见的；他们在辨识古物方面表现出的独创性和正确性已为近代批评界所印证。由于那时印刷术早已发明，因此，收藏古物之风传播极快。更令人惊叹的是，尽管最大最著名的收藏是皇室收藏，但收藏之风尚却主要是由个人开创并维持的。因此，王国维教授在其《宋代之金石学》 一文中说：</td>
		<td class="en">In a paper published by the late Professor Wang Kwo-wei on “Archaeology in the Sung Dynasty,” he pointed out the distinct achievements by Sung scholars in archaeology, in several different fields. The more important of these are collecting, recording, and identifying. In all these their merits rank very high; some remain unsurpassed down to the present time. It is interesting to note that this is only part of the result of a broad intellectual movement of the Sung Dynasty, which yielded important achievements in many different spheres. The whole movement was characterized by a great deal of constructive effort; many of the monumental works on history, treasures of Chinese spiritual possessions, date from this period. While the interest in antiquities was no doubt a phase of the historical mentality of the time, it attained an independent development in the very beginning. Works on this subject left to us from this period are strangely modern in many of their ideas. It is true that there was neither historical nor comparative method, nor any attempt at a comprehensive system, but the effort aimed at accurate presentation and reproduction, and many of their identifications are quite praiseworthy. *K’ao Ku T’ou* and *Po Ku T’ou* published between the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D. are more than a collector’s handbook. In them a system was created for recording and reproducing antiquities, which, except for minor details due to improvements in modern printing, has been taken as a model of all treatises on antiques till the present day. It may not be possible to test the accuracy of their measurements or reproductions, but their aims at being accurate are more than obvious; and the ingenuity and correctness of most of their identifications have been confirmed by modern criticism. As printing was at that time already invented, so the vogue of collecting spread fast. What is more remarkable is that the fashion of collecting was created and maintained chiefly by private individuals, in spite of the fact that the largest and the most well- known collection is an Imperial one. Thus Professor Wang says in his paper on “Archaeology in the Sung Dynasty”:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">> Remarkable as was the Imperial collection, the fashion of collecting ancient objects, however, was created by private individuals. History records that Liu Ch’ang, when governor of Yung Hsing (present Hsianfu in Shensi), secured eleven objects of pre-Ch’in periods; and that Li Kung-lin, having a wide acquaintance with objects of antiquity and being skilful in judging them, showed such enthusiasm, that whenever he heard of an object of value, he would not hesitate in the least to pay a price of a thousand taels. Books such as Lü Ta-lin’s *K’ao Ku T’ou*, *Hsu K’ao Ku T’ou* by an unknown author, Wang Fu-chai’s *Chung Ting K’uan Shih*, and the appendices of the *Tsih Ku Lu*and *Chin Shih Lu*, very frequently record the names of the collectors underneath the descriptions of the objects. The collectors thus recorded numbered no less than several scores... (p. 223)</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The scope of those collections included mainly bronzes and jades, but coins and some kinds of stone work were sometimes also included. Although they concentrated most of their interest on inscriptions, it is the merit of the Sung archaeologists that they were able to see, in the antiques which they were collecting, important materials for studying ancient institutions. It was the common belief of the Sung antiquarians that it needed men versed in rituals to know the usage of antiques. Thus they made two great contributions towards the gradual building up of an antiquarian science in China: namely epigraphical study, and identification of forms, besides their persistent effort in collecting, reproducing, and circulating. In about one hundred years or so, they created a new science and perfected a new technique.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由北宋学者建立的这门新科学，即使在遭遇靖康年间金人突袭、摧毁京城的灾难后，仍顽强地沿续了下来。事实上，它一直延续到宋朝末年。许多有关古物学方面的著名论著都是在宋朝后期完成的。</td>
		<td class="en">This new science, founded by a group of Northern Sung scholars, was ably continued even after the disastrous event of the Tsing K’ang era when the Golden Tartars raided the capital city at K’aifeng and made it a ruin. In fact it continued to the very end of the Sung Dynasty. Many notable treatises on antiques were produced in the later period.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于此种连续不断的努力，这一新兴科学的基础得以建立牢固；也正因为如此，即使在经过了近500年后，它仍有足够的生命力给清朝古学的复兴以新的动力。“由乾隆中叶以后直至现在，一百五十年间，这种学问有很猛烈的进步”，梁启超在欢迎瑞典王储到访中国的致辞中说。他还继续说道：“关于考古学的著作，数目的增加实在可惊，据我所看见过，认为很有价值已经成书的，不下四百种。”</td>
		<td class="en">Owing to this continued activity, the foundation of the new science was laid firmly; so even after a total lapse of almost five hundred years, it still retained enough vitality to give new strength to the classical revival in the Manchu Dynasty. “During the 150 years, from the middle of Chien Lung’s reign to the present, marvellous progress has been made in the study of archaeology, ...” says Liang Ch’i-ch’ao in an address in honor of the visit of the Crown Prince of Sweden to China. “The number of books on archaeology is truly astonishing. I am familiar with at least 400 books which I consider as valuable contributions to this subject,” he continued. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一时期的著作几乎没有偏离宋代的原型，不过更精确、更详细而已。从总体上看，他们是更优秀的碑铭研究家。由于这一时期对于文本考据的浓厚兴趣，古物研究得到大力提倡，因为它们提供了如此多的新材料，对于研究和解释古代经典显然极有帮助。著名的《皇清经解》的编者阮元，同时也是《积古斋钟鼎彝器款识》的作者，后者是这一时期研究青铜器铭文的最早的专著之一。自阮元以后，涌现出了一大批学者型的古物学家，直到西方影响渗入中国，传统的金石学逐渐进入一个过渡性的中间阶段。古老传统与西方影响接触的结果催生了近代中国新的考古学。</td>
		<td class="en">The works of this period, however, deviate very little from their Sung prototype; but they have attained greater accuracy, and are worked in greater detail. They are on the whole better epigraphists. Owing to the intensive interest in textual criticism of this period, antiquarian studies were much encouraged, as they offered so much new material, and were evidently helpful in the study and interpretation of ancient classics. Yüan Yüan, who edited the famous *Huang Ch’ing Chin Chieh*, is also the author of *Chi Ku Chai Chung Ting I Ch’i K’uan Shih*, one of the first treatises on bronze inscriptions written in this period. From Yüan Yüan’s time on, a long list of scholarly antiquarians has followed, until it gradually merges into an intermediate stage when Western influence began to penetrate. The result of the contact of this influence with the old tradition is the birth of a new archaeology in modern China.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一时期的重大贡献在于铭文研究的进步。在这一领域，宋人只是开其端绪而已。此外，他们的兴趣也比宋人更为广泛，并撰写了有关砖、瓦、印玺及某些特定地区的其他古物的专门论著。公允地讲，到19世纪末，传统的古物学早已发展了到离近代考古科学仅有一步之遥的阶段。例如，吴大论玉器的专著及其对早期铭文的研究，可与任一同类性质的现代科学著作相媲美。即使没有西方的影响，中国传统的考古学是否也已发展到近代阶段，对此我们很难下结论。无论如何，若没有这样一个背景，考古学不会在中国引起如此多的兴趣，这是显而易见的。</td>
		<td class="en">The great contribution of this period is the advancement of epigraphical studies, of which the Sung antiquarians made only a start. They also showed a more diversified interest, and produced special treatises on bricks, tiles, seals, and other antiques of a given locality. It is only fair to say that at the end of the nineteenth century, traditional antiquarian science had already developed to such a stage that it was only a step from the standard of Modern Archaeology. Wu Ta-chêng’s treatise on jade, and his study of early inscriptions, for instance, can stand comparison with any modern scientific treatise of a similar nature. It is an even bet whether or not traditional archaeology in China would have advanced to the modern stage even without Western influence! It is at any rate obvious that without such background archaeology would not have attracted so much interest in China at the present time.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我们讨论近期工作之前，应当关注一下西方对中国古物的勘查是如何影响中国古典学派的。在此方面，有两件大事特别值得一提：一是敦煌卷子的发现，二是地质调查所的活动。因篇幅所限，此处不可能详叙敦煌宝藏发现的经过，对此感兴趣的读者 可以参阅斯坦因和伯希和的著作。这一发现更深远地影响了近年来的中国古典学派，令人信服地向保守的中国学界证明：即使在古学研究领域，田野调查也比单纯的书本研究要有成效得多。这一时期的影响是由一个特别幸运的情况引发的，即：敦煌卷子既丰富又多样，恰恰又与最早的印刷本的书籍出现的前一个时代相联系。一些上一辈最优秀的思想家都潜心研读这些新发现的材料，其所得之结果几乎是革命性的。仔细研读罗振玉和王国维两位这一时期内研究最具代表性、最杰出学者的著作，就会发现正是这一研究新材料的机遇才使得其研究成果具有不朽价值。</td>
		<td class="en">Before we discuss recent works, it is worth while to note how Western explorations of Chinese antiques have reacted upon the classical school of China. In this connection, two great events need special mentioning: one is the discoveries of the Tun Huang Manuscripts, and the other is the activity of the Geological Survey. I have no space here to relate in any detail the story leading to the discovery of the Tun Huang treasury. Those who are interested may be referred to the publications of Aurel Stein and Paul Pelliot. This discovery has influenced the classical school of China in recent years most profoundly, and it proves convincingly to the conservative Chinese learned world how much more fruitful is field exploration than mere book pursuit, even in classical study. This stage of reaction was brought forth by a very fortunate circumstance; that is, the Tun Huang manuscripts are both rich and variegated, and relate to a period immediately preceding the age of the earliest printed books. Some of the best minds of the last generation were occupied with the study of this new discovery; the results are almost revolutionary. A perusal of the works of Lo Chên-Yü and Wang Kuo-wei, two of the most eminent scholars, whose activity may be properly assigned to this stage, show, that what makes their achievements enduring is their opportunity to study these new materials.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同时，一批活跃的思想家开始沿着另一条路线开展工作，这必将在同一方向上对考古学产生健康的影响，并加速中国近现代考古学的诞生。此处指地质调查所的活动。该所的建立有其特定的目标，且该目标正在成功实现；同时，他们又有足够的余力对灵生代时期展开仔细研究。这导致了一系列考古学著作的问世，以最近北京人的发现达到了顶峰。不过，对考古学产生更为直接影响的，是地质调查所的瑞典籍顾问安特生在东北、河南、甘肃所开展的研究工作。在上述省区，安氏发现了一种此前完全不为人知的中国早期文化，此种早期文化与传统的中国文化的关系已经引起大量猜测。这些发现引发了人们对于中国早期历史的强烈兴趣。年青一代终于完全相信考古发掘工作的巨大潜力，此类研究计划也已经开始成熟。</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile some energetic minds began working along a different line, which was bound to exercise a healthful influence in the same direction and quicken the birth of a modern archaeology in China. I mean to refer to the activity of the Geological Survey of China. The survey was established for a definite purpose, which is being successfully fulfilled; besides, they have found enough energy to pay a great deal of attention to the psychozoic period. This has resulted in a series of archaeological works culminating in the recent discovery of Sinanthropus Pekinensis. But the works that have a more immediate bearing on archaeology are those undertaken by J. G. Andersson, Swedish advisor to the Survey, in Manchuria, Honan, and Kansu, where he found an early Chinese culture totally unknown before, and whose relation to the traditional Chinese culture has aroused a great deal of speculation.An intense interest in early Chinese history has been stimulated by these discoveries. The younger generations are finally and totally convinced of the great possibilities of archaeological excavations; plans for such activity have begun to mature.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">From a purely archaeological viewpoint, as different from that of early antiquarians, there are certain problems never thought worth consideration by traditional historians, which have gained their importance through the development of natural sciences. When China is now viewed not as an isolated unit by itself, but merely a fragment of the total humanity, one finds that a great deal of materials, totally disregarded by early antiquarians, become extremely informative and historically significant. From this point of view China is an extremely rich field which has just begun to be explored.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Many of the institutions of higher learning like the Department of Chinese Studies of the Peking Government University, the Historical Museum, and the Tsing Hua Research Institute began to take up these new problems, and became interested in archaeological excavations in the last decade. Although it has not been possible to carry out all the plans, sporadic work has been done from time to time, and some of it has been done meritoriously. However, it remains for the Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, to be the first sponsor of serious archaeological excavations. The recent work undertaken by the Institute in Anyang deserves special mention for a variety of reasons; it is thoroughly modern in its planning; it is one of the key sites of North China; it has yielded abundant results; and above all, it has been of interest to both the early antiquarians and the modern archaeologists. So it may be taken as a typical example of recent work done in this field.</td></tr>

He died in the Boxer’s time the year following. His collection passed into the hands of Liu Tieh-yün, who was the first to make rubbings on these inscribed bones, and publish them in book form. Then it was followed by some periodical bone-rushes among the curio dealers, a great deal of serious work, and some very interesting episodes when these new materials were struggling for recognition. During this period serious studies were made chiefly by Lo Chên-Yü, and Wang Kuo-wei, who deciphered about half of these newly discovered characters, thus laying the foundation of this new branch of palaeography. In the early period the work were carried on with a great deal of opposition from other quarters. Chang Ping-lin for instance, one of the greatest living Chinese scholars at the time, who is in certain sense radical in his political thought, but conservative in his literary ideas, considered these materials as forgeries. Nevertheless, studies were carried on and new inscribed bones were added to the market every day. The actual site was eventually ascertained. Lo Chên-Yü had the originality of visiting it himself but at that time he considered the site, so far as the inscribed bones were concerned, as already exhausted. All the while it never occurred to anybody that excavations might be fruitful.</td></tr>

It was also known that it was the capital city of the Shang Dynasty, and that many other things were found together with these bones.

It can now be categorically laid down that Hsiao-t’un Ts’un, where the diggings were carried out for three seasons, was once part of the capital city of the Shang Dynasty, sometime between 1400 and 1200 B.C., but it was deserted during the final collapse of the Dynasty.

They represent undoubtedly one of the early stages in the development of Chinese writing, from which the later ones have gradually been evolved.

Judging by the great abundance of these bones and the contents of the inscriptions, it is quite definite that oracles regulated even the minute details of the conduct of the king. Whether it was an act of performing a sacrifice, or taking a trip, going out hunting or fishing, inquiring about the weather, or sending out an expedition, the cracks of the bones must be consulted; answers were found in the signs of these cracks, which the king evidently had to obey. It is for this reason that the inscribed bones have been found in such great abundance and with content so rich that from them a great deal of the lost history of that period, political, social, economic, and religious, can be reconstructed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些刻有文字的甲骨固然重要，相关发现的重要性也同样不可忽视。由于可以大体确定这一文化所处的时期，同时期的史前器物所反映的物质文化，不仅可以证实甲骨上的文字内容，而且还能更进一步地补充这些文字内容。我们关于这一时期文化的许多认识几乎完全依赖于这些发现。例如，从甲骨文中，我们还难以确定：这一时期的商人是仍处于石器时代，还是已经开始使用金属；如果他们使用金属，到什么程度。石器或金属实物本身提供了这方面的确切资料。经过仔细的地层研究，我们现已确知，这一时期的商人已经掌握了相当先进的铸铜技术。他们用青铜来制造兵器、礼器和饰品，在当地发展起了庞大的青铜业，此点可由当地出土的铸模、铜矿以及带有铜锈的熔渣证明。但与此同时，铜、锡的供应必定有限，因此还有大量的器皿，如斧头和刀子等，都是用青铜和石头混合制造的。笔者认为，对这一时期人们可能既使用石器又使用金属这一事实的表现和佐证，大大增加了我们对于中国早期历史的认识，同时也为对早期文化迁移有兴趣的学者提供了新的材料。</td>
		<td class="en">Important as these inscribed bones are, the associated finds are no less so. Inasmuch as the time can be approximately defined, the material culture, as revealed in the artifacts contemporaneous with this period, can both substantiate the verbal statements on the bones and, to an even greater extent, supplement them. A great deal of our knowledge concerning the culture of this period depends almost entirely on such finds. For instance, it would be difficult to find out from the inscriptions whether the Shang people of this period were still in the stone age or had already begun to use metals; if they used metals, to what extent. The stone or metal objects themselves furnish the exact data. By means of careful stratigraphical study we know for certain now that the Shang people of this period had already mastered to a very advanced degree the secret of casting bronze. They made weapons, ceremonial vessels, and many ornaments of this metal, and developed an extensive bronze industry right on the spot, as proved by the remains of moulds, bronze ore, and slags attached by copper rust. But at the same time, the copper and tin supply must have been somewhat limited, so a great number of utensils were still made both of bronze and stones, such as axes and knives, etc. That it is possible to show and prove that in this period people were using both stone and metals, is, I believe, a great contribution to our knowledge of early Chinese history, and at the same time furnishes new materials for students who are interested in the migrations of early cultures.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >陶器——考古学的基本材料之一——已被大量发现。所发现的陶器包含许多迥异的类型，显然证明了这是不同产地陶器的汇聚，这正如人们预想中的大都市文化一样。关于这一行业的一项惊人发现是釉的使用。此前学界一直认为，釉的使用最早是在汉代。尽管这些陶器是从四面八方汇聚而来，但总体上都有这一时期陶器的几个典型特征。比如，它们都是单色的，刻有装饰线条，完全不同于仰韶新石器时代那种多色、绘饰的陶器。仰韶时期器皿的遗存也发现于这一遗址。这一发现的意义在于，它有助于确定此前一直未能确定的仰韶时期的时间下限。</td>
		<td class="en">Ceramics, which are basic archaeological materials, have been found in great quantity. They consist of many fundamentally different types, easily proven to be an aggregation of different local productions, as is to be expected of a metropolitan culture. One of the amazing discoveries concerning this industry is its use of glaze, the beginning of which has been hitherto considered to be sometime in the Han Dynasty. In spite of its aggregative character, the ceramics on the whole share certain individual traits typical of this period. For instance they are all\\ monochrome and decorated by incised lines, entirely different from the aëneolithic Yang-shao ceramics, which are polychrome and decorated by paintings. Survivals of Yang-shao wares were discovered on this site. This discovery is of some importance because it helps to determine the lower limit of the age of Yang-shao which has never been definitely fixed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The finds also contain many decorative works of shell, stone, and bone, illustrating profusely the art of the period. The decorative elements on the whole are quite consonant with the traditional ideas relating to the art of the period, only proving to be more luxurious.

		<td class="en">These are only a few examples of the finds from this site; many are still in the hands of specialists whose opinions are being awaited as to their real significance. Even these few are sufficient to show the general nature of the contents and the importance that may be attached to them. From an archaeological viewpoint it is most fortunate that this site should have been chosen for the first serious work. When the materials are thoroughly studied they will help to clarify many difficult problems and serve as standard of definite value by which others may be compared and judged. In other words we have got a key site in North China, gradually worked out and found a guide to direct our search in the archaeological maze of the Yellow River Valley.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The work of the Institute has already created a widespread interest in archaeological excavation in China. To follow up this work many plans have been made by various universities and museums to excavate early remains.

But from practical experience can we say anything about the archaeological prospects of this country?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有人曾经告诉笔者说，1880年派特力前往埃及时，没有一个前辈鼓励他；在那时的许多专家看来，从考古学意义上讲，埃及早已考之殆尽，无可再考。自他对吉萨的金字塔进行三角定位以来，已经五十年过去了。在这段时期里，许多前人连做梦都未想到过的发现却一个接一个出现了。直到今天为止，对于年轻的考古学家来说，埃及学仍像半个世纪前那样充满魅力。中国有着古老的传统，探索才刚刚开始。最近的工作结果充分证明，一把铁锹在其他古国可以发现奇迹，在中国同样可以发现奇迹。同美索不达米亚、埃及、希腊、罗马一样，有了这一源头所发掘出的资料，中国被遗忘的历史必将被重新书写。</td>
		<td class="en">I have been told that when Sir Flinders Petrie first went to Egypt in 1880 he was not at all encouraged by any of his senior workers; the fact was that Egypt seemed to many experts at that time to have been archaeologically exhausted. Fifty years have now passed since his first triangulation of the Pyramids in Gizeh, and many undreamed of discoveries have been made, one after another in this period; yet, to this day, Egyptology seems to be a field for young archaeologists just as alluring as it was fifty years ago. China possesses an ancient tradition and is just beginning to be explored. Results of the recent works prove most substantially that the spade can work just as many wonders here as it did in other old countries. The forgotten history of China will certainly be written on materials to be recovered from this source, as has been the case with Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome.</td></tr>
