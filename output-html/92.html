		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >作者：欧·亨利</td>
		<td class="en">by O. Henry</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我真幸运，能把出色的纽约侦探沙姆罗克·乔尔摩斯算进我的朋友圈子当中。乔尔摩斯被人称为本市侦探界的“内部人士”。他使用打字机可是位行家。每当有“杀人谜案”需要侦破时，他的职责就是坐在总部的一部台式电话机前，记录那些打电话来自首的“怪人”的口供。</td>
		<td class="en">I am so fortunate as to count Shamrock Jolnes, the great New York detective, among my muster of friends.Jolnes is what is called the “inside man” of the city detective force.He is an expert in the use of the typewriter, and it is his duty, whenever there is a “murder mystery” to be solved, to sit at a desk telephone at headquarters and take down the messages of “cranks” who ’phone in their confessions to having committed the crime.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，在某些比较“清闲”的日子里，自首电话迟迟不来，三四家报纸也费尽心思找出了许多不同的罪犯，乔尔摩斯便与我去镇上闲逛，展示他无与伦比的观察和推理能力，这使我高兴万分，也受益匪浅。</td>
		<td class="en">But on certain “off” days when confessions are coming in slowly and three or four newspapers have run to earth as many different guilty persons, Jolnes will knock about the town with me, exhibiting, to my great delight and instruction, his marvellous powers of observation and deduction.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，我顺路来到总部，发现这位大侦探正在若有所思地凝视着紧紧系在他的小指上的一根细线。</td>
		<td class="en">The other day I dropped in at Headquarters and found the great detective gazing thoughtfully at a string that was tied tightly around his little finger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好，华笙，”他头也不转地说，“我很高兴注意到你终于在家里装上电灯了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good morning, Whatsup,” he said, without turning his head.“I’m glad to notice that you’ve had your house fitted up with electric lights at last.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“能否请你告诉我，”我惊讶地问，“你是怎么知道的？我确定这件事我从未告诉过别人，线路还是今天早上才匆匆装好的呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Will you please tell me,” I said, in surprise, “how you knew that?I am sure that I never mentioned the fact to any one, and the wiring was a rush order not completed until this morning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很简单。”乔尔摩斯愉快地说，“你一进来我就嗅到了你正在抽的雪茄烟味儿。我能闻得出价格不菲的雪茄；并且我知道，目前全纽约能抽得起雪茄、付得起煤气账单的人不超过三个。那是很容易的。不过，我现在正在思考自己的一个小问题。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nothing easier,” said Jolnes, genially.“As you came in I caught the odour of the cigar you are smoking.I know an expensive cigar; and I know that not more than three men in New York can afford to smoke cigars and pay gas bills too at the present time.That was an easy one.But I am working just now on a little problem of my own.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你手指上为什么会系一根细线？”我问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why have you that string on your finger?” I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那就是我在想的问题，”乔尔摩斯说，“今天早上我夫人系上这个，提醒我往家里带点儿什么东西。请坐，华笙，恕我失陪一会儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s the problem,” said Jolnes.“My wife tied that on this morning to remind me of something I was to send up to the house.Sit down, Whatsup, and excuse me for a few moments.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位杰出的侦探走向挂在墙上的电话，耳朵贴着听筒站了大约十分钟时间。</td>
		<td class="en">The distinguished detective went to a wall telephone, and stood with the receiver to his ear for probably ten minutes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你刚才在听人自首么？”他一坐回到椅子上，我就问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Were you listening to a confession?”I asked, when he had returned to his chair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“或许吧，”乔尔摩斯微笑着说，“也可以说是差不多这一类的事情。说老实话，华笙，我已经停止服药了。长期以来，我一直都在加大药量，现在吗啡对我已经不起作用了。我需要点儿更有效的东西。刚才我听到的那个电话打到了沃尔多夫酒店的一个房间里，那儿正在举行一位作者的读书会。现在，我要找出这根细线的答案。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Perhaps,” said Jolnes, with a smile, “it might be called something of the sort.To be frank with you, Whatsup, I’ve cut out the dope.I’ve been increasing the quantity for so long that morphine doesn’t have much effect on me any more.I’ve got to have something more powerful.That telephone I just went to is connected with a room in the Waldorf where there’s an author’s reading in progress.Now, to get at the solution of this string.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沉思了五分钟后，乔尔摩斯看着我，微笑着点了点头。</td>
		<td class="en">After five minutes of silent pondering, Jolnes looked at me, with a smile, and nodded his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你简直不可思议！”我惊叹道，“已经弄懂了？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wonderful man!”I exclaimed; “already?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“相当简单，”他说着举起了手指，“你看到这个结了吗？那是用来防止我遗忘的。这么说来，这是一个‘勿忘我’结。勿忘我是一种花。就是说我要买回家的东西是一袋面粉！”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is quite simple,” he said, holding up his finger.“You see that knot?That is to prevent my forgetting.It is, therefore, a forget-me-knot.A forget-me-not is a flower.It was a sack of flour that I was to send home!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太妙了！”我不由赞叹道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Beautiful!”I could not help crying out in admiration.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不如我们出去走走吧，”乔尔摩斯建议道，</td>
		<td class="en">“Suppose we go out for a ramble,” suggested Jolnes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“眼下手头只剩一件重要的案子了。104岁的老头麦卡蒂因食用过多的香蕉而死。证据明显指向黑手党，警察已经包围了第二大道上的甘布赖纳斯‘宿醉’2号俱乐部。抓住凶手不过是几个小时的事而已。直到现在他们都没有请求侦探的帮助。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There is only one case of importance on hand just now.Old man McCarty, one hundred and four years old, died from eating too many bananas.The evidence points so strongly to the Mafia that the police have surrounded the Second Avenue Katzenjammer Gambrinus Club No.2, and the capture of the assassin is only the matter of a few hours.The detective force has not yet been called on for assistance.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我和乔尔摩斯出门上了街道，向拐角处走去，我们要在那里等电车。</td>
		<td class="en">Jolnes and I went out and up the street toward the corner, where we were to catch a surface car.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走到街区的半路上我们碰到了在市政厅供职的莱茵吉尔德，他是我们的老熟人。</td>
		<td class="en">Half-way up the block we met Rheingelder, an acquaintance of ours, who held a City Hall position.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好，莱茵吉尔德，”乔尔摩斯停下脚步，说道，</td>
		<td class="en">“Good morning, Rheingelder,” said Jolnes, halting.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你今天的早餐相当丰盛啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nice breakfast that was you had this morning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于我一向关注这位侦探卓越的推理技巧，我发现，当乔尔摩斯看到莱茵吉尔德衬衫胸前那条长长的黄渍和下巴上一小块同样的污迹时，他的眼睛闪了一下——毫无疑问，这两块都是蛋黄的污渍。</td>
		<td class="en">Always on the lookout for the detective’s remarkable feats of deduction, I saw Jolnes’s eye flash for an instant upon a long yellow splash on the shirt bosom and a smaller one upon the chin of Rheingelder—both undoubtedly made by the yolk of an egg.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，又是你那侦探的把戏。”莱茵吉尔德说着，笑得浑身直抖，“那好，我用美酒和雪茄打赌，你猜不出我早上都吃了些什么。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, dot is some of your detectiveness,” said Rheingelder, shaking all over with a smile.“Vell, I pet you trinks und cigars all round dot you cannot tell vot I haf eaten for breakfast.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“成交,”乔尔摩斯说道，“香肠、裸麦面包和咖啡。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Done,” said Jolnes.“Sausage, pumpernickel and coffee.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >莱茵吉尔德承认乔尔摩斯的推测是正确的，并付了酒钱和雪茄钱。我们继续往前走，我对乔尔摩斯说：“我想你观察的是沾在他下巴和前胸上鸡蛋的痕迹吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">Rheingelder admitted the correctness of the surmise and paid the bet.When we had proceeded on our way I said to Jolnes: “I thought you looked at the egg spilled on his chin and shirt front.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的,”乔尔摩斯说，“那正是我推理的切入点。莱茵吉尔德是一个精打细算的人。昨天市场上鸡蛋的价格下跌到每打28分。今天的报价是42分。莱茵吉尔德是在昨天吃的鸡蛋，今天他吃的又跟往常一样了。像这样的小事不算什么，华笙，这只是小学数学课上的内容而已。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I did,” said Jolnes.“That is where I began my deduction.Rheingelder is a very economical, saving man.Yesterday eggs dropped in the market to twenty-eight cents per dozen.To-day they are quoted at forty-two.Rheingelder ate eggs yesterday, and to-day he went back to his usual fare.A little thing like this isn’t anything, Whatsup; it belongs to the primary arithmetic class.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们上了电车，发现所有的座位都已经坐满了——坐着的大多是女士。我和乔尔摩斯站到了车厢后部。</td>
		<td class="en">When we boarded the street car we found the seats all occupied—principally by ladies.Jolnes and I stood on the rear platform.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一位留着短灰胡须的老人坐在车厢中部，衣着考究，看上去是一位典型的纽约人。在接下来的几个拐角处又上来几位女士，很快，便有三四位女士站在了那位男士跟前，紧紧抓着吊环，意味深长地盯着他，觊觎着他的座位。但他却坚决地坐着，不起身让座。</td>
		<td class="en">About the middle of the car there sat an elderly man with a short, gray beard, who looked to be the typical, well-dressed New Yorker.At successive corners other ladies climbed aboard, and soon three or four of them were standing over the man, clinging to straps and glaring meaningly at the man who occupied the coveted seat.But he resolutely retained his place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们纽约人，”我对乔尔摩斯说，“已经把礼貌都丢掉了，至少他们在公共场所表现如此。”</td>
		<td class="en">“We New Yorkers,” I remarked to Jolnes, “have about lost our manners, as far as the exercise of them in public goes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“或许是吧，”乔尔摩斯轻轻地说，“不过，你明确指出的那个人却恰好是位非常具有侠士风度、谦恭有礼的绅士，他来自历史悠久的弗吉尼亚州。他和妻子及两位女儿在纽约呆了几天，今晚正要启程回南方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Perhaps so,” said Jolnes, lightly; “but the man you evidently refer to happens to be a very chivalrous and courteous gentleman from Old Virginia.He is spending a few days in New York with his wife and two daughters, and he leaves for the South to-night.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，你认识他啰？”我惊讶地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You know him, then?”I said, in amazement.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“上车之前我从没见过他。”侦探微笑着澄清。</td>
		<td class="en">“I never saw him before we stepped on the car,” declared the detective, smilingly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“以恩道尔女巫金牙的名义发誓！”我喊道，“如果你仅依靠他的外表就能推测出这一切，你一定是在使用黑魔法。”</td>
		<td class="en">“By the gold tooth of the Witch of Endor!”I cried, “if you can construe all that from his appearance you are dealing in nothing else than black art.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“观察的习惯——仅此而已。”乔尔摩斯说，“如果那位老绅士在我们之前下车的话，我想我可以向你展示一下我推理的准确性。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The habit of observation—nothing more,” said Jolnes.“If the old gentleman gets off the car before we do, I think I can demonstrate to you the accuracy of my deduction.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >三站之后，那位绅士起身准备下车。乔尔摩斯站在门前与他攀谈起来：</td>
		<td class="en">Three blocks farther along the gentleman rose to leave the car.Jolnes addressed him at the door:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对不起，先生，你不是弗吉尼亚州诺福克郡的亨特上校吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pardon me, sir, but are you not Colonel Hunter, of Norfolk, Virginia?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是，”他极其礼貌地回答道，“我的名字叫做埃利森——温菲尔德·R. 埃利森少校，从弗吉尼亚州费尔法克斯郡来。我在诺福克认识很多人，先生——古德里奇一家、托利弗一家，还有克拉布特里一家，不过我还不曾有幸见到您的朋友亨特上校。很高兴告诉您，先生，我今晚要回弗吉尼亚了，我和我的妻子及三个女儿在贵城已经呆了将近一个星期了。大约十天之内，我就会回到诺福克郡，如果您肯把名字告诉我的话，先生，我很乐意去拜访亨特上校并转达您对他的关心。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, suh,” was the extremely courteous answer.“My name, suh, is Ellison—Major Winfield R. Ellison, from Fairfax County, in the same state.I know a good many people, suh, in Norfolk—the Goodriches, the Tollivers, and the Crabtrees, suh, but I never had the pleasure of meeting yo’ friend, Colonel Hunter.I am happy to say, suh, that I am going back to Virginia to-night, after having spent a week in yo’ city with my wife and three daughters.I shall be in Norfolk in about ten days, and if you will give me yo’ name, suh, I will take pleasure in looking up Colonel Hunter and telling him that you inquired after him, suh.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谢谢，”乔尔摩斯说，“如果您真的好心找到他，请转告一声，雷诺兹向他问好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Thank you,” said Jolnes; “tell him that Reynolds sent his regards, if you will be so kind.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我注视着那位纽约的大侦探，发现他轮廓清晰的脸庞上闪过了一丝非常懊恼的神色。哪怕是一丁点儿的失败也会让沙姆罗克·乔尔摩斯感到烦恼。</td>
		<td class="en">I glanced at the great New York detective and saw that a look of intense chagrin had come upon his clear-cut features.Failure in the slightest point always galled Shamrock Jolnes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你刚才说你有三个女儿？”他向那位弗吉尼亚绅士问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did you say your three daughters?” he asked of the Virginia gentleman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，先生，三个女儿，她们全都和费尔法克斯郡其他的女子一样优秀。”他答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, suh, my three daughters, all as fine girls as there are in Fairfax County,” was the answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说到这，埃利森少校叫停了车子，准备下车。</td>
		<td class="en">With that Major Ellison stopped the car and began to descend the step.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沙姆罗克·乔尔摩斯抓住了他的手臂。</td>
		<td class="en">Shamrock Jolnes clutched his arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“稍等，先生，”他用一种彬彬有礼的音调恳求道，只有我能嗅出其中的急切——“您有一位女儿是收养的，我没说错吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“One moment, sir,” he begged, in an urbane voice in which I alone detected the anxiety—“am I not right in believing that one of the young ladies is an adopted daughter?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，先生，”已经下车的少校承认道，“但是我真的搞不懂你是怎么知道的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are, suh,” admitted the major, from the ground, “but how the devil you knew it, suh, is mo’ than I can tell.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也搞不懂。”车子发动时，我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“And mo’ than I can tell, too,” I said, as the car went on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔尔摩斯纠正了他明显的错误，反败为胜，恢复了那镇定而善于观察的神色。于是，我们下车后，他邀请我去咖啡馆，并保证向我透露刚才精彩推理的来龙去脉。</td>
		<td class="en">Jolnes was restored to his calm, observant serenity by having wrested victory from his apparent failure; so after we got off the car he invited me into a café, promising to reveal the process of his latest wonderful feat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“首先，”我们舒舒服服地坐下以后，他开始说道，“我知道那位绅士不是纽约人，因为虽然他并未起身让座，但那些站着的女士们让他面红耳赤，焦躁不安。我从他的外貌可以断定，他来自南部，而不是西部。</td>
		<td class="en">“In the first place,” he began after we were comfortably seated, “I knew the gentleman was no New Yorker because he was flushed and uneasy and restless on account of the ladies that were standing, although he did not rise and give them his seat.I decided from his appearance that he was a Southerner rather than a Westerner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其次，他明明很清楚自己需要让座，但依然忍住没有让，我开始思考他这样做的原因。很快我就明白了。我发现他的一只眼角被严重刺伤，有些红肿发炎，而且他的脸上布满了细小的圆印，大概有没削过的铅笔头那么大。而他的两只黑漆皮鞋上都有许多很深的凹痕，像是椭圆的截面印上去的。</td>
		<td class="en">“Next I began to figure out his reason for not relinquishing his seat to a lady when he evidently felt strongly, but not overpoweringly, impelled to do so.I very quickly decided upon that.I noticed that one of his eyes had received a severe jab in one corner, which was red and inflamed, and that all over his face were tiny round marks about the size of the end of an uncut lead pencil.Also upon both of his patent leather shoes were a number of deep imprints shaped like ovals cut off square at one end.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，纽约城里只有一个地方，能让男士身上出现那种伤痕和印记——那就是二十三街的人行道上，第六大道南面的一带。他脚上的是法式鞋跟印，脸上被购物区的妇女随身带的雨伞和阳伞戳出了无数的伤痕，我从这些痕迹可以看出他刚刚与勇猛的女子大军搏斗过。但是从他聪明的外表来看，他不会冒这样的险，除非他是被自己的女眷硬拖着去的。他上车时正为自己所受到的待遇气愤不已，因此他虽然有着南方的侠士传统，却还是不肯让出自己的座位。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, there is only one district in New York City where a man is bound to receive scars and wounds and indentations of that sort—and that is along the sidewalks of Twenty-third Street and a portion of Sixth Avenue south of there.I knew from the imprints of trampling French heels on his feet and the marks of countless jabs in the face from umbrellas and parasols carried by women in the shopping district that he had been in conflict with the amazonian troops.And as he was a man of intelligent appearance, I knew he would not have braved such dangers unless he had been dragged thither by his own women folk.Therefore, when he got on the car his anger at the treatment he had received was sufficient to make him keep his seat in spite of his traditions of Southern chivalry.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那些都很妙，”我说，“但你为何坚持认为是女儿呢——而且还是两个女儿？为什么不能是妻子自己拉着他去购物呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“That is all very well,” I said, “but why did you insist upon daughters—and especially two daughters?Why couldn’t a wife alone have taken him shopping?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一定是女儿，”乔尔摩斯平静地说，“如果他只有妻子，并且妻子与他年纪相仿，那么他一定能够哄着她自己去购物。如果他妻子很年轻，那她宁愿自己单独去。所以，他一定有女儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There had to be daughters,” said Jolnes, calmly.“If he had only a wife, and she near his own age, he could have bluffed her into going alone.If he had a young wife she would prefer to go alone.So there you are.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我同意，”我说，“但是为什么是两个女儿？并且，当他告诉你他有三个女儿的时候，以所有先知者的名义，你是如何猜出他有个女儿是收养的呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll admit that,” I said; “but, now, why two daughters?And how, in the name of all the prophets, did you guess that one was adopted when he told you he had three?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别说是猜的，”乔尔摩斯说道，言语间露出一丝骄傲，“在推理的词典里没有这样的字眼。在埃利森少校的西服翻领处，别着一朵康乃馨和一朵天竺葵叶衬托下的玫瑰花蕾。不会有女士把康乃馨和玫瑰花蕾一起别在翻领上的。闭上眼睛，华笙，给你一个逻辑想象的机会。你难道想象不出可爱的阿黛尔正把康乃馨别在爸爸的领子上，让他在街上显得年轻帅气？然后，顽皮的伊迪丝蹦蹦跳跳地过来，带着一丝嫉妒似的把自己的玫瑰花蕾也插了上去？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t say guess,” said Jolnes, with a touch of pride in his air; “there is no such word in the lexicon of ratiocination.In Major Ellison’s buttonhole there was a carnation and a rosebud backed by a geranium leaf.No woman ever combined a carnation and a rosebud into a boutonniere.Close your eyes, Whatsup, and give the logic of your imagination a chance.Cannot you see the lovely Adele fastening the carnation to the lapel so that papa may be gay upon the street?And then the romping Edith May dancing up with sisterly jealousy to add her rosebud to the adornment?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“然后，”我叫道，开始有些兴奋，“当他说他有三个女儿的时候——”</td>
		<td class="en">“And then,” I cried, beginning to feel enthusiasm, “when he declared that he had three daughters—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我能看到，”乔尔摩斯说，“一个女儿站在后面，没有把花别上来；我知道她必定是——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I could see,” said Jolnes, “one in the background who added no flower; and I knew that she must be—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“收养的！”我接口道，“这些我都非常相信；但是你怎么知道他今晚就要去南部呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Adopted!”I broke in. “I give you every credit; but how did you know he was leaving for the South to-night?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他胸前的口袋，”大侦探说道，“是鼓起来的，里面有个大大的椭圆形物体。火车上没什么好酒，从纽约到费尔法克斯郡可是相当远的旅程。”</td>
		<td class="en">“In his breast pocket,” said the great detective, “something large and oval made a protuberance.Good liquor is scarce on trains, and it is a long journey from New York to Fairfax County.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我又一次对您佩服得五体投地了，”我说。“告诉我这一点，那么我的最后的一点儿疑问都会消失；告诉我您是怎么知道他是从弗吉尼亚来的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Again, I must bow to you,” I said.“And tell me this, so that my last shred of doubt will be cleared away; why did you decide that he was from Virginia?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我承认这一点确实很不明显，”沙姆罗克·乔尔摩斯回答道，“但是训练有素的侦探是不会闻不出车里的薄荷味的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It was very faint, I admit,” answered Shamrock Jolnes, “but no trained observer could have failed to detect the odour of mint in the car.”</td></tr>
