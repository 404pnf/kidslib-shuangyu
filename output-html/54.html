		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰·德格拉芬里德·阿特伍德爱吃莲，莲藕、莲茎、莲花他都吃。热带气候把他整个吞噬了。他满腔热情地投入到工作中，为的是忘掉罗西娜。</td>
		<td class="en">John De Graffenreid Atwood ate of the lotus, root, stem, and flower.The tropics gobbled him up.He plunged enthusiastically into his work, which was to try to forget Rosine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如今，食莲者很少单单吃莲。他们会搭配着喝一种只有魔鬼才喝的烈酒；酒是厨师自己酿的。在约翰尼的菜单上，这种酒被称为“白兰地”。晚上，他和比利·基奥习惯坐在小领事馆的门廊里，中间放瓶酒，痛快地吼上几支不雅的歌曲，直吼得过路的当地人一边耸肩，嘴里咕哝着“恶魔美国佬”，一边慌不择路地溜走。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, they who dine on the lotus rarely consume it plain.There is a sauce au diable that goes with it; and the distillers are the chefs who prepare it.And on Johnny’s menu card it read “brandy.”With a bottle between them, he and Billy Keogh would sit on the porch of the little consulate at night and roar out great, indecorous songs, until the natives, slipping hastily past, would shrug a shoulder and mutter things to themselves about the “Americanos diablos.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这天，约翰尼的听差取回邮件，把它们一股脑儿倒在桌子上。约翰尼从吊床上探过身，沮丧地翻弄着这四五封信。一只蜈蚣正在文具中间爬行；基奥坐在桌边，懒洋洋地用一把裁纸刀切着蜈蚣的腿。约翰尼正处于吃莲的一定阶段——在这一阶段，世上除莲之外的所有食物对他来说都难以下咽。</td>
		<td class="en">One day Johnny’s mozo brought the mail and dumped it on the table.Johnny leaned from his hammock, and fingered the four or five letters dejectedly.Keogh was sitting on the edge of the table chopping lazily with a paper knife at the legs of a centipede that was crawling among the stationery.Johnny was in that phase of lotus-eating when all the world tastes bitter in one’s mouth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“又来了！”他抱怨道，“一群傻瓜写信来问这个国家的情况。他们想知道种植果树的全部情况，还有怎样才能不用工作就赚大钱。他们当中一半的人甚至都不知道附上回信的邮票。他们认为领事除了写信没别的事干。给我把信撕开，老兄，看看他们想干什么。我头晕得动不了了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Same old thing!” he complained.“Fool people writing for information about the country.They want to know all about raising fruit, and how to make a fortune without work.Half of ’em don’t even send stamps for a reply.They think a consul hasn’t anything to do but write letters.Slit those envelopes for me, old man, and see what they want.I’m feeling too rocky to move.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基奥已经适应了环境，不受任何坏情绪影响；他把椅子拉到桌边，红润的脸庞上挂着顺从的微笑，开始拆信。有四封是美国各地的公民写来的，看来他们是把科拉里奥的领事当成了一本资讯百科全书。他们提出一大串一大串的问题，还一一编了号，询问领事馆所在国的气候、物产、发展前景、法律、生意机会，以及各种统计数据。在这个国家，领事馆光荣地代表着本国政府。</td>
		<td class="en">Keogh, acclimated beyond all possibility of ill-humor, drew his chair to the table with smiling compliance on his rose-pink countenance, and began to slit open the letters.Four of them were from citizens in various parts of the United States who seemed to regard the consul at Coralio as a cyclopedia of information.They asked long lists of questions, numerically arranged, about the climate, products, possibilities, laws, business chances, and statistics of the country in which the consul had the honor of representing his own government.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请给他们回信，比利，”领事懒懒地说，“只写一句，让他们查阅领事馆的最新报告。跟他们说，州政府会很乐意提供珍贵的文字资料。签我的名。别让你的笔发出嚓嚓声，比利；那样我睡不着。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Write ’em, please, Billy,” said that inert official, “just a line, referring them to the latest consular report.Tell ’em the State Department will be delighted to furnish the literary gems.Sign my name.Don’t let your pen scratch, Billy; it’ll keep me awake.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别打呼噜啊，”基奥的语气很亲切，“我来替你写。无论如何，总得有一队助手帮你做事。就没见你自己完成过一篇报告。等一下，醒醒——这儿还有一封信——还是从你家乡寄来的呢——戴尔斯堡？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t snore,” said Keogh, amiably, “and I’ll do your work for you.You need a corps of assistants, anyhow.Don’t see how you ever get out a report.Wake up a minute—here’s one more letter—it’s from your own town, too—?Dalesburg.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是吗？”约翰尼低声咕哝着，仿佛是出于义务，不得不对此略表兴趣，“信上都写些什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“That so?” murmured Johnny showing a mild and obligatory interest.“What’s it about?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是邮局局长写来的，”基奥解释说，“说镇上一个公民想向你咨询些情况，并请你提点建议。还说这个公民打算来你这儿开家鞋店。他想知道，你是否觉得这生意有钱可赚。因为他听说沿海这边经济发展很快，想捷足先登，抓住有利时机。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Postmaster writes,” explained Keogh.“Says a citizen of the town wants some facts and advice from you.Says the citizen has an idea in his head of coming down where you are and opening a shoe store.Wants to know if you think the business would pay.Says he’s heard of the boom along this coast, and wants to get in on the ground floor.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然天气炎热，心情烦躁，约翰尼还是忍不住大笑起来，吊床都跟着晃晃悠悠。基奥也大笑起来；书柜顶层的宠物猴吱吱尖叫着，对戴尔斯堡来信受到的讽刺性待遇深表同情。</td>
		<td class="en">In spite of the heat and his bad temper, Johnny’s hammock swayed with his laughter.Keogh laughed too; and the pet monkey on the top shelf of the bookcase chattered in shrill sympathy with the ironical reception of the letter from Dalesburg.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真是有病！”领事大叫，“鞋店！真不知他们下一个问题是什么。我估计该问大衣厂了吧。喂，比利——我们这儿的三千居民当中，你说有几个人穿过鞋子？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Great bunions!” exclaimed the consul.“Shoe store!What’ll they ask about next, I wonder?Overcoat factory, I reckon.Say, Billy—of our 3,000 citizens, how many do you suppose ever had on a pair of shoes?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基奥一本正经地思索着。</td>
		<td class="en">Keogh reflected judicially.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“咱们算算——有你，我，还有——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Let’s see—there’s you and me and—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不算，”约翰尼马上说，一边抬起一只脚，上面套着只破烂不堪的鹿皮鞋；看来他的说法并不准确。“我已经好几个月没受过穿鞋之苦了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not me,” said Johnny, promptly and incorrectly, holding up a foot encased in a disreputable deerskin zapato.“I haven’t been a victim to shoes in months.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可你终归是有鞋啊，”基奥接着说，“还有古德温、布兰查德、格迪、老卢茨、格雷格医生，还有那个意大利人——香蕉公司的代理商，还有老德尔加多——不对，他穿的是凉鞋。还有，哦，对啦对啦，还有奥尔蒂斯太太，‘这饭店可怎么管呀’——不久前的一个晚上，她穿了双红色小山羊皮舞鞋参加舞会。还有帕萨小姐，她在美国念书的女儿——带回一些关于鞋袜的文明观念。还有司令官的妹妹，每次赴宴都把脚丫子装扮一番——还有格迪太太，她穿卡斯蒂利亚样式的鞋——女士大概就这么多啦。再想想——军营里的一些士兵难道不——不对，不是这样；他们只在行军时才允许穿鞋。在营房，他们都把小小的脚趾头放出来吃草。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But you’ve got ’em, though,” went on Keogh.“And there’s Goodwin and Blanchard and Geddie and old Lutz and Doc Gregg and that Italian that’s agent for the banana company, and there’s old Delgado—no; he wears sandals.And, oh, yes; there’s Madama Ortiz, ‘what kapes the hotel’—she had on a pair of red kid slippers at the baile the other night.And Miss Pasa, her daughter, that went to school in the States—she brought back some civilized notions in the way of footgear.And there’s the comandante’s sister that dresses up her feet on feast-days—and Mrs. Geddie, who wears a two with a Castilian instep—and that’s about all the ladies.Let’s see—don’t some of the soldiers at the cuartel—no: that’s so; they’re allowed shoes only when on the march.In barracks they turn their little toeses out to grass.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“差不多吧。”领事表示赞同，“在这三千人中，只有不超过二十个人走路时脚上穿过皮革制品。嗬，是呀，科拉里奥城正适合开一家敢于冒险的鞋店——一家不想卖掉货的鞋店。真不知道老帕特森是不是在逗我开心呢！他总有一肚子他称之为笑话的玩意儿。给他写封信，比利。我口述。我们也逗逗他。”</td>
		<td class="en">“’Bout right,” agreed the consul.“Not over twenty out of the three thousand ever felt leather on their walking arrangements.Oh, yes; Coralio is just the town for an enterprising shoe store—that doesn’t want to part with its goods.Wonder if old Patterson is trying to jolly me!He always was full of things he called jokes.Write him a letter, Billy.I’ll dictate it.We’ll jolly him back a few.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基奥蘸了蘸墨水，开始按约翰尼的口述写回信。其间他们停顿了很多次，抽了很多烟，喝了大大小小很多瓶酒，终于炮制出了下面这封写往戴尔斯堡的回信：</td>
		<td class="en">Keogh dipped his pen, and wrote at Johnny’s dictation.With many pauses, filled in with smoke and sundry travellings of the bottle and glasses, the following reply to the Dalesburg communication was perpetrated:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >奥巴代亚·帕特森先生，戴尔斯堡，亚拉巴马</td>
		<td class="en">MR. OBADIAH PATTERSON, Dalesburg, Ala.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >亲爱的先生：七月二日函至，承蒙厚爱，感激之至，谨此作复。我倍感荣幸地告知您，依愚之见，在我们居住的星球上，再无一地比科拉里奥城更需一家一流鞋店。有事实为证：此地有居民三千，却无鞋店一间！情况不言而喻。近来，大群开拓进取之商人纷纷抢滩沿海市场，鞋业却惨遭忽视，无人涉足，实为可惜。事实上，目前本地无鞋可穿之居民，数目的确可观。</td>
		<td class="en">Dear Sir: in reply to your favor of July 2d.I have the honor to inform you that, according to my opinion, there is no place on the habitable globe that presents to the eye stronger evidence of the need of a first-class shoe store than does the town of Coralio.There are 3,000 inhabitants in the place, and not a single shoe store!The situation speaks for itself.This coast is rapidly becoming the goal of enterprising business men, but the shoe business is one that has been sadly overlooked or neglected.In fact, there are a considerable number of our citizens actually without shoes at present.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除上述需求之外，本地尚亟需一家酿酒厂、一所高等数学院、一家煤场和一座整洁、高品位的木偶剧场。承蒙关照，荣幸之至。</td>
		<td class="en">Besides the want above mentioned, there is also a crying need for a brewery, a college of higher mathematics, a coal yard, and a clean and intellectual Punch and Judy show.I have the honor to be, sir,</td></tr>

		<td class="en">U.S. CONSUL AT CORALIO. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >附言——你好啊！奥巴代亚大叔。咱们的老城咋样啊？要是缺了你和我，政府该咋办呀？等着吧，你很快就会收到一只绿头鹦鹉和一串香蕉，它们来自你的老朋友——</td>
		<td class="en">P.S.—Hello!Uncle Obadiah.How’s the old burg racking along?What would the government do without you and me?Look out for a green-headed parrot and a bunch of bananas soon, from your old friend</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰尼</td>
		<td class="en">Johnny.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我加上那段附言，”领事解释道，“奥巴代亚大叔就不会因这封信的官腔生气了！好啦，比利，把这封信封好，让潘乔送到邮局去。如果他们今天能把水果装上船，明天阿里阿德涅号就能把信带走了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I throw in that postscript,” explained the consul, “so Uncle Obadiah won’t take offense at the official tone of the letter!Now, Billy, you get that correspondence fixed up, and send Pancho to the post-office with it.The Ariadne takes the mail out tomorrow if they make up that load of fruit today.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >科拉里奥的夜间节目一成不变。当地人的消遣方式令人昏昏欲睡，无精打采。他们光着脚，低声说着话，抽着雪茄或香烟，漫无目的地东游西逛。俯视灯光昏暗的小路，你仿佛看到一串黑头发、棕皮肤的幽灵组成的迷魂阵，中间夹杂着一队队乱飞乱撞的萤火虫。一些房子里传来信手拨弄的吉他声，那声音阴郁低沉，给这沉闷的夜晚平添几分忧伤。巨大的树蛙在树叶间发出响亮的格格声，听起来很像巡回剧团里的滑稽演员在敲响板。到了九点，街上就几乎一个人影也没有了。</td>
		<td class="en">The night programme in Coralio never varied.The recreations of the people were soporific and flat.They wandered about, barefoot and aimless, speaking lowly and smoking cigar or cigarette.Looking down on the dimly lighted ways one seemed to see a threading maze of brunette ghosts tangled with a procession of insane fireflies.In some houses the thrumming of lugubrious guitars added to the depression of the triste night.Giant tree-frogs rattled in the foliage as loudly as the end man’s “bones” in a minstrel troupe.By nine o’clock the streets were almost deserted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >领事馆的夜间节目也鲜有变化。基奥每晚都会来，因为那座官邸的小小门廊堪称科拉里奥的一片清凉之地。</td>
		<td class="en">Not at the consulate was there often a change of bill.Keogh would come there nightly, for Coralio’s one cool place was the little porch of that official residence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >推杯换盏之间，白兰地不停流淌；还没到午夜，伤感就向这位自我放逐的领事内心袭来。于是，领事就会向基奥述说他那业已结束的浪漫故事。每天晚上，基奥都会耐心听他讲故事，随时准备着大发同情，而且乐此不疲。</td>
		<td class="en">The brandy would be kept moving; and before midnight sentiment would begin to stir in the heart of the self-exiled consul.Then he would relate to Keogh the story of his ended romance.Each night Keogh would listen patiently to the tale, and be ready with untiring sympathy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过，”——约翰尼总是这样结束他痛彻心扉的叙述——“你可千万别以为我会为那女孩伤心，比利。我已经把她忘了。她再也不会走进我的脑海。即使她现在就踏进这扇门，我的脉搏也不会加快一拍。那都是很久以前的事儿了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But don’t you think for a minute”—thus Johnny would always conclude his woeful narrative—“that I’m grieving about that girl, Billy.I’ve forgotten her.She never enters my mind.If she were to enter that door right now, my pulse wouldn’t gain a beat.That’s all over long ago.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我怎么会不知道呢？”基奥会说，“你当然已经忘了她了。就应该这样。那个——呃——那个丁克·波森总说你坏话，她可真不该听信他的谗言。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t I know it?” Keogh would answer.“Of course you’ve forgotten her.Proper thing to do.Wasn’t quite O.K. of her to listen to the knocks  that—er—Dink Pawson kept giving you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“平克·道森！”——约翰尼的语气里充满了轻蔑——“穷白鬼！他就是个穷白鬼。不过他有五百英亩农田；这倒挺了不起。说不定哪天我能找到机会报复他。道森家的人都算什么呀。亚拉巴马州的每一个人可都知道阿特伍德家族。喂，比利——你知不知道我母亲的娘家是德格拉芬里德家族？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pink Dawson!”—a word of contempt would be in Johnny’s tones—“Poor white trash!That’s what he was.Had five hundred acres of farming land, though; and that counted.Maybe I’ll have a chance to get back at him some day.The Dawsons weren’t anybody.Everybody in Alabama knows the Atwoods.Say, Billy—did you know my mother was a De Graffenreid?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呦，不知道啊，”基奥会说，“真的吗？”其实他已经听过大概三百遍了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, no,” Keogh would say; “is that so?”He had heard it some three hundred times.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对啊。汉考克县的德格拉芬里德家族。但我再也不会想那个女孩了，对吧，比利？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Fact.The De Graffenreids of Hancock County.But I never think of that girl any more, do I, Billy?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一分钟也不会想啦，老弟。”约翰尼——这位丘比特的征服者最后听到的总是这句话。</td>
		<td class="en">“Not for a minute, my boy,” would be the last sounds heard by the conqueror of Cupid.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，约翰尼会缓缓进入恬静的睡眠状态；基奥便悠然走回广场边葫芦树下他自己的小木屋里。</td>
		<td class="en">At this point Johnny would fall into a gentle slumber, and Keogh would saunter out to his own shack under the calabash tree at the edge of the plaza.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不出一两天，这两个客居科拉里奥的人就把戴尔斯堡邮局局长的来信还有他们的回信抛到脑后了。但是，七月二十六日这天，那封回信惹出的事端清清楚楚摆在了他们眼前。</td>
		<td class="en">In a day or two the letter from the Dalesburg postmaster and its answer had been forgotten by the Coralio exiles.But on the 26th day of July the fruit of the reply appeared upon the tree of events.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >安达多尔号，这艘定期来科拉里奥运水果的轮船，缓缓驶入人们的视线，靠岸抛锚。检疫医生和海关工作人员划着驳船前去执行公务时，海滩上已经站满了看热闹的人。　</td>
		<td class="en">The Andador, a fruit steamer that visited Coralio regularly, drew into the offing and anchored.The beach was lined with spectators while the quarantine doctor and the custom-house crew rowed out to attend to their duties.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一小时后，比利·基奥穿着亚麻布衣服懒洋洋地踱进领事馆，看起来干净清爽，像一只满心欢喜的鲨鱼一样咧嘴笑着。“猜猜出什么事啦？”他朝懒懒躺在吊床上的约翰尼问道。</td>
		<td class="en">An hour later Billy Keogh lounged into the consulate, clean and cool in his linen clothes, and grinning like a pleased shark.“Guess what?” he said to Johnny, lounging in his hammock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太热啦，不想猜。”约翰尼慢吞吞地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Too hot to guess,” said Johnny, lazily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你那开鞋店的人来啦，”基奥边说边把一小块糖在舌头上滚来滚去，“带来一大批货，连大陆最南端火地岛的人都不愁没鞋穿啦。他们正把一箱箱的货往海关运。满满六驳船的货已经被搬上岸了，他们又划船回去取剩余的货了。啊，荣耀的圣者啊！当他识破玩笑，跑来与领事大人面谈时，可就有一场好戏看喽。能赶上那个逗趣儿的场面，在这热带地区熬九年也值啦。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Your shoe-store man’s come,” said Keogh, rolling the sweet morsel on his tongue, “with a stock of goods big enough to supply the continent as far down as Tierra del Fuego.They’re carting his cases over to the custom-house now.Six barges full they brought ashore and have paddled back for the rest.Oh, ye saints in glory! won’t there be regalements in the air when he gets onto the joke and has an interview with Mr.Consul?It’ll be worth nine years in the tropics just to witness that one joyful moment.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基奥总能毫不费力地找到乐子。他在地上的席子上选了块干净的地方，躺了下来。墙壁仿佛都被他的快乐感染了，开始摇晃起来。约翰尼半转过身，眨了眨眼睛。</td>
		<td class="en">Keogh loved to take his mirth easily.He selected a clean place on the matting and lay upon the floor.The walls shook with his enjoyment.Johnny turned half over and blinked.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Didn’t tell me,” he said, “that anybody was fool enough to take that letter seriously.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“四千美元的货啊！”基奥兴奋地喘着气说，“相当于往纽卡斯尔运煤啊！既然他这么喜欢干荒唐的事，干吗不运一船棕榈叶扇子到斯匹次卑尔根群岛呢？我在海滩上瞅见那个怪老头啦。他戴上眼镜，眯着眼打量着周围那大约五百个赤脚市民；你真该看看他那副样子。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Four-thousand-dollar stock of goods!” gasped Keogh, in ecstasy.“Talk about coals to Newcastle!Why didn’t he take a ship-load of palm-leaf fans to Spitzenbergen while he was about it?Saw the old codger on the beach.You ought to have been there when he put on his specs and squinted at the five hundred or so barefooted citizens standing around.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在海关大楼墙外的背阴处，他找到了赫姆斯特特尔先生和罗西娜，两人被一大群瞠目结舌的本地居民团团围住。海关人员一边避开人群，一边拖着脚往后退，安达多尔号的船长则在向民众解释新来的这两位是做什么生意的。罗西娜看上去身体健康，充满活力。她饶有兴味地盯着眼前这奇怪的场面，似乎觉得有点可笑。当她和昔日的爱慕者打招呼时，圆圆的脸颊上泛起了淡淡的红晕。赫姆斯特特尔先生非常友善地同约翰尼握手。他是个不切实际的老头——是众多不安分的生意人当中的一个；这类人从不满足，永远都在寻求变化。</td>
		<td class="en">In the shade of the custom-house walls he found Mr. Hemstetter and Rosine surrounded by a mass of gaping citizens.The customs officers were ducking and scraping, while the captain of the Andador interpreted the business of the new arrivals.Rosine looked healthy and very much alive.She was gazing at the strange scenes around her with amused interest.There was a faint blush upon her round cheek as she greeted her old admirer.Mr. Hemstetter shook hands with Johnny in a very friendly way.He was an oldish, impractical man—one of that numerous class of erratic business men who are forever dissatisfied, and seeking a change.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很高兴见到你，约翰——我可以叫你约翰吗？”他问，“谢谢您那么快就回复了邮局局长那封信，解答了我的疑问。他自愿替我给你写信。我当时正在寻找时机，想转行做点更赚钱的生意。我注意到报上说这一带的海滨很受投资者关注。你建议我来这里，我真是感激不尽。我变卖了所有资产，用来买鞋；我的货是北美最好的。约翰，你们这座小城真是风景如画啊。我对这桩生意满怀期待，收到你的信，更像吃了颗定心丸。我希望生意能像你信中说的那么好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am very glad to see you, John—may I call you John?” he said.“Let me thank you for your prompt answer to our postmaster’s letter of inquiry.He volunteered to write to you on my behalf.I was looking about for something different in the way of a business in which the profits would be greater.I had noticed in the papers that this coast was receiving much attention from investors.I am extremely grateful for your advice to come.I sold out everything that I possess, and invested the proceeds in as fine a stock of shoes as could be bought in the North.You have a picturesque town here, John.I hope business will be as good as your letter justifies me in expecting.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基奥的到来解救了备受煎熬的约翰尼。他急急忙忙赶来，说古德温太太非常乐意提供房间，听凭赫姆斯特特尔先生和他女儿使用。于是，赫姆斯特特尔先生和罗西娜立刻被领去休息，以消除海上航行的疲乏；约翰尼则去看看那些装满鞋子的货箱是否已安全地放入了海关仓库，等候官员检查。基奥呢，仍像鲨鱼似的咧嘴笑着，四处寻找古德温，告诉他先不要向赫姆斯特特尔先生透露科拉里奥鞋类市场的真实状况，好让约翰尼找机会挽回局面——如果可能的话。</td>
		<td class="en">Johnny’s agony was abbreviated by the arrival of Keogh, who hurried up with the news that Mrs. Goodwin would be much pleased to place rooms at the disposal of Mr. Hemstetter and his daughter.So there Mr. Hemstetter and Rosine were at once conducted and left to recuperate from the fatigue of the voyage, while Johnny went down to see that the cases of shoes were safely stored in the customs warehouse pending their examination by the officials.Keogh, grinning like a shark, skirmished about to find Goodwin, to instruct him not to expose to Mr. Hemstetter the true state of Coralio as a shoe market until Johnny had been given a chance to redeem the situation, if such a thing were possible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天晚上，领事和基奥在微风习习的领事馆门廊里召开了一次紧急磋商会议。</td>
		<td class="en">That night the consul and Keogh held a desperate consultation on the breezy porch of the consulate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“打发他们回家吧。”基奥先开口，似乎猜透了约翰尼的心思。</td>
		<td class="en">“Send ’em back home,” began Keogh, reading Johnny’s thoughts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我会的。”约翰尼沉默了片刻，说道，“但是我一直都在对你撒谎，比利。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I would,” said Johnny, after a little silence; “but I’ve been lying to you, Billy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这有什么啊。”基奥和颜悦色地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“All right about that,” said Keogh, affably.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我告诉过你好几百遍，”约翰尼缓缓地说，“我已经把那姑娘忘记了，不是吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ve told you hundreds of times,” said Johnny, slowly, “that I had forgotten that girl, haven’t I?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“大概有三百七十五遍吧。”“耐心纪念碑”承认道。</td>
		<td class="en">“About three hundred and seventy-five,” admitted the monument of patience.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我在说谎，”领事重复道，“每次都是。我一刻也没忘记过她。就因为她说了一次‘不’，我就像一只倔强的蠢驴落荒而逃了。我就是个傻瓜，我太高傲了，所以不肯回头。今晚在古德温家，我和罗西娜谈了几分钟。我有一个发现。你还记得那个对她穷追不舍的乡巴佬吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I lied,” repeated the consul, “every time.I never forgot her for one moment.I was an obstinate ass for running away just because she said ‘No’ once.And I was too proud a fool to go back.I talked with Rosine a few minutes this evening up at Goodwin’s.I found out one thing.You remember that farmer fellow who was always after her?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“丁克·波森？”基奥问。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“平克·道森。嘿嘿，她说她一点儿也瞧不上他。他说我的那些坏话，她说她一个字都不相信。但现在，我完了，比利。我们寄出的那封愚蠢至极的信把我剩余的机会全毁掉了。如果她发现她老爸竟然成了一个玩笑的牺牲品，肯定会看不起我的，因为有教养的男生是不会这样搞恶作剧的。鞋啊！如果他在科拉里奥开上二十年的店，倒是能卖掉二十双鞋吧。假如你给一个加勒比佬或者拉美小黑孩穿上鞋子，他会怎样？他会头朝下倒立，大声尖叫，直到把鞋子蹬掉为止。他们谁都没有穿过鞋，以后也不会穿。如果打发罗西娜父女俩回家，我就必须把事情的原委一五一十告诉他们，那她会怎么看我啊？我比从前更渴望得到这位姑娘了，比利；可是现在她近在咫尺，我却永远地失去了她。就因为我想在102度的高温之下找点乐子，结果酿成了大错。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pink Dawson.Well, he wasn’t a hill of beans to her.She says she didn’t believe a word of the things he told her about me.But I’m sewed up now, Billy.That tomfool letter we sent ruined whatever chance I had left.She’ll despise me when she finds out that her old father has been made the victim of a joke that a decent schoolboy wouldn’t have been guilty of.Shoes!Why he couldn’t sell twenty pairs of shoes in Coralio if he kept store here for twenty years.You put a pair of shoes on one of these Caribs or Spanish brown boys and what’d he do?Stand on his head and squeal until he’d kicked ’em off.None of ’em ever wore shoes and they never will.If I send ’em back home I’ll have to tell the whole story, and what’ll she think of me?I want that girl worse than ever, Billy, and now when she’s in reach I’ve lost her forever because I tried to be funny when the thermometer was at 102.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“开心点，”乐观的基奥说，“就让他们开店呗。今天下午我一直在忙活。不管怎样，咱们可以掀起一阵鞋袜热。鞋店开张时，我买六双。我四处转了转，找了所有的熟人，向他们解释了咱们闯下的大祸。他们到时候都会像蜈蚣一样，买很多鞋子回家。弗兰克·古德温会买好几箱。格迪一家大概需要十一双。克兰西会把几个星期的积蓄换成鞋，连老格雷格医生都说，要是他们有十几美元的便宜货，他倒挺想买三双鳄鱼皮拖鞋哩。布兰查德曾一睹赫姆斯特特尔小姐的芳容，似乎对她十分倾慕；况且他是法国佬，没有一打鞋子怎么行呀。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Keep cheerful,” said the optimistic Keogh.“And let ’em open the store.I’ve been busy myself this afternoon.We can stir up a temporary boom in foot-gear anyhow.I’ll buy six pairs when the doors open.I’ve been around and seen all the fellows and explained the catastrophe.They’ll all buy shoes like they was centipedes.Frank Goodwin will take cases of ’em.The Geddies want about eleven pairs between ’em.Clancy is going to invest the savings of weeks, and even old Doc Gregg wants three pairs of alligator-hide slippers if they’ve got any tens.Blanchard got a look at Miss Hemstetter; and as he’s a Frenchman, no less than a dozen pairs will do for him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这才十来个买主，”约翰尼说，“可有四千美元的货呢！还是不顶用啊。这里面有一个大问题要解决。你回家吧，比利，我一个人呆会儿。我得独自把这个问题解决。把那瓶三星酒拎走吧——是的，先生，美利坚合众国的领事今夜将滴酒不沾。今晚我要坐在这儿，想出一个对策。只要发现这件事有任何突破口，我都会抓住它。如果找不到突破口，又一叶小舟将会葬身于这片美丽的热带海洋。</td>
		<td class="en">“A dozen customers,” said Johnny, “for a $4,000 stock of shoes!It won’t work.There’s a big problem here to figure out.You go home, Billy, and leave me alone.I’ve got to work at it all by myself.Take that bottle of Three-star along with you—no, sir; not another ounce of booze for the United States consul.I’ll sit here tonight and pull out the think stop.If there’s a soft place on this proposition anywhere I’ll land on it.If there isn’t there’ll be another wreck to the credit of the gorgeous tropics.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基奥走了，觉得自己帮不上什么忙。约翰尼往桌上放了一大把雪茄，然后舒展身子，躺在一张折叠帆布椅上。当第一缕晨曦刺破黑暗，给海港的波浪镀上一层银边，他还坐在那里。不久，他站起身来，吹着小曲儿去洗澡了。</td>
		<td class="en">Keogh left, feeling that he could be of no use.Johnny laid a handful of cigars on a table and stretched himself in a steamer chair.When the sudden daylight broke, silvering the harbor ripples, he was still sitting there.Then he got up, whistling a little tune, and took his bath.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >九点整，他走进又黑又脏的小电报室，在一张白纸上磨蹭了半个小时。接着，他签上自己的大名，付了33美元，发出了这封绞尽脑汁写成的电报：</td>
