		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那些地理学的权威们都说蒙达古战场遗址位于巴斯图利—波尼地区。那里靠近现在的蒙达，在马尔贝拉北面二里格左右。但我一直怀疑他们在这个问题上根本就是言而无据。</td>
		<td class="en">I had always suspected the geographical authorities did not know what they were talking about when they located the battlefield of Munda in the county of the Bastuli-Poeni, close to the modern Monda, some two leagues north of Marbella.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >根据某无名氏所著《西班牙战争》以及奥苏那公爵珍贵藏书中的某些资料，我作出推测：这场值得纪念的战争的遗址应该到蒙蒂利亚附近去找寻。在此战中，恺撒一劳永逸地击败了共和制度的拥护者。</td>
		<td class="en">According to my own surmise, founded on the text of the anonymous author of @the Bellum Hispaniense@, and on certain information culled from the excellent library owned by the Duke of Ossuna, I believed the site of the memorable struggle in which Caesar played double or quits, once and for all, with the champions of the Republic, should be sought in the neighborhood of Montilla.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1830年秋，我恰好在安达卢西亚，于是就做了一次长途旅行，以消除萦绕心头的一些疑惑。我坚信，我即将发表的一篇论文，将会把所有求实的考古学家心中遗留的所有疑惑一扫而光。但是，在我的论文最终解决这个全欧学术界都悬而未决的地理问题之前，我想先讲一个小故事。这个故事对蒙达位于何处这个有趣的问题不会产生任何先入为主的影响。</td>
		<td class="en">Happening to be in Andalusia during the autumn of 1830, I made a somewhat lengthy excursion, with the object of clearing up certain doubts which still oppressed me.A paper which I shall shortly publish will, I trust, remove any hesitation that may still exist in the minds of all honest archaeologists.But before that dissertation of mine finally settles the geographical problem on the solution of which the whole of learned Europe hangs, I desire to relate a little tale.It will do no prejudice to the interesting question of the correct locality of Monda.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在科尔多瓦雇了一个向导，租了两匹马，便开始了我的旅程，除了几件衬衫和恺撒的《出征记》，没带其他任何行李。一天，我在烈日的灼烧下疲惫不堪、口渴难耐地奔走于加切那平原高处，不由得从心底里咒骂着恺撒和庞培的儿子们。突然我眼前一亮，发现离我走的小径颇远处有一小块翠绿的草皮，上面零星地长着芦苇和灯芯草。这预示着附近有泉水。果然，我慢慢走近时发现，原来刚才看起来像草地的地方，其实是一片沼泽。有一条像是从卡布拉山脉两个高峰间一道狭窄的峡谷中流出的溪流在这里流入沼泽，消失不见了。</td>
		<td class="en">I had hired a guide and a couple of horses at Cordova, and had started on my way with no luggage save a few shirts, and @Caesar’s Commentaries@.As I wandered, one day, across the higher lands of the Cachena plain, worn with fatigue, parched with thirst, scorched by a burning sun, cursing Caesar and Pompey’s sons alike, most heartily, my eye lighted, at some distance from the path I was following, on a little stretch of green sward dotted with reeds and rushes.That betokened the neighborhood of some spring, and, indeed, as I drew nearer I perceived that what had looked like sward was a marsh, into which a stream, which seemed to issue from a narrow gorge between two high spurs of the Sierra di Cabra, ran and disappeared.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我相信，如果溯流而上，肯定可以找到更凉爽的溪水，水蛭和青蛙也会少些，或许在岩石间还会有些许阴凉。</td>
		<td class="en">If I rode up that stream, I argued, I was likely to find cooler water, fewer leeches and frogs, and mayhap a little shade among the rocks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一进峡谷口，我的马就嘶鸣起来，另一匹马也随即应和，可我却看不见那匹马的踪影。前行不足百步，峡谷豁然开朗，一处天然的竞技场呈现在我眼前，四周危岩耸立，将其完全遮蔽起来。对一个旅行者来说，简直无法想象还有比这更惬意的歇脚地了。险峻的岩石脚下，溪流冒着水泡奔涌而出，落入一个水潭，潭底铺着一层雪白的沙子。五六株茂盛的常青橡树长在水潭边，在这里得以免受狂风的侵袭，还享受着泉水的滋润，以其浓密的枝叶为水潭遮阴。水潭周围有一片茂密、光滑的草地，为游人提供了一张十分舒适的床，方圆十里格之内任何客栈的床铺都没有这么舒服。</td>
		<td class="en">At the mouth of the gorge, my horse neighed, and another horse, invisible to me, neighed back.Before I had advanced a hundred paces, the gorge suddenly widened, and I beheld a sort of natural amphitheatre, thoroughly shaded by the steep cliffs that lay all around it.It was impossible to imagine any more delightful halting place for a traveler.At the foot of the precipitous rocks, the stream bubbled upward and fell into a little basin, lined with sand that was as white as snow.Five or six splendid evergreen oaks, sheltered from the wind, and cooled by the spring, grew beside the pool, and shaded it with their thick foliage.And round about it a close and glossy turf offered the wanderer a better bed than he could have found in any hostelry for ten leagues round.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，发现这个绝妙地点的殊荣并不属于我。在我到那里之前，一个男人已经在那里休息了。毫无疑问，他是在睡觉。被马的嘶鸣声吵醒后，他立刻站了起来，并朝他的马走去。而马趁主人睡觉的时间，已经饱餐了一顿周围的青草。这是一个年轻的汉子，中等身高，但长得很壮实，表情傲慢而阴沉。他的肤色原来可能很漂亮，现在却被太阳晒得比头发还黑。他一只手紧抓着马缰绳。而他的另一只手握着一把铜制的大口径短枪。</td>
		<td class="en">The honor of discovering this fair spot did not belong to me.A man was resting there already—sleeping, no doubt—before I reached it.Roused by the neighing of the horses, he had risen to his feet and had moved over to his mount, which had been taking advantage of its master’s slumbers to make a hearty feed on the grass that grew around.He was an active young fellow, of middle height, but powerful in build, and proud and sullen-looking in expression.His complexion, which may once have been fine, had been tanned by the sun till it was darker than his hair.One of his hands grasped his horse’s halter.In the other he held a brass blunderbuss.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >坦白讲，乍一看到那大口径短枪和那人一脸的凶相，我确实被吓了一跳。但是，由于听过那么多关于强盗的故事却从没真正见到过，我已经不相信强盗真的存在了。况且我也见过很多老实巴交的农民全副武装地去赶集，以至于看到陌生人带着武器，也不会怀疑他们居心不良了。“再说，”我暗自思量着，“他拿走我的衬衫和埃尔塞维尔版的《出征记》又有什么用呢？”于是，我冲着这位拿枪的汉子友好地点了点头，并微笑着问我是不是打扰到他睡觉了。他没有回答，只是从头到脚地打量我。随后，他似乎对审视结果感到满意，便又同样仔细地打量起我刚刚赶上来的向导。只见向导脸色变得煞白，明显惊慌地收住了脚步。“遇到坏人了！”我心里想道。但是，为了谨慎起见，我当即决定不露出任何不安的迹象。于是我从马上下来。我告诉向导卸下马鞍。然后我跪在泉水边，把脑袋和双手都埋进清凉的泉水里，接着大喝一通。我肚皮贴地平趴着，活像基甸的士兵（注：“基甸”为圣经英雄，通过让士兵去溪边喝水来挑选亲兵，凡是趴着喝水的都淘汰去）。</td>
		<td class="en">At the first blush, I confess, the blunderbuss, and the savage looks of the man who bore it, somewhat took me aback.But I had heard so much about robbers, that, never seeing any, I had ceased to believe in their existence.And further, I had seen so many honest farmers arm themselves to the teeth before they went out to market, that the sight of firearms gave me no warrant for doubting the character of any stranger.“And then,” quoth I to myself, “what could he do with my shirts and my Elzevir edition of @Caesar’s Commentaries@?”So I bestowed a friendly nod on the man with the blunderbuss, and inquired, with a smile, whether I had disturbed his nap.Without any answer, he looked me over from head to foot.Then, as if the scrutiny had satisfied him, he looked as closely at my guide, who was just coming up.I saw the guide turn pale, and pull up with an air of evident alarm.“An unlucky meeting!” thought I to myself.But prudence instantly counseled me not to let any symptom of anxiety escape me.So I dismounted.I told the guide to take off the horses’ bridles, and kneeling down beside the spring, I laved my head and hands and then drank a long draught, lying flat on my belly, like Gideon’s soldiers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同时，我留神观察着陌生人和向导。后者走上前来时似乎很不情愿。而前者看起来对我们没有任何恶意。因为他已经放开了马，原来平端着的大口径短枪的枪口现在指向了地面。</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile, I watched the stranger, and my own guide.This last seemed to come forward unwillingly.But the other did not appear to have any evil designs upon us.For he had turned his horse loose, and the blunderbuss, which he had been holding horizontally, was now dropped earthward.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我觉得没有必要因为人家不重视我而生气，便躺在草地上，身体舒展开，很随便地问这个持枪的汉子有没有带点火物。同时我掏出了我的雪茄烟盒。这个陌生人虽然还是不说话，却掏出打火石，当即就为我点火。尽管还拿着武器，他却坐到了我对面，显然变得和气多了。点着烟后，我从剩下的烟里选了支最好的，问他抽不抽烟。</td>
		<td class="en">Not thinking it necessary to take offence at the scant attention paid me, I stretched myself full length upon the grass, and calmly asked the owner of the blunderbuss whether he had a light about him.At the same time I pulled out my cigar-case.The stranger, still without opening his lips, took out his flint, and lost no time in getting me a light.He was evidently growing tamer, for he sat down opposite to me, though he still grasped his weapon.When I had lighted my cigar, I chose out the best I had left, and asked him whether he smoked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“抽的，先生。”他回答道。这是我听他说的第一句话，我注意到他“ｓ”这个音发的不像安达卢西亚口音。由此我推断，他和我一样也是个旅行者，只不过并不像我一样精通考古罢了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, senor,” he replied.These were the first words I had heard him speak, and I noticed that he did not pronounce the letter s in the Andalusian fashion, whence I concluded he was a traveler, like myself, though, maybe, somewhat less of an archaeologist.(1)</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您会发现这支非常不错。”我边说边递给他一支地道的哈瓦那雪茄。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ll find this a fairly good one,” said I, holding out a real Havana regalia.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他微微地点了点头，用我的烟头点着烟，又冲我点了下头表示谢意，然后非常享受地抽了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">He bowed his head slightly, lighted his cigar at mine, thanked me with another nod, and began to smoke with a most lively appearance of enjoyment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊！”他长叹一声，同时从耳朵和鼻孔里慢慢地喷出第一口烟。“我都好久没抽烟了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah!” he exclaimed, as he blew his first puff of smoke slowly out of his ears and nostrils.“What a time it is since I’ve had a smoke!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在西班牙，一个人递一只雪茄过去，如果对方接受了，双方就建立起了一种友好关系，类似于在东欧国家人们通过共同分享面包和盐来结下情谊。出乎我意料的是这个人竟十分健谈。但是，虽然他自称是蒙蒂利亚人，对当地却似乎并不熟悉。他不知道我们现在歇脚的这个迷人的山谷叫什么名字，也说不出邻近任何一个村庄的名字，而当我问他是否注意到附近有任何残垣断壁、宽边大瓦，或是石头雕刻时，他承认自己从没留意过这些东西。不过，谈起马来他却是个行家。他指出我的马有种种不足——这并非难事——接着他向我谈起他的马的血统，说它来自著名的科尔多瓦马场。这确实是匹好马，据它的主人说，它非常健壮，极能吃苦耐劳，曾一日跑过一百五十多里格，全程都在飞奔或疾驰。故事正讲到兴头上，陌生汉子突然停住了，似乎为自己说得太多而感到震惊和懊悔。“实际上我正急着往科尔多瓦赶。”他有些尴尬地接着说道，“我要为一桩官司去求法官们。”他一边说着，一边看着我的向导安东尼奥，后者已经垂下眼皮。</td>
		<td class="en">In Spain the giving and accepting of a cigar establishes bonds of hospitality similar to those founded in Eastern countries on the partaking of bread and salt.My friend turned out more talkative than I had hoped.However, though he claimed to belong to the partido of Montilla, he seemed very ill-informed about the country.He did not know the name of the delightful valley in which we were sitting, he could not tell me the names of any of the neighboring villages, and when I inquired whether he had not noticed any broken-down walls, broad-rimmed tiles, or carved stones in the vicinity, he confessed he had never paid any heed to such matters.On the other hand, he showed himself an expert in horseflesh, found fault with my mount—not a difficult affair—and gave me a pedigree of his own, which had come from the famous stud at Cordova.It was a splendid creature, indeed, so tough, according to its owner’s claim, that it had once covered thirty leagues in one day, either at the gallop or at full trot the whole time.In the midst of his story the stranger pulled up short, as if startled and sorry he had said so much.“The fact is I was in a great hurry to get to Cordova,” he went on, somewhat embarrassed.“I had to petition the judges about a lawsuit.”As he spoke, he looked at my guide Antonio, who had dropped his eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >清凉的泉水和凉爽的树阴令我心旷神怡，我不由得想起蒙蒂利亚的朋友们曾往向导的旅行袋里塞了几段美味的火腿。我吩咐向导把火腿拿出来，并邀请这个陌生人和我们一起享用这顿临时午餐。如果说他很久没抽烟了，那么他的吃相着实让我觉得他至少两天两夜没吃东西了。他的吃相就像一只饿狼。我暗自想道，这个可怜的人能遇见我真是太幸运了。可是，我的向导却吃得很少，也没怎么喝，还一声不吭。然而在我们之前的旅程中他已经证明了自己是个无敌的话匣子。在这个陌生人面前，他看起来很不自在，他们中间似乎存在着一种互不信任的感觉，为什么会这样我也弄不清楚。</td>
		<td class="en">The spring and the cool shade were so delightful that I bethought me of certain slices of an excellent ham, which my friends at Montilla had packed into my guide’s wallet.I bade him produce them, and invited the stranger to share our impromptu lunch.If he had not smoked for a long time, he certainly struck me as having fasted for eight-and-forty hours at the very least.He ate like a starving wolf, and I thought to myself that my appearance must really have been quite providential for the poor fellow.Meanwhile my guide ate but little, drank still less, and spoke never a word, although in the earlier part of our journey he had proved himself a most unrivalled chatterer.He seemed ill at ease in the presence of our guest, and a sort of mutual distrust, the cause of which I could not exactly fathom, seemed to be between them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >连最后一点面包屑和火腿渣也被吃得一干二净。我们各自又抽了支雪茄；我告诉向导牵马备鞍，正当我要向这位新朋友告别时，他却问我准备在哪里过夜。</td>
		<td class="en">The last crumbs of bread and scraps of ham had disappeared.We had each smoked our second cigar; I told the guide to bridle the horses, and was just about to take leave of my new friend, when he inquired where I was going to spend the night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我还没来得及注意到向导的暗示，就已经脱口说出自己要去居尔沃客店。</td>
		<td class="en">Before I had time to notice a sign my guide was making to me I had replied that I was going to the Venta del Cuervo.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“先生，您这样的绅士怎么能住那样一个鬼地方！我自己也要去那里，如果您允许我奉陪的话，我们一起走吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s a bad lodging for a gentleman like you, sir!I’m bound there myself, and if you’ll allow me to ride with you, we’ll go together.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好呀！”我说着骑上了马。</td>
		<td class="en">“With pleasure!” I replied, mounting my horse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >向导一边托住我的马镫，又冲我使了个眼色。我耸了耸肩作为回答，仿佛安慰他说我一点也不担心。接着我们上路了。</td>
		<td class="en">The guide, who was holding my stirrup, looked at me meaningly again.I answered by shrugging my shoulders, as though to assure him I was perfectly easy in my mind, and we started on our way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >安东尼奥神秘的暗示，显而易见的焦虑，以及陌生人无意中说出的一些话，尤其是他一口气骑了三十里格以及为此给出的牵强解释，已经让我对这个同伴的身份心里有数了。无疑，我正与一个走私贩或强盗同行。那又有什么关系呢？凭我对西班牙人性格的了解，我确信一个与我一起吃过饭吸过烟的人没什么好怕的。遇到坏人时有他在身边还能保护我一下。此外，我非常高兴能了解到强盗到底是什么样的。这类人可不是每天都能碰到的。而且，与一个危险人物在近距离接触有某种魅力，尤其是感觉这个人又很温驯的时候。</td>
		<td class="en">Antonio’s mysterious signals, his evident anxiety, a few words dropped by the stranger, above all, his ride of thirty leagues, and the far from plausible explanation he had given us of it, had already enabled me to form an opinion as to the identity of my fellow-traveler.I had no doubt at all I was in the company of a smuggler, and possibly of a brigand.What cared I?I knew enough of the Spanish character to be very certain I had nothing to fear from a man who had eaten and smoked with me.His very presence would protect me in case of any undesirable meeting.And besides, I was very glad to know what a brigand was really like.One doesn’t come across such gentry every day.And there is a certain charm about finding one’s self in close proximity to a dangerous being, especially when one feels the being in question to be gentle and tame.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我期望这个陌生人能逐渐向我吐露一些实情，所以，尽管向导一个劲地冲我眨眼递眼色，我还是把谈话的话题引到了强盗上面去。自不必说，我说起他们时满怀敬意。当时，在安达卢西亚有一个有名的强盗叫何塞-玛丽亚，他的壮举人尽皆知。“难道与我同行的竟是何塞-玛丽亚？”我暗自思量。我讲了自己知道的关于这位英雄的所有故事，当然全是为他歌功颂德的，而且表达了我对他的慷慨大方和英勇无畏的强烈仰慕。</td>
		<td class="en">I was hoping the stranger might gradually fall into a confidential mood, and in spite of my guide’s winks, I turned the conversation to the subject of highwaymen.I need scarcely say that I spoke of them with great respect.At that time there was a famous brigand in Andalusia, of the name of Jose-Maria, whose exploits were on every lip.“Supposing I should be riding along with Jose-Maria!” said I to myself.I told all the stories I knew about the hero—they were all to his credit, indeed, and loudly expressed my admiration of his generosity and his valor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“何塞-玛丽亚不过是个恶棍。”陌生人冷冷地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Jose-Maria is nothing but a blackguard,” said the stranger gravely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他这是在公正地评价自己呢，还是过分谦虚？”我思索道，因为通过对这个旅伴的细致观察，我已经把他与何塞·玛丽亚对上号了。我曾在安达卢西亚多个小镇的城门上贴的告示中读到过对何塞·玛丽亚长相的描述。“是的，一定是他——金黄头发、蓝眼睛、大嘴巴、一口好牙、一双小手、优质衬衫、带银纽扣的丝绒短上衣、白皮绑腿、一匹枣红色马。毫无疑问，就是他！但是既然他不愿公开身份，还是尊重他的意愿吧！”我们到了客店。客店的状况正如他向我描述的那样。换句话说，这是我见过的最寒酸的一家客栈了。一间大屋既是厨房，又是餐厅，还是卧室。屋子中间的一块平石板上生着火，滚滚浓烟从屋顶的一个窟窿挤出去，更确切地说，是在离地几英尺高的地方形成了烟云。五六张骡子皮靠着墙铺散在地板上。这就是旅客的床了。在离房子，或者不如说离我刚才描述的那间唯一的房间二十步远的地方，有一个当马厩用的草棚。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is he just to himself, or is this an excess of modesty?” I queried, mentally, for by dint of scrutinizing my companion, I had ended by reconciling his appearance with the description of Jose-Maria which I read posted up on the gates of various Andalusian towns.“Yes, this must be he—fair hair, blue eyes, large mouth, good teeth, small hands, fine shirt, a velvet jacket with silver buttons on it, white leather gaiters, and a bay horse.Not a doubt about it.But his incognito shall be respected!”We reached the venta.It was just what he had described to me.In other words, the most wretched hole of its kind I had as yet beheld.One large apartment served as kitchen, dining-room, and sleeping chamber.A fire was burning on a flat stone in the middle of the room, and the smoke escaped through a hole in the roof, or rather hung in a cloud some feet above the soil.Along the walls five or six mule rugs were spread on the floor.These were the travelers’ beds.Twenty paces from the house, or rather from the solitary apartment which I have just described, stood a sort of shed that served for a stable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这个可爱的寓所里，仅有的居住者是一个老太婆和一个十或十二岁的小女孩。这两人都浑身炭黑、衣衫褴褛。“这就是古代蒙达—巴蒂加居民的全部遗产了。”我心想，“啊，恺撒！啊，塞克斯图斯·庞贝乌斯，如果你们重回这片土地，该会吃惊成什么样子！”</td>
		<td class="en">The only inhabitants of this delightful dwelling visible at the moment, at all events, were an old woman, and a little girl of ten or twelve years old, both of them as black as soot, and dressed in loathsome rags.“Here’s the sole remnant of the ancient populations of Munda Boetica,” said I to myself.“O Caesar!O Sextus Pompeius, if you were to revisit this earth how astounded you would be!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一看到我的旅伴，老太婆不由得惊呼起来。“啊！唐何塞先生！”她叫道。</td>
		<td class="en">When the old woman saw my travelling companion an exclamation of surprise escaped her.“Ah! Senor Don Jose!” she cried. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >唐何塞皱起眉头，威严地扬了扬手，老太婆立刻闭上了嘴。</td>
		<td class="en">Don Jose frowned and lifted his hand with a gesture of authority that forthwith silenced the old dame.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我转向向导，用只有我们才懂的手势告诉他我很清楚今晚要和谁一起过夜。晚餐比我预想的要丰盛得多。食物放在一个仅一英尺高的小桌上。首先上的是一盆红烧老公鸡块烩米饭，里面放了很多辣椒，接着是过油胡椒，最后是“西班牙冷汤”——一种用胡椒制成的沙拉。这三道辣味十足的菜迫使我们不断地从装满蒙蒂利亚酒的山羊皮囊里倒酒喝，里面的酒实在美味极了。</td>
		<td class="en">I turned to my guide and gave him to understand, by a sign that no one else perceived, that I knew all about the man in whose company I was about to spend the night.Our supper was better than I expected.On a little table, only a foot high, we were served with an old rooster, fricasseed with rice and numerous peppers, then more peppers in oil, and finally a gaspacho—a sort of salad made of peppers.These three highly spiced dishes involved our frequent recourse to a goatskin filled with Montella wine, which struck us as being delicious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吃完饭后，我看到墙上挂着一个曼陀林——在西班牙的每个角落都会看到的一种乐器。我问一直在侍候我们的小女孩会不会弹。</td>
		<td class="en">After our meal was over, I caught sight of a mandolin hanging up against the wall—in Spain you see mandolins in every corner—and I asked the little girl, who had been waiting on us, if she knew how to play it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不会，”她答道，“但是唐何塞弹得可好了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” she replied.“But Don Jose does play well!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请您行行好，为我随便唱一曲吧。”我对他说，“我非常喜爱你们的民族音乐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do me the kindness to sing me something,” I said to him, “I’m passionately fond of your national music.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不能拒绝为您这样一位真正的绅士做点事，您给了我那么名贵的雪茄。”唐何塞高兴地说道。他让那女孩把曼陀林递过来，自弹自唱起来。他的声音虽然粗犷，却十分悦耳，曲调古怪而悲凉。至于歌词，我一点也听不懂。</td>
		<td class="en">“I can’t refuse to do anything for such a charming gentleman, who gives me such excellent cigars,” responded Don Jose gaily, and having made the child give him the mandolin, he sang to his own accompaniment.His voice, though rough, was pleasing, the air he sang was strange and sad.As to the words, I could not understand a single one of them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果我没猜错的话，”我说，“您刚才唱的不是西班牙歌曲。倒像是我在特权省份（指阿尔瓦省，比斯开省，吉普斯夸省，以及纳瓦拉省的一部分，这些省都享受特殊待遇）听过的‘索尔西科’，歌词应该是巴斯克语吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“If I am not mistaken,” said I, “that’s not a Spanish air you have just been singing.It’s like the zorzicos I’ve heard in the Provinces, and the words must be in the Basque language.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这些地方，人们说巴斯克语。</td>
		<td class="en">The Basque language is spoken in these countries.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的。”唐何塞神情沮丧地答道。他把曼陀林放在地上，开始凝视快要熄灭的火堆，表情特别忧伤。火光照在他的脸上，立刻映现出他凶悍而高贵的脸庞，让我想起了弥尔顿笔下的撒旦。或许，同撒旦一样，我的旅伴也在思念其失去的家园，思考因罪行而酿成的流放。我试着想恢复谈话，但他还是沉浸在悲伤中，不做任何回应。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” said Don Jose, with a gloomy look.He laid the mandolin down on the ground, and began staring with a peculiarly sad expression at the dying fire.His face, at once fierce and noble-looking, reminded me, as the firelight fell on it, of Milton’s Satan.Like him, perchance, my comrade was musing over the home he had forfeited, the exile he had earned, by some misdeed.I tried to revive the conversation, but so absorbed was he in melancholy thought, that he gave me no answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老太婆已经去房间的一个角落歇息了，前面有一张挂在绳子上的破毯子挡着。小女孩也跟着她进了这个女性专用的安歇处。向导站起来，建议我跟他一起去马厩。但正是这句话把唐何塞惊醒了，厉声问向导要去哪里。</td>
		<td class="en">The old woman had already gone to rest in a corner of the room, behind a ragged rug hung on a rope.The little girl had followed her into this retreat, sacred to the fair sex.Then my guide rose, and suggested that I should go with him to the stable.But at the word Don Jose, waking, as it were, with a start, inquired sharply whither he was going.</td></tr>

Over the court is stretched a piece of tent cloth, which is watered during the day and removed at night. The street door is almost always left open, and the passage leading to the court (zaguan) is closed by an iron lattice of very elegant workmanship.(12) Manana sera otro dia.—A Spanish proverb.(13) Chuquel sos pirela, cocal terela. “The dog that runs finds a bone.”—Gipsy proverb.(14) Sugared yolks of eggs.(15) A sort of nougat.(16) This king, Don Pedro, whom we call “the Cruel,” and whom Queen Isabella, the Catholic, never called anything but “the Avenger,” was fond of walking about the streets of Seville at night in search of adventures, like the Caliph Haroun al Raschid. One night, in a lonely street, he quarrelled with a man who was singing a serenade. There was a fight, and the king killed the amorous caballero. At the clashing of their swords, an old woman put her head out of the window and lighted up the scene with a tiny lamp (candilejo) which she held in her hand. My readers must be informed that King Don Pedro, though nimble and muscular, suffered from one strange fault in his physical conformation. Whenever he walked his knees cracked loudly. By this cracking the old woman easily recognized him. The next day the veintiquatro in charge came to make his report to the king. “Sir, a duel was fought last night in such a street—one of the combatants is dead.” “Have you found the murderer?” “Yes, sir.” “Why has he not been punished already?”“Sir, I await your orders!”“Carry out the law.” Now the king had just published a decree that every duelist was to have his head cut off, and that head was to be set up on the scene of the fight. The@veintiquatro@ got out of the difficulty like a clever man. He had the head sawed off a statue of the king, and set that up in a niche in the middle of the street in which the murder had taken place. The king and all the Sevillians thought this a very good joke. The street took its name from the lamp held by the old woman, the only witness of the incident. The above is the popular tradition. Zuniga tells the story somewhat differently. However that may be, a street called@Calle del Candilejo@still exists in Seville, and in that street there is a bust which is said to be a portrait of Don Pedro. This bust, unfortunately, is a modern production. During the seventeenth century the old one had become very much defaced, and the municipality had it replaced by that now to be seen.(17) Rom, husband. Romi, wife.(18) Calo, feminine calli, plural cales. Literally “black,” the name the gypsies apply to themselves in their own language.(19) Spanish dragoons wear a yellow uniform.(20) Me dicas vriarda de jorpoy, bus ne sino braco.—A gipsy proverb.(21) The Saint, the Holy Virgin.(22) The gallows, which is the widow of the last man hanged upon it.(23) Flamenco de Roma, a slang term for the gypsies. Roma does not stand for the Eternal City, but for the nation of the romi, or the married folk—a name applied by the gypsies to themselves. The first gypsies seen in Spain probably came from the Low Countries, hence their name of Flemings.(24) A bulbous root, out of which rather a pleasant beverage is manufactured.(25) The ordinary food of a Spanish soldier.(26) Ustilar a pastesas, to steal cleverly, to purloin without violence.(27) A sort of volunteer corps.(28) One-eyed man.(29) “The idiots, they take me for a smart lady!”(30) Name applied by the Spanish populace to the British soldiers, on account of the colour of their uniform.(31) To the galleys, or else to all the devils in hell.(32) My “lover,” or rather my “fancy.”(33) Navarro fino.(34) Or esorjle de or marsichisle, sin chisnar lachinguel. “The promise of a dwarf is that he will spit a long way.”—A gipsy proverb.(35) La divisa. A knot of ribbon, the colour of which indicates the pasturage from which each bull comes. This knot of ribbon is fastened into the bull’s hide with a sort of hook, and it is considered the very height of gallantry to snatch it off the living beast and present it to a woman.(36) Maria Padella was accused of having bewitched Don Pedro. According to one popular tradition she presented Queen Blanche of Bourbon with a golden girdle which, in the eyes of the bewitched king, took on the appearance of a living snake. Hence the repugnance he always showed toward the unhappy princess.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波西米亚人，又称吉达诺人、吉普赛人，或齐热内尔人，是一个流浪民族，散布在整个欧洲。目前，西班牙是他们聚集人数最多的国家之一。他们大多数居住在，更确切地说是流浪在西班牙南部和东部省份，如安达卢西亚，艾斯特拉马都拉及穆尔西亚王国。另外，还有大量的吉普赛人聚集在加泰罗尼亚。这一地区的吉普赛人常常越境到法国去，在我们南部的所有集市上都能看到他们。吉普赛男人们通常以喂马、医马、剪骡毛为业，另外有些也修补锅和铜器，更不必说走私及其他非法勾当了。女人们靠算命、乞讨、卖药为生，卖的药中有些是有毒的，有些则是无害的。吉普赛人的体貌特征辨别起来相对容易，但要描述出来却有些难。只要你见过一个吉普赛人，你就能在一千个人中认出其中仅有的一个吉普赛人。他们与当地居民的不同尤其表现在其外貌和表情上。他们皮肤黝黑，颜色总会比其居住地的当地民族深一些。所以他们常自称为“加莱人”（黑人）。他们的眼睛明显有些斜，但却大而乌黑，而且有长而浓密的睫毛遮护。他们的目光唯有野兽可以比拟。其中勇敢与怯懦并存。从这一角度看，他们的眼神正显示了其民族性格：狡猾、勇敢，但又像巴汝奇（注：讽刺小说《巨人传》中人物庞大固埃）那样“天生害怕挨打”。大部分吉普赛人身体魁梧、修长而敏捷。我从没见过任何一个吉普赛胖子。在德国，吉普赛女人通常很漂亮；但是西班牙的却很少有漂亮的。青春年少时，她们的丑或许也还有一些迷人之处，而一旦做了母亲，她们就完全变得令人恶心了。吉普赛人无论男女，都脏得令人难以置信。如果没有见过一个吉普赛中年妇女的头发，就不可能对其肮脏程度形成任何概念。即使把她的头发想象成最粗糙、最油腻、最肮脏的头发也不为过。在安达卢西亚的一些大城镇里，姿色稍微出众的吉普赛姑娘们更加注意其外表。她们靠出去跳舞挣钱，跳的舞蹈与狂欢节公共舞会上禁跳的舞蹈极为相似。英国传教士博罗先生，代表圣经协会向西班牙的吉普赛人传教。他写了两部关于西班牙吉普赛人的作品，读来非常有趣。他宣称，任何一个吉普赛女子都不可能会委身于外族男子。我觉得，他对她们忠贞程度的赞扬太过夸张了。首先，她们中的大多数都是奥维德（注：罗马诗人，诗歌集《变形记》的作者）笔下描述的丑婆娘：“没人要的处女。”而那些漂亮的吉普赛姑娘，就像所有西班牙妇女一样，选择爱人时非常挑剔。双方必须两情相悦、心意相称。为了证明她们的忠贞，博罗先生举了一个例子。其实倒证明了他自己的一大特点，尤其证明了他的天真幼稚。他说他认识的一个浪荡子弟给了一个漂亮的吉普赛女子好几盎司黄金，结果却一无所获。我对一个安达卢西亚人转述了这段轶闻。他断言，如果这个浪荡子弟给那个吉普赛姑娘的是两三皮阿斯特，成功的机会会大得多。给一个吉普赛人几盎司黄金，就像许诺给一个客栈的乡下姑娘几百万，都不是什么有说服力的好办法。虽然如此，可以肯定的是，吉普赛女子对其丈夫特别地忠诚。在丈夫需要的时候，不管要冒多大险，吃多少苦，她都义无反顾。“罗姆”是吉普赛人使用的称呼之一，意思是“已婚夫妇”。在我看来，这是他们民族尊重婚姻的一个证据。总体来说，我们可以断言，他们的主要美德是爱族精神。退一万步讲，他们在与自己族人的各种交往中遵循着忠诚原则，并且随时准备互相帮助。在所有危及信誉的事件中，他们能为了对方利益彼此保守秘密。确实，像这种精神，在所有超越法律界限的神秘组织中都能看到。</td>
		<td class="en">Spain is one of the countries in which those nomads, scattered all over Europe, and known as Bohemians, Gitanas, Gypsies, Ziegeuner, and so forth, are now to be found in the greatest numbers.Most of these people live, or rather wander hither and thither, in the southern and eastern provinces of Spain, in Andalusia, and Estramadura, in the kingdom of Murcia.There are a great many of them in Catalonia.These last frequently cross over into France and are to be seen at all our southern fairs.The men generally call themselves grooms, horse doctors, mule-clippers; to these trades they add the mending of saucepans and brass utensils, not to mention smuggling and other illicit practices.The women tell fortunes, beg, and sell all sorts of drugs, some of which are innocent, while some are not.The physical characteristics of the Gypsies are more easily distinguished then described, and when you have known one, you should be able to recognize a member of the race among a thousand other men.It is by their physiognomy and expression, especially, that they differ from the other inhabitants of the same country.Their complexion is exceedingly swarthy, always darker than that of the race among whom they live.Hence the name of cale (blacks) which they frequently apply to themselves.(1)Their eyes, set with a decided slant, are large, very black, and shaded by long and heavy lashes.Their glance can only be compared to that of a wild creature.It is full at once of boldness and shyness, and in this respect their eyes are a fair indication of their national character, which is cunning, bold, but with “the natural fear of blows,” like Panurge.Most of the men are strapping fellows, slight and active.I don’t think I ever saw a gipsy who had grown fat.In Germany the gipsy women are often very pretty; but beauty is very uncommon among the Spanish gitanas.When very young, they may pass as being attractive in their ugliness, but once they have reached motherhood, they become absolutely repulsive.The filthiness of both sexes is incredible, and no one who has not seen a gipsy matron’s hair can form any conception of what it is, not even if he conjures up the roughest, the greasiest, and the dustiest heads imaginable.In some of the large Andalusian towns certain of the gipsy girls, somewhat better looking than their fellows, will take more care of their personal appearance.These go out and earn money by performing dances strongly resembling those forbidden at our public balls in carnival time.An English missionary, Mr. Borrow, the author of two very interesting works on the Spanish Gypsies, whom he undertook to convert on behalf of the Bible Society, declares there is no instance of any gitana showing the smallest weakness for a man not belonging to her own race.The praise he bestows upon their chastity strikes me as being exceedingly exaggerated.In the first place, the great majority are in the position of the ugly woman described by Ovid, “Casta quam nemo rogavit.”As for the pretty ones, they are, like all Spanish women, very fastidious in choosing their lovers.Their fancy must be taken, and their favour must be earned.Mr. Borrow quotes, in proof of their virtue, one trait which does honour to his own, and especially to his simplicity: he declares that an immoral man of his acquaintance offered several gold ounces to a pretty gitana, and offered them in vain.An Andalusian, to whom I retailed this anecdote, asserted that the immoral man in question would have been far more successful if he had shown the girl two or three piastres, and that to offer gold ounces to a gipsy was as poor a method of persuasion as to promise a couple of millions to a tavern wench.However that may be, it is certain that the gitana shows the most extraordinary devotion to her husband.There is no danger and no suffering she will not brave, to help him in his need.One of the names which the Gypsies apply to themselves, Rome, or “the married couple,” seems to me a proof of their racial respect for the married state.Speaking generally, it may be asserted that their chief virtue is their patriotism—if we may thus describe the fidelity they observe in all their relations with persons of the same origin as their own, their readiness to help one another, and the inviolable secrecy which they keep for each other’s benefit, in all compromising matters.And indeed something of the same sort may be noticed in all mysterious associations which are beyond the pale of the law.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几个月前，我参观了住在孚日山区的一个吉普赛部落。有一个老太婆，是部落中最年长的成员。我发现，在她的小屋里住了一个患了不治之症的吉普赛男人，此人与这个家庭非亲非故。虽然在医院里得到了很好的照顾，这个人还是离开了医院，只为能死在自己族人身边。在这里，他已经在帐篷里卧床十三个星期了，受到的照顾比这家里的儿子和女婿还好。他睡在由稻草和苔藓做的好床上，被褥还算洁白，而家里的其他十一个人，都睡在三英尺长的木板上。吉普赛人就是这般热情好客。同样是这个老太婆，对待她的客人那么仁慈，却不断地当着病人的面说：“Singo, singo, homte hi mulo."意思是：“很快，很快他就要死了。”毕竟，这些人过着如此悲惨的生活，以至于当面提到死也不会让他们害怕了。</td>
		<td class="en">Some months ago, I paid a visit to a gipsy tribe in the Vosges country.In the hut of an old woman, the oldest member of the tribe, I found a gipsy, in no way related to the family, who was sick of a mortal disease.The man had left a hospital, where he was well cared for, so that he might die among his own people.For thirteen weeks he had been lying in bed in their encampment, and receiving far better treatment than any of the sons and sons-in-law who shared his shelter.He had a good bed made of straw and moss, and sheets that were tolerably white, whereas all the rest of the family, which numbered eleven persons, slept on planks three feet long.So much for their hospitality.This very same woman, humane as was her treatment of her guest said to me constantly before the sick man: “Singo, singo, homte hi mulo.”“Soon, soon he must die!”After all, these people live such miserable lives, that a reference to the approach of death can have no terrors for them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉普赛人性格的一个显著特点是他们对宗教的漠然。倒不是因为他们意志坚定或持怀疑态度。他们从未宣称自己是无神论者。而且事实也的确远非如此。他们居住地区的宗教往往就是他们的宗教；但是当他们改变了定居地时，宗教信仰也随之改变了。他们同样也不受迷信的束缚，而迷信在原始民族的思想中代替了宗教。的确，在一个一贯利用别人的轻信为生的民族中，迷信怎么可能存在下去呢？然而，我却注意到西班牙的吉普赛人在接触尸体时却特别害怕。就算给钱，也很少有吉普赛人愿意抬死人下葬。</td>
		<td class="en">One remarkable feature in the gipsy character is their indifference about religion.Not that they are strong-minded or skeptical.They have never made any profession of atheism.Far from that, indeed, the religion of the country which they inhabit is always theirs; but they change their religion when they change the country of their residence.They are equally free from the superstitions which replace religious feeling in the minds of the vulgar.How, indeed, can superstition exist among a race which, as a rule, makes its livelihood out of the credulity of others?Nevertheless, I have remarked a particular horror of touching a corpse among the Spanish Gypsies.Very few of these could be induced to carry a dead man to his grave, even if they were paid for it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我说过，大部分吉普赛女人靠给人算命为生。在这方面她们很是得心应手。但她们通过卖符咒和春药挣得更多。她们不仅拿蟾蜍的爪子抓住易变的心，还会把天然磁石磨成粉末在冰冷的心中点起爱火，而且在必要时，她们还能用咒语迫使魔鬼来助一臂之力。去年一位西班牙女士给我讲了下面的故事。有一天她正又伤心又忧虑地走在阿尔卡拉街上。一个坐在街上的吉普赛女人冲她叫道：“美丽的夫人，您的爱人背叛了您！”（这是真的。）“您想让我使他回心转意吗？”读者们可以想象，这样的提议被多么欣喜地接受了，一个能猜中你心底秘密的人能激起多么完全的信任！由于不能在马德里最繁华的街道上施巫术，她们约定第二天见面。“没有什么事比把不忠的人带回您脚下更容易了！”这个吉普赛女郎说，“您有没有他送您的手帕、头巾，或披肩？”夫人递给她一块丝绸头巾。“现在用深红色丝线在头巾一角缝上一枚皮阿斯特，在另一角缝半个皮阿斯特，在这里缝一枚比塞塔，那里缝两个雷阿尔银币；然后，在中间必须缝一枚金币，最好是达布隆。”达布隆和其他硬币都按要求缝上了。“现在把头巾给我，午夜一到我就把它带到墓地去。如果你想看一出绝妙的巫术的话，跟我一起去吧。我保证明天你就能见到所爱的男人！”因为我的西班牙朋友太害怕巫术了，不敢跟她一起去，吉普赛女人一个人去了墓地。至于可怜的被抛弃的夫人究竟能否再见她的爱人或是她的头巾，我还是留给读者去猜吧。</td>
		<td class="en">I have said that most gipsy women undertake to tell fortunes.They do this very successfully.But they find a much greater source of profit in the sale of charms and love-philters.Not only do they supply toads’ claws to hold fickle hearts, and powdered loadstone to kindle love in cold ones, but if necessity arises, they can use mighty incantations, which force the devil to lend them his aid.Last year the following story was related to me by a Spanish lady.She was walking one day along the Calle d’Alcala, feeling very sad and anxious.A gipsy woman who was squatting on the pavement called out to her, “My pretty lady, your lover has played you false!”(It was quite true.) “Shall I get him back for you?”My readers will imagine with what joy the proposal was accepted, and how complete was the confidence inspired by a person who could thus guess the inmost secrets of the heart.As it would have been impossible to proceed to perform the operations of magic in the most crowded street in Madrid, a meeting was arranged for the next day.“Nothing will be easier than to bring back the faithless one to your feet!” said the gitana.“Do you happen to have a handkerchief, a scarf, or a mantilla, that he gave you?”A silken scarf was handed her.“Now sew a piastre into one corner of the scarf with crimson silk—sew half a piastre into another corner—sew a peseta here—and a two-real piece there; then, in the middle you must sew a gold coin—a doubloon would be best.”The doubloon and all the other coins were duly sewn in.“Now give me the scarf, and I’ll take it to the Campo Santo when midnight strikes.You come along with me, if you want to see a fine piece of witchcraft.I promise you shall see the man you love to-morrow!”The gipsy departed alone for the Campo Santo, since my Spanish friend was too much afraid of witchcraft to go there with her.I leave my readers to guess whether my poor forsaken lady ever saw her lover, or her scarf, again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉普赛人虽然生活贫困，而且有些惹人厌恶，但在更为无知的粗人中还颇享威信，这让他们很是自豪。在智力上，他们感觉自己是上等民族，而且从心底里蔑视那些欢迎他们的人。“这些外族人太愚蠢了，”孚日山区的一个吉普赛人对我说，“骗他们算不得什么本事。有一天，一个乡下女人在街上喊我，我就到她屋里去了。她的炉子在冒烟，她让我念咒语让炉子别冒烟了。首先我让她给我一大块咸猪肉，然后我用罗马尼语咕哝道：‘你是个蠢货，你生来是个蠢货，到死也是个蠢货！’当我快走出门口时，我用标准的德语对她说：‘让你的炉子不冒烟的最好办法就是别在里面生火！’说完我拔腿就跑。”</td>
		<td class="en">In spite of their poverty and the sort of aversion they inspire, the Gypsies are treated with a certain amount of consideration by the more ignorant folk, and they are very proud of it.They feel themselves to be a superior race as regards intelligence, and they heartily despise the people whose hospitality they enjoy.“These Gentiles are so stupid,” said one of the Vosges Gypsies to me, “that there is no credit in taking them in.The other day a peasant woman called out to me in the street.I went into her house.Her stove smoked and she asked me to give her a charm to cure it.First of all I made her give me a good bit of bacon, and then I began to mumble a few words in Romany.‘You’re a fool,’ I said, ‘you were born a fool, and you’ll die a fool!’When I had got near the door I said to her, in good German, ‘The most certain way of keeping your stove from smoking is not to light any fire in it!’ and then I took to my heels.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉普赛人的历史仍然是个谜。的确，我们知道第一批吉普赛人人数很少，且分布稀疏，大约在十五世纪初期出现在欧洲东部。但没有人能说出他们从哪里来，或为什么来到欧洲。更为离奇的是，没有人知道他们是如何在这么短的时间内，而且在距离遥远的多个地区，以如此惊人的速度繁衍的。吉普赛人自己没有保留下任何有关自己渊源的传统。虽然他们大部分人说埃及是他们的祖国，但那只是因为他们接受了一个关于自己种族的古老传说罢了。</td>
		<td class="en">The history of the Gypsies is still a problem.We know, indeed, that their first bands, which were few and far between, appeared in Eastern Europe towards the beginning of the fifteenth century.But nobody can tell whence they started, or why they came to Europe, and, what is still more extraordinary, no one knows how they multiplied, within a short time, and in so prodigious a fashion, and in several countries, all very remote from each other.The Gypsies themselves have preserved no tradition whatsoever as to their origin, and though most of them do speak of Egypt as their original fatherland, that is only because they have adopted a very ancient fable respecting their race.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >研究过吉普赛语言的大多数东方学者都认为，这个民族的发源地是印度。事实上，吉普赛语的很多词根和语法形式似乎能从衍生自梵文的方言中找到。可以想象，吉普赛人在长期的流浪中采用了很多外来词。在每一种罗姆语方言中，都会有一些希腊词汇。</td>
		<td class="en">Most of the Orientalists who have studied the gipsy language believe that the cradle of the race was in India.It appears, in fact, that many of the roots and grammatical forms of the Romany tongue are to be found in idioms derived from the Sanskrit.As may be imagined, the Gypsies, during their long wanderings, have adopted many foreign words.In every Romany dialect a number of Greek words appear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >今天，吉普赛人的方言数量几乎跟他们民族彼此隔离的部落的数量一样多。各地的吉普赛人讲当地语言比讲自己的方言更为流利，他们很少说方言，只有在陌生人面前为了与自己人交谈方便时才用。德国的吉普赛人与西班牙的吉普赛人已有几个世纪不相往来了，对比两者的方言就能发现大量两者共有的词汇。但是在与当地更为发达的语言的接触中，他们居住的各个地方的原始土语都会明显受到不同程度的影响，因为流浪民族不得不使用当地语言。一边是德语，一边是西班牙语，它们大大改变了吉普赛语的基础，以至于来自德国南部黑森林的吉普赛人无法与他在安达卢西亚的兄弟交谈，虽然只要双方说几句话就足以证明他们的土语同宗同源。我相信他们常用的某些词是每种方言所共有的。在我能考证的每种方言词汇中，“pani”指水，“manro”指面包，“mas”是肉，“lon”是盐。</td>
		<td class="en">At the present day the Gypsies have almost as many dialects as there are separate hordes of their race.Everywhere, they speak the language of the country they inhabit more easily than their own idiom, which they seldom use, except with the object of conversing freely before strangers.A comparison of the dialect of the German Gypsies with that used by the Spanish Gypsies, who have held no communication with each other for several centuries, reveals the existence of a great number of words common to both.But everywhere the original language is notably affected, though in different degrees, by its contact with the more cultivated languages into the use of which the nomads have been forced.German in one case and Spanish in the other have so modified the Romany groundwork that it would not be possible for a gipsy from the Black Forest to converse with one of his Andalusian brothers, although a few sentences on each side would suffice to convince them that each was speaking a dialect of the same language.Certain words in very frequent use are, I believe, common to every dialect.Thus, in every vocabulary which I have been able to consult, pani means water, manro means bread, mas stands for meat, and lon for salt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >数字名词在每种方言中都差不多。在我看来，德国的吉普赛方言比西班牙的纯正得多，因为它保留了很多原始的语法形式，而西班牙的吉普赛人却采用了卡斯蒂利亚语的语法形式。虽然如此，却有许多例外的词语，好像要证明这种语言原来是他们是通用的。德国吉普赛方言的过去式是由命令式加“ium”构成的，命令式一律是动词的词根。在西班牙罗姆语中，动词全部按照卡斯蒂利亚语动词的第一变位形式来变位的。例如“jamar”是“吃”的动词原形，规则变位应该是“jame”——“我吃过了”；“lillar”是“拿”的原形，规则变位应该是“lille”——“我已经拿了”。可是，许多年老的吉普赛人却不这么变位，而是把这两个词变成成“jayon”和“lillon”。其他保留了这种古老形式的动词我就不知道了。</td>
		<td class="en">The nouns of number are almost the same in every case.The German dialect seems to me much purer than the Spanish, for it has preserved numbers of the primitive grammatical forms, whereas the Gitanos have adopted those of the Castilian tongue.Nevertheless, some words are an exception, as though to prove that the language was originally common to all.The preterite of the German dialect is formed by adding ium to the imperative, which is always the root of the verb.In the Spanish Romany the verbs are all conjugated on the model of the first conjugation of the Castilian verbs.From jamar, the infinitive of “to eat,” the regular conjugation should be jame, “I have eaten.”From lillar, “to take,” lille, “I have taken.”Yet, some old Gypsies say, as an exception, jayon and lillon.I am not acquainted with any other verbs which have preserved this ancient form.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >既然我已在这样卖弄我对罗姆语的一知半解，不妨再列举几个法国俚语。我注意到这些俚语都是我们的“小偷”从吉普赛人那里借来的。从《巴黎的秘密》中，求实的人已经学到“chourin”这个词是“一把小刀”的意思。这是纯正的罗姆语——“tchouri”是各种方言共有的词之一。维多克先生管马叫“gres”——这又是个吉普赛词语——“gras”，“gre”，及“gris”。再多加一个词“romanichel”，巴黎俚语中用它来指吉普赛人。这是从“romanetchave”变来的，意思是“吉普赛小伙子”。但是我真正感到自豪的是找到了“frimousse”这个词的词源，意为“脸”、“面”，这个词每个学童都用，至少我小时候是这样。首先请注意，在乌丹于1640年出版的古怪的字典里，就写入了“firlimouse”这个词。现在的罗姆语中，“firla”，或“fila”，是“脸”的意思，“mui”也是这个意思，相当于拉丁语的“os”。一个真正的吉普赛人能立即理解复合词“firlamui”的意思，我相信它符合吉普赛语言的精神本质。</td>
		<td class="en">While I am thus showing off my small acquaintance with the Romany language, I must notice a few words of French slang which our thieves have borrowed from the Gypsies.From Les Mysteres de Paris honest folk have learned that the word chourin means “a knife.”This is pure Romany—tchouri is one of the words which is common to every dialect.Monsieur Vidocq calls a horse gres—this again is a gipsy word—gras, gre, graste, and gris.Add to this the word romanichel, by which the Gypsies are described in Parisian slang.This is a corruption of romane tchave—“gipsy lads.”But a piece of etymology of which I am really proud is that of the word frimousse, “face,” “countenance”—a word which every schoolboy uses, or did use, in my time.Note, in the first place, the Oudin, in his curious dictionary, published in 1640, wrote the word firlimouse.Now in Romany, firla, or fila, stands for “face,” and has the same meaning—it is exactly the os of the Latins.The combination of firlamui was instantly understood by a genuine gipsy, and I believe it to be true to the spirit of the gipsy language.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了让《卡门》的读者对我的吉普赛语研究有个好印象，无疑我已经说得足够多了。下面的谚语，用在这里非常合适，我想以它作为结语。那就是：“只要不开口，苍蝇就飞不进口。”</td>
		<td class="en">I have surely said enough to give the readers of Carmen a favorable idea of my Romany studies.I will conclude with the following proverb, which comes in very appropriately: En retudi panda nasti abela macha.“Between closed lips no fly can pass.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（１）让我印象深刻的是德国的吉普赛人虽然完全理解“加莱”这个词的意思，却不介意被这么称呼。他们在自己人中一直使用“romanetchave”这个称呼。</td>
		<td class="en">(1) It has struck me that the German Gypsies, though they thoroughly understand the word cale, do not care to be called by that name.Among themselves they always use the designation Romanetchave.</td></tr>
