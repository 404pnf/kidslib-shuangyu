		<td class="en">Women are Scheherazades by birth, predilection, instinct, and arrangement of the vocal cords.The thousand and one stories are being told every day by hundreds of thousands of viziers’ daughters to their respective sultans.But the bowstring will get some of ’em yet if they don’t watch out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我就听过这么一则女富翁的故事。确切地说，这不算是《一千零一夜》里的故事，因为里面还出现了灰姑娘，而这个人物却在另一个时代另一个国度挥动着她的抹布。所以，要是你不介意把这两个时代揉在一起（毕竟这样一来故事听上去多了一丝东方韵味），我们不妨把故事讲下去。</td>
		<td class="en">I heard a story, though, of one lady Caliph.It isn’t precisely an Arabian Nights story, because it brings in Cinderella, who flourished her dishrag in another epoch and country.So, if you don’t mind the mixed dates (which seem to give it an Eastern flavour, after all), we’ll get along.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在纽约，有一家很古老很古老的旅馆。你们应该在杂志上看到过它的木版画。它建成的时侯——让我想想——那时，第十四大道以北的地带还是一片荒凉，只有一条通往波士顿和哈默斯坦事务所的古老的印第安小径。这家古老的旅馆很快就要被拆毁了。当坚固的墙壁轰然倒塌，砖块随溜槽落下发出轰然巨响时，成群的市民会聚集在最近的街角，为这一古老珍贵的地标建筑的毁灭而哭泣。新巴格达人的市民自豪感是最强的；而在这些抗议破坏地标建筑的人们当中，流泪最多、喊声最高的将会是这么一个人（他出生在特雷霍特），他对于这古老旅馆的甜蜜记忆仅限于一八七三年，那年他曾被人从免费午餐的柜台前踢出去。</td>
		<td class="en">In New York there is an old, old hotel.You have seen woodcuts of it in the magazines.It was built—let’s see—at a time when there was nothing above Fourteenth Street except the old Indian trail to Boston and Hammerstein’s office.Soon the old hostelry will be torn down.And, as the stout walls are riven apart and the bricks go roaring down the chutes, crowds of citizens will gather at the nearest corners and weep over the destruction of a dear old landmark.Civic pride is strongest in New Bagdad; and the wettest weeper and the loudest howler against the iconoclasts will be the man (originally from Terre Haute) whose fond memories of the old hotel are limited to his having been kicked out from its free-lunch counter in 1873.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >玛吉·布朗夫人总在这家旅馆驻留。布朗夫人六十岁上下，骨瘦如柴，穿着褪尽了色的黑衣服，挎着一个手提包，这包的皮子显然来自当年被亚当命名为短吻鳄的那种动物。她总是住在旅馆顶层一个客卧两用的小房间，每天的租金为两美元。她住在那儿时，每天都有很多男人赶来见她。他们都是脸型瘦削，表情急切，仿佛只能腾出几秒钟时间。据说玛吉·布朗是世界第三大女富翁；而这些满面焦虑的绅士正是城里最富有的经纪人和生意人，想从这位拎着陈旧手提包的肮脏老妇人手里得到区区几百万的贷款。</td>
		<td class="en">At this hotel always stopped Mrs. Maggie Brown.Mrs. Brown was a bony woman of sixty, dressed in the rustiest black, and carrying a handbag made, apparently, from the hide of the original animal that Adam decided to call an alligator.She always occupied a small parlour and bedroom at the top of the hotel at a rental of two dollars per day.And always, while she was there, each day came hurrying to see her many men, sharp-faced, anxious-looking, with only seconds to spare.For Maggie Brown was said to be the third richest woman in the world; and these solicitous gentlemen were only the city’s wealthiest brokers and business men seeking trifling loans of half a dozen millions or so from the dingy old lady with the prehistoric handbag.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艾达·贝茨小姐是阿克罗波利斯旅馆（呀！我怎么把旅馆的名字说出来了！）的速记员兼打字员。她美得就像古希腊文学作品里的人物。她的美貌毫无瑕疵。有位老前辈这样赞美一位小姐：“爱过她，就相当于接受过一次人文教育。”真的，即使只是瞧一瞧贝茨小姐的黑发和整洁的白色衬衫式连衣裙，就等于在这个国家的任何一所函授学校修了一门完整的课程。有时她会为我打打字，而且，因为不肯提前收钱，她似乎渐渐把我当成了朋友和保护人。她天生一副好脾气，总是和蔼可亲；只要她在场，即使是铅白推销员或毛皮进口商也不敢举止不端。阿克罗波利斯的全体员工，从住在维也纳的老板，到卧床十六年的搬运工头头，都愿意随时挺身而出保护她。</td>
		<td class="en">The stenographer and typewriter of the Acropolis Hotel (there! I’ve let the name of it out!) was Miss Ida Bates.She was a hold-over from the Greek classics.There wasn’t a flaw in her looks.Some old-timer paying his regards to a lady said: “To have loved her was a liberal education.”Well, even to have looked over the black hair and neat white shirtwaist of Miss Bates was equal to a full course in any correspondence school in the country.She sometimes did a little typewriting for me, and, as she refused to take the money in advance, she came to look upon me as something of a friend and protégé.She had unfailing kindliness and a good nature; and not even a white-lead drummer or a fur importer had ever dared to cross the dead line of good behaviour in her presence.The entire force of the Acropolis, from the owner, who lived in Vienna, down to the head porter, who had been bedridden for sixteen years, would have sprung to her defence in a moment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一天，我走过贝茨小姐那小小的、神圣的雷明顿打字机，看到她的位置上有一个长着黑发的东西——准是一个人——不停地用她的食指重重地敲击按键。我走开了，心里还想着世事真是无常啊。第二天我就去度假了，在外游玩了两周。我回来时，信步走过阿克罗波利斯的大堂，看到贝茨小姐正给她的打字机罩上罩子。她还是那样高贵优雅，和蔼可亲，完美无瑕，她的脸蛋微微泛红，似乎忆起了往昔的美好时光。已经到停止营业的时间了；但她要我进去，在口授用的椅子上小坐几分钟。贝茨小姐解释了为什么她离开了阿克罗波利斯旅馆，后来又回来了；下面所写的差不多都是她的原话：</td>
		<td class="en">One day I walked past Miss Bates’s little sanctum Remingtorium, and saw in her place a black-haired unit—unmistakably a person—pounding with each of her forefingers upon the keys.Musing on the mutability of temporal affairs, I passed on.The next day I went on a two weeks’ vacation.Returning, I strolled through the lobby of the Acropolis, and saw, with a little warm glow of auld lang syne, Miss Bates, as Grecian and kind and flawless as ever, just putting the cover on her machine.The hour for closing had come; but she asked me in to sit for a few minutes in the dictation chair.Miss Bates explained her absence from and return to the Acropolis Hotel in words identical with or similar to these following:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Well, Man, how are the stories coming?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还是那样吧，”我说，“差不多寄出去多少，退回来多少。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pretty regularly,” said I. “About equal to their going.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我很抱歉，”她说，“对于一篇小说来说，打印的好坏十分关键。你想我了，对吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m sorry,” said she.“Good typewriting is the main thing in a story.You’ve missed me, haven’t you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有人，”我说，“在我认识的人当中，没有人能像你这样，把腰带扣系得熨熨帖帖，把分号的间距打得恰到好处，把客人照顾得心满意足，把发夹别得漂漂亮亮。但是你也离开了。前几天，我在你的位置上看到一包薄荷味助消化剂。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No one,” said I, “whom I have ever known knows as well as you do how to space properly belt buckles, semi-colons, hotel guests, and hairpins.But you’ve been away, too.I saw a package of peppermint-pepsin in your place the other day.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我正打算把一切都告诉你呢，”贝茨小姐说，“要是你没打断我的话。</td>
		<td class="en">“I was going to tell you all about it,” said Miss Bates, “if you hadn’t interrupted me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你一定知道玛吉·布朗吧；她有时住在这里。还有，她的身价有四千万美元呢。在泽西，她住十美元的公寓。她手头总有很多现金，甚至超过半打竞选副总统的生意人所持有的数目。我不清楚她是不是把现金都装在长筒袜里；不过我知道她在市中心那一带很受欢迎，那里的人个个都是拜金主义者。</td>
		<td class="en">“Of course, you know about Maggie Brown, who stops here.Well, she’s worth $40,000,000.She lives in Jersey in a ten-dollar flat.She’s always got more cash on hand than half a dozen business candidates for vice-president.I don’t know whether she carries it in her stocking or not, but I know she’s mighty popular down in the part of town where they worship the golden calf.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“大概两周前的一天，布朗夫人停在门口，上下打量了我十分钟之久。我侧身对着她坐着，正帮托诺帕来的一个和蔼的老头复印几份铜矿计划书。但我总能看到四周的一切。努力工作的时侯，我能透过侧面的发梳看东西；我会让衬衫式连衣裙后面的一颗扣子开着，以便看到谁在我后面。一周要挣到十八至二十美元，我没时间四下张望，而且我也用不着四下张望。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, about two weeks ago, Mrs. Brown stops at the door and rubbers at me for ten minutes.I’m sitting with my side to her, striking off some manifold copies of a copper-mine proposition for a nice old man from Tonopah.But I always see everything all around me.When I’m hard at work I can see things through my side-combs; and I can leave one button unbuttoned in the back of my shirtwaist and see who’s behind me.I didn’t look around, because I make from eighteen to twenty dollars a week, and I didn’t have to.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那天晚上下班时，她派人叫我去她的房间找她。我猜我得打印两千字左右的期票、抵押书、还有合同，而且只有十美分的小费；但我还是去了。真的，朋友，我着实吃了一惊。老玛吉·布朗竟然变得通人情了。</td>
		<td class="en">“That evening at knocking-off time she sends for me to come up to her apartment.I expected to have to typewrite about two thousand words of notes-of-hand, liens, and contracts, with a ten-cent tip in sight; but I went.Well, Man, I was certainly surprised.Old Maggie Brown had turned human.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘孩子’，她说，‘你是我一生见过的最美丽的人儿。我想让你辞掉工作，来和我一起住。我没什么亲友，’她说，‘除了一个丈夫和一两个儿子，但我和他们没有任何往来。他们生活太奢侈，我这个勤勉女人养不起他们。我希望你做我的女儿。他们说我吝啬抠门，报纸上也造谣说我自己洗衣做饭。这纯粹是造谣，’她继续说，‘除了手帕、长筒袜、衬裙和衣领，还有诸如此类的轻便东西，我的衣服差不多都送到外面洗。我有四千万美金，有现金，也有股票和债券，它们像美孚石油公司的股票一样好卖，在教会义卖会上很抢手。我是一个孤独的老女人，需要有人陪伴。你是我见过的最美的人。’她说，‘你愿意来和我一起住吗？我倒要让他们看看我会不会花钱。’她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Child,’ says she, ‘you’re the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life.I want you to quit your work and come and live with me.I’ve no kith or kin,’ says she, ‘except a husband and a son or two, and I hold no communication with any of ’em.They’re extravagant burdens on a hard-working woman.I want you to be a daughter to me.They say I’m stingy and mean, and the papers print lies about my doing my own cooking and washing.It’s a lie,’ she goes on.‘I put my washing out, except the handkerchiefs and stockings and petticoats and collars, and light stuff like that.I’ve got forty million dollars in cash and stocks and bonds that are as negotiable as Standard Oil, preferred, at a church fair.I’m a lonely old woman and I need companionship.You’re the most beautiful human being I ever saw,’ says she.‘Will you come and live with me?I’ll show ’em whether I can spend money or not,’ she says.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，朋友，要是你会怎么做？当然，我接受了。而且，老实说，我开始喜欢老玛吉了。不只是因为那四千万美元和她为我做的一切。在这个世界上我也有点儿寂寞。大家都得有个能听自己倾诉的人，说说左肩膀的疼痛，说说漆皮鞋怎么一裂口就穿坏了。你不可能和旅馆里碰到的男人谈论这类的事情——他们正找这样的空子呢。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, Man, what would you have done?Of course, I fell to it.And, to tell you the truth, I began to like old Maggie.It wasn’t all on account of the forty millions and what she could do for me.I was kind of lonesome in the world too.Everybody’s got to have somebody they can explain to about the pain in their left shoulder and how fast patent-leather shoes wear out when they begin to crack.And you can’t talk about such things to men you meet in hotels—they’re looking for just such openings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“于是我放弃了旅馆里的工作，去和布朗夫人一起生活了。显然，对她来说我似乎有一种魔力。每当我闲坐、读书或看杂志时，她会盯着我看，一看就是半个小时。</td>
		<td class="en">“So I gave up my job in the hotel and went with Mrs. Brown.I certainly seemed to have a mash on her.She’d look at me for half an hour at a time when I was sitting, reading, or looking at the magazines.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友，你猜猜看她都做了什么？她出手大方，像在科尼岛冲浪时溅起的波浪一样。她把我带到一个一流的裁缝那里，交给她一张订单，全是做给我的衣服——花多少钱都不在乎。而且都是加急订单，裁缝太太只好锁上店门，带着全体员工加班加点。</td>
		<td class="en">“And say, Man, what do you suppose she did?Loosened up like a Marcel wave in the surf at Coney.She took me to a swell dressmaker and gave her a la carte to fit me out—money no object.They were rush orders, and madame locked the front door and put the whole force to work.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“然后我们搬到——你猜哪里？——不对，再猜——对啦——邦顿酒店。我们住有六个房间的套房；每天一百美元。我看到账单了。我开始爱上那个老女人了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Then we moved to—where do you think?—no; guess again—that’s right—the Hotel Bonton.We had a six-room apartment; and it cost $100 a day.I saw the bill.I began to love that old lady.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“接着，朋友，我的衣服开始送来了——哎呀，我不想给你讲衣服的事！说了你也不懂。我开始叫她玛吉阿姨了。你肯定读过灰姑娘的故事吧。唉，我每天对自己说的话，比起王子把那只三号半的A型水晶鞋穿在灰姑娘脚上时她说的话，还要快活得多。</td>
		<td class="en">“And then, Man, when my dresses began to come in—oh, I won’t tell you about ’em! you couldn’t understand.And I began to call her Aunt Maggie.You’ve read about Cinderella, of course.Well, what Cinderella said when the prince fitted that 3-1/2 A on her foot was a hard-luck story compared to the things I told myself.</td></tr>
