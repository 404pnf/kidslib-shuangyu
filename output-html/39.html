		<td class="en">by Oscar Wilde</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们在许多方面都受惠于歌德非凡的美学天赋，比如是他第一个教导我们要尽可能以最具体的语词去界说美，也就是说，总是以其特殊形态去表现美。因此，在我有幸献给诸位的这次演讲中，我将不会试图向大家提供任何关于美的抽象定义——任何18世纪的哲学家所找寻的那种关于美的普适性公式——更不会去阐述那种一幅画或是一首诗借以引发我们独特愉悦感的品质，因为其本质是不可言说的；而是想向各位指出那些刻画出了本世纪这场伟大的英国文艺复兴的总体思想，从而尽可能深地探寻它们的源流，同时尽可能远地预测它们的未来。</td>
		<td class="en">Among the many debts which we owe to the supreme aesthetic faculty of Goethe is that he was the first to teach us to define beauty in terms the most concrete possible, to realise it, I mean, always in its special manifestations.So, in the lecture which I have the honour to deliver before you, I will not try to give you any abstract definition of beauty—any such universal formula for it as was sought for by the philosophy of the eighteenth century—still less to communicate to you that which in its essence is incommunicable, the virtue by which a particular picture or poem affects us with a unique and special joy; but rather to point out to you the general ideas which characterise the great English Renaissance of Art in this century, to discover their source, as far as that is possible, and to estimate their future as far as that is possible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我称其为“我们的英国文艺复兴”，是因为正如15世纪伟大的意大利文艺复兴一样，它的确像是人类精神的一次新生，体现在它对更为美好安逸的生活方式的追求，对肌体之美的热忱，对形式的极度专注，对新的诗歌题材、新的艺术样式以及新的思想与想象乐趣的探索。我又将其称为我们的浪漫派运动，因为它是我们最近的一次对于美的表达。</td>
		<td class="en">I call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort of new birth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century, in its desire for a more gracious and comely way of life, its passion for physical beauty, its exclusive attention to form, its seeking for new subjects for poetry, new forms of art, new intellectual and imaginative enjoyments: and I call it our romantic movement because it is our most recent expression of beauty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这场运动曾被描述成是单纯的希腊思想方式的复兴，也曾被说成是中世纪情感的一种简单的复活。而我却更愿意这样认为：在上述人类精神样态中，增加了现代社会的纷繁、复杂，以及体验所能提供的一切艺术价值。它从前者取得景象的清明与恒久的静穆，从后者取得表现的丰富与景象的神秘。歌德曾说，倘非为了反观现实世界，研究古人又能为了什么呢（因为这正是他们所做的）？马志尼也曾说，若非个性，中世纪精神又能是什么呢？</td>
		<td class="en">It has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of thought, and again as a mere revival of mediaeval feeling.Rather I would say that to these forms of the human spirit it has added whatever of artistic value the intricacy and complexity and experience of modern life can give: taking from the one its clearness of vision and its sustained calm, from the other its variety of expression and the mystery of its vision.For what, as Goethe said, is the study of the ancients but a return to the real world (for that is what they did); and what, said Mazzini, is mediaevalism but individuality?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正是境界开阔、意向通明、静穆优美的希腊精神同来自异邦、个性张扬、色彩炽烈的浪漫精神的融汇，激发出了19世纪的英国文艺，正如浮士德与特洛伊的海伦的结合诞下了那个漂亮男孩欧福良一般。</td>
		<td class="en">It is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, its sanity of purpose, its calm possession of beauty, with the adventive, the intensified individualism, the passionate colour of the romantic spirit, that springs the art of the nineteenth century in England, as from the marriage of Faust and Helen of Troy sprang the beautiful boy Euphorion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >诚然，“古典”和“浪漫”这类词语常常易于成为各流派的标签。我们必须始终记住，艺术只有一言相告：对于她，有且仅有一条最高法则，那就是形式之法则，或曰和谐之法则——然而在古典主义精神与浪漫主义精神之间，我们或许可以认为至少存在这样的区别，即前者处理的是大众典型，而后者处理的是少数例外。自现代浪漫主义精神中产生的作品，处理的不再是生之永恒与生活之本真；艺术所寻求的，是对古典精神的瞬间处境以及浪漫精神的瞬间样貌的展示。作为古典精神的典型代表，雕塑方面，主题较情境更为重要；而作为浪漫精神的典型，在绘画方面，情境则超越主题成为主导。</td>
		<td class="en">Such expressions as ‘classical’ and ‘romantic’ are, it is true, often apt to become the mere catchwords of schools.We must always remember that art has only one sentence to utter: there is for her only one high law, the law of form or harmony—yet between the classical and romantic spirit we may say that there lies this difference at least, that the one deals with the type and the other with the exception.In the work produced under the modern romantic spirit it is no longer the permanent, the essential truths of life that are treated of; it is the momentary situation of the one, the momentary aspect of the other that art seeks to render.In sculpture, which is the type of one spirit, the subject predominates over the situation; in painting, which is the type of the other, the situation predominates over the subject.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如此便有了两种精神：希腊精神与浪漫精神，它们或许可以被视为构成我们有意识的理性传统与恒久的鉴赏标准的基本要素。若论根由，在艺术中一如在政治里，只有一个原因能引起所有的变革：为了人类能够过上更高尚的生活，为了能够拥有更为自由的表达方式与选择。然而，我认为在评价主导我们英国文艺复兴的感性与理性精神时，任何将其与这个时代的社会生活进程和运动隔离开来的尝试都将剥夺它真正的生命力，可能会误解它的真正意义。当把那些有关艺术和热爱艺术的激情与追求从这个拥挤的现代社会的所有追求与激情中分离开来时，我们必须将许多貌似与此类艺术感受截然相反的诸多重大历史事件纳入考虑范围。</td>
		<td class="en">There are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the spirit of romance may be taken as forming the essential elements of our conscious intellectual tradition, of our permanent standard of taste.As regards their origin, in art as in politics there is but one origin for all revolutions, a desire on the part of man for a nobler form of life, for a freer method and opportunity of expression.Yet, I think that in estimating the sensuous and intellectual spirit which presides over our English Renaissance, any attempt to isolate it in any way from in the progress and movement and social life of the age that has produced it would be to rob it of its true vitality, possibly to mistake its true meaning.And in disengaging from the pursuits and passions of this crowded modern world those passions and pursuits which have to do with art and the love of art, we must take into account many great events of history which seem to be the most opposed to any such artistic feeling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于对纯美的狂热崇拜，对形式的不懈追求，以及天然的排外与敏感特性，我们的英国文艺复兴看起来必然异于任何狂躁的政治热情，或是叛乱草莽的刺耳嗓音，可我们仍须从法国大革命中找寻它所以产生的首要因素，它诞生的最初环境：尽管我们有些人通常正是它的高声反对者，我们都是这场大革命的孩子；尽管曾有一时连柯勒律治与华兹华斯这样伟大的灵魂也在英国对它丧失了信心，但崇高的仁爱之声仍越过海洋从你们年轻的共和国传来。</td>
		<td class="en">Alien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harsh voice of a rude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance must seem, in its passionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless devotion to form, its exclusive and sensitive nature, it is to the French Revolution that we must look for the most primary factor of its production, the first condition of its birth: that great Revolution of which we are all the children though the voices of some of us be often loud against it; that Revolution to which at a time when even such spirits as Coleridge and Wordsworth lost heart in England, noble messages of love blown across seas came from your young Republic.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >诚然，我们对于历史承续性的现代理解告诉我们，无论在政治领域还是自然界都只存在进化而绝无革命，而1789年那场席卷法国并使欧洲的每一位君主都为自己的王位战战兢兢的狂风暴雨的前奏，却在巴士底狱被攻陷以及卢浮宫被占领之前早已回响在文学纪元中了。为塞纳河与卢瓦尔河畔的那些红色场景铺就道路的是德国与英国的批判精神，它使人们惯于将一切事物都置于理性、功利或者二者共同的检验之中，而巴黎街头民众的不满正是对爱弥儿和维特的生活的共鸣。卢梭在宁静的山间湖畔召唤人类返归那犹然存在的黄金时代，宣扬回归自然，其激情洋溢的雄辩之声仍旋绕在我们北方凛冽的空气中。而歌德与司各特已将浪漫色彩从它被监禁数世的牢狱中再度放回——若非人性，浪漫色彩又能是什么呢？</td>
		<td class="en">It is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history has shown us that neither in politics nor in nature are there revolutions ever but evolutions only, and that the prelude to that wild storm which swept over France in 1789 and made every king in Europe tremble for his throne, was first sounded in literature years before the Bastille fell and the Palace was taken.The way for those red scenes by Seine and Loire was paved by that critical spirit of Germany and England which accustomed men to bring all things to the test of reason or utility or both, while the discontent of the people in the streets of Paris was the echo that followed the life of Emile and of Werther.For Rousseau, by silent lake and mountain, had called humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us and preached a return to nature, in passionate eloquence whose music still lingers about our keen northern air. And Goethe and Scott had brought romance back again from the prison she had lain in for so many centuries—and what is romance but humanity?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而在革命孕育之时，在那个狂躁时代的风暴与恐怖之中，各种趋向都被隐藏起来，一旦时机来临，文艺复兴就会自行酝酿成熟——起初是科学趋向，它给我们的时代带来一群略显喧闹的巨人，而在诗歌领域却也不会毫无收获。我所指的不仅是科学为激情增添了其力量之中的理性基础，或者当华兹华斯无比精辟地说出诗歌在科学面前只是些慷慨之辞，一旦科学得赋血肉之形，诗人当将其非凡灵思出借以助此转化时，科学对他的思想产生了更为显著的影响。我也不是要将思绪过多缠绕在伟大的宇宙情感与深奥的科学泛神论问题上，雪莱与斯温伯恩已经分别为此唱响了第一次与最近一次的颂歌。我注重的是在保持作为真正艺术家之特征的观察细致，以及在界限感和视野的明晰度方面，科学对艺术精神的影响。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm and terror of that wild time, tendencies were hidden away that the artistic Renaissance bent to her own service when the time came—a scientific tendency first, which has borne in our own day a brood of somewhat noisy Titans, yet in the sphere of poetry has not been unproductive of good.I do not mean merely in its adding to enthusiasm that intellectual basis which in its strength, or that more obvious influence about which Wordsworth was thinking when he said very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned expression in the face of science, and that when science would put on a form of flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration.Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotion and deep pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its first and Swinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influence on the artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and the sense of limitation as well as of clearness of vision which are the characteristics of the real artist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >威廉·布莱克写道，艺术与生活的至高黄金法则是，对界限定义得越清楚、越明晰，则艺术作品越完美；反之，界限越不明晰，越不清楚，苍白模仿与拙劣剽窃的证据便越显著。“任何时代的伟大创造者都清楚这一点——米开朗琪罗与阿尔布雷特·丢勒就是且仅是因此而闻名的。”后来他又用19世纪散文的那种简单直率语气写道：“模糊不清就会成为蠢材。”</td>
		<td class="en">The great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote William Blake, is that the more distinct, sharp and defined the boundary line, the more perfect is the work of art; and the less keen and sharp the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism and bungling.‘Great inventors in all ages knew this—Michael Angelo and Albert Durer are known by this and by this alone’; and another time he wrote, with all the simple directness of nineteenth-century prose, ‘to generalise is to be an idiot.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而这种对确切概念的爱好，这种视野的明晰度，这种艺术的界限感，正是一切伟大作品与诗歌的主要特征，是荷马之想象与但丁之想象的特征，也是济慈和威廉·莫里斯与乔叟和忒奥克里托斯之想象的特征。它作为一切崇高的现实主义与浪漫主义作品的基础，拒斥着我们的18世纪诗人与法国古典派戏剧家，或者德国感伤主义流派的含混精神所带有的那种苍白空洞的抽象性；它也拒斥了先验论精神，后者同样是在这次大革命中生根发芽、开花结果，既为华兹华斯充满热情的沉思夯实了基础，也为鹰隼般飞翔的雪莱提供了羽翅与激情。而在哲学领域，尽管在我们这个时代，先验主义已被唯物主义与实证主义所取代，但却派生出牛津的纽曼学派与美国的爱默生学派这两大思想流派。然而，这种先验论精神与艺术精神毫不合辙。因为艺术家无法接受以某个生活领域去取代生活本身。对他而言，不存在对尘世束缚的逃离，甚至不存在想要逃离的欲望。</td>
		<td class="en">And this love of definite conception, this clearness of vision, this artistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of all great work and poetry; of the vision of Homer as of the vision of Dante, of Keats and William Morris as of Chaucer and Theocritus.It lies at the base of all noble, realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty abstractions of our own eighteenth-century poets and of the classical dramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of the German sentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of transcendentalism which also was root and flower itself of the great Revolution, underlying the impassioned contemplation of Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to the eagle-like flight of Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy, though displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day, bequeathed two great schools of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford, the school of Emerson to America.Yet is this spirit of transcendentalism alien to the spirit of art.For the artist can accept no sphere of life in exchange for life itself.For him there is no escape from the bondage of the earth: there is not even the desire of escape.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艺术家才是唯一真正的现实主义者：象征作为先验精神的精髓，与他格格不入。亚细亚的玄学思想能为自己创造出以弗所骇人的多乳女神像，但对于希腊人这种纯粹的艺术家，那件作品却充满精神生活的盎然生机，是肉体生活的完美事实与其精神生活最为清晰的印证。</td>
		<td class="en">He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the essence of the transcendental spirit, is alien to him.The metaphysical mind of Asia will create for itself the monstrous, many-breasted idol of Ephesus, but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“革命的狂风骤雨，”正如安德列·谢尼耶所言，“吹熄了诗歌的火把。”这股事变的狂野洪流所产生的真正影响一时间并不会动摇。最初，对平等的渴求看起来树立起了世人前所未知的更为巨大的形象。人们听过拜伦的琴声与拿破仑的神话，那是一段充满了无尽激情与绝望的岁月，不满与野心成为生活和艺术的和音；那是个反叛的时代，一个人类精神必然历经却无法停留的阶段。因为文明的目的并非暴乱而是和平，夜间有着无知军队厮杀的险恶山谷不是文明的栖身之所，众神为她安排的是芳草鲜美的高地，阳光灿烂的山巅，以及洁净平和的空气。</td>
		<td class="en">‘The storm of revolution,’ as Andre Chenier said, ‘blows out the torch of poetry.’ It is not for some little time that the real influence of such a wild cataclysm of things is felt: at first the desire for equality seems to have produced personalities of more giant and Titan stature than the world had ever known before.Men heard the lyre of Byron and the legions of Napoleon; it was a period of measureless passions and of measureless despair; ambition, discontent, were the chords of life and art; the age was an age of revolt: a phase through which the human spirit must pass, but one in which it cannot rest.For the aim of culture is not rebellion but peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash by night being no dwelling-place meet for her to whom the gods have assigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear, untroubled air.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快，那份存于大革命根底之中的对完美的渴望，便在一位年轻的英国诗人身上找到了它最完满无缺的体现。</td>
		<td class="en">And soon that desire for perfection, which lay at the base of the Revolution, found in a young English poet its most complete and flawless realisation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >荷马身上已预示出菲狄亚斯与希腊艺术的成就；但丁为我们提前呈现了意大利绘画的激情、色彩与密度；现代人对风景画的热爱始于卢梭；而在济慈那里便可见得英国文艺复兴的滥觞。</td>
		<td class="en">Phidias and the achievements of Greek art are foreshadowed in Homer: Dante prefigures for us the passion and colour and intensity of Italian painting: the modern love of landscape dates from Rousseau, and it is in Keats that one discerns the beginning of the artistic renaissance of England.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拜伦是个叛逆者，雪莱是个梦想家。可论及沉静而明晰的视野，完美的自我节制，对美无懈可击的感受力，以及对想象这一独立王国的关注，济慈才是纯粹而平和的艺术家，是拉斐尔前派以及我将要论及的这场伟大浪漫主义运动的先驱。</td>
		<td class="en">Byron was a rebel and Shelley a dreamer; but in the calmness and clearness of his vision, his perfect self-control, his unerring sense of beauty and his recognition of a separate realm for the imagination, Keats was the pure and serene artist, the forerunner of the pre-Raphaelite school, and so of the great romantic movement of which I am to speak.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >诚然，布莱克先于济慈宣称艺术是一项崇高的精神使命，并曾力求将构思提升到诗歌与音乐的理想层次，然而他在绘画与诗歌视野上的偏颇以及技术实力方面的欠缺，都导致他的努力未能产生任何真正的影响力。只有在济慈那里，这个世纪的艺术精神才首次找到了它的最佳化身。</td>
		<td class="en">Blake had indeed, before him, claimed for art a lofty, spiritual mission, and had striven to raise design to the ideal level of poetry and music, but the remoteness of his vision both in painting and poetry and the incompleteness of his technical powers had been adverse to any real influence.It is in Keats that the artistic spirit of this century first found its absolute incarnation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而那些拉斐尔前派成员，他们是什么人？如果你向英国公众询问“美学”这个词的意义，他们十有八九会告诉你，这是法语词“做作”或者德语的“墙裙”是意思；如果你打听“拉斐尔前派”，你会听到这种说法：那是一群行事古怪的年轻人，对他们来说绘画中对神性的歪曲和对圣洁的亵渎是艺术的主要表现对象。对本国的伟大人物一无所知正是英国教育的一个必要组成部分。</td>
		<td class="en">And these pre-Raphaelites, what were they?If you ask nine-tenths of the British public what is the meaning of the word aesthetics, they will tell you it is the French for affectation or the German for a dado; and if you inquire about the pre-Raphaelites you will hear something about an eccentric lot of young men to whom a sort of divine crookedness and holy awkwardness in drawing were the chief objects of art. To know nothing about their great men is one of the necessary elements of English education.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于拉斐尔前派，故事则足够简单。1847年，一群伦敦的年轻人——对济慈充满敬佩之情的诗人和画家——形成了聚在一处讨论艺术的习惯。这样讨论的结果是，由于听说他们之中有那么一伙年轻人决心变革英国的绘画与诗歌，英国非艺术界的公众忽然从他们平素的漠然中觉醒了。这些年轻人就将自己称为拉斐尔前派成员。</td>
		<td class="en">As regards the pre-Raphaelites the story is simple enough.In the year 1847 a number of young men in London, poets and painters, passionate admirers of Keats all of them, formed the habit of meeting together for discussions on art, the result of such discussions being that the English Philistine public was roused suddenly from its ordinary apathy by hearing that there was in its midst a body of young men who had determined to revolutionise English painting and poetry.They called themselves the pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在当时的英国，和此时一样，一个人若是试图创造任何严肃优美的作品，都会牺牲他作为一个公民的全部权利。不仅如此，这些拉斐尔前派成员——在他们之中有这样几个耳熟能详的名字：丹特·罗塞蒂，霍尔曼·亨特，以及米莱斯——拥有三样英国民众无论如何也无法原谅的东西：青春、能力和激情。</td>
		<td class="en">In England, then as now, it was enough for a man to try and produce any serious beautiful work to lose all his rights as a citizen; and besides this, the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood—among whom the names of Dante Rossetti, Holman Hunt and Millais will be familiar to you—had on their side three things that the English public never forgives: youth, power and enthusiasm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >讥讽，既可耻又贫乏无力，既侮慢又软弱无能，提供了通常庸众对天才所能给予的敬意——从古至今都为公众带来无穷祸患，蒙蔽他们发现美的双眼，教他们以傲慢这一生活中一切邪恶与狭隘的源泉。然而，这不但全然不会伤害到艺术家本人，反而会使他更加坚信自己的作品与志向完全正确。因为能与四分之三的英国公众在所有问题上见解相左正是心智健全的首个要素，是任何时候对精神疑惧的最有效的慰藉。</td>
		<td class="en">Satire, always as sterile as it in shameful and as impotent as it is insolent, paid them that usual homage which mediocrity pays to genius—doing, here as always, infinite harm to the public, blinding them to what is beautiful, teaching them that irreverence which is the source of all vileness and narrowness of life, but harming the artist not at all, rather confirming him in the perfect rightness of his work and ambition.For to disagree with three-fourths of the British public on all points is one of the first elements of sanity, one of the deepest consolations in all moments of spiritual doubt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于那些年轻人为英国艺术的新生而产生的思想观念，我们或许可以从他们艺术创作的根基上发现一种渴望，一种想要给艺术带去更深层的精神价值与更丰富的装饰价值的渴望。</td>
		<td class="en">As regards the ideas these young men brought to the regeneration of English art, we may see at the base of their artistic creations a desire for a deeper spiritual value to be given to art as well as a more decorative value.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们自称拉斐尔前派，却完全没有模仿那些早期的意大利巨匠，而是与拉斐尔柔和的抽象性相反，他们在自己的作品中找到了一种更具想象力、技法更细腻的现实主义，一种能够瞬间显得更为热切生动的意境，一种更本真也更张扬的个性。</td>
		<td class="en">Pre-Raphaelites they called themselves; not that they imitated the early Italian masters at all, but that in their work, as opposed to the facile abstractions of Raphael, they found a stronger realism of imagination, a more careful realism of technique, a vision at once more fervent and more vivid, an individuality more intimate and more intense.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为一件艺术作品仅仅符合其时代的审美需求是不够的，倘若它想以永恒的欢愉打动我们，还必须具备鲜明的个性特征，这种个性迥异于常人，并且仅靠作品中的某个新奇巧妙之处走近我们，而正是这种表现手法的陌生化使我们更乐于接受它们。</td>
		<td class="en">For it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the aesthetic demands of its age: there must be also about it, if it is to affect us with any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct individuality, an individuality remote from that of ordinary men, and coming near to us only by virtue of a certain newness and wonder in the work, and through channels whose very strangeness makes us more ready to give them welcome.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >法国一个最伟大的现代批评家曾说：个性就是拯救我们的面纱。</td>
		<td class="en">LA PERSONNALITE, said one of the greatest of modem French critics, VOILE CE QUI NOUS SAUVERA.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但最重要的是，这一个性是对自然的回归——这种套话似乎适合太多此类多样化运动——他们只描绘自己见到的事物，他们可以试着想象各种事情，就像它们都真实发生过一样。后来,这些年轻的拉斐尔前派成员通常用来聚会和工作的那所黑僧桥畔的老宅子里，来了两个来自牛津的年轻人，爱德华·伯恩·琼斯与威廉·莫里斯——后者以一种对选择更精细的精神，对美更执着的热爱，对完美更强烈的追求，取代了早期较为简单的现实主义，他是一切精美设计与精神图景的大师。他认为完全模仿自然是想象性艺术的一种干扰因素，与其说他是威尼斯画派的传人，不如说是佛罗伦萨画派的嫡系。现代生活的有形表象非但无法干扰他，反而会助他表现所有希腊、意大利和凯尔特的美好神话中的永恒性。莫里斯的诗歌以无比精确的措辞和干净的画面福泽了我们的视听，在我国文学作品中至今未有出其右者。他还通过装饰性艺术的复兴运动，赋予我们个性化的浪漫主义运动以社会观念与社会因素。</td>
		<td class="en">But above all things was it a return to Nature—that formula which seems to suit so many and such diverse movements: they would draw and paint nothing but what they saw, they would try and imagine things as they really happened.Later there came to the old house by Blackfriars Bridge, where this young brotherhood used to meet and work, two young men from Oxford, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris—the latter substituting for the simpler realism of the early days a more exquisite spirit of choice, a more faultless devotion to beauty, a more intense seeking for perfection: a master of all exquisite design and of all spiritual vision.It is of the school of Florence rather than of that of Venice that he is kinsman, feeling that the close imitation of Nature is a disturbing element in imaginative art. The visible aspect of modern life disturbs him not; rather is it for him to render eternal all that is beautiful in Greek, Italian, and Celtic legend.To Morris we owe poetry whose perfect precision and clearness of word and vision has not been excelled in the literature of our country, and by the revival of the decorative arts he has given to our individualised romantic movement the social idea and the social factor also.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，这伙年轻人在罗斯金那滴水不漏、热情洋溢的雄辩支持下完成的革命，不仅是思想的革命也是行动的革命，不仅是概念的革命也是创作的革命。</td>
		<td class="en">But the revolution accomplished by this clique of young men, with Ruskin’s faultless and fervent eloquence to help them, was not one of ideas merely but of execution, not one of conceptions but of creations.</td></tr>

Wordsworth’s definition of poetry as ‘emotion remembered in tranquillity’ may be taken as an analysis of one of the stages through which all imaginative work has to pass; and in Keats’s longing to be ‘able to compose without this fever’ (I quote from one of his letters), his desire to substitute for poetic ardour ‘a more thoughtful and quiet power,’ we may discern the most important moment in the evolution of that artistic life.The question made an early and strange appearance in your literature too; and I need not remind you how deeply the young poets of the French romantic movement were excited and stirred by Edgar Allan Poe’s analysis of the workings of his own imagination in the creating of that supreme imaginative work which we know by the name of The Raven.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而我也坚信，赋予制作者和使用者以愉悦感是装饰艺术最基本的一条原则，如果我们使自己只置身于这样的艺术品中，那么随之而来的裨益将是不可估量的。至少，我认为有一件事可以帮助我们：检验一个国家是否伟大最可靠的方法莫过于看它与它的诗人有多么亲近。然而，在我们时代的歌手与他们为之歌咏的劳动者之间似乎横亘着一条宽阔鸿沟，一条毁谤与嘲弄无法跨越，而只能借助爱那闪光的翅膀飞跃的鸿沟。</td>
		<td class="en">And indeed I think it would be impossible to overrate the gain that might follow if we had about us only what gave pleasure to the maker of it and gives pleasure to its user, that being the simplest of all rules about decoration.One thing, at least, I think it would do for us: there is no surer test of a great country than how near it stands to its own poets; but between the singers of our day and the workers to whom they would sing there seems to be an ever-widening and dividing chasm, a chasm which slander and mockery cannot traverse, but which is spanned by the luminous wings of love.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我想那些持续出现在我们室内的优秀的想象作品就会为那样的爱埋下种子，成为最坚实的铺垫。我所指的艺术形式并不仅仅是直接通过文字表达的艺术，而是一个希腊男孩能够早在他身处拥挤的闹市或是大理石剧场之前，便从一个盛油或盛酒的红黑相间的小陶罐上了解阿喀琉斯狮子般的雄壮，赫克托耳的孔武有力，帕里斯的英俊潇洒与海伦的绝世美貌；或者一个15世纪的意大利儿童从雕花门廊与彩绘木箱上就能了解鲁克丽丝的贞操与卡密拉之死。因为我们从艺术中获得的好处并非是我们从中学到了什么，而是我们由之成为了什么。它的真正影响在于赋予心灵以激情这一希腊精神的奥秘，在于使心灵习惯于要求艺术在重构普通的生活现实时为我们做它所能做的一切——无论通过对一个人最具激情的瞬间做出最为精神性的解释，还是通过赋予那些与感官相距最远的思想以最具审美感受力的表达——在于使心灵习惯于为艺术本身去热爱那些想象的产物，习惯于从一切事物中探求美与优雅。因为，不是对一切事物中的艺术都热爱的人就根本不热爱艺术，不是对一切事物中的艺术都需要的人就根本不需要艺术。</td>
		<td class="en">And of such love I think that the abiding presence in our houses of noble imaginative work would be the surest seed and preparation.I do not mean merely as regards that direct literary expression of art by which, from the little red-and-black cruse of oil or wine, a Greek boy could learn of the lionlike splendour of Achilles, of the strength of Hector and the beauty of Paris and the wonder of Helen, long before he stood and listened in crowded market-place or in theatre of marble; or by which an Italian child of the fifteenth century could know of the chastity of Lucrece and the death of Camilla from carven doorway and from painted chest.For the good we get from art is not what we learn from it; it is what we become through it.Its real influence will be in giving the mind that enthusiasm which is the secret of Hellenism, accustoming it to demand from art all that art can do in rearranging the facts of common life for us—whether it be by giving the most spiritual interpretation of one’s own moments of highest passion or the most sensuous expression of those thoughts that are the farthest removed from sense; in accustoming it to love the things of the imagination for their own sake, and to desire beauty and grace in all things.For he who does not love art in all things does not love it at all, and he who does not need art in all things does not need it at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我不打算在此详述我们宏伟的哥特式大教堂，我确信其中有使你们每个人感到愉悦的东西。我想说的是，那个时代的艺术家（同时也是石刻或玻璃匠人）如何从他身边随处可见的工匠们的日常工作中——就像从那些美丽的沙特尔大教堂窗玻璃中——找到了他永远现成且永远美丽的最佳艺术动机。在那里，染工浸在染缸里，陶工坐在转盘边，织工站在织机前：这些才是真正的制造者，亲手劳作的工匠，他们才是赏心悦目的风景。不像我们这个时代那些自命不凡又枯燥乏味的商店店员，他们对于自己售出的织物和花瓶一无所知，只知道索要双倍的价钱，并且认为把它们买下来的人是个白痴。我还不得不顺带指出希腊和意大利的装饰艺术品对它们的艺术家产生的巨大影响：前者教给雕塑家设计的节制作用，那便是帕特农神庙的辉煌，后者使绘画始终忠于它华美色彩的最基本绘画条件，即威尼斯画派的秘诀。因为至少在这次演讲中，我更希望详细探讨的是装饰艺术对人类生活的影响——讨论一下它的社会影响而非纯粹的艺术效果。</td>
		<td class="en">I will not dwell here on what I am sure has delighted you all in our great Gothic cathedrals.I mean how the artist of that time, handicraftsman himself in stone or glass, found the best motives for his art, always ready for his hand and always beautiful, in the daily work of the artificers he saw around him—as in those lovely windows of Chartres—where the dyer dips in the vat and the potter sits at the wheel, and the weaver stands at the loom: real manufacturers these, workers with the hand, and entirely delightful to look at, not like the smug and vapid shopman of our time, who knows nothing of the web or vase he sells, except that he is charging you double its value and thinking you a fool for buying it. Nor can I but just note, in passing, the immense influence the decorative work of Greece and Italy had on its artists, the one teaching the sculptor that restraining influence of design which is the glory of the Parthenon, the other keeping painting always true to its primary, pictorial condition of noble colour which is the secret of the school of Venice; for I wish rather, in this lecture at least, to dwell on the effect that decorative art has on human life—on its social not its purely artistic effect.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这世上存在两种人，两种伟大的信条，两种不同的心性：一种人以行动为生活之根本，一种人以思想为生活之根本。且说后者，他们追求的是体验本身而非经历的结果，他们必会为这滚滚红尘中的某种热情所激荡，他们认为生活的乐趣不在于它的奥秘而在于它的情境，不在于它的目的而在于它每一次的悸动；由装饰艺术所产生的对美的热情于他们而言较之任何政治或宗教热忱，任何对人性的激情，任何爱之狂喜与悲伤，都更加惬意。因为艺术走近一个人时首先宣称的便是为他带去最高质量的瞬间，并且只为带去这些瞬间而已。以上便是那些以思想为生活之根本者的情况。至于另一类人，他们认为生活与劳动不可分离，对他们而言这场运动应该格外亲切：因为，如果说没有了工业，我们的时代便是贫瘠的，那么没有了艺术，工业就是野蛮的。</td>
		<td class="en">There are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, two different forms of natures: men to whom the end of life is action, and men to whom the end of life is thought. As regards the latter, who seek for experience itself and not for the fruits of experience, who must burn always with one of the passions of this fiery-coloured world, who find life interesting not for its secret but for its situations, for its pulsations and not for its purpose; the passion for beauty engendered by the decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any political or religious enthusiasm, any enthusiasm for humanity, any ecstasy or sorrow for love.For art comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but the highest quality to one’s moments, and for those moments’ sake.So far for those to whom the end of life is thought. As regards the others, who hold that life is inseparable from labour, to them should this movement be specially dear: for, if our days are barren without industry, industry without art is barbarism.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伐木人与汲水者的确会始终存在在我们中间。毕竟我们的现代机械也未能减轻多少人力劳动，但至少把立于井边的水罐变得漂亮，日间的劳作就能更轻松一点儿；把木头制成某些可爱的形状，某种优雅的造型，那么劳动的人们便能欣然相对而非牢骚满腹了。因为若非劳动者在工作中对愉悦情绪的表达，装饰艺术又能是什么呢？但不仅是愉悦的情绪——虽然那很重要，却并不足够——还有表现其自身个性的机会，作为一切生命的精髓，它也是一切艺术的源泉。“我曾试图，”我记得有一次威廉·莫里斯对我说，“我曾试图使我的每一位工匠都成为艺术家，而当我说到艺术家，我指的是人。”那么对于劳动者，无论他是做哪个行当的手艺人，艺术都不再是那件由奴隶织就、披在麻风病国王白化的身躯上借以遮掩和妆点他放荡罪孽的紫色长袍，而是对一个兼具美与高尚的生命所作的美好而高尚的表达。</td>
		<td class="en">Hewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed among us. Our modern machinery has not much lightened the labour of man after all: but at least let the pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and surely the labour of the day will be lightened: let the wood be made receptive of some lovely form, some gracious design, and there will come no longer discontent but joy to the toiler.For what is decoration but the worker’s expression of joy in his work?And not joy merely—that is a great thing yet not enough—but that opportunity of expressing his own individuality which, as it is the essence of all life, is the source of all art.‘I have tried,’ I remember William Morris saying to me once, ‘I have tried to make each of my workers an artist, and when I say an artist I mean a man.’ For the worker then, handicraftsman of whatever kind he is, art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his luxury, but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has in it something beautiful and noble.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此你们必须找出你们的工匠，并且尽可能给予他适当的环境，因为要记住，一个工匠真正的明证与美德既不是他的诚恳也不是他的勤勉，而只是他进行设计的能力。这种“设计绝非漫无目的的幻想的产物，它是累积观察与良好习惯有意为之的结果。”如果不使你们的工匠处于快乐的影响下，不使他们被美好的事物包围，世间的一切教育就将徒劳无功。不亲眼见到自然本真的宜人色彩，他便不可能树立对于色彩的正确观念；不亲眼见到世间的美好事物与行为，他便不可能提供美好的事物与行为。</td>
		<td class="en">And so you must seek out your workman and give him, as far as possible, the right surroundings, for remember that the real test and virtue of a workman is not his earnestness nor his industry even, but his power of design merely; and that ‘design is not the offspring of idle fancy: it is the studied result of accumulative observation and delightful habit.’ All the teaching in the world is of no avail if you do not surround your workman with happy influences and with beautiful things.It is impossible for him to have right ideas about colour unless he sees the lovely colours of Nature unspoiled; impossible for him to supply beautiful incident and action unless he sees beautiful incident and action in the world about him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为若要培养同情心，你必得置身于活生生的事物之中思考它们；若要培养敬慕心，你必得置身美丽的事物之中观赏它们。如鲁斯金先生所言：“托莱多的钢铁与热那亚的丝绸仅仅增添了压迫的力量与自傲的光辉。”请你们创造这样一种艺术，它出自人民之手，为着人民的欢乐，也为了取悦民心，这一艺术将表现出你们生活的乐趣。没有什么东西是“日常生活与普通事物里过于粗陋琐屑以至于无法在你的触摸下得到升华的”；艺术能将生活中的一切变得神圣。</td>
		<td class="en">For to cultivate sympathy you must be among living things and thinking about them, and to cultivate admiration you must be among beautiful things and looking at them.‘The steel of Toledo and the silk of Genoa did but give strength to oppression and lustre to pride,’ as Mr. Ruskin says; let it be for you to create an art that is made by the hands of the people for the joy of the people, to please the hearts of the people, too; an art that will be your expression of your delight in life.There is nothing ‘in common life too mean, in common things too trivial to be ennobled by your touch’; nothing in life that art cannot sanctify.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我想，你们有些人应听说过那两种与英国的美学运动息息相关的花卉了，而且据说（我可以向你们保证这种说法的错误性）某些年轻的唯美主义者甚至以这两种花为食。那么，让我来告诉诸位我们所以喜爱百合花与向日葵的原因——无论吉尔伯特先生可能告诉你什么，都绝对与任何流行的植物时尚毫无关系。那是因为这两种可爱的花卉在英国就是最为完美的图案模型，最自然地被装饰艺术采纳——前者以其娇柔优雅的可爱，后者以其炫目、勇猛的美丽，给予画家最充分、最完满的愉悦。而你们也一样：让你们草地上的每一朵花都把它的藤蔓缠绕上你们的枕头；让你们巨大森林中的每一片树叶的形状都成为设计图案的蓝本；让每一条玫瑰或野蔷薇卷曲的花枝都永远地活现在雕花拱门、窗玻璃或大理石上；让你们空中的每一只小鸟都展示出它在日光下变幻不定的色彩，它在飞翔中双翅画出的美妙弧线使这份装饰简朴的宝藏更为珍贵。我们每个人都把岁月消耗在对生活之秘密的追寻中。而生活的秘密就在艺术之中。</td>
		<td class="en">You have heard, I think, a few of you, of two flowers connected with the aesthetic movement in England, and said (I assure you, erroneously) to be the food of some aesthetic young men. Well, let me tell you that the reason we love the lily and the sunflower, in spite of what Mr. Gilbert may tell you, is not for any vegetable fashion at all. It is because these two lovely flowers are in England the two most perfect models of design, the most naturally adapted for decorative art—the gaudy leonine beauty of the one and the precious loveliness of the other giving to the artist the most entire and perfect joy. And so with you: let there be no flower in your meadows that does not wreathe its tendrils around your pillows, no little leaf in your Titan forests that does not lend its form to design, no curving spray of wild rose or brier that does not live for ever in carven arch or window or marble, no bird in your air that is not giving the iridescent wonder of its colour, the exquisite curves of its wings in flight, to make more precious the preciousness of simple adornment.We spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret of life.Well, the secret of life is in art.</td></tr>
