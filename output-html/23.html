		<td class="en">I</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天清晨，当格雷戈尔·萨姆沙从恼人的梦中惊醒时，发现自己在床上变成了一只可怕的害虫。他躺在盔甲般的背上，稍一抬头就可以看到棕色的、微微鼓起、被一条条拱形分成僵硬的小块的肚皮。铺盖几乎都盖不住肚子，看上去随时都可能滑落下来。他那许多条腿，在身体其他部分的对比下，真是小得可怜。在他的注视下，它们无助地挥舞着。</td>
		<td class="en">One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.He lay on his armor-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我这是怎么了？”他想。这并不是在做梦。虽然他的房间非常小，但确实是个普通人的房间，静静地躺在四堵熟悉的墙壁之间。桌上平摊着一堆纺织物样品——萨姆沙是个旅行推销员——桌子正上方挂着一幅画。那幅画是他最近从插画杂志上剪下来的，并用镀金的漂亮相框装裱了起来。画上是一位贵妇，头戴裘皮帽，脖子上围着裘皮围巾，笔直地坐着。她扬起手臂，向观赏者展示着覆盖了整个小臂的厚重的裘皮手筒。</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s happened to me?” he thought.It wasn’t a dream.His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后，格雷戈尔转向窗外看了看阴沉沉的天气。雨滴击打着窗玻璃，这种声音让他感到非常忧伤。“不如我再多睡一会儿，把这些荒谬的事都忘了。”他这么想着，但是却做不到。因为他习惯朝右睡，而现在这种情况下，他没法换成那个姿势。不管他多么费劲地想让自己翻到右侧，最后总是滚回了原处。他怎么也试了有上百次。他闭着眼睛，这样就不必看那些挣扎着的腿。直到他开始感觉到一丝从未有过的隐约、轻微的疼痛时，才停止尝试。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense,” he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into that position.However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，天哪！”他心想，“我选择了一份多么辛苦的职业啊！日复一日地长途跋涉。做这种生意比自己在家做买卖更费精力，此外还有长途奔走带来的诸多弊端：一班接一班地赶火车，糟糕且不规律的饮食，每天与不同的人打交道——你永远都不可能了解任何人或是和他们成为朋友。让这一切都见鬼去吧！”他感觉腹部有阵轻微的瘙痒，于是倚着后背，慢慢将自己推向床头板，这样他就能更好地抬起头来。他找到了瘙痒处，看到上面被很多不知名的小白点覆盖着。他试着用一条腿触摸那里，却又迅速将其缩回，因为一碰到那里，他就不由自主地打了一个寒颤。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, God,” he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!Travelling day in and day out.Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them.It can all go to Hell!”He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又滑下来，恢复了先前的姿势。“总是起得太早，”他想，“会让你变得愚蠢。你应该拥有充足的睡眠。其他的旅行推销员都过着奢华的生活。比方说，不管哪天早上我回到旅馆誊写合同，那些绅士们总是还坐在那里吃早餐。我应该当着老板的面那样试试看，不过可能会被当场解雇。但是，谁知道呢，也许对我来说那再好不过了。要不是考虑到父母，我早就交上了辞呈。我会直接去找老板，告诉他我的真实想法，告诉他我想做什么，让他知道我的感受。他也许会惊讶得从桌子上跌下来！有趣的是，他总是坐在桌子上，盛气凌人地与自己的下属谈话。特别是他听力不是很好，你必须靠他足够近。好吧，仍然还有一线希望。一旦我攒够了钱来付清父母欠他的债务——我看还要五六年——到时候我肯定会那么干的。到那时我就会改头换面。不过当务之急是赶快起床，因为火车五点就要开了。”</td>
		<td class="en">He slid back into his former position.“Getting up early all the time,” he thought, “it makes you stupid.You’ve got to get enough sleep.Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.If I didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel.He’d fall right off his desk!And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do.That’s when I’ll make the big change.First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他看了下闹钟，它在五斗橱上滴滴答答地敲着。“上帝啊！”他想。五点半了，指针正静悄悄地往前移动。甚至已经过了五点半，差不多是六点差一刻。难道闹钟没响？同往常一样，他定了四点的闹钟，在床上应该看得见。闹钟肯定已经响过。是的，可是在那震动家具的巨大铃声中，他怎么可能安详地睡着呢？的确，他睡得并不安稳，但也许正是由于这样，他睡得更沉了。他现在该怎么办呢？下一班火车是七点，如果他想赶上这班车，就得火速行动。那堆样品还没打包，而且他觉得自己头脑一点也不清晰、精力一点也不充沛。即使他能赶上火车，也躲不过老板的怒火。因为办公室助理会在火车站目送五点钟的火车离开，他早就会向老板报告格雷戈尔一直没出现。助理是老板的走狗，没有一点骨气，一点也不体谅人。要是报告说自己生病了呢？但那也太牵强，太可疑了，因为在这五年的工作时间里，格雷戈尔从未生过病。老板肯定会带着医疗保险公司的医生去格雷戈尔家，斥责他的父母亲养了一个懒惰的儿子；他还会采纳医生的建议，不给任何赔偿。因为医生坚信没人生过病，很多人不过是懒得上班。再说，这样他不就完全不诚实了吗？事实上，除了睡了太久而有些极度困倦，格雷戈尔感觉非常好，甚至觉得比往常更饿了。</td>
		<td class="en">And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.“God in Heaven!” he thought.It was half past five and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to six.Had the alarm clock not rung?He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung.Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that.What should he do now?The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively.And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s not being there a long time ago.The office assistant was the boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding.What about if he reported sick?But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case?Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他仍匆忙地思索着所有这一切，还是无法决定是否要起床，这时六点三刻的钟声响了。离他头很近的那扇门上响起了一阵谨慎的敲门声。“格雷戈尔，”有人在喊——那是他的母亲，“七点差一刻了。你不是要出门吗？”多么温柔的声音！当格雷戈尔听到自己的回答时，感到非常震惊，那根本就不像他以前的声音。他现在的声音中仿佛杂着一种来自身体深处的、痛苦的、无法控制的吱吱声。开始的时候，这些话语还可以分辨出来，但是随后响起了一阵回音，让话语变得很模糊，让听者无法确定有没有听清。格雷戈尔想给一个圆满的答案来解释一切；但是在这种情况下，他只能安慰自己说：“好的，妈妈，好的，谢谢！我这就起来。”隔着木头门，外面的人可能没有觉察到格雷戈尔的声音发生了变化。母亲对这个解释很满意，于是拖着步子离开了。但是，这次短暂的交谈让家里其他成员意识到，格雷戈尔出人意料地还在家里。过了一会儿，父亲来到某扇侧门边轻轻地敲了敲，但用的是拳头。“格雷戈尔，格雷戈尔，”他喊道，“出什么事了？”片刻之后，他又用一种低沉的声音警告道：“格雷戈尔！格雷戈尔！”而妹妹也在另一扇侧门关切地问道：“格雷戈尔？你不舒服吗？你需要什么东西吗？”格雷戈尔向两边回答道：“我已经准备好了。”他小心翼翼地发音并拖长每个单词之间的停顿，竭力消除声音中的怪异。父亲回去吃他的早餐，但是他的妹妹仍低声说：“格雷戈尔，请开门，我求你。”然而，格雷戈尔不仅没有任何想开门的念头，反而还庆幸自己在旅行中养成了谨慎的好习惯——即使是在家里，晚上他也会把门都锁上。</td>
		<td class="en">He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.There was a cautious knock at the door near his head.“Gregor,” somebody called—it was his mother—“it’s quarter to seven.Didn’t you want to go somewhere?”That gentle voice!Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognized as the voice he had had before.As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not.Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.”The change in Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away.But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.“Gregor, Gregor,” he called, “what’s wrong?”And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice:  “Gregor! Gregor!”At the other side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor?Aren’t you well?Do you need anything?”Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now,” making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word.His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.”Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >首先，他希望不受到任何干扰，安静地起床、穿衣，最重要的是吃早饭。只有这样他才能考虑下一步将做什么，因为他很明白，躺在床上无法从思绪中得出任何明智的结论。他记得以前躺在床上的时侯，经常感觉到一阵轻微的疼痛，那可能是由于躺的姿势不正确所引起的。但是那种疼痛总是被证实为纯属幻想。他想知道，他今天的幻想该如何慢慢消除。他一点也没有怀疑过，声音的变化无非就是重感冒的前兆，这对旅行推销员来说只不过是一种职业病。</td>
		<td class="en">The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed.He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today.He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >扔掉被子是件轻而易举的事，他只需稍微起身，被子便自行滑落。但是接下来的事就有困难了，尤其是因为他的身体异常宽大。以前他会用胳膊和手将自己撑起，但现在取而代之的是那些不停朝各个方向乱摆的细腿，而它们又不在他的掌控之下。如果他想让其中的一条腿弯曲，那条腿总是会第一个伸直。就算如他所愿，那条腿弯曲了，而其他的腿就好像被释放了一样，费力地挥舞着。“这种事在床上可干不了，”格雷戈尔自言自语道，“不能再这么试下去了。”</td>
		<td class="en">It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves.But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control.If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully.“This is something that can’t be done in bed,” Gregor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >首先，他要做的就是让身体的下部离开床，但是他从来没有看到过下部，也无法想象它是什么样子。事实证明想要移动太难了，进展相当缓慢。最后，他像是极度疯狂了一样，使出浑身力气，只管将自己向前推。可是这时，他选错了方向，猛地一下撞到床柱子下端，而这剧烈的疼痛感让他意识到，现在身体的下部很可能就是最敏感的部位。</td>
		<td class="en">The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，他小心地将头转向一边，试着让身体的上部离开床。这点他很轻易就做到了，尽管身体很宽、很重，大部分的躯体最终还是沿着头部的方向慢慢移动了。可是，当他的头终于离开床，暴露在新鲜空气中时，他突然意识到如果让自己跌落下去，头部要是不受伤那简直就是奇迹。因此他不敢继续以同样的方式推着自己前进。而且，他无论如何也不能把自己撞昏过去；呆在床上总比失去意识强。</td>
		<td class="en">So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side.This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way.And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他花了同样大的力气回到先前的位置，但是当他躺在那里叹气，并再次看着他的腿时，它们挣扎得更厉害了。如果这一切是真的，他真是想不出什么办法让混乱的局面回归平静和秩序。他再次告诫自己不能躺在床上，最明智的做法是，不惜任何代价，想尽千方百计将自己从床上解放出来。不过，与此同时他也不忘提醒自己，与其草率下结论，远不如静下心来思考。在这种时刻，他往往会将眼睛投向窗外，尽可能清楚地往外看。但不幸的是，连窄窄的街道的另一边都被晨雾包裹了，这种风景并没给他带来丝毫自信或是雀跃。“已经七点了，”闹钟再次敲响时，他自言自语道，“都七点了，雾还是这么浓。”他静静地在那里多躺了一会儿，轻轻地呼吸，仿佛他在期待这种完全的沉静能将一切带回真实、自然的状态。</td>
		<td class="en">It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos.He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice.At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions.At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him.“Seven o’clock, already,” he said to himself when the clock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.”And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，他接着又想：“七点一刻的闹钟敲响之前，我无论如何也要彻底离开床。到时候，公司里会有人来访，并向我询问发生了什么事,因为他们不到七点就开工了。”于是，他开始动手，想将整个身体一下子都晃下床去。如果他成功地用这种方法掉下床，并始终抬着头，那么他就有可能避免把头碰伤。他的背好像很硬，即使跌到地毯上，应该也不会有什么事。他主要担心的是可能会制造出很大的噪音。就算这声音透过所有的门之后没有引起惊慌，也可能引起别人的不安。但是，这个险不得不冒。</td>
		<td class="en">But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.”And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time.If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm.But it was something that had to be risked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当格雷戈尔正卡在下床的途中——这种新方法如其说是在努力，还不如说是场游戏，他要做的只是来回摆动——他突然想到，要是有人来帮他一把，一切该是多么简单啊！恐怕来两个强壮的人——他的脑海里浮现出父亲和女仆——就已经绰绰有余了。他们只需用手臂从他背后的弓形处一推，让他离开床。因为负重，他们得弯下身子。之后，当他落向地板时，他们得耐心、谨慎——但愿那些细小的腿在那里能发挥点作用。可是，他真的应该请求帮助吗？何况所有的门还锁住了。尽管处境艰难，一想到这个念头，他就情不自禁地笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him.Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swung over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不一会儿，他就已经移动了很远，这让他不能摆动得太厉害，否则就难以保持平衡。还差十分钟就到八点，他必须迅速做出最后的决定。就在这个时候，公寓的门铃响了。“可能是有公司的人来了。”他暗自想道。他浑身呆滞，可是那些小细腿却越来越活跃，不停地挥舞着。有那么一会儿，一切都很平静。“他们不打算开门。”格雷戈尔满怀某种荒谬的希望，自言自语道。但是，接着，女仆就像往常一样迈着稳健的步伐走向门口，把门打开。只需听来访者打招呼的话语，格雷戈尔就知道是谁——公司主任亲自到访。为什么只有格雷戈尔一个人该为公司卖命呢？哪怕只犯一丁点错误，他们也会立刻怀疑他。难道所有的员工，他们所有的人，全都是废物？难道他们中就没有一个忠心耿耿、诚实可信的吗？难道没有人会像他这样，因为下不了床，早上没法在公司业务上花几个小时，良心上就极其过不去吗？就算询问确实很有必要，难道派一个实习生来询问不行吗？非得让主任亲自出马？非得告知整个无辜的家庭，这件事是如此蹊跷，以至于只有主任才值得信任，才有智慧将事情调查清楚？由于这些想法比任何恰当的决定更让他心烦意乱，他使出浑身解数将自己摇出床外。他落地时发出了“砰”的一声，但也不是什么巨大的声音。地毯在他跌落时起了一点缓冲作用。格雷戈尔的背部比想象中的更有弹性，这样声音就被掩盖了，不太明显。他不够小心，没有把头抬得足够高，因此跌下来的时候将它撞着了。他感到懊恼、疼痛，就把头转过去，在地毯上来回擦着。</td>
		<td class="en">After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.The time was now ten to eight and he would have to make a final decision very soon.Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.“That’ll be someone from work,” he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.For a moment everything remained quiet.“They’re not opening the door,” Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope.But then of course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.Gregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the chief clerk himself.Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming?Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business?Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it?And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swung himself with all his force out of the bed.There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise.His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable.He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有东西掉下来了。”主任在左边的房间里说。格雷戈尔猜想，今天在他身上发生的这种事是否也会在主任身上发生。你不得不承认确实有可能。但是，他听到主任穿着高高的、锃亮的皮靴，在隔壁房间踏着沉重的步子，就像是粗鲁地回应这个问题一样。在右边的房间里，格雷戈尔的妹妹低声向他报告：“格雷戈尔，主任来了。”“嗯，我知道了。”格雷戈尔自言自语道，但是他不敢说得太大，以免被妹妹听见。</td>
		<td class="en">“Something’s fallen down in there,” said the chief clerk in the room on the left.Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible.But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.From the room on his right, Gregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief clerk is here.”“Yes, I know,” said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“格雷戈尔，”现在父亲在左边房间里说，“主任来了，他想知道为什么你没坐早班火车离开。我们也不知道该跟他说什么。不管怎么说，他现在想跟你面谈。那么，请把房门打开吧！我相信他不会介意你的房间乱糟糟的。”随后，主任喊道：“早上好，萨姆沙先生！”“他不舒服，”正当父亲继续隔着门说话时，母亲对主任说，“他不舒服，请相信我。哪会有其他的原因能让格雷戈尔错过火车！这孩子一心只想着公事。他晚上从不出门，这都快让我气死了。他在镇上已经一周了，但每晚都呆在家里。他和我们一起坐在厨房里，只看看报纸或是研究火车时刻表。他的娱乐方式就是用圆锯制作东西。比方说，他只花两三个晚上就做好一个小木框，您一定会赞叹它有多么精致！那个木框就挂在他的房间里，格雷戈尔一打开门，您就能看到。不管怎么说，很高兴您能来这里。我们没法让格雷格尔打开门，他太固执了。我相信他是不舒服，今天早上他还说他还好的，但是他确实是不舒服。”“我马上就来。”格雷戈尔缓慢而谨慎地回答道。但是，此时他并没有移动，这样就不会漏掉他们交谈时说的每一句话。“萨姆沙太太，我实在想不出其他的方法来解释这件事。”主任说道，“我希望这件事并不严重。但是，从另一方面来说，不管您认为这是幸运也好，是不幸也罢，我只能说，做生意的人哪怕是有一丁点不舒服，考虑到生意，也得自己硬撑着。”“现在主任可以进来看你吗？”父亲再次敲响了门，不耐烦地问道。“不能。”格雷戈尔回答道。他右边的房间陷入了令人痛苦的沉寂之中；左边的房间开始传来了妹妹的哭声。</td>
		<td class="en">“Gregor,” said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the early train.We don’t know what to say to him.And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally.So please open up this door.I’m sure he’ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.”Then the chief clerk called:“Good morning, Mr. Samsa.”“He isn’t well,” said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door.“He isn’t well, please believe me.Why else would Gregor have missed a train!The lad only ever thinks about the business.It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables.His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw.He’s made a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door.Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn’t.”“I’ll be there in a moment,” said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation.“Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining it, Mrs. Samsa,” said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.”“Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?” asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again.“No,” said Gregor.In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为什么妹妹不加入其他人中呢？她可能是刚刚起床，甚至还没开始穿衣服。可是为什么她要哭泣呢？是因为他没起床，没让主任进来？还是因为他正面临着被炒鱿鱼的危险？还是因为如果被炒，老板又会故技重施，向他们的父母追讨债务？其实，现在还没必要担心这种事。格雷戈尔仍旧在那里，压根就没有想过抛弃自己家庭。此时他正躺在地毯上。只要了解他处境的人，都不会苛求他会让主任进来。这只不过是一个微不足道的失礼行为，以后很容易就找到一个合乎情理的理由来解释。格雷戈尔也不会因为这点事就被当场解雇。对格雷戈尔而言，与其通过谈话或是哭泣来打扰他，还不如让他一个人静一会儿，这似乎更加明智。但是其他人并不知道发生了什么事，他们都很担心——这倒让他们的举止变得情有可原。</td>
		<td class="en">So why did his sister not go and join the others?She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.And why was she crying?Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before?There was no need to worry about things like that yet.Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.For the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying.But the others didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behavior.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >主任提高了音量。“萨姆沙先生，”他喊道，“你怎么了？你把自己关在房间里，对我们的回答只有是或不是，你毫无必要地给你的父母造成了很严重的担忧。而且你不去——我只是顺便提下——你以一种闻所未闻的方式不去履行你的工作义务。我谨代表你的父母和老板跟你讲话，郑重要求你立刻给出一个清晰的解释。我感到震惊，非常之震惊。我一直觉得你是一个沉着、明智的人，但是现在你好像突然表现得太过随性。今天早上，对于你今天没到这件事，老板确实想到了一个可能的理由。没错，这可能是与最近交托给你的那笔钱有关——但是我在他面前为你做了担保，事情绝不是那样的。但是，现在我是见识了你那不可理喻的固执劲，无论如何，我再也不想替你说情。你的职位也不会那么保险。我原本想私下跟你说这些，但是既然你让我在此无来由地浪费时间，那我也没什么理由瞒着你父母。你近期的营业额很不尽人意。我知道现在不是一年里做大买卖的旺季，这点我承认，但是也不是什么生意都没法做。萨姆沙先生，我们绝不允许这种事发生。”</td>
		<td class="en">The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa,” he called to him, “what is wrong?You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the way—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of.I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation.I am astonished, quite astonished.I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him my word of honor that that could not be the right explanation.But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf.And nor is your position all that secure.I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it.Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognize that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是，先生，”一激动格雷戈尔就忘了其他所有的事，他喊道，“我马上开门，请稍等。我感觉有点不舒服，一阵头晕，一直起不了床。现在我还在床上。不过，现在精神又好了。我正准备起床。马上就好。请耐心点！这并不像我想得那么容易。不过，现在我很好。真是让人震惊，怎么突然就发生了这种事！我昨晚上还好好的，我父母知道，或许比我知道得更清楚，其实昨晚上就已经有轻微的症状。他们肯定已经觉察到了。我不知道为什么工作时没向您报告！但是人总觉得不用呆在家里病就可以痊愈。请不要让我父母难受了！您的那些控诉毫无根据。关于这些事，没人跟我提过一个字。您可能没看过我最近交上去的合约书。我将搭乘八点的火车出发，还有，这几个小时的休息已经让我恢复了体力。先生，您不必等我。我随后就去办公室，麻烦您好心地转告老板，并且替我说点好话吧！”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格雷戈尔一边滔滔不绝地说着这些话——他几乎都不知道自己说了什么——一边向五斗橱方向爬去——可能是因为在床上已经练习过，他很容易就到了橱柜那儿——并试着让自己直立起来。他确实很想打开门，很想让他们看看他，很想跟主任谈谈。那些人的心情是如此的迫切，而他也急于想知道当他们看到他时会说些什么。如果他们感到震惊，那就不再是格雷戈尔的责任了，而他就能休息了。但是，如果他们很镇定地接受这一切，他就没理由继续萎靡下去。如果他抓紧时间，八点钟应该能赶到车站。开始几次，他试着爬上光滑的五斗橱，结果一次又一次地滑落下来。终于，他完成了最后一次摆动，直立了起来。身体下部传来一阵剧痛，但他已毫不在意。现在他让自己背靠着附近一把椅子的椅背，并用他那些小细腿紧紧地夹住椅子边缘。此刻，他已经平静下来，保持安静，这样就可以听到主任在说什么。</td>
		<td class="en">And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probably because of the practice he had already had in bed—where he now tried to get himself upright.He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o’clock.The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it.Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs.By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们听懂他说什么了吗？”主任问他的父母，“他应该不是在耍我们吧。”“噢，上帝啊！”母亲泪流满面，喊道，“他可能患了重病，而我们却让他遭受痛苦。格蕾特！格蕾特！”她接着喊道。“妈妈？”妹妹从另一边喊道。他们隔着格雷戈尔的房间交流。“你必须立刻去找医生。格雷戈尔生病了。快点，去找医生。你听到格雷戈尔刚才说话的方式了吗？”“那是动物的声音。”主任说道，与母亲的尖叫相反，他显得很平静。“安娜！安娜！”父亲从门厅走到厨房，他拍着手，“赶快找个锁匠来！”两个女孩立刻跑出大厅，裙子发出窸窸窣窣的声音。她们拧开前门，出去了。妹妹怎么穿衣服这么快呢？没有传来关门的砰砰声，他们肯定是把门开着；通常家里发生什么糟糕的事情时，人们就会这么做。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his parents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”.“Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer.Grete! Grete!” she then cried.“Mother?” his sister called from the other side.They communicated across Gregor’s room.“You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away.Gregor is ill.Quick, get the doctor.Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?”“That was the voice of an animal,” said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams.“Anna! Anna!” his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a locksmith here, now!”And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went.How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly?There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >和他们相反，格雷戈尔变得更加平静了。所以，他们再也没法听懂他的话。但是，他们的声音对他来说却是相当清楚，甚至比以前听得更清楚——也许他的耳朵已经习惯了这种声音。不过，他们已经意识到他出了事，并准备给他提供帮助。面对这种情况，他们的的第一反应很沉着、睿智，这使他感觉好多了。他觉得自己被拉回了人群中，尽管无法辨认哪个是医生，哪个是锁匠，他还是期待他们能取得伟大而惊人的成就。接下来无论说了什么都至关重要，因此，为了让自己的声音尽可能清晰，他轻轻地咳嗽了一声，但又很小心地让声音显得不太响亮。因为即使是轻声的咳嗽，也很容易让人听出它与人类咳嗽声的差别，而他自己已经无法对此作出判断了。与此同时，隔壁的房间变得非常安静。也许父母正坐在桌子旁边与主任低声耳语，或者他们全都双耳紧贴房门，正在窃听。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.So they couldn’t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.They had realized, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help.The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better.He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not really distinguish one from the other.Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself.Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room.Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格雷戈尔推着椅子，慢慢向门口移去。一到门口，他就丢开椅子，扑到门上，利用腿尖端的粘性抓着门，好让自己能直立地站着。他休息了一小会儿，让自己恢复体力，接着他开始试图用嘴巴拧动插在锁孔里的钥匙。不幸的是，他似乎没有真正意义上的牙齿——该如何抓紧钥匙呢？——但是，强有力的下颌当然可以弥补没有牙齿的缺陷。他确实可以用下颌扭动钥匙，不去管这样做必定会造成的一些伤害：棕色的液体从嘴里流出来，溢满钥匙，滴落在地板上。“听着，”主任在隔壁房间里说道，“他正在拧钥匙。”这让格雷戈尔倍受鼓舞，但是他们本该一直大声地对着他喊，包括他的父亲和母亲：“格雷戈尔，干得好！”他们本该喊道：“顶住，抓紧锁！”一想到自己的努力让他们都感到振奋，格雷戈尔就竭尽全力咬住钥匙，丝毫不在意这一行为给他带来的疼痛。钥匙转动，锁也随之而转动。他仅靠嘴巴让自己保持直立，他紧紧咬住钥匙，或是根据需要集中全身重量将钥匙往下推。锁反弹了回来，发出清脆的响声，这表明格雷戈尔可以放松一下了。他喘了一口气，对自己说：“看来，我根本就不需要锁匠。”接着，他把头靠在门把手上，将门完全打开。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs.He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth.He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.“Listen,” said the chief clerk in the next room, “he’s turning the key.”Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: “Well done, Gregor,” they should have cried, “keep at it, keep hold of the lock!”And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself.As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed.The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the locksmith after all”.Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他只能用这种方法才能打开门，因此门完全打开的时候，他们并没有看见他。首先他得让自己慢慢地从双扇门中的一扇的背面转过来，如果他不想在进房间时摔得四脚朝天，就得小心翼翼地转过去。他依然专注于这个高难度的动作，没法注意其他东西。这时，他听到了主任一声响亮的惊叫“啊！”听起来像是飕飕的风声。此时，他也看见了主任——主任离门最近——他用手按住张大的嘴巴，缓慢地后退，仿佛被一股稳定、无形的力量所驱赶。格雷戈尔的母亲看着他的父亲，尽管主任在场，她的头发还是像刚起床那样蓬乱。接着，她张开双臂，向前朝格雷戈尔走了两步，瘫倒在她那向地板四散开来的裙子上。她的头垂落到胸前，几乎看不见。父亲看起来充满了敌意，紧握拳头，好像是想将格雷戈尔打回他的房间。随后，他很不确定地环顾客厅四周，用双手捂着眼睛哭泣，他那强有力的胸膛也因此而颤抖。</td>
		<td class="en">Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen.He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room.He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!” which sounded like the soughing of the wind.Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.Gregor’s mother, her hair still disheveled from bed despite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his father.Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast.His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此格雷戈尔并没有走进房间，只是倚着另一扇门的内侧，这扇门仍然好好地锁着。这样就只能看到他一半的身子和上半只脑袋。他歪着身子，窥视着他们。此时，天色亮了很多。街道对面那座庞大的、灰黑色环状建筑物的一部分——那是医院——能看得清清楚楚，透过一排简陋的、整齐的窗户可以看到医院的正面。雨一直下个不停，大颗的雨点一滴滴坠下，敲打着地面。早饭时用过餐具还放在餐桌上，数量很多，因为格雷戈尔的父亲认为，早餐是一天中最重要的一顿饭。在用餐时他要看很多种不同的报纸，因此早餐时间甚至会延长至几个小时。餐桌正对面的墙上挂着格雷戈尔的照片，那时他在军队里是中尉。照片里的他手中握剑，脸上挂着无忧无虑的笑容，他的制服和风度让人肃然起敬。通向门廊的门是敞开的，由于公寓的前门也开着，他可以看到楼梯平台和朝下走时用的楼梯。</td>
		<td class="en">So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its facade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time.The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers.On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing.The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，现在，”格雷戈尔说，他很清醒地意识到，自己是唯一保持镇静的人，“我立刻穿上衣服，打包好样品，马上出发。你们能让我走吗？您很清楚，”他对主任说，“我并不固执，我喜欢我的工作。做一名旅行推销员很艰难，但是如果不四处奔波，我就没法谋生。您要去哪儿，回办公室吗？是吗？您会如实汇报一切吗？一个人暂时无法工作是完全有可能的，但这正好是回顾他过去取得的成就，思考他以后将创造的业绩的大好时机。一旦困难得到解决，他肯定会加倍勤奋，更加专注地工作。您很清楚，我欠了我们老板大笔债务，而且还得照顾我的父母和妹妹，因此我已经陷入了困境，但是我会再次找到解决问题的办法。请您不要给我难上加难，也不要在办公室为难我。我知道没人喜欢旅行推销员。他们认为我们不仅赚了大钱，而且工作时间自由。这只不过是偏见，但是他们又没有任何特别的理由不这么想。但是您，先生，比起其他员工，您对此有更深刻的见解。事实上，我可以在私底下说，对此您比老板的见解更深刻——像他那样的商人很容易对员工产生误解，并且用更加苛刻的标准来判断他们。您也非常清楚，我们旅行推销员几乎全年都不在办公室，因此很容易沦为流言蜚语、突发事件以及无端抱怨的受害者。然而，对于这种事情，我们没法为自己辩护，因为这些事我们听都没听说过。只有当我们筋疲力尽地结束旅行回来时，才知道一直发生的事情产生的不良影响，甚至连这些事究竟因何而起都不知道。请您不要离开，我所说的话总该有些是对的吧，您至少得说点什么，以表明您对此赞同吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, then,” said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and set off.Will you please just let me leave?You can see,” he said to the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and like I like to do my job; being a commercial traveler is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t earn my living.So where are you going, in to the office?Yes?Will you report everything accurately, then?It’s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration.You’re well aware that I’m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it again.Please don’t make things any harder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at the office.I know that nobody likes the travelers.They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.That’s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better it.But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should.And you’re also well aware that we travelers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going on without even knowing what caused them.Please, don’t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least partly right!”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格雷戈尔意识到，决不能让主任在这种情绪下离开，除非他想让自己在公司的地位陷入极度的危险之中。父母并不理解这件事情。这些年来，他们深信格雷戈尔一生都会干这份工作。此外，他们目前需要担心的事情太多了，没有闲暇考虑将来的问题。但是，格雷戈尔确实想到了未来。必须得阻止主任，让他平静下来，说服他，并最终赢得他的支持。格雷戈尔和全家的未来就全靠这一点了！要是妹妹在这儿该多好啊！她很聪明。当格雷戈尔还静静地仰卧着的时候，她就已经泪流满面。主任很喜欢女人，她一定可以说服他。她应该关上门廊处的大门，跟他交谈，让他摆脱震惊的状态。但是妹妹不在这里，格雷戈尔得亲自出马。格雷戈尔没有考虑到自己在现在这种状况下活动方便是否方便，也没想过他的话语仍然不能——可能再也不能——被人听懂。他放开门，使自己挤过通道，试图直达主任所在的楼梯平台。而主任正滑稽地用双手握着楼梯扶手。可是，格雷戈尔马上就栽了跟头——他摸索着想抓住某个东西，并发出了低低的尖叫声——他那许许多多细小的腿着地了。甫一着地，他便第一次感到身体舒服了，这在那天还是第一次。这些细小的腿稳稳地踏在坚实的地板上。令他欣慰的是，它们完全听从他的指挥，他想去哪，它们就竭尽全力带他去哪。于是他相信所有的不幸最终都会消失。他蜷在地板上，左右摇摆着，压抑住想要移动的冲动。母亲在前面离他不远处，起初她像是完全呆住了；不过接着她突然跳起来，伸展胳膊，张开手指，大叫道：“救命，我的天啊，救命！”她低头的样子表明她想更加清楚地看看格雷戈尔，但她下意识地拼命后退又表明她根本就不想。她忘了她身后的餐桌上还放着早餐时用过的餐具。到了桌子边，她毫无意识地迅速坐在了上面。她甚至好像没注意到咖啡壶被打翻了，咖啡洒了出来，泼在地毯上。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor realized that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.That was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future.Gregor, though, did think about the future.The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it!If only his sister were here!She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state.But his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself.And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or probably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end.He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor.His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for pity’s sake, Help!”The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“妈妈，妈妈！”格雷戈尔抬头看着她，温柔地说。此刻他将主任完全抛在了脑后，但是看着流淌的咖啡，他禁不住凭空咬动起下颌。这一举动让母亲再次尖叫，她从桌边逃开，扑向朝她飞奔而来的父亲的怀里。但是，现在格雷戈尔没时间顾及他的父母，主任已经到了楼梯边——他把下巴搁在扶手上，回头看了最后一眼。格雷戈尔朝他跑去，希望能赶上他。可是主任已经察觉，三步并作两步地跳下楼去，消失了，他的叫喊声在楼道间回响。不幸的是，主任的逃离让格雷戈尔的父亲也陷入了恐慌之中。之前，他还能勉强控制住自己；但是现在，就算他自己不去追主任，至少也不应该妨碍正在后面追的格雷戈尔。格雷戈尔的父亲用右手抓住主任的手杖（主任将手杖放在椅子后面忘了拿，帽子和大衣也一并忘了），左手从桌子上捡起一张较大的报纸，将格雷戈尔往房间里赶，还边走边朝他跺脚。格雷戈尔向父亲苦苦哀求，但是无济于事，因为他的哀求没人懂。可是，当他顺从地扭过头去时，父亲的脚却跺得更凶了。房间那边，格雷戈尔的母亲不顾阴冷的天气打开了一扇窗户，并将大半个身子探了出去，用手捂着脸。一阵气流从街道吹向楼梯，窗帘被飞扬起来，桌上的报纸也飘动着，有些还被吹落到地板上。没有什么能阻止父亲驱赶格雷戈尔，他像个野人一样对着格雷戈尔发出嘶嘶声。因为从没练习过后退，格雷戈尔只能非常缓慢地往后退。如果可以转头，格雷戈尔就会直接回自己的房间，但是这么做要花点时间，他担心父亲可能会随时失去耐心，用手中的手杖给他的背部或头部以致命一击。可是最后，格雷戈尔意识到他别无选择，因为他根本没办法直线后退，这让他很厌烦。因此，他频繁而焦急盯着父亲，尽可能快地让自己转过身去。一切进展得很慢，但是或许父亲发觉了他的好意，并没有妨碍格雷戈尔。事实上，他不时地用手杖的顶端从远处指明该往哪个方向走。要是父亲不发出那种让人难以忍受的嘶嘶声该多好！这让格雷戈尔感到很困惑。在他差不多快要转过身时，仍然可以听到那种嘶嘶声，他犯了一个错，又往回拐了一点。当他的头终于到了门口时，他感到很高兴。但是接着他就发现门口太窄，而他的身体太宽，要想进去还得进一步克服困难。很明显，以父亲目前的心情，他不会打开双扇门中的另一扇门来给格雷戈尔提供足够的空间，让他进去。他心里只想着一个念头——尽快将格雷戈尔赶回到房间。他也没想过给格雷戈尔足够的时间直起身来，好让他做好穿过门口的准备。父亲所做的是，制造更多的噪音驱赶格雷戈尔更加努力地前进，好像根本没有任何前进的阻碍。对于格雷戈尔来说，这声音听起来就像不止一个父亲在他身后。这种经历真是让人难受，格雷戈尔赶紧挤进门里，不去想可能会发生的事情。他所在的位置并不正对着门口，而是与门口有个夹角，他身体的一侧自觉地抬了起来，一侧的腹部擦到了白色的门上，受到严重的创伤，在门上留下了恶心的棕色斑点。不一会儿，他被牢牢地卡住了，根本就不能动弹。一侧细小的脚在空中颤抖着，另一侧则痛苦地紧贴着地面。这时，父亲从后面给了他沉重的一击。这一击将他从困境中解救了出来，他飞了起来，跌落在房间深处，流了很多血。接着，手杖“砰”的一声将门关上了。终于，一切都恢复了平静。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mother, mother,” said Gregor gently, looking up at her.He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee.That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time.Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well.Until then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went.Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face.A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man.Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly.If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father’s hand any moment.Eventually, though, Gregor realized that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round.It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn.If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing!It was making Gregor quite confused.When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come.He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through.He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible.Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen.One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground.Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room.The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep.He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him.The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark.He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been happening there.The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs.One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >直到门口，他才意识到确实是有某样东西将他吸引至此，那是食物的香味。门边有一个碟子，碟子里装满了加糖的牛奶，牛奶上漂着几小片白面包。他高兴得几乎要大笑起来，因为他比早晨时候更加饥饿。他立刻将头浸入牛奶中，眼睛几乎被牛奶给淹没了。但是，很快他又失望地将头缩了回来。不仅是因为他那脆弱的左侧非常疼痛，使得他吃起东西来很困难——除非整个身体像一个鼻孔出气那样合作，他才能吃东西——更何况牛奶味道也不是很好。通常来说，这种牛奶是他的最爱，肯定是妹妹特地为他留下的。可是，他极不情愿地转身离开了食物，爬回房间的中央。</td>
		<td class="en">It was only when he had reached the door that he realized what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat.By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it.But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all nice.Milk like this was normally his favorite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >透过门缝，格雷戈尔看到客厅里的煤气灯正亮着。通常，在这个时候，父亲会拿着晚报坐着，大声地读给母亲听，有时也给妹妹读。不过此刻却听不到这种声音。格雷戈尔的妹妹会经常写信告诉他读报的事，不过也许父亲最近放弃了这种习惯。尽管四周也是如此寂静，但公寓里肯定有人。“全家过着多么平静的生活啊！”格雷戈尔心想。他凝视着黑暗，想到能让父母和妹妹拥有这么幸福的家庭，过上如此的生活，就感到非常自豪。但是，如果现在所有的平静、财富以及舒适都将走向糟糕的、令人恐惧的结局，那该怎么办呢？这是格雷戈尔不愿过多思考的事。于是，他在房间里爬上爬下,四处移动。</td>
		<td class="en">Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room.His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard.Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times.It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat.“What a quiet life it is the family lead,” said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents.But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end?That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个漫长的夜晚中，房间一边的门被轻轻地打开过一次，接着又被匆匆地关上，随后另一边的那扇门也如此。似乎有人要进房间，但是经过深思熟虑后打消了这种念头。格雷戈尔立刻到门边去守候，下定决心要么将这个胆怯的来访者领进房间，要么至少弄清究竟是谁。但是那天晚上门再也没打开过，格雷戈尔白等了。前一天早晨门还锁着的时候，每个人都想进来看他。但是现在，他已经打开了一扇门，很明显另一扇门白天的某个时候也被打开了，但没人来，而开门的钥匙都在门的另一侧。</td>
		<td class="en">Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it.Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain.The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >客厅的煤气灯直到深夜才熄灭。此刻可以很容易地发现父母和妹妹一直都醒着，因为他们踮着脚一起离开的声音清晰可闻。很明显，除非到了早上，没人会去格雷戈尔的房间。这给了他充足的时间，能在不受任何干扰的情况下来思考如何重新安排以后的生活。不知为何，当他被迫留在屋里，平躺在地板上时，哪怕已经在这个高大而空旷的房间住了五年，他仍然感到很不自在。他慌慌张张地钻到睡椅下面，除了心底有一丝轻微的羞耻感外，根本不知道自己现在正在做什么。他感到背部被压下去了一点点，再也无法抬起头来。即便如此，他还是立刻感到很舒服，唯一遗憾的是身体太宽，无法完全钻进睡椅下面。</td>
		<td class="en">It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe.It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had been living in it for five years.Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch.It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He spent the whole night there.Some of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快，格雷戈尔就有机会来检验已做好的决定的效果。第二天清早，大约是拂晓时分，妹妹差不多已经穿戴整齐，从客厅打开门，焦急地向里看。她没有立刻看见他，但是当她发现他在睡椅下面时——他一定在某个地方，发发慈悲吧，他不可能飞走——她感到如此震惊，以至于无法控制自己，“啪”的一声从外边将门再次关上。但是她似乎为自己的行为感到后悔，立刻又将门打开，踮起脚尖走进来，好像是进入一个身患重病的人，甚至是一个陌生人的房间。格雷戈尔将头部向前推，正好推到睡椅的一边，看着她。她有没有注意到牛奶就放在原地，原封未动，并意识到这并不是因为他不够饿？她有没有给他带来其他更适宜的食物？如果她没有亲自这么做，他宁愿挨饿也不会提醒她。尽管他现在有种巨大的冲动，想从睡椅下钻出来，冲到妹妹脚边，乞求她给点好吃的东西。但是，妹妹立刻发现碟子仍是满满的，并大吃一惊地看着碟子以及周围溅出的几点牛奶。她立刻捡起碟子——不是徒手捡起，而是用破布——将它带走。格雷戈尔极其好奇，想知道她将会拿什么东西来替代。他想象着各种各样的可能性，但是他绝对不可能猜到他那善良的妹妹究竟会给他带来什么。为了测试他的口味，她给他带来了大量可供挑选的食物，将它们全部摊在旧报纸上。有半腐烂的老蔬菜、晚餐吃剩的骨头（骨头上覆盖着已经变硬的白色汤汁）、少量的葡萄干和杏仁、一些奶酪（格雷戈尔两天前就说这些奶酪已经变质了）、一块干面包卷和一些撒了盐的黄油面包。除了这些，她还往碟子里倒了些水——那只碟子一直放在那边，是给格雷戈尔用的——并将碟子放在食物旁边。接着，考虑到格雷戈尔的感受——她知道格雷格尔不愿当着她的面吃东西。就匆匆忙忙地离开房间，甚至用钥匙将门锁上，这样格雷戈尔就知道他可以随心所欲地尽情用餐了。格雷戈尔那些细小的腿手舞足蹈起来，他终于可以吃到东西了。不仅如此，他的伤口也应该已经完全愈合了，因为他发现自己可以不费吹灰之力地移动了。这令他感到很惊奇，因为一个多月前，他的手指被刀子轻微割伤了，前天他还在想为什么手指还会疼。“难道是我没有以前敏感了？”他边想边贪婪地吸食着奶酪。与报纸上的其他食物相比，奶酪立刻对他产生了无法抗拒的吸引力。他的双眼因满足而噙满泪水，他迅速地依次吃完奶酪、蔬菜和果酱。但是，他根本就不喜欢新鲜食物。因为无法忍受它们的味道，他甚至将自己喜欢的食物拖走，在远点的地方吃。过了好久，他吃完东西，懒洋洋地躺在原来的地方。妹妹慢慢地拧钥匙，仿佛在暗示他该离席了。尽管已经处于半睡着的状态，他还是立刻被惊醒了，赶紧钻到睡椅下面。哪怕妹妹只进来一小会儿，他也需要极大的自制力让自己呆在那里。因为吃了太多东西，身体变得有些圆胖，窝在那么狭窄的空间里，他几乎无法呼吸。他感觉有些窒息，用肿胀的眼睛盯着妹妹。只见她很自然地拿起扫把，打扫剩菜，将它们与他压根没碰过的食物混合在一起，似乎那些不能用了似的。她快速将全部食物倒进垃圾篓，盖上木盖子，把东西全部拿走了。她刚转身，格雷戈尔就从睡椅下钻了出来，舒展身体。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in.She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake, he couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside.But she seemed to regret her behavior, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her.Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realize that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable?If she didn’t do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something good to eat.However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise.She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare hands—and carried it out.Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring.In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper.There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt.As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor’s use, and placed it beside them.Then, out of consideration for Gregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked.Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat.What’s more, his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving.This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.“Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?” he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper.Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn’t stand the smell.Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch.But he needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space.Half suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每天，格雷戈尔就通过这种方式获得食物。第一次是早上，那时候父母和女仆还在睡梦中；第二次是中午所有人都吃完午饭后，父母要小睡一会儿，此时妹妹会让女仆做点差事，把她支开。当然，格雷戈尔的父母也不想让他挨饿，不过比起忍受亲自给他喂食，他们或许更愿意听妹妹讲述给他喂食的经历。也或许是因为他们确实已经遭受了太多苦难，因而妹妹愿意尽可能地帮父母分担一些。</td>
		<td class="en">This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send the maid away on some errand.Gregor’s father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat.As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room.It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly.“He’s enjoyed his dinner today,” she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s just been left there again.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Although Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen too much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it.There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret.For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without delay.It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，格雷戈尔的妹妹也得帮助母亲做饭。但是那也不太麻烦，因为大家都吃得不多。格雷戈尔经常听到他们中的某个人催促其他人吃饭，但都以失败告终。除了“不，谢谢，我已经饱了”或是其他类似的话语，再也没有得到任何答复。也没有人喝很多酒。妹妹有时会问父亲是否想要点啤酒，希望有机会能亲自离开房间去取酒。如果父亲一言不发时，她就接着说可以让管家去取酒，这样父亲就不会感觉到孤独。但是，父亲接着会大声而响亮地说“不”，整件事情就此结束，彼此无话。</td>
		<td class="en">Now Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or something similar.No-one drank very much either.His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself.When his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with a big, loud “No,” and no more would be said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >甚至在第一天还没结束时，父亲就向母亲和妹妹解释了他们的财政状况和前景。他不时地从桌边起身，并从小钱箱里取出某些收据或是文件。五年前他的公司倒闭的时候，他保住了这个小钱箱。格雷戈尔能听见父亲是如何打开那个复杂的锁，拿出他需要的东西后，又将它锁上的。自从他首次被囚禁在自己的房间里以来，父亲所说的话是他听到的第一个好消息。他以前认为父亲的生意中什么都没留下，至少父亲从来都是这么告诉他的。不管怎么说，格雷戈尔也从没向父亲询问过这件事。他们生意上的噩运让全家陷入了彻底的绝望之中。那时，格雷戈尔唯一关心的就是安排好所有事情，好让全家人能够尽快忘掉一切。因此从那以后，他激情似火，开始异常努力地工作，几乎在一夜之间就从初级推销员晋升为旅行推销员，同时也带来了通过不同方式挣钱的机会。格雷戈尔将工作上的成功直接转化为现金，回到家里，将这些钱摆在桌子上，赢得了全家人的惊奇和高兴。他们曾有过美好的时光，但是都已一去不返了，至少再也不会出现同样的辉煌。哪怕后来格雷戈尔挣了够多的钱足以承担全家的花销，而且他也承担了这些。格雷戈尔和家人都已对此习以为常。他们怀着感激之情拿钱，而他很乐意为他们提供钱，但是他们的回报中不再带有多少温情。格雷戈尔现在只有跟妹妹的关系依然亲密。与他不同，妹妹非常喜欢音乐，是一个很有天赋和表现力的小提琴手。他曾私下里盘算，明年送她去音乐学校，哪怕这会带来巨大的花销——这笔花销将会通过其他途径补足。在镇上短暂停留期间，格雷戈尔经常跟妹妹谈到音乐学校，但那从来只会被当做一个根本无法实现的美梦而提起。他们的父母不喜欢听这种幼稚的谈话，但是格雷戈尔非常认真地考虑过，并决定在圣诞节那天郑重宣布他的计划，让他们都知道。</td>
		<td class="en">Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier.Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted.What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room.He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible.So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigor that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways.Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family.They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendor, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them.They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.Gregor only remained close to his sister now.Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way.During Gregor’s short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realized.Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent.“What’s that he’s doing now,” his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在解释这些事情时，父亲多次重复自己的话。部分是因为他已经许久不考虑这些事情了，还有部分原因是格雷戈尔的母亲开始时并没有听懂。让格雷戈尔欣慰的是，他从父亲的重复解释中得知，尽管遭遇了这么多不幸，但是以前还是留下了些钱。虽然不是很多，但在此期间一直没动过，倒是积攒了一些利息。此外，格雷戈尔每个月都会给家里钱，自己只留一小部分。他们并没将钱全部花光，因此那也积攒了起来。格雷戈尔在门后面满心激动地点着头，为这种意想不到的节约和谨慎而高兴。事实上，他本可以用这些剩余的钱来减轻父亲欠老板的债务，这样他就可以早点摆脱这份工作。但是，现在看来，父亲处理事情的方式确实更胜一筹。</td>
		<td class="en">When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand everything first time.From these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days.It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more.That’s to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned.His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence.During the five years that he had not been working—the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy.Would Gregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money?She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.Would his sister have to go and earn money?She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin.Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible.In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her.Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual.It made him realize that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch.One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.She left the sheet where it was.Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him.He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her.But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it.Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully.Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!Can’t you understand I have to see him?” and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格雷戈尔想见母亲的愿望很快就实现了。考虑到他的父母，他不想让他们看见他白天在窗户边的情形。区区几平米的空间根本不够他爬来爬去，而整晚静静地躺着对他来说太难了，很快食物也不能给他带来任何快乐。于是，为了自娱自乐，他养成了在墙壁和天花板上爬上爬下的习惯。他特别喜欢挂在天花板上，这与在躺在地板上感觉迥异。他能够更加自如地呼吸，身体在上面轻轻地摇晃。在那儿他感觉很放松，也很开心。也可能会发生令他自己都觉得震惊的事——没抓住天花板，“砰”的一声掉在地板上。当然，他现在比以前能更好地控制自己的身体，哪怕是那么沉重地跌落，也不会给他造成任何伤害。很快，妹妹就发现格雷戈尔的新娱乐方式——他四处爬动时脚下免不了会留下一些粘糊糊的印迹——于是她脑海里有了一个念头：将挡道的家具移开，特别是五斗橱和桌子，好让他尽可能容易地爬行。但是，以她个人之力无法完成这件事，她又不敢请父亲帮忙。自从厨师离开后，那个年仅十六岁的女仆勇敢地留了下来，但是，她肯定不会帮这个忙。她甚至申请把厨房一直锁着，除非有特别重大的事情才开门。因此，妹妹别无选择，只能趁父亲不在家时，请母亲过来帮她。母亲朝房间走来时，格雷戈尔听见她在抒发喜悦之情，但是一到门口她就沉默不语。当然，妹妹先进来，四处查看房间里是否一切正常，接着才让母亲进来。格雷戈尔急忙将睡椅上的床单拉得更低了，并弄出更多褶皱，好让它看上去上像是随意扔在那儿的。这次，格雷戈尔也控制住自己不从床单下往外看。他放弃了见母亲的机会，仅仅只为母亲的到来而感到高兴。“您可以进来,看不见他了。”每每说道，显然她正牵着母亲的手领她进来。对两个柔弱的女人而言，这个旧五斗橱太重了，根本举不起来。格雷戈尔听见她们将五斗橱从原来的位置推开。妹妹总是承担最重的那份活，母亲告诫说这样做会受伤，她却毫不顾忌。这样过了好久。大约这样劳碌了一刻钟左右，母亲建议最好还是把五斗橱放在原处。一来，要搬的东西对她们来说太重了，父亲回来之前根本完不了工，把它放在房间中央可能会更加挡道；再者，就算把它搬走了，仍然不能确定是否真的对他有什么帮助。她的看法恰恰相反。看到光秃秃的墙壁，一阵悲伤就会直袭她的心脏。格雷戈尔会不会也有同感呢？长久以来，他已经习惯房间里的摆设，住在这样一个空荡荡的房间里，他可能会觉得自己被抛弃了。她笃信格雷戈尔听不懂自己的话。接着，她几乎是轻声耳语起来——仿佛连声调都不想被他（她不知道他在哪里）听见——接着说道：“搬走这些家具不像是再说，我们已经放弃了所有好转的希望，我们要抛弃他让他自生自灭吗？我认为最好还是让这个房间完全保持原样，这样等格雷戈尔恢复正常回到我们中间时，他将会发现一切都没变，将会更容易忘掉这段时间发生的一切。”</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realized.Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash.But now, of course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage.Very soon his sister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk.Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance.Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come.“You can come in, he can’t be seen,” said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand.The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would strain herself.This lasted a very long time.After laboring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him.She thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor feel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like we’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re abandoning him to cope for himself?I think it’d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the time in between all the easier”.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听了母亲的话,格雷戈尔意识到，这两个月来，自己缺乏与人类的直接交流,家人也都过着单调的生活，这些肯定让他变得糊涂了——否则他想不出别的理由来解释为何自己如此希望将房间腾空。这是一个温暖的房间，摆满了他继承下来的漂亮家具，难道他真想把这个房间变成一个洞穴？这样也许可以让他畅通无阻地四处爬动，但是也会让他很快忘掉过去，忘记他还是人的时候。他差不多已经淡忘了，只是当他再次听到母亲的声音——他好久都没听见了，才从遗忘中惊醒。什么都不必搬，一切必须保持原样。没了家具给他的状况带来的良好影响，他没法生存。就算在他漫无目的地四处爬行时，这些家具会给他造成困扰，那也是有百益而无一害。</td>
		<td class="en">Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realize that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited?That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human.He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不幸的是，妹妹不同意。她已经打定了主意，并且有她的理由——她是格雷戈尔的代言人，一切有关他的事情由她向父母转告的。也就是说，母亲的建议为她坚持搬走家具提供了充分的理由，不仅按她最初所想的搬走五斗橱和桌子，还要搬走其他所有的家具，只有最重要的睡椅除外。当然，让她坚持己见的这不仅仅是一种孩子般的固执，或是她最近获得的一种意想不到的自信。事实上，她确实注意到格雷戈尔四处爬动需要大量的空间，而且，正如大家所见，这些家具对他而言根本就没用。可是，那个年纪女孩们确实对事物充满了热情，总希望一切必须按照她们的意愿行事。也许正是这引诱着格蕾特将格雷戈尔推入比以前更加糟糕的处境，这样她就可以为他做更多事情。这个房间由格雷戈尔支配，他独自一人在光秃秃的墙壁上爬来爬去，而格蕾特可能是唯一一个敢进来的人。</td>
		<td class="en">His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him.This meant that his mother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch.It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can.Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him.Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">So she refused to let her mother dissuade her.Gregor’s mother already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had.The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it.He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch.His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch.In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little.It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格雷戈尔一再说服自己不会发生什么意外，只不过是搬动几件家具罢了。可是，那两个女人走来走去，轻声呼喊彼此，家具也在地板上蹭得直响，他很快就不得不承认这一切都让他觉得自己像是腹背受敌。他的头部和腿蜷缩在一起，身体贴着地板。他不得不承认，自己忍受不了多久了。她们正在清空他的房间，将格雷戈尔珍爱的东西都拿走。放圆锯和其他工具的橱柜早已被搬走。现在她们扬言要搬走写字台——写字台之下的地板早已清晰地凹了下去——以前在公司做实习生、上中学甚至是幼儿园时，他都在这个写字台上完成家庭作业——他真的再也等不下去了，迫切想弄清楚这两个女人到底是不是心怀好意。他几乎都忘了她们就在这里。因为太累，她们工作时一句话也没说，他只能听见她们双脚沉重地踩在地板上的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer.They were emptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women’s intentions were good.He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，当她们在隔壁靠着桌子喘气时，格雷戈尔突然爬了出来，改变了四次方向，因为他不知道首先该顾哪个方向。他突然看到了墙上的画——以前墙上挂的东西都已被取走——那张画着身穿裘皮大衣的贵妇的画作。他赶忙爬上照片，紧贴着玻璃。他牢牢地贴在玻璃上，滚烫的腹部在玻璃上感觉很舒服。此刻，这幅照片完全被格雷戈尔遮住，怎么说都不可能会有人将它拿走。他转过头正对着通往客厅的门，好在她们回来时能更好地观察她们。</td>
		<td class="en">So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly.This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one.He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们并没让自己休息多久，很快就回来了。格蕾特搂着母亲，几乎是在抬着她。“那么，我们现在该拿什么走呢？”格蕾特环顾四周，说道。她的目光与正在墙上的格雷戈尔的目光相遇了。也许是因为母亲在场，她还是很冷静，低下头对着母亲，这样她就不会四处张望。不过，她还是用颤抖的声音急忙说道：“走，我们回客厅片刻好吗？”格雷戈尔很清楚格蕾特在想什么，她想把母亲送到安全的地方，然后把他从墙上赶下来。是的，她肯定会那么做！他不屈不挠地坐在那幅画上。他宁愿跳到格蕾特的脸上去。</td>
		<td class="en">They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.“What shall we take now, then?” said Grete and looked around.Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: “Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?”Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall.Well, she could certainly try it!He sat unyielding on his picture.He would rather jump at Grete’s face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是格蕾特的话语让母亲感到非常担忧，她走到一边，看见墙纸的花案上有一个巨大的棕色斑块。她甚至还没认出来那就是格雷戈尔，就大声尖叫起来：“哦，天啊！哦，天啊！”她张开双臂，跌倒在睡椅上，仿佛已经万念俱灰，一动不动地呆在那里。“格雷戈尔！”妹妹挥舞着拳头愤怒地瞪着他，大声吼道。这是他变形以来妹妹直接对他说的第一句话。她跑到隔壁房间去取嗅盐，好让母亲从昏迷中醒来。格雷戈尔也想去帮忙——他可以晚点再抢救那幅画，可是他在玻璃上粘得太紧，必须费点力气才能脱落。随后，他也跑进隔壁房间，好像他可以如往常一样给妹妹一些建议那样。但是他什么也不能做，只能站在她身后。格蕾特正在瓶瓶罐罐中寻找嗅盐，当她转过身时，被格雷戈尔吓了一跳。一只瓶子掉在地板上，摔碎了。一块碎片划伤了格雷戈尔的脸，某种腐蚀性的药物溅了他一身。格蕾特一刻也不耽搁，一把抱住所有能抱住的瓶子跑回母亲那儿。她用脚一蹬，“砰”的一声关上了门。现在，格雷戈尔被关在母亲的房间外面。正是因为他，母亲才被吓得半死。他不能打开门，否则妹妹会被他吓跑，而她必须和母亲呆在一起。除了等待，他什么也不能做。他因焦虑和自责而深受折磨，开始在墙上、家具上和天花板上四处爬动。最后，在混乱中，整个房间开始在他的四周旋转，他跌落在餐桌中央。</td>
		<td class="en">But Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realized it was Gregor that she saw screamed: “Oh God, oh God!”Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.“Gregor!” shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation.She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut with her foot.So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他静静地在那躺了一会儿，麻木，一动也不动，他的周围很安静，也许这是一个好兆头。接着，有人敲门。当然，女仆早已将自己锁在厨房里，因此格蕾特必须去开门。父亲已经到家了。“发生了什么事？”这是他的第一句话。从格蕾特的表情中，他已经知道了一切。她公然将脸贴着他的胸膛，轻声地回答：“母亲昏倒了，不过现在好了些。格雷戈尔出来了。”“正如我所料，”父亲说，“正如我一直所说，但是你们母女俩都不听，是吧！”格雷戈尔很清楚，格蕾特并没有详细说明整件事，而父亲以为事态很严重，他有义务采取暴力措施。也就是说，现在格雷戈尔必须设法让父亲冷静下来，可是即使有这个可能，他也没时间向父亲解释一切。因此，他逃向自己房间的门口，贴在那儿。这样当父亲从走廊进来时，就可以立刻明白，格雷戈尔是心怀好意，会立刻回到自己的房间里。他们只消把门打开，不用驱赶，他就会消失。</td>
		<td class="en">He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign.Then there was someone at the door.The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it.His father had arrived home.“What’s happened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made everything clear to him.She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s better now.Gregor got out.”“Just as I expected,” said his father, “just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.”It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible.So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，父亲没心情关心这些细节，他一进门就喊道：“啊！”听起来像是喜怒交加。格雷戈尔将头从门边缩回，抬起头面对父亲。他确实从没想象过父亲站在这里的情形。最近，他养成了四处爬行的新习惯，不再像往常那样关注公寓其他地方发生了什么事情。的确，他应该早料到一切都已改变，但是，这真的还是，还是他的父亲吗？格雷戈尔结束商务旅行回家时，这个看起来疲惫不堪的男人总是躺着床上，将自己埋进被窝里。晚上，格雷戈尔回到家里，父亲会穿着睡衣坐在扶手椅上迎接他。即使没法站起来，他也会扬起手臂，表示他很高兴。每年总有几次，他们会在某个周末或是公共假日一起出去散步，父亲走在母亲和格雷戈尔中间，用大衣将自己紧紧地包裹着。他总会艰难地往前走，总是走得比他们稍微慢些——为了照顾他，他们已经走得相当慢。他小心翼翼地拄着拐杖，如果想要发言，他一定会停下来，将同伴召集到他的周围。现在，他正站得笔挺，穿着一套整齐的镶金纽扣的蓝色制服，这是金融机构员工穿的行头。他那结实的双下巴从又高又硬的外套衣领上露了出来。浓密的睫毛下面是一双敏锐的黑眼睛，看上去既神采奕奕又充满警惕。他的白发在平日里总是乱糟糟的，现在却梳到了后面，紧紧地贴着头皮。他脱下帽子，上面用金线绣着几个字母，那可能是某个银行的缩写。他将帽子抛了出去，扔到了房间对面的沙发上。他拉了拉长长的制服大衣的底部，将手插进裤子口袋里，带着坚毅的表情走向格雷戈尔。可能他连自己在想什么都不清楚，但是，他仍然将脚抬得相当之高。他靴子的尺码相当大，这让格雷戈尔感到震惊，但是不能因为这而浪费时间——从新生活开始的第一天起，他就很清楚父亲认为有必要一直对他极其严厉。于是，格雷戈尔跑向父亲。父亲停下来，他也停下来。只要父亲一移动，哪怕是稍微移动，他就马上向前急跑。就这样，他们在房间里兜了几次圈，但没有什么决定性的事情发生。一切进行得如此之慢，甚至都没人觉得这是一场追逐。格雷戈尔一直呆在地板上，这主要是因为他担心要是自己逃到墙上或天花板上，会让父亲觉得他在蓄意挑衅。格雷戈尔不得不承认，无论做什么，像这样跑下去，他肯定撑不了多久。父亲每走一步，他就得移动无数步。很明显，他的呼吸越来越急促。即使在变形之前的生活中，他的肺就不太顶用。现在，当他拼命蹒跚而行，用尽全身力气逃跑时，他很难让双眼一直睁开。他的思维变得太过迟钝，除了逃跑，再也想不出去其他方法自救。他几乎忘了还可以利用墙壁——虽然墙壁被表面坑坑洼洼的雕花家具所掩盖。这时，他旁边的某个东西被轻轻扔了起来，飞落下来，滚到他面前。那是个苹果，接着又一只苹果向他砸来。格雷戈尔惊呆了，既然父亲决定这样攻击他，继续逃跑也无济于事。父亲从餐具柜上的碗里取了些水果，将口袋全装满，根本没花时间仔细瞄准目标，就一个接一个地扔苹果。这些小小的红苹果在地板上滚来滚去，仿佛都装有电动机，彼此碰撞。一个没多大力道的苹果擦到了格雷戈尔的后背，滑落下来，但没有造成任何伤害。然而，紧接着又一只苹果扔了过来，正中他的后背。格雷戈尔想让自己移动，好像只要移动位置就能让这种出人意料的难以言表的疼痛消失一样。但是，他感觉自己像是被钉在了那里，趴在地上，思维完全陷入了混乱之中。他看到的最后一幕是，他房间的门被拉开了，妹妹正在尖叫，母亲从她面前穿着罩衫跑了出来（母亲晕倒后，妹妹给她脱了些衣服，这样呼吸起来就更加容易）。她跑向父亲，松开的裙子一件接一件滑落到地板上。她的脚被裙子绊住了，于是她扑向格雷戈尔的父亲，紧紧地搂着他——现在格雷戈尔什么也看不见——她的手环绕着父亲的头，乞求他饶了格雷戈尔的性命。</td>
		<td class="en">His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; “Ah!” he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time.Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father.He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labor his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him.He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp.He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor.He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him.And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly.In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly.Gregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling.Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable.Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him.It was an apple; then another one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another.These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors.An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid off without doing any harm.Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him totally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind his father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没人敢拿走卡在格雷戈尔肉里的那个苹果，因此它就一直卡在那儿，清晰可见地提醒着他受到的伤害。那只苹果卡在那儿，已经折磨了他一个多月了。他那糟糕的情形甚至让父亲想起，即使格雷戈尔现在的样子很糟糕，会令人作呕，但他也是这个家的一员，不应该被当成敌人对待。恰恰相反，作为一家人，就有义务默默忍受对他的厌恶之情，应该有耐心，只要有耐心就好了。</td>
		<td class="en">No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury.He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy.On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为受伤的缘故，格雷戈尔变得很笨拙——也许永远都要这么笨拙了。他陷入了老年残疾人的境地，要想爬过房间也得花好久好久——爬上天花板是根本不可能的——但是，（在他看来）这种不断恶化的状况已经完全得到了补偿：通往客厅的门每晚都开着。他养成了一种习惯——在门被打开前，花一两个小时来密切关注它。门被打开后，他躺在黑漆漆的房间里，客厅里的人根本看不见他，而他可以看见家人坐在餐桌的灯下，可以在所有人的默许下聆听他们的谈话，这与以前大不相同。</td>
		<td class="en">Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probably permanently.He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling over the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，他们的谈话不再像以前那么轻松愉快。每当格雷戈尔疲惫不堪，下榻在某个小旅馆，一头倒在潮湿的床上时，他总会怀着一丝渴望之情缅怀以前的谈话。现在，他们通常都很安静。晚饭后不久，父亲就躺在他的椅子上睡着了；母亲和妹妹会要求彼此保持安静。母亲腰弯得很低，在台灯下为一家时装店缝制别致的内衣。妹妹已经找到了一份售货员的工作，但她每天晚上学习速记和法语，以便日后能谋个更好的职位。父亲偶尔会醒来，对格雷戈尔的母亲说：“今天你又缝了这么多！”他似乎不知道自己刚刚正在打盹——接着，他便又睡了过去，母亲和妹妹则面带倦容地相视而笑。</td>
		<td class="en">They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on.Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again today!” as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >出于某种固执心理，即使在家里，格雷戈尔的父亲也不愿脱下制服，他的睡衣挂在衣钩上，丝毫派不上用场。格雷戈尔的父亲总能在原地睡着，穿戴得整整齐齐，像是在随时候命，期待听到上司的吩咐。这件制服一开始就不是新的，正因如此，它慢慢变得越来越破旧，就算母亲和妹妹费尽心思打理也无济于事。格雷戈尔经常会整晚盯着外套上的污迹看，衣服上的金色纽扣总是擦得铮亮。而这位老人穿着制服可能会睡得非常不舒服，但却很安详。</td>
		<td class="en">With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg. Gregor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here.The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor’s mother and sister to look after it.Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >十点钟的钟声一敲响，格雷戈尔的母亲就会温柔地叫醒父亲，试着劝说他上床睡觉。因为在原地他不可能睡好觉，况且他要想早上六点能起来上班，就必须睡好觉。可是，自从工作之后，他就变得越来越固执，总是坚持要在桌子边多呆一会儿。尽管他入睡很有规律，可是想要说服他从椅子上移到床上比以前更难了。此时，不管母亲和妹妹多么低声地斥责或是警告，软磨硬泡地要求他起身，他只会缓缓地摇十五分钟的头，紧闭双眼，拒绝起来。格雷戈尔的母亲揪着他的袖子，充满爱意地在他耳边低声细语。妹妹也放下手头的功课过来帮助母亲，但是根本不起作用。他反倒更深地陷进椅子里去了。直到这两个女人把他从腋下夹住时，他才会突然睁开眼睛，依次看着她们，说道：“这是什么生活啊！这就是我晚年所享受到的宁静？”在这两个女人的搀扶下，他可以小心翼翼地站起来，仿佛他正背负着最沉重的担子。他让女人们领他到门边，就让她们离开，自己继续走。但是母亲会放下手中的针线活，妹妹也放下她的笔，紧跟在父亲的后面，以便继续为他提供帮助。在这个劳累不堪、过度工作的家里，除非迫不得已，谁会有时间关心格雷戈尔呢？家里的经济变得更为拮据，女仆也被解雇了。一位高大健壮、满头飘着银发的杂活女工每天清早和晚上都会过来，干最繁重的活儿。其他一切家务由母亲来照料，首当其冲的是她所做的大量的缝纫活。晚上，格雷戈尔得知，家里的几件珠宝已经卖了——母亲和妹妹以前很喜欢戴着它们出席宴会和庆典。他甚至还听见他们在讨论原本期望卖出的价格。但是抱怨最多的是，虽然以他们目前的情况来说，这个公寓太大，但他们不能搬走，因为实在想不出什么办法可以将格雷戈尔转移到一个新地方。但是，他很清楚，除了考虑他以外，还有更多使他们搬迁受阻的原因。转移他应该是件相当容易的事情，随便一个板条箱，只要大小合适，带了几个透气孔，就能解决问题。但阻碍他们下定决心搬迁的主要问题还是与他们彻底的绝望以及这种想法有关——他们已经陷入不幸，任何熟人和亲戚都未经历过这种不幸。他们一点不差地做了这个世界期待穷人做的一切事情，父亲给银行的职员买早餐，母亲牺牲自己去给陌生人洗衣服，妹妹听从顾客的吩咐在柜台边跑来跑去，但是他们实在也没有力气做得更多了。格雷戈尔背部的伤口开始像新伤一样疼痛起来。将父亲扶上床后，格雷戈尔的母亲和妹妹就会放下手中的活儿，脸贴着脸，亲密地坐在一起。母亲指着格雷戈尔的房间说：“格蕾特，关上那扇门。”接着，他就再次处于黑暗之中，而她们则坐在隔壁房间里，泪水交织，或者仅仅只是坐在那里，无动于衷地盯着餐桌。</td>
		<td class="en">As soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed.Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.Gregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him.He would just sink deeper into his chair.Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What a life!This is what peace I get in my old age!”And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor’s mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary?The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did.Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations.But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to.They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more.And the injury in Gregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new.After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that door, Grete,” and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不管白天还是黑夜，格雷戈尔根本睡不着。有时，他会想，下次门打开时，他就可以像往常一样承担起家里的事务。他早已忘记了老板和主任，但此刻他们又浮现在他的脑海中。推销员、学徒、那个迟钝的仆役、其他行业的两三个朋友、某个外省旅社的女服务员、一些若隐若现的美好回忆、帽子店里的女出纳（他曾认真关注过她，可惜太迟了）——所有这些都出现在脑海中，同那些陌生人和被遗忘的人交织在一起，但是他们都遥不可及，无法给他和家人任何帮助。当这些回忆消失时，他感到很高兴。其他时候，他根本没心情去关心家人，他们给予他的关心太少，这让他心中充斥的都是愤怒。虽然他可能觉得自己什么都不需要，但他还是制定了一个如何进入食品储藏室的方案，就算自己不饿，也要去那里拿到所有自己应得的食物。妹妹也不再去想如何才能取悦他，只是在早上和中午赶去上班之前，将食物和其他东西匆忙踢进他的房间。晚上，她会用扫帚再次将它扫走，毫不关心食物是否已经吃完或是——大多数的时候——原封未动。她依然在晚上打扫房间，不过现在速度快得惊人。墙壁上有污点，到处是小球状的尘土和污物。起初，妹妹一进来，格雷戈尔就跑到最肮脏的一处地方，通过这种方式来指责她。但是即使他在那儿呆上几个星期，妹妹也不会采取任何行动。当然，和他一样，她也能把灰尘看得一清二楚。只是她已决定任其自生自灭。同时，她有了全新的发怒的理由，对此全家人都表示理解——毕竟负责清理格雷戈尔房间的只有她一个人。一次，格雷戈尔的母亲对他的房间进行了一次彻底的清扫，用了好几大桶水——但是房间太潮湿，害得格雷戈尔生病了。他痛苦地平躺在睡椅上，一动也不动。但是，母亲也因她的所作所为而受到了更多的处罚。妹妹晚上一回到家就发现格雷戈尔的房间发生了变化。她感到极度愤怒。任凭母亲举起双手恳求，她还是跑回了客厅，忍不住抽搐，掉下泪来。父亲自然也很震惊，他从椅子里站了起来。父母都看惊讶而无助地看向一旁。接着，他们也变得愤怒不已。父亲站在母亲右边，指责她应该将打扫房间的任务留给妹妹；妹妹在母亲左边大声嚷道，以后她再也不打扫格雷戈尔的房间了；而母亲正试图拉着在一边勃然大怒的父亲回卧室。妹妹正在抽泣，用她的小拳头敲打餐桌。格雷戈尔发出愤怒地嘶嘶声，甚至都没人想到要关上门，好让他看不到这一幕，听不到这些噪音。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.Sometimes he would think of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared.Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry.Gregor’s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or—more often than not—had been left totally untouched.She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it.Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth.At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.Gregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite her mother’s raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears.Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his sister; from her left, Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外出工作让格雷戈尔的妹妹感到疲惫不堪，像往常一样照顾格雷戈尔成了更为沉重的负担。但是，毫无疑问，即便如此，母亲也不应该取代她的位置。再说了，格雷戈尔也不应该被忽视。因此，现在请了杂活女工。她是一个上了年纪的寡妇，骨架硬朗，这也使得她能忍受一生中最艰难的事情：她确实不会被格雷戈尔吓倒。一天，仅仅是由于偶然而非好奇，她打开了格雷戈尔房间的门，发现格雷戈尔正与她面面相觑。他大吃一惊，虽然没人驱赶他，但他却开始匆忙地四处逃窜。此时，杂活女工只是双手叠在胸前，惊讶地站在那里。从此以后，每天早上和晚上，她都会轻轻地打开门，迅速地看他一眼。开始的时候，她会用一些自认为友好的话语跟格雷戈尔打招呼，比如说：“过来，蜣螂！”要么就是：“看看那只老蜣螂！”格雷戈尔从来不会对这种话予以回答，只是一动不动地呆在原地，仿佛门从未打开过。如果他们已经告诉这个杂活女工每天只用打扫房间，而不用随心所欲、无缘无故地骚扰他，那该多好啊！一天清晨，倾盆大雨击打着窗玻璃，似乎在预示着春天的到来，她又开始用那种语气同他讲话。格雷戈尔感到非常愤怒，开始朝她爬去。虽然他行动缓慢，步履蹒跚，但是看上去却像是一种攻击。不过杂活女工并不害怕，她只是举起门边的一张椅子，张大嘴巴，站在那里。很明显，除非她将手中的椅子使劲砸向格雷戈尔的后背，否则她并不打算闭上嘴巴。当格雷戈尔转过身去时，她平静地把椅子放回角落里。她问道：“你怎么不再靠近点啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.Now, though, the charwoman was here.This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really repelled by Gregor.Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face to face with him.He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her.From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on then, you old dung-beetle!” or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened.If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it!One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to speak to him in that way once again.Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack.Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back.“Aren’t you coming any closer, then?” she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格雷戈尔几乎已经不吃东西了。除非偶然发现自己就在为他准备好的食物旁边，他也许会衔点食物在嘴里玩玩，通常几个小时后，他又会将它吐出来。起初，他以为是房间的现状让他感到苦恼，导致他吃不下东西。但是，他很快就对这些变化习以为常。他们开始习惯于把没有地方搁置的东西放进这个房间。由于公寓中的一间屋子已经租给了三位绅士，这样的东西就变得多了起来。这些严肃的绅士们——格雷戈尔某天从门缝里偷窥，发现三人都留着络腮胡子——坚持要求一切保持干净整洁。也就是说，既然他们在这个住宅里租了一间房，不仅是他们自己的房间，整个公寓，尤其是厨房，都必须保持清洁。他们无法容忍不必要的杂物，特别是很脏的杂物。此外，他们将自己大部分的家具和设备都带了过来。正因如此，很多东西成了多余的——虽然它们卖不出去，但家人又不舍得扔掉。所有这样的东西都被一股脑地塞进了格雷戈尔的房间。厨房的垃圾篓也在这里找到了归宿。杂活女工总是匆匆忙忙，凡是暂时用不着的东西，她都往里扔。幸运的是，他通常只能看见这些东西以及拿着东西的手。那个女人很可能是打算以后如果有时间或有机会再把东西拿走或是干脆一口气全部扔掉。但实际上，从被扔进来的那一刻起，东西就一直放在那里，从未动过，只有格雷戈尔在垃圾中爬行的时候，才可能将其蹭到其他地方。他刚开始会把东西蹭开是迫不得已，因为没有足够的空间供他四处爬行。但是，后来他开始喜欢这么做，尽管在障碍物中穿行让他感到心情悲伤，身体倦怠，而且之后会一动不动地呆上几个小时。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him, he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there.They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen.These earnest gentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on things’ being tidy.This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen.Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty.They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them.For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard.All these things found their way into Gregor’s room.The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too.The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there.He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it.The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else.At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in the way left him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner.One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks.Gregor’s mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes.The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell.The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen.It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">No-one noticed him, though.The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed them anxiously.It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.Yet Gregor’s sister was playing so beautifully.Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression.Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.Was he an animal if music could captivate him so?It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for.He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would.He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it.On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“萨姆沙先生！”中间的绅士对着父亲大叫道，用食指指着正在地上缓慢爬行的格雷戈尔，没有说一句多余的话。小提琴沉默了，中间那位绅士首先是摇着头，对着他的两位好友微笑，接着就回头去看格雷戈尔。父亲似乎觉得当务之急是先安抚这三位绅士，而不是赶走格雷戈尔，尽管他们压根就没有感到不安，反而还觉得格雷戈尔比刚才的小提琴演奏更有趣。父亲摊开双臂，仓促地走到他们跟前，试图将他们赶回房间。同时，他还试着用身体挡住他们观看格雷戈尔的视线。此刻，他们确实有点生气了，但是不知道他们生气是被父亲的行为惹恼了，还是开始意识到他们事先未被告知隔壁住着格雷戈尔这样一位邻居。他们要求父亲做出解释，并像父亲一样举起手臂，激动地拽了拽胡子，慢慢吞吞地挪回他们的房间。当演奏突然被打断时，妹妹陷入了绝望之中，但此时她已经克服了这种绝望。她垂下手，任由琴和弓有气无力地悬挂了一会儿，但她继续看着乐谱，好像仍在演奏。接着，她突然振作起来，将乐器放到母亲的膝盖上，跑向隔壁房间。母亲依然坐在原处，费力挣扎着想喘过气来。在父亲的压力下，三位绅士更加迅速地走向自己的房间。妹妹双手熟练的操作着，床上的枕头和铺盖都飞扬起来，被整理得井井有条。在绅士们到达房间之前，她已经铺好床，溜了出去。父亲似乎如此沉醉于他正在做的事情之中，以至于完全忘了对房客应有的尊重。他继续催促他们，直到他都到了房间的门口。中间的那位绅士吼声如雷，猛跺着脚，这才让父亲停了下来。“现在，我在此声明，”他抬起手，看了一眼格雷戈尔的母亲和妹妹以引起她们的注意，说道，“鉴于这间公寓以及这个家庭出现的恶劣情况，”——他短暂而坚定地看了下地板——“我要立即解除租房协议。当然，虽然我已经在此住了几天，但我不仅会分文不给，相反地，还会考虑是否对你们带来的伤害提出诉讼。请相信我，这种诉讼的理由很容易找到。”他沉默了，眼睛看着正前方，似乎在等待着什么。实际上，他的两个朋友也插了句话：“我们也要立即解除租约。”就在这个时候，他握着门把手，猛然摔上了门。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mr. Samsa!” shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward.The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body.Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father’s behavior that annoyed them or the dawning realization that they had had a neighbor like Gregor in the next room without knowing it.They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly.Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted.She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants.He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt.“I declare here and now,” he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and sister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on my room.For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.”He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something.And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate notice.”With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >父亲用手摸索着方向，摇摇晃晃退回他的座位，一屁股跌坐了进去。他看上去就像是平时晚上舒展身体打盹一样，但是他的头完全不受控制，情不自禁地不停点着。可以看出，他根本就没有睡着。整个过程中，格雷戈尔一直静静地躺在原地，也就是三位绅士第一次看见他的地方。也许是因为计划失败的失落感，也许是因为饥饿让他太虚弱，他完全动弹不得。他确信随时会有人攻击他，所以他等待着。母亲膝盖上的小提琴从她颤抖的手中滑下，跌落在地板上，发出沉重的响声。这也没能把格雷戈尔从这种状态下惊醒。</td>
		<td class="en">Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him.His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move.He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited.He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister.All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor.He stopped and looked round.They seemed to have realized his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked.The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him.It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush.She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“What now, then?” Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness.He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all.This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural.He also felt relatively comfortable.It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.He thought back of his family with emotion and love.If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister.He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too.Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们决定打发这一天的最好的方法是放松和散步。他们赚取了一次暂停工作来休息的机会——他们的确非常需要休息一下了。于是，他们坐在桌子边撰写三张请假条。萨姆沙先生的是给他老板的，他妻子的是给承包商的，格蕾特的则是给校长的。当他们正在书写的时候，清洁工走了进来，告诉他们她正准备离开，那天早上的活儿她已经干完了。起初，他们三人都在埋头书写，也没抬头看就点了点头。直到发现她仍然没有离开的意向，便烦躁地抬头看了看。“怎么了？”萨姆沙先生问道。杂活女工面带笑容地站在门口，好像是有个重大的喜讯要报告，但是别人不问她就不说。她帽子上的小鸵鸟毛直直地乍起来，朝四面八方轻轻晃动。在她替萨姆沙一家打杂时，那些鸵鸟毛一直惹得萨姆沙先生很恼火。“那么，你想要什么？”萨姆沙太太问道，这个清洁工一直最敬重她。“是的，”她回答道，突然友好地大笑起来，这也使得她无法立刻说话，“现在好了，躺在那里的东西，你们不必担心该如何摆脱它。它已经被完全清理掉了。”萨姆沙太太和格蕾特趴在信纸上，像是一心一意只想继续写假条。萨姆沙先生看到清洁工想开始详细描述一切，就摊开手掌，明确表示没必要说下去。因此，正当他们阻止她讲述所有细节之时，她突然想到自己正处于匆忙之中，就很不高兴地喊道：“那么再见啦，各位！”说完就迅速转身离开，走的时候还“砰”的一声使劲把门关上了。</td>
		<td class="en">They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it.So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal.The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for that morning.The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation.“Well?” asked Mr. Samsa.The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to.The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions.“What is it you want then?” asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for.“Yes,” she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then, that thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get rid of it.That’s all been sorted out.”Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to.So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone,” turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今晚就把她给炒掉。”萨姆沙先生说道。但是他的妻子和女儿并没给予任何答复，这个杂活女工似乎扰乱了他们刚刚才获得的平静。她们站起来，走到窗户旁边，呆在那里搂着对方。萨姆沙先生在椅子里扭来扭去，看着她们，并坐在那里观察了片刻。接着，他喊道：“过来！就让我们忘了所有的往事，好吗？过来给我一点关怀吧。”两个女人立刻顺从地匆匆跑了过来，亲吻他，拥抱他。接着，他们很快将假条写完。</td>
		<td class="en">“Tonight she gets sacked,” said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained.They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other.Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while.Then he called out: “Come here, then.Let’s forget about all that old stuff, shall we？Come and give me a bit of attention”.The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后，他们三人一起离开了公寓——几个月以来他们一直没离开过那里——他们乘电车去了城外空旷的乡村。他们搭上了电车，车里充满了温暖的阳光，照耀着他们所有人。他们舒服地斜倚在座位上，讨论着他们的前途。经过进一步推敲，他们发现其实他们并不太糟糕——以前他们绝口不问彼此的工作。可是，现在他们三人都有了很好的工作，并对未来都充满了美好憧憬。当然，如果搬家，他们的现状就可以轻而易举地得到最大的改善。他们目前住的这间公寓是格雷戈尔以前挑选的，现在他们需要的是一间比这更小、更便宜、地理位置更好并且更实用的公寓。一路上，格蕾特变得越来越活跃。由于最近他们一直都提心吊胆，她的脸颊变得很苍白。不过，在谈话中，萨姆沙先生和太太几乎同时有了这样一个念头：他们的女儿长成了一位身材姣好的美少女。他们变得安静起来。从彼此眼神的交汇中，不知不觉间，他们一致认为就要到给她找个好对象的时候了。同时，好像是为了印证他们崭新的梦想和良好的意图，一抵达目的地，格蕾特就第一个起身，舒展着她年轻的身体。</td>
		<td class="en">After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town.They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves.Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future.The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical.All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.They became quieter.Just from each other’s glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her.And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.</td></tr>
