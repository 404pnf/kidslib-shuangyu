		<td class="en">by O. Henry</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我和老麦克·朗斯伯里各自存下了四万美金，摆脱了那种像捉迷藏似的淘金生活。我称他为“老”麦克，可他并不老。四十一岁吧，我估计；但他看上去总是显得很老。</td>
		<td class="en">Me and old Mack Lonsbury, we got out of that Little Hide-and-Seek gold mine affair with about $40,000 apiece.I say “old” Mack; but he wasn’t old.Forty-one, I should say; but he always seemed old.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“安迪，”他对我说，“我对劳碌奔波的生活已经厌倦了。你和我已经一起努力工作了三年。我们不妨休息一段时间，挥霍一些我们骗来后一直放着没有用的钱。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Andy,” he says to me, “I’m tired of hustling.You and me have been working hard together for three years.Say we knock off for a while, and spend some of this idle money we’ve coaxed our way.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的建议正合我意。”我说，“我们可以过几天富豪的日子，看看那是什么滋味。我们要干些什么呢——去看尼亚加拉大瀑布，还是去玩法罗牌？”</td>
		<td class="en">“The proposition hits me just right,” says I.“Let’s be nabobs for a while and see how it feels.What’ll we do—take in the Niagara Falls, or buck at faro?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好多年来，”麦克说，“我一直想着如果我有了一大笔钱，我要找个地方租一个两居室的小木屋，雇一个中国厨师做饭，而我则穿着长筒袜坐着读巴克尔的《文明史》。”</td>
		<td class="en">“For a good many years,” says Mack, “I’ve thought that if I ever had extravagant money I’d rent a two-room cabin somewhere, hire a Chinese to cook, and sit in my stocking feet and read Buckle’s History of Civilisation.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听起来纵情愉悦，而且没有庸俗摆阔的气息，”我说，“我想不出更好的方式来花钱啦。给我一个布谷鸟闹钟和一本塞普·温纳编的《班卓琴自学教程》，我就和你一起去。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That sounds self-indulgent and gratifying without vulgar ostentation,” says I; “and I don’t see how money could be better invested.Give me a cuckoo clock and a Sep Winner’s Self-Instructor for the Banjo, and I’ll join you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一周后，我和麦克来到了这个离丹佛约三十英里的皮纳小镇，并找到一处正好适合我们的、雅致的二居室房子。我们在皮纳镇银行存了很多钱，还跟镇上340个居民一一握手。我们从丹佛带来了中国厨师、布谷鸟闹钟、巴克尔的著作和那本《自学教程》，有了它们，小木屋一下子就像个家了。</td>
		<td class="en">A week afterwards me and Mack hits this small town of Pina, about thirty miles out from Denver, and finds an elegant two-room house that just suits us.We deposited half-a-peck of money in the Pina bank and shook hands with every one of the 340 citizens in the town.We brought along the Chinese and the cuckoo clock and Buckle and the Instructor with us from Denver; and they made the cabin seem like home at once.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果有人告诉你说金钱带不来幸福，千万不要相信他。如果你能有机会看到老麦克坐在他的摇椅上，穿着蓝纱线短袜的双脚伸在窗台上，戴着眼镜沉浸在那本巴克尔的书中，你会觉得这满足惬意的情景就连洛克菲勒也要感到嫉妒。而我正在班卓琴上摸索《活力老黑人》的调子，布谷鸟闹钟按时报响，中国厨师阿星则搅乱了这种气氛，他做的火腿鸡蛋极其好闻，甚至盖过了种在背阴处的忍冬草的香气。等到天黑得看不清巴克尔的胡扯天书和《自学教程》上的音符时，我和麦克会点起烟袋，聊些关于科学、潜水采珠、坐骨神经痛、埃及、词语拼写、鱼、信风、皮革、感恩和老鹰的话题，还有许多我们之前都没有时间深谈的话题。</td>
		<td class="en">Never believe it when they tell you riches don’t bring happiness.If you could have seen old Mack sitting in his rocking-chair with his blue-yarn sock feet up in the window and absorbing in that Buckle stuff through his specs you’d have seen a picture of content that would have made Rockefeller jealous.And I was learning to pick out “Old Zip Coon” on the banjo, and the cuckoo was on time with his remarks, and Ah Sing was messing up the atmosphere with the handsomest smell of ham and eggs that ever laid the honeysuckle in the shade.When it got too dark to make out Buckle’s nonsense and the notes in the Instructor, me and Mack would light our pipes and talk about science and pearl diving and sciatica and Egypt and spelling and fish and trade-winds and leather and gratitude and eagles, and a lot of subjects that we’d never had time to explain our sentiments about before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天傍晚，麦克非常坦诚地问我是否对女人们的性情和手段了解甚多。</td>
		<td class="en">One evening Mack spoke up and asked me if I was much apprised in the habits and policies of women folks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，当然啦，”我拿捏着腔调说，“我对她们无所不知。女人的天性和她们的外貌，”我说道，“在我眼里清楚得如同落基山脉之于一头蓝眼睛的美洲驴子。我熟悉她们所有回避问题的小伎俩和恰到好处的自相矛盾。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, yes,” says I, in a tone of voice; “I know ’em from Alfred to Omaha.The feminine nature and similitude,” says I, “is as plain to my sight as the Rocky Mountains is to a blue-eyed burro.I’m onto all their little side-steps and punctual discrepancies.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我跟你说，安迪，”麦克叹了一口气说，“我对她们的天性一点儿都不了解。或许对她们我有一种想亲近的倾向，却始终没有尝试过。十四岁起我就自己谋生；对于女人这个种群，我好像从来没有像别人那样，试着对她们作出什么感情上的论断。有时候我真希望自己曾经作过。”老麦克说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I tell you, Andy,” says Mack, with a kind of sigh, “I never had the least amount of intersection with their predispositions.Maybe I might have had a proneness in respect to their vicinity, but I never took the time.I made my own living since I was fourteen; and I never seemed to get my ratiocinations equipped with the sentiments usually depicted toward the sect.I sometimes wish I had,” says old Mack.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“研究她们可不是容易的事，”我说，“而且大家的看法也各不相同。尽管她们的变化遵循基本的规律，我还是发现她们彼此之间往往差异明显。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They’re an adverse study,” says I, “and adapted to points of view.Although they vary in rationale, I have found ’em quite often obviously differing from each other in divergences of contrast.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我认为，”麦克继续说，“一个男人最好趁年轻时听从命运安排把她们娶来，留住他对于女性所怀有的热情。我把机会放走了，我想我现在已经太老了，不能再涉足这门课程了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It seems to me,” goes on Mack, “that a man had better take ’em in and secure his inspirations of the sect when he’s young and so preordained.I let my chance go by; and I guess I’m too old now to go hopping into the curriculum.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我不知道。”我对他说，“或许你可以这样安慰自己，你存有好多钱，并且不必受很多烦恼的束缚。不过，我不会因为对她们的了解而感到遗憾，”我说，“男人需要了解女人们的毛病和小动作，这样他才能在这个世上好好地生活。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I don’t know,” I tells him.“Maybe you better credit yourself with a barrel of money and a lot of emancipation from a quantity of uncontent.Still, I don’t regret my knowledge of ’em,” I says.“It takes a man who understands the symptoms and by-plays of women-folks to take care of himself in this world.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们留在了皮纳，因为我们喜欢这个地方。一些人可能喜欢把钱用于喧哗、狂欢和旅途奔波；但我和麦克已经饱尝了喧嚣和旅馆生活的滋味。当地的人们很友善；阿星做的菜也很合我们的口味；麦克和巴克尔亲密得活像一对盗墓贼，我也已经能在班卓琴上弹出一支热情洋溢的、近似“布法罗的姑娘呀，今晚你们能来么”的曲子。</td>
		<td class="en">We stayed on in Pina because we liked the place.Some folks might enjoy their money with noise and rapture and locomotion; but me and Mack we had had plenty of turmoils and hotel towels.The people were friendly; Ah Sing got the swing of the grub we liked; Mack and Buckle were as thick as two body-snatchers, and I was hitting out a cordial resemblance to “Buffalo Gals, Can’t You Come Out To-night,” on the banjo.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，我收到一封发自斯佩特的电报，发件人在新墨西哥郊区的矿上工作，我在那里有些股份。我必须去那儿一趟，而且要走两个月。我急切地想回到皮纳镇再次享受生活的乐趣。</td>
		<td class="en">One day I got a telegram from Speight, the man that was working on a mine I had an interest in out in New Mexico.I had to go out there; and I was gone two months.I was anxious to get back to Pina and enjoy life once more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到达木屋时，我几乎晕倒了。麦克正伫立在门前，如果天使也曾哭泣，我想他们当时也没有微笑的理由。</td>
		<td class="en">When I struck the cabin I nearly fainted.Mack was standing in the door; and if angels ever wept, I saw no reason why they should be smiling then.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个男人的样子让人大跌眼镜。是的，情况更糟，他是一架望远镜；他就是利克天文台上的大型望远镜。他身穿外套，脚上穿一双锃亮的鞋子，还穿着白色马甲，头戴一顶奢华的丝质帽，前襟别着一朵一盘菠菜大小的天竺葵。他不自然地笑着，脸部扭曲得如同可恶的店主，或患疝气的小孩儿。</td>
		<td class="en">That man was a spectacle.Yes; he was worse; he was a spyglass; he was the great telescope in the Lick Observatory.He had on a coat and shiny shoes and a white vest and a high silk hat; and a geranium as big as an order of spinach was spiked onto his front.And he was smirking and warping his face like an infernal storekeeper or a kid with colic.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，安迪，”麦克抬起头说，“看到你回来我真高兴。你走后这里发生了一些事情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hello, Andy,” says Mack, out of his face.“Glad to see you back.Things have happened since you went away.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我知道，”我说，“这看上去真是亵渎神明。上帝从没把你造成这样，麦克·朗斯伯里。你为什么要冒昧地做出这种粗鄙之事，破坏上帝的圣工呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I know it,” says I, “and a sacrilegious sight it is.God never made you that way, Mack Lonsbury.Why do you scarify His works with this presumptuous kind of ribaldry?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，安迪，”他说，“你走后他们推举我为治安法官。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, Andy,” says he, “they’ve elected me justice of the peace since you left.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我仔细打量了麦克。他踌躇满志、跃跃欲试。一个治安法官本应是郁郁寡欢、镇定自若的。</td>
		<td class="en">I looked at Mack close.He was restless and inspired.A justice of the peace ought to be disconsolate and assuaged.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正在这时，一个年轻女人从人行道上经过，我看到麦克半是傻笑半是脸红地举起他的帽子，微笑着鞠躬，她也微笑着低头致意，走过去了。</td>
		<td class="en">Just then a young woman passed on the sidewalk; and I saw Mack kind of half snicker and blush, and then he raised up his hat and smiled and bowed, and she smiled and bowed, and went on by.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你没希望的，”我说，“到了你这个年纪还害相思病。我原以为这种事不会发生在你身上。居然还穿着黑漆皮鞋！所有这些竟都发生在这短短的两个月里！”</td>
		<td class="en">“No hope for you,” says I, “if you’ve got the Mary-Jane infirmity at your age.I thought it wasn’t going to take on you.And patent leather shoes!All this in two little short months!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今晚我将为刚才路过的那位年轻女士举办婚礼。”麦克有点儿激动地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m going to marry the young lady who just passed to-night,” says Mack, in a kind of flutter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我落了点儿东西在邮局。”我说道，并快速地走开了。</td>
		<td class="en">“I forgot something at the post-office,” says I, and walked away quick.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在一百码以外的地方赶上了那个年轻女人。我向她举帽示礼，自报了姓名。她大约十九岁，看上去比实际年龄小。她脸一红，然后冷漠地看着我，仿佛我是《两个孤女》中的雪景一样。</td>
		<td class="en">I overtook that young woman a hundred yards away.I raised my hat and told her my name.She was about nineteen; and young for her age.She blushed, and then looked at me cool, like I was the snow scene from the “Two Orphans.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听说今晚你要结婚。”我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I understand you are to be married to-night,” I said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，”她说，“你有什么异议么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Correct,” says she.“You got any objections?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听着，小妞儿。”我开始说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Listen, sissy,” I begins.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是里波萨·雷德小姐。”她生气地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“My name is Miss Rebosa Redd,” says she in a pained way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我知道了。”我说。“现在听好，里波萨，我的年纪都够欠你爸的钱了。那个华而不实、衣冠楚楚、昏头昏脑，像只穿着黑漆皮鞋且无可救药的火鸡一样自以为是大摇大摆的老浮尸是我最好的朋友。你为什么要找上他，把他卷入这场婚姻交易里来呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I know it,” says I.“Now, Rebosa, I’m old enough to have owed money to your father.And that old, specious, dressed-up, garbled, sea-sick ptomaine prancing about avidiously like an irremediable turkey gobbler with patent leather shoes on is my best friend.Why did you go and get him invested in this marriage business?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么了，因为他是仅有的机会。”里波萨小姐答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, he was the only chance there was,” answers Miss Rebosa.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，”我说道，以一种可怖的神情表达着对她相貌和身材的赞美，“以你这样的美貌你可以挑选任何类型的男人。听着，里波萨。老麦克不是你想要的那种男人。照出生证上来算，你出生时他已经二十二岁了，里德。你如花般怒放的生命是不会长久地跟他在一起的。他已经散发出苍老、僵化和衰败的气息了。老麦克的春情勃发只是回光返照而已。他年轻时忽视了自己的资本，没和爱神现款交易，只拿到一张期票，现在控诉老天要求支付利息。里波萨，你下定决心要这样的婚姻么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nay,” says I, giving a sickening look of admiration at her complexion and style of features; “with your beauty you might pick any kind of a man.Listen, Rebosa.Old Mack ain’t the man you want.He was twenty-two when you was nee Reed, as the papers say.This bursting into bloom won’t last with him.He’s all ventilated with oldness and rectitude and decay.Old Mack’s down with a case of Indian summer.He overlooked his bet when he was young; and now he’s suing Nature for the interest on the promissory note he took from Cupid instead of the cash.Rebosa, are you bent on having this marriage occur?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，当然想要。”她晃着帽子上的三色紫罗兰说，“我想，换了其他人也会这么做的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, sure I am,” says she, oscillating the pansies on her hat, “and so is somebody else, I reckon.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“婚礼什么时间举行？”我问。</td>
		<td class="en">“What time is it to take place?” I asks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“六点。”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“At six o’clock,” says she.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我立即决定了我的计划。我要尽力解救老麦克。让那样一个善良、老练、不够结婚资格的人落到一个还在咬石笔、穿后背系扣衣服的小姑娘手里，我可不能泰然处之。</td>
		<td class="en">I made up my mind right away what to do.I’d save old Mack if I could.To have a good, seasoned, ineligible man like that turn chicken for a girl that hadn’t quit eating slate pencils and buttoning in the back was more than I could look on with easiness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“里波萨，”我诚恳地说，用上了我对女性理性直觉的所有了解，“难道皮纳镇没有小伙子吗——一个你非常喜欢的好小伙儿？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rebosa,” says I, earnest, drawing upon my display of knowledge concerning the feminine intuitions of reason—“ain’t there a young man in Pina—a nice young man that you think a heap of?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有啊，”里波萨说，摆动着她的紫罗兰，“当然有！你在想什么！天啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yep,” says Rebosa, nodding her pansies—“Sure there is! What do you think! Gracious!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他喜欢你么？”我问，“他在这件事上是什么立场？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Does he like you?” I asks.“How does he stand in the matter?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他疯了。”里波萨说，“妈妈不得不把门口的台阶泼湿，以免他一直坐在那儿。不过我想今晚过后一切都会结束。”话毕她叹了一口气。</td>
		<td class="en">“Crazy,” says Rebosa.“Ma has to wet down the front steps to keep him from sitting there all the time.But I guess that’ll be all over after to-night,” she winds up with a sigh.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“里波萨，”我说，“你对老麦克根本就没有这种所谓的爱慕之情，是吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rebosa,” says I, “you don’t really experience any of this adoration called love for old Mack, do you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天啊！没有。”女孩儿摇摇头说道，“我认为他跟岩床一样干瘪。你居然会这样想！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Lord! no,” says the girl, shaking her head.“I think he’s as dry as a lava bed. The idea!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你喜欢的年轻人是谁，里波萨？”我问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Who is this young man that you like, Rebosa?” I inquires.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他叫埃迪·贝尔斯。”她说，“他在克罗斯比的杂货店当店员。但一个月只挣三十五美元。埃拉·诺克斯曾经非常喜欢他。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s Eddie Bayles,” says she.“He clerks in Crosby’s grocery.But he don’t make but thirty-five a month.Ella Noakes was wild about him once.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老麦克告诉我，”我说，“他今晚六点要为你举行婚礼。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Old Mack tells me,” I says, “that he’s going to marry you at six o’clock this evening.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是这个时间。”她说，“婚礼在我家举行。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s the time,” says she.“It’s to be at our house.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“里波萨，”我说，“听我说，如果埃迪·贝尔斯有一千美元现金——一千美元，你想想，足够他独自买下一个店铺——如果你和埃迪有那么一笔钱谈婚论嫁，你会愿意于今晚五点同他结婚么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rebosa,” says I, “listen to me.If Eddie Bayles had a thousand dollars cash—a thousand dollars, mind you, would buy him a store of his own—if you and Eddie had that much to excuse matrimony on, would you consent to marry him this evening at five o’clock?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女孩儿看了我一分钟，我能看到她内心正无声地盘算着，如同所有的女人一样。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl looks at me a minute; and I can see these inaudible cogitations going on inside of her, as women will.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一千美元？”她说，“我当然愿意。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A thousand dollars?” says she.“Of course I would.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来吧，”我说，“我们去找埃迪。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come on,” says I.“We’ll go and see Eddie.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们来到克罗斯比的店铺，把埃迪叫了出来。他是一个脸上有雀斑、看上去值得尊敬的小伙子，当我提出我的提议时，他激动得身上一阵冷一阵热的。</td>
		<td class="en">We went up to Crosby’s store and called Eddie outside.He looked to be estimable and freckled; and he had chills and fever when I made my proposition.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在五点钟？”他说，“给我一千美元？请别叫醒我！呃，你真是那个在印度做香料生意退休回来的有钱叔叔啊！我要把老克罗斯比的杂货铺整个买下，由自己来经营。”</td>
		<td class="en">“At five o’clock?” says he, “for a thousand dollars?Please don’t wake me up!Well, you are the rich uncle retired from the spice business in India!I’ll buy out old Crosby and run the store myself.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们走进屋，叫老克罗斯比放下手头的活儿，并把这件事解释给他听。我写了一张一千美元的支票递给他。如果埃迪和里波萨在五点钟结婚，就由他把钱交给他们。</td>
		<td class="en">We went inside and got old man Crosby apart and explained it.I wrote my check for a thousand dollars and handed it to him.If Eddie and Rebosa married each other at five he was to turn the money over to them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，我祝福他们，自己走向树林游荡了一阵子。我坐在木桩上，仔细思考生活、老年、十二宫图、女人的那些事儿以及人的一生可能经历的所有混乱。我祝贺自己，因为我很可能把老朋友麦克从暮年回春的冲动中拯救了出来。我知道等他回过神来，摆脱痴迷，脱去黑漆皮鞋，他会感激的。“使老麦克不像这样堕落，”我想，“比一千美元更有价值。”最最高兴的是我曾对女人有所研究，丝毫没有被她们自负和善变的手段所欺骗。</td>
		<td class="en">And then I gave ’em my blessing, and went to wander in the wildwood for a season.I sat on a log and made cogitations on life and old age and the zodiac and the ways of women and all the disorder that goes with a lifetime.I passed myself congratulations that I had probably saved my old friend Mack from his attack of Indian summer.I knew when he got well of it and shed his infatuation and his patent leather shoes, he would feel grateful.“To keep old Mack disinvolved,” thinks I, “from relapses like this, is worth more than a thousand dollars.”And most of all I was glad that I’d made a study of women, and wasn’t to be deceived any by their means of conceit and evolution.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我回到家时一定有五点半了。我走进屋子，看到老麦克穿着旧衣服仰坐着靠在那里，穿着蓝色短袜的脚伸在窗台上，膝盖上摊着《文明史》。</td>
		<td class="en">It must have been half-past five when I got back home.I stepped in; and there sat old Mack on the back of his neck in his old clothes with his blue socks on the window and the History of Civilisation propped up on his knees.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这可不像是准备好六点举行婚礼的样子啊。”我故作天真地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“This don’t look like getting ready for a wedding at six,” I says, to seem innocent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，”麦克边说边去拿他的香烟，“提前到五点钟了。他们给我带消息来说时间改了。现在婚礼已经结束了。你干什么去了，离开这么久，安迪？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh,” says Mack, reaching for his tobacco, “that was postponed back to five o’clock.They sent me over a note saying the hour had been changed.It’s all over now.What made you stay away so long, Andy?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你听说那个婚礼的事了？”我问。</td>
		<td class="en">“You heard about the wedding?” I asks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我主持的。”他说，“我告诉过你我是治安法官。牧师去东部探望亲属了，我是镇上唯一能够主持婚礼的人。一个月前我就答应埃迪和里波萨要为他们举办婚礼啦。他是一个勤劳的小伙子，将来有一天他会拥有属于他自己的店铺。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I operated it,” says he.“I told you I was justice of the peace.The preacher is off East to visit his folks, and I’m the only one in town that can perform the dispensations of marriage.I promised Eddie and Rebosa a month ago I’d marry ’em.He’s a busy lad; and he’ll have a grocery of his own some day.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他会的。”我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“He will,” says I.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“婚礼上有很多女人，”麦克边抽烟边说，“但是我似乎一点儿都不了解她们。我希望我也能够熟悉她们的脾气性格，就像你说自己的那样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There was lots of women at the wedding,” says Mack, smoking up.“But I didn’t seem to get any ideas from ’em.I wish I was informed in the structure of their attainments like you said you was.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是两个月前的事了。”我说，伸手去拿班卓琴。</td>
		<td class="en">“That was two months ago,” says I, reaching up for the banjo.</td></tr>
