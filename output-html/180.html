		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >结束了。苏斌库经历了漫长的充满痛苦和恐惧的旅行后，就像一只要飞回欧洲各国首都的鸽子，终于停在了俄属美洲，这里比以往到的地方都要远。他坐在雪地里，双手被绑在背后，等待着折磨的来临。他好奇地盯着眼前一个高大的哥萨克人，那个人俯卧在雪地里，痛苦地呻吟着。那些人处理完大个子后，把他交给了女人们。她们的凶残程度超过了那些男人，大个子的哭喊声便能证明这一点。</td>
		<td class="en">It was the end.Subienkow had travelled a long trail of bitterness and horror, homing like a dove for the capitals of Europe, and here, farther away than ever, in Russian America, the trail ceased.He sat in the snow, arms tied behind him, waiting the torture.He stared curiously before him at a huge Cossack, prone in the snow, moaning in his pain.The men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the women.That they exceeded the fiendishness of the men, the man’s cries attested.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >苏斌库看着，浑身战栗。他不怕死。在从华沙到努拉托的疲惫旅程中，他已经活得太久了，久到不会仅仅因为死亡而颤抖。但是他不愿受折磨。这是对他的灵魂的冒犯。反过来，这种冒犯并不是源于他所要承受的痛苦而已，而是由于这痛苦会让他表现出悲惨的样子。他知道他会祈祷、求饶、哀求，甚至会像大个子伊凡和之前被折磨的其他人那样。这很不好。勇敢地、利落地死去，带着微笑、打着趣——啊，这才是应该有的方式！但是如果克制不住，肉体的剧痛让灵魂饱受煎熬，像个傻瓜一样乱喊乱叫、语无伦次，表现出十足的畜生样——啊，那才叫可怕呢。</td>
		<td class="en">Subienkow looked on, and shuddered.He was not afraid to die.He had carried his life too long in his hands, on that weary trail from Warsaw to Nulato, to shudder at mere dying.But he objected to the torture.It offended his soul.And this offence, in turn, was not due to the mere pain he must endure, but to the sorry spectacle the pain would make of him.He knew that he would pray, and beg, and entreat, even as Big Ivan and the others that had gone before.This would not be nice.To pass out bravely and cleanly, with a smile and a jest—ah! that would have been the way.But to lose control, to have his soul upset by the pangs of the flesh, to screech and gibber like an ape, to become the veriest beast—ah, that was what was so terrible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一直都没有逃走的机会。从一开始，他热切盼望波兰独立的时候，他就已经成为被命运支配的一只木偶。从一开始，命运一直驱赶着他到华沙，到圣彼得堡，到西伯利亚矿区，到坎目赤阿特卡，到皮毛强盗摇摇晃晃的船上，直到他走到这一步。毋庸置疑，他的这种结局已打在世界的地基里——他敏锐、敏感，神经几乎从未躲在身体里，而且他是个梦想家、诗人和艺术家。他还从未想过，命运就决定要让他这个有着颤抖的敏感神经的人处在原始荒凉的未开化状态里，而且要在夜晚，在这片远方的土地，在这个世界之外的黑暗角落里死去。</td>
		<td class="en">There had been no chance to escape.From the beginning, when he dreamed the fiery dream of Poland’s independence, he had become a puppet in the hands of Fate.From the beginning, at Warsaw, at St. Petersburg, in the Siberian mines, in Kamtchatka, on the crazy boats of the fur-thieves, Fate had been driving him to this end.Without doubt, in the foundations of the world was graved this end for him—for him, who was so fine and sensitive, whose nerves scarcely sheltered under his skin, who was a dreamer, and a poet, and an artist.Before he was dreamed of, it had been determined that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that constituted him should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery, and to die in this far land of night, in this dark place beyond the last boundaries of the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他叹了口气。他眼前的人就是大个子伊凡——大个子伊凡是个巨人，是个不敏感的人，有着钢铁般的意志。这个哥萨克人是个海盗，他像公牛一样冷静，神经极不敏感，对常人来说的痛感对他而言不过是挠痒痒。然而，请相信这些努拉托印第安人，他们会找到大个子伊凡的神经，并追随它们直到进入他战栗的灵魂的深处。无疑，他们正在做这件事。很难想象一个人经受了这么多折磨还活着。大个子伊凡正在为他不敏感的神经付出代价。他坚持的时间已经是其他人的两倍了。</td>
		<td class="en">He sighed.So that thing before him was Big Ivan—Big Ivan the giant, the man without nerves, the man of iron, the Cossack turned freebooter of the seas, who was as phlegmatic as an ox, with a nervous system so low that what was pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him.Well, well, trust these Nulato Indians to find Big Ivan’s nerves and trace them to the roots of his quivering soul.They were certainly doing it.It was inconceivable that a man could suffer so much and yet live.Big Ivan was paying for his low order of nerves.Already he had lasted twice as long as any of the others.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >苏斌库觉得，对哥萨克人承受的折磨，他忍受不了多长时间了。为什么伊凡还没死呢？那种叫喊声再不停止的话，他就要疯了。但如果真的停了，那就轮到他了。还有亚卡加在等着他，现在就开始对他呲牙咧嘴地笑着。他上周才用狗鞭抽过亚卡加的脸，并把他撵出堡垒。　　　亚卡加会好好“招呼”他的。无疑，亚卡加为他保留了更厉害的折磨方法和更高明的摧残方式。啊！从伊凡的尖叫来看，他肯定结结实实挨了一下。俯身面向他的那些印第安女人们笑着、拍着手向后退去。苏斌库看到那恶魔行径，开始歇斯底里地笑了起来。印第安人惊奇地看着他，不知道他为何大笑。但苏斌库停不下来。</td>
		<td class="en">Subienkow felt that he could not stand the Cossack’s sufferings much longer.Why didn’t Ivan die?He would go mad if that screaming did not cease.But when it did cease, his turn would come.And there was Yakaga awaiting him, too, grinning at him even now in anticipation—Yakaga, whom only last week he had kicked out of the fort, and upon whose face he had laid the lash of his dog-whip.Yakaga would attend to him.Doubtlessly Yakaga was saving for him more refined tortures, more exquisite nerve-racking.Ah! that must have been a good one, from the way Ivan screamed.The squaws bending over him stepped back with laughter and clapping of hands.Subienkow saw the monstrous thing that had been perpetrated, and began to laugh hysterically.The Indians looked at him in wonderment that he should laugh.But Subienkow could not stop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这不管用。他控制住自己，一阵阵的抽动渐渐停止了。他竭力去想其他事，开始回忆自己的生活。他想起了自己的爸爸妈妈、有斑点的小矮马和那个法国老师，他曾教过他舞蹈并且曾偷偷塞给他一本已经破旧了的伏尔泰的书。他又看见了巴黎、沉闷的伦敦、快乐的维也纳，还有罗马。他又一次看见了那群狂热的年轻人，他们甚至和他一样梦想着波兰独立，希望有个国王在华沙掌握王权。啊，这一切就是从那里开始的啊。他坚持得最久。从圣彼得堡的那两个人开始，被处死的人一个接着一个，他计算着那些无畏的亡灵。在这儿，有一个人被狱警打死；在那儿，在被流放者的那条血迹斑斑的公路上，他们行进了无数个月，又有一个人被哥萨克卫兵们殴打、虐待，在途中倒下了。总是野蛮行径——残暴的、野兽般的行径。他们有的死于高烧，有的死于矿井之中，有的被鞭打至死。最后的两个人在逃跑后，在与哥萨克人的战斗中丧生。他独自一人带着从一个旅行者那里偷来的证件和钱，顺利地来到坎目赤阿特卡，那个旅行者的尸体被扔在雪地里。</td>
		<td class="en">This would never do.He controlled himself, the spasmodic twitchings slowly dying away.He strove to think of other things, and began reading back in his own life.He remembered his mother and his father, and the little spotted pony, and the French tutor who had taught him dancing and sneaked him an old worn copy of Voltaire.Once more he saw Paris, and dreary London, and gay Vienna, and Rome.And once more he saw that wild group of youths who had dreamed, even as he, the dream of an independent Poland with a king of Poland on the throne at Warsaw.Ah, there it was that the long trail began.Well, he had lasted longest.One by one, beginning with the two executed at St. Petersburg, he took up the count of the passing of those brave spirits.Here one had been beaten to death by a jailer, and there, on that bloodstained highway of the exiles, where they had marched for endless months, beaten and maltreated by their Cossack guards, another had dropped by the way.Always it had been savagery—brutal, bestial savagery.They had died—of fever, in the mines, under the knout.The last two had died after the escape, in the battle with the Cossacks, and he alone had won to Kamtchatka with the stolen papers and the money of a traveller he had left lying in the snow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了暴行，没有别的。这些年来，他把热情投注于画室、剧院还有法庭，一直都被暴行包围。他用别人的鲜血换来了自己的性命。每个人都杀过人。他为了抢护照，杀死了那个旅行者。他一天之内和两个俄国军官决斗，证明自己还是个很有能力的人。他必须证明自己，才能在皮毛强盗中赢得一席之地。他必须赢得那一席之地。他身后是横贯整个西伯利亚和俄国的已存在数千年的路。他不能从那里逃走。唯一的出路在前面，穿过冰冷黑暗的白令海去阿拉斯加。这条路从残暴行径通向更残暴的行径。在皮毛强盗的破船上，没有食物也没有水，在狂风肆虐的海上不停遭到风暴袭击，船上的人已经变成了野兽。他从坎目赤阿特卡向东航行过三次。这三次，经过各种各样的困难和苦难，幸存者都得以重返坎目赤阿特卡。无路可逃，也不能原路返回，因为等待他的会是矿井和鞭打。</td>
		<td class="en">It had been nothing but savagery.All the years, with his heart in studios, and theatres, and courts, he had been hemmed in by savagery.He had purchased his life with blood.Everybody had killed.He had killed that traveller for his passports.He had proved that he was a man of parts by duelling with two Russian officers on a single day.He had had to prove himself in order to win to a place among the fur-thieves.He had had to win to that place.Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.He could not escape that way.The only way was ahead, across the dark and icy sea of Bering to Alaska.The way had led from savagery to deeper savagery.On the scurvy-rotten ships of the fur-thieves, out of food and out of water, buffeted by the interminable storms of that stormy sea, men had become animals.Thrice he had sailed east from Kamtchatka.And thrice, after all manner of hardship and suffering, the survivors had come back to Kamtchatka.There had been no outlet for escape, and he could not go back the way he had come, for the mines and the knout awaited him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又一次向东航行，第四次也是最后一次。他曾和那些第一次找到传说中的海豹岛的人在一起；但他没有和他们一起回来分享坎目赤阿特卡的疯狂暴行中所得到的大量皮毛。他曾发誓决不回去。他知道，要成功到达欧洲各国可敬的首府，必须继续向前。所以他换了船，依然呆在这片黑暗的新土地上。他的同伴有斯拉沃尼亚猎手、俄国冒险家、蒙古人、鞑靼人和西伯利亚土著居民，他们在这个残暴的新世界里杀出了一条血路。他们屠杀不愿意贡奉毛皮的整村村民；反过来，他们自己也被船上的同伴所杀。他和一个芬兰人是这一伙人中仅剩的两名幸存者。他们在阿留申的一个孤岛上度过了孤独饥饿的寒冬，而且能在春天被另一艘毛皮船营救的机会十分渺茫。</td>
		<td class="en">Again, the fourth and last time, he had sailed east.He had been with those who first found the fabled Seal Islands; but he had not returned with them to share the wealth of furs in the mad orgies of Kamtchatka.He had sworn never to go back.He knew that to win to those dear capitals of Europe he must go on.So he had changed ships and remained in the dark new land.His comrades were Slavonian hunters and Russian adventurers, Mongols and Tartars and Siberian aborigines; and through the savages of the new world they had cut a path of blood.They had massacred whole villages that refused to furnish the fur-tribute; and they, in turn, had been massacred by ships’ companies.He, with one Finn, had been the sole survivor of such a company.They had spent a winter of solitude and starvation on a lonely Aleutian isle, and their rescue in the spring by another fur-ship had been one chance in a thousand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但那可怕的残暴行为总是包围着他。他从一艘船到另一艘船，从不后退，终于来到了往南去的船上。沿着阿拉斯加海岸一路走，他们遇见的只有一群又一群的野蛮人。每次在突出的小岛间或大陆的嶙峋峭壁间抛锚停船都意味着一场战争或者风暴。这或者是由于狂风肆虐，他们面临着被毁灭的威胁；或者是由于嘶喊着的土著人驶来了作战用的独木舟，他们脸上画着作战的油彩，来领教这些海盗们的火药的嗜血功效。一直沿着海岸向南航行，扫清了去加利福尼亚神秘之地的道路。据说，西班牙冒险家就是从这里开始了始于墨西哥的奋勇前进的历程。他也曾有过这些西班牙冒险家的希望。只要能投奔他们，剩下的就都再简单不过了——一年或两年，时间长点短点都无妨——他会顺利地来到墨西哥，然后得到一条船，整个欧洲都会是他的。但他们没遇见一个西班牙人。他们遇见的只是同样坚不可摧的野蛮城墙。这个世界里的居民，全身涂着油彩准备作战，把他们从岸边逼退。最终，当一艘船被击毁，所有的人都被杀死的时候，船长放弃了搜寻皮毛的努力，掉头向北逃去。</td>
		<td class="en">But always the terrible savagery had hemmed him in.Passing from ship to ship, and ever refusing to return, he had come to the ship that explored south.All down the Alaska coast they had encountered nothing but hosts of savages.Every anchorage among the beetling islands or under the frowning cliffs of the mainland had meant a battle or a storm.Either the gales blew, threatening destruction, or the war canoes came off, manned by howling natives with the war-paint on their faces, who came to learn the bloody virtues of the sea-rovers’ gunpowder.South, south they had coasted, clear to the myth-land of California.Here, it was said, were Spanish adventurers who had fought their way up from Mexico.He had had hopes of those Spanish adventurers.Escaping to them, the rest would have been easy—a year or two, what did it matter more or less—and he would win to Mexico, then a ship, and Europe would be his.But they had met no Spaniards.Only had they encountered the same impregnable wall of savagery.The denizens of the confines of the world, painted for war, had driven them back from the shores.At last, when one boat was cut off and every man killed, the commander had abandoned the quest and sailed back to the north.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那已经过了很多年。米查拉夫斯基的前哨站建好后，他在特本考夫手下服役。他在卡斯科奎姆地区呆了两年。两年之后的六月份，他已经在科策布湾的岬角那儿了。　　　　这个时候，各个部落聚集于此进行交易。这里有西伯利亚的斑点鹿皮、代奥米德群岛的象牙、北极海岸的海象皮、奇异的石灯，这些东西在部落之间不断转手，没人知道它们究竟来自哪里，而且有一次还有一把英国猎刀。苏斌库知道在这里可以好好地学学地理知识。他遇见了来自诺顿海峡、国王岛、圣劳伦斯岛、威尔士王子角和巴罗角的爱斯基摩人。这些地方都有别的名字，它们的距离是用路程所需的天数来衡量的。</td>
		<td class="en">The years had passed.He had served under Tebenkoff when Michaelovski Redoubt was built.He had spent two years in the Kuskokwim country.Two summers, in the month of June, he had managed to be at the head of Kotzebue Sound.Here, at this time, the tribes assembled for barter; here were to be found spotted deerskins from Siberia, ivory from the Diomedes, walrus skins from the shores of the Arctic, strange stone lamps, passing in trade from tribe to tribe, no one knew whence, and, once, a hunting-knife of English make; and here, Subienkow knew, was the school in which to learn geography.For he met Eskimos from Norton Sound, from King Island and St. Lawrence Island, from Cape Prince of Wales, and Point Barrow.Such places had other names, and their distances were measured in days.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些来交易的野蛮人来自广阔的区域，而通过反复交易，他们的石灯和钢刀则会是来自更广阔的区域。苏斌库威吓、哄骗、贿赂他们。每个远行者或者奇怪的部落男子都会被带到他面前。这里有无法描述、难以想象的危险，还有野兽、敌对部落、无法通过的丛林和巍峨的山峦；但在远处总是有这样的传言：有一些蓝眼金发的白人像魔鬼一样战斗，总是到处搜寻皮毛。他们向东走——很远很远的东边。没人见过他们。只是传言这样。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a vast region these trading savages came from, and a vaster region from which, by repeated trade, their stone lamps and that steel knife had come.Subienkow bullied, and cajoled, and bribed.Every far-journeyer or strange tribesman was brought before him.Perils unaccountable and unthinkable were mentioned, as well as wild beasts, hostile tribes, impenetrable forests, and mighty mountain ranges; but always from beyond came the rumour and the tale of white-skinned men, blue of eye and fair of hair, who fought like devils and who sought always for furs.They were to the east—far, far to the east.No one had seen them.It was the word that had been passed along.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这不是个容易的学校。通过各种奇怪的方言，从总把事实与传言相混、根据路途困难程度用“睡几觉”来衡量距离的无知的人那里，是不可能学好地理的。但最终一个传言给了苏斌库勇气。在东方有一条大河，那里都是蓝眼睛的人。那条河叫育空河。在米查拉夫斯基前哨站南边流出另一条大河，俄国人叫它奎克帕克河。根据传言，这两条河是同一条。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a hard school.One could not learn geography very well through the medium of strange dialects, from dark minds that mingled fact and fable and that measured distances by “sleeps” that varied according to the difficulty of the going.But at last came the whisper that gave Subienkow courage.In the east lay a great river where were these blue-eyed men.The river was called the Yukon.South of Michaelovski Redoubt emptied another great river which the Russians knew as the Kwikpak.These two rivers were one, ran the whisper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >苏斌库回到了米查拉夫斯基。　　　整整一年，他强烈请求到奎克帕克去探险。然后有了马拉科夫，他是俄国混血儿，率领那些最野蛮、最凶狠的出类拔萃的混血冒险家，这些人从坎目赤阿特卡聚到一起。苏斌库是他的海军上尉。他们穿过了奎克帕克巨大的三角洲迷宫，看到了北岸的第一排小山，乘着兽皮独木舟在流速为五节的河水中奋力前行了500英里，独木舟上的交易货物和弹药满得快要溢出来了。这条河有二到十英里那么宽，在一个数英寻深的海峡中流淌。马拉科夫决定在努拉托建堡垒。而苏斌库强烈要求再往北去。但他很快就安心呆在努拉托了。漫长的冬天就要到了。最好还是等着。第二年年初，冰雪消融后，他就会离开奎克帕克，前往哈得孙湾公司的贸易站。马拉科夫从没听过奎克帕克河就是育空河的传言，苏斌库也没告诉他。</td>
		<td class="en">Subienkow returned to Michaelovski.For a year he urged an expedition up the Kwikpak.Then arose Malakoff, the Russian half-breed, to lead the wildest and most ferocious of the hell’s broth of mongrel adventurers who had crossed from Kamtchatka.Subienkow was his lieutenant.They threaded the mazes of the great delta of the Kwikpak, picked up the first low hills on the northern bank, and for half a thousand miles, in skin canoes loaded to the gunwales with trade-goods and ammunition, fought their way against the five-knot current of a river that ran from two to ten miles wide in a channel many fathoms deep.Malakoff decided to build the fort at Nulato.Subienkow urged to go farther.But he quickly reconciled himself to Nulato.The long winter was coming on.It would be better to wait.Early the following summer, when the ice was gone, he would disappear up the Kwikpak and work his way to the Hudson Bay Company’s posts.Malakoff had never heard the whisper that the Kwikpak was the Yukon, and Subienkow did not tell him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >开始建堡垒。这是个强制性的工程。一层层的原木墙在努拉托印第安人的叹息和呻吟中建了起来。鞭子抽在他们背上，而握着鞭子的是无情的海盗们。有的印第安人试图逃跑，而一旦被抓回来，他们的四肢就会被扳开绑在堡垒前，这样，他们和他们的部落都明白了皮鞭的厉害。两个人被打死了，其他的人身受重伤，剩下的人牢牢地记住了教训，再也不逃跑了。堡垒还没建成，就已经大雪纷飞，是时候要掠夺皮毛了。部落需要交纳很多的贡奉。皮鞭和拳头继续存在，贡奉必须得交，妇女和儿童便被当成了人质，他们遭受了只有这些皮毛强盗才知道的非人对待。</td>
		<td class="en">Came the building of the fort.It was enforced labour.The tiered walls of logs arose to the sighs and groans of the Nulato Indians.The lash was laid upon their backs, and it was the iron hand of the freebooters of the sea that laid on the lash.There were Indians that ran away, and when they were caught they were brought back and spread-eagled before the fort, where they and their tribe learned the efficacy of the knout.Two died under it; others were injured for life; and the rest took the lesson to heart and ran away no more.The snow was flying ere the fort was finished, and then it was the time for furs.A heavy tribute was laid upon the tribe.Blows and lashings continued, and that the tribute should be paid, the women and children were held as hostages and treated with the barbarity that only the fur-thieves knew.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是一笔血债，现在是血债血偿的时候了。堡垒没了。堡垒着火了，火光中，一半的强盗都被杀死了。剩下的一半被折磨至死。只有苏斌库幸存，或者说只有苏斌库和大个子伊凡，如果那个在雪地里呻吟哀嚎的人可以被称作大个子伊凡的话。苏斌库发现亚卡加正在对他咧嘴笑。无可否认，就是亚卡加。他脸上还留有被鞭打的痕迹。毕竟，苏斌库不能指责他什么，但他想到亚卡加将要对他做的事就心生反感。他想到去求首领马卡穆克，但他的判断力告诉他，这样的恳求一点用都没有。他也想过挣脱镣铐，拼死抵抗。这样死得干脆。但他根本挣不脱镣铐。驯鹿皮带比他要强得多。正这样想着，他又有了新的念头。他示意要找马卡穆克，还要一个懂得海滨方言的翻译。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, it had been a sowing of blood, and now was come the harvest.The fort was gone.In the light of its burning, half the fur-thieves had been cut down.The other half had passed under the torture.Only Subienkow remained, or Subienkow and Big Ivan, if that whimpering, moaning thing in the snow could be called Big Ivan.Subienkow caught Yakaga grinning at him.There was no gainsaying Yakaga.The mark of the lash was still on his face.After all, Subienkow could not blame him, but he disliked the thought of what Yakaga would do to him.He thought of appealing to Makamuk, the head-chief; but his judgment told him that such appeal was useless.Then, too, he thought of bursting his bonds and dying fighting.Such an end would be quick.But he could not break his bonds.Caribou thongs were stronger than he.Still devising, another thought came to him.He signed for Makamuk, and that an interpreter who knew the coast dialect should be brought.</td></tr>
