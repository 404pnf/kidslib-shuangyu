		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人在年轻气盛时往往有各种欲望，因而可能遭受诸多不幸，而未经深思熟虑就盲目选择甜点业或许就是一例。作为一个英国仆人的儿子，主要靠吃咸肉和发面团长大，他怎能知道玻璃罐装的糖衣杏仁和粉色糖果也会吃腻——在他看来那可是天堂了，又怎能体会当梅子面包都不能带来一丁点儿兴奋感时，生活竟会乏味到极致？幼年时，在他看来甜点商就是全世界都会妒忌的王子——早饭吃蛋白杏仁饼干，午饭吃蛋白甜饼，晚饭吃主显节糕饼，还有冰糖或薄荷糖当加餐——他怎么会预料到当初的明智选择也会有让人感到悲哀的一天？那时他会发现做一个甜点商并没有什么社会地位，对实现他的雄心壮志也没什么帮助。我认识一个在形而上学方面颇有天赋的人，他年轻时不慎选择了舞蹈教练的职业。可以想象，那些自以为是的反对者们如何利用他当初的这个错误，告诫公众不要相信他那不可理喻的教义。他不能放弃教授舞蹈课，因为他以此为生，而且形而上学对他而言，并非如同面包里的盐一样不可或缺。戴维·福克斯先生和他的甜点生意正是如此。他的叔叔是布里格福特附近一座大宅子的管家，小时候叔叔非常宠爱他。有一次他去那个繁荣的城镇拜访他叔叔，仅仅一天功夫，镇上的那些甜食店就点燃了他幼年的想象力。戴维带着美妙的幻想回到家中：甜点商一定是世上最幸福愉快、最举足轻重的人，因为他做的东西不仅外观赏心悦目，味道也极为可口，就连市长大人举办私人宴会的时候也要从他那里订购许多糖果。所以当爸爸让他选一门行当时，戴维毫不犹豫地选择了这一行当。对甜食的狂热让他轻率地做出决定，义无反顾地扎进了甜点业。然而，很快他就觉得索然无味，提不起兴趣了。而且这段时间以来，他的思维不断开阔，又有了新的野心，年轻气盛时选择的甜点业显然不能满足他了。但是他要做什么呢？戴维是个思想活跃的年轻人，新点子层出不穷。但是当时，他只是在做糖果、蜜饯和酥皮糕点上有天赋，别的却不拿手。说到各种思想的推理过程有什么特征，用新的思路审视课题有哪些好处，黄油与面粉的比例如何调配，烤制糕点的温度如何调节，你也许能讲得头头是道，但你还是无法当上首相。而且，目前社会组织结构并不完善，还存在着很多社会阻碍。戴维可以用做松饼的方法做出可口的新品，对甜点业有最全面的见解，但在其他方面，他也确实感觉到了理论知识和实用技能的贫乏。而且世界上还存在种种不便之处，要做一个好人的模糊意识，并不是在任何行业都能有所建树的可靠保证。</td>
		<td class="en">Among the many fatalities attending the bloom of young desire, that of blindly taking to the confectionery line has not, perhaps, been sufficiently considered.How is the son of a British yeoman, who has been fed principally on salt pork and yeast dumplings, to know that there is satiety for the human stomach even in a paradise of glass jars full of sugared almonds and pink lozenges, and that the tedium of life can reach a pitch where plum-buns at discretion cease to offer the slightest excitement?Or how, at the tender age when a confectioner seems to him a very prince whom all the world must envy—who breakfasts on macaroons, dines on meringues, sups on twelfth-cake, and fills up the intermediate hours with sugar-candy or peppermint—how is he to foresee the day of sad wisdom, when he will discern that the confectioner’s calling is not socially influential, or favourable to a soaring ambition?I have known a man who turned out to have a metaphysical genius, incautiously, in the period of youthful buoyancy, commence his career as a dancing-master; and you may imagine the use that was made of this initial mistake by opponents who felt themselves bound to warn the public against his doctrine of the Inconceivable.He could not give up his dancing-lessons, because he made his bread by them, and metaphysics would not have found him in so much as salt to his bread.It was really the same with Mr. David Faux and the confectionery business.His uncle, the butler at the great house close by Brigford, had made a pet of him in his early boyhood, and it was on a visit to this uncle that the confectioners’ shops in that brilliant town had, on a single day, fired his tender imagination.He carried home the pleasing illusion that a confectioner must be at once the happiest and the foremost of men, since the things he made were not only the most beautiful to behold, but the very best eating, and such as the Lord Mayor must always order largely for his private recreation; so that when his father declared he must be put to a trade, David chose his line without a moment’s hesitation; and, with a rashness inspired by a sweet tooth, wedded himself irrevocably to confectionery.Soon, however, the tooth lost its relish and fell into blank indifference; and all the while, his mind expanded, his ambition took new shapes, which could hardly be satisfied within the sphere his youthful ardour had chosen.But what was he to do?He was a young man of much mental activity, and, above all, gifted with a spirit of contrivance; but then, his faculties would not tell with great effect in any other medium than that of candied sugars, conserves, and pastry.Say what you will about the identity of the reasoning process in all branches of thought, or about the advantage of coming to subjects with a fresh mind, the adjustment of butter to flour, and of heat to pastry, is not the best preparation for the office of prime minister; besides, in the present imperfectly-organized state of society, there are social barriers.David could invent delightful things in the way of drop-cakes, and he had the widest views of the sugar department; but in other directions he certainly felt hampered by the want of knowledge and practical skill; and the world is so inconveniently constituted, that the vague consciousness of being a fine fellow is no guarantee of success in any line of business.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些困难，甚至在戴维·福克斯的学徒生涯还未结束前，就已重重地压在了他肩上。他应该成为一个杰出的人，这样的想法让他的灵魂躁动不安。他无法像其他人那样接受那小得可怜的一杯羹，即使平均分，他都不屑一顾。戴维确信自己不是一个普通的人：即使像蒂比茨夫人这样一个洗衣女工，也注意到了这点，她也有可能是从他衣服的质地看出来的。在那段特别的日子里，戴维一直在称姜汁脆饼的重量，但是这种反常现象不会持续下去的。没有哪个职位是适合戴维·福克斯先生的，因为没有哪个职位既不耗费体力又能给人带来极大的精神满足。如果他出生在当今这个时代，充分利用在技术院校学习的机会，他肯定会去研究文学或者是写评论。但事实上他接受的并不是文科教育。他在隔壁的流动图书馆里读过一些小说，也买过英克尔和亚瑞克的故事书，他对故事中可怜的英克尔先生深感同情。所以他的思想也许达到了从事文学的特定要求，但是他的拼写和用词却太随意了。</td>
		<td class="en">This difficulty pressed with some severity on Mr. David Faux, even before his apprenticeship was ended.His soul swelled with an impatient sense that he ought to become something very remarkable—that it was quite out of the question for him to put up with a narrow lot as other men did: he scorned the idea that he could accept an average.He was sure there was nothing average about him: even such a person as Mrs. Tibbits, the washer-woman, perceived it, and probably had a preference for his linen.At that particular period he was weighing out gingerbread nuts; but such an anomaly could not continue.No position could be suited to Mr. David Faux that was not in the highest degree easy to the flesh and flattering to the spirit.If he had fallen on the present times, and enjoyed the advantages of a Mechanic’s Institute, he would certainly have taken to literature and have written reviews; but his education had not been liberal.He had read some novels from the adjoining circulating library, and had even bought the story of Inkle and Yarico, which had made him feel very sorry for poor Mr. Inkle; so that his ideas might not have been below a certain mark of the literary calling; but his spelling and diction were too unconventional.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果一个人在自己的国家得不到充分的赏识或者是找不到满意的位置，他的思想自然会转向国外。戴维发挥想象力以他极有限的地理知识搜罗了一遍又一遍，想要寻找一个国家，那里的人能够热情好客地接受他这样一个面容苍白、没有嘴唇、头发短粗的人，他完全有权利这样期望。戴维大体知道美国是一个以黑人居多数的国家，他觉得对一个白人移民来说是再好不过的发财之地了，因为首先肤色就是一个显著的优势。这种想法渐渐变得越来越强烈，以至于撒旦趁机唆使他：想要移民还是很简单的，只要他从师傅的存钱箱里拿那么一点儿钱就行。但是我相信我们高估了魔鬼撒旦的认知，他这次要白费一番功夫了。如果他确定受损失的只有师傅一个人，戴维当然想把师傅的一些钱据为己有。但是，戴维毕竟是个谨慎的年轻人，他还是决定不去冒这个险。所以一直到学徒期满，他都没有做什么明显的不轨之事，至于移民计划，他决定将来再找机会。最终他是这样来实现他的移民计划的。在家蹭吃蹭喝一两个星期之后，他闲来无事探明了一个对他至关重要的事情：他妈妈有一小笔几尼，那是她做女仆辛苦积攒的，放在抽屉的一角，和他的亚麻布婴儿服放在一起，二十年来，那婴儿服一直放在那个抽屉里。二十年前戴维刚学会走路，当时他有点儿罗圈腿，长大后虽没完全长成罗圈腿，可也还是有一点儿。老福克斯先生曾对儿子坦言，不要指望靠他出钱做买卖。他有七个儿子呢，其中还有个体格健全的傻子，每天要吃掉一个直径八英寸的面团，他去世时能给他们每人留下一百个几尼就已经很不错了。在这种情况下，戴维该怎么办呢？对他来说，去偷母亲的钱当然很为难，但是又找不到别的现成办法得到钱。没想到他一个堂堂正正的大好青年竟然要忍受这些没必要的麻烦。再说了，拿走母亲的财产也不算偷盗啊：她又不会去告发你。而且在他妈妈看来戴维可是个乖孩子。他会在妈妈面前自夸，并向妈妈保证自己热爱诚实，绝不会做那些同龄孩子干的坏事，他总是借这些好话来安慰母亲。要是母亲能拿她那二十个几尼来奖励他这种高尚品质，他就不必去偷了，他也就更加心安理得。不过，在戴维这样思维活跃的人看来，足智多谋还是不乏乐趣的：偷偷摸清母亲存钱的抽屉只是上了普通的钥匙锁（而不是丘伯牌保险锁），只需要配上一把同样的钥匙，再安排个小插曲让自己摆脱嫌疑，还不耽误在父亲去世时拿到属于自己的一百个几尼，这样，即便自己在印度群岛挣不到大钱——这不大可能——也没什么后顾之忧了。想想这一系列的事情，戴维越发觉得有趣。</td>
		<td class="en">When a man is not adequately appreciated or comfortably placed in his own country, his thoughts naturally turn towards foreign climes; and David’s imagination circled round and round the utmost limits of his geographical knowledge, in search of a country where a young gentleman of pasty visage, lipless mouth, and stumpy hair, would be likely to be received with the hospitable enthusiasm which he had a right to expect.Having a general idea of America as a country where the population was chiefly black, it appeared to him the most propitious destination for an emigrant who, to begin with, had the broad and easily recognizable merit of whiteness; and this idea gradually took such strong possession of him that Satan seized the opportunity of suggesting to him that he might emigrate under easier circumstances, if he supplied himself with a little money from his master’s till.But that evil spirit, whose understanding, I am convinced, has been much overrated, quite wasted his time on this occasion.David would certainly have liked well to have some of his master’s money in his pocket, if he had been sure his master would have been the only man to suffer for it; but he was a cautious youth, and quite determined to run no risks on his own account.So he stayed out his apprenticeship, and committed no act of dishonesty that was at all likely to be discovered, reserving his plan of emigration for a future opportunity.And the circumstances under which he carried it out were in this wise.Having been at home a week or two partaking of the family beans, he had used his leisure in ascertaining a fact which was of considerable importance to him, namely, that his mother had a small sum in guineas painfully saved from her maiden perquisites, and kept in the corner of a drawer where her baby-linen had reposed for the last twenty years—ever since her son David had taken to his feet, with a slight promise of bow-legs which had not been altogether unfulfilled.Mr. Faux, senior, had told his son very frankly, that he must not look to being set up in business by him: with seven sons, and one of them a very healthy and well-developed idiot, who consumed a dumpling about eight inches in diameter every day, it was pretty well if they got a hundred apiece at his death.Under these circumstances, what was David to do?It was certainly hard that he should take his mother’s money; but he saw no other ready means of getting any, and it was not to be expected that a young man of his merit should put up with inconveniences that could be avoided.Besides, it is not robbery to take property belonging to your mother: she doesn’t prosecute you.And David was very well behaved to his mother; he comforted her by speaking highly of himself to her, and assuring her that he never fell into the vices he saw practised by other youths of his own age, and that he was particularly fond of honesty.If his mother would have given him her twenty guineas as a reward of this noble disposition, he really would not have stolen them from her, and it would have been more agreeable to his feelings.Nevertheless, to an active mind like David’s, ingenuity is not without its pleasures: it was rather an interesting occupation to become stealthily acquainted with the wards of his mother’s simple key (not in the least like Chubb’s patent), and to get one that would do its work equally well; and also to arrange a little drama by which he would escape suspicion, and run no risk of forfeiting the prospective hundred at his father’s death, which would be convenient in the improbable case of his not making a large fortune in the “Indies.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >首先，他大谈自己不久要去利物浦，然后乘船去美国的打算。这个决定让他的妈妈颇为伤感，因为除去雅各布那个傻儿子，没有哪个儿子会像她的小儿子戴维那样牵动她的心。接下来，他觉得对于想要拿走母亲的私房钱儿子来说，礼拜日下午绝对是个难得的好机会，因为除了雅各布和那个牛仔，全家人都会去教堂。他甚至认为，这是仁慈的上帝有意安排的。大斋节的第三个礼拜日尤为方便，因为雅各布近来两天恰好又开始四处溜达了。生性胆小的戴维对雅各布是又怕又恨，雅各布身材那么魁梧，还总是拿着把干草叉走来走去。</td>
		<td class="en">First, he spoke freely of his intention to start shortly for Liverpool and take ship for America; a resolution which cost his good mother some pain, for, after Jacob the idiot, there was not one of her sons to whom her heart clung more than to her youngest-born, David.Next, it appeared to him that Sunday afternoon, when everybody was gone to church except Jacob and the cowboy, was so singularly favourable an opportunity for sons who wanted to appropriate their mothers’ guineas, that he half thought it must have been kindly intended by Providence for such purposes.Especially the third Sunday in Lent; because Jacob had been out on one of his occasional wanderings for the last two days; and David, being a timid young man, had a considerable dread and hatred of Jacob, as of a large personage who went about habitually with a pitchfork in his hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戴维说自己这个礼拜日下午要去伦恩先生家喝茶，对他而言，这是不去教堂最好的说辞，伦恩先生漂亮的女儿萨莉和他可是青梅竹马。待那些去教堂的人走远后，戴维从木盒中取出几尼，偷偷塞进一个小帆布包。然后大声告诉牛仔自己要出门了，让他看好家，别让礼拜日闲逛的流浪汉闯进来，这一切都再简单不过了。戴维想，他同样也能很容易地找到一处小灌木丛，把帆布袋放进预先挖好的一个小洞里，埋在一棵空心老白腊树下。事实上，他不费吹灰之力就找到了这么个小洞，然后扒开，就在他要轻轻地把帆布袋丢进去时，他听见一个魁梧的身躯脚步窸窣地靠近他，嘴里还念念有词，这可真是太意外了，像他这样一个足智多谋的绅士，自然只会对自己预料的事情有所准备。结果，他一慌，帆布袋没能轻轻放进洞里，而是哐啷一声掉了下去，于是袋口就松开了，亮闪闪的几尼散落出来。这时，他一抬头，发现他亲爱的哥哥雅各布就站在身旁，拿着一把干草叉，那闪亮锋利的叉尖伸出来一码远，离戴维只有一英尺。（我曾经对一位博学多识的朋友讲起过这件事，他认为，是戴维的负罪感让这叉尖显得那么恐怖，如果内心光明磊落，就不会惧怕这可怖的干草叉。我觉得这一观点非常宝贵，他允许我在不透露他姓名的情况下引用他的话。）话虽如此，戴维并没被吓得魂飞魄散，否则他早就瘫坐在地上或者连连后退了。相反，他呆在原地，朝雅各布微笑着。雅各布不停地点头，说道：“嗨嗤，扎维！”他的发音很费劲而又模糊不清。戴维的心“怦怦”直跳，如果他有嘴唇的话那时肯定是煞白的。但他的心智非但没有麻痹，反而受到刺激加速起来。他在心底暗自祷告（他害怕时常常这么办）——“噢，这次饶了我吧，我再也不做这种冒险的事了！”——他一边祷告，一边把手伸到口袋里摸索那盒黄色的糖果，这是他从布里格福特带回来的，一并还有其他同样便携的小吃，用来取悦高傲的美人儿，尤其是萨拉·伦恩小姐。他从未把这些好吃的分给可怜的雅各布，因为戴维才不会浪费自己的软糖和麦芽糖来讨好他没什么指望的人。但是面对一个你搞不清来意、手里拿着干草叉的傻子，你却很有必要像恭维路易·拿破仑一样拍拍他的马屁。因此戴维灵机一动，掏出他那盒黄色的糖果来，打开盖子，用嘴巴和手指比划着，那意思仿佛说他很高兴见到他亲爱的雅各布哥哥，趁此机会送他一份小礼物，他则会发现这盒东西非常好吃。你知道，雅各布可不是个十足的傻子，以其有限的理解力，他也知道怎么挑好的，不要坏的。他拿了一颗糖果，做出品尝的样子，吮了吮，仿佛是位哲学家。当他尝到那新鲜而又浓郁的味道时所流露出来的狂喜，就像卡利班尝到特林鸠罗的美酒一样，他痴痴地笑着拍拍突然对自己示好的弟弟，伸手还要。除了间歇性地发怒，平时雅各布脾气也不坏，不会随便跟人抢东西。戴维丢了的魂回来了大半，他停止了祈祷，往雅各布手心里倒了十几颗糖果，努力表现得与他很亲近。他原本计划今天下午去看望萨莉·伦恩小姐，所以就随身带着这些小零食好去讨好她。他绝对是个幸运儿，的确，好像相比其他人，上帝更加青睐他，既然他命中注定要被发现，与其让其他人看见，还不如就让一个傻子当这个目击者。生平第一次，戴维觉得他看到了傻子的优点。</td>
		<td class="en">Nothing could be easier, then, than for David on this Sunday afternoon to decline going to church, on the ground that he was going to tea at Mr. Lunn’s, whose pretty daughter Sally had been an early flame of his, and, when the church-goers were at a safe distance, to abstract the guineas from their wooden box and slip them into a small canvas bag—nothing easier than to call to the cowboy that he was going, and tell him to keep an eye on the house for fear of Sunday tramps.David thought it would be easy, too, to get to a small thicket and bury his bag in a hole he had already made and covered up under the roots of an old hollow ash, and he had, in fact, found the hole without a moment’s difficulty, had uncovered it, and was about gently to drop the bag into it, when the sound of a large body rustling towards him with something like a bellow was such a surprise to David, who, as a gentleman gifted with much contrivance, was naturally only prepared for what he expected, that instead of dropping the bag gently he let it fall so as to make it untwist and vomit forth the shining guineas.In the same moment he looked up and saw his dear brother Jacob close upon him, holding the pitchfork so that the bright smooth prongs were a yard in advance of his own body, and about a foot off David’s.(A learned friend, to whom I once narrated this history, observed that it was David’s guilt which made these prongs formidable, and that the “mens nil conscia sibi” strips a pitchfork of all terrors.I thought this idea so valuable, that I obtained his leave to use it on condition of suppressing his name.) Nevertheless, David did not entirely lose his presence of mind; for in that case he would have sunk on the earth or started backward; whereas he kept his ground and smiled at Jacob, who nodded his head up and down, and said, “Hoich, Zavy!” in a painfully equivocal manner.David’s heart was beating audibly, and if he had had any lips they would have been pale; but his mental activity, instead of being paralysed, was stimulated.While he was inwardly praying (he always prayed when he was much frightened)—“Oh, save me this once, and I’ll never get into danger again!”—he was thrusting his hand into his pocket in search of a box of yellow lozenges, which he had brought with him from Brigford among other delicacies of the same portable kind, as a means of conciliating proud beauty, and more particularly the beauty of Miss Sarah Lunn.Not one of these delicacies had he ever offered to poor Jacob, for David was not a young man to waste his jujubes and barley-sugar in giving pleasure to people from whom he expected nothing.But an idiot with equivocal intentions and a pitchfork is as well worth flattering and cajoling as if he were Louis Napoleon.So David, with a promptitude equal to the occasion, drew out his box of yellow lozenges, lifted the lid, and performed a pantomime with his mouth and fingers, which was meant to imply that he was delighted to see his dear brother Jacob, and seized the opportunity of making him a small present, which he would find particularly agreeable to the taste.Jacob, you understand, was not an intense idiot, but within a certain limited range knew how to choose the good and reject the evil: he took one lozenge, by way of test, and sucked it as if he had been a philosopher; then, in as great an ecstacy at its new and complex savour as Caliban at the taste of Trinculo’s wine, chuckled and stroked this suddenly beneficent brother, and held out his hand for more; for, except in fits of anger, Jacob was not ferocious or needlessly predatory.David’s courage half returned, and he left off praying; pouring a dozen lozenges into Jacob’s palm, and trying to look very fond of him.He congratulated himself that he had formed the plan of going to see Miss Sally Lunn this afternoon, and that, as a consequence, he had brought with him these propitiatory delicacies: he was certainly a lucky fellow; indeed, it was always likely Providence should be fonder of him than of other apprentices, and since he was to be interrupted, why, an idiot was preferable to any other sort of witness.For the first time in his life, David thought he saw the advantage of idiots.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而雅各布早已把干草叉插在了地上，一屁股坐在那里，眨着眼，咂着嘴，嘴里含着五颗糖果，那种美妙感觉真是前所未有。他完全没有注意到那些几尼，但坐下来时，他宽大的右手正好搭在上面，还毫无意识地保持着那个姿势，沉浸在糖果刺激味蕾的美妙感觉中。要是他能在戴维藏好几尼之前，一直沉浸在糖果的美味中而完全察觉不到就好了！这是戴维对于自身安全最好的期待。要知道雅各布认得他妈妈的几尼，因为每逢节假日，妈妈会允许他们看看这些漂亮的钱币，把它们装在盒子里晃来晃去，而这成为了他们共同经历的一部分。在雅各布关于金钱仅有的记忆中，这部分可能是最难忘的了。</td>
		<td class="en">As for Jacob, he had thrust his pitchfork into the ground, and had thrown himself down beside it, in thorough abandonment to the unprecedented pleasure of having five lozenges in his mouth at once, blinking meanwhile, and making inarticulate sounds of gustative content.He had not yet given any sign of noticing the guineas, but in seating himself he had laid his broad right hand on them, and unconsciously kept it in that position, absorbed in the sensations of his palate.If he could only be kept so occupied with the lozenges as not to see the guineas before David could manage to cover them!That was David’s best hope of safety; for Jacob knew his mother’s guineas; it had been part of their common experience as boys to be allowed to look at these handsome coins, and rattle them in their box on high days and holidays, and among all Jacob’s narrow experiences as to money, this was likely to be the most memorable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来啊，雅各布，”戴维用一种巴结的语气喊道，并把盒子递给他，“我把这些都给你了。快跑！赶紧的！要不别人就要过来抢了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here, Jacob,” said David, in an insinuating tone, handing the box to him, “I’ll give ’em all to you.Run!—make haste!—else somebody’ll come and take ’em.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戴维没有研究过傻子的心理，并不知道假想的恐惧对他们而言毫无用处。雅各布左手接过盒子，但是他觉得没有跑的必要。一个有前途的年轻人，想通过挪用母亲的财产来积累财富，却碰上这么个搅局的人，简直是大白天撞见鬼了，怎么这么倒霉！但是雅各布总得拿开右手来打开锡盒的盖子，到时侯戴维就会以最快的速度把几尼扫进洞里，并立马坐在上面。啊，不！跟傻子打交道时任何预想都没用，他不会按照你的预想做事。雅各布的右手好像在摸索什么、丢着什么，他猛地握紧那些几尼，好似握着一堆鹅卵石，然后举起来准备像播种一样把它们扔到远处的荆棘中，忽然，不知受了什么刺激——也许是一种罕见的感觉——那只手停了下来，垂在膝边，雅各布呆滞地瞅着缓缓张开的手。戴维又开始祈祷，但很快停了下来，又有一计涌上心头。</td>
		<td class="en">David, not having studied the psychology of idiots, was not aware that they are not to be wrought upon by imaginative fears.Jacob took the box with his left hand, but saw no necessity for running away.Was ever a promising young man wishing to lay the foundation of his fortune by appropriating his mother’s guineas obstructed by such a day-mare as this?But the moment must come when Jacob would move his right hand to draw off the lid of the tin box, and then David would sweep the guineas into the hole with the utmost address and swiftness, and immediately seat himself upon them.Ah, no!It’s of no use to have foresight when you are dealing with an idiot: he is not to be calculated upon.Jacob’s right hand was given to vague clutching and throwing; it suddenly clutched the guineas as if they had been so many pebbles, and was raised in an attitude which promised to scatter them like seed over a distant bramble, when, from some prompting or other—probably of an unwonted sensation—it paused, descended to Jacob’s knee, and opened slowly under the inspection of Jacob’s dull eyes.David began to pray again, but immediately desisted—another resource having occurred to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“妈妈！兹尼！”天真的雅各布喊道。然后，他看着戴维，用质问的语气说道，“盒子呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mother! zinnies!” exclaimed the innocent Jacob.Then, looking at David, he said, interrogatively, “Box?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘘！嘘！”戴维一边说，一边在这紧张的气氛中使劲转动脑筋，“看，雅各布！”他从哥哥手中拿过锡盒，把里面的糖都倒出来，还给雅各布一半，自己偷偷留下一半。接着，他递出空盒子，说：“盒子给你，雅各布！装几尼的盒子！”说着他轻轻把金币从雅各布的掌心拨到盒子里。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hush! hush!” said David, summoning all his ingenuity in this severe strait.“See, Jacob!”  He took the tin box from his brother’s hand, and emptied it of the lozenges, returning half of them to Jacob, but secretly keeping the rest in his own hand.Then he held out the empty box, and said, “Here’s the box, Jacob!The box for the guineas!” gently sweeping them from Jacob’s palm into the box.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个过程并没有让雅各布感到不快，相反，几尼掉进盒子里时发出清脆悦耳的声音，他还想再听一遍，于是一把夺过盒子，兴奋地摇晃起来。戴维趁这机会把手里的糖扔到地上，迅速扫了些土盖上。“看，雅各布！”他最后说。雅各布止住叮叮当当的摇晃，向洞口看去，戴维开始挖着地上的土，好像还带着一副又疑惑又期待的表情。当糖露出来的时候，他一颗一颗地拿出来，给了雅各布。“嘘！”他高声耳语，“别告诉任何人，这都是你的，嘘——嘘！把几尼放进里面，他们也会变成糖的！”为了讲得更明白些，他拿出一个几尼，放进洞里，说：“这样放进去。”接着，他从洞里掏出最后一颗糖，说：“就变成这样了。”边说着，边把糖放进雅各布渴望的嘴里。</td>

		<td class="en">And here I must pause, to point out to you the short-sightedness of human contrivance.This ingenious young man, Mr. David Faux, thought he had achieved a triumph of cunning when he had associated himself in his brother’s rudimentary mind with the flavour of yellow lozenges.But he had yet to learn that it is a dreadful thing to make an idiot fond of you, when you yourself are not of an affectionate disposition: especially an idiot with a pitchfork—obviously a difficult friend to shake off by rough usage.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was clear to David now that he had only one alternative before him: he must either renounce the guineas, by quietly putting them back in his mother’s drawer (a course not unattended with difficulty); or he must leave more than a suspicion behind him, by departing early the next morning without giving notice, and with the guineas in his pocket.For if he gave notice that he was going, his mother, he knew, would insist on fetching from her box of guineas the three she had always promised him as his share; indeed, in his original plan, he had counted on this as a means by which the theft would be discovered under circumstances that would themselves speak for his innocence; but now, as I need hardly explain, that well-combined plan was completely frustrated.Even if David could have bribed Jacob with perpetual lozenges, an idiot’s secrecy is itself betrayal.He dared not even go to tea at Mr. Lunn’s, for in that case he would have lost sight of Jacob, who, in his impatience for the crop of lozenges, might scratch up the box again while he was absent, and carry it home—depriving him at once of reputation and guineas.No! he must think of nothing all the rest of this day, but of coaxing Jacob and keeping him out of mischief.It was a fatiguing and anxious evening to David; nevertheless, he dared not go to sleep without tying a piece of string to his thumb and great toe, to secure his frequent waking; for he meant to be up with the first peep of dawn, and be far out of reach before breakfast-time.His father, he thought, would certainly cut him off with a shilling; but what then?Such a striking young man as he would be sure to be well received in the West Indies: in foreign countries there are always openings—even for cats.It was probable that some Princess Yarico would want him to marry her, and make him presents of very large jewels beforehand; after which, he needn’t marry her unless he liked.David had made up his mind not to steal any more, even from people who were fond of him: it was an unpleasant way of making your fortune in a world where you were likely to surprised in the act by brothers.Such alarms did not agree with David’s constitution, and he had felt so much nausea this evening that no doubt his liver was affected.Besides, he would have been greatly hurt not to be thought well of in the world: he always meant to make a figure, and be thought worthy of the best seats and the best morsels.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Ruminating to this effect on the brilliant future in reserve for him, David by the help of his check-string kept himself on the alert to seize the time of earliest dawn for his rising and departure.His brothers, of course, were early risers, but he should anticipate them by at least an hour and a half, and the little room which he had to himself as only an occasional visitor, had its window over the horse-block, so that he could slip out through the window without the least difficulty.Jacob, the horrible Jacob, had an awkward trick of getting up before everybody else, to stem his hunger by emptying the milk-bowl that was “duly set” for him; but of late he had taken to sleeping in the hay-loft, and if he came into the house, it would be on the opposite side to that from which David was making his exit.There was no need to think of Jacob; yet David was liberal enough to bestow a curse on him—it was the only thing he ever did bestow gratuitously.His small bundle of clothes was ready packed, and he was soon treading lightly on the steps of the horse-block, soon walking at a smart pace across the fields towards the thicket.It would take him no more than two minutes to get out the box; he could make out the tree it was under by the pale strip where the bark was off, although the dawning light was rather dimmer in the thicket.But what, in the name of—burnt pastry—was that large body with a staff planted beside it, close at the foot of the ash-tree?David paused, not to make up his mind as to the nature of the apparition—he had not the happiness of doubting for a moment that the staff was Jacob’s pitchfork—but to gather the self-command necessary for addressing his brother with a sufficiently honeyed accent.Jacob was absorbed in scratching up the earth, and had not heard David’s approach.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">With this view of the times predominant among the tradespeople at Grimworth, their uncertainty concerning the nature of the business which the sallow-complexioned stranger was about to set up in the vacant shop, naturally gave some additional strength to the fears of the less sanguine.If he was going to sell drapery, it was probable that a pale-faced fellow like that would deal in showy and inferior articles—printed cottons and muslins which would leave their dye in the wash-tub, jobbed linen full of knots, and flannel that would soon look like gauze.If grocery, then it was to be hoped that no mother of a family would trust the teas of an untried grocer.Such things had been known in some parishes as tradesmen going about canvassing for custom with cards in their pockets: when people came from nobody knew where, there was no knowing what they might do.It was a thousand pities that Mr. Moffat, the auctioneer and broker, had died without leaving anybody to follow him in the business, and Mrs. Cleve’s trustee ought to have known better than to let a shop to a stranger.Even the discovery that ovens were being put up on the premises, and that the shop was, in fact, being fitted up for a confectioner and pastry-cook’s business, hitherto unknown in Grimworth, did not quite suffice to turn the scale in the newcomer’s favour, though the landlady at the Woolpack defended him warmly, said he seemed to be a very clever young man, and from what she could make out, came of a very good family; indeed, was most likely a good many people’s betters.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Either in reward of such virtue, or according to some more hidden law of sequence, Mr. Freely’s business, in spite of prejudice, started under favourable auspices.For Mrs. Chaloner, the rector’s wife, was among the earliest customers at the shop, thinking it only right to encourage a new parishioner who had made a decorous appearance at church; and she found Mr. Freely a most civil, obliging young man, and intelligent to a surprising degree for a confectioner; well-principled, too, for in giving her useful hints about choosing sugars he had thrown much light on the dishonesty of other tradesmen.Moreover, he had been in the West Indies, and had seen the very estate which had been her poor grandfather’s property; and he said the missionaries were the only cause of the negro’s discontent—an observing young man, evidently.Mrs. Chaloner ordered wine-biscuits and olives, and gave Mr. Freely to understand that she should find his shop a great convenience.So did the doctor’s wife, and so did Mrs. Gate, at the large carding-mill, who, having high connexions frequently visiting her, might be expected to have a large consumption of ratafias and macaroons.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Such was the sophistry with which this misguided young woman—enough.Mrs. Steene sent for the mince-pies, and, I am grieved to add, garbled her household accounts in order to conceal the fact from her husband.This was the second step in a downward course, all owing to a young woman’s being out of harmony with her circumstances, yearning after renegades and bulbuls, and being subject to claims from a veterinary surgeon fond of mince-pies.The third step was to harden herself by telling the fact of the bought mince-pies to her intimate friend Mrs. Mole, who had already guessed it, and who subsequently encouraged herself in buying a mould of jelly, instead of exerting her own skill, by the reflection that “other people” did the same sort of thing.The infection spread; soon there was a party or clique in Grimworth on the side of “buying at Freely’s”; and many husbands, kept for some time in the dark on this point, innocently swallowed at two mouthfuls a tart on which they were paying a profit of a hundred per cent., and as innocently encouraged a fatal disingenuousness in the partners of their bosoms by praising the pastry.Others, more keen-sighted, winked at the too frequent presentation on washing-days, and at impromptu suppers, of superior spiced-beef, which flattered their palates more than the cold remnants they had formerly been contented with.Every housewife who had once “bought at Freely’s” felt a secret joy when she detected a similar perversion in her neighbour’s practice, and soon only two or three old-fashioned mistresses of families held out in the protest against the growing demoralization, saying to their neighbours who came to sup with them, “I can’t offer you Freely’s beef, or Freely’s cheesecakes; everything in our house is home-made; I’m afraid you’ll hardly have any appetite for our plain pastry.”  The doctor, whose cook was not satisfactory, the curate, who kept no cook, and the mining agent, who was a great bon vivant, even began to rely on Freely for the greater part of their dinner, when they wished to give an entertainment of some brilliancy.In short, the business of manufacturing the more fanciful viands was fast passing out of the hinds of maids and matrons in private families, and was becoming the work of a special commercial organ.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As for the confectioner himself, he made his way gradually into Grimworth homes, as his commodities did, in spite of some initial repugnance.Somehow or other, his reception as a guest seemed a thing that required justifying, like the purchasing of his pastry.In the first place, he was a stranger, and therefore open to suspicion; secondly, the confectionery business was so entirely new at Grimworth, that its place in the scale of rank had not been distinctly ascertained.There was no doubt about drapers and grocers, when they came of good old Grimworth families, like Mr. Luff and Mr. Prettyman: they visited with the Palfreys, who farmed their own land, played many a game at whist with the doctor, and condescended a little towards the timber-merchant, who had lately taken to the coal-trade also, and had got new furniture; but whether a confectioner should be admitted to this higher level of respectability, or should be understood to find his associates among butchers and bakers, was a new question on which tradition threw no light.His being a bachelor was in his favour, and would perhaps have been enough to turn the scale, even if Mr. Edward Freely’s other personal pretensions had been of an entirely insignificant cast.But so far from this, it very soon appeared that he was a remarkable young man, who had been in the West Indies, and had seen many wonders by sea and land, so that he could charm the ears of Grimworth Desdemonas with stories of strange fishes, especially sharks, which he had stabbed in the nick of time by bravely plunging overboard just as the monster was turning on his side to devour the cook’s mate; of terrible fevers which he had undergone in a land where the wind blows from all quarters at once; of rounds of toast cut straight from the breadfruit trees; of toes bitten off by land-crabs; of large honours that had been offered to him as a man who knew what was what, and was therefore particularly needed in a tropical climate; and of a Creole heiress who had wept bitterly at his departure.Such conversational talents as these, we know, will overcome disadvantages of complexion; and young Towers, whose cheeks were of the finest pink, set off by a fringe of dark whisker, was quite eclipsed by the presence of the sallow Mr. Freely.So exceptional a confectioner elevated the business, and might well begin to make disengaged hearts flutter a little.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And it was quite true that, when business permitted, Mr. Freely thought a great deal of Penny.He thought her prettiness comparable to the loveliest things in confectionery; he judged her to be of submissive temper—likely to wait upon him as well as if she had been a negress, and to be silently terrified when his liver made him irritable; and he considered the Palfrey family quite the best in the parish, possessing marriageable daughters.On the whole, he thought her worthy to become Mrs. Edward Freely, and all the more so, because it would probably require some ingenuity to win her.Mr. Palfrey was capable of horse-whipping a too rash pretender to his daughter’s hand; and, moreover, he had three tall sons: it was clear that a suitor would be at a disadvantage with such a family, unless travel and natural acumen had given him a countervailing power of contrivance.And the first idea that occurred to him in the matter was, that Mr. Palfrey would object less if he knew that the Freelys were a much higher family than his own.It had been foolish modesty in him hitherto to conceal the fact that a branch of the Freelys held a manor in Yorkshire, and to shut up the portrait of his great uncle the admiral, instead of hanging it up where a family portrait should be hung—over the mantelpiece in the parlour.Admiral Freely, K.C.B., once placed in this conspicuous position, was seen to have had one arm only, and one eye—in these points resembling the heroic Nelson—while a certain pallid insignificance of feature confirmed the relationship between himself and his grand-nephew.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Next, Mr. Freely was seized with an irrepressible ambition to posses Mrs. Palfrey’s receipt for brawn, hers being pronounced on all hands to be superior to his own—as he informed her in a very flattering letter carried by his errand-boy.Now Mrs. Palfrey, like other geniuses, wrought by instinct rather than by rule, and possessed no receipts—indeed, despised all people who used them, observing that people who pickled by book, must pickle by weights and measures, and such nonsense; as for herself, her weights and measures were the tip of her finger and the tip of her tongue, and if you went nearer, why, of course, for dry goods like flour and spice, you went by handfuls and pinches, and for wet, there was a middle-sized jug—quite the best thing whether for much or little, because you might know how much a teacupful was if you’d got any use of your senses, and you might be sure it would take five middle-sized jugs to make a gallon.Knowledge of this kind is like Titian’s colouring, difficult to communicate; and as Mrs. Palfrey, once remarkably handsome, had now become rather stout and asthmatical, and scarcely ever left home, her oral teaching could hardly be given anywhere except at Long Meadows.Even a matron is not insusceptible to flattery, and the prospect of a visitor whose great object would be to listen to her conversation, was not without its charms to Mrs. Palfrey.Since there was no receipt to be sent in reply to Mr. Freely’s humble request, she called on her more docile daughter, Penny, to write a note, telling him that her mother would be glad to see him and talk with him on brawn, any day that he could call at Long Meadows.Penny obeyed with a trembling hand, thinking how wonderfully things came about in this world.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >也许与你的预计大相径庭，戴维·福克斯到达西印度群岛仅仅几年后，又回来了。他干起了老本行，跟那些从未出过远门的普通人没什么两样。生活里这类情况的确时常发生。如我们所知，有的人即使去了新环境，见了新事物，内心深处也未曾改变，甚至在新环境里也没有改行。</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps it was a result quite different from your expectations, that Mr. David Faux should have returned from the West Indies only a few years after his arrival there, and have set up in his old business, like any plain man who has never travelled.But these cases do occur in life.Since, as we know, men change their skies and see new constellations without changing their souls, it will follow sometimes that they don’t change their business under those novel circumstances.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，这个结果是戴维不曾预料到的。要知道，他曾期望能在“黑人”世界中干一番大事业，可要么是“黑人”已经见过太多白人，要么是因为别的缘故，一眼看去，他们并未觉得他高人一等。再有，那里也没有公主。在牙买加，没人仅仅因为喜欢戴维的出身，就会想帮他一把。虽然他对自己隐藏的优点了然于胸，可在牙买加却鲜有人赏识，不像如今在这个死气沉沉的旧世界，这些优点人尽皆知。所以，在奥伊斯特俱乐部，虽然戴维总是滔滔不绝、拐弯抹角地暗示他在富饶的西印度群岛过得多么随心所欲、放荡不羁，但我真的觉得他是自欺欺人，在那里他得为了生计而工作，到头来只有烹饪他干得最得心应手。他曾酝酿了几个绝妙的计划，企图算计一下那些有点儿小才能而腰缠万贯的人，但却一直没找到合适的时机。戴维设计了很多方案，希望不费吹灰之力就得到万贯家财。可这些方案最多在他脑子里转转，不像做甜食的手艺那般，在现实世界也行得通。用假的半便士和半克朗可能会蒙混过关，但我相信，要用半便士或半克朗冒充一金镑是绝对不可能的。在这个世界上，骗子也能赚得盆满钵满。不可否认，要是戴维胆子大些，这行也许很适合他。但他胆儿太小，做不了骗子，也绝不敢铤而走险去犯法。他只敢偷妈妈的钱。所以戴维只能乖乖地做回真实的自己，心满意足地做个有诚信的人，更确切地说，当个好甜点商。因为他虽然读过些书，也有些观察能力，但除了这一行，做别的他挣不了这么多钱。他甚至发现，干这行他还能不断提高自己的手艺，尝试各种烹饪方法。他逐渐明白，要是换做其他行当，自己成不了大事。命运女神对戴维毫不手软。虽然他曾想过逃到大洋彼岸，以此不向命运低头，但命运还是抓住了他，给他系上围裙，断掉他所有其他的生财之路，逼着他在金斯顿的某个厨房里琢磨蛋糕和馅饼。渐渐地，他开始向命运低头，因为命运待他不薄。但在热带做厨师时得的热病、痱子和其他疾病让他思恋起故乡了。所以，这一次戴维看清了命运对自己生计的安排，带上六年来的积蓄，又一次登船了。如果你要追问我，他在格里姆沃斯挣的钱是否都是明白、干净的，我只得承认，戴维心地纯良，没去揭发别人的不检行为，这让他挣了点儿钱。总之，戴维·福克斯发觉，再用自己的姓氏没什么前途，要开始新生活，改个新名字是个不错的方法，所以他觉得叫自己爱德华·弗瑞利也挺好。</td>
		<td class="en">Certainly, this result was contrary to David’s own expectations.He had looked forward, you are aware, to a brilliant career among “the blacks”; but, either because they had already seen too many white men, or for some other reason, they did not at once recognize him as a superior order of human being; besides, there were no princesses among them.Nobody in Jamaica was anxious to maintain David for the mere pleasure of his society; and those hidden merits of a man which are so well known to himself were as little recognized there as they notoriously are in the effete society of the Old World.So that in the dark hints that David threw out at the Oyster Club about that life of Sultanic self-indulgence spent by him in the luxurious Indies, I really think he was doing himself a wrong; I believe he worked for his bread, and, in fact, took to cooking as, after all, the only department in which he could offer skilled labour.He had formed several ingenious plans by which he meant to circumvent people of large fortune and small faculty; but then he never met with exactly the right circumstances.David’s devices for getting rich without work had apparently no direct relation with the world outside him, as his confectionery receipts had.It is possible to pass a great many bad half pennies and bad half-crowns, but I believe there has no instance been known of passing a halfpenny or a half-crown as a sovereign.A sharper can drive a brisk trade in this world: it is undeniable that there may be a fine career for him, if he will dare consequences; but David was too timid to be a sharper, or venture in any way among the mantraps of the law.He dared rob nobody but his mother.And so he had to fall back on the genuine value there was in him—to be content to pass as a good halfpenny, or, to speak more accurately, as a good confectioner.For in spite of some additional reading and observation, there was nothing else he could make so much money by; nay, he found in himself even a capability of extending his skill in this direction, and embracing all forms of cookery; while, in other branches of human labour, he began to see that it was not possible for him to shine.Fate was too strong for him; he had thought to master her inclination and had fled over the seas to that end; but she caught him, tied an apron round him, and snatching him from all other devices, made him devise cakes and patties in a kitchen at Kingstown.He was getting submissive to her, since she paid him with tolerable gains; but fevers and prickly heat, and other evils incidental to cooks in ardent climates, made him long for his native land; so he took ship once more, carrying his six years’ savings, and seeing distinctly, this time, what were Fate’s intentions as to his career.If you question me closely as to whether all the money with which he set up at Grimworth consisted of pure and simple earnings, I am obliged to confess that he got a sum or two for charitably abstaining from mentioning some other people’s misdemeanours.Altogether, since no prospects were attached to his family name, and since a new christening seemed a suitable commencement of a new life, Mr. David Faux thought it as well to call himself Mr. Edward Freely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，你瞧！虽然曾设想了各种可能性，觉得原来的名字不好，可他没想到，现在戴维·福克斯这个名字好像还能带来点儿好处。戴维是否应该像个有钱商人，对此不屑一顾？要是去律师那，兴许又能跟家人联系上，但这根本不是他想要的。而且，他不是很相信，“对他有好处的事”能有多大好处。可戴维转念一想，好处虽小也是好处，况且也许会发生什么出乎意料的好事，他有些好奇了。最终，戴维心里的天平倾斜了，他给律师写了封信，信的内容不再赘言，结果是戴维和他大哥要在斯特拉特先生那里见上一面。戴维也搞清楚了，那含混不清的“好事”是他父亲留给他的遗产——83英镑3先令。</td>
		<td class="en">But lo! now, in opposition to all calculable probability, some benefit appeared to be attached to the name of David Faux.Should he neglect it, as beneath the attention of a prosperous tradesman?It might bring him into contact with his family again, and he felt no yearnings in that direction: moreover, he had small belief that the “something to his advantage” could be anything considerable.On the other hand, even a small gain is pleasant, and the promise of it in this instance was so surprising, that David felt his curiosity awakened.The scale dipped at last on the side of writing to the lawyer, and, to be brief, the correspondence ended in an appointment for a meeting between David and his eldest brother at Mr. Strutt’s, the vague “something” having been defined as a legacy from his father of eighty-two pounds, three shillings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你知道，戴维想过自己不会得到遗产。跟其他不孝子一样，他的确不该得，可偏偏他有优秀的父母，即便是面对这样的儿子，良心让他们于心不忍，要知道就算是再有教养的人，也会被戴维气死。好心肠的福克斯太太永远不会忘记，是她生了这个不成器的儿子，刚出生时他是个多么无助的小家伙，根本不可能去做坏事。不知怎地，那时她就觉得，要是这孩子走了弯路，一定是父母的错，是他们没有尽到责任。福克斯太太觉得父母的责任并非多么高尚、多么宽容，但把儿子该得的那份家产给他，这就是父母要做的。因为一个人正正当当得了他该得的钱，还能去偷吗？要是一分钱都不给这个逆子，岂不是让他完全变坏?是的，既然戴维偷了二十几尼，那就从他应得的家产中扣掉二十几尼，但还要补给他三几尼，因为他妈妈始终觉得他偷的那二十几尼中有三几尼本来就是要给他的。虽然他离家出走，漂洋过海，钱还一直给他留着，可能哪一天他就回来了。福克斯先生同意妻子的看法，临死前，趁意识还清醒，他修改了遗嘱。曾经，家人们觉得戴维可能永远消失了。负责看管雅各布的大儿子常想，戴维也许已经死了，虽然有点儿难受，但是他知道，只要这点儿得到证实，戴维就不再是遗产的合法继承人了。然而天不遂人愿，一位邻居证实，戴维还活着，就在英格兰。他很肯定，在去坎特顿的路上看见戴维坐在一辆马车上，旁边有个胖子驾着车。虽然不知道自己为什么这么肯定，戴维脸上又没写着他的名字，但这个邻居发誓那就是他。大家虽没看见，但从他描述来看，很可能就是戴维。这就是报纸上那条广告的由来。</td>
		<td class="en">David, you know, had expected to be disinherited; and so he would have been, if he had not, like some other indifferent sons, come of excellent parents, whose conscience made them scrupulous where much more highly-instructed people often feel themselves warranted in following the bent of their indignation.Good Mrs. Faux could never forget that she had brought this ill-conditioned son into the world when he was in that entirely helpless state which excluded the smallest choice on his part; and, somehow or other, she felt that his going wrong would be his father’s and mother’s fault, if they failed in one tittle of their parental duty.Her notion of parental duty was not of a high and subtle kind, but it included giving him his due share of the family property; for when a man had got a little honest money of his own, was he so likely to steal?To cut the delinquent son off with a shilling, was like delivering him over to his evil propensities.No; let the sum of twenty guineas which he had stolen be deducted from his share, and then let the sum of three guineas be put back from it, seeing that his mother had always considered three of the twenty guineas as his; and, though he had run away, and was, perhaps, gone across the sea, let the money be left to him all the same, and be kept in reserve for his possible return.Mr. Faux agreed to his wife’s views, and made a codicil to his will accordingly, in time to die with a clear conscience.But for some time his family thought it likely that David would never reappear; and the eldest son, who had the charge of Jacob on his hands, often thought it a little hard that David might perhaps be dead, and yet, for want of certitude on that point, his legacy could not fall to his legal heir.But in this state of things the opposite certitude—namely, that David was still alive and in England—seemed to be brought by the testimony of a neighbour, who, having been on a journey to Cattelton, was pretty sure he had seen David in a gig, with a stout man driving by his side.He could “swear it was David,” though he could “give no account why, for he had no marks on him; but no more had a white dog, and that didn’t hinder folks from knowing a white dog.”  It was this incident which had led to the advertisement.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The legacy was paid, of course, after a few preliminary disclosures as to Mr. David’s actual position.He begged to send his love to his mother, and to say that he hoped to pay her a dutiful visit by and by; but, at present, his business and near prospect of marriage made it difficult for him to leave home.His brother replied with much frankness.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">On this arrangement being concluded, Mr. Prettyman begged Mr. Jonathan Faux to go and take a snack with him, an invitation which was quite acceptable; and as honest Jonathan had nothing to be ashamed of, it is probable that he was very frank in his communications to the civil draper, who, pursuing the benefit of the parish, hastened to make all the information he could gather about Freely common parochial property.You may imagine that the meeting of the Club at the Woolpack that evening was unusually lively.Every member was anxious to prove that he had never liked Freely, as he called himself.Faux was his name, was it?Fox would have been more suitable.The majority expressed a desire to see him hooted out of the town.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天，弗瑞利先生不敢迈出家门，因为他知道雅各布会紧跟在他身边，而且肯定会有一群年轻人跟着他们。他去定伍尔派克明天一早出发的马车，老板却没有把这件事当成秘密而守口如瓶。弗瑞利先生被告知七点才有马车，而格里姆沃斯的人都起得很早。也许在这个特别的早上，他们比平时更加警觉：雅各布手里攥着一包糖果，被弟弟戴维哄着一起上马车时，集市里所有人都从门窗向外望，街道转角处，还有一群学徒和学生朝着他们大喊大叫。雅各布还以为这些人是在表示友好，冲他们点点头，咧着嘴笑。“早啊，戴维·福克斯！你叔叔最近怎么样啊？”人们如此向他致以早安的问候。显而易见，这些尖刻的言辞是故意的。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Freely did not venture over his door-sill that day, for he knew Jacob would keep at his side, and there was every probability that they would have a train of juvenile followers.He sent to engage the Woolpack gig for an early hour the next morning; but this order was not kept religiously a secret by the landlord.Mr. Freely was informed that he could not have the gig till seven; and the Grimworth people were early risers.Perhaps they were more alert than usual on this particular morning; for when Jacob, with a bag of sweets in his hand, was induced to mount the gig with his brother David, the inhabitants of the market-place were looking out of their doors and windows, and at the turning of the street there was even a muster of apprentices and schoolboys, who shouted as they passed in what Jacob took to be a very merry and friendly way, nodding and grinning in return.“Huzzay, David Faux! how’s your uncle?” was their morning’s greeting.Like other pointed things, it was not altogether impromptu.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >众人的嘲弄对戴维来说还不算什么，他更害怕即使他今天成功把雅各布送回了家，也不敢保证他不会再回来，就像黄蜂会一直绕着蜜罐一样。一想到这里，戴维便一阵恐惧。只要还住格里姆沃斯，戴维就得担心雅各布再来找他。但是，之前他还陶醉在作为一个有钱的甜点商被众人羡慕的感觉中，现在却成为被众人嘲弄、被帕尔弗里一家嫌弃的对象，他还能在格里姆沃斯继续住下去吗？戴维喜欢被羡慕的感觉，他不在乎有没有人爱他。</td>
		<td class="en">Even this public derision was not so crushing to David as the horrible thought that though he might succeed now in getting Jacob home again there would never be any security against his coming back, like a wasp to the honey-pot.As long as David lived at Grimworth, Jacob’s return would be hanging over him.But could he go on living at Grimworth—an object of ridicule, discarded by the Palfreys, after having revelled in the consciousness that he was an envied and prosperous confectioner?David liked to be envied; he minded less about being loved.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快他的疑问就有了答案。格里姆沃斯的人开始强烈抵制他和他的食品，新学校快要建成了，餐室也关门了。且不说其他的原因，帕尔弗里家族是久居这个教区的体面家庭，单从对他们一家的同情心出发，所有体面的人家都已下定决心抵制弗瑞利的东西。再说，他还偷了他妈妈的几尼跑了：谁知道在来格里姆沃斯之前，比如在牙买加什么的地方他还干过什么事，是不是也隐藏了真实的身份去祸害其他家庭？女人们都感到不寒而栗。人们对他产生了各种可怕的怀疑：他那绿色的眼睛，他那罗圈腿都让人觉得他像个罪犯。教区牧师不想看到这个给他带来麻烦的人，所有买不起戴维商店里的东西的孩子在经过他的店时都会大声叫道：“戴维·福克斯！”显然，没人会再因弗瑞利先生的“善意”而再光顾他的店，他不得不放弃他的财产搬走，要知道这笔财产足以支付他的搬运费啊！</td>
		<td class="en">His doubts on this point were soon settled.The mind of Grimworth became obstinately set against him and his viands, and the new school being finished, the eating-room was closed.If there had been no other reason, sympathy with the Palfreys, that respectable family who had lived in the parish time out of mind, would have determined all well-to-do people to decline Freely’s goods.Besides, he had absconded with his mother’s guineas: who knew what else he had done, in Jamaica or elsewhere, before he came to Grimworth, worming himself into families under false pretences?Females shuddered.Dreadful suspicions gathered round him: his green eyes, his bow-legs had a criminal aspect.The rector disliked the sight of a man who had imposed upon him; and all boys who could not afford to purchase, hooted “David Faux” as they passed his shop.Certainly no man now would pay anything for the “goodwill” of Mr. Freely’s business, and he would be obliged to quit it without a peculium so desirable towards defraying the expense of moving.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几个月以后，这家商铺又一次要转让了，化名爱德华·弗瑞利先生的戴维·福克斯先生也离开了——格里姆沃斯没人知道他去了哪里。从这件事足以看出格里姆沃斯的妇女也一度堕落不堪。年轻的斯蒂恩夫人重新开始做馅饼，最后终于做出一炉非常美味的馅饼，斯蒂恩先生一边吃着一遍满足地看着她，还说这是他这辈子吃过最美味的馅饼。从这以后，她再也没想过诗人或是背教者。烹饪出佳肴的秘诀在主妇们的心里重新被唤起，女儿们则又开始迫切地想学到精湛的厨艺。</td>
		<td class="en">In a few months the shop in the market-place was again to let, and Mr. David Faux, alias Mr. Edward Freely, had gone—nobody at Grimworth knew whither.In this way the demoralization of Grimworth women was checked.Young Mrs. Steene renewed her efforts to make light mince-pies, and having at last made a batch so excellent that Mr. Steene looked at her with complacency as he ate them, and said they were the best he had ever eaten in his life, she thought less of bulbuls and renegades ever after.The secrets of the finer cookery were revived in the breasts of matronly house-wives, and daughters were again anxious to be initiated in them.</td></tr>
