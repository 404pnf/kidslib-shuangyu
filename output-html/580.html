		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >要讨论资本利润，我们有必要考虑调控租金起伏的准则；人们可以看到租金和利润彼此之间有着非常密切的联系。对于调控租金的准则，接下来会做简要说明。马尔萨斯先生在晚年所发表的一篇优秀作品中对这些准则做了充分、详实的阐释，对于这篇作品我内心充满了感激；但本文所讲述的准则同马尔萨斯先生所提出的略有不同。对于这些准则以及调控股本利润的准则，我做了认真的思考，我认为政府不应用法律政策来限制玉米的进口。从马尔萨斯先生发表的所有著作所提出的一般准则来看，我认为在利润和财富问题方面他所持的观点和我是一样的；但是在食物供应严重依赖国外所带来的巨大风险这个问题上，他认为从整体上限制进口是明智之举。我没有像他那样的担忧，或许由于我看到了廉价买进优质玉米的好处，因此我得出了一个与之不同的结论。其中某些反对意见促使他发表了自己的最后一篇论文《一个观点的根据》。我一直都在努力寻求这个问题的答案；但我认为这好像同他所理解的政治危机没有关联，也同有关自由贸易优势的普遍原则不一致。在自由贸易原则的建立上，他本人也通过著文立说做出了很大的贡献。</td>
		<td class="en">In treating on the subject of the profits of capital, it is necessary to consider the principles which regulate the rise and fall of rent; as rent and profits, it will be seen, have a very intimate connexion with each other. The principles which regulate rent are briefly stated in the following pages, and differ in a very slight degree from those which have been so fully and so ably developed by Mr Malthus in his late excellent publication, to which I am very much indebted. The consideration of those principles, together with those which regulate the profit of stock, have convinced me of the policy of leaving the importation of corn unrestricted by law. From the general principle set forth in al Mr Malthus's publications, I am persuaded that he holds the same opinion as far as profit and wealth are concerned with the question; — but, viewing, as he does, the danger as formidable of depending on foreign supply for a large portion of our food, he considers it wise, on the whole, to restrict importation. Not participating with him in those fears, and perhaps estimating the advantages of a cheap price of corn at a higher value, I have come to a different conclusion. Some of the objections urged in his last publication, — "Grounds of an Opinion," &c. I have endeavoured to answer; they appear to me unconnected with the political danger he apprehends, and to be inconsistent with the general doctrines of the advantages of a free trade, which he has himself, by his writings, so ably contributed to establish.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">ON THE INFLUENCE, etc.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马尔萨斯先生所下的定义非常准确，“地租就是偿付一切种植开销后，全部生产价值中依然属于业主的那部分价值。其中种植开销包括根据当前农业股的一般利润和普通利润来进行估算的资本利润。”</td>
		<td class="en">Mr Malthus very correctly defines, "the rent of land to be that portion of the value of the whole produce which remains to the owner, after all the outgoings belonging to its cultivation, of whatever kind, have been paid, including the profits of the capital employed, estimated according to the usual and ordinary rate of the profits of agricultural stock at the time being."</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，无论何时当农业股的一般利润和普通利润以及土地耕作的全部开销的总和等于全部生产的总价值时，就不会有租金。</td>
		<td class="en">Whenever, then, the usual and ordinary rate of the profits of agricultural stock, and all the outgoings belonging to the cultivation of land, are together equal to the value of the whole produce, there can be no rent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当全部生产产品的的价值只相当于必要的种植开销时，就既不会有租金也不会有利润。</td>
		<td class="en">And when the whole produce is only equal in value to the outgoings necessary to cultivation, there can neither be rent nor profit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个国家的广阔、肥沃的土地（这些土地可能会被任何欲占有之的人所占有）首次被开垦时，在扣除种植开销后的全部生产价值将是资本的利润，而且这部分价值属于资金的所有者，且不必扣除任何租金等费用。</td>
		<td class="en">In the first settling of a country rich in fertile land, and which may be had by any one who chooses to take it, the whole produce, after deducting the outgoings belonging to cultivation, will be the profits of capital, and will belong to the owner of such capital, without any deduction whatever for rent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，如果个人投资于土地上的资金相当于二百夸特小麦的价值（其中的一半由固定资本组成，如建筑场所、工具等等，另一半由流动资本组成）；如果取代固定资本和流动资本后，剩余生产产品的价值是一百夸特的小麦或相当于一百夸特小麦的价值，那么资本所有者的净利润将是百分之五十，即每二百的资本会收到一百的利润。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus, if the capital employed by an individual on such land were of the value of two hundred quarters of wheat, of which half consisted of fixed capital, such as buildings, implements, etc. and the other half of circulating capital, — if, after replacing the fixed and circulating capital, the value of the remaining produce were one hundred quarters of wheat, or of equal value with one hundred quarters of wheat, the neat profit to the owner of capital would be fifty per cent or one hundred profit on two hundred capital.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在一段时间内，土地保持肥沃，地理位置优越性不变，产量富足，后续的种植因而采取和首次投资同样的有利条件，这就使得农业股的利润率可能会持续保持在某一水平。随后的定居者也增多了。</td>
		<td class="en">For a period of some duration, the profits of agricultural stock might continue at the same rate, because land equally fertile, and equally well situated, might be abundant, and therefore, might be cultivated on the same advantageous terms, in proportion as the capital of the first, and subsequent settlers augmented.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于人口以高于资本增长的速度持续增加，所以利润甚至可能会上升，但工资却可能会下降。必要的流动资本可能不再是一百夸特小麦的价值，而是九十夸特。在这种情况下，股本的利润将会从50%上升到57%。</td>
		<td class="en">Profits might even increase, because the population increasing, at a more rapid rate than capital, wages might fall; and instead of the value of one hundred quarters of wheat being necessary for the circulating capital, ninety only might be required: in which case, the profits of stock would rise from fifty to fifty-seven per cent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >若农业或发展畜牧业的器具得到进一步发展，利润也可能会上法术连击升，并且这也可能会在不增加生产成本的基础上扩大生产。</td>
		<td class="en">Profits might also increase, because improvements might take place in agriculture, or in the implements of husbandry, which would augment the produce with the same cost of production.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果工资上涨，或实施的农业体制带来更为不利的后果，那么利润可能会再次下降。</td>
		<td class="en">If wages rose, or a worse system of agriculture were practised, profits would again fall.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上述情况一直都或多或少地存在于农业经营中。这些情况可能会延缓或促进财富增长的自然进程，因为这会提高或降低利润，或者会增加或减少粮食供给（但投资于土地的资金不会发生改变）。[^AnEssayonProfitsch-1]</td>
		<td class="en">These are circumstances which are more or less at all times in operation — they may retard or accelerate the natural effects of the progress of wealth, by rising or lowering profits — by increasing or diminishing the supply of food, with the employment of the same capital on the land.[^AnEssayonProfitsen-1]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，我们将假设农业不会得到任何改进，而资金和人口也会以适当的比例增长，因此劳动人员的实际工资将继续保持同样的水平；也许我们可能会知道资金的增加、人口的增长、种植面积向更边远地区的扩大以及不太肥沃的土地分别会带来什么样的效果。</td>
		<td class="en">We will, however, suppose that no improvements take place in agriculture, and that capital and population advance in the proper proportion, so that the real wages of labour, continue uniformly the same; — that we may know what peculiar effects are to be ascribed to the growth of capital, the increase of population, and the extension of cultivation, to the more remote, and less fertile land.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在当前社会，假如农业股的利润是50%，则其他资本的利润也将是50%——无论这些资本是投资于当前社会普遍存在的原始制造业，还是投资于对外贸易（一种换取所需的原材料产品的手段）。[^AnEssayonProfitsch-2]如果投资于贸易的资本的利润大于50%，投资于土地的资本将会被撤出，并转移到贸易上。反之，资本将会从贸易转移到农业。</td>
		<td class="en">In this state of society, when the profits on agricultural stock, by the supposition, are fifty per cent the profits on all other capital, employed either in the rude manufactures, common to such a stage of society, or in foreign commerce, as the means of procuring in exchange for raw produce, those commodities which may be in demand, will be also, fifty per cent.[^AnEssayonProfitsen-2] If the profits on capital employed in trade were more than fifty per cent capital would be withdrawn from the land to be employed in trade. If they were less, capital would be taken from trade to agriculture.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当周边所有肥沃的土地都被第一批定居者开发完之后，如果资本和人口仍在增加，这将需要更多的粮食，因此人们只能继续开发地理位置相对较差的土地。假设这些土地也同样肥沃，将需要雇用更多的劳动人员和马匹等，以将粮食从生产地运往消费市场，而这将需要长期注入更多的资金以保证同等的产量。假设额外注入的资金等于十夸特小麦的价值，在新开发的土地上所投入的全部资金将相当于二百一十夸特小麦的价值，以从中获得同之前相同的利润。而结果却是股本利润从50%降到45%（即二百一十夸特小麦价值的资本获得九十夸特小麦价值的利润）。[^AnEssayonProfitsch-3]</td>
		<td class="en">After all the fertile land in the immediate neighbourhood of the first settlers were cultivated, if capital and population increased, more food would be required, and it could only be procured from land not so advantageously situated. Supposing then the land to be equally fertile, the necessity of employing more labourers, horses, etc. to carry the produce from the place where it was grown, to the place where it was to be consumed, although no alteration were to take place in the wages of labour, would make it necessary that more capital should be permanently employed to obtain the same produce. Suppose this addition to be of the value of ten quarters of wheat, the whole capital employed on the new land would be two hundred and ten, to obtain the same return as on the old; and, consequently the profits of stock would fall from fifty to forty-three per cent or ninety on two hundred and ten.[^AnEssayonProfitsen-3]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在第一批开发的土地上所得到的回报将和之前相同，即50%的利润或一百夸特小麦的价值；然而，由从回报最少的农业投资中所得的利润所控制的股本中获取的总利润之中，有一百夸特将会被分配，其中43%即八十六夸特小麦的价值是股本利益，7%即14夸特小麦的价值是地租。假使资本所有者持有的相当于二百一十夸特小麦的价值的资本获得了刚好相同的利润，那么无论他是开发遥远地区的土地或者给第一批定居者支付十四夸特度的地租，上述这样的分配都必然会发生。</td>
		<td class="en">On the land first cultivated, the return would be the same as before, namely, fifty per cent or one hundred quarters of wheat; but, the general profits of stock being regulated by the profits made on the least profitable employment of capital on agriculture, a division of the one hundred quarters would take place, forty-three per cent or eighty-six quarters would constitute the profit of stock, and seven per cent or fourteen, quarters, would constitute rent. And that such a division must take place is evident, when we consider that the owner of the capital of the value of two hundred and ten quarters of wheat would obtain precisely the same profit, whether he cultivated the distant land, or paid the first settler fourteen quarters for rent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这一阶段，所有贸易投资的利润将会降到43%。</td>
		<td class="en">In this stage, the profits on, all capital employed in trade would fall to forty-three per cent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果，人口进一步增加，财富进一步累加，就需要有更多的土地能获得相同的利润，也许将有必要利用相当于二百二十夸特小麦的价值的资金（无论是由于地理位置还是土地质量较差的原因），而股本的利润将会降到36%（即二百二十夸特小麦价值的资本获得八十夸特小麦价值的利润），第一批土地的租金将上升到二十八夸特小麦的价值，而在第二批开发的土地上将开始缴纳租金，地租将会是十四夸特小麦的价值。</td>
		<td class="en">If, in the further progress of population and wealth, the produce of more land were required to obtain the same return, it might be necessary to employ, either on account of distance, or the worse qualIty of land, the value of two hundred and twenty quarters of wheat, the profits of stock would then fall to thirty-six per cent or eighty on two hundred and twenty, and the rent of the first land would rise to twenty-eight quarters of wheat, and on the second portion of land cultivated, rent would now commence, and would amount to fourteen quarters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所有交易资本的利润也将会下降到36%。</td>
		<td class="en">The profits on all trading capital would also fall to thirty-six per cent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，如果土地的质量持续下降或地理位置欠佳，之前所耕种的土地上的租金就会上涨，而利润也会以相同的比例下降。若微薄的利润得不到增长，这将很难限制租金的上涨以及利润的不断下降。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus by bringing successively land of a worse quality, or less favourably situated into cultivation, rent would rise on the land previously cultivated, and precisely in the same degree would profits fall; and if the smallness of profits do not check accumulation, there are hardly any limits to the rise of rent, and the fall of profit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果不在遥远的新土地上进行投资，而是将价值为二百一十夸特小麦的额外资本用于第一批开荒的土地上，其回报率同样也是43%，或90/210；第一资本所产生的50%的利润将会以之前的方式进行分配——即43%或86夸特是利润，14夸特是租金。</td>
		<td class="en">If instead of employing capital at a distance on new land, an additional capital of the value of two hundred and ten quarters of wheat be employed on the first land cultivated, and its return were in like manner forty-three per cent or ninety on two hundred and ten; the produce of fifty per cent on the first capital, would be divided in the same manner as before forty-three per cent or eighty-six quarters would constitute profit, and fourteen quarters rent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果额外利用了二百二十夸特，但成效却一样，那么第一资本要支付二十八夸特的租金；第二资本要支付十四夸特，所有六百三十夸特的资本所产生的利润将会是一样的，将达36%。</td>
		<td class="en">If two hundred and twenty quarters were employed in addition with the same result as before, the first capItal would afford a rent of twenty-eight; and the second of fourteen quarters, and the profits on the whole capital of six hundred and thirty quarters would be equal, and would amount to thirty-six per cent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >假设人的本性发生了巨大的改变，人类需要相当于目前食用量双倍的食物才能维持生存，那么耕种的成本将大大增加。在这种情况下，若一个旧式社会在一个新国家刚开发的肥沃的土地上投入了知识和资本，所产生的生产剩余将大大减少；因此，股本的利润绝不可能达如此之高。然而，虽然资本的积累比较缓慢，但可能仍在积累，而租金也会像之前——即更遥远或更贫瘠的土地被开发时——那样开始收取。</td>
		<td class="en">Supposing that the nature of man was so altered, that he required double the quantity of food that is now necessary for his subsistence, and consequently, that the expenses of cultivation were very greatly increased. Under such circumstances the knowledge and capital of an old society employed on fresh and fertile land in a new country would leave a much less surplus produce; consequently, the profits of stock could never be so high. But accumulation, though slower in its progress, might still go on, and rent would begin just as before, when more distant or less fertile land were cultivated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人口的自然限制当然要早得多，租金也不可能涨到现在这样的高度；因为，从事物的本质上而言，同样贫瘠的土地不可能被开发；——若要在更富饶的土地上进行投资并获得足够的利润回报，其所需的资金也不可能同在贫瘠土地上的投资额相同。[^AnEssayonProfitsch-4]</td>
		<td class="en">The natural limit to population would of course be much earlier, and rent could never rise to the height to which it may now do; because, in the nature of things, land of the same poor quality would never be brought into cultivation; — nor could the same amount of capital be employed on the better land with any adequate return of profit.[^AnEssayonProfitsen-4]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >根据上述计算，我们可以假设第一块土地在投入了二百夸特资本的基础上得到了一百夸特的利润，而第二块土地在投入二百一十夸特资本的基础上得到九十夸特的利润。下表即是根据这一假设制成的。[^AnEssayonProfitsch-5]从表中可以看出，在一个国家的发展过程中，土地的全部产量将会增长，而且在一定时期内，那一部分属于属于股本利润的产量以及属于租金的那部分产量也会增加；但在随后的时期，资本的每一次积累都将带来绝对利润，而且利润额将以适当的比例逐渐缩小，然而租金将一致上涨。从表中还可看出，股本持有者的收入将会减少，因为这时投入到土质各异的土地上的资本是一千三百五十夸特，而之前的投资是一千一百夸特。在前一情况下，全部利润将为二百七十夸特，后者的利润是二百七十五夸特；若投入的资本是一千六百一十夸特，利润将下降到二百四十一点五夸特。[^AnEssayonProfitsch-6]</td>
		<td class="en">The following table is constructed on the supposition, that the first portion of land yields one hundred quarters profit on a capital of two hundred quarters; the second portion, ninety quarters on two hundred and ten, according to the foregoing calculations.[^AnEssayonProfitsen-5]It will be seen that during the progress of a country the whole produce raised on its land will Increase, and for a certain time that part of the produce which belongs to the profits of stock, as well as that part which belongs to rent will increase; but that at a later period, every accumulation of capital will be attended with an absolute, as well as a proportionate diminution of profits, — though rents will uniformly increase. A less revenue, it will be seen, will be enjoyed by the owner of stock, when one thousand three hundred and fifty quarters are employed on the different qualities of land, than when one thousand one hundred were employed. In the former case the whole profits will be only two hundred and seventy, in the latter two hundred and seventy five; and when one thousand six hundred and ten are employed, profits will fall to two hundred and forty-one and a half.[^AnEssayonProfitsen-6]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是我对积累的影响的看法，这一积累过程非常奇怪，但我相信人们之前从未注意过这一点。</td>
		<td class="en">This is a view of the effects of accumulation which is exceedingly curious, and has, I believe, never before been noticed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从表中可以看出，在一个国家的发展过程中，租金不仅绝对持续增长，而且其增长的比率是同土地投资呈正比；因此，当投入的总资本是四百一十夸特时，租主得到的租金是3.5%；当总资本是一千一百一十三夸特时，租金是四分之一；当总资本是一千八百八十六夸特时，租金是百分之五十。租主不仅会得到大部分农产品，而且还持有较大的股份。</td>
		<td class="en">It will be seen by the table, that, in a progressive country, rent is not only absolutely increasing, but that it is also increasing in its ratio to the capital employed on the land; thus when four hundred and ten was the whole capital employed, the landlord obtained three and a half per cent; when one thousand one hundred-thirteen and a quarter per cent; and when one thousand eight hundred and eighty-sixteen and a half per cent.

It would be diminished by the whole difference of the money value of the corn consumed, — it would be augmented by the increased exchangeable value of all those commodities which would be exported in exchange for the corn imported.
