		<td class="en">by Jack London</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他是个年轻人，不过二十四五岁，骑在马上时，本应该有他那种年轻人随意自然的风度，然而他却如此警觉、紧张。他黑色的眼睛扫视着四周，观察着树的细枝和分枝的动静，小鸟就在上面来回跳跃。他从树木和丛林构成的变化图景中不断向前找寻，眼睛又总是回到两边的矮树丛上。他一边观察一边倾听，不过他一路静静地骑着马，只有远处隆隆的枪声传向西边。这枪声毫无变化地在他耳朵边响了好几个钟头了，只有声音停止才有可能引起他的注意。因为他手头有更紧要的任务。卡宾枪就横放在鞍头上。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a young man, not more than twenty-four or five, and he might have sat his horse with the careless grace of his youth had he not been so catlike and tense.His black eyes roved everywhere, catching the movements of twigs and branches where small birds hopped, questing ever onward through the changing vistas of trees and brush, and returning always to the clumps of undergrowth on either side.And as he watched, so did he listen, though he rode on in silence, save for the boom of heavy guns from far to the west.This had been sounding monotonously in his ears for hours, and only its cessation could have aroused his notice.For he had business closer to hand.Across his saddle-bow was balanced a carbine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他心里那根弦绷得太紧了，以至于一群鹌鹑突然从马鼻子底下飞过也吓了他一大跳，使得他立刻下意识地勒住马，拿出卡宾枪，几乎举到肩头。他不好意思地笑了笑，镇静了一下，接着往前骑。他太紧张，又太专心于自己必须完成的任务，汗水刺了眼也不去擦，也不去管，任汗水滚落到鼻子上，然后溅到前鞍上。骑兵帽的镶边也沾着未干的汗水。他身下的杂色马也是一样汗淋淋的。当时正是正午，热得让人喘不过气来。就连小鸟和松鼠也不敢呆在太阳底下，躲藏在了树中阴凉的隐蔽处。</td>
		<td class="en">So tensely was he strung, that a bunch of quail, exploding into flight from under his horse’s nose, startled him to such an extent that automatically, instantly, he had reined in and fetched the carbine halfway to his shoulder.He grinned sheepishly, recovered himself, and rode on.So tense was he, so bent upon the work he had to do, that the sweat stung his eyes unwiped, and unheeded rolled down his nose and spattered his saddle pommel.The band of his cavalryman’s hat was fresh-stained with sweat.The roan horse under him was likewise wet.It was high noon of a breathless day of heat.Even the birds and squirrels did not dare the sun, but sheltered in shady hiding places among the trees.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人和马身上都是树叶，并沾了黄色的花粉，因为与其说穿过这片空地是冒险，还不如说是命令。他们紧贴着灌木丛和树林行进。在穿过干燥的林间空地或是绵延的光秃秃的高地牧场之前，这个人总是会停下来，探出头仔细看看。他一路向北，虽然道路曲曲折折，但似乎正是在北方他才最能了解自己在找什么。他不是懦夫，但是他的勇气和平常的文明人是一样的，他盼望能活着，而不是死去。</td>
		<td class="en">Man and horse were littered with leaves and dusted with yellow pollen, for the open was ventured no more than was compulsory.They kept to the brush and trees, and invariably the man halted and peered out before crossing a dry glade or naked stretch of upland pasturage.He worked always to the north, though his way was devious, and it was from the north that he seemed most to apprehend that for which he was looking.He was no coward, but his courage was only that of the average civilized man, and he was looking to live, not die.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沿小山坡向上是条小路，灌木丛太密了，他不得不下来牵着马走。但当道路蜿蜒曲折绕向西方时，他就改道，又沿着长满橡树的山脊顶向北走去。</td>
		<td class="en">Up a small hillside he followed a cowpath through such dense scrub that he was forced to dismount and lead his horse.But when the path swung around to the west, he abandoned it and headed to the north again along the oak-covered top of the ridge.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >山脊尽头是个陡坡，坡太陡以至于他来来回回曲折地沿着坡面走，在枯叶乱藤中磕磕绊绊的，不是滑了一跤，就是绊了一脚。他戒备地盯着上面的马，它如果摔下来就会压到他身上。汗水从他身上流下来，花粉末落在嘴和鼻孔里，强烈地刺激着他，让他觉得更渴了。虽然他很努力，可是坡上太嘈杂了，所以他常常停下来，在干热的空气中喘着气，听听坡下有什么危险信号。</td>
		<td class="en">The ridge ended in a steep descent—so steep that he zigzagged back and forth across the face of the slope, sliding and stumbling among the dead leaves and matted vines and keeping a watchful eye on the horse above that threatened to fall down upon him.The sweat ran from him, and the pollen-dust, settling pungently in mouth and nostrils, increased his thirst.Try as he would, nevertheless the descent was noisy, and frequently he stopped, panting in the dry heat and listening for any warning from beneath.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了山坡下面，他走上一片平地，平地上的树林很茂密，他都分辨不出它有多大。这个树林的情形不一样，他可以再骑上马了。没了曲折山腰上的橡树，取而代之的是高大笔直的树木，树干很粗，郁郁葱葱，从潮湿肥沃的土壤里生长出来。只是到处有些灌木丛，他很容易就绕过了，他还碰到些蜿蜒曲折、像公园一般的空地。在战争把牛赶跑之前，它们在这片空地上吃草。</td>
		<td class="en">At the bottom he came out on a flat, so densely forested that he could not make out its extent.Here the character of the woods changed, and he was able to remount.Instead of the twisted hillside oaks, tall straight trees, big-trunked and prosperous, rose from the damp fat soil.Only here and there were thickets, easily avoided, while he encountered winding, park-like glades where the cattle had pastured in the days before war had run them off.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他现在的行进速度快多了，他走下山谷，过了半个钟头，在一片空地边上停了下来，停在年代久远的栅栏边。他可不喜欢空地的空旷，可是道路就从其中穿过，通到林子边上，那儿是小溪的堤岸。穿过空地只需走四分之一英里的路程，可是一想到要冒险走过去，他就觉得反感。一支来复枪——或者二十支，甚至一千支——可能埋伏在小溪边上。</td>
		<td class="en">His progress was more rapid now, as he came down into the valley, and at the end of half an hour he halted at an ancient rail fence on the edge of a clearing.He did not like the openness of it, yet his path lay across to the fringe of trees that marked the banks of the stream.It was a mere quarter of a mile across that open, but the thought of venturing out in it was repugnant.A rifle, a score of them, a thousand, might lurk in that fringe by the stream.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他两次试图动身，可是两次又都停了下来。自己孤身一人，他觉得惊恐。来自西方的战争的脉搏表明有几千人在一起战斗，可是这里什么也没有，只有静寂，只有他自己，还有可能会从无数的伏兵中射出的夺命的子弹。可他的任务就是发现自己害怕发现的东西。他必需一直向前，向前，直到在某时某地碰见从另一面来的另一个人或者几个人，他们和他一样也在侦查，要作汇报，就像他必须汇报和别人接过头一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Twice he essayed to start, and twice he paused.He was appalled by his own loneliness.The pulse of war that beat from the West suggested the companionship of battling thousands; here was naught but silence, and himself, and possible death-dealing bullets from a myriad ambushes.And yet his task was to find what he feared to find.He must on, and on, till somewhere, some time, he encountered another man, or other men, from the other side, scouting, as he was scouting, to make report, as he must make report, of having come in touch.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他改了主意，在林子里沿着边缘走了一段距离，然后又向前窥视。这次是在空地的正中央，他看到了一个小农舍。可是没有人生活的迹象。没有炊烟从烟囱里袅袅升起，谷仓前的空地里也没有家禽咯咯地叫，或是趾高气昂地走。厨房门敞开着，他费劲地对着黑洞一般的屋子凝视许久，似乎随时都会出现一个农妇似的。</td>
		<td class="en">Changing his mind, he skirted inside the woods for a distance, and again peeped forth.This time, in the middle of the clearing, he saw a small farmhouse.There were no signs of life.No smoke curled from the chimney, not a barnyard fowl clucked and strutted.The kitchen door stood open, and he gazed so long and hard into the black aperture that it seemed almost that a farmer’s wife must emerge at any moment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他舔舔干燥的嘴唇上的花粉和尘土，使身心坚强起来，就又骑进了炙热的阳光里。他没有引起任何骚动。他接着经过了农舍，走近河岸边如屏障一样的树林和灌木丛。脑海里总有一个想法，这令他发狂。他总想着一个高速行进的子弹冲进自己的身体。这让他感到非常脆弱、毫无防备，于是他低身蜷伏在马鞍上。</td>
		<td class="en">He licked the pollen and dust from his dry lips, stiffened himself, mind and body, and rode out into the blazing sunshine.Nothing stirred.He went on past the house, and approached the wall of trees and bushes by the river’s bank.One thought persisted maddeningly.It was of the crash into his body of a high-velocity bullet.It made him feel very fragile and defenseless, and he crouched lower in the saddle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >把马拴在林子边上，他走了一百来码，来到了小溪旁。小溪有二十英尺宽，看不到水的流动，溪水凉爽且诱人，而他非常渴。可是，他就在叶子形成的屏障里等待，眼睛盯着对面的屏障。为了等待的时候能好受些，他坐了下来，卡宾枪就搁在膝盖上。数分钟过去了，他紧绷的神经慢慢放松下来。最后，他断定没有危险。可正当他准备要离开灌木丛、弯下身子去喝水时，他注意到了对面灌木丛里的动静。</td>
		<td class="en">Tethering his horse in the edge of the wood, he continued a hundred yards on foot till he came to the stream.Twenty feet wide it was, without perceptible current, cool and inviting, and he was very thirsty.But he waited inside his screen of leafage, his eyes fixed on the screen on the opposite side.To make the wait endurable, he sat down, his carbine resting on his knees.The minutes passed, and slowly his tenseness relaxed.At last he decided there was no danger; but just as he prepared to part the bushes and bend down to the water, a movement among the opposite bushes caught his eye.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可能是只鸟。可是他等待着。灌木丛里又有一阵骚动，然后灌木丛分开了，一张脸露了出来。这张脸出现得如此突然，吓得他差点叫了出来。这张脸上长满了胡子——长了几个星期的姜黄色的胡子。他的眼睛蓝蓝的，分得很开，尽管一脸的疲惫和焦虑，可他还是笑了笑，眼角露出了皱纹。</td>
		<td class="en">It might be a bird.But he waited.Again there was an agitation of the bushes, and then, so suddenly that it almost startled a cry from him, the bushes parted and a face peered out.It was a face covered with several weeks’ growth of ginger-colored beard.The eyes were blue and wide apart, with laughter-wrinkles in the corners that showed despite the tired and anxious expression of the whole face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一切，他都看得很清楚，就像是在显微镜下一样，因为离他不到二十英尺远。一瞬间他就把这一切都看在了眼里，同时不忘把卡宾枪举到肩头。他顺着看过去，知道自己凝视的这个人和死人几乎差不多。如此近的距离他是不可能打偏的。</td>
		<td class="en">All this he could see with microscopic clearness, for the distance was no more than twenty feet.And all this he saw in such brief time, that he saw it as he lifted his carbine to his shoulder.He glanced along the sights, and knew that he was gazing upon a man who was as good as dead.It was impossible to miss at such point-blank range.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是他没有开枪。慢慢地他放下卡宾枪，观察着。他看见这个姜黄胡子的人一只手握着水壶，弯下身去灌水。他能听见潺潺的水流声。然后，那人的胳膊、水壶还有姜黄胡子消失在合上了的灌木丛后。他等了很久，还是非常口渴，然后他又爬上马，慢慢地穿过阳光照耀的空地，走进了远处树林的阴凉里。</td>
		<td class="en">But he did not shoot.Slowly he lowered the carbine and watched.A hand, clutching a water-bottle, became visible and the ginger beard bent downward to fill the bottle.He could hear the gurgle of the water.Then arm and bottle and ginger beard disappeared behind the closing bushes.A long time he waited, when, with thirst unslaked, he crept back to his horse, rode slowly across the sun-washed clearing, and passed into the shelter of the woods beyond.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >二</td>
		<td class="en">II</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >又一天，天热得令人喘不过气来。一个废弃的农舍立在空地上。农舍很大，有很多外屋，还有一个果园。一个年轻人骑在一匹杂色马上从树林里走出来，他有着敏锐的黑眼睛，卡宾枪就横在鞍头上。到达农舍时，他放松地舒了一口气。很明显，这个季节的早些时候，这里打了一仗。弹夹和空弹壳都因为铜锈而没了光泽，它们躺在地上，沾了潮气，让马蹄踩坏了。紧挨着菜园的是几个坟墓，都贴了标签并排了序号。厨房门旁边的橡树上挂着两具男人的尸体，他们的衣服经过风吹雨打已破旧不堪。脸干枯了，容貌毁坏了，已经不像是人的脸。杂色马在尸体下面喷着气，它的主人爱抚着它，使它平静，然后把它拴到远处。</td>
		<td class="en">Another day, hot and breathless.A deserted farmhouse, large, with many outbuildings and an orchard, standing in a clearing.From the woods, on a roan horse, carbine across pommel, rode the young man with the quick black eyes.He breathed with relief as he gained the house.That a fight had taken place here earlier in the season was evident.Clips and empty cartridges, tarnished with verdigris, lay on the ground, which, while wet, had been torn up by the hoofs of horses.Hard by the kitchen garden were graves, tagged and numbered.From the oak tree by the kitchen door, in tattered, weatherbeaten garments, hung the bodies of two men.The faces, shriveled and defaced, bore no likeness to the faces of men.The roan horse snorted beneath them, and the rider caressed and soothed it and tied it farther away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走到房子里面，他发现里面全被毁坏了。当他从一间屋子走到另一间，透过窗子来侦查时，脚踩到了空弹壳上。人们当初在这儿四处扎营、睡觉。在一间屋子的地板上，他偶然看到了污渍，那一定是受伤的人曾躺过的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Entering the house, he found the interior a wreck.He trod on empty cartridges as he walked from room to room to reconnoiter from the windows.Men had camped and slept everywhere, and on the floor of one room he came upon stains unmistakable where the wounded had been laid down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又走了出来，牵着马在谷仓后面转，闯进了果园。十几棵树上挂满了熟了的苹果。他把口袋都装满了，一边吃一边摘。接着他想起了什么，看了一眼太阳，估算了一下回营的时间。他脱下衬衫，把袖子扎起来做成了一个包。他接着就往里面装苹果。</td>
		<td class="en">Again outside, he led the horse around behind the barn and invaded the orchard.A dozen trees were burdened with ripe apples.He filled his pockets, eating while he picked.Then a thought came to him, and he glanced at the sun, calculating the time of his return to camp.He pulled off his shirt, tying the sleeves and making a bag.This he proceeded to fill with apples.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他正要骑上马，马却突然竖起了耳朵。他也听起来，隐隐约约地听见有马蹄重重地踩在松软的地上。他蹑手蹑脚地走到了谷仓的墙角，探出脑袋往外看。十几个人骑着马，松散地排成一行，从空地的对面骑了过来，也就是大约一百英尺那么远。他们向农舍骑过来了。有些人下了马，有些还坐在马鞍上，预示着他们不会久留。看上去他们在开会，因为他能听见他们在激烈地讨论，带着外来入侵者那种令人厌恶的声音。一段时间过去了，可是他们似乎还没能做出决定。他收好卡宾枪，把它放在枪套里，骑上马，很不耐烦地等待着，又稳了稳前鞍上那一衬衫的苹果。</td>
		<td class="en">As he was about to mount his horse, the animal suddenly pricked up its ears.The man, too, listened, and heard, faintly, the thud of hoofs on soft earth.He crept to the corner of the barn and peered out.A dozen mounted men, strung out loosely, approaching from the opposite side of the clearing, were only a matter of a hundred yards or so away.They rode on to the house.Some dismounted, while others remained in the saddle as an earnest that their stay would be short.They seemed to be holding a council, for he could hear them talking excitedly in the detested tongue of the alien invader.The time passed, but they seemed unable to reach a decision.He put the carbine away in its boot, mounted, and waited impatiently, balancing the shirt of apples on the pommel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到脚步声走近，他凶猛地把马刺扎在杂色马身上，马一惊，嘶鸣了一声就跃了出去。在谷仓的墙角，他看到了闯入者，只是个十九或二十岁的男孩，虽然也穿着制服。他往后跳了一步，以防止被撞倒。就在同一时刻，杂色马突然转弯，它的主人瞥见了房子旁边被惊起的人们。一些人从马上跳了起来，他能看见他们正把来复枪举到肩头。他经过了厨房门口和在树阴下晃动的干尸，迫使敌人从房子的前面绕过。一支来复枪响了，接着是第二支，可是他骑得飞快，身子前倾，矮矮地压在马鞍上，一只手抓着装苹果的衬衫，一只手控制着马。</td>
		<td class="en">He heard footsteps approaching, and drove his spurs so fiercely into the roan as to force a surprised groan from the animal as it leaped forward.At the corner of the barn he saw the intruder, a mere boy of nineteen or twenty for all of his uniform jump back to escape being run down.At the same moment the roan swerved and its rider caught a glimpse of the aroused men by the house.Some were springing from their horses, and he could see the rifles going to their shoulders.He passed the kitchen door and the dried corpses swinging in the shade, compelling his foes to run around the front of the house.A rifle cracked, and a second, but he was going fast, leaning forward, low in the saddle, one hand clutching the shirt of apples, the other guiding the horse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >栅栏的最高处有四英尺高，可他了解杂色马，伴随着零散的枪声，他驾着马全速跃了过去。正前方八百英尺处就是树林，杂色马迈着大步走着这段路。现在所有的人都在开枪。他们开枪的速度很快，他都听不见单独的枪声。一颗子弹穿过他的帽子，可他没感觉到，不过他知道另外有一颗子弹射穿了马鞍上的那些苹果。第三枪响起，他赶紧避开，把身子压得更低了。子弹射得很低，从马腿当中穿过射在石头上，又反射到空中，嗡嗡作响，就像一只让人难以置信的昆虫。</td>
		<td class="en">The top bar of the fence was four feet high, but he knew his roan and leaped it at full career to the accompaniment of several scattered shots.Eight hundred yards straight away were the woods, and the roan was covering the distance with mighty strides.Every man was now firing.They were pumping their guns so rapidly that he no longer heard individual shots.A bullet went through his hat, but he was unaware, though he did know when another tore through the apples on the pommel.And he winced and ducked even lower when a third bullet, fired low, struck a stone between his horse’s legs and ricochetted off through the air, buzzing and humming like some incredible insect.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随着弹仓变空，枪声渐弱，很快，便没有人射击了。年轻人得意洋洋。在惊人的枪林弹雨中，他竟然毫发未损。他朝后瞟了一眼。没错，他们弹仓空了。他能看见有几个人在装子弹。其他的人跑回农舍后边去骑自己的马。他回头看的时候，两个人已经上了马，他看见他们绕过墙角，正拼命地往前骑。同时，他看到有个人分明长着姜黄胡子，那个人跪在地上，平举枪管，冷静地准备着远距离射击。</td>
		<td class="en">The shots died down as the magazines were emptied, until, quickly, there was no more shooting.The young man was elated.Through that astonishing fusillade he had come unscathed.He glanced back.Yes, they had emptied their magazines.He could see several reloading.Others were running back behind the house for their horses.As he looked, two already mounted, came back into view around the corner, riding hard.And at the same moment, he saw the man with the unmistakable ginger beard kneel down on the ground, level his gun, and coolly take his time for the long shot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻人把马刺刺到马身上，身子压得极低，一边飞跑着，一边来回晃动着，扰乱对方瞄准的目标。对方还是没有开枪。马一蹿一蹿的，林子越来越近了。只有二百英尺远了，枪声依旧迟迟没有响起。</td>
		<td class="en">The young man threw his spurs into the horse, crouched very low, and swerved in his flight in order to distract the other’s aim.And still the shot did not come.With each jump of the horse, the woods sprang nearer.They were only two hundred yards away and still the shot was delayed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着他就听见了枪声，这是他听到的最后一声，因为从高高的马鞍上撞到地上之前，他就死掉了。他们在屋子那边看着，见他摔了下来，身子撞到地上时还弹了一下，红脸蛋一样的苹果一下子从他身上全滚了出来。他们没有料到苹果一下子滚了出来，哈哈大笑起来，称赞“姜黄胡子”的远距离射击，为他鼓起了掌。</td>
		<td class="en">And then he heard it, the last thing he was to hear, for he was dead ere he hit the ground in the long crashing fall from the saddle.And they, watching at the house, saw him fall, saw his body bounce when it struck the earth, and saw the burst of red-cheeked apples that rolled about him.They laughed at the unexpected eruption of apples, and clapped their hands in applause of the long shot by the man with the ginger beard.</td></tr>
