		<td class="en">我深刻了解这个城区的所有可能性。在这个城区、这个革命的策源地里，英雄、发明家、注重实际的科学家、无赖、坏蛋、德行和恶习鱼龙混杂，这一切都受到贫困的压制，因各种需要而喘不过气来，他们狂饮滥喝，烈酒耗尽了他们的精力。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >If you are to realize what this wedding was like you must know that I paid my charwoman, poor creature, four francs a month; for which sum she came every morning to make my bed, clean my shoes, brush my clothes, sweep the room, and make ready my breakfast, before going to her day’s work of turning the handle of a machine, at which hard drudgery she earned five-pence.</td>
		<td class="en">为了让您明白这个婚礼会办成什么排场，必须告诉您，我每月给这个可怜的女人四个法郎，她每天上午来给我收拾床铺、擦鞋、刷洗衣服、打扫房间、做早餐。她用余下的时间去操作一台机器干活。她这样辛苦劳作，每天也就挣五个便士。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Blindness intensified the expression of bitterness and sorrow in that grand face of his; the dead eyes were lighted up, as it were, by a thought within that broke forth like a burning flame, lit by one sole insatiable desire, written large in vigorous characters upon an arching brow scored across with as many lines as an old stone wall.</td>
		<td class="en">失明加深了他这张宽阔的脸盘上凄凉痛苦的神情；死气沉沉的双眼被像火焰一样喷薄而出的思想点亮了，它来源于独特的、持续不断的欲望，这欲望有力地镌刻在隆起的额角上，一道道皱纹有如一层层的古老墙壁，横穿额头。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">他的手指时起时落，出于机械的习惯，按着老旧的单簧片。即使时不时吹出一些乐队所谓的走音，他也不在乎，跳舞的人也不在乎，连这个意大利老人的两个同伴也没有发觉。我期望他是个意大利人，而他确实是意大利人。</td></tr>
