		<td class="en">不一会儿，他靠近两个姑娘。这两个姑娘在他前面，正要走出教堂的院子。他进入教堂时，她们正坐在中殿里，饶有兴味地观察了他的一举一动。之后她们一起走出教堂，便聊起了他。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">次月，一个月光皎洁的晚上，谢德拉克顺着一条长长的笔直大路朝东走出黑文普尔镇，一直走到郊区。那里地势较高，聚集了比较气派的房子——如果这个古老港口附近有称得上气派的东西的话——这时，他看到前方有一个身影，从那人回头张望的姿势来看，他觉得是埃米莉。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >For one thing, she was ambitious, and socially his position was hardly so good as her own, and there was always the chance of an attractive woman mating considerably above her.</td>
		<td class="en">首先，她有更高的追求，而他的社会地位却还不及她自己。漂亮的女人总是有机会嫁给地位比自己高得多的男士。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It had long been in her mind that she would not strongly object to give him back again to Emily if her friend felt so very badly about him.</td>

		<td class="en">这个时间，埃米莉的父亲向来不在家，埃米莉这天似乎也不在，因为没人回应登门拜访的乔安娜。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Customers came so seldom hither that a five minutes’ absence of the proprietor counted for little.</td>
		<td class="en">小店门可罗雀，不常有顾客光临，因此店主出去五分钟，也不打紧。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Joanna waited in the little shop, where Emily had tastefully set out—as women can—articles in themselves of slight value, so as to obscure the meagreness of the stock-in-trade; till she saw a figure pausing without the window apparently absorbed in the contemplation of the sixpenny books, packets of paper, and prints hung on a string.</td>
		<td class="en">埃米莉充分发挥女性的天赋，精心摆放了店里那些本身不甚值钱的商品，尽量掩盖东西本身的寒酸。乔安娜在小店里等着，突然看到一个人停在窗外，看上去正全神贯注地打量着六便士一本的廉价书籍、小捆纸和悬挂在细绳上的画片。</td></tr>
