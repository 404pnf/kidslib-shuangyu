		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >文艺复兴的历史结束于法国，我们随它从意大利来到卢瓦尔河畔之国的那些美丽城市。但从某种很重要的意义来说，文艺复兴也开始于法国。法国作家喜欢将意大利天才人物的作品与法国血统联系起来。他们告诉我们阿西西的圣·弗朗西斯不仅取了个法国式的名字，而且那些深刻影响他思想的骑士精神和罗曼蒂克爱情的全部概念也是来源于法国；还告诉我们薄伽丘是怎样借用法国古代讽刺性寓言诗，构想了他故事的框架；但丁如何明确地把巴黎归为微型画的发源地。法国作家总认为文艺复兴的概念开始于12世纪末13世纪初，存在于中世纪自身的局限之中——虽然伟大，其中为追求人类生活和人类心灵的一些努力却是落空了，之后在15世纪方才取得了成就。的确，现在，文艺复兴这个词不仅泛指15世纪出现的古典文化复兴（这也是这个词最初使用时的含义所指），而且是指整个错综复杂的运动，这时古典文化复兴只是其中的一个元素或表现。对我们来说，文艺复兴是一场包含多个方面但却各方面统一的运动的代名词。在这场运动中，他们感知到了对充满智慧的事物和丰富想象力本身的热爱，对用更自由、更美好的方式构想生活的渴望，文艺复兴促使那些感受到这种渴望的人去寻找一个又一个能带来这种智慧和想象之愉悦的方法，并指引他们不仅去发掘这种愉悦感受的古老且被遗忘的源泉，而且去预言其新来源——新的生活体验、新的诗歌主题和艺术形式。这种感觉在12世纪末13世纪初有一个巨大的迸发。在极少但令人欣喜的情况下，在尖顶的建筑上、在罗曼蒂克爱情的教义中，在普罗旺斯的诗歌里，到处可见的是中世纪的粗蛮之力变成了美妙芳醇。由此产生的对美妙芳醇的追求变成了文艺复兴中古典复苏的种子，推动着它不停地在古希腊世界里寻觅带来极致芳醇的源泉。在之后的漫长的真正黑暗时代，这种本能被碾得粉碎，无数智慧和想象之愉悦的源泉消失无踪。因此，这次迸发名副其实地被称为文艺复兴，也就是复活。</td>
		<td class="en">The history of the Renaissance ends in France, and carries us away from Italy to the beautiful cities of the country of the Loire. But it was in France also, in a very important sense, that the Renaissance had begun. French writers, who are fond of connecting the creations of Italian genius with a French origin, who tell us how Saint Francis of Assisi took not his name only, but all those notions of chivalry and romantic love which so deeply penetrated his thoughts, from a French source, how Boccaccio borrowed the outlines of his stories from the old French fabliaux, and how Dante himself expressly connects the origin of the art of miniature-painting with the city of Paris, have often dwelt on this notion of a Renaissance in the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century, a Renaissance within the limits of the middle age itself—a brilliant, but in part abortive effort to do for human life and the human mind what was afterwards done in the fifteenth. The word Renaissance, indeed, is now generally used to denote not merely the revival of classical antiquity which took place in the fifteenth century, and to which the word was first applied, but a whole complex movement, of which that revival of classical antiquity was but one element or symptom. For us the Renaissance is the name of a many-sided but yet united movement, in which the love of the things of the intellect and the imagination for their own sake, the desire for a more liberal and comely way of conceiving life, make themselves felt, urging those who experience this desire to search out first one and then another means of intellectual or imaginative enjoyment, and directing them not only to the discovery of old and forgotten sources of this enjoyment, but to the divination of fresh sources thereof—new experiences, new subjects of poetry, new forms of art. Of such feeling there was a great out break in the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the following century. Here and there, under rare and happy conditions, in pointed architecture, in the doc trines of romantic love, in the poetry of Provence, the rude strength of the middle age turns to sweetness; and the taste for sweetness generated there becomes the seed of the classical revival in it, prompting it constantly to seek after the springs of perfect sweetness in the Hellenic world. And coming after a long period in which this instinct had been crushed, that true “dark age”, in which so many sources of intellectual and imaginative enjoyment had actually disappeared, this outbreak is rightly called a Renaissance, a revival.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因人类思维狭隘性而总是对立的不同思维模式、情感模式、不同时期的风格、不同艺术和诗歌形式由理论联系在一起，这些理论对当时的知识界有着极大的刺激，并几乎总是值得人们去理解。中世纪文艺复兴的理论正是如此：寻求在夏尔特尔的雕塑和勒芒的窗等那个时期最具代表性的作品，和后期文艺复兴中让·古尚、热尔曼·皮隆的作品之间建立一种连续性，以此来弥合通常被人们过分夸大的中世纪和文艺复兴间的裂痕。但法国作家们谈及中世纪文艺复兴时所指的，很大程度上不是中世纪的宗教艺术，如雕塑和绘画——这些作品本身尽管在很大程度上是为愉悦而创作，却经常会反映出世俗和叛逆的精神——而是那些世俗的普罗旺斯诗歌以及随后其在意大利和法国的繁荣兴起。在那些诗歌中，世俗的激情带着亲密、自由和它的变体——心灵的自由——使诗歌本身被感知。阿伯拉尔这位伟大的学者和伟大的情人的名字，把这种心灵自由的表达和所有可以体现人类智慧的主题的表达，与那个时代所理解的理性的自由结合在一起。</td>
		<td class="en">Theories which bring into connection with each other modes of thought and feeling, periods of taste, forms of art and poetry, which the narrowness of men’s minds constantly tends to oppose to each other, have a great stimulus for the intellect, and are almost always worth understanding. It is so with this theory of a Renaissance within the middle age, which seeks to establish a continuity between the most characteristic work of that period, the sculpture of Chartres, the windows of Le Mans, and the work of the later Renaissance, the work of Jean Cousin and Germain Pilon, thus healing that rupture between the middle age and the Renaissance which has so often been exaggerated. But it is not so much the ecclesiastical art of the middle age, its sculpture and painting—work certainly done in a great measure for pleasure’s sake, in which even a secular, a rebellious spirit often betrays itself—but rather its profane poetry, the poetry of Provence, and the magnificent after-growth of that poetry in Italy and France, which those French writers have in view when they speak of this medieval Renaissance. In that poetry, earthly passion, with its intimacy, its freedom, its variety—the liberty of the heart—makes itself felt; and the name of Abelard1, the great scholar and the great lover, connects the expression of this liberty of heart with the free play of human intelligence around all subjects presented to it, with the liberty of the intellect, as that age under stood it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大家都知道阿伯拉尔的传奇，他的传奇有着强烈的感情和典型的中世纪特色，毫不逊色于汤豪泽的传奇。这位著名牧师面目俊秀、沉着、亲切、谨慎，仿佛智慧本身即是其主宰。他来到巴黎圣母院，在大教士的房中住下。埃洛伊兹住在那里，据说她是老牧师的侄女，父母双亡。老牧师非常疼爱埃洛伊兹，让她接受最好的教育。有传言说，通过对多种语言的掌握，埃洛伊兹能够解读古老世界的神秘事物，成为凯尔特女巫师那样的魔法师。阿伯拉尔和埃洛伊兹在家里坐在一起，进一步研究某些抽象概念的本质，“爱与他们相伴”。想象一下这位学者当时身处的诱惑吧：沉浸于如梦如幻的宁静中，感受着明丽熙攘的西岱岛的美丽景致，置身于一个幻影般的世界里，对这个深知如何给每个抽象思想以确切价值的学者来说，对别人良心的束缚在他这里却是松懈的。似乎阿伯拉尔用白话文创作了很多诗歌：修道院外码头上那些年轻人都开始把它们唱出来了。M. 德·雷米萨说，那些诗歌可能代表行吟诗人的风格取向，“他是有记载的最早的一位，可以说是先驱”。同样的精神造就了以高雅的中世纪拉丁文创作的著名书信体诗歌。</td>
		<td class="en">Everyone knows the legend of Abelard, a legend hardly less passionate, certainly not less characteristic of the middle age, than the legend of Tannhäuser2; how the famous and comely clerk, in whom Wisdom herself, self-possessed, pleasant, and discreet, seemed to sit enthroned, came to live in the house of a canon of the church of Notre-Dame, where dwelt a girl, Heloïse, believed to be the old priest’s orphan niece; how the old priest had testified his love for her by giving her an education then unrivalled, so that rumor asserted that, through the knowledge of languages, enabling her to penetrate into the mysteries of the older world, she had become a sorceress, like the Celtic druidesses; and how as Abelard and Heloïse sat together at home there, to refine a little further on the nature of abstract ideas, “Love made himself of the party with them.” You conceive the temptations of the scholar, who, in such dreamy tranquility, amid the bright and busy spectacle of the “Island,” lived in a world of something like shadows; and that for one who knew so well how to assign its exact value to every abstract thought, those restraints which lie on the consciences of other men had been relaxed. It appears that he composed many verses in the vulgar tongue: already the young men sang them on the quay below the house. Those songs, says M. de Rémusat, were probably in the taste of the Trouvères, “of whom he was one of the first in date, or, so to speak, the predecessor.” It is the same spirit which has molded the famous a “letters”, written in the quaint Latin of the middle age.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后人为了使阿伯拉尔学派辖区优雅化，在“圣热讷维耶沃山”上建了哥特式尖塔。在这个早期的尖塔下面，历史学家米歇尔认为这是“一个可怕的集会——因为它不单单包含了阿伯拉尔的追随者，50位主教、20位红衣主教、两位教皇和整个经院哲学的所有成员；不仅仅囊括学识广博的埃洛伊兹、各种语言的教授和文艺复兴，而且还有布雷西亚的阿诺德——也就是说，还有革命。”从塞纳河边幽暗修道院的房间开始，我们看到这种精神向外传播。这种精神的品质已经得到严密定义，它的亲密、它倦怠的芳醇、它的离经叛道、它对人类情感的巧妙划分、它对躯体美的关注以及它对身体的崇拜贯穿了意大利的早期文学，甚至在但丁的诗歌中也能寻到影子。</td>
		<td class="en">At the foot of that early Gothic tower, which the next generation raised to grace the precincts of Abe lard’s school, on the “Mountain of Saint Geneviève,” the historian Michelet sees in thought “a terrible assembly; not the hearers of Abelard alone, fifty bishops, twenty cardinals, two popes, the whole body of scholastic philosophy; not only the learned Heloïse, the teaching of languages, and the Renaissance; but Arnold3 of Brescia—that is to say, the revolution.” And so from the rooms of this shadowy house by the Seine side we see that spirit going abroad, with its qualities already well defined, its intimacy, its languid sweetness, its rebellion, its subtle skill in dividing the elements of human passion, its care for physical beauty, its worship of the body, which penetrated the early literature of Italy, and finds an echo even in Dante.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对但丁的读者来说，《神曲》中未提及阿伯拉尔似乎仅仅是个疏忽，因为但丁似乎会把所有对他来说印象深刻的、色彩鲜明的或是具有重要精神意义的事情组织到自己的作品中，这些事情都是有史料记载的真实生活。在但丁所有伟大的诗篇中都见不到阿伯拉尔的名字，也很难找到有关在哲学史上留下浓重一笔的阿伯拉尔的暗示。而但丁本人曾热衷学习哲学。在巴黎拉丁区逗留时，他从巴黎大学讲学的学者和老师那里，几乎不可能没听到过阿伯拉尔。我们只能认为但丁确实考虑过阿伯拉尔和关于他的故事，但最终避免在“最终审判”框架中对他的评判“永恒正义”框架下对阿伯拉尔地位的批判。</td>
		<td class="en">That Abelard is not mentioned in the Divine Comedy may appear a singular omission to the reader of Dante, who seems to have inwoven into the texture of his work whatever had impressed him as either effective in color or spiritually significant among the recorded incidents of actual life. Nowhere in his great poem do we find the name, nor so much as an allusion to the story of one who had left so deep a mark on the philosophy of which Dante was an eager student, of whom in the Latin Quarter, and from the lips of scholar or teacher in the University of Paris, during his sojourn among them, he can hardly have failed to hear. We can only suppose that he had indeed considered the story and the man, and abstained from passing judgment as to his place in the scheme of “eternal justice.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在著名的汤豪泽传奇中，这位犯下大错的骑士一路走向罗马这个基督教中心寻求赦免。“立刻，”教皇想道，“只要他的手杖发芽开花，汤豪泽的灵魂就会立刻得救，马上得救。”不久教皇手中的干木手杖便为绿叶鲜花所覆盖。同样，在哥斯托的修道院里有一棵石化的树，修女们说她们当中死去的美丽的罗莎蒙德曾说过，那棵生机勃勃的绿树在她得救的时候会变成石头。跟汤豪泽一样，阿伯拉尔在去罗马的旅途中死去。没人知道如果他活着到达这次旅行的终点会发生些什么，他和那个时代的普遍信仰之间的关系也永远地处于这种模糊之中。正如在其他事情中一样，他预示了文艺复兴的特点：在这场运动中，人类心灵以各种方式为自己赢得了知觉、情感和思想的新领地，不是与当时存在的精神体系相对立，而是超出和独立在这个范围之外。阿伯拉尔投身于对立面，这使他的事业平添了异样色彩，也撕裂了他的灵魂。这种对立，跟体系内单是专职的、正式的、被雇佣来、但对体系自身盲目崇拜的牧师们与真正具备理性、情感和迅速感知能力这些牧师们已经丧失了的能力的光明之子——人文主义者之间的对立如出一辙。阿伯拉尔向宗教体系之外探求，在体系规定的界限外获得了理想的生活模式，虽然这种生活模式最初的萌芽可能也蕴含在体系本身之中。事实往往是这样：贫瘠狭隘文化的拥护者，因为他不能了解比自己更富有、更丰富的文化，所以对这些文化也毫不同情。——就像发现小麦之后他们仍以橡果为生（法语），也乐意听说别人制造的工具对高层次的人类需求毫无用处。</td>
		<td class="en">In the famous legend of Tannhäuser, the erring knight makes his way to Rome, to seek absolution at the centre of Christian religion. “So soon,” thought and said the Pope, “as the staff in his hand should bud and blossom, so soon might the soul of Tannhäuser be saved, and no sooner”; and it came to pass not long after that the dry wood of a staff which the Pope had carried in his hand was covered with leaves and flowers. So, in the cloister of Godstow, a petrified tree was shown of which the nuns told that the fair Rosamond, who had died among them, had declared that, the tree being then alive and green, it would be changed into stone at the hour of her salvation. When Abelard died, like Tannhäuser, he was on his way to Rome. What might have happened had he reached his journey’s end is uncertain; and it is in this uncertain twilight that his relation to the general beliefs of his age has always remained. In this, as in other things, he prefigures the character of the Renaissance, that movement in which, in various ways, the human mind wins for itself a new kingdom of feeling and sensation and thought, not opposed to but only beyond and independent of the spiritual sys tem then actually realised. The opposition into which Abelard is thrown, which gives its color to his career, which breaks his soul to pieces, is a no less subtle op position than that between the merely professional, official, hireling ministers of that system, with their ignorant worship of system for its own sake, and the true child of light, the humanist, with reason and heart and senses quick, while theirs were almost dead. He reaches out towards, he attains, modes of ideal living, beyond the prescribed limits of that system, though in essential germ, it may be, contained within it. As always hap pens, the adherents of the poorer and narrower culture had no sympathy with, because no understanding of, a culture richer and more ample than their own. After the discovery of wheat they would still live upon acorns—après l’invention du blé voulaient encore vivre du gland; and would hear of no service to the higher needs of humanity with instruments not of their forging.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，由于这些需求而变得勇敢无畏的人类精神对他们来说过于强大了。阿伯拉尔和埃洛伊兹用中世纪的拉丁文写下他们的书信，这些书信中他们内心的激情奔涌而出；尽管阿伯拉尔用白话文创作诗歌，但他也用拉丁文撰写专著论文，努力在哲学的抽象之中找到现实的基础，就像一个专注于用人类经验来检验事物一致性的人那样，阿伯拉尔触摸埃洛伊兹的手，看着她的双眼，从她伟大且充满活力的本性中寻找人性的本源。然而只是稍晚一些，也就是13世纪早期，法国散文传奇开始流行。在埃尔塞维尔图书馆馆藏的装帧精美的一卷中可以找到一些最为耀眼的片段，这些片段均已用心编辑。《阿米和阿米莱之友谊》是这些13世纪故事中的一篇，它是对人类情感的自由表达，对宣称阿伯拉尔的故事是一种主张的自由表达。这种表达在那种伟大友谊，那种纯洁、高尚友谊的事件中体现出来。这种友谊被推向一种热情四射的狂喜，甚至胜于至死不渝。虽然这样互相支持的伟大友谊随处可见，但它仍然特别是一个古典的主题。乔叟在一个古老的传说里充分表达了这种情感，人们不知道帕拉蒙和阿赛特对埃米莉亚的爱，还有他们两人之间的友爱，哪个是《骑士传奇》的主题——</td>
		<td class="en">But the human spirit, bold through those needs, was too strong for them. Abelard and Heloïse write their letters—letters with a wonderful outpouring of soul—in medieval Latin; and Abelard, though he composes songs in the vulgar tongue, writes also in Latin those treatises in which he tries to find a ground of reality below the abstractions of philosophy, as one bent on trying all things by their congruity with human experience, who had felt the hand of Heloïse, and looked into her eyes, and tested the resources of humanity in her great and energetic nature. Yet it is only a little later, early in the thirteenth century, that French prose romance begins; and in one of the pretty volumes of the Bibliothèque Elzevirienne some of the most striking fragments of it may be found, edited with much intelligence. In one of these thirteenth-century stories, Li Amitiez de Ami et Amile, that free play of human affection, of the claims of which Abelard’s story is an assertion, makes itself felt in the incidents of a great friendship, a friendship pure and generous, pushed to a sort of passionate exaltation, and more than faithful unto death. Such comradeship, though instances of it are to be found everywhere, is still especially a classical motive; Chaucer expressing the sentiment of it so strongly in an antique tale, that one knows not whether the love of both Palamon and Arcite for Emelya, or of those two for each other, is the chiefer subject of the Knight’s Tale—</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The friendship of Amis and Amile is deepened by the romantic circumstance of an entire personal resemblance between the two heroes, through which they pass for each other again and again, and thereby into many strange adventures; that curious interest of the Doppelgänger4, which begins among the stars with the Dioscuri5, being entwined in and out through all the incidents of the story, like an outward token of the inward similitude of their souls. With this, again, is connected, like a second reflection of that inward similitude, the conceit of two marvelously beautiful cups, also exactly like each other—children’s cups, of wood, but adorned with gold and precious stones. These two cups, which by their resemblance help to bring the friends together at critical moments, were given to them by the Pope, when he baptised them at Rome, whither the parents had taken them for that purpose, in gratitude for their birth. They cross and recross very strangely in the narrative, serving the two heroes almost like living things, and with that well-known effect of a beautiful object, kept constantly before the eye in a story or poem, of keeping sensation well awake, and giving a certain air of refinement to all the scenes into which it enters. That sense of fate, which hangs so much of the shaping of human life on trivial objects, like Othello’s strawberry handkerchief, is thereby heightened, while witness is borne to the enjoyment of beautiful handiwork by primitive people, their simple wonder at it, so that they give it an oddly significant place among the factors of a human history.</td></tr>

And when the servant had done as he was commanded, he returned and said, Sir, if I had not thy cup in my hand, I should believe that the cup which the sick man has was thine, for they are alike, the one to the other, in height and fashion. And Amile said, Go quickly and bring him to me. And when Amis stood before his comrade Amile demanded of him who he was, and how he had gotten that cup. I am of Briquain le Chastel, answered Amis, and the cup was given to me by the Bishop of Rome, who baptised me. And when Amile heard that, he knew that it was his comrade Amis, who had delivered him from death, and won for him the daughter of the King of France to be his wife. And straightway he fell upon him, and began weeping greatly, and kissed him. And when his wife heard that, she ran out with her hair in disarray, weeping and distressed exceedingly, for she remembered that it was he who had slain the false Ardres.

And Amile was greatly disturbed at those words, and said, I would have given to thee my man-servants and my maid-servants and all my goods, and thou feignest that an angel hath spoken to thee that I should slay my two children. And immediately Amis began to weep, and said, I know that I have spoken to thee a terrible thing, but constrained thereto; I pray thee cast me not away from the she1ter of thy house. And Amile answered that what he had covenanted with him, that he would perform, unto the hour of his death: But I conjure thee, said he, by the faith which there is between me and thee, and by our comradeship, and by the baptism we received together at Rome, that thou tell me whether it was man or angel said that to thee. And Amis answered again, So truly as an angel hath spoken to me this night, so may God deliver me from my infirmity!</td></tr>

W. 鲍迪伦编辑翻译成英文版，具有很典雅的学术气息。最近，独具匠心多才多艺的诗人安德鲁·朗又对它进行了翻译。读者也可以参考弗农·李所著的饶有趣味的《欧福良：中世纪文艺复兴和古典研究》中“户外诗歌”的有关篇章，这本书对所探讨的主题提供了丰富的知识和深刻的见解。——作者注）这本书并未因其中只包含一个在各民族间流传的传统主题的批判而丧失任何趣味性；因为，虽然经历了代代相传，这一主题的轮廓依然清晰，外表也一样光泽依旧。同其他中世纪的故事、书籍、文学和艺术概念一样，它也以这种方式获得了一种个性化的历史，这段历史几乎和书中主人公的经历一样，充满了危险和冒险。作者自己把这一篇称作民间叙事传奇。这种传奇是散文的形式，只是以不规则地穿插进诗歌的方式表现事件和情感。故事本身在衔接处有些粗糙的痕迹，也表现出缺乏技巧，让人们怀疑散文的作用只是将一系列诗歌连接在一起。这些诗歌极为动人，极为引人入胜，人们都希望通过一个规则的框架或结构来使它们具有更高、更尊贵的影响。然而这些诗歌本身极为简单，甚至都不押韵。它们只是采用不够完美的类韵，每节有20行或30行，以相似的元音结尾。正如其他早期诗歌一样，这里的兴趣主要在于新的艺术感觉的形成这幅壮美图景上。一种新的艺术正在兴起。那些押韵诗歌的韵律，还有《奥卡森与尼克莱特》中那些诗歌，好像一直在成为真正押韵的转折点上，但不知为何停顿下来，永远无法恰到好处。你可以看到人们越来越注意到拥有的新韵律元素，而且对于这种韵律能够变得多么美好满怀期待。</td>
		<td class="en">The central love-poetry of Provence, the poetry of the Tenson and the Aubade, of Bernard de Ventadour and Pierre Vidal, is poetry for the few, for the elect and peculiar people of the kingdom of sentiment. But below this intenser poetry there was probably a wide range of literature, less serious and elevated, reaching, by lightness of form and comparative homeliness of interest, an audience which the concentrated passion of those higher lyrics left untouched. This literature has long since perished, or lives only in later French or Italian versions. One such version, the only representative of its species, M. Faurie1 thought he detected in the story of Aucassin and Nicolette, written in the French of the latter half of the thirteenth century, and preserved in a unique manuscript, in the national library of Paris; and there were reasons which made him divine for it a still more ancient ancestry, traces in it of an Arabian origin, as in a leaf lost out of some early Arabian Nights . (Recently, Aucassin and Nicolette has been edited and translated into English, with much graceful scholarship, by Mr. F. W. Bourdillon. Still more recently we have had a translation—a poet’s translation—from the ingenious and versatile pen of Mr. Andrew Lang. The reader should consult also the chapter on “The Out-door Poetry,” in Vernon Lee’s most interesting Euphorion; being Studies of the Antique and Mediaeval in the Renaissance, a work abounding in knowledge and insight on the subjects of which it treats.) The little book loses none of its interest through the criticism which finds in it only a traditional subject, handed on by one people to another; for after passing thus from hand to hand, its outline is still clear, its surface untarnished; and, like many other stories, books, literary and artistic conceptions of the middle age, it has come to have in this way a sort of personal history, almost as full of risk and adventure as that of its own heroes. The writer himself calls the piece a cantefable, a tale told in prose, but with its incidents and sentiment helped forward by songs, inserted at irregular intervals. In the junctions of the story itself there are signs of roughness and want of skill, which make one suspect that the prose was only put together to connect a series of songs—a series of songs so moving and attractive that people wished to heighten and dignify their effect by a regular framework or setting. Yet the songs themselves are of the simplest kind, not rhymed even, but only imperfectly assonant, stanzas of twenty or thirty lines apiece, all ending with a similar vowel sound. And here, as elsewhere in that early poetry, much of the interest lies in the spectacle of the formation of a new artistic sense. A novel art is arising, the music of rhymed poetry, and in the songs of Aucassin and Nicolette , which seem always on the point of passing into true rhyme, but which halt some-how, and can never quite take flight, you see people just growing aware of the elements of a new music in their possession, and anticipating how pleasant such music might become.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The piece was probably intended to be recited by a company of trained performers, many of whom, at least for the lesser parts, were probably children. The songs are introduced by the rubric, Or se cante (ici on chante); and each division of prose by the rubric, Or dient et con tent et fabloient (ici on conte). The musical notes of a portion of the songs have been preserved; and some of the details are so descriptive that they suggested to M. Fauriel the notion that the words had been accompanied throughout by dramatic action. That mixture of simplicity and refinement which he was surprised to find in a composition of the thirteenth century, is shown sometimes in the turn given to some passing expression or remark; thus, “the Count de Garins was old and frail, his time was over”—Li quens Garins de Beaucaire estoit vix et frales; si avoit son tans trespassè. And then, all is so realised! One sees the ancient forest, with its dis used roads grown deep with grass, and the place where seven roads meet—u a forkeut set cemin qui s’en vont par le païs, we hear the light-hearted country people calling each other by their rustic names, and putting for ward, as their spokesman, one among them who is more eloquent and ready than the rest—li un qui plus fu en parlés des autres; for the little book has its burlesque element also, so that one hears the faint, far-off laughter still. Rough as it is, the piece certainly possesses this high quality of poetry, that it aims at a purely artistic effect. Its subject is a great sorrow, yet it claims to be a thing of joy and refreshment, to be entertained not for its matter only, but chiefly for its manner, it is cortois, it tells us, et bien assis.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于风格的研究者，以及古法语和法国文学的学生来说，它很有纯古物研究的趣味。说一篇古代文学作品具备古物研究的意义，通常意味着它对当今的读者来说没有独特的美学价值。古物研究通过纯粹的历史研究，正确地透视客体，把读者定位于在过去能带来愉快的东西对当今读者产生同样效果的观点中，因此古物研究可能常常在很大程度上增加了我们从古典文学中获得的魅力。但这种促进的先决条件必须是事物本身具有真实直接的美学魅力。只有具备这种魅力，只有一些纯粹的艺术特质存在于它最初的构成中，古文物研究才能成就它的审美价值，或者使它成为一个合适的审美批评主题。不论这种特质存在于哪里，将其界定，把它和一部古老戏剧或故事由于真正古物研究而很可能获得的、某些借来的趣味区别开来总是令人愉悦的。奥卡森与尼克莱特的故事也具备这样的特质，奥卡森是博凯尔的德加林伯爵的独生子，他热切地爱上了尼克莱特。美丽动人却出身不明的尼克莱特是阿拉伯人买来的。奥卡森的父亲不准他和尼克莱特结婚。故事铺陈描述这对恋人的冒险之旅，直到故事最后两个人对彼此的忠诚终于获得了回报。这些冒险是最为简单不过的冒险，好像是专为吸引那些外在的、想象的目光而选择的；这些目光专注于一些赏心悦目的事物上，比如说一个花园，一个荒废的高塔，还有尼克莱特从敌人那里逃出来后，在森林里盖起的、告诉奥卡森她由此经过的小花房。这个故事所有的魅力都在它的细节中，在其加诸情感的情境和特性上的特殊的轻盈优雅的转承中，尤其是在早期法国散文怪异的零散作品中多有体现。</td>
		<td class="en">For the student of manners, and of the old French language and literature, it has much interest of a purely antiquarian order. To say of an ancient literary com position that it has an antiquarian interest, often means that it has no distinct aesthetic interest for the reader of to-day. Antiquarianism, by a purely historical effort, by putting its object in perspective, and setting the reader in a certain point of view, from which what gave pleasure to the past is pleasurable for him also, may often add greatly to the charm we receive from ancient literature. But the first condition of such aid must be a real, direct, aesthetic charm in the thing itself. Unless it has that charm, unless some purely artistic quality went to its original making, no merely antiquarian effort can ever give it an aesthetic value, or make it a proper subject of aesthetic criticism. This quality, wherever it exists, it is always pleasant to define, and discriminate from the sort of borrowed interest which an old play, or an old story, may very likely acquire through a true antiquarianism. The story of Aucassin and Nicolette has something of this quality. Aucassin, the only son of Court Garins of Beaucaire, is passionately in love with Nicolette, a beautiful girl of unknown parentage, bought of the Saracens, whom his father will not permit him to marry. The story turns on the adventures of these two lovers, until at the end of the piece their mutual fidelity is rewarded. These adventures are of the simplest sort, adventures which seem to be chosen for the happy occasion they afford of keeping the eye of the fancy, perhaps the outward eye, fixed on pleasant objects, a gar-den, a ruined tower, the little hut of flowers which Nicolette constructs in the forest whither she escapes from her enemies, as a token to Aucassin that she has passed that way. All the charm of the piece is in its details, in a turn of peculiar lightness and grace given to the situations and traits of sentiment, especially in its quaint fragments of early French prose.</td></tr>

There is a languid Eastern deliciousness in the very scenery of the story, the full-blown roses, the chamber painted in some mysterious manner where Nicolette is imprisoned, the cool brown marble, the almost nameless colors, the odors of plucked grass and flowers. Nicolette herself well becomes this scenery, and is the best illustration of the quality I mean—the beautiful, weird, foreign girl, whom the shepherds take for a fay, who has the knowledge of simples, the healing and beautifying qualities of leaves and flowers, whose skilful touch heals Aucassin’s sprained shoulder, so that he suddenly leaps from the ground; the mere sight of whose white flesh, as she passed the place where he lay, healed a pilgrim stricken with sore disease, so that he rose up, and re turned to his own country.

Let me gather up these morsels of deeper color, these expressions of the ideal intensity of love, the motive which really unites together the fragments of the little composition. Dante, the perfect flower of ideal love, has recorded how the tyranny of that “Lord of terrible aspect” became actually physical, blinding his senses, and suspending his bodily forces.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个被我称为中世纪文艺复兴的理性和想象力的勃发，以及中世纪心灵自由主张的最显著特点之一就是反律法主义，那种对当时的道德和宗教观点的反叛精神。在寻找感官和想象快乐的过程中，在对美的关注里，在对身体的崇拜下，人们被推动去摆脱基督教理想的束缚。他们的爱有时变成一种奇怪的偶像崇拜，一种奇异的与基督教相对的信仰。它是远古的维纳斯的回归，她并未死去，只是在维纳斯堡山洞里隐藏了一段时间，它是那些披着各式伪装仍旧在尘世间来回往复的古老异教诸神的回归。中世纪的这种元素很大程度上被那些认为中世纪主要是信仰时代的作家忽略。这种反叛性的反律法元素，对中世纪的这种认识，使得法国浪漫主义流派作家对中世纪的描述，例如维克多·雨果《巴黎圣母院》中的描述，极具启发意义并令人兴奋——在阿伯拉尔和汤豪泽的传奇中也能找到。渐渐地，当我们在通常被称作中世纪的、囊括一切的混乱中标记看法的改变和区别时，那种反叛、那种对心灵和思想自由的邪恶要求渐渐浮现出来。跟普罗旺斯诗歌的发展有着奇异联系的阿尔比教派运动就有着浓厚的这种色彩。与阿尔比教派稍有瓜葛，就有充分理由令方济会的秩序，连带它的诗歌、它的神秘主义、它的“启明”，遭到宗教当局充分的怀疑。它影响了那些含混的预言式作家，比如弗洛拉的乔基姆，在“自由精神”的第三种、也是最后一个部分的华丽辞藻世界里奇思异想着——在这种“自由精神”中法律已经死亡。《奥卡森与尼克莱特》中也许有对这种精神的最显著的表现：奥卡森受到威胁，如果让尼克莱特成为他的情人，他就将遭受地狱之苦时所作的回答。作为一个充满爱意和感知的生灵，奥卡森看到通往天堂的道路上只有几个身体虚弱、疲惫不堪的老牧师同行，他们“不论白天夜晚都站在教堂圣坛上”，光着脚或是穿着带补丁的便鞋。不管“他如此深爱的美丽情人”尼克莱特会不会与他同行，对他来说，他都已准备好与他口中的“伟大学者”、演员们、战死的骑兵、潮流者（贵族：用以表示那些对生命外在最为热爱的野心勃勃的青年，多见于古老的行吟诗人的世界中）和“每人都有三两个忠于主人的骑士陪伴左右，在音乐中欢心愉悦，穿戴金银还有“蓝银相间”的美丽皮毛的美丽高雅的女士”一起，踏上地狱之路。</td>
		<td class="en">One of the strongest characteristics of that outbreak of the reason and the imagination, of that assertion of the liberty of the heart, in the middle age, which I have termed a medieval Renaissance, was its antinomianism, its spirit of rebellion and revolt against the moral and religious ideas of the time. In their search after the pleasures of the senses and the imagination, in their care for beauty, in their worship of the body, people were impelled beyond the bounds of the Christian ideal; and their love became sometimes a strange idolatry, a strange rival religion. It was the return of that ancient Venus, not dead, but only hidden for a time in the caves of the Venusberg, of those old pagan gods still going to and fro on the earth, under all sorts of disguises. And this element in the middle age, for the most part ignored by those writers who have treated it pre-eminently as the “Age of Faith”—this rebellious and antinomian element, the recognition of which has made the delineation of the middle age by the writers of the Romantic school in France, by Victor Hugo for in stance in Notre-Dame de Paris so suggestive and ex citing—is found alike in the history of Abelard and the legend of Tannhäuser. More and more, as we come to mark changes and distinctions of temper in what is often in one all-embracing confusion called the middle age, that rebellion, that sinister claim for liberty of heart and thought, comes to the surface. The Albigensian movement, connected so strangely with the history of Provensal poetry, is deeply tinged with it. A touch of it makes the Franciscan6 order, with its poetry, its mysticism, its “illumination,” from the point of view of religious authority, justly suspect. It influences the thoughts of those obscure prophetical writers, like Joachim of Flora, strange dreamers in a world of flowery rhetoric of that third and final dispensation of a “spirit of freedom,” in which law shall have passed away. Of this spirit Aucassin and Nicolette contains perhaps the most famous expression: it is the answer Aucassin gives when he is threatened with the pains of hell, if he makes Nicolette his mistress. A creature wholly of affection and the senses, he sees on the way to paradise only a feeble and worn-out company of aged priests, “clinging day and night to the chapel altars,” barefoot or in patched sandals. With or even without Nicolette, “his sweet mistress whom he so much loves,” he, for his part, is ready to start on the way to hell, along with “the good scholars,” as he says, and the actors, and the fine horse men dead in battle, and the men of fashion (Parage, peerage:—which came to signify all that ambitious youth affected most on the outside of life, in that old world of the Troubadours, with whom this term is of frequent recurrence.), and “the fair courteous ladies who had two or three chevaliers apiece beside their own true lords,” all gay with music, in their gold, and silver, and beautiful furs—“the vair and the grey.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But in the House Beautiful the saints, too, have their place; and the student of the Renaissance has this advantage over the student of the emancipation of the human mind in the Reformation, or the French Revolution, that in tracing the footsteps of humanity to higher levels, he is not beset at every turn by the inflexibilities and antagonisms of some well-recognised controversy, with rigidly defined opposites, exhausting the intelligence and limiting one’s sympathies. The opposition of the professional defenders of a mere system to that more sincere and generous play of the forces of human mind and character, which I have noted as the secret of Abelard’s struggle, is, indeed, always powerful. But the incompatibility with one another of souls really “fair” is not essential; and within the enchanted region of the Renaissance one needs not be for ever on one’s guard. Here there are no fixed parties, no exclusions: all breathes of that unity of culture in which “whatsoever things are comely” are reconciled, for the elevation and adorning of our spirits. And just in proportion as those who took part in the Renaissance become centrally representative of it, just so much the more is this condition realised in them. The wicked popes, and the loveless tyrants, who from time to time became its patrons, or mere speculators in its fortunes, lend them selves easily to disputations, and, from this side or that, the spirit of controversy lays just hold upon them. But the painter of the Last Supper, with his kindred, lives in a land where controversy has no breathing-place. They refuse to be classified. In the story of Aucassin and Nicoltte, in the literature which it represents, the note of defiance, of the opposition of one system to an other, is sometimes harsh. Let me conclude then with a morsel from Amis and Amile, in which the harmony of human interests is still entire. For the story of the great traditional friendship, in which, as I said, the liberty of the heart makes itself felt, seems, as we have it, to have been written by a monk—La vie des saints martyrs Amis et Amile.

		<td class="en">In Leonardo’s treatise on painting only one contemporary is mentioned by name—Sandro Botticelli. This preëminence may be due to chance only, but to some will rather appear a result of deliberate judgment; for people have begun to find out the charm of Botticelli’s work, and his name, little known in the last century, is quietly becoming important. In the middle of the fifteenth century he had already anticipated much of that meditative subtlety, which is sometimes supposed peculiar to the great imaginative workmen of its close. Leaving the simple religion which had occupied the followers of Giotto1 for a century, and the simple naturalism which had grown out of it, a thing of birds and flowers only, he sought inspiration in what to him were works of the modern world, the writings of Dante and Boccaccio, and in new readings of his own of classical stories: or, if he painted religious incidents, painted them with an under current of original sentiment, which touches you as the real matter of the picture through the veil of its ostensible subject. What is the peculiar sensation, what is the peculiar quality of pleasure, which his work has the property of exciting in us, and which we cannot get elsewhere? For this, especially when he has to speak of a comparatively unknown artist, is always the chief question which a critic has to answer.</td></tr>

Criticism, indeed, has cleared away much of the gossip which Vasari2 accumulated, has touched the legend of Lippo and Lucrezia, and rehabilitated the character of Andrea del Castagno. But in Botticelli’s case there is no legend to dissipate. He did not even go by his true name: Sandro is a nick name, and his true name is Filipepi, Botticelli being only the name of the goldsmith who first taught him art. Only two things happened to him, two things which he shared with other artist:—he was invited to Rome to paint in the Sistine Chapel, and he fell in later life under the influence of Savonarola, passing apparently almost out of men’s sight in a sort of religious melancholy, which lasted till his death in 1515, according to the received date. Vasari says that he plunged into the study of Dante, and even wrote a comment on the Divine Comedy. But it seems strange that he should have lived on inactive so long; and one almost wishes that some document might come to light, which, fixing the date of his death earlier, might relieve one, in thinking of him, of his dejected old age.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He is before all things a poetical painter, blending the charm of story and sentiment, the medium of the art of poetry, with the charm of line and color, the medium of abstract painting. So he becomes the illustrator of Dante. In a few rare examples of the edition of 1481, the blank spaces, left at the beginning of every canto for the hand of the illuminator, have been filled, as far as the nineteenth canto of the Inferno, with impressions of engraved plates, seemingly by way of experiment, for in the copy in the Bodleian Library, one of the three impressions it contains has been printed upside flown, and much awry, in the midst of the luxurious printed page. Giotto, and the followers of Giotto, with their almost childish religious aim, had not learned to put that weight of meaning into outward things, light, color, everyday gesture, which the poetry of the Divine Comedy involves, and before the fifteenth century Dante could hardly have found an illustrator. Botticelli’s illustrations are crowded with incident, blending, with a naive carelessness of pictorial propriety, three phases of the same scene into one plate. The grotesques, so often a stumbling-block to painters, who forget that the words of a poet, which only feebly present an image to the mind, must be lowered in key when translated into visible form, make one regret that he has not rather chosen for illustration the more subdued imagery of the Purgatorio. Yet in the scene of those who “go down quick into hell,” there is an inventive force about the fire taking hold on the upturned soles of the feet, which proves that the design is no mere translation of Dante’s words, but a true painter’s vision; while the scene of the Centaurs wins one at once, for, forgetful of the actual circum stances of their appearance, Botticelli has gone off with delight on the thought of the Centaurs themselves, bright, small creatures of the woodland, with arch baby faces and mignon forms, drawing tiny bows.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Botticelli lived in a generation of naturalists, and he might have been a mere naturalist among them. There are traces enough in his work of that alert sense of out ward things, which, in the pictures of that period, fills the lawns with delicate living creatures, and the hillsides with pools of water, and the pools of water with flowering reeds. But this was not enough for him; he is a visionary painter, and in his visionariness he resembles Dante. Giotto, the tried companion of Dante, Masaccio, Ghirlandajo even, do but transcribe, with more or less refining, the outward image; they are dramatic, not visionary painters; they are almost impassive spectators of the action before them. But the genius of which Botticelli is the type usurps the data before it as the exponent of ideas, moods, visions of its own; in this interest it plays fast and loose with those data, rejecting some and isolating others, and always combining them anew. To him, as to Dante, the scene, the color, the out ward image or gesture, comes with all its incisive and importunate reality; but awakes in him, moreover, by some subtle law of his own structure, a mood which it awakes in no one else, of which it is the double or repetition, and which it clothes, that all may share it, with visible circumstance.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But he is far enough from accepting the conventional orthodoxy of Dante which, referring all human action to the simple formula of purgatory, heaven and hell, leaves an insoluble element of prose in the depths of Dante’s poetry. One picture of his, with the portrait of the donor, Matteo Palmieri, below, had the credit or discredit of attracting some shadow of ecclesiastical censure. This Matteo Palmieri (two dim figures move under that name in contemporary history) was the reputed author of a poem, still unedited, “La Città Divina,” which represented the human race as an incarnation of those angels who, in the revolt of Lucifer, were neither for Jehovah nor for His enemies, a fantasy of that earlier Alexandrian philosophy about which the Florentine intellect in that century was so curious. Botticelli’s picture may have been only one of those familiar compositions in which religious reverie has recorded its impressions of the various forms of beatified existence—Glorias, as they were called, like that in which Giotto painted the portrait of Dante; but somehow it was suspected of embodying in a picture the wayward dream of Palmieri, and the chapel where it hung was closed. Artists so entire as Botticelli are usually careless about philosophical theories, even when the philosopher is a Florentine of the fifteenth century, and his work a poem in terza rima. But Botticelli, who wrote a commentary on Dante, and became the disciple of Savonarola, may well have let such theories come and go across him. True or false, the story interprets much of the peculiar sentiment with which he infuses his profane and sacred persons, comely, and in a certain sense like angels, but with a sense of displacement or loss about them—the wistfulness of exiles, conscious of a passion and energy greater than any known issue of them explains, which runs through all his varied work with a sentiment of ineffable melancholy. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">So just what Dante scorns as unworthy alike of heaven and hell, Botticelli accepts, that middle world in which men take no side in great conflicts, and decide no great causes, and make great refusals. He thus sets for himself the limits within which art, undisturbed by any moral ambition, does its most sincere and surest work. His interest is neither in the untempered goodness of Arigelico’s saints, nor the untempered evil of Orcagna’s Inferno; but with men and women, in their mixed and uncertain condition, always attractive, clothed sometimes by passion with a character of loveliness and energy, but saddened perpetually by the shadow upon them of the great things from which they shrink.

		<td class="en">It is this which gives to his Madonnas their unique expression and charm. He has worked out in them a distinct and peculiar type, definite enough in his own mind, for he has painted it over and over again, some times one might think almost mechanically, as a pastime during that dark period when his thoughts were so heavy upon him. Hardly any collection of note is without one of these circular pictures, into which the attendant an gels depress their heads so naively. Perhaps you have sometimes wondered why those peevish-looking Ma donnas, conformed to no acknowledged or obvious type of beauty, attract you more and more, and often come back to you when the Sistine Madonna and the Virgins of Fra Angelico are forgotten. At first, contrasting them with those, you may have thought that there was some thing in them mean or abject even, for the abstract lines of the face have little nobleness, and the color is wan. For with Botticelli she too, though she holds in her hands the Desire of All Nations, is one of those who are neither for Jehovah nor for His enemies; and her choice is on her face. The white light on it is cast up hard and cheerless from below, as when snow lies upon the ground, and the children look up with surprise at the strange whiteness of the ceiling. Her trouble is in the very caress of the mysterious child, whose gaze is always far from her, and who has already that sweet look of devotion which men have never been able altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an object almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren. Once, indeed, he guides her hand to transcribe in a book the words of her exaltation, the Ave, and the Magnificat, and the Gaude Maria, and the young angels, glad to rouse her for a moment from her dejection, are eager to hold the inkhorn and to support the book. But the pen almost drops from her hand, and the high cold words have no meaning for her, and her true children are those others, among whom, in her rude home, the intolerable honor came to her, with that look of wistful inquiry on their irregular faces which you see in startled animals—gipsy children, such as those who, in Apennine villages, still hold out their long, brown arms to beg of you, but on Sundays become enfants du chceur, with their thick black hair nicely combed, and fair white linen on their sunburnt throats.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">What is strangest is that he carries this sentiment into classical subjects, its most complete expression being a picture in the uffizii, of Venus rising from the sea, in which the grotesque emblems of the middle age, and a landscape full of its peculiar feeling, and even its strange draperies, powdered all over in the Gothic manner with a quaint conceit of daisies, frame a figure that reminds you of the faultless nude studies of Ingres. At first, perhaps, you are attracted only by a quaintness of de sign, which seems to recall all at once whatever you have read of Florence in the fifteenth century; afterwards you may think that this quaintness must be incongruous with the subject, and that the color is cadaverous or at least cold. And yet, the more you come to understand what imaginative coloring really is, that all color is no mere delightful quality of natural things, but a spirit upon them by which they become expressive to the spirit, the better you will like this peculiar quality of color; and you will find that quaint design of Botticelli’s a more direct inlet into the Greek temper than the works of the Greeks themselves even of the finest period. Of the Greeks as they really were, of their difference from ourselves, of the aspects of their outward life, we know far more than Botticelli, or his most learned contemporaries; but for us long familiarity has taken off the edge of the lesson, and we are hardly conscious of what we owe to the Hellenic spirit. But in pictures like this of Botticelli’s you have a record of the first impression made by it on minds turned back towards it, in almost painful aspiration, from a world in which it had been ignored so long; and in the passion, the energy, the industry of realisation, with which Botticelli carries out his intention, is the exact measure of the legitimate influence over the human mind of the imaginative system of which this is perhaps the central myth. The light is indeed cold— mere sunless dawn; but a later painter would have cloyed you with sunshine; and you can see the better for that quietness in the morning air each long promontory, as it slopes down to the water’s edge. Men go forth to their labors until the evening; but she is awake before them, and you might think that the sorrow in her face was at the thought of the whole long day of love yet to come. An emblematical figure of the wind blows hard across the grey water, moving forward the dainty -lipped shell on which she sails, the sea “showing his teeth,” as it moves, in thin lines of foam, and sucking in, one by one, the falling roses, each severe in outline, plucked off short at the stalk, but embrowned a little, as Botticelli’s flowers always are. Botticelli meant all this imagery to be altogether pleasurable; and it was partly an incompleteness of resources, inseparable from the art of that time, that subdued and chilled it. But this predilection for minor tones counts also; and what is un mistakable is the sadness with which he has conceived the goddess of pleasure, as the depositary of a great power over the lives of men.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I have said that the peculiar character of Botticelli is the result of a blending in him of a sympathy for humanity in its uncertain condition, its attractiveness, its investiture at rarer moments in a character of loveliness and energy, with his consciousness of the shadow upon it of the great things from which it shrinks, and that this conveys into his work somewhat more than painting usually attains of the true complexion of humanity. He paints the story of the goddess of pleasure in other episodes besides that of her birth from the sea, but never without some shadow of death in the grey flesh and wan flowers. He paints Madonnas, but they shrink from the pressure of the divine child, and plead in un mistakable undertones for a warmer, lower humanity. The same figure—tradition connects it with Simonetta, the Mistress of Giuliano de’ Medici—appears again as Judith, returning home across the hill country, when the great deed is over, and the moment of revulsion come, when the olive branch in her hand is becoming a burthen; as Justice, sitting on a throne, but with a fixed look of self-hatred which makes the sword in her hand seem that of a suicide; and again as Veritas, in the allegorical picture of Calumnia, where one may note in passing the suggestiveness of an accident which identifies the image of Truth with the person of Venus. We might trace the same sentiment through his engravings; but his share in them is doubtful, and the object of this brief study has been attained, if I have defined aright the temper in which he worked.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But, after all, it may be asked, is a painter like Botticelli—a secondary painter, a proper subject for general criticism? There are a few great painters, like Michelangelo or Leonardo, whose work has become a force in general culture, partly for this very reason that they have absorbed into themselves all such workmen as Sandro Botticelli; and, over and above mere technical or antiquarian criticism, general criticism may be very well employed in that sort of interpretation which adjusts the position of these men to general culture, whereas smaller men can be the proper subjects only of technical or antiquarian treatment. But, besides those great men, there is a certain number of artists who have a distinct faculty of their own by which they convey to us a peculiar quality of pleasure which we cannot get elsewhere; and these, too, have their place in general culture, and must be interpreted to it by those who have felt their charm strongly, and are often the object of a special diligence and a consideration wholly affectionate, just because there is not about them the stress of a great name and authority. Of this select number Botticelli is one. He has the freshness, the uncertain and diffident promise, which belong to the earlier Renaissance itself, and make it perhaps the most interesting period in the history of the mind. In studying his work one begins to understand to how great a place in human culture the art of Italy had been called. </td></tr>

Their sculpture shares with the paintings of Botticelli and the churches of Brunelleschi that profound expressiveness, that intimate impress of an in dwelling soul, which is the peculiar fascination of the art of Italy in that century. Their works have been much neglected, and often almost hidden away amid the frippery of modern decoration, and we come with some surprise on the places where their fire still smolders. One longs to penetrate into the lives of the men who have given expression to so much power and sweetness. But it is part of the reserve, the austere dignity and simplicity of their existence, that their histories are for the most part lost, or told but briefly. From their lives, as from their work, all tumult of sound and color has passed away.

And no work is less imitable: like Tuscan wine, it loses its savor when moved from its birthplace, from the crumbling walls where it was first placed.

Against this tendency to the hard presentment of mere form trying vainly to compete with the reality of nature itself, all noble sculpture constantly struggles; each great system of sculpture resisting it in its own way, etherealising, spiritualising, relieving its stiffness, its heaviness, and death. The use of color in sculpture is but an unskillful contrivance to effect, by borrowing from another art, what the nobler sculpture effects by strictly appropriate means.

When Michelangelo came, therefore, with a genius spiritualised by the reverie of the middle age, penetrated by its spirit of inwardness and introspection, living not a mere outward life like the Greek, but a life full of intimate experiences, sorrows, consolations, a system which sacrificed so much of what was inward and unseen could not satisfy him.

		<td class="en">And so, in a way quite personal and peculiar to him self, which often is, and always seems, the effect of accident, he secured for his work individuality and intensity of expression, while he avoided a too heavy realism, that tendency to harden into caricature which the representation of feeling in sculpture is apt to display. What time and accident, its centuries of darkness under the furrows of the “little Melian farm,” have done with singular felicity of touch for the Venus of Melos, fraying its surface and softening its lines, so that some spirit in the thing seems always on the point of breaking out, as though in it classical sculpture had advanced already one step into the mystical Christian age, its expression being in the whole range of ancient work most like that of Michelangelo’s own:—this effect Michelangelo gains by leaving nearly all his sculpture in a puzzling sort of incompleteness, which suggests rather than realises actual form. Something of the wasting of that snow- image which he molded at the command of Piero de’ Medici, when the snow lay one night in the court of the Pitti palace, almost always lurks about it, as if he had determined to make the quality of a task, exacted from him half in derision, the pride of all his work. Many have wondered at that incompleteness, suspecting, however, that Michelangelo himself loved and was loath to change it, and feeling at the same time that they, too, would lose something if the half-realised form ever quite emerged from the stone, so rough-hewn here, so delicately finished there; and they have wished to fathom the charm of this incompleteness. Well! that incompleteness is Michelangelo’s equivalent for color in sculpture; it is his way of etherealizing pure form, of relieving its stiff realism, and communicating to it breath, pulsation, the effect of life. It was a characteristic, too, which fell in with his peculiar temper and mode of living, his disappointments and hesitations. And it was in reality perfect finish. In this way he combines the utmost amount of passion and intensity with the sense of a yielding and flexible life: he gets not vitality merely, but a wonderful force of expression.</td></tr>

Like Michelangelo, these sculptors fill their works with intense and individualised expression. Their noblest works are the careful sepulchral portraits of particular persons—the monument of Conte Ugo in the Badía of Florence, of the youthful Medea Colleoni, with the wonderful, long throat, in the chapel on the cool north side of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Bergamo—monuments such as abound in the churches of Rome, inexhaustible in suggestions of repose, of a subdued Sabbatic joy, a kind of sacred grace and refinement.

		<td class="en">The life of Luca, a life of labor and frugality, with no adventure and no excitement except what belongs to the trial of new artistic processes, the struggle with new artistic difficulties, the solution of purely artistic problems, fills the first seventy years of the fifteenth century. After producing many works in marble for the Duomo and the Campanile of Florence, which place him among the foremost masters of the sculpture of his age, he became desirous to realise the spirit and manner of that sculpture, in a humbler material, to unite its science, its exquisite and expressive system of low relief, to the homely art of pottery, to introduce those high qualities into common things, to adorn and cultivate daily household life. In this he is profoundly characteristic of the Florence of that century, of that in it which lay below its superficial vanity and caprice, a certain old-world modesty and seriousness and simplicity. People had not yet begun to think that what was good art for churches was not so good, or less fitted, for their own houses. Luca’s new work was in plain white earthenware at first, a mere rough imitation of the costly, laboriously wrought marble, finished in a few hours. But on this humble path he found his way to a fresh success, to another artistic grace. The fame of the oriental pottery, with its strange, bright colors—colors of art, colors not to be attained in the natural stone—mingled with the tradition of the old Roman pottery of the neighborhood. The little red, coral-like jars of Arezzo, dug up in that district from time to time, are much prized. These colors haunted Luca’s fancy. “He still continued seeking some thing more,” his biographer says of him; “and instead of making his figures of baked earth simply white, he added the further invention of giving them color, to the astonishment and delight of all who beheld them”— Cosa singolare, e multo utile per la state!—a curious thing, and very useful for summer- time, full of coolness and repose for hand and eye. Luca loved the forms of various fruits, and wrought them into all sorts of marvelous frames and garlands, giving them their natural colors, only subdued a little, a little paler than nature.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I said that the art of Luca della Robbia possessed in an unusual measure that special characteristic which be longs to all the workmen of his school, a characteristic which, even in the absence of much positive information about their actual history, seems to bring those workmen themselves very near to us. They bear the impress of a personal quality, a profound expressiveness, what the French call intimité, by which is meant some subtler sense of originality—the seal on a man’s work of what is most inward and peculiar in his moods, and manner of apprehension: it is what we call expression, carried to its highest intensity of degree. That characteristic is rare in poetry, rarer still in art, rarest of all in the abstract art of sculpture; yet essentially, perhaps, it is the quality which alone makes work in the imaginative order really worth having at all. It is because the works of the artists of the fifteenth century possess this quality in an unmistakable way that one is anxious to know all that can be known about them and explain to one’s self the secret of their charm.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >米开朗琪罗的批评家有时会认为，他天赋的唯一特色似乎是一种伟大力量，它和在想象性的事物中的伟大力量一样，接近异常性或奇异性的边缘。这种奇异性，如同芦荟开花一般的奇异性，的确是所有真正艺术品的一个元素：它注定能使我们兴奋，让我们惊讶，但也注定给我们带来愉悦或者让我们感受到其魅力所在。这种奇异性也是醇美的—一种可爱的奇异。对米开朗琪罗真正的仰慕者来说，这才是真正的米开朗琪罗风格：醇美有力、愉悦中伴随着惊喜、概念的能量好像随时都会突破美好形式的所有制约，一点点重新获得通常只在最简单的自然物里——从有力的醇美里——才找得到的可爱和美好。</td>
		<td class="en">Critics of Michelangelo have sometimes spoken as if the only characteristic of his genius were a wonderful strength, verging, as in the things of the imagination great strength always does, on what is singular or strange. A certain strangeness, something of the blossoming of the aloe, is indeed an element in all true works of art: that they shall excite or surprise us is indispensable. But that they shall give pleasure and exert a charm over us is indispensable, too; and this strangeness must be sweet also—a lovely strangeness. And to the true admirers of Michelangelo this is the true type of the Michelangelesque—sweetness and strength, pleasure with surprise, an energy of conception which seems at every moment about to break through all the conditions of comely form, recovering, touch by touch, a loveliness found usually only in the simplest natural things—ex forti dulcedo.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他以这种方式为他的仰慕者们总结出了中世纪艺术本身的整体特色：这一时期的艺术和古典艺术最大的不同在于它包含的剧烈能量，这种能量在粗陋的手法中只会变得畸形和可怕，在最高雅的作品里也只是让人感到一种受压抑的离奇或怪异。不过在米开朗琪罗作品中感受到高雅舒适的人，可能最初在被问到这些特质到底存在于何处时也会感到茫然。对于具有创造性气质的人，比如维克多·雨果，正如米开朗琪罗一样，人们大部分是被这种能量吸引或者对它产生抗拒，但很少有人理解它的美妙芳醇。这些人有时削弱了纯道德伟大性或宗教伟大性的概念，但自己却缺乏美学的魅力，通过细腻的偶然事件或点缀，比如《悲惨世界》里飞落在血迹斑斑的路障上的蝴蝶，或是《海上劳工》中的那些海鸟，残暴的吉列特变成了让他们不再害怕的野生动物。但是米开朗琪罗一丝不苟的天赋不会依靠任何这样的附加品来体现它的醇美。自然界对他来说几乎不存在。“人们说起他时，”格里姆说，“森林、云朵、海洋和高山都消失了，只存在着人类思想形成的一切。”他还引用了米开朗琪罗写给瓦萨里的信中一些轻描淡写的词语来作为他对自然所存留的感情的唯一表达。他没有描绘过花朵，不像达·芬奇那样用花朵来点缀最阴暗的石头；也不像布莱克那样用浮雕的翅膀和火焰架构自己最惊人的概念；他也从来不用提香那种森林景色填充自己的背景，只会用一排排单调的石头，还有一样暗淡单调的植物，就像创世前五天之前的世界。</td>
		<td class="en">In this way he sums up for them the whole character of medieval art itself in that which distinguishes it most clearly from classical work, the presence of a convulsive energy in it, becoming in lower hands merely monstrous or forbidding, and felt, even in its most graceful products, as a subdued quaintness or grotesque. Yet those who feel this grace or sweetness in Michelangelo might at the first moment be puzzled if they were asked wherein precisely such quality resided. Men of inventive temperament—Victor Hugo, for instance, in whom, as in Michelangelo, people have for the most part been attracted or repelled by the strength, while few have under stood his sweetness—have sometimes relieved conceptions of merely moral or spiritual greatness, but with little aesthetic charm of their own, by lovely accidents or accessories, like the butterfly which alights on the blood-stained barricade in Les Misérables or those seabirds for whom the monstrous Gilliatt comes to be as some wild natural thing, so that they are no longer afraid of him, in Les Travailleurs de la Mer. But the austere genius of Michelangelo will not depend for its sweetness on any mere accessories like these. The world of natural things has almost no existence for him; “When one speaks of him,” says Grimm, “woods, clouds, seas, and mountains disappear, and only what is formed by the spirit of man remains behind”; and he quotes a few slight words from a letter of his to Vasari as the single expression in all he has left of a feeling for nature. He has traced no flowers, like those with which Leonardo stars over his gloomiest rocks; nothing like the fret work of wings and flames in which Blake frames his most startling conceptions. No forest-scenery like Titian’s fills his backgrounds, but only blank ranges of rock, and dim vegetable forms as blank as they, as in a world before the creation of the first five days.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >关于整个创世故事，他只画下了第一个男人和第一个女人，以及至少对他而言，含糊的，光的创造。因此他天赋的特质就是专注于人的创造。对他来说，人的创造不是像创世故事中那种一系列阶段的最终的、画龙点睛的部分，而是首先的、独特的动作，是在冰冷无生命的石头上即兴创造的生命的最高形式。在他那里，生命的初始有着复苏的全部特点，如同处在恢复过程中的健康或活力带着感激、带着喷薄的感情和滔滔的雄辩。西斯廷教堂里的亚当尽管俊美如埃尔金大理石雕像中的青年男子，但却与他们并不相像，缺乏了那些雕像中充分表达生活的独立自足的平衡与完满。那个慵懒的形象里有着粗野的、萨梯似的气质，类似于他所躺的崎岖山坡。他的整体形象表达出来的是一种期待和接受，他几乎没有力气抬起手指去触碰创造者的手指；不过指尖相触便已足够了。</td>
		<td class="en">Of the whole story of the creation he has painted only the creation of the first man and woman, and, for him at least, feebly, the creation of light. It belongs to the quality of his genius thus to concern itself almost exclusively with the making of man. For him it is not, as in the story itself, the last and crowning act of a series of developments, but the first and unique act, the creation of life itself in its supreme form, offhand and immediately, in the cold and lifeless stone. With him the beginning of life has all the characteristics of resurrection; it is like the recovery of suspended health or animation, with its gratitude, its effusion, and eloquence. Fair as the young men of the Elgin marbles, the Adam of the Sistine Chapel is unlike them in a total absence of that balance and completeness which express so well the sentiment of a self-contained, independent life. In that languid figure there is something rude and satyr-like, some thing akin to the rugged hillside on which it lies. His whole form is gathered into an expression of mere expectancy and reception; he has hardly strength enough to lift his finger to touch the finger of the creator; yet a touch of the finger-tips will suffice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >生命的创造——生命总是作为解脱或复苏出现，总是与生命之火点燃之时所处之地周遭的粗糙形成强烈对比——以各种方式成为他所有创作的动机，不管作品的直接主题是异教还是基督教，传奇抑或寓言；虽然，他至少一半作品是为装饰墓地而创作的，比如尤里乌斯和美第奇家族的墓地。他在西斯廷教堂的最后一件作品，主题不是审判而是复活。他最喜欢的异教主题是勒达传奇这种世界从鸟蛋中破壳而出的喜悦。我已经指出，他通过某种不完整来确保表现力的理想状态，这种理想状态的希腊雕塑有赖于精巧的抽象体系来达到，而早期意大利雕像依靠浮雕的低浅来完成。这种不完整当然不总是无意的，而且我认为，没人会感到遗憾，也相信观众会复原未完全浮现的形式。因为他的人物里还有一些未完工的石料，这仿佛是用来实践古佛罗伦萨人记载的对雕塑家的描述：赋予石头生命的大师，在他面前，石头似乎也有了生命。他们只要把尘土和碎屑抖掉就能起身站立起来。他喜爱卡拉拉的采石场，那些怪异的灰色山峰即便在中午也显现出某种夜晚才有的严肃和静谧。他有时在山上徘徊数月，直到那些暗淡、苍白的颜色好像最终走入他的作品；《大卫》头上的王冠还有一处没有雕完的石头，就像是保持它和取材地的关联的一笔。</td>
		<td class="en">This creation of life—life coming always as relief or recovery, and always in strong contrast with the rough hewn mass in which it is kindled—is in various ways the motive of all his work, whether its immediate subject be Pagan or Christian, legend or allegory; and this, although at least one- half of his work was designed for the adornment of tombs—the tomb of Julius, the tombs of the Medici. Not the Judgment but the Resurrection is the real subject of his last work in the Sistine Chapel; and his favorite Pagan subject is the legend of Leda, the delight of the world breaking from the egg of a bird. As I have already pointed out, he secures that ideality of expression which in Greek sculpture depends on a delicate system of abstraction, and in early Italian sculpture on lowness of relief, by an incompleteness, which is surely not always undesigned, and which, as I think, no one regrets, and trusts to the spectator to complete the half-emergent form. And as his persons have some thing of the unwrought stone about them, so, as if to realise the expression by which the old Florentine records describe a sculptor—master of live stone—with him the very rocks seem to have life. They have but to cast away the dust and scurf that they may rise and stand on their feet. He loved the very quarries of Carrara, those strange grey peaks which even at midday convey into any scene from which they are visible some thing of the solemnity and stillness of evening, some times wandering among them month after month, till at last their pale ashen colors seem to have passed into his painting; and on the crown of the head of the David there still remains a morsel of uncut stone, as if by one touch to maintain its connection with the place from which it was hewn.</td></tr>

He gives us indeed no lovely natural objects like Leonardo or Titian, but only the coldest, most elementary shadowing of rock or tree; no lovely draperies and comely gestures of life, but only the austere truths of human nature; “simple persons”—as he replied in his rough way to the querulous criticism of Julius the Second, that there was no gold on the figures of the Sistine Chapel—“simple persons, who wore no gold on their garments”; but he penetrates us with a feeling of that power which we associate with all the warmth and fullness of the world, the sense of which brings into one’s thoughts a swarm of birds and flowers and insects.

He came of a race of grave and dignified men, who, claiming kin ship with the family of Canossa, and some color of imperial blood in their veins, had, generation after generation, received honorable employment under the government of Florence. His mother, a girl of nineteen years, put him out to nurse at a country house among the hills of Settignano, where every other inhabitant is a worker in the marble quarries, and the child early became familiar with that strange first stage in the sculptor’s art. To this succeeded the influence of the sweetest and most placid master Florence had yet seen, Domenico Ghirlandajo. At fifteen he was at work among the curiosities of the garden of the Medici, copying and restoring antiques, winning the condescending notice of the great Lorenzo.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为偶然的机会他研究了早期意大利雕塑家的作品，这些作品影响了他最伟大的作品，在作品里印下了很深的美妙芳醇的印迹。他相信梦境和征兆，他的一个朋友曾两次梦到去世不久的洛伦佐穿着肮脏的灰色衣服出现在他面前。米开朗琪罗认为这个梦预示了麻烦。后来梦境变成了现实，于是就像他一贯的作风一样，米开朗琪罗突然离开了佛罗伦萨。有一次路过博洛尼亚，他忘了盖上路过博洛尼亚的外乡人都要印在右手拇指上的红色蜡章。他也没有钱付罚金，多亏一位地方行政官提供了帮助才免受牢狱之灾。米开朗琪罗在他家里呆了一年，并通过朗读自己喜欢的意大利诗人的作品来报答他的热情款待。博洛尼亚有无数的柱廊和美轮美奂的斜塔，虽然它算不上是意大利最美丽的城市，但是，在宏大而半完成的教堂门廊里，在黑暗的神祠里，被还愿的花朵和蜡烛半遮住的是很多早期托斯卡纳雕塑家，如乔万尼·达比萨和雅各布·德拉奎尔恰最为精妙的作品，这些作品如花朵一般迷人。米开朗琪罗临摹这些作品的一年没有浪费。他返回佛罗伦萨后，创作出了独一无二的酒神巴克斯像：不是展现酒神的欢乐，而是他的倦怠和严肃，他的活力和他深沉的梦态。没人能像米开朗琪罗那样真实地表现获得了灵感的睡梦，或展现梦境中的脸庞这些概念。在奥尔卡尼亚的凉廊下有块巨大的大理石放了很久，很多雕塑家都想过要把这块著名的大理石完整雕刻出来，像切割钻石那样没一点损失。这块巨石在米开朗琪罗手下变成了《大卫》，一直立在韦基奥宫的台阶上，最近才被放回凉廊。此时米开朗琪罗30岁，他的名望已经树立起来。他的余生创作了3件伟大的作品——这3件作品在创作中常常中断，在经历重重犹豫、百般失望、与资助人争吵、与家人争吵和可能更多地与自己争吵之后才最终得以完成。这3件作品就是西斯廷教堂壁画、尤利乌斯二世陵墓和圣洛伦佐圣器所。</td>
		<td class="en">It was through an accident that he came to study those works of the early Italian sculptors which suggested much of his own grandest work, and impressed it with so deep a sweetness. He believed in dreams and omens. One of his friends dreamed twice that Lorenzo, then lately dead, appeared to him in grey and dusty apparel. To Michelangelo this dream seemed to portend the troubles which afterwards really came, and with the suddenness which was characteristic of all his movements, he left Florence. Having occasion to pass through Bologna, he neglected to procure the little seal of red wax which the stranger entering Bologna must carry on the thumb of his right hand. He had no money to pay the fine, and would have been thrown into prison had not one of the magistrates interposed. He remained in this man’s house a whole year, rewarding his hospitality by readings from the Italian poets whom he loved. Bologna, with its endless colonnades and fantastic leaning towers, can never have been one of the lovelier cities of Italy. But about the portals of its vast unfinished churches and its dark shrines, half hidden by votive f lowers and candles, lie some of the sweetest works of the early Tuscan sculptors, Giovanni da Pisa and Jacopo della Quercia, things as winsome as f lowers; and the year which Michelangelo spent in copying these works was not a lost year. It was now, on returning to Florence, that he put forth that unique presentment of Bacchus, which expresses, not the mirthfulness of the god of wine, but his sleepy seriousness, his enthusiasm, his capacity for profound dreaming. No one ever expressed more truly than Michelangelo the notion of inspired sleep, of faces charged with dreams. A vast fragment of marble had long lain below the Loggia of Orcagna, and many a sculptor had had his thoughts of a design which should just f ill this famous block of stone, cutting the diamond, as it were, without loss. Under Michel angelo’s hand it became the David which stood till lately on the steps of the Palazzo Vecchio, when it was replaced below the Loggia. Michelangelo was now thirty years old, and his reputation was established. Three great works f ill the remainder of his life—three works often interrupted, carried on through a thousand hesitations, a thousand disappointments, quarrels with his patrons, quarrels with his family, quarrels perhaps most of all with himself—the Sistine Chapel, the Mausoleum of Julius the Second, and the Sacristy of San Lorenzo.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在米开朗琪罗的人生故事中力量常常演化成痛苦，这种情况很容易发现。一个几乎毁了整首音乐的不和谐乐符贯穿其中。他“对待教皇”的方式几乎连法兰西国王自己也不敢这样。拉斐尔说他“像行刑人一样”走在罗马的大街上。有一回他似乎把自己封闭了起来，准备绝食而死。我们读到他人生中那些苛刻的不加节制的事情时总是一次次产生这样的想法：他就是被但丁评价为“决意生活在悲伤中”的人之一。即使他的温柔和怜悯，也因它们的力量变得苦涩。在《创造亚当》中，上帝把即将成形的女人和她的后代藏在衣褶里面，而在他肖像下面蜷缩着的神秘人物哭得是多么动情！两个被俘的少年感到锁链像滚烫的开水灼烧着他们骄傲柔弱的肉体，这是多么错误的感觉！这个理想主义者成为了和萨伏那洛拉并肩战斗的改革家，同时也是监督佛罗伦萨军事要塞工程的共和主义者。佛罗伦萨是他的出生地，“他出生的巢”，他某次突然表达爱意时的用词。虽然他一直认为自己流淌着皇室的血液，和伟大的玛蒂尔达同族，但在他内心深处有某种愤慨和悲伤在秘密地涌动。对他的青少年时代我们知之甚少，但所知的一切都使人们相信那段时光的激情澎湃。在十四行诗中，柏拉图式的平静下潜藏着对肉欲的形式和色彩的巨大喜悦。在这里，更多的是在短诗中，他常常陷进不那么宁静的爱情的语言中；并且其中有一些具有忏悔的色彩，像是归家浪子的诉说。他坚定地宣称在想象世界里裸露的人类形体具有至高无上的地位。我们认为他不总是纯粹的柏拉图式的情人。他的爱情可能是模糊和任性的，但却带有几分他天性的力量。有时候，它绝不可能变成音乐，这样他生活的良好秩序就被打乱了：这样我感到的美好都成了每天的痛苦。</td>
		<td class="en">In the story of Michelangelo’s life the strength, often turning to bitterness, is not far to seek. A discordant note sounds throughout it which almost spoils the music. He “treats the Pope as the King of France himself would not dare to treat him”: he goes along the streets of Rome “like an executioner,” Raphael says of him. Once he seems to have shut himself up with the intention of starving himself to death. As we come, in reading his life, on its harsh, untempered incidents, the thought again and again arises that he is one of those who incur the judgment of Dante, as having “wilfully lived in sadness.” Even his tenderness and pity are embittered by their strength. What passionate weeping in that mysterious figure which, in the Creation of Adam, crouches below the image of the Almighty, as he comes with the forms of things to be, woman and her progeny, in the fold of his garment! What a sense of wrong in those two captive youths, who feel the chains like scalding water on their proud and delicate flesh! The idealist who became a reformer with Savonarola, and a republican superintending the fortification of Florence—the nest where he was born, il nido ove naqqu’io, as he calls it once, in a sudden throb of affection—in its last struggle for liberty, yet believed always that he had imperial blood in his veins and was of the kindred of the great Matilda, had within the depths of his nature some secret spring of indignation or sorrow. We know little of his youth, but all tends to make one believe in the vehemence of its passions. Beneath the Platonic calm of the sonnets there is latent a deep delight in carnal form and color. There, and still more in the madrigals, he often falls into the language of less tranquil affections; while some of them have the color of penitence, as from a wanderer returning home. He who spoke so decisively of the supremacy in the imaginative world of the unveiled human form had not been always, we may think, a mere Platonic lover. Vague and wayward his loves may have been; but they partook of the strength of his nature, and sometimes, it may be, would by no means become music, so that the comely order of his days was quite put out: par che amaro ogni mio dolce io senta. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">But his genius is in harmony with itself; and just as in the products of his art we find resources of sweetness within their exceeding strength, so in his own story also, bitter as the ordinary sense of it may be, there are select pages shut in among the rest—pages one might easily turn over too lightly, but which yet sweeten the whole volume. The interest of Michelangelo’s poems is that they make us spectators of this struggle; the struggle of a strong nature to adorn and attune itself; the struggle of a desolating passion, which yearns to be resigned and sweet and pensive, as Dante’s was. It is a consequence of the occasional and informal character of his poetry, that it brings us nearer to himself, his own mind and temper, than any work done only to support a literary reputation could possibly do. His letters tell us little that is worth knowing about him—a few poor quarrels about money and commissions. But it is quite other wise with these songs and sonnets, written down at odd moments, sometimes on the margins of his sketches, themselves often unfinished sketches, arresting some salient feeling or unpremeditated idea as it passed. And it happens that a true study of these has become within the last few years for the first time possible. A few of the sonnets circulated widely in manuscript, and became almost within Michelangelo’s own lifetime a subject of academical discourses. But they were first collected in a volume in 1623 by the great-nephew of Michelangelo, Michelangelo Buonarroti the younger. He omitted much, re-wrote the sonnets in part, and sometimes com pressed two or more compositions into one, always losing something of the force and incisiveness of the original. So the book remained, neglected even by Italians themselves in the last century, through the influence of that French taste which despised all composition of the kind, as it despised and neglected Dante. “His reputation will ever be on the increase, because he is so little read,” says Voltaire of Dante.—But in 1858 the last of the Buonarroti bequeathed to the municipality of Florence the curiosities of his family. Among them was a precious volume containing the autograph of the sonnets. A learned Italian, Signor Cesare Guasti, under took to collate this autograph with other manuscripts at the Vatican and elsewhere, and in 1863 published a true version of Michelangelo’s poems, with dissertations and a paraphrase. (The sonnets have been translated into English, with much skill and poetic taste, by Mr. J. A. Symonds.) </td></tr>

		<td class="en">People have often spoken of these poems as if they were a mere cry of distress, a lover’s complaint over the obduracy of Vittoria Colonna. But those who speak thus forget that though it is quite possible that Michel-angelo had seen Vittoria, that somewhat shadowy figure, as early as 1537, yet their closer intimacy did not begin till about the year 1542, when Michelangelo was nearly seventy years old. Vittoria herself, an ardent neo-catholic, vowed to perpetual widowhood since the news had reached her, seventeen years before, that her husband, the youthful and princely Marquess of Pescara, lay dead of the wounds he had received in the battle of Pavia, was then no longer an object of great passion. In a dialogue written by the painter, Francesco d’Ollanda, we catch a glimpse of them together in an empty church at Rome, one Sunday afternoon, discussing, indeed, the characteristics of various schools of art, but still more the writings of Saint Paul, already following the ways and tasting the sunless pleasures of weary people, whose care for external things is slackening. In a letter still extant he regrets that when he visited her after death he had kissed her hands only. He made, or set to work to make, a crucifix for her use, and two drawings, perhaps in preparation for it, are now in Oxford. From allusions in the sonnets, we may divine that when they first approached each other he had debated much with himself whether this last passion would be the most unsoftening, the most desolating of all—un dolce amaro, un si e no mi muovi. Is it carnal affection, or, del suo prestino stato (of Plato’s ante-natal state) it raggio ardente? The older, conventional criticism, dealing with the text of 1623, had lightly assumed that all, or nearly all, the sonnets were actually addressed to Vittoria herself; but Signor Guasti finds only four, or at most five, which can be so attributed on genuine authority. Still, there are reasons which make him assign the majority of them to the period between 1542 and 1547, and we may regard the volume as a record of this resting-plate in Michel angelo’s story. We know how Goethe escaped from the stress of sentiments too strong for him by making a book about them; and for Michelangelo, to write down his passionate thoughts at all, to express them in a sonnet, was already in some measure to command, and have his way with them —</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >通过使强烈的感情理想化，以使生命获得安宁芳醇的努力一般有两种类型的伟大传统，16世纪的意大利人可能会遵循任意一种。但丁就是这样，他的短小诗集《新生》早就成为了一种想象爱情的范式。这种范式被后来的彼特拉克保留了一些。而且因为马尔西利奥·菲奇诺把柏拉图的作品翻译成拉丁文出版，柏拉图在意大利已不仅只是一个名字，这里也就有了柏拉图主义的传统。但丁信仰肉体复活，所以对他来说，即使在天堂里贝雅特丽齐也没有失去一丝血色，甚至衣服的褶皱也保留着；柏拉图式的梦想是灵魂经历生命的种种形式，还带着急切的热情要逃离全部身体形式的负担。对所有的艺术或诗歌效果来说，这两种传统是截然相反的原则。此时不是但丁传统，而是柏拉图传统塑造了米开朗琪罗的诗歌。在很多方面，米开朗琪罗对维多利亚·科洛纳的爱和但丁对贝雅特丽齐的爱都是截然不同的。但丁的爱发生在少年时代：贝雅特丽齐是个小孩，有着孩子的惆怅的、模糊不清的想法，个性还没有受到外部世界的影响，几乎还没有表达力。而另一方面，维多利亚却是一个已经有些许疲倦、上了点年纪、有着庄重理性品质的女人。但丁的故事是形象的，里面嵌入了一些有趣的故事。而在米开朗琪罗的诗歌里几乎只有霜和火的形象：铁匠打铁的火苗，一两次凤凰涅涅槃之火，冰在火里融化，火从岩石中喷薄而出又把岩石毁掉。除了有一个不明确的隐喻，提到一次旅程，几乎不再有任何事件。但是米开朗琪罗有很多聪明、睿智并且精准的技巧，正是这些技巧使他在少年时代就曾从农牧神头像的下颚一锤敲掉一颗牙齿，而让它有了成年的表情。在但丁看来，中世纪亲切虔诚的唯物主义使所有用手或眼呈现出来的东西神圣起来。而米开朗琪罗则总是努力追求超越外在美；领会那种不可见之美；超越普遍的形式—那种美的抽象形式是柏拉图派学者思考的对象。这给他一种迁移不定的印象，一种无家可归、怨天尤人的灵魂的印象。这灵魂从虚弱屈从的肉体中就可以洞察出来。他把一见钟情解释成前世的存在—我在前世的爱你之地。</td>
		<td class="en">In this effort to tranquillise and sweeten life by idealising its vehement sentiments, there were two great traditional types, either of which an Italian of the sixteenth century might have followed. There was Dante, whose little book of the Vita Nuova had early become a pattern of imaginative love, maintained somewhat feebly by the later followers of Petrarch; and, since Plato had become something more than a name in Italy by the publication of the Latin translation of his works by Marsilio Ficino, there was the Platonic tradition also. Dante’s belief in the resurrection of the body through which, even in heaven, Beatrice loses for him no tinge of flesh-color, or fold of raiment even; and the Platonic dream of the passage of the soul through one form of life after another, with its passionate haste to escape from the burden of bodily form altogether; are, for all effects of art or poetry, principles diametrically opposite. Now it is the Platonic tradition rather than Dante’s that has molded Michelangelo’s verse. In many ways no sentiment could have been less like Dante’s love for Beatrice than Michelangelo’s for Vittoria Colonna. Dante’s comes in early youth: Beatrice is a child, with the wistful, ambiguous vision of a child, with a character still unaccentuated by the influence of outward circumstances, almost expressionless. Vittoria, on the other hand, is a woman already weary, in advanced age, of grave intellectual qualities. Dante’s story is a piece of figured work, inlaid with lovely incidents. In Michelangelo’s poems, frost and fire are almost the only images—the refining fire of the goldsmith; once or twice the phoenix; ice melting at the fire; fire struck from the rock which it afterwards consumes. Except one doubtful allusion to a journey, there are almost no incidents. But there is much of the bright, sharp, unerring skill, with which in boyhood he gave the look of age to the head of a faun by chipping a tooth from its jaw with a single stroke of the hammer. For Dante, the amiable and de vout materialism of the middle age, sanctifies all that is presented by hand and eye; while Michelangelo is always pressing forward from the outward beauty—il bel del fuor che agli occhi piace, to apprehend the unseen beauty; trascenda nella forma universale—that abstract form of beauty, about which the Platonists reason. And this gives the impression in him of something f lit ting and unfixed, of the houseless and complaining spirit, almost clairvoyant through the frail and yielding flesh. He accounts for love at first sight by a previous state of existence— la dove io t’ amai prima. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管如此，他和但丁也有很多相似之处。他很接近原始的形象，超越了那些紧跟在彼特拉克身后，但又无力的模仿者。他从但丁而非柏拉图那里学到：对爱人来说沉溺于欲望，并不比在贫困中充满希望更快乐。他在重复温柔和优雅的话语时，在把爱人格化时，在仔细思考心爱的对象的出现对脉搏和心脏的身体反应时回想到自己。最重要的是他在政治言论的热情和强烈方面和但丁相像，因为，他最出色的十四行诗中的一首，按最初理解，里面的女士是佛罗伦萨城的化身；并且他主张，如果她作为成千上万个人的情人被创造成“天使般的外表”，却被一个人，比如说某位皮耶罗或者亚历桑德罗·德·美第奇据为己有的话，天堂中的一切肯定都是处在沉睡之中。他屡次提出爱情和死亡，两者的争执涉及到他。因为他和但丁以及所有意大利高贵的灵魂一样，心里装满死亡的念头，死亡是他真正的情人。一开始，死亡是所有悲伤和耻辱中最糟的一个，化为灵魂的一块泥淖之地。后来，死亡有了很大的区别，它超然于庸俗的需要之外，生命和行为的愤怒的污点迅速地剥离开去。</td>
		<td class="en">And yet there are many points in which he is really like Dante, and comes very near to the original image, beyond those later and feebler followers in the wake of Petrarch. He learns from Dante rather than from Plato, that for lovers, the surfeiting of desire—ove gran desir gran copia affrena, is a state less happy than poverty with abundance of hope—una miseria di speranza piena. He recalls him in the repetition of the words gentile and cortesia, in the personif ication of Amor, in the tendency to dwell minutely on the physical effects of the presence of a beloved object on the pulses and the heart. Above all, he resembles Dante in the warmth and intensity of his political utterances, for the lady of one of his noblest sonnets was from the first understood to be the city of Florence; and he avers that all must be asleep in heaven, if she, who was created “of angelic form,” for a thousand lovers, is appropriated by one alone, some Piero, or Alessandro de’ Medici. Once and again he introduces Love and Death, who dispute concerning him. For, like Dante and all the nobler souls of Italy, he is much occupied with thoughts of the grave, and his true mistress is death—death at first as the worst of all sorrows and disgraces, with a clod of the field for its brain; afterwards, death in its high distinction, its detachment from vulgar needs, the angry stains of life and action escaping fast.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Some of those whom the gods love die young. This man, because the gods loved him, lingered on to be of immense, patriarchal age, till the sweetness it had taken so long to secrete in him was found at last. Out of the strong came forth sweetness, ex forti dulcedo. The world had changed around him. The “new Catholicism” had taken the place of the Renaissance. The spirit of the Roman Church had changed: in the vast world’s cathedral which his skill had helped to raise for it, it looked stronger than ever. Some of the first members of the Oratory were among his intimate associates. They were of a spirit as unlike as possible from that of Lorenzo, or Savonarola even. The opposition of the Reformation to art has been often enlarged upon; far greater was that of the Catholic revival. But in thus fixing itself in a frozen orthodoxy, the Roman Church had passed beyond him, and he was a stranger to it. In earlier days, when its beliefs had been in a fluid state, he too might have been drawn into the controversy. He might have been for spiritualising the papal sovereignty, like Savonarola; or for adjusting the dreams of Plato and Homer with the words of Christ, like Pico of Mirandola. But things had moved onward, and such adjustments were no longer possible. For himself, he had .long since fallen back on that divine ideal, which above the wear and tear of creeds has been forming itself for ages as the possession of nobler souls. And now he began to feel the soothing influence which since that time the Roman Church has often exerted over spirits too independent to be its subjects, yet brought within the neighborhood of its action; consoled and tranquillised, as a traveller might be, resting for one evening in a strange city, by its stately aspect and the sentiment of its many fortunes, just because with those fortunes he has nothing to do. So he lingers on; a revenant, as the French say, a ghost out of another age, in a world too coarse to touch his faint sensibilities very closely; dreaming, in a worn- out society, theatrical in its life, theatrical in its art, theatrical even in its devotion, on the morning of the world’s history, on the primitive form of man, on the images under which that primitive world had conceived of spiritual forces. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">I have dwelt on the thought of Michelangelo as thus lingering beyond his time in a world not his own, be cause, if one is to distinguish the peculiar savor of his work, he must be approached, not through his followers, but through his predecessors; not through the marbles of Saint Peter’s, but through the work of the sculptors of the fifteenth century over the tombs and altars of Tuscany. He is the last of the Florentines, of those on whom the peculiar sentiment of the Florence of Dante and Giotto descended: he is the consummate representative of the form that sentiment took in the fifteenth century with men like Luca Signorelli and Mino da Fiesole. Up to him the tradition of sentiment is unbroken, the progress towards surer and more mature methods of expressing that sentiment continuous. But his professed disciples did not share this temper; they are in love with his strength only, and seem not to feel his grave and temperate sweetness. Theatricality is their chief characteristic; and that is a quality as little attributable to Michelangelo as to Mino or Luca Signorelli. With him, as with them, all is serious, passionate, impulsive. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >米开朗琪罗这种门徒的身份，他对佛罗伦萨流派传统的依赖，在对《创世记》的处理中表现得最为明显。“上帝造人”像梦幻一般萦绕在中世纪的思维中。意大利雕塑家把它融汇进石柱顶部或门口的上百个雕塑装饰品中，早就给它赋予了具有很多隐含意义的丰富的表达。和中世纪其他艺术概念一样，对于它的处理方法几乎变成了惯例：在艺术家中传递下去，只有些微的改变，直到它自己几乎变成了一种独立、抽象的存在形式。因此这就成了中世纪思维的特色：赋予一个特定的图示概念，或是传奇故事，比如特里斯坦或汤豪泽的传奇，甚至是一本书的思想或内容，比如《效仿基督》以独立的传统的存在形式，这样没有哪位艺术家可以宣称它独属于自己。这本书、这个意象或者这个传奇本身都有了自己的传奇，有了自己的命运和历史。因此，这也是米开朗琪罗属于中世纪的标志。他从传统中获得他的中心思想，进行最后的打磨，把它转化成西斯廷教堂的壁画。</td>
		<td class="en">This discipleship of Michelangelo, this dependence of his on the tradition of the Florentine schools, is nowhere seen more clearly than in his treatment of the Creation. The Creation of Man had haunted the mind of the middle age like a dream; and weaving it into a hundred carved ornaments of capital, or doorway, the Italian sculptors had early impressed upon it that pregnancy of expression which seems to give it many veiled meanings. As with other artistic conceptions of the middle age, its treatment became almost conventional, handed on from artist to artist, with slight changes, till it came to have almost an independent and abstract existence of its own. It was characteristic of the medieval mind thus to give an independent traditional existence to a special pictorial conception, or to a legend, like that of Trist ram or Tannhäuser, or even to the very thoughts and substance of a book, like the Imitation, so that no single workman could claim it as his own, and the book, the image, the legend, had itself a legend, and its fortunes, and a personal history; and it is a sign of the medievalism of Michelangelo, that he thus receives from tradition his central conception, and does but add the last touches, in transferring it to the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是还有另外一种传统，是早期更为严肃的佛罗伦萨人的传统。米开朗琪罗继承下来，对它进行了最后的表达。这种传统在圣洛伦佐圣器安置所的装饰中占中心地位，像《创世记》的传统占据了西斯廷教堂中心那样。据说所有伟大的佛罗伦萨人都因死亡而心事重重。走出坟444墓4！走出坟墓4444！从但丁到萨沃那洛拉，无一不以此为思想的负担。即使是快乐放荡的薄伽丘，也借一群在郊外住所里躲避瘟疫的人，从他们口中表达出来，使故事更加有趣。因这种遗传的情感，这种因死亡而忧虑不安的现实思想本身也越发高贵，成为一种高品质的表现，所以15世纪佛罗伦萨伟人的严肃认真从一定程度上来说是应该的，而且他们所处时代的真正悲伤也使得它变得更强烈。他们曾经多少次看到生命以各种不同方式在街道上、房子里被击垮。美丽的西莫内塔早早夭折，下葬到坟墓里，连脸都没有盖上。年轻的红衣主教雅各布·迪·波托加洛在去佛罗伦萨的途中死掉。卓越的外表和亲切的谦逊同在——他的墓志铭居然这样写道。安东尼奥·罗塞利诺在圣米尼阿托教堂雕刻他的坟墓时，非常重视手脚和圣衣的美观。卢卡·德拉·罗比亚把他最好的作品放在那儿，而且这个年轻高贵的高级教士的坟墓成为了这个奇异美丽的地方的最奇异美丽的东西。帕齐阴谋家被执行死刑后，波提切利受雇去给他们画肖像。这种带着严肃思想和悲伤形象的全神贯注可能容易引发某种结果，而且事实也是如此：它在莱茵河畔的阴沉村庄或是中世纪巴黎拥挤的街区，就如现在仍在阿尔卑斯山脉的许多村庄里一样，只引起一些病态怪异的东西，在许多法国和德国画家笔下描绘的“死亡之舞”，或是丢勒那种可怕作品中出现。在这样的影响下，15世纪佛罗伦萨的大师们被意大利文化的高贵，更被他们对事物本身的温情怜悯拯救了。当一切归于平静之后，他们必定常常俯身在无生命的尸体上。据说死后，较肤浅的、更为表面的本性痕迹会消失，线条变得更加简单高贵，只有抽象的线条冷漠地存在着。因此他们从其差异之处看待死亡。然后可能会更进一步，思考一下这种转瞬即逝的尊严必须分解的情况，模模糊糊地分辨出一个新的躯体，他们会适时停顿下来，带着深沉的怜悯刻意回避。</td>
		<td class="en">But there was another tradition of those earlier, more serious Florentines, of which Michelangelo is the inherit or, to which he gives the final expression, and which centres in the sacristy of San Lorenzo, as the tradition of the Creation centres in the Sistine Chapel. It has been said that all the great Florentines were preoccupied with death. Outre-tombe! Outre-tombe!—is the bur den of their thoughts, from Dante to Savonarola. Even the gay and licentious Boccaccio gives a keener edge to his stories by putting them in the mouths of a party of people who had taken refuge in a country-house from the danger of death by plague. It was to this inherited sentiment, this practical decision that to be preoccupied with the thought of death was in itself dignifying, and a note of high quality, that the seriousness of the great Florentines of the fifteenth century was partly due; and it was reinforced in them by the actual sorrows of their times. How often, and in what various ways, had they seen life stricken down, in their streets and houses. La bella Simonetta dies in early youth, and is borne to the grave with uncovered face. The young Cardinal Jacopo di Portogallo dies on a visit to Florence—insignis forma fui et mirabili modestia—his epitaph dares to say. Antonio Rossellino carves his tomb in the church of San Miniato, with care for the shapely hands and feet, and sacred attire; Luca della Robbia puts his skyiest works there; and the tomb of the youthful and princely prelate became the strangest and most beautiful thing in that strange and beautiful place. After the execution of the Pazzi conspirators, Botticelli is employed to paint their portraits. This preoccupation with serious thoughts and sad images might easily have resulted, as it did, for instance, in the gloomy villages of the Rhine, or in the overcrowded parts of medieval Paris, as it still does in many a village of the Alps, in something merely morbid or grotesque, in the Danse Macabre of many French and German painters, or the grim inventions of Dürer. From such a result the Florentine masters of the fifteenth century were saved by the nobility of their Italian culture, and still more by their tender pity for the thing itself. They must, often have leaned over the lifeless body, when all was at length quiet and smoothed out. After death, it is said, the traces of slighter and more superficial dispositions disappear; the lines become more simple and dignified; only the abstract lines remain, in a great indifference. They came thus to see death in its distinction. Then following it perhaps one stage further, dwelling for a moment on the point where all this transitory dignity must break up, and discerning with no clearness a new body, they paused just in time, and abstained, with a sentiment of profound pity. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >米开朗琪罗表现了所有这些情感，其中首先是怜惜之情。在《圣母恸子》中，圣母面对死去的耶稣基督的躯体的怜悯，延伸成所有母亲对死去儿子的怜悯。埋葬，包裹在冷冰冰的“坚硬的石头”中—是他偏爱的主题。他把这个主题放进多种形式里，比如素描、半完成的设计、完成和未完成的群雕；但那种悲伤总是绝望的、灰暗的、几乎是异教式的悲伤——没有神圣的悲伤，有的只是对僵硬的四肢、苍白嘴唇的怜悯和敬畏。牛津有一幅他的画，画中的尸体在母亲双脚间垂到地上，手臂还耷拉到她的膝盖上。圣洛伦佐圣器安置所的坟墓，不属于美第奇家族哪个高贵伟大的成员，而是朱利亚诺和小洛伦佐的纪念碑，引人注意的主要是他们有些过早的夭亡。因此，纯粹是人类的天性触发了这种情感。传统上分给四个象征人物的名称《夜》与《昼》、《晨》和《昏》对于它们而言界定过窄。因为这些人物与它们作者的思想和精神更加接近，比任何单纯的象征性概念更能直接表现他的思想。它们更多的是通过触动，而非明确的概念，而专注于并且表现一段音乐的激励，表现其中所有那些模糊的幻想、疑虑和预感。每当思维想要认真地把它们固定在脱离肉体的精神的条件和环境下时，它们总是在变换、混合、被界定，然后重又消失。我想没人会去圣洛伦佐的圣物安置所寻找慰藉。他们可能去寻求严肃、庄重和尊严的印迹，但不会去寻求慰藉。那是一个既不能安慰人，也没有可怖思想，而是有着茫然和惆怅的思索的地方。在这里，米开朗琪罗更像是柏拉图学派的弟子，而非但丁的门徒。但丁对不朽的信仰是刻板的、准确的和坚定的，就像一个孩子，认为如果哭的声音足够大，死者就能听到似的。在米开朗琪罗身上，你看到的是成熟，是一个慎重冷静地对待严肃事物的成年人的思想。他所抱的希望建立在对无知的觉悟上：对人的无知，对思维的本质的无知，对其起源和能力的无知。米开朗琪罗对于宗教世界、对它新的体系和法则如此不了解，以至于他不能确定圣餐的圣饼是不是耶稣基督的身体。在所有这些情感中，他是诗人，一位健在的诗人，掌握着我们最秘密的思想——这是种无声的质询，询问那种死后重新回复到生命存在之前的无形状态，变化、变化引发的反抗，然后是对怜惜的修正、神圣化、感到慰藉的冲动；最终在远处出现，稀薄，但不比人类在3个世纪里所拥有的、关于与他们心灵如此之近的最确切思想更为蒙眬：新的身体——一束转瞬即逝的光，对于那些过于刚硬、或者几乎不成型的面庞的一种几乎无法触及的外在的效果；一个徘徊片刻便在黎明时分退却、没有完成、没有目标也没人帮助的梦想；一件有着模糊的听力、蒙眬的记忆、几乎无力触摸的东西；一缕呼吸、门口的一束火焰、亦或风中的一根羽毛。</td>
		<td class="en">Of all this sentiment Michelangelo is the achievement; and, first of all, of pity. Pietà, pity, the pity of the Virgin Mother over the dead body of Christ, expanded into the pity of all mothers over all dead sons, the entombment, with its cruel “hard stones”:—this is the subject of his predilection. He has left it in ,many forms, sketches, half-finished designs, finished and unfinished groups of sculpture; but always as a hopeless, rayless, almost heathen sorrow—no divine sorrow, but mere pity and awe at the stiff limbs and colorless lips. There is a drawing of his at Oxford, in which the dead body has sunk to the earth between the mother’s feet, with the arms extended over her knees. The tombs in the sacristy of San Lorenzo are memorials, not of any of the nobler and greater Medici, but of Giuliano, and Lorenzo the younger, noticeable chiefly for their somewhat early death. It is mere human nature, therefore, which has prompted the sentiment here. The titles assigned traditionally to the four symbolical figures, Night and Day, The Twilight and The Dawn, are far too definite for them: for these figures come much nearer to the mind and spirit of their author, and are a more direct expression of his thoughts, than any merely symbolical conceptions could possibly have been. They concentrate and express, less by way of definite conceptions than by the touches, the promptings of a piece of music, all those vague fancies, misgivings, presentiments, which shift and mix and are defined and fade again, whenever the thoughts try to f ix themselves with sincerity on the conditions and surroundings of the disembodied spirit. I suppose no one would come to the sacristy of San Lo renzo for consolation; for seriousness, for solemnity, for dignity of impression, perhaps, but not for consolation. It is a place neither of consoling nor of terrible thoughts, but of vague and wistful speculation. Here, again, Michelangelo is the disciple not so much of Dante as of the Platonists. Dante’s belief in immortality is for mal, precise and firm, almost as much so as that of a child, who thinks the dead will hear if you cry loud enough. But in Michelangelo you have maturity, the mind of the grown man, dealing cautiously and dispassionately with serious things, and what hope he has is based on the consciousness of ignorance—ignorance of man, ignorance of the nature of the mind, its origin and capacities. Michelangelo is so ignorant of the spiritual world, of the new body and its laws, that he does not surely know whether the consecrated Host may not be the body of Christ. And of all that range of sentiment he is the poet, a poet still alive, and in possession of our inmost thoughts—dumb inquiry over the relapse after death into the formlessness which preceded life, the change, the revolt from that change, then the correcting, hallowing, consoling rush of pity; at last, far off, thin and vague, yet not more vague than the most definite thoughts men have had through three centuries on a matter that has been so near their hearts, the new body—a passing light, a mere intangible, external effect, over those too rigid, or too formless faces; a dream that lingers a moment, retreating in the dawn, incomplete, aimless, helpless; a thing with faint hearing, faint memory, faint power of touch; a breath, a f lame in the door way, a feather in the wind. </td></tr>

But when once we have succeeded in defining for ourselves those characteristics, and the law of their combination, we have acquired a standard or measure which helps us to put in its right place many a vagrant genius, many an unclassified talent, many precious though imperfect products of art. It is so with the components of the true character of Michelangelo. That strange interfusion of sweetness and strength is not to be found in those who claimed to be his followers; but it is found in many of those who worked before him, and in many others down to our own time, in William Blake, for in stance, and Victor Hugo, who, though not of his school, and unaware, are his true sons, and help us to understand him as he in turn interprets and justifies them. Perhaps this is the chief use in studying old masters.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦萨里的《列奥纳多·达·芬奇的一生》，我们现在所读的版本与第一版相比有了一些变化。在第一版里，为此后几个世纪里设定了基督的外在典型形象的画家是一个大胆的投机者，被其他人的信仰所轻轻托举，把哲学置于基督教教义之上。他那些犀利尖锐、足可以证明这样印象的话没有被记载下来，并且本来也会与一种天赋不符，这天赋的一个特点就是在一种精致、优雅的神秘中迷失自我的倾向。这种观念由来已久：世界把对只为自己着想、对一切漠不关心和对事物的一般形式不能容忍之人的欣赏表现出来。在第二版里，这个形象变得更为模糊，也更为传统。但还是他作品里的某种神秘，以及一些超出了通常意义的伟大人物的玄妙费解之物使他让人着迷，或者可能使人半怀厌恶。他的一生是一种突然的反叛，其中有一些间隙根本未进行创作，或者远离主要的创作范围。某种奇怪的命运使他更具名气的画作，比如说《安吉里之战》，早早在世界上消失无踪，或是和出自粗陋之手的作品令人费解地混在了一起，比如《最后的晚餐》。他的那种美有着浓郁的异域风情，以至于他给人带来的更多的是炫惑，而非愉悦，并且比其他任何艺术家更能反映出内在的想法、观点和某种世界格局。所以，在同时代的人眼中，他似乎具有某种渎神的、隐秘的智慧，对米什莱和其他人来说，他预测了现代的思想。他视自己的天赋如儿戏，在晚期饱受折磨的几年里集中创作了所有主要的作品。然而他又是如此沉迷于自己的天赋，以至于经历那些最悲惨的事情却无动于衷，就像一位担负某项秘密任务偶然经过的人一样，让他的国家和朋友不知所措。</td>
		<td class="en">IN Vasari’s life of Leonardo da Vinci as we now read it there are some variations from the first edition. There, the painter who has fixed the outward type of Christ for succeeding centuries was a bold speculator, holding lightly by other men’s beliefs, setting philosophy above Christianity. Words of his, trenchant enough to justify this impression, are not recorded, and would have been out of keeping with a genius of which one characteristic is the tendency to lose itself in a refined and graceful mystery. The suspicion was but the time- honored mode in which the world stamps its appreciation of one who has thoughts for himself alone, his high indifference, his intolerance of the common forms of things; and in the second edition the image was changed into something fainter and more conventional. But it is still by a certain mystery in his work, and some thing enigmatical beyond the usual measure of great men, that he fascinates, or perhaps half repels. His life is one of sudden revolts, with intervals in which he works not at all, or apart from the main scope of his work. By a strange fortune the pictures on which his more popular fame rested disappeared early from the world, like the Battle of the Standard1; or are mixed obscurely with the product of meaner hands, like the Last Supper. His type of beauty is so exotic that it fascinates a larger number than it delights, and seems more than that of any other artist to reflect ideas and views and some scheme of the world within; so that he seemed to his contemporaries to be the possessor of some unsanctified and secret wisdom; as to Michelet2 and others to have anticipated modern ideas. He trifles with his genius, and crowds all his chief work into a few tormented years of later life; yet he is so possessed by his genius that he passes unmoved through the most tragic events, overwhelming his country and friends, like one who comes across them by chance on some secret errand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的传奇，像法国人说的那样，有着人人传诵的轶事，是瓦萨里书中最出彩的一章。后来的作家只是简单照搬，直到1804年卡洛·阿莫雷蒂对它进行了批判。批评涉及到几乎每一个确定的日期和所有的轶事。其中提出的各种各样的问题从那时起一个接一个变成了专门研究的主题，在这个方向纯粹的古物研究已经基本无事可做。余下的工作则是编辑达·芬奇的13本手稿，通过技术性的批评区分哪些归于他名下的著作真正属于他，哪些他只是创作了一半，哪些是他学生的作品。但是热爱不可思议的心灵的人可能还在分析那些作品对自己产生的影响，并且努力通过它界定列奥纳多天赋的主要成分。传奇被批评家们更正和丰富着，可能会不时介入来支持这种分析的结果。</td>
		<td class="en">His legend, as the French say, with the anecdotes which everyone remembers, is one of the most brilliant chapters of Vasari. Later writers merely copied it, until, in 1804, Carlo Amoretti applied to it a criticism which left hardly a date fixed, and not one of those anecdotes untouched. The various questions thus raised have since that time become, one after another, subject of special study, and mere antiquarianism has in this direction little more to do. For others remain the editing of the thirteen books of his manuscripts, and the separation by technical criticism of what in his reputed works is really his, from what is only half his, or the work of his pupils. But a lover of strange souls may still analyse for himself the impression made on him by those works, and try to reach through it a definition of the chief elements of Leonardo’s genius. The legend, as corrected and enlarged by its critics, may now and then intervene to support the results of this analysis.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">His life has three divisions—thirty years at Florence, nearly twenty years at Milan, then nineteen years of wandering, till he sinks to rest under the protection of Francis the First at the Château de Clou. The dishonor of illegitimacy hangs over his birth. Piero Antonio, his father, was of a noble Florentine house, of Vinci in the Val d’Arno, and Leonardo, brought up delicately among the true children of that house, was the love-child of his youth, with the keen, puissant nature such children often have. We see him in his boyhood fascinating all men by his beauty, improvising music and songs, buying the caged birds and setting them free, as he walked the streets of Florence, fond of odd bright dresses and spirited horses.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">From his earliest years he designed many objects, and constructed models in relief, of which Vasari mentions some of women smiling. His father, pondering over this promise in the child, took him to the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, then the most famous artist in Florence. Beautiful objects lay about there—reliquaries, pyxes, silver images for the pope’s chapel at Rome, strange fancy-work of the middle age, keeping odd company with fragments of antiquity, then but lately discovered. Another student Leonardo may have seen there—a lad into whose soul the level light and aerial illusions of Italian sunsets had passed, in after days famous as Perugino3. Verrocchio was an artist of the earlier Florentine type, carver, painter, and worker in metals, in one; designer, not of pictures only, but of all things for sacred or household use, drinking-vessels, ambries, instruments of music, making them all fair to look upon, filling the common ways of life with the reflection of some far-off brightness; and years of patience had refined his hand till his work was now sought after from distant places.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For beneath the cheerful exterior of the mere well-paid craftsman, chasing brooches for the copes of Santa Maria Novella, or twisting metal screens for the tombs of the Medici, lay the ambitious desire to expand the destiny of Italian art by a larger knowledge and insight into things, a purpose in art not unlike Leonardo’s still unconscious purpose; and often, in the modelling of drapery, or of a lifted arm, or of hair cast back from the face, there came to him something of the freer manner and richer humanity of a later age. But in this Baptism the pupil had surpassed the master; and Verrocchio turned away as one stunned, and as if his sweet earlier work must thereafter be distasteful to him, from the bright animated angel of Leonardo’s hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在佛罗伦萨仍有可能看到那个天使。它是那幅冰冷、费力的陈旧作品中的一个亮点。但是传奇只在情感意义上是真实的，因为绘画是韦罗基奥最不重视的艺术。而且因为像在某种意义上他对列奥纳多期望的那样，列奥纳多谈到韦罗基奥的工作室的时候，谈到对漂亮的玩意儿的喜爱，比如当作镜子的水杯；在《谦虚与虚荣》中显示手的灵巧的精美的刺绣；喜爱浮雕，比如《天平圣母》中缀满圣米迦勒腰带的宝石；喜爱明亮的杂色石头，比如《圣安妮》中的玛瑙；以及那种僧侣式的一丝不苟和优雅，比如打扫干净、布置一新的修道院。在他伦巴第风格的巧妙复杂里，他从未放弃这一点，而且在已经失传的《伊甸园》这幅画中得到很多体现。《伊甸园》是他为一张准备用佛兰德斯织布机编织的挂毯准备的草图。它是早期佛罗伦萨式微型画的完美代表：耐心地把每一片叶子都安放在树上，每一朵花都放置进草丛里，第一个男人和第一个女人立于其中。</td>
		<td class="en">The angel may still be seen in Florence, a space of sunlight in the cold, labored old picture; but the legend is true only in sentiment, for painting had always been the art by which Verrocchio set least store. And as in a sense he anticipates Leonardo, so to the last Leonardo recalls the studio of Verrocchio, in the love of beautiful toys, such as the vessel of water for a mirror, and lovely needle-work about the implicated hands in the Modesty and Vanity, and of reliefs, like those cameos which in the Virgin of the Balances hang all round the girdle of Saint Michael, and of bright variegated stones, such as the agates in the Saint Anne, and in a hieratic preciseness and grace, as of a sanctuary swept and garnished. Amid all the cunning and intricacy of his Lombard manner this never left him. Much of it there must have been in that lost picture of Paradise, which he prepared as a cartoon for tapestry, to be woven in the looms of Flanders. It was the perfection of the older Florentine style of miniature-painting, with patient putting of each leaf upon the trees and each flower in the grass, where the first man and woman were standing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为它是那种风格的完美之作，所以引起了列奥纳多埋藏在内心秘密角落里某种不满的种子。因为达到完美的路上要经过一些令人厌恶的阶段。这幅画是他到此时在佛罗伦萨创作的唯一作品，采用的毕竟是古老的娇弱风格。他的艺术如果要在世界上占有一席之地，一定要有更多的自然的意义和人性的目的。自然是“高等智慧的真正女主人”，于是他投入到对自然的研究中。在这个过程中，他遵循过去研究者的方法。他沉浸在对植物和水晶隐藏的特质、对星体在天空中移动轨迹的思考中，沉浸在对不同种类生物间存在联系的思考中。对有观察力的人来说，它们通过这种联系彼此进行诠释。很多年里，在周围人的眼中，他似乎是在聆听其他人听不到的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">And because it was the perfection of that style, it awoke in Leonardo some seed of discontent which lay in the secret places of his nature. For the way to perfection is through a series of disgusts; and this picture—all that he had done so far in his life at Florence—was after all in the old slight manner. His art, if it was to be something in the world, must be weighted with more of the meaning of nature and purpose of humanity. Nature was “the true mistress of higher intelligences”. He plunged, then, into the study of nature. And in doing this he followed the manner of the older students; he brooded over the hidden virtues of plants and crystals, the lines traced by the stars as they moved in the sky, over the correspondences which exist between the different orders of living things, through which, to eyes opened, they interpret each other; and for years he seemed to those about him as one listening to a voice silent for other men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在此他学会了深入研究的技巧，到最隐秘的静修处追寻表现力的源泉，到他掌控的事物中追寻隐秘的存在的力量。他没有马上或是全部放弃他的艺术，只不过不再是一个快乐客观的画家。佛罗伦萨生活的明丽形象穿过这样的画家的心灵，就如同穿过透明的玻璃，打到白色的墙上时，只是在传送中变得有些许的柔和，又更加忧郁了。他在新奇的设计手法上浪费了很多天时间，仿佛要使自己迷失在线条和色彩的复杂构想的一团乱麻中。他因热衷于一些不可能的事而深受打击：他想给高山凿洞，给河流改道，把圣乔瓦尼教堂那样的高大建筑举向空中；自然魔力声称只有自己才掌握了完成这些功绩的钥匙。之后的作家的确在这些努力中看到了现代力学的雏形，但对他来说这些都更像是梦境，是过度劳累忙碌的大脑丢弃的梦境。有两个念头在他的头脑中特别地挥之不去，如同他童年时代比其他事物更深刻地触及了他的大脑的映象，那就是女人的微笑和强大水流的涌动。</td>
		<td class="en">He learned here the art of going deep, of tracking the sources of expression to their subtlest retreats, the power of an intimate presence in the things he handled. He did not at once or entirely desert his art; only he was no longer the cheerful, objective painter, through whose soul, as through clear glass, the bright figures of Florentine life, only made a little mellower and more pensive by the transit, passed on to the white wall. He wasted many days in curious tricks of design, seeming to lose himself in the spinning of intricate devices of line and color. He was smitten with a love of the impossible—the perforation of mountains, changing the course of rivers, raising great buildings, such as the church of San Giovanni, in the air; all those feats for the performance of which natural magic professed to have the key. Later writers, indeed, see in these ef forts an anticipation of modern mechanics; in him they were rather dreams, thrown off by the overwrought and laboring brain. Two ideas were especially confirmed in him, as reflexes of things that had touched his brain in childhood beyond the depth of other impressions—the smiling of women and the motion of great waters.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And in such studies some interfusion of the extremes of beauty and terror shaped itself, as an image that might be seen and touched, in the mind of this gracious youth, so fixed that for the rest of his life it never left him. As if catching glimpses of it in the strange eyes or hair of chance people, he would follow such about the streets of Florence till the sun went down, of whom many sketches of his remain. Some of these are full of a curious beauty, that remote beauty which may be apprehended only by those who have sought it carefully; who, starting with acknowledged types of beauty, have refined as far upon these, as these refine upon the world of common forms. But mingled inextricably with this there is an element of mockery also; so that, whether in sorrow or scorn, he caricatures Dante even. Legions of grotesques sweep under his hand; for has not nature, too, her grotesques—the rent rock, the distorting lights of evening on lonely roads, the unveiled structure of man in the embryo, or the skeleton?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一系列的奇思异想全部在乌菲兹美术馆的《美杜莎》里表现出来。瓦萨里有关早期画在木盾上的美杜莎的故事可能是编造出来的。然而，描述得当的话，它比整个传奇中其他任何情节都更具真实感。因为它的真正主题不是成人的严肃作品，而是一个孩子的试验之作。蜥蜴、萤火虫和其他奇异的小生物在意大利葡萄园里出没，把一个孩子在托斯卡纳住所里的生活画卷展现在人们面前。这里半是城堡，半是农庄。小生物对自然来说再真实不过，这和父亲见到小男孩精心准备的惊喜假装出来的惊讶一样真实。他并非是出于玩耍，画出了另一个美杜莎,这幅伟大作品被保留在佛罗伦萨。人们以各种方式表现着这个主题，只有列奥纳多直接指向它的中心。只有他将其展现为尸体的头颅，通过所有死亡的情境来体现它的力量。这种“腐朽之魔力”在每一笔中渗入它极致的美。蝙蝠悄然掠过线条优美的脸颊，细软的毒蛇展开惨烈的争斗，似乎要相互扼杀，以从美杜莎的头上逃开。五官上带有那种惨死之人常有的色调：当我们运用灵活的透视缩图法反过来看时，五官大得异乎寻常，尤其是头顶，就像一块平静的巨石毒蛇如浪，飞溅其上。</td>
		<td class="en">All these swarming fancies unite in the Medusa of the Uflizii. Vasari’s story of an earlier Medusa, painted on a wooden shield, is perhaps an invention; and yet, properly told, has more of the air of truth about it than anything else in the whole legend. For its real subject is not the serious work of a man, but the experiment of a child. The lizards and glow- worms and other strange small creatures which haunt an Italian vineyard bring before one the whole picture of a child’s life in a Tus can dwelling— half castle, half farm—and are as true to nature as the pretended astonishment of the father for whom the boy has prepared a surprise. It was not in play that he painted that other Medusa, the one great picture which he left behind him in Florence. The subject has been treated in various ways; Leonardo alone cuts to its centre; he alone realises it as the head of a corpse, exercising its powers through all the circum stances of death. What may be called the fascination of corruption penetrates in every touch its exquisitely finished beauty. About the dainty lines of the cheek the bat flits unheeded. The delicate snakes seem literally strangling each other in terrified struggle to escape from the Medusa brain. The hue which violent death always brings with it is in the features; features singularly massive and grand, as we catch them inverted, in a dexterous foreshortening, crown foremost, like a great calm stone against which the wave of serpents breaks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个时代的科学完全是预言和洞察力，它们独立于我们精确的现代公式之外，在一瞬间的幻象中寻求集合成千上万次的体验。后来的作家们只考虑到一篇关于绘画的组织精当的文章，由此想像出一种僵化的顺序。这篇文章是百年之后一个叫拉法埃莱·迪弗伦的法国人根据列奥纳多令人困惑的手稿编辑整理的：书稿怪异地按他自己由右到左的方式书写。但这种僵化顺序和他永不安分的个性非常不符。如果我们把他当成是一个让设计服从解剖学、让写作符合数学规则的纯粹理性的人，我们几乎无法得到列奥纳多身旁的人对他的印象了。他注视着坩埚，用色彩做试验，带着一种炼金术士的梦想的奇特变种追寻着秘密：不是使人自然生命不朽的长生不老药的秘密，而是要让绘画中最为精美细腻、美妙绝伦的效果保持不朽。对他们来说他就是巫师或者说是魔法师，掌控着新奇的秘密和不为人知的学问，生活在一个只有他才拥有钥匙的世界里。在哲学上他似乎和帕拉切尔苏斯和卡丹最为相像。古老的炼金术的精神依然徘徊其中，相信通过捷径和旁门左道可以获得知识。对他来说，哲学应该要提供超常的敏捷性和双倍的洞察力，预见到地下奔涌的清泉或是人类面容之下的表情，可以透视出平凡或不平凡事物中玄妙的天赋，比如溪边的一支芦苇或是一个世纪才靠近我们一次的星体。就这样我们只能模糊地看到,明确的目标是如何变得模糊，雕塑师的手法如何变得迷惑。列奥纳多一生中从未消失的神秘在此也达到顶点。但确定的是，在人生的某一阶段，他几乎终止了自己的艺术生涯。</td>
		<td class="en">The science of that age was all divination, clairvoyance, unsubjected to our exact modern formulas, seeking in an instant of vision to concentrate a thousand experiences. Later writers, thinking only of the well-ordered treatise on painting which a Frenchman, Raffaelle du Fresne, a hundred years afterwards, compiled from Leonardo’s bewildered manuscripts, written strangely, as his manner was, from right to left, have imagined a rigid order in his inquiries. But this rigid order would have been little in accordance with the restlessness of his character; and if we think of him as the mere reasoner who subjects design to anatomy, and composition to mathematical rules, we shall hardly have that impression which those around Leonardo received from him. Poring over his crucibles, making experiments with color, trying, by a strange variation of the alchemist’s dream, to discover the secret, not of an elixir to make man’s natural life immortal, but of giving immortality to the subtlest and most delicate effects of painting, he seemed to them rather the sorcerer or the magician, possessed of curious secrets and a hidden knowledge, living in a world of which he alone possessed the key. What his philosophy seems to have been most like is that of Paracelsus4 or Cardan5; and much of the spirit of the older alchemy still hangs about it, with its confidence in short cuts and odd byways to knowledge. To him philosophy was to be something giving strange swiftness and double sight, divining the sources of springs beneath the earth or of expression beneath the human countenance, clairvoyant of occult gifts in common or uncommon things, in the reed at the brook side, or the star which draws near to us but once in a century. How, in this way, the clear purpose was over clouded, the fine chaser’s hand perplexed, we but dimly see; the mystery which at no point quite lifts from Leon ardo’s life is deepest here. But it is certain that at one period of his life he had almost ceased to be an artist.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The year 1483—the year of the birth of Raphael and the thirty-first of Leonardo’s life—is fixed as the date of his visit to Milan by the letter in which he recommends himself to Ludovico Sforza6, and offers to tell him, for a price, strange secrets in the art of war. It was that Sforza who murdered his young nephew by slow poison, yet was so susceptible of religious impressions that he blended mere earthly passion with a sort of religious sentimentalism, and who took for his device the mulberry-tree—symbol, in its long delay and sudden yielding of f lowers and fruit together, of a wisdom which economises all forces for an opportunity of sudden and sure effect. The fame of Leonardo had gone before him, and he was to model a colossal statue of Francesco, the first Duke of Milan. As for Leonardo himself, he came not as an artist at all, or careful of the fame of one; but as a player on the harp, a strange harp of silver of his own construction, shaped in some curious likeness to a horse’s skull. The capricious spirit of Ludovico was susceptible also to the power of music, and Leonardo’s nature had a kind of spell in it. Fascination is always the word descriptive of him. No portrait of his youth remains; but all tends to make us believe that up to this time some charm of voice and aspect, strong enough to balance the disadvantage of his birth, had played about him. His physical strength was great; it was said that he could bend a horseshoe like a coil of lead.</td></tr>

In this return to nature, he was seeking to satisfy a bound less curiosity by her perpetual surprises, a microscopic sense of finish by her finesse, or delicacy of operation, that subtilitas naturae which Bacon notices. So we find him often in intimate relations with men of science,—with Fra Luca Paccioli the mathematician, and the anatomist Marc Antonio della Torre. His observations and experiments fill thirteen volumes of manuscript; and those who can judge describe him as anticipating long before, by rapid intuition, the later ideas of science. He explained the obscure light of the unilluminated part of the moon, knew that the sea had once covered the mountains which contain shells, and of the gathering of the equatorial waters above the polar.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He who thus penetrated into the most secret parts of nature preferred always the more to the less remote, what, seeming exceptional, was an instance of law more refined, the construction about things of a peculiar atmosphere and mixed lights. He paints flowers with such curious felicity that different writers have attributed to him a fondness for particular flowers, as Clement the cyclamen, and Rio the jasmin; while, at Venice, there is a stray leaf from his portfolio dotted all over with studies of violets and the wild rose. In him first appears the taste for what is bizarre or recherché in landscape; hollow places full of the green shadow of bituminous rocks, ridged reefs of trap-rock which cut the water into quaint sheets of light,—their exact antitype is in our own western seas; all the solemn effects of moving water. You may follow it springing from its distant source among the rocks on the heath of the Madonna of the Balances, passing, as a little fall, into the treacherous calm of the Madonna of the Lake, as a goodly river next, below the cliffs of the Madonna of the Rocks, washing the white walls of its distant villages, stealing out in a network of divided streams in La Gioconda7 to the seashore of the Saint Anne—that delicate place, where the wind passes like the hand of some fine etcher over the surface, and the untorn shells are lying thick upon the sand, and the tops of the rocks, to which the waves never rise, are green with grass, grown fine as hair. It is the landscape, not of dreams or of fancy, but of places far withdrawn, and hours selected from a thousand with a miracle offinesse. Through Leonardo’s strange veil of sight things reach him so; in no ordinary night or day, but as in faint light of eclipse, or in some brief interval of falling rain at daybreak, or through deep water.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And not into nature only; but he plunged also into human personality, and became above all a painter of portraits; faces of a modelling more skilful than has been seen before or since, embodied with a reality which almost amounts to illusion, on the dark air. To take a character as it was, and delicately sound its stops, suited one so curious in observation, curious in invention. He painted thus the portraits of Ludovico’s mistresses, Lu cretia Crivelli and Cecilia Galerani the poetess, of Lu dovico himself, and the Duchess Beatrice. The portrait of Cecilia Galerani is lost, but that of Lucretia Crivelli has been identified with La Belle Feronière of the Louvre, and Ludovico’s pale, anxious face still remains in the Ambrosian library. Opposite is the portrait of Beatrice d’Este, in whom Leonardo seems to have caught some presentiment of early death, painting her precise and grave, full of the refinement of the dead, in sad earth-colored raiment, set with pale stones.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时这种好奇心和对美的渴望相冲突。它往往令他过分深入事物内部，而偏离了本是艺术真正开始和结束之处的事物表面。这种理性和它的观点、感觉以及对美的渴望之间的挣扎对理解米兰时期的列奥纳多至关重要——他的躁动不安、反复润饰和奇怪的色彩试验。他留下了多少未完成的作品，又重新开始了多少创作！他的问题是怎样把想法转化成形象。到目前为止他所掌握的是早期佛罗伦萨风格那种纯朴的、有限度的激发美感的表现手法。现在他要在这个狭窄的媒介里表现比它宽泛太多的人性预言，那种着眼开放世界的更宽广的视野只适合莎士比亚伟大而不同常规的艺术。他手里的作品无处不体现着这种努力。这种躁动，这种无穷无尽的拖延让他显得疲惫、倦怠。其他人看来他好像是在树立一个不可能实现的目标，想达到艺术，确切的说是绘画永远不可能实现的效果。这样的尝试在表现身体美的时候常会使其扭曲，正如那些笨重的德国式额头——对完美来说太过沉重、太过德国化了。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes this curiosity came in conflict with the de sire of beauty; it tended to make him go too far below that outside of things in which art really begins and ends. This struggle between the reason and its ideas, and the senses, the desire of beauty, is the key to Leonardo’s life at Milan—his restlessness, his endless retouchings, his odd experiments with color. How much must he leave unfinished, how much recommence! His problem was the transmutation of ideas into images. What he had attained so far had been the mastery of that earlier Florentine style, with its naive and limited sensuousness. Now he was to entertain in this narrow medium those divinations of a humanity too wide for it, that larger vision of the opening world, which is only not too mud for the great, irregular art of Shakespeare; and every where the effort is visible in the work of his hands. This agitation, this perpetual delay, give him an air of weariness and ennui. To others he seems to be aiming at an impossible effect, to do something that art, that painting, can never do. Often the expression of physical beauty at this or that point seems strained and marred in the effort, as in those heavy German fore heads—too heavy and German for perfect beauty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在他的天赋里还有一些德国风格，如歌德所说，“理论是灰色的。”例如，对雕塑或绘画哪个更为高雅这个问题的讨论，完全是当代德国的预言！（这个答案是多么高贵，多么典型的列奥纳多式的啊：艺术越让身体疲惫，越是可鄙的！）但是这里有他和德国人之间的差异：如果有所有那些玄妙的科学存在，德国人可能会认为不再需要其他什么了。歌德的名字本身就会令人想起，对艺术家来说过度的科学可能成为多么巨大的危险。这位在《亲和力》和《浮士德》的第一部分把想法转化成形象，这位进行过大量此种转换的人也并不是总能找到准确的字眼。在《浮士德》的第二部分，他给我们展现的是大量的自然科学，几乎完全不具备艺术的特质。不过列奥纳多一定要等到快乐的一刻到来才去工作，也就是等到惬意时光，这对富于想象力的人来说就是创作的时刻。他非常耐心地等待这一刻的来临，其他时间仅仅是这一刻的准备，或是它的余韵。很少有人像他那样如此审慎地把它们区分。因此在最经典的作品里也会有大量的瑕疵。但是对列奥纳多来说这种区分是绝对的，在惬意的一刻里魔法完成了：想法融入色彩和意象中：阴郁的神秘主义被精心加工成柔和优美的神秘，画作在满足灵魂的时刻也愉悦了视觉。</td>
		<td class="en">For there was a touch of Germany in that genius which, as Goethe said, had “thought itself weary”—müde sich gedacht. What an anticipation of modern Germany, for instance, in that debate on the question whether sculpture or painting is the nobler art (How princely, how characteristic of Leonardo, the answer, Quanto più, un’ arte porta seco fatica di corpo, tanto più è vile! )! But there is this difference between him and the German, that, with all that curious science, the German would have thought nothing more was needed. The name of Goethe himself reminds one how great for the artist may be the danger of over-much science; how Goethe, who, in the Elective Affinities and the first part of Faust, does transmute ideas into images, who wrought many such transmutations, did not invariably find the spell- word, and in the second part of Faust presents us with a mass of science which has almost no artistic character at all. But Leonardo will never work till the happy moment comes—that moment of bien-être, which to imaginative men is a moment of invention. On this he waits with a perfect patience; other moments are but a preparation, or after-taste of it. Few men distinguish between them as jealously as he. Hence so many flaws even in the choicest work. But for Leonardo the distinction is absolute, and, in the moment of bien-être, the alchemy complete: the idea is stricken into color and imagery: a cloudy mysticism is refined to a subdued and graceful mystery, and painting pleases the eye while it satisfies the soul.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种奇异之美在他的素描里尤其常见，主要表现在跳跃线条的抽象优美中。我们选取其中一些画来观察一阵。首先是佛罗伦萨时期的一幅素描——一个女人和一个小孩的头部并排布局，但却各自有其独立的轮廓。在素描中，在孩子脸庞更为饱满的曲线以及疲倦、苍老的脸上更尖锐更洗练的曲线中，首先表现出的，是很多苦楚。从中可以看出，这一定是孩子和他的母亲的头像。对母性的同情的确一直是列奥纳多的特色。在这幅画中，这种情感以孩子小巧、浑圆的肩膀表现的富含幽默的痛苦进一步显现出来。你可能会在一些素描中注意到一种相似的令人怜悯的力量：屈背而坐、双手托脸似在悲痛之中的年青人，在短暂休息间隙、难受地斜坐着的奴隶；在一小幅圣母子的画像里也可以感觉到，他们半带惊慌地瞥向一边，这时长着蝙蝠状翅膀的强大怪兽（这是列奥纳多最优秀的创造之一）突然从天而降抓起了在他们身边徘徊的凶猛野兽。但在此注意一下艺术里的独有成分吧：年轻人的发际线、奴隶把手臂放在头上的姿势以及孩子头部的曲线，这曲线沿着里面像是风蚀的贝壳那样细小的头颅流动。</td>
		<td class="en">This curious beauty is seen above all in his drawings, and in these chiefly in the abstract grace of the bounding lines. Let us take some of these drawings, and pause over them awhile; and, first, one of those at Florence—the heads of a woman and a little child, set side by side, but each in its own separate frame . First of all, there is much pathos in the reappearance, in the fuller curves of the face of the child, of the sharper, more chastened lines of the worn and older face, which leaves no doubt that the heads are those of a little child and its mother. A feeling for maternity is indeed al ways characteristic of Leonardo; and this feeling is further indicated here by the half-humorous pathos of the diminutive, rounded shoulders of the child. You may note a like pathetic power in drawings of a young man, seated in a stooping posture, his face in his hands, as in sorrow; of a slave sitting in an uneasy inclined attitude, in some brief interval of rest; of a small Ma donna and Child, peeping sideways in half-reassured terror, as a mighty griffin with batlike wings, one of Leonardo’s finest inventions, descends suddenly from the air to snatch up a great wild beast wandering near them. But note in these, as that which especially belongs to art, the contour of the young man’s hair, the poise of the slave’s arm above his head, and the curves of the head of the child, following the little skull within, thin and fine as some sea-shell worn by the wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >再以另外一幅头像为例，依旧充满伤感，却是另外一种伤感。这是以红色粉笔画就的小型肖像，只要是仔细看过罗浮宫内大师素描的人都会记得它。肖像的性别不好确定，面庞隐藏在自己头发的阴影里，面颊的轮廓处在强光下，眼睑和双唇艳丽饱满。还有一幅画被认为是同一个人孩童时的肖像，嘴唇干燥炽热，但在孩子气的宽松高腰、带着项链和垂饰的衣饰中，以及优美地束起的头发里有很多可爱的东西。我们可以追随这两幅画像中暗示的线索，把它们放在一起，并且在佛罗伦萨、威尼斯和米兰时期的绘画中追寻下去，建立起一个系列，会比其他任何东西更好地诠释列奥纳多女性美的典型。希罗底的女儿们奇异的头巾如此奇怪地打着结、包在一起来使漂亮的鹅蛋形脸庞显现出来。她们不是圣家族成员也不是拉弗尔手下的天使，她们是神视者，通过她们就像透过精密的仪器一样，可以使一个人了解到自然更微妙的力量，了解它们运作的模式、其中所有的魔力以及所有物质实体升华成精妙运作的更为高级的条件，这些运作使物质成为神经形式，而这一切只有最敏感的神经和最敏锐的感触才能追寻得到。好像在一些重要的作品中我们可以真正看到这些力量在人类肉体上的作用。一些人紧张、容易兴奋并总是带着某种无法解释的衰弱，他们似乎容易受到异常条件的影响，容易在普通空气中感受到他人感受不到的正在发生作用的能量，他们容易承载这种能量，并通过一系列秘密影响把它们传递给我们。</td>
		<td class="en">Take again another head, still more full of sentiment, but of a different kind, a little drawing in red chalk which everyone will remember who has examined at all carefully the drawings by old masters at the Louvre. It is a face of doubtful sex, set in the shadow of its own hair, the cheek-line in high light against it, with some thing voluptuous and full in the eye-lids and the lips. Another drawing might pass for the same face in child hood, with parched and feverish lips, but much sweetness in the loose, short-waisted childish dress, with necklace and bulla, and in the daintily bound hair. We might take the thread of suggestion which these two drawings offer, when thus set side by side, and, following it through the drawings at Florence, Venice, and Milan, construct a sort of series, illustrating better than any thing else Leonardo’s type of womanly beauty. Daughters of Herodias, with their fantastic head-dresses knot ted and folded so strangely to leave the dainty oval or the face disengaged, they are not of the Christian family, or of Raphael’s. They are the clairvoyants, through whom, as through delicate instruments, one becomes aware of the subtler forces of nature, and the modes of their action, all that is magnetic in it, all those finer conditions wherein material things rise to that subtlety of operation which constitutes them spiritual, where only the final nerve and the keener touch can follow. It is as if in certain significant examples we actually saw those forces at their work on human flesh. Nervous, electric, faint always with some inexplicable faintness, these people seem to be subject to exceptional conditions, to feel powers at work in the common air unfelt by others, to become, as it were, the receptacle of them and pass them on to us in a chain of secret influences.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在更多的年轻人头像中有一幅佛罗伦萨时期的作品，被认定为爱神的画像。这个年轻人的头像可能是安德烈亚·沙莱诺的肖像。列奥纳多很喜欢他卷曲的波浪式头发，他后来成了列奥纳多最喜爱的学生和随从。列奥纳多在米兰生活期间也许曾结识过不少人，但只有这段情感被记录下来。作为回报沙莱诺也把自己和列奥纳多完全紧密地联系在一起，以致于卢浮宫里的《圣安妮》被认定是沙莱诺创作的。这体现了列奥纳多挑选学生的通常标准：选择沙莱诺那样具有天生个人魅力或交际能力的，或是弗朗切斯科·梅尔奇那种出身高贵并且有着贵族化的生活习惯的人。因为他们拥有足够的天赋理解他的高深技艺，也已准备好为此而抹杀自己的个性。他和这些学生经常到梅尔奇在卡诺尼卡瓦普里奥的别墅隐居，他在那里即兴地写作和画素描，为当下工作，只为一小部分人工作，可能主要是为了他自己而工作。其他艺术家同样会无视现在或将来的掌声，处于忘我状态，或是因为他们将道德或政治目的放在艺术目标之上。但是对他而言，这种孤独的美的修养似乎附着于一种自爱，一种在艺术创作中除了艺术本身对一切的漠视。那些至今没人认识的奇异花朵和果实来源于他独特性情的秘密之处。对他而言，传达出的新颖的印象，编织出的精致的效果，这本身就是终点——一个完美的句点。</td>
		<td class="en">But among the more youthful heads there is one at Florence which Love chooses for its own—the head of a young man, which may well be the likeness of Andrea Salaino, beloved of Leonardo for his curled and waving hair—belli capelli ricci e inanellati—and afterwards his favorite pupil and servant. Of all the interests in living men and women which may have filled his life at Milan, this attachment alone is recorded. And in return Salaino identified himself so entirely with Leonardo, that the picture of Saint Anne, in the Louvre, has been attributed to him. It illustrates Leonardo’s usual choice of pupils, men of some natural charm of person or intercourse like Salaino, or men of birth and princely habits of life like Francesco Melzi—men with just enough genius to be capable of initiation into his secret, for the sake of which they were ready to efface their own individuality: Among them, retiring often to the villa of the Melzi at Canonica al Vaprio, he worked at his fugitive manuscripts and sketches, working for the present hour, and for a few only, perhaps chiefly for himself. Other artists have been as careless of present or future applause, in self-forgetfulness, or because they set moral or political ends above the ends of art; but in him this solitary culture of beauty seems to have hung upon a kind of self-love, and a carelessness in the work of art of all but art itself. Out of the secret places of a unique temperament he brought strange blossoms and fruits hitherto unknown; and for him, the novel impression conveyed, the exquisite effect woven, counted as an end in itself—a perfect end.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And these pupils of his acquired his manner so thoroughly, that though the number of Leonardo’s authentic works is very small indeed, there is a multitude of other men’s pictures through which we undoubtedly see him, and come very near to his genius. Sometimes, as in the little picture of the Madonna of the Balances, in which, from the bosom of His mother, Christ weighs the pebbles of the brook against the sins of men, we have a hand, rough enough by contrast, working upon some fine hint or sketch of his. Sometimes, as in the subjects of the Daughter of Herodias and the Head of John the Baptist, the lost originals have been reechoed and varied upon again and again by Luini8 and others. At other times the original remains, but has been a mere theme or motive, a type, of which the accessories might be modified or changed; and these variations have but brought out the more the purpose, or expression of the original. It is so with the so-called Saint John the Baptist of the Louvre—one of the few naked figures Leonardo painted—whose delicate brown flesh and woman’s hair no one would go out into the wilderness to seek, and whose treacherous smile would have us understand something far beyond the outward gesture or circum stance. But the long, reedlike cross in the hand, which suggests Saint John the Baptist, becomes faint in a copy at the Ambrosian Library, and disappears altogether in another version, in the Palazzo Rosso at Genoa. Re turning from the latter to the original, we are no longer surprised by Saint John’s strange likeness to the Bacchus which hangs near it, and which set Theophile Gautier9 thinking of Heine’s notion of decayed gods, who, to maintain themselves, after the fall of paganism, took employment in the new religion. We recognise one of those symbolical inventions in which the ostensible subject is used, not as matter for definite pictorial realisation, but as the starting-point of a train of sentiment, subtle and vague as a piece of music. No one ever ruled over the mere subject in hand more entirely than Leonardo, or bent it more dexterously to purely artistic ends. And so it comes to pass that though he handles sacred subjects continually, he is the most profane of painters; the given person or subject, Saint John in the Desert, or the Virgin on the knees of Saint Anne, is often merely the pretext for a kind of work which carries one altogether beyond the range of its conventional associations.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">About the Last Supper, its decay and restorations, a whole literature has risen up, Goethe’s pensive sketch of its sad fortunes being perhaps the best. The death in childbirth of the Duchess Beatrice was followed in Ludovico by one of those paroxysms of religious feeling which in him were constitutional. The low, gloomy Dominican church of Saint Mary of the Graces had been the favorite oratory of Beatrice. She had spent her last days there, full of sinister presentiments; at last it had been almost necessary to remove her from it by force; and now it was here that mass was said a hundred times a day for her repose. On the damp wall of the refectory, oozing with mineral salts, Leonardo painted the Last Supper. Effective anecdotes were told about it, his retouchings and delays. They show him refusing to work except at the moment of invention, scornful of any one who supposed that art could be a work of mere industry and rule, often coming the whole length of Milan to give a single touch. He painted it, not in fresco, where all must be impromptu, but in oils, the new method which he had been one of the first to welcome, because it allowed of so many afterthoughts, so refined a working out of perfection. It turned out that on a plastered wall no process could have been less durable. Within fifty years it had fallen into decay. And now we have to turn back to Leonardo’s own studies, above all to one drawing of the central head at the Brera, which, in a union of tenderness and severity in the face lines, reminds one of the monumental work of Mino da Fiesole10, to trace it as it was.</td></tr>

Strange, after all the mystic developments of the middle age, was the effort to see the Eucharist, not as the pale Host of the altar, but as one taking leave of his friends. Five years afterwards the young Raphael, at Florence, painted it with sweet and solemn effect in the refectory of Saint Onofrio; but still with all the mystical unreality of the school of Perugino. Vasari pretends that the central head was never finished. But finished or unfinished, or owing part of its effect to a mellowing decay, the head of Jesus does but consummate the sentiment of the whole company—ghosts through which you see the wall, faint as the shadows of the leaves upon the wall on autumn afternoons.

		<td class="en">The Last Supper was finished in 1497; in 1498 the French entered Milan, and whether or not the Gascon bowmen used it as a mark for their arrows, the model of Francesco Sforza certainly did not survive. What, in that age, such work was capable of being—of what nobility, amid what racy truthfulness to fact—we may judge from the bronze statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni on horseback, modelled by Leonardo’s master, Verrocchio (he died of grief, it was said, because, the mold accidentally failing, he was unable to complete it), still standing in the piazza of Saint John and Saint Paul at Venice. Some traces of the thing may remain in certain of Leonardo’s drawings, and perhaps also, by a singular circumstance, in a far-off town of France. For Ludovico became a prisoner, and ended his days at Loches in Touraine. After many years of captivity in the dungeons below, where all seems sick with barbarous feudal memories, he was allowed at last, it is said, to breathe fresher air for awhile in one of the rooms of the great tower still shown, its walls covered with strange painted arabesques, ascribed by tradition to his hand, amused a little, in this way, through the tedious years. In those vast helmets and human faces and pieces of armor, among which, in great letters, the motto Infelix Sum is woven in and out, it is perhaps not too fanciful to see the fruit of a wistful after-dreaming over Leonardo’s sundry experiments on the armed figure of the great duke, which had occupied the two so much during the days of their good fortune at Milan.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >列奥纳多的余生基本上是在到处漂泊。在豪华的宫廷生活时期他没有攒下什么钱，回到佛罗伦萨时已很穷困。或许是生活的窘迫使他的精神保持着亢奋：接下来的4年是一个长时间全神贯注入迷创作的时期。他创作了现在保存在卢浮宫里的那些作品，那些最确定出自他之手的作品，这些作品直接从弗朗西斯一世在枫丹白露的陈列柜里送进了卢浮宫。他的一幅《圣安妮》，不是卢浮宫的《圣安妮》，而是现存于伦敦的一幅寥寥几笔的草图，一时间使一种在早期更为普遍的欣赏品位复兴，那时优秀作品仍然被认为是不可思议的。两天里各色人物怀着莫名的兴奋在放置这幅画的房间里穿梭往来，让列奥纳多有了一种契马布埃的《凯旋》的味道。但是他的作品更多地表现了佛罗伦萨当时的女性而非圣人，因为他仍生活在他热爱的考究的社会里，在佛罗伦萨的居所里他曾经见过吉内芙拉·迪·本奇和弗朗切斯科·德尔·乔康达年轻的第三任妻子丽莎。那里可能还有一点因萨沃那洛拉之死而留下的话题。最近的流言(1869年)则是说一幅裸身的蒙娜丽莎被发现，藏于过世的奥尔良的收藏品没人注意的角落里。正如我们知道他使用宗教故事里的事件，不是为了表现事件本身，也不单是作为绘画的题材，而是作为表达自己的想象的一种隐语。所以此时他为自己的思想找到一个出口，在这些疲倦女人中选择一个升华成勒达或波摩娜，升华成谦虚之神或虚荣之神，提升至象征性表达的第七重天。</td>
		<td class="en">The remaining years of Leonardo’s life are more or less years of wandering. From his brilliant life at court he had saved nothing, and he returned to Florence a poor man. Perhaps necessity kept his spirit excited: the next four years are one prolonged rapture of ecstasy of invention. He painted now the pictures of the Louvre, his most authentic works, which came there straight from the cabinet of Francis the First, at Fontainebleau. One picture of his, the Saint Anne—not the Saint Anne of the Louvre, but a simple cartoon, now in London—revived for a moment a sort of appreciation more common in an earlier time, when good pictures had still seemed miraculous. For two days a crowd of people of all qualities passed in naive excitement through the chamber where it hung, and gave Leonardo a taste of the triumph of Cimabue11. But his work was less with the saints than with the living women of Florence. For he lived still in the polished society that he loved, and in the houses of Florence, left perhaps a little subject to light thoughts by the death of Savonarola— the latest gossip (1869) is of an undraped Manna Lisa, found in some out-of-the-way corner of the late Orleans collection—he saw Ginevra di Benci, and Lisa, the young third wife of Francesco del Giocondo. As we have seen him using incidents of sacred story, not for their own sake, nor as mere subjects for pictorial realisation, but as a cryptic language for fancies all his own, so now he found a vent for his thought in taking one of these languid women, and raising her, as Leda or Pomona, as Modesty or Vanity, to the seventh heaven of symbolical expression.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">La Gioconda is, in the truest sense, Leonardo’s masterpiece, the revealing instance of his mode of thought and work. In suggestiveness, only the Melancholia of Dürer12 is comparable to it; and no crude symbolism disturbs the effect of its subdued and graceful mystery. We all know the face and hands of the figure, set in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea. Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least. (Yet for Vasari there was some further magic of crimson in the lips and cheeks, lost for us.) As often happens with works in which invention seems to reach its limit, there is an element in it given to, not invented by, the master. In that inestimable folio of drawings, once in the possession of Vasari, were certain designs by Verrocchio, faces of such impressive beauty that Leonardo in his boyhood copied them many times. It is hard not to connect with these designs of the elder, by-past master, as with its germinal principle, the unfathomable smile, always with a touch of something sinister in it, which plays over all Leonardo’s work. Besides, the picture is a portrait. From childhood we see this image defining itself on the fabric of his dreams, and but for express historical testimony, we might fancy that this was but his ideal lady, embodied and beheld at last. What was the relation ship of a living Florentine to this creature of his thought? By what strange affinities had the dream and the person grown up thus apart, and yet so closely together? Present from the first incorporeally in Leon ardo’s brain, dimly traced in the designs of Verrocchio, she is found present at last in Il Giocondo’s house. That there is much of mere portraiture in the picture is at tested by the legend that by artificial means, the presence of mimes and flute-players, that subtle expression was protracted on the face. Again, was it in four years and by renewed labor never really completed, or in four months and as by stroke of magic, that the image was projected?</td></tr>

Hers is the head upon which all “the ends of the world are come”, and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the mysticism of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants, and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern philosophy has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One other great work was left for him to do, a work all trace of which soon vanished, The Battle of the Standard, in which he had Michelangelo for his rival. The citizens of Florence, desiring to decorate the walls of the great council-chamber, had offered the work for competition, and any subject might be chosen from the Florentine wars of the fifteenth century. Michelangelo chose for his cartoon an incident of the war with Pisa, in which the Florentine soldiers, bathing in the Arno, are surprised by the sound of trumpets, and run to arms. His design has reached us only in an old engraving, which helps us less perhaps than our remembrance of the background of his Holy Family in the Uffizii to imagine in what superhuman form, such as might have beguiled the heart of an earlier world, those figures ascended out of the water. Leonardo chose an incident from the battle of Anghiari, in which two parties of soldiers fight for a standard. Like Michelangelo’s, his cartoon is lost, and has come to us only in sketches, and in a fragment of Rubens13. Through the accounts given we may discern some lust of terrible things in it, so that even the horses tore each other with their teeth. And yet one fragment of it, in a drawing of his at Florence, is far different—a waving field of lovely armour, the chased edgings running like lines of sunlight from side to side. Michelangelo was twenty-seven years old; Leonardo more than fifty; and Raphael, then nineteen years of age, visiting Florence for the first time, came and watched them as they worked.</td></tr>

No one had ever carried political indifferentism farther; it had always been his philosophy to “fly before the storm”; he is for the Sforzas, or against them, as the tide of their fortune turns.

		<td class="en">It is the mistake of much popular criticism to regard poetry, music, and painting—all the various products of art—as but translations into different languages of one and the same fixed quantity of imaginative thought, supplemented by certain technical qualities of color, in painting; of sound, in music; of rhythmical words, in poetry. In this way, the sensuous element in art, and with it al most everything in art that is essentially artistic, is made a matter of indifference; and a clear apprehension of the opposite principle—that the sensuous material of each art brings with it a special phase or quality of beauty, untranslatable into the forms of any other, an order of impressions distinct in kind—is the beginning of all true aesthetic criticism. For, as art addresses not pure sense, still less the pure intellect, but the “imaginative reason” through the senses, there are differences of kind in aesthetic beauty, corresponding to the differences in kind of the gifts of sense themselves. Each art, therefore, having its own peculiar and untranslatable sensuous charm, has its own special mode of reaching the imagination, its own special responsibilities to its material. One of the functions of aesthetic criticism is to define these limitations; to estimate the degree in which a given work of art fulfils its responsibilities to its special material; to note in a picture that true pictorial charm, which is neither a mere poetical thought or sentiment, on the one hand, nor a mere result of communicable technical skill in color or design, on the other; to define in a poem that true poetical quality, which is neither descriptive nor meditative merely, but comes of an inventive handling of rhythmical language, the element of song in the singing; to note in music the musical charm, that essential music, which presents no words, no matter of sentiment or thought, separable from the special form in which it is conveyed to us.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">To such a philosophy of the variations of the beautiful, Lessing’s2 analysis of the spheres of sculpture and poetry, in the Laocoon, was an important contribution. But a true appreciation of these things is possible only in the light of a whole system of such art-casuistries. Now painting is the art in the criticism of which this truth most needs enforcing, for it is in popular judgments on pictures that the false generalisation of all art into forms of poetry is most prevalent. To suppose that all is mere technical acquirement in delineation or touch, working through and addressing itself to the intelligence, on the one side, or a merely poetical, or what may be called literary interest, addressed also to the pure intelligence on the other:—this is the way of most spectators, and of many critics, who have never caught sight all the time of that true pictorial quality which lies between, unique pledge, as it is, of the possession of the pictorial gift, that inventive or creative handling of pure line and color, which, as almost always in Dutch painting, as often also in the works of Titian3 or Veronese4, is quite independent of anything definitely poetical in the subject it accompanies. It is the drawing—the design projected from that peculiar pictorial temperament or constitution, in which, while it may possibly be ignorant of true anatomical proportions, all things whatever, all poetry, all ideas however abstract or obscure, float up as visible scene or image: it is the coloring—that weaving of light, as of just perceptible gold threads, through the dress, the flesh, the atmosphere, in Titian’s Lace-girl, that staining of the whole fabric of the thing with a new, delightful physical quality. This drawing, then—the arabesque traced in the air by Tintoret’s5 flying figures, by Titian’s forest branches; this coloring—the magic conditions of light and hue in the atmosphere of Titian’s Lace-girl, or Rubens’s Descent from the Cross: —these essential pictorial qualities must first of all de light the sense, delight it as directly and sensuously as a fragment of Venetian glass; and through this delight alone become the vehicle of whatever poetry or science may lie beyond them in the intention of the composer. In its primary aspect, a great picture has no more definite message for us than an accidental play of sunlight and shadow for a few moments on the wall or floor: is itself, in truth, a space of such fallen light, caught as the colors are in an Eastern carpet, but refined upon, and dealt with more subtly and exquisitely than by nature itself. And this primary and essential condition fulfilled, we may trace the coming of poetry into painting, by fine gradations upwards: from Japanese fan-painting, for instance, where we get, first, only abstract color; then, just a little interfused sense of the poetry of flowers; then sometimes, perfect flower-painting; and so, onwards, until in Titian we have, as his poetry in the Ariadne, so actually a touch of true childlike humor in the diminutive, quaint figure with its silk gown, which ascends the temple stairs, in his picture of the Presentation of the Virgin, at Venice.</td></tr>

Thus, again, sculpture aspires out of the hard limitation of pure form towards color, or its equivalent; poetry also, in many ways, finding guidance from the other arts, the analogy between a Greek tragedy and a work of Greek sculpture, between a sonnet and a relief, of French poetry generally with the art of en graving, being more than mere figures of speech; and all the arts in common aspiring towards the principle of music; music being the typical, or ideally consummate art, the object of the great Anders-streben of all art, of all that is artistic, or partakes of artistic qualities.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">This abstract language becomes clear enough, if we think of actual examples. In an actual landscape we see a long, white road, lost suddenly on the hill-verge. That is the matter of one of the etchings of M. Alphonse Legros6: only, in this etching, it is informed by an in dwelling solemnity of expression, seen upon it or half-seen, within the limits of an exceptional moment, or caught from his own mood perhaps, but which he maintains as the very essence of the thing, throughout his work. Sometimes a momentary tint of stormy light may invest a homely or too familiar scene with a character which might well have been drawn from the deep places of the imagination. Then we might say that this particular effect of light, this sudden in weaving of gold thread through the texture of the haystack, and the poplars, and the grass, gives the scene artistic qualities, that it is like a picture. And such tricks of circum stance are commonest in landscape which has little salient character of its own; because, in such scenery, all the material details are so easily absorbed by that informing expression of passing light, and elevated, throughout their whole extent, to a new and delightful effect by it. And hence the superiority, for most conditions of the picturesque, of a river-side in France to a Swiss valley, because, on the French river-side, mere topography, the simple material, counts for so little, and, all being very pure, untouched, and tranquil in itself, mere light and shade have such easy work in modulating it to one dominant tone. The Venetian landscape, on the other hand, has in its material conditions much which is hard, or harshly definite; but the masters of the Venetian school have shown themselves little burdened by them. Of its Alpine background they retain certain abstracted elements only, of cool color and tranquillising line; and they use its actual details, the brown windy turrets, the straw-colored fields, the forest arabesques, but as the notes of a music which duly accompanies the presence of their men and women, presenting us with the spirit or essence only of a certain sort of landscape—a country of the pure reason or half-imaginative memory.</td></tr>

Sometimes it may find a noble and quite legitimate function in the conveyance of moral or political aspiration, as often in the poetry of Victor Hugo. In such instances it is easy enough for the understanding to distinguish between the matter and the form, however much the matter, the subject, the element which is addressed to the mere intelligence, has been penetrated by the informing, artistic spirit. But the ideal types of poetry are those in which this distinction is reduced to its minimum; so that lyrical poetry, precisely because in it we are least able to detach the matter from the form, without a deduction of some thing from that matter itself, is, at least artistically, the highest and most complete form of poetry. And the very perfection of such poetry often appears to depend, in part, on a certain suppression or vagueness of mere subject, so that the meaning reaches us through ways not distinctly traceable by the understanding, as in some of the most imaginative compositions of William Blake, and often in Shakespeare’s songs, as pre-eminently in that song of Mariana’s page in Measure for Measure, in which the kindling force and poetry of the whole play seems to pass for a moment into an actual strain of music.</td></tr>

In music, then, rather than in poetry, is to be found the true type or measure of perfected art. Therefore, although each art has its incommunicable element, its untranslatable order of impressions, its unique mode of reaching the “imaginative reason”, yet the arts may be represented as continually struggling after the law or principle of music, to a condition which music alone completely realises; and one of the chief functions of aesthetic criticism, dealing with the products of art, new or old, is to estimate the degree in which each of those products approaches, in this sense, to musical law.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The beginnings of Venetian painting link themselves to the last, stiff, half-barbaric splendors of Byzantine decoration, and are but the introduction into the crust of marble and gold on the walls of the Duomo of Murano, or of Saint Mark’s, of a little more of human expression. And throughout the course of its later development, al ways subordinate to architectural effect, the work of the Venetian school never escaped from the influence of its beginnings. Unassisted, and therefore unperplexed, by naturalism, religious mysticism, philosophical theories, it had no Giotto7, no Angelico8, no Botticelli9. Exempt from the stress of thought and sentiment, which taxed so severely the resources of the generations of Florentine artists, those earlier Venetian painters, down to Carpaccio10 and the Bellini11, seem never for a moment to have been so much as tempted to lose sight of the scope of their art in its strictness, or to forget that painting must be before all things decorative, a thing for the eye, a space of color on the wall, only more dexterously blent than the marking of its precious stone or the chance inter change of sun and shade upon it:—this, to begin and end with; whatever higher matter of thought, or poetry, or religious reverie might play its part therein, between. At last, with final mastery of all the technical secrets of his art, and with somewhat more than “a spark of the divine fire” to his share, comes Giorgione. He is the inventor of genre, of those easily movable pictures which serve neither for uses of devotion, nor of allegorical or historic teaching—little groups of real men and women, amid congruous furniture or landscape—morsels of actual life, conversation or music or play, but refined upon oridealised, till they come to seem like glimpses of life from afar. Those spaces of more cunningly blent color, obediently filling their places, hitherto, in a mere architectural scheme, Giorgione detaches from the wall. He frames them by the hands of some skilful carver, so that people may move them readily and take with them where they go, as one might a poem in manuscript, or a musical instrument, to be used, at will, as a means of self-education, stimulus or solace, coming like an animated presence, into one’s cabinet, to enrich the air as with some choice aroma, and, like persons, live with us, for a day or a lifetime. Of all art such as this, art which has played so large a part in men’s culture since that time, Giorgione is the initiator. Yet in him too that old Venetian clearness or justice, in the apprehension of the essential limitations of the pictorial art, is still undisturbed. While he interfuses his painted work with a high-strung sort of poetry, caught directly from a singularly rich and high- strung sort of life, yet in his selection of subject, or phase of subject, in the subordination of mere subject to pictorial design, to the main purpose of a picture, he is typical of that aspiration of all the arts towards music, which I have endeavored to explain,—towards the perfect identification of matter and form.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Born so near to Titian, though a little before him, that these two companion pupils of the aged Giovanni Bellini may almost be called contemporaries, Giorgione stands to Titian in something like the relationship of Sordello to Dante, in Browning’s poem.

He lives in constant labor more than sixty years after Giorgione is in his grave; and with such fruit, that hardly one of the greater towns of Europe is without some fragment of his work. But the slightly older man, with his so limited actual product (what remains to us of it seeming, when narrowly explained, to reduce itself to almost one picture, like Sordello’s one fragment of lovely verse), yet expresses, in elementary motive and principle, that spirit—itself the final acquisition of all the long endeavors of Venetian art—which Titian spreads over his whole life’s activity.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And, as we might expect, something fabulous and illusive has always mingled itself in the brilliancy of Giorgione’s fame. The exact relationship to him of many works—drawings, portraits, painted idylls—often fascinating enough, which in various collections went by his name, was from the first uncertain. Still, six or eight famous pictures at Dresden, Florence and the Louvre, were with no doubt attributed to him, and in these, if anywhere, something of the splendor of the old Venetian humanity seemed to have been preserved. But of those six or eight famous pictures it is now known that only one is certainly from Giorgione’s hand. The accomplished science of the subject has come at last, and, as in other instances, has not made the past more real for us, but assured us only that we possess less of it than we seemed to possess. Much of the work on which Giorgione’s immediate fame depended, work done for instantaneous effect, in all probability passed away almost with- in his own age, like the frescoes on the facade of thefondaco dei Tedeschi at Venice, some crimson traces of which, however, still give a strange additional touch of splendor to the scene of the Rialto. And then there is a barrier or borderland, a period about the middle of the sixteenth century, in passing through which the tradition miscarries, and the true outlines of Giorgione’s work and person are obscured. It became fashionable for wealthy lovers of art, with no critical standard of authenticity, to collect so-called works of Giorgione, and a multitude of imitations came into circulation. And now, in the “new Vasari” (Crowe and Cavalcaselle: History of Painting in North Italy.), the great traditional reputation, woven with so profuse demand on men’s admiration, has been scrutinized thread by thread; and what remains of the most vivid and stimulating of Venetian masters, a live flame, as it seemed, in those old shadowy times, has been reduced almost to a name by his most recent critics.</td></tr>

The outline of the lifted finger, the trace of the plume, the very threads of the fine linen, which fasten themselves on the memory, in the moment before they are lost altogether in that calm unearthly glow, the skill which has caught the waves of wandering sound, and fixed them for ever on the lips and hands—these are indeed the master’s own; and the criticism which, while dismissing so much hitherto believed to be Giorgione’s, has established the claims of this one picture, has left it among the most precious things in the world of art.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It is noticeable that the distinction of this Concert, its sustained evenness of perfection, alike in design, in execution, and in choice of personal type, becomes for the “new Vasari” the standard of Giorgione’s genuine work. Finding here sufficient to explain his influence, and the true seal of mastery, its authors assign to Pelle grino da San Daniele the Holy Family in the Louvre, in consideration of certain points where it comes short of this standard. Such shortcoming, however, will hardly diminish the spectator’s enjoyment of a singular charm of liquid air, with which the whole picture seems instinct, filling the eyes and lips, the very garments, of its sacred personages, with some wind-searched brightness and energy; of which fine air the blue peak, clearly de fined in the distance, is, as it were, the visible pledge. Similarly, another favorite picture in the Louvre, the subject of a delightful sonnet by a poet (Dante Gabriel Rossetti.) whose own painted work often comes to mind as one ponders over these precious things—the Fête Champêtre, is assigned to an imitator of Sebastian del Piombo; and the Tempest, in the Academy at Venice, to Paris Bordone, or perhaps to “some advanced craftsman of the sixteenth century.” From the gallery at Dresden, the Knight embracing a Lady, where the knight’s broken gauntlets seem to mark some well-known pause in a story we would willingly hear the rest of, is conceded to “a Brescian hand”, and Jacob meeting Rachel to a pupil of Palma. And then, whatever their charm, we are called on to give up the Ordeal, and the Finding of Moses with its jewel-like pools of water, perhaps to Bellini.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Nor has the criticism, which thus so freely diminishes the number of his authentic works, added anything important to the well-known outline of the life and personality of the man: only, it has fixed one or two dates, one or two circumstances, a little more exactly. Giorgione was born before the year 1477, and spent his child hood at Castelfranco, where the last crags of the Venetian Alps break down romantically, with something of parklike grace, to the plain. A natural child of the family of the Barbarelli by a peasant-girl of Vedelago, he finds his way early into the circle of notable persons—people of courtesy. He is initiated into those differences of personal type, manner, and even of dress, which are best understood there—that “distinction” of the Concert of the Pitti Palace. Not far from his home lives Cather ine of Conara, formerly Queen of Cyprus; and, up in the towers which still remain, Tuzio Costanzo, the famous condottiere—a picturesque remnant of medieval manners, amid a civilisation rapidly changing. Giorgione paints their portraits; and when Tuzio’s son, Matteo, dies in early youth, adorns in his memory a chapel in the church of Castelfranco, painting on this occasion, perhaps, the altar-piece, foremost among his authentic works, still to be seen there, with the figure of the warrior-saint, Liberale, of which the original little study in oil, with the delicately gleaming, silver-grey armour, is one of the greater treasures of the National Gallery. In that figure, as in some other knightly personages attributed to him, people have supposed the likeness of the painter’s own presumably gracious presence. Thither, at last, he is himself brought home from Venice, early dead, but celebrated. It happened, about his thirty -fourth year, that in one of those parties at which he entertained his friends with music, he met a certain lady of whom he became greatly enamoured, and “they rejoiced greatly,” says Vasari, “the one and the other, in their loves.” And two quite different legends concerning it agree in this, that it was through this lady he came by his death; Ridolfi relating that, being robbed of her by one of his pupils, he died of grief at the double treason; Vasari, that she being secretly stricken of the plague, and he making his visits to her as usual, Giorgione took the sickness from her mortally, along with her kisses, and so briefly departed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But, although the number of Giorgione’s extant works has been thus limited by recent criticism, all is not done when the real and the traditional elements in what concerns him have been discriminated; for, in what is connected with a great name, much that is not real is often very stimulating. For the aesthetic philosopher, there fore, over and above the real Giorgione and his authentic extant works, there remains the Giorgionesque also—an influence, a spirit or type in art, active in men so different as those to whom many of his supposed works are, really assignable. A veritable school, in fact, grew together out of all those fascinating works rightly or wrongly attributed to him; out of many copies from, or variations on him, by unknown or uncertain workmen, whose drawings and designs were, for various reasons, prized as his; out of the immediate impression he made upon his contemporaries, and with which he continued in men’s minds; out of many traditions of subject and treatment, which really descend from him to our own time, and by retracing which we fill out the original image. Giorgione thus becomes a sort of impersonation of Venice itself, its projected reflex or ideal, all that was intense or desirable in it crystallising about the memory of this wonderful young man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，让我最后再说明一下这个乔尔乔涅画派（如果我们可以这样称呼它的话）的一些特点。因为对我们中的大多数来说，尽管有“新瓦萨里”的种种负面批判，仍能用保存在佛罗伦萨、德累斯顿和巴黎的著名作品来标明它的身份。它为我们界定了某种艺术理想——对某一特定的艺术目的或过程的概念，不论我们在哪里发现它，不管是在威尼斯画派的作品里还是在我们自己时代的作品里，我们都可以理解为是乔尔乔涅风格。保存在皮蒂宫中的《田园合奏》，这幅确定出自乔尔乔涅之手的作品是一个典型的例子，也是一个验证此流派及其流派精神与大师之间联系的保证。</td>
		<td class="en">And now, finally, let me illustrate some of the characteristics of this School of Giorgione, as we may call it, which, for most of us, notwithstanding all that negative criticism of the “new Vasari”, will still identify itself with those famous pictures at Florence, at Dresden and Paris. A certain artistic ideal is there defined for us—the conception of a peculiar aim and procedure in art, which we may understand as the Giorgionesque, wherever we find it, whether in Venetian work generally, or in work of our own time. Of this the Concert, that undoubted work of Giorgione in the Pitti Palace, is the typical instance, and a pledge, authenticating the connexion of the school, and the spirit of the school, with the master.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我曾说过，一件艺术作品的内容或主题与其形式之间的某种相互渗透，即只有在音乐中才能完全得以实现的状态，是每种艺术形式都在永恒追求的状态。在绘画艺术中，这种理想状态的获得，这种主题和色彩构图元素的完美渗透，当然，在很大程度上依赖于主题或是主题阶段的灵活选择；而这种选择是乔尔乔涅画派的秘密之一。它是风俗画派，主要创作田园诗画，但是在创作这种绘画诗的过程中，在选择像最迅捷、最完全地适应图画形式，以便通过素描和色彩来完整表达内容等方面它练就了一种神奇的手法。因为虽然此流派的作品是诗画，却属于一种无需讲述就能展现其中故事的诗歌形式。大师在作出决定、把握时机、迅速反应方面是卓越不凡的，借此他再现了瞬间的动作—披上盔甲，头颅高贵地向后扬着—昏倒的女子—拥抱，快如亲吻，与死亡一起从垂死的嘴唇上捕捉到—镜子、光亮盔甲和平静水面的刹那联结使一个立体形象的各个角度同时展现出来，解决了绘画能否能像雕塑一样完全展现物体的令人迟疑的问题。突然的动作、思维的快速转变和一瞬即逝的表情—他捕捉到了瓦萨里评价他时所说的那种活泼的线条和鲜明的色彩。“它属于乔尔乔涅，”他这样说。现在它是戏剧性诗歌最高门类的理想的部分，给我们展现了一种深刻的、具有重大意义的活生生的瞬间：一个简单手势、一道目光、也可能是一抹微笑—短暂但却具体的瞬间—然而，一段漫长历史的所有主题、所有的趣味和效果都浓缩其中，而且似乎在一种对现在的强烈意识中承载了过去和未来。这些是乔尔乔涅画派在掌握了高超手法的同时，从古老的威尼斯市民那个狂热、喧嚣、多姿多彩的世界里选取的理想瞬间—时间流逝中精致的停顿，我们被吸引于其中，似乎在观看存在那里的所有的丰盈内涵，而它们也像是生活的完美精华或典范。</td>
		<td class="en">I have spoken of a certain interpenetration of the matter or subject of a work of art with the form of it, a condition realised absolutely only in music, as the condition to which every form of art is perpetually aspiring. In the art of painting, the attainment of this ideal condition, this perfect interpenetration of the subject with the elements of colour and design, depends, of course, in great measure, on dexterous choice of that subject, or phase of subject; and such choice is one of the secrets of Giorgione’s school. It is the school of genre, and employs itself mainly with painted idylls, but, in the production of this pictorial poetry, exercises a wonderful tact in the selecting of such matter as lends itself most readily and entirely to pictorial form, to complete expression by drawing and colour. For although its productions are painted poems, they belong to a sort of poetry which tells itself without an articulated story. The master is pre-eminent for the resolution, the case and quickness, with which he reproduces instantaneous motion—the lacing-on of armour, with the head bent back so stately—the fainting lady—the embrace, rapid as the kiss, caught with death itself from dying lips—some momentary conjunction of mirrors and polished armour and still water, by which all the sides of a solid image are exhibited at once, solving that casuistical question whether painting can present an object as completely as sculpture. The sudden act, the rapid transition of thought, the passing expression—this he arrests with that vivacity which Vasari has attributed to him, ilfuoco Giorgioneseo, as he terms it. Now it is part of the ideality of the highest sort of dramatic poetry, that it presents us with a kind of profoundly significant and animated instants, a mere gesture, a look, a smile, perhaps—some brief and wholly concrete moment—into which, however, all the motives, all the interests and effects of a long history, have condensed themselves, and which seem to absorb past and future in an intense consciousness of the present. Such ideal instants the school of Giorgione selects, with its admirable tact, from that feverish, tumultuously coloured world of the old citizens of Venice—exquisite pauses in time, in which, arrested thus, we seem to be spectators of all the fulness of existence, and which are like some consummate extract or quintessence of life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如我所言，所有这样的艺术都真正渴望达到音乐的法则或状态。而在乔尔乔涅画派中，音乐自身的完美时刻、对音乐的创作或聆听、歌曲或它的伴奏本身就和主题一样突出。威尼斯那种寂静的背景给现代参观者留下如此深刻的印象，意大利音乐的世界就是在这样的背景下形成的。在主题的选择上，与所有其他方面的选择一样，皮蒂宫的《田园合奏》是乔尔乔涅融入自身影响之一切的典型，他本人就是一个出色的音乐家。在各式各样收藏中的素描或已完成的作品里我们可以发现许多复杂的变体——人沉迷于音乐中；人们钓鱼的水池边奏出音乐，或者是音乐混杂着井里水罐的声响，或是河流对面的声音，亦或羊群的叫声；乐器的调音；就像柏拉图在《理想国》中的一段精彩描写那样，人们带着专注的表情，好像在聆听，以捕捉乐声里最短的间隔、空气中最小的波动；在无弦乐器上于思索中感受音乐，不断锻炼耳朵和手指，以此来满足对甜美声音的渴望；黎明中对乐器的刹那一触，如同一个人在邂逅的人群中行走的时候经过某个陌生的房间。</td>
		<td class="en">It is to the law or condition of music, as I said, that all art like this is really aspiring; and, in the school of Giorgione, the perfect moments of music itself, the making or hearing of music, song or its accompaniment, are themselves prominent as subjects. On that background of the silence of Venice, so impressive to the modern visitor, the world of Italian music was then forming. In choice of subject, as in all besides, the Concert of the Pitti Palace is typical of everything that Giorgione, him self an admirable musician, touched with his influence. In sketch or finished picture, in various collections, we may follow it through many intricate variations—men fainting at music; music at the pool-side while people fish, or mingled with the sound of the pitcher in the well, or heard across running water, or among the flocks; the tuning of instruments; people with intent faces, as if listening, like those described by Plato in an ingenious passage of the Republic, to detect the smallest interval of musical sound, the smallest undulation in the air, or feeling for music in thought on a stringless instrument, ear and finger refining themselves infinitely, in the appetite for sweet sound; a momentary touch of an instrument in the twilight, as one passes through some unfamiliar room, in a chance company.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么在这些乔尔乔涅画派最喜欢的瞬间，即音乐或我们生活中揉合着音乐的间隙中，生活本身被构想成一种聆听——聆听音乐，聆听朗读班戴洛小说的声音，聆听水声，聆听时间的飞逝。这些时刻其实常常是我们玩乐的时刻，我们因自己的时光里看起来最不重要的部分受到意外的眷顾而惊喜。不只是因为很多情况下，人们在玩乐中真正投入了自己最佳的精力，而且因为在这些时候，我们卑屈的压力和平时的注意力放松了，外部事物中更愉快的力量得以自由通过，随我们同行。因此，乔尔乔涅画派常从音乐过渡到进行和音乐类似的玩乐，举行那种假面舞会，人们在其中一本正经，但是在现实生活中则游戏其中，就像小孩子“过家家”，舞会参加者穿戴起奇异的老式意大利服装，色彩丰富，或者装饰着古怪而漂亮的刺绣或皮毛，而这位大师则是如此奇异的设计师，在手腕或喉咙处一尘不染的白色亚麻布之上，他如此巧妙地创作着。</td>
		<td class="en">In these then, the favourite incidents of Giorgione’s school, music or the musical intervals in our existence, life itself is conceived as a sort of listening—listening to music, to the reading of Bandello’s novels, to the sound of water, to time as it flies. Often such moments are really our moments of play, and we are surprised at the unexpected blessedness of what may seem our least important part of time; not merely because play is in many instances that to which people really apply their own best powers, but also because at such times, the stress of our servile, everyday attentiveness being relaxed, the happier powers in things without are permitted free passage, and have their way with us. And so, from music, the school of Giorgione passes often to the play which is like music; to those masques in which men avowedly do but play at real life, like children “dressing up”, disguised in the strange old Italian dresses, particoloured, or fantastic with embroidery and furs, of which the master was so curious a designer, and which, above all the spotless white linen at wrist and throat, he painted so dexterously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是当人们满足于这块干渴的土地时，水流也就在不远处了。在乔尔乔涅画派里水的表现——水井，或是用大理石镶嵌边缘的水池，汲水或是倒水，就像《乡间聚会》里一个手上带着珠宝的女人从水壶里倒水一样：她在倾听，可能是听水落下的清冷、混着笛声的声音——这些和音乐本身一样具有特色，而且几乎一样具有启发性。并且风光似乎也乐于承受这水流：一片被水冲刷过的清新风景里，新降的雨水穿越空气汇入长满草的水沟里。另外，在乔尔乔涅画派中，空气就像正在呼吸它的人们一样鲜活，并且基本上像是在天堂里，所有杂质都被燃烧干净，没有污点也没有任何漂浮的微粒，只有它本身适合的成分才被准许存在于其中。</td>
		<td class="en">But when people are happy in this thirsty land water will not be far off; and in the school of Giorgione, the presence of water—the well, or marble-rimmed pool, the drawing or pouring of water, as the woman pours it from a pitcher with her jewelled hand in the Fête Champêtre, listening, perhaps, to the cool sound as it falls, blent with the music of the pipes—is as characteristic, and almost as suggestive, as that of music itself. And the landscape feels and is glad of it also—a landscape full of clearness, of the effects of water, of fresh rain newly passed through the air, and collected into the grassy channels. The air, moreover, in the school of Giorgione, seems as vivid as the people who breathe it, and literally empyrean, all impurities being burnt out of it, and no taint, no floating particle of anything but its own proper elements allowed to subsist within it.</td></tr>

Only, in Italy all natural things are as it were woven through and through the gold thread, even the cypress revealing it among the folds of its blackness. And it is with gold dust, or gold thread, that these Venetian painters seem to work, spinning its fine filaments, through the solemn human flesh, away into the white plastered walls of the thatched huts. The harsher details of the mountains re cede to a harmonious distance, the one peak of rich blue above the horizon remaining but as the sensible warrant of that due coolness which is all we need ask here of the Alps, with their dark rains and streams. Yet what real, airy space, as the eye passes from level to level, through the long-drawn valley in which Jacob embraces Rachel among the flocks! Nowhere is there a truer instance of that balance, that modulated unison of landscape and persons—of the human image and its accessories—already noticed as characteristic of the Venetian school, so that, in it, neither personage nor scenery is ever a mere pretext for the other.</td></tr>

In this, Giorgione is but an illustration of a valuable general caution we may abide by in all criticism. As regards Giorgione himself, we have indeed to take note of all those negotiations and exceptions, by which, at first sight, a “new Vasari” seems merely to have confused our apprehension of a delightful object, to have explained away in our inheritance from past time what seemed of high value there. Yet it is not with a full understanding even of those exceptions that one can leave off just at this point. Properly qualified, such exceptions are but a salt of genuineness in our knowledge; and beyond all those strictly ascertained facts, we must take note of that indirect influence by which one like Giorgione, for instance, enlarges his permanent efficacy and really makes himself felt in our culture.

		<td class="en">IN the middle of the sixteenth century, when the spirit of the Renaissance was everywhere, and people had begun to look back with distaste on the works of the middle age, the old Gothic manner had still one chance more, in borrowing something from the rival which was about to supplant it. In this way there was produced, chiefly in France, a new and peculiar phase of taste with qualities and a charm of its own, blending the somewhat attenuated grace of Italian ornament with the general outlines of Northern design. It created the Château de Gaillon, as you may still see it in the delicate engravings of Isräel Silvestre—a Gothic donjon veiled faintly by a surface of dainty Italian traceries—Chenon ceaux, Blois, Chambord, and the church of Brou. In painting, there came from Italy workmen like Maître Roux and the masters of the school of Fontainebleau, to, have their later Italian voluptuousness attempered by the naïve and silvery qualities of the native style; and it was characteristic of these painters that they were most successful in painting on glass, an art so essentially medieval. Taking it up where the middle age had left it, they found their whole work among the last subtleties of colour and line; and keeping within the true limits of their material, they got quite a new order of effect from it, and felt their way to refinements on colour never dreamed of by those older workmen, the glass-painters of Chartres or Le Mans. What is called the Renaissance in France is thus not so much the introduction of a wholly new taste ready-made from Italy, but rather the finest and subtlest phase of the middle age itself, its last fleeting splendour and temperate Saint Martin’s summer. In poetry, the Gothic spirit in France had produced a thousand songs; so in the Renaissance, French poetry, too, did but borrow something to blend with a native growth, and the poems of Ronsard, with their ingenuity, their delicately figured surfaces, their slightness, their fanciful combinations of rhyme, are the correlative of the traceries of the house of Jacques Coeur at Bourges, or the Maison de Justice at Rouen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >的确，在法国本土的风格中有一些东西跟意大利的那份灵气很相似。法国作品的特色一直是某种精细，一种手法的出奇讲究，一种非凡的明确表现。例如，在弗朗索瓦·克卢埃—或者更准确的说是克卢埃家族，因为他们整个家庭中绘画传统悠久—那些拒绝受到意大利影响的画家，其作品中有一种色彩的清晰和表达的明确，这把他们和他们的佛兰德斯邻居—海姆林或者凡·爱克家族明确区分开来。这种精细在法国古诗歌中也一样突出。一种轻盈无形的精致，一种简单的优雅—一种非凡的明确表现—这些基本特征在维永诗歌和《布列塔尼的安妮的时代》中同样显著。它们也是上百件法国哥特式雕塑作品和窗饰的特点。同样地，在古老的哥特式教堂和与它对应的古老哥特式武功歌中，这种沉重粗笨的样式好像经历了一段时间，达到了令人更加愉悦的状态，或者说穿过一层更高雅的空气变得优美儒雅，像是伏尔戈特花岗岩教堂上的石刻蕨类，或是《罗兰之歌》中描绘特平大主教的僧侣的优美的双手的线条，尽管两者脚下的根基是纯粹的哥特式的力量，或者说沉重。（马克·帕蒂森夫人在其具有很高品位和学识的作品《法国艺术的复兴》中，对这个主题的纯艺术方面进行了阐述。—作者注）</td>
		<td class="en">There was indeed something in the native French taste naturally akin to that Italian finesse. The characteristic of French work had always been a certain nicety, a remarkable daintiness of hand, une netteté remarquable d’exécution. In the paintings of François Clouet, for example, or rather of the Clouets—for there was a whole family of them—painters remarkable for their resistance to Italian influences, there is a silveriness of colour and a clearness of expression which distinguish them very definitely from their Flemish neighbours, Hemling or the Van Eycks. And this nicety is not less characteristic of old French poetry. A light, aerial delicacy, a simple elegance—une netteté remarquable d’exécution: these are essential characteristics alike of Villon’s1 poetry, and of the Hours of Anne of Brittany. They are characteristic, too, of a hundred French Gothic carvings and traceries. Alike in the old Gothic cathedrals, and in their counterpart, the old Gothic chansons de geste2, the rough and ponderous mass becomes as if by passing for a moment into happier conditions, or through a more gracious stratum of air, graceful and refined, like the carved ferneries on the granite church at Folgoat, or the lines which describe the fair priestly hands of Archbishop Turpin, in the song of Roland; although below both alike there is a fund of mere Gothic strength, or heaviness.

		<td class="en">Now, Villon’s songs and Clouet’s painting are like these. It is the higher touch making itself, felt here and there, betraying itself, like nobler blood in a lower stock, by a fine line or gesture or expression, the turn of a wrist, the tapering of a finger. In Ronsard’s time that rougher element seemed likely to predominate. No one can turn over the pages of Rabelais without feeling how much need there was of softening, of castigation. To effect this softening is the object of the revolution in poetry which is connected with Ronsard’s name. Casting about for the means of thus refining upon and saving the character of French literature, he accepted that influx of Renaissance taste, which, leaving the buildings, the language, the art, the poetry of France, at bottom, what they were, old French Gothic still, gilds their surfaces with a strange, delightful, foreign aspect passing over all that Northern land, in itself neither deeper nor more permanent than a chance effect of light. He reinforces, he doubles the French daintiness by Italian finesse. Thereupon, nearly all the force and all the seriousness of French work disappear; only the elegance, the äerial touch, the perfect manner remain.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >歌德在艺术批评方面的零散作品中有几页谈到了温克尔曼那不可思议的深刻丰富的个性。他谈到这个令他事业成功、但从未谋面的老师，就像谈及一种抽象的文化类型：完满、宁静、早已回归到理想的境地，但也保留了从充满激情的知性生活的事件中汲取的色彩。他将温克尔曼与一些具备永不枯竭的联想性的艺术品划分一类，评论界可以不断从中获得新的收获。黑格尔在关于《艺术哲学》的演讲中评价前人的成果，也曾对温克尔曼的作品做出不俗的评价：“温克尔曼透过对古代完美作品的思考，获得了一种灵感，通过这种灵感他为艺术研究找到了一种新的感知方式。他应该被归入那些在艺术领域里，了解如何为人类精神创造一种新器官的大师中。”找到新的感知方式，创造新的器官是任何批判成果所能获得的最高赞誉。那么，询问是什么样的人创制了这种新器官就是很有趣的了。又是在什么样的条件下取得了这样的成果呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Goethe’s fragments of art-criticism contain a few pages of strange pregnancy on the character of Winckelmann. He speaks of the teacher who had made his career possible, but whom he had never seen, as of an abstract type of culture, consummate, tranquil, withdrawn already into the region of ideals, yet retaining colour from the incidents of a passionate intellectual life. He classes him with certain works of art, possessing an inexhaustible gift of suggestion, to which criticism may return again and again with renewed freshness. Hegel, in his lectures on the Philosophy of Art, estimating the work of his predecessors, has also passed a remarkable judgment on Winckelmann’s writings:—“Winckelmann, by contemplation of the ideal works of the ancients, received a sort of inspiration, through which he opened a new sense for the study of art. He is to be regarded as one of those who, in the sphere of art, have known how to initiate a new organ for the human spirit.” That it has given a new sense, that it has laid open a new organ, is the highest that can be said of any critical effort. It is interesting, then, to ask what kind of man it was who thus laid open a new organ. Under what conditions was that effected?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰·约阿希姆·温克尔曼1717年出生于勃兰登堡的施滕达尔。他是一个潦倒商贩的儿子，童年时代经历了很多磨难，那段记忆成了他断断续续感到沮丧的一个原因。1763年他精神完全放松地欣赏着罗马的美好景色时，写道：“在这里，一个人是会乐而忘蜀的，但这正是上帝亏欠我的，我年幼时经历了太多的苦难。”温克尔曼命中注定要承担宣扬和阐释希腊精神的魅力的重担，在18世纪上半叶枯燥乏味的德国知识界，他首先扮演了一个备受煎熬的学徒角色。之后，他走进古代遗产快乐的阳光里，获得的几乎是一种肉体上的兴奋感。我们知道他小时候在一所德国学校的灰暗的角落里如饥似渴地读着几本黯淡发黄的书。这个学校的校长失明后，温克尔曼做了他的私人助手。这位老人本想让他学习神学。温克尔曼因此可以自由进出校长图书馆，但他却决定去熟悉那些希腊经典。希罗多德和荷马以他们“元音化”的希腊文赢得了他最大的热情；他整晚整晚地疯狂阅读，开始做起了自己的纷扰的奥德赛之梦。“他觉得自己，”斯塔尔夫人说，“不可遏抑地被南方吸引。即便是现在，依旧时常可以在德国人的想象中，寻觅到促使北部的人们迁移至南方国度的那种对阳光的热爱和对北方的厌倦的痕迹。一片晴朗天空催生的情感不弱于一个人对祖国的爱。”</td>
		<td class="en">Johann Joachim Winckelmann was born at Stendal in Brandenburg, in the year 1717. The child of a poor tradesman, he passed through many struggles in early youth, the memory of which ever remained in him as a fitful cause of dejection. In 1763, in the full emancipation of his spirit, looking over the beautiful Roman prospect, he writes—“One gets spoiled here; but God owed me this; in my youth I suffered too much.” Destined to assert and interpret the charm of the Hellenic spirit, he served first a painful apprenticeship in the tarnished intellectual world of Germany in the earlier half of the eighteenth century. Passing out of that into the happy light of the antique, he had a sense of exhilaration almost physical. We find him as a child in the dusky precincts of a German school, hungrily feeding on a few colourless books. The master of this school grows blind; Winckelmann becomes his famulus. The old man would have had him study theology. Winckelmann, free of the master’s library, chooses rather to become familiar with the Greek classics. Herodotus1 and Homer win, with their vowelled Greek, his warmest enthusiasm; whole nights of fever are devoted to them; disturbing dreams of an Odyssey of his own come to him. “He felt in himself,” says Madame de Staël2, “an ardent attraction towards the south. In Ger man imaginations even now traces are often to be found of that love of the sun, that weariness of the North(cette fatigue du nord), which carried the northern peoples away into the countries of the South. A fine sky brings to birth sentiments not unlike the love of one’s Fatherland.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对我们多数人而言，那个有着鲜明轮廓和完美自我表达的古代世界，尽管我们已尝试用各种方法进行探索，它还是模糊遥远的。对温克尔曼来说，除了理想外，古代世界其他方面都是严格受局限的，为他阴暗的贫穷建造了“一所非手工制作的房子”，它很早就比现实还要真实了。到其他国家游历的美妙想法总是时不时地出现在他脑中，比如到埃及和法国，里面似乎总有一种向往找回失去东西的感觉，而不是发现任何新事物的渴望。歌德曾经提到，在渴望真正了解古物的过程中，他是如何对斯特拉斯堡附近地区存有的一些微不足道的古物残余碎片产生了兴趣。所以我们听说温克尔曼在勃兰登堡丑陋的沙丘上像孩子一样游荡收集古物也就不足为奇了。这个和温克尔曼的一致之处，歌德是乐意提及的。</td>
		<td class="en">To most of us, after all our steps towards it, the antique world, in spite of its intense outlines, its own perfect self-expression, still remains faint and remote. To him, closely limited except on the side of the ideal, building for his dark poverty “a house not made with hands,” it early came to seem more real than the present. In the fantastic plans of foreign travel continually passing through his mind, to Egypt, for instance, and to France, there seems always to be rather a wistful sense of something lost to be regained, than the desire of discovering anything new. Goethe has told us how, in his eagerness actually to handle the antique, he became interested in the insignificant vestiges of it which the neighbourhood of Strasburg afforded. So we hear of Winckelmann’s boyish antiquarian wanderings among the ugly Brandenburg sandhills. Such a conformity between himself and Winckelmann, Goethe would have gladly noted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >21岁时温克尔曼如朋友所愿进入哈雷大学学习神学；但是他却饶有兴致地翻译起了希罗多德的著作。德国学校和大学里学习希腊文的环境已经不如从前，哈雷大学里没有一个教授能满足他热切的求知欲。谈及自己的专业教育他总是语带嘲讽，宣称自始至终都是自己教自己。他的导师们没有发觉他们的手中有一种新的文化的源头。流浪不定变化无常的人！—他的一个老师曾经这样学究地形容这个后来去了罗马的朝圣者，不知道他的嘲讽缘何而起。倘若专业教育向他灌输的只有对席勒的愤怒，没人应该感到惊讶。因为席勒和他一样，都是本质上的精神冒险家。但是温克尔曼这个理性传统的信仰者，仅仅产生挣脱老学究们的禁锢的企图，这足以令我们吃惊了。</td>
		<td class="en">At twenty-one he enters the University of Halle, to study theology, as his friends desire; instead, he becomes the enthusiastic translator of Herodotus. The condition of Greek learning in German schools and universities had fallen, and there were no professors at Halle who could satisfy his sharp, intellectual craving. Of his professional education he always speaks with scorn, claiming to have been his own teacher from first to last. His appointed teachers did not perceive that a new source of culture was within their hands. Homo vagus et inconstans!—one of them pedantically reports of the future pilgrim to Rome, unaware on which side his irony was whetted. When professional education confers nothing but irritation on a Schiller, no one ought to be surprised; for Schiller, and such as he, are primarily spiritual adventurers. But that Winckelmann, the votary of the gravest of intellectual traditions, should get nothing but an attempt at suppression from the professional guardians of learning, is what may well surprise us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1743年温克尔曼成为塞豪森一个学校的校长。这是人生中最让他厌倦的一段。尽管和学生相处得很成功，这好像证实了他天性中简单而原始的部分，但他觉得教学工作很压抑。尽管从事着这个工作，他写到，自己仍怀有对获得美的知识的强烈渴望。他只得把睡眠时间缩减到4个小时，以挤出阅读的时间。同时，温克尔曼在修养方面向前迈了一步。他从那些不强烈的兴趣中抽身出来，从而节省了不少精力。他放弃了曾经大量阅读过的数学和法律，只学习艺术文献。所有进入他生命的东西都和他自己最热爱的事物有关。此时他领略到了伏尔泰的魅力。伏尔泰属于那种比较浅薄、做作的古典传统，后来温克尔曼最终用真正的古代遗产清晰、永恒的外部框架把这种传统替代了。但是事实证明伏尔泰这种天赋的权威性甚至会吸引和胜过那些天生来替代它的东西。伏尔泰对温克尔曼的影响从未被抹去，它使他思考法国文学，这和他对德国文学作品的轻蔑形成对比。德国文学，像我们所知的那样，在歌德那里得到转型发展，温克尔曼是其中一位发起者。但是当时的德国没有呈现出任何迹象，让他能够预见《伊菲革涅亚》，以及一种有效的古典传统在德国文学中的形成。</td>
		<td class="en">In 1743 he became master of a school at Seehausen. This was the most wearisome period of his life. Not withstanding a success in dealing with children, which seems to testify to something simple and primeval in his nature, he found the work of teaching very depressing. Engaged in this work, he writes that he still has within him a longing desire to attain to the knowledge of beauty—sehnlich wünschte zur Kenntniss des Schönen zu gelangen. He had to shorten his nights, sleeping only four hours, to gain time for reading. And here Winckelmann made a step forward in culture. He multiplied his intellectual force by detaching from it all flaccid interests. He renounced mathematics and law, in which his reading had been considerable—all but the literature of the arts. Nothing was to enter into his life unpenetrated by its central enthusiasm. At this time he undergoes the charm of Voltaire. Voltaire belongs to that flimsier, more artificial, classical tradition, which Winckelmann was one day to supplant, by the clearring, the eternal outline, of the genuine antique. But it proves the authority of such a gift as Voltaire’s that it allures and wins even those born to supplant it. Voltaire’s impression on Winckelmann was never effaced; and it gave him a consideration for French literature which contrasts with his contempt for the literary products of Germany. German literature transformed, siderealised, as we see it in Goethe, reckons Wincke1mann among its initiators. But Germany at that time presented nothing in which he could have anticipated Iphigenie3, and the formation of an effective classical tradition in German literature.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这种纯粹的文学的影响下，温克尔曼反对克里斯蒂安·沃尔弗和那些哲学家。歌德在谈到这种反对时，暗示他自己曾受伊曼纽尔·康德的影响。歌德告诉我们，康德对他的修养产生了影响，这种影响他无法毫无损失地拒之门外，它存在于具体事物的严格限制中。但他还说，对温克尔曼这种天生的古物研究者来说，能够不断地接触古代艺术品，并且熟悉其永恒的轮廓，如批判哲学一样有效地保持了这种限制。然而柏拉图由于常常挽救了温克尔曼弥补性的文学样式，所以不在他反对的哲学家之列。这个现代学生常常在那个看上去超越了柏拉图，不再属于异教世界的、基于精神生活概念的区域与他相遇。但是柏拉图显现给温克尔曼的这种充满吸引力的元素完全是希腊的，和基督教世界背道而驰，它通过《吕西斯》里那群聪明的年轻人展现出来，他们还没有被任何精神疾病感染，并发现所有在人类外形方面的努力的终结，而美好人类生活的骚动和运作都在继续。</td>
		<td class="en">Under this purely literary influence, Winckelmann protests against Christian Wolff and the philosophers. Goethe, in speaking of this protest, alludes to his own obligations to Emmanuel Kant. Kant’s influence over the culture of Goethe, which he tells us could not have been resisted by him without loss, consisted in a severe limitation to the concrete. But he adds, that in born antiquaries, like Winckelmann, a constant handling of the antique, with its eternal outline, maintains that limitation as effectually as a critical philosophy. Plato, however, saved so often for his redeeming literary manner, is excepted from Winckelmann’s proscription of the philosophers. The modern student most often meets Plato on that side which seems to pass beyond Plato into a world no longer pagan, based upon the conception of a spiritual life. But the element of affinity which he presents to Winckelmann is that which is wholly Greek, and alien from the Christian world, represented by that group of brilliant youths in the Lysis, still uninfected by any spiritual sickness, finding the end of all endeavour in the aspects of the human form, the continual stir and motion of a comely human life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在柏拉图对话集中发现的新兴趣让他更加渴望游历那些有着古典传统的国家。“这是我的不幸，”他写道，“我没有出生在伟大的国家，在那里本可以让我得到滋养，让我跟随自己的本能，塑造自我。”参观罗马的行程可能已经计划妥当，他在默默为此做着准备。比瑙伯爵，这位当时一部知名的历史作品的作家在诺藤尼茨筹建了一个颇有价值的图书馆，现今它是德累斯顿图书馆的一部分。1748年，温克尔曼用蹩脚的法语写信给比瑙伯爵，他说自己因比瑙对穷困文人的恩惠而获得勇气。他只想投身研究，从未允许自己沉迷于教会带给他的美好前程里。他暗示了自己此时不明确的地位，“在一个形而上学的时代里，人性的文学遭到践踏。目前，”他继续说，“希腊文学的重要性被忽略，而我一直全身投入于此并尽可能深入，而现在好书是如此稀缺而昂贵。”最后，他希望在比瑙的图书馆里获得一个小职位。“可能在将来，如果我能以某种方式摆脱默默无闻的境况，并能在首府找到维持生计的办法，我会成为一个对公众更有用的人。”</td>
		<td class="en">This new-found interest in Plato’s dialogues could not fail to increase his desire to visit the countries of the classical tradition. “It is my misfortune,” he writes, “that I was not born to great place, wherein I might have had cultivation, and the opportunity of following my instinct and forming myself.” A visit to Rome probably was already designed, and he silently preparing for it. Count Bünau, the author of a historical work then of note, had collected at Nöthenitz a valuable library, now part of the library of Dresden. In 1748 Winckelmann wrote to Bünau in halting French:—He is emboldened, he says, by Bünau’s indulgence for needy men of letters. He desires only to devote himself to study, having never allowed himself to be dazzled by favourable prospects in the Church. He hints at his doubtful position “in a metaphysical age, by which humane literature as trampled under foot. At present,” he goes on, “little value is set on Greek literature, to which I have devoted myself so far as I could penetrate, when good books are so scarce and expensive.” Finally, he desires a place in some corner of Bünau’s library. “Perhaps, at some future time, I shall become more useful to the public, if, drawn from obscurity in whatever way, I can find means to maintain myself in the capital.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们知道很快温克尔曼就在位于诺藤尼茨的图书馆里工作了。从那时起他多次去德累斯顿参观那里收藏的古物，和许多艺术家熟悉起来，其中最重要的是厄泽尔这个歌德未来的朋友和老师。厄泽尔兼具高雅的修养和艺术的实用知识，适合教导温克尔曼提高修养。现在一个新的和希腊生活沟通的渠道向他敞开了。到目前为止他掌握的只是希腊诗歌的文字，他确实因这些诗歌而激动振奋，然而还会在言辞之外揣测到一些未被表达的感官生活的搏动。突然之间，他和那种仍然在雕塑艺术的遗迹中炽热存在着的生活有了接触。我们的文化中充满了古典精神，所以我们几乎无法想象在文艺复兴时代，身处一个僵化的世界中，当被埋藏的古代艺术火种从地下升起时人类心灵受到了多深的震动。温克尔曼在此为我们重现了文艺复兴的早期情感。一霎那间，想象力感觉自己获得了自由。它好像在说，当我们能够领会时，这种感性和理性的生活是多么地简单而直接啊！这确实就是，我们一直追寻的更为自由的生活模式，它一直就离我们如此之近。我们一直通过神秘的热情和僧侣式的幻想来达成这个目标的努力是多么荒谬和迂回曲折，它们是如何亵渎了肉体，又是怎样无助于我们的解放啊！赫耳弥俄涅不再是面无表情的样子，生活中丢失的部分也得以自我恢复。然后在这里，在具体实现的成果中，我们发现温克尔曼与生俱来的逃离抽象理论，走向直觉，走向实际运用视觉和触觉的倾向。莱辛在《拉奥孔》中把诗歌和雕塑的关系完整地理论化，哲学可能会给出理论上的原因，告诉我们为什么是雕塑，而非诗歌才能最真实准确地表达希腊的理想。温克尔曼用一种轻松简单的聪敏具体地解决了这个问题。这就是歌德所说的他“对希腊艺术的认识”。</td>
		<td class="en">Soon afterwards we find Winckelmann in the library at Nöthenitz. Thence he made many visits to the collection of antiquities at Dresden. He became acquainted with many artists, above all with Oeser, Goethe’s future friend and master, who, uniting a high culture with the practical knowledge of art, was fitted to minister to Winckelmann’s culture. And now a new channel of communion with the Greek life was opened for him. Hitherto he had handled the words only of Greek poetry, stirred indeed and roused by them, yet divining beyond the words some unexpressed pulsation of sensuous life. Suddenly he is in contact with that life, still fervent in the relics of plastic art. Filled as our culture is with the classical spirit, we can hardly imagine how deeply the human mind was moved, when, at the Renaissance, in the midst of a frozen world, the buried f ire of ancient art rose up from under the soil. Winckelmann here reproduces for us the earlier sentiment of the Renaissance. On a sudden the imagination feels itself free. How facile and direct, it seems to say, is this life of the senses and the understanding, when once we have apprehended it! Here, surely, is that more liberal mode of life we have been seeking so long, so near to us all the while. How mistaken and roundabout have been our efforts to reach it by mystic passion, and monastic reverie; how they have def lowered the flesh; how little have they really emancipated us! Hermione4 melts from her stony posture, and the lost proportions of life right themselves. Here, then, in vivid realisation we see the native tendency of Winckelmann to escape from abstract theory to intuition, to the exercise of sight and touch. Lessing, in the Laocoon, has theorised finely on the relation of poetry to sculpture; and philosophy may give us theoretical reasons why not poetry but sculpture should be the most sincere and exact expression of the Greek ideal. By a happy, unperplexed dexterity, Winckelmann solves the question in the concrete. It is what Goethe calls his Gewahrwerden der griechischen Kunst, his finding of Greek art.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >透过歌德丰富多样的修养总是可以察觉出温克尔曼的影响，这种影响犹如一股清晰的古典动机的潜流，强烈并且具有调节性。“从他身上学不到什么，”他对爱克曼说，“但是他可以让人有巨大的改变。”如果我们问这种影响的秘密是什么，歌德自己会告诉我们：它是完整、自我统一和理性的融合。而这些词语描述歌德广博的修养如此恰当，似乎很难用来形容温克尔曼狭窄而专注的兴趣。毫无疑问，温克尔曼的完美是一种有限的完美：他对自己生活中一个兴趣的狂热培养和歌德多方面的能量形成了对照。但是影响歌德、指导他并对他的修养有所助益的，正是这种特定力量的完整性，是其实实在在的样式。这种力量的发展是温克尔曼唯一的兴趣，其他一切都不能干扰它。其他实际或知识方面的兴趣，那些小天分和不太重要的目标是很多人本性中无用的部分，消耗着人们的活力。温克尔曼从这些兴趣中脱身，将其抛掉。他年轻时一直以来的渴望不是模糊和空想的：他知道自己想要的是什么，他的意愿是什么。在它严格的界限里他的热情像熔岩一样燃烧。“你知道，”拉瓦特尔在谈及温克尔曼的面容时说道，“我认为热忱和冷漠绝不可能在一种性格中融合。如果说，曾经有过这样融合的惊人例子，那就是在我们眼前的这张面孔里。”“童年时地位卑微，”歌德说，“少年时没有得到足够的教导，刚成年后断断续续、精力不够集中地学习，还有管理学校的负担！30岁之前从未得到过命运眷顾：但是一旦获得了足够的自由条件，他就完美、完全地呈现，达到了古代意义上的完满。”</td>
		<td class="en">Through the tumultuous richness of Goethe’s culture, the influence of Winckelmann is always discernible, as the strong, regulative under- current of a clear, antique motive. “One learns nothing from him,” he says to Eckermann5, “but one becomes something.” If we ask what the secret of this influence was, Goethe himself will tell us—wholeness, unity with one’s self, intellectual integrity. And yet these expressions, because they fit Goethe, with his universal culture, so well, seem hardly to describe the narrow, exclusive interest of Wincke1mann. Doubtless Winckelmann’s perfection is a narrow perfection: his feverish nursing of the one motive of his life is a contrast to Goethe’s various energy. But what affected Goethe, what instructed him and ministered to his culture, was the integrity, the truth to its type, of the given force. The development of this force was the single interest of Winckelmann, unembarrassed by any thing else in him. Other interests, practical or intellectual, those slighter talents and motives not supreme, which in most men are the waste part of nature, and drain away their vitality, he plucked out and cast from him. The protracted longing of his youth is not a vague, romantic longing: he knows what he longs for, what he wills. Within its severe limits his enthusiasm burns like lava. “You know,” says Lavater6, speaking of Winckelmann’s countenance, “that I consider ardor and indifference by no means incompatible in the same character. If ever there was a striking instance of that union, it is in the countenance before us.” “A lowly childhood,” says Goethe, “insufficient instruction in youth, broken, distracted studies in early manhood, the burden of school-keeping! He was thirty years old before he enjoyed a single favor of fortune: but so soon as he had attained to an adequate condition of freedom, he appears before us consummate and entire, complete in the ancient sense.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是当他的头发渐渐斑白，他却还没有到达南部。撒克逊宫廷已经皈依罗马天主教，想要在德累斯顿得势就要成为罗马教神职人员。可能温克尔曼曾经也考虑过在罗马教庭内谋一份职业。他曾经想过假称改变自己信仰，一家修道院一家修道院地乞讨到罗马。1751年，罗马教皇使节阿尔基诺和其他人一起访问了诺藤尼茨。他说罗马是适合温克尔曼发挥才艺的舞台，并给了他在教皇图书馆里谋得一个职位的希望。红衣主教帕西奥内很欣赏温克尔曼优美的希腊文作品，如果温克尔曼愿意改信天主教的话，主教会乐意资助他。温克尔曼接受了他的资助，去拜访了在德累斯顿的教皇使节。虽然对“立誓信教”这个字眼感到不安，也并非没有内心的挣扎，但他还是在1754年7月11日加入了罗马教会。</td>
		<td class="en">But his hair is turning grey, and he has not yet reached the south. The Saxon court had become Roman Catholic, and the way to favour at Dresden was through Roman ecclesiastics. Probably the thought of a profession of the papal religion was not new to Winckelmann. At one time he had thought of begging his way to Rome, from cloister to cloister, under the pretence of a disposition to change his faith. In 1751, the papal nuncio, Archinto, was one of the visitors at Nöthenitz. He suggested Rome as the fitting stage for Winckelmann’s accomplishments and held out the hope of a place in the Pope’s library. Cardinal Passionei, charmed with Winckelmann’s beautiful Greek writing, was ready to play the part of Maecenas, if the indispensable change were made. Winckelmann accepted the bribe, and visited the nuncio at Dresden. Unquiet still at the word “profession,” not without a struggle, he joined the Roman Church, July the 11th, 1754.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >歌德勇敢地辩解，称温克尔曼是个异教徒，基督教世界的界标对他来说毫无意义。显然，他的伪装不是为了欺骗任何人；在罗马生活时他对宗教法庭的恐惧有时是很明显的；他去罗马时带着伏尔泰的作品，这让他名声蒙羞；担心比瑙伯爵此时对他可能有的看法似乎是他最大的难题。另一方面，他可能一直有某种古典的气质，而这种气质在罗马天主教里好像有一种异教的庄严。从他年轻时候就已厌倦了的晦涩难解的新教中回过头来，他可能想到，在罗马已经接受了文艺复兴的时候，艺术领域的新教原则却已经把德国和最重要的美学传统割裂开了。然而对于那种有着早期世界一般的朴素的透明本质来说，失去绝对的真诚一定已经成为真正的损失了。歌德认为温克尔曼作出了这样的牺牲。然而温克尔曼依然可能会被最高水平的文艺批评所赦免。他对宗教职业不忠仅仅是在一种文化里发生的一件小事情，在这里道德直觉，连同宗教和政治直觉，被淹没在了艺术直觉之中。但那时温克尔曼正是因为对艺术趣味的绝对忠诚而免于平庸，平庸的人不会越雷池一步，只是在一种毫无生气的惯例中周旋，错失了在精神和理性生活中的唯一机会。每次交替出现的强烈动机都会促进文化进步，而且每一次都很强烈，这样的例子一直很多；而我们文化的目标应该是追求尽可能强烈的、也是尽可能完整的生活。但是通常是这样，只有在做出含有单纯和强烈动机的选择，而且这种选择包含放弃为别人预留的皇冠时，这种高层次的生活才会成为可能。哪一种更好呢？是打开一种新知，为人类精神开启一种新的感官，还是培养出多种类型的完美的典范，这种完美，我们仍然被排除在它们的转化力量能触及到的范围之外？萨伏那洛拉是一种成功，温克尔曼是另一种成功。批评界不能否定其中任何一个，因为两种成功对自身来说都是真实的。温克尔曼自己解释了他生活的动力，他说，“如果后世承认我的所著有所价值，那将是对我最大的奖赏。”</td>
		<td class="en">Goethe boldly pleads that Winckelmann was a pagan, that the landmarks of Christendom meant nothing to him. It is clear that he intended to deceive no one by his disguise; fears of the inquisition are sometimes visible during his life in Rome; he entered Rome notoriously with the works of Voltaire in his possession; the thought of what Count Bünau might be thinking of him seems to have been his greatest difficulty. On the other hand, he may have had a sense of a certain antique and as it were pagan grandeur in the Roman Catholic religion. Turning from the crabbed Protestantism, which had been the ennui of his youth, he might reflect that while Rome had reconciled itself to the Renaissance, the Protestant principle in art had cut off Germany from the supreme tradition of beauty. And yet to that transparent nature, with its simplicity as of the earlier world, the loss of absolute sincerity must have been a real loss. Goethe understands that Winckelmann had made this sacrifice. Yet at the bar of the highest criticism, perhaps, Winckelmann may be absolved. The insincerity of his religious profession was only one incident of a culture in which the moral instinct, like the religious or political, was merged in the artistic. But then the artistic interest was that, by desperate faithfulness to which Winckelmann was saved from the mediocrity, which, breaking through no bounds, moves ever in a bloodless routine, and misses its one chance in the life of the spirit and the intellect. There have been instances of culture developed by every high motive in turn, and yet intense at every point; and the aim of our culture should be to attain not only as intense but as complete a life as possible. But often the higher life is only possible at all, on condition of the selection of that in which one’s motive is native and strong; and this selection involves the renunciation of a crown reserved for others. Which is better?—to lay open a new sense, to initiate a new organ for the human spirit, or to cultivate many types of perfection up to a point which leaves us still beyond the range of their transforming power? Savonarola is one type of success; Winckelmann is another; criticism can reject neither, because each is true to itself. Winckelmann himself explains the motive of his life when he says, “It will be my highest reward, if posterity acknowledges that I have written worthily.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在德累斯顿暂时呆了一阵，在这里出版了他的第一本书《希腊绘画雕塑沉思录》。全书充满了晦涩之辞，当歌德最初转向艺术批评时这种晦涩令他感到困惑，但并没有让他不悦。它的目的直接—呼吁从当时虚伪的古典主义里走出来，进行古代作品研究。这本书受到广泛欢迎，他也从国王的忏悔神父那里得到了一笔养老金。1755年9月，他在一个年轻耶稣会士的陪伴下出发去罗马。他被介绍给一位当时知名的画家拉斐尔·门斯，并在画家附近的艺术家聚居区找到了住处，在那里他可以“放眼俯瞰这个不朽的城市”。一开始他不知所措，觉得自己在这块对他而言算是精神故土的土地上成为了陌生人。“不幸的很，”他用法语呼喊——法语是他特意选择来表达强烈感情的。“我是被希腊人称为迟来者的那种人—我来到世界，来到意大利太晚了。”30多年以后，歌德在历经渴求、在心灵上做了很多严肃准备后也去了意大利。歌德和他当年一样，处于青年时期，正在发掘希腊艺术，关于温克尔曼在意大利时期真正艺术家生活的传闻极大地鼓舞了他。他在罗马花了一整年时间从古代作品中汲取养分，为《伊菲革涅亚》做准备。他发现对温克尔曼记忆的刺激因素一直是活跃的。温克尔曼的罗马生活是简单的、原始的、希腊式的。他体质纤弱，只能食用面包和葡萄酒。他被很多人责难为叛教者，所以并无奢望获得名誉，只是希望看到自己的价值被认可，希望能够确定自己的存在。他很朴素却不吝啬，希望自己不贫穷也不富有。</td>
		<td class="en">For a time he remained at Dresden. There his first book appeared, Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works of Art in Painting and Sculpture. Full of obscurities as it was, obscurities which baffled, but did not offend Goethe when he first turned to art-criticism, its purpose was direct—an appeal from the artificial, classicism of the day to the study of the antique. The book was well received, and a pension supplied through the king’s confessor. In September 1755 he started for Rome, in the company of a young Jesuit. He was introduced to Raphael Mengs, a painter then of note, and found a home near him, in the artists’ quarter, in a place where he could “overlook, far and wide, the eternal city.” At first he was perplexed with the sense of being a stranger on what was to him, spiritually, native soil. “Unhappily,” he cries in French, often selected by him as the vehicle of strong feeling, “I am one of those whom the Greeks call òψιμαθεīς.—I have come into the world and into Italy too late.” More than thirty years afterwards, Goethe also, after many aspirtions and severe preparation of mind, visited Italy. In early manhood, just as he, too, was finding Greek art, the rumour of that true artist’s life of Winckelmann in Italy had strongly moved him. At Rome, spending a whole year drawing from the antique, in preparation for Iphigenie, he finds the stimulus of Winckelmann’s memory ever active. Winckelmann’s Roman life was simple, primeval, Greek. His delicate constitution per-mitted him the use only of bread and wine. Condemned by many as a renegade, he had no desire for places of honour, but only to see his merits acknowledged, and existence assured to him. He was simple without being niggardly; he desired to be neither poor nor rich.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Winckelmann’s first years in Rome present all the elements of an intellectual situation of the highest interest. The beating of the soul against its bars, the sombre aspect, the alien traditions, the still barbarous literature of Germany, are afar off; before him are adequate conditions of culture, the sacred soil itself, the first tokens of the advent of the new German literature, with its broad horizons, its boundless intellectual promise. Dante, passing from the darkness of the Inferno, is filled with a sharp and joyful sense of light, which makes him deal with it, in the opening of the Purgatorio, in a wonderfully touching and penetrative way. Hellenism, which is the principle pre-eminently of intellectual light (our modern culture may have more colour, the medieval spirit greater heat and profundity, but Hellenism is pre-eminent for light), has always been most effectively conceived by those who have crept into it out of an intellectual world in which the sombre elements predominate. So it had been in the ages of the Renaissance. This repression, removed at last, gave force and glow to Winckelmann’s native affinity to the Hellenic spirit. “There had been known before him,” says Madame de Staël, “learned men who might be consulted like books; but no one had, if I may say so, made himself a pagan for the purpose of penetrating antiquity.” “One is always a poor executant of conceptions not one’s own.”—On exécute mal ce qu’ on n’a pas conçu soi-même (Words of Charlotte Corday before the Convention.)—are true in their measure of every genuine enthusiasm. Enthusiasm,—that, in the broad Platonic sense of the Phaedrus, was the secret of his divinatory power over the Hellenic world. This enthusiasm, dependent as it is to a great degree on bodily temperament, has a power of re-enforcing the purer emotions of the intellect with an almost physical excitement. That his affinity with Hellenism was not merely intellectual, that the subtler threads of temperament were inwoven in it, is proved by his romantic, fervent friendships with young men. He has known, he says, many young men more beautiful than Guido’s archangel. These friendships, bringing him into contact with the pride of human form, and staining the thoughts with its bloom, perfected his reconciliation to the spirit of Greek sculpture. A letter on taste addressed from Rome to a young nobleman, Friedrich von Berg, is the record of such a friendship.</td></tr>

To such persons the beauty of Greek art will ever seem wanting, because its supreme beauty is rather male than female. But the beauty of art demands a higher sensibility than the beauty of nature, because the beauty of art, like tears shed at a play, gives no pain, is without life, and must be awakened and repaired by culture. Now, as the spirit of culture is much more ardent in youth than in manhood, the instinct of which I am speaking must be exercised and directed to what is beautiful, before that age is reached, at which one would be afraid to confess that one had no taste for it.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Certainly, of that beauty of living form which regulated Winckelmann’s friendships, it could not be said that it gave no pain. One notable friendship, the fortune of which we may trace through his letters, begins with an antique, chivalrous letter in French, and ends noisily in a burst of angry f ire. Far from reaching the quietism, the bland indifference of art, such attachments are nevertheless more susceptible than any others of equal strength of a purely intellectual culture. Of passion, of physical excitement, they contain only just so much as stimulates the eye to the finest delicacies of colour and form. These friendships, often the caprices of a moment, make Winckelmann’s letters, with their troubled colouring, an instructive but bizarre addition to the History of Art, that shrine of grave and mellow light around the mute Olympian family. The impression which Winckelmann’s literary life conveyed to those about him was that of excitement, intuition, inspiration of general principles. The quick, susceptible enthusiast, betraying his temperament even in appearance, by his olive complexion, his deep-seated, piercing eyes, his rapid movements, apprehended the subtlest principles of the Hellenic manner, not through the understanding, but by instinct or touch. A German biographer of Winckelmann has compared him to Columbus. That is not the aptest of comparisons; but it reminds one of a passage in which Edgar Quinet describes the great discoverer’s famous voyage. His science was often at fault; but he had a way of estimating at once the slightest indication of land, in a floating weed or passing bird; he seemed actually to come nearer to nature than other men. And that world in which others had moved with so much embarrassment, seems to call out in Winckelmann new senses fitted to deal with it. He is in touch with it; it penetrates him, and becomes part of his temperament. He remodels his writings with constant renewal of insight; he catches the thread of a whole sequence of laws in some hollowing of the hand, or dividing of the hair; he seems to realise that fancy of the reminiscence of a forgotten knowledge hidden for a time in the mind itself; as if the mind of one, lover and philosopher at once in some phase of pre-existence—φιλοσοφήσας πότε μέτ᾽ ἔρωτος—fallen into a new cycle, were beginning its intellectual career over again, yet with a certain power of anticipating its results. So comes the truth of Goethe’s judgments on his works; they are a life, a living thing, designed for those who are alive—ein Lebendiges für die Leben digen geschrieben, ein Leben selbst.</td></tr>

Pompeii had just opened its treasures; Winckelmann gathered its first fruits. But his plan of a visit to Greece remained unfulfilled. From his first arrival in Rome he had kept the History of Ancient Art ever in view. All his other writings were a preparation for that. It appeared, finally, in 1764; but even after its publication Winckelmann was still employed in perfecting it. It is since his time that many of the most significant examples of Greek art have been submitted to criticism. He had seen little or nothing of what we ascribe to the age of Pheidias; and his conception of Greek art tends, therefore, to put the mere elegance of the imperial society of ancient Rome in place of the severe and chastened grace of the palaestra. For the most part he had to penetrate to Greek art through copies, imitations, and later Roman art itself; and it is not surprising that this turbid medium has left in Winckelmann’s actual results much that a more privileged criticism can correct.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He had been twelve years in Rome. Admiring Ger many had made many calls to him. At last, in 1768, he set out to revisit the country of his birth; and as he left Rome, a strange, inverted home-sickness, a strange reluctance to leave it at all, came over him. He reached Vienna. There he was loaded with honours and presents: other cities were awaiting him. Goethe, then nineteen years old, studying art at Leipsic, was expecting his coming, with that wistful eagerness which marked his youth, when the news of Winckelmann’s murder arrived. All his “weariness of the North” had revived with double force. He left Vienna, intending to hasten back to Rome, and at Trieste a delay of a few days occurred. With characteristic openness, Winckelmann had confided his plans to a fellow-traveller, a man named Arcangeli, and had shown him the gold medals received at Vienna. Arcangeli’s avarice was aroused. One morning he entered Winckelmann’s room, under pretence of taking leave. Winckelmann was then writing “memoranda for the future editor of the History of Art,” still seeking the perfection of his great work. Arcangeli begged to see the medals once more. As Winckelmann stooped down to take them from the chest, a cord was thrown round his neck. Some time afterwards, a child with whose companionship Winckelmann had beguiled his delay, knocked at the door, and receiving no answer, gave the alarm. Winckelmann was found dangerously wound, and died a few hours later, after receiving the last sacraments. It seemed as if the gods, in reward of his devotion to them, had given him a death which, for its swiftness and its opportunity, he might well have desired. “He has,” says Goethe, “the advantage of figuring in the memory of posterity, as one eternally able and strong; for the image in which one leaves the world is that in which one moves among the shadows.” Yet, perhaps, it is not fanciful to regret that his proposed meeting with Goethe never took place. Goethe, then in all the pregnancy of his wonderful youth, still unruffled by the “stress and storm” of his earlier manhood, was awaiting Winckelmann with a curiosity of the worthiest kind. As it was, Winckelmann became to him something like what Virgil was to Dante. And Winckelmann, with his fiery friendships, had reached that age and that period of culture at which emotions hitherto fitful, sometimes concentrate themselves in a vital, unchangeable relation ship. German literary history seems to have lost the chance of one of those famous friendships, the very tradition of which becomes a stimulus to culture, and exercises an imperishable influence.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In one of the frescoes of the Vatican, Raphael has commemorated the tradition of the Catholic religion. Against a space of tranquil sky, broken in upon by the beatific vision are ranged the great personages of Christian history, with the Sacrament in the midst. Another fresco of Raphael in the same apartment presents a very different company, Dante alone appearing in both. Surrounded by the muses of Greek mythology, under a thicket of laurel, sits Apollo, with the sources of Castalia at his feet. On either side are grouped those on whom the spirit of Apollo descended, the classical and Renaissance poets, to whom the waters of Castalia come down, a river making glad this other “city of God.” In this fresco it is the classical tradition, the orthodoxy of taste, that Raphael commemorates. Winckelmann’s intellectual history authenticates the claims of this tradition in human culture. In the countries where that tradition arose, where it still lurked about its own artistic relics, and changes of language had not broken its continuity, national pride might sometimes light up anew an enthusiasm for it. Aliens might imitate that enthusiasm, and classicism become from time to time an intellectual fashion. But Winckelmann was not further removed by language, than by local aspects and associations, from those vestiges of the classical spirit; and he lived at a time when, in Germany, classical studies were out of favour. Yet, remote in time and place, he feels after the Hellenic world, divines those channels of ancient art, in which its life still circulates, and, like Styles, the half-barbarous yet Hellenising king, in the beautiful story of Herodotus, is irresistibly attracted by it. This testimony to the authority of the Hellenic tradition, its fitness to satisfy some vital requirement of the intellect, which Winckelmann contributes as a solitary man of genius, is offered also by the general history of the mind. The spiritual forces of the past, which have prompted and informed the culture of a succeeding age, live, in deed, within that culture, but with an absorbed, under ground life. The Hellenic element alone has not been so absorbed, or content with this underground life; from time to time it has started to the surface; culture has been drawn back to its sources to be clarified and corrected. Hellenism is not merely an absorbed element in our intellectual life; it is a conscious tradition in it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Again, individual genius works ever under conditions of time and place: its products are coloured by the varying aspects of nature, and type of human form; and out ward manners of life. There is thus an element of change in art; criticism must never for a moment forget that “the artist is the child of his time.” But besides these conditions of time and place, and independent of them, there is also an element of permanence, a standard of taste, which genius confesses. This standard is maintained in a purely intellectual tradition. It acts upon the artist, not as one of the influences of his own age, but through those artistic products of the previous generation which first excited, while they directed into a particular channel, his sense of beauty. The supreme artistic products of succeeding generations thus form a series of elevated points, taking each from each the reflection of a strange light, the source of which is not in the atmosphere around and above them, but in a stage of society remote from ours. The standard of taste, then, was fixed in Greece, at a definite historical period. A tradition for all succeeding generations, it originates in a spontaneous growth out of the influences of Greek society. What were the conditions under which this ideal, this standard of artistic orthodoxy, was generated? How was Greece enabled to force its thought upon Europe? </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我们第一次看到希腊艺术时，它和希腊宗教纠缠交错在一起。我们已经习惯把希腊宗教看成是艺术和美的宗教，这一宗教崇拜奥林匹亚的宙斯和雅典娜波利阿斯、以荷马史诗为圣经。所以红衣主教纽曼说，“欢欣高雅的古典多神论在一个文明化的时代里是自然而然的。”然而这样的观点是不全面的，因为它只把目光投向高层次希腊文化睿智辉煌的锋芒上，但却没有看见受它全面冲击的阴暗世界。我们可以十分清晰地看到，希腊宗教既是一种宏伟的仪式体系，又是一整套诗歌概念。正如宗教是按照自然法则从人类生活中发展而来的，它们也被改变人类生活的一切所改变。在明亮的天空下它们变得明亮，当社会范围拓宽时它们变得自由，在精神狭隘受限、黑白颠倒的人类生活缝隙中则会变得激烈尖锐。对这些差异做出详细分析是宗教批判最严肃的功能之一。尽管如此，所有为大众而存在的宗教在纯人类本性中的的广泛根基是一种普遍的异教情感。这种异教情感在希腊宗教之前就已存在，而且迂回地深入到基督教世界里去，根深蒂固地存在，像某种植物的持续生长，因为它的种子正是它赖以成长的土壤的一种成分。</td>
		<td class="en">Greek art, when we first catch sight of it, is entangled with Greek religion. We are accustomed to think of Greek religion as the religion of art and beauty, the religion of which the Olympian Zeus and the Athena Polias are the idols, the poems of Homer the sacred books. Thus Cardinal Newman speaks of “the classical polytheism which was gay and graceful, as was natural in a civilised age.” Yet such a view is only a partial one. In it the eye is fixed on the sharp, bright edge of high Hellenic culture, but loses sight of the sombre world across which it strikes. Greek religion, where we can observe it most distinctly, is at once a magnificent ritualistic system, and a cycle of poetical conceptions. Religions, as they grow by natural laws out of man’s life, are modified by whatever modifies his life. They brighten under a bright sky, they become liberal as the social range widens, they grow intense and shrill in the clefts of human life, where the spirit is narrow and confined, and the stars are visible at noonday; and a fine analysis of these differences is one of the gravest functions of religious criticism. Still, the broad foundation, in mere human nature, of all religions as they exist for the greatest number, is a universal pagan sentiment, a paganism which existed before the Greek religion, and has lingered far onward into the Christian world, ineradicable, like some persistent vegetable growth, because its seed is an element of the very soil out of which it springs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每当它的思想远远地游离出此时此地时，这种异教情感就成了衡量填充人类心灵的悲伤的尺度。它被不可抗拒的自然力量的概念包围，在大部分情况下它与人类相对立，但也是人类财富的秘密，它使土地变成金色，把葡萄也变得火红。人类以自己的形象创造诸神：或是头戴花冠，灿然微笑，亦或受到致命打击，悲伤流血。人类用它们的伤口来安慰自己，一代一代，这些伤口从未痊愈。死亡的想法是带着一股急切的思乡之情出现的。如果可以，人会永远呆在自己的家乡，呆在人世间。当死亡的观念褪去颜色、各种感觉也变得淡薄之时，人们会更加贴近死亡。但是骨肉的腐朽一定会继续，直到最终结束，所以人们又很留意护身的符咒，希望当无可避免的灾难发生时它们可能碰巧会有一些挽救之力。这种情感是所有宗教永恒根基的一部分，它们的确会因时间和地点的不同而更改，但却不会被毁灭，因为它深深植根于人类天性的土壤中。宗教创始者的气息对它们未加理会，它们中的少数“像鹰一样振翼腾空而去”。但是宗教生活的主要层面没有被永久改变。宗教发展和所有纯精神的发展一样，局限于小范围内。这种情感在最初时期附着于父系社会生活的某些习惯做法，比如点火、净身、宰羊、粮食收割、假日和舞蹈。宗教仪式便这样开始了，最初和它传达的情感一样是偶然的，不固定的，但注定会成为宗教生活的永恒元素。父系社会的生活习惯在改变，但是仪式的雏形保留了下来。现在它随着一种自觉的宗教动机而发展，失去了其家族的特性，因此随着世代更迭变得越来越无法解释。这种异教崇拜尽管在各个地区有所不同，但在本质上相同，是所有宗教必有的一种因素。它是宗教原则加诸于使大多数人的生活变得严肃犹豫的法则之上的镇痛剂，就像给无法治愈的病人使用鸦片一样。</td>

He makes gods in his own image, gods smiling and flower-crowned, or bleeding by some sad fatality, to console him by their wounds, never closed from generation to generation. It is with a rush of home-sickness that the thought of death presents itself. He would remain at home for ever on the earth if he could. As it loses its colour and the senses fail, he clings ever closer to it; but since the mouldering of bones and flesh must go on to the end, he is careful for charms and talismans which may chance to have some friendly power in them when the inevitable shipwreck comes. Such sentiment is a part of the eternal basis of all religions, modified indeed by changes of time and place, but indestructib1e, because its root is so deep in the earth of man’s nature. The breath of religious initiators passes over them; a few “rise up with wings as eagles,” but the broad level of religious life is not permanently changed. Religious progress, like all purely spiritual progress, is confined to a few. This sentiment attaches itself in the earliest times to certain usages of patriarchal life, the kindling of fire, the washing of the body, the slaughter of the f lock, the gathering of harvest, holidays and dances. Here are the beginnings of a ritual, at first as occasional and unfixed as the sentiment which it expresses, but destined to become the permanent element of religious life. The usages of patriarchal life change; but this germ of ritual remains, promoted now with a consciously religious motive, losing its domestic character, and therefore becoming more and more in explicable with each generation. Such pagan worship, in spite of local variations, essentially one, is an element in all religions. It is the anodyne which the religious principle, like one administering opiates to the incurable, has added to the law which makes life sombre for the vast majority of mankind.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">More definite religious conceptions come from other sources, and fix themselves upon this ritual in various ways, changing it, and giving it new meanings. In Greece they were derived from mythology, itself not due to a religious source at all, but developing in the course of time into a body of religious conceptions, entirely human in form and character. To the unprogressive ritual element it brought these conceptions, it self—ἡπτεροῦ δύναμις, the power of the wing—an element of refinement, of ascension, with the promise of an end less destiny. While the ritual remains unchanged, the aesthetic element, only accidentally connected with it, expands with the freedom and mobility of the things of the intellect. Always, the fixed element is the religious observance; the fluid, unfixed element is the myth, the religious conception. This religion is itself pagan, and has in any broad view of it the pagan sadness. It does not at once, and for the majority, become the higher Hellenic religion. The country people, of course, cherish the unlovely idols of an earlier time, such as those which Pausanias found still devoutly preserved in Arcadia. Athenaeus tells the story of one who, coming to a temple of Latona, had expected to find some worthy presentment of the mother of Apollo, and laughed on seeing only a shapeless wooden figure. The wilder people have wilder gods, which, however, in Athens, or Corinth, or Lace- daemon, changing ever with the worshippers in whom they live and move and have their being, borrow some thing of the lordliness and distinction of human nature there. Greek religion, too, has its mendicants, its purifications, its antinomian mysticism, its garments offered to the gods, its statues worn with kissing, its exaggerated superstitions for the vulgar only, its worship of sorrow, its addolorata, its mournful mysteries. Scarcely a wild or melancholy note of the medieval church but was anticipated by Greek polytheism! What should we have thought of the vertiginous prophetess at the very centre of Greek religion? The supreme Hellenic culture is a sharp edge of light across this gloom. The fiery, stupefying wine becomes in a happier climate clear and exhilarating. The Dorian8 worship of Apollo, rational, chastened, debonair, with his unbroken daylight, always opposed to the sad Chthonian divinities, is the aspiring element, by force and spring of which Greek religion sublimes itself. Out of Greek religion, under happy conditions, arises Greek art, to minister to human culture. It was the privilege of Greek religion to be able to transform itself into an artistic ideal.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而希腊人对于他们自己的看法以及对于他们与世界的关系的普遍看法，则永远是处于可以转化为感官对象的完全就绪的最佳状态。这构成了希腊艺术和中世纪基督教的神秘艺术的主要区别，后者一直在努力表达超越自己本身的思想。以中世纪的一件典型作品——收藏在佛罗伦萨圣马可教堂修道院里的安吉利科的《圣母加冠》为例。耶稣和圣母坐在月亮形状的奇异的光晕中，他们穿着半似裹尸布、半似教士亚麻衫的神秘白色衣服。基督是《启示录》中那种有着玫瑰红色光轮，蓄着长长的灰白头发，穿着雪白的白麻布圣衣的形象。他正用细长的指尖把一个珍珠皇冠戴在马利亚头上。她举止优雅却如同死尸，身体前倾来接受皇冠，如雪一般的光线洒在她的额头上。当然还不能说安吉利科的壁画把关于人和人与世界的关系的最高层次的思考融入了一种可感知的形式中，但是即使就安吉利科来说他在这点上做得也不到位。对他来说，他作品中所有外在的或者可感知的一切，比如羊毛一样的头发、玫瑰色的光轮和珍珠皇冠都只是他想为思想指出的一个实际上无法被表达出来的世界的象征或者典型。他本来可以从“目光捕捉的就是一切”这样的概念中抽身离去。这种艺术形式对它们所要表达的内容而言是不足的，它们永远处在内容的水平之下。这类情况在东方艺术中也是实际存在的。像中世纪过分的内在化一样，东方在思维方面的模糊不清和对概念的需求，使得呈现给艺术的内容难以驾驭，感觉形式随之的挣扎也是徒劳无谓的。正如安吉利科壁画中的那样，东方多头的神，东方化的、有多个乳房的埃斐索斯的狄安娜，最多是负载过多的象征，是用来暗示一种艺术无法正确或完全表达的、仍处于灵魂世界的观点的方式。</td>
		<td class="en">For the thoughts of the Greeks about themselves, and their relation to the world generally, were ever in the happiest readiness to be transformed into objects for the senses. In this lies the main distinction, between Greek art and the mystical art of the Christian middle age, which is always struggling to express thoughts be yond itself. Take, for instance, a characteristic work of the middle age, Angelico’s Coronation of the Virgin in the cloister of Saint Mark’s at Florence. In some strange halo of a moon Jesus and the Virgin Mother are seated, clad in mystical white raiment, half shroud, half priestly linen. Jesus, with rosy nimbus and the long, pale hair—tanquam lana alba et tanquam nix—of the figure in the Apocalypse, with slender finger-tips is setting a crown of pearl on the head of Mary, who, corpse-like in her refinement, is bending forward to receive it, the light lying like snow upon her forehead. Certainly, it cannot be said of Angelico’s fresco that it throws into a sensible form our highest thoughts about man and his relation to the world; but it did not do this adequately even for Angelico. For him, all that is outward or sensible in his work—the hair like wool, the rosy nimbus, the crown of pearl—is only the symbol or type of a really inexpressible world, to which he wishes to direct the thoughts; he would have shrunk from the notion that what the eye apprehended was all. Such forms of art, then, are inadequate to the matter they clothe; they re main ever below its level. Something of this kind is true also of oriental art. As in the middle age from an exaggerated inwardness, so in the East from a vagueness, a want of definition, in thought, the matter presented to art is unmanageable, and the forms of sense struggle vainly with it. The many-headed gods of the East, the orientalised, many-breasted Diana of Ephesus, like An gelico’s fresco, are at best overcharged symbols, a means of hinting at an idea which art cannot fitly or completely express, which still remains in the world of shadows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是以一件希腊艺术作品《米洛的维纳斯》为例，它绝不是对除了以自身制胜的美丽之外的任何东西的象征或暗示。思维随着有限的形象开始和结束，然而没有损失精神动机的任一部分。这种动机不像意义之于寓言那样，轻轻地、松散地附着在带来美感的形式上，而是充分渗透进它并和它完全一致。希腊精神已经发展到一个自我反思的特殊阶段，但它也警惕着，绝不超越这个阶段。在东方思维中，有一种对生活的模糊概念随处可见，但是却没有思维对它本身的真正理解，没有对人类本性的特质的认识。在它的自我意识中，人性仍然和动物世界及植物世界里虚幻模糊的生命混为一谈。而另一方面，希腊思维中“灵魂的统治”已经得到认可：这种统治赋予人类的双眼、双手和双脚以特权和神力，而毫无活力的自然被放到了次要位置。但是希腊思维正是在此发现了自己不算糟的局限性：它还没有变得过于内在，思维还没有学会夸耀自己相对于肉体的独立，精神既没有凭自己的好恶同化万物，也没有随处展现它的本色。它的确已把自己奉献给了一系列反思，这种反思须在一种夸大的理想主义中以对形式和外在的一切的蔑视中结束。但是这个终结点还很遥远，它还没有陷入宗教的神秘主义之中。</td>
		<td class="en">But take a work of Greek art,—the Venus of Melos. That is in no sense a symbol, a suggestion, of anything beyond its own victorious fairness. The mind begins and ends with the finite image, yet loses no part of the spiritual motive. That motive is not lightly and loosely attached to the sensuous form, as its meaning to an allegory, but saturates and is identical with it. The Greek mind had advanced to a particular stage of self-reflexion, but was careful not to pass beyond it. In oriental thought there is a vague conception of life everywhere, but no true appreciation of itself by the mind, no knowledge of the distinction of man’s nature: in its consciousness of itself, humanity is still confused with the fantastic, indeterminate life of the animal and vegetable world. In Greek thought, on the other hand, the “lordship of the soul” is recognised; that lordship gives authority and divinity to human eyes and hands and feet; inanimate nature is thrown into the background. But just there Greek thought finds its happy limit; it has not yet be come too inward; the mind has not yet learned to boast its independence of the flesh; the spirit has not yet absorbed everything with its emotions, nor reflected its own colour everywhere. It has indeed committed itself to a train of reflexion which must end in defiance of form, of all that is outward, in an exaggerated idealism. But that end is still distant: it has not yet plunged into the depths of religious mysticism.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">This ideal art, in which the thought does not outstrip or lie beyond the proper range of its sensible embodiment, could not have arisen out of a phase of life that was uncomely or poor. That delicate pause in Greek re flexion was joined, by some supreme good luck, to the perfect animal nature of the Greeks. Here are the two conditions of an artistic ideal. The influences which perfected the animal nature of the Greeks are part of the process by which “the ideal” was evolved. Those “Mothers” who, in the second part of Faust, mould and remould the typical forms that appear in human history, preside, at the beginning of Greek culture, over such a concourse of happy physical conditions as ever generates by natural laws some rare type of intellectual or spiritual life. That delicate air, “nimbly and sweetly recommending itself” to the senses, the finer aspects of nature, the finer lime and clay of the human form, and modelling of the dainty frame-work of the human countenance:—these are the good luck of the Greek when he enters upon life. Beauty becomes a distinction, like genius, or noble place. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">“By no people,” says Winckelmann, “has beauty been so highly esteemed as by the Greeks. The priests of a youthful Jupiter at A Egae, of the Ismenian Apollo, and the priest who at Tanagra led the procession of Mercury, bearing a lamb upon his shoulders, were always youths to whom the prize of beauty had been awarded. The citizens of Egesta erected a monument to a certain Philip, who was not their fellow-citizen, but of Croton, for his distinguished beauty; and the people made offerings at it. In an ancient song, ascribed to Simonides or Epicharmus, of four wishes, the first was health, the second beauty. And as beauty was so longed for and prized by the Greeks, every beautiful person sought to become known to the whole people by this distinction, and above all to approve himself to the artists because they awarded the prize; and this was for the artists an occasion for having supreme beauty ever before their eyes. Beauty even gave a right to fame; and we find in Greek histories the most beautiful people distinguished. Some were famous for the beauty of one single part of their form; as Demetrius Phalereus, for his beautiful eyebrows, was called Charito-blepharos. It seems even to have been thought that the procreation of beautiful children might be promoted by prizes. This is shown by the existence of contests for beauty, which in ancient times were established by Cypselus, King of Arcadia, by the river Alpheus; and, at the feast of Apollo of Philae, a prize was offered to the youths for the deftest kiss. This was decided by an umpire; as also at Megara, by the grave of Diodes. At Sparta, and at Lesbos, in the temple of Juno, and among the Parrhasii, there were contests for beauty among women. The general esteem for beauty went so far, that the Spartan women set up in their bed chambers a Nireus, a Narcissus, or a Hyacinth, that they might bear beautiful children.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">So, from a few stray antiquarianisms, a few faces cast up sharply from the waves, Winckelmann, as his manner was, divines the temperament of the antique world, and that in which it had delight. It has passed away with that distant age, and we may venture to dwell upon it. That sharpness and reality it has is the sharpness and reality of suddenly arrested life. The Greek system of gymnastics originated as part of a religious ritual. The worshipper was to recommend himself to the gods by becoming fleet and fair, white and red, like them. The beauty of the palaestra, and the beauty of the artist’s workshop, reacted on one another. The youth tried to rival his gods; and his increased beauty passed back into them.—“I take the gods to witness, I had rather have a fair body than a king’s crown”—Ομνυμι πάνταςθεοὺςμὴἑλἑσθαι ἂν τήν Ββασιλέως ἀρχὴν ἀντὶ τοῦαλὸςεἶναι—that is the form in which one age of the world chose the higher life.—A perfect world, if the gods could have seemed for ever only fleet and fair, white and red! Let us not regret that this unperplexed youth of humanity, satisfied with the vision of itself, passed, at the due moment, into a mournful maturity; for already the deep joy was in store for the spirit, of finding the ideal of that youth still red with life in the grave.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后希腊理想在雕塑中得到出色的表达。所有艺术都有愉悦感官的元素，比如色彩、形状和声音。诗歌是对所有这些元素的灵活再现，同时带着深刻、令人欢欣的动作快感，它们每个都可能成为实现这种理想的媒介。在每个个例中，部分是因为偶然因素更可能成就一个天生的艺术家，诗人或画家，而不是雕塑家。但是因为思想本身也有一种历史发展，一种艺术形式，受到它物质材料的限制，可能比其他艺术形式更能充分表达那种发展的任何阶段。想象力的不同态度天生就与不同类型的感官形式息息相通，所以它们完完全全、轻而易举地结合在一起。因此，艺术可以被排出和人类思想自身发展阶段相对应的序列。为了满足实际需求而产生的建筑只能通过模糊的暗示或者象征来表现艺术家的精神或思想。他把自己的忧伤掩藏，或是在事物令人困惑的错杂关系中徘徊，亦或把自己的目标鲜明诚挚地表达出来，再或者把自己暴露在日光下。但是这些被感知而非亲眼所见的精神因素，只能作为不稳定的效果隐含在建筑形式里，通过反思才能捕捉得到。它们的表达确实根本不能算是带来了美感。因为人类形体并非建筑所涉及的主题，当人类关于自身的想法仍朦胧不清，当不可见的理性世界努力使自身具体化，赋予它一种唯有它可以传达的趣味和意义，而人类还不够关注这种理性世界里那些平静、风暴或胜利时，建筑采用以艺术效果为中心的模式。埃及艺术中建筑取得了至高的成就，根据黑格尔的优美比喻，埃及艺术是一位等待白昼的门农，他等待着希腊精神这种有着雄辩力量的人文精神的白昼来临。</td>
		<td class="en">It followed that the Greek ideal expressed itself pre eminently in sculpture. All art has a sensuous element, colour, form, sound—in poetry a dexterous recalling of these, together with the profound, joyful sensuousness of motion, and each of them may be a medium for the ideal: it is partly accident which in any individual case makes the born artist, poet, or painter rather than sculptor. But as the mind itself has had an historical development, one form of art, by the very limitations of its material, may be more adequate than another for the expression of anyone phase of that development. Different attitudes of the imagination have a native affinity with different types of sensuous form, so that they combine together, with completeness and ease. The arts may thus be ranged in a series, which corresponds to a series of developments in the human mind itself. Architecture, which begins in a practical need, can only express by vague hint or symbol the spirit or mind of the artist. He closes his sadness over him, or wanders in the perplexed intricacies of things, or projects his purpose from him clean-cut and sincere, or bares himself to the sun light. But these spiritualities, felt rather than seen, can but lurk about architectural form as volatile effects, to be gathered from it by reflexion. Their expression is, indeed, not really sensuous at all. As human form is not the subject with which it deals, architecture is the mode in which the artistic effort centres, when the thoughts of man concerning himself are still indistinct, when he is still little preoccupied with those harmonies, storms, victories, of the unseen and intellectual world, which, wrought out into the bodily form, give it an interest and significance communicable to it alone. The art of Egypt, with its supreme architectural effects, is, according to Hegel’s beautiful comparison, a Memnon waiting for the day, the day of the Greek spirit, the humanistic spirit, with its power of speech.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >绘画、音乐、诗歌以其复杂性所赋予它们的无尽的力量，又一次成为浪漫主义时代和当代的特殊艺术。每一种细微的思想和感情，都可以以最简的形式，在其中表达出来，易于催生对其自身感到愉悦的自我意识。通过光与影的交替，复杂的休止符，它们以一种外在的形式投射出热情或情感中最内在的东西。在建筑和绘画、音乐、诗歌等等浪漫主义艺术之间，雕塑产生了。它不同于建筑，它直接涉及人，但又和浪漫艺术不同，因为它并非自我分析的。它比其他涉及人类形态的艺术更专注，它自己就是精神表达的一种完整媒介，随着内心的激动而颤抖、羞愧、融入眼泪中。那种只作为一种不稳定的效果隐藏于建筑中的精神因素，在雕塑中则拿起所有给定的材料，并把一种想象性动机渗入其中。第一眼看上去，有着固体形状的雕塑，似乎是一种比诗歌或绘画的模糊抽象的世界更为真实丰富的东西。然而事实刚好相反。言语和行为对一个人原貌的展示，比对肌肉的拿捏或肉体的塑造更为直接，而诗歌达到了这些要求。绘画通过脸部颜色的润红和眼睛里光线的扩张，音乐通过它精妙的音域都可以最精妙地提炼出某一激情时刻，理出其最难解的头绪。</td>
		<td class="en">Again, painting, music, and poetry, with their endless power of complexity, are the special arts of the romantic and modern ages. Into these, with the utmost attenuation of detail, may be translated every delicacy of thought and feeling, incidental to a consciousness brooding with delight over itself. Through their gradations of shade, their exquisite intervals, they project in an external form that which is most inward in passion or sentiment. Between architecture and those romantic arts of painting, music, and poetry, comes sculpture, which, unlike architecture, deals immediately with man, while it contrasts with the romantic arts because it is not self-analytical. It has to do more exclusively than any other art with the human form, itself one entire medium of spiritual expression, trembling, blushing, melting into dew, with inward excitement. That spirituality which only lurks about architecture as a volatile effect, in sculpture takes up the whole given material, and penetrates it with an imaginative motive; and at first sight sculpture, with its solidity of form, seems a thing more real and full than the faint, abstract world of poetry or painting. Still the fact is the reverse. Discourse and action show man as he is, more directly than the play of the muscles and the moulding of the flesh; and over these poetry has command. Painting, by the flushing of colour in the face and dilatation of light in the eye—music, by its subtle range of tones—can refine most delicately upon a single moment of passion, unravelling its subtlest threads.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是为什么雕塑要把自己限制在纯形式的表达中呢？因为通过这种限制，它成为想象性思维中一种特殊动机的最佳表达媒介。因此它放弃了材料中所有对表达这一主题无益的性质特征。诚然，它一开始对颜色的要求就是不确定的，但是它里面这种颜色的元素总有一些约定俗成的惯例，没有色调的融合或调整，从不允许超出写实主义这个有限的区域。雕塑主要是作为一种宗教传统保留着。而随着雕塑艺术不再只作装饰之用，不再仅是建筑的附属品，它成为了一种纯形式的艺术。它放弃了降低或提升色调这种表达方式。在雕塑里，人类外形的所有部分都同等重要：眼睛很大，没有瞳仁；嘴唇和眉毛与手、胸、脚同样重要。但是它资源的有限性也是它的骄傲：它没有背景，没有天空或空气来暗示或解释一连串的感觉，只有很少的暗示出来的动作，有很多投向发光表面的纯光线，还有纯粹的形态，只有这些而已。然而这种对其特殊动机的局限性对雕塑而言得大于失，它揭开了人在其不变特性的和谐状态的面纱。从行为和感情里愤怒的血迹一般的污点中涤荡出来的那道白光，展现的不是人的偶然性情，而是他内心中与生活中喧嚣的琐事相反的宁静神性。雕塑艺术记录了人类对自身最初天真的、简单的认识。它也是希腊人高超艺术能力的证明，他们理解并真实面对这些高雅的局限，尽管如此，这却给他们的作品赋予了一种灵动的、充满活力的个性。</td>
		<td class="en">But why should sculpture thus limit itself to pure form? Because, by this imitation, it becomes a perfect medium of expression for one peculiar motive of the imaginative intellect. It, therefore, renounces all those attributes of its material which do not forward that motive. It has had, indeed, from the beginning an unfixed claim to colour; but this element of colour in it has always been more or less conventional, with no melting or modulation of tones, never permitting more than a very limited realism. It was maintained chiefly as a religious tradition. In proportion as the art of sculpture ceased to be merely decorative, and subordinate to architecture, it threw itself upon pure form. It renounces the power of expression by lower or heightened tones. In it, no member of the human form is more significant than the rest; the eye is wide, and without pupil; the lips and brow are hardly less significant than hands, and breasts, and feet. But the limitation of its resources is part of its pride: it has no backgrounds, no sky or atmosphere, to suggest and interpret a train of feeling; a little of suggested motion, and much of pure light on its gleaming surfaces, with pure form—only these. And it gains more than it loses by this limitation to its own distinguishing motives; it unveils man in the repose of his unchanging characteristics. That white light, purged from the angry, bloodlike stains of action and passion, reveals, not what is accidental in man, but the tranquil godship in him, as opposed to the restless accidents of life. The art of sculpture records the first naive, unperplexed recognition of man by himself; and it is a proof of the high artistic capacity of the Greeks, that they apprehended and remained true to these exquisite limitations, yet, in spite of them, gave to their creations a mobile, a vital, individuality.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The basis of all artistic genius lies in the power of conceiving humanity in a new and striking way, of putting a happy world of its own creation in place of the meaner world of our common days, generating around itself an atmosphere with a novel power of refraction, selecting, transforming, recombining the images it transmits, according to the choice of the imaginative intellect. In exercising this power, painting and poetry have a variety of subject almost unlimited. The range of characters or persons open to them is as various as life itself; no character, however trivial, misshapen, or unlovely, can resist their magic. That is because those art can accomplish their function in the choice and development of some special situation, which lifts or glorifies a character, in itself not poetical. To realise this situation, to define, in a chill and empty atmosphere, the focus where rays, in themselves pale and impotent, unite and begin to burn, the artist may have, indeed, to employ the most cunning detail, to complicate and refine upon thought and passion a thousand fold. Let us take a brilliant example from the poems of Robert Browning. His poetry is pre-eminently the poetry of situations. The characters themselves are always of secondary importance; often they are characters in themselves of little interest; they seem to come to him by strange accidents from the ends of the world. His gift is shown by the way in which he accepts such a character, throws it into some situation, or apprehends it in some delicate pause of life, in which for a moment it becomes ideal. In the poem entitled Le Byron de nos Jours, in his Dramatis Personae, we have a single moment of passion thrown into relief after this exquisite fashion. Those two jaded Parisians are not intrinsically interesting: they begin to interest us only when thrown into a choice situation. But to discriminate that moment, to make it appreciable by us, that we may “find it”, what a cobweb of allusions, what double and treble reflexions of the mind upon itself, what an artificial light is constructed and broken over the chosen situation; on how fine a needle’s point that little world of passion is balanced! Yet, in spite of this intricacy, the poem has the clear ring of a central motive. We receive from it the impression of one imaginative tone, of a single creative act.</td></tr>

These appliances sculpture cannot command. In it, therefore, not the special situation, but the type, the general character of the subject to be delineated, is all-important. In poetry and painting, the situation predominates over the character; in sculpture, the character over the situation. Excluded by the proper limitation of its material from the development of exquisite situations, it has to choose from a select number of types intrinsically interesting—interesting, that is, independently of any special situation into which they may be thrown. Sculpture finds the secret of its power in presenting these types, in their broad, central, incisive lines. This it effects not by accumulation of detail, but by abstracting from it. All that is accidental, all that distracts the simple effect upon us of the supreme types of humanity, all traces in them of the commonness of the world, it gradually purges away.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Works of art produced under this law, and only these, are really characterised by Hellenic generality or breadth. In every direction it is a law of restraint. It keeps passion always below that degree of intensity at which it must necessarily be transitory, never winding up the features to one note of anger, or desire, or surprise. In some of the feeble allegorical designs of the middle age, we find isolated qualities portrayed as by so many masks; its religious art has familiarised us with faces fixed immovably into blank types of placid reverie. Men and women, again, in the hurry of life, often wear the sharp impress of one absorbing motive, from which it is said death sets their features free. All such instances may be ranged under the grotesque; and the Hellenic ideal has nothing in common with the grotesque. It allows passion to play lightly over the surface of the individual form, losing thereby nothing of its central impassivity, its depth and repose.

Endless as are the attitudes of Greek sculpture, exquisite as is the invention of the Greeks in this direction, the actions or situations it permits are simple and few. There is no Greek Ma donna; the goddesses are always childless. The actions selected are those which would be without significance, except in a divine person—binding on a sandal or pre paring for the bath. When a more complex and significant action is permitted, it is most often represented as just finished, so that eager expectancy is excluded, as in the image of Apollo just after the slaughter of the Python, or of Venus with the apple of Paris already in her hand.

		<td class="en">The hair, so rich a source of expression in painting, because, relatively to the eye or the lip, it is mere drapery, is withdrawn from attention; its texture, as well as its colour, is lost, its arrangement but faintly and severely indicated, with no broken or enmeshed light. The eyes are wide and directionless, not fixing anything with their gaze, nor riveting the brain to any special external object, the brows without hair. Again, Greek sculpture deals almost exclusively with youth, where the moulding of the bodily organs is still as if suspended between growth and completion, indicated but not emphasised; where the transition from curve to curve is so delicate and elusive, that Winckelmann compares it to a quiet sea, which, although we understand it to be in motion, we nevertheless regard as an image of repose; where, therefore, the exact degree of development is so hard to apprehend. If a single product only of Hellenic art were to be saved in the wreck of all beside, one might choose perhaps from the beautiful multitude of the Panathenaic frieze, that line of youths on horseback, with their level glances, their proud, patient lips, their chastened reins, their whole bodies in exquisite service. This colourless, unclassified purity of life, with its blending and interpenetration of intellectual, spiritual, and physical elements, still folded together, pregnant with the possibilities of a whole world closed within it, is the highest expression of the indifference which lies beyond all that is relative or partial. Everywhere there is the effect of an awaking, of a child’s sleep just disturbed. All these effects are united in a single instance—the adorante of the museum of Berlin, a youth who has gained the wrestler’s prize, with hands lifted and open, in praise for the victory. Fresh, unperplexed, it is the image of a man as he springs first from the sleep of nature, his white light taking no colour from any one-sided experience. He is characterless, so far as character involves subjection to the accidental influences of life.</td></tr>

In its poets and orators, its historians and philosophers, Greece cannot be conceived from a central point, unless one brings, as a key to the under standing of it, an insight into the ideal forms of sculpture, and regards the images of statesmen and philosophers, as well as epic and dramatic heroes, from the artistic point of view. For those who act, as well as those who create and think, have, in those beautiful days of Greece, this plastic character. They are great and free, and have grown up on the soil of their own individuality, creating themselves out of themselves, and moulding themselves to what they were, and willed to be. The age of Pericles was rich in such characters; Pericles him self, Pheidias, Plato, above all Sophocles, Thucydides also, Xenophon and Socrates, each in his own order, the perfection of one remaining undiminished by that of the others. They are ideal artists of themselves, cast each in one f lawless mould, works of art, which stand before us as an immortal presentment of the gods. Of this modelling also are those bodily works of art, the victors in the Olympic games; yes! and even Phryne9, who, as the most beautiful of women, ascended naked out of the water, in the presence of assembled Greece.” </td></tr>

		<td class="en">This key to the understanding of the Greek spirit, Winckelmann possessed in his own nature, itself like a relic of classical antiquity, laid open by accident to our alien, modern atmosphere. To the criticism of that consummate Greek modelling he brought not only his culture but his temperament. We have seen how definite was the leading motive of that culture; how, like some central root-fibre, it maintained the well-rounded unity of his life through a thousand distractions. Interests not his, nor meant for him, never disturbed him. In morals, as in criticism, he followed the clue of instinct, of an unerring instinct. Penetrating into the antique world by his passion, his temperament, he enunciated no formal principles, always hard and one-sided. Minute and anxious as his culture was, he never became one-sidedly self-analytical. Occupied ever with himself, perfecting himself and developing his genius, he was not content, as so often happens with such natures, that the atmosphere between him and other minds should be thick and clouded; he was ever jealously refining his meaning into a form, express, clear, objective. This temperament he nurtured and invigorated by friendships kept him always in direct contact with the spirit of youth. The beauty of the Greek statues was a sexless beauty: the statues of the gods had the least traces of sex. Here there is a moral sexlessness, a kind of ineffectual wholeness of nature, yet with a true beauty and significance of its own.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One result of this temperament is a serenity—Heiterkeit—which characterises Winckelmann’s handling of the sensuous side of Greek art. This serenity is, perhaps, in great measure, a negative quality: it is the absence of any sense of want, or corruption, or shame. With the sensuous element in Greek art he deals in the pagan manner; and what is implied in that? It has been some times said that art is a means of escape from “the tyranny of the senses.” It may be so for the spectator: he may find that the spectacle of supreme works of art takes from the life of the senses something of its turbid fever. But this is possible for the spectator only because the artist, in producing those works, has gradually sunk his intellectual and spiritual ideas in sensuous form. He may live, as Keats lived, a pure life; but his soul, like that of Plato’s false astronomer, becomes more and more immersed in sense, until nothing which lacks the appeal to sense has interest for him. How could such a one ever again endure the greyness of the ideal or spiritual world? The spiritualist is satisfied as he watches the escape of the sensuous elements from his conceptions; his interest grows, as the dyed garment bleaches in the keener air. But the artist steeps his thought again and again into the fire of colour. To the Greek this immersion in the sensuous was, religiously, at least, indifferent. Greek sensuousness, therefore, does not fever the conscience: it is shameless and childlike. Christian asceticism, on the other hand, discrediting the slightest touch of sense, has from time to time provoked into strong emphasis the contrast or antagonism to itself, of the artistic life, with its inevitable sensuousness.—I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and lo! I must die.—It has sometimes seemed hard to pursue that life without something of conscious disavowal of a spiritual world; and this imparts to genuine artistic interests a kind of intoxication. From this intoxication Winckelmann is free: he fingers those pagan marbles with unsinged hands, with no sense of shame or loss. That is to deal with the sensuous side of art in the pagan manner.</td></tr>

But if he was to be saved from the ennui which ever attaches itself to realisation, even the realisation of the perfect life, it was necessary that a conflict should come, that some sharper note should grieve the existing harmony, and the spirit chafed by it beat out at last only a larger and profounder music. In Greek tragedy this conflict has begun: man finds himself face to face with rival claims. Greek tragedy shows how such a conflict may be treated with serenity, how the evolution of it may be a spectacle of the dignity, not of the impotence, of the human spirit. But it is not only in tragedy that the Greek spirit showed itself capable of thus bringing joy out of matter in itself full of discouragements. Theocritus10, too, strikes often a note of romantic sadness. But what a blithe and steady poise, above these discouragements, in a clear and sunny stratum of the air!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Into this stage of Greek achievement Winckelmann did not enter. Supreme as he is where his true interest lay, his insight into the typical unity and repose of the highest sort of sculpture seems to have involved limitation in another direction. His conception of art excludes that bolder type of it which deals confidently and serenely with life, conflict, evil. Living in a world of exquisite but abstract and colourless form, he could hardly have conceived of the subtle and penetrative, yet somewhat grotesque art of the modern world. What would he have thought of Gilliatt, in Victor Hugo’s Travailleurs de la Mer, or of the bleeding mouth of Fantine in the first part of Les Misérables, penetrated as those books are with a sense of beauty, as lively and transparent as that of a Greek? Nay, a sort of preparation for the romantic temper is noticeable even within the limits of the Greek ideal itself, which for his part Winckelmann failed to see. For Greek religion has not merely its mournful mysteries of Adonis, of Hyacinthus, of Demeter, but it is conscious also of the fall of earlier divine dynasties. Hyperion gives way to Apollo, Oceanus to Poseidon. Around the feet of that tranquil Olympian family still crowd the weary shadows of an earlier, more formless, divine world. The placid minds even of Olympian gods are troubled with thoughts of a limit to duration, of inevitable decay, of dispossession. Again, the supreme and colourless abstraction of those divine forms, which is the secret of their repose, is also a premonition of the fleshless, consumptive refinements of the pale, medieval artists. That high indifference to the outward, that impassivity, has already a touch of the corpse in it: we see already Angelico and the Master of the Passion in the artistic future. The suppression of the sensuous, the shutting of the door upon it, the ascetic interest, may be even now foreseen. Those abstracted gods, “ready to melt out their essence fine into the winds,” who can fold up their flesh as a garment, and still remain themselves, seem already to feel that bleak air in which, like Helen of Troy, they wander as the spectres of the middle age.</td></tr>

But Christian art was still dependent on pagan examples, building the shafts of pagan temples into its churches, perpetuating the form of the basilica, in later times working the disused amphitheatres as stone quarries. The sensuous expression of ideas which unreservedly discredit the world of sense, was the delicate problem which Christian art had before it. If we think of medieval painting, as it ranges from the early German schools, still with something of the air of the charnel- house about them, to the clear loveliness of Perugino, we shall see how that problem was solved. In the very “worship of sorrow” the native blitheness of art asserted itself. The religious spirit, as Hegel says, “smiled through its tears.” So perfectly did the young Raphael infuse that Heiterkeit, that pagan blitheness, into religious works, that his picture of Saint Agatha at Bologna became to Goethe a step in the evolution of IPhigenie (Italiänische Reise. Bologna, 19 Oct. 1776.).

The two are really continuous; and there is a sense in which it may be said that the Renaissance was an uninterrupted effort of the middle age, that it was ever taking place. When the actual relics of the antique were restored to the world, in the view of the Christian ascetic it was as if an ancient plague-pit had been opened. All the world took the contagion of the life of nature and of the senses. And now it was seen that the medieval spirit, too, had done something for the new fortunes of the antique. By hastening the decline of art, by withdrawing interest from it and yet keeping unbroken the thread of its traditions, it had suffered the human mind to repose itself, that when day came it might awake, with eyes refreshed, to those ancient, ideal forms.</td></tr>

For, after all, he is infinitely less than Goethe; and it is chiefly because at certain points he comes in contact with Goethe, that criticism entertains consideration of him. His relation to modern culture is a peculiar one. He is not of the modern world; nor is he wholly of the eighteenth century, although so much of his outer life is characteristic of it. But that note of revolt against the eighteenth century, which we detect in Goethe, was struck by Winckelmann. Goethe illustrates a union of the Romantic spirit, in its adventure, its variety, its profound subjectivity of soul, with Hellenism, in its transparency, its rationality, its desire of beauty—that marriage of Faust and Helena, of which the art of the nineteenth century is the child, the beautiful lad Euphorion, as Goethe conceives him, on the crags, in the “splendour of battle and in harness as for victory,” his brows bound with light (Faust, Th. ii. Act. 3.). Goethe illustrates, too, the preponderance in this marriage of the Hellenic element; and that element, in its true essence, was made known to him by Winckelmann.</td></tr>

Yet, not less than ever, the intellect demands completeness, centrality. It is this which Winckelmann imprints on the imagination of Goethe, at the beginning of life, in its original and simplest form, as in a fragment of Greek art itself, stranded on that littered, indeterminate shore of Germany in the eighteenth century. In Winckelmann, this type comes to him, not as in a book or a theory, but more importunately, because in a passionate life, in a personality.

		<td class="en">It could no longer be solved, as in Phyrne ascending naked out of the water, by perfection of bodily form, or any joyful union with the external world: the shadows had grown too long, the light too solemn, for that. It could hardly be solved, as in Pericles or Pheidias, by the direct exercise of any single talent: amid the manifold claims of our modern intellectual life, that could only have ended in a thin, one-sided growth. Goethe’s Hellenism was of another order, the Allgemeinheit and Heiterkeit, the completeness and serenity, of a watchful, exigent intellectualism. Im Ganzen, Guten, Wahren, resolut zu leben:—is Goethe’s description of his own higher life; and what is meant by life in the whole—im Ganzen? It means the life of one for whom, over and over again, what was once precious has become indifferent. Everyone who aims at the life of culture is met by many forms of it, arising out of the intense, laborious, one-sided development of some special talent. They are the brightest enthusiasms the world has to show: and it is not their part to weigh the claims which this or that alien form of genius makes upon them. But the proper instinct of self-culture cares not so much to reap all that those various forms of genius can give, as to find in them its own strength. The demand of the intellect is to feel itself alive. It must see into the laws, the operation, the intellectual reward of every divided form of culture; but only that it may measure the relation between itself and them. It struggles with those forms till its secret is won from each, and then lets each fall back into its place, in the supreme, artistic view of life. With a kind of passionate coldness, such natures rejoice to be away from and past their former selves, and above all, they are jealous of that abandonment to one special gift which really limits their capabilities. It would have been easy for Goethe, with the gift of a sensuous nature, to let it overgrow him. It comes easily and naturally, perhaps, to certain “other worldly” natures to be even as the Schöne Seele, that ideal of gentle pietism, in Wilhelm Meister: but to the large vision of Goethe, this seemed to be a phase of life that a man might feel all round, and leave behind him. Again, it is easy to indulge the commoplace metaphysical instinct. But a taste for metaphysics may be one of those things which we must renounce, if we mean to mould our lives to artistic perfection. Philosophy serves culture, not by the fancied gift of absolute or transcendental knowledge, but by suggesting questions which help one to detect the passion, and strangeness, and dramatic contrasts of life.</td></tr>

We have seen that the development of the various forms of art has corresponded to the development of the thoughts of man concerning humanity, to the growing revelation of the mind to itself.

		<td class="en">Let us understand by poetry all literary production which attains the power of giving pleasure by its form, as distinct from its matter. Only in this varied literary form can art command that width, variety, delicacy of resources, which will enable it to deal with the conditions of modern life. What modern art has to do in the ser vice of culture is so to rearrange the details of modern life, so to reflect it, that it may satisfy the spirit. And what does the spirit need in the face of modern life? The sense of freedom. That naive, rough sense of freedom, which supposes man’s will to be limited, if at all, only by a will stronger than his, he can never have again. The attempt to represent it in art would have so little verisimilitude that it would be f lat and uninteresting. The chief factor in the thoughts of the modern mind concerning itself is the intricacy, the universality of natural law, even in the moral order. For us, necessity is not, as of old, a sort of mythological personage without us, with whom we can do warfare. It is rather a magic web woven through and through us, like that magnetic system of which modern science speaks, penetrating us with a network, subtler than our subtlest nerves, yet bearing in it the central forces of the world. Can art represent men and women in these bewildering toils so as to give the spirit at least an equivalent for the sense of freedom? Certainly, in Goethe’s romances, and even more in the romances of Victor Hugo, we have high examples of modern art dealing thus with modern life, regarding that life as the modern mind must regard it, yet reflecting upon it blitheness and repose. Natural laws we shall never modify, embarrass us as they may; but there is still something in the nobler or less noble attitude with which we watch their fatal combinations. In those romances of Goethe and Victor Hugo, in some excellent work done after them, this entanglement, this network of law, be comes the tragic situation, in which certain groups of noble men and women work out for themselves a supreme Dénouement. Who, if he saw through all, would fret against the chain of circumstance which endows one at the end with those great experiences?</td></tr>

What is the whole physical life in that moment but a combination of natural elements to which science gives their names? But those elements, phosphorus and lime and delicate fibres, are present not in the human body alone: we detect them in places most remote from it. Our physical life is a perpetual motion of them—the passage of the blood, the waste and repairing of the lenses of the eye, the modification of the tissues of the brain under every ray of light and sound—processes which science reduces to simpler and more elementary forces. Like the elements or which we are composed, the action of these forces extends beyond us: it rusts iron and ripens corn. Far out on every side of us those elements are broadcast, driven in many currents; and birth and gesture and death and the springing of violets from the grave are but a few out of ten thousand resultant combinations. That clear, perpetual outline of face and limb is but an image of ours, under which we group them—a design in a web, the actual threads of which pass out beyond it.

		<td class="en">Or, if we begin with the inward world of thought and feeling, the whirlpool is still more rapid, the flame more eager and devouring. There it is no longer the gradual darkening of the eye, the gradual fading of colour from the wall—movements of the shore-side, where the water flows down indeed, though in apparent rest—but the race of the mid-stream, a drift of momentary acts of sight and passion and thought. At first sight experience seems to bury us under a flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves in a thousand forms of action. But when reflexion begins to play upon those objects they are dissipated under its influence; the cohesive force seems suspended like some trick of magic; each object is loosed into a group of impressions—colour, odour, texture—in the mind of the observer. And if we continue to dwell in thought on this world, not of objects in the solidity with which language invests them, but of impressions, unstable, flickering, inconsistent, which burn and are extinguished with our consciousness of them, it contracts still further: the whole scope of observation is dwarfed into the narrow chamber of the individual mind. Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without. Everyone of those impressions is the impression of the individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world. Analysis goes a step farther still, and assures us that those impressions of the individual mind to which, for each one of us, experience dwindles down, are in perpetual flight; that each of them is limited by time, and that as time is infinitely divisible, each of them is infinitely divisible also; all that is actual in it being a single moment, gone while we try to apprehend it, of which it may ever be more truly said that it has ceased to be than that it is. To such a tremulous wisp constantly reforming itself on the stream, to a single sharp impression, with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting, of such moments gone by, what is real in our life fines itself down. It is with this movement, with the passage and dissolution of impressions, images, sensations, that analysis leaves off—that continual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual weaving and unweaving of ourselves.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One of the most beautiful passages of Rousseau is that in the sixth book of the Confessions, where he de scribes the awakening in him of the literary sense. An undefinable taint of death had clung always about him, and now in early manhood he believed himself smitten by mortal disease. He asked himself how he might make as much as possible of the interval that remained; and he was not biassed by anything in his previous life when he decided that it must be by intellectual excitement, which he found just then in the clear, fresh writings of Voltaire. Well! we are all condamnés as, Victor Hugo says: we are all under sentence of death but with a sort of indefinite reprieve—les hommes sont tous condamnés à mort avec des sursis indéfinis: we have an interval, and then our place knows us no more. Some spend this interval in listlessness, some in high passions, the wisest, at least among the children of this world, in art and song. For our one chance lies in expanding that interval, in getting as many pulsations as possible into the given time. Great passions may give us this quickened sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various forms of enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which come naturally to many of us. Only be sure it is passion—that it does yield you this fruit of a quickened, multiplied consciousness. Of such wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for its own sake, has most. For art comes to you proposing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply for those moments’ sake. </td></tr>
