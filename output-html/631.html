		<td class="en">“Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,” said Holmes in a reminiscent voice. “It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimms’ fairy tale.

Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can’t beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hungary .

This agency stands flat footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr. Robert Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be from him and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之前他光顾着研究前面所说的那封短柬，没有理会摆在桌上的另一封信，到这会儿才把它拿了起来。刚开始读的时候，他脸上带着兴致盎然的笑容，读着读着，他的笑容渐渐褪去，取而代之的是一种紧张专注的神情。读完之后，他坐在那里沉思了一小会儿，夹在指间的信纸晃来晃去。接下来，他猛一激灵，回过了神。</td>
		<td class="en">He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table while he had been absorbed with the first. This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley’s and Harvey’s and Carriton’s—the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“的确如此。”福尔摩斯不咸不淡地说道。他骄傲内敛的天性之中包含着一个特异之处，也就是说，他会不声不响地把新的知识变成脑子里的精确记忆，但却很少会向知识的提供者表示任何谢意。“按我看，事情结束之前，咱们对奇斯曼宅邸的了解肯定会比现在多得多。不出我的预料，这封信确实是罗伯特·弗格森写来的。对了，他还说他认识你呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Precisely ,” said Holmes coldly. It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that though he docketed any fresh information very quietly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver. “I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman’s, Lamberley, before we are through. The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">> Dear Mr. Holmes [it said]:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 我的律师建议我向您请教，不过，这件事情实在是极其敏感，简直让人难于启齿。事情牵涉到我的一个朋友，我是代表他来跟您联系的。大概五年之前，这位先生娶了一位秘鲁商人的女儿，他跟这位商人的交情是通过进口硝酸盐业务建立起来的。他的妻子非常美丽，只可惜出身异国，信的又是异教，以致夫妻之间总是有点儿志趣不合。这样一来，一段时间之后，他兴许已经不再像以前那样深爱他的妻子，兴许还觉得这场婚姻是个错误。按他的感觉，妻子的性情之中包含着一些他永远无法触及、永远无法理解的因素。这样的局面格外让人痛苦，因为她是个再痴心不过的好妻子，从各方面来看都对丈夫死心塌地。</td>
		<td class="en">> I have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady, the daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have—to all appearance absolutely devoted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 接下来我打算讲一讲大致的情况，详情可以等我们见面的时候再谈。说实在的，这封信只是想让您对事态有一个整体的了解，同时也想问一问您，是否愿意介入此事。他的妻子已经表现出了一些怪异的毛病，跟她平常那种温柔可爱的性情大相径庭。这位先生结了两次婚，前妻给他留下了一个儿子。这孩子已经十五岁了，非常惹人疼爱，而且非常孝顺，只可惜童年的时候遇上过一次意外，受到了严重的伤害。有人两次撞见这个做妻子的无缘无故地痛打这个可怜的孩子，有一次还用上了手杖，把孩子的胳膊打出了一道可怕的血印。</td>
		<td class="en">> Now for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. The lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. T wice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 不过，跟她对待亲生儿子的方法相比，前面这些都只能算是小事一桩。她的儿子将近一岁，是个非常可爱的婴孩。有那么一次，时间大概是一个月之前，保姆去了别处，让这个婴孩自个儿待了几分钟。婴孩突然大声哭喊，似乎是觉得疼痛，吓得保姆赶紧跑了回去。跑进房间的时候，她发现女主人趴在婴孩身上，显然是正在咬婴孩的脖子。婴儿的脖子上有个小小的伤口，还有一道血迹。保姆惊骇万分，当时就想去叫男主人，女主人却恳求她不要这么做，还实实在在地给了她五镑封口费。女主人没作任何解释，这场风波就算是暂时平息了。</td>
		<td class="en">> This was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck from which a stream of blood had escaped. The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 不过，这件事情给保姆留下了可怕的印象，她从此就密切地留意着女主人的举动，对婴孩的看护也更加仔细，因为她很疼这个孩子。按她的感觉，她监视着孩子的母亲，孩子的母亲也在监视她，每当她被迫撇下孩子的时候，孩子的母亲总是在等着接近孩子。保姆日日夜夜地保护着孩子，这位无声无息、全神戒备的母亲也日日夜夜地守在一旁，仿佛是一头窥伺羊羔的恶狼。读到这里，您一定觉得难以置信，可我恳求您务必认真对待，因为这件事情关系到一个孩子的生死，还关系到一个男人能否保全自己的神志。</td>
		<td class="en">> It left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse’s mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely and to keep a closer guard upon the baby , whom she tenderly loved. It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child’s life and a man’s sanity may depend upon it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 可怕的日子终于降临，因为保姆无法再对男主人隐瞒真相。她已经精神崩溃，再也承受不起这样的压力，于是就向男主人坦白了一切。您兴许觉得这些都是天方夜谭，他刚开始的感觉也跟您一样。他知道妻子对他情深爱重，对孩子也是呵护备至，只有殴打继子的事情是个例外。既然如此，她怎么会伤害她亲生的小宝贝呢？他斥责保姆白日做梦，说她的怀疑全都是疯子的妄想，还说她这种诽谤女主人的行为实在是让人无法容忍。话还没有说完，屋里突然响起了一声痛苦的叫喊，他就和保姆一起冲进了儿童房。他看见他妻子正从婴儿床的旁边直起身来，又看见孩子的脖子露在外面，脖子和床单上都有血迹，想想吧，福尔摩斯先生，他当时是一种怎样的感觉。男主人惊骇地大叫一声，把妻子的脸转到亮处，立刻发现妻子的嘴上沾满了鲜血。是她，绝绝对对是她，刚刚吸了这个可怜婴孩的血。</td>
		<td class="en">> At last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. The nurse’s nerve had given way; she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. While they were talking a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery . Imagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot and saw blood upon the child’s exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he turned his wife’s face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. It was she—she beyond all question—who had drunk the poor baby’s blood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 他家的情况就是这样。眼下呢，做妻子的把自己关在了房间里，没有提供任何解释，做丈夫的则处于神经错乱的边缘。对于吸血鬼，他跟我都是只闻其名，本来还以为这仅仅是异国他乡的无稽之谈呢。没想到，这样的事情竟然出现在了英格兰萨塞克斯郡的心脏地带。算了，这些事情还是等明天上午见面的时候再谈吧。您愿意见我吗？愿意用您的非凡本领帮助一个六神无主的人吗？愿意的话，麻烦您发封电报到兰伯里的奇斯曼宅邸，收报人就写弗格森。收到电报之后，我会在明天上午十点钟登门求教。</td>
		<td class="en">> So the matter stands. She is now confined to her room. There has been no explanation. The husband is half demented. He knows, and I know , little of vampirism beyond the name. We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex—well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. Will you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman’s, Lamberley , and I will be at your rooms by ten o’clock.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">> Robert Ferguson.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 又：据我所知，您的朋友华生曾经是布莱克希斯橄榄球俱乐部的队员，当时我是里奇蒙俱乐部的中卫[^6]。关于这次会面，我只有这么一点儿引见之资。</td>
		<td class="en">> P. S. I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction which I can give.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我当然记得他，”我一边说，一边把信放回了桌子上。“大块头鲍勃·弗格森[^7]可是里奇蒙俱乐部有史以来最棒的中卫呢。他这个人一向热心，像这样为朋友的事情牵肠挂肚，确实是他的作风。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Of course I remembered him,” said I as I laid down the letter. “Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always a good-natured chap. It’s like him to be so concerned over a friend’s case.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >福尔摩斯若有所思地看着我，摇了摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我真不知道你智力的底线在哪里，华生。”他说道。“你总是能抛出一些让我惊异的想法。好了，乖乖地帮我写封电报吧，电文是‘乐意调查您的事情。’”</td>
		<td class="en">“I never get your limits, Watson,” said he. “There are unexplored possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow. ‘Will examine your case with pleasure.’ ”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天上午十点整，弗格森大步走进了我们的房间。我记忆中的他是个颀长瘦削的人，凭借敏捷的身手和飞快的速度突破过不知道多少名敌方后卫的拦截。可想而知，如果你见过一位优秀运动员全盛时期的模样，眼下却发现他仅余骸骨，就会觉得人生之中的憾事莫过于此。他伟岸的身形已经坍塌，亚麻色的头发稀稀拉拉，肩背也佝偻如弓。要我说，看到我的时候，他恐怕也产生了同样的感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">Promptly at ten o’clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed which had carried him round many an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，华生，”他开口说道，声音倒是跟以前一样浑厚热忱。“那一次在老鹿公园[^8]，我把你隔着绳子扔进了人群，要我说，你眼下的样子可跟那时大不一样啦。依我看，我自个儿肯定也变了一点儿。不过，最近这一两天才真是让我老了不少。福尔摩斯先生，您的电报已经让我明白，假装别人的代表是一件毫无用处的事情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hullo, Watson,” said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty . “You don’t look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit also. But it’s this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr. Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone’s deputy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还是直来直去比较简单。”福尔摩斯说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is simpler to deal direct,” said Holmes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是自然。可您肯定能够理解，我谈论的是我最应该保护、最应该帮助的那个女人，确实是很难开口。我能怎么办呢？总不能把这样的事情交给警察吧？可是，孩子们的安全也不能不保护啊。这只是一时的疯狂吗，福尔摩斯先生？会不会是天生的呢？您以前见过类似的事情吗？看在上帝分上，给我一些指点吧，我真的已经一筹莫展了啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Of course it is. But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help. What can I do? How am I to go to the police with such a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. Is it madness, Mr. Holmes? Is it something in the blood? Have you any similar case in your experience? For God’s sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wit’s end.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您这种反应十分正常，弗格森先生。好了，您到这边坐下，打起精神好好回答我几个问题。我可以跟您打包票，我不仅是远远没到一筹莫展的地步，而且有信心找出一个解决的办法。首先，请您把您已经采取的措施告诉我。您的妻子还在孩子们的身边吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Very naturally, Mr. Ferguson. Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wit’s end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the children?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当时的场面可怕极了。她是个情深爱重的女人，福尔摩斯先生。要说这世上有哪个女人全心全意地爱过一个男人的话，她就是这么爱我的。看到我撞破了她那个毛骨悚然、匪夷所思的秘密，她伤心到了极点。她连话都不肯说，根本不反驳我的指责，只是直勾勾地看着我，眼神又狂野又绝望。接下来，她一头冲进自己的房间，把自己锁了起来，再也不肯跟我见面。她有个从娘家带来的女仆，名字叫做多洛雷丝，不像是她的仆人，倒像是她的朋友。这个女仆负责给她送饭。”</td>
		<td class="en">“We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr. Holmes. If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see me. She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name—a friend rather than a servant. She takes her food to her.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“No, she struck him savagely . It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.” Ferguson’s gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. “You would think that the dear lad’s condition would soften anyone’s heart.

It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings with towering T udor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man after the original builder.

The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady upstairs.

Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly .</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这个时候，我无意中瞥了一眼福尔摩斯，发现他脸上带着一种极其古怪的专注神情。他的面容凝固不变，如同一件古老的牙雕，他的眼睛只在父子俩的身上停留了一个瞬间，这会儿已经充满好奇地盯住了房间对面。我顺着他的目光看了看，但却只能推想他看的是窗外那个水珠滴答的阴郁花园。窗外的景色确实已经被窗板遮掉了一半，可我仍然能够断定，他专心凝望的正是那扇窗子。</td>
		<td class="en">It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来，他微微一笑，目光回到了婴孩身上。婴孩的脖子胖乎乎的，上面印着那个小小的疤痕。福尔摩斯不声不响地把伤疤仔细检查了一遍，然后就握了握婴孩的小拳头。肉嘟嘟的小拳头漾着小涡，一直在他面前晃来晃去。</td>
		<td class="en">Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby . On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把保姆带到一边，郑重其事地聊了几分钟。我只听见了他最后的一句话：“照我看，你很快就不用再担心啦。”从外表上看，保姆是一个性情乖僻、沉默寡言的人。聊完之后，她抱着婴孩离开了房间。</td>
		<td class="en">He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard the last words, which were: “Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.” The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去吧，小杰克。”他说了一句，然后就深情地目送着儿子走出房间。“好了，福尔摩斯先生，”少年出去之后，他接着说道，“我真的觉得，这次我让您白跑了一趟，除了同情之外，您还能给我什么呢？从您的角度来看，这肯定是一件格外难办、格外复杂的事情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Run away, little Jacky,” said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. “Now, Mr. Holmes,” he continued when the boy was gone, “I really feel that I have brought you on a fool’s errand, for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy? It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“难办是肯定的，”我朋友被主人的话逗得笑了起来，“复杂嘛，我到现在还没觉得。我的想法原本只是主观演绎的成果，不过，互不相关的众多细节已经一点一点地证明了我的演绎成果，这样一来，主观就变成了客观，咱们也就可以胸有成竹地宣布，咱们的目标已经实现。事实上，早在咱们离开贝克街之前，我已经实现了这个目标，剩下的工作仅仅是观察和确证而已。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is certainly delicate,” said my friend with an amused smile, “but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity . It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. I had, in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“For heaven’s sake, Holmes,” he said hoarsely; “if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Oh, yes, she will,” said Holmes. He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper. “You at least have the entrée, Watson. Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我又一次上了楼，多洛雷丝如临大敌地打开了房门，我把条子交给了她。一分钟之后，房间里响起一声惊喜交集的呼喊，多洛雷丝探出头来。</td>

		<td class="en">At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an armchair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I think we can dispense with Dolores,” said Holmes. “Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. Now, Mr. Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me first say what will ease your mind. Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那我就跟您讲讲，在贝克街的时候，从我心头掠过的是怎样一串环环相扣的演绎。我一向觉得，吸血鬼的说法纯属荒诞无稽。那样的事情绝不会出现在英格兰的犯罪活动当中。话又说回来，您的观察结果倒是准确无误。您看见的事情是这位女士从婴儿床旁边直起身来，嘴上还沾着鲜血。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd.
