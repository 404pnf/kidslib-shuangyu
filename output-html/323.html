		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那天天气毕竟是很理想。就是提前定制，也不会有比这更完美的天气更适合举行花园茶会了。没有风，天气温暖和煦，天空中没有一丝云彩。唯有蓝天上笼罩着一层淡淡的金色的烟雾，就像有时初夏时节天空呈现的那样。园丁黎明时分就起来修剪、清理草坪了，直到整片草地和种雏菊的深色平坦的玫瑰形花坛都似乎在发光。至于玫瑰，你禁不住就会觉得它们对这一点是了解的：在花园茶会上，只有玫瑰让人印象深刻，只有玫瑰众人皆知。玫瑰在一夜之间就开了数百朵，是的，足有数百朵。绿色的灌木丛弯下了身子，仿佛有天使长来拜访过。</td>
		<td class="en">And after all the weather was ideal.They could not have had a more perfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it.Windless, warm, the sky without a cloud.Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light gold, as it is sometimes in early summer.The gardener had been up since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine.As for the roses, you could not help feeling they understood that roses are the only flowers that impress people at garden-parties; the only flowers that everybody is certain of knowing.Hundreds, yes, literally hundreds, had come out in a single night; the green bushes bowed down as though they had been visited by archangels.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >早餐还没结束，就有工人来搭帐篷了。</td>
		<td class="en">Breakfast was not yet over before the men came to put up the marquee.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“母亲，您想把帐篷搭哪儿？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Where do you want the marquee put, mother?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的孩子，这个不用问我。我决定今年把一切事都交给你们这些孩子们负责。别想着我是你们的母亲。就当我是一个贵客好了。</td>
		<td class="en">“My dear child, it’s no use asking me.I’m determined to leave everything to you children this year.Forget I am your mother.Treat me as an honoured guest.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是梅格是不可能去管那些人的。早餐前她洗了头，现在正坐着喝咖啡。她头上裹了块绿色的头巾，两边脸颊上各贴着一个深色的湿发卷。那蝴蝶似的乔斯下楼时总是穿着一条丝绸衬裙和一件和服式的短上衣。</td>
		<td class="en">But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men.She had washed her hair before breakfast, and she sat drinking her coffee in a green turban, with a dark wet curl stamped on each cheek.Jose, the butterfly, always came down in a silk petticoat and a kimono jacket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“劳拉，非得你去不可，你有艺术眼光。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ll have to go, Laura; you’re the artistic one.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉飞奔着跑开，手里还拿着她那块黄油面包。能有个借口在户外吃东西是如此怡人，另外，她又爱管事，她总觉得自己能比别人安排得好。</td>
		<td class="en">Away Laura flew, still holding her piece of bread-and-butter.It’s so delicious to have an excuse for eating out of doors, and besides, she loved having to arrange things; she always felt she could do it so much better than anybody else.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >四个穿着衬衫的人站在花园的小路上，聚在一起。他们拿着卷着帆布的木架子，背着大工具袋。他们看上去很让人敬畏。劳拉现在希望自己没有拿黄油面包，没有地方搁，而且她又不能把它扔掉。当她走近他们时，她的脸变得绯红，但是她努力表现得一脸严肃，甚至还装作有点近视。</td>
		<td class="en">Four men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden path.They carried staves covered with rolls of canvas, and they had big tool-bags slung on their backs.They looked impressive.Laura wished now that she had not got the bread-and-butter, but there was nowhere to put it, and she couldn’t possibly throw it away.She blushed and tried to look severe and even a little bit short-sighted as she came up to them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好。”她模仿着她母亲的语气说。但是那听起来却很做作，她觉得很丢人，然后她像个小女孩似的结结巴巴地说：“哦——呃——你们来——是为搭帐篷的事吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good morning,” she said, copying her mother’s voice.But that sounded so fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a little girl, “Oh—er—have you come—is it about the marquee?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，小姐。”一个个头最高、满脸雀斑的瘦高小伙子说，他移动一下工具袋，把草帽推到脑后，向下朝她笑了笑，“就是来搭帐篷的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s right, miss,” said the tallest of the men, a lanky, freckled fellow, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked back his straw hat and smiled down at her.“That’s about it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他那随和而友好的微笑使劳拉恢复了常态。他的眼睛十分可爱，不大，但却是那样地深蓝！于是她又看看其他几个人，他们也都在微笑。“高兴点儿，我们不会咬人的。”他们的微笑似乎在说。工人们多么可爱！这又是多么美好的一个早晨啊！她不该提及早晨的，她得有个办事的样子。忙那帐篷的事吧。</td>
		<td class="en">His smile was so easy, so friendly that Laura recovered.What nice eyes he had, small, but such a dark blue!And now she looked at the others, they were smiling too.“Cheer up, we won’t bite,” their smile seemed to say.How very nice workmen were!And what a beautiful morning!She mustn’t mention the morning; she must be business-like.The marquee.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，搭在百合花圃那边怎么样？可以么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, what about the lily-lawn?Would that do?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她用那只没有拿黄油面包的手指着百合花圃。他们转过来，盯着那个方向看。一个矮胖子努了努下唇，那个高个子皱了皱眉头。</td>
		<td class="en">And she pointed to the lily-lawn with the hand that didn’t hold the bread-and-butter.They turned, they stared in the direction.A little fat chap thrust out his under-lip, and the tall fellow frowned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不这样认为，”他说，“不够显眼。你看，像帐篷这类东西，”他很自然地转向劳拉，“要是你明白我的意思的话，你就会想把它搭在这样的一个地方，看见它，就像是你的眼睛被猛打了一拳似的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t fancy it,” said he.“Not conspicuous enough.You see, with a thing like a marquee,” and he turned to Laura in his easy way, “you want to put it somewhere where it’ll give you a bang slap in the eye, if you follow me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉从小的教养让她迟疑了一会儿，一个工人对她说什么往眼睛上砰地猛打一拳，这是不是够尊重？可是她确实能明白他的意思。</td>
		<td class="en">Laura’s upbringing made her wonder for a moment whether it was quite respectful of a workman to talk to her of bangs slap in the eye.But she did quite follow him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“搭在网球场的一角吧，”她建议说，“不过乐队要占一个角的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A corner of the tennis-court,” she suggested.“But the band’s going to be in one corner.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，还会有乐队，是吗？”另一个工人说。他脸色苍白。当他深色的眼睛打量着网球场的时候，他的面容看上去很憔悴。他在想什么？</td>
		<td class="en">“H’m, going to have a band, are you?” said another of the workmen.He was pale.He had a haggard look as his dark eyes scanned the tennis-court.What was he thinking?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“只是个小乐队而已。”劳拉温和地说。即使乐队非常小，他或许也不会太介意。但是高个子打岔说道：“小姐，你看，那儿才是个地方。那些树前面，在那边，搭那儿会很好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Only a very small band,” said Laura gently.Perhaps he wouldn’t mind so much if the band was quite small.But the tall fellow interrupted.“Look here, miss, that’s the place.Against those trees. Over there. That’ll do fine.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在卡拉卡树前面。这样一来，卡拉卡树就会被遮住。那些树十分可爱，叶子宽大而闪闪发亮，树上还结有一串串黄色的果实。它们就像是你想象中的生长在荒岛上的树一样，骄傲，孤独，在沉寂的辉煌里把自己的树叶和果实举向太阳。它们非得被帐篷遮住吗？</td>
		<td class="en">Against the karakas.Then the karaka-trees would be hidden.And they were so lovely, with their broad, gleaming leaves, and their clusters of yellow fruit.They were like trees you imagined growing on a desert island, proud, solitary, lifting their leaves and fruits to the sun in a kind of silent splendour.Must they be hidden by a marquee?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它们就得被遮住。工人们已经扛着木架子朝那边走过去了。只有高个子留在后面。他俯身去捏一根薰衣草小枝，然后把拇指和食指放在鼻尖旁，闻了闻手指上的香气。劳拉看见那手势动作，就忘了关于卡拉卡树的所有事情。让她感到惊奇的是，他居然会喜欢这些东西——喜欢薰衣草的味道。她认识的人当中有几个人会这样做？啊，工人们真是出奇地可爱，她想。为什么她不能有工人朋友呢？她的朋友只是那些和她一起跳舞、星期天晚上来吃晚饭的傻头傻脑的青年们。她会和这样的人相处得更好。</td>
		<td class="en">They must.Already the men had shouldered their staves and were making for the place.Only the tall fellow was left.He bent down, pinched a sprig of lavender, put his thumb and forefinger to his nose and snuffed up the smell.When Laura saw that gesture she forgot all about the karakas in her wonder at him caring for things like that—caring for the smell of lavender.How many men that she knew would have done such a thing?Oh, how extraordinarily nice workmen were, she thought.Why couldn’t she have workmen for her friends rather than the silly boys she danced with and who came to Sunday night supper?She would get on much better with men like these.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当高个子在一个信封背面画着什么，某个像是被卷起来或是要留着挂起来的什么东西时，她认定一切都错在那荒谬的阶级差别上。就她个人而言，她可没感觉到这种差别。一点儿也没有，一丝一毫都没有……这时传来了木锤敲打的嘭嘭声。有人吹口哨，有人唱起歌来：“你就在那儿吗，伙伴儿？”“伙伴儿！”歌中包含着友谊——那友谊——那友谊——只为了证明她有多高兴，让高个子看看她有多随意自在，看看她是多么地蔑视愚蠢的习俗。劳拉盯着那张小小的画，大大地咬了口黄油面包。她觉得自己就像个女工。</td>
		<td class="en">It’s all the fault, she decided, as the tall fellow drew something on the back of an envelope, something that was to be looped up or left to hang, of these absurd class distinctions.Well, for her part, she didn’t feel them.Not a bit, not an atom... And now there came the chock-chock of wooden hammers.Some one whistled, some one sang out, “Are you right there, matey?”“Matey!”The friendliness of it, the—the—Just to prove how happy she was, just to show the tall fellow how at home she felt, and how she despised stupid conventions, Laura took a big bite of her bread-and-butter as she stared at the little drawing.She felt just like a work-girl.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“劳拉，劳拉，你在哪儿？电话，劳拉！”声音从房子里传出来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Laura, Laura, where are you?Telephone, Laura!”a voice cried from the house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来啦！”她飞快地跑开了，掠过草坪，上了小路，登上台阶，穿过阳台，然后进了门廊。门厅里，她的父亲和劳里正在刷帽子，准备去上班。</td>
		<td class="en">“Coming!”Away she skimmed, over the lawn, up the path, up the steps, across the veranda, and into the porch.In the hall her father and Laurie were brushing their hats ready to go to the office.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我说，劳拉，”劳里非常快速地说，“今天下午之前，你可以看看我的上衣吗？看是不是需要熨一下。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I say, Laura,” said Laurie very fast, “you might just give a squiz at my coat before this afternoon.See if it wants pressing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧。”她说。突然间她阻止不了自己。她跑向劳里，给了他一个轻而短暂的拥抱。“啊，我真爱宴会，你呢？”劳拉喘着气说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I will,” said she.Suddenly she couldn’t stop herself.She ran at Laurie and gave him a small, quick squeeze.“Oh, I do love parties, don’t you?” gasped Laura.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还可以，”劳里温和又孩子气地说，他也拥抱了一下妹妹，然后把她轻轻一推，“赶紧去接电话吧，傻姑娘。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rather,” said Laurie’s warm, boyish voice, and he squeezed his sister too, and gave her a gentle push.“Dash off to the telephone, old girl.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >电话。“是的，是的，噢，是的。基蒂吗？亲爱的，早上好。来吃午饭？一定要来，亲爱的。当然高兴。午餐会很简单——只有些三明治酥皮和碎的蛋白甜皮饼，还有些剩的什么东西。对啊，真是个好得不能再好的早晨，是吧？你的白衣服？啊，我当然应该了。等一下，别挂断。母亲在叫。”劳拉向后靠了靠，“什么？母亲？听不见。”</td>
		<td class="en">The telephone.“Yes, yes; oh yes.Kitty?Good morning, dear.Come to lunch?Do, dear.Delighted of course.It will only be a very scratch meal—just the sandwich crusts and broken meringue-shells and what’s left over.Yes, isn’t it a perfect morning?Your white?Oh, I certainly should.One moment—hold the line.Mother’s calling.”And Laura sat back.“What, mother?Can’t hear.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从楼梯上飘下来谢里登太太的声音。“告诉她要戴上上个星期天她戴的那顶可爱的帽子。”</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Sheridan’s voice floated down the stairs.“Tell her to wear that sweet hat she had on last Sunday.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“母亲说让你戴上上个星期天你戴的那顶可爱的帽子。好。一点钟。拜拜。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mother says you’re to wear that sweet hat you had on last Sunday.Good.One o’clock.Bye-bye.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉把话筒放回原处，双臂举过头顶，深深地吸了口气，她把手臂张开又放下。“唉。”她叹了口气，随即坐了起来。她静静地听着。房子里所有的门好像都开着。轻捷的脚步声和四处的说话声让这个房子充满了生气。通往厨房一带的包着绿呢桌布的门开了又关上了，发出了低沉的声音。这时传来一阵刺耳的咯咯声。那是在推笨重的钢琴时，下面的小硬轮子发出的声音。不过，空气真好！要是你停下来注意的话，空气是否总是像这样呢？轻风在追逐打闹，从窗顶进来，又从门口出去。两处小小的光点也在嬉戏打闹，一处在墨水瓶上，一处在银相框上。可爱的小小光点。尤其是墨水瓶盖上的那一处。它是相当温暖。一颗温暖的小银星。她几乎想去吻它。</td>
		<td class="en">Laura put back the receiver, flung her arms over her head, took a deep breath, stretched and let them fall.“Huh,” she sighed, and the moment after the sigh she sat up quickly.She was still, listening.All the doors in the house seemed to be open.The house was alive with soft, quick steps and running voices.The green baize door that led to the kitchen regions swung open and shut with a muffled thud.And now there came a long, chuckling absurd sound.It was the heavy piano being moved on its stiff castors.But the air!If you stopped to notice, was the air always like this?Little faint winds were playing chase, in at the tops of the windows, out at the doors.And there were two tiny spots of sun, one on the inkpot, one on a silver photograph frame, playing too.Darling little spots.Especially the one on the inkpot lid.It was quite warm.A warm little silver star.She could have kissed it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >前门铃响了，接着楼梯上传来赛迪的印花布裙发出的窸窣声。一个男人在低声说着什么。赛迪心不在焉地回答：“我真不知道。等一下。我去问问谢里登太太。”</td>
		<td class="en">The front door bell pealed, and there sounded the rustle of Sadie’s print skirt on the stairs.A man’s voice murmured; Sadie answered, careless, “I’m sure I don’t know.Wait.I’ll ask Mrs Sheridan.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么事，赛迪？”劳拉走进门厅。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is it, Sadie?”Laura came into the hall.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是花店的人，劳拉小姐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s the florist, Miss Laura.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >确实是花店的人。进门处就放着一个上面摆满粉红色盆栽百合的宽浅盘。没有其他花种。只有百合——美人蕉百合，正在盛开。那光彩夺目的粉红色大花朵在光润的深红色根茎上所表现出来的生气几乎是咄咄逼人。</td>
		<td class="en">It was, indeed.There, just inside the door, stood a wide, shallow tray full of pots of pink lilies.No other kind.Nothing but lilies—canna lilies, big pink flowers, wide open, radiant, almost frighteningly alive on bright crimson stems.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，赛迪！”劳拉说，她像是在轻轻地呻吟。她蹲了下来，仿佛要用那百合的光焰来温暖自己。她感觉它们在她的手指里，在她的双唇上，在她的胸中生长。</td>
		<td class="en">“O-oh, Sadie!”said Laura, and the sound was like a little moan.She crouched down as if to warm herself at that blaze of lilies; she felt they were in her fingers, on her lips, growing in her breast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“弄错了吧，”她不确定地说，“没有人订过这么多。赛迪，去请母亲来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s some mistake,” she said faintly.“Nobody ever ordered so many.Sadie, go and find mother.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是谢里登太太正好在这个时候来了。</td>
		<td class="en">But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，”她平静地说，“对的，那些花是我订的。难道它们不可爱吗？”她按了按劳拉的手臂，“昨天我路过花店，看见这些花放在橱窗里。然后我就突然想，一辈子也就这么一回，就让我拥有足够多的美人蕉百合吧。这花园茶会倒是个不错的借口。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s quite right,” she said calmly.“Yes, I ordered them.Aren’t they lovely?”She pressed Laura’s arm.“I was passing the shop yesterday, and I saw them in the window.And I suddenly thought for once in my life I shall have enough canna lilies.The garden-party will be a good excuse.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是我在想，你不是说过你不想干预的嘛。”劳拉说。赛迪已经走开了。花店的人仍在外边的运货车旁。她搂住母亲的脖子，然后轻轻地，很轻地咬母亲的耳朵。</td>
		<td class="en">“But I thought you said you didn’t mean to interfere,” said Laura.Sadie had gone.The florist’s man was still outside at his van.She put her arm round her mother’s neck and gently, very gently, she bit her mother’s ear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“宝贝，你不会喜欢一个说什么就是什么的母亲吧，对吧？别这样。送花的人在这儿呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My darling child, you wouldn’t like a logical mother, would you?Don’t do that.Here’s the man.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他仍然在往里搬更多的百合，又搬了另一满盘。</td>
		<td class="en">He carried more lilies still, another whole tray.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请把花摆好，就放在一进门的门廊两边，”谢里登太太说，“同意吗，劳拉？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Bank them up, just inside the door, on both sides of the porch, please,” said Mrs. Sheridan.“Don’t you agree, Laura?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，棒极了，母亲。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I do, mother.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在客厅里，梅格、乔斯和矮个子的好汉斯终于把钢琴搬好了。</td>
		<td class="en">In the drawing-room Meg, Jose and good little Hans had at last succeeded in moving the piano.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，要是我们把这个长椅靠墙放着，然后把屋子里的所有东西都搬出去，只留下椅子，你们觉得怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, if we put this chesterfield against the wall and move everything out of the room except the chairs, don’t you think?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不错。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Quite.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“汉斯，把这些桌子都搬到吸烟室去，然后拿个扫帚把地毯上的痕迹扫掉——等等，汉斯——”乔斯爱向仆人发号施令，而他们也乐于听命于她。她总是使他们觉得自己在演戏，“告诉母亲和劳拉小姐马上到这儿来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hans, move these tables into the smoking-room, and bring a sweeper to take these marks off the carpet and—one moment, Hans—” Jose loved giving orders to the servants, and they loved obeying her.She always made them feel they were taking part in some drama.“Tell mother and Miss Laura to come here at once.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好的，乔斯小姐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Very good, Miss Jose.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她转向梅格。“我想听听钢琴的音正不正，万一今天下午有人让我唱歌怎么办。我们来试一试《烦闷的生活》吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">She turned to Meg.“I want to hear what the piano sounds like, just in case I’m asked to sing this afternoon.Let’s try over ‘This life is Weary.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >砰！嗒—嗒—嗒—嘀—嗒！钢琴的声音突然激昂地响起来，乔斯的脸色都变了。她紧握双手。当母亲和劳拉走进来的时候，她忧郁而又神秘地看了她们一眼。</td>
		<td class="en">Pom!Ta-ta-ta Tee-ta!The piano burst out so passionately that Jose’s face changed.She clasped her hands.She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不，还是别向孩子灌输这些观念的好！“没什么！去吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">No, better not put such ideas into the child’s head!“Nothing!Run along.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉关上花园门的时候，天色正暗下来。一条大狗像个影子似的从旁边跑过。道路白晃晃的，而下面洼地上的小房子却罩在深深的阴影之中。下午过后，一切都显得那么寂静！她走下山坡要到一个有人躺着死去了的地方，而她是不可能意识到这一点的。她为什么不能呢？她停了一分钟。现在，她似乎被那些亲吻、笑语和汤匙叮当的声音以及还有那踩过的草地的气味给塞得满满的。她再也装不下别的什么东西了。多奇怪！她抬头看看暗淡的天空，心里只想着一件事，“是的，这可是最成功的一次茶会。”</td>
		<td class="en">It was just growing dusky as Laura shut their garden gates.A big dog ran by like a shadow.The road gleamed white, and down below in the hollow the little cottages were in deep shade.How quiet it seemed after the afternoon.Here she was going down the hill to somewhere where a man lay dead, and she couldn’t realize it.Why couldn’t she?She stopped a minute.And it seemed to her that kisses, voices, tinkling spoons, laughter, the smell of crushed grass were somehow inside her.She had no room for anything else.How strange!She looked up at the pale sky, and all she thought was, “Yes, it was the most successful party.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在她穿过了那条宽阔的马路。她拐进了那烟熏火燎、又黑又暗的胡同里。裹着肩巾、戴着男式粗花呢帽子的女人匆忙走过。男人们靠在围篱上，孩子们则在门口玩耍。低哑的嗡嗡声从那些粗陋的小房子里传出来。有的屋里闪着光亮，螃蟹般身影的人从窗子那里横移过去。劳拉低下头疾步向前走着。她真希望自己现在穿着外套。她的衣服多耀眼啊！还有那饰有丝绒飘带的大帽子——要是她戴的是另一顶帽子就好了！人们在看她吗？他们一定在看她。来这里就是个错误，她一直就知道不该来的。甚至到了现在，她是不是也该回去？</td>
		<td class="en">Now the broad road was crossed.The lane began, smoky and dark.Women in shawls and men’s tweed caps hurried by.Men hung over the palings; the children played in the doorways.A low hum came from the mean little cottages.In some of them there was a flicker of light, and a shadow, crab-like, moved across the window.Laura bent her head and hurried on.She wished now she had put on a coat.How her frock shone!And the big hat with the velvet streamer—if only it was another hat!Were the people looking at her?They must be.It was a mistake to have come; she knew all along it was a mistake.Should she go back even now?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不行，太晚了。这就是那个人家了。一定是的。黑压压的一群人在屋外站着。一个上了年纪的老妇人坐在门旁的椅子上，手里撑着拐杖，两眼观望着。她脚下垫着报纸。劳拉走近时，嘈杂声停了下来。人们让开路。那些人仿佛都在等她，而且他们似乎已经知道她要来。</td>
		<td class="en">No, too late.This was the house.It must be.A dark knot of people stood outside.Beside the gate an old, old woman with a crutch sat in a chair, watching.She had her feet on a newspaper.The voices stopped as Laura drew near.The group parted.It was as though she was expected, as though they had known she was coming here.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉极其紧张。她把丝绒飘带甩向肩后，然后问站在旁边的一个女人：“这是斯科特太太家吗？”那女人很怪异地笑了笑，说：“是的，姑娘。”</td>
		<td class="en">Laura was terribly nervous.Tossing the velvet ribbon over her shoulder, she said to a woman standing by, “Is this Mrs. Scott’s house?”and the woman, smiling queerly, said, “It is, my lass.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >啊，远远离开这里吧！当她走上小径去敲门时，她真的是在说：“上帝啊，帮帮我吧！”远离这些盯着看的眼睛，或者是用什么把自己遮盖起来，哪怕是用那些女人的肩巾也行。我决定留下篮子就走。我甚至都不等把篮子腾空。</td>
		<td class="en">Oh, to be away from this!She actually said, “Help me, God,” as she walked up the tiny path and knocked.To be away from those staring eyes, or to be covered up in anything, one of those women’s shawls even.I’ll just leave the basket and go, she decided.I shan’t even wait for it to be emptied.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着门开了。一个身材矮小的黑衣女人出现在昏暗中。</td>
		<td class="en">Then the door opened.A little woman in black showed in the gloom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉说：“你是斯科特太太吗？”可是让她感到恐惧的是那女人回答说：“小姐，请进来。”于是她就给关在了过道里。</td>
		<td class="en">Laura said, “Are you Mrs. Scott?”But to her horror the woman answered, “Walk in please, miss,” and she was shut in the passage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不了，”劳拉说，“我不进去了。我来只是送这个篮子。母亲叫我——”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” said Laura, “I don’t want to come in.I only want to leave this basket.Mother sent—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在昏暗的过道里，那个矮小的女人似乎没有听见她说的话。“小姐，请走这边。”她用一种讨好的语气说，劳拉跟在她的身后。</td>
		<td class="en">The little woman in the gloomy passage seemed not to have heard her.“Step this way, please, miss,” she said in an oily voice, and Laura followed her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她发现自己进了一个破旧、窄小、低矮的厨房，里面点着一盏冒烟的灯。火前面坐着一个女人。</td>
		<td class="en">She found herself in a wretched little low kitchen, lighted by a smoky lamp.There was a woman sitting before the fire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“伊姆，”领她进来的小女人说，“伊姆！是一位年轻的姑娘。”她转向劳拉。她饱含深意地说：“小姐，我是她妹妹。您不会介意她的，对吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Em,” said the little creature who had let her in.“Em!It’s a young lady.”She turned to Laura.She said meaningly, “I’m ’er sister, miss.You’ll excuse ’er, won’t you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，那当然不会的！”劳拉说，“千万，千万不要打扰她。我——我只是想留下——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, but of course!” said Laura.“Please, please don’t disturb her.I—I only want to leave—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但这时坐在火边的那个女人转过头来。她的脸浮肿红胀，眼睛和嘴唇都肿得厉害，看上去很吓人。她似乎不能理解为什么劳拉会在那里。这是什么意思？为什么这个陌生人拿着篮子站在厨房里？这都是些什么事情？那可怜的面孔又皱了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">But at that moment the woman at the fire turned round.Her face, puffed up, red, with swollen eyes and swollen lips, looked terrible.She seemed as though she couldn’t understand why Laura was there.What did it mean?Why was this stranger standing in the kitchen with a basket?What was it all about?And the poor face puckered up again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，亲爱的，”另一个说，“我来答谢这位小姐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“All right, my dear,” said the other.“I’ll thenk the young lady.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她又说，“小姐，我肯定，您会担待她的。”她那张同样也肿着的脸勉强挤出了一个讨好的笑容。</td>
		<td class="en">And again she began, “You’ll excuse her, miss, I’m sure,” and her face, swollen too, tried an oily smile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉只想出去，然后走得远远的。她又回到过道里。一扇门开着。她径直走进了卧室，结果发现死去的那个人躺在那里。</td>
		<td class="en">Laura only wanted to get out, to get away.She was back in the passage.The door opened.She walked straight through into the bedroom, where the dead man was lying.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您想看看他，是吗？”伊姆的妹妹说着，身子擦过劳拉走到床边。“姑娘，不用害怕。”现在她说话的语气中略带着些亲热而调侃的意味，她亲昵地揭下被单——“他看上去还挺有样儿的。没什么可看的。亲爱的，过来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You’d like a look at ’im, wouldn’t you?”said Em’s sister, and she brushed past Laura over to the bed.“Don’t be afraid, my lass,”—and now her voice sounded fond and sly, and fondly she drew down the sheet—” ’e looks a picture.There’s nothing to show.Come along, my dear.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >劳拉走上前去。</td>
		<td class="en">Laura came.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个年轻人躺在那里酣睡。他睡得是那么深那么沉，以致远远地离开了她们两个。啊，那样地遥远，那样地安详。他是在睡梦中。永远别再叫醒他。他的头埋在枕头里，双眼合拢，在那闭着的眼皮之下，两眼什么都看不到。他把自己交给了梦。那些花园茶会、食物篮子以及那花边衣服又跟他有什么关系呢？他离这一切太远了。他美丽而又不可思议。她们欢笑着，音乐飘扬，此时，这个奇迹来到了这个胡同里。幸福……幸福……一切都很棒，他那张熟睡的面孔在说。本来就该如此。我很满意。</td>
		<td class="en">There lay a young man, fast asleep—sleeping so soundly, so deeply, that he was far, far away from them both.Oh, so remote, so peaceful.He was dreaming.Never wake him up again.His head was sunk in the pillow, his eyes were closed; they were blind under the closed eyelids.He was given up to his dream.What did garden-parties and baskets and lace frocks matter to him?He was far from all those things.He was wonderful, beautiful.While they were laughing and while the band was playing, this marvel had come to the lane.Happy... happy... All is well, said that sleeping face.This is just as it should be.I am content.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是不管怎么说，你还是得哭哭。而且她也不能不对他说话就走出房间。劳拉发出一大声孩子似的抽噎声。</td>
		<td class="en">But all the same you had to cry, and she couldn’t go out of the room without saying something to him.Laura gave a loud childish sob.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“原谅我戴着这样的帽子。”她说。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这次她并没有等伊姆的妹妹。她找到门，沿着小径走，走过黑压压的人群。在胡同拐角处她遇上了劳里。</td>
		<td class="en">And this time she didn’t wait for Em’s sister.She found her way out of the door, down the path, past all those dark people.At the corner of the lane she met Laurie.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“No,” sobbed Laura.“It was simply marvellous.But Laurie—” She stopped, she looked at her brother.“Isn’t life,” she stammered, “isn’t life—” But what life was she couldn’t explain.No matter.He quite understood.</td></tr>
