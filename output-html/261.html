		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有这样两个女孩子，人们只知道她们一个姓班福德，一个姓马奇。她们一起租了个农场，打算自己来打理所有的事情。就是说，她们要养鸡，靠着这些家禽维持生计。除此之外，还要养一头奶牛和一两头小牛。不幸的是，事情进展得并不顺利。</td>
		<td class="en">The two girls were usually known by their surnames, Banford and March.They had taken the farm together, intending to work it all by themselves: that is, they were going to rear chickens, make a living by poultry, and add to this by keeping a cow, and raising one or two young beasts.Unfortunately, things did not turn out well.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >班福德戴着一副眼镜，身材娇小，弱不禁风。不过她却是农场的主要投资人，因为马奇几乎没什么钱。班福德的父亲是伊斯灵顿镇的一个商人。他之所以帮助女儿开创事业，是为了她的健康着想，也是因为他疼爱自己的女儿，还有就是他觉得女儿看起来是不会结婚的。相比之下，马奇则要健壮一些。她曾在伊斯灵顿镇的夜校学习过粗细木工手艺。她在农场里充当着男人的角色。一开始时，还有班福德年老的祖父跟她们一起生活。他以前是个农场主。但不幸的是，老人在贝利农场生活了一年后便去世了。这样，就只剩下两个姑娘了。</td>
		<td class="en">Banford was a small, thin, delicate thing with spectacles.She, however, was the principal investor, for March had little or no money.Banford’s father, who was a tradesman in Islington, gave his daughter the start, for her health’s sake, and because he loved her, and because it did not look as if she would marry.March was more robust.She had learned carpentry and joinery at the evening classes in Islington.She would be the man about the place.They had, moreover, Banford’s old grandfather living with them at the start.He had been a farmer.But unfortunately the old man died after he had been at Bailey Farm for a year.Then the two girls were left alone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们都已不再年轻。事实上，两个人都快三十岁了。但当然也不算老。她们大胆地开始了自己的事业。她俩养了许多种鸡，其中有黑来航鸡、白来航鸡、普利茅斯鸡和怀恩多特鸡，还养了一些鸭子，在牧场里还养了两头小母牛。然而不幸的是，一头小母牛坚决拒绝呆在贝利农场的地界里。不管马奇怎样修补栅栏，那头小母牛还是会闯出去，在林子里逍遥自在地玩耍，或者私自闯进邻居的牧场。马奇和班福德只好追着它飞跑，但结果往往是白费力气。所以，她们只好绝望地卖掉了这头小母牛。后来，就在另一头小母牛初次产犊之前，老爷爷过世了。两位姑娘害怕为它接生，便匆忙把那头小母牛也给卖了，从此专注于照顾那些鸡和鸭。</td>
		<td class="en">They were neither of them young: that is, they were near thirty.But they certainly were not old.They set out quite gallantly with their enterprise.They had numbers of chickens, black Leghorns and white Leghorns, Plymouths and Wyandottes; also some ducks; also two heifers in the fields.One heifer, unfortunately, refused absolutely to stay in the Bailey Farm closes.No matter how March made up the fences, the heifer was out, wild in the woods, or trespassing on the neighbouring pasture, and March and Banford were away, flying after her, with more haste than success.So this heifer they sold in despair.Then, just before the other beast was expecting her first calf, the old man died, and the girls, afraid of the coming event, sold her in a panic, and limited their attentions to fowls and ducks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管她们有些懊悔，但再也不用照顾母牛了，所以还是松了口气。日子可不能一直都在辛苦劳作中度过。两个姑娘对于这点都很赞同。那些鸡鸭已经给她们带来了足够多的麻烦。马奇在敞棚的尽头搭建起了她的木工工作台。她在这里干活，动手制作笼子、门以及其他小物件。所有的鸡鸭都养在一间更大的屋子里，过去那里曾被用作谷仓和牛棚。它们有一个这么美丽的家，应该感到十分满意了。确实，它们看上去非常好。不过，让两位姑娘感到头疼的是，那些鸡鸭时不时会染上怪病，而且它们对生活的要求也十分苛刻，甚至还固执地拒绝产蛋。</td>
		<td class="en">In spite of a little chagrin, it was a relief to have no more cattle on hand.Life was not made merely to be slaved away.Both girls agreed in this.The fowls were quite enough trouble.March had set up her carpenter’s bench at the end of the open shed.Here she worked, making coops and doors and other appurtenances.The fowls were housed in the bigger building, which had served as barn and cow-shed in old days.They had a beautiful home, and should have been perfectly content.Indeed, they looked well enough.But the girls were disgusted at their tendency to strange illnesses, at their exacting way of life, and at their refusal, obstinate refusal to lay eggs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马奇负责绝大部分的户外工作。她在户外干活时，总是打着绑腿，穿着马裤和束了腰带的外套，头戴一顶宽松的帽子。她看起来几乎就像一位气质优雅、个性随意的年轻男子：肩膀挺得直直的，举止从容且自信满满，甚至还带着些许漠然或嘲讽的味道。但是她的脸却一点都不像男人的脸。她弯腰时，那缕缕深色卷发便在眼前飞舞起来。她的眼睛又大又黑。当她直起身子再次抬起头往上望时，眼睛里立刻又充满不安、惊异、羞涩和嘲讽。她的嘴唇似乎也总是因为痛苦和嘲讽而紧紧抿着。她的身上有种古怪而又难以解释的气质。她常常以一只脚为重心支撑站着，看着农场的鸡鸭在倾斜的院子里那让人讨厌的烂泥地中啪嗒啪嗒地四处乱走；她还会大声喊她最喜欢的那只白母鸡，而那母鸡听到有人喊自己的名字也会应声跑来。但是当马奇看着这群三趾鸡鸭在她的注视下摇摇摆摆跑来跑去的时候，她那又大又黑的眼睛里便会闪过一丝几乎是嘲讽的神色。她与最喜欢的母鸡帕蒂说话时，语气里也同样带着这种略带危险的嘲讽，而这时帕蒂会轻啄玛奇的靴子，以示友好。</td>
		<td class="en">March did most of the outdoor work.When she was out and about, in her puttees and breeches, her belted coat and her loose cap, she looked almost like some graceful, loose-balanced young man, for her shoulders were straight, and her movements easy and confident, even tinged with a little indifference or irony.But her face was not a man’s face, ever.The wisps of her crisp dark hair blew about her as she stooped, her eyes were big and wide and dark, when she looked up again, strange, startled, shy and sardonic at once.Her mouth, too, was almost pinched as if in pain and irony.There was something odd and unexplained about her.She would stand balanced on one hip, looking at the fowls pattering about in the obnoxious fine mud of the sloping yard, and calling to her favourite white hen, which came in answer to her name.But there was an almost satirical flicker in March’s big, dark eyes as she looked at her three-toed flock pattering about under her gaze, and the same slight dangerous satire in her voice as she spoke to the favoured Patty, who pecked at March’s boot by way of friendly demonstration.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >贝利农场的鸡鸭并没有茁壮成长，尽管马奇在它们身上费尽了心思。按照惯例，马奇清晨给它们喂热饲料，她注意到那些鸡鸭在吃完饲料后的几个小时里行动笨拙，昏昏欲睡。她已预料到会看见它们全都倚着屋棚的柱子，懒洋洋地消化食物。而她很清楚地知道，那些鸡应该正忙着四处又挖又扒地觅食的，这样才有助于它们的健康。所以她决定晚上给它们喂热饲料，好让它们吃完后就去睡觉。她这么做了。但是却没有任何改变。</td>
		<td class="en">Fowls did not flourish at Bailey Farm, in spite of all that March did for them.When she provided hot food for them in the morning, according to the rule, she noticed that it made them heavy and dozy for hours.She expected to see them lean against the pillars of the shed in their languid processes of digestion.And she knew quite well that they ought to be busily scratching and foraging about, if they were to come to any good.So she decided to give them their hot food at night, and let them sleep on it.Which she did.But it made no difference.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >战乱时局是不利于饲养家禽的。饲料稀缺，质量又不好。《夏令时法案》通过后，到了夏日晚上九点，那些鸡鸭都顽固地拒绝像往常一样回窝睡觉。九点钟确实已经够晚的了，除非把它们关进窝里睡觉，不然休想有一丝安宁。现在它们兴高采烈地逛来逛去，根本看都不看一眼谷仓，一直逛到十点钟甚至更晚。班福德和马奇都不认为活着纯粹是为了工作。她们想在晚上读读书，或者骑车四处逛逛。也许马奇还想在以绿色为背景的瓷器上用曲线勾画出几只天鹅，又或者是精心地干点细木工活，做一个精美的炉栏。她头脑里充满了稀奇古怪的主意和未及实现的意向。但是所有这些事，她一件也做不成，都怪那些呆笨的鸡鸭。</td>
		<td class="en">War conditions, again, were very unfavourable to poultry-keeping.Food was scarce and bad.And when the Daylight Saving Bill was passed, the fowls obstinately refused to go to bed as usual, about nine o’clock in the summer-time.That was late enough, indeed, for there was no peace till they were shut up and asleep.Now they cheerfully walked around, without so much as glancing at the barn, until ten o’clock or later.Both Banford and March disbelieved in living for work alone.They wanted to read or take a cycle-ride in the evening, or perhaps March wished to paint curvilinear swans on porcelain, with green background, or else make a marvellous fire-screen by processes of elaborate cabinet work.For she was a creature of odd whims and unsatisfied tendencies.But from all these things she was prevented by the stupid fowls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而且还有件倒霉事比别的事情更让人头疼。贝利农场是个小农庄，有古老的木式谷仓和围有低矮山墙的农宅，离林子边缘只隔了一块田地。自从战争爆发以来，狐狸就成了祸害。它居然就在马奇和班福德的眼皮底下把母鸡给抓走了。每当又有母鸡咯咯叫着扑棱翅膀时，班福德都会惊跳起来，大眼镜后的眼睛瞪得大大的，盯着眼前的惨状。太迟了！又一只白来航鸡没了。这真让人沮丧。</td>
		<td class="en">One evil there was greater than any other.Bailey Farm was a little homestead, with ancient wooden barn and low-gabled farm-house, lying just one field removed from the edge of the wood.Since the war the fox was a demon.He carried off the hens under the very noses of March and Banford.Banford would startle and stare through her big spectacles with all her eyes, as another squawk and flutter took place at her heels.Too late!Another white Leghorn gone.It was disheartening.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们想尽了办法补救。在准许射杀狐狸之后，她们两个人就带着枪，在狐狸经常出没的时间守卫着鸡棚。但是一点用都没有。狐狸的动作实在是太快了。就这样，又一年过去了，接着又是一年。正如班福德说的那样，她们是靠亏损过活的。一年夏天，她们把农宅租了出去，自己转而住进了一间用废弃的火车车厢做成的屋子，就坐落在田野的一处角落。这让她们感到愉快，同时也能帮助她们度过经济难关。但情况还是不好。</td>
		<td class="en">They did what they could to remedy it.When it became permitted to shoot foxes, they stood sentinel with their guns, the two of them, at the favoured hours.But it was no good.The fox was too quick for them.So another year passed, and another, and they were living on their losses, as Banford said.They let their farm-house one summer, and retired to live in a railway carriage that was deposited as a sort of outhouse in a corner of the field.This amused them, and helped their finances.Nonetheless, things looked dark.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >班福德尽管有点神经质而且娇弱，但也是个热心大方的姑娘，而马奇虽然性格古怪又常常心不在焉，但她有某种奇特的宽宏气度，所以两人通常还是非常要好的朋友。但是在漫长的孤寂生活中，她们也渐渐开始闹点小矛盾，开始对彼此感到有点厌倦了。马奇承担了五分之四的工作，尽管她自己并不在意，然而日子总是这样，都没有喘口气的时候，她的眼里有时就会闪过奇怪的眼神。这时班福德会感到更加紧张，因而变得垂头丧气的，马奇跟她讲话的口气也变得尖锐了。时间一个月一个月地过去，不知怎的，她们似乎一直在损失，而且逐渐失去希望。她们孤独地生活在林子边缘的田野上。广袤的原野一直延伸到远处白马山圆形的山岭下，一派空旷迷茫。她们似乎只能过着只有两个人的日子。没有什么事情能让她们振奋起来——没有一丝希望。</td>
		<td class="en">Although they were usually the best of friends, because Banford, though nervous and delicate, was a warm, generous soul, and March, though so odd and absent in herself, had a strange magnanimity, yet, in the long solitude, they were apt to become a little irritable with one another, tired of one another.March had four-fifths of the work to do, and though she did not mind, there seemed no relief, and it made her eyes flash curiously sometimes.Then Banford, feeling more nerve-worn than ever, would become despondent, and March would speak sharply to her.They seemed to be losing ground, somehow, losing hope as the months went by.There alone in the fields by the wood, with the wide country stretching hollow and dim to the round hills of the White Horse, in the far distance, they seemed to have to live too much off themselves.There was nothing to keep them up—and no hope.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那只狐狸确实让她俩都非常恼火。夏日清晨，她们只要把鸡鸭放出笼去，就得马上拿起枪守卫着；暮色渐浓时，同样的事情还得再做一遍。这狐狸实在是太狡猾了。它在幽深的草丛中潜行，就如同蛇一样难以被人发现。而且它好像故意跟两位姑娘捉迷藏。有那么一两次，马奇已经瞥到了它那白色的尾巴尖，或是幽深草丛中它那红色的身影，她还朝它开了一枪。但是它根本不在乎这个。</td>
		<td class="en">The fox really exasperated them both.As soon as they had let the fowls out, in the early summer mornings, they had to take their guns and keep guard: and then again as soon as evening began to mellow, they must go once more.And he was so sly.He slid along in the deep grass; he was difficult as a serpent to see.And he seemed to circumvent the girls deliberately.Once or twice March had caught sight of the white tip of his brush, or the ruddy shadow of him in the deep grass, and she had let fire at him.But he made no account of this.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天傍晚，马奇背对夕阳站着，胳膊下夹着枪，头发紧压在帽子底下。她一边看守着，一边陷入沉思。她经常处于这种状态中。她的眼神专注敏锐，然而内心根本没有注意到眼前所见。她总是陷入这种奇怪的着迷状态，同时嘴巴紧拧着。她是否身在那里，或者她的意识到底在不在那里，都还是一个问题。</td>
		<td class="en">One evening March was standing with her back to the sunset, her gun under her arm, her hair pushed under her cap.She was half watching, half musing.It was her constant state.Her eyes were keen and observant, but her inner mind took no notice of what she saw.She was always lapsing into this odd, rapt state, her mouth rather screwed up.It was a question whether she was there, actually conscious present, or not.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >林子边缘的树木在充沛的阳光照射下呈现出微带黑棕色的青翠——因为那时已经是八月底了。远处，松树上那黄铜色的光滑树干和枝条在空中闪烁着光芒。近处，茂盛的草丛也沐浴在阳光里，那长长的褐色叶柄微微发亮。鸡鸭都在附近——鸭子仍在松树下的池塘里戏水。马奇看着这一切，也看到了这一切，却又什么也没看到。她听到班福德在远处正在跟鸡鸭们说着话，却又什么都没有听见。她到底在想什么呢？只有上帝才知道。她的意识似乎被控制了。</td>
		<td class="en">The trees on the wood-edge were a darkish, brownish green in the full light-for it was the end of August.Beyond, the naked, copper-like shafts and limbs of the pine trees shone in the air.Nearer the rough grass, with its long, brownish stalks all agleam, was full of light.The fowls were round about-the ducks were still swimming on the pond under the pine trees.March looked at it all, saw it all, and did not see it.She heard Banford speaking to the fowls in the distance-and she did not hear.What was she thinking about?Heaven knows.Her consciousness was, as it were, held back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她垂下眼帘，突然间，她看到了那只狐狸。它正抬起头来注视着她。它压低了下巴，双眼往上望。它的目光正好与马奇的相遇。它认识她。她仿佛中了魔咒一般怔住了——她知道它认识她。所以它才会深深地望进她的眼里，她的灵魂被吸引过去了。它认识她，它一点都不害怕。</td>
		<td class="en">She lowered her eyes, and suddenly saw the fox.He was looking up at her.His chin was pressed down, and his eyes were looking up.They met her eyes.And he knew her.She was spellbound-she knew he knew her.So he looked into her eyes, and her soul failed her.He knew her, he was not daunted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她挣扎着，困惑迷糊中，她还是清醒过来了，然后便看见它缓缓地跃过几根掉落在地上的树枝，从容而放肆地跳跃而去。然后，它又转过头来看了她一眼，便轻快地跑掉了。她看见它的尾巴直直地竖着，像一根羽毛那样光滑，白色的臀闪闪发光。然后它消失了，轻轻地，轻柔如风。</td>
		<td class="en">She struggled, confusedly she came to herself, and saw him making off, with slow leaps over some fallen boughs, slow, impudent jumps.Then he glanced over his shoulder, and ran smoothly away.She saw his brush held smooth like a feather, she saw his white buttocks twinkle.And he was gone, softly, soft as the wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她把枪举到肩膀上，但马上又撅起了嘴，心里明白这个时候做出开枪的样子已经无济于事了。于是，她循着它消失的方向，开始慢慢地跟在后面走，慢慢地而又不失坚定地走着。她希望能找到它。她下定决心要找到它。她并没考虑如果再次看到它，自己会怎样做。但不管怎样，她都下定决心要找到它。因此，她便在林子边上心不在焉地走着，黑眼睛睁得大大的，而且炯炯有神，脸上泛着淡淡的红晕。她什么也没想。她在一种奇怪的、无知觉的状态中四处走动着。</td>
		<td class="en">She put her gun to her shoulder, but even then pursed her mouth, knowing it was nonsense to pretend to fire.So she began to walk slowly after him, in the direction he had gone, slowly, pertinaciously.She expected to find him.In her heart she was determined to find him.What she would do when she saw him again she did not consider.But she was determined to find him.So she walked abstractedly about on the edge of the wood, with wide, vivid dark eyes, and a faint flush in her cheeks.She did not think.In strange mindlessness she walked hither and thither.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后，她终于意识到班福德在呼唤她。她努力集中注意力，转过身答应着，声音几乎像在尖叫。然后她就大步流星地往农庄走去。此时，一轮红日正在徐徐落下，鸡鸭也都开始回窝了。她望着它们，白色的、黑色的小家伙们，都纷纷往谷仓走去。她着了魔似地盯着它们，却又没有真正看到它们。但她还是本能地在该关门的时候把门关上了。</td>
		<td class="en">At last she became aware that Banford was calling her.She made an effort of attention, turned, and gave some sort of screaming call in answer.Then again she was striding off towards the homestead.The red sun was setting, the fowls were retiring towards their roost.She watched them, white creatures, black creatures, gathering to the barn.She watched them spellbound, without seeing them.But her automatic intelligence told her when it was time to shut the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她回到室内吃晚饭，班福德已经把饭桌摆好了。班福德轻松地聊着天。马奇似乎在听着，表情一如继往地冷漠、刚硬。她时不时会简单地回应几句。但从头至尾，她整个人像中了魔咒一般。吃完晚饭，她立刻起身走了出去，连句解释的话也没有。</td>
		<td class="en">She went indoors to supper, which Banford had set on the table.Banford chatted easily.March seemed to listen, in her distant, manly way.She answered a brief word now and then.But all the time she was as if spellbound.And as soon as supper was over, she rose again to go out, without saying why.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她再次拿起枪，出去找那只狐狸。因为它抬起眼睛看了她，那洞悉一切的眼神似乎读透了她的心思。她并不是总在想这只狐狸，实际上她已经完全被它迷住了。她看到它那乌黑、狡黠、从容不迫的眼睛深深望进她的心里，一眼就看透了她。她觉得它无形中已经掌控了她的灵魂。她知道它抬头看时会低下下巴，她还熟悉它那棕黄和灰白色的鼻子。又一次，她看见它转过头来注视着她，带着些许邀请的意味，又带着些许的轻蔑和狡黠。于是，她沿着林子边缘走着，惊恐的大眼睛闪着光，枪就紧夹在胳膊底下。此时，夜幕降临，一轮硕大的明月爬上了松树梢头。班福德又在叫她了。</td>
		<td class="en">She took her gun again and went to look for the fox.For he had lifted his eyes upon her, and his knowing look seemed to have entered her brain.She did not so much think of him: she was possessed by him.She saw his dark, shrewd, unabashed eye looking into her, knowing her.She felt him invisibly master her spirit.She knew the way he lowered his chin as he looked up, she knew his muzzle, the golden brown, and the greyish white.And again she saw him glance over his shoulder at her, half inviting, half contemptuous and cunning.So she went, with her great startled eyes glowing, her gun under her arm, along the wood edge.Meanwhile the night fell, and a great moon rose above the pine trees.And again Banford was calling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是她便回屋了。她沉默地忙活着。　她一边检查枪支，把它擦干净，一边在灯光下心不在焉地想着什么。然后她又走出去，站在硕大的月亮下面，看看是否一切正常。当她看见松树那深色的树冠映衬着血红色的天空时，又一次，她的心跳被那只狐狸拨乱了。她很想带着枪紧跟着它。</td>
		<td class="en">So she went indoors.She was silent and busy.She examined her gun, and cleaned it, musing abstractedly by the lamplight.Then she went out again, under the great moon, to see if everything was right.When she saw the dark crests of the pine trees against the blood-red sky, again her heart beat to the fox, the fox.She wanted to follow him, with her gun.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好几天之后，她才跟班福德提起这件事情。那是在一天晚上，她突然说道：“周六晚上，那只狐狸就在我脚边。”</td>
		<td class="en">It was some days before she mentioned the affair to Banford.Then suddenly one evening she said:‘The fox was right at my feet on Saturday night.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哪里？”班福德问，镜片后的眼睛瞪大了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Where?’ said Banford, her eyes opening behind her spectacles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就站在池塘边上的时候。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘When I stood just above the pond.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你开枪了吗？”班福德喊道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Did you fire?’ cried Banford.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有，我没开枪。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘No, I didn’t.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么不开枪？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why not?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎呀，我当时太吃惊了吧，我想。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why, I was too much surprised, I suppose.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是马奇惯常用的那种慢吞吞又简短的说话方式。班福德盯着她的朋友看了好一会儿。</td>
		<td class="en">It was the same old, slow, laconic way of speech March always had.Banford stared at her friend for a few moments.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你看见它了？”她喊道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You saw him?’ she cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，是的！它当时正抬头望着我，非常镇定呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh yes!He was looking up at me, cool as anything.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我跟你说，太放肆了！”班福德大叫道，“它们根本不怕我们，内利。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I tell you,’ cried Banford－‘the cheek!They’re not afraid of us, Nellie.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，是的。”马奇答道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, no,’ said March.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可惜你一枪都没有开。”班福德说道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Pity you didn’t get a shot at him,’ said Banford.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太可惜了！从那以后我就一直在找它。但是我想它不会再走得这么近了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Isn’t it a pity!I’ve been looking for him ever since.But I don’t suppose he’ll come so near again.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想它是不会了。”班福德答道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I don’t suppose he will,’ said Banford.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后她便忘记这事了。只是她比从前更恼怒了，因为那坏狐狸实在太放肆了。马奇也没有意识到自己会想起那只狐狸。但不管什么时候，无论是她陷入沉思时，又或是当她对于眼前所发生的事情半是入迷半是清醒时，不知怎的，那只狐狸都会主宰她的潜意识，占领她的另一半思绪。这样的情形持续了一周又一周，一月又一月。不管她是在爬树摘苹果，还是在打落剩下的李子；不管她是在鸭池挖沟，还是在清扫谷仓，当她干完这些活，或者站直身子，把前额上的几缕头发拨开，再古怪地撅起嘴——这动作对于她的年龄来说显得过于老气了——每当这时候，那狐狸身上的古老魔咒又开始对她的思绪施展魔力，如同当初它注视着她的时候一样。这时候，她好像总能闻见它的气味。而这种情况总在意想不到的时候一再出现。比如她晚上准备睡觉时，或者把水注入茶壶泡茶时，那狐狸的影象就又来了，就如一道魔符。</td>

		<td class="en">That night March dreamed vividly.She dreamed she heard a singing outside which she could not understand, a singing that roamed round the house, in the fields, and in the darkness.It moved her so that she felt she must weep.She went out, and suddenly she knew it was the fox singing.He was very yellow and bright, like corn.She went nearer to him, but he ran away and ceased singing.He seemed near, and she wanted to touch him.She stretched out her hand, but suddenly he bit her wrist, and at the same instant, as she drew back, the fox, turning round to bound away, whisked his brush across her face, and it seemed his brush was on fire, for it seared and burned her mouth with a great pain.She awoke with the pain of it, and lay trembling as if she were really seared.</td></tr>
