		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >和煦的春天——在我们期盼数周、渴望数月后——终于到来，唤醒我们老宅屋顶和墙上的青苔。她欢快地探进我书房的窗户，邀我将它打开，将她温暖的气息与火炉幽暗阴郁的抚慰混合，营造出一种夏日的气氛。随着窗扉向上开启，无数种思绪和幻想腾空飞入这无垠的空间，在这缓缓流逝的冬日里，在我幽居于这斗室的日子里，陪伴着我；这些幻想，或快乐，或怪诞，或悲伤；真实生活的画面染上了大自然朴素的灰色和赤褐色；梦境中的景象，装饰着彩虹的色彩，还没好好着色就消褪了，——这一切现在或许都已消逝不见，徒留我用阳光塑造新的生活。幽思拍打着忧郁的翅膀，如猫头鹰一般翱翔,在欢快的正午眨着眼睛。这样的伙伴倒是适合这个窗户玻璃上结着霜，炉火劈啪作响的季节。风从道旁的黑梣树中呼啸而过，飘飘扬扬的暴风雪堵塞了林间小路，铺满了石壁间的公路。春夏时节，所有阴郁的思绪都应该与阴郁多思的乌鸦一起随冬日北去。古老的、乐园般的生活模式又有了用武之地；我们活着，既不是为了思索，也不是为了劳作，而是为了快乐这一简单的目的；此刻，除了接受天国温暖的微笑，感受大地的复苏，再没什么值得人类发挥其无尽的能力了。</td>
		<td class="en">Balmy Spring—weeks later than we expected, and months later than we longed for her—comes at last, to revive the moss on the roof and walls of our old mansion.She peeps brightly into my study-window, inviting me to throw it open, and create a summer atmosphere by the intermixture of her genial breath with the black and cheerless comfort of the stove.As the casement ascends, forth into infinite space fly the innumerable forms of thought or fancy that have kept me company in the retirement of this little chamber, during the sluggish lapse of wintry weather;—visions, gay, grotesque, and sad; pictures of real life, tinted with nature's homely gray and russet; scenes in dream-land, bedizened with rainbow hues, which faded before they were well laid on;—all these may vanish now, and leave me to mould a fresh existence out of sunshine. Brooding Meditation may flap her dusky wings and take her owl-like flight, blinking amid the cheerfulness of noontide.Such companions befit the season of frosted window-panes and crackling fires, when the blast howls through the black ash-trees of our avenue, and the drifting snow-storm chokes up the wood-paths, and fills the highway from stone-wall to stone-wall.In the spring and summer time, all sombre thoughts should follow the winter northward, with the sombre and thoughtful crows.The old paradisiacal economy of life is again in force; we live, not to think, nor to labor, but for the simple end of being happy; nothing, for the present hour, is worthy of man's infinite capacity, save to imbibe the warm smile of heaven, and sympathize with the reviving earth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时的春天愈加步履匆匆地走来，因为冬日无意间盘桓了太长时间，春天得尽最大努力才能勉强收复一半该她统御的时间。仅仅两周前，我还站在涨水的河边看历经四个寒冷月份结成的冰块顺流而下。除去山坡上随处可见的一些狭长地带，目之所及到处都覆盖着厚厚的积雪，最底层的雪还是十二月初的暴雪留下的。这一景致让目睹者惊呆，无法想象怎样能用比雪铺展开来更短的时间将这块巨大的白布从这僵尸般的世界表面移走。然而，谁又能估量潜移默化的影响在物质废墟或人类心灵的道德冬天所产生的力量呢！没有暴风雨——连闷热的天气也没有——却总有一缕南风的气息，时而有一日宜人的阳光，时而是同样宜人的薄雾或轻轻飘落的似乎浸润着微笑和祝福的阵雨。积雪仿佛被魔法消除；无论树林中和幽深的山谷里曾经隐藏了多少积雪，如今留在这风景中的只有两个孤零零的斑点；明天，我找不着它们时，简直会为失去他们而感到遗憾。我想，过去春天从未有如此紧跟冬日退隐的脚步。沿着路边，小草已从雪堆边缘抽出绿叶。牧场和草地还未显现出一派碧绿景象，但也不再是晚秋时节植被完全凋零后阴郁的褐色；晦暗的生命光影现在已经出现，并慢慢明亮起来，汇成温暖的世界。有些地方已经显露出欢快的气氛——比方说，就像那边果园的西南坡，就在河对岸那栋古旧的红砖农舍前——这几块土地已经披上了一抹美丽的嫩绿，就是日后的繁茂也不能再增添一丝妩媚。它看起来不真实，就像一个预言、一个希望，像某种奇特的光留下的短暂影响，稍稍一眨眼就会消失不见。但是美从来就不是幻想；这些嫩绿的土地不是幻影也不是梦境，四周黑暗的荒芜之地才是。大地每时每刻都有某个地方在经历重生；沿河岸洒满阳光的斜坡上突然闪现了一缕翠绿色，而刚才还是光秃秃的褐色。再望去，你便会看到青草的幻影！</td>
		<td class="en">The present Spring comes onward with fleeter footsteps, because winter lingered so unconscionably long, that with her best diligence she can hardly retrieve half the allotted period of her reign.It is but a fortnight since I stood on the brink of our swollen river, and beheld the accumulated ice of four frozen months go down the stream.Except in streaks here and there upon the hill-sides, the whole visible universe was then covered with deep snow, the nethermost layer of which had been deposited by an early December storm.It was a sight to make the beholder torpid, in the impossibility of imagining how this vast white napkin was to be removed from the face of the corpse-like world, in less time than had been required to spread it there.But who can estimate the power of gentle influences, whether amid material desolation, or the moral winter of man's heart!There have been no tempestuous rains—even no sultry days—but a constant breath of southern winds, with now a day of kindly sunshine, and now a no less kindly mist, or a soft descent of showers, in which a smile and a blessing seemed to have been steeped.The snow has vanished as if by magic; whatever heaps may be hidden in the woods and deep gorges of the hills, only two solitary specks remain in the landscape; and those I shall almost regret to miss, when, tomorrow, I look for them in vain.Never before, methinks, has spring pressed so closely on the footsteps of retreating winter.Along the roadside, the green blades of grass have sprouted on the very edge of the snow-drifts.The pastures and mowing fields have not yet assumed a general aspect of verdure; but neither have they the cheerless brown tint which they wear in latter autumn, when vegetation has entirely ceased; there is now a faint shadow of life, gradually brightening into the warm reality.Some tracts, in a happy exposure—as, for instance, yonder south-western slope of an orchard, in front of that old red farm-house, beyond the river—such patches of land already wear a beautiful and tender green, to which no future luxuriance can add a charm.It looks unreal—a prophecy—a hope—a transitory effect of some peculiar light, which will vanish with the slightest motion of the eye.But beauty is never a delusion; not these verdant tracts, but the dark and barren landscape, all around them, is a shadow and a dream.Each moment wins some portion of the earth from death to life; a sudden gleam of verdure brightens along the sunny slope of a bank, which, an instant ago, was brown and bare.You look again, and behold an apparition of green grass!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们果园里以及其他地方的树木虽然现在还是光秃秃的，但看上去已经充满生机和植物的血液。仿佛只要施一点儿魔法，它们就会立刻迸发出茂密的枝叶来，而现在穿行在光秃的树枝间哀鸣的风也会突然在无数的树叶中奏响乐曲。这棵长满青苔的、四十年来一直给这些西窗遮阴蔽日的柳树，将会是众多率先身披绿衣者的其中一个。有人对柳树有些不同看法；它既不干燥也不干净，给观看者黏糊糊的感觉。我想，没有树木能够成为十分合得来的伙伴，除非它们树叶光亮，树皮干燥，枝干质地结实坚固。然而，柳树几乎是最早以其优雅柔软的枝叶实践美的承诺、呈现美的现实来愉悦我们的树，也是最后一个将其黄而不枯的树叶撒落于地的树。而且，整个冬季里，它黄色的枝条让它有种阳光灿烂的样子，即使在最灰暗最阴沉的日子里也能让人高兴起来。在乌云密布的天空下，它忠诚地记着阳光。如果将这棵柳树砍去，白雪覆盖的屋顶上就失去了它金色的树冠和夏日里的葱翠欲滴，那我们的老宅便会失去一股魅力。</td>
		<td class="en">The trees, in our orchard and elsewhere, are as yet naked, but already appear full of life and vegetable blood.It seems as if, by one magic touch, they might instantaneously burst into full foliage, and that the wind, which now sighs through their naked branches, might make sudden music amid innumerable leaves.The moss-grown willow-tree, which for forty years past has overshadowed these western windows, will be among the first to put on its green attire.There are some objections to the willow; it is not a dry and cleanly tree, and impresses the beholder with an association of sliminess.No trees, I think, are perfectly agreeable as companions, unless they have glossy leaves, dry bark, and a firm and hard texture of trunk and branches.But the willow is almost the earliest to gladden us with the promise and reality of beauty, in its graceful and delicate foliage, and the last to scatter its yellow yet scarcely withered leaves upon the ground.All through the winter, too, its yellow twigs give it a sunny aspect, which is not without a cheering influence, even in the grayest and gloomiest day.Beneath a clouded sky, it faithfully remembers the sunshine.Our old house would lose a charm, were the willow to be cut down, with its golden crown over the snow-covered roof, and its heap of summer verdure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我书房窗下的丁香花丛差不多也要长出枝叶了，再过两三天，或许我就能伸手摘下顶上的那支新绿枝条了。这些丁香很有些年头了，不再有盛年时期繁茂的枝叶了。我们的内心、判断力、道德感抑或品味都不满意它们如今的样子。迟暮之年如果放在丁香、玫瑰花丛，或其他所有观赏灌木身上，不会让人肃然起敬；由于这些植物只是为美而生，所以它们似乎只应该在不朽的青春里永远枝繁叶茂，或者至少在它们不幸衰老之前就死去。美丽的树是天堂之树，因此，依其本性，它们不应衰亡腐朽，尽管因为移植到尘世的泥土里它们已经失去了这项与生俱来的宝贵权利。对一丛久经岁月、祖父般年岁的丁香花丛有这般想法，似乎有点儿荒唐和不合时宜。这个比拟在人类生活中倒是适用。人如果仅仅是举止优雅、衣饰华美的——这样的人只能为世界奉献花朵——他们应该在年轻时就死去，永远不要让人见到他们白发苍苍、布满皱纹的样子，就像花丛不应该如我窗下的丁香那样树皮长满青苔、枝叶枯萎。倒不是说美没有资格永恒——不，美应该是永生不朽的——而且，也许正因如此，我们会觉得美丽为时间所战胜是不应该的。但是，苹果树却不会因为变老而受到指责。任它们能活多久就活多久，随心所欲地将自己扭曲成任何怪异的形状，还用春日里艳丽的粉红花朵点缀干枯的枝干，然而它们仍然值得尊敬，即使它们每季只给我们结一两个苹果。那为数不多的几个苹果——或者，不管怎样，记忆中昔日的苹果——都是功利主义因为赐予了苹果树长寿特权而无情索要的补偿。人类的花丛，如果想在世上慢慢变老，除了要开出可爱的花朵，还得结出某种果实来满足尘世的欲望；不然，人类和自然之道都会认为它们身上应该长满青苔。</td>
		<td class="en">The lilac-shrubs, under my study-windows, are likewise almost in leaf; in two or three days more, I may put forth my hand, and pluck the topmost bough in its freshest green.These lilacs are very aged, and have lost the luxuriant foliage of their prime.The heart, or the judgment, or the moral sense, or the taste, is dissatisfied with their present aspect.Old age is not venerable, when it embodies itself in lilacs, rose-bushes, or any other ornamental shrub; it seems as if such plants, as they grow only for beauty, ought to flourish only in immortal youth, or, at least, to die before their sad decrepitude.Trees of beauty are trees of Paradise, and therefore not subject to decay, by their original nature, though they have lost that precious birth-right by being transplanted to an earthly soil.There is a kind of ludicrous unfitness in the idea of a time-stricken and grandfatherly lilac-bush.The analogy holds good in human life.Persons who can only be graceful and ornamental—who can give the world nothing but flowers—should die young, and never be seen with gray hair and wrinkles, any more than the flower-shrubs with mossy bark and blighted foliage, like the lilacs under my window.Not that beauty is worthy of less than immortality,—no, the beautiful should live forever,—and thence, perhaps, the sense of impropriety, when we see it triumphed over by time.Apple-trees, on the other hand, grow old without reproach.Let them live as long as they may, and contort themselves into whatever perversity of shape they please, and deck their withered limbs with a springtime gaudiness of pink-blossoms, still they are respectable, even if they afford us only an apple or two in a season.Those few apples—or, at all events, the remembrance of apples in by-gone years—are the atonement which utilitarianism inexorably demands, for the privilege of lengthened life.Human flower-shrubs, if they will grow old on earth, should, besides their lovely blossoms, bear some kind of fruit that will satisfy earthly appetites; else neither man, nor the decorum of nature, will deem it fit that the moss should gather on them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当冬日的白色布幔被揭下时，隐藏在布幔下的疏漏和混乱是第一个引人注意的事物之一。按我们的偏见，大自然并不洁净。过往岁月的美丽如今变成了褐色枯萎的残缺不全，遮盖了此刻的明亮与美好。我们的街道上撒满了整个秋日的枯叶。许多腐烂的树枝被一阵又一阵的暴风雨摧折下来，已经腐烂变黑；一两根树枝上还挂着鸟巢的残骸。园里干枯的豆蔓、芦笋地里褐色的茎杆和悲伤的老白菜，在不知节俭的耕种者还没来得及收割，这些白菜就已经冻到了泥土里。在所有的生命形式中，我们总能发现这些混合在一起的死亡纪念物！在思想的土壤里，在心灵的花园里，以及在感官的世界里，都躺着干枯的树叶；那些已经被我们丢弃的思想和情感。没有风强大到能将它们吹走；无垠的空间也不会将它们藏匿在我们视线之外。它们意欲何为？为什么我们不能生而享乐？就好像这是最初的生命，我们享受的是原始乐趣，而不是总踩在这些枯骨残骸上，经年累积之后，这些枯骨残骸才萌发出如今看来这般年轻的新生事物。伊甸园的春天一定是甜美的，那时还没有过往的岁月将腐朽洒在处女地上，园中居住者的心里也没有先前的经验，随夏日成熟、随秋日消逝！那是一个值得生活于其中的世界！哦，你这喃喃低语的人，正是因为这种生活的恣意放纵，你才会佯作这些无聊的哀叹。没有腐朽。每个人的灵魂都是自己的伊甸园中最先被创造出来的居民。我们住在布满青苔的老宅里，踩着旧日模糊的足印，日夜与一个老牧师的灵魂同住；然而，所有这些外在环境都因为更新的精神力量而变得毫不虚幻了。如果精神失去了这种力量——如果枯萎的树叶、腐烂的树枝、布满青苔的房屋以及灰色过去的灵魂都成为现实，葱翠和生机只是黯淡的梦想——那么就请让它从这尘世中解脱出去吧。唤醒它原始的活力需要天国的空气!</td>
		<td class="en">One of the first things that strikes the attention, when the white sheet of winter is withdrawn, is the neglect and disarray that lay hidden beneath it.Nature is not cleanly, according to our prejudices.The beauty of preceding years, now transformed to brown and blighted deformity, obstructs the brightening loveliness of the present hour.Our avenue is strewn with the whole crop of autumn’s withered leaves.There are quantities of decayed branches, which one tempest after another has flung down, black and rotten; and one or two with the ruin of a bird's nest clinging to them.In the garden are the dried bean-vines, the brown stalks of the asparagus-bed, and melancholy old cabbages which were frozen into the soil before their unthrifty cultivator could find time to gather them.How invariably, throughout all the forms of life, do we find these intermingled memorials of death!On the soil of thought, and in the garden of the heart, as well as in the sensual world, lie withered leaves;the ideas and feelings that we have done with.There is no wind strong enough to sweep them away; infinite space will not garner them from our sight.What mean they?Why may we not be permitted to live and enjoy, as if this were the first life, and our own the primal enjoyment, instead of treading always on these dry bones and mouldering relics, from the aged accumulation of which springs all that now appears so young and new?Sweet must have been the spring-time of Eden, when no earlier year had strewn its decay upon the virgin turf, and no former experience had ripened into summer, and faded into autumn, in the hearts of its inhabitants!That was a world worth living in!Oh, thou murmurer, it is out of the very wantonness of such a life, that thou feignest these idle lamentations!There is no decay.Each human soul is the first created inhabitant of its own Eden.We dwell in an old moss-covered mansion, and tread in the worn footprints of the past, and have a grey clergyman's ghost for our daily and nightly inmate; yet all these outward circumstances are made less than visionary, by the renewing power of the spirit.Should the spirit ever lose this power—should the withered leaves, and the rotten branches, and the moss-covered house, and the ghost of the grey past, ever become its realities, and the verdure and the freshness merely its faint dream—then let it pray to be released from earth.It will need the air of heaven, to revive its pristine energies!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从我们种着黑梣树的幽暗街道和吉里德树的香脂到无限宇宙，这是多么意外的飞跃！现在，我们的双脚再一次踏上这片草坪。再没什么地方的草能像这里的草一样，在这个寻常院落里，沿着石壁底边，在房屋隐蔽的角落里，特别是在南边的门阶周围，努力地生长；门阶这地方似乎特别有利于它们生长，它们已经长得很高，高到可以弯下腰来，在风中摇曳。我看见，有几株野草——最常见的是一种其黄色汁液会弄脏手指的植物——活了下来，并且整个冬季都保持着生机和活力。人们不知道它们是如何得以免遭它们同类的共同宿命。现在，它们是过去这一年的长老了，或许可以向如今这一代花草宣讲死亡的哲理。</td>
		<td class="en">What an unlooked-for flight was this, from our shadowy avenue of black-ash and Balm of Gilead trees, into the infinite!Now we have our feet again upon the turf.Nowhere does the grass spring up so industriously as in this homely yard, along the base of the stone-wall, and in the sheltered nooks of the buildings, and especially around the southern doorstep; a locality which seems particularly favorable to its growth, for it is already tall enough to bend over and wave in the wind.I observe, that several weeds—and, most frequently, a plant that stains the fingers with its yellow juice—have survived and retained their freshness and sap throughout the winter.One knows not how they have deserved such an exception from the common lot of their race.They are now the patriarchs of the departed year, and may preach mortality to the present generation of flowers and weeds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在春天的快乐里，怎能忘了鸟呢!即使是乌鸦也会受到欢迎，它们被视为更鲜艳、更活泼一族的黑色先驱。积雪还未消融，它们就来看望我们，不过看来它们很有可能是在前往树林深处，将在那里度过整个夏季。我到那里叨扰了它们许多回，当它们在安息日一般的静穆中端坐在树稍时，我感觉自己好像侵入了一群沉默的信徒中。它们说话时声音优美，与夏日午后的宁静孤寂十分和谐；它们响亮的喧闹声远远回响在我们头顶上方，非但没有打破当下宗教式的宁静，反而使之更显静穆。然而，乌鸦没有什么真正的宗教信仰，尽管它们仪态庄严，身着黑衣；它们一定是贼，而且可能是异教徒。从道德的角度来看，海鸥更可敬。它们这些饱经海浪拍击的岩石上的居民，孤寂的海滩上的常客，在这个季节里，会来到我们的内陆河，在空中翱翔，在高空的阳光中拍打它们宽阔的翅膀。它们是最迷人的鸟类之一，因为它们就这样漂浮定格在空中，几乎成了风景中静止的部分。想象有足够的时间熟悉它们；它们不会一下子就飞掠而去。你腾空飞入云层，向这些高飞的海鸥致意，自信地和它们一起在支撑我们的空气中休憩。鸭子在河边的僻静之处流连，成群地飞落在被河水漫过的草甸的宽阔怀抱里。它们飞得太快、太果断，令我们的眼睛无法从中捕捉乐趣，但却总能够在我们的心中激起根深蒂固的运动本能。它们现在已经飞往北边更远的地方，但会在秋天再来看望我们。</td>
		<td class="en">Among the delights of spring, how is it possible to forget the birds!Even the crows were welcome, as the sable harbingers of a brighter and livelier race.They visited us before the snow was off, but seem mostly to have betaken themselves to remote depths of the woods, which they haunt all summer long.Many a time shall I disturb them there, and feel as if I had intruded among a company of silent worshippers, as they sit in sabbath-stillness among the tree-tops.Their voices, when they speak, are in admirable accordance with the tranquil solitude of a summer afternoon; and, resounding so far above the head, their loud clamor increases the religious quiet of the scene, instead of breaking it.A crow, however, has no real pretensions to religion, in spite of his gravity of mien and black attire; he is certainly a thief, and probably an infidel.The gulls are far more respectable, in a moral point of view.These denizens of sea-beaten rocks, and haunters of the lonely beach, come up our inland river, at this season, and soar high overhead, flapping their broad wings in the upper sunshine.They are among the most picturesque of birds, because they so float and rest upon the air, as to become almost stationary parts of the landscape.The imagination has time to grow acquainted with them; they have not flitted away in a moment.You go up among the clouds, and greet these lofty-flighted gulls, and repose confidently with them upon the sustaining atmosphere.Ducks have their haunts along the solitary places of the river, and alight in flocks upon the broad bosom of the overflowed meadows.Their flight is too rapid and determined for the eye to catch enjoyment from it, although it never fails to stir up the heart with the sportsman's ineradicable instinct.They have now gone farther northward, but will visit us again in autumn.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小一点儿的鸟——树林中的小歌手，还有那些出入人类住宅、在遮挡风雨的屋檐下或在果树上筑巢从而赢得人类友谊的那些鸟——要欣赏它们的才能需要比我更温柔的触碰和更温柔的心。它们迸发出的旋律就像从冬天的锁链里释放的小溪。若把它称作是对造物主的赞歌，我们不必觉得这说法太过崇高和庄重，因为大自然总是用太多美丽的景象来描绘这万象更新的一年，除了这些欢乐鸟的曲调，她无法再用其他声音来表达新生生命的情感。然而，它们刚才所唱的乐曲似乎是不经意间所作，并非故意为之。它们在讨论生活与爱情的模式以及它们夏日居所的位置和建筑，没时间坐在树枝上倾情演绎庄重的颂歌或者序曲、歌剧、交响乐和华尔兹。它们提出了令它们焦虑的问题，在简短活跃的讨论中解决了重大问题；只是偶尔，像是出于单纯的喜悦，会有一声嘹亮的婉转鸟鸣响起，亮丽的嗓音震颤涌动，穿越云霄。它们小小的身体同它们的鸣叫一样繁忙；它们不停地拍打翅膀，躁动不安。即使有两三只隐入树梢开会，它们也会因无法抑制的活泼天性而一直摇头摆尾，这使它们实际短暂的生命犹如懒惰人类的族长时代一样漫长。画眉，只要有三种聚在一起，便是我们所有长着羽毛的公民中最吵闹的了。它们成群结对地——比鹅妈妈永世流传的著名的“二十四只”还要多——聚集在毗邻的树梢上，吵吵嚷嚷，如同骚动不安的政治集会那样喧哗混乱。当然，政治一定会引起这种喧闹的争论；但是——与其他所有政客不同——它们在各自的发言中加入了优美的旋律，产生出和谐的整体效果。所有鸟鸣声中，在我听来，最为甜美愉悦的莫过于高耸昏暗、阳光斑驳的谷仓里的燕子的鸣叫了；它们比红胸脯的知更鸟更能引起心灵的共鸣。但是，事实上，在宅院附近安家的所有这些长着翅膀的居民似乎也有了人性；就算这人性还未得到开发，那也已是拥有了不朽灵魂的萌芽。我们听见它们晨昏时悦耳动听的祈祷。就在刚才，在深夜里，从旁边的一棵树上响起了一声高亢的鸟鸣；那是一首真正的歌，迎接紫色的黎明，或者与金色的阳光辉映。这小鸟在深夜倾情唱出这样的歌声是什么意思呢？也许这音乐是从梦中涌出的，在梦里，它想象自己和伴侣一起身在天堂，突然间醒来却是在没有叶子的寒冷树枝上，新英格兰的雾霭渗透进了它的羽毛。从想象到现实，这是多么悲哀的转变!</td>
		<td class="en">The smaller birds—the little songsters of the woods, and those that haunt man's dwellings, and claim human friendship by building their nests under the sheltering eaves, or among the orchard trees—these require a touch more delicate, and a gentler heart than mine, to do them justice.Their outburst of melody is like a brook let loose from wintry chains.We need not deem it a too high and solemn word, to call it a hymn of praise to the Creator; since Nature, who pictures the reviving year in so many sights of beauty, has expressed the sentiment of renewed life in no other sound, save the notes of these blessed birds.Their music, however, just now, seems to be incidental, and not the result of a set purpose.They are discussing the economy of life and love, and the site and architecture of their summer residences, and have no time to sit on a twig, and pour forth solemn hymns, or overtures, operas, symphonies, and waltzes.Anxious questions are asked; grave subjects are settled in quick and animated debate; and only by occasional accident, as from pure ecstasy, does a rich warble roll its tiny waves of golden sound through the atmosphere.Their little bodies are as busy as their voices; they are in a constant flutter and restlessness.Even when two or three retreat to a tree-top, to hold council, they wag their tails and heads all the time, with the irrepressible activity of their nature, which perhaps renders their brief span of life in reality as long as the patriarchal age of sluggish man.The blackbirds, three species of which consort together, are the noisiest of all our feathered citizens.Great companies of them—more than the famous “four-and-twenty” whom Mother Goose has immortalized—congregate in contiguous tree-tops and vociferate with all the clamor and confusion of a turbulent political meeting.Politics, certainly, must be the occasion of such tumultuous debates; but still—unlike all other politicians—they instil melody into their individual utterances, and produce harmony as a general effect.Of all bird-voices, none are more sweet and cheerful to my ear than those of swallows, in the dim, sun-streaked interior of a lofty barn; they address the heart with even a closer sympathy than Robin Red-breast.But, indeed, all these winged people, that dwell in the vicinity of homesteads, seem to partake of human nature, and possess the germ, if not the development, of immortal souls.We hear them saying their melodious prayers, at morning's blush and eventide.A little while ago, in the deep of night, there came the lively thrill of a bird’s note from a neighboring tree; a real song, such as greets the purple dawn, or mingles with the yellow sunshine.What could the little bird mean, by pouring it forth at midnight?Probably the music gushed out of the midst of a dream, in which he fancied himself in Paradise with his mate, but suddenly awoke on a cold, leafless bough, with a New England mist penetrating through his feathers.That was a sad exchange of imagination for reality!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >昆虫是春天最早孕育的生命之一。很久以前，积雪表面就出现了许多我不认识的东西。它们很小，小得几乎看不见，一群一群地在光束中盘旋，然后飞进暗处便消失不见了，仿佛被消灭了似的。已经能听得见蚊子吹响它们那叫人有点儿害怕的号角了。屋子明晃晃的窗户上蝗虫滋生。一只蜜蜂飞进了一个房间，预示着花期的到来。积雪还没有消退，珍稀蝴蝶便来了，在料峭的风中炫耀；尽管她披着镶金边的黑色天鹅绒斗篷，华美亮丽，却显得孤独，完全不合时宜。</td>
		<td class="en">Insects are among the earliest births of spring.Multitudes, of I know not what species, appeared long ago, on the surface of the snow.Clouds of them, almost too minute for sight, hover in a beam of sunshine, and vanish, as if annihilated, when they pass into the shade.A mosquito has already been heard to sound the small horror of his bugle-horn.Wasps infest the sunny windows of the house.A bee entered one of the chambers, with a prophecy of flowers.Rare butterflies came before the snow was off, flaunting in the chill breeze, and looking forlorn and all astray, in spite of the magnificence of their dark velvet cloaks, with golden borders.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >田野和林中小径目前还没有多少迷人之处，吸引不了闲逛的人。前几天散步时，我没见着紫罗兰，没见着银莲花，也没见着任何像花的东西。不过，要想对春天前行的脚步有个大致的了解，不妨爬上我们对面的那座山。我至今仍在仔细观察春天的细微变化。河水在我身旁围成半圆，漫过了所有赋予它印第安名字的草地，在阳光下熠熠闪光，宏伟壮丽。沿着这边的河岸，矗立着一排树木，树的下半截浸在水中；远处的河面上，一丛丛灌木努力向上伸出头来，好像要呼吸空气一样。最引人注目的是那些孤零零的大树，四周一片汪洋。由于浸入河中，树干变短了，完全破坏了树木的美好比例，也因此使我们感受到了自然界常态下的规则和合理。这一季的洪水——尽管水量不至于大到使我们这条平静的河流泛滥成灾——比以往（至少二十年以来）的任何一场洪水侵入的土地面积更广。洪水漫过了石篱笆，甚至使一段公路能够行船。</td>
		<td class="en">The fields and wood-paths have as yet few charms to entice the wanderer.In a walk, the other day, I found no violets, nor anemones, nor anything in the likeness of a flower.It was worth while, however, to ascend our opposite hill, for the sake of gaining a general idea of the advance of spring, which I had hitherto been studying in its minute developments.The river lay around me in a semicircle, overflowing all the meadows which give it its Indian name, and offering a noble breadth to sparkle in the sunbeams.Along the hither shore, a row of trees stood up to their knees in water; and afar off, on the surface of the stream, tufts of bushes thrust up their heads, as it were, to breathe.The most striking objects were great solitary trees, here and there, with a mile-wide waste of water all around them.The curtailment of the trunk, by its immersion in the river, quite destroys the fair proportions of the tree, and thus makes us sensible of a regularity and propriety in the usual forms of nature.The flood of the present season—though it never amounts to a freshet, on our quiet stream—has encroached farther upon the land than any previous one, for at least a score of years.It has overflowed stone-fences, and even rendered a portion of the highway navigable for boats.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，洪水现在正渐渐退去，一些小岛连上了陆地，又有一些小岛像新创造出的一样从汪洋中冒了出来。这场面让人想起尼罗河退水的宏伟景象，只是这里没有黑色泥浆的沉积；或者它会让人想起诺亚洪水，只不过此时在这些重新显现的陆地上还有一丝清新和活力，让人觉得这是一个刚刚打造的世界，而不是一个被严重污染了的需要洪水净化的世界。这些新冒出的岛屿是这天地间最绿的几处地方，阳光一照就足以让它们披上绿装。</td>
		<td class="en">The waters, however, are now gradually subsiding; islands become annexed to the mainland; and other islands emerge, like new creations, from the watery waste.The scene supplies an admirable image of the receding of the Nile—except that there is no deposit of black slime;—or of Noah's flood—only that there is a freshness and novelty in these recovered portions of the continent, which give the impression of a world just made, rather than of one so polluted that a deluge had been requisite to purify it.These up-springing islands are the greenest spots in the landscape; the first gleam of sunlight suffices to cover them with verdure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >感谢上帝赐予的春天！如果生命疲惫地艰难前行，没有这样定期注入原始活力，地球——还有诞生于其上的人类自身都将会与我们现在所见到的全然不同。世界会不会变得腐朽不堪，就连春天也无法让它重新焕发绿色？人类会不会凄惨地历尽沧桑，青春的阳光丝毫不会再次照耀他，一年一次？这不可能。在我们被岁月侵蚀的房屋上，青苔明亮而美丽；曾经在这里住过的善良的老牧师，在他度过的第九十个春天的和风中，重新焕发青春，返老还童。唉，一个身体疲惫、心情沉重的人，不论他年少还是年老，如果不再享有春天的活力，该有多么悲哀！这样的人，世人千万别指望他改过自新——也别指望他能认同那些为他奋斗的人的崇高信仰和英勇斗争。夏天只在当下操劳，不思未来；秋天是富有的保守派；冬天则完全失去了自己的信念，战战兢兢地固守着昔日的回忆；而春天，因其倾泻而出的生命力，是进取的真正典范。</td>
		<td class="en">Thank Providence for Spring!The earth—and man himself, by sympathy with his birth-place—would be far other than we find them, if life toiled wearily onward, without this periodical infusion of the primal spirit.Will the world ever be so decayed, that spring may not renew its greenness?Can man be so dismally age-stricken, that no faintest sunshine of his youth may revisit him once a year?It is impossible.The moss on our time-worn mansion brightens into beauty; the good old pastor, who once dwelt here, renewed his prime, regained his boyhood, in the genial breezes of his ninetieth spring.Alas for the worn and heavy soul, if, whether in youth or age, it have outlived its privilege of spring-time sprightliness!From such a soul,the world must hope no reformation of its evil—no sympathy with the lofty faith and gallant struggles of those who contend in its behalf.Summer works in the present, and thinks not of the future; Autumn is a rich conservative; Winter has utterly lost its faith, and clings tremulously to the remembrance of what has been; but Spring, with its outgushing life, is the true type of the Movement.</td></tr>
