		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生还在桌子跟前用早餐，因为他通常都起得相当晚，除非是赶上了一种不在少数的例外情况，那就是彻夜不眠。我站在壁炉跟前的小毯子上，拿起了昨晚的访客落下的手杖。这是一根做工精细的沉重木杖，带有圆头，正是人们常说的“槟榔讼棍”[^1]。紧靠圆头下方的位置有一圈将近一英寸[^2]宽的银箍，上面刻着“皇家外科医师学会[^3]会员詹姆斯·莫蒂默惠存，C. C. H. 友人敬赠”，日期则是“1884”。老派的家庭诊所医生往往喜欢使用这种手杖，因为它庄重威严、分量十足、令人心安。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearthrug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.” Just under the head was a broad silver band, nearly an inch across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry— dignified, solid, and reassuring.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喂，华生，这东西你怎么看呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >福尔摩斯是背对我坐着的，而我摆弄手杖的时候并没有弄出任何动静。</td>
		<td class="en">Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你怎么知道我在做什么？我看你是脑后长了眼睛吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我脑后虽然没长眼睛，面前却有一只精光锃亮的镀银咖啡壶，”他说道，“好了，华生，说说看，咱们这位客人的手杖给了你一些什么提示呢？不巧的是咱们没跟他见上面，没能了解到他的来意，既然如此，这个意外落下的纪念品就显得格外重要。你好好看看这根手杖，把手杖主人的情况说给我听听吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“按我看，”我一边说，一边尽量模仿我室友的方法，“既然莫蒂默医生的友人用这么一根手杖向他致敬，他应该是医学界的一位成功人士，年纪不小、名望很高。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed, since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很好！”福尔摩斯说道，“好极了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我还觉得，他很可能是一名乡村医生，出诊的时候经常都是步行。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why so?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“原因在于，这根手杖虽然十分精致，上面却留下了许多磕碰的痕迹，城里的医生肯定不愿意拿着它到处走。手杖末端的加厚铁箍也磨损得非常厉害，主人显然是经常带着它走路。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one, has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很有道理！”福尔摩斯说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还有啊，手杖上刻着‘C. C. H. 友人’字样，这个‘C. C. H.’的意思多半是‘某某狩猎俱乐部’[^4]。他兴许是给当地某个狩猎俱乐部的会员治过伤，俱乐部就用这根手杖作为小小的谢礼。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“说实在的，华生，你真是让我刮目相看，”福尔摩斯说道，把椅子往后挪了挪，点上了一支香烟。“我不得不指出，在费心记述我那些小小成就的时候，你总是习惯性地低估你自个儿的本领。你也许并不是发光体，可你是光的导体。有些人本身没有天才，激发天才的本领却十分可观。坦白说，亲爱的伙计，我确实欠了 你很大的恩情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他从来没有给过我如此称誉，经常都对我的衷心赞美无动于衷，对我宣传他那些方法的努力嗤之以鼻，致使我深感颜面伤损，所以我必须承认，听到他这些话的时候，我真是喜不自禁。与此同时，我还觉得非常自豪，因为我感到自己已经对他的方法颇有心得，不但能够实际运用，甚至能够赢得他的赞赏。接下来，他从我手里拿过手杖，仔仔细细地看了几分钟，然后就露出一副很感兴趣的神情，放下香烟，把手杖拿到窗边，用放大镜看了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“简单归简单，多少也有点儿意思，”他坐回了长椅上他最喜欢的那个角落，如是说道，“这根手杖确实给出了那么一两点提示，咱们可以据此得出几个推论。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有什么我看漏了的地方吗？”我问话的口气多少有点儿自鸣得意，“依我看，我应该没有漏掉什么重要的细节吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“恐怕我不得不说，亲爱的华生，你的大多数结论都是错的。刚才我说你激发了我，意思说白了就是，我偶尔可以通过发现你的错误来找到正确的方向。当然喽，这次你也不能说是全错。这个人确实是一名乡村医生，确实也经常走路。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那我就说对了啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then I was right.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“只有这两点是对的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“To that extent.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“全部的情况也只有这两点啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But that was all.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，不是，亲爱的华生，不是全部——绝对不是全部。举个例子吧，让我来说的话，我倒是觉得，当医生的人不大可能从什么狩猎俱乐部收到礼物，礼物多半是来自一家医院，‘C. C.’这两个字母既然摆在‘医院’的前头，显然就是‘Charing Cross’的缩写[^5]。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“也许你是对的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You may be right.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“多半是对的。好了，这个推测没错的话，咱们就有了一个全新的出发点，可以据此演绎这位神秘访客的其他情况。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，假设‘C. C. H.’确实代表‘查令十字医院’的话，咱们又能演绎出什么情况呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就没有什么让你觉得一目了然的情况吗？我的方法你是知道的，用啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我能想出来的只有那个十分明显的结论，也就是说，下乡之前，这个人曾经在城里行医。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我倒是觉得，咱们可以大着胆子往前捋一捋。咱们不妨从这个方面来想，人家送他这么一件礼物，最应景的场合是什么呢？碰上什么样的情形，他那些朋友才会凑钱送他一件表示友情的纪念品呢？显然是在莫蒂默医生离开医院自己创业的时候。咱们知道朋友们送了这么一件礼物，又推测到他经历过一次从城镇医院到乡村诊所的转变，在此基础之上，说礼物是在转变来临的时候送的，有什么特别牵强的地方吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听起来确实很有可能。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It certainly seems probable.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好了，你应该看得出来，他不会是医院的正式医师，原因在于，能拥有这种身份的都是在伦敦很有名望的医生，这样的医生也就不会往乡下跑了。如此说来，他会是什么身份呢。既然他待在医院里，又不是医院正式聘任的医生，那他就只能是一名见习外科医生或者是见习内科医生，地位比高年级医科学生高不了多少[^6]。除此之外，他离开医院不过是五年之前的事情，日期就刻在手杖上呢。这么一看，亲爱的华生，你那个严肃稳重、人到中年的家庭诊所医生立刻化为乌有，取而代之的是一个不到三十岁的小伙子，他随和可亲、淡泊名利、丢三落四，还养着一只心爱的狗儿，大致说来，他的狗儿应该比梗犬大，同时又比獒犬小。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absentminded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我不以为然地笑了笑，歇洛克·福尔摩斯则靠回椅背，喷出一个个小小的烟圈，袅袅地升向天花板。</td>
		<td class="en">I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你刚才说的后面几点，我没有办法检验，”我说道，“不过，再怎么说，这个人的年龄和专业履历之类的细节并不是什么特别难查的东西。”我那个小书架上摆的都是些医学书籍，于是我把那本医生名录拿了下来，翻到了“莫蒂默”这个姓氏。名录里有好几个姓莫蒂默的人，其中却只有一个跟我们的访客对得上。我把这个人的介绍念了出来。</td>
		<td class="en">“As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I, “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“里面没提到你那个当地的狩猎俱乐部啊，华生，”福尔摩斯露出了恶作剧式的笑容，“不过，他的确是一名乡村医生，这一点你看得非常准。按我看，这段文字基本上证实了我的推测。至于他的个性嘛，我记得我用的词汇是‘随和可亲’、‘淡泊名利’和‘丢三落四’。按我的经验，如今的这个世道，只有随和可亲的人才会收到临别赠礼，只有淡泊名利的人才会扔掉伦敦的工作往乡下跑，也只有丢三落四的人才会在别人的房间里等上一个小时，没留下自己的名片，倒是把自己的手杖给留下了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“狗儿的事情又怎么说呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And the dog?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这只狗儿经常都叼着这根手杖跟在主人身后，手杖十分沉重，狗儿只好紧紧地咬住手杖的中段，由此留下了十分清楚的牙印。从牙印的间隔来看，这只狗儿的嘴巴比梗犬宽，同时又没有獒犬那么宽，兴许是——没错，我敢打包票，确实是一只卷毛的斯班尼犬[^10]。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been—yes, by Jove, it *is*a curly-haired spaniel.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之前他已经站了起来，开始在房间里来回踱步，这会儿则停在了凸肚窗的凹处。他说话的口气肯定得让人惊讶，我不由得抬头看了看他。</td>
		<td class="en">He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的伙计，这一点你怎么能这么肯定呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“原因非常简单，这只狗已经出现在了咱们的家门口，拉门铃的就是它的主人。别走，华生，听我的。他是你的同行弟兄，你在场可能会对我有所帮助。华生，眼下可是个决定命运的转折关头，你听见了楼梯上的脚步声，知道有个人正在走进你的生活，可你并不知道这件事情是吉是凶。研究科学的詹姆斯·莫蒂默医生上门造访研究罪行的歇洛克·福尔摩斯，究竟能有什么事情呢？请进！”</td>
		<td class="en">“For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我本以为我们的客人会是个典型的乡村医生，看到他之后就不免吃了一惊。他个子非常高，身材非常瘦，金边眼镜后面是一双精光闪亮的灰色眼睛，两只眼睛挨得很近，中间支棱着一个鸟喙一般的长鼻子。他的打扮倒符合专业人士的身份，同时又显得相当邋遢，因为他的双排扣礼服大衣脏兮兮的，裤子也磨得起了毛。他年纪还轻，长长的脊背却已经有点儿佝偻，走路的时候头往前伸，总的看来像是个爱管闲事的好心人。走进房间之后，他立刻瞧见了福尔摩斯手里的手杖，于是便欢呼一声，冲着手杖跑了过去。“这可真叫人高兴，”他说道，“我一直都没想起来，手杖是落在了这儿，还是落在了航运公司。这根手杖可是我的宝贝，说什么也不能弄 丢了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world.”</td></tr>

This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a byword through the West. It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name. So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he well knew. When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom. Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who said them. At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father’s farm.</td></tr>

Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him. In these days of *nouveaux riches*it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realized his gains and returned to England with them. It is only two years since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death. Being himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.

Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been impaired, and points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.

The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person, and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him—it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s younger brother. The young man when last heard of was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune.”</td></tr>

He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?”</td></tr>

I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall.

There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist—Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire.
