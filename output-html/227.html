		<td class="en">by Washington Irving</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >故事发生在市议员奥尔德曼·波普金斯的马车到泰拉奇纳旅店的前几天。在欧洲大陆见过英式家族马车行驶的人,肯定了解这样的马车所能引起的轰动。这辆马车是漂流于世界里的古老的英国岛屿的一个小小缩影——每一个细微的地方都非常小巧舒适，精致得体。车轮绕着特制的车轴转动，轮子不会发出咯咯的响声；车身和弹簧完美契合、行动自如，能够防备每一次颠簸。</td>
		<td class="en">It was but a few days before that the carriage of Alderman Popkins had driven up to the inn of Terracina.Those who have seen an English family carriage on the continent, must know the sensation it produces.It is an epitome of England; a little morsel of the old island rolling about the world—every thing so compact, so snug, so finished and fitting.The wheels that roll on patent axles without rattling; the body that hangs so well on its springs, yielding to every motion, yet proof against every shock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一张张红润的脸时不时探出窗外——有时是个上了年纪的肥胖的老者，有时是个丰盈的贵妇人，有时是个刚从寄宿学校回来的娇嫩的淘气姑娘。马车尾座上坐着穿着讲究的仆人，身体结实，一副虚张声势的神态；他们居高临下，以鄙夷的眼光看着周围的世界；他们对这个国家和人们都一无所知，他们深信，不属于英国的东西都不是好东西。</td>
		<td class="en">The ruddy faces gaping out of the windows; sometimes of a portly old citizen, sometimes of a voluminous dowager, and sometimes of a fine fresh hoyden, just from boarding school.And then the dickeys loaded with well-dressed servants, beef-fed and bluff; looking down from their heights with contempt on all the world around; profoundly ignorant of the country and the people, and devoutly certain that every thing not English must be wrong.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是市议员波普金斯的马车，它在泰拉奇纳出现时，就是这种情形。那个受雇在前面的马夫，是那不勒斯人，他用意大利人对市议员头衔和身份那样的想象力，大肆渲染他主人的富有和伟大，信口吹嘘他主人的头衔和身份。而那位主人在此之上又添上了他平时的张扬，所以当市政员的马车到达门口时，他做过老爷——权贵——亲王——天知道他到底是什么！</td>
		<td class="en">Such was the carriage of Alderman Popkins, as it made its appearance at Terracina.The courier who had preceded it, to order horses, and who was a Neapolitan, had given a magnificent account of the riches and greatness of his master, blundering with all an Italian’s splendor of imagination about the alderman’s titles and dignities; the host had added his usual share of exaggeration, so that by the time the alderman drove up to the door, he was Milor—Magnifico—Principe—the Lord knows what!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大家曾建议让人护送他到丰迪和伊奇，但他拒绝了。他说，谁敢拦截王者之路，就是死路一条；他会向驻在那不勒斯的大使投诉，把这事搞得全国皆知。波普金斯夫人，这位年轻、仁慈的贵妇人，在他这位全能的丈夫的保护下，看起来在这个城市里无比安全。两位漂亮、活泼的波普金斯小姐，指望着她们学过拳击的哥哥汤姆的保护；而那个纨绔子弟汤姆则确信没有哪一个意大利的无赖强盗敢惹英国人的麻烦。店主耸耸肩膀，双手一摊，扮了个十足的意大利怪相，于是，麦络·波普金斯的马车又朝前走了。</td>
		<td class="en">The alderman was advised to take an escort to Fondi and Itri, but he refused.It was as much as a man’s life was worth, he said, to stop him on the king’s highway; he would complain of it to the ambassador at Naples; he would make a national affair of it.The principezza Popkins, a fresh, motherly dame, seemed perfectly secure in the protection of her husband, so omnipotent a man in the city.The signorini Popkins, two fine bouncing girls, looked to their brother Tom, who had taken lessons in boxing; and as to the dandy himself, he was sure no scaramouch of an Italian robber would dare to meddle with an Englishman.The landlord shrugged his shoulders and turned out the palms of his hands with a true Italian grimace, and the carriage of Milor Popkins rolled on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们经过了几个非常可疑的地方，但没有遭遇任何骚扰。两位波普金斯小姐非常浪漫，她们学过水彩画，对周围那种原始景色心醉神迷。这景色多像她们在拉德克利夫夫人的浪漫故事中读到的情景啊，她们真想把所有的景色都勾勒出来。最后，马车到了一个地方，道路沿着绵长的山坡蜿蜒而上。</td>
		<td class="en">They passed through several very suspicious places without any molestation.The Misses Popkins, who were very romantic, and had learnt to draw in water colors, were enchanted with the savage scenery around; it was so like what they had read in Mrs. Radcliffe’s romances, they should like of all things to make sketches.At length, the carriage arrived at a place where the road wound up a long hill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波普金斯夫人已经睡过去了，两位年轻的小姐正在读沃尔特·斯科特先生和拜伦王爵的最新著作,那个纨绔子弟汤姆正在吓唬驾左马的车夫。市议员走下马车，说是要到山上去活动活动筋骨。这个上坡路很漫长，市议员不得不时不时地停下来，喘口气或擦擦额头、哼哼几声、咂咂舌头，累得上气不接下气。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Popkins had sunk into a sleep; the young ladies were reading the last works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron, and the dandy was hectoring the postilions from the coach box.The Alderman got out, as he said, to stretch his legs up the hill.It was a long winding ascent, and obliged him every now and then to stop and blow and wipe his forehead with many a pish! and phew! being rather pursy and short of wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那辆马车驮着重重的行李，载着酒足饭饱的旅行者，被市议员远远地落在身后，费力地往前走。因此，这个市议员有足够的时间轻松漫步。</td>
		<td class="en">As the carriage, however, was far behind him, and toiling slowly under the weight of so many well-stuffed trunks and well-stuffed travellers, he had plenty of time to walk at leisure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在快到山顶的地方，也就是道路又开始下坡的地方，有一块凸出的岩石悬在路面上，波普金斯看到一个人独自坐在那里，像是在牧羊。市议员波普金斯是个聪明的旅行者，总是喜欢沿途搜集一些琐碎的信息。因此，他想他可以爬上山去和那个实在的人聊上几句，听听新闻，了解一些意大利的事情。当波普金斯靠近那个人的时候，他发现自己对那个人的相貌没有半点好感。那人斜靠在岩石上，披着一件普通的长披风，帽子耷拉着，只能看见帽子下面一半黝黑的脸，一只目光敏锐的黑色眼睛，一道凸生的浓眉毛，还有一把浓密的胡子。</td>
		<td class="en">On a jutting point of rock that overhung the road nearly at the summit of the hill, just where the route began again to descend, he saw a solitary man seated, who appeared to be tending goats.Alderman Popkins was one of your shrewd travellers that always like to be picking up small information along the road, so he thought he’d just scramble up to the honest man, and have a little talk with him by way of learning the news and getting a lesson in Italian.As he drew near to the peasant he did not half like his looks.He was partly reclining on the rocks wrapped in the usual long mantle, which, with his slouched hat, only left a part of a swarthy visage, with a keen black eye, a beetle brow, and a fierce moustache to be seen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他对着在山边转悠的狗吹了几次口哨。看到市议员走过来了，那个人起身跟他打招呼。当那人站直身子时，看起来像个巨人，至少在市议员波普金斯看来是这样，然而，不管哪个矮个子的人，都可能会产生这样错觉。</td>
		<td class="en">He had whistled several times to his dog which was roving about the side of the hill.As the Alderman approached he rose and greeted him.When standing erect he seemed almost gigantic, at least in the eyes of Alderman Popkins; who, however, being a short man, might be deceived.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波普金斯现在情愿回到马车里，或是掉头回伦敦交易所，因为他一点儿也不喜欢眼前这个家伙。然而，他决意摆出最和善的笑容，开始和那个家伙谈论天气、歉收的庄稼，还有当地山羊的价格。就在这时，他听到了一阵刺耳的尖叫声。他跑到岩石边，四处观望，沿着路面向下望去，发现他的马车被强盗包围了。</td>
		<td class="en">The latter would gladly now have been back in the carriage, or even on ’change in London, for he was by no means well pleased with his company.However, he determined to put the best face on matters, and was beginning a conversation about the state of the weather, the baddishness of the crops, and the price of goats in that part of the country, when he heard a violent screaming.He ran to the edge of the rock, and, looking over, saw away down the road his carriage surrounded by robbers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个强盗擒着肥胖的男仆，一个拽着汤姆笔挺的领带，并用枪抵着他的脑袋，还有一个在翻他们的旅行箱，另一个则在翻找他夫人的提包。这时，两位波普金斯小姐从马车的两个窗户探出头来尖叫着，她们的女仆在后座上嚎啕大哭。</td>
		<td class="en">One held down the fat footman, another had the dandy by his starched cravat, with a pistol to his head; one was rummaging a portmanteau, another rummaging the principezza’s pockets, while the two Misses Popkins were screaming from each window of the carriage, and their waiting maid squalling from the dickey.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >奥尔德曼·波普金斯感到内心里爆发出一个父母官的所有愤怒。他抓起手杖，准备爬下岩石，去跟强盗对抗或控诉如此残暴的行为，但这时，他的一只胳膊被人抓住了。是他的朋友，那位牧羊人抓住了他。牧羊人的斗篷有一部分滑落下来，露出了别满手枪和匕首的腰带。总之，波普金斯发现自己已经落入强盗首领的手里。这个强盗头子假扮成牧羊人，以便在岩石旁搜寻旅客，并给他的同伙传达信号。</td>
		<td class="en">Alderman Popkins felt all the fury of the parent and the magistrate Roused within him.He grasped his cane and was on the point of scrambling down the rocks, either to assault the robbers or to read the riot act, when he was suddenly grasped by the arm.It was by his friend the goatherd, whose cloak, falling partly off, discovered a belt stuck full of pistols and stilettos.In short, he found himself in the clutches of the captain of the band, who had stationed himself on the rock to look out for travellers and to give notice to his men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一场悲惨的洗劫发生了。旅行箱被翻了个底朝天，波普金斯家所有华丽的服饰和细软散落一地。现场一片混乱，威尼斯的珠子、罗马的镶嵌工艺品和年轻女士的巴黎软帽，还有市政官的睡帽、羊绒长袜，哪个纨绔子弟的梳子、紧身衣、上过浆的领带统统混在了一起。</td>
		<td class="en">A sad ransacking took place.Trunks were turned inside out, and all the finery and the frippery of the Popkins family scattered about the road.Such a chaos of Venice beads and Roman mosaics; and Paris bonnets of the young ladies, mingled with the alderman’s night-caps and lamb’s wool stockings, and the dandy’s hair-brushes, stays, and starched cravats.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >市政官的钱包和手表、女士的珠宝都被夺走了。幸运的是，正当盗贼们要把他们一大家子押到山里去时，远处来了一些军人，盗贼这才带着他们劫掠的赃物逃跑了，一路逃到丰迪去，留下波普金斯一家人收拾剩下的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">The gentlemen were eased of their purses and their watches; the ladies of their jewels, and the whole party were on the point of being carried up into the mountain, when fortunately the appearance of soldiery at a distance obliged the robbers to make off with the spoils they had secured, and leave the Popkins family to gather together the remnants of their effects, and make the best of their way to Fondi.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他们一家人安全抵达丰迪后，这个市议员在旅馆里大发雷霆，威胁要向驻那不勒斯的大使申诉，并且准备在整个国家都发发威。纨绔子弟汤姆有一大堆和强盗搏斗的故事要讲，这些强盗仅仅在数量上占优势。至于两位小姐，她们完全沉浸在冒险的欢乐里，整个下午都忙着把这次冒险经历写进日记里。她们声称，强盗头子是个非常帅气的男人。她们竟然还把他说成是某个不幸的恋人、被流放的贵族，还说其中几个强盗都是非常帅气的年轻人——“太迷人了！”</td>
		<td class="en">When safe arrived, the alderman made a terrible blustering at the inn; threatened to complain to the ambassador at Naples, and was ready to shake his cane at the whole country.The dandy had many stories to tell of his scuffles with the brigands, who overpowered him merely by numbers.As to the Misses Popkins, they were quite delighted with the adventure, and were occupied the whole evening in writing it in their journals.They declared the captain of the band to be a most romantic-looking man; they dared to say some unfortunate lover, or exiled nobleman: and several of the band to be very handsome young men—“quite picturesque!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“事实上，”泰拉奇纳的煤矿老板说，“她们还说强盗头子有骑士风度。”</td>
		<td class="en">“In verity,” said mine host of Terracina, “they say the captain of the band is un galant uomo.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那位英国人说：“一个有骑士风度的人！我宁愿把你所谓的有骑士风度的人像狗一样吊死！”</td>
		<td class="en">“A gallant man!” said the Englishman.“I’d have your gallant man hang’d like a dog!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“竟敢骚扰英国人！”霍布斯先生说。</td>
		<td class="en">“To dare to meddle with Englishmen!” said Mr. Hobbs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“而且还是像波普金斯这样的家庭！”多布斯先生说。</td>
		<td class="en">“And such a family as the Popkinses!” said Mr. Dobbs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们应要求这个国家赔偿损失！”霍布斯先生说。</td>
		<td class="en">“They ought to come upon the country for damages!” said Mr. Hobbs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们的大使还应向那不勒斯政府提出控诉。”多布斯先生说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Our ambassador should make a complaint to the government of Naples,” said Mr. Dobbs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们应该要求政府将这些恶棍驱除出境。”霍布斯先生说。</td>
		<td class="en">“They should be requested to drive these rascals out of the country,” said Hobbs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果政府不这样做，我们就向他们宣战！”多布斯先生说。</td>
		<td class="en">“If they did not, we should declare war against them!” said Dobbs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个英国人有些厌倦了这个故事，厌倦了同乡的过度热情，当有人招呼他们吃晚饭时，他很高兴能从这群旅客中解脱出来。他和他的威尼斯朋友们，还有一个举止有趣的年轻的法国人一起走了出来。聊天时，这个法国人与他们熟络了起来。他们径直朝着大海走去，海面在月光的映射下，闪闪发光。出于礼貌，那个威尼斯人让这位英国人护送他漂亮的妻子回家。然而，或是出于害羞，或是出于保守，那个英国人继续向前走着，并没有主动伸出他的胳膊，展现他的礼貌。那个美丽的威尼斯女人，一切都听从她的丈夫，已经习惯了别人为自己的魅力而大献殷勤，现在却被这位英国人惹恼了，她怄气地挽起了那个法国人伸过来的胳膊，然而，却对那个英国人的冷淡举止耿耿于怀。</td>
		<td class="en">The Englishman was a little wearied by this story, and by the ultra zeal of his countrymen, and was glad when a summons to their supper relieved him from a crowd of travellers.He walked out with his Venetian friends and a young Frenchman of an interesting demeanor, who had become sociable with them in the course of the conversation.They directed their steps toward the sea, which was lit up by the rising moon.The Venetian, out of politeness, left his beautiful wife to be escorted by the Englishman.The latter, however, either from shyness or reserve, did not avail himself of the civility, but walked on without offering his arm.The fair Venetian, with all her devotion to her husband, was a little nettled at a want of gallantry to which her charms had rendered her unaccustomed, and took the proffered arm of the Frenchman with a pretty air of pique, which, however, was entirely lost upon the phlegmatic delinquent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们到了离旅店不远的沙滩上，那里有一队士兵，围成一圈看守着一群囚犯。那些囚犯正在放风，吹吹晚风，在沙滩上打打滚、做做运动。</td>
		<td class="en">Not far distant from the inn they came to where there was a body of soldiers on the beach, encircling and guarding a number of galley slaves, who were permitted to refresh themselves in the evening breeze, and to sport and roll upon the sand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个法国人说：“很难想象，还会有比这批罪犯更可怕的人了。他们当中有弑父母的，杀兄弟的，还有残害婴儿的，先逃过法律的制裁，变成了山贼，接着，他们就出卖他们自己的兄弟，花钱给自己减刑，和这些恶棍一起，每天在沙滩上滚上一小时！”</td>
		<td class="en">“It was difficult,” the Frenchman observed, “to conceive a more frightful mass of crime than was here collected.The parricide, the fratricide, the infanticide, who had first fled from justice and turned mountain bandit, and then, by betraying his brother desperadoes, had bought a commutation of punishment, and the privilege of wallowing on the shore for an hour a day, with this wretched crew of miscreants!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个法国人的评论在同伴中产生了极大的影响，尤其是那个漂亮的威尼斯女人，她战栗着，羞怯地瞥了一眼这些在晚间放松的恶棍。“他们看起来，”她说，“像缠绕在一起的蛇。”</td>
		<td class="en">The remark of the Frenchman had a strong effect upon the company, particularly upon the Venetian lady, who shuddered as she cast a timid look at this horde of wretches at their evening relaxation.“They seemed,” she said, “like so many serpents, wreathing and twisting together.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，这个法国人开始谈及他们在小酒馆听到的故事，还补充说，如果他们对这个话题还有兴趣，他可以再讲一个和强盗有关的冒险故事，就发生在他自己身上，这个故事或许可以让他们了解那些强盗的习惯和举止。这个法国人谦逊和直率的神态赢得了大家的好感，即使那个英国人也不例外。他们都很乐意接受这个法国人的提议，当他们在海边来回漫步的时候，他讲述了下面的历险故事。</td>
		<td class="en">The Frenchman now adverted to the stories they had been listening to at the inn, adding, that if they had any further curiosity on the subject, he could recount an adventure which happened to himself among the robbers and which might give them some idea of the habits and manners of those beings.There was an air of modesty and frankness about the Frenchman which had gained the good-will of the whole party, not even excepting the Englishman.They all gladly accepted his proposition; and as they strolled slowly up and down the seashore, he related the following adventure.</td></tr>
