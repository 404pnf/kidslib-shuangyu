		<td class="en">by Katherine Mansfield</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今天下午会有两位新客人要来。”公寓经理一边说着，一边在早餐桌旁为我放了把椅子，“今天一早我才收到信，知道了这件事。冯·高尔男爵夫人打算送她的小女儿——可怜的小哑巴——来这儿‘治病’。她会在这儿呆一个月，男爵夫人随后也会来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There are two new guests arriving this afternoon,” said the manager of the pension, placing a chair for me at the breakfast table.“I have only received the letter acquainting me with the fact this morning.The Baroness von Gall is sending her little daughter—the poor child is dumb—to make the ‘cure.’She is to stay with us a month, and then the Baroness herself is coming.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“冯·高尔男爵夫人！”博士太太喊道。她正往屋里走，一听到这名字就激动了起来。“要到咱们这儿来？上星期，她的照片在《运动和沙龙》杂志上刚被登出。她是皇室的朋友。我曾听说连皇后和她说话时都用‘你’相称。不过这真是让人高兴！我要接受医生的建议，在这儿多住六个星期。没有什么事情能像跟年轻人交往那样让人开心。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Baroness von Gall,” cried the Frau Doktor, coming into the room and positively scenting the name.“Coming here? There was a picture of her only last week in ‘Sport and Salon.’ She is a friend of the court: I have heard that the Kaiserin says ‘du’ to her. But this is delightful! I shall take my doctor’s advice and spend an extra six weeks here. There is nothing like young society.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可那孩子是个哑巴。”经理小心并满怀歉意地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“But the child is dumb,” ventured the manager apologetically.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃！那又有什么关系？生病的孩子的举动才招人喜欢呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Bah! What does that matter? Afflicted children have such pretty ways.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每一个走进餐厅的客人都被这个惊人的消息给震到了。“冯•高尔男爵夫人要送她的小女儿到这儿来啦，而且不出一个月，男爵夫人本人也会来。”咖啡和面包卷仿佛也跟着狂喜起来。我们精神焕发。大家坐饮咖啡，添油加醋地不停地在谈论着这个名门的奇闻异事；就像大口大口地吃着裹了厚厚一层黄油的面包，我们大肆讨论着关于贵族的流言蜚语。</td>
		<td class="en">Each guest who came into the breakfast-room was bombarded with the wonderful news.“The Baroness von Gall is sending her little daughter here; the Baroness herself is coming in a month’s time.”Coffee and rolls took on the nature of an orgy.We positively scintillated.Anecdotes of the High Born were poured out, sweetened and sipped: we gorged on scandals of High Birth generously buttered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她们将住在您的隔壁，”经理对我说，“我在想，您允不允许我取下您床上边的那幅伊丽莎白皇后的肖像，把它挂到她们的沙发上方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They are to have the room next to yours,” said the manager, addressing me.“I was wondering if you would permit me to take down the portrait of the Kaiserin Elizabeth from above your bed to hang over their sofa.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，确实该这样，要有点家的感觉，”奥伯雷吉龙施特拉太太拍了拍我的手说，“何况这对你也不是很重要。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, indeed, something homelike”—the Frau Oberregierungsrat patted my hand—“and of no possible significance to you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我感觉有些沮丧。倒不是因为看不到那戴着钻石、穿着蓝天鹅绒上衣的人，而是由于她说话的语气，好像给我打上了外国人的烙印，并把我从这个圈子里排挤了出去。</td>
		<td class="en">I felt a little crushed.Not at the prospect of losing that vision of diamonds and blue velvet bust, but at the tone—placing me outside the pale—branding me as a foreigner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们一整天都在有根有据地猜想。下午天气太热，不方便出去散步，于是我们就决定躺在床上，为下午喝咖啡而积蓄精力。后来一辆马车停在了门口。一个高个子的年轻姑娘走了下来，牵着一个小女孩的手。她们一进了门厅就有人前来迎接并把她们领进了她们的房间。十分钟后，她带着孩子下了楼，在旅馆登记簿上签名。她穿着一套脖领和袖口处饰有白色褶边的很合身的黑衣服。她一头褐色的头发，编着辫子，并且系了个黑蝴蝶结。她的脸色异常苍白，左边脸颊上还有颗小小的痣。</td>
		<td class="en">We dissipated the day in valid speculations.Decided it was too warm to walk in the afternoon, so lay down on our beds, mustering in great force for afternoon coffee.And a carriage drew up at the door.A tall young girl got out, leading a child by the hand.They entered the hall, were greeted and shown to their room.Ten minutes later she came down with the child to sign the visitors’ book.She wore a black, closely fitting dress, touched at throat and wrists with white frilling.Her brown hair, braided, was tied with a black bow—unusually pale, with a small mole on her left cheek.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是冯•高尔男爵夫人的妹妹。”她说，还一边在吸墨纸上试钢笔，一边朝我们蔑视地笑了笑。即使对于我们当中最迟钝的人来说，生活中也会有令人激动的时刻。不到两个月，居然就有两位男爵夫人光临此地！经理立刻离开房间去找一个新笔尖。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am the Baroness von Gall’s sister,” she said, trying the pen on a piece of blotting-paper, and smiling at us deprecatingly.Even for the most jaded of us life holds its thrilling moments.Two Baronesses in two months!The manager immediately left the room to find a new nib.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我这个平民眼里，那个病孩子一点都不好看。她那样子就像是被人不断地同一个蓝色袋子一起洗过一样。头发就像灰色的羊毛，身上的围涎也被浆得硬邦邦的。她只能隔着褶边窥视我们——褶边隔开了她与这个世界！也许指望高贵的姨妈像婢女一样去清洗她外甥女的耳朵根本就是一种奢望。可是我觉得，最让人沮丧的东西就是一个哑巴外甥女的脏耳朵了。</td>
		<td class="en">To my plebeian eyes that afflicted child was singularly unattractive.She had the air of having been perpetually washed with a blue bag, and hair like grey wool—dressed, too, in a pinafore so stiffly starched that she could only peer at us over the frill of it—a social barrier of a pinafore—and perhaps it was too much to expect a noble aunt to attend to the menial consideration of her niece’s ears.But a dumb niece with unwashed ears struck me as a most depressing object.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们被安排在餐桌的上座。顿时，我们都茫然地面面相觑。接着，奥伯雷吉龙施特拉太太说：</td>
		<td class="en">They were given places at the head of the table.For a moment we all looked at one another with an eena-deena-dina-do expression.Then the Frau Oberregierungsrat:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我希望您旅行后没有觉得太累。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I hope you are not tired after your journey.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不累。”男爵夫人的妹妹望着杯子微笑着说。</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” said the sister of the Baroness, smiling into her cup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我希望这个可爱的孩子也不觉得累。”博士太太说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I hope the dear child is not tired,” said the Frau Doktor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一点也不累。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not at all.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我真的希望您今晚能睡个好觉。”奥伯雷吉龙施特拉先生恭敬地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I expect, I hope you will sleep well to-night,” the Herr Oberlehrer said reverently.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“会的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >来自慕尼黑的那位诗人两眼直勾勾地一直望着她们。他颇为深情地望着她们，任由领带吸掉杯中的那一大半咖啡。</td>
		<td class="en">The poet from Munich never took his eyes off the pair.He allowed his tie to absorb most of his coffee while he gazed at them exceedingly soulfully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在想：奔放的诗情。他的《孤独颂》，咏的必是死亡的痉挛！那位年轻女子很有可能激起了他的灵感，更不用说他也会把这献给她。从那一刻起，他那苦痛的气质就找到了温床并且活动了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Unyoking Pegasus, thought I.Death spasms of his Odes to Solitude!There were possibilities in that young woman for an inspiration, not to mention a dedication, and from that moment his suffering temperament took up its bed and walked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >饭后，她们就回屋休息去了，我们则悠闲地聊起她们来。</td>
		<td class="en">They retired after the meal, leaving us to discuss them at leisure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她们俩长得真像，”博士太太若有所思地说，“相当像。她举止多么端庄，多么贤淑，对孩子又那么温和。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There is a likeness,” mused the Frau Doktor. “Quite. What a manner she has. Such reserve, such a tender way with the child.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可惜她还得照顾那个孩子。”来自波恩的那个学生大声喊道。他向来都是用三块伤疤和一条勋表来引起人们的注意。可是要想吸引男爵夫人妹妹的注意，这些是远远不够的。</td>
		<td class="en">“Pity she has the child to attend to,” exclaimed the student from Bonn.He had hitherto relied upon three scars and a ribbon to produce an effect, but the sister of a Baroness demanded more than these.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一连好多天，大家的注意力都集中在这位妹妹身上。要不是她生得那么漂亮，我们才不会忍受这种对她的喋喋不休的议论、对她歌声的赞美以及对她言行举止的详尽叙述。但是她亲切地包容了我们所有人的崇拜，因而我们也就十分心满意足了。</td>
		<td class="en">Absorbing days followed.Had she been one whit less beautifully born we could not have endured the continual conversation about her, the songs in her praise, the detailed account of her movements.But she graciously suffered our worship and we were more than content.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她把那位诗人当作她的知己。大家出去散步的时候，他就会帮她捧着书。他还托着那个病孩子在他的膝上蹦上蹦下——这是诗的破格。一天早晨，他带着笔记本来到了大厅，还给我们读诗听。</td>
		<td class="en">The poet she took into her confidence.He carried her books when we went walking, he jumped the afflicted one on his knee—poetic licence, this—and one morning brought his notebook into the salon and read to us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“男爵夫人的妹妹告诉我，她确定要进修道院了。”他说，(这个消息使得来自波恩的学生立刻就站起身来。)“昨天夜里，在那静谧甜美的空气中，我凭窗写了这几行诗……”</td>
		<td class="en">“The sister of the Baroness has assured me she is going into a convent,” he said.(That made the student from Bonn sit up.) “I have written these few lines last night from my window in the sweet night air—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，你真是心思细腻啊。”博士太太说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, your DELICATE chest,” commented the Frau Doktor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他冷冷地看了她一眼，弄得她的脸涨得通红。</td>
		<td class="en">He fixed a stony eye on her, and she blushed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是这么写的：</td>
		<td class="en">“I have written these lines:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘啊，你要飞向修道院吗？可是你那么年轻、鲜艳、美丽，像田间的雌鹿一样跳跃吧，在那里找寻你的美吧。’”</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Ah, will you to a convent fly, So young, so fresh, so fair?Spring like a doe upon the fields And find your beauty there.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >九节同样可爱的诗里，诗人怂恿男爵夫人的妹妹做出同样极端的举动。我敢保证，要是她真的接受了他的建议，即使她在修道院里度过余生，这也不会让她有足够的时间歇过气来。</td>
		<td class="en">Nine verses equally lovely commanded her to equally violent action.I am certain that had she followed his advice not even the remainder of her life in a convent would have given her time to recover her breath.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我已经送给了她一份诗稿，”他说，“而且我们今天还打算到树林里去采些野花。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have presented her with a copy,” he said.“And to-day we are going to look for wild flowers in the wood.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >来自波恩的那个学生站起来走出了房间。我央求诗人再把他的诗朗诵一遍。在第六个诗节结束的时候，我透过窗子看到男爵夫人的妹妹和那位有伤疤的小伙子走出正门消失了。这使得我可以殷勤地感谢他答应为我另抄一份。</td>
		<td class="en">The student from Bonn got up and left the room.I begged the poet to repeat the verses once more.At the end of the sixth verse I saw from the window the sister of the Baroness and the scarred youth disappearing through the front gate, which enabled me to thank the poet so charmingly that he offered to write me out a copy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是那阵子我们一直生活在巨大的压力之下。把一家粗陋的公寓一下子变成豪华的府邸，我们怎么能不垮下来呢？快到傍晚时，博士太太来我的书房找我，跟我说了些知心话。</td>
		<td class="en">But we were living at too high pressure in those days.Swinging from our humble pension to the high walls of palaces, how could we help but fall?Late one afternoon the Frau Doktor came upon me in the writing-room and took me to her bosom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她一直在跟我聊她生活的点点滴滴，”博士太太悄悄地跟我说，“她来到我的卧室还要给我按摩胳膊。你知道，我一直在受风湿病的折磨。而且，你想，现在已经有六个人向她求婚啦。我敢说我都哭了，他们个个条件都那么好，而且还都是名门望族。天哪，最美好的一次求婚是在树林里。我倒不是认为不应该在客厅里求婚——四面都有墙，显得更正式——但那是片隐蔽的树林。那位年轻的军官说，她就像是一株从未被男人粗糙的手碰触过的幼树。多娇嫩精致啊！”她叹了口气，两眼朝上看着。</td>
		<td class="en">“She has been telling me all about her life,” whispered the Frau Doktor.“She came to my bedroom and offered to massage my arm.You know, I am the greatest martyr to rheumatism.And, fancy now, she has already had six proposals of marriage.Such beautiful offers that I assure you I wept—and every one of noble birth.My dear, the most beautiful was in the wood.Not that I do not think a proposal should take place in a drawing-room—it is more fitting to have four walls—but this was a private wood.He said, the young officer, she was like a young tree whose branches had never been touched by the ruthless hand of man.Such delicacy!”She sighed and turned up her eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然了，对于你们英国人来说，这可能有些难以理解。在板球场上你们英国人总是露着双腿，而且你们还在后院养狗。太可惜了！年轻人就该像野玫瑰一样。我真是一点也搞不懂你们的女人到底是怎么嫁出去的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Of course it is difficult for you English to understand when you are always exposing your legs on cricket-fields, and breeding dogs in your back gardens.The pity of it!Youth should be like a wild rose.For myself I do not understand how your women ever get married at all.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她使劲地摇了摇头，弄得我也跟着摇起头来，顿时一丝愁绪笼罩了我的心头。看来我们的情况确实是很糟糕。难道浪漫的精灵只在德国贵族的头顶上舞动她那玫瑰色的翅膀吗？</td>
		<td class="en">She shook her head so violently that I shook mine too, and a gloom settled round my heart.It seemed we were really in a very bad way.Did the spirit of romance spread her rose wings only over aristocratic Germany?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我走进自己的房间，把一块桃红色头巾扎在头上，手里拿着一本莫里克的抒情诗，来到了花园里。凉亭后面长着一大丛紫丁香。我在那里坐了下来。博士太太刚才委婉地向我暗示，我该穿件半丧服。从她的话里，我感到了些许伤感的意味。我自己也开始写起诗来。</td>
		<td class="en">I went to my room, bound a pink scarf about my hair, and took a volume of Morike’s lyrics into the garden.A great bush of purple lilac grew behind the summer-house.There I sat down, finding a sad significance in the delicate suggestion of half mourning.I began to write a poem myself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们梦幻般地摇摆着，苦苦思念着；而我们紧紧拥抱，在那里接吻。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They sway and languish dreamily, And we, close pressed, are kissing there.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >写完啦！“紧紧拥抱”听起来毫无新意。透出一股衣柜的气味。难道我的野玫瑰已经蔓生在尘土中了吗？我嚼着一片叶子，双手抱着膝盖。这时候，就跟变魔术似的，我突然听到凉亭里有人在说话——是男爵夫人的妹妹和那个来自波恩的学生。</td>
		<td class="en">It ended!“Close pressed” did not sound at all fascinating.Savoured of wardrobes.Did my wild rose then already trail in the dust?I chewed a leaf and hugged my knees.Then—magic moment—I heard voices from the summer-house, the sister of the Baroness and the student from Bonn.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >间接听到总比听不到强，于是我竖起了耳朵。</td>
		<td class="en">Second-hand was better than nothing; I pricked up my ears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的手是多么小巧啊，”来自波恩的学生说，“它们就像一对白百合花一样躺在你这黑裙子的水池里。”这话听起来倒是真的。我对那位出身高贵的小姐的回答倒是很感兴趣。她只是表示同感地低语了一声。</td>
		<td class="en">“What small hands you have,” said the student from Bonn.“They are like white lilies lying in the pool of your black dress.”This certainly sounded the real thing.Her high-born reply was what interested me.Sympathetic murmur only.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我可以握一下你的一只手吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“May I hold one?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我听到了两声叹息——估计他们的手已经握在了一起——他扰乱了一个高贵胸膛里的那片黑暗的水。</td>
		<td class="en">I heard two sighs—presumed they held—he had rifled those dark waters of a noble blossom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看看，跟你的手指相比，我的是多么粗大啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Look at my great fingers beside yours.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是你的手指保养得也很好啊。”男爵夫人的妹妹羞答答地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“But they are beautifully kept,” said the sister of the Baroness shyly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好一个轻佻的女子！难道谈情说爱要看指甲修剪得如何吗？</td>
		<td class="en">The minx!Was love then a question of manicure?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是多么渴望能吻吻你啊，”学生喃喃地说，“但是你也知道，我正患有严重的鼻粘膜炎，我怕会传染给你。我数了一下，就光昨天晚上我就打了十六个喷嚏，用了三个不同的手帕。”</td>
		<td class="en">“How I should adore to kiss you,” murmured the student.“But you know I am suffering from severe nasal catarrh, and I dare not risk giving it to you.Sixteen times last night did I count myself sneezing. And three different handkerchiefs.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我把莫里克诗集丢进丁香花丛里就回公寓去了。大门外边，一辆大汽车嘶嘶地排着气。大厅里面一片骚动。男爵夫人出乎意料地来看她的小女儿来了。她穿着黄色的防水外衣，站在大厅中央，正在向经理问一些问题。公寓里所有的客人都围在她跟前，连博士太太也假装来查看一张时间表，以尽可能地凑近那令人敬畏的下摆。</td>
		<td class="en">I threw Morike into the lilac bush, and went back to the house.A great automobile snorted at the front door.In the salon great commotion.The Baroness was paying a surprise visit to her little daughter.Clad in a yellow mackintosh she stood in the middle of the room questioning the manager.And every guest the pension contained was grouped about her, even the Frau Doktor, presumably examining a timetable, as near to the august skirts as possible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可我的女仆呢？”男爵夫人质问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“But where is my maid?” asked the Baroness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您的女仆没有来，”经理回答道，“只有您优雅的妹妹和女儿在这里。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There was no maid,” replied the manager, “save for your gracious sister and daughter.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“妹妹！”她尖声喊道，“胡说！我哪有什么妹妹。我的孩子是跟我的裁缝的女儿一起来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sister!” she cried sharply.“Fool, I have no sister.My child travelled with the daughter of my dressmaker.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这可真是壮观啊！</td>
		<td class="en">Tableau grandissimo!</td></tr>
