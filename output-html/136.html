		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现今所有的婴孩在大多数场合下，特别是在他们根本不该说话的场合下，喜欢说出一些“妙语”，这十分无礼，也令人厌恶。从一些通常刊登出来的妙语样本来看，正在成长的这一代孩子比白痴好不到哪里去。而且，他们的父母和孩子相比，也肯定好不到哪里去，因为在大部分情况下，父母会把小婴孩突然冒出的一些幼稚愚蠢的话拿去发表，让我们在阅读期刊杂志时，感到眼花缭乱。我说这话时，可能带有一些情绪，更不用说还有一丝个人的厌恶之情；我确实承认，这些日子，当听说了这么多有天赋的婴孩的故事，我感到坐立不安，记得当我还是孩子的时候，我很少说出什么妙语。我试过一两次，但并不受欢迎。我的家人没有期待我说出什么妙语，所以他们有时候就斥责我，其余的时候，就打我屁股。不过，一想到要是我父亲听到我胆敢说出当今这些“四岁孩子”说的一些妙语，我会落个什么下场，我就毛骨悚然、不寒而栗。他认为，干脆活生生地扒了我的皮，尽他最终应尽的职责，这对于我这么罪恶的一个小东西，就是一种可耻的仁慈。他是一个严肃刻板、不苟言笑的人，厌恶所有形式的早熟。如果我说过我前面提到的一些话，并且说的时候被他听到了，那他一定会杀了我。他会的，真会。要是有机会，他一定会这么做的。不过没机会了，因为我的判断力足以使我先服下士的宁，再说些妙语。我清清白白的人生档案，就被这一句双关语玷污了。父亲无意中听到了那句话，找了四五个小镇，想要拿我的小命。要是我已经长大成人，他这样做当然是对的；但是，我还是个孩子，我哪里知道我做了一件多坏的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">All infants appear to have an impertinent and disagreeable fashion nowadays of saying “smart” things on most occasions that offer, and especially on occasions when they ought not to be saying anything at all.Judging by the average published specimens of smart sayings, the rising generation of children are little better than idiots.And the parents must surely be but little better than the children, for in most cases they are the publishers of the sunbursts of infantile imbecility which dazzle us from the pages of our periodicals.I may seem to speak with some heat, not to say a suspicion of personal spite; and I do admit that it nettles me to hear about so many gifted infants in these days, and remember that I seldom said anything smart when I was a child.I tried it once or twice, but it was not popular.The family were not expecting brilliant remarks from me, and so they snubbed me sometimes and spanked me the rest.But it makes my flesh creep and my blood run cold to think what might have happened to me if I had dared to utter some of the smart things of this generation’s “four-year-olds” where my father could hear me.To have simply skinned me alive and considered his duty at an end would have seemed to him criminal leniency toward one so sinning.He was a stern, unsmiling man, and hated all forms of precocity.If I had said some of the things I have referred to, and said them in his hearing, he would have destroyed me.He would, indeed.He would, provided the opportunity remained with him.But it would not, for I would have had judgment enough to take some strychnine first and say my smart thing afterward.The fair record of my life has been tarnished by just one pun.My father overheard that, and he hunted me over four or five townships seeking to take my life.If I had been full-grown, of course he would have been right; but, child as I was, I could not know how wicked a thing I had done.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我之前说过一句人们通常所称的“妙语”，但不是双关语。不过，这句话还是差点儿给我和父亲的感情带来了严重的裂痕。当时在场的有我父亲、母亲、我的叔叔伊弗雷姆和他的妻子，还有其他一两个人，说着说着，他们就说到了给我取个名字。我躺在那里，摆弄各种样式的橡皮圈，并且试图选出一个，因为我已经厌倦了咬别人的手指，想抓住一些能够让我快点把事情弄完的东西，然后我就能得到其他东西。你可曾注意到咬奶妈的手指有多么恶心，或试图啃自己的大脚趾头有多累、多无聊？难道你从来没有失去耐心，早在你的牙还没长到一半的时候，就希望它们滚得远远的？对我来说，这些事情就好像是昨天发生的。对一些孩子来说，事情确实是这样的。不过我跑题了。我还是躺在那里，摆弄着我的橡皮圈。我记得我盯着钟看，注意到还有一个小时二十五分钟，我就两个星期大了。我觉得自己没有做什么，不应得到他们如此慷慨地给予我的祝福。我父亲说：“亚伯拉罕是个好名字。我祖父就叫亚伯拉罕。”</td>
		<td class="en">I made one of those remarks ordinarily called “smart things” before that, but it was not a pun.Still, it came near causing a serious rupture between my father and myself.My father and mother, my uncle Ephraim and his wife, and one or two others were present, and the conversation turned on a name for me.I was lying there trying some India-rubber rings of various patterns, and endeavoring to make a selection, for I was tired of trying to cut my teeth on people’s fingers, and wanted to get hold of something that would enable me to hurry the thing through and get something else.Did you ever notice what a nuisance it was cutting your teeth on your nurse’s finger, or how back-breaking and tiresome it was trying to cut them on your big toe?And did you never get out of patience and wish your teeth were in Jerico long before you got them half cut?To me it seems as if these things happened yesterday.And they did, to some children.But I digress.I was lying there trying the India-rubber rings.I remember looking at the clock and noticing that in an hour and twenty-five minutes I would be two weeks old, and thinking how little I had done to merit the blessings that were so unsparingly lavished upon me.My father said: “Abraham is a good name.My grandfather was named Abraham.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母亲说：“亚伯拉罕是个好名字。非常好。那咱们就用亚伯拉罕当他的一个名字吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">My mother said: “Abraham is a good name.Very well.Let us have Abraham for one of his names.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >父亲皱了皱眉，母亲看起来很高兴；婶婶说道：“多可爱的小宝宝！”</td>
		<td class="en">My father frowned, my mother looked pleased; my aunt said: “What a little darling it is!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >父亲说：“艾萨克是个好名字，雅各布也是个好名字。”</td>
		<td class="en">My father said: “Isaac is a good name, and Jacob is a good name.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母亲十分赞同，说道：“没有比这更好的名字了。咱们把艾萨克和雅各布都加到他的名字里。”</td>
		<td class="en">My mother assented, and said: “No names are better.Let us add Isaac and Jacob to his names.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我说：“好吧。艾萨克和雅各布作为我的名字，真是好听。麻烦把拨浪鼓给我。我不能整天咬橡皮圈。”</td>
		<td class="en">I said: “All right.Isaac and Jacob are good enough for yours truly.Pass me that rattle, if you please.I can’t chew India-rubber rings all day.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没一个人弄个备忘录，把我的这些话记录下来，然后拿去发表。我看出来了，我只能自己去记，要不然这些话会被彻底忘光。因此，在智力发展过程中，我不仅完全没有像其他小孩那样得到慷慨的鼓励，相反，现在父亲生气地对我阴沉着脸，母亲看上去既伤心又不安，即使是婶婶，看上去似乎也觉得我可能做得太过分了。我恶狠狠地咬了一口橡皮圈，还偷偷地敲碎了猫头上方的拨浪鼓，却什么也没有说。不一会儿，父亲说：</td>
		<td class="en">Not a soul made a memorandum of these sayings of mine, for publication.I saw that, and did it myself, else they would have been utterly lost.So far from meeting with a generous encouragement like other children when developing intellectually, I was now furiously scowled upon by my father; my mother looked grieved and anxious, and even my aunt had about her an expression of seeming to think that maybe I had gone too far.I took a vicious bite out of an India-rubber ring, and covertly broke the rattle over the kitten’s head, but said nothing.Presently my father said: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“塞缪尔这个名字极好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Samuel is a very excellent name.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我知道麻烦来了。什么也阻止不了。我放下拨浪鼓，把叔叔的银表、衣刷、玩具狗、我的锡制士兵、肉豆蔻擦菜板，还有其他东西扔到摇篮一边。我平时习惯仔细检查这些东西，对着它们深思，并用它们弄出动听悦耳的声音；当我需要什么有益的消遣时，我会摔、打、砸这些东西。接着，我穿上我的小风衣，戴上小绒帽，一手提着自己的袖珍小鞋，另一只手拿着甘草精，从摇篮里爬出来，爬到地上。我对自己说，现在，即使事情变得更糟，我也准备好了。然后我用一种坚决的口吻大声说道：“父亲，我不同意，我绝不能要塞缪尔这个名字。”</td>
		<td class="en">I saw that trouble was coming.Nothing could prevent it.I laid down my rattle; over the side of the cradle I dropped my uncle’s silver watch, the clothes-brush, the toy dog, my tin soldier, the nutmeg-grater, and other matters which I was accustomed to examine, and meditate upon and make pleasant noises with, and bang and batter and break when I needed wholesome entertainment.Then I put on my little frock and my little bonnet, and took my pygmy shoes in one hand and my licorice in the other, and climbed out on the floor.I said to myself, Now, if the worse comes to worst, I am ready.Then I said aloud, in a firm voice: “Father, I cannot, cannot wear the name of Samuel.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的儿子！”</td>
		<td class="en">“My son!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“父亲，我是说真的。我真不能用。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Father, I mean it.I cannot.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“父亲，我对那个名字有一种无法克服的憎恶之情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Father, I have an invincible antipathy to that name.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的儿子，这没道理。很多伟人和好人都叫塞缪尔。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My son, this is unreasonable.Many great and good men have been named Samuel.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“先生，我得听听您举个例子。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sir, I have yet to hear of the first instance.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么！有个叫塞缪尔的先知。难道他不是伟人、好人吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What!There was Samuel the prophet.Was not he great and good?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一般般。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not so very.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的儿子！上帝亲口这么叫他的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My son!With His own voice the Lord called him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，先生，上帝要叫他好几遍，他才过来！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, sir, and had to call him a couple times before he could come!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说完我就冲了出去，那个死板的老头儿也冲出去追我。第二天中午，他抓到了我，谈话结束后，我有了塞缪尔这个名字，同时也遭到了一顿痛打，并得到了一些有用的信息；经过这种妥协，父亲的怒气平息了，一场误会消除了，而如果我选择无理抵抗，这场误会就可能演变成永久的裂痕。不过仅仅根据这个小插曲来判断，如果父亲听到我说一句现在的报纸上印的那些“两岁婴孩”说的话——那些乏味、让人恶心的话，他又会怎么惩罚我呢？要我说，我们家肯定会发生一起杀婴案。</td>
		<td class="en">And then I sallied forth, and that stern old man sallied forth after me.He overtook me at noon the following day, and when the interview was over I had acquired the name of Samuel, and a thrashing, and other useful information; and by means of this compromise my father’s wrath was appeased and a misunderstanding bridged over which might have become a permanent rupture if I had chosen to be unreasonable.But just judging by this episode, what would my father have done to me if I had ever uttered in his hearing one of the flat, sickly things these “two-years-olds” say in print nowadays?In my opinion there would have been a case of infanticide in our family.</td></tr>
