		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡特·沃森胳膊下夹着一本当期的杂志，一路慢慢踱着，同时好奇地四处张望。从他上次走过这条街算起，都过去二十多年了；这里变化极大，令人咋舌。这个现在有三十万人口的西部城市当年只有三万人，那时他还只是个孩子，常常在各条街上闲逛。他现在所在的这条街，当时是个安静的住宅区，周围都住着令人尊敬的劳工阶层家庭。这天傍晚，他发现这条街已经淹没在一大片肮脏的奢靡场所之下了。到处都是中国人和日本人开的店，还有脏乱的人家，跟下等白人娱乐场和酒馆混杂在一起。他幼年时那条安静的街道，已经变成全城最可怕的地区了。</td>
		<td class="en">Carter Watson, a current magazine under his arm, strolled slowly along, gazing about him curiously.Twenty years had elapsed since he had been on this particular street, and the changes were great and stupefying.This Western city of three hundred thousand souls had contained but thirty thousand, when, as a boy, he had been wont to ramble along its streets.In those days the street he was now on had been a quiet residence street in the respectable workingclass quarter.On this late afternoon he found that it had been submerged by a vast and vicious tenderloin.Chinese and Japanese shops and dens abounded, all confusedly intermingled with low white resorts and boozing dens.This quiet street of his youth had become the toughest quarter of the city.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他看了看表。时间是五点半。他非常清楚，这是这个地区一天中最冷清的时候，不过他很好奇，还是想瞧一瞧。二十年来，他四处游历，研究世界各地人间百态，而在他的记忆里，他的故乡是个亲切可爱、身心皆宜的地方。他所看到的变化还真是令人吃惊。他打定主意接着走下去，看一看他的故乡堕落到了何等地步。</td>
		<td class="en">He looked at his watch.It was half-past five.It was the slack time of the day in such a region, as he well knew, yet he was curious to see.In all his score of years of wandering and studying social conditions over the world, he had carried with him the memory of his old town as a sweet and wholesome place.The metamorphosis he now beheld was startling.He certainly must continue his stroll and glimpse the infamy to which his town had descended.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还有一件事：卡特·沃森有非常强烈的社会和公民意识。他很富有，不用依靠别人；他厌恶把精力浪费在午后茶会和怪诞的宴饮上的社交生活，对女演员、赛马和其他的消遣也没什么兴趣。他热衷于研究道德问题，自命为改革家，虽然他的工作主要是给一些比较严肃的评论杂志和季刊写稿，以他的名字出版一些明智、敏锐的关于工人阶级和贫民窟居民的专著。他所写的二十七部著作冠以这样一些标题：《如果基督来到新奥尔良》、《筋疲力尽的工人》、《柏林的出租屋改革》、《英格兰的农村贫民区》、《东区的人民》、《改革还是革命》、《大学区——激进主义的温床》，以及《文明社会中的穴居人》等等。</td>
		<td class="en">Another thing: Carter Watson had a keen social and civic consciousness.Independently wealthy, he had been loath to dissipate his energies in the pink teas and freak dinners of society, while actresses, race-horses, and kindred diversions had left him cold.He had the ethical bee in his bonnet and was a reformer of no mean pretension, though his work had been mainly in the line of contributions to the heavier reviews and quarterlies and to the publication over his name of brightly, cleverly written books on the working classes and the slum-dwellers.Among the twenty-seven to his credit occurred titles such as, “If Christ Came to New Orleans,” “The Worked-out Worker,” “Tenement Reform in Berlin,” “The Rural Slums of England,” “The people of the East Side,” “Reform Versus Revolution,” “The University Settlement as a Hot Bed of Radicalism’ and “The Cave Man of Civilization.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，卡特·沃森并不病态，也不狂热。当他遇到可怕的现象，进行研究和揭露时，他并不会失去理智。他身上找不出丝毫容易激动的特征。这得益于他的幽默感、广泛的阅历和保守的哲学家气质。对闪电式改革理论他可没有耐心听下去。在他看来，社会只有经过极其缓慢和极其痛苦的演化过程，才能变好。没有捷径，也没有突然出现的重生。人类的改良只能在痛苦和悲哀中完成，如同过去一切社会改良的历程一样。</td>
		<td class="en">But Carter Watson was neither morbid nor fanatic.He did not lose his head over the horrors he encountered, studied, and exposed.No hair brained enthusiasm branded him.His humor saved him, as did his wide experience and his con. conservative philosophic temperament.Nor did he have any patience with lightning change reform theories.As he saw it, society would grow better only through the painfully slow and arduously painful processes of evolution.There were no short cuts, no sudden regenerations.The betterment of mankind must be worked out in agony and misery just as all past social betterments had been worked out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但在这个夏日的傍晚，卡特·沃森感到很好奇。他走着走着，在一家艳俗的酒吧门前停下了。头顶的招牌上写着：“凡登酒吧”。入口有两个。一个明显是进这家酒吧的。这条路他没有走。另一个是一条狭窄的过道。走过过道，他走进了一间很大的屋子，里面摆着很多用椅子围起来的桌子，但是明显无人光顾。借着昏暗的灯光，他看到远远地放着一架钢琴。他心里想着以后还要再来一次，研究一下坐在这么多桌子旁边喝酒的人都是些什么阶级，然后就在屋子里兜了一圈。</td>
		<td class="en">But on this late summer afternoon, Carter Watson was curious.As he moved along he paused before a gaudy drinking place.The sign above read, “The Vendome.”There were two entrances.One evidently led to the bar.This he did not explore.The other was a narrow hallway.Passing through this he found himself in a huge room, filled with chair-encircled tables and quite deserted.In the dim light he made out a piano in the distance.Making a mental note that he would come back some time and study the class of persons that must sit and drink at those multitudinous tables, he proceeded to circumnavigate the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >屋子的后面有一条很短的过道，通往一个小厨房。厨房里，凡登酒吧的老板帕茨·霍兰，正独自坐在一张桌子旁，在晚上的生意还没有忙起来前，匆匆吃着晚饭。帕齐·霍兰今天逮谁跟谁生气。他一早上起来就心情欠佳，一天之中事事都不如意。要是有人问他酒吧里的伙计，他们一定会说老板在闹脾气。但是卡特·沃森并不知道这些。当他走过那个小小的过道的时候，帕齐·霍兰那双怒气冲冲的眼睛一下子就看到了他夹着的那本杂志。帕齐·霍兰并不认识卡特·沃森，他也并不知道沃森夹着的是一本杂志。帕齐窝着一肚子火气，认定这个陌生人是那种到处张贴广告，把他后房的墙上弄得乌七八糟的人。杂志封面的颜色更使他确定这就是那种花花绿绿的广告。于是，麻烦开始了。帕茨手里拿着刀叉，朝卡特·沃森扑了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, at the rear, a short hallway led off to a small kitchen, and here, at a table, alone, sat Patsy Horan, proprietor of the Vendome, consuming a hasty supper ere the evening rush of business.Also, Patsy Horan was angry with the world.He had got out of the wrong side of bed that morning, and nothing had gone right all day.Had his barkeepers been asked, they would have described his mental condition as a grouch.But Carter Watson did not know this.As he passed the little hallway, Patsy Horan’s sullen eyes lighted on the magazine he carried under his arm.Patsy did not know Carter Watson, nor did he know that what he carried under his arm was a magazine.Patsy, out of the depths of his grouch, decided that this stranger was one of those pests who marred and scarred the walls of his back rooms by tacking up or pasting up advertisements.The color on the front cover of the magazine convinced him that it was such an advertisement.Thus the trouble began.Knife and fork in hand, Patsy leaped for Carter Watson.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“给我滚开！”帕齐大喊大叫，“我知道你要干嘛！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Out wid yeh!”Patsy bellowed.“I know yer game!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡特·华森吓了一跳。这个冲过来的人就像掀开盖子就会蹦出来的玩偶。</td>
		<td class="en">Carter Watson was startled.The man had come upon him like the eruption of a jack-in-the-box.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“又来弄脏我的墙。”帕齐喊道，同时吐出一连串生动、肮脏、毫不阳刚的咒骂。</td>
		<td class="en">“A defacin’ me walls,” cried Patsy, at the same time emitting a string of vivid and vile, rather than virile, epithets of opprobrium.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果鄙人有所冒犯，绝非故意……”</td>
		<td class="en">“If I have given any offense I did not mean to—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位来客只能说到这里了，因为帕齐打断了他。</td>
		<td class="en">But that was as far as the visitor got.Patsy interrupted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“给我滚开，你他妈怎么那么多话。”帕齐说着，挥舞着刀叉来增强他骂人的声势。</td>
		<td class="en">“Get out wid yeh; yeh talk too much wid yer mouth,” quoted Patsy, emphasizing his remarks with flourishes of the knife and fork.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡特·沃森脑中闪过一幅图景，好像那把叉子已经怪不舒服地插进了他的肋骨。他知道这种情况下莽夫才会再说下去，于是马上转身准备离开。他软弱的退却看来是更加激怒了帕齐·霍兰，因为这位有头有脸的人物丢下了刀叉，一下跳到他面前。</td>
		<td class="en">Carter Watson caught a quick vision of that eating-fork inserted uncomfortably between his ribs, knew that it would be rash to talk further with his mouth, and promptly turned to go.The sight of his meekly retreating back must have further enraged Patsy Horan, for that worthy, dropping the table implements, sprang upon him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >帕齐有一百八十磅重。沃森也差不多。体重上两人旗鼓相当。但是帕齐是一个鲁莽好斗、习惯乱战的酒店打手，而沃森是一位拳击手。在技术上，沃森占优，因为帕齐暴露着正面要害就冲了过来，只顾着抡起右拳狠命打来。沃森只要从左面给他一记直拳，就可以脱身。不过，沃森还有一个占优的地方。他的拳术、他探访各地贫民窟的经验都告诉他要克制。</td>
		<td class="en">Patsy weighed one hundred and eighty pounds.So did Watson.In this they were equal.But Patsy was a rushing, rough-and-tumble saloon-fighter, while Watson was a boxer.In this the latter had the advantage, for Patsy came in wide open, swinging his right in a perilous sweep.All Watson had to do was to straight-left him and escape.But Watson had another advantage.His boxing, and his experience in the slums and ghettos of the world, had taught him restraint.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他没有挥拳，只是踮步一闪，躲过对方的拳头，跟对方扭在一起。但是像公牛一样扑过来的帕齐有一股冲力，而侧身制住他的沃森没有冲力。结果，这两个加起来三百六十磅的人轰然倒地，沃森给压在下面。他躺在地上，脑袋顶着这个大房间的后墙。街道远在一百五十英尺开外，他迅速地想了想。他首先想到的是避免麻烦。他可不希望自己的名字登在报纸上，这里是他童年的故乡，很多亲戚和故旧还住在这里。</td>
		<td class="en">He pivoted on his feet, and, instead of striking, ducked the other’s swinging blow and went into a clinch.But Patsy, charging like a bull, had the momentum of his rush, while Watson, whirling to meet him, had no momentum.As a result, the pair of them went down, with all their three hundred and sixty pounds of weight, in a long crashing fall, Watson underneath.He lay with his head touching the rear wall of the large room.The street was a hundred and fifty feet away, and he did some quick thinking.His first thought was to avoid trouble.He had no wish to get into the papers of this, his childhood town, where many of his relatives and family friends still lived.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，他扣紧双臂，把压在他身上的人牢牢抱住，等着解救的人来——他们摔倒的声音很响，一定有人会循声而来的。解救的人真的来了——从酒吧里出来六个人，在他们面前围成一个半圆。</td>
		<td class="en">So it was that he locked his arms around the man on top of him, held him close, and waited for the help to come that must come in response to the crash of the fall.The help came—that is, six men ran in from the bar and formed about in a semi-circle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把他拉开，伙计们。”沃森说，“我没有打他，我也不想打架。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Take him off, fellows,” Watson said.“I haven’t struck him, and I don’t want any fight.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是那半个圆圈里没人吭声。沃森就继续抱着，等着。帕齐想尽办法都没法弄伤他，就做了个提议。</td>
		<td class="en">But the semi-circle remained silent.Watson held on and waited.Patsy, after various vain efforts to inflict damage, made an overture.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“放开我，我就放你离开。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Leggo o’ me an’ I’ll get off o’ yeh,” said he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃森放开了他，但是帕齐一挣扎着站起来，就居高临下地站到他躺着的对手面前，准备再打。</td>
		<td class="en">Watson let go, but when Patsy scrambled to his feet he stood over his recumbent foe, ready to strike.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“起来！”帕齐命令道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Get up,” Patsy commanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的声音严厉、凶恶，就像上帝唤人前去接受审判的口气一样。沃森知道，他是不会手下留情的。</td>
		<td class="en">His voice was stern and implacable, like the voice of God calling to judgment, and Watson knew there was no mercy there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你往后站，我就起来。”他反抗道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Stand back and I’ll get up,” he countered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你要是个爷们儿，就站起来。”帕齐说道，他浅蓝的眼睛里简直要喷出怒火来，拳头随时准备送出死命的一击。</td>
		<td class="en">“If yer a gentleman, get up,” quoth Patsy, his pale blue eyes aflame with wrath, his fist ready for a crushing blow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时，他一收脚，朝沃森脸上踢了过来。沃森交叉双臂，挡住了这一脚，然后极其迅速地跳了起来，趁对方还没来得及出拳的时候，就又扭住了他。沃森抱住帕齐，对围观的人说：</td>
		<td class="en">At the same moment he drew his foot back to kick the other in the face.Watson blocked the kick with his crossed arms and sprang to his feet so quickly that he was in a clinch with his antagonist before the latter could strike.Holding him, Watson spoke to the onlookers:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把他拉开，伙计们。你们都看见了，我并没有打他。我不想打架。我要离开这儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Take him away from me, fellows.You see I am not striking him.I don’t want to fight.I want to get out of here.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那一圈人既不动弹，也不说话。这样的沉默可不是什么好兆头，沃森的心感到一阵凉意。</td>
		<td class="en">The circle did not move nor speak.Its silence was ominous and sent a chill to Watson’s heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >帕齐试图甩翻沃森，反被沃森弄得仰面朝天摔到地上。摆脱了帕齐，沃森立即跳起来，向门口奔去。但是那圈人像墙一样横在他面前。他看到那些脸都苍白不堪，是从来都见不着太阳的那种脸色；他知道，挡住他去路的，都是些在这片城市丛林中偷鸡摸狗、为非作歹之辈。他们把沃森推回了像公牛一样追打过来的帕齐面前。</td>
		<td class="en">Patsy made an effort to throw him, which culminated in his putting Patsy on his back.Tearing loose from him, Watson sprang to his feet and made for the door.But the circle of men was interposed a wall.He noticed the white, pasty faces, the kind that never see the sun, and knew that the men who barred his way were the nightprowlers and preying beasts of the city jungle.By them he was thrust back upon the pursuing, bull-rushing Patsy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又跟帕齐扭打在一起了；在尚不至于挨揍的短暂间隙，沃森再次恳求那帮人。再一次，没有人搭理他。这时他感到有点害怕。他听说过许多类似的情形，许多单枪匹马的人在这种龌龊地方被围殴，弄得伤筋断骨、面目全非，甚至死于这些人的拳脚之下。他还知道，如果他想逃出去，他既不能打袭击他的人，也不能对这些挡出他的人动手。</td>
		<td class="en">Again it was a clinch, in which, in momentary safety, Watson appealed to the gang.And again his words fell on deaf ears.Then it was that he knew of many similar knew fear.For he had known of many similar situations, in low dens like this, when solitary men were man-handled, their ribs and features caved in, themselves beaten and kicked to death.And he knew, further, that if he were to escape he must neither strike his assailant nor any of the men who opposed him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过他胸中充满着正义的愤慨。在任何情况下，以七对一都是不公平的。他也发怒了，心中激荡起人人都会有的打斗的野性。但他想起了妻儿，想起了他未完成的书稿，想起了他心爱的位于高地上的那一万英亩平整的大农场。他的眼前闪现出蔚蓝的天空，金色的阳光洒在他那片花团锦簇的草地上，懒洋洋的牛群站在齐膝深的小河中，鳟鱼在涟漪间穿梭。生活很美好——简直太美好了，他不能只为一时的野性冲动，拿这么美好的生活来冒险。总之，沃森非常冷静，也很害怕。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet in him was righteous indignation.Under no circumstances could seven to one be fair.Also, he was angry, and there stirred in him the fighting beast that is in all men.But he remembered his wife and children, his unfinished book, the ten thousand rolling acres of the up-country ranch he loved so well.He even saw in flashing visions the blue of the sky, the golden sun pouring down on his flower-spangled meadows, the lazy cattle knee-deep in the brooks, and the flash of trout in the riffles.Life was good-too good for him to risk it for a moment’s sway of the beast.In short, Carter Watson was cool and scared.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的对手被他巧妙地抱住，正竭力想要扳倒他。沃森再次把他摔倒在地，想夺路而逃，又再次被那些脸色苍白的人推回来。他躲过帕齐右手的重拳，再次跟他扭打在一起。这样反反复复了好多遍。沃森愈发冷静，而帕茨总是打不到他，白费气力，更加火冒三丈。扭在一起的时候，他就用头去撞。第一次，他拿额角撞到了沃森的鼻子。此后，每次扭到一起的时候，沃森就把脸贴到帕茨的胸口上。但是怒火中烧的帕齐还是接着撞，拿眼睛、鼻子和脸撞沃森的头顶。帕齐受的伤越重，他撞得越急、越狠。</td>
		<td class="en">His opponent, locked by his masterly clinch, was striving to throw him.Again Watson put him on the floor, broke away, and was thrust back by the pasty-faced circle to duck Patsy’s swinging right and effect another clinch.This happened many times.And Watson grew even cooler, while the baffled Patsy, unable to inflict punishment, raged wildly and more wildly.He took to batting with his head in the clinches.The first time, he landed his forehead flush on Watson’s nose.After that, the latter, in the clinches, buried his face in Patsy’s breast.But the enraged Patsy batted on, striking his own eye and nose and cheek on the top of the other’s head.The more he was thus injured, the more and the harder did Patsy bat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这场一厢情愿的打斗持续了十二到十五分钟。沃森一直没有动拳头，只想努力脱身。有时候两人散开来，沃森就在桌子之间躲闪，试图冲到门口，那些脸色苍白的人就抓住他的大衣下摆，将他扔回去，挨帕齐挥舞过来的拳头。沃森没完没了地一次又一次和帕齐扭在一起，然后将他摔个仰面朝天；每一次，他都将帕茨转一个向，朝着门口的方向扔出去，靠着他一次次倒地来一点一点打通道路。</td>
		<td class="en">This one-sided contest continued for twelve or fifteen minutes.Watson never struck a blow, and strove only to escape.Sometimes, in the free moments, circling about among the tables as he tried to win the door, the pasty-faced men gripped his coat-tails and flung him back at the swinging right of the on-rushing Patsy.Time upon time, and times without end, he clinched and put Patsy on his back, each time first whirling him around and putting him down in the direction of the door and gaining toward that goal by the length of the fall.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终，丢了帽子、披头散发、鼻血长流、一只眼睛已经睁不开的沃森终于逃到了人行道上，撞进一个警察的怀里。</td>
		<td class="en">In the end, hatless, disheveled, with streaming nose and one eye closed, Watson won to the sidewalk and into the arms of a policeman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“逮捕那个人。”沃森气喘吁吁地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Arrest that man,” Watson panted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，帕齐，”警察问道，“出了什么乱子？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hello, Patsy,” said the policeman.“What’s the mix-up?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Your Honor,” Watson said next day to the village Justice, a well to do farmer and graduate, thirty years before, from a cow college, “since this Sol Witberg has seen fit to charge me with battery, following upon my charge of battery against him, I would suggest that both cases be lumped together.The testimony and the facts are the same in both cases.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I was picking flowers,” he testified.“Picking flowers on my own land, never dreaming of danger.Suddenly this man rushed upon me from behind the trees.‘I am the Dodo,’ he says, ‘and I can do you to a frazzle.Put up your hands.’ I smiled, but with that, biff, biff, he struck me, knocking me down and spilling my flowers.The language he used was frightful.It was an unprovoked and brutal assault.Look at my cheek.Look at my nose—I could not understand it.He must have been drunk.Before I recovered from my surprise he had administered this beating.I was in danger of my life and was compelled to defend himself.That is all, Your Honor, though I must say, in conclusion, that I cannot get over my perplexity.Why did he say he was the Dodo?Why did he so wantonly attack me?”</td></tr>
