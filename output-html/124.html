		<td class="en">“Please do not use my name in any way.Please do not even divulge that fact that I own a machine.I have entirely stopped using the typewriter, for the reason that I never could write a letter with it to anybody without receiving a request by return mail that I would not only describe the machine, but state what progress I had made in the use of it, etc., etc.I don’t like to write letters, and so I don’t want people to know I own this curiosity-breeding little joker.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有人给克莱门斯先生写了一张便条，问他这封信是不是真的，马克·吐温是不是真在那么早以前就有了一台打字机。克莱门斯先生回复说，最好的答案就在下面一章里，选自他自己没有发表的自传：</td>
		<td class="en">A note was sent to Mr. Clemens asking him if the letter was genuine and whether he really had a typewriter as long ago as that.Mr. Clemens replied that his best answer is the following chapter from his unpublished autobiography:</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >向打字员口授自传对我来说是一种新的经历，但进展很顺利，还可以节省时间和“语言”——那种减轻烦恼的语言。</td>
		<td class="en">Dictating autobiography to a typewriter is a new experience for me, but it goes very well, and is going to save time and “language”—the kind of language that soothes vexation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我以前也向打字员口授过——但不是自传。那次经历和现在这次经历已相隔好长时间了——三十多年了！好像一辈子那么长。这么长时间里发生了很多事——包括打字机，还有我们其他人。在那段时间里，一开始，打字机很让人好奇。拥有打字机的人也很让人好奇。但现在却相反：没有打字机的人，才让人好奇呢。我第一次看到打字机是在——哪年？我想是1873年——因为那时我和纳斯比在一起，正在波士顿。我们肯定是在演讲，否则我们就不会到波士顿，我想是这样。就在那段时间，我离开了演讲台。</td>
		<td class="en">I have dictated to a typewriter before—but not autobiography.Between that experience and the present one there lies a mighty gap—more than thirty years!It is sort of lifetime.In that wide interval much has happened—to the type-machine as well as to the rest of us.At the beginning of that interval a type-machine was a curiosity.The person who owned one was a curiosity, too.But now it is the other way about: the person who DOESN’T own one is a curiosity.I saw a type-machine for the first time in—what year?I suppose it was 1873—because Nasby was with me at the time, and it was in Boston.We must have been lecturing, or we could not have been in Boston, I take it.I quitted the platform that season.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过别把那件事放心上了，没关系的。我和纳斯比透过橱窗看到了打字机，就走进去看了看。销售员给我们讲解，展示了打印出的样本，还说一分钟可以打57个单词——我们很坦率地说不相信他的话。于是他让打字的女孩开始打字，我们用表给她计时。她的确在60秒钟内打了57个字。我们已经有点相信了，不过我们说或许她再打就打不出来了。但确实又打出来了。我们一遍一遍地给那个打字员计时——总是同样的结果：她获胜了。她把字打在一张细长的纸条上，她一打好我们就赶紧装入口袋，以便当稀罕物给别人看。打字机的价格是125美元。我买了一台，然后我们二人非常激动地离开了。</td>
		<td class="en">But never mind about that, it is no matter.Nasby and I saw the machine through a window, and went in to look at it.The salesman explained it to us, showed us samples of its work, and said it could do fifty-seven words a minute—a statement which we frankly confessed that we did not believe.So he put his type-girl to work, and we timed her by the watch.She actually did the fifty-seven in sixty seconds.We were partly convinced, but said it probably couldn’t happen again.But it did.We timed the girl over and over again—with the same result always: she won out.She did her work on narrow slips of paper, and we pocketed them as fast as she turned them out, to show as curiosities.The price of the machine was one hundred and twenty-five dollars.I bought one, and we went away very much excited.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们回到宾馆，拿出那些纸条，有点失望地发现，上面的单词都是一样的。打字的女孩把一个准则记在心里，因此节约了时间和劳动。但是我们争论说——而且很有把握——第一个打字员完全可以和第一个打台球的人相提并论：他们在这行里表现出来的，顶多是实际的三分之一或二分之一。如果这台机器留存了下来——如果它能够留存——就不断地会有专家涌现出来，毫无疑问，他们的打字速度会是女打字员的两倍。他们一分钟可以打100个单词——就像我在台上的演讲速度。这个成绩很久以前已经被打破了。</td>
		<td class="en">At the hotel we got out our slips and were a little disappointed to find that they contained the same words.The girl had economized time and labor by using a formula which she knew by heart.However, we argued—safely enough—that the FIRST type-girl must naturally take rank with the first billiard-player: neither of them could be expected to get out of the game any more than a third or a half of what was in it.If the machine survived—IF it survived—experts would come to the front, by and by, who would double the girl’s output without a doubt.They would do one hundred words a minute—my talking speed on the platform.That score has long ago been beaten.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在家的时候，我摆弄着这个玩具，反反复复地重复打着“那个男孩站在燃烧的甲板上”，到最后，我可以以每分钟12个单词的速度把那个男孩的冒险经历打出来；然后我又继续拿起笔，这是我的职业，只有好奇的客人来访时，为了让他们大吃一惊，我才会用那台机器。他们拿走了很多令有那个男孩和燃烧的甲板故事的纸张。</td>
		<td class="en">At home I played with the toy, repeated and repeating and repeated “The Boy stood on the Burning Deck,” until I could turn that boy’s adventure out at the rate of twelve words a minute; then I resumed the pen, for business, and only worked the machine to astonish inquiring visitors.They carried off many reams of the boy and his burning deck.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久我雇佣了一个年轻的女子，开始进行第一次口授工作（只是些信件），一直到现在，那个第一次也是最后一次。打字机没法同时打大写字母和小写字母（像现在一样），只能打出大写字母。它们是哥特体的大写字母，非常难看。我还记得我口授的第一封信。是寄给爱德华·博克的，他当时还是一个孩子。那时我和他还不熟。他现在这种积极进取的精神并不是突然出现的——他从小就有。他在收集亲笔签名，他不满足于仅仅签个名字，他想要的，是一封完整的带亲笔签名的信件。我给了他一封能满足他要求的信——用打字机打印的大写字母写的，有亲笔签名，一切齐全。那封信很长，是一封说教的信；信里面有忠告，还有责备。我在信里说写作是我的生意，是我的饭碗；我说让一个人把自己的生意样本送给别人是不公平的；他会找铁匠要马蹄铁吗？他会找医生要一具尸体吗？</td>
		<td class="en">By and by I hired a young woman, and did my first dictating (letters, merely), and my last until now.The machine did not do both capitals and lower case (as now), but only capitals.Gothic capitals they were, and sufficiently ugly.I remember the first letter I dictated.It was to Edward Bok, who was a boy then.I was not acquainted with him at that time.His present enterprising spirit is not new—he had it in that early day.He was accumulating autographs, and was not content with mere signatures, he wanted a whole autograph LETTER.I furnished it—in type-written capitals, SIGNATURE AND ALL.It was long; it was a sermon; it contained advice; also reproaches.I said writing was my TRADE, my bread-and-butter; I said it was not fair to ask a man to give away samples of his trade; would he ask the blacksmith for a horseshoe? would he ask the doctor for a corpse?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >下面我要讲一件重要的事了——我觉得重要的事。1874年的时候，那个年轻女子用打字机把我的一本书《论打字机》的一大部分打了出来。在自传的前一章里，我宣布自己是第一个出于实用目的在家里安装电话的人；现在我断定——直到我把它送人——我是世界上第一个用打字机写作的人。那本书一定是《汤姆索耶历险记》。我在1872年写了前半部分，1874年完成了剩下的内容。我的机械师1874年替我打了一本书，所以我想应该是那本。</td>
		<td class="en">Now I come to an important matter—as I regard it.In the year ’74 the young woman copied a considerable part of a book of mine On the Machine.In a previous chapter of this Autobiography I have claimed that I was the first person in the world that ever had a telephone in the house for practical purposes; I will now claim—until dispossess—that I was the first person in the world to APPLY THE TYPE-MACHINE TO LITERATURE.That book must have been The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.I wrote the first half of it in ’72, the rest of it in ’74.My machinist type-copied a book for me in ’74, so I concluded it was that one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那台早期的打字机反复无常，有很多缺点——可怕的缺点。它的缺点就和现代打字机的优点一样多。过了一两年，我发现打字机降低了我的身份，所以我觉得我应该把打字机给豪厄尔斯。他很不愿意要，因为他对新鲜事物持怀疑态度，对新鲜事物很不友好，一直到今天还是这样。但是我说服了他。他非常信任我，虽说我自己都不信任这台机器，但是我还是说服了他。他把打字机带回波士顿的家，我的士气恢复了，但是他却再也没有恢复过。</td>
		<td class="en">That early machine was full of caprices, full of defects—devilish ones.It had as many immoralities as the machine of today has virtues.After a year or two I found that it was degrading my character, so I thought I would give it to Howells.He was reluctant, for he was suspicious of novelties and unfriendly toward them, and he remains so to this day.But I persuaded him.He had great confidence in me, and I got him to believe things about the machine that I did not believe myself.He took it home to Boston, and my morals began to improve, but his have never recovered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他保管了六个月，然后还给了我。后来我又把它送出去了两次，但是都呆不长，打字机又回到了我的手里。后来我把打字机给了我的马车夫，帕特里克·麦卡利尔，他非常感激。因为他不了解这个东西，还以为我想让他变得聪明点、优秀点。他一变得聪明和优秀，就拿打字机跟一个异教徒换了个横座马鞍，可是他不能用，我所了解的这台打字机的历史到此结束。</td>
		<td class="en">He kept it six months, and then returned it to me.I gave it away twice after that, but it wouldn’t stay; it came back.Then I gave it to our coachman, Patrick McAleer, who was very grateful, because he did not know the animal, and thought I was trying to make him wiser and better.As soon as he got wiser and better he traded it to a heretic for a side-saddle which he could not use, and there my knowledge of its history ends.</td></tr>
