		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >先生——我即将奔七十，眼看就要到了，只有三年之遥了。不可避免地，我肯定很快就要走了。我现在应当开始妥善安置我在人世间的房子了，这无疑是明智之举，这样我才能把房子顺利而彻底地安置好，而不是拖到最后一天，就像我们常常看到的那样，本想同时将阴阳两处的家安置妥当，但却被这些事情而破坏——仓促不可避免；公证员和牧师不能融洽合作，不能按次序行事，不能给对方友好的帮助，造成了时间的浪费和局面的混乱——或许不能像棒球运动员防守那样，那样的状态很难达到，但至少也要像裁判和次要的队员那样使比赛继续进行；由于利益冲突和缺乏协调行动，双方常常会打得难解难分。如果一次只安置好一处房子，这种不幸就可能不会发生，及时开始并给每处房子相当和正好的时间，慌乱就可以避免。</td>
		<td class="en">Sir,—I am approaching seventy; it is in sight; it is only three years away.Necessarily, I must go soon.It is but matter-of-course wisdom, then, that I should begin to set my worldly house in order now, so that it may be done calmly and with thoroughness, in place of waiting until the last day, when, as we have often seen, the attempt to set both houses in order at the same time has been marred by the necessity for haste and by the confusion and waste of time arising from the inability of the notary and the ecclesiastic to work together harmoniously, taking turn about and giving each other friendly assistance—not perhaps in fielding, which could hardly be expected, but at least in the minor offices of keeping game and umpiring; by consequence of which conflict of interests and absence of harmonious action a draw has frequently resulted where this ill-fortune could not have happened if the houses had been set in order one at a time and hurry avoided by beginning in season, and giving to each the amount of time fairly and justly proper to it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了妥当安置我在人世间的房子，我发现很重要的是，我必须亲自处理一两件事。虽然长期以来，处在我这个位置的人习惯将事情整个交给别人处理，但结果常常很令人遗憾。这次我只希望谈谈其中的一件事：讣告。出于必要的考虑，讣告这东西经谁手都不可能像经过本人那样慎重客观地办好。在这项工作中并不是事实处于首要地位，而是撰写讣告的人阐明事实的方式，他给事实赋予的意义，他从事实中得到的结论，他通过事实作出的判断。判定，你知道：那是一条危险线。</td>
		<td class="en">In setting my earthly house in order I find it of moment that I should attend in person to one or two matters which men in my position have long had the habit of leaving wholly to others, with consequences often most regrettable.I wish to speak of only one of these matters at this time: Obituaries.Of necessity, an Obituary is a thing which cannot be so judiciously edited by any hand as by that of the subject of it.In such a work it is not the Facts that are of chief importance, but the light which the obituarist shall throw upon them, the meaning which he shall dress them in, the conclusions which he shall draw from them, and the judgments which he shall deliver upon them.The Verdicts, you understand: that is the danger-line.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >考虑到这个问题，并且鉴于我即将到来的变化，我认为采取以下切实可行的措施是明智的：承蒙出版社的好意，让我接触那些长期不变的讣告，给我特权——如果这要求不算太过分的话——进行编辑，不修改其中的事实，只修改其中的判定。这不是为了眼前的利益，也不仅是出于家族利益的考虑，而是另一个世界里可用的积极影响，那个世界里可能有些人对我并不太友好。</td>
		<td class="en">In considering this matter, in view of my approaching change, it has seemed to me wise to take such measures as may be feasible, to acquire, by courtesy of the press, access to my standing obituaries, with the privilege—if this is not asking too much—of editing, not their Facts, but their Verdicts.This, not for the present profit, further than as concerns my family, but as a favorable influence usable on the Other Side, where there are some who are not friendly to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以上我解释了我的动机，我现在请求您能为我向大众出版界发出呼吁。我希望像这样的杂志和期刊能将我的讣告放在文件架上，以备某一天急用，不用再等，只需将讣告立即发表，并送我一份附有批语的副本。我的居住地就是纽约市——我没有其他固定住所或暂住地。</td>
		<td class="en">With this explanation of my motives, I will now ask you of your courtesy to make an appeal for me to the public press.It is my desire that such journals and periodicals as have obituaries of me lying in their pigeonholes, with a view to sudden use some day, will not wait longer, but will publish them now, and kindly send me a marked copy.My address is simply New York City—I have no other that is permanent and not transient.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我将会改正它们——不是事实，而是判定——删去对我在另一世界会造成不良影响的话，然后写上更审慎的字眼。当然，我应当为那些省略或替换的地方支付双倍费用，但我更要为所有讣告原稿中证明是恰当且睿智的用词支付四倍报酬，因为那就省掉我修改的麻烦了。</td>
		<td class="en">I will correct them—not the Facts, but the Verdicts—striking out such clauses as could have a deleterious influence on the Other Side, and replacing them with clauses of a more judicious character.I should, of course, expect to pay double rates for both the omissions and the substitutions; and I should also expect to pay quadruple rates for all obituaries which proved to be rightly and wisely worded in the originals, thus requiring no emendations at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我渴望我离开这世界后，这些修订过的讣告可以整齐地装订成册给我的家人带来永久不变的慰藉和消遣，并且它作为一件传家宝，应该给我遥远的后代子孙带来缅怀先人的作用而不仅仅是有限的商业价值。</td>
		<td class="en">It is my desire to leave these Amended Obituaries neatly bound behind me as a perennial consolation and entertainment to my family, and as an heirloom which shall have a mournful but definite commercial value for my remote posterity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我请求，先生，您插入这条广告（斜体，5.5点铅字，刊登封里），并把账单寄给极其敬重您的</td>
		<td class="en">I beg, sir, that you will insert this Advertisement (1t-eow, agate, inside), and send the bill to Yours very respectfully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马克·吐温</td>
		<td class="en">Mark Twain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >附言——对于最佳讣告——既适合我当众宣读，又旨在激发人们的缅怀之情——我渴望颁发一份奖品，是一幅本人的自画像，完全是由本人亲自用钢笔和墨水没有经过事前指导创作的。这墨水保证是最顶级的艺术家使用的那种。</td>
		<td class="en">P.S.—For the best Obituary—one suitable for me to read in public, and calculated to inspire regret—I desire to offer a Prize, consisting of a Portrait of me done entirely by myself in pen and ink without previous instructions.The ink warranted to be the kind used by the very best artists.</td></tr>
