		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我于一六三二年出生在约克市。我出身名门，但不是本地人。我父亲来自德国不来梅，来英国后起初定居在赫尔。他做生意发了一笔财，然后金盆洗手，在约克定居下来。在那里他和母亲结了婚。母亲的家族叫鲁滨孙，是当地的名门。我因此被称作鲁滨孙·克鲁伊茨内。但是由于英国人的德语发音常常不标准，我们被叫做克鲁索——而且干脆连我们自己也这么叫，这么写了，我的朋友也都这样称呼我。</td>
		<td class="en">I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull.He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我有两个哥哥。一个是驻佛兰德的英国步兵团的中校，这支部队曾经由著名的洛克哈特上校领导。我的这个哥哥在敦刻尔克附近的一场与西班牙人的战事中身亡。我对二哥的境况一无所知，正同我父母不知道我之后的境况一样。</td>
		<td class="en">I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我是家中的第三个儿子，没有学习过什么手艺，我自小就喜欢胡思乱想。我年事已高的父亲让我接受了较好的教育，我曾经在寄宿学校和免费的乡村学校就读，他还想让我将来学习法律。但是我一心想要出海，其他任何事情都不能让我满足。对航海的爱好，使我十分抗拒父亲的意愿，我不顾他的命令，也不管母亲和朋友的劝告和恳求。我的天性中似乎蕴藏着一些致命的因素，注定了我将来悲苦的命运。</td>
		<td class="en">Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house education and a country free school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的父亲是个明智而沉稳的人，他预见到了我这种嗜好的后果，针对这后果严肃地给了我一些极有益的忠告。一天早上，他把我叫到他的房间里，那时候他因为痛风只能呆在那里。他很恳切地就这个问题规劝我。他问我，除了漫游的癖好之外，我还有什么理由离开自己的父母和祖国。我在家乡可以得到好的引荐，有望通过勤奋努力创造财富，生活得安稳快乐。他告诉我，一般出海冒险的人，不是穷困潦倒就是梦想一夜暴富，他们进取心强，想要通过不平凡的事业扬名。这些事情对我来说，要么不值得，要么不必要。我处在中间状态，属于平民中的上流人物。他凭他长期的经验发现，这是世界上最好的状态，它最容易让人幸福。处于这个状态的人，不像进行体力劳动的劳苦大众，要忍受艰难困苦，也不像上流社会的人那般骄奢淫逸，充满野心而彼此嫉妒。他告诉我，这种状态是所有人都羡慕的，通过一件事我就可以认识到中间状态的幸福。那就是，国王常常悲叹出身高贵带来的悲惨后果，希望自己处在贫贱与高贵的两级中间。智者也证明，中间状态的人能得到真正的幸福。他祈祷道：“使我既不贫穷也不富裕。”</td>
		<td class="en">My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject.He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father’s house and my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state; or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他让我留心观察，说那样我就总会发现上层和下层社会的生活都充满了灾难，只有中间阶层灾祸最少。中层阶级的人们不会像上层或下层的人那样经历如此多的波澜起伏。而且，一方面，他们不会像富人那样因挥霍无度、骄奢淫逸而急躁不安、身心俱疲；另一方面，他们也不会像劳动人民那样因缺衣少食，操劳不堪，以及这种穷苦生活自然而然带来的种种后果而忧心忡忡。中间状态的生活包含了世间的一切优点和幸福安乐。中层阶级的人们生活安稳富足，他们中庸节制，性情安宁，身体健康，参与社交娱乐活动，享受世人渴望的种种乐趣，这些都是中层阶级的福分。中层的人们能够平静安稳、舒适自得地度过人生，他们不用劳心劳力，不用每天为生计操劳，为困境所逼，以至于伤神劳身；也不会因妒火中烧，好大喜功而野心勃勃，不得安宁。相反地，他们生活富裕，可以安稳地度过一生，体验人生的甘甜滋味，避开艰难困苦。他们感受到幸福，并在自己的日常经历中更加切身地体会到这种幸福。</td>
		<td class="en">He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasiness, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments;that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things;but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day’s experience to know it more sensibly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，他非常慈爱而恳切地劝我不要耍小孩子脾气，不要急着自讨苦吃。自然常理和我的出身是都不会让我过苦日子的。我不用去为生计奔波忙碌，他会为我好好安排，努力让我过上他所说的中产阶级生活。如果我在这世上不能过上安逸幸福的生活，那肯定都是命运或者我自身的过错所致。他知道我要做的事情肯定会伤害自己，才这样尽责地警告我。如果我还是过上了苦日子，他也无计可施了。总之，他说如果我像他要求的那样，安心呆在家里的话，他会为我好好安排。他从没鼓励我离家出航，如果我将来遭遇不测，和他真是没什么太大关系。最后，他告诉我，我的大哥就是一个很好的例子。他曾同样恳切地劝导大哥不要去佛兰德打仗，但没能劝住血气方刚的大哥加入部队，结果大哥命丧黄泉。尽管他说他会不停地为我祈祷，他又说如果我迈出这愚蠢的一步，那么他敢说，上帝是不会保佑我的。将来在我孤身无援的时候，会为自己忽视他而悔恨良久。</td>
		<td class="en">After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided against;that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavor to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it;and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away;and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed;and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我注意到，他的最后一部分讲话预言成真，尽管我认为我父亲自己当时并没有料到将来会真的变成这样。我观察到，他一直老泪纵横，尤其是在他说到大哥阵亡的时候；说到以后我会在孤身无援之时悔不当初，他因过于悲伤而不能言语，不得不中断了谈话。</td>
		<td class="en">I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself—I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我被谈话深深地感动了。而且说真的，谁又能无动于衷？我下定决心，不再考虑出航之事，而是顺从父意，留在家中。但是天哪！几天之后我就决心全无。简单来说，为了防止父亲继续对我纠缠不休，在接下来的几周里我下定了决心，要从他身边逃得远远的。然而，我并不是刚下定决心就头脑发热地仓促行事。我在母亲心情比平常好些的时候去找了她，告诉她我决心已定，一定要出去见世面，除了这个以外我没有足够的决心去做任何事。父亲最好答应我，而不是逼得我不经他同意就离家出走。我都十八岁了，去当学徒或者律师助手都为时已晚。我肯定我永远不会期满出师了。在我出师之前，我就会从师傅那里逃走出海。如果她能够和我父亲谈谈，让他同意我出海一次，如果我回来以后觉得自己不喜欢，以后就再也不去了。而且我保证会加倍努力以补偿被我浪费的时间。</td>
		<td class="en">I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be otherwise?And I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my father’s desire.But alas!A few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father’s further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it,and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time that I had lost.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这让我母亲勃然大怒。她告诉我，她知道对我父亲说这件事是徒劳的。他十分清楚什么对我来说才是好的，因而不会答应我去做如此伤害自己的事情。她还说，实在不能理解为什么我在和父亲谈话之后还想着这件事情，况且这次谈话中父亲还是如此温和而慈爱地开导我。简言之，如果我一定要自我毁灭的话，没人会帮助我。她告诉我，他们永远不会同意我出海的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然母亲拒绝向父亲转达我的意思，但我后来听说她把整个谈话过程都告诉了父亲。父亲听了很担心，叹息着对母亲说：“如果这孩子呆在家里的话，还有可能会幸福。但是假如他出海的话，就会成为全世界最悲惨的人，我绝对不能同意。”</td>
		<td class="en">Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, “That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >将近一年之后，我才逃出了家门。在这一年当中，父母亲劝我做正经事，我却一直固执地置若罔闻，还经常和父母争执，怪他们如此断然地反对我的真实意愿。一天，我出于偶然到了赫尔市，那时我还没有偷偷出海的想法。但是我在那里遇到一个朋友，他将乘坐他父亲的船去往伦敦。他用水手惯用的鼓动别人出海的办法，怂恿我和他们一道出海。他说我连船费都不必付。我没有找父母商量，也没有托人传话。我认为他们迟早会听到我离开的消息。我没有祈祷，也没有让父亲为我祝福，对具体情况和后果也没多想。谁知道我会在一个不吉利的时辰——一九六五年九月一日——登上了一艘开往伦敦的船。我相信，没有一个年轻的冒险家能像我这般厄运如此之早地开始，还持续了如此之长的时间。船刚开出亨伯河口天就刮起风来，海水暴涨，令人恐惧。因为我以前从没出过海，身体感到非常不适，心里又极度害怕。我现在开始严肃地反思我所做的一切了，我背弃了家庭和责任，真是罪过，现在老天惩罚我了，正义也算得到了伸张。父母的忠告，父亲的泪水和母亲的恳求都生动地浮现在我脑中，我的良心尚存，不像后来那样铁石心肠，于是不由自责起来。我不该不听劝告，违背对上帝和父亲的责任。</td>
		<td class="en">It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to.But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time; but, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail to London in his father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it;but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking God’s blessing or my father’s, without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London.Never any young adventurer’s misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine.The ship was no sooner out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind.I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father’s house, and abandoning my duty.All the good counsels of my parents, my father’s tears and my mother’s entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个时候，风暴的势头更猛了，海面骤然升起。虽然这和我以后多次所见的情形是不能比的，也比不上几天后我见到的类似情况。但是它也足以吓到我这个对航海毫无经验的年轻水手了。我觉得每一个波浪都可能将我们吞没。每次船跌进海上的水涡的时候我都觉得船沉到了海里，而我们再也浮不上来了。在这种惶恐的状态下我无数次地发誓，无数次地表明决心：如果这次出航，上帝能给我一条生路，只要我的双脚能再次安全踏上地面，我会马上回到家中的父亲身旁，有生之年再也不上船半步。我会听他的建议，再也不自找苦吃。现在，我清楚地意识到父亲对中间状态的生活看法确实是对的。他的一生是如此舒适安逸，从未经历过海上的风浪和陆上的困苦。我决心像个真正的回头浪子那样，回到家中父亲的身边。</td>
		<td class="en">All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter.I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions that if it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more.Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >风暴持续期间以及以后的一段时间之内，我都有着这种清醒明智的想法。但是第二天风势变弱了，海面平静些了，我对这一切也有些习惯了。但是我还是成天愁容不展，还有些晕船。快到晚上的时候天气变晴了，风差不多停了，一个美丽晴朗的夜晚来临了。当天晚上的日落和第二天早晨的日出都很明朗宁静。太阳照耀下的海面上风平浪静，我觉得这是我见过的最怡人的景象。</td>
		<td class="en">These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little seasick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我晚上睡得很好，现在已经不太晕船了，心情也不错。我惊奇地看着前一天还翻腾咆哮的大海，它竟然在这么短的时间之内就变得如此平静怡人。那时我那诱导我出海的朋友怕我真的决心不再出海，就来看我：“嘿，鲍勃，”他说，同时在我肩膀上拍了几下，“风浪过后你感觉如何？我敢说那天晚上吹起的一股微风吓到你了吧？”“你管那叫一股微风？”我说，“那可是场可怕的风暴啊。”“一场风暴？你这个傻瓜，”他回答道，“你把那叫风暴？嗨，那算什么啊！只要我们有艘好船，海面也够宽，我们对这么一点点风根本不在乎。不过你只是个新手，所以也不奇怪，鲍勃。来，我们去喝碗潘趣酒，把这些都忘了吧。没看见现在的天气多好吗？”关于我的伤心往事我就长话短说，我们像所有的水手一样，弄了些潘趣酒，我喝了个大醉。那天晚上我行为放纵，把自己的后悔之情、对自己过去行为的反思和对未来的决心统统抛到了脑后。总之，当风暴过去之后，海面又变得光滑而平静，我那些纷乱的想法也消失了。我忘记了对被大海吞没的恐惧，以前的热望又回到心头。我完全忘了自己在困境中所立下的誓言和所下的决心。我发现，在有些时候一些忏悔和反思确实会像以往那样不时回到我的脑中，但是我拼命摆脱它们，像是要从坏脾气中解脱一般，我通过和别人一起喝酒胡闹让自己从中振作起来。不久之后，我就控制住了这些冲动，不让它们回到我的脑中。不出五六天的时间，我就像所有决心不顾良心、追随欲望的年轻人所希望的那样，完全战胜了良知。但是，我因此注定会遇到另一个灾难。正如一贯的情形，老天决心毫不手软地惩罚我，而我也没有任何借口。我没有把上次的经历当作上帝的救赎，下次的灾祸就要厉害得多，就连我们当中最凶险无情的水手都要害怕、求饶。</td>
		<td class="en">I had slept well in the night, and was now no more seasick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after.And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me; “Well, Bob,” says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, “how do you do after it?I warrant you were frighted, weren’t you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?”“A capful d’ye calls it?” said I; “’twas a terrible storm.”“A storm, you fool you,” replies he; “do you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you’re but a freshwater sailor, Bob.Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we’ll forget all that; d’ye see what charming weather ’tis now?”To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made and I was made half drunk with it: and in that one night’s wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the future.In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress.I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavor to return again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of those fits—for so I called them; and I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire.But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们在出海的第六天到达了雅茅斯锚地。风暴之后天气晴好，但一直刮着逆风，所以我们的船行驶的路程不算远。我们不得不在这里找了一处地方抛锚，停了下来。逆风继续从西南方向吹来，一直吹了七八天。很多从纽卡斯尔来的船也驶进了这个锚地。因为这是一个方便船只停靠以等待顺风，然后驶入河道的公共港口。</td>
		<td class="en">The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way since the storm.Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary—viz. at southwest—for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而我们不该在这里停这么久的。我们本应该随着潮水驶进河口。但是风太紧，在我们停了四五天后刮得更猛了。但是这个锚地是个公认的上好港口。我们的锚质量很好，各种锚泊索具也很结实，因此我们的水手都不以为意，毫无对危险的忧惧，继续按海上的生活方式休息玩乐。但在第八天早晨，风刮得猛了。我们所有人都忙着降下中桅，并且把所有东西都紧挨着收拾起来，以便让船安稳地停泊。中午的时候浪势很高，有好几次，我们的船头没入了水中，漫进了不少海水。有一两次我们以为我们的船脱锚了，船长便下令把备用大锚放下，于是我们在船头放了两个锚才泊好船，将锚索放到了最长。</td>

		<td class="en">A little after noon I found the sea very calm and the tide ebbed so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship.And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if we had kept on board we had been all safe—that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirety destitute of all comfort and company as I now was.This forced tears to my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes—for the weather was hot to extremity—and took the water.But when I came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of.I swam round her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hung down by the fore chains so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope I got up into the forecastle of the ship.Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or, rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water.By this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see what was spoiled and what was free.And, first, I found that all the ship’s provisions were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose.I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had; indeed, need enough of to spirit me for what was before me.Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >坐着苦等，只想着得不到的东西只会一事无成，而这种绝境又激发了我自己动手的念头。这里有一些多余的帆桁，还有两三块大木板和一两根多余的中桅。我决心要让这些东西派上用场。我连拖带拽，把凡是能搬得动的都用绳子绑在一起，扔下海去。之所以用绳子绑住它们，是防止它们被海水冲走。之后我从船的一侧下去，把它们拉到我的身边，把四根木头从首尾两端捆好，扎成木筏的样子。我又把两三根短木板横放在上面，在上面走了走，发现还不错。但是由于木头太轻，木筏承受不了太大的重量。于是我再次投入到工作中，用木匠的锯子把一根多余的中桅截成了三段，固定在木筏上，这真是费了我不少力气。但是我一直怀有希望，要把生活必需品都搬运走，这大大鼓励了我，让我完成了在其他情况下自己不可能完成的任务。</td>
		<td class="en">It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this extremity roused my application.We had several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope that they might not drive away.When this was done I went down the ship’s side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together at both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light.So I went to work, and with a carpenter’s saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains.But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another occasion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，我的木筏已经非常坚固了，能够承受相当大的重量。接下来我开始思考应该带些什么东西，怎样才能让它们不被海浪打湿。很快我就有了主意。我先把我能够找到的所有木板都铺到了木筏上，然后开始考虑我最需要的是什么东西。我把找到的三个船员的箱子倒空，然后放到了木筏上。我在第一个箱子里装满了食物：粮食、面包、大米、三块荷兰奶酪、五块风干的羊肉（这是我们的主要食品），以及一些残余的欧洲谷物。这些谷物是用来喂养我们航行时携带的一些家禽的，但是现在它们都已经死了。本来船上还有一些大麦和小麦，可让我失望的是，它们全都被老鼠吃掉或啃坏了。我也找到了几箱酒，都是船长的。里面有些甘露酒，还有五六加仑烧酒。我把酒整齐地堆起来，因为没有必要把酒装进箱子，也没有什么空间能放下它们了。我正在忙碌的时候，突然发现潮水涌动，虽然波动不大，但我还是眼看着脱在岸边沙滩上的大衣、衬衣和背心全都被冲走了，好不狼狈。我的身上只穿着一条及膝长的亚麻短裤，还有袜子。我游泳上船的时候只穿了这么多。然而，这使我不得不翻箱倒柜地找些衣服来穿。虽然找到了不少，可我只拿了目前需要的衣服。因为我更需要其他更为重要的东西，其中最重要的就是能够在岸上使用的工具。我找了很久才找到了木匠的箱子，这对我来说是最有价值的物品，在当时那种情境下，就算是一整条船的金子也不会比它有用。我都没来得及打开看一眼，就把它整个搬上了木筏，因为我大致了解里面都有些什么东西。</td>
		<td class="en">My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.My next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this.I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen’s chests, which I had broken open, and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the first of these I filled with provisions—viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat’s flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed.There had been some barley and wheat together; but, to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all.As for liquors, I found several, cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack.These I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for them.While I was doing this, I found the tide begins to flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on the shore, upon the sand, swim away.As for my breeches, which were only linen and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings.However, this set me on rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon—as, first, tools to work with on shore.And it was after long searching that I found out the carpenter’s chest, which was, indeed, a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a shipload of gold would have been at that time.I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来我就需要找一些火药和武器了。在大舱里有两支非常好的鸟枪和两把手枪。我把它们装好，又拿了几个盛火药的角桶，一小包子弹和两把生锈的旧刀子。我知道船上有三桶火药，可又不知道炮手把它们放在哪里了。我到处去找，好不容易才找到了。有两桶很好，非常干燥，而另一桶被水浸过了。于是我把这两桶火药和枪一起放到了木筏上。木筏上东西装得差不多了，我就开始思考怎么把它们运上岸去。我没有帆，没有桨，也没有舵，甚至一点点风就能把我的木筏掀翻在海里。</td>
		<td class="en">My next care was for some ammunition and arms.There were two very good fowling pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols.These I secured first, with some powder horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords.I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water.Those two I got to my raft with the arms.And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，目前有三点情况却给了我很大的鼓励：第一，海上风平浪静；第二，此时正在涨潮，潮水冲向海岸；第三，仅有的一点微风也是把我向岸上吹的。我找到了原来小艇上的两三支破损的船桨，除了箱子里的工具以外，我还找到了两把锯子，一把斧子和一把锤子。装载好这些货物，我就向岸边进发了。开始的一海里中，木筏行驶得很稳，只是方向稍稍有些偏离我最初上岸的地方。我发现附近的水都朝着岸边的一个方向流去，因此我猜想或许能够找到一条小溪或小河，这样我就可以顺着它找到一个港口卸货了。</td>
		<td class="en">I had three encouragements—1st, a smooth, calm sea; 2ndly, the tide rising, and setting in to the shore; 3rdly, what little wind there was blew me towards the land.And thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat—and, besides the tools which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer; with this cargo I put to sea.For a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the place where I had landed before; by which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，我现在很有可能遭遇第二次翻船。如果真是这样，那我可就伤透心了。由于不熟悉地形，木筏的一头搁浅在了岸边，另一头还漂在水里。只差一点点，货物就会滑向漂在水里的那一头，全部掉进水中。我竭尽全力地用背挡住箱子，不让它们滑落，但是无论我怎么用力，也无法推开木筏。而且，我无法从现在所处的位置上抽身出来，只能用尽全力顶着箱子。我就这样撑了足有半个小时，后来潮水渐长，木筏才稍稍升高，渐渐平衡。过了一小会儿，潮水继续上涨，木筏又可以漂动了。我用桨把它向河道撑去，然后向上划去，最终到达了河口。这里两旁是岸，一股强大的潮水向内翻涌。我观察了一下河两岸的地势，想要找一个合适的地方停靠。因为我并不想划到太远的地方去，而是想尽量停在离海岸近的地方，这样我就有可能发现海上航行的船只。</td>
		<td class="en">But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards the end that was afloat, and to fallen into the water.I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current of tide running up.I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river: hoping in time to see some ships at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as I could.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终我发现小河的右岸有一个小湾，我费尽力气，克服困难，把持着前进的方向，最终离岸边非常近了，我用桨撑住河底就能把木筏推进去。然而在这里，我又差一点把货物全都掉进水里。因为这里的河岸非常陡峭，甚至可以说是微微向下倾斜，以至没有地方可以停靠。如果木筏的一头靠在了岸边，就会被抬得很高，那么另一头就会沉下去。这样一来，货物又会掉进水里。我现在只能等着潮水涨到最高。我把船桨当作锚，把木筏的一头紧紧固定在岸上一片平地上，等待潮水漫过沙滩。果然，没过一会儿潮水就涨高了。一等到潮水涨得足够高，我就把木筏撑向那平坦的陆地，因为此时木筏吃水已经有一尺多深了。我把两只破桨插在地里，两头各一支，把木筏固定在那里。我就这样等着潮水退去，然后木筏和所有货物就可以安全地上岸了。之后我开始观察地形，试图找到一个合适的住所，并且找到合适的地方存放物品，以防发生意外。我还不知道我现在在哪里，在大陆上还是在岛屿上，不知道这里有人居住还是杳无人烟，会不会有凶猛的野兽出没。离我不到一英里处有一座小山，高大陡峭，似乎比周围的山要高，像是北面山脉的一段。我带了一支鸟枪、一把手枪和一角桶火药，全副武装，开始向那座山的山顶登去，看看能有什么发现。我历尽艰辛，克服重重困难，终于登上了山顶。然而，眼前的景象却让我痛苦万分。原来我身处一座四面环海的小岛之上，除了远处的几块礁石，看不到一点陆地的影子。还有两座更小的小岛，在西边大约三里格处。这座小岛十分荒凉，我确信这里除了野兽之外，不会有人居住。可是，到现在我连野兽也没有见到一只。但是我看到了很多禽鸟，可也不知道它们是什么鸟，更不知道打死之后肉到底能不能吃。回来的路上，我看见一棵茂林中的大树上停着一只大鸟，就朝它开了一枪。我相信，这是这个岛存在以来听到的第一枪。枪声一响，林子中各个角落一下子飞出了无数只各种各样的鸟，惊慌失措地尖声鸣叫，叫声各异，可我一种也不认识。我打死的那只鸟，从颜色和喙来看，应该是一种鹰，但却没有爪子。它的肉真是令人作呕，难以下咽。</td>
		<td class="en">At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty I guided my raft, and at last got so near that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in.But here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep—that is to say sloping—there was no place to land, but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again.All that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow over; and so it did.As soon as I found water enough—for my raft drew about a foot of water—I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side near one end, and one on the other side near the other end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever might happen.Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent or on an island; whether inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts or not.There was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it northward.I took out one of the fowling pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and difficulty got to the top, I saw any fate, to my great affliction—viz. that I was in an island environed every way with the sea: no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay a great way off; and two small islands, less than this, which lay about three leagues to the west.I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw none.Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds; neither was when I killed them could I tell what fit for food and what not.At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood.I believe it was the first gun that had been fired there since the creation of the world.I had no sooner fired, than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming and crying, and every one according to his usual note, but not one of them of any kind that I knew.As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more than common.Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day when the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons, which build, not as woodpigeons in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavored to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them; however, I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones, which were very good meat.And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make; as, indeed, with some of them it was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped.I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though I spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave that also over.In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to go to bed.I remembered the lump of beeswax with which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear, steady light, like a candle.In the middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my things, I found a little bag which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry—not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon.The little remainder of corn that had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that I had thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European—nay, as our English barley.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if it would rain.Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was covered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was.This held about three hours, and then began to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain very hard.All this while I sat upon the ground very much terrified and dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave again.With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent.But the rain was so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head.This violent rain forced me to a new work—viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have flooded my cave.After I had been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed.And now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum; which, however, I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.It continued raining all that night and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think of what I had best do; concluding that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open place which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed where I was, I should certainly one time or other be buried alive.With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent; and I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habitation.The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it; but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove.In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it.So with this resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished; but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and fit to remove.This was the 21st.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as ever that part of the thought was removed, all the impression that was raised from it wore off also, as I have noted already.Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the impression it had made went off also.I had no more sense of God or His judgments—much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being from His hand—than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life.But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.These reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my distemper; and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words from me like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires or with hopes: it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress.My thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries of my soul I knew not what my tongue might express.But it was rather exclamation, such as, “Lord, what a miserable creature am I!If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help; and what will become of me!”Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.In this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story—viz. that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery.“Now,” said I, aloud, “my dear father’s words are come to pass; God’s justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me.I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents.I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it.I abused their help and assistance, which would have lifted me in the world, and would have made everything easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.”Then I cried out, “Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress.”This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many years.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >毫无疑问，我是受上帝的指引走向那个箱子，为我自己找到了一个既能治疗身体，又能治疗心灵的方法。我打开箱子,找到了我想要的烟叶。我以前保留下来的几本书也放在那里，于是我拿出了以前提到的那本《圣经》，但至今我还没有闲暇或欲望去打开它。我的意思是，我把它拿出来，和烟一起拿到了桌子上。我不知道怎么用烟来治疗我的病，也不知道会不会有用，但我还是用它做了几个试验，好像我认定了它多多少少会起些作用。我首先摘下一片叶子放在嘴里咀嚼，起初，这使我的大脑几乎麻木，因为烟叶是绿色的,很有劲儿，而且我还不太习惯它。我又摘下一些叶子，把它们在朗姆酒里浸泡一两个小时，决定在躺下的时候喝上一些。最后，我在炭火上烧了一些烟叶，然后把我的鼻子尽可能地凑上前去闻烟叶的味道，只要我能忍受这种几乎让人窒息的热度。这期间，我拿起那本《圣经》开始读起来；但受到烟的影响，我的思路很乱，不能读下去，至少在那个时候不能；我只是随手打开书，首先进入我的视线的句子是：“有麻烦时呼唤我吧，我会解救你，你要赞美我。”这几句话很适合我的情况，所以一读到它们，我的脑海里就留下了印象，虽然此时的印象并没有后来那么深。至于被“解救”，我可以说，这句话对我没有意义。据我了解，这是遥不可及的，也是不可能的。所以我开始问道，就像以色列的孩子们在有人答应给他们肉吃的时候总问的一样：“上帝能在荒野里摆宴席吗？”我也问道：“上帝能亲自把我从这里解救出去吗？”因为很多年都没有任何希望出现，所以这个问题也经常出现在我的脑海里；然而对这些话我有很深的印象，也时常地琢磨它们。天已经黑了，像我说的那样，烟的味道使我昏昏沉沉地想睡觉。于是，我让洞穴里的灯继续点着，以防半夜我可能会需要些什么，然后我就上床睡觉了。但是在我躺下之前，我做了一件我以前从来没有做过的事情——我跪下来向上帝祈祷，祈求他实现对我的承诺，那就是：如果我在遇到麻烦时呼唤他，他就会解救我。做完了我这断断续续又不太完整的祷告之后，我喝了泡有烟叶的朗姆酒。其味道如此强烈而刺激，我几乎无法下咽。一喝完，我就上床睡觉了。不久我就发现酒劲直冲脑门，但是我还是睡着了，而且睡得很香，直到第二天才醒，根据太阳的位置判断，那时肯定将近第二天的下午三点钟了——不仅如此，直到现在，我还是怀疑第二天的白天黑夜我都睡过去了，现在是第三天的下午，如果不是这样，在我多年之后计算时间的时候，我怎么会在那一周里少了一天。如果是我来回穿过赤道造成的，我应该少了不止一天的时间。但我的确在记录里丢了一天，而且永远都不知道是怎么丢的。但是，不管怎么样，当我醒来时，我发自己充满了活力，精神高涨。起床后，我感觉比前一天要强壮，胃里也舒服多了，因为我感到饿了。简言之，第二天，我没有任何病症，而是变得越来越好。这是二十九日。</td>
		<td class="en">I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure both for soul and body.I opened the chest, and found what I looked for, the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found leisure or inclination to look into.I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no: but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other.I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first almost stupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been much used to.Then I took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as almost for suffocation.In the interval of this operation I took up the Bible and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these, “Call on Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.”These words were very apt to my case, and made some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being DELIVERED, the word had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat, “Can God spread a table in the wilderness?”So I began to say, “Can God Himself deliver me from this place?”And as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often.It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went to bed.But before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life—I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfill the promise to me, that if I called upon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver me.After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that I could scarcely get it down; immediately upon this I went to bed.I found presently it flew up into my head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o’clock in the afternoon the next day—nay, to this hour I am partly of opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost three the day after; for otherwise I know not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost more than one day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued much altered for the better.This was the 29th.</td></tr>

Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness—from the most distressed condition that could be, and that was so frightful to me?And what notice had I taken of it?Had I done my part?God had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him—that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance?This touched my heart very much; and immediately I knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey of the island itself.I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore.I found after I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of running water, very fresh and good; but this being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it—at least not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived.On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk.There were divers other plants, which I had no notion of or understanding about, that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out.I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could find none.I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand them.I saw several sugarcanes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect.I contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field; at least, very little that might serve to any purpose now in my distress.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The next day, the sixteenth, I went up the same way again; and after going something further than I had gone the day before, I found the brook and the savannahs cease, and the country become more woody than before.In this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.The vines had spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich.This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers.But I found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and agreeable to eat when no grapes could be had.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but I bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我曾经提到过，我留下了几穗大麦和水稻，而且也惊讶地发现它们都出土发芽了。我猜想，它们是自己长出来的。我估计有三十株水稻，二十株大麦。我想，现在是种植它们的好时节，因为雨季已过，太阳的位置正向南移动。于是，我用我的木铲子尽力开垦出一片地，把它们分成两部分，把种子种到了地里，但是播种时，我无意间想到，开始的时候，我不应该把它们全都种上，因为我还不知道究竟此时是不是播种的最佳季节，所以我只种了大约三分之二的种子，每样留下了一把。后来看，这对我是一个极大的安慰，因为我种的种子没有长出任何东西。因为接下来就是旱季，种子种下后就没有下过雨，土里没有一点水分来促进它们生长，所以它们根本没有出土，直到雨季再次来临，它们才发芽，好像是刚种到土里似的。知道了第一批种子没有发芽之后（我很容易想到是因为干旱），我又找了一块更湿润的地方做了尝试，而且，在我的新居附近开垦了一块地。在二月份，也就是比春分稍早一点的时候，把剩余的种子种在了土里。这次三四月份的雨水浇灌了土地，所以庄稼长势喜人，收成也很好，但是因为我只剩一部分种子了，我没敢把所有的种子都种上，所以最终只收获了一点点的谷物，每一样都不到一加仑。但是这次的尝试让我变得精于此道，精确地知道什么时候是播种的最佳季节，也知道每年我都可以播种两次和收获两次。</td>
		<td class="en">I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from me.Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for it, so I sowed about two thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to anything: for the dry months following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal equinox; and this having the rainy months of March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind.But by this experiment I was made master of my business, and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed times and two harvests every year.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >谷物生长的时候，我还有了一个小发现，后来对我很有用处。雨季一过，大约是在十一月份，天气开始稳定下来，我又去了一次我的乡间茅屋。虽然我几个月没有去那里了，但是我发现所有的东西和我上次离开时是一样的。不仅我建造的围栏或者说双层篱笆坚固完整，而且我从附近一些树上砍下来的木桩也都发芽抽枝了，就像是修剪过的柳树第二年又长出很多新枝一样。我不知道自己用来做木桩的那些树叫什么名字。看到这些小树生长，我既惊讶又高兴。我修剪它们，让它们尽量长得一样。很难相信，三年之后，它们长得多么好看。虽然篱笆墙围成一个直径约为二十五码的圆，但是这些树（我现在可以这么叫它们）不久就把篱笆都盖了起来，形成了一整片的阴凉，足以让我在整个旱季居住。这使我决心再多砍一些树桩，也像这样做一个篱笆，形成一个半圆，环绕在我的墙外（我是指我第一个住处的墙外），而且我也确实这样做了。我在离篱笆大约八码的地方安置了两排树或者说树桩。它们不久就开始生长，一开始就很好地把我的住处掩盖，而且，后来还起了防御作用，这些我以后会适时讲述。</td>
		<td class="en">While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use to me afterwards.As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the country to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I found all things just as I left them.The circle or double hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head.I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from.I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years; so that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happened to blow, but this was the general observation I made.After I had found by experience the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand that I might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months.This time I found much employment, and very suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion for many things which I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application; particularly I tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing.It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket maker’s, in the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner in which they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials, when it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallow, willows, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try.Accordingly, the next day I went to my country house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them.These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for use I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had occasion; and though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took care never to be without them; and as my wicker ware decayed, I made more, especially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days; and now I changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what they were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemption.In the midst of the greatest composure of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a child.Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two together; and this was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在我开始有了新的想法：我每天读《圣经》，把其中所有的安慰运用到我现在的处境中。一天早上，我十分悲伤地翻开了《圣经》，读到了这些话：“我永远永远都不会离开你，更不会放弃你。”我马上认识到，这些话是写给我的。在我对自己的处境感到悲伤，感觉自己是被上帝和人类抛弃了的时候，为什么它们就正好在那里？“那么，好吧，”我说，“如果上帝不抛弃我，即使全世界抛弃了我，又会有什么后果，又有什么关系？从另一种角度去看，如果我拥有了世界，却失去了上帝的关爱和保佑，那么这种损失又如何比拟呢？</td>
		<td class="en">But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words, “I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”Immediately it occurred that these words were to me; why else should they be directed in such a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken of God and man?“Well, then,” said I, “if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the world should all forsake me, seeing on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no comparison in the loss?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible for me to be happier in this forsaken, solitary condition than it was probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in the world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place.I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.“How canst thou become such a hypocrite,” said I, even audibly, “to pretend to be thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?”So I stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent.I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">To this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time.For example, I was full two and forty days in making a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a sawpit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world here; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, nor the pride of life.I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now capable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had possession of: there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised ship loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion.I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and then one was as much as I could put to any use: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me?If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them but for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >简言之，事物的本质和经验，让我经过思考明白了一个道理：这个世界上所有的好东西除了为我们所用之外，就没有什么意义了。不论我们积攒了什么东西赠与别人，我们只能享受能为我们所用的，不会更多了。世界上最贪婪、最吝啬的守财奴，如果处于我的位置，也会把贪婪的恶习矫正的，因为我拥有的东西比我知道怎么处理的东西要多得多。我别无所求，只是想要一些我没有的东西，而且它们都是一些微不足道的东西，但是，却对我极有用处。像我之前提及的那样，我有一袋子的钱，有金子也有银子，大约有三十六磅的钱币。唉！这些毫无用处的东西可怜地放在那里，我没有办法使用它们。我经常想，我愿意用一把金子换回一打烟斗，或者是换一方磨盘来磨谷，我也会用所有的钱来换回价值六便士的英格兰芜菁和胡萝卜种子，或者一把豆子和一瓶墨水。事实如此，我虽然有金银，却没有任何用处，也不能从中受益。它们就放在抽屉里，在雨季那潮湿的洞穴里，慢慢地失去光泽。如果我的抽屉里都是钻石，也会是同样的结果——它们对我来说没有任何价值，因为没有用处。</td>
		<td class="en">In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther good to us than they are for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more.The most covetous, griping miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of covetousness if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with.I had no room for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use to me.I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling.Alas!there the sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no more manner of business for it; and often thought with myself that I would have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco pipes; or for a hand mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for a sixpenny worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink.As it was, I had not the least advantage by it or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case—they had been of no manner of value to me, because of no use.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在我的生活状况比起开始的时候，变得很安逸，不仅思想上轻松多了，身体也是。我经常充满感激地坐下来吃肉，对上帝的安排钦佩无比，因为是他在荒野里为我铺了宴席。我学着多看看我的处境中阳光的一面，少看它阴暗的那面，也学着去多想想我所拥有的，而不是我想要的，这悄悄给了我安慰，我无法表达。我注意到这一点，也想提醒那些不满足的人们：他们不能舒适地享用上帝已经给予他们的东西，因为他们总是看到并贪图那些上帝没有给予他们的东西。我们对自己所需要之物的不满足，似乎起源于对我们所拥有的一切缺乏感激之情。</td>
		<td class="en">I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in it than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body.I frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of God’s providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness.I learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them, because they see and covet something that He has not given them.All our discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一个想法对我也很有用，而且，毫无疑问，对所有处于像我这样的处境的人来说也都是一样有用的，这就是，把我现在的处境和我开始所预想的比一比。如果上帝没有精妙地安排我的船被冲到靠近海岸的地方，那情况会是什么样的。现在我不仅能靠近船，还能从船上拿出很多东西来安慰和救助自己。没有这些，我就缺乏工作用的工具、防身用的武器以及捕食用的火药和子弹。</td>
		<td class="en">Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was, to compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would be; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my food.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself, in the liveliest colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing out of the ship.How I could not have so much as got any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must have perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships and misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, “Is any affliction like mine?”Let them consider how much worse the cases of some people are, and their case might have been, if Providence had thought fit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我还有一种想法，也使我的精神有了安慰和希望，即把我现在的处境和我应该得到的处境相比，然后，我就有理由期盼上帝的安排了。我曾经过着糟糕的生活，对上帝完全没有认识和敬畏。我的父母曾经谆谆教导过我，他们早先曾试图向我的头脑中灌输有关敬畏上帝的宗教思想，提醒我做人的职责，以及人的本质和人生的目的。但是，唉！我过早地开始了航海生涯，而这种生活又最缺乏对上帝的敬畏，虽然上帝的威慑无时不在，我是说，我过早地开始了航海生活，过早地加入了海员队伍，所以我仅有的那点宗教信仰也在同伴们的嘲笑声中消失得无影无踪了。　我越来越鄙视危险和死亡，因为我已经习惯于长时间地只和那些和我一样的人交谈，听不到任何关于宗教的言论。</td>
		<td class="en">I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind with hopes; and this was comparing my present situation with what I had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of Providence.I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of God.I had been well instructed by father and mother; neither had they been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the nature and end of my being required of me.But, alas! falling early into the seafaring life, which of all lives is the most destitute of the fear of God, though His terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that little sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse with anything but what was like myself, or to hear anything that was good or tended towards it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had attended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me—had not only punished me less than my iniquity had deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me—this gave me great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >想到这些，我坚定了信念：不仅要在现在的处境中接受上帝的安排，而且要为此虔诚地感激上帝，只要我还活着，就不应该抱怨，鉴于我并没有因为自己的罪恶而受到应有的惩罚。我还享有了自己在那里本没有理由奢望的仁慈。我不应该再抱怨自己的现状，而应该感到欣喜，每天都感激上帝给了我面包，因为面包只能说是很多奇迹的结果。我应该知道自己能吃饱是一个奇迹，甚至和以利亚靠吃乌鸦活下一样，那也是一系列奇迹的结果。在这个世界上，我几乎说不出任何一个无人居住的地方，会比我所流落的这个小岛对我更有利了。在这里，我没有社交往来，一方面来说这让我很痛苦，但是另一方面我也发现这里没有凶猛的野兽、凶残的恶狼或猛虎威胁我的生命。这里也没有有毒的动物，或其他吃了会让我中毒的毒物，更没有野人会杀死我或把我吞食。一句话，虽然一方面，我的生命充满了痛苦，而另一方面它也充满了仁慈。我不需要任何让我过上舒服日子的东西，只是希望能够感知上帝对我的恩惠，以及他在如此处境里给予我的关爱，使我每天得到安慰。当我刚刚在这些事情上取得些许进步之后，我就停下了，而且不再悲伤。现在我已经在这里很长时间了，所以我带到岛上的很多东西不是差不多没有了，就是被消耗了很多，或者快用光了。</td>
		<td class="en">With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that place; that I ought never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought; that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens, nay, by a long series of miracles;and that I could hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world where I could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where, as I had no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous creatures, or poisons, which I might feed on to my hurt; no savages to murder and devour me.In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to be able to make my sense of God’s goodness to me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily consolation; and after I did make a just improvement on these things, I went away, and was no more sad.I had now been here so long that many things which I had brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very much wasted and near spent.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat; I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand.I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition.I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a rising ground to look farther; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was all one; I could see no other impression but that one.I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot—toes, heel, and every part of a foot.How it came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to be a man.Nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented things to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), I fled into it like one pursued.Whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning, for never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was now a great way off.Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil, and reason joined in with me in this supposition, for how should any other thing in human shape come into the place?Where was the vessel that brought them?What marks were there of any other footstep?And how was it possible a man should come there?But then, to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place, where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it—this was an amusement the other way.I considered that the devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced entirely.All this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then that it must be some more dangerous creature—viz. that it must be some of the savages of the mainland opposite who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as I would have been to have had them.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些混乱的想法让我彻夜未眠，但第二天早晨，我睡着了。由于思虑过度，身心疲惫不堪，这一觉睡得很沉。醒来之后，我觉得冷静多了，甚至比以往任何时候都要镇定。这时，我开始冷静思考。在与自己一番辩论后，我得出这样一个结论，这座小岛（风景宜人、物产丰富，离我之前看到的那片大陆也不算太远）并不像我想象的那样荒无人烟。虽然这里目前并没有固定的居民，但有时也会有人驾船从对岸过来。有些人可能是有计划的，还有些人或许并非故意，而是被侧风吹到这里来的。到现在为止，我已经在这个岛上生活了十五年，连个人影都没见过。即使某些时候真的有人被风浪刮到过这里，但当他们发现这里无论何时都不适合定居时，便很有可能想尽办法尽快离开了。现在，我所面临的最大危险，也只是偶尔会有几个对面大陆上掉队的人无意间来到这里。他们很有可能是被风吹过来的，并非出于自愿，所以他们不会在此逗留，而是会设法以最快的速度离开。很少有人会在岛上过夜，因为如果海潮退了，天也黑了，他们就无法回去了。所以，现在我什么也不必做，只需想好一条安全的退路，以防在岛上碰到那些野蛮人。</td>
		<td class="en">This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been as it were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much better composed than I had ever been before.And now I began to think sedately; and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this island (which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the mainland than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine;that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might come to this place;that I had lived there fifteen years now and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet; and that, if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion;that the most I could suggest any danger from was from any casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again with all possible speed;seldom staying one night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon the spot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，我开始非常后悔自己把山洞挖得太大了，还必须穿过一道门才能进去。而这道门，正如我上面说过的，突了出来，超过了我的堡垒与岩石的连接处。因此，经过一番深思熟虑，我决定在离围墙有一段距离的地方再挖一个半圆形的堡垒，也就我曾经提过的，大约十二年前我种那两排树的地方。这些树原本就种得密密麻麻，只需在中间再打一些树桩，它们就会长得更茂密、更粗壮，我那新堡垒的围墙很快就能完成了。那么现在，我就有两道墙了。为了使外墙更牢固，我用了许多木料、旧缆绳，还有所有我能想到的东西来加固它。我还在墙上挖了七个小洞，洞口的大小差不多刚好够我把胳膊伸出去。在围墙内侧，我不断地从山洞里挖出一些土来，搬到墙角下踩实，从而把墙加厚到约十英尺厚。那七个小洞则是准备放置火枪的，一共七把，都是我从那条船上拿上岸的。我把这七条火枪像大炮一样支起来，像安在炮架上似的放到洞里，这样我就可以在两分钟内连开七枪。我辛辛苦苦干了好几个月才完成了这堵墙，直到修好之后，我才真正感到自己安全了。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock:upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention: these trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that they might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.So that I had now a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at.In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick with continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship;these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes’ time; this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >完成这些后，我在墙外所有空地上，也就是在围墙四面大片范围内的空地上，密密麻麻地插满了柳树桩或者柳条，看起来像个小树林。之所以种柳树，是因为它非常容易生长。这么看来，我种了将近两万根柳树桩和柳条，并在它们和我的围墙之间留出了很长一段距离，这样我就有足够的空间看清楚敌人，而且如果他们想靠近外墙的话，也没有小树可以掩护。</td>
		<td class="en">When this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand;insomuch that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样的话，两年以后，我就可以拥有一片茂密的小树林；五六年之后，我的住所前就会出现一片无比茂密而粗壮的森林，那里将完全无法通行。无论什么人都想不到树后面竟然还会有东西，更不可能想到有人会住在那里。我没有留通往住所的路，而是装了两架梯子，作为我进出的通道。一架梯子靠在岩石的较低处，岩石上有个凹进去的地方，正好有空间放第二架梯子。所以，只要我把两架梯子都撤走，就没有人能够毫发无伤地来到我的面前。再说，就算他们过来了，也还是被挡在墙体之外。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus in two years’ time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years’ time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what kind soever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation.As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down no man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >进行这些工作的时候，我也并未完全忽视其他的事，我还十分关心我那一小群山羊。对我而言，它们不仅是现成的、随时可以充分满足我需要的食物来源，节省了火药与子弹，还能免去追捕野山羊的辛劳。我不愿意失去它们带给我的便利，也不愿意再重新驯养它们一次。</td>
		<td class="en">While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为此，我想了很久，结果只想出两个保全它们的办法：一是另找一个合适的地方挖个地洞，每天晚上把它们赶进地洞里；另一个办法就是再圈两三块小一点的地，间隔大一点，而且要尽量隐蔽，在每处养六七只小羊。这样一来，万一以后羊群遇到什么灾难，我就能够用较少的时间重新驯养它们，也不会太麻烦。虽然这样做可能要耗费很多的时间和体力，但我觉得这个计划最为合理。</td>
		<td class="en">For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave underground, and to drive them into it every night;and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in each place;so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time: and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为此，我花了点时间寻找岛上最隐蔽的处所。后来我相中了一个地方，正如我所希望的那样，它的确相当隐蔽。那是一小块湿地，位于一片中空而浓密的森林中央。如我所说，之前我曾尝试从岛的东部经过这里往回走，差点在这里迷了路。在这里，我找到一块大约三英亩大的空地，环绕四周的是茂密的树林，几乎就是个天然的畜栏。至少，我不用像在另一块地方那样费很大的力气修一个畜栏了。</td>
		<td class="en">Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish: it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the island.Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least, it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other piece of ground I had worked so hard at.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我立刻在这块地上干了起来。不到一个月，四周就修好了篱笆，我的羊群或者说兽群，随你怎么叫，在里面已经可以非常安全了，它们现在已经没有当初那么野性十足了。所以，我一点儿都没耽搁，马上就把十只小母羊和两只小公羊迁了过去。迁过去之后，我继续修缮篱笆，直到把它修得像第一个那么牢固为止。然而，我修第一个篱笆时更从容一些，花的时间也比后来这个长很多。</td>
		<td class="en">I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than a month’s time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further delay, I removed ten young she goats and two he goats to this piece, and when they were there I continued to perfect the fence till I had made it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我大费周折地做这些事，完全是因为我看到了人的脚印，并由此产生了种种恐惧。事实上，到现在为止，我还从没见过任何人靠近这座岛。我就这样惶惶不安地过了两年，这种不安确实让我的生活远不如之前那么舒适安逸。任何一个人，只要他了解长期生活在对其他人的恐惧情绪中是怎样的情形，他都能想象出我的现状。还有件令人痛心的事：我发现，这种不安的心情也严重影响到我的宗教观念。由于时时刻刻都在担心，生怕自己落入那些野蛮人或者食人族的手中，我几乎没什么好心情向上帝祈祷；至少不再像过去习惯的那样，在祈祷时心境平和；相反，每次祈祷时，我都精神痛苦、心情压抑，总觉得危机四伏，每晚都担心会在天亮之前被人谋杀，并被人吞掉。从我个人的经验来看，我不得不说，平静、感激、爱和崇敬的心情远比恐惧和不安的心情更适合祈祷。人在害怕大祸临头时的祈祷，无异于在病床上的忏悔，是不适合向上帝祈祷以求安慰的，因为这些不安情绪会影响心灵，犹如疾病会影响身体一样。心灵的不安肯定也是一大缺陷，其危害性绝不亚于，甚至超过肉体上的缺陷。向上帝祈祷，准确地说，是一种思想上的行为，而不是身体上的行为。</td>
		<td class="en">All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a man’s foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near the island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man.And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker;at least, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before morning;and I must testify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure；and that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sickbed; for these discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body;and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater; praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the body.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还是来接着讲我的故事吧。在把一部分小家畜安置好之后，我在整个岛上转了一圈，试图再找一个像这样隐蔽的地方来养羊。我一直往西走，一直到了我从来没去过的地方，向海上望了望，我发现遥远的海面上似乎有一条船。我曾在一个水手用的箱子里找到了一两只望远镜，我把它们从船上抢救了出来，但现在不在身边。虽然我一直盯着远处的那个东西，直到眼睛痛得没法再看下去，但是距离实在太远，说不清那是什么。我不知道那到底是不是船，但我从山上下来后就再也看不到它了，所以也就不再多想。不过我也由此决定，以后出门一定要随身带着望远镜。我从山上下来，来到岛的尽头，事实上我从没来过这个地方。到了这里，我很快就确信，在岛上看到人的脚印这件事并不像想象中的那样奇怪。只是，由于上帝的刻意安排，我被放逐到岛的另一头，野人们从没去过的那一头。否则，我应该很容易就会知道，没有什么比有小船从大陆过来这件事更稀松平常了。偶尔这些船在海上飘得有点太远时，也会驶到岛的那一边停泊。同样，他们的船经常会相遇，然后双方开战。胜利者会把所有的俘虏带到这个岛的岸边，在那里，他们会按照食人族那些可怕的习俗，把俘虏杀死吃掉。有关食人族的事情我之后再说。</td>
		<td class="en">But to go on.After I had thus secured one part of my little living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private place to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance.I had found a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer;whether it was a boat or not I do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in my pocket.When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man’s foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined:and but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour:likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正如我上面说的，当我从山上下到海岸边，也就是岛的西南角之后，我简直吓得魂飞魄散、目瞪口呆，也根本无法向你们形容当时我心中的那份恐惧：我看到海岸上满地都是人的头骨、手骨、脚骨，还有人体其他部位的骨头。尤其是，我看到一个地方曾经生过火，地上还挖了个像斗鸡场似的圆圈。据我推测，那些野蛮的恶棍大概就是围坐在这里举行宴会，吃自己同类的身体吧。</td>
		<td class="en">When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the SW. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;and particularly I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their fellow creatures.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看到这一幕，我万分惊愕，以至于在很长一段时间里，我都完全意识不到任何外界对自身的威胁：因为我满脑子都想着这种极端残忍的、令人毛骨悚然的野蛮行为，还有人性堕落带来的恐怖。虽然之前也常听人说起吃人肉这事，但从没有如此近距离地亲眼目睹这样一个场面。总之，我转过脸去，不愿再看这一可怕的场景。我的胃很难受，人也快要晕倒了，然后很自然地，我把胃里那些乱七八糟的东西全吐了出来。我吐得相当厉害，吐完之后才稍稍感觉好了一点，但我一刻也无法在这里呆下去了，所以我又以最快的速度跑上山，朝自己的住所走去。</td>
		<td class="en">I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle;my stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still awhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these;and that, though I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of: and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of His blessing:which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我怀着这种感激的心情回到了城堡，现在我对自己的安全感到轻松多了，比以往任何时候都要放心，因为我发现，这些恶棍永远不会为了寻找他们想要的东西而到岛上来。也许，他们到这里来根本就不是要寻找什么、需要什么，或者期望能得到什么，但毋庸置疑的是，他们经常会在岛上茂密的树林处登陆，却从未找到他们想要的任何东西。我知道，到现在为止，我已经在岛上住了快十八年了，之前从来没在岛上看见过任何人的脚印。如果我不想暴露自己，还可以像现在这样把自己完全隐蔽起来，在岛上再住十八年。更何况，我是绝对不会暴露自己的。我现在唯一要做的事就是尽可能完好地将自己隐蔽在这里，除非我找到一种比食人族更文明的人类，才会与他们交往。我对上面谈到的那些野蛮的食人族，以及他们那互相吞食的残忍而灭绝人性的恶习感到深恶痛绝。之后，我继续整日沉思，心情愁苦，丝毫不敢走出我那小小的活动范围，就这样过了快两年。我所说的活动范围是指我的三处庄园，即城堡、乡村别墅（我把它叫做凉亭），以及树林中的畜栏。其中，照看畜栏只是为了养羊，别无它用。因为我天生就非常憎恶那些魔鬼般残忍的食人族，所以我害怕看到他们，就像害怕看到魔鬼一样。在此期间，我再也没去看过那只小船，而只是想再造一只，因为我再也不想尝试把那只船绕过小岛弄到我住的这边来，以免在海上遇到那些食人族。若我真是那样，很不巧地落到他们手中的话，我非常清楚自己的命运将会如何。</td>
		<td class="en">In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what they could get;perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered, woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose.I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human creature there before; and I might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this:when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations—viz. my castle, my country seat (which I called my bower), and my enclosure in the woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than an enclosure for my goats;for the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself.I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of making another; for I could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea; in which case, if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，时间一久，再加上我很满意地发现自己并没有被那些人发现的危险，于是我对他们的不安开始慢慢消失。我又开始像以前一样从容不迫地生活，但有一点不同，那就是我比以前更加谨慎，更加留意周围的情况，以免碰巧被某个食人者看到。尤其是开枪的时候，我会更加小心，唯恐哪个上了岛的野蛮人碰巧听到了枪声。所幸我之前驯养了一批山羊作为供给品，这样我就不必再去树林周围打猎，也不用再射杀野山羊。如果此后我还能逮到野山羊的话，那也是用捕具和陷阱逮到的，就像我曾经做过的那样。所以，在这之后的两年里，虽然每次出门都带着枪，可我确信我从没开过一枪。此外，我曾从那艘破船上救出三把手枪，出门时我也总是把它们随身带着，或者至少带两把，就插在羊皮皮带里。我又将一把从破船上拿来的大弯刀磨得发亮，也用一条带子把它别在腰间。现在我出门时，样子看起来实在非常可怕：除了我之前描述过的那身装扮外，现在还特别加了两把手枪，以及一把从腰带上垂到身侧的没有刀鞘的大刀。</td>
		<td class="en">Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it.It was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before;so that for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went out without it; and what was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goatskin belt.I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description of myself the particular of two pistols, and a broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >日子就这样持续了一段时间，除了增加这些谨慎的措施外，我似乎又回到了从前那种从容不迫、平静安详的生活状态。所有这些似乎越来越多地证明，与其他一些人相比，我的情况实在算不上悲惨，尤其是与上帝可能让我遇到的其他许多事情相比。于是我开始反思：如果人们愿意把自己的处境与处境更糟的人相比，心中充满感恩，而不是和那些处境更好的人相比，并伴随着嘟囔和抱怨，那么，无论在什么样的生活状况下，人们的抱怨都会少之又少了。</td>
		<td class="en">Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way of living.All these things tended to show me more and more how far my condition was from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other particulars of life which it might have pleased God to have made my lot.It put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among mankind at any condition of life if people would rather compare their condition with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以目前的情形来看，我真正需要的东西并不多，所以我确信，正是由于对这些野蛮的食人族的恐惧，以及对自身安全的思虑，我从前拥有的、为自己生活的便利而进行创造的才能已全部消失了。我曾认真考虑过一个很好的计划，想试验一下，看能不能把大麦制成麦芽，然后自己酿些啤酒，但现在这个计划也放弃了。这实在是个异想天开的想法，就连我自己也经常责备自己把事情想得过于简单，因为我很快就发现，还缺少一些酿酒所必需的东西，自己也没法造出来。首先要有装酒的木桶，正如前面说过的，我总是做不好。虽然我曾经花了好几天、好几周，甚至好几个月去尝试，结果都失败了。其次，没有能使酒经久不坏的啤酒花，没有可用来发酵的酵母，也没有用于煮沸的铜锅铜罐。尽管缺这么多东西，但我还是坚信，要不是对野蛮人的恐惧干扰，我肯定已经开始行动，说不定现在都已经酿成了。因为一旦我决定了要做什么事，在没有完成之前，我极少会半途而废。可现在，我的创造才能却朝着另外一个方向发展。唯一一件我昼夜不停地思考的事就是：如何才能趁着这些食人恶魔举行他们那残忍血腥的宴会时杀死他们中的一些，如果可能的话，再救出他们带到岛上准备杀害的受害者。为了消灭这些野蛮生物，或至少吓唬吓唬他们，防止他们再来岛上，我想了很多计划。如果真要把我头脑中策划的计谋，或者说是苦思冥想的结果一一记下来的话，估计会比这整卷书还要厚。但所有这些都失败了——除非我亲自去实施，否则根本不可能有任何作用。再说，他们很可能二三十个人一起，个个带着标枪或弓箭，他们射箭都像我开枪一样准，我一个人夹在他们中间，又能做什么呢？</td>
		<td class="en">As in my present condition there were not really many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention, for my own conveniences;and I had dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and that was to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer.This was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer that it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could never compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose.In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to made it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not the frights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had it in my head to begin it.But my invention now ran quite another way; for night and day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of the monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment, and if possible save the victim they should bring hither to destroy.It would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more:but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时我想，如果在他们生火处的下面挖个洞，放进五六磅火药，那么当他们点火时，肯定就会引爆这些火药，把周围的一切全都炸毁。可是，首先，我不愿把这么多火药浪费在他们身上，我现在剩下的火药也不到一桶了；再说我也不太确定火药是否会在特定的时间爆炸，这样好吓他们一跳。还有，这些火药最多也只是把火星溅到他们耳朵上，让他们受点惊吓，却不足以让他们放弃这块地方。因此，我把这个计划搁置一旁。后来又想到，我可以埋伏在一个合适的地方，给三支枪都装上双倍的弹药，在他们血腥仪式的中途向他们开枪，这样我敢保证每枪打死或打伤两三个。然后，我就带着我的三把手枪和一把刀冲上去，假如只有二十个人，我肯定能把他们全部杀光。这个幻想让我一连高兴了好几周，我时时刻刻都想着这件事，就连做梦也梦到，有时还梦到我就要向他们开枪时的情景。我对这个计划疯狂地着迷，甚至花了好几天的时间去寻找一个我所说的合适的埋伏地点来监视他们。我还经常去他们吃人的地方，现在我对那里已经越来越熟悉了。这时，我满脑子想的都是复仇和用刀把二三十个野蛮人全部杀死，我在这里受到的惊吓（我或许可以这样说），以及看到这些野蛮的家伙互相吞食所留下的痕迹，让我怒火中烧。最后，我在山坡上找到一处很满意的藏身之地，我可以安全地等在那里，直到他们的船靠近。即使在他们准备上岸之前，我还可以躲到树丛里去，其中一棵树上有个树洞，足够把我整个人藏进去。我可以坐在那里，观察他们残忍的行径，然后当他们聚到一起时，我便瞄准他们的头，肯定能打中目标，而且第一枪准能打伤三四个。于是，我决定在这里实施我的计划，为此我准备了两把火枪，还有一把我常用的猎枪。两支火枪每支都装了双弹丸，还装了四五颗大概手枪子弹那么小的子弹；猎枪上则装了几乎一整把猎天鹅用的特大号鸟弹。此外，我给每支手枪装了大概四颗子弹，还准备了充足的弹药供第二和第三次射击使用。就这样，我完成了战斗前的准备。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes I thought if digging a hole under the place where they made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all that was near it:but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might surprise them;and, at best, that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it aside;and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient place, with my three guns all double loaded, and in the middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill them all.This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often dreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.I went so far with it in my imagination that I employed myself several days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me;but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice.Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely;and there I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so close together as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot.In this place, then, I resolved to fulfill my design; and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling piece.The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling piece I loaded with near a handful of swan shot of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and, in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >制定好计划，并在脑子里一遍遍演练之后，我每天早上都会跑到离我所谓的城堡三英里或更远处的一座小山顶上巡视一番，看看海上是否有船来到了小岛附近，或是正从远处朝小岛驶来。这样的守望持续了两三个月之久，在这期间，我每次都是无功而返。不仅海岸上或海岸附近始终没有船，就是拿眼睛或望远镜向四周眺望，也无法在整个海面上找到任何船的影子。因此，我开始有点厌倦这份苦差事了。</td>
		<td class="en">After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three miles or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over towards it;but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my watch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not, in all that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach every way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在每天到山上巡视的这段期间，我决意要实施我的计划，所以始终精力充沛、情绪高涨，似乎随时都能狂暴地杀死二三十个赤身裸体的野人。至于他们的罪行，我却完全没再想过，只是起初看到这里的人有如此伤天害理的风俗时，恐惧点燃了我的怒火。上帝对世界的管理固然英明，但他似乎已经放弃指引这里的人们，任凭他们按照自己那令人憎恶的、腐败堕落的冲动来行动。结果，很可能几个世纪以来，他们就这样被放任自流，干着这些骇人听闻的勾当，理所当然地传承着这种可怕的风俗。正是由于遭到天堂的彻底遗弃，也由于他们自己毫无人性的堕落，才使他们落到今天这种地步。可是，正如我说过的，我每天早上跑到那么远的地方去巡视，结果每次都是无功而返，我开始对这种徒劳的巡视感到厌倦。所以，我对这个计划本身的看法开始改变，我开始更加沉着冷静地思考自己要做的到底是什么。我想：既然这么多世纪以来，上帝都认为让他们像上帝判决的执行者一样互相残杀是合适的，也不予惩罚，那我又有什么权利或使命去扮演法官和执行者，将这些野人作为罪犯来处决呢？这些人究竟有什么地方冒犯我了吗？我又有什么权利去参与他们之间错综复杂的血腥之战呢？我经常这样和自己辩论：“要是上帝自己遇到这个特殊的案例，我又怎么知道他会怎样处理呢？当然，这些人彼此残杀之时，并不认为自己在犯罪，他们这么做并没有违背自己的良心，因此也不会遭受良心的谴责。他们不知道吃人是犯罪，是在无视神圣审判的情况下犯了罪，这跟我们犯下大多数罪行时的情况一样。我们认为杀牛不是犯罪，同样地，他们觉得杀死战俘不是犯罪；又或者，我们觉得吃羊肉不是犯罪，同样地，他们觉得吃人肉也不算犯罪。”</td>
		<td class="en">As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, to look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all entered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions;and consequently were left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them into.But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself began to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in;what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on, and to be as it were the executioners of His judgments one upon another; how far these people were offenders against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously upon one another.I debated this very often with myself thus: “How do I know what God Himself judges in this particular case?It is certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it is not against their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching them; they do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do to kill an ox; or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我这样稍稍想了一下，就觉得自己肯定弄错了。如果从过去我心目中谴责的杀人犯这个意义上来说，他们和基督徒一样算不上杀人犯，那些基督徒也经常把战场上抓到的俘虏处死。或者更常发生的是，在多数情况下，他们会把成群的俘虏毫不留情地全部杀死，即使他们已经缴械投降。接下来我又想，虽然这些野人之间的残杀是那么残忍且毫无人性，但这一切和我真的没有任何关系。这些人从来没伤害过我，要是他们想伤害我，或者在我觉得必要之时，为了及时自卫而向他们发动进攻，这还算说得过去。但要是我还没被他们逮到，甚至他们都还不知道我的存在，因此也不打算谋害我，如果这时我向他们发动进攻，就有点说不过去了。如果我这样做了，就等于承认那些西班牙人在美洲实施的所有暴行都是正当的。他们在美洲杀死了数百万当地土著人，这些土著人都是偶像崇拜者，也是野蛮民族，他们的风俗中也确实有一些血腥残忍的仪式，比如用活人祭祀他们的偶像。但不管怎样，对于西班牙人来说，他们都是无辜的。在那段时期，每当谈起西班牙人这种种族灭绝的行径，欧洲所有基督教国家的人们，甚至是西班牙人自己都充满了极端的憎恶和痛恨，认为这纯粹是一场屠杀，一种残忍、血腥、毫无人性、人神共愤的暴行。正因如此，“西班牙人”这个名称对所有具有人道主义思想和基督教同情心的人来说，都变成了一个可怕的字眼，好像西班牙王国专门出产这样残酷不仁、对悲惨的人毫无怜悯之心的人，而同情怜悯之心被公认为慷慨仁慈的标志。</td>
		<td class="en">When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers, in the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their arms and submitted.In the next place, it occurred to me that although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no injury: that if they attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon them, something might be said for it: but that I was yet out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and consequently no design upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them;that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their barbarities practiced in America, where they destroyed millions of these people; who, however they were idolators and barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people;and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man;and for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible, to all people of humanity or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the mind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以上种种考虑确实使我暂时停止了攻击野人的计划，或者说，我给这一行动画上了句号。就这样，我开始一点点地放弃我的计划，并总结出攻击野人这一决定是错误的。除非他们先攻击我，否则我就不该去动他们，而且如果可能的话，我应该尽量阻止他们攻击我。但是，如果我被他们发现并受到攻击，我也知道该怎样做。另一方面，我对自己说,攻击野人这个计划不但不能拯救自己，反而会将自己彻底毁灭，除非我确保能把当时岸上所有的人，以及此后所有来岛上的人都一一杀死。否则，只要有一个人逃了回去，并告诉他的乡民们岛上所发生的一切，到时侯，就会有成千上万的野人再次上岸，替死去的同胞报仇，那我定将在劫难逃。而目前，我还不会遇到这种情况。总而言之，我最后总结出：不管是在原则上还是策略上，无论采取这样或那样的方法，在这件事上，我只需管好自己就行。我所要做的，就是想尽一切办法将自己隐蔽起来，不让他们看到，而且不能留下任何蛛丝马迹，免得他们猜出岛上可能还存在任何生物——我指的是人。这个谨慎的决定也唤醒了我的宗教信仰。现在种种考虑都使我相信，我之前制定的所有要毁灭无辜生灵的残忍计划已经完全背离了我的职责——我所说的“无辜”是指他们对我而言是无辜的。至于他们对彼此犯下的种种罪行，则和我一点关系都没有。这些罪行具有全民性质，我应该将其交给上帝来公平裁决，因为上帝才是万民的统治者，他知道该采取何种全民性惩罚来公正地补偿全民罪行所造成的伤害，并以他最满意的方式来公开判决这些在光天化日之下犯罪的人。现在，我已经完全清楚了，我最欣慰的事就是我并没有去行动，因为现在我完全有理由相信，如果我真的这么做了，那么我所犯下的罪行无异于蓄意谋杀。于是我跪了下来，以最谦卑的态度向上帝致谢，感谢他把我从那血腥的罪行中拯救出来，同时恳求上帝能保佑我，保佑我不会落入这些野蛮人的手中，也保佑我不会对他们动手，除非我听到上帝更为清晰的召唤，让我发动进攻以保护自己的生命。</td>
		<td class="en">These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full stop; and I began by little and little to be off my design, and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the savages; and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent: but that, if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty.On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at that time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country people what had happened, they would come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at present, I had no manner of occasion for.Upon the whole, I concluded that I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one way or other, to concern myself in this affair: that my business was, by all possible means to conceal myself from them, and not to leave the least sign for them to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island—I mean of human shape.Religion joined in with this prudential resolution; and I was convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures—I mean innocent as to me.As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them; they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows how, by national punishments, to make a just retribution for national offences, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by such ways as best please Him.This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of willful murder if I had committed it;and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that He had thus delivered me from blood guiltiness; beseeching Him to grant me the protection of His providence, that I might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后，我就在这样的心态下又过了将近一年。因为我已经完全不再想攻击这些残忍的人们，所以在这段时间里，我再没去过那座小山观察他们的踪迹。我也不知道他们中是否有人曾经从那里上过岸，这样我就不会被引诱再次实施之前那个攻击野人的计划，也不会在任何有利条件出现的诱导下去偷袭他们。这期间我做的唯一一件事，就是把原本停在岛另一侧的小船移到了岛的最东头。我偶然在一些高耸的岩石下发现了一个小湾，于是我就把船藏了进去。因为那里有急流，所以我知道那些野人无论如何都不敢、也不愿意驾船过来。虽然没必要把船清空了去那里，可我还是把所有之前留在船上的东西都搬了下来——也就是我制作的桅杆和船帆，还有一个有点像锚的东西，但事实上，它称不上是锚，也算不上是抓钩。但是，这已经是我倾尽全力所能达到的最高水平。我把船上所有的东西都搬了下来，这样他们肯定什么都找不到，岛上既没有任何船只的影子，也找不到任何有人居住的痕迹。除此之外，如前面所说，我比以往更加深居简出。现在除了做一些日常的工作，比如给母羊挤奶，还有照看树林里那一小群山羊之外，我几乎很少出门。而羊群位于小岛的另一边，距离很远，所以也不会有危险。当然，虽然那些野人偶尔也会来到岛上，但他们从来没想过要在岛上寻找什么东西，所以从来不会远离海岸在岛上游荡。但我毫不怀疑，在我对他们的恐惧使我变得处处警觉之后，这些野人肯定又来过岛上好几次，在那之前也是。实际上，如果当初我真的攻击他们，并且在那之前就被他们发现的话，那我现在会是什么样的状况——每次回想起这个，我都有几分后怕。那时我赤手空拳，没有任何装备，除了一把装有几枚小子弹的枪，就这样在岛上四处游荡，东张西望，看能找到什么东西。如果当时我看到的不是一个人的脚印，而是十五或二十个野人，那我该是多么诧异。他们肯定会追捕我，而他们箭步如飞，我绝对不可能从他们手中逃脱！有时，一想起这个，我就会被吓得魂不附体，心中难过得好久都缓不过神来。我简直无法想象那时我会怎么做，因为我不仅无力抵抗，甚至会因惊慌失措而自乱阵脚。当时我能做的，肯定比现在这经过深思熟虑和充分准备的措施要少得多。事实上，认真思考这些事后，我就会心情低落，有时这种情绪可能会持续很长一段时间。但最后，我总是会想到上帝，感谢他把我从那么多无法预料的危险中拯救出来。他还帮我从那些凭我自己的力量绝对无法躲过的灾难中逃了出来，因为那些灾难是我丝毫没意识到的，也是永远无法预料到的。这时，过去常有的一种思绪重回心头。当生活中出现各种危险时，我开始明白，上帝对我们是很仁慈的，有时我们在毫不知情的情况下就能神奇地逃过劫难。有时，当我们陷入所谓的两难境地，内心怀疑或犹豫着该走这条路还是那条路时，一种神秘的提示会指引我们走这条路，而非我们原来所想的那条路。不仅如此，当我们的感觉、愿望或者任务召唤我们走那条路时，一个不知从何而来的奇怪念头又会突然出现在脑海中，凭借一种莫名的力量指引我们走到这条路来。后来的结果也会证明，要是我们真的走了原先想的、或是想象中认为应该走的那条路，那我们很可能早就迷失方向，走向毁灭了。想到这些，以及许多诸如此类的事情后，我便明确规定自己，一旦脑海中出现了关于某件事该不该做，或是关于走这条路还是走那条路的神秘提示或冲动时，我都必须坚决服从这一神秘的指示，虽然我知道，这样做的唯一理由只是心中某种暗示或冲动的驱使。我可以举出许多我生活中的例子来说明这种服从给我带来的成功，我流落到这不幸的小岛之后的生活尤其能够说明这一点。此外，如果我过去也能以现在这样的眼光来看待人生的话，肯定还会注意到许多其他例子的。但是，什么时候变得明智都不算太晚。我不得不建议所有爱深思熟虑的人们，不管你们的生活是像我的一样充满种种非同寻常的变故，抑或是并无特别之处，都千万不要忽视上帝赐予的各种神秘启示，不管它们源于哪只不可见的神明之手。关于这点，我不打算在此讨论，或许也没法解释，但有一点可以肯定的是，它们可以作为证据，证明不同的灵魂之间可以沟通，有形物与无形物之间可以进行神秘的交流，这一证据永远无法被推翻。如果有机会，我将用我在这个可怕小岛上寂寞的后半生中的一些值得注意的事例来证明这一点。</td>
		<td class="en">In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be provoked by any advantage that might present itself to fall upon them;only this I did: I went and removed my boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats upon any account whatever.With my boat I carried away everything that I had left there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither—viz. a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called either anchor or grapnel;however, it was the best I could make of its kind: all these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow for discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon the island.Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment, to milk my she goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was out of danger;for certain, it is that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came with any thoughts of finding anything here, and consequently never wandered off from the coast, and I doubt not but they might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well as before.Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been if I had chopped upon them and been discovered before that; when, naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island, to see what I could get;what a surprise should I have been in if, when I discovered the print of a man’s foot, I had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their running no possibility of my escaping them!The thoughts of this sometimes sank my very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much that I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might have done; much less what now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might be able to do.Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it all at last into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposition of its being possible.This renewed a contemplation which often had come into my thoughts in former times, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it;how, when we are in a quandary as we call it, a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that way:nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business has called us to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule us to go this way;and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that way, which we should have gone, and even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost.Upon these and many like reflections I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of mind to doing or not doing anything that presented, or going this way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew no other reason for it than such a pressure or such a hint hung upon my mind.I could give many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my life, but more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions which it is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I see with now.But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisible intelligence they will.That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for;

		<td class="en">I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences.I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than that of my food.I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard: much less would I fire a gun for the same reason: and above all I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray me.For this reason, I removed that part of my business which required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I daresay, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个地穴的出口位于一块大岩石下，如果我没有足够的理由把这一发现完全归于天意，那我只能说它纯属意外。那一天，我正在砍一些粗树枝，准备烧些木炭用。在我继续讲之前，我必须说明一下我为什么要烧这些木炭，事情是这样的——我不敢在住所附近生火，害怕冒出烟来，正如上面所说。可是如果不烤面包，不煮肉，我就无法在那里生存，所以我就设法像之前在英国看到的那样，先拿些木柴放在草皮底下烧，等木柴烧成焦炭或者干煤后把火熄灭，把干煤保存好带回家，遇到其他需要用火的时候就可以拿来烧，还不会有冒烟的危险。但这只是顺便提一下。那天我正在这里砍柴，突然在一片非常厚的矮草丛或是灌木丛的树枝后面发现了一处空的地方。我感到很好奇，就想进去看看，费了好大的劲儿才从洞口钻了进去，结果发现这个洞穴相当大，也就是说，足够让我挺直腰板站在里面，甚至还可以再站一个人上去。可是，我也不得不承认，我刚一进去就迅速逃了出来，因为我朝地穴深处望了一眼，洞里漆黑一片，借着洞口处直射进来的微弱光线的反射，我只能看见某种生物的两只发亮的大眼睛，一闪一闪地像两颗星星，也不知那是人还是鬼。可是，不一会儿我又冷静了下来，连骂自己是个大傻瓜，同时想到，谁要是怕鬼，谁就不配独自在孤岛上生活二十年。而且我敢说，或许我才是这洞里最可怕的东西。想到这些，我就鼓起勇气，手拿火熊熊燃烧的火把，再次钻进洞里。可我还没走进去三步，就几乎又像之前一样害怕起来。因为我听到了一声非常响亮的叹息声，就像正在承受某种痛苦的人发出的叹息声一样，紧接着是一串时断时续的噪音，有点像支支吾吾的说话声，之后又是一声深长的叹息。我感到十分诧异和恐惧，连忙往后退，浑身直冒冷汗，要是当时头上戴帽子的话，我的头发肯定会被吓得立起来，把帽子给顶掉。但我还是尽量鼓足勇气，稍稍鼓励自己说，上帝无处不在，无所不能，他一定会保护我。于是我把火把稍稍举过头顶，继续往前走，借着火光，我看到地上躺着一只大得吓人的老公羊，它老得快要死了，正在那里努力地喘着气。我推了推它，看看是否能把它弄出去，它尝试要站起来，可实在是站不起来了。于是我心想，就让它躺在那里吧——既然它能吓到我，那它一定也能吓到那些费劲想要闯进来的野人们，只要它还活着。</td>
		<td class="en">The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal;and before I go on I must observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which was this—I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking my meat, so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other services for which fire was wanting, without danger of smoke.But this is by-the-bye.While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or under wood, there was a kind of hollow place: I was curious to look in it; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me:but I must confess to you that I made more haste out than I did in, when looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the cave’s mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection.However, after some pause I recovered myself, and began to call myself a thousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone; and that I might well think there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myself.Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps in before I was almost as frightened as before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again.I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off.But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life, and, dying, indeed, of mere old age.I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with myself he might even lie there—for if he had frightened me, so he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时我已经从惊诧的情绪中恢复过来，开始环视四周，发现这个洞其实非常小——也就是说，洞高不过十二英尺左右，不成什么形状，不圆也不方，也没有任何人工斧凿的痕迹，完全是一个天然而成的洞穴。我还发现，在洞穴尽头有个地方通往更深处，但那个地方太矮了，我只有趴在地上才能从那里爬进去。至于洞到底通向哪里，我就不知道了。由于当时没带蜡烛，我就没有进去，但我决定第二天带上蜡烛、火绒箱以及一盘燃烧剂再去一次。那个火绒箱是我自己用一支火枪的枪机做成的。</td>
		<td class="en">I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when I found the cave was but very small—that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere Nature.I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not; so, having no candle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved to go again the next day provided with candles and a tinderbox, which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，第二天我来到了地穴，并带上了我亲手制作的蜡烛（现在我已经能用羊脂做出非常好的蜡烛，但烛芯的制作有点费劲，有时是用破布或者绳线做的，有时则用荨麻之类野草的外皮晒干了来做）。上面我也说过，要钻进那个低矮的地方，必须四肢着地爬进去，我就这样爬了十码左右——顺便说一句，我觉得这是一次相当大胆的冒险，因为我既不知道这个洞可能有多深，也不知道洞的尽头是什么。穿过那条通道后，我发现洞顶突然高了很多，我猜有将近二十英尺。我环视了一下这个地窖，或者叫洞穴的四壁和洞顶——只见两支蜡烛的光照在壁上，反射出万道光芒，我敢说自己以前从没在岛上见过这样壮观的画面。至于岩石里是什么——可能是钻石或其他什么宝石，或者我猜很可能是金子——我就不得而知了。我所在的这个洞虽然漆黑一片，但却是最令人赏心悦目的洞穴或者石窟。地面干燥平坦，表面覆盖着一层松松的细碎沙石，这样就看不到令人作呕的或者有毒的生物，洞顶和洞的四周也没有任何湿气。而它唯一的问题就是洞口——但也正因为如此，才让它变得很安全，使它成为我想要的藏身之所。这样的缺点，对我来说正是优点。所以，发现这个洞穴让我非常高兴，并当即决定把一些我最不放心的东西搬进这个洞里来。尤其是，我打算把我的火药库，以及所有多余的枪支都搬到这边来——即两支猎枪和三支火枪。我总共有三支猎枪和八支火枪。我在城堡里只留下五支火枪，并把它们全部像大炮一样架在外墙上的小洞里，当我需要出去作战时，也可随时取出来使用。在搬运弹药的过程中，我碰巧打开了那桶从海上救出来的已受潮的火药。我发现火药四周三到四英寸的地方都渗了水，结成了一层牢固坚硬的外壳，将里面的火药完好地保存起来，就像外壳包覆果仁一样。就这样，我从桶中心处弄到将近六十磅非常优质的火药。在那时，这些火药对我来说是个相当可喜的收获。于是我把所有的火药都搬到那里，城堡里只留下不超过两三磅重的火药，以免发生任何意外。同时，我还把所有留着做子弹的铅都搬了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now of goat’s tallow, but was hard set for candlewick, using sometimes rags or rope yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles);and going into this low place I was obliged to creep upon all fours as I have said, almost ten yards—which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it.When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I daresay, as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave—the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles.What it was in the rock—whether diamonds or any other precious stones, or gold which I rather supposed it to be—I knew not.The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof.The only difficulty in it was the entrance—which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted; I thought was a convenience;so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about to this place: particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms—viz. two fowling pieces—for I had three in all—and three muskets—for of them I had eight in all; so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition I happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask.This was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，我觉得自己就像一个古代的巨人，据说他们就住在山洞或岩石上的洞穴里，在那里，没有人能伤到他们。我相信，当我呆在这里时，即使有五百个野人来追捕我，也肯定找不到我——或者说，就算他们找到了我，也不敢贸然在这里对我发动攻击。就在我发现洞穴的第二天，那只喘粗气的老公羊死在了洞口。我发现，就地挖个大坑，把它扔进去用土埋起来，要比把它拖出去容易得多。于是我就把它埋在了那里，以免再闻到那股刺鼻的气味。</td>
		<td class="en">I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out—or if they did, they would not venture to attack me here.The old goat that I found expiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to prevent offence to my nose.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，我已经在岛上生活了二十三年，也完全适应了这个地方以及这里的生活方式，如果我能确定那些野人绝对不会跑到这里来骚扰我的话，我倒是很乐意作出让步，在此度过我的余生，直至生命的最后一刻，就像洞里的那只老公羊一样，躺在这里迎接死亡。同时，我也想出了一些小小的消遣娱乐的方式，这让我的时光过得比以前快活得多——首先，我前面也说过，我教会了鹦鹉波尔说话。现在它说得非常熟练，发音十分清晰，这让我很高兴。它和我一起生活了至少二十六年。我不知道它之后还能活多少年，但据我所知，巴西人有个说法，说鹦鹉可以活到一百岁。我的那只狗也是个可爱的伙伴，非常讨人喜欢，它和我一起生活了至少十六年，最终老死了。至于我的那些猫，我前面说过，它们繁殖了太多的小猫，以至于起初我不得不射杀一些，才能阻止它们吞食我和我所有的物品。到后来，我带来的那两只老猫都死了，再加上有段时间我不断驱赶那些小猫，不喂它们食物吃，最后它们就跑进林子里成了野猫，所以我只把两三只非常喜爱的小猫留在身边驯养。如果它们生了猫崽，我总是会把那些猫崽淹死。以上这些就是我的家庭成员了。此外，我总是在身边养两三只小山羊，教它们从我手里吃东西。我又养了两只鹦鹉，它们也很会说话，也会叫“鲁滨·克鲁索”，可都没有第一只鹦鹉说得好。当然，我在它们身上花的精力也没有像第一只那么多。我还有几只温顺的海鸟，不知道叫什么名字。我在海边逮到它们，剪掉了它们的翅膀。之前在城堡围墙外栽的那些小树桩，如今已经长成一片浓密的小树林，这些鸟就在这些矮树间栖息、繁殖，一切都让我感觉十分惬意。所以，就如前面说的,如果我能确保自己很安全，不会遭到那些野人的攻击，那么我会对现在的生活非常满意。可是，事情总是朝着相反的方向发展，所有读过这部小说的人肯定都会从中得出这样一个正确的结论：在我们的一生中，我们常常竭尽全力想逃避厄运。一旦遭遇厄运，我们就会被吓得半死。但事实往往是，这些厄运本身恰恰就是拯救我们的途径或通道，只有经历这些，我们才可能从正在遭受的痛苦中解脱出来。在我不同寻常的一生中，可以举出许多诸如此类的例子。最明显的便是我在这岛上的最后几年孤独生活中的情景。</td>
		<td class="en">I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and was so naturalised to the place and the manner of living, that, could I but have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave.I had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did before—first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years.How long he might have lived afterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years.My dog was a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age.As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had; but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually driving them from me, and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my family.Besides these I always kept two or three household kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call “Robin Crusoe,” but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with him.I had also several tame sea fowls, whose name I knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have been secured from the dread of the savages.But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story to make this just observation from it: How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into.I could give many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在是十二月，正如我所说，这是我在这里的第二十三年。当时正是冬至日前后（这里的十二月不能叫冬天），正是我丰收的特殊时节，所以我不得不经常出门到田里去。每天早晨，天还蒙蒙亮时，我便要出门了。突然，我吃惊地发现，在离我大约两英里远的海岸上有一片火光，就在之前我发现一些野人上岛的那个地方。但令我极为苦恼的是，火光不是在岛的另一边，而恰恰就靠近我住的这一侧。</td>
		<td class="en">It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when, going out early in the morning, even before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, toward that part of the island where I had observed some savages had been, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works or improvements, they would immediately conclude that there were people in the place, and would then never rest till they had found me out.In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things without look as wild and natural as I could.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，我在围墙里面做好了防御野人袭击的准备。我给所有的大炮都装上弹药——我说的大炮，就是指那几支火枪，它们现在已经架在了我的新碉堡上——我也给所有的手枪装好了子弹，并下定决心，一定要顽强抵抗，直到最后一口气——当然，我也没忘记真心诚意地将自己交付给上帝来保护，虔诚地向上帝祈祷，希望他能把我从那些野人手中拯救出来。我就这样等了约两个小时，然后开始有点不耐烦，急于知道外面的情况，因为我没有可以派出去打听消息的探子。我又在城堡里坐了好一会儿，想了想在这种情况下我该做些什么，最后我再也受不了这样继续呆坐着，而对外面的情况一无所知了。之前我说过，山岩边有块平的地方，于是我把梯子架到山岩旁边爬到那里，然后把梯子从身后抽回来。我又把梯子架在那块平坡上，登到山顶，然后俯卧在地，掏出我特意带来的望远镜，开始寻找刚才那块地方。我立刻发现，那里至少有九个野人，赤身裸体地围坐在一个小火堆旁。他们生火肯定不是为了取暖，因为没那个必要，天已经非常热了。不过我想，他们生火肯定是用来烧烤他们带来的人肉，好做一顿大餐。至于他们带来的人是生是死，我就不清楚了。</td>
		<td class="en">Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence.I loaded all my cannon, as I called them—that is to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification—and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp—not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians.I continued in this posture about two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder after me, I set it up again and mounted the top of the hill, and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.I presently found there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small fire they had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I could not tell.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一看到他们上船离开，我就立刻背上两把火枪，腰带上也别了两支手枪，还在身边挂了一把没有刀鞘的大刀，以最快的速度向第一次发现野人踪迹的那座小山跑去。我花了至少两个小时才到那里，因为我背了太多的武器，跑不快。到了那里，我发现还有满满三艘船的野人。再往远处看，只见他们在海上会合，然后向大陆方向驶去。这一情景让我觉得很恐怖，尤其当我下山走到海岸边，发现了这些野人屠杀后留下的种种恐怖痕迹之后，我更觉得毛骨悚然——所谓痕迹，就是血迹、骨头，以及这些残忍的野人欢天喜地美餐后剩下的一块块肉。看到这情景，我真是义愤填膺，便又开始预谋着，要是下次我再看到他们在那里吃人肉，不管他们是谁，来了多少人，我都一定会把他们全部杀光。后来我发现，他们显然不是频繁地来岛上，因为至少十五个月之后，我才再次看到有人在那里上岸——也就是说，在这段时间里，我再没见过他们，也没看到任何他们留下的足迹或其他什么痕迹。看来，他们肯定不会在雨季出海，至少不会走这么远。但是，在这整段时间内，我都过得很不舒服，因为我时刻都担心着他们可能会突然来岛上偷袭我。由此我悟出一个道理：等待大难临头要比遭遇灾难本身更为痛苦，尤其是当你已经预见灾难即将降临却又无处可逃，或者你的内心充满种种恐惧却又无处排解。</td>

		<td class="en">During all this time I was in a murdering humour, and spent most of my hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should see them—especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties;nor did I consider at all that if I killed one party—suppose ten or a dozen—I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so another, even AD INFINITUM, till I should be, at length, no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters—and perhaps much more so.I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall, into the hands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not without looking around me with the greatest care and caution imaginable.And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of goats, for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew what to expect.However, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon observe.It is true they might have been there once or twice; but either they made no stay, or at least I did not see them; but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four and twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter with them; of which in its place.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我暂时先放下这些不谈。那时正是五月中旬，我想应该是十六号，这是根据我那简陋的木制台历估算出来的，我仍旧每天在柱子上做标记。姑且认为那是五月十六号，刮了一整天的暴风，电闪雷鸣，之后又是一个糟糕的夜晚。我也不知道到底是怎么回事，只记得当时我正在读《圣经》，脑海里正认真思索着自己目前的处境，突然听到一声枪响，我想是从海上传过来的，这让我大吃一惊。这的确是件相当意外的事，与之前所碰到的任何事情的性质都不同，因此我脑中的反应也与之前完全不同。我以可以想象的最快的速度一跃而起，转眼间就把梯子架在岩石边上，爬上了半山腰的那个平坡，然后把梯子收上来，再把它架在平坡上爬到了山顶。就在那一刻，我看到火光一闪，我知道还会有第二声枪响，果然，大约半分钟后，我又听到了第二声枪响。从声音中我判断出，枪声是从上次我坐船被急流冲走的那一带海上传过来的。我立即就想到，肯定有船遇险了，而他们肯定还有同伴，或者其他同行的船只，所以他们鸣枪以示险情，请求支援。那一刻我非常镇定，心想，虽然我帮不了他们，但他们或许可以帮我。于是我收集了附近所有能拿到的干柴，在山上堆成一个很大的柴堆，然后点着了火。柴很干，一点火就烧得很旺。虽然风很大，可火依旧熊熊燃烧，因此我确信，只要海上有船，就肯定能看得到。毫无疑问，他们看到了，因为我刚把火点着，就又听到一声枪响，之后还响了好几声，都来自同一个地方。我把火整整烧了一整夜，直到破晓时分。等天大亮后，天空开始放晴，我看到在小岛正东方向的海上很远的地方好像有什么东西。到底是帆还是船，我说不上来——不，就是用望远镜也看不清楚。距离实在太远了，天还是有点灰蒙蒙的，至少海面上是如此。</td>
		<td class="en">But to waive all this for a while.It was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and; a very foul night it was after it.I knew not what the particular occasion of it was, but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea.This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from any I had met with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind.I started up in the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half a minute I heard; and by the sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven down the current in my boat.I immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired these for signals of distress, and to obtain help.I had the presence of mind at that minute to think, that though I could not help them, it might be that they might help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill.The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and, though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it.And no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that several others, all from the same quarter.I plied my fire all night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish—no, not with my glass: the distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >整整一天，我都不停地看着海面上那个东西，很快就发现它并没有移动，所以我立即断定它是艘抛了锚的大船。你可以想象，当时我是多么急于弄清情况，所以拿起枪就朝着岛的南边，也就是我上次被急流冲走的那些岩石处跑去。到达那里的时候，天已经完全放晴了，我能清楚地看到那是一艘遇难的大船，这让我很是失望。那艘船昨晚撞上了那些暗礁，我上次坐船外出时就发现那些暗礁了。正是这些暗礁阻止了来势汹汹的急流，形成一种逆流，或者叫漩涡，才使得我有机会脱险。那次的险境是我有生以来所遇到过的最绝望无助的一次。由此可见，同样的情况，对一个人来说可能十分安全，对另一个人来说却可能意味着毁灭。不管他们是谁，这些人大概对这里的地形不熟悉，而那些暗礁又完全隐藏在水下，再加上昨夜的东北偏东风刮得很厉害，所以他们才触礁了。如果他们看到了这个岛，我想他们必定会尝试把救生艇划向岸边来自救。但我想他们并没有看到小岛，所以只是鸣枪求救，尤其是看到我点的火之后，更是连连鸣枪，这让我有了很多想法。我首先想到的是，在看到我点的火之后，他们可能上了救生艇，竭尽全力向岸边划。但由于海上风高浪急，他们可能被冲走了。过了一会儿，我想到他们可能早就没有救生艇了，这种情况时常发生，尤其是当船遇到惊涛骇浪时，很多时候，水手们不得不弄破或拆毁救生艇，有时甚至需要亲手把救生艇扔出船外。过了一会儿，我又想，也许他们还有另外一艘或者几艘同行的船，看到他们发出的失事信号后，已经将他们打捞起来救走了。然后我又有了另一种设想，那就是他们可能都从船上下来，坐上了救生艇，但因为遇上了我之前遇到过的那股急流，结果被冲离小岛，在浩瀚的海洋上漂浮。要真是这样的话，留给他们的将只剩痛苦和毁灭，也许这时他们正想着自己快要饿死了，甚至开始想着要吃掉别人。</td>
		<td class="en">I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where I had formerly been carried away by the current;and getting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat;and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in all my life.Thus, what is one man’s safety is another man’s destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at ENE.Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat; but their firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts.First, I imagined that upon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured to make the shore: but that the sea running very high, they might have been cast away.Other times I imagined that they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways; particularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands.Other times I imagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress they made, had taken them up, and carried them off.Other times I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the current that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by this time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat one another.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所有这些充其量只是我的猜想，而以我目前的处境，我什么都做不了，只能眼睁睁地看着那些可怜的人们受苦，为他们感到遗憾。这件事对我产生了一些积极的影响，我现在有越来越多的理由去感谢上帝，感谢他让我在孤寂中依然能非常幸福而舒适地生活着。因为到目前为止，已经有两艘船在世界的这个角落遇险，而除我之外，似乎再无一人生还。从这件事中，我再次学着去领悟这个道理：虽然在极个别情况下，上帝会将我们置于极其恶劣或悲惨的处境中，但我们依然可以从中看到某些值得感激的事，并看到其他人身处的境况可能比我们更为不幸。很显然，这些人就属于这种情况，我实在难以想象他们中有人能死里逃生，也没有任何适当的理由希望或期待他们有人生还。唯一的可能性就是他们被同行的另外一艘船搭救了。但这种可能性存在的几率实在太小了，因为我根本看不到任何有人搭救的征兆或者痕迹。在看到这一情景后，我实在难以用语言来表达当时我内心那种奇妙而又强烈的渴望，有时甚至会脱口而出：“哦，要是有一两个人，不，就算只有一个人能从船上逃出来也是好的，他可以逃到我这里来，这样我就会有个伴，有个同类跟我说说话、聊聊天啊！”在我孤身一人生活的这么多年里，我从来没有如此真切、如此强烈地渴望能与同类交往，也从来没有如此深切地感到遗憾，遗憾自己没有一个同伴。</td>
		<td class="en">As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two ships’ companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life should be spared but mine.I learned here again to observe, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts us into any condition so low, or any misery so great, but we may see something or other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances than our own.Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance of any such thing.I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a strange longing I felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus: “Oh that there had been but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion, one fellow creature, to have spoken to me and to have conversed with!”In all the time of my solitary life I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my fellow creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There are some secret springs in the affections which, when they are set a going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracing of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.Such were these earnest wishing that but one man had been saved.I believe I repeated the words, “Oh that it had been but one!” a thousand times;and my desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and my fingers would press the palms of my hands, so that if I had had any soft thing in my hand I should have crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would strike together, and set against one another so strong, that for some time I could not part them again.Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner of them.All I can do is to describe the fact, which was even surprising to me when I found it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded; it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow Christians would have been to me.But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade it; for, till the last year of my being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck.He had no clothes on but a seaman’s waistcoat, a pair of open kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of.He had nothing in his pockets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe—the last was to me of ten times more value than the first.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">These thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give over my enterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on; upon which my going was impracticable for so many hours.Upon this, presently it occurred to me that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same rapidity of the currents.This thought was no sooner in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the currents or sets of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my return.Here I found, that as the current of ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north side of the island in my return, and I should do well enough.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Encouraged by this observation, I resolved the next morning to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my canoe, under the watch coat I mentioned, I launched out.I first made a little out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done before, so as to take from me all government of the boat; but having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it.It was a dismal sight to look at; the ship, which by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks.All the stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by the board—that is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm.When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come to me.I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst.I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.After this I went on board; but the first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another.I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under water.Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life; or any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water.There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too big to meddle with.I saw several chests, which I believe belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them into the boat, without examining what was in them.Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good voyage; for by what I found in those two chests I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess from the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the Brazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to anybody; and what became of the crew I then knew not.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了这些箱子以外，我还找到满满一小桶酒，大概有二十加仑，我费了好大的力气才把它搬到我的小船上。船舱里有几支火枪，还有一个装了约四磅火药的大角筒。因为不需要这些火枪，所以我把它们留在那里，只带走了那个装有火药的角筒。我还带走了一把火炉铲和一些火钳，这正是我急需的东西。此外还有两个黄铜小水壶、一个煮巧克力的铜锅，以及一个烤架。载着这些货物和那条狗，我离开那艘船准备回家。此时，潮水开始推着我的船返航——当天晚上天黑后不到一个小时，我就回到了岛上，人已疲惫至极。那天晚上，我在船上睡了一夜。第二天早晨，我决定把运回的东西藏进新发现的那个洞穴里去，而不是带回城堡。我振作精神，把所有货物搬到岸上，开始仔细地进行检查。我发现，带回来的那桶酒是一种朗姆酒，但又不同于我们之前在巴西喝的那种——总之，一点都不好喝。可是，我打开那两只箱子后，发现里面有几件东西对我很有用——比如，我在其中一个箱子里找到一个精致的小酒箱，里面装有好几个酒瓶，小巧别致。酒瓶中是上等的提神酒，每瓶约三品脱，瓶盖是银制的。</td>
		<td class="en">I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty.There were several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder horn, with about four pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took the powder horn.I took a fire shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely, as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again—and the same evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree.I reposed that night in the boat and in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it home to my castle.After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars.The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils; and, in a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the chests, I found several things of great use to me—for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped with silver.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此外还有两罐上好的蜜饯甜食，罐口封得很紧，所以海水没有渗进去泡坏它们。而另外两罐同样优质的蜜饯就被海水泡坏了。我还找到了几件质地不错的衬衫，这正是我求之不得的东西，还有约一打半白色亚麻手帕和彩色领巾。亚麻手帕也是我十分需要的，大热天用来擦脸会非常清爽。除此之外，我还在箱中的钱匣里找到三大袋西班牙银币，总共一千一百枚左右，其中的一个袋子里还有用纸包着的六枚达布隆金币和一些小块的条形或者楔形的金子，我估计这些钱加起来得有一磅重。我在另一个箱子里找到一些衣服，但都不怎么值钱，看情形，这应该是副炮手的。箱子里没多少火药，除了两磅研细抛光了的火药粉，分装在三个小瓶子里，大概是猎枪上用的。总之，这次航行没有带回多少对我有用的东西，至于钱币，我根本就没有机会使用。对我而言，这些钱就像脚下的泥土一样分文不值。我宁愿用所有的钱去换三四双英国产的鞋子和长袜，这些才是我迫切需要的东西，而我已经有好多年没穿过鞋袜了。我确实也弄到了两双鞋子，是我从破船上那两个被淹死的水手脚上脱下来的。此外，我在其中一个箱子里又找到两双鞋，这当然也是我求之不得的。但这两双鞋并不像我们英国的鞋子那样舒适耐穿，也不像我们平常走路穿的那种鞋子，而更像是一种便鞋。我还在这个水手的箱子里找到大约五十枚西班牙银币，但没有任何金子。我想，这个箱子肯定属于一个穷水手，而另外一个箱子似乎是某个高级船员的。然而，我还是把所有这些钱都拖进我的洞穴里，像之前藏我自己那艘船上带来的钱一样把它们藏好。但非常可惜的是，正如我之前提过的，我没法进入沉船的其他部分。因为，如果可以进入船的其他部分，我就能把钱装满小船，一趟趟地运回岸上。我想，要是以后能逃回英国，把钱藏在这里也是非常安全的，有机会可以再回来取。</td>
		<td class="en">I found two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the saltwater had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled.I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neck cloths; the former were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day.Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.In the other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner’s mate; though there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling pieces on occasion.Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on my feet for many years.I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes.I found in this seaman’s chest about fifty pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I supposed this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer.Well, however, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I had brought from our own ship; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my share: for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times over with money; and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I come again and fetch it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Having now brought all my things on shore and secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet.I began now to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much;and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go without so many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went the other way.I lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable, was all these two years filled with projects and designs how, if it were possible, I might get away from this island:for sometimes I was for making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another—and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither.I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are touched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their miseries flow:I mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and Nature hath placed them—for, not to look back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my ORIGINAL SIN, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my coming into this miserable condition;for had that Providence which so happily seated me at the Brazils as a planter blessed me with confined desires, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been by this time—I mean in the time of my being in this island—one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils—nay, I am persuaded, that by the improvements I had made in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had remained, I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores—</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, Nature—as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of it—threw me into a sound sleep.One would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to it, but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought with them another savage whom they were going to kill in order to eat him;when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I thought in my sleep that he came running into my little thick grove before my fortification, to hide himself;and that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him;upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant;and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, “Now I may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what places to venture into, and what to shun.”I waked with this thought; and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great dejection of spirits.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我也从中得出个结论：如果我想逃离这个荒岛，唯一的办法就是尽全力去得到一个野人。如果可能的话，这个野人最好是个其他野人带来准备杀害吃掉的俘虏。但要把这些想法付诸行动还是这样一个困难：除非我能攻击一大队野人，并把他们全都杀光，否则这些计划是不可能实现的。这样做不仅是孤注一掷，而且很可能会出差错，除此以外，我对这种做法的合法性也深怀顾虑。再说，即使这样做是为了拯救自己，但一想到要杀那么多人，流那么多血，我内心还是感到战栗不安。我没必要再重复一遍我不该主动去攻击野人的种种理由，因为之前已经说过了。此外，现在我还可以例举许多其他的理由，比如说，那些野人是我的死对头，有可能的话，他们肯定会吃了我的。再说，我这样做也是最大程度上地保护自己，是为了拯救自己免被杀害，是正当自卫，因为如果他们真要袭击我的话，我就不得不进行自卫，诸如此类的理由还有很多很多。虽然有这么多的理由支持我这么做，但只要一想到非得杀人流血才能使自己获救，我就感到非常恐怖。在好长一段时间内，我一点也无法感到安心。那时，我内心经过了多次激烈的斗争，同时，由于各种理由在头脑中斗争了很久，我也感到十分困惑。然而，到了最后，想拯救自我的热切渴望战胜了一切；我决定，如果可能的话，我一定要把一个野人搞到手，即使花多大的代价也在所不惜。接下来要做的，就是制定一个实施计划，而这个计划也真的是很难决定。因为想不出个可行的办法，所以我决定守候观察，看看他们什么时候上岸，剩下的事暂且不管，顺其自然吧，到时候再见机行事。</td>
		<td class="en">Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only way to go about to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage into my possession: and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill.But these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty: that it was impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them all;and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance.I need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the same mentioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now—viz. that those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could;that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like;I say though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means reconcile myself to for a great while.However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into my hands, cost what it would.My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve on; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity should present, let what would be.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >决定这样做以后，我便开始尽量经常在四周巡视。事实上，巡视的次数过于频繁，以至于后来我感到极其厌烦；因为这一等就等了一年半以上。那时，我大部分时间都会去岛的西端，也几乎每天都到西南角去，看看有没有船只出现，可在这么长的时间里我连一只船都没见到。虽说这一次，我没有像上次那样完全放弃希望（之前有一段时间我的确是完全放弃了），可是我真的是感到失望至极，并开始心烦意乱起来。不过，似乎时间耽搁得越久，我的渴望就越强烈。总之，这次与上次不同，我不再是处处小心，不再避免看到野人和被野人看到，相反，我现在是急于想和他们碰面。此外，我还在想，如果能弄到野人，我就完全有能力驾驭，不管是一个，甚至是两三个，都没问题，我可以让他们完完全全地变成我的奴隶，我指挥他们做什么，他们就得做什么，而且不会让他们有任何的机会伤害到我。这个想法着实让我高兴了好长一段时间。可是后来什么事都没发生。所有这一切都只不过是幻想而已，所有的计划也无法实施，因为很长的一段时间内都没有野人出现。</td>
		<td class="en">With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily tired of it; for it was above a year and a half that I waited;and for great part of that time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared.This was very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I cannot say that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off the edge of my desire to the thing;but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt.It was a great while that I pleased myself with this affair; but nothing still presented itself; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >自从有了这些想法之后，我就成天想着他们，但由于没机会将他们付诸实践，所以一直是毫无结果。就这样又过了一年半。一天早上，我惊讶地发现，至少有五艘独木舟一起在岛上我住的这边靠了岸，船上的人们全都上了岸，但却不见踪影。他们一下来这么多人，把我的计划全都打乱了。以前我知道，他们来的时候，一般会有四或六个人坐一条船，有时可能会更多，可现在一下子看到这么多野人，我都不知该怎么办才好，也不知道，我单枪匹马的，该怎样对付这二三十个敌人呢？所以，我只能悄悄躲进我的城堡中，坐立不安，却又不知所措。不过，我还是按先前制定好的计划，随时准备投入战斗，只要一有机会，便立刻采取行动。我就这样等了好久，并一直仔细聆听他们的动静，最后，实在是不耐烦了，我干脆把枪放在梯子脚下，跟往常一样，分两步爬到山顶。虽然是站着，但我尽量不把头露出山顶，确保他们无论如何也不会看到我。我借助于望远镜看到，那里至少有三十个野人。他们现在已经点着篝火，正在烤肉。至于他们是怎么烤的，烤的是什么肉，我就不清楚了。但他们正围着火堆尽兴地跳舞，随心所欲地做着各种各样我从没见过的野蛮难看的姿势。</td>
		<td class="en">About a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execution), I was surprised one morning by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight.The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted.However, I put myself into the same position for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for action, if anything had presented.Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and .clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any means.Here I observed, by the help of my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed.How they had cooked it I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正在这时，我从望远镜中看到，两个可怜倒霉的野人被他们从船上拖了出来，他们俩估计是事先就被放在船上的，现在被拉出来准备屠杀了的。我看见，他们其中一人立刻就倒下了。我猜，他可能是被木棍或木刀打倒的，因为这就是野人们的习惯做法。另外两三个野人立刻一拥而上，将他开膛破肚，准备煮了吃。而另外那个受害者则被单独留在那里站着，等他们准备好了再拿他开刀。就在那一瞬间，这个可怜的家伙，看到自己没被绳子绑着，没人管他，出于求生的本能，他一跃而起，撒腿就跑，以惊人的速度沿着沙滩朝我这个方向直奔过来。我的意思是说，朝着海岸上我住处的那个方向直奔过来。我必须承认，当我看到他往我这边跑来时，我感到非常害怕，尤其是当我想到，那群野人必然会全部出动来追捕他。此时，我料想到，我梦想的一部分即将实现，他必然会躲进我城堡外的那片树林里。但是，至于我梦境中的其他部分，也就是其他野人不会追到那边，也不会在那里发现他，我是无论任何也不敢相信的。</td>
		<td class="en">While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter.I perceived one of them immediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that was their way; and two or three others were at work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him.In that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty and unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me; I mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation was.I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove;but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the other savages would not pursue him thither and find him there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我还是站在原地，按兵不动，当我看到只有三个人来追他时，顿时感到精神振奋。尤其是，当我发现他比追赶他的那些野人跑得要快得多得多，而且把他们越甩越远了。于是我断定：只要他能再坚持半个小时，就可以彻底摆脱那些追赶他的野人了。</td>
		<td class="en">However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I found that there was not above three men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained ground on them; so that, if he could but hold out for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在他们和我的城堡之间，有个小湾，我在故事的开头部分就曾经多次提到它，我也正是通过这条小湾，把从沉船上运回来的货搬上岸的。我心里很清楚，他必须游过这个小湾，否则这个可怜的家伙就会在那里被捉住。虽然当时正值涨潮，但当这个逃跑的野人跑到湾边时，他就毫不犹豫就纵身跳入水中，只划了三十多下就游过小湾上了岸，之后依旧是以惊人的力量和速度一路狂奔。当那三个野人来到湾边时，我注意到，只有两个会游泳，而另一个却不会游，只能站在对岸看着他的同伴，没再继续向前，之后没一会儿，他便悄悄回去了，他这样做，实在是救了他一命。我看到，那两个会游的野人游得比那个逃跑的野人要慢两倍不止。这时，我脑子里突然冒出一个强烈的、实在无法抗拒的念头：现在这个时候，正是我找仆人的最佳时机，也许他还能成为我的伙伴或者助手呢。这显然是上帝在召唤我去拯救这个可怜的家伙嘛。我立刻从梯子上飞速地爬下来，拿起我那两把枪，之前我也说过，它们就放在梯子脚下。然后我又同样迅速地爬上去，爬到山顶，朝海边跑去。我抄了条近路，一气跑下山坡，横插在追逐者和被追者的中间。我朝着那个正在逃跑的野人大声叫喊，他回过头看了看，一开始似乎也很怕我，其程度绝不亚于害怕那些追赶他的野人，但我向他挥了挥手，示意他过来。同时，我慢慢地朝着后面追上来的那两个人迎面走去。等他们快到跟前时，我一下子冲到前面那个人眼前，用枪柄把他打倒。我不愿开枪，因为不想让枪声被其他的野人听到。虽然说，隔那么远的距离，枪声是不太容易被听到的，就算隐约听到枪声，也看不到枪冒出的烟，不会知道到底发生什么事情了。把这人打倒后，在后面追赶的那个野人就停下了脚步，好像受到了惊吓，我于是快步向他走去。当我走近他时，很快发现他还拿着弓箭，正准备向我射击，所以我不得不先向他开枪，结果一枪就把他打死了。那个逃跑的可怜的野人早已停下了脚步，他虽然看到追他的野人全都倒地毙命，也相信他们必死无疑，但还是被我开枪的枪声和火光吓到了，呆在那里一动不动，既不前进也不后退，尽管他看来宁愿逃跑，也不敢接近我。我再次呼唤他，并做一些手势示意他过来，他能完全明白我的意思，于是就向前走了几步，然后停下来，再往前走了几步，又停下不动。那时我能看到他站在那里，瑟瑟发抖，他以为他又被抓住成了俘虏，也会像他的两个敌人一样被杀掉。我再次向他招手叫他过来，用我所能想到的各种手势鼓励他不要害怕，他这才一步一步朝我走来，而且每走十步，或十二步就跪下来，以此来感谢我的救命之恩。我向他微笑，显出十分和善的样子，示意他再走近一些。最终，他来到我面前，再次跪倒在地上，亲吻大地，把头贴地，然后把我的一只脚放在他头上，似乎在宣誓终生愿作我的奴隶。我把他扶起来，对他非常和气，并尽量鼓励他不要害怕。但是，事情到这还没完。因为我看到之前被我打倒的那个野人并没有死，只是被击昏而已，现在正慢慢苏醒过来。于是我用手指了指那个野人，示意他还没死。他看到后，就对我说了几句话。我虽然没听懂，可还是觉得它们听上去很悦耳。毕竟，这是我上岛二十五年多来，第一次听到除自己声音以外的人类的声音。不过现在没时间去想这些。那个被打倒的野人已经恢复意识，从地上坐起来了，我看到我救出的这个野人马上害怕起来。看到这种情形，我便举起另外一支枪对准那个家伙，准备开枪。这时，我的野人，现在我就这么叫他，向我做手势，示意我把那把挂在腰带上没鞘的刀借给他，我就照他的意思做了。他一拿到刀，就立刻跑到他敌人面前，一刀砍下那家伙的头，动作干净利索，甚至比德国刽子手还要快。这让我大为吃惊，因为我完全有理由相信，在此之前，除了他们自己的木刀之外，他还从未见过一把真正的刀。不过，后来我了解到，他们把木刀做得又锋利又沉重，那种木头非常坚硬，似乎他们甚至能用木刀一刀砍掉人的脑袋或者胳膊之类的。他砍掉敌人的头后，带着胜利的笑容走到我面前，先把刀还给我，接着做出各种各样我不明白的手势，并把砍下的那个野人的头颅放在我面前。但让他感到最诧异的是，我怎么能离这么远就把另外一个野人打死。他指了指那具尸体，向我做着手势，表示要我允许他过去看看，我也尽量用手势告诉他，他可以过去。他走到尸体面前，呆呆地站在那里，两眼直直盯着那具尸体，然后再把它翻来覆去地仔细查看。他看着子弹击中的伤口，伤口好像是在胸口上，子弹是从胸口穿了个洞，血流得不多，因为他是被一枪毙命的，所以血液都流到体内了。他取下那人的弓箭后便返回来。我转身要走，并且示意他跟着我走，我用手比划着告诉他，后面可能会有更多的敌人追过来。他明白我的意思后，就做手势，表示要用沙土把他们埋起来。这样，即使有人追过来，也不会看到他们的尸体。于是我用手势示意他可以这样做。于是，他立刻干起来。不一会儿，他就用手在沙地上挖了一个坑，大小刚好可以把第一个野人埋进去，然后他把尸体拖进坑里，用沙土盖住。第二个野人他也是这么埋的。我相信，他埋这两个野人，总共才用了一刻钟。然后，我招呼他跟我一块儿走，我没带他去城堡，而是去了离这里较远的岛那头的洞穴。我之所以这样做，是不想让我那部分梦境应验，在梦里，他是跑进城堡外的树林里藏起来的。进了洞穴，我给了他一些面包和一串葡萄干吃，还有一些水，因为我发现他跑了那么久，现在真的很需要食物和水。等他吃饱喝足后，我给他指了一个地方，示意他过去躺下休息。我之前已经在那个地方铺了些稻草，上面还放着一条毯子，以前有时我自己也会睡在那里。于是，这个可怜的家伙就躺下睡觉了。</td>
		<td class="en">There was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the ship;and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up;but plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran with exceeding strength and swiftness.When the three persons came to the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it happened, was very well for him in the end.I observed that the two who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled from them.It came very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, and, perhaps, a companion or assistant; and that I was plainly called by Providence to save this poor creature’s life.I immediately ran down the ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed before, and getting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea;and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallowing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened at me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back;and, in the meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece.I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known what to make of it.Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced towards him: but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me: so I was then obliged to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot.The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece that he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come on.I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way; then stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were.I beckoned to him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life.I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length he came close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever.I took him up and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could.But there was more work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he was not dead;upon this he spoke some words to me, and though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a man’s voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years.But there was no time for such reflections now; the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid;but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did.He no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords:however, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even cut off heads with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow, too.When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me.But that which astonished him most was to know how I killed the other Indian so far off; so, pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well as I could.When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one side, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead.He took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him that more might come after them.Upon this he made signs to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to do so.He fell to work; and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered him; and did so by the other also; I believe he had  buried them both in a quarter of an hour.Then, calling away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the farther part of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass in that part, that he came into my grove for shelter.Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for, from his running: and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing him a place where I had laid some rice straw,and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >与其说他睡了一觉，不如说他打了个盹，休息了大概半个小时后，他又醒过来了，跑到洞外来找我。当时，我正在挤羊奶，我的羊圈就在这洞穴附近。一看见我，他就立刻跑到我跟前，再次趴到地上，做出各种稀奇古怪的姿势，极尽所能向我表示谦卑、感激之心。最后，他把头平贴在地上，靠近我脚边，然后又像之前做的那样，把我的另外一只脚放在他头上，之后，他又向我做了各种姿势，以表他的臣服、顺从之心，让我知道他愿一生一世为我效劳。我基本能明白他的意思，然后向他示意我对他十分满意。过了不久，我便开始和他说话，也教他跟我说话。起初，我让他知道，他的名字叫“星期五”，因为我是在那天救了他的命，之所以给他起这样的名字，是为了纪念这个日子。我还教会他说“主人”，让他知道应该这样称呼我。此外，我还教他说“是”和“不是”，并让他知道这两个词的意思。我用瓦罐给他盛了一些羊奶，在他面前演示了一遍我是怎么喝的，并把面包泡在羊奶里吃给他看，同时也给他一块面包，叫他照做，他马上就照办了，并用手势告诉我，东西很好吃。那晚，我整晚都是和他一起在洞穴里睡觉的。不过，第二天一大早，我就示意他跟我一块走，并且让他知道我准备给他一些衣服穿。听懂我的意思后，他看起来很高兴，因为之前他一直是光着身子、一丝不挂的。当走过他埋那两人的地方时，他准确地指出了那个地方，并让我看他之前做的标记，他做标记是方便以后寻找，而且他还用手势告诉我，我们应该把他们挖出来吃了。对此，我表示非常生气，并向他表明，我极其厌恶这种行为，并且做出一想到这种行为就要呕吐的姿势。我做手势叫他离开，他便立即非常顺从地离开了。然后，我带他登到山顶，想看看他的敌人是否已经离开。我拿出望远镜来看，清楚地看到他们先前所在的地方，可是那些野人和独木舟早已不见踪影。显然，他们已经离开岛了，并且把他们那两个同伴留在岛上，都没有去搜寻一下他们。</td>
		<td class="en">After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me: for I had been milking my goats which I had in the enclosure just by:when he espied me he came running to me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great many antic gestures to show it.At last he laid his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and set my other foot upon his head, as he had done before; and after this made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so long as he lived.I understood him in many things, and let him know I was very well pleased with him.In a little time I began to speak to him; and teach him to speak to me: and first, I let him know his name should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life: I called him so for the memory of the time.I likewise taught him to say Master; and then let him know that was to be my name: I likewise taught him to say Yes and No and to know the meaning of them.I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good for him.I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was day I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked.As we went by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he had made to find them again, making signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat them.At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great submission.I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling out my glass I looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no appearance of them or their canoes; so that it was plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind them, without any search after them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，我并不满足于这一发现。现在我已经有了更大的勇气，好奇心也随之大增。于是，我带着我的仆人星期五，交给他一把刀拿在手里，让他背上弓箭，因为我发现他能很娴熟地使用弓箭，再让他替我背一支枪，而我自己则还背了两支枪。于是，我们便动身前往那些野人先前所在的地方，因为我现在非常想获得关于他们的更多情报。当我到了那个地方后，只见眼前一幅骇人的景象，我血管里的血立刻变得冰冷，心也立马沉了下来。那确实是一幅可怕的景象，至少在我看来，是相当的恐怖，可星期五却对此无动于衷。在这里，尸骨遍野，大地都被鲜血给染红了，遍地都是大块大块的人肉，有的被吃了一半，有的被砍烂了，有的被烧焦了。总之，到处都是他们战胜敌人后举行人肉庆功宴的痕迹。我总共看到了三个骷髅、五只手、三四根腿骨和脚骨，还有许许多多其他的人体部分。星期五做手势，让我明白，野人们总共带了四个俘虏来这里来开人肉庆功宴，其他三个已经被吃掉了，而他，他指了指自己，则是第四个。他还告诉我，那些野人和他们的新王爆发了一场大战，而他好像是那个新王的臣民，他们那一边也抓获了大批的俘虏。所有在战斗中被抓获的俘虏都会被战胜者带到不同的地方，在人肉庆功宴上被杀死吃掉，就像那些卑劣的野人把他们带到这里杀死吃掉一样。</td>
		<td class="en">But I was not content with this discovery; but having now more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two for myself;and away we marched to the place where these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some further intelligence of them.When I came to the place my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it.The place was covered with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and there, half eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies.I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth;that there had been a great battle between them and their next king, of whose subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a great number of prisoners; all which were carried to several places by those who had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes.I found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I showed so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it: for I had, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he offered it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他办完这件事后，我们就回到城堡。在那里，我开始为我的仆人星期五的事情忙碌起来。首先我给了他一条亚麻做的短裤，这是我从那艘沉船上可怜的炮手的箱子里找到的，我之前曾经提过这件事。我把它稍加修改，结果穿在他身上非常合适。然后，我又竭尽所能，用羊皮给他缝了件背心（现在我已经变成一个手艺相当不错的裁缝了）。此外，我还给了他一顶我用兔皮做的帽子，戴起来很方便，看起来也很时髦。因此，到现在为止，他的一身打扮看起来已经相当不错，当他看见自己的穿戴几乎和主人一样好时，简直是乐不可支。不过说实在的，一开始穿这些衣服时，他感到行动颇为不便。穿裤子对他来说很别扭，而且，背心的袖筒还把他的肩膀和腋下都磨破了。后来我就把之前他抱怨使他难受的地方稍加放宽，再加上他渐渐习惯了穿衣服，他最后终于喜欢穿这些衣服了。</td>
		<td class="en">When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to work for my man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner’s chest I mentioned, which I found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well;and then I made him a jerkin of goat’s skin, as well as my skill would allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor); and I gave him a cap which I made of hare’s skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master.It is true he went awkwardly in these clothes at first: wearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little easing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to them at length very well.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我和他一块回到我小屋的第二天，我便开始考虑让他住哪里，既要让他住得舒服，又能完全保证自己的安全。于是，我就在那两道墙中间的空地上，也就是在外墙之内、内墙之外的那块地方，帮他搭了个小帐篷。因为那里本来就有一个门，或者叫入口，通向山洞，所以我便在入口稍往里边的那条通道里做了一个正式的门框，还装了一扇木板门。我可以在里面把门打开，到了夜里，我就把门关好，再把梯子也收回来。这样一来，星期五就绝对没办法来到我住的内墙的最里面，如果他想翻墙过来，就肯定会弄出很大的声响，也必然会把我吵醒的。现在我的内墙上有了一个完美的屋顶，能把帐篷全部盖住，这个屋顶是由许多长木条做椽子搭建起来的，搭在山坡上，椽子上还横搭了许多短一点的木棍，而不是木板条，它上面还铺了一层厚厚的稻草，这些稻草就像芦苇梗一样坚硬。而在我用梯子爬进爬出的那个洞口处，我装了扇活板门。如果有人想从外面推门进来，那是绝对不可能的。活板门则会自动掉下来，发出巨大的声响。至于武器，我每天晚上都会把它们全都带在身上。不过，所有的这些预防措施，对我来说，其实根本不需要；因为再也不会有比星期五对我更忠诚、深情而又真挚的仆人了。他从不发脾气、摆脸色，没有图谋不轨，完全任劳任怨，对我百依百顺、忠心耿耿。他在感情上十分依恋我，就好像是孩子对父亲的那种依恋。我敢说，不管在什么时候，他都愿意牺牲自己来救我。此后他也多次证明了这一点，让我深信不疑。很快我就彻底放心，对他我根本就不需要任何的防备措施。</td>
		<td class="en">The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to consider where I should lodge him: and that I might do well for him and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first.As there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed door case, and a door to it, of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and, causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders, too;so that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in getting over that it must needs awaken me;for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill; which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw, which was strong, like reeds;and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a great noise—as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night.But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me: without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged;his very affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a father; and I daresay he would have sacrificed his life to save mine upon any occasion whatsoever—the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions for my safety on his account.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些事情经常会引发我的思考，我总是惊奇地发现，上帝对世事自有安排，在他对其创造的世间万物的治理过程中，尽管他乐于剥夺许多生灵充分使用其才干和良知的权利，他还是会赐予他们同样的能力，同样的理性，同样的情感，同样的善心和责任心，同样嫉恶如仇的情感，同样的感激之心、真诚之心和忠诚之心，以及相互为善的全部能力，而所有这一切都是上帝赐予我们文明人的东西。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而且，当上帝很乐意地为他们提供机会，让他们去表现他赋予他们的所有这些能力时，他们会和我们一样，随时准备好合理充分地利用它们，不仅如此，他们可能会比我们做得更好。有时想起这些，我都会觉得非常抑郁，因为，虽然我们已经拥有这些能力，而且，我们这些能力已经得到上帝圣灵教诲之灯的照明，也获得了圣言的启示，让我们对事物能有更深刻的认识，可是，许多事实也证明，我们这些文明人在利用这些才能时，反而却显得那么卑劣。为什么上帝乐于隐藏这些赎罪的道理，不愿让这成百上千万的生灵知道呢？透过这个可怜的野人，我感觉，与我们这些文明人相比，他们能更好地应用这些道理。由此，有时我会把这些问题想过头，以至于冒犯上帝的统治权，而且，可以说是，指责他对万物的安排任意专断却缺乏公正，他向一部分人揭示他的教诲，而对另一部分人隐藏，但是却期望这两部分人负同样的义务。但我往往会就此打住，并从中得出一个结论：首先，我们不知道上帝是根据什么旨意和律法给这些人定罪的。但是，上帝乃万物之本，它必然是无限神圣、无限正义的。如果这些生物全都被判决，不被赐予这些教诲，那必然是由于他们自己违反了上帝的旨意，违反了《圣经》上所说的他们自身的律法，而上帝的判决则是依据他们良心中公认的正义的法则为标准，尽管我们至今尚未发现这些法则的基础；第二，我们都只不过是上帝这个陶匠手中的泥土而已，没有一件陶器敢对上帝这个陶匠说：“你为什么要把我造成这样？”</td>
		<td class="en">and that when He pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed than we are.This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of His word added to our understanding;and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much better use of it than we did.From hence I sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that sight from some, and reveal it—to others, and yet expect a like duty from both;but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first, that we did not know by what light and law these should be condemned;but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature of His being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, but if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from Himself, it was on account of sinning against that light which, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us; and secondly, that still as we all are the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, “Why hast thou formed me thus?”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我之所以讲述这段谈话，是因为它会引出下文：在和他谈完话以后，我就问他，从我们现在住的这个岛到对面大陆到底有多远，独木舟会不会经常遇险失事。他告诉我说没有危险，也没有独木舟出过事。不过，在出海不远处有股急流和大风，经常是早上一个方向，下午另一个方向。我开始以为，这不过是潮水的流向而已，有时海水往外流，有时往里流。后来我才明白，这是由于一条叫做奥里诺科河的大河倾泻入海，形成回流的缘故。后来我还发现，我们所在的小岛正位于其河口的入海处。而我之前在西面或者西北方向看到的那片陆地，其实是个叫特立尼达的大岛屿，它就位于河口的北方。我还问了星期五成百上千个关于这个区域的问题，这里的居民、海洋、海岸以及附近周围住的民族等。他把他知道的一切一五一十地告诉了我，态度极其坦诚。我又问他，他们的民族那几个部落都叫什么名字，可是他只说出了加勒比人，其他的名字他就不知道了。于是我立刻知道，这些岛应该是加勒比群岛，在我们的地图上，位于美洲地区。这些群岛从奥里诺科河的河口开始，一直延伸到圭亚那地区，然后再往前直至圣马大。他告诉我，在比月亮更远的地方，也就是说在月落处，他们国度的西面，那里住着很多像我一样长着胡须的白人。说到这里时，他还指了指我的大胡子，关于我的大胡子我之前也有提过。他还说，他们还杀了很多白人，这是他的原话。我从他的话中了解到，他指的是西班牙人。这些人在美洲各地的野蛮行径，在各民族中都臭名远扬，并且这些民族的人世世代代铭记于心。</td>
		<td class="en">I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows: that after this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost.He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost: but that after a little way out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon.This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux of the mighty river Orinoco, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, our island lay;and that this land, which I perceived to be W. and NW., was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the river.I asked Friday a thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near; he told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable.I asked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of America which reaches from the mouth of the river Orinoco to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.He told me that up a great way beyond the moon, that was beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before;and that they had killed much mans, that was his word: by all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole country, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island, and get among those white men.He told me, “Yes, yes, you may go in two canoes.”I could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes.This part of Friday’s discourse I began to relish very well; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to help me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，星期五已经和我生活很长一段时间了，在这段时间里，他开始能和我说话，能听懂我的意思了，但我并不想在他心里奠定宗教知识的基础。尤其是，有一次我问他是谁把他创造出来的。他一开始根本没听懂我的意思，还以为我在问他父亲是谁。于是我就换了种方式来问他，是谁创造了大海、我们行走的大地、山峦以及树林。他告诉我：“是由一位远在天边的叫贝纳木基的老人创造出来的。”他不能向我描述这位伟大的人物究竟长什么样子，只是说他很老，他说：“他比海洋和陆地、月亮和群星都还要老。”然后我问他，既然这位老人创造了万物，那为什么万物不都崇拜他呢？他马上变得非常严肃，脸上一副天真无辜的表情，说道：“万物都会对着他说‘哦’。”我接着问，在他的国家里，人死后是不是都会去某个地方？他说：“会的，他们全都去贝纳木基那里了。”我继续问，那些被他们吃掉的人是否也会去那个地方。他说：“是的。”</td>
		<td class="en">During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I did not want to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him one time, who made him.The creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked who was his father—but I took it up by another handle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and the hills and woods.He told me, “It was one Benamuckee that lived beyond all;” he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, “much older,” he said, “than the sea or land, than the moon or the stars.”I asked him then, if this old person had made all things, why did not all things worship him?He looked very grave, and, with a perfect look of innocence, said, “All things say O to him.”I asked him if the people who die in his country went away anywhere?He said, “Yes; they all went to Benamuckee.”Then I asked him whether those they eat up went thither too.He said, “Yes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我从这些事情入手，开始教导他，真正的神其实是上帝。我告诉他，世界万物的伟大创造者就住在天上，并用手指了指天空。上帝凭借神力和神意创造出这个世界，并凭借同样的神力和神意来统治这个世界。上帝无所不能，能为我们做任何事，能赐予我们一切，也能把一切从我们身边夺走。就这样，我渐渐让他看清了事实真相。他聚精会神地听我讲，并乐于接受我灌输的观念。我告诉他，耶稣基督是被派来替我们赎罪的，我们会虔诚地向上帝祈祷，同时也知道，虽然上帝住在天上，但他依然能听到我们的祈祷。一天，星期五告诉我，如果我们的上帝能从比太阳还远还高的地方听到我们的祈祷，那他一定是个比他们的贝纳木基神还要伟大的神，因为他们的贝纳木基神住的地方并不算远。但是，只有当人们爬到他住的那座大山上去跟他讲话时，他才能听到人们的声音。我就问他，他有没有去过山那边跟他的神说过话。他说, 没有。年轻人是从来不会去那边的，只有那些被称作奥乌卡基的老人们才会去那边。我让他解释什么是奥乌卡基，他就说，那是他们部落里的祭司或僧侣。他们到那边说“哦”（他把这个称作他们的祈祷），然后再返回来告诉人们，贝纳木基神说了些什么。通过星期五的一番话，我注意到，即使是在世界上最盲目、最无知的异教徒中也有祭司制。此外，我还注意到，为了能让人们一直对神职人员保持敬仰之情，把宗教神秘化的这种做法不仅存在于罗马天主教中，很有可能存在于世界上所有的宗教中，甚至存在于最残忍、最野蛮的野人中。</td>
		<td class="en">From these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true God; I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing up towards heaven;that He governed the world by the same power and providence by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and could do everything for us, give everything to us, take everything from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes.He listened with great attention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us; and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and His being able to hear us, even in heaven.He told me one day, that if our God could hear us, up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to them.I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him.He said, No; they never went that were young men; none went thither but the old men, whom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made him explain to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say O (so he called saying prayers), and then came back and told them what Benamuckee said.By this I observed, that there is priestcraft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world; and the policy of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, not only to be found in the Roman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even among the most brutish and barbarous savages.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told him that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say O to their god Benamuckee was a cheat;and their bringing word from thence what he said was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or spake with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit;and then I entered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the origin of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin;how he had a secret access to our passions and to our affections, and to adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own choice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我发现，让他对魔鬼拥有一个正确的认识，做起来并没有像让他对上帝拥有一个正确的观念那么容易。我所有关于上帝的那些观点都可以通过自然现象来证明，证明上帝有必要作为最高主宰者，作为一种压倒一切、统治万物的力量，作为一种冥冥中的指引者而存在；也证明，向我们伟大的创造者致以敬意是完全合理和公正的等等。可是，看来似乎没有这类证据可以证明有关魔鬼的观念。魔鬼的起源，他的存在，他的本质，最重要的是，他一心作恶以及引诱人类去作恶的意图等。所以，一次，当这个可怜的家伙向我提出一个十分自然天真的问题时，我一下子懵了，简直不知道该对他说什么才好。因为之前，我给他讲了很多关于上帝的事情：上帝的权威，他的无所不能，他嫉恶如仇的本性，他用烈火烧死那些不义之徒的行为，还有，既然他能创造世界万物，那么他也能在一瞬间将我们全人类以及世间万物全部毁灭。每当我在讲这些的时候，他都一直是全神贯注地听着。在这之后，我又一直跟他讲，在世人的心目中，魔鬼是上帝的敌人，他使出全部的卑鄙伎俩，企图破坏上帝作出的善意安排，企图毁灭世界上的基督王国等等。“嗯，”星期五说道，“既然你说上帝很强大，很伟大，那么他是不是比魔鬼更强大、更有力量呢？”“是的，是的，”我回答道，“星期五，上帝比魔鬼更强大——上帝胜过魔鬼，所以我们要向上帝祈祷，请求获得力量把魔鬼踩在脚下，帮助我们抵制魔鬼的诱惑，扑灭他的火箭。”“但是，”他又说，“既然上帝比那邪恶的魔鬼更强大、更有力量，那为什么上帝不杀死魔鬼，别让他以后再做坏事了？”他这个问题让我感到非常吃惊，因为，不管怎么说，我现在虽然年龄很大了，但要做一个帮人驱除疑惑、解决困难的教师还是资历尚浅。对于他的问题，我一开始不知该怎么回答，所以，我只能装作没听见，就问他刚才说什么了。可是，星期五是真的想知道这一问题的答案，所以他根本不可能忘记他的问题，于是他又用同样结结巴巴的英语重复了一遍。到这时，我已经稍稍镇定了一些，我回答说：“上帝最终会严惩魔鬼的，魔鬼被留着，但他必定会受到审判，必定会被投进无底深渊，会经受烈火的炙烤，永世不得翻身。”星期五对这个答案显然不满意，他用我的话反问道：“‘最终还是留着！’我不明白——为什么不现在就杀死魔鬼呢？为什么不在很早以前就把魔鬼杀了呢？”“你这样问，还不如问我——”我回答道，“既然你和我在这里做了邪恶的事情，违背了上帝的意愿，那为什么上帝不把我们俩都杀了呢？上帝之所以留着我们，是想让我们有机会自我忏悔，有机会得到他的宽恕。”他对此沉思了好半天。“对呀，对呀，”他情绪激动地说道，“你、我、魔鬼都有罪，上帝把我们统统留下，是想让我们自己忏悔，上帝会宽恕我们所有人的。”他的这席话让我再一次羞愧万分。他让我意识到，虽然天赋的观念能够指引理性的人相信上帝，指引人们自然而然地对至高无上的上帝表示崇拜或尊敬，但是，除了上帝的神圣启示之外，再没有任何东西能够帮我们认识耶稣基督，认识到我们曾经得到过他的救赎，认识到他是我们与上帝缔结的新约的中间人，是上帝宝座前的仲裁者。要我说，只有上帝的神圣启示，才能在我们灵魂中形成这些认识。因此，只有我们的救世主耶稣基督的福音，只有上帝的圣言和上帝的圣灵，才能指引人类的道路，净化人类的心灵，才是人类认识上帝救人的道理以及拯救方法方面必不可少的引导者。</td>
		<td class="en">I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about the devil as it was about the being of a God.Nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause, an overruling, governing Power, a secret directing Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and the like;but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit, of his origin, his being, his nature, and above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him.I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion to sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as He had made us all, He could destroy us and all the world in a moment; and he listened with great seriousness to me all the while.After this I had been telling him how the devil was God’s enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like.“Well,” says Friday, “but you say God is so strong, so great; is He not much strong, much may as the devil?”“Yes, yes,” said I, “Friday; God is stronger than the devil—God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations and quench his fiery darts.”“But,” says he again, “if God much stronger, much might as the wicked devil, why God no kill the devil, so make him no more do wicked?”I was strangely surprised at this question; and, after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill qualified for a casuist or a solver of difficulties;and at first I could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he said; but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken words as above.By this time I had recovered myself a little and I said, “God will at last punish him severely; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire.”This did not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon me, repeating my words, “‘RESERVE AT LAST!’me no understand—but why not kill the devil now; not kill great ago?”“You may as well ask me,” said I, “why God does not kill you or me, when we do wicked things here that offend Him—we are preserved to repent and be pardoned.”He mused some time on this.“Well, well,” says he, mighty affectionately, “that well—so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.”Here I was run down again by him to the last degree; and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God,and of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us;of a Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of God’s throne;I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven can form these in the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God and the means of salvation.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在岛上的最后几年里，我都一直是抱着这种感恩的心情来度过的。我和星期五在岛上共同生活了三年。在这三年里，我们经常说话聊天，日子过得相当美满幸福。如果说尘世中真有美满幸福的生活，那我们的生活就属于这种状态。这个野人现在已经成为一名虔诚的基督徒，甚至比我还要虔诚。尽管如此，我有理由希望，希望我们两个都能成为同样悔罪的人，能从悔罪中得到安慰，得以改过自新，同时，我为自己的这个希望感谢上帝。我们在这里可以读《圣经》，所以我们与圣灵也不会离得太远，也能听到他的教导，就像是在英国那样。在阅读《圣经》的过程中，我总是尽可能地帮助星期五去理解我所读诗句的意思。而他呢，也认真钻研，主动提问，这让我对《圣经》的理解比我过去独自一个人阅读时所得到的理解要深刻得多，这一点我在前面已经提过。还有一件事，我也不得不在这里提一下。我在荒岛上的这段隐居生活的经历让我有了一些体会，那就是，人类其实拥有一种无限的、难以言表的幸福，因为，《圣经》中清清楚楚地记载了对上帝的认识以及耶稣基督拯救人类的教义，这样很容易被人接受和理解。仅仅只读《圣经》这一本书，就能让我完全意识到自己肩负的责任，并直接引领我勇敢担负起这项重大的任务，虔诚地为自己所犯的罪进行忏悔，依靠救世主来拯救自己，同时也引领我在实践中实现自我完善，服从上帝的所有指示。而所有这些道理，都是我在没有任何老师或指导者的情况下自己领悟出来的，我的意思是没有人指导我。于是，同样浅显易懂的教导也足以启迪这个可怜的野人，让他成为我生平中所认识的为数不多的极其虔诚的基督徒之一。</td>
		<td class="en">I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time; and the conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was such as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be formed in a sublunary state.This savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents.We had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from His Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.I always applied myself, in reading the Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than I should ever have been by my own mere private reading.Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here also, from experience in this retired part of my life, viz. how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of God, so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Salviour for life and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to all God’s commands, and this without any teacher or instructor, I mean human;so the same plain instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known few equal to him in my life.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我给他描述了一下欧洲的情况，尤其是我的故乡英国的情况，并告诉他我们怎样生活，怎样敬拜上帝，怎样彼此相处，怎样乘船去世界各地做买卖。我又给他讲了我们乘坐的船出事的经过，并到海边指给他看沉船的大致位置。此时，它早已被海浪击成碎片，不复存在了。然后，我又把我们逃命时翻掉的那只救生艇的残骸指给他看。当时，我曾经使劲全力想把它推下水，可怎么推也推不动，现在，它也几乎快烂成碎片了。看到这条小艇，星期五呆住了，沉思了好久，一言不发。我就问他，他在思考什么呢。最后他说：“我见过这样的小船到过我们部落那里。”我半天没弄明白他是什么意思。不过最后，在我进一步详细追问之后，我终于明白了，原来，有一条和这一模一样的小艇，曾在他们住的地方靠岸。他解释说，那只小艇是被狂风大浪冲到那里的。我立刻联想到，那肯定是只欧洲的商船在他们的海岸附近出事了，小艇被风浪吹离大船，漂到海岸边。但是，我当时反应真的很愚钝，竟然没想到船上的人也许是从失事的船上乘坐小艇逃生，逃到他们那边去了，更没有想过那些人到底从何而来。于是，我只是向星期五打听，那只小艇具体是个什么样子。</td>
		<td class="en">I described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world.I gave him an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone.I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength then; but was now fallen almost all to pieces.Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood, musing a great while, and said nothing.I asked him what it was he studied upon.At last says he, “Me see such boat like come to place at my nation.”I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had examined further into it, I understood by him that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived: that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather.I presently imagined that some European ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of men making their escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might come: so I only inquired after a description of the boat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >星期五十分详尽地向我描述了那只小艇，之后，他略显激动地补充说：“我们还从水中救出一些白人。”我这才更好地理解了他的意思。我赶紧问他，小艇上是否有他所谓的白人。“有的，”他说，“整个船上全都是白人。”我问他总共有多少人。他扳着指头数，告诉我有十七个。我又追问他，他们后来怎样了。他告诉我：“他们都还活着，就住在我们的部落里。”</td>
		<td class="en">Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to understand him when he added with some warmth, “We save the white mans from drown.”Then I presently asked if there were any white mans, as he called them, in the boat.“Yes,” he said; “the boat full of white mans.”I asked him how many.He told upon his fingers seventeen.I asked him then what became of them.He told me, “They live, they dwell at my nation.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这又使我产生了新的想法。我马上联想到，这些白人也许就是我上次从岛上看到出事的那艘船上的船员，他们在船触礁之后，知道船早晚会沉没的，便乘坐小艇逃生了，之后就在那块野人聚居的蛮荒之地的海岸边上了岸。于是，我便向星期五更详细地打听那些白人现在的下落。他十分肯定地告诉我，那些人现在仍住在那里。他们在那里已经住了大约四年了。野人们与他们各自生活，相安无事，还给他们粮食吃。我问他，他们怎么没有把那些白人杀掉吃了呢。他说：“不，他们和白人结成兄弟了。”我对此的理解是，他们之间达成了某种休战协议，然后，他又补充说：“他们除了在打仗时吃人，平时并不吃人。”也就是说，他们平时一般是不吃人的，只有在交战中才吃那些被抓获的俘虏。</td>
		<td class="en">This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now called it; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages.Upon this I inquired of him more critically what was become of them.He assured me they lived still there; that they had been there about four years; that the savages left them alone, and gave them victuals to live on.I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them.He said,“No,they make brother with them;” that is, as I understood him, a truce;” and then he added,“They no eat mans but when make the war fight;” that is to say, they never eat any men but such as come to fight with them and are taken in battle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这之后过了很长一段时间，我和星期五，在一个晴空万里的日子里，爬上了岛东边那座小山的山顶。我之前曾经说过，就是在这个山顶上，那天天气晴朗，我曾看到了美洲大陆。当时，星期五全神贯注地眺望着对面的大陆，突然他惊奇地开始手舞足蹈地跳起来，还朝我大声叫喊着，当时我站在离他稍远的地方。我问他出什么事了。“噢，我很高兴！”他说，“噢，我很开心！我看见我的家乡在那边，看见我的部落在那边！”我看到，他的脸上显现出一种格外欣喜的表情，两眼闪闪发光，流露出异常向往的神色，就好像他想立刻返回自己的家乡似的。看到他这样，我不由胡思乱想起来，我开始感觉他像是变了一个人，也不能像以前那样与他融洽相处了。我丝毫不怀疑，如果星期五能够返回他自己的部落，他不仅会忘记他现在所有的宗教信仰，而且会忘记他对我的所有义务。他会非常莽撞地告知他的同胞有关我的一切，然后还可能会带上一二百人回到岛上来，把我胡吃海塞地吃掉。到那时，他可能会像过去吃那些被抓获的战俘那样，兴高采烈地把我吃掉。可是，我这些想法实在是大大冤枉了这个老实巴交的可怜人，后来我还为此深表歉意。不过，当时我的猜忌之心是有增无减，并一连持续了好几个星期。我变得越来越谨慎，对待他也不像以前那样亲密和善了。我当时的这种做法无疑也是大错特错的。星期五仍一如既往地对我真诚相待，心怀感激，正如后来的事实所表明的，他的思想符合那些最高尚的信条，丝毫没想过我想的那些事情。他不但是个虔诚的基督徒，还是个知恩图报的朋友，他这些良好的人品让我对他感到相当满意。</td>
		<td class="en">It was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of the hill at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent of America, Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the mainland,and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some distance from him.I asked him what the matter was.“Oh, joy!”says he; “Oh, glad!There see my country, there my nation!”I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country again.This observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his own nation again,he would not only forget all his religion but all his obligation to me, and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies when they were taken in war.But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very sorry afterwards.However, as my jealousy increased, and held some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before: in which I was certainly wrong too; the honest, grateful creature having no thought about it but what consisted with the best principles, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我承认，从这时起，我就有了冒险漂洋过海的想法，想看看能不能和那些长有胡须的白人联系上。那些白人，毫无疑问，不是西班牙人，就是葡萄牙人。同时，我也毫不怀疑，如果我能与他们取得联系，那我们就一定能找到从那里逃走的办法。因为，一方面，我们在大陆上，另一方面，我们许多人结伴而行，这总比我独自一人，孤立无援，从远离大陆四十海里的荒岛上逃出去要容易得多。于是，几天后，我又带着星期五一起外出干活。谈话中，我告诉他，我打算送给他一条船，让他回到自己的部落中去，所以，我就把他带到岛的另一端我藏船的那个地方。到了那里，我先把船里的水清空（我之前一直是把船沉在水底下的），让船浮起来，展示给他看，接着，我们俩都上了船。我发现，他对驾船十分娴熟，而且几乎能把船划得和我一样快。所以，在船上时，我就对他说：“好了，星期五，现在我们可以到你的部落那边去了吧？”听到我说这话，他呆呆地看着我，好像是因为他觉得这船太小了，根本走不了那么远。于是，我告诉他，我还有条比这更大一点的船。然后，第二天，我就带他来到另一个地方，那里存放着我造的第一条船，但这只船我没法让它下水。他说，船是足够大的，不过，那时，由于我一直没好好保管它，再加上它在那里躺了有二十二三年了，经过长年的日晒，船已经干裂腐烂了。星期五告诉我，这样的船就很好，可以装“足够的食物、喝的、面包”，这就是他说话的方式。</td>

		<td class="en">Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over with him to the continent that I told him we would go and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it.He answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad.I asked him what the matter with him was.I asked him what he meant.I told him I was not angry with him at all.“No angry!” says he, repeating the words several times; “why send Friday home away to my nation?”“Why,” said I, “Friday, did not you say you wished you were there?”“Yes, yes,” says he, “wish we both there; no wish Friday there, no master there.”In a word, he would not think of going there without me.“I go there, Friday?”said I; “what shall I do there?”He turned very quick upon me at this.“You do great deal much good,” says he; “you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new life.”“Alas, Friday!” said I,“thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself.”“Yes, yes,” says he, “you teachee me good, you teachee them good.”“No, no, Friday,” said I, “you shall go without me; leave me here to live by myself, as I did before.”He looked confused again at that word; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me.“What must I do with this?” said I to him.“You take kill Friday,” says he.“What must kill you for?” said I again.He returns very quickly—“What you send Friday away for?Take kill Friday, no send Friday away.”This he spoke so earnestly that I saw tears stand in his eyes.In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then and often after, that I would never send him away from me if he was willing to stay with me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >总之，通过与他的所有谈话，我发现，他对我的感情是坚定不移的，没有任何东西能把他从我身边带走，而且，我还发现，他之所以渴望回到自己的家乡，完全是出于对自己部落那份炽热的爱，同时也希望我能给他们带来一些好处。不过，关于这一点，我丝毫没把握，所以我一点都不想、不愿、也不希望为此去对面的大陆。不过，从之前与星期五的谈话中，我得知：大陆那边有十七个长有胡须的人。正是基于这一点，我内心才出现一种非常强烈的愿望，希望自己能从这荒岛上逃走。因此，我马上与星期五开始行动，去找一棵适合砍伐的大树，造一条大的独木舟，准备这次航行。在这个岛上，树木到处都是，足以打造一支小型舰队，而且，不仅可以打造一支独木舟的舰队，甚至可以打造一支大船的舰队。不过，我的主要目的是尽可能找到一棵靠近水边的树。这样，独木舟造好以后就可以下水了，不至于再犯上次的错误。最后，星期五选定了一棵树。我发现，对于什么样的木料最适合造船，他比我知道的要多得多。而且，直到今天，我也不知道我们当时砍倒的那棵树是什么树，只知道它长得很像我们所说的黄木，或者是介于黄木和尼加拉瓜木之间的那种树，因为它与这两种树有着相同的颜色和气味。星期五原打算用火把这棵树的中间烧空，然后用它来造一条船，但我给他展示了如何用工具把树凿空。在我展示完工具的使用方法后，他就干得非常得心应手了。经过大概一个月的辛苦劳作，我们终于把船造好了，而且外观做得非常漂亮，尤其是在我教会他如何用斧头以后，我们就用斧头把树的外壳砍削得宛如一艘正规的船。不过，船造好后，我们还花了将近两周的时间，用大的滚杆将它一点一点地推下水。当它下水后，我们发现它足以轻松搭载二十个人。</td>
		<td class="en">Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to me, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought or intention, or desire of undertaking it.But still I found a strong inclination to attempting my escape, founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen bearded men there; and therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage.There were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good, large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first.At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell.Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools; which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily;and in about a month’s hard labour we finished it and made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat.After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight’s time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men with great ease.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >船下水后，虽然很大，但我惊讶地看到，我的仆人星期五驾起船来挥桨如飞，回旋自如，动作极其灵巧和迅速。于是我问他，他要不要去对岸，我们能不能坐这条船过去。“是的，”他说，“我们可以非常安全地乘它过海，即使遇上大风也不要紧。”不过，我还有一些不为他所知的进一步的想法，那就是，我要做一根桅杆、一张船帆，此外还要给船配上船锚和缆绳。至于桅杆，那是很容易弄到的。我在附近找到一株笔直的小雪松，这个岛上有很多这样的树，我让星期五把它砍倒，并教会他如何把它削成桅杆的样子。可是，船帆的事情却让我大伤脑筋。我知道我有足够的旧船帆，准确地说，是足够的旧帆布片，但这些东西已被我搁置了二十六年，再加上我从来没想到它们将来会派上用场，所以也没细心保管它们。因此，我相信它们到现在肯定全都烂掉了，事实上，大部分也确实已经腐烂了。不过，我还是从中找到了两块看起来还相当不错的帆布片。之后，我便开始用这些材料缝制船帆。你知道，因为没有针，我缝起来很吃力，动作也很笨拙。最后，我总算是做好了一块三角形的东西，样子十分丑陋，像我们英国的三角帆。我还在帆的底部装上了一根横木，在顶部装一根短的斜撑帆杆，就像我们大船的救生艇上的帆一样。对于这种帆的操作，我可是相当得心应手，因为我之前从巴巴里逃出来时乘坐的那艘大船上，装的就是这种帆，关于这件事，我已经在本书的第一部分讲过了。</td>
		<td class="en">When she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn her, and paddle her along.So I asked him if he would, and if we might venture over in her.“Yes,” he said, “we venture over in her very well, though great blow wind.”However I had a further design that he knew nothing of, and that was, to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable.As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which there were great plenty of in the island, and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and order it.But as to the sail, that was my particular care.I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them now six and twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten; and, indeed, most of them were so.However, I found two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work;and with a great deal of pains, and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder of mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually our ships’ longboats sail with, and such as I best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I had to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part of my story.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我花了将近两个月的时间，进行这最后一项工作，即装备桅杆和船帆，因为我把这项工作做得尽善尽美。我还做了一根小桅索和一张前桅帆，以帮助我逆风时行船。此外，最为重要的是，我还在船尾装了一个舵，便于我掌握船的方向。我只是个笨拙的造船工，不过，因为知道这项工作的有用性和必要性，所以我不辞劳苦，尽全力去做，直至最终把它完成。在这期间，我许多愚蠢的设计都以失败而告终，如果把这些都算在内，我想我在这件事上耗费的精力和造这小船所花的精力几乎一样多。</td>
		<td class="en">I was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging and fitting my masts and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist if we should turn to windward; and, what was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with.I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >待所有这一切都装备完毕，我就开始教星期五如何使用这些工具来航海。他虽然划桨划得很好，但对于如何使用帆和舵，却是一无所知。当他看到我手中掌舵，驾着小船在海面上自由穿梭，船帆里面灌满了风，随着行驶线路的变化而忽左忽右时，他简直惊得目瞪口呆。我的意思是，当他看到这种情形后，便呆呆站在那里，就像个受了惊吓的人似的。不过，在我对他稍加指点之后，他很快掌握了舵和帆的使用方法，成为了一名很出色的水手。只是，对于罗盘的使用，不管我怎么解释，他还是不能明白。从另一方面讲，因为这一带很少或者说几乎没有云雾天气，夜晚总能看到星辰，白天也总是能看到海岸，所以，除了雨季很少有机需要使用罗盘，不过雨季人们都不愿出门，别说是出海航行，就是在岛上走走也很少了。</td>
		<td class="en">After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; though he knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder;and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled this way or that way as the course we sailed changed; I say when he saw this he stood like one astonished and amazed.However, with a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except that of the compass I could make him understand very little.On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by land or sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到现在为止，我已经被困在这个荒岛上整整二十七年了，虽说最后这三年，似乎不应该计算在内，因为，自从有了星期五这个伴，我的生活便和以前截然不同了。不过，我仍和刚开始一样，怀着对仁慈的上帝的感激之心，度过了上岛的纪念日。如果过去我有充分的理由感谢上帝的话，那么现在就更加如此了，因为我现在有更多的证据可以证明，上帝对我还是非常关爱的。同时，他还给了我极大的希望，让我知道自己最终会得到真正的拯救，很快就能脱离苦海；我内心深处有种不可战胜的感觉：我脱离苦海之日已近在咫尺，我在这里的日子最多不会再超过一年。尽管如此，我还是一如既往地继续耕作：挖土、种植、圈篱笆。我还是像往常一样，采摘葡萄，晒葡萄干，做所有的日常工作。同时，雨季即将来临，那时我大部分时间都是呆在家里的。我们还把新造的船藏到了一个尽可能安全的地方，把船移到了我起初提过的卸载木木筏的那个小湾里。并趁着涨潮的时候，把船拖上了岸。我还叫我的仆人星期五挖了一个小船坞，大小刚好能容纳这只船，深浅刚好能让船在注水后的船坞里浮起来。之后，等退潮的时候，我们还在船坞口处筑起了一道坚固的坝，防止海水进入。这样一来，即使潮水上涨，船也不会被淹到。此外，为防止船被雨淋湿，我们还在船上面放了很多的树枝，把它遮盖得严严实实，看起来就像个茅草屋的屋顶。就这样，我们等候着十一月和十二月的到来，我打算在这个时候冒险出航。</td>
		<td class="en">I was now entered on the seven and twentieth year of my captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of the time.I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God for His mercies as at first: and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered;for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another year in this place.I went on, however, with my husbandry; digging, planting, and fencing as usual.I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing as before.The rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept more within doors than at other times.We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the shore at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to float in;and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay, dry as to the tide from the sea:and to keep the rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the months of November and December, in which I designed to make my adventure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，随着旱季的到来，天气逐渐好转，我心里又开始想着之前的冒险计划，每天都在忙着为这次航行做准备。我要做的第一件事就是储备足够的粮食，以供航行之用。我打算在一两周之内，打开船坞，把我们的船推下水。一天早上，我正忙着出航之类的事情，那时，我让星期五去海边，看看能不能抓只海龟回来。我们通常每周总会抓一只回来，吃它的蛋和肉。星期五没走多远，忽然就跑回来，他跑的速度非常快，一下子就越过了我的外墙，或者说是篱笆，好像双脚根本没着地似的。我还没来得及跟他说话，他便向我大叫起来：“噢，主人！噢，主人！噢，不好了！噢，坏了！”“发生什么事了，星期五？”我问道。“噢，在那边，”他说，“有一只、两只、三只独木舟；一只、两只、三只！”听他这么说，我刚开始以为那里总共有六只独木舟呢；不过细问之后，我发现只有三只。“好了，星期五，”我说，“别害怕。”我尽量给他打气。不过，我发现这个可怜的家伙简直吓坏了，因为他脑海里没别的想法，只想到他们是来找他的，要把他切成碎块吃掉。于是，这可怜的家伙吓得浑身发抖，我都不知道该拿他怎么办才好。我尽量安慰他，告诉他我也和他一样处于危险中，他们也会把我吃掉。“不过，”我说，“星期五，我们必须下决心和他们打仗。你能打仗吗，星期五？”“我会开枪，”他说，“不过，他们来了好多人呀。”“那没关系，”我又说，“我们的枪会吓跑他们的，根本不用我们去杀他们。”于是我问他，如果我决心保护他，他会不会保护我，和我并肩作战，听从我的指挥。他说：“就算你让我去死，我也愿意，主人。”于是我进去拿了满满一大杯朗姆酒，让他喝下去，因为我喝朗姆酒一向很节俭，所以还剩下很多。我们都喝了酒之后，我叫他拿上我们平时一直带在身上的那两支猎枪，并给它们装上大号子弹，大小和小型手枪的子弹差不多。然后，我自己也拿了四支火枪，各装上两颗弹丸和五颗小子弹，还带了两支手枪，每支装上两颗子弹。我像往常一样，在腰间挂上那把无鞘的大刀，并把那柄斧头给了星期五。一切准备就绪后，我拿起望远镜，跑到山坡上去观察一下情况。借着望远镜，我很快就发现，那里总共有二十一个野人，三个俘虏，以及三只独木舟。看起来，他们此行的目的，就是准备用这三个俘虏的身体来举行一场人肉庆功宴，这真是一场野蛮的宴会呀！但是，正如我之前所观察到的，这对他们来说是家常便饭。此外，我还观察到，这次他们上岸的地点，并不是上次星期五逃走的那边，而是更靠近我小湾的这边，这一带海岸较低，还有一片茂密的树林几乎快延伸到海边。一想到这些野人在此登陆的目的就是要干那些毫无人性的勾当，我就感到万分憎恶，怒不可遏。我立刻跑下山，来到星期五身边，告诉他，我决定要过那边去把那些人杀个精光，问他愿不愿意和我一起并肩作战。现在他已经不再害怕了，再加上我给他喝了点酒，他的精神也振奋了些。听到我的话，他感到非常高兴，像以前那样对我说，就算我让他死，他也愿意。</td>
		<td class="en">When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage.And the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and intended in a week or a fortnight’s time to open the dock, and launch out our boat.I was busy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him to go to the seashore and see if he could find a turtle or a tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh.Friday had not been long gone when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground or the steps he set his foot on; and before I had time to speak to him he cries out to me, “O master! O master! O sorrow! O bad!”—“What’s the matter, Friday?” said I.“O yonder there,” says he, “one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!”By this way of speaking I concluded there were six; but on inquiry I found there were but three.“Well, Friday,” said I, “do not be frightened.”So I heartened him up as well as I could.However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him.I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him.“But,” said I, “Friday, we must resolve to fight them.Can you fight, Friday?”“Me shoot,” says he, “but there come many great number.”“No matter for that,” said I again; “our guns will fright them that we do not kill.”So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him.He said, “Me die when you bid die, master.”So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I had been so good a husband of my rum that I had a great deal left.When we had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol bullets.Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each.I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could discover; and I found quickly by my glass that there were one and twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies: a barbarous feast, indeed!But nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual with them.I observed also that they had landed, not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea.This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation that I came down again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to them and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by me.He had now got over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >盛怒之下，我把此前装好弹药的武器分成两份，就像过去做的那样。我交给星期五一支手枪，让他插在腰带上，还交给他三支长枪，让他背在肩上。我自己也拿了一支手枪和其他三支长枪。我们就这样全副武装地出发了。我拿了一小瓶朗姆酒放在衣袋里，并交给星期五一个装有火药和子弹的大口袋，之后，我吩咐他要紧跟在我身后，没我的命令，不要轻举妄动，不准随便开枪，不得擅自行事，同时，不许讲话。就这样，我向右手边的方向绕了差不多有一英里，越过那个小湾，钻进树林。这样的话，我便可以在被他们发现之前，将他们纳入我子弹的射程之内，而之前我用望远镜观察过，这件事很容易办到。</td>
		<td class="en">In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before, between us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns myself; and in this posture we marched out.I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the meantime not to speak a word.In this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come within shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在前进的过程中，我之前曾有过的一些想法现在又回来了，我的决心开始有些动摇。我并不是指我对这么多野人感到害怕，因为他们这些野人个个赤身裸体，没有任何武器，在这点上我绝对是比他们有优势的，尽管我只有自己一个人，但那也没问题的。但是，我想到的是，我到底有什么使命，什么理由，更不要说有什么必要去杀人，让自己的双手沾满鲜血，去攻击那些既没有伤害过我，也无意伤害我的人？对于我来说，他们是无辜的，他们野蛮的风俗只是他们自己的灾难。事实上，他们本身就是一个象征，表明上帝是有意把他们，以及世界上那一带的其他民族遗留在那么愚昧无知、残忍野蛮的状态。但是上帝并没有召唤我，让我去做他们行为的评判者，更没有要我去做实现他正义律法的执行者——不管在什么时候，只要上帝觉得合适，他都会亲自执法，对他们全民族所犯的罪行进行全民族性的惩罚。但是，即使是这样，这一切也与我无关；当然，要是星期五这样做的话，他倒是有正当理由的，因为他与上岸的这群人是公开的敌人，处于交战状态，所以如果他去攻击他们，那也是合法的。但是，我本人的情况和他不同。我往前走着，一路上，这些想法一直萦绕在我脑海里。我最终决定，先走到那边，站在他们附近，观察一下他们野蛮的宴会，等到上帝下达指示之后，我再行动。但是，除非是有什么事给我一个强烈的召唤，否则，我是绝对不会干涉他们的。</td>
		<td class="en">While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their number, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them—nay, though I had been alone.But it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done or intended me any wrong?Who, as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God’s having left them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner of His justice—that whenever He thought fit He would take the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance punish them as a people for national crimes, but that, in the meantime, it was none of my business—that it was true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy and in a state of war with those very particular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them—but I could not say the same with regard to myself.These things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself near them that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless something offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king I looked.First of all, the whole country was my own property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion.Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected—I was absolutely lord and lawgiver—they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me.It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three different religions—my man Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist.However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my dominions.But this is by the way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我把这两个刚刚营救出来的、身体非常虚弱的俘虏妥善安置好，让他们有个挡风遮雨和休息的地方。然后，我就马上开始考虑为他们做点吃的东西。我做的第一件事，就是吩咐星期五从我那个专门的羊圈里挑选一只年龄介于羊羔和山羊之间的一岁大的山羊拉出来宰了。然后，我砍下羊的后半截，剁成碎块，叫星期五拿到火上去又煮又炖，烹制出一道美味可口的羊肉汤大餐。我向你保证，那绝对是一道美味大餐。这顿饭是在户外做的，因为我从来不在内墙里生火。做好后，我就端进新帐篷里，并在那里给他们支了张桌子，然后坐下来和他们共同用餐，席间，我尽量鼓励他们。星期五这时则充当我的翻译，主要为他的父亲翻译，不过，有时也为那个西班牙人翻译，因为西班牙人说野人的语言说得也很好。</td>
		<td class="en">As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some provision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed;when I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth;and as I cooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged them.Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吃完饭后，准确地说，是喝完汤后，我便吩咐星期五驾一只独木舟，去取回我们的火枪和其他枪支。那些武器，由于当时时间比较仓促，就留在战场上了。第二天，我命令星期五去那边把那些野人的尸体全都埋掉。因为，如果把尸体曝晒于太阳底下，很快就会发臭的。我还命令他把那些野人在那场野蛮的人肉宴上所遗留下来的可怕的尸骨全都埋掉，这件事我实在是不想亲自去做，不要说埋，就是路过那里看一眼我也受不了。所有这一切，星期五都按时完成了，把那些野人遗留在那里的痕迹全都清除干净了。因此，我再去那里的时候，要不是凭借那片树林的一角辨别方向，几乎快认不出那地方了。</td>
		<td class="en">After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would presently be offensive.I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them if I went that way;all which he punctually performed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，我和我那两个新来的臣民作了次简短的谈话。我先让星期五问问他父亲，看他对那几个坐船逃走的野人是怎么想的，他们会不会带大批的野人卷土重来，人数多得我们可能难以抵抗。他父亲的第一反应是，那些坐船逃走的野人肯定逃不过那晚的暴风，他们肯定会被淹死，或者被刮到南边别的海岸上去。要真是这样的话，他们肯定会被当地的野人吃掉的。而如果他们的船失事了，他们也肯定会被海水淹死的。可是，至于说他们如果安全上了岸会采取什么举措，星期五的父亲说他就不知道了。不过，他的看法是，他们遭到这样的突然袭击，听到枪响，看到枪冒出的火光，肯定已被吓得魂飞魄散了。所以，他相信，那些野人回去后，肯定会对部落里的人说，其他人是被雷电，而不是被人杀死的，而至于出现在他们面前的那俩人——就是我和星期五——他们肯定以为是从天上派下来消灭他们的天神或者复仇之神，而不是携带武器的人类。他还说，他之所以知道这些是因为他听到所有那些野人都是这么喊的。他们用他们自己部落的语言把这个意思传来传去。因为，对于他们来说，根本无法想象，有人连手都不用抬一下，就能喷火放雷，就像我们现在做的那样。这位年迈的野人说得一点儿没错。因为，正如我了解到的，后来的事实也证明，那些野人自此以后再也不敢来这座岛了。他们听了那四个人的描述后感到非常恐惧（看来那四个人居然逃过风浪了），所以他们认为，谁要是去那座魔岛，就一定会被天神用雷电杀死。不过，我起初并不知道这些。因此，有很长一段时间我一直都很担心，每天会带上我的全部军队严加防守。我们现在总共有四个人了，所以只要是在这片开阔的土地上，即使他们来上一百人，我也敢冒险和他们干上一仗。</td>
		<td class="en">I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist.His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night they went off, but must of necessity be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away;but, as to what they would do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared—viz. Friday and I—were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons.This, he said, he knew; because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to another; for it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now: and this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood since, by other hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from the gods.This, however, I knew not; and therefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were now four of us, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但过了一会儿，野人的独木舟并没有出现，我对于他们到来的担心也就渐渐消失了，继而又重新开始考虑坐船去大陆的问题。因为星期五的父亲同样向我保证，如果我去的话，他们的族人可能会看在他的面子上好好接待我。但是,在我跟那个西班牙人进行了认真交谈、得知他们那里还有十六个西班牙人和葡萄牙人后，就暂且把这个念头放到了一边。那些人都是因为船只失事而逃到那边的。他们的确和野人能和平相处，但他们在生活必需品上极度匮乏，简直无法维持生活。我问了西班牙人他们的详细航程，得知他们是搭乘一条西班牙船，从拉普拉塔河出发去哈瓦那卸货的，货物主要是兽皮和银子，然后再顺便看看有没有什么欧洲货可以运回去。船上有五个从另一条失事船只上被救下的葡萄牙水手。本来还有五个他们自己的西班牙船员，但后来在一次船只事故中被淹死了。其他的人历尽千难万险，在就快饿死的时候逃到了那个食人族聚集的海岸。在那里，他们得时时刻刻提心吊胆，生怕被那些人吃掉。他还告诉我，上岸的时候他们还有些武器，但实在是没有用——因为既没火药，又没弹丸。他们的弹药都被海水浸湿了，而仅剩的一点儿也在刚上岸打猎充饥时全用光了。我问他，他认为那些人的命运会怎样，还有他们是否计划过逃跑。他说他们也商量过很多次逃跑的事，但是没有船，也没法弄到造船的工具，并且什么粮食都没有，所以商量到最后，总是以泪水和绝望告终。我又问他，他们是否会接受我提出的逃生建议。还有，如果他们全都来我这个岛上的话，逃生有没有可能实现。我坦率地告诉他：我最担心的是在我把自己的性命交到他们手里后，他们就会背叛我、对我不利。因为感恩并非人人天生的美德，而且人们往往依据他们所期望的利益来行事，而非让自己的行为同要履行的义务保持一致。我告诉他，如果他们利用我成功逃离后，把我当作俘虏押送到新西班牙去，那事情就非常难办了。因为作为一个英国人，不论你是必须还是意外去到那里，都必定会受到宗教迫害。如果这样，我宁可被送到那些野人那里被活活吃掉，也不要落到那些西班牙神父无情的掌心中，然后受宗教法庭的审判。我补充说，如果他们使我信服，我相信如果他们都到岛上来，我们或许可以团结一致，携手造一条能把我们全部带走的大船，向南开去巴西，或者向北开去西印度群岛或西班牙海岸。但是，如果他们恩将仇报，在我把武器交给他们后，就用武力把我劫持到西班牙人那里去，那就枉费我一番好心，让我落入比之前更糟糕的处境。听完我的话，西班牙人十分正直而坦率地回答说：现在他们的处境非常悲惨，他们已经受够了，他相信他们绝不可能不近人情地背叛帮助他们逃离险境的人。他还说，如果我乐意的话，他可以跟老黑人一起去见他们，跟他们商量一下这件事，再回来给我答复。他说他会跟他们讲好条件，让他们郑重发誓会完全服从我的命令，就像我是他们的司令和船长一样。另外，他们得以圣礼和《福音书》的名义起誓会绝对效忠于我，如果我让他们去这个基督教国家，他们绝不会去那一个。他们会绝对彻底地服从于我，直到在我所指定的地点安全登陆。为此，他会让他们亲手签下盟书，再带回来给我。然后他说：他会首先对我发誓，除非有我的命令，否则只要他活着就永远不会离开我；如果他的同胞中当真发生了丝毫背信弃义的事，他会站在我这边，直到流尽最后一滴血。他说他们都是十分文明而诚实的人，现在正经受着可以想象的最大的苦难。他们没有武器，没有衣服，也没有粮食，命运完全由野人掌控；他们已经对重返故乡几近绝望。因此，他确信，如果我愿意帮他们脱离困境，他们一定与我同生共死。见他如此保证，我决定尽可能冒险救出他们。我想先派那位老野人和这个西班牙人去跟他们谈谈。但当我们把一切准备好之后，那个西班牙人自己突然提出反对意见。他的说辞谨慎且真诚，让我非常满意；于是也就听了他的话，把拯救他同胞的计划推迟了至少半年。情况是这样的：这个西班牙人到现在为止跟我们在一起生活了大概一个月了。在这段时间里，我让他看到了在上帝的保佑下，我是如何维持生活的。同时他也清楚地看到了我小麦和大米的储备量，这么多粮食我一个人吃当然绰绰有余，但如果没有妥善节约打理，就不够现在增至到的一家四张嘴吃了。那么，要是再加上他的同胞，就更是远远不够。据他说，现在还有十六个人活着，将会全部过来。尤其是，如果我们还要造船，航行到美洲的某个基督教国家的殖民地，这点粮食完全不够养活一船的人。所以那个西班牙人跟我说，他觉得如果我能尽量省下一些种子的话，最好让他和星期五父子再开垦一些土地。这样等到收获之时，他们过来的时候，我们就能有足够的粮食给他的同胞。因为如果生活必需品不足，他们也许会拒绝来，或者认为自己未被解救，只不过是从一个困境跳到了另一个困境。“你知道的，”他说，“那些以色列的后裔，当他们刚被救出埃及的时候，也觉得非常开心，但当他们在荒野中寻觅面包时，甚至反抗了救出他们的上帝。”他谨小慎微的考虑完全合乎情理，因此我想都没想就愉快地接受了他的提议，同时对他的忠诚也非常满意。于是，我们四个人就用现有条件下的木制工具开始开垦。大概过了一个月左右，我们开垦了一大片土地，赶在播种季节之前，将其整理妥当。然后我们种了大概二十二蒲式耳大麦和十六罐大米。简单地说，这就是我们能省下来的全部种子了。现在，我们已经有了足够的朋友，数量多到就算野人们来了，我们也不害怕，除非他们的数量非常庞大。我们抓住每个机会在岛上自由来往。因为我们脑子里装了逃跑和脱险的事，至少对我来说，我不可能不去想逃脱的办法。为此，我标记了几棵我觉得适合造船的树，让星期五父子把它们砍倒。然后，我告诉了西班牙人我关于那件事的想法，让他去监督和指挥星期五父子工作。我向他们示范了我是怎样不辞辛劳地把一棵大树削成单片木板的，并让他们照着做。就这样，他们用优良的橡树做了十二块大木板，每块大概将近两尺宽，三十五尺长，二到四尺厚。可想而知这得花大功夫。同时，我设法尽可能壮大驯服的小山羊群。为此，我让星期五和西班牙人第一天出去，我和星期五的父亲第二天出去（如此轮流），用这种方法我们找到了大约二十只小山羊，和其余的羊一起饲养。因为每当我们射中母羊时，我们就会留下小羊，让它们加入我们的羊群中来。但是，更重要的是，当葡萄晒制季节到来时，我让大家采集了大量的葡萄，挂在太阳下。如果我们是在以生产葡萄干著称的阿利坎特的话，我相信我们这次制作的葡萄干可以装满六十到八十大桶。这些葡萄干和面包一起，成了我们生活的主要食物——还非常补身体，我肯定，因为它们特别有营养。现在该丰收了，我们的庄稼长得不错。尽管不是我在岛上见到的增收最丰的一次，但也足够应付我们的需求了。因为我们种的二十二蒲式耳大麦，收获时足足翻了十倍；稻米收成的比例也差不多。这样一来，即使那十六个西班牙人全都过来，这些粮食也足够我们所有的人吃到下一个收获季节了。如果我们要航海的话，在船上也可以储存足够的粮食，足以供应我们去世界的任何地方——我是说，去美洲的任何地方。当我们把粮食收藏好后，我们开始制作藤条器具，也就是用来装粮食的大框。西班牙人在这方面非常在行，他做这个手脚灵活，编得又快又好，还常常责备我以前没有用藤条做些东西防身，但我觉得没什么必要。现在，我们已经有了足够给我预计的客人吃的粮食，所以我让西班牙人去趟大陆，看看还能替留在那边的人做什么。我给了他严格的指示，如果有人一开始就不愿在他和老野人面前发誓，保证上岛后绝不伤害我、同我斗争或者攻击我——这个他一来岛上将会看到的人，这个好心派人把他们解救出来的人，那么就别带他来了。同时他们还要发誓，当有人叛变时，他们会永远站在我这边，保护我不受伤害；无论到哪里都会完全听从我的指挥；而且这一切必须写下来，并让他们亲手签名。可是他们没有笔也没有墨水，如何做到呢？我们都没有考虑这个问题。就这样，西班牙人、老野人和星期五的父亲带着我的指示、坐着其中一只独木船出发了。那独木船可以说是他们来岛上时坐的独木船中的一只，更确切地说，是当时野人们把他们当作俘虏送到岛上来时用的独木船之一，而野人们把他们送上岛本是要吃掉他们的。我给他们一人发了一把带燧发机的火枪，然后又给了他们八份弹药，让他们尽量节省，不到紧急关头枪和弹药都不要轻易使用。这是件令人欢欣鼓舞的差事，因为这是二十七年多来我为拯救自己采取的第一步。我给了他们面包和葡萄干，足够他们吃许多天，就是加上所有的西班牙人，应该也够吃八天了。我跟他们说了一路顺风，目送他们离开。我们约定了在返航时他们挂出一个信号，这样，不等他们靠岸，我老远就能知道他们回来了。他们走的那天正好是顺风，月亮正圆，我估算应该是十月，但至于准确的日期，自从我把日历记错后，就再也弄不清楚了。我也没有准确记录年份，因而不确定自己是否正确。虽然后来我查看记录，发现我记下的年份是准确的。等他们等到至少第八天的时候，发生了一件意想不到的奇怪事情，大概在历史上都不曾有过类似的事情发生。那天早上我正在我的小屋里睡得香，星期五突然跑进来大声叫着：“主人，主人，他们来了！他们来了！”我立刻跳起来，不顾一切危险，飞快地套上衣服，穿过我的小树林——当然，现在它已经长成一片茂密的大树林了——我说不顾一切危险，是指我没有像往常一样带上武器。我放眼向海上望去，大吃一惊。在四五海里外，只见有一只船正向岸边驶来，还挂着所谓的“羊肩帆”。正是顺风，吹着那船向岸边前进。我还看到，当下的那条船并不是从大陆方向来的，而是从岛的最南端驶来的。这时，我把星期五叫到身边，吩咐他躲起来。因为那艘船上的人并非我们期盼的，是敌是友还未可知。然后我回去取来了望远镜，想认清那些人究竟是谁。我搬来了梯子，爬上了山顶——每次我有什么不安时，都会这么做，这样可以看得更清楚，并且不会被别人发现。我刚一踏上小山，就清楚地看到一艘大船停在我的东南偏南方，大约距离七八海里，离岸顶多四五海里。通过我的观察，那显然是艘英国的船，而那只小船看上去也像一条英国长艇。我简直无法表达我的困惑。尽管我看到了一艘大船，并且有理由相信那船上的人属于我的同胞，是自己人——这让我的喜悦难以言表；但有些说不清道不明的疑虑萦绕心头——我想不出这艘船从何而来——因此我不敢放松警惕。首先，我想到的是，这里并不是英国人在世界上贸易往来的要道，怎么会在这个地方出现贸易船只呢，并且我知道最近也没有暴风雨会把船刮来这一带，致使船只遇难。如果他们真的是英国人，最有可能的就是他们来此并没安好心。那我宁可继续过现在的生活，也不想落入盗贼和杀人犯的手里。有时候，人们虽然不相信自己会陷入真实的危险，但也不能低估心里得到的某些神秘的暗示和对危险的警告。对于这样的暗示和警告，我相信任何有点洞察力的人都不会忽视。毋庸置疑的是，这些暗示和警告一定来自另一个看不见的世界，一定是某种灵魂的交流。如果这种暗示是在向我们发出危险警告，我们为什么不可以猜想它们是来自某位友好的使者呢（至于这位使者是高尚还是低微那并不是问题），也许这正是出于对我们的善意呢？现在的情况充分证实了我的推断是正确的。因为不管这种神秘的警示从何而来，要是没有这种警告的话，我就不会如此小心，那我早就会陷入比以往更糟的处境了。你马上就会了解。我在山上没看多久，就发现那只小船靠近了小岛。他们好像是想找个小湾停靠，好把船开上岸来。但他们走得不够远，没发现我之前卸木排的小湾，所以只好在沙滩那边靠了岸，离我大概有半英里远，这让我觉得很庆幸。因为不然的话，我可以说，他们大概就会在我家门口上岸，然后，很快就会把我逐出我的领地，抢走我的一切。他们上岸后，我发现他们果然都是英国人，至少大多数都是；有一两个我看好像是荷兰人，但后来证明并不是。一共有十一个人，我看到其中三个人没带武器，而且似乎是被绑起来的样子。在前面的四五个人先跳上岸，然后把那三个人像俘虏一样押下船。那三人其中一个正激动地比划着什么，充满哀求、痛苦和绝望，甚至有些过于夸张了。而另外两个人，我可以察觉，他们不时举起双手，显得很不安，但不像第一个人表现得那么夸张。我被眼前的情景完全搞糊涂了，不知道这一切意味着什么。星期五在一旁尽力用英语冲我大喊：“哦，主人！你看，英国人跟野人一样要吃俘虏！”“什么，星期五？”我说，“你觉得他们会吃掉俘虏吗？”“是的。”星期五说，“他们一定会的。”“不，不。”我说，“星期五，我确实担心他们会杀了俘虏，但你要相信他们不会吃掉俘虏的。”此间，我不知道这一切到底怎么回事，只能看着眼前这可怕的景象，怔怔地站着发抖，时刻想着那三个俘虏将会被杀掉。那帮恶棍中的一人甚至举起一把水手们所称的弯刀或者短剑向那可怜的三人中的一人砍去，我眼看着那人几乎随时就要倒下，把我吓得不寒而栗。我现在迫切地想念西班牙人和跟他一起离开的老野人；我也希望自己能神不知鬼不觉地靠近他们，让他们处于我的射程内，这样我就能救出那三个人了，因为我发现他们没带枪支。但我很快就有了另外的想法。我先是看到那伙野蛮的水手把那三个人虐待了一番，之后又看到那伙人在岛上四散开来，好像要看看这片土地。而我发现那三个人也是可以自由活动的，想去哪儿去哪儿，但他们却只是在地上坐了下来，愁眉苦脸的，看上去绝望之极。这让我想起自己刚来到这岛上的光景。那时我环顾四周，觉得自己必死无疑。我惶恐地四处张望，感到难以言状的恐惧。还有我如何因为害怕被野兽吃掉，而只好在树上整整过了一宿。而我根本没想到那天晚上，暴雨和巨浪会把大船冲近海岸，让我幸运地获得了不少生活必需品，让我长久以来一直靠其获得营养和资助。就像我当初那样，这三个凄凉可怜的人也不会想到，他们一定会得到供给和救助，而且很快就会得到。他们不会知道，在这个他们觉得自己迷失而绝望的时候，他们的情况实际无比安全。在这个世界上，我们的目光多么短浅啊，我们有多么充分的理由快活地依赖于伟大的造物主啊，他怎么会让自己所创造的生灵陷入绝境。即使是最恶劣的情况，人们总也对上帝心存感激，而救赎有时候比人们想象的要来得快。不仅如此，有时让人们脱离困境的恰恰是看似给人带来毁灭的灾难。那些人上岸的时候，海水正涨到最高。当他们到处闲逛，探查此处情况时，大意地错过了潮汛。结果海水退得很远，他们的船搁浅了。他们本来留了两个人在船上，但这两人多喝了点白兰地，结果睡着了。不过其中一人较早醒了，发现小船搁浅得厉害，他根本推不动。于是他大声呼唤分散在四周的人，他们立刻集合到小船旁。但他们一起也没法推动小船，那船太重了，那片岸上的沙土又十分松软，就像流沙一样。在这种情况下，水手大概是全人类中最无远虑的家伙了，他们干脆放弃了尝试，继续在岛上四处游荡。我还听到他们中一人大声让其他人离开小船：“喂，杰克，你能不能别管它了？下次涨潮的时候，它就会浮起来了。”这下我彻底知道他们是哪国人了。这一切发生的时候，我虽然离得很近，但除了到靠近小山顶的地方观察，根本不敢离开我的城堡太远。想到自己牢固的防御工事，我感到非常庆幸。我知道至少得十个小时那船才可能再浮起来，但到时候天就黑了，那就更方便我观察他们的行动，也许还能听听他们是不是有什么计划。同时我也像以前那样做好了战斗的准备，但这次我更谨慎，因为我知道这样的敌人我是第一次遇到。我让星期五把自己武装起来，他现在已经被我训练成了一个杰出的神枪手了。我自己拿上了两把猎枪，给了他三支火枪。我现在的样子确实非常狰狞：我穿着那件吓人的羊皮外套，戴着那顶我曾提过的大帽子，身边一侧挂着把没有刀鞘的刀，腰带上别着两把手枪，双肩上还各背着一支枪。我前面说过，我的计划是这样的：天黑前不采取任何行动。大约下午两点、一天中最热的时候，他们全都三三两两地跑到了树林，我觉得大概是要躺在那里睡觉。那三个痛苦的可怜人，正为他们的处境而焦虑，哪里睡得着。他们坐在一棵大树的树阴里，大概离我一百多码远。我想其他人应该看不到他们。这时我决定去找他们，了解一些他们的情况。我立刻向他们走去，而我的仆人星期五远远地跟着我，他也是全副武装，看上去和我一样可怕，但比起我的怪物模样，他还不至于那么扎眼。我悄悄靠近他们，尽量不被发现，然后没等他们看到我，我就用西班牙语大声喊道：“先生们，你们是什么人？”他们被我的声音吓了一跳，但当他们看到我，尤其是我怪异的装扮，更是惊恐万分。他们根本连话都说不出，我感觉他们正要从我身边逃开，于是我改用英语对他们说话。“先生们，”我说，“别对我感到惊讶，也许眼前的人正是你们意想不到的朋友呢。”“那他一定是天堂派来的了。”其中的一个人严肃地说，同时向我脱帽致敬。“因为我们的处境已经不是人力所能挽救的了。”“一切救赎都来自天堂，先生。”我说，“但你能拒绝一个陌生人的帮助吗？因为你们看起来有些走投无路了。你们上岸的时候我就看到你们了。你们似乎在跟那帮走向你们的禽兽哀求什么，我看见他们其中一个人举起了刀想要杀掉你们。”那个可怜的人，泪流满面地颤抖着，他看起来十分惊愕，回答道：“我到底是在跟上帝说话，还是在跟人说话？你到底是人，还是天使？”“别为此害怕，先生。”我说，“如果上帝派一个天使来拯救你，这个天使应该会比我穿戴得好，武器装备应该也会跟我不一样。请别担心了，我是一个人，一个英国人，并且想要帮助你们。你们看，我只有一个仆人，加上武器和弹药，坦率地告诉我们，我们能帮到你们吗？到底发生什么事了？”“先生，关于我们的事，”他说，“想要杀我们的人离我们太近了，我很难一下子跟你讲清楚。简单地说，先生，我就是那条船的船长——而我的船员背叛了我。我费尽力气说服他们不要杀我，于是他们就把我送到这个荒凉的地方来了，还有他们俩——一个是我的大副，一个是乘客。我们觉得在这个荒无人烟的岛上肯定是死定了，也不知道该怎么办才好。”“那些畜生，你们的敌人，现在在哪儿呢？”我问，“你知道他们去哪儿了吗？”“他们在那里躺着呢，先生。”他指着一片茂密的树林说道，“一想到他们可能已经看到了我们并听到了你的话，我就吓得发抖。如果真是这样的话，他们一定会把我们都杀了的。”“他们有枪支吗？”我问。他回答说：“他们只有两支枪，其中一支留在船上了。”“那好，”我说，“剩下的都交给我吧。我看到他们都睡着了，现在要把他们都杀了很容易。不过，不如我们让他们成为俘虏？”他告诉我，那些人中有两个是亡命之徒，如果存有怜悯之心的话会很危险；但如果把这两人解决了，他相信剩下的人便会各归各位、安守本分了。我问他是哪两个人。他说太远了辨别不清，但他会完全服从我的一切指示。“好吧，”我说，“让我们退出他们视线之外，以免他们醒来后听到或看到。然后我们再进一步商量商量。”于是他们很乐意地跟着我往回走，直到树林把我们掩蔽起来。</td>
		<td class="en">In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their coming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration; being likewise assured by Friday’s father that I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go.But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast away and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life.I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods they could meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own men were drowned when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been devoured every moment.He told me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used at their first landing to provide themselves with some food.I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had formed any design of making their escape.He said they had many consultations about it; but that having neither vessel nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair.I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might not be done.I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they had received so much as they did by the advantages they expected.I told him it would be very hard that I should be made the instrument of their deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither;and that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition.I added that, otherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a barque large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast northward;but that if, in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill-used for my kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before.He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their condition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return again and bring me their answer; that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my direction as their commander and captain; and they should swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such country as I intended, and that he would bring a contract from them, under their hands, for that purpose.Then he told me he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me as long as he lived till I gave him orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen.He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat.But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year.The case was thus: he had been with us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up;which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to four; but much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come over;and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America;so he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come;for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another.“You know,” says he, “the children of Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God Himself, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the wilderness.”His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted;and in about a month’s time, by the end of which it was seed time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed two and twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare:Having now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found occasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.For this purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their work.I showed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they made about a dozen large planks, of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine.At the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats as much as I could; and for this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our flock.But above all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, formed a great part of our food—very good living too, I assure you, for they are exceedingly nourishing.It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world; that is to say, any part of America.When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do with those he had left behind him there.I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man who would not first swear in the presence of himself and the old savage that he would in no way injure, fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to send for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand by him and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went would be entirely under and subjected to his command; and that this should be put in writing, and signed in their hands.How they were to have done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which we never asked.Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to have come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages.I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasions.This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in view of my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days.I gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards—for about eight days’ time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should know them again when they came back, at a distance, before they came on shore.They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at full, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it again; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history.I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, “Master, master, they are come, they are come!”I jumped up, and regardless of danger I went, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger I went without my arms, which was not my custom to do; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed, presently, that they did not come from that side which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island.Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies.In the next place I went in to fetch my perspective glass to see what I could make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer without being discovered.I had scarce set my foot upon the hill when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance from me, SSE., but not above a league and a half from the shore.By my observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an English longboat.I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me—I cannot tell from whence they came—bidding me keep upon my guard.In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what business an English ship could have in that part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there in distress;and that if they were really English it was most probable that they were here upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of its being real.That such hints and notices are given us I believe few that have made any observation of things can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt;and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are given for our good?The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been done inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will see presently.I had not kept myself long in this posture till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.When they were on shore I was fully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed and, as I thought, bound;and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the boat as prisoners: one of the three I could perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first.I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it should be.Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could, “O master!You see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans.”“Why, Friday,” said I, “do you think they are going to eat them, then?”“Yes,” says Friday, “they will eat them.”“No, no,” said I, “Friday, I am afraid they will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure they will not eat them.”All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the three prisoners should be killed;nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall every moment; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins.I wished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that had gone with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have secured the three men, for I saw no firearms they had among them; but it fell out to my mind another way.After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the country.I observed that the three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair.This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore, and began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts.As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been so long nourished and supported;so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and really they were in a condition of safety, at the same time that they thought themselves lost and their case desperate.So little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction.It was just at high-water when these people came on shore; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground.They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about: upon which they all soon came to the boat: but it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand.In this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, “Why, let her alone, Jack, can’t you? She’ll float next tide;” by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were.All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my castle any farther than to my place of observation near the top of the hill: and very glad I was to think how well it was fortified.I knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if they had any.In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle as before, though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first.I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms.I took myself two fowling pieces, and I gave him three muskets.My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goatskin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it was dark; but about two o’clock, being the heat of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep.The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn something of their condition; immediately I marched as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did.I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, “What are ye, gentlemen?”They started up at the noise, but were ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made.They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.“Gentlemen,” said I, “do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have a friend near when you did not expect it.”“He must be sent directly from heaven then,” said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me; “for our condition is past the help of man.”“All help is from heaven, sir,” said I, “but can you put a stranger in the way to help you?For you seem to be in some great distress.I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to make application to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.”The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, “Am I talking to God or man?Is it a real man or an angel?”“Be in no fear about that, sir,” said I; “if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed after another manner than you see me; pray lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you; you see I have one servant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve you?What is your case?”“Our case, sir,” said he, “is too long to tell you while our murderers are so near us; but, in short, sir, I was commander of that ship—my men have mutinied against me;they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me—one my mate, the other a passenger—where we expected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.”“Where are these brutes, your enemies?” said I; “do you know where they are gone?There they lie, sir,” said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; “my heart trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly murder us all.”“Have they any firearms?”said I.He answered, “They had only two pieces, one of which they left in the boat.”“Well, then,” said I, “leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take them prisoners?”He told me there were two desperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty.I asked him which they were.He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct.“Well,” said I, “let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further.”So they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请听好，先生，”我说，“如果我冒险把你们救出来，你们愿意答应我两个条件吗？”他没等我说完，就抢着表示，如果我能解救他并收复大船，他和他的船员都将会完全听从我的一切指示和命令。如果大船收复不了的话，我把他送到世界的任何地方，他都会与我同生共死。另外两个人也如此表示。“好的，”我说，“我只有两个条件：第一，你们留在岛上的这段时间，决不能侵犯我的主权；如果我把武器交给你们，不论什么情况下，一旦我要拿回来，你们就得给我；还有，不能对我或我手下的人有意见，同时得服从我的命令。第二，如果你们收回了那条船，你们得免费送我和我的同伴回英国。”他向我作出了一切人们能想到的、信得过的保证。他说他完全接受这些合情合理的要求然后照做，并且他会永远记得欠我一条命，在有生之年，在任何情况下，他都会以命偿还。“那么现在这样，”我说，“这里三支火枪给你们，还有火药和子弹。告诉我，你们认为接下来该做什么？”他竭尽所能表达了自己的感激之情，但只是说会完全服从我的指挥。我告诉他，我认为现在很难冒险行动，我能想到最好的办法就是他们一躺下我们就立刻向他们开火，如果第一排枪放过后有人没被打死且愿意投降的话，我们或许可以饶了他们。开火过程就全看上帝的旨意吧。船长十分谦恭地说，如果可以的话，他并不愿杀死他们。但其中两个人实在是无可救药的恶棍，是船上一切叛变的罪魁祸首，如果他们逃脱了的话，那我们就白干了。因为他们会回到船上，同船上的同伙发起又一场叛变，把我们都杀掉。“那好吧，”我说，“我的建议也是迫不得已，因为这是我们自救的唯一办法。”然而，看到他仍然对屠杀很谨慎，我便让他们自己去想办法，觉得怎么方便就怎么办吧。商量到一半，我们听到那边有些人醒了，很快我们就看到有两个人站了起来。我问船长那两人中有没有这次反叛的头子。他说：“没有。”“那好吧，”我说，“你就放了他们吧，上帝似乎也在刻意地叫醒他们好让他们逃命。”现在，”我说，“如果剩下的人跑掉，那就是你的过错了。这让他感到愉快，于是他拿起我给他的火枪，又将一把手枪插在皮带上。他的两个同伴跟着他，一个人拿了一把手枪。他的两个同伴走在前面，弄出了一点动静，那两个水手中的一个人听到，醒了过来，转身看到了他们走来，于是向其他人大喊起来。但是太迟了，他刚一出声，他们就开枪了——我指的是除了船长外的另外两人，船长很明智地没有开枪。他们开枪时瞄得很准，那两人中的一个当场被打死了，另一个也受了重伤，但没死。他惊跳起来，急切地向他的同伴求助。这时船长已经走到他跟前，告诉他求救已经太迟了，他应该请求上帝宽恕他的暴行。说完，船长就用他的火枪的枪托将他打倒，于是他再也没说话了。跟那两个水手一起的还有三个人，其中一个受了轻伤。这时我已经到了；他们意识到危险，并且知道反抗是没有用的，于是他们开始求饶。船长告诉他们，他可以饶他们不死，只要他们保证，他们对自己所犯下的反叛罪行感到悔恨，并发誓效忠于船长，帮他夺回大船，并将其开回牙买加——他们出发的地点。他们信誓旦旦地表明了自己的忠诚，船长相信了，没有杀他们。我没有反对，只是要求船长在他们留在岛上的期间，把他们的手脚都绑起来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Look you, sir,” said I, “if I venture upon your deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions with me?”He anticipated my proposals by telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded by me in everything; and if the ship was not recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world soever I would send him; and the two other men said the same.“Well,” said I, “my conditions are but two; first, that while you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the meantime be governed by my orders; secondly, that if the ship is or may be recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage free.”He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could devise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and besides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived.“Well, then,” said I, “here are three muskets for you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done.”He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be wholly guided by me.I told him I thought it was very hard venturing anything; but the best method I could think of was to fire on them at once as they lay, and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God’s providence to direct the shot.He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill them if he could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still, for they would go on board and bring the whole ship’s company, and destroy us all.“Well, then,” said I, “necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to save our lives.”However, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient.In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet.I asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny?He said, “No.”“Well, then,” said I, “you may let them escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now,” said I, “if the rest escape you, it is your fault.”Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand;the two men who were with him going first made some noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about, and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but was too late then, for the moment he cried out they fired—I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece.They had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there were three more in the company, and one of them was slightly wounded.By this time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy.The captain told them he would spare their lives if they would give him an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came.They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be desired; and he was willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not against, only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were on the island.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >与此同时，我让星期五和船长的大副一起去看守大船，并把船上的桨和帆都拿下来，他们一一照办了。不久，三个脱离同伙的人（他们该为自己的掉队庆幸）在听到枪声后回来了。他们看到此前还是他们俘虏的船长，现在已经成了他们的征服者。于是他们也投降了，乖乖被绑了起来。就这样我们大获全胜。现在，我和船长就有时间来仔细打听彼此的情况了。我首先告诉了他我的整个经历，船长专心地听着，甚至露出了惊愕的神情——尤其是我说到我是怎么用奇妙的方式得到粮食和弹药的时候。并且，确实，因为我的经历就是由一个个奇迹组成的，这让他十分感动。可是当他由此联想到自己的遭遇，以及上帝似乎是有意让我存活下来去拯救他的生命时，他泪流满面，再也说不出话来。我们的谈话结束后，我带着他和他的两个属下去了我的住处。还是从我出来的屋顶带着他们翻了进去，然后拿出我的粮食招待他们，并向他们展示我在岛上这么长时间以来发明的所有设备。所有我让他们看到的和告诉他们的一切都让他们惊奇万分。而船长最佩服的还是我的防御工事，以及我是怎样把我的住所完全隐蔽在一片小树林之中的。那片小树林已经种了有近二十年了，这里的树长得比英国的树快得多，因此现在已经成为一片小森林。它是如此茂密，除了我特意留出来的蜿蜒小径，其他地方根本无路可走。我告诉他这就是我的城堡和住所，但就像大多数王子一样，我在乡间还有一处住所，这样一来有需要的话我可以撤到那里。我说改天会带他们去看看那里，但眼下我们的任务是想想怎么收复那条船。对此，船长同意我的看法，但说他完全不知道该采取什么措施。因为船上还有二十六个人，他们既然已经参加了这该死的阴谋，在法律上已经犯了死罪，而现在他们又身处绝境，一定会更加顽强抵抗，拼死到底。因为他们知道，如果失败的话，他们一到英国或者任何英国殖民地就会立马被送上绞刑架。因此我们区区这几个人，是没法攻击他们的。我想了会儿他的话，觉得很有道理，因此觉得有必要尽快作出决定。我们得出其不意地把船上的人引入某个圈套，以防他们上岸来消灭我们。于是我立刻想到，再过一会儿，大船上的人一定会纳闷他们的同伴及其小船发生了什么事。然后，他们就会坐上另一只小船来岛上找他们。那时，他们可能会全副武装地过来，对我们来说未免过于强大了。船长也觉得很有道理。于是我告诉他，我们首先要做的事是把沙滩上的小船敲破，再把船上的东西都拿出来，让它无法下水，这样他们就没法把它划走。于是我们上了小船，拿走了留在船上的武器，和我们能找到的所有其他东西。其中有一瓶白兰地，一瓶朗姆酒，一些饼干，一角火药，和一大块用帆布包着的糖（大约有五六磅重）。这些都是我非常喜欢的，尤其是白兰地和糖，我已近很多年没碰过了。我们把这些东西拿上岸后（桨、桅杆、帆和舵之前已经拿走了），就在船底敲了个大洞。这样，即使他们有足够的实力战胜我们，也没法把小船开走了。事实上，我对我们收复大船并没什么把握。但我想的是，只要他们不把小船带走，我把它重新修好是没什么问题的，这样我们就可以乘它去利华德群岛，并顺道拜访我的西班牙朋友们，因为我还惦记着他们。</td>
		<td class="en">While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s mate to the boat with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they did; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another’s circumstances.I began first, and told him my whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amazement—and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply.But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.After this communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting that place.All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now planted nearly twenty years,and the trees growing much faster than in England, was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in any part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage into it.I told him this was my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too another time; but at present our business was to consider how to recover the ship.He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on,knowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a number as we were.I mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a very rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us.Upon this, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship’s crew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and that then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed to be rational.Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry her of, and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim.Accordingly, we went on board, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found there—which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years.When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat.Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to make her again fit to carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my thoughts.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是我们准备按计划行事，我们先用尽全力把小船推向沙滩较高的地方，涨潮时潮水就不会把她从高水位线上冲走。况且，我们已经在船底凿破了个大洞，短时间内是修不好的。然后，我们坐下来，正想着接下来该做什么，突然听到大船上有人开了一枪，并摇动旗帜发出让小船回到大船上去的信号，但小船毫无动静，于是他们又开了好几枪，向小船发了些别的信号。最终，所有的信号和枪声都毫无效果，他们发现小船根本一动不动。我们用望远镜看到，他们又吊起了另一只小船，向岸上划来。随着他们靠近，我们发现小船上至少有十个人，都带着枪支。当船离海岸大约六海里的时候,他们过来的整个情况我们都可以看清，甚至还能看清他们的脸。海浪把他们的船冲到了岸上另一只船的东边，于是他们又沿着海岸往西划，向着另一只船靠岸和停泊的地方而去。我是说，这样一来我们可以把他们看得一清二楚，船长认出了船上的人都是谁，也能说出他们的品行如何。他说，在他们之中，有三个非常老实的人，他相信他们是在其他人的恐吓威胁下被逼无奈加入了这场阴谋。但那个看起来是他们头目的水手长和其余的人却是船员中十分凶狠的家伙，他们无疑已经是孤注一掷了。船长很担心对方的实力对于我们来说太过强大。我朝他笑了笑，告诉他，在我们这般处境下的人根本已经没什么好害怕的了，因为不管将会遇到什么情况，总比现在这样要好一些。我们应该预料到，结果无论是生是死，一定会是一种解脱。我问船长,他对于我的处境有何看法，我是否值得为得到解脱而冒险？“先生，你刚刚那些信念哪儿去了？”我说，“你刚刚不是还相信我在这里是为了拯救你们的吗？你刚刚不是还因此振作起来了吗？在我看来，”我说，“将来看似只有一件事有问题。”“什么事？”他问。“呃，”我说，“那就是，刚刚你说的那其中三四个老实人应该被饶恕。但如果他们也是船上最邪恶的暴徒，我觉得也应该把他们挑出来并送到你手中，是上帝的旨意。因为毫无疑问，每一个上岸的人都将成为我们的俘虏，至于是生是死，就要看他们对待我们的态度了。”我说这话的时候，声调上扬，表情愉悦，我发现这大大激励了船长,于是我们干劲十足地开始行动了。那只小船刚从大船上放下来的时候，我们就想着要把岛上的俘虏分散，而最终，我们也确实把他们有效地安排妥当了。其中让船长更不放心的那两个人，我让星期五和三个被解救中的一人把他们送到我的洞室里去。那个洞足够偏远，外人不会听到声音或发现他们；而他们如果能挣脱的话，也不可能在树林里找到路出来。星期五他们把那两个人绑了，但是给了他们粮食，并向他们承诺，如果他们能继续乖乖呆着，一两天内就给会放了他们，但如果他们试图逃跑的话，一定会立刻毫不留情地杀了他们。他们真诚地保证会耐心地呆在洞里，并且十分感激我们这么善待他们，留给他们粮食和光亮，因为星期五为了让他们舒适些，给了他们几支蜡烛（我们自制的那种）。但他们不知道，星期五一直在洞口站着看守他们。其他的俘虏则受到了更好的待遇。其中两个一直被捆着，因为船长不信任他们。另外两个被我选为己用，因为船长的推荐，也因为他们与我们同生共死的庄重誓言。这样一来，加上他们和正直的船长一伙三人，我们一共有七个人，并且都全副武装。我毫不怀疑我们能很好地应付那正在往这边来的十个人，况且船长说过那里面也还有三四个老实的人呢。那些人一到另一只船搁浅的地点，就将船驶上沙滩，然后他们全都上了岸，将船往岸上拖。他们这样的举动让我很高兴，因为我本来怕他们在离岸较远的地方下锚，然后再留些人在船上看守，这样的话我就没法弄到那只船了。他们上岸后的第一件事就是全体奔向他们的另一只小船，不难看出，当他们看到船上空空如也，只剩船底一个大洞时，都大吃了一惊。他们考虑了一下眼前的情况，然后发出了三两声大叫，竭尽全力高声呼喊，试图让他们的同伴听见，但一切都是徒劳。然后他们又围成一圈，放了一排枪。我们当然是听到了，枪声在树林中回荡着。但结果还是一样。那些在山洞里的人，我确信他们听不到。而其余在我们手下的，虽然听得很清楚，也不敢对他们有任何回应。大船上来的那些人对此事大为惊讶，他们后来告诉我们，他们当时决定先全部回到大船上，让船上的人知道，第一批来的人已经全部被害，而且那只长艇也被破坏了。于是他们又立刻把小船推到水里，全部上了小船。船长对他们这一举动很吃惊，简直是惊慌失措。他认为他们会回到大船上然后把大船开走，因为他们一定相信同伙已经没命了。那样一来，我们收复大船的希望还是会落空。但他很快就被那帮人的相反举动弄得惶恐不安起来。他们把小船划走没多久，我们发现他们又一次回到了岸上。大概他们已经一起商量过了，这次采取了新的措施。他们留了三个人在船上，其余人上了岸，深入小岛寻找他们的同伴。这让我们失望极了，因为这下子我们不知如何是好，因为如果我们让小船开走的话，就算是把岛上这七个人抓起来也没用，因为他们一定会把小船划回大船，留在小船上的三个人一定会权衡考虑，然后把大船开走，那样我们就无法收复大船了。但是我们没有别的办法，只能等待，静观事态的进展。那七个人上了岸，剩下三个留在船上，把小船停在距岸边有一段距离的地方，下了锚等同伴回来。因此我们也无法攻击小船上的人。那些上岸的人一直是集体行动，向小山顶前进，而我的住处就在那座小山脚下。我们可以清楚地看到他们，但他们看不到我们。如果他们再靠近点儿的话我们就该高兴了，因为我们就能向他们开枪，但他们要是走远了也不错，那样我们就能到外面去了。他们上了山脊，看到山谷和森林远远地向东北部延伸着，那是小岛上地势最低之处。他们又大喊大叫了一阵，直到精疲力尽才停下来。他们好像并没有远离海岸、继续深入探险的打算，也不想彼此远离，于是就在一棵树下坐下来想办法。如果他们像之前那帮人一样选择在那里睡一觉的话，倒是帮了我们大忙。但他们忧患意识太强，因而不敢入睡。不过他们并不知道自己会惧怕什么危险。趁他们讨论时，船长向我提了个很合理的建议，他说他们应该还会再放一排枪，以试图让同伴们听到，而我们就在他们刚开完枪、还来不及装子弹时将他们包围，这样他们自然就会投降，我们不用流血就能把他们制服。我喜欢这个提议，但前提是我们得离他们足够近，近到能在他们重新换上子弹前将他们包围。可是这件事情并没有发生。我们又等了很长时间，踌躇不定，不知如何是好。最后，我只能对他们说，现在什么也做不了，我想只能等到晚上。到那时，如果他们不返回小船的话，也许我们能想到什么办法包抄到他们和海岸之间，然后再用什么计策把小船上的人引上岸来。等他们行动虽然等得很不耐烦，可我们还是等了很长时间。当看到他们经过长时间的讨论后，突然全都站了起来向海边前进，我们感到极为不安。他们似乎非常畏惧这里的危险，所以决定再次回到船上，放弃寻找他们的同伴，然后按原计划继续他们的航行。当我看到他们往岸上走，我就猜到他们大概是要放弃搜寻回去了。而当我告诉船长我的想法后，他又开始为此担忧而变得消沉了。但我很快想到一个让他们折回的办法，而且也毫厘不爽地达到了我的目的。我命令星期五和船长的大副一起越过小河往西走，走到野人押着星期五上岸的地方。当他们走到大概半英里外一片较高的地方后，我命令他们尽量大声喊叫，一直喊到水手们听到为止。我让星期五和大副在听到回答后再回应几声，然后别让他们看见，绕个圈子，他们喊的时候就不断回应几声，这样尽量将他们引向小岛深处和密林之间。最后再按照我指定的路线迂回到我身边。当星期五和大副开始喊叫的时候，那些人正要上船。他们听到了叫声，做出了回应，并沿着岸向西边、向他们听到的声音跑去，直到被小河挡住去路，小河正涨水，他们没法过河，只能去叫小船过来帮他们过河。这正如我所料。他们过了河后，我看到小船在小河上驶了一大段距离，好像进到了一个内河港口。他们从船上又叫下三人中的一个人同行，只留了两个人在船上，这两人把小船栓在岸边一棵小树的树桩上。这正是我希望的。于是，我让星期五和船长的大副继续干他们的事，我带上其余的人出发。我们避开他们的视线过了小河，出其不意地让他们吃了一惊。当时，那两人一个躺在岸上，一个在船上呆着。岸上那个人正在半睡半醒间，他正想要跳起来，但走在最前面的船长跑向他，把他打倒在地。然后船长又向留在小船上的那个喊话，让他快点投降，不然就只有死路一条了。当一个人看到五个人站在他面前，而他的同伴已经被打倒时，劝他投降并非难事。况且，这似乎还是船长说的那三个不像其余船员那般热衷参加叛变的人中的一个，所以他很容易就被说服了，不但投降，之后还忠心地加入到我们这边来。同时，星期五和船长大副的那份差事也完成得很好，他们通过喊叫和回应，把那些剩下的人从一座山带到另一座山，从一片树林带到另一片树林，不但让那些人精疲力竭，还把他们丢在那里，使他们在天黑之前绝不可能回到小船上。而当星期五和大副回到我们身边时，也已是疲惫不堪。现在我们没事做了，只能在暗处监视他们，并准备随时反动进攻，一举击溃他们。星期五回来好几个小时后，那些人才回到小船上。我们大老远就能听到走在最前边的人在说话，喊着让后边的人快点。也能听到后边人的回答，且抱怨着他们是如何腿酸，如何劳累，再也走不动了——这正是我们乐意听到的消息。最后，他们终于走到小船停泊之处，却发现因为退潮的缘故，小船在小湾那里搁浅了，而留在小船里的两个人也不知去向，那帮人惊慌的样子真是难以形容。我们可以听到他们近乎凄惨地呼唤着彼此，说他们被困在一座受了诅咒的岛上。如果这里住着人，他们肯定都会被杀光。如果这里有妖怪恶魔，他们肯定会被抓走吃掉。他们又开始叫喊起来，并喊着那两个同伴的名字。他们喊了很多次，但没有人回答。又过了一会儿，我们能在微亮的暮光中看到他们到处跑，绝望地绞着双手。他们一会儿坐到小船上歇一歇，一会儿又跑到岸上开始四处走动，反反复复。我的手下们恨不得我立刻下令让他们趁着夜色攻过去，但我还想找个更有利的机会，以便能放过一些人，尽量少杀死几个。尤其我不希望任何我手下的人去冒生命危险，因为我知道那帮人都全副武装。我决定再等等，看看他们会不会分散开来。因此，为了保证能制服他们，我把我们的埋伏又向前推进了一点，然后命令星期五和船长匍匐前进，尽可量贴紧地面以免被发现，在对方开火前尽可能地靠近些。他们用那种姿势爬了没多久，那个水手长，也就是这次叛乱的头目，带着两个船员向他们走来，水手长看起来比其他人更为沮丧和绝望。船长急切地想亲自教训这个流氓头子主犯，根本没耐心等到他走近以便确认清楚是他，因为他们以前只听过他的声音。但当那三个人又走近了些，船长和星期五就跳起来，向他们飞扑过去。水手长当场被打死了，边上的人也被击中身体，倒在水手长身边，但过了一两个小时才死去。第三个人见状拔腿就跑。枪声一响，我立刻让我的队伍向前进。现在我们有八个人：我自己、总司令、星期五、我的副司令、船长和他的两个属下，和三个我们信得过的给了他们武器装备的战俘。我们向那帮人发起了攻击，夜色中他们无法辨认我们有多少人。我让原来留在小船上、但现在已经听令于我们的那个人喊他们的名字，看看有没有可能让他们和我们谈判，以达成协议。结果正是意料之中：不难想象，就他们目前的情况来看，他们应该是很愿意投降的。于是，那人尽量大声叫着他们其中的一人：“汤姆·史密斯！汤姆·史密斯！”汤姆·史密斯立刻回答道：“是鲁滨孙吗？”他好像听出了是谁的声音。于是这边的人又喊道：“是的，是的。看在上帝的份上，汤姆·史密斯，快放下武器投降吧，否则你们立马就都没命了。”“我们向谁投降？他们在哪里？”史密斯问。“就在这里，”这边的人说，“我们的船长在这里，还有五十个人跟他一块儿，他们找了你们两个小时了。水手长已经被杀死了，维尔·弗莱也受伤了，我成了俘虏，如果你们再不投降就死定了。”“那么，他们会饶恕我们吗？”汤姆·史密斯说道，“如果可以，我们就投降。”“如果你们承诺会投降的话，我去问问。”鲁滨孙说。于是他请示了船长，然后船长开始亲自喊话：“你，史密斯，你听得出我的声音。如果你们立刻放下武器投降的话，可以保存性命，但威尔·阿金斯例外。”听到这话，威尔·阿金斯叫起来：“看在上帝的面子上，船长，饶了我吧！我做什么了？他们不都跟我一样坏吗？”但他说得不对，貌似在他们最初叛乱之时，就是这个威尔·阿金斯把船长抓了起来，野蛮地捆住他的双手，还恶语中伤他。但船长告诉他先自行放下武器，然后听从总督的处理——那个总督就是指我，他们都叫我总督。总之，那帮人全都放下了武器，并向我求饶。我让先前和他们谈判的那个人和另外两人过去把他们都绑了起来。然后，我的五十大军——实际上才八个人——上前去把他们和小船都收押了起来。我和另外一人因为身份原因没有露面。我们的下一个工作就是修补小船，并想想怎么收复大船。而船长现在能有时间去和那些人谈判了，他跟他们讲道理，指出了他们对他的恶劣行径、险恶用心，并告诉他们，这些最后一定会带给他们不幸和灾难，甚至可能将他们送上绞刑架。他们似乎都听得很认真，并拼命地请求饶命。而船长说他们并不是他的俘虏，而是这个岛上总指挥的俘虏。他说，他本以为自己被送到了一个荒无人烟的岛上，但上帝的指示把他们送到了有人居住的岛上，他们在岛上遇到了人，而且总督还是个英国人。如果这个总督高兴的话，他可以把所有人都绞死在这里；但他饶恕了所有人。船长猜测，总督大概要把他们送到英国依法惩治，但阿金斯除外。总督下令说让阿金斯准备受死，明天一早他就会被绞死。虽然这些话全都是船长自己编出来的，但也达到了想要的效果。阿金斯跪下来请求船长去向总督求情，饶他不死；而其他人也都请求船长看在上帝的面子上，不要把他们送到英国去。这时我突然想到，我们逃离这里的时候到了。现在很容易说服这些人，让他们全心全意帮忙收复大船。所以我在夜色掩护下离开了他们，他们并不知道所谓的总督是个怎样的人。然后我想把船长叫过来，但那时距离太远，我就让其中一个人去传话，那人对船长说：“船长，司令叫你。”船长立刻回答道：“告诉司令大人我马上就过去。”这样就更加唬住了那些人，他们都相信了那个总督和他的五十手下就在附近。船长来了后，我告诉他我收复大船的计划。他十分赞同，并决心第二天早上就执行。但是为了让这个计划执行得更巧妙，更万无一失，我告诉他我们必须把俘虏分开处理，要把阿金斯和另外两个最坏的人绑起来，带到我们关押之前那些人的山洞中去。这件事交给了星期五和那两个同船长一道上岸的人去做。星期五他们把那些人押到了山洞，就像押到监狱跟前一样。而处于他们的处境下，山洞也确实是个凄凉可怕的地方。我派人将其他的俘虏送去了我的别墅，这个别墅我此前已经作了详细的描述。那边有篱笆，加上那些人都被绑着，应该是足够可靠的。没人敢乱来，因为他们知道，自己的命运取决于自己现在的表现。到了早上，我便派船长去跟他们谈判，总之，就是去试探试探他们，然后回来向我汇报，如果让他们一起去收复大船的话，我们是否信得过他们。船长跟他们细数他们对他的伤害以及他们现在的处境。他还说，现在看来，虽然总督已经饶了他们的命，但如果他们被送回英国的话，还是难逃被铁链吊死的命运。但是，如果他们愿意加入我们，一起去努力收复大船的话，他会向总督请求饶恕他们。完全可以想象，那些人处于这样的境地，是多么乐意接受这个建议。他们向船长跪下，带着最诚恳的祈求，郑重承诺说，他们会效忠他到最后一刻，他们欠他一命，愿追随他到天涯海角，并且有生之年会向对待父亲一样对待他。“好的。”船长说，“那我得去把你们的话告诉总督，并努力让他相信你们。”于是船长回来把他们的性格脾气一一向我作了汇报，并说他真的相信他们会忠心于我。但是，我们必须非常谨慎。于是我让他再去一趟，并选出五个人来。我让船长告诉那些人，他现在不缺人手，只要五个人做他的助手就够了。总督要把其他两个人和那三个已经被押送到城堡（也就是我的洞穴）去的人留下来作人质，以确保那五个人的忠诚。如果这五个人在行动中有任何不忠的表现，那五个人质将会在岸上被铁链活活吊死。这看起来很严厉，使他们相信总督这次是认真的。但是，他们别无选择只能接受。于是现在的情况就是，被囚禁的人要跟船长一起，尽责地劝告那参加行动的五个人要忠心耿耿、全力以赴。就这样，我们的出征兵力安排妥当了：首先是船长、他的大副和乘客，其次是第一伙人中的两个囚犯，我从船长那里了解到了他们的品行，已给予了他们自由，并信任地给了他们武器；再次是另外两个水手，我仍然把他们捆着关在我的别墅里，但在船长的建议下也把他们释放了。最后是被释放的那五个人。所以现在总共有十二个人参与行动，还有五个人被关在洞里作人质。我问船长他是否愿意冒险带着这些人去收复大船，因为考虑到现在岛上还有七个俘虏，我觉得我和星期五不适合参加行动。而且我们得把他们分散着看管，还得给他们提供食物，任务也够多了。对于那五个关在洞里的俘虏，我决定紧紧看住他们，只是让星期五每天去两次，给他们送去必需品。我让另外两个俘虏把食物送到某一特定地点，星期五会到那里去取食物。我是跟着船长一起在那两名人质面前出现的，船长告诉他们我是总督派来看管他们的，总督不愿意看到他们做出除了我指令外的其他行动。如果他们违背命令，他们就会被送到城堡里，用铁链锁起来。就这样，为了不让他们知道我就是所谓的总督，我以另一个身份出现，并在任何情况下都提到总督、军队、城堡等问题。现在船长面前没什么难题了，他要做的就是装备好那两只小船，把其中一只的裂口修补好，并分派人员上去。他让他的乘客做了一条小船的船长，派给他四名水手。而他自己、大副和其他五名水手上了另一条小船。他们的行动很顺利，大约午夜时分就靠近了大船。他们一到达能向大船喊话的距离之内时，船长就让那个也叫鲁滨孙的水手向他们打招呼，告诉他们人和船已经回来了，找到他们花了不少时间。就这样，船长他们一边跟大船上的人喊着话，一边靠到了大船一侧。小船一靠近，船长和大副就首先带着武器跳上大船，飞快地用火枪的枪尾把二副和木匠击倒了，而跟随他们的水手也表现得非常忠诚。他们制服了前后甲板上的其他人，又关紧舱口，把舱里的人全关在了下面。这时，另一条小船上的人从大船前端的铁链爬上了大船，占领了艏楼和通往厨房的小舱口，并把他们遇到的三个人收为俘虏。等这些完成后，甲板上就彻底安全了。船长命令大副带着三个人冲进后甲板舱室，那个叛变的新船长就在那里躺着。他听到了警报，已经爬了起来。他的身边还有两个水手和一个小差，手里都有枪。大副用一根铁撬杠把门劈开时，那个新船长和他的手下疯狂地开了火，一颗火枪子弹打伤了大副的胳膊，还有另外两个水手也受了伤，但是没人死亡。大副虽然受了伤，还是一边呼唤着救援一边冲进了后甲板舱室，并用他的手枪射穿了新船长的脑袋。子弹从他的嘴里射进去，又从他一只耳朵的后部穿出，于是那个新船长再说不出话来了。其他人看到这情况也都屈服了。就这样，我们顺利地夺回了大船，没有损失一人。收复大船后，船长命令开了七枪，这是我和他约定的信号，告知我事情成功了。我一直坐在岸边观望、等候消息，直到快到凌晨两点时才听到了枪声，你能想象，我是欣喜万分。清楚听到枪声信号后，我就躺了下来。这一天我太劳累了，很快就睡熟了，直到一声枪响把我惊醒，我立刻跳起来，听到有人在叫我“总督！总督！”我立即听出来那是船长的声音，我爬上小山顶，果然看到他站在那里。船长指了指大船，然后拥抱了我。“我亲爱的朋友，我的救命恩人，”他说，“这是你的船，完全属于你，还有我也是，这条船上的一切也都是你的。”我把目光投向大船，她正停在离岸半英里多远的地方。因为船长他们夺回大船后，见天气晴朗，就起了锚，把船开到了小河口。当时正在涨潮，船长就把小船划到了我当初停泊木筏的地方附近，也就正好在我的城堡口处上了岸。我开始时几乎要因为这巨大的喜讯晕倒了。因为我眼见我脱险之事已经是十拿九稳，一切都这么顺利，还有一艘大船能带我去任何我想去的地方。起初那一会儿功夫，我根本没法回答船长的话。要不是船长紧紧搂着我、我也紧紧抓着他，我大概早就倒地了。他见我如此惊喜，立刻从口袋里拿出一个瓶子，给我喝了点甘露酒，那是他特地给我带来的。我喝了酒，在地上坐了下来。虽然酒让我清醒了点，但还是过了好长时间，才能够同他说话。这时船长也跟我一样狂喜，只是不像我表现得那般惊奇。他说了许多亲切友好的话，让我安定、清醒过来。但我心中的快乐是如此汹涌，使得我的精神意识变得模糊。最后我放声大哭，又过了一会儿才终于能够说话。这次我拥抱了船长，说他才是我的救命恩人。我们一起喜不自禁。我告诉他，我把他看作是天堂派来拯救我的人，这整件事简直就是由一连串奇迹组成的。这种种迹象似乎都在证明着上帝的神秘之手在冥冥之中操控着这个世界，他无所不能，他的眼睛能看到这个世界上最偏远的角落，并且只要他愿意，便会向身处苦难的人伸出援手。我没有忘记对上天表示我的感激之情。我在这个荒芜的小岛上、在如此孤苦的环境中得以生存下来，正是上帝用奇迹般的方式为我提供食宿，正是上帝的恩赐让我一次次地死里逃生。他如此仁慈博爱，谁又能不心存感激地赞美上帝呢。我们谈了一会儿后，船长告诉我他给我带了点东西，这些都是从大船上带来、没被那些暴徒抢走的。然后，他向小船大声吩咐，命令他们把给总督的东西拿上岸。这礼物实在太丰盛了，好像我不会跟他们一起走，而是还要继续在岛上生活下去一样。首先，他给我带了一整箱高级的提神酒、六大瓶马德拉酒（每瓶有两夸脱）、两磅上好的茶叶、十二块上好的牛肉、六块猪肉、一袋豌豆，以及大约有一百磅的饼干。他还给我带了一箱糖、一箱面粉、一大袋柠檬、两瓶柠檬汁，还有许多其他的东西。比起这些来，对我更有用处的是六件干净的新衬衫、六条十分优质的领巾、两副手套、一双鞋、一顶帽子和一双长袜，还有一套他自己的西装，虽然有点磨损了，但只是一点点。总之，他是把我从头到脚都穿戴起来了。对于我这样处境的人来说，这真是一份友好而合适的礼物。但当我把这些东西刚穿戴起来时，却觉得世界上再没比这更让人不愉快、不舒服、不自在的了。当这些赠送仪式结束、船长送的东西都搬到我小小的住所之后，我们开始商量该怎么处置那些俘虏。这是个值得考虑的问题——我们能否冒险带着他们跟我们一起走，特别是那些人中最为冥顽不化、无可救药的两个。船长说他知道他们是不可饶恕的流氓，如果他真的带着他们一起离开的话，也要像对待犯人一样把他们用铁链锁起来，然后送给他能到达的第一个英国殖民地当局。我发现船长十分担心此事。于是我告诉他，如果他想这么做的话，我可以负责去说服，让他提到的那两个人自己要求他把他们留在这个岛上。“那最好不过了，”船长说，“我由衷赞同。”“那么，”我说，“我现在就把他们叫过来，替你跟他们谈谈。”于是我叫来星期五和那两个人质，这两人已经自由了，因为他们的同伙已经履行了自己的誓言。我让他们去山洞把那五个人带到我的乡间别墅去，还是绑着关押起来，等候我去处置。过了会儿，我就穿着新衣服去了，现在我又是总督了。和船长一起跟那边的人见过面后，我就叫人把那些人带来见我。我对他们说我已经详细了解了他们对船长的恶行，以及他们是如何偷走了大船并准备着进行更多抢劫的。好在上帝让他们自投罗网，最后他们掉进了自己为别人挖的陷阱里。我让他们知道在我的指挥下，大船已经被收复，现在正停在海口处；而他们不久就能看到他们的新船长被吊在桅杆上示众，那是他的罪行应得的报应。而对于他们，我倒是想知道他们还想说些什么，好让我不要像海盗当场被捕那样去处决他们。而就我的权限来看，他们不会怀疑我有权力这样做。</td>
		<td class="en">While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would not float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped,and were set down musing what we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board—but no boat stirred; and they fired several times, making other signals for the boat.At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out and row towards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they had firearms with them.As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place where the other had landed, and where the boat lay;by this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened;but that as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship’s crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us.I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost every condition that could be was better than that which we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance.I asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for?“And where, sir,” said I, “is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little while ago?For my part,” said I, “there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.”“What is that?” says he.“Why,” said I, “it is, that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew I should have thought God’s providence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands;for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us.”As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.We had, upon the first appearance of the boat’s coming from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured them effectually.Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they could have delivered themselves.Here they left them bound, but gave them provisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their escape they should be put to death without mercy.They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance.The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other two were taken into my service, upon the captain’s recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us;so with them and the three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering that the captain had said there were three or four honest men among them also.As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat.Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom.After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose.Then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring.But it was all one; those in the cave, we were sure, could not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them.They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the men were all murdered, and the longboat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board.The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, believing they would go on board the ship again and set sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the other way.They had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them all coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows.This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they would row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.However we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things might present.The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat.Those that came on shore kept close together, marching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us.We should have been very glad if they would have come nearer us, so that we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we might come abroad.But when they were come to the brow of the hill where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay towards the northeast part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat down together under a tree to consider it.Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had done the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was they had to fear.The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.I liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to them before they could load their pieces again.But this event did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute what course to take.At length I told them there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore.We waited a great while, though very impatient for their removing; and were very uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw them all start up and march down towards the sea;it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place that they resolved to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be as it really was that they had given over their search, and were going back again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it;but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a tittle.I ordered Friday and the captain’s mate to go over the little creek westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore, when Friday was rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising round, at about half a mile distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard them; they should return it again; and then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the woods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I directed them.They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed; and they presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore westward, towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the creek, where the water being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected.When they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of the three men out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the captain’s mate to their business, I took the rest with me; and, crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware—one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat.The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man.They needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.In the meantime, Friday and the captain’s mate so well managed their business with the rest that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where they were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came back to us.We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them.It was several hours after Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and we could hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster: which was very welcome news to us.At length they came up to the boat: but it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone.We could hear them call one to another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names a great many times; but no answer.After some time we could see them, by the little light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again.My men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing the others were very well armed.I resolved to wait, to see if they did not separate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly before they offered to fire.They had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them, with two more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this principal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them.The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next man was shot in the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it.At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant general; the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms.We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps might reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be very willing to capitulate.So he calls out as loud as he could to one of them, “Tom Smith! Tom Smith!”Tom Smith answered immediately, “Is that Robinson?” for it seems he knew the voice.The other answered, “Ay, ay; for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this moment.”“Who must we yield to?Where are they?” says Smith.“Here they are,” says he; “here’s our captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two hours; the boatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not yield you are all lost.”“Will they give us quarter, then?” says Tom Smith, “and we will yield.”“I’ll go and ask, if you promise to yield,” said Robinson: so he asked the captain, and the captain himself then calls out, “You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down your arms immediately and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins.”Upon this Will Atkins cried out, “For God’s sake, captain, give me quarter; what have I done?They have all been as bad as I:” which, by the way, was not true; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language.However, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor’s mercy: by which he meant me, for they all called me governor.In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which, with those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them, and upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons of state.Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship: and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives.As for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the commander’s of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct them that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman;that he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the morning.Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God’s sake, that they might not be sent to England.It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship;so I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to me; when I called, at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, “Captain, the commander calls for you;” and presently the captain replied, “Tell his excellency I am just coming.”This more perfectly amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was just by, with his fifty men.Upon the captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next morning.But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay.This was committed to Friday and the two men who came on shore with the captain.They conveyed them to the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men in their condition.The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full description: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were upon their behaviour.To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the ship.He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and that though the governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to England they would all be hanged in chains;but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the governor’s engagement for their pardon.Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a father to them as long as they lived.“Well,” says the captain, “I must go and tell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it.”So he brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out those five, and tell them, that they might see he did not want men, that he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore.This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in earnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty.Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the captain, his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms;third, the other two that I had kept till now in my bower, pinioned, but on the captain’s motion had now released; fourth, these five released at last; so that there were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on board the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with victuals.As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday was to take them.When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who told them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them; and that it was the governor’s pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me as governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them.He made his passenger captain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well, for they came up to the ship about midnight.As soon as they came within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they came to the ship’s side; when the captain and the mate entering first with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the butt end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men; they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below; when the other boat and their men, entering at the fore chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the cook room, making three men they found there prisoners.When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break into the roundhouse, where the new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands; and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody.The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the roundhouse, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till near two o’clock in the morning.Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of “Governor! Governor!” and presently I knew the captain’s voice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms, “My dear friend and deliverer,” says he, “there’s your ship; for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.”I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go.At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground.He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me.After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him.All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last it broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered my speech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together.I told him I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the eye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased.I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters had not plundered him of.Upon this, he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still.First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship’s beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a hundredweight of biscuit; he also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of limejuice, and abundance of other things.But besides these, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, six very good neck cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word, he clothed me from head to foot.It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances, but never was anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first.After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we might venture to take them with us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree;and the captain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come to; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about it.Upon this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them upon the island.“I should be very glad of that,” says the captain, “with all my heart.”“Well,” said I, “I will send for them up and talk with them for you.”So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came.After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called governor again.Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I told them I had got a full account of their villainous behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to commit further robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others.I let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see by-and-by that their new captain had received the reward of his villainy, and that they would see him hanging at the yard-arm;that, as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had authority so to do.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy.But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go to England;and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running away with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island.If they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they thought they could shift on shore.They seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged.So I left it on that issue.However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them there.Upon this I seemed a little angry with the captain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my word;and that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set them at liberty, as I found them: and if he did not like it he might take them again if he could catch them.Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave them some firearms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should live very well if they thought fit.Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day for me;ordering him, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.When the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.I told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain had carried them away they would certainly be hanged.I showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect.When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them I would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them.Accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.I told them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common with themselves.Here it may be noted that the captain, who had ink on board, was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done things much more difficult.I left them my firearms—viz. five muskets, three fowling pieces, and three swords.I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little, and wasted none.I gave them a description of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese.In a word, I gave them every part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of.Also, I gave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Having done all this I left them the next day, and went on board the ship.We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.The next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship’s side, and making the most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship for God’s sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them immediately.Upon this the captain pretended to have no power without me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some time after, soundly whipped and pickled; after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这件事后不久，海水涨潮了，我便让人用小船把我承诺给岛上人的东西运过去。此外，我代为求情，让他同意把那三人的箱子和衣物一起送去。岛上的三个人拿到东西后十分感激。我还鼓励他们，告诉他们如果以后我有能力派任何一条船只过来接他们，我一定不会忘了他们。</td>
		<td class="en">Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up, with the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very thankful for.I also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >离岛时，我把那顶自制的大羊皮帽、雨伞和一只鹦鹉带上了船，以作纪念。另外，我也没忘了带走我之前提到的那些钱。这些钱一直放在我身边久无用处，因此已经生锈或失去光泽了，要是不稍稍摩擦处理一下，几乎认不出是银币了。还有我从那条西班牙船只残骸上找到的那笔钱也是这样。就这样我离开了那个小岛。根据大船上的记事，我得知我是在一六八六年十二月十九日离开的，我在岛上呆了二十八年两个月零十九天。我第二次被困而得以逃脱的这一天，和我第一次从萨累的摩尔人手里坐长艇逃出来的那一天，是一个月的同一天。我乘坐这条船经过了一段长长的航行，终于在阔别三十五年后，于一六八七年六月十一日抵达英国。</td>
		<td class="en">When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the great goatskin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots;also, I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the ship’s account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered from this second captivity the same day of the month that I first made my escape in the longboat from among the Moors of Sallee.In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years absent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我重返英国时，对于所有的人已经完全是一个陌生人了，就像那里从来没人认识我一样。我的恩人，也是我忠实的管家现在还活着。当初我信任地将我的钱财交给了她保管。但是如今她过得很不幸，她再嫁后又成了寡妇，在这个世界上卑微地活着。</td>
		<td class="en">When I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as if I had never been known there.My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very low in the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于她欠我的钱，我让她完全放心，保证不会找她麻烦。但是相反的，为了感谢她此前对我的照顾和忠诚，我用我微薄的积蓄尽可能给了她一点接济。那时，我的积蓄允许我为她做的的确很少。但是我向她保证我不会忘记以前她对我的好，一旦我有足够能力帮助她我一定会记得她。不过这是后话了。后来我南下去了约克郡，我的父亲已经去世了，我的母亲和全家也都已经不在了。我只找到了两个妹妹，以及一个哥哥的两个孩子。因为很久以前我就被认为已死，所以没有遗产留给我。所以，一句话，我找不到什么来接济或者援助我。而我身上的那点儿钱根本不够我在这个世界上立足。不过我的确遇到了一份感激，这是我没有预料到的。是这样的，因为我好心地救了船长，且同样拯救了那条船和整船的货物，船长便向那些船主们极其绘声绘色地讲述了我是如何拯救了船员们的生命和那条大船。于是他们邀请我去跟他们以及另外一些相关的商人见面。那些人因此而对我大为赞扬，并给了我大约两百英镑作为见面礼。</td>
		<td class="en">I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would afford;which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do but little for her; but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness to me; nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be observed in its proper place.I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers;and as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the world.I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very handsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men and the ship,they invited me to meet them and some other merchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost 200 pounds sterling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，对生活现状考虑再三之后，我觉得这样下去实在是难以安身，于是决定去里斯本一趟，去看看我会不会得到巴西种植园以及我的合伙人的消息。我有理由相信，我的合伙人很多年前就以为我死了。</td>
		<td class="en">But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some information of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over for dead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >带着这个想法我便乘船去了里斯本，于次年四月到达。我的仆人星期五在整个奔走的过程中都一直非常忠心耿耿地陪伴着我，在任何时候都是我最忠实的仆人。到了里斯本，通过一番打听，我十分欣慰地找到了我的老朋友，那位在远离非洲海岸的海面上第一个将我救起的船长。他现在年事已高，不再出海，而是让他已人到中年的儿子当了船长，并仍然在做巴西贸易。这位老人已经不认得我了，而我确实也几乎认不出他来。但我很快想起了他，而在我告诉他我是谁之后，他也很快记起了我。</td>
		<td class="en">With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April following, my man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions.When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship who first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa.He was now grown old, and had left off going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.The old man did not know me, and indeed I hardly knew him.But I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him who I was.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老友重逢自然少不了一番热情的寒暄，接着我就问了我的种植园和合伙人的情况。老人告诉我说他大约有九年没去巴西了，但他可以向我保证的是当他离开的时候我的合伙人还活着。但是我当初委托与合伙人一起照顾我的产业的两位代理人都已经去世了，但是他相信我能得到一份非常详细的种植园这些年来改进发展的报告。因为基于我已遇难溺水的普遍看法，我的代理人就把我在种植园应得的收益报告呈交税务官。税务官拨出该财产的三分之一给国王，以防我永远不回来接受这笔财产，另三分之二给圣奥古斯丁修道院，用以救济穷人和在印第安人之间传播天主教。但如果我出现了，或有人替我认领这笔遗产，财产便还是可以收回的。只是那些已经被分配给慈善事业用途的增值部分或历年收入是无法收回的。但老人向我保证说，政府征收土地税的官员和修道院的管理人员一直在非常注意监督当事人，也就是我的合伙人，确保他每年给出一份详实的收益账目，好让他们按时收取我应得的份额。我问老人是否知道我的合伙人让种植园发展到什么程度了，他认为还值不值得继续经营；或者，如果我去巴西想把我应得的部分收回的话，是否会有困难。他告诉我他不能准确地说出种植园现在发展到什么程度了，但他知道这一点，那就是我的合伙人仅靠他的那部分收入，已经是非常富有了。老人还回忆起，他曾听说国王得到的我那部分的三分之一，每年达两百多葡萄牙金币，似乎都拨给另一个修道院，还是什么宗教机构了。至于要顺利收回这笔财产，应该没有问题。我的合伙人还活着，可以证明我的股权，而且我的名字在巴西也记录在册。他还告诉我，我的两位代理人的后人都是非常公正而诚实的人，并且很富有。他相信我不仅在收回财产时能得到他们的帮助，还能从他们那里得到一大笔属于我的现款，那是他们的父亲在受我委托期间的种植园的收入，那时这些钱还没像我之前说的那样充公。据他回忆，把我的财产充公，大概有十二年了。</td>
		<td class="en">After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner.The old man told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but that he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living, but the trustees whom I had joined with him to take cognisance of my part were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very good account of the improvement of the plantation;for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one third to the king, and two thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be restored;only that the improvement, or annual production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured me that the steward of the king’s revenue from lands, and the providore,or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along that the incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of which they had duly received my moiety.I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had brought the plantation and whether he thought it might be worth looking after; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety.He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but this he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it;and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the king’s third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to above two hundred moidores a year:that as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of the country; also he told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy;and he believed I would not only have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as above; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听了他的话，我显得有些担忧和不安。我问老船长，既然他知道我已经立了遗嘱，让他这位葡萄牙船长作为我财产的全权继承人，那两位代理人还这样处理我的财产是怎么回事。</td>
		<td class="en">I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老人说我说的没错，但当时并没有证据证明我死了。在没有关于我死亡的确定报告到来前，他不能担当遗嘱执行人，并且他也不想插手在那么远的地方发生的事。他确实已登记了我的遗嘱，并且提出了继承要求。如果他能给出任何我是生是死的证据，他大概早已按照财产委托权接管了我的糖厂，并让他现在正在巴西做生意的儿子去管理了。“但是，”老人说，“我有件事要告诉你，你大概会不太乐意接受。那就是，当时我们以为你死了，大家也都这样认为，你的合伙人和代理人就把起初六七年里你的收入给了我，我也收下了。当时种植园发展还需要很多花费，像添设备、建糖厂、买奴隶什么的，那些年的收入也就没有后来多，但是，”老人又说，“我会给你一份我收进份额的真实账目，并告诉你我是如何处置它们的。”我又跟这位老朋友谈了几天后，他给了我一份种植园前六年收入的账单，上面有我的合伙人和代理人的签名。当时交易的是现货，有成捆的烟草，成箱的糖等，另外还有甜酒和糖浆之类，那都是糖厂的产品。我还从这份账单中发现，每年收入都有很大提升。只是因为前面说的，当时种植园花销大，实际收入起初不多。但老人还是告诉我他欠我四百七十块葡萄牙金币，以及六箱糖和十五捆双烟草卷，这些东西在一次航行中损失了。那次他的船只在回里斯本的航行中失事了，那时距我离开巴西有十一年了。这位好心的老人接着开始讲述他的不幸遭遇，以及他是怎样不得已才动用我的钱财去补偿损失，并在一条新船上买了股份。“不过，我的老朋友，”他说，“你是不会缺钱花的，等我儿子回来后，我就能把钱还你了。”说着，他拿出一只旧钱袋，给了我一百六十块葡萄牙金币，又把他在船上投的股份开了条给我。他的儿子正是开着这条船去巴西的，他和他儿子各占了四分之一的股份。老人把这两样东西都交到我手中，作为其余欠款的担保。</td>
		<td class="en">He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being dead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should come of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim;and could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so they call the sugarhouse), and have given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it.“But,” says the old man, “I have one piece of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account with me, in your name, for the first six or eight years’ profits, which I received.There being at that time great disbursements for increasing the works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced; however,” says the old man, “I shall give you a true account of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it.”After a few days’ further conference with this ancient friend, he brought me an account of the first six years’ income of my plantation, signed by my partner and the merchant trustees, being always delivered in goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, which is the consequence of a sugar work;and I found by this account, that every year the income considerably increased; but, as above, the disbursements being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my having the place.The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship.“However, my old friend,” says he, “you shall not want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son returns you shall be fully satisfied.”Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and giving the writings of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter part owner, and his son another, he puts them both into my hands for security of the rest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我被这个可怜老人的诚实和善良深深打动，不忍再听他说下去了。我想起他为我所做的一切，想到他是如何把我从海里救出，如何一直待我慷慨大度，特别是他现在对我来说是一个多么真挚的朋友。听了他的话，我几乎忍不住流下了眼泪。于是我问他，以他的现况一下子拿出这么多钱会不会有问题，会不会使他生活拮据？他对我说，拮据当然会有一点，但那是我的钱，而且我现在比他更需要这笔钱。这个善良的老人说的每一句话都充满真情，我听着他的话便不禁流泪了。简单说，我拿了他一百块葡萄牙金币，又要了笔和墨水写了张收据给他。然后，我把剩余的钱还给了老人，并对他说如果我能收回种植园，我会把这一百块金币也还给他（我后来也确实这么做了）。至于那张他要让出在他儿子船上的股份的证明，我是无论如何不能收的。如果我还需要钱，我一定会来找他，因为他那么诚实善良，但是，如果我不再缺钱，并且收回了那个他相信我能收回的种植园，我是不会再拿他一分钱的。这些事情办完后，老人又问我要不要他替我想个办法，帮我要回种植园。我对他说这件事我想亲自来办。他说如果我想这样的话也可以，但如果我需要帮助的话，有很多方法可以保证我的权益，让我的财产立刻归我使用。由于里斯本的河里正有船要去往巴西，老人就让我在官方登记了我的姓名，他也写了担保书，宣誓证明我还活着，并声明我正是那个在巴西领取了土地建立种植园的人。老人的担保由一位公证人例行做了公证，并附上了一份委托书。他又写了一封亲笔信，让我带给他在巴西做商人的一位熟人。然后他让我在他家中住下，等待回信。这次的手续真是再公正不过了。不到七个月，我就收到了我的代理人那从商的后人寄给我的一个大包裹（需要说明的是，我正是由于那些代理人才出海遇难的）。包裹里附有以下信件和说明：第一，有我种植园收益的流水账，是从他们的父亲和我的葡萄牙老船长结算那年开始记的，一共六年。余额算下来，他们一共该给我一千一百七十四块葡萄牙金币。第二，还有另外四年的账单，是在政府接管前、种植园收益仍归代理人所有时的，这段时间里他们认为我失踪，称为“法律上的死亡”。这段时间里种植园的收益有所增长，一共有一万九千四百四十六块葡萄牙银币，大概相当于三千两百四十块金币。第三，还有圣奥古斯丁修道院院长的账单，记录十四年来的收益。除了已经无法计算的用于医院方面的数目，院长诚实地说明了他还存有八百七十二块葡萄牙金币，现在也都归我所有。至于国王的那部分，则无法偿还了。此外，还有一封合伙人写给我的信，他十分真挚地庆祝了我的生还，并说明了我们的种植园的增产情况及每年的产量。他详细说明了现在我们一共有多少英亩土地，以及是如何种植的，有多少奴隶。他还在信纸上画了二十二个十字架表示祝福，告诉我他说了无数遍“万福玛利亚”开头的祷词，感激圣母玛利亚让我仍活在世间。他热情地邀请我去巴西收回自己的财产，并说如果我不过去的话，就告诉他应该把财产交给什么人。在信的末尾，他表达了自己和家人对我的深切情谊。另外，他还给了我七张上好的豹皮作为礼物。这好像是他派出去的另一条从非洲带回来的，而他们那次航行比我幸运多了。除了豹皮，他还送了我五箱上等蜜饯和和一百枚没有铸过的金币，这些金币没葡萄牙金币那么大。这支船队还给我带来了我的代理人给我的一千两百箱糖和八百捆烟草，还有我账上所剩的全部财产所折合成的黄金。我现在真的可以说，上帝后来赐给约伯的福分要比先前的多得多。当我得知我的全部财产都已经回到了我身边时，内心的激动之情简直难以言表。从巴西来的船只都是结队而来的，这支船队给我带来了信件，也带来了我的货物。在那些信抵达我手之前，我的财产就已安全抵达那条河了。总之，这一切使我激动得脸色发白，身体虚弱。要不是老人给我拿了点提神酒，我想这惊喜一定会让我精神失常、当场死掉。不仅如此，之后的好几个小时里我还是一直非常虚弱，直到请来一位医生。他弄清了我不舒服的真正原因，给我放了血，这样我才放松下来，开始好转。我还是相信，如果我不是用这样一种方式发泄一下的话，大概早就死掉了。突然之间，我就成了五千多英镑的所有者，而且,或许我可以这样说，我在巴西还有一份产业，每年能收入一千英镑以上，就像在英国的田产一样可靠。总之，我现在出于一种我自己也无法搞明白的状况之中，我简直不知道该如何享用这笔财富。我做的第一件事就是回报我最初的恩人，我善良的老船长。他在我最初遇难时对我十分仁慈，后来又始终真挚而善良地对待我。我给他看了所有寄给我的东西，并对他说，我得能到所有这些，除了上天的安排外，全是靠他的帮助。现在，是我该报答他的时候了，我要百倍地回报他。于是我首先把那一百块葡萄牙金币还给了他。然后又找来一位公证人，让他起草了一份字据，以最彻底、最可靠的方式，撤销了老船长所说的欠我的四百七十块葡萄牙金币。然后，我又让他起草了一份委托书，让老船长替我代管种植园的年收益，并让我的合伙人向他汇报账目，把我应得的收入让经常在巴西和里斯本间来往的船队带给他。在委托书的最后，还列出一项，就是老船长的有生之年，我要保证每年从我的收入中给他一百块葡萄牙金币；老船长辞世后，则在他儿子的有生之年每年给他五十块。我想以这样的方式来报答这位老人家。现在我该考虑接下来我该何去何从了，以及如何安排上帝为我带来的这笔财富。事实上，比起之前在岛上的生活，现在我需要考虑更多了。在岛上时，除了我现有的，我就别无他求；除了我需要的，我也一无所有。但是现在情况发生了巨大的变化，我需要保护好我的财产。现在不像在岛上，我没有洞穴可以藏匿我的钱币，也没有什么地方可以放置它们而不用上锁，让它们在那里发霉和生锈而不会被人发现。相反，我根本不知道该将它们安置在何处，也不知道有谁可以信任地把钱交给他保管。只有我的老船长，我的保护人，那么诚实善良，是我唯一可以信赖的人了。另一方面，我在巴西的利益似乎在召唤着我去往彼岸，但我在考虑去那边之前，得先把我这边的事宜安排好，并把财产交给某个可靠的人管理。开始我想到了我的老朋友，也就是那个寡妇，我知道她很诚实，也一定会待我公正。但是她年纪大了，又很穷，而且据我所知还欠了债。总之一句话，我别无选择，只能带着我的财产亲自回英国了。然而，等我安排好这一切时，已经过了几个月了。现在我已经尽全力报答了那位老船长，而我的这位恩人也很满意。于是现在我开始考虑如何报答那位可怜的寡妇，她的丈夫是我的第一位恩人，而她也曾是我忠实的管家和我的指导者。所以接下来我做的第一件事，就是让一位在里斯本的商人写信给他在伦敦的联系人，让他把我的支票兑成现款，并帮我找到那位寡妇，从我这拿一百英镑给她，并跟她谈一谈，安慰一下现在处境贫困的她，告诉她她将在我的有生之年得到进一步的补偿。同时我又给我在乡下的两个妹妹每人寄去一百英镑，她们虽然不是很缺钱，但境况也不是很好。这两个妹妹，其中一个结了婚，现在成了寡妇，而另一个的丈夫对她也不是很好。但在我所有的亲戚朋友中，我挑不出一个我能放心交付所有财产的人，能在我去巴西的时候替我看管好一切。这让我十分为难。</td>
		<td class="en">I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to be able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me;therefore I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that time, and if it would not straiten him?He told me he could not say but it might straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might want it more than he.Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:then I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards did);and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son’s ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a penny more from him.When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a method to make my claim to my plantation.I told him I thought to go over to it myself.He said I might do so if I pleased, but that if I did not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use:and as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the planting the said plantation at first.This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the return.Never was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went to sea, in which were the following, particular letters and papers enclosed:— First, there was the account current of the produce of my farm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while they kept the effects in their hands, before the government claimed the administration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which they called civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores.Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine’s account, which had received the profits for above fourteen years; but not being able to account for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my account: as to the king’s part, that refunded nothing.There was a letter of my partner’s, congratulating me very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved, and what it produced a year;with the particulars of the number of squares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it: and making two and twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many AVE MARIAS to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive;inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of my own, and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects if I did not come myself;concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family; and sent me as a present seven fine leopards’ skins, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I.He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores.By the same fleet my two merchant trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold.I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than the beginning.It is impossible to express the flutterings of my very heart when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods: and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my hand.In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the spot;nay, after that I continued very ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause of my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well: but I verify believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died.I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in England:and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it.The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the end.I showed him all that was sent to me; I told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundredfold: so I first returned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge from the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner possible.After which I caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of the annual profits of my plantation: and appointing my partner to account with him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name;and by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life: and thus I requited my old man.I had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands;and, indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in my state of life in the island where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my business was how to secure it.I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it; on the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it.My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me.At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt: so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to England myself and take my effects with me.It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor.So, the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply:at the same time I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one having been married and left a widow; and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be.But among all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我曾经想过去巴西并在那里定居，因为我曾有过巴西户籍。但我对于宗教问题有点顾虑，所以总是犹豫不决。而现在，我却不是因为宗教原因而不去巴西。因为之前在巴西的时候，我已经毫无顾忌地接受了他们的宗教，所以现在已经无所谓了。只是，我最近时常深入考虑这个问题，想到要和巴西人一起生活，然后在他们之中死去，我开始后悔当初加入了天主教，觉得以这样的身份死去并非最佳的选择。但是，就像我前面已经说过的，这并非是阻止我去巴西的主要原因，实在是因为我不知道要把财产托付给谁。所以，最终我决定回到英国，到那里以后再看看能不能找到一些熟人或亲戚，能忠诚于我。于是，我开始准备带着所有的财富回到英国。为了给回国作准备，我得先写几封信得体地回复一下从巴西寄来的那些详实的账目（那支巴西来的船队就要离开了）。首先，对于圣奥古斯丁修道院的院长，我写了一封信，充分感激了他公正的处事方式，另外又把我那尚未动用的八百七十二块葡萄牙金币捐了出去，我说我希望把五百块金币捐给修道院，另三百七十二块给穷人，这些都随院长的安排，并请这位好心的神父为我祈祷等诸如此类。然后，我又给我的两位代理人写了封感谢信，衷心感谢了他们的公正和诚实。至于寄礼物给他们，他们实在是什么也用不上。最后，我写了信给我的合伙人，感谢他辛勤劳作发展种植园，以及他在扩大工厂股份中的正直无私。我在信中告诉了他今后如何管理我那部分，请他按照我赋予老船长的权利，寄给他所有我应得的收益，直到我给他更确切的指示。我还向合伙人保证，我不仅想去那里看望他，还想去那里定居，度过余生。在这封信里我附上了一份很棒的礼物给他的妻子和两个女儿，因为老船长的儿子告诉我他已经有了家室。礼物中有一些意大利丝绸，两匹上好的英国细呢，这是我在里斯本买到的最好的呢料。另外还有五匹黑色粗呢和一些昂贵的弗兰德斯蕾丝花边。这些都办妥后，我卖掉了我的货物，又把所有的钱财换成了可信的汇票，接下来的一个难题就是该走哪条路回英国了。我最习惯的莫过于航海，但那次不知道为什么，我对坐船有种莫名的憎恶。这种想法越来越强烈，以至大概有两三次，我已经把行李搬上船想要走了，却还是改变了主意。没错，我的航海生涯确实很不糟糕，但这应该不是我不想坐船的原因。但不管怎样，没人会在这时忽略他自己内心的如此强烈的想法。我曾特地挑出了两条船，想乘坐它们出发，一条我已经把行李搬上去了，另一条是已经跟船长说好了的，但后来都没上，结果这两条船果然出事了。一条被阿尔及利亚人劫持了，而另一条在托贝湾的斯塔特岬角沉没了，船上只有三个人生还，其他人都溺水而亡了。所以我无论上了哪条船，都会很倒霉。我的思绪就这样一直纠结着，我跟老船长讲了所有这些烦心事，他便坚决让我别再坐船。他说我可以走陆路到拉科鲁尼亚，然后穿过比斯开湾到罗谢尔，再从那里去走陆路去巴黎，这样既舒适又安全，就这样走到加来和多佛尔。或者我可以向北走到马德里，再全程走陆路穿过法国。总之，我不走海路的想法已先入为主，除了从加来到多佛尔，我决定全程都走陆路。反正我不急着赶路，也不在乎花费，相较而言陆路是更惬意的选择。而为了使我的旅行更愉快，老船长替我找了一位乐意陪我一块走的英国绅士，他的父亲在里斯本经商。后来我们又顺便带上了两个英国商人，和两个年亲的葡萄牙绅士，不过这两个葡萄牙人只是要去巴黎。这样一来，我们一共有六个人再加上五个仆人。那两个商人和两个葡萄牙人愿意两两共用一个仆人，以节省开支。而我除了星期五外，又找了一个英国水手当仆人。因为星期五作为一个十足的外来人，实在不知道在这旅行中如何当好一个仆人。就这样我从里斯本出发了。我们这一行人骑着马，全副武装，就像一支小军队，大家赋予我队长的光荣称号，一来因为我年纪最大，二来因为我有两个仆人。况且，我的确是这次整个旅行的发起人。此前，我没有用我的航海日记来烦扰大家，那么现在，我也不会用我此次的陆上日记来烦扰大家。但是，在这次漫长乏味而艰难的旅行中我们所遇到的一些险事，我一定不能遗漏。当我们到达马德里时，由于我们都不曾到过西班牙，就想在这里呆上一段时间，看看西班牙的皇宫和其他一些值得参观的地方，但那时已经是夏末，我们匆匆离开，从马德里出发时已是十月中旬了。但是，当我们到达纳瓦尔边境时，听到沿途好几个镇上的人说起法国境内的山上正下着大雪，而有几个试图冒着极大危险翻山的旅客，都被迫返回了潘佩卢那，这使我们很是担忧。当我们到达潘佩卢那当地的时候，发现的确如此。对于我来说，已经习惯了热带气候，相比在那些几乎热得穿不上衣服的国家，这里的寒冷实在叫我无法忍受。尤其是我们十天前才离开旧卡斯蒂利亚，那里的天气不仅温暖，甚至是很热了。所以现在突然感受到从比利牛斯山上吹来的如此刺骨、凛冽的寒风，自然是痛苦大于惊奇，这真实让人无法忍受，简直要把我们的手指和脚趾都冻麻毁掉了。当可怜的星期五看到那些山完全被雪覆盖并感受到寒冷的天气时，这可怜的人真的给吓坏了。这是他一生中根本前所未见、从未感受过的。更糟的是，当我们到达潘佩卢那后，暴雪就一直持续下着，那么强烈和漫长。那里的人说今年冬天来早了，而路原本就不好走，现在更是完全无法通行了。简单说，有些地方雪很深，使我们很难行走。这里的雪不像北方一些国家会冻得硬硬的，每走一步都会有被活埋的危险。我们在潘佩卢那耽搁了不下二十天。（眼看着冬天就要到来，而天气完全没有好转的可能了，因为这是人们记忆中全欧洲最严酷的冬天了。）于是我提议我们先去往封塔拉比亚，然后从那里坐船去波尔多，这段航程很近。但是当我考虑这个问题的时候，来了四位法国绅士。他们曾在关口被阻在法国境内，就像我们被阻在西班牙境内一样。不过他们后来找到了一个向导，带他们绕过朗格多克岬角附近的山区，这样一路翻山过来都没怎么被大雪阻挡。而在遇到雪的地方，他们说也冻得很硬，人和马走都没有问题。于是我们找来了这位向导，他说他会带我们走同一条路，这样就不用担心大雪的危害了。不过我们得带上足够的武器，以保护自己不受野兽侵袭。因为他说，大雪过后，在山脚下常常有狼出没，遍地大雪使它们找不到食物，因而十分贪婪。我们对他说我们足以应付这样的野兽，只要他保证我们不会遇到一种两条腿的狼。因为我们听说这种狼才会对我们构成最大的威胁，尤其是在法国境内的山上。他保证说我们走的那条路上不会有这样的危险，所以我们便欣然同意跟他走。此外，还有十二位绅士和他们的仆人，有的是法国人，有的是西班牙人，他们就是我前面说的，试图翻越过境而被迫返回的那些人。</td>
		<td class="en">I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but I had some little scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me back.However, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the present; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of the country all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet;only that, now and then, having of late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret having professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best religion to die with.But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my effects behind me;so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if I arrived, I concluded that I should make some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to go to England with all my wealth.In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet being just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from thence;and, first, to the Prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were undisposed of, which I desired might be given,five hundred to the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct; desiring the good padre’s prayers for me, and the like.I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for sending them any present, they were far above having any occasion of it.Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of the works;giving him instructions for his future government of my part, according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from me more particularly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life.To this I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for such the captain’s son informed me he had; with two pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good value.Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go to England:I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to England by the sea at that time, and yet I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once but two or three times.It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of the reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment:two of the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other, having put my things on board one of them, and in the other having agreed with the captain; I say two of these ships miscarried.One was taken by the Algerines, and the other was lost on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned except three; so that in either of those vessels I had been made miserable.Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land through France.In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way:and to make it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked up two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only;so that in all there were six of us and five servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese, contenting themselves with one servant between two, to save the charge;and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant on the road.In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole journey.As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble you now with none of my land journals; but some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth observing; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October;but when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was falling on the French side of the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable;nor, indeed, was it more painful than surprising to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes.Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in his life.To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it continued snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people said winter was come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult before, were now quite impassable;for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every step.We stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had been known in the memory of man) I proposed that we should go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage.But, while I was considering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow;for where they met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses.We sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, in these great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow.We told him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger from, especially on the French side of the mountains.He satisfied us that there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，我们在十一月十五日那天跟着向导从潘佩卢那出发了。他不是带着我们向前走，而是沿着我们从马德里来的原路往回走了大约二十英里，这的确让我感到惊讶。过了两条河后，我们来到了平原地带，这里又是很温暖的气候了，风景怡人，一点儿雪也看不见。但是向导又突然左转，从另一条路走近了山区。虽然这低山丘陵、悬崖峭壁看起来的确可怕，但向导七拐八拐，绕来绕去，带着我们经过许多曲折蜿蜒的路，竟然就这样让我们不知不觉地翻过了最高的山头，而根本没遇到什么大雪阻碍。然后，突然他让我们看那美丽富饶的朗格多克省和加斯科尼省。那里一片绿意盎然，欣欣向荣，但距离很远，我们还得走过一段崎岖的山路才能到那里。</td>
		<td class="en">Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the 15th of November; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going forward, he came directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles;when, having passed two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he approached the mountains another way;and though it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much encumbered with the snow;and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and flourishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass still.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，突然下起了大雪，一下就是一天一夜，我们没法再继续前进了。这时，我们感到有点儿不安，但向导让我们放心，说我们很快就能通过这里。而事实上，我们也发现我们正在一天天地下山，比之前更靠北了。就这样，我们依靠向导继续前进。</td>
		<td class="en">We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we should soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come more north than before; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大概离天黑还有两个小时的时候，向导走在前面，离我们有段距离，正好看不见了。这时，从靠近密林的山沟里，突然蹿出三条大狼，后面还跟着一只熊。其中两只狼向向导扑去，如果他距我们很远的话，大概早就被狼吞掉了，我们根本来不及救他。那两条狼其中一只咬住他的马，另一只凶残地向他扑过去，向导根本来不及，也不够镇定去掏手枪，而只是拼命地冲我们大喊大叫。我的仆人星期五就在我身边，我让他骑马去看看到底发生了什么事。星期五一看到那个向导，就像向导一样大叫起来：“哦，主人！哦，主人！”但像一个勇敢的人一般，星期五策马径直冲向那个可怜的人，一枪射在袭击向导的那条狼的头上。</td>
		<td class="en">It was about two hours before night when, our guide being something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two of the wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he would have been devoured before we could have helped him;one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such violence, that he had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.My man Friday being next me, I bade him ride up and see what the matter was.As soon as Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, “O master! O master!”But like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那可怜的人应该庆幸去的人是我的仆人星期五，因为他在自己的国家早已见惯了这样的野兽，根本毫不畏惧；他走到近前，一下打死了狼。要是换成我们中的其他人，大概只敢远远地开上一枪，或许会射不到狼，或者误伤向导。</td>
		<td class="en">It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would have fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那情景足以使比我胆大的人也觉得恐怖。而事实上，伴随着星期五的枪声，我们听到两边都是狼最凄惨的叫声，我们一行人恐慌不已。那叫声在山里回荡着，听起来像是有无数条狼一起在嚎叫。而说不定真的不止这么几条狼，要不，我们也不用如此惊慌。但是，因为星期五干掉了这条狼，另一条紧咬着马不放的狼也立刻松开口逃走了。幸运的是，那条狼只咬住了马的头，而且被马勒上的铁钉卡住了牙齿，因此并没有伤到马。但向导伤得很重，因为那条狂暴的野兽咬了他两次，第一次在胳臂上，第二次在他膝盖靠上一点儿的地方。虽然他有所反抗，但星期五上前开枪时，他刚好从那匹受惊的马上摔了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday’s pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious number of them;and perhaps there was not such a few as that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth.But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and though he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不用猜，听到星期五的枪声，我们便加快了步伐，尽管路不好走，我们还是奋力策马赶上前去一探究竟。我们一转出之前挡住视线的小树林，就清楚地看到了发生了什么。我们看到了星期五是如何解救了那位可怜的向导，但当时还不能辨认他打死了什么野兽。</td>
		<td class="en">It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday’s pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter.As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.</td></tr>

>不过，没有一场搏斗能够像之后星期五和大熊之间进行得那样艰难，那样令人惊奇。不过虽然我们所有人一开始都为星期五担心，心惊胆战的，但后来却让我们都收获了可以想象的最大的快乐。因为熊是一种笨重、笨拙的动物，奔跑起来不像狼那么敏捷轻盈，所以它有两个特点，这通常也是它的行动规则：第一，它一般并不把人类当作专门的捕食对象。（它通常不会攻击人类，除非人类首先攻击它，或者是在它饿极的时候。现在可能就是后一种情况，因为地面覆盖着雪。）如果你不惹它的话，它便不会来惹你。不过你要注意得对它非常客气，并给它让路，因为熊是一位特别挑剔的绅士，它不会为王子让一步路。而且如果你真的害怕的话，最好的方法就是看另一个方向，继续走你的路。因为有时如果你停下，站着不动，还一直盯着它看的话，熊就会认为这是对它的冒犯。而如果你向它扔或抛什么东西的话，即使只是一根手指那么粗的小树枝，它也会觉得自己被侵犯了。于是它会把所有其他事情都放下，过来复仇，一定要维护了自己的荣誉才肯罢休。这便是它的第一个特点。它的第二个特点是：一旦它被冒犯了，它就会日夜不离地跟着你，不惜绕许多路也要赶上你，直到报了仇才肯罢休。我的仆人星期五已经救出了向导，当我们走到他身边的时候，他正在帮那个向导下马。向导受了伤，被吓坏了。就在这时，突然我们看到那只熊从树林里出来了。这只熊十分巨大，是我目前见过的最大的一只。见到它，我们大家都有点惊慌，但是星期五看到它时，这个小伙子脸上的欣喜和英勇显而易见。“哦！哦！哦！”星期五一连喊了三声，指着大熊说：“哦，主人，您给我许可。我要去跟它握握手，我会让你们开怀大笑的。”看到这家伙这么开心，我很惊讶。“你这个笨蛋，”我说，“它会吃掉你的。”——“吃掉我！吃掉我！”星期五一连说了两遍，然后又说：“是我要吃掉它，我会让你们开怀大笑的。你们就都呆在这里，我来给你们找点儿乐子。”于是，他坐下来，很快地脱下靴子，换上了一双便鞋。（我们都这样叫他们穿的那种平底鞋，星期五把这鞋装在口袋里。）他把他的马交给了我的另一个仆人，然后就带着枪，像一阵风一样快速飞奔而去。那只大熊正在安静地继续走着，并没有想攻击任何人。星期五来到了离熊很近的地方，冲它叫喊着，似乎这熊能听懂似的。“听着，听着，”星期五说，“我在跟你说话呢！”我们远远地跟着。现在我们正在下山，来到了山这边的加斯科尼。我们进入了一片大森林，虽然它的里面到处都是树木，但土地十分平坦开阔。星期五，就像我们说的那样，很快地追上了那只熊，捡起一块大石头，向它扔去，正好打在它的头上，但是并没有造成任何伤害，就像是扔在了一堵墙上一样。可是这样一来，星期五的目的就达到了。这个家伙根本不害怕，他这样做纯粹就是为了让那只熊跟着他，然后就如他所说的那样让我们开怀大笑。那只熊感到有人打它，还看到了星期五，便立刻就转身向他追来。它迈着大步，拖着身体，以不可思议的速度追赶着，可以让一匹马以中等速度飞跑起来。星期五择路撒腿就跑，好像是往我们这边来寻求帮助似的。于是我们都决定立刻向那只熊开枪，救出我的仆人。但我心里很生气，因为熊本来要走另一条路干自己的事，是他把熊带回到我们这里来，尤其让我生气的是，他把熊引到我们面前自己却跑掉了。于是我大声喊道：“你这个混蛋！这就是你说的让我们开怀大笑吗？快过来骑上你的马，我们好开枪打死这畜生。”星期五听到了我的话，大叫：“别开枪，别开枪。站着别动，你们一定会很开心的。”星期五身手矫健，他跑两步那只熊才能跑一步。突然，他转身跑到我们的一边，看到一棵大橡树正合他意，就招手让我们跟上去。星期五的步伐加快了一倍，敏捷地爬上了树，把枪放在离树的底部大约五六码的地上。大熊很快就来到了树跟前，而我们还离了一段距离。它做的第一件事是在枪前停了下来，闻了闻，没有动它，然后便开始向上爬树。虽然它那么庞大又笨重，爬起来却像只猫一样。我觉得星期五的行为太荒唐了，让我惊诧，根本看不出有什么好笑的地方。等看到大熊已经爬上了树，我们就都骑马靠近了他。当我们都来到树下时，星期五已经走到了一根大树枝的末梢的地方，那只大熊大概也爬到了距他一半距离的地方。当那只熊来到那根树枝较易弯的部分时，星期五冲着我们说“哈！现在让你们看看我教熊跳舞。”于是他开始在那根树枝上又跳又摇，那只熊被弄得摇摇欲坠，只好站住不动，开始回头看自己的身后，看该怎么回去。这时，我们确实都开怀大笑起来。但星期五还远远没跟它玩够呢。看到它站住不动了，他又冲着它大喊起来，好像他认为熊能说英语一样：“怎么了，你不往前走了？请你再往前走一些吧。”于是他停止了在树枝上跳动和摇晃。而那只熊就好像听得懂他的话，真的又往前走了一点儿。然后星期五又开始蹦跳，于是那熊又停住了。我们觉得现在正是击中那只熊头部的好时机，于是就喊向星期五让他站着别动了，好让我们射杀那只熊，但星期五却很认真地喊道：“哦，不要！哦，不要！不要开枪，我下会儿就开枪。”其实他应该说“等会儿”。不过，长话短说了。星期五跳得很厉害，那只熊站得东倒西歪的。我们笑够了，但还是想不出星期五那家伙要干什么。一开始我们以为他想把熊摇下来，但是我们发现那只熊很狡猾，根本不会上当。因为它根本不肯在树上走太远，生怕被摇下来，而只是用它宽大的爪子和脚掌紧紧地抓住树枝。所以我们无法想象最后的结局，也不知道这个玩笑会如何收场。不过星期五很快就打消了我们的疑虑。因为看到那只熊紧紧地抱着树枝，无法说服它再往前走一步。“好吧，好吧，”星期五说，“你别再往前走了，我走；你不到我这来，我可到你那里去啦。”说着他爬到了树梢，树枝被他的体重压弯，星期五轻轻地让自己随着树枝垂下，从树枝上面滑了下来，直到离地面足够近了，他就跳了下来，然后向枪跑去，把枪拿了起来，一动不动地站着。“那么，”我对他说，“星期五，你现在要干什么？为什么不开枪打死它？”“不开枪，”星期五说，“现在不。我现在开枪，我不杀它。我呆在这里，再让你们笑一下。”他确实也做到了。因为当那只熊看到它的敌人走了，它便从它站着的树枝上往回走。但它走得非常小心，每一步都要看看身后，往回走直到退到了大树干。然后它还是倒着身子，用爪子抓着树干，开始下树。它每次只移动一只脚掌，非常慢。就在那只熊的后腿刚要落地前的那一瞬间，星期五一下子冲到它跟前，把枪口塞进熊的耳朵里，打死了它。然后那家伙转过身来看我们笑了没有。当他看到我们都喜形于色，自己也开始大声笑起来。“在我的家乡就是这么猎熊的。”星期五说。“像这样猎熊？”我问，“呃，你们并没有枪啊。”——“是没有，”他说，“没有枪，但我们是用很长的箭。”这件事对我们来说是个很好的消遣，但我们仍然身处荒野，而且向导又受了重伤，我们几乎不知道要做什么。那些狼的嚎叫声一直在我脑子里回荡。事实上，除了那次在非洲海岸时我曾听到的叫声，还没什么声音让我如此满心恐惧。关于非洲那次的事情，我前面已经讲过了。由于这些事，再加上天快黑了，我们不得不赶快离开；要不然，我们一定会像星期五提议的那样，把那只值得收藏的巨大熊皮扒下来。但我们还有将近三里格的路要走，向导也一直催我们。于是我们丢下了大熊，继续我们的旅程。地面还是被雪覆盖着，但不像在山里那么深了，也没那么危险。我们后来听说，有一群凶残的野兽，由于饥饿所迫，从山上跑到了树林和平坦地区来找食物。它们在村子里做了许多祸事，惊扰了村子里的人，杀死了村民们的许多羊和马，还伤了一些人。我们还要经过一个危险的地方。向导告诉我们如果在这一片地区有狼的话，我们一定会在那里遇到。这是一个小平原，四周树木环绕，还有一条狭长的小道或者说是小路，我们得通过它才能穿过树林，然后到达我们准备要在那里过夜的村子。我们进入那片树林时，太阳再过半个小时就要下山了。等我们进了那个小平原，太阳已经下山一小会儿了。我们在第一片树林里没遇到什么情况，只是在树林里不超过两弗隆的一块小平地上看到了五条大狼全速飞奔过大路，一条跟着一条，好像是看见某个猎物，在追捕似的。它们没有发现我们，很快就消失不见了。看到这个，向导命令我们要保持准备的姿势，因为他相信还会有更多的狼要来。顺便说一下，那个向导本来就是个胆小懦弱的人。我们准备好了武器，并且时刻注意四周的情况，但直到我们穿过了那片将近半里格的树林，进入平原，也没有再见到狼。。我们一进入平原，便把四周仔细观察了一番。我们第一眼看到的是匹死马，应该说，是匹被狼群咬死的可怜的马，至少有十二条狼曾围着那匹马啃噬。与其说那些狼在吃那匹马，还不如说是挑拣啃它的骨头更恰当，因为那匹马的肉早先就被它们吃光了。我们认为打扰它们就餐并不合适，而它们也没有怎么注意到我们。星期五本来想向它们开枪，但是我无论如何没有同意，因为我觉得我们可能还有很多事要处理，比我们想到的要多。我们在平原上还没走到一半，就开始听到我们左边的树林里有狼群发出让人恐惧的嚎叫。之后不久，我们便看到有一百条左右的狼一窝蜂地径直向我们冲来，大部分都排成了一行，整齐得好像一支由经验丰富的军官集结的军队。我简直不知道该怎么对付它们，发现唯一的方法就是让大家靠拢，紧密地站成一排。我们很快就站好了队形。为了不让火力间隔太久，我下令一次只让一半人开枪，另一半没有开火的人要站着做好准备，如果狼群继续向我们进攻的话 就立刻给它们第二轮群射。那时，首先开枪的那些人不要假装又一次装长枪，而是要每人掏出一支手枪站着准备好。我们每个人都带着一支长枪和两支手枪。这样，通过这种方法，我们每次只用一半的人开枪，一共就可以开六轮枪了。不过目前还没有必要这么做。因为第一轮枪放出之后，我们的敌人被枪声和火光吓到了，完全停了下来。有四条狼被射中了头部，倒下了，另外的一些受了伤，流着血跑掉了。因为是在雪地上，所以我们能看见。我注意到它们虽然停了下来，但是并没有立即撤退。这时，我想到有人告诉过我，即使是最凶猛的野兽也会惧怕人类的声音，于是我让所有的同伴们跟我一起尽量大声喊叫。我发现这个办法并不完全是错的，因为我们一喊，那些狼就开始转身后退了。然后我又命令在它们背后开了第二轮枪。这下狼群开始飞速逃窜，逃进了树林。这让我们有时间来给枪重新上弹药，同时抓紧时间继续赶路。但是我们刚把枪装上弹药准备上路，就听到从左边同一片树林里传来了可怕的嚎叫。只是这次的声音来自前方较远处，正是我们的必经之路。夜幕降临了，光线变得模糊，这对于我们来说更不利了。但是嚎叫声越来越大，很容易辨别出这正是那些凶狠的野兽发出的嚎叫声。突然我们看见了三队狼，一队在我们左边，一队在后面，还有一队挡在前面，所以我们似乎被它们包围了。但是，由于狼群没有攻击我们，我们便继续前进，尽可能让马快走。但是道路太难走了，马只能小跑着艰难前进。就这样，我们看到了一片树林的入口，我们正是要穿过这片树林才能到达平原较远的一边。但是当我们走近那小路或者说关口时，不由大吃一惊，因为我们看到就在树林的入口处正站着无以计数的狼群。突然，我们听到有枪声在树林的另一个入口处响起，于是便向那边看去。只见一匹马，佩戴着马鞍和缰绳，像一阵风似的飞奔出来，大约有十六七条狼正在它身后全速追赶。马显然比狼跑得快，但我们觉得马不能一直保持那个速度。我们相信狼群最后一定会追上马的，毫无疑问，它们做到了。但这时我们看到了极其可怕的景象。当我们骑着马上前来到刚刚那匹马跑出来的入口处时，发现了另一匹马和两个人的尸体，是被那群野兽吞食的。我们刚刚听到的枪声无疑就是这两人其中之一放的，因为这人身边正放着一只开过火的枪，而至于这个人，他的头和身体的上半部分都已经被吃光了。这景象让我们满心恐惧，我们不知道要如何是好。但这群野兽很快就使我们决定了，因为它们当下已经聚集在了我们周围，急于要把我们变成食物。我肯定至少有三百条狼。幸好，对我们非常有利的是，在距离树林入口的不远处放置着一些大型的成材木，是去年夏天砍伐的，我想放在这里大概是想要运走的。我让我们这一小队人马退到那些木材中间，在一根长木后一字排开。我让大家下马，保持那根木材置于我们跟前，作为临时防壁，然后大家站成三角形或三条边沿，把马围在中间。我们这样做了，也幸好这样做了，因为那群猛兽对我们的攻击，在这片地区简直可以算是前所未有的凶猛了。它们嚎叫着向我们扑来，爬上了那根长木材，就像我说的，它是我们的临时防壁，好像它们只是冲着猎物而来，而它们的这种狂暴，主要是由它们看到了我们身后的马引起的。我命令大家像之前那次一样轮流开火。他们都瞄得很准，所以在放第一轮枪时就打死了几条狼。但我们必须保持持续开枪，因为这些狼如恶魔一般扑来，前赴后继。第二轮枪放完后，我们以为狼群暂时停止了进攻，我希望的是它们离开。但是不一会儿，后面的狼又冲到了前面，于是我们又用手枪开了两轮火。我估计这四轮开火打死了十七八条狼，打伤了的大概要多一倍。可是，狼又一次冲了上来。我不想我们的子弹这么快就用完，于是我叫来了我的仆人，但不是我的仆人星期五。因为星期五有更重要的任务，因为他的身手无比敏捷，在我们开枪时，他除了给自己的枪装弹，还负责装我的枪。所以就像我说的，我叫的是另一位仆人，然后给了他一角火药，让他沿着那根长木材撒下去，以形成一条宽大的火药线。他这样做了。他刚刚来得及离开，狼群就扑了过来，有的已经冲上了长木。于是我立刻抓起一支没有开过火的手枪，贴近那些火药开了一枪，让火药燃烧开来。于是冲上木材的那些狼都被烧伤了，有六七条因为火药的威力和对火的恐惧跌倒了，或者更确切地说是跳到了我们中间。我们立刻把这些解决掉了，而剩下的也出于对火光的恐惧，夜幕——现在天色已经很暗了——使得火光对于狼群来说更为可怕，因此它们稍稍后退了一点儿。这时，我命令用还没开过火的最后一批手枪放了一轮枪，然后我们又大声喊叫了一阵。这样才总算让狼群调头而去，我们发现只剩近二十条伤残的狼还在地上挣扎着。于是我们立即跃上前去，落下来用刀砍死了它们，而它们的哭嚎无疑是对它们同伴的最好提醒，让其余的狼都逃离我们而去。这正是我们所期望的。我们从头到尾一共杀死了大约六十条狼。如果是白天的话，我们应该还会杀死更多。清理了战场，我们便继续赶路了，因为我们还有接近一里格的路要走。行进时，有好几次我们都听到了饥饿的野兽在树林里嚎叫，有时我们好像还看到了它们的身影了。但是大雪非常刺眼，我们并不确定。大约又过了一个小时，我们抵达了打算在那里过夜的小镇。我们发现镇子上的人都十分恐惧，而且都全副武装。好像是因为前一个夜晚一些狼和熊袭击了村子，把人们吓坏了，因此不得不日夜巡逻守护，以保护牲畜，更重要的是保卫居民的安全。第二天早晨，我们向导的病情更严重了，由于两个伤口化脓，他的四肢都肿胀得很厉害，根本没法再走路了。于是我们不得不在当地又找了一位新的向导去图卢兹。我们发现那里气候温暖、物产丰富、景色怡人，并且没有大雪，没有狼或者其他类似的野兽。不过，当我们在图卢兹讲述我们的经历时，他们说这并不算什么，在山脚下那片大森林里是常常发生的，尤其是在大雪覆盖地面的时候。不过他们再三询问我们到底找了个什么样的向导，竟能在这样气候恶劣的季节里还敢冒险带我们走那条路。他们说，我们没被狼群通通吃掉真是意外。当我们告诉他们我们是如何排列的队形以及如何将马置于中央时，当地人狠狠责备了我们一番，说我们没死实在是万幸。因为那些狼正是因为看到了我们的马才会如此凶猛，它们想吃的是马。其他时候，狼是很害怕枪的。但是，当它们因极度饥饿而动怒时，对于那些马的渴望会让它们置危险于不顾。如果我们没有连续开枪，没有最终用火药策略制服它们的话，很可能我们已经被撕成碎片了。然而，如果我们当时甘于骑在马上不动，像骑士一样向狼群开枪，它们看到马上有人，就不会那么想要吃掉马了。另外，当地人最后还告诉我们，如果我们站在一起，不管我们的马的话，那些狼就会一心想要吞食那些马，这样一来我们就能安全撤离了，特别是在手握武器、人数众多的情况下。对于我来说，这一生中从未感觉过如此恐惧。看到三百多条这些恶魔般的家伙吼叫着扑来，张着血盆大口欲将我们吞食，而我们根本无处可躲、无处可逃，我已经放弃自己，准备等死了。事实上，我觉得我是不会想再去穿越那些山了。我想我宁愿在海上航行一千里格，即使我确定一周会遇上一次风暴。在法国的旅行，就没什么特别需要关注之处了——无非都是其他的旅行家们已经记录过的，而且绝对写得比我要好得多。我从图卢兹去到巴黎，又马不停蹄地走到了加来，经历了一整个寒冬的旅行，终于在一月十四日安全抵达多佛尔。现在，我已经抵达了旅程的圆心，并且在很短的时间内，我新获得的财产就安全转让到了我手上。另外，我随身带来的几张汇票现在也得以兑现了。我的首席向导兼私人顾问，也就是那位善良的老寡妇，为了感激我寄钱给她，不辞辛劳地给予了我无微不至的关怀。而我也完全相信她，把财产交给她保管我十分放心。而这位善良的有教养的女士也确实是品德高尚，让我自始至终都十分满意。</td>
		<td class="en">But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable.As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions;first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessively hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you;but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another way and keep going on;for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honour—that is his first quality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes you.My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood; and a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw.We were all a little surprised, when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow’s countenance.“O! O! O!” says Friday, three times, pointing to him; “O master, you give me the leave, me shake the hand with him; me make you good laugh.”I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased.“You fool,” said I, “he will eat you up.”—“Eatee me up! eatee me up!” says Friday, twice over again; “me eatee him up; me make you good laugh; you all stay here, me show you good laugh.”So down he sits, and gets off his boots in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand him.“Hark ye, hark ye,” says Friday, “me speakee with you.”We followed at a distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of the mountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the country was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and there.Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall;but it answered Friday’s end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh as he called it.As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking very long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a middling gallop; away reins Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help;so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going about his own business another way; and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then ran away; and I called out, “You dog! is this your making us laugh?Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature.”He heard me, and cried out, “No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you get much laugh,” and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear’s one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow;and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree.The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance: the first thing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous heavy.I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him.When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of a large branch, and the bear got about halfway to him.As soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, “Ha!” says he to us, “now you see me teachee the bear dance;” so he began jumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily.But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, “What, you come no farther? pray you come farther;” so he left jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come a little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again.We thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and called to Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but he cried out earnestly, “Oh, pray!Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then:” he would have said by-and-by.However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning for that too;for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at last.But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther, “Well, well,” says Friday, “you no come farther, me go; you no come to me, me come to you;”and upon this he went out to the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood still.“Well,” said I to him, “Friday, what will you do now?Why don’t you shoot him?”“No shoot,” says Friday, “no yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:” and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came back from the bough, where he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him every step,and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree, then, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely.At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead.Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he began to laugh very loud.“So we kill bear in my country,” says Friday.“So you kill them?” said I; “why, you have no guns.”—“No,” says he, “no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.”This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran much in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard anything that filled me with so much horror.These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went forward on our journey.The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food,and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and some people too.We had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us if there were more wolves in the country we should find them there; and this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long, narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge.It was within half-an-hour of sunset when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain;we met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in view;they took no notice of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments.Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was but a fainthearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves a coming.We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was near half a league, and entered the plain.As soon as we came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us.The first object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we could not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast; neither did they take much notice of us.Friday would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found we were like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware of.We had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers.I scarce knew in what manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only way;so we formed in a moment; but that we might not have too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the others, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us;and then that those that had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time;however, at present we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with the fire.Four of them being shot in the head, dropped; several others were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow.I found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon, remembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as loud as they could; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they began to retire and turn about.I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had but little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only that it was farther onward, the same way we were to go.The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it worse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures;and on a sudden we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them;however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only a good hard trot.In this manner, we came in view of the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the entrance.On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed;the horse had the advantage of them; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at last: no question but they did.But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures;and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body was eaten up.This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them.It happened, very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage.I drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place.They came on with a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us.I ordered our men to fire as before, every other man; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on those before.When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again.I was loth to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while we were engaged—but, as I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of powder, I had him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train.He did so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an unchanged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell; or rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire;we despatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened with the light, which the night—for it was now very near dark—made more terrible that they drew back a little;upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout;upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the crying and howling they made was better understood by their fellows; so that they all fled and left us.We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it been daylight we had killed many more.The field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go.We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain.In about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village, and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them;but when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground;but they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured.When we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun;but being excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger, and that if we had not by the continual fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces;whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise;and withal, they told us that at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having our firearms in our hands, being so many in number.For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open—mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again: I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a week.I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through France—nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with much more advantage than I can.I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and without any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time all my new discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which I brought with me having been currently paid.My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much nor care too great to employ for me;and I trusted her so entirely that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him (the old man) during his life,and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I had promised them, and which the plantation was to make good as a rent charge.And thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure—a life of Providence’s chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like of; beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在任何人都觉得我是好运连连，不会再去冒任何危险了——事实上我也确实会如此，如果没发生其他情况的话。但我已经习惯了游荡的生活，没有家庭，也没有那么多亲戚。而且，虽然我很富有，却没有结交什么新朋友。虽然我卖掉了在巴西的种植园，却还是忘不了那个国家，很想再回去看看。最重要的是，我情不自禁地想去我的岛上看看，去了解一下那些可怜的西班牙人是不是还留在那里。我真挚的朋友，那个老寡妇，诚挚地劝我打消这个念头。她竭力说服我，以至于近七年来，她都拦着我，没让我出国。这段时间里，我领养了我的两个侄儿，他们是我一个哥哥的孩子。大侄子自己有点财产，我将他培养成了一名绅士，并给了他一份产业，在我死后会并入他的财产。我把另一个侄子托付给了一位船长，五年后，我发现他成长为一个理智、勇敢、上进的年轻人。我给了他一条好船，让他出海。后来，正是这个年轻人把我这个老头子带入了我人生中的新一轮冒险。</td>
		<td class="en">Any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I was past running any more hazards—and so, indeed, I had been, if other circumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many relations;nor, however rich, had I contracted fresh acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong inclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards were in being there.My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she prevented my running abroad, during which time I took my two nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into my care;the eldest, having something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate after my decease.The other I placed with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to further adventures myself.</td></tr>
