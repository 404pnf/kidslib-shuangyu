		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果你是位哲学家，就能做这件事：登上一座高楼的最顶端，俯瞰三百英尺以下的同胞，把他们像虫子一样藐视。他们傻乎乎地挤在一起，就如同夏天池塘里无所事事的黑色水蝽一样，毫无目的地爬行打转。他们甚至不如令人钦佩的蚂蚁那样聪明，因为蚂蚁总是知道什么时候该回家。虽然你处的地位较高，蚂蚁的地位低下，但是它会经常回家，并换上拖鞋。</td>
		<td class="en">If you are a philosopher you can do this thing: you can go to the top of a high building, look down upon your fellow-men 300 feet below, and despise them as insects.Like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds, they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose.They do not even move with the admirable intelligence of ants, for ants always know when they are going home.The ant is of a lowly station, but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，对于这大楼顶上的哲学家来说，人类只不过是卑微地爬行的甲壳虫而已。经纪人、诗人、百万富翁、擦鞋匠、美女、泥瓦匠和政治家就像小黑点，在只有你拇指一样宽的街道上躲避比他们大的黑点。</td>
		<td class="en">Man, then, to the housetopped philosopher, appears to be but a creeping, contemptible beetle.Brokers, poets, millionaires, bootblacks, beauties, hod-carriers and politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than your thumb.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从高处俯瞰城市，它就退化成了一堆难以理解的扭曲建筑物和一些莫名其妙的景象；令人敬畏的海洋就像一个养鸭的池塘；地球本身就像一个被打飞了的高尔夫球。生活的全部细节都不见了。哲学家凝视着头顶无限的天空，让灵魂随着新的景象扩展。他觉得自己就是永恒的后人，是时间的孩子。由于他是永恒的后代，空间也应该是他的。一想到某天他的同类将会穿梭于星球间神秘的空中道路时，他就无比激动。他脚下是一个微小的世界，上面高耸的钢筋混凝土建筑就如同喜玛拉雅山上的一粒尘埃——但地球只是这种旋转着的无数小微粒中的一颗。与那渺小城市上空以及周围的浩瀚而宁静的宇宙相比，下面那些忙忙碌碌的黑色昆虫的野心、成就、微不足道的征服和爱好又算什么呢？</td>
		<td class="en">From this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of distorted buildings and impossible perspectives; the revered ocean is a duck pond; the earth itself a lost golf ball.All the minutiae of life are gone.The philosopher gazes into the infinite heavens above him, and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view.He feels that he is the heir to Eternity and the child of Time.Space, too, should be his by the right of his immortal heritage, and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse those mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet.The tiny world beneath his feet upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a Himalayan mountain—it is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms.What are the ambitions, the achievements, the paltry conquests and loves of those restless black insects below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and around their insignificant city?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哲学家肯定有这些想法。这些想法在世界哲学体系中被明确地汇编起来并在结尾处恰如其分地打上问号，以此来代表站在高处那些深刻的思想家们恒定不变的冥思苦想。当哲学家乘着电梯下来时，他的思维更加开阔了，内心一片平静，他那关于宇宙进化论的创世观念就像猎户座夏季腰带上的扣子那么宽阔。</td>
		<td class="en">It is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts.They have been expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers on high places.And when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader, his heart is at peace, and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle of Orion’s summer belt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是如果你的名字碰巧叫黛西，十九岁，在第八大道的糖果店工作，住在一间五英尺宽八英尺长、从走廊隔出来的寒冷的小卧室里，每个星期挣六美元，吃的是十美分一顿的午餐，每天早上六点半起床一直工作到晚上九点，并且从来没学过哲学，也许你从楼顶看到的东西就不会是那样的。</td>
		<td class="en">But if your name happened to be Daisy, and you worked in an Eighth Avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom, five feet by eight, and earned $6 per week, and ate ten-cent lunches and were nineteen years old, and got up at 6: 30 and worked till 9, and never had studied philosophy, maybe things wouldn’t look that way to you from the top of a skyscraper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有两个小伙子在追求不懂哲学的黛西。其中一个是乔，他在纽约经营一家算得上最小的商店。它跟市政工程局的工具箱差不多大，像燕子窝一样附着在城市商业区摩天大楼的转角处。店里卖水果、糖果、报纸、歌本、香烟和当季的柠檬汽水。当寒冬颤动他冻结的头发时，乔不得不让自己和水果都转移到里面，商店的空间恰好只可以容纳店主、货物、一个醋瓶大小的小火炉和一个顾客。</td>
		<td class="en">Two sighed for the hand of Daisy, the unphilosophical.One was Joe, who kept the smallest store in New York.It was about the size of a tool-box of the D. P. W., and was stuck like a swallow’s nest against a corner of a down-town skyscraper.Its stock consisted of fruit, candies, newspapers, song books, cigarettes, and lemonade in season.When stern winter shook his congealed locks and Joe had to move himself and the fruit inside, there was exactly room in the store for the proprietor, his wares, a stove the size of a vinegar cruet, and one customer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔不是那种让我们永远对赋格音乐和水果狂热的人。他是一个很有能力的美国青年，一直在攒钱，并希望黛西能帮他花掉。他已经问过她三次了。</td>
		<td class="en">Joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit.He was a capable American youth who was laying by money, and wanted Daisy to help him spend it.Three times he had asked her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我把钱都攒了起来，黛西，”这就是他的情歌，“你知道我多么需要你。我的那个商店不是很大，但是——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I got money saved up, Daisy,” was his love song; “and you know how bad I want you.That store of mine ain’t very big, but—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，是吗？”那个不懂哲学的人会这么和他对唱，“可是，我听说沃纳梅克正在竭力劝说你明年把部分地方转租给他们。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, ain’t it?” would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one.“Why, I heard Wanamaker’s was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黛西每天早晚都会路过乔的店的角落。</td>
		<td class="en">Daisy passed Joe’s corner every morning and evening.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好，小不点儿！”她总是这么打招呼,“你的店看起来又空了些。你一定又卖了一盒口香糖。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hello, Two-by-Four!” was her usual greeting.“Seems to me your store looks emptier.You must have sold a pack of chewing gum.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这里确实没有太多地方，”乔就慢吞吞地咧嘴笑着回答说，“可绝对容得下你，黛西。我和这个商店随时都等着你来接受我们。你觉得不会隔得太久了吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ain’t much room in here, sure,” Joe would answer, with his slow grin, “except for you, Daise.Me and the store are waitin’ for you whenever you’ll take us.Don’t you think you might before long?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“商店！”——黛西翘着鼻子不屑一顾地说——“沙丁鱼罐头！你还说，要等我进来？天哪！在我能进去之前，你得扔出一百来磅的糖果，乔。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Store!”—a fine scorn was expressed by Daisy’s uptilted nose—“sardine box!Waitin’ for me, you say?Gee! You’d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before I could get inside of it, Joe.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那样的公平交换我可不会介意。”乔奉承说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I wouldn’t mind an even swap like that,” said Joe, complimentary.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黛西的存在位置四面受限。她得侧着身子才能从柜台和货架之间走进糖果店。她自己的那个从过道隔出来的卧室舒适得几乎让她和周围融为一体。墙与墙之间是如此地近，墙纸弄出的声音使房间变成一座通天塔。她可以一手开灯，一手关门，同时也不必把目光从镜子里自己的棕色束发上移开。在她的梳妆台上有一张镶了金框的乔的照片——但有时她接着想到的总是乔附着在大楼角落里那个肥皂盒一样大的滑稽的小商店，随即她就会微微一笑，把那情愫抛之脑后。</td>
		<td class="en">Daisy’s existence was limited in every way.She had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store.In her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness.The walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect Babel of noise.She could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror.She had Joe’s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser, and sometimes—but her next thought would always be of Joe’s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building, and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在乔之后几个月，黛西又有了另一位追求者。他搬进了黛西住的公寓寄宿。他是个叫达布斯特的哲学家。虽然他很年轻，身上的学问就像贴在帕塞伊克（新泽西州）衣箱上的欧洲国家行李标签一样醒目。他的学问都是从百科全书和实用手册里学到的；但在智慧方面，他还是稍稍有些欠缺，她从他旁边经过时，他还站在街上吸着鼻子，连她汽车的牌号都没有看清楚。</td>
		<td class="en">Daisy’s other suitor followed Joe by several months.He came to board in the house where she lived.His name was Dabster, and he was a philosopher.Though young, attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a Passaic (N. J.) suit-case.Knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information; but as for wisdom, when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他能够而且愿意告诉你水是由什么构成的、豌豆炖牛肉有助于增长肌肉、《圣经》里最短的诗、固定二百五十六块四英尺的防雨木瓦板需要多少磅钉子、伊利诺斯州坎卡基的人口是多少、斯宾诺莎的理论是什么、H. 麦凯·通布利先生的第二个大厅男仆叫什么名字、霍沙克隧道的长度是多少、母鸡孵蛋的最佳时间、宾夕法尼亚州浮木站和红岸火炉站之间铁道邮局邮递员的工资数额，以及猫的前腿有多少根骨头。</td>
		<td class="en">He could and would tell you the proportion of water and muscle-making properties of peas and veal, the shortest verse in the Bible, the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten 256 shingles laid four inches to the weather, the population of Kankakee, Ill., the theories of Spinoza, the name of Mr. H. McKay Twombly’s second hall footman, the length of the Hoosac Tunnel, the best time to set a hen, the salary of the railway post-office messenger between Driftwood and Red Bank Furnace, Pa., and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达布斯特并不认为学习是什么难事。他的数据就如同荷兰芹菜的枝那么多，他用它来装饰闲谈大餐，如果认为那对你的胃口，他就会端出来招待你。此外，他在公寓就餐时还把这些数据当作临时防护墙。他向你发出一连串数字的炮弹，问你一英尺长、五英寸宽、二又四分之三英寸高的铁块有多重，明尼苏达州斯内灵的平均年降雨量是多少，当你鼓足勇气微微问他为什么母鸡会穿过马路时，他正用叉子叉盘子里最好的一块鸡肉。</td>
		<td class="en">The weight of learning was no handicap to Dabster.His statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste.And again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse.Firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bar-iron 5 × 2¾ inches, and the average annual rainfall at Fort Snelling, Minn., he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样，他有这些小聪明，加上他仪表堂堂、头发油光可鉴，是下午三点钟在商业区购物的那种人，小人国商场的乔似乎有了一个需要拔剑相见、认真对付的情敌。不过乔没有剑。即使有，店铺里也没有拔出来施展的空间。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus, brightly armed, and further equipped with a measure of good looks, of a hair-oily, shopping-district-at-three-in-the-afternoon kind, it seems that Joe, of the Lilliputian emporium, had a rival worthy of his steel.But Joe carried no steel.There wouldn’t have been room in his store to draw it if he had.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >星期六下午四点左右，黛西和达布斯特先生来到乔的货摊前。达布斯特戴着一顶丝制大礼帽——好吧，黛西毕竟是个女人，在乔没有看到之前，那顶帽子是不会放回盒子里的。他们表面上是来买菠萝味口香糖。乔把东西递到店门口。他看到大礼帽能够面不改色，也不畏缩。</td>
		<td class="en">One Saturday afternoon, about four o’clock, Daisy and Mr. Dabster stopped before Joe’s booth.Dabster wore a silk hat, and—well, Daisy was a woman, and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until Joe had seen it.A stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call.Joe supplied it through the open side of his store.He did not pale or falter at sight of the hat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“达布斯特先生要带我到大楼顶上去看风景。”黛西在介绍完她的爱慕者们相互认识后说，“我从来没登上过摩天大楼。我猜那上面一定很漂亮很有趣。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mr. Dabster’s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view,” said Daisy, after she had introduced her admirers.“I never was on a skyscraper.I guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯！”乔回答说。</td>
		<td class="en">“H’m!” said Joe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达布斯特先生说：“从高楼顶端看到的全景不仅壮观，而且很发人深思。欢乐一定正等着黛西小姐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The panorama,” said Mr. Dabster, “exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime, but instructive.Miss Daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“楼顶和这里一样，风很大。”乔说，“你衣服穿得足够暖和吗，黛西？”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s windy up there, too, as well as here,” said Joe.“Are you dressed warm enough, Daise?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然！我都准备好了。”黛西望着他紧皱的眉头，害羞地笑着说，“你看起来就像箱子里的木乃伊一样，乔。你是不是刚进了一品脱的花生或一个苹果？怎么你的存货看起来多出来那么多。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sure thing!I’m all lined,” said Daisy, smiling slyly at his clouded brow.“You look just like a mummy in a case, Joe.Ain’t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple?Your stock looks awful over-stocked.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黛西为自己的笑话得意地咯咯笑了；乔不得不陪她笑笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Daisy giggled at her favorite joke; and Joe had to smile with her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“与这座大楼相比，您的住处怎么说有点儿小。呃——呃——先生，”达布斯特说，“我想这个地方差不多三百四十英尺长，一百英尺宽。所占的比例相当于把半个俾路支斯坦放在面积相当于美国落基山脉以东地区、加拿大的安大略省和比利时面积总和的地域时所占的比例。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Your quarters are somewhat limited, Mr.—er—er,” remarked Dabster, “in comparison with the size of this building.I understand the area of its side to be about 340 by 100 feet.That would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of Beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, with the Province of Ontario and Belgium added.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是那样吗，老兄？”乔快活地说，“你确实是数字方面的聪明人，好吧。那么你认为一头公驴不叫唤，并歇上一又八分之五分钟静止不动，能吃多少平方磅的干草？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Is that so, sport?” said Joe, genially.“You are Weisenheimer on figures, all right.How many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin’ long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几分钟后，黛西和达布斯特先生走出电梯，来到摩天大楼的顶层。然后，他们登上一节短而陡峭的楼梯，来到了屋顶。达布斯特领着她来到围栏边，让她可以看到下面街道上移动的小黑点。</td>
		<td class="en">A few minutes later Daisy and Mr. Dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper.Then up a short, steep stairway and out upon the roof.Dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是什么？”她颤抖地问。在这之前她从来没有来过这么高的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">“What are they?” she asked, trembling.She had never been on a height like this before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，这个时候达布斯特必须充当塔顶哲学家的角色，引导她的灵魂来迎接无限广阔的空间。</td>
		<td class="en">And then Dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower, and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“两足动物。”他严肃地说，“看，从区区三百四十英尺的高度看下去，他们变成了什么——只不过是些来来回回随意爬行的昆虫而已。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Bipeds,” he said, solemnly.“See what they become even at the small elevation of 340 feet—mere crawling insects going to and fro at random.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，他们不是那样的，”黛西突然大声说道，“他们是人！我看到一辆汽车。哦，快看！我们居然这么高？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, they ain’t anything of the kind,” exclaimed Daisy, suddenly—“they’re folks!I saw an automobile.Oh, gee! Are we that high up?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“到这儿来。”达布斯特说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Walk over this way,” said Dabster.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他让她看到，这伟大的城市就像是在下面远处整齐排列的玩具一样，虽然天色尚早，在这个冬日的下午，在灯塔发出的第一缕灯光的照耀下，它已经到处闪烁着星星点点的光。再远处，南边和东边的海湾和海洋神秘地消逝在天际。</td>
		<td class="en">He showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below, starred here and there, early as it was, by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon.And then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不喜欢这里，”黛西眨着充满困惑的蓝眼睛说，“我们下去吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t like it,” declared Daisy, with troubled blue eyes.“Say we go down.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但哲学家却不愿意错过这次机会。他要让她看看他广阔的心胸、对无限的掌握和对统计数字的记忆力。此后，她将不再满足于在纽约最小的商店里买口香糖。因此他开始大谈特谈人事的渺小，即使只离地面稍稍远一点儿，人类和他们的成绩就好像一枚被用了三次的一美元的十分之一一样微不足道。因此人类应该考虑恒星体系和埃皮克提图的箴言，并感到慰藉。</td>
		<td class="en">But the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity.He would let her behold the grandeur of his mind, the half-nelson he had on the infinite, and the memory he had for statistics.And then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum at the smallest store in New York.And so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs, and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed.And that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of Epictetus and be comforted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不应该带我来这儿。”黛西说，“唉，站得这么高，人们看起来就像跳蚤一样是多么可怕的一件事啊。我们看着的这些人中的某一个有可能就是乔。嘿，吉米尼！我们不如去新泽西吧！哦，我呆在这儿有点儿害怕！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You don’t carry me with you,” said Daisy.“Say, I think it’s awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas.One of them we saw might have been Joe.Why, Jiminy! We might as well be in New Jersey!Say, I’m afraid up here!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哲学家傻笑着。</td>
		<td class="en">The philosopher smiled fatuously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“地球，”他说，“在宇宙空间中不过只有一粒麦子那么大。瞧上面。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The earth,” said he, “is itself only as a grain of wheat in space.Look up there.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黛西不安地仰望着天空。短暂的一天过去了，星星已经出来了。</td>
		<td class="en">Daisy gazed upward apprehensively.The short day was spent and the stars were coming out above.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那颗星是金星，”达布斯特说，“是黑夜之星。她距太阳有六千六百万英里。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yonder star,” said Dabster, “is Venus, the evening star.She is 66,000,000 miles from the sun.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“胡说！”黛西突然激动地说，“你以为我是从什么地方来的——布鲁克林吗？我们店里的苏茜·普赖斯——她哥哥寄一张车票来要她去旧金山玩——那才三千英里。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Fudge!” said Daisy, with a brief flash of spirit, “where do you think I come from—Brooklyn?Susie Price, in our store—her brother sent her a ticket to go to San Francisco—that’s only three thousand miles.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哲学家充满溺爱地微笑着。</td>
		<td class="en">The philosopher smiled indulgently.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们的地球，”他说，“离太阳有九千一百万英里。一等星总共有十八个，离我们的距离比太阳远二十一万一千倍。如果它们中的一个陨灭了，那么要过三年我们才能看见它的光消失。六等星有六千个。它们的光到达地球差不多要三十六年的时间。用直径十八英尺的望远镜我们可以看到四千三百万个星球，其中包括十三等星，它们的光要走两千七百年才能到达我们这里。这每一颗星——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Our world,” he said, “is 91,000,000 miles from the sun.There are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are 211,000 times further from us than the sun is.If one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out.There are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude.It takes thirty-six years for the light of one of them to reach the earth.With an eighteen-foot telescope we can see 43,000,000 stars, including those of the thirteenth magnitude, whose light takes 2,700 years to reach us.Each of these stars—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你骗人，” 黛西生气地叫道，“你打算吓唬我。你的目的达到了；我要下去！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re lyin’,” cried Daisy, angrily.“You’re tryin’ to scare me.And you have; I want to go down!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她跺着脚。</td>
		<td class="en">She stamped her foot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“大角星——”哲学家用安抚的口吻说道，但他被一个源于大自然广度的数学证明打断了，他试图用记忆而不是用心来诠释大自然的辽阔。对于用心诠释自然的人来说，星星只是给那些快乐地漫步在它们下面的情侣们送上柔和的光亮而被特意地置于苍穹；在九月的夜晚，如果你挽着你心爱的人，踮起脚尖，你几乎可以触摸到它们。可是它们的光线确实要走三年才能到达我们这儿！</td>
		<td class="en">“Arcturus—” began the philosopher, soothingly, but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart.For to the heart-expounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them; and if you stand tiptoe some September night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand.Three years for their light to reach us, indeed!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >西方划过一颗流星，光亮把摩天大楼的屋顶照得犹如正午。它在天空画出一条似火的抛物线，驶向东方。它划过之时发出嘶嘶声，黛西尖叫起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Out of the west leaped a meteor, lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday.Its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east.It hissed as it went, and Daisy screamed.</td></tr>
