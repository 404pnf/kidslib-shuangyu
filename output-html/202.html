		<td class="en">by Jack London</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是一个发生在夏威夷关于艾丽斯·阿卡纳的故事，不是现在但距现在也不远。那时埃布尔·阿·约正在火奴鲁鲁宣扬他著名的福音布道会，并成功地劝服艾丽斯·阿卡纳向上帝告解。可艾丽斯所说的事和那时依然健在的一代人的过去息息相关。</td>
		<td class="en">This, of Alice Akana, is an affair of Hawaii, not of this day, but of days recent enough, when Abel Ah Yo preached his famous revival in Honolulu and persuaded Alice Akana to tell her soul.But what Alice told concerned itself with the earlier history of the then surviving generation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为艾丽斯·阿卡纳已经五十岁了，她很早就开始谋生，并且一直过得都很阔绰。她所知道的事情可以追溯到许多家族、工厂和种植园的起源和创立时期。她是律师们所寻找的准确信息的活宝库，无论他们需要的信息是关系到土地边界和土地赠予，或是婚姻、生辰、遗产亦或是丑闻。但她很少会告诉他们所想知道的事，因为她的嘴很严；只有是为了公正服务并且没人受到伤害时，她才肯说。</td>
		<td class="en">For Alice Akana was fifty years old, had begun life early, and, early and late, lived it spaciously.What she knew went back into the roots and foundations of families, businesses, and plantations.She was the one living repository of accurate information that lawyers sought out, whether the information they required related to land-boundaries and land gifts, or to marriages, births, bequests, or scandals.Rarely, because of the tight tongue she kept behind her teeth, did she give them what they asked; and when she did was when only equity was served and no one was hurt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >早在艾丽斯少女时期，她就过着充满鲜花、乐曲、美酒和舞蹈的生活；而在她晚年的时候，草裙舞剧场的办事处指派她为这些狂欢活动的负责人。在这种氛围中，上帝和人类的命令以及警告都被禁用了，人们可以随心所欲地说话，她获得那些事情的历史知识从不是源于谣传，而且极少源于猜测。嘴严很好地保护了她，因此，虽然老人们知道她肯定知道，却没从听到她说过卡拉考娃船屋里的时光或是说说考察战船的官员们的性高潮，亦或是世界各国的外交官、部长和参赞们的闲话。</td>
		<td class="en">For Alice had lived, from early in her girlhood, a life of flowers, and song, and wine, and dance; and, in her later years, had herself been mistress of these revels by office of mistress of the hula house.In such atmosphere, where mandates of God and man and caution are inhibited, and where woozled tongues will wag, she acquired her historical knowledge of things never otherwise whispered and rarely guessed.And her tight tongue had served her well, so that, while the old-timers knew she must know, none ever heard her gossip of the times of Kalakaua’s boathouse, nor of the high times of officers of visiting warships, nor of the diplomats and ministers and councils of the countries of the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，到了五十岁，她承载着的历史轰动事件，一旦被曝光就足以震撼岛上的社交和商业生活，可她依然紧闭嘴巴，艾丽斯·阿卡纳是草裙舞剧场的负责人和那些为皇室、盛宴、乡村别墅招待会、山芋晚餐和好奇的游客们跳舞的舞娘们的管理者。到了五十岁，她不仅丰满，而且像个波利尼西亚农民一样又矮又胖，体格强壮，没有生理缺陷，足以有希望很长寿。可就是到了五十岁，在机遇和好奇心的驱动下，她闯入了埃布尔·阿·约的福音布道会。</td>
		<td class="en">So, at fifty, loaded with historical dynamite sufficient, if it were ever exploded, to shake the social and commercial life of the Islands, still tight of tongue, Alice Akana was mistress of the hula house, manageress of the dancing girls who hula’d for royalty, for luaus (feasts), house-parties, poi suppers, and curious tourists.And, at fifty, she was not merely buxom, but short and fat in the Polynesian peasant way, with a constitution and lack of organic weakness that promised incalculable years.But it was at fifty that she strayed, quite by chance of time and curiosity, into Abel Ah Yo’s revival meeting.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在埃布尔·阿·约，从神学理论和语言应用水平来说，他是个和比利·桑迪（一位著名运动员退役后成为传教士）一样复杂的人物。就他的血统而言，他就更为复杂，因为他有四分之一的葡萄牙人血统，四分之一的苏格兰人血统，四分之一的夏威夷人血统和四分之一的中国人的血统。他点燃的五旬节圣火比任何只有一种血统的他所能点燃的圣火更为炽热，更为多样化。因为在他的身上集合着精明与奸诈、机警与智慧、狡猾与稚嫩、激情与哲理以及痛苦的精神追求，这些帮助他超越了现实的泥潭，也超越了造就他本身的那四种截然不同的血统。这也造就了他对自己整体智慧聪明的自我欺骗。</td>
		<td class="en">Now Abel Ah Yo, in his theology and word wizardry, was as much mixed a personage as Billy Sunday.In his genealogy he was much more mixed, for he was compounded of one-fourth Portuguese, one-fourth Scotch, one-fourth Hawaiian, and one-fourth Chinese.The Pentecostal fire he flamed forth was hotter and more variegated than could any one of the four races of him alone have flamed forth.For in him were gathered together the cannyness and the cunning, the wit and the wisdom, the subtlety and the rawness, the passion and the philosophy, the agonizing spirit-groping and he legs up to the knees in the dung of reality, of the four radically different breeds that contributed to the sum of him.His, also, was the clever self-deceivement of the entire clever compound.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说到语言应用的水平，他会让比利·桑迪这一语言的俚语和习语大师无地自容。因为在埃布尔·阿·约这个名字里，就囊括四种现存语言里的五个动词、名词、形容词和比喻。这几种语言极其混杂地融合在一起，组成了他的表达储备库，就算是无数个比利·桑迪也会淹没其中。所有种族中最优秀的混种，一个混杂争斗的产物，混合人种至高无上的结晶就是埃布尔·阿·约。他就像是一只变色龙，自命不凡地在多重角色间转换，发挥才智，或是令人吃惊的正面攻击，或是令人困惑惊讶地从侧面拂过那些相同的心灵。这些灵魂的组成要简单得多，他们加入他的福音布道会，坐在他的脚下，随着他的火焰一同燃烧。</td>
		<td class="en">When it came to word wizardry, he had Billy Sunday, master of slang and argot of one language, skinned by miles.For in Abel Ah Yo were the five verbs, and nouns, and adjectives, and metaphors of four living languages.Intermixed and living promiscuously and vitally together, he possessed in these languages a reservoir of expression in which a myriad Billy Sundays could drown.Of no race, a mongrel par excellence, a heterogeneous scrabble, the genius of the admixture was superlatively Abel Ah Yo’s.Like a chameleon, he titubated and scintillated grandly between the diverse parts of him, stunning by frontal attack and surprising and confounding by flanking sweeps the mental homogeneity of the more simply constituted souls who came in to his revival to sit under him and flame to his flaming.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃布尔·阿·约相信他自己和他的复杂血统，就像他相信自己怪异的混杂观念一样:上帝和他以及其他人看起来都很相似，上帝不仅仅是某一个部落的上帝，而是世界的上帝，这个世界的上帝必须看起来和世界所有种族的人们看起来同样相似，即使这样会造成混种。而且这个观念发挥作用了。中国人、韩国人、日本人、夏威夷人、波多黎各人、俄国人、英国人、法国人——所有种族的成员——没有矛盾，并肩跪下来，听从他对神的修正。</td>
		<td class="en">Abel Ah Yo believed in himself and his mixedness, as he believed in the mixedness of his weird concept that God looked as much like him as like any man, being no mere tribal god, but a world god that must look equally like all races of all the world, even if it led to piebaldness.And the concept worked.Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian, Porto Rican, Russian, English, French—members of all races—knelt without friction, side by side, to his revision of deity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他本人在稚嫩的年轻时代曾是英格兰教会的叛教者，多年来，埃布尔·阿·约一直认为自己是和犹大一样的罪人并为之痛苦。从宗教本质上来说，他曾背弃过上帝。所以，他很像犹大。犹大让人憎恶。所以他，埃布尔·阿·约，也是可恶的；而他不想让自己被人厌恶。所以，就人类本性来说，他局促不安、苦思冥想，要摆脱这种谴责。一天，他找到了为自己解脱的说词了。他总结出，断定犹大是罪人的教义是对高于一切、代表正义的上帝的误解。犹大曾经是上帝的仆人，他被专门选来完成一项极其低贱的任务。因此，曾经忠诚的犹大只是在神的指引下成为了一个叛徒，他是一位圣人。因此，他，埃布尔·阿·约，是通过背叛某一个具体教派来成为圣人的，而且他能够随时接近上帝的恩典。</td>
		<td class="en">Himself in his tender youth an apostate to the Church of England, Abel Ah Yo had for years suffered the lively sense of being a Judas sinner.Essentially religious, he had foresworn the Lord.Like Judas therefore he was.Judas was damned.Wherefore he, Abel Ah Yo, was damned; and he did not want to be damned.So, quite after the manner of humans, he squirmed and twisted to escape damnation.The day came when he solved his escape.The doctrine that Judas was damned, he concluded, was a misinterpretation of God, who, above all things, stood for justice.Judas had been God’s servant, specially selected to perform a particularly nasty job.Therefore Judas, ever faithful, a betrayer only by divine command, was a saint.Ergo, he, Abel Ah Yo, was a saint by very virtue of his apostasy to a particular sect, and he could have access with clear grace any time to God.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个理论成为他布道的主要教义之一，并在净化任何其他信仰的背叛者的良心时极为有效。在这些背叛者们隐藏的潜意识中，他们正被犹大罪孽的负担压垮。对埃布尔·阿·约来说，上帝的旨意就好像是他，埃布尔·阿·约，自己安排的一样清楚。最终所有的人都会被救赎，虽然有的人需要的时间比别人长一些，而且只会得到后排座位。在纷争不断减少的世界中，人类的位置是确定的，也是注定的——如果不是出于其他别的原因，那么就是通过否定使纷争在不断变少。这只不过是人类愚蠢臆想中的鬼怪,而且，通过尖锐大胆的思想和言论，以及生动的俚语用最熟悉的语言深深影响他的听众们的思维过程，他将鬼怪从他们的头脑中驱逐出去，向他们展示上帝构思的仁爱慈善，因而使他们得到精神上的宁静与平和。</td>
		<td class="en">This theory became one of the major tenets of his preaching, and was especially efficacious in cleansing the consciences of the back-sliders from all other faiths who else, in the secrecy of their subconscious selves, were being crushed by the weight of the Judas sin.To Abel Ah Yo, God’s plan was as clear as if he, Abel Ah Yo, had planned it himself.All would be saved in the end, although some took longer than others, and would win only to backseats.Man’s place in the ever-fluxing chaos of the world was definite and pre-ordained—if by no other token, then by denial that there was any ever-fluxing chaos.This was a mere bugbear of mankind’s addled fancy; and, by stinging audacities of thought and speech, by vivid slang that bit home by sheerest intimacy into his listeners’ mental processes, he drove the bugbear from their brains, showed them the loving clarity of God’s design, and, thereby, induced in them spiritual serenity and calm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艾丽丝·阿卡纳这个纯正、单一的夏威夷人，有多少机会能抵挡住他那精心谋划、 充满民主色彩、兼具四大种族优势、饱含枪言弹语的攻击呢？通过接触，几乎同她一样，他也知道人生沉浮反复无常——他曾在夏威夷和加利福尼亚间行驶的客船上当歌手，之后，漂洋过海，从巴巴里海岸去海尼的小酒馆做吧台生。实际上，他是离开了大学俱乐部头号吧台生的职位，开始他伟大福音布道会的。</td>
		<td class="en">What chance had Alice Akana, herself pure and homogeneous Hawaiian, against his subtle, democratic-tinged, four-race-engendered, slang-munitioned attack?He knew, by contact, almost as much as she about the waywardness of living and sinning—having been singing boy on the passenger-ships between Hawaii and California, and, after that, bar boy, afloat and ashore, from the Barbary Coast to Heinie’s Tavern.In point of fact, he had left his job of Number One Bar Boy at the University Club to embark on his great preachment revival.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，当艾丽斯·阿卡纳不由自主地溜进来嘲笑的时候，她还是向埃布尔·阿·约的上帝祈祷，这个艾丽斯听过的最明智的上帝动摇了艾丽斯冷静的头脑。她把钱放进埃布尔·阿·约的募捐盘中，关闭了草裙舞剧场，解散了草裙舞的舞娘们，让她们以一种更不正大光明的方式生存，摈弃了艳丽色彩、衣服和花环，买了本圣经。</td>
		<td class="en">So, when Alice Akana strayed in to scoff, she remained to pray to Abel Ah Yo’s god, who struck her hard-headed mind as the most sensible god of which she had ever heard.She gave money into Abel Ah Yo’s collection plate, closed up the hula house, and dismissed the hula dancers to more devious ways of earning a livelihood, shed her bright colours and raiments and flower garlands, and bought a Bible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个时候，在火奴鲁鲁周围到处呈现着宗教的狂热。这是一项人类接近上帝的民主运动。也曾请过有身份地位的人，但他们从没来过。只有那些愚蠢和谦卑的底层人才会以忏悔的姿态跪下，承认疾病的沉重和罪孽的痛苦，消除和净化他们所有的困惑，重新走向前站在太阳下，像孩子一样纯洁，被埃布尔·阿·约的神拥举起。简单说来，埃布尔·阿·约的福音布道会是罪孽和精神问题的净化所，在那里，有罪的人解除了他们的负担，再次变得轻松、欢快、精神健康。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a time of religious excitement in the purlieus of Honolulu.The thing was a democratic movement of the people toward God.Place and caste were invited, but never came.The stupid lowly, and the humble lowly, only, went down on its knees at the penitent form, admitted its pathological weight and hurt of sin, eliminated and purged all its bafflements, and walked forth again upright under the sun, child-like and pure, upborne by Abel Ah Yo’s god’s arm around it.In short, Abel Ah Yo’s revival was a clearing house for sin and sickness of spirit, wherein sinners were relieved of their burdens and made light and bright and spiritually healthy again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可艾丽斯不开心。她还没有被净化。她买来圣经，分发出去，向募捐盘里放入更多的钱，光荣地演唱所有赞美诗的低音部分，却不肯向上帝告解。埃布尔·阿·约和她争辩过，结果总是徒劳。她不肯以忏悔的姿态跪下，说出身上的污点——昔日好朋友们不好的事情。“你不能服侍两个主人，”埃布尔·阿·约告诉她，“地狱里全是尝试过这么做的人。要和上帝和平相处，你必须拥有单一、纯洁的心灵。直到你在会上直接向上帝告解，上帝才会救赎你。同时你还要承受你随身携带的罪孽溃烂的痛苦。”</td>
		<td class="en">But Alice was not happy.She had not been cleared.She bought and dispersed Bibles, contributed more money to the plate, contralto’d gloriously in all the hymns, but would not tell her soul.In vain Abel Ah Yo wrestled with her.She would not go down on her knees at the penitent form and voice the things of tarnish within her—the ill things of good friends of the old days.“You cannot serve two masters,” Abel Ah Yo told her.“Hell is full of those who have tried.Single of heart and pure of heart must you make your peace with God.Not until you tell your soul to God right out in meeting will you be ready for redemption.In the meantime you will suffer the canker of the sin you carry about within you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从科学角度说，虽然埃布尔·阿·约不懂科学而且他一直在嘲笑科学，但他是对的。直到她通过告解将自己所有的世故，包括和别人共享的秘密从心中拔除，她才能再次像孩子一样，沐浴在上帝的恩典之中。按新教徒的要求，她必须将自己的灵魂暴露在公众之下，而天主教的方式是通过私下忏悔来完成的。这种暴露的结果将会是统一、平静、幸福、纯净、救赎和永生。</td>
		<td class="en">Scientifically, though he did not know it and though he continually jeered at science, Abel Ah Yo was right.Not could she be again as a child and become radiantly clad in God’s grace, until she had eliminated from her soul, by telling, all the sophistications that had been hers, including those she shared with others.In the Protestant way, she must bare her soul in public, as in the Catholic way it was done in the privacy of the confessional.The result of such baring would be unity, tranquillity, happiness, cleansing, redemption, and immortal life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“做出选择！”埃布尔·阿·约吼道，“忠于上帝，还是忠于人类。”可艾丽斯不能选择。她将自己的舌头与人类的荣誉锁在一起太久了。“我会说出所有关于我自己的事情。”她辩解道，“上帝知道我讨厌自己的灵魂并愿意将其净化，让它再次发光，就和我还是卡内奥赫的小姑娘那时一样——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Choose!”Abel Ah Yo thundered.“Loyalty to God, or loyalty to man.”And Alice could not choose.Too long had she kept her tongue locked with the honour of man.“I will tell all my soul about myself,” she contended.“God knows I am tired of my soul and should like to have it clean and shining once again as when I was a little girl at Kaneohe—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是你灵魂所有的腐败之处都和别人的灵魂相连，”埃布尔·阿·约一成不变地回答道，“当你有了负担，就要把它卸下来。你不能同时既承受这个负担，又摆脱它。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But all the corruption of your soul has been with other souls,” was Abel Ah Yo’s invariable reply.“When you have a burden, lay it down.You cannot bear a burden and be quit of it at the same time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我会每天向上帝祈祷，每天祈祷很多次。”她恳求，“我会谦卑地靠近上帝，带着叹息，带着泪水。我会经常向盘子里捐钱，我会买很多圣经，圣经，圣经，不停地买。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I will pray to God each day, and many times each day,” she urged.“I will approach God with humility, with sighs and with tears.I will contribute often to the plate, and I will buy Bibles, Bibles, Bibles without end.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是上帝不会向你微笑，”上帝的代言人反驳道，“而你依然会身负重担，疲惫不堪。因为你不肯说出自己的全部罪孽，除非你全都说出来，否则你哪个也摆脱不了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And God will not smile upon you,” God’s mouthpiece retorted.“And you will remain weary and heavy-laden.For you will not have told all your sin, and not until you have told all will you be rid of any.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这种重生很难，”艾丽斯叹息道，</td>
		<td class="en">“This rebirth is difficult,” Alice sighed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“重生甚至比出生还要难很多。”埃布尔·阿·约什么都做了就是不肯安慰她。“‘除非你变得和小孩一样……’”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rebirth is even more difficult than birth.”Abel Ah Yo did anything but comfort her.“‘Not until you become as a little child...’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一旦我说出来，那将会是很大的故事。”她吐露道。</td>
		<td class="en">“If ever I tell my soul, it will be a big telling,” she confided.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，说出来的理由会比这故事更重大。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The bigger the reason to tell it then.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，这情形依然是个僵局，埃布尔·阿·约要求对上帝绝对忠诚，而艾丽斯·阿卡纳在天堂的边缘摇摆着。</td>
		<td class="en">And so the situation remained at deadlock, Abel Ah Yo demanding absolute allegiance to God, and Alice Akana flirting on the fringes of paradise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“的确一旦艾丽斯开口，那将会是个很大的故事。”在海滨砂矿开采的穷老人们喝着棕榈树杜松子酒，兴高采烈地相互转告着。</td>
		<td class="en">“You bet it will be a big telling, if Alice ever begins,” the beach-combing and disreputable kamaainas (old-timers) gleefully told one another over their Palm Tree gin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在俱乐部里，艾丽斯是否会告解更重要。年轻一点的人们声称他们会在告解会上申请个前排，而许多年纪大的人们则虚伪地拿艾丽斯的皈依开玩笑。此外，艾丽斯发现自己在已经忘记她二十年的老朋友们中突然变得受欢迎了。</td>
		<td class="en">In the clubs the possibility of her telling was of more moment.The younger generation of men announced that they had applied for front seats at the telling, while many of the older generation of men joked hollowly about the conversion of Alice.Further, Alice found herself abruptly popular with friends who had forgotten her existence for twenty years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天下午，当艾丽斯手拿圣经，在旅店城堡站等着乘坐电轨车的时候，糖业生产大亨，塞勒斯·霍奇命他的司机停在她身边。不管愿不愿意，他都极其友好地请她到他的豪华轿车内，坐在他身边，并花了45分钟绕道亲自送她去目的地。</td>
		<td class="en">One afternoon, as Alice, Bible in hand, was taking the electric street car at Hotel and Fort, Cyrus Hodge, sugar factor and magnate, ordered his chauffeur to stop beside her.Willy nilly, in excess of friendliness, he had her into his limousine beside him and went three-quarters of an hour out of his way and time personally to conduct her to her destination.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真高兴见到你。”他嘟囔着说，“时间过得真快啊！你看起来不错。有保持年轻的秘诀吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good for sore eyes to see you,” he burbled.“How the years fly!You’re looking fine.The secret of youth is yours.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艾丽斯笑了，报以高贵友好的波利米西亚方式的夸赞。</td>
		<td class="en">Alice smiled and complimented in return in the royal Polynesian way of friendliness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎呀，哎呀”塞勒斯·霍奇回忆着，“当年我一个这样的男孩！”</td>
		<td class="en">“My, my,” Cyrus Hodge reminisced.“I was such a boy in those days!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“某个男孩。”她默许地笑了，</td>
		<td class="en">“SOME boy,” she laughed acquiescence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是只知道很久以前一个男孩子的愚蠢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But knowing no more than the foolishness of a boy in those long-ago days.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“记得那晚你的出租司机喝醉了，把你留在——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Remember the night your hack-driver got drunk and left you—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘘－嘘！”他警告道，“那个日本司机是个高校毕业生，比你我都更懂英语。而且，我觉得他是日本政府的间谍。那我们为什么告诉他一些事情呢？还有，我那时太年轻了。你记得……”</td>
		<td class="en">“S-s-sh!” he cautioned.“That Jap driver is a high-school graduate and knows more English than either of us.Also, I think he is a spy for his Government.So why should we tell him anything?Besides, I was so very young.You remember...”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的脸颊就像我们原过去种的桃子，在地中海果蝇还没飞进去之前的样子。”艾丽斯表示同意，“我想那时你每周刮脸不超过一次吧。你以前很帅。还记得我们原来为你编的那个草裙舞，那个——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Your cheeks were like the peaches we used to grow before the Mediterranean fruit fly got into them,” Alice agreed.“I don’t think you shaved more than once a week then.You were a pretty boy.Don’t you remember the hula we composed in your honour, the—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘘－嘘！”他让她闭嘴，“所有那些都被埋葬和忘记了。但愿没人记得！”</td>
		<td class="en">“S-s-sh!” he hushed her.“All that’s buried and forgotten.May it remain forgotten.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她注意到，在他的眼里不再有她记忆中的年轻率直。相反，他的眼神是急切的、试探的，从她那儿寻求些许保证，保证她不会说出那些埋葬了的和他有关的过去。</td>
		<td class="en">And she was aware that in his eyes was no longer any of the ingenuousness of youth she remembered.Instead, his eyes were keen and speculative, searching into her for some assurance that she would not resurrect his particular portion of that buried past.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当我们走进中年时，宗教是一个好东西。”另一位老朋友告诉她。他在太平洋的高山上建了一座漂亮的房子，刚刚娶了第二任妻子，现在正准备去轮船那儿迎接他那刚从瓦萨尔学院毕业的两个女儿。“等我们老了，我们需要宗教，艾丽斯。它温和，使我们变得更加宽容，更能容忍他人的缺点——特别是年轻时的缺点——别人年轻时的缺点，那时他们到处玩耍并不知道自己在做什么。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Religion is a good thing for us as we get along into middle age,” another old friend told her.He was building a magnificent house on Pacific Heights, but had recently married a second time, and was even then on his way to the steamer to welcome home his two daughters just graduated from Vassar.“We need religion in our old age, Alice.It softens, makes us more tolerant and forgiving of the weaknesses of others—especially the weaknesses of youth of—of others, when they played high and low and didn’t know what they were doing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他焦急地等着。</td>
		<td class="en">He waited anxiously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，”她说，“我们生下来就有罪，而且难以因成长而摆脱它。可是我在摆脱，我在摆脱。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” she said.“We are all born to sin and it is hard to grow out of sin.But I grow, I grow.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别忘了，艾丽斯，那时候我总是玩得很规矩。你我从没争吵过。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t forget, Alice, in those other days I always played square.You and I never had a falling out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“也包括你二十一岁那晚邀请我们参加草裙舞，还坚持在每次祝酒后都摔碎所有玻璃杯。当然，后来你也赔钱了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not even the night you gave that luau when you were twenty-one and insisted on breaking the glassware after every toast.But of course you paid for it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错。”他近乎乞求地肯定道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Handsomely,” he asserted almost pleadingly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很慷慨，”她表示同意，“我用你赔的钱换了餐具，数量是原来的两倍多。所以，下一次办草裙舞的时候，我摆了120个盘子，都不用找人租借一个盘子或玻璃杯。是梅因韦瑟勋爵办的草裙舞——你记得他。”</td>
