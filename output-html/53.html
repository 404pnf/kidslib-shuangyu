		<td class="en">The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar.That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago.Something was broken in my engine.And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation.I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.It said:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck.I blinked my eyes hard.I looked carefully all around me.And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him.But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但那并不是我的错。大人们在我六岁的时候打击了我对绘画生涯的热情，除了画出肚子里情形的蟒蛇和只有外部轮廓的蟒蛇，我就再也没学过画其他东西了。</td>
		<td class="en">That, however, is not my fault.The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter’s career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment.Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw.He answered me:</td></tr>
