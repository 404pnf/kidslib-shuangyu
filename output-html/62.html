		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >五月的月光明亮地照着墨菲太太的私人寄宿公寓。查阅历书可知，月光同样照着一大片地区。正是盛春时节，花粉热即将随之而来。公园里满是绿色的新叶和来自西部与南部的商旅。花朵招展，避暑胜地的代理人在招徕顾客；气候和法庭的判决都渐趋温和；四处都是手风琴声、喷泉和扑克牌游戏。</td>
		<td class="en">The May moon shone bright upon the private boarding-house of Mrs. Murphy.By reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon which its rays also fell.Spring was in its heyday, with hay fever soon to follow.The parks were green with new leaves and buyers for the Western and Southern trade.Flowers and summer-resort agents were blowing; the air and answers to Lawson were growing milder; hand-organs, fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >墨菲太太的公寓窗户是敞着的。一群房客坐在门前的高台阶上，垫着像德式煎饼的那种圆形的平垫上。</td>
		<td class="en">The windows of Mrs. Murphy’s boarding-house were open.A group of boarders were seated on the high stoop upon round, flat mats like German pancakes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >二楼一个前窗边，麦卡斯基太太在等她丈夫回家。桌上的晚饭要凉了。它的火气跑到麦卡斯基太太那里去了。</td>
		<td class="en">In one of the second-floor front windows Mrs. McCaskey awaited her husband.Supper was cooling on the table.Its heat went into Mrs. McCaskey.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >九点时麦卡斯基先生回来了。他手臂上搭着外套，嘴里叼着根烟斗，一边在房客们坐着的台阶上挑地方搁下他那双九号长D码宽的大脚，一边道歉说打扰了。</td>
		<td class="en">At nine Mr. McCaskey came.He carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his teeth; and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps as he selected spots of stone between them on which to set his size 9, width Ds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >打开房门时，他收到了一份惊喜。往常他要躲闪的不是炉盖就是马铃薯搅碎机，这次飞来的却只有话语。</td>
		<td class="en">As he opened the door of his room he received a surprise.Instead of the usual stove-lid or potato-masher for him to dodge, came only words.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基先生料想是五月善良的月光软化了妻子的心。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. McCaskey reckoned that the benign May moon had softened the breast of his spouse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我可听到了，”代替厨具的话是这么说的，“你能为笨脚踩着街上那群闲人的衣角而道歉,可你让自己的老婆在窗口等你等到脖子都有晾衣绳那么长也不见你说声‘对不起’；饭菜都凉了，你一到周六晚上就把工钱全在加勒吉店里喝光，今天收煤气账的都来两回了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I heard ye,” came the oral substitutes for kitchenware.“Ye can apollygise to riff-raff of the streets for settin’ yer unhandy feet on the tails of their frocks, but ye’d walk on the neck of yer wife the length of a clothes-line without so much as a ‘Kiss me fut,’ and I’m sure it’s that long from rubberin’ out the windy for ye and the victuals cold such as there’s money to buy after drinkin’ up yer wages at Gallegher’s every Saturday evenin’, and the gas man here twice to-day for his.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“女人！”麦卡斯基把外套和帽子往椅子上一丢，说道，“你吵得我快没胃口了。你贬低礼貌就是拆社会基础的墙脚。要从挡道的太太们中间穿过，说声借光只是绅士本分。你能不能从窗口收回你那张猪脸去热菜啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Woman!” said Mr. McCaskey, dashing his coat and hat upon a chair, “the noise of ye is an insult to me appetite.When ye run down politeness ye take the mortar from between the bricks of the foundations of society.’Tis no more than exercisin’ the acrimony of a gentleman when ye ask the dissent of ladies blockin’ the way for steppin’ between them.Will ye bring the pig’s face of ye out of the windy and see to the food?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基太太猛地起身走向炉子。她不太对劲的样子使麦卡斯基先生心生警觉。她的嘴角突然像气压表那样往下一沉时，往往预示着锅碗瓢盆的砸落。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. McCaskey arose heavily and went to the stove.There was something in her manner that warned Mr. McCaskey.When the corners of her mouth went down suddenly like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of crockery and tinware.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“猪脸，是吗？”麦卡斯基太太说着，把一只装满咸肉萝卜的炖锅猛掷向她丈夫。</td>
		<td class="en">“Pig’s face, is it?” said Mrs. McCaskey, and hurled a stewpan full of bacon and turnips at her lord.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基可是个机敏的老手了。他知道头盘完了下一道是什么。桌上有一盘配着酢浆草的烤猪里脊。他端起这盘反击，招来一个盛在陶碟里的面包布丁。丈夫准确地把一大片瑞士奶酪打在麦卡斯基太太的一只眼睛下方。当她用一只装满滚烫微香黑咖啡的咖啡壶精准地还击时，按照上菜规矩，这场战役也该结束了。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. McCaskey was no novice at repartee.He knew what should follow the entrée.On the table was a roast sirloin of pork, garnished with shamrocks.He retorted with this, and drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish.A hunk of Swiss cheese accurately thrown by her husband struck Mrs. McCaskey below one eye.When she replied with a well-aimed coffee-pot full of a hot, black, semi-fragrant liquid the battle, according to courses, should have ended.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但麦卡斯基先生不是那种只吃五十美分客餐的人。让小气的波西米亚人把咖啡当作结尾吧，如果他们愿意。让他们出丑去吧。他可更狡猾。他不是没用过洗指碗。虽然墨菲太太的公寓里没有，但它们的代用品就在他手边。他得意地把搪瓷脸盆往欢喜冤家的头上一送。麦卡斯基太太及时闪开了。她伸手去抓熨斗，希望用这甘露酒结束这场美食大战。但这时楼下传来的高声尖叫令她和麦卡斯基先生都不由自主休了战。</td>
		<td class="en">But Mr. McCaskey was no 50-cent table d’hôter.Let cheap Bohemians consider coffee the end, if they would.Let them make that faux pas.He was foxier still.Finger-bowls were not beyond the compass of his experience.They were not to be had in the Pension Murphy; but their equivalent was at hand.Triumphantly he sent the granite-ware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary.Mrs. McCaskey dodged in time.She reached for a flatiron, with which, as a sort of cordial, she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close.But a loud, wailing scream downstairs caused both her and Mr. McCaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >警察克利里站在房子拐角处的人行道上，竖着一只耳朵听家庭餐具的碰撞声。</td>
		<td class="en">On the sidewalk at the corner of the house Policeman Cleary was standing with one ear upturned, listening to the crash of household utensils.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是约翰·麦卡斯基和他太太又在开战了，”警察寻思着，“我到底要不要上去劝劝？我还是别去了。他们是夫妻，平时也没什么娱乐。这不会闹很久的。当然，如果要继续的话，他们得多借点餐具。”</td>
		<td class="en">“’Tis Jawn McCaskey and his missis at it again,” meditated the policeman.“I wonder shall I go up and stop the row.I will not.Married folks they are; and few pleasures they have.’Twill not last long.Sure, they’ll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在那时，楼下传来了那高声的尖叫，这意味着出了恐怖或悲惨的事。“也许是猫。”警察克利里说道，匆忙往另一个方向走开了。</td>
		<td class="en">And just then came the loud scream below-stairs, betokening fear or dire extremity.“’Tis probably the cat,” said Policeman Cleary, and walked hastily in the other direction.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >台阶上的房客们紧张了起来。天生是当保险公司掮客的料，又以调查研究为职的图米先生走进屋去探听尖叫声是怎么回事。回来时他报信说，墨菲太太家的小男孩不见了。跟在报信者后蹦出来的是墨菲太太——眼泪汪汪，歇斯底里，因失去她那重三十磅，满脸雀斑又调皮捣蛋的儿子而哭天喊地。矫揉造作，是的；可图米先生在女帽商珀迪小姐边坐下，他们同情地握起手来。沃尔什姐妹，那两位每日抱怨走廊太吵的老佣人，立刻询问有没有人在钟座后找过。</td>
		<td class="en">The boarders on the steps were fluttered.Mr. Toomey, an insurance solicitor by birth and an investigator by profession, went inside to analyse the scream.He returned with the news that Mrs. Murphy’s little boy, Mike, was lost.Following the messenger, out bounced Mrs. Murphy—two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics, clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief.Bathos, truly; but Mr. Toomey sat down at the side of Miss Purdy, millinery, and their hands came together in sympathy.The two old maids, Misses Walsh, who complained every day about the noise in the halls, inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >和他的胖太太坐在最上面那级石阶的格里格陆军少校站了起来，扣好外套。“小家伙丢了？”他叫道，“我走遍城里去找。”他太太从不准他天黑后出去。但现在她却用男中音的嗓音说道：“去吧，卢多维克！”“谁能坐视那位悲痛母亲而不跳出来为她分忧的就是铁石心肠。”“亲爱的，给我三十美分——要不六十美分吧，”少校说，“迷路的孩子有时会走得很远。我可能需要车费。”</td>
		<td class="en">Major Grigg, who sat by his fat wife on the top step, arose and buttoned his coat.“The little one lost?” he exclaimed.“I will scour the city.”His wife never allowed him out after dark.But now she said: “Go, Ludovic!” in a baritone voice.“Whoever can look upon that mother’s grief without springing to her relief has a heart of stone.”“Give me some thirty or—sixty cents, my love,” said the Major.“Lost children sometimes stray far.I may need carfares.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >住在四楼后头大厅里的丹尼老头坐在最低那级石阶上，正试着借街灯的光看报，他翻了一页，继续看关于木匠罢工的报道。墨菲太太对着月亮哀嚎：“噢，啊，迈克，天哪，我的小迈克到底在哪儿啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">Old man Denny, hall room, fourth floor back, who sat on the lowest step, trying to read a paper by the street lamp, turned over a page to follow up the article about the carpenters’ strike.Mrs. Murphy shrieked to the moon: “Oh, ar-r-Mike, f’r Gawd’s sake, where is me little bit av a boy?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你最后一次见到他是什么时候？”丹尼老头问道，一只眼睛还在看建筑联合会的报告。</td>
		<td class="en">“When’d ye see him last?” asked old man Denny, with one eye on the report of the Building Trades League.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，”墨菲太太恸哭着，“昨天吧，也许是四小时前！我不知道。但他准丢了，我的小迈克啊。他今早还在人行道上玩呢——还是星期三？我太忙了，没法记着日子。但我把整栋房子上上下下都找过了，他不见了。噢，老天哪——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh,” wailed Mrs. Murphy, “’twas yisterday, or maybe four hours ago!I dunno.But it’s lost he is, me little boy Mike.He was playin’ on the sidewalk only this mornin’—or was it Wednesday?I’m that busy with work, ’tis hard to keep up with dates.But I’ve looked the house over from top to cellar, and it’s gone he is.Oh, for the love av Hiven—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >无论人们如何谩骂，但这座大城市始终是沉默、冷酷而庞大的。人们说它铁石心肠；人们说它胸膛中没有跳动着同情的脉搏；人们把它的街道比作孤寂森林和熔岩沙漠。但在龙虾的硬壳下还能找到美味可口的食物呢。也许换个比喻会更明智吧。不过没人会介意的。要是那人没有足够多且有用的爪子，我们可不会称他为龙虾。</td>
		<td class="en">Silent, grim, colossal, the big city has ever stood against its revilers.They call it hard as iron; they say that no pulse of pity beats in its bosom; they compare its streets with lonely forests and deserts of lava.But beneath the hard crust of the lobster is found a delectable and luscious food.Perhaps a different simile would have been wiser.Still, nobody should take offence.We would call no one a lobster without good and sufficient claws.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没有任何灾难比一个小孩走丢更能触动人心了。他们的双足是如此迟疑无力；世道却是那般险峻陌生。</td>
		<td class="en">No calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a little child.Their feet are so uncertain and feeble; the ways are so steep and strange.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格里格少校匆匆过了拐角，走上大街，走进了比利的店。“给我一杯高度黑麦威士忌，”他对伙计说，“你有没在这附近见过一个六岁的走失的小孩，罗圈腿，脸脏兮兮的？”</td>
		<td class="en">Major Griggs hurried down to the corner, and up the avenue into Billy’s place.“Gimme a rye-high,” he said to the servitor.“Haven’t seen a bow-legged, dirty-faced little devil of a six-year-old lost kid around here anywhere, have you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >图米先生仍坐在石阶上握着珀迪小姐的手。“想想那个小家伙”，珀迪小姐说，“从妈妈身边走丢——也许已经倒在奔马的铁蹄下了——噢，那不是很可怕？”</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Toomey retained Miss Purdy’s hand on the steps.“Think of that dear little babe,” said Miss Purdy, “lost from his mother’s side—perhaps already fallen beneath the iron hoofs of galloping steeds—oh, isn’t it dreadful?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可不是吗？”图米先生表示赞同，握紧了她的手，“我这就出发去帮忙找他吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ain’t that right?” agreed Mr. Toomey, squeezing her hand.“Say I start out and help look for um!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“也许吧，”珀迪小姐说，“你是应该去。但是，噢，图米先生，你这样劲头十足——这样不顾一切——如果你出于热心遇到了什么意外，那怎么办——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Perhaps,” said Miss Purdy, “you should.But, oh, Mr. Toomey, you are so dashing—so reckless—suppose in your enthusiasm some accident should befall you, then what—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >丹尼老头用手指着，一句一句地继续看着仲裁协定。</td>
		<td class="en">Old man Denny read on about the arbitration agreement, with one finger on the lines.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >二楼前边，麦卡斯基先生和太太走到窗前歇了口气。麦卡斯基先生正弯着食指抠出背心里的萝卜，他太太则正在揉那只被烤猪肉的盐分弄得很是难受的眼睛。他们听到楼下的尖叫，就挤着探出头瞧瞧。</td>
		<td class="en">In the second floor front Mr. and Mrs. McCaskey came to the window to recover their second wind.Mr. McCaskey was scooping turnips out of his vest with a crooked forefinger, and his lady was wiping an eye that the salt of the roast pork had not benefited.They heard the outcry below, and thrust their heads out of the window.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是小迈克丢了，”麦卡斯基太太低声地说，“那个漂亮又爱捣蛋的小天使！”</td>
		<td class="en">“’Tis little Mike is lost,” said Mrs. McCaskey, in a hushed voice, “the beautiful, little, trouble-making angel of a gossoon!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是一个男孩走丢了？”麦卡斯基先生把身子探出窗说道。“哎呀，那实在够糟糕的。男孩丢了可不一样。如果丢的是个女人我倒乐意，因为她们走了就清净了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The bit of a boy mislaid?” said Mr. McCaskey, leaning out of the window.“Why, now, that’s bad enough, entirely.The childer, they be different.If ’twas a woman I’d be willin’, for they leave peace behind ’em when they go.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基太太不理会这话带刺，抓住了他的胳膊。</td>
		<td class="en">Disregarding the thrust, Mrs. McCaskey caught her husband’s arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“约翰，”她深情唤道，“墨菲太太的小孩儿不见了。这城市太大，小孩儿容易走失。他才六岁。约翰，如果我们六年前生一个，我们的小孩儿现在也这么大了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Jawn,” she said, sentimentally, “Missis Murphy’s little bye is lost.’Tis a great city for losing little boys.Six years old he was.Jawn, ’tis the same age our little bye would have been if we had had one six years ago.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们从来没生过。”麦卡斯基先生细细想了想事实。</td>
		<td class="en">“We never did,” said Mr. McCaskey, lingering with the fact.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但如果我们生过呢,约翰，想想如果我们的小费伦偷跑出去，迷失在城市的某个角落，我们今晚心里会多悲痛啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But if we had, Jawn, think what sorrow would be in our hearts this night, with our little Phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres at all.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你说什么傻话啊，”麦卡斯基先生说。“他会叫帕特，和我那住在坎特里的老爸的名字一样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ye talk foolishness,” said Mr. McCaskey.“’Tis Pat he would be named, after me old father in Cantrim.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你胡说！”麦卡斯基太太说道，并没有怒气。“我哥哥抵得上十打在泥潭里的麦卡斯基。孩子要用他的名字。”她倾身靠在窗台，看着下面的忙乱。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ye lie!” said Mrs. McCaskey, without anger.“Me brother was worth tin dozen bog-trotting McCaskeys.After him would the bye be named.”She leaned over the window-sill and looked down at the hurrying and bustle below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“约翰，”麦卡斯基太太温柔地说，“抱歉，我对你太急躁了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Jawn,” said Mrs. McCaskey, softly, “I’m sorry I was hasty wid ye.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“正如你说的，”她丈夫说，“急躁的布丁，匆忙的萝卜，还有撵人的咖啡。你可以管这叫一客快餐，没错，这是实话。”</td>
		<td class="en">“’Twas hasty puddin’, as ye say,” said her husband, “and hurry-up turnips and get-a-move-on-ye coffee.’Twas what ye could call a quick lunch, all right, and tell no lie.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基太太伸手勾住丈夫的胳膊，握住他粗糙的手。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. McCaskey slipped her arm inside her husband’s and took his rough hand in hers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听听可怜的墨菲太太的哭声，”她说，“一个丁点儿大的小男孩在这么大的城市里走丢是件多么可怕的事啊。如果换作我们的小费伦，约翰，我的心都要碎了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Listen at the cryin’ of poor Mrs. Murphy,” she said.“’Tis an awful thing for a bit of a bye to be lost in this great big city.If ’twas our little Phelan, Jawn, I’d be breakin’ me heart.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基先生局促地抽回了手。不过他把手搭在妻子靠近他的那边肩膀上。</td>
		<td class="en">Awkwardly Mr. McCaskey withdrew his hand.But he laid it around the nearing shoulder of his wife.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这话太荒唐了，”他粗鲁地说，“但如果我们的小帕特被绑架或什么的，我也会很难过的。但我们根本没有生过孩子。有时我对你很刻薄冷酷，朱迪。别放在心上。”</td>
		<td class="en">“’Tis foolishness, of course,” said he, roughly, “but I’d be cut up some meself if our little Pat was kidnapped or anything.But there never was any childer for us.Sometimes I’ve been ugly and hard with ye, Judy.Forget it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们依偎着，看着下面正在上演的揪心剧情。</td>
		<td class="en">They leaned together, and looked down at the heart-drama being acted below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们这样久久坐着。人们沿着人行道涌来，凑一块儿打听消息，空气里满是谣言和不合逻辑的猜度。墨菲太太在其中来回费力地穿行,像一座挂着哗啦啦泪瀑的肉山。送信人来来去去。</td>
		<td class="en">Long they sat thus.People surged along the sidewalk, crowding, questioning, filling the air with rumours, and inconsequent surmises.Mrs. Murphy ploughed back and forth in their midst, like a soft mountain down which plunged an audible cataract of tears.Couriers came and went.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >公寓前又有喧闹声响起，新的骚动出现了。</td>
		<td class="en">Loud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the boarding-house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在怎么回事，朱迪？”麦卡斯基先生问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s up now, Judy?” asked Mr. McCaskey.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是墨菲太太的声音，”麦卡斯基太太说道，细细听着，“她说她发现小迈克在她房间床底一卷旧油毡后睡着了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“’Tis Missis Murphy’s voice,” said Mrs. McCaskey, harking.“She says she’s after finding little Mike asleep behind the roll of old linoleum under the bed in her room.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基先生放声大笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. McCaskey laughed loudly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那就是你的费伦，”他讽刺地大声说道，“要是帕特，才不会耍那花招。如果我们那根本不存在的儿子走丢了被拐了，尽管叫他费伦好了，看他像条小癞皮狗一样躲在床底下。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s yer Phelan,” he shouted, sardonically.“Divil a bit would a Pat have done that trick.If the bye we never had is strayed and stole, by the powers, call him Phelan, and see him hide out under the bed like a mangy pup.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麦卡斯基太太艰难地站了起来，走向碗柜，嘴角耷拉着。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. McCaskey arose heavily, and went toward the dish closet, with the corners of her mouth drawn down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人群散后，警察克利里才从拐角处回来。他朝麦卡斯基家竖起一只耳朵听了听，吃惊地听到铁器瓷器的撞击声，摔厨具的声音似乎和先前一样响。警察克利里掏出他的表。</td>
		<td class="en">Policeman Cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed.Surprised, he upturned an ear toward the McCaskey apartment, where the crash of irons and chinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before.Policeman Cleary took out his timepiece.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的天哪！”他惊叹道，“照表上看，约翰·麦卡斯基已经同他太太打了一小时又十五分钟了。他太太比他重了四十磅呢。但愿他加把劲儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“By the deported snakes!” he exclaimed, “Jawn McCaskey and his lady have been fightin’ for an hour and a quarter by the watch.The missis could give him forty pounds weight.Strength to his arm.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >警察克利里逛回拐角去了。</td>
		<td class="en">Policeman Cleary strolled back around the corner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >丹尼老头折起报纸赶忙跑上台阶，墨菲太太要关门过夜了。</td>
		<td class="en">Old man Denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as Mrs. Murphy was about to lock the door for the night.</td></tr>
