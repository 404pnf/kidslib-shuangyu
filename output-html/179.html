		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一颗狼一样的脑袋把帐篷的门帘顶到了一边，脑袋上的毛都结了一层白霜，眼中带着渴求的目光。</td>
		<td class="en">A wolfish head, wistful-eyed and frost-rimed, thrust aside the tent-flaps.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨！去！锡沃斯！去，你这坏家伙！”帐篷里的人齐声抗议道。贝特斯拿一块镀锡铁皮对着狗猛敲，狗急忙缩回了脑袋。路易斯·萨沃伊重新固定好帐篷门帘，又把一只煎锅踢翻，用它顶着门帘底部，之后暖了暖手。帐篷外面太冷了。两天两夜过去了，温度降到零下68度的时候，酒精温度计就爆裂了。自那之后，天气一天比一天寒冷刺骨。谁也不知道这段寒冷天气什么时候才会结束。在这样的时候，除非是迫不得已，否则没人愿意远离火炉，或去多呼吸一口不必要的冷空气。间或也有人会干这样的事，于是有时就会把自己的肺冻着了。结果便会导致断断续续的干咳，煎熏肉时发作得尤其厉害。那之后，在春日或夏日，在某个地方，有人就会在冻住的淤泥地上烧出一个洞。接着，这人把一具男人的尸体扔进洞里，在上面盖上苔藓后再离开，确信这样一来，冰凉的躯体就能保持完好，在末日审判到来时顺利复活。对于那些没有信仰、怀疑世界末日那天肉体没法复活的人，克朗代克真是再合适不过的长眠之地。不过，也不能就此推断这里是个适宜生存的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hi! Chook! Siwash! Chook, you limb of Satan!” chorused the protesting inmates.Bettles rapped the dog sharply with a tin plate, and it withdrew hastily.Louis Savoy refastened the flaps, kicked a frying-pan over against the bottom, and warmed his hands.It was very cold without.Forty-eight hours gone, the spirit thermometer had burst at sixty-eight below, and since that time it had grown steadily and bitterly colder.There was no telling when the snap would end.And it is poor policy, unless the gods will it, to venture far from a stove at such times, or to increase the quantity of cold atmosphere one must breathe.Men sometimes do it, and sometimes they chill their lungs.This leads up to a dry, hacking cough, noticeably irritable when bacon is being fried.After that, somewhere along in the spring or summer, a hole is burned in the frozen muck.Into this a man’s carcass is dumped, covered over with moss, and left with the assurance that it will rise on the crack of Doom, wholly and frigidly intact.For those of little faith, sceptical of material integration on that fateful day, no fitter country than the Klondike can be recommended to die in.But it is not to be inferred from this that it is a fit country for living purposes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外面很冷，帐篷里面也并不太暖和。唯一勉强称得上家具的东西就是那个火炉，而人们也毫不掩饰对它的偏爱。地上有一半地方都盖着大松枝；松枝上铺着用来睡觉的毛皮，下面则是冬天的积雪。剩下的地方全是塞在“莫卡辛”鞋里的雪，上面散放着坛坛罐罐，还有些北极帐篷里常见的杂七杂八的东西。尽管炉子烧得又红又烫，仅仅三英尺开外的地方却放着一块冰，棱角分明，干燥得就像刚从溪谷挖出来似的。外面的冷气压迫使帐篷里的热量向上流动。就在火炉正上方，也就是烟囱伸入帐顶的地方，是一小圈干燥的帆布；往下，通常以烟囱为中心，是一圈冒着热气的帆布；再往下是一个潮湿的、渗着水的圆圈。此外，帐篷剩下的部分，包括侧壁和顶棚，都罩着一层半寸厚的霜，又干又白，表面亮晶晶的。</td>
		<td class="en">It was very cold without, but it was not over-warm within.The only article which might be designated furniture was the stove, and for this the men were frank in displaying their preference.Upon half of the floor pine boughs had been cast; above this were spread the sleeping-furs, beneath lay the winter’s snowfall.The remainder of the floor was moccasin-packed snow, littered with pots and pans and the general impedimenta of an Arctic camp.The stove was red and roaring hot, but only a bare three feet away lay a block of ice, as sharp-edged and dry as when first quarried from the creek bottom.The pressure of the outside cold forced the inner heat upward.Just above the stove, where the pipe penetrated the roof, was a tiny circle of dry canvas; next, with the pipe always as centre, a circle of steaming canvas; next a damp and moisture-exuding ring; and finally, the rest of the tent, sidewalls and top, coated with a half-inch of dry, white, crystal-encrusted frost.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉哟！唉哟！唉哟！一个年轻小伙子，留着胡子，苍白憔悴，正躺在毛皮上面睡觉，发出一阵阵痛苦的呻吟；人还没有醒，呻吟的声音却渐渐高起来，痛得也更厉害了。他的身子半离开毯子，痉挛般地颤抖、抽搐起来，仿佛试图从一床荨麻上坐起身来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh! OH! OH!A young fellow, lying asleep in the furs, bearded and wan and weary, raised a moan of pain, and without waking increased the pitch and intensity of his anguish.His body half-lifted from the blankets, and quivered and shrank spasmodically, as though drawing away from a bed of nettles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“给他翻个身！”贝特斯吩咐道，“他在抽筋。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Roll’m over!” ordered Bettles.“He’s crampin’.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，出于好心，六个同伴毫不留情地迅速把他压回毯子，给他翻了个身，又重重锤了他一顿。</td>
		<td class="en">And thereat, with pitiless good-will, he was pitched upon and rolled and thumped and pounded by half-a-dozen willing comrades.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这该死的路，”小伙子轻声嘟囔着，掀开盖毯坐起身来，“我跑遍了整个国家，大半年都没停歇，用各种方法把自己的身板练强了，然后辛辛苦苦跑到这个鬼地方来，发现自个儿娇气得像个雅典人，没有一点儿男人的样子！”他弯着身子靠近火，卷了一根烟。“唉，我可不是发牢骚。我活该遭罪，活该，就是觉得自个儿挺丢人的，没别的意思。我走了三十英里烂路，到了这儿，筋疲力尽，浑身又僵又酸，就像个在乡村公路上走了五英里的娇小姐一样瘫掉了。呸！简直恶心死我了！有火柴没？”“消消气，年轻人。”贝特斯把火柴递给他，用长辈的语气说道，“你得知道怎么适应新环境。这算什么遭罪！我难道不记得我第一次怎么走这条路的！全身僵硬？有一次我把嘴凑到冰窟窿喝水，起身就花了十分钟——每个关节都嘎吱作响，疼得要死。抽筋？遇上抽筋的问题，整个帐篷的伙计得花上半天捶我，我才会好。你这个年轻人，算不错了，精力好。每年这个时候都来一趟，你早晚都会超过我们这些老骨头的。你最大的优势就是身上没什么肥肉，很多大块头正是因为肥肉太多，早早地就去了天堂。</td>
		<td class="en">“Damn the trail,” he muttered softly, as he threw off the robes and sat up.“I’ve run across country, played quarter three seasons hand-running, and hardened myself in all manner of ways; and then I pilgrim it into this God-forsaken land and find myself an effeminate Athenian without the simplest rudiments of manhood!”He hunched up to the fire and rolled a cigarette.“Oh, I’m not whining.I can take my medicine all right, all right; but I’m just decently ashamed of myself, that’s all.Here I am, on top of a dirty thirty miles, as knocked up and stiff and sore as a pink-tea degenerate after a five-mile walk on a country turn-pike.Bah! It makes me sick!Got a match?”“Don’t git the tantrums, youngster.”Bettles passed over the required fire-stick and waxed patriarchal.“Ye’ve gotter ’low some for the breakin’-in.Sufferin’ cracky! don’t I recollect the first time I hit the trail!Stiff?I’ve seen the time it’d take me ten minutes to git my mouth from the waterhole an’ come to my feet—every jint crackin’ an’ kickin’ fit to kill.Cramp?In sech knots it’d take the camp half a day to untangle me.You’re all right, for a cub, any ye’ve the true sperrit.Come this day year, you’ll walk all us old bucks into the ground any time.An’ best in your favor, you hain’t got that streak of fat in your make-up which has sent many a husky man to the bosom of Abraham afore his right and proper time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“肥肉？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Streak of fat?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错。就是说块头大。走这条路，可不是块头越大越好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yep. Comes along of bulk.’T ain’t the big men as is the best when it comes to the trail.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从来没听说过。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Never heard of it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没听说过，真的？得了，这可是绝对可靠又明显的事实，我可不是唬人。大块头使起劲来再厉害不过，不过要论耐力可就不怎么样了，大块头往往耐力很差。而那些小个儿、瘦长结实的家伙，他们认真干起来，就像瘦骨嶙峋的狗咬定一块骨头一样，丝毫不放松。唉，这些个煎熬，大个子可受不了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Never heered of it, eh?Well, it’s a dead straight, open-an’-shut fact, an’ no gittin’ round.Bulk’s all well enough for a mighty big effort, but ’thout stayin’ powers it ain’t worth a continental whoop; an’ stayin’ powers an’ bulk ain’t runnin’ mates.Takes the small, wiry fellows when it comes to gittin’ right down an’ hangin’ on like a lean-jowled dog to a bone.Why, hell’s fire, the big men they ain’t in it!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老天爷作证！”路易斯·萨沃伊插话说，“那可不是——用你们的话说——那可不是开玩笑的！”我认识一个人，壮得像头水牛。大家一窝蜂似的去萨尔弗溪的时候，他和一个小个子朗·麦克范一道走。你们认识朗·麦克范吧，那个小个子爱尔兰人，头发红红的，总爱咧着嘴笑。他们走啊，走啊，走啊，走了整整一天一夜。大个子呢，累极了，就躺在雪地上了。小个子踢他，他就哭，哭得像什么来着——啊！像你们说的，活像个小娃娃似的。小个子踢啊，踢啊，踢啊，踢了好长一段时间，好长一段路，才慢慢把那个大个子踢到我的小屋里。三天过后，那大个子才从我家毯子上爬起来。我还没见过像他这么娘们儿气的大个子呢。从来没见过。他活脱脱就是一堆肥肉。没错。”</td>
		<td class="en">“By gar!” broke in Louis Savoy, “dat is no, vot you call, josh!I know one mans, so vaire beeg like ze buffalo.Wit him, on ze Sulphur Creek stampede, go one small mans, Lon McFane.You know dat Lon McFane, dat leetle Irisher wit ze red hair and ze grin.An’ dey walk an’ walk an’ walk, all ze day long an’ ze night long.And beeg mans, him become vaire tired, an’ lay down mooch in ze snow.And leetle mans keek beeg mans, an’ him cry like, vot you call—ah! vot you call ze kid.And leetle mans keek an’ keek an’ keek, an’ bime by, long time, long way, keek beeg mans into my cabin.Tree days ’fore him crawl out my blankets.Nevaire I see beeg squaw like him.No nevaire.Him haf vot you call ze streak of fat.You bet.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过，别忘了还有个阿克塞尔·冈德森。”普林斯开口道。那位伟大的斯堪的纳维亚人，以及那些影射他死亡的悲剧事件，曾给这位采矿工程师留下了很深的印象。“他就长眠在那儿，某个地方。”他手一挥，朝神秘的东方草草一指。</td>
		<td class="en">“But there was Axel Gunderson,” Prince spoke up.The great Scandinavian, with the tragic events which shadowed his passing, had made a deep mark on the mining engineer.“He lies up there, somewhere.”He swept his hand in the vague direction of the mysterious east.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在那些到过海边的或者全凭毅力猎到过一只麋鹿的人当中，就数他个头最大。”贝特斯补充道，“不过他可是绝对的例外。你看看他的女人，恩卡——才一百一十磅，精瘦，一点儿赘肉也没有。她胆量过人，堪比他体内的全部勇气之和；她陪伴着他，想尽办法让他变得更加优秀。天上飞的、地上跑的、水里游的，没什么她搞不定的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Biggest man that ever turned his heels to Salt Water, or run a moose down with sheer grit,” supplemented Bettles; “but he’s the prove-the-rule exception.Look at his woman, Unga,—tip the scales at a hundred an’ ten, clean meat an’ nary ounce to spare.She’d bank grit ’gainst his for all there was in him, an’ see him, an’ go him better if it was possible.Nothing over the earth, or in it, or under it, she wouldn’t ’a’ done.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可她爱他。”工程师反驳道。</td>
		<td class="en">“But she loved him,” objected the engineer.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“’T ain’t that.It—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“瞧你们说的，兄弟们，”坐在粮柜子上的赛特卡·查利插嘴道，“你们刚刚提到大个子肌肉里藏着的肥肉，提到女人的毅力和爱，你们都说得没错。不过，我倒是想起了这块土地刚开荒那会儿，人烟还像星星一样稀少时发生的一些事情。也就是在那时，我跟一个大个子男人，就是一堆肥肉的那种，还有一个女人有了瓜葛。这个女人个子小小的，可她的心比男人牛一样的心脏还要强大，她真有毅力。我们一路劳累奔波，甚至走到了海边。天气寒冷刺骨，积雪又深，我们都饿得要命。这个女人的爱是伟大的——没有比这更好的说法了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Look you, brothers,” broke in Sitka Charley from his seat on the grub-box.“Ye have spoken of the streak of fat that runs in big men’s muscles, of the grit of women and the love, and ye have spoken fair; but I have in mind things which happened when the land was young and the fires of men apart as the stars.It was then I had concern with a big man, and a streak of fat, and a woman.And the woman was small; but her heart was greater than the beef-heart of the man, and she had grit.And we traveled a weary trail, even to the Salt Water, and the cold was bitter, the snow deep, the hunger great.And the woman’s love was a mighty love—no more can man say than this.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他停顿了一下，用一把短柄小斧子将冰一片片地从他身旁的大冰块上削下来。他把这些碎冰扔进火炉上的金黄色锅里，融化成饮用水。大伙儿靠得更近了些，那个刚才抽筋的人也想让僵硬的身体更舒服些，却没什么效果。</td>
		<td class="en">He paused, and with the hatchet broke pieces of ice from the large chunk beside him.These he threw into the gold pan on the stove, where the drinking-water thawed.The men drew up closer, and he of the cramps sought greater comfort vainly for his stiffened body.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“兄弟们，我流的是锡沃斯人鲜红的血，我的心却是向着白人的。血脉是父辈们传下来的，改变不了，但因为朋友们良好品格的影响，我的心却向着白人。我还是小男孩的时候，就明白一个重要的道理。我明白这块土地属于你们，属于你们这一族；锡沃斯人无法抵抗你们，只会像驯鹿和熊一样，必定在寒冷中灭绝。所以我来到这暖和的地方，坐到你们中间，坐到你们的火堆旁。瞧，我变成了你们中的一员，我一辈子见过的事也算多了。我遇到过各种奇奇怪怪的事情，在大路上和各色人等打过交道。有了这些经历，我学着像你们一样观察事情、观察人，以及思考问题。所以，我要是对你们的一个同族说了狠话，我知道你们不会见怪；我要是称赞了我的一个族人，你们也不会贸然说：‘赛特卡·查利是锡沃斯人，他的眼神狡猾，话不可信。’是不是？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Brothers, my blood is red with Siwash, but my heart is white.To the faults of my fathers I owe the one, to the virtues of my friends the other.A great truth came to me when I was yet a boy.I learned that to your kind and you was given the earth; that the Siwash could not withstand you, and like the caribou and the bear, must perish in the cold.So I came into the warm and sat among you, by your fires, and behold, I became one of you, I have seen much in my time.I have known strange things, and bucked big, on big trails, with men of many breeds.And because of these things, I measure deeds after your manner, and judge men, and think thoughts.Wherefore, when I speak harshly of one of your own kind, I know you will not take it amiss; and when I speak high of one of my father’s people, you will not take it upon you to say, ‘Sitka Charley is Siwash, and there is a crooked light in his eyes and small honor to his tongue.’ Is it not so?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >四周的人都从嗓子眼里发出声音，表示赞同。</td>
		<td class="en">Deep down in throat, the circle vouchsafed its assent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个女人叫帕苏克。我通过公平交易，从她的族人那里买了她，他们住在海岸边，他们民族的契尔凯特图腾就矗立在一座咸水海湾的岬角处。我当时没留意这个女人，也没看清她的模样。因为她很少将视线从地面上移开，看上去羞怯又害怕。女孩们突然被推到一个素未谋面的陌生人怀里时，就会这样。就像我说的，我心里没有地方容得下她，因为我一心想着一次重要的征程，需要一个人替我喂狗，和我一起划桨，挨过渡河那些漫长的日子。两个人可以合盖一条毯子，所以我选择帕苏克同行。</td>
		<td class="en">“The woman was Passuk.I got her in fair trade from her people, who were of the Coast and whose Chilcat totem stood at the head of a salt arm of the sea.My heart did not go out to the woman, nor did I take stock of her looks.For she scarce took her eyes from the ground, and she was timid and afraid, as girls will be when cast into a stranger’s arms whom they have never seen before.As I say, there was no place in my heart for her to creep, for I had a great journey in mind, and stood in need of one to feed my dogs and to lift a paddle with me through the long river days.One blanket would cover the twain; so I chose Passuk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是不是没说我当时是替政府办事？如果没提过，你们知道就好。于是我带上雪橇、狗和干粮登上了一艘战舰，和我一起走的还有帕苏克。我们朝北走，到达那已经被冬天冰封的白令海边，在那里登陆——我、帕苏克，还有那些狗。我身上还带着从政府领的钱，因为我是它的雇员，带着无人涉足过的大陆的地图，还有一些信。这些信件封了蜡，被巧妙地施加了能抵御这恶劣天气的保护措施。我要把它们送到被困在大马更些河冰块中的北极捕鲸船上。除了我们自己的众河之母——育空河，我可从没见过像这么大的一条河。</td>
		<td class="en">“Have I not said I was a servant to the Government?If not, it is well that ye know.So I was taken on a warship, sleds and dogs and evaporated foods, and with me came Passuk.And we went north, to the winter ice-rim of Bering Sea, where we were landed,—myself, and Passuk, and the dogs.I was also given moneys of the Government, for I was its servant, and charts of lands which the eyes of man had never dwelt upon, and messages.These messages were sealed, and protected shrewdly from the weather, and I was to deliver them to the whale-ships of the Arctic, ice-bound by the great Mackenzie.Never was there so great a river, forgetting only our own Yukon, the Mother of all Rivers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这些都是闲话，因为我的故事和捕鲸船无关，也和我在马更些河畔度过的那个冰封的冬天无关。后来到了春天，白天变长，大雪消融得只剩一层又薄又硬的冰，帕苏克和我开始向南走，前往育空地区。那是一次让人筋疲力尽的旅行，好在太阳为我们指明了前进的道路。就像我说的，那时这里还是一片荒芜，我们用棍杖和船桨同激流奋战，终于抵达了四十英里站。再次见到白人的脸孔真让人高兴，我们也就上了岸。那个冬天不好过。黑暗和寒冷降临，随之而来的还有饥荒。公司的代理人给每个人发了四十磅面粉，二十磅熏肉。没有豆子。狗哀嚎个不停，随处可见饿得扁扁的肚子和满是皱纹的脸，强壮的人变得虚弱，虚弱的人死了。坏血病也在肆虐横行。</td>
		<td class="en">“All of which is neither here nor there, for my story deals not with the whale-ships, nor the berg-bound winter I spent by the Mackenzie.Afterward, in the spring, when the days lengthened and there was a crust to the snow, we came south, Passuk and I, to the Country of the Yukon.A weary journey, but the sun pointed out the way of our feet.It was a naked land then, as I have said, and we worked up the current, with pole and paddle, till we came to Forty Mile.Good it was to see white faces once again, so we put into the bank.And that winter was a hard winter.The darkness and the cold drew down upon us, and with them the famine.To each man the agent of the Company gave forty pounds of flour and twenty of bacon.There were no beans.And, the dogs howled always, and there were flat bellies and deep-lined faces, and strong men became weak, and weak men died.There was also much scurvy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“后来有一晚，我们一起走进一家店铺，货架全都空空的，让我们觉得肚子更空了。我们就着火光低声交谈，因为蜡烛要省着用，留给那些在春天还可能活着的人。讨论了一阵，大家说必须得有一个人走到海边去，把我们的困境告诉外面的人。说到这儿，所有人的眼睛都看向我，因为众所周知我是一个了不起的旅行者。‘要走七百英里，’我说，‘才能从这儿走到海边的海恩斯教区，而且每一英寸都需要雪鞋开路。给我你们最好的狗，最好的粮，我就去。帕苏克也要和我一块儿。’</td>
		<td class="en">“Then came we together in the store one night, and the empty shelves made us feel our own emptiness the more.We talked low, by the light of the fire, for the candles had been set aside for those who might yet gasp in the spring.Discussion was held, and it was said that a man must go forth to the Salt Water and tell to the world our misery.At this all eyes turned to me, for it was understood that I was a great traveler.‘It is seven hundred miles,’ said I, ‘to Haines Mission by the sea, and every inch of it snowshoe work.Give me the pick of your dogs and the best of your grub, and I will go.And with me shall go Passuk.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些条件他们都同意了。有个人却起身反对，他叫朗·杰夫，是一个美国佬，骨架大，肌肉结实。他说话口气也大。他同样是一个了不起的旅行者。据他说，他天生擅长走雪路，又是喝水牛的奶长大的。他要和我一道去，说要是我在路边倒下了，他还可以把话带到教区去。我当时太年轻，不了解美国佬。我怎么知道说大话的人其实空长一身肥肉，做大事的美国佬反而不会轻易开口？于是我们就带上了最好的狗和最好的粮上路了，我们三个——帕苏克、朗·杰夫和我。</td>
		<td class="en">“To this they were agreed.But there arose one, Long Jeff, a Yankee-man, big-boned and big-muscled.Also his talk was big.He, too, was a mighty traveler, he said, born to the snowshoe and bred up on buffalo milk.He would go with me, in case I fell by the trail, that he might carry the word on to the Mission.I was young, and I knew not Yankee-men.How was I to know that big talk betokened the streak of fat, or that Yankee-men who did great things kept their teeth together?So we took the pick of the dogs and the best of the grub, and struck the trail, we three,—Passuk, Long Jeff, and I.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好了，你们都在没人走过的雪地里开过路，费劲儿扳过雪橇的方向杆，也习惯了河上大量冰块的堵塞，所以这些辛苦我也就不说了，只是有些天我们走了十英里，有些天走了三十英里，但通常是十英里。那些最好的食物也并不怎么样，何况我们一开始就省着吃。同样地，最壮实的狗其实也不怎么样，让它们好好站立起来都很困难。到白河时，我们的三驾雪橇剩了两驾，可我们才走了两百英里。不过我们也没什么损失，掉队的狗全进了其他狗的肚子。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, ye have broken virgin snow, labored at the gee-pole, and are not unused to the packed river-jams; so I will talk little of the toil, save that on some days we made ten miles, and on others thirty, but more often ten.And the best of the grub was not good, while we went on stint from the start.Likewise the pick of the dogs was poor, and we were hard put to keep them on their legs.At the White River our three sleds became two sleds, and we had only come two hundred miles.But we lost nothing; the dogs that left the traces went into the bellies of those that remained.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没听见一句招呼，没看到一缕炊烟，我们就这样到了佩利。我指望在这儿补充些粮食，也打算着在这儿离开朗·杰夫。他走得乏了，一直在抱怨。可惜这儿的代理商正犯哮喘，病得两眼发亮，他的地窖几乎空了。他还给我们看了传教士空空的地窖，还有传教士的坟墓。为了防狗，周围全是垒得高高的石头。那儿还有一群印第安人，但其中没有小孩和老人。显然，只有少数几个人能熬到春天。</td>

		<td class="en">“And when she grew cold in my arms I arose, and sought out the well-filled pouch, and girt on my snowshoes, and staggered along the trail; for there was a weakness in my knees, and my head was dizzy, and in my ears there was a roaring, and a flashing of fire upon my eyes.The forgotten trails of boyhood came back to me.I sat by the full pots of the potlach feast, and raised my voice in song, and danced to the chanting of the men and maidens and the booming of the walrus drums.And Passuk held my hand and walked by my side.When I laid down to sleep, she waked me.When I stumbled and fell, she raised me.When I wandered in the deep snow, she led me back to the trail.And in this wise, like a man bereft of reason, who sees strange visions and whose thoughts are light with wine, I came to Haines Mission by the sea.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >赛特卡·查利掀开帐篷门帘。这时正是正午。一轮冰冷的、圆盘状的太阳悬在正南方，就在那荒凉的亨德森分水岭旁。日晕两侧，幻日闪耀。空气好像璀璨霜花结成的薄纱。帐前路旁，一条狼狗竖着结了霜的毛，仰天长啸，发出悲鸣。</td>
		<td class="en">Sitka Charley threw back the tent-flaps.It was midday.To the south, just clearing the bleak Henderson Divide, poised the cold- disked sun.On either hand the sun-dogs blazed.The air was a gossamer of glittering frost.In the foreground, beside the trail, a wolf-dog, bristling with frost, thrust a long snout heavenward and mourned.</td></tr>
