		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一辆小型的四号蒸汽机车，铿锵作响地从塞尔斯顿摇摇晃晃地驶来——七节货车的车厢塞得满满的。它咆哮着出现在拐角处，似乎有着惊人的速度，但荆豆丛中一匹受到它惊吓的小马驹一阵慢跑就将它远远地抛在身后，荆豆在寒冷的午后仍微微地摇曳着。一个女人沿着通往安德伍德方向的铁路线走着，她退回到树篱丛中，将篮子挽在一边，看着火车踏板向前行进。她被困在震颤的黑色车厢与树篱间，显得很不起眼。敞篷货车重重地撞击着铁轨，一节一节地缓缓驶过。接着，货车便转弯朝着矮树林驶去。那儿栎树的枯叶无声洒落，鸟儿收回搁在轨道旁猩红色的尾巴，匆匆逃进已悄然笼罩灌木林的暮色中。野外，发动机的烟尘不断飘落，粘附在杂草上。田野阴沉而荒凉，在那使人产生奇思怪想的沼泽地带、芦苇丛生的坑塘里，家禽已经不在桤木林中奔忙，而是栖息在涂了焦油的窝棚中。矿坑口隐隐出现在坑塘远处，在午后慵懒的光线中，阳光如红疮般舔舐着覆满灰尘的井沿。就在远处，坐落着布林斯利煤矿那尖塔状的烟囱和笨重黝黑的轮轴头架。两只轮子向着天空飞速旋转，卷扬机发出阵阵响声。矿工们被卷了出来。</td>
		<td class="en">The small locomotive engine, Number 4, came clanking, stumbling down from Selston—with seven full waggons.It appeared round the corner with loud threats of speed, but the colt that it startled from among the gorse, which still flickered indistinctly in the raw afternoon, outdistanced it at a canter.A woman, walking up the railway line to Underwood, drew back into the hedge, held her basket aside, and watched the footplate of the engine advancing.The trucks thumped heavily past, one by one, with slow inevitable movement, as she stood insignificantly trapped between the jolting black waggons and the hedge; then they curved away towards the coppice where the withered oak leaves dropped noiselessly, while the birds, pulling at the scarlet hips beside the track, made off into the dusk that had already crept into the spinney.In the open, the smoke from the engine sank and cleaved to the rough grass.The fields were dreary and forsaken, and in the marshy strip that led to the whimsey, a reedy pit-pond, the fowls had already abandoned their run among the alders, to roost in the tarred fowl-house.The pit-bank loomed up beyond the pond, flames like red sores licking its ashy sides, in the afternoon’s stagnant light.Just beyond rose the tapering chimneys and the clumsy black head-stocks of Brinsley Colliery.The two wheels were spinning fast up against the sky, and the winding-engine rapped out its little spasms.The miners were being turned up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >火车一边鸣笛，一边开进了煤矿旁铁路线上宽敞的站台，那里停靠着一排一排的货车。</td>
		<td class="en">The engine whistled as it came into the wide bay of railway lines beside the colliery, where rows of trucks stood in harbour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >工人们或独行，或随后跟着，或三五成群，如幽灵般四散回家去了。在平行排列的铁轨边坐落着一幢小屋，位于煤渣小路向下的三个台阶处。一大根枯瘦的葡萄藤紧紧抓附在房屋上，似乎要撕掉这用瓦铺成的屋顶。院子是用砖头围起来的，四周种着一些冷冷的报春花。更远处，长长的花园沿坡而下，一直延伸到一段覆着灌木丛的小河道。那儿有一些小枝繁茂的苹果树、洋李子树和东倒西歪的卷心菜。小路边缀满散乱的粉红色菊花，如粉红色的衣服挂在灌木丛上。在花园的半道上，一个女人弯腰从盖着毛毡的鸡窝里走了出来。她关上门，扣上锁，掸掉她白色围裙上的一些小碎物，接着直起了身子。</td>
		<td class="en">Miners, single, trailing and in groups, passed like shadows diverging home.At the edge of the ribbed level of sidings squat a low cottage, three steps down from the cinder track.A large bony vine clutched at the house, as if to claw down the tiled roof.Round the bricked yard grew a few wintry primroses.Beyond, the long garden sloped down to a bush-covered brook course.There were some twiggy apple trees, winter-crack trees, and ragged cabbages.Beside the path hung dishevelled pink chrysanthemums, like pink cloths hung on bushes.A woman came stooping out of the felt-covered fowl-house, half-way down the garden.She closed and padlocked the door, then drew herself erect, having brushed some bits from her white apron.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是一个神态高傲的高挑女人，相貌俊秀，眉毛十分浓黑。她顺滑的黑发被从中间恰到好处地分开。有好一阵子，她一动不动地站着，看着矿工们沿着铁路走来，然后她转身朝小河道走去。她的脸平静而坚毅，她紧闭的嘴透出幡然醒悟的气息。过了一阵子，她喊道：“约翰！”</td>
		<td class="en">She was a tall woman of imperious mien, handsome, with definite black eyebrows.Her smooth black hair was parted exactly.For a few moments she stood steadily watching the miners as they passed along the railway: then she turned towards the brook course.Her face was calm and set, her mouth was closed with disillusionment.After a moment she called: “John!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没有人答应。她等了一会儿，然后清楚地喊道：“你在哪里？”</td>
		<td class="en">There was no answer.She waited, and then said distinctly: “Where are you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在这里！”灌木丛中，一个小孩愠怒地回答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Here!” replied a child’s sulky voice from among the bushes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女人透过暮色望过去。</td>
		<td class="en">The woman looked piercingly through the dusk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在小溪边吗？”她严厉地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you at that brook?” she asked sternly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到后，小孩从像鞭子一样向上生长的覆盆子灌木丛里钻了出来。这是一个五岁的结实的小男孩。他挑衅般地站在那儿，一动不动。</td>
		<td class="en">For answer the child showed himself before the raspberry-canes that rose like whips.He was a small, sturdy boy of five.He stood quite still, defiantly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢！”母亲略感宽慰地说道：</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh!” said the mother, conciliated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我以为你在下面那条湿漉漉的小溪边呢——你还记得我跟你说过什么吧——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I thought you were down at that wet brook—and you remember what I told you—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩没动，也没有回答。</td>
		<td class="en">The boy did not move or answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来，回家。”女人的声音更加温柔，“天快黑了。你外公的火车正沿着铁路驶下来呢！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come, come on in,” she said more gently, “it’s getting dark.There’s your grandfather’s engine coming down the line!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小男孩慢悠悠地向前走着，心怀不满，一言不发。他穿着裤子和马甲，对于这个年纪的孩子来说，布料过于厚重和粗糙。它们显然是从成年男子的衣服上裁下来的。</td>
		<td class="en">The lad advanced slowly, with resentful, taciturn movement.He was dressed in trousers and waistcoat of cloth that was too thick and hard for the size of the garments.They were evidently cut down from a man’s clothes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他们慢慢走向房子的时候，他扯下一束束散碎的菊花，然后把花瓣一把把地丢在路上。</td>
		<td class="en">As they went slowly towards the house he tore at the ragged wisps of chrysanthemums and dropped the petals in handfuls along the path.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不要那样做——看着真讨厌。”母亲说道。孩子不再摘花了，但女人却突然怜惜地折下一枝细枝，上面有三四朵了无生气的花朵，然后把它们贴在自己的脸上。当母亲和儿子来到院子里时，她的手停在半空中犹豫了一下，她没有把花扔在一旁，而是别在了围裙的系带上。母子俩站在三级台阶下，望着对面铁轨站台那些匆匆回家的矿工们。小火车的车轮迫近了。突然间，火车头从房子经过，赫然停在了院门对面。</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t do that—it does look nasty,” said his mother.He refrained, and she, suddenly pitiful, broke off a twig with three or four wan flowers and held them against her face.When mother and son reached the yard her hand hesitated, and instead of laying the flower aside, she pushed it in her apron-band.The mother and son stood at the foot of the three steps looking across the bay of lines at the passing home of the miners.The trundle of the small train was imminent.Suddenly the engine loomed past the house and came to a stop opposite the gate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >火车司机——一个矮个子男人，满嘴留着灰白的络腮胡——从驾驶室探出身子，那驾驶室比女人高出许多。</td>
		<td class="en">The engine-driver, a short man with round grey beard, leaned out of the cab high above the woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有茶吗？”他欢快而又亲切地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Have you got a cup of tea?” he said in a cheery, hearty fashion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那是她父亲。她走了进去，说她可以泡一些来。她很快就回来了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was her father.She went in, saying she would mash.Directly, she returned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我星期天没来看你。”灰白络腮胡子的小个子男人开始说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I didn’t come to see you on Sunday,” began the little grey-bearded man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我没指望你会来。”女儿说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I didn’t expect you,” said his daughter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >火车司机皱了皱眉头，接着又恢复了他那快乐、轻松的神色，他说道：</td>
		<td class="en">The engine-driver winced; then, reassuming his cheery, airy manner, he said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，你听到了吗？那么，你认为怎么样呢——？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, have you heard then?Well, and what do you think—?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我觉得这够快的了。”她答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I think it is soon enough,” she replied.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到她小小的责备，小个子男人做了个不耐烦的手势，然后哄骗加威胁地冰冷地说道：</td>
		<td class="en">At her brief censure the little man made an impatient gesture, and said coaxingly, yet with dangerous coldness:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好啦，一个男人该做些什么？对于我这样年纪的男人，像个陌生人一样坐在自己的壁炉边，这不能算像样的生活。如果我再婚，这看起来似乎又有点晚——这关其他人什么事？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, what’s a man to do?It’s no sort of life for a man of my years, to sit at my own hearth like a stranger.And if I’m going to marry again it may as well be soon as late—what does it matter to anybody?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女人没有回答，转身走进屋子。驾驶室的男人傲慢地站立着，直到她拿着一杯茶和一个上面放着黄油面包的盘子回来。她走上台阶，站在嘶嘶作响的火车的踏板旁。</td>
		<td class="en">The woman did not reply, but turned and went into the house.The man in the engine-cab stood assertive, till she returned with a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter on a plate.She went up the steps and stood near the footplate of the hissing engine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不必给我拿黄油面包。”她父亲说道。“但一杯茶，”他赞赏地啜了一口，“倒非常不错。”男人又抿了几口，然后说道：“我听说沃尔特又犯病了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You needn’t ’a’ brought me bread an’ butter,” said her father.“But a cup of tea”—he sipped appreciatively—“it’s very nice.”He sipped for a moment or two, then: “I hear as Walter’s got another bout on,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他什么时候不犯病？”女人挖苦地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“When hasn’t he?” said the woman bitterly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我听说在去之前，他在“纳尔逊贵族酒馆”吹牛说他要花半个金币。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I heared tell of him in the ‘Lord Nelson’ braggin’ as he was going to spend that before he went: half a sovereign that was.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么时候？”女人问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“When?” asked the woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一个周六晚上——我知道那是真的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A’ Sat’day night—I know that’s true.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很有可能。”她苦笑着。“他给了我23先令。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Very likely,” she laughed bitterly.“He gives me twenty-three shillings.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，当一个男人花钱办不成事，却行同禽兽的时候，倒是件好事！”灰白胡须的男人说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Aye, it’s a nice thing, when a man can do nothing with his money but make a beast of himself!” said the grey-whiskered man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女人将头扭向一边。她父亲咽下最后一点茶，然后把杯子递给她。</td>
		<td class="en">The woman turned her head away.Her father swallowed the last of his tea and handed her the cup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉。”他擦了擦嘴巴叹气道。“这也算是个法子，这是——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Aye,” he sighed, wiping his mouth.“It’s a settler, it is—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把手放在操作杆上。发动机拉紧沉吟着，火车又轰隆隆地朝交叉口开去。女人再次朝对面的铁轨望去。夜色正笼罩着铁轨和货车上面的天空，一群阴沉而忧郁的矿工仍在往家走。卷扬机匆匆运转着，间或有短暂的停顿。伊丽莎白·贝茨看着那令人烦闷的人流，然后走进了屋子。她丈夫没有回来。</td>
		<td class="en">He put his hand on the lever.The little engine strained and groaned, and the train rumbled towards the crossing.The woman again looked across the metals.Darkness was settling over the spaces of the railway and trucks: the miners, in grey sombre groups, were still passing home.The winding-engine pulsed hurriedly, with brief pauses.Elizabeth Bates looked at the dreary flow of men, then she went indoors.Her husband did not come.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >厨房很小，充满着炉火的光；煤块堆积在烟囱口，烧得红彤彤。屋内所有的活力好像就在那白色温暖的壁炉里，在映射着红色炉火的铁制壁炉挡板上。桌布已为晚茶铺就，杯子在暗影中闪着微光。屋子后面，最低的一级楼梯延伸到屋子里，男孩坐在那里，用刀使劲儿地鼓捣一块白木。他几乎隐没在了暗影里。已经四点半了。可是他们得等父亲回来才能开始喝茶。当母亲看着她的儿子闷闷不乐地摆弄木头时，她在他的沉默与执拗中看到了自己的影子，在他那只顾自己、漠不关心中看到了他父亲的影子。她的思绪似乎被她丈夫占据了。他很可能早就路过自己家，偷偷溜过家门口去其他地方喝酒，让家人空等他回来吃饭。她瞟了一眼钟，然后拿起马铃薯去院子里滤干。小溪那边的花园和田野笼罩在无尽的黑暗中。当她端着深平底锅起来，把热气腾腾的水倒入身后的黑夜里时，她看见铁路线和田野的空旷处那边，沿山而上的公路旁的黄灯已被点亮。</td>
		<td class="en">The kitchen was small and full of firelight; red coals piled glowing up the chimney mouth.All the life of the room seemed in the white, warm hearth and the steel fender reflecting the red fire.The cloth was laid for tea; cups glinted in the shadows.At the back, where the lowest stairs protruded into the room, the boy sat struggling with a knife and a piece of whitewood.He was almost hidden in the shadow.It was half-past four.They had but to await the father’s coming to begin tea.As the mother watched her son’s sullen little struggle with the wood, she saw herself in his silence and pertinacity; she saw the father in her child’s indifference to all but himself.She seemed to be occupied by her husband.He had probably gone past his home, slunk past his own door, to drink before he came in, while his dinner spoiled and wasted in waiting.She glanced at the clock, then took the potatoes to strain them in the yard.The garden and fields beyond the brook were closed in uncertain darkness.When she rose with the saucepan, leaving the drain steaming into the night behind her, she saw the yellow lamps were lit along the high road that went up the hill away beyond the space of the railway lines and the field.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，她又看了看那些成群结队回家的男人，现在人越来越少了。</td>
		<td class="en">Then again she watched the men trooping home, fewer now and fewer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >屋内炉火要熄灭了，房间映在一片暗红中。女人将深平底锅放在炉盘上，接着，把糊状的布丁放在炉嘴上。然后她坐下来，一动也不动。谢天谢地，门外传来匆忙而轻快的脚步声。有人在门闩上停顿了一下，然后一个小女孩儿走进来，开始脱去她那身出门的行头，用帽子拨开遮住她眼睛的一团金褐相间的卷发。</td>
		<td class="en">Indoors the fire was sinking and the room was dark red.The woman put her saucepan on the hob, and set a batter pudding near the mouth of the oven.Then she stood unmoving.Directly, gratefully, came quick young steps to the door.Someone hung on the latch a moment, then a little girl entered and began pulling off her outdoor things, dragging a mass of curls, just ripening from gold to brown, over her eyes with her hat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她母亲斥责她从学校回来得太晚，说在这样阴暗的冬日里，她本该把她关在家里。</td>
		<td class="en">Her mother chid her for coming late from school, and said she would have to keep her at home the dark winter days.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么呀，妈妈，天还没怎么黑呢。灯都还没有点，而且爸爸也还没回家啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, mother, it’s hardly a bit dark yet.The lamp’s not lighted, and my father’s not home.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没，他还没回家。但现在都差一刻到5点了！你看见他的影子没？”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, he isn’t.But it’s a quarter to five!Did you see anything of him?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >孩子变得严肃起来。她用一双惆怅的蓝色大眼睛看着她的母亲。</td>
		<td class="en">The child became serious.She looked at her mother with large, wistful blue eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有，妈妈，我压根没看见过他。哎！他是不是上来后就直接走过家门去老布林斯利酒馆了？他不会的，妈妈，因为我没看过他在那里。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, mother, I’ve never seen him.Why?Has he come up an’ gone past, to Old Brinsley?He hasn’t, mother, ’cos I never saw him.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们坐下来用茶。约翰坐在桌子一头，靠在门边，身子几乎隐没在黑暗中。他们相互避开彼此的脸。女孩面向壁炉挡板蹲着，在火前慢慢地翻动着一块厚厚的面包。小家伙的脸在暗影上投下一个昏暗的轮廓，他坐在那里，看着姐姐在红彤彤的火光中变得美丽的身影。</td>
		<td class="en">They sat down to tea.John, at the end of the table near the door, was almost lost in the darkness.Their faces were hidden from each other.The girl crouched against the fender slowly moving a thick piece of bread before the fire.The lad, his face a dusky mark on the shadow, sat watching her who was transfigured in the red glow.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久，黑暗的屋子里忙活开了，传来嘎吱嘎吱的松脆响声。母亲吃得很少。她快速地喝完自己的茶，坐着想事情。当她站起身的时候，她那僵硬挺直的头明显露出了愤怒。她看着挡板里的布丁，爆发了：</td>
		<td class="en">Soon the room was busy in the darkness with the crisp sound of crunching.The mother ate very little.She drank her tea determinedly, and sat thinking.When she rose her anger was evident in the stern unbending of her head.She looked at the pudding in the fender, and broke out:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Elizabeth sank down again to the floor, and put her face against his neck, and trembled and shuddered.But she had to draw away again.He was dead, and her living flesh had no place against his.A great dread and weariness held her: she was so unavailing.Her life was gone like this.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他如牛奶般洁白，如十二月大的婴儿般清白，保佑他吧，我亲爱的孩子！”老母亲低声自语着，“他没有一块疤痕，清澈、纯净、洁白、美丽如一个初生的小孩。”她自豪地嘀咕着。伊丽莎白还是掩着自己的脸。</td>
		<td class="en">“White as milk he is, clear as a twelve-month baby, bless him, the darling!”the old mother murmured to herself.“Not a mark on him, clear and clean and white, beautiful as ever a child was made,” she murmured with pride.Elizabeth kept her face hidden.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他安静地走了，莉齐——安静得像睡着了。他很漂亮吧，这宝贝？唉——他一定安息了，莉齐。或许他早弄好了，莉齐，困在里面的时候。他有时间哩。如果他没有安息，他看起来不会像这样。宝贝，亲爱的宝贝。啊，但他也曾尽情地笑过。我最爱听那笑了。他非常尽情地大笑了，莉齐，就像个小伙子——”</td>
		<td class="en">“He went peaceful, Lizzie—peaceful as sleep.Isn’t he beautiful, the lamb?Ay—he must ha’ made his peace, Lizzie.’Appen he made it all right, Lizzie, shut in there.He’d have time.He wouldn’t look like this if he hadn’t made his peace.The lamb, the dear lamb.Eh, but he had a hearty laugh.I loved to hear it.He had the heartiest laugh, Lizzie, as a lad—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伊丽莎白抬头看了看。这男人的嘴缩回去了，在胡须的覆盖下微微张开。这双眼睛，半闭着，晦暗中显不出光彩。他的生命如云烟，燃烧后消逝，给她留下一个隔绝和完全陌生的他。她知道对于她来说，他是怎样的一个陌生人。在她的子宫里，恐惧结成了冰，因为曾和她生活过的这具血肉之躯成了相隔的路人。这就是生活的全部意义么——在生命热度的掩饰下，那彻底、完全的隔绝？她害怕地转过脸。这事实太过致命。他们之间什么也没有了，尽管他们曾走到一起，反复将他们的裸体交给对方。曾经，每一次他占有她的肉体之后，他们就是两个隔绝的人，如同现在一样遥远。他同她一样不负责任。她子宫里的孩子就像块冰。因为当她看着死去的男人时，她冰冷、超然的理智就会清晰地说着：“我是谁？我一直在做什么？我一直在同一个并不存在的丈夫抗争着。他却一直存在着。我做了什么错事？和我一直生活在一起的到底是什么？现实就躺在眼前——这个男人。”而她的灵魂因恐惧在她心中死去：她知道她从未理解过他，他也从未了解过她，他们在冥冥中相遇，在冥冥中相斗，却不知道他们遇见了谁，抑或在同谁斗。但是，现在她明白了。她看着男人，沉默了。因为她过去错了。她曾说他是个矛盾存在，她曾觉得和他很熟悉。但是他始终还是离开了，过着她所从未有过的生活，感受她所未有过的感受。</td>
		<td class="en">Elizabeth looked up.The man’s mouth was fallen back, slightly open under the cover of the moustache.The eyes, half shut, did not show glazed in the obscurity.Life with its smoky burning gone from him, had left him apart and utterly alien to her.And she knew what a stranger he was to her.In her womb was ice of fear, because of this separate stranger with whom she had been living as one flesh.Was this what it all meant—utter, intact separateness, obscured by heat of living?In dread she turned her face away.The fact was too deadly.There had been nothing between them, and yet they had come together, exchanging their nakedness repeatedly.Each time he had taken her, they had been two isolated beings, far apart as now.He was no more responsible than she.The child was like ice in her womb.For as she looked at the dead man, her mind, cold and detached, said clearly: “Who am I?What have I been doing?I have been fighting a husband who did not exist.HE existed all the time.What wrong have I done?What was that I have been living with?There lies the reality, this man.”—And her soul died in her for fear: she knew she had never seen him, he had never seen her, they had met in the dark and had fought in the dark, not knowing whom they met nor whom they fought.And now she saw, and turned silent in seeing.For she had been wrong.She had said he was something he was not; she had felt familiar with him.Whereas he was apart all the while, living as she never lived, feeling as she never felt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她带着恐惧和羞愧看着那具她曾经误解的赤裸裸的身体。他是她孩子们的父亲。她的灵魂似乎被抽离出了身体。她兀自站立着。她看着他裸露的尸身，感到很羞愧，仿佛她曾经错看了他。毕竟，那就是他自己。对她来说，这很令她恐惧。她看着他的脸，然后把自己的脸扭向墙边。因为，他的神色与她的不同，他的做法亦有别于她的做法。她曾否认他作为自我的存在——现在她明白了。她曾拒绝他的自我——而这就是她曾经的生活，还有他的生活——她感谢死亡，死亡重塑了真相。而她知道她并未死去。</td>
		<td class="en">In fear and shame she looked at his naked body, that she had known falsely.And he was the father of her children.Her soul was torn from her body and stood apart.She looked at his naked body and was ashamed, as if she had denied it.After all, it was itself.It seemed awful to her.She looked at his face, and she turned her own face to the wall.For his look was other than hers, his way was not her way.She had denied him what he was—she saw it now.She had refused him as himself.—And this had been her life, and his life.—She was grateful to death, which restored the truth.And she knew she was not dead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她心中始终充满着对他的悲伤和怜悯。他蒙受了多少痛苦？这个无助的男人经受了多少的恐惧！她因莫大的痛苦而身体僵直。她没能帮到他。他被残酷地伤害了，这个裸露着的男人，这另一个存在，而她却无法做出补偿。还有孩子们——但孩子们是属于活着的人的。这个死去的男人同他们没有任何关系。他和她只是生命通道，经过这通道，生命流动而产生了孩子们。她是一位母亲——但她现在知道作为一名妻子是多么可怕。而已经死去的他，一定感觉到了作为一个丈夫是多么可怕。她觉得在另外那个世界，他之于她会是一个陌生人。如果他们在那里相遇——在来世，他们只会为之前的一切而羞愧。因某些神秘的原因，孩子出生了——从他俩那里。但孩子们并没有让他们成为一体。现在他死了，她知道她与他永生永世地分离了，他和她永生永世再没了关系。她明白她生命的这段插曲结束了。他们曾在生活中相互否定。现在他退场了。一阵剧痛掠过她心头。那么就这样了结吧：在他死去之前很久，他们之间曾变得那么无望。但他曾是她的丈夫。但那多么微不足道啊！——</td>
		<td class="en">And all the while her heart was bursting with grief and pity for him.What had he suffered?What stretch of horror for this helpless man!She was rigid with agony.She had not been able to help him.He had been cruelly injured, this naked man, this other being, and she could make no reparation.There were the children—but the children belonged to life.This dead man had nothing to do with them.He and she were only channels through which life had flowed to issue in the children.She was a mother—but how awful she knew it now to have been a wife.And he, dead now, how awful he must have felt it to be a husband.She felt that in the next world he would be a stranger to her.If they met there, in the beyond, they would only be ashamed of what had been before.The children had come, for some mysterious reason, out of both of them.But the children did not unite them.Now he was dead, she knew how eternally he was apart from her, how eternally he had nothing more to do with her.She saw this episode of her life closed.They had denied each other in life.Now he had withdrawn.An anguish came over her.It was finished then: it had become hopeless between them long before he died.Yet he had been her husband.But how little!—</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“烘干了。”她说道，四处地抓着棉衬衫在试着什么。她几乎羞于触摸他。她、或任何其他人有什么权利把手放在他身上呢，当她触到他身体的时候，是那么地谦卑不已。给他穿上衣服是一件艰难的差事。他是如此沉重而钝拙。一种可怕的恐惧一直攥着她：那就是他如此沉重、了无生气、毫无反应地离开了。于她来说，他们之间那遥远距离带来的恐惧是难以承受的——这是一个她必须跨越的、无边无际的鸿沟。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is aired,” she said, grasping the cotton shirt here and there to try.She was almost ashamed to handle him; what right had she or anyone to lay hands on him; but her touch was humble on his body.It was hard work to clothe him.He was so heavy and inert.A terrible dread gripped her all the while: that he could be so heavy and utterly inert, unresponsive, apart.The horror of the distance between them was almost too much for her—it was so infinite a gap she must look across.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于干完了。她们用一块床单盖住他——盖着脸，让他躺着。接着，她闩好小客厅的门，以免孩子们看见那里躺着什么。然后，她平静下来，开始着手收拾厨房。她知道她屈从了生活，生活就是她现在的主宰。但从死亡——她的终极主宰那里，她却带着恐惧和羞愧畏缩了。</td>
		<td class="en">At last it was finished.They covered him with a sheet and left him lying, with his face bound.And she fastened the door of the little parlour, lest the children should see what was lying there.Then, with peace sunk heavy on her heart, she went about making tidy the kitchen.She knew she submitted to life, which was her immediate master.But from death, her ultimate master, she winced with fear and shame.</td></tr>
