		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他是那种很安静很镇定的人，在墙头上坐一会儿，聆听潮湿夜色中潜藏的危险的征兆。但他的听力陡然下降，他几乎什么都听不到，只听见风吹过看不见的树木发出的萧萧声和树枝晃动时叶子发出的沙沙声。被风驱赶着的浓雾弥漫开来，他虽然看不到这雾，但它的湿气吹到了他的脸上，而且他坐着的墙头也是湿的。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a very quiet, self-possessed sort of man, sitting a moment on top of the wall to sound the damp darkness for warnings of the dangers it might conceal.But the plummet of his hearing brought nothing to him save the moaning of wind through invisible trees and the rustling of leaves on swaying branches.A heavy fog drifted and drove before the wind, and though he could not see this fog, the wet of it blew upon his face, and the wall on which he sat was wet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他悄无声息地从外侧爬上墙头，然后又跳到内侧的地上，仍旧没弄出一点声响。他从兜里摸出一根手电筒，却并没有用它。路很黑，但他并不急于照亮它。他手里握着手电筒，手指放在按钮上，在黑暗中前进。</td>
		<td class="en">Without noise he had climbed to the top of the wall from the outside, and without noise he dropped to the ground on the inside.From his pocket he drew an electric night-stick, but he did not use it.Dark as the way was, he was not anxious for light.Carrying the night-stick in his hand, his finger on the button, he advanced through the darkness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >地上软绵绵的，踩上去很有弹性，到处都是枯萎的松针、树叶和菌类，很明显已经多年没有人和动物来过了。叶子和树枝擦过他的身体，可是因为天太黑了，所以他也躲不开它们。不久，他便把手伸在前面摸索着走，接着，他那伸出的手不止一次地碰到大树坚固的树干。他知道自己身边全是这种树，也感觉到它们在各个角落若隐若现，而且他有一种奇怪的感觉，自己似乎很渺小，周围巨大的树木都在向他倾斜，像是要压扁他。他知道远处就是那座房子，他希望能找到一条轻松通向它的小径或是蜿蜒小路。</td>
		<td class="en">The ground was velvety and springy to his feet, being carpeted with dead pine-needles and leaves and mold which evidently had been undisturbed for years.Leaves and branches brushed against his body, but so dark was it that he could not avoid them.Soon he walked with his hand stretched out gropingly before him, and more than once the hand fetched up against the solid trunks of massive trees.All about him he knew were these trees; he sensed the loom of them everywhere; and he experienced a strange feeling of microscopic smallness in the midst of great bulks leaning toward him to crush him.Beyond, he knew, was the house, and he expected to find some trail or winding path that would lead easily to it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一次，他发现自己被困住了。无论他往哪个方向走，要么是摸到树枝和树干，要么就撞上灌木矮丛，直到似乎无路可循。接着他打开灯，谨慎地照亮脚下的地面。他缓慢地、小心地移动着手电，照亮自己的周围，这束白光照亮了他前进路上所有的障碍，分毫毕现。他看见巨大的树干中有个洞，然后就穿了过去，然后关上手电筒，踩在干干的路面上。由于那路面上方全是浓密的树叶，因而没有被雾水打湿，表面是干的。他的方向感很强，他知道自己正朝房子的方向走去。</td>
		<td class="en">Once, he found himself trapped.On every side he groped against trees and branches, or blundered into thickets of underbrush, until there seemed no way out.Then he turned on his light, circumspectly, directing its rays to the ground at his feet.Slowly and carefully he moved it about him, the white brightness showing in sharp detail all the obstacles to his progress.He saw, an opening between huge-trunked trees, and advanced through it, putting out the light and treading on dry footing as yet protected from the drip of the fog by the dense foliage overhead.His sense of direction was good, and he knew he was going toward the house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着就发生了那件事——出人意料、不敢想象。正下落的脚踩在一个软软的活物上，在他的重压下那东西哼了一声。他跳到了别处，蹲在一边准备再跳到别的地方，紧张地等待着不明物的袭击。他等了一会儿，琢磨着是什么动物从他的脚下爬起来，现在却悄无声息，没有一点动静了。它肯定也正蹲在那里等着，和他一样紧张而又期待。这种紧张的气氛变得令人难以忍受。他把手电筒举在身前，按了下按钮，看了过去，接着就恐惧地大声尖叫起来。他做好心理准备去面对各种动物，从受惊的小牛、小鹿到凶猛的狮子，可是对自己看到的这个东西一点心理准备都没有。在那一瞬间，他那小小的探照光，强烈而明亮，向他展示了一个他一千年都不会忘记的——人，巨大的体型，白皙的皮肤，黄色的头发，黄色的胡子，光着身子，只穿一双软面棕色鹿皮鞋，还有一件山羊皮似的东西挂在他的腰部。他的胳膊和腿是光着的，肩膀和大部分胸膛也是。他的皮肤光滑无毛，但因为风吹日晒而呈棕色，皮肤下面是打结的健壮的肌肉，就如同一条条肥蛇。只有这些，虽然出乎意料，但不足以让那个男人尖叫。让他害怕的是它脸上露出不可名状的凶残，蓝眼睛里闪着野兽般的光芒，在灯光的照射下并不显得晕眩，胡子和头发上缠粘着松树针，巨大的身体蹲在那里，正准备跳向他。实际上，在他看见这一切，还在尖叫的那一瞬，那东西就跳了过来，他把手电筒朝它砸了过去，自己则跌倒在地上。他感觉那个东西的双脚和胫骨撞到了他的肋骨，接着他跳起来然后又躲到一边去，而那时那东西猛地跳起又重重掉进矮树丛里。</td>
		<td class="en">And then the thing happened—the thing unthinkable and unexpected.His descending foot came down upon something that was soft and alive, and that arose with a snort under the weight of his body.He sprang clear, and crouched for another spring, anywhere, tense and expectant, keyed for the onslaught of the unknown.He waited a moment, wondering what manner of animal it was that had arisen from under his foot and that now made no sound nor movement and that must be crouching and waiting just as tensely and expectantly as he.The strain became unbearable.Holding the night-stick before him, he pressed the button, saw, and screamed aloud in terror.He was prepared for anything, from a frightened calf or fawn to a belligerent lion, but he was not prepared for what he saw.In that instant his tiny searchlight, sharp and white, had shown him what a thousand years would not enable him to forget—a man, huge and blond, yellow-haired and yellow-bearded, naked except for soft-tanned moccasins and what seemed a goat-skin about his middle.Arms and legs were bare, as were his shoulders and most of his chest.The skin was smooth and hairless, but browned by sun and wind, while under it heavy muscles were knotted like fat snakes.Still, this alone, unexpected as it well was, was not what had made the man scream out.What had caused his terror was the unspeakable ferocity of the face, the wild-animal glare of the blue eyes scarcely dazzled by the light, the pine-needles matted and clinging in the beard and hair, and the whole formidable body crouched and in the act of springing at him.Practically in the instant he saw all this, and while his scream still rang, the thing leaped, he flung his night-stick full at it, and threw himself to the ground.He felt its feet and shins strike against his ribs, and he bounded up and away while the thing itself hurled onward in a heavy crashing fall into the underbrush.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >跌落的响声消失后，那男人停下来，伏在地上等着。他能听到那东西走来走去地搜寻他，便不敢乱动害怕暴露自己的位置。他知道他自己不免会压着那灌木丛，然后又被它追逐。他曾掏出左轮手枪，不过又改变了主意。他镇定了下来，希望能够悄无声息地逃脱。有几次他听到那东西拍打着灌木丛找他，有时候它也会停下来听听动静。这让他想到了一个主意。他的一只手正放在一块死木头上。他先仔细地在黑暗中摸索确认有抡动胳膊的空间，接着就举起木头扔了出去。木头并不大，所以滚得很远，落进灌木丛时还发出很大的声响。他听到那东西跳进灌木丛，与此同时，就稳稳地爬走了。他手脚并用地小心翼翼地慢慢向前爬行，直到膝盖被湿透的菌类弄湿。当他想听听动静的时候，只能听得到风的呜咽声和雾水从树枝滴落的声音。他一点也没有放松警惕，笔直地站着，然后朝石墙走去，从墙上翻了过去，然后落在外侧的公路上。</td>
		<td class="en">As the noise of the fall ceased, the man stopped and on hands and knees waited.He could hear the thing moving about, searching for him, and he was afraid to advertise his location by attempting further flight.He knew that inevitably he would crackle the underbrush and be pursued.Once he drew out his revolver, then changed his mind.He had recovered his composure and hoped to get away without noise.Several times he heard the thing beating up the thickets for him, and there were moments when it, too, remained still and listened.This gave an idea to the man.One of his hands was resting on a chunk of dead wood.Carefully, first feeling about him in the darkness to know that the full swing of his arm was clear, he raised the chunk of wood and threw it.It was not a large piece, and it went far, landing noisily in a bush.He heard the thing bound into the bush, and at the same time himself crawled steadily away.And on hands and knees, slowly and cautiously, he crawled on, till his knees were wet on the soggy mold, When he listened he heard naught but the moaning wind and the drip-drip of the fog from the branches.Never abating his caution, he stood erect and went on to the stone wall, over which he climbed and dropped down to the road outside.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在一片灌木丛里摸来摸去，拽出一辆自行车，准备骑上去。正当他用脚转动齿轮，想把另一个脚蹬调整到合适的位置时，他听到砰的一声，很明显是一个笨重的身体轻盈落地的声音。他等都没等，立刻跑了起来，双手抓住车把，直到他能够跨上车座，踩住脚蹬，开始冲刺。他能够听到身后土路上咚咚咚快速的脚步声，可他躲开并甩掉了它。不幸的是，他开始朝着远离城镇的方向骑去，还冲着地势更高的山区骑去。他知道，在这条路上没什么交叉路。唯一能够回去的路径必须要经过那个可怕的怪物，可他没有决心去面对它。半小时后，他发现自己正在一条越来越陡的斜坡上，于是就下车了。为了更安全，他把车丢在路边，爬过篱笆来到一个他以为是沿山牧场的地方，然后把一张报纸铺在地上，坐了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">Feeling his way in a clump of bushes, he drew out a bicycle and prepared to mount.He was in the act of driving the gear around with his foot for the purpose of getting the opposite pedal in position, when he heard the thud of a heavy body that landed lightly and evidently on its feet.He did not wait for more, but ran, with hands on the handles of his bicycle, until he was able to vault astride the saddle, catch the pedals, and start a spurt.Behind he could hear the quick thud-thud of feet on the dust of the road, but he drew away from it and lost it.Unfortunately, he had started away from the direction of town and was heading higher up into the hills.He knew that on this particular road there were no cross roads.The only way back was past that terror, and he could not steel himself to face it.At the end of half an hour, finding himself on an ever increasing grade, he dismounted.For still greater safety, leaving the wheel by the roadside, he climbed through a fence into what he decided was a hillside pasture, spread a newspaper on the ground, and sat down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天啊！”他大叫了一声，抹着脸上的汗水和雾水。</td>
		<td class="en">“Gosh!” he said aloud, mopping the sweat and fog from his face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天啊！”他又说了一遍，一边卷了支烟，一边思考着怎么回去。</td>
		<td class="en">And “Gosh!” he said once again, while rolling a cigarette and as he pondered the problem of getting back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可他没打算往回走。他下定决心不在黑暗中走那段路，他蜷起腿把头靠在膝盖上打盹，等着天亮。</td>
		<td class="en">But he made no attempt to go back.He was resolved not to face that road in the dark, and with head bowed on knees, he dozed, waiting for daylight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不知道过了多久，他被一只小郊狼汪汪的叫声吵醒了。他向四周望了望，在身后的山崖上发现了那只郊狼，他还注意到了夜色的变化。雾散了，月亮和星星都出来了，连风也漫漫停了。加利福尼亚的这个夏夜变得格外宜人。他试着继续打个盹，可郊狼的叫声干扰着他。在他半睡半醒的时候，他听到了狂野又恐怖的唱歌声。他环顾四周，发现郊狼已经不叫了，那会儿正沿着山脊逃跑，在它后面，是他在花园里碰到的那个赤裸的动物，它已经不唱歌了，正全力追赶着那只郊狼。那是只小郊狼，当它就要被追上的时候，他们从他的视野中消失了。那男人如受寒一样发着抖，他开始跑起来，接着从篱笆上爬过去，骑上了他的车子。他知道这是他的机会。那个吓人的怪物不再夹在他和米尔山谷之间了。</td>
		<td class="en">How long afterward he did not know, he was awakened by the yapping bark of a young coyote.As he looked about and located it on the brow of the hill behind him, he noted the change that had come over the face of the night.The fog was gone; the stars and moon were out; even the wind had died down.It had transformed into a balmy California summer night.He tried to doze again, but the yap of the coyote disturbed him.Half asleep, he heard a wild and eery chant.Looking about him, he noticed that the coyote had ceased its noise and was running away along the crest of the hill, and behind it, in full pursuit, no longer chanting, ran the naked creature he had encountered in the garden.It was a young coyote, and it was being overtaken when the chase passed from view.The man trembled as with a chill as he started to his feet, clambered over the fence, and mounted his wheel.But it was his chance and he knew it.The terror was no longer between him and Mill Valley.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他飞快地骑车下山，可就在山底拐弯处浓密的树荫下，他遇到一处坑洼，并头向前从车把上方摔了出去。</td>
		<td class="en">He sped at a breakneck rate down the hill, but in the turn at the bottom, in the deep shadows, he encountered a chuck-hole and pitched headlong over the handle bar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我今晚运气真不好。”他咕哝着，一边检查车子上摔坏的前叉。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s sure not my night,” he muttered, as he examined the broken fork of the machine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他扛着坏了的车子，艰难地往前走。最后，他来到了石墙边，对自己的遭遇半信半疑，于是在路上寻找痕迹，然后就找到了它们——鹿皮鞋印，非常大，脚趾处的泥土是深陷的。就在他弯腰去观察鞋印的时候，他又听到那可怕的唱歌声。他看过那东西追逐郊狼的场面，知道自己直接跑是逃不掉的。他根本没有试图逃跑，只是躲在公路外侧的阴暗处。</td>
		<td class="en">Shouldering the useless wheel, he trudged on.In time he came to the stone wall, and, half disbelieving his experience, he sought in the road for tracks, and found them—moccasin tracks, large ones, deep-bitten into the dust at the toes.It was while bending over them, examining, that again he heard the eery chant.He had seen the thing pursue the coyote, and he knew he had no chance on a straight run.He did not attempt it, contenting himself with hiding in the shadows on the off side of the road.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着，他又看到那个像裸体男人一样的东西，轻盈快速地跑着，边跑边唱着歌。然后，它在他的对面停了下来，他的心跳都停止了。可是它没有朝他的藏身处走去，而是跳到空中，抓住路边树上的树枝，像只猩猩一样从一根树枝快速地向上摆动到另一根树枝。它摇摆着跃过那座石墙，比墙顶还高了十二英尺，抓到另一棵树的树枝上，然后跳到地上，不见了。那男人疑惑地等了几分钟，然后动身离开了。</td>
		<td class="en">And again he saw the thing that was like a naked man, running swiftly and lightly and singing as it ran.Opposite him it paused, and his heart stood still.But instead of coming toward his hiding-place, it leaped into the air, caught the branch of a roadside tree, and swung swiftly upward, from limb to limb, like an ape.It swung across the wall, and a dozen feet above the top, into the branches of another tree, and dropped out of sight to the ground.The man waited a few wondering minutes, then started on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二节</td>
		<td class="en">II</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戴夫·斯洛特挑衅地靠在阻拦他去詹姆斯·沃德先生私人办公室的桌子上。詹姆斯·沃德是沃德诺尔斯公司的高级合伙人之类的。戴夫生气了。外面办公室的每个人都怀疑地打量着他，正对着他的那个人更是一副怀疑的表情。</td>
		<td class="en">Dave Slotter leaned belligerently against the desk that barred the way to the private office of James Ward, senior partner of the firm of Ward, Knowles & Co..Dave was angry.Every one in the outer office had looked him over suspiciously, and the man who faced him was excessively suspicious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你就告诉沃德先生这件事很重要。”他敦促道。</td>

		<td class="en">“To-morrow will be too late.You just trot along and tell Mr.Ward it’s a matter of life and death.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >秘书犹豫起来，戴夫抓住这个有利条件。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当戴夫被引进私人办公室的时候，他的精神还处于战斗状态；可当他看到一个高大的白人坐在转椅上，从向速记员作口述转向他的时候，他的态度突然变了。他不知道自己为什么会变，还暗暗地生自己的生气。</td>
		<td class="en">When Dave was shown into the private office, he was still in the belligerent frame of mind, but when he saw a large fair man whirl in a revolving chair from dictating to a stenographer to face him, Dave’s demeanor abruptly changed.He did not know why it changed, and he was secretly angry with himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您是沃德先生？”戴夫的问话带着一丝愚蠢，这让他自己更生气了。他从没打算过要这么做。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我听说您一直独居，家里只有一个中国厨师，这对我来说很有利。可是我没闯进去。发生了点事阻止我没能进去。这就是我来这儿的原因。我是来提醒您的。我看见一个野人在您家院子随意出入——一个十足的魔鬼。他能把像我这样的人撕成碎片。他逼得我拼命地跑。值得一提的是，他没穿衣服，爬起树来就像只猴子，跑起来像只鹿。我还看见他在追赶一只郊狼，我最后一次看见他的时候，上帝啊，他就快追赶上那只郊狼了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I heard you lived all alone with a Chinaman for cook, and it looked good to me.Only I didn’t break in.Something happened that prevented.That’s why I’m here.I come to warn you.I found a wild man loose in your grounds—a regular devil.He could pull a guy like me to pieces.He gave me the run of my life.He don’t wear any clothes to speak of, he climbs trees like a monkey, and he runs like a deer.I saw him chasing a coyote, and the last I saw of it, by God, he was gaining on it.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“提醒您要小心。我自认自己并不那么好对付，可我不主张杀人……那是没有必要的。我觉得您处在危险之中。我认为自己应该提醒你。说实在的，那是赌博。当然，如果你想为我的麻烦补偿点什么，我也接受。我也这么想过。可是我不介意你是否送我东西。不管怎么样，我都会来提醒你的，完成我的义务。”沃德先生思考着，用手敲着桌面。戴夫注意到他的手很大，很有力，虽然晒黑了点可保养得很好。他又注意到刚才就吸引他眼球的东西——一只眼睛上方的额头上贴着一小条肉色的薄橡皮膏。强行进入他大脑中的想法仍然令人觉得不可思议。</td>
		<td class="en">“To warn you of your danger.I’m something of a hard proposition myself, but I don’t believe in killing people …that is, unnecessarily.I realized that you was in danger.I thought I’d warn you.Honest, that’s the game.Of course, if you wanted to give me anything for my trouble, I’d take it.That was in my mind, too.But I don’t care whether you give me anything or not.I’ve warned you anyway, and done my duty.”Mr. Ward meditated and drummed on the surface of his desk.Dave noticed they were large, powerful hands, withal well-cared for despite their dark sunburn.Also, he noted what had already caught his eye before—a tiny strip of flesh-colored courtplaster on the forehead over one eye.And still the thought that forced itself into his mind was unbelievable.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But so quiet a man was Mr. Ward, that Dave’s courage returned.Besides, a new theory had suggested itself.The wild man was evidently Mr. Ward’s brother, a lunatic privately confined.Dave had heard of such things.Perhaps Mr. Ward wanted it kept quiet.That was why he had given him the twenty dollars.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">James G. Ward was forty years of age, a successful business man, and very unhappy.For forty years he had vainly tried to solve a problem that was really himself and that with increasing years became more and more a woeful affliction.In himself he was two men, and, chronologically speaking, these men were several thousand years or so apart.He had studied the question of dual personality probably more profoundly than any half dozen of the leading specialists in that intricate and mysterious psychological field.In himself he was a different case from any that had been recorded.Even the most fanciful flights of the fiction-writers had not quite hit upon him.He was not a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, nor was he like the unfortunate young man in Kipling’s “Greatest Story in the World.”His two personalities were so mixed that they were practically aware of themselves and of each other all the time.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">His other self he had located as a savage and a barbarian living under the primitive conditions of several thousand years before.But which self was he, and which was the other, he could never tell.For he was both selves, and both selves all the time.Very rarely indeed did it happen that one self did not know what the other was doing.Another thing was that he had no visions nor memories of the past in which that early self had lived.That early self lived in the present; but while it lived in the present, it was under the compulsion to live the way of life that must have been in that distant past.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在童年时代就是父母和家庭医生们的难题，但是对于他的古怪行为，他们却一点线索都没有发现。因此，他们不能理解为什么他在上午那么嗜睡，在晚上却过度活跃。当他们在夜晚发现他沿着走廊游荡，爬上令人晕眩的屋顶，或是在山间奔跑时，他们就认定他是一个梦游者。实际上，他的眼睛睁得大大的，很清醒，他只是出于远古自我的夜游强迫才出来游荡的。有一次，在一位蠢钝的医生的询问下，他曾说出实情，却受到了羞辱，它吐露的秘密被轻蔑地归类为“做梦”，不予考虑。</td>
		<td class="en">In his childhood he had been a problem to his father and mother, and to the family doctors, though never had they come within a thousand miles of hitting upon the clue to his erratic conduct.Thus, they could not understand his excessive somnolence in the forenoon, nor his excessive activity at night.When they found him wandering along the hallways at night, or climbing over giddy roofs, or running in the hills, they decided he was a somnambulist.In reality he was wide-eyed awake and merely under the night-roaming compulsion of his early self.Questioned by an obtuse medico, he once told the truth and suffered the ignominy of having the revelation contemptuously labeled and dismissed as “dreams.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The point was, that as twilight and evening came on he became wakeful.The four walls of a room were an irk and a restraint.He heard a thousand voices whispering to him through the darkness.The night called to him, for he was, for that period of the twenty-four hours, essentially a night-prowler.But nobody understood, and never again did he attempt to explain.They classified him as a sleep-walker and took precautions accordingly—precautions that very often were futile.As his childhood advanced, he grew more cunning, so that the major portion of all his nights were spent in the open at realizing his other self.As a result, he slept in the forenoons.Morning studies and schools were impossible, and it was discovered that only in the afternoons, under private teachers, could he be taught anything.Thus was his modern self educated and developed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There was one exception to the lack of memory of the life of his early self, and that was language.By some quirk of atavism, a certain portion of that early self’s language had come down to him as a racial memory.In moments of happiness, exaltation, or battle, he was prone to burst out in wild barbaric songs or chants.It was by this means that he located in time and space that strayed half of him who should have been dead and dust for thousands of years.He sang, once, and deliberately, several of the ancient chants in the presence of Professor Wertz, who gave courses in old Saxon and who was a philologist of repute and passion.At the first one, the professor pricked up his ears and demanded to know what mongrel tongue or hog-German it was.When the second chant was rendered, the professor was highly excited.James Ward then concluded the performance by giving a song that always irresistibly rushed to his lips when he was engaged in fierce struggling or fighting.Then it was that Professor Wertz proclaimed it no hog-German, but early German, or early Teuton, of a date that must far precede anything that had ever been discovered and handed down by the scholars.So early was it that it was beyond him; yet it was filled with haunting reminiscences of word-forms he knew and which his trained intuition told him were true and real.He demanded the source of the songs, and asked to borrow the precious book that contained them.Also, he demanded to know why young Ward had always posed as being profoundly ignorant of the German language.And Ward could neither explain his ignorance nor lend the book.Whereupon, after pleadings and entreaties that extended through weeks, Professor Wert took a dislike to the young man, believed him a liar, and classified him as a man of monstrous selfishness for not giving him a glimpse of this wonderful screed that was older than the oldest any philologist had ever known or dreamed.</td></tr>

Ward for visitation.The self first Mr. Ward knew was when he found him on his feet, quivering and tense, a surge of battle in his breast and on his lips the old war-chant.From without came a wild baying and bellowing of the hounds.And sharp as a knife-thrust through the pandemonium came the agony of a stricken dog—his dog, he knew.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他没停下来穿拖鞋和睡衣，直接从李星仔细锁好的那道门冲了出去，飞速奔下楼梯，没入到夜色中。就在他的光脚碰到碎石车道时，他突然停了下来，从台阶下那个熟悉的隐蔽处拉出一根巨大的多节棒——那是他的老朋友，曾陪伴他度过无数个在山间疯狂冒险的夜晚。猎狗们疯狂的喧叫声越来越近了，他挥舞着大棒，直接跳进灌木丛里去迎战那个不明物。</td>
		<td class="en">Not stopping for slippers, pajama-clad, he burst through the door Lee Sing had so carefully locked, and sped down the stairs and out into the night.As his naked feet struck the graveled driveway, he stopped abruptly, reached under the steps to a hiding-place he knew well, and pulled forth a huge knotty club—his old companion on many a mad night adventure on the hills.The frantic hullabaloo of the dogs was coming nearer, and, swinging the club, he sprang straight into the thickets to meet it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >被吵醒的住户们聚集在宽敞的阳台上。有人打开了灯，可除了他人惊慌的面孔，他们什么也看不到。在被照得通亮的车道的那一边，树木形成了一堵不可穿透的黑暗之墙。然而在那片黑暗中的某个地方，正在进行着一场可怕的厮杀。只听到动物惨烈的叫声、巨大的咆哮声和狂吠声、撞击声、沉重的身体压倒林下灌丛发出的哗啦声和撞击声。</td>
		<td class="en">The aroused household assembled on the wide veranda.Somebody turned on the electric lights, but they could see nothing but one another’s frightened faces.Beyond the brightly illuminated driveway the trees formed a wall of impenetrable blackness.Yet somewhere in that blackness a terrible struggle was going on.There was an infernal outcry of animals, a great snarling and growling, the sound of blows being struck and a smashing and crashing of underbrush by heavy bodies.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >打斗的浪潮从树阴下横扫出来，出现在旁观者们正下方的车道上。那时，他们什么都看到了。格斯戴尔夫人大叫起来，抓着她的儿子昏了过去。莉莲痉挛一般地握住栏杆，以至后来好多天她的手指尖上都留有淤青；她战栗地盯着一个黄毛大眼的巨人，认出那人就是她未来的丈夫。他正挥舞着一根巨大的棒子，冷静而凶猛地和一个毛发蓬乱的怪物打斗，那怪物比她见过的所有的熊都要大。那个野兽用爪子一把就撕走了沃德的睡衣，还在他身上留下一道道血口子。</td>
		<td class="en">The tide of battle swept out from among the trees and upon the driveway just beneath the onlookers.Then they saw.Mrs. Gersdale cried out and clung fainting to her son.Lilian, clutching the railing so spasmodically that a bruising hurt was left in her finger-ends for days, gazed horror-stricken at a yellow-haired, wild-eyed giant whom she recognized as the man who was to be her husband.He was swinging a great club, and fighting furiously and calmly with a shaggy monster that was bigger than any bear she had ever seen.One rip of the beast’s claws had dragged away Ward’s pajama-coat and streaked his flesh with blood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可莉莲·格斯戴尔大部分的恐惧来自于她深爱的那个男人，而大部分是由于他本人。她做梦都没有想到，在她未婚夫硬挺的衬衫和传统的西服下潜伏着一个如此巨大可怕的野人。至于男人是如何打斗的，她也完全没有概念。这种打斗显然不是现代的模式，可她在那里看到的并没有现代人，虽然连她自己也没意识到。因为这不是詹姆斯·J. 沃德先生，圣弗朗西斯科的那个商人，而是一个无名、陌生、残忍、粗鲁的野人，由于某个奇怪的机会，三生三世轮回几千年后又重生。</td>
		<td class="en">While most of Lilian Gersdale’s fright was for the man beloved, there was a large portion of it due to the man himself.Never had she dreamed so formidable and magnificent a savage lurked under the starched shirt and conventional garb of her betrothed.And never had she had any conception of how a man battled.Such a battle was certainly not modern; nor was she there beholding a modern man, though she did not know it.For this was not Mr. James J. Ward, the San Francisco business man, but one, unnamed and unknown, a crude, rude savage creature who, by some freak of chance, lived again after thrice a thousand years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >猎狗们依然疯狂地大叫着，团团围住打斗现场，或是冲进冲出去分散熊的注意力。就在那动物转身对付这些侧面袭击的时候，那个男人跳了进去，举着大棒打了下去。熊被这样一次次的袭击惹怒了，乱冲起来，那男人边跑边跳，避开猎狗，向后跑或是往这边或那边绕圈。于是，猎狗们借助空地的优势再次扑向灰熊，这把那只熊激怒了。</td>
		<td class="en">The hounds, ever maintaining their mad uproar, circled about the fight, or dashed in and out, distracting the bear.When the animal turned to meet such flanking assaults, the man leaped in and the club came down.Angered afresh by every such blow, the bear would rush, and the man, leaping and skipping, avoiding the dogs, went backwards or circled to one side or the other.Whereupon the dogs, taking advantage of the opening, would again spring in and draw the animal’s wrath to them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >结局来得很突然。那只熊转着身体，挥舞着用来押送它的大手铐，抓住了一条猎狗，狗的肋骨凹了进去，后背也受伤了，然后被扔出二十英尺。那个野蛮人愤怒极了。他愤怒地疯狂地叫喊着，声音含混不清，它扑上去的时候，双手奋力挥舞大棒，整个敲在正在起身的灰熊头上。即使是灰熊的头颅也根本禁不起这毁灭性的一击，接着它就倒在了慌乱的猎狗中。那男人跃过乱跑的猎狗，直接站在灰熊的尸体上，在白炽灯的照射下，他倚着大棒休息，唱着没人懂的胜利之歌——这首歌非常古老，沃茨教授愿意用十年的生命来换它。</td>
		<td class="en">The end came suddenly.Whirling, the grizzly caught a hound with a wide sweeping cuff that sent the brute, its ribs caved in and its back broken, hurtling twenty feet.Then the human brute went mad.A foaming rage flecked the lips that parted with a wild inarticulate cry, as it sprang in, swung the club mightily in both hands, and brought it down full on the head of the uprearing grizzly.Not even the skull of a grizzly could withstand the crushing force of such a blow, and the animal went down to meet the worrying of the hounds.And through their scurrying leaped the man, squarely upon the body, where, in the white electric light, resting on his club, he chanted a triumph in an unknown tongue—a song so ancient that Professor Wertz would have given ten years of his life for it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的看客们冲过来，围住他为他喝彩，可是詹姆斯·沃德突然透过古日耳曼人的双眼，看到那个脆弱的、他深爱着的20世纪的白人女子，接着大脑里的什么东西突然断了。他软弱无力地向他蹒跚走去，扔掉棍子，几乎就倒下了。他的身体有点不对劲。大脑疼痛难忍。好像他的灵魂要四处分散。他朝别人兴奋的眼神注视的方向望了一眼，看到那只熊的尸体。那场面让他害怕。他大叫一声，要不是他们抓着他，把他送进了小平房里，他早跑掉了。</td>
		<td class="en">His guests rushed to possess him and acclaim him, but James Ward, suddenly looking out of the eyes of the early Teuton, saw the fair frail Twentieth Century girl he loved, and felt something snap in his brain.He staggered weakly toward her, dropped the club, and nearly fell.Something had gone wrong with him.Inside his brain was an intolerable agony.It seemed as if the soul of him were flying asunder.Following the excited gaze of the others, he glanced back and saw the carcass of the bear.The sight filled him with fear.He uttered a cry and would have fled, had they not restrained him and led him into the bungalow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >詹姆斯·J. 沃德依然是沃德诺尔斯公司的领导。可他不再在乡下住了,晚上他也不会在夜晚追逐郊狼了。那晚在米尔山谷和熊搏斗完之后，他身体里的古日耳曼人就死去了。詹姆斯·J. 沃德现在是完整的詹姆斯·J. 沃德，他不再与来自远古时期、时空交错的流浪汗共用一个身体。现代版的詹姆斯·J. 沃德很完整，因此他也完全痛苦地体会到了文明社会的恐惧的魔咒。他现在害怕黑暗，他对夜晚的森林也是极度恐惧。他在市区的房子干净有序，他对防盗设施也很感兴趣。他的房间里布满了电线，一过睡觉时间，客人们几乎就连呼吸，都会触动警报。另外，他还发明了一种不用钥匙的门锁，旅行者们可以将其装在他们背心上的口袋里，这种锁可以在任何情况下即刻使用。可他妻子并不认为他是胆小鬼。她比别人更了解他。而他也同别的英雄一样，满足于自己已经取得的桂冠。了解米尔谷打斗的那些朋友们从不怀疑他的勇气。</td>
		<td class="en">James J. Ward is still at the head of the firm of Ward, Knowles & Co.But he no longer lives in the country; nor does he run of nights after the coyotes under the moon.The early Teuton in him died the night of the Mill Valley fight with the bear.James J. Ward is now wholly James J. Ward, and he shares no part of his being with any vagabond anachronism from the younger world.And so wholly is James J. Ward modern, that he knows in all its bitter fullness the curse of civilized fear.He is now afraid of the dark, and night in the forest is to him a thing of abysmal terror.His city house is of the spick and span order, and he evinces a great interest in burglarproof devices.His home is a tangle of electric wires, and after bed-time a guest can scarcely breathe without setting off an alarm.Also, he had invented a combination keyless door-lock that travelers may carry in their vest pockets and apply immediately and successfully under all circumstances.But his wife does not deem him a coward.She knows better.And, like any hero, he is content to rest on his laurels.His bravery is never questioned by those friends who are aware of the Mill Valley episode.</td></tr>
