		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时光旅行者（方便起见，这样称呼他）正在给我们解释一个深奥的问题。他灰色的眼睛此时闪着光芒，往常他总是面色苍白，这会儿却两颊泛着红光，富有生气。壁炉的火烧得很旺，银制的百合花形灯罩中，炽热的灯火散发出柔和的光晕，照在我们手中杯子里一闪即逝的气泡上。我们的座椅是时光旅行者的专利发明，不单是让人坐一坐那么简单，而是怀抱、轻抚着我们，十分舒适。晚饭后的气氛舒适惬意，大家畅快地交流思想，不必羁绊于表述的严谨。讲话中，关键的地方他总是用纤细的食指一顿。我们则坐在那里，懒洋洋地看着他专注地解释自己的新悖论（在我们看来如此），叹服他丰富的想象力。</td>
		<td class="en">The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们必须紧跟我的思路。我会推翻一两个几乎是普遍接受的观点。比如，你们在学校学的几何学，它的理论基础根本就是谬误。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从这个给我们讲起，是不是太大了点？”好争论的红头发菲尔比说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?’ said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不是说要你们接受任何观点，而不给你们合理的解释。你们很快就会承认我说的这些，正如我所期望的那样。想必大家都知道，数学上的一条线，一条高度为零的线，实际上是不存在的。数学课上都是这么教的吧？这样的一个平面也是不存在的。它们都不过是些抽象的概念而已。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错。”心理学家说道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘That is all right,’ said the Psychologist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一个立方体只具备长、宽、高，它就确实存在，这个说法也不对。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不这么认为，”菲尔比说道，“一个物体当然可能存在了。所有实实在在的物体——”</td>
		<td class="en">‘There I object,’ said Filby. ‘Of course a solid body may exist. All realthings—’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“大多数人都是这么认为的。不过先别急，你们说，一个转瞬即逝的立方体能真正存在吗？”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一个立方体持续的时间为零，它能真实存在吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >菲尔比陷入了沉思。时光旅行者继续说道：“显而易见，任何真实存在的物体都必须具有四个维度：长度、宽度、高度，还有——持续时间。但是由于人自身的缺陷，我们很容易忽视这个事实。至于这一缺陷，我稍后再给大家解释。事实上，确实有四个维度，其中三个就是我们称作构成空间的三个平面，而第四个就是时间。但是，因为我们的意识从生命开始到结束都是沿着时间维度朝一个方向断断续续地向前推进，因此人们往往容易把前面三个维度和时间维度区别开来，而这个区别是不真实的。”</td>
		<td class="en">Filby became pensive. ‘Clearly,’ the Time Traveller proceeded, ‘any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这，”一个年轻人说着，一再地想要用灯火重新点燃他的雪茄，“这个……的确无可置疑。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘That,’ said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; ‘that... very clear indeed.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是现在，很明显，这一点通常都被忽视了，”时光旅行者继续说道，脸上多了一分满意的微笑，“这才是第四维度的真正所指，尽管有些人谈论第四维度，却不知道他们所说的就是时间。其实这只是换一种角度看时间。除了我们的意识沿着时间流动外，时间与空间的其他三个维度毫无差别。不过有些愚蠢的人曲解了这个观点。你们都听过这些人关于第四维度的说法吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,’ continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. ‘Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我没有。”一个来自外省的市长先生说道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I have not,’ said the Provincial Mayor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“简单来说是这样的。按照数学家的说法，空间有三个维度，可以称为长度、宽度和高度。三个平面互相垂直就可以确定一个空间。但是一些哲学人士就一直有疑问：为什么就特定是三个维度呢？为什么不会有另外一个维度和这三个分别垂直呢？他们甚至尝试构造一个四维几何。就在大约一个月之前，西蒙. 尼科姆教授还在给纽约数学协会解释这个四维几何。大家都能理解在一个二维平面上，可以再现一个三维物体。同样道理，他们就想到利用三维模型，可以再现四维物体，只要掌握这个物体的透视法就行了。你们都明白了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a f lat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想是吧。”市长先生喃喃自语着。他紧锁眉头，自己反思着，嘴唇蠕动着，像是在那里叨念着什么咒语。沉默片刻，他忽然间恍然大悟道：“啊，现在我想明白了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I think so,’ murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. ‘Yes, I think I see it now,’ he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，我不介意告诉大家我从事四维几何的研究已经有一段时间了。我的一些研究结果十分新奇。比如，这里有一个八岁男孩的画像，还有他十五岁、十七岁、二十三岁等各年纪的画像。所有这些画像都明显是一个人的不同阶段，可以说，这就是用三维再现出来的四维生命体，而这四维生命体的存在是确定的、不容改变的事实。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >待大家揣摩片刻后，时光旅行者继续说道：“科学人士非常清楚，时间只是空间的一种。这里有一张常见的科学图表，是记录天气变化的。我手指定位的这条线显示了气压的变化情况。昨天显示气压是这么高，昨天晚上有所下降，今天早上又有上升，就像这样缓缓升到这里。无疑，水银的这条变化曲线不是沿着普遍认为的任何一个空间维度所形成的，对吧？但是，它又确实是沿着这样一条线而变化。因此，我们必然得出这样一个结论，这条线就是沿着时间维度而变化的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Scientific people,’ proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, ‘know very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是，”医生凝视着炉火中的煤块，问道，“如果说时间的确仅仅是空间的第四个维度，那它为什么总是一直被认为有所不同呢？在空间的其他几个维度中，我们可以自由移动，但在时间里为什么就不行呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But,’ said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, ‘if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时光旅行者笑着说：“你确定我们在空间里可以移动自如吗？左右移动不成问题，前进后退也毫无障碍，这些活动我们都经常做。我承认我们可以在两个维度中自由活动。但是我们也能自由地上天入地吗？地球引力把我们限制住了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The Time Traveller smiled. ‘Are you sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >医生反驳道：“也未必啊，气球就可以上天。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Not exactly,’ said the Medical Man. ‘There are balloons.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是在气球出现之前，除了蹦一蹦、跳一跳以及地势不平的原因外，人们是不能自由上下移动的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但还是能小幅上下移动的。”医生还不放弃。“落下来远比向上运动容易多了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Still they could move a little up and down,’ said the Medical Man. ‘Easier, far easier down than up.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在时间里根本无法移动，人不能脱离现在这一刻。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我亲爱的朋友，这正是你们的错误所在，也正是全世界的错误所在。实际上，我们经常逃离此刻。我们的精神存在是非物质形态的，不具有任何维度。从我们出生直到死亡，它都是沿着时间维度匀速向前的。就像我们如果身处地球表面五十英里上空的话就会向下降落一样。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present movement. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >心理学家打断道：“但是问题是，在空间的各个方向人都可以自由活动，而在时间里就不可以。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But the great difficulty is this,’ interrupted the Psychologist. ‘You can move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这正是我伟大发现的开始。但是你说我们在时间里无法自由移动可就不对了。例如，如果我正身临其境地回忆着过去的某件事，我就会回到它发生的那个瞬间。你们会说我心不在焉。有那么片刻，我跳回到了过去。当然，我们无法在过去停留哪怕一丁点儿的时间，就像一个野蛮人或是动物没法做到在离地面六英尺之上停留一分一秒一样。不过，在这方面，文明社会的人要比那些尚未开化的野蛮人强多了。既然他可以乘坐气球挣脱地球引力，为什么就不能期望最终在时间维度上停止或者做加速运动，甚至逆向运动呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，这个，”菲尔比禁不住说道，“都是——”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, this,’ began Filby, ‘is all—’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >话未说完，时光旅行者就打断道：“为什么不可以呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why not?’ said the Time Traveller.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这不合逻辑。”菲尔比回答说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘It’s against reason,’ said Filby.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么逻辑？”时光旅行者反问。</td>
		<td class="en">‘What reason?’ said the Time Traveller.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你可以把黑的说成是白的，但你永远不可能使我信服。”菲尔比斩钉截铁地说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You can show black is white by argument,’ said Filby, ‘but you will never convince me.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“也许是吧，”时光旅行者回答，“但是现在你们开始明白我研究四维几何的目的了。我很早之前就萌生念头，想发明一种机器——”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Possibly not,’ said the Time Traveller. ‘But now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去穿梭时空！”那个年轻人惊叫道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘To travel through Time!’ exclaimed the Very Young Man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“只要驾驶机器的人愿意，这个机器可以朝空间和时间的任意方向行进。”菲尔比自顾自地笑了笑。</td>
		<td class="en">‘That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driver determines.’ Filby contented himself with laughter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是我有实验为证。”时光旅行者说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘But I have experimental verification,’ said the Time Traveller.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >心理学家建议说：“有了这个机器，历史学家可就方便多了，比如，他可以回到过去，验证一下现在公认的关于黑斯廷斯战役的描述!”</td>
		<td class="en">‘It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,’ the Psychologist suggested. ‘One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings1, for instance!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你会因此而备受关注的，你不觉得吗？”医生说，“我们的先人可没有如此的宽宏大量，能容忍时光倒错的出现。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Don’t you think you would attract attention?’ said the Medical Man. ‘Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这样就可以通过听荷马和柏拉图的亲口传授，学习希腊语了。”年轻人一边思索着一边说道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,’ the Very Young Man thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那样的话，他们肯定会让你初试不及格的。要知道德国学者后来大大发展了希腊语。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The German scholars have improved Greek so much.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“人还可以去未来，”年轻人兴奋地说道，“想想看，你可以把积蓄都存起来，让它积累生息，然后再赶到未来去取款！”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Then there is the future,’ said the Very Young Man. ‘Just think! One might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可以看看严格按照共产主义理论建立的社会是什么样子的。”我说。“都是些异想天开的理论！”心理学家开始说道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘To discover a society,’ said I, ‘erected on a strictly communistic basis.’ ‘Of all the wild extravagant theories!’ began the Psychologist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，以前我也是这么觉得，因此，之前我从不谈论它，直到——”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—’</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“尽管我认为你是鬼话连篇，不过，无论如何，让我们来亲眼目睹你的实验吧。”心理学家说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Let’s see your experiment anyhow,’ said the Psychologist, ‘though it’s all humbug, you know.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时光旅行者微笑着环顾听者。他双手深深插在裤兜里，缓缓走出屋子，脸上依旧带着微笑。我们听到他拖着拖鞋，穿过长长的走廊，向实验室走去。</td>
		<td class="en">The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >心理学家看着我们说：“不知道他会拿什么东西出来？”</td>
		<td class="en">The Psychologist looked at us. ‘I wonder what he’s got?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可能是变个戏法或耍个花招什么的吧。”医生说。菲尔比想要给大家讲述他在波斯勒姆镇见到的一位魔术师，不过还没等他把开头讲完，时光旅行者就回来了，菲尔比的趣闻就此作罢。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,’ said the Medical Man, and Filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s anecdote collapsed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时光旅行者手里拿着一个金属构造的东西，闪闪发光，比一个小闹钟大不了多少，做得很是精巧。这个小东西里面有象牙和一些透明的晶状物体。从现在开始，我的叙述必须详尽，因为下面所发生的事情，除非我们认同旅行者的解释，否则简直不可思议。屋子里有一些小八角桌，他搬了一张放在壁炉前，有两个桌腿压在壁炉前的地毯上。时光旅行者把小装置放在桌子上，然后拉了一把椅子坐下来。除了那个小机器，桌上就只有一个带灯罩的小油灯，明亮的灯光落在那个机器模型上。房间里可能还有十来支蜡烛，有两个插在铜制的烛台上，摆在壁炉架上，还有一些插在壁式烛台上，所以照得整间屋子都亮堂堂的。我坐在一把不高的扶手椅上，离炉火最近。我又把椅子往前拉了拉，差不多坐在时光旅行者和壁炉中间了。菲尔比坐在旅行者后面，目光掠过他的肩膀看着实验。医生和市长先生从右侧，心理学家从他左侧观察着旅行者，那个年轻人则站在心理学家后面。我们都全神贯注。在这样的情形下，不管时光旅行者的把戏设计得有多么精妙，手法有多么灵巧，我也不相信他能瞒天过海，骗过我们这么多双眼睛。</td>
		<td class="en">The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时光旅行者看了看大家，然后把目光转向桌上的模型。“怎么样，开始吧？”心理学家说。</td>
		<td class="en">The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. ‘Well?’ said the Psychologist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个小东西，”时光旅行者把胳膊肘撑在桌面上，双手按在机器上说道，“只是一个模型，它是我计划穿越时光的一个机器雏形。你们可能会发现它看起来歪歪斜斜的，另外这根操纵杆闪闪发光，看起来有些奇怪，似乎有点像假的。”旅行者边说边用手指着那个部位，“这儿有一个小的白色操纵杆，这边还有一个。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘This little affair,’ said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, ‘is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way unreal.’ He pointed to the part with his finger. ‘Also, here is one little white lever, and here is another.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >医生站起身，过去盯着那个小东西仔细看，然后说：“制作得很精美。”</td>
		<td class="en">The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. ‘It’s beautifully made,’ he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我花了两年时间才做出来的。”时光旅行者回应道。等我们一个个都把那小东西细细端详一番后，时光旅行者说：“现在，我要你们都听明白，这个操作杆按下去后，机器就会驶向未来，而按下另外一个操纵杆，机器就会回到过去。穿越时空的人坐在里边的这个座位上。我马上就要按下第一个操纵杆，机器就会出发。它会突然消失，进入未来时空，然后就彻底消失了。你们可要仔细看看这个小东西，还有这张桌子，确信我没有使什么骗术。我可不想白白浪费了这个模型，结果还反被说成是个骗子。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘It took two years to make,’ retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: ‘Now I want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a quack.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大约有一分钟的光景大家都没有讲话。心理学家似乎想要跟我说些什么，却欲言又止。紧接着时光旅行者把手指伸向操纵杆，突然他又停了下来：“不，”他转向心理学家，“借用一下你的手。”就这样，时光旅行者攥着心理学家的手，并让他伸出食指。这样一来就是心理学家启动了时光机器模型，开始了漫无尽头的旅行。我们都亲眼目睹了操纵杆转动的瞬间。我百分之一百地肯定没有任何花招。我感到有一缕清风，灯火随之跳跃了一下。壁炉架上的蜡烛有一只被吹灭了。那个小机器突然开始转起圈来，变得模糊了，乍一看像个幽灵一般，黄铜色和象牙色闪闪发光，汇成令人晕眩的漩涡，接着就不见了——消失得无影无踪！除了那盏灯，桌子上空荡荡的什么也没有。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his finger towards the lever. ‘No,’ he said suddenly. ‘Lend me your hand.’ And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大家沉默了片刻。而菲尔比直骂自己该死。</td>
		<td class="en">Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >心理学家从恍惚中回过神来，突然低头往桌子底下看了看。这个举动引得时光旅行者开怀大笑。“怎么样？”他用之前心理学家的口吻说道。时光旅行者起身走到壁炉架前，那上面有一罐烟丝，他背对着我们，开始往自己烟斗里填烟丝。</td>

I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我觉得那时候，对于时光机器，我们谁也不是十分确信。事实上，时光旅行者这样的人太聪明了，反而让你不敢轻易相信：你总感到猜不透他，总怀疑在他坦诚无疑的表面背后内藏玄机，别有用心。如果换作是菲尔比给我们展示那个模型, 并用时光旅行者的话来解释这是怎么一回事的话，我们对他的怀疑就会少得多，因为我们一定会看穿他的动机，就连一个杀猪的都不会觉得菲尔比有什么难理解的。但是时光旅行者不一样，除了很多其他特质外，他的怪想法也很多，我们不相信他。放在一个不那么聪明的人身上觉得是很平常的事情，出自他手就感觉其中有诈。他错不该做什么事都那么轻而易举。认真的人仔细揣摩时光旅行者，却感觉从来也摸不透他的行为举止。然而，不知怎么的，他们却清楚，若是相信自己的明谋善断而信赖时光旅行者的行为，就好比是用薄如蛋壳的瓷器布置托儿所一般不可靠。所以，我想在接下来的一周里，我们都没怎么谈论时光旅行的事。尽管，毫无疑问，我们大多数人脑子里都想着它奇怪的可能性：它貌似有理，也就是说，实际上难以置信;它暗指穿越时代和时空混乱如此离谱的事情竟有可能发生。就我而言，我对那个模型的把戏格外感兴趣。周五我在林奈碰到医生时还和他讨论过那个东西。他说曾在图宾根见过类似的东西，还着重强调了蜡烛的熄灭，但是那把戏究竟是怎么一回事他也无法解释。</td>
		<td class="en">I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown him far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgement with him was like furnishing a nursery with egg-shell china. So I don’t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, inmost of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar thing at Tubingen,1 and laid considerable stress on the blowing out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.</td></tr>

The other men were Blank, the Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the ‘ingenious paradox and trick’ we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first. ‘Hallo!’ I said. ‘At last!’ And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. ‘Good heavens!

His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded.

For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.</td></tr>

He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face. ‘What on earth have you been up to, man?’ said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. ‘Don’t let me disturb you,’ he said, with a certain faltering articulation. ‘I’m all right.’ He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught. ‘That’s good,’ he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. ‘I’m going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things... Save me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.’</td></tr>

Again I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair of tattered blood-stained socks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested any fuss about himself.

		<td class="en">The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man, who rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while, with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. ‘Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? Or has he his Nebuchadnezzar2 phases?’ he inquired. ‘I feel assured it’s this business of the Time Machine,’ I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. ‘What was this time travelling? A man couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?’ And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature. ‘Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future?’ The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of journalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. ‘Our Special Correspondent in the Day After Tomorrow reports,’ the Journalist was saying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me.</td></tr>

The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away, and looked round us. ‘I suppose I must apologize,’ he said. ‘I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing time.’ He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. ‘But come into the smoking-room.

		<td class="en">‘Agreed,’ said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed ‘Agreed.’ And with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story!

There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday, when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!</td></tr>

Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door.

The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.</td></tr>

The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.</td></tr>

The whole surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and f lowing under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.</td></tr>

At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw aricher green flow up the hill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair.

So long as I traveled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light. The fact is that insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith.

I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones.

It was very large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx1, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a minute, perhaps, or half an hour.

There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within.

About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs.

Its triumph had not been simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time.

The too-perfect security of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had happened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from what I had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the by, was the name by which these creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the “Eloi,” the beautiful race that I already knew.</td></tr>

It was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like theCarolingian1 kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were becoming reacquainted with fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was at the time.</td></tr>

To me, at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the well.</td></tr>

Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I heard.</td></tr>

The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions4 and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics.</td></tr>

Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. “Dance,” I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest Cancan5, in part a step dance, in part askirt-dance6 (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you know.</td></tr>

Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite7 that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was in flammable and burned with a good bright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon.

I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took my fancy.</td></tr>

I shouted “Eureka!” and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence.

I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the other side.

Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward.

I seemed just to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was over powered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength.

Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then I recognized, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood in front.

This puzzled me very much at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“时光机器停在一个有坡度的海滩上。大海向西南方向延伸升起，与天空相接成一条地平线，在暗淡天空的映衬下显得非常明亮。空气中一丝风也没有，没有拍击海岸的巨浪，连波浪也没有。海里只有轻微的起伏，像油一样涌起落下，感觉像是大海微弱的呼吸，显示永恒的大海仍在活动，仍有生命。大海边缘不时地有海水涌出，那里结了厚厚的一层盐，在火红的天空下呈现出粉色。我脑中有种压迫的感觉，而且注意到自己的呼吸也非常急促。这种感觉使我想起我唯一的一次登山经历。由此，我判断这里的空气比我们现在的要稀薄得多。</td>
		<td class="en">‘The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从远处荒凉的斜坡上传来一声刺耳的尖叫。一个形似白色巨蝴蝶的东西歪斜着振翅飞起，在空中盘旋，消失在远处低矮的小丘之上。它的声音如此凄厉，听得我浑身颤抖，赶紧牢坐在机器上。再次环顾四周，我发现，之前我以为是一大块淡红色岩石的那个离我很近的东西正慢慢地朝我过来。那东西实际上是一个可怕的像螃蟹似的怪物。你能想象一只螃蟹和那边那张桌子一样大小吗？它的腿很多，缓慢地移动着，步伐不定。它挥舞着大钳子，长长的触须像车夫的鞭子一样在挥动摸索。金属似的面部两侧各有一只叶柄一样的眼睛，冲你闪着微光。在它的背部有一些波浪纹，点缀了许多绿色的斑痕，还有些突起的结疤，看上去十分笨拙。我可以看到，它爬行时结构复杂的嘴里伸出许多触须在扑动摸索。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and f littering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennae, like carters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“正当我盯着这个向我爬来的阴险幽灵时，突然感到脸颊上很痒痒，像是有只苍蝇在那里。我试着用手把它擦掉，但是不一会儿，它就又回来了，而且几乎同时耳朵那里又飞来一只。我用手去拍，抓到了一根线状的东西。它很快就从我手里抽了出去。带着极度的疑虑和不安，我转过身来，只见我刚刚抓住的是另一个螃蟹怪物的触须。它就站在我的身后：邪恶的眼睛在肉柄里慢慢地转动，饥饿全写在它的嘴上。它的两个大钳子上沾着海藻的黏液，正笨拙地朝我袭来。我立刻拉动操作杆，向前行进了一个月，但还是在这片海滩上。我一停下来就清楚地看到了那些螃蟹怪物。昏暗中，有几十只这样的怪物在层层鲜绿的叶片间爬来爬去。</td>
		<td class="en">‘As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“世界笼罩在一片肃杀荒凉之中，那感觉难以描述。天空，东边是红色的，北边则一片黑暗。含盐的死海；那些肮脏的怪物缓慢地爬行在石滩上；岩石上的苔藓类植物全都是一样的深绿色，看起来像是带有剧毒；伤及肺部的稀薄空气——所有这些景象无不令人心惊胆寒。我又向前驶进了一百年，周围的环境并没有什么变化——那轮红日只是稍微大了一些，暗淡了一些。大海依旧死气沉沉，空气依旧阴冷，陆上那群带壳的怪物仍旧出没在绿色的杂草和红色的岩石之间。西边的天空中，有一道淡淡的弧线，好似一弯巨大的新月。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a little duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacean creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“地球终极的命运之谜吸引着我继续向前，每跨越一千或一千多年之久我就停一停。眼前的景象令我异常着迷，西边的太阳渐渐变得越来越大，越来越暗，古老地球的生命也逐渐耗尽。最后，在长达三千多万年之后，太阳那个巨大的火球慢慢地模糊暗淡下去，几乎占了黑暗天空的十分之一。随后，我再次停住。地上已经看不到那些四处爬行的螃蟹了，红色的海滩上只剩下青绿色的叶苔和地衣，看起来毫无生气。现在，海滩上布满了白色的斑点，寒意袭人，不时可以看到片片罕见的白色雪花旋转着飘落下来。东北方向天空阴暗，星光照耀下，雪地发出一片亮光。我可以看到粉白色的丘陵轮廓绵延起伏。大海边缘结着一层层的冰，近岸的地方还飘着许多冰块，但是盐海的主海面还没有结冰。太阳永远地落了下去，海面上一片血红。</td>
		<td class="en">‘So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate, watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我环顾四周，看看还有没有任何动物存在的迹象。一种莫名的恐惧使我始终没有离开机器的鞍座。可是，不管是地上、天上，还是海里，我都没有看到任何活动的物体，只有岩石上那些绿色的黏液证明生命还没有消亡。海水已经退离了沙滩，海里出现了一个浅浅的沙洲。我仿佛看到有一个黑色的物体在岸上跳动，但是再仔细看时，它却一动不动了。我断定是自己看花眼了，那个黑色的东西只不过是一块岩石而已。天上的星星非常明亮，看起来似乎不怎么闪烁。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“突然，我意识到太阳西边的轮廓发生了变化，弧线上出现了一个凹面，好似一个小湾，而且凹陷越来越大。大约一分钟，我惊恐地看着眼前黑暗的幕布渐渐遮住了白天。随后，我意识到眼前正进行的是一次日食。月亮或水星正从太阳的圆盘前经过。当然了，一开始我以为是月亮，但是很多迹象使我相信，我看到的实际上是一个内行星凌日的过程，这个内行星经过太阳时，距离地球很近。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the sun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天色迅速变黑，东边吹来阵阵冷风，让人清醒。空中纷纷扬扬的白色雪花飘落得更加紧密。海边传来潺潺的水声和飒飒响声。除了这些没有生命的声音，世界一片寂静。寂静？真是难以形容那种静。所有的人声、咩咩的羊叫声、鸟鸣声、昆虫的嗡嗡声、耳边熟悉的喧闹声——所有构成我们生活的背景音，现在全都消失了。天越来越黑了，空中旋转的雪花下得越来越密，在我眼前飞舞。空中的寒气更加浓重了。远处小山的白顶终于也一个一个地，一个接着一个地迅速消失在黑暗之中。刚才的微风现在呼啸着呜咽起来。日食当中黑色的阴影向我横扫而来。不一会儿，就只能看到几颗苍白的星星。除此之外，一切都暗淡模糊，天空一片漆黑。</td>
		<td class="en">‘The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air in creased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.</td></tr>

Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it maybe, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.’</td></tr>
