		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When the man came out again into the yard, he asked the old wood-cutter how he was to stop the hand-mill, and when he had learned that, he thanked him and set off home with all the speed he could, but did not get there until after the clock had struck twelve on Christmas Eve.</td>
		<td class="en">当男人再次出来走进庭院时，他向砍柴老人打听如何才能使手摇磨盘停下来。他学会之后，便谢过老人，以最快的速度往家赶，但当他到家的时候，平安夜的钟早已敲完了十二下。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Where in the world have you been?” said the old woman.</td>
		<td class="en">“你究竟去了哪里？”老婆问，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Here I have sat waiting hour after hour, and have not even two sticks to lay across each other under the Christmas porridge-pot.”</td>
		<td class="en">“我已经坐在这儿等了好几个小时，平安夜用来熬粥的锅下面，连两根相互交叉的木棍都没有。”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“噢！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I could not come before; I had something of importance to see about, and a long way to go, too; but now you shall just see!”</td>
		<td class="en">我没能早点儿回来；我有重要的事情要做，也是为此走了好远；但是现在只要你瞧一瞧！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >said the man, and then he set the hand-mill on the table, and bade it first grind light, then a table-cloth, and then meat, and beer, and everything else that was good for a Christmas Eve’s supper; and the mill ground all that he ordered.</td>
		<td class="en">男人说完，就把手摇磨盘放到桌上，命令它先磨出灯，然后磨出一张桌布，接着是猪肉、啤酒，以及平安夜大餐所需的其他一切好东西；而磨盘也磨出了他所要求的全部东西。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Bless me!” said the old woman as one thing after another appeared; and she wanted to know where her husband had got the mill from, but he would not tell her that.</td>
		<td class="en">“上帝保佑！”当一件又一件东西出现的时候，老婆惊叫道；而且她想知道丈夫从哪里得来了这磨盘，但是他不告诉她。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Never mind where I got it; you can see that it is a good one, and the water that turns it will never freeze,” said the man.</td>
		<td class="en">“不要在意我是从哪里得来的；你能看到它是个好东西，而且使它运行的水永远不会结冰。”男人说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So he ground meat and drink, and all kinds of good things, to last all Christmas-tide, and on the third day he invited all his friends to come to a feast.</td>
		<td class="en">于是他磨出了猪肉和饮料，以及所有好东西，足够圣诞节期间享用。而且在第三天他邀请了所有朋友来参加宴席。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Now when the rich brother saw all that there was at the banquet and in the house, he was both vexed and angry, for he grudged everything his brother had.</td>
		<td class="en">如今，当富哥哥看到了宴席上和房子里的一切的时候，他又气又恼，因为他嫉妒他的弟弟拥有的一切。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“On Christmas Eve he was so poor that he came to me and begged for a trifle, for God’s sake, and now he gives a feast as if he were both a count and a king!” thought he.</td>
		<td class="en">“平安夜那天他那么穷，以上帝的名义来向我乞求一点儿吃的，而现在他却大摆宴席，好像既是位伯爵、国王似的！”他心想。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“But, for heaven’s sake, tell me where you got your riches from,” said he to his brother.</td>
		<td class="en">“但是，看在老天的面子上，告诉我你从哪儿得到的财富吧。”他对他的兄弟说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“From behind the door,” said he who owned the mill, for he did not choose to satisfy his brother on that point; but later in the evening, when he had taken a drop too much, he could not refrain from telling how he had come by the hand-mill.</td>
		<td class="en">“从门后面。”拥有磨盘的弟弟说，因为他不打算在这一点上满足他哥哥；但是那天晚上夜深以后，他喝多了酒，就忍不住说出自己是如何通过手摇磨盘得到这一切的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“There you see what has brought me all my wealth!” said he, and brought out the mill, and made it grind first one thing and then another.</td>
		<td class="en">“让你看看是什么给予我一切财富！”他一边说一边拿出了磨盘，命令它磨出一样又一样东西。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When the brother saw that, he insisted on having the mill, and after a great deal of persuasion got it; but he had to give three hundred dollars for it, and the poor brother was to keep it till the haymaking was over, for he thought: “If I keep it as long as that, I can make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long year.”</td>
		<td class="en">当富哥哥看到那情形，他坚持要占有磨盘，大费口舌之后终于达成了协议；但是他必须为此付出三百块钱，而穷弟弟要在干草收割结束之后才把磨盘给他，因为他想：“如果我还能把磨盘留那么长的时间，我就能让它磨出足够吃好多年的肉和饮料了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >During that time you may imagine that the mill did not grow rusty, and when hay-harvest came the rich brother got it, but the other had taken good care not to teach him how to stop it.</td>
		<td class="en">你可以想得到，那段时间里磨盘可没长锈，而到了收割干草的时候，富哥哥得到了它，但是穷弟弟故意没有教他怎么让它停下来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was evening when the rich man got the mill home, and in the morning he bade the old woman go out and spread the hay after the mowers, and he would attend to the house himself that day, he said.</td>
		<td class="en">富哥哥把磨盘带回家的时候是晚上，隔天早上他让老婆出去，去割草工后面摊晒干草，这样那天他就能自己在屋里了，他说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So, when dinner-time drew near, he set the mill on the kitchen-table, and said: “Grind herrings and milk pottage, and do it both quickly and well.”</td>
		<td class="en">于是，快要到吃饭的时候，他把磨盘放在厨房餐桌上，说：“磨鲱鱼和牛奶汤，要又快又好。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So the mill began to grind herrings and milk pottage, and first all the dishes and tubs were filled, and then it came out all over the kitchen-floor.</td>
		<td class="en">于是磨盘开始磨出鲱鱼和牛奶汤，一开始所有的盘子和水桶都装满了，然后溢了出来，厨房里满地都是。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The man twisted and turned it, and did all he could to make the mill stop, but, howsoever he turned it and screwed it, the mill went on grinding, and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the man was like to be drowned.</td>
		<td class="en">这个人又扭又转，费尽力气想将磨停下来，但是，不管他怎么转怎么扭，磨盘都不停地继续磨，很快汤就涨得很高，这个人简直要被淹死了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So he threw open the parlor door, but it was not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too, and it was with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the door-latch.</td>
		<td class="en">所以他打开了客厅的门，但是很快客厅也被填满了，男人顶着危险，克服困难才穿过奶汤流，抓住了门闩。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When he got the door open, he did not stay long in the room, but ran out, and the herrings and pottage came after him, and it streamed out over both farm and field.</td>
		<td class="en">当他打开门，他没有继续呆在屋里，而是跑了出去，那些鲱鱼和奶汤跟在他后面，流向了农田和原野。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Now the old woman, who was out spreading the hay, began to think dinner was long in coming, and said to the women and the mowers: “Though the master does not call us home, we may as well go.</td>
		<td class="en">现在，在外面晾干草的老婆开始意识到晚饭时间快到了，于是对旁边的女人和割草工说：“尽管当家的没有叫我们回家，我们也该走了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It may be that he finds he is not good at making pottage and I should do well to help him.”</td>
		<td class="en">也许他发现自己不擅长做汤，我应该去帮他。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So they began to straggle homeward, but when they had got a little way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread, all pouring forth and winding about one over the other, and the man himself in front of the flood.</td>
		<td class="en">于是，他们开始四散回家，但是当他们往山上走了一小段路之后便遇到了鲱鱼、汤、还有面包，它们争先恐后地涌过来，那个人就在这股洪流的最前面。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs!</td>
		<td class="en">“老天保佑你们每人都有一百个胃！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Take care that you are not drowned in the pottage!” he cried as he went by them as if Mischief were at his heels, down to where his brother dwelt.</td>
		<td class="en">小心不要淹死在汤里了！”他大叫这从他们身边跑过，身后像是紧跟着恶作剧先生，往他弟弟住的地方跑去了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then he begged him, for God’s sake, to take the mill back again, and that in an instant, for, said he: “If it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage.”</td>
		<td class="en">然后他乞求他，看在上帝的份上，赶快把磨收回去，因为，“要是它再多磨一小时，整片地区都要被鲱鱼和汤毁了。”他说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the brother would not take it until the other paid him three hundred dollars, and that he was obliged to do.</td>
		<td class="en">但是，除非哥哥付他300块钱，否则他不愿收回磨，而哥哥不得不给。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Now the poor brother had both the money and the mill again.</td>
		<td class="en">现在穷弟弟不但得到了钱，而且还再次得到了磨盘。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So it was not long before he had a farmhouse much finer than that in which his brother lived, but the mill ground him so much money that he covered it with plates of gold; and the farmhouse lay close by the sea-shore, so it shone and glittered far out to sea.</td>
		<td class="en">所以不久，他拥有了一座比他哥哥住的还要好的农舍，但磨盘给他磨出来的钱太多了，他只好把农舍用金砖包了起来；而且农舍离海岸很近，所以它闪闪发光，在海上很远的地方都能看见它的光芒。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man in the gold farmhouse, and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill, for the report of it spread far and wide, and there was no one who had not heard tell of it.</td>
		<td class="en">现在，每个航行经过那里的人都必定上岸拜访金农舍里的这位有钱人，而且每人都想看那神奇的磨盘，因为关于它的报道流传很广，无人不知，无人不晓。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >After a long, long time came also a skipper who wished to see the mill.</td>
		<td class="en">过了很长很长一段时间之后，一位船长也来了，他想看看磨盘。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He asked if it could make salt.</td>
		<td class="en">他问它是否能磨出盐。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Yes, it could make salt,” said he who owned it, and when the skipper heard that, he wished with all his might and main to have the mill, let it cost what it might, for, he thought, if he had it, he would get off having to sail far away over the perilous sea for freights of salt.</td>
		<td class="en">“是的，它能磨出盐。”它的主人说，而当船长听到那之后，他想倾其所有，不管花多大的代价都要得到那只磨盘，因为，他觉得，如果他能拥有它，他就不用在充满危险的大海上航行那么远去运盐了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At first the man would not hear of parting with it, but the skipper begged and prayed, and at last the man sold it to him, and got many, many thousand dollars for it.</td>
		<td class="en">一开始说要卖磨盘，男人只有拒绝，但是船长不断哀求祈祷，最后男人把磨盘卖给了他，同时得到了很多很多的钱。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When the skipper had got the mill on his back he did not stay there long, for he was so afraid that the man would change his mind, and he had no time to ask how he was to stop it grinding, but got on board his ship as fast as he could.</td>
		<td class="en">船长把磨盘背到背上，没有在那里逗留很久，因为他很害怕那个人会改变主意。他以最快的速度上了自己的船，也没时间问问如何使磨盘停下来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When he had gone a little way out to sea he took the mill on deck.</td>
		<td class="en">当他驶出海一段距离之后，他把磨盘放到了甲板上。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Grind salt, and grind both quickly and well,” said the skipper.</td>
		<td class="en">“磨盐，要又快又好。”船长说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So the mill began to grind salt, till it spouted out like water, and when the skipper had got the ship filled he wanted to stop the mill, but whichsoever way he turned it, and how much soever he tried, it went on grinding, and the heap of salt grew higher and higher, until at last the ship sank.</td>
		<td class="en">于是磨盘开始磨盐，直到像喷水一样，而当船长装满船的时候他想让磨盘停下来，但是无论他怎么转它，无论他费多大的劲，它还是不停地磨，那堆盐越堆越高，直到最后船沉了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There lies the mill at the bottom of the sea, and still, day by day, it grinds on; and that is why the sea is salt. </td>
