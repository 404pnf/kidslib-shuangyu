		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有个家伙走遍全国，”尼克森先生说，“进行巡回道德宗教展览——一种圣经故事的全景画展——他还雇了个愚蠢的老头给他做钢琴伴奏。头天晚上的演奏结束后，展览人对老头说：</td>
		<td class="en">“There was a fellow traveling around in that country,” said Mr. Nickerson, “with a moral-religious show—a sort of scriptural panorama—and he hired a wooden-headed old slab to play the piano for him.After the first night’s performance the showman says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘我的朋友，你好像对所有的曲调都非常熟悉，也总算出色地应付下来了。但是，不知你有没有意识到，昨晚你弹的那曲子有些时候不太得体，可以说——似乎和当时展出的画的整体步调不搭，可以说——有点儿偏离主题了，你知道——好像你的伴奏既没能锦上添花,也没能切中主题，我的意思你明白吗？’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘My friend, you seem to know pretty much all the tunes there are, and you worry along first rate.But then, didn’t you notice that sometimes last night the piece you happened to be playing was a little rough on the proprieties, so to speak—didn’t seem to jibe with the general gait of the picture that was passing at the time, as it were—was a little foreign to the subject, you know—as if you didn’t either trump or follow suit, you understand?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘哦，不，’那个家伙说，‘他没注意到，但也可能是这样吧；他也就是即兴弹弹而已。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Well, no,’ the fellow said; ‘he hadn’t noticed, but it might be; he had played along just as it came handy.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“于是两人达成共识，今后那个头脑简单的傻老头会密切注意观察全景图，只要有极好的画面放出来，他就用一首能帮助观众理解主题思想的曲子来点缀，热一热场，就像信仰复兴的野营布道会那样。那样的曲子可以得到观众们的共鸣，展览人说。</td>
		<td class="en">“So they put it up that the simple old dummy was to keep his eye on the panorama after that, and as soon as a stunning picture was reeled out he was to fit it to a dot with a piece of music that would help the audience to get the idea of the subject, and warm them up like a camp-meeting revival.That sort of thing would corral their sympathies, the showman said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那天晚上观众非常多——大部分都是中老年的教会成员，他们对和《圣经》有关的东西有着强烈的兴趣，其余的大多是年轻小伙子和姑娘们——他们总是一有全景画展就一定参加，你知道的，因为这给他们一个在黑暗中亲吻彼此脸颊的机会。</td>
		<td class="en">“There was a big audience that night—mostly middle-aged and old people who belong to the church, and took a strong interest in Bible matters, and the balance were pretty much young bucks and heifers—they always come out strong on panoramas, you know, because it gives them a chance to taste one another’s complexions in the dark.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，展览人开始为演说鼓足精神，那个糊涂老头则对着钢琴，手指上下比划了一两次，确保自己状态良好，而幕帘后面的伙计们则开始费力呈上全景画。展览人把重心移到右脚，双手叉腰，扭头看着画面，说道：</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, the showman began to swell himself up for his lecture, and the old mud-Jobber tackled the piano and ran his fingers up and down once or twice to see that he was all right, and the fellows behind the curtain commenced to grind out the panorama.The showman balanced his weight on his right foot, and propped his hands over his hips, and flung his eyes over his shoulder at the scenery, and said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘女士们、先生们，现在呈现在你们面前的图画刻画了浪子回头这一美丽动人的寓言故事。看那幸福的笑容正绽放在可怜的、饱受苦难的年轻人的脸上——他长途跋涉、又累又乏；再看年迈的父亲脸上扬起的狂喜笑容，还有一群少男少女们眼中闪烁着的喜悦，好像随时会有欢迎的歌曲通过他们双唇中蹦出来。朋友们，这个寓言神圣而有启发性，同时也是个美好、动人的故事。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Ladies and gentlemen, the painting now before you illustrates the beautiful and touching parable of the Prodigal Son.Observe the happy expression just breaking over the features of the poor, suffering youth—so worn and weary with his long march; note also the ecstasy beaming from the uplifted countenance of the aged father, and the joy that sparkles in the eyes of the excited group of youths and maidens, and seems ready to burst into the welcoming chorus from their lips.The lesson, my friends, is as solemn and instructive as the story is tender and beautiful.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那个糊涂老头已做好充分准备，在第二段演说结束时，他便开始演奏：</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，我们全都烂醉如泥，当约翰尼长途跋涉回到家中！</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, we’ll all get blind drunkWhen Johnny comes marching home!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一些人咯咯笑起来，一些人则不满地抱怨了一下。展览人一句话也说不出来；他狠狠地瞪了钢琴演奏者一眼，但他却全然一副愉快安详的样子——根本不知道有什么不对劲。</td>
		<td class="en">“Some of the people giggled, and some groaned a little.The showman couldn’t say a word; he looked at the pianist sharp, but he was all lovely and serene—he didn’t know there was anything out of gear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“全景图展示继续，展览人鼓起所有勇气重新开始介绍。</td>
		<td class="en">“The panorama moved on, and the showman drummed up his grit and started in fresh.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘女士们、先生们，现在徐徐呈现在各位面前的精美图画表现的是《圣经》历史上最引人瞩目的大事之一——我们的救世主和他的门徒穿越加利利海。这一主题激起了一种多么崇高、多么令人敬畏的情感啊！这一神圣作品的训诫向我们揭示出忠诚是何等高尚！救世主严厉谴责狂暴的海浪，他泰然自若地行走在深海的广阔表面之上！’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Ladies and gentlemen, the fine picture now unfolding itself to your gaze exhibits one of the most notable events in Bible history—our Saviour and His disciples upon the Sea of Galilee.How grand, how awe-inspiring are the reflections which the subject invokes!What sublimity of faith is revealed to us in this lesson from the sacred writings!The Saviour rebukes the angry waves, and walks securely upon the bosom of the deep!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“整个房间里的人们都在低声说：‘啊，真好，真美！’但乐队又开始演奏了：</td>
		<td class="en">“All around the house they were whispering, ‘Oh, how lovely, how beautiful!’ and the orchestra let himself out again:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“海浪中生活，波涛中为家！</td>
		<td class="en">“A life on the ocean wave,And a home on the rolling deep!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这下很多人毫不掩饰地窃笑起来，叹息声不绝于耳，一两个教会执事则站起来，走了出去。展览人气得咬牙切齿，在心里咒骂那个钢琴伴奏；可那家伙像木头疙瘩似的坐在那里，似乎还以为自己表现得出色呢。</td>
		<td class="en">“There was a good deal of honest snickering turned on this time, and considerable groaning, and one or two old deacons got up and went out.The showman grated his teeth, and cursed the piano man to himself; but the fellow sat there like a knot on a log, and seemed to think he was doing first-rate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“等大家平静下来后，展览人心想，不管怎样，他都要再努力一把，尽管他的信心已经开始剧烈动摇了。临时帮工们又开始费力拉出一幅全景画，展览人说道：</td>
		<td class="en">“After things got quiet the showman thought he would make one more stagger at it, anyway, though his confidence was beginning to get mighty shaky.The supes started the panorama grinding along again, and he says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘女士们、先生们，这幅精巧之作表现的是救世主让拉撒路死而复生的故事。这位画家采用了精妙绝伦的艺术技巧，他在画中倾注的温情表达是如此感人、如此细腻，我认识的一些特别多愁善感的人甚至看着画就被感动得流泪了。看那苏醒过来的拉撒路脸上半是迷惑半是询问的表情。再看看救世主的态度和表情，他一手轻轻地拉着拉撒路的衣袖，一手指着远处的城市。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Ladies and gentlemen, this exquisite painting represents the raising of Lazarus from the dead by our Saviour.The subject has been handled with marvelous skill by the artist, and such touching sweetness and tenderness of expression has he thrown into it that I have known peculiarly sensitive persons to be even affected to tears by looking at it.Observe the half-confused, half-inquiring look upon the countenance of the awakened Lazarus.Observe, also, the attitude and expression of the Saviour, who takes him gently by the sleeve of his shroud with one hand, while He points with the other toward the distant city.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没等大家从解说中反应过来，那头无知的老驴就在钢琴上又弹了起来：</td>
		<td class="en">“Before anybody could get off an opinion in the case the innocent old ass at the piano struck up:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“站起来吧，威廉·赖—利，随我一起离开吧！’</td>
		<td class="en">“Come rise up, William Ri-i-ley,And go along with me!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哟—唷！所有坐着的板着脸的老人都站起来，愤然离去，其他人则全都放声大笑，震得窗户直响。</td>
		<td class="en">“Whe-ew!All the solemn old flats got up in a huff to go, and everybody else laughed till the windows rattled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“展览人走下台，一把抓住乐师，摇着他说道：</td>
		<td class="en">“The showman went down and grabbed the orchestra and shook him up and says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘这下请你出去，你知道，你这个满脑子浆糊的呆子。去门房领你的钱,然后就给我滚——快滚回老家牧场去吧！女士们、先生们，由于发生了我无力掌控的局面，我不得不提前结束展览。’”</td>
		<td class="en">“‘That lets you out, you know, you chowder-headed old clam.Go to the doorkeeper and get your money, and cut your stick—vamose the ranch!Ladies and gentlemen, circumstances over which I have no control compel me prematurely to dismiss the house.’”</td></tr>
