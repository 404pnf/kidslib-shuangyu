		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >181-年的10月初，英国军队里一位尊贵的爱尔兰籍军官托马斯·内维尔上校同他的女儿下榻在马赛的博沃旅馆，他们刚从意大利旅游归来。狂热的游客对意大利无休止的普遍的赞美却发生了反效果。现在，许多旅客为了显得与众不同，开始把贺拉斯的无动于衷视为座右铭。上校的独生女莉迪娅小姐便属于这一类不满意的游客。她觉得《耶稣变容》这幅名画平淡无奇，喷发的维苏威火山也比伯明翰的工厂烟囱壮观不到哪里去。总的来说，她对意大利最大的不满就是它缺乏地方特色和个性。对于她这些话，我的读者们必须尽最大努力自己去理解。　几年前我还很能理解这些话，但现在我自己都不懂了。一开始，莉迪娅小姐还洋洋自得地以为自己在阿尔卑斯山的另一边找到了别人从没见过的事物，可以与茹尔丹先生口中的“君子”们谈论一番。可她很快就发现，自己无论在哪一方面都被她的同胞抢了先，不可能有任何新发现了，于是她也加入了反对派一方。最令人讨厌的是，你一说起意大利的奇观，一定会有人问你：“那你肯定见过某某宫殿里的那幅拉斐尔名画了吧？那可是全意大利最美轮美奂的东西！”可你就偏偏没注意到这幅画。既然看完所有的东西太费时间，那么最简单的办法便是刻意否定一切。</td>
		<td class="en">Early in the month of October, 181-, Colonel Sir Thomas Nevil, a distinguished Irish officer of the English army, alighted with his daughter at the Hotel Beauveau, Marseilles, on their return from a tour in Italy.The perpetual and universal admiration of enthusiastic travellers has produced a sort of reaction, and many tourists, in their desire to appear singular, now take the nil admirari of Horace for their motto.To this dissatisfied class the colonel’s only daughter, Miss Lydia, belonged.“The Transfiguration” has seemed to her mediocre, and Vesuvius in eruption an effect not greatly superior to that produced by the Birmingham factory chimneys.Her great objection to Italy, on the whole, was its lack of local colour and character.My readers must discover the sense of these expressions as best they may.A few years ago I understood them very well myself, but at the present time I can make nothing of them.At first, Miss Lydia had flattered herself she had found things on the other side of the Alps which nobody had ever before seen, about which she could converse avec les honnetes gens, as M. Jourdain calls them.But soon, anticipated in every direction by her countrymen, she despaired of making any fresh discoveries, and went over to the party of the opposition.It is really very tiresome not to be able to talk abut the wonders of Italy without hearing somebody say “Of course you know the Raphael in the Palazzo—at—?It is the finest thing in Italy!” and just the thing you happen to have overlooked!As it would take too long to see everything, the simplest course is to resort to deliberate and universal censure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在博沃旅馆里，莉迪娅小姐就碰到一件叫人沮丧的事。她带回来一幅漂亮的素描，画的是塞尼城的佩拉斯吉式的城门，也被称为巨石门。她相信别的艺术家肯定完全没注意到它。可不久之前，就在马赛，她遇见了弗朗西丝·芬威克夫人，夫人给她展示自己的纪念册时，在一首十四行诗和一支枯萎的花之间就出现了上面所说的那扇门，还被涂上了亮丽的黄褐色。莉迪娅小姐一气之下，把她的画给了贴身女仆——从此对佩拉斯吉式建筑也失去了兴趣。</td>
		<td class="en">At the Hotel Beauveau Miss Lydia met with a bitter disappointment.She had brought back a pretty sketch of the Pelasgic or Cyclopean Gate at Segni, which, as she believed, all other artists had completely overlooked.Now, at Marseilles, she met Lady Frances Fenwick, who showed her her album, in which appeared, between a sonnet and a dried flower, the very gate in question, brilliantly touched in with sienna.Miss Lydia gave her drawing to her maid—and lost all admiration for Pelasgic structures.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >内维尔上校也染上了这不愉快的心境，因为自从他妻子过世后，他看一切事情都是依照女儿的眼光。在他看来，意大利让他的女儿烦闷，便是犯下了最不可饶恕的罪过，因此也就成为了这世上最讨厌的国家。确实，他对那些绘画和雕塑找不出什么缺点，但他确定在意大利打猎是最糟糕的了，他必须顶着烈日在罗马的旷野跋涉10里格，才能打到几只没什么价值的红腿山鹑。</td>
		<td class="en">This unhappy frame of mind was shared by Colonel Nevil, who, since the death of his wife, looked at everything through his daughter’s eyes.In his estimation, Italy had committed the unpardonable sin of boring his child, and was, in consequence, the most wearisome country on the face of the earth.He had no fault to find, indeed, with the pictures and statues, but he was in a position to assert that Italian sport was utterly wretched, and that he had been obliged to tramp ten leagues over the Roman Campagna, under a burning sun, to kill a few worthless red-legged partridges.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到达马赛后的第二天早晨，他便邀请曾做过他副官的埃利斯上尉吃饭。上尉刚在科西嘉岛呆了六个星期。上尉给莉迪娅小姐讲了个有关强盗的故事，他讲得很精彩，而且和她以前从那不勒斯到罗马一路反复听到的强盗故事完全不同。吃过饭，两位男士又留下来用甜点，他们边喝红酒边谈论着狩猎——上校了解到科西嘉岛是狩猎的绝佳地点，猎物之丰富，种类之繁多，没有哪个地方能比得上那里。“那儿有很多野猪。”埃利斯上尉说道，“你必须学会把它们同家猪区分开来，因为两者实在是惊人地相像。要是你误杀了家猪，那可就给自己惹麻烦了，养猪人会找上你。他们全副武装地从灌木丛（也就是他们所说的“马基”）中冲出来，要求你赔偿他们的牲口，还会嘲笑你一番。另外，那里还有一种奇怪的动物，叫摩弗伦羊，你在别的地方是看不到的——这可是上好的猎物，不过很难打到——当然还有牡鹿、鹿、野鸡、山鹑等等。总之，科西嘉岛的猎物种类繁多，数都数不过来。上校，如果你想打猎，一定要去科西嘉！就像款待我的一个人所说的，在那里你想打什么猎物都能打得到，从画眉鸟到人都行！”</td>
		<td class="en">The morning after his arrival at Marseilles he invited Captain Ellis—his former adjutant, who had just been spending six weeks in Corsica—to dine with him.The captain told Miss Lydia a story about bandits, which had the advantage of bearing no resemblance to the robber tales with which she had been so frequently regaled, on the road between Naples and Rome, and he told it well.At dessert, the two men, left alone over their claret, talked of hunting—and the colonel learned that nowhere is there more excellent sport, or game more varied and abundant, than in Corsica.“There are plenty of wild boars,” said Captain Ellis.“And you have to learn to distinguish them from the domestic pigs, which are astonishingly like them.For if you kill a pig, you find yourself in difficulties with the swine-herds.They rush out of the thickets (which they call maquis) armed to the teeth, make you pay for their beasts, and laugh at you besides.Then there is the mouflon, a strange animal, which you will not find anywhere else—splendid game, but hard to get—and stags, deer, pheasants, and partridges—it would be impossible to enumerate all the kinds with which Corsica swarms.If you want shooting, colonel, go to Corsica!There, as one of my entertainers said to me, you can get a shot at every imaginable kind of game, from a thrush to a man!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >喝茶的时候，上尉又讲了一个血亲间的复仇故事（世仇就是向最初的冒犯者的远亲或者近亲复仇），莉迪娅小姐甚是喜欢，因为这个故事比先前那个还要新奇，他所描述的那片有着奇特奔放之美的乡村、村民们怪异的性格以及他们古朴的好客风气和习俗，把莉迪娅小姐对科西嘉的热情煽动得异常高涨。最后，上尉还送给她一把漂亮的小匕首，它的形状和镶着铜的把手虽然不俗，但更不平凡的还是它的来历。它是一个著名的强盗送给埃利斯上尉的，强盗还信誓旦旦地说这把匕首刺过四个人。莉迪娅小姐把匕首插在腰带上，一并放在床头柜上，睡觉前还把它从刀鞘里抽出来看了好几次。而她的父亲这时正梦见他杀死了一只摩弗伦羊，羊的主人要他赔偿，他很乐意地就照付了，因为那是一只非常怪异的野兽，身体像野猪，却长着牡鹿的角和野鸡的尾巴。</td>
		<td class="en">At tea, the captain once more delighted Lydia with the tale of a vendetta transversale (A vendetta in which vengeance falls on a more or less distant relation of the author of the original offence.), even more strange than his first story, and he thoroughly stirred her enthusiasm by his descriptions of the strange wild beauty of the country, the peculiarities of its inhabitants, and their primitive hospitality and customs.Finally, he offered her a pretty little stiletto, less remarkable for its shape and copper mounting than for its origin.A famous bandit had given it to Captain Ellis, and had assured him it had been buried in four human bodies.Miss Lydia thrust it through her girdle, laid it on the table beside her bed, and unsheathed it twice over before she fell asleep.Her father meanwhile was dreaming he had slain a mouflon, and that its owner insisted on his paying for it, a demand to which he gladly acceded, seeing it was a most curious creature, like a boar, with stag’s horns and a pheasant’s tail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >隔天早晨，上校和女儿两人单独吃早饭的时候，上校提道：“听埃利斯讲，科西嘉岛上有丰富的猎物。要不是距离太远，我倒很想到那里呆上两周。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ellis tells me there’s splendid shooting in Corsica,” said the colonel, as he sat at breakfast, alone with his daughter.“If it hadn’t been for the distance, I should like to spend a fortnight there.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可以啊，”莉迪娅回答，“我们为什么不到科西嘉去呢？你在那里打猎的时候，我可以画画素描——我很想把埃利斯上尉说到的那个洞穴画到我的纪念册上，据说那里还是拿破仑小时候经常读书的地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well,” replied Miss Lydia, “why shouldn’t we go to Corsica?While you are hunting I can sketch—I should love to have that grotto Captain Ellis talked about, where Napoleon used to go and study when he was a child, in my album.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上校的想法竟然得到了女儿的赞同，这大概还是第一次。上校对这意想不到的意见一致感到十分高兴，但他还是明智地说出了种种反对意见，以便激起莉迪娅小姐欣然接受的一时兴致。他指出那是个荒蛮的地方，女人到那里旅行有很大困难。可莉迪娅小姐根本听不进去。她什么都不怕，她最喜欢骑马旅行，想到在野外安营露宿就开心，她甚至说连小亚细亚都想去——总之，她总能把你驳倒。因为从来没有英国女人去过科西嘉岛，所以她一定要去。将来回到圣詹姆斯广场，把她的纪念册展示给别人看，那该有多么得意啊！“亲爱的，为什么你这么快就把这幅漂亮的画翻过去了？”“那张画不算什么，不过是我的一张速写罢了，画的是为我们当向导的一个著名科西嘉强盗。”“什么！你是说你到过科西嘉？”</td>
		<td class="en">It was the first time, probably, that any wish expressed by the colonel had won his daughter’s approbation.Delighted as he was by the unexpected harmony on their opinions, he was nevertheless wise enough to put forward various objections, calculated to sharpen Miss Lydia’s welcome whim.In vain did he dwell on the wildness of the country, and the difficulties of travel there for a lady.Nothing frightened her; she liked travelling on horseback of all things; she delighted in the idea of bivouacking in the open; she even threatened to go as far as Asia Minor—in short, she found an answer to everything.No Englishwoman had ever been to Corsica; therefore she must go.What a pleasure it would be, when she got back to St. James’s Place, to exhibit her album!“But, my dear creature, why do you pass over that delightful drawing?”“That’s only a trifle—just a sketch I made of a famous Corsican bandit who was our guide.”“What!You don’t mean to say you have been to Corsica?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于当时从法国到科西嘉岛还没有汽船，他们就到处打听有没有即将启航的帆船，能带莉迪娅小姐去她想去的那座岛屿探险。当天，上校写信去巴黎，退掉了本来预定要住一段时间的房间，又同一个科西嘉纵帆船的船长谈妥了价钱。他们的船要去阿雅克肖，船上有两个简陋的船舱，不过，这已是能找到的最好的了。船上储备充足，船长极力保证说他有个很优秀的厨师，他烧的普鲁旺斯鱼汤无人能及。而且船长还保证，小姐在船上一定会很舒服，一路上必定风平浪静。</td>
		<td class="en">As there were no steamboats between France and Corsica, in those days, inquiries were made for some ship about to sail for the island Miss Lydia proposed to discover.That very day the colonel wrote to Paris, to countermand his order for the suite of apartments in which he was to have made some stay, and bargained with the skipper of a Corsican schooner, just about to set sail for Ajaccio, for two poor cabins, but the best that could be had.Provisions were sent on board, the skipper swore that one of his sailors was an excellent cook, and had not his equal for bouilleabaisse; he promised mademoiselle should be comfortable, and have a fair wind and a calm sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >遵照他女儿的意愿，上校还规定船长不得再搭载任何其他旅客，而且必须沿着岛的海岸行驶，以便莉迪娅小姐观赏山景。</td>
		<td class="en">The colonel further stipulated, in obedience to his daughter’s wishes, that no other passenger should be taken on board, and that the captain should skirt the coast of the island, so that Miss Lydia might enjoy the view of the mountains.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二章</td>
		<td class="en">Chapter II</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >出发那天，一大早所有的东西就被打包好装上船。纵帆船要等到傍晚起风时才启航。此时，上校和他女儿正在卡纳比埃大街上散步，船主叫住了他们，恳求上校准许他搭载一个亲戚，此人是他长子的教父的二表弟，有重要的事情需赶回科西嘉故乡，却苦于找不到可以搭乘的船。</td>
		<td class="en">On the day of their departure everything was packed and sent on board early in the morning.The schooner was to sail with the evening breeze.Meanwhile, as the colonel and his daughter were walking on the Canebiere, the skipper addressed them, and craved permission to take on board one of his relations, his eldest son’s godfather’s second cousin, who was going back to Corsica, his native country, on important business, and could not find any ship to take him over.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是个可爱的小伙子，”马泰船长补充道，“也是军人，在近卫队步兵团里当军官，如果那一位（指拿破仑）还做着皇帝的话，他可能已经是上校了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“He’s a charming fellow,” added Captain Mattei, “a soldier, an officer in the Infantry of the Guard, and would have been a colonel already if the other (meaning Napoleon) had still been emperor!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“既然他也是个军人……”上校开口正想接着说“我很愿意他跟我们一起走”时，莉迪娅小姐已经用英语大声说道：</td>
		<td class="en">“As he is a soldier,” began the colonel—he was about to add, “I shall be very glad he should come with us,” when Miss Lydia exclaimed in English:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一个步兵军官！”（她父亲曾在骑兵团里服役，因此她瞧不起其他任何兵种。）“他很可能没受过教育，没准还会晕船，这样就把我们旅行的快乐全毁了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“An infantry officer!”(Her father had been in the cavalry, and she consequently looked down on every other branch of the service.) “An uneducated man, very likely, who would be sea-sick, and spoil all the pleasure of our trip!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >船长听不懂半点英语，但从莉迪娅小姐撅起的美丽的嘴唇，似乎也明白了她的意思，于是立刻把他的那位亲戚仔仔细细地夸耀了一番，最后保证说他亲戚是个绅士，他们家个个都当过士官，而且绝对不会妨碍上校，因为他，船主，会负责把他安置在一个角落里，让大家意识不到他的存在。</td>
		<td class="en">The captain did not understand a word of English, but he seemed to catch what Miss Lydia was saying by the pursing up of her pretty mouth, and immediately entered upon an elaborate panegyric of his relative, which he wound up by declaring him to be a gentleman, belonging to a family of corporals, and that he would not be in the very least in the colonel’s way, for that he, the skipper, would undertake to stow him in some corner, where they should not be aware of his presence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上校和内维尔小姐听说科西嘉人竟然有世代相传的士官家庭，都觉得有些奇怪。但是，他们真的就相信了这个人大概就是个步兵下士，并断定船主肯定纯粹是出于好心才捎带上这么一个穷鬼。假如是个军官，他们免不了要同他交际应酬，但若只是个下士，就省掉麻烦了——因为下士本是无足轻重的人物，只有当他带着手下的兵和上了刺刀的枪，押送一个不情愿的人去某个地方时，才算有些威风。</td>
		<td class="en">The colonel and Miss Nevil thought it peculiar that there should be Corsican families in which the dignity of corporal was handed down from father to son.But, as they really believed the individual in question to be some infantry corporal, they concluded he was some poor devil whom the skipper desired to take out of pure charity.If he had been an officer, they would have been obliged to speak to him and live with him; but there was no reason why they should put themselves out for a corporal—who is a person of no consequence unless his detachment is also at hand, with bayonets fixed, ready to convey a person to a place to which he would rather not be taken.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的亲戚晕船吗？”内维尔小姐直截了当地问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is your kinsman ever sea-sick?” demanded Miss Nevil sharply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“绝对不会晕船，小姐。不管在海上或是陆地上，他都坚如磐石！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Never, mademoiselle, he is as steady as a rock, either on sea or land!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那好吧，你可以带上他。”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Very good then, you can take him,” said she.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你可以带上他！”上校也跟着说了一句，然后继续走他们的路。</td>
		<td class="en">“You can take him!” echoed the colonel, and they passed on their way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >傍晚快五点的时候，马泰船长过来护送他们上船。码头上，他们在船长的轻便快艇附近遇到了一个身材高挑的青年，他身穿一件蓝色长外衣，扣子一直扣到下巴，脸晒成了棕褐色，黑色的大眼睛炯炯有神，从整个外表判断，这人是个聪明而直率的人。他微微后缩的肩膀和卷曲的小胡子，都清楚地表明他肯定是个军人——因为，那时候留胡子还不是普遍的做法，国民近卫队士兵们的习惯和装扮还没被传入寻常百姓家。</td>
		<td class="en">Toward five o’clock in the evening Captain Mattei came to escort them on board the schooner.On the jetty, near the captain’s gig, they met a tall young man wearing a blue frock-coat, buttoned up to his chin; his face was tanned, his eyes were black, brilliant, wide open, his whole appearance intelligent and frank.His shoulders, well thrown back, and his little twisted mustache clearly revealed the soldier—for at that period mustaches were by no means common, and the National Guard had not carried the habits and appearance of the guard-room into the bosom of every family.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >青年看到上校，立刻脱下帽子，措辞得体、落落大方地感谢上校给予他的帮助。</td>
		<td class="en">When the young man saw the colonel he doffed his cap, and thanked him in excellent language, and without the slightest shyness, for the service he was rendering him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很高兴能帮你忙，我的同伴！”上校边说边友好地点了点头，然后上了船。</td>
		<td class="en">“Delighted to be of use to you, my good fellow!” said the colonel, with a friendly nod, and he stepped into the gig.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的这位英国朋友不是很拘礼。”青年低声用意大利语对船长说。</td>
		<td class="en">“He’s not very ceremonious, this Englishman of yours,” said the young man in Italian, and in an undertone, to the captain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >船主把食指放在左眼下方，嘴角微微向下一弯。懂得肢体语言的人都知道，船长的意思是：这个英国人懂意大利语，而且还是个怪人。青年微微一笑，用手触了触前额，以回应马泰的手势，意思是：英国人的想法都比较古怪。接着，他在他们旁边坐下，开始仔细打量他标致的女伴，但又并不显得失礼。</td>
		<td class="en">The skipper laid his forefinger under his left eye, and pulled down the corners of his mouth.To a man acquainted with the language of signs, this meant that the Englishman understood Italian, and was an oddity into the bargain.The young man smiled slightly and touched his forehead, in answer to Mattei’s sign, as though to indicate that every Englishman had a bee in his bonnet.Then he sat down beside them, and began to look very attentively, though not impertinently, at his pretty fellow-traveller.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“法国士兵都有副好的外表，”上校用英语对他女儿说道，“因此他们很容易被提升为军官。”然后，他又用法语对青年说：“朋友，告诉我，你在哪个部队里服过役？”青年用手肘轻轻地碰了碰他二表兄教子的父亲，忍住嘲讽的微笑，回答说他在近卫队步兵团服役，最近刚刚离开第七轻装营。</td>
		<td class="en">“These French soldiers all have a good appearance,” remarked the colonel in English to his daughter, “and so it is easy to turn them into officers.”Then addressing the young man in French, he said, “Tell me, my good man, what regiment have you served in?”The young man nudged his second cousin’s godson’s father gently with his elbow, and suppressing an ironic smile, replied that he had served in the Infantry of the Guard, and that he had just quitted the Seventh Regiment of Light Infantry.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">His careless air, his frank and good humour, which had at first impressed her so unfavourably, now seemed to her an additional merit, as being proofs of the deep dissimulation of a strong nature, which will not allow any inner feeling to appear upon the surface.Orso seemed to her a sort of Fieschi, who hid mighty designs under an appearance of frivolity, and, though it is less noble to kill a few rascals than to free one’s country, still a fine deed of vengeance is a fine thing, and besides, women are rather glad to find their hero is not a politician.Then Miss Nevil remarked for the first time that the young lieutenant had large eyes, white teeth, an elegant figure, that he was well-educated, and possessed the habits of good society.During the following day she talked to him frequently, and found his conversation interesting.He was asked many questions about his own country, and described it well.Corsica, which he had left when young, to go first to college, and then to the Ecole militaire, had remained in his imagination surrounded with poetic associations.When he talked of its mountains, its forests, and the quaint customs of its inhabitants he grew eager and animated.As may be imagined, the word vengeance occurred more than once in the stories he told—for it is impossible to speak of the Corsicans without either attacking or justifying their proverbial passion.Orso somewhat surprised Miss Nevil by his general condemnation of the undying hatreds nursed by his fellow-countrymen.As regarded the peasants, however, he endeavoured to excuse them, and claimed that the vendetta is the poor man’s duel.“So true is this,” he said, “that no assassination takes place till a formal challenge has been delivered.‘Be on your guard yourself, I am on mine!’ are the sacramental words exchanged, from time immemorial, between two enemies, before they begin to lie in wait for each other.There are more assassinations among us,” he added, “than anywhere else.But you will never discover an ignoble cause for any of these crimes.We have many murderers, it is true, but not a single thief.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The next day, a short time before the sportsmen came back, Miss Nevil, returning with her maid from a walk along the seashore, was just about to enter the inn, when she noticed a young woman, dressed in black, riding into the town on a small but strong horse.She was followed by a sort of peasant, also on horseback, who wore a brown cloth jacket cut at the elbows.A gourd was slung over his shoulder and a pistol was hanging at his belt, his hand grasped a gun, the butt of which rested in a leathern pocket fastened to his saddle-bow—in short, he wore the complete costume of a brigand in a melodrama, or of the middle-class Corsican on his travels.Miss Nevil’s attention was first attracted by the woman’s remarkable beauty.She seemed about twenty years of age; she was tall and pale, with dark blue eyes, red lips, and teeth like enamel.In her expression pride, anxiety, and sadness were all legible.On her head she wore a black silk veil called a mezzaro, which the Genoese introduced into Corsica, and which is so becoming to women.Long braids of chestnut hair formed a sort of turban round her head.Her dress was neat, but simple in the extreme.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >内维尔小姐有足够的时间来观察她，因为这位戴梅纱罗的女士已经停在街上，正向人打听什么。从她的眼神看得出，一定是有极其重要的事。之后，在得到别人的回答后，她用马鞭抽了一下坐骑，马儿快步小跑起来，直奔到托马斯·内维尔先生和奥索住的旅馆门口才停下来。到了那里，女孩和旅馆主人说了几句话，然后轻巧地从马鞍上跳下来，坐在门口的一张石凳上，她的马夫便牵着马进了马厩。莉迪娅小姐一身巴黎女装从陌生女子旁边走过，那位女子也没有抬起眼睛看。过了一刻钟，莉迪娅小姐打开窗户，看见那个戴梅纱罗的女子依然保持着那个姿态坐在原地。过了不久，上校和奥索打猎归来。这时，店主低声同这位穿孝服的年轻女人说了几句话，然后用手指向德拉雷比亚。女人红了脸，急切地站起来走了几步，又忽然停住，显然很困惑。奥索离她很近，正好奇地看着她。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Nevil had plenty of time to observe her, for the lady in the mezzaro had halted in the street, and was questioning somebody on a subject which, to judge from the expression of her eyes, must have interested her exceedingly.Then, as soon as she received an answer, she touched her mount with her riding-switch, and, breaking into a quick trot, never halted till she reached the door of the hotel in which Sir Thomas Nevil and Orso were staying.There, after exchanging a few words with the host, the girl sprang nimbly from her saddle and seated herself on a stone bench beside the entrance door, while her groom led the horses away to the stable.Miss Lydia, in her Paris gown, passed close beside the stranger, who did not raise her eyes.A quarter of an hour later she opened her window, and saw the lady in the mezzaro still sitting in the same place and in the same attitude.Not long afterward the colonel and Orso returned from hunting.Then the landlord said a few words to the young lady in mourning, and pointed to della Rebbia with his finger.She coloured deeply, rose eagerly, went a few paces forward, and then stopped short, apparently much confused.Orso was quite close to her, and was looking at her curiously.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Good!” said she to herself, “that is primitive!” and she anticipated acquiring many interesting facts by observing this youthful representative of ancient Corsican manners.As for Orso, he was evidently a trifle uneasy, fearing, doubtless, that his sister might say or do something which savoured too much of her native village.But Colomba watched him constantly, and regulated all her own movements by his.Sometimes she looked at him fixedly, with a strange expression of sadness, and then, if Orso’s eyes met hers, he was the first to turn them away, as though he would evade some question which his sister was mentally addressing to him, the sense of which he understood only too well.Everybody talked French, for the colonel could only express himself very badly in Italian.Colomba understood French, and even pronounced the few words she was obliged to exchange with her entertainers tolerably well.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上校坐在他平时坐惯的沙发上，内维尔小姐尝试了几个话题，想叫美丽的科隆巴开口说话，但都失败了。她只好放弃，转而请奥索给她读一首但丁的诗，但丁是她最喜爱的诗人。奥索选了《地狱篇》中描写弗朗切斯卡·达丽米妮的片段，开始尽可能充满感情地朗读起来，美丽的三行诗节把两个年轻人冒险一起读爱情故事的情景描述得惟妙惟肖。他读着的时候，科隆巴靠近了桌子，并抬起先前还低垂的头。她大大的眼睛射出奇异的火光，脸一阵涨红一阵苍白，坐在椅子上激动地颤抖不已。意大利人的生理结构真了不起，不用靠学究来解释诗的美丽，便已全然理解！</td>
		<td class="en">The colonel then resumed his customary position on the sofa, and Miss Nevil, after attempting several subjects of conversation, gave up all hope of inducing the fair Colomba to talk, and begged Orso to read her a canto out of Dante, her favourite poet.Orso chose the canto of the Inferno, containing the episode of Francesca da Rimini, and began to read, as impressively as he was able, the glorious tiercets which so admirably express the risk run by two young persons who venture to read a love-story together.As he read on Colomba drew nearer to the table, and raised her head, which she had kept lowered.Her wide-open eyes, shone with extraordinary fire, she grew red and pale by turns, and stirred convulsively in her chair.How admirable is the Italian organization, which can understand poetry without needing a pedant to explain its beauties!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The family to which Colonel della Rebbia belonged hated several other families, but that of the Barricini particularly.Some people asserted that in the sixteenth century a Della Rebbia had seduced a lady of the Barricini family, and had afterward been poniarded by a relative of the outraged damsel.Others, indeed, told the story in a different fashion, declaring that it was a della Rebbia who had been seduced, and a Barricini who had been poniarded.However that may be, there was, to use the time-honoured expression, “blood between the two houses.”Nevertheless, and contrary to custom, this murder had not resulted in others; for the della Rebbia and the Barricini had been equally persecuted by the Genoese Government, and as the young men had all left the country, the two families were deprived, during several generations, of their more energetic representatives.At the close of the last century, one of the della Rebbias, an officer in the Neapolitan service, quarrelled, in a gambling hell, with some soldiers, who called him a Corsican goatherd, and other insulting names.He drew his sword, but being only one against three, he would have fared very ill if a stranger, who was playing in the same room, had not exclaimed, “I, too, am a Corsican,” and come to his rescue.This stranger was one of the Barricini, who, for that matter, was not acquainted with his countryman.After mutual explanations, they interchanged courtesies and vowed eternal friendship.For on the Continent, quite contrary to their practice in their own island, Corsicans quickly become friends.This fact was clearly exemplified on the present occasion.As long as della Rebbia and Barricini remained in Italy they were close friends.Once they were back in Corsica, they saw each other but very seldom, although they both lived in the same village; and when they died, it was reported that they had not spoken to each other for five or six years.Their sons lived in the same fashion—“on ceremony,” as they say in the island; one of them Ghilfuccio, Orso’s father, was a soldier; the other Giudice Barricini, was a lawyer.Having both become heads of families, and being separated by their professions, they scarcely ever had an opportunity of seeing or hearing of each other.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The village of Pietranera is very irregularly built, like most Corsican villages—for indeed, to see a street, the traveller must betake himself to Cargese, which was built by Monsieur de Marboeuf.The houses, scattered irregularly about, without the least attempt at orderly arrangement, cover the top of a small plateau, or rather of a ridge of the mountain.Toward the centre of the village stands a great evergreen oak, and close beside it may be seen a granite trough, into which the water of a neighbouring spring is conveyed by a wooden pipe.This monument of public utility was constructed at the common expense of the della Rebbia and Barricini families.But the man who imagined this to be a sign of former friendship between the two families would be sorely mistaken.On the contrary, it is the outcome of their mutual jealousy.Once upon a time, Colonel della Rebbia sent a small sum of money to the Municipal Council of his commune to help to provide a fountain.The lawyer Barricini hastened to forward a similar gift, and to this generous strife Pietranera owes its water supply.Round about the evergreen oak and the fountain there is a clear space, known as “the Square,” on which the local idlers gather every night.Sometimes they play at cards, and once a year, in Carnival-time, they dance.At the two ends of the square stands two edifices, of greater height than breadth, built of a mixture of granite and schist.These are the Towers of the two opposing families, the Barricini and the della Rebbia.Their architecture is exactly alike, their height is similar, and it is quite evident that the rivalry of the two families has never been absolutely decided by any stroke of fortune in favor of either.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It may perhaps be well to explain what should be understood by this word, “Tower.”It is a square building, some forty feet in height, which in any other country would be simply described as a pigeon-house.A narrow entrance-door, eight feet above the level of the ground, is reached by a very steep flight of steps.Above the door is a window, in front of which runs a sort of balcony, the floor of which is pierced with openings, like a machicolation, through which the inhabitants may destroy an unwelcome visitor without any danger to themselves.Between the window and the door are two escutcheons, roughly carved.One of these bears what was originally a Genoese cross, now so battered that nobody but an antiquary could recognise it.On the other are chiselled the arms of the family to whom the Tower belongs.If the reader will complete this scheme of decoration by imagining several bullet marks on the escutcheons and on the window frames, he will have a fair idea of a Corsican mansion, dating from the middle ages.I had forgotten to add that the dwelling-house adjoins the tower, and is frequently connected with it by some interior passage.</td></tr>

You villain!I ask you for a hundred francs?I don’t know who you are.’Then he showed me a letter, or rather a dirty rag of paper, whereby he was summoned to deposit a hundred francs on a certain spot, on pain of having his house burned and his cows killed by Giocanto Castriconi—that’s my name.And they had been vile enough to forge my signature!What annoyed me most was that the letter was written in patois, and was full of mistakes in spelling—I who won every prize at the university!I began by giving my rascal a cuff that made him twist round and round.‘Aha! You take me for a thief, blackguard that you are!’I said, and I gave him a hearty kick, you know where.Then feeling rather better, I went on, ‘When are you to take the money to the spot mentioned in the letter?’‘This very day.’‘Very good, then take it there!’It was at the foot of a pine-tree, and the place had been exactly described.He brought the money, buried it at the foot of the tree, and came and joined me.I had hidden myself close by.There I stayed, with my man, for six mortal hours, M. della Rebbia.I’d have staid three days, if it had been necessary.At the end of six hours a Bastiaccio, a vile money-lender, made his appearance.As he bent down to take up the money, I fired, and I had aimed so well that, as he fell, his head dropped upon the coins he was unearthing.‘Now, rascal,’ said I to the peasant, ‘take your money, and never dare to suspect Giocanto Castriconi of a mean trick again!’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">His first impulse had been one of blind fury, and he had told himself that fortune was offering him an excellent opportunity of punishing the coward who had avenged the blow he had received by mutilating a horse.But as he moved onward the thought of his promise to the prefect, and, above all, his fear of missing Miss Nevil’s visit, altered his feelings, and made him almost wish he might not come upon Orlanduccio.Soon, however, the memory of his father, the indignity offered to his own horse, and the threats of the Barricini, stirred his rage afresh, and incited him to seek his foe, and to provoke and force him to a fight.Thus tossed by conflicting feelings, he continued his progress, though now he carefully scrutinized every thicket and hedge, and sometimes even pulled up his horse to listen to the vague sounds to be heard in any open country.Ten minutes after he had left little Chilina (it was then about nine o’clock in the morning) he found himself on the edge of an exceedingly steep declivity.The road, or rather the very slight path, which he was following, ran through a maquis that had been lately burned.The ground was covered with whitish ashes, and here and there some shrubs, and a few big trees, blackened by the flames, and entirely stripped of their leaves, still stood erect—though life had long since departed out of them.The sight of a burned maquis is enough to make a man fancy he has been transported into midwinter in some northern clime, and the contrast between the barrenness of the ground over which the flames have passed, with the luxuriant vegetation round about it, heightens this appearance of sadness and desolation.But at that moment the only thing that struck Orso in this particular landscape was one point—an important one, it is true, in his present circumstances.The bareness of the ground rendered any kind of ambush impossible, and the man who has reason to fear that at any moment he may see a gun-barrel thrust out of a thicket straight at his own chest, looks on a stretch of smooth ground, with nothing on it to intercept his view, as a kind of oasis.After this burned maquis came a number of cultivated fields, inclosed, according to the fashion of that country, with breast-high walls, built of dry stones.The path ran between these fields, producing, from a distance, the effect of a thick wood.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The steepness of the declivity made it necessary for Orso to dismount.He was walking quickly down the hill, which was slippery with ashes (he had thrown the bridle on his horse’s neck), and was hardly five-and-twenty paces from one of these stone fences, when, just in front of him, on the right-hand side of the road, he perceived first of all the barrel of a gun, and then a head, rising over the top of the wall.The gun was levelled, and he recognised Orlanduccio, just ready to fire.Orso swiftly prepared for self-defence, and the two men, taking deliberate aim, stared at each other for several seconds, with that thrill of emotion which the bravest must feel when he knows he must either deal death or endure it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The words were hardly out of his mouth when he saw the flash of Orlanduccio’s gun, and almost at the same instant a second shot rang out on his left from the other side of the path, fired by a man whom he had not noticed, and who was aiming at him from behind another wall.Both bullets struck him.The first, Orlanduccio’s, passed through his left arm, which Orso had turned toward him as he aimed.The second shot struck him in the chest, and tore his coat, but coming in contact with the blade of his dagger, it luckily flattened against it, and only inflicted a trifling bruise.Orso’s left arm fell helpless at his side, and the barrel of his gun dropped for a moment, but he raised it at once, and aiming his weapon with his right hand only, he fired at Orlanduccio.His enemy’s head, which was only exposed to the level of the eyes, disappeared behind the wall.Then Orso, swinging round to the left, fired the second barrel at a man in a cloud of smoke whom he could hardly see.This face likewise disappeared.The four shots had followed each other with incredible swiftness; no trained soldiers ever fired their volleys in quicker succession.After Orso’s last shot a great silence fell.The smoke from his weapon rose slowly up into the sky.There was not a movement, not the slightest sound from behind the wall.But for the pain in his arm, he could have fancied the men on whom he had just fired had been phantoms of his own imagination.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Fully expecting a second volley, Orso moved a few steps, to place himself behind one of the burned trees that still stood upright in the maquis.Thus sheltered, he put his gun between his knees, and hurriedly reloaded it.Meanwhile his left arm began to hurt him horribly, and felt as if it were being dragged down by a huge weight.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">What had become of his adversaries?He could not understand.If they had taken to flight, if they had been wounded, he would certainly have heard some noise, some stir among the leaves.Were they dead, then?Or, what was far more likely, were they not waiting behind their wall for a chance of shooting at him again.In his uncertainty, and feeling his strength fast failing him, he knelt down on his right knee, rested his wounded arm upon the other, and took advantage of a branch that protruded from the trunk of the burned tree to support his gun.With his finger on the trigger, his eye fixed on the wall, and his ear strained to catch the slightest sound, he knelt there, motionless, for several minutes, which seemed to him a century.At last, behind him, in the far distance, he heard a faint shout, and very soon a dog flew like an arrow down the slope, and stopped short, close to him, wagging its tail.It was Brusco, the comrade and follower of the bandits—the herald, doubtless, of his master’s approach.Never was any honest man more impatiently awaited.With his muzzle in the air, and turned toward the nearest fence, the dog sniffed anxiously.Suddenly he gave vent to a low growl, sprang at a bound over the wall, and almost instantly reappeared upon its crest, whence he gazed steadily at Orso with eyes that spoke surprise as clearly as a dog’s may do it.Then he sniffed again, this time toward the other inclosure, the wall of which he also crossed.Within a second he was back on the top of that, with the same air of astonishment and alarm, and straightway he bounded into the thicket with his tail between his legs, still gazing at Orso, and retiring from him slowly, and sideways, until he had put some distance between them.Then off he started again, tearing up the slope almost as fast as he had come down it, to meet a man, who, in spite of its steepness, was rapidly descending.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Meanwhile, very shortly after Orso’s departure, Colomba’s spies had warned her that the Barricini were out on the warpath, and from that moment she was racked by the most intense anxiety.She was to be seen moving hither and thither all over the house, between the kitchen and the rooms that were being made ready for her guests, doing nothing, yet always busy, and constantly stopping to look out of a window for any unusual stir in the village.Toward eleven o’clock, a somewhat numerous cavalcade rode into Pietranera.This was the colonel, with his daughter, their servants, and their guide.Colomba’s first word, as she welcomed them, was “Have you seen my brother?”Then she questioned the guide as to the road they had taken, and the hour of their departure, and having heard his answers, she could not understand why they had not met him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“也许，”向导说，“你哥哥走的是上面的路，而我们走的是下面的路。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Perhaps,” said the guide, “your brother took the higher path; we came by the lower one.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但科隆巴只是摇摇头，又问了很多问题。尽管她生来性格坚毅，可此时越是出于自尊，想在客人面前隐藏自己的软弱，越是没法掩盖她的不安。当她讲述了双方和解未遂的过程以及随之而来的不幸事件之后，她的不安也传染给了上校和莉迪娅小姐。莉迪娅小姐非常不安，想派人四处寻找，她的父亲提议由他立刻骑马带着向导去找奥索。客人们的惊慌提醒了科隆巴作为女主人的责任。她努力让自己笑着，催促上校入席吃饭，用各种各样的理由来解释哥哥迟到的原因，虽然她自己不到片刻就把那些理由一一推翻了。上校觉得自己作为男人，有责任安慰女士们，因此也提出了自己的一番解释。</td>
		<td class="en">But Colomba only shook her head and asked more questions.In spite of her natural firmness of character, increased as it was by her proud desire to conceal any sign of weakness before strangers, she could not hide her anxiety, and as soon as she had informed them of the attempted reconciliation, and of its unfortunate issue, this was shared by the colonel and Miss Lydia.Miss Nevil became very uneasy, and wanted to have messengers sent off in every direction, and her father offered to remount at once and set out with the guide in search of Orso.Her guests’ alarm recalled Colomba to a sense of her duties as a hostess.She strove to force a smile as she pressed the colonel to come to table, and suggested twenty plausible reasons, which she herself demolished within an instant, to account for her brother’s delay.The colonel, feeling it to be his duty, as a man, to reassure the ladies, put forward his own explanation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我敢打赌，”他说，“德拉雷比亚一定是碰到了好猎物，或是别的什么。他忍受不了那个诱惑，我们马上就可以看见他提着重重的猎物袋回来了。“对了，”他又补充说，“我们在路上确实是听见了四声枪响。有两声特别响，我还对女儿说：‘我敢打赌那是德拉雷比亚在打猎。只有我的枪才会发出那么大的响声。’”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll wager,” he said, “that della Rebbia has come across some game or other.He has not been able to stand out against that temptation, and we shall soon see him come in with a heavy bag.‘Pon my soul,” he went on, “we did hear four shots fired on the road.Two of them were louder than the others, and I said to my girl, ‘I’ll bet anything that’s della Rebbia out shooting!My gun is the only one that would make that noise.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >科隆巴脸色变得惨白，在旁边仔细观察着她的莉迪娅显然明白了上校的推测引起了科隆巴什么样的猜疑。沉默了几分钟以后，科隆巴又急切地问道，那两声特别响的枪声是在另外两声之前还是之后。可是上校、他女儿，还有向导都没有注意到这非常重要的一点。</td>
		<td class="en">Colomba turned pale, and Lydia, who was watching her closely, had no difficulty in guessing the suspicions with which the colonel’s conjecture had inspired her.After a few minutes’ silence, Colomba eagerly inquired whether the two louder reports had been heard before or after the others.But neither the colonel, his daughter, nor the guide had paid much attention to this all-important detail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了下午一点钟，科隆巴派出去打探消息的人一个也没回来，她只好鼓起勇气，坚持要客人们和她一起入席吃饭。可是，除了上校，其他人都吃不下去。只要广场上有一丁点儿响动，科隆巴就跑到窗户旁。然后，她又沮丧地回来坐下，更加沮丧地同客人们勉强谈些琐碎的话题。谁也没有注意谈话内容，时不时还会有一段长时间的沉默。突然，他们听见一匹马疾驰而来的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">Toward one o’clock, as none of Colomba’s messengers had yet returned, she gathered all her courage, and insisted that her guests should sit down to table with her.But, except the colonel, none of them could eat.At the slightest sound in the square, Colomba ran to the window.Then drearily she returned to her place, and struggled yet more drearily to carry on a trivial conversation, to which nobody paid the slightest attention, and which was broken by long intervals of silence.All at once they heard a horse’s gallop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊！肯定是哥哥回来了！”科隆巴站起来说。可她却看见基莉娜骑着奥索的马——“我哥哥死了！”她惨叫道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah! That must be my brother at last!” said Colomba, rising from her chair.But when she saw Chilina astride on Orso’s horse—“My brother is dead!” she cried, in a heart-rending voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上校手中的杯子掉了下来。内维尔小姐也尖叫了一声。他们都冲到大门口。基莉娜还没跳下马，早已被科隆巴像抓羽毛一样一把抓起来。她抓得太紧了，小姑娘差点儿喘不过起来。小姑娘看懂了科隆巴痛苦的表情，所以她的第一句话就是《奥塞罗》合唱中的那句话：“他活着！”科隆巴松了手，基莉娜像一只小猫一样敏捷地跳到地上。</td>
		<td class="en">The colonel dropped his glass.Miss Lydia screamed.They all rushed to the door of the house.Before Chilina could jump off her steed, she was snatched up like a feather by Colomba, who held her so tight that she almost choked her.The child understood her agonized look, and her first words were those of the chorus in Othello: “He lives!”Colomba’s grasp relaxed, and nimbly as a kitten Chilina dropped upon the ground.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别的人呢？”科隆巴嘶哑着嗓子问。基莉娜用食指和中指画了一个十字。科隆巴惨白的脸立刻变得通红。她向巴里奇尼家投去凶狠的一瞥，然后微笑着转向客人们。</td>
		<td class="en">“The others?” queried Colomba hoarsely.Chilina crossed herself with her first and middle finger.A deep flush instantly replaced the deadly pallor of Colomba’s face.She cast one fierce look at the Barricini dwelling, and then, with a smile, she turned to her guests.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为强盗们报信的彩虹女神要讲的故事很长。她的土话先由科隆巴直译成意大利语，再由内维尔小姐译成英语，上校边听边骂声不绝，美丽的莉迪娅小姐则叹息不止。只有科隆巴听了无动于衷。不过她把手里的花布餐巾拧来绞去，简直要把它撕成碎片似的。她打断小姑娘的话有五六次之多，总是叫她重复说布朗多拉奇奥认为奥索的伤势没有危险，比这更严重的伤势他见过好多。讲完故事后，基莉娜说奥索急切地需要信纸，还要求他妹妹请求一位可能正呆在自己家中的小姐先不要离开，直到收到他的来信。</td>
		<td class="en">The story the bandit’s Iris had to tell was a long one.Her narrative, translated literally into Italian by Colomba, and then into English by Miss Nevil, wrung more than one oath from the colonel, more than one sigh from the fair Lydia.But Colomba heard it all unmoved.Only she twisted her damask napkin till it seemed as if she must tear it in pieces.She interrupted the child, five or six times over, to make her repeat again that Brandolaccio had said the wound was not dangerous, and that he had seen many worse.When she had finished her tale, Chilina announced that Orso earnestly begged he might be sent writing materials, and that he desired his sister would beseech a lady who might be staying in his house not to depart from it, until she had received a letter from him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这件事是他最担心的，”小姑娘补充说，“我本来已经上了路，他又把我叫回去嘱咐了一番，让我别忘了带这句口信。那已经是第三次嘱咐了。”科隆巴听了哥哥的这道命令，微微一笑，紧紧地握住那位标致的英国姑娘的手。英国姑娘泪流满面，认为故事的这一部分不宜翻译给父亲听。</td>
		<td class="en">“That is what was worrying him most,” the child added; “and even after I had started he called me back, to bid me not forget the message.It was the third time he had given it to me.”When Colomba heard of her brother’s injunction she smiled faintly, and squeezed the fair Englishwoman’s hand.That young lady burst into tears, and did not seem to think it advisable to translate that particular part of the story to her father.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Yes, my dear,” cried Colomba, kissing Miss Nevil.“You shall stay with me, and you shall help us.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，她从衣柜里找出一堆旧亚麻衣物，把它们剪开，用作绒布和绷带。任何人看见她闪闪发光的眼睛、绯红的脸颊和一会儿忧心忡忡、一会儿镇静异常的表情，都很难说清她究竟是为哥哥受伤而发愁多一些，还是为仇人死亡而高兴多一些。一会儿她倒咖啡给上校，告诉上校自己多么会煮咖啡，一会儿又吩咐内维尔小姐和基莉娜缝绷带，并把它们卷起来。然后，她又向基莉娜询问奥索的伤口是否很痛，这差不多是第20遍了。她时不时放下手中的活计，对上校说：</td>
		<td class="en">Then, taking a pile of old linen out of a cupboard, she began to cut it up, to make lint and bandages.Any one who saw her flashing eyes, her heightened colour, her alternate fits of anxiety and composure, would have found it hard to say whether distress at her brother’s wound, or delight at the extinction of her foes, were most affecting her.One moment she was pouring out the colonel’s coffee, and telling him how well she made it, the next she was setting Miss Lydia and Chilina to work, exhorting them to sew bandages, and roll them up.Then, for the twentieth time, she would ask whether Orso’s wound was very painful.She constantly broke off her own work to exclaim to the colonel:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“两个如此狡猾的人，多危险！他只有一个人，还受了伤，只剩下一条胳膊能用！他居然把他们两个都杀了！多么勇敢啊，上校！他还算不上是一个英雄吗？啊，内维尔小姐！能够生活在你们那样的太平地方，该多幸福啊！我敢肯定你还没有真正认识我的哥哥，直到现在！我早说过——‘雄鹰总要展开双翅！’你被他温和的外貌欺骗了！只有在你身边的时候他才这样，内维尔小姐——啊！要是他能看见你为他准备绷带该多好！我可怜的奥索！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Two such cunning men, such dangerous fellows!And he alone, wounded, with only one arm!He killed the two of them!What courage, colonel!Isn’t he a hero?Ah, Miss Nevil!How good it is to live in a peaceful country like yours!I’m sure you did not really know my brother till now!I said it—‘The falcon will spread his wings!’You were deceived by his gentle look!That’s because with you, Miss Nevil—Ah!

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >莉迪娅小姐完全没心思干活，也说不出话来。她的父亲一直问为什么没人去向地方法官报案。他提起了英国的验尸官调查，还有其他各种各样科西嘉人从没听说过的程序。最后他想知道，这位救助了受伤的奥索的布朗多拉奇奥先生，他的乡间别墅是否离皮埃特拉非常远，他能不能亲自到那里去看他的朋友。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Lydia was doing hardly any work, and could not find a single word to say.Her father kept asking why nobody went to lay a complaint before a magistrate.He talked about a coroner’s inquest, and all sorts of other proceedings quite unknown to Corsican economy.And then he begged to be told whether the country house owned by that worthy Signor Brandolaccio, who had brought succour to the wounded man, was very far away from Pietranera, and whether he could not go there himself, to see his friend.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >科隆巴以惯有的冷静态度回答说，奥索现在在丛林里，有个强盗照顾他，在不知道省长和法官们的态度之前，他要是露面会有很大的风险。最后，她说她会请一位医术高超的外科医生秘密去给奥索治疗。</td>
		<td class="en">And Colomba replied, with her usual composure, that Orso was in the maquis; that he was being taken care of by a bandit; that it would be a great risk for him to show himself until he was sure of the line the prefect and the judges were likely to take; and, finally, that she would manage to have him secretly attended by a skilful surgeon.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The day was far advanced, when a gloomy procession wended its way into the village.The bodies of his two sons were brought home to Lawyer Barricini, each corpse thrown across a mule, which was led by a peasant.A crowd of dependents and idlers followed the dreary cortege.With it appeared the gendarmes, who always came in too late, and the deputy-mayor, throwing up his hands, and incessantly repeating, “What will Signor Prefetto say!”Some of the women, among them Orlanduccio’s foster-mother, were tearing their hair and shrieking wildly.But their clamorous grief was less impressive than the dumb despair of one man, on whom all eyes were fixed.This was the wretched father, who passed from one corpse to the other, lifting up the earth-soiled heads, kissing the blackened lips, supporting the limbs that were stiff already, as if he would save them from the jolting of the road.Now and then he opened his mouth as though about to speak, but not a cry came, not a word.His eyes never left the dead bodies, and as he walked, he knocked himself against the stones, against the trees, against every obstacle that chanced to lie in his path.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们就这样边谈着边走到了农舍，在那里他们找到了酒、草莓和奶油。科隆巴帮助农妇摘草莓，上校自顾自地在那里喝酒。在一条小径转弯的地方，科隆巴看见一个老头坐在一张草垫椅子上面晒太阳。看样子他是生病了，脸颊深陷，眼睛凹进去，瘦得吓人。他坐在那里，一动不动，面无血色、目光呆滞地望着前方，看上去不像个活人，倒像一具僵尸。科隆巴充满好奇地凝视了他几分钟，这吸引了农妇的注意。</td>
		<td class="en">Chatting thus, they reached the farm-house, where they found wine, strawberries, and cream.Colomba helped the farmer’s wife to gather the strawberries, while the colonel drank his aleatico.At the turning of a path she caught sight of an old man, sitting in the sun, on a straw chair.He seemed ill, his cheeks were fallen in, his eyes were hollow, he was frightfully thin; as he sat there, motionless, pallid, staring fixedly in front of him, he looked more like a corpse than like a living creature.Colomba watched him for some minutes, and with a curiosity so great that it attracted the woman’s attention.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这位可怜的老人是你的同乡，”她说，“因为我从你说话的口音听出你是科西嘉人，小姐！他在家乡遭到了不幸。他的儿子们都死于非命。他们说——请你原谅，小姐——贵乡人要是相互吵架了，对彼此都心狠手辣。所以这位老先生只剩下孤零零一个人，便到比萨来投靠一位远亲，这位远亲就是这个农庄的主人。因为遭受了大难，又过度伤心，这位好人神经有点儿不大正常……我家太太嫌他碍手碍脚——因为她要接待很多客人。于是她便把他安顿在这里。他性情温和——不妨碍人。他一整天也说不了三句话。事实上，他脑子已经不太清醒了。每星期大夫都来给他治病。大夫说他活不长了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That poor old fellow is a countryman of yours,” she said.“For I know you are from Corsica by the way you talk, signorina!He has had great trouble in his own country.His children met with some terrible death.They say—you’ll excuse me, signorina—that when they quarrel, your compatriots don’t show each other very much mercy.Then the poor old gentleman, being left all alone, came over to Pisa, to a distant relation of his, who owns this farm.Between his misfortunes and his sorrow, the good man is a little cracked....The lady found him troublesome—for she sees a great deal of company.So she sent him out here.He’s very gentle—no worry at all.He doesn’t speak three words the whole day long.In fact, his brain’s quite gone.The doctor comes to see him every week.He says he won’t live long.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那他是没希望了？”科隆巴说，“他这种情况，死了倒是福气。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s no hope for him, then!” said Colomba.“In such a case, death will be a mercy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“小姐，你应该同他讲讲科西嘉话。也许听到乡音，他的心情便会好些。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You might say a word to him in Corsican, signorina.Perhaps it would cheer him up to hear the speech of his own country.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我来瞧瞧!”科隆巴说，脸上露出一丝神秘的微笑。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll see!” said Colomba, and her smile was mysterious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她走近老头，直到她的影子落在他的椅子上。于是那可怜的白痴抬起头，盯着科隆巴，科隆巴也看着他，脸上始终挂着微笑。片刻之后，老头用手抹了抹前额，闭上眼睛，仿佛不愿看到科隆巴似的。紧接着，他又睁开眼睛，这次睁得非常大。他动了动嘴唇，想伸出手来，可又被科隆巴的目光震慑住了，像钉在椅子上似的，既不能说话，又不能动弹。最后，大滴泪水从他的眼中涌出，起伏的胸膛深处也发出几声呜咽。</td>
		<td class="en">She drew nearer to the old man, till her shadow fell across his chair.Then the poor idiot lifted his head and stared at Colomba, while she looked at him, smiling still.After a moment, the old man passed his hand across his forehead, and closed his eyes, as though he would have shut out the sight of Colomba.He opened them again, desperately wide this time.His lips began to work, he tried to stretch out his hands, but, fascinated by Colomba’s glance, he sat, nailed, as it were, to his chair, unable to move or utter a word.At last great tears dropped from his eyes, and a few sobs escaped from his heaving chest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这还是我第一次看见他这个样子，”好心的妇人说，“这位小姐跟你是同乡，她来看你来了。”她对老人说。</td>

		<td class="en">“Mercy!” he cried in a hoarse voice.“Mercy!Are you not content?The leaf I burned.How did you read it?But why did you take them both?Orlanduccio!You can’t have read anything against him!You should have left me one, only one!Orlanduccio—you didn’t read his name!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就是要他们俩的性命，”科隆巴用科西嘉土话低声对他说，“树枝砍下来了！要不是树根腐烂了，我也要把它连根拔起呢！算了吧！不要抱怨了。你受苦的日子不长了！我可是足足苦了两年！”</td>
		<td class="en">“I had to have them both!” answered Colomba, speaking low and in the Corsican dialect.“The branches are topped off!If the stem had not been rotten, I would have torn it up!Come!Make no moan.You will not suffer long!I suffered for two years!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老头大叫了一声，接着脑袋低垂到胸前。科隆巴背转身，慢慢地向屋子里走去，嘴里哼着一段哭丧歌，尽管那歌词现在已经没有意义了：</td>
