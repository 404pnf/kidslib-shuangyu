		<td class="en">“Done!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们握了握手，周围的朋友们蜂拥过来，有人提出建议，有人挖苦嘲弄。这便为我与“帅气的船舱侍者”之间令我终身难忘的风流韵事播下了种子。</td>
		<td class="en">We shook hands, and the fellows crowded round with all sorts of advice and persiflage.Thus was the seed sown, out of which was to spring the never-to-be-forgotten romance of “The Handsome Cabin Boy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两周后，我孤孤单单地登上了我的“鹰隼号”帆船，开始了驶往火奴鲁鲁的短程航行。刚把法拉隆灯放下，我就起了疑心。从厨师到航海官，每个人都在抱怨那个新来的船舱侍者。他们认为他非常用心，但是很无能。在这个紧要关头，比利老兄却弃我们于不顾，而这些事情我都是委托我的代理人处理的，但他却非常草率地雇佣了那个侍者。</td>
		<td class="en">The succeeding fortnight found me in solitary grandeur aboard my schooner yacht Falcon, bound for a short cruise to Honolulu.We had hardly sunk the Farralone Light, when my suspicions were aroused.From the cook to the sailing-master complaints began to pour in about the new cabin boy.They held he was willing enough, but worthless.At the last moment, Billy, the old boy, had left us in the lurch, and my agent, to whom all such matters were entrusted, had hastily procured the present incumbent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正如他们所说的那样，他很用心，但是——简单地说，他对自己的职责一无所知，完全无法胜任那份工作。但是，由于他是那么地努力，每个人都被他吸引住了。而且他又是一个如此帅气的小伙子。乌黑的眼睛，红润的面颊，浅橄榄色皮肤，再加上优雅的鹅蛋脸——他使我想起与杰克·哈利迪打的赌也就不足为奇了。而且，尽管他看上去是一个十五六岁的瘦弱少年，他的身材却隐隐地有些丰满，这一切更加证实了我的怀疑。</td>
		<td class="en">As they said, he was willing enough, but—in short, he was ignorant of his duties and totally unfit for such a position.Yet he tried so hard that everybody was drawn toward him.And he was such a handsome lad.Dark-eyed, rosy-cheeked, with a delicate olive complexion and an exquisite oval—small wonder that he recalled to my mind the bet with Jack Haliday.And then, for the slender lad of fifteen or sixteen that he appeared, there was a vague, insinuating fullness about the figure, which did not fail to corroborate my suspicions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但我始终保持沉默，静候着确认的时机。没想到，机会很快就来了。一天中午，我和航海官正在船尾用六分仪专心地测量着太阳高度。那个少年端着一盘煤灰，从舱梯那里上来，他刚刚打扫完船舱里的炉子。他没有到避风的地方去，而是走到迎风的横杆那里将那些灰烬倾洒了出去。那些灰烬确实飘起来了——可自然是向后飘的，落了我们一身。</td>
		<td class="en">But I held my hush and awaited confirmation.This came sooner than I expected.The sailing-master and myself were on the poop, one noon, with our sextants, bent on shooting the sun.The lad came up the companionway with a pan of soot and ashes; he had just cleaned the cabin stove.Instead of going to the lee, he stepped to the weather rail and let fly the refuse.And fly it did—backwards, of course, and all over us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >航海官揉了揉落进眼睛里的一大把灰尘，一把抓住了这个小坏蛋的胳膊。纳尔逊是个在海上长大的粗犷汉子，他那口流利的方言，只有和他一样长时间在海上生活的人才能听得懂。他一边上上下下地晃着他，一边混杂着英语和斯堪的纳维亚语的话狠狠地咒骂他。这些咒骂是那么有力，我八辈子也没听过。</td>
		<td class="en">Digging a handful out of his eyes, the sailing-master grabbed the young rascal by the arm.Now Nelson was a rough son of the sea, and had a mellifluous command of the vernacular which serves for emphasis to those who sail the same.He shook him up and down and cursed him with as virile a combination of English and Scandinavian oaths as was ever my luck to hear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那少年像失了魂似的哭了起来。他捡起盘子，向船舱走去，但走到我面前时，却突然趔趄了一下，跌倒了。在他摔倒之前我接住了他，然而——我的胳膊不巧地碰了不该碰的地方很多下，这次准错不了了。</td>
		<td class="en">The boy lost his wits and began to cry.Picking up the pan, he started for the cabin, but just opposite me, reeled and toppled over.I caught him before he could fall, and—well, my arm had strayed in forbidden pastures too often to be mistaken now.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎呀，你是个女孩！”我喊道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, you’re a girl!” I cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >掌舵员已经开始窃笑，我急忙把她带到舱底，使她免于在别的男人面前遭遇尴尬。她哭个不停，我费劲心机地安慰她，直到筋疲力尽。终于，她平静下来了。</td>
		<td class="en">The man at the wheel began to snicker, so I hurried her below to save her from confusion before the men.There she cried, and sobbed, and carried on, till I was almost as distracted myself, in my efforts to soothe her.At last she calmed down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，先生。”她开口说道，“我希望你不会生我的气。我——他——那位先生。”</td>
		<td class="en">“O, sir,” she began, “I hope you won’t be angry with me.I—he—Mr.—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是杰克·哈利迪让你这么做的，对不对？”我插话道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s Jack Haliday’s doing, isn’t it?” I interrupted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，先生。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, sir.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么你肯定知道我们打赌的事情，那到时就要请你替我作证，我发现了你的——呃——身份。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then you know all about the bet, and you’ll have to testify that I discovered your—er—identity.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我会的，先生。我搞砸了，他会生气的。呜——呜——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, sir, and he’ll be angry because I lost.Boo—hoo—oo—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，你表现得挺好的。”我觉得她需要点鼓励，“厨师永远都不会发现的——你看，到底是怎么——你得改变你的——”</td>
		<td class="en">“O, you did very well.” I thought she needed a little cheering.“The cook would never have discovered—say! how the deuce—you’ll have to change your—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >实际上，我们两个都有些尴尬。那个冒失的厨师竟一直没有发现！我把他叫到船舱里来。</td>
		<td class="en">It was indeed embarrassing for both of us.And that blundering cook had never tumbled!I called him into the cabin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让那个德国来的甲板水手来帮你吧。”我吩咐道，“再去你的房间把——呃——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tell off that German deck boy to help you,” I ordered.“And go to your room and pack up Miss—er—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“伊——伊——伊斯门。”地上那个忧郁的姑娘哽咽着说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“E—E—Eastman,” sobbed the disconsolate bundle on the floor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再把伊斯门小姐的东西整理一下，送到空闲的特等客舱里，把客舱里收拾得舒适些。我会额外付你薪水的。快去！别整天站在那里！”看到他惊奇地睁圆了眼睛，我忍不住笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">“And pack up Miss Eastman’s belongings. Take them to the spare state-room, and make everything comfortable.I’ll see you get extra pay for this trip.Go!Don’t stand there all day!”I could not help laughing at his round-eyed wonder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我拖着她整洁的储物箱先进了她的新住处，她紧跟着进来的时候，我说：“我不知道该怎么为你找到合适的衣服。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t know what to do in the way of suitable clothes,” I said, as she entered her new berth in the wake of a trim little sea-chest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没关系的，先生。”她啜泣着说道，“我带——带了一些裙子过来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s all right, sir,” she replied, between her sobs.“I b—brought some dresses along.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我真是该死！”门关上后，厨师喊道，“哦，先生，请您再说一遍，您是说，先生，那孩子是——是个女孩？想想吧！——我可是个结了婚的男人！我妻子会怎么想啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Strike me blind!” cried the cook, as the door shut.“O, I beg your pardon, sir; but do you mean to tell me, sir, that he’s a—a she?Think of it!—and me a married man!What’ll my wife say?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管我试着跟他说没必要让他妻子知道这件事情，他却依旧更加懊恼地走回了厨房，甚至比那个造成他困扰的小可怜更加苦恼。但是，我可以理解他的感受，我何尝不是处于同样尴尬的境地，水手们肯定会把这件事情当做笑话传开的。</td>
		<td class="en">Though I tried to explain that there was no necessity of his wife knowing, he wandered away to the galley, more woe-begone, if anything, than the poor creature who had caused his distress.Still, I could sympathize with him, realizing as I did, my own false position, and knowing how the sailors must be haw-hawing among themselves.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚饭送到了她的房间里，直到第二天早上她才露面。她是一位娴静的少女，虽然头发很短。为了这么个无聊的赌注，就把她的长发剪掉了，真是可惜。</td>
		<td class="en">Dinner was sent into her, and it was not till next morning that she showed herself.And then it was a demure little maid, for all her short brown locks.It seemed a pity they had been clipped for the sake of a paltry bet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的家人会怎么说呢？”我问她，并接着解释道,“他们知道这件事情吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What will your people say?” I asked, in the course of explanations.“Do they know?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我哥哥知道这件事情。在他的同意下我才过来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My brother does.I came with his consent.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你哥哥简直就是个无赖，应该用马鞭好好打他一顿。至少可以说，这是非常可耻的行为。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Your brother’s a scoundrel and ought to be horse-whipped.It’s disgraceful, to say the least.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么可耻？”</td>
		<td class="en">“How?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这真是个难题啊。为什么可耻？我开始意识到杰克·哈利迪给我造成的麻烦有多棘手了。为什么可耻？多么纯真啊！</td>
		<td class="en">This was a poser.How?I began to comprehend the mess Jack Haliday had got me into.How?What innocence!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你一定是在女修道院长大的。”我坦率地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“You must have been brought up in a convent,” I said bluntly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，先生。直到一年前，我一直都去圣心修道院。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, sir; I went to the Sacred Heart until a year ago.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >情况越来越糟糕了——落在我身上的责任可真是不轻啊。我终于从她那里探出了事情的缘由。还在孩童时代时，她就失去了母亲。她的父亲是个小商人，将她送到圣心修道院去接受教育。她父亲的境况每况愈下，他过世后，几乎没留下一分钱，撇下一双儿女相依为命。简短地说，后来哈利迪就成了他们的保护人。她在表演方面很有天赋，哈利迪就一直鼓励她，还预言说，总有一天大都市的舞台会张开双臂欢迎她这样一位出众的演员的。</td>
		<td class="en">Worse and worse—it was no light responsibility thus thrust upon me.I finally wormed her story from her.She had lost her mother during her childhood, and her father, a small tradesman, had educated her at the Convent of the Sacred Heart.Things had gone from bad to worse with him, and when he died, she and her brother were left penniless.To curtail the story: they had become protégés of Haliday’s.She had shown an aptitude for the stage, and Haliday encouraged her, prophesying that some day the metropolitan vaudeville would open its arms to a soubrette of no mean ability.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“所以当他请我帮他这个忙的时候，”她最后说，“我还能怎么办呢？在他为了我做了这么多以后，我难道还能拒绝他吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And when he asked this favor of me,” she concluded, “what could I do?Refuse, after all he had done for me?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从此之后，游艇呈现出了崭新的面貌。这样一个稚气未脱的孩子，这么一个十六岁的小姑娘，竟然能给生活增添这么多色彩，真是不可思议啊。她成为了全体船员的偶像，就连纳尔逊都道歉了——我打赌这是这个倔家伙生平第一次向别人道歉。她钢琴弹得相当好，尽管嗓音不够有力,音域也不够宽，但她的歌声非常甜美。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, the yacht took on new life.Strange how this chit of a child, this girl of sixteen, brightened things up!She became the idol of all hands and even Nelson apologized—first time the stubborn dog ever did such a thing, I’ll wager.She could play the piano fairly well, and though her voice was not strong and had no register, her singing was sweet indeed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到达火奴鲁鲁后，我准备派人驾船把她送回去，但这个无邪的小家伙却始终不愿接受。当我坚持的时候，她看起来是那么地痛苦，我也只好作罢。此外，没人认识我们。还有她——唉，她完全不知道邪恶为何物，使她醒悟过来简直是个超过我能力范围的任务。我给了她一些钱，很快她就有了一堆衣服和女孩子们钟爱的其他小饰品。之后，我们听了夏威夷乐队举办的音乐会，在乡村开车兜风，还游览了很多风景名胜和好玩的地方。我们度过了一段非常愉快的时光，但是再美好的事情也有结束的那一刻。一个月后，我们就离开了金门大桥。明天，我们就将抵达旧金山。</td>
		<td class="en">When we arrived at Honolulu, I was for making arrangements to send her back by steamer; but the guiless creature would not hear of it, and looked so miserable when I insisted, that I gave in.Besides, nobody knew us.And she—why, she had no conception of evil, and to undeceive her was a task beyond my power.I supplied her with funds, and she soon had a stunning array of gowns and other female fripperies.Then we took in the concerts of the Hawaiian Band, made long drives into the country, and visited many places of interest and recreation.We had a delightful time; but the best of good things must end, and a month later found us off the Golden Gate.To-morrow we should be in San-Francisco.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >次日——点烟的时候，我叹了口气，目光落在她房间的门上。她梦到了什么？我好奇起来。然后，我想到了我那一次次漫长又孤独的航行。而这一次的航行是多么美妙啊！生命开始出现了新的可能。我逐渐意识到生命中还有一些我未曾领略过的魅力——那些我能言善道的朋友们从未停止讨论的魅力。她带来了多么大的转变啊！在船梯上轻巧地移动的脚踝，在甲板上闪闪发亮的鞋子，一个女孩的浅笑声，黄昏时刻的歌声——简而言之，一个女人带来的不可言喻的美好。我被这个想法吓了一跳。让我想想：她今年十六岁，我二十六岁了；等她十九岁的时候，我已经二十九岁了；不，那太漫长了，等她十八岁我二十八岁的时候，嗯，就是这个。毕竟差距也不算太大。再等两年而已！这两年能做得太多了！可以培养感情，而且她的思想和身体都会变得成熟，是啊，只是想想就已经让人充满希望了。还有两年的时间，然后——</td>
		<td class="en">To-morrow—I half sighed as I lighted a cigar, and glanced at her state-room door.What were her dreams, I wondered.Then I thought of my long, lonely cruises.How bright this one had been!Life took on new possibilities, as I began to realize some of its hitherto unknown charms—charms which my benedict friends never ceased to dwell upon.How she had changed things!A neatly turned ankle on the cabin stairs, a twinkling slipper along the deck, a girl’s light laughter, a song at twilight, a—in short, the ineffable something of a woman’s presence.I was startled at the thought.Let me see: sixteen—twenty-six; nineteen—twenty-nine; no, that would be too long to wait, eighteen—twenty-eight—that’s it.And not such a disparity after all.Two years!What would not two years do?Development, the rounding of that mind—aye, and that form, already so rich of promise.Two years, and then—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“八点了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Eight bells!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >腕表的报时声搅乱了我脑海中的美妙画面，我扔掉雪茄睡觉去了。</td>
		<td class="en">The clamor of changing watch had destroyed the fairy pictures; so I tossed away my cigar and went to bed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >杰克·哈利迪和其他所有人都聚在码头处的会所那里等着我们。显然商船换航处的瞭望台前一天晚上就把我们驶离港口的消息通过电报发出去了。他们全都围上了船，我为伊斯门小姐担心。但是，克拉拉——我已经习惯这么叫她了，却勇敢地面对着这场考验。周围人压抑着的期待和强忍着的笑声让我很生气。杰克·哈利迪立刻就开始了舞会。</td>
		<td class="en">Jack Haliday and the whole crowd were at the club-house pier to meet us.Evidently, the lookout of the Merchants’ Exchange had telegraphed our arrival off the Heads the previous night.They trooped aboard in a body, and I trembled for Miss Eastman.However, Clara, as I had come to call her, faced the ordeal bravely.The subdued expectancy and smothered giggles angered me.Jack Haliday opened the ball at once.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘿，你知道的，关于这次晚宴——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I say, you know, about that supper—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“晚宴怎么样了？”我厉声问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What about it?” I asked sharply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我把一切都安排好了，但我觉得最好还是交给你看看。要知道，或许你能提供些建议。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I’ve made all the plans, but I thought it better to submit them to you.You might make a few suggestions, you know.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你把一切都计划好了！”我喊道，“我觉得晚宴的菜单该由我来定啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ve made all the plans!” I shouted.“I have an idea that the ordering of this supper belongs to me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈！哈！哈！”大家都笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ha! ha! ha!” Everybody began to laugh.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“希望你的旅行愉快，伊斯门小姐。”他转过身问她道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hope you had a pleasant trip, Miss Eastman,” he said, turning to her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，非常愉快。”她说道，但我注意到她的双唇在颤抖。</td>
		<td class="en">“O, I did,” she assured him, though I could see her lips were trembling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是怎么发现的？”他问我道。</td>
		<td class="en">“How did you discover it?” he asked, addressing me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“因为她在我的怀里晕倒了，并且——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why she fainted in my arms, and—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈！哈！呵！呵！呵！”人们哄堂大笑起来。面对着落败的对手，我也得意洋洋地笑了。</td>
		<td class="en">“ho! ho!He! he! he!” the crowd fairly roared, and I beamed triumphantly on my discomfited opponent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他生气了吗？”哈利迪泰然自若地继续问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Was he angry?” continued the imperturbable Haliday.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有，”克拉拉答道，“他人很好。当我们抵达火奴鲁鲁的时候，他想用汽船送我回来，但我没让他那么做。后来，我们玩得非常开心。他给我买了糖果和手套，带我坐马车去兜风，还——”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” Clara replied, “he was real nice.And when we got to Honolulu he wanted to send me home on the steamer, but I wouldn’t let him.Then we had a gorgeous time—bought me candy and gloves, took me buggy riding, and—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到这儿，人们都笑疯了。他们拍着杰克的肩膀，用肘戳着他，还欣喜若狂地相互拥抱。</td>
		<td class="en">With this the crowd went mad.They slapped Jack on the shoulder, poked him in the ribs, and hugged each other in ecstasies of glee.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎呀，你这个傻瓜！”杰克喊道，“他就是我的小兄弟鲍勃啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, you ninny!” Jack cried.“That’s my brother Bob.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不可能的。”我反驳道，“哎呀，当她晕倒在我怀里的时候，我——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Impossible,” I rejoined.“Why, when she fainted in my arms, I—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，端庄的伊斯门小姐做了几个后空翻，然后笑盈盈地走向我；她将手伸进她少女的怀里，拿出——天哪！——一对充气垫，就是足球运动员们用的那种。看到这一切，我惊讶得一句话都说不出来。</td>
		<td class="en">At this juncture speech failed me, for the modest Miss Eastman turned a couple of back-flips, came up smiling, thrust a hand into her maidenly bosom and drew forth—heavens!—a couple of pneumatic cushions, the kind used by football players.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于我是怎么把众人领入会所的，鲍勃·哈利迪坐上座的晚宴是怎么进行的，直到今天，仅仅听到“帅气的船舱侍者”就会勾起我满腔的怒火——相信这些事我已无需赘言了。</td>
		<td class="en">It were needless for me to tell how I led the stampede to the club-house; how the supper came off, with Bob Haliday at the head of the table; or how, to this day, the mere mention of “The Handsome Cabin Boy” arouses a certain choler which I can never hope to overcome.</td></tr>
