		<td class="en">客厅的布置十分平常，唯一能吸引当地陌生来客眼球的大概就是墙边“食柜”上摆着的一样东西了。那是一个葡萄干大蛋糕，像奇珍异宝似的被玻璃罩保护着。玻璃罩是博物馆里常见的那种，呈方形，背面是木质的，一般用来装有珍稀羽毛或毛皮的动物标本。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">塞利娜习惯了每天在这个蛋糕跟前停一会儿，回想那突如其来的不幸，也就是井边提水的村民们所说的那件事。这个习惯一直持续到前不久。那件事发生后，她的人生便被蒙上了阴影。那天早上，突然传来消息说骑兵团即将奉令开拔，离开的日子就在两天后。当时，他们第二次结婚公告已经通过，却等不到第三次了，于是匆忙征求意见该怎么办。最后，大家认为在如此忙乱的情形下举行结婚仪式是不明智的，况且仪式来不来得及办还很难说。</td></tr>
