		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我们还是孩子的时候，父亲经常上夜班。一到了春天，他经常在我们刚起床，还穿着睡衣在楼下的时候回来，全身黑不溜秋，疲惫不堪。黑夜同清晨直面相对，而这种接触并不总是愉快的。或许，对拖着又脏又累的身子回家的父亲来说，看到我们欢快地开始新的一天，他心里会很难受。他不喜欢在春天清晨的灿烂阳光中睡去。</td>
		<td class="en">When we were children our father often worked on the night-shift.Once it was spring-time, and he used to arrive home, black and tired, just as we were downstairs in our night-dresses.Then night met morning face to face, and the contact was not always happy.Perhaps it was painful to my father to see us gaily entering upon the day into which he dragged himself soiled and weary.He didn’t like going to bed in the spring morning sunshine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，有时候他心情会很好，因为他会在拂晓时分穿过一片长长的凝满露水的田野。通宵的井下工作后，他喜欢这空旷的清晨，喜欢这露水的晶莹透亮，喜欢这田野的无边无际。他注视每一只小鸟、草丛里的每一丝颤动，他回应凤头麦鸡的嘶叫，模仿鹪鹩的啁啾声。要是可以的话，他希望自己也能用大自然的语言叽嘶、啼叫、啭鸣，而不是用人类的语言。他最喜欢花虫鸟兽了。</td>
		<td class="en">But sometimes he was happy, because of his long walk through the dewy fields in the first daybreak.He loved the open morning, the crystal and the space, after a night down pit.He watched every bird, every stir in the trembling grass, answered the whinnying of the peewits and tweeted to the wrens.If he could, he also would have whinnied and tweeted and whistled, in a native language that was not human.He liked non-human things best.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天早晨，阳光明媚，我们坐在餐桌旁，听见他拖拽着沉重的步子上楼，走了进来。我们开始焦虑不安起来。他的出现总是令人不安，让人觉得拘束。他全身黑黢黢地从窗口走过，我们听到他走进洗涤室，放下锡瓶。但他径直来到了厨房。我们一下就感觉到他有什么事要说。没人吭声。大家盯着他那张黑黝黝的脸看了一会儿。</td>
		<td class="en">One sunny morning we were all sitting at table when we heard his heavy slurring walk up the entry.We became uneasy.His was always a disturbing presence, trammeling.He passed the window darkly, and we heard him go into the scullery and put down his tin bottle.But directly he came into the kitchen.We felt at once that he had something to communicate.No one spoke.We watched his black face for a second.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它们可不是都那么娇弱。”父亲不耐烦地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“They dunna always pine,” replied my father testily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，母亲的话使他想起了他曾经带回来的那些小小的野生动物；它们整天闷闷不乐，不愿再活下去，害得我们大哭一场，痛苦烦恼，全家都精神恍惚。</td>
		<td class="en">But my mother reminded him of other little wild animals he had brought, which had sulked and refused to live, and brought storms of tears and trouble in our house of lunatics.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >麻烦事又来了。小兔子坐在我们的腿上，一动不动，眼睛张得大大的却暗淡无光。我们给它拿来了牛奶，是热牛奶，放在它鼻子跟前。它坐在那纹丝不动，好像躲在远处一个隐蔽的深洞穴里，完全没注意到牛奶。我们滴了几滴牛奶，沾湿了它的嘴和毛须。它一点动静也没有，甚至连沾到的牛奶滴也不甩掉。有人便开始偷偷流泪了。</td>
		<td class="en">Trouble fell on us.The little rabbit sat on our lap, unmoving, its eye wide and dark.We brought it milk, warm milk, and held it to its nose.It sat as still as if it was far away, retreated down some deep burrow, hidden, oblivious.We wetted its mouth and whiskers with drops of milk.It gave no sign, did not even shake off the wet white drops.Somebody began to shed a few secret tears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我刚才怎么说的？”母亲喊道。“把它拿走放回田野去。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What did I say?” cried my mother.“Take it and put it down the field.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的命令没人听。这时，我们都被逼着穿好衣服上学去。小兔子仍然坐在那里。就像一小片朦胧的云。看着它，我们难过极了。可是，再怎么喜爱它，再怎么怜悯它都无济于事。这小东西的感情都埋藏起来了。它们肯定是被压抑着。爱和情感对它来说都是一种侵犯。当我们怀着一腔爱意靠近它时，这只小野兔仍把自己封闭起来，而且变得越发沉默，越发压抑。我们不应该去疼爱它。为了它能自己活下去，我们必须避开它。</td>
		<td class="en">Her command was in vain.We were driven to get dressed for school.There sat the rabbit.It was like a tiny obscure cloud.Watching it, the emotions died out of our breast.Useless to love it, to yearn over it.Its little feelings were all ambushed.They must be circumvented.Love and affection were a trespass upon it.A little wild thing, it became more mute and asphyxiated still in its own arrest, when we approached with love.We must not love it.We must circumvent it, for its own existence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，我对妹妹和母亲下达了命令。不准对小兔子说话，看它一眼也不行。我用一片法兰绒布把它包起来，放在冰冷的客厅一个昏暗的角落里，还在它鼻子前放了一小碟牛奶。在我们上学的时候，母亲是不准进入客厅的。</td>
		<td class="en">So I passed the order to my sister and my mother.The rabbit was not to be spoken to, nor even looked at.Wrapping it in a piece of flannel, I put it in an obscure corner of the cold parlour, and put a saucer of milk before its nose.My mother was forbidden to enter the parlour whilst we were at school.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好像我非得注意你们的废话似的。”母亲受到了侮辱，喊道。但是，我怀疑她是否会冒险到客厅去。</td>
		<td class="en">“As if I should take any notice of your nonsense,” she cried, affronted.Yet I doubt if she ventured into that parlour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >中午放学回来时，我们悄悄溜进客厅，看到小兔子仍然一动不动地坐在绒布里。这奇异的灰棕色小生命竟还活着！对我们来说，这是个令人头痛的问题。</td>
		<td class="en">At midday, after school, creeping into the front room, there we saw the rabbit still and unmoving in the piece of flannel.Strange grey-brown neutralization of life, still living!It was a sore problem to us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么它不喝牛奶呀，妈妈？”我们低声问道。父亲正在睡觉。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why won’t it drink its milk, mother?” we whispered.Our father was asleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个小傻瓜宁愿闷闷不乐地死去。”这可是个大问题。宁愿闷闷不乐地死去！我们放了几片蒲公英的嫩叶在它鼻子前。这个让人猜不透的小东西还是一副漠然的样子。但是它的眼睛发亮了。</td>
		<td class="en">“It prefers to sulk its life away, silly little thing.”A profound problem.Prefers to sulk its life away!We put young dandelion leaves to its nose.The sphinx was not more oblivious.Yet its eye was bright.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，到了喝下午茶的时候，它跳了几英尺，到了那块绒布的外面，坐在那里，好似一小朵无声无息的浓密棕色云彩，小胡子也一动不动。只有身体一侧微微颤动着，露出点生命的气息。</td>
		<td class="en">At tea-time, however, it had hopped a few inches, out of its flannel, and there it sat again, uncovered, a little solid cloud of muteness, brown, with unmoving whiskers.Only its side palpitated slightly with life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天黑了，父亲出门上班了。小兔子仍然一动也不动。妹妹们绝望了，话都不多，上床前好像都要痛哭一场的样子。母亲越来越生气了，嘴里唠叨着父亲的轻率随性。</td>
		<td class="en">Darkness came, my father set off to work.The rabbit was still unmoving.Dumb despair was coming over the sisters, a threat of tears before bedtime.Clouds of my mother’s anger gathered, as she muttered against my father’s wantonness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们又将小兔子用父亲的旧矿工背心包起来。不过现在我们把它放到洗涤间的铜壁炉下面，这样这个小东西或许会以为自己在洞里。我们在地上散放了四、五个碟子，这样要是这个小东西碰巧跳出来也有东西吃。我们让母亲把需要的东西从洗涤间里拿出来，之后就不准她再开这扇门了。</td>
		<td class="en">Once more the rabbit was wrapped in the old pit-singlet.But now it was carried into the scullery and put under the copper fire-place, that it might imagine itself inside a burrow.The saucers were placed about, four or five, here and there on the floor, so that if the little creature should chance to hop abroad, it could not fail to come upon some food.After this my mother was allowed to take from the scullery what she wanted and then she was forbidden to open the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天天刚刚亮，我就下楼了。一打开洗涤间的门，我便听到有轻微的拖着脚走的声音。接着我看见遍地湿湿的牛奶，盘里有小小的兔子粪便。那个坏东西蹲在靴子后面露出它的耳朵尖。我偷偷看着它。它坐在那里，明亮的眼睛斜视着，鼻子一动一动的，似乎是在看我，似乎又不是。</td>
		<td class="en">When morning came and it was light, I went downstairs.Opening the scullery door, I heard a slight scuffle.Then I saw dabbles of milk all over the floor and tiny rabbit-droppings in the saucers.And there the miscreant, the tips of his ears showing behind a pair of boots.I peeped at him.He sat bright-eyed and askance, twitching his nose and looking at me while not looking at me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它活着，而且活力十足。即使如此，我们还是担心会打扰到那属于它的世界。</td>
		<td class="en">He was alive—very much alive.But still we were afraid to trespass much on his confidence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“爸爸！”父亲被挡在了门口。“爸爸，小兔子活着。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Father!”My father was arrested at the door.“Father, the rabbit’s alive.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你也活过来了吧。”父亲说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Back your life it is,” said my father.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“进去的时候注意点。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mind how you go in.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >无论如何，到了晚上的时候，这个小东西开始变得听话了，相当听话。我们叫它阿道夫。大家都被它迷住了。我们不能真心去爱它，因为它是只野兔，终究不懂得爱。但是它能带来纯粹的快乐。</td>
		<td class="en">By evening, however, the little creature was tame, quite tame.He was christened Adolf.We were enchanted by him.We couldn’t really love him, because he was wild and loveless to the end.But he was an unmixed delight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大家一致认为它太小了，不能呆在笼子里，必须在房子里自由活动。母亲反对，但是无济于事。它实在太小了。我们把它带上楼去，它竟把粪便粒拉到了床上，我们都被逗乐了。</td>
		<td class="en">We decided he was too small to live in a hutch—he must live at large in the house.My mother protested, but in vain.He was so tiny.So we had him upstairs, and he dropped his tiny pills on the bed and we were enchanted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿道夫一下就适应了这里。它满屋子跑着，把家具后面的角落都当成它的地道和巢穴，其乐无穷。</td>
		<td class="en">Adolf made himself instantly at home.He had the run of the house, and was perfectly happy, with his tunnels and his holes behind the furniture.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们都喜欢它和我们一起吃饭。它坐在桌上，弓着背，吮吸着牛奶，抖抖它的毛须和柔嫩的耳朵，时不时跳出几步，然后又摇摇晃晃地走回到它的碟子旁边来，一副什么都不关心的样子。有时它又会突然警惕起来。它摇摇晃晃地走几小步，抬起身子好奇地看着糖罐。它挥着小小的前爪，然后把它们放在糖罐边缘，伸长瘦瘦的脖子向糖罐里偷看。它冲着糖抖了抖胡须，尽最大的努力想要掰下一块糖。</td>
		<td class="en">We loved him to take meals with us.He would sit on the table humping his back, sipping his milk, shaking his whiskers and his tender ears, hopping off and hobbling back to his saucer, with an air of supreme unconcern.Suddenly he was alert.He hobbled a few tiny paces, and reared himself up inquisitively at the sugar-basin.He fluttered his tiny fore-paws, and then reached and laid them on the edge of the basin, whilst he craned his thin neck and peeped in.He trembled his whiskers at the sugar, then did his best to lift down a lump.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们别以为我会让它这样！动物居然跑到糖罐里！”妈妈大喊道，手敲着桌子。</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you think I will have it!Animals in the sugar pot!” cried my mother, with a rap of her hand on the table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这反倒使阿道夫像触了电般地抽动了一下后腿，踢倒了一个茶杯。</td>
		<td class="en">Which so delighted the electric Adolf that he flung his hind-quarters and knocked over a cup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是你自己的错，妈妈。如果你不管它的话——”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s your own fault, mother.If you left him alone—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它继续和我们喝茶。它非常喜欢喝热茶。它还喜欢糖。咬一小口糖块后，它把目标转移到了黄油上。这时它被母亲的嘘声赶走了。但它很快便学会对母亲的嘘声置之不理。母亲仍然很讨厌它把鼻子凑到食物跟前。但它很喜欢这样。有一天，二者在较量中打翻了奶油罐。阿道夫的胸膛被奶油淹没，它吓得跳了起来，但妈妈揪住它的小耳朵，把它扔到了炉边的地毯上。它在那直发抖，一瞬间很不舒服，然后突然发了狂似的冲到客厅。</td>
		<td class="en">He continued to take tea with us.He rather liked warm tea.And he loved sugar.Having nibbled a lump, he would turn to the butter.There he was shooed off by our parent.He soon learned to treat her shooing with indifference.Still, she hated him to put his nose in the food.And he loved to do it.And so one day between them they overturned the cream-jug.Adolf deluged his little chest, bounced back in terror, was seized by his little ears by my mother and bounced down on the hearth-rug.There he shivered in momentary discomfort, and suddenly set off in a wild flight to the parlour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这里是它的最后一片乐土。它已经养成了一种坏习惯，喜欢带着一副心事重重的样子啃咬炉前的地毯。如果从这里被赶走了，它就会退避到沙发下面。它会像佛教徒般沉思静坐在那儿，眼睛一眨一眨。一会儿，它又莫名其妙像警钟突然响起般猛然跑开。一阵乱窜乱撞之后，它飞速跑出客厅，穿过门口时小耳朵在空中上下飞摆着。这时，我们便会听到它在客厅里电闪雷鸣般地横冲直撞。还没等我们跟过去，阿道夫又飞速从我们面前跑过去，在洗涤间风驰电掣般扫上一圈，又窜回客厅，这个疯狂的小家伙像个球似的在客厅里疯狂地飞奔。在这一阵疯狂之后，它就会静静地呆在角落里，坐得远远的，若有所思地抖动着胡须。就算我们质问它这突如其来的疯狂举动，也无济于事。它就像枪发射子弹一样爆发，过后又像发射后的枪一样静静地冒着烟。</td>
		<td class="en">This last was his happy hunting ground.He had cultivated the bad habit of pensively nibbling certain bits of cloth in the hearth-rug.When chased from this pasture, he would retreat under the sofa.There he would twinkle in Buddhist meditation until suddenly, no one knew why, he would go off like an alarum clock.With a sudden bumping scuffle he would whirl out of the room, going through the doorway with his little ears flying.Then we would hear his thunder-bolt hurtling in the parlour, but before we could follow, the wild streak of Adolf would flash past us, on an electric wind that swept him round the scullery and carried him back, a little mad thing, flying possessed like a ball round the parlour.After which ebullition he would sit in a corner composed and distant, twitching his whiskers in abstract meditation.And it was in vain we questioned him about his outbursts.He just went off like a gun, and was as calm after it as a gun that smokes placidly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哎呀，它长得可真快！想把它成天关在屋里是不可能了。</td>
		<td class="en">Alas, he grew up rapidly.It was almost impossible to keep him from the outer door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，我们正在栅门边玩耍，我看见它棕色的身影徘徊着穿过马路，然后跑进了房子对面的田野。我们立即喊了一声：“阿道夫！”它对这声音再熟悉不过了。突然，一阵风把它刮到草地的斜坡上，它的尾巴在草里轻快地弯曲晃动着。我们在它后面追赶。它那样子我们从未见过，耳朵向后张，小小的腰显得格外有力，把整个世界都抛在身后了。我们在后面追得上气不接下气，但是还是没能赶上它。这时，有人挡住了它，它就干脆漫不经心地在一束荨麻下坐下，鼻子一动一动的。</td>
		<td class="en">One day, as we were playing by the stile, I saw his brown shadow loiter across the road and pass into the field that faced the houses.Instantly a cry of “Adolf!” a cry he knew full well.And instantly a wind swept him away down the sloping meadow, his tail twinkling and zigzagging through the grass.After him we pelted.It was a strange sight to see him, ears back, his little loins so powerful, flinging the world behind him.We ran ourselves out of breath, but could not catch him.Then somebody headed him off, and he sat with sudden unconcern, twitching his nose under a bunch of nettles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它随便乱逛，终于有一回受到了惊吓。一个周日的早晨，父亲刚和一个小贩吵了一架。我们在屋里听着这事的结果，这时突然从院子里传来一声怪叫。我们飞奔出去。阿道夫畏缩在板凳下面，同时一只黑白相间的大猫在几码远的地方目不转睛地瞪着它。这一幕令人终生难忘。阿道夫转了转眼睛，张开它那异样的嘴巴又尖叫了一声，大猫慢慢拉长身体向前爬着。</td>
		<td class="en">His wanderings cost him a shock.One Sunday morning my father had just been quarreling with a pedlar, and we were hearing the aftermath indoors, when there came a sudden unearthly scream from the yard.We flew out.There sat Adolf cowering under a bench, whilst a great black and white cat glowered intently at him, a few yards away.Sight not to be forgotten.Adolf rolling back his eyes and parting his strange muzzle in another scream, the cat stretching forward in a slow elongation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >嘿，我们真讨厌那只猫！它被我们赶得翻过了教堂的墙，又穿过邻居的花园。</td>
		<td class="en">Ha, how we hated that cat!How we pursued him over the chapel wall and across the neighbours’ gardens.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿道夫还是没有完全长大。</td>
		<td class="en">Adolf was still only half grown.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“猫！”母亲喊道。“这些丑陋讨厌的猫，为什么还有人要养它们呢！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Cats!” said my mother.“Hideous detestable animals, why do people harbour them!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，阿道夫也没给她好日子过。到处都是它的粪便。母亲一个人在家的时候，阿道夫突然从楼上下来的声音会把她吓得够呛。把它成天关在屋里是不可能了。但是那些猫成天在外面晃悠。这比照顾一个小孩还麻烦。</td>
		<td class="en">But Adolf was becoming too much for her.He dropped too many pills.And suddenly to hear him clumping downstairs when she was alone in the house was startling.And to keep him from the door was impossible.Cats prowled outside.It was worse than having a child to look after.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，我们还是不会把它关在屋里。它越来越精力旺盛，也越来越无情。它踢人踢得可狠了，而且还经常抓伤我们的脸和胳膊。但是它也有自作自受的时候。客厅里挂着的网眼纱帘——我母亲特别喜欢它们——长长地垂到了地上。阿道夫的乐趣之一是在窗帘里面乱跑乱窜，就好像在浓密的矮树丛里一样。它已经把纱帘弄出裂缝了。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet we would not have him shut up.He became more lusty, more callous than ever.He was a strong kicker, and many a scratch on face and arms did we owe to him.But he brought his own doom on himself.The lace curtains in the parlour—my mother was rather proud of them—fell on to the floor very full.One of Adolf’s joys was to scuffle wildly through them as though through some foamy undergrowth.He had already torn rents in them.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One day he entangled himself altogether.He kicked, he whirled round in a mad nebulous inferno.He screamed—and brought down the curtain-rod with a smash, right on the best beloved pelargonium, just as my mother rushed in.She extricated him, but she never forgave him.And he never forgave either.A heartless wildness had come over him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >连我们也明白它必须离开了。深思熟虑之后，我们决定让父亲把它放回到野外去。于是，它又被装到了父亲矿工服的大口袋里。</td>
		<td class="en">Even we understood that he must go.It was decided, after a long deliberation, that my father should carry him back to the wild-woods.Once again he was stowed into the great pocket of the pit-jacket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干脆把它打死在罐子里得了。”父亲开玩笑说，他总喜欢这样故意挑起众怒。</td>
		<td class="en">“Best pop him i’ th’ pot,” said my father, who enjoyed raising the wind of indignation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天，父亲说他把阿道夫放到小树林边上时，它就无动于衷地跳着跑了，看上去既不欢快，也不感动。听了这话，我们也就相信了。但大家心里都不好受。其他的兔子会对它好吗？它们会嗅出它被驯化过的味道吗？会看出它因为被驯养过而退化了吗？会因此把它撕成两半吗？母亲对这个荒唐看法嗤之以鼻。</td>
		<td class="en">And so, next day, our father said that Adolf, set down on the edge of the coppice, had hopped away with utmost indifference, neither elated nor moved.We heard it and believed.But many, many were the heartsearchings.How would the other rabbits receive him?Would they smell his tameness, his humanized degradation, and rend him?My mother pooh-poohed the extravagant idea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，它终究是走了，我们都轻松了不少。父亲还留意着它。他说他好几次一大早经过那片小树林时，看见阿道夫躲在荨麻丛后面偷看他。他曾大声地以一种古怪的、诱哄似的嗓音喊过它。但是阿道夫没有应答。这些小东西很快就恢复了野性。它们对人类的平淡枯燥不屑一顾。至少我是这么觉得的。我自己也会去小树林的边上，轻轻地叫它。我想象着荨麻丛里的明亮眼睛和嘲笑般闪过蕨丛的白色尾巴。就是当阿道夫把屁股对着我们时竖起的那条放肆的尾巴。这总使我想起一个很无礼的手势，一个不宜于书面地表达、甚至连暗示也不行的词语。</td>
		<td class="en">However, he was gone, and we were rather relieved.My father kept an eye open for him.He declared that several times, passing the coppice in the early morning, he had seen Adolf peeping through the nettlestalks.He had called him, in an odd, high-voiced, cajoling fashion.But Adolf had not responded.Wildness gains so soon upon its creatures.And they become so contemptuous then of our tame presence.So it seemed to me.I myself would go to the edge of the coppice, and call softly.I myself would imagine bright eyes between the nettle-stalks, flash of a white, scornful tail past the bracken.That insolent white tail, as Adolf turned his flank on us!It reminded me always of a certain rude gesture, and a certain unprintable phrase, which may not even be suggested.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可当动物学家们讨论白兔尾巴的意义时，兔子那下流的姿态和那描述它的更加粗俗不堪的字眼总会闪现在我的脑海里。动物学家们称，兔子露出自己的白尾巴是为了安全地指引小兔子尾随其后，就像保姆挥动着带子是为了示意蹒跚学步的小孩紧跟在她后面一样。多么讨人喜欢，又多么天真啊！但我只知道阿道夫并不幼稚。它曾经将它的屁股对着我，把它白色的尾毛蹭到我眼睛里说“妈的！”（注：Merde，法语，意为“妈的”！）这是一个粗俗的词语，但是阿道夫却经常傲慢地撅着它的小屁股，晃着尾巴对我骂这样的脏话。</td>
		<td class="en">But when naturalists discuss the meaning of the white rabbit’s tail, that rude gesture and still ruder phrase always come to my mind.Naturalists say that the rabbit shows his white tail in order to guide his young safely after him, as a nurse-maid’s flying strings are the signal to her toddling charges to follow on.How nice and naive!I only know that my Adolf wasn’t naive.He used to whisk his flank at me, push his white feather in my eye, and say Merde!(note: Merde!: Shit!(French))It’s a rude word—but one which Adolf was always semaphoring at me, flag-wagging it with all the derision of his narrow haunches.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这就是野兔的德行——傲慢，它们就是喜欢摇那白色的尾巴不怀好意地嘲弄人。没错，它坚持不忘挥动它那白色的旗帜，真是个行为不羁、傲慢无礼的坏家伙。看它是如何逃命的。他受了极大的惊吓，慌忙地夺路而逃，像旋风一样。他甩动后腿，速度惊人地疯狂逃跑，把一切都抛在后面。它把脑袋蜷了起来，耳朵耷拉在两侧，转动眼白，疯狂逃命。它知道身后逼近自己的东西有多可怕：要么是子弹，要么是白鼬。它知道！它知道！它的眼睛朝后仰着几乎到了头顶。那是一种痛苦。也是一种疯狂。疯狂！看它傲慢地晃动它那白色的旗子。恐惧的魔力使它狂奔。被禁锢的灵魂已全然淹没在极度的惶恐中，痛苦不堪。它还是继续猛冲，犹如一颗流星般继而陨落、消失。这是恐惧煎熬的白色烈焰。此刻，它那条白色的尾巴不停地摆动。摆啊！摆啊！白色的尾巴像在说：妈的！妈的！妈的！它冲着追逐者喊骂着。这是野兔的个性使然，对此它自己也毫无办法。就算是死到临头了，它还是在侮辱后面的追逐者。它亡命却不被挫败，温顺却不曾屈服。难怪白鼬对它怀恨在心。</td>
		<td class="en">That’s a rabbit all over—insolence, and the white flag of spiteful derision.Yes, and he keeps his flag flying to the bitter end, sporting, insolent little devil that he is.See him running for his life.Oh, how his soul is fanned to an ecstasy of fright, a fugitive whirl-wind of panic.Gone mad, he throws the world behind him, with astonishing hind legs.He puts back his head and lays his ears on his sides and rolls the white of his eyes in sheer ecstatic agony of speed.He knows the awful approach behind him: bullet or stoat.He knows!He knows, his eyes are turned back almost into his head.It is agony.But it is also ecstasy.Ecstasy!See the insolent white flag bobbing.He whirls on the magic wind of terror.All his pent-up soul rushes into agonized electric emotion of fear.He flings himself on, like a falling star swooping into extinction.White heat of the agony of fear.And at the same time, bob!bob!bob!goes the white tail, merde!merde!merde!it says to the pursuer.The rabbit can’t help it.In his utmost extremity he still flings the insult at the pursuer.He is the inconquerable fugitive, the indomitable meek.No wonder the stoat becomes vindictive.</td></tr>
