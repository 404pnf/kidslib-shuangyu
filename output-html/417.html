		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Once there was a bad little boy whose name was Jim—though, if you will notice, you will find that bad little boys are nearly always called James in your Sunday-school books.</td>
		<td class="en">从前有个坏孩子，名叫吉姆——不过如果你留心注意，你会发现在主日学校的课本里，几乎所有的坏孩子都叫詹姆斯。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was strange, but still it was true, that this one was called Jim.</td>
		<td class="en">虽然奇怪但又千真万确，这个坏孩子就叫吉姆。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He didn’t have any sick mother, either—a sick mother who was pious and had the consumption, and would be glad to lie down in the grave and be at rest but for the strong love she bore her boy, and the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh and cold toward him when she was gone.</td>
		<td class="en">他没有疾病缠身的母亲——一个虔诚信神的、害痨病的母亲，她很乐意躺入坟墓长眠，但是出于对自己孩子强烈的爱，担心自己离世后孩子会受到世人的排斥和冷眼。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Most bad boys in the Sunday books are named James, and have sick mothers, who teach them to say, “Now, I lay me down,” etc., and sing them to sleep with sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss them good night, and kneel down by the bedside and weep.</td>
		<td class="en">主日学校课本里的大多数坏孩子都叫詹姆斯，并且有个患病的母亲。她们教他们说“现在，让我躺下吧！”之类的话语，给他们唱甜美凄婉的安眠曲，与他们亲吻道晚安，跪在他们的床边伤心啜泣。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But it was different with this fellow.</td>
		<td class="en">然而这个家伙跟那些孩子不一样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He was named Jim, and there wasn’t anything the matter with his mother—no consumption, nor anything of that kind.</td>
		<td class="en">虽然他也叫吉姆，但是他的妈妈身体很健康——没有痨病，也没有别的毛病。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >She was rather stout than otherwise, and she was not pious; moreover, she was not anxious on Jim’s account.</td>
		<td class="en">恰恰相反，他妈妈身体相当强壮，也不是虔诚信神，再者，她从不为吉姆担心。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >She said if he were to break his neck it wouldn’t be much loss.</td>
		<td class="en">她说过，就算吉姆折断了脖子，那也没有多大的损失。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >She always spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissed him good night; on the contrary, she boxed his ears when she was ready to leave him.</td>
		<td class="en">她总是拍打吉姆的屁股催他睡觉，从来不与他吻别道晚安。相反，起身离开时她还会赏他几个耳光。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry, and slipped in there and helped himself to some jam, and filled up the vessel with tar, so that his mother would never know the difference; but all at once a terrible feeling didn’t come over him, and something didn’t seem to whisper to him, “Is it right to disobey my mother?</td>
		<td class="en">有一次，这个小坏蛋偷了食品储藏室的钥匙，溜进去偷吃了一些果酱。为了不让妈妈发现破绽，他往瓶里灌了些焦油。做这些事时，他并没有突然感到一丝愧疚，似乎也没有人在他耳畔轻言细语：“欺骗母亲是对的吗？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Isn’t it sinful to do this?</td>
		<td class="en">做这种事难道不应该愧疚吗？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Where do bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother’s jam?” and then he didn’t kneel down all alone and promise never to be wicked any more, and rise up with a light, happy heart, and go and tell his mother all about it, and beg her forgiveness, and be blessed by her with tears of pride and thankfulness in her eyes.</td>
		<td class="en">偷吃慈爱妈妈的果酱的坏孩子将会受到怎样的惩罚呢？”之后，他没有独自跪下忏悔，并保证今后再也不干这种坏事，然后怀着轻松快乐的心情重新站起来，跑向母亲，把自己的所作所为告诉她，并恳求她的原谅，幸福地看着母亲饱含热泪地为他的悔过和诚实感到无比骄傲和感恩。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >No; that is the way with all other bad boys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this Jim, strangely enough.</td>
		<td class="en">不是这样！书本中的其他坏孩子都会这样做，但是吉姆绝对不会，这确实很奇怪。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in his sinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that was bully also, and laughed, and observed “that the old woman would get up and snort” when she found it out; and when she did find it out, he denied knowing anything about it, and she whipped him severely, and he did the crying himself.</td>
		<td class="en">他只会边吃果酱边满不在乎且粗鲁地说这样很好，往瓶里灌焦油时也说这样很好。他会大笑着说，当那个老太婆发现实情后“一定会暴跳如雷”。等他妈妈真的发现后质问他时，他却拒不承认。他妈妈用鞭子狠狠地打了他一顿，他则痛哭流涕一通。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Everything about this boy was curious—everything turned out differently with him from the way it does to the bad Jameses in the books.</td>
		<td class="en">所有发生在他身上的事都很离奇——一切都与书本上坏孩子詹姆斯的所作所为迥然不同。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Once he climbed up in Farmer Acorn’s apple tree to steal apples, and the limb didn’t break, and he didn’t fall and break his arm, and get torn by the farmer’s great dog, and then languish on a sickbed for weeks, and repent and become good.</td>
		<td class="en">一次，他爬上农场主艾科恩家的苹果树去偷苹果，树枝并没有折断，他也没有从树上跌落下来摔断胳膊，并被主人家的大猎犬撕咬得皮开肉绽，然后在病床上憔悴地躺上几个星期，从此洗心革面，变得乖巧听话。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Oh, no; he stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right; and he was all ready for the dog, too, and knocked him endways with a brick when he came to tear him.</td>
		<td class="en">不，不是这样。事实恰好相反，他偷了个盆满钵满，而且安然无恙地从树上下来了。对于那只猎狗，他是早有准备，当它扑过来咬他时，他就用砖头竖着打它。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was very strange—nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books with marbled backs, and with pictures in them of men with swallow-tailed coats and bell-crowned hats, and pantaloons that are short in the legs, and women with the waists of their dresses under their arms, and no hoops on.</td>
		<td class="en">说也奇怪——在那些故事温和的小书里从来不会发生这样的事。那些书有云纹封底，里面有许多插图，插图上的绅士们都头戴钟形帽，身穿燕尾服，腿着短靴裤；淑女们也是腋下穿着紧身背心，裙子不用裙环撑开。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Nothing like it in any of the Sunday-school books.</td>
		<td class="en">在主日学校课本里根本找不到吉姆这样的故事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Once he stole the teacher’s penknife, and, when he was afraid it would be found out and he would get whipped, he slipped it into George Wilson’s cap poor Widow Wilson’s son, the moral boy, the good little boy of the village, who always obeyed his mother, and never told an untruth, and was fond of his lessons, and infatuated with Sunday-school.</td>
		<td class="en">还有一次，吉姆偷拿了老师的铅笔刀，害怕老师发现后挨鞭子，他就悄悄将小刀塞进了乔治·威尔逊的帽子里。乔治·威尔逊是可怜的寡妇威尔逊的儿子，他正直诚恳，是村里的模范好孩子，从不忤逆妈妈，从不撒谎，勤奋好学，非常喜欢去主日学校。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And when the knife dropped from the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed, as if in conscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon him, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down upon his trembling shoulders, a white-haired, improbable justice of the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strike an attitude and say, “Spare this noble boy—there stands the cowering culprit!</td>
		<td class="en">可是当铅笔刀从帽子里滑落了出来时，可怜的乔治低垂着头，满面通红，愧疚不已，就好像真是他偷了铅笔刀似的。老师很生气，认定他就是小偷。就在老师的教鞭要抽打到那男孩颤抖的肩膀时，并没有那种罕见的、白发苍苍的治安官突然出现在他们中间，装腔作势地告诉大家：“饶了这个高尚的小家伙吧——作恶的人畏缩地站在那里呢！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I was passing the school door at recess, and, unseen myself, I saw the theft committed!”</td>
		<td class="en">在你们休息的时候，我正从校门口经过，我也没看到我，而我却目睹了行窃的经过！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And then Jim didn’t get whaled, and the venerable justice didn’t read the tearful school a homily, and take George by the hand and say such boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him come and make his home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, and run errands, and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife do household labors, and have all the balance of the time to play and get forty cents a month, and be happy.</td>
		<td class="en">吉姆没有受到应有的惩罚，因为德高望重的法官并没有现身对着泪眼汪汪的师生说教一番，拉着乔治的手并当众赞扬他，然后让乔治跟他回家，并让他打扫办公室、生火、跑腿打杂、劈柴、学习法律以及帮他的妻子做做家务活，剩下的时间他可以尽情玩耍，每个月还能拿到四十美分的工资，从此过上美满的生活。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >No it would have happened that way in the books, but didn’t happen that way to Jim.</td>
		<td class="en">不，不是这样。在主日学校书本里会有这样的故事，但是绝对不会发生在吉姆的生活里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make trouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim was glad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys.</td>
		<td class="en">那种爱管闲事的老法官并没有出现并挑起事端，乖孩子小乔治因而也遭到老师的鞭打。吉姆则在一旁幸灾乐祸，因为，你知道的，他很憎恨循规蹈矩的好孩子。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Jim said he was “down on them milksops.”</td>
		<td class="en">吉姆说他自己“最瞧不起那些软骨头”。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Such was the coarse language of this bad, neglected boy.</td>
		<td class="en">这就是没教养的坏孩子吉姆说的粗俗话。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim was the time he went boating on Sunday, and didn’t get drowned, and that other time that he got caught out in the storm when he was fishing on Sunday and didn’t get struck by lightning.</td>
		<td class="en">但是发生在吉姆身上最让人费解的是，他星期天去划船，竟然没有被淹死。更有甚者，他星期天外出钓鱼时遇到了暴风雨，却没有被雷电劈死。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Why, you might look, and look, all through the Sunday-school books from now till next Christmas, and you would never come across anything like this.</td>
		<td class="en">相信就算你从现在起，一直翻书翻到圣诞节，你也不会在主日学校课本里找到类似离奇的事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Oh, no; you would find that all the bad boys who go boating on Sunday invariably get drowned; and all the bad boys who get caught out in storms when they are fishing on Sunday infallibly get struck by lightning.</td>
		<td class="en">不，不是这样。在书本里，你会发现星期天去划船的坏孩子全都溺水身亡，无一例外；星期天去钓鱼的坏孩子全都遭遇到暴风雨并被雷电击中，绝无特例。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Boats with bad boys in them always upset on Sunday, and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the Sabbath.</td>
		<td class="en">因为坏孩子乘的船总是会在星期天被打翻；如果坏孩子在安息日出门钓鱼，也总会遭遇到暴风雨。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >How this Jim ever escaped is a mystery to me.</td>
		<td class="en">至于这个吉姆如何总幸免于难，一直是个谜。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This Jim bore a charmed life—that must have been the way of it.</td>
		<td class="en">吉姆就像是受到符咒的庇护，我想也一定是这样的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Nothing could hurt him.</td>
		<td class="en">什么都伤害不了他。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He even gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of tobacco, and the elephant didn’t knock the top of his head off with his trunk.</td>
		<td class="en">在动物园，他甚至将一捆烟草塞进大象的嘴里，可是大象却没有用它的长鼻子敲碎他的头顶。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He browsed around the cupboard after essence-of peppermint, and didn’t make a mistake and drink aqua fortis.</td>
		<td class="en">为了找薄荷露，他把壁橱翻个底朝天，却从未错喝过硝酸溶液。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He stole his father’s gun and went hunting on the Sabbath, and didn’t shoot three or four of his fingers off.</td>
		<td class="en">有时候在安息日里，他偷了父亲的猎枪去打猎，也从未失手炸断几根手指头。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He struck his little sister on the temple with his fist when he was angry, and she didn’t linger in pain through long summer days, and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips that redoubled the anguish of his breaking heart.</td>
		<td class="en">生气时，他用拳头砸小妹妹的额头，但是小妹妹也并没有疼得整个夏天躺在病床上呻吟，最后临死前轻声地对他说她原谅了他的宽慰话语，因此令他感到倍加痛苦和伤心。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >No; she got over it.</td>
		<td class="en">不，不是这样。她居然熬过了那一拳头，康复了！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He ran off and went to sea at last, and didn’t come back and find himself sad and alone in the world, his loved ones sleeping in the quiet churchyard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhood tumbled down and gone to decay.</td>
		<td class="en">最后他逃离了家园，当了水手。再次回来时，他也没觉得自己孤身一人在世而觉得凄惨，亲人们也没有长眠在安静的墓地，童年时居住的那座青藤环绕的房子也没有坍塌、破败不堪。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Ah, no; he came home as drunk as a piper, and got into the station-house the first thing.</td>
		<td class="en">不，不是这样。回乡时，他烂醉如泥，还未踏进家门就先进了派出所。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And he grew up and married, and raised a large family, and brained them all with an ax one night, and got wealthy by all manner of cheating and rascality; and now he is the infernalest wickedest scoundrel in his native village, and is universally respected, and belongs to the legislature.</td>
		<td class="en">成年之后，他结婚了，养了许多孩子。但是一天晚上，他用斧头砸烂了所有家人的脑袋。他用尽坑蒙拐骗的手段，变得十分富有；现在他是横行乡里的最可恨最邪恶的无赖，但是居然普遍受人尊敬，而且还当加入了州议会。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So you see there never was a bad James in the Sunday-school books that had such a streak of luck as this sinful Jim with the charmed life.</td>
		<td class="en">因此你们看看，主日学校的课本里的坏詹姆斯，有哪个能像这个吉姆一样幸运，作恶多端，却能过得这般逍遥自在！</td></tr>
