		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人人都说他配不上她，但她仍不后悔嫁给他。他十九岁就开始追求她，那时她二十岁。他就是人们常说的那种紧实的小个子。他身材矮小，皮肤黝黑，脸色健康，总是一副昂首挺胸的样子，招摇的举止让人想到寻偶的鸟儿——浑身都充满着活力。他工作卖力，在矿上的收入很高，加上家境也不错，所以攒下了一点钱。</td>
		<td class="en">She was too good for him, everybody said.Yet still she did not regret marrying him.He had come courting her when he was only nineteen, and she twenty.He was in build what they call a tight little fellow; short, dark, with a warm colour, and that upright set of the head and chest, that flaunting way in movement recalling a mating bird, which denotes a body taut and compact with life.Being a good worker he had earned decent money in the mine, and having a good home had saved a little.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她本是“高地”的厨子，又高又漂亮的一个姑娘，而且非常文静。一看见她走在街上，霍斯普尔就会远远地跟着——他被她迷住了。他不喝酒，人也挺勤快。虽然看上去有点傻，不太机灵，但他总有一股子活力。于是经过一番考虑，她还是接受了她。</td>
		<td class="en">She was a cook at “Uplands”, a tall, fair girl, very quiet.Having seen her walk down the street, Horsepool had followed her from a distance. He was taken with her, he did not drink, and he was not lazy.So, although he seemed a bit simple, without much intelligence, but having a sort of physical brightness, she considered, and accepted him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >婚后，他们一起布置了位于斯卡吉尔街上的新家，然后搬进了这幢体面的六居室房子。这条街坐落在一条又长又陡的山坡上。街道很窄，就像一条地道。然而，街尾却与一片牧场相连，更远一些是一条布满田野和森林的大峡谷，煤矿就隐没在峡谷底部。</td>
		<td class="en">When they were married they went to live in Scargill Street, in a highly respectable six-roomed house which they had furnished between them.The street was built up the side of a long, steep hill.It was narrow and rather tunnel-like.Nevertheless, the back looked out over the adjoining pasture, across a wide valley of fields and woods, in the bottom of which the mine lay snugly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >威利在家就像个乡下老头一样威风。她对矿工的生活方式并不熟悉。他们在某个星期六结婚了。</td>
		<td class="en">He made himself gaffer in his own house.She was unacquainted with a collier’s mode of life.They were married on a Saturday.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >星期天晚上，他就对她说：“给我准备好早饭放餐桌上，把我下井用的东西放火炉前。”我明早五点半起床。你想啥时候起床，就啥时候起床。”</td>
		<td class="en">On the Sunday night he said: “Set th’ table for my breakfast, an’ put my pit-things afront o’ th’ fire.I s’ll be gettin’ up at ha’ef pas’ five.Tha nedna shift thysen not till when ter likes.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >见她疑惑不解，他说：“我早晨不用你那些白桌布，这样的话我想随便一点，也不用担心弄脏桌布了。”</td>
		<td class="en">When she demurred, “I want none o’ your white cloths i’ th’ mornin’.I like ter be able to slobber if I feel like it,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把厚毛头工装裤、干净汗衫（厚绒背心）、长袜以及下井穿的靴子都整理好，放在炉火前烘干，以便第二天清早穿。</td>
		<td class="en">He put before the fire his moleskin trousers, a clean singlet, or sleeveless vest of thick flannel, a pair of stockings and his pit boots, arranging them all to be warm and ready for morning.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你都看到了，这些事情都得在每天晚上做好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now tha sees.That wants doin’ ivery night.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天早上五点半，他准时出门，没做任何形式的告别，穿上衬衣就下了楼。</td>
		<td class="en">Punctually at half past five he left her, without any form of leave-taking, going downstairs in his shirt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他下午四点回到家时，晚餐已经准备好了，只等着上菜了。他走进屋里，那矮小壮实的身板，加上一张黑得难以形容的脸，还抹得一道一道的，真把她吓了一跳。她穿着白色的上衣，系着白围裙，站在火炉前，好一个漂亮的姑娘，宛如一幅美丽洁净的画。他穿着大皮靴“扑通扑通”地走了进来。</td>
		<td class="en">When he arrived home at four o’clock in the afternoon his dinner was ready to be dished up.She was startled when he came in, a short, sturdy figure, with a face indescribably black and streaked.She stood before the fire in her white blouse and white apron, a fair girl, the picture of beautiful cleanliness.He “clommaxed” in, in his heavy boots.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今天过得怎么样？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, how ’as ter gone on?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我正等你回来。”她温柔地答道。他看着她，黝黑的脸上那对棕色眼睛里的眼白在闪闪发光。</td>
		<td class="en">“I was ready for you to come home,” she replied tenderly.In his black face the whites of his brown eyes flashed at her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也想着回家呢。”他边说边把锡水壶、干粮袋放在碗柜上，然后脱下外套和背心，取下围巾，把自己的扶手椅往火炉边拉了拉，坐了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">“An’ I wor ready for comin’,” he said. He planked his tin bottle and snap-bag on the dresser, took off his coat and scarf and waistcoat, dragged his arm-chair nearer the fire and sat down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“吃饭吧，我都饿扁了。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Let’s ha’e a bit o’ dinner, then—I’m about clammed,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不先洗洗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Aren’t you goin’ to wash yourself first?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干嘛要先洗洗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What am I to wesh mysen for?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不能就这样吃吧……”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, you can’t eat your dinner—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，这不多此一举嘛，老婆。在井下我不是也没洗就吃了吗？没办法呀。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, strike a daisy, Missis!Dunna I eat my snap i’ th’ pit wi’out weshin’?—forced to.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她端上饭菜，在他对面坐了下来。除了眼白和红色的嘴唇外，他那圆圆的小脑袋全都黑乎乎的。看着他吃饭时张开红色的嘴，露出白色的牙齿，她有种怪怪的感觉。他的胳膊和手上也沾上了斑斑点点的黑煤，只有肩膀上那裸露着的粗壮的脖子显得稍微干净点，这让她感到一丝安慰。屋里有一股淡淡的矿井里的、难以形容的气味，一种潮湿的废气的气味。</td>
		<td class="en">She served the dinner and sat opposite him.His small bullet head was quite black, save for the whites of his eyes and his scarlet lips.It gave her a queer sensation to see him open his red mouth and bare his white teeth as he ate.His arms and hands were mottled black; his bare, strong neck got a little fairer as it settled towards his shoulders, reassuring her.There was the faint indescribable odour of the pit in the room, an odour of damp, exhausted air.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“背心的肩膀那儿怎么那么黑啊？”她问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why is your vest so black on the shoulders?” she asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的汗衫？”那是矿井顶棚滴下来的水弄的。我出井穿上它时，已经干了。井里有根很大的管子可以晾衣服，我们换下来的衣服就都丢在上面晾干。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My singlet?That’s wi’ th’ watter droppin’ on us from th’ roof.This is a dry un as I put on afore I come up.They ha’e gre’t clothes-’osses, and as we change us things, we put ’em on theer ter dry.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >饭后，他光着上身跪在炉前地毯上擦澡时，她又一次觉得有点害怕。他是那么强健，看起来是那么认真、那么专注于自己所做的事情，就像一只精力充沛的野兽。而且当他站起来擦身子，裸露的胸脯对着她时，看着他粗壮的胳膊上隆起的一块块肌肉，她感到有些恶心。</td>
		<td class="en">When he washed himself, kneeling on the hearth-rug stripped to the waist, she felt afraid of him again.He was so muscular, he seemed so intent on what he was doing, so intensely himself, like a vigorous animal.And as he stood wiping himself, with his naked breast towards her, she felt rather sick, seeing his thick arms bulge their muscles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，他们过得很幸福。能娶到她，他感到无比自豪。矿工们爱拿他开玩笑，故意把他从她身边支开。但是，没有什么能减弱他以妻子为荣的自豪感，没有什么能动摇他那孩童般的满足。晚上，他就坐在椅子上和她聊天，或者听她给他念报纸。天气好的时候，他会像其他矿工一样来到街上，蹲靠在自家客厅的墙边，同一个又一个过路的人打招呼。没人的时候，他自己蹲着抽烟也乐在其中，心里感到无比地充实和满足。他娶了一个好妻子。</td>
		<td class="en">They were nevertheless very happy.He was at a great pitch of pride because of her.The men in the pit might chaff him, they might try to entice him away, but nothing could reduce his self-assured pride because of her, nothing could unsettle his almost infantile satisfaction.In the evening he sat in his armchair chattering to her, or listening as she read the newspaper to him.When it was fine, he would go into the street, squat on his heels as colliers do, with his back against the wall of his parlour, and call to the passers-by, in greeting, one after another.If no one were passing, he was content just to squat and smoke, having such a fund of sufficiency and satisfaction in his heart.He was well married.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们结婚不到一年，布伦特与韦尔伍德煤矿的工人们就闹起了罢工。威利是工会会员，所以他们的日子过得紧巴巴的。买家具的钱还没还清，新的债务又来了。她焦虑不安，想尽办法去还债，他却对此不闻不问。不过，他也算是个好丈夫，把所赚的钱都交给了她。</td>
		<td class="en">They had not been wed a year when all Brent and Wellwood’s men came out on strike.Willy was in the Union, so with a pinch they scrambled through.The furniture was not all paid for, and other debts were incurred.She worried and contrived, he left it to her.But he was a good husband; he gave her all he had.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >矿工们连续十五周没上工了。复工后刚满一年，威利就在矿井里出了事，弄伤了膀胱。在井下的煤道里，医生一说到要住院，这位年轻的矿工就完全失去了理智，疯子似的大喊大叫起来，既因为疼痛难耐，也因为对住院的恐惧。</td>
		<td class="en">The men were out fifteen weeks.They had been back just over a year when Willy had an accident in the mine, tearing his bladder.At the pit head the doctor talked of the hospital. Losing his head entirely, the young collier raved like a madman, what with pain and fear of hospital.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你可以回家，威利，可以回家。”工会代表连忙说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Tha s’lt go whoam, Willy, tha s’lt go whoam,” the deputy said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个年轻的矿工事先就通知了威利的妻子把床准备好。她二话没说就准备妥当了。然而，当救护车开来，听到被抬下车的丈夫疼得大喊大叫时，她真担心自己会撑不住。人们将他抬进了屋。</td>
		<td class="en">A lad warned the wife to have the bed ready.Without speaking or hesitating she prepared.But when the ambulance came, and she heard him shout with pain at being moved, she was afraid lest she should sink down.They carried him in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太太，你该在客厅里摆张床，”工会代表说，“这样，我们就不必把他抬到楼上，你也省得楼上楼下来回跑了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yo’ should ’a’ had a bed i’ th’ parlour, Missis,” said the deputy, “then we shouldn’a ha’ had to hawkse ’im upstairs, an’ it ’ud ’a’ saved your legs.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是现在已经来不及了。他们已经把他抬上楼了。</td>
		<td class="en">But it was too late now.They got him upstairs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“露西，他们就让我躺在那里，”他哭着说，“他们让我在煤堆上足足躺了要命的两小时才把我弄出矿井。真疼啊，露西，真疼。噢，露西，疼死了，疼死了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“They let me lie, Lucy,” he was crying, “they let me lie two mortal hours on th’ sleck afore they took me outer th’ stall.Th’ peen, Lucy, th’ peen; oh, Lucy, th’ peen, th’ peen!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我知道你疼得厉害，威利，我知道。但是你得尽量忍忍。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I know th’ pain’s bad, Willy, I know.But you must try an’ bear it a bit.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“小伙子，别这样，你的妻子会受不了的。”工会代表说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Tha manna carry on in that form, lad, thy missis ’ll niver be able ter stan’ it,” said the deputy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我受不了了，真的是太疼了。”他又哭喊开了。他这辈子还从没生过病呢！有时伤着手指，他也敢看伤口。但这次是来自体内的疼痛，这让他感到恐惧。最后，他终于精疲力竭，平静了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">“I canna ’elp it, it’s th’ peen, it’s th’ peen,” he cried again.He had never been ill in his life.When he had smashed a finger he could look at the wound.But this pain came from inside, and terrified him.At last he was soothed and exhausted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她费了好大工夫才帮他脱下衣服，擦洗干净。通常像他这种粗犷又朴实的人，绝不会让其他女人为他做这些事情的。</td>
		<td class="en">It was some time before she could undress him and wash him.He would let no other woman do for him, having that savage modesty usual in such men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在床上躺了六个星期，饱受病痛的折磨。医生们都不确定他到底怎么了，都不知如何是好。他能吃，也没变瘦，力气也还那么大，只是一直疼痛，几乎走不了路了。</td>
		<td class="en">For six weeks he was in bed, suffering much pain.The doctors were not quite sure what was the matter with him, and scarcely knew what to do.He could eat, he did not lose flesh, nor strength, yet the pain continued, and he could hardly walk at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >六个星期后，矿工们参加了全国总罢工。他早晨总是很早起床，坐在窗子旁边。罢工第二周的星期三，他像往常一样坐着注视着街道。他还是那个固执的年轻人，看上去精力充沛，只是脸上一副焦虑不安的神情。</td>
		<td class="en">In the sixth week the men came out in the national strike.He would get up quite early in the morning and sit by the window.On Wednesday, the second week of the strike, he sat gazing out on the street as usual, a bullet-headed young man, still vigorous-looking, but with a peculiar expression of hunted fear in his face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“露西，”他叫道，“露西！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Lucy,” he called, “Lucy!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到喊声，露西急忙跑上楼，脸色苍白，十分憔悴。</td>
		<td class="en">She, pale and worn, ran upstairs at his bidding.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“给我一条手帕。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Gi’e me a han’kercher,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么，你不是有一条了吗？”她走上前回答他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, you’ve got one,” she replied, coming near.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你别碰我。”他喊道。摸摸口袋，他掏出一条白手帕。</td>
		<td class="en">“Tha nedna touch me,” he cried.Feeling his pocket, he produced a white handkerchief.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不要白手帕，给我红的。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I non want a white un, gi’e me a red un,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“万一有人来看你呢。”她说着，递给他一条红色的手帕。</td>
		<td class="en">“An’ if anybody comes to see you,” she answered, giving him a red handkerchief.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再说，”她继续说道，“你也不必就为了这个把我叫上楼来呀。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Besides,” she continued, “you needn’t ha’ brought me upstairs for that.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我看又得疼了。”他的声音里带着一丝恐惧。</td>
		<td class="en">“I b’lieve th’ peen’s commin’ on again,” he said, with a little horror in his voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不会的，你知道不会的，”她回答说，“医生说，本来就不疼，是你想象的而已。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It isn’t, you know, it isn’t,” she replied.“The doctor says you imagine it’s there when it isn’t.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我难道连自己的感觉都分不清吗？”他嚷道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Canna I feel what’s inside me?” he shouted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有辆牵引车正往山下驶呢，”她说，“看那个会分散你的疼痛感。我要去把你的布丁给做了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s a traction-engine coming downhill,” she said.“That’ll scatter them.I’ll just go an’ finish your pudding.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说完她就出去了。牵引车驶过，房子都震动了起来。过后，除了人群，街上又安静了下来。一群十五到二十五岁的年轻人正在马路中间玩弹珠。另外几小群人则在人行道上玩耍。街上阴沉沉的。威利可以听到人们无休止的叫喊和吵闹声。</td>
		<td class="en">She left him.The traction-engine went by, shaking the houses.Then the street was quiet, save for the men.A gang of youths from fifteen to twenty-five years old were playing marbles in the middle of the road.Other little groups of men were playing on the pavement.The street was gloomy.Willy could hear the endless calling and shouting of men’s voices.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你捣鬼！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tha ’rt skinchin’!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我没有！”</td>
		<td class="en">“I arena!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把红球拿过来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come ’ere with that blood-alley.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“拿四个来和我换。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Swop us four for ’t.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不行，把那个给我。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Shonna, gie’s hold on ’t.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他想出去，他也想玩弹珠。疼痛削弱了他的意识，他几乎没法控制自己。</td>
		<td class="en">He wanted to be out, he wanted to be playing marbles.The pain had weakened his mind, so that he hardly knew any self-control.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时，又来了一群人懒散地在街上逛着。今早是发薪的日子。工会正在简陋的小教堂里发放津贴。从教堂出来时，人人都领了十先令。</td>
		<td class="en">Presently another gang of men lounged up the street.It was pay morning.The Union was paying the men in the Primitive Chapel.They were returning with their half-sovereigns.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对不起！”只听有人大叫道，“对不起！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sorry!” bawled a voice.“Sorry!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这词被用作了称呼语，很可能是“小子”这个词的误用。威利吓得差点从椅子上掉下来。</td>
		<td class="en">The word is a form of address, corruption probably of ‘Sirrah’.Willy started almost out of his chair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对不起！”那个大嗓门又喊起来，“谁想跟我一起去看诺丁汉队对维拉队的球赛？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sorry!” again bawled a great voice.“Art goin’ wi’ me to see Notts play Villa?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >许多玩弹珠的人立马站了起来。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >"有谁想去诺丁汉看球赛？"那个大嗓门又在喊。喊话的人是个大块头，喝得醉醺醺的，走路东倒西歪，帽子都遮过了眼睛。</td>
