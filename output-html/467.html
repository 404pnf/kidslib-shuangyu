		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >作者：杰克·伦敦尽管“奥雷号”看起来很笨重，但是它在微风中行进起来倒是很轻快。船长把它开到拍岸的海浪刚刚退去的地方才抛锚。环状的希库鲁珊瑚岛浅浅地浮在水面上，这个宽一百码、周长二十英里、由珊瑚围成的圆圈，比涨潮时的水位线高出三到五英尺。在宽广的、光亮如镜的环礁湖底，有很多珍珠贝。越过狭长的环状珊瑚岛，从这艘双桅帆船的甲板上望去，可以看见很多采珠人正在干活。但是，环礁湖的入口窄得连一艘商业的双桅帆船都开不进去。若是遇上顺风，单桅帆船或许能勉强通过那弯弯曲曲的、水位低浅的通道，而双桅帆船就不得不停在外面，打发它们的小艇进去。</td>
		<td class="en">by Jack LondonDespite the heavy clumsiness of her lines, the Aorai handled easily in the light breeze, and her captain ran her well in before he hove to just outside the suck of the surf.The atoll of Hikueru lay low on the water, a circle of pounded coral sand a hundred yards wide, twenty miles in circumference, and from three to five feet above high-water mark.On the bottom of the huge and glassy lagoon was much pearl shell, and from the deck of the schooner, across the slender ring of the atoll, the divers could be seen at work.But the lagoon had no entrance for even a trading schooner.With a favoring breeze cutters could win in through the tortuous and shallow channel, but the schooners lay off and on outside and sent in their small boats.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“奥雷号”利索地摆出一只小艇，六个褐色皮肤、只系着红色腰布的水手跳了进去。他们拿起了船桨。站在船尾掌舵的是个年轻人，他身上穿着白色热带服装，这表明他是个欧洲人。他那白皙的皮肤在阳光的照耀下隐隐透出玻里尼西亚人的金黄色调，使他“现了形”，他闪光的蓝眼睛里也闪耀着金色的光芒。他是拉乌尔，亚历山大·拉乌尔，玛丽·拉乌尔最小的儿子。玛丽·拉乌尔是一个富有的、有四分之一外来血统的女人，她拥有并且经营着六艘像“奥雷号”一样的双桅帆船。这只小艇穿过入口处的一个涡流，驶了进去，在汹涌翻腾的大浪里起伏颠簸，终于到了像明镜一样平静的环礁湖上。年轻的拉乌尔跳到白色的沙滩上，去跟一个个子高高的当地人握手。那人的胸膛和肩膀都很健壮，可是右胳膊只剩一截，露出肉外的骨头有几英寸长，因为时间长了，已经变成了白色。这说明他以前碰到过鲨鱼，使得他结束了他的采珠生涯而沦为一个为了蝇头小利拍马屁耍花招的人。</td>
		<td class="en">The Aorai swung out a boat smartly, into which sprang half a dozen brown-skinned sailors clad only in scarlet loincloths.They took the oars, while in the stern sheets, at the steering sweep, stood a young man garbed in the tropic white that marks the European.The golden strain of Polynesia betrayed itself in the sun-gilt of his fair skin and cast up golden sheens and lights through the glimmering blue of his eyes.Raoul he was, Alexandre Raoul, youngest son of Marie Raoul, the wealthy quarter-caste, who owned and managed half a dozen trading schooners similar to the Aorai.Across an eddy just outside the entrance, and in and through and over a boiling tide-rip, the boat fought its way to the mirrored calm of the lagoon.Young Raoul leaped out upon the white sand and shook hands with a tall native.The man’s chest and shoulders were magnificent, but the stump of a right arm, beyond the flesh of which the age-whitened bone projected several inches, attested the encounter with a shark that had put an end to his diving days and made him a fawner and an intriguer for small favors.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你听说了吗，亚历克？”他开口就这样说。“马普希捞到了一颗珍珠——很棒的一颗珍珠。别说在希库鲁岛，即使是在保莫塔群岛，在全世界，也从来没有捞到过这样的珍珠。买了它吧。如今还在他手上呢。记住我是头一个跟你说的。他是个傻瓜，你花低价钱就能弄到手。你有没有烟？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Have you heard, Alec?” were his first words.“Mapuhi has found a pearl—such a pearl.Never was there one like it ever fished up in Hikueru, nor in all the Paumotus, nor in all the world.Buy it from him.He has it now.And remember that I told you first.He is a fool and you can get it cheap.Have you any tobacco?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拉乌尔沿着海滩径直走向露兜树下的一间茅草屋。他是他母亲的货物管理员，他的工作就是到保莫塔群岛收购他们出手的椰子干、贝壳和珍珠。</td>
		<td class="en">Straight up the beach to a shack under a pandanus tree Raoul headed.He was his mother’s supercargo, and his business was to comb all the Paumotus for the wealth of copra, shell, and pearls that they yielded up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他是个年轻的货物管理员，这是他第二次出门办这种事，由于给珍珠估价的经验不足，他暗地里还是很担心的。不过，当马普希给他看那颗珍珠的时候，他还是设法克制住了内心的惊讶，脸上保持着一副生意人的漫不经心的表情。这颗珍珠使他一震。它像鸽子蛋一样大，珠圆润滑，乳白色的光反射着周围各种颜色。它真像是活的。他从没看到过这样的东西。当马普希把珍珠放到他手里的时候，它的分量也让他惊讶。这说明它是一颗上好的珍珠。他透过袖珍放大镜认认真真地把它查验了一遍。它没有任何瑕疵。它纯净得好像要脱离他的手掌，溶化到空气中了。在阴暗处，它发出柔和的光芒，就像月亮闪着柔光。它白得如此晶莹，当他把它放到一杯水中的时候，要想找到它可不容易。它很快沉入水底，所以，他知道他的分量不轻。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a young supercargo, it was his second voyage in such capacity, and he suffered much secret worry from his lack of experience in pricing pearls.But when Mapuhi exposed the pearl to his sight he managed to suppress the startle it gave him, and to maintain a careless, commercial expression on his face.For the pearl had struck him a blow.It was large as a pigeon egg, a perfect sphere, of a whiteness that reflected opalescent lights from all colors about it.It was alive.Never had he seen anything like it.When Mapuhi dropped it into his hand he was surprised by the weight of it.That showed that it was a good pearl.He examined it closely, through a pocket magnifying glass.It was without flaw or blemish.The purity of it seemed almost to melt into the atmosphere out of his hand.In the shade it was softly luminous, gleaming like a tender moon.So translucently white was it, that when he dropped it into a glass of water he had difficulty in finding it.So straight and swiftly had it sunk to the bottom that he knew its weight was excellent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，你想要什么来换呢？”他精心伪装，漫不经心地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, what do you want for it?” he asked, with a fine assumption of nonchalance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想要——”马普希开口了，在他身后，衬托着他那张黝黑的脸的是两个妇人和一个女孩子的黑脸，她们都点头表示赞同。她们的头都往前伸着，洋溢着被抑制住的渴望，眼睛里闪着贪婪的光。</td>
		<td class="en">“I want—” Mapuhi began, and behind him, framing his own dark face, the dark faces of two women and a girl nodded concurrence in what he wanted.Their heads were bent forward, they were animated by a suppressed eagerness, their eyes flashed avariciously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想要一座房子，”马普希接着说，“这房子得有一个白铁房顶和一个八角挂钟。它得够六英寻长，四周有一个走廊。房子正中间要有一个宽敞的房间，当中摆一张圆桌子，墙上挂上那个八角挂钟。一定要有四间卧室，在大房间的两侧各有两间，而且，每间卧室还要有一张铁床、两把椅子和一个盥洗盆。房子的后边要有间厨房，一间好厨房，要有盆，有锅，有炉子。还有，你必须把房子建在我们的法卡拉瓦岛上。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I want a house,” Mapuhi went on.“It must have a roof of galvanized iron and an octagon-drop-clock.It must be six fathoms long with a porch all around.A big room must be in the centre, with a round table in the middle of it and the octagon-drop-clock on the wall.There must be four bedrooms, two on each side of the big room, and in each bedroom must be an iron bed, two chairs, and a washstand.And back of the house must be a kitchen, a good kitchen, with pots and pans and a stove.And you must build the house on my island, which is Fakarava.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就这些吗？”拉乌尔怀疑地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is that all?”Raoul asked incredulously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还得有一台缝纫机。”马普希的妻子特法拉说。</td>
		<td class="en">“There must be a sewing machine,” spoke up Tefara, Mapuhi’s wife.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不要忘了那个八角挂钟。”马普希的妈妈瑙瑞又加了一句。</td>
		<td class="en">“Not forgetting the octagon-drop-clock,” added Nauri, Mapuhi’s mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，就这些了。”马普希说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, that is all,” said Mapuhi.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻的拉乌尔笑了。他痛快地笑了好一会儿。但是他一边笑，一边在心里默默盘算。他有生以来从没建过房子，他对建房子只有一个模糊不清的概念。他一边笑，一边计算着去塔希提岛置办材料的路费、材料本身的花费、返回法卡拉瓦岛的路费、把材料运到岸上以及建房子的花费。要是往宽裕里算的话，大概得四千法国银币——四千法国银币相当于两万法郎。这可行不通。他怎么知道这颗珍珠到底值多少钱？两万法郎可不是笔小数目——何况还是他母亲的钱。</td>
		<td class="en">Young Raoul laughed.He laughed long and heartily.But while he laughed he secretly performed problems in mental arithmetic.He had never built a house in his life, and his notions concerning house building were hazy.While he laughed, he calculated the cost of the voyage to Tahiti for materials, of the materials themselves, of the voyage back again to Fakarava, and the cost of landing the materials and of building the house.It would come to four thousand French dollars, allowing a margin for safety—four thousand French dollars were equivalent to twenty thousad francs.It was impossible.How was he to know the value of such a pearl?Twenty thousand francs was a lot of money—and of his mother’s money at that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“马普希，”他说，“你真是个大白痴。你开个价吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mapuhi,” he said, “you are a big fool.Set a money price.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是马普希摇了摇头，他身后的三个人也和他一起摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">But Mapuhi shook his head, and the three heads behind him shook with his.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想要房子，”他说，“这房子一定得有六英寻长，四周要有一个走廊……”</td>
		<td class="en">“I want the house,” he said.“It must be six fathoms long with a porch all around—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“行了，行了，”拉乌尔打断他说，“我知道你要什么样的房子，但是这样行不通。我准备付给你一千智利银币。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, yes,” Raoul interrupted.“I know all about your house, but it won’t do.I’ll give you a thousand Chili dollars.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >四个人默默地摇头，以示反对。</td>
		<td class="en">The four heads chorused a silent negative.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再加你一百智利银币。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And a hundred Chili dollars in trade.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就想要房子。”马普希开口道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I want the house,” Mapuhi began.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“房子到底有什么好？”拉乌尔问，“暴风一来就可以把它吹跑的。你该知道的。拉斐船长说好像很快要刮暴风了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What good will the house do you?”Raoul demanded.“The first hurricane that comes along will wash it away.You ought to know.Captain Raffy says it looks like a hurricane right now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“法卡拉瓦岛是不会刮的，”马普希说，“那里的地势要高得多。在这个岛上，是会刮起来的。任何一场暴风都可以席卷希库鲁岛。我要把房子建在法卡拉瓦岛上。房子一定得有六英寻长，四周得有一个走廊……”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not on Fakarava,” said Mapuhi.“The land is much higher there.On this island, yes.Any hurricane can sweep Hikueru.I will have the house on Fakarava.It must be six fathoms long with a porch all around—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，拉乌尔又听了一遍关于房子的叙述。他花了好几个小时，想尽法子来打消马普希心里关于房子的固执想法，但是马普希的母亲、老婆和他的女儿纳库拉，都支持他应该坚决要房子。正当拉乌尔听马普希第二十遍详细叙述他想要的房子的时候，他从敞开的门口看到，他的双桅船上的第二只小艇也靠岸了。水手们靠在桨上休息，说明想要赶快离开。“奥雷号”的大副跳到岸上，跟那个独臂的当地人说了句话，然后匆忙跑向拉乌尔。一阵暴风使得太阳被挡住了，天骤然间变暗了。拉乌尔往环礁湖那边望过去，看得出有暴风马上就要到来的迹象。</td>
		<td class="en">And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.Several hours he spent in the endeavor to hammer the house obsession out of Mapuhi’s mind; but Mapuhi’s mother and wife, and Ngakura, Mapuhi’s daughter, bolstered him in his resolve for the house.Through the open doorway, while he listened for the twentieth time to the detailed description of the house that was wanted, Raoul saw his schooner’s second boat draw up on the beach.The sailors rested on the oars, advertising haste to be gone.The first mate of the Aorai sprang ashore, exchanged a word with the one-armed native, then hurried toward Raoul.The day grew suddenly dark, as a squall obscured the face of the sun.Across the lagoon Raoul could see approaching the ominous line of the puff of wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“拉斐船长说，你必须马上离开这个该死的地方，”大副一见他就这么说，“要是这里有珠蚌什么的东西，我们也得等以后再来买——他是这么说的。气压计已经降到29.70了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Captain Raffy says you’ve got to get to hell outa here,” was the mate’s greeting.“If there’s any shell, we’ve got to run the risk of picking it up later on—so he says.The barometer’s dropped to twenty-nine-seventy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一阵狂风吹过他们头顶的露兜树，刮向远处的椰树，把五六个成熟的椰子重重地刮落到地上。然后，雨就从远处过来了，伴随着狂风的怒吼一路逼近，使泛起波纹的环礁湖水面涌起了雾气。当拉乌尔抬腿要跑的时候，头一阵雨点已经哗哗地砸到树叶上了。</td>
		<td class="en">The gust of wind struck the pandanus tree overhead and tore through the palms beyond, flinging half a dozen ripe cocoanuts with heavy thuds to the ground.Then came the rain out of the distance, advancing with the roar of a gale of wind and causing the water of the lagoon to smoke in driven windrows.The sharp rattle of the first drops was on the leaves when Raoul sprang to his feet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一千智利银币，现钱，马普希，”他说，“外加两百智利银币。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A thousand Chili dollars, cash down, Mapuhi,” he said.“And two hundred Chili dollars in trade.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想要一座房子……”对方又开始说了。</td>
		<td class="en">“I want a house—” the other began.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“马普希！”拉乌尔高声喊着，好让对方听到自己说什么，“你是一个白痴！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mapuhi!”Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.“You are a fool!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他冲出房子，跟大副肩并肩使劲向沙滩下边的小艇跑去。他们看不见那只小艇。热带的骤雨遮住了他们的四周，他们只能看见脚底下的沙滩和吞噬着沙滩的凶狠的环礁湖小浪。一个人影从暴雨中冒出来。是呼鲁－呼鲁，那个只有一只胳膊的人。</td>
		<td class="en">He flung out of the house, and, side by side with the mate, fought his way down the beach toward the boat.They could not see the boat.The tropic rain sheeted about them so that they could see only the beach under their feet and the spiteful little waves from the lagoon that snapped and bit at the sand.A figure appeared through the deluge.It was Huru-Huru, the man with the one arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“弄到那颗珍珠了吗？”他在拉乌尔耳边高声喊。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did you get the pearl?” he yelled in Raoul’s ear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“马普希是一个白痴！”他高声回答。下一刻，他们就在滂沱大雨中从彼此的视线里消失了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mapuhi is a fool!” was the answering yell, and the next moment they were lost to each other in the descending water.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >半个小时过后，呼鲁－呼鲁站在珊瑚岛对着海的一面观望，看见两只小艇被吊起来了，“奥雷号”驶向了大海的方向。他还看见，在它旁边，还有一艘双桅帆船乘着狂风的翅膀从海上驶来，它抛锚之后放下一只小艇。他认得这艘船。这是混血儿托里基的“奥洛亨纳号”。他是个生意人，自任货物管理员，无疑，如今他肯定在小艇的尾端。呼鲁－呼鲁轻声笑了起来。他知道马普希前一年还赊了托里基一批货，至今未还。</td>
		<td class="en">Half an hour later, Huru-Huru, watching from the seaward side of the atoll, saw the two boats hoisted in and the Aorai pointing her nose out to sea.And near her, just come in from the sea on the wings of the squall, he saw another schooner hove to and dropping a boat into the water.He knew her.It was the OROHENA, owned by Toriki, the half-caste trader, who served as his own supercargo and who doubtlessly was even then in the stern sheets of the boat.Huru-Huru chuckled.He knew that Mapuhi owed Toriki for trade goods advanced the year before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >暴风过去了。酷热的太阳光热辣辣地照射下来，环礁湖面又如明镜一般风平浪静了。但是空气黏得像树胶似的，沉甸甸的，好像压住了人的肺，让人难以呼吸。</td>
		<td class="en">The squall had passed.The hot sun was blazing down, and the lagoon was once more a mirror.But the air was sticky like mucilage, and the weight of it seemed to burden the lungs and make breathing difficult.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你听说这消息了吗，托里基？”呼鲁－呼鲁问。“马普希捞到了一颗珍珠。别说是在希库鲁，即使在保莫塔群岛的什么地方，甚至世界上随便什么地方，也从没有人捞到过这样的珍珠。马普希是个白痴。何况他还欠你钱呢。记得是我头一个告诉你的。你有烟吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Have you heard the news, Toriki?”Huru-Huru asked.“Mapuhi has found a pearl.Never was there a pearl like it ever fished up in Hikueru, nor anywhere in the Paumotus, nor anywhere in all the world.Mapuhi is a fool.Besides, he owes you money.Remember that I told you first.Have you any tobacco?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >托里基向马普希的茅草屋走去。他很专横，而且非常愚蠢。他漫不经心地瞅了瞅那颗奇妙的珍珠——只瞅了一眼；然后便毫不在乎地把它装进衣兜里。</td>
		<td class="en">And to the grass shack of Mapuhi went Toriki.He was a masterful man, withal a fairly stupid one.Carelessly he glanced at the wonderful pearl—glanced for a moment only; and carelessly he dropped it into his pocket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真幸运，”他说，“这真是颗好珍珠。我可以给你划一笔账。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are lucky,” he said.“It is a nice pearl.I will give you credit on the books.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想要一座房子，”马普希有点惊愕地开口说，“要有六英寻……”</td>
		<td class="en">“I want a house,” Mapuhi began, in consternation.“It must be six fathoms—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“六英寻你奶奶！”那个生意人反驳道。“你得还你欠下的钱，这才是你要的。你欠我一千两百智利银币。很好；如今就当你不欠我的了。咱们的账就算结清了。另外，我再给你记上两百智利银币的账。如果我去了塔希提，珠子能卖个好价钱，我就再给你记一百银币的账——这样总共是三百银币。但是，你得记住，只能是在珠子能卖个好价钱的情况下。没准我连本都赚不回来呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Six fathoms your grandmother!” was the trader’s retort.“You want to pay up your debts, that’s what you want.You owed me twelve hundred dollars Chili.Very well; you owe them no longer.The amount is squared.Besides, I will give you credit for two hundred Chili.If, when I get to Tahiti, the pearl sells well, I will give you credit for another hundred—that will make three hundred.But mind, only if the pearl sells well.I may even lose money on it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马普希难过地交叉双臂，垂着头坐着。他的珍珠被抢了。他没得到房子，只还了一笔债。珍珠没了，什么都没看到。</td>
		<td class="en">Mapuhi folded his arms in sorrow and sat with bowed head.He had been robbed of his pearl.In place of the house, he had paid a debt.There was nothing to show for the pearl.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真是个白痴。”特法拉说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You are a fool,” said Tefara.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真是个白痴，”他母亲瑙瑞说，“你为什么把珍珠给了他呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are a fool,” said Nauri, his mother.“Why did you let the pearl into his hand?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我能怎么办呢？”马普希反驳道，“我欠着他的钱呢。他知道我有这颗珍珠。你也听到了，是他自己要看的。我可没告诉他。他已经知道了。别人告诉他了。而且我还欠着他的钱。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What was I to do?”Mapuhi protested.“I owed him the money.He knew I had the pearl.You heard him yourself ask to see it.I had not told him.He knew.Somebody else told him.And I owed him the money.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“马普希是个白痴。”纳库拉也学着说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mapuhi is a fool,” mimicked Ngakura.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她才十二岁，还不明白事理。马普希终于找到一个出气的机会，一个耳光打得她直摇晃；特法拉和瑙瑞放声痛哭，接着用女人们的那一套训斥他。</td>
		<td class="en">She was twelve years old and did not know any better.Mapuhi relieved his feelings by sending her reeling from a box on the ear; while Tefara and Nauri burst into tears and continued to upbraid him after the manner of women.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在沙滩上，呼鲁－呼鲁又看见一艘他认识的双桅帆船停在环礁湖口，放下一只小艇。是“希拉号”，这名字起得很棒，因为它的主人是莱维，这个德国籍的犹太人是最大的珍珠商，而且，众所周知，希拉是塔希提渔夫和小偷的庇护神。</td>
		<td class="en">Huru-Huru, watching on the beach, saw a third schooner that he knew heave to outside the entrance and drop a boat.It was the Hira, well named, for she was owned by Levy, the German Jew, the greatest pearl buyer of them all, and, as was well known, Hira was the Tahitian god of fishermen and thieves.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你听说这消息了吗？”那个胖乎乎的、五官不正的莱维刚一上岸，呼鲁－呼鲁就问，“马普希捞到一颗珍珠。别说是在希库鲁，即便在保莫塔群岛，甚至在全世界，也没捞过这么好的珍珠。马普希是一个白痴。他已经一千四百智利银币卖给了托里基——我在外边听他们谈话时听到的。托里基也同样是一个白痴。你可以从他那里低价买过来。记住，是我头一个跟你说的。你有烟吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Have you heard the news?”Huru-Huru asked, as Levy, a fat man with massive asymmetrical features, stepped out upon the beach.“Mapuhi has found a pearl.There was never a pearl like it in Hikueru, in all the Paumotus, in all the world.Mapuhi is a fool.He has sold it to Toriki for fourteen hundred Chili—I listened outside and heard.Toriki is likewise a fool.You can buy it from him cheap.Remember that I told you first.Have you any tobacco?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“托里基在哪？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Where is Toriki?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在林奇船长家喝苦艾酒呢。他已经在那儿呆了一个小时了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“In the house of Captain Lynch, drinking absinthe.He has been there an hour.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >莱维和托里基喝着苦艾酒，关于那颗珍珠讨价还价的时候，呼鲁－呼鲁听到了他们用两万五千法郎的骇人高价谈妥了这笔买卖。</td>
		<td class="en">And while Levy and Toriki drank absinthe and chaffered over the pearl, Huru-Huru listened and heard the stupendous price of twenty-five thousand francs agreed upon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正当这个时候，正朝海岸靠近的“奥洛亨纳号”和“希拉号”突然发了疯似的开始打响了信号枪。那三个人跑出去的时候，刚好看见那两艘双桅帆船匆忙掉头驶离了海岸，同时降下主帆和船首的三角帆，顶着使船身倾斜的狂风，朝白浪漫天的大海疾速驶去。之后，它们便消失在大雨中。</td>
		<td class="en">It was at this time that both the OROHENA and the Hira, running in close to the shore, began firing guns and signalling frantically.The three men stepped outside in time to see the two schooners go hastily about and head off shore, dropping mainsails and flying jibs on the run in the teeth of the squall that heeled them far over on the whitened water.Then the rain blotted them out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“风暴停了它们会回来的，”托里基说道，“我们还是离开这里吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They’ll be back after it’s over,” said Toriki.“We’d better be getting out of here.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我猜，气压计又降了一些。”林奇船长说。</td>

		<td class="en">But she did not have any time to waste on him.Whether she swam or not, the current drew away from the land just the same.A half hour went by, and the shark began to grow bolder.Seeing no harm in her he drew closer, in narrowing circles, cocking his eyes at her impudently as he slid past.Sooner or later, she knew well enough, he would get up sufficient courage to dash at her.She resolved to play first.It was a desperate act she meditated.She was an old woman, alone in the sea and weak from starvation and hardship; and yet she, in the face of this sea tiger, must anticipate his dash by herself dashing at him.She swam on, waiting her chance.At last he passed languidly by, barely eight feet away.She rushed at him suddenly, feigning that she was attacking him.He gave a wild flirt of his tail as he fled away, and his sandpaper hide, striking her, took off her skin from elbow to shoulder.He swam rapidly, in a widening circle, and at last disappeared.</td></tr>
