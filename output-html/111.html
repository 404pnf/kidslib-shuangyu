		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >前一天晚上的研讨会太让我伤神了。我头痛欲裂，而且极度困倦。原本晚上我打算出去的。不过我想更明智的做法是吃口晚饭，然后立刻上床睡觉。</td>
		<td class="en">THE SYMPOSIUM of the preceding evening had been a little too much for my nerves.I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然晚饭要清淡一点。我非常喜欢威尔士奶酪。但是，一次吃一磅多不是什么时候都可以的。不过，要是两磅的话我的肠胃也不会反对的。说实在的，两磅和三磅的区别只是数字不同而已。也许我还冒险吃过四磅。我妻子说我吃了五磅——但是，显然她把两件截然不同的事搞混了。五这个抽象数字，我是愿意承认的，但是它具体指的是黑啤酒的瓶数。没有这种酒做调味，我是咽不下威尔士奶酪的。</td>
		<td class="en">A light supper of course.I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit.More than a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable.Still, there can be no material objection to two.And really between two and three, there is merely a single unit of difference.I ventured, perhaps, upon four.My wife will have it five;—but, clearly, she has confounded two very distinct affairs.The abstract number, five, I am willing to admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout, without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吃完这顿便饭之后，我戴上睡帽，静静地盼望能够一觉睡到第二天中午。我把头枕在枕头上，心情极好，很快就沉沉地睡着了。</td>
		<td class="en">Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a profound slumber forthwith.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，人类的愿望什么时候实现过呢？我还没打完第三个呼噜，大门的门铃就猛烈地响了起来，接着便是急促的敲门声，立刻就把我惊醒了。一分钟之后，当我还在揉眼睛的时候，我的妻子把一张便条塞到了我眼前，原来是我的老朋友波诺纳医生留的。内容是这样的：</td>
		<td class="en">But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled?I could not have completed my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once.In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner.It ran thus:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当您收到便条时，无论如何尽快到我这里来，我亲爱的好朋友。来和我们共同感受喜悦。经过长时间的不懈交涉，我终于得到了市博物馆馆长的许可，对那具木乃伊进行检验——您知道我指的是哪一具。我得到了打开裹尸布的许可，如果需要的话还可以剖开尸体。只有几个朋友会在场——当然包括您。木乃伊现在就在我家里，我们将在今晚十一点打开裹尸布。</td>
		<td class="en">Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive this.Come and help us to rejoice.At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination of the Mummy—you know the one I mean.I have permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable.A few friends only will be present—you, of course.The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >您永远的朋友，波诺纳。</td>
		<td class="en">Yours, ever, PONNONNER.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当我读到“波诺纳”时，我意识到自己彻底清醒了，像正常人一样。我兴奋极了，从床上一跃而起，把所有碍事的东西都扔到一边，用惊人的速度穿好衣服，飞一般地出发去医生家。</td>
		<td class="en">By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was as wide awake as a man need be.I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我发现医生家已经聚集了一群迫不及待的人。他们已经等我等得不耐烦了，木乃伊被平放在餐桌上，我一到他们就开始做检验了。</td>
		<td class="en">There I found a very eager company assembled.They had been awaiting me with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and the moment I entered its examination was commenced.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这具木乃伊是波诺纳医生的一个堂兄阿瑟·萨布里塔什上尉前些年带来的两具木乃伊中的一具，是从埃雷西亚附近的一个墓穴中带来的，埃雷西亚在距尼罗河上游的底比斯比较远的利比亚山区。虽然这个地区的洞穴没有底比斯石墓那样宏大，但是由于它保有大量绘着古埃及人个人生活的壁画，因此人们对这个墓穴更感兴趣。据说陈放我们这具木乃伊的那个墓穴有大量这种壁画，墙壁完全被湿壁画和浅浮雕覆盖了，雕像、瓶饰和各种图案的镶嵌作品都显示着死者的巨大财富。</td>
		<td class="en">It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians.The chamber from which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such illustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这具木乃伊先前一直是存放在博物馆中的，和萨布里塔什上尉发现它时的状态丝毫不差——也就是说，这个棺材是未被动过的。八年来木乃伊就这么站着，仅将它的外部呈现在公众眼前。所以，现在供我们支配的是整具木乃伊。要知道，未遭洗劫的古物到达我们海岸是非常罕见的。显然，那些意识到这种罕见性的人们，会立刻明白我们有充分的理由为我们的好运感到高兴。</td>
		<td class="en">The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;—that is to say, the coffin had not been disturbed.For eight years it had thus stood, subject only externally to public inspection.We had now, therefore, the complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我走到桌旁，看见桌上有一个大盒子，或者说是箱子，将近七英尺长，大概三英尺宽，两英尺半深。盒子是长方形的——不是棺材形。我们起先以为盒子的材料是悬铃木，但是刀切进去时发现材料是硬纸板，或者更确切地说是用纸莎草做的纸浆板。盒子上密密地绘着表现丧葬场景和其他悲伤主题的饰画——其间在不同位置点缀着同一组象形文字，无疑暗含了已故者的名字。幸运的是，格利登先生是我们团队中的一员，他可以轻而易举地翻译这些字母。这些字母只是音标字母，代表“奥拉米斯泰鸠”这个词。</td>
		<td class="en">Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep.It was oblong—not coffin-shaped.The material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore (platanus), but, upon cutting into it, we found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, papier mache, composed of papyrus.It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects—interspersed among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed.By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the word Allamistakeo.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >既打开盒子但又不损坏盒子并不容易，但是当我们最终完成任务时，却看到了第二个盒子，它是棺材形的，在尺寸上要比外面那层小很多，但在其他方面都和外层非常相似。两个盒子之间塞满了树脂，在一定程度上磨损了内层盒子的颜色。</td>
		<td class="en">We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second, coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one, but resembling it precisely in every other respect.The interval between the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the colors of the interior box.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >打开第二个盒子后（这次很轻松），我们看到了第三个盒子，也是棺材形的，除了用料是雪松外，与第二个盒子并无二致，依旧散发着浓烈奇特的雪松的香味。第二个盒子和第三个盒子之间没有空隙——两个盒子精准地套嵌在一起。</td>
		<td class="en">Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood.Between the second and the third case there was no interval—the one fitting accurately within the other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >移走第三个盒子，我们发现了木乃伊并将它取了出来。我们原本以为这具木乃伊会像往常一样，被绷带或亚麻布条缠得一圈又一圈。但我们发现的却是一种由纸莎草制成的护套，护套外面涂有一层石膏，石膏表面厚厚地镀了金并且绘满了图画。绘画表现了死者灵魂应该履行的各种义务和灵魂参见不同神灵的情景，画面上同一人物多次出现，很可能是被制成木乃伊的那个人的肖像。护套从头到脚有一条纵向或垂直书写的铭文，又一次用语音象形文字写着被制成木乃伊的这个人的名字和头衔，以及他的亲属的名字和头衔。</td>
		<td class="en">Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.We had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath, made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and painted.The paintings represented subjects connected with the various supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as portraits of the persons embalmed.Extending from head to foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在其颈部周围将护套打开，露出一个由各色圆柱形玻璃珠串成的项圈，塑成神明、圣甲虫等图形，还有一个带翅膀的圆球。腰部围的是与之相类似的圈饰或腰带。</td>
		<td class="en">Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe.Around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除去纸莎草，我们发现肉体保存完好，没有明显的异味。肤色微红。皮肤紧实、平滑并且富有光泽。牙齿和头发也都保存完好。眼珠（似乎）已被除去，并用玻璃取代，除了眼睛异常坚定地凝视着某处之外，看起来异常美丽逼真。手指和指甲都镀了金，闪闪发亮。</td>
		<td class="en">Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation, with no perceptible odor.The color was reddish.The skin was hard, smooth, and glossy.The teeth and hair were in good condition.The eyes (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too determined a stare.The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >根据表皮发红这一现象，格利登先生认为是用柏油做的防腐处理。但是我们用钢制工具在木乃伊表皮刮下粉末状物质再投入火中之后，闻到的显然是樟脑和其他香味树脂的气味。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums became apparent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们非常仔细地搜查了尸体，想找到取出内脏时留下的切口，但令人吃惊的是，我们一个都没找到。当时我们中间谁也不知道完整的、未被打开的木乃伊并不罕见。惯用的做法是通过鼻子吸出大脑，在身体的侧面做切口取出内脏，然后对身体做修刮、清洗和腌制处理，放置几星期后开始进行防腐处理——这是恰当的说法。</td>
		<td class="en">We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met.The brain it was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于没有发现打开过的痕迹，波诺纳医生开始准备解剖工具，此时我注意到已经是凌晨两点多了。于是大家同意将内脏检验推迟到第二天晚上。我们正要离开，这时有人提议用伏打电堆做一两个实验。</td>
		<td class="en">As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two o’clock.Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对一具至少三四千年的木乃伊使用电流，这个想法即使不十分高明，也够有创意的，因此立即获得我们的一致赞同。我们抱着一分认真、九分玩笑的态度在医生书房里安好电池，就把埃及人抬了进去。</td>
		<td class="en">The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original, and we all caught it at once.About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and conveyed thither the Egyptian.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们费了好大的劲才使尸体太阳穴位置的几处肌肉暴露出来，它们看起来没有尸体的其他部位那样僵硬，但是正如我们料想的那样，在接通电流后，肌肉没有抽搐的迹象。这第一次实验，看起来结果是确定无疑了。我们为自己的荒唐行为大笑了一通，彼此道了晚安。这时我的目光不经意地落在木乃伊的眼睛上，顿时感到惊愕万分。事实上，虽然是短暂的一瞥，但这足以让我确信，我们所有人认为的玻璃做的眼球，原本明显是死死地凝视着什么的，现在却被眼皮盖上了，只能看到一小部分白膜。</td>
		<td class="en">It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with the wire.This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement.My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea remained visible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我大叫一声让大家都来看我的发现，很快，所有人都发现了这个事实。</td>
		<td class="en">With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately obvious to all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我不能说我对眼前的事情感到惊恐，因为“惊恐”这个词在这种情况下，不是很准确。但是，要不是黑啤酒，我可能也会有点紧张的。至于其他同伴，他们根本不去掩饰自己的极度恐惧。波诺纳医生的样子真是让人可怜。格利登先生以某种神秘的方式消失得不见踪影。我想西尔克·白金汉先生绝不敢否认自己手脚并用地爬到了桌子下面。</td>
		<td class="en">I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is, in my case, not exactly the word.It is possible, however, that, but for the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous.As for the rest of the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright fright which possessed them.Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.Mr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible.Mr. Silk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his way, upon all fours, under the table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而在第一阵惊吓过去之后，我们决定立即做进一步实验。这次我们直接对木乃伊的右脚大脚趾进行解剖。我们在大脚趾籽骨外侧做了个切口，使外展肌的根部露出来。我们重新调整了电池，将电流接在了切口处的神经上——这时，木乃伊像活了一样运动起来，先是右膝向上一提，几乎碰到腹部，然后以惊人的力量猛地伸直，踢了波诺纳医生一脚，只见那位绅士像离弦的箭一样穿过窗户，飞向下面的街道。</td>
		<td class="en">After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter of course, upon further experiment forthwith.Our operations were now directed against the great toe of the right foot.We made an incision over the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis, and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle.Readjusting the battery, we now applied the fluid to the bisected nerves—when, with a movement of exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner, which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a catapult, through a window into the street below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们全体冲了出去，打算捡回遇难者的断肢残臂，却惊喜地在楼梯上遇到了波诺纳医生，他正火急火燎地往楼梯上爬，洋溢着强烈的求知欲，比之前更加坚定了全身心投入实验的决心。</td>
		<td class="en">We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with vigor and with zeal.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >根据波诺纳医生的建议，我们当场在木乃伊的鼻子顶端做了一个深入的切口，而医生自己则一把揪住木乃伊的鼻子，粗暴地接通了电流。</td>
		<td class="en">It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor himself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the wire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >无论从精神上来说还是从身体上来说——从比喻意义上来说还是从字面意义上来说——效果都是令人震惊的。首先，木乃伊睁开了眼睛，飞快地眨了几分钟，正像巴恩斯先生表演哑剧那样；然后，他打了个喷嚏；之后，他坐了起来；再之后，他在波诺纳医生面前晃了晃拳头；最后，他转向格利登先生和白金汉先生，用纯正的埃及语说道：　</td>
		<td class="en">Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—was the effect electric.In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital Egyptian, thus:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不得不说，先生们，你们的行为让我既惊讶又耻辱。对于波诺纳医生，他的行为并不让我感到意外。他是个又矮又胖、可怜无知的蠢蛋。我同情并且原谅他。但是您，格利登先生——还有您，西尔克——你们长期去埃及旅行，到那里居住，人们都以为你们是当地人——你们在我们中间生活了那么久，我想你们说埃及语就像你们写自己的母语一样流畅——我一直视你们为木乃伊们真诚的朋友——我原以为你们会表现得更加绅士。你们安静地站在一边，眼睁睁地看着我受这样无礼的待遇，我应该怎么想呢？你们允许阿猫阿狗在这样寒冷的天气里把我从棺材里拽出来，剥掉我的衣服，我应该怎么想呢？你们帮助还教唆那个无耻的小恶棍波诺纳医生揪我的鼻子，这我又该怎么想呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at your behaviour.Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected.He is a poor little fat fool who knows no better.I pity and forgive him.But you, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have travelled and resided in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born—you, I say who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I have always been led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies—I really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you.What am I to think of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used?What am I to suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate?In what light (to come to the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >毫无疑问，人们想当然认为，我们在这样的情况下听到这番话，要么夺门而逃，要么疯狂得歇斯底里，要么全体昏厥。要我说，三种情况必定有一种情况发生。事实上三种情况中的任何一种或这三种情况都十分有可能发生。并且我确实不知道我们是如何又为何没有采取三种情况中的一种的。但是也许可以到我们这个时代的精神里去寻找真正的原因，这种时代精神是按照相反的规律发展的，而且现在通常约定俗成地用来解决关于自相矛盾和不可能的事情。或许是由于木乃伊那种理所当然、不容辩驳的口气，他的话听起来并不令人毛骨悚然。无论出于何种原因，事实很清楚，我们中没有一个人显现出异常惊恐的神情，或者似乎并不认为刚才发生的事有特别不对劲的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon.One of these three things was, I say, to be expected.Indeed each and all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued.And, upon my word, I am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other.But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and impossibility.Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就我个人而言，我确信一切都还正常，只是退到了埃及人拳头袭击范围以外的地方。波诺纳医生手插裤兜，怒视着木乃伊，脸涨得通红。格利登先生摸了摸胡子，向上立起了衬衫衣领。白金汉先生低垂着头，把右手大拇指塞进了左边的嘴角里。</td>
		<td class="en">For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside, out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist.Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively red in the face.Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt.Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃及人表情严肃地盯了白金汉先生几分钟，冷笑了一声，说：</td>
		<td class="en">The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and at length, with a sneer, said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您为什么不说话，白金汉先生？您听到我问您话了没有？把大拇指从嘴巴里拿出来！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham?Did you hear what I asked you, or not?Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听了此话，白金汉先生微微一震，把他的右手大拇指从左嘴角里拿了出来。作为补偿，又把左手的大拇指塞进了右嘴角里。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没有得到白金汉先生的回应，木乃伊又怒气腾腾地转向格利登先生，专横地质问我们所有人这么做是什么意思。</td>
		<td class="en">Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格利登先生发出一长串的音标字母来回答他。要不是美国印刷所缺少象形文字的铅字，我是非常愿意将他精彩演说的原文记录下来的。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his very excellent speech.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我也借此机会说明一下，以下只要有木乃伊参与的对话用的都是古埃及语，通过译者格利登先生和白金汉先生（对于我和其他没去埃及游历过的人来说）翻译过来的。这两位先生把木乃伊的母语说得极为流利优雅。但是我忍不住要说（毫无疑问，因为需要对这个没有接触过的人介绍一些完全现代和新鲜的意象），这两位旅行家有时为了说明某个特定的含义，会用一些直观的方法来降低表达的难度。例如，格利登先生一时间无法让这个埃及人理解“政治”这个词，于是他用木炭在墙上画了一个长着酒糟鼻的小个子绅士。这位绅士衣衫褴褛，站在一个树桩上，左腿后缩，右手紧握拳头向前掷去，两眼望天，嘴巴张开九十度角。同样，白金汉先生解释不清“假发”这个现代概念，最后（在波诺纳医生的建议下）他脸色惨白地同意摘下自己头上的假发。</td>
		<td class="en">I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company)—through the medium, I say, of Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters.These gentlemen spoke the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger) the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.Mr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees.Just in the same way Mr. Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and consented to take off his own.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended.Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在我们注意到，伯爵（这似乎是奥拉米斯泰鸠的头衔）轻微地打了个寒颤——他无疑是受凉了。医生立即奔向他的衣柜，很快拿来一件黑色礼服，是詹宁斯服装店的最佳款式，一条天蓝色格子吊带裤，一件粉红色格子衬衣，一件翻边锦缎背心，一件白色宽松大衣，一根弯头手杖，一顶无檐帽，一双黑漆皮靴，一副淡黄色羔皮手套，一副眼镜，一对胡须和一个瀑布式领结。由于伯爵和医生身材不同（比例大概为二比一），埃及人在穿这些衣服时遇到了一些困难，但一切都弄好之后，他可以说是穿戴整齐了。于是格利登先生让木乃伊挽着自己的手臂，把他领到火炉边一个舒适的椅子旁，医生则立即拉响了铃铛，要了雪茄和葡萄酒。</td>
		<td class="en">It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold.The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat.Owing to the disparity of size between the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be dressed.Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“With great pleasure,” he said.“The usual duration of man’s life, in my time, was about eight hundred years.Few men died, unless by most extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments.In the case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this kind was indispensable.An historian, for example, having attained the age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—say five or six hundred years.Resuming existence at the expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of hap-hazard note-book—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.These guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book.When discovered, it was never worth the trouble of the search.After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived.Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification, pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes.He recollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height.The palace itself (as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been altogether about seven in circuit.Its walls were richly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics.He would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble.That palace at Carnac was an insignificant little building after all.He (the Count), however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the Doctor.Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我问伯爵对我们的铁路有什么看法。</td>
		<td class="en">I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没什么看法，”伯爵回答，“没什么特别之处。”构造相当脆弱，设计拙劣，铺设粗糙。当然无法和我们宽阔平直、装有铁槽的砌道相比。埃及人能通过砌道运输整座寺庙和高达一百五十英尺的坚固的方尖石塔。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.”They were rather slight, rather ill-conceived, and clumsily put together.They could not be compared, of course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我又说到我们巨大的机械动力。</td>
		<td class="en">I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伯爵承认我们在这方面有一定的知识，但反问我怎样把像卡纳克这样的小宫殿的柱头放到门楣上去。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于这个问题我决定装没听见，继续问伯爵是否知道自流井，然而他只是扬了扬眉毛。格利登先生拼命向我使眼色，低声对我说，受雇在大绿洲打井的工程师们最近刚发现了一口埃及自流井。</td>
		<td class="en">This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后我又提到我们的钢铁，但是这个外国人翘起鼻子问我，我们的钢是否能刻出方尖石塔上那样鲜明的雕刻，这些雕刻都是用铜制利器刻出来的。</td>
		<td class="en">I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个问题一下子使我们变得惊慌失措，于是我们认为还是转而谈论玄学为好。我们派人去取了一本《日晷》，读了里面的一两章，内容表达得不是很清楚，总之是关于波士顿人所谓的“伟大的进步运动”的。</td>
		<td class="en">This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to Metaphysics.We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伯爵只说“伟大的运动”在他的那个时代是十分平常的事，至于进步，确实有段时间使人困扰，但是从未得到好转。</td>
		<td class="en">The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it never progressed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后我们谈到了民主的优点和重要意义。不过，在让伯爵准确感受生活在没有君主、可以自由投票的时代的好处时，我们遇到了很大的困难。</td>
		<td class="en">We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伯爵兴趣盎然地听着，并且似乎感觉非常愉快。我们说完后，伯爵告诉我们，很久以前曾经发生过类似的事件。埃及十三个州突然决定独立，也为其他人类树立一个光辉的榜样。他们组织智者召开会议，制定出构思独特的宪法。他们一度搞得有声有色，不过那也只是他们的吹牛功夫好。然而结局却是这十三个州和其他十五个或二十个州合并，且采用了世上最臭名昭著和令人难以忍受的专制制度。</td>
		<td class="en">He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred something of a very similar sort.Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of mankind.They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive.For a while they managed remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.The thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我问那个篡权的暴君的名字是什么。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我无话可说，只得提高嗓门，为埃及人不知道蒸汽机表示惋惜。</td>
		<td class="en">Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the Egyptian ignorance of steam.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伯爵非常吃惊地看着我，但是什么也没说。又是那位沉默的先生用胳膊肘狠狠地捅了一下我的肋骨——告诉我这次我可真是出尽了洋相——问我是否真的如此愚蠢，竟不知现代蒸汽机是所罗门·德考司从希罗的发明中得到的启发。</td>
		<td class="en">The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer.The silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows—told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们眼看就要陷入窘境，幸好，波诺纳医生重新振作起来，为我们解了围。他问埃及人的盛装能否与现代人一比高低。</td>
		<td class="en">We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue, and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the all-important particular of dress.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听了这话，伯爵低头瞥了一眼他裤子上的吊带，然后捏住衣服的一片后摆，举到眼前端详了几分钟。最后伯爵放下后摆，他的嘴渐渐地咧开，越开越大。但是我不记得他做了任何回答。</td>
		<td class="en">The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some minutes.Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是我们重新打起精神，医生庄重地靠近木乃伊，希望他以一名绅士的名誉坦率地回答，埃及人——在任何时期——是否掌握了制作波诺纳的药液或是布兰德雷思的药片的方法。</td>
		<td class="en">Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the manufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们急切地等待着回答——但是却徒然无获。不会有回答了。埃及人脸涨得通红，耷拉着脑袋。从未有过比这更完美的胜利了，也没有比这更耻辱的失败了。我无法忍受看到可怜的木乃伊受屈辱的样子。我拿起帽子，僵硬地向他鞠了一躬，便告辞出来了。</td>
		<td class="en">We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer—but in vain.It was not forthcoming.The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head.Never was triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s mortification.I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到家时我发现已经是凌晨四点多了，于是立刻上床睡觉。现在是上午十点。我七点就起床了，为了家人和全人类的利益记下这些笔录。我不会再见到我的家人。我的妻子是个泼妇。事实上，我对这种生活和整个十九世纪都感到极度厌倦。我承认所有的事情都乱了套。此外，我很想知道2045年的总统会是哪位。所以，等我刮好胡子，喝完咖啡，我就直奔波诺纳医生那里，让他把我制成木乃伊，沉睡一两百年。</td>
		<td class="en">Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to bed.It is now ten A.M.I have been up since seven, penning these memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind.The former I shall behold no more.My wife is a shrew.The truth is, I am heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general.I am convinced that every thing is going wrong.Besides, I am anxious to know who will be President in 2045.As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years.</td></tr>
