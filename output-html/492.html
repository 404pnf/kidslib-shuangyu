		<td class="en">可是令王子如此着迷的这位公主却长着一个俊俏的小鼻子，这可能是她脸上最漂亮的地方。侍臣们已经养成了一种习惯，时常想也不想就嘲笑起公主的小鼻子，这可让他们烦恼了一阵。他们可不敢当着王子的面这么做，因为王子可不觉得这有什么好笑的。实际上，王子还放逐了对可爱小公主小巧鼻子出言不逊的两位大臣。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they spoke, and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose, still, a woman’s beauty was a different thing; and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a “tip-tilted” nose!</td>
		<td class="en">受到了这样的警告，其他的大臣都学会了想好了再开口。有位大臣甚至告诉王子，虽然一个男人没有大鼻子就一无是处，但是女人的美是不同的。他就认识一位了解古希腊历史的博学之士，他在一些古老的手抄本里读到过：美丽的克里奥佩特拉本人也有一个向上翘的小鼻子。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">公主的父王同意了这门婚事。海辛斯王子急着见到公主，走了三里格终于见到了她。他刚要上前亲吻公主的手，令在场的人不寒而栗的事情就发生了，巫师像闪电一般倏然出现了，一把抓住公主把她卷走了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The Prince was left quite unconsolable, and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again, and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his horse and rode sadly away, letting the animal choose his own path.</td>
		<td class="en">王子伤心欲绝，发誓在找到公主之前绝不回自己的王国。拒绝了大臣们的随扈，他骑上马伤心地走了，任由马儿自己选择道路。</td></tr>
