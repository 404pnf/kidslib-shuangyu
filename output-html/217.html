		<td class="en">CHAPTER I</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那人拿一把弹簧钥匙开了门，然后走了进来，后面跟着一个小伙子。这小伙子笨拙地脱下了便帽。他穿的粗布衣服带着海洋的咸味，发现自己身处这宽敞的大厅，他明显感到很拘束。他不知道该怎么处置自己的帽子，正要塞进外套口袋时，另外那个人便接了过去。那人的动作是如此自然且不露声色，笨拙的小伙子不禁对此充满感激。“他了解我。”他心想。“他定会帮我度过这一切的。”</td>
		<td class="en">The one opened the door with a latch-key and went in, followed by a young fellow who awkwardly removed his cap.He wore rough clothes that smacked of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which he found himself.He did not know what to do with his cap, and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it from him.The act was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward young fellow appreciated it.“He understands,” was his thought.“He’ll see me through all right.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他紧跟在那人身后走着，摇晃着肩膀，双腿不自觉地张开，似乎那平坦的地板正随着海浪左右倾斜、上下颠簸。宽大的房间对他晃动的脚步来说似乎还是太窄了，而他自己也很紧张，唯恐自己宽阔的肩膀会撞上门框或是把低矮的壁炉架上的小摆设给扫到地上。他在各种物件之间闪来闪去，而那让那原本存在于他心里的恐惧感又成倍地增加了。一架大钢琴和屋子正中一张堆满书籍的桌子之间的空间可供六个人并行通过，但他却走得提心吊胆。他的胳膊十分沉重，松松地挂在身体两侧。他不知该拿自己的胳膊和双手怎么办，突然紧张地发现一条胳膊似乎快要撞到桌上的书了，于是像一匹受惊的马一般向旁边一个趔趄，几乎碰翻琴凳。他看着走在前面那人轻松的步伐，第一次意识到自己走路与别人不同。想到自己走路如此笨拙，他顿时感到难堪。细小的汗珠渗出他的前额，他停下来用手帕擦了擦他古铜色的脸。</td>
		<td class="en">He walked at the other’s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his legs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea.The wide rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric-a-brac from the low mantel.He recoiled from side to side between the various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind.Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed it with trepidation.His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides.He did not know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited vision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table, he lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano stool.He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other men.He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly.The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“等一下，阿瑟老兄。”他说道，想用句玩笑话来掩饰自己的紧张。“这一切对你家人来说确实太突然了。”让我先定定神。你知道我不想来的，我想你家人也未必想要见我。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hold on, Arthur, my boy,” he said, attempting to mask his anxiety with facetious utterance.“This is too much all at once for yours truly.Give me a chance to get my nerve.You know I didn’t want to come, an’ I guess your fam’ly ain’t hankerin’ to see me neither.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没事的，”阿瑟安慰道，“千万别被我家人吓到。我们只是普普通通的人——嘿，这儿还有一封我的信呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s all right,” was the reassuring answer.“You mustn’t be frightened at us.We’re just homely people—Hello, there’s a letter for me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他走回桌边，拆开信封看了起来，正好让这个客人有机会镇定一下。客人心里明白，也很感激。同情人、理解人是他的天赋；眼下，在他警觉的外表下，理解他人的机制仍在运转。他擦干了额头的汗珠，摆出平静的样子环视四周，但眼里却藏不住那种野兽害怕陷阱时露出的神色。他身处从未见过的事物之中，担心会发生什么，却又不知道自己该做什么，意识到自己的步伐和举止十分笨拙，害怕自己所有的特性和能力也会受到类似的折磨。他极度敏感，自我意识强烈得不可救药，而那人偏又越过信纸用饶有兴致的眼神偷偷打量他，那眼神如匕首般深深刺痛了他。他瞧见了那眼神，却不动声色，因为在他学到的本领中有一样叫做克制。那“匕首”同样伤到了他的自尊。他咒骂自己不该来，但同时也下定决心，不管发生什么，既然来了就一定要坚持下去。他脸部的线条变得僵硬，眼中闪现出一种拼搏的光芒。他更加满不在乎地打量起四周，目光敏锐，头脑中记录下了这华丽厅堂里的每一个细节。他双眼圆睁；目光所及之处，丝毫不漏；随着双眼痛饮着室内的美景，那拼搏的光渐渐变弱，最终被温暖的光所取代。他对美敏感，眼前的便是令他敏感的事物。</td>
		<td class="en">He stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to read, giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself.And the stranger understood and appreciated.His was the gift of sympathy, understanding; and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic process went on.He mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with a controlled face, though in the eyes there was an expression such as wild animals betray when they fear the trap.He was surrounded by the unknown, apprehensive of what might happen, ignorant of what he should do, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly, fearful that every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted.He was keenly sensitive, hopelessly self-conscious, and the amused glance that the other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him like a dagger-thrust.He saw the glance, but he gave no sign, for among the things he had learned was discipline.Also, that dagger-thrust went to his pride.He cursed himself for having come, and at the same time resolved that, happen what would, having come, he would carry it through.The lines of his face hardened, and into his eyes came a fighting light.He looked about more unconcernedly, sharply observant, every detail of the pretty interior registering itself on his brain.His eyes were wide apart; nothing in their field of vision escaped; and as they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and a warm glow took its place.He was responsive to beauty, and here was cause to respond.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他被一幅油画吸引住了。巨浪轰鸣着在一块横空斜出的岩石上方爆裂开来；孕育着风暴的乌云低垂着布满天空；浪涛的轮廓线外是一艘领港船正在风暴将至的落日天空下迎风前进，船身倾斜着，甲板上的一切都清晰可见。这便是美，无可抗拒地吸引住了他。他忘掉了自己笨拙的步伐，向那幅画靠近，靠得非常近。美从画布上消失了。他的脸色表达了他的困惑。他瞪着那片仿佛是胡乱涂抹的画，然后走开了。那美又瞬间全部回到了画布上。“一幅错觉画。”他转身走开时想，在纷至沓来的众多印象中，他还感到被愤怒刺了一下：那么多的美竟被用来做一幅错觉画。他不懂绘画。他从小只见过彩色石印和石版画，远看近看都是轮廓分明、线条清晰的。他也见过油画，这倒不假，是在商店的展示橱窗里，只是橱窗玻璃让他渴望的眼睛无法靠得太近。</td>
		<td class="en">An oil painting caught and held him.A heavy surf thundered and burst over an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and, outside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a stormy sunset sky.There was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly.He forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close.The beauty faded out of the canvas.His face expressed his bepuzzlement.He stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then stepped away.Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas.“A trick picture,” was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick.He did not know painting.He had been brought up on chromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or far.He had seen oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of shops, but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他瞥了一眼还在看信的朋友，看见了桌上的书。他的眼中立即闪现出一种期待和渴望，就好像饥饿的人看到了食物那般。他冲动地迈出一大步，肩膀左右一晃便来到了桌边，在那里开始热切地翻阅起来。他浏览了书名和作者，读了些文章的片段，用眼神和双手爱抚书，有一次还认出了一本读过的书。而其余的书都是陌生的，作者也是陌生的。他偶然看起一本斯温伯恩的书，便一直看了下去，脸上放出光芒，全然忘了自己身处何地。他两次用食指插着合上书，好看看作者的名字。斯温伯恩！他会记住这个名字的。这家伙有眼光，他肯定把握住了色彩和那一闪即逝的光芒。但斯温伯格是谁呢？他也像大多数诗人那样已经死去一百多年了吗？抑或他仍然在世，仍在创作？他翻到书名页……是的，他还写过其他书；好吧，明早第一件事就是去免费图书馆，看能不能借到他的书籍。他重又看起书来，看得出了神。他没有注意到一位年轻女士已经进了房间。他首先注意到的是阿瑟的声音：</td>
		<td class="en">He glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on the table.Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food.An impulsive stride, with one lurch to right and left of the shoulders, brought him to the table, where he began affectionately handling the books.He glanced at the titles and the authors’ names, read fragments of text, caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands, and, once, recognized a book he had read.For the rest, they were strange books and strange authors.He chanced upon a volume of Swinburne and began reading steadily, forgetful of where he was, his face glowing.Twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the name of the author.Swinburne!he would remember that name.That fellow had eyes, and he had certainly seen color and flashing light.But who was Swinburne?Was he dead a hundred years or so, like most of the poets?Or was he alive still, and writing?He turned to the title-page…yes, he had written other books; well, he would go to the free library the first thing in the morning and try to get hold of some of Swinburne’s stuff.He went back to the text and lost himself.He did not notice that a young woman had entered the room.The first he knew was when he heard Arthur’s voice saying:—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“鲁思，这位是伊登先生。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ruth, this is Mr. Eden.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把食指插在书中合上书，还没转过身来就已经为这崭新的第一印象而激动了，但这并非因为那女孩，而是因为她哥哥的话。在他肌肉发达的身体下面，布满了颤抖的敏感神经。外部世界对他意识最轻微的刺激也能使他的思想、感受和情绪犹如摇曳的火焰一样跳动起来。他异常善于接纳和回应，而他的想象力活跃，总在为事物的异同建立着联系。正是“伊登先生”这个称呼使他激动——他一生都被人称为“伊登”、“马丁·伊登”或者只是“马丁”。现在成了“先生”！这实在是太妙了，他心想。他的头脑似乎立刻化为一台巨大的投影仪，在他的意识中呈现出无数的生活画面：锅炉舱和水手舱、帐篷和海滩、监狱和酒吧、高烧病房和贫民窟的街道，在各种各样的环境中别人跟他的关系都表现在对他的那些称呼上。</td>
		<td class="en">The book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was thrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but of her brother’s words.Under that muscled body of his he was a mass of quivering sensibilities.At the slightest impact of the outside world upon his consciousness, his thoughts, sympathies, and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame.He was extraordinarily receptive and responsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever at work establishing relations of likeness and difference.“Mr. Eden,” was what he had thrilled to—he who had been called “Eden,” or “Martin Eden,” or just “Martin,” all his life.And “Mister!”It was certainly going some, was his internal comment.His mind seemed to turn, on the instant, into a vast camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around his consciousness endless pictures from his life, of stoke-holes and forecastles, camps and beaches, jails and boozing-kens, fever-hospitals and slum streets, wherein the thread of association was the fashion in which he had been addressed in those various situations.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他转过身来，看到了那个女孩。一见到她，他脑中的种种幻影便都消失不见了。她脸色苍白、体态轻盈，有一对超凡脱俗的蓝色大眼睛，还有一头浓密的金发。他不知道她的穿着如何，只知道她的衣服跟她本人一样好看。他将她比作一朵嫩枝上的淡淡金花。不对，她是个精灵，是个仙子，是个女神；她那升华了的美绝不属于人世间。也许书里说的是对的，在上流社会里有许许多多像她这样的美。她可能也被斯温伯恩那个家伙歌唱过。或许当他描绘桌上那本书里的伊索尔特时，心中想的便是这样一个女孩。所有这些大量的景象、情感和思绪都发生在顷刻间。而在他所处的现实中，一切都不曾中断。他看见她向自己伸出手来，握手时像男人般坦率地直视着他的双眼。他所认识的那些女人可不这样握手。事实上，她们中的大多数根本不和人握手。一阵联想袭来，他结识女人的各种方式涌进他的脑袋，几乎把他淹没。但他把它们甩在一边，只看着她。他从没见过这样一个女人。他所认识的那些女人呀！她们顷刻间在她的两边排列开来。在那永恒的瞬间，他身处一家肖像画廊内，中心位置为她所占据，很多其他女人出现在她的四周，飞快地瞥一眼便能知道她们的体重和尺寸，而她便是衡量的标准。他看到脸色憔悴的工厂女孩和市场南面傻笑喧闹的女孩。还有牧牛区的女人和墨西哥抽烟的黑皮肤老妇女。这些形象转而又被玩偶般走着碎步、脚踩木屐的日本妇女所取代，被面容姣好却又刻上了堕落烙印的欧亚混血儿取代，被身材魁梧、头戴花环、褐色皮肤的南海岛屿妇女所取代。而所有这些形象全都让位给了一群奇形怪状、噩梦般的女人——怀特察普尔人行道上散发着臭味、躲躲闪闪的女人，贫民窟里醉醺醺的妓女，还有一大群地狱来的悍妇，她们满嘴脏话，肮脏下流，乔装成凶悍的妇女来掠夺水手，搜索着港口的垃圾和贫民窟的残渣。</td>
		<td class="en">And then he turned and saw the girl.The phantasmagoria of his brain vanished at sight of her.She was a pale, ethereal creature, with wide, spiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair.He did not know how she was dressed, except that the dress was as wonderful as she.He likened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem.No, she was a spirit, a divinity, a goddess; such sublimated beauty was not of the earth.Or perhaps the books were right, and there were many such as she in the upper walks of life.She might well be sung by that chap, Swinburne.Perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted that girl, Iseult, in the book there on the table.All this plethora of sight, and feeling, and thought occurred on the instant.There was no pause of the realities wherein he moved.He saw her hand coming out to his, and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands, frankly, like a man.The women he had known did not shake hands that way.For that matter, most of them did not shake hands at all.A flood of associations, visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women, rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it.But he shook them aside and looked at her.Never had he seen such a woman.The women he had known!Immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged the women he had known.For an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait gallery, wherein she occupied the central place, while about her were limned many women, all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance, herself the unit of weight and measure.He saw the weak and sickly faces of the girls of the factories, and the simpering, boisterous girls from the south of Market.There were women of the cattle camps, and swarthy cigarette-smoking women of Old Mexico.These, in turn, were crowded out by Japanese women, doll-like, stepping mincingly on wooden clogs; by Eurasians, delicate featured, stamped with degeneracy; by full-bodied South-Sea-Island women, flower-crowned and brown-skinned.All these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare brood—frowsy, shuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel, gin-bloated hags of the stews, and all the vast hell’s following of harpies, vile-mouthed and filthy, that under the guise of monstrous female form prey upon sailors, the scrapings of the ports, the scum and slime of the human pit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请坐，伊登先生，”那女孩说道，</td>
		<td class="en">“Won’t you sit down, Mr. Eden?” the girl was saying.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“自从阿瑟告诉我们之后我就一直盼望着见到你。你真勇敢……”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have been looking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur told us.It was brave of you—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他不以为然地挥了挥手，含糊不清地表示那根本不算什么，任何人都会像他那么做的。她注意到他挥动的那只手上有尚未愈合的擦伤，瞥了一眼另一只松垂着的手，发现也是情况一样。再迅速地一打量，她发现他脸颊上有一道伤疤，前额的头发下也露出一道，还有一道顺脖子而下消失在浆硬的领子里。她看到他那古铜色的脖子上被领子磨出的红印时差点笑了出来。他显然适应不了硬领。同样，她那女性的眼睛也注意到了他的衣服，那廉价而缺乏品位的剪裁，外套肩以及袖子上一道道褶皱像在为他那鼓起的二头肌做广告。</td>
		<td class="en">He waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at all, what he had done, and that any fellow would have done it.She noticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions, in the process of healing, and a glance at the other loose-hanging hand showed it to be in the same condition.Also, with quick, critical eye, she noted a scar on his cheek, another that peeped out from under the hair of the forehead, and a third that ran down and disappeared under the starched collar.She repressed a smile at sight of the red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck.He was evidently unused to stiff collars.Likewise her feminine eye took in the clothes he wore, the cheap and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of the coat across the shoulders, and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他挥手并含糊地表示自己并没做什么时，也打算遵从她的要求找椅子坐下。他抽空欣赏了她坐下时的轻松优雅，便跌跌撞撞地走向她对面的一把椅子，心中完全明白自己的样子是多么笨拙。这对他来说是种新的体验。直到刚才之前，他一辈子也没留意过外表的优雅或是笨拙。这种自我意识从没进过他的脑袋。他小心翼翼地在椅子边缘坐下，同时非常担心他的双手。不管放在哪里，它们都很碍事。阿瑟离开了房间，马丁·伊登不情愿地看着他走掉。与那苍白的、仙女般的女人独处一室使他感到不知所措。这里没有酒吧老板可以叫酒来喝，也没有小孩可以打发去街角买啤酒，因此没法用社交的饮料来开始亲密的友谊。</td>
		<td class="en">While he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all, he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair.He found time to admire the ease with which she sat down, then lurched toward a chair facing her, overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was cutting.This was a new experience for him.All his life, up to then, he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward.Such thoughts of self had never entered his mind.He sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair, greatly worried by his hands.They were in the way wherever he put them.Arthur was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his exit with longing eyes.He felt lost, alone there in the room with that pale spirit of a woman.There was no bar-keeper upon whom to call for drinks, no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by means of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你脖子上有那样一条伤疤，伊登先生，”那女孩说道，“那是怎么来的？我确信那一定是次冒险。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You have such a scar on your neck, Mr. Eden,” the girl was saying.“How did it happen?I am sure it must have been some adventure.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“被一个墨西哥人用刀划伤的，小姐，”他舔了舔干渴的嘴唇，清了清嗓子回答道，“只不过是打架而已。我把他的刀弄掉以后，他还想把我的鼻子给咬掉。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A Mexican with a knife, miss,” he answered, moistening his parched lips and clearing hip throat.“It was just a fight.After I got the knife away, he tried to bite off my nose.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管说得不好，但他眼前却浮现出了萨利纳克鲁斯那个炎热的星夜里各种的景象。有狭长的白色海滩，港口运糖船的灯光，远处醉酒的水手们的声音，熙熙攘攘的码头苦力，墨西哥人脸上那火热的怒气，星光下那露出凶光的野兽般的眼睛，钢刀在自己脖子上的那种刺痛，那喷涌而出的鲜血，那人群，那叫喊，他和墨西哥人的躯体纠缠翻滚，沙尘飞扬，遥远的某处传来动听的吉他声。这便是那幅画，现在想起来也还是令他激动，他想知道画出墙上领航船那幅画的画家是否能把这个场景也画下来。他想，那白色的沙滩、点点的星光、运糖船的灯火，还有沙滩中间围观打斗者的黑压压的人群，若是画出来一定会很棒。他决定在画里给那把刀留个位置，如果在星光下带点闪光那就更棒了。但这一切他都丝毫没有提及。“他还想把我的鼻子给咬掉。”他结束了回答。</td>
		<td class="en">Baldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot, starry night at Salina Cruz,the white strip of beach, the lights of the sugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in the distance, the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the Mexican’s face, the glint of the beast-eyes in the starlight, the sting of the steel in his neck, and the rush of blood, the crowd and the cries, the two bodies, his and the Mexican’s, locked together, rolling over and over and tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling of a guitar.Such was the picture, and he thrilled to the memory of it, wondering if the man could paint it who had painted the pilot-schooner on the wall.The white beach, the stars, and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great, he thought, and midway on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters.The knife occupied a place in the picture, he decided, and would show well, with a sort of gleam, in the light of the stars.But of all this no hint had crept into his speech.“He tried to bite off my nose,” he concluded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊。”那女孩说，声音微弱而遥远，他注意到她敏感的脸上显露出的震惊。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh,” the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the shock in her sensitive face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他自己也感到震惊，被太阳晒黑的脸颊因尴尬而微微有些发红，尽管事实上他已燥热得仿佛暴露在锅炉舱敞开的炉门前。打架动刀子这类低贱的事显然不适合成为与一位女士交谈的话题。书里的人们，她那个阶层的人们，是不会谈论这类事的——或许他们根本不知道这类事。</td>
		<td class="en">He felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on his sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks had been exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room.Such sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for conversation with a lady.People in the books, in her walk of life, did not talk about such things—perhaps they did not know about them, either.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们努力想要开始的谈话稍稍停顿了一下。然后她试探性地问起他脸上的伤疤。她的问话刚一出口，他便意识到她正努力着谈自己的话题，便决定抛开这个话题转而去谈她的话题。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get started.Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek.Even as she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk, and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“只是一次意外罢了，”他边说边用手摸了摸脸颊，“一天晚上，一丝风也没有，却碰上了湍急的海流，主吊杆的吊索断了，接着复滑车也坏了。吊索是钢缆做的，像蛇一样猛烈抽打着。所有值班水手都想抓住它，我冲了上去，然后就挨了一鞭。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It was just an accident,” he said, putting his hand to his cheek.“One night, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main-boom-lift carried away, an’ next the tackle.The lift was wire, an’ it was threshin’ around like a snake.The whole watch was tryin’ to grab it, an’ I rushed in an’ got swatted.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊。”她说。这次带着理解的口气，尽管暗地里觉得他说的话简直无法理解，她不知道什么是“吊索”，也不知道“挨了一鞭”是何种感受。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh,” she said, this time with an accent of comprehension, though secretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering what a lift was and what swatted meant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个叫斯外温伯恩的人。”他说道，打算执行自己的计划，却把“斯温”念成了“斯外恩”。</td>
		<td class="en">“This man Swineburne,” he began, attempting to put his plan into execution and pronouncing the i long.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Who?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“斯外恩伯恩，”他重复道，但还是念错了音，“那个诗人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Swineburne,” he repeated, with the same mispronunciation.“The poet.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是斯温伯恩。”她纠正道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Swinburne,” she corrected.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，就是那个家伙，”他结结巴巴地说，脸颊又发热了，“他死了有多久了？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, that’s the chap,” he stammered, his cheeks hot again.“How long since he died?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么？我没听说他死了呀。”她莫名其妙地望着他。“你在哪里认识他的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, I haven’t heard that he was dead.”She looked at him curiously.“Where did you make his acquaintance?”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是她便就他提起的话题轻松、快速地谈了起来。他感觉好多了，从椅子边缘稍稍往后靠了靠，并紧紧地握住扶手，生怕它会挣脱，把他摔在地上。他成功地使她谈起了她的话题。她侃侃而谈，他则努力跟上，他惊讶于她那美丽的脑袋竟装了那么多知识，同时也尽情欣赏着她那苍白而美丽的脸庞。他跟上了她的话，尽管她唇边不经意流淌出的陌生词汇、评论术语和他从未知晓的思维过程使他感到有些吃力，但仍刺激了他的头脑，使之兴奋。这便是智力生活，他想，这便是美，连做梦都想不到它竟是如此温暖、美好。他忘却了自我，饥渴的双眼紧盯着她。这便是一个人为之生活、为之奋斗、为之争取的东西——是的，为之献出生命的东西。那些书说的是对的。世上确有这样的女子。她便是其中之一。她为他的想象插上翅膀，巨大而光辉的画布在他眼前展开，画布上隐约可见的模糊而巨大的形象，那是爱情，是浪漫故事，是为女人而做出的英雄事迹——为一个苍白的女人，一朵金色的花朵。那摇晃、悸动的景象犹如仙女创造的海市蜃楼，透过它，他凝视着这个坐在那里谈论文学与艺术的真实的女人。他同样倾听着，但完全没有意识到自己已目不转睛，也不知道自己眼中闪耀的正是他天性中的阳刚之气。她虽对男人的世界所知甚少，但身为一个女人，还是敏锐地察觉到了他火热的眼神。她从未见过男人这般看她，这使她局促不安。她说话变得结巴，没有再说下去。思路离她而去。他把她吓到了，但同时，被这样看着她竟出奇地感到愉快。她的教养警告她有危险，有不应有的、微妙的、神秘的诱惑；但她的本能却发出了嘹亮的呐喊，穿透她的身体，驱使她克服阶级、地位和得失的障碍奔向这个来自另一个世界的旅人，奔向这个手上有伤、喉咙被不习惯的亚麻布磨出红印的粗俗的年轻人，这个年轻人很明显已经受了粗野生活方式的污染。她是纯洁的，她的纯洁令她对这个年轻人感到抵触；但她同时又是女人，她刚开始体会到女人的矛盾。</td>
		<td class="en">And thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had suggested.He felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge of the chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor.He had succeeded in making her talk her talk, and while she rattled on, he strove to follow her, marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head of hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of her face.Follow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases and thought-processes that were foreign to his mind, but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set it tingling.Here was intellectual life, he thought, and here was beauty, warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be.He forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes.Here was something to live for, to win to, to fight for—ay, and die for.The books were true.There were such women in the world.She was one of them.She lent wings to his imagination, and great, luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed vague, gigantic figures of love and romance, and of heroic deeds for woman’s sake—for a pale woman, a flower of gold.And through the swaying, palpitant vision, as through a fairy mirage, he stared at the real woman, sitting there and talking of literature and art.He listened as well, but he stared, unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes.But she, who knew little of the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his burning eyes.She had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it embarrassed her.She stumbled and halted in her utterance.The thread of argument slipped from her.He frightened her, and at the same time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon.Her training warned her of peril and of wrong, subtle, mysterious, luring; while her instincts rang clarion-voiced through her being, impelling her to hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world, to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently, was soiled and tainted by ungracious existence.She was clean, and her cleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to learn the paradox of woman.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Martin Eden nodded.He had caught a glimpse of the apparently illimitable vistas of knowledge.What he saw took on tangibility.His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.In the alchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics and the whole field of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much landscape.The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest glades, all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights.In the distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze, but behind this purple haze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the lure of romance.It was like wine to him.Here was adventure, something to do with head and hand, a world to conquer—and straightway from the back of his consciousness rushed the thought, conquering, to win to her, that lily-pale spirit sitting beside him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur, who, all evening, had been trying to draw his wild man out.Martin Eden remembered his decision.For the first time he became himself, consciously and deliberately at first, but soon lost in the joy of creating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners’ eyes.He had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner Halcyon when she was captured by a revenue cutter.He saw with wide eyes, and he could tell what he saw.He brought the pulsing sea before them, and the men and the ships upon the sea.He communicated his power of vision, till they saw with his eyes what he had seen.He selected from the vast mass of detail with an artist’s touch, drawing pictures of life that glowed and burned with light and color, injecting movement so that his listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough eloquence, enthusiasm, and power.At times he shocked them with the vividness of the narrative and his terms of speech, but beauty always followed fast upon the heels of violence, and tragedy was relieved by humor, by interpretations of the strange twists and quirks of sailors’ minds.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马丁·伊登走下台阶时，把一只手伸进了外套口袋里。他从口袋里取出一张褐色卷烟纸和一撮墨西哥烟叶，将它们灵巧地卷成一根烟。他把第一口烟深深地吸进肺中，然后吐出了一条长长的、萦绕不散的烟雾。“上帝啊！”他大声说，声音中带着敬畏和惊奇。“上帝啊！”他重复了一遍。然后他又喃喃地说了一遍：“上帝啊！”随后他的手伸向领子，一把将它从衬衫上扯下来，塞进口袋中。天空中下着冰冷的细雨，但他却将头暴露在雨中，还解开了背心的扣子，摇摇晃晃地走着，一副满不在乎的痛快样子。他只是模糊地意识到在下雨。他处于狂喜的状态，做着梦，回味着刚刚过去的那些场景。</td>
		<td class="en">As Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat pocket.It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican tobacco, which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette.He drew the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long and lingering exhalation.“By God!” he said aloud, in a voice of awe and wonder.“By God!” he repeated.And yet again he murmured, “By God!”Then his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and stuffed into his pocket.A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his head to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid unconcern.He was only dimly aware that it was raining.He was in an ecstasy, dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他终于遇见那个女人了——他很少想到她，他不热衷于想女人，但仍隐隐期待着有一天会遇见她。他刚坐在她身旁一起吃饭。他刚抚摸了她的手，凝视了她的双眼，捕捉到了一个美丽的仙女幻影——但并不比闪现出这般幻影的眼睛本身美丽，也不比给予它表情和形态的肉体美丽。他并没有把她的肉体视为肉体——这对他可是新鲜事；因为对于那些他认识的女人，那是他看待她们唯一的方式。不知怎么的，她的肉体有些不同。他不认为她的身体是身体，是会生病和有弱点的身体。她的身体不只是她精神的外衣。它是她精神的流露，是她神圣精华纯净而优雅的结晶。这种神圣的感觉令他震惊。这令他从梦中一下子回到了清醒的思考中。从没有神圣的话语、线索和暗示影响过他。他从未相信过神圣的事情。他一向不相信宗教，总是心平气和地嘲笑那些引领人们进入天堂的人和他们不朽的灵魂。他曾坚信死后没有来生；生命只存在于此地，只存在于此刻，之后便是无尽的黑暗。但他从她眼中看到了灵魂——不死的、永恒的灵魂。他认识的人中，无论男女，没有一个曾给过他关于永恒的信息。但她给了他。她第一次看他的时候便将这个信息悄悄告诉了他。他往前走着，她的面容一直在他眼前闪耀——苍白而严肃，甜美而敏感；微笑时带着怜爱和温柔，只有仙女才会这样微笑；如此纯洁，他从未梦想过纯洁原来可以达到这种程度。她的纯洁犹如一击击倒了他。他为之震惊。他见过善与恶；可作为生命特性的纯洁却从未进入他的心中。现在在她身上，他认为纯洁是善良与洁净的最高形式，它们的总体便成了永恒的生命。</td>
		<td class="en">He had met the woman at last—the woman that he had thought little about, not being given to thinking about women, but whom he had expected, in a remote way, he would sometime meet.He had sat next to her at table.He had felt her hand in his, he had looked into her eyes and caught a vision of a beautiful spirit;—but no more beautiful than the eyes through which it shone, nor than the flesh that gave it expression and form.He did not think of her flesh as flesh,—which was new to him; for of the women he had known that was the only way he thought.Her flesh was somehow different.He did not conceive of her body as a body, subject to the ills and frailties of bodies.Her body was more than the garb of her spirit.It was an emanation of her spirit, a pure and gracious crystallization of her divine essence.This feeling of the divine startled him.It shocked him from his dreams to sober thought.No word, no clew, no hint, of the divine had ever reached him before.He had never believed in the divine.He had always been irreligious, scoffing good-naturedly at the sky-pilots and their immortality of the soul.There was no life beyond, he had contended; it was here and now, then darkness everlasting.But what he had seen in her eyes was soul—immortal soul that could never die.No man he had known, nor any woman, had given him the message of immortality.But she had.She had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him.Her face shimmered before his eyes as he walked along,—pale and serious, sweet and sensitive, smiling with pity and tenderness as only a spirit could smile, and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be.Her purity smote him like a blow.It startled him.He had known good and bad; but purity, as an attribute of existence, had never entered his mind.And now, in her, he conceived purity to be the superlative of goodness and of cleanness, the sum of which constituted eternal life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是他的雄心立刻敦促他抓住这永恒的生命。他连给她端水都不配——他明白这一点；是奇迹般的好运和不可思议的福分才使他能在那晚见到她，与她相处，同她说话。这一切都是偶然。没什么值得高兴的。他不配有这样的幸运。他的情绪在本质上是宗教性的。他谦卑、温顺，充满了对自己的轻视和贬低。罪人们正是在这样的思想状态下来到忏悔的长凳上的。他被判有罪。但正如温顺、谦卑的罪人们坐在忏悔的长凳上瞥见了他们辉煌而高贵的未来生活，他也瞥见了通过占有她所能获得的生活。但占有她的前途模糊而渺茫，与他所知的占有完全不同。雄心展开疯狂的翅膀升向高空，他看到自己正和她一起攀登高山，分享彼此的想法，彼此都沉浸在美好高贵的事物中。他梦想的是一种灵魂上的占有，脱俗的高雅，一种难以确切表达出来的、自由的精神友谊。他没有想过。关于这方面，他完全没有想过。感官取代了理智，他怀着从未体验过的激情颤抖着、悸动着，在感官的海洋上怡然自得地漂浮着，感觉本身得到了升华并化为精神，超越了生命的最高峰。</td>
		<td class="en">And promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life.He was not fit to carry water for her—he knew that; it was a miracle of luck and a fantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and talk with her that night.It was accidental.There was no merit in it.He did not deserve such fortune.His mood was essentially religious.He was humble and meek, filled with self-disparagement and abasement.In such frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form.He was convicted of sin.But as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid glimpses of their future lordly existence, so did he catch similar glimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing her.But this possession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from possession as he had known it.Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself climbing the heights with her, sharing thoughts with her, pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her.It was a soul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought.He did not think it.For that matter, he did not think at all.Sensation usurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had never known, drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling itself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of life.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He lighted his cigarette, said good night, and went on.“Now wouldn’t that rattle you?” he ejaculated under his breath.“That copper thought I was drunk.”He smiled to himself and meditated.“I guess I was,” he added; “but I didn’t think a woman’s face’d do it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他坐上电报街一辆开往伯克利的电车。车上挤满了少年和年轻人，他们唱着歌，时不时地喊几句大学拉拉队的口号。他好奇地打量着他们。他们是大学生。他们和她去的是同一所学校，在社会地位上和她相等，可能认识她，如果想的话可以每天都见到她。他不明白为什么那晚他们宁愿在外玩乐而不是呆在她身边，崇拜且爱慕地围着她坐成一圈和她聊天。他继续漫无目的地想了下去。他注意到有个小伙子眼睛眯成两条细缝，嘴唇松垮垮地张着。他断定这小子很恶毒。到了船上，他准会是一个鬼鬼祟祟、牢骚满腹、搬弄是非的人。他，马丁·伊登先生，比那家伙强多了。这个想法使他高兴。似乎这让他离她又近了一步。他开始拿自己和那些学生作比较。他逐渐意识到自己体格强健有力，自信自己在体力上是他们的师父。但他们的脑袋里装满了知识，使他们能够谈论她的话题——这想法使他压抑。但脑子是用来干吗的？他激动地问道。他们做到的，他一样能做到。他们从书中学习生活，而他则一直在忙碌地生活着。他的脑子和他们的一样装满了知识，只不过是不同种类的知识罢了。他们中有多少人会给绳子打结，会掌舵，会瞭望？他的生活如图画般一幅幅在他眼前展开，有危难和冒险，有磨难和劳累。他想起学习过程中的失败和挫折。但不管怎样他都非常优秀。今后他们也要开始生活，像他一样经历磨难。很好。当他们忙于生活时，他就可以从书中学习生活的另一面了。</td>
		<td class="en">He caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley.It was crowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and again barking out college yells.He studied them curiously.They were university boys.They went to the same university that she did, were in her class socially, could know her, could see her every day if they wanted to.He wondered that they did not want to, that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her that evening, talking with her, sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle.His thoughts wandered on.He noticed one with narrow-slitted eyes and a loose-lipped mouth.That fellow was vicious, he decided.On shipboard he would be a sneak, a whiner, a tattler.He, Martin Eden, was a better man than that fellow.The thought cheered him.It seemed to draw him nearer to Her.He began comparing himself with the students.He grew conscious of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that he was physically their master.But their heads were filled with knowledge that enabled them to talk her talk,—the thought depressed him.But what was a brain for? he demanded passionately.What they had done, he could do.They had been studying about life from the books while he had been busy living life.His brain was just as full of knowledge as theirs, though it was a different kind of knowledge.How many of them could tie a lanyard knot, or take a wheel or a lookout?His life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and daring, hardship and toil.He remembered his failures and scrapes in the process of learning.He was that much to the good, anyway.Later on they would have to begin living life and going through the mill as he had gone.Very well.While they were busy with that, he could be learning the other side of life from the books.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >电车经过一片住宅稀疏的地区，这个地区把奥克兰和伯克利分隔开来，这时他一直在留意一幢熟悉的两层楼建筑，楼前树着一块神气的招牌：希金博特姆现金商店。马丁·伊登在这个街角下了车。他抬头看了一会儿招牌。这块招牌除了字面意思外，还向他传达其他的信息。一个小气、自负、卑鄙小人的形象似乎从那些字母本身就能散发出来。伯纳德·希金博特姆娶了他的姐姐，他很了解这个人。他用一把弹簧钥匙自己开了门，爬楼梯上了二楼。这里住着他的姐夫。杂货店在楼下。空气中有股蔬菜发霉的臭味。他摸索着穿过门厅时被一辆玩具汽车给绊了一下，那是他无数侄子侄女中的一个落在那里的，玩具车被他碰得撞在门上，发出砰的一声巨响。“守财奴，”他心想，“舍不得花两分钱煤气把灯点上，好让房客留着脖子。”</td>
		<td class="en">As the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated Oakland from Berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story building along the front of which ran the proud sign, HIGGINBOTHAM’S CASH STORE.Martin Eden got off at this corner.He stared up for a moment at the sign.It carried a message to him beyond its mere wording.A personality of smallness and egotism and petty underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves.Bernard Higginbotham had married his sister, and he knew him well.He let himself in with a latch-key and climbed the stairs to the second floor.Here lived his brother-in-law.The grocery was below.There was a smell of stale vegetables in the air.As he groped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy-cart, left there by one of his numerous nephews and nieces, and brought up against a door with a resounding bang.“The pincher,” was his thought; “too miserly to burn two cents’ worth of gas and save his boarders’ necks.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他摸索着找到了门把手，进了一间亮着灯的房间，里面坐着他的姐姐和伯纳德·希金博特姆。姐姐正在修补姐夫的一条裤子，姐夫那瘦瘦的身体躺在两把椅子上，穿着破烂的绒拖鞋的脚在另一把椅子边上晃荡。他从正在读的那张报纸顶上瞥了他一眼，露出一对漆黑虚伪而警惕的眼睛。马丁·伊登每次看到他都觉得一阵恶心。他真不理解姐姐看上他哪点了。在他看来那个人就像条寄生虫，总使他产生一种将他踩死在脚下的冲动。“总有一天我会把他的脸打烂。”他时常这样安慰自己以忍受这个家伙的存在。那双恶毒的、鼬鼠般的眼睛正不满地盯着他。</td>
		<td class="en">He fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room, where sat his sister and Bernard Higginbotham.She was patching a pair of his trousers, while his lean body was distributed over two chairs, his feet dangling in dilapidated carpet-slippers over the edge of the second chair.He glanced across the top of the paper he was reading, showing a pair of dark, insincere, sharp-staring eyes.Martin Eden never looked at him without experiencing a sense of repulsion.What his sister had seen in the man was beyond him.The other affected him as so much vermin, and always aroused in him an impulse to crush him under his foot.“Some day I’ll beat the face off of him,” was the way he often consoled himself for enduring the man’s existence.The eyes, weasel-like and cruel, were looking at him complainingly.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马丁想回击他，但想到这没什么用便放弃了。他越过那丑陋肮脏的灵魂，去看墙上的那幅彩色石印画。他大吃一惊。他以前一直很喜欢这幅画，可现在好像是他第一次见到它。它太廉价，就是这样，跟房子里其他所有东西一样。他的心又回到了刚离开的那幢房子，首先看到了那里的画，接着是她，她正跟他握手告别，正用让人融化的甜美注视着自己。他忘了自己身在何方，忘了伯纳德·希金博特姆的存在，直到那位绅士问道：</td>

		<td class="en">And so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he stared at the shelves packed with wisdom.In one miscellaneous section he came upon a @Norrie’s Epitome@.He turned the pages reverently.In a way, it spoke a kindred speech.Both he and it were of the sea.Then he found a “Bowditch” and books by Lecky and Marshall.There it was; he would teach himself navigation.He would quit drinking, work up, and become a captain.Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment.As a captain, he could marry her (if she would have him).And if she wouldn’t, well—he would live a good life among men, because of Her, and he would quit drinking anyway.Then he remembered the underwriters and the owners, the two masters a captain must serve, either of which could and would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed.He cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books.No; no more of the sea for him.There was power in all that wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do them on the land.Besides, captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The many books he read but served to whet his unrest.Every page of every book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge.His hunger fed upon what he read, and increased.Also, he did not know where to begin, and continually suffered from lack of preparation.The commonest references, that he could see plainly every reader was expected to know, he did not know.And the same was true of the poetry he read which maddened him with delight.He read more of Swinburne than was contained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and “Dolores” he understood thoroughly.But surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded.How could she, living the refined life she did?Then he chanced upon Kipling’s poems, and was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour with which familiar things had been invested.He was amazed at the man’s sympathy with life and at his incisive psychology.Psychology was a new word in Martin’s vocabulary.He had bought a dictionary, which deed had decreased his supply of money and brought nearer the day on which he must sail in search of more.Also, it incensed Mr. Higginbotham, who would have preferred the money taking the form of board.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He dared not go near Ruth’s neighborhood in the daytime, but night found him lurking like a thief around the Morse home, stealing glimpses at the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her.Several times he barely escaped being caught by her brothers, and once he trailed Mr. Morse down town and studied his face in the lighted streets, longing all the while for some quick danger of death to threaten so that he might spring in and save her father.On another night, his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a second-story window.He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror.It was only for a moment, but it was a long moment to him, during which his blood turned to wine and sang through his veins.Then she pulled down the shade.But it was her room—he had learned that; and thereafter he strayed there often, hiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of the street and smoking countless cigarettes.One afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a bank, and received another proof of the enormous distance that separated Ruth from him.She was of the class that dealt with banks.He had never been inside a bank in his life, and he had an idea that such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very powerful.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In one way, he had undergone a moral revolution.Her cleanness and purity had reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need to be clean.He must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the same air with her.He washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands with a kitchen scrub-brush till he saw a nail-brush in a drug-store window and divined its use.While purchasing it, the clerk glanced at his nails, suggested a nail-file, and so he became possessed of an additional toilet-tool.He ran across a book in the library on the care of the body, and promptly developed a penchant for a cold-water bath every morning, much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr. Higginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high-fangled notions and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra for the water.Another stride was in the direction of creased trousers.Now that Martin was aroused in such matters, he swiftly noted the difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working class and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men above the working class.Also, he learned the reason why, and invaded his sister’s kitchen in search of irons and ironing-board.He had misadventures at first, hopelessly burning one pair and buying another, which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must put to sea.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Once they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on easily—more easily by far than he had expected.She made it easy for him; and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever.They talked first of the borrowed books, of the Swinburne he was devoted to, and of the Browning he did not understand; and she led the conversation on from subject to subject, while she pondered the problem of how she could be of help to him.She had thought of this often since their first meeting.She wanted to help him.He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever made before, and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal in her.Her pity could not be of the common sort, when the man who drew it was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind and pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings.The old fascination of his neck was there, and there was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it.It seemed still a wanton impulse, but she had grown more used to it.She did not dream that in such guise new-born love would epitomize itself.Nor did she dream that the feeling he excited in her was love.She thought she was merely interested in him as an unusual type possessing various potential excellencies, and she even felt philanthropic about it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">His swift development was a source of surprise and interest.She detected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by day, like flowers in congenial soil.She read Browning aloud to him, and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages.It was beyond her to realize that, out of his experience of men and women and life, his interpretations were far more frequently correct than hers.His conceptions seemed naive to her, though she was often fired by his daring flights of comprehension, whose orbit-path was so wide among the stars that she could not follow and could only sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power.Then she played to him—no longer at him—and probed him with music that sank to depths beyond her plumb-line.His nature opened to music as a flower to the sun, and the transition was quick from his working-class rag-time and jingles to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart.Yet he betrayed a democratic fondness for Wagner, and the “Tannhäuser” overture, when she had given him the clew to it, claimed him as nothing else she played.In an immediate way it personified his life.All his past was the Venusburg motif, while her he identified somehow with the “Pilgrim’s Chorus” motif; and from the exalted state this elevated him to, he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow-realm of spirit-groping, where good and evil war eternally.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to San Francisco was like a dream.He was drunken with unguessed power and felt that he could do anything.In the midst of the great and lonely sea　he gained perspective.Clearly, and for the first lime, he saw Ruth and her world.It was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and examine.There was much that was dim and nebulous in that world, but he saw it as a whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to master it.To write!The thought was fire in him.He would begin as soon as he got back.The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasure-hunters.He would sell it to some San Francisco newspaper.He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print.While he wrote, he could go on studying.There were twenty-four hours in each day.He was invincible.He knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him.He would not have to go to sea again—as a sailor; and for the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht.There were other writers who possessed steam yachts.Of course, he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding at first, and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying.And then, after some time,—a very indeterminate time,—when he had learned and prepared himself, he would write the great things and his name would be on all men’s lips.But greater than that, infinitely greater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of Ruth.Fame was all very well, but it was for Ruth that his splendid dream arose.He was not a fame-monger, but merely one of God’s mad lovers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了奥克兰，口袋里装着一笔数目可观的工钱，他又住在伯纳德·希金博特姆那里的老房间里，开始工作了。他甚至没让鲁思知道自己回来了。等他写完寻宝人的文章之后会去看她的。由于他心里正燃烧着那股创作的热情，克制着不去看她，也不是很难。另外，他正写着的文章会使她更靠近他。他不知道该写多长的文章，但是在《旧金山考察报》周日增刊上，他数了数一篇占了两版的文章的字数，便用它来做标准。三天，他在极度兴奋的状态中完成了叙述；但他用易看的大而拙劣的字体仔细地抄写好之后，在图书馆借来的一本修辞书上了解到还有段落和引号之类的东西。之前他从没想到过这些东西，便立刻动手重新写，不断地查阅那本修辞书，一天之内学到很多关于写作的知识，比普通学生一年学到的还要多。当他第二次抄写好文章，仔细地把它卷起来之后，又在报纸上读到一则告新手的注意事项，发现一条铁律，那就是手稿不要卷起来而且稿纸不能两面写。这两项他都违背了。他还从这则注意事项中了解到，一流的报纸一个专栏至少付十美元。所以，当他第三次抄写稿子的时候，他便拿十元乘十栏来安慰自己。结果总是一样，一百块，他断定这比出海好多了。如果他没有犯错，他三天就能完成这篇文章。三天一百块！在海上他得花至少三个月的时间才能赚到同样的数目。他得出结论，一个人如果能写作的话还去出海，那他就是傻子，尽管钱对他来说毫无意义。钱的价值就在于它能使他获得自由，能给他买来像样的衣服，所有这一切，可以让他更接近、迅速地接近那修长的、苍白的、曾令他的生活翻转、给了他鼓舞的姑娘。</td>
		<td class="en">Arrived in Oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took up his old room at Bernard Higginbotham’s and set to work.He did not even let Ruth know he was back.He would go and see her when he finished the article on the treasure-hunters.It was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him.Besides, the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to him.He did not know how long an article he should write, but he counted the words in a double-page article in the Sunday supplement of the @San Francisco Examiner@, and guided himself by that.Three days, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks.He had never thought of such things before; and he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring continually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year.When he had copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners, and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written on one side of the paper.He had violated the law on both counts.Also, he learned from the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column.So, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars.The product was always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was better than seafaring.If it hadn’t been for his blunders, he would have finished the article in three days.One hundred dollars in three days!It would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount.A man was a fool to go to sea when he could write, he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him.Its value was in the liberty it would get him, the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer, swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged for a moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever narrower.They had been eating cherries—great, luscious, black cherries with a juice of the color of dark wine.And later, as she read aloud to him from “@The Princess@,” he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips.For the moment her divinity was shattered.She was clay, after all, mere clay, subject to the common law of clay as his clay was subject, or anybody’s clay.Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries dyed them as cherries dyed his.And if so with her lips, then was it so with all of her.She was woman, all woman, just like any woman.It came upon him abruptly.It was a revelation that stunned him.It was as if he had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had seen worshipped purity polluted.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Then he realized the significance of it, and his heart began pounding and challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain.He trembled at the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was singing, and reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right.Something of this change in him must have reached her, for she paused from her reading, looked up at him, and smiled.His eyes dropped from her blue eyes to her lips, and the sight of the stain maddened him.His arms all but flashed out to her and around her, in the way of his old careless life.She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all his will fought to hold him back.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Then she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he looked into her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he felt, he became abashed.He had indeed in thought dared too far.Of all the women he had known there was no woman who would not have guessed—save her.And she had not guessed.There was the difference.She was different.He was appalled by his own grossness, awed by her clear innocence, and he gazed again at her across the gulf.The bridge had broken down.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But still the incident had brought him nearer.The memory of it persisted, and in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt upon it eagerly.The gulf was never again so wide.He had accomplished a distance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts, or a dozen bachelorships.She was pure, it was true, as he had never dreamed of purity; but cherries stained her lips.She was subject to the laws of the universe just as inexorably as he was.She had to eat to live, and when she got her feet wet, she caught cold.But that was not the point.If she could feel hunger and thirst, and heat and cold, then could she feel love—and love for a man.Well, he was a man.And why could he not be the man?“It’s up to me to make good,” he would murmur fervently.“I will be the man.I will make myself the man.I will make good.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">What, in a way, most profoundly impressed Martin, was the correlation of knowledge—of all knowledge.He had been curious to know things, and whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in his brain.Thus, on the subject of sailing he had an immense store.On the subject of woman he had a fairly large store.But these two subjects had been unrelated.Between the two memory compartments there had been no connection.That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible.But Herbert Spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous, but that it was impossible for there to be no connection.All things were related to all other things from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the grain of sand under one’s foot.This new concept was a perpetual amazement to Martin, and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side of the sun.He drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all—kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes, rainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions, illuminating gas, cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and tobacco.Thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it, or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal, but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know.And the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the universe, and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Martin learned to do many things.In the course of the first week, in one afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts.Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure.By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom.As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught them up and “backed” them.This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是件非常累人的活，一个小时接着一个小时，以最快的速度干。旅馆外面宽敞的游廊上，男男女女们穿着凉快的白衣服，啜饮着冰凉的饮料，缓和着血液循环。但洗衣房里空气热得冒烟了。巨大的火炉咆哮着，从赤热到白热，而熨斗在潮湿的衣物上推移着，送出一团团蒸汽。这些熨斗的热度跟家庭主妇们用的可大不相同。用一只湿手指对一个熨斗进行普通测试对于乔和马丁来说太冷了，这种测试也毫无用处。他们全是把熨斗靠近脸颊，凭一种神秘的心灵反应来测定熨斗的温度，这令马丁羡慕却不能了解其中奥妙。当新烧热的熨斗太热的时候，他们便把熨斗挂到铁棒上往冷水里浸一浸。这同样要求有准确而精密的判断。在水里多浸了几分之一秒，合适的温度所产生的微妙细腻的作用便会消失，马丁也惊异于自己训练出的这种精确性——一种自动的精确性，建立在机器般准确无误的标准之上。</td>
		<td class="en">It was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed.Out on the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white, sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down.But in the laundry the air was sizzling.The huge stove roared red hot and white hot, while the irons, moving over the damp cloth, sent up clouds of steam.The heat of these irons was different from that used by housewives.An iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe and Martin, and such test was useless.They went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental process that Martin admired but could not understand.When the fresh irons proved too hot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water.This again required a precise and subtle judgment.A fraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost, and Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed—an automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine-like and unerring.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是他几乎没有时间去惊讶。马丁全部的意识都集中在工作上。无休止地活动，脑和手，一部智能机器，使他成为人的一切，都致力于提供这种智能。他的脑子，已没有空间留给宇宙及宇宙中的重大问题了。他那宽广敞亮的心灵走廊都关上了，并且完全密封了。他灵魂的回声室变成了一个狭小的房间，一个圆锥形的塔，指挥着他的胳膊和肩膀的肌肉，他灵活的十指，以及快速移动的熨斗，大刀阔斧地沿着雾气腾腾的路线推移，就推那么几下，不多一下，每一下就推那么远，半寸也不会多推，沿着那无穷尽的袖子、衣侧、后背和后摆推移，接着把熨好的衬衣抛到承接架上，一点儿都不让它起皱。他那忙乱的灵魂将一件衬衣抛出去的时候，已经在想着第二件衬衣了。他们一直干着，一个钟头接着一个钟头，而外面的整个世界则在加利福尼亚的当头烈日之下热昏过去了。但是在这个高温房间里面没有人热昏。在阳台上凉快的客人们需要干净的衣物。</td>
		<td class="en">But there was little time in which to marvel.All Martin’s consciousness was concentrated in the work.Ceaselessly active, head and hand, an intelligent machine, all that constituted him a man was devoted to furnishing that intelligence.There was no room in his brain for the universe and its mighty problems.All the broad and spacious corridors of his mind were closed and hermetically sealed.The echoing chamber of his soul was a narrow room, a conning tower, whence were directed his arm and shoulder muscles, his ten nimble fingers, and the swift-moving iron along its steaming path in broad, sweeping strokes,just so many strokes and no more, just so far with each stroke and not a fraction of an inch farther, rushing along interminable sleeves, sides, backs, and tails, and tossing the finished shirts, without rumpling, upon the receiving frame.And even as his hurrying soul tossed, it was reaching for another shirt.This went on, hour after hour, while outside all the world swooned under the overhead California sun.But there was no swooning in that superheated room.The cool guests on the verandas needed clean linen.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The sweat poured from Martin.He drank enormous quantities of water, but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores.Always, at sea, except at rare intervals, the work he performed had given him ample opportunity to commune with himself.The master of the ship had been lord of Martin’s time; but here the manager of the hotel was lord of Martin’s thoughts as well.He had no thoughts save for the nerve-racking, body-destroying toil.Outside of that it was impossible to think.He did not know that he loved Ruth.She did not even exist, for his driven soul had no time to remember her.It was only when he crawled to bed at night, or to breakfast in the morning, that she asserted herself to him in fleeting memories.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">On Friday morning the washer ran.Twice a week they had to put through hotel linen,—the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths, and napkins.This finished, they buckled down to “fancy starch.”It was slow work, fastidious and delicate, and Martin did not learn it so readily.Besides, he could not take chances.Mistakes were disastrous.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But Ruth laughed from security.She was sure of herself, and in a few days he would be off to sea.Then, by the time he returned, she would be away on her visit East.There was a magic, however, in the strength and health of Martin.He, too, had been told of her contemplated Eastern trip, and he felt the need for haste.Yet he did not know how to make love to a girl like Ruth.Then, too, he was handicapped by the possession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had been absolutely different from her.They had known about love and life and flirtation, while she knew nothing about such things.Her prodigious innocence appalled him, freezing on his lips all ardors of speech, and convincing him, in spite of himself, of his own unworthiness.Also he was handicapped in another way.He had himself never been in love before.He had liked women in that turgid past of his, and been fascinated by some of them, but he had not known what it was to love them.He had whistled in a masterful, careless way, and they had come to him.They had been diversions, incidents, part of the game men play, but a small part at most.And now, and for the first time, he was a suppliant, tender and timid and doubting.He did not know the way of love, nor its speech, while he was frightened at his loved one’s clear innocence.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on through the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game, he should let the other fellow play first.This had stood him in good stead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well.He knew how to watch the thing that was strange, and to wait for a weakness, for a place of entrance, to divulge itself.It was like sparring for an opening in fist-fighting.And when such an opening came, he knew by long experience to play for it and to play hard.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，他便等待着鲁思，观察着她，想吐露他的爱意却又不敢。他怕吓到她，他对自己也没把握。若是他知道的话，他对她这条路倒是走对了。爱情在表达清楚之前已来到世界上，在少年时期它已学会了自己永不能忘的各种方法与手段。正是以这种古老原始的方法，马丁向鲁思求爱了。开头，他并不知道自己在干这么一回事，后来他明白了。他的手触到她的手比他能说出的任何话语都有力得多，他的气魄对她想象力的冲击比任何书本上的诗歌和千万代情人所说的情话都诱人。凡是他的舌头所能表达的，也许能部分地引起她的兴趣；但是手的接触，那短暂的接触，却能直达她的本能。她的判断力和她一样年轻，但是她的本能却和她的种族一样老成，甚至更老成。当爱情年轻的时候，它们也曾是年轻的，而它们比习俗、观念和一切新生的东西都高明。因此，她的判断力没有起作用。没有必要使用它，马丁不时地唤起她的恋爱本能，而她却没有意识到它的威力。另一方面，他爱她，就像白天一样明白，她有意识地乐于看到他向她表露爱意——闪着温柔光芒的眼睛，颤动的双手，和那晒黑的皮肤下常常暗暗涌现的红潮。她甚至更近了一步，羞怯地挑逗着他，但做得很巧妙，因此他从不曾有过怀疑，又做得在有意无意间，连她也很少怀疑过自己。这些证明了她的力量，宣布她成为了一个女人，这使她激动不已，她折磨他，戏弄他，从中感受到夏娃般的快乐。</td>
		<td class="en">So he waited with Ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but not daring.He was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure of himself.Had he but known it, he was following the right course with her.Love came into the world before articulate speech, and in its own early youth it had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten.It was in this old, primitive way that Martin wooed Ruth.He did not know he was doing it at first, though later he divined it.The touch of his hand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter, the impact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers.Whatever his tongue could express would have appealed, in part, to her judgment; but the touch of hand, the fleeting contact, made its way directly to her instinct.Her judgment was as young as she, but her instincts were as old as the race and older.They had been young when love was young, and they were wiser than convention and opinion and all the new-born things.So her judgment did not act.There was no call upon it, and she did not realize the strength of the appeal Martin made from moment to moment to her love-nature.That he loved her, on the other hand, was as clear as day, and she consciously delighted in beholding his love-manifestations—the glowing eyes with their tender lights, the trembling hands, and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded darkly under his sunburn.She even went farther, in a timid way inciting him, but doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and doing it half-consciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself.She thrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman, and she took an Eve-like delight in tormenting him and playing upon him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于缺乏经验，也因为过于热情，马丁说不出话来，他接着用碰触的方法不知不觉地笨拙地求爱。碰到他的手，她是快乐的，甚至比快乐更怡人。马丁不知道这一点，但他知道她并不反感。不是说除了见面和分别时他们的手常有接触；可是在推脚踏车时，在把那些要带到山上的诗集捆到车上时，在肩并肩品读那些书籍时，他们的手也有机会碰触。而且在他们俯身欣赏书中的佳句时，也有这样的机会，她的发丝拂着他的面颊，肩头碰着肩头。想到那不知从哪儿来的无端的冲动暗示她想要揉乱他的头发，她便暗自笑了；而他则非常渴望，在两人读书读累的时候，把头枕在她的膝上，闭着双眼想象属于他们的未来。过去，在谢尔芒德公园和舒特逊公园周日野餐的时候，他的头曾枕过许多女人的膝，通常，他任性地熟睡了，而那些女孩子为他遮阳，俯身看着他，爱抚他，想知道他为什么那样傲慢地忽视她们对他的爱。把头枕在一个女孩子膝上是世上最容易办到的事情，而现在，现在他发现鲁思的膝头无法接近，也不可能枕到。然而他的谨慎，正是他的追求的力量所在。正是因为谨慎，他从未吓到鲁思。尽管由于她的挑剔和胆怯，她却从未意识到两人交往的危险倾向。她不自不觉地微微向他靠近，越发接近，而他感觉到这日益增加的亲近，渴望冒一次险却又担心。</td>
		<td class="en">Tongue-tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly and awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact.The touch of his hand was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than pleasant.Martin did not know it, but he did know that it was not distasteful to her.Not that they touched hands often, save at meeting and parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the pages of books side by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand.And there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over the beauty of the books.She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while he desired greatly, when they tired of reading, to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs.On Sunday picnics at Shellmound Park and Schuetzen Park, in the past, he had rested his head on many laps, and, usually, he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their love.To rest his head in a girl’s lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now, and now he found Ruth’s lap inaccessible and impossible.Yet it was right here, in his reticence, that the strength of his wooing lay.It was because of this reticence that he never alarmed her.Herself fastidious and timid, she never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse.Subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him, while he, sensing the growing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In his own small room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept house.Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch, was the kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand.The bed, against the rear wall, occupied two-thirds of the total space of the room.The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau, manufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which was shed day by day.This bureau stood in the corner, and in the opposite corner, on the table’s other flank, was the kitchen—the oil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions, and a bucket of water on the floor.Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there being no tap in his room.On days when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous.Over the bed, hoisted by a tackle to the ceiling, was his bicycle.At first he had tried to keep it in the basement; but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires, had driven him out.Next he attempted the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night-long.Then he had retreated with it to his room and slung it aloft.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个小衣橱里装着他的衣服以及他积存起来的书籍，因为无论桌上还是桌下都腾不出放书的空间来。在阅读的同时，他养成了记笔记的习惯。他做了那么多的笔记，要不是他拉起了几根晾衣绳来挂笔记，这狭小的屋子里就没有他可容身的空间了。即便如此，屋里还是挤得连他穿行走动都十分困难。不先关上衣橱门他就没法打开房门，反过来也是一样。无论如何他要直线穿过房间是完全不可能的。从房门走到床头是一条弯来折去的路线，他从来都做不到在黑暗里走完这条路线而不发生碰撞。解决了门扇间相互碰撞的难题后，他必须急转向右绕开厨房。接着，他又转向左边以避开床脚，但是这一转若转得幅度太大又会撞上桌角。倏地一倾一倒，他终止了拐弯，躺在一个有点像运河结构的右侧。“运河”的一岸是床，另一岸是桌子。当房间里仅有的一张椅子放在桌前通常放的地方时，这“运河”根本不能通航。椅子不用的时候就置在床上，尽管做饭的时候，他偶尔也坐到椅子上——一边看书一边煮开水。他甚至变得有技巧到能够一边煎牛排一边写下一两个段落。再者，构成厨房的那个小角落是那么狭窄，他能够坐着就伸手拿到任何他想要的东西。事实上，坐着做饭反而方便；站起来时，他总是自己碍着自己的道。</td>
		<td class="en">A small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated and for which there was no room on the table or under the table.Hand in hand with reading, he had developed the habit of making notes, and so copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence for him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several clothes-lines across the room on which the notes were hung.Even so, he was crowded until navigating the room was a difficult task.He could not open the door without first closing the closet door, and vice versa.It was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the room in a straight line.To go from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag course that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without collisions.Having settled the difficulty of the conflicting doors, he had to steer sharply to the right to avoid the kitchen.Next, he sheered to the left, to escape the foot of the bed; but this sheer, if too generous, brought him against the corner of the table.With a sudden twitch and lurch, he terminated the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal, one bank of which was the bed, the other the table.When the one chair in the room was at its usual place before the table, the canal was unnavigable.When the chair was not in use, it reposed on top of the bed, though sometimes he sat on the chair when cooking, reading a book while the water boiled, and even becoming skilful enough to manage a paragraph or two while steak was frying.Also, so small was the little corner that constituted the kitchen, he was able, sitting down, to reach anything he needed.In fact, it was expedient to cook sitting down; standing up, he was too often in his own way.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He went farther in the matter.Reading the works of men who had arrived, he noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the tricks by which they had been achieved—the tricks of narrative, of exposition, of style, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams; and of all these he made lists for study.He did not ape.He sought principles.He drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms, till out of many such, culled from many writers, he was able to induce the general principle of mannerism, and, thus equipped, to cast about for new and original ones of his own, and to weigh and measure and appraise them properly.In similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases, the phrases of living language, phrases that bit like acid and scorched like flame, or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of the arid desert of common speech.He sought always for the principle that lay behind and beneath.He wanted to know how the thing was done; after that he could do it for himself.He was not content with the fair face of beauty.He dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory, where cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe; and, having dissected and learned the anatomy of beauty, he was nearer being able to create beauty itself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他有这样的天性，以至于他只能在理解的前提下才能动手去做。他不能在黑暗中盲目工作，不知道自己在创造什么，把创作结果的好坏对错交托给运气和自己的天才福星。他对投机得到的结果没有耐心。他想要知道为什么和怎么做。他靠的是谨慎而富有创造力的天才，在他开始写故事或诗歌之前，故事或诗歌本身就已经存在于他的脑海之中了。他看得到结尾，而且实现那个结尾的方法也已经在他意识掌控之中。若非如此，那些努力是注定要失败的。另一方面，他欣赏单词之间、短语之间偶然出现的效果，它们轻盈自在地进入他脑子里，后来经受住了所有美和力的考验，发展出极多难以言传的隐含意义。面对这些，他俯首弯腰，惊讶万分。他知道任何人的精心创作都创造不出这些。他寻找那些藏在美的深处，使美成为可能的原理。然而，无论在此过程中他对美有怎样深入的剖析，他始终意识到美最深处的奥秘是他所无法参透的，也没有哪一个前人参透过它。他从斯宾塞的作品里充分地了解到，人永远都不能获得任何一件事物的终极知识，美的奥秘并不亚于生命的奥秘——不，美和生命两者的纤维往往是互相交织在一起的，而他自己不过是这一团无法领悟的纤维中的一小撮而已。</td>
		<td class="en">He was so made that he could work only with understanding.He could not work blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing and trusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced should be right and fine.He had no patience with chance effects.He wanted to know why and how.His was deliberate creative genius, and, before he began a story or poem, the thing itself was already alive in his brain, with the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in his conscious possession.Otherwise the effort was doomed to failure.On the other hand, he appreciated the chance effects in words and phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain, and that later stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable connotations.Before such he bowed down and marvelled, knowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of any man.And no matter how much he dissected beauty in search of the principles that underlie beauty and make beauty possible, he was aware, always, of the innermost mystery of beauty to which he did not penetrate and to which no man had ever penetrated.He knew full well, from his Spencer, that man can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything, and that the mystery of beauty was no less than that of life—nay, more that the fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted, and that he himself was but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric, twisted of sunshine and star-dust and wonder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其实，就是带着这样的思索他写了一篇题为《星尘》的文章，里头他激情澎湃地表达了对那些重要批评家的指摘，而不是对批评原理的指摘。这篇文章写得才华横溢、深刻透彻、富有哲理，而且巧妙地融入了幽默诙谐的元素。跟往常一样，文章一寄出去就立刻被各个杂志社退回来了。但他已经想清楚了这一切，他要从容地走自己的路。他养成了一个习惯，就一个主题先酝酿思考，等自己想法成熟之后再冲到打字机前把它一口气写出来。这一作品没能见报的事实他并没有太在意。这篇文章是长期思考过程的最终成果，是散乱思想线索的整合，是深埋在他脑海里的所有资料的最后归纳。写下这样一篇文章是他有意识的努力。通过这样的努力，他解放了自己的思想，使它准备好去接受新鲜的材料和问题。这跟那些男人女人一种普遍的习惯很相似。他们被真实或假想的悲伤所困扰，定期打破他们沉默，滔滔不绝地倾吐长期以来所遭受的痛苦，“发表他们的言论”，直到说完最后一个字。</td>
		<td class="en">In fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay entitled “Star-dust,” in which he had his fling, not at the principles of criticism, but at the principal critics.It was brilliant, deep, philosophical, and deliciously touched with laughter.Also it was promptly rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted.But having cleared his mind of it, he went serenely on his way.It was a habit he developed, of incubating and maturing his thought upon a subject, and of then rushing into the type-writer with it.That it did not see print was a matter a small moment with him.The writing of it was the culminating act of a long mental process, the drawing together of scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the data with which his mind was burdened.To write such an article was the conscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh material and problems.It was in a way akin to that common habit of men and women troubled by real or fancied grievances, who periodically and volubly break their long-suffering silence and “have their say” till the last word is said.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Having learned such precautions, Martin consulted “The Duchess” for tone, and proceeded to mix according to formula.The formula consists of three parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed or event they are reunited; (3) marriage bells.The third part was an unvarying quantity, but the first and second parts could be varied an infinite number of times.Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so forth and so forth;they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming relative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl’s heart, by lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly.It was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being reunited, and Martin discovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses.But marriage bells at the end was the one thing he could take no liberties with; though the heavens rolled up as a scroll and the stars fell, the wedding bells must go on ringing just the same.In quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose, fifteen hundred words maximum dose.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to Brissenden’s advice and command. @The Shame of the Sun@ he wrapped and mailed to @The Acropolis@.He believed he could find magazine publication for it, and he felt that recognition by the magazines would commend him to the book-publishing houses.“Ephemera” he likewise wrapped and mailed to a magazine.Despite Brissenden’s prejudice against the magazines, which was a pronounced mania with him, Martin decided that the great poem should see print.He did not intend, however, to publish it without the other’s permission.His plan was to get it accepted by one of the high magazines, and, thus armed, again to wrestle with Brissenden for consent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从那天早上起，马丁开始创作起另一篇小说，那小说早在几星期前就有了雏形，并不断喧闹着要他创作出来，一直令他心烦。显然这篇小说将是一个出彩的航海故事，充满了二十世纪的冒险主义和浪漫精神，描绘着真实世界里真实条件下的真实人物。但是跌宕起伏的故事之下还隐藏着另外的东西——一方面，肤浅的读者体会不到这些含义，另一方面却丝毫不会减少他们对作品的兴趣和喜爱。正是这些东西，而不仅仅是故事本身，促使马丁创作这篇小说。就此而言，总是那些伟大而普遍的主题给他提供情节灵感。找到了这样的主题后，他便开始揣摩设定独特的人物和独特的环境，以及用来表达那具有普遍意义的东西的时间和地点。他决定把这篇小说命名为《过期》，他相信这部小说将不会超过六万字——对于他旺盛的创作精力而言，这不过是小菜一碟。第一天，他为自己写作时的得心应手感到高兴。他不再担心自己尖锐锋利的棱角会溜出来毁坏作品了。经过长达数月的紧张实践和研究，他已经获得了回报。他现在已经能老练地专注于从事自己规划的事情的大方面了。他创作着，一个小时接一个小时。他前所未有地觉得自己对生命和生命中的事物有了无限确定的认识。《过期》所描写的故事对于它特有的角色和事件而言将会显得真实，但马丁有信心它也能描述出对于一切时代、一切海洋和一切生活都真实、伟大而重要的东西——这多亏了赫伯特·斯宾塞，他一边想着，一边把身子往桌子后靠了一会儿。是的，多亏了赫伯特·斯宾塞，是他把进化论这把生存的万能钥匙放到了马丁手中。 </td>
		<td class="en">Martin began, that morning, a story which he had sketched out a number of weeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its insistent clamor to be created.Apparently it was to be a rattling sea story, a tale of twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling real characters, in a real world, under real conditions.But beneath the swing and go of the story was to be something else—something that the superficial reader would never discern and which, on the other hand, would not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a reader.It was this, and not the mere story, that impelled Martin to write it.For that matter, it was always the great, universal motif that suggested plots to him.After having found such a motif, he cast about for the particular persons and particular location in time and space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing. @Overdue@ was the title he had decided for it, and its length he believed would not be more than sixty thousand words—a bagatelle for him with his splendid vigor of production.On this first day he took hold of it with conscious delight in the mastery of his tools.He no longer worried for fear that the sharp, cutting edges should slip and mar his work.The long months of intense application and study had brought their reward.He could now devote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the thing he shaped; and as he worked, hour after hour, he felt, as never before, the sure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the affairs of life. @Overdue@ would tell a story that would be true of its particular characters and its particular events; but it would tell, too, he was confident, great vital things that would be true of all time, and all sea, and all life—thanks to Herbert Spencer, he thought, leaning back for a moment from the table.Ay, thanks to Herbert Spencer and to the master-key of life, evolution, which Spencer had placed in his hands.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他意识到自己正在创作着伟大的作品。“它会成功的！它会成功的！”这句话不断地在他脑海中回响。</td>
		<td class="en">He was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing.“It will go!It will go!” was the refrain that kept, sounding in his ears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它当然会成功。他终于要创作出各个杂志争先抢后想要的作品了。整个故事如闪电般在他眼前展现开来。他暂时放下这个念头，留足时间先在笔记本里写下了一段话。这段话后来成为了《过期》的最后一段。可整本书的构思已经在他的脑海里完成了，早在他写到结局的前几个星期，这部作品本身就已经在他脑中结尾了。他把最后尚未完成的故事与其他海洋作家的故事进行比较，觉得自己的故事比别人的不知要强过多少倍。“只有一个人能够与它媲美，”他大声地喃喃自语道，“那人就是康拉德。这书甚至能让康拉德吃惊，和我握手，并对我说：‘马丁，我的孩子，写得好！’”</td>
		<td class="en">Of course it would go.At last he was turning out the thing at which the magazines would jump.The whole story worked out before him in lightning flashes.He broke off from it long enough to write a paragraph in his note-book.This would be the last paragraph in @Overdue@; but so thoroughly was the whole book already composed in his brain that he could write, weeks before he had arrived at the end, the end itself.He compared the tale, as yet unwritten, with the tales of the sea-writers, and he felt it to be immeasurably superior.“There’s only one man who could touch it,” he murmured aloud, “and that’s Conrad.And it ought to make even him sit up and shake hands with me, and say, ‘Well done, Martin, my boy.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他辛苦地写了一整天，最后一刻忽然想起还要去莫尔斯家参加晚宴。多亏了布里森登，他的黑色礼服才能从当铺里赎出来。现在他又有资格参加宴会了。进城之后，他跑进图书馆花了很长一些时间找到了萨里比的书籍。他找出那本《生命周期》，并在车上读起了诺顿提到的那篇批判斯宾塞的文章。马丁一边读着,一边忍不住怒从中来。他的脸变得通红，牙关紧咬，拳头不自觉地攥了起来，刚松开，又攥了起来，仿佛在紧捏着什么令人厌恶的东西，恨不得把它捏死。下车后，他就像一个怒汉一样在人行道上大踏步地走着，直到恶狠狠地按响了莫尔斯家的门铃时，他才猛然意识到自己的行为好笑，不禁莞尔，顿时心情好转，。但当他一进门，一股强大的抑郁感却突然笼罩了他。他一下子从高空跌落，而那天一整天他都乘着灵感的翅膀在高空中飞翔。“中产阶级者”、“市侩老巢”——布里森登极具讽刺意味的词语在他的脑海里一再闪现。但是那又怎样？他愤怒地责问道。他要娶的人是鲁思，不是她的家人。</td>
		<td class="en">He toiled on all day, recollecting, at the last moment, that he was to have dinner at the Morses’.Thanks to Brissenden, his black suit was out of pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties.Down town he stopped off long enough to run into the library and search for Saleeby’s books.He drew out @The Cycle of Life@, and on the car turned to the essay Norton had mentioned on Spencer.As Martin read, he grew angry.His face flushed, his jaw set, and unconsciously his hand clenched, unclenched, and clenched again as if he were taking fresh grips upon some hateful thing out of which he was squeezing the life.When he left the car, he strode along the sidewalk as a wrathful man will stride, and he rang the Morse bell with such viciousness that it roused him to consciousness of his condition, so that he entered in good nature, smiling with amusement at himself.No sooner, however, was he inside than a great depression descended upon him.He fell from the height where he had been up-borne all day on the wings of inspiration.“Bourgeois,” “trader’s den”—Brissenden’s epithets repeated themselves in his mind.But what of that? he demanded angrily.He was marrying Ruth, not her family.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他仿佛觉得鲁思从没有这么美丽，这么超凡脱俗，这么空灵动人，同时又这么健康过。她两颊嫣红，双眼一次又一次地吸引着他的目光——那双眼睛让他第一次读到了永恒。最近他已经忘记了永恒，他读的科学著作把他带离了永恒。然而在这里，在鲁思的眼睛里，他读到了一种凌驾于一切言语论证之上的、无法用词汇表达的理论。他看见一切辩论都在她眼前仓皇而逃，因为他在那里看见了爱情。他自己的眼里也溢满了爱情，而爱情是不需要回答的。那就是他激情的信条。</td>
		<td class="en">It seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful, more spiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy.There was color in her cheeks, and her eyes drew him again and again—the eyes in which he had first read immortality.He had forgotten immortality of late, and the trend of his scientific reading had been away from it; but here, in Ruth’s eyes, he read an argument without words that transcended all worded arguments.He saw that in her eyes before which all discussion fled away, for he saw love there.And in his own eyes was love; and love was unanswerable.Such was his passionate doctrine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在进去用餐前与鲁思一同度过的半个小时里，他觉得无比幸福，对生活感到无比满足。然而一到餐桌上，一天的辛苦工作所带来的不可避免的反应和疲惫感却紧紧地左右着他。他意识到自己目光怠倦，心情烦躁不安。他还记得当初正是在这张桌子旁，他第一次与文明人一同用餐，当时还自以为那就是高雅、高尚的生活氛围。可现在他却对它嗤之以鼻，时常觉得十分无趣。他眼前浮现出了他当时那可悲的模样，那是很久以前的事了——一个忸怩的粗汉，在忧惧痛苦中浑身的毛孔都冒着汗，为餐桌上的繁文缛节弄得不知所措，受着如魔鬼一般的侍者的折磨，竭尽全力想要攀上这个让人头晕眼花的上层社会，到最后却决定坦诚地做自己，绝不卖弄风雅，不懂装懂。</td>
		<td class="en">The half hour he had with her, before they went in to dinner, left him supremely happy and supremely satisfied with life.Nevertheless, at table, the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard day seized hold of him.He was aware that his eyes were tired and that he was irritable.He remembered it was at this table, at which he now sneered and was so often bored, that he had first eaten with civilized beings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high culture and refinement.He caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure of him, so long ago, a self-conscious savage, sprouting sweat at every pore in an agony of apprehension, puzzled by the bewildering minutiae of eating-implements, tortured by the ogre of a servant, striving at a leap to live at such dizzy social altitude, and deciding in the end to be frankly himself, pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not possess.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他瞥了鲁思一眼以寻求慰藉，正像个突然害怕沉船，急于寻找救生衣的乘客一样。是的，他已经有所收获了——他得到了爱情和鲁思。其他的一切都没有经受住书本的考验。但是鲁思和爱情却通过了考验，他还为此找到了生物学上的支持理论。爱情是生命最崇高的表达方式。为了爱情，大自然一直忙于设计着他，也忙着设计着所有正常的人。为了这一任务，大自然已经花了上万个世纪——咳，上十万乃至上百万个世纪——而他则是大自然的最佳杰作。大自然让爱情成为他生命中最强大的东西，赐予了他想象力，把爱情的力量无限放大，让他在短暂的一生里结伴、狂欢、融化。他的手在桌子底下摸索着身旁的鲁思的手，一股浓浓的暖意在两人的手上传递着。她匆匆看了他一眼，眼里洋溢着幸福和柔情。他的眼中也流露着一样的神情，一阵激动遍及全身。他还不知道鲁思眼中的幸福与柔情有多少是被她看见的他的眼神所唤起的。</td>
		<td class="en">He glanced at Ruth for reassurance, much in the same manner that a passenger, with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck, will strive to locate the life preservers.Well, that much had come out of it—love and Ruth.All the rest had failed to stand the test of the books.But Ruth and love had stood the test; for them he found a biological sanction.Love was the most exalted expression of life.Nature had been busy designing him, as she had been busy with all normal men, for the purpose of loving.She had spent ten thousand centuries—ay, a hundred thousand and a million centuries—upon the task, and he was the best she could do.She had made love the strongest thing in him, increased its power a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination, and sent him forth into the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate.His hand sought Ruth’s hand beside him hidden by the table, and a warm pressure was given and received.She looked at him a swift instant, and her eyes were radiant and melting.So were his in the thrill that pervaded him; nor did he realize how much that was radiant and melting in her eyes had been aroused by what she had seen in his.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马丁的桌子斜对面，莫尔斯先生的右侧，坐着当地高级法院的布朗特法官。马丁见过他几面，却对他没什么好感。法官正和鲁思的父亲讨论工会政治、当地局势和社会主义。莫尔斯先生正企图就社会主义的问题挖苦马丁一番。布朗特法官终于带着父亲般的慈爱和怜悯望着对桌的马丁。马丁暗自好笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Across the table from him, cater-cornered, at Mr. Morse’s right, sat Judge Blount, a local superior court judge.Martin had met him a number of times and had failed to like him.He and Ruth’s father were discussing labor union politics, the local situation, and socialism, and Mr. Morse was endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter topic.At last Judge Blount looked across the table with benignant and fatherly pity.Martin smiled to himself.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was Sunday night, and they found the small hall packed by the Oakland socialists, chiefly members of the working class.The speaker, a clever Jew, won Martin’s admiration at the same time that he aroused his antagonism.The man’s stooped and narrow shoulders and weazened chest proclaimed him the true child of the crowded ghetto, and strong on Martin was the age-long struggle of the feeble, wretched slaves against the lordly handful of men who had ruled over them and would rule over them to the end of time.To Martin this withered wisp of a creature was a symbol.He was the figure that stood forth representative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings and inefficients who perished according to biological law on the ragged confines of life.They were the unfit.In spite of their cunning philosophy and of their antlike proclivities for cooperation, Nature rejected them for the exceptional man.Out of the plentiful spawn of life she flung from her prolific hand she selected only the best.It was by the same method that men, aping her, bred race-horses and cucumbers.Doubtless, a creator of a Cosmos could have devised a better method; but creatures of this particular Cosmos must put up with this particular method.Of course, they could squirm as they perished, as the socialists squirmed, as the speaker on the platform and the perspiring crowd were squirming even now as they counselled together for some new device with which to minimize the penalties of living and outwit the Cosmos.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The cub had been industrious.He had scurried around and nosed out Martin’s family history, and procured a photograph of Higginbotham’s Cash Store with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out in front.That gentleman was depicted as an intelligent, dignified businessman who had no patience with his brother-in-law’s socialistic views, and no patience with the brother-in-law, either, whom he was quoted as characterizing as a lazy good-for-nothing who wouldn’t take a job when it was offered to him and who would go to jail yet.Hermann Von Schmidt, Marian’s husband, had likewise been interviewed.He had called Martin the black sheep of the family and repudiated him.“He tried to sponge off of me, but I put a stop to that good and quick,” Von Schmidt had said to the reporter.“He knows better than to come bumming around here.A man who won’t work is no good, take that from me.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was not a passionate letter.There were no touches of anger in it.But all the way through, from the first sentence to the last, was sounded the note of hurt and disappointment.She had expected better of him.She had thought he had got over his youthful wildness, that her love for him had been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live seriously and decently.And now her father and mother had taken a firm stand and commanded that the engagement be broken.That they were justified in this she could not but admit.Their relation could never be a happy one.It had been unfortunate from the first.But one regret she voiced in the whole letter, and it was a bitter one to Martin.“If only you had settled down to some position and attempted to make something of yourself,” she wrote.“But it was not to be.Your past life had been too wild and irregular.I can understand that you are not to be blamed.You could act only according to your nature and your early training.So I do not blame you, Martin.Please remember that. It was simply a mistake.As father and mother have contended, we were not made for each other, and we should both be happy because it was discovered not too late.”… “There is no use trying to see me,” she said toward the last.“It would be an unhappy meeting for both of us, as well as for my mother.I feel, as it is, that I have caused her great pain and worry.I shall have to do much living to atone for it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又从头到尾把信认真看了一遍，然后坐下来写回信。他概括了一下他在那次社会主义聚会上的发言，指出他所说的话和报纸上所写的全然不同。在信的结尾，他又变身成了上帝的情人，激情四溢地表白爱情。“请回复我，”他说，“在你的回信中就告诉我一件事。你爱我么？就这一个问题，回答这一个问题就够了。”</td>
		<td class="en">He read it through to the end, carefully, a second time, then sat down and replied.He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist meeting, pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what the newspaper had put in his mouth.Toward the end of the letter he was God’s own lover pleading passionately for love.“Please answer,” he said, “and in your answer you have to tell me but one thing.Do you love me?That is all—the answer to that one question.”</td></tr>

Deeper and deeper he went.His eyes were open, and he watched the ghostly, phosphorescent trails of the darting bonita.As he swam, he hoped that they would not strike at him, for it might snap the tension of his will.But they did not strike, and he found time to be grateful for this last kindness of life.</td></tr>

There was a long rumble of sound, and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast and interminable stairway.
