		<td class="en">繁茂的开花植物开满红色和黄色的花，将参天大树彼此链接起来，为猴子们提供了一个极好的隐藏处。猴子们一直躲在里面，等到一头美洲狮或是一头大象经过，就跳到它们背上去兜风，玩够了就攀上匍匐植物，摇荡开去。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">鲸鱼拉着骨头的一端，大象拉着另一端，俩人谁也不知道自己的对手其实并不是乌龟。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">鲸鱼力气大的时候，大象就被拖入水中，而当大象力气大的时候，鲸鱼就被拖到岸上来。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At last they were quite tired, and the tortoise, who was watching, saw that they could play no more.</td>
		<td class="en">最后两方都筋疲力尽。乌龟一直观察着，看到两方都无法再比下去了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So he crept from his hiding-place, and dipping himself in the river, he went to the elephant and said: ‘I see that you really are stronger than I thought.</td>
		<td class="en">于是乌龟从灌木丛中慢悠悠地爬出来，在河里泡了泡，来到大象身边说：“我发现你真的比我想象中的要强。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Suppose we give it up for to-day?’</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >A day or two later the young tortoise was taking a stroll, when he met a fox, and stopped to speak to him.</td>
		<td class="en">一两天后，年轻的乌龟正在散步，看到一只狐狸，就停下来和它说话。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Let us try,’ said he in a careless manner, ‘which of us can lie buried in the ground during seven years.’</td>
		<td class="en">“让我们来比一比，”乌龟漫不经心地说道，“看谁能在地里埋上七年。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘I shall be delighted,’ answered the fox, ‘only I would rather that you began.’</td>
		<td class="en">“我会很乐意的，”狐狸回答说，“只不过我希望你先开始。”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“对我来说都一样，”乌龟回道，“明天你来的时候，就会看到我已经完成我的任务了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So he looked about for a suitable place, and found a convenient hole at the foot of an orange tree.</td>
		<td class="en">于是乌龟四下看了看，想找个合适的地方，然后在一棵橘子树下发现了一个十分方便的洞。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He crept into it, and the next morning the fox heaped up the earth round him, and promised to feed him every day with fresh fruit.</td>
		<td class="en">乌龟爬进了洞里。第二天早晨，狐狸将土堆在乌龟身上，并答应每天给乌龟送新鲜水果吃。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The fox so far kept his word that each morning when the sun rose he appeared to ask how the tortoise was getting on.</td>
		<td class="en">狐狸一直遵守着诺言，每天早上太阳升起的时候，他就会露面问一问乌龟过得怎样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Oh, very well; but I wish you would give me some fruit,’ replied he.</td>
		<td class="en">“哦，很好，但是我希望你会给我一些水果。”乌龟答道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Alas! the fruit is not ripe enough yet for you to eat,’ answered the fox, who hoped that the tortoise would die of hunger long before the seven years were over.</td>
		<td class="en">“唉！现在水果不太成熟，还不能吃。”狐狸回答说。它希望乌龟在这七年结束之前早一点儿饿死。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Oh dear, oh dear!</td>
		<td class="en">“哎呀，哎呀！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I am so hungry!’ cried the tortoise.</td>
		<td class="en">我好饿呀！”乌龟叫喊道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘I am sure you must be; but it will be all right to-morrow,’ said the fox, trotting off, not knowing that the oranges dropped down the hollow trunk, straight into the tortoise’s hole, and that he had as many as he could possibly eat.</td>
		<td class="en">“我知道你肯定很饿，但是明天就会好了。”狐狸说着，慢慢跑开了。它不知道那根中空树干上的橘子落了下来，正好掉进了乌龟所在的洞里，并且是要多少就有多少。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So the seven years went by; and when the tortoise came out of his hole he was as fat as ever.</td>
		<td class="en">就这样，七年过去了，乌龟从洞里出来的时候还跟先前一样胖。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Now it was the fox’s turn, and he chose his hole, and the tortoise heaped the earth round, promising to return every day or two with a nice young bird for his dinner.</td>
		<td class="en">现在轮到狐狸了，它选好了自己的洞，然后乌龟把土堆在狐狸身上，并答应每隔一两天就会给狐狸带一只美味的小鸟来当晚餐。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Well, how are you getting on?’ he would ask cheerfully when he paid his visits.</td>
		<td class="en">“你过得怎样？”每次来访的时候，乌龟都会高兴地问道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Oh, all right; only I wish you had brought a bird with you,’ answered the fox.</td>
		<td class="en">“哦，还行，只是我希望你带了一只鸟儿来。”狐狸回答说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘I have been so unlucky, I have never been able to catch one,’ replied the tortoise.</td>
		<td class="en">“我真是太不走运了，一只鸟儿也没捉到。”乌龟答道，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘However, I shall be more fortunate to-morrow, I am sure.’</td>
		<td class="en">“但是，明天我会幸运一点儿的，我敢肯定。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But not many to-morrows after, when the tortoise arrived with his usual question: ‘Well, how are you getting on?’ he received no answer, for the fox was lying in his hole quite still, dead of hunger.</td>
		<td class="en">但是没过几天，乌龟过来像往常一样问道：“你过得怎样？”他却没有听到回答，因为狐狸静静地躺在洞里，饿死了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >By this time the tortoise was grown up, and was looked up to throughout the forest as a person to be feared for his strength and wisdom.</td>
		<td class="en">到这时，乌龟已经长大了，森林里的每个动物都对它的力量与智慧深感敬畏。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But he was not considered a very swift runner, until an adventure with a deer added to his fame.</td>
		<td class="en">只不过没有人认为它是一个跑步健将，直到与鹿的一次比拼才让它名声大振。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >One day, when he was basking in the sun, a stag passed by, and stopped for a little conversation.</td>
		<td class="en">一天，乌龟正在晒太阳，一只牡鹿经过，停下来和它搭讪。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Would you care to see which of us can run fastest?’ asked the tortoise, after some talk.</td>
		<td class="en">“你愿不愿意跟我比比，看谁跑得快？”谈了一会儿之后，乌龟问道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The stag thought the question so silly that he only shrugged his shoulders.</td>
		<td class="en">牡鹿认为这个问题太愚蠢，所以只是耸了耸肩。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Of course, the victor would have the right to kill the other,’ went on the tortoise.</td>
		<td class="en">“当然，胜出的一方将有权杀死另一方。”乌龟继续说道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Oh, on that condition I agree,’ answered the deer; ‘but I am afraid you are a dead man.’</td>
		<td class="en">“哦，如果是那样，我同意，”牡鹿回答说，“但是我恐怕死的是你。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘It is no use trying to frighten me,’ replied the tortoise.</td>
		<td class="en">“想要吓唬我，一点儿用都没有，”乌龟回答说，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘But I should like three days for training; then I shall be ready to start when the sun strikes on the big tree at the edge of the great clearing.’</td>
		<td class="en">“但是我想要三天的时间来训练一下。等到太阳照到这大片空地边上那棵大树上的时候，我就会准备好开始了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The first thing the tortoise did was to call his brothers and his cousins together, and he posted them carefully under ferns all along the line of the great clearing, making a sort of ladder which stretched for many miles.</td>
		<td class="en">乌龟做的第一件事就是将它的兄弟及表兄弟们叫到一起，然后小心地将它们沿途安置在空地周围的篱笆下，排成类似梯子的样式，队伍绵延几英里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This done to his satisfaction, he went back to the starting place.</td>
		<td class="en">心满意足之后，乌龟回到起跑的地方。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The stag was quite punctual, and as soon as the sun’s rays struck the trunk of the tree the stag started off, and was soon far out of the sight of the tortoise.</td>
		<td class="en">牡鹿相当准时，阳光一照到树干上，就开始跑了，并且很快就跑出了乌龟的视线。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Every now and then he would turn his head as he ran, and call out: ‘How are you getting on?’ and the tortoise who happened to be nearest at that moment would answer: ‘All right, I am close up to you.’</td>
		<td class="en">牡鹿跑的时候，总是时不时地转过头大喊：“你怎么样了？”而那时，正巧相隔最近的乌龟就会回答说：“很好，我离你很近。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Full of astonishment, the stag would redouble his efforts, but it was no use.</td>
		<td class="en">牡鹿大吃一惊，于是加倍努力，可是一点儿用也没有。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Each time he asked: ‘Are you there?’ the answer would come: ‘Yes, of course, where else should I be?’</td>
		<td class="en">每次它问：“你在那儿吗？”回答就会是：“是的，当然在，不然我该在哪儿？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" > And the stag ran, and ran, and ran, till he could run no more, and dropped down dead on the grass.</td>
		<td class="en">牡鹿跑啊，跑啊，跑啊，一直跑到再也跑不动，然后倒在草地上死掉了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And the tortoise, when he thinks about it, laughs still.</td>
		<td class="en">那只乌龟每念及此，仍会大笑不已。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the tortoise was not the only creature of whose tricks stories were told in the forest.</td>
		<td class="en">但是森林里流传着的那些关于玩把戏的故事里，主角并不全是这只乌龟。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There was a famous monkey who was just as clever and more mischievous, because he was so much quicker on his feet and with his hands.</td>
		<td class="en">还有一只有名的猴子，它和乌龟一样聪明，因为手脚相当敏捷，所以也更加淘气。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was quite impossible to catch him and give him the thrashing he so often deserved, for he just swung himself up into a tree and laughed at the angry victim who was sitting below.</td>
		<td class="en">要抓住它，并给它应有的鞭打，实在不太可能，因为它会恰巧荡进树里，嘲笑坐在树下怒气冲冲的受害者。</td></tr>
