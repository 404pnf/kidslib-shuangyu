		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我刚来这里“落户”,最先注意到我的是一位自称是估税员、在美国“国内税务部门”任职的绅士。我说虽然我之前从没听说过他从事的工作，但还是很高兴认识他。他会进来坐吗？他就了座。我不知道要和他聊点什么好，但我觉得已经成家立业的人必须健谈，必须显得随和善于社交。因此，一时找不到别的可聊，我就问他是不是在我们这附近开店。</td>
		<td class="en">The first notice that was taken of me when I “settled down” recently was by a gentleman who said he was an assessor, and connected with the U. S. Internal Revenue Department.I said I had never heard of his branch of business before, but I was very glad to see him all the same.Would he sit down?He sat down.I did not know anything particular to say, and yet I felt that people who have arrived at the dignity of keeping house must be conversational, must be easy and sociable in company.So, in default of anything else to say, I asked him if he was opening his shop in our neighborhood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他说是的。（我不想显得无知，但我原指望他会谈谈他做的是什么买卖。）</td>
		<td class="en">He said he was.[I did not wish to appear ignorant, but I had hoped he would mention what he had for sale.]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我试着问他：“生意还好吧？”他说：“马马虎虎吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">I ventured to ask him “How was trade?”And he said “So-so.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我接着说我们会登门拜访，如果也和别人一样喜欢他的店，我们会成为他的主顾的。</td>
		<td class="en">I then said we would drop in, and if we liked his house as well as any other, we would give him our custom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他说他认为我们一定会喜欢他的店，以后还会非他的店不去——还说他从没见过一个和他打过一次交道的人会离开他那里，去找和他同行的其他人做生意。</td>
		<td class="en">He said he thought we would like his establishment well enough to confine ourselves to it—said he never saw anybody who would go off and hunt up another man in his line after trading with him once.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这话听起来相当自夸，我们每个人都会自然流露出一种虚伪，除去这点，这人看上去还挺诚实的。</td>
		<td class="en">That sounded pretty complacent, but barring that natural expression of villainy which we all have, the man looked honest enough.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我也记不清到底是怎么回事，反正后来气氛越来越融洽，我和他也越聊越投机，随后，一切都变得顺理成章。</td>
		<td class="en">I do not know how it came about exactly, but gradually we appeared to melt down and run together, conversationally speaking, and then everything went along as comfortably as clockwork.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们聊啊，聊啊，聊——最起码我是这样；我们笑呀，笑呀，笑——至少他是这样。不过我一直保持着清醒的头脑——我那与生俱来的警惕性，套用工程师的一句行话，叫“开足了马力”。不管他怎么模棱两可地回答我，我下定决心要把他的工作弄个一清二楚，而且我还决定我要让他在不猜疑我的用意的情况下把话套出来。我想用一个巧妙的计策将他带入圈套。我要告诉他我工作的全部事情，那他自然会对我放下戒备，看我对他这样信任，他会自信满满以至忘乎所以，告诉我他的全部事情，还不会怀疑我的意图。我心里暗想，小子啊，你还不知道和你是在和一只老狐狸打交道吧！我说：</td>
		<td class="en">We talked, and talked, and talked—at least I did; and we laughed, and laughed, and laughed—at least he did.But all the time I had my presence of mind about me—I had my native shrewdness turned on “full head,” as the engineers say.I was determined to find out all about his business in spite of his obscure answers—and I was determined I would have it out of him without his suspecting what I was at.I meant to trap him with a deep, deep ruse.I would tell him all about my own business, and he would naturally so warm to me during this seductive burst of confidence that he would forget himself, and tell me all about his affairs before he suspected what I was about.I thought to myself, My son, you little know what an old fox you are dealing with.I said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您瞧，您绝对想不到我这个冬天和上个春天演讲赚了多少钱吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now you never would guess what I made lecturing this winter and last spring?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊——我相信我猜不到，饶了我吧。让我想想——再想想。大概2000美元，可能吧？不过不是，不是，先生，我知道您不可能赚那么多。就猜1700，可能吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“No—don’t believe I could, to save me.Let me see—let me see.About two thousand dollars, maybe?But no; no, sir, I know you couldn’t have made that much.Say seventeen hundred, maybe?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈哈！我就知道您猜不出来。我上个春天和这个冬天的演讲收入是14750块。您觉得我这个收入怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ha! Ha!I knew you couldn’t.My lecturing receipts for last spring and this winter were fourteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.What do you think of that?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，不可思议——太不可思议了。我可得记下来。您说这还不是全部？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, it is amazing—perfectly amazing.I will make a note of it.And you say even this wasn’t all?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“全部！上帝保佑您吧，我还有四个月在《每日呐喊》上发文章挣的钱呢——大概——大概——嗯，比方说，大概有8000块，你觉得怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“All!Why bless you, there was my income from the Daily Warwhoop for four months—about—about—well, what should you say to about eight thousand dollars, for instance?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊！哎呀，我得说我希望看到自己也能捞到大把大把的票子。8000块！我得记下来。先生啊——除去这些，如果我没理解错的话,您还有其他收入？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Say!Why, I should say I should like to see myself rolling in just such another ocean of affluence.Eight thousand!I’ll make a note of it.Why man!—and on top of all this am I to understand that you had still more income?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈哈哈！是啊，您才看到零头，可以这么说。我还写书，《老实人在国外》，按照装订的方式，一本卖3.5到5块不等。听我说。看着我的眼睛。前四个半月，以前的销量就不说了，单单就说这四个半月，我的这本书已经卖了9.5万本。9.5万本哪！想想看。平均一本4块钱吧。就差不多有40万，我的朋友。我拿五成。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ha! Ha! Ha!Why, you’re only in the suburbs of it, so to speak.There’s my book, The Innocents Abroad price $3.50 to $5, according to the binding.Listen to me.Look me in the eye.During the last four months and a half, saying nothing of sales before that, but just simply during the four months and a half, we’ve sold ninety-five thousand copies of that book.Ninety-five thousand!Think of it.Average four dollars a copy, say.It’s nearly four hundred thousand dollars, my son.I get half.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“受苦受难的摩西啊！我得记下来。14850——8000——20万。总共，哎呀——嗯，我得说，总共大概是21.3万或21.4万！这可能吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“The suffering Moses!I’ll set that down.Fourteen-seven-fifty—eight—two hundred.Total, say—well, upon my word, the grand total is about two hundred and thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars!Is that possible?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么不可能！就算有错，也只会多，不会少。21.4万块，现金，就是我今年的收入，要是我知道怎么算数的话。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Possible!If there’s any mistake it’s the other way.Two hundred and fourteen thousand, cash, is my income for this year if I know how to cipher.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时候那位先生起身要走。我突然感到非常不自在，我将自己的老底抖了出来却什么也没换来，而且在这个陌生人的阵阵惊叹中，我还飘飘然把收入夸大很多。不过还好，绅士在最后时刻递给我一个大信封，说里面有他公司的广告，说我看了就会了解一切关于他业务的细节，还说如果我光临他会很高兴——事实上，他很骄傲像我这样的大财主光顾，还说他曾以为城里有那么几家所谓富豪，但和这些人打过交道后，他发现他们几乎都不能养家糊口，还说他实在是等了那么漫长那么漫长的时间才再次面对面看到一个富翁，和他说话，用手触碰他，他简直没法克制住自己，非常想拥抱我——事实上，他会将我允许他拥抱看作他极大的荣幸。</td>
		<td class="en">Then the gentleman got up to go.It came over me most uncomfortably that maybe I had made my revelations for nothing, besides being flattered into stretching them considerably by the stranger’s astonished exclamations.But no; at the last moment the gentleman handed me a large envelope, and said it contained his advertisement; and that I would find out all about his business in it; and that he would be happy to have my custom—would, in fact, be proud to have the custom of a man of such prodigious income; and that he used to think there were several wealthy men in the city, but when they came to trade with him he discovered that they barely had enough to live on; and that, in truth, it had been such a weary, weary age since he had seen a rich man face to face, and talked to him, and touched him with his hands, that he could hardly refrain from embracing me—in fact, would esteem it a great favor if I would let him embrace me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我听了他的话非常高兴,并不想谢绝他的好意，就同意这位心地单纯的陌生人张开双臂拥抱我，他还流下几滴镇静自己情绪的眼泪，落在我的脖子后面。之后他就走了。</td>
		<td class="en">This so pleased me that I did not try to resist, but allowed this simple-hearted stranger to throw his arms about me and weep a few tranquilizing tears down the back of my neck.Then he went his way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他刚走，我就展开了他的广告。我聚精会神地研究了四分钟。之后我唤厨子来，说：</td>
		<td class="en">As soon as he was gone I opened his advertisement.I studied it attentively for four minutes.I then called up the cook, and said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“扶着我，我要晕倒了！让玛丽去翻那煎饼。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hold me while I faint!Let Marie turn the griddle-cakes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快，我清醒过来，赶紧叫人到拐角的小酒馆去雇个行家来，为期一周，要他帮我整夜不睡诅咒那个陌生人，白天要是我骂累了骂不下去了，就由他接替。</td>
		<td class="en">By and by, when I came to, I sent down to the rum-mill on the corner and hired an artist by the week to sit up nights and curse that stranger, and give me a lift occasionally in the daytime when I came to a hard place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哼，他这个该千刀万剐的恶棍！他的“广告”根本不是所谓的广告,而是一堆该死的报税单——一连串无礼的刺探我个人私事的问题，用极小的字体印了足足四大张纸。我不得不承认，这些问题问得巧妙无比，即使是世界上最世故的人也看不明白这些问题的真实意图——这些问题设计之精妙足以让人把实际收入多报上三倍，并把试图隐瞒收入的念头彻底断绝。我到处找空子，不过好像一个也没找到。第一个问题就像一把伞遮住一个蚂蚁窝一样绰绰有余覆盖了我全部的个人经济状况：</td>
		<td class="en">Ah, what a miscreant he was!His “advertisement” was nothing in the world but a wicked tax-return—a string of impertinent questions about my private affairs, occupying the best part of four fools-cap pages of fine print-questions, I may remark, gotten up with such marvelous ingenuity that the oldest man in the world couldn’t understand what the most of them were driving at—questions, too, that were calculated to make a man report about four times his actual income to keep from swearing to a falsehood.I looked for a loophole, but there did not appear to be any.Inquiry No. 1 covered my case as generously and as amply as an umbrella could cover an ant-hill:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >去年，您在任何地方所从事的任何交易、生意或职业中总共获得多少收益？</td>
		<td class="en">What were your profits, during the past year, from any trade, business, or vocation, wherever carried on?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个问题后面附上十三个同样刨根问底的问题，其中，措辞最委婉的一个问题问：是否曾入室盗窃或拦路抢劫过或杀人放火或通过其他秘密渠道获得资产又未逐条在收入陈述中交代并与第一个问题的回答矛盾？</td>
		<td class="en">And that inquiry was backed up by thirteen others of an equally searching nature, the most modest of which required information as to whether I had committed any burglary or highway robbery, or, by any arson or other secret source of emolument had acquired property which was not enumerated in my statement of income as set opposite to inquiry No. 1.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >明摆着，那个陌生人是让我自己抖露自己了。这太明显了，所以我出去雇了另一位行家。原来由于陌生人激发了我的虚荣心，所以我才会把自己的收入申报为21.4万美元。依照法律，这其中只有一千块可以免交税——这是我唯一感到安慰的，但这只是大海中的一滴水。依照法律规定百分之五的税收，我必须向政府交总共一10650元钱的个人所得税！</td>
		<td class="en">It was plain that that stranger had enabled me to make a goose of myself.It was very, very plain; and so I went out and hired another artist.By working on my vanity, the stranger had seduced me into declaring an income of two hundred and fourteen thousand dollars.By law, one thousand dollars of this was exempt from income tax—the only relief I could see, and it was only a drop in the ocean.At the legal five per cent., I must pay to the government the sum of ten thousand six hundred and fifty dollars, income tax!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（我在此声明，事实上，我并没有真交这笔钱。）</td>
		<td class="en">[I may remark, in this place, that I did not do it.]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我认识一个非常阔绰的朋友，住的房子好像宫殿一样，他的桌子非常豪华，他的各种费用十分浩繁，可他却没有任何收入，这一点我经常在他的报税单上看到；走投无路，我只有向他求救。他接过我那摞可怕的报税单，戴上眼镜，大笔一挥，一瞬间——我就成了穷光蛋！这是有史以来干得最漂亮的事情。他只不过巧妙伪造了一份“减免税”单。他将我的财产登记为给“州政府、中央政府和市政府的”若干份。将我的“损失”分为因沉船，火灾等造成的，因投资房地产失败而造成的，因养牲口而花费的，因租用土地而花费的，因支付修理费，装修费，和利息而花掉的，还有以前缴纳的个人所得税，为支援军队，海防和税务服务而缴纳的杂七杂八的费用等等”若干份。他能从上述每个事件中做出惊人的“减免税款”——每个事件。他做完后把单子交给我，我迅速扫了一眼，看到我这年的收入，只算净收入的话，只有1250.4美元。</td>
		<td class="en">I am acquainted with a very opulent man, whose house is a palace, whose table is regal, whose outlays are enormous, yet a man who has no income, as I have often noticed by the revenue returns; and to him I went for advice in my distress.He took my dreadful exhibition of receipts, he put on his glasses, he took his pen, and presto!—I was a pauper!It was the neatest thing that ever was.He did it simply by deftly manipulating the bill of “DEDUCTIONS.”He set down my “State, national, and municipal taxes” at so much; my “losses by shipwreck; fire, etc.,” at so much; my “losses on sales of real estate”—on “live stock sold”—on “payments for rent of homestead”—on “repairs, improvements, interest”—on “previously taxed salary as an officer of the United States army, navy, revenue service,” and other things.He got astonishing “deductions” out of each and every one of these matters—each and every one of them.And when he was done he handed me the paper, and I saw at a glance that during the year my income, in the way of profits, had been one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars and forty cents.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你看”，他说，“按法律规定，1000免税。你现在只要去宣誓证明这份文件属实，再缴纳250元应付的税款就行了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now,” said he, “the thousand dollars is exempt by law.What you want to do is to go and swear this document in and pay tax on the two hundred and fifty dollars.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（他说这番话时，他的小儿子威利用手从他马甲口袋里夹出一张两美元的票子，一溜烟跑开了。我敢打赌，要是那个陌生人打算明天登门访问这个小家伙，他只能得到小家伙谎报的收入。）</td>
		<td class="en">[While he was making this speech his little boy Willie lifted a two-dollar greenback out of his vest pocket and vanished with it, and I would wager; anything that if my stranger were to call on that little boy to-morrow he would make a false return of his income.]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那您”，我问，“是不是也总为您自己用这种方法做‘减免税’单呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you,” said I, “do you always work up the ‘deductions’ after this fashion in your own case, sir?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，是这样的！要是我不弄这十一条免税条款附在‘减免税’单的名义下，我每年得沿街乞讨才能供养这么个可恨、邪恶、敲诈勒索、独断专行的政府了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I should say so!If it weren’t for those eleven saving clauses under the head of ‘Deductions’ I should be beggared every year to support this hateful and wicked, this extortionate and tyrannical government.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的这位绅士朋友受到本城最优秀人物的爱戴——他们品德高尚、文明经商、没有被弹劾污点、为政清廉——我当然要向这位榜样致敬。我走到税务局办公室，在我那个老访客谴责的眼神中，我站起身宣誓一个挨一个的谎言、一个接一个的骗局、一个又一个的无赖行为，直到我的灵魂裹上几英寸厚的伪证，我的自尊永远永远失去。</td>
		<td class="en">This gentleman stands away up among the very best of the solid men of the city—the men of moral weight, of commercial integrity, of unimpeachable, social spotlessness—and so I bowed to his example.I went down to the revenue office, and under the accusing eyes of my old visitor I stood up and swore to lie after lie, fraud after fraud, villainy after villainy, till my soul was coated inches and inches thick with perjury, and my self-respect gone for ever and ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，这又算得了什么呢？这不过就是几千名最富有、最引以为傲、最受人尊重、交口称誉、温文尔雅的美国人每年都在玩弄的把戏。所以，我一点也不在意。我也没有丝毫羞愧。今后我只能少开口乱说话，不轻易玩火，否则我难免染上某些戒不掉的恶习。</td>
		<td class="en">But what of it?It is nothing more than thousands of the richest and proudest, and most respected, honored, and courted men in America do every year.And so I don’t care.I am not ashamed.I shall simply, for the present, talk little and eschew fire-proof gloves, lest I fall into certain dreadful habits irrevocably.</td></tr>
