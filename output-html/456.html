		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >艺术家和文人们常常被斥以缺乏完整而健全的本性。这是必然的惯例了。他们视野专注、目的明确，这种艺术家气质的特点本身就是一种局限。对那些沉湎于形式美的人来说，其余的一切都无关紧要了。然而，这条规则也有不少例外。鲁宾斯曾出任大使，歌德担任过国务顾问，米尔顿曾是克伦威尔的拉丁文秘书。索夫克里斯在其城邦担任过公职；美国现代的幽默大师、杂文家以及小说家们最大的愿望莫过于能成为自己国家的外交代表；查尔斯·兰姆的朋友，托马斯·格里菲思·温赖特，这部简短传记的主人公，尽管极具艺术家的气质，追随过许多大师，却没有哪一位是艺术家。他既是诗人、画家、艺术批评家、古文物收藏家、散文家、爱美之人、对一切讨人喜欢的事物都略懂一二的人，还是一位十分了不起的造假大师、无可匹敌、空前绝后的狡猾神秘的投毒犯。</td>
		<td class="en">It has constantly been made a subject of reproach against artists and men of letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature.As a rule this must necessarily be so.That very concentration of vision and intensity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic temperament is in itself a mode of limitation.To those who are preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of much importance.Yet there are many exceptions to this rule.Rubens served as ambassador, and Goethe as state councillor, and Milton as Latin secretary to Cromwell.Sophocles held civic office in his own city; the humourists, essayists, and novelists of modern America seem to desire nothing better than to become the diplomatic representatives of their country; and Charles Lamb’s friend, Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, the subject of this brief memoir, though of an extremely artistic temperament, followed many masters other than art, being not merely a poet and a painter, an art-critic, an antiquarian, and a writer of prose, an amateur of beautiful things, and a dilettante of things delightful, but also a forger of no mean or ordinary capabilities, and as a subtle and secret poisoner almost without rival in this or any age.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位了不起的人物，恰如我们当今的一位伟大诗人所准确描述的那样：工于“笔杆子、画笔和毒药”，他于1794年出生在奇斯威克。其父是格雷律师学院及哈顿花园一位杰出律师的儿子。母亲则是赫赫有名的格里菲思博士的女儿。格里菲思乃是《每月评论》杂志的编辑兼创刊人，著名书商托马斯·戴维斯一项文学投机买卖的合伙人。约翰逊认为托马斯·戴维斯不是书商，而是“一位经营图书的绅士”、哥尔德斯密斯和韦奇伍德的朋友、是那个时代响当当的人物之一。温赖特夫人在儿子出生时不幸去世，年仅二十一岁。一份刊登在《绅士杂志》上的讣告称其“亲切和蔼、博学多才”，还有点古怪地补充道：“她应该能理解洛克先生以及当代所有男女作家的作品。”他的父亲没比其早逝的妻子长寿多久，所以这个小孩子基本上是由外祖父抚养长大的。1803年外祖父去世后，舅舅乔治·爱德华·格里菲思接着抚养他，后来被他投毒害死。他的童年在特汉·格林的林登庄园度过，这座庄园乃是乔治时代众多的豪宅之一，可惜在郊区建筑商们进驻之前就已经给毁了。他对自然单纯而炽热的爱便源于这里可爱的花园和树木葱郁的院子，这份爱终其一生从未消减。这也使得他极易受华滋华斯诗歌精神的影响。他就读于位于哈默史密斯的查尔斯·伯尼学院。伯尼先生是一位音乐史学家的儿子，还是这位注定将成为其最出色门生的艺术青年的近亲。他颇具文化修养。在以后的岁月当中，温赖特先生常常满怀深情地谈起他，称他是哲学家、考古学家、德高望重的老师——既注重智育，亦未忽略早期品德的培养。正是在伯尼先生的指引下，他开始发展自己的艺术才能。黑兹利特先生告诉我们，温赖特在学校曾用过的绘画练习本至今还在，这些作品展示了他非凡的天赋和自然的情感。的确，绘画是第一门令他着迷的艺术。直到很久以后，他才寻求用笔杆子和毒药来表达情感。</td>
		<td class="en">This remarkable man, so powerful with ‘pen, pencil and poison,’ as a great poet of our own day has finely said of him, was born at Chiswick, in 1794.His father was the son of a distinguished solicitor of Gray’s Inn and Hatton Garden.His mother was the daughter of the celebrated Dr. Griffiths, the editor and founder of the MONTHLY REVIEW, the partner in another literary speculation of Thomas Davis, that famous bookseller of whom Johnson said that he was not a bookseller, but ‘a gentleman who dealt in books,’ the friend of Goldsmith and Wedgwood, and one of the most well-known men of his day.Mrs. Wainewright died, in giving him birth, at the early age of twenty-one, and an obituary notice in the GENTLEMAN’S MAGAZINE tells us of her ‘amiable disposition and numerous accomplishments,’ and adds somewhat quaintly that ‘she is supposed to have understood the writings of Mr. Locke as well as perhaps any person of either sex now living.’His father did not long survive his young wife, and the little child seems to have been brought up by his grandfather, and, on the death of the latter in 1803, by his uncle George Edward Griffiths, whom he subsequently poisoned.His boyhood was passed at Linden House, Turnham Green, one of those many fine Georgian mansions that have unfortunately disappeared before the inroads of the suburban builder, and to its lovely gardens and well-timbered park he owed that simple and impassioned love of nature which never left him all through his life, and which made him so peculiarly susceptible to the spiritual influences of Wordsworth’s poetry.He went to school at Charles Burney’s academy at Hammersmith.Mr. Burney was the son of the historian of music, and the near kinsman of the artistic lad who was destined to turn out his most remarkable pupil.He seems to have been a man of a good deal of culture, and in after years Mr. Wainewright often spoke of him with much affection as a philosopher, an archaeologist, and an admirable teacher who, while he valued the intellectual side of education, did not forget the importance of early moral training.It was under Mr. Burney that he first developed his talent as an artist, and Mr. Hazlitt tells us that a drawing-book which he used at school is still extant, and displays great talent and natural feeling.Indeed, painting was the first art that fascinated him.It was not till much later that he sought to find expression by pen or poison.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而此前，他似乎一直沉醉于孩提时代的梦想，憧憬着军旅生活的浪漫与侠义，后来成为了一名年轻的卫兵。但是战友们轻率鲁莽和放荡不羁的生活无法满足他高雅的艺术气质，他适合从事别的职业。不久，他便厌倦了兵役生活。“艺术，”他告诉我们，“艺术感觉到了他的背叛，以其纯洁高尚的影响涤清了污浊的迷雾。我的情感，干涸、炙热、暗淡无光，因为沁凉、新鲜的花朵才得以修复，而这花朵在单纯的心看来是简单而美丽的。”这番饱含真挚、热情得有些离谱的话至今仍令许多人为之动容。但艺术并不是这个转变的唯一原因。“华滋华斯的作品，”他接着说道，“在很大程度上抚平了伴随突变接踵而至的令人困惑的混乱。我为此而流下了幸福和感激的泪水。”他因此离开了军队，带着对军营中鄙陋生活的回忆和对军队食堂里那些粗俗的闲聊的记忆回到了林登庄园，充满着对文艺新生的热情。有好一阵子，他重病缠身。其间，用他自己的话说，他就像“一只破碎的陶罐”。他那脆弱的神经，尽管对施加给别人的痛苦丝毫没有察觉，却对自身的疼痛极其敏感。在摧残人类生命的痛苦面前他萎靡不振，好像还曾徘徊在可怕忧郁的深谷之中，这深谷，令许多伟大的、甚至更伟大的灵魂都无从摆脱。不过他年轻——才25岁——于是很快就从他自己所谓的“黑色死水”中脱离出来，投身于更为广阔的人文世界。就在他逐渐从险些把自己带进鬼门关的疾病中恢复过来时，他萌生了从事文学这门艺术的念头。“我告诉过约翰·伍德维尔，”他声称，“这样的日子简直就是神仙般的生活。”去观察、聆听并记录下美妙的事物——“这些生活中的风起云涌不会消亡”。</td>
		<td class="en">Before this, however, he seems to have been carried away by boyish dreams of the romance and chivalry of a soldier’s life, and to have become a young guardsman.But the reckless dissipated life of his companions failed to satisfy the refined artistic temperament of one who was made for other things.In a short time he wearied of the service.‘Art,’ he tells us, in words that still move many by their ardent sincerity and strange fervour, ‘Art touched her renegade; by her pure and high influence the noisome mists were purged; my feelings, parched, hot, and tarnished, were renovated with cool, fresh bloom, simple, beautiful to the simple-hearted.’But Art was not the only cause of the change.‘The writings of Wordsworth,’ he goes on to say, ‘did much towards calming the confusing whirl necessarily incident to sudden mutations.I wept over them tears of happiness and gratitude.’He accordingly left the army, with its rough barrack-life and coarse mess-room tittle-tattle, and returned to Linden House, full of this new-born enthusiasm for culture.A severe illness, in which, to use his own words, he was ‘broken like a vessel of clay,’ prostrated him for a time.His delicately strung organisation, however indifferent it might have been to inflicting pain on others, was itself most keenly sensitive to pain.He shrank from suffering as a thing that mars and maims human life, and seems to have wandered through that terrible valley of melancholia from which so many great, perhaps greater, spirits have never emerged.But he was young—only twenty-five years of age—and he soon passed out of the ‘dead black waters,’ as he called them, into the larger air of humanistic culture.As he was recovering from the illness that had led him almost to the gates of death, he conceived the idea of taking up literature as an art.‘I said with John Woodvil,’ he cries, ‘it were a life of gods to dwell in such an element,’ to see and hear and write brave things:—‘These high and gusty relishes of life Have no allayings of mortality.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们不可能感觉不到洋溢在这篇文章里的是一个人对文字的真挚热忱。“去观察、聆听和记录下美妙的事物”，这就是他的目标。</td>
		<td class="en">It is impossible not to feel that in this passage we have the utterance of a man who had a true passion for letters.‘To see and hear and write brave things,’ this was his aim.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >《伦敦杂志》的编辑斯科特，被这位年轻人的天才所打动，抑或是受到了他施予每个人的那种奇特魅惑的影响，邀请他给艺术专题写系列文章。于是他开始以一系列新奇的笔名，为自己那个时代的文学奉献作品。“贾纳斯·韦塞科克”、“埃格麦特·博恩莫特”和“范·温克夫”都是些他用来隐藏严肃或展示轻浮的怪异面具。面具能比真实面孔告诉我们更多东西。这些伪装凸显了他的个性。他成名的速度之快令人难以置信。查尔斯·兰姆说起“亲切友好、无忧无虑的温赖特”时，称其散文简直“棒极了”。我们听说他在阿佩蒂特餐厅设宴款待麦克里迪、约翰·福斯特、马金、塔尔福德、温特沃斯·迪尔克爵士、诗人约翰·克莱尔等一批人。像迪斯雷利一样，他决心要让整座城市惊艳于他这位花花公子。他那漂亮的戒指、古雅的宝石胸针和浅柠檬色的娃娃手套众所周知，还被黑兹利特视为文学新形式的标志。他丰盈的卷发、漂亮的眼睛、优雅白皙的双手令他与旁人截然不同，招人喜欢却又危机四伏。他有点像巴尔扎克笔下的吕西安·德吕蓬。有时他会令我们想起朱利安·索雷尔。德昆西曾与他有过一面之缘。那是在查尔斯·兰姆家中的一次宴会上。</td>
		<td class="en">Scott, the editor of the LONDON MAGAZINE, struck by the young man’s genius, or under the influence of the strange fascination that he exercised on every one who knew him, invited him to write a series of articles on artistic subjects, and under a series of fanciful pseudonym he began to contribute to the literature of his day.JANUS WEATHERCOCK, EGOMET BONMOT, and VAN VINKVOOMS, were some of the grotesque masks under which he choose to hide his seriousness or to reveal his levity.A mask tells us more than a face.These disguises intensified his personality.In an incredibly short time he seems to have made his mark.Charles Lamb speaks of ‘kind, light-hearted Wainewright,’ whose prose is ‘capital.’We hear of him entertaining Macready, John Forster, Maginn, Talfourd, Sir Wentworth Dilke, the poet John Clare, and others, at A PETIT-DINER.Like Disraeli, he determined to startle the town as a dandy, and his beautiful rings, his antique cameo breast-pin, and his pale lemon-coloured kid gloves, were well known, and indeed were regarded by Hazlitt as being the signs of a new manner in literature: while his rich curly hair, fine eyes, and exquisite white hands gave him the dangerous and delightful distinction of being different from others.There was something in him of Balzac’s Lucien de Rubempre.At times he reminds us of Julien Sorel.De Quincey saw him once.It was at a dinner at Charles Lamb’s.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“座上客都是文人，其中有个杀人犯。”他告诉我们说，然后接着讲他那天如何地不舒服，多么厌恶那些男男女女的面孔。然而他却发现自己正饶有兴趣地审视着餐桌对面的那位年轻作家。在这位年轻作家装模作样的举止下似乎潜藏着丰富的毫不矫饰的真诚。试想，他要是知道兰姆如此器重的这位客人曾造了多少孽，甚至有罪时，“那种突然滋生的别样兴趣”会如何改变他的心情呢。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Amongst the company, all literary men, sat a murderer,’ he tells us, and he goes on to describe how on that day he had been ill, and had hated the face of man and woman, and yet found himself looking with intellectual interest across the table at the young writer beneath whose affectations of manner there seemed to him to lie so much unaffected sensibility, and speculates on ‘what sudden growth of another interest’ would have changed his mood, had he known of what terrible sin the guest to whom Lamb paid so much attention was even then guilty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >恰如斯温伯恩先生所言，温赖特一生的著述自然地分为三类。在一定程度上得承认，如果我们不考虑他在用毒方面的成就，那剩下的就会让他有点名不副实了。</td>
		<td class="en">His life-work falls naturally under the three heads suggested by Mr. Swinburne, and it may be partly admitted that, if we set aside his achievements in the sphere of poison, what he has actually left to us hardly justifies his reputation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但也只有俗不可耐者才会以成果的多少这个庸俗的标准来对人品头论足。这位年轻的花花公子追求的是身份，而非作为。他意识到生活本身就是种艺术，其风格模式和表达艺术的方式一样丰富。他的作品并非索然无味。我们听说威廉·布莱克在皇家学院曾驻足在他的一幅画前，认为此作“非常不错”。他的杂文预见到很多后来成为现实的东西。他预见到的一些关于现代文化的情况被许多人视作真正的实质。他写了关于乔康达夫人、早期法国诗人和意大利文艺复兴的文章。他喜欢希腊宝石、波斯地毯、伊丽莎白时代《丘比特和赛琪》的译本、《寻爱绮梦》、书籍的装帧、早期的版本和留有宽边的校样稿。他特别善于发现优美环境的价值，乐此不疲地向我们描述他居住过或曾有意居住的房间。他对绿色有种异乎寻常的偏爱，这就个人而言意味着一种微妙的艺术气质，就国家来说则昭示着一种散漫放纵——若非道德沦丧的话。和博德莱尔一样，他特别喜欢猫；又如同戈蒂埃一样，他对我们如今仍能在佛罗伦萨和卢浮宫见到的“可爱的雌雄大理石怪兽”着迷不已。</td>
		<td class="en">But then it is only the Philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by the vulgar test of production.This young dandy sought to be somebody, rather than to do something.He recognised that Life itself is in art, and has its modes of style no less than the arts that seek to express it.Nor is his work without interest.We hear of William Blake stopping in the Royal Academy before one of his pictures and pronouncing it to be ‘very fine.’His essays are prefiguring of much that has since been realised.He seems to have anticipated some of those accidents of modern culture that are regarded by many as true essentials.He writes about La Gioconda, and early French poets and the Italian Renaissance.He loves Greek gems, and Persian carpets, and Elizabethan translations of CUPID AND PSYCHE, and the HYPNEROTOMACHIA, and book-binding and early editions, and wide-margined proofs.He is keenly sensitive to the value of beautiful surroundings, and never wearies of describing to us the rooms in which he lived, or would have liked to live.He had that curious love of green, which in individuals is always the sign of a subtle artistic temperament, and in nations is said to denote a laxity, if not a decadence of morals.Like Baudelaire he was extremely fond of cats, and with Gautier, he was fascinated by that ‘sweet marble monster’ of both sexes that we can still see at Florence and in the Louvre.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，在他的描述和对装饰的见解中有许多地方表明他并没有完全摆脱他那个时代的一些错误审美观。但很明显，他是最早意识到审美折衷主义要旨究竟是什么的人之一——我所指的是所有真正美好事物的真正和谐，与年代、地域、流派和风格无关。他从房间的装饰中看到了这一点——不是用来显摆而是为了居住。我们的目标绝不是对过去考古式的复原，也没必要为寻求幻想中的历史准确性而使自己不堪重负。在这一艺术理念上他绝对是正确的。所有美好的事物都属于同一时代。</td>
		<td class="en">There is of course much in his descriptions, and his suggestions for decoration, that shows that he did not entirely free himself from the false taste of his time.But it is clear that he was one of the first to recognise what is, indeed, the very keynote of aesthetic eclecticism, I mean the true harmony of all really beautiful things irrespective of age or place, of school or manner.He saw that in decorating a room, which is to be, not a room for show, but a room to live in, we should never aim at any archaeological reconstruction of the past, nor burden ourselves with any fanciful necessity for historical accuracy.In this artistic perception he was perfectly right.All beautiful things belong to the same age.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此在他的图书馆，如他自己描述的那样，我们发现了精致的希腊陶制花瓶。瓶身上绘有精美的图案，侧面有整齐而模糊的字迹（无法复原的希腊文）。花瓶背后挂着一幅雕刻作品，大概是迈克尔·安杰洛的《德尔菲女巫》，又或许是乔尔乔涅的《牧羊人》。还有一小块佛罗伦萨的花式陶片和不知从哪个古罗马墓穴中弄来的一盏粗制的灯。书桌上放着一本祷告的小册子，“套在镀有纯银的封面里，制作方法极不寻常，嵌着小颗的钻石和红宝石”。书的旁边“蹲着一只丑陋的小怪兽，可能是从西西里岛阳光灿烂的玉米地中发掘出来的古罗马家庭守护神”。一些晦暗的铜制古董与两件泛着淡淡光泽的耶稣受难圣像形成了鲜明的对比。这两尊圣像之中，一尊由象牙雕成，另一尊则是蜡铸的。他拥有塔斯马尼亚的宝石托盘、绘有佩蒂托微型画的路易十四样式的小糖果盒、还有他倍加赞许的“棕黄褐色的镶金丝茶壶”、香橼色摩洛哥信盒以及“波莫纳岛绿”椅子。</td>
		<td class="en">And so, in his own library, as he describes it, we find the delicate fictile vase of the Greek, with its exquisitely painted figures and the faint (Greek text which cannot be reproduced) finely traced upon its side, and behind it hangs an engraving of the ‘Delphic Sibyl’ of Michael Angelo, or of the ‘Pastoral’ of Giorgione.Here is a bit of Florentine majolica, and here a rude lamp from some old Roman tomb.On the table lies a book of Hours, ‘cased in a cover of solid silver gilt, wrought with quaint devices and studded with small brilliants and rubies,’ and close by it ‘squats a little ugly monster, a Lar, perhaps, dug up in the sunny fields of corn-bearing Sicily.’Some dark antique bronzes contrast with the pale gleam of two noble CHRISTI CRUCIFIXI, one carved in ivory, the other moulded in wax.’He has his trays of Tassie’s gems, his tiny Louis-Quatorze BONBONNIERE with a miniature by Petitot, his highly prized ‘brown-biscuit teapots, filagree-worked,’ his citron morocco letter-case, and his ‘pomona-green’ chair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们可以想象他躺在自己的书堆、塑像和雕刻中，像一位真正的古董收藏家、一位细致入微的鉴赏家那样，翻看着他收集的梅尔·安东尼厄斯的精美物品和他热心崇拜的特纳的“研究的书”；或是拿着放大镜琢磨着他的一些古老的珠宝和宝石上的浮雕——“双层玛瑙上的亚历山大头像”，或是“那座红玉髓至尊浮雕——朱庇特·伊吉奥库斯”。他是位了不起的雕刻业余爱好者，对于最佳的收藏办法提出过非常有用的建议。的确，在充分欣赏现代艺术的同时，他从未忽视再现过去伟大杰作的重要性，他对石膏模型的价值所作的论述都非常令人钦佩。</td>
		<td class="en">One can fancy him lying there in the midst of his books and casts and engravings, a true virtuoso, a subtle connoisseur, turning over his fine collection of Mare Antonios, and his Turner’s ‘Liber Studiorum,’ of which he was a warm admirer, or examining with a magnifier some of his antique gems and cameos, ‘the head of Alexander on an onyx of two strata,’ or ‘that superb ALTISSIMO RELIEVO on cornelian, Jupiter AEgiochus.’He was always a great amateur of engravings, and gives some very useful suggestions as to the best means of forming a collection.Indeed, while fully appreciating modern art, he never lost sight of the importance of reproductions of the great masterpieces of the past, and all that he says about the value of plaster casts is quite admirable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >作为一名艺术批评家，他主要关注艺术作品给人的复杂印象。当然，审美批评的第一步就是要清楚自己的印象。他对美之本质的抽象探讨毫不关心。而成果丰硕的历史方法论也与他的时代格格不入。但他从未忽视这个重要的事实：艺术首先吸引的不是理智，也不是感情，而纯粹是一种艺术天性。他不止一次地指出，这种天性，这种他所谓的“品味”，不知不觉地在频繁接触佳作的同时受其引导而日臻完美，并最终形成一种正确的判断力。当然，艺术也有时尚，如同服装有潮流一样。而且，或许我们谁都不能免受风俗和新奇事物的影响。他当然也不能。而且他坦言，要公正地评判当代作品是非常困难的。但是，总的来说，他的判断力不错而且合情合理。他曾在特纳和康斯特布尔还未得到今天的礼遇时就对他们倍加推崇。对于最具艺术价值的风景画，他认为我们需要的“不仅仅是技法和丝毫不差的描摹”。关于克罗姆的《诺里奇附近的荒原》，他评论说它显示了“对荒野细致入微的观察在索然无味的平板画中起到的巨大作用”。关于他那个年代所流行的风景画，他说其“仅仅是对高山、峡谷、树桩、灌木、河流、草地、村舍、房屋的简单堆砌；仅仅是一种地形图的绘制，一种有图像的地图；彩虹、骤雨、雾霭、光环、透过云朵缝隙的大片光束、暴雨、星光，所有真正的画家所珍视的东西都没能在画面上展现”。他对艺术中的一目了然和平庸无奇是彻头彻尾地讨厌；他在晚宴上欣然款待威尔基,却对戴维爵士的画作和克拉布先生的诗歌毫无兴趣。他对他那个时代的模仿之风和现实主义倾向毫不认同，并向我们坦言说，他对富泽利的崇拜主要归因于这个小个子瑞士人不认为画家只能画他们所见的事物。他在绘画中追求的品质是构图、线条的美感、色彩的丰富和想象力。换个角度讲，他不是个教条主义者。“我认为，任何艺术作品只能接受由其本身所演变而来的法则检验：重要的是作品是否与其本身一脉相承。”这是他最经典的格言之一。在评论诸位风格迥异的画家，如兰西尔、马丁、斯托瑟德和埃蒂时，用现在一句经典的话来说，他正试图去“看清事物的本质”。</td>
		<td class="en">As an art-critic he concerned himself primarily with the complex impressions produced by a work of art, and certainly the first step in aesthetic criticism is to realise one’s own impressions.He cared nothing for abstract discussions on the nature of the Beautiful, and the historical method, which has since yielded such rich fruit, did not belong to his day, but he never lost sight of the great truth that Art’s first appeal is neither to the intellect nor to the emotions, but purely to the artistic temperament, and he more than once points out that this temperament, this ‘taste,’ as he calls it, being unconsciously guided and made perfect by frequent contact with the best work, becomes in the end a form of right judgment.Of course there are fashions in art just as there are fashions in dress, and perhaps none of us can ever quite free ourselves from the influence of custom and the influence of novelty.He certainly could not, and he frankly acknowledges how difficult it is to form any fair estimate of contemporary work.But, on the whole, his taste was good and sound.He admired Turner and Constable at a time when they were not so much thought of as they are now, and saw that for the highest landscape art we require more than ‘mere industry and accurate transcription.’Of Crome’s ‘Heath Scene near Norwich’ he remarks that it shows ‘how much a subtle observation of the elements, in their wild moods, does for a most uninteresting flat,’ and of the popular type of landscape of his day he says that it is ‘simply an enumeration of hill and dale, stumps of trees, shrubs, water, meadows, cottages and houses; little more than topography, a kind of pictorial map-work; in which rainbows, showers, mists, haloes, large beams shooting through rifted clouds, storms, starlight, all the most valued materials of the real painter, are not.’He had a thorough dislike of what is obvious or commonplace in art, and while he was charmed to entertain Wilkie at dinner, he cared as little for Sir David’s pictures as he did for Mr. Crabbe’s poems.With the imitative and realistic tendencies of his day he had no sympathy and he tells us frankly that his great admiration for Fuseli was largely due to the fact that the little Swiss did not consider it necessary that an artist should paint only what he sees.The qualities that he sought for in a picture were composition, beauty and dignity of line, richness of colour, and imaginative power.Upon the other hand, he was not a doctrinaire.‘I hold that no work of art can be tried otherwise than by laws deduced from itself: whether or not it be consistent with itself is the question.’This is one of his excellent aphorisms.And in criticising painters so different as Landseer and Martin, Stothard and Etty, he shows that, to use a phrase now classical, he is trying ‘to see the object as in itself it really is.’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">However, we must not forget that the cultivated young man who penned these lines, and who was so susceptible to Wordsworthian influences, was also, as I said at the beginning of this memoir, one of the most subtle and secret poisoners of this or any age.How he first became fascinated by this strange sin he does not tell us, and the diary in which he carefully noted the results of his terrible experiments and the methods that he adopted, has unfortunately been lost to us.Even in later days, too, he was always reticent on the matter, and preferred to speak about ‘The Excursion,’ and the ‘Poems founded on the Affections.’There is no doubt, however, that the poison that he used was strychnine.In one of the beautiful rings of which he was so proud, and which served to show off the fine modelling of his delicate ivory hands, he used to carry crystals of the Indian NUX VOMICA, a poison, one of his biographers tells us, ‘nearly tasteless, difficult of discovery, and capable of almost infinite dilution.’His murders, says De Quincey, were more than were ever made known judicially.This is no doubt so, and some of them are worthy of mention.His first victim was his uncle, Mr. Thomas Griffiths.He poisoned him in 1829 to gain possession of Linden House, a place to which he had always been very much attached.In the August of the next year he poisoned Mrs. Abercrombie, his wife’s mother, and in the following December he poisoned the lovely Helen Abercrombie, his sister-in-law.Why he murdered Mrs. Abercrombie is not ascertained.It may have been for a caprice, or to quicken some hideous sense of power that was in him, or because she suspected something, or for no reason.But the murder of Helen Abercrombie was carried out by himself and his wife for the sake of a sum of about 18,000 pounds, for which they had insured her life in various offices.The circumstances were as follows.On the 12th of December, he and his wife and child came up to London from Linden House, and took lodgings at No. 12 Conduit Street, Regent Street.With them were the two sisters, Helen and Madeleine Abercrombie.On the evening of the 14th they all went to the play, and at supper that night Helen sickened.The next day she was extremely ill, and Dr. Locock, of Hanover Square, was called in to attend her.She lived till Monday, the 20th, when, after the doctor’s morning visit, Mr. and Mrs. Wainewright brought her some poisoned jelly, and then went out for a walk.When they returned Helen Abercrombie was dead.She was about twenty years of age, a tall graceful girl with fair hair.A very charming red-chalk drawing of her by her brother-in—law is still in existence, and shows how much his style as an artist was influenced by Sir Thomas Lawrence, a painter for whose work he had always entertained a great admiration.De Quincey says that Mrs. Wainewright was not really privy to the murder.Let us hope that she was not.Sin should be solitary, and have no accomplices.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >基于案情陈述不清且无利可图，保险公司怀疑案子的真相所以拒不赔偿。投毒者竟以异乎寻常的勇气向大法官法庭起诉帝国保险公司。双方协议商定，一审判决对所有案例起效。然而审判一拖就是五年。经过一番争执，最终做出了对公司有利的裁决。当时的法官是阿宾杰大人。代表原告一方的是厄尔先生和威廉·福利特爵士；首席检察官和弗雷德里克·波洛克则代表另外一方。不幸的是，原告本人两次审判都未能出席。保险公司拒绝向他支付18,000英镑的决定把他推入了最痛苦的经济上的窘境。事实上，在杀害海伦·阿伯克龙比几个月后，他在伦敦的大街上因为负债而被捕。当时他正在向一位朋友漂亮的女儿示爱。当时他暂时度过了这一难关，但不久后他觉得出国会好一些，等到能够妥善应对债主们时再回来。于是他前往布洛涅去拜望他意属的那位年轻小姐的父亲，并诱骗他向鹈鹕公司投保3000英镑的人寿险。就在履行完所有必需的手续、保险生效之后他便趁一天晚饭后和朋友坐在一起的机会朝朋友的咖啡里投放了士的宁晶体。他本人并未因此捞到什么好处。他的目的是要报复第一家保险公司拒绝为他的罪孽买单。他的朋友第二天就死在了他面前，他随即离开了布洛涅到布列塔尼风景最美的地区写生去了，并一度成为一位在圣奥默拥有一座美丽乡间住宅的法国绅士家的座上客。从这儿他又去了巴黎，在那儿呆了好几年，过着奢华的生活，有人如是说道。还有人说他“口袋里揣着毒药鬼鬼祟祟，所有认识他的人都惧他几分”。1837年，他悄悄溜回了英国。一些莫名其妙的疯狂想法把他领了回来。他当时正在追求一个他钟情的女子。</td>
		<td class="en">The insurance companies, suspecting the real facts of the case, declined to pay the policy on the technical ground of misrepresentation and want of interest, and, with curious courage, the poisoner entered an action in the Court of Chancery against the Imperial, it being agreed that one decision should govern all the cases.The trial, however, did not come on for five years, when, after one disagreement, a verdict was ultimately given in the companies’ favour.The judge on the occasion was Lord Abinger.EGOMET BONMOT was represented by Mr. Erle and Sir William Follet, and the Attorney-General and Sir Frederick Pollock appeared for the other side.The plaintiff, unfortunately, was unable to be present at either of the trials.The refusal of the companies to give him the 18,000 pounds had placed him in a position of most painful pecuniary embarrassment.Indeed, a few months after the murder of Helen Abercrombie, he had been actually arrested for debt in the streets of London while he was serenading the pretty daughter of one of his friends.This difficulty was got over at the time, but shortly afterwards he thought it better to go abroad till he could come to some practical arrangement with his creditors.He accordingly went to Boulogne on a visit to the father of the young lady in question, and while he was there induced him to insure his life with the Pelican Company for 3000 pounds.As soon as the necessary formalities had been gone through and the policy executed, he dropped some crystals of strychnine into his coffee as they sat together one evening after dinner.He himself did not gain any monetary advantage by doing this.His aim was simply to revenge himself on the first office that had refused to pay him the price of his sin.His friend died the next day in his presence, and he left Boulogne at once for a sketching tour through the most picturesque parts of Brittany, and was for some time the guest of an old French gentleman, who had a beautiful country house at St. Omer.From this he moved to Paris, where he remained for several years, living in luxury, some say, while others talk of his ‘skulking with poison in his pocket, and being dreaded by all who knew him.’In 1837 he returned to England privately.Some strange mad fascination brought him back.He followed a woman whom he loved.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He was taken back to Newgate, preparatory to his removal to the colonies.In a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he had fancied himself ‘lying in Horsemonger Gaol under sentence of death’ for having been unable to resist the temptation of stealing some Marc Antonios from the British Museum in order to complete his collection.The sentence now passed on him was to a man of his culture a form of death.He complained bitterly of it to his friends, and pointed out, with a good deal of reason, some people may fancy, that the money was practically his own, having come to him from his mother, and that the forgery, such as it was, had been committed thirteen years before, which, to use his own phrase, was at least a CIRCONSTANCE ATTENUANTE.The permanence of personality is a very subtle metaphysical problem, and certainly the English law solves the question in an extremely rough-and-ready manner.There is, however, something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was inflicted on him for what, if we remember his fatal influence on the prose of modern journalism, was certainly not the worst of all his sins.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">From Newgate he was brought to the hulks at Portsmouth, and sent from there in the SUSAN to Van Diemen’s Land along with three hundred other convicts.The voyage seems to have been most distasteful to him, and in a letter written to a friend he spoke bitterly about the ignominy of ‘the companion of poets and artists’ being compelled to associate with ‘country bumpkins.’The phrase that he applies to his companions need not surprise us.Crime in England is rarely the result of sin.It is nearly always the result of starvation.There was probably no one on board in whom he would have found a sympathetic listener, or even a psychologically interesting nature.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，他对艺术的热爱却从未消减。在霍巴特他成立了一个画室，重新开始素描和肖像的创作。他的言谈举止似乎风采依旧。就连投毒的习惯他也没放弃。有两次还记录在案——他企图害死冒犯过他的人。但他的手好像失去了以往的灵巧了。两次企图都彻底败露。而且在1844年，由于对塔斯马尼亚环境的彻底失望，他向殖民总督约翰·厄德利·威尔莫特提交了一份请愿书，恳请离开。在请愿书中，他称自己“饱受争取和实现外迁想法的折磨，不能增长见识，无法发表有益的，甚至是得体的言论”。然而，他的请求遭到了拒绝。科尔里奇的这位朋友就通过制造神奇的人造天堂来抚慰自己，其中的奥妙只有吸食鸦片的人才了解。1852年，他死于中风。他生活中唯一的伴儿是一只猫。他对这只猫表现出了非比寻常的感情。</td>
		<td class="en">His love of art, however, never deserted him.At Hobart Town he started a studio, and returned to sketching and portrait-painting, and his conversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm.Nor did he give up his habit of poisoning, and there are two cases on record in which he tried to make away with people who had offended him.But his hand seems to have lost its cunning.Both of his attempts were complete failures, and in 1844, being thoroughly dissatisfied with Tasmanian society, he presented a memorial to the governor of the settlement, Sir John Eardley Wilmot, praying for a ticket-of-leave.In it he speaks of himself as being ‘tormented by ideas struggling for outward form and realisation, barred up from increase of knowledge, and deprived of the exercise of profitable or even of decorous speech.’His request, however, was refused, and the associate of Coleridge consoled himself by making those marvellous PARADIS ARTIFICIELS whose secret is only known to the eaters of opium.In 1852 he died of apoplexy, his sole living companion being a cat, for which he had evinced at extraordinary affection.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的罪行似乎对他的艺术产生了重大的影响。这些罪行给他的风格注入了一种强烈的个性，这是他早期作品所缺乏的特点。在《狄更斯传》的一条注释中，福斯特提到在1847年，布兰森顿夫人从她那个在霍巴特供于军职的哥哥鲍尔少校那儿收到一幅出自温赖特灵巧之笔的一位年轻女士的油画肖像。据说，“他精心地将自己的邪恶表情融进了这位美丽善良女子的肖像之中”。左拉在他的一本小说中告诉我们，一个犯过谋杀罪的青年走上了艺术的道路，为那些备受尊敬的人们绘制带绿色的印象派肖像画，所有的画像都与他那些受害者出奇地相似。温赖特先生画风的转变在我看来似乎更加微妙、耐人寻味。你能想象那是一种源于罪恶的强烈个性。</td>
		<td class="en">His crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art.They gave a strong personality to his style, a quality that his early work certainly lacked.In a note to the LIFE OF DICKENS, Forster mentions that in 1847 Lady Blessington received from her brother, Major Power, who held a military appointment at Hobart Town, an oil portrait of a young lady from his clever brush; and it is said that ‘he had contrived to put the expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice, kind-hearted girl.’M. Zola, in one of his novels, tells us of a young man who, having committed a murder, takes to art, and paints greenish impressionist portraits of perfectly respectable people, all of which bear a curious resemblance to his victim.The development of Mr. Wainewright’s style seems to me far more subtle and suggestive.One can fancy an intense personality being created out of sin.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">This strange and fascinating figure that for a few years dazzled literary London, and made so brilliant a DEBUT in life and letters, is undoubtedly a most interesting study.Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt, his latest biographer, to whom I am indebted for many of the facts contained in this memoir, and whose little book is, indeed, quite invaluable in its way, is of opinion that his love of art and nature was a mere pretence and assumption, and others have denied to him all literary power.This seems to me a shallow, or at least a mistaken, view.The fact of a man being a poisoner is nothing against his prose.The domestic virtues are not the true basis of art, though they may serve as an excellent advertisement for second-rate artists.It is possible that De Quincey exaggerated his critical powers, and I cannot help saying again that there is much in his published works that is too familiar, too common, too journalistic, in the bad sense of that bad word.Here and there he is distinctly vulgar in expression, and he is always lacking in the self-restraint of the true artist.But for some of his faults we must blame the time in which he lived, and, after all, prose that Charles Lamb thought ‘capital’ has no small historic interest.That he had a sincere love of art and nature seems to me quite certain.There is no essential incongruity between crime and culture.We cannot re-write the whole of history for the purpose of gratifying our moral sense of what should be.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，因为他同我们的时代太近，所以难以单纯地对其从艺术角度进行评判。不对一个可能曾毒死了坦尼森勋爵，或格拉德斯通先生，或巴利奥尔学院院长的人心存偏见是不大可能的。但如果此人与我们身着不同的服饰，讲不同的语言，生活在罗马帝国，或者意大利文艺复兴时期，抑或是十七世纪的西班牙，或是除了这个世纪这片土地之外的任何世纪任何地方，我们或许能对他的地位和价值做出毫无偏见的评价。我知道有许多历史学家，或者至少是历史题材作家仍然认为应该将道德评判运用到历史中去。他们俨然一副成功训导者的派头，褒此贬彼。但这是一个愚蠢的习惯，仅仅说明道德的本能可以达到一种完美的高度——出现在并不需要它的地方。具有正确历史观的人是不会妄图批评尼罗，或是指责泰比里厄斯，或去非难西泽·博尔吉亚。这些人物已经变得很像戏剧中的木偶。他们可能令我们恐惧、害怕或者惊讶，但他们不会伤害我们。他们与我们没有直接的关系。我们对他们无从可惧。他们已经进入了艺术和科学领域，而科学和艺术均无关乎道德上的赞同与反对。因此查尔斯·兰姆的这位朋友有一天也会如此。目前，我感觉他只是与我们太近，因此我们无法不对他心怀好奇。基于这种好奇，我们才如此醉心于对约翰·阿丁顿·西蒙兹先生、Ａ. 玛丽·Ｆ. 鲁滨逊小姐、弗农·李小姐和其他一些杰出作家笔下那些文艺复兴时期的伟大罪犯的研究。但是，艺术并没有将他遗忘。他是狄更斯笔下《穷追不舍》里的主人公，布尔沃笔下《柳克丽霞》里的瓦尼。令人高兴的是，小说对这位擅长“笔杆子、画笔和毒药”的人颇有几分敬重。对于小说而言，含义隽永远比事实更为重要。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course, he is far too close to our own time for us to be able to form any purely artistic judgment about him.It is impossible not to feel a strong prejudice against a man who might have poisoned Lord Tennyson, or Mr. Gladstone, or the Master of Balliol.But had the man worn a costume and spoken a language different from our own, had he lived in imperial Rome, or at the time of the Italian Renaissance, or in Spain in the seventeenth century, or in any land or any century but this century and this land, we would be quite able to arrive at a perfectly unprejudiced estimate of his position and value.I know that there are many historians, or at least writers on historical subjects, who still think it necessary to apply moral judgments to history, and who distribute their praise or blame with the solemn complacency of a successful schoolmaster.This, however, is a foolish habit, and merely shows that the moral instinct can be brought to such a pitch of perfection that it will make its appearance wherever it is not required.Nobody with the true historical sense ever dreams of blaming Nero, or scolding Tiberius, or censuring Caesar Borgia.These personages have become like the puppets of a play.They may fill us with terror, or horror, or wonder, but they do not harm us.They are not in immediate relation to us.We have nothing to fear from them.They have passed into the sphere of art and science, and neither art nor science knows anything of moral approval or disapproval.And so it may be some day with Charles Lamb’s friend.At present I feel that he is just a little too modern to be treated in that fine spirit of disinterested curiosity to which we owe so many charming studies of the great criminals of the Italian Renaissance from the pens of Mr. John Addington Symonds, Miss A. Mary F. Robinson, Miss Vernon Lee, and other distinguished writers.However, Art has not forgotten him.He is the hero of Dickens’s HUNTED DOWN, the Varney of Bulwer’s LUCRETIA; and it is gratifying to note that fiction has paid some homage to one who was so powerful with ‘pen, pencil and poison.’To be suggestive for fiction is to be of more importance than a fact.</td></tr>
