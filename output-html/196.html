		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >夏威夷是一个奇怪的地方。社会上所有的事情都可以说是颠倒的。尽管有些事情是正确的。它们几乎是太正确了。但是事情还是有点混乱。那里有一群极其独特的人——“传教帮”。在夏威夷，那些无名的、寻求苦难的传教士竟成了富有的贵族的贵宾，这让人相当震惊。但这是真的。那些谦卑的新英格兰人在19世纪30年代来到这里，为了一个崇高的目的，即向夏威夷土人传播真正的宗教并教他们膜拜唯一真实且无可否认的上帝。他们在这方面做得很成功，也成功教化了夏威夷土人。而夏威夷土人到第二代或第三代时，实际上已经灭绝了。这作为福音的种子结出的果实，作为那些传教士（以及他们的儿子和孙子）播种收获的果实，归那些岛屿本身所有——也属于土地、港口、城镇，以及甘蔗种植园：那前来送生命食粮的传道士留了下来，很快吞噬了全部异教徒。</td>
		<td class="en">Hawaii is a queer place.Everything socially is what I may call topsy-turvy.Not but what things are correct.They are almost too much so.But still things are sort of upside down.The most ultra-exclusive set there is the “Missionary Crowd.”It comes with rather a shock to learn that in Hawaii the obscure martyrdom-seeking missionary sits at the head of the table of the moneyed aristocracy.But it is true.The humble New Englanders who came out in the third decade of the nineteenth century, came for the lofty purpose of teaching the kanakas the true religion, the worship of the one only genuine and undeniable God.So well did they succeed in this, and also in civilizing the kanaka, that by the second or third generation he was practically extinct.This being the fruit of the seed of the Gospel, the fruit of the seed of the missionaries (the sons and the grandsons) was the possession of the islands themselves,—of the land, the ports, the town sites, and the sugar plantations: The missionary who came to give the bread of life remained to gobble up the whole heathen feast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是那并不是我开始说到的夏威夷的奇怪之处。只是谁提到夏威夷都免不了会涉及那些传道士。杰克·克斯代尔，就是我想谈论的人物，他出生在一个传教士家族。那是从他奶奶那边算的。他的爷爷老本杰明·克斯代尔，是美国北方的一个商人，过去靠贩卖廉价的威士忌酒和方瓶杜松子酒起家，挣了一百万美元。还有另外一件奇怪的事。那些老传道士和老商人是死对头。你知道的，他们有利益冲突。但是他们的子孙通过联姻和双方共同分割这个岛屿的方式化解了矛盾。</td>
		<td class="en">But that is not the Hawaiian queerness I started out to tell.Only one cannot speak of things Hawaiian without mentioning the missionaries.There is Jack Kersdale, the man I wanted to tell about; he came of missionary stock.That is, on his grandmother’s side.His grandfather was old Benjamin Kersdale, a Yankee trader, who got his start for a million in the old days by selling cheap whiskey and square-face gin.There’s another queer thing.The old missionaries and old traders were mortal enemies.You see, their interests conflicted.But their children made it up by intermarrying and dividing the island between them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >夏威夷的生活就像一首歌。正如斯托达德在他的“夏威夷之歌”中描绘的一样——</td>
		<td class="en">Life in Hawaii is a song.That’s the way Stoddard put it in his “Hawaii Noi”:—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的生活如歌——命运的音符延长！每一个小岛是一节诗，整片土地是一首歌。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Thy life is music—Fate the notes prolong!Each isle a stanza, and the whole a song.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他是对的。那里的人是金色的。土著女人是金黄色的朱诺，土著男人是古铜色的阿波罗。他们唱歌，跳舞，全都以花为饰，以花为冠。而且，除了那些顽固的“传教帮”，其他的白人顺从气候和太阳，而且无论有多忙，他们都喜欢唱歌跳舞，还在耳后和头发上戴上鲜花。杰克·克斯代尔就是这群人中的一个。他是我见过的最忙碌的人之一。他比百万富翁还要富有几倍。他是甘蔗大王、咖啡种植主、橡胶先驱、牧场主，岛上启动的新兴产业中的四分之三都是他倡导的。他是一个社交人物，爱去俱乐部，拥有游艇，是个单身，此外还是个深受有适婚女儿的妈妈们喜爱的美男子。顺便提一下，他毕业于耶鲁大学，脑子里装满了有关夏威夷的极其重要的数据和渊博的知识，在这方面懂得比我所见过的岛上其他任何一个人都要多。他放下无穷无尽的工作，也像游手好闲的人一样唱歌跳舞，还把鲜花插在头发上。</td>
		<td class="en">And he was right.Flesh is golden there.The native women are sun-ripe Junos, the native men bronzed Apollos.They sing, and dance, and all are flower-bejewelled and flower-crowned.And, outside the rigid “Missionary Crowd,” the white men yield to the climate and the sun, and no matter how busy they may be, are prone to dance and sing and wear flowers behind their ears and in their hair.Jack Kersdale was one of these fellows.He was one of the busiest men I ever met.He was a several-times millionaire.He was a sugar-king, a coffee planter, a rubber pioneer, a cattle rancher, and a promoter of three out of every four new enterprises launched in the islands.He was a society man, a club man, a yachtsman, a bachelor, and withal as handsome a man as was ever doted upon by mammas with marriageable daughters.Incidentally, he had finished his education at Yale, and his head was crammed fuller with vital statistics and scholarly information concerning Hawaii Nei than any other islander I ever encountered.He turned off an immense amount of work, and he sang and danced and put flowers in his hair as immensely as any of the idlers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他有勇气，还进行过两次决斗——两次都是政治方面的——那时他还只是一个初涉政坛的毛头小子。实际上，他在上一次革命中表现得非常可靠和勇敢，那次革命推翻了当地的王朝，而他那时应该还不到十六岁。我之所以指出他并不懦弱，是为了让你可以充分理解后来发生的事。我见到过他在哈莱阿卡拉大牧场的修理厂制服了一个四岁大的强壮牲畜，它两年来一直不让贵族坦普斯基的牧童牵。而且我必须要讲述另外一件事。那是在科纳的低处——或者相反，是在高处，因为科纳人不屑于住在低于一千英尺海拔的地方。我们都在古德休医生小屋的门廊处。事情发生时我正和多蒂·费尔柴尔德说话。一条大蜈蚣——有七英寸长，我们事后测量过——从头上方的椽子上落下来并直接掉进她的头发里。我承认，丑陋的蜈蚣把我吓得不知所措了。我动不了了。我的大脑也不转了。就在那里，在离我不到两英尺的地方，那条丑陋的毒蜈蚣正在她的头发里剧烈扭动。它随时都有可能掉到她袒露的肩膀上——我们刚吃完饭出来。</td>
		<td class="en">He had grit, and had fought two duels—both, political—when he was no more than a raw youth essaying his first adventures in politics.In fact, he played a most creditable and courageous part in the last revolution, when the native dynasty was overthrown; and he could not have been over sixteen at the time.I am pointing out that he was no coward, in order that you may appreciate what happens later on.I’ve seen him in the breaking yard at the Haleakala Ranch, conquering a four-year-old brute that for two years had defied the pick of Von Tempsky’s cow-boys.And I must tell of one other thing.It was down in Kona,—or up, rather, for the Kona people scorn to live at less than a thousand feet elevation.We were all on the lanai of Doctor Goodhue’s bungalow.I was talking with Dottie Fairchild when it happened.A big centipede—it was seven inches, for we measured it afterwards—fell from the rafters overhead squarely into her coiffure.I confess, the hideousness of it paralysed me.I couldn’t move.My mind refused to work.There, within two feet of me, the ugly venomous devil was writhing in her hair.It threatened at any moment to fall down upon her exposed shoulders—we had just come out from dinner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是什么？”她问道，开始把手伸向自己的头。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is it?” she asked, starting to raise her hand to her head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不要！”我喊道。“不要！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t!” I cried.“Don’t!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可那是什么啊？”她坚持问道，她从我惊恐的眼神和吞吐的话语中看出了恐惧，变得越来越害怕。</td>
		<td class="en">“But what is it?” she insisted, growing frightened by the fright she read in my eyes and on my stammering lips.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我的惊叫引起了克斯代尔的注意。他漫不经心地向我们这边瞥了一眼，但是这一眼让他看明白了一切。他朝我们走来，但却不慌不忙。</td>
		<td class="en">My exclamation attracted Kersdale’s attention.He glanced our way carelessly, but in that glance took in everything.He came over to us, but without haste.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请不要动，多蒂。”他轻声说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Please don’t move, Dottie,” he said quietly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他做事从不犹豫不决，也不慌里慌张地把事情弄得一团糟。</td>
		<td class="en">He never hesitated, nor did he hurry and make a bungle of it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让我来帮你。”他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Allow me,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一只手拿着多蒂的围巾，把它紧绕在她的肩膀上，这样蜈蚣就不会落到她的紧身胸衣里了。他的另一只手——右手——伸进多蒂的头发里，在接近她脖子后颈处抓住了令人讨厌的蜈蚣，然后他用拇指和食指紧紧抓着它，将它从她的头发里拿了出来。这一幕可怕却又英勇的场景正是人们希望看到的。它使我感觉心惊肉跳。那条蜈蚣七英寸长，扭动着腿，它的身体在他手中不停地扭动翻滚，还猛撞着他的手，它就像希望获得自由的野兽一样，把身体缠绕在他的手指上，把腿刺进他的皮肤里，还胡乱抓着。蜈蚣咬了他两次——我看见了——尽管他把它丢在路上、踩死在碎石中时还让女士们放心，说自己没有被伤到。但是事后五分钟我在诊所看到了他，古德休医生正在为他切开伤口，往里面注射高锰酸钾。第二天早上，克斯代尔的胳膊像桶一样粗，三个星期后才消肿。</td>
		<td class="en">And with one hand he caught her scarf and drew it tightly around her shoulders so that the centipede could not fall inside her bodice.With the other hand—the right—he reached into her hair, caught the repulsive abomination as near as he was able by the nape of the neck, and held it tightly between thumb and forefinger as he withdrew it from her hair.It was as horrible and heroic a sight as man could wish to see.It made my flesh crawl.The centipede, seven inches of squirming legs, writhed and twisted and dashed itself about his hand, the body twining around the fingers and the legs digging into the skin and scratching as the beast endeavoured to free itself.It bit him twice—I saw it—though he assured the ladies that he was not harmed as he dropped it upon the walk and stamped it into the gravel.But I saw him in the surgery five minutes afterwards, with Doctor Goodhue scarifying the wounds and injecting permanganate of potash.The next morning Kersdale’s arm was as big as a barrel, and it was three weeks before the swelling went down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一切都和我的故事无关，但是我不能省略这些，为的是证明杰克·克斯代尔绝对不是个懦夫。这是我见过的对勇气最清楚的展示。他从不慌里慌张。他总是微笑着。他把拇指和食指伸到多蒂·费尔柴尔德的头发里时是那么愉快，仿佛那是一盒咸味杏仁似的。然而我注定要看到这个人被恐惧击中，那种恐惧比我在多蒂·费尔柴尔德头上看到那只扭动着身子并在她眼睛和紧身胸衣上方晃来晃去的蜈蚣时的恐惧还要严重一千倍。</td>
		<td class="en">All of which has nothing to do with my story, but which I could not avoid giving in order to show that Jack Kersdale was anything but a coward.It was the cleanest exhibition of grit I have ever seen.He never turned a hair.The smile never left his lips.And he dived with thumb and forefinger into Dottie Fairchild’s hair as gaily as if it had been a box of salted almonds.Yet that was the man I was destined to see stricken with a fear a thousand times more hideous even than the fear that was mine when I saw that writhing abomination in Dottie Fairchild’s hair, dangling over her eyes and the trap of her bodice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我对麻风病感兴趣，而克斯代尔在这个方面就像岛上任何其他的话题一样，有着渊博的知识。实际上，麻风病是他的爱好之一。他强烈支持到莫洛凯岛定居，岛上所有的麻风病人都被隔离到那里。在煽动者的煽动之下，当地人对此事有很多交流和感受，担心莫洛凯岛那里会很残酷。那里的男人和女人不仅被从亲朋好友身边赶走，还不得不被永生监禁直至死亡。那里没有死刑撤销令，也没有减刑。“放弃希望”几个字写在了莫洛凯岛的入口。</td>
		<td class="en">I was interested in leprosy, and upon that, as upon every other island subject, Kersdale had encyclopedic knowledge.In fact, leprosy was one of his hobbies.He was an ardent defender of the settlement at Molokai, where all the island lepers were segregated.There was much talk and feeling among the natives, fanned by the demagogues, concerning the cruelties of Molokai, where men and women, not alone banished from friends and family, were compelled to live in perpetual imprisonment until they died.There were no reprieves, no commutations of sentences.“Abandon hope” was written over the portal of Molokai.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我跟你说，他们在那里很快乐，”克斯代尔坚持这样认为，“他们的境况比他们那些不在莫洛凯岛的身体健康的亲朋好友要好得多。说莫洛凯岛恐怖的，全是在胡说八道。我可以带着你去看看世界上任何一个大城市中的任何一家医院或者贫民窟，那里要比莫洛凯岛令你恐怖一千倍。那些生不如死的人！那些曾经还是人类的生物！胡说！你应该看看那些活死人在七月四号赛马的情形。他们中有些人拥有船。有个人还有油汽艇。他们除了好好享受生活外就没有什么事情可做了。食物、住所、衣服、医务护理，他们什么都有。他们是这片领土的守护者。他们那里的气候比火奴鲁鲁的还要好，而且风景壮丽秀美。我并不介意去那里度过余生。那是一个好地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I tell you they are happy there,” Kersdale insisted.“And they are infinitely better off than their friends and relatives outside who have nothing the matter with them.The horrors of Molokai are all poppycock.I can take you through any hospital or any slum in any of the great cities of the world and show you a thousand times worse horrors.The living death!The creatures that once were men!Bosh!You ought to see those living deaths racing horses on the Fourth of July.Some of them own boats.One has a gasoline launch.They have nothing to do but have a good time.Food, shelter, clothes, medical attendance, everything, is theirs.They are the wards of the Territory.They have a much finer climate than Honolulu, and the scenery is magnificent.I shouldn’t mind going down there myself for the rest of my days.It is a lovely spot.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以克斯代尔认为那些麻风病人是快乐的。他不害怕麻风病。这是他自己说的，还说对于他或者任何一个白人来说患上麻风病的几率不到百万分之一，尽管他事后也承认他的一位老校友艾尔弗雷德·斯塔特感染了麻风病，去了莫洛凯岛，并死在了那里。</td>
		<td class="en">So Kersdale on the joyous leper.He was not afraid of leprosy.He said so himself, and that there wasn’t one chance in a million for him or any other white man to catch it, though he confessed afterward that one of his school chums, Alfred Starter, had contracted it, gone to Molokai, and there died.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你知道的，在以前，”克斯代尔解释道，“麻风病是没有确定的检测方法的。任何不寻常或者不正常的症状都足以使一个人被送到莫洛凯岛。这导致许多跟你我一样没得麻风病的人被送到了那里。但是现在他们不会犯这样的错误了。健康委员会的检测绝对可靠。有趣的是他们一发现这个检测方法就立即到莫洛凯岛应用它了，结果他们发现许多人并没有患麻风病。这些人被立即驱逐了。他们高兴离开吗？他们离开那个拓居地时比他们从火奴鲁鲁离开去岛上的时候哭得还厉害。有些人拒绝离开，但他们真的必须被赶走。其中有一个人最后甚至和一个患麻风病的女人结了婚，然后给健康委员会写了一封令人同情的信，抗议自己被驱逐出这片土地，因为没有人能像他一样把他可怜又年迈的妻子照顾得这么好了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You know, in the old days,” Kersdale explained, “there was no certain test for leprosy.Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.The result was that dozens were sent there who were no more lepers than you or I.But they don’t make that mistake now.The Board of Health tests are infallible.The funny thing is that when the test was discovered they immediately went down to Molokai and applied it, and they found a number who were not lepers.These were immediately deported.Happy to get away?They wailed harder at leaving the settlement than when they left Honolulu to go to it.Some refused to leave, and really had to be forced out.One of them even married a leper woman in the last stages and then wrote pathetic letters to the Board of Health, protesting against his expulsion on the ground that no one was so well able as he to take care of his poor old wife.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那个可靠的检验是什么啊？”我询问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is this infallible test?”I demanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是细菌检验。它就没有出错的时候。赫维医生——他是我们的专家，你知道的——是第一个把它应用到这里的人。他是一个奇才。他比任何一个活着的人都了解麻风病，如果有朝一日有人发现了医治的方法，那肯定就是他发现的。至于那个测验，那很简单。他们已经成功分离并研究了麻风病菌。现在他们见到它就能认出来。他们所做的就是从疑似病人身上剪下一小点皮肤，对其进行细菌检验。一个没有任何明显症状的人的身上可能满是麻风病菌。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The bacteriological test.There is no getting away from it.Doctor Hervey—he’s our expert, you know—was the first man to apply it here.He is a wizard.He knows more about leprosy than any living man, and if a cure is ever discovered, he’ll be that discoverer.As for the test, it is very simple.They have succeeded in isolating the bacillus leprae and studying it.They know it now when they see it.All they do is to snip a bit of skin from the suspect and subject it to the bacteriological test.A man without any visible symptoms may be chock full of the leprosy bacilli.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们都知道，此时的你和我，”我表示道，“可能现在满身都是麻风病菌呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then you or I, for all we know,” I suggested, “may be full of it now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克斯代尔耸了耸肩，笑了。</td>
		<td class="en">Kersdale shrugged his shoulders and laughed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁说的好呢？麻风病要七年的时间才能逐渐形成。如果有任何疑问你可以去找赫维医生问一下。他只要剪下一点你的皮肤，马上就能让你知道答案。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Who can say?It takes seven years for it to incubate.If you have any doubts go and see Doctor Hervey.He’ll just snip out a piece of your skin and let you know in a jiffy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来他把我介绍给了赫维医生，赫维医生给我看了一大堆健康委员会的报告和有关那个主题的小册子，还带我去了火奴鲁鲁的接收站卡利，疑似病人都在那里接受检查，而确诊的麻风病人被留下来驱逐到莫洛凯岛去。这样的驱逐大约每月一次，说完最后的再见之后，麻风病人被强行带到一艘叫诺伊厄号的小汽船上，被载到拓居地去。</td>
		<td class="en">Later on he introduced me to Dr. Hervey, who loaded me down with Board of Health reports and pamphlets on the subject, and took me out to Kalihi, the Honolulu receiving station, where suspects were examined and confirmed lepers were held for deportation to Molokai.These deportations occurred about once a month, when, the last good-byes said, the lepers were marched on board the little steamer, the Noeau, and carried down to the settlement.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天下午，我正在俱乐部里写信，杰克·克斯代尔顺道来拜访我。</td>
		<td class="en">One afternoon, writing letters at the club, Jack Kersdale dropped in on me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我正找你呢，”他对我打招呼道，“我让你看看整个事件中最令人痛心的一面——麻风病人离开这里去莫洛凯岛时都在大声痛哭。几分钟后他们就要登上诺伊厄号了。但是我要提醒你，不要觉得难过。他们真的是很悲伤，但一年以后如果健康委员会试图把他们从莫洛凯岛带走，他们会哭得更加厉害。我们的时间还够喝杯加苏打水的威士忌酒。我有一辆马车在外面。我们五分钟都用不了就能到码头了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Just the man I want to see,” was his greeting.“I’ll show you the saddest aspect of the whole situation—the lepers wailing as they depart for Molokai.The Noeau will be taking them on board in a few minutes.But let me warn you not to let your feelings be harrowed.Real as their grief is, they’d wail a whole sight harder a year hence if the Board of Health tried to take them away from Molokai.We’ve just time for a whiskey and soda.I’ve a carriage outside.It won’t take us five minutes to get down to the wharf.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们的马车朝码头驶去。大约有四十来个悲伤的可怜虫，正蹲坐在纵桁上，周围都是他们的垫子、毛毯和各种行李。　　诺伊厄号刚到岸，正在码头和船之间绑上一个驳船。那块拓居地的负责人是一位叫麦克维的先生，他正监管着那些人搭船，克斯代尔把我介绍给他，还把我介绍给乔治斯医生，我在卡利的健康委员会曾经见过他。麻风病人都很愁眉苦脸的。大部分人的脸都很丑陋——可怕得让我难以形容。但到处都可以看见相当好看的人，他们身上没有明显的疾病降临的迹象。我注意到一个白人小女孩，不过十二岁，长着蓝色的眼睛和金黄的头发。然而，她的一侧脸颊却因麻风病而肿胀。我谈到，在一群棕色皮肤的麻风病人中间，这个小女孩是一个异类，这真是件悲哀的事，这时乔治斯医生回答道——</td>
		<td class="en">To the wharf we drove.Some forty sad wretches, amid their mats, blankets, and luggage of various sorts, were squatting on the stringer piece.The Noeau had just arrived and was making fast to a lighter that lay between her and the wharf.A Mr. McVeigh, the superintendent of the settlement, was overseeing the embarkation, and to him I was introduced, also to Dr. Georges, one of the Board of Health physicians whom I had already met at Kalihi.The lepers were a woebegone lot.The faces of the majority were hideous—too horrible for me to describe.But here and there I noticed fairly good-looking persons, with no apparent signs of the fell disease upon them.One, I noticed, a little white girl, not more than twelve, with blue eyes and golden hair.One cheek, however, showed the leprous bloat.On my remarking on the sadness of her alien situation among the brown-skinned afflicted ones, Doctor Georges replied:—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我不了解。在她的生命中今天是个值得高兴的日子。她来自考爱岛。她的爸爸是个没有人性的家伙。而既然她得了这个病，她就可以到拓居地和她的妈妈团聚了。她的妈妈三年前被送到那里——是一个很严重的病例。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I don’t know.It’s a happy day in her life.She comes from Kauai.Her father is a brute.And now that she has developed the disease she is going to join her mother at the settlement.Her mother was sent down three years ago—a very bad case.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不能总是从表象上看，”麦克维先生解释道，“那边的那个人，那个高大的小伙子，他看起来身体状况很好，似乎没有什么病，但是我碰巧知道他脚上有一块穿透的溃疡，肩胛骨上也有一块。然后还有别的人——在那边，看到那个女孩的手了吧，就是正在抽烟的那个女孩。看到她扭曲的手指了吧。那是服麻醉剂的表现，已经侵害到神经了。你可以用一把钝刀把她的手指切掉，或用肉豆蔻磨碎器把它磨去，她不会有一丁点儿感觉。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You can’t always tell from appearances,” Mr. McVeigh explained.“That man there, that big chap, who looks the pink of condition, with nothing the matter with him, I happen to know has a perforating ulcer in his foot and another in his shoulder-blade.Then there are others—there, see that girl’s hand, the one who is smoking the cigarette.See her twisted fingers.That’s the anaesthetic form.It attacks the nerves.You could cut her fingers off with a dull knife, or rub them off on a nutmeg-grater, and she would not experience the slightest sensation.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，但是那个漂亮女人，在那边，”我执意问道，“她肯定没有问题吧，绝对是，绝对的。她是那么的美丽而迷人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, but that fine-looking woman, there,” I persisted; “surely, surely, there can’t be anything the matter with her.She is too glorious and gorgeous altogether.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很不幸的一例。”麦克维转过头答道，他已经和克斯代尔一起转身离开，向码头走去了。</td>
		<td class="en">“A sad case,” Mr. McVeigh answered over his shoulder, already turning away to walk down the wharf with Kersdale.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是个漂亮的女人，而且是纯正的波利尼西亚人。以我对这个民族及其特征的粗略了解，我不得不推测出她是部落首领的后裔。她年龄不超过二十三或二十四岁。她的线条和比例都是那么完美，而且她才刚刚开始展现出她的民族的女人所具有的魅力。</td>
		<td class="en">She was a beautiful woman, and she was pure Polynesian.From my meagre knowledge of the race and its types I could not but conclude that she had descended from old chief stock.She could not have been more than twenty-three or four.Her lines and proportions were magnificent, and she was just beginning to show the amplitude of the women of her race.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们都为此感到震惊，”乔治斯医生主动说，“她也是自愿报上病情来的。没有人怀疑过她。但是她不知怎么感染了麻风病。我们大家都惊呆了，我向你保证。可是，我们没有把她记录在案。除了我们和她的家人，再没有人知道她发生了什么。实际上，如果你问火奴鲁鲁的任何一个人，他都会告诉你在他的印象中她去了欧洲的某个地方。是她请求我们对此事保密的。可怜的女孩，她的自尊心很强。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It was a blow to all of us,” Dr. Georges volunteered.“She gave herself up voluntarily, too.No one suspected.But somehow she had contracted the disease.It broke us all up, I assure you.We’ve kept it out of the papers, though.Nobody but us and her family knows what has become of her.In fact, if you were to ask any man in Honolulu, he’d tell you it was his impression that she was somewhere in Europe.It was at her request that we’ve been so quiet about it.Poor girl, she has a lot of pride.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是她是谁啊？”我问道，“当然，从你谈论她的方式来推断，她肯定是个人物。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But who is she?”I asked.“Certainly, from the way you talk about her, she must be somebody.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你听说过露西·莫库纽伊吗？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did you ever hear of Lucy Mokunui?” he asked.</td></tr>
