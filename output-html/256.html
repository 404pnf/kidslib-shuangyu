		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在她父亲眼里，她就是公主。而对于在波士顿的舅舅舅妈们来说，她仅仅是个可怜的小孩子多利·厄克特。</td>
		<td class="en">To her father, she was The Princess.To her Boston aunts and uncles she was just Dollie Urquhart, poor little thing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >科林·厄克特只是有点疯疯癫癫的。他出身于一个古老的苏格兰家庭，自称有王室血统。他身上流淌着苏格兰王室的血液。对于这件事情，他的美国亲戚们认为，他只是有点“不正常”。他们早听厌了他和苏格兰王室有血缘关系的这些话。整个事情都极其荒谬，令人恼火。他们只记得一件事，就是他不姓斯图亚特。</td>
		<td class="en">Colin Urquhart was just a bit mad.He was of an old Scottish family, and he claimed royal blood.The blood of Scottish kings flowed in his veins.On this point, his American relatives said, he was just a bit “off”.They could not bear any more to be told which royal blood of Scotland blued his veins.The whole thing was rather ridiculous, and a sore point.The only fact they remembered was that it was not Stuart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他是个英俊的男人，一双蓝蓝的大眼睛有时看起来空洞无物；低平、宽阔的额头上梳着一头软软的黑发；身材挺拔。此外，他有悦耳动听的嗓音。这声音平时十分低沉谦恭，但有时也会像洪钟一样响亮有力。这就是他的全部魅力。 他看起来就像某个古老的凯尔特英雄。他似乎本应该穿一条浅灰色的苏格兰方格呢短裙，扎一条毛皮袋，并且露着两只膝盖。他的嗓音直接传承自古老的英雄诗人奥西恩低沉的嗓音。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a handsome man, with a wide-open blue eye that seemed sometimes to be looking at nothing, soft black hair brushed rather low on his low, broad brow, and a very attractive body.Add to this a most beautiful speaking voice, usually rather hushed and diffident, but sometimes resonant and powerful like bronze, and you have the sum of his charms.He looked like some old Celtic hero.He looked as if he should have worn a greyish kilt and a sporran, and shown his knees.His voice came direct out of the hushed Ossianic past.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于其他方面，他算得上一位家境殷实但并不十分阔绰的绅士。五十年前，这些绅士毫无目的地游手好闲，他们从未达成过任何目标，从未做成过任何事，也从未真正成为过任何栋梁之才。然而，他们却受到不止一个国家上流社会的热烈欢迎。</td>
		<td class="en">For the rest, he was one of those gentlemen of sufficient but not excessive means who fifty years ago wandered vaguely about, never arriving anywhere, never doing anything, and never definitely being anything, yet well received in the good society of more than one country.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他将近四十才结婚，娶的是来自新英格兰的有钱姑娘普雷斯科特。二十二岁的汉纳·普雷斯科特被这位拥有一头松软乌黑、尚未灰白的黑发男人吸引住了，他蓝蓝的眼睛大而朦胧。在她之前，也曾有过很多女人对他着迷。但是科林·厄克特以他一贯模棱两可的态度避免了确定任何关系。</td>
		<td class="en">He did not marry till he was nearly forty, and then it was a wealthy Miss Prescott, from New England.Hannah Prescott at twenty-two was fascinated by the man with the soft black hair not yet touched by grey, and the wide, rather vague blue eyes.Many women had been fascinated before her.But Colin Urquhart, by his very vagueness, had avoided any decisive connection.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >厄克特夫人在他丈夫的朦胧魅惑中生活了三年。后来，她再也受不了了。她活像和一个迷人的幽灵生活在一起。对于大多数事情，他都全然无知，甚至像幽灵一样健忘。他那低沉悦耳的声音总是魅力十足、彬彬有礼、亲切和蔼。但也总是心不在焉的。总而言之，他就是有点迷糊。就像俗话说的，“有点失常”。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Urquhart lived three years in the mist and glamour of her husband’s presence.And then it broke her.It was like living with a fascinating spectre.About most things he was completely, even ghostly oblivious.He was always charming, courteous, perfectly gracious in that hushed, musical voice of his.But absent.When all came to all, he just wasn’t there.“Not all there,” as the vulgar say.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在婚后的第一年年末，她生下了一个小女孩，他成了父亲。但这并没有让他清醒一些。没过几个月，她就有些害怕他英俊的外表和他那令人难忘的、动听的声音了。他整个人就像活着的回声一样，奇怪的回声！他的肌肤摸上去不大像一个真人的肌肤。</td>
		<td class="en">He was the father of the little girl she bore at the end of the first year.But this did not substantiate him the more.His very beauty and his haunting musical quality became dreadful to her after the first few months.The strange echo: he was like a living echo!His very flesh, when you touched it, did not seem quite the flesh of a real man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >或许，这是因为他有点疯狂的缘故。她在孩子出生的那天晚上就确实这样想过。</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps it was that he was a little bit mad.She thought it definitely the night her baby was born.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我的小公主终于来了！”他用凯尔特人低沉洪亮的声音说道，就像是在唱一首欢乐的圣歌，全神贯注，声音悠扬婉转。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah, so my little princess has come at last!” he said, in his throaty, singing Celtic voice, like a glad chant, swaying absorbed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >婴儿瘦小、孱弱，睁着一双惊奇而湛蓝的大眼睛。他们给孩子取教名叫“玛丽·亨里埃塔”。她母亲管孩子叫“我的多利”。他却总是叫她“我的公主”。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a tiny, frail baby, with wide, amazed blue eyes.They christened it Mary Henrietta.She called the little thing My Dollie.He called it always My Princess.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对他发火一点用都没有。他只是把那双大大的蓝眼睛睁得更大，一脸平静，带着孩子般的尊严，眼神中空洞无物。</td>
		<td class="en">It was useless to fly at him.He just opened his wide blue eyes wider, and took a child-like, silent dignity there was no getting past.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >汉纳·普雷斯科特一直以来身体都很虚弱。她并不奢望长寿。因此，在婴儿刚满两岁时，她就突然撒手人寰了。</td>
		<td class="en">Hannah Prescott had never been robust.She had no great desire to live.So when the baby was two years old she suddenly died.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >普雷斯科特的娘家人对科林·厄克特有着深深的不满，但他们并不承认。他们说他很自私。将汉纳在佛罗伦萨安葬一个月后，他们要求厄克特把女儿交给他们抚养，而他则彬彬有礼、声音悦耳地断然拒绝了这个请求。于是，汉纳的家人不再给他提供汉纳的那份收入所得。他对待普雷斯科特家的人就像他们并不属于他的世界，也不是实际存在的人，他们只是临时性地存在，或者像一台台必须答复的留声机。他答复他们。但是对于他们的真实存在，他却从未意识到。</td>
		<td class="en">The Prescotts felt a deep but unadmitted resentment against Colin Urquhart.They said he was selfish.Therefore they discontinued Hannah’s income, a month after her burial in Florence, after they had urged the father to give the child over to them, and he had courteously, musically, but quite finally refused.He treated the Prescotts as if they were not of his world, not realities to him: just casual phenomena, or gramophones, talking-machines that had to be answered.He answered them.But of their actual existence he was never once aware.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >普雷斯科特家的人原本打算设法证明他并不适合做孩子的监护人。但那会成为一桩丑闻。所以，他们最后做了件最简单的事情——对他的事不闻不问。不过，他们依然认真地给孩子写信，并在圣诞节和她母亲忌日的时候适度地寄给她一些钱当礼物。</td>
		<td class="en">They debated having him certified unsuitable to be guardian of his own child.But that would have created a scandal.So they did the simplest thing, after all—washed their hands of him.But they wrote scrupulously to the child, and sent her modest presents of money at Christmas, and on the anniversary of the death of her mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于这位“公主”来说，这么多年以来，她在波士顿的亲戚们只是有名无实而已。她和父亲一起生活。父亲不断迁徙，但开销比较有节制。他们靠着父亲的平平收入过活。不过父亲从来不去美国。孩子则不断地更换保姆。在意大利，保姆是一名农妇；在印度，是一个女佣；在德国，则是一个黄头发的农村姑娘。</td>
		<td class="en">To The Princess her Boston relatives were for many years just a nominal reality.She lived with her father, and he travelled continually, though in a modest way, living on his moderate income.And never going to America.The child changed nurses all the time.In Italy it was a contadina; in India she had an ayah; in Germany she had a yellow-haired peasant girl.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >父亲和孩子形影不离。他不是一个隐士。不论走到哪里，总看到他走亲访友、出门赴午宴或者喝茶，偶尔也去吃晚饭。他总是带着孩子一起。人们管她叫“厄克特公主”，就像这是她的教名一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Father and child were inseparable.He was not a recluse.Wherever he went he was to be seen paying formal calls going out to luncheon or to tea, rarely to dinner.And always with the child.People called her Princess Urquhart, as if that were her christened name.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是一个聪明、俊俏的小姑娘，长着一头略显褐色的金发，一双略微凸出的蓝色大眼睛显得坦诚而又精明。她总是显得很成熟；可她却从来没有真正长大过。她总是异常伶俐，又总是十分幼稚。</td>
		<td class="en">She was a quick, dainty little thing with dark gold hair that went a soft brown, and wide, slightly prominent blue eyes that were at once so candid and so knowing.She was always grown up; she never really grew up.Always strangely wise, and always childish.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是她父亲的错。</td>
		<td class="en">It was her father’s fault.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的小公主，你永远不必过分在意他人，也不必在乎他们说或做的事。”他反复对她说，“他们对自己做的和说的事，自己都搞不清楚。他们说长道短，他们彼此伤害，而且他们也经常伤到自己，直到他们为此痛哭不已。不过，我的小公主，你不必在意这些。因为这些都毫无意义。在每个人的内心都有另一个自我，一个对一切都不在意的魔鬼。你可以剥离他们所说的、所做的，以及感觉到的一切东西，就像厨子剥掉一层层的洋葱皮那样。而每个人的内心最后都有一个你剥不掉的绿色恶魔。这个绿魔永远不变，它对发生在外部世界的所有事情，所有的流言蜚语、儿女情长、生活烦恼和小题大做都根本不在乎。你把人身上所有的东西都剥离了，就剩下这个诚实的绿魔。它存在于所有的男人和女人心中；这个魔鬼才是男人和女人的真正自我。它并不真的关心任何人，它是从不关心人的魔鬼和原始精灵。但即便如此，魔鬼也有高尚和卑鄙之分，精灵也有优雅和粗俗之别。但却没有王室的女精灵存在。只有你，我的小公主，你是个例外。你是昔日王族最后的后裔；我的公主，你是最后一个。再没有其他人了。你和我是仅存的。等我一死，就只剩你一个了。亲爱的，这就是为什么你永远不必太过在乎世上其他人的原因。因为他们的绿魔全都渺小而鄙俗。他们不是王族之人。除我之外，只有你是王族。你要永远记住这点。永远记住，这是最大的秘密。如果你告诉了别人，他们会设法杀了你，因为他们会嫉妒你是公主。亲爱的，这是我们最大的秘密。我是王子，你是公主，我们都属于最古老的血统。我们各自保守这个秘密吧。因此，亲爱的，你必须非常礼貌地对待所有人，因为王公贵族必须如此。但你永远不要忘记，只有你才是最后的公主。世上的其他人都不如你，他们没你高贵，比你粗俗。亲爱的，你要温文尔雅、亲和友善地对待他们。但你是公主，他们是平民。决不能把他们看成是和你一样的人。他们和你不同。你总是会发现，他们根本没有王族的气魄，而这种气魄，只有你有——”</td>
		<td class="en">“My little Princess must never take too much notice of people and the things they say and do,” he repeated to her.“People don’t know what they are doing and saying.They chatter-chatter, and they hurt one another, and they hurt themselves very often, till they cry.But don’t take any notice, my little Princess.Because it is all nothing.Inside everybody there is another creature, a demon which doesn’t care at all.You peel away all the things they say and do and feel, as cook peels away the outside of the onions.And in the middle of everybody there is a green demon which you can’t peel away.And this green demon never changes, and it doesn’t care at all about all the things that happen to the outside leaves of the person, all the chatter-chatter, and all the husbands and wives and children, and troubles and fusses.You peel everything away from people, and there is a green, upright demon in every man and woman; and this demon is a man’s real self, and a woman’s real self.It doesn’t really care about anybody, it belongs to the demons and the primitive fairies, who never care.But, even so, there are big demons and mean demons, and splendid demonish fairies, and vulgar ones.But there are no royal fairy women left.Only you, my little Princess.You are the last of the royal race of the old people; the last, my Princess.There are no others.You and I are the last.When I am dead there will be only you.And that is why, darling, you will never care for any of the people in the world very much.Because their demons are all dwindled and vulgar.They are not royal.Only you are royal, after me.Always remember that.And always remember, it is a great secret.If you tell people, they will try to kill you, because they will envy you for being a Princess.It is our great secret, darling.I am a prince, and you a princess, of the old, old blood.And we keep our secret between us, all alone.And so, darling, you must treat all people very politely, because noblesse oblige.But you must never forget that you alone are the last of Princesses, and that all other are less than you are, less noble, more vulgar.Treat them politely and gently and kindly, darling.But you are the Princess, and they are commoners.Never try to think of them as if they were like you.They are not.You will find, always, that they are lacking, lacking in the royal touch, which only you have—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >公主很早就受到启蒙——人生第一课便是保持绝对沉默，除父亲外，不能与其他任何人亲近；第二课，要朴实、与人为善、彬彬有礼。尽管还是个小孩子，她性格的一部分却已经成形了。她纯洁、完美，且如水晶般百毒不侵。</td>
		<td class="en">The Princess learned her lesson early—the first lesson, of absolute reticence, the impossibility of intimacy with any other than her father; the second lesson, of naïve, slightly benevolent politeness.As a small child, something crystallised in her character, making her clear and finished, and as impervious as crystal.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可爱的孩子！”她的女房东们这样评价她，“她这么优雅，又这么老成；真是个淑女，可怜的小东西！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Dear child!” her hostesses said of her.“She is so quaint and old-fashioned; such a lady, poor little mite!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她身形笔直，小巧玲珑。她体形总是很瘦小，几乎是个小不点，在身材高大、相貌英俊、有点疯癫的父亲身边，看起来像个低能儿。她穿着非常朴素，衣裳不是蓝色就是浅灰色，领口很小，镶着旧式的米兰针绣花边或是做工十分精细的亚麻布。她的小手非常纤细，当她弹钢琴时，那琴声听起来就像是古琴发出的。去外面的时候，她喜欢穿着披风和披肩，而不是大衣，并且喜欢戴着十八世纪风格的小帽子。她的肤色就像纯净的苹果花的颜色。</td>
		<td class="en">She was erect, and very dainty.Always small, nearly tiny in physique, she seemed like a changeling beside her big, handsome, slightly mad father.She dressed very simply, usually in blue or delicate greys, with little collars of old Milan point, or very finely-worked linen.She had exquisite little hands, that made the piano sound like a spinet when she played.She was rather given to wearing cloaks and capes, instead of coats, out of doors, and little eighteenth-century sort of hats.Her complexion was pure apple-blossom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她看起来就像是从画里走出来的。但直到她临死的一天，也没有人真正了解过那幅奇怪的画究竟什么样，她父亲把她框在这画里，而她也从来没有从那里走出来过。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的外祖父母和她的莫德姨妈曾两次要求探望她，一次在罗马，一次在巴黎。每次他们都被她吸引，却又都被她激怒、被她惹恼了。她是如此优雅，是个如此清纯的小小处女。同时，她又如此世故、异常自信。那种古怪、自信的屈尊之态和她内心的冷漠使她的美国亲戚们非常恼火。</td>
		<td class="en">Her grandfather and grandmother and her Aunt Maud demanded twice to see her, once in Rome and once in Paris.Each time they were charmed, piqued, and annoyed.She was so exquisite and such a little virgin.At the same time so knowing and so oddly assured.That odd, assured touch of condescension, and the inward coldness, infuriated her American relations.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过她的确吸引住了她的外祖父。他对她着了迷；在某种程度上，他爱上了这个完美无瑕的小姑娘。见面后好几个月，他妻子还能看见他独自沉思，想念他的外孙女，并渴望再次见到她。他直到临终还怀着热切的希望，盼着她可以来和他们夫妻俩生活在一起。</td>
		<td class="en">Only she really fascinated her grandfather.He was spellbound; in a way, in love with the little faultless thing.His wife would catch him brooding, musing over his grandchild, long months after the meeting, and craving to see her again.He cherished to the end the fond hope that she might come to live with him and her grandmother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“非常感谢您，外公。您可真好。可是爸爸和我这么多年一直两个人做伴，您瞧，我们俩相依为命，生活在我们自己的世界里。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的父亲让她认识这个世界——从局外人的角度。而且他还让她读书。她十几岁时便读了左拉和莫泊桑的作品，而且她还透过左拉和莫泊桑的视角来审视巴黎。稍后，她又阅读了托尔斯泰和陀思妥耶夫斯基的著作。后者让她很困惑。至于其他作品，凭着聪颖的天资及敏锐的理解力，她似乎都能读懂，就像她能读懂古意大利文的《十日谈》，或是《尼伯龙根之歌》那样。奇怪而又不可思议的是，她似乎完全以一种冷冰冰的眼光看待世事，没有一丝激情。她就像个低能儿，不太像正常人。</td>
		<td class="en">Her father let her see the world—from the outside.And he let her read.When she was in her teens she read Zola and Maupassant, and with the eyes of Zola and Maupassant she looked on Paris.A little later she read Tolstoi and Dostoevsky.The latter confused her.The others, she seemed to understand with a very shrewd, canny understanding, just as she understood the Decameron stories as she read them in their old Italian, or the Nibelung poems.Strange and uncanny, she seemed to understand things in a cold light perfectly, with all the flush of fire absent.She was something like a changeling, not quite human.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这也为她招致了莫名其妙的反感。当她独自一人的时候，出租马车车夫和铁路行李搬运工会突然粗暴无礼地对待她，尤其是在巴黎和罗马。他们好像带着一种突然爆发的、粗暴的反感情绪看待她。他们从她古怪、无礼的神态中，察觉到她对他们最引以为傲的东西表现得轻慢无礼、不屑一顾。她是如此自负，而她的少女情怀又是那么的单调乏味。她看待一个健壮、性感的罗马车夫就好像他是某种让她发笑的怪物。在左拉的作品里，她了解了关于车夫的一切。她会居高临下地告诉他她的目的地，仿佛只有柔弱美丽的她才是唯一的、真正的人，而他，粗俗的丑八怪，则只是个半人半兽的怪物，只配在开满美丽莲花的池塘边的泥土里打滚。正是她这种神情会突然激怒车夫，因为作为地道的地中海人，他对自己的阳刚之美引以为傲，并且在他看来，雄性的奥秘仍是唯一的奥秘。于是他会转过脸，对她怒目而视，以野蛮、粗鲁的方式欺负她——非常可怕。因为对他来说，她也只是一个亵渎神明、傲慢无礼、发育不良的女人。</td>
		<td class="en">This earned her, also, strange antipathies.Cabmen and railway porters, especially in Paris and Rome, would suddenly treat her with brutal rudeness, when she was alone.They seemed to look on her with sudden violent antipathy.They sensed in her curious impertinence, an easy, sterile impertinence towards the things they felt most.She was so assured, and her flower of maidenhood was so scentless.She could look at a lusty, sensual Roman cabman as if he were a sort of grotesque, to make her smile.She knew all about him, in Zola.And the peculiar condescension with which she would give him her order, as if she, frail, beautiful thing, were the only reality, and he, coarse monster, was a sort of Caliban floundering in the mud on the margin of the pool of the perfect lotus, would suddenly enrage the fellow, the real Mediterranean who prided himself on his beauté male, and to whom the phallic mystery was still the only mystery.And he would turn a terrible face on her, bully her in a brutal, coarse fashion—hideous.For to him she had only the blasphemous impertinence of her own sterility.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >类似这样的遭遇使她害怕，也使她明白，她必须得到外部世界的支持。她的精神力量无法触及这些下等人，而他们却具有强大的肉体力量。她从他们对她的怒气中看到了无情的憎恶。但她并没有仓皇失措。她从容地付钱，然后转身离开。</td>
		<td class="en">Encounters like these made her tremble, and made her know she must have support from the outside.The power of her spirit did not extend to these low people, and they had all the physical power.She realised an implacability of hatred in their turning on her.But she did not lose her head.She quietly paid out money and turned away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，这种情况毕竟很危险，于是她开始学着对此有所准备。她是公主，从北方来的精灵。她永远无法理解那些粗野的人在对她的仇恨突然发作时所爆发出的强烈、充满男性气息的愤怒。他们从不会对她父亲那样发火。而她很早就认定，他们憎恨她，是因为她体内那来自新英格兰州的母亲的血统。她一刻也不能以原始罗马人的眼光看待自己，把自己看成是发育不良之人，看成装模作样的无果之花，或是令人无法容忍的无礼之人。而罗马车夫就是这样看待她的。并且他渴望把这朵无果之花压碎。她无关性感的美丽和她盛气凌人的权威一下激起了他粗鲁反抗的热情。</td>
		<td class="en">Those were dangerous moments, though, and she learned to be prepared for them.The Princess she was, and the fairy from the North, and could never understand the volcanic phallic rage with which coarse people could turn on her in a paroxysm of hatred.They never turned on her father like that.And quite early she decided it was the New England mother in her whom they hated.Never for one minute could she see with the old Roman eyes, see herself as sterility, the barren flower taking on airs and an intolerable impertinence.This was what the Roman cabman saw in her.And he longed to crush the barren blossom.Its sexless beauty and its authority put him in a passion of brutal revolt.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从那往后，一个新时期便开始了。父亲和女儿或在五大湖岸边，或在加利福尼亚州，或在美国西南部度过他们的夏天。父亲有几分诗人气质，女儿也多少算得上是个画家。他写诗歌咏湖泊或是红木树林，而女儿则绘出美丽的图画。他身体强壮，热爱户外活动。他常带着女儿外出几天，驾只独木舟在湖上荡桨，晚上则睡在篝火旁边。柔弱的小公主，她总是很勇敢，永远那么勇敢。她会骑马和父亲一起走过山道，直到她累得好像已经没有了身体，只剩下她的意识还骑在马背上。但她从不服输。晚上，父亲给她裹上毯子，把她放在松树枝铺成的床上。她躺在那里，仰望星空，从不抱怨。她是在履行自己的职责。</td>
		<td class="en">There began a new phase, when the father and daughter spent their summers on the Great Lakes or in California, or in the South-West.The father was something of a poet, the daughter something of a painter.He wrote poems about the lakes or the redwood trees, and she made dainty drawings.He was physically a strong man, and he loved the out-of-doors.He would go off with her for days, paddling in a canoe and sleeping by a camp-fire.Frail little Princess, she was always undaunted, always undaunted.She would ride with him on horseback over the mountain trails till she was so tired she was nothing but a bodiless consciousness sitting astride her pony.But she never gave in.And at night he folded her in her blanket on a bed of balsam pine twigs, and she lay and looked at the stars unmurmuring.She was fulfilling her rôle.</td></tr>
