		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >斯塔顿·戴维斯和吉姆·外姆普停止了谈话，听着街上的越来越大的吵闹声。一阵乱石敲打着保护窗户的金属网纱，发出隆隆的声响。这是一个燥热的夜晚，他们听着外面的声音，热得脸上布满了汗水。暴民断断续续的叫嚷此起彼伏，不时被某声带着墨西哥当地西班牙语腔调的叫喊声打断。在这些可恶的威胁中，最不那么糟糕的是：“外国佬，去见鬼吧！”“宰了这些美国猪！”“把这些美国狗丢到海里淹死！”</td>
		<td class="en">Stanton Davies and Jim Wemple ceased from their talk to listen to an increase of uproar in the street.A volley of stones thrummed and boomed the wire mosquito nettings that protected the windows.It was a hot night, and the sweat of the heat stood on their faces as they listened.Arose the incoherent clamor of the mob, punctuated by individual cries in Mexican-Spanish.Least terrible among the obscene threats were: “Death to the Gringos!”“Kill the American pigs!”“Drown the American dogs in the sea!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >斯塔顿·戴维斯和吉姆·外姆普耐心地向对方耸耸肩膀，重新交谈起来。他们提高了声音，好盖过外面的喧嚣，让对方听见。</td>
		<td class="en">Stanton Davies and Jim Wemple shrugged their shoulders patiently to each other, and resumed their conversation, talking louder in order to make themselves heard above the uproar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“问题是怎么做，”外姆普说道，“坐船到帕努科河要47英里——”</td>
		<td class="en">“The question is how,” Wemple said. “It’s forty-seven miles to Panuco, by river—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“走陆路根本不可能，会遇到萨拉戈萨人和维拉人的抢劫，他们可能正打得火热呢。”戴维斯表示同意。</td>
		<td class="en">“And the land’s impossible, with Zaragoza’s and Villa’s men on the loot and maybe fraternizing,” Davies agreed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外姆普点点头，继续说道：“她如果没回狩猎营地，就是在东海岸马格诺利亚地区，也就是还要走两英里远。我们必须找到她——”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们在这件事上观点很一致，外姆普，”戴维斯说，“而且我们也可以坦诚相对，说说彼此知道对方了解多少。你想要她。我也想要她。”</td>
		<td class="en">“We’ve played pretty square in this matter, Wemple,” Davies said. “And we might as well speak up and acknowledge what each of us knows the other knows.You want her.I want her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外姆普点了一根烟，点了点头。</td>
		<td class="en">Wemple lighted a cigarette and nodded.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“And a truce until we do save her—I get you,” Wemple affirmed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们一直停战到把她完好无损地救回坦皮科，或是把她送上战船为止。在那之后……”</td>
		<td class="en">“A truce until we get her safe and sound back here in Tampico, or aboard a battleship.After that...?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个人都耸了耸肩，握手达成协议，向对方露出了笑脸。</td>
		<td class="en">Both men shrugged shoulders and beamed on each other as their hands met in ratification.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >又一阵乱石砸在罩着铁丝的窗户上。一个男孩的声音在喧嚣声中刺耳地响起来，叫喊着让外国佬见鬼去。房子里回响着撞车在楼下撞击临街门的沉重响声。这两个人都抓起自动步枪，跑到火力可以控制这个受威胁的门的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Fresh volleys of stones thrummed against the wire-screened windows; a boy’s voice rose shrilly above the clamor, proclaiming death to the Gringos; and the house reverberated to the heavy crash of some battering ram against the street-door downstairs.Both men, snatching up automatic rifles, ran down to where their fire could command the threatened door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果他们冲进来，我们就不得不让他们吃枪子儿了。”外姆普说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“If they break in we’ve got to let them have it,” Wemple said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戴维斯点头表示无声的赞同，接着突然变了脸色，嘴里冒出一连串可怕的咒骂。</td>
		<td class="en">Davies nodded quiet agreement, then inconsistently burst out with a lurid string of oaths.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“想想看！”他解释了自己的愤怒，“外面的那些杂种里，有三分之一给你或我干过活——他们饿着肚子，光着脚，受着穷，只要有活干，一天赚10分钱也很乐意。我们已经给了他们稳定的工作，还有一天150分的工资，而他们却在这里，叫喊着要我们的血。”</td>
		<td class="en">“To think of it!” he explained his wrath. “One out of three of those curs outside has worked for you or me—lean-bellied, bare-footed, poverty-stricken, glad for ten centavos a day if they could only get work.And we’ve given them steady jobs and a hundred and fifty centavos a day, and here they are yelling for our blood.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这些人里有一半。”戴维斯纠正道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Only the half breeds;” Davies corrected.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你知道我是什么意思。”外姆普答道,“我们失去的雇工只是那些逃跑的或被枪毙的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You know what I mean,” Wemple replied. “The only peons we’ve lost are those that have been run off or shot.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对门的攻击停止了，两人就回到了楼上。从街上远处传来的零星的枪声似乎驱走了暴民，附近和之前相比变得相对安静些了。</td>
		<td class="en">The attack on the door ceasing, they returned upstairs.Half a dozen scattered shots from farther along the street seemed to draw away the mob, for the neighborhood became comparatively quiet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从敞开的窗户外面传来一声口哨，还有一个男人的声音：</td>
		<td class="en">A whistle came to them through the open windows, and a man’s voice calling:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“外姆普！开门！我是哈伯特！我想和你谈谈！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wemple!Open the door!It’s Habert!Want to talk to you!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外姆普下了楼，几分钟之后回来了，带回来一个50岁的美国人，大肚子、头发灰白、体格健壮。他和戴维斯握了手，一下子坐到椅子上，喘着粗气。尽管他从自己的亚麻外套的口袋里迅速地掏出了满满一夹子弹，也没有放开紧握的柯尔特式44口径的自动手枪。他来的时候没有戴帽子，气喘吁吁，血从他脸颊上的石头划痕中渗出来，沿着他的脸流下。同样地，他也在一阵狂怒中一跃而起，一边换上子弹，一边爆发出激烈的咒骂。</td>
		<td class="en">Wemple went down, returning in several minutes with a tidily-paunched, well-built, gray-haired American of fifty.He shook hands with Davies and flung himself into a chair, breathing heavily.He did not relinquish his clutch on the Colt’s 44 automatic pistol, although he immediately addressed himself to the task of fishing a filled clip of cartridges from the pocket of his linen coat.He had arrived hatless and breathless, and the blood from a stone-cut on the cheek oozed down his face.He, too, in a fit of anger, springing to his feet when he had changed clips in his pistol, burst out with mouth-filling profanity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们把美国国旗丢进了垃圾堆里，踩它，还往上面吐唾沫。他们还让我也往上面吐唾沫。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They had an American flag in the dirt, stamping and spitting on it.And they told me to spit on it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外姆普和戴维斯用沉默的怀疑回应他。</td>
		<td class="en">Wemple and Davies regarded him with silent interrogation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我知道你们在想什么！”他突然发起怒来，“我会往上面吐哪怕一小口唾沫吗？这就是你们为什么烦扰。我来回答。坦白地说吧，事实上，我会的。我会把国旗放进你们的烟斗里，然后把它当烟抽。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I know what you’re wondering!” he flared out.“Would I a-spit on it in the pinch?That’s what’s eating you.I’ll answer.Straight out, brass tacks, I WOULD.Put that in your pipe and smoke it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他停了下来，自己从桌子上的盒子里拿出一支烟，镇定而轻蔑地点着。</td>
		<td class="en">He paused to help himself to a cigar from the box on the table and to light it with a steady and defiant hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“该死的！——我猜附近一带都知道安东尼·哈伯特，你们可以放心，没人说他是懦夫。当然，必要时，我会往国旗上吐唾沫。那你们觉得，我在这样的夜里到街上是干什么去？难道我没有在半小时之前溜出南部宾馆？这个宾馆里有40个有钱的全副武装的美国人，如果不算上他们的女人的话。那才叫安全。你们认为我来这里干什么？——来救你们？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hell!—I guess this neck of the woods knows Anthony Habert, and you can bank on it that it’s never located his yellow streak.Sure, in the pinch, I’d spit on Old Glory.What the hell d’ye think I’m going on the streets for a night like this?Didn’t I skin out of the Southern Hotel half an hour ago, where there are forty buck Americans, not counting their women, and all armed?That was safety.What d’ye think I came here for?—to rescue you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的愤怒堵住了喉咙，他不说话了，像中风一样发着抖。</td>
		<td class="en">His indignation lumped his throat into silence, and he seemed shaken as with an apoplexy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有话直说。”戴维斯冷冷地命令道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Spit it out,” Davies commanded dryly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我会告诉你们的,”哈伯特爆发了，“是比利·博伊。我和他之间隔着50英里，还有两万个互相要置对方于死地的联邦军和反叛者。如果他在这里，在坦皮科，而我在离帕努科50英里远的地方，你们知道那男孩会做什么吗？哦，我知道。而我就要去做一样的事——抓住他。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll tell you,’ Habert exploded.“It’s Billy Boy.Fifty miles up country and twenty-thousand throat-cutting federals and rebels between him and me.D’ye know what that boy’d do, if he was here in Tampico and I was fifty miles up the Panuco?Well, I know.And I’m going to do the same—go and get him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们正计划着去上游呢。”外姆普向他保证道。</td>
		<td class="en">“We’re figuring on going up,” Wemple assured him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这正是我来这里的原因了——当然是德雷克赛尔小姐了？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And that’s why I headed here—Miss Drexel, of course?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两人默认了，露出了微笑。在这种时候，男人们敢于说一些平时不说的话。</td>
		<td class="en">Both men acquiesced and smiled.It was a time when men dared speak of matters which at other times tabooed speech.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么首先我们要做的是，”哈伯特说着，看了看他的手表，“现在是午夜了。我们得去河边弄艘船来——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then the thing’s to get started,” Habert exclaimed, looking at his watch. “It’s midnight now.We’ve got to get to the river and get a boat—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，归来的暴民的叫嚷声从窗外传了进来，作为回应。</td>
		<td class="en">But the clamor of the returning mob came through the windows in answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戴维斯正要说话，这时电话响了起来，外姆普向电话冲了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">Davies was about to speak, when the telephone rang, and Wemple sprang to the instrument.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是卡森，”他一边听着，一边插话道，“他们还没砍断穿越河道的电线——你好，卡森。它是被弄破了还是被砍断了？……干得好……对，把骡子运到塔莫克勤那边的牧场上……谁在水站那儿？……你还能和他通上电话吗？……告诉他要让贮水池保持满满的，切断通往艾瑞口的总管道。另外，要坚持到最后一分钟，留一匹备好鞍的马，切断之后就逃命。在他逃走之前要做的最后一件事，就是他必须拔掉电话……对，对，对。当然。不要混血儿。让纯印第安血统的人负责。加夫列尔是个好家伙。天知道一旦我们被驱逐，我们什么时候能回来……2500个枪管可不能使哈拉米略降服。我们已经做好了10天的储备。加夫列尔将会处理这件事。让它继续移动，如果我们不得不把它开到河里去的话——”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s Carson,” he interjected, as he listened. “They haven’t cut the wires across the river yet—Hello, Carson.Was it a break or a cut?...Bully for you...Yes, move the mules across to the potrero beyond Tamcochin...Who’s at the water station?...Can you still phone him?...Tell him to keep the tanks full, and to shut off the main to Arico.Also, to hang on till the last minute, and keep a horse saddled to cut and run for it.Last thing before he runs, he must jerk out the phone...Yes, yes, yes.Sure.No breeds.Leave full-blooded Indians in charge.Gabriel is a good hombre.Heaven knows, once we’re chased out, when we’ll get back...You can’t pinch down Jaramillo under twenty-five hundred barrels.We’ve got storage for ten days.Gabriel’ll have to handle it.Keep it moving, if we have to run it into the river—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“问问他有没有汽艇。”哈伯特插话道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ask him if he has a launch,” Habert broke in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他没有，”外姆普回答道，“联邦军中午征用了最后一艘汽艇。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He hasn’t,” was Wemple’s answer. “The federals commandeered the last one at noon.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“说说看，卡森，你准备怎么逃跑？”外姆普问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Say, Carson, how are you going to make your get-away?” Wemple queried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >和他讲话的那个人正在帕努科对面正南方的油库里。</td>
		<td class="en">The man to whom he talked was across the Panuco, on the south side, at the tank farm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他说没有办法逃跑，”外姆普向另外两个人说道，“联邦军遍及工厂各处，他不明白为什么他们不在几小时前袭击他。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Says there isn’t any get-away,” Wemple vouchsafed to the other two. “The federals are all over the shop, and he can’t understand why they haven’t raided him hours ago.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“……谁？坎波斯？那个卑鄙的家伙！……好吧……要是没有我的消息不要担心。我会和戴维斯、哈伯特一块去河边……你自己拿主意，要是你找到一个可靠的机会，毙了坎波斯……哦，这边日子难着呢。他们正撞我们的门呢。对，尽一切办法……再见，老兄。”</td>
		<td class="en">“...Who?Campos?That skunk!...all right...Don’t be worried if you don’t hear from me.I’m going up river with Davies and Habert...Use your judgment, and if you get a safe chance at Campos, pot him...Oh, a hot time over here.They’re battering our doors now.Yes, by all means...Good-by, old man.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外姆普点燃了一根烟，擦拭着额头。</td>
		<td class="en">Wemple lighted a cigarette and wiped his forehead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们知道坎波斯，乔斯·H. 坎波斯吧，”他主动说起来，“这个肮脏的杂种已经为了两万比索支持卡森了。我们不得不付钱，否则他就会强迫我们一半的劳工入伍，或是把油井给点了。还有戴维斯，你知道，我们在过去这些年为他做了多少事。感恩？简单的礼貌？好家伙！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You know Campos, Jose H. Campos,” he volunteered. “The dirty cur’s stuck Carson up for twenty thousand pesos.We had to pay, or he’d have compelled half our peons to enlist or set the wells on fire.And you know, Davies, what we’ve done for him in past years.Gratitude?Simple decency?Great Scott!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那是4月21日的晚上。在4月21日的早上，美国的海军陆战队和水兵已经在维拉克鲁斯登陆，并且占领了海关大楼和整个城市。这个消息立即被拍成电报传了出去，复仇心重的墨西哥暴民占领了坦皮科的街道，并用撕毁美国国旗、咒骂美国人的方式来表达对美国政府行动的不满。</td>
		<td class="en">It was the night of April twenty-first.On the morning of the twenty-first the American marines and bluejackets had landed at Vera Cruz and seized the custom house and the city.Immediately the news was telegraphed, the vengeful Mexican mob had taken possession of the streets of Tampico and expressed its disapproval of the action of the United States by tearing down American flags and crying death to the Americans.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除非他们自己懒惰懦弱，否则没有什么可以阻止这些暴民把他们的威胁化为现实。如果他们真的砸毁了南部宾馆，或其他的宾馆，或是像外姆普的住宅这种地方的大门，一场战争就将开始，数以千计在坦皮科的联邦军战士将会和他们的平民同胞一起，履行减少墨西哥这一地区的外国佬人数的光荣任务。本应有美国战船起到震慑作用的，但是由于某些令人费解的过分谨慎，或者出于战略安排，或是老天知道的什么原因，美国政府在下令占领维拉克鲁斯时，就已经十分小心地将它的战船从坦皮科撤到了十二英里外空旷的墨西哥湾。这一命令通过无线电从华盛顿传到了舰队司令马约那里，他三次要求重复命令，之后他眼含着泪水抛弃了他的国民，驶向大海。</td>
		<td class="en">There was nothing save its own spinelessness to deter the mob from carrying out its threat.Had it battered down the doors of the Southern Hotel, or of other hotels, or of residences such as Wemple’s, a fight would have started in which the thousands of federal soldiers in Tampico would have joined their civilian compatriots in the laudable task of decreasing the Gringo population of that particular portion of Mexico.There should have been American warships to act as deterrents; but through some inexplicable excess of delicacy, or strategy, or heaven knows what, the United States, when it gave its orders to take Vera Cruz, had very carefully withdrawn its warships from Tampico to the open Gulf a dozen miles away.This order had come to Admiral Mayo by wireless from Washington, and thrice he had demanded the order to be repeated, ere, with tears in his eyes, he had turned his back on his countrymen and countrywomen and steamed to sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这些蠢驴，就这样把我们扔下不管！”哈伯特谴责着他的国家的当权者们，“马约决不会那样做的。听我说，他不得不听从华盛顿那边的命令。现在我们在这里，我们的亲友却散落在50英里之外……这么说吧，要是我没找到比利·博伊，我就永远不敢回家面对我的妻子了——来吧。我们三个动身吧。我们能够让街上的任何一帮歹徒胆战心惊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Of all asinine things, to leave us in the lurch this way!” Habert was denouncing the powers that be of his country.“Mayo’d never have done it.Mark my words, he had to take program from Washington.And here we are, and our dear ones scattered for fifty miles back up country...Say, if I lose Billy Boy I’ll never dare go home to face the wife—Come on.Let the three of us make a start.We can throw the fear of God into any gang on the streets.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“过来看一下。”戴维斯在他站着的地方说道，他稍稍从窗前退后，俯视着大街。</td>
		<td class="en">“Come on over and take a squint,” Davies invited from where he stood, somewhat back from the window, looking down into the street.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >街上挤满了暴民，都在大声地地训斥着、咒骂着、抱怨着，催促彼此把门打破，但是每个人都畏缩不前，因为他知道，在门后，等待着第一个冲上去的人的是死亡。</td>
		<td class="en">It was gorged with rioters, all haranguing, cursing, crying out death, and urging one another to smash the doors, but each hanging back from the death he knew waited behind those doors for the first of the rush.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们不能从那样一群人中冲出去，哈伯特。”戴维斯发表了意见。</td>
		<td class="en">“We can’t break through a bunch like that, Habert,” was Davies’ comment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要是我们死在他们脚下，我们就对比利·博伊或者在帕努科的任何人没什么用了。”外姆普补充道，“要是——”</td>
		<td class="en">“And if we die under their feet we’ll be of little use to Billy Boy or anybody else up the Panuco,” Wemple added. “And if—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >暴民的新举动让他打住不说了。一队白衣人缓慢而寂静地前进着，人们给他们让出一条道来。</td>
		<td class="en">A new movement of the mob caused him to break off.It was splitting before a slow and silent advance of a file of white-clad men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“水兵——马约终于还是回来救我们了。”哈伯特咕哝道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Bluejackets—Mayo’s come back for us after all,” Habert muttered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么我们可以得到一艘海军汽艇了。”戴维斯说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Then we can get a navy launch,” Davies said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >暴民的骚乱渐渐平静了，在寂静中，水兵们来到街门前，敲门想要进来。三个人都下去开门，却发现敲门的不是美国人，而是两个德国中尉和六个德国海军陆战队士兵。看到了美国人，暴民的怒气再次高涨起来，海军陆战队士兵用来福枪的枪柄敲击地面，平息了他们的骚动。</td>
		<td class="en">The bedlam of the mob died away, and, in silence, the sailors reached the street door and knocked for admittance.All three went down to open it, and to discover that the callers were not Americans but two German lieutenants and half a dozen German marines.At sight of the Americans, the rage of the mob rose again, and was quelled by the grounding of the rifle butts of the marines.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，谢谢。”那位年长的中尉用尚可听懂的英语说道，拒绝了进入房间的邀请。当暴民的叫嚷声淹没了他的声音时，他漫不经心地让他的雪茄燃着。“我们是在回船上的路上。我们的指挥官已经与英国和荷兰的指挥官协商过了，但是他们拒绝与我们合作，所以我们的指挥官将全权负责。我们就在宾馆周围。他们将支撑到黎明，然后我们带他们离开。我们已经给了他们一些像这样的火箭弹——拿着它们。如果有人冲进你们的房子，你们要支撑住，从房顶发射一只火箭弹。我们能够在45分钟之内派大军赶到这里。我们所有的汽艇都已经准备好了，执行岸上任务的汽艇人员和海军陆战队士兵也已经在汽艇上了，看到第一个火箭弹，我们就出发。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, thank you;” the senior lieutenant, in passable English, declined the invitation to enter.He unconcernedly kept his cigar alive at such times that the mob drowned his voice.“We are on the way back to our ship.Our commander conferred with the English and Dutch commanders; but they declined to cooperate, so our commander has undertaken the entire responsibility.We have been the round of the hotels.They are to hold their own until daybreak, when we’ll take them off.We have given them rockets such as these—Take them.If your house is entered, hold your own and send up a rocket from the roof.We can be here in force, in forty-five minutes.Steam is up in all our launches, launch crews and marines for shore duty are in the launches, and at the first rocket we shall start.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“既然你们要到船上去，我们希望和你们一起走。”表达了应有的谢意之后，戴维斯这样说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Since you are going aboard now, we should like to go with you,” Davies said, after having rendered due thanks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个中尉的脸上露出了明显的惊奇和厌恶。</td>
		<td class="en">The surprise and distaste on both lieutenants’ faces was patent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，不，”戴维斯笑了起来，“我们并不是想要避难。我们的朋友在上游50英里远的地方，我们想去河边找他们。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, no,” Davies laughed. “We don’t want refuge.We have friends fifty miles up river, and we want to get to the river in order to go up after them.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个军官的脸上立刻露出了高兴的表情，他们看了看彼此，沉默地交换了意见。</td>
		<td class="en">The pleasure on the officers’ faces was immediate as they looked a silent conference at each other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“既然我们的指挥官已经在这样一个晚上承担了重大的责任，难道我们可以连这点小小的责任都不承担吗？”年长的军官说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Since our commander has undertaken grave responsibility on a night like this, may we do less than take minor responsibility?” queried the elder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻的军官衷心赞成这个说法。不一会儿，再次上楼下楼一番之后，三个美国人准备好了。他们装备着大量的弹药和枪，还用雪茄、香烟和火柴把口袋塞得鼓鼓囊囊的。外姆普在楼上向假想中被留下的居住者呼喊了几声，确定弹簧锁已经锁住，然后砰的一声关上了门。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有那么一瞬间，这辆伟大的汽车似乎就要翻进集水坑里去了，但是下一秒钟它跑了过去。车给了洞底重重一击，弹了起来，竖起来攀爬着陡峭的斜坡。德雷克赛尔小姐，被灵感或是绝望攫住了，快速地脱下了她的短灯芯绒旅行裙，沿着沙地奔跑，把裙子扔下去给正在慢慢打转的轮子创造一个立足点。她穿着剪裁得很修长的茧绸灯笼裤，显得很轻盈，还有些男孩气。汽车几乎要停下来，但并未完全停住，然后开始加速前进，其他人则跑到一边推车。终于，汽车驶上了坚硬的道路。</td>
		<td class="en">For an instant it seemed that the great car would turn over into the sump, but the next instant it was past.It struck the bottom of the hollow a mighty wallop, and bounced and upended to the steep pitch of the climb.Miss Drexel, seized by inspiration or desperation, with a quick movement stripped off her short, corduroy tramping-skirt, and, looking very lithe and boyish in slender-cut pongee bloomers, ran along the sand and dropped the skirt for a foothold for the slowly revolving wheels.Almost, but not quite, did the car stop, then, gathering way, with the others running alongside and shoving, it emerged on the hard road.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们忙着把礼服、外套和德雷克赛尔小姐的裙子扔到车底，并且让摩根女士上了车，这时戴维斯追上了他们。</td>
		<td class="en">While they tossed the robes and coats and Miss Drexel’s skirt into the bottom of the car and got Mrs. Morgan on board, Davies overtook them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“躲到车底，你们所有人！”他大喊道，一边踩下踏脚板，汽车冲了出去。散乱的枪声从后面传来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Down on the bottom!—all of you!” he shouted, as he gained the running board and the machine sprang away.A scattering of shots came from the rear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“以生存为职责的人！——弯下腰！”戴维斯朝着外姆普的耳朵大喊道，伴随着这声命令，同时在他的肩膀上狠狠拍了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">“Whose business is to live!—hunch down!”Davies yelled in Wemple’s ear, accompanying the instruction with an open-handed blow on the shoulder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你自己先活着吧，”外姆普嘟囔道，一边顺从地弯下腰。“把你的头也低下去。你正把自己给暴露了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Live yourself,” Wemple grumbled as he obediently hunched.“Get your head down.You’re exposing yourself.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >追击持续了不久，之后渐渐平息，在不时传来的几声遥远的枪响中停止了。</td>
		<td class="en">The pursuit lasted but a little while, and died away in an occasional distant shot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们已经撤退了，”戴维斯宣布道，“他们这些愚蠢的脑袋里从来就没想过能在阿利森山抓到我们。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They’ve quit,” Davies announced. “It never entered their stupid heads that they could have caught us on Aliso Hill.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是不可能做到的。”查利·德雷克赛尔以年轻人快速的判断力说道，这时汽车停了下来，他们观察着阿里森陡峭的上坡上呈锐角的转弯。下面是湍急的河流。</td>
		<td class="en">“It can’t be done,” was Charley Drexel’s quick judgment of youth, as the machine stopped and they surveyed the acute-angled turn on the stiff up-grade of Aliso.Beneath was the swift-running river.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“大家都出来！”，外姆普命令道，“大家都上去，要是你们不想汽车翻到你身上的话。在它需要时给它一些牵引力。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Get out everybody!” Wemple commanded. “Up-side, all of you, if you don’t want the car to  turn over on you.Spread traction wherever she needs it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让它疾速前进，或者疾速后退——总之它不能停下来，”戴维斯占了路的外缘的位置，沉静地说道，“只要汽车静止不动了，那轮胎下的泥土就会碎掉。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Shoot her ahead, or back—she can’t stop,” Davies said quietly, from the outer edge of the road, where he had taken position. “The earth’s crumbling away from under the tires every second she stands still.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从下面出来，不然车子会压到你们身上。”外姆普命令道，他走在前面几码远的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">“Get out from under, or she’ll be on top of you,” Wemple ordered, as he went ahead several yards.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，在汽车停了一分钟之后，干而轻的泥土再次在轮胎下渐渐破裂粉碎，沿着陡峭的斜坡滚落到水中，就像一场小型的雪崩。直到外姆普在这条窄路上后退了50码之后，他才发现了干硬的可以停车的地方。他走上前来，检查着两条之字形路构成的锐角。他跟戴维斯计划着接下来要做什么。</td>
		<td class="en">But again, after the car rested a minute, the light, dry earth began to crack and crumble away from under the tires, rolling in a miniature avalanche down the steep declivity into the water.And not until Wemple had backed fifty yards down the narrow road did he find solid resting for the car.He came ahead on foot and examined the acute angle formed by the two zig-zags.Together with Davies he planned what was to be done.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你过来的话就得不停地向前移动，”戴维斯建议道，“要是你停在一个地方超过几秒钟，那就意味着死亡，而且走路也不好走。”</td>
		<td class="en">“When you come you’ve got to come a-humping,” Davies advised. “If you stop anywhere for more than seconds, it’s good night, and the walking won’t be fine.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“车子充满了战斗力，它能做到的。看那里内壁上的坚硬岩层。它不可能到比这更好的地点了。要是我不能让它的后轮爬到半山腰，大约一秒钟之后我们就将开始步行了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“She’s full of fight, and she can do it.See that hard formation right there on the inside wall.It couldn’t have come at a better spot.If I don’t make her hind wheels climb half way up it, we’ll start walking about a second thereafter.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它是一辆性能良好的汽车，”戴维斯鼓励道，“我知道这种车。要是连它也不能做到的话，那么迄今为止造出来的任何车都不能做到。我说的对吧，贝思？”</td>
		<td class="en">“She’s a two-fisted piece of machinery,” Davies encouraged. “I know her kind.If she can’t do it, no machine can that was ever made.Am I right, Beth?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它是一个合格的、生机勃勃的女魔鬼，”德雷克赛尔小姐大笑着表示同意，“你们两个也是——呃——我指的是男魔鬼。”</td>
		<td class="en">“She’s a regular, spunky she-devil,” Miss Drexel laughed agreement. “And so are the pair of you—er—of the male persuasion, I mean.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于他们两人来说，德雷克赛尔小姐看起来从未像这时那样迷人。在兴奋之中，她完全没有注意到自己超短的服装、飘动着的棕色头发、发出光芒的眼睛和微笑着的嘴唇。两个男人发现对方在那一刻都停下来看着她，他们向对方叹了口气，坦然地看进对方的眼睛里，然后转向手头的工作。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Drexel had never seemed so fascinating to either of them as she was then, in the excitement quite unconscious of her abbreviated costume, her brown hair flying, her eyes sparkling, her lips smiling.Each man caught the other in that moment’s pause to look, and each man sighed to the other and looked frankly into each other’s eyes ere he turned to the work at hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外姆普又开始了他惯例的冲进，但这是一次经过校准的冲进；戴维斯占据了危险的位置，在外侧的踏脚板上，在那里他的体重能够帮助宽大的轮胎更深地咬进不牢靠的路面。要是路沿崩塌了，当汽车翻滚着落向河里时，他就肯定会被压在下面。</td>
		<td class="en">Wemple came up with his usual rush, but it was a gauged rush; and Davies took the post of danger, the outside running board, where his weight would help the broad tires to bite a little deeper into the treacherous surface.If the road-edge crumbled away it was inevitable that he would be caught under the car as it rolled over and down to the river.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们前进然后倒退，又前进，又倒退，只停顿很短的时间来换挡。外姆普后退到内岸上的坚硬岩层，直到汽车看起来像是竖起来了，然后他向前猛冲，直到外沿的泥土在前胎下碎裂开来，溅落进水里。戴维斯在需要时跳下或再次踩上踏脚板，在汽车不平稳的前行中伴随着它，把礼服和外套放在车胎下面，并命令德雷克赛尔在另一边同样这么做，同时警告德雷克赛尔小姐让开些。</td>
		<td class="en">It was ahead and reverse, ahead and reverse, with only the briefest of pauses in which to shift the gears.Wemple backed up the hard formation on the inside bank till the car seemed standing on end, rushed ahead till the earth of the outer edge broke under the front tires and splashed in the water.Davies, now off, and again on the running board when needed, accompanied the car in its jerky and erratic progress, tossing robes and coats under the tires, calling instructions to Drexel similarly occupied on the other side, and warning Miss Drexel out of the way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，你们这些可爱的老朋友，你们这些可爱的老朋友。”外姆普大声地念叨着，就像在祈祷一样，一边在这块狭窄的区域与汽车搏斗。他有时在移动汽车时前进几英里，有时又退回到内壁上先前走到的地点，还有一次，让车带着下面的路基表面，整个地侧向下滑了两英尺。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, you Merry Olds, you Merry Olds, you Merry Olds,” Wemple muttered aloud, as if in prayer, as he wrestled the car about the narrow area, gaining sometimes inches in pivoting it, sometimes fetching back up the inner wall precisely at the spot previously attained, and, once, having the car, with the surface of the roadbed under it, slide bodily and sidewise, two feet down the road.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >德雷克赛尔小姐的鼓掌是戴维斯收到的第一个信号，标志着这项壮举已经完成了。他跳上踏脚板，发现汽车正在笔直地走向下一个之字形路口，而外姆普仍然在狂喜地吟诵着：“哦，你们这些亲爱的老朋友，你们这些亲爱的老朋友！”</td>
		<td class="en">The clapping of Miss Drexel’s hands was the first warning Davies received that the feat was accomplished, and, swinging on to the running board, he found the car backing in the straight-away up the next zigzag and Wemple still chanting ecstatically, “Oh, you Merry Olds, you Merry Olds!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在通往坦皮科的路上再也没有陡坡和之字形路了，但是这条粗糙修建的道路太过狭窄，汽车还要后退两英里，才能找到可以转弯的地方。在到达坦皮科之前的确还有一件重要的事情——那就是立宪主义者的包围圈。但是在这里，中午的时候，命运之神以三个持机关枪的美国雇佣兵的形式伸出了援手。他们从德克萨斯州边境的前进开始，打完了和维拉的整场战争。举着一面白色的旗子，外姆普开车经过争论地带，驶入了联邦的国境线。在那里，命运之神又装成一个无所不在的德国海军军官，再次接待了他们。</td>
		<td class="en">There were no more grades nor zig-zags between them and Tampico, but, so narrow was the primitive road, two miles farther were backed before space was found in which to turn around.One thing of importance did lie between them and Tampico—namely the investing lines of the constitutionalists.But here, at noon, fortune favored in the form of three American soldiers of fortune, operators of machine guns, who had fought the entire campaign with Villa from the beginning of the advance from the Texan border.Under a white flag, Wemple drove the car across the zone of debate into the federal lines, where good fortune, in the guise of an ubiquitous German naval officer, again received them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想你们差不多是唯一留在坦皮科的美国人了，”他告诉他们，“其余的人大都在海湾上的不同军舰里露宿呢。但是在南部宾馆还有一些美国人，而且形势也比较平静了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think you are nearly the only Americans left in Tampico,” he told them. “About all the rest are lying out in the Gulf on the different warships.But at the Southern Hotel there are several, and the situation seems quieter.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他们在南部宾馆下车的时候，戴维斯把手放在车上，低语道：“好老妹！”外姆普照着他的样子做了。德雷克赛尔小姐看着两个男人的眼睛，想说些什么，但是眼中突然蒙上了一层水雾。她歉疚地转向汽车，抚摸车身，同样重复着说：“好老妹！”</td>
		<td class="en">As they got out at the Southern, Davies laid his hand on the car and murmured, “Good old girl!”Wemple followed suit.And Miss Drexel, engaging both men’s eyes and about to say something, was guilty of a sudden moisture in her own eyes that made her turn to the car with a caressing hand and repeat, “Good old girl!”</td></tr>
