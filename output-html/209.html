		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，”他略带悲伤地对我点头说道，“希维拉尼晚年又回到老样子了，也恢复了她那些古老的信仰——当然，这一切都是在秘而不宣地进行的。而且，请相信我，她本人还收藏过某些东西呢。你应该看到过她收藏的骨骸吧。她把那些骨骸保存在一些大罐子里，存放在她卧室中的某些地方。除了五六块骨骸被卡纳尤抢先赶到夺走外，她收集到的骨骸几乎包括她所有亲戚的了。这两个人过去还常常为这些骨骸争吵不休，那架势真令人生畏呀。小时候，我曾进到她那宽大昏暗的房间里。在那里，我了解到，这个罐子里装的都是我外姑婆的骨骸，那个罐子里装的都是我曾祖父的骨骸，所有的罐子里都保存着祖先的骨骸，他们的躯体早已化作了灰暗的粉末。一想起这些，我就感到毛骨悚然。祖先的血脉传递下来，并注入到现世的人身上，这最终也给予了我生命。最后，希维拉尼几乎完全接受了土著人的习俗，睡在硬地板上铺就的草席上——那张庞大豪华、装有帐帘的卧床也被她清出了房间，那张卧床曾是拜伦男爵送给她祖母的。1825年，拜伦男爵，也就是唐·胡安·拜伦的堂兄弟，曾乘坐“布朗迪”号三帆快速战舰来过这里。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” he nodded half-sadly to me, “in her last years Hiwilani went back to the old ways, and to the old beliefs—in secret, of course.And, believe me, she was some collector herself.You should have seen her bones.She had them all about her bedroom, in big jars, and they constituted most all her relatives, except a half-dozen or so that Kanau beat her out of by getting to them first.The way the pair of them used to quarrel about those bones was awe-inspiring.And it gave me the creeps, when I was a boy, to go into that big, for-ever-twilight room of hers, and know that in this jar was all that remained of my maternal grand-aunt, and that in that jar was my great-grandfather, and that in all the jars were the preserved bone-remnants of the shadowy dust of the ancestors whose seed had come down and been incorporated in the living, breathing me.Hiwilani had gone quite native at the last, sleeping on mats on the hard floor—she’d fired out of the room the great, royal, canopied four-poster that had been presented to her grandmother by Lord Byron, who was the cousin of the Don Juan Byron and came here in the frigate Blonde in 1825.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But he broke off abruptly, and by the sensitive dilation of his nostrils and by the expression of his mobile features I saw that he had read in the air and identified the odour that offended him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Deuce take it!” he cried to me.“It stinks to heaven.And I shall be doomed to wear it until we’re rescued.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >毫无疑问，他对这种气味是极为讨厌的。那个年迈干瘦的妇女，正在用哈拉树的果实做最惹人喜爱的花环（夏威夷人饰戴的花环），哈拉树就是生长在南太平洋地区的露兜树。她正把水果的许多瓣或坚果壳层切挖成有凹槽的铃铛形状，准备把它们串在用豪树坚韧的内皮绞搓成的细绳上。那气味的确很浓烈。不过，对于我这个新来夏威夷的人来说，那气味却是葡萄酒瓶塞和水果汁液之类的气味，并不怎么令人讨厌。</td>
		<td class="en">There was no mistaking the object of his abhorrence.The ancient crone was making a dearest-loved lei (wreath) of the fruit of the hala which is the screw-pine or pandanus of the South Pacific.She was cutting the many sections or nut-envelopes of the fruit into fluted bell-shapes preparatory to stringing them on the twisted and tough inner bark of the hau tree.It certainly smelled to heaven, but, to me, a malahini, the smell was wine-woody and fruit-juicy and not unpleasant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿库利王子的豪华轿车刚开出了有四分之一英里的路程，轿车的某个车轴就断裂了。于是，他和我只好在一个真正的遮阴棚下躲避太阳的暴晒。这个遮阴棚是属于一户山里人家的。这个棚子是用茅草盖的，很简陋。不过，它矗立在一个秋海棠珍宝园中。秋海棠在我们头顶20英尺的地方绽放着它们精美的花朵，这些秋海棠长得就像是树木一样，柔软的树干像男人的臂膀那样粗壮。在这里，我们吸着椰子汁，以消除疲劳和恢复精力。与此同时，一个牛仔骑车到二十多英里外最近的电话亭打电话，好从城镇上叫来一辆机动车辆。当我们的目光越过数英里的甘蔗田，越过汹涌的海浪围绕的礁脉线，越过海面上蓝色薄雾，我们就能够看得到那个城镇。那就是位于奥洛科纳的拉卡奈伊大都市，也就是海滨线上那一片烟雾笼罩的地方。从远处看去，海面上的瓦胡岛就像是一颗暗淡的猫眼石，在那里闪着微光。</td>
		<td class="en">Prince Akuli’s limousine had broken an axle a quarter of a mile away, and he and I had sought shelter from the sun in this veritable bowery of a mountain home.Humble and grass-thatched was the house, but it stood in a treasure-garden of begonias that sprayed their delicate blooms a score of feet above our heads, that were like trees, with willowy trunks of trees as thick as a man’s arm.Here we refreshed ourselves with drinking-coconuts, while a cowboy rode a dozen miles to the nearest telephone and summoned a machine from town.The town itself we could see, the Lakanaii metropolis of Olokona, a smudge of smoke on the shore-line, as we looked down across the miles of cane-fields, the billow-wreathed reef-lines, and the blue haze of ocean to where the island of Oahu shimmered like a dim opal on the horizon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >毛伊岛是夏威夷的谷岛，而考爱岛是夏威夷的花园岛。但是与瓦胡岛并驾齐驱的拉卡奈伊岛，从前就一直为世人所知。目前，它被世人认可为夏威夷诸岛中的宝石岛。拉卡奈伊岛不是夏威夷群岛中最大的岛，也不是最小的岛，但所有夏威夷人都认为它是最为原始、最富有狂野之美的岛。而且，就面积大小而论，它是所有这些群岛中最为富庶的岛屿了。它每英亩田地产出的蔗糖最多，山上放养的菜牛最为肥壮，雨量也最为充沛，且又不会带来什么灾难。与毛伊岛的相似在于，它也是最早形成的，因此，它也是最为古老的岛屿。这样，它就有足够的时间让火山岩分解为最肥沃的土壤，也有足够的时间让古老火山口之间的峡谷腐蚀消磨，直到它们就像科罗拉多州大峡谷一样：无数条瀑布从数千英尺的高度垂直奔流而下，或飞散为层层面纱般的水雾，消散在半空中，然后又轻柔无息地下飘穿过海市蜃楼般的彩虹，最终它们就像无数的小露珠或是轻柔的细雨，降落在下面的深渊之上。</td>
		<td class="en">Maui is the Valley Isle of Hawaii, and Kauai the Garden Isle; but Lakanaii, lying abreast of Oahu, is recognized in the present, and was known of old and always, as the Jewel Isle of the group.Not the largest, nor merely the smallest, Lakanaii is conceded by all to be the wildest, the most wildly beautiful, and, in its size, the richest of all the islands.Its sugar tonnage per acre is the highest, its mountain beef-cattle the fattest, its rainfall the most generous without ever being disastrous.It resembles Kauai in that it is the first-formed and therefore the oldest island, so that it had had time sufficient to break down its lava rock into the richest soil, and to erode the canyons between the ancient craters until they are like Grand Canyons of the Colorado, with numberless waterfalls plunging thousands of feet in the sheer or dissipating into veils of vapour, and evanescing in mid-air to descend softly and invisibly through a mirage of rainbows, like so much dew or gentle shower, upon the abyss-floors.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，拉卡奈伊岛还是容易描述的。但是，人们又该如何描述阿库利王子呢？想要了解他，就要对卡拉奈伊岛的一切有个最为透彻的了解。此外，人们还必须对这个世界之外的很多情况十分了解才行。首先，阿库利王子既没有被认可也没有合法权利被称为“王子”。而且，“阿库利”本身就是“鱿鱼”的意思。因此，鱿鱼王子几乎不可能是夏威夷最古老、最高贵的酋长（夏威夷部族的高级首领）的直系后裔的高贵头衔——那是一个古老的、独一无二的血统。在这个血统中，婚姻是按照埃及法老古老的方式行事的，兄妹之间甚至也会举行皇室婚礼。这是因为，他们不能与比他们地位低的人结婚；还因为，在他们所有已知的世界里，没有谁比他们地位更高贵了；原因还在于，他们的王朝必须要永存下去，因此无论付出什么样的代价也都在所不惜了。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet Lakanaii is easy to describe.But how can one describe Prince Akuli?To know him is to know all Lakanaii most thoroughly.In addition, one must know thoroughly a great deal of the rest of the world.In the first place, Prince Akuli has no recognized nor legal right to be called “Prince.”Furthermore, “Akuli” means the “squid.”So that Prince Squid could scarcely be the dignified title of the straight descendant of the oldest and highest aliis (high chiefs) of Hawaii—an old and exclusive stock, wherein, in the ancient way of the Egyptian Pharaohs, brothers and sisters had even wed on the throne for the reason that they could not marry beneath rank, that in all their known world there was none of higher rank, and that, at every hazard, the dynasty must be perpetuated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我曾听过阿库利王子的咏唱历史学家（从其父那里继承而来）歌颂阿库利王子家族冗长的宗谱。通过这种方式，这些历史学家们证明阿库利王子是整个夏威夷版图内至高无上的酋长。宗谱是以韦克雅和帕帕开始的，韦克雅是他们宗族的亚当，而帕帕则是他们宗族的夏娃。之后经过许多代，那代数就如同我们字母表中字母那样多，从那么多代的人中追查下来，一直到他们第一个在夏威夷出生的祖先，纳纳卡奥科，他的妻子是卡希希奥卡拉尼。之后，他们的后代同尤亚的后代分裂开来，但他们的后代一直是地位最高的宗族，尤亚曾经缔造了一个王族，这个王族后来分化成考爱岛和瓦胡岛这两个截然不同的王族。</td>
		<td class="en">I have heard Prince Akuli’s singing historians (inherited from his father) chanting their interminable genealogies, by which they demonstrated that he was the highest alii in all Hawaii.Beginning with Wakea, who is their Adam, and with Papa, their Eve, through as many generations as there are letters in our alphabet they trace down to Nanakaoko, the first ancestor born in Hawaii and whose wife was Kahihiokalani.Later, but always highest, their generations split from the generations of Ua, who was the founder of the two distinct lines of the Kauai and Oahu kings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >根据记述拉卡奈伊岛历史的历史学家的说法，公元十一世纪时，拉卡奈伊岛王室家族的兄妹之间进行了婚配。因为在当时，没有哪一个人的地位超过他们，于是，他们的地位获得了近乎最高新血统的推进。一个名叫霍伊凯莫亚的人，凭借着不同星座的方位和古老的惯例，从萨摩亚驾驶着一只巨大的双船独木舟到达了这里。他娶了拉卡奈伊王室家族中较小的公主。当他的三个孩子长大后，他就和他们一起回了萨摩亚，想把他自己最小的兄弟也带过来。然而，同他一起回来的是库米，也就是图伊·马努亚的儿子。图伊·马努亚的地位在所有玻利尼西亚地区是最高的，仅仅次于受崇拜的人和众神的地位。因此，八个世纪之前，库米可敬的血脉，就已经注入了拉卡奈伊王室的血脉之中，并借此传递了下来，根本没有偏离自己的家族。最终，他的血脉延续到了阿库利王子身上。</td>
		<td class="en">In the eleventh century A.D., by the Lakanaii historians, at the time brothers and sisters mated because none existed to excel them, their rank received a boost of new blood of rank that was next to heaven’s door.One Hoikemaha, steering by the stars and the ancient traditions, arrived in a great double-canoe from Samoa.He married a lesser alii of Lakanaii, and when his three sons were grown, returned with them to Samoa to bring back his own youngest brother.But with him he brought back Kumi, the son of Tui Manua, which latter’s rank was highest in all Polynesia, and barely second to that of the demigods and gods.So the estimable seed of Kumi, eight centuries before, had entered into the aliis of Lakanaii, and been passed down by them in the undeviating line to reposit in Prince Akuli.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我初次见到他，是在南非布莱克沃奇的军官食堂里。他当时操着牛津口音，在那里谈论着什么。那恰巧发生在那个著名的军团在马赫斯方丹被分隔消灭之前。正如他有权利带着牛津口音说话一样，他也同样有足够的权利去那个食堂就餐。因为他当时在牛津接受教育，并且他还持有英国女皇的委任状。和他呆在一起正在观看战争的，是他的客人丘比特王子，虽然他的绰号是丘比特王子，可他却是包括拉卡奈伊在内的整个夏威夷版图的真正王子。他真正的、合法的称谓是乔纳·库希奥·卡拉尼亚内奥尔王子。要不是发生了夏威夷白人革命和吞并活动，他当时就有可能成为整个夏威夷乃伊王的重生转世——尽管存在这样一个事实，即丘比特王子的王族家系比不上阿库利王子上帝推助的家系。要不是阿库利王子的祖父被第一批、同时也是最为强大的卡迈哈迈哈人彻底击败，阿库利王子当时就可能成为卡拉奈伊及整个夏威夷版图的最高领袖。</td>
		<td class="en">Him I first met, talking with an Oxford accent, in the officers’ mess of the Black Watch in South Africa.This was just before that famous regiment was cut to pieces at Magersfontein.He had as much right to be in that mess as he had to his accent, for he was Oxford-educated and held the Queen’s Commission.With him, as his guest, taking a look at the war, was Prince Cupid, so nicknamed, but the true prince of all Hawaii, including Lakanaii, whose real and legal title was Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, and who might have been the living King of Hawaii Nei had it not been for the haole (white man) Revolution and Annexation—this, despite the fact that Prince Cupid’s alii genealogy was lesser to the heaven-boosted genealogy of Prince Akuli.For Prince Akuli might have been King of Lakanaii, and of all Hawaii, perhaps, had not his grandfather been soundly thrashed by the first and greatest of the Kamehamehas.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这件事发生在檀香木贸易繁荣的1810年。那一年，考爱岛的国王来了，他非常忠厚，并且盲目相信卡迈哈迈哈人。那一年，阿库利王子的祖父因为是“守旧派”，受到了考爱岛国王的痛击和压制。依靠枪弹和夏威夷白人炮手为实力来建立起一个岛屿帝国，这是他未曾想到的。卡迈哈迈哈更有远见，他吸纳了夏威夷白人的军事力量，包括诸如艾萨克·戴维斯和约翰·扬在内的这类人。艾萨克·戴维斯是“公平美洲人”号纵帆船全体船员大屠杀中的大副和唯一的幸存者，约翰·扬是“埃利诺”号敞舱平底大驳船上被俘的水手长。艾萨克·戴维斯、约翰·扬以及他们刚愎冒险的家族的其他成员，带着从俘获的“伊菲格涅亚”号和“公平美洲人”号船上获得的六磅重的铜质近距舰炮，摧毁了卡拉奈伊岛国王的战船，并极大削弱了其登陆士兵的士气。因此，他们从卡迈哈迈哈那里获得了应有的回报。根据协议，艾萨克·戴维斯获得了六百头出圈的肥猪，而约翰·扬则获得了五百头相同规格的、现场屠宰的猪。</td>
		<td class="en">This had occurred in the year 1810, in the booming days of the sandalwood trade, and in the same year that the King of Kauai came in, and was good, and ate out of Kamehameha’s hand.Prince Akuli’s grandfather, in that year, had received his trouncing and subjugating because he was “old school.”He had not imaged island empire in terms of gunpowder and haole gunners.Kamehameha, farther-visioned, had annexed the service of haoles, including such men as Isaac Davis, mate and sole survivor of the massacred crew of the schooner Fair American, and John Young, captured boatswain of the scow Eleanor.And Isaac Davis, and John Young, and others of their waywardly adventurous ilk, with six-pounder brass carronades from the captured Iphigenia and Fair American, had destroyed the war canoes and shattered the morale of the King of Lakanaii’s land-fighters, receiving duly in return from Kamehameha, according to agreement: Isaac Davis, six hundred mature and fat hogs; John Young, five hundred of the same described pork on the hoof that was split.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，由于所有的近亲通婚和原始文化的贪欲，由于野蛮人对地位名望的探求，由于各种血腥的谋杀、残忍的争斗以及与半神地位弟弟的婚配，在二十世纪的当口，阿库利王子，即鱿鱼王子出现在了这里。他历世精练，带着牛津口音，从他那辆出故障的、价值七千美元的大轿车中出来了。他是名副其实的波利尼西亚人，一座跨越数千世纪的活生生的桥梁。他既是我的同志、朋友，又是我的旅行伙伴。他和我一起被搁浅在这海拔一千四百英尺的秋海棠乐园之中。他告诉了我他那位于奥洛科纳的岛屿大都市，还告诉了我关于他母亲的一些事情。他母亲晚年恢复了古老的宗教观念以及祖先崇拜。她收集了过去黑暗岁月中她祖先遗留下来的恐怖的骨骸，并把它们放在自己的身旁。</td>
		<td class="en">And so, out of all incests and lusts of the primitive cultures and beast-man’s gropings toward the stature of manhood, out of all red murders, and brute battlings, and matings with the younger brothers of the demigods, world-polished, Oxford-accented, twentieth century to the tick of the second, comes Prince Akuli, Prince Squid, pure-veined Polynesian, a living bridge across the thousand centuries, comrade, friend, and fellow-traveller out of his wrecked seven-thousand-dollar limousine, marooned with me in a begonia paradise fourteen hundred feet above the sea, and his island metropolis of Olokona, to tell me of his mother, who reverted in her old age to ancientness of religious concept and ancestor worship, and collected and surrounded herself with the charnel bones of those who had been her forerunners back in the darkness of time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“卡拉考亚国王最先开始从事收集骨骸这一狂热的时尚，接着是奥休，”阿库利子继续说道,“他的王后卡皮奥拉尼也从他那里感染了这种狂热。他们收集任何东西——古老的马克洛席垫、古老的塔帕纤维布、古老的葫芦、古老的一体双木舟，以及那些牧师们在1819年遍及各地的大破坏中保存下来的各种圣像。多年以来，我都未曾见过珍珠贝制成的鱼钩，但是我确信卡拉考亚积攒有上万只这样的鱼钩，更不用说由人的颌骨制成的鱼钩、由羽毛制成的披风、各式的披肩、各式的帽盔、石制扁斧以及阴茎式样的夏威夷芋泥饼捣杵了。当他和卡皮奥拉尼绕着这些岛屿进行盛大的巡视时，接待他们的那些主人都不得不把他们私人的遗物藏起来。因为从理论上来说，他子民的一切财产都是属于他这个国王的。对于卡拉考亚而言，当涉及到古老东西的时候，该理论与实践也就统一到一起了。</td>
		<td class="en">“King Kalakaua started this collecting fad, over on Oahu,” Prince Akuli continued.“And his queen, Kapiolani, caught the fad from him.They collected everything—old makaloa mats, old tapas, old calabashes, old double-canoes, and idols which the priests had saved from the general destruction in 1819.I haven’t seen a pearl-shell fish-hook in years, but I swear that Kalakaua accumulated ten thousand of them, to say nothing of human jaw-bone fish-hooks, and feather cloaks, and capes and helmets, and stone adzes, and poi-pounders of phallic design.When he and Kapiolani made their royal progresses around the islands, their hosts had to hide away their personal relics.For to the king, in theory, belongs all property of his people; and with Kalakaua, when it came to the old things, theory and practice were one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从他那里，我父亲卡纳尤内心也产生了收集骨骸的念头。同样，希维拉尼也受到了感染。不过，父亲的思想却紧跟着时代的潮流。他既不相信僧侣们所信仰的众神，也不相信传教士们信仰的神灵。他认同买卖蔗糖股票，也相信饲养马匹可以赚钱,他还认为他父亲当年就是一个傻瓜，因为他父亲在出征同卡迈哈迈哈作战时没有吸纳艾萨克·戴维斯、约翰·扬那一小撮人，也没有使用黄铜舰炮。除了这些之外，他不相信任何别的事物。因此，他收集古董完全是出于收集者的爱好，但我母亲却把这件事看得很严肃。这就是她热衷于收集骨骸的原因。我还记得，她以前有一个古老的、难看的石制圣像，她过去常常对着它哭诉，并绕着它在地板上爬行。这个石制的圣像现在摆放在迪肯博物馆中。在她去世之后，我就把那个东西送到了那里，把她收集的骨骸送到了奥洛科纳的皇家陵墓大厦。</td>
		<td class="en">“From him my father, Kanau, got the collecting bee in his bonnet, and Hiwilani was likewise infected.But father was modern to his finger-tips.He believed neither in the gods of the kahunas (priests) nor of the missionaries.He didn’t believe in anything except sugar stocks, horse-breeding, and that his grandfather had been a fool in not collecting a few Isaac Davises and John Youngs and brass carronades before he went to war with Kamehameha.So he collected curios in the pure collector’s spirit; but my mother took it seriously.That was why she went in for bones.I remember, too, she had an ugly old stone-idol she used to yammer to and crawl around on the floor before.It’s in the Deacon Museum now.I sent it there after her death, and her collection of bones to the Royal Mausoleum in Olokona.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不知道你是否记得，她的父亲叫卡奥库尤。没错，他就叫卡奥库尤，他是个身材高大的人。当人们建造那个皇家陵墓大厦的时候，人们把他的尸骨从隐秘的埋葬地挖掘了出来，然后存放在那个皇家陵墓大厦中。当时，他的尸骨非常干净，并且保存得相当完好。希维拉尼身边有一个名叫阿休纳的老仆人。一天夜里，她从卡纳尤那里偷来了钥匙，派阿休纳去把她父亲的尸骨从陵墓大厦中偷了出来。这一点，我是知道的。他当年肯定是一个身材高大的人。她把他的骨骸存放在她的一个大罐子里。当我还是一个小家伙时，有一天，我心存好奇，想知道卡奥库尤是否如人们通常所说的那样高大,于是，我就把他完整的下颌骨连同包装材料用钩子从罐子中拉了出来，然后在自己身上试了试。我的头恰巧从那个下颌骨中穿过去，那下颌骨就像一个马颈轭一样套在我的脖子上，搁在我的肩头上。那下颌骨上的每一颗牙齿，比搪瓷还要洁白光亮，没有一个蛀洞，上面的牙釉洁白无瑕、完好无损。虽然她不得不喊来阿休纳，让他帮助把那下颌骨从我头上取下来。但是，由于那次不敬的行为，我也受到了有生以来的一顿痛打。不过，那次意外的事情也给我带来了很大的好处。我不惧怕死人的骨骸，这赢得了她对我的信心，也赢得了我在牛津大学的教育。如果派请的车辆来的不早的话，你就会了解到这一点的。</td>
