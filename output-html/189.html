		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终是赛拉斯·班纳曼制服了埃米尔·格卢克这个科学奇才，人类头号大敌。格卢克坐上电椅前的供词，解开了一系列神秘事件的疑团。这些事件发生在1933年到1941年间，看似毫不相关，却扰乱了世界。在这份引人关注的档案公布之前，所有人做梦也不会想到，葡萄牙国王与王后遇刺和纽约城的谋杀警官案有什么关联。虽然埃米尔·格卢克的所作所为令人憎恶，我们却忍不住多少为这么一个不幸的、被扭曲、被虐待的天才扼腕叹息。从来没有人讲过关于他的这些故事，根据他的招供和当时大量的证据、文档和记录，我们可以勾勒出一幅他的相当真实的画像，并清楚地看到是什么因素和压力将他变成这样一个人间怪物，并驱使他沿着走过的那条恐怖的路一直走下去，越陷越深。</td>
		<td class="en">It was Silas Bannerman who finally ran down that scientific wizard and arch-enemy of mankind, Emil Gluck.Gluck’s confession, before he went to the electric chair, threw much light upon the series of mysterious events, many apparently unrelated, that so perturbed the world between the years 1933 and 1941.It was not until that remarkable document was made public that the world dreamed of there being any connection between the assassination of the King and Queen of Portugal and the murders of the New York City police officers.While the deeds of Emil Gluck were all that was abominable, we cannot but feel, to a certain extent, pity for the unfortunate, malformed, and maltreated genius.This side of his story has never been told before, and from his confession and from the great mass of evidence and the documents and records of the time we are able to construct a fairly accurate portrait of him, and to discern the factors and pressures that moulded him into the human monster he became and that drove him onward and downward along the fearful path he trod.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1895年，埃米尔·格卢克在纽约城的锡拉丘兹出生。他的父亲约瑟夫斯·格卢克是个特警兼守夜人，1900年突然患肺炎去世了。他的母亲是个漂亮而脆弱的人，结婚前是做女帽的，因为失去丈夫而悲伤过度，也随他而去了。母亲的敏感遗传给了儿子，并在他身上演变成了病态和恐怖的状态。</td>
		<td class="en">Emil Gluck was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1895.His father, Josephus Gluck, was a special policeman and night watchman, who, in the year 1900, died suddenly of pneumonia.The mother, a pretty, fragile creature, who, before her marriage, had been a milliner, grieved herself to death over the loss of her husband.This sensitiveness of the mother was the heritage that in the boy became morbid and horrible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1901年，当时六岁的小男孩埃米尔搬去和他的姨妈安·巴特尔同住。她是他母亲的妹妹，但是她心里对这个敏感、畏缩的小男孩没什么好感。安·巴特尔是个虚荣肤浅、无情无义的女人。同时，她受贫困之苦，还被她那又懒又怪、一事无成的丈夫拖累。小埃米尔·格卢克不受欢迎，我们可以相信安·巴特尔能够让他充分认识到这一点。下面的例子可以说明他在早年成长时期曾遭受过什么。</td>
		<td class="en">In 1901, the boy, Emil, then six years of age, went to live with his aunt, Mrs. Ann Bartell.She was his mother’s sister, but in her breast was no kindly feeling for the sensitive, shrinking boy.Ann Bartell was a vain, shallow, and heartless woman.Also, she was cursed with poverty and burdened with a husband who was a lazy, erratic ne’er-do-well.Young Emil Gluck was not wanted, and Ann Bartell could be trusted to impress this fact sufficiently upon him.As an illustration of the treatment he received in that early, formative period, the following instance is given.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在巴特尔家住了一年多一点的时候,就摔断了腿。他到不允许去的屋顶上玩耍，因此受了伤——仿佛所有的小男孩都曾这样做过，也会永远继续下去。他的腿断了两处，在膝盖和大腿之间。在他那些受惊的玩伴的帮助下，埃米尔设法拖着身子到了屋前的人行道，在那里晕了过去。住在附近的孩子们害怕巴特尔家那个当家的、面目凶恶的悍妇，但是他们下定决心后，按了门铃，告诉安·巴特尔这个意外。她甚至连都没看那个躺在人行道上受了伤的孩子，而是砰地关上门回到洗衣盆那里。时间过去了。天上飘起了毛毛雨，埃米尔·格卢克从昏迷中醒了过来，躺在雨中啜泣。这时候应该立即固定断腿。事实上，炎症很快出现了，事情变得严重了。两个小时后，隔壁的女人愤怒了，向安·巴特尔抗议。这次她出来看了看小男孩。她还从侧面踢了这个躺在她脚下的无助的小男孩，歇斯底里地要与他断绝关系。她说他不是她的孩子，还建议叫救护车来把他带到收诊的医院。然后她又进了屋。</td>
		<td class="en">When he had been living in the Bartell home a little more than a year, he broke his leg.He sustained the injury through playing on the forbidden roof—as all boys have done and will continue to do to the end of time.The leg was broken in two places between the knee and thigh.Emil, helped by his frightened playmates, managed to drag himself to the front sidewalk, where he fainted.The children of the neighbourhood were afraid of the hard-featured shrew who presided over the Bartell house; but, summoning their resolution, they rang the bell and told Ann Bartell of the accident.She did not even look at the little lad who lay stricken on the sidewalk, but slammed the door and went back to her wash-tub.The time passed.A drizzle came on, and Emil Gluck, out of his faint, lay sobbing in the rain.The leg should have been set immediately.As it was, the inflammation rose rapidly and made a nasty case of it.At the end of two hours, the indignant women of the neighbourhood protested to Ann Bartell.This time she came out and looked at the lad.Also she kicked him in the side as he lay helpless at her feet, and she hysterically disowned him.He was not her child, she said, and recommended that the ambulance be called to take him to the city receiving hospital.Then she went back into the house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个叫伊莉莎白·谢普斯通的女人过来了解了情况后，把男孩放到了一块活动遮板上。她还叫了医生，并不顾安·巴特尔的反应把男孩搬进了屋里。医生一赶到，安·巴特尔就立即警告他说自己不会付钱给他。小埃米尔卧床两个月，头一个月里一次身都没有翻过。他孤独地躺在那里，没人照看，除了义务加班的医生偶尔来看看他。他没有玩具，没有任何东西来消磨这漫长而枯燥的时间。没人对他说过一句好听的话，也没有人把手放在额头上安慰他，没有抚摸或者一个充满爱的温柔的表示——都没有，有的只是安·巴特尔的严厉指责，她无休止地重复说小埃米尔一点也不受欢迎。这样就能很好地理解，在这种环境中，那个孤独的、被人无视的小男孩心里是怎样滋生出那么多对人类的怨恨和敌意的，并且，在以后的岁月里，这些都以如此可怕的行为被发泄了出来，震惊了世界。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a woman, Elizabeth Shepstone, who came along, learned the situation, and had the boy placed on a shutter.It was she who called the doctor, and who, brushing aside Ann Bartell, had the boy carried into the house.When the doctor arrived, Ann Bartell promptly warned him that she would not pay him for his services.For two months the little Emil lay in bed, the first month on his back without once being turned over; and he lay neglected and alone, save for the occasional visits of the unremunerated and over-worked physician.He had no toys, nothing with which to beguile the long and tedious hours.No kind word was spoken to him, no soothing hand laid upon his brow, no single touch or act of loving tenderness—naught but the reproaches and harshness of Ann Bartell, and the continually reiterated information that he was not wanted.And it can well be understood, in such environment, how there was generated in the lonely, neglected boy much of the bitterness and hostility for his kind that later was to express itself in deeds so frightful as to terrify the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >似乎有些奇怪，落在安·巴特尔手里的埃米尔·格卢克竟能接受大学教育，但是理由很简单。她那一事无成的丈夫抛弃了她，在内华达金矿区发了笔横财，回到她面前时已经是个亿万富翁了。安·巴特尔讨厌这个男孩，立即把他送到一百英里开外的法里斯镇学院。在法里斯镇，这个腼腆敏感、孤独而又备受误解的小家伙比以前还要孤独。假期和节日的时候，他从不像别的孩子一样回家。相反，他在那些废弃了的建筑和场地里游逛，被仆人和花匠们当作朋友，或者被他们误解。大家记得他读了很多书，他在田野里或者壁炉前度过那些时光，鼻子总是戳到某本书的书页上。就是在那个时候，他用眼过度，不得不戴上眼镜，因此他登在1941年的报纸上的相片才如此显眼。</td>
		<td class="en">It would seem strange that, from the hands of Ann Bartell, Emil Gluck should have received a college education; but the explanation is simple.Her ne’er-do-well husband, deserting her, made a strike in the Nevada goldfields, and returned to her a many-times millionaire.Ann Bartell hated the boy, and immediately she sent him to the Farristown Academy, a hundred miles away.Shy and sensitive, a lonely and misunderstood little soul, he was more lonely than ever at Farristown.He never came home, at vacation, and holidays, as the other boys did.Instead, he wandered about the deserted buildings and grounds, befriended and misunderstood by the servants and gardeners, reading much, it is remembered, spending his days in the fields or before the fire-place with his nose poked always in the pages of some book.It was at this time that he over-used his eyes and was compelled to take up the wearing of glasses, which same were so prominent in the photographs of him published in the newspapers in 1941.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他是一个很突出的学生。若是勤奋的话，他可以走得更远，但他根本用不着勤奋。只要看一眼课本，他就全掌握了。结果就是他读了许多其他方面的书，半年里学到的东西比一般学生六年里能学到的还多。1909年，年仅14岁的他已经合乎——用学院院长的话说是“超出”——耶鲁或者哈佛的入学标准了。由于年幼，他没能进入那些大学，因此在1909年，他成为了历史悠久的鲍登学院的一名新生。1913年，他以最优异的成绩毕业，并立即跟着布拉德洛教授去了加利福尼亚的伯克利。埃米尔·格卢克一生之中发现的唯一一位朋友就是布拉德洛教授。教授的肺不好，因此他要从加利福尼亚搬到缅因去，当地州立大学的一纸教授聘书给他提供了不少便利。整个1914年，埃米尔·格卢克都住在伯克利，上专门的科学课程。那年年底，两个人的死改变了他的前途，也改变了他和人生的关系。布拉德洛教授的死带走了他认识的唯一一位朋友，而安·巴特尔的死则使他身无分文。她至死都厌恶着这个不幸的孩子，用一百美元割断了与他的关系。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a remarkable student.Application such as his would have taken him far; but he did not need application.A glance at a text meant mastery for him.The result was that he did an immense amount of collateral reading and acquired more in half a year than did the average student in half-a-dozen years.In 1909, barely fourteen years of age, he was ready—“more than ready” the headmaster of the academy said—to enter Yale or Harvard.His juvenility prevented him from entering those universities, and so, in 1909, we find him a freshman at historic Bowdoin College.In 1913 he graduated with highest honours, and immediately afterward followed Professor Bradlough to Berkeley, California.The one friend that Emil Gluck discovered in all his life was Professor Bradlough.The latter’s weak lungs had led him to exchange Maine for California, the removal being facilitated by the offer of a professorship in the State University.Throughout the year 1914, Emil Gluck resided in Berkeley and took special scientific courses.Toward the end of that year two deaths changed his prospects and his relations with life.The death of Professor Bradlough took from him the one friend he was ever to know, and the death of Ann Bartell left him penniless.Hating the unfortunate lad to the last, she cut him off with one hundred dollars.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二年，20岁的埃米尔·格卢克被招进加利福尼亚大学做一名化学讲师。时光静静地流逝，他尽职尽责地做这份能拿到薪水的苦差事，同时也一直当个学生，拿到了六个学位。虽然后来他只是以格卢克教授的身份为世人所知，但他有着多重身份，是社会学博士、哲学博士，还是科学博士。</td>
		<td class="en">The following year, at twenty years of age, Emil Gluck was enrolled as an instructor of chemistry in the University of California.Here the years passed quietly; he faithfully performed the drudgery that brought him his salary, and, a student always, he took half-a-dozen degrees.He was, among other things, a Doctor of Sociology, of Philosophy, and of Science, though he was known to the world, in later days, only as Professor Gluck.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >27岁时，因为《性与进步》一书的出版，他登上了各大报纸，一举成名。这本书至今仍是婚姻史和婚姻观方面的一部里程碑式著作。那是一本七百多页的大部头，极为细致准确，内容新颖得让人目瞪口呆。那是一本为科学家而作的书，并不是在算计着制造轩然大波。但是格卢克在最后一章只写了三行字，提到了试验婚姻假定的可取之处。报纸立刻抓住了这三行字，就像那时的一句俚语所说的那样，“用夸张失实的手法大肆宣传”，使得整个世界都在笑话埃米尔·格卢克，这个戴着眼镜的27岁年轻教授。摄影师狂拍他，记者对他围追堵截，全国的女性俱乐部都决定谴责他和他的不道德理论。在加利福尼亚大会上，谈到州政府对大学的拨款时，全体与会者都拿撤回拨款作威胁，要求开除格卢克——当然，在迫害他的人中，根本没有一个读过他的书，对他们来说，报纸对仅仅三行字的歪曲的解读已经足够了。埃米尔·格卢克从此与报社结怨。是他们，把他花了六年时间创作的严肃且本质上非常有价值的作品变成了笑柄，让它臭名昭著。他们永恒的忏悔没有用，他至死也没有原谅他们。</td>
		<td class="en">He was twenty-seven years old when he first sprang into prominence in the newspapers through the publication of his book, Sex and Progress.The book remains today a milestone in the history and philosophy of marriage.It is a heavy tome of over seven hundred pages, painfully careful and accurate, and startlingly original.It was a book for scientists, and not one calculated to make a stir.But Gluck, in the last chapter, using barely three lines for it, mentioned the hypothetical desirability of trial marriages.At once the newspapers seized these three lines, “played them up yellow,” as the slang was in those days, and set the whole world laughing at Emil Gluck, the bespectacled young professor of twenty-seven.Photographers snapped him, he was besieged by reporters, women’s clubs throughout the land passed resolutions condemning him and his immoral theories; and on the floor of the California Assembly, while discussing the state appropriation to the University, a motion demanding the expulsion of Gluck was made under threat of withholding the appropriation—of course, none of his persecutors had read the book; the twisted newspaper version of only three lines of it was enough for them.Here began Emil Gluck’s hatred for newspaper men.By them his serious and intrinsically valuable work of six years had been made a laughing-stock and a notoriety.To his dying day, and to their everlasting regret, he never forgave them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >报纸要对接下来降临在他身上的灾难负责。在那本书出版之后的五年里，他一直保持沉默。然而，沉默对于一个孤独的人来说，并非好事。我们可以怀着同情心推测一下埃米尔在那所人数众多的大学里所承受的极大孤独，因为他既没有朋友，也得不到同情。他只能依靠书本，于是他继续读书，大量学习。但是1927年，他接到了一封请柬，请他出席爱莫利维尔人类兴趣协会的活动。他并不相信自己的口头表达能力，我们在写这篇文章的时候，面前就摆着一份他的学术论文。这篇论文笔触清醒，学术水平高，论述科学，但是不得不提到的是，思想保守。但是他论及了一个地方，我引用他的原话就是，“在社会上产生的工业和社会改革”。一个在场的记者抓住了“改革”一词，将它从整段话中剥离出来，写了一篇曲解原意的报道，使得埃米尔·格卢克看起来是以个无政府主义者。一时间，人们对“格卢克教授是无政府主义者”反应热烈，全国的报纸都适时地对此做了特别报道。</td>
		<td class="en">It was the newspapers that were responsible for the next disaster that befell him.For the five years following the publication of his book he had remained silent, and silence for a lonely man is not good.One can conjecture sympathetically the awful solitude of Emil Gluck in that populous University; for he was without friends and without sympathy.His only recourse was books, and he went on reading and studying enormously.But in 1927 he accepted an invitation to appear before the Human Interest Society of Emeryville.He did not trust himself to speak, and as we write we have before us a copy of his learned paper.It is sober, scholarly, and scientific, and, it must also be added, conservative.But in one place he dealt with, and I quote his words, “the industrial and social revolution that is taking place in society.”A reporter present seized upon the word “revolution,” divorced it from the text, and wrote a garbled account that made Emil Gluck appear an anarchist.At once, “Professor Gluck, anarchist,” flamed over the wires and was appropriately “featured” in all the newspapers in the land.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他曾试图回应先前的报纸上的攻击，但是现在他保持沉默。怨恨已经侵蚀了他的灵魂。大学的教职人员希望他为自己辩护，但他闷闷不乐地拒绝了，他甚至拒绝参加一篇论文的答辩，尽管这样他就不用被开除了。他拒绝辞职，所以被学院开除了。必须补充说明的是，大学的校务委员和校长都承受着政治压力。</td>
		<td class="en">He had attempted to reply to the previous newspaper attack, but now he remained silent.Bitterness had already corroded his soul.The University faculty appealed to him to defend himself, but he sullenly declined, even refusing to enter in defence a copy of his paper to save himself from expulsion.He refused to resign, and was discharged from the University faculty.It must be added that political pressure had been put upon the University Regents and the President.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >遭受着迫害、诽谤和误解，这个孤独寂寞的人并未试图报复。他一辈子都承受着别人对他的冒犯，却从未冒犯过别人。但是他的怨恨还没有满到要溢出来的地步。他失去了工作，也没有任何收入，只得去找事做。他的第一份工是在旧金山的联邦钢铁厂，在那里的表现说明他是一个很有能力的制图员。就是在那里，他得到了关于战舰的第一手资料，了解了它们的构造。但是记者发现了他，并为他有了新工作而专门作报道。他立刻辞职，另找了一处，但是在记者一而再再而三地把他赶出六个职位之后，他坚强起来，厚着脸皮死不承认报纸对他的迫害。那是在他自己创办了一家位于奥克兰电报大道的电镀商店之后的事了。那是间小商店，雇了三个男人和两个男童。格卢克自己长时间地工作。夜复一夜，就如警察卡鲁在法院作证时说的，直到凌晨一两点，他才离开商店。就在那段时间里，他完善了汽油引擎的改良点火装置，由此得到专利权使用费，最终成为了富翁。</td>
		<td class="en">Persecuted, maligned, and misunderstood, the forlorn and lonely man made no attempt at retaliation.All his life he had been sinned against, and all his life he had sinned against no one.But his cup of bitterness was not yet full to overflowing.Having lost his position, and being without any income, he had to find work.His first place was at the Union Iron Works, in San Francisco, where he proved a most able draughtsman.It was here that he obtained his firsthand knowledge of battleships and their construction.But the reporters discovered him and featured him in his new vocation.He immediately resigned and found another place; but after the reporters had driven him away from half-a-dozen positions, he steeled himself to brazen out the newspaper persecution.This occurred when he started his electroplating establishment—in Oakland, on Telegraph Avenue.It was a small shop, employing three men and two boys.Gluck himself worked long hours.Night after night, as Policeman Carew testified on the stand, he did not leave the shop till one and two in the morning.It was during this period that he perfected the improved ignition device for gas-engines, the royalties from which ultimately made him wealthy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在1928年早春开办了这家电镀商店，也就在那一年，他不幸地爱上了艾琳·塔克利。现在难以想象，埃米尔·格卢克这样非凡的人就是无法成为一个非凡的情人。除了他的天分、孤僻和敏感，我们必须考虑到，他对女人一无所知。无论欲望的潮水如何在他心里澎湃，他对惯常的表达方式一窍不通，而他过分的羞怯注定了他的求爱之路不同寻常。艾琳·塔克利是个相当漂亮的姑娘，但是肤浅而轻浮。当时她在一家小糖果店上班，从格卢克的店里出来，穿过街道就是。他常常走进店里，要些冰激凌苏打水和柠檬汁，边喝边盯着她看。看起来这个女孩对他并不在意，只是在耍他。她说他很“古怪”。还有一次，她描述他的时候就叫他怪人，她说他坐在柜台边透过眼镜盯着她，而她注意到他时，他脸红口吃，突然局促不安地离开了小店。</td>
		<td class="en">He started his electroplating establishment early in the spring of 1928, and it was in the same year that he formed the disastrous love attachment for Irene Tackley.Now it is not to be imagined that an extraordinary creature such as Emil Gluck could be any other than an extraordinary lover.In addition to his genius, his loneliness, and his morbidness, it must be taken into consideration that he knew nothing about women.Whatever tides of desire flooded his being, he was unschooled in the conventional expression of them; while his excessive timidity was bound to make his love-making unusual.Irene Tackley was a rather pretty young woman, but shallow and light-headed.At the time she worked in a small candy store across the street from Gluck’s shop.He used to come in and drink ice-cream sodas and lemon-squashes, and stare at her.It seems the girl did not care for him, and merely played with him.He was “queer,” she said; and at another time she called him a crank when describing how he sat at the counter and peered at her through his spectacles, blushing and stammering when she took notice of him, and often leaving the shop in precipitate confusion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格卢克送给她最令人惊叹的礼物——一套银质茶具，一只钻石戒指，一套皮衣，一副剧院望远镜，一套沉重的多卷本《世界史》，还有一辆在他自己的店里全身镀了银的摩托车。现在这姑娘的情人上场了，他坚决反对她收下礼物，十分恼火，逼着她把格卢克各种奇异的礼物送回去。这个男人，威廉·舍伯恩，是个粗俗、冷淡、长着厚下巴的男人，工人出身，后来成了一个成功的小建筑承包商。格卢克弄不明白。他想弄明白，就试图在这姑娘晚上下班回家的路上和她谈谈。她向舍伯恩抱怨，于是一天夜里，他揍了格卢克一顿。他下手很重，因为从红十字急救医院的记录来看，那晚格卢克就是在那里就诊的，而且不得不在医院住了一个星期。</td>
		<td class="en">Gluck made her the most amazing presents—a silver tea-service, a diamond ring, a set of furs, opera-glasses, a ponderous History of the World in many volumes, and a motor-cycle all silver-plated in his own shop.Enters now the girl’s lover, putting his foot down, showing great anger, compelling her to return Gluck’s strange assortment of presents.This man, William Sherbourne, was a gross and stolid creature, a heavy-jawed man of the working class who had become a successful building-contractor in a small way.Gluck did not understand.He tried to get an explanation, attempting to speak with the girl when she went home from work in the evening.She complained to Sherbourne, and one night he gave Gluck a beating.It was a very severe beating, for it is on the records of the Red Cross Emergency Hospital that Gluck was treated there that night and was unable to leave the hospital for a week.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格卢克还是不明白。他继续从女孩那里寻求解释。由于害怕舍伯恩，他向警察局长提出申请，想随身携带左轮手枪。申请被驳回，报纸像往常一样对此大肆渲染。然后艾琳·塔克利就被杀害了，就在她和舍伯恩的婚期的前六天。那是个星期六的晚上。她在糖果店工作得很晚，十一点时带着一周的薪水离开。她乘圣巴勃罗大道上的一辆路面车辆，在第三十四大街下车，开始走三个街区回家。这是别人最后一次见到活着的她。第二天早上有人发现她被扼死在一处空地上。</td>
		<td class="en">Still Gluck did not understand.He continued to seek an explanation from the girl.In fear of Sherbourne, he applied to the Chief of Police for permission to carry a revolver, which permission was refused, the newspapers as usual playing it up sensationally.Then came the murder of Irene Tackley, six days before her contemplated marriage with Sherbourne.It was on a Saturday night.She had worked late in the candy store, departing after eleven o’clock with her week’s wages in her purse.She rode on a San Pablo Avenue surface car to Thirty-fourth Street, where she alighted and started to walk the three blocks to her home.That was the last seen of her alive.Next morning she was found, strangled, in a vacant lot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >警察立刻逮捕了埃米尔·格卢克。他怎么做都救不了自己。他被指控了，不仅仅是基于特定条件下的证据，还基于奥克兰警署“捏造”的证据。没有讨论，但是许多证据就被制造出来了。希恩上尉的证词是十足的伪证，很久以后有人证明，案发当晚他不仅不在案发现场附近，甚至都不在城里，而是在圣莱安德罗路的度假胜地。不幸的格卢克被判处终身监禁，关在圣金廷，然而报纸和公众认为这是个误判——他应该被判死刑。</td>
		<td class="en">Emil Gluck was immediately arrested.Nothing that he could do could save him.He was convicted, not merely on circumstantial evidence, but on evidence “cooked up” by the Oakland police.There is no discussion but that a large portion of the evidence was manufactured.The testimony of Captain Shehan was the sheerest perjury, it being proved long afterward that on the night in question he had not only not been in the vicinity of the murder, but that he had been out of the city in a resort on the San Leandro Road.The unfortunate Gluck received life imprisonment in San Quentin, while the newspapers and the public held that it was a miscarriage of justice—that the death penalty should have been visited upon him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格卢克在1929年的4月17号进了圣金廷监狱。那时他34岁。被囚禁的那三年半的孤独岁月里，他大部分时间都只能花在思考人类的不公上面。就在那段时间里，他彻底被怨恨吞噬，变成了一个愤世者。同一时期他还做了其他三件事：他写了著名的专著——《人类道德》，写了他著名的小册子——《清醒的罪犯》，并制定了他那可怖而变态的复仇计划。发生在他电镀店里的小插曲让他有了关于独一无二的复仇武器的灵感。就像他在供词里说到的那样，他在服刑期间就在理论上谋划好了每个细节，释放后就立即着手自己的复仇事业。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃米尔·格卢克窃笑着，继续着自己的路。他知道是怎么一回事。但是世人怎么会知道呢？他在自己那间位于奥克兰电报大道上的老电镀店里偶然发现了这个秘密。事发时，瑟斯顿电力公司在他的商店附近建了一家无线电报站。很快他的电镀原料池就出了故障。原料池的线路有很多接头坏掉了，格卢克在调查中发现电线接头处有微小的焊接点。这些焊接点降低了电阻，使得多余的电流通过溶液，把它“煮沸”，破坏了电镀工作。但是这些焊接点是怎么来的呢？格卢克在考虑这个问题。他的推论很简单。无线电报站建成前，电镀原料很正常。而电报站建成，原料就出了问题。因此问题出在无线电报站上。但是怎么发生的呢？他很快就找到了答案。如果通过放电可以操纵隔了三千英里洋面的粉末检波器，那么自然地，通过粉末检波器效应，四百英尺远的无线电报站的放电也可以影响原料池线路的坏接头了。</td>
		<td class="en">And Emil Gluck chuckled and went his way.He knew.But how was the world to know?He had stumbled upon the secret in his old electroplating shop on Telegraph Avenue in the city of Oakland.It happened, at that time, that a wireless telegraph station was established by the Thurston Power Company close to his shop.In a short time his electroplating vat was put out of order.The vat-wiring had many bad joints, and, on investigation, Gluck discovered minute welds at the joints in the wiring.These, by lowering the resistance, had caused an excessive current to pass through the solution, “boiling” it and spoiling the work.But what had caused the welds? was the question in Gluck’s mind.His reasoning was simple.Before the establishment of the wireless station, the vat had worked well.Not until after the establishment of the wireless station had the vat been ruined.Therefore the wireless station had been the cause.But how?He quickly answered the question.If an electric discharge was capable of operating a coherer across three thousand miles of ocean, then, certainly, the electric discharges from the wireless station four hundred feet away could produce coherer effects on the bad joints in the vat-wiring.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The case was complete in Bannerman’s mind, though in the interval of waiting he worked up the details.In this he was ably assisted by George Brown, an operator employed by the Wood’s System of Wireless Telegraphy.When the Plutonic arrived off Sandy Hook she was boarded by Bannerman from a Government tug, and Emil Gluck was made a prisoner.The trial and the confession followed.In the confession Gluck professed regret only for one thing, namely, that he had taken his time.As he said, had he dreamed that he was ever to be discovered he would have worked more rapidly and accomplished a thousand times the destruction he did.His secret died with him, though it is now known that the French Government managed to get access to him and offered him a billion francs for his invention wherewith he was able to direct and closely to confine electric discharges.“What!” was Gluck’s reply— “to sell to you that which would enable you to enslave and maltreat suffering Humanity?”And though the war departments of the nations have continued to experiment in their secret laboratories, they have so far failed to light upon the slightest trace of the secret.Emil Gluck was executed on December 4, 1941, and so died, at the age of forty-six, one of the world’s most unfortunate geniuses, a man of tremendous intellect, but whose mighty powers, instead of making toward good, were so twisted and warped that he became the most amazing of criminals.</td></tr>
