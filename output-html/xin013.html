		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I remembered perfectly the handsome, slender youth who led the cotillons with such frenzied agility and gracefulness that he had been nicknamed “the fury.” Going back into the dim, distant past, I recalled a story which I had heard and forgotten, one of those stories to which one listens but forgets, and which leave but a faint impression upon the memory.</td>
		<td class="en">我清楚地记得那个帅气、身材修长的年轻人，他领起舞来既灵活又优雅的狂热劲头，因此人们给他起了个绰号“复仇精灵”。回望模糊遥远的过去，我回想起一个我曾听过却已经遗忘的故事，那是一个让人听了就忘、只在记忆中留下一缕微弱印象的故事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There was something about love in it. Little by little the shadows cleared up, and the face of a young girl appeared before my eyes.</td>
		<td class="en">那其中有一段爱情故事。阴影一点儿一点儿地消除，一个年轻女孩的脸浮现在我眼前。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then her name struck me with the force of an explosion: Mademoiselle de Mandel.</td>
		<td class="en">然后，她的名字就一下子撞进我的脑海：德曼德尔小姐。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">此刻我记起了所有的事情。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was indeed a love story, but quite commonplace.</td>
		<td class="en">那的确是一个爱情故事，但是再平常不过了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The young girl loved this young man, and when I had met them there was already talk of the approaching wedding.</td>
		<td class="en">那个年轻的女孩爱着这个年轻的小伙子，而且当我见到他们的时候，他们已经谈婚论嫁了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The youth seemed to be very much in love, very happy.</td>
		<td class="en">这对年轻人看起来十分相爱，非常幸福。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I raised my eye to the net, where all the packages which had been brought in by the servant were trembling from the motion of the train, and the voice of the servant came back to me, as if he had just finished speaking.</td>
		<td class="en">我抬眼看那网兜，所有那些被仆人放进去的包裹都在随火车的运行而颤动，而那个仆人的话又萦绕在我耳边，就像是他刚刚才讲完一样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He had said: “There, monsieur, that is all.</td>
		<td class="en"> 他曾说：“行了，就这些了，先生。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There are five of them: the candy, the doll, the drum, the gun, and the pate de foies gras.”</td>
		<td class="en">一共有五样——糖果、洋娃娃、鼓、电子枪，还有菰鹅肝酱。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then, in a second, a whole romance unfolded itself in my head.</td>
		<td class="en">于是，一部完整的罗曼史瞬间展现在我脑海里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was like all those which I had already read, where the young lady married notwithstanding the catastrophe, whether physical or financial; therefore, this officer who had been maimed in the war had returned, after the campaign, to the young girl who had given him her promise, and she had kept her word.</td>
		<td class="en">它跟我读过的所有罗曼史一样。在所有那些小说里，那位年轻女孩，在遭受了肉体上的或经济上的灾难后，还是嫁给了她的未婚夫。因此，这个已经在战争中残废了的军官，在战役结束后回到了那个年轻女孩的身边。她曾向他许下的诺言，也兑现了。 </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I considered that very beautiful, but simple, just as one, considers simple all devotions and climaxes in books or in plays.</td>
		<td class="en">我认为那非常美好，但却纯粹，就像一个人认为书里或剧本里的各种奉献精神和高潮情节都是纯粹的一样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It always seems, when one reads or listens to these stories of magnanimity, that one could sacrifice one’s self with enthusiastic pleasure and overwhelming joy. But the following day, when an unfortunate friend comes to borrow some money, there is a strange revulsion of feeling.</td>
		<td class="en">当我们阅读或聆听到这些高尚的故事时，我们似乎总是会能带着满腔的热情和无法抗拒的快乐做出自我牺牲。但是第二天，当一个不幸的朋友前来借一些钱的时候，我们却会有一种莫名的厌恶感。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But, suddenly, another supposition, less poetic and more realistic, replaced the first one. Perhaps he had married before the war, before this frightful accident, and she, in despair and resignation, had been forced to receive, care for, cheer, and support this husband, who had departed, a handsome man, and had returned without his feet, a frightful wreck, forced into immobility, powerless anger, and fatal obesity.</td>
		<td class="en">然而，忽然之间，另一种不够诗意却更为现实的推测取代了第一个。也许在战争爆发之前，在那次可怕的意外之前他就已经结婚了；而她，绝望而无可奈何地被迫接受、照顾、鼓励和供养这个丈夫。他离开时是个帅气的男人，回来时却失去了双腿，只剩一副可怕的残躯，无奈地落到无法活动、徒劳生气和注定会发胖的境地。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Was he happy or in torture?</td>
		<td class="en">他是幸福，还是备受煎熬呢？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I was seized with an irresistible desire to know his story, or, at least, the principal points, which would permit me to guess that which he could not or would not tell me.</td>
		<td class="en">我无法遏制地想知道他的故事，或者，至少让我知道那些重要的情节，那就足以让我推测他不能或不愿告诉我的部分。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Still thinking the matter over, I began talking to him. We had exchanged a few commonplace words; and I raised my eyes to the net, and thought: “He must have three children: the bonbons are for his wife, the doll for his little girl, the drum and the gun for his sons, and this pate de foies gras for himself.”</td>
		<td class="en">依然思考着这个问题，我开始跟他聊天。我们寒暄了几句之后，我抬眼看向那网兜，心想：“他一定有三个孩子：那糖果是给他妻子的，那洋娃娃是给他的小女儿的，那鼓和电子枪是给他的儿子们的，而这菰鹅肝酱是给他自己的。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Suddenly I asked him: “Are you a father, monsieur?”</td>
		<td class="en">突然我问他：“您是一位父亲吗，先生？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He answered: “No, monsieur.”</td>
		<td class="en">他回答说：“不是的，先生。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I suddenly felt confused, as if I had been guilty of some breach of etiquette, and I continued: “I beg your pardon.</td>
		<td class="en">我突然感到困惑了，就像是因破坏某些礼仪而深感愧疚一样，于是我继续说道：“请原谅。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I had thought that you were when I heard your servant speaking about the toys.</td>
		<td class="en">当我听到您的仆人谈到那些玩具时，我一度以为您是一位父亲。 </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >One listens and draws conclusions unconsciously.”</td>
		<td class="en">一个人听到那样的话会不自觉地得出那样结论的。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He smiled and then murmured: “No, I am not even married.</td>
		<td class="en">他微笑了起来，然后喃喃道：“不，我连婚都没结。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I am still at the preliminary stage.”</td>
		<td class="en">我仍是单身。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I pretended suddenly to remember, and said:</td>
		<td class="en">我装作突然想起来，并说：</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Oh!</td>
		<td class="en">“哦！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >that’s true!</td>
		<td class="en">没错！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When I knew you, you were engaged to Mademoiselle de Mandel, I believe.”</td>
		<td class="en">我记得当我认识您的时候，您跟德曼德尔小姐了订婚了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Yes, monsieur, your memory is excellent.”</td>
		<td class="en">“是的，先生，您的记忆力相当不错。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I grew very bold and added: “I also seem to remember hearing that Mademoiselle de Mandel married Monsieur—Monsieur—”</td>
		<td class="en">我大胆地补充说：“我好像还记得，听说德曼德尔小姐嫁给了——呃——”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He calmly mentioned the name: “Monsieur de Fleurel.”</td>
		<td class="en">他平静地提及那个名字：“弗勒先生。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Yes, that’s it!</td>
		<td class="en">“没错，就是他！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I remember it was on that occasion that I heard of your wound.”</td>

		<td class="en">我直直地盯着他的脸，他脸红了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >His full face, which was already red from the oversupply of blood, turned crimson.</td>
		<td class="en">他整张脸，原本就因血液供应过剩而发红，如今变成深红了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He answered quickly, with a sudden ardor of a man who is pleading a cause which is lost in his mind and in his heart, but which he does not wish to admit.</td>
		<td class="en">当一个人为一个在精神上和心里已经败诉，却不愿承认的案件辩护时，都会带着一种突如其来的热情，他快速回答道：</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“It is wrong, monsieur, to couple my name with that of Madame de Fleurel.</td>
		<td class="en">“先生，把我的名字和德弗勒太太的联系在一起是错的。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When one marries, monsieur, it is not in order to parade one’s generosity; it is in order to live every day, every hour, every minute, every second beside a man; and if this man is disfigured, as I am, it is a death sentence to marry him!</td>
		<td class="en">先生，一个人结婚不是为了展示自己的慷慨大方，而是为了和另一个人一起度过每一天、每一个小时、每一分、每一秒。如果那个人身体有残，就像我一样，那嫁给他就等于给自己判了死刑！</td></tr>
