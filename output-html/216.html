		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克没读过报纸，要不然他就能知道一场灾难正在酝酿之中。这场灾难不只关系到他自己，还关系到从普吉特海湾到圣迭戈每一条强壮、耐寒的滨海长毛犬。因为人们通过在北极的黑暗中探索发现了一种黄色金属，再加上轮船和运输公司又把这个发现说得天花乱坠，所以成千上万的人都正在涌向北方。这些人需要很多狗，而且这些狗必须是大型犬。他们要有强壮的体力去从事艰苦的工作，要有厚厚的毛皮去抵御严寒。</td>
		<td class="en">Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tidewater dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego.Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland.These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克住在充满阳光的圣克拉拉山谷中的一所大房子里。这里被称作法官米勒先生的家。这栋房子旁边有条大道，树阴遮住了房子的一半。透过树阴往里看，房子四周围着开阔而阴凉的走廊。房子紧靠着砂石铺就的大车道，大车道在宽广的草地中蜿蜒而过，上方是纵横交错的高大白杨树的枝条。房屋后面要比前面宽敞得多。这里有由十几个马夫和男仆管理的大马厩，有一排排被藤蔓覆盖的仆人住的小屋，还有一列整齐有序、望不到头的外屋，以及长长的葡萄棚架、绿色的牧场、果园和成块的浆果地。此外，还有一间自流井的泵房和一个水泥贮水池。米勒法官家的那些男仆们早上跳进水池子里泡一泡，直到炎热的下午都会感觉很凉快。</td>
		<td class="en">Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.Judge Miller’s place, it was called.It stood back from the road, half-hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides.The house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars.At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front.There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches.Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miler’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这一大片领地都是由巴克统治的。他出生在这里，并已经在这里生活四年了。是的，这里是还有别的狗。在这么大的一块地方自然还有别的狗，但他们根本就无足轻重。他们来去匆匆，要么住在很拥挤的狗窝里，要么默默地生活在房子的隐秘处，像日本哈巴狗图茨或墨西哥无毛狗伊莎贝尔那样。这些家伙都很奇怪，他们很少将鼻子伸出门外或跑到庭院里。另外，还有至少二十只猎狐犬，图茨和伊莎贝尔只要透过窗口向他们看一眼，他们就害怕地大叫起来，像求饶似的，于是一群拿着扫帚和拖把的女仆就过来保护他们。</td>
		<td class="en">And over this great demesne Buck ruled.Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life.It was true, there were other dogs.There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count.They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground.On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，巴克既不是看家狗也不是窝里养的狗。这整片领土都是他的。他有时会一头扎进游泳池，有时会和法官的儿子们一起打猎。在漫长的黄昏或清晨，他陪着法官的女儿莫莉和艾丽斯散步。在寒冷的冬夜里，他围着书房里烧得旺旺的炉火，躺在法官的脚下。他给法官的孙子们当马骑，或和他们在草地上打滚嬉戏；他护着他们进行激动人心的探险，走到马厩院子的泉水旁，甚至越过泉水走到牧场那边和成片的浆果地里。在那群猎狐犬之中，他骄傲而昂首阔步地走着，而对图茨和伊莎贝尔，他则完全漠视。因为他是王——他在米勒法官家的这个地盘上统治着一切匍匐着的、爬行着的和飞翔着的生物，就连某些人也包括在内。</td>
		<td class="en">But Buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog.The whole realm was his.He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches.Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的父亲埃尔莫是一条巨大的圣伯纳犬，一直是法官密不可分的伙伴，而巴克有望沿着他父亲的路走下去。只是巴克没有他父亲那么大，他只有140磅重，因为他母亲是一条苏格兰牧羊犬。但是，140磅的体重，加上优越生活和普遍尊重所赋予的高贵气质，使他带着一种王者派头。在这四年的幼年时期，他一直都过着一种心满意足的贵族式生活。他很为自己感到骄傲，甚至有一点自负，就像那些乡绅，因为处在孤立的状态，有时会变得自大。但是他已经保全了自己，没让自己变成一条被宠坏的看家狗。打猎和诸如此类的户外嗜好使他控制了脂肪增长，也使他的肌肉变得更加结实；对他来说，作为需要冷水浴的宗族成员，对水的热爱一直都能使他精神振奋、保持健康。</td>
		<td class="en">His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father.He was not so large—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds—for his mother, She, had been a Scotch shepherd dog.Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion.During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation.But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog.Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这就是巴克1897年秋天的生活方式。当时克朗代克矿藏的发现把世界各地的人都拽到了严寒的北方。可是巴克不读报，他也不知道那个园丁助手曼纽尔会是个令人憎恶的家伙。他有个积重难返的恶习。他爱玩一种中国的赌钱游戏。而在赌博时，他又有个难以克服的弱点，那就是太守规矩，这使他必然要受到惩罚。因为下赌注需要钱，而他一个园丁助手的工资还不够养活老婆和那么一大群孩子。</td>
		<td class="en">And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel, one of the gardener’s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance.Manuel had one besetting sin.He loved to play Chinese lottery.Also, in his gambling, he had one besetting weakness—faith in a system; and this made his damnation certain.For to play a system requires money, while the wages of a gardener’s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那时法官正在葡萄种植者协会开会，仆人们在忙着组织一个运动俱乐部，就在这个难忘的晚上，曼纽尔做了件背信弃义的事。没有人看见他和巴克穿过了果园，而巴克自己也以为这只是散步。除了一个孤零零的男子，没有人看见他们到了一个叫做“大学公园”的小旗站。这个男子和曼纽尔谈了几句，钱币便在他们中间叮当作响。</td>
		<td class="en">The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers’ Association, and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of Manuel’s treachery.No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll.And with the exception of a solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as College Park.This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“交货前，你得把这东西缠好了。”那个陌生人粗鲁地说。曼纽尔拿了条粗绳子，把它绕在巴克脖子上的项圈下。</td>
		<td class="en">“You might wrap up the goods before you deliver them,” the stranger said gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck’s neck under the collar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >曼纽尔说：“用劲拧，你得紧紧地勒住它。”于是陌生人嘟哝了一声，爽快地答应了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Twist it, and you’ll choke him plenty,” said Manuel, and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克泰然自若地接受了绳子。当然，他这么做是不同寻常的。但他已经学会了要信任他所认识的人，并相信他们的智慧超过他自己的智慧。但是当绳子的两端抓在陌生人手里的时候，他气势汹汹地狂吠起来。他只是暗示了自己的不愉快，并骄傲地认为暗示就是命令。但让他感到诧异的是，这条绳子紧紧地绕在他的脖子上，让他喘不上气来。一怒之下，他跳起来扑向这个人。那人没等他扑到身上就紧紧地抓住了他的喉咙，灵巧地一拧，将他仰面摔在地上。然后那人残忍地绷紧了绳子。当巴克愤怒地挣扎时，舌头都从嘴里伸出来了，巨大的胸脯徒然地喘着粗气。有生以来他从没被这么卑贱地对待过，有生以来他也从来没有如此愤怒过。但是他的力气渐渐耗尽了，双目怒视着。当火车被招呼停下来，两人把他扔进行李车厢时，他什么都不知道了。</td>
		<td class="en">Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity.To be sure, it was an unwonted performance but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own.But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger’s hands, he growled menacingly.He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to intimate was to command.But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck, shutting off his breath.In a quick rage he sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back.Then the rope tightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely.Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry.But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接下来他隐约地意识到他的舌头受了伤，意识到他在一个什么交通工具里颠簸摇晃。火车头发出粗哑刺耳的尖叫声，呼啸着驶过一个交叉路口，让他知道自己身在何处。他随法官旅行过很多次，对乘坐行李车是什么感觉了然于心。他睁开双眼，眼里闪现怒火，那种愤怒就像被绑架的国王的强烈愤怒一样无法抑制。那个人跳起来撬他的喉咙，但是巴克反应太快了。他用牙紧紧地咬住那个人的手，直到他再次感觉要窒息了才松开。</td>
		<td class="en">The next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance.The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was.He had traveled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car.He opened his eyes, and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnaped king.The man sprang for his throat, but Buck was too quick for him.His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“瞧，这狗痉挛病发作了。”那个男人边说着边藏起被咬烂的手，以免被走过来的行李员看到。刚才搏斗的声响把行李员吸引过来了。“我帮老板把他带到旧金山去。那里有一流的兽医，说是能把他治好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yep, has fits,” the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the baggage man, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle.“I’m taking ’im up for the boss to ’Frisco.A crack dog doctor there thinks that he can cure him.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在旧金山码头一个酒馆的小后屋里，关于那晚的行程，那人口若悬河地说了自己的事。</td>
		<td class="en">Concerning that night’s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself, in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他发牢骚道：“我弄这条狗才挣50美元，下次哪怕是给我1000美元现金我也不干。”</td>
		<td class="en">“All I get is fifty for it,” he grumbled, “and I wouldn’t do it over for a thousand, cold cash.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的手用一块血迹斑斑的手绢包扎着，右边的裤腿从膝盖到脚踝全被撕破了。</td>
		<td class="en">His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那另一个混蛋挣了多少钱？”酒馆老板问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“How much did the other mug get?” the saloon-keeper demanded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他回答道：“100美元。他不肯少一分钱，所以帮帮忙吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A hundred,” was the reply.“Wouldn’t take a sou less, so help me.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那就是150美元啦。”酒店老板算了算，说道，“他绝对值这点钱，要不然我就是个笨蛋了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That makes a hundred and fifty,” the saloon-keeper calculated, “and he’s worth it, or I’m a squarehead.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >诱拐狗的那个人拆去了带血的绷带，看了看自己被咬伤的手。“我不会得狂犬病吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">The kidnaper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand.“If I don’t get hydrophobia—” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >酒馆老板大笑着说：“那可说不定，因为你天生就该被吊死。”他又说道：“来，没走之前过来再帮我一把。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’ll be because you was born to hang,” laughed the saloon-keeper.“Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,” he added.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克头昏目眩，喉咙和舌头也疼得难以忍受。尽管被勒得简直只剩半条命了，他还试图反抗折磨他的人。但他一次次被摔倒在地，被扼住喉咙，直到他们成功地将套在他脖子上的那粗重的黄铜项圈锉掉。接着，他们把绳子拿走了，又把巴克猛地扔进一个像笼子一样的装货箱里。</td>
		<td class="en">Dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life half throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors.But he was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck.Then the rope was removed, and he was flung into a cage-like crate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他躺在那里，忍受着剩下来的痛苦长夜，也医治着自己的愤怒和受伤的自尊心。他不明白发生的一切到底意味着什么。这些奇怪的人，他们要他做什么？为什么他们一直把他关在这个狭窄的装货箱里？巴克不知道为什么，但他模糊地感觉到有种灾难正向他逼近，他感到很压抑。那天晚上，小屋的门咯吱打开的时侯，他好几次都跳了起来，期望能看到法官，或者至少也应该能看到那些仆人们。可每一次都是酒馆老板那张肿胀的脸，这人在微弱的烛光下盯着他。每一次，巴克喉咙里颤抖着发出的欢快叫声都变成了凶猛的咆哮声。</td>
		<td class="en">There he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath and wounded pride.He could not understand what it all meant.What did they want with him, these strange men?Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate?He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity.Several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see the Judge, or the boys at least.But each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle.And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck’s throat was twisted into a savage growl.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >酒馆老板让他独自呆着。早晨，来了四个人，他们抬起了装货箱。巴克认定这些人全是来折磨他的，因为他们看上去都像魔鬼似的，穿着破破烂烂，不修边幅。他隔着栅栏愤怒地冲他们狂吠。他们只是笑笑，用棍子戳戳他。他敏捷地用牙咬棍子来攻击，后来才意识到这正好是他们想让他做的。意识到这一点后，他愠怒地躺了下来，任凭他们把箱子抬到了货车上。然后他和那个关他的箱子就开始从一个个人的手上传递。快递办公室的职员们负责看管他，他被装进另一辆货车。接着，一辆卡车将他和各种各样的箱子、包裹一起运上了一艘渡轮。然后，他又随卡车从渡轮上下来，来到了一个很大的火车站。最后，他被装进一辆邮政快车。</td>
		<td class="en">But the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate.More tormentors, Buck decided, for they were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at them through the bars.They only laughed and poked sticks at him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that was what they wanted.Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon.Then he, and the crate in which he was imprisoned, began a passage through many hands.Clerks in the express office took charge of him; he was carted about in another wagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels, upon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot, and finally he was deposited in an express car.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两天两夜，这辆邮政快车被沿途一路呼啸的火车头拉着向前开进。这两天两夜，巴克没吃没喝。他愤怒至极，第一次看见快递邮差向他走过来，他就狂吠起来，而那些人就以戏弄他作为报复。他猛地扑向箱子的栏杆，哆嗦着、口吐白沫，于是他们就嘲笑他、奚落他。他们就像那些可恶的狗一样对他乱吼乱叫，还发出猫叫似的声音，而且还挥着胳膊，欢呼着。他知道，这一切都太愚蠢了。可他们越是践踏他的尊严，他就越是愤怒，这种愤怒不断加剧。他一点都不在乎自己有多么饿，但缺水却使他非常痛苦，这使他的愤怒被煽动到疯狂至极的程度。因此，紧张的神经、极度的敏感以及那些人的虐待使他燥热起来，而喉咙和舌头又干又肿的炎症症状，又激化了他的躁动情绪。</td>
		<td class="en">For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank.In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him.When he flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at him and taunted him.They growled and barked like detestable dogs, mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed.It was all very silly, he knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed and waxed.He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch.For that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >让他高兴的是：他脖子上的绳子被解下了。那绳子使那些人占了优势，这很不公平。但现在那绳子不在了，他要表现给他们看。他们再也不能给自己的脖子系上绳子。对此，他决心已定。两天两夜，巴克没吃没喝，在这痛苦的两天两夜里，他积累了所有的愤怒，不管是谁要是先冒犯他，他都要狠狠地报复。他双眼充血，变成了一个狂暴的魔鬼。他的变化如此之大，就是法官本人也很可能认不出他来了。快递邮差们在西雅图把他绑着弄下火车，才算是松了口气。四个人小心翼翼地把箱子从货车抬到一个由高墙围着的小后院里。一个壮汉走了出来，他穿着领口松垂的红毛衣，给司机在本子上签了字。巴克猜测那个人就是下一个要折磨自己的人，他狠命地朝栏杆撞去。那个人冷酷地笑了笑，手里拿着一把斧子和一根大棒。</td>
		<td class="en">He was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck.That had given them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.They would never get another rope around his neck.Upon that he was resolved.For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him.His eyes turned bloodshot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend.So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle.Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small, high-walled back yard.A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.That was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled himself savagely against the bars.The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >司机问：“你不是现在就要把他放出来吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You ain’t going to take him out now?” the driver asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对！”这人答道，把斧子劈在箱子上，往里看了看。</td>
		<td class="en">“Sure,” the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >把他抬进来的那四个人一下子散开了。为了安全起见，他们爬到了墙头上，准备看巴克会干什么。</td>
		<td class="en">There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克冲向裂开的木头，用牙齿奋力撕咬着，猛冲过去与之搏斗。斧子落在箱子哪里，他就在哪里咆哮。他狂怒焦躁地想早点出来，而那个穿红毛衣的人也想放他出来，只不过，前者有多焦躁后者就有多冷静。</td>
		<td class="en">Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging and wrestling with it.Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来，你这个红眼的魔鬼！”当他把木箱弄得足以让巴克的身子出来的时候，他说道。与此同时，他把斧子扔到了一边，把大棒换到了右手上。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Buck’s body.At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克真变成红眼睛的魔鬼了。他竭尽全身力气跳了出来，毛发竖立，口吐白沫，充血的眼里闪着狂暴的光。他带着两天两夜来被压抑的愤怒，用他那140磅重的身体向那个人直冲过去。半空中，就在他要咬住那个人的时候，他被猛地一击，身体无法向前了，他所有的牙齿就像被折磨人的夹子夹住了似的，都挤在了一起。他在空中转了一圈，后背和侧身完全撞在了地上。在他的一生中，他从没被大棒袭击过，因而不明白是怎么回事。随着一声咆哮——像是狂吠又更像是尖叫，他又重新站了起来，蹦到了空中。又被一击，他被完全击倒在地。这次他明白了，原来那是根大棒，但他的疯狂使他不再谨慎小心了。他进攻了十几次，而那根大棒每一次都能将他击退，并把他击倒在地。</td>
		<td class="en">And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his bloodshot eyes.Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights.In mid-air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip.He whirled over, fetching the ground on his back and side.He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did not understand.With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air.And again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground.This time he was aware that it was the club, but his madness knew no caution.A dozen times he charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在遭到一次特别狠的击打之后，他趴倒在地上，头晕目眩，再也无法进攻了。他四肢无力地摇摆着，血从鼻子、嘴和耳朵里流出来，美丽的毛皮被带血的口水喷溅得到处都是血点。接着，那个人走上前来，故意冲他的鼻子猛地一击。他之前承受的所有疼痛，和这一次剧痛相比都显得微不足道。伴着一声几乎是狮子般残暴的吼叫，他又一次猛地扑向那个人。可是那个人把大棒从右手换到左手，冷静地抓住了他的下颚，同时向下后方一拧。巴克在空中划了一整个圈，接着又转了半圈，然后头和胸脯狠狠地砸在了地上。</td>
		<td class="en">After a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush.He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose.All the pain he had endured was nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this.With a roar that was almost lion-like in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man.But the man, shifting the club from right to left, cooly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward.Buck described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后他又猛冲了一次。那个人机警地向他一击，他故意等了很久才击打过去。巴克便缩成了一团，垮了下来，被打得完全失去了知觉。</td>
		<td class="en">For the last time he rushed.The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >墙上一个人狂热地喊道：“我得说一句，他驯起狗来可真利索。”</td>

		<td class="en">By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played out.The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make up lost time, pushed them late and early.The first day they covered thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to the Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well up toward the Five Fingers.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">At the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad.She announced her condition by a long, heart-breaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck.He had never seen a dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic.Straight away he raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so great was her madness.He plunged through the wooded breast of the island, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the main river, and in desperation started to cross it.And all the time, though he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind.Francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back, still one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that Francois would save him.The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly’s head.</td></tr>

Then he was a masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery.He was preeminently cunning, and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对领导地位的争夺不可避免地就要来了。巴克期盼着这一刻的到来。他期盼这一刻，因为这是他的本性，因为他对雪道征途有一种不可名状、无法理解的自豪感，这种自豪紧紧地攫住了他。这种自豪感使那些狗艰苦地劳作，直到咽下最后一口气；这种自豪诱惑他们心甘情愿地在挽具下死去，如果把他们从挽具里放出来只会让他们无比伤心。这是一种戴夫掌着雪橇舵所拥有的自豪，也是索拉克斯全力向前拉着雪橇的自豪。从撤营开始，这种自豪就激励着他们，使他们从愁眉不展、郁郁寡欢的畜生变成了神经紧绷、热情饱满和抱负远大的生灵。这种自豪感整天激励着他们，使他们晚上一头倒在搭好的营地时，就回到那种忧郁的骚动和不满之中。就是这种自豪支持着斯皮茨，使他痛打那些拉撬时犯错、偷懒的雪橇狗，还有那些在早晨套挽绳时躲起来的雪橇狗。也同样是这种自豪，使他害怕巴克可能会当上狗队的头领。这当然也是巴克的自豪。</td>
		<td class="en">It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come.Buck wanted it.He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and trace—that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness.This was the pride of Dave as wheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night, letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and discontent.This was the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a possible lead-dog.And this was Buck’s pride, too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克公开挑战对方的领导权。他去插手斯皮茨与他要惩罚的那些偷懒者之间的事情。他这么做是故意的。有天晚上下了场大雪。第二天早晨，一贯装病的派克就没有露面。他安稳地藏在雪堆下的窝里。弗朗索瓦大声地喊他，找他半天也没找到。斯皮茨大发雷霆。他在盛怒之下跑遍了整个营地，闻着、扒着每一个可能的地方。恐怖的吼叫使藏身在洞里的派克吓得浑身发抖。</td>
		<td class="en">He openly threatened the other’s leadership.He came between him and the shirks he should have punished.And he did it deliberately.One night there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the malingerer, did not appear.He was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow.Francois called him and sought him in vain.Spitz was wild with wrath.He raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every likely place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and shivered in his hiding-place.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him, Buck flew with equal rage, in between.So unexpected was it, and so shrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet.Pike, who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny, and sprang upon his overthrown leader.Buck, to whom fair play was a forgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz.But Francois, chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought his lash down upon Buck with all his might.This failed to drive Buck from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into play.Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many times offending Pike.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it craftily, when Francois was not around.With the covert mutiny of Buck, a general insubordination sprang up and increased.Dave and Sol-leks were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.Things no longer went right.There was continual bickering and jangling.Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck.He kept Francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarreling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe, fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种机会当时并没有出现，他们在一个沉闷的下午到达了道森地区，但这场决斗早晚会来的。这里有很多人，还有数不清的狗，巴克发现那些狗都在干活。看上去好像规定了狗必须干活一样。整个白天，他们都排着长队，来来回回走过主街。到了晚上，他们身上铃铛声还不绝于耳。他们把造木屋用的原木和柴火拖运到矿上，干着在圣克拉拉山谷地区马匹所能干的一切活计。巴克不时遇见南方狗，但他们多数都是那些像野狼一样的爱斯基摩犬。每天晚上九点、十二点、三点，这些狗就很有规律地高声唱起一种夜歌。这是一种奇怪又可怕的歌，但巴克也喜欢跟着一起唱。</td>
		<td class="en">But the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come.Here were many men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work.It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.All day they swung up and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling bells still went by.They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa Clara Valley.Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed.Every night, regularly, at nine, at twelve, and three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie chant, in which it was Buck’s delight to join.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他往前跑着，越来越明显地感到大地上有一种新的骚动。在这儿有一种陌生的生命，这种生命不同于整个夏天都在那儿的生命。他不用再靠某种微妙、神秘的方式来感知这一事实了。鸟在谈论着它，松鼠也在叽叽喳喳地议论着它，就连微风也在耳语着。有好几次他停了下来，深深地呼吸着清晨的新鲜空气，思考着这个使他加速奔跑的信息。巴克有种大难临头的感觉，虽然灾难还没有发生，但是他却还是有一种压抑感。当跨过最后一道分水岭，沿着通向营地的山谷跑下去时，他行动更加谨慎了。</td>
		<td class="en">As he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land.There was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer.No longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle, mysterious way.The birds talked of it, the squirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it.Several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs, reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed.He was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity already happened, and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >离营地还有三英里，巴克看到了一条崭新的小路，使他脖子上的毛呈波状起伏，竖了起来。这条小路一直伸向营地和约翰·桑顿那里。巴克赶紧前进，敏捷而悄无声息。每一根神经都绷紧拉直了，他警惕地注意到：种种细节描述了一个故事——除了结局还未知。他的鼻子从多方面告诉他，那种生物走过他现在走的这条路径。他注意到森林里是一片意味深长的寂静。鸟已经离开了。松鼠也都藏了起来。他只看见了一只松鼠，一只皮毛光滑的灰色的家伙，平伏在一根灰色的枯枝上，看起来这个松鼠就像枯枝的一部分，像是树上长出的木本赘生物。</td>
		<td class="en">Three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling.It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.Buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story—all but the end.His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was traveling.He remarked the pregnant silence of the forest.The bird life had flitted.The squirrels were in hiding.One only he saw—a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the wood itself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克像滑过的影子一样悄悄地移动着，他的鼻子突然往旁边一扭，仿佛被一股确实的力量吸引并牵了过去。然后他循着这种新气味走进灌木丛，发现了尼格。尼格侧身躺着，死在曾挣扎着爬起过的地方。一支箭射穿了尼格的身体，箭头露在一边，箭尾带着羽毛露在另一边。</td>
		<td class="en">As Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it.He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一百码开外，巴克走到了另一只约翰·桑顿在道森买下的拉橇狗跟前。这只狗是在生死搏斗中被打死的，他就躺在路当中。巴克没有停下，从他身边绕了过去。从营地里传来了好多个微弱的声音，高高低低，好像在唱着什么调子。巴克贴着地面爬到那片空地的边缘，发现汉斯脸朝下躺着，浑身中箭，像头豪猪。与此同时，巴克仔细看了一下云杉树搭成的小屋，屋里的景象使他脖子和肩膀上的毛发直直竖了起来。难以抑制的一阵狂怒席卷了他。他不知不觉地咆哮了一声，吼声凶狠得可怕。这是他有生以来最后一次容许自己愤怒的情感取代狡猾和理性，因为他对约翰·桑顿深沉的爱使他失去了理智。</td>
		<td class="en">A hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled dogs Thornton had bought in Dawson.This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle, directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him without stopping.From the camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a sing-song chant.Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing, he found Hans, lying on his face, feathered with arrows like a porcupine.At the same instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders.A gust of overpowering rage swept over him.He did not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity.For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason, and it was because of his great love for John Thornton that he lost his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那些叶海特人正在云杉木屋的残骸旁跳着舞，他们听到了这恐怖的咆哮后，就看到一只动物向他们扑来，他们以前从没见过这样的动物。那就是巴克，简直就是一股狂怒的活的飓风，怀着毁灭一切的愤怒扑向他们。他跳起来扑向最前面的那个人（这个人是叶海特人的酋长），把他的喉咙咬了一个大口子，直到裂开的颈静脉血如泉涌。他没有停下来继续咬第一个牺牲者，而是向下一个咬去，他一跃把第二个人的喉咙也撕开了一个大口子。没有谁能挡得住他。他冲进这群人中间，撕着，扯着，毁灭着。他不断发起可怕的攻击，使他们射向他的箭一一落空。实际上，他的动作快得难以想象，那些印第安人们又紧紧挤成一团，但他们只能互相射伤。有个年轻的猎手猛地向半空中的巴克投去一支长矛，结果却刺中了另一个猎手的胸膛。因为用力过猛，那矛头不仅穿过对方的背脊，还穿了出来。 叶海特人大惊失色，惊恐万分地逃向森林，像逃避恶魔的降临一样。</td>
		<td class="en">The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before.It was Buck, a live hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy.He sprang at the foremost man—it was the chief of the Yeehats—ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.He did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man.There was no withstanding him.He plunged about in their very midst, tearing, rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him.In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his movements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear at Buck in mid-air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond.then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to the woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴克活像魔王撒旦的化身，他狂怒地追赶他们。当他们逃向树林时，巴克把他们像鹿群一样拖垮。 这是叶海特人致命的一天。他们四散逃命，直到一周以后，那些幸存者才在一个低谷里集合起来，查点损失的人数。至于巴克，追累了之后，他就回到了那个荒凉的营地。他发现皮特刚刚惊醒就被杀死在毯子里。桑顿拼命挣扎的痕迹在地上清晰可见。巴克嗅着这点点滴滴的气息，走到了深水池边。池边躺着斯基特，她的头和前腿浸泡在水里，她一直战斗到了最后。水池本身是浑浊的，并且受斜水槽的污染，能有效地掩盖池子里的东西，而约翰·桑顿就在那里。因为巴克是跟着桑顿的气味走进水里的，周围再也没有什么其他痕迹了。</td>
		<td class="en">And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees.It was a fateful day for the Yeehats.They scattered far and wide over the country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.As for Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated camp.He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise.Thornton’s desperate struggle was fresh-written on the earth and Buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool.By the edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay Skeet, faithful to the last.The pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it contained John Thornton; for Buck followed his trace into the water, from which no trace led away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一整天，巴克都是在池边郁郁地沉思，或者围着营地转来转去。死亡就是停止运动，就是生命在活的物体中终止和消逝，这他知道。他也知道约翰·桑顿死了。这给他留下了无限的空虚，多少有点像饥饿。但是饥饿能够用食物来填补，可是这种空虚却使他疼了又疼。时不时地，当他停下来凝视那些叶海特人的尸体时，他才能暂时忘记这种疼痛。这时他就无比自豪，比他体验过的任何自豪都要强烈。他杀过地球上最高贵的动物——人。他是在面对着棍棒与獠牙的法则时杀的人。他好奇地闻着这些尸体。杀死他们太容易了！杀死一条爱斯基摩犬都比杀死他们难。要不是因为他们有弓箭、长矛和大棒，他们根本不是他的对手。从那以后他再也不会怕这些人了，除非他们手里拿着弓箭、长矛或大棒。</td>
		<td class="en">All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the lives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead.It left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which ached and ached, and which food could not fill.At times, when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain of it; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself—a pride greater than any he had yet experienced.He had killed man, the noblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang.He sniffed the bodies curiously.They had died so easily.It was harder to kill a husky dog than them.They were no match at all, were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs.Thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows, spears and clubs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >夜幕降临，一轮满月从树梢升起，高高地升入天空。月光洒在大地上，使大地沐浴在一种朦胧的白昼里。随着夜晚的到来，巴克在池边忧伤地哀悼。突然，他感到森林里有一种新生命的骚动，这种骚动不同于与叶海特人造成的骚动。他站起来，倾听着，嗅着。从远处飘来了一阵微弱而尖锐的叫声，紧接着又传来了相似的尖叫声的合奏。随着时间的流逝，这种尖叫声变得越来越近，越来越响亮。巴克又一次把它们认定为另一个世界听到过的声音，它们一直萦绕在巴克的记忆里。他走到了林中开阔地的中央，倾听着。这正是那种呼唤，那种音调繁多的呼唤，比以前更富有诱惑力和强迫力。他从没有像现在这样乐于服从那种呼唤。约翰·桑顿已经死了。最后的牵挂断了。人类和人类的要求不再束缚他了！</td>
		<td class="en">Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky, lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day.And with the coming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck came alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made.He stood up, listening and scenting.From far away drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps.As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder.Again Buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory.He walked to the center of the open space and listened.It was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compelling than ever before.And as never before, he was ready to obey.John Thornton was dead.The last tie was broken.Man and the claims of man no longer bound him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狼群像叶海特人那样，跟在迁移的驼鹿群两侧，以猎取活物为食。狼群最后越过溪流密布的林区，侵入到了巴克所在的这座山谷。月光如水，洒满了空地，狼群如一场银色洪水奔泻而至。巴克就站在空地的中央，他一动不动，像尊雕像，等待他们的到来。群狼被吓住了。巴克站在那里，那么镇静、那么庞大。静止片刻后，最勇敢的一只狼朝巴克直奔而来。像闪电一样，巴克跳了起来，猛地一口咬断了对方的脖子。然后他站住了，像刚才那样一动不动。被咬短脖子的狼在他身后痛苦地滚动着。另外三只也前赴后继地扑了上来。但他们一只接一只地被击退了，血从喉咙和肩膀的裂口处喷涌而出。</td>
		<td class="en">Hunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the flanks of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck’s valley.Into the clearing where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; and in the center of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue, waiting their coming.they were awed, so still and large he stood, and a moment’s pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him.Like a flash Buck struck, breaking the neck.Then he stood, without movement, as before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him.Three others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they drew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这下够了，整个狼群都向前猛冲了过来，一拥而上，乱挤在一起，因急于打倒猎物，他们乱作一团。巴克惊人的速度和灵活使他处于有利地位。他以后腿为中心，飞快地转圈，奋力撕咬着，同时抵挡来自各个方向的攻击。他飞快地旋转着，形成一道不可攻破的防线，从四面八方保护着自己。为了防止狼群从后面袭击，他被迫后退，先退过水池，又退到了小河湾的河床上，抵住高高的沙砾河岸停下了。他沿着河岸后退，一直退到了掘矿人在那儿挖就的垂直角落里。在这个角落里，他陷入了困兽之斗，三面都有保护，只需对付前方。</td>
		<td class="en">This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pellmell, crowded together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.Buck’s marvelous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.Pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side.But to prevent them from getting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the creek bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank.He worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他应付得很好，半个小时后，狼群终于溃退了。在溃逃中，所有的狼都吐出舌头，耷拉着，白色的獠牙在月光下闪着残酷的白光。一些受伤的狼躺在地上，努力地抬起头，向前竖着耳朵。另一些趴在那里看着巴克，还有一些在舔着池塘里的水。一只身材硕长、瘦瘠而灰白的狼小心地走了过来，态度十分友好。巴克认出他来了，就是那个和他一起跑了一天一夜的荒野兄弟。那个兄弟轻轻地呜呜叫着，巴克也叫了一声。他们的鼻子碰在了一起。</td>
		<td class="en">And so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited.The tongues of all were out and lolling, the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight.Some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet, watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool.One wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly manner, and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day.He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they touched noses.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一只瘦削的、历经战役而疮痍满目的老狼慢慢地向他们走来。巴克扭了一下嘴唇，准备咆哮，但和他嗅了嗅鼻子。然后那只老狼坐了下来，鼻孔指向月亮，爆发出了一声长长的嗥叫。其余的狼都坐了下来，也都嗥叫了起来。现在巴克不会弄错了，他听出这就是那种呼唤的声音！他也坐下，嚎叫了起来。嗥叫完了，他从角落里走出来，群狼围住他，用那种半是友好、半是野蛮的方式嗅他。领头的狼带着狼群大声尖叫，猛地转身冲进了森林。狼群跳了起来跟在后面，齐声尖叫。巴克也跟在他们的后面，和那个荒野兄弟并肩跑进了大森林。他一边跑一边大叫。</td>
		<td class="en">Then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward.Buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him.Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke out the long wolf howl.The others sat down and howled.And now the call came to Buck in unmistakable accents.He, too, sat down and howled.This over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner.The leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods.The wolves swung in behind, yelping in chorus.And Buck ran with them, side by side with the wild brother, yelping as he ran.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到这里，巴克的故事可以圆满结束了。过了没几年，叶海特人便注意到，森林里狼的品种有了变化。因为有人看见狼群中有一些头上和口鼻四周的皮毛上有棕褐色的斑，而沿着胸口正中有一块条状的白毛。然而更为异常的是，叶海特人经常讲起有一条“狗怪”跑在狼群的前头。他们害怕这只“狗怪”，因为他比他们狡猾，经常在最寒冷的冬天从他们的营地里偷东西，掠夺他们捕到的猎物，杀死他们的看家狗，连他们最勇敢的猎手都没被放在眼里。</td>
		<td class="en">And here may well end the story of Buck.The years were not many when the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white centering down the chest.But more remarkable than this the Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack.They are afraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they, stealing from their camps in the fierce winters, robbing their traps, slaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不仅如此，还有更恐怖的。有些猎手一去不返，有些猎手被族人发现他们的喉咙被残忍地撕开了，周围到处都是狼群的脚印，这些雪地上的脚印比他们过去所见到过的狼的脚印要大得多。每年秋天，当叶海特人追踪那些驼鹿的时候，有一个山谷他们永远不敢进去。谈到那个恶鬼怎么会挑选那座山谷作栖息地时，坐在火堆旁的妇女就不免悲伤起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Nay, the tale grows worse.Hunters there are who fail to return to the camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf.Each fall, when the Yeehats follow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they never enter.And women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an abiding-place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，每个夏季，总会有一位叶海特人不认识的探望者来到这个山谷。来者是一条巨大的、披着亮丽皮毛的狼，跟其他所有的狼有相似之处，又有不同之处。他独自穿过景色美丽的林地，走进树丛中间一块开阔的空地。一股黄色的液体从腐烂了的驼鹿皮袋子里流出来，渗入地面，黄液流过的地方长出了一溜长长的青草，腐烂的植物覆盖了它，把黄色遮盖得不见阳光。他在这里沉思了一会儿，离开前仰天一声长啸，听起来是那么悠长、那么悲伤。</td>
		<td class="en">In the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which the Yeehats do not know.It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like, and yet unlike, all other wolves.He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees.Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mold overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但他也不总是孤独的。当漫长的冬夜到来，狼群会追着他们的猎物走进这个低谷。透过苍白的月色或是在闪烁的北极光里，可以看见他奔跑在狼群的最前头，高大的身影越过了他的同伴。他敞开嗓门，高唱起一曲新生世界之歌，那就是狼群之歌。</td>
		<td class="en">But he is not always alone.When the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.</td></tr>
