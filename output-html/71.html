		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >假如你晚饭后沿着百老汇大街散步，一边给自己十分钟的时间享受雪茄，一边盘算着是去体会一出有趣的悲剧呢，还是去欣赏轻歌舞剧中所蕴含的严肃。突然，一只手放在你的胳膊上。转过身，你迎面看到一位美人摄人心魄的眼睛。她身着俄罗斯貂皮大衣，周身珠光宝气，艳丽无比。她猛地把一个滚烫的、涂了黄油的面包卷塞到你手里，飞快地拿出一把闪亮的微型剪刀，剪掉你大衣上的第二个扣子，意味深长地喊出“平行四边形！”五个字，然后便飞身飘过十字街口，同时还胆怯地回头一望。</td>
		<td class="en">Suppose you should be walking down Broadway after dinner, with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville.Suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm.You turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and Russian sables.She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll, flashes out a tiny pair of scissors, snips off the second button of your overcoat, meaningly ejaculates the one word, “parallelogram!” and swiftly flies down a cross street, looking back fearfully over her shoulder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这将是纯粹的冒险。你会接受吗？你不会。你会尴尬得满脸通红，羞怯地丢掉面包卷，继续沿百老汇大街往前走，双手无力地摸索着，寻找那颗丢失的纽扣。你肯定会这样做的，除非你是那凤毛麟角的有福之人。在他们身上，纯粹的冒险精神尚存。</td>
		<td class="en">That would be pure adventure.Would you accept it?Not you.You would flush with embarrassment; you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down Broadway, fumbling feebly for the missing button.This you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >真正的冒险家从来都为数不多。那些像这样被记入书中的冒险家大多数是那些利用新发明创造的商人。他们出去追寻自己想要的东西——金羊毛、圣杯、女人的爱情、金银财宝，以及荣誉和名望。真正的冒险家前行时漫无目的，也不斤斤计较得失，直面和迎接未知的命运。一个很好的例子就是一个“回头的浪子”——他启程返乡时的故事。</td>
		<td class="en">True adventurers have never been plentiful.They who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods.They have been out after the things they wanted—golden fleeces, holy grails, lady loves, treasure, crowns and fame.The true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate.A fine example was the Prodigal Son—when he started back home.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >半吊子的冒险家——勇敢而杰出的人物——数不胜数。从十字军东征到帕利塞兹丘陵，这些人丰富了历史和小说的艺术，以及历史小说这一行当。但是，他们中的每一个人都有一个奖品要赢取，一个球去踢，一个私人目的要达到，一场比赛去角逐，一招新的击剑第三姿势要使出，一个名字要雕刻，有件事要和人理论——因此，他们不能算是真正的冒险家。</td>
		<td class="en">Half-adventurers—brave and splendid figures—have been numerous.From the Crusades to the Palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction.But each of them had a prize to win, a goal to kick, an axe to grind, a race to run, a new thrust in tierce to deliver, a name to carve, a crow to pick—so they were not followers of true adventure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这座大城市里，“浪漫”和“冒险”这一对孪生姐妹总是外出寻找优秀的追求者。我们漫步街头时，她们便诡秘地偷窥我们，一次又一次地乔装改扮，考验我们。不知什么原因，我们会突然向上看，只见窗户里的那张脸仿佛出自我们画廊里熟悉的肖像画；在一条沉睡的通衢大道上，我们听到从一所空荡荡的窗板紧闭的房子里传来的痛苦惊惧的喊叫；出租马车车夫没有在我们熟悉的路边停车，而是把我们丢在了一扇陌生的门前，一个人，面带微笑为我们开门，示意我们进去；一张写有字的纸片从圣坛高高的花格框架上飘落到我们的脚边；我们和匆匆路过的人群中的陌生人对视一眼，交换着瞬间产生的厌恶、爱慕和恐惧之情；一场大雨披头而来——我们的伞或许可以为圆月的女儿和恒星系的大堂妹遮雨；在每条街的拐弯处，手绢飘然下落，手指向我们示意，目光把我们纠缠，于是乎，关于冒险的种种失落的、孤独的、狂喜的、神秘的、危险的、千变万化的线索，便悄然交到了我们手中。不过，我们这些人中几乎没人愿意接受并追查这些线索。社会习俗犹如一根通条从我们背部直插而下，使我们都渐渐变得全身僵硬。我们继续前行；将来某一天，我们会在十分枯燥的生命尽头开始反思，我们的浪漫史苍白暗淡，也就是一两次婚姻、一个存放于保险箱抽屉里的绸缎做的玫瑰花饰，以及与蒸汽散热器的一辈子的争斗。</td>
		<td class="en">In the big city the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers.As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises.Without knowing why, we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits; in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house; instead of at our familiar curb, a cab-driver deposits us before a strange door, which one, with a smile, opens for us and bids us enter; a slip of paper, written upon, flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of Chance; we exchange glances of instantaneous hate, affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds; a sudden douse of rain—and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the Full Moon and first cousin of the Sidereal System; at every corner handkerchiefs drop, fingers beckon, eyes besiege, and the lost, the lonely, the rapturous, the mysterious, the perilous, changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers.But few of us are willing to hold and follow them.We are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs.We pass on; and some day we come, at the end of a very dull life, to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two, a satin rosette kept in a safe-deposit drawer, and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >鲁道夫·斯坦纳是一个真正的冒险家。几乎每个傍晚时分，他都会离开走廊尽头的小卧室，外出寻找出乎意料、稀奇古怪的事情。在他看来，一生中最令人感兴趣的经历莫过于在下一个拐角处可能发生的怪事。他甘愿去冒险，以致于有时候误入歧途。有两次，他都是在警察局过的夜；他发觉自己一次又一次地成了诡计多端且贪图钱财的骗子玩弄的傻瓜；他的手表和钱财也成了他接受别人的谄媚诱惑所付出的代价。但是，他依旧热情不减，欣然接受出现在眼前的每一次挑战，继续他愉快的冒险历程。</td>
		<td class="en">Rudolf Steiner was a true adventurer.Few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious.The most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner.Sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths.Twice he had spent the night in a station-house; again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters; his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement.But with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天傍晚，鲁道夫正在老城区中部的一条穿越市区的大街上溜达。两旁的人行道上充斥着人流——有匆忙往家赶的人，也有为参加有千支蜡烛照明的、华而不实的餐会而放弃回家的、焦躁不安的人。</td>
		<td class="en">One evening Rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city.Two streams of people filled the sidewalks—the home-hurrying, and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand-candle-power table d’hote.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻的冒险家仪表堂堂，安详且警觉地信步前行。白天，他是一家钢琴行的售货员。他把他的领带穿在一个黄宝石环上，而不是用领带别针来固定。他曾给一家杂志的编辑写过信，称利比小姐写的《朱尼的爱情考验》是对他人生影响最大的一本书。</td>
		<td class="en">The young adventurer was of pleasing presence, and moved serenely and watchfully.By daylight he was a salesman in a piano store.He wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin; and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that @Junie’s Love Test@ by Miss Libbey, had been the book that had most influenced his life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走着走着，他看到一家饭馆前的人行道旁放着一个玻璃柜，里面的一副牙齿在剧烈地打战，这一开始似乎将他的注意力（伴随着瞬间的恶心）吸引到那家饭馆去了；但再一看，他就发现了隔壁高悬的牙医诊所的通电文字招牌。一个巨人似的黑人，荒诞地穿着一件红色绣花大衣，一条黄色裤子，还戴着一顶军帽。他正小心翼翼地向那些愿意接受他卡片的过路行人发放宣传卡。</td>
		<td class="en">During his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention (with a qualm), to a restaurant before which it was set; but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist’s sign high above the next door.A giant negro, fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat, yellow trousers and a military cap, discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >鲁道夫已经对这种牙医宣传方式司空见惯了。一般情况下，他会径直走过散发牙医宣传卡片的人，不予理睬；但今晚这个非洲黑人如此敏捷地把一张卡片塞到他手里，以至于他手握卡片，对他的成功技艺赞赏一笑。</td>
		<td class="en">This mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to Rudolf.Usually he passed the dispenser of the dentist’s cards without reducing his store; but tonight the African slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >又前行了几码后，他漫不经心地瞥了一眼这张卡片。他一惊，翻过卡片，颇有兴趣地再次细瞧。卡片的一面是空白；另一面用墨水写着“绿门”两个字。接着，鲁道夫看到前面三步远的地方，一人边走边把黑人给他的卡片扔掉了。鲁道夫把卡片捡了起来。卡片上印有牙医的姓名、地址和常见的“镶假牙”和“做齿桥”的时间表，以及徒有虚名的“无痛”手术承诺。</td>
		<td class="en">When he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently.Surprised, he turned it over and looked again with interest.One side of the card was blank; on the other was written in ink three words, “The Green Door.”And then Rudolf saw, three steps in front of him, a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed.Rudolf picked it up.It was printed with the dentist’s name and address and the usual schedule of “plate work” and “bridge work” and specious promises of “painless” operations.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >爱冒险的钢琴销售员在街角停了下来，思考了一番。接着他穿过大街，走过一个街区，再穿过大街，掉头加入到迎面而来的人流中。第二次路过时，他似乎并没有注意到那个黑人，漫不经心地接过了递给他的卡片。走出十步之后，他检查起这张卡片。这张卡片上也用和第一张卡片上一样的字迹写着“绿门”二字。他前后的三四个行人随手把卡片扔在了人行道上。卡片落地，空白面朝上。鲁道夫把它们翻了过来。每张上面都印着牙医“诊疗室”的传奇故事。</td>
		<td class="en">The adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered.Then he crossed the street, walked down a block, recrossed and joined the upward current of people again.Without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time, he carelessly took the card that was handed him.Ten steps away he inspected it.In the same handwriting that appeared on the first card “The Green Door” was inscribed upon it.Three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him.These fell blank side up.Rudolf turned them over.Every one bore the printed legend of the dental “parlours.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“冒险”这个调皮的小妖精几乎不需要向鲁道夫·斯坦纳这位忠实的信徒招手两次。但是已经两次了，另外，探索仍在继续呢。</td>
		<td class="en">Rarely did the arch sprite Adventure need to beckon twice to Rudolf Steiner, his true follower.But twice it had been done, and the quest was on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >鲁道夫慢慢回到黑巨人站的地方，旁边就是那盛着咔嗒咔嗒作响的牙齿的玻璃柜。这一次他经过时，却没有接到卡片。尽管穿得花里胡哨、荒谬可笑，可那个埃塞俄比亚黑人站在那儿却自然地展现出一种原始的尊严。他礼貌地把卡片送给部分行人，让其他的行人不受干扰地走过。每隔半分钟，他就喊出一句刺耳的、让人听不懂的话，声音类似于有轨电车售票员含混的吆喝或只唱不说的大歌剧里的唱词。这回黑人不仅拒绝给卡片，而且对鲁道夫来说，那巨大且发亮的黑脸还向他透出一种冷淡的，甚至可以说是轻蔑的鄙夷之色。</td>
		<td class="en">Rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth.This time as he passed he received no card.In spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb, the Ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood, offering the cards suavely to some, allowing others to pass unmolested.Every half minute he chanted a harsh, unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera.And not only did he withhold a card this time, but it seemed to Rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold, almost contemptuous disdain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种神色刺痛了冒险家。他从中读到了无声的指责，有人曾发现他就是需要这种指责。无论卡片上那神秘的字迹可能意味着什么，那个黑人都已两次从人群中选择了他来接受这个信息；而现在，黑人似乎在责备他缺乏才智和气魄，不敢接受这个谜题。</td>
		<td class="en">The look stung the adventurer.He read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting.Whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean, the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient; and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >站在熙来攘往的人流旁边，年轻人迅速打量了一下这幢楼，他认为他的奇遇就会发生在这里。这幢楼有五层高。地下室设有一个小餐馆。</td>
		<td class="en">Standing aside from the rush, the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie.Five stories high it rose.A small restaurant occupied the basement.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，一楼正大门紧闭，这里好像是用来存放妇女头饰用品或皮草的。通过一闪一闪的通电文字招牌，可以看出二楼是牙医诊所。往上去，写有各种语言的招牌组成了一座巴别塔。招牌挤挤挨挨，奋力显示着看手相的人、裁缝、乐师和医生的住处所在。再往上，悬挂的窗帘和窗台上白色的奶瓶宣告那里是家庭生活区。</td>
		<td class="en">The first floor, now closed, seemed to house millinery or furs.The second floor, by the winking electric letters, was the dentist’s.Above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists, dressmakers, musicians and doctors.Still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >结束了他的全面考察后，鲁道夫轻快地迈上了高高的石砌台阶，进入楼里。登上两段铺着地毯的楼梯后，他继续向上走；然后他在最高处停了下来。走廊里光线昏暗，点着两盏苍白的煤气喷灯，其中的一个在他右边很远的地方，另一个近点，在他左手边。他向那盏较近的灯望去，透过那苍白的光晕，他看到了一扇绿门。他犹豫了片刻；接着，他仿佛看到了那个发卡片的非洲杂耍者傲慢无礼的冷笑；于是，他径直朝那扇绿门走过去，敲了敲门。</td>
		<td class="en">After concluding his survey Rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house.Up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued; and at its top paused.The hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one—far to his right, the other nearer, to his left.He looked toward the nearer light and saw, within its wan halo, a green door.For one moment he hesitated; then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the African juggler of cards; and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >像这样等待门开的分分秒秒都极其漫长。他的呼吸因为这次真正的冒险而急促起来。在这些绿色的门板条后面什么都有可能出现啊！赌徒正在玩命；奸诈的无赖狡猾而熟练地布下陷阱；美人爱上了勇士，因此盘算着让他把自己追到手；危险、死亡、爱情、失望、嘲弄——都有可能成为他鲁莽敲门后的回应。</td>
		<td class="en">Moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure.What might not be behind those green panels!Gamesters at play; cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill; beauty in love with courage, and thus planning to be sought by it; danger, death, love, disappointment, ridicule—any of these might respond to that temerarious rap.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >里面传来微弱的窸窣声，然后门慢慢地打开了。一个不足二十岁的女孩站在那里，面色苍白、步履蹒跚。她松开门把手，身体虚弱地摇晃着，一只手在摸索着。鲁道夫扶住她，让她在靠墙的一张褪了色的长沙发上躺下。他关上门，借着煤气灯摇曳的火光飞快地环视了一下屋子。整洁，但极度贫穷，这就是他得出的结论。</td>
		<td class="en">A faint rustle was heard inside, and the door slowly opened.A girl not yet twenty stood there, white-faced and tottering.She loosed the knob and swayed weakly, groping with one hand.Rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall.He closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet.Neat, but extreme poverty was the story that he read.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那女孩静静地躺着，仿佛处于昏迷之中。鲁道夫兴奋地环顾四周，想找一只桶。那些人必须得放在桶上滚来滚去，那些——不，不对，给溺水的人才需要那样做。他开始用自己的帽子给她扇风。这一招真管用，因为他圆顶硬呢帽的帽沿戳到了她的鼻子，于是她睁开了眼睛。然后，这个年轻人发现，她的脸庞的确正是他心中那藏满了熟悉肖像画的秘密画廊里缺失了的画像。坦诚的灰眼睛、冒失地向外翘着的小鼻子、豌豆藤卷须一样的栗色卷发，这一切似乎正是他所有精彩冒险经历的完美结局和回报。但这张脸却苍白消瘦，让人怜惜。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl lay still, as if in a faint.Rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel.People must be rolled upon a barrel who—no, no; that was for drowned persons.He began to fan her with his hat.That was successful, for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes.And then the young man saw that hers, indeed, was the one missing face from his heart’s gallery of intimate portraits.The frank, grey eyes, the little nose, turning pertly outward; the chestnut hair, curling like the tendrils of a pea vine, seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures.But the face was wofully thin and pale.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女孩平静地看着他，笑了。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl looked at him calmly, and then smiled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我晕倒了，对不对？”她虚弱地问，“唉，谁又顶得住啊？三天了，粒米未进，你试试看！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Fainted, didn’t I?” she asked, weakly.“Well, who wouldn’t?You try going without anything to eat for three days and see!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天哪！”鲁道夫惊叫着跳了起来，“等我回来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Himmel!” exclaimed Rudolf, jumping up.“Wait till I come back.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他冲出绿门，跑下楼去。不到二十分钟他便又回来了，用脚尖踢了踢门，叫她来开门。他双臂抱着一大堆从食品杂货店和餐馆买来的东西。他把东西放在桌子上——面包加黄油、冷盘肉、蛋糕、馅饼、泡菜、牡蛎、一只烤鸡、一瓶牛奶和热茶。</td>
		<td class="en">He dashed out the green door and down the stairs.In twenty minutes he was back again, kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it.With both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant.On the table he laid them—bread and butter, cold meats, cakes, pies, pickles, oysters, a roasted chicken, a bottle of milk and one of redhot tea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真是荒唐，”鲁道夫气势汹汹地说，“怎么能不吃饭硬撑着。你必须停止为了选举打这种赌。晚饭准备好了。”他扶她坐到桌边的椅子上，问道：“有杯子盛茶吗？”“窗边的架子上有。”她回答。他拿杯子回来时，看见她双眼狂喜地放着光，正开始吃一大块莳萝泡菜，那是她凭着女人一贯正确的本能从众多纸袋里搜出来的。他笑着夺走泡菜，倒了满满一杯牛奶。“先把这个喝了，”他命令道，“然后你得再喝点茶，然后再来一只鸡翅。如果你感觉非常好，那你明天就可以吃泡菜了。至于现在，如果你把我当成你的客人，那我们就开始吃晚餐吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“This is ridiculous,” said Rudolf, blusteringly, “to go without eating.You must quit making election bets of this kind.Supper is ready.”He helped her to a chair at the table and asked: “Is there a cup for the tea?”“On the shelf by the window,” she answered.When he turned again with the cup he saw her, with eyes shining rapturously, beginning upon a huge Dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman’s unerring instinct.He took it from her, laughingly, and poured the cup full of milk.“Drink that first” he ordered, “and then you shall have some tea, and then a chicken wing.If you are very good you shall have a pickle to-morrow.And now, if you’ll allow me to be your guest we’ll have supper.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把屋里仅余的另一把椅子拉过来。茶水让女孩的眼睛泛起了光泽，也让她恢复了一些气色。她开始吃起来，就像一只饿极了的野兽，吃得既挑剔又凶猛。年轻人的出现和给她的帮助，在她看来似乎是很自然的事情——这好像并不是因为她轻视传统习俗，而是因为巨大的压力赋予了她抛弃人类虚假造作之态的权利。但是，随着力量的逐渐恢复，她开始觉得舒服一些，某种应有的传统观念又冒了出来；于是她开始给他讲自己的小故事。那不过是每天都会发生的成千上万件事情中的一件，在城市中早已司空见惯了——故事讲的是商店女店员工资微薄，又被以各种“罚款”的名义多加克扣，扣的钱增加了商家暴涨的利润；她因为生病没有去上班；并因此丢了饭碗，没了希望，然后——冒险家就来叩响了这扇绿门。</td>
		<td class="en">He drew up the other chair.The tea brightened the girl’s eyes and brought back some of her colour.She began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal.She seemed to regard the young man’s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing—not as though she undervalued the conventions; but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human.But gradually, with the return of strength and comfort, came also a sense of the little conventions that belong; and she began to tell him her little story.It was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day—the shop girl’s story of insufficient wages, further reduced by “fines” that go to swell the store’s profits; of time lost through illness; and then of lost positions, lost hope, and—the knock of the adventurer upon the green door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，对鲁道夫来讲，这段往事听起来就像《伊利亚特》一样气势恢宏，或像《朱尼的爱情考验》中的危急关头一样扣人心弦。</td>
		<td class="en">But to Rudolf the history sounded as big as the Iliad or the crisis in @Junie’s Love Test@.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“想想你居然吃了那么多苦啊。”他大声叹道。</td>
		<td class="en">“To think of you going through all that,” he exclaimed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“确实是挺受罪的。”女孩一脸严肃地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“It was something fierce,” said the girl, solemnly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你在城里就没有亲戚朋友吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And you have no relatives or friends in the city?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一个都没有。”</td>
		<td class="en">“None whatever.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我在这世界上也是孑然一身。”鲁道夫停了一下后说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am all alone in the world, too,” said Rudolf, after a pause.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你这样说我很高兴。”女孩立刻回应道。不知怎的，听到女孩认可自己失去亲人的处境，年轻人竟觉得一阵开心。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am glad of that,” said the girl, promptly; and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然，她垂下眼睑，深深叹了口气。</td>
		<td class="en">Very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我困得不行了，”她说，“我感觉非常好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m awfully sleepy,” she said, “and I feel so good.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >鲁道夫站起来，拿起帽子。“那我告辞了。好好睡一觉，对你有好处。”</td>
		<td class="en">Then Rudolf rose and took his hat.“I’ll say good-night.A long night’s sleep will be fine for you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他伸出手，她握住他的手，说了声“晚安”。可她的眼睛分明在问着一个问题，那么生动、那么坦诚、那么哀婉地表达着，以至于他不得不用话语来回答。</td>
		<td class="en">He held out his hand, and she took it and said “good-night.”But her eyes asked a question so eloquently, so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，我明天还来，看你是不是好点儿了。你可不能这么轻易就摆脱我哦。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I’m coming back to-morrow to see how you are getting along.You can’t get rid of me so easily.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而后，她在门口问了一句：“你怎么会来敲我的门的？”似乎他如何来到这里与他来了这里这一事实相比显得无关紧要。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, at the door, as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come, she asked: “How did you come to knock at my door?”</td></tr>
