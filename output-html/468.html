		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（这是一个发生在作者父亲有生之年的真实故事。）</td>
		<td class="en">[A REAL INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE LIFE OF THE WRITER’S FATHER.]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当时时局异常，战争前线并不是唯一可以冒险的地方。战时，我恰好是在家中经历了一些最让人激动的场面。看到悬挂在我剑旁的那把旧科尔特式左轮手枪了吗？在部队的五年里，我一直带着它，它不止一次帮我摆脱了严重的困境。</td>
		<td class="en">The times were strange then, and at the front was not the only place to have adventures.During the war, some of the most stirring scenes I took part in were right at home.You see that old Colt’s revolver which hangs by my sword?I carried it through my five years in the army, and more than once it helped me out of a bad scrape.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >1863年，我休假30天，回家看望我的家人，同时招募新兵。事情进行得很顺利，休假结束时，有25到30人自愿入伍。有个年轻人想入伍，可他父亲坚决不同意，我费了好大劲才把他招募进来。这个父亲之所以不同意，仅仅是因为剥玉米的活儿还没完成，他儿子海勒姆得留下来干活儿。而最终使这个父亲同意的唯一原因是政府奖金。每个参军的人都会得到1000美元奖金，海勒姆许诺将这些钱全部交给他父亲。所以，老扎克说如果我把钱给他，再帮他剥玉米，他就同意。</td>
		<td class="en">In ’63 I went home on 30 days’ furlough to see my people, also to get recruits.I was quite successful, and by the time my furlough was up, had found between 25 and 30 men who were willing to enlist.There was one young man I had tried hard to get, and though he was willing, his father stubbornly refused to let him go.The only reason he had for refusing was that corn-husking was not yet over and his son Hiram was needed for the work.The only reason which finally caused him to give his consent was the bounty.They were offering a thousand dollars for every man who would join the army, and Hiram promised to turn every cent of it over to his father.So old Zack said he would agree if I would turn in and help with the husking.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我30天的休假已经结束了，但当时我很年轻，做事轻率，没把这事放在心上。我知道其他的新兵希望剥完玉米后再走，而且，我想我带着30个健壮的年轻人回团，就不会有什么事的。于是，我帮忙给老扎克家剥玉米，两周之后，玉米剥完了，我也准备出发了。</td>
		<td class="en">My 30 days’ furlough was up, but I was young and thoughtless in those days, and paid no heed to it.I knew the other recruits wished to stay till after corn-husking, and besides, felt that nothing would be done to me when I came back to my regiment with 30 stalwart lads.So I pitched in, and in two weeks all Old Zack’s corn was husked and I was ready to start.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们买了票，准备第二天早上从罗克岛坐火车去昆西。这些新兵将在昆西宣誓入伍，然后领取奖金，而这么多新兵入伍也会成为我们小镇的荣誉。但我的休假期超过了规定时间，这时我疏忽了一件事——宪兵司令。这些司令被人瞧不起，在人们眼里，他们连捕狗人都不如。他们的职责是抓捕逃兵，抓一个逃兵挣25美元，所以你可以看到，他们从不让一个机会溜走。假如他们只是抓真正的逃兵，人们也不会这么讨厌他们，但他们总是找那些善良诚实的士兵的麻烦，这些士兵的过错仅仅是有点儿疏忽，在家里呆得太久了。我们镇的宪兵司令很精明，像狮子一样勇敢，又很卑鄙，就像你在一整天的旅途中可能遇到的人一样。就在不久前，汤米·基格尔从我所在的团休假回家，他疏忽大意，超过了期限。第三天，就当他在罗克岛要登上火车返回部队的时候，戴维·麦格雷戈逮捕了他，把他押了回去。25美元的报酬以及花费都是从可怜的汤米的薪俸中扣除的，但汤米从未想过要逃跑。戴维·麦格雷戈不止这一次表现得这么卑鄙。</td>
		<td class="en">The tickets were bought, and the next morning we were ready to take the train at Rock Island for Quincy.There the men were to be sworn in and would receive their bounties, while our township would be credited with so many recruits.But in overstaying my furlough I had forgotten one thing—the provost marshal.These marshals were men who were looked down upon and despised worse than the dog-catchers.Their duty was to arrest deserters, and since their pay was $25 for every deserter captured, you can see they never let a chance slip.If they had only arrested real deserters, the people would not have dislike them so, but they were always bringing trouble upon good, honest soldiers whose only fault lay in being a little careless and staying too long at home.The provost marshal in our county was shrewd, brave as a lion, and as mean a man as one could meet in a whole day’s travel.Only a short time before, Tommy Jingles had come home from my regiment and thoughtlessly over-stayed his furlough.On the third day, just as he was boarding the train at Rock Island to go back to the army, Davy McGregor captured him and sent him back under arrest.The $25 reward and the expenses were taken from poor Tommy’s pay, and Tommy with never a thought of deserting.And this was not the only instance in which Davy McGregor had behaved so meanly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，先回到我的故事吧。那是我在家的最后一个晚上，我梦到了战争和一场场战斗。我被一大群散兵推着往前走。步枪咔咔的声音就像是在下冰雹，我们正猛攻第一前哨，就在这时我听到了响亮的敲门声，立刻醒了。“出来，西蒙，我要你出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">But to return to my story.It was my last night at home, and I was dreaming of war and battles.I had been thrown forward with a cloud of skirmishers.The musketry was rattling about like hail, and we were storming the first outpost, when I heard a loud rap at the door and was awake on the instant.“Come out, Simon, I want you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >是戴维在说话，我清楚地知道他为什么要我出去。但我没有应声，开始悄悄地穿衣服。很快，他的敲门声惊动了全家人。我刚穿好衣服，妹妹就溜进了我的房间。我低声告诉她要做什么。她走到门口和戴维讲话，但是没有开门。他开始怀疑了，我能听到他在房子周围蹑手蹑脚地走着，以便监视厨房的门。你瞧，他肯定我是在房子里的，而且认为我很有可能从厨房的门出去。我亲吻了父亲、母亲和妹妹，并让他们跟那些男孩们道别，随后，我小心地打开了前门。那晚有月光，我猜想戴维一直守在房子的后面。我手里提着鞋子，利用每一个隐蔽的地方，几乎连呼吸都不敢，慢慢地走到了牲口棚。我给父亲的大黑公马装上马鞍，一切准备就绪，我像炮弹一般离开了牲口棚。</td>
		<td class="en">It was Davy’s voice, and I well know what he wanted me for.I made no answer, however, and began to silently dress.His knocking soon roused the house, and by the time I was dressed my sister came slipping into the room.I told her in whispers what to do.She went to the door and talked with Davy, but would not open it.He became suspicious, and I could hear him creeping around the house so as to have an eye on the kitchen door.You see, he was certain I was in the house, and thought I would most likely come out that way.Kissing father and mother and sister, I asked them to say good-bye to the boys, and carefully opened the front door.It was moonlight, and Davy was, as I suspected, keeping watch at the rear of the house.With my shoes in my hand, taking advantage of every shadow and scarcely daring to breathe, I crawled to the barn.I saddled father’s big black stallion, and when all was ready, came out of the barn like a cannon shot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我骑着马飞快地在路上跑着，就在这时，戴维跑到路上拦住了我，我扳起了科尔特式手枪的扳机。他挡住我的路，要我停下来，还挥动着他的手枪。我径直冲他骑了过去，要不是他闪到一边，我肯定会把他撞倒，我离开后枪火在我左右闪动。我知道他会这么做，所以我躲到马的一边，但我动作不够快，因为一阵灼热的疼痛告诉我，他的第一颗子弹滑过了我头皮上的某个地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Davy ran to the road and halted me as I came up on the dead lope, my cocked Colt’s in my hand.He blocked my path, ordering me to halt and flourishing his pistols.On I came straight at him, and would surely have run him down, had he not sprung aside, blazing right and left at me as I went by.I knew he would do this, and ducked to the off-side of my horse, but not quickly enough, for a burning pain told me where his first bullet had plowed across my scalp.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >离罗克岛还有28英里，我像一阵风一样向前猛冲。骑马技术一向高超的戴维在后面紧追我。但我们的马不相上下。起初，他在我们转弯时用手枪射我，但很快他就不再射了。飞奔了数英里之后，我才开始确信我已经成功脱逃了，就在这时，我遇到了个意外。黎明破晓之际，我突然闯入了一片树林，里面还漆黑如夜。那里的路很泥泞，马蹄踏过去都没有声音。突然，在黑暗中，对面跃出一匹马和一个骑手。说时迟那时快，两匹马撞到了一起。陌生的马和骑手被猛地撞倒在地，而我伤得不严重。但父亲的公马很强壮。它晃了几下，呻吟了几声，然后跃起飞奔了出去。</td>
		<td class="en">On and away, with Rock Island 28 miles before me, I dashed like the wind.Davy, always well mounted, was hot after me.But our horses were evenly matched.At first he took flying shots at me as we rounded the bends, but he soon gave that up.Mile after mile flew by, and I was just beginning to feel sure of escape, when I met with an accident.Dawn was breaking as I plunged into a stretch of woods where it was yet as black as night.The road was heavy at that place, and the horse’s hoofs made no sound.Suddenly, out of the darkness and from the opposite direction, leaped a horse and rider.Too late to avoid the shock, our horses struck breast on.The strange steed and rider were hurled to the ground, while I was not badly hurt.But father’s stallion was strong.He shook himself, groaned, and sprang away on the gallop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可它还是受了重伤，我发现它正慢下来。戴维慢慢地赶上了我。不久他就跟我并行了，试图抓住我的缰绳。戴维手枪里的子弹已经用完了，所以他没法开枪打我。我一次次地用装了子弹的科尔特式手枪瞄准他，可他是一个勇猛的人，并不害怕。我不想开枪打他，但我想，与其让逃兵的耻辱之帽扣在我头上，倒不如开枪。你瞧，我没逃离部队，相反，我是要努力赶回部队——对一个真正的逃兵来说，这会是件滑稽的事情。但我没开枪，除非万不得已，否则我不打算用上我的左轮手枪。</td>
		<td class="en">Still he had been badly hurt, and I saw that he was losing his speed.Davy slowly overhauled me.Soon he was alongside, trying to seize my rein.He had emptied his pistols, so could not shoot.Again and again I drew a bead on him with my loaded Colt’s, but he was a brave man, refusing to be frightened.I did not wish to shoot him, but I think I would have done it rather than have the disgrace of deserter put upon me.You see, instead of running away, I was trying to run back to the army—a funny thing for a real deserter to do.But I did not shoot, not intending to use my revolver unless I had to.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们并排飞奔了至少10或12英里。渐渐地，我的马筋疲力尽，它走刚才那1英里时，戴维不得不控制住他的马，不让它远离我。每次他试图抓住我的缰绳时，我都会用沉重的左轮手枪打他的手，他很快就放弃了。我感到公马撑不了多久了，我必须采取行动来摆脱不该有的耻辱。我现在是，而且一直是个性情温和的人，对不能说话的动物充满同情，但我这样做也是迫不得已。我用了一个在西部学会的把戏。这种把戏叫“擦伤”，经常用在野马身上。人们射击马，使子弹正好擦过马脖子的上部。但这并没有射伤马。这只是让马昏迷，几分钟后，马就能恢复原来的良好状态。</td>
		<td class="en">Then we galloped, side by side, for at least 10 or 12 miles.Little by little my horse gave out and the last mile he made, Davy had to hold his horse in to keep him from running away from me.Every time he tried to catch my bridle I struck at his hand with my heavy revolver, and he soon gave that up.I felt that the stallion could not last much longer, and know I must do something to escape unearned disgrace.Now I am and always was a mild man, full of pity for dumb animals, but necessity forced me to do what I did.I played a trick I had learned out west.It is called “creasing,” and is often used on wild horses.They shoot them so the bullet just grazes the top of the neck.But it does not hurt the horse.It just stuns him and in a few minutes he is as good as ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我极快地探出马鞍，把左轮手枪的枪口对准戴维的马的颈背，然后开了枪。它猛地跌倒了，把戴维从头顶甩了出去。但戴维立刻站了起来，我可怜的马几乎不能甩掉他，他在后面跑着追赶我。</td>
		<td class="en">Quick as a flash I leaned out of the saddle, placed the muzzle of my revolver on the nape of the neck of Davy’s horse, and pulled the trigger.Down he went with a crash, throwing Davy over his head.Yet Davy was on his feet instantly, and my poor horse could barely keep away from him as he ran after me on foot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我看了下表。我能赶上第一趟列车，罗克岛就只有5英里远了。我的马跑不了5英里了，我不知所措。可是戴维让我想到了办法。到了路的拐角处时，我差点撞到一个进城农民的四轮马车。离这儿不到20英尺远，另一辆四轮马车也在朝同一个方向行进。戴维拦住了第一辆四轮马车，他开始抄近路——这就是他让我想到的办法。我拦住了第二辆四轮马车，驾车的是个女人，我也同样跟她解释了一下。她完全了解宪兵司令，所以很愿意帮我。我们讲好了，同时上了马，我领先20英尺。但幸运之神似乎更青睐戴维，因为他的马更好一些。但他忘了抄近路，尽管路很短，而且他的马跑在路上时摔倒了。</td>
		<td class="en">I looked at my watch.I could catch the first train, and Rock Island was only five miles away.My horse could not make those five miles and I did not know what to do.Davy gave me the idea, however.Coming around a turn in the road, I barely missed running into a farmer’s wagon going to town.Not 20 feet away was another, going in the same direction.Davy stopped the first one and began to cut the traces—this was the idea.I halted the second one, which was driven by a woman, and explained as I did likewise.And she was willing for she know all about the provost marshal.We finished and mounted at the same time, with myself 20 feet in the lead.Yet fortune seemed to favor him, for his horse was a little the better of the two.But he had neglected to cut the traces quite short though, and the horse, stepping upon them, was thrown.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这让我领先了几百英尺，我们到达罗克岛时，我还领先几个马身的距离。我们真是让这个城市吃惊啊！我们在大街上高声叫喊，而那些厌恶宪兵司令的人们都冲着我欢呼。我们险些遇到一些冲突，之后飞奔到火车站，火车正要开动。我骑着马，尽可能快地穿过人群，然后我下了马，向台阶冲去。你可以想象，人们是如何给一个没戴帽子、狂奔不止的士兵让路的，他手里还挥舞着巨大的左轮手枪。</td>
		<td class="en">This gave me several hundred feet, and I was still leading by several lengths when we entered Rock Island.How we startled the city!Down the main street we thundered, while the people, who all hated the provost marshal, cheered me on.We barely missed a dozen collisions, and galloped into the depot, where the train was just ready to start.I rode through the crowd as far as I dared; then dismounted and made a dash for the steps.You can guess how the people gave room for a wild hatless soldier, flourishing a huge revolver.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戴维锲而不舍地在后面紧紧追赶着，我不得不转过身去，用手枪逼退他。枪里没有上子弹，但戴维并不知道。我后退着离开他，威胁他说假如他碰我，我就开枪。人们开始支持我，哄笑着嘲弄这个宪兵司令。“士兵万岁！”他们喊道，“打倒宪兵司令！”“开枪打他，士兵，打他！”“谁逮捕了可怜的汤米·基格尔？”“戴维·麦格雷戈，你这个黑心的宪兵！”“穿蓝衣服的男孩万岁！”</td>
		<td class="en">Persevering Davy was right behind, and I had to face about and keep him off with my pistol.It was not loaded, but he did not know that.I backed away from him, threatening to pull the trigger if he laid hand on me.The crowd began to take my part, and to hoot and jeer the provost marshal.“Hurrah for the soldier!” they cried.“Down with the provost marshal!”“Shoot him, soldier, shoot him!”“Who arrested poor Tommy Jingles?”“Davy McGregor, the black-hearted provost.”“Hurrah for the boy in blue!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们一直这样喊着，还挡住了戴维的路，来回推搡他。之后，人们开始粗暴地对待他，我退到站台的台阶上时，他们正在踩他的脚趾，拽他的上衣后摆，像玩足球一样折磨他。列车员发出开车信号，在人们的最后一声欢呼中，火车驶出车站奔向昆西。那天晚些时候，我到了昆西，与招募的新兵会合。我把那些健壮的小伙子带回了团里，还把发生的一切告诉了上校。上校说：“干得好，西蒙，既然这样，我想你完全可以再休一次假。”</td>
		<td class="en">So they kept it up, getting in his way and pushing and shoving him about.Then they became rough, and as I backed up the steps to the platform, they were stepping on his toes, pulling his coat-tails and twisting him about like a football.The conductor gave the signal, and with a last cheer from the crowd, the train pulled out for Quincy.There I met my recruits later in the day.And when I brought my sturdy lads into the regiment and told all about it, the colonel said, “Well done, Simon, and at this rate I think you have well earned a second leave of absence.”</td></tr>
