		<td class="en">by O. Henry</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >窃贼迅速地爬进窗户里，然后不慌不忙地干了起来。每个敬重自己手艺的窃贼在拿东西之前总是不慌不忙的。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar stepped inside the window quickly, and then he took his time.A burglar who respects his art always takes his time before taking anything else.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这所房子是座私人住宅。从它的木板前门和不加修整的爬山虎来看，窃贼就知道这户的女主人正坐在海滨广场上，向一个戴着游艇帽的富有同情心的男士讲述，从未有人理解她那颗敏感孤独的心。从三楼前窗透出的灯光和这晚夏的季节来看，他知道，这户的男主人到家了，等会儿将会关灯睡觉。正因为这是一年中的九月份，也是心灵的秋天，这个季节，这间房子里的好男人该把楼顶的花园和女速记员视为无物，热烈地期盼他另一半的归来，祈祷较长久的正派得体和品德高尚的生活。</td>
		<td class="en">The house was a private residence.By its boarded front door and untrimmed Boston ivy the burglar knew that the mistress of it was sitting on some oceanside piazza telling a sympathetic man in a yachting cap that no one had ever understood her sensitive, lonely heart.He knew by the light in the third-story front windows, and by the lateness of the season, that the master of the house had come home, and would soon extinguish his light and retire.For it was September of the year and of the soul, in which season the house’s good man comes to consider roof gardens and stenographers as vanities, and to desire the return of his mate and the more durable blessings of decorum and the moral excellencies.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >窃贼点了支烟。用手护住的火柴发出的光，这一举动就立刻阐明了他的特点。他属于第三种窃贼。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar lighted a cigarette.The guarded glow of the match illuminated his salient points for a moment.He belonged to the third type of burglars.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第三类窃贼尚不为人熟知和接受。警察已经让我们熟知第一类和第二类窃贼。区别他们十分简单。衣领就是显著的标志。</td>
		<td class="en">This third type has not yet been recognized and accepted.The police have made us familiar with the first and second.Their classification is simple.The collar is the distinguishing mark.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个窃贼被捕时，如果没戴着硬领的话，他就被认为是堕落到最低级的败类，丧心病狂、极为邪恶，被看作是1878年从亨尼西警官口袋里偷得手铐并逃之夭夭、逍遥法外、无法无天的匪类。</td>
		<td class="en">When a burglar is caught who does not wear a collar he is described as a degenerate of the lowest type, singularly vicious and depraved, and is suspected of being the desperate criminal who stole the handcuffs out of Patrolman Hennessy’s pocket in 1878 and walked away to escape arrest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >另一类众所周知的就是带硬领的窃贼。他这类总是被人认为是现实中的拉弗尔斯式的人物。白天，他总是摆出一副绅士风度，连吃早餐都穿着正装，假装裱糊匠的样子。一到晚上，他就干起罪恶的窃贼营生。他妈妈相当富有，还是海林有名望的居民，当他被送进牢房时，他会立刻要一把指甲锉和一份《警察宪报》。他在联邦的每个州都有一个妻子，在每个准州都有一位未婚妻，报纸从她们的剪报资料里刊登了他配偶的照片，那些被五名医生宣布都无药可治的妇女在服用一瓶药后痊愈，并且第一次服用就相当见效。</td>
		<td class="en">The other well-known type is the burglar who wears a collar.He is always referred to as a Raffles in real life.He is invariably a gentleman by daylight, breakfasting in a dress suit, and posing as a paperhanger, while after dark he plies his nefarious occupation of burglary.His mother is an extremely wealthy and respected resident of Ocean Grove, and when he is conducted to his cell he asks at once for a nail file and the Police Gazette.He always has a wife in every State in the Union and fiancées in all the Territories, and the newspapers print his matrimonial gallery out of their stock of cuts of the ladies who were cured by only one bottle after having been given up by five doctors, experiencing great relief after the first dose.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >窃贼穿了件蓝色毛衣。他既不是一个拉弗尔斯，也不是《地狱厨房》的厨师。警察如果试着给他归类的话，会很困惑。一个不仅正派而且低调，并且谦逊的表现与其社会地位十分相符的窃贼，是他们闻所未闻的。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar wore a blue sweater.He was neither a Raffles nor one of the chefs from Hell’s Kitchen.The police would have been baffled had they attempted to classify him.They have not yet heard of the respectable, unassuming burglar who is neither above nor below his station.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个第三类窃贼开始在暗中来回寻觅。他没戴面具，不用暗灯，也没穿胶鞋。他口袋里揣着一把三八口径的左轮枪，若有所思地嚼着薄荷味口香糖。</td>
		<td class="en">This burglar of the third class began to prowl.He wore no masks, dark lanterns, or gum shoes.He carried a 38-calibre revolver in his pocket, and he chewed peppermint gum thoughtfully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >房间里的家具都罩着夏日防尘罩。银器放在远处的保险库里。他并不指望着有什么“意外收获”。他的目标是那间灯光昏暗的房间，里头的男主人在寂寞生活得到舒缓和安慰后一定沉入了梦乡。在那里可以“顺手牵羊”，凭着专业技能捞得一笔合情合理的好处：闲散的现金、一块手表、一条镶着珠宝的领带夹——全在法理之内。他发现窗子虚掩着，便抓住这个机会。</td>
		<td class="en">The furniture of the house was swathed in its summer dust protectors.The silver was far away in safe-deposit vaults.The burglar expected no remarkable “haul”.His objective point was that dimly lighted room where the master of the house should be sleeping heavily after whatever solace he had sought to lighten the burden of his loneliness.A “touch” might be made there to the extent of legitimate, fair professional profits—loose money, a watch, a jewelled stick-pin—nothing exorbitant or beyond reason.He had seen the window left open and had taken the chance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他轻轻打开那间亮着灯的房间的门。煤气灯的火苗点得很小。床上睡着一个男人。梳妆台上乱七八糟地散着许多东西——一卷皱巴巴的钞票、一块手表、钥匙、三块赌牌的筹码、压扁的雪茄、一条粉色丝绸发带，还有一瓶应该是为明早提神准备的没打开的溴化矿泉水。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar softly opened the door of the lighted room.The gas was turned low.A man lay in the bed asleep.On the dresser lay many things in confusion—a crumpled roll of bills, a watch, keys, three poker chips, crushed cigars, a pink silk hair bow, and an unopened bottle of bromo-seltzer for a bulwark in the morning.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >窃贼向梳妆台挪了三步。床上的人突然发出阵阵短促的呻吟声，并睁开了眼睛。他的右手伸到枕头下，却停在那里不动了。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar took three steps toward the dresser.The man in the bed suddenly uttered a squeaky groan and opened his eyes.His right hand slid under his pillow, but remained there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“躺着别动。”窃贼用平时聊天的语气说。第三类小偷从不压着嗓子说话。床上的人看到窃贼手里圆圆的枪口，便躺着不动了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Lay still,” said the burglar in conversational tone.Burglars of the third type do not hiss.The citizen in the bed looked at the round end of the burglar’s pistol and lay still.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，把两只手都举起来。”窃贼命令道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now hold up both your hands,” commanded the burglar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位公民留着两撇尖尖的、褐灰色的小山羊胡，看起来像是一位无痛拔牙的牙医。他看起来结实、受人敬重、急躁易怒、愤慨。他从床上坐了起来，把右手举过头顶。</td>
		<td class="en">The citizen had a little, pointed, brown-and-gray beard, like that of a painless dentist.He looked solid, esteemed, irritable, and disgusted.He sat up in bed and raised his right hand above his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“另一只也举起来，”窃贼命令道，“你可能两只手都很灵活，会用左手开枪。你懂“双手”的意思，对吧？现在，快点儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Up with the other one,” ordered the burglar.“You might be amphibious and shoot with your left.You can count two, can’t you?Hurry up, now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“另一只手举不起来啊。”公民说道，面部扭曲。</td>
		<td class="en">“Can’t raise the other one,” said the citizen, with a contortion of his lineaments.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它怎么了？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s the matter with it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“肩膀患风湿了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rheumatism in the shoulder.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“发炎吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Inflammatory?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“以前发炎。现在炎症向下扩散了。”窃贼站了一会儿，枪口依然指着那个痛苦的家伙。他朝梳妆台上的财物看了一眼，又十分窘迫地回头看了看床上的公民。接着，他又突然做了个鬼脸。</td>
		<td class="en">“Was.The inflammation has gone down.”The burglar stood for a moment or two, holding his gun on the afflicted one.He glanced at the plunder on the dresser and then, with a half-embarrassed air, back at the man in the bed.Then he, too, made a sudden grimace.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别站在那儿做鬼脸，”公民气急败坏地厉声责骂道，“你不是来打劫的吗，为什么还不动手？这里还放着一些东西。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t stand there making faces,” snapped the citizen, bad-humouredly.“If you’ve come to burgle why don’t you do it?There’s some stuff lying around.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“抱歉，”窃贼咧嘴笑着说，“但刚才我也犯病了。得了风湿算你我走运，我们碰巧是老病友啦。我也是左臂患风湿。要是换成别人的话，看你不举起那左手，早就朝你开枪了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Scuse me,” said the burglar, with a grin; “but it just socked me one, too.It’s good for you that rheumatism and me happens to be old pals.I got it in my left arm, too.Most anybody but me would have popped you when you wouldn’t hoist that left claw of yours.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你患风湿多久了？”公民询问。</td>
		<td class="en">“How long have you had it?” inquired the citizen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“四年了。我猜还不止。一旦你患上风湿，一辈子就得和它作伴——这是我的看法。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Four years.I guess that ain’t all.Once you’ve got it, it’s you for a rheumatic life—that’s my judgment.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“试过响尾蛇油吗？”公民饶有兴趣地问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ever try rattlesnake oil?” asked the citizen, interestedly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“几加仑了，”窃贼答道，“要是把我用过来炼油的所有蛇展开串在一起，那长度能有从地球到土星走四个来回。蛇的响声能传到印第安纳州的瓦尔帕莱索城，然后再传回来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Gallons,” said the burglar.“If all the snakes I’ve used the oil of was strung out in a row they’d reach eight times as far as Saturn, and the rattles could be heard at Valparaiso, Indiana, and back.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有人用契塞勒姆药丸。”公民说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Some use Chiselum’s Pills,” remarked the citizen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“骗人玩意儿！”窃贼说，“这药丸我用了五个月。根本没见效。那一年，我用了芬克汉姆的浸膏，敷着吉利德的镇痛膏，还喷着帕特的止痛喷雾，症状才有所缓解；但我认为真正起作用的是我放在口袋里的七叶树叶。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Fudge!” said the burglar.“Took ’em five months.No good.I had some relief the year I tried Finkelham’s Extract, Balm of Gilead poultices and Potts’s Pain Pulverizer; but I think it was the buckeye I carried in my pocket what done the trick.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你早晚会痛得更厉害吗？”公民问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is yours worse in the morning or at night?” asked the citizen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“晚上，”窃贼说，“正好是我最忙的时候。哎，你把那只手放下来吧——我寻思你还不至于——嘿，你试过伯里格斯塔夫补血丸没？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Night,” said the burglar; “just when I’m busiest.Say, take down that arm of yours—I guess you won’t—Say! did you ever try Blickerstaff’s Blood Builder?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从来没有。你这风湿痛是一阵阵的，还是持续的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I never did.Does yours come in paroxysms or is it a steady pain?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >窃贼在床尾坐下，把枪放着交叉着的膝盖上。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar sat down on the foot of the bed and rested his gun on his crossed knee.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它发作不定，”他说。“总在我没料到的时候犯病。我不得不放弃二楼的活，因为时不时到一半的时候就疼得动不了了。告诉你——我不相信那帮庸医知道怎么治这病。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It jumps,” said he.“It strikes me when I ain’t looking for it.I had to give up second-story work because I got stuck sometimes half-way up.Tell you what—I don’t believe the bloomin’ doctors know what is good for it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也这样认为。我花的一千美金全部打了水漂，根本没见效。你得病的地方会肿吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Same here.I’ve spent a thousand dollars without getting any relief.Yours swell any?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上会。要是哪天要下雨的话——我的老天！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Of mornings.And when it’s goin’ to rain—great Christopher!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也是，”公民说，“有一块桌布大小的湿气从佛罗里达飘向纽约时，我都能感觉到。如果我恰好经过一座正在上演午场《鸳梦重温》的剧院，观众泪水的潮气都会让我的左臂像牙疼一样刺痛。”  </td>
		<td class="en">“Me, too,” said the citizen.“I can tell when a streak of humidity the size of a table-cloth starts from Florida on its way to New York.And if I pass a theatre where there’s an ‘East Lynne’ matinee going on, the moisture starts my left arm jumping like a toothache.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“疼痛一点儿不会减轻——他妈的！”窃贼说。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s undiluted—hades!” said the burglar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你说得太对了。”公民说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re dead right,” said the citizen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >窃贼低头看了看他的手枪，尴尬地装出一副随意的样子把它装进了口袋。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar looked down at his pistol and thrust it into his pocket with an awkward attempt at ease.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喂，老兄，”他不自然地问，“有没有试过肥皂樟脑搽剂？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Say, old man,” he said, constrainedly, “ever try opodeldoc?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“烂货！”公民愤怒地叫道，“和搽餐馆里的黄油没什么两样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Slop!” said the citizen angrily.“Might as well rub on restaurant butter.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就是，”窃贼应和道，“简直就是给被小猫挠破手指头的小姑娘用的药膏。我跟你说！我们对它束手无策。但是我发现只有一样东西能够缓解这个病。你猜是什么？一些活血通经、延年益寿的老酒。喂——这件事就算啦——抱歉——穿上你的衣服，我们出去喝点吧。原谅我的失礼，但是——哎哟！又犯病了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sure,” concurred the burglar.“It’s a salve suitable for little Minnie when the kitty scratches her finger.I’ll tell you what!We’re up against it.I only find one thing that eases her up.Hey?Little old sanitary, ameliorating, lest-we-forget Booze.Say—this job’s off—’scuse me—get on your clothes and let’s go out and have some.’Scuse the liberty, but—ouch!There she goes again!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一周了，”公民说，“没人帮忙的话，我都没法穿衣服。恐怕托马斯已经睡下了，而且——”</td>
		<td class="en">“For a week,” said the citizen.“I haven’t been able to dress myself without help.I’m afraid Thomas is in bed, and—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“起来，”窃贼说，“我来帮你套上衣服。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Climb out,” said the burglar, “I’ll help you get into your duds.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >理智像潮水一样返回来，涌上公民的心头。他摸了摸他灰褐色的胡子。</td>
		<td class="en">The conventional returned as a tidal wave and flooded the citizen.He stroked his brown-and-gray beard.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这也太奇怪了——”他开口道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s very unusual—” he began.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“给你衬衣，”窃贼说，“起来。我认识的一个家伙说他用了奥贝利的软膏，两周就痊愈了，结果他都能用双手打活结领带了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here’s your shirt,” said the burglar, “fall out.I knew a man who said Omberry’s Ointment fixed him in two weeks so he could use both hands in tying his four-in-hand.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们刚一出门，公民转身就要回去。</td>
		<td class="en">As they were going out the door the citizen turned and started back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好像我忘记带钱了，”公民解释道，“昨晚我把它放在梳妆台上了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“’Liked to forgot my money,” he explained; “laid it on the dresser last night.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >窃贼拽住他右臂的袖子。</td>
		<td class="en">The burglar caught him by the right sleeve.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来吧，”窃贼爽快地说，“我邀请你。别取了。我来付钱。试过金缕梅酊剂和冬青油没？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come on,” he said bluffly.“I ask you.Leave it alone.I’ve got the price.Ever try witch hazel and oil of wintergreen?”</td></tr>
