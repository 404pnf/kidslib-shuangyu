		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我小的时候，叔叔和他大些的儿子们用步枪打猎，他最小的儿子弗雷德和我用滑膛枪——一种单管的猎枪，完全适合我们的身高和力气；这枪比扫帚重不了多少。我俩换着用，每人半小时。</td>
		<td class="en">When I was a boy my uncle and his big boys hunted with the rifle, the youngest boy Fred and I with a shotgun—a small single-barrelled shotgun which was properly suited to our size and strength; it was not much  heavier than a broom.We carried it turn about, half an hour at a time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我用那支枪什么都没打中过，但是我喜欢尝试。我和弗雷德打长着羽毛的小猎物，其他人打鹿、松鼠、野火鸡这样的东西。叔叔和他大些的儿子都是神枪手。</td>
		<td class="en">I was not able to hit anything with it, but I liked to try.Fred and I hunted feathered small game, the others hunted deer, squirrels, wild turkeys, and such things.My uncle and the big boys were good shots.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们猎杀老鹰、野鹅这种飞禽；他们不去伤害或猎杀松鼠，只把它们震昏。猎狗群追赶一只松鼠上树，松鼠就会慌慌张张地一个劲儿往高处跑，跑到一根树枝上，紧紧压在树枝上，希望用这种方式让人看不见它——但往往不太成功。你能看见它竖着小巧又可爱的耳朵。</td>
		<td class="en">They killed hawks and wild geese and such like on the wing; and they didn’t wound or kill squirrels, they stunned them.When the dogs treed a squirrel, the squirrel would scamper aloft and run out on a limb and flatten himself along it, hoping to make himself invisible in that way— and not quite succeeding.You could see his wee little ears sticking up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你看不到它的鼻子，但你知道它在哪里。这时，猎人不屑给步枪“休息”时间，站起来稍稍瞄准树枝，一颗子弹立即射了出来，正中松鼠鼻子下面的树枝。小动物从上面摔了下来，没受伤，但没了知觉；猎狗摇晃它一下就死了。有时候，由于距离实在太远，或者猎手没有精确地考虑到风速的影响，子弹会击中松鼠的脑袋；这样的话，猎狗就可以对这只死松鼠为所欲为了——因为猎手的自豪感受挫，他不会把它放进自己的猎物袋中。</td>
		<td class="en">You couldn’t see his nose, but you knew where it was.Then the hunter, despising a “rest” for his rifle, stood up and took offhand aim at the limb and sent a bullet into it immediately under the squirrel’s nose, and down tumbled the animal, unwounded, but unconscious; the dogs gave him a shake and he was dead.Sometimes when the distance was great and the wind not accurately allowed for, the bullet would hit the squirrel’s head; the dogs could do as they pleased with that one—the hunter’s pride was hurt, and he wouldn’t allow it to go into the gamebag.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >迎着晨曦第一缕昏暗的晨光，大批威武的野火鸡就开始集结整齐，准备参与社交活动，回应即将来临的邀请，并与其他同类旅行者交流。</td>
		<td class="en">In the first faint gray of the dawn the stately wild turkeys would be stalking around in great flocks, and ready to be sociable and answer invitations to come and converse with other excursionists of their kind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >猎手将自己掩藏起来，用一只火鸡的腿骨吸气来模拟火鸡的叫声，这只火鸡就是之前听到这样的叫声回应了一下，结果它死前就只剩下后悔了。再没有其他材料比这根腿骨更适合制作一只完美的火鸡哨了。你看，又一例大自然的背叛行为。大自然中，这种行为无所不在；半数情况下是因为它不知道更偏爱哪一种——是背叛它的孩子，还是保护它。在火鸡这件事上，大自然完全弄糊涂了：它赐给了火鸡一根能为人利用，使它大难临头的骨头，同时又赐给了它一种能使它摆脱麻烦的花招。当一只火鸡妈妈回应了邀请，又发现接受这个邀请是个错误时，它就会像鹧鸪妈妈那样——回忆起先前的一次遭遇——一瘸一拐仓促逃离，假装瘸得很厉害；同时，它对那些没有被发现的孩子们说：“藏低一些，别动，不要暴露自己，等我把这个卑鄙的骗子引诱出去就回来。”</td>
		<td class="en">The hunter concealed himself and imitated the turkey-call by sucking the air through the leg-bone of a turkey which had previously answered a call like that and lived only just long enough to regret it.There is nothing that furnishes a perfect turkey-call except that bone.Another of Nature’s treacheries, you see.She is full of them; half the time she doesn’t know which she likes best—to betray her child or protect it.In the case of the turkey she is badly mixed: she gives it a bone to be used in getting it into trouble, and she also furnishes it with a trick for getting itself out of the trouble again.When a mamma-turkey answers an invitation and finds she has made a mistake in accepting it, she does as the mamma-partridge does—remembers a previous engagement—and goes limping and scrambling away, pretending to be very lame; and at the same time she is saying to her not-visible children, “Lie low, keep still, don’t expose yourselves; I shall be back as soon as I have beguiled this shabby swindler out of the country.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果一个人对此一无所知，轻信了，那么这个邪恶的小伎俩一定会累垮他。有天早晨，我尾随一个假装腿瘸的火鸡，跑遍了大半个美国，因为我相信它，认为它绝不会欺骗一个信任它、认为它诚实的小男孩。我握着一支单管滑膛枪，但我的想法是活捉它。我常常离它很近，只要一扑就能抓到它。于是，我就扑了上去，但总是就在我最后一冲要把手放到它的背部原来停留的位置时，它却不在那里了。它离那里只有两三英寸远，我腹部着地时扫到了它尾巴上的毛——非常近的距离，但还不够近，也就是说，距离还没近到能让我成功抓住它，而只是近到让我确信下次能抓住它。它总是在等着我，在离我只有一丁点儿远的地方，并装出一副要休息了，累垮了的样子。这是个假象，但我相信了，因为我还是认为它很诚实。我本应该早就开始怀疑它的，我只是觉得像它这么一只高傲的鸟绝不可能演戏。我就跟着，跟着，跟着，时不时猛扑几下，再站起来，掸掉身上的灰尘，然后怀着耐心和信心继续跟下去。的确，我的信心在不断增强，因为我通过气候和植被的变化看出，我们在不断地向高纬度地区行进。我每次猛扑上去之后，由于它总是看上去愈来愈累，愈来愈沮丧，因此我断定我会取胜。最后，这场竞技纯粹变成了一个耗费耐力的活儿，而从一开始我就占上风，因为它是个瘸子。</td>
		<td class="en">When a person is ignorant and confiding, this immoral device can have tiresome results.I followed an ostensibly lame turkey over a considerable part of the United States one morning, because I believed in her and could not think she would deceive a mere boy, and one who was trusting her and considering her honest.I had the single-barrelled shotgun, but my idea was to catch her alive.I often got within rushing distance of her, and then made my rush; but always, just as I made my final plunge and put my hand down where her back had been, it wasn’t there; it was only two or three inches from there and I brushed the tail-feathers as I landed on my stomach—a very close call, but still not quite close enough; that is, not close enough for success, but just close enough to convince me that I could do it next time.She always waited for me, a little piece away, and let on to be resting and greatly fatigued; which was a lie, but I believed it, for I still thought her honest long after I ought to have begun to doubt her, suspecting that this was no way for a high-minded bird to be acting.I followed, and followed, and followed, making my periodical rushes, and getting up and brushing the dust off, and resuming the voyage with patient confidence; indeed, with a confidence which grew, for I could see by the change of climate and vegetation that we were getting up into the high latitudes, and as she always looked a little tireder and a little more discouraged after each rush, I judged that I was safe to win, in the end, the competition being purely a matter of staying power and the advantage lying with me from the start because she was lame.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一直到下午到时候，我自己都开始感到疲惫了。从十多个小时前我们开始远足到现在，谁也没有休息片刻。虽然最近每次猛扑之后，我们都会稍微停一会儿，我假装在想其他的事情，但我们两个都不诚实，都在等对方先开战，都不真正急于动手，因为我们的确都很珍惜这稍纵即逝的休息时间。这很自然，我们从天亮就开始像这样一直打打停停，在此期间没吃一点儿东西。至少我是这样，不过它有时侧躺扇着翅膀，祈祷上帝赐予其力量摆脱困境时，一只死期将至的蚱蜢刚好经过，这对火鸡来说可真是有利又幸运，但我什么也没吃——整整一天什么也没吃。</td>
		<td class="en">Along in the afternoon I began to feel fatigued myself.Neither of us had had any rest since we first started on the excursion, which was upwards of ten hours before, though latterly we had paused awhile after rushes, I letting on to be thinking about something else; but neither of us sincere, and both of us waiting for the other to call game but in no real hurry about it, for indeed those little evanescent snatches of rest were very grateful to the feelings of us both; it would naturally be so, skirmishing along like that ever since dawn and not a bite in the meantime; at least for me, though sometimes as she lay on her side fanning herself with a wing and praying for strength to get out of this difficulty a grasshopper happened along whose time had come, and that was well for her, and fortunate, but I had nothing—nothing the whole day.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不止一次，在我累得不行的时候，我就想放弃活捉这只火鸡的念头，并打算开枪毙了它。但我从没这样做，虽然这是我的权利，原因是我相信我射不到它。而且，我每次举起枪时，它总是停下来摆好姿势，这让我怀疑它了解我和我的枪法。因此，我不在乎让自己成为众人议论的对象。</td>
		<td class="en">More than once, after I was very tired, I gave up taking her alive, and was going to shoot her, but I never did it, although it was my right, for I did not believe I could hit her; and besides, she always stopped and posed, when I raised the gun, and this made me suspicious that she knew about me and my marksmanship, and so I did not care to expose myself to remarks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我根本没抓着它。最后，它厌倦了这场游戏，几乎是从我的手底下飞了起来，像颗炮弹似的呼呼地往上蹿，飞得高高的，落到一棵大树的最高树枝上坐了下来，双腿交叉，然后它冲着树下的我微笑，看到我如此吃惊，它似乎很满足。</td>
		<td class="en">I did not get her, at all.When she got tired of the game at last, she rose from almost under my hand and flew aloft with the rush and whir of a shell and lit on the highest limb of a great tree and sat down and crossed her legs and smiled down at me, and seemed gratified to see me so astonished.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我很惭愧，又迷了路。后来，在树林里乱逛找寻出路时，我发现了一个被遗弃的小木屋，在那里我吃到了一生中最可口的一顿饭。那个野草丛生的花园里，到处是熟透的西红柿。我狼吞虎咽地吃了一通，虽然我之前从来都不爱吃西红柿。我之后尝到的美食，只有两三次能与那些可口的西红柿相媲美。我那次吃伤了，在中年之前没再吃过一个西红柿。我现在可以吃西红柿了，但我并不喜欢它们的模样。我猜，我们都曾有过一两次这种吃伤了的经历。有一次，由于环境所困，手头实在没有别的可吃，我吃了大半桶的沙丁鱼，但自那以后，即便没有沙丁鱼，我也能熬过去。</td>
		<td class="en">I was ashamed, and also lost; and it was while wandering the woods hunting for myself that I found a deserted log cabin and had one of the best meals there that in my life-days I have eaten.The weed-grown garden was full of ripe tomatoes, and I ate them ravenously, though I had never liked them before.Not more than two or three times since have I tasted anything that was so delicious as those tomatoes.I surfeited myself with them, and did not taste another one until I was in middle life.I can eat them now, but I do not like the look of them.I suppose we have all experienced a surfeit at one time or another.Once, in stress of circumstances, I ate part of a barrel of sardines, there being nothing else at hand, but since then I have always been able to get along without sardines.</td></tr>
