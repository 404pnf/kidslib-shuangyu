		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >月台上到处是被火光照亮的黑脸庞，他在人群中转过身时，脸也被火光映得闪闪发光。在炉火的映照下，她瞥见了他晃动着的面孔，像一团漂浮的火苗。怀旧的情结和归乡的宿命像麻醉剂一样侵袭着她全身的血管。他那张一成不变的脸，此刻被火光照亮了！熊熊的炉火发出的摇曳而幽暗的红色火光直入云霄，照亮了这座小车站上那群乱哄哄的工人，照亮了他，然后熄灭了。</td>
		<td class="en">Flame-lurid his face as he turned among the throng of flame-lit and dark faces upon the platform.In the light of the furnace she caught sight of his drifting countenance, like a piece of floating fire.And the nostalgia, the doom of homecoming went through her veins like a drug.His eternal face, flame-lit now!The pulse and darkness of red fire from the furnace towers in the sky, lighting the desultory, industrial crowd on the wayside station, lit him and went out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，他没有看到她。他被火光照着，所以没有看见！他总是那个样子：眉毛快连到一起，头上戴着那顶普通的帽子，脖子上围着条红黑相间的围巾，还打了个结。出来见她，甚至连硬领也不戴！火焰已经灭了，四下里一片漆黑。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course he did not see her.Flame-lit and unseeing!Always the same, with his meeting eyebrows, his common cap, and his red-and-black scarf knotted round his throat.Not even a collar to meet her!The flames had sunk, there was shadow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她打开积满污垢的支线车厢门，开始往下拿包。当然，哪儿都找不到行李搬运工，但是有哈里——他隐约闪现在一小群人的外边，自然没看到她。</td>
		<td class="en">She opened the door of her grimy, branch-line carriage, and began to get down her bags.The porter was nowhere, of course, but there was Harry, obscure, on the outer edge of the little crowd, missing her, of course.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在这儿！哈里！”她叫道，在昏暗的光线中挥动着她的伞。他连忙跑上前来。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Here!Harry!’ she called, waving her umbrella in the twilight.He hurried forward.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你回来啦？”他说，高兴地迎接她。她下了车，有点儿慌张，匆匆地亲了他一下。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Tha’s come, has ter?’ he said, in a sort of cheerful welcome.She got down, rather flustered, and gave him a peck of a kiss.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有两只提箱！”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Two suit-cases!’ she said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他攀上车厢去拿她的手提包时，她的内心在痛苦呻吟。车站后面那只大火炉一下子又喷出火光，直冲昏暗的天空。她感到那通红的火焰掠过了她的脸庞。她回来了，她永远地回来了。她的内心郁郁不乐。她怀疑自己能否禁受得了。</td>
		<td class="en">Her soul groaned within her, as he clambered into the carriage after her bags.Up shot the fire in the twilight sky, from the great furnace behind the station.She felt the red flame go across her face.She had come back, she had come back for good.And her spirit groaned dismally.She doubted if she could bear it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她站在这个火光映照下的肮脏小站里，穿着精致的外套和裙子，戴着灰色的阔边丝绒帽，高挑而醒目。她戴着灰色的手套，手里拿着阳伞、珠子腰链和一只小皮箱，而哈里则提着她的包趔趔趄趄走下那列肮脏的小火车。</td>
		<td class="en">There, on the sordid little station under the furnaces, she stood, tall and distinguished, in her well-made coat and skirt and her broad grey velour hat.She held her umbrella, her bead chatelaine, and a little leather case in her grey-gloved hands, while Harry staggered out of the ugly little train with her bags.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“后面还有个大行李箱。”她欢快地说。但是，她并不觉得开心。铸铁厂那一对黑乎乎的烟囱喷出高高的火光，直入夜空。整个场景一片明亮。火车很乐意地等候着。它还会再等上十分钟。这一点她知道。一切都那么熟悉。</td>
		<td class="en">‘There’s a trunk at the back,’ she said in her bright voice.But she was not feeling bright.The twin black cones of the iron foundry blasted their sky-high fires into the night.The whole scene was lurid.The train waited cheerfully.It would wait another ten minutes.She knew it.It was all so deadly familiar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在我们赶紧交代一下吧。她是一位贵夫人的女仆，三十岁了，回家乡来和她的初恋，一个翻砂工人结婚——在这之前的十二三年中，她对他一直若即若离。她为什么回来呢？她爱他吗？不。她并没有假装爱他。她曾经爱上了她那才华横溢、满腔抱负的表兄，但他抛弃了她，而且现在已不在人世了。她另外还有过几桩风流韵事，后来也都无疾而终。所以她回来了，突然回来与她的初恋情人结婚——这么多年来，他一直等着她，或者说一直单身。</td>
		<td class="en">Let us confess it at once.She was a lady’s maid, thirty years old, come back to marry her first-love, a foundry worker, after having kept him dangling, off and on, for a dozen years.Why had she come back?Did she love him?No. She didn’t pretend to.She had loved her brilliant and ambitious cousin, who had jilted her, and who had died.She had had other affairs which had come to nothing.So here she was, come back suddenly to marry her first-love, who had waited—or remained single—all these years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当哈里以工人特有的大跨步走下月台，走向警卫的篷车的时候，她问道：“要不找个搬运工来搬这些行李？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Won’t a porter carry those?’ she said, as Harry strode with his workman’s stride down the platform towards the guard’s van.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我能行。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I can manage,’ he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是她拿着她的阳伞、腰链和小皮箱，跟在他后面。</td>
		<td class="en">And with her umbrella, her chatelaine, and her little leather case, she followed him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大行李箱在那儿。</td>
		<td class="en">The trunk was there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们请希瑟蔬菜水果店的运货马车帮忙捎一下吧。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘We’ll get Heather’s greengrocer’s cart to fetch it up,’ he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有出租马车吗？”范妮说，心里闷闷不乐，她很清楚这里并没有出租马车。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Isn’t there a cab?’ said Fanny, knowing dismally enough that there wasn’t.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我把它放在自动售货机旁，希瑟蔬菜水果店的车子会在八点半左右把它捎走。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I’ll just put it aside o’ the penny-in-the-slot, and Heather’s greengrocers’ll fetch it about half past eight,’ he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他抓着箱子的两只把手，拎着它蹒跚着走过交叉路口，他一路踉跄着，两腿不时撞在箱子上。随后，他把箱子搁在那架红色的糖果机旁边。</td>
		<td class="en">He seized the box by its two handles and staggered with it across the level-crossing, bumping his legs against it as he waddled.Then he dropped it by the red sweet-meats machine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“放在那儿安全吗？”她问道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Will it be safe there?’ she said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎——跟家里一样安全。”他回答道。他回去取了另两只包。这样他们手里都提满了东西，开始沿着铸铁厂那又长又黑的大厂房吃力地爬上小山。她走在他的旁边——他是个名副其实的工人，提着行李吃力地向前走。愈来愈深的暮色下闪起红红的火光。铸铁厂里传来可怕而又缓慢的哐，哐，哐的打铁声，巨大的噪音，中间的间歇长得叫人难以忍受。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Ay—safe as houses,’ he answered.He returned for the two bags.Thus laden, they started to plod up the hill, under the great long black building of the foundry.She walked beside him—workman of workmen he was, trudging with that luggage.The red lights flared over the deepening darkness.From the foundry came the horrible, slow clang, clang, clang of iron, a great noise, with an interval just long enough to make it unendurable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >与她到达格洛斯特的情况比较一下吧：女主人坐大马车，她则带着行李坐双轮轻便马车；过了河，车道旁有宜人的小树林；她坐在阿瑟的身旁，人人都对她彬彬有礼。</td>
		<td class="en">Compare this with the arrival at Gloucester: the carriage for her mistress, the dog-cart for herself with the luggage; the drive out past the river, the pleasant trees of the carriage-approach; and herself sitting beside Arthur, everybody so polite to her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她回家乡来了——永远地回来了！挨着这个满手行李的人，吃力地爬着这座没完没了、令人讨厌的小山，她的心跳几乎都要停止了。多么落魄啊！多么落魄啊！此时此景，她没法像往常一样欢欣愉悦。她对这一切太熟悉了。要是不寻常的情况，倒还容易承受，可这却是再也熟悉不过的乏味的过去！</td>
		<td class="en">She had come home—for good!Her heart nearly stopped beating as she trudged up that hideous and interminable hill, beside the laden figure.What a come-down!What a come-down!She could not take it with her usual bright cheerfulness.She knew it all too well.It is easy to bear up against the unusual, but the deadly familiarity of an old stale past!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把皮包放在一根路灯柱子下，想休息一会儿。两人就这样站在灯火下。路过的人都盯着她看，一边向哈里道晚安。他们几乎认不出她，她成了个外乡人。</td>
		<td class="en">He dumped the bags down under a lamp-post, for a rest.There they stood, the two of them, in the lamplight.Passers-by stared at her, and gave good-night to Harry.Her they hardly knew, she had become a stranger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“包太重了吧，我来提一只吧。”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘They’re too heavy for you, let me carry one,’ she said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“提着走了一英里，还真觉得有点沉呢。”他回答。</td>
		<td class="en">‘They begin to weigh a bit by the time you’ve gone a mile,’ he answered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我来拎那只小的吧。”她坚持说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Let me carry the little one,’ she insisted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真想提，那就提一会儿吧。”他说着，将小旅行包递了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Tha can ha’e it for a minute, if ter’s a mind,’ he said, handing over the valise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，他们来到了山顶上这座丑陋小城镇的街市。所有人都盯着她看，天哪，他们都怎样盯着她看啊！电影院才刚开始入场，所以队伍一直排到了大街转角的地方。大伙儿都仔细地打量着她。“晚上好，哈里！”那些家伙都饶有兴趣地喊着。</td>
		<td class="en">And thus they arrived in the streets of shops of the little ugly town on top of the hill.How everybody stared at her; my word, how they stared!And the cinema was just going in, and the queues were tailing down the road to the corner.And everybody took full stock of her.‘Night, Harry!’ shouted the fellows, in an interested voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，他们到了她婶婶的家——小街上的一家小糖果铺。“叮铃”，他们摁了一下门铃，她的婶婶就从厨房里跑了过来。</td>
		<td class="en">However, they arrived at her aunt’s—a little sweet-shop in a side street.They ‘pinged’ the door-bell, and her aunt came running forward out of the kitchen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你回来啦，孩子！我想你们一定很想喝杯茶吧。你还好吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘There you are, child!Dying for a cup of tea, I’m sure.How are you?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范妮的婶婶亲了亲她，范妮用尽全力才克制住自己，没有突然哭出来，她感到如此低落。也许，她是想喝茶。</td>
		<td class="en">Fanny’s aunt kissed her, and it was all Fanny could do to refrain from bursting into tears, she felt so low.Perhaps it was her tea she wanted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这行李把你累坏了吧。”范妮的婶婶对哈里说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You’ve had a drag with that luggage,’ said Fanny’s aunt to Harry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉——我很乐意能放下来，”他边说边望着自己的手，手上已经被包的把手勒出了印痕。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Ay—I’m not sorry to put it down,’ he said, looking at his hand which was crushed and cramped by the bag handle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着，他就出门去查看希瑟蔬菜水果铺的马车来没来。</td>
		<td class="en">Then he departed to see about Heather’s greengrocery cart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范妮坐下喝茶时，她的婶婶，这个头发花白、面容秀丽、身材娇小的女人，怀着赞赏的心境看着她，替她感到惋惜。因为范妮很美：身材高挑、笔直，肤色洁白，鼻子精致高挺，一头浓密的褐发，一双大而明亮的灰色眼睛。一个热情的女人——一个叫人害怕的女人。她是如此高傲，内心却又如此炽热！她出身于一个生性热情的家族。</td>
		<td class="en">When Fanny sat at tea, her aunt, a grey-haired, fair-faced little woman, looked at her with an admiring heart, feeling bitterly sore for her.For Fanny was beautiful: tall, erect, finely coloured, with her delicately arched nose, her rich brown hair, her large lustrous grey eyes.A passionate woman—a woman to be afraid of.So proud, so inwardly violent!She came of a violent race.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >需要有个女人来怜惜她。男人没有这样的勇气。可怜的范妮！她这么像一位大家闺秀，气质高雅，雍容华贵。可是，似乎一切都在跟她作对。这个俏丽而敏感的女人，总是带着一副紧张而又不自然的笑脸，似乎每次都注定要蒙受耻辱，伤心失望。</td>
		<td class="en">It needed a woman to sympathize with her.Men had not the courage.Poor Fanny!She was such a lady, and so straight and magnificent.And yet everything seemed to do her down.Every time she seemed to be doomed to humiliation and disappointment, this handsome, brilliantly sensitive woman, with her nervous, overwrought laugh.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你这次当真回来了吗，孩子？”婶婶说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘So you’ve really come back, child?’ said her aunt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真回来了，婶婶。”范妮说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I really have, Aunt,’ said Fanny.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可怜的哈里！你知道，我真没法确定你是不是在拿他寻开心。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Poor Harry!I’m not sure, you know, Fanny, that you’re not taking a bit of an advantage of him.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，婶婶，他已经等了这么久，也该等到他想要的一切了。”范妮苦笑了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, Aunt, he’s waited so long, he may as well have what he’s waited for.’Fanny laughed grimly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是呀，孩子，他等了这么久，我都不知道这样对他是不是太残忍了。范妮，你知道的，我很喜欢他，虽然你也明白，我并不认为他配得上你。而且，我认为他自己也是这么想的，可怜的人。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes, child, he’s waited so long, that I’m not sure it isn’t a bit hard on him.You know, I like him, Fanny—though as you know quite well, I don’t think he’s good enough for you.And I think he thinks so himself, poor fellow.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个您可别这么肯定，婶婶。哈里虽然普普通通，人却不谦卑。只要他对女方有意思，哪怕那是女王，他也不会认为是高攀。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Don’t you be so sure of that, Aunt.Harry is common, but he’s not humble.He wouldn’t think the Queen was any too good for him, if he’d a mind to her.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唔——要是他对自己有个恰当的看法，那倒还好。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well—It’s as well if he has a proper opinion of himself.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这得看您认为什么算是恰当，”范妮说，“不过他有他的优点——”</td>
		<td class="en">‘It depends what you call proper,’ said Fanny.‘But he’s got his good points—’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，他人挺好，我很喜欢他，我确实很喜欢他。只不过，就像我跟你说的，他配不上你。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, he’s a nice fellow, and I like him, I do like him.Only, as I tell you, he’s not good enough for you.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我已经打定主意啦，婶婶。”范妮苦笑着说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I’ve made up my mind, Aunt,’ said Fanny, grimly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是呀，”婶婶若有所思地说，“都说，精诚所至，金石为开——”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes,’ mused the aunt.‘They say all things come to him who waits—’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比他指望的还要多，是吧，婶婶？”范妮笑得很苦涩。</td>
		<td class="en">‘More than he’s bargained for, eh, Aunt?’ laughed Fanny rather bitterly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位可怜的婶婶，这苦涩的笑让她为自己的侄女感到了心酸。</td>
		<td class="en">The poor aunt, this bitterness grieved her for her niece.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们的谈话被店铺的门铃声打断了，接着听到哈里在喊：“是这里！”但是哈里没有立即进来，范妮大概一时又担心起他来，所以连忙站起身，走去铺子。她看见外边有一辆运货马车，于是走向门口。</td>
		<td class="en">They were interrupted by the ping of the shop-bell, and Harry’s call of ‘Right!’But as he did not come in at once, Fanny, feeling solicitous for him presumably at the moment, rose and went into the shop.She saw a cart outside, and went to the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >刚站到门口，她就听见一个女人粗鄙的谩骂声从街对面的黑暗中传了过来：</td>
		<td class="en">And the moment she stood in the doorway, she heard a woman’s common vituperative voice crying from the darkness of the opposite side of the road:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在这儿，是吧？我可要你好看，大老爷。我可要你好看，你等着瞧我敢不敢！”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Tha’rt theer, ar ter?I’ll shame thee, Mester.I’ll shame thee, see if I dunna.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >范妮吓了一跳，仔细朝对面的黑暗中望去，瞥见一个戴着黑色无边女帽的女人从一盏路灯下朝小街的那头走去。</td>
		<td class="en">Startled, Fanny stared across the darkness, and saw a woman in a black bonnet go under one of the lamps up the side street.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哈里和比尔·希瑟已经把那只大行李箱从小运货马车上拖下来。他们抬着箱子走上铺子外面的台阶，她连忙退到一旁。</td>
		<td class="en">Harry and Bill Heather had dragged the trunk off the little dray, and she retreated before them as they came up the shop step with it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把它搁在哪儿？”哈里问。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Wheer shalt ha’e it?’ asked Harry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“最好搬到楼上去。”范妮说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Best take it upstairs,’ said Fanny.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她先走上楼去点亮了煤气灯。</td>
		<td class="en">She went up first to light the gas.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >希瑟走后，哈里坐下来喝茶，吃猪肉饼，这时范妮问道：“那个大喊大叫的女人是谁？”</td>
		<td class="en">When Heather had gone, and Harry was sitting down having tea and pork pie, Fanny asked: ‘Who was that woman shouting?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不知道，这我可没法告诉你。总是冲着某人来的吧，我想。”哈里回答道。范妮看了看他，没再问下去了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Nay, I canna tell thee.To somebody, Is’d think,’ replied Harry.Fanny looked at him, but asked no more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他三十二岁了，浅黄的头发，浅黄的胡子。操着浓重的乡音，像一个翻砂工人，事实也正是如此。不过女人们总是很喜欢他。他具有一种母亲的宝贝儿子的气质——热情、顽皮而十分敏感。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a fair-haired fellow of thirty-two, with a fair moustache.He was broad in his speech, and looked like a foundry-hand, which he was.But women always liked him.There was something of a mother’s lad about him—something warm and playful and really sensitive.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就算对范妮，他也是有吸引力的。令她非常懊恼的是他胸无大志。他是一个制模工，但是手艺平平。他已经三十二岁了，却连二十英镑也没攒起来。将来家里的花销得由她来提供。他不在乎。他就是不在乎。他根本没一点进取心。可也没有什么恶习——没有什么明显的恶习。但他就是无动于衷，边赚边花，一点也不在乎。然而，他看上去并不快乐。她记起他在火光照耀下的神情：心事重重，心不在焉。他坐在那儿吃着猪肉饼，鼓着两个腮帮子，她觉得他像是她的宿命。她为这个宿命感到愤怒。这倒不是因为他很粗鄙。他举止虽粗俗，但几乎是有意而为。事实上他本人并不粗俗。比如，饮食对他来说并不是特别重要，他并不贪吃。他也有自己的魅力，尤其是对于女人而言——他的金发，他敏感的个性，还有他能让女人感觉到她是高高在上的。但范妮了解她，了解他那古怪的、顽固而狭隘的性格，这几乎使她发狂。</td>
		<td class="en">He had his attractions even for Fanny.What she rebelled against so bitterly was that he had no sort of ambition.He was a moulder, but of very commonplace skill.He was thirty-two years old, and hadn’t saved twenty pounds.She would have to provide the money for the home.He didn’t care.He just didn’t care.He had no initiative at all.He had no vices—no obvious ones.But he was just indifferent, spending as he went, and not caring.Yet he did not look happy.She remembered his face in the fire-glow: something haunted, abstracted about it.As he sat there eating his pork pie, bulging his cheek out, she felt he was like a doom to her.And she raged against the doom of him.It wasn’t that he was gross.His way was common, almost on purpose.But he himself wasn’t really common.For instance, his food was not particularly important to him, he was not greedy.He had a charm, too, particularly for women, with his blondness and his sensitiveness and his way of making a woman feel that she was a higher being.But Fanny knew him, knew the peculiar obstinate limitedness of him, that would nearly send her mad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一直呆到九点半左右。她随他走到门口。</td>
		<td class="en">He stayed till about half past nine.She went to the door with him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你什么时候来？”他说着，把头朝着大致是他家的方向扬了扬。</td>
		<td class="en">‘When are you coming up?’ he said, jerking his head in the direction, presumably, of his own home.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我明天下午来。”她高兴地说。在范妮和他母亲古多尔太太之间，自然没有什么爱的流失。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I’ll come tomorrow afternoon,’ she said brightly.Between Fanny and Mrs. Goodall, his mother, there was naturally no love lost.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她再次尴尬地轻轻吻了他一下，说了声晚安。</td>
		<td class="en">Again she gave him an awkward little kiss, and said good-night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你知道的，孩子，如果他看起来不是那么热情，你也不要惊讶，”她的婶婶说，“这是你的过错。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You can’t wonder, you know, child, if he doesn’t seem so very keen,’ said her aunt.‘It’s your own fault.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，婶婶，要是他很热情，我反倒会受不了。他现在这样，我可以和他相处得更好。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, Aunt, I couldn’t stand him when he was keen.I can do with him a lot better as he is.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这两个女人坐下来，一直谈到深夜。她们彼此了解。和即将结婚的范妮一样，她的婶婶嫁给了一个配不上她的暴躁的男人——范妮的叔叔。他死了，范妮的父亲也死了。</td>
		<td class="en">The two women sat and talked far into the night.They understood each other.The aunt, too, had married as Fanny was marrying: a man who was no companion to her, a violent man, brother of Fanny’s father.He was dead, Fanny’s father was dead.</td></tr>
