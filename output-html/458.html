		<td class="en">Chapter 1  PETER BREAKS THROUGH   </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所有的小孩都会长大成人，但有一个例外。所有的小孩很快都会知道他们将要长大，而温迪是这样知道的。当温迪两岁的时候，有一天她在一个花园里玩耍。她摘了一朵花，拿着花向妈妈跑去。我想，她看起来肯定非常讨人喜欢，因为达林夫人把手放在胸口，大声说道：“噢，你为什么不能永远都像这样呢！”在这个问题上，事情的经过就是这样的。但是从此以后，温迪就知道了，她终究是要长大的。你通常在两岁以后就知道这一点了。两岁是一个终点，但也是一个起点。</td>
		<td class="en">All children, except one, grow up.They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this.One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother.I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for ever!”This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up.You always know after you are two.Two is the beginning of the end.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，他们住在14号（这是他们的房子在街道上的门牌号）。温迪出生之前，妈妈是主要角色。她是一位可爱的女士，喜欢幻想，嘴巴很甜，喜欢逗弄别人。她那喜欢幻想的脑袋瓜，就像是产自神秘东方的小盒子，一个套着另一个，不管你打开了多少个，里面总还有一个。而她那甜甜的喜欢逗弄人的嘴巴，总挂着一个吻，但温迪从来也得不到，虽然它明明就在右边的嘴角上。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course they lived at 14 (their house number on their street), and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林先生是这样赢得他太太的芳心的：她还是女孩时，身边有好些男孩。这些男孩长大后突然发现他们同时都爱上了她，因此他们全部都跑着去她家跟她求婚——但达林先生并没有这样做，他雇了一辆马车，第一个飞快地到达她家，于是他就这样得到她了。他得到了她所有的一切，除了最里层的那个盒子和那个吻。他对那个盒子从来都一无所知，而那个吻，随着时间的流逝，他也不再尝试着要去得到它了。温迪想，也许拿破仑能得到那个吻。但是我能想象他屡次尝试未果，之后生气地甩门而去的样子。</td>
		<td class="en">The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her.He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss.He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林先生老是向温迪吹嘘说，她妈妈不但爱他，而且敬重他。他是一个有高深学问的人，了解股票之类的事情。当然，没有人真的知道那些事，可他似乎挺了解的。他经常说股票涨了，股票跌了，说得头头是道，似乎能让每个女人都佩服他。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him.He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林夫人结婚的时候，穿着一身洁白的礼服。起初，她把家里的账簿记得非常仔细，甚至很愉快，就像玩游戏一样，连一个小菜芽都不会漏掉。可是渐渐地，整堆的花椰菜都漏记了，却出现了一些没有脸的小娃娃的图画。当她应该算总账的时候，她却画上了这些图画。达林夫人猜想着她的宝宝可能要来了。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.She drew them when she should have been totting up.They were Mrs. Darling’s guesses.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪第一个出生了，然后是约翰，最后是迈克尔。</td>
		<td class="en">Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪出生后的一两个星期，达林夫妇不知道他们能否留下她，因为她的出生意味着家里多了一个人要吃饭。达林先生有了温迪非常地得意，但是他同时也是一个很实在的人，他坐在达林夫人的床边，握着她的手，计算着开销，而达林夫人则恳求地望着他。她想，无论如何，都要冒险试一试，但是达林先生却不是这么做的。他拿起一支笔和一张纸开始算账，如果达林夫人提的意见打乱了他的思绪，他就又得重新算。</td>
		<td class="en">For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed.Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly.She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在不要打扰我了。”他会这样请求她。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now don’t interrupt,” he would beg of her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我这里有一镑十七先令，办公室里有两先令六个便士。我可以取消办公室里的咖啡开支，算是省下十先令，那么就有了两镑九先令六便士，再加上你的十八先令三便士，我们就有三镑九先令七便士，我的支票上还有五镑零先令零便士，这样总共有八镑九先令七便士——谁在那里动？——八镑九先令七便士，小数点进位七——别说话，亲爱的——再加上你借给那个找上门的人的一镑——安静点，宝宝——小数点进位宝宝——看，都让你们给搞乱了！——我刚才说的是九镑九先令七便士吗？是的，我说的是九镑九先令七便士，问题是，我们可以靠九镑九先令七便士过一年吗？”“当然可以啦，乔治。”她大声说道。但她是在偏袒温迪，现在达林先生才是两个人中真正更为厉害的人。</td>
		<td class="en">“I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven—who is that moving?—eight nine seven, dot and carry seven—don’t speak, my own—and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door—quiet, child—dot and carry child—there, you’ve done it!—did I say nine nine seven?yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?”“Of course we can, George,” she cried.But she was prejudiced in Wendy’s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别忘了腮腺炎。”他几乎是带着威胁的口吻提醒她，然后又接着算了起来。“腮腺炎要一镑，那是我算在账面的，但是我敢说可能要花得更多，就算三十先令——不要说话——麻疹要一镑五先令，风疹要花半个几尼，这样就要两镑十五先令六便士——不要晃手指——百日咳，算十五先令吧”——他就这么继续算着，而每次加起来的结果都不一样，但是最后温迪总算是熬过来了，腮腺炎减少到十二先令六便士，而两种麻疹也并作了一次治疗。</td>
		<td class="en">“Remember mumps,” he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again.“Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings—don’t speak—measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six—don’t waggle your finger—whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings”—and so on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰也遇到了同样的风险，迈克尔更是侥幸脱险，但是两个孩子都成功地留下来了，而且很快地，你就能看到他们三个排着队到福尔萨姆小姐的幼儿园里去上学，由他们的保姆陪同着。</td>
		<td class="en">There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom’s Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林夫人喜欢事事都顺其自然，但是达林先生却希望和邻居们保持一致。所以，他们当然得有一个保姆。由于他们很穷，孩子们喝牛奶花费得又多，所以他们的“保姆”其实是一只严肃的纽芬兰狗，名叫娜娜。在达林夫妇雇佣她之前，她并没有固定的主人。不过，她一直都认为孩子是很重要的。达林夫妇是在肯辛顿公园遇到她的。她在那里度过了大部分空闲的时间，经常把头伸进摇篮车窥探。那些粗心的保姆们很讨厌她，因为她总是跟她们回家，向雇佣她们的主人抱怨。事实证明，她的确是一名出色的保姆。给孩子洗澡的时候，她是如此地仔细周到。晚上不管任何时候，只要她照顾的孩子发出哪怕是很轻的一声哭叫，她就会立即醒来。她的窝当然是在育婴室里。她天生就知道，对待哪一种咳嗽不能掉以轻心，什么时候需要在脖子上围上长袜。她一向都对那些传统的治疗方法深信不疑，比如用大黄叶治病，而对细菌之类的新名词发出蔑视的声音。看她护送孩子们上学还真是给我们上了一堂行为规范课。孩子们乖的时候，她就静静地走在他们旁边；孩子们随便乱跑的时候，她就用头把他们推进队列。在约翰踢足球的日子里，她从未把他的毛衣落下过，而且嘴里总是叼着一把伞，以防下雨。在福尔萨姆小姐的幼儿园里，有一间地下室，保姆们在那里等着。一般保姆们会坐在条凳上，而娜娜则躺在地板上，但那是唯一的不同之处。她们假装无视娜娜，就因为她们觉得她的社会地位比她们低，而娜娜才鄙视她们那种无聊的谈话呢。她不喜欢达林夫人的朋友来育婴室，但是如果她们真的来了，她会首先把迈克尔的围裙扯下，给他换上那件带蓝色花边的，然后抚平温迪的衣服，再匆匆捋一捋约翰的头发。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse.As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her.She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses.She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse.How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry.Of course her kennel was in the nursery.She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat.She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on.It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed.On John’s footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain.There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the nurses wait.They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk.She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling’s friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael’s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s hair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没有哪个育婴室能够打理得比这儿更好了，达林先生也知道这一点。但是他有时又会担心，邻居们会不会有闲言碎语。</td>
		<td class="en">No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他得考虑到自己在这个城市的地位。</td>
		<td class="en">He had his position in the city to consider.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >娜娜还在另一方面困扰着他。他有时觉得她并不那么佩服他。“我知道她是非常崇拜你的，乔治。”达林夫人会这样向他保证，然后示意孩子们要对爸爸特别好。接着，动人的舞蹈跳起来了。他们家唯一的另一个仆人莉莎，有时也能获准加入。莉莎穿着长裙，带着女仆的帽子，看起来是多么矮小啊，虽然受雇的时候，她发誓她肯定不止十岁了。这些嬉闹的人们是多么快乐啊！而其中最快乐的要数达林夫人了，她疯狂地踮起脚尖旋转着，你能看得清的就只有那个吻。如果这时你冲了上去，没准还能得到它呢。在彼得·潘来临之前，再也没有比他们更单纯、更开心的家庭了。</td>
		<td class="en">Nana also troubled him in another way.He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him.“I know she admires you tremendously, George,” Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father.Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join.Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never see ten again.The gaiety of those romps!And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it.There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林夫人是在整理孩子们想法的时候第一次听说彼得的。每一位好妈妈晚上都有一个习惯，那就是等孩子们睡着后，搜索他们的思绪，把白天散落的东西归回原位，把一切收拾整齐，迎接第二天的早晨。如果你能醒着（不过当然你不能），你就会看到你的妈妈在做这些事情，而你会发现看她收拾东西是件非常有趣的事。那很像是在整理抽屉。我猜，你会看见她跪着，饶有趣味地察看你的一些东西，想不通你到底是从哪里捡到这东西的。她发现有些东西是讨人喜欢的，有些则是招人讨厌的。她把某个东西贴在脸上，仿佛它和小猫一样可爱，又赶紧地把另一件东西藏得不见踪影。当你清晨醒来的时候，那些你睡觉前揣着的淘气的念头和坏脾气都被叠得小小的，放在你脑子的底层，而在上层，整整齐齐铺放着的是你那些美好的想法，等着你去拾起。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s minds.It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her.It is quite like tidying up drawers.You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我不知道你是否看过人的心思的图片。医生有时会把你身上的其他部位画下来，而看你自己的图像会特别地有意思。但要是你看到医生在努力画一张孩子的心思的图，你会发现，那图不仅是令人费解的，还总是在绕圈。那上面有弯弯曲曲的线条，就像卡片上的体温记录。这些应该就是岛上的道路了吧，因为梦幻岛总的来说就是一个岛，四处散落着令人惊奇的色彩。海面上覆盖着珊瑚礁，漂流着轻快的小船；岛上有野人和孤零零的巢穴；有土地精灵们，他们大多是裁缝；有小河穿过的一个个洞穴；有王子们和他们的六个哥哥；有一间快要倒塌的小屋；还有一位长着鹰钩鼻、身材矮小的老妇人。如果那就是全部的话，这图画起来倒也简单。但是还有呢：第一天上学，宗教，爸爸，圆水池，针线活，谋杀案，绞刑，与格动词，吃巧克力布丁的日子，穿背带裤，数到九十九，自己拔牙得到了三便士，等等。这些要么是岛上的一部分，要么就是画在另外一张图片上了。总之，全部让人看不明白，尤其是在没有一件东西静止不动的情况下。</td>
		<td class="en">I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time.There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然啦，每个人心目中的梦幻岛各不相同。拿约翰来说吧，他的梦幻岛有一个礁湖，火烈鸟在湖上飞翔，约翰就朝它们射去。而迈克尔呢，年纪还很小，他的梦幻岛则是有一只火烈鸟，有很多礁湖在火烈鸟上面飞。约翰住在一艘倒扣在沙滩上的船上，迈克尔住在一个印第安人的帐篷里，温迪住在一间用树叶巧妙缝成的屋子里。约翰没有朋友，迈克尔只在夜晚有朋友，温迪有一匹被父母抛弃的狼宝宝。但总的来说，他们的梦幻岛就像一家人一样，如果站成一排，你会说它们的鼻子长得一模一样，等等。在这些充满魔力的海岸边，玩耍的孩子们总是在将他们简陋的小圆舟拖上岸。我们也去过那个地方，我们至今还能听到海浪的声音，但是，我们再也不上岸了。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal.John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together.John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth.On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles.We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在所有让人快乐的岛中，梦幻岛是最舒适、最紧凑的了，不大也不散——也就是说，从一次冒险到另一次冒险，距离虽有点远，但也算得上恰到好处。白天，你用椅子和桌布玩岛上的游戏时，一点也不会觉得害怕。可是，在你临睡前的两分钟，它几乎就会变得很真实了。那就是晚上要点灯的原因。</td>
		<td class="en">Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real.That is why there are night-lights.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林夫人在孩子们的脑袋中漫步的时候，偶尔会发现一些她无法理解的事，其中最叫她困惑的便是彼得这个名字。她对彼得一无所知，但在约翰和迈克尔的脑袋中他无处不在，而温迪的脑海中更是慢慢地开始涂满了这个名字。这个名字比其他任何字都要粗大和醒目。达林夫人盯着它看时，觉得它是那么古怪、自大。</td>
		<td class="en">Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter.She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him.The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs.  Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，他就是有点儿自大。”温迪遗憾地承认。妈妈一直不停地问她。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret.Her mother had been questioning her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但他是谁啊，我的宝贝？”“他是彼得·潘啊，你知道的，妈妈。”起初，达林夫人并不知道，但是后来她回想自己的童年，也记起了一个叫彼得·潘的孩子。据说，他和精灵们住在一起。有关他的许多故事可奇怪哩，比如说，当孩子们死的时候，他会陪着他们走上一段路，这样孩子们就不会害怕了。她那时是相信的，可现在她结婚了，也懂得了许多道理，便非常怀疑这样一个人是否存在。</td>
		<td class="en">“But who is he, my pet?”“He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies.There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“况且，”她对温迪说，“他现在应该长大了吧。”“噢，不，他没长大，”温迪信心满满地跟她保证，“而且他和我一样大。”温迪的意思是，彼得的身心都和她的一样大，她不知道自己是怎么知道的，反正她就是知道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by this time.”“Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently, “and he is just my size.”She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林夫人去问达林先生，他忍不住笑了。“记住我的话，”他说，“这只是娜娜塞进他们脑子里的可笑念头，这种念头狗才会有。别管了，这念头很快就会消失的。”但是这个念头并没有消失，而且不久，这个爱惹麻烦的男孩就让达林夫人大吃了一惊。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.“Mark my words,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have.Leave it alone, and it will blow over.”But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >孩子们会经历非常奇怪的事情，却丝毫不感到害怕。比如，他们会在事情发生一个星期后才想起来说，他们在树林里遇见了死去的爸爸，还和他一起玩游戏。一天早上，温迪就是这样漫不经心地透露出一件令人担忧的事。在育婴室的地板上发现了几片树叶，但孩子们昨天晚上上床睡觉的时候可没有。达林夫人对这些树叶感到很困惑，但温迪宽容地笑着说：“我相信这一定又是那个彼得干的！”“你到底说什么呢，温迪？”“他太顽皮了，也不擦干净他的脚印。”温迪叹了一口气说道。她可是一个爱干净的孩子。</td>
		<td class="en">Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him.It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation.Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: “I do believe it is that Peter again!”“Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”“It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing.She was a tidy child.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她解释起来倒真像有那么一回事——她觉得，有时彼得会在晚上来到育婴室，坐在她的床脚边，吹笛子给她听。遗憾的是，她从来没醒过，所以她不知道自己是怎么知道的，反正她就是知道。</td>
		<td class="en">She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her.Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在乱说什么，宝贝。不敲门谁也无法进来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想他应该是爬窗进来的。”温迪说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I think he comes in by the window,” she said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的，这可是三楼啊。”“可是树叶不就是在窗边发现的么，妈妈？”确实如此，那些树叶就是在靠窗很近的地方发现的。</td>
		<td class="en">“My love, it is three floors up.”“Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >达林夫人不知道该怎么理出头绪了。因为温迪觉得一切都是那么自然，你不能说她是在做梦而对此置之不理。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的孩子，”妈妈大声说道，“为什么你之前不告诉我呢？”“我忘记了。”温迪毫不在意地说。她正急着去吃早餐。</td>
		<td class="en">“My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me of this before?”“I forgot,” said Wendy lightly.She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >噢，没错，她肯定是在做梦。</td>
		<td class="en">Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“右边第二条路，一直走，直到天亮。”这就是彼得告诉温迪的去往梦幻岛的路。可即便是鸟儿，带着地图，在每个有风的角落里查找地图，也不能按照他的这些指示找到梦幻岛。你知道的，彼得只是想到什么说什么罢了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Second to the right, and straight on till morning.”That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions.Peter, you  see, just said anything that came into his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >刚开始，彼得的伙伴们深信他的话，而且飞行又是那么快乐，他们绕着教堂的顶端或路上那些高高的吸引人的东西飞，浪费了一些时间。</td>
		<td class="en">At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰和迈克尔比赛飞行，结果迈克尔领先了。</td>
		<td class="en">John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久前，他们还在为自己能绕着房间飞而感到很了不起，现在回想起来，真是感到丢脸。</td>
		<td class="en">They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久前。但是多久前呢？他们飞过海面之后，这个问题就开始困扰温迪了。约翰觉得这是他们飞过的第二片海、第三个夜晚。</td>
		<td class="en">Not long ago.But how long ago?They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously.John thought it was their second sea and their third night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时天是黑暗的，有时天是明亮的；有时他们觉得很冷，有时又觉得很热。不知道他们有时是真的饿了呢，抑或只是假装出来的，因为彼得有这样一个好玩的新方法给他们找吃的。彼得的方法是追赶那些嘴里叼着适合人类吃的食物的鸟儿，然后把食物抢过来。接着，鸟儿会紧追不舍，再把食物夺回去。他们就这样愉快地互相追赶了好几英里，最后互表好意就分开了。可温迪有些担心，她注意到，彼得似乎并不知道这种得到面包和黄油的做法相当古怪，他甚至不知道还有其他方法。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm.Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them?His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will.But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们自然不会装困，他们是真的困了。这是很危险的，因为只要他们一打盹，就会往下坠。糟糕的是，彼得竟然觉得这很有趣。</td>
		<td class="en">Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell.The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看呐，他又掉下去了！”当迈克尔突然像块石头似的往下坠时，彼得高兴地大叫。</td>
		<td class="en">“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“救他，救他！”温迪喊着，害怕地看着下面那片遥远而汹涌的海。</td>
		<td class="en">“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea far below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后，彼得划过天空，在迈克尔即将坠入大海的那一刻把他抓住了，他的动作可真是漂亮。但他总喜欢等到最后一刻，你会觉得，他感兴趣的不是救人，而是卖弄他的聪明才智。彼得还喜欢变着各种花样玩，这一刻他还喜欢玩的游戏，下一刻就玩腻了。所以，很有可能下次你掉下去的时候，他就不会去救你了。</td>
		<td class="en">Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life.Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得只要在空中保持仰卧姿势漂着，就能够睡觉而不会往下掉。但这至少一部分是因为他很轻，如果你在他后面向他吹口气，他就会漂得更快。</td>
		<td class="en">He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对他礼貌点。”当他们在玩“跟着我的队长”游戏时，温迪对约翰小声说道。“那你就跟他说，叫他不要再炫耀了。”约翰说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they were playing “Follow my Leader.”“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在玩“跟着我的队长”游戏时，彼得会飞近水面，触碰经过的每条鲨鱼的尾巴，就像在街上，你用手指触碰铁栏杆一样。彼得的这一招他们学不来，因此或许这更像是在炫耀，尤其是彼得老转过头，看他们错过了多少鲨鱼尾巴的时候。</td>
		<td class="en">When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing.They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们得对他好点。”温迪提醒弟弟们。“要是他把我们丢下不管该怎么办？”“我们可以回去。”迈克尔说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers.“What could we do if he were to leave us!”“We could go back,” Michael said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有他，我们怎么找到回去的路呢？”“嗯，那我们就继续飞。”约翰说。</td>
		<td class="en">“How could we ever find our way back without him?”“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那会很糟糕的，约翰。我们只能不停地飞，因为我们不知道怎么停下来。”这是真的，彼得忘了教他们如何停下来。</td>
		<td class="en">“That is the awful thing, John.We should have to go on, for we don’t know how to stop.”This was true. Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰说，即使是发生最糟糕的情况，他们也只要一直往前飞就好了。因为地球是圆的，他们总会飞回自己家窗口的。</td>
		<td class="en">John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to their own window.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那谁给我们找吃的呢，约翰？”“我很灵巧地从那只鹰的嘴里抢过一小块食物，温迪。”“那是你试了二十次之后才抢到的。”温迪提醒他。“即使我们找食物很在行，要是彼得不在身边帮忙，我们会撞到云朵之类的东西上去的。”事实上，他们经常撞到这些东西。虽然还老是踢腿，但现在他们能够飞得很稳了。只是如果看到前面有一朵云，他们越是想努力躲开，就越是会撞上它。如果娜娜跟着他们的话，这时她会在迈克尔的额头上绑上一条绷带。</td>
		<td class="en">“And who is to get food for us, John?”“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.”“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him.“And even though we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand.”Indeed they were constantly bumping.They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it.If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael’s forehead by this time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此刻，彼得没有和他们在一起。他们觉得，没有彼得，实在是太孤独了。彼得比他们飞得快多了，他会忽然就消失不见，去寻找一些他们无法参与的冒险。他会飞下来，为他和一颗星星说的非常好玩的话而哈哈大笑，但他已经忘了是什么话了；或者他会飞上来，身上还沾着美人鱼的鳞片，却说不出来到底发生了什么事。这对于那些没看过美人鱼的孩子们来说，着实令人生气。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves.He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share.He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening.It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果他这么快就忘了那些东西，”温迪推论，“我们怎么能期望他一直记着我们呢？”确实，有时他回来的时候，真的不记得他们了，至少不是那么清楚了。温迪对此很确定。白天，彼得正要从他们身边飞过的时候，温迪从他的眼神中察觉到，他刚刚认出了自己。有一次，她甚至得告诉彼得自己的名字。</td>
		<td class="en">“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how can we expect that he will go on remembering us?”Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well.Wendy was sure of it.She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是温迪啊。”她着急地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得很不好意思。“我说，温迪，”彼得轻声对她说，“如果你看到我忘了你，只要不停地说‘我是温迪’，那么我就会记起来了。”这当然很不能让人满意。但作为补偿，彼得给他们展示了如何平躺在一阵顺方向的强风上。这是一个多么有趣的变化啊，他们试了几次，发现能够安全地睡觉了。实际上，他们本来是想睡得久一些，但彼得很快就睡烦了。不一会儿，他就用那队长的口吻喊道：“我们从这里下去。”就这样，虽偶尔有些小吵闹，但总体上还是比较愉快的，他们已经快要到梦幻岛了。经过了好几个月，他们终于到了，而且，他们是径直飞去的，也许这不全是因为彼得或叮当的带领，更重要的是因为这个岛也在寻找他们。只有这样，才有可能看到那些充满魔力的海岸。</td>
		<td class="en">He was very sorry.“I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her, “always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying ‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll remember.”Of course this was rather unsatisfactory.However, to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found they could sleep thus with security.Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice, “We get off here.”So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them.It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就在那里。”彼得平静地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“There it is,” said Peter calmly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哪里，哪里？”“所有箭头指向的地方。”事实上，有一百万支金箭正在给孩子们指出梦幻岛的位置。所有的箭都是他们的朋友——太阳射出的，太阳想要在晚上离开之前，让孩子们认清去梦幻岛的路。</td>
		<td class="en">“Where, where?”“Where all the arrows are pointing.”Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪、约翰和迈克尔在空中踮起脚尖，第一次看到了梦幻岛。奇怪的是，他们一下子就都认出它来了，还没觉得害怕，于是他们冲它大声欢呼起来。他们觉得这不像是终于见到了梦想已久的东西，倒像是放假回家看见了老朋友。</td>
		<td class="en">Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sight of the island.Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to who they were returning home for the holidays.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“约翰，那里是礁湖。”“温迪，看，那些乌龟正在往沙堆里埋蛋呢。”“我说，约翰，我看到了你那只断腿的火烈鸟了！”“瞧啊，迈克尔，你的洞穴在那儿！”</td>
		<td class="en">“John, there’s the lagoon.”“Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.”“I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!”“Look, Michael, there’s your cave.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“约翰，灌木丛里的是什么？”“那是一匹母狼和她的宝宝们。温迪，我确信那就是你的小狼宝宝！”“我的船在那里，约翰，船舷都坏了！”“不，它不是。哎，我们已经烧掉了你的船。”“无论如何，就是她了。我说，约翰，我看到印第安人营寨里冒出的烟了！”“在哪里？指给我看，我就告诉你怎样通过烟的样子判断他们是不是要打仗。”“那里，就在神秘河对面。”“现在我看到了。是的，他们已经充分准备好，要打仗了。”彼得看到他们知道这么多，有一点生气。但如果他想在他们面前逞英雄，他很快就做到了。因为，我不是告诉过你们，他们很快就会害怕了吗？当箭消失的时候，恐惧就降临了，梦幻岛陷入了一片黑暗之中。</td>
		<td class="en">“John, what’s that in the brushwood?”“It’s a wolf with her whelps.Wendy, I do believe that’s your little whelp!”“There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”“No, it isn’t.Why, we burned your boat.”“That’s her, at any rate.I say, John, I see the smoke of the Indian camp!”“Where?Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they are on the war-path.”“There, just across the Mysterious River.”“I see now.Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them?It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以前在家里时，梦幻岛总是在大家睡前显得有点漆黑，有点吓人。然后，岛上出现了一些未知的荒芜地带，不断延伸，黑影在里面攒动；此时，野兽觅食的吼声也很不一样；最重要的是，你失去了赢得胜利的信心。看到夜灯还亮着，你会很开心。你甚至会喜欢听娜娜说，这只不过是壁炉架，梦幻岛只不过是想象出来的罢了。</td>
		<td class="en">In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime.Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win.You were quite glad that the night-lights were on.You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在那些日子里，梦幻岛当然是想象出来的。但现在，它是真的了，没有夜灯，天越来越黑，而娜娜在哪里呢？他们原本是分散开飞的，现在都紧紧地靠在彼得身边。最后，彼得那毫不在意的神情消失了，他的眼睛发出了亮光。每次他们碰到彼得的身体，就会感到一阵颤抖。他们现在正位于那个恐怖的岛的上空，飞得很低，有时还有树梢划过他们的脚。虽然空中看不到任何可怕的东西，但他们的速度变慢了，飞得越来越吃力，似乎要推开什么敌对的力量才能前进。他们有时在半空中停下来，等彼得用拳头打开路。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment, and where was Nana?They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now.His careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body.They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet.Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces.Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们不想让我们着陆。”彼得解释。</td>
		<td class="en">“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But he could not or would not say.Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时，彼得会停在空中，把手放在耳朵旁边，认真聆听，接着，又盯着下面看，那目光亮得似乎要把地面钻出两个洞来。做完这些后，他继续向前飞去。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth.Having done these things, he went on again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的勇气可真是惊人。“现在，你想要去冒险呢，”彼得随意地对约翰说，“还是想先喝点茶？”温迪飞快地说：“先喝点茶。”迈克尔感激地握了握她的手，可勇敢一些的约翰犹豫了。</td>
		<td class="en">His courage was almost appalling.“Would you like an adventure now,” he said casually to John, “or would you like to have your tea first?”Wendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么样的冒险呢？”约翰小心地问。</td>
		<td class="en">“What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有一个海盗就睡在我们下面的大草原上。”彼得对他说。“如果你想冒险的话，我们就飞下去杀了他。”“我看不到他。”约翰停顿了很久后说。</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,” Peter told him.“If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”“I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我看到他了。”“假如，”约翰说，声音有点沙哑，“他醒了呢？”彼得愤怒地说：“你不会以为我是趁他睡着的时候杀他的吧！我会先叫醒他，然后杀死他。我向来都是这么做的。”“我说！你杀了很多海盗吗？”“成吨呢。”约翰说“真厉害”，但他还是决定先喝茶。他问现在岛上是不是有很多海盗，彼得说，从来没有这么多过。</td>
		<td class="en">“I do.”“Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wake up.”Peter spoke indignantly，“You don’t think I would kill him while he was sleeping!I would wake him first, and then kill him.That’s the way I always do.”“I say!Do you kill many?”“Tons.”John said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first.He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had never known so many.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在谁是船长呢？”“胡克。”彼得回答，说到这个可憎的名字，他的脸变得很严肃。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，他们不再感到那么害怕了，因为叮当和他们一起飞行，在她的光的照耀下，他们可以看清对方了。不过，叮当可不能像他们飞得那么慢，所以她不得不绕着他们飞了一圈又一圈。他们就好像身处光环中一样向前飞去。温迪喜欢得不得了，直到后来彼得说出了这样做的缺点。</td>
		<td class="en">For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo.Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得想到了一个好主意。约翰的帽子。叮当同意在帽子里旅行，但帽子要拿在手里。约翰拿着帽子，尽管叮当希望由彼得拿着。不久，温迪接过帽子，因为约翰说，他飞行的时候，帽子会蹭到他的膝盖。这样一来，可有麻烦了——我们在后面会看到——因为叮当铃讨厌被温迪带着。</td>
		<td class="en">He had a happy idea.John’s hat!Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand.John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter.Presently Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在黑暗的帽子里，亮光被完全盖住了，他们静静地向前飞着。他们从来没有这么安静过，偶尔从远方传来一阵舔东西的声音，彼得解释说，那是野兽在浅滩边喝水；有时又会听到一种沙沙的声音，可能是树枝在相互摩擦，彼得却说，那是印第安人在磨刀。</td>
		<td class="en">In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence.It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the Indians sharpening their knives.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在就连这些声音也消失了。对迈克尔来说，这孤独感太可怕了。“如果有什么东西发出点声音就好了！”迈克尔大叫。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >礁湖上只剩下彼得孤零零一个人，他最后听到的声音是美人鱼一条接着一条回到她们海底卧室的响声。因为离得太远，他听不到她们关门的声音。但是，在她们居住的珊瑚穴里，每个门上都有一个小铃（就像大陆上那些最好的房子一样），彼得听到了铃声。</td>
		<td class="en">The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea.He was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >湖水平稳地涨上来了，渐渐没过了彼得的脚。在海水把他完全吞没之前，为了打发时间，彼得望着礁湖上唯一的一样东西。他以为那是一片漂流的纸片，也许是风筝的一部分。他闲得无聊，猜测着纸片漂到岸边需要多长时间。</td>
		<td class="en">Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon.He thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然，他发现这个东西有点奇怪，它无疑是带着某种目的来到这湖上的，因为它正和潮水对抗，有时战胜了潮水。这时候，总是站在弱者这边的彼得就会忍不住拍起手来。这是一张多么勇敢的纸片啊！</td>
		<td class="en">Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那其实并不是一张纸片，而是梦幻鸟。她坐在鸟巢上，正竭尽全力地向彼得划来。自从鸟巢掉进水中，她就学会了用翅膀划水，基本能划得动她那奇怪的小船。但彼得认出她的时候，她已经疲惫不堪了。梦幻鸟是来救他的，她想把鸟巢给他，尽管里面还有蛋。我对这只鸟挺好奇的，因为尽管彼得曾经对她不错，但他有时也会捉弄她。我只能这样推测，她就像达林夫人那样的女人一样，看到彼得满口的乳牙后，心软了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest.By working her wings, in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was very exhausted.She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there were eggs in it.I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her.I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那鸟大声跟彼得说，她来是为了什么；彼得也大声问那鸟，她在那里干什么。但是，他们当然都听不懂对方的话。在奇幻故事里，人可以和鸟自由交谈。此刻我多么希望，我能假装这也是一个奇幻故事，彼得能够和梦幻鸟随意问答。可最好还是忠于现实，我只想告诉你们实际上发生了什么事。他们不仅不能理解对方的话，连礼貌都忘记了。</td>
		<td class="en">She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other’s language.In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened.Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我——想——要——你——到——巢——里——来！”梦幻鸟叫道，尽可能地说得慢一些、清楚一些，“那——样——你——就——可——以——漂——到——岸——边，但——我——太——累——了，不——能——再——向——你——靠——拢，你——得——想——办——法——游——过——来。”“你在嘎嘎地叫什么？”彼得回答。</td>
		<td class="en">“I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,” the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible, “and—then—you—can—drift—ashore, but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try—to—swim—to—it.”“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么你不像平时一样，让鸟巢随风漂流？”“我——想——让——你——”梦幻鸟把刚才的话重复了一遍。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why don’t you let the nest drift as usual?”“I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it all over.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，彼得也试着说得慢些、清楚些。</td>
		<td class="en">Then Peter tried slow and distinct.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你——在——嘎——嘎——地——叫——什——么？”等等。</td>
		<td class="en">“What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >梦幻鸟不耐烦了，他们这种鸟都是急性子。</td>
		<td class="en">The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你个傻头傻脑的小笨蛋，”她尖叫道，“为什么你不照我的话做？”彼得觉出了她是在骂自己，他生气地胡乱回嘴：“你也是！”然后，相当奇怪的是，他们不约而同地骂了一句：“闭嘴！”“闭嘴！”然而，这只鸟下定决心要尽力救彼得，她使出了最后的力气，终于把巢推上了石头。然后她就飞走了，丢下了她的蛋，以表明她的意思。</td>
		<td class="en">“You dunderheaded little jay,” she screamed, “Why don’t you do as I tell you?”Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly: “So are you!”Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark: “Shut up!”“Shut up!”Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock.Then up she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得终于明白了，他抓住鸟巢，挥手向头顶上飞着的鸟表达谢意。不过，梦幻鸟在空中飞行可不是为了接受彼得的谢意，也不是想看他爬进巢里，而是要看他怎么处理她的蛋。</td>
		<td class="en">Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead.It was not to receive his thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >鸟巢里面有两个大白蛋，彼得把它们捧了起来，思考着。那鸟用翅膀盖住了脸，不敢看它们最后的下场，但她还是忍不住从羽毛缝中窥视。</td>
		<td class="en">There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected.The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我忘了有没有告诉过你们，在流囚石上有一块木板，是海盗们很久以前钉在那儿的，用来标示埋藏财宝的地方。孩子们发现这些发光的宝藏后，有时会淘气地抓起一把金币、钻石、珍珠和古币等，撒向海鸥。海鸥以为是食物，猛扑过来，发现被这种卑鄙的把戏骗了之后，非常生气，纷纷飞走。木板还在那里，上面挂着斯塔基的帽子——那是一顶高高的防水油布帽，帽沿宽宽的。彼得把蛋放到帽子里，把帽子放在水面上。它就优美地浮起来了。</td>
		<td class="en">I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure.The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them.The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon.It floated beautifully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >梦幻鸟一看到彼得的做法，就佩服得大声欢叫起来；哎哟，彼得也得意地叫着，表示同意。然后，彼得爬进巢里，把木板立起来当作桅杆，把他的衬衫挂起来当作帆。与此同时，梦幻鸟迅速地飞落在帽子上，又舒适地坐到她的蛋上。她向一边漂去，彼得向另一边漂去，皆大欢喜。</td>
		<td class="en">The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her.Then he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail.At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs.She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both cheering.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得上岸后，自然把他的小帆船放在梦幻鸟容易看见的地方。但那顶帽子实在是太顺她的意了，她竟遗弃了这个巢。鸟巢四处漂流，直到四分五裂。后来，斯塔基每次来到礁湖边，总看到梦幻鸟坐在他的帽子上，心里很痛苦。因为我们后面再也见不到梦幻鸟了，所以或许在这里值得一提，所有的梦幻鸟现在都把鸟巢筑成那个样子，有一道宽宽的边，这样幼鸟们就能在上面散步了。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest.It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat.As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得到达地下的家时，被风筝拽着东飘西荡的温迪也刚到家，大家都高兴极了。每个孩子都有冒险故事可讲，但最大的一件事，也许就是他们已经晚睡了好几个小时。这让他们非常得意，他们推三阻四，要求包扎伤口等等，想推迟睡觉的时间。温迪看到他们全都平安回家，虽然满心欢喜，但还是觉得时间晚得离谱了，于是喊道：“上床，上床。”那种语调让大家不得不服从。不过，第二天，她又变得很温柔了，给每个孩子都包扎了伤口。孩子们有的跛着脚，有的吊着胳膊，一直玩到上床睡觉。</td>
		<td class="en">Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite.Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed.This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, “To bed, to bed,” in a voice that had to be obeyed.Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（和海盗们）在礁湖上的交战有一个重要的结果——孩子们和印第安人成为了好朋友。彼得把虎莉从可怕的命运中救了出来，现在，虎莉和她的勇士们愿意为彼得做任何事。他们整夜坐在上面看守地下的家，等待海盗们的大举进攻。很明显，海盗们很快就会来了。即使在白天，他们也在周围闲逛，安逸地吸着烟斗，仿佛在等待什么诱人的小吃。</td>
		<td class="en">One important result of the brush (with the pirates) on the lagoon was that it made the Indians their friends.Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him.All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed.Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们称呼彼得为“伟大的白人父亲”，拜倒在他的脚下。彼得可喜欢这个啦，不过这对他没什么好处。</td>
		<td class="en">They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他们拜倒在他脚边的时候，彼得会高傲地对他们说：“伟大的白人父亲非常乐意看到北美印第安武士保护他的小屋，使其免受海盗的侵扰。”“我虎莉，”那个可爱的人回答说，“彼得·潘救了我，我就是他的好朋友。我不会让海盗们伤害他。”虎莉太美丽了，没必要对他这样奉承，但彼得认为这是他应得的，于是他屈尊回答：“这很好。彼得·潘说了。”通常，他说“彼得·潘说了”时，意思就是现在他们得闭上嘴巴，他们也就心领神会，恭恭敬敬地服从命令了。但他们绝不会对其他孩子这么恭敬，因为他们认为这些孩子只不过是普通的勇士罢了。他们只会对孩子们说“你好！”之类的话。让孩子们生气的是，彼得似乎觉得这是理所当然的。</td>
		<td class="en">“The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordly manner, as they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates.”“Me Tiger Lily,” that lovely creature would reply.“Peter Pan save me, me his velly nice friend.Me no let pirates hurt him.”She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, and he would answer condescendingly, “It is good.Peter Pan has spoken.”Always when he said, “Peter Pan has spoken,” it meant that they must now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just ordinary braves.They said “How—do?” to them, and things like that; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪私底下有点同情孩子们，但她是一个很忠诚的主妇，不会听任何抱怨爸爸的话。“爸爸知道得最清楚。”她总是这么说，不管她的个人意见是什么。她的个人意见是，印第安人不该叫她“老婆”。</td>
		<td class="en">Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father.“Father knows best,” she always said, whatever her private opinion must be.Her private opinion was that the Indians should not call her a squaw.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们已经来到了那个晚上，他们称那一晚为“夜中夜”，因为这一夜发生的事情及其结果很重要。白天一天无事，仿佛是在静静地养精蓄锐。印第安人裹着毯子在上面站岗，孩子们在下面吃晚餐。只有彼得不在，他出去查探时间了。在岛上，查探时间的方法是，找到那条鳄鱼，然后在它身边呆着，直到钟声响起。</td>
		<td class="en">We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot.The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the Indians in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time.The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这顿饭恰好是一顿假想出来的茶点，他们围坐在桌边，贪婪地大吃大喝。而他们谈话、互相指责的吵闹声，用温迪的话说，简直是震耳欲聋。温迪当然不会在意吵闹声，她只是不允许他们抢东西，还找借口说是图图推了他们的手肘。他们有一条规定是，吃饭的时候不能回击，而是应该礼貌地举起右手，把分歧反映给温迪，说：“我控诉什么什么。”不过，实际上，他们不是忘了这么做，就是做得太多了。</td>
		<td class="en">The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow.There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying, “I complain of so—and—so;” but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“安静。”温迪大声喊道，这是她第二十次告诉他们不要同时讲话。“你的大杯子空了吗，斯莱特利宝贝？”“还不太空，妈咪。”斯莱特利看了看想象出来的大杯子，然后说。</td>

		<td class="en">“Well, John?”“May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”“Sit in father’s chair, John!”Wendy was scandalised.“Certainly not.”“He is not really our father,” John answered.“He didn’t even know how a father does till I showed him.”This was grumbling.“We complain of John,” cried the twins.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那个愚蠢的家伙，”温迪说，“想用肥皂粘影子，粘不上他就哭，哭声把我吵醒了，我就给他把影子缝上了。”“你漏掉了一些。”简插嘴说，现在她比妈妈知道得还清楚。“当你看到他坐在地板上哭泣时，你说了什么？”“我从床上坐起来，说：‘孩子，你哭什么呢？’”“没错，就是这样。”简说，大大地松了一口气。</td>
		<td class="en">“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on with soap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for him.”“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better than her mother.“When you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did you say?”“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are you crying?’”“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“然后，他带我们飞到了梦幻岛，那里有精灵、海盗、印第安人、美人鱼的礁湖、地下的家，还有小房子。”“没错！你最喜欢什么？”“我想，我最喜欢地下的家。”“我也是。彼得最后对你说了什么？”“他对我说的最后一句话是：‘只要永远等着我，在某个晚上，你就能听到我的叫声了。’”“是的。”“但是，唉，他把我全忘了。”温迪微笑着说。她已经长得那么大了。</td>
		<td class="en">“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the Indians and the mermaid’s lagoon, and the home under the ground, and the little house.”“Yes!Which did you like best of all?”“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”“Yes, so do I.What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.’”“Yes.”“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile.She was as grown up as that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他的叫声听起来像什么？”简有一天晚上问。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就像这样。”温迪说，试着模仿彼得的叫声。</td>
		<td class="en">“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s crow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，不是这样，”简严肃地说，“是这样。”她模仿得比妈妈好多了。</td>
		<td class="en">“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was like this”; and she did it ever so much better than her mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪有点惊讶。“亲爱的，你怎么知道？”“我睡觉的时候，经常听到。”简说。</td>
		<td class="en">Wendy was a little startled.“My darling, how can you know?”“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，是的，许多女孩在睡觉的时候都听到了，但我是唯一一个醒着听到的。”“你真幸运。”简说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only one who heard it awake.”“Lucky you,” said Jane.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后有一天晚上，不幸的事发生了。那是一年春天，晚上听完故事，简躺在床上睡觉。温迪在地板上坐着，离火炉很近，借着火光补衣服，因为育婴室里没有别的亮光了。正当温迪补着衣服时，她听到了一声叫喊声。然后，和过去一样，窗户被吹开了，彼得跳进来，落在了地板上。</td>
		<td class="en">And then one night came the tragedy.It was the spring of the year, and the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed.Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow.Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他和过去一模一样，温迪一眼就看到，他仍然长着满口的乳牙。</td>
		<td class="en">He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他还是一个小男孩，可温迪已经长大了。她缩在火炉旁，不敢乱动，心里满是无助和难堪，因为她已经是一个大女人了。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好，温迪。”彼得说，他没有注意到有什么不一样，因为他总是想着他自己。在昏暗的灯光下，温迪的白裙子，就像是他第一次见她时穿的那件睡衣一样。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好，彼得。”温迪轻声回答，尽可能地把自己缩得小一点。她心里有一个声音在呐喊：“女人，女人，放开我。”“喂，约翰在哪里？”彼得问，忽然发现少了第三张床。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible.Something inside her was crying, “Woman, Woman, let go of me.”“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“约翰现在不在这里。”温迪气喘吁吁地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“John is not here now,” she gasped.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“迈克尔睡着了吗？”彼得问，随意地瞥了简一眼。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的。”温迪回答，现在她觉得，她同时背叛了简和彼得两个人。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那不是迈克尔。”她连忙改口说道，免得遭报应。</td>
		<td class="en">“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得看着简。“喂，这是一个新的孩子吗？”“是的。”“男孩还是女孩？”“女孩。”现在彼得应该明白了吧，但他一点都不明白。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter looked.“Hullo, is it a new one?”“Yes.”“Boy or girl?”“Girl.”Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“彼得，”温迪迟疑地说，“你想要我和你一起飞走吗？”“当然了，我来就是为了这个。”他略显严肃地又说：“难道你忘了，到了春季大扫除的时候了吗？”温迪知道，用不着跟他说有许多次春季大扫除他都漏掉了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to fly away with you?”“Of course; that is why I have come.”He added a little sternly, “Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不能去，”温迪抱歉地说，“我已经忘了怎么飞。”“我马上可以再教你啊。”“彼得，不要把仙尘浪费在我身上了。”温迪站了起来，现在，终于有一阵恐惧向彼得袭来。“怎么了？”彼得大叫着向后退。</td>
		<td class="en">“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I have forgotten how to fly.”“I’ll soon teach you again.”“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him.“What is it?” he cried, shrinking.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我要开灯了，”温迪说，“这样，你就能亲眼看看了。”据我所知，这是彼得生平第一次害怕。“不要开灯。”他大叫。</td>
		<td class="en"> “I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can see for yourself.”For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪用手抚摸着这个可怜孩子的头发。她不再是一个为彼得心碎的小女孩了，她变成了一个成年女人，笑着看待这一切，可那笑里却带着眼泪。</td>
		<td class="en">She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy.She was not a little girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were wet eyed smiles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后她打开了灯，彼得看到了。他痛苦地哭了起来，当这个高挑美丽的女人弯腰去抱他时，他突然向后退去。</td>
		<td class="en">Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw.He gave a cry of pain; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么了？”他又大喊一声。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is it?” he cried again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪只好告诉他。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我长大了呀，彼得。我已经二十几岁了。很久以前，我就长大了。”“你说过，你不会长大的。”“这不是我能控制的。我是一个结了婚的女人，彼得。”“不，你不是。”“是的，床上那个小女孩是我的孩子。”“不，她不是。”但彼得觉得她确实是温迪的孩子，他高高地举起匕首，向那个熟睡的孩子走了过去。当然，他没有刺下去。他在地板上坐下来，开始啜泣。温迪不知道怎么安慰他，尽管她曾经很容易就可以做到。现在，她只是一个女人，于是她跑出房去，想着该怎么办。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am old, Peter.I am ever so much more than twenty.I grew up long ago.”“You promised not to!”“I couldn’t help it.I am a married woman, Peter.”“No, you’re not.”“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”“No, she’s not.”But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised.Of course he did not strike.He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could have done it so easily once.She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the room to try to think.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得一直哭，很快，他的哭声就把简吵醒了。简在床上坐了起来，立刻对彼得产生了兴趣。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane.She sat up in bed, and was interested at once.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“孩子，”她说，“你为什么哭泣？”彼得站起来，向她鞠躬，她在床上向彼得回礼。</td>
		<td class="en">“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好。”他说。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的名字是彼得·潘。”他告诉简。</td>
		<td class="en">“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我知道。”“我回来找我妈妈，”彼得解释道，“带她去梦幻岛。”“我知道，”简说，“我一直都在等你。”当温迪踌躇地回到房间时，她发现彼得坐在床柱上，正洋洋自得地欢呼，而简穿着睡衣，在房间里兴高采烈地飞来飞去。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, I know.”“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her to the Neverland.”“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting for you.”When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她是我的妈妈了。”彼得解释道。简飞下来，站在彼得旁边，脸上露出了女士们盯着彼得看时的那种神情，这是彼得最喜欢看到的。</td>
		<td class="en">“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他实在太需要一个妈妈了。”简说。</td>
		<td class="en">“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Yes, I know.” Wendy admitted rather forlornly;　“no one knows it so well as I.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再见。”彼得对温迪说，然后他飞入空中，不知害羞的简也毫不犹豫地跟着他飞走了。飞行已经成了她最方便的活动方式了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the shameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >温迪冲到窗前。</td>
		<td class="en">Wendy rushed to the window.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，不。”她大喊。</td>
		<td class="en">“No, no,” she cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“只是去进行春季大扫除，”简说，“他想让我经常去帮他进行春季大扫除。”“要是我能跟你们一起去，该多好啊。”温迪叹息道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wants me always to do his spring cleaning.”“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是你不能飞了。”简说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，温迪最后还是让他们一起飞走了。我们最后一次看到她，她正站在窗前，看着他们在空中渐渐远去，直到变得和星星一样小。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together.Our last glimpse of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你再见到温迪时，会看到她的头发已经变白了，身体又变小了，因为，这一切都是很久以前发生的。简现在是一个普通的大人了，有个女儿叫玛格丽特。每到春季大扫除的时候，除非忘了，否则彼得都会来找玛格丽特，把她带到梦幻岛。玛格丽特在梦幻岛上，给彼得讲关于他自己的故事，彼得总是认真地听着。玛格丽特长大后，又会有一个女儿，她又成了彼得的妈妈。事情就这样继续下去，只要孩子们是无忧无虑、天真无邪、没心没肺的。</td>
		<td class="en">As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure little again, for all this happened long ago.Jane is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly.When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn; and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.</td></tr>
