		<td class="en">她想，这条戴着蛇形锁的恶龙是不是会像奶娘给她讲过的古老故事里的那条龙那样，被变成石头？或者，会不会从镜心里飞出一些燃烧着的火镖，把恶龙击毙？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Neither of these things occurred, but, instead, the dragon stopped short with surprise and rage when he saw a monster before him as big and strong as himself.</td>
		<td class="en">但是这种事一件也没发生。相反，恶龙看到自己面前有一个怪物，和它自己一样又大又强，顿时愣了一会儿，又惊又气。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">瞬间，镜子在恶龙脚下碎成千片，而每一片都照出它身上的一部分，恶龙觉得自己也成了一堆碎片。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was the moment for which the Knight of the Fish had watched and waited, and before the dragon could find out that he was not hurt at all, the young man’s lance was down his throat, and he was rolling, dead, on the grass.</td>
		<td class="en">鱼骑士观察着，他等的就是这一刻。恶龙还没弄明白自己其实并没受伤，骑士的长矛就刺进了它的喉咙。恶龙在草地上打了几个滚就死掉了。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">要靠近这座城堡需要很大的勇气，因为光是看着它都令人觉得毛骨悚然。它就像暴风雨的夜晚那般黑，安静得如同一座坟墓。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the Knight of the Fish knew no fear, and had never turned his back on an enemy; so he drew out his horn, and blew a blast.</td>
		<td class="en">但是鱼骑士毫不畏惧，勇于正面迎敌，他拿出号角吹了一声。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The sound awoke all the sleeping echoes in the castle, and was repeated now loudly, now softly; now near, and now far.</td>
