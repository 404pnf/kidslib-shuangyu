		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我曾带着深深的哀伤凝视了许久霍尔拜因画笔下的农夫，然后我漫步田间，思考着乡村生活和农夫的命运。一个农夫耗尽他的的气力和生命在这片吝啬的土地上犁地耕耘，而土地只有在胁迫之下才会产出丰饶的宝藏。可一天辛苦工作的奖赏和利润只是些许最黑、最粗糙的面包。无疑，这是一件可悲的事。这些从土地中生长的财富，这些庄稼、水果、丰美青草养肥的值得称耀的牲畜只是少数人的财产，却是使多数人受累和被奴役的工具。一般来说，有闲者自己并不爱田地、草场、大自然的美景，也不爱能换成金币供他使用的肥硕牲口。有闲人者来乡村透透气、散散心，调养好身体之后，便回到城里挥霍奴仆们劳动的果实。</td>
		<td class="en">I had been gazing for a long time and with profound sadness at Holbein’s ploughman, and I was walking in the fields, musing upon country-life and the destiny of the husbandman.Doubtless it is a depressing thing to consume one’s strength and one’s life driving the plough through the bosom of the jealous earth, which yields the treasures of its fecundity only under duress, when a bit of the blackest and coarsest bread at the end of the day is the only reward and the only profit of such laborious toil.The wealth that covers the ground, the crops, the fruit, the proud cattle fattening on the long grass, are the property of a few, and the instruments of fatigue and slavery of the majority.As a general rule, the man of leisure does not love, for themselves, the fields, or the meadows, or the spectacle of nature, or the superb beasts that are to be converted into gold pieces for his use.The man of leisure comes to the country in search of a little air and health, then returns to the city to spend the fruit of his vassal’s toil.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而做苦力的人呢，太累，太悲惨，对未来充满恐惧，哪里有心思去欣赏田野的美景和乡村生活的乐趣。对他来说，金黄的田野、秀丽的草场、壮观的牲口群意味着一袋袋的钱币，从中他只能分到微不足道的一份，还不够养活自己，然而那些该死的钱袋还得每年装得满满的，好满足他们的主子，以便使自己获得在主子的领地内过拮据和悲惨生活的权利。</td>
		<td class="en">The man of toil, for his part, is too crushed, too wretched, and too frightened concerning the future, to enjoy the beauties of the landscape and the charms of rustic life.To him also the golden fields, the lovely meadows, the noble animals, represent bags of crowns, of which he will have only a paltry share, insufficient for his needs, and yet those cursed bags must be filled every year to satisfy the master and pay for the privilege of living sparingly and wretchedly on his domain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，大自然的年轻、美丽和慷慨一如往昔。她把诗意和美丽倾注在一切生命体上，倾注在一切自由生长的植物上。大自然掌握了幸福的奥秘，还没人能成功地从它那里将其夺走过。一个人如果技艺在身，勤劳肯干，运用智慧的力量赢得幸福和自由，有时间去感受和思考，了解自己的工作，也热爱上帝的事业，那么这样的人是最幸运的。艺术家们在注视和再现大自然之美时，也拥有那种乐趣。但是一旦看到在这个天堂般的地球上繁衍的人们在忍受苦难时，拥有正义感和好心肠的艺术家不免悲从中来。在上帝的注视下，精神、心灵和肢体保持协调，这就是真正的幸福所在，在上帝的仁慈和人类灵魂的愉悦之间便有了一种神圣的和谐。于是，画寓言作品的画家就可以把一位祥光笼罩的天使画在农夫身旁，大把地将带着祝福的种子播撒在冒着水汽的田沟里，而不是去画一位手执鞭子、行走于犁沟间、伪善而恐怖的死神。</td>
		<td class="en">And still nature is always young and beautiful and generous.She sheds poetry and beauty upon all living things, upon all the plants that are left to develop in their own way.Nature possesses the secret of happiness, and no one has ever succeeded in wresting it from her.He would be the most fortunate of men who, possessing the science of his craft and working with his hands, deriving happiness and liberty from the exercise of his intelligent strength, should have time to live in the heart and the brain, to understand his work, and to love the work of God.The artist has enjoyment of that sort in contemplating and reproducing the beauties of Nature; but, when he sees the suffering of the men who people this paradise called the earth, the just, kind-hearted artist is grieved in the midst of his enjoyment.Where the mind, heart, and arms work in concert under the eye of Providence, true happiness would be found, and a holy harmony would exist between the munificence of God and the delights of the human soul.Then, instead of piteous, ghastly Death walking in his furrow, whip in hand, the painter of allegories could place beside the ploughman a radiant angel, sowing the blessed grain in the smoking furrows with generous hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于一位农夫来说，平静、自由、诗意、勤劳、纯朴的生活梦想并不是难以实现的，不必将其看作是妄想。“哦，要是农夫知道自己的幸福，他的生活该会多么幸福啊！”维吉尔温和、忧郁的词语传递出一种遗憾情绪，但和所有遗憾一样，遗憾也是一种预言。有朝一日，农夫也会成为一个艺术家，即使不能表现美——或许那时已无关紧要——无论如何也能感受到美。你相信在他身上，这种神秘的诗意直觉难道不是已经存在于本能和模糊的遐想中吗？今天，在那些有一点儿生活保障的人群里，在那些没有因过度的苦难而完全扼杀道德和心智发展的人群里，能感受和领会的纯粹幸福只是处于初级阶段的幸福，况且，如果诗人的声音已从痛苦和疲惫的胸膛里迸发出来，为什么还要说将体力劳动排斥在智力活动之外呢？这种排斥可能是过度劳动和极端贫困造成的普遍结果。即便如此，我们也不能说当人们只是适度劳动就有所收获时，世上便只有差劲的工人和糟糕的诗人了。一个能从内心诗意情感中获得高尚乐趣的人是一个真正的诗人，即便他一生中从没有写过一行诗。</td>
		<td class="en">And the dream of a peaceful, free, poetical, laborious, simple existence for the husbandman is not so difficult of conception that it need be relegated to a place among chimeras.The gentle, melancholy words of Virgil: “O how happy the life of the husbandman, if he but knew his happiness!” is an expression of regret; but, like all regrets, it is also a prediction.A day will come when the ploughman may be an artist, if not to express,—which will then matter but little, perhaps,—at all events, to feel, the beautiful.Do you believe that this mysterious intuition of poesy does not already exist within him in the state of instinct and vague revery?In those who have a little hoard for their protection to-day, and in whom excess of misery does not stifle all moral and intellectual development, pure happiness, felt and appreciated, is at the elementary stage; and, furthermore, if poets’ voices have already arisen from the bosom of sorrow and fatigue, why should it be said that the work of the hands excludes the exercise of the functions of the mind?That exclusion is probably the general result of excessive toil and profound misery; but let it not be said that when man shall work only moderately and profitably, then there will be none but bad workmen and bad poets.He who derives noble enjoyment from the inward sentiment of poesy is a true poet, though he has never written a line in his life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我这样想着，由于外部的影响，我并没有察觉到在我心里对人的可教育性增添了信心。我沿着一片田地的边缘地带走着，农夫们正在田里准备播种。这块田很大，就如霍尔拜因画中的田地一样。景色也很开阔，深褐色的土壤四周都是碧绿的带状；秋天临近使得土地稍微有点泛红，犁好的田沟里积着不久前下的雨水，在阳光的照射下就如纤细的银线，闪闪发亮。天气干涩温暖，泥土刚被锋利的犁翻过，散发出微微的水汽。在这块田的高处有一位老人，脊背宽阔，脸色严峻，让人想起霍尔拜因画里的农夫，但不同的是他的穿着并不寒酸。老人严肃地推着他的老式犁，前面由两头老实的牛拉着。它们是田里真正的主宰者。这两头牛的皮毛是淡黄色的，又高又瘦，牛角长而钝。它们常年在一起，亲如兄弟，在乡下人们也这样说，如果两头牛被拆开了，它们会拒绝和新伙伴一起干活，直到郁郁而终。不熟悉乡村的人会觉得耕牛之间这种所谓的友谊不可思议。让他们到牛棚里看看吧，一头瘦骨嶙峋、精疲力尽的牲口用不安分的尾巴拍打瘦削的两侧身子，恐惧但又轻蔑地对放在它面前的饲料呼着气，牛眼睛总是看向门边，牛蹄不停地刨着身旁的空地，牛鼻嗅着它伙伴戴的犁轭和铁链的味道，用悲惨的哞哞声不停地呼喊着它的伙伴。赶牛人会说：“它的兄弟死了，它也不干活了，我损失了两头牛。我们想把它养肥再宰掉，但它不吃东西，很快就会饿死。”</td>
		<td class="en">My thoughts had taken this course, and I did not notice that this confidence in man’s capacity for education was strengthened in my mind by external influences.I was walking along the edge of a field which the peasants were preparing for the approaching sowing.The field was an extensive one, like that in Holbein’s picture.The landscape, too, was of great extent and framed in broad lines of verdure, slightly reddened by the approach of autumn, the lusty brown earth, where recent rains had left in some of the furrows lines of water which sparkled in the sun like slender silver threads.It was a blight, warm day, and the ground, freshly opened by the sharp ploughshares, exhaled a slight vapor.At the upper end of the field, an old man, whose broad back and stern face recalled the man in Holbein’s picture, but whose clothing did not indicate poverty, gravely drove his old-fashioned areau, drawn by two placid oxen, with pale yellow hides, veritable patriarchs of the fields, tall, rather thin, with long, blunt horns, hard-working old beasts whom long companionship has made brothers, as they are called in our country districts, and who, when they are separated, refuse to work with new mates and die of grief.People who know nothing of the country call this alleged friendship of the ox for his yoke-fellow fabulous.Let them go to the stable and look at a poor, thin, emaciated animal, lashing his sunken sides with his restless tail, sniffing with terror and contempt at the fodder that is put before him, his eyes always turned toward the door, pawing the empty place beside him, smelling the yoke and chains his companion wore, and calling him incessantly with a pitiful bellow.The driver will say: “There’s a yoke of oxen lost; his brother’s dead, and he won’t work.We ought to fatten him for killing; but he won’t eat, and he’ll soon starve to death.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那位老农夫一声不吭慢慢地犁着田，不愿因说话而多花力气。他温顺的耕牛看起来和他一样不慌不忙。老农一心一意地干着活，从不东张西望，用力均匀又恰如其分，他犁起地来和他儿子一样快。他儿子在不远处赶着四头力气稍小的公牛，耕着一块满是石头且土质坚硬的地。</td>
		<td class="en">The old ploughman was working slowly, in silence, without useless expenditure of strength.His docile team seemed in no greater hurry than he; but as he kept constantly at work, never turning aside, and exerting always just the requisite amount of sustained power, his furrow was as quickly cut as his son’s, who was driving four less powerful oxen on some harder and more stony land a short distance away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，接下来吸引我的景象很美，是画家创作的理想素材。在耕地的另一头，一个英俊的年轻人驾驭着一支出色的队伍：四对年轻力壮的耕牛，一身漆黑的皮毛上点缀着褐色的斑点，发出似火的亮光，粗短的头颅上一头卷毛，散发着野牛的气息。它们双眼大而充满野性，动作蛮横，干活急躁，虽然刚刚屈服于驾驭，却对轭和牛鞭的束缚怒气不止、浑身发抖。它们就是所谓新上套的牛。这个赶着牛的人要耕完一片不久前还是牧场的地，地里满是老树根。光靠他的力气、他的年轻和他那八头还未驯服的牛还远不能干完这样一件力气活。</td>
		<td class="en">But the spectacle that next attracted my attention was a fine one indeed, a noble subject for a painter.At the other end of the arable tract, a young man of attractive appearance was driving a superb team: four yoke of young beasts, black-coated with tawny spots that gleamed like fire, with the short, curly heads that suggest the wild bull, the great, wild eyes, the abrupt movements, the nervous, jerky way of doing their work, which shows that the yoke and goad still irritate them and that they shiver with wrath as they yield to the domination newly imposed upon them.They were what are called oxen freshly yoked.The man who was guiding them had to clear a field until recently used for pasturage, and filled with venerable stumps—an athlete’s task which his energy, his youth, and his eight almost untamed beasts were hardly sufficient to accomplish.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个约摸六七岁的小孩，长得如天使般漂亮，穿着罩衫，肩上披着羊皮，活脱脱像文艺复兴时期画家作品里施洗礼的小约翰。他沿着与犁平行的一条犁沟步履艰难地走着，用一根又长又轻却并不尖利的小棒戳着牛群两侧的身体。这群高傲的牲畜们在这个孩子的小手下颤抖着，牛轭和箍在前额上的皮带啪啪作响，犁也随之猛地向前拽动。每当一个树根挡住犁头时，农夫便大声吆喝着每头牛的名字，不是为了刺激它们，而是使它们镇定下来。因为这群牛被突如其来的阻力激怒时，它们会向前蹦去，宽大的叉状牛蹄会在地上挖出洞来，要是年轻人不用吆喝和刺棒控制住领头的四头牛，一旁的小孩不能管住另外四头的话，这群牛便会转向一边，拖着犁朝旁边耕过去。可怜的小孩也吆喝着，竭力让自己的声音听起来可怕，但是如他天使般的脸蛋一样，他的声音也很甜美。整个景象充满了力量和优雅之美：景色、年轻人、孩童、套着犁的公牛。尽管土地被征服的过程中充满了力量的挣扎，但仍有一种平和与静谧萦绕着这一切。待障碍物被清除后，这个队伍继续平稳庄重地前行。犁田的农夫装出来的凶狠只不过使他稍微活动了一下筋骨，发泄了活力。他很快又恢复了那种淳朴心灵的宁静，向他的孩子投去了满意的一瞥，孩子也朝着他笑了笑。随后，这个年轻的父亲便用他那雄浑的嗓音唱起庄严又充满忧郁的曲子。这种当地自古留传下来的曲子并非每个农夫都会唱，只有那些深谙如何激发和维持耕牛干劲的农夫才唱得出来。这个曲子的起源可能是圣歌，以前被认为具有神秘的力量，直到现在人们还认为它能使耕牛无所畏惧，能平息它们的不满，还能排解它们长久干活的厌烦。只懂得怎么驾驭它们耕出笔直的犁沟，懂得如何调整犁头的角度以减轻耕牛的辛苦是不够的。不会给牛唱歌的农夫不是一流的农夫。这是一门特殊的学问，需要特别的品位和力量。</td>
		<td class="en">A child of six or seven years, as beautiful as an angel, with a lamb’s fleece covering his shoulders, over his blouse, so that he resembled the little Saint John the Baptist of the painters of the Renaissance, was trudging along in the furrow beside the plough and pricking the sides of the oxen with a long, light stick, the end of which was armed with a dull goad.The proud beasts quivered under the child’s small hand, and made the yokes and the straps about their foreheads groan, jerking the plough violently forward.When the ploughshare struck a root, the driver shouted in a resonant voice, calling each beast by his name, but rather to soothe than to excite them; for the oxen, annoyed by the sudden resistance, started forward, digging their broad forked feet into the ground, and would have turned aside and dragged the plough across the field, had not the young man held the four leaders in check with voice and goad, while the child handled the other four.He, too, shouted, poor little fellow, in a voice which he tried to render terrible, but which remained as sweet as his angelic face.The whole picture was beautiful in strength and in grace: the landscape, the man, the child, the oxen under the yoke; and, despite the mighty struggle in which the earth was conquered, there was a feeling of peace and profound tranquillity hovering over everything.When the obstacle was surmounted and the team resumed its even, solemn progress, the ploughman, whose pretended violence was only to give his muscles a little practice and his vitality an outlet, suddenly resumed the serenity of simple souls and cast a contented glance upon his child, who turned to smile at him.Then the manly voice of the young paterfamilias would strike up the solemn, melancholy tune which the ancient tradition of the province transmits, not to all ploughmen without distinction, but to those most expert in the art of arousing and sustaining the spirit of working-cattle.That song, whose origin was perhaps held sacred, and to which mysterious influences seem to have been attributed formerly, is reputed even to the present day to possess the virtue of keeping up the courage of those animals, of soothing their discontent, and of whiling away the tedium of their long task.It is not enough to have the art of driving them so as to cut the furrow in an absolutely straight line, to lighten their labor by raising the share or burying it deeper in the ground: a man is not a perfect ploughman if he cannot sing to his cattle, and that is a special science which requires special taste and powers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >准确地说，这首曲子不过是一种可以随意中断、又可以接着唱下去的宣叙曲。它无规则的形式和音调与音乐艺术的规则完全不符，因此无法谱写。但它仍不失为一首妙曲，与它所伴唱的劳动的本质、耕牛的步伐、田野的宁静、唱歌农夫的淳朴完全和谐一致。任何不熟悉耕作的天才都无法创作出这样的曲子，除了当地聪明的农夫外，没有人知道该怎么演唱。在一年里的耕作时节，这种动听又有力的曲子如微风般吟唱，它独特的调子与微风确有相似之处。每个乐句的最后一个词都被强大的气息拖得很长，并提高四分之一音阶，故意制造出不和谐的效果。这种声音听起来粗俗，但是它的魅力却难以形容。一个人听习惯以后会觉得此处同时响起的任何曲子都会破坏这种和谐。</td>
		<td class="en">To speak accurately, this song is only a sort of recitative, broken off and taken up again at pleasure.Its irregular form and its intonations, false according to the rules of musical art, make it impossible to reproduce.But it is a fine song none the less, and so entirely appropriate to the nature of the work it accompanies, to the gait of the ox, to the tranquillity of rural scenes, to the simple manners of the men who sing it, that no genius unfamiliar with work in the fields could have invented it, and no singer other than a cunning ploughman of that region would know how to render it.At the time of year when there is no other work and no other sign of activity in the country than the ploughing, that sweet and powerful chant rises like the voice of the breeze, which it resembles somewhat in its peculiar pitch.The final word of each phrase, sustained at incredible length, and with marvellous power of breath, ascends a fourth of a tone, purposely making a discord.That is barbarous, perhaps, but the charm of it is indescribable, and when one is accustomed to hear it, one cannot conceive of any other song at that time and in those localities that would not disturb the harmony.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以此刻我眼前浮现出一幅与霍尔拜因的作品完全不同的画面，虽然两者可能都是相似的场景。代替那个悲伤老人的是一个满心喜悦的年轻人。代替那一群瘦骨嶙峋、无精打采的马匹的是两队四头健壮而精神高亢的耕牛。代替死神的是一个可爱的孩子。代替绝望和毁灭形象的是充满干劲的劳动场面和幸福的想法。</td>
		<td class="en">It happened, therefore, that I had before my eyes a picture in striking contrast with Holbein’s, although it might be a similar scene.Instead of a sad old man, a cheerful young man; instead of a team of thin, sorry horses, two yoke of four sturdy, spirited cattle; instead of Death, a lovely child; instead of an image of despair and a suggestion of destruction, a spectacle of energetic action and a thought of happiness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时那首法语的四行诗“累得汗流满面”等等和维吉尔的“啊，要是农夫知道他的幸福”同时浮现在我的脑海里。当我看到英俊的年轻人和他漂亮的孩子，优雅而又活力充沛地在如此诗意的环境里从事着一件庄严又伟大的工作时，我感到一种深深的怜悯，其中夹杂着不知不觉的尊敬。农夫是快乐的。是的，我也应该和和他一样，如果我的臂膀和胸膛突然变得强壮有力，我能使土地变得肥沃，我也能歌唱大自然，我的双眼也不会失去观察的能力，我的思想便能懂得色彩和声音的和谐、音调的细腻和委婉回旋的优雅——一句话，倘若如此，我便能懂得事物神秘之美，尤其是我的心仍然能和神圣的情感沟通，正是这种情感主宰着不朽和崇高的创造。</td>
		<td class="en">Then it was that the French quatrain: “A la sueur de ton visaige,” etc., and the O fortunatos—agricolas of Virgil, came to my mind simultaneously, and when I saw that handsome pair, the man and the child, performing a grand and solemn task under such poetic conditions, and with so much grace combined with so much strength, I had a feeling of profound compassion mingled with involuntary respect.Happy the husbandman.Yes, so I should be in his place, if my arm should suddenly become strong and my chest powerful, so that they could thus fertilize nature and sing to her, without my eyes losing the power to see and my brain to understand the harmony of colors and sounds, the delicacy of tones, and the gracefulness of contours,—in a word, the mysterious beauty of things, and, above all, without my heart ceasing to be in relation with the divine sentiment that presided at the immortal and sublime creation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，唉！那个年轻人永远不懂美的神秘，孩子也不会懂！上帝告诫我不要认为他们和他们驾驭的牲畜一样卑贱，他们时不时也会用一种令人欣喜的启示来减轻他们的厌倦，赶走他们的忧虑！我在他们高贵的额头上看见了上帝的印信，比起那些花钱买地的人，他们生来便是土地之王。他们也有同样的感受，那些迫使他们背井离乡的人一定会受到惩罚，他们热爱这片用自己额头上的汗水浇灌的土地；真正的农民就算置身行伍之间，也会因乡愁而客死他乡。但是这个年轻人缺少我所拥有的那部分快乐，那部分非物质的享受。这原本应无可争议地属于他，属于这个浩瀚的天空才能容下的巨大神殿中的工匠。他缺少对自己情感的认识。那些当他还在娘胎里就认定他要被奴役的人们无法剥夺他幻想的能力，却带走了他思考的能力。</td>
		<td class="en">But, alas! that man has never understood the mystery of the beautiful, that child will never understand it!God preserve me from the thought that they are not superior to the animals they guide, and that they have not at times a sort of ecstatic revelation that charms away their weariness and puts their cares to sleep!I see upon their noble brows the seal of the Lord God, for they are born kings of the earth much more truly than they who possess it, because they have paid for it.And the proof that they feel that it is so is found in the fact that you cannot expatriate them with impunity, and that they love the ground watered by the sweat of their brow, that the true peasant dies of homesickness in the uniform of the soldier, far from the fields where he was born.But that man lacks a part of the enjoyments I possess, immaterial enjoyments to which he is abundantly entitled, he the workman in the vast temple which the heavens are vast enough to embrace.He lacks knowledge of his own sentiments.They who condemned him to servitude from his mother’s womb, being unable to take from him the power of reverie, have taken the power of reflection.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Germain,” his father-in-law said to him one day, “you must make up your mind to marry again.It’s almost two years since you lost my daughter, and your oldest boy is seven years old.You’re getting on toward thirty, my boy, and when a man passes that age, you know, in our province, he’s considered too old to begin housekeeping again.You have three fine children, and thus far they haven’t been a trouble to us.My wife and daughter-in-law have looked after them as well as they could, and loved them as they ought.There’s Petit-Pierre, he’s what you might call educated; he can drive oxen very handily already; he knows enough to keep the cattle in the meadow, and he’s strong enough to drive the horses to water.So he isn’t the one to be a burden to us; but the other two—we love them, God knows! poor innocent creatures!—cause us much anxiety this year.My daughter-in-law is about lying-in, and she still has a little one in her arms.When the one we expect has come, she won’t be able to look after your little Solange, and especially your little Sylvain, who isn’t four years old and hardly keeps still a minute day or night.His blood is hot, like yours: he’ll make a good workman, but he’s a terrible child, and my old woman can’t run fast enough now to catch him when he runs off toward the ditch or in among the feet of the cattle.And then, when my daughter-in-law brings this other one into the world, her last but one will be thrown on my wife’s hands for a month, at least.So your children worry us and overburden us.We don’t like to see children neglected; and when you think of the accidents that may happen to them for lack of watching, your mind’s never at rest.So you must have another wife, and I another daughter-in-law.Think it over, my boy.I’ve already warned you more than once; time flies, and the years won’t wait for you.You owe it to your children and to us, who want to have everything go right in the house, to marry as soon as possible.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，爸爸，”女婿回答说，“如果您真想我这样做的话，我怎敢违您的好意。不过，不瞒您说，这可是件烦心事，我情愿去投水，也不想惹这样的麻烦。一个人知道自己失去的是什么样的人，可不知道会找到一个什么样的人。我有过一个好老婆，她漂亮、可爱又勇敢，孝顺父母，疼丈夫和孩子，里外都是一把好手，聪明能干，确实样样都好。您把她许给了我，我娶她的时候，可没有说好如果我不幸失去她的话，我得把她忘掉啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, father,” the son-in-law replied, “if you really want me to do it, I must gratify you.But I don’t propose to conceal from you that it will cause me a great deal of annoyance, and that I’d about as lief drown myself.You know what you’ve lost, and you don’t know what you may find.I had an excellent wife, a good-looking wife, sweet and brave, good to her father and mother, good to her husband, good to her children, a good worker, in the fields or in the house, clever about her work, good at everything, in fact; and when you gave her to me, when I took her, it wasn’t one of the conditions that I should forget her if I had the bad luck to lose her.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“What you say shows a good heart, Germain,” rejoined Père Maurice; “I know you loved my daughter, that you made her happy, and that if you could have satisfied Death by going in her place, Catherine would be alive at this moment and you in the cemetery.She well deserved to have you love her like that, and if you don’t get over her loss, no more do we.But I’m not talking about forgetting her.The good God willed that she should leave us, and we don’t let a day pass without showing Him, by our prayers, our thoughts, our words, our acts, that we respect her memory and are grieved at her departure.But if she could speak to you from the other world and tell you her will, she would bid you seek a mother for her little orphans.The question, then, is to find a woman worthy to take her place.It won’t be very easy; but it isn’t impossible; and when we have found her for you, you will love her as you loved my daughter, because you are an honest man and because you will be grateful to her for doing us a service and loving your children.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“You are right in that, Germain.Jacques is a good son, a good brother, and a man who loves the truth.But Jacques may die before you, before your children are grown up, and one must always have a care not to leave minors without a head to give them good advice and arrange their differences.Otherwise the lawyers interfere, set them at odds with each other, and make them eat everything up in lawsuits.So we ought not to think of bringing another person into our house, man or woman, without saying to ourselves that that person may some day have to direct the conduct and manage the business of thirty or more children, grandchildren, sons-in-law, and daughters-in-law.No one knows how much a family may grow, and when the hive is too full and the time has come to swarm, every one thinks about carrying off his honey.When I took you for my son-in-law, although my daughter was rich and you poor, I never reproached her for choosing you.I saw you were a good worker, and I knew well that the best sort of riches for country people like us is a good pair of arms and a heart like yours.When a man brings those things into a family, he brings enough.But it’s different with a woman: her work in the house is to keep, not to get.Besides, now that you are a father and are looking for a wife, you must remember that your new children, having no sort of claim on the inheritance of your first wife’s children, would be left in want if you should die, unless your wife had some property of her own.And then, it would cost something to feed the children you are going to add to our little colony.If that should fall on us alone, we would take care of them, never fear, and without complaining; but everybody’s comfort would be diminished, and the first children would have to take their share of the privations.When families increase beyond measure, and their means do not increase in proportion, then want comes, however bravely we may struggle against it.This is all I have to say, Germain; think it over, and try to make yourself agreeable to Widow Guérin; for her good management and her crowns will bring us aid for the present and peace of mind for the future.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Germain knew the road as far as Magnier; but he thought that he could shorten it by not taking the avenue of Chanteloube, but going by Presles and La Sépulture, a route which he was not in the habit of taking when he went to the fair.He went astray and lost a little more time before entering the woods; even then he did not enter at the right place, and failed to discover his mistake, so that he turned his back to Fourche and headed much farther up, in the direction of Ardentes.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He was prevented then from taking his bearings by a mist which came with the darkness, one of those autumn evening mists which the white moonlight makes more vague and more deceptive.The great pools of water which abound in the clearings exhaled such dense vapor that when Grise passed through them, they only knew it by the splashing of her feet and the difficulty she had in pulling them out of the mud.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们终于走上了一条笔直平坦的路，到了路的尽头，热尔曼想弄清他们所在的位置，却发现他们迷了路。莫里斯老爹在说路线的时候，曾经告诉过他走出森林以后，要下一段陡坡，穿过一片广阔的草地，两次涉过一条河。他告诉他过河的时候要小心，因为初秋的时候下过几场大雨，河水可能有些深。热尔曼没有看到陡坡，也没有看见草地、河流，只有一片平坦的沼泽，月光下像雪一样白。热尔曼拉住了缰绳，四处找人家，等着过路人，却没有看见任何能给他提示的东西。他随即往回走，又骑着马走进了森林。雾越来越浓，月光完全被遮住了，路很不好走，泥沼很深。有两次小格里斯差点跌倒，沉重的负荷让它失去了勇气。尽管它保持了足够的判断力，不致于撞到树上去，可骑在它身上的人不免碰上巨大的树枝，这些树枝和他们的头一样高，挡住了去路，将他们置于极其危险的境地。一次，热尔曼撞上了树枝，丢掉了帽子，好不容易才找了回来。小皮埃尔已经睡着了，像一根圆木一样倒在他爸爸的双臂里，这样热尔曼便无法管马了。</td>
		<td class="en">When they finally found a straight, level path, and had ridden to the end of it, Germain, upon endeavoring to ascertain where he was, realized that he was lost; for Père Maurice, in describing the road, had told him that, on leaving the woods, he would have to descend a very steep hill, cross a very large meadow, and ford the river twice.He had advised him to be cautious about riding into the river, because there had been heavy rains at the beginning of the season, and the water might be a little high.Seeing no steep hill, no meadow, no river, but the level moor, white as a sheet of snow, Germain drew rein, looked about for a house, waited for some one to pass, but saw nothing to give him any information.Thereupon he retraced his steps, and rode back into the woods.But the mist grew denser, the moon was altogether hidden, the roads were very bad, the ruts deep.Twice Grise nearly fell; laden as she was, she lost courage, and although she retained sufficient discernment to avoid running against trees, she could not prevent her riders from having to deal with huge branches which barred the road at the level of their heads and put them in great danger.Germain lost his hat in one of these encounters, and had great difficulty in finding it.Petit-Pierre had fallen asleep, and, lying back like a log, so embarrassed his father’s arms that he could not hold the mare up or guide her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想我们是中邪了，”热尔曼又一次拉住了缰绳，“这片林子并不大，除非一个人喝醉了酒，否则是不会迷路的。我们在这里都转了两个小时了，就是走不出去。小格里斯的脑袋里只有一个想法，那就是转回家里去，是它让我迷了路。如果我们想回家的话，我们只有靠它认路。可这里或许离我们今晚过夜的地方只有两步路了，要是现在放弃，再走一大段路的话，我们肯定是疯了。不过我现在不知道怎么办好了。我既看不清天空，也看不清脚下，我担心在这个鬼雾里呆久了，孩子会发烧的。还有，万一马失蹄往前倒的话，我们会把孩子压坏的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I believe we’re bewitched,” said Germain, drawing rein once more: “for these woods aren’t big enough for a man to lose himself in unless he’s drunk, and here we have been riding round and round for two hours, unable to get out of them.Grise has only one idea in her head, and that is to go back to the house, and she was the one that made me go astray.If we want to go home, we have only to give her her head.But when we may be within two steps of the place where we are to spend the night, we should be mad to give up finding it, and begin such a long ride over again.But I don’t know what to do.I can’t see either the sky or the ground, and I am afraid this child will take the fever if we stay in this infernal fog, or be crushed by our weight if the horse should fall forward.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“We mustn’t persist in riding any farther,” said little Marie.“Let’s get down, Germain; give me the child; I can carry him very well, and keep him covered up with the cloak better than you can.You can lead the mare, and perhaps we shall see better when we’re nearer the ground.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个权宜之计只能使他们不至于从马上摔下来。雾沿着潮湿的土壤蔓延，像吸在地面上一样。走路很累，他们都筋疲力尽了，终于在一片橡树下找到了一块干的地方，他们停了下来。小玛丽全身都湿了，不过她没抱怨过一句，也不难过。她一心想着孩子。她在沙地上坐了下来，把孩子放在膝头上。热尔曼把小格里斯的缰绳扔在一棵树的树枝上以后便去四周打探。</td>
		<td class="en">That expedient succeeded only so far as to save them from a fall, for the fog crawled along the damp earth and seemed to cling to it.It was very hard walking, and they were so exhausted by it that they stopped when they at last found a dry place under some great oaks.Little Marie was drenched, but she did not complain or seem disturbed.Thinking only of the child, she sat down in the sand and took him on her knees, while Germain explored the neighborhood after throwing Grise’s rein over the branch of a tree.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是小格里斯讨厌透了这次外出，它往后一跳，挣脱了缰绳，弄断了肚带，像致敬一样把前蹄扬得高过头顶，踢了五六下蹶子，然后穿过灌木丛跑了，明摆着是在说它自己不需要任何人的帮助也能找到回家的路。</td>
		<td class="en">But Grise, who was thoroughly disgusted with the journey, jumped back, released the reins, broke the girths, and, kicking up her heels higher than her head some half-dozen times, by way of salutation, started off through the brush, showing very plainly that she needed no one’s assistance in finding her way.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Yes, I am, Germain, I hear what you say,” replied little Marie; “but I am thinking of what my mother has always told me: that a woman of sixty is much to be pitied when her husband is seventy or seventy-five and can’t work any longer to support her.He grows infirm, and she must take care of him at an age when she herself is beginning to have great need of care and rest.That is how people come to end their lives in the gutter.”</td></tr>
