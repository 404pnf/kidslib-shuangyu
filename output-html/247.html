		<td class="en">That is already something.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的母亲雷切尔·博多恩，年收入则在六百英镑左右，自从那个从来都不是很重要的丈夫消失之后，她母亲就一直依靠这笔收入在欧洲各大城市轮流居住。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些年之后，她们两人已经变得更像一对夫妇而不像母女了。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们的确非常了解彼此，而且各自对对方都有些“神经质”。</td>
		<td class="en">They knew one another very well indeed, and each was a little “nervous” of the other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们时聚时散，已有好几次了。</td>
		<td class="en">They had lived together and parted several times.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来，亨利让她失望了：有两个原因。</td>
		<td class="en">Then Henry let her down: for two reasons.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一是他不能容忍她的母亲。</td>
		<td class="en">He couldn’t stand her mother.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >亨利遭到岳母的百般压制，感到十分苦恼。而弗吉尼娅呢，终究还是无可奈何地忠于自己的家族，站在了她母亲这一边。</td>
		<td class="en">So Henry had writhed horribly, feeling his mother-in-law sitting on him tight, and Virginia, after all, in a helpless sort of family loyalty, sitting alongside her mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >弗吉尼娅并不是真的想欺压亨利。</td>
		<td class="en">Virginia didn’t really want to sit on Henry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是当她母亲教唆她时，她便没了主意。</td>
		<td class="en">But when her mother egged her on, she couldn’t help it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为，归根结底她的母亲支配着她，那是一种神秘的女性力量，与父母的权威没有丝毫关系。</td>
		<td class="en">For ultimately, her mother had power over her; a strange female power, nothing to do with parental authority.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >弗吉尼娅早就把父母的权威抛到脑后了。</td>
		<td class="en">Virginia had long thrown parental authority to the winds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，她的母亲拥有另一种更为微妙的支配形式，柔弱却令人毛骨悚然，因此当雷切尔说：让我们制服他吧！</td>
		<td class="en">But her mother had another, much subtler form of domination, female and thrilling, so that when Rachel said: Let’s squash him!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >弗吉尼娅便不得不恶狠狠地、欢欣鼓舞地赶忙加入到这场游戏当中。</td>
		<td class="en">Virginia had to rush wickedly and gleefully to the sport.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而每逢亨利遭到排挤时，他都心知肚明。</td>
		<td class="en">And Henry knew quite well when he was being squashed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，那就是他背弃文尼的原因之一。他称她文尼，博多恩太太对此极为反感，总是纠正他说：“我女儿叫弗吉尼娅——”</td>
		<td class="en">So that was one of his reasons for going back on Vinny.—He called her Vinny, to the superlative disgust of Mrs Bodoin, who always corrected him: My daughter Virginia—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二个原因，还是借用巴尔扎克的话说，弗吉尼娅那时是一文不名。</td>
		<td class="en">The second reason was, again to be Balzacian, that Virginia hadn’t a sou of her own.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >亨利只有可怜的二百五十英镑。</td>
		<td class="en">Henry had a sorry two hundred and fifty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >弗吉尼娅呢，在二十四岁的时候，就已经能挣四百五十英镑了。</td>
		<td class="en">Virginia, at the age of twenty-four, was already earning four hundred and fifty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，那可是她挣的。</td>
		<td class="en">But she was earning them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而亨利靠着他那珍爱的音乐，每年才只能挣大约十二英镑。</td>
		<td class="en">Whereas Henry managed to earn about twelve pounds per annum, by his precious music.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他意识到自己很难再挣得更多。</td>
		<td class="en">He had realized that he would find it hard to earn more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，除非娶一位能养他的妻子，否则，结婚便毫无可能。</td>
		<td class="en">So that marrying, except with a wife who could keep him, was rather out of the question.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >文尼会继承她母亲的财产。</td>
		<td class="en">Vinny would inherit her mother’s money.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，博多恩太太拥有斯芬克斯那样的强健体魄和肌肉组织。</td>
		<td class="en">But then Mrs Bodoin had the health and muscular equipment of the Sphinx.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她会一直活下去，寻觅她可以吞噬的男人，然后吞噬他。</td>
		<td class="en">She would live forever, seeking whom she might devour, and devouring him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >亨利与文尼像夫妻一样，共同生活了两年：而且文尼感觉到他们确实结婚了，只差一个仪式罢了。</td>
		<td class="en">Henry lived with Vinny for two years, in the married sense of the words: and Vinny felt they were married, minus a mere ceremony.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，文尼总是有她母亲作后盾，尽管母亲经常远在巴黎或比亚里茨，但仍然有信件往来。</td>
		<td class="en">But Vinny had her mother always in the background; often as far back as Paris or Biarritz, but still, within letter reach.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母亲甚至在信中也会展开自己的裙子，镇定地打压亨利，而她从未意识到就在那时她淘气的脸上会露出会心的微笑。</td>
		<td class="en">And she never realized the funny little grin that came on her own elvish face when her mother, even in a letter, spread her skirts and calmly sat on Henry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她从没有意识到，在精神上，她也已经迅速又顽皮地挤兑了他：她不能控制自己的行为，就如同潮汐涨落不能摆脱月亮的影响一样。</td>
		<td class="en">She never realized that in spirit she promptly and mischievously sat on him too: she could no more have helped it than the tide can help turning to the moon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她连做梦都没想过他感受到了这一切，而且他那男性的虚荣心受到了极大的羞辱。</td>
		<td class="en">And she did not dream that he felt it, and was utterly mortified in his masculine vanity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女人们通常是互相迷恋，着了迷之后，进而温柔地搂住她们认为自己全心全意爱着的男人的脖子。</td>
		<td class="en">Women, very often, hypnotize one another, and then, hypnotized, they proceed gently to wring the neck of the man they think they are loving with all their hearts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >若是那个男人不喜欢自己的脖子被搂住，她们便称之为彻底反常。</td>
		<td class="en">Then they call it utter perversity on his part, that he doesn’t like having his neck wrung.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们认为他这是在拒绝一份真心真意的爱情。</td>
		<td class="en">They think he is repudiating a heart-felt love.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为她们心醉魂迷了。</td>
		<td class="en">For they are hypnotized.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女人便这么不知不觉地相互迷恋着。</td>
		<td class="en">Women hypnotize one another, without knowing it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终，亨利退出了。</td>
		<td class="en">In the end, Henry backed out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他发现自己被这两个女人贬得一无是处，一个是有着斯芬克斯那样肌肉的老女巫，另一个是着了魔的年轻女巫，她挥霍无度、古灵精怪而软弱无用，她极力地宠着他，却吞噬了他的精髓。</td>
		<td class="en">He saw himself being simply reduced to nothingness by two women, an old witch with muscles like the Sphinx, and a young, spell-bound witch, lavish, elvish and weak, who utterly spoilt him but who ate his marrow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >雷切尔会从巴黎写信来说：我亲爱的弗吉尼娅，由于我在投资方面发了一笔横财，所以我要和你一起分享。</td>
		<td class="en">Rachel would write from Paris: My dear Virginia, as I had a windfall in the way of an investment, I am sharing it with you.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随信附上一张二十英镑的支票。</td>
		<td class="en">You will find enclosed my cheque for twenty pounds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你肯定会需要这笔钱给亨利买一套西服的，因为眼看春天就要到了，阳光很可能会把他的穷酸相都暴露出来的。</td>
		<td class="en">No doubt you will be needing it to buy Henry a suit of clothes, since the spring is apparently come, and the sunlight may be tempted to show him up for what he is worth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我可不想我的女儿和一个像是街头乐手的人到处走动，不过得你自己付裁缝的手工钱，要不然以后还得你再付。——亨利得了一套西装，可那几乎就是一件“内萨斯之衣”，用稀薄的毒液吞噬着他。</td>
		<td class="en">I don’t want my daughter going around with what is presumably a street-corner musician, but please pay the tailor’s bill yourself, or you may have to do it over again later.—Henry got a suit of clothes, but it was as good as a shirt of Nessus, eating him away with subtle poison.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此他退出了。</td>
		<td class="en">So he backed out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他不是在双方剑拔弩张的时候猛然离开、突然溜走，或是夺路而逃。</td>
		<td class="en">He didn’t jump out, or bolt, or carve his way out at the sword’s point.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他应该算是逐渐淡出的，若即若离有一年多才彻底离开的。</td>
		<td class="en">He sort of faded out, distributing his departure over a year or more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他喜欢文尼，简直离不开她，他也对她感到歉疚。</td>
		<td class="en">He was fond of Vinny, and he could hardly do without her, and he was sorry for her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但最终他看出她不能离开她母亲。</td>
		<td class="en">But at length he couldn’t see her apart from her mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是个年轻、软弱、爱挥霍浪费的女巫，是她那个手段强硬、巫婆般母亲的帮凶。</td>
		<td class="en">She was a young, weak, spendthrift witch, accomplice of her tough-clawed witch of a mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >亨利与其他人确定了关系，在别处找到了立足之地，从而渐渐地解救了自己。</td>
		<td class="en">Henry made other alliances, got a good hold on elsewhere, and gradually extricated himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他拯救了自己的生命，可是他感到,自己浪费了许多青春和精力。</td>
		<td class="en">He saved his life, but he had lost, he felt, a good deal of his youth and marrow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在他开始发胖，变得有点儿臃肿，有点儿不起眼了。</td>
		<td class="en">He tended now to go fat, a little puffy, somewhat insignificant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可他曾经帅气英俊、引人注目。</td>

		<td class="en">The two witches howled when he was lost to them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可怜的弗吉尼娅真的半疯半癫了，她不知道如何是好。</td>
		<td class="en">Poor Virginia was really half crazy, she didn’t know what to do with herself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她对母亲怀着一种强烈的抵触情绪。</td>
		<td class="en">She had a violent recoil from her mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而博多恩太太对女儿充满了强烈的鄙视：她竟然让这样一条上了钩的鱼从她手里溜掉了！她竟然让这样的一个人把她给抛弃了！——“我真搞不懂我的女儿是怎么被亨利·卢伯克这样的寄生虫引诱然后抛弃的！”她写道，</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs Bodoin was filled with furious contempt for her daughter: that she should let such a hooked fish slip out of her hands! that she should allow such a person to turn her down!—“I don’t quite see my daughter seduced and thrown over by a sponging individual such as Henry Lubbock,” she wrote.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是既然事情已经发生了，我想这就是某个人的过错——”</td>
		<td class="en">“But if it has happened, I suppose it is somebody’s fault—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母女间的相互抵触持续了将近五年。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a mutual recoil, which lasted nearly five years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是那种魔力并未消散。</td>
		<td class="en">But the spell was not broken.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >博多恩太太的心思从来没离开过女儿，而弗吉尼娅也总是意识到她的母亲就在宇宙中的某个地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs Bodoin’s mind never left her daughter, and Virginia was ceaselessly aware of her mother, somewhere in the universe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们互通书信，时不时地也见见面，可是她们在逃避中保持着距离。</td>
		<td class="en">They wrote, and met at intervals, but they kept apart in recoil.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，这种魔力仍旧存在于她们之间，并渐渐地产生了作用。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们感到更亲近些了。</td>
		<td class="en">They felt more friendly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >博多恩太太来到了伦敦。</td>
		<td class="en">Mrs Bodoin came to London.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她和女儿住在同一家清静的旅馆里：过去三年来，弗吉尼娅在旅馆里一直租着两个房间。</td>
		<td class="en">She stayed in the same quiet hotel with her daughter: Virginia had had two rooms in a hotel for the past three years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终，她们想要一起租一套寓所。</td>
		<td class="en">And, at last, they thought of taking an apartment together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >弗吉尼娅如今三十多了。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她仍旧瘦弱、古怪而淘气，她的一只棕色的眼睛中略微投射出逗人喜爱的目光，脸上依旧露出古怪而扭曲的微笑，舒缓而低沉的声音如同细俏指尖般抚摸着男人。</td>
		<td class="en">She was still thin and odd and elvish, with a very slight and piquant cast in one of her brown eyes, and she still had her odd, twisted smile, and her slow, rather deep-toned voice, that caressed a man like the stroking of subtle finger-tips.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她依旧是一头自然卷发，略微有些凌乱。</td>
		<td class="en">Her hair was still a natural tangle of curls, a bit dishevelled.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">She still dressed with a natural elegance which tended to go wrong and a tiny bit sluttish.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她那昂贵全新的长筒袜上仍旧会有个破洞，而她一到客厅喝茶，依旧会脱掉鞋子，穿着长筒袜坐在那里。</td>
		<td class="en">She still might have a hole in her expensive and perfectly new stockings, and still she might have to take off her shoes in the drawing-room, if she came to tea, and sit there in her stockinged-feet.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was neither coquetry nor vanity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >原因很简单，她曾找了一位手艺精湛的鞋匠，花了五个几尼定做了一双非常简朴、自然、合脚的鞋，可是当她穿着这双鞋走上半英里，鞋就夹得她异常难受，她就只能脱下这鞋，甚至是坐在路边镶边石上也要脱掉它。</td>
		<td class="en">It was simply that, after having gone to a good shoemaker and paid five guineas for a pair of perfectly simple and natural shoes, made to her feet, the said shoes would hurt her excruciatingly, when she had walked half a mile in them, and she would simply have to take them off, even if she sat on the kerb to do it.</td></tr>
