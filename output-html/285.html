		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这天傍晚，我从新闻审查处出来，步行回我住的佛罗里达旅店，当时天正下着雨。我走了将近一半路的时候，因为实在讨厌这样的雨天，所以就拐进奇科特酒吧，打算喝一杯就走。这是马德里被围攻遭遇炮轰的第二个冬天，什么都缺，包括烟草和人们的好脾气，肚子总是有点饿，遇到一些无能为力的事，比如说坏天气，就会突然发起无名火来。我应该回家的。只剩五个街区了，可是看见奇科特酒吧的门，我就想进去喝一杯，喝完就走，踩着炮轰后满是泥泞和碎石的街道，走完格兰维亚大道上的那六条街区。</td>
		<td class="en">On this evening I was walking home from the censorship office to the Florida Hotel and it was raining.So about halfway home I got sick of the rain and stopped into Chicote’s for a quick one.It was the second winter of shelling in the siege of Madrid and everything was short including tobacco and people’s tempers and you were a little hungry all the time and would become suddenly and unreasonably irritated at things you could do nothing about such as the weather.I should have gone on home.It was only five blocks more, but when I saw Chicote’s doorway I thought I would get a quick one and then do those six blocks up the Gran Via through the mud and rubble of the streets broken by the bombardment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那地方很拥挤。你连柜台边都挤不过去，所有的桌子旁都挤满了人。酒吧里烟雾缭绕，歌声不断，里面到处都是穿军装的人，还有淋湿的皮上衣的味道，柜台前面的人围了有三层，酒只能从人群头顶递出来。</td>
		<td class="en">The place was crowded.You couldn’t get near the bar and all the tables were full.It was full of smoke, singing, men in uniform, and the smell of wet leather coats, and they were handing drinks over a crowd that was three deep at the bar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个我认识的侍者从另一个桌子旁帮我找了把椅子，我坐下来，同坐一桌的有一个脸白白的、喉结突起的、瘦瘦的德国人，这个人我知道，他在新闻审查处工作，另外两个人不认识。桌子就在酒吧的中间，进门后稍微靠右一点。</td>
		<td class="en">A waiter I knew found a chair from another table and I sat down with a thin, white-faced, Adam’s-appled German I knew who was working at the censorship and two other people I did not know.The table was in the middle of the room a little on your right as you go in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >歌声太大，连自己说话都听不见，我要了杯杜松子酒加安古斯图拉，喝下去好解解雨的潮气。这地方真是塞满了人，每个人都很快活；他们大多喝的是新酿的加泰罗尼亚酒，喝得有点开心过头了。有两个我不认识的人拍了拍我的后背，同桌的那个姑娘跟我说了些什么，我听不到，就说：“当然可以。”</td>
		<td class="en">You couldn’t hear yourself talk for the singing and I ordered a gin and Angostura and put it down against the rain.The place was really packed and everybody was very jolly; maybe getting just a little bit too jolly from the newly made Catalan liquor most of them were drinking.A couple of people I did not know slapped me on the back and when the girl at our table said something to me, I couldn’t hear it and said, “Sure.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我不再四处张望，回过头来看我们这一桌时，发现那个姑娘长得太难看了，真的很难看。不过等侍者过来的时候，我才弄明白她跟我说的是要喝一杯。跟她一起的那个家伙的长相并不能给人留下深刻印象，不过那姑娘的长相倒是足以给人留下深刻印象，连她的同伴也忘不了。她长着一张刚硬的脸，还带着几分威严，生来就像一个训狮者；跟她一起的那个小伙子看上去似乎应该系一条校友领带。不过他不是那样打扮的。他跟我们大家都一样，穿着一件皮上衣。只是他的并不湿，因为下雨前他们已经在这里了。她也穿着件皮上衣，这倒是跟她的长相很相称。</td>
		<td class="en">She was pretty terrible looking now I had stopped looking around and was looking at our table; really pretty terrible.But it turned out, when the waiter came, that what she had asked me was to have a drink.The fellow with her was not very forceful looking but she was forceful enough for both of them.She had one of those strong, semi-classical faces and was built like a lion tamer; and the boy with her looked as though he ought to be wearing an old school tie.He wasn’t though.He was wearing a leather coat just like all the rest of us.Only it wasn’t wet because they had been there since before the rain started.She had on a leather coat too and it was becoming to the sort of face she had.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时候我多希望我没半路拐进奇科特酒吧，而是直接回家，回了家可以换换衣服，干干爽爽的，躺在床上，翘起脚，舒舒服服地喝一杯，好过在这里看着这两个年轻人，实在是没意思。人生很短暂，看着丑女人却过得很漫长，我坐在桌旁，下了决心，即使我是个作家，应该对各色人物都抱有很大的好奇心，可是对于这两个人，我一点儿都不想知道他们是否结婚，彼此看重对方什么，他们的政治见解如何，男的或女的是否有点钱财，或是任何有关他们的事情。我肯定他们是在电台工作。在马德里，只要看到长相特别奇特的非军职人员，必定是在电台工作。于是为了说点什么，我提高嗓门，盖过周围的噪音，问道：“你们在电台工作？”</td>
		<td class="en">By this time I was wishing I had not stopped into Chicote’s but had gone straight on home where you could change your clothes and be dry and have a drink in comfort on the bed with your feet up, and I was tired of looking at both of these young people.Life is very short and ugly women are very long and sitting there at the table I decided that even though I was a writer and supposed to have an insatiable curiosity about all sorts of people, I did not really care to know whether these two were married, or what they saw in each other, or what their politics were, or whether he had a little money, or she had a little money, or anything about them.I decided they must be in the radio.Any time you saw really strange looking civilians in Madrid they were always in the radio.So to say something I raised my voice above the noise and asked, “You in the radio?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对啊。”那姑娘说。果然是这样。他们在电台工作。</td>
		<td class="en">“We are,” the girl said.So that was that.They were in the radio.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“同志，你怎么样？”我对那个德国人说。</td>
		<td class="en">“How are you comrade?” I said to the German.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很好。你呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Fine.And you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“湿淋淋的。”我说道。他头一偏，笑了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Wet,” I said, and he laughed with his head on one side.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你有香烟吗？”他问。我把我倒数第二包香烟递给他，他拿了两支。那个长相奇特的姑娘拿了两支，那个长得像是脖子里系着条校友领带的小伙子拿了一支。</td>
		<td class="en">“You haven’t got a cigarette?” he asked.I handed him my next to the last pack of cigarettes and he took two.The forceful girl took two and the young man with the old school tie face took one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再拿一支吧。”我大声喊。</td>
		<td class="en">“Take another,” I shouted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不用了，谢谢。”他回答，那个德国人却接了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">“No thanks,” he answered and the German took it instead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你介意吗？”他笑着说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you mind?” he smiled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然不介意。”我说。其实我是很介意的，他也知道。不过他太需要香烟了，也就不在乎这些了。歌声偶尔会停下来，有时候会像暴风雨一样出现停顿，这时候我们就能听见彼此说话了。“你都已经在这里呆很长时间了？”那个长相奇特的姑娘问我。她把“都”发成了“豆汤”的“豆”的音。</td>
		<td class="en">“Of course not.” I said.I really minded and he knew it.But he wanted the cigarettes so badly that it did not matter.The singing had died down momentarily, or there was a break in it as there is sometimes in a storm, and we could all hear what we said.“You been here long?” the forceful girl asked me.She pronounced it bean as in bean soup.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“时走时来。”我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Off and on,” I said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们得认真谈谈，”那个德国人说，“我想和你谈谈。什么时候可以呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“We must have a serious talk,” the German said.“I want to have a talk with you.When can we have it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我给你打电话吧。”我说。这人真是个古怪的德国人，没有哪个正派的德国人喜欢他。他活在自己的幻觉中，以为自己会弹钢琴，不过只要让他离钢琴远点，他还算不错，但是千万别让他喝酒，或是有机会闲聊，可是还没有人能让他离了这两条。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll call you up,” I said.This German was a very strange German indeed and none of the good Germans liked him.He lived under the delusion that he could play the piano, but if you kept him away from pianos he was all right unless he was exposed to liquor, or the opportunity to gossip, and nobody had even been able to keep him away from those two things yet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说长道短是他最拿手的，只要你提到不管是马德里、巴伦西亚、巴塞罗那，还是什么其他政治中心的某个人，他总有关于这个人的最新消息，而且是最有损名声的消息。</td>
		<td class="en">Gossip was the best thing he did and he always knew something new and highly discreditable about anyone you could mention in Madrid, Valencia, Barcelona, and other political centers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时候歌声又响起了，总不能扯着嗓子说些小道消息吧，所以这天下午在奇科特酒吧就只能是一个沉闷的下午了，我拿定主意等回请过一轮之后就赶快走。</td>
		<td class="en">Just then the singing really started in again, and you cannot gossip very well shouting, so it looked like a dull afternoon at Chicote’s and I decided to leave as soon as I should have bought a round myself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时有事发生了。有一个老百姓，身穿棕色套装、白色衬衫、黑色领带，头发从奇高的前额向后直梳，一直在沿桌扮小丑，这时又用一个喷雾器向一个侍者喷去。大家都笑了，除了那个侍者，当时他手里正端着一个摆满了酒的托盘。他气坏了。</td>
		<td class="en">Just then it started.A civilian in a brown suit, a white shirt, black tie, his hair brushed straight back from a rather high forehead, who had been clowning around from table to table, squirted one of the waiters with a flit gun.Everybody laughed except the waiter who was carrying a tray full of drinks at the time.He was indignant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“No hay derecho.”侍者说。意思是：“你没有权利这么做。”这在西班牙是最简单也是最强烈的抗议。</td>
		<td class="en">“No hay derecho,” the waiter said.This means, “You have no right to do that,” and is the simplest and the strongest protest in Spain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个手拿喷雾器的男人为自己的成功有点得意忘形，似乎没有意识到这样的事实：眼下已是战争的第二个年头，他正身处围城，这里每个人都处于神经紧张的状态，酒吧里算他在内只有四个人是老百姓的穿着。现在他又转向另一个侍者喷去。</td>
		<td class="en">The flit gun man, delighted with his success, and not seeming to give any importance to the fact that it was well into the second year of the war, that he was in a city under siege where everyone was under a strain, and that he was one of only four men in civilian clothes in the place, now squirted another waiter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我四处张望，想找个地方躲躲。这个侍者也很生气，而那个喷雾器男人又毫不在意地喷了他两次。有的人还觉得好笑，那个长相奇特的姑娘就是其中一个。但是那个侍者站在那里，摇着头。他的嘴唇在颤抖。他已经上了年纪，据我所知他已经在奇科特酒吧干了十年了。</td>
		<td class="en">I looked around for a place to duck to.This waiter, also, was indignant and the flit gun man squirted him twice more, lightheartedly.Some people still thought it was funny, including the forceful girl.But the waiter stood, shaking his head.His lips were trembling.He was an old man and he had worked in Chicote’s for ten years that I knew of.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你没这样的权利。”他神情严肃地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“No hay derecho,” he said with dignity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >笑的人仍然在笑，然而那个喷雾器男人没有注意到歌声已经渐渐消散，还在拿喷雾器对着一个侍者的脖子后面喷。那个侍者转过身，手里拿着托盘。</td>
		<td class="en">People had laughed, however, and the flit gun man, not noticing how the singing had fallen off, squirted his flit gun at the back of a waiter’s neck.The waiter turned, holding his tray.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你没权利这样做。”他说。这次不是抗议。这次是控诉，我看见三个穿军装的男人从一张桌子旁站起来，向那个喷雾器男人走去，接下来四个人都冲出了旋转门，然后听见啪的一声，有人给了那个喷雾器男人一个嘴巴。还有人捡起了那个喷雾器，紧随着他把它扔出了门。</td>
		<td class="en">“No hay derecho,” he said.This time it was no protest.It was an indictment and I saw three men in uniform start from a table for the flit gun man and the next thing all four of them were going out the revolving door in a rush and you heard a smack when someone hit the flit gun man on the mouth.Somebody else picked up the flit gun and threw it out the door after him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那三个人回到酒吧里，表情严肃而强悍，一派正气凌然的样子。接着门又转了一下，进来的是那个喷雾器男人。他的头发垂下来披在眼睛上，脸上有血，领带也被扯到一边，衬衣被撕开了。他双眼圆睁，脸色苍白，推门进来的时候手上又拿着那个喷雾器，对着满店的人，存心挑衅似的，也不瞄准，就喷了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">The three men came back in looking serious, tough and very righteous.Then the door revolved and in came the flit gun man.His hair was down in his eyes, there was blood on his face, his necktie was pulled to one side and his shirt was torn open.He had the flit gun again and as he pushed, wild-eyed and white-faced, into the room he made one general, unaimed, challenging squirt with it, holding it toward the whole company.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我看见那三个人里有一个朝他冲过去，也看见了那人的脸。随后又有几个人和他一起，把那个喷雾器男人往后推到两张桌子中间，就在进门后店堂的左边，那个喷雾器男人一直在拼命地挣扎，枪响的时候，我拉住那个长相奇特的姑娘，拽住她的胳膊往厨房门冲去。</td>
		<td class="en">I saw one of the three men start for him and I saw this man’s face.There were more men with him now and they forced the flit gun man back between two tables on the left of the room as you go in, the flit gun man struggling wildly now, and when the shot went off I grabbed the forceful girl by the arm and dove for the kitchen door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >厨房门关着，我用肩膀顶也没有顶开。</td>
		<td class="en">The kitchen door was shut and when I put my shoulder against it  did not give.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在柜台角落趴下吧。”我说。她跪在那里。</td>
		<td class="en">“Get down here behind the angle of the bar,” I said.She knelt there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“卧倒。”我说着把她按了下去。她气坏了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Flat,” I said and pushed her down.She was furious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >店里的每个男人都掏出了枪，除了那个卧倒在一张桌子后面的德国人，还有那个靠墙站在角落里的英国公学毕业生模样的小伙子。靠墙的一张长登上站着三个金发女郎，金发颜色太过火了，发根却还是黑色的，她们踮着脚想看清楚，还不停地尖叫着。</td>
		<td class="en">Every man in the room except the German, who lay behind a table, and the public-school-looking boy who stood in a corner drawn up against the wall, had a gun up.On a bench along the wall three over-blonde girls, their hair dark at the roots, were standing on tiptoe to see and screaming steadily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不怕，”那个长相奇特的姑娘说，“真是荒唐。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m not afraid,” the forceful one said.“This is ridiculous.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你大概不想在酒吧斗殴中吃枪子吧，”我说，“要是这个喷雾器男人有朋友在这的话就更糟了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You don’t want to get shot in a café brawl,” I said.“If that flit king has any friends here this can be very bad.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，显然他没有朋友在这，因为人们开始把枪收起来了，有人把尖叫的金发女郎抱了下了，原本枪声响起的时候冲过去的人都退了回来，只剩那个喷雾器男人仰面躺在地上，没有了声息。</td>
		<td class="en">But he had no friends, evidently, because people began putting their pistols away and somebody lifted down the blonde screamers and everyone who had started over there when the shot came drew back away from the flit man who lay, quietly, on his back on the floor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“警察来之前谁都不准走。”门口有人喊。</td>
		<td class="en">“No one is to leave until the police come,” someone shouted from the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个带着步枪的警察从街头巡逻队过来，正站在门口，这样一宣布，我看见六个男人像橄榄球队的队员一样经过商量之后列队走出门去。其中三个就是第一次把喷雾大王扔出去的那三个人。其中一个就是朝他开枪的那个人。他们径直从那两个带着步枪的警察中间穿过，就像来了个漂亮的掩护，拦住对方的阻截球员迅速穿过去一样。他们刚一出门，有一个警察就拿起步枪拦住门口，嚷道：“没人能离开。谁也不行。”</td>
		<td class="en">Two policemen with rifles, who had come in off the street patrol, were standing by the door and at this announcement I saw six men form up just like the line-up of a football team coming out of a huddle and head out through the door.Three of them were the men who had first thrown the flit king out.One of them was the man who shot him.They went right through the policemen with the rifles like good interference taking out an end and a tackle.And as they went out one of the policemen got his rifle across the door and shouted, “No one can leave.Absolutely no one.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那些人为什么走了？既然有人走了为什么还扣着我们？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why did those men go?Why hold us if anyone’s gone?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们是机械师，必须赶回机场去。”有人说。</td>
		<td class="en">“They were mechanics who had to return to their air field,” someone said.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“No it’s not.It’s simply horrible.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时我们已经站起来了，她正气愤地盯着喷雾大王躺着的地方。他的胳膊伸展着，一条腿屈起。</td>

		<td class="en">“Because he’s dead,” I said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >警察来了以后把所有人都扣留了三个小时。他们开始是用鼻子闻每一把手枪。这样他们可以查出哪把枪刚开过火。闻了将近四十把枪以后，他们似乎厌倦了，反正闻到的都是淋湿的皮上衣的味道。然后他们在死去的喷雾大王的后边摆了一张桌子，坐在那里查验人们的证件，喷雾大王躺在地上，看上去就像他自己的一个雕刻拙劣的灰色蜡像，一双灰色的蜡像手，还有一张灰色的蜡像脸。</td>
		<td class="en">When the police came they held everybody there for three hours.They commenced by smelling of all the pistols.In this manner they would detect one which had been fired recently.After about forty pistols they seemed to get bored with this and anyway all you could smell was wet leather coats.Then they sat at a table placed directly behind the late flit king, who lay on the floor looking like a grey wax caricature of himself, with grey wax hands and a grey wax face, and examined people’s papers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的衬衣被扯开了，能看出他没有穿贴身内衣，他的鞋底也快磨穿了。他躺在地上，看上去那么小，那么可怜。两个便衣警察坐在桌子旁查验所有人的身份证件，而要走到那张桌子跟前就得从他身上跨过去。那个男的由于紧张，反复几次把证件丢了又找出来。他是有一张安全通行证，可是却错放到另一个口袋，他就一直找，找得满头大汗才找到。接着他换了个口袋放，结果又得重新找。他找得浑身冒汗，头发都打卷了，脸也涨得通红。这会儿他看起来不只该系一条校友领带，还该再戴上一顶低年级学生戴的小学童帽。以前听过磨难使人老。那么，这次开枪事件让他看起来年轻了十岁。</td>
		<td class="en">With his shirt ripped open you could see the flit king had no undershirt and the soles of his shoes were worn through.He looked very small and pitiful lying there on the floor.You had to step over him to get to the table where two plain clothes policemen sat and examined everyone’s identification papers.The husband lost and found his papers several times with nervousness.He had a safe conduct pass somewhere but he had mislaid it in a pocket and he kept on searching and perspiring until he found it.Then he would put it in a different pocket and have to go searching again.He perspired heavily while doing this and it made his hair very curly and his face red.He now looked as though he should have not only an old school tie but one of those little caps boys in the lower forms wear.You have heard how events age people.Well, this shooting had made him look about ten years younger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们等着的时候，我告诉那个长相奇特的姑娘，这整件事情是个很好的小说材料，改天我要写出来。那六个人排成一列纵队冲出门的情景真是令人印象深刻。她震惊了，她说我不能写，因为这样对西班牙共和国的伟大事业不利。我说我在西班牙呆了很长一段时间了，在君主统治时期巴伦西亚地区开枪伤人的事件异常之多，在共和国之前安达卢西亚人用一种叫拿伐哈的大刀互相砍杀了几百年，在战争期间我在奇科特酒吧看见一场滑稽的开枪伤人事件，就可以把它写出来，就好比这事发生在纽约、芝加哥、基韦斯特、马赛一样。这跟政治无关。她说我不该写。也许其他很多人也认为我不该写。不过那个德国人似乎认为这是个很好的题材，我把最后几支骆驼烟给他了。那么，不管怎样，大概三个小时之后警察终于说我们可以离开了。</td>
		<td class="en">While we were waiting around I told the forceful girl I thought the whole thing was a pretty good story and that I would write it sometime.The way the six had lined up in single file and rushed that door was very impressive.She was shocked and said that I could not write it because it would be prejudicial to the cause of the Spanish Republic.I said that I had been in Spain for a long time and that they used to have a phenomenal number of shootings in the old days around Valencia under the monarchy, and that for hundreds of years before the Republic people had been cutting each other with large knives called navajas in Andalucia, and that if I saw a comic shooting in Chicote’s during the war I could write about it just as though it had been in New York, Chicago, Key West or Marseilles.It did not have anything to do with politics.She said I shouldn’t.Probably a lot of other people will say I shouldn’t too.The German seemed to think it was a pretty good story, however, and I gave him the last of the Camels.Well, anyway, finally, after about three hours the police said we could go.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >佛罗里达旅店的人们都有点为我担心，因为那段日子里，常有炮轰，步行回家的话，如果到七点半酒吧打烊的时候还没到家，那人们就要担心了。到家了我很高兴，趁我们一起在电炉上做晚饭的时候，我给大家讲了这件事，讲得很成功。</td>
		<td class="en">They were sort of worried about me at the Florida because in those days, with the shelling, if you started for home on foot and didn’t get there after the bars were closed at seven-thirty, people worried.I was glad to get home and I told the story while we were cooking supper on an electric stove and it had quite a success.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哦，晚上雨停了，第二天早上，天空晴朗明亮，是个寒冷的初冬天气，十二点四十五分，我推开了奇科特酒吧的旋转门，想在午饭前喝点杜松子酒加奎宁水。这个时间店里人很少，两个侍者和经理来到桌子前面。他们都笑着。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, it stopped raining during the night, and the next morning it was a fine, bright, cold early winter day and at twelve forty-five I pushed open the revolving doors at Chicote’s to try a little gin and tonic before lunch.There were very few people there at that hour and two waiters and the manager came over to the table.They were all smiling.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“It was really just gaiety.No one should have taken offense,” the manager said.“Poor fellow.”“I see,” I said.“He just wanted everyone to have a good time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，”经理说，“其实是个不幸的误会。”</td>

		<td class="en">“She dropped down by him and said, ‘Pedro, what have they done to thee, Pedro?Who has done this to thee?Oh, Pedro.’”“Then the police had to take her away because she could not control herself,” the waiter said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他好像是肺不好，”经理说，“运动开始的时候他还参加过战斗呢。听说他在山里战斗过，可是因为肺不好就没能继续参加战斗。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It seems he was feeble of the chest,” the manager said.“He fought in the first days of the movement.They said he fought in the Sierra but he was too weak in the chest to continue.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“昨天下午他出门进城了，来给大家鼓鼓劲吧。”我猜测。</td>
		<td class="en">“And yesterday afternoon he just went out on the town to cheer things up,” I suggested.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是，”经理说，“你看，真是很稀奇。一切都稀奇极了。这是我从警察那里知道的，只要有充足的时间，他们还是很有效率的。他们询问了他干活的那个工厂的同志。这是他们从他口袋里的工会证得到的信息。昨天他买了那支喷雾器和古龙水，是为了参加婚礼的时候逗个乐子。他也透露过这个意图。他就在街对面买的这些东西。古龙水瓶子上的标签上写着地址。瓶子就在洗手间。他就是在那里灌喷雾器的。一定是买完东西以后，天下雨了，他就进我们酒吧里了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” said the manager.“You see it is very rare.Everything is muy raro.This I learn from the police who are very efficient if given time.They have interrogated comrades from the shop where he worked.This they located from the card of his syndicate which was in his pocket.Yesterday he bought the flit gun and agua de colonia to use for a joke at a wedding.He had announced this intention.He bought them across the street.There was a label on the cologne bottle with the address.The bottle was in the wash room.It was there he filled the flit gun.After buying them he must have come in here when the rain started.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我还记得他进来的时候呢，”一个侍者说，</td>
		<td class="en">“I remember when he came in,” a waiter said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在欢乐的气氛中，歌声弥漫，他也快活起来了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“In the gaiety, with the singing, he became gay too.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是够快活的，”我说，“他几乎飘起来了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He was gay all right,” I said.“He was practically floating around.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >经理继续他的不间断的西班牙式逻辑。</td>
		<td class="en">The manager kept on with the relentless Spanish logic.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“肺不好的人喝了酒才快活成这样。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“That is the gaiety of drinking with a weakness of the chest,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不怎么喜欢这个故事。”我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t like this story very well,” I said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听着，”经理说，“太稀奇了。他的快活碰上这么严肃的战争，就像一只蝴蝶——”“哦，很像一只蝴蝶，”我说，“太像蝴蝶了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Listen,” said the manager.“How rare it is.His gaiety comes in contact with the seriousness of the war like a butterfly—” “Oh, very like a butterfly,” I said.“Too much like a butterfly.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不是在开玩笑，”经理说，“你明白吗？就像一只蝴蝶与一辆坦克。”这让他大为得意。他是在钻研地道的西班牙玄学。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am not joking,” said the manager.“You see it?Like a butterfly and a tank.”This pleased him enormously.He was getting into the real Spanish metaphysics.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喝一杯吧，小店请客，”他说，“你一定得写篇关于这事的小说。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Have a drink on the house,” he said.“You must write a story about this.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我想起了那个手拿喷雾器的男人的那双灰色的蜡像手，那张灰色的蜡像脸，胳膊伸展着，腿曲着，确实有点像蝴蝶，可是也不太像，你知道的。不过他看起来也不像人样。他更能让我想到一只死麻雀。</td>
		<td class="en">I remembered the flit gun man with his grey wax hands and his grey wax face, his arms spread wide and his legs drawn up and he did look a little like a butterfly; not too much, you know.But he did not look very human either.He reminded me more of a dead sparrow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我要杜松子酒加施韦珀奎宁水。”我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ll take gin and Schweppes quinine tonic water,” I said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你一定得写一篇关于这事的小说，”经理说，“来。祝你好运。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You must write a story about it,” the manager said.“Here.Here’s luck.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好运，”我说，“可是你看，昨晚一个英国姑娘跟我说我不该把这事写出来。说这对伟大事业不利。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Luck,” I said.“Look, an English girl last night told me I shouldn’t write about it.That it would be very bad for the cause.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真荒谬，”经理说，“这事很有趣也很有意义，被误解的快乐碰上了长期笼罩在这里的死一般的严肃气氛。对我来说，这是我一段时间以来见过的最稀奇、最有趣的事情了。你一定得写写。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What nonsense,” the manager said.“It is very interesting and important, the misunderstood gaiety coming in contact with the deadly seriousness that is here always.To me it is the rarest and most interesting thing which I have seen for some time.You must write it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，”我说，“我一定写。他有孩子吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“All right,” I said.“Sure.Has he any children?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有，”他说，“我问过警察。可是你一定得写写，而且题目一定得叫《蝴蝶与坦克》。”“好吧，”我说，“一定写。不过我不怎么喜欢这个题目。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” he said.“I asked the police.But you must write it and you must call it ‘The Butterfly and the Tank.’” “All right,” I said.“Sure.But I don’t like the title much.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这题目多优美呀，”经理说，“是纯粹的文学。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The title is very elegant,” the manager said.“It is pure literature.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，”我说，“就这么办。就叫这个题目吧。《蝴蝶与坦克》。”在这个晴朗明快的早上，酒吧里空气清新、洁净，散发着刚打扫干净的味道，我和经理坐在那里，他是我的老朋友，此刻正得意于我们一起酝酿的文学作品，我啜了一口加奎宁水的杜松子酒，望向堆着沙袋的窗户外边，想起了那人的妻子跪倒在那里说过的话：“佩德罗。佩德罗，是谁害了你呀，佩德罗？”我想，即使警察查出是谁扣动的扳机，也永远不会告诉她了。</td>
		<td class="en">“All right,” I said.“Sure.That’s what we’ll call it.‘The Butterfly and the Tank.’”And I sat there on that bright cheerful morning, the place smelling clean and newly aired and swept, with the manager who was an old friend and who was now very pleased with the literature we were making together and I took a sip of the gin and tonic water and looked out the sandbagged window and thought of the wife kneeling there and saying, “Pedro.Pedro, who has done this to thee, Pedro?”And I thought that the police would never be able to tell her that even if they had the name of the man who pulled the trigger.</td></tr>
