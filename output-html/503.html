		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At length he hit upon a plan, and spoke to the King: “All the things she has about her—tables, chairs, dishes, goblets, bowls, and all her household furniture—are made of gold.</td>
		<td class="en">最后，他终于想到了一个计划，并对国王说：“她周围所有的东西都是金子做的：桌子、凳子、盘子、酒杯、碗和一切家庭用具都是金质的。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">等这些珍玩装满了一艘船后，忠实的约翰把自己伪装成了商人，国王也不得不如此，这样他们就不会被认出来了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the Princess of the Golden Roof dwelt.</td>
		<td class="en">就这样，他们漂洋过海，一直航行，直到到达了金屋顶公主居住的城镇。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But Trusty John said: “I am only the servant of a rich merchant, what I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship; his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before.”</td>
		<td class="en">可忠实的约翰说：“我只是一位富商的仆人，现在我有的这些和我主人放在船上的比起来，根本算不了什么。他的商品比之前用金子做成的任何东西都要精美昂贵。”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then Trusty John was quite delighted, and brought her to the ship; and the King, when he beheld her, saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture, and thought every moment that his heart would burst.</td>
		<td class="en">于是，忠实的约翰欣喜不已，把公主带到了船上。当国王看到她，发现她甚至比画像上还美时，觉得自己的心时刻都会从胸膛迸出来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >She stepped on to the ship, and the King led her inside.</td>
		<td class="en">她刚踏上了船，国王便领着她进去了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But Trusty John remained behind with the steersman, and ordered the ship to push off.</td>
		<td class="en">但是忠实的约翰一直呆在船尾和舵手一起，并命令他马上起航离开。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Spread all sail, that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air.”</td>
		<td class="en">“张满所有风帆，让我们在海上飞翔，就像鸟儿在空中飞行一样。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Meanwhile the King showed the Princess inside all his gold wares, every single bit of it—dishes, goblets, bowls, the birds and game, and all the wonderful beasts.</td>
		<td class="en">与此同时，国王在船舱里向公主展示他所有的金器，一件也没落下——碟子、酒杯、游戏用具和奇珍异兽等。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Many hours passed thus, and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away.</td>
		<td class="en">数小时过去了，她太开心了以至于根本没有注意到船已经起航离开了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >After she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home; but when she came to the ship’s side she saw that they were on the high seas, far from land, and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas.</td>
		<td class="en">当她看完最后一件金器后，对商人表示谢意，并准备回家；但是当她走到船边时，发现他们已经远离陆地，置身茫茫大海，而船已经张满风帆极速航行。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Oh!” she cried in terror, “I am deceived, carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!”</td>
		<td class="en">“噢！”她惊恐地喊道，“我被蒙骗了，被拐走了，被诱骗落入了一个商人的掌控之中，我宁可去死！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But the King seized her hand and spake: “I am no merchant, but a king of as high birth as yourself; and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem.</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Now it happened one day, while they were sailing on the high seas, that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him.</td>
		<td class="en">一天，当他们航行在茫茫大海上时，忠实的约翰坐在船头独自拉着小提琴，恰好看到三只渡鸦在空中朝他飞过来。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“不，他已经得到了，”第三只渡鸦说，“因为他俩在船上坐在一块儿呢！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then number one began again and cried: “That’ll not help him!</td>
		<td class="en">第一只渡鸦又开始叫了起来：“这对他也无济于事！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them: the King will wish to mount it, and if he does it will gallop away with him, and disappear into the air, and he will never see his bride again.”</td>
		<td class="en">当他们到岸时，一只栗色的马会向他们飞奔而来：国王会想骑上那匹马，如果他这么做的话，那匹马会载着他疾驰而去，消失在空中，而他再也见不到他的妻子了。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Is there no escape for him?” asked number two.</td>

		<td class="en">但是谁会那样做呢？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees.”</td>
		<td class="en">任何知道此事并将它告诉国王的人，他的腿部到膝盖都会变成石头。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then spake number two: “I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.”</td>
		<td class="en">接着，第二只乌鸦说道：“我知道的事情比这还多呢，就算那匹马死了，年轻的国王还是无法得到他的新娘：当他们一起进入宫殿时，会看到在衣橱上摆着一件现成的新婚礼服，看起来就像是用金银编织而成，但其实只是由硫黄和沥膏做成的：等国王穿上它时，就会被烧到骨髓里去。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Number three asked: “Is there no way of escape, then?”</td>
		<td class="en">第三只渡鸦问：“难道就没有脱险的办法吗？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Oh! yes,” answered number two: “If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved.</td>
		<td class="en">“噢！有！”第二只渡鸦说：“如果有人用戴手套的手抓起礼服将它扔到火堆里，让它烧起来，那么年轻的国王就得救了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But what’s the good?</td>
		<td class="en">但是这有什么用呢？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart.”</td>
		<td class="en">只要有人知道这事，并告诉别人，那么他身体的一半，从膝盖到心脏都会变成石头。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then number three spake: “I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King hasn’t even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die.</td>
		<td class="en">于是，第三只渡鸦又说道：“我知道得更多：即使新郎的礼服被烧了，国王到了那时仍然得不到新娘：婚礼结束后，当舞会举行，年轻的皇后开始跳舞时，她的脸色会突然苍白得像个死人，昏倒在地上，就像死了一样，除非有人扶起她，从她的身体右侧吸出三滴血并吐掉，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life.</td>
		<td class="en">渡鸦们交谈完后便飞走了，但是忠实的约翰已经听到了全部的对话，从那时开始他就感到忧郁而悲伤，因为如果他把听到的一切都对主人保密，就会使主人陷入不幸；但如果他将此事全部告诉主人，那么他自己就会丢掉性命。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At last he said: “I will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin.”</td>
		<td class="en">最后，他说：“我会对主人忠心的，哪怕这意味着失去我的性命。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Now when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had predicted, and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward.</td>
		<td class="en">当他们靠近陆地时，渡鸦预言的事情发生了，一匹漂亮的栗色的马跳了出来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“Capital!”</td>
		<td class="en">“好极了！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >said the King; “this animal shall carry me to my palace,” and was about to mount, but Trusty John was too sharp for him, and, springing up quickly, seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead.</td>
		<td class="en">国王说道，“这家伙会把我载回宫殿的。”说完正准备上马，可忠实的约翰反应太快了，迅速地跳上马，抽出手枪皮套里的手枪把马射死了。</td></tr>
