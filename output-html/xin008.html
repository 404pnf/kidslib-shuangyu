		<td class="en">过了一段时间之后，他发现独自一人坐上那么几个小时，脑子里只想着怎么交欠下的房租，这样真是没劲。由于马路对面的小酒馆看上去明亮又欢快，于是有一天他走了进去，和他的朋友们坐在了一起。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">牢骚父亲总是习惯于认为自己非常不幸，所以他弄不清楚圣人是不是在捉弄他；但他还是接过了篮子，连一声足够礼貌的“谢谢”或“早上好”都没有说，就离开了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >However, he only waited till he was out of sight of the cave before he stooped down and whispered: ‘Little basket, little basket, do your duty.’</td>

		<td class="en">牢骚父亲看到这食物的洪流，害怕极了，但最终他还是想起了圣人对他说过的话，于是他用最大的嗓门喊道：“够了！够了！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >That will do for to-day!’</td>
		<td class="en">今天的够了！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And the lid of the basket closed with a snap.</td>
		<td class="en">于是篮子盖咔哒一声合上了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Father Grumbler sighed with relief and happiness as he looked around him, and sitting down on a heap of stones, he ate till he could eat no more.</td>
		<td class="en">牢骚父亲环顾四周，放心且高兴地舒了口气，然后坐在一堆石头上，一直吃到再吃不下才停下。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Trout, salmon, turbot, soles, and a hundred other fishes whose names he did not know, lay boiled, fried, and grilled within reach of his hands.</td>
		<td class="en">鲑鱼、三文鱼、多宝鱼、鳎目鱼，还有其他许多他叫不上名字的鱼，煮的、炸的，还有烤的，他都伸手就能够到。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >As the Holy Man had said, he had never eaten such a dinner; still, when he had done, he shook his head, and grumbled; ‘Yes, there is plenty to eat, of course, but it only makes me thirsty, and there is not a drop to drink anywhere.’</td>
		<td class="en">正如圣人说的一样，他从来没有吃过这样的一顿饭菜；尽管如此，当他吃完后，他还是摇了摇头，抱怨道：“没错，是有很多吃的，当然了，但这只会把我给弄渴了，却哪儿也找不到一滴能喝的东西。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Yet, somehow, he could never tell why, he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him, which he thought was miles, and miles, and miles away.</td>
		<td class="en">然而，莫名其妙地，他也说不清为什么，他一抬头就看到那家小酒馆出现在自己面前。以前在他看来，这酒馆离他可是很远很远很远的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Bring the best wine you have got, and two glasses, good mother,’ he said as he entered, ‘and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house.</td>
		<td class="en">“把你们最好的酒拿出来，要两杯，老板娘，”他一进门就说，“另外，要是你们喜欢吃鱼，我这里有足够整个酒馆的人吃的鱼。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">唯一一点就是不要四处谈论这件事。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">你明白吗？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Eh?’</td>
		<td class="en">嗯？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" > And without waiting for an answer he whispered to the basket: ‘Little basket, little basket, do your duty.’</td>
		<td class="en">还不等老板娘回答，他就低声对魔法篮子说：“小篮子，小篮子，做你该做的事。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" > The innkeeper and his wife thought that their customer had gone suddenly mad, and watched him closely, ready to spring on him if he became violent; but both instinctively jumped backwards, nearly into the fire, as rolls and fishes of every kind came tumbling out of the basket, covering the tables and chairs and the floor, and even overflowing into the street.</td>
		<td class="en">客栈老板和他妻子心想他们这位客人突然疯了，便仔细观察他，准备好一旦他撒野就马上扑上去；但是看到面包卷和各种鱼从篮子里涌出来，铺满桌子、椅子和地板，甚至都要流到街上去了，俩人都本能地往后跳，差点儿跳到了火堆里。　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Be quick, be quick, and pick them up,’ cried the man.</td>
		<td class="en">“快，快，把它们捡起来，”牢骚父亲喊道，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘And if these are not enough, there are plenty more to be had for the asking.’</td>

		<td class="en">但尽管他们看似很忙，还是不忘互相耳语：</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘If we can only get hold of that basket it will make our fortune!’</td>
		<td class="en">“我们只要能得到那只篮子，就能发财了！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So they began by inviting Father Grumbler to sit down to the table, and brought out the best wine in the cellar, hoping it might loosen his tongue.</td>
		<td class="en">于是他们开始行动，他们邀请牢骚父亲坐到桌子旁，然后拿出酒窖里最好的酒，希望酒能套出他的话。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But Father Grumbler was wiser than they gave him credit for, and though they tried in all manner of ways to find out who had given him the basket, he put them off, and kept his secret to himself.</td>
		<td class="en">但牢骚父亲比他们称赞得还要聪明，尽管他们使出各种方法想查出是谁送的篮子，他都一一搪塞过去，保守了秘密。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Unluckily, though he did not SPEAK, he did drink, and it was not long before he fell fast asleep.</td>
		<td class="en">他的确什么也没说，但不幸的是，他喝了酒，所以他很快就睡熟了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then the woman fetched from her kitchen a basket, so like the magic one that no one, without looking very closely, could tell the difference, and placed it in Father Grumbler’s hand, while she hid the other carefully away.</td>
		<td class="en">于是老板娘从她的厨房取来一只篮子，这篮子像极了魔法篮子，要不仔细观察，没人能分辨出它们的区别。老板娘把它放在牢骚父亲手里，小心翼翼地把魔法篮子藏了起来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It was dinner time when the man awoke, and, jumping up hastily, he set out for home, where he found all the children gathered round a basin of thin soup, and pushing their wooden bowls forward, hoping to have the first spoonful.</td>
		<td class="en">牢骚父亲醒来时已是吃饭时间了，他急忙跳了起来，起身回家。到了家，他发现所有孩子都围拢在一盆稀粥旁，并把他们的木碗都往前伸，希望能喝上第一勺粥。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Their father burst into the midst of them, bearing his basket, and crying:</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The children, wondering and delighted, repeated the words, but nothing happened.</td>
		<td class="en">孩子们感到又惊奇又高兴，重复着那句话，但是什么也没发生。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Again and again they tried, but the basket was only a basket, with a few scales of fish sticking to the bottom, for the innkeeper’s wife had taken it to market the day before.</td>
		<td class="en">他们试了一遍又一遍，可篮子就仍只是一个篮子，篮子底上粘了几片鱼的鳞片，那是因为客栈老板的妻子前一天提着它去了趟市场。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘What is the matter with the thing?’ cried the father at last, snatching the basket from them, and turning it all over, grumbling and swearing while he did so, under the eyes of his astonished wife and children, who did not know whether to cry or to laugh.</td>
		<td class="en">“这东西怎么了？”父亲最后吼了起来，从孩子们中间把篮子抢了过来，然后将它翻了个底朝天，一边还嘟囔和咒骂着什么。妻子和孩子们惊讶地看着他，哭笑不得。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘It certainly smells of fish,’ he said, and then he stopped, for a sudden thought had come to him.</td>
		<td class="en">“这肯定是鱼的味道。”他说道，然后又止住，因为他突然闪过了一个念头。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Suppose it is not mine at all; supposing—Ah, the scoundrels!’</td>
		<td class="en">“我想这根本不是我的篮子；我想——噢，那两个无赖！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And without listening to his wife and children, who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home, he ran across to the tavern and burst open the door.</td>
		<td class="en">他的妻子和孩子们被他奇怪的行为吓到了，于是哀求他呆在家里，可他没听他们的话，而是跑到酒馆，闯了进去。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Can I do anything for you, Father Grumbler?’ asked the innkeeper’s wife in her softest voice.</td>
		<td class="en">“想吃点儿什么，牢骚父亲？”客栈老板的妻子用她最温柔的声音问道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘I have taken the wrong basket—by mistake, of course,’ said he.</td>
		<td class="en">“我拿错了篮子——当然了，是无意拿错的，”他说，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Here is yours, will you give me back my own?’</td>
		<td class="en">“这才是你们的篮子，能把我的还给我吗？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Why, what are you talking about?’ answered she.</td>
		<td class="en">“什么，你在说什么？”她答道，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘You can see for yourself that there is no basket here.’</td>
		<td class="en">“你可以自己看看，这里没有什么篮子。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And though Father Grumbler DID look, it was quite true that none was to be seen.</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Come, take a glass to warm you this cold day,’ said the woman, who was anxious to keep him in a good temper, and as this was an invitation Father Grumbler never refused, he tossed it off and left the house.</td>
		<td class="en">“来吧，大冷的天来喝一杯，暖暖你的身子。”老板娘这样说，是急于稳住他的情绪。牢骚父亲也从来不会拒绝这样的邀请，他把酒一饮而尽，便离开了酒馆。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He took the road that led to the Holy Man’s cave, and made such haste that it was not long before he reached it.</td>
		<td class="en">他又沿着那条通往圣人住的山洞的路走去，他走得很急，不一会儿就到了。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“噢，不会的，圣人先生，我没那么蠢。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Nor to tell everybody that I gave it to you,’ went on the Holy Man.</td>

		<td class="en">然后没等牢骚父亲回答，他就关上了门。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >As before, the distance seemed to have wonderfully shortened, and in a moment the tavern rose up in front of Father Grumbler.</td>
		<td class="en">像上次一样，这段路程似乎奇妙地缩短了，不一会儿，那家酒馆就出现在了牢骚父亲面前。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Without stopping to think, he went straight in, and found the innkeeper’s wife in the kitchen making a cake.</td>
		<td class="en">他都没停下想一想，就径直走了进去，他看到老板娘正在厨房里做蛋糕。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Where have you come from, with that fine red cock in your basket,’ asked she, for the bird was so big that the lid would not shut down properly.</td>
		<td class="en">“看你篮子里还装着那么漂亮的红公鸡，你从哪里弄来呀？”她问道，因为这鸟实在太大，盖子都没法好好合上。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Oh, I come from a place where they don’t keep these things by the dozen,’ he replied, sitting down in front of the table.</td>
		<td class="en">“哦，我从某个地方弄来的，在那里，人们像这样的东西可不多。”他回答道，坐在了桌前。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The woman said no more, but set before him a bottle of his favourite wine, and soon he began to wish to display his prize.</td>
		<td class="en">老板娘没再说什么，只是在他面前放了一瓶他最喜欢的酒。很快他就开始想展示他得到的礼物了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Show me what you can do, cock,’ cried he.</td>
		<td class="en">“公鸡，做你能做的给我看看。”他喊道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And the cock stood up and flapped his wings three times, crowing ‘coquerico’ with a voice like a trumpet, and at each crow there fell from his beak golden drops, and diamonds as large as peas.</td>
		<td class="en">只见公鸡站了起来，拍了三下翅膀，“喔喔喔”地叫着，那声音好像喇叭声，而且每叫一声，就有金粒从它嘴里掉下来，还有豌豆一般大小的钻石。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This time Father Grumbler did not invite the innkeeper’s wife to pick up his treasures, but put his own hat under the cock’s beak, so as to catch everything he let fall; and he did not see the husband and wife exchanging glances with each other which said, ‘That would be a splendid cock to put with our basket.’</td>
		<td class="en">这一次牢骚父亲没有邀请老板娘去捡他的宝物，而是把自己的帽子放在公鸡的嘴下方，以便接住从它嘴里掉下的每一样东西；而他也没看见那对夫妇在互相交换眼神，那眼神似乎在说：“这将是一只能和我们的篮子相配的公鸡。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Have another glass of wine?’ suggested the innkeeper, when they had finished admiring the beauty of the cock, for they pretended not to have seen the gold or the diamonds.</td>
		<td class="en">他们夸奖完公鸡的美，却假装没有看到金子或钻石，客栈老板还建议道：“再喝杯酒怎么样？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >And Father Grumbler, nothing loth, drank one glass after another, till his head fell forward on the table, and once more he was sound asleep.</td>
		<td class="en">牢骚父亲也很乐意地喝了一杯又一杯，直到他的头向前倒在了桌子上，他又一次睡熟了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Then the woman gently coaxed the cock from the basket and carried it off to her own poultry yard, from which she brought one exactly like it, and popped it in its place.</td>
		<td class="en">于是老板娘轻轻地把公鸡从篮子里哄出来，把它拿到自家的家禽院子里，再从里面抓了一只长得一模一样的，然后迅速把它放在了篮子里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Night was falling when the man awoke, and throwing proudly some grains of gold on the table to pay for the wine he had drunk, he tucked the cock comfortably into his basket and set out for home.</td>
		<td class="en">牢骚父亲醒来时天快要黑了，他得意地往桌上扔了几颗金子，付他喝的酒钱，然后把公鸡舒舒服服地往篮子里一塞，便起身回家了。</td></tr>
