		<td class="en">In 1924—to be precise, on the morning of January 3—the city of San Francisco awoke to read in one of its daily papers a curious letter, which had been received by Walter Bassett and which had evidently been written by some crank.Walter Bassett was the greatest captain of industry west of the Rockies, and was one of the small group that controlled the nation in everything but name.As such, he was the recipient of lucubrations from countless cranks; but this particular lucubration was so different from the average ruck of similar letters that, instead of putting it into the waste-basket, he had turned it over to a reporter.It was signed “Goliah,” and the superscription gave his address as “Palgrave Island.”The letter was as follows:</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我邀请您以及您的九位实业巨头同伴来我的岛上见我，来考虑一下用更理性的原则重建社会的一些方案。到目前为止，社会已经发展到一种盲目、漫无目的、笨拙的状态。变革的时候到了。人类已经由原始海洋黏质物的生命进化成为物质世界的主宰，但却还没掌控社会。现今的人类就如同十万代之前受物质世界的奴役一样，成为了集体愚蠢的奴隶。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am inviting you, with nine of your fellow-captains of industry, to visit me here on my island for the purpose of considering plans for the reconstruction of society upon a more rational basis.Up to the present, social evolution has been a blind and aimless, blundering thing.The time has come for a change.Man has risen from the vitalized slime of the primeval sea to the mastery of matter; but he has not yet mastered society.Man is to-day as much the slave to his collective stupidity, as a hundred thousand generations ago he was a slave to matter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“或许人们可以借助两种理论方法成为社会的主人，并且使社会成为一种追求并获得幸福快乐的明智而又有效的工具。第一种理论提出论点：没有任何政府能比组成政府的人更明智或者更好；改革和发展必须从个人开始；只要个人变得更明智、更好，政府就会同等程度地变得更明智、更好；简而言之，只有大多数的个人变得更明智、更好，政府才能变得更明智、更好。暴民、政治会议、还有群众的极度野蛮和愚蠢无知证明这个理论是假的。在一个暴民群体中，集体的智慧和仁慈就是由这个群体中最愚蠢和最粗鲁的人的智慧和仁慈构成的。另一方面，当一千名乘客所乘坐的船在海上遇到暴风雨时，他们会听从船长的智慧和判断力。在这种情形下，他是这群人中最聪明和最富有经验的人。</td>
		<td class="en">“There are two theoretical methods whereby man may become the master of society, and make of society an intelligent and efficacious device for the pursuit and capture of happiness and laughter.The first theory advances the proposition that no government can be wiser or better than the people that compose that government; that reform and development must spring from the individual; that in so far as the individuals become wiser and better, by that much will their government become wiser and better; in short, that the majority of individuals must become wiser and better, before their government becomes wiser and better.The mob, the political convention, the abysmal brutality and stupid ignorance of all concourses of people, give the lie to this theory.In a mob the collective intelligence and mercy is that of the least intelligent and most brutal members that compose the mob.On the other hand, a thousand passengers will surrender themselves to the wisdom and discretion of the captain, when their ship is in a storm on the sea.In such matter, he is the wisest and most experienced among them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“第二种理论则提出这样的论点：大多数人都不是开拓者，而是受早已定居的人的惰性所压制；代表他们的政府仅仅代表他们的软弱、无用还有野蛮；这个被称作政府的盲目的家伙不服从于人民意志，相反，人民意志是政府的奴隶；简言之，提到大众时，总会说并不是人民组成政府，而是政府左右人民，政府是而且一直是一个愚蠢而又可怕的怪物，从被惰性压制的大众手中骗取智慧的光环。</td>
		<td class="en">“The second theory advances the proposition that the majority of the people are not pioneers, that they are weighted down by the inertia of the established; that the government that is representative of them represents only their feebleness, and futility, and brutishness; that this blind thing called government is not the serf of their wills, but that they are the serfs of it; in short, speaking always of the great mass, that they do not make government, but that government makes them, and that government is and has been a stupid and awful monster, misbegotten of the glimmerings of intelligence that come from the inertia-crushed mass.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“个人来讲，我更青睐第二种理论。还有，我有些恼火。自我们野蛮的祖先建立第一个社会团体十万代以来，政府一直是个怪物。现在，被惰性所压制的大众与以往相比，少了很多快乐。虽然人类成了物质世界的主宰，但是人类的痛苦、苦难和堕落玷污了原本美好的世界。</td>
		<td class="en">“Personally, I incline to the second theory.Also, I am impatient. For a hundred thousand generations, from the first social groups of our savage forebears, government has remained a monster.To-day, the inertia-crushed mass has less laughter in it than ever before.In spite of man’s mastery of matter, human suffering and misery and degradation mar the fair world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“因此我已经决定暂时踏上这条世界之船并成为船长。我有技术娴熟的专家所具备的智慧和远见。同时，我也有这种权力。别人会听命于我。全世界的人都要听从我的命令来组建政府，这样他们才能成为制造快乐的人。我心目中的政府模型不是通过法令使人们高兴、明智和高尚，而是应当给人们机会，让他们变得高兴、明智和高尚。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这封信公之于世后，甚至都没有勾起当地人的兴味。当人们读这封信的时候可能会自己笑笑，但这很明显出自一个怪人的手笔，并不值得讨论。直到第二天早上，人们的兴趣才被激起。在嗅觉敏锐的记者们采访之后，美联社向东部各州发出急件，指出了其他九位实业巨头的名字，这些巨头也收到了类似的来信，但觉得没有必要把它公开。然而，群众激起的兴趣很温和，要不是加伯顿画了一幅题为“歌利亚”的一个一直争当总统的人的卡通像，它或许很快就消失了。之后有首歌被到处滑稽地传唱，重复着“你要是不小心，歌利亚就会找到你”。</td>
		<td class="en">The publication of this letter did not cause even local amusement.Men might have smiled to themselves as they read it, but it was so palpably the handiwork of a crank that it did not merit discussion.Interest did not arouse till next morning.An Associated Press despatch to the Eastern states, followed by interviews by eager-nosed reporters, had brought out the names of the other nine captains of industry who had received similar letters but who had not thought the matter of sufficient importance to be made public.But the interest aroused was mild, and it would have died out quickly had not Gabberton cartooned a chronic presidential aspirant as “Goliah”.Then came the song that was sung hilariously from sea to sea, with the refrain, “Goliah will catch you if you don’t watch out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >数周过去了，人们已经遗忘了这件事。沃尔特·巴西特也忘了这件事，但是二月二十二日晚上，他接到了来自港口收票员的电话。“我想通知你，”收票员说，“‘爱纳港号’游艇已经到了，停泊在七号码头。”</td>
		<td class="en">The weeks passed and the incident was forgotten.Walter Bassett had forgotten it likewise; but on the evening of February 22, he was called to the telephone by the Collector of the Port.“I just wanted to tell you,” said the latter, “that the yacht Energon has arrived and gone to anchor in the stream off Pier Seven.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃尔特·巴西特从未透露过那天晚上发生了什么。但是据说他开着自己的汽车到达码头，租了一艘克劳利的汽艇，然后被带上了那艘奇怪的游艇。据说当他三个小时后返回岸上后，立即发出了一札电报给他那九个曾收到歌利亚的信的实业巨头同伴。这些电报的措辞相差无多，写道：“‘爱纳港号’游艇已经到了。这里面有文章。我建议你过来”。</td>
		<td class="en">What happened that night Walter Bassett has never divulged.But it is known that he rode down in his auto to the water front, chartered one of Crowley’s launches, and was put aboard the strange yacht.It is further known that when he, returned to the shore, three hours later, he immediately despatched a sheaf of telegrams to his nine fellow captains of industry who had received letters from Goliah.These telegrams were similarly worded, and read: “The yacht Energon has arrived.There is something in this.I advise you to come.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴西特的担心受到人们的嘲笑。这股嘲笑愈演愈烈（因为他的那些电报已经被公开），那首广为传唱的关于歌利亚的歌曲又卷土重来，而且变得比以前更流行了。歌利亚和巴西特遭到了一幅题为“海上的老船夫”的卡通像无情的讽刺，画中歌利亚骑在巴西特的脖子上。俱乐部和社会各界的人们都在窃笑，在社论中是有所克制的欢笑，在连环漫画周刊中则是轰然大笑。也有比较严肃的一方，很多人都严重质疑巴西特是否明智，尤其是他的生意伙伴。</td>
		<td class="en">Bassett was laughed at for his pains.It was a huge laugh that went up (for his telegrams had been made public), and the popular song on Goliah revived and became more popular than ever.Goliah and Bassett were cartooned and lampooned unmercifully, the former, as the Old Man of the Sea, riding on the latter’s neck.The laugh tittered and rippled through clubs and social circles, was restrainedly merry in the editorial columns, and broke out in loud guffaws in the comic weeklies.There was a serious side as well, and Bassett’s sanity was gravely questioned by many, and especially by his business associates.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴西特原本是一个脾气暴躁的人，但当他给兄弟同伴们发了第二札电报并且再次受到嘲笑之后，他依旧保持着沉默。在第二札电报中，他写道：“过来吧，我恳求你。要是珍惜你的生命，那就过来。”他搁置了所有的商业事务离开了，在三月二日晚上登上了“爱纳港号”游艇。这艘游艇经过适当清洗，第二天早上启航了。第二天早上，每个城镇的报童都叫喊着“号外”。</td>
		<td class="en">Bassett had ever been a short-tempered man, and after he sent the second sheaf of telegrams to his brother captains, and had been laughed at again, he remained silent.In this second sheaf, he had said: “Come, I implore you.As you value your life, come.”He arranged all his business affairs for an absence, and on the night of March 2 went on board the Energon.The latter, properly cleared, sailed next morning.And next morning the newsboys in every city and town were crying “Extra.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >用当时的俚语说，歌利亚已承兑了他之前的诺言。九个没有接受他邀请的实业巨头都死了。被杀害的百万富翁的多次尸检结果表明，死亡是由一种暴力的组织分解造成的；然而外科医生和内科医生（包括当地医术最为精湛的医生）都不敢说这些人是被谋杀的。他们更不敢下结论说是“陌生人下的手”。这一切都太神秘了。他们都感到震惊。他们对科学的信心崩溃了。他们没有任何科学依据能证明帕尔格雷夫岛上的一个无名人士杀害了这些可怜的绅士们。</td>
		<td class="en">In the slang of the day, Goliah had delivered the goods.The nine captains of industry who had failed to accept his invitation were dead.A sort of violent disintegration of the tissues was the report of the various autopsies held on the bodies of the slain millionnaires; yet the surgeons and physicians (the most highly skilled in the land had participated) would not venture the opinion that the men had been slain.Much less would they venture the conclusion, “at the hands of parties unknown.”It was all too mysterious.They were stunned.Their scientific credulity broke down.They had no warrant in the whole domain of science for believing that an anonymous person on Palgrave Island had murdered the poor gentlemen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，有一件事迅速传开了，那就是帕尔格雷夫岛不是传说。所有的航海家经测绘得知，这座岛位于西经160°和北纬10°的交叉点上，距离黛安娜浅滩仅有数英里。和中途岛以及范宁岛一样，帕尔格雷夫岛是座孤岛，由火山和珊瑚组成。另外，这个岛上没人居住。在一八八七年，一艘测量船到过那个地方，并且说那里有几条溪流，是个很不错却很难接近的港口。这就是人们得知的关于那个小岛的全部内容了，不久之后，全世界都敬畏地关注这里。</td>
		<td class="en">One thing was quickly learned, however, namely, that Palgrave Island was no myth.It was charted and well known to all navigators, lying on the line of 160 west longitude, right at its intersection by the tenth parallel north latitude, and only a few miles away from Diana Shoal.Like Midway and Fanning, Palgrave Island was isolated, volcanic and coral in formation.Furthermore, it was uninhabited.A survey ship, in 1887, had visited the place and reported the existence of several springs and of a good harbor that was very dangerous of approach.And, that was all that was known of the tiny speck of land that was soon to have focussed on it the awed attention of the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >直到三月二十四日，歌利亚依旧保持沉默。当天早上，报纸刊登了他的第二封信，美国十位首要的政治人物——人们惯称之为“政客”的十位政界领导人都收到了这封信。这封信和之前的地址一样，内容如下：</td>
		<td class="en">Goliah remained silent till March 24. On the morning of that day, the newspapers published his second letter, copies of which had been received by the ten chief politicians of the United States—ten leading men in the political world who were conventionally known as “statesmen.”The letter, with the same superscription as before, was as follows: </td></tr>

		<td class="en">As the years went by, Goliah dropped out of the running of the world.There was nothing for him to run.The world was running itself, and doing it smoothly and beautifully.In 1937, Goliah made his long-promised present of Energon to the world.He himself had devised a thousand ways in which the little giant should do the work of the world—all of which he made public at the same time.But instantly the colleges of invention seized upon Energon and utilized it in a hundred thousand additional ways.In fact, as Goliah confessed in his letter of March, 1938, the colleges of invention cleared up several puzzling features of Energon that had baffled him during the preceding years.With the introduction of the use of Energon the two-hour work-day was cut down almost to nothing.As Goliah had predicted, work indeed became play.And, so tremendous was man’s productive capacity, due to Energon and the rational social utilization of it, that the humblest citizen enjoyed leisure and time and opportunity for an immensely greater abundance of living than had the most favored under the old anarchistic system.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没有人见过歌利亚，所有人都开始要求他们的救世主出现。但是世界并没有把他的功劳局限于他发现了“爱纳港号”，人们认为比“爱纳港号”更伟大的是他广阔的社会观察视野。他是一个超人，一个科学超人；人们想要见到他的那种好奇心几乎无法克制。一九四一年，歌利亚犹豫了很久之后，终于离开帕尔格雷夫岛，开始露面。他在六月六日抵达旧金山，这是自他隐居帕尔格雷夫岛以来，人们第一次看到了他的面容。而人们失望了。人们的想象力受到触动。英雄的形象已经不再适合歌利亚。他就是那个翻转整个星球的人，或者更确切地说是半人半神。亚历山大、凯撒、成吉思汗还有拿破仑的事迹和他的巨大成就相比简直是儿戏。</td>
		<td class="en">Nobody had ever seen Goliah, and all peoples began to clamor for their savior to appear.While the world did not minimize his discovery of Energon, it was decided that greater than that was his wide social vision.He was a superman, a scientific superman; and the curiosity of the world to see him had become well-nigh unbearable.It was in 1941, after much hesitancy on his part, that he finally emerged from Palgrave island.He arrived on June 6 in San Francisco, and for the first time, since his retirement to Palgrave Island, the world looked upon his face.And the world was disappointed.Its imagination had been touched.An heroic figure had been made out of Goliah.He was the man, or the demigod, rather, who bad turned the planet over.The deeds of Alexander, Caesar, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon were as the play of babes alongside his colossal achievements.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在旧金山的沿岸和街道上行走着这样一个瘦小的老人：六十五岁，保养得很好，白里透红的面色，头上有一块苹果般大小的秃头顶。他是近视眼，带着眼镜。他如果摘掉了眼镜，那蓝色的、好奇的眼睛看上去就和孩子的一样，充满了对世界微微的好奇。还有，随着他面部的扭曲，他的眼睛总是闪烁着，好像在嘲笑他对世界开的那个巨大的玩笑，这让它不由自主地陷入到了在欢乐和幸福之中。</td>
		<td class="en">And ashore in San Francisco and through its streets stepped and rode a little old man, sixty-five years of age, well preserved, with a pink-and-white complexion and a bald spot on his head the size of an apple.He was short-sighted and wore spectacles.But when the spectacles were removed, his were quizzical blue eyes like a child’s, filled with mild wonder at the world.Also his eyes had a way of twinkling, accompanied by a screwing up of the face, as if he laughed at the huge joke he had played upon the world, trapping it, in spite of itself, into happiness and laughter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >作为一个科学超人和世界的专制君主，他有一些不同寻常的嗜好。他喜欢吃糖，而且特别喜欢腌制的杏仁和山核桃，后者更甚。他总是在口袋中装着一纸包这些食物，他经常说他天生的身体机能需要这样的食品。或许他最让人惊讶的弱点是他怕猫。他对那种驯养的动物有一种根深蒂固的厌恶之情。有一件事会一直被人们铭记，那是他在兄弟堂演讲时，看门人的猫跑到演讲台上来并在他的腿上蹭，他突然受到惊吓昏死了过去。</td>
		<td class="en">For a scientific superman and world tyrant, he had remarkable weaknesses.He loved sweets, and was inordinately fond of salted almonds and salted pecans, especially of the latter.He always carried a paper bag of them in his pocket, and he had a way of saying frequently that the chemism of his nature demanded such fare.Perhaps his most astonishing failing was cats.He had an ineradicable aversion to that domestic animal.It will be remembered that he fainted dead away with sudden fright, while speaking in Brotherhood Palace, when the janitor’s cat walked out upon the stage and brushed against his legs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是当他醒过来的时候人们就认出了他的身份。他昔日的朋友们很轻易地就认出他是珀西瓦尔·斯塔尔茨，德裔美国人，一八九八年曾在联合钢铁公司船厂工作，而且当时在国际机械师兄弟联盟三六九支部担任了两年秘书。一九零一年，当时二十五岁的他在加利福尼亚大学修读专业科学课程，同时通过做当时称为“生命保险”的代理人来养活自己。他学生时代的成绩仍然存放在大学博物馆中，并不突出。那些教过他的大学教授还记得他，主要是因为他老爱心不在焉。毫无疑问，甚至在那时，他就看到了后来他所拥有的宽广的视野。</td>
		<td class="en">But no sooner had he revealed himself to the world than he was identified.Old-time friends had no difficulty in recognizing him as Percival Stultz, the German-American who, in 1898, had worked in the Union Iron Works, and who, for two years at that time, had been secretary of Branch 369 of the International Brotherhood of Machinists.It was in 1901, then twenty-five years of age, that he had taken special scientific courses at the University of California, at the same time supporting himself by soliciting what was then known as “life insurance.”His records as a student are preserved in the university museum, and they are unenviable.He is remembered by the professors he sat under chiefly for his absentmindedness.Undoubtedly, even then, he was catching glimpses of the wide visions that later were to be his.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他后来解释说，他给自己取名叫“歌利亚”并给自己罩上神秘的色彩是他开的一个小玩笑。他说，叫歌利亚或者任何其他名字，他都能触动世界的想象力并将世界翻转；但是作为珀西瓦尔·斯塔尔茨，满脸络腮胡子，戴着眼镜，体重一百一十八英镑，他翻不转一个核桃——“甚至一个腌制的山核桃也不行。”</td>
		<td class="en">His naming himself “Goliah” and shrouding himself in mystery was his little joke, he later explained.As Goliah, or any other thing like that, he said, he was able to touch the imagination of the world and turn it over; but as Percival Stultz, wearing side-whiskers and spectacles, and weighing one hundred and eighteen pounds, he would have been unable to turn over a pecan—“not even a salted pecan.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是他的个人形象和趣事使得人们很快就将失望抛在脑后。全世界都知道他，并尊崇他为时代的思想大师；全世界因为他忠于自己，因为他那好奇的、近视眼，还有他因为面部扭曲而独特的笑而喜欢他；还因为他的朴素、友谊和温暖的人性而喜欢他，因为他喜欢腌制的核桃，厌恶猫而喜欢他。现在，在仙宫的那座非凡的城市里竖起了他的纪念碑，这座碑非常漂亮，让金字塔和所有沾染血迹的、罪恶古老的纪念碑都相形见绌。众所周知，那座纪念碑上用青铜刻着不朽的预言和预言的应验：“所有人都将是愉悦的人，他们的任务就是将快乐从发出清脆响亮声的生活的砧琴中敲打出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">But the world quickly got over its disappointment in his personal appearance and antecedents.It knew him and revered him as the master-mind of the ages; and it loved him for himself, for his quizzical shortsighted eyes and the inimitable way in which he screwed up his face when he laughed; it loved him for his simplicity and comradeship and warm humanness, and for his fondness for salted pecans and his aversion to cats.And to-day, in the wonder-city of Asgard, rises in awful beauty that monument to him that dwarfs the pyramids and all the monstrous blood-stained monuments of antiquity.And on that monument, as all know, is inscribed in imperishable bronze the prophecy and the fulfillment: “ALL WILL BE JOY-SMITHS, AND THEIR TASK SHALL BE TO BEAT OUT LAUGHTER FROM THE RINGING ANVIL OF LIFE.”</td></tr>
