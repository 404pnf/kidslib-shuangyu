		<td class="en">德普兰具有如神的眼光，他能凭借一种与生俱来的抑或是后天养成的直觉，看透患者内心及所患疾病。这种直觉使得他能针对不同个体作出准确的诊断，进而确定手术的时间，具体到小时和分钟，同时充分考虑到气候状况以及个体特质。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >To him the terrestrial atmosphere was a generative envelope; he saw the earth as an egg within its shell; and not being able to determine whether the egg or the hen first was, he would not recognize either the cock or the egg.</td>
		<td class="en">在他看来，地球大气层是一个能孕育万物的外壳。他将地球视作一个带壳的鸡蛋，既然无法证明是先有的鸡还是先有的蛋，他便对二者都不认可。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He believed neither in the antecedent animal nor the surviving spirit of man.</td>
		<td class="en">他既不相信人类由动物进化而来，也不相信死后灵魂不灭。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Desplein had no doubts; he was positive.</td>
		<td class="en">他凡事不抱怀疑，而是判断果决。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >His bold and unqualified atheism was like that of many scientific men, the best men in the world, but invincible atheists—atheists such as religious people declare to be impossible.</td>
		<td class="en">科学家是世上最优秀的人，他就跟他们一样，是个彻底的无神论者，他坦率地坚持无神论，就像宗教人士坚持神的存在一样执著。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This opinion could scarcely exist otherwise in a man who was accustomed from his youth to dissect the creature above all others—before, during, and after life; to hunt through all his organs without ever finding the individual soul, which is indispensable to religious theory.</td>
		<td class="en">若非从年轻时起就经常出色地解剖未出生的、活着的，或是死去的生命体，他是不会有这一观点的。他研究了每一个器官，却没有察觉到宗教理论所坚持的必不可少的灵魂。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When he detected a cerebral centre, a nervous centre, and a centre for aerating the blood—the first two so perfectly complementary that in the latter years of his life he came to a conviction that the sense of hearing is not absolutely necessary for hearing, nor the sense of sight for seeing, and that the solar plexus could supply their place without any possibility of doubt—Desplein, thus finding two souls in man, confirmed his atheism by this fact, though it is no evidence against God.</td>
		<td class="en">他发现了人体有大脑中枢、神经中枢和血液供氧中枢，前两者完美地互相补充。于是，晚年时他确信视觉未必是“看”所必需的，听觉亦未必是“听”所必需的，因为腹腔神经丛可以毫无疑问地代替它们的功能。因此，德普兰在人体里发现两个“灵魂”，这一事实更坚定了他的无神论，尽管这并不表示上帝不存在。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This man died, it is said, in final impenitence, as do, unfortunately, many noble geniuses, whom God may forgive.</td>
		<td class="en">据说，这个人最终也未做忏悔，就像许多杰出的天才一样，就这样不幸地死去。上帝或许会原谅他们吧。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The life of this man, great as he was, was marred by many meannesses, to use the expression employed by his enemies, who were anxious to diminish his glory, but which it would be more proper to call apparent contradictions.</td>
		<td class="en">杰出如他，也不免被那些急于抹杀他荣耀的对手所诋毁，借这些人的话来说，他一生有许多瑕疵。与其称之为“瑕疵”，倒不如称之为显而易见的矛盾更为合适。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Envious people and fools, having no knowledge of the determinations by which superior spirits are moved, seize at once on superficial inconsistencies, to formulate an accusation and so to pass sentence on them.</td>
		<td class="en">嫉妒者与愚蠢者不懂杰出者的取舍，而是立刻抓住一些外在的矛盾，便去诟病非议继而以罪责相加。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >If, subsequently, the proceedings thus attacked are crowned with success, showing the correlations of the preliminaries and the results, a few of the vanguard of calumnies always survive.</td>
		<td class="en">结果，即使所非议的事情获得成功，表明初步计划与结论之间的关联，一些先前的诽谤仍然会有留有影响。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >In our day, for instance, Napoleon was condemned by our contemporaries when he spread his eagle’s wings to alight in England: only 1822 could explain 1804 and the flatboats at Boulogne.</td>
		<td class="en">例如，在我们这个时代，当拿破仑想将他的鹰翼伸到英国时就曾受到指责，只有到了1822年才能够解释1804年所发生的一切，还有停泊在布洛涅的平底船到底是怎么回事。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >As, in Desplein, his glory and science were invulnerable, his enemies attacked his odd moods and his temper, whereas, in fact, he was simply characterized by what the English call eccentricity.</td>
		<td class="en">德普兰的荣耀与学术是无懈可击的，他的对手便转而攻击他古怪的脾气与性情。而事实上，他最鲜明的特征就是英国人所称的“怪癖”。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Sometimes very handsomely dressed, like Crebillon the tragical, he would suddenly affect extreme indifference as to what he wore; he was sometimes seen in a carriage, and sometimes on foot.</td>
		<td class="en">有时，他就像悲剧作家克雷比永一样，衣着潇洒，有时却突然对自己的着装满不在乎；有时人们看见他乘坐马车，有时见他步行。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >By turns rough and kind, harsh and covetous on the surface, but capable of offering his whole fortune to his exiled masters—who did him the honor of accepting it for a few days—no man ever gave rise to such contradictory judgements.</td>
		<td class="en">他时而疾言厉色，时而温良和蔼，表面上贪财吝啬，却又能够将自己所有的财富赠予流放在外的老师，而这些老师也乐于赏脸，一度也曾接受馈赠。没人像他一样招致诸多大相径庭的评价。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Although to obtain a black ribbon, which physicians ought not to intrigue for, he was capable of dropping a prayer-book out of his pocket at Court, in his heart he mocked at everything; he had a deep contempt for men, after studying them from above and below, after detecting their genuine expression when performing the most solemn and the meanest acts of their lives.</td>
		<td class="en">尽管为了得到那条本不该是内科医生希冀的黑色丝带，他可能会在王宫里刻意从口袋中掉落祈祷书。但在他心里，他对一切都是不屑一顾的。他深深地鄙视着人们，因为他把人从头到脚都研究过了，在人一生最庄严和最卑微的行为中，他都能看到最真实的一面。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The qualities of a great man are often federative.</td>
		<td class="en">伟人的品质往往是综合的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >If among these colossal spirits one has more talent than wit, his wit is still superior to that of a man of whom it is simply stated that “he is witty.”</td>
		<td class="en">如果在一群伟人中，某个人才华甚于机智，那么他的机智相对于一般的“机智之人”而言，则更胜一筹。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Genius always presupposes moral insight.</td>
		<td class="en">天赋往往是以道德洞察力为前提依据的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This insight may be applied to a special subject; but he who can see a flower must be able to see the sun.</td>
		<td class="en">这种洞察力或许该运用到某一学科，但是能够看见花朵的人必定能够看得见太阳。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The man who on hearing a diplomate he has saved ask, “How is the Emperor?” could say, “The courtier is alive; the man will follow!”—that man is not merely a surgeon or a physician, he is prodigiously witty also.</td>
		<td class="en">当那个人听到被他救活的外交官问他：“皇帝怎么样了？”，他会答道：“大臣还活着，皇帝自会无恙。”那么这个人就不仅是一名外科或内科医生，而且还是一个异常机智诙谐的人。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Hence a patient and diligent student of human nature will admit Desplein’s exorbitant pretensions, and believe—as he himself believed—that he might have been no less great as a minister than he was as a surgeon.</td>
		<td class="en">因此一个孜孜不倦耐心研究人性的人，必会认可德普兰夸张的自负，并相信——德普兰本人也认为如此——他若当部长并不会逊色于做医生。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Among the riddles which Desplein’s life presents to many of his contemporaries, we have chosen one of the most interesting, because the answer is to be found at the end of the narrative, and will avenge him for some foolish charges.</td>
		<td class="en">在许多同时代的人看来，德普兰的生活充满了不解之谜，我们选择了其中最有意思的来讲述，因为在文章结尾处，将会给出答案，这也会帮他洗清冤屈。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">德普兰所在医院的所有学生中，他最关心的一个是霍勒斯·毕安训。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Before being a house surgeon at the Hotel-Dieu, Horace Bianchon had been a medical student lodging in a squalid boarding house in the Quartier Latin, known as the Maison Vauquer.</td>
		<td class="en">在成为市立医院实习医生之前，霍勒斯·毕安训是一名医科学生，寄宿在位于拉丁区一所名为伏盖的破公寓内。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This poor young man had felt there the gnawing of that burning poverty which is a sort of crucible from which great talents are to emerge as pure and incorruptible as diamonds, which may be subjected to any shock without being crushed.</td>
		<td class="en">这个可怜的年轻人在那里饱受贫困的煎熬，这是一种磨炼，伟大的天才人物最终会被锻造成纯洁无瑕、坚硬无比的钻石，经受得住任何打击。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >In the fierce fire of their unbridled passions they acquire the most impeccable honesty, and get into the habit of fighting the battles which await genius with the constant work by which they coerce their cheated appetites.</td>
		<td class="en">在熊熊燃烧的激情之火中，他们被锻炼成至诚至信之人，养成艰苦奋斗的习惯，以不懈的努力去战胜虚无的欲望。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Horace was an upright young fellow, incapable of tergiversation on a matter of honor, going to the point without waste of words, and as ready to pledge his cloak for a friend as to give him his time and his night hours.</td>
		<td class="en">霍勒斯是一个正直的年轻人，在事关荣誉的问题不会拐弯抹角，说话直奔主题，随时愿意为朋友抵押自己的大衣，也愿意为他们牺牲自己的时间甚至熬夜。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Horace, in short, was one of those friends who are never anxious as to what they may get in return for what they give, feeling sure that they will in their turn get more than they give.</td>
		<td class="en">简而言之，霍勒斯属于这样一种朋友，他从不担心自己的付出会得到什么样的回报，他确信自己得到的回报会大于付出。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Most of his friends felt for him that deeply-seated respect which is inspired by unostentatious virtue, and many of them dreaded his censure.</td>
		<td class="en">质朴的美德让他的多数朋友深深地尊重他，许多朋友甚至害怕他的批评。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But Horace made no pedantic display of his qualities.</td>
		<td class="en">霍勒斯展现这些品质时，却绝不会显得迂腐。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He was neither a puritan nor a preacher; he could swear with a grace as he gave his advice, and was always ready for a jollification when occasion offered.</td>
		<td class="en">他既非清教徒，也非布道者，在给别人提建议时会有风度地赌咒骂人，遇到机会也会去凑凑热闹。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >A jolly companion, not more prudish than a trooper, as frank and outspoken—not as a sailor, for nowadays sailors are wily diplomates—but as an honest man who has nothing in his life to hide, he walked with his head erect, and a mind content.</td>
		<td class="en">他是个不错的伙伴，不像骑兵那样假道学，他的坦诚直率也不像水手那样，因为如今的水手都像外交官一样狡黠。他就像个真诚的年轻人，生活中无所隐瞒。他走起路来昂首阔步，志得意满。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >In short, to put the facts into a word, Horace was the Pylades of more than one Orestes—creditors being regarded as the nearest modern equivalent to the Furies of the ancients.</td>
		<td class="en">总之，将这些事实浓缩成一句话，霍勒斯是许多俄瑞斯忒斯眼中的皮拉德斯，而债主们则是复仇女神在今天最真实的形象。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He carried his poverty with the cheerfulness which is perhaps one of the chief elements of courage, and, like all people who have nothing, he made very few debts.</td>
		<td class="en">他欣然地接受贫困，那或许是他勇气的重要来源之一。像所有一无所有的人一样，他很少借债。</td></tr>
