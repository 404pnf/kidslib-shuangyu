		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（按：故事中的事件虽非同寻常，但并非虚构，而是确有其事——甚至被告的公开忏悔都是事实。这些事件取材于一个古老的瑞典刑事案件，我改变了其中的角色，并将其背景转换至美国。我还加入了些细节，但只有少数是重要的。——马克·吐温）</td>
		<td class="en">(Note: Strange as the incidents of this story are, they are not inventions, but facts—even to the public confession of the accused. I take them from an old-time Swedish criminal trial, change the actors, and transfer the scenes to America. I have added some details, but only a couple of them are important ones.—M.T.)</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >嗯，就在我和汤姆·索耶将黑人老吉姆释放之后的下一个春天，他被视为逃跑未遂的奴隶而被拴在汤姆的叔叔赛拉斯在阿肯色州的农场上。严寒正慢慢地从地面和空气中散去，离赤脚的时节也一天天地临近了；而接下来将陆续是玩弹珠、玩掷刀游戏、玩铁圈以及放风筝的时候，接着就马上到了夏季，可以去游泳了。这样的展望恰恰让一个小男孩犯了思乡症，并且对遥远的夏天抱有憧憬。是的，这让他长叹一口气，而且一脸愁容，有些事情在困扰着他，而他自己也不知道是什么事。　　　但即便如此，他还是会独自外出，郁郁沉思；他最常去山顶上树林边，找一个人烟稀少的地方，在那里呆着，看着山下的密西西比河环绕着树林向着远方延伸着，直到看见看起来模糊不清的树林被层层烟雾笼罩，遥远而寂静，一切看上去如此庄严肃穆，就如同你所敬爱的人过世时那样，而这时你所想的就是和他们一起死去，离开这个世界。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, it was the next spring after me and Tom Sawyer set our old nigger Jim free, the time he was chained up for a runaway slave down there on Tom’s uncle Silas’s farm in Arkansaw.The frost was working out of the ground, and out of the air, too, and it was getting closer and closer onto barefoot time every day; and next it would be marble time, and next mumbletypeg, and next tops and hoops, and next kites, and then right away it would be summer and going in a-swimming.It just makes a boy homesick to look ahead like that and see how far off summer is.Yes, and it sets him to sighing and saddening around, and there’s something the matter with him, he don’t know what.But anyway, he gets out by himself and mopes and thinks; and mostly he hunts for a lonesome place high up on the hill in the edge of the woods, and sets there and looks away off on the big Mississippi down there a-reaching miles and miles around the points where the timber looks smoky and dim it’s so far off and still, and everything’s so solemn it seems like everybody you’ve loved is dead and gone, and you most wish you was dead and gone too, and done with it all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >难道你不知道那是什么吗？那就是春倦症。这就是它的名称。一旦染上它，你就会想做某事——噢，实际上也许你根本不清楚到底想做什么，但那却让你的心都痛了，你是如此得想到它！对于你而言，你所想要的就是脱身罢了；从你所司空见惯的老套而又令人厌倦的东西中脱身，去寻找新的东西。这就是你的想法；你想离开去当一个流浪者；你想去一个遥远而又陌生的国度流浪，在那里任何东西都是神秘、美妙而浪漫的。如果这些你无法做到，你将退而求其次；你将去能到达的任何地方，只要能让自己脱身便可，并也将对此机遇心存感激。</td>
		<td class="en">Don’t you know what that is?It’s spring fever.That is what the name of it is.And when you’ve got it, you want—oh, you don’t quite know what it is you DO want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you want it so!It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away; get away from the same old tedious things you’re so used to seeing and so tired of, and set something new.That is the idea; you want to go and be a wanderer; you want to go wandering far away to strange countries where everything is mysterious and wonderful and romantic.And if you can’t do that, you’ll put up with considerable less; you’ll go anywhere you CAN go, just so as to get away, and be thankful of the chance, too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好吧，我和汤姆·索耶也严重地染上了春倦症；但想象汤姆尝试逃脱是没用的，正如他所说的，他姑姑波利绝不会允许他辍学去四处溜达、浪费时间，所以我们很沮丧。有一天黄昏，当我们坐在门口的台阶处时，波利姑姑手里拿着一封信走过来对我们说：</td>
		<td class="en">Well, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and had it bad, too; but it warn’t any use to think about Tom trying to get away, because, as he said, his Aunt Polly wouldn’t let him quit school and go traipsing off somers wasting time; so we was pretty blue.We was setting on the front steps one day about sundown talking this way, when out comes his aunt Polly with a letter in her hand and says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“汤姆，我认为你该收拾行李去阿肯色州了——萨莉婶婶想让你去她那儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tom, I reckon you’ve got to pack up and go down to Arkansaw—your aunt Sally wants you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我当时简直欣喜若狂。我本以为汤姆会奔向他姑姑，并紧紧抱住她；可是如果您相信我的话，他还是坐在那儿稳如磐石，一言不发。在这样一个绝好机会前，他表现得如此愚笨，我差点儿叫出声来。为什么这么说，因为如果他这样一声不吭，不表达他的感激之情，我们很可能会因此而丢掉这个机会。可他就一直在那一动不动，沉思着沉思着，这让我很犯愁，不知道该怎么办；而接下来他平静地说了句话，听了那话，我很想揍他：</td>
		<td class="en">I ’most jumped out of my skin for joy.I reckoned Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head off; but if you believe me he set there like a rock, and never said a word.It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up.Why, we might lose it if he didn’t speak up and show he was thankful and grateful.But he set there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didn’t know what to do; then he says, very ca’m, and I could a shot him for it:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，”他说，“波利姑姑，十分抱歉，现在——我想离开一会儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well,” he says, “I’m right down sorry, Aunt Polly, but I reckon I got to be excused—for the present.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >波利姑姑对他如此冷漠无礼的行为而感到诧异，半分钟内都没说出话来，不过这倒也让我有机会轻轻碰了下汤姆，低声告诉他：</td>
		<td class="en">His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at the cold impudence of it that she couldn’t say a word for as much as a half a minute, and this gave me a chance to nudge Tom and whisper:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“难道你真的不明白？你真打算就这么浪费并丢掉这么好的机会吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ain’t you got any sense?Sp’iling such a noble chance as this and throwing it away?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但他似乎并不为此所困扰。他咕哝着回应我：</td>
		<td class="en">But he warn’t disturbed.He mumbled back:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈克·费恩，难道你想我让她知道自己是多么迫切地想去那吗？何必要这样，这样她会马上怀疑并想象许多疾病、危险和障碍，然后你便会看到她收回成命。让我自己呆会儿；我想我知道该怎么对付她。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Huck Finn, do you want me to let her SEE how bad I want to go?Why, she’d begin to doubt, right away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers and objections, and first you know she’d take it all back.You lemme alone; I reckon I know how to work her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到目前为止我确实没像他这么考虑过。不过他是对的。汤姆·索耶总是对的——他是我所见过的人中头脑最冷静的一个，而且最能保持真我，并能对突如其来的事有所准备。这回他姑姑再次直接地告诉他，并对他发了脾气。她说：</td>
		<td class="en">Now I never would ‘a’ thought of that.But he was right.Tom Sawyer was always right—the levelest head I ever see, and always AT himself and ready for anything you might spring on him.By this time his aunt Polly was all straight again, and she let fly.She says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你可以离开！你完全可以！嗯，我还从没听过有人这样说话！就像你刚对我说的那些！快闭嘴，赶紧去收拾行李；要是让我再听到诸如你想离开或者你不想去的话，我发誓你必须要吃一顿鞭子才能获得我的原谅。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ll be excused!YOU will!Well, I never heard the like of it in all my days!The idea of you talking like that to ME!Now take yourself off and pack your traps; and if I hear another word out of you about what you’ll be excused from and what you won’t, I lay I’LL excuse you—with a hickory!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她戴着针箍的手正准备狠敲他脑袋，我们躲闪开了，他假装呜咽着和我跑上楼。他一上房间便抱住了我，因为他可以去旅行了，所以高兴得有点儿失去理智。然后他说：</td>
		<td class="en">She hit his head a thump with her thimble as we dodged by, and he let on to be whimpering as we struck for the stairs.Up in his room he hugged me, he was so out of his head for gladness because he was going traveling.And he says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在我们离开前，她会希望她没有应许过让我离开，但现在她已经无法改变现实了。一旦说出了口，她的自尊心就不会允许自己把说出的话再收回了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Before we get away she’ll wish she hadn’t let me go, but she won’t know any way to get around it now.After what she’s said, her pride won’t let her take it back.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >汤姆在十分钟内就收拾好了行李，除了剩下的一些由他姑姑和玛丽为他打点；然后我们又等了十多分钟让她冷静下来，让她恢复慈祥的样子；因为汤姆说如果她没完全生气一般只需十分钟就能恢复镇定，一旦她完全生气则需要二十分钟才能恢复，而她这回看来是完全生气了。然后我们下了楼，急于想知道信的内容。</td>
		<td class="en">Tom was packed in ten minutes, all except what his aunt and Mary would finish up for him; then we waited ten more for her to get cooled down and sweet and gentle again; for Tom said it took her ten minutes to unruffle in times when half of her feathers was up, but twenty when they was all up, and this was one of the times when they was all up.Then we went down, being in a sweat to know what the letter said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她坐在那儿陷入沉思，信封就在她的腿上。我们一坐下，她便说：</td>
		<td class="en">She was setting there in a brown study, with it laying in her lap.We set down, and she says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们在那儿遇到了许多麻烦，而你和哈克对他们来说能转换一下气氛，用他们的话说就是——‘安慰’。我认为，他们会从你和哈克·费恩身上得到不少的放松。她有一个邻居叫布雷斯·邓拉普，在过去的三个多月里，他一直想娶他们的本尼，最后他们就直截了当地告诉他那是不可能的；因此布雷斯·邓拉普对他们的态度就变差了，他们一直在担心此事。我认为对于布雷斯·邓拉普，他们应该都想获得他的青睐，因为他们曾经想讨好过他，在农场几乎无力承受的情况下，他们雇佣了他的一个一无是处的兄弟在农场上干活，虽然他们也不想让他呆在这里。这邓拉普一家是谁呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“They’re in considerable trouble down there, and they think you and Huck’ll be a kind of diversion for them—‘comfort,’ they say.Much of that they’ll get out of you and Huck Finn, I reckon.There’s a neighbor named Brace Dunlap that’s been wanting to marry their Benny for three months, and at last they told him point blank and once for all, he COULDN’T; so he has soured on them, and they’re worried about it.I reckon he’s somebody they think they better be on the good side of, for they’ve tried to please him by hiring his no-account brother to help on the farm when they can’t hardly afford it, and don’t want him around anyhow.Who are the Dunlaps?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们住在离赛拉斯叔叔家一英里远的地方，波利姑姑——所有的农民都住在离这里大约一英里远的地方——而布雷斯·邓拉普比其他人富有，还拥有许多自己的黑奴。他是一位鳏夫，三十六岁，无儿无女，他常因为有钱而颇为得意，还很专横跋扈，以至于每个人都对他有些畏惧。我认为，他觉得只要自己想要的话，他可以得到任何他喜欢的女孩，而当他发现不能得到本尼时，他就受到了不小的挫折。为什么会这样，因为本尼才只有他一半的年纪，你们见了就知道了——她很甜美可爱。可怜的赛拉斯叔叔——为什么要通过这种拍马屁的方式来取得好感，他这样子真可怜——这样子过于强求而且很可悲，何况还请了没用的丘比特·邓拉普去取悦他那个脾气暴躁的兄弟。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They live about a mile from Uncle Silas’s place, Aunt Polly—all the farmers live about a mile apart down there—and Brace Dunlap is a long sight richer than any of the others, and owns a whole grist of niggers.He’s a widower, thirty-six years old, without any children, and is proud of his money and overbearing, and everybody is a little afraid of him.I judge he thought he could have any girl he wanted, just for the asking, and it must have set him back a good deal when he found he couldn’t get Benny.Why, Benny’s only half as old as he is, and just as sweet and lovely as—well, you’ve seen her.Poor old Uncle Silas—why, it’s pitiful, him trying to curry favor that way—so hard pushed and poor, and yet hiring that useless Jubiter Dunlap to please his ornery brother.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“多么有意思的名字——丘比特！他这名字哪来的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What a name—Jubiter!Where’d he get it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这只不过是个绰号罢了。我觉得他们在很久以前就忘了他的真实名字了。他今年二十七岁，而从他第一次游泳开始他便有了这个绰号。一个学校老师在他没穿衣服时看到他左腿膝盖上有一个银币大小的褐色胎块，而在其四周还有四个稍微小点儿的印记，那老师说这让他想起了木星和其卫星；那群小孩子觉得很好玩，所以他们开始叫他丘比特，此后人们便一直称他丘比特。他人长得高，为人懒惰，行事狡猾，手段卑鄙而且胆小懦弱，但还是挺和善的。他留着一头棕色长发但没留胡子。他当时身无分文，布雷斯免费给他提供膳宿，拿自己的旧衣服给他穿,不过常奚落他。丘比特是双胞胎之一。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s only just a nickname.I reckon they’ve forgot his real name long before this.He’s twenty-seven, now, and has had it ever since the first time he ever went in swimming.The school teacher seen a round brown mole the size of a dime on his left leg above his knee, and four little bits of moles around it, when he was naked, and he said it minded him of Jubiter and his moons; and the children thought it was funny, and so they got to calling him Jubiter, and he’s Jubiter yet.He’s tall, and lazy, and sly, and sneaky, and ruther cowardly, too, but kind of good-natured, and wears long brown hair and no beard, and hasn’t got a cent, and Brace boards him for nothing, and gives him his old clothes to wear, and despises him.Jubiter is a twin.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“正如他们说的——他长得很像丘比特；不管怎么说，他过去是这个样子的，但大家已经七年没看到他了。他十九、二十岁时参与了抢劫，然后他们把他关进监狱；但他越狱往北方某个地方逃跑了。他们以前常常听到关于他抢劫盗窃的事，不过那是很多年前的事了。现在他已经死了。至少他们是这么说的。他们再也没听到他的消息了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Just exactly like Jubiter—so they say; used to was, anyway, but he hain’t been seen for seven years.He got to robbing when he was nineteen or twenty, and they jailed him; but he broke jail and got away—up North here, somers.They used to hear about him robbing and burglaring now and then, but that was years ago.He’s dead, now.At least that’s what they say.They don’t hear about him any more.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，不管怎样，她还是很担心。她说每次争吵，赛拉斯叔叔就像变了一个人一样。而邻居们也在讨论这事，可都把它怨在你叔叔身上，当然这是因为他是个牧师，以前都不会吵架。萨莉婶婶说赛拉斯叔叔不喜欢去那个让他觉得羞耻的教堂讲坛上；于是人们便开始对他态度冷淡，渐渐地他不再像以前那么受欢迎了。”</td>
