		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看上去那是件好事，不过请听我慢慢讲吧。我们——比尔·德里斯科尔和我本人——来到了亚拉巴马州的南部地区，绑架这个主意就是当时冒出来的。正如比尔后来所形容的，那是“一时鬼上身了”，可我们也是后来才明白过来的。</td>
		<td class="en">It looked like a good thing: but wait till I tell you.We were down South, in Alabama—Bill Driscoll and myself―when this kidnapping idea struck us.It was, as Bill afterward expressed it, ‘during a moment of temporary mental apparition’; but we didn’t find that out till later.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那里有个小镇，地势平坦得像块松软烤饼，当然它的名字还是叫做萨米特镇，意思是“顶峰”。镇上的居民都是些农民，他们的日子过得就像簇拥在五朔节花柱周围庆祝似的，相安无事，自得其乐。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a town down there, as flat as a flannel-cake, and called Summit, of course.It contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self-satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a Maypole.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔和我一共有大约六百美元的资金，我们还需要两千美元，就能在西部伊利诺斯州实现一项空头不动产的计划。我们在一家旅店门口的台阶上商量这件事。我们认为，半农村半城镇地区的父母都很溺爱子女，因此，再加上别的原因，在那里实施绑架计划要比在有报纸出版的地方好些，不会一有什么事，便衣记者就到处暗访煽动人们谈论这类事情。我们知道萨米特镇的居民不可能追着我们不放，最多派几个警察，也许还有几只没精打采的警犬，然后再在《农民预算周刊》上刊登一两篇谩骂的文章，仅此而已。所以说，这事看起来还不错。</td>
		<td class="en">Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars, and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot scheme in Western Illinois with.We talked it over on the front steps of the hotel.Philoprogenitiveness, says we, is strong in semi-rural communities therefore, and for other reasons, a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things.We knew that Summit couldn’t get after us with anything stronger than constables and, maybe, some lackadaisical bloodhounds and a diatribe or two in the Weekly Farmers’ Budget.So, it looked good.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们选中当地有名望的居民埃比尼泽·多塞特的独生子作为绑架对象。这位父亲很有地位但也小气，是个抵押爱好者，也是个正直苛刻的募捐盘传递者和截留者。小家伙是个十岁的男孩，脸上的雀斑像浅浮雕似的，头发的颜色和你等火车时在报摊上买的杂志封面的颜色一样。比尔和我猜想埃比尼泽会为了这两千美元的赎金去变卖家产，直到只剩一分钱。但请听我接着说。</td>
		<td class="en">We selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named Ebenezer Dorset.The father was respectable and tight, a mortgage fancier and a stern, upright collection-plate passer and forecloser.The kid was a boy of ten, with bas-relief freckles, and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news-stand when you want to catch a train.Bill and me figured that Ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent.But wait till I tell you.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >离萨米特镇大约两英里的地方有一座小山，山上有一片灌木丛，长满了浓密的雪松。后山腰上有一个洞。在那儿我们储藏了粮食。</td>
		<td class="en">About two miles from Summit was a little mountain, covered with a dense cedar brake.On the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave.There we stored provisions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天晚上太阳落山后，我们赶着辆马车经过老多塞特的宅子。那孩子就在那条街上，正向对面篱笆上的一只小猫扔石头。</td>
		<td class="en">One evening after sundown, we drove in a buggy past old Dorset’s house.The kid was in the street, throwing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，小家伙！”比尔说，“你想不想要袋糖，再到车上来兜兜风？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Hey, little boy!’ says Bill, ‘would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那孩子扔过来块砖头，正好砸在比尔的眼睛上。</td>
		<td class="en">The boy catches Bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这会让那老家伙多掏五百美元的。”比尔爬下车，说道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘That will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars,’ says Bill, climbing over the wheel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这孩子使劲反抗，就像一头次中量级的北美黑熊；不过，最终我们还是在马车底下制服了他，然后离开了。我和比尔把他弄进山洞，接着我去把马拴在了雪松林里。天黑后，我又把车赶回三英里外雇车的小村庄，然后步行回到山上。</td>
		<td class="en">That boy put up a fight like a welter-weight cinnamon bear; but, at last, we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away.We took him up to the cave, and I hitched the horse in the cedar brake.After dark I drove the buggy to the little village, three miles away, where we had hired it, and walked back to the mountain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔正把鱼胶硬膏涂在脸上划伤的地方。洞口处一块大岩石后面生着火，小男孩正望着一壶煮开的咖啡，红头发上插着两支秃鹰的尾羽。看见我进来，他用一根小棍指着我说：</td>
		<td class="en">Bill was pasting court-plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features.There was a fire burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave, and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee, with two buzzard tailfeathers stuck in his red hair.He points a stick at me when I come up, and says:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈！该死的白人，你有胆子进入平原魔王红酋长的营地吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Ha! cursed paleface, do you dare to enter the camp of Red Chief, the terror of the plains?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他现在可不闹了，”比尔说着，卷起裤腿查看他小腿上的淤青。“我们扮印第安人玩呢。我们把野牛比尔的表演演得像在市政厅里所放映的巴勒斯坦风景幻灯片一样。我是捕兽人老汉克，红酋长的俘虏，明天破晓时分就要被剥掉头皮。以杰罗尼莫起誓！那小孩踢人真疼。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘He’s all right now,’ says Bill, rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his shins.‘We’re playing Indian.We’re making Buffalo Bill’s show look like magic-lantern views of Palestine in the town hall.I’m Old Hank, the Trapper, Red Chief’s captive, and I’m to be scalped at daybreak.By Geronimo! that kid can kick hard.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >是呀，先生们，那孩子好像享受得很。露宿山洞的乐趣都让他忘记了自己就是个俘虏。他马上给我起了个名字叫蛇眼间谍，并且宣布，等他的勇士出征归来，我就要在太阳升起时被绑在火刑柱上烧死。</td>
		<td class="en">Yes, sir, that boy seemed to be having the time of his life.The fun of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself.He immediately christened me Snake-eye, the Spy, and announced that, when his braves returned from the warpath, I was to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后我们吃起晚饭来，他嘴里塞满了熏咸肉、面包和肉汁，开腔说话了。他做了个晚餐演讲，内容大致是这样的：</td>
		<td class="en">Then we had supper; and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy, and began to talk.He made a during-dinner speech something like this:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我真喜欢这里。我从来没有野营过，不过我以前有一只负鼠宠物，去年生日我九岁。我讨厌上学。老鼠把吉米·塔尔博特姑妈的花斑鸡下的十六个蛋全吃掉了。在这片树林里有真的印第安人吗？我还想要点肉汁。是那些移动的树让风刮起来的吗？我有过五只小狗。什么东西让你的鼻子这么红，汉克？我父亲有很多钱。星星是热的吗？星期六，我用鞭子揍了埃德·沃克两顿。我不喜欢小女孩。不用绳子你就逮不住蛤蟆。公牛会不会叫唤？橘子为什么是圆的？你们在这个山洞里睡觉，有床吗？阿莫斯·默里有六个脚趾。鹦鹉能说话，但是猴子和鱼不行。多少能得出十二？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I like this fine.I never camped out before; but I had a pet ‘possum once, and I was nine last birthday.I hate to go to school.Rats ate up sixteen of Jimmy Talbot’s aunt’s speckled hen’s eggs.Are there any real Indians in these woods?I want some more gravy.Does the trees moving make the wind blow?We had five puppies.What makes your nose so red, Hank?My father has lots of money.Are the stars hot?I whipped Ed Walker twice, Saturday.I don’t like girls.You dassent catch toads unless with a string.Do oxen make any noise?Why are oranges round?Have you got beds to sleep on in this cave?Amos Murray has got six toes.A parrot can talk, but a monkey or a fish can’t.How many does it take to make twelve?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >隔不了几分钟，他就想起来自己是个令人讨厌的印第安人，于是拿起树枝来复枪，蹑手蹑脚地走到洞口，伸长脖子看有没有可恶的白人来侦察。他还不时地会发出战场上那种呐喊声，这把捕兽人老汉克吓得直哆嗦。那孩子从一开始就吓着比尔了。</td>
		<td class="en">Every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky Indian, and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface.Now and then he would let out a warwhoop that made Old Hank the Trapper, shiver.That boy had Bill terrorized from the start.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“红酋长，”我对这小家伙说，“你想不想回家呀？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Red Chief,’ says I to the kid, ‘would you like to go home?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，为什么回家？”他说，“在家我没有什么可玩的。我不喜欢上学。我喜欢露营。你不会把我带回家的，蛇眼，对吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Aw, what for?’ says he.‘I don’t have any fun at home.I hate to go to school.I like to camp out.You won’t take me back home again, Snake-eye, will you?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是马上回去，”我说，“我们要在这洞里住一阵子。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Not right away,’ says I.‘We’ll stay here in the cave a while.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没问题！”他说，“那就太好啦。我长这么大还从来没这么快活过。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘All right!’ says he.‘That’ll be fine.I never had such fun in all my life.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大约十一点时我们上床睡觉了。我和比尔铺了几条宽毛毯和被子，让红酋长躺在中间睡。这样就不用担心他会跑掉了。他弄得我们三个小时不能入睡，时而跳起来，抓着他的步枪，在我和比尔的耳边尖叫道：“嘘！伙计们！”在他幼稚的想象中，正有一群亡命之徒偷偷靠近，弄得树叶沙沙作响，树枝啪啪地折断。结果，我睡得很不好，一直梦见自己被一个残暴的红头发海盗绑架了，还被用铁链拴在一棵树上。</td>
		<td class="en">We went to bed about eleven o’clock.We spread down some wide blankets and quilts and put Red Chief between us.We weren’t afraid he’d run away.He kept us awake for three hours, jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching: ‘Hist!　pard,’ in mine and Bill’s ears, as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band.At last, I fell into a troubled sleep, and dreamed that I had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天刚亮，我就被比尔一连串可怕的尖叫声惊醒了。这尖叫不是叫嚷、咆哮、嚎叫、呐喊或大声嚷嚷，反正不是从男人发声器官发出的任何声音；而更像女人看到鬼怪或毛毛虫时发出的那种不雅、吓人、难堪的尖叫。黎明时分听到一个强壮肥实而又无限绝望的男人在山洞里不能自制地尖叫，真是够让人毛骨悚然的。</td>
		<td class="en">Just at daybreak, I was awakened by a series of awful screams from Bill.They weren’t yells, or howls, or shouts, or whoops, or yawps, such as you’d expect from a manly set of vocal organs—they were simply indecent, terrifying, humiliating screams, such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars.It’s an awful thing to hear a strong, desperate, fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我跳起来看看发生了什么事。只见红酋长正骑在比尔的胸口，用一只手拧着比尔的头发。另一只手握着我们用来切熏咸肉的锋利餐刀；原来，依据昨天晚上对比尔的判决，他当真要不遗余力地剥下比尔的头皮。</td>
		<td class="en">I jumped up to see what the matter was.Red Chief was sitting on Bill’s chest, with one hand twined in Bill’s hair.In the other he had the sharp case-knife we used for slicing bacon; and he was industriously and realistically trying to take Bill’s scalp, according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我从小家伙手里把刀抢过来，让他重新躺下。但从那一刻起，比尔的精神就崩溃了。他侧身躺在床上，但只要那孩子还和我们一起，他就再也不敢合眼了。我打了一会盹，可随着日出临近，我想起红酋长说过，在太阳升起时我要被捆在火刑柱上烧死。我倒不紧张，也不害怕，可我还是坐起来把烟斗点上，侧靠在一块岩石上。</td>
		<td class="en">I got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again.But, from that moment, Bill’s spirit was broken.He laid down on his side of the bed, but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us.I dozed off for a while, but along toward sun-up I remembered that Red Chief had said I was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun.I wasn’t nervous or afraid; but I sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你起这么早干什么呀，山姆？”比尔问。</td>
		<td class="en">‘What you getting up so soon for, Sam?’ asked Bill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我？”我说，“哦，我的肩膀有点疼。我想坐起来会好一些。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Me?’ says I.‘Oh, I got a kind of a pain in my shoulder.I thought sitting up would rest it.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在说谎！”比尔说，“你怕了吧。日出时你将要被烧死，你害怕他真这么干。不过如果他能找到火柴，他确实会的。太恐怖了，山姆，不是吗？你认为会有人愿意花钱把他那样的小恶魔领回家吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You’re a liar!’ says Bill.‘You’re afraid.You was to be burned at sunrise, and you was afraid he’d do it.And he would, too, if he could find a match.Ain’t it awful, Sam?Do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然，”我说，“父母就喜欢宠爱这样闹腾的小家伙。这样吧，现在你和酋长起来做早饭，我到山顶上去察看一下。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Sure,’ said I.‘A rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on.Now, you and the Chief get up and cook breakfast, while I go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我爬上小山顶，扫视了一下附近的地方。朝萨米特镇望去，我希望能看到村里健壮的自耕农正手持长柄大镰刀和干草叉在乡间到处搜寻我们这两个胆小的绑匪。但是我只看到一片宁静的田野，上面有个人正赶着头暗褐色的骡子犁地。没有人在小河里打捞尸体，也没有信使来回奔走给张皇失措的父母带来什么音信。从外表来看，展现在我眼前的亚拉巴马这一地区只是一派还在昏睡中的乡村模样。“也许，”我自言自语道，“人们还没有发现狼已经从羊栏里把幼弱的羊羔叼走了。上帝保佑狼吧！”我说着，下山去吃早饭了。</td>
		<td class="en">I went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity.Over toward Summit I expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers.But what I saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule.Nobody was dragging the creek; no couriers dashed hither and yon, bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents.There was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of Alabama that lay exposed to my view.‘Perhaps,’ says I to myself, ‘it has not yet been discovered that the wolves have borne away the tender lambkin from the fold.Heaven help the wolves!’ says I, and I went down the mountain to breakfast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我到达山洞时，看见比尔背靠着洞壁，直喘粗气，那孩子正拿着有半个椰子那么大的一块石头威胁着要砸烂他。</td>
		<td class="en">When I got to the cave I found Bill backed up against the side of it, breathing hard, and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他把一个煮得发红的烫土豆放在我背上，”比尔解释说，“还用脚踩碎它；我扇了他几耳光。你身上带枪了吗，山姆？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘He put a red-hot boiled potato down my back,’ explained Bill, ‘and then mashed it with his foot; and I boxed his ears.Have you got a gun about you, Sam?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我从这孩子手里把石头夺下来，算是暂时结束了这场争斗。“我会修理你的，”小家伙对比尔说，“还没有哪个人打了红酋长不受惩罚的。你最好当心点！”</td>
		<td class="en">I took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument.‘I’ll fix you,’ says the kid to Bill.‘No man ever yet struck the Red Chief but what he got paid for it.You better beware!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吃完早饭，这孩子从衣服口袋里掏出一块缠着绳子的皮革，走到山洞外解开了它。</td>
		<td class="en">After breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes outside the cave unwinding it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他打算干什么？” 比尔不安地问，“你认为他不会逃跑的，是吗？山姆。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘What’s he up to now?’ says Bill, anxiously.‘You don’t think he’ll run away, do you, Sam?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不用担心，”我说，“他可不像是个爱呆在家里的孩子。”但是我们必须敲定个赎金计划。他的失踪好像还没有在萨米特镇引起什么骚动，不过可能他们还没意识到他不见了。他的家人可能以为他昨晚和简姑妈或某个邻居呆在一起了。无论怎么说，今天会有人想他的。今天晚上我们得给他老子送个信，要他拿两千美元来赎儿子。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘No fear of it,’ says I.‘He don’t seem to be much of a home body.But we’ve got to fix up some plan about the ransom.There don’t seem to be much excitement around Summit on account of his disappearance; but maybe they haven’t realized yet that he’s gone.His folks may think he’s spending the night with Aunt Jane or one of the neighbours.Anyhow, he’ll be missed today.Tonight we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时，我们听到了类似打仗的呐喊声，就像大卫打倒冠军歌利亚时会发出的那种声音。红酋长从口袋里取出来的是一条吊链，他正拿着它在头顶上转圈挥舞。</td>
		<td class="en">Just then we heard a kind of war-whoop, such as David might have emitted when he knocked out the champion Goliath.It was a sling that Red Chief had pulled out of his pocket, and he was whirling it around his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我躲闪着，而后听见一声重重的声响，接着比尔发出了叹息声，就像你卸下马鞍时马发出的声音一样。一块鸡蛋大小的黑色圆石子正好打在比尔的左耳后。他浑身瘫软，跌进火中，火上还架着一锅用来洗盘子的开水。我把他扯出来，半个小时里一直往他头上泼凉水。</td>
		<td class="en">I dodged, and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from Bill, like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off.A niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught Bill just behind his left ear.He loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes.I dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >过了一会儿，比尔坐起来摸着耳朵后面说：“山姆，你知道我最喜欢哪个圣经人物吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">By and by, Bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says: ‘Sam, do you know who my favourite Biblical character is?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“放松些，”我说，“你一会儿就会清醒的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Take it easy,’ says I.‘You’ll come to your senses presently.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是希律王，”他说，“你不会把我一个人留在这儿自己走开吧，山姆？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘King Herod,’ says he.‘You won’t go away and leave me here alone, will you, Sam?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我出去抓住那孩子，摇动他，直到他的雀斑被摇得格格作响。</td>
		<td class="en">I went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果你不老实的话，”我说，“我就马上送你回家。现在你听不听话了？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘If you don’t behave,’ says I, ‘I’ll take you straight home.Now, are you going to be good, or not?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就是闹着玩嘛，”他闷闷不乐地说，“我不是存心伤害老汉克的。可是他凭什么打我？我会老实的，蛇眼，如果你不送我回家，今天还让我玩黑侦察的话。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I was only funning,’ says he sullenly.‘I didn’t mean to hurt Old Hank.But what did he hit me for?I’ll behave, Snake-eye, if you won’t send me home, and if you’ll let me play the Black Scout today.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我可不知道这个游戏，”我说，“不过能不能玩得由你和比尔先生决定。今天他是你的玩伴。我有事要出去一会儿。现在你进来和他言归于好，为你伤害他向他道歉，否则就滚回家去，马上。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I don’t know the game,’ says I.‘That’s for you and Mr. Bill to decide.He’s your playmate for the day.I’m going away for a while, on business.Now, you come in and make friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him, or home you go, at once.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我让他和比尔握了握手，然后把比尔拉到一边，对他说我要去离山洞三英里远的白杨湾小村，打听一下在萨米特人们对这起绑架事件究竟怎么看。此外，我觉得最好当天就给多塞特老先生送去一封信，措辞强硬一些，索要赎金并规定他的付钱方式。</td>
		<td class="en">I made him and Bill shake hands, and then I took Bill aside and told him I was going to Poplar Cove, a little village three miles from the cave, and find out what I could about how the kidnapping had been regarded in Summit.Also, I thought it best to send a peremptory letter to old man Dorset that day, demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be paid.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你知道的，山姆，”比尔说，“我们俩一起玩扑克牌、制造爆炸、躲避警察、抢劫火车，一起经历地震、火灾、洪水，我始终跟你站在一起，连眼睛都不眨一下。在我们绑架这个两条腿跟冲天火箭一样的小恶魔之前，我还真没怕过。可他已经把我逼疯了。你不会让我和他呆很久吧，山姆？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You know, Sam,’ says Bill, ‘I’ve stood by you without batting an eye in earthquakes, fire and flood—in poker games, dynamite outrages, police raids, train robberies and cyclones.I never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped that two-legged skyrocket of a kid.He’s got me going.You won’t leave me long with him, will you, Sam?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我今天下午说不定什么时候就回来了，”我说，“但在我回来之前，你必须哄这孩子高兴，让他安生点儿。我们现在就给老多塞特写信。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I’ll be back some time this afternoon,’ says I.‘You must keep the boy amused and quiet till I return.And now we’ll write the letter to old Dorset.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔和我拿过纸笔就写了起来，红酋长这会身上正裹着一条毛毯，趾高气扬地来回走着，监守着洞口。比尔声泪俱下地恳求我别要两千赎金了，一千五百美元就可以了。他说：“我并不想要贬低父母对子女的感情，那是个众所周知的道德问题，但是我们是在跟人打交道，让任何一个人拿出两千美元来赎回一个四十磅重的满脸雀斑的野猫都是不近人情的。我愿意冒个一千五百块的险。差额算到我头上好了。</td>
		<td class="en">Bill and I got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while Red Chief, with a blanket wrapped around him, strutted up and down, guarding the mouth of the cave.Bill begged me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand.‘I ain’t attempting,’ says he, ‘to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection, but we’re dealing with humans, and it ain’t human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that forty-pound chunk of freckled wildcat.I’m willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred dollars.You can charge the difference up to me.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，为了让比尔放心，我同意了。于是我们一起谋划了下面这封信：</td>
		<td class="en">So, to relieve Bill, I acceded, and we collaborated a letter that ran this way:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I walked over to Poplar Cove and sat around the postoffice and store, talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade.One whiskerand says that he hears Summit is all upset on account of Elder Ebenezer Dorset’s boy having been lost or stolen.That was all I wanted to know.I bought some smoking tobacco, referred casually to the price of black-eyed peas, posted my letter surreptitiously and came away.The postmaster said the mail-carrier would come by in an hour to take the mail on to Summit.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In about half an hour I heard the bushes rustle, and Bill wabbled out into the little glade in front of the cave.Behind him was the kid, stepping softly like a scout, with a broad grin on his face.Bill stopped, took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief.The kid stopped about eight feet behind him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“山姆啊，”比尔说，“我猜你会觉得我是个叛徒，但是我管不了那些了。我是一个成年人，有阳刚之气，也有自我保护的习惯，可这阵子，所有的自尊和优越感都瓦解了。这孩子走了。我把他打发回家了，一切都结束了。古代有殉道者，”比尔继续说，“他们宁愿死也不愿意放弃靠不正当手段到手的钱财。可他们中还没有任何人受过我所经历的这种异常的蹂躏。我曾极力地想忠于我们约定的抢劫条款，但那也是有极限的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Sam,’ says Bill, ‘I suppose you’ll think I’m a renegade, but I couldn’t help it.I’m a grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of self-defence, but there is a time when all systems of egotism and predominance fail.The boy is gone.I have sent him home.All is off.There was martyrs in old times,’ goes on Bill, ‘that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they enjoyed.None of ‘em ever was subjugated to such supernatural tortures as I have been.I tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation; but there came a limit.’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘I was rode,’ says Bill, ‘the ninety miles to the stockade, not barring an inch.Then, when the settlers was rescued, I was given oats.Sand ain’t a palatable substitute.And then, for an hour I had to try to explain to him why there was nothin’ in holes, how a road can run both ways and what makes the grass green.I tell you, Sam, a human can only stand so much.I takes him by the neck of his clothes and drags him down the mountain.On the way he kicks my legs black-and-blue from the knees down; and I’ve got two or three bites on my thumb and hand cauterized.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过他已经走了，”比尔继续说，“滚回家了。我告诉他回萨米特镇的路，还一脚把他踢了八英尺远，这就离那儿更近了。我很抱歉我弄丢了这笔赎金，但是不这样做，就只有比尔·德里斯科尔进疯人院了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But he’s gone’—continues Bill—'gone home.I showed him the road to Summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick.I’m sorry we lose the ransom; but it was either that or Bill Driscoll to the madhouse.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔一直气喘吁吁的，但他那浅玫瑰红色的脸上流露着不可言喻的平静和日渐显露的得意。</td>
		<td class="en">Bill is puffing and blowing, but there is a look of ineffable peace and growing content on his rose-pink features.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比尔，”我问道，“你的家人中有没有得心脏病的？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Bill,’ says I, ‘there isn’t any heart disease in your family, is there?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有，”比尔说，“只有疟疾和意外事故，没有任何慢性病。怎么了？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘No,’ says Bill, ‘nothing chronic except malaria and accidents.Why?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你可以回过头去，”我说，“看看你后面。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Then you might turn around,’ says I, ‘and have a look behind you.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比尔转过头，看到了那孩子，他顿时面无血色，一屁股坐在地上，开始漫无目的地拔着草和小树枝。足足一个小时，我都在担心他的神志。然后，我告诉他我的大计马上就能摆平这件事，如果老多塞特答应我们的条件，到午夜我们就能拿到赎金，然后远走高飞。比尔这才重新鼓起勇气，冲那孩子勉强一笑，并承诺一旦他感觉好点，就跟他玩日俄战争的游戏，他会扮演俄国人。</td>
		<td class="en">Bill turns and sees the boy, and loses his complexion and sits down plump on the ground and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks.For an hour I was afraid for his mind.And then I told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old Dorset fell in with our proposition.So Bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the Russian in a Japanese war with him as soon as he felt a little better.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我有个计划，能既拿到赎金又不落入反间计，这招应该会受到职业绑架者欢迎的。放回信，也就是晚一会放钱的那棵树是紧挨着路边的栅栏的，而且四周都是成片的旷野。如果一大群警察在观察来取信的人，他们老远就能看到他穿过田野或者走在路上。但是没有那么简单，先生！我会在八点半时爬上树，像雨蛙一样好好藏着，等送信的人来。</td>
		<td class="en">I had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being caught by counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional kidnappers.The tree under which the answer was to be left—and the money later on—was close to the road fence with big, bare fields on all sides.If a gang of constables should be watching for any one to come for the note they could see him a long way off crossing the fields or in the road.But no, sirree!At half-past eight I was up in that tree as well hidden as a tree toad, waiting for the messenger to arrive.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >刚刚到时间，一个未成年小伙子就骑着自行车往这条路上来了，他找到围栏柱底下的纸盒，放进一张折叠的纸条，然后再次骑上车回萨米特镇去了。</td>

		<td class="en">I waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square.I slid down the tree, got the note, slipped along the fence till I struck the woods, and was back at the cave in another half an hour.I opened the note, got near the lantern and read it to Bill.It was written with a pen in a crabbed hand, and the sum and substance of it was this:</td></tr>
