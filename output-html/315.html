		<td class="en">Rosemary Fell was not exactly beautiful.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >真的，你不能称她为漂亮。长得标致吗？这个嘛，如果你把她的五官拆开，单看她的每一部分……可是，我们干吗要如此狠心,非得把人家的五官拆开来看呢？她年轻、聪颖，非常新潮，穿着考究，读过无数最新出版的书。她结交的人可以形成一个绝佳组合，不是真正的重要人物，就是……艺术家们——稀奇古怪的人物，都是她物色的，他们当中有一些人怪异得难以形容，不过有一些倒也很体面，很风趣。</td>
		<td class="en">No, you couldn’t have called her beautiful.Pretty?Well, if you took her to pieces...But why be so cruel as to take anyone to pieces?She was young, brilliant, extremely modem, exquisitely well dressed, amazingly well read in the newest of the new books, and her parties were the most delicious mixture of the really important people and... artists—quaint creatures, discoveries of hers, some of them too terrifying for words, but others quite presentable and amusing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗斯玛丽结婚已经两年了。她有一个宝贝儿子。不，不叫彼得，叫迈克尔。她的丈夫极其宠她。他们很富有，是真正的富有。不是那种一般的富裕，那种听起来像祖父母那样，让人厌倦、乏味的生活。如果罗斯玛丽想要去购物，她就会去巴黎，就像你我会去邦德街一样。如果她想买花，车就把她送到摄政街最好的花店。在那家店里她会用她那令人倾倒的外国派头端详着，然后说：“我要那些，那些，还有那些。那种花给我来四束。还有那瓶玫瑰。对，那瓶里的玫瑰我全要。不，不要紫丁香。我讨厌紫丁香。样子太难看。”店员点头哈腰，把紫丁香拿走了，仿佛紫丁香真的就如她所说得那样非常难看。“我还要那些短秆的小郁金香。那些红的和白的我都要。”她买完这些花就朝车走去，一个瘦瘦的女店员跌跌撞撞地跟在她后面，怀里抱着一大把白纸包，就像抱着一个穿长衣的小孩。</td>
		<td class="en">Rosemary had been married two years.She had a duck of a boy.No, not Peter—Michael.And her husband absolutely adored her.They were rich, really rich, not just comfortably well off, which is odious and stuffy and sounds like one’s grandparents.But if Rosemary wanted to shop she would go to Paris as you and I would go to Bond Street.If she wanted to buy flowers, the car pulled up at that perfect shop in Regent Street, and Rosemary inside the shop just gazed in her dazzled, rather exotic way, and said: “I want those and those and those.Give me four bunches of those.And that jar of roses.Yes, I’ll have all the roses in the jar.No, no lilac.I hate lilac.It’s got no shape.” The attendant bowed and put the lilac out of sight, as though this was only too true; lilac was dreadfully shapeless.“Give me those stumpy little tulips.Those red and white ones.” And she was followed to the car by a thin shop-girl staggering under an immense white paper armful that looked like a baby in long clothes....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个冬日的下午，她正在柯曾街一家小古玩店里买东西。这家店铺她很喜欢。一方面，每个人都有自己的爱好。另一方面，经营这家店铺的老板也很喜欢为她服务。她一来，这个老板总是笑容满面的。他会紧握双手，高兴得几乎说不出话来。这当然是恭维。不管怎样，总有些……</td>
		<td class="en">One winter afternoon she had been buying something in a little antique shop in Curzon Street.It was a shop she liked.For one thing, one usually had it to oneself.And then the man who kept it was ridiculously fond of serving her.He beamed whenever she came in.He clasped his hands; he was so gratified he could scarcely speak.Flattery, of course.All the same, there was something...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫人，您看。”他会用谦卑恭敬的口气解释道，“我真喜欢我这些东西。要是把它们卖给不懂得欣赏的人，我宁可不卖。现在识货的人真是太少了……”接着，他深吸了一口气，展开一块蓝色丝绒小方巾，用苍白的指尖把它铺在玻璃柜台上。</td>
		<td class="en">“You see, madam,” he would explain in his low respectful tones, “I love my things.I would rather not part with them than sell them to someone who does not appreciate them, who has not that fine feeling which is so rare...” And, breathing deeply, he unrolled a tiny square of blue velvet and pressed it on the glass counter with his pale finger-tips.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >今天的货是个小盒子。他特地为她留的。他到目前为止还没拿给任何人看过。这是一个小巧别致的瓷釉盒子，釉面像是在奶油里烤过那般细腻。盒盖上，一棵开满花的树下站着一个小巧的男孩，还有一个更为小巧的女孩在用双臂搂着他的脖子。她的帽子挂在一根树枝上，还没有天竺葵的花瓣大。帽子上还有绿丝带。在两个小人儿的头顶上飘浮着一片粉红的云朵，像个专注的小天使。罗斯玛丽摘下长手套。仔细把玩这类东西时，她总是要摘下手套。是的，她真是太喜欢它了。这令她爱不释手，真是个好东西。她一定要买下它。她把这奶油般柔滑的盒子转来转去，打开又关上。她不由自主地注意到在蓝丝绒的衬托下，自己的双手真的很是迷人。或许在他脑海的幽深之处，老板也在偷偷地这么想。因为他拿起一支铅笔，身子俯过柜台，然后胆怯地把自己那苍白、没有血色的手指移到对方光滑红润的手指旁，柔和地低声道：“容我把这小妇人紧身胸衣上的花指出给夫人您看。”</td>
		<td class="en">Today it was a little box.He had been keeping it for her.He had shown it to nobody as yet.An exquisite little enamel box with a glaze so fine it looked as though it had been baked in cream.On the lid a minute creature stood under a flowery tree, and a more minute creature still had her arms round his neck.Her hat, really no bigger than a geranium petal, hung from a branch; it had green ribbons.And there was a pink cloud like a watchful cherub floating above their heads.Rosemary took her hands out of her long gloves.She always took off her gloves to examine such things.Yes, she liked it very much.She loved it; it was a great duck.She must have it.And, turning the creamy box, opening and shutting it, she couldn’t help noticing how charming her hands were against the blue velvet.The shopman, in some dim cavern of his mind, may have dared to think so too.For he took a pencil, leant over the counter, and his pale, bloodless fingers crept timidly towards those rosy, flashing ones, as he murmured gently: “If I may venture to point out to madam, the flowers on the little lady’s bodice.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真美啊！”罗斯玛丽很喜欢这些花，“不过，要多少钱？”有一阵子老板像是没听到她说的话。过了一会儿，才听到他低声的回答。“二十八几尼，夫人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Charming!” Rosemary admired the flowers.“But what was the price?”For a moment the shopman did not seem to hear.Then a murmur reached her.“Twenty-eight guineas, madam.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“二十八几尼。”罗斯玛丽没有要买的意思。她放下了小盒，再次把手套戴上。二十八几尼。哪怕是富裕的人……她面无表情，眼睛一直盯着一把圆鼓鼓的茶壶。那茶壶就像一只胖墩墩的母鸡，蹲在老板的脑袋上。她回答的声音很是恍惚：“好，给我留着,行吗？回头，我会……”</td>
		<td class="en">“Twenty-eight guineas.” Rosemary gave no sign.She laid the little box down; she buttoned her gloves again.Twenty-eight guineas.Even if one is rich...She looked vague. She stared at a plump tea-kettle like a plump hen above the shopman’s head, and her voice was dreamy as she answered: “Well, keep it for me—will you?I’ll...”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老板早已点头哈腰，仿佛为她留着这个小玩意是件无比荣幸、求之不得的事。他当然愿意为她留着，永远留着也行。</td>
		<td class="en">But the shopman had already bowed as though keeping it for her was all any human being could ask.He would be willing, of course, to keep it for her for ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >咔嗒一声，那扇不起眼的店门关上了。她站在店铺外面的台阶上，望着冬日下午的天色。下雨了，一下雨，天似乎也黑下来了，黑暗宛如灰烬般打着旋儿撒落了下来。空气里透着刺骨的寒意，刚亮起的路灯看上去有些昏暗。对面屋子里的灯光也昏暗无比。这些灯朦朦胧胧地亮着，仿佛在惋惜着什么。行人躲在讨厌的雨伞下匆匆而过。罗斯玛丽感到莫名的惆怅．她用手套捂着胸口，恨不得把那个小盒子也紧紧地抓在怀里。当然，车已经停在那里了。她只需走过人行道。不过，她还是在那儿等着。人生中会有这样一些糟糕的时刻，那就是，当你站在屋檐下朝外张望时，看到外面的景象糟糕透顶。不过，不应就此妥协。应该回家，喝点上好的茶。正想着，一个又黑又瘦的年轻姑娘——不知从哪里来的——像幽灵般出现在罗斯玛丽的身旁。她像是叹息又像是哭泣地喘息道：“我可以跟您说句话吗，夫人？”</td>
		<td class="en">The discreet door shut with a click.She was outside on the step, gazing at the winter afternoon.Rain was falling, and with the rain it seemed the dark came too, spinning down like ashes.There was a cold bitter taste in the air, and the new-lighted lamps looked sad.Sad were the lights in the houses opposite.Dimly they burned as if regretting something.And people hurried by, hidden under their hateful umbrellas.Rosemary felt a strange pang.She pressed her muff against her breast; she wished she had the little box, too, to cling to.Of course the car was there.She’d only to cross the pavement.But still she waited.There are moments, horrible moments in life, when one emerges from shelter and looks out, and it’s awful.One oughtn’t to give way to them.One ought to go home and have an extra-special tea.But at the very instant of thinking that, a young girl, thin, dark, shadowy—where had she come from?—was standing at Rosemary’s elbow and a voice like a sigh, almost like a sob, breathed: “Madam, may I speak to you a moment?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“跟我吗？”罗斯玛丽转过身来。她看到一个衣衫褴褛的小女人，长着大大的眼睛，很年轻，和自己的年龄相仿，正用通红的双手捂着衣领，哆嗦着，像是刚从水里捞出来似的。</td>
		<td class="en">“Speak to me?” Rosemary turned.She saw a little battered creature with enormous eyes, someone quite young, no older than herself, who clutched at her coat-collar with reddened hands, and shivered as though she had just come out of the water.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫——夫人。”她的声音磕磕巴巴。“能给我买一杯茶的钱吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“M—madam,” stammered the voice.“Would you let me have the price of a cup of tea?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一杯茶？”这声音听上去真诚而单纯，一点也不像一个乞讨者的声音。“那你一点钱也没有？”罗斯玛丽问。</td>
		<td class="en">“A cup of tea?” There was something simple, sincere in that voice; it wasn’t in the least the voice of a beggar.“Then have you no money at all?” asked Rosemary.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一点也没有，夫人。”她答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“None, madam,” came the answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“多奇特啊！”罗斯玛丽透过这暮色望着小姑娘，小姑娘也盯着她。何止奇特！突然间，罗斯玛丽觉得这似乎就是一场奇遇。这薄暮之中的相遇有点像陀思妥耶夫斯基一篇小说里的情节。假如她把这小姑娘带回家会怎么样呢？假如她真的做一件她总是在书里读到或在舞台上看到的那些事，结果会怎样呢？那一定很刺激。事后她会对自己那些诧异的朋友说：“我就这样把她带回了家。”她走上前，对身边那个昏暗的人影说：“跟我回家喝茶吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“How extraordinary!” Rosemary peered through the dusk and the girl gazed back at her.How more than extraordinary! And suddenly it seemed to Rosemary such an adventure.It was like something out of a novel by Dostoevsky, this meeting in the dusk.Supposing she took the girl home?Supposing she did do one of those things she was always reading about or seeing on the stage, what would happen?It would be thrilling.And she heard herself saying afterwards to the amazement of her friends: “I simply took her home with me,” as she stepped forward and said to that dim person beside her: “Come home to tea with me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >姑娘惊讶地往后退了退。她甚至一时之间停止了抖动。罗斯玛丽伸出一只手拉住姑娘的胳膊。“我不骗你。”她笑着说。她觉得，自己笑得是那么真诚，那么和蔼。“为什么不跟我去呢？走吧！跟我回家去，喝杯茶，车就在那儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">The girl drew back startled.She even stopped shivering for a moment.Rosemary put out a hand and touched her arm.“I mean it,” she said, smiling.And she felt how simple and kind her smile was.“Why won’t you?Do.Come home with me now in my car and have tea.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您——您不会骗我吧，夫人！”小姑娘说，她的声音里流露着痛苦。</td>
		<td class="en">“You—you don’t mean it, madam,” said the girl, and there was pain in her voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我没骗你。”罗斯玛丽喊道。“我想让你来。来陪陪我。来吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But I do,” cried Rosemary.“I want you to.To please me.Come along.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >姑娘把手指放到嘴唇上，眼睛直直地盯着罗斯玛丽。“您——您不会是要把我送到警局吧？”她结结巴巴地说。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl put her fingers to her lips and her eyes devoured Rosemary.“You’re—you’re not taking me to the police station?” she stammered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“警局？”罗斯玛丽大笑起来。“我为什么要那么狠心啊？不，我只想让你暖暖身子，听你说说话——随你说什么都行。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The police station!” Rosemary laughed out.“Why should I be so cruel?No, I only want to make you warm and to hear—anything you care to tell me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >饥饿的人是很容易上钩的。随从打开了车门，片刻之后他们就消失在暮色中。</td>
		<td class="en">Hungry people are easily led.The footman held the door of the car open, and a moment later they were skimming through the dusk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“到了！”罗斯玛丽说道。罗斯玛丽把手伸到丝绒皮带里，有一种凯旋而归的感觉。看着自己捕回来的小猎物，她很想说，“这下我可逮住你了。”不过当然，她这样说是出于好意。哎，远不止好意。她还想让这个姑娘看看——生活中确实会发生一些奇事——神话中的仙女是有的，富人也有热心肠，女人家都是姐妹。她转过身，有些冲动地说道：“不要怕。你究竟为什么不愿跟我回家呢？我们都是女人。我只不过比你有些福分罢了，你也应该指望……”</td>
		<td class="en">“There!” said Rosemary.She had a feeling of triumph as she slipped her hand through the velvet strap.She could have said, “Now I’ve got you,” as she gazed at the little captive she had netted.But of course she meant it kindly.Oh, more than kindly.She was going to prove to this girl that—wonderful things did happen in life, that—fairy godmothers were real, that—rich people had hearts, and that women were sisters.She turned impulsively, saying’.“Don’t be frightened.After all, why shouldn’t you come back with me?We’re both women.If I’m the more fortunate, you ought to expect...”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是让人高兴的是此时车正好停了下来，要不然她还真不知该如何结束这句话。一按门铃，门就开了，罗斯玛丽用优雅的姿势，护着那姑娘，几乎是搂搂抱抱地把她拉进了大厅。大厅里温暖、柔和、明亮，一股清香迎面扑来。她对这一切已习以为常，从来不放在心上。她更愿意看着别人领略这一切。这大厅真令人着迷。这个小东西就像富家的小姑娘走进了她自己的小房间一样，有吃有喝，有玩有乐。</td>
		<td class="en">But happily at that moment, for she didn’t know how the sentence was going to end, the car stopped.The bell was rung, the door opened, and with a charming, protecting, almost embracing movement, Rosemary drew the other into the hall.Warmth, softness, light, a sweet scent, all those things so familiar to her she never even thought about them, she watched that other receive.It was fascinating.She was like the rich little girl in her nursery with all the cupboards to open, all the boxes to unpack.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来，到楼上来。”罗斯玛丽急切地摆出一副慷慨的样子。“到我房间来。”她这样做，也是不想让佣人老盯着这个小可怜虫看。所以上楼的时候，她就打定了主意，连珍妮也不叫，自己更衣。自然些才是最重要的！</td>
		<td class="en">“Come, come upstairs,” said Rosemary, longing to begin to be generous.“Come up to my room.” And, besides, she wanted to spare this poor little thing from being stared at by the servants; she decided as they mounted the stairs she would not even ring to Jeanne, but take off her things by herself.The great things were to be natural!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“到了！”走进华丽宽敞的卧房，罗斯玛丽再次喊了出来。此时卧房里已拉上了窗帘，在熊熊炉火的照耀下，她那精美的漆木家具、金色的靠背、淡黄色和蓝色相间的地毯都在闪闪发光。</td>
		<td class="en">And “There!” cried Rosemary again, as they reached her beautiful big bedroom with the curtains drawn, the fire leaping on her wonderful lacquer furniture, her gold cushions and the primrose and blue rugs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >姑娘一进卧房门就愣住了，她看上去有些眩晕。可罗斯玛丽对此并不介意。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl stood just inside the door; she seemed dazed.But Rosemary didn’t mind that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来，快坐。”她边喊边把她的大椅子拖到火炉边，“这椅子舒服，来，暖和暖和。感觉你冻坏了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Come and sit down,” she cried, dragging her big chair up to the fire, “in this comfy chair.  Come and get warm.You look so dreadfully cold.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫人，我不敢。”姑娘边说边后退。</td>
		<td class="en">“I daren’t, madam,” said the girl, and she edged backwards.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，过来吧！”——罗斯玛丽跑上前去——“你不要怕，真的不要怕。坐下吧！我换一下衣服，然后我们就到隔壁去喝茶，舒服一下。你怕什么？”她有些推搡地把这个瘦小的人儿推进那把大摇椅里。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, please,”—Rosemary ran forward—“you mustn’t be frightened, you mustn’t, really.Sit down, when I’ve taken off my things we shall go into the next room and have tea and be cozy.Why are you afraid?” And gently she half pushed the thin figure into its deep cradle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，她却没有反应。她就那样一动不动地坐着，手放在两边，嘴微微张着。说实话，她看上去有点笨。可罗斯玛丽却不这么认为。她弯下腰来问她：</td>
		<td class="en">But there was no answer.The girl stayed just as she had been put, with her hands by her sides and her mouth slightly open.To be quite sincere, she looked rather stupid.But Rosemary wouldn’t acknowledge it.She leant over her, saying:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不把帽子摘下来吗？漂亮的头发都湿了。不戴帽子，人就舒服多了，是吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Won’t you take off your hat?Your pretty hair is all wet.And one is so much more comfortable without a hat, isn’t one?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后只听到她低低的耳语声，像是说“好，夫人。”接着，那顶揉得皱巴巴的帽子就被摘了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a whisper that sounded like “Very good, madam,” and the crushed hat was taken off.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我帮你把外套也脱了吧。”罗斯玛丽说。</td>
		<td class="en">“And let me help you off with your coat, too,” said Rosemary.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那姑娘站起身来。但她一只手扶着椅子，让罗斯玛丽拉。真够费劲的。姑娘一点也不帮罗斯玛丽使劲。她就像一个孩子似的站不稳脚跟。这时罗斯玛丽就想，如果你要别人帮忙，你多少对别人的帮忙要有点反应才对，哪怕一点点也行，否则，帮你就太难了。现在她要怎么处理这件外套呢？她把它和那顶帽子一起扔到了地上。她刚要从壁炉上拿支烟，那姑娘却开口说话，说得很快，声音有些小，却很怪异：“对不起，夫人，我快晕过去了。不吃点东西，我就不行了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The girl stood up.But she held on to the chair with one hand and let Rosemary pull.It was quite an effort.The other scarcely helped her at all.She seemed to stagger like a child, and the thought came and went through Rosemary’s mind, that if people wanted helping they must respond a little, just a little, otherwise it became very difficult indeed.And what was she to do with the coat now?She left it on the floor, and the hat too.She was just going to take a cigarette off the mantelpiece when the girl said quickly, but so lightly and strangely: “I’m very sorry, madam, but I’m going to faint.I shall go off, madam, if I don’t have something.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天哪，瞧我多粗心！”罗斯玛丽急忙去按铃。</td>
		<td class="en">“Good heavens, how thoughtless I am!” Rosemary rushed to the bell.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“茶，快拿茶，再倒点白兰地，马上！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tea! Tea at once! And some brandy immediately!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >佣人又离开了，可姑娘几乎大喊起来：“不，不要白兰地。我从不喝白兰地。我只要一杯茶，夫人。”她满眼泪水。</td>
		<td class="en">The maid was gone again, but the girl almost cried out: “No, I don’t want no brandy.I never drink brandy.It’s a cup of tea I want, madam.” And she burst into tears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时真是让人又惊又喜。罗斯玛丽跪在她坐的椅子旁边。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a terrible and fascinating moment.Rosemary knelt beside her chair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别哭了，小可怜虫。”她说，“别哭了。”她给姑娘递过去一块花边手绢。自己却有一种不可名状的感动。她用胳膊搂住姑娘那瘦得如同小鸟一样的双肩。</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t cry, poor little thing,” she said.“Don’t cry.” And she gave the other her lace handkerchief.She really was touched beyond words.She put her arm round those thin, bird-like shoulders.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时姑娘终于忘了羞怯，忘了一切，只记得她们都是女人。她喘息着说道：“我不能再这样下去了。我受不了。受不了。去死了算了。我再也受不了了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Now at last the other forgot to be shy, forgot everything except that they were both women, and gasped out: “I can’t go on no longer like this.I can’t bear it.I can’t bear it.I shall do away with myself.I can’t bear no more.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你别这样。我会照顾你的。别再哭了。你看，你遇到了我，这不是一件好事吗？咱们先喝茶，然后你把你的一切都告诉我。我会为你做主的。我向你保证。快别哭了。哭会伤了身子。快。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You shan’t have to.I’ll look after you.Don’t cry any more.Don’t you see what a good thing it was that you met me?We’ll have tea and you’ll tell me everything.And I shall arrange something.I promise.Do stop crying.It’s so exhausting.Please!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她真的就不哭了。罗斯玛丽刚要起身，茶就端了上来。她让佣人把茶桌放在她俩中间。所有的东西她都让这个小可怜虫吃，什么三明治呀、黄油面包呀，都给了她。杯子空了，她马上给她添茶，还加上奶油和糖。人们都说糖是很有营养的。至于自己，她没吃。她抽着烟，有意看着别的地方，好让那姑娘不会感到害羞。</td>
		<td class="en">The other did stop just in time for Rosemary to get up before the tea came.She had the table placed between them.She plied the poor little creature with everything, all the sandwiches, all the bread and butter, and every time her cup was empty she filled it with tea, cream and sugar.People always said sugar was so nourishing.As for herself she didn’t eat; she smoked and looked away tactfully so that the other should not be shy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可别小瞧这顿小茶点，它的功效可大着呢。茶桌拿走后，她就跟换了一个人似的。虽说弱不禁风，头发蓬乱，但嘴唇却有了些血色，一对深陷的眼睛闪闪发亮，她倚靠在那把大椅子里，望着炉火，充满了甜美的倦意。罗斯玛丽又点燃一支烟，是到了该说点什么的时候了。</td>
		<td class="en">And really the effect of that slight meal was marvelous.When the tea-table was carried away a new being, a light, frail creature with tangled hair, dark lips, deep, lighted eyes, lay back in the big chair in a kind of sweet languor, looking at the blaze.Rosemary lit a fresh cigarette; it was time to begin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你上一次吃饭是什么时候？”她柔声问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“And when did you have your last meal?” she asked softly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是这时，门把手转动了。</td>
		<td class="en">But at that moment the door-handle turned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“罗斯玛丽，我能进去吗？”这是菲利普的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">“Rosemary, may I come in?” It was Philip.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然可以进来了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Of course.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是菲利普就进来了。“哦，不好意思。”他说着，瞪大眼睛站在那儿。</td>
		<td class="en">He came in.“Oh, I’m so sorry,” he said, and stopped and stared.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来得正好。”罗斯玛丽笑道，“这是我的朋友，叫——”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s quite all right,” said Rosemary, smiling.“This is my friend, Miss—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“史密斯，夫人。”那个倦怠的人说道。此时，她出奇地镇静，一点也不怕了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Smith, madam,” said the languid figure, who was strangely still and unafraid.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“史密斯小姐。”罗斯玛丽说。“我俩正打算聊天呢。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，好吧。”菲利普说道。“非常好。”同时他看见了扔在地上的衣服和帽子。他来到火炉边，背对着火炉。“今天下午的天气真糟。”他纳闷地说道，眼睛仍盯着那个倦怠的人，看了看她的手和靴子，然后又看了看罗斯玛丽。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh yes,” said Philip.“Quite,” and his eye caught sight of the coat and hat on the floor.He came over to the fire and turned his back to it.“It’s a beastly afternoon,” he said curiously, still looking at that listless figure, looking at its hands and boots, and then at Rosemary again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可不是嘛。”罗斯玛丽热切地答道。“糟透了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, isn’t it?” said Rosemary enthusiastically.“Vile.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >菲利普笑了，笑得很迷人。“其实我是——”他说，“你跟我到书房来一下，好吗？</td>
		<td class="en">Philip smiled his charming smile.“As a matter of fact,” said he, “I wanted you to come into the library for a moment. Would you?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >史密斯小姐，你不会见怪吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">Will Miss Smith excuse us?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她抬起她的大眼睛望着他，不过罗斯玛丽已代她答道：“她当然不会的。”于是他们一同走出了卧室。</td>
		<td class="en">The big eyes were raised to him, but Rosemary answered for her: “Of course she will.” And they went out of the room together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我说。”只有他们夫妻俩的时候，菲利普说道。“解释一下吧。她是谁？这是怎么回事？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I say,” said Philip, when they were alone.“Explain.Who is she?What does it all mean?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗斯玛丽倚着门，笑着说：“我在柯曾街碰到她的。真的，是真正的偶遇。她向我讨要一杯茶钱，我就把她带回了家。”</td>
		<td class="en">Rosemary, laughing, leaned against the door and said: “I picked her up in Curzon Street.Really.She’s a real pick-up.She asked me for the price of a cup of tea, and I brought her home with me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是你把她带回家到底要做什么？”菲利普嚷道。</td>
		<td class="en">“But what on earth are you going to do with her?” cried Philip.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“待她好点。”罗斯玛丽迅速地答道。“要非常友好地对待她。照顾她。我也不知自己怎么回事。我们还没交谈呢。不过还是给她——对她——让她感觉——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Be nice to her,” said Rosemary quickly.“Be frightfully nice to her.Look after her.I don’t know how.We haven’t talked yet.But show her—treat her—make her feel—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的宝贝儿。”菲利普说道，“你是疯了，你知不知道。你根本就不能这么做。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My darling girl,” said Philip, “you’re quite mad, you know.It simply can’t be done.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就知道你会这么说。”罗斯玛丽反驳道。“为什么不行？我就想这么做。难道这不是理由吗？还有，在书里总是能读到这种事。我决定——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I knew you’d say that,” retorted Rosemary.Why not?I want to.Isn’t that a reason?And besides, one’s always reading about these things.I decided—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过。”菲利普掐断雪茄烟头，慢条斯理地说，“她倒是美得惊人啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">“But,” said Philip slowly, and he cut the end of a cigar, “she’s so astonishingly pretty.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“美？”罗斯玛丽惊讶得脸都红了。“你真的这么认为？我——我倒没有这么想。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pretty?” Rosemary was so surprised that she blushed.“Do you think so?I—I hadn’t thought about it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天哪！”菲利普划了一根火柴。“她真的很可爱。你再好好看看，宝贝儿。刚才一进你的房间我都惊呆了。不过……我想你是大错特错了。亲爱的，要是我有些粗鲁或有什么不对的，别见怪。不过，你要让我知道，史密斯小姐是否能赶得上和我们一起吃晚饭，这样好让我有时间看看《妇女时装杂志》。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good Lord!” Philip struck a match.“She’s absolutely lovely.Look again, my child.I was bowled over when I came into your room just now.However...I think you’re making a ghastly mistake.Sorry, darling, if I’m crude and all that.But let me know if Miss Smith is going to dine with us in time for me to look up The Milliner’s Gazette.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你这荒唐鬼！”罗斯玛丽说着就走出书房，不过她没返回卧房。她去了自己的书房，坐在了书桌前。美！真的可爱！惊呆了！她的心怦怦直跳，像口大钟在敲。美！可爱！她拿过自己的支票簿。但是不行，支票没用，肯定没用。她拉开抽屉，拿出五英镑，看了看，又放回了两张，捏着剩下的三张，她回到了自己的卧室。</td>
		<td class="en">“You absurd creature!” said Rosemary, and she went out of the library, but not back to her bedroom.She went to her writing-room and sat down at her desk.Pretty! Absolutely lovely! Bowled over! Her heart beat like a heavy bell.Pretty! Lovely! She drew her check-book towards her.But no, checks would be no use, of course.She opened a drawer and took out five pound notes, looked at them, put two back, and holding the three squeezed in her hand, she went back to her bedroom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >半个小时之后，当罗斯玛丽来到藏书室，菲利普仍呆在那里。</td>
		<td class="en">Half an hour later Philip was still in the library, when Rosemary came in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我只想告诉你。”她倚着门，一副令人倾倒的外国派头，看着他说，“史密斯小姐今晚不跟我们吃饭了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I only wanted to tell you,” said she, and she leaned against the door again and looked at him with her dazzled exotic gaze, “Miss Smith won’t dine with us tonight.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >菲利普放下报纸。“哦，怎么回事？事先有约会？”</td>
		<td class="en">Philip put down the paper.“Oh, what’s happened?Previous engagement?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗斯玛丽走过来坐在他的膝盖上。“她坚持要走。”她说，“所以我给那小可怜虫拿了点现钱。她要走我也不能执意留她，是不是？”她又柔声补了一句。</td>
		<td class="en">Rosemary came over and sat down on his knee.“She insisted on going,” said she, “so I gave the poor little thing a present of money.I couldn’t keep her against her will, could I?” she added softly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗斯玛丽刚刚做过头发，又画了眼线，还戴上了珍珠项链。她伸出双手，捧着菲利普的脸颊。</td>
		<td class="en">Rosemary had just done her hair, darkened her eyes a little and put on her pearls.She put up her hands and touched Philip’s cheeks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你喜欢我吗？”她问道，娇滴滴的、有些沙哑的声音让他有些不安。</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you like me?” said she, and her tone, sweet, husky, troubled him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我很喜欢你。”他说着把她搂更紧了。“吻我。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I like you awfully,” he said, and he held her tighter.“Kiss me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >过了一会儿。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a pause.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Then Rosemary said dreamily: “I saw a fascinating little box to-day.It cost twenty-eight guineas.May I have it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >菲利普用膝盖颤着她。“好吧！你这个爱花钱的小东西。”他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">Philip jumped her on his knee.“You may, little wasteful one,” said he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过这不是罗斯玛丽真正想问的话。</td>
		<td class="en">But that was not really what Rosemary wanted to say.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“菲利普。”她把他的头拢到自己的胸前，低语道，“我好看吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Philip,” she whispered, and she pressed his head against her bosom, “am I pretty?” </td></tr>
