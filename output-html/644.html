		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时间是八月二日，晚上九点。这是世界历史上最可怕的一个八月[^1]，周遭的一切凝神敛息，闷热凝滞的空气中弥漫着一种模模糊糊的预感，让人油然想到，上帝的诅咒马上就会降临这个堕落的世界。太阳早已落山，远远的西方却低低地横亘着一抹殷红的残霞，宛如一道未愈的伤口。上方是熠熠生辉的群星，下方则是海湾里来往船只的闪烁灯火。两位著名的德国人伫立在花园小径的石栏旁边，身后是一座又长又矮、山墙林立的房屋。他俩正在俯瞰下方的宽广海滩，所在的地方则是一堵白垩巨崖的顶端，四年之前，冯·博克把自己的家安在了这里，如同一只离群孤栖的老鹰。两个人把脑袋凑在一起，正在窃窃私语。他俩都在吸雪茄，若是你从下方往上看，两个红光闪烁的雪茄烟头就像是一双烟焰缭绕的恶魔之眼，正在透过黑暗俯视着你。</td>
		<td class="en">It was nine o’clock at night upon the second of August—the most terrible August in the history of the world. One might have thought already that God’s curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectation in the sultry and stagnant air. The sun had long set, but one bloodred gash like an open wound lay low in the distant west. Above, the stars were shining brightly, and below, the lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay. The two famous Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden walk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house behind them, and they looked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great chalk cliff on which Von Bork, like some wandering eagle, had perched himself four years before. They stood with their heads close together, talking in low, confidential tones. From below the two glowing ends of their cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking down in the darkness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个冯·博克非同小可，堪称是德国皇帝麾下所有忠诚间谍之中最出色的人物。他的才干让他获得了最重要的一项谍报任务，也就是前来英国刺探情报，不但如此，在那些真正了解内情的人看来，自从他接受这项任务之后，他的才干更有了越来越突出的体现。世上只有六个人洞悉内情，其中之一就是他眼下的同伴、德国公使馆首席秘书冯·赫林男爵。此时此刻，男爵那辆形体巨大的一百马力奔驰轿车停在一旁，把那条乡间小路堵了个严严实实，正等着把它的主人送回伦敦。</td>
		<td class="en">A remarkable man this Von Bork—a man who could hardly be matched among all the devoted agents of the Kaiser. It was his talents which had first recommended him for the English mission, the most important mission of all, but since he had taken it over those talents had become more and more manifest to the half-dozen people in the world who were really in touch with the truth. One of these was his present companion, Baron Von Herling, the chief secretary of the legation, whose huge 100-horse-power Benz car was blocking the country lane as it waited to waft its owner back to London.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“根据我对形势的判断，十之八九，你本周就得回柏林去，”秘书说道，“回去之后，亲爱的冯·博克，我看你一定会为他们给你准备的礼遇感到惊奇。最高当局对你在英国的工作有些什么评价，我也是略有所闻的。”秘书是个大块头，又高又壮，主要的政治资本则是他那种慢条斯理、一本正经的说话方式。</td>
		<td class="en">“So far as I can judge the trend of events, you will probably be back in Berlin within the week,” the secretary was saying. “When you get there, my dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the welcome you will receive. I happen to know what is thought in the highest quarters of your work in this country.” He was a huge man, the secretary, deep, broad, and tall, with a slow, heavy fashion of speech which had been his main asset in his political career.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冯·博克笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Von Bork laughed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要骗他们并不难，”他如是说道，“比他们还要驯良单纯的民族，你连想都想不出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“They are not very hard to deceive,” he remarked. “A more docile, simple folk could not be imagined.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我倒不这么觉得，”对方若有所思地说道，“他们有一些古怪的规矩，你必须得学会遵守。外乡人往往会着他们的道，就是因为他们这种表面上的单纯。乍一看，你会觉得他们温和之极。接下来，你却会突然撞上某种十分坚硬的东西，这时你才会恍然大悟，你已经触到了他们的底线，只能设法适应头破血流的现实。举例说吧，他们有一些坐井观天的岛民习俗，不遵守是绝对不行的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t know about that,” said the other thoughtfully. “They have strange limits and one must learn to observe them. It is that surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger. One’s first impression is that they are entirely soft. Then one comes suddenly upon something very hard, and you know that you have reached the limit and must adapt yourself to the fact. They have, for example, their insular conventions which simply *must* be observed.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您指的是‘举止得体’之类的东西吗？”冯·博克叹了一口气，似乎是在这些方面吃过不少苦头。</td>
		<td class="en">“Meaning, ‘good form’ and that sort of thing?” Von Bork sighed as one who had suffered much.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我指的是所有那些千奇百怪的英国式偏见。为了说明这一点，我打算拿我自己栽的一个大跟头来做例子——我并不害怕谈论自己栽的跟头，因为你非常了解我的工作，看得到我的成就。事情发生在我刚来英国的时候，一位内阁大臣请我去他的乡间别墅参加周末聚会，聚会期间的谈话随意得叫人吃惊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations. As an example I may quote one of my own worst blunders—I can afford to talk of my blunders, for you know my work well enough to be aware of my successes. It was on my first arrival. I was invited to a week-end gathering at the country house of a cabinet minister. The conversation was amazingly indiscreet.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冯·博克点了点头。“我也去过那里，”他干巴巴地说了一句。</td>
		<td class="en">Von Bork nodded. “I’ve been there,” said he dryly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错。呃，聚会结束之后，我自然就把席间搜集到的情报整理成一份摘要，发给了柏林方面。不巧的是，我们那位可敬的总理在这些事情上有点儿毛手毛脚，不小心说漏了嘴，表明他知道聚会期间的谈话内容。当然喽，他的话直接把火引到了我的身上。你根本想象不到，那件事情对我造成了多么大的伤害。我可以跟你打包票，那一次，我们那些英国主人的态度一点儿都不温和。我花了两年的时间才摆脱那件事情的影响。你倒好，端着你这副运动员的姿态——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Exactly. Well, I naturally sent a résumé of the information to Berlin. Unfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these matters, and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was aware of what had been said. This, of course, took the trail straight up to me. You’ve no idea the harm that it did me. There was nothing soft about our British hosts on that occasion, I can assure you. I was two years living it down. Now you, with this sporting pose of yours—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，不对，您不能把这叫做‘姿态’。姿态是装出来的，我这可是天性的流露。我生来就擅长运动，而且乐在其中。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, no, don’t call it a pose. A pose is an artificial thing. This is quite natural. i am a born sportsman. i enjoy it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，这样一来，效果就更好啦。你跟他们赛艇，跟他们一起打猎、打马球，哪一项运动都不落在他们后面，你的四驾马车也在奥林匹亚[^2]夺得了大奖。我甚至听人说过，你居然跟那些年青的军官打起了拳击赛。结果呢？谁也不把你当回事，都觉得你是个‘运动行家’、‘德国人当中的君子’，还是个酗酒成性、夜夜笙歌、满城乱窜、没心没肺的小伙子。与此同时，你这座宁静的乡间别墅一直是英格兰半数破坏活动的中心，而你这个爱好运动的乡绅也一直是全欧洲最精明的秘密特工。天才啊，亲爱的冯·博克——真是天才！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, that makes it the more effective. You yacht against them, you hunt with them, you play polo, you match them in every game, your four-in-hand takes the prize at olympia. i have even heard that you go the length of boxing with the young officers. What is the result? nobody takes you seriously. You are a ‘good old sport,’ ‘quite a decent fellow for a German,’ a hard-drinking, night-club, knock-about-town, devil-may-care young fellow. And all the time this quiet country house of yours is the centre of half the mischief in England, and the sporting squire the most astute secret-service man in Europe. Genius, my dear Von Bork—genius!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您过奖了，男爵。不过，我确实可以说一句，我在英国的四年并不是一事无成。我还没领您参观过我那个小小的仓库呢，您愿意进屋待会儿吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You flatter me, Baron. But certainly i may claim that my four years in this country have not been unproductive. i’ve never shown you my little store. Would you mind stepping in for a moment?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >书房的门正对着露台。冯·博克推开房门，率先走进房间，“咔嗒”一声摁亮电灯，把身后的大块头秘书让了进去，然后就关上房门，把格子窗上的厚重帘帷拉得严严实实。他做好了所有这些预防措施，跟着又检查了一遍，这才把他那张鹰隼一般的黝黑脸庞转向了客人。</td>
		<td class="en">The door of the study opened straight on to the terrace. Von Bork pushed it back, and, leading the way, he clicked the switch of the electric light. He then closed the door behind the bulky form which followed him and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed window. only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did he turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的一部分文件已经不在这儿了，”他说道，“昨天，我妻子和家里的其他人一起去了弗卢辛[^3]，带走了不太重要的一些文件。当然喽，我必须要求使馆为剩下的这些文件提供保护。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Some of my papers have gone,” said he. “When my wife and the household left yesterday for Flushing they took the less important with them. I must, of course, claim the protection of the embassy for the others.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们已经把你列入了随员名单，你和你的行李都不会遇上什么麻烦。当然，赶巧了的话，咱们兴许也不是非走不可。英国没准儿会让法国自生自灭，因为我们确切地知道，英法两国并没有签订什么有约束力的条约。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite. There will be no difficulties for you or your baggage. of course, it is just possible that we may not have to go. England may leave France to her fate. We are sure that there is no binding treaty between them.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比利时也是这样吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And Belgium?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，比利时也是这样。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, and Belgium, too.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冯·博克摇了摇头。“我觉得这怎么也不可能。有一个明明白白的条约摆在那里，英国要是在这样的羞辱面前忍气吞声，那就永远也抬不起头啦[^4]。”</td>
		<td class="en">Von Bork shook his head. “I don’t see how that could be. There is a definite treaty there. She could never from such a humiliation.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她至少可以得到暂时的太平啊。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“She would at least have peace for the moment.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是，她的荣誉该怎么办呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But her honour?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“得了吧，亲爱的先生，咱们生活在一个功利主义的时代，‘荣誉’却是个中世纪的字眼儿。除此之外，英国并没有做好打仗的准备。说起来都让人不敢相信，咱们收了五千万的战争特别税，谁都会觉得咱们的意图已经昭然若揭，就跟在《泰晤士报》的头版登了广告一样，即便如此，这里的人依然沉睡不醒。时不时地会有人提出问题，我的责任就是给他们一个满意的答复；时不时地还有人感到愤慨，我的责任就是平息他们的怨气。不过，我可以跟你打包票，就那些关键环节而言，什么军需储备啦、防御潜艇攻击的措施啦、制造烈性炸药的计划啦，英国什么准备也没有。既然如此，英国怎么可能参战呢，更何况，咱们还把她的内部搅成了一锅粥，弄出了爱尔兰内战、砸窗子的泼妇[^5]，还有天晓得的其他一些让她自顾不暇的事情。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age. Honour is a medieval conception. Besides England is not ready. it is an inconceivable thing, but even our special war tax of fifty million, which one would think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of the *Times*, has not roused these people from their slumbers. Here and there one hears a question. it is my business to find an answer. Here and there also there is an irritation. it is my business to soothe it. But i can assure you that so far as the essentials go—the storage of munitions, the preparation for submarine attack, the arrangements for making high explosives—nothing is prepared. How, then, can England come in, especially when we have stirred her up such a devil’s brew of irish civil war, window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to keep her thoughts at home.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她总得为自己的将来着想吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“She must think of her future.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，那就是另一码事了。要我说，关于英国的将来，咱们已经有了非常明确的计划，还有啊，你提供的情报将会在其中发挥至关重要的作用。今天或者明天，早晚会轮到约翰·布尔先生[^6]的。如果他愿意今天打，咱们已经做好了充分的准备。如果他选择明天，咱们的准备还会更加充分。我倒是觉得，他们的上策是跟盟友并肩作战，不要等到必须独力支撑的时候，不过呢，这是他们自个儿的事情，用不着咱们操心。这个星期就是他们的转折关头。对了，刚才你不是在说你的那些文件嘛。”秘书窝在扶手椅上，悠然自得地吞云吐雾，光溜溜的大脑袋在灯光下闪闪发亮。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah, that is another matter. i fancy that in the future we have our own very definite plans about England, and that your information will be very vital to us. it is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John Bull. if he prefers to-day we are perfectly ready. if it is to-morrow we shall be more ready still. i should think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them, but that is their own affair. This week is their week of destiny. But you were speaking of your papers.” He sat in the armchair with the light shining upon his broad bald head, while he puffed sedately at his cigar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个宽敞的房间镶着橡木墙板，四壁都是书架，远端的角落里挂着一道帘子。拉开帘子之后，一个包有黄铜的大保险柜露了出来。冯·博克从自己的表链上取下一把小小的钥匙，在保险柜的锁上折腾了好一番工夫，跟着就一把拉开了厚重的柜门。</td>
		<td class="en">The large oak-panelled, book-lined room had a curtain hung in the further corner. When this was drawn it disclosed a large, brass-bound safe. Von Bork detached a small key from his watch chain, and after some considerable manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“瞧！”他喊了一声，站到一旁，冲秘书挥了挥手。</td>
		<td class="en">“look!” said he, standing clear, with a wave of his hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >灯光把保险柜的内部照得清清楚楚，使馆秘书全神贯注地凝视着柜子里的一排排满满当当的文件格子。每个格子都贴着标签，一眼望去，他看到了一长串诸如“浅滩”、“港口防御”、“飞机”、“爱尔兰”、“埃及”、“朴茨茅斯要塞”、“英吉利海峡”、“罗赛斯”[^7]之类的名称，此外还有几十个别的。所有的格子都塞满了文件和图纸。</td>
		<td class="en">The light shone vividly into the opened safe, and the secretary of the embassy gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed pigeon-holes with which it was furnished. Each pigeon-hole had its label, and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such titles as “Fords,” “Harbour-defences,” “Aeroplanes,” “ireland,” “Egypt,” “Portsmouth forts,” “The Channel,” “Rosythe,” and a score of others. Each compartment was bristling with papers and plans.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“了不起！”秘书说道，跟着就放下雪茄，用他那双肥硕的手轻轻地鼓起掌来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Colossal!” said the secretary. Putting down his cigar he softly clapped his fat hands.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“所有这些都是在四年的时间里收集来的，男爵。对于一名狂饮无度、成天跑马的乡绅来说，这也算不赖了吧。不过，我最精美的那件藏品还在路上呢，这不，位置我都给它留好啦。”说的这里，他指了指标着“海军密码”的那个格子。</td>
		<td class="en">“And all in four years, Baron. not such a bad show for the hard-drinking, hard-riding country squire. But the gem of my collection is coming and there is the setting all ready for it.” He pointed to a space over which “naval Signals” was printed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是，你那个格子里的档案已经很丰富了啊。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“But you have a good dossier there already.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“全都是些过时的废纸。英国的海军部莫名其妙地产生了警觉，把所有的密码都给换了。这可是一次沉重的打击，男爵，是我整场战役当中最惨的一个败仗。不过，多亏了我的支票簿，还有能干的阿尔塔芒，所有问题都可以在今天晚上得到补救。”</td>
		<td class="en">“out of date and waste paper. The Admiralty in some way got the alarm and every code has been changed. it was a blow, Baron—the worst setback in my whole campaign. But thanks to my check-book and the good Altamont all will be well to-night.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男爵看了看表，从喉咙里发出了一声失望的惊呼。</td>
		<td class="en">The Baron looked at his watch and gave a guttural exclamation of disappointment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，我真的不能再等啦。你应该明白，此时此刻，卡尔顿巷[^8]那边事情很多，我们都得各就各位。我本来还打算把你取得巨大成功的消息带回去呢。阿尔塔芒没说什么时候来吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, i really can wait no longer. You can imagine that things are moving at present in Carlton Terrace and that we have all to be at our posts. i had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup. Did Altamont name no hour?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冯·博克把一封电报推到了男爵面前。</td>
		<td class="en">Von Bork pushed over a telegram.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 今晚必携新火花塞前来。</td>
		<td class="en">> Will come without fail to-night and bring new sparking plugs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> 阿尔塔芒</td>
		<td class="en">> ALTAMONT.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“火花塞，嗯？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sparking plugs, eh?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您知道吗，他假扮成了一名汽车专家，而我的车库里停满了汽车。按照我俩约定的暗号，有可能到手的所有资料都用汽车配件来命名。如果他说‘水箱’，指的就是战列舰，‘油泵’则是巡洋舰，如此等等。‘火花塞’就是海军密码。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You see he poses as a motor expert and i keep a full garage. in our code everything likely to come up is named after some spare part. if he talks of a radiator it is a battleship, of an oil pump a cruiser, and so on. Sparking plugs are naval signals.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“电报是今天中午从朴茨茅斯发来的，”秘书一边察看电报的抬头，一边说道，“对了，你给他的报酬是什么呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“From Portsmouth at midday,” said the secretary, examining the superscription. “By the way, what do you give him?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这件活计的报酬是五百镑。当然喽，他还有日常的薪水。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Five hundred pounds for this particular job. Of course he has a salary as well.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真是个贪心不足的无赖。他们这样的叛徒确实有用，可我还是不甘心让他们挣这种脏钱。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The greedy rogue. They are useful, these traitors, but I grudge them their blood money.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果是阿尔塔芒，给多少我都甘心。他是个非常出色的特工。用他自个儿的话来说，我给他的价钱固然高，终归也从他那里拿到了东西。还有啊，他并不是什么叛徒。我敢跟您打包票，说到对英国的态度，跟那些满心仇怨的爱尔兰裔美国人比起来，咱们那些最激烈的大日耳曼主义容克[^9]也不过是温顺的乳鸽而已。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I grudge Altamont nothing. He is a wonderful worker. if i pay him well, at least he delivers the goods, to use his own phrase. Besides he is not a traitor. i assure you that our most pan-Germanic Junker is a sucking dove in his feelings towards England as compared with a real bitter irish-American.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，他是个爱尔兰裔美国人吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, an irish-American?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听听他的口音，您就不会再有什么疑问。说实在的，有时候我简直听不懂他在说什么。看样子，他不光是跟英国的国王过不去，还跟国王陛下的英语[^10]过不去。您一定要走吗？他随时都会到这里来的。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“If you heard him talk you would not doubt it. Sometimes i assure you I can hardly understand him. He seems to have declared war on the King’s English as well as on the English king. Must you really go? He may be here any moment.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不行。很抱歉，可我已经耽搁得太久啦。明天你早点儿来吧，一旦你把密码本带进约克公爵台阶旁边的那道小门[^11]，就算是为你在英国的工作画上了一个圆满的句号。什么！你还准备了托考依葡萄酒[^12]！”他指了指立在托盘里的一个积满尘土的酒瓶，瓶子封得严严实实，旁边还放着两只高脚酒杯。</td>
		<td class="en">“No. I’m sorry, but i have already overstayed my time. We shall expect you early to-morrow, and when you get that signal book through the little door on the Duke of York’s steps you can put a triumphant finis to your record in England. What! Tokay!” he indicated a heavily sealed dust-covered bottle which stood with two high glasses upon a salver.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您愿意喝一杯再走吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“May i offer you a glass before your journey?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不了，谢谢。看样子，你们两个还打算痛饮一顿哩。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, thanks. But it looks like revelry.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“阿尔塔芒喝酒的口味很刁，而且看上了我的托考依葡萄酒。他这个家伙非常敏感，你必须在小事情上面将就他一下。说真的，研究他可是我的必修课哩。”说话间，他俩已经再次走上露台，正在顺着露台往外走。等在露台远端的司机轻轻一碰，男爵那辆庞大的轿车立刻震颤起来，发出了隆隆的轰鸣声。“依我看，那一定是哈里奇[^13]的灯火，”秘书一边说，一边穿上了风衣。“一切都是多么的平静、多么的安宁啊。本周之内，那里兴许就会有一些其他的火光，英国的海岸也不会再像现在这么宁静啦！如果那个能干的齐柏林[^14]答应我们的事情都能实现的话，英国的天空多半也保不住眼下的太平。对了，那个人是谁？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Altamont has a nice taste in wines, and he took a fancy to my Tokay. He is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things. i have to study him, i assure you.” They had strolled out on to the terrace again, and along it to the further end where at a touch from the Baron’s chauffeur the great car shivered and chuckled. “Those are the lights of Harwich, I suppose,” said the secretary, pulling on his dust coat. “How still and peaceful it all seems. There may be other lights within the week, and the English coast a less tranquil place! The heavens, too, may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good Zeppelin promises us comes true. By the way, who is that?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他俩的身后只有一扇窗子还透着亮光，窗子里面点着一盏油灯，油灯侧畔的桌子旁边坐着一位可亲可敬、面色红润的老太太，戴着一顶乡村便帽。她正在埋头编织东西，还时不时地停下活计，伸手去抚摸身边小凳上的一只大黑猫。</td>
		<td class="en">Only one window showed a light behind them; in it there stood a lamp, and beside it, seated at a table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a country cap. She was bending over her knitting and stopping occasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是玛莎，我就留了这么一个仆人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That is Martha, the only servant i have left.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >秘书吃吃地笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">The secretary chuckled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她简直就是不列颠妮亚[^15]的化身哩，”他说道，“满脑子都是自个儿的事情，悠闲自在、昏昏欲睡。好了，再见，冯·博克！”他挥手作别，钻进轿车，转眼之间，轿车头灯射出的两束金光已经穿透了前方的黑暗。秘书仰在豪华座驾的靠垫上，全神贯注地思考着即将到来的欧洲战祸，因此就没有留意到，自己的轿车顺着村中街道曲折行进的时候，差一点儿就撞上了迎面驶来的一辆小小的福特轿车。</td>
		<td class="en">“She might almost personify Britannia,” said he, “with her complete self-absorption and general air of comfortable somnolence. Well, *au revoir*, Von Bork!” With a final wave of his hand he sprang into the car, and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot forward through the darkness. The secretary lay back in the cushions of the luxurious limousine, with his thoughts so full of the impending European tragedy that he hardly observed that as his car swung round the village street it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in the opposite direction.</td></tr>

As he passed he observed that his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired. it was a new experience to him, the silence and darkness of his widespread house for his family and household had been a large one. it was a relief to him, however, to think that they were all in safety and that, but for that one old woman who had lingered in the kitchen, he had the whole place to himself. There was a good deal of tidying up to do inside his study and he set himself to do it until his keen, handsome face was flushed with the heat of the burning papers. A leather valise stood beside his table, and into this he began to pack very neatly and systematically the precious contents of his safe. He had hardly got started with the work, however, when his quick ears caught the sound of a distant car. instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe, locked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. He was just in time to see the lights of a small car come to a halt at the gate. A passenger sprang out of it and advanced swiftly towards him, while the chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly man with a gray moustache, settled down like one who resigns himself to a long vigil.</td></tr>

The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things were going wrong, and no one could understand why they were going wrong. Agents were suspected or even caught, but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force. it was absolutely necessary to expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter. It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of excitement. When I say that i started my pilgrimage at Chicago, graduated in an irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realise that the matter was complex. Since then i have been honoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison.
