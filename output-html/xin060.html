		<td class="en">夜晚，当我踱步穿过这片孤寂的地方时，总能在风拂过野蓟草和小糠草的摩挲声中，听见昔日的喇叭声、军号声，还有给马匹套上缰绳的声音；眼前也不由得浮现出幻影一般成排的军营帐篷和军队辎重。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >From within the canvases come guttural syllables of foreign tongues, and broken songs of the fatherland; for they were mainly regiments of the King’s German Legion that slept round the tent-poles hereabout at that time.</td>

		<td class="en">与世隔绝的古老庄园和村庄，坐落在山间峡谷中，自从国王选择每年到此地以南几英里的海滨浴场沐浴后，这里就很少有外人出入了。因此，这些军队的到来犹如从天而降，落脚在这片空旷的荒野上。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The oblivion which in her modesty and humility she courted for herself has only partially fallen on her, with the unfortunate result of inflicting an injustice upon her memory; since such fragments of her story as got abroad at the time, and have been kept alive ever since, are precisely those which are most unfavourable to her character.</td>
		<td class="en">她谦卑地渴望着自己被人们忘记，却没有被完全遗忘，这样不幸的结果对于她的回忆来说不太公平。因为关于她的故事的只言片语那时已经传到了海外，并且自那以后就一直广为流传，而这些正是她最不想看到的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It all began with the arrival of the York Hussars, one of the foreign regiments above alluded to.</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Before that day scarcely a soul had been seen near her father’s house for weeks.</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When a noise like the brushing skirt of a visitor was heard on the doorstep, it proved to be a scudding leaf; when a carriage seemed to be nearing the door, it was her father grinding his sickle on the stone in the garden for his favourite relaxation of trimming the box-tree borders to the plots.</td>
		<td class="en">有时门阶上似乎传来了来访者衣摆摩擦的声响，结果却是一片随风飘落的树叶；有时门前似乎传来了马车的辘辘声，结果却是她父亲在花园里磨镰刀的霍霍声；用磨好的镰刀来修建黄杨树的边角，将它们切成一块一块的，这是她父亲最喜欢的休闲活动。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >A sound like luggage thrown down from the coach was a gun far away at sea; and what looked like a tall man by the gate at dusk was a yew bush cut into a quaint and attenuated shape.</td>
		<td class="en">那仿佛是行李从马车上卸下来的声音，只不过是远处海面上的枪响；那暮色中看似出现在门边的高个人影，只不过是紫杉树枝杈被剪成了古雅消瘦的模样。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There is no such solitude in country places now as there was in those old days.</td>
		<td class="en">在如今的乡村里，再也找不到昔日那样幽静的地方了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Yet all the while King George and his court were at his favourite sea-side resort, not more than five miles off.</td>
		<td class="en">然而，乔治国王和他的随从一直停留在那个他最喜欢的海边行宫，那地方离这里不过五英里。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The daughter’s seclusion was great, but beyond the seclusion of the girl lay the seclusion of the father.</td>
		<td class="en">女儿平时深居简出，但是比起深闺中的女儿，父亲的隐居生活更加封闭。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >If her social condition was twilight, his was darkness.</td>
		<td class="en">倘若将女儿的社交生活比作暮光般暗淡，那么父亲的社交生活就好比是夜晚般黑暗了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Yet he enjoyed his darkness, while her twilight oppressed her.</td>
		<td class="en">不过他倒是很享受这样的暗夜般的生活，而他女儿却为自己的灰暗的日子而感到压抑。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Dr. Grove had been a professional man whose taste for lonely meditation over metaphysical questions had diminished his practice till it no longer paid him to keep it going; after which he had relinquished it and hired at a nominal rent the small, dilapidated, half farm half manor-house of this obscure inland nook, to make a sufficiency of an income which in a town would have been inadequate for their maintenance.</td>
		<td class="en">格罗夫医生曾经是个职业医生，但是他迷上了一度独自思考玄学问题，这使他的出诊次数大幅减少，最后他终于不能靠这份职业维持生计。于是他便放弃了这份工作，名义上交付了一笔租金，在内地这个偏僻的角落寻得一个又小又旧的、半是别墅半是农场的住处，这样一来，他便有了足够的收入来源，倘若在城镇里，这点儿收入还不足以维持基本生活呢。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He stayed in his garden the greater part of the day, growing more and more irritable with the lapse of time, and the increasing perception that he had wasted his life in the pursuit of illusions.</td>
		<td class="en">一天中的大部分时间，他都呆在花园里，随着时光的流逝，他变得越来越焦躁；频频出现的因追求幻想而虚度人生的想法也让他十分烦躁。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >He saw his friends less and less frequently.</td>
		<td class="en">他去拜访朋友的次数越来越少了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Phyllis became so shy that if she met a stranger anywhere in her short rambles she felt ashamed at his gaze, walked awkwardly, and blushed to her shoulders.</td>
		<td class="en">菲利斯变得非常害羞，倘若她在短暂的外出时遇到了生人，别人的凝视都会让她害臊，走路的姿势就会变得别扭起来，整个脸都羞红了，一直红到肩膀。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Yet Phyllis was discovered even here by an admirer, and her hand most unexpectedly asked in marriage.</td>
		<td class="en">不过就算如此，菲利斯也有了一位仰慕者，并且出乎意料地向她求了婚。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The King, as aforesaid, was at the neighbouring town, where he had taken up his abode at Gloucester Lodge and his presence in the town naturally brought many county people thither.</td>
		<td class="en">正如上文所说，国王就在附近的镇上，下榻在格洛斯特旅馆，他在镇上的出现自然引来了很多郡上百姓前来看热闹。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Among these idlers—many of whom professed to have connections and interests with the Court—was one Humphrey Gould, a bachelor; a personage neither young nor old; neither good-looking nor positively plain.</td>
		<td class="en">在这些游手好闲的人中，很多人都声称自己与宫廷有关系，对皇家轶事很有兴趣，其中就有汉弗莱·古尔德。他是一个单身汉，年龄不算年轻但也不老，相貌不算英俊却绝非平庸。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Too steady-going to be ‘a buck’ (as fast and unmarried men were then called), he was an approximately fashionable man of a mild type.</td>
		<td class="en">他行事稳重，没法给他扣上“花花公子”的帽子（当时很多单身汉都被这样称呼），他算是一个性情温和、比较时髦的人 。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This bachelor of thirty found his way to the village on the down: beheld Phyllis; made her father’s acquaintance in order to make hers; and by some means or other she sufficiently inflamed his heart to lead him in that direction almost daily; till he became engaged to marry her.</td>
		<td class="en">这位时年30岁的单身汉，在去丘陵上的村子走的路上邂逅了菲利斯，为了能认识她，他去结识了她的父亲。她以某种方式燃起他心中的火焰，他几乎每天都登门拜访，直到最终与她订婚。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >As he was of an old local family, some of whose members were held in respect in the county, Phyllis, in bringing him to her feet, had accomplished what was considered a brilliant move for one in her constrained position.</td>
		<td class="en">由于他来自当地一个古老的家庭，一些家族成员在郡上颇具声望，菲利斯能让他拜倒在自己的裙下，这对于像她这样身处受约束地位的人来说，可谓是个明智之举。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >How she had done it was not quite known to Phyllis herself.</td>
		<td class="en">至于菲利斯如何做到这一点的，连她自己都不知道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >In those days unequal marriages were regarded rather as a violation of the laws of nature than as a mere infringement of convention, the more modern view, and hence when Phyllis, of the watering-place bourgeoisie, was chosen by such a gentlemanly fellow, it was as if she were going to be taken to heaven, though perhaps the uninformed would have seen no great difference in the respective positions of the pair, the said Gould being as poor as a crow.</td>
		<td class="en">在那个时代，门不当户不对的婚姻被看成是违背了自然法则，而不是更现代一点儿的看法所认为的那样，仅仅是违反了社会风俗。因此，当来自海滨中产阶级的菲利斯被一位绅士选为妻子时，就好比是她被带到了天堂，而也许只有不知情的人才会发现，其实这一对夫妻在各自的地位上并无太大差异，据说是因为古尔德一贫如洗。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This pecuniary condition was his excuse—probably a true one—for postponing their union, and as the winter drew nearer, and the King departed for the season, Mr. Humphrey Gould set out for Bath, promising to return to Phyllis in a few weeks.</td>
		<td class="en">窘迫的财务状况是他推迟结婚仪式的理由，这个理由多半不是假话。随着冬天的临近，国王为了避寒离开了这个地方，汉弗莱·古尔德先生则动身前往巴斯，并保证几周以后就回到菲利斯身边。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The winter arrived, the date of his promise passed, yet Gould postponed his coming, on the ground that he could not very easily leave his father in the city of their sojourn, the elder having no other relative near him.</td>
		<td class="en">冬天来了，古尔德许诺过的归期已经过去了，而他却推迟了自己回来的日子，并解释说他无法把自己的父亲一个人留在他们旅居的城市里，因为老人身边没有别的亲戚了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Phyllis, though lonely in the extreme, was content.</td>
		<td class="en">菲利斯虽然一个人十分孤单，但心里还是满足的。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The man who had asked her in marriage was a desirable husband for her in many ways; her father highly approved of his suit; but this neglect of her was awkward, if not painful, for Phyllis.</td>
		<td class="en">向她求婚的这个人，在很多方面对她来说，都是一位理想的丈夫。她父亲就十分赞成他的求婚。但是父亲对自己的这种冷淡态度给她带来的就算不是痛苦，也是一种尴尬的感觉。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Love him in the true sense of the word she assured me she never did, but she had a genuine regard for him; admired a certain methodical and dogged way in which he sometimes took his pleasure; valued his knowledge of what the Court was doing, had done, or was about to do; and she was not without a feeling of pride that he had chosen her when he might have exercised a more ambitious choice.</td>
		<td class="en">她告诉我，她从来没有真正爱过他，但她对他所怀的尊敬之情是千真万确的。她仰慕他，以某种颇有条理却又固执的方式，让他十分受用；她看重他对皇家事务的见解，他知道宫廷里正在发生的事、已经发生的事和即将发生的事；她对于他选自己为妻深感骄傲，因为他本可以有更好的选择。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But he did not come; and the spring developed.</td>
		<td class="en">但是他还是没有回来，而春天已经到来了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >His letters were regular though formal; and it is not to be wondered that the uncertainty of her position, linked with the fact that there was not much passion in her thoughts of Humphrey, bred an indescribable dreariness in the heart of Phyllis Grove.</td>
		<td class="en">他的来信很频繁，但是措词很正式。她所处的地位变得不那么确定了，而她想起汉弗莱的时候心中也没有多少热情了，难怪菲利斯·格罗夫心中会滋生一种莫名的凄凉。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The spring was soon summer, and the summer brought the King; but still no Humphrey Gould.</td>
		<td class="en">春天很快就变成了夏天，国王在夏天又回到了这里，但是汉弗莱·古尔德依旧没有回来。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >All this while the engagement by letter was maintained intact.</td>
		<td class="en">在这期间，一纸婚约就靠来信维系着。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At this point of time a golden radiance flashed in upon the lives of people here, and charged all youthful thought with emotional interest.</td>
		<td class="en">就在此时，一道金色的光芒照射了这里人们的生活，给所有年轻的头脑带来了热情洋溢的乐趣。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They were one of the regiments of the King’s German Legion, and (though they somewhat degenerated later on) their brilliant uniform, their splendid horses, and above all, their foreign air and mustachios (rare appendages then), drew crowds of admirers of both sexes wherever they went.</td>
		<td class="en">他们隶属于皇家德意志兵团，虽然后来这支军队有所没落，但在当时，他们漂亮的制服和俊美的马匹，更重要的是，他们浑身上下散发出的异域气息和别致的髭须（当时这样的装饰并不常见），让他们无论走到哪里，都有一大群男女仰慕者。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">自孩提时代起，菲利斯就很喜欢爬到围墙顶上，坐在那里——这举动看似困难，实则很轻巧，因为这一带的围墙都是由碎石砌成的，没有使用灰泥来涂抹，所以墙中有很多细缝，可以为纤小的脚趾提供落脚之处。</td></tr>
