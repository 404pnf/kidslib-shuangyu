		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从霍顿斯湾镇到湖边的石子路的路上有一泓清泉。泉水从路边的瓦沟里冒出来，漫过瓦沟破裂的边缘，穿过茂密的薄荷丛，流到沼泽地里。黑暗中，尼克把胳膊伸进泉水中，但是水太冷了，胳膊在里面根本呆不住。沙子从水底的泉眼里喷射出来，打在手指上，他感到像羽毛拂过一样。尼克想，要是全身都浸在里面多好啊。我敢肯定很惬意。他把胳膊缩回来，坐在路边。真是个炎热的夜晚。穿过树林，到了路的那头，他能看见比恩家白色的房子，房子建在水上，有脚桩支撑着。他不想到码头去。大家都在那里游泳。他不想看见奥德加跟在凯特身边。他能看见仓库旁边的路上停着那辆汽车。奥德加和凯特就在那里。每次奥德加看凯特的时候,眼神就像煎鱼一样。奥德加难道什么都不知道吗？凯特是永远不会嫁给他的。她是决不会嫁给一个不能赢得她欢心的人的。如果这样的人硬是要赢得她的欢心的话，她心里会觉得恶心，会变得冷漠，会溜掉。他倒是能让她这么做。她不仅不会觉得恶心，变得冷漠，只想溜掉，反而还会痛快地敞开胸怀，轻松自在，而且易于把握。奥德加以为这是爱情的作用。他的眼睛睁得大大的，眼睑边缘红红的。她怎么受得了，根本不让他碰她。这都写在他眼里了。奥德加还是希望他们像以前一样做朋友。在沙滩上玩耍。捏泥人。一起坐小船进行一日游。凯特总是穿着游泳衣。奥德加就一直盯着她看。</td>
		<td class="en">Halfway down the gravel road from Hortons Bay, the town, to the lake there was a spring.The water came up in a tile sunk beside the road, lipping over the cracked edge of the tile and flowing away through the close growing mint into the swamp.In the dark Nick put his arm down into the spring but could not hold it there because of the cold.He felt the featherings of the sand spouting up from the spring cones at the bottom against his fingers.Nick thought, I wish I could put all of myself in there.I bet that would fix me.He pulled his arm out and sat down at the edge of the road.It was a hot night.Down the road through the trees he could see the white of the Bean house on its piles over the water.He did not want to go down to the dock.Everybody was down there swimming.He did not want Kate with Odgar around.He could see the car on the road beside the warehouse.Odgar and Kate were down there.Odgar with that fried-fish look in his eye every time he looked at Kate.Didn’t Odgar know anything?Kate wouldn’t ever marry him.She wouldn’t ever marry anybody that didn’t make her.And if they tried to make her she would curl up inside of herself and be hard and slip away.He could make her do it all right.Instead of curling up hard and slipping away she would open out smoothly, relaxing, untightening, easy to hold.Odgar thought it was love that did it.His eyes got walleyed and red at the edges of the lids.She couldn’t bear to have him touch her.It was all in his eyes.Then Odgar would want them to be just the same friends as ever.Play in the sand.Make mud images.Take all-day trips in the boat together.Kate always in her bathing suit.Odgar looking at her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >奥德加有三十二岁了，因为精索静脉曲张做过两次手术。他长得丑，大家都爱拿他的脸当稀罕看。奥德加永远都得不到，可是这对他来说就是全部。每到夏天，他的境况就更遭。真是可怜。奥德加人太好了。没有人比他对尼克更好的了。而今，尼克只要想的话就能得到。奥德加会自杀的，尼克想，要是他知道的话。我倒是好奇他会怎么自杀呢。他无法把奥德加跟死亡联系在一起。他或许不想那么做。不过人们都是那么做的。不仅仅是爱情。奥德加以为只要有了爱情就可以了。奥德加够爱她的了，天知道。这事就是要动心，对身体动心，要熟悉身体，要说好话，要冒点险，千万别吓着对方，要体贴对方，直接占有不必先问，既要温柔又要动心，还要让对方动心，觉得幸福，开开玩笑，别让人家害怕。之后也就一切都顺利了。这不是只凭爱情的。爱情会把人吓着的。他，尼古拉斯·亚当斯，只要他想要就能得到，因为他身上有某种东西。也许这种东西并不持久。也许他会失去这种东西。他倒是想把这种东西给奥德加，或者就告诉他怎么做。可是人不能对任何人都无话不谈。特别是对奥德加。不，不只是对奥德加。不管对任何人，在任何地方。说话太多是他最容易犯的错。因为说话太多，他误了自己很多事。然而，还是应该为普林斯顿、耶鲁和哈佛这些大学的童男子们做点什么。为什么州立大学就没有童男子呢？或许是因为男女同校吧。他们遇上待嫁的姑娘，姑娘们一路帮他们的忙，然后嫁给他们。奥德加、哈维、迈克，还有其他这样的家伙会怎样呢？他不知道。他还年轻，阅历还不够。他们是这世上最好的人。他们会怎样？他怎么能知道呢。他刚懂事十年，又怎能写得像哈代和汉姆生一样呢。他可写不了。等他五十岁的时候吧。</td>
		<td class="en">Odgar was thirty-two and had been twice operated on for varicocele.He was ugly to look at and everybody liked his face.Odgar could never get it and it meant everything in the world to him.Every summer he was worse about it.It was pitiful.Odgar was awfully nice.He had been nicer to Nick than anybody ever had. Now Nick could get it if he wanted it.Odgar would kill himself, Nick thought, if he knew it.I wonder how he’d kill himself.He couldn’t think of Odgar dead.He probably wouldn’t do it.Still people did.It wasn’t just love.Odgar thought just love would do it.Odgar loved her enough, God knows.It was liking, and liking the body, and introducing the body, and persuading, and taking chances, and never frightening, and assuming about the other person, and always taking never asking, and gentleness and liking, and making liking and happiness, and joking and making people not afraid.And making it all right afterwards.It wasn’t loving.Loving was frightening.He, Nicholas Adams, could have what he wanted because of something in him.Maybe it did not last.Maybe he would lose it.He wished he could give it to Odgar, or tell Odgar about it.You couldn’t ever tell anybody about anything.Especially Odgar.No, not especially Odgar.Anybody, anywhere.That had always been his first mistake, talking.He had talked himself out of too many things.There ought to be something you could do for the Princeton, Yale and Harvard virgins, though.Why weren’t there any virgins in state universities?Co-education maybe.They met girls who were out to marry and the girls helped them along and married them.What would become of fellows like Odgar and Harvey and Mike and all the rest?He didn’t know.He hadn’t lived long enough.They were the best people in the world.What became of them?How the hell could he know.How could he write like Hardy and Hamsun when he only knew ten years of life.He couldn’t.Wait till he was fifty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >黑暗中他跪下来，喝了口泉水。他觉得很惬意。他知道自己会成为一位伟大的作家的。他懂得些事情，他们比不上他。没人能比得上他。只是他懂的事还不多。以后会多起来的。他知道的。水太冷了，激得他眼睛疼。他这一大口水喝得太猛了。像冰激凌一样。鼻子没在水里喝水就是这样子的。最好还是去游泳吧。瞎想没有用。一想就停不下来。他沿路而下，走过汽车和左边的大仓库，秋天的时候苹果和土豆就从这里装到船上，又走过比恩家刷成白色的房子，有时候大家就就着提灯的灯光在那里的硬木板上跳舞，一直走到码头，到了大家游泳的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">In the dark he kneeled down and took a drink from the spring.He felt all right.He knew he was going to be a great writer.He knew things and they couldn’t touch him.Nobody could.Only he did not know enough things.That would come all right.He knew.The water was cold and made his eyes ache.He had swallowed too big a gulp.Like ice cream.That’s the way with drinking with your nose underwater.He’d better go swimming.Thinking was no good.It started and went on so.He walked down the road, past the car and the big warehouse on the left where apples and potatoes were loaded onto the boats in the fall, past the white-painted Bean house where they danced by lantern light sometimes on the hard-wood floor, out on the dock to where they were swimming.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们都在码头的尽头处游泳。尼克沿着高高架在水面上的粗糙木板走去时，听见长长的跳板抗议似的响了两声，接着是水溅起的声音。水拍打着下面的木桩。一定是吉，他想。凯特像只海豹一样从水里钻出，攀着梯子上来了。</td>
		<td class="en">They were all swimming off the end of the dock.As Nick walked along the rough boards high above the water he heard the double protest of the long springboard and a splash.The water lapped below in the piles.That must be the Ghee, he thought.Kate came up out of the water like a seal and pulled herself up the ladder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是韦姆奇，”她对大伙喊道，“来吧，韦姆奇。感觉棒极了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s Wemedge,” she shouted to the others.“Come on in, Wemedge.It’s wonderful.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，韦姆奇，”奥德加说，“兄弟，好玩着呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hi, Wemedge,” said Odgar.“Boy it’s great.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“韦姆奇在哪里？”是吉，他已经游到远处了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Where’s Wemedge?”It was the Ghee, swimming far out.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是韦姆奇吗，不会游泳的家伙？”水面上传过比尔的声音，是低沉的男低音。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is this man Wemedge a nonswimmer?”Bill’s voice very deep and bass over the water.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尼克感觉很爽。大家这么冲你喊，可真有意思。他蹬掉了帆布鞋，把衬衣从头顶上拉掉，蹭掉了长裤。光着的双脚能感觉到码头的木板上还有沙子。他快步跑在柔韧的跳板上，脚趾在跳板末端一蹬，身子一紧，就平稳地潜进深水里了，根本没有意识到自己是在跳水。跳之前他深吸了口气，现在在水里他就一直往前游，拱着背，拖着伸得直直的脚。然后浮出水面，脸朝下在水上漂浮着。他翻过身来，睁开了眼。他对游泳不感兴趣，只喜欢跳水，潜在水下。</td>
		<td class="en">Nick felt good.It was fun to have people yell at you like that.He scuffed off his canvas shoes, pulled his shirt over his head and stepped out of his trousers.His bare feet felt the sandy planks of the dock.He ran very quickly out the yielding plank of the springboard, his toes shoved against the end of the board, he tightened and he was in the water, smoothly and deeply, with no consciousness of the dive.He had breathed in deeply as he took off and now went on and on through the water, holding his back arched, feet straight and trailing.Then he was on the surface, floating face down.He rolled over and opened his eyes.He did not care anything about swimming, only to dive and be underwater.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么样，韦姆奇？”吉就在他身后。</td>
		<td class="en">“How is it, Wemedge?”The Ghee was just behind him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“爽极了。”尼克说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Warm as piss,” Nick said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他深吸了口气，双手抱住脚踝，双膝弯在下巴下面，缓缓地沉入水中。水的上层很暖和，但是一路沉下去，很快就变凉了，接着就变冷了。接近水底的时候水特别冷。尼克轻轻漂到了水底。他伸展身体，使劲一蹬水底，想上去换换气，可水底都是泥灰，脚趾碰上那东西的时候感觉很难受。从水下来到黑暗的夜色中，感觉很陌生。尼克呆在水里，时不时地拍拍水，感觉很惬意。奥德加和凯特正在码头上说话呢。</td>
		<td class="en">He took a deep breath, took hold of his ankles with his hands, his knees under his chin, and sank slowly down into the water.It was warm at the top but he dropped quickly into cool, then cold.As he neared the bottom it was quite cold.Nick floated down gently against the bottom.It was marly and his toes hated it as he uncurled and shoved hard against it to come up to the air.It was strange coming up from underwater into the dark.Nick rested in the water, barely paddling and comfortable.Odgar and Kate were talking together up on the dock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在会发磷光的海里游过泳吗，卡尔？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Have you ever swum in a sea where it was phosphorescent, Carl?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有。”奥德加一跟凯特说话，声音就不自然。</td>
		<td class="en">“No.”Odgar’s voice was unnatural talking to Kate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那我们身上不都可以划火柴了吗，尼克心想。他深吸一口气，屈起双膝，紧紧抱住身体，沉了下去，这次是睁着眼的。他轻轻地下沉，先是侧着身子，接着便头冲下沉下去了。可是这样也不好。黑暗中他在水下什么也看不见。第一次跳的时候闭着眼睛是对的。像这样的反应真是有趣。然而也不是每次都对。他没有一路沉下去，而是舒展了身体往前游去，游过了上面的凉水层，停在了紧挨暖水层的下面。在水下潜泳多有意思，像通常那样游泳就有多没意思，可真是有趣。在海面上游泳倒是有趣。是因为海水的浮力。可是海水里有盐味，叫人越游越渴。在淡水里游就好多了。就像这样，晚上天热的时候。他上来换气，正好在码头边上突起的部分底下，便爬上了梯子。</td>
		<td class="en">We might rub ourselves all over with matches, Nick thought.He took a deep breath, drew his knees up, clasped tight and sank, this time with his eyes open.He sank gently, first going off to one side, then sinking head first.It was no good.He could not see underwater in the dark.He was right to keep his eyes shut when he first dove in.It was funny about reactions like that.They weren’t always right, though.He did not go all the way down but straightened out and swam along and up through the cool, keeping just below the warm surface water.It was funny how much fun it was to swim underwater and how little fun there was in plain swimming.It was fun to swim on the surface in the ocean.That was the buoyancy.But there was the taste of the brine and the way it made you thirsty.Fresh water was better.Just like this on a hot night.He came up for air just under the projecting edge of the dock and climbed up the ladder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，跳一个吧，韦姆奇，好不好？”凯特说，“跳一个漂亮的。”他们正一起坐在码头上，背靠着其中一个大木桩。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, dive, Wemedge, will you?” Kate said.“Do a good dive.”They were sitting together on the dock leaning back against one of the big piles.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“跳一个不带声音的，韦姆奇。”奥德加说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Do a noiseless one, Wemedge,” Odgar said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“All right.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尼克湿淋淋地走上跳板，想着该怎么跳。奥德加和凯特看着他，夜色中一个黑影，站在跳板末端，保持好平衡一跃而下，这是他看海獭跳水学来的。尼克在水里转身想上去换口气的时候，心想，哎，要是凯特能下来和我一起多好啊。他猛地冲出水面，眼睛里和耳朵里都进水了。他一定是提早吸气了。</td>
		<td class="en">Nick, dripping, walked out on the springboard, remembering how to do the dive.Odgar and Kate watched him, black in the dark, standing at the end of the board, poise and dive as he had learned from watching a sea otter.In the water as he turned to come up to the air Nick thought, Gosh, if I could only have Kate down here.He came up in a rush to the surface, feeling water in his eyes and ears.He must have started to take a breath.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太完美了。完美极了。”凯特在码头上喊。</td>
		<td class="en">“It was perfect.Absolutely perfect,” Kate shouted from the dock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尼克从梯子上爬上来。</td>
		<td class="en">Nick came up the ladder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们人呢？”他问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Where are the men?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们远远地游到湾里去了。”奥德加说。</td>
		<td class="en">“They’re swimming way out in the bay,” Odgar said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尼克在码头上躺下，挨着凯特和奥德加。他能听见吉和比尔在远处的黑暗中游着。</td>
		<td class="en">Nick lay down on the dock beside Kate and Odgar.He could hear the Ghee and Bill swimming way out in the dark.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是最棒的跳水者，韦姆奇。”凯特说着，用脚碰了碰他的后背。尼克被她一碰，身体有一种绷紧的感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re the most wonderful diver, Wemedge,” Kate said, touching his back with her foot.Nick tightened under the contact.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你就是个奇迹，韦姆奇。”奥德加说。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re a wonder, Wemedge,” Odgar said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有啊。”尼克说。他在想，在想是不是有可能和某个人一起呆在水下，他可以屏住呼吸三分钟，踩着水底的沙子，他们能够一起浮上去，换换气再下来，要是知道窍门的话沉下去是很容易的。有一次，他为了炫耀一下，在水下喝了一瓶牛奶，剥了一根香蕉，还吃了下去，不过还是得借助点重力才能留在水下，要是水底有个圆环，能让他用胳膊勾住，就差不多了。哎，怎么可能呢，连个姑娘都找不到，一个姑娘是做不了这个的，她肯定会灌一肚子水的，要是凯特的话就给淹死了，凯特可不会潜水，他希望有这么一个姑娘，也许他能找到一个这样的姑娘，也许永远都找不到，除了他，还有谁有这样的潜水功夫呢。会游泳，该死，会游泳的都是笨蛋，除了他没人有这样的好水性，在埃文斯顿倒是有一个家伙，可以屏气屏六分钟，不过他是个疯子。他希望自己是条鱼，不，也不好。他笑了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nope,” Nick said.He was thinking, thinking if it was possible to be with somebody underwater, he could hold his breath three minutes, against the sand on the bottom, they could float up together, take a breath and go down, it was easy to sink if you knew how.He had once drunk a bottle of milk and peeled and eaten a banana underwater to show off, had to have weights, though, to hold him down, if there was a ring at the bottom, something he could get his arm through, he could do it all right.Gee, how it would be, you couldn’t ever get a girl though, a girl couldn’t go through with it, she’d swallow water, it would drown Kate, Kate wasn’t really any good underwater, he wished there was a girl like that, maybe he’d get a girl like that, probably never, there wasn’t anybody but him that was that way underwater.Swimmers, hell, swimmers were slobs, nobody knew about the water but him, there was a fellow up at Evanston that could hold his breath six minutes but he was crazy.He wished he was a fish, no he didn’t.He laughed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“笑什么呢，韦姆奇？”奥德加声音沙哑地说道，是跟凯特亲近时的口气。</td>
