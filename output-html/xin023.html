		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There was once a turtle who lived among a great many people of different kinds, in a large camp near a big river which was born right up amongst the snows, and flowed straight away south till it reached a sea where the water was always hot.</td>
		<td class="en">从前有一只海龟，他和许多不同种类的动物生活在一处很大的营地里，营地不远处是一条由雪水形成的大河，河水一直向南流淌，直至汇入温热的海洋。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >There were many other turtles in the camp, and this turtle was kind and pleasant to them all, but he did not care for any of them very much, and felt rather lonely.</td>
		<td class="en">这片营地里还有许多其他的海龟，这只海龟对他们善良友好，但他并没有特别喜欢他们中的任何一只，他感到十分孤独。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At last he built himself a hut, and filled it with skins for seats, and made it as comfortable as any hut for miles round; and when it was quite finished he looked about among the young women to see which of them he should ask to be his wife.</td>
		<td class="en">最后他为自己修建了一座小屋，里面堆满了毛皮当座椅，使它和周围几里以外的所有小屋一样舒适。当小屋快要建好时，他便在所有年轻的女子中寻找适合的人选来成为他妻子。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >It took him some time to make up his mind, for no turtle likes being hurried, but at length he found one girl who seemed prettier and more industrious than the rest, and one day he entered her home, and said: ‘Will you marry me?’</td>
		<td class="en">因为海龟做事总是慢吞吞的，所以他做决定的时候花了一些时间。但是最终他找到了一个姑娘，那姑娘看起来比其他姑娘更加美丽，更加勤劳。有一天，他来到了这个姑娘家里，说：“你愿意嫁给我吗？”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘I can keep up with the best of them,’ replied the turtle, tossing his head.</td>

		<td class="en">之后他回到了自己的小屋，便马上着手做准备出征。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The first thing he did was to call all his relations together, and ask them if they would come with him and make war on the people of a neighbouring village.</td>
		<td class="en">他做的第一件事就是把他所有的亲戚叫到一起，询问他们是否愿意和他一道向邻村人发起一场战争。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The turtles, who were tired of doing nothing, agreed at once, and next day the whole tribe left the camp.</td>
		<td class="en">那些厌倦了整日无所事事的海龟马上同意了他的建议。第二天，部落里所有的海龟都离开了营地。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The girl was standing at the door of her hut as they passed, and laughed out loud—they moved so slowly.</td>
		<td class="en">他们走过姑娘的小屋前时，姑娘正站在门口，她大声笑了起来——他们前进的速度如此之慢。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“四天后，”姑娘回答道——她之所以答应和他结婚就是要摆脱他——“四天后你还是很难离开我的视线。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Oh, I did not mean four days, but four YEARS,’ answered the turtle, hastily; ‘whatever happens I shall be back by then.’</td>
		<td class="en">“哦，我不是指四天，而是四年，”海龟草率地回答道，“无论发生什么，我都会在四年后回来。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The army marched on, till one day, when they felt as if they must have got half round the earth, though they were scarcely four miles from the camp, they found a large tree lying across their path.</td>
		<td class="en">部队在前进，直到有一天，他们感觉自己仿佛已经走了半个地球，然而实际上才离开营地四英里。这时，他们发现前方的路上横着一棵大树。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They looked at it with dismay, and the oldest among them put their heads together to see what was to be done.</td>
		<td class="en">他们失望地看着这棵树，其中最年长的海龟们聚在一起商量应该怎么办。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Can’t we manage to get past by the top?’ asked one.</td>
		<td class="en">“我们难道不能设法从树顶上通过吗？”其中一只问道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Why, it would take us YEARS,’ exclaimed another.</td>
		<td class="en">“什么？那可能要花费我们几年的时间。”另一只大声说，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Just look at all those tall green branches, spreading in every direction.</td>
		<td class="en">“你们看看这些向四周蔓延、又长又绿的枝条。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >If once we got entangled in THEM, we should never get out again!’</td>
		<td class="en">如果我们一旦缠在里面，就再也出不来了！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Well then, let us go round by the bottom,’ said a third.</td>
		<td class="en">“那么这样吧，我们绕着底部走过去。”第三只海龟说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘How are we to do that, when the roots have made a deep hole, and above that is a high bank?’ replied a fourth.</td>
		<td class="en">“我们怎么过去？树根已经在地面上弄了一个很深的洞，上方还是高堤。”第四只海龟回答道，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘No; the only way I can think of, is to burn a large hole in the trunk.’</td>
		<td class="en">“不，我认为唯一可行的方法是在树干上烧出一个大洞。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" > And this they did, but the trunk was very thick, and would not burn through.</td>
		<td class="en">他们确实这么做了，但是树干过于粗厚，烧不穿它。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘It is no use, we must give it up,’ they agreed at last.</td>
		<td class="en">“没用，我们必须放弃。”他们最终达成一致，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘After all, nobody need ever know!</td>
		<td class="en">“毕竟，没有人会知道！</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >We have been away such a long while that we might easily have had all sorts of adventures.’</td>
		<td class="en">我们已经走了这么长时间，可能很容易就遇见各种各样的困难。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" > And so the whole company turned homewards again.</td>
		<td class="en">所以整个队伍又掉头朝家的方向走去。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They took even longer to go back than they had to come, for they were tired and footsore with their journey.</td>
		<td class="en">由于他们都很累，行程让他们的脚感到酸痛，因此回去的时间远比出发的时间要长。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When they drew near the camp they plucked up their courage, and began to sing a war-song.</td>
		<td class="en">他们靠近营地时，又鼓足了勇气，准备唱一首战歌。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At this the villagers came flocking to see what spoils the turtles had won, but, as they approached, each turtle seized some one by the wrist, exclaiming: ‘You are our spoils; you are our prisoners!’</td>
		<td class="en">面对这番情形，村民都聚在了一起看看他们获得了什么战利品。但当他们靠近时，每只海龟都抓住了一个村民的手腕，大声喊道：“你们是我们的战利品，你们是我们的俘虏！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Now that I have got you I will keep you,’ said the leader, who had happened to seize his betrothed.</td>
		<td class="en">“既然我抓到了你，我就会把你留下。”首领说，他碰巧抓住了他的未婚妻。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Everybody was naturally very angry at this behaviour, and the girl most of all, and in her secret heart she determined to have her revenge.</td>
		<td class="en">每个人自然都对这种举动表示很气愤，尤其是那个姑娘，她决定秘密地展开报复行动。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But, just at present, the turtles were too strong, so the prisoners had to put on their smartest slippers and their brightest clothes, and dance a war dance while the turtles sang.</td>
		<td class="en">但是眼下，这些海龟过于强壮，所以俘虏们不得不穿上最漂亮的拖鞋和最鲜艳的服装，在海龟的歌声下跳一场战舞。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >They danced so long that it seemed as if they would never stop, till the turtle who was leading the singing suddenly broke into a loud chant:</td>
		<td class="en">他们跳了很长时间，好像永远都不会停下，直到领歌的海龟突然大声喊起来：</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Whoever comes here, will die, will die!</td>
		<td class="en">“无论谁来这儿都要死，都要死！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At this all the dancers grew so frightened that they burst through the ring of their captors, and ran back to the village, the turtles following—very slowly.</td>
		<td class="en">此时所有跳舞的人都感到十分惊恐，他们冲出了逮捕者们的包围，朝村子跑去，海龟跟在他们后面——速度慢极了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >On the way the chief turtle met a man, who said to him:</td>
		<td class="en">在路上，领头的海龟遇到了一个人，他对海龟说：</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“那个答应成为你妻子的女人已经和别人结婚了！”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Is that true?’ said the turtle.</td>
		<td class="en">“真的吗？”海龟说道，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Then I must see him.’</td>
		<td class="en">“那我必须见见他。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >But as soon as the villager was out of sight the turtle stopped, and taking a bundle containing fringes and ornaments from his back, he hung them about him, so that they rattled as he walked.</td>
		<td class="en">那个村民一消失不见，海龟就停止了追逐，从后面拿出了一束有流苏和装饰物的捆子，吊在了自己面前。这样，他在走的时候，那捆子就会不停地发出丁零当啷的碰撞声。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When he was quite close to the hut where the woman lived, he cried out:</td>
		<td class="en">当海龟离那个女人家不远的时候，他喊道：</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Here I am to claim the woman who promised to be my wife.’</td>
		<td class="en">“我来这是要带走之前答应嫁给我的女人。”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Come with me,’ he said sternly.</td>
		<td class="en">“跟我来。”他坚定地说。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘You broke your promise,’ answered she.</td>
		<td class="en">“你违背了诺言，”她回答道。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘You said you would be back soon, and it is more than a year since you went!</td>

		<td class="en">我怎么知道你还活着？”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At her words the husband took courage, and spoke hastily:</td>
		<td class="en">听了她的话，丈夫鼓起了勇气连忙说：</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Yes, you promised you would go to war and bring back some prisoners, and you have not done it.’</td>
		<td class="en">“是啊，你答应过你要去参加战争，并且会带回来一些俘虏，可你并没有做到啊。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘I DID go, and made many prisoners,’ retorted the turtle angrily, drawing out his knife.</td>
		<td class="en">“我确实去了，也抓了许多俘虏，”海龟气愤地反驳道，抽出刀子，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Look here, if she won’t be MY wife, she sha’n’t be YOURS.</td>
		<td class="en">“听着，如果她不能够成为我的妻子，也不会成为你的妻子。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I will cut her in two; and you shall have one half, and I the other.’</td>
		<td class="en">我会把她切成两半；你占有一半，我占有另一半。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘But half a woman is no use to me,’ answered the man.</td>
		<td class="en">“但是半个女人对我来说没有用，”他回答说，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘If you want her so much you had better take her.’</td>
		<td class="en">“如果你这么想要她，那么最好把她带走。”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" > And the turtle, followed by his relations, carried her off to his own hut.</td>
		<td class="en">于是，海龟就在亲戚们的跟随下，把她带回了自己家。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >Now the woman saw she would gain nothing by being sulky, so she pretended to be very glad to have got rid of her husband; but all the while she was trying to invent a plan to deliver herself from the turtle.</td>
		<td class="en">现在，这个女人发现生气一点儿用都没有，所以她假装自己非常开心，能够摆脱她的丈夫，其实她始终都在构思一个能够摆脱海龟的计划。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >At length she remembered that one of her friends had a large iron pot, and when the turtle had gone to his room to put away his fringes, she ran over to her neighbour’s and brought it back.</td>
		<td class="en">最后，她想起来自己的一个朋友有一口大铁锅，于是当海龟回到自己的屋子放好他的流苏装饰物时，她马上跑到邻居家把那口锅取来。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Just warming some water,’ she answered.</td>
		<td class="en">“就是热点儿水。”她回答说，</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Do you know how to swim?’</td>
