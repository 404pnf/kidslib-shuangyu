		<td class="en">He laid aside his coat and hat gently, lingeringly, as though he had time and to spare for everything, or as though he were taking leave of them for ever, and came over to the fire and held out his hands to the quick, leaping flame.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Just for a moment both of them stood silent in that leaping light.Still, as it were, they tasted on their smiling lips the sweet shock of their greeting.Their secret selves whispered:</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Oh, you.”He thumped the Armenian cushion and flung on to the sommier.“You’re a perfect little Chinese.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错。”她笑着说。“我就像男人们想喝酒那样总想喝茶。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, I am,” she laughed.“I long for tea as strong men long for wine.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她点上宽大的橘色灯罩下的灯，拉上窗帘，然后把茶桌挪近了些。水壶里像是有两只小鸟在唱歌；火苗跳动着。他坐起身，双手抱膝。喝茶真是件令人愉快的事情，并且她总有好吃的食物——又小又尖的三明治、短的甜杏仁酥条，以及带很多奶油的朗姆酒口味的深色点心。可喝茶终究是一种干扰。他希望茶能早些喝完，这样他们就可以移开桌子，然后将椅子移到灯旁。这时，他就可以掏出烟斗，装上烟叶，并且边往烟斗里按边说：“我一直在想你上次说过的话，我觉得……”</td>
		<td class="en">She lighted the lamp under its broad orange shade, pulled the curtains, and drew up the tea table.Two birds sang in the kettle; the fire fluttered.He sat up clasping his knees.It was delightful—this business of having tea—and she always had delicious things to eat—little sharp sandwiches, short sweet almond fingers, and a dark, rich cake tasting of rum—but it was an interruption.He wanted it over, the table pushed away, their two chairs drawn up to the light, and the moment came when he took out his pipe, filled it, and said, pressing the tobacco tight into the bowl: “I have been thinking over what you said last time and it seems to me....”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >是的，那正是他和她所期待的。是的，当她在酒精灯的火焰上晃动着茶壶来烤热烘干它时，她看到了他们两个人：他舒适地躺在靠垫上，而她则蜗牛般地蜷缩在蓝色的贝壳状扶手椅上。那画面是如此地清晰、精致，好像已被绘制在蓝色的壶盖上。可是她可不能慌慌张张。她几乎要喊：“给我点时间吧。”她确实是需要时间来平静。她需要时间来摆脱这使她的生活如此有声有色的这熟悉的一切。所有这些令人愉悦的事物，包括她的孩子，都是她的一部分。他们明白这一点，因而他们总是最大限度地肆意向她提各种要求。可是现在他们必须要走了。她得把他们打发走——像孩子一样把他们赶走，把他们赶到昏暗的楼上，塞到被子里，命令他们马上睡觉，不能吭一声！</td>
		<td class="en">Yes, that was what he waited for and so did she.Yes, while she shook the teapot hot and dry over the spirit flame she saw those other two, him, leaning back, taking his ease among the cushions, and her, curled up en escargot in the blue shell arm-chair.The picture was so clear and so minute it might have been painted on the blue teapot lid.And yet she couldn’t hurry.She could almost have cried: “Give me time.”She must have time in which to grow calm.She wanted time in which to free herself from all these familiar things with which she lived so vividly.For all these gay things round her were part of her—her offspring—and they knew it and made the largest, most vehement claims.But now they must go.They must be swept away, shooed away—like children, sent up the shadowy stairs, packed into bed, and commanded to go to sleep—at once—without a murmur!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为他们两人友谊的那种特殊的兴奋使他们完全不能自持了。他们的两颗心，就像某处浩瀚平原上的两座开放的城市一样，对彼此都敞开着。他，并没有像全副武装的征服者那样，骑马直驱她的城门，无视一切，只顾自己内心的兴奋；而她，也没有像女王那样踩着花瓣轻轻地走进他的城门。不，他们都是热心而严肃的旅行者，沉浸于理解自己所看到的景物并发现那景致后所隐藏的一切。他们都想充分利用这一绝好机会使彼此对对方都毫无隐瞒。</td>
		<td class="en">For the special thrilling quality of their friendship was in their complete surrender.Like two open cities in the midst of some vast plain their two minds lay open to each other.And it wasn’t as if he rode into hers like a conqueror, armed to the eyebrows and seeing nothing but a gay silken flutter—nor did she enter his like a queen walking soft on petals.No, they were eager, serious travellers, absorbed in understanding what was to be seen and discovering what was hidden—making the most of this extraordinary absolute chance which made it possible for him to be utterly truthful to her and for her to be utterly sincere with him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最妙之处是，他们的年龄足够使他们从这种探险当中获得极大的乐趣，而不至于产生愚蠢的感情纠葛。情欲会破坏掉一切，他们已看透这一点。何况他们都早已经历过那些事情——他都31岁了，而她也30了——他们各自都有过丰富多样的经历。而现在，是该由他们来收获的时候了——收获。他的小说不都要是长篇巨著吗？还有她的剧本也是。还有谁能像她那样能够细致入微地理解地道的英国喜剧？……</td>
		<td class="en">And the best of it was they were both of them old enough to enjoy their adventure to the full without any stupid emotional complication.Passion would have ruined everything; they quite saw that.Besides, all that sort of thing was over and done with for both of them—he was thirty-one, she was thirty—they had had their experiences, and very rich and varied they had been, but now was the time for harvest—harvest.Weren’t his novels to be very big novels indeed?And her plays.Who else had her exquisite sense of real English Comedy?...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她把点心仔细地切成厚厚的小块。他伸手拿了一块。</td>
		<td class="en">Carefully she cut the cake into thick little wads and he reached across for a piece.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“尝尝有多好吃。”她恳求道，“边想象边吃。如果可以的话，转转你的眼睛，然后呼吸间品尝它的美味。这可不是随便拿来的一个三明治——这可完全有可能是《创世纪》里提到的那种点心。上帝说：‘要有点心。于是就有了点心。上帝看见后觉得很好。’”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you realize how good it is,” she implored.“Eat it imaginatively.Roll your eyes if you can and taste it on the breath.It’s not a sandwich from the hatter’s bag—it’s the kind of cake that might have been mentioned in the Book of Genesis....And God said: ‘Let there be cake.And there was cake.And God saw that it was good.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不必恳求我，” 他说，“真的不必。很奇怪，在这儿吃东西时我总知道自己是在吃什么，但在别处吃就没有这种感觉。我想这可能是由于这些年来我独自生活的缘故吧。我总是一边看书一边吃东西……我习惯了把食物只看成食物……某些时候，有东西吃我就狼吞虎咽一通，要是没有，就……”他笑了起来，“你一定大吃一惊。是吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You needn’t entreat me,” said he.“Really you needn’t.It’s a queer thing but I always do notice what I eat here and never anywhere else.I suppose it comes of living alone so long and always reading while I feed... my habit of looking upon food as just food... something that’s there, at certain times... to be devoured... to be... not there.”He laughed.“That shocks you.Doesn’t it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“吃惊极了。”她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“To the bone,” said she.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是——你瞧——”他推开杯子，口若悬河地讲了起来，“我从未在外面生活过。我一点也叫不上东西的名字，比如树木呀等等。而且我从不注意地点啊，或是家具啊，或是人们的特点啊。屋子对我来说都一样——就是一个可以坐、可以读书或是谈话的地方，除了——”讲到这儿，他顿了一下，然后古怪而天真地笑了笑，并接着说，“除了这个工作室。”他看了看四周，然后看着她。他笑了，笑声里充满着惊奇和喜悦。他就像是一个人坐火车，醒来却发现自己已经到达了目的地。</td>
		<td class="en">“But—look here—” He pushed away his cup and began to speak very fast.“I simply haven’t got any external life at all.I don’t know the names of things a bit—trees and so on—and I never notice places or furniture or what people look like.One room is just like another to me—a place to sit and read or talk in—except,” and here he paused, smiled in a strange naive way, and said, “except this studio.”He looked round him and then at her; he laughed in his astonishment and pleasure.He was like a man who wakes up in a train to find that he has arrived, already, at the journey’s end.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还有一件很奇怪的事。如果我闭上眼睛，脑子里就会浮现出这个地方的每一个细节——所有细节……现在想起来，之前我都没意识到这一点。我不在这里的时候，经常就会在脑海里重访此地——徘徊在你的那些红椅子间，凝视着那黑桌上的水果盆——只是轻轻地抚摸一下熟睡中的男孩的头都会让我感到新奇。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here’s another queer thing.If I shut my eyes I can see this place down to every detail—every detail....Now I come to think of it—I’ve never realized this consciously before.Often when I am away from here I revisit it in spirit—wander about among your red chairs, stare at the bowl of fruit on the black table—and just touch, very lightly, that marvel of a sleeping boy’s head.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一边说一边看着小男孩。小男孩站在壁炉的一角，脑袋垂向一边，双唇张开，好像在睡梦中听到了什么悦耳的声音……</td>
		<td class="en">He looked at it as he spoke.It stood on the corner of the mantelpiece; the head to one side down-drooping, the lips parted, as though in his sleep the little boy listened to some sweet sound....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我喜欢这小男孩。”他低语道。之后，他们都沉默了。</td>
		<td class="en">“I love that little boy,” he murmured.And then they both were silent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两人又重新陷入了沉默。这一点也不像他们打过招呼之后的那种令人舒服坦然的停顿——“ 啊，我们又见面了，不妨接着上次停下的地方继续谈。”那沉默被温暖的、令人愉悦的炉火和灯光所形成的圈围了起来。有多少次，他们都想往这圈里投点什么，就为看看这平缓的岸边会惊起怎样的波澜。可是那个孩子却一直沉睡，脑袋垂向这并不常见的池塘。于是，涟漪随波而去，流向远方，流入那深邃的、闪着光亮的黑暗中。</td>
		<td class="en">A new silence came between them.Nothing in the least like the satisfactory pause that had followed their greetings—the “Well, here we are together again, and there’s no reason why we shouldn’t go on from just where we left off last time.”That silence could be contained in the circle of warm, delightful fire and lamplight.How many times hadn’t they flung something into it just for the fun of watching the ripples break on the easy shores.But into this unfamiliar pool the head of the little boy sleeping his timeless sleep dropped—and the ripples flowed away, away—boundlessly far—into deep glittering darkness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，两人都打破了沉默。她说：“我得把火生起来。”他说：“我一直在尝试一种新的……” 两个人都在回避。她生起火之后，把桌子推回了原处，并把蓝色的椅子朝前推了推，然后就蜷缩在了上面，而他则朝后仰了仰，躺在了靠垫上。赶快！赶快！他们决不能再让这样的事情发生了。</td>
		<td class="en">And then both of them broke it.She said: “I must make up the fire,” and he said: “I have been trying a new...” Both of them escaped.She made up the fire and put the table back, the blue chair was wheeled forward, she curled up and he lay back among the cushions.Quickly!Quickly!They must stop it from happening again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，我看完了你上次留下的那本书。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I read the book you left last time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，你觉得那书怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, what do you think of it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们又开始沉默了，一切又恢复了原状。可真是这样吗？他们是不是回答得太快、太顺口了，以至于两人都没法再继续下去？这难道不是某种场合的绝妙模仿吗？他的心急剧地跳动，而她的两颊似乎也在燃烧。蠢的是，她无法发现他们此时身处何地或是此时正在发生何事。她没那么多时间来回顾了。而正在这时，事情又发生了。他们支支吾吾、犹豫不决、垮了下来，他们默不作声。他们又一次意识到了那无边无际的、满是疑虑的黑暗。他们又开始像两个猎手那样在那里俯身烤火，但两人忽然听到从远处丛林里传来的一阵风的呼啸声和一声响亮的、质问的叫喊……</td>
		<td class="en">They were off and all was as usual.But was it?Weren’t they just a little too quick, too prompt with their replies, too ready to take each other up?Was this really anything more than a wonderfully good imitation of other occasions?His heart beat; her cheek burned and the stupid thing was she could not discover where exactly they were or what exactly was happening.She hadn’t time to glance back.And just as she had got so far it happened again.They faltered, wavered, broke down, were silent.Again they were conscious of the boundless, questioning dark.Again, there they were—two hunters, bending over their fire, but hearing suddenly from the jungle beyond a shake of wind and a loud, questioning cry....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她抬起了头。“下雨了。”她喃喃地说着。而且她的声音就像他刚才说“我喜欢这小男孩”时所用的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">She lifted her head.“It’s raining,” she murmured.And her voice was like his when he had said: “I love that little boy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，他们为什么不做出让步，做出妥协，看看究竟会发生什么？但是这不会发生。虽然他们思维模糊，充满困惑，但是他们很清楚地意识到：他们之间那份弥足珍贵的友谊正处于危险之中。被毁灭的将会是她而非他们，他们与此事无关。</td>
		<td class="en">Well.Why didn’t they just give way to it—yield—and see what will happen then?But no.Vague and troubled though they were, they knew enough to realize their precious friendship was in danger.She was the one who would be destroyed—not they—and they’d be no party to that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他站了起来，敲净烟斗，用手捋了捋头发，然后说：“最近我一直在思考，未来的小说是否会是心理小说。心理学作为一门学问，同文学有一定关系，你对此有几分肯定？”</td>
		<td class="en">He got up, knocked out his pipe, ran his hand through his hair, and said: “I have been wondering very much lately whether the novel of the future will be a psychological novel or not.How sure are you that psychology qua psychology has got anything to do with literature at all?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的意思是说，你觉得那些神秘而不存在的人物，即当代的年轻作家，也完全能做到心理分析家所能做到的吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you mean you feel there’s quite a chance that the mysterious non-existent creatures—the young writers of to-day—are trying simply to jump the psycho-analyst’s claim?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，我就是这样认为的。而且，我觉得这是因为这一代人足够聪明，能够知晓这个社会是病态的，并意识到要使它恢复健康，唯一的办法就是探究其症状——做一番详尽的研究，寻根究源，弄个水落石出。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, I do.And I think it’s because this generation is just wise enough to know that it is sick and to realize that its only chance of recovery is by going into its symptoms—making an exhaustive study of them—tracking them down—trying to get at the root of the trouble.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是，唉，”她悲叹，“前景是多么地惨淡可怕啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">“But oh,” she wailed.“What a dreadfully dismal outlook.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“根本不会，他说，“你瞧……”谈话继续进行了。现在看来，他们是真的做到了。她一边坐在椅子上转过身来望着他，一边回答他。她的笑容似乎在说：“ 我们成功了。”他也朝她笑了笑，信心十足，仿佛在说：“ 确实如此。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not at all,” said he.“Look here... “ On the talk went.And now it seemed they really had succeeded.She turned in her chair to look at him while she answered.Her smile said: “We have won.”And he smiled back, confident: “Absolutely.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是这一笑可坏了事。他们的微笑因为时间太长反而成了咧嘴傻笑。他们看到自己像个咧着嘴笑的木偶，蹦蹦跳跳，却不知为何。</td>
		<td class="en">But the smile undid them.It lasted too long; it became a grin.They saw themselves as two little grinning puppets jigging away in nothingness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“刚才我们谈到哪儿了？”他想道。他觉得无聊至极，几乎要呻吟了。</td>
		<td class="en">“What have we been talking about?” thought he.He was so utterly bored he almost groaned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们让自己出了多大的一个洋相。”她想道。她觉得他在吃力地——的确——在吃力地进行布置，而她则跟在后面跑，忙着这儿种一棵树，那儿栽一丛花，又回头在池塘里放一些闪光的鱼。这时，他们又沉默不语了，这完全是由于沮丧。</td>
		<td class="en">“What a spectacle we have made of ourselves,” thought she.And she saw him laboriously—oh, laboriously—laying out the grounds and herself running after, puffing here a tree and there a flowery shrub and here a handful of glittering fish in a pool.They were silent this time from sheer dismay.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时钟轻轻地敲了六下，而炉火也微微跳动了一阵。他们真是愚蠢——沉重、乏味、老迈——然而心灵却非常活跃。</td>
		<td class="en">The clock struck six merry little pings and the fire made a soft flutter.What fools they were—heavy, stodgy, elderly—with positively upholstered minds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此刻，沉默就像是庄严的音乐一样，在他们身上都施了巫术。真是煎熬啊，她忍受着这种煎熬，而他也几乎要死去了。要是沉默一旦被打破，那他就会真的死去……然而他又渴望打破这沉默。不是通过言语。反正不是用他们那种平庸的、令人发疯的闲聊。还有一种新的方法可以让他们彼此开始说话。新的方法就是他想要低声说：“你也有这种感觉吗？对此你究竟是否理解？”……</td>
		<td class="en">And now the silence put a spell upon them like solemn music.It was anguish—anguish for her to bear it and he would die—he’d die if it were broken....And yet he longed to break it.Not by speech.At any rate not by their ordinary maddening chatter.There was another way for them to speak to each other, and in the new way he wanted to murmur: “Do you feel this too?Do you understand it at all?”...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他反而听到自己说：“ 我得走了，我和布兰德约好六点见面。” 这使他觉得恐惧。</td>
		<td class="en">Instead, to his horror, he heard himself say: “I must be off; I’m meeting Brand at six.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >真是见鬼，他怎么会说了这些而不是其他的呢？她跳起来——直接从椅子上跳起来。接着，他听到她喊道：“那你赶快走吧。他如此守时。你之前怎么不说？”</td>
		<td class="en">What devil made him say that instead of the other?She jumped—simply jumped out of her chair, and he heard her crying: “You must rush, then.He’s so punctual.Why didn’t you say so before?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你伤害了我，你伤害了我！我们失败了！”她心里这样想，却佯装笑脸把他的帽子和手杖递给他。她不等他再说一句话，就直接跑过走廊，给他打开外面的大门。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ve hurt me; you’ve hurt me!We’ve failed!”said her secret self while she handed him his hat and stick, smiling gaily.She wouldn’t give him a moment for another word, but ran along the passage and opened the big outer door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们能这样就分手告别吗？怎么能呢？他站在台阶上，而她就站在屋里，手扶着门。此刻雨已经不下了。</td>
		<td class="en">Could they leave each other like this?How could they?He stood on the step and she just inside holding the door.It was not raining now.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你伤害了我——伤害了我。”她心想。“你怎么还不走呢？不，别走了。留下来吧。不，还是走吧！”她仰望着夜空。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’ve hurt me—hurt me,” said her heart.“Why don’t you go?No, don’t go.Stay.No—go!”And she looked out upon the night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她看到一级一级的台阶，十分漂亮。夜色中的花园里，到处都是闪着光的常春藤。马路对面是硕大的、光秃秃的杨柳。杨柳上方是广袤的、星光闪烁的夜空。当然，他是不会去看这一切的。他比这些更胜一筹。他——拥有“精神上的”美妙视野！</td>
		<td class="en">She saw the beautiful fall of the steps, the dark garden ringed with glittering ivy, on the other side of the road the huge bare willows and above them the sky big and bright with stars.But of course he would see nothing of all this.He was superior to it all.He—with his wonderful “spiritual” vision!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她想的是对的。他确实什么都没看到。真不幸！他错过了时机。现在太晚了，做什么什么都来不及。是太晚了吗？是的，太晚了。一阵令人厌恶的冷风吹进了花园。该死的生命！他听到她喊了声“再见”后，门就猛地关上了。</td>
		<td class="en">She was right.He did see nothing at all.Misery!He’d missed it.It was too late to do anything now.Was it too late?Yes, it was.A cold snatch of hateful wind blew into the garden.Curse life!He heard her cry “au revoir” and the door slammed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她跑回工作室后，行为举止怪了起来。她举着手臂来回跑，大声叫着：“啊！啊！多么愚蠢！多么弱智！多么愚蠢！”然后，她扑倒在垫子上，脑海里一片空白——她只是躺在那里生气。一切都结束了。是什么结束了？啊，反正是有什么事情结束了。她再也见不到他了——再也见不到了。在这黑暗的漩涡里，她呆了很长一段时间（大概有十分钟）。突然，门铃发出了刺耳且急促的一声。一定是他。同样，她当然丝毫不该去理睬，就让那门铃响下去，一直响下去。然而，她却飞快地去开门。</td>
		<td class="en">Running back into the studio she behaved so strangely.She ran up and down lifting her arms and crying: “Oh!Oh!How stupid!How imbecile!How stupid!”And then she flung herself down on the sommier thinking of nothing—just lying there in her rage.All was over.What was over?Oh—something was.And she’d never see him again—never.After a long long time (or perhaps ten minutes) had passed in that black gulf her bell rang a sharp quick jingle.It was he, of course.And equally, of course, she oughtn’t to have paid the slightest attention to it but just let it go on ringing and ringing.She flew to answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >门阶上站着一个可怜巴巴的老处女。这人简直把她奉为偶像（天知道为什么）。她有这样一个习惯：现身之后按一下门铃，然后在门开了之后说：“我亲爱的，打发我走吧！”当然了，她从没打发她走过。照往常，她会让她进来，任她去欣赏一切，然后十分文雅地从她手里接过一束看上去稍稍弄脏了的鲜花。可是今天……</td>
		<td class="en">On the doorstep there stood an elderly virgin, a pathetic creature who simply idolized her (heaven knows why) and had this habit of turning up and ringing the bell and then saying, when she opened the door: “My dear, send me away!”She never did.As a rule she asked her in and let her admire everything and accepted the bunch of slightly soiled looking flowers—more than graciously.But to-day...</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，真抱歉，”她喊道，“可是我有客人。我们在搞一些木刻。我整个晚上都特别忙。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I am so sorry,” she cried.“But I’ve got someone with me.We are working on some wood-cuts.I’m hopelessly busy all evening.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没关系。根本没关系，亲爱的。”这个好朋友说。“我只是路过这里，想留些紫罗兰给你。”她在一把很大的旧伞的伞骨里翻找着。“我把花放在这儿了。放这儿最好，风吹不着。原来在这儿啊。”她边说边抖出一小把干枯的花。</td>
		<td class="en">“It doesn’t matter.It doesn’t matter at all, darling,” said the good friend.“I was just passing and I thought I’d leave you some violets.”She fumbled down among the ribs of a large old umbrella.“I put them down here.Such a good place to keep flowers out of the wind.Here they are,” she said, shaking out a little dead bunch.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一时间她并没有去接过那些紫罗兰。可是，当她站在里面扶着门时，一件奇怪的事情发生了。她又看到那一级一级漂亮的台阶，那在夜色笼罩下到处都是闪着光亮的常春藤的花园，还有那杨柳以及那星光闪烁的夜空。她再次感觉到满是疑虑的沉默。但是，这次她没有再犹豫。她走上前去。她轻轻地、温柔地把双臂搭在她朋友的身上，仿佛生怕会在那静谧无垠的池塘里泛起涟漪似的。</td>
		<td class="en">For a moment she did not take the violets.But while she stood just inside, holding the door, a strange thing happened.Again she saw the beautiful fall of the steps, the dark garden ringed with glittering ivy, the willows, the big bright sky.Again she felt the silence that was like a question.But this time she did not hesitate.She moved forward.Very softly and gently, as though fearful of making a ripple in that boundless pool of quiet she put her arms round her friend.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的，”她那位高兴的朋友满是感激地说，“这真没什么。就是仅值三个便士的小花束而已。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My dear,” murmured her happy friend, quite overcome by this gratitude.“They are really nothing.Just the simplest little thrippenny bunch.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她话还没说完就被抱住了——比刚才更加温柔、更加体贴。被人亲切地紧紧搂住，而且持续了那么久，这个可怜的女人觉得晕晕乎乎的。她用仅剩的那点力气，颤颤巍巍地说：“那你真的不怎么介意我咯？”</td>
		<td class="en">But as she spoke she was enfolded—more tenderly, more beautifully embraced, held by such a sweet pressure and for so long that the poor dear’s mind positively reeled and she just had the strength to quaver: “Then you really don’t mind me too much?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“晚安，我的朋友，” 她低声说，“以后再来吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good night, my friend,” whispered the other.“Come again soon.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，我会的。我会的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I will.I will.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这次她缓缓地走回工作室，站在房子中央，半闭着眼睛。那感觉就好像是刚从童年的一次睡眠中醒来一样，是如此轻松，如此舒适。就连呼吸都成了一种愉悦……</td>
		<td class="en">This time she walked back to the studio slowly, and standing in the middle of the room with half-shut eyes she felt so light, so rested, as if she had woken up out of a childish sleep.Even the act of breathing was a joy....</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >躺椅上很是凌乱。正如她所说，那些靠垫“就像是愤怒的山峰” 。她把靠垫摆放整齐，然后走向了书桌。</td>
		<td class="en">The sommier was very untidy.All the cushions “like furious mountains” as she said; she put them in order before going over to the writing-table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我一直在想我们关于心理小说的那些话，” 她快速写下，“这确实很有意思……” 诸如此类。</td>
		<td class="en">“I have been thinking over our talk about the psychological novel,” she dashed off, “it really is intensely interesting.”...And so on and so on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >结束时，她写道：“ 晚安，我的朋友。不久再来。”</td>
		<td class="en">At the end she wrote: “Good night, my friend.Come again soon.”</td></tr>
