		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没有必要向那些对什么事情都好奇的公众去解释我是怎样学到足够的法律知识，从而经营好自己小世界里的事务的吧？如果是那样，我不就必须要公开表明一下我对一个既和蔼又聪明的人的记忆了吗？他在一次舞会上遇到一位抄写员（另一个非专业职员）时说：“正好办公室有个机会，有你可以做的工作，我敢向你打包票。”但我认为，你不需要公开的证明，也一定很确信地感到作者的情谊了吧？</td>
		<td class="en">Is it not a necessity to explain to a public curious to know everything, how I came to be sufficiently learned in the law to carry on the business of my little world?And in so doing, am I not bound to put on record the memory of the amiable and intelligent man who, meeting the Scribe (another clerk-amateur) at a ball, said, “Just give the office a turn; there is work for you there, I assure you”?But do you need this public testimony to feel assured of the affection of the writer?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一七九三年一月二十二日，临近傍晚八点，一位老妇人沿着笔陡的街道走来。街道尽头对着圣马丁郊区的圣洛朗教堂。由于整个白天下了很大的雪，老妇人踩在地上的脚步声几乎都听不见。街道都很荒芜，在这种死寂的环境下，她很自然地感到很恐惧。而近来让法国呻吟不已的恐怖更是加剧了她的恐惧感。此外，到目前为止，老妇人这一路上一个人也没有遇到。她的视力已经减退很久了，因此，凭借着街灯的光亮，她是很难看见如同影子般散布在圣马丁郊外宽阔大道上寥寥无几的行人的。</td>
		<td class="en">On the 22nd of January, 1793, towards eight o’clock in the evening, an old lady came down the steep street that comes to an end opposite the Church of Saint Laurent in the Faubourg Saint Martin.It had snowed so heavily all day long that the lady’s footsteps were scarcely audible; the streets were deserted, and a feeling of dread, not unnatural amid the silence, was further increased by the whole extent of the Terror beneath which France was groaning in those days; what was more, the old lady so far had met no one by the way.Her sight had long been failing, so that the few foot passengers dispersed like shadows in the distance over the wide thoroughfare through the faubourg, were quite invisible to her by the light of the lanterns.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走到这条“死人街”尽头时，她似乎听到身后传来一个男人坚定而沉重的脚步声。好像在以前她也听到过这样的声音。害怕被跟踪的想法使她试图加快步伐，走近明亮的商店窗玻璃，以希望证实一下这个让她心神不宁的疑虑。</td>
		<td class="en">She had passed the end of the Rue des Morts, when she fancied that she could hear the firm, heavy tread of a man walking behind her.Then it seemed to her that she had heard that sound before, and dismayed by the idea of being followed, she tried to walk faster toward a brightly lit shop window, in the hope of verifying the suspicions which had taken hold of her mind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，她一走到路对面射出的光线里就停下了脚步，猛地回头，一下子就看到了雾气里隐隐约约有一个人影。但这个模糊的影像对她来说足够了。在强烈的恐惧之下，她的腿脚突然趔趄了一下，因为她肯定，这个人从她出家门那一刻开始就一路跟着她。接着，想要摆脱这个探子的想法给了她力量。她无法清晰地思考，只能继续前行，速度比之前快了一倍，仿佛这样就能甩掉那个行动比她快得多的男人。她逃了几分钟，最后到了一家糕点商铺。进去之后，她与其说是坐下来的还不说是瘫倒在柜台旁边的那张椅子上。</td>
		<td class="en">So soon as she stood in the shaft of light that streamed out across the road, she turned her head suddenly, and caught sight of a human figure looming through the fog.The dim vision was enough for her.For one moment she reeled beneath an overpowering weight of dread, for she could not doubt any longer that the man had followed her the whole way from her own door; then the desire to escape from the spy gave her strength.Unable to think clearly, she walked twice as fast as before, as if it were possible to escape from a man who of course could move much faster; and for some minutes she fled on, till, reaching a pastry-cook’s shop, she entered and sank rather than sat down upon a chair by the counter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个忙着刺绣的年轻的女人听到门闩发出咔嗒一声，便抬起头来，透过方形的窗玻璃朝外面张望。她似乎认出了那件过时的紫色丝绸斗篷，就立刻走向一个抽屉，好像是要寻找为来者保存的东西。这个女人不仅是动作，就连脸上的表情都很清楚地表明她想尽快摆脱这位不速之客。不过，当她看到抽屉空空如也时，甚至急得惊呼起来。她连看都没看这位老妇人一眼，就急急忙忙离开桌子到商店里间去叫她丈夫，她的丈夫便马上出来了。</td>
		<td class="en">A young woman busy with embroidery looked up from her work at the rattling of the door-latch, and looked out through the square window-panes.She seemed to recognize the old-fashioned violet silk mantle, for she went at once to a drawer as if in search of something put aside for the newcomer.Not only did this movement and the expression of the woman’s face show a very evident desire to be rid as soon as possible of an unwelcome visitor, but she even permitted herself an impatient exclamation when the drawer proved to be empty.Without looking at the lady, she hurried from her desk into the back shop and called to her husband, who appeared at once.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“究竟放哪里了？”她开始很神秘地问，话没说完就朝来客看了一眼。</td>
		<td class="en">“Wherever have you put?—” she began mysteriously, glancing at the customer by way of finishing her question.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >糕点师傅看了一眼老妇人的头饰——那是一顶很大的紫色饰带缠结的黑色丝帽（注：在法国大革命时期，这种服饰被革命的共和派所唾弃，说明老妇人不是共和派）——而后又看了一眼他妻子，似乎在说：“你认为我会把那个东西留在你的抽屉里吗？”接着就离开了。</td>
		<td class="en">The pastry-cook could only see the old lady’s head-dress, a huge black silk bonnet with knots of violet ribbon round it, but he looked at his wife as if to say, “Did you think I should leave such a thing as that lying about in your drawer?” and then vanished.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老妇人如此平静、沉默，以至让店主的妻子感觉很惊讶。　　　　　　　　她走回到老妇人身边，更近地看着她。突然升起了一种怜悯的冲动，其间还掺杂着好奇，这种复杂的感觉在她心里占了上风。老妇人的脸色本来就苍白，看起来像是私下里节衣缩食了。也不难看出，她因为刚才的焦虑，脸色比平时更加苍白了。她的头饰整理得很好，几乎掩盖了她的白头发。毫无疑问是岁月染白了她的头发，因为她的衣服领子上丝毫没有施粉的痕迹。她的服饰极为简洁，这给她的表情增添了一种严峻的神态，她的容貌中也透着傲气和庄重。在以前，不同阶层的人的举止和习惯是很不一样的，贵族能很容易地被辨认出来。店主的妻子确信她的这位来客以前就是位贵族，并且是与宫廷有关系的。</td>
		<td class="en">The old lady kept so still and silent that the shopkeeper’s wife was surprised.She went back to her, and on a nearer view a sudden impulse of pity, blended perhaps with curiosity, got the better of her.The old lady’s face was naturally pale; she looked as though she secretly practiced austerities; but it was easy to see that she was paler than usual from recent agitation of some kind.Her head-dress was so arranged as to almost hide hair that was white, no doubt with age, for there was not a trace of powder on the collar of her dress.The extreme plainness of her dress lent an air of austerity to her face, and her features were proud and grave.The manners and habits of people of condition were so different from those of other classes in former times that a noble was easily known, and the shopkeeper’s wife felt persuaded that her customer was a ci-devant, and that she had been about the Court.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫人。”她不由自主地叫了一声，忘记了这样的称呼是被禁止的。</td>
		<td class="en">“Madame,” she began with involuntary respect, forgetting that the title was proscribed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是这位老妇人没有回答。她只是一动不动地凝视着商店的玻璃窗，仿佛是什么可怕的东西显现在窗玻璃上了。这时，糕点师傅回来了。他拿出一个用蓝色纸包裹的硬纸盒，这才把这位老妇人从沉思中拉了回来。</td>
		<td class="en">But the old lady made no answer.She was staring fixedly at the shop windows as though some dreadful thing had taken shape against the panes.The pastry-cook came back at that moment, and drew the lady from her musings, by holding out a little cardboard box wrapped in blue paper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么了，公民？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is the matter, citoyenne?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没什么，没什么，我的朋友们。”她用柔和的嗓音答道。她边说边抬起头来看着糕点师傅，像是用这一瞥表示对他的感谢。但当她看见他头上的红帽子时，突然大叫了一声。（注：红帽子在法国大革命中是共和派的象征）“啊！你们背叛了我！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nothing, nothing, my friends,” she answered, in a gentle voice.She looked up at the man as she spoke, as if to thank him by a glance; but she saw the red cap on his head, and a cry broke from her.“Ah!YOU have betrayed me!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个男人和他年轻的妻子气愤地做了一个手势来回应她，这让老妇人的脸一下子变红了；她或许是觉得放心了，又或许是为自己无端的怀疑而脸红了。</td>
		<td class="en">The man and his young wife replied by an indignant gesture, that brought the color to the old lady’s face; perhaps she felt relief, perhaps she blushed for her suspicions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“原谅我吧！”她带着孩童般甜美的语气说道。之后，她从口袋里取出一个金路易交给糕点师傅。“这是我们说好的价钱。”她补充道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Forgive me!” she said, with a childlike sweetness in her tones.Then, drawing a gold louis from her pocket, she held it out to the pastry-cook.“That is the price agreed upon,” she added.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一种需求是只有知道需求的人才能本能地感知到的。这个男人和他的妻子相互看看对方，接着又看看他们面前的这位老妇人，在彼此的眼里读到的是同一个想法：那个金路易显然是老妇人最后一点钱了。当老妇人把钱递出去的时候，她的手在微微发抖。她有点伤感，但是很情愿地看着金币，她知道这番付出的程度。饥饿和贫穷在她脸上刻下的皱纹如同苦难和恐惧留在她脸上的痕迹一样显而易见。她的衣服上还留有过去光辉的痕迹。她穿的是旧丝绸做的、陈旧却整洁的披风，上面缝有精致的花边——总之，之前华丽的衣服现在变成褴褛的衣衫了。店主人和他的妻子在怜悯和利己之心之间徘徊不定，他们开始说话来慰藉自己的良心：</td>
		<td class="en">There is a kind of want that is felt instinctively by those who know want.The man and his wife looked at one another, then at the elderly woman before them, and read the same thoughts in each other’s eyes.That bit of gold was so plainly the last.Her hands shook a little as she held it out, looking at it sadly but ungrudgingly, as one who knows the full extent of the sacrifice.Hunger and penury had carved lines as easy to read in her face as the traces of asceticism and fear.There were vestiges of bygone splendor in her clothes.She was dressed in threadbare silk, a neat but well-worn mantle, and daintily mended lace,—in the rags of former grandeur, in short.The shopkeeper and his wife, drawn two ways by pity and self-interest, began by lulling their consciences with words.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“公民，你看上去气色很不好——”</td>
		<td class="en">“You seem very poorly, citoyenne—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“或许夫人想来点什么。”妻子打断他的话。</td>
		<td class="en">“Perhaps madame might like to take something,” the wife broke in.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们有些不错的肉汤。”糕点师傅又说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“We have some very nice broth,” added the pastry-cook.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天那么冷，”妻子继续说道，“你大概在来的路上受了风寒，夫人。但是你可以在这里歇歇，让自己暖和一点。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And it is so cold,” continued his wife; “perhaps you have caught a chill, madame, on your way here.But you can rest and warm yourself a bit.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们可不是魔鬼般黑心肠！”这个男人大声说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“We are not so black as the devil!” cried the man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这对仁厚夫妇充满善意的话和语气赢得了老妇人的信任。她对他们说，有个陌生男人跟在她后面，她害怕一个人回家。</td>
		<td class="en">The kindly intention in the words and tones of the charitable couple won the old lady’s confidence.She said that a strange man had been following her, and she was afraid to go home alone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“原来如此！”带红帽子的店主回答道，“公民，等我一下！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Is that all!” returned he of the red bonnet; “wait for me, citoyenne.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把金币交给妻子。当一个商人用价值不高的商品换来了很高的报酬时，有时一个想法会悄悄进入他的大脑，即想对这些报酬做些适当回报。在这种心理的驱使下，他走出去穿上国民自卫军制服。他拿起他的帽子，扣紧他的弯刀，全副武装地出来了。但是与此同时，他的妻子考虑了一下，和以往一样，这番考虑让她那出自善心而打开的手又合了起来。她感到害怕、不安，唯恐她的丈夫被牵扯到不愉快的事情里。她试图抓住他衣服的边缘，把他拽回来。但是在妻子阻止他之前，他这个好人顺从了自己仁慈的第一想法，主动提出要护送这位老妇人回家。</td>
		<td class="en">He handed the gold coin to his wife, and then went out to put on his National Guard’s uniform, impelled thereto by the idea of making some adequate return for the money; an idea that sometimes slips into a tradesman’s head when he has been prodigiously overpaid for goods of no great value.He took up his cap, buckled on his saber, and came out in full dress.But his wife had had time to reflect, and reflection, as not unfrequently happens, closed the hand that kindly intentions had opened.Feeling frightened and uneasy lest her husband might be drawn into something unpleasant, she tried to catch at the skirt of his coat, to hold him back, but he, good soul, obeying his charitable first thought, brought out his offer to see the lady home, before his wife could stop him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看起来，那个让公民害怕的人仍在店铺周围徘徊。”她尖叫道。</td>
		<td class="en">“The man of whom the citoyenne is afraid is still prowling about the shop, it seems,” she said sharply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也是这么认为的。”老妇人无辜地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am afraid so,” said the lady innocently.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要是探子怎么办？是阴谋？别去！还是把那盒东西从她那里要回来——”</td>
		<td class="en">“How if it is a spy?...a plot?...Don’t go.And take the box away from her—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女人在糕点师傅耳边嘀咕的话使他那阵充满勇气的热忱降到了冰点。</td>
		<td class="en">The words whispered in the pastry-cook’s ear cooled his hot fit of courage down to zero.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦！那我就出去说一两句话。我会让你很快就摆脱他的。”他在冲出商店时大声说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh! I will just go out and say a word or two.I will rid you of him soon enough,” he exclaimed, as he bounced out of the shop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，老妇人像个孩子一样被动地坐回到椅子上，神情几近茫然。但正直的糕点师傅很快就回来了。他原本面色就红润，经屋里炉火烘烤变得更红了，此时却猛地变白了。他是如此恐惧，心慌得连走路都蹒跚起来，还像个醉汉似的瞪着眼睛四下张望。</td>
		<td class="en">The old lady meanwhile, passive as a child and almost dazed, sat down on her chair again.But the honest pastry-cook came back directly.A countenance red enough to begin with, and further flushed by the bake-house fire, was suddenly blanched; such terror perturbed him that he reeled as he walked, and stared about him like a drunken man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可恶的贵族！你想让我们掉脑袋吗？”他怒喊道，“你赶快抬脚走人，永远别再出现在这里。别为了你们的阴谋所需而到我这里来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Miserable aristocrat!Do you want to have our heads cut off?” he shouted furiously.“You just take to your heels and never show yourself here again.Don’t come to me for materials for your plots.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说话的同时，他试图把老妇人已经放进口袋里的小盒子抢走。但是在他世俗的手刚刚碰到她的衣服时，老妇人一瞬间恢复了朝气和活力。虽然除了天主就没了保护者，她宁可面对大街上的危险，也不愿失去刚刚买来的东西。她冲向大门，并迅速把门打开，接着就不见人影了，只剩下这对惊讶的夫妇在吓得发抖。</td>
		<td class="en">He tried, as he spoke, to take away the little box which she had slipped into one of her pockets.But at the touch of a profane hand on her clothes, the stranger recovered youth and activity for a moment, preferring to face the dangers of the street with no protector save God, to the loss of the thing she had just paid for.She sprang to the door, flung it open, and disappeared, leaving the husband and wife dumfounded and quaking with fright.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一来到外面大街上，她就加快了脚步，但是很快就没力气了。当听到积雪在沉重的脚步的踩踏下发出嘎吱作响的声音时，她知道那个无情的探子就紧跟在她后面。她不得不停下来。同样，他也停了下来。由于十分害怕，抑或是想不到办法，她不敢说话也不敢看他。她放慢速度继续走着，这个人也放慢速度跟在后面，那样就可以让她一直在他的视线范围之内。他几乎成了她的影子。</td>
		<td class="en">Once outside in the street, she started away at a quick walk; but her strength soon failed her.She heard the sound of the snow crunching under a heavy step, and knew that the pitiless spy was on her track.She was obliged to stop.He stopped likewise.From sheer terror, or lack of intelligence, she did not dare to speak or to look at him.She went slowly on; the man slackened his pace and fell behind so that he could still keep her in sight.He might have been her very shadow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当这个一直默不作声的男人和这位老妇人再次经过圣洛朗教堂时，九点的钟声刚好敲响。理所当然地，即便是最脆弱的人，在强烈的波动之后也会归于平静。因为，感觉是无限的，我们的感知力却是有限的。这位陌生的妇人遇到的这位假想的迫害者至此都没有加害于她，因此，她试着把他看成是渴望保护她的一位不相识的朋友。她把陌生人出现的情形都想了个遍，并放到一起，像是为这个让人宽慰的理由找些依据，并且宁可相信他是一番好心而无恶意。</td>
		<td class="en">Nine o’clock struck as the silent man and woman passed again by the Church of Saint Laurent.It is in the nature of things that calm must succeed to violent agitation, even in the weakest soul; for if feeling is infinite, our capacity to feel is limited.So, as the stranger lady met with no harm from her supposed persecutor, she tried to look upon him as an unknown friend anxious to protect her.She thought of all the circumstances in which the stranger had appeared, and put them together, as if to find some ground for this comforting theory, and felt inclined to credit him with good intentions rather than bad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老妇人忘记了她带给糕点师傅的恐慌，步伐更加坚定地走过圣马丁郊区的高地。她又花了半个小时走到了一所房子跟前。这所房子位于自主干道拐角通往庞丹门的路口。直到现在，这个地方还是巴黎少有人去的地方之一。北风掠过比特·绍蒙和贝尔维尔，从这里的房屋（不如说是茅草屋）间呼啸而过。这些房屋散布四周，那里几乎是无人居住的废墟，栏杆都是用泥土和动物的骨头堆砌而成的。这里一片荒凉，但却是绝望和苦难之人绝佳避难所。</td>
		<td class="en">Forgetting the fright that he had given the pastry-cook, she walked on with a firmer step through the upper end of the Faubourg Saint Martin; and another half-hour’s walk brought her to a house at the corner where the road to the Barriere de Pantin turns off from the main thoroughfare.Even at this day, the place is one of the least frequented parts of Paris.The north wind sweeps over the Buttes-Chaumont and Belleville, and whistles through the houses (the hovels rather), scattered over an almost uninhabited low-lying waste, where the fences are heaps of earth and bones.It was a desolate-looking place, a fitting refuge for despair and misery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位可怜的妇女竟敢独自在这些寂静的街道中夜行；那个不停追踪她的人面对眼前荒凉的景象也心有余悸。他站在那里沉思，从姿势看起来，他有些犹豫。街灯发出的昏暗的光芒透过夜雾闪烁着，老妇人可以模模糊糊地看见他了。因为恐惧，她的眼睛变得敏锐了。她看见，或者她觉得她看见了这个陌生人的容貌有些凶恶。她刚才的恐惧又被唤醒了。趁着那个人犹豫不决的功夫，她悄悄地从暗处溜到一座幽静的房子门前，按了一下弹簧栓，很快就像幽灵般地消失了。</td>
		<td class="en">The sight of it appeared to make an impression upon the relentless pursuer of a poor creature so daring as to walk alone at night through the silent streets.He stood in thought, and seemed by his attitude to hesitate.She could see him dimly now, under the street lamp that sent a faint, flickering light through the fog.Fear gave her eyes.She saw, or thought she saw, something sinister about the stranger’s features.Her old terrors awoke; she took advantage of a kind of hesitation on his part, slipped through the shadows to the door of the solitary house, pressed a spring, and vanished swiftly as a phantom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个陌生人纹丝不动地站了一会儿，抬头凝视着这座房子。这是圣马丁郊区的一种略显破旧、摇摇欲坠、不宜居住的小屋。它是用粗糙的石头修建成的，外面用黄色的泥灰涂抹了，还有巨大的裂缝，看起来好像被微风一吹就会倒塌一般。屋顶全是长满苔藓的褐色瓦片。有几处缺了几片瓦，看起来像是遭受积雪重压而造成的。每层楼有三扇窗户，窗框由于受潮已经腐坏，由于日晒已经发卷。很显然，这样的房子是挡不住寒冷的。这座房子很孤单地立在那里，看起来像是一座时间忘记摧毁了的旧式塔楼。微弱的光线从阁楼顶的窗户长短不一地穿透进来，若非这束光线，整个建筑将处于黑暗之中。</td>
		<td class="en">For awhile the stranger stood motionless, gazing up at the house.It was in some sort a type of the wretched dwellings in the suburb; a tumble-down hovel, built of rough stones, daubed over with a coat of yellowish stucco, and so riven with great cracks that there seemed to be danger lest the slightest puff of wind might blow it down.The roof, covered with brown moss-grown tiles, had given way in several places, and looked as though it might break down altogether under the weight of the snow.The frames of the three windows on each story were rotten with damp and warped by the sun; evidently the cold must find its way inside.The house standing thus quite by itself looked like some old tower that Time had forgotten to destroy.A faint light shone from the attic windows pierced at irregular distances in the roof; otherwise the whole building was in total darkness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，老妇人借助旁边的一根绳子作扶手，艰难地爬上那粗糙、修得也不漂亮的楼梯。在阁楼房间门前她停了下来，神秘地叩了叩门；一位老人开了门并给她挪过来一把椅子。她立刻跌坐了进去。</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile the old lady climbed not without difficulty up the rough, clumsily built staircase, with a rope by way of a hand-rail.At the door of the lodging in the attic she stopped and tapped mysteriously; an old man brought forward a chair for her.She dropped into it at once.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“藏起来！藏起来！”她抬头看着他喊道，“虽然我们很少离开这座房子，但我们所有的行踪还是被察觉了，每一步都被监视着——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hide! hide!” she exclaimed, looking up at him.“Seldom as we leave the house, everything that we do is known, and every step is watched—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在怎么办？”另外一位坐在火炉旁的老妇人问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is it now?” asked another elderly woman, sitting by the fire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那个昨天到今天一直在房子周围徘徊的人，今天晚上盯上我了——”</td>
		<td class="en">“The man that has been prowling about the house yesterday and today, followed me tonight—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这番话让三个住在这个糟糕不堪的小屋里的人面面相觑。他们丝毫没有掩饰所感到的深深的恐惧。年老的神父最清醒，这可能是因为他面临的危险最大。在某种程度上，勇敢的人面对迫害带来的浩劫或枷锁时，是会担起重负的。可以说，他会在一开始就牺牲自我，这样之后他生命的每一天就变成了从命运手里夺来的又一次胜利。但从两位老妇人看他的神态中不难看出，她们为他感到忧虑不安。</td>
		<td class="en">At those words all three dwellers in the wretched den looked in each other’s faces and did not try to dissimulate the profound dread that they felt.The old priest was the least overcome, probably because he ran the greatest danger.If a brave man is weighed down by great calamities or the yoke of persecution, he begins, as it were, by making the sacrifice of himself; and thereafter every day of his life becomes one more victory snatched from fate.But from the way in which the women looked at him it was easy to see that their intense anxiety was on his account.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么我们对天主的信心反使我们失望了呢，我的姊妹？”他声调很低却很诚恳地说道，“在圣衣会的杀戮者和受害人的尖叫中，我们还为天主唱颂歌了。我能从那场屠杀中重获新生，这应该是天主的旨意。没错，一定是的，因为我要活着来经历某种我必须一声不吭地去忍受的命运。天主会保护他的子民，会按照他的意愿来对待他们。我们必须为你们，而不是为我着想。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why should our faith in God fail us, my sisters?” he said, in low but fervent tones.“We sang His praises through the shrieks of murderers and their victims at the Carmelites.If it was His will that I should come alive out of that butchery, it was, no doubt, because I was reserved for some fate which I am bound to endure without murmuring.God will protect His own; He can do with them according to His will.It is for you, not for me that we must think.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不！”其中一个修女回答道，“和神父相比，我们的生命又算什么呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” answered one of the women.“What is our life compared to a priest’s life?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“自谢勒修道院出来，我就当自己已经死了。”没有离开过房子的那个修女补充道。这时刚刚回来的那个修女拿出小盒子递给神父。</td>
		<td class="en">“Once outside the Abbaye de Chelles, I look upon myself as dead,” added the nun who had not left the house, while the Sister that had just returned held out the little box to the priest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是圣饼……嘘！我听到有人上楼梯。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here are the wafers... but I can hear some one coming up the stairs.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为墙上挂着的一个巨大的、象牙和黑檀木做的、带着苦像（注：“苦像”指耶稣受难像）十字架十分引人注目，所以原本就空空的墙壁显得更加空空荡荡了。两位修女凑合着用封蜡把四支纤细的祭坛蜡烛固定在祭台上。蜡烛泛出的微弱、惨白的光线几乎都渗入了墙壁，所以房子里的其他地方几乎都处于黑暗之中。但是，这些集中在圣物上的暗淡的光线看起来就像是来自天堂的一线光芒投在了简朴的祭坛上。地面散发出浓烈的湿气。屋里到处都是从裂缝里吹进来的冷风；屋顶两侧都很陡峭，是当时流行的阁楼顶样式。虽然一切都很平淡，但是或许也没有什么比这个令人伤心的丧礼仪式更严肃的了。周围是那么安静，以至于他们都能听见阿尔玛涅路上传来的最细微的声音，寂静给这个夜晚带来一种阴沉的庄严。而仪式十分庄重——与破落的环境一点也不相称——这带来了一种令人敬畏的神圣感。</td>
		<td class="en">The bare walls looked all the barer, because the one thing that hung there was the great ivory and ebony crucifix, which of necessity attracted the eyes.Four slender little altar candles, which the Sisters had contrived to fasten into their places with sealing-wax, gave a faint, pale light, almost absorbed by the walls; the rest of the room lay well-nigh in the dark.But the dim brightness, concentrated upon the holy things, looked like a ray from Heaven shining down upon the unadorned shrine.The floor was reeking with damp.An icy wind swept in through the chinks here and there, in a roof that rose sharply on either side, after the fashion of attic roofs.Nothing could be less imposing; yet perhaps, too, nothing could be more solemn than this mournful ceremony.A silence so deep that they could have heard the faintest sound of a voice on the Route d’Allemagne, invested the nightpiece with a kind of somber majesty; while the grandeur of the service—all the grander for the strong contrast with the poor surroundings—produced a feeling of reverent awe.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The Sisters kneeling on each side of the altar, regardless of the deadly chill from the wet brick floor, were engaged in prayer, while the priest, arrayed in pontifical vestments, brought out a golden chalice set with gems; doubtless one of the sacred vessels saved from the pillage of the Abbaye de Chelles.Beside a ciborium, the gift of royal munificence, the wine and water for the holy sacrifice of the mass stood ready in two glasses such as could scarcely be found in the meanest tavern.For want of a missal, the priest had laid his breviary on the altar, and a common earthenware plate was set for the washing of hands that were pure and undefiled with blood.It was all so infinitely great, yet so little, poverty-stricken yet noble, a mingling of sacred and profane.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >陌生人虔诚地在两位修女中间跪了下来。神父在带着苦像的圣餐杯上系了黑纱，这是因为此外就没有别的办法能体现这场弥撒是一场追思弥撒。这样仿佛天主亲自披上了孝服。陌生人突然注意到这一点，这一发现引起了他排山倒海般的回忆，大滴的汗珠从他宽阔的前额上冒出来。</td>
		<td class="en">The stranger came forward reverently to kneel between the two nuns.But the priest had tied crape round the chalice of the crucifix, having no other way of marking the mass as a funeral service; it was as if God himself had been in mourning.The man suddenly noticed this, and the sight appeared to call up some overwhelming memory, for great drops of sweat stood out on his broad forehead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个场景中的四个沉默的参与者神秘地相互看了看，他们的灵魂竞相跳动、思想相互交流，直到一切都融入了那种充满敬畏和怜悯的感觉。对他们而言，这位受难国王的遗体虽已被生石灰吞噬，却也被他们的切盼唤醒；他的影子已经带着国王所有的一切威严站在了他们中间。他们正在为一个躯体不知在何处的死者举行周年祭。在这木条和瓦片开裂了的地方，四个基督徒正在举行一个没有棺材的葬礼，并把法国国王的灵魂交给他天主手中安息。没有比这更纯粹的忠诚了。这是一种不假思索的、极好的信心之举。当然在天主看来，这就像一杯凉水，抵消了崇高的美德的作用。神父和两位性格脆弱的修女代表了整个君主制度。或许同时，这个陌生人代表着重大的变革，他脸上的悔恨是如此之深，以至于人们不能不想到他正在履行诺言，在进行无边的忏悔。</td>
		<td class="en">Then the four silent actors in the scene looked mysteriously at one another; and their souls in emulation seemed to stir and communicate the thoughts within them until all were melted into one feeling of awe and pity.It seemed to them that the royal martyr whose remains had been consumed with quicklime, had been called up by their yearning and now stood, a shadow in their midst, in all the majesty of a king.They were celebrating an anniversary service for the dead whose body lay elsewhere.Under the disjointed laths and tiles, four Christians were holding a funeral service without a coffin, and putting up prayers to God for the soul of a King of France.No devotion could be purer than this.It was a wonderful act of faith achieved without an afterthought.Surely in the sight of God it was like the cup of cold water which counterbalances the loftiest virtues.The prayers put up by two feeble nuns and a priest represented the whole Monarchy, and possibly at the same time, the Revolution found expression in the stranger, for the remorse in his face was so great that it was impossible not to think that he was fulfilling the vows of a boundless repentance.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When the priest came to the Latin words, Introibo ad altare Dei, a sudden divine inspiration flashed upon him; he looked at the three kneeling figures, the representatives of Christian France, and said instead, as though to blot out the poverty of the garret, “We are about to enter the Sanctuary of God!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >神父说出的这席话极为诚挚，让修女们和这位陌生人感到了神圣的敬畏之情。在罗马圣彼得教堂拱顶下的天主，也不必在这间贫寒的避难所里的基督徒眼中的天主更威严。天主在这里的显现是如此真切，以至于天主和人类灵魂之间交流的媒介都显得多余了，因为天主所有的光辉都是他自己产生的。</td>
		<td class="en">These words, uttered with thrilling earnestness, struck reverent awe into the nuns and the stranger.Under the vaulted roof of St. Peter’s at Rome, God would not have revealed Himself in greater majesty than here for the eyes of the Christians in that poor refuge; so true is it that all intermediaries between God and the soul of man are superfluous, and all the grandeur of God proceeds from Himself alone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >陌生人的热忱是诚挚的。在这次单独的代祷仪式里，天主的四个忠仆和君主交融在同一种情感里。神圣的话语像是天籁之音一般穿过寂静。一时间，陌生人眼里含满了泪水。当他在背诵《天主经》的时候，神父用拉丁文增加了一句：“Et remitte scelus regicidis sicut Ludovicus eis remisit semetips”（注：本句拉丁文指“请宽恕弑君者吧，正像路易十六自己已经宽恕了他们一样”。）他的听众肯定会理解这句祷词——宽恕弑君者的罪，如同路易十六宽恕了他们的罪一样。</td>
		<td class="en">The stranger’s fervor was sincere.One emotion blended the prayers of the four servants of God and the King in a single supplication.The holy words rang like the music of heaven through the silence.At one moment, tears gathered in the stranger’s eyes.This was during the Pater Noster; for the priest added a petition in Latin, and his audience doubtless understood him when he said: “Et remitte scelus regicidis sicut Ludovicus eis remisit semetipse”—forgive the regicides as Louis himself forgave them.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The Sisters saw two great tears trace a channel down the stranger’s manly checks and fall to the floor.Then the office for the dead was recited; the Domine salvum fac regem chanted in an undertone that went to the hearts of the faithful Royalists, for they thought how the child-King for whom they were praying was even then a captive in the hands of his enemies; and a shudder ran through the stranger, as he thought that a new crime might be committed, and that he could not choose but take his part in it.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I should blush to offer remuneration of any kind for the funeral service which you have just performed for the repose of the King’s soul and the relief of my conscience.The only possible return for something of inestimable value is an offering likewise beyond price.Will you deign, monsieur, to take my gift of a holy relic?A day will perhaps come when you will understand its value.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As he spoke the stranger held out a box; it was very small and exceedingly light.The priest took it mechanically, as it were, so astonished was he by the man’s solemn words, the tones of his voice, and the reverence with which he held out the gift.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“This house that you are living in belongs to Mucius Scaevola, the plasterer on the first floor,” he said.“He is well known in the Section for his patriotism, but in reality he is an adherent of the Bourbons.He used to be a huntsman in the service of his Highness the Prince de Conti, and he owes everything to him.So long as you stay in the house, you are safer here than anywhere else in France.Do not go out.Pious souls will minister to your necessities, and you can wait in safety for better times.Next year, on the 21st of January,”—he could not hide an involuntary shudder as he spoke,—“next year, if you are still in this dreary refuge, I will come back again to celebrate the expiatory mass with you—”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Such an adventure possessed all the interest of a romance in the lives of the innocent nuns.So, as soon as the venerable abbe told them the story of the mysterious gift, it was placed upon the table, and by the feeble light of the tallow dip an indescribable curiosity appeared in the three anxious faces.Mademoiselle de Langeais opened the box, and found a very fine lawn handkerchief, soiled with sweat; darker stains appeared as they unfolded it.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快这些失去自由的人就发现，虽然是恐怖时期，却会有一些有力的手伸出来援助他们。开始，他们收到一些木柴和食物，接下来修女们了解到，一位妇女向他们的保护者提了建议，于是就有人送来了一些亚麻布和衣服，这样他们就不必在离开这座房子时，还无奈地穿着之前那些让人注意的贵族服饰了。不久，米修斯·斯凯沃给了她们两张公民卡。也经常会有一些关乎神父安危的消息间接地传到他们这里来。他们觉得这些忠告和建议来得都很及时，只可能来自掌握着国家机密的人。那正是巴黎人民的饥荒时期，可暗中却有人把限量供应的“白面包”送来给那些被囚禁在环境恶劣的阁楼里的修女们。他们猜想，只有米修斯·斯凯沃才是巧妙又不失机智地坚持神秘善举的布施者。</td>
		<td class="en">Before very long the prisoners knew that, in spite of the Terror, some powerful hand was extended over them.It began when they received firewood and provisions; and next the Sisters knew that a woman had lent counsel to their protector, for linen was sent to them, and clothes in which they could leave the house without causing remark upon the aristocrat’s dress that they had been forced to wear.After awhile Mucius Scaevola gave them two civic cards; and often tidings necessary for the priest’s safety came to them in roundabout ways.Warnings and advice reached them so opportunely that they could only have been sent by some person in the possession of state secrets.And, at a time when famine threatened Paris, invisible hands brought rations of “white bread” for the proscribed women in the wretched garret.Still they fancied that Citizen Mucius Scaevola was only the mysterious instrument of a kindness always ingenious, and no less intelligent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >住在阁楼里的高尚的修女们不再怀疑，他们的保护者就是那个在一七九三年一月二十日的夜里突然出现在他们面前要求做赎罪弥撒的陌生人。他们对他迅速产生了一种狂热的崇拜。这个人成了他们唯一的希望，她们靠他的救助而活着。祷告时，他们特意为他加了祷告词。这些虔诚的信徒早晚都为他祈祷，愿他幸福、顺利、平安，乞求天主免除他路上的一切罗网，让他脱离敌人，赐予他长寿、平和的生活。他们带着这样的感激之情日复一日地祈祷，这种情感里还混杂着日渐强烈的好奇心。他们谈论着他第一次突然出现时的情形。他们无尽地猜想着。他们在困境中谈论这些时精神上是愉快的，这也是陌生人给他们带来的另一个好处。他们一遍又一遍地说，当陌生人如他所承诺的那样再次来看她们的时候，一定要举行一个追思路易十六逝世一周年的纪念活动，而他是不会推辞他们这份情谊的。</td>
		<td class="en">The noble ladies in the garret could no longer doubt that their protector was the stranger of the expiatory mass on the night of the 22nd of January, 1793; and a kind of cult of him sprung up among them.Their one hope was in him; they lived through him.They added special petitions for him to their prayers; night and morning the pious souls prayed for his happiness, his prosperity, his safety; entreating God to remove all snares far from his path, to deliver him from his enemies, to grant him a long and peaceful life.And with this daily renewed gratitude, as it may be called, there blended a feeling of curiosity which grew more lively day by day.They talked over the circumstances of his first sudden appearance, their conjectures were endless; the stranger had conferred one more benefit upon them by diverting their minds.Again, and again, they said, when he next came to see them as he promised, to celebrate the sad anniversary of the death of Louis XVI., he could not escape their friendship.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >让人如此急切盼望的这个夜晚终于来了。午夜时分，陈旧的木楼梯上响起了陌生人沉重的脚步声。他们为了他的到来把房间布置到最好，祭坛也已准备好了。这次房门是开着的，两位修女站在楼梯口，想要为来者照亮进来的路。德朗热小姐甚至走下几步楼梯，想要更快地见到他们的恩人。</td>
		<td class="en">The night so impatiently awaited came at last.At midnight the old wooden staircase echoed with the stranger’s heavy footsteps.They had made the best of their room for his coming; the altar was ready, and this time the door stood open, and the two Sisters were out at the stairhead, eager to light the way.Mademoiselle de Langeais even came down a few steps, to meet their benefactor the sooner.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他抬起头，冷冷地看了她一眼，没有作答。修女感觉像是有一件冰冷的披风盖在了自己身上，于是就没有再说什么了。他们见到他时，开始还怀着强烈的感激之情和好奇之心，而此刻这些都在他们心里逐渐消失了。或许他没有那么冷酷，没有那么不爱说话，没有他们看到的那么严肃，只是因为他们本来带着兴奋地心情准备向他倾述友情，而看到他这样，转而有些失落罢了。但是三个贫穷的、被夺去自由的人明白，他这是想让他们把他当做陌生人来对待，他们也只能照做了。神父察觉到，在陌生人看见他们为他的来访所做的准备时，他的唇角露出一丝微笑，但一瞬间又抑制住了。他听了弥撒，做了祷告，之后就离开了。德朗热小姐邀请他一起吃些为他准备的点心，他也以几句礼貌的话谢绝了。</td>
		<td class="en">He raised his face, gave her a dark look, and made no answer.The sister felt as if an icy mantle had fallen over her, and said no more.At the sight of him, the glow of gratitude and curiosity died away in their hearts.Perhaps he was not so cold, not so taciturn, not so stern as he seemed to them, for in their highly wrought mood they were ready to pour out their feeling of friendship.But the three poor prisoners understood that he wished to be a stranger to them; and submitted.The priest fancied that he saw a smile on the man’s lips as he saw their preparations for his visit, but it was at once repressed.He heard mass, said his prayer, and then disappeared, declining, with a few polite words, Mademoiselle de Langeais’ invitation to partake of the little collation made ready for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >热月九日之后，修女们和德马罗勒神父可以在巴黎街上毫无危险地随处走动了。神父第一次出门去了一家叫“玫瑰皇后”的香料店，这家店是拉贡公民和他的妻子开的，他们是宫廷香料商。拉贡坚定地拥护保皇派立场；旺代省的保皇党领袖就是通过他们与王室以及巴黎的保皇派取得联系的。神父穿着当时普通的衣服，站在商店的入口处——商店在圣罗克街和投石党人街中间。这时他看见圣奥诺雷街挤满了人，堵得他没法出去了。</td>
		<td class="en">After the 9th Thermidor, the Sisters and the Abbe de Marolles could go about Paris without the least danger.The first time that the abbe went out he walked to a perfumer’s shop at the sign of The Queen of Roses, kept by the Citizen Ragon and his wife, court perfumers.The Ragons had been faithful adherents of the Royalist cause; it was through their means that the Vendean leaders kept up a correspondence with the Princes and the Royalist Committee in Paris.The abbe, in the ordinary dress of the time, was standing on the threshold of the shop—which stood between Saint Roch and the Rue des Frondeurs—when he saw that the Rue Saint Honore was filled with a crowd and he could not go out.</td></tr>
