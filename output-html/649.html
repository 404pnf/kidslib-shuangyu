		<td class="en">Chapter 1 Mr. sherlock Holmes</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一八七八年，我拿到了伦敦大学的医学博士学位，接着就到内特雷医院[^2]去进修军医课程。课程刚刚修完，我就奉命前往诺森伯兰第五燧发枪团，充当该团的军医助理。那个团当时驻扎在印度，可我人还没到，第二次阿富汗战争[^3]就打了起来。在孟买下船的时候，我听说我那个团已经穿越重重关隘，挺进到了敌境深处。即便如此，我还是和许多处境相似的军官一起跟了上去，并且安全地抵达了坎大哈[^4]。我在那里找到了自己的团队，立刻就投入了新的工作。许多人都通过这场战争取得了荣誉和升迁，我的收获却只是霉运和灾难。当时我奉命转入伯克郡步兵团，跟那支部队一起参加了伤亡惨重的迈万德战役[^5]。</td>
		<td class="en">In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >战役当中，我肩上中了一颗捷泽尔[^6]枪弹，肩胛骨被打碎，锁骨下方的动脉也擦伤了。多亏了勤务兵穆雷的忠诚和勇气，我才没有落到回教士兵的手里。他把受伤的我扔到一匹驮马的背上，带着我安全地回到了英军的阵地。</td>
		<td class="en">The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >创痛令我形销骨立，长期的艰苦生活又令我虚弱不堪，于是他们就让我离开战场，跟一大群伤员一起去了白沙瓦[^7]的后方医院。我在那里休养生息，到后来已经能够在病床周围走动走动，甚至能够到阳台上去晒晒太阳了。就在那时，我又遭遇了印度殖民地为我们特备的那种诅咒，染上了伤寒。几个月的时间里，我一直都是命悬一线。等到我终于恢复神智、开始痊愈的时候，我已经虚弱憔悴得不成样子，以致医生们决定立刻打发我回英格兰，一天也不能耽搁。就这样，我被他们遣送回国，坐上了“奥伦蒂斯号”运兵船。一个月之后，我在朴茨茅斯[^8]码头上了岸，健康已经遭受了无法挽回的损害。还好，爱民如子的政府准了我九个月的假期，好让我调养身体。</td>
		<td class="en">Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the veranda, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在英格兰无亲无故，因此就拥有空气一般的自由——换句话说，拥有一个每天收入十一先令零六便士[^9]的人所能拥有的最大自由。既然如此，我便顺理成章地选择了伦敦，因为它好比是一个巨大的污水池，大英帝国境内所有的游民懒汉都会不由自主地流到那里去。我在斯特兰街[^10]的一家出租公寓里住了一段时间，过着一种苦闷无聊的生活，而且大手大脚地花钱，远远超过了应有的限度。到后来，我的经济状况恶化到了让人恐慌的地步，以致我很快就意识到，我要么选择离开伦敦、到乡下去过日子，要么就得彻底改变自己的生活方式。我选择了后一种办法，第一步便是打定主意，要离开那家公寓，另找一个不那么浮华也不那么昂贵的住处。</td>
		<td class="en">I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在作出上述决定的当天，我站在克莱蒂伦酒吧的门前，有人拍了拍我的肩膀。我转过头去，看见了年轻的斯坦福德，他是我在巴茨医院[^11]求学时的一个助手。能在伦敦这样的汪洋大海当中看到一张友善的脸庞，对一个孤苦伶仃的人来说实在是一件值得高兴的事情。照过去的情况来说，斯坦福德和我并没有什么特别的交情，眼下呢，我却兴高采烈地跟他打起了招呼，而他也是一副很高兴看到我的样子。兴奋之余，我便邀请他跟我一起去霍尔伯恩饭店吃午饭。再下来，我们就坐上马车出发了。</td>
		<td class="en">On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when someone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“华生，这阵子你都在干什么呢？”马车辚辚地碾过拥挤的伦敦街道，斯坦福德突然问我，丝毫不掩饰自己的诧异。“看你瘦得像把柴禾，脸也黄得跟蜡一样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. “You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我大致说了说自己的经历，还没来得及说完，目的地已经到了。</td>
		<td class="en">I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真够倒霉的！”听完了我的种种不幸遭遇，他满怀同情地说道。“眼下你有什么打算呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. “What are you up to now?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我在找住处，”我回答道。“想看看这地方究竟有没有条件舒适、价钱也合理的房子。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怪事，”我的同伴说道，“你这种说法，今天我已经是第二次听到了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man today that has used that expression to me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“第一次是听谁说的呢？”我问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“And who was the first?” I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一个在医院实验室工作的家伙说的。今天早上他还在唉声叹气，说他找到了一处相当不错的房子，只可惜负担不起房租，又找不到人来跟自己分摊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的天！”我叫道，“要是他真想找人合租房子的话，找我就再合适不过了。我喜欢有个伴儿，比一个人住强。”</td>
		<td class="en">“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >斯坦福德端着酒杯，惊讶不已地看了看我。“你这么说，是因为你还不了解歇洛克·福尔摩斯这个人，”他说道，“兴许，你不会愿意与他长期为伴。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass. “You don’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么，他有什么毛病吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, what is there against him?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，我并不是说他有毛病。他只是想法有点儿古怪，对某种科学特别热衷。据我所知，他为人还是相当正派的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是个医科学生，对吧？”我说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是——我不知道他到底想研究什么。按我看，他对解剖学很是在行，还是个第一流的药剂师。不过，据我所知，他从来也没有接受过系统的医学训练。他搞的都是些杂七杂八、古里古怪的研究，但却积累了一大堆非常冷门的知识，能把他的教授们吓一大跳。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the-way knowledge which would astonish his professors.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“难道你从来没问过他到底在研究什么吗？”我问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没问过。他这个人不会轻易吐露心事。话说回来，兴致来了的时候，他也是满健谈的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想跟他见个面，”我说道。“如果要跟人合住的话，我倒希望对方是个勤勉好学、性格安静的人。我这个人不够强壮，承受不了太多噪音和刺激。那两样东西，我在阿富汗的时候就已经受够了，这辈子也不想再受。我怎么才能见到你这位朋友呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他这会儿肯定是在实验室里，”我的同伴回答道。“他要么是连着几个星期都不上那里去，要么就在那里没日没夜地工作。你要愿意的话，午饭之后我们可以一起去找他。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好的，”我满口应承。接下来，我们就聊起了别的一些事情。</td>
		<td class="en">“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从霍尔伯恩饭店去医院的路上，斯坦福德又跟我谈起了我打算引为室友的这位先生，对他的脾性作了几点补充说明。</td>
		<td class="en">As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要是跟他合不来，你可不能怪我，”他说道，“我只是偶尔会在实验室里碰到他，对他的了解就这么多。你自己提议要跟他合住，到时可不能让我来负这个责任。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“合不来的话，分开也很容易，”我回答道。“照我看，斯坦福德，”我紧盯着我的同伴，补了一句，“你这么急着撇清自己，一定是有什么缘由。是因为这家伙的脾气太火爆吗，还是有什么别的问题呢？你就跟我直说了吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It seems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这事情本来就说不清，要说清当然不太容易，”他笑着答道。“按我的标准来看，福尔摩斯这个人有点儿太讲科学，几乎达到了冷血的地步。要我说，他完全可能会拿一小撮最新提炼的植物碱去给他的朋友尝尝，倒不是有什么恶意，你明白吧，纯粹是出于一种探索精神，想要对它的效果有一个精确的认识。说句公道话，我觉得，让他自己去尝他也一样心甘情愿。看情形，他是对准确无误的知识有一种热情。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这也没什么不对啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Very right too.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是没什么不对，只是有可能发展到过火的程度。要是这种热情表现为在解剖室里用棍子击打尸体的话，显然会让人觉得相当不可理喻。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“击打尸体！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Beating the subjects!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，因为他想要知道，死后所受的瘀伤可以达到什么程度。我亲眼见过他这么干。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不是说他学的不是医科吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“的确不是，鬼才知道他学的是什么东西。来都来了，你还是自己去了解他这个人吧。”说话间，我们转进一条狭窄的巷子，穿过了一道小小的侧门，门里面就是那座大医院的配楼。这地方我很熟悉，用不着他来指引，于是我们攀上灰白的石头台阶，沿着长长的走廊往前走。走廊的墙壁刷得雪白，两边是一道道暗褐色的门。靠近走廊远端的地方分出了一段低矮的拱形通道，通道的尽头就是化学实验室。</td>
		<td class="en">“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >化学实验室的天花板很高，房间里有数不清的瓶子，有的排得整整齐齐，也有的摆得乱七八糟。地板上散放着几张宽大的矮桌，桌上摆满了曲颈甑和试管，还有几盏蓝焰荧荧的本生灯[^12]。实验室里只有一名学生，此时正站在远处的一张桌子旁边，弓着背专心致志地工作。听到我们的脚步声，他回过头瞥了一眼，跟着就欢呼一声，跳了起来。“我找到了！找到了，”他一边冲我的同伴叫喊，一边朝我们这边跑了过来，手里拿着一支试管。“我找到了一种试剂，只有血红素能让它沉淀，其他东西都不能。”即便是找到了一座金矿，他脸上的表情也不会比此刻更为欣喜。</td>
		<td class="en">This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve found it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这位是华生医生，这位是歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生，”斯坦福德给我俩作了个介绍。</td>
		<td class="en">“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您好，”他诚恳地问候了一声，紧紧地握住了我的手，力气大得让我不敢相信。“依我看，您应该在阿富汗待过。”</td>
		<td class="en">“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这您是怎么看出来的呢？”我惊讶万分地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别管了，”他吃吃地笑了笑。“现在的话题是血红素。我这个发现的重大意义，您想必已经看出来了吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “ The question now is about haemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从化学的角度来说，这当然很有趣，”我回答道，“从实用的角度来说呢——”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but practically—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，伙计，这可是多年以来最具有实用价值的一个法医学发现啊。有了它，我们就能准确无误地鉴定血渍，您不会看不出来吧。过来瞧瞧！”情急之下，他抓住我外套的袖子，把我拽到了他刚才工作的那张桌子旁边。“咱们先弄点新鲜的血液，”他一边说，一边用一根长针扎破了自己的手指，再用一支化学吸管从手指上吸了滴血。“好了，现在我把这一点点血滴到一公升的水里。您看，混合之后的液体跟纯净的水没什么两样，血和水的比例应该不超过一比一百万。不过，我敢肯定，咱们还是能够制造出那种特殊的化学反应。”他一边说，一边往盛水的玻璃罐里扔了几粒白色的结晶，然后又加了几滴透明的液体。转眼之间，玻璃罐里的液体变成了暗红色，罐子的底部也出现了褐色的粉状沉淀。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us have some fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. “Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈！哈！”他一边欢呼一边拍手，高兴得像个刚拿到新玩具的孩子。“您觉得怎么样？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个实验似乎挺精密的，”我如是评论。</td>
		<td class="en">“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您得说是精妙！精妙！以前那种愈创木鉴定法[^13]非常笨拙，鉴定的结果也不准确。用显微镜寻找血细胞的方法也好不到哪里去。如果要检验几个钟头之前留下的陈旧血渍，后一种方法就起不了任何作用。反过来，我这种方法似乎始终有效，血液新不新鲜都是一样。世上有千百个逍遥法外的罪人，要是以前就有这种方法的话，那些人早就已经为他们的罪行付出代价了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Beautiful! beautiful! The old guaiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真是就好！”我咕哝了一句。</td>
		<td class="en">“Indeed!” I murmured.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一直以来，这都是处理刑事案件的一个关键。有些时候，警方可能会在罪案发生之后几个月才找到一个嫌犯。他们检查了此人的衬衫或者其他衣物，发现上面有褐色的污渍。这些污渍究竟是血渍、是泥斑、是锈迹、是果汁的痕迹，还是别的什么东西呢？这个问题让许多专家束手无策，原因又在哪里呢？原因就是没有可靠的鉴定方法。如今我们有了歇洛克·福尔摩斯鉴定法，这个难题就不复存在了。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他说话的时候两眼放光，还把一只手捂在心脏部位，身子微欠，似乎是在向想象之中的一些喝彩听众鞠躬致意。</td>
		<td class="en">His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真是个值得庆贺的发现哩，”我说道。他这股兴奋劲儿让我惊诧不已。</td>
		<td class="en">“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去年，法兰克福出了个冯·比绍夫案件。倘若当时就有这种方法，他一定已经上了绞架。此外还有布拉德福德的梅森、臭名昭著的穆勒、蒙彼利埃的勒弗雷，以及新奥尔良的萨姆森[^14]。可以用这种方法来断案的例子，我可以举出整整二十个。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你简直是本记录罪案的活日历，”斯坦福德笑着说。“我建议你用这些材料来办张报纸，名字就叫‘警界旧闻’好了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a laugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News of the Past.’”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，读起来没准儿还很有趣哩，”歇洛克·福尔摩斯一边回应，一边用一小块橡皮膏贴住了手指上的针眼。“我必须多加小心，”他接着说道，转头冲我微微一笑，“因为我经常都要跟有毒的药品打交道。”说这话的时候，他把手伸了出来。于是我发现，他那只手不光贴满了大小相似的橡皮膏，还被强酸腐蚀得变了色。</td>
		<td class="en">“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. “I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们来这里是有事情的，”斯坦福德一边说，一边坐上了一张高高的三脚凳，还把另一张凳子朝我这边踢了踢。“我这位朋友想找个住处，而你又抱怨自己找不到分摊房租的伙伴，所以呢，我就想把你们俩撮合到一起。”看样子，歇洛克·福尔摩斯似乎很高兴跟我合住。“我看中了贝克街[^15]上的一套房子，”他说道，“咱俩住特别合适。要我说，您应该不介意浓烈的烟草味道吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.” Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would suit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?”</td></tr>

It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.</td></tr>

His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision.

My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence.

Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me.

Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.

That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s *Lieder*, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his armchair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine.

One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bedroom. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I have to use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these people are my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point-blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me.

The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我本来以为歇洛克·福尔摩斯会火急火燎地冲进房子，一头扎进这宗谜案，他的打算却似乎跟我的想法完全不沾边。带着一种漫不经心的神情，他在人行道上踱来踱去，茫然地扫视着地面、天空和街对面的房子，还有围墙顶上的栅栏。考虑到眼下的情形，我真觉得他这种架势有点儿做作。勘查完了之后，他慢慢地沿着花园小径往前走，准确说应该是沿着小径边上的草丛往前走，眼睛死死地盯着地面。中间他停了两次，其中一次我还看见他笑了一笑，听见他满意地欢呼了一声。潮湿的粘土地面的确留着很多脚印，可是，既然那些警察曾经在这里来来往往，我实在想不出我同伴还能从地面找到些什么。话虽然这么说，鉴于我对他敏锐的观察力有过异常深刻的体会，我还是确信，他能够看到很多我看不到的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle.

		<td class="en">All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.</td></tr>

As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope.

		<td class="en">“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to the two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a fourwheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the fingernails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other thing, Lestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “ ‘Rache,’ is the German for ‘revenge’; so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”</td></tr>
