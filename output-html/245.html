		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >英国学校的女教师从学校大门口走了下来，她没有像往常一样朝左拐，而是朝右边走去。现在是四点差五分，两个一起匆匆赶回家给丈夫准备晚饭的妇女突然停下来看着她。她们站在那儿盯着她看了好一会儿，然后彼此瞟了一眼对方，做着女人特有的鬼脸。</td>
		<td class="en">The mistress of the British School stepped down from her school gate, and instead of turning to the left as usual, she turned to the right.Two women who were hastening home to scramble their husbands’ dinners together—it was five minutes to four—stopped to look at her.They stood gazing after her for a moment; then they glanced at each other with a woman’s little grimace.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >毫无疑问，她远去的背影是滑稽可笑的：又瘦又小，戴着一顶黑色的草帽，穿着一件红褐色的开士米上衣，将整个裙子都罩住了。对于这么一个又瘦又小、弱不禁风、举止迟钝的人而言，她那缓悠悠、不慌不忙的步伐也是可笑的。希尔达·罗博特姆还不到三十岁，所以并非因为上了年纪才走得这么慢，只因为她有心脏病。这个女人朝前方扬着她那病怏怏但并不难看的小脸，缓缓走过市场，像一只黑天鹅，满身是悲伤而残破的羽毛。</td>
		<td class="en">To be sure, the retreating figure was ridiculous: small and thin, with a black straw hat, and a rusty cashmere dress hanging full all round the skirt.For so small and frail and rusty a creature to sail with slow, deliberate stride was also absurd.Hilda Rowbotham was less than thirty, so it was not years that set the measure of her pace; she had heart disease.Keeping her face, that was small with sickness, but not uncomely, firmly lifted and fronting ahead, the young woman sailed on past the market-place, like a black swan of mournful, disreputable plumage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她转进了贝里曼面包屋。商店里摆着面包和蛋糕、几袋面粉和燕麦片以及几块熏肉、火腿、猪油和香肠。这些味道混合起来还不算难闻。希尔达·罗博特姆站在那儿等了几分钟，紧张地敲打摆弄着平放在柜台上的一把大刀，眼睛看着那台高高的闪着光的铜秤。终于，一个蓄着浅黄色胡须的男人，面色忧郁地从起居室上面走了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">She turned into Berryman’s, the baker’s.The shop displayed bread and cakes, sacks of flour and oatmeal, flitches of bacon, hams, lard and sausages.The combination of scents was not unpleasing.Hilda Rowbotham stood for some minutes nervously tapping and pushing a large knife that lay on the counter, and looking at the tall, glittering brass scales.At last a morose man with sandy whiskers came down the step from the house-place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要买什么？”他问，并没有为他的拖延而道歉。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is it?” he asked, not apologizing for his delay.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“能给我六便士的什锦蛋糕和酥皮馅饼，外加一些蛋白杏仁甜饼吗？”她紧张而飞快地问道。她的嘴唇颤动着，仿佛两片风中的叶子，吐词急促，就像一群拥挤在门口的羊一般一冲而出。</td>
		<td class="en">“Will you give me six-pennyworth of assorted cakes and pastries—and put in some macaroons, please?” she asked, in remarkably rapid and nervous speech.Her lips fluttered like two leaves in a wind, and her words crowded and rushed like a flock of sheep at a gate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们这儿没有蛋白杏仁甜饼。”这个男人粗鲁地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“We’ve got no macaroons,” said the man churlishly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >显然，他听懂了那个词。他站在那里等着。</td>
		<td class="en">He had evidently caught that word.He stood waiting.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那我就不买了，贝里曼先生。现在我真的感到很失望。我喜欢那些蛋白杏仁甜饼，但我并不经常买给自己吃。想方设法地宠爱自己真累，你觉得呢？这甚至还不如想办法去讨好别人来的划算。”她捂住脸，有些紧张地笑了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">“Then I can’t have any, Mr Berryman.Now I do feel disappointed.I like those macaroons, you know, and it’s not often I treat myself.One gets so tired of trying to spoil oneself, don’t you think?It’s less profitable even than trying to spoil somebody else.”She laughed a quick little nervous laugh, putting her hand to her face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你要买什么？”男人问道，没有回应她一丝微笑。他显然没听懂她的话，所以脸色看起来比刚才更阴沉了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Then what’ll you have?” asked the man, without the ghost of an answering smile.He evidently had not followed, so he looked more glum than ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女教师微微有些脸红，回答说：“哦，你有什么我就买什么吧。”男人慢吞吞地走来走去，从不同的碟子中逐个地取出蛋糕，放入一个纸袋中。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, anything you’ve got,” replied the schoolmistress, flushing slightly.The man moved slowly about, dropping the cakes from various dishes one by one into a paper bag.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的妹妹最近怎么样？”他问道，好像是在和手里的面粉勺说话一样。</td>
		<td class="en">“How’s that sister o’ yours getting on?” he asked, as if he were talking to the flour scoop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你指的是哪一个？”女教师陡然问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Whom do you mean?” snapped the schoolmistress.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个脸色苍白的男人一边弯腰取糕点，一边用嘲讽的语气回答：“最年轻的那位。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The youngest,” answered the stooping, pale-faced man, with a note of sarcasm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“埃玛啊！哦，她很好，谢谢！”女教师涨红了脸，但言辞犀利，带着一丝嘲讽的蔑视。男人嘟哝着什么。然后，他把袋子递给她，看着她走出店，连声“再见”都没对她说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Emma!Oh, she’s very well, thank you!”The schoolmistress was very red, but she spoke with sharp, ironical defiance.The man grunted.Then he handed her the bag and watched her out of the shop without bidding her “Good afternoon”.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她要穿过这一整条主街——足足半英里慢步走的折磨，她羞得脖子都红了。但是她仍旧是一副坚定冷漠的表情，手里拎着那白色的袋子。她转进了田野里，似乎有些疲乏了。宽广的山谷在她面前展开，远处的树林渐渐隐没在暮色之中，在远离中心区的地方，巨大的矿井冒着白烟，随着人们从井下被升上来，矿井发出嚓嚓的响声。一轮玫瑰色的满月从薄雾中升起，就像一只飞得很低的火烈鸟，翱翔在遥远而朦胧的东方。那景色美极了，让她的烦闷和悲伤得以缓和，渐渐消散。</td>
		<td class="en">She had the whole length of the main street to traverse, a half-mile of slow-stepping torture, with shame flushing over her neck.But she carried her white bag with an appearance of steadfast unconcern.When she turned into the field she seemed to droop a little.The wide valley opened out from her, with the far woods withdrawing into twilight, and away in the centre the great pit streaming its white smoke and chuffing as the men were being turned up.A full, rose-coloured moon, like a flamingo flying low under the far, dusky east, drew out of the mist.It was beautiful, and it made her irritable sadness soften, diffuse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >穿过田地，她回到了家。她的家是一幢新建的村舍，很结实，建得十分阔绰，这样一幢房子几乎要花掉一个老矿工所有的积蓄。狭小的厨房里，一个皮肤黝黑、面色暗沉的妇人，穿着长长的白色睡袍坐在那儿看护着婴儿；另一个体型笨重、举止粗鲁的年轻女子则站在桌前切着黄油面包。她脸上挂着一副沮丧谦卑的表情，很不自然，这样子让人莫名其妙地恼火。她姐姐进来时，她甚至没有回头看一眼。希尔达放下那袋蛋糕就离开了厨房，没跟埃玛说一句话，也没跟孩子，还有下午来帮忙的卡林夫人说上一句。</td>
		<td class="en">Across the field, and she was at home.It was a new, substantial cottage, built with unstinted hand, such a house as an old miner could build himself out of his savings.In the rather small kitchen a woman of dark, saturnine complexion sat nursing a baby in a long white gown; a young woman of heavy, brutal cast stood at the table, cutting bread and butter.She had a downcast, humble mien that sat unnaturally on her, and was strangely irritating.She did not look round when her sister entered.Hilda put down the bag of cakes and left the room, not having spoken to Emma, nor to the baby, not to Mrs Carlin, who had come in to help for the afternoon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时，她的父亲端着一簸箕煤从院子里走了进来。他身材高大，但身体却垮了。进门时，他用他那只空着的手紧抓着门框想要站稳，但一转身，还是踉跄地晃了几下。他开始将煤一块块地放入火炉中。一块煤突然从他手中滑落，摔碎在壁炉前白色的地板上。埃玛·罗博特姆回头看了一眼，便开始用粗鲁的大嗓门生气地嚷道：“你看你！”然后她又自觉地缓和了语气。“我一会儿来扫——不用你操心了；你会摔到火里去的。”</td>
		<td class="en">Almost immediately the father entered from the yard with a dustpan full of coals.He was a large man, but he was going to pieces.As he passed through, he gripped the door with his free hand to steady himself, but turning, he lurched and swayed.He began putting the coals on the fire, piece by piece.One lump fell from his hand and smashed on the white hearth.Emma Rowbotham looked round, and began in a rough, loud voice of anger: “Look at you!”Then she consciously moderated her tones.“I’ll sweep it up in a minute—don’t you bother; you’ll only be going head first into the fire.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她的父亲还是弯下腰去收拾自己弄脏的地方，他流着口水，口齿不清地说道：“该死的煤块，它就像一条鱼一样从我手里滑出去了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Her father bent down nevertheless to clear up the mess he had made, saying, articulating his words loosely and slavering in his speech:“The lousy bit of a thing, it slipped between my fingers like a fishi.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他边说着，身子边向火炉倒去。长着一对浓眉的女人便大叫起来；为了避免摔倒，老人把手撑在了滚烫的火炉上；埃玛猛地转身把他拉了开来。</td>
		<td class="en">As he spoke he went tilting towards the fire.The dark-browed woman cried out; he put his hand on the hot stove to save himself; Emma swung round and dragged him off.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“难道我没告诉你吗！”她粗声喊道，“喏，烫到了吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Didn’t I tell you!” she cried roughly.“Now, have you burnt yourself?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她紧紧地搀扶着这位身材高大的老人，把他推到了椅子上。</td>
		<td class="en">She held tight hold of the big man, and pushed him into his chair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么了？”另一间房里有人尖声喊道。说话人进到了屋里，是一位健壮的漂亮女人，今年二十八岁。“埃玛，别那样对父亲说话。”接着，她以一种没那么冷淡但仍然尖锐的语气说：“哎，爸爸，您都做了些什么啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s the matter?” cried a sharp voice from the other room.The speaker appeared, a hard well-favoured woman of twenty-eight.“Emma, don’t speak like that to father.”Then, in a tone not so cold, but just as sharp: “Now, father, what have you been doing?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃玛不高兴地回到了桌子旁。</td>
		<td class="en">Emma withdrew to her table sullenly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没做什么，”老人说，苍白无力地回道，“没什么！继续忙你的吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s nowt,” said the old man, vainly protesting.“It’s nowt, at a’.Get on wi’ what you’re doin’.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >伯莎拉起老人的手看了看，不耐烦地发出了几下啧啧声。</td>
		<td class="en">Bertha took the old man’s hand and looked at it, making a quick tut-tutting noise of impatience.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“埃玛，去拿氧化锌软膏，再拿些白纱布。”她厉声命令道。妹妹放下面包，刀还插在面包上，走了出去。对于一个敏感的旁观者来说，这种顺从比最可恶的反抗，还要让人无法忍受。这个皮肤黝黑的女人俯身贴近孩子，如慈母一般默默地、温柔地呵护着他。孩子笑了，在她的腿上动了起来。孩子不停地扭来扭去。</td>
		<td class="en">“Emma, get that zinc ointment—and some white rag,” she commanded sharply.The younger sister put down her loaf with the knife in it, and went.To a sensitive observer, this obedience was more intolerable than the most hateful discord.The dark woman bent over the baby and made silent, gentle movements of motherliness to it.The little one smiled and moved on her lap.It continued to move and twist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想孩子肯定是饿了，”她说，“他多久没吃东西了？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I believe this child’s hungry,” she said.“How long is it since he had anything?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“午饭前才喂的。”埃玛没精打采地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Just afore dinner,” said Emma dully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天哪！”伯莎大叫道，“你既然有了这个孩子，就不能饿着他。每两个小时喂一次，我告诉过你呀，现在都三点了。抱他去喂奶吧，可怜的小东西——我来切面包。”她弯下腰看了看这个漂亮的孩子。她实在是忍不住自己：笑着用手指按了按他的脸颊，对他点着头，发出一些小噪音。然后，她转过身，接过妹妹手里的面包。女人起身把孩子交给了他母亲。埃玛俯身给小东西喂奶。埃玛一看到他就厌恶，她把他视为一种耻辱的标志，可当她摸到这孩子时，她的爱又会像火一样在她的血液里燃烧。</td>
		<td class="en">“Good gracious!” exclaimed Bertha.“You needn’t starve the child now you’ve got it.Once every two hours it ought to be fed, as I’ve told you; and now it’s three.Take him, poor little mite—I’ll cut the bread.”She bent and looked at the bonny baby.She could not help herself: she smiled, and pressed its cheek with her finger, and nodded to it, making little noises.Then she turned and took the loaf from her sister.The woman rose and gave the child to its mother.Emma bent over the little sucking mite.She hated it when she looked at it, and saw it as a symbol, but when she felt it, her love was like fire in her blood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想他不会来了。”父亲不安地说，抬头看着钟。</td>
		<td class="en">“I should think ‘e canna be comin’,” said the father uneasily, looking up at the clock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别乱说，爸爸——那个钟快了！才四点半！不要着急！”伯莎继续切着黄油面包。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nonsense, father—the clock’s fast!It’s but half-past four!Don’t fidget!”Bertha continued to cut the bread and butter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“开罐梨子，”她对那妇人说，声音温和了许多。随后，她走进了隔壁房间。她一走开，老人又说了起来：“我看他要是打算来的话，现在应该已经到了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Open a tin of pears,” she said to the woman, in a much milder tone.Then she went into the next room.As soon as she was gone, the old man said again: “I should ha’e thought he’d ‘a’ been ‘ere by now, if he means comin’.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃玛正一心喂奶，没有回答。自从她做了那种羞耻的事，父亲就不再关心她了。</td>
		<td class="en">Emma, engrossed, did not answer.The father had ceased to consider her, since she had become humbled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他会来的——他会来的！”来帮忙的妇人确信地说着。</td>
		<td class="en">“‘E’ll come—’e’ll come!” assured the stranger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几分钟后，伯莎解下围裙匆匆走进厨房。狗在疯狂地吠叫。她打开门，命令狗不许乱叫，然后说道：“它现在安静了，肯德尔先生。”</td>
		<td class="en">A few minutes later Bertha hurried into the kitchen, taking off her apron.The dog barked furiously.She opened the door, commanded the dog to silence, and said: “He will be quiet now, Mr Kendal.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谢谢你！”一个洪亮的声音答道，接着就是自行车抵墙停靠的声音。一个牧师走了进来，他骨架虽大，却身材瘦削，相貌丑陋，有点紧张不安。他径直朝她们的父亲走去。</td>
		<td class="en">“Thank you,” said a sonorous voice, and there was the sound of a bicycle being propped against a wall.A clergyman entered, a big-boned, thin, ugly man of nervous manner.He went straight to the father.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呀——您还好吗？”他用悦耳的声音问道，眼光朝下盯着这个身材魁梧却深受脊髓痨折磨的老矿工。</td>
		<td class="en">“Ah—how are you?” he asked musically, peering down on the great frame of the miner, ruined by locomotor ataxy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的声音非常温和，但他似乎看不太清，视物模糊。</td>
		<td class="en">His voice was full of gentleness, but he seemed as if he could not see distinctly, could not get things clear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看到老人手上裹着白纱布，他关切地问道：“您的手受伤了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Have you hurt your hand?” he said comfortingly, seeing the white rag.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没什么，就是一块该死的煤掉了，我的手碰到了火炉上。我以为你不会来了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It wor nowt but a pestered bit o’ coal as dropped, an’ I put my hand on th’ hub.I thought tha worna commin’.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老人的谴责之词以及“你”这个随便的称呼，都无意中表露出他的报复情绪。牧师半是沉思半是宽容地笑了笑。他有着让人捉摸不透的温和。然后，他转向了那位年轻的母亲，而她不高兴地红了脸，因为她令人羞耻的胸部这会儿正袒露在外面。</td>
		<td class="en">The familiar ‘tha’, and the reproach, were unconscious retaliation on the old man’s part.The minister smiled, half wistfully, half indulgently.He was full of vague tenderness.Then he turned to the young mother, who flushed sullenly because her dishonoured breast was uncovered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你还好吗？”他温柔地轻声问道，好像她是一个病人，而他正在关心她。</td>
		<td class="en">“How are you?” he asked, very softly and gently, as if she were ill and he were mindful of her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我很好。”她答道，没有起身，尴尬地握了握牧师的手，埋着头，压抑着心中的怒火。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m all right,” she replied, awkwardly taking his hand without rising, hiding her face and the anger that rose in her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好——好”——他低头看着孩子，孩子正鼓着小嘴吸吮着妈妈挺翘的乳房。“好，好。”他似乎有几分沉思。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes—yes”—he peered down at the baby, which sucked with distended mouth upon the firm breast.“Yes, yes.”He seemed lost in a dim musing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又走过去，心不在焉地同那妇人握了握手。</td>
		<td class="en">Coming to, he shook hands unseeingly with the woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久，大家都进了另一间屋子，牧师犹豫着想去搀扶他那腿脚不便的老执事。</td>
		<td class="en">Presently they all went into the next room, the minister hesitating to help his crippled old deacon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谢谢你，我自己可以走。”老人有点恼火地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I can go by myself, thank yer,” testily replied the father.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快，所有人都坐下了。各人都独自坐在桌边，想着自己的心事。正式茶点摆在厨房的中间，那是一间宽敞而丑陋的房间，专门备来在特殊场合使用。</td>
		<td class="en">Soon all were seated.Everybody was separated in feeling and isolated at table.High tea was spread in the middle kitchen, a large, ugly room kept for special occasions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >希尔达最后一个进来，骨瘦如柴的牧师笨手笨脚起身跟她打招呼。他有点害怕这家人，害怕这个富有的老矿工，还有这些蛮横任性的孩子们。而希尔达是他们当中最出众的一个。她很聪明，还上过大学。她觉得她有责任让这个家里所有成员保持一种高雅的行为标准。罗伯特姆一家与其他普通矿工家庭不同。他们那幢叫做伍德拜恩的村舍比大部分房子都要高级——是老矿工亲手建的，他也以此为豪。她，希尔达，是一位受过大学教育的女教师，尽管家里受到重重打击，她还是一心想要维护家庭的威望。</td>
		<td class="en">Hilda appeared last, and the clumsy, raw-boned clergyman rose to meet her.He was afraid of this family, the well-to-do old collier, and the brutal, self-willed children.But Hilda was queen among them.She was the clever one, and had been to college.She felt responsible for the keeping up of a high standard of conduct in all the members of the family.There was a difference between the Rowbothams and the common collier folk.Woodbine Cottage was a superior house to most—and was built in pride by the old man.She, Hilda, was a college-trained schoolmistress; she meant to keep up the prestige of her house in spite of blows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了这个特别的场合，她特意穿了一条绿色的纱裙。但是她太瘦了，她的脖子费力地伸着。然而，牧师几乎是满怀敬畏地同她问好，她也做出一副庄严的样子，在盘子前坐了下下来。桌子的那端坐着身形魁梧却身体虚弱的父亲。他旁边是最小的女儿，她正看护着怀里动来动去的孩子。牧师坐在希尔达和伯莎中间，不自在地挪动着他那瘦骨嶙峋的身子。</td>
		<td class="en">She had put on a dress of green voile for this special occasion.But she was very thin; her neck protruded painfully.The clergyman, however, greeted her almost with reverence, and, with some assumption of dignity, she sat down before the tray.At the far end of the table sat the broken, massive frame of her father.Next to him was the youngest daughter, nursing the restless baby.The minister sat between Hilda and Bertha, hulking his bony frame uncomfortably.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >桌上摆满了食物，有罐头水果、罐头鲑鱼、火腿和蛋糕。罗伯特姆小姐密切地注意着这一切：她意识到这个场合很重要。这一场庄重的仪式因这位年轻的母亲而起，而她却在闷闷不乐地吃着东西，很不自在。当她感觉到孩子的小手小脚在她腿上活泼地乱动时，她会不自觉地抓住机会朝着孩子沉闷地一笑。伯莎，又厉害又粗鲁，却非常关心这个孩子。她鄙视自己的妹妹，把她当成下流坯。但孩子对她来说，就像一道光芒。而罗博特姆小姐关心的是她的职责和谈吐。她的手不停地抖着，非常紧张，说话就像连珠炮。茶点快结束时，大家都不说话了。老人用红手帕擦了擦嘴，蓝色的眼睛一动不动地盯着某个地方，他流着口水，口齿不清地开始说话了，话是对着牧师说的。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a great spread on the table, of tinned fruits and tinned salmon, ham and cakes.Miss Rowbotham kept a keen eye on everything: she felt the importance of the occasion.The young mother who had given rise to all this solemnity ate in sulky discomfort, snatching sullen little smiles at her child, smiles which came, in spite of her, when she felt its little limbs stirring vigorously on her lap.Bertha, sharp and abrupt, was chiefly concerned with the baby.She scorned her sister, and treated her like dirt.But the infant was a streak of light to her.Miss Rowbotham concerned herself with the function and the conversation.Her hands fluttered; she talked in little volleys exceedingly nervous.Towards the end of the meal, there came a pause.The old man wiped his mouth with his red handkerchief, then, his blue eyes going fixed and staring, he began to speak, in a loose, slobbering fashion, charging his words at the clergyman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，牧师——我们请您来给这个孩子洗礼，您能来，我们确实非常感激。我不能看着这个受上帝庇佑的可怜孩子错过洗礼，但是他们不能进教堂——”他似乎陷入了沉思。“所以，”他继续说道，“我们请你来这里做洗礼。我不是说，这样我们就不难堪，其实，我们很难过。我快不行了，孩子他妈早就走了。我不想我走后我的女儿是现在这样的处境，可是上帝所做的，他已经做了，埋怨是徒劳的……还是有一件事值得欣慰的，为此我们非常感激，那就是：他们从不用为生计发愁。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, mester—we’n axed you to come her ter christen this childt, an’ you’n come, an’ I’m sure we’re very thankful.I can’t see lettin’ the poor blessed childt miss baptizing, an’ they aren’t for goin’ to church wi’t—” He seemed to lapse into a muse.“So,” he resumed, “we’v axed you to come here to do the job.I’m not sayin’ as it’s not ‘ard on us, it is.I’m breakin’ up, an’ mother’s gone.I don’t like leavin’ a girl o’ mine in a situation like ‘ers is, but what the Lord’s done, He’s done, an’ it’s no matter murmuring....There’s one thing to be thankful for, an’ we are thankful for it: they never need know the want of bread.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Miss Rowbotham, the lady of the family, sat very stiff and pained during this discourse.She was sensitive to so many things that she was bewildered.She felt her young sister’s shame, then a kind of swift protecting love for the baby, a feeling that included the mother; she was at a loss before her father’s religious sentiment, and she felt and resented bitterly the mark upon the family, against which the common folk could lift their fingers.Still she winced from the sound of her father’s words.It was a painful ordeal.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Well, we’re all ready,” said the old man, and the clergyman began to read the service.Miss Bertha was godmother, the two men godfathers.The old man sat with bent head.The scene became impressive.At last Miss Bertha took the child and put it in the arms of the clergyman.He, big and ugly, shone with a kind of unreal love.He had never mixed with life, and women were all unliving, Biblical things to him.When he asked for the name, the old man lifted his head fiercely.“Joseph William, after me,” he said, almost out of breath.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Just then heavy footsteps were heard coming up the path, ceasing at the window.The young mother, glancing up, saw her brother, black in his pit dirt, grinning in through the panes.His red mouth curved in a sneer; his fair hair shone above his blackened skin.He caught the eye of his sister and grinned.Then his black face disappeared.He had gone on into the kitchen.The girl with the child sat still and anger filled her heart.She herself hated now the praying clergyman and the whole emotional business; she hated her brother bitterly.In anger and bondage she sat and listened.</td></tr>
