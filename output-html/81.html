		<td class="en">The other day a poet friend of mine, who has lived in close communion with nature all his life, wrote a poem and took it to an editor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这真是一首生动的田园诗，诗中到处充满了田野的自然气息和鸟儿的欢歌悦鸣，还能感觉到小溪潺潺的流水声。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a living pastoral, full of the genuine breath of the fields, the song of birds, and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当诗人再次被编辑叫去时，他心里还希望能够拿到足以吃上一顿牛排的稿费，可是编辑却把稿子退给了他，并评论说：</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们几个约在一起，喝着达切斯县的红葡萄酒，一叉叉地卷起滑溜溜的意大利面，将其连同愤怒一起吞进了肚子。</td>
		<td class="en">Several of us met over spaghetti and Dutchess County chianti, and swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后我们就给那位编辑下了个圈套。和我们一起的是科南特，一个已成名的小说家——一个一辈子生活在城市里的人，他从未见过田园生活的场景，除了坐特快列车时，透过窗户往外厌恶地看两眼。</td>
		<td class="en">And there we dug a pit for the editor.With us was Conant, a well-arrived writer of fiction—a man who had trod on asphalt all his life, and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >科南特写了首诗，并命名为《母鹿与小溪》。他和牧羊女最远也就去过花农的橱窗边，仅有的关于鸟类学的讨论还是和酒吧里的侍者进行的，出自这样一位诗人之手，这首诗也算是一篇佳作了。科南特在诗的末尾署上了自己的姓名，我们把这首诗寄给了同一位编辑。</td>
		<td class="en">Conant wrote a poem and called it “The Doe and the Brook.”It was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with Amaryllis only as far as the florist’s windows, and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter.Conant signed this poem, and we sent it to the same editor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但这和故事本身并没有太大关系。</td>
		<td class="en">But this has very little to do with the story.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天清晨，正当编辑开始审阅这首诗歌时，一位仁兄跌跌撞撞地从西岸渡轮上走下来，慢慢地迈着大步走向第四十二街。</td>
		<td class="en">Just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem, on the next morning, a being stumbled off the West Shore ferryboat, and loped slowly up Forty-second Street.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >来者是个年轻人，浅蓝色的眼睛，下耷的嘴唇，发色和布兰尼先生戏剧里的一个小孤儿（后来发现是伯爵的女儿）一模一样。他上着短袖外套，衣服后背中间还钉有纽扣，下穿灯芯绒裤子。一条裤腿塞在靴子里面。尽管是徒劳，但是你还是满怀希望地打量他的草帽，找那上面的耳孔，因为帽子的形状让人不禁怀疑它是从骑马人的头上抢过来的。他提了个手提箱——那箱子简直无法用语言来描述；一个波士顿人是绝不会用它装着午餐和法律书籍走进办公室的。他一侧耳朵上的头发上还挂着几根干草——这简直是不雅的乡下人的证明、无知的标记、伊甸园里留下来羞辱懒汉的最后记号。</td>
		<td class="en">The invader was a young man with light blue eyes, a hanging lip and hair the exact color of the little orphan’s (afterward discovered to be the earl’s daughter) in one of Mr. Blaney’s plays.His trousers were corduroy, his coat short-sleeved, with buttons in the middle of his back.One bootleg was outside the corduroys.You looked expectantly, though in vain, at his straw hat for ear holes, its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a former equine possessor.In his hand was a valise—description of it is an impossible task; a Boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it.And above one ear, in his hair, was a wisp of hay—the rustic’s letter of credit, his badge of innocence, the last clinging touch of the Garden of Eden lingering to shame the gold-brick men.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >城里人都心领神会地微笑着从他身边经过。他们看到这个粗犷的陌生人站在阴沟边上，伸长了脖子张望高大的建筑。于是人们止住了微笑，甚至开始盯着他看。这样的场景已经是常事了。一些人瞥了瞥他古老的旅行箱，看看他是宣传科尼岛的什么“景点”呢，还是推销什么牌子的口香糖。但大多数人还是把他忽略了。他蹦蹦跳跳、像个小丑似的躲避着来往的车辆，就连报童看了他都觉得厌烦。</td>
		<td class="en">Knowingly, smilingly, the city crowds passed him by.They saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings.At this they ceased to smile, and even to look at him.It had been done so often.A few glanced at the antique valise to see what Coney “attraction” or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory.But for the most part he was ignored.Even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第八大街上站着的是“本库·哈里”，他有一把染了色的胡须，还有双明亮的、透着善意的眼睛。哈里是个好艺术家，每当他看到有人演得过头了便感到不自在。于是哈里移步到那个乡下人边上，看到乡下人停在一个珠宝店的橱窗前张大了嘴巴，他摇了摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">At Eighth Avenue stood “Bunco Harry,” with his dyed mustache and shiny, good-natured eyes.Harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part.He edged up to the countryman, who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store window, and shook his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太过头了，哥们儿，”他不无批判地说，“简直演得太过头了。我不知道你在演什么，但是你把特征表现得太明显了。就那干草，现在——知道吗，就连普罗克特马戏团都不用来当道具了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Too thick, pal,” he said, critically—“too thick by a couple of inches.I don’t know what your lay is; but you’ve got the properties too thick.That hay, now—why, they don’t even allow that on Proctor’s circuit any more.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不知道你在说什么，先生。”乡下人说道，“我不是来找马戏团的。我只是从阿尔斯特县来市里看看，刚好收割完干草嘛。天呐！这儿简直太大了。我一直以为波基普西已经很了不起了呢；然而这个市足足是它的五倍大。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I don’t understand you, mister,” said the green one.“I’m not lookin’ for any circus.I’ve just run down from Ulster County to look at the town, bein’ that the hayin’s over with.Gosh! but it’s a whopper.I thought Poughkeepsie was some punkins; but this here town is five times as big.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，那好吧，”“本库·哈里”扬起眉头说道，“我并不是有意来插话的。你也没必要告诉我什么。我想你说话应该稍微温和点儿，我只是想要给你点建议。希望你的辛苦工作能够获得成功，不管是什么工作。不管怎样，过来随便喝一杯吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, well,” said “Bunco Harry,” raising his eyebrows, “I didn’t mean to butt in.You don’t have to tell.I thought you ought to tone down a little, so I tried to put you wise.Wish you success at your graft, whatever it is.Come and have a drink, anyhow.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“来一杯淡啤酒我倒不介意。”对方应和道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I wouldn’t mind having a glass of lager beer,” acknowledged the other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们进了一家油嘴滑舌、贼眉鼠眼的人经常光顾的酒吧，坐了下来要了酒。</td>
		<td class="en">They went to a café frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes, and sat at their drinks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很高兴碰到你，先生，”海洛克斯说，“你想不想玩一两局七分牌戏？我带了牌。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m glad I come across you, mister,” said Haylocks.“How’d you like to play a game or two of seven-up?I’ve got the keerds.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他从那貌似诺亚时代的行李箱子里掏出一副牌——一副罕见且无与伦比的纸牌，上面满是晚餐桌上熏猪肉的油脂，还沾了点小麦田里的泥土。</td>
		<td class="en">He fished them out of Noah’s valise—a rare, inimitable deck, greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“本库·哈里”急促而大声地笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Bunco Harry” laughed loud and briefly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这种把戏我可不玩儿，老兄。”他坚定地说，“我一丁点儿都不反对你的装扮。但是我还是想说，你表演得过头了。鲁博斯剧团从79年开始就不这么装扮了。我恐怕你那身行头在布鲁克林连一块上发条的怀表都弄不到。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not for me, sport,” he said, firmly.“I don’t go against that make-up of yours for a cent.But I still say you’ve overdone it.The Reubs haven’t dressed like that since ’79.I doubt if you could work Brooklyn for a key-winding watch with that layout.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，你可别以为我没钱。”海洛克斯吹嘘道。他往桌上扔了一卷紧紧捆着的钞票，有茶杯口那么粗。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, you needn’t think I ain’t got the money,” boasted Haylocks.He drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup, and laid it on the table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这笔钱是从我奶奶的农场那儿分来的。”他声称，“这一卷一共950美金。我打算来市里到处转转，看看有没有什么可做的买卖。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Got that for my share of grandmother’s farm,” he announced.“There’s $950 in that roll.Thought I’d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“本库·哈里”拿起那卷钱微笑地看着，眼里几乎带着尊敬。</td>
		<td class="en">“Bunco Harry” took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我见过更差劲的。”他批判地说道，“但是穿这身儿是绝对不行的。你应该穿淡棕褐色的鞋，配上黑色西服，再戴一顶系有彩带的草帽，大谈特谈匹兹堡或是货物差价，早餐时你应该来一杯雪利酒，好做这些骗人的事儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’ve seen worse,” he said, critically.“But you’ll never do it in them clothes.You want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band, and talk a good deal about Pittsburg and freight differentials, and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是干哪行的？”在海洛克斯收起他那受到责难的钱离开后，两三个贼眉鼠眼的人问“本库·哈里”。</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s his line?” asked two or three shifty-eyed men of “Bunco Harry” after Haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“应该是脑子有毛病，我想，”哈里说，“要不就是杰尔姆人。或者是玩什么新把戏的。他简直就像是个乡巴佬。也许他——我现在开始怀疑了——噢，不，那绝对不可能是真钱。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The queer, I guess,” said Harry.“Or else he’s one of Jerome’s men.Or some guy with a new graft.He’s too much hayseed.Maybe that his—I wonder now—oh, no, it couldn’t have been real money.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >海洛克斯继续闲逛。也许他又觉得口渴了，他进了街道旁一个幽暗的小酒吧，要了啤酒。几个泡在酒吧里的人第一眼看到他时，眼睛都发亮了，但当他再三将他夸张的乡巴佬气息表现出来时，那些人的表情变成了谨慎和怀疑。</td>
		<td class="en">Haylocks wandered on.Thirst probably assailed him again, for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer.At first sight of him their eyes brightened; but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >海洛克斯提起手提箱横放在吧台上。</td>
		<td class="en">Haylocks swung his valise across the bar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请为我看管一会儿，先生，”他咬着一只棕黄色雪茄头说，“我出去转转就回来。你得留心看管，里面有950美金，尽管你看我的样子不觉得是这样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Keep that a while for me, mister,” he said, chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar.“I’ll be back after I knock around a spell.And keep your eye on it, for there’s $950 inside of it, though maybe you wouldn’t think so to look at me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外面不知哪儿的留声机在放一个乐队的唱片，海洛克斯循声而去，他外套后摆中间的扣子滑落了。</td>
		<td class="en">Somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece, and Haylocks was off for it, his coat-tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把钱分了吧，迈克。”泡在吧台前的几个人彼此使了个眼色，而且毫不掩饰。</td>
		<td class="en">“Divvy, Mike,” said the men hanging upon the bar, winking openly at one another.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“还是别犯傻了，老兄，”酒保边说边把箱子踢到了边上，“你们该不会以为我会对这动心吧？谁都看得出来他不是个呆子。我猜他是麦卡杜诱捕小队的一员吧。如果他不打扮一下就太显眼了。现在全国各地根本不可能有这样穿着打扮的人，因为他们享受到罗得岛普罗维登斯的农村免费投递服务。如果说他那箱子里真有950的话，那一定是有一只98美分的沃特伯里牌钟表，指针停在了九点五十。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Honest, now,” said the bartender, kicking the valise to one side.“You don’t think I’d fall to that, do you?Anybody can see he ain’t no jay.One of McAdoo’s come-on squad, I guess.He’s a shine if he made himself up.There ain’t no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to Providence, Rhode Island.If he’s got nine-fifty in that valise it’s a ninety-eight cent Waterbury that’s stopped at ten minutes to ten.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >海洛克斯尽情享受了爱迪生先生提供的消遣后，返回酒吧取行李箱。接着，他又开始在百老汇街上游逛起来，他那热切的蓝眼睛不停地东张西望。然而，在百老汇，人们对他投以同样的甚至更多的唐突眼光和讥讽微笑。他成了这个城市必须容忍的最老式的“噱头”了。他简直丑恶至极，极端粗野，甚至比谷仓里、草地上以及杂耍舞台上最奇异的东西还要夸张，只会令人乏味和让人怀疑。他头上的干草既真实又新鲜，有着牧场的味道，就连玩贝壳游戏的人看到他都会收拾豆子、折起桌子走人。</td>
		<td class="en">When Haylocks had exhausted the resources of Mr. Edison to amuse he returned for his valise.And then down Broadway he gallivanted, culling the sights with his eager blue eyes.But still and evermore Broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles.He was the oldest of the “gags” that the city must endure.He was so flagrantly impossible, so ultra rustic, so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard, the hayfield and the vaudeville stage, that he excited only weariness and suspicion.And the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine, so fresh and redolent of the meadows, so clamorously rural that even a shell-game man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >海洛克斯坐在一级石阶上，又一次从他那行李箱里拿出那卷钞票。最外面的一张，是张二十的，他剥下了那张票子示意一个报童过来。</td>
		<td class="en">Haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellow-backs from the valise.The outer one, a twenty, he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“孩子，”他说，“到哪儿帮我兑下这钱。我几乎没零钱。我想如果你跑得快的话，我会给你五分钱作为回报。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Son,” said he, “run somewhere and get this changed for me.I’m mighty nigh out of chicken feed.I guess you’ll get a nickel if you’ll hurry up.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >报童脏兮兮的脸上显出一副被伤害的表情。</td>
		<td class="en">A hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy’s face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“做美梦吧你！你自己去换那张假钞票吧。你穿的才不是乡下人的衣服。别拿那些道具假钱糊弄人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Aw, watchert’ink!G’wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself.Dey ain’t no farm clothes yer got on.G’wan wit yer stage money.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >街道拐角处倚着一个眼光锐利的、为赌场拉客的骗子。他看到了海洛克斯，表情顿时变得冷酷而正直。</td>
		<td class="en">On a corner lounged a keen-eyed steerer for a gambling-house.He saw Haylocks, and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“先生，”乡下人招呼道，“我听说这里有个地方可以好好玩玩七分牌戏或是基诺游戏。我这箱子里有950美金，我来自阿尔斯特县，来这里开开眼界。你知道哪里有花个九块十块就能玩的游戏吗？我想玩几把，可以的话我打算自己开个类似的赌场。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mister,” said the rural one.“I’ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno.I got $950 in this valise, and I come down from old Ulster to see the sights.Know where a fellow could get action on about $9 or $10?I’m goin’ to have some sport, and then maybe I’ll buy out a business of some kind.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >骗子研究着自己左手食指指甲上的一块白斑，一脸痛苦的样子。</td>
		<td class="en">The steerer looked pained, and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“算了吧，老兄，”他责备似的嘟囔着，“总署派你来视察还让你穿得跟个随从似的，真是神经有问题。你就算跑两条街也未必能抓到一个掷色子的街头赌徒。最近那个来自死亡谷的斯科蒂先生看见你在一个穿过市区的街区徘徊，就在伊丽莎白景区和机械配件厂附近的路上。你就这么干吧。我可不知道哪里有金碧辉煌的大厅能让巡逻的人玩牌。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Cheese it, old man,” he murmured, reproachfully.“The Central Office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie.You couldn’t get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them Tony Pastor props.The recent Mr. Scotty from Death Valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of Elizabethan scenery and mechanical accessories.Let it be loria for yours.Nay, I know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon on the ace.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >再次遭到善于辨识真伪的城里人的排斥，海洛克斯便在马路边上坐下，思考起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities, Haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一定是我的衣服惹的祸，”他说，“不是就怪了。他们一定认为我是个乡巴佬才不愿意搭理我的。要是在阿尔斯特县，根本不会有人嘲笑这顶帽子的。我想要是想让纽约人注意到你，你就一定要像他们那样装扮。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s my clothes,” said he; “durned if it ain’t.They think I’m a hayseed and won’t have loria’ to do with me.Nobody never made fun of this hat in Ulster County.I guess if you want folks to notice you in New York you must dress up like they do.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说罢，海洛克斯去了百货商店购物。商店里面的售货员窃窃私语，随后搓搓手拿起卷尺给他量腰身，感觉到他里面的口袋很鼓，就对他极为热情，而那口袋里只是均匀的几排红穗玉米。送货的一个接一个地将大包小包送到海洛克斯下榻的酒店。酒店位于百老汇大街上，被朗埃克广场的灯光笼罩着。</td>
		<td class="en">So Haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the bulge in his inside pocket where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows.And messengers bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on Broadway within the lights of Long Acre.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚上九点，一个阿尔斯特县人发誓绝对不会认识的人从酒店出来走上人行道。他的鞋是锃亮的褐色；他的帽子是最新的款式。他浅灰色的裤子上有着清晰的折痕，一块鲜艳的蓝色丝帕插在他那优雅的英式散步服的前胸口袋里。他的衣领可以给洗衣店的橱窗增光，他金色的头发也剪短了，头上那几根干草都不知去向。</td>
		<td class="en">At 9 o’clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom Ulster County would have foresworn.Bright tan were his shoes; his hat the latest block.His light gray trousers were deeply creased; a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant English walking coat.His collar might have graced a laundry window; his blond hair was trimmed close; the wisp of hay was gone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他光彩照人地站了一会儿，又像花花公子那样慢悠悠地逛着，寻思着晚上去哪儿找乐子。接着，他便迈着百万富翁似的优雅步伐不慌不忙地往那条不夜街走去了。</td>
		<td class="en">For an instant he stood, resplendent, with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening pleasures.And then he turned down the gay, bright street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但就在他止步的一刹那，他已经被这座城市里最精明、最尖的眼睛盯住了，那人将他上下打量了个遍。一个灰眼睛、粗壮结实的人瞥向旅馆门口的一排游手好闲的人，扬了扬眉头，挑出了两个同伙。</td>
		<td class="en">But in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision.A stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是我六个月以来看到的最肥的了，”灰眼睛的那个人说，“跟上。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The juiciest jay I’ve seen in six months,” said the man with gray eyes.“Come along.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >十一点半时，一个人慌慌张张跑到西四十七街警察局报告，说他遭人抢了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was half-past eleven when a man galloped into the West Forty-seventh Street Police Station with the story of his wrongs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“950美元，”他上气不接下气地说，“我奶奶卖掉农场分给我的那笔钱的全部。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nine hundred and fifty dollars,” he gasped, “all my share of grandmother’s farm.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >警官询问后得知劫犯是阿尔斯特县蝗谷农场的杰贝兹·布尔顿，接着便开始记录那个暴匪的特征。</td>
		<td class="en">The desk sergeant wrung from him the name Jabez Bulltongue, of Locust Valley farm, Ulster County, and then began to take descriptions of the strong-arm gentlemen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >科南特去找编辑，看看他的诗歌能否被采用，他被勤杂员带进了里间，那里摆着罗丹和J. G. 布朗的雕像。</td>
		<td class="en">When Conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem, he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by Rodin and J. G. Brown.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当我开始读《母鹿与小溪》时，”编辑说道，“我就知道这个作品的作者一定是一个与大自然心心相通的人。诗歌字里行间的精湛技艺也掩盖不了这一事实。打个简单点的比方，这就好比山林里自由狂野的孩子穿上时髦的衣服走在百老汇大街上。然而，他服饰底下的本色依然能表现出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“When I read the first line of ‘The Doe and the Brook,’” said the editor, “I knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with Nature.The finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact.To use a somewhat homely comparison, it was as if a wild, free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down Broadway.Beneath the apparel the man would show.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谢谢。”科南特回应，“我想这次的稿费支票依旧会像往常那样在周四时如期而至吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Thanks,” said Conant.“I suppose the check will be round on Thursday, as usual.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个故事的道理好像被弄混淆了。你可以自己决定，是“继续呆在农场”，还是“再也不要写诗了”。</td>
		<td class="en">The morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed.You can take your choice of “Stay on the Farm” or “Don’t Write Poetry.”</td></tr>
