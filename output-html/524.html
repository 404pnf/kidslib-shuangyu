		<td class="en">于是，他没有对此提出任何异议。他一准备好东西，就带着这份新而高贵的礼物，动身前往尼科百德。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This time the prince, too, was embarrassed, and questioned the merchant closely.</td>
		<td class="en">这次，王子也感到为难，就一个劲地询问商人。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The merchant felt that his credit was at stake, and whilst inwardly determining that he would not carry the joke any further, could not help describing Wali Dad in such glowing terms that the old man would never have known himself had he heard them.</td>
		<td class="en">商人感到他的信誉已岌岌可危，同时暗暗下定决心不再继续开这个玩笑了，他禁不住用那些热情洋溢之词来描绘瓦利·戴德，所以这个老人将不会知道别人口中的自己了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The prince, like the king of Khaistan, determined that he would send in return a gift that would be truly royal, and which would perhaps prevent the unknown giver sending him anything more.</td>
		<td class="en">这位王子——像海斯坦的国王一样——决定将送出一份真正高贵的回馈礼物，这也许将会阻止那位陌生赠与者再送给他任何东西了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >So he made up a caravan on twenty splendid horses caparisoned in gold embroidered cloths, with fine morocco saddles and silver bridles and stirrups, also twenty camels of the best breed, which had the speed of race-horses, and could swing along at a trot all day without getting tired; and, lastly, twenty elephants, with magnificent silver howdahs and coverings of silk embroidered with pearls.</td>
		<td class="en">因此，他组建了一支大商队：二十匹的好马，它们用金色刺绣衣、摩洛哥皮革材质的马鞍和银色的缰绳以及马镫做装饰；二十头最好品种的骆驼，它们拥有着赛马的速度，能一整天小跑转向而不感到累；最后，还有二十头大象，大象身上放着华丽的银色象轿和铺着绣有珍珠的丝绸毯子。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >To take care of these animals the merchant hired a little army of men; and the troop made a great show as they travelled along.</td>
		<td class="en">为了照顾好这些动物，商人雇用了一小队武装人员。当他们一路前行时，这队人马出尽了风头。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >When Wali Dad from a distance saw the cloud of dust which the caravan made, and the glitter of its appointments, he said to himself: ‘By Allah! here’s a grand crowd coming!</td>
		<td class="en">当瓦利·戴德在不远处看到这支商队扬起的漫天尘埃和装饰设备的闪闪发光，他自言自语道：“真主阿拉，这儿来了一队盛大的人马啊！</td></tr>

		<td class="en">一回来，他就发现商队已经停在了他家门口，商人有点儿着急，正等着去告诉他这个消息，并祝贺他的万贯财富。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >‘Riches!’ cried Wali Dad, ‘what has an old man like me with one foot in the grave to do with riches?</td>
		<td class="en">“财富！”瓦利·戴德嚷道，“像我这样行将就木的人要这些财富做什么呢？</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >That beautiful young princess, now!</td>
