		<td class="en">我的老主人在兄弟中排行第八，虽非高龄，却有些未老先衰，行动不怎么灵活；他经常穿着衬里长衫坐在壁炉边读书，本来就少言寡语，得罪人的话更是从不出口，看起来就像是一位退休老管家；不过他博学广读，自然不会头脑简单，乡里盛传他远远没有看似那般好说话。</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >This luck or dexterity got him several ill-wishers, but with the rest of the country, enhanced his reputation; so that great things were looked for in his future, when he should have gained more gravity.</td>
		<td class="en">他在这方面可谓小运连连，技巧纯熟，可同时也给自己招来了不少怨怼，乡下地方，流言就跟得了水的野草一样疯长；本一个前途无量的大好青年，就这么在本该更稳重的年月葬送掉了自己的好名声。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >One very black mark he had to his name; but the matter was hushed up at the time, and so defaced by legends before I came into those parts, that I scruple to set it down.</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >I think it notable that he had always vaunted himself quite implacable, and was taken at his word; so that he had the addition among his neighbours of “an ill man to cross.”</td>
		<td class="en">我还发现他总是标榜自己爱憎分明，觉得自己说什么人家都信；邻里只得又给他加了个“实难相处”的评价。</td></tr>

		<td class="en">老主人对这笔钱趋之若鹜——实际上家里很多地产都已经被抵押出去了，所以他想让艾莉森小姐成为这家未来的主母，以婚事解决财事。女方对这事，那是满心欢喜；至于男方打的什么主意，又是另一回事了。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >She was a comely girl, and in those days very spirited and self-willed; for the old lord having no daughter of his own, and my lady being long dead, she had grown up as best she might.</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >The adventure tempted him, as I conceive; he was tempted by the opportunity to raise the fortunes of the house, and not less by the hope of paying off his private liabilities, which were heavy beyond all opinion.</td>
		<td class="en">我琢磨着，对大少爷来说，打仗一来可以满足他那期待冒险、躁动不安的心；二来可以为家族带来更多的财富；但最投他所好的，就是他可以发发战争财，把他的那些私债填平。</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >As for Mr. Henry, it appears he said little enough at first; his part came later on.</td>

		<td class="en">老主人、艾莉森小姐和亨利先生一致认为：出门打仗是幺儿干的事；可本来就被打仗引得心神不定、个性又狂妄自负的大少爷则根本就不同意留在家里。</td></tr>
